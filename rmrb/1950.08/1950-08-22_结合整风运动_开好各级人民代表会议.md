Combining the Rectification Movement
Successfully Convene People's Representative Conferences at All Levels

　　To successfully convene people's representative conferences at all levels, and to conduct inspections and criticisms of the work style of government cadres at all levels, is one of the important methods to overcome the bureaucratic and commandist work style of government workers, and to closely connect the government with the people. In the rectification movement, it is even more necessary to rectify the work style of government workers through people's representative conferences at all levels.

　　Beijing has already achieved preliminary results and experience in this regard. Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, in his report to Chairman Mao on the situation and plan of the party rectification work in Beijing, pointed out when talking about the rectification situation of district-level cadres: "Since May this year, four districts have conducted a movement to inspect the work style of cadres and check discipline through the district people's representative conference, mainly checking commandism and corruption. In another month, the district people's representative conference in the urban area can be held universally." Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Consultative Committee, in his "Report on Convening the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the District" to the Third Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, affirmed the achievements and gains of the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in the District in this regard, and pointed out: This kind of meeting "enables the government and cadres to be supervised and criticized by the people, thus quickly overcoming many shortcomings in the work and improving the effectiveness of the work. This not only strengthens the cadres' view of being responsible to the people and serving the people, and gives a great blow to bureaucracy and commandism. At the same time, it also makes it easier for the people to quickly improve their consciousness as masters through the experience of actual democratic life."

　　At present, four more districts in Beijing have held the People's Representative Conference of All Circles, and only one district has not yet opened and is about to convene. All those that have been convened have carried out inspections of the work style of cadres, and the effect has been very good. Facts have proven that the method of rectifying the work style of government cadres in Beijing is correct. This method is not only applicable to cities, but also to rural areas; not only applicable to the district level, but also to people's representative conferences at all levels. Because, through this method, the mass criticism from bottom to top can be combined with the work of inspection and summary from top to bottom. Only our new democratic regime can allow the broad masses of the people to directly exercise state power, listen to the government's work report at the people's congresses at all levels elected by universal suffrage or the people's representative conferences of all circles at all levels that exercise the functions of the people's congress before the universal suffrage, and review the government's work and the work style of government workers; and only when the broad masses of the people in our country can actually manage the state power, thus love their own regime, hate the bad work style of bureaucracy and commandism, and dare to wage a resolute struggle against it, will bureaucracy and all other bad styles lose their social basis for existence.

　　In order to enable the people's representative conferences of all circles to conduct inspections and criticisms of the work style of government workers in a practical and serious manner, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to put forward opinions on the work of the government and the work style of government cadres before the meeting, and to conduct this in various ways that are convenient for the masses to express their opinions, and then concentrate on the meeting. At the meeting, it is necessary to fully promote democracy, so that every representative has the right to speak, and dares to criticize the shortcomings and errors of the government's work and the work style of government cadres. On this point, Chairman Mao also gave clear instructions in the report of the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China: "It is necessary to give the representatives attending the people's representative conference full right to speak, and any action that suppresses the speech of the people's representatives is wrong." That is to say, it is necessary to achieve the level of "knowing everything, saying everything; those who speak are innocent, those who hear should take warning."

　　With the mobilization of the masses before the meeting and the full democracy of the meeting, the mass criticism has the necessary conditions, but it is not a sufficient condition. The sufficient condition is to make the masses feel that the criticism is effective; and will not be retaliated by individual cadres because of criticizing the work style of cadres. Regarding the former, leading cadres of governments at all levels must take the lead and humbly accept criticisms from the masses and representatives at the people's representative conference; especially for correct criticisms, they must immediately conduct a deep self-criticism at the meeting with an attitude of being responsible to the people. Regarding the latter, individual cadres who take retaliatory actions against the masses or representatives have committed a serious error of principle. If discovered, governments at all levels should immediately deal with it, give the cadres who have made mistakes the due punishment, and report the handling process to the people's representative conference or to the consultative committee during the adjournment of the representative conference. This not only guarantees the masses and representatives to legally exercise their rights, but also encourages the enthusiasm of the masses and representatives. In this way, mass criticism will naturally develop smoothly. When mass supervision and criticism are carried out smoothly, bureaucracy, commandism and all other bad styles will have nowhere to hide.

　　The people's democratic regime guarantees that we can fully adopt this democratic method to carry out self-education and transformation within the people. Chairman Mao had already specifically and clearly instructed us on this path in his article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship." He said: "With the people's state, the people have the opportunity to educate themselves and transform themselves on a nationwide and overall scale by democratic methods, so that they can get rid of the influence of internal and external reactionaries (this influence is still very large and will exist for a long time, and cannot be eliminated quickly), and transform their bad habits and bad thoughts from the old society,..." And in the closing speech of the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Mao said: "In this meeting, we have adopted the method of criticism and self-criticism based on the Common Program. This is a very good method, a good method to promote everyone to adhere to the truth and correct mistakes, and the only correct method for all revolutionary people in the people's country to carry out self-education and self-transformation."

　　Since the people's congresses at all levels or the people's representative conferences of all circles at all levels that exercise the functions of the people's congress are the organs for the people to exercise state power, and are the basic organizational forms of the people's regime; and we also have a democratic method for self-education and self-transformation within the people, that is, the method of criticism and self-criticism, then, as long as we closely combine this excellent people's democratic system with the correct method of self-transformation, and correctly and fully apply it, the bad habits and bad influences left over from the old society, such as the tendencies of bureaucracy and commandism that currently exist in the work style of some government cadres, will inevitably gradually shrink their territory, and eventually be eliminated.

　　At present, we should closely combine democratic construction and the rectification movement, successfully convene people's representative conferences of all circles at all levels, and further universally rectify the work style of our government workers at all levels.

### 结合整风运动  开好各级人民代表会议

　　结合整风运动
    开好各级人民代表会议
    开好各级各界人民代表会议，进行对各级政府工作干部作风的检查与批评，这是克服政府工作人员的官僚主义和命令主义作风，密切政府与人民联系的重要方法之一。在整风运动中，经过各界人民代表会议来整顿政府工作人员的作风，更是必要的。
    北京市在这一方面已经取得了初步的成绩和经验。中共北京市委书记彭真同志在向毛主席报告北京市关于整党工作的情况和计划中，说到区级干部的整风情况时曾指出：“今年五月以来，已有四个区经过区人民代表会议，进行了检查干部作风和检查纪律的运动，主要是检查命令主义和贪污腐化。再有一个月，城区的区人民代表会议可以普遍开一次。”北京市协商委员会钱端升副主席向北京市第二届第三次人民代表会议所作“关于召开区各界人民代表会议的报告”中，对于区各界人民代表会议在这方面的成就和收获，肯定地指出：这种会议，“使政府和干部得到人民的监督与批评，因而迅速克服了很多工作中的缺点，提高了工作的效能。这样不仅加强了干部对人民负责、为人民服务的观点，给官僚主义和命令主义以很大打击。同时，也更易使人民从实际的民主生活体验中迅速提高主人翁的自觉。”
    目前北京市又有四个区已举行了各界人民代表会议，未开而即将召开的只有一个区。凡是已经召开的，都进行了对干部的作风检查，效果都是很好的。事实业已证明，北京市所进行的这一个整顿政府工作干部作风的方法是正确的。这个方法不但适用于城市，而且适用于乡村；不但适用于区级，而且适用于各级的人民代表会议。因为，通过了这种方法，才可以使自下而上的群众性的批评，与自上而下的检查与总结工作结合起来。只有我们新民主主义的政权制度，才能够由广大人民来直接行使政权，在普选的各级人民代表大会或普选前代行代表大会职权的各级各界人民代表会议上，听取政府的工作报告，并审查政府工作及政府工作人员的作风；也只有当着我国广大人民能够实际管理政权，因而热爱自己的政权，痛恨着官僚主义、命令主义的恶劣作风，并敢于向它作坚决斗争的时候，官僚主义及一切其他的歪风才会失却其存在的社会基础。
    为了使各界人民代表会议能够切实而认真地进行对政府工作人员作风的检查与批评，就要在会前好好地去发动群众对政府工作及政府干部的作风提意见，并且用各种便于群众表达意见的方式来进行，然后再集中到会议上去。在会议上要充分发扬民主，使每个代表都有权说话，并且敢于批评政府工作和政府干部工作作风的缺点和错误。关于这一点，毛主席在中共中央七届三中全会的报告中也有明确的指示：“必须使出席人民代表会议的代表们有充分的发言权，任何压制人民代表发言的行动都是错误的。”也就是说要做到“知无不言，言无不尽；言者无罪，闻者足戒”的地步。
    有了会前的发动群众和会议的充分民主，就使群众性的批评具备了必要的条件，但还不是足够的条件。足够的条件是要使群众感觉到批评是有效的；而且不会因为批评了干部的作风而遭受到个别干部的报复。关于前者，就必须各级政府领导干部以身作则，在人民代表会议上虚心接受来自群众及代表的批评；尤其对正确的批评，要立即以对人民负责的态度，在会议上进行深刻的检讨。关于后者，向群众或代表采取报复行为的个别干部，那是犯了原则性的严重的错误，如有发现，各级政府应立即进行处理，对犯了错误的干部给以应有的处分，并将处理经过向人民代表会议或在代表会议休会期间向协商委员会提出报告。这样既保障了群众和代表合法地行使自己的权力，又鼓励了群众和代表的积极性。这样，群众性的批评自然就会顺利地开展起来。当群众性的监督与批评顺利开展的时候，官僚主义、命令主义及一切其他的歪风，也就无处藏身了。
    人民民主的政权制度，保证了我们能够充分采取这种民主的方法来进行人民内部的自我教育与改造。毛主席在《论人民民主专政》一文中，早已具体而明确地给我们指示了这条道路。他说：“有了人民的国家，人民才有可能，在全国范围内和全体规模上，用民主的方法，教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将在长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭），改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，……”而在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议的闭幕词中，毛主席又说：“我们在这次会议中，即根据共同纲领，采取了批评和自我批评的方法。这是一个很好的方法，是推动大家坚持真理、修正错误的很好的方法，是人民国家内全体革命人民进行自我教育和自我改造的惟一正确的方法。”
    既然各级人民代表大会或代行代表大会职权的各级人民代表会议，是人民行使政权的机关，是人民政权的基本组织形式；我们又有了在人民内部进行自我教育和自我改造的民主的方法，即批评与自我批评的方法，那末，只要我们把这种优良的人民民主制度，和正确的自我改造的方法，紧密地结合起来，并正确地充分地加以运用，旧社会所遗留下来的坏习惯和坏影响，如目前在一部分政府干部工作作风中存在的官僚主义、命令主义等倾向，必然会逐渐地缩小地盘，以至于最后消灭。
    目前我们应该把民主建政工作和整风运动紧密结合起来，开好各级各界人民代表会议，进一步普遍地整顿我们各级政府工作人员的工作作风。
