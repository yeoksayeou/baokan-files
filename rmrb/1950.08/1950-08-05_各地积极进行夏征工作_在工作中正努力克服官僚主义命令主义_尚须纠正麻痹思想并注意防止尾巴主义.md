Xinhua News Agency, 4th. With the wheat harvest over and early rice also on the market, various locations are actively carrying out the summer public grain collection work.

This year, fifteen provinces and districts, and the suburbs of three cities are carrying out summer grain collection, namely: Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Chahar, Shandong, Fujian, Subei, northern Anhui (the part north of the Huai River), Henan, Hubei (a portion), Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and the suburbs of the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Xi'an. At the same time, in order to take care of the lives of farmers and enable them to accumulate agricultural capital, the Central People's Government has reduced the summer grain collection task by more than 800 million jin compared to the original 1950 estimate.

As of now, the summer grain collection work in most areas has entered the stage of delivering grain to the granaries. Some counties and districts have already victoriously completed the collection task. The Fujian and Guangdong regions, which started arrangements later, are preparing to start collection in early and mid-August, and it is expected that all will be in the granaries by the end of August or early September. As of now, Shanxi Province has completed 125,873,257 jin, reaching 76.47% of the assigned quota. Zhao County in Hebei Province and the counties of Xishui, Yingcheng, Huangpi, and Mianyang in Hubei Province had basically completed the task of delivering grain to the granaries in early July.

When starting to arrange the summer grain collection work, various locations generally convened cadre meetings from top to bottom to convey the summer grain collection policy and review the shortcomings in last year's autumn grain collection. They were required to strive to overcome the style of bureaucratism and commandism in this summer grain collection. Most counties and districts convened people's representative conferences or farmer representative conferences to discuss the summer grain collection policy, assign tasks, and mobilize the masses of farmers to actively pay public grain.

Some regions prepared well, grasped more accurate materials, and the collection was relatively smooth. For example, in Zhao County, Hebei, before the wheat collection was arranged, the county's finance section focused on investigating typical villages with high, medium, and low yields. At the same time, the financial assistants of each district and the leaders of the work groups sent by the county government to each district to guide production were responsible for surveying the annual yield of general villages. In addition, the People's Government and the CCP Zhao County Committee separately convened forums of village cadres and branch committee members from seven or eight villages in each district to understand the situation in each village. During the collection, cadres and party members took the lead to eliminate the ideas of procrastination and wait-and-see attitude among some of the masses. Due to sufficient prior preparation, overcoming coercion and command, and in-depth propaganda, the county started collection on July 5 and completed it all by the 11th. At the beginning of the summer grain collection, Fencheng, Shanxi, established grain collection committees at all levels to strengthen the leadership of the collection work. The county magistrate, the secretary of the CCP county committee, and other cadres went to various districts, divided base points, and implemented the policy in a step-by-step and planned manner. They changed the past severe commandism style of cadres in the work, and the masses all actively paid their public grain within seven days.

Some regions did not do a good job of investigation work beforehand. When arranging the work, the cadres could not accept it, saying that the yield was set too high and the land area was calculated too much. After typical investigations, it was proved that they themselves did not grasp enough materials and blindly shouted that the task was heavy. After breaking through a point, conducting in-depth investigation, and clarifying the actual situation, the cadres' thinking changed. For example, Tong County in Hebei concentrated its efforts on investigating Xiaojie Village in the Sixth District. The village originally reported 512 mu of wheat land, with an average yield of 90 jin of wheat per mu. After going deep into the masses to conduct propaganda and explanation, so that the masses understood the policy, the registered wheat land per household was 620.88 mu, with an average yield of 93 jin per mu. The original assigned task was 6,686 jin. After this investigation, according to the tax rate, it should bear 8,380 jin, which is more than 25% higher than the original fixed number. In addition, some counties and districts neither seriously investigated and studied beforehand, nor did they do typical promotion work during the collection, staying at general appeals, arrangements, and transmissions. As a result of such empty meetings and appeals, the work did not progress. Experience in various places proves that continuing to deeply mobilize the masses and finding out the land yield is the key to implementing the policy and completing the task.

At present, there are two serious ideological problems among cadres: First, most cadres believe that the task is lighter than last year, and they have developed complacency, thinking that completing the task is easy. Second, because various places have emphasized correcting the style of commandism and bureaucratism during this party rectification, but the leadership has not specifically proposed how to take the mass line to complete the task, many cadres are tied up, especially the district and village cadres are afraid of violating the policy, and there is the idea of "rather low than high, rather less than more," and they have consciously or unconsciously become the tails of the backward masses. Therefore, how to vigorously overcome commandism, while preventing tailism, and use the method of breaking through one point to guide the overall situation, so that cadres learn to take the mass line, is an urgent problem to be solved in the current summer grain collection.

　　各地积极进行夏征工作
    在工作中正努力克服官僚主义命令主义
    尚须纠正麻痹思想并注意防止尾巴主义
    【新华社四日讯】麦收已过，早稻也已登场，各地正积极进行夏季公粮征收工作。
    今年进行夏征的共有十五个省、区和三个市的郊区，即：河北、山西、平原、察哈尔、山东、福建、苏北、皖北（淮河以北部分）、河南、湖北（一部分）、广东、广西、陕西、甘肃、宁夏，以及北京、天津、西安三个市的郊区。同时中央人民政府为照顾农民的生活，使农民能够积累农业资本，今年夏征任务，较一九五零年原概算减轻八亿余斤。
    截至目前止，大部分地区的夏征工作已进入缴粮入仓阶段，也有部分县区已胜利完成征收任务，布置较晚的福建、两广地区，准备在八月初和中旬开征，预计八月底或九月上旬可全部入仓。山西省截至目前为止，已完成一亿二千五百八十七万三千二百五十七斤，达分配额百分之七十六点四七。河北省的赵县，湖北省的浠水、应城、黄陂、沔阳等县在七月初旬即已大体完成入仓任务。
    各地在开始布置夏征工作时，一般都自上而下召开了干部会议，传达夏征政策，并检讨去年秋征中的缺点，要求在这次夏征中努力克服官僚主义和命令主义的作风。大部分的县、区都召开了各界人民代表会议或农民代表会议，讨论夏征政策，分配任务，动员农民群众积极交纳公粮。
    有些地区准备工作做得好，掌握了较准确的材料，征收就比较顺利。如河北赵县，麦征未布置前，该县财政科就重点调查了上、中、下三种产量的典型村，同时各区财政助理员和县府派往各区领导生产的工作组长、都负责勘查了一般村庄的年景产量。此外，人民政府及中共赵县县委又分别召集每区七、八个村的村干部及支部委员的座谈会，了解各村的情况。征收时，干部、党员带头，消除某些群众拖缴、观望的思想。由于事前准备充足，克服强迫命令，深入宣传，该县于七月五日起开征，至十一日即全部完成。山西汾城于夏征开始时即成立各级征粮委员会，加强对征收工作的领导，县长、中共县委书记及其他干部均分赴各区，划分基点，有步骤有计划地贯彻政策，改变了过去工作中干部严重的强迫命令主义作风，群众都自动地在七天内积极缴完了公粮。
    有些地区事前未作好调查工作，布置工作时干部接受不了，说产量定得太高，地亩算得太多，经典型调查后，证明他们自己掌握材料不够，盲目喊任务重。经过突破一点，深入调查，弄清了实际情况之后，干部思想转变了。如河北通县集中力量到六区小街村调查，该村原报麦地五百十二亩，每亩平均产量九十斤小麦，经过深入群众中去宣传解释，使群众了解政策后，逐户登记麦亩为六百二十点八八亩，每亩平均产量九十三斤，原分配任务六千六百八十六斤，经这次调查，按照税率应负担八千三百八十斤，较原定数尚增加百分之二十五强。此外，有些县、区事前既没有认真进行调查研究，征收时又不作典型推动工作，停留在一般地号召、布置、传达。这样空洞地开会号召的结果，工作没有进展。各地经验证明：继续深入发动群众，查清土地产量乃是贯彻政策、完成任务的关键。
    目前干部中存在着两个严重的思想问题：首先是一般干部认为任务较去年轻，产生了麻痹思想，认为完成任务是轻而易举的事情。其次是由于这次整党整风各地都强调纠正命令主义、官僚主义的作风，但领导上没有具体提出如何走群众路线来完成任务，因而形成许多干部束手束脚，尤其是区村干部怕违犯政策，存在着“宁低不高，宁少不多”的思想，有意无意成了落后群众的尾巴。因此，如何大力克服命令主义，同时防止尾巴主义，以突破一点指导全盘的方法，使干部学会走群众路线，是当前夏征中亟需解决的问题。
