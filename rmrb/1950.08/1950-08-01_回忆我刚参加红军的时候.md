　　Recalling When I First Joined the Red Army
    Cao Yuqing
    In March 1929, just after the warlord infighting between Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren had subsided, our platoon of forty-five men, led by a sergeant, broke away from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. We disarmed all the reactionary forces of the Wanzai County government in northwestern Jiangxi, and released the prisoners from the jail. Then we headed to the Soviet area, finding the Red Army at Huangjin Cave in the territory of Pingjiang County, northern Hunan.
    The main force of the Red Army had already been led to Jinggang Mountain by Comrade Peng Dehuai (who was then the army commander). Only about one hundred and fifty to sixty men were left here, led by Comrade Huang Gonglue, and they formed the Second Column of the Red Fifth Army together with the local armed forces. We saw that the houses all over the mountains had been burned by the Kuomintang into broken bricks and tiles, and the people and the army were living in makeshift sheds. In a broken temple that had been burned down to only three rooms, the army and the people gathered to welcome us, and there were also many comfort goods piled up. Commander Huang said, "We are very happy to welcome you. In the past, you were oppressed by the Kuomintang reactionaries to fight. Today, you have broken away from the rule of the reactionaries, joined the people's army, and increased the revolutionary strength."
    At that time, in order to take care of us, each person was given thirty silver dollars and also comfort goods. The army and the people gave us their houses to live in. We really felt the glory of joining the people's army and the enthusiasm of the revolutionary comrades, and we were determined to wipe out the Kuomintang reactionaries who burned and looted the people. Everyone proposed: "Resolutely carry out orders and await reorganization!"
    At the reorganization meeting, Commander Huang reported, "Today we have increased new strength, and the team has expanded; now we are expanding to nine companies, and in the future, we will form dozens of companies, even several armies, dozens of armies. Now we are in the high mountains, and the houses have been burned by the enemy and there is no place to live. In the future, we will go to the plains and cities, where there are big houses everywhere. The whole country belongs to our people, and we will all go..." Commander Huang has already sacrificed for the people. But after more than twenty years of struggle, today, in the victorious situation across the country, reminiscing about what he said, how powerful it is! After the reorganization, our strength expanded. Under the personal command of Commander Huang, together with the local armed forces, after three hours of fighting, we took down Baisha Town, the reactionary den that had been the most devastating to the people in the Soviet area. This victory shook the enemy's headquarters. The enemy concentrated several regiments of troops and invaded our Soviet area. According to the situation at the time, we dispersed into dozens of routes and went to the enemy's rear to operate. Day became night, and we moved at night. After more than two months of maneuvering, the enemy was helpless and had to withdraw. After our victory in this arduous anti-"encirclement and suppression" struggle, the various armies gathered again at Huangmao, at the junction of Tonggu and Wanzai. The reactionaries boasted that Huangmao was an "iron cabinet" that could not be broken, but we and the local Red Guards took it down in one day of fighting with earthen cannons, wiping out all the enemies.
    In this battle, I was wounded. At that time, the troops did not have hospitals, so the wounded were dispersed in the homes of the people for recuperation. The enemy often came to clear the countryside. The lightly wounded ran with the people, and the seriously wounded, the people prepared dry food and carried them up the mountain to hide. Since the birth of our Red Army, it has been closely united with the people, becoming an invincible force, so that it has been able to achieve today's victory.

　　回忆我刚参加红军的时候
    曹玉清
    一九二九年三月，蒋（介石）、李（宗仁）军阀混战刚停下来，我们一排四十五个人，在上士发起下，脱离国民党反动统治，将赣西北的万载县县府反动武装全部缴械，释放了监狱里的犯人。然后投奔苏区，在湘北平江县境黄金洞找到了红军。
    红军主力已由彭德怀同志（当时任军长）带上井岗山，这里只留下一百五六十人，由黄公略同志领导，和地方武装组成红五军二纵队。我们看到遍山的房子被国民党烧得破砖烂瓦，老百姓、军队都住在现搭的草棚里。在一个烧剩下三间的破大庙里，集合着欢迎我们的军队和老百姓，还堆着不少慰劳品。黄司令员讲话说：“我们非常高兴地欢迎你们来到，你们过去受着国民党反动派的压迫去打仗，今天脱离了反动派的统治，参加了人民军队，增加了革命力量。”
    当时为了照顾我们，每人发了三十块白洋，还有慰劳品。军队、老百姓把房子都让给我们住，我们真感到参加人民军队的光荣，和革命同志的热情，决心把烧、抢老百姓的国民党反动派消灭光。大家提出：“坚决执行命令，听候整编！”
    整编的大会上，黄司令员报告说：“我们今天增加了新的力量，队伍扩大啦；现在扩编九个中队，将来要编几十个中队，甚至几个军，几十个军。现在我们在高山上，房子被敌人烧了没处住，将来我们要到平原城市去，有的是大房子，全国都是我们人民的，我们都要去……。”黄司令员已经为人民牺牲了。但是经过二十多年的斗争，今天，在全国胜利的局面下，回味着他说的这句话，是多么有力量呵！整编后，我们的力量扩大了，配合了地方武装，在黄司令员亲身指挥下，经过三个小时的战斗，打下对苏区人民摧残最厉害的反动窠子白沙镇。这个胜利震动了敌人大本营。敌人集中几个团的兵力，向我苏区进犯。根据当时情况，我们就分散数十路，兜到敌后去活动。白天成了黑夜，入夜我们就行动，两个多月的周旋，敌人束手无策，只好收兵回营。我们在这次艰苦的反“清剿”斗争胜利后，各路大军又集合在铜鼓、万载交界的黄茅。反动派吹嘘黄茅为攻打不破的“铁柜子”，被我们和地方赤卫队用土炮在一天的战斗里拿下来了，消灭了全部敌人。
    在这次战斗中，我负了伤。那会儿部队没有医院，就把伤员分散在老百姓家里疗养。敌人经常来清乡，轻伤员和老百姓在一起跑，重伤员，老百姓准备好干粮，抬到山上藏起来。我们红军诞生以来就和人民紧紧结合在一起，成了不可战胜的力量，所以才能取得了今天的胜利。
