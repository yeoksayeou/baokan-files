　　Speech by Beijing Mayor
    Nie Rongzhen at the Opening Ceremony
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] Beijing Mayor Nie Rongzhen delivered the opening address at the Beijing Municipal All-Circles Celebration of the August 1st Army Day and Demonstration Against U.S. Aggression in Taiwan and Korea. The full text is as follows: Fellow compatriots from all walks of life! Comrades!

    Today is the great festival of the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. This people's army, led by the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong, has been engaged in arduous battles with powerful enemies at home and abroad since the August 1st Nanchang Uprising in 1927, through the Ten-Year Agrarian Revolutionary War, the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan, and the Four-Year War of Liberation. In the tempering of this long revolutionary war, it has grown, strengthened, and become an invincible force!

    In the recent Four-Year War of Liberation, we defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries aided by U.S. imperialism. According to four-year statistics, our army eliminated 8,071,350 enemy troops. Our heroic People's Liberation Army is dedicating such great achievements to the people of the whole country, and to this year's August 1st Army Day. We have not only completely eliminated the enemy on the Chinese mainland, but will continue to liberate Taiwan and liberate Tibet. We not only have a powerful People's Army, but also have the People's Air Force, the People's Navy, and other various arms of the services. We have not only achieved the victory of the revolution, but also are able to consolidate the victory of the revolution and defeat the invaders.

    Our great victory is not accidental. This is because we are the people's army. We come from the people, rely on the people, and are for the people. This gives our army's strength an inexhaustible source, making it an eternally victorious army. The reason why we are victorious is because we are an army led and commanded by the great leader of the Chinese people and the great military strategist Mao Zedong. In the practice of the Chinese people's revolutionary war, Comrade Mao Zedong correctly applied and developed the military theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and armed our army with his brilliant strategic thinking, giving us strategic tactics suitable for the characteristics of the Chinese revolution. This is the guarantee of our revolutionary war's victory.

    Compatriots! Comrades! Today, as we celebrate Army Day and the victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war, we must pay attention to the fact that U.S. imperialism has already announced its aggression against Taiwan. This act of aggression, violating our country's territorial sovereignty, is something that our entire nation must resolutely oppose! U.S. imperialism has launched a large-scale offensive against Korea and openly interfered in the national liberation struggles of Vietnam and the Philippines. This act of aggression, which undermines peace in the Far East, is also something that our entire nation must resolutely oppose! The barbarous acts of aggression of U.S. imperialism cannot intimidate us. We will definitely liberate Taiwan! U.S. imperialism also cannot intimidate the Korean people, and has already been beaten to a pulp by the Korean people. We would like to pay our respects to the heroic Korean soldiers and civilians! The world peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has become unprecedentedly strong. U.S. imperialism, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, is bound to fail! The experience of China's 23-year revolutionary war has already proven this truth, and the victories currently being achieved by the Korean people are continuing to prove this truth.

    The people of the whole country, unite and liberate Taiwan! Liberate Tibet! In order to finally complete the war of liberation, defend the fruits of revolutionary victory, and defend world peace, we should consolidate our people's armed forces a hundredfold. We should further build the Chinese People's Liberation Army into a powerful and modern national defense force. We should regard defending the motherland as the sacred duty of every individual. If imperialism dares to attack us, we will make it die!

    Long live the great victory of the Chinese people's revolutionary war!
    Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
    Salute to all the officers and men of the People's Liberation Army!
    Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the people's revolutionary war!
    Salute to the heroic Korean People's Army!
    Salute to the great Soviet Army!
    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao!
    Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!
    Long live General Kim Il-sung, commander of the Korean People's Army!
    Long live Marshal Stalin, the leader of the world peace camp!

    聂荣臻致开会词
    【新华社一日讯】北京市市长聂荣臻在北京各界庆祝八一建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上致开会词，全文如下：各界同胞们！全体同志们！
    今天是中国人民解放军建军二十三周年的伟大节日。中国共产党和毛泽东同志所领导的这一支人民的军队，从一九二七年八一南昌起义以来，经过十年土地革命战争，八年抗日战争和四年的解放战争，一直和国内外强大的敌人进行着艰苦的战斗。在这个长期的革命战争的锻炼中，生长了，壮大了，变成了百战百胜的力量！
    在最近四年的解放战争中，我们打倒了美帝国主义所援助的国民党反动派。根据四年的统计，我军消灭了敌军八百零七万一千三百五十人。我们英勇的人民解放军就是以这样伟大的战绩，献给全国人民，献给今年的八一节。我们不但已经在中国大陆上完全消灭了敌人，而且将继续解放台湾，解放西藏。我们不仅有了强大的人民陆军，并且有了人民的空军，人民的海军和其他各兵种部队。我们不仅已经取得革命的胜利，而且能够巩固革命的胜利，击退侵略者。
    我们的伟大胜利，不是偶然的。这是因为我们是人民的军队。我们是来自人民、依靠人民、为着人民的，这就使我们的军队的力量获得永不枯竭的泉源，成为永远胜利的军队。我们所以会胜利，因为我们是伟大的中国人民领袖和伟大的军事家毛泽东所领导和统率的军队。毛泽东同志在中国人民革命战争的实践中，正确地运用了和发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的军事学说，用他的天才的战略思想，武装了我们的军队，使我们有了适合于中国革命特点的战略战术。这就是我们革命战争胜利的保证。
    同胞们！同志们！今天我们在庆祝建军节的时候，庆祝中国人民革命战争胜利的时候，必须注意美帝国主义已经宣布了对台湾的侵略，这种侵犯我国领土主权的侵略行为，是我们全国人民所必须坚决反对的！美帝国主义已经发动了对朝鲜的大举进攻，并且公开干涉越南和菲律宾的民族解放斗争，这种破坏远东和平的侵略行为，也是我们全国人民所必须坚决反对的！美帝国主义的野蛮的侵略行为，吓不倒我们。我们一定要解放台湾！美帝国主义也吓不倒朝鲜人民，并且已经被朝鲜人民打得落花流水。我们要向英勇的朝鲜军民致敬！以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营已经空前壮大，外强中干的美帝国主义，是一定要失败的！中国二十三年革命战争的经验，已经证明了这个真理，现在朝鲜人民所取得的胜利，正继续证明着这个真理。
    全国人民团结起来，解放台湾！解放西藏！为了最后完成解放战争，保卫革命胜利果实，保卫世界和平，我们应当百倍地巩固我们人民的武装力量，我们应当把中国人民解放军进一步建设成为强大的近代化的国防军，我们应当把捍卫祖国看成每一个人的神圣义务。帝国主义倘若敢向我们进攻，我们就要它死亡！
    中国人民革命战争伟大胜利万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    向人民解放军全体将士致敬！
    在人民革命战争中牺牲的烈士永垂不朽！
    向英勇的朝鲜人民军致敬！
    向伟大的苏军致敬！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    朝鲜人民军的统帅金日成将军万岁！
    世界和平阵营的领袖斯大林大元帅万岁！
