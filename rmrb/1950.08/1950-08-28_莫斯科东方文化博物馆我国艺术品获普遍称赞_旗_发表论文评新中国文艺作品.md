　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 26th: According to a TASS report from Moscow, the Moscow Museum of Oriental Culture has recently opened a special section dedicated to exhibiting Chinese artworks. Several large halls in this section display ancient Chinese paintings, sculptures, embroideries, pottery, and porcelain. There are also bronzes from the first and second centuries BC, ancient coins, tortoiseshell ornaments, and stone sculptures of figures and animals, illustrating the high level of development of ancient Chinese culture. The exhibits also include ivory and gemstone products and porcelain made by Chinese folk artists.

　　Many paintings and propaganda posters by contemporary Chinese artists are also on display. These works truthfully reflect the heroic liberation struggles and constructive labor undertaken by the Chinese people, as well as the social reforms in democratic China. The works of painters such as Zhang Ding and An Lin are extremely popular. The exquisite portraits of Stalin and Mao Zedong embroidered by female textile workers in Shanghai are especially admired.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 27th: According to a TASS report from Moscow on August 24th, the latest issue of the Soviet literary magazine "Flag" published an article by the famous Soviet sinologist, Edling, entitled "Portraits of the Builders of Democratic China," reviewing several works in modern Chinese literature.

　　The article pointed out that the literature of New China is developing under the influence of closer unity between writers and the people, and closer ties between the progressive intellectuals and the working class in free China. Chinese literary magazines frequently publish novels with industrial themes that have ideological and artistic value. These novels familiarize us with the revolutionary struggles of Chinese workers and their joyful and creative labor. The writers of New China describe the edification of people in new social qualities, their struggle against the ideological poison of the old society, and the new people and new characters gradually formed in the struggle. These works describing the working class have already demonstrated the high ideological content of progressive Chinese literature, showing its outstanding efforts to actively participate in the construction of New Democracy and faithfully represent real life.

　　莫斯科东方文化博物馆我国艺术品获普遍称赞
    “旗”发表论文评新中国文艺作品
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科东方文化博物馆最近特辟一部，专门陈列中国的艺术品。该部的若干大厅内陈列着中国古代的绘画、雕刻、刺绣、陶器和瓷器等。并有纪元前第一、二世纪的铜器、古钱、玳瑁装饰品，石刻的人像与动物等，说明中国古代文化发展的高度水平。陈列品中也有中国民间艺术家的象牙、宝石制品和瓷器。
    许多中国当代艺术家的绘画与宣传画也被陈列着。这些作品真实地反映了中国人民所进行的英勇的解放斗争和建设性劳动，以及民主中国的社会改革的情形。画家张仃及安林等人的作品，极受欢迎。上海纺织女工们所绣制的精美的斯大林像和毛泽东像，尤其博得普遍的赞赏。
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十四日讯：最近一期苏联文艺杂志“旗”上面发表了苏联著名汉学家爱德灵所撰题为“民主中国建造者的画像”的论文，评论了现代中国文学中的若干作品。
    该文指出：新中国的文学正在作家与人民更紧密的团结、在自由中国的进步知识阶层与工人阶级更紧密的联系的影响下发展着。中国的文艺杂志中经常刊载有思想价值和艺术价值的以工业为主题的小说。这些小说使我们熟悉中国工人们的革命斗争，熟悉他们的愉快和创造性的劳动。新中国的作家描述了人们在新的社会品质中所受到的薰陶、他们对旧社会的思想毒害所进行的斗争以及在斗争中逐渐形成的新的人和新的性格。这些描述工人阶级的作品已经说明了进步中国文学的高度思想内容，显示了它积极参加新民主主义建设和忠实地表现现实生活的卓越的努力。
