　　Pingyuan Province Agriculture Department
    Suffers Losses from Blind Recruitment
    Comrade Zhao Zhongming Criticizes in Letter
    On July 23rd, the Commissioner's Office received a telegram from the Pingyuan Provincial Government, instructing us to "recruit 200 workers to work at the Bo'ai Farm for a period of three months, with a daily allowance of seven 'jin' of rice per person (the type of rice was not specified)." We immediately arranged the work that day, planning to recruit in the disaster area of ​​Shouzhang. However, the telegram did not clearly indicate issues such as travel expenses, the duration of recruitment, and the supply of leading cadres.
    We wrote several letters to the Provincial Labor Bureau for instructions (at the time, we believed that the recruitment work was arranged by them. According to the person in charge of the Labor Bureau, this work was under the leadership of the Agriculture Department, and they had forwarded our letters of request to the Agriculture Department), but it was not until the 8th that a telegram to stop recruitment was sent. By this time, Shouzhang had recruited 120 workers, scheduled to gather on the 9th and be sent to Xinxiang on the 10th. Some districts had already gathered fifty or sixty people. We immediately explained to the workers and mobilized them to return home. However, the workers discussed it and said, "The government is not serious..." which had a very bad impact. At the same time, the arrived transport vehicles also demanded compensation for losses. Obviously, this is the result of the Agriculture Department's unplanned work. Therefore, I have the following points of opinion, hoping that the Agriculture Department will publicly respond in the newspaper.
    1. Why did the first telegram fail to specifically indicate issues such as the duration of recruitment, treatment, and travel expenses? After receiving the requests from the lower levels, why did you not promptly reply, causing the lower levels to have no basis to follow?
    2. If the Bo'ai project was completed long ago and no longer needed workers, why did you not inform us to stop recruitment earlier?
    3. The losses incurred due to recruitment (round-trip losses of vehicles from Liaocheng to Shouzhang, workers' living expenses, etc.) should be compensated by the Provincial Agriculture Department.

### 平原省农业厅  盲目招工受到损失  赵仲鸣同志来信批评

　　平原省农业厅
    盲目招工受到损失
    赵仲鸣同志来信批评
    七月二十三号，专署接到平原省府电报通知，要我们“招收工人二百名，赴博爱农场工作。时间为三个月，待遇每人每天七斤米（未说明什么米）。”我们即于当日布置工作，拟在寿张灾区进行招收。但这个电报上对于路费、招工期限，及带领干部之供给等问题均没有明确指示。
    我们曾几次写信向省劳动局请示（当时我们认为招工工作是由他们布置的。后据劳动局负责人谈，这个工作系由农业厅领导，并说已将我们的请示信转给农业厅了），但直至八号才发来停止招工的电报，此时寿张已招到工人一百二十人，定九号集合，十号送新乡。有的区里已集合五、六十人。我们即向工人进行解释，动员回家。但工人议论纷纷地说：“政府没真事……”影响极坏。同时已到之运输汽车，亦要求赔偿损失。显然地，这是农业厅办事无计划的结果。因此，我有以下几点意见，希望农业厅在报纸上公开答复。
    一、第一次电示为何未将招工期限、待遇、路费等问题具体指示？接到下级请示信后，又为什么不及时批复，致使下级无从遵循？
    二、如博爱工程早已完毕，不再需要工人，为何不早些电告停止招工？
    三、此次因招工而受到的损失（汽车由聊城到寿张往返损失、工人生活费等），应由省农业厅负责偿还。
