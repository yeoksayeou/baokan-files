　　One Side is Brutal, Cowardly Savages
　　One Side is Glorious, Heroic People
　　An Eyewitness Account of the Newly Liberated Areas of South Korea
　　By Our Special Correspondent in the Korean War Zone, Li Zhuang

　　In early August, I traveled 1,500 li in the newly liberated areas of the southern half of the Korean Republic. I personally witnessed the bloody atrocities of the American aggressor troops and the Li Seung-man bandit gang, and I also personally witnessed the heroic resistance of the Korean people. Countless peaceful Korean villages were destroyed by the American planes' incendiary bombs. Countless peaceful Korean residents were killed by the enemy's machine guns and bayonets. This irreconcilable blood feud aroused universal indignation among the Korean people. They heroically resisted, advanced rapidly, and have already won glorious victories. I also shared the joy of victory.

　　Crossing the Han River at Night

　　We departed from Seoul at night, originally planning to cross the Han River via the Han River Bridge. However, because enemy planes had dropped time bombs on the bridge that had not yet fully exploded, we temporarily switched to a ferry. At this time, the moon was as bright as day, and the sky was clear and cloudless. The summer sky in Korea, like the summer sky in North China, is clear, high, and refreshing. The Han River flowed quietly, with gentle breezes and ripples, and the water was silver in color. People waiting to cross the river gathered on the riverbank. Due to the scarcity of boats and the large number of people, many could not cross the river immediately and had to sleep on the damp sand. Babies cried, and mothers made low, cursing sounds.

　　At this moment, American planes came to bomb again. First, they dropped flares, then bombs and rocket-propelled grenades. They aimed at these babies and women, firing for up to twenty minutes. They completely extinguished their humanity, these abominable American savages.

　　Two young sailors ferried us across the Han River. They were members of the Korean Democratic Youth League (referred to as Minqing), and they persisted in their work under enemy bombing, staying up all night. After crossing the Han River, there was a vast sandy beach with no roads. A Minqing member got into our car and drove us for several kilometers. He shook our hands tightly at parting. His back slowly disappeared into the vast moonlight. I was reminded of the peasants of the Taihang Mountains who often led the troops during the guerrilla war, coming excitedly and returning alone.

　　Motorized artillery units and infantry were heading to the front along the road. Countless jeeps and trucks were driving in the opposite direction. The rumbling of engines and the hurried sound of footsteps showed the busyness and tension of the war. The drivers of the cars coming from the opposite direction kept shouting, "Comrades, don't turn on your lights." The advancing troops often blew whistles, telling us to stop and reporting that there was an air raid at this time. A kind of fighting friendship completely united people, caring about the safety of comrades as much as caring about oneself.

　　Patriots of Suwon

　　Suwon is more than a hundred li south of Seoul, and the county seat has more than 60,000 people. Before the liberation of Suwon, the Li Seung-man bandit gang massacred more than a thousand patriots. After the liberation of Suwon, American planes continued to carry out bestial bombings. The moonlight sprinkled on the bombed ruins, making it particularly desolate. However, the people of Suwon never yielded. They worked intensively, supporting the front line day and night. At the same time, they conducted elections for the village people's committees, with participation reaching 99.8 percent of the total number of voters. Various mass organizations were established one after another, with the Minqing having more than 3,000 members, and progressive women joining the Korean Women's Alliance reaching more than 700.

　　I visited the office of the County People's Committee. This was a very large house, each side more than fifty meters long and wide, and there were many staff members inside, the vast majority of whom were young people. Some were writing slogans, some were making phone calls, and some were holding small meetings. The noise revealed tension. The atmosphere was very similar to that of the national salvation groups at the beginning of our War of Resistance Against Japan. The staff were excited and enthusiastic, working tirelessly.

　　According to Park Seung-geuk, the chairman of the Suwon People's Committee, 20 percent of the staff of the People's Committee came from prisons. These comrades saw that the patriotic unification war was about to be completely victorious, and their ideals were about to be realized, so they were working desperately. The remaining 80 percent of the staff were divided into two types: one was revolutionary sympathizers, who were extremely excited in the revolutionary upsurge and worked very vigorously; the other was elements who had worked under the puppet regime but had no major misdeeds, and they were actively working hard to make contributions to the new country, inspired by the lenient policy of the People's Committee.

　　Chairman Park Seung-geuk had been in prison for five years. He came from a middle-peasant family and is now forty-two years old. Because he has worked in rural areas for a long time, he is very cultivated in peasant literature. South of Seoul, many responsible comrades of counties and districts have been imprisoned. They have pale faces, but they have an unusual enthusiasm and vitality. Today, they have become a valuable backbone of the people's power of the Korean Republic, and they are full of confidence in victory.

　　In a Japanese-style house, several revolutionaries who had escaped from the Seodaemun Prison in Seoul excitedly talked about the moving scene when they were liberated. According to them, if Seoul had been liberated one day later, many more revolutionaries trapped in the prison would have sacrificed. Seoul had four major prisons: Seodaemun, Mapo, Yeongdeungpo, and the Army Prison. All the revolutionaries in the Army Prison were killed by the American and Li bandits. At one o'clock on the morning of the 28th, the 163 patriots held in Seodaemun Prison by the Army Prison were transported by the enemy to Xibingku in Seoul and collectively shot. At four o'clock on the morning of the 28th, the "prisoners" suddenly heard the harsh sound of sirens, which was the signal for the bandits to escape. At six o'clock, no guards called the "prisoners" to get up (usually, at six o'clock in the morning, the prison guards would force the "prisoners" to get up). The "prisoners" associated this with the increasingly approaching sound of artillery fire and knew that a major event was about to happen. Therefore, everyone got up automatically, put on their clothes, and waited. At seven o'clock, the roar of engines was thunderous, and the People's Army's heavy tanks crashed open the prison gate. The revolutionaries smashed the small holes in the prison cells. In the huge prison, cheers of "Long Live the Republic" resounded through the sky. The People's Army tank drivers jumped out of the turrets and warmly hugged and shook hands with the revolutionaries. At this time, people didn't know what to say, only felt hot tears streaming down their cheeks. In the unspoken tears of victory, the Korean revolutionaries were liberated. They quickly shaved their beards and changed their clothes, without any rest. Many people didn't even have time to go home and see their families before going to various free and fighting posts. In the newly liberated areas of the southern half of the Republic, you can meet such comrades everywhere.

　　Killing Field

　　We traveled southwest from Suwon at night, with light clouds floating in the sky and the moonlight sometimes bright and sometimes dim. The roads in Korea are wide and flat, with neat rows of roadside trees planted along the roads. The mountains near the roads are lush with vegetation, and ancient pines and walnut trees emit a fragrance. But when walking into the villages, you will always smell the suffocating stench of decaying corpses and the smell of burnt wood. None of the villages along the way had escaped American bombing, and some villages had become piles of rubble and needed to be completely rebuilt from scratch. The barbarity of the American savages will make future generations of Koreans never forget.

　　We arrived in Chungju at dawn. Chungju belongs to North Chungcheong Province and is an important transportation hub. Before the Li Seung-man bandit gang fled, they brutally murdered 613 patriots here. The families of the victims went to the execution ground to look for the bodies, but were attacked by the bandit gang's machine guns. These heartless bandits, in order to prevent the families of the victims from finding the bodies of their relatives, slashed the faces of the corpses to pieces with bayonets after the shooting. After the liberation of Chungju, American planes continued to bomb, and 150 peaceful families were completely destroyed by bombs. When the bandit gang fled, they widely propagated that the People's Army was killing people and forced all the residents to flee. As a result, the clothing carried by those heading south was all looted by the bandit army. For those heading north, the bandits believed that they must be going to welcome the People's Army, and they would be shot immediately if discovered.

　　In order to prevent enemy air raids, the Chungju People's Committee dispersed and worked in many small houses in a certain place. During the day, the work was considerably affected, but at night, it was carried out with twice the intensity. According to Kim Hang-bae, the chairman of the People's Committee, the masses' anti-American sentiment is very high. On the night of July 20, the County People's Committee held a celebration meeting for the liberation. In the darkness, more than 10,000 people attended the meeting. The nearby ×× two bridges were destroyed by the enemy, and hundreds of people participated in the repair work every night. Although enemy planes also came at night, their threat was much smaller. Kim Hang-bae had been imprisoned for more than a year. When Seoul was liberated, he came out of Seodaemun Prison and immediately formed a small guerrilla team and went to Chungju.

　　We inspected a killing field five kilometers away from Chungju, led by Kim Chan-chin. Kim Chan-chin was one of the victims at the time. He was shot in the back by the bandit army. The bullet hit his left arm. He fell into the pool of blood of his comrades, and the bandits thought he was dead. After half a day, after the bandits left the execution ground, he woke up and escaped at night. Now, his injury has not yet healed, but he has already joined the work of the People's Committee.

　　Kim Chan-chin is a twenty-six-year-old young man who used to teach at the Shuiyuanbao Village, thirty li east of Chungju. He is a member of the Educators Association. The Educators Association is an underground organization of left-wing teachers, which had widespread activities in the southern half of Korea. Kim said: From June 30, the Li Seung-man bandit gang began to arrest people on a large scale. Revolutionary suspects had already been completely arrested, and those who were arrested now were only possible suspects. Kim was arrested on July 3 and was shot the next day without any interrogation. He said that most of these 613 patriots were intellectuals, and none of them had been subjected to any interrogation.

　　The killing field we inspected was one of the three killing fields in Chungju. One hundred and thirty patriots were killed here. On a hillside four to five hundred meters high, there are pine trees as thick as bowls. Under the pine trees is tall grass that reaches up to the knees. Piles of fresh sand are buried with the martyred patriots, and small wooden signs are inserted into the sand. There are still more than thirty corpses that have not been buried, and these are waiting for the relatives of the deceased to claim them. These corpses are lying horizontally and vertically, their heads are broken, and their hands are still tied with thick iron wires. Among them are two women. Blood dyed the tall grass black, and the stench of corpses filled the air. There are very few shoes on the execution ground, and many of the victims' shoes were stripped off by the bandit army. Kim said: The bandits killed people at 11:00 a.m. on July 4. At that time, traffic was completely cut off. Twenty large trucks pulled the patriots to three places. The bandits held American carbines, rifles, and pistols, standing more than ten meters behind the patriots. Under a unified order, they fired at the same time. For a while, gunshots rang out, and the victims fell one after another.

　　After the shouts of "Long Live the Republic", there was a sound of moaning. The tragedy of the revolutionaries made the brutal bandits tremble with fear.

　　一面是残暴的怯懦的生番
    一面是光荣的英雄的人民
    南朝鲜新解放区目击记
    本报特派朝鲜战地记者  李庄
    八月上旬，我在朝鲜共和国南半部新解放区，旅行了一千五百里。我亲眼看到美国侵略军和李承晚匪帮的血腥暴行，也亲眼看到朝鲜人民的英勇反抗。多少朝鲜的和平村庄，被美国飞机的烧夷弹毁灭了。多少朝鲜的和平居民，被敌人的机枪和刺刀杀死了。这种不共戴天的血海深仇，激起朝鲜人民普遍的激愤。他们英勇地反抗，神速地进军，他们已获得了光辉的胜利，我也同尝了胜利的欢欣。
  夜渡汉江
    夜间从汉城出发，原拟从汉江桥上渡汉江，因为敌机在桥上投下定时炸弹，还未完全爆炸，临时改乘渡船。这时月明如昼，晴空万里。朝鲜夏季的天空，和华北夏季的天空一样，清高而爽朗。汉江静静地流着，微风细浪，水色如银。河滩上聚集着等待渡河的人们，由于船少人多，许多人一时不能渡河，只得睡在潮湿的砂地上。婴儿哭着，母亲们发出低微的诅咒的声音。
    这时候，美国飞机又来轰炸了。先投下照明弹，接着投下炸弹和火箭炮弹。他们对准这些婴儿和妇女射击，先后达二十分钟。它们完全灭绝了人性，这些可恶的美国生番。
    两个年轻的水手把我们渡过汉江。他们是朝鲜民主主义青年同盟的盟员（简称民青），在敌机轰炸下坚持工作，终夜不眠。过了汉江，是一片没有路的广阔的砂滩。一个民青坐上我们的车子，一直送了几公里。临别时紧紧地握了手。他的背影，慢慢消失在苍茫的月色中。我想起在游击战争时期，经常为部队引路的太行山的农民，他们兴奋而来，单独回去那种情景。
    沿路有摩托化炮队和步兵开往前方。对面有无数吉普和卡车驶来。隆隆的马达和急匆的脚步声，显示出战争的忙碌和紧张。对面驶来的汽车司机不断喊着：“同志们，不要开灯。”前行的部队常常吹起哨子，叫我们停车，报告这时有空袭。一种战斗的友谊，把人们完全团结在一起，关心同志的安全，就和关心自己一样。
  水原的爱国者
    水原在汉城以南百余里，县城中有六万余人。水原解放前，李承晚匪帮曾残杀爱国者千余人，水原解放后，美国飞机又连续进行兽性的轰炸。月光洒在被炸后的断瓦残垣上，分外凄怆。但是，水原人民绝未屈服，他们紧张地工作，不分昼夜地支援前线。同时进行了乡村人民委员会的选举，参加选举者竟达选民总数的百分之九十九点八。各种群众组织相继建立，民青已有三千余人，参加朝鲜女性同盟的进步妇女，已达七百多人。
    我参观了县人民委员会的办公室。这是一个很大的房子，长宽各有五十余米，房内的工作人员很多，青年占绝大多数。写标语的，打电话的，开小会的，都有。嘈杂中透着紧张。那种气氛，很像我国抗日战争开始时的救亡团体。工作人员兴奋热烈，废寝忘食。
    据水原人民委员会委员长朴胜极说，人民委员会工作人员的百分之二十，是从监狱出来的。这些同志看见爱国统一战争即将完全胜利，他们的理想就要实现了，所以都在拚命的工作。其余百分之八十的工作人员，又分为两种：一是革命同情者，他们在革命高潮中，异常兴奋，工作很起劲。一是曾在傀儡政权下作事，但是没有重大劣迹的分子，他们身受人民委员会宽大政策的感召，也积极努力，以求为新国家立功。
    朴胜极委员长住过五年监狱。他出身于一个中农家庭，现年四十二岁，由于长期在农村工作，对农民文学很有修养。在汉城以南，许多县、区的负责同志都受过监禁，他们面色苍白，但有一种异乎寻常的热情和活力。今天，他们成了朝鲜共和国人民政权的宝贵的骨干，他们充满了胜利的信心。
    在一所日本式的洋房中，几位从汉城西大门监狱中脱险的革命者，兴奋地谈论着他们获得解放时的动人的情景。据他们说，如果汉城晚解放一天，被困在监狱中的革命者，不知要多牺牲多少人。汉城共有西大门、麻浦、永登浦、陆军四大监狱，陆军监狱中的革命者，全部被美李匪帮杀害了。二十八日晨一时，陆军监狱寄押在西大门监狱中的一百六十三个爱国者，又被敌人运到汉城西冰库，集体枪杀了。二十八日晨四时，“囚犯”们突闻刺耳的警笛声，这是匪帮逃跑的信号。六时，仍无看守叫“囚犯”起床（在往常，早晨六时，监狱的看守就要逼着“囚犯”起床了）。“囚犯”们联系着想到那日益逼近的炮声，知道大的事变要发生了。因此，大家自动起床，披衣等待。七时，马达吼声如雷，人民军的重型坦克撞开监狱的大门，革命者群起捣碎囚房的小洞。巨大的监狱中，顿时响起冲天的“共和国万岁”的欢呼声。人民军的坦克手从炮塔中跳出来，和革命者亲热地拥抱、握手。这时人们都不晓得应该说些什么，只觉得热泪沿两颊簌簌而下。在胜利的无言的泪光中，朝鲜的革命者获得解放了，他们迅速地刮了胡子换好衣裳，完全没有休息，许多人甚至来不及回家看看，就分别走上各种自由的战斗的岗位。在共和国南半部新解放区，到处都可以遇到这样的同志。
    杀人场
    从水原乘夜西南行，天空浮着朵朵淡云，月色时明时晦。朝鲜的公路宽阔平坦，路旁种着整整齐齐的行道树。公路近旁的山上，草木茂盛，古松和胡桃树，发出一派清香。但在走进村庄的时候，总会嗅到窒息的腐尸臭味和焦木气息。沿途村庄，竟没有一个未受美国飞机轰炸的，有些村庄已成一片瓦砾，需要完全从头建起。美国生番的残暴，将使朝鲜的后代儿孙，永生永世都不能忘记。
    黎明到忠州。忠州属忠清北道，为一交通要冲。李承晚匪帮逃窜前，曾在此惨杀爱国者六百一十三人。被害者的家属到尸场寻尸，又遭到匪帮机枪的射击。这些毫无心肝的匪徒，他们为了不让被害者的家属找到亲人的尸体，竟在枪杀以后，用刺刀把尸体的面部划得稀烂。忠州解放后，美国飞机又不断轰炸，一百五十个和平的家庭，被炸弹完全毁灭了。匪帮逃窜时，大肆宣传人民军杀人，强迫居民全部出走。结果，南行者携带的衣物，都被匪军抢光了。对于北行者，匪徒认为一定是去欢迎人民军，只要发现立即射杀。
    为了防止敌机的袭击，忠州人民委员会疏散在某地许多小屋里办公。在白天，工作受到相当的影响，但在夜间，却加倍紧张地进行着。据人民委员会委员长金恒培说，群众抗美的情绪是很高的。七月二十日夜，县人民委员会召开庆祝解放大会，在黑暗中，到会者达万余人。附近××两桥被敌炸毁，每夜都有几百人参加修复工作。虽然夜间敌机也来，但其威胁力量是小多了。金恒培被监禁过一年多，汉城解放时他从西大门监狱出来，立即组成一个小游击队，到了忠州。
    我们视察离忠州五公里的一个杀人场，由金赞钦领着。金赞钦是当时的被难者之一，他被匪军从背后打了一枪。弹中左臂。他倒在同志们的血泊中，匪徒们以为他死了。过了半日，匪徒离开刑场以后，他苏醒过来，乘夜间逃走。现在，他的伤还没有好，已经参加了人民委员会的工作。
    金赞钦是个二十六岁的青年，原在忠州东三十里的水原堡村教书，是教育者协会的会员。教育者协会是一个左翼教员的地下组织，在朝鲜南半部曾有广泛的活动。金说：从六月三十日起，李承晚匪帮开始大规模捕人。革命嫌疑者早已完全被捕，现在被捕的，只是可能的嫌疑者了。金在七月三日被捕，根本未经审问，第二天即被枪杀。他说，这六百一十三个爱国者，大部是知识分子，都是没有经过任何审问的。
    我们视察的这个杀人场，是忠州三个杀人场之一，在此处被害的爱国者有一百三十人。在一个四、五百公尺高的山坡上。长满碗口粗的松树。松树下是深及膝上的高草。一堆一堆的新鲜砂土，埋着被害的志士，砂土上插着小小的木牌子。还有三十多具尸体没有掩埋，这是等着尸亲来认领的。这些尸体横躺竖卧，头颅均被击碎，两手还用粗铁丝绑着，其中有两个妇女。血把高草染成黑色，尸臭冲天。尸场上鞋子很少，许多被害者的鞋都被匪军扒去了。金说：匪徒们在七月四日上午十一时杀人，当时交通完全断绝，二十部大卡车，把爱国者拉到三个地方，匪徒们拿着美国的卡宾枪，步枪和手枪，站在爱国者背后十几米的地方，在统一的号令下，同时射击，一时枪声大作，被害者纷纷倒地。
    在“共和国万岁”的呼声之后，接着是一片呻吟的声音。革命者的悲壮，使残忍的匪徒们为之胆寒。
      （未完待续）
