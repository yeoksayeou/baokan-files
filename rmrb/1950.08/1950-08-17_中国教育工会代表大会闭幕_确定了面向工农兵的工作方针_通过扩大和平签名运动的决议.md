　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The First National Congress of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union concluded on the 11th. Three hundred and twenty-nine delegates attended the conference. Except for representatives from Taiwan, Tibet, and the newly liberated Hainan Island, which are yet to be liberated, representatives from every other province and region attended, including educators from universities, middle schools, primary schools, social education, educational administration, ethnic minorities, and overseas Chinese, demonstrating the unprecedented great unity of Chinese educational workers. The congress elected the leading body of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union - the National Committee, with Wu Yuzhang and 65 others (including one reserved each for Taiwan and Tibet) as formal members, and Sheng Jin and 17 others (including one reserved for Hainan Island) as alternate members (see today's edition of this newspaper, page 2, for the list - editor). The congress unanimously agreed to nominate the representative attending the Fifth Congress of the International Federation of Teachers' Unions as a candidate for Vice-Chairman of the International Federation of Teachers' Unions.

　　The congress determined that the working guidelines of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union are: educational workers should face the workers, peasants and soldiers; school education should open its doors to workers and peasants.

　　In addition, the congress discussed the living conditions of the majority of the 700,000 educational workers - primary school teachers, especially rural primary school teachers, and suggested that the central Ministry of Education approve the implementation of publicly run and privately assisted schools in rural areas, and appropriately charge tuition fees.

　　The congress unanimously passed the "Resolution on Expanding the Peace Signature Campaign." The congress decided to make the peace signature campaign one of the central tasks of the Educational Workers' Union in the recent period, striving for each educational worker to mobilize one hundred people to sign the peace declaration, and to make educational workers across the country organizers and propagandists of the peace signature campaign.

　　The congress unanimously passed congratulatory telegrams to Chairman Mao, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and telegrams of condolence and respect to educational workers who persisted in the educational front in disaster areas and overseas Chinese educational workers.

　　Finally, Chairman Wu Yuzhang of the presidium delivered the closing speech, pointing out that the most important thing for educational workers in the future is to unite and follow the mass line; secondly, to study Mao Zedong Thought; and thirdly, the trade union should earnestly seek welfare for its members.
