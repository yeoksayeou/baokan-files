　　People's Bank of China Shijiazhuang Office
    Deeply Investigates Loan Work
    Blind Loan Phenomenon Still Needs Vigorous Correction
    [Our Newspaper Shijiazhuang News] The People's Bank of China's Shijiazhuang Office, in order to further implement the resolutions of the Fourth People's Representative Conference of Shijiazhuang, adjust the relationship between public and private sectors and between industry and commerce, and implement the policy of considering both public and private interests, conducted an inspection of loan work from July 25th to 31st.
    Since the stabilization of prices and the commencement of loans, the bank has issued 4.346 billion yuan in private loans from May to the end of July alone. Nearly a thousand private industrial and commercial enterprises in Shijiazhuang have received support, promoting the restoration and development of production. In July, it also made 2.1 billion yuan in exchange settlements, with private enterprises accounting for over 82%. This not only facilitated the transportation and sale of goods and the procurement of raw materials for private industrial and commercial enterprises but also reduced the burden of interest. It also supported exports and promoted the circulation of Renminbi in rural areas. However, due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of the situation when issuing loans and the incomplete implementation of the "three checks" system (pre-loan investigation, during-loan review, and post-loan inspection), there were instances of blind lending. Moreover, in the process of issuance, instructions were often mechanically implemented, and deviations occurred due to a lack of study of the spirit of the instructions. For example, at the beginning of the issuance, the office pointed out that certain relatively good regular deposit customers, even if they were not the target of support, could be given short-term loan considerations if necessary. However, the implementation below became generalized and did not distinguish specific objects, resulting in situations such as the fourth branch office lending four times to the cigarette vendor Jiang Xiaoyan (1 million yuan each time). Jiang himself only used it once, and the remaining three times were lent to others because they were not needed. Sometimes, for current account holders, unprincipled accommodation was made simply to win them over. For example, a grocery store borrowed 4 million yuan from the fourth branch office to buy paper money and tin foil (the stated purpose at the time of the loan was not this), and later requested another loan. The branch office, because the store did not keep its word, advocated that it should not be lent again, but the store said: "If you don't lend, I will close my account and open an account at the first branch office." To avoid losing the account, the fourth branch office decided to lend another 5 million yuan. In addition, insufficient communication between the branch offices, resulting in insufficient knowledge of the situation, was also a reason for blind lending.
    In order to correct the above deviations, the office convened an office meeting on August 2nd. At this meeting, in addition to the profound self-criticism made by each branch office, it was pointed out that the above deviations not only wasted state funds, harmed the public and were unfavorable to private interests, but also easily fostered the speculative nature of industrial and commercial enterprises. In the future, in addition to vigorously correcting this, it will further clarify the basic spirit of adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors, strictly implement the "three checks" system, overcome the purely task-oriented viewpoint, and strengthen the policy education of considering both public and private interests, so that the future lending work will have a new transformation.

### 人民银行石家庄办事处  深入检查贷款工作  盲目贷款现象尚须大力纠正

　　人民银行石家庄办事处
    深入检查贷款工作
    盲目贷款现象尚须大力纠正
    【本报石家庄讯】人民银行石家庄办事处为进一步贯彻石市四次人民代表会议决议，调整公私、工商关系，贯彻公私兼顾政策，曾于七月二十五日至三十一日开始检查了贷款工作。
    该行自物价稳定、开始贷款以来，仅自五月至七月底，即发放私营贷款四十三亿四千六百万元，石市将近千户的私营工商业都受到了扶植，促进了生产的恢复与发展。七月份并作押汇二十一亿元，其中私营占百分之八十二以上，不但便利了私营工商业的货物运销及原料采购，而且减轻了利息负担。同时也扶植了出口，推进了人民币下乡。但由于在发放贷款时，缺乏全面情况的掌握，对三查制度（即贷前调查，贷时审查、贷后检查）执行不彻底，因此有盲目贷放的现象。且在发放时，往往机械执行指示条文，不研究指示精神而发生偏差。如开始发放时，办事处曾指出：对某些较好的经常存款户，虽不是扶植对象，必要情况下，亦可予以短期贷款照顾。而下面执行起来，就成了一般化的不分具体对象，以致发生如四分理处对烟贩江晓沿四次贷款（每次一百万元），江本人只用一次，其余三次皆因不需要而转借给了他人。对往来户，有时也为了单纯争取而无原则的迁就。如一杂货店，在四分理处贷款四百万元买了烧纸、锡箔（贷时所说用途并非如此），后又要求贷款，该处因该号不守信用，主张不再贷给，但该号说：“若不贷即销户，我到一分理处去开户。”四分理处为了怕销户，又决定再贷给五百万元。此外，各分理处之间联系不够密切，致掌握情况不够，也是造成盲目贷放的原因。
    该办事处为纠正上述偏向，曾于八月二日召开了处务会议。在这次会议上，除各分理处作了深刻检讨外，并指出：以上偏向的发生不仅浪费国家资金，损公又不利私，且易助长工商业户的投机性。今后决定除大力纠正外，将进一步明确调整公私关系的基本精神，严格执行三查制度，克服单纯任务观点，加强公私兼顾的政策教育，以便今后的放款工作有一个新的转变。
