Speech by Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions at the Beijing Celebration of "August 1st" Army Day and Demonstration Against US Aggression in Taiwan and Korea:

The Chinese working class and the laboring people of the whole country, with boundless excitement, celebrate our "August 1st" Army Day, and sincerely extend our lofty respects to Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all its commanders and fighters!

For twenty-three years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wholeheartedly for the motherland and the people, with infinite heroism, perseverance, and self-sacrifice, has fought hard for a long time, defeated the Japanese fascist aggression, and completely smashed the reactionary rule of US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek on the Chinese mainland. This has enabled our working class and the people of the whole country to gain liberation and freedom, become masters of the country, and unite to strive to build an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous New China. Our People's Liberation Army is already a well-trained, invincible, and all-conquering force. This force will resolutely fight to completely eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits, oppose American aggression, and liberate Taiwan and Tibet. The broad masses of the Chinese working class must cherish our people's army a hundredfold, launch a production competition campaign with high labor enthusiasm, strengthen trade union organizations, overcome all difficulties, strive for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, and actively support the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army.

The American warmongers, cruelly oppressing their own working class at home and invading Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, and the Philippines abroad, have aroused the anger of the people of Asia and the people of the whole world with these unjust and shameless acts and have already been met with a head-on blow by the Korean people. This proves that US imperialism is nothing but a "paper tiger," and the American aggressors can only suffer the fate of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo.

The strength of the Asian people has grown unprecedentedly: The four hundred and seventy-five million people in China have stood up and have their own great leader Chairman Mao and their own powerful, all-conquering People's Liberation Army; the people of Korea and Vietnam, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung and President Ho Chi Minh, are victoriously advancing to fight against the invaders. The world's peace and democracy camp, under the leadership of the world's peace fortress—the Soviet Union—and the leader of the world's people—Stalin—is fighting for world peace and democracy. Victory will surely belong to the people of the world.

As we celebrate "August 1st" Army Day, our working class throughout the country must resolutely guarantee to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: We will support the People's Liberation Army in quickly planting our five-star red flag in Tibet and Taiwan with practical actions to complete production tasks with high labor enthusiasm.

    刘宁一的演说
    【新华社一日讯】中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的演说：
    中国工人阶级和全国的劳动人民，以无限的兴奋庆祝我们的“八一”建军节，并诚恳的向中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会毛主席、中国人民解放军朱总司令和全体指战员致以崇高的敬礼！
    中国人民解放军二十三年以来，在中国共产党、毛主席、朱总司令正确领导之下，全心全意为了祖国和人民，以无限的英勇坚毅和自我牺牲的精神，经过长期艰苦斗争，打垮了日本法西斯的侵略，彻底粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石在中国大陆的反动统治。使我们工人阶级和全国人民获得了解放和自由，成为国家的主人，团结一致，为建设一个独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国而奋斗。我们的人民解放军已经是久经锻炼无坚不摧所向皆捷的强大队伍，这支队伍将为彻底消灭蒋匪残余，反对美国侵略，解放台湾西藏而坚决斗争，中国的工人阶级广大群众要百倍的爱护我们人民的军队，以高度的劳动热情展开生产竞赛运动，加强工会组织，克服一切困难，争取财政经济状况的根本好转，积极支援人民解放军的胜利进军。
    美国战争贩子们，对内穷凶极恶的压迫本国工人阶级，对外侵略台湾、朝鲜、越南、菲律宾，这种违背正义的无耻行为，已经激起了亚洲人民和全世界人民的愤怒，已经遭到了朝鲜人民的迎头痛击。这证明了美帝国主义不过是“纸老虎”，美国侵略者只能遭受希特勒、墨索里尼、东条之流的命运。
    亚洲人民的力量已经空前壮大了：在中国四万万七千五百万人民已经站立起来了，并且有了自己的伟大领袖毛主席和自己的强大的百战百胜的人民解放军；朝鲜、越南的人民在金日成将军和胡志明主席领导下，正在为反对侵略者而胜利地进军。全世界的和平民主阵营在全世界和平的堡垒——苏联，和全世界人民的领袖——斯大林领导下，为全世界的和平民主而斗争，胜利是一定属于世界人民的。
    当着我们庆祝“八一”建军节的时候，我们全国工人阶级要向毛主席和朱总司令坚决保证：我们要以高度的劳动热情，完成生产任务的实际行动，支援人民解放军很快地把我们的五星红旗插到西藏和台湾去。
