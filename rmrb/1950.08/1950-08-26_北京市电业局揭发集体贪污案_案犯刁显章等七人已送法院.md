　　Beijing Electric Power Bureau Uncovers Collective Embezzlement Case
    Culprits Diao Xianzhang and Six Others Handed Over to Court
    The Beijing Electric Power Bureau recently uncovered an embezzlement case involving Diao Xianzhang and six others. The facts are as follows:
    Diao Xianzhang, Ren Changyuan, Cai Yunlong, staff members of the Accounting Section, and Sun Shihe, Zhu Lianqi, Sun Shuncheng, and Li Zongting, staff members of the Charging Section, of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau, were all retained personnel. During the period of Japanese occupation, they frequently colluded to engage in embezzlement. After the liberation of Beijing in February 1949, they remained unrepentant, abused their authority to commit illegal acts, and regularly stole and embezzled state property. From March to August 1949, they embezzled a total of 17 times. The amount embezzled, when converted based on electricity prices, totaled over 51,000 kilowatt-hours, equivalent to approximately 51,000 catties of millet.
    The case was exposed by Sun Shihe of the Charging Section, who confessed during his studies at the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class from March to June this year. After a long period of study and transformation since liberation, Sun Shihe's political awareness had increased, and he joined the Communist Youth League. However, he hesitated to expose the case earlier due to personal considerations. After attending the Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class this year, he finally straightened out his thinking and voluntarily confessed that in March of last year, he, along with Diao Xianzhang, Ren Changyuan of the Accounting Section, and Zhu Lianqi and Sun Shuncheng of the Charging Section, collectively embezzled over 80,000 yuan (equivalent to over 5,000 catties of millet at the time), and he personally received 10,000 yuan of the loot. Based on this clue, the responsible comrades of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau spoke with Diao Xianzhang and the other three. From their contradictory statements, they traced the truth of the collective embezzlement: Diao Xianzhang and others in the Accounting Section abused their power to produce receipts, Sun Shuncheng, the steel stamp administrator, privately stamped them, and then the collectors, Li Zongting and others, used deceptive methods to retain the users' receipts. In this way, they embezzled the received electricity fees.
    In order to clarify all the facts, the Beijing Electric Power Bureau has transferred them to the court for handling.
    Currently, all organs under the Central People's Government are carrying out a campaign of streamlining and economizing. However, embezzlement incidents still occur in our state-owned electric power industry, and they are hidden and concealed for more than a year before being confessed by individual awakened elements. This is the result of lax supervision by the leadership. It is hoped that the General Administration of Electric Power Management will conduct education among cadres based on the materials of this collective embezzlement case, launch the masses to make denunciations in accordance with the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's instructions on streamlining and economizing, in order to eliminate extravagance, waste, and corruption in electric power industries across the country.

    Editor's Note: The collective embezzlement case of Diao Xianzhang and others shows that the Beijing Electric Power Bureau has not thoroughly reformed the old system, allowing embezzlers to continue to manufacture false receipts and engage in malfeasance, embezzling over 50,000 catties of millet before and after, without being discovered. This bad result is caused by the serious bureaucracy of the bureau's leadership. Therefore, we hope that the leading comrades of the bureau will conduct a profound self-criticism in this rectification movement, strictly enforce economic procedures, reform the old system, and earnestly educate and transform the retained personnel to improve their political awareness.

### 北京市电业局揭发集体贪污案  案犯刁显章等七人已送法院

　　北京市电业局揭发集体贪污案
    案犯刁显章等七人已送法院
    北京电业局最近揭发了刁显章等七人的贪污案。事实的经过是这样的：
    北京电业局核算股职员刁显章、任长源、蔡云龙及收费股职员孙世贺、朱连启、孙顺城、李宗庭等七人，均为留用人员，在日寇统治时期经常合伙进行贪污。一九四九年二月北京解放后，他们仍不知悔改，利用职权作犯法行为，经常盗用贪污国家财产。自一九四九年三月起至同年八月止，共计贪污十七次。贪污数额如按电价折算，共为五万一千余度，约合小米五万一千余斤。
    该案是由收费股孙世贺于今年三月至六月在中共北京市委干训班学习期间坦白揭发出来的。孙世贺在解放后，经过长期的学习与改造，政治觉悟提高，参加了青年团。但仍因碍于情面而未能将该案早日揭发。今年参加市委干训班学习后，该员始将思想搞通，自动检讨出曾于去年三月间与核算股刁显章、任长源及收费股朱连启、孙顺城等集体贪污八万余元（当时折合小米五千余斤），他本人分了一万元赃款。北京电业局负责同志根据这一线索去找刁显章等四人谈话，从他们自相矛盾的谈话中，追究出集体贪污的实情：核算股刁显章等滥制收据，由钢印管理员孙顺成私自盖印，再由收费员李宗庭等以欺骗手法留下用户的收据。这样他们便将收到的电费私吞了。
    北京电业局为了弄清全部事实，已将他们转送法院处理。
    现在中央人民政府所属各机关都在进行精简节约运动，而我们国营电业中仍有贪污事件发生，并且经过了一年多长时间的隐藏与掩盖之后，才由个别的觉悟分子坦白出来。这是领导上疏于检查的结果。希望电业管理总局根据这次揭发的集体贪污案的材料，在干部中进行教育，按照中央人民政府政务院精简节约的指示，发动群众进行检举，以消灭各地电业中的铺张浪费与贪污现象。

    编者按：刁显章等的集体贪污案，说明了北京市电业局对于旧的制度未作彻底改革，致使贪污分子仍和过去一样，制造假据，从中舞弊前后贪污小米五万余斤，而未被发觉。这种恶果是由该局领导上的严重官僚主义造成的。因此，我们希望该局领导同志在这次整风中进行深刻的检讨，严格经济手续，改革旧的制度，并应切实认真的教育与改造留用人员，提高他们的政治觉悟。
