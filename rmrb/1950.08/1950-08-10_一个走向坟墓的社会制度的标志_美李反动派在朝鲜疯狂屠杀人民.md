　　A Sign of a Social System Heading for the Grave
    The US-Li Clique's Mad Slaughter of the People in Korea
    By Alan Winnington, "The Daily Worker" Correspondent

    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th] Alan Winnington, correspondent for the British "The Daily Worker," reports: In mid-July, seven thousand Korean patriots were brutally massacred by the Syngman Rhee bandit gang police and constabulary, under the supervision of American officers, in a small valley one kilometer from Langmu Village (transliteration) near Daejeon. The weapons used to kill them were American rifles, pistols, and carbines; the trucks that carried them to their deaths were American trucks, and several of the drivers were Americans; the cigarette packs scattered around the massacre site were also American-made. The shootings, beatings, and beheadings were carried out by Syngman Rhee's puppet constabulary and police, but this is the crime of the American invaders – one of the most heinous crimes in the world's history. Huge trenches – like those at Bergen-Belsen and Buchenwald (concentration camps where German Nazi bandits massacred people) – were used to cover up the traces of this massacre.
    I have spent several days investigating this series of American atrocities – all carried out under the instructions of American "advisors." Seeing this evidence, one can only draw one conclusion: what is happening here is the same as what happened in Europe. As soon as the Truman-Syngman Rhee conspiracy to invade the North was launched, orders were given to systematically physically eliminate all "political prisoners" and democrats then held in Syngman Rhee's prisons. Their number is between 200,000 and 400,000, but the exact number cannot be known at present.
    Langmu Village is on the highway seven kilometers southeast of Daejeon. On July 30th and 31st, I spent a lot of time here, examining the mass graves, taking photographs, collecting several thousand American cartridge clips scattered on the ground, interviewing more than twenty eyewitnesses, and verifying every detail. The situation during the massacre was as follows:
    On July 2nd, several truckloads of Syngman Rhee's police and constabulary drove into the village. They used rifles to force the villagers and people from nearby areas to dig many pits in the mountains. I saw several large pits, the largest being 200 meters long, 4 to 2 meters wide, and uniformly 2 meters deep. There were also two pits about half the length of the largest, and the remaining ones varied in size, the smallest being about 30 meters long, but the width and depth were the same. After the first pit was dug, the police and constabulary began on July 4th to transport prisoners from local prisons to this location in American trucks. Some of these trucks were driven by American drivers. The method of loading these "prisoners" onto the trucks was as follows: in the prisons, they were knocked unconscious with thick clubs, then piled onto the trucks – one layer of people, padded with a layer of straw mats, stacked layer upon layer like sardines. Seated on top of the pile of people were constables (these facts were learned during visits to these prisons and conversations with some prisoners still in prison).
    Each truck carried more than fifty "prisoners," each man and woman's hands tied with wire. Just before the trucks reached the valley, two American jeeps arrived, carrying high-ranking American and puppet army officers, who stood around smoking and chatting. The trucks drove to the side of the first pit, and the prisoners were dragged out. Some of the "prisoners" on the bottom layer were obviously already dead, and most were dazed from beatings and starvation.
    Those "prisoners" who could still kneel were forced to kneel, and then six volleys of shots were fired into their backs in quick succession. Later, when the second truckload of people arrived, someone saw an American officer arguing and gesturing with a puppet officer. After that, each "prisoner" was only shot once in the chest or back of the neck, and if they were not killed, they were finished off with a Japanese sword.
    Those who could not kneel were beaten to death on the ground or killed with a single sword stroke. The bodies were piled in the pit, and after this section was filled, the farmers were forced to spread a layer of soil on top to flatten it. At the same time, the trucks drove to a new location.
    This series of massacres lasted for three days – July 4th, 5th, and 6th. A total of more than sixty trucks were loaded, each carrying more than fifty people. Even by the most conservative estimate, the number of deaths these days would not be less than three thousand.
    There were no more shootings until July 17th, but the farmers continued to dig pits under the threat of Syngman Rhee's police rifles. It is remembered that on the evening of the 16th, the People's Army crossed the Geum River twenty kilometers north of Daejeon. At dawn on the 17th, jeeps arrived, and soon the trucks began to drive into the valley.
    This time, the trucks were filled with prisoners in the same way, but each truck carried one hundred or more people – time was running out, and the People's Army was coming. It is calculated that there were a total of thirty-seven trucks that day – more than three thousand seven hundred patriots. The massacre lasted from dawn until after midnight.
    This time, many "prisoners" were thrown into the pits alive, with the dead piled on top of them. Someone saw American officers urging the constables to hurry up. Only one prisoner escaped, jumping off the truck while it was moving. He told the farmers that the People's Army would soon come to avenge the dead.
    People in the village often saw their friends, relatives, and brothers among the victims. Someone watched his brother being shot, but they did not indicate that they knew each other. On another occasion, a farmer saw his brother-in-law among the victims and cried out in horror. He was immediately arrested, tied up, beaten, and shot. After the 17th, the police attempted to round up the parents, wives, husbands, and children of the victims. But they did not have time. On the 18th, 19th, and 20th, only a few single trucks went to the valley. On those days, several children were killed.
    In that valley, the terrible odor required great endurance to approach. The pits were filled with corpses, covered with only a thin layer of soil. This layer of soil had been eroded by wind and rain, revealing a pile of jumbled bones and rotting bodies. In many places, due to post-mortem rigidity, some people's arms, legs, and heads protruded from the ground, as if they had struggled to get air and survive in the end. In the middle of the largest pit, half buried, a pair of women's hands tied with rope protruded. Here, a leg protruded, with flesh still peeling from the bone. The so-called "parents' pit" was dug on the hillside, filled only halfway with corpses, and not completely covered. These victims had been killed only eleven days earlier, and in the dry air, their bodies were still intact. They had been pushed down there, with bullet holes in their chests. Some people's faces had been blown off, and the backs of some people's skulls had been cracked open. The hands of these corpses were all tied with wire. Here lie the bodies of these people, whose crime was that they were the parents, wives, husbands, or children of democrats who demanded Korean reunification, freedom, and freedom from American financial domination. They themselves were never "political prisoners," but were related to "political prisoners." On the grass between the pits that dotted the hillside, cartridge casings were scattered, each bullet having killed a Korean hero – a man or woman who fought for peace and against a police state tightly controlled by American efficiency, Nazi methods, and feudalism. This is the result of some of my other investigations. They are sufficient to show that this is a policy, not an isolated event.
    When the People's Army liberated Seoul on June 28th, Syngman Rhee's army and police began to flee from Incheon, but when they realized they had time, they returned on the 29th. Meanwhile, in Incheon, the people had already released the "political prisoners," established a People's Committee, and paraded in the streets. The returning police and constabulary opened fire with automatic weapons, killing eight people on the spot. After that, the police and constabulary began to search houses one by one, arresting well-known democrats and their families. It is reported that more than a thousand patriots were taken to the beach and thrown into the sea. Their hands were tied behind their backs, their legs were broken, they were stabbed all over, and their abdomens were cut open. In short, they were maimed and then thrown into the sea from the ship. Every day their corpses floated on the surface of the sea. The person in command of this operation was an American engineer on two American power-generating ships anchored in the port of Incheon. Workers had seen him directing the constabulary's actions. This person had been captured alive in Incheon, along with many reactionaries who had not had time to escape.
    In Suwon: After the fall of Seoul, it was Syngman Rhee's second "capital." Syngman Rhee's so-called "ministers," American "Ambassador" Muccio, and a small group of American "advisors" lived here in the agricultural college. During the short period that this group stayed here before the People's Army surrounded Suwon, many young women were kidnapped to this headquarters and raped by this group. The person responsible for rounding up the women was a Principal Kim, who had previously been a pawn for the Japanese. American soldiers roamed the streets with tommy guns, committing rape, plunder, and all kinds of evil deeds. As of now, 260 bodies of murdered patriots have been found in Suwon, buried in eight mass graves in the four suburbs of the city. More bodies will still be found, because it is said that the prisoners in the two sub-prisons of the notorious Seodaemun Prison in Seoul have been taken away from Seoul and slaughtered. I went to see these mass graves and took photographs of the bodies, American cartridge clips, and empty American cigarette packs as evidence. When I went to see a certain mass grave, a group of people looking for bodies were digging there. When I left, they were still crying and continuing to dig.
    In Pyeongtaek: Pyeongtaek is a small city of only 20,000 people, now bombed flat. On the nights of July 3rd and 4th, 1,130 local patriots were collectively massacred. The murderers did not have enough wire, so they tied the arrested people with straw ropes, and two of them bit through the straw ropes and escaped.
    In Jochiwon: Jochiwon is about the same size as Pyeongtaek. 156 people were killed locally. The methods were still shooting, smashing their heads with stones, and stabbing them.
    Seoul was relatively lucky. The People's Army advanced so quickly that even Syngman Rhee's ministers barely managed to escape, so there was no time to carry out large-scale massacres. Apart from some who were taken away, tens of thousands of "political prisoners" were released by the People's Army.
    The same fate befell all cities, large and small. These are sufficient proof that the Americans have completely inherited the German Nazi bandits' full set of brutal terrorist acts and mad destruction of all good and progressive things. This is a sign of a social system heading for the grave. The massacre of innocent people in Korea will inevitably unite the people of all nations in the world to end this terror. Then, these martyrs will not have sacrificed in vain.

　　一个走向坟墓的社会制度的标志
    美李反动派在朝鲜疯狂屠杀人民
    英国工人日报记者  阿兰·魏宁敦
    【新华社平壤九日电】英国工人日报记者阿兰·魏宁敦报道：七月中，有七千名朝鲜爱国志士，在距大田附近郎武村（译音）一公里的一个小山谷里，惨遭美国军官监督下的李承晚匪帮警宪集体屠杀。用来杀害他们的武器是美国的步枪、手枪和卡宾枪；装载他们走向死亡的卡车是美国的卡车，而且有几名司机是美国人；仍然散在屠杀地点的香烟包，也是美国货。枪杀、殴打、砍头的事，是李承晚傀儡宪兵和警察做的，但是这是美国侵略者的罪行——世界上空前的最恶毒的罪行之一。巨大的壕沟——如同在贝尔森和布肯瓦尔德（德国纳粹匪徒屠杀人民的集中营）的壕沟一样——被利用来掩盖这次大屠杀的痕迹。
    我已经花了几天的功夫调查美国这样的一连串暴行——这一切暴行都是在美国“顾问”的指示下进行的。看到这个证据，只可能得出一个结论：这里所发生的事情和在欧洲发生过的事情一样。杜鲁门和李承晚侵犯北方的阴谋一发动，就下令把所有当时被关在李承晚监牢里的“政治犯”和民主人士加以有计划的肉体消灭。他们的数目在二十万到四十万之间，但确切数目现在还无法知道。
    郎武村在大田东南七公里的大路上。七月三十日、三十一日两天，我在这里花了很多时间，查看死人坑，拍摄照片，搜集了几个成千地散乱在地上的美国子弹夹，分别询问了二十余名目击者，核对每一细节。屠杀时的情况是这样的：
    七月二日，满满几卡车的李承晚警察及宪兵开入村内，他们用步枪胁迫村民及附近地方的人到山中掘了许多土坑。我看到几个大坑，最大的长二百公尺，宽四公尺至二公尺不等，深一律二公尺。还有两个坑约有最大的一半长，其余大小不等，最小的约三十公尺长，但宽度和深度都是一样。在掘好第一个坑以后，警察与宪兵便在七月四日开始用美国卡车把囚犯从地方监狱运到这个地点。这些卡车有一些是由美军司机驾驶的。往卡车上装这些“囚犯”的办法是这样的：在监狱里，用粗大的棍棒把他们打昏，然后堆上卡车——放一层人，垫一层草袋，这样一层又一层像沙丁鱼一样地堆积起来。坐在人堆上的是宪兵（这些事实是在访问这些监狱及与一些仍在狱中的囚犯交谈时获悉的）。
    每辆卡车载了五十余名“囚犯”，每个男女的手都用铁丝绑起来。恰好在卡车驶达山谷之前，两辆美国吉普车驶到了，载来了美军与伪军的高级军官，他们站在周围吸烟闲谈。卡车驶到第一个坑的旁边，囚徒们都被拖了出来。最底下一层的一些“囚犯”显然已经死了，大多数都因为遭受殴打和挨饿而昏昏迷迷。
    那些尚能跪下的“囚犯”被迫跪下，然后背后就一连气地打了六排枪。后来第二卡车人运到，有人看见一个美国军官与傀儡军官在争论，指手划脚。此后，每个“囚犯”都只在胸口或后颈被打一枪，如果没有打死，就用一把日本刀来解决。
    那些不能跪下的，都被打死在地上，或者一刀杀死。尸体都堆在坑里，这一段堆满后，就强迫农民们铺上一层土来踏平它。同时卡车则驶到新的地方。
    这一次的一系列的屠杀，进行了三天——七月四日、五日和六日。共装了六十余辆卡车，每辆载五十余人。即使是最保守的估计，这几天死亡的人数也不会少于三千人。
    在七月十七日以前没有再枪杀人，但农民们在李承晚警察的步枪威胁下继续掘坑。人们记得，十六日晚上，人民军越过了大田以北二十公里的锦江。十七日拂晓，吉普车驶来，不久卡车即开始驶入山谷。
    这一次，卡车上用同样方法装满了囚犯，但每辆卡车装的人数在一百名或一百名以上——时间已经不多，人民军就要来了。这一天，据计算共有三十七辆卡车——三千七百余名爱国志士。屠杀从拂晓起进行到午夜以后。
    这一次，许多“囚犯”被活着投入坑里，而把已经死了的堆在他们上面。有人见到美国军官在催促宪兵更快一点。只有一名俘虏逃掉了，他在卡车正开行的时候跳下车来。他告诉农民说：人民军不久就要来替死者报仇。
    村庄里的人时常看到在牺牲者中有他们的朋友、亲属和弟兄。有人看着他的兄弟被枪杀，但是他们并没有表示互相认识。另外一次，一个农民在牺牲者中间看到他的内弟，于是发出惊恐的叫声。他立刻被捉起来，捆起施以毒打后枪杀。在十七日以后，警察企图围捕牺牲者的父母、妻子、丈夫及孩子。但是，他们没有来得及。在十八日、十九日及二十日，只有几次单辆卡车到山谷里去。在那些日子里，若干儿童被杀害了。
    在那山谷里，可怕的气味需要有极大的忍受才能走近。那些坑填满了尸首，仅有一层薄土掩盖着。这层土被风雨吹打了许多洞穴，从这些洞穴中可以看到一堆乱骨头和腐烂的人身。在许多地方，由于死后身体的僵直，使一些人的臂、腿和头部露到地面上来，好像最后曾用力挣扎，想得到空气和活命。在最大的一个坑一半深的地方，一双用绳绑着的妇女的手伸出来。在这里，有一只腿伸出来，皮肉还在从骨头上脱落。他们所说的“父母坑”是在山边上挖掘的，尸首只填满了一半，而且没有完全盖好。这些牺牲者被杀死不过十一天，在干燥的空气里，他们的尸身仍然完好。他们是被推倒在那里的，胸部有着子弹打穿的洞。有些人的面孔被炸掉，有些人的头盖骨后部已经裂开，这些尸首的两手都用铁丝捆缚着。这里躺着这些人民的尸身，他们的罪名是因为他们是要求朝鲜统一、自由，和不受美国金融统治的民主分子的父母、妻子、丈夫或子女。他们自己从来不是“政治犯”，但是与“政治犯”有关系。在布满了半山谷的坑与坑之间的草地上，散布着子弹壳，每一颗子弹打死了一名朝鲜英雄——一位为争取和平、反对以美国效率、纳粹方法及封建制度紧密控制的警察国家而斗争的男子或妇女。这就是我所作的另外一些调查的结果。它们足以说明这是一种政策而不是一个孤立的事件。
    当人民军在六月二十八日解放汉城的时候，李承晚的陆军和警察就从仁川开始逃窜，但当他们发现还有时间的时候，他们在二十九日又回来了。同时，在仁川，人民已经释放了“政治犯”，成立起人民委员会，并在街上游行。跑回来的警宪，就以自动武器射击，当场有八人被杀害。此后，警宪即开始挨户搜索，把著名的民主人士及他们的家属都逮捕起来。据悉共有一千余爱国志士被押赴海滨，投入海中。他们都是双手反缚，两腿折断，遍体刺伤，开膛破腹。总之，是被弄得四肢残废，再从船上被投入海中。每天都有他们的尸首漂浮在海面上。指挥这种行动的人，有一个是停泊在仁川港内两艘美国发电船上的美国工程师。工人们曾见他指挥宪兵行动。这个人已经和许多没有来得及逃跑的反动分子，一同在仁川被活捉了。
    在水原：在汉城陷落后，它是李承晚的第二“首都”。李承晚的所谓“部长”们、美“大使”缪锡俄以及一小批美国“顾问”，就曾住在这里的农业学院中。在人民军包围水原之前，这批人在此地停留不多几天的期间内，就有许多青年妇女被绑架到这个总部内，被这批人强奸了。负责搜罗妇女的是一个姓金的校长，他从前给日本人当过爪牙。美兵拿着汤姆枪在街上游荡，奸淫掳掠，无所不为。截至目前为止，水原已发现被害的爱国志士尸体二百六十具，分别埋在该市四郊八个尸坑中。此后仍将有尸体发现，因为据说恶名昭彰的汉城西门监狱的两个分监的被囚人士，都已被押离汉城而遭屠杀。我曾去查看了这些尸坑，并把这些尸体、美制子弹夹以及美国烟卷的空包摄成照片，作为证据。我去查看某尸坑时，正有一群找寻尸首的人在那里探掘。我离开时，他们还在一边哭泣，一边继续发掘。
    在平泽：平泽是仅有两万人口的小城，现已被炸弹炸平。在七月三日、四日两夜间，当地曾有爱国志士一千一百三十人被集体屠杀。凶手们的铁丝不够用了，就用草绳把被捕者捆起来，因而有两人咬断草绳而逃脱。
    在鸟致院：鸟致院差不多与平泽一样大。当地有一百五十六人被害。方法仍是枪毙、用石块砸碎头部、以及刺杀。
    汉城算是比较幸运的。人民军进展得那样迅速，以致连李承晚的部长们都难得逃跑，因而也就来不及实行大规模虐杀了。除了一部分被押走者外，当地有数万“政治犯”被人民军释放。
    各城市无论大小，都有过同样的遭遇。这些足以证明：美国人已经把德国纳粹匪徒全套的残暴恐怖行为，以及对于一切善良进步事物的疯狂破坏，完全继承过来了。这是一个走向坟墓的社会制度的标志。朝鲜无辜人民的被屠杀，必然地要使世界各族人民团结起来，结束这种恐怖手段。那时，这些烈士就不是白白牺牲的了。
