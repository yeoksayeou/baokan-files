　　U.S. Aircraft Again Invade Our Northeast Airspace, Killing and Wounding Our Compatriots
    Foreign Minister Zhou Sends Another Telegram to the Security Council
    Points Out U.S. Government’s Intention to Sabotage Peace Is Now Obvious
    Halting U.S. Aggression and Withdrawing U.S. Troops from Korea Is Urgent

    【Xinhua News Agency, August 30th】The air force of the American invading troops in Korea continues to invade our country's airspace and kill and wound our people. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of our country, has once again telegraphed Malik, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Trygve Lie, requesting the Security Council to immediately take effective measures to stop the American invading troops in Korea from expanding their aggression, and to withdraw the American invading troops from Korea as soon as possible. The telegram is as follows: To Mr. Malik, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Trygve Lie:
    Following August 27th, the air force of the American invading troops in Korea once again invaded the airspace of our People's Republic of China on August 29th, killing and wounding our Chinese people. At 17:45 on that day, four American fighter planes invaded the airspace of Lagu Shao in Kuandian County, which belongs to the right bank of the Yalu River in our country, from the sky over Korea to conduct reconnaissance. Then, they flew along the right bank of the Yalu River to Changdianhekou, about one kilometer away from Lagu Shao, and fired at our civilian boats, killing one of our fishermen and wounding two fishermen. At 17:50, they flew to the airspace over Gulouzi, northeast of Andong, and fired at our civilian boats again, killing three more of our fishermen, seriously injuring two, and slightly injuring three.
    This continued provocation and killing by the American invading troops in Korea proves that the U.S. government's intention to expand the war and undermine world peace is now obvious. I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, once again lodge a complaint and request to the United Nations: The United Nations Security Council should immediately take effective measures in accordance with my suggestion of the 27th of this month to stop the American invading troops in Korea from expanding their aggression, and withdraw the American invading troops from Korea as soon as possible, in order to prevent the situation from escalating, which is an urgent matter.
    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China

　　美机又侵入我东北领空杀伤我同胞
    周外长再电安理会
    指出美政府破坏和平意图已昭然若揭
    制止美国侵略撤退侵朝美军急不容缓
    【新华社三十日讯】美国侵略朝鲜军队的空军继续侵入我国领空，并杀伤我国人民。我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长已就此事再度致电联合国安全理事会主席马立克及秘书长赖伊，要求安理会立即采取有效措施制止美国侵略朝鲜军队扩大侵略的行为，并从速撤退美国侵略朝鲜军队。电文如下：成功湖联合国安全理事会主席马立克先生及秘书长赖伊先生：
    继八月二十七日之后，美国侵朝军队的空军于八月二十九日，又侵入我中华人民共和国领空，并杀伤我中国人民。时间在当日十七时四十五分，美国战斗机四架由朝鲜上空侵入鸭绿江右岸我国宽甸县属之拉古哨地方的上空侦察，继即沿鸭绿江右岸飞至距拉古哨约一公里之长甸河口，向我国民船射击，杀死我国渔夫一人，伤渔夫二人；至十七时五十分，飞至安东东北之古楼子上空，再度向我国民船射击，又杀死我国渔夫三人，重伤二人，轻伤三人。
    美国侵朝军队这种继续挑衅和残杀的行为，证明美国政府扩大战争和破坏世界和平的意图已昭然若揭。我现代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府再度向联合国提出控诉和要求：联合国安全理事会应该根据我本月二十七日的建议立即采取有效措施，制止美国侵朝军队扩大侵略的行为，并从速撤退美国侵朝军队，以免事态扩大，实为急不容缓之举。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来
     一九五○年八月三十日
