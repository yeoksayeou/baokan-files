Strengthen Leadership, Correct Deviations
　　Shenyang Focuses on Inspection and Rectification
　　[Northeast News] According to the Northeast Daily, in order to strengthen the leadership over the rectification movement in various units, the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee organized three working groups after deploying the rectification movement. These groups were dispatched to state-owned enterprises, financial and economic organs, and trade departments to inspect and assist the CPC committees in those departments in reviewing and summarizing their work. The working groups have now discovered that, due to insufficient understanding of the spirit of the rectification instructions from the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast Bureau, several deviations have occurred: 1. Although the Municipal Committee had proposed that the focus of the CPC committees' rectification in state-owned enterprises should be on summarizing work related to the various basic policies in production, and that it should begin with self-criticism, many enterprise departments' committees and general branches have not grasped this spirit. According to the six plans already received by the Municipal Committee, most do not start from reviewing and inspecting work, but instead isolate the rectification of relationships or the rectification of individuals. For example, one enterprise department's committee proposed that "the key to rectification is the relationship between the Party committee, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League," and therefore rectified relationships first. One branch secretary said, "Rectification is mainly about the administration; the Party's work doesn't have much to do!" attempting not to rectify themselves but only to rectify others. 2. Some organs proposed: "…this time we must rectify severely, those who should be dismissed should be dismissed, those who should be prosecuted should be prosecuted, and we are now actively preparing materials…" "We must call back the previous few responsible persons and get to the bottom of the problems." This is clearly to deviate from inspecting current work and settle old scores. Some cadres believe that rectification is about rectifying corruption, and if they are not corrupt, then it has nothing to do with rectification. 3. Some organs separate the inspection and summary work in rectification from the improvement work, with one period being for inspection and summary work, and another period being for comprehensive improvement work. Some units spend too long studying documents (one month), and they study the documents in isolation without integrating them with inspection work. 4. There is a tendency for top-down disconnect. Some people believe: "If the higher levels rectify, the lower levels will automatically change, and there is no need to summarize and inspect work from top to bottom and from bottom to top and carry out self-criticism." Some cadres believe: "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked. It is the responsibility of the leaders to grasp the policies, what can the lower-level cadres do who are just implementing the policies." The Municipal Committee immediately began to correct these deviations after discovering them, and the Municipal Committee will conduct further in-depth mobilization to further implement the spirit of rectification.

　　加强领导纠正偏向
    沈阳重点检查整风
    【东北讯】据东北日报消息：中共沈阳市委为加强对各单位整风的领导，在布置整风后即组织了三个工作组，分别到国营企业、财经机关、贸易部门检查与帮助各该部门的中共党委检查总结工作。现工作组已发现由于各单位对中共中央及东北局指示的整风精神掌握不够，因而发生了若干偏差：一、虽然市委曾提出在国营企业部门的中共党委的整风，应以发展生产中的各种基本政策作为总结工作的重点，并首先应以自我批评的方法进行。但是不少企业部门的党委与总支并未掌握此种精神。据市委已收到的六份计划看，大都不是从总结检查工作着手，而是孤立地整关系或整人。如有的企业部门的党委提出“整风关键是党委、行政、工会、青年团关系问题”，因而先整关系。有的支书说：“整风主要是行政，党的工作没啥！”企图不整自己专整别人。二、有的机关提出：“……这次要狠狠整一下，该撤职的撤职，该法办的法办，现在正在积极准备材料……”“要把前任的几个负责人都调回来，把问题弄个水落石出。”这显然是要脱离检查目前工作而算旧账。有的干部认为整风是整贪污腐化，自己没有贪污腐化，也就与整风无关。三、有些机关把整风中的检查总结工作与改进工作分开，一个时期是检查总结工作，一个时期是全面改进工作。有的单位学习文件时间过长（一个月），而且是并未结合检查工作而孤立地去学习文件。四、有上下脱节的偏向，有一些人认为：“上边整了，下边就会自动改，不必自上而下、自下而上地总结检查工作与开展自我批评。”有的干部认为：“上梁不正下梁歪，掌握政策是领导上的责任，下边干部是执行政策者能有啥。”市委发现这些偏差后即着手纠正，市委并将再作深入动员，以进一步贯彻整风精神。
