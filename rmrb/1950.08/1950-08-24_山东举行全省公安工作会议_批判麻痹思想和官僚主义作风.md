According to the Shandong Dazhong Daily news: The Shandong Provincial People's Government Public Security Department convened the third provincial public security work conference on July 17th. This conference reviewed the summer prevention work in various regions and further deployed future work. According to the situation in various regions, in the province's summer prevention work, 20 gangs of bandits have been eliminated, 124 bandits have been annihilated, and several major enemy conspiracy riot cases have been solved; at the same time, considerable achievements have also been made in the work of banning reactionary gangs and secret societies. However, according to the conference's reflections, complacency is still quite prevalent among public security work cadres throughout the province. Many public security cadres mistakenly believe that now that the mainland has been basically liberated, the remaining bandits and spies will no longer be able to do much. This complacency has become an obstacle to further strengthening public security work throughout the province. At the same time, due to the existence of bureaucratic work styles in public security work, the failure to go deep into the masses to listen to opinions and understand the situation has led to a failure to promptly deal with some elements who should be resolutely suppressed, and the work of winning over coerced elements has also appeared weak, thereby arousing dissatisfaction among the masses. In addition, individual regions have also seen phenomena of random arrests and beatings, and extracting confessions by torture, violating policies. The meeting criticized these erroneous thoughts and work styles, and emphasized the organization and discipline of security work, laying a preliminary foundation for the province's public security departments to carry out a large-scale rectification movement.

　　山东举行全省公安工作会议
    批判麻痹思想和官僚主义作风
    【本报讯】据山东大众日报消息：山东省人民政府公安厅于七月十七日召开了第三次全省公安工作会议。这次会议，检查了各地区夏防工作的情况并进一步布置今后工作。根据各地的情况，在全省夏防工作中，已消灭了股匪二十股，歼匪一百二十四名，破获了敌人重大阴谋暴动案多起；同时在取缔反动帮会道门工作上也得到了相当的成绩。但是，根据会议的反映，全省公安工作干部中，麻痹思想还相当普遍。很多公安干部，错误地认为在大陆已基本解放了的今天，剩下的土匪特务再也不会有什么大作为了。这种麻痹思想成为进一步加强全省治安工作的障碍。同时，由于公安工作中存在着官僚主义作风，未能深入群众倾听意见、了解情况，以致对一些应该坚决镇压的分子，未能及时处理，争取胁从分子的工作也显得无力，因此引起了群众的不满。此外，个别地区还存在着乱捕乱打、刑讯逼供等违犯政策的现象。会议批判了这些错误的思想与作风，并强调了保卫工作的组织性与纪律性，为全省公安部门开展大规模整风运动打下了初步基础。
