    Behind the Front Lines

    The Munqing township area of Gyeongsangbuk-do experienced fierce fighting a week ago. We passed Korea's famous Uling north of Munqing. This ridge is both high and long, the most famous in Korea. The highway is carved into the mountain, with sheer cliffs on the left and precipices on the right. Many destroyed trucks, tanks, and cannons lay scattered along the roadside. American planes ravaged the sky all day long; they would drop several bombs if they spotted a person, a horse, or a cow. The highway was blasted into many deep pits. At night, engineering heroes worked intensely to restore it.

    Behind the front lines, we saw and heard many things about the American army. They are cowardly and brutal. The American armored vehicles destroyed by the People's Army all had their gun barrels pointing north and their fronts pointing south. The Americans blindly fired the turret 180 degrees, in order to facilitate escape. Simple fortifications were often found beside the highway, with small hills of howitzer shell casings piled haphazardly beside them; these were the American soldiers' artillery positions. They placed their mechanized artillery units beside the highway, also to facilitate escape. When American tank crewmen abandoned their vehicles, they would always lock the doors if they had a little time. Their purpose was to delay the People's Army from driving the vehicles, making it easier for American planes to arrive and bomb them. The prestige of the atomic heroes is nothing more than this. However, they are extremely shameless. For example, they poisoned the wells they retreated from and buried landmines in villages that the People's Army might occupy. In Chu-pung Pass of Kimcheon County (in Chungcheongbuk-do), more than 500 women and children took refuge in a railway tunnel, and the Americans discovered them. The Americans took away more than 100 young women, then blocked both ends of the tunnel and machine-gunned the remaining 400-plus people to death. These inhuman beasts in human clothing committed monstrous crimes in Korea. They once again gave a profound lesson to peace-loving people all over the world: if the imperialist war plot is not stopped, the current plight of Korea will appear in many places.

    We rested in a secluded valley village in the midst of myriad mountains. The village of more than 20 households now has only one old farmer left, a 70-year-old named Li Guiheng. Everyone else had fled to other places to escape the disaster, and only he remained in the village. His beard was snow-white, and he was wearing the white clothing of a Korean farmer, sitting cross-legged, staring blankly into the distance. He had a single son, who was conscripted by the Japanese seven years ago and has not been heard from since. Left alone, he had completely lost the joy of life. This time, he suffered another looting by the puppet army. The situation in this village was the same as after the Japanese "mopping-up" operations in our country's rural areas. Furniture and pots and pans were destroyed, clothes that could be worn were looted, and the ground was littered with disordered cotton covers; the puppet army had torn off all the cloth from the quilts.

    An exceptionally fierce battle had taken place on the high mountain half a mile south of the village. The old man told us a heroic story about the People's Army: the puppet army held the mountain, and the People's Army attacked upwards from the foot of the mountain. The two sides were too close together to speak. Soldiers of the People's Army said to the puppet army, "If you have the guts, dare to come down?" The puppet army didn't dare. The puppet army said to the People's Army, "If you have the guts, dare to come up?" A soldier of the People's Army took off his clothes, took two grenades, and strode towards the mountain. This kind of heroic spirit stunned the puppet army. The People's Army soldier threw out a grenade, and the puppet army turned and ran, so the People's Army occupied this forward position. The old man insisted that this story was true. Yes, the reason he insisted on this story was to represent his love and respect for the People's Army. There is no doubt that this Korean farmer, who is over seventy years old, saw the hope of Korea from the People's Army.

    The Power of the People

    Returning to Seoul from the front by the eastern route, we encountered enemy planes all night long. The highways in this area are even more beautiful, with green trees lining the roads. At first glance, they are umbrella-like cherry blossoms, and at second glance, they are candle-like poplars. However, driving without lights diminishes the beauty of the scenery.

    On the top of a high mountain, we saw a sea of darkness in the valley below, flashing with a field of star-like red lights. Getting closer and closer, it turned out to be a group of soldiers with bare arms, holding torches, rushing to repair a huge bridge. This bridge was destroyed by American planes during the day, and at night, the People's Army came to repair it. The sound of iron hitting stone, the ?? sound of leather shoes stepping on stones, and the panting shouts formed a tense and laboring musical movement. The bombs of the American planes cannot defeat the invincible will of the Korean people.

    Near the embankment, we encountered several endless streams of people. These were Korean farmers transporting ammunition to the front. They were wearing white clothes, carrying wooden frames on their backs that Korean farmers use to carry firewood, with two boxes of ammunition on each frame. Under the light of the car, I saw them working hard, sweating profusely, but everyone's face showed a firm expression. Some people had beards. There were no escorting soldiers. I remembered a story from four years ago, in 1946, when our People's Liberation War began. A foreign journalist, seeing a group of farmers transporting ammunition without soldiers following them in Handan, immediately ran to the Handan newspaper office and asked, "Why are these farmers transporting ammunition without soldiers to supervise them?" He had just come to the liberated area from the Kuomintang-controlled area, and he saw a completely different scene here from the Kuomintang-controlled area, so it was understandable that he asked this question. However, we must ask him in return, "Why do farmers need soldiers to escort them when they are transporting ammunition for their own army?" What happened in our country in the past is now being seen in Korea. Countless historical facts simultaneously prove that the will and power of the people are always invincible and unbeatable.

    According to Kim Dong-soo, vice-chairman of the Incheon County People's Committee, the enthusiasm of the people to support the front is truly touching. Incheon was liberated on July 4th, and from the 5th, 700 to 1,000 people participated in transportation and road repair every day. Some farmers in the county walked 90 li to the county seat, and before they could rest, they set off carrying ammunition on their backs. Old men refused the dissuasion of the staff and also came running, saying, "Old people can carry a little less."

    The office of the Incheon People's Committee was borrowed from a school classroom next to a small mountain, with more than 30 desks inside, filled with people. The vast majority of the staff were underground workers before liberation. Simple stationery, mimeograph machines, and paper were placed on the desks, and bundles of quilts were placed next to the desks. People are working hard.

    Many civilians were sitting on the playground outside the office. A dozen members of the propaganda team were singing and explaining current affairs to the civilians. This propaganda team was composed of college students from the northern half of the Republic, a total of 250 people, who had been working in the area south of the original 38th parallel for a month and are now going to the front. A female team member spoke to the civilians in a loud, masculine voice, explaining the reason why the patriotic reunification war will inevitably be victorious. According to the captain of the propaganda team, her name is Li Shunshi, and she is a student at Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang, and her father is a worker. Without the revolution, she would have no possibility of going to college. Therefore, she showed unusual enthusiasm in working in the newly liberated areas.

    The Taebaek Mountain Base Area

    The places we passed this time were all mountainous, the famous Taebaek Mountains of Korea. The Taebaek Mountains used to be the largest anti-American, anti-Li guerrilla base area in the southern half of the Republic, and this guerrilla base area persisted until this patriotic reunification war.

    In Chuncheon, the capital of Gangwon-do, I met with Bae Hyung-soon, chairman of the Gangwon-do People's Committee. Comrade Bae is 35 years old and has not yet married. Before the liberation of Gangwon-do, he was the deputy commander of the guerrilla army in the Taebaek Mountains. After the liberation of Gangwon-do, he left the army and became the chairman of the Do People's Committee.

    The guerrilla warfare in Gangwon-do was very active before liberation. Now, the guerrillas have advanced with the People's Army to the enemy's rear in Gyeongsangbuk-do. The Americans are most afraid of the guerrillas. As soon as they hear gunfire behind their butts, they immediately become chaotic without fighting and run away. On July 17, the Americans and the puppet army once landed in Uljin County (belonging to Gangwon-do) on the east coast, attempting to harass the inland. At that time, the People's Army had advanced to the south of Uljin, and the guard unit had not yet had time to arrive to defend. Uljin was temporarily in a state of gap, and a small number of local guerrillas came forward to meet the enemy and entangled with the enemy for two days. During this period, the People's Army rushed to support and wiped out all the landing enemies.

    Comrade Bae said: The members of the guerrilla team are all workers, poor farmers and revolutionary students, and Labor Party members account for more than one-half. The guerrilla team established the people's power in the Taebaek Mountain base area, implemented various democratic reforms, and won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses. The guerrilla base area constantly eroded the puppet regime. From the end of 1949, Lee Seung-man concentrated four divisions and attacked the Taebaek Mountains with Daejeon as the center. Thus, an extremely cruel struggle began. The enemy implemented the "three-all policy" of killing all, burning all, and looting all in the guerrilla area, with an average of nearly a thousand victims per county in Gangwon-do. The enemy occasionally captured individual guerrilla team members and deliberately transported them to the market, where they were bitten to death by foreign dogs in public, in an attempt to create a terroristic mood that would separate the people from the guerrilla war. At this time, I remembered the photo album confiscated from the enemy that I saw at Minister Park Chang-ok of the Propaganda Department of the Pyongyang Labor Party Central Committee, which contained many photos recording the atrocities of the Lee Seung-man bandit gang in the massacre of guerrilla team members. "But," Bae Hyung-soon said, "we never succumbed. In the most difficult times, we operated in groups of five, scattered and continued to attack the enemy. We persisted in studying and living in battle, learning the strategies and tactics of the Chinese guerrilla war." He said humorously, "The enemy was also 'brave' for a moment. That's because they knew our ammunition was scarce. However, when they knew that our bayonets were still very sharp, they immediately showed further incompetence and cowardice."

    Bae Hyung-soon told two "very pleasant" stories. Once in July 1949, 1,500 puppet troops surrounded Cheongnyang Mountain in Gyeongsangbuk-do. The enemy was commanded by two American officers. Cheongnyang Mountain had 200 guerrilla team members, with only thirty-odd rifles. A fierce battle lasted all day, and at night, the guerrilla team dispersed and broke through, without any casualties. The enemy, however, transported back more than eighty bodies. Another time, in September 1949, the guerrilla team sneaked into the town of Munqing County and felt their way into the puppet police station. They first stabbed the chief of the puppet police station to death with bayonets, and then burned down the police station's building. The enemy didn't know how many guerrilla team members had come, and in a panic, they fired randomly, while the guerrilla team had already calmly withdrawn, and the enemy was still shooting blindly. The enemy's bullets killed many of the enemy.

　　一面是残暴的怯懦的生番
    一面是光荣的英雄的人民
    朝鲜南半部新解放区目击记（续完）
    本报特派朝鲜战地记者  李庄
    在火线后方
    庆尚北道的闻庆乡一带，在一周以前，曾经有过激烈的战斗。我们在闻庆以北经过朝鲜有名的乌岭。此岭既高且长，为朝鲜第一。公路凿山而成，路左为绝壁。路右为悬崖，许多被击毁的卡车、坦克和大炮，不规则的躺在路旁。美国飞机整日在天空肆虐，它们发现一个人，一匹马或一头牛，都会投下几颗炸弹。公路被炸成许多深坑。夜间，工兵英雄们紧张的进行复旧工程。
    在火线的后方，我们看到与听到许多关于美军的事情。他们怯懦而残暴。被人民军击毁的美国装甲汽车，都是炮口向北，车头向南。美国人把炮塔回转一百八十度盲目射击，为的是便于逃跑。公路旁边，常常发现一些简单的工事，工事旁边凌乱的堆着小丘一样的榴弹炮弹壳，这是美国兵的炮兵阵地。他们把机械化的炮队摆在公路旁边，也是为的便于逃跑。美国的坦克手弃车逃窜时，只要还有一点时间，一定把车门锁住，他们的目的，是使人民军来开车时延误时间，便于美国飞机赶来轰炸。原子英雄的威风原来不过如此。但是，他们却十分无耻。例如他们在撤退后的水井中放毒药，在人民军可能进驻的村庄埋地雷。金闻（在忠清北道）县秋风岭五百多名妇孺，躲在一个火车隧道中避难，被美国人发现了。美国人携走一百多青年妇女，然后堵住隧道的两口，用机枪杀死剩下的四百多人。这些毫无人性的衣冠禽兽，在朝鲜造下了滔天的罪行。他们再一次给予全世界爱好和平的人民一个深刻的教训：帝国主义战争的阴谋如果不加以制止，朝鲜现在的遭遇在许多地方都会出现。
    我们在万山丛中的幽谷村休息。二十多户人家的村庄，此时只剩下一个七十岁的名叫李贵恒的老农。别人都去旁的地方逃难，只有他一人留在村里。他胡子雪白，穿着朝鲜农民的白色衣裳，盘膝而坐，两目无光地注视着远方。他有一个独生儿子，七年前被日寇征兵走了，迄今没有消息。剩下他孑然一人，完全失掉了生活的乐趣。他这一次又遭受了伪军的洗劫。这个村庄的情形，就和日寇在我国农村中“扫荡”过后一样。家具锅碗被捣毁了，能穿的衣服被抢走了，地上堆着零乱的棉花套子，伪军把被子上的布都撕走了。
    在村南一里的高山上曾经发生过异常激烈的战斗。老人告诉我们一个关于人民军的英勇故事：伪军在山上据守，人民军从山下仰攻。两方距离太近，说起话来。人民军战士对伪军说：“你们有种，敢下来吗？”伪军不敢。伪军对人民军说：“你们有种，敢上来吗？”一个人民军的战士脱光衣服，拿着两个手榴弹，向山上大步走去。这种神勇的气概，把伪军吓呆了。人民军战士丢出颗手榴弹，伪军掉头就跑，人民军因此占领了这个前进阵地。老人坚持说这个故事是真的。是的，他之所以坚持这个故事，是代表他对人民军的敬爱。毫无疑问，这个年过古稀的朝鲜农民，从人民军方面看见朝鲜的希望了。
    人民的力量
    从前方绕东路回汉城，终夜遇到敌机。这一带的公路更美，路旁绿树成行。一看是雨伞一样的樱花，一看是腊烛一样的白杨。只是行车不能开灯，减煞了景物的美丽。
    在一个高山顶上，我们看到黑暗的海洋似的山谷中，闪烁着一片星星一样的红光。渐行渐近，原来是一群光脱臂膀的士兵，手擎火把，抢修一座巨大的桥梁。此桥在白天被美国飞机炸毁，夜里，人民军就来抢修了。铁石撞击声，皮鞋跨在石头上的??声，以及气喘喘的呼喊声，蔚成一派紧张劳动的音乐。美国飞机的炸弹，是不能战胜朝鲜人民无敌的意志的。
    在堤岸附近，我们遇到几股没有尽头的人的洪流。这是朝鲜的农民们在向前方送子弹。他们穿着白衣服，背上负着朝鲜农民背柴用的木架，每个木架上放着两箱子弹。在车灯照耀下，我看到他们辛苦的行动着，汗流满面，但每一个人的脸上都显出一种坚毅的表情。有些人长着胡子。没有一个押运的士兵。我想起四年以前，即一九四六年，我国人民解放战争开始时的一个故事。有一个外国记者，在邯郸看到一群没有士兵跟着的运送子弹的农民，立刻跑到邯郸报社去问：“为什么这些运输子弹的农民，没有士兵监视呢？”他是才从国民党统治区到解放区来的，他在这里看到了一种和国民党统治区完全不同的情景，发出这种疑问，原是可以理解的。但是，我们不得不反问他：“为什么农民给自己的军队输送子弹，还要士兵押运呢？”过去在我国发生的事情，今天又在朝鲜看到了，无数的历史同时证明，人民的意志与力量，总是战无不胜，攻无不取的。
    据应川郡人民委员会副委员长金童洙说：人民支援前线的热情之高，实在令人感动。应川是七月四日解放的，从五日起，每天都有七八百人至一千人参加运输和修路。有些县境的农民，走九十里路到县城，未及休息，就背着子弹出发。老汉们拒绝工作人员的劝阻，也跑了来，他们说：“上了年纪的人，可以少背一点儿。”
    应川人民委员会的办公室，系借用一个小山旁边的学校的教室，里面放着三十多张桌子，坐满了人。工作人员绝大数都是解放以前的地下工作者。办公桌上放着简单的文具，油印机和纸张，办公桌旁边，放着成捆的被子。人们紧张的工作者。
    办公室外的操场上，坐着许多民工。十几个宣传队的队员正给民工唱歌和解释时事。这个宣传队是由共和国北半部的大学生组成的，共二百五十人，已经在原三八线以南地区工作了一个月，现在要到前方去。一个女队员用洪亮的男人一样的声音向民工讲话，解说爱国统一战争必然胜利的道理。据宣传队长说：她名叫李顺实，是平壤金日成大学的学生，她的父亲是个工人。如果没有革命，她没有任何上大学的可能。因此，她在新解放区工作，表现了异乎寻常的积极。
    太白山根据地
    我们此次走过的地方，都是山地，是朝鲜有名的太白山区。太白山曾经是共和国南半部最大的抗美反李游击根据地，这个游击根据地，一直坚持到此次爱国统一战争时期。
    在江原道的首府春川，我会见了道人民委员会委员长裴亨淳，裴同志现年三十五岁，尚未结婚。在江原道解放前，他是太白山区游击军的副司令，江原道解放后，离开部队，当了道人民委员会的委员长。
    江原道的游击战争，在解放前非常活跃。现在，游击队随着人民大军前进已经到庆尚北道的敌人后方了。美国人最怕游击队。他们只要听到屁股后面发生枪声，立刻不战自乱，抹头就跑。七月十七日，美国人和傀儡军一度在东海岸上的蔚珍县（属于江原道）登陆，企图向内地骚扰。当时人民军已经进至蔚珍以南，警备队还来不及赶到守备。蔚珍暂时成为空隙状态，当地少数游击队出头迎战，和敌人纠缠了两天。在这一期间，人民军兼程赶到支援，将登陆的敌人全部歼灭。
    裴同志说：游击队的成员都是工人、贫苦农民和革命学生，劳动党员占二分之一以上。游击队在太白山根据地建立了人民政权，实行了各种民主改革，获得广大群众的热心拥护。游击根据地不断侵蚀着伪政权。从一九四九年年底起，李承晚集中四个师团，以大田为中心，向太白山区进攻。于是，极端残酷的斗争开始了。敌人在游击区实行杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光政策”，江原道平均每县被害者近千人。敌人偶然俘虏了个别游击队员，故意运到集市上，当众用洋狗咬死，企图造成一种使人民脱离游击战争的恐怖情绪。这时，我想起在平壤劳动党中央宣传部朴昌玉部长处看到的缴自敌人的照片贴本，里面有许多幅照片，记录着李承晚匪帮惨杀游击队员的暴行。“但是，”裴亨淳说：“我们绝没有屈服。在最困难的时期，我们五人一组，分散活动，照旧打击敌人。我们在战斗中坚持着学习生活，学习中国游击战争的战略战术。”他幽默地说：“敌人也曾‘勇敢’过一刹那时间。那是因为他们晓得我们的弹药缺乏了。不过，当着他们晓得我们的刺刀仍然非常锐利以后，马上又显出更进一步的无能和怯懦。”
    裴亨淳说了两个“非常惬意”的故事。一次在一九四九年七月，一千五百个伪军包围了庆尚北道的清凉山。敌人由两个美国军官指挥着。清凉山有两百名游击队员，只有三十几支步枪。激烈的战斗进行了一整天，夜里，游击队分散突围，无一伤亡。敌人却运回去八十多具尸体。还有一次，是在一九四九年九月，游击队潜入闻庆郡城，摸到伪警察所里。先用刺刀刺死伪警察所长，接着烧毁了警察所的房屋。敌人不知道来了多少游击队，仓惶之中胡乱射击，游击队已经从容撤退了，敌人还在瞎打。敌人的子弹打死了不少的敌人。
