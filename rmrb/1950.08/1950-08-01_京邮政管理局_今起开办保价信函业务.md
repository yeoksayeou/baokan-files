　　Beijing Postal Administration
    To Launch Insured Letter Service Today
    In order to serve the people, the Beijing Postal Administration and its affiliated bureaus will launch an "Insured Letter" service starting August 1st. "Insured Letters" can contain cash, grain ration tickets, and other valuable securities or important documents. All post offices using Renminbi can mutually send insured letters containing cash (but cannot send them to the Northeast region). "Insured Letters" have the advantages of remittances without the hassle of withdrawals. As for "Insured Letters" containing grain ration tickets, valuable securities, or important documents, they are not subject to regional restrictions and can be sent to the Northeast.

　　京邮政管理局
    今起开办保价信函业务
    北京邮政管理局及所属各局，为了便利人民，将自八月一日起举办《保价信函》业务，《保价信函》内可以装寄现钞、柴粮票及其他有价证券或重要文件。凡通用人民币的各地邮局，都可互寄装有现钞的保价信函（但不能寄往东北区）。《保价信函》有汇兑的优点，没取款的麻烦。至于装寄柴粮票，有价证券，或重要文件的《保价信函》，则不受区域的限制，可以寄往东北。
