Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: This year, the national railways have begun to move from the temporary repair stage to the normal transportation stage in the first half of the year. The number of loaded wagons reached 105.2 percent of the original semi-annual plan. The national average wagon turnaround rate was 3.68 days in the first quarter and 2.99 days in the second quarter, both shorter than the annual plan of 3.72 days. The national railway transportation efficiency has increased by 50% compared to the end of last year. The punctuality rate of trains reached over 90%. From January to June this year, the national railway mainly transported goods such as coal, grain, timber, salt, cement, and cotton, totaling 49,233,353 tons, and transported 72,492,000 passengers. The average daily locomotive mileage increased to 327 kilometers, exceeding the highest standard of 229.4 kilometers in Northeast China under the puppet Manchukuo regime by 42.5%. The national railway factories' production in the first half of the year, except for locomotives due to severe damage which completed 99.3 percent of the plan, passenger cars completed 122 percent of the plan, and freight cars completed 104 percent of the plan. Eleven factories including Changxindian, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Huanggu Village, and Jiang'an all completed their plans. Only the engineering, public works, and telecommunications work failed to complete due to overly high planned targets and untimely supply of materials. However, the permanent restoration project of bridges has completed 74.4 percent of the annual task in the first half of the year, which has exceeded the plan. In terms of finance, the operating income of the North and South railways completed 97.78 percent of the semi-annual plan and 50.6 percent of the annual plan, exceeding half of the annual income. Railway financial cash revenue and expenditure have been balanced, and depreciation fees and business taxes totaling 112,105,727 yuan have been paid to the state.

　　Establishing Normal Transportation Order, Taking the Initiative to Achieve Balanced Transportation
　　Railway staff members clearly realized that establishing normal transportation order and strengthening planned transportation on the basis of the basic resumption of traffic on national trunk lines is the central task for the whole year, which is the main reason for completing the plan. In the off-season of material exchange and seasonal slack periods, each railway bureau seized the time to load wagons, actively organized transportation, and solicited consignment from public and private enterprises, striving to load more goods. The Northeast, Taiyuan, and Tianjin Bureaus, through the local People's Government and Finance and Economics Committee, signed transportation contracts with various enterprise departments to ensure the timely completion of consignment plans and balanced transportation. For example, Northeast Railway has always been busy in winter and slack in summer. This year, the Northeast Special Commissioner's Office strived to transport more coal in the summer in order to balance winter and summer transportation tasks. In the second quarter alone, Northeast Coal and Iron Company increased the transportation of 60,000 tons of coal. The Tianjin Administration Bureau implemented freight collection upon arrival for private consignors within its jurisdiction, and adopted a bookkeeping method for miscellaneous fees of public enterprises, summarizing monthly, which solved the difficulty of cash flow for consignors. Since August, due to the reduction in freight rates and the adjustment of industry and commerce, both passenger and freight transport have improved.

　　Employees Display High Enthusiasm, Learn from Soviet Advanced Experience
　　Railway employees, combining high labor enthusiasm with learning from Soviet advanced experience, have achieved significant results in creating new records and breaking outdated operating standards in the past six months. For example, the freight car branch of the Huanggu Village Factory implemented an assembly line operation method for repairing freight cars. The average number of man-hours for overhaul was reduced from 67 to 55, the number of days in the factory was reduced from 29.5 days to 16.6 days, and oxygen consumption was reduced from more than 70 bottles to 50 bottles, which improved production efficiency and became a powerful guarantee for completing the production plan and thus enabling the people's railway to move towards the development stage.

　　However, at present, the serious deviations of "pursuing quantity and neglecting quality" and "completing tasks regardless of cost" are quite common in the national railway work. For example, in order to shorten the turnaround rate and increase the daily locomotive mileage, some places often run single locomotives (i.e., running without pulling vehicles). In June, a total of 2,489 single locomotives were run nationwide, wasting 8.7 percent of locomotive traction, and wasting more than 2,900 tons of coal alone. In order to complete tasks ahead of schedule, some railway factories desperately worked overtime, causing excessive fatigue for workers, harming the health of employees, and affecting the quality of production.

　　In order to strengthen economic accounting and correct the deviation of "pursuing numbers and neglecting quality," the Ministry of Railways of the Central People's Government has repeatedly instructed various railway bureaus to prevent pure task viewpoints and formalism tendencies, improve quality, consolidate existing achievements, and implement the idea of economic accounting. The instructions also pointed out that we should ideologically clearly recognize the direction of relying on the working class, carry out the democratic management movement, and make the railway work move forward further.

### 全国铁路运输走入正常  运输率比去年底增加百分之五十  追求数量忽视质量偏向亟应纠正

　　全国铁路运输走入正常
    运输率比去年底增加百分之五十
    追求数量忽视质量偏向亟应纠正
    【新华社二十六日讯】全国铁路今年上半年已从临时抢修阶段开始步入正常运输阶段。装车数达到原定半年计划的百分之一百零五点二，全国车辆周转率平均第一季实绩三点六八天，第二季实绩达二点九九天，较年度计划三点七二天均已缩短。全国铁路运输效率较去年年底增加了百分之五十。列车正点达百分之九十以上。今年一月至六月，全国以煤、粮、木材、盐、洋灰、棉花等为主，共运输货物四九、二三三、三五三吨，运送旅客七二、四九二、○○○人。机车日车公里平均提高到三二七公里，超过东北在伪满统治时期的最高标准二二九·四公里的百分之四十二·五。全国铁路工厂上半年生产量除机车因破损严重，完成计划百分之九十九点三外，客车完成计划百分之一百二十二，货车完成计划百分之一百零四。长辛店、唐山、石家庄、皇姑屯、江岸等十一个工厂，均完成计划。只有工程、工务、电务工作因计划订得过高，材料供应不及时等原因未能完成。但上半年桥梁永久复旧工程已完成全年任务的百分之七十四点四，即已超过计划。财务方面营业收入南、北方铁路完成半年计划的百分之九十七点七八，完成全年计划的百分之五十点六，超过全年收入的半数。铁路财政现金收支已能平衡，并交付国家折旧费及营业税共达一一二、一○五、七二七元。
    建立正常运输秩序  主动作到平衡运输
    铁路工作人员明确地认识了在全国干线基本恢复通车的基础上，建立正常运输秩序，加强计划运输为今年全年中心任务，这是完成计划的主要原因。在物资交流不畅及季节性的淡月中，各铁路局均抓紧装车主动组织运输，并招徕公私营企业托运，争取多装货物。东北、太原、天津各局通过当地人民政府和财经委员会，与各企业部门订立运输合同，保证托运计划如期完成及平衡运输。如东北铁路一向是冬运繁忙，夏运清淡。今年东北特派员办事处为了平衡冬夏运输任务，就争取夏季多运煤。第二季中仅东北煤铁公司就增运六万吨煤。天津管理局对管内私营货主实行到付运费，对公营企业的杂费采取记账办法，按月总结，解决了货主现金周转不灵的困难。八月以来，因运价减低及调整工商业后，客货运均呈好转。
    员工发挥高度热情  学习苏联先进经验
    铁路员工以高度劳动热情和学习苏联先进经验相结合，半年来在创造新纪录打破陈旧作业标准方面已获得重大成绩，如皇姑屯工厂货车分厂实行了修理货车的流水作业法，大修的平均工数由六十七工减少到五十五工，在厂日数由二十九点五天减少到十六点六天，氧气消耗由七十多瓶减少到五十瓶，使生产效率提高，成为完成生产计划从而使人民铁路走向发展阶段的有力保证。
    但目前全国铁路工作中相当普遍地存在着“追求数量，忽视质量”和“完成任务不计成本”的严重偏向。例如有些地方为缩短周转率和提高机车日车公里，时常加跑单机（即不拉车辆行走）。六月份全国共跑单机二千四百八十九次，浪费机车牵引力百分之八点七，仅燃煤即浪费两千九百多吨。有些铁路工厂为了提前完成任务，拚命加班加点，造成工人过度疲劳，伤害职工身体健康，影响生产质量的现象。
    中央人民政府铁道部为了加强经济核算和纠正“追求数字、忽视质量”的偏向，已一再指示各路局应防止单纯任务观点和形式主义倾向，提高质量，巩固现有成绩，贯彻经济核算思想。指示中并提出应从思想上明确认识依靠工人阶级的方向，开展民主管理运动，使铁路工作更前进一步。
