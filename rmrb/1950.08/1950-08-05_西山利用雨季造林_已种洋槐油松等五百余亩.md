　　Western Hills Utilizes Rainy Season for Afforestation
    Over 500 Mu Planted with Locust and Scotch Pine
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] News from the Beijing Municipal News Office: The Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government carried out afforestation through seeding and planting coniferous trees in the Elephant Trunk Gully area of the Western Hills in the suburbs of Beijing last month. The total area of the Western Hills is approximately 300,000 mu. Due to the indifference to the people's interests by the reactionary rulers of the past dynasties, the mountains and forests suffered destruction. Except for the scenic area of less than 5,000 mu in the valleys, the entire Western Hills has long been barren. This not only prevented the vast mountainous areas from producing timber, but also failed to conserve rainwater and prevent soil erosion from damaging nearby farmland and waterways, resulting in frequent droughts and floods in nearby farmland. In order to effectively change this situation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to gradually carry out afforestation work in the Western Hills from this year onwards with the assistance of the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government. As of July 23rd, a total of more than 500 mu of locust, ailanthus, vitex, scotch pine, and amorpha have been sown during this rainy season afforestation effort, and the digging of holes for planting 90,000 oriental arborvitae has also been completed. Before the work began, the local People's Government carried out publicity and mobilization work in the nearby villages. After initially understanding the importance of afforestation and forest protection, more than 200 farmers actively participated in this work, including as many as 60 women.

　　西山利用雨季造林
    已种洋槐油松等五百余亩
    【本报讯】京市新闻处消息：北京市人民政府郊区工作委员会上月份在京郊西山象鼻子沟一带进行荒山播种和针叶树植树造林。西山总面积约有三十万亩，由于过去历代反动统治者漠视人民利益，任令山林遭受破坏，整个西山除面积不到五千亩的山谷风景区外，久已全部荒秃。不但使广大山地未能生产木材，同时也不能积蓄雨水和防止山土淤损附近农田和河道，以致附近农田经常遭受旱灾和水灾。为了有效地改变这种情况，京市人民政府决自今年起在中央人民政府林垦部的协助下逐步开展西山造林工作。这次雨季造林截至七月二十三日止，共已播种洋槐、臭椿、荆条、油松、紫穗槐等五百余亩，准备种植九万株侧柏的挖穴工作亦已完成。在工作开始以前，当地人民政府在附近各村进行了宣传动员工作。农民们在初步懂得造林和护林的重要意义后，积极参加这项工作的已有二百余人，其中妇女多至六十余人。（毛庆德、袁平书）
