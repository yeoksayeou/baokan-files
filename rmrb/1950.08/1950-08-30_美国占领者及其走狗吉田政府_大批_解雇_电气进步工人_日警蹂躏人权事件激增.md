Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: The American occupiers of Japan and their lackey Yoshida government, after massively "dismissing" progressive journalists, have begun large-scale persecution of electrical workers. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo: On the 26th, the Japanese electrical industry "dismissed" 2,137 "Communists and their sympathizers." The Yoshida government's Labor Ministry shamelessly declared on the same day that these persecution measures were "legitimate," and threatened that if trade unions took resistance measures and engaged in struggle, they "would be considered to be violating the Labor Law and the Electrical Enterprise Law, and would be prosecuted."

At the same time, on the 25th, the Yoshida government's Ministry of Justice illegally disbanded the Communist Party branch of Toho Film Company and illegally "purged" 14 staff members of the branch. In Osaka, 15 progressive publications were subjected to the persecution of "indefinite suspension."

Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: Incidents of Japanese police violating human rights are increasing sharply. According to a Tokyo broadcast on the 22nd: The number of complaints received by the Ministry of Justice's "Human Rights Protection Bureau" regarding police violations of human rights surged to 5,000 last year, compared to 48 the previous year. By the end of June this year, the number of such incidents had reached 2,200. However, the Ministry of Justice is doing everything possible to protect the tyrannical police. Of the thousands of complaints, only 180 were found to be valid and "investigated" last year, and 200 in the first half of this year. The Ministry of Justice admitted that "a considerable number" of people who have been violated are afraid to complain.

　　美国占领者及其走狗吉田政府
    大批“解雇”电气进步工人
    日警蹂躏人权事件激增
    【新华社二十九日讯】日本的美国占领者及其走狗吉田政府，在大批“解雇”进步的新闻工作者以后，又开始大规模迫害电气工人。据路透社东京讯：日本电气产业于二十六日“解雇”了二千一百三十七名“共产党员及其同路人”。吉田政府劳工省于当日无耻地声称这种迫害措施是“正当的”，并威胁地说：工会若采取抗争的手段，进行斗争，“将被认为是违犯劳工法及电气事业法，而加以检举”。
    与此同时，吉田政府法务府于二十五日非法解散东宝电影公司的共产党支部，并非法“整肃”该支部工作人员十四名。在大阪，又有十五种进步刊物遭受“无限期停刊”的迫害。
    【新华社二十九日讯】日本警察蹂躏人权的事件，大量增加。据东京二十二日广播：法务府“人权拥护局”所受理的关于警察蹂躏人权的控告案件，去年激增至五千件，而前年则为四十八件。今年截至六月底为止，此种事件已达二千二百件。但是，法务府对横暴的警察实行百般袒护，在数千件控告案中，经被确定控告成立而进行“查究”的，去年仅一百八十件，今年上半年为二百件。法务府承认：遭受蹂躏后因畏惧而不敢控告者“为数不少”。
