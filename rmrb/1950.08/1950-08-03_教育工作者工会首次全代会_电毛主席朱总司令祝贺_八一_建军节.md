　　Educational Workers' Union First National Congress
    Cables Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to Congratulate "August 1st" Army Day
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The First National Congress of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union cabled Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army on "August 1st" to extend congratulations. The cable reads as follows: To Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army:
    As the First National Congress of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union convenes in the people's capital—Beijing—coinciding with the Army Day of our People's Liberation Army, we, on behalf of educational workers nationwide, extend to you our highest respect and warmest congratulations, for it is due to the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Liberation Army that the Chinese people have been able to achieve such a great victory today. In the future, to consolidate the victories already won, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits, and liberate Tibet and Taiwan, we must still rely on the efforts of the People's Liberation Army. We deeply know that any attempt by the imperialists to obstruct the liberation of Taiwan will inevitably be met with a crushing blow by our People's Liberation Army. This paper tiger of American imperialism has long been exposed by the brave people's fighters of China and Korea. We call on educational workers nationwide to educate young people to love the motherland, to love the people's fighters who defend the motherland, and to take this as a gift to welcome the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Tibet and Taiwan and the complete victory of the Chinese revolution.
          Respectfully, from all representatives of the First National Congress of the Chinese Educational Workers' Union.
                  August 1st
