Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing: The Nanjing Municipal People's Government has actively increased revenue and saved on expenditures, enabling the city to achieve a balanced fiscal budget in the first half of the year, reversing the previous situation of deficits. According to statistics from the Municipal Finance Bureau, the revenue exceeded expenditure by over 10 billion yuan from January to June this year.

During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, Nanjing was a deformed consumer city with numerous and bloated bureaucratic institutions, always incurring fiscal deficits. After Nanjing was liberated in April last year, the People's Government could not completely change the situation of deficits in the early stage of taking over. From May to September, the ratio of fiscal revenue to expenditure in the city was 1:5. Although it improved slightly from October to December, it still only reached a ratio of 3:4, with the shortfall relying entirely on subsidies from the Central Government.

After the Central People's Government unified national financial and economic work this spring, the Nanjing Municipal People's Government further strived for a balanced budget based on the principle of "considering both the needs of the people and the availability of resources, collecting reasonably, and using appropriately." In recent months, the primary focus has been on rectifying urban tax work, controlling major tax sources, and preventing tax evasion, thereby overfulfilling the tax revenue task for the first half of the year and ensuring national fiscal revenue, enabling the city's fiscal budget to be realized. Secondly, all financial and economic departments have conscientiously cleared out materials, with materials cleared out contributing 330 million yuan towards expenses or being converted into inventory at value. At the same time, the Municipal People's Government implemented streamlining work and continued to carry out the savings movement. For example, the actual expenditure of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court in April and May was 27% less than the original budget. Many organs have handed over part of their surplus grain and labor production income to the public, with 140,000 jin of rice collected just after the unification of financial and economic work.

　　整顿城市税收  贯彻整编节约
    南京上半年财政无赤字
    收支相抵后尚结余百亿余元
    【本报讯】据新华社南京电：南京市人民政府积极增加收入，节省支出，已使上半年的财政收支达到平衡，扭转了过去入不敷出的现象。据市财政局统计，今年一至六月收支相抵，尚结余百余亿元。
    南京市在国民党反动统治时期是一个畸形的消费城市，官僚机构众多而臃肿，财政上从来入不敷出。去年四月南京市解放后，人民政府在接管初期一时还不能彻底改变入不敷出的现象。自五月至九月全市财政收支为一与五之比，十月至十二月虽稍好转，但仍只能达到三与四之比，不敷之数全赖中央补贴。
    今春中央人民政府统一全国财经工作后，南京市人民政府乃进一步根据“量出为人与量入为出兼顾，取之合理，用之得当”的原则，力争收支平衡。数月来，首先是整顿了城市税收工作，掌握主要税源，防止偷漏，因而超额完成了今年上半年税收任务，保证国家财政收入，使该市财政概算得以实现。其次，是各财经部门都认真清理了物资，清理出的物资抵作开支或变价入库者共三亿三千余万元。同时市人民政府贯彻执行了整编工作和继续开展节约运动。如南京市人民法院四、五两月的实际开支，较原预算节省百分之二十七。许多机关将节余食米及劳动生产所得的一部交公，仅在财经工作统一后即有十四万斤大米。
