　　Leading Organs Only Issue General Calls, Lacking Inspection
    Rural Grassroots Organizations in Taiping County Urgently Need Rectification
    [Our Anhui South News] Zhao Jiezhong, Deputy Secretary of the Communist Youth League Work Committee of Taiping County, Chizhou Prefecture, reports: The leading organs of the county only issue general calls for rectifying rural grassroots organizations, lacking specific guidance and inspection. At present, there is a serious phenomenon of impurity in the rural grassroots organizations of the county, which hinders the promotion of various tasks and urgently needs to be rectified. There are a total of eighty-two administrative villages in Taiping County. After liberation last year, through movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, rent reduction, and production to overcome famine, the pseudo-bao-jia system was destroyed, and activists in the movements were trained and absorbed to establish rural grassroots organizations. From the form, the village administration and various mass organizations in Taiping County have been established, but in reality, there is a serious phenomenon of impurity in the organizations of some villages. Some are directly controlled by landlords, and some are indirectly controlled. Some honest peasants said: When the Kuomintang was in power, they were bao chiefs; when the Communist Party came, they were village chiefs. No matter who comes, they can still get by. For example, in Heping Village, Xianyuan District, the chairman of the farmers' association is a former pseudo-bao chief, the organization committee member of the farmers' association is a small landlord who rents out forty mu of land, and the propaganda, education, and civil affairs committee members are all former pseudo-government personnel, and most of them rely on renting out land for a living. Sun Zhiyu, a landlord in Xiange Village, was a quartermaster in the reactionary army and also served as a bao chief before liberation. After liberation, he became the village chief and monopolized everything. He completely controlled the reasonable burden and rent reduction work. Zhang Baoxiang, the deputy village chief of Nanguan Village, embezzled more than 37,000 jin of public grain.
    Another situation is that the farmers' associations in some villages exist in name only and rarely hold meetings to discuss work. Many members of Xitan Village do not know who their group leaders are. Yansi Village organized a women's association, but a few cadres only created a roster and submitted it to the higher authorities, and wrote down those with unclear political backgrounds or children.
    The reason for the impurity of rural grassroots organizations is that, on the one hand, landlords and bad elements deliberately take advantage of loopholes, and on the other hand, the county's leading organs lack specific inspection and guidance. In order to conduct land reform in an orderly manner with leadership after the autumn harvest this year and to consolidate and strengthen the ranks of farmers, this is a problem that the county leadership urgently needs to solve.

### 领导机关只作一般号召缺乏检查  太平县农村基层组织亟待整顿

　　领导机关只作一般号召缺乏检查
    太平县农村基层组织亟待整顿
    【本报皖南讯】池州专区太平县青年团工作委员会副书记赵杰中报道：该县领导机关对整顿农村基层组织，只作一般号召，缺乏具体指导与检查。目前该县农村基层组织存在着严重不纯现象，阻碍着各种工作的推行，亟需加以整顿。太平县全县共八十二个行政村。去年解放后，经过剿匪、反霸、减租、生产度荒等运动，摧毁了伪保甲制度，并训练和吸收了运动中的积极分子，建立了农村基层组织。从形式上看，太平县的村政权及各种群众团体的组织是建立起来了，但实际上有些村子的各种组织存在着严重的不纯现象。有的被地主直接掌握，有的被间接掌握。有些老实农民说：国民党在时当保长，共产党来当村长，甭管谁来，他们还是吃得开。如仙源区和平村，农会主任是伪保长，农会组织委员是出租四十亩地的小地主，宣传、教育、民政委员都是伪府人员，且多依靠出租土地为生。弦歌村地主孙志玉，解放前在反动军队中当军需官，又当过保长。解放后当上村长，一手遮天，在合理负担和减租等工作中，完全由他一个掌握。南关村副村长张保祥，贪污公粮三万七千余斤。
    另一种情况是，部分村庄的农会有名无实，很少开会讨论工作。西潭村不少会员都不知道自己的小组长是谁。岩寺村组织妇女会，只是几个干部造名册呈送上级，并把政治面目不清的或小孩子都写上了。
    农村基层组织不纯的原因，一方面是地主、坏蛋有意钻空子，另外县领导机关缺乏具体检查与指导。为了使今年秋后的土地改革能够有领导有秩序的进行，巩固和壮大农民队伍，这是该县领导上亟需解决的一个问题。
