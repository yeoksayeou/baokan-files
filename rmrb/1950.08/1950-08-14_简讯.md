　　Jilin Railway Bureau Conducts Pilot Work on Rationalization Proposals
　　Since the Jilin Railway Bureau implemented rationalization proposals last winter, it has achieved great results in completing production tasks and improving labor organization. However, there are still many problems in leadership that hinder the development of the rationalization proposal movement. After a pilot project at the Jilin Machinery Plant, twelve days of experience proved that only by granting the grassroots rationalization proposal committee full authority can this work be better carried out.

　　People's Bank of China Yuci Special Office: Some Experiences in Providing Grain Loans to Disaster Areas
　　The Yuci Special Office of the People's Bank of China issued 371,000 jin of grain loans to disaster victims in eight counties, including Meng County, which were severely affected by the disaster, to help them replant and rush planting. Several experiences from this loan are: (1) Disaster area loans must be strictly distinguished from disaster relief. Loans are to assist production. (2) Loans should be timely and quick, and should not be waited for or shirked, and should be combined with work such as appeasement, condolences, and relief to overcome the pessimistic and disappointed emotions of the masses. (3) The loan area should not be too broad, and the area should be determined with emphasis to facilitate control. (Yuci Office Cooperation Stock Communication Group)

　　Xingtang Dong?? Village Branch Education: Great Results by Connecting with Reality
　　In Dong?? Village, Xingtang County, Hebei, the branch achieved great results in branch education by connecting with work and connecting with thoughts. Before the education, the branch explained the problems existing in the thoughts of the party members and combined them with documents, conducted group discussions, and launched criticism and self-criticism. A party member said: "This can be remembered and progress is fast." For example, Yang Zeng of Mu Village used to work in the district, but he went home because of his lack of ideological progress, and no one in the village looked up to him. The branch used this example to educate everyone to be revolutionary to the end.

　　Zhengzhou Station Does Not Rely on the Masses: Responsibility Accidents Increase Accordingly
　　The Zhengzhou Station Joint Labor Group had six responsibility accidents in June. During the accident elimination campaign week from July 1 to 7, there was another near-miss siding accident. After the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau helped the station leadership conduct an inspection, it was found that the main reason for the accident was that the station leaders lacked a mass viewpoint. They excessively believed in the mobilizing role of the leadership and failed to deeply mobilize and rely on the masses. If things are not done well, they complain that the masses are not conscious enough, so that the leadership's intentions cannot be combined with the actions of the masses. The idea of ​​not relying on the masses is also manifested in the fact that the Management Committee has only held three meetings since its establishment last year and has not played any role; the rationalization proposals put forward by the joint labor team have not been resolved in a timely manner, so that many workers are unwilling to make suggestions. After the review, it was decided to start with improving the Management Committee and strive to overcome the above shortcomings. (Shen Zhi)
　　Kailuan Mine Qinhuangdao Office: Production Competition Has Deviations
　　Since the Kailuan Coal Mine Qinhuangdao Office launched the production saving and model creation competition in early June, it has made many achievements in improving production efficiency and saving labor and materials, but there are also serious shortcomings that need to be improved: (1) The leadership lags behind the development of the movement and fails to summarize and promote experience in a timely manner, falling into the quagmire of bureaucracy. (2) Simply increasing labor intensity and prolonging working hours has a great impact on workers' health, resulting in increased accidents. In the first half of June alone, there were more than ten minor and serious work-related injuries. (3) Due to the large old organization, inconsistent steps, and mutual restraint, each unit failed to fully exert its effectiveness.

　　Lin Dingxi Creates Artificial Drying Method: Glass Production Will Increase Accordingly
　　Lin Dingxi, deputy engineer of the kiln of the Qinhuangdao Joint State-Private Yaohua Glass Factory, invented an artificial drying method with the assistance of workers. The drying time for large No. 30 type bricks and crucibles made of fire clay can be shortened from three to four months to fifteen days, and there will be no more cracking or deformation. These large boat-shaped bricks and crucibles made of fire clay occupy a very important position in the glass manufacturing process. In the past, they often could not meet the needs of glass production because the drying time required for their manufacture was too long, and their poor quality also directly affected the quality of the glass. The new method has completely solved this problem, and the output and quality of glass can be greatly improved as a result.

　　吉林铁路局进行合理化建议试点工作
    吉林铁路局自去冬推行合理化建议以来，在完成生产任务与改进劳动组织上，虽然收到很大的成效，但在领导工作上还存在着许多问题，阻碍了合理化建议运动的发展。经过在吉林机械场的试点工作，十二天的经验证明：只有赋予基层合理化建议委员会以充分职权，才能使这一工作得到更好的开展。

　　人民银行榆专办事处  灾区贷粮的一些经验
    人民银行榆次专区办事处发出贷粮三十七万一千斤，给受灾严重的孟县等八县的灾民，扶助他们进行补种、抢种。从这次贷放中得出的几点经验是：（一）灾区贷放必须和灾区救济严格区分开来，贷放是扶助生产的。（二）贷放要及时、迅速，不宜等待、推诿，并结合安抚、慰问、救济等工作，以克服群众悲观失望的情绪。（三）贷放面不能过于宽广，应有重点地确定地区，便于掌握。（榆办合作股通讯小组）

　　行唐东??村支部教育  联系实际收效很大
    河北行唐县东??村在支部教育中，由于联系工作，联系思想，进行教育，所以收效很大。教育之前，支部把党员思想上存在的问题和文件结合进行讲解，分组讨论，展开批评与自我批评。党员说：“这样能记住，进步快。”又如木村杨增过去在区里工作，因为思想不进步回家了，村里谁也看不起。支部便用这个例子来教育大家要革命到底。

　　郑州站不依靠群众  责任事故因之增多
    郑州车站联合劳动组六月份发生六件责任事故，在七月一日至七日消灭事故运动周中，又险出挤岔事故。经郑州路局帮助该站领导进行检查，发现造成事故的主要原因，是该站领导干部缺乏群众观点。过分相信领导的号召作用，没有深入发动和依靠群众。事情做不好，反而埋怨群众觉悟不高，以致使领导意图不能与群众行动相结合。不依靠群众的思想，还表现在：管委会自去年成立后，只开过三次会，没有发挥任何作用；联合劳动小组提出的合理化建议，也没有及时得到解决，以致许多工人都不愿提意见。经检讨后，决定先从健全管委会着手，针对以上缺点，努力克服。（沈志）
　　开滦矿秦皇岛办事处  生产竞赛发生偏向
    开滦煤矿秦皇岛办事处全体职工，自六月初开展生产节约创模竞赛运动以来，在提高生产效率，节工省料等方面虽有不少成绩，但也存在着急待改进的严重缺点：（一）领导落后于运动的发展，未及时总结推广经验，陷入事务主义的泥坑。（二）单纯增加劳动强度，延长工时，对工人健康影响甚大，因而事故增加。在六月份上半月中，轻重公伤有十余人之多。（三）由于旧机构庞大，步调不一致，互相牵制，各单位未能充分发挥效能。

　　林定喜创人工干燥法  玻璃生产将随之提高
    秦皇岛市公私合营耀华玻璃厂大窑副工程师林定喜，在工人协助下，发明人工干燥法，火土制造的大型卅型砖和?子，可将三至四个月的干燥时间缩短为十五天，且不再有龟裂或变形现象。这种用火土制造的大型舟型砖和?子，在玻璃的制造过程中，占有极重要地位。过去常因其制造时所需干燥时间太长，以致供应不上玻璃生产的需要，又因其质量不好，也直接影响到玻璃的质量。新的方法已完全解决了这个问题，玻璃的产量、质量，均可因此大大提高。
