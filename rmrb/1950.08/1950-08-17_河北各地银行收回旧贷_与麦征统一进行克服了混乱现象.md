　　Banks in Hebei Province Recover Old Loans; Unified with Wheat Collection to Overcome Confusion
　　[Report from Baoding by this newspaper] In order to accelerate capital turnover and increase the strength of supporting mass re-production, the People's Bank of China, Hebei Province, and its branches are seizing the favorable conditions after the wheat harvest to launch a comprehensive collection effort. As of mid-July, incomplete statistics from various bank branches in the province show that 21,560,000 jin of wheat have been recovered, accounting for more than 65 percent of the planned recovery of 33,000,000 jin.
　　During the collection process, this year the government uniformly made arrangements from above so that wheat collection and the recovery of various grain loans were carried out simultaneously. This saved time for governments at all levels, especially district and village governments, and overcame the chaotic phenomenon of collecting taxes today, recovering loans tomorrow, and then exchanging coarse grains for fine grains the day after. This reduced administrative work for cadres and reduced trouble and saved time for the masses.
　　The methods used were also more flexible. In addition to handing over wheat, farmers could also hand over other types of grain, which were fairly converted according to market prices, or they could hand over currency. In some areas, the distance to the grain collection site was far, making it difficult for the masses to hand over grain. The bank first consulted with the grain department, and borrowers could hand over grain to the grain department, receive a receipt, and go to the bank to clear their accounts. This also provided a lot of convenience for the collection work.

　　河北各地银行收回旧贷
    与麦征统一进行克服了混乱现象
    【本报保定讯】中国人民银行河北省各地行处，为加速资金周转，增加扶植群众再生产的力量，抓紧在麦收后的有利条件，展开了全面的催收工作。截至七月中旬，省内各行处不完全的统计，已收回小麦二千一百五十六万斤，占计划收回数三千三百万斤的百分之六十五强。
    在催收中由于今年是由政府统一向下布置，使麦征和收回各种贷粮同时进行，节省了各级政府特别是区、村政府的时间，克服了今天征收、明天收贷、后天再收以粗换细的混乱现象，减少了干部的事务性，对群众也减少麻烦并省时间。
    在方式上也较灵活，农民除交麦子外，也可交他种粮食，按市价公平折算或交货币。有的地区距收粮地较远，群众交粮困难，银行曾先向粮食部门洽商，贷户可向粮食部门交粮，领回收据，到银行销账。这也给予催收工作不少方便。
