Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) issued a "Decision on Conscientiously Implementing the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's Directive on Developing Workers' Spare-Time Education" on July 13th. This decision requires trade union organizations at all levels of regions and industries to, based on this directive from the Government Administration Council, assign specific personnel to be responsible for this work; to proactively discuss with local People's Government education departments and other relevant parties, to rapidly organize workers' spare-time education committees in various localities, and to draft implementation plans tailored to the specific circumstances of the localities, so as to submit them to higher-level trade union organizations for record-keeping, and to strive to complete the tasks on schedule in an organized, planned, and step-by-step manner. In regions, factories, and mines where production competitions are being carried out, trade union organizations at all levels of regions and industries should include workers' spare-time education, which aims to improve workers' cultural and technical levels, as a specific part of establishing collective contracts and formulating production competition plans, so that workers' spare-time education will not be halted due to the production competition, but can instead promote the development of the movement. The aforementioned decision also requires trade unions in various localities to prevent and overcome two tendencies: one is to relax organizational leadership, thereby allowing workers' spare-time education to drift; the other is to fail to conduct work based on the principle of workers' voluntary participation, but instead to adopt a mandatory approach, causing formalism in this work. As for the organizational regulations and working regulations of the workers' spare-time education committees at all levels, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is currently drafting them.

　　全总要求各级工会
    认真开展职工业余教育
    【新华社三十一日讯】中华全国总工会于七月十三日发出“关于认真执行中央人民政府政务院开展职工业余教育指示的决定”。该决定要求各级地区和产业工会组织根据政务院这个指示，确定专人负责这一工作；主动地与当地人民政府教育部门及其他有关方面进行商讨，迅速地把各地的职工业余教育委员会组织起来，并拟出切合于当地具体情况的实施计划，以便交上级工会组织备案后，有组织、有计划、有步骤地争取按期完成任务。在进行生产竞赛的地区、厂矿中，各级地区及产业工会组织，应把提高职工文化水平和技术水平的职工业余教育，列为订立集体合同与制订生产竞赛计划的具体内容之一，使职工业余教育不致因进行生产竞赛而停顿，反而可以推进运动的开展。上述决定并要求各地工会防止和克服两种偏向：一是放松组织领导因而使职工业余教育工作自流；一是不根据职工群众自觉自愿原则去进行工作，而是采取强迫命令方式，使这一工作发生形式主义偏向。至于各级职工业余教育委员会的组织条例和工作条例，全国总工会现正草拟中。
