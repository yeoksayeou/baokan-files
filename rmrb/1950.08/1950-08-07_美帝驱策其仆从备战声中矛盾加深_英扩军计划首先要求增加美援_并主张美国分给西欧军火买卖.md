Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Amidst the United States' continuous intensification of pressure to coerce its Western European vassal states to actively expand their military and prepare for war, the British Labour government announced on the 4th a massive military expansion plan for Britain, involving an expenditure of 3.4 billion pounds over the next three years. This plan was first directly communicated to the US government by the British government in the form of a memorandum on the 3rd before it was announced to the British public, openly admitting that the plan was drafted in response to the "request" of the United States. According to the new plan, the British government's average annual military expenditure will reach more than 1.1 billion pounds in the future, an increase of 45 percent compared to the current 780 million pounds per year. According to the memorandum: "This means that the government is prepared to increase the total military expenditure from about 8 percent of the national income to 10 percent."
    Therefore, this huge war preparation plan will increase the heavy burden on the British people. Reuters quoted British government experts as saying: "The result of a large increase in military expenditure will return Britain to a life of hardship." The Telegraph Agency further pointed out that London newspapers have announced that this plan will bring further austerity and wage freezes, greater shortages of consumer goods, and higher prices. The memorandum also had to acknowledge the painful fate that Britain could not escape due to the preparation for an intensified war of aggression. It said: "The implementation of this three-year plan will cause Britain to lose exports due to the repayment of necessary US dollars and other imported goods, and suffer serious losses due to reduced urgent domestic investment."
    The memorandum also stated: The British government is using this opportunity to request assistance from the United States. The memorandum emphasized: "If Britain does not receive substantial assistance from the United States in addition to the European Recovery Program (i.e., the Marshall Plan), it will not be able to implement the entire plan." The memorandum specifically stated: "If the British government does not receive financial assistance from the United States, it will not be able to fully transfer British production resources to military use as instructed by the US government." "If Britain's arms production is increased with US assistance, the British government suggests that Britain supply various military equipment produced by Britain to the North Atlantic countries." That is to say, only if the United States gives money to supply Britain's arms industry and shares some of the United States' arms deals in Western Europe with British arms dealers will Britain be willing to increase arms production.
    The conditions put forward by the British government once again prove that every step taken by US imperialism to intensify its coercion of its vassal states to prepare for war inevitably deepens the contradictions between them.

### 美帝驱策其仆从备战声中矛盾加深  英扩军计划首先要求增加美援  并主张美国分给西欧军火买卖

　　美帝驱策其仆从备战声中矛盾加深
    英扩军计划首先要求增加美援
    并主张美国分给西欧军火买卖
    【新华社六日讯】在美国不断加强压力以胁迫其西欧仆从国家积极扩军备战声中，英国工党政府已在四日发表了英国准备在今后三年中耗费三十四亿英镑的庞大扩军计划。该计划系于三日经英国政府以备忘录形式直接通知美国政府后，始向英国民众公布，其中公然承认该计划系应美国的“要求”而拟定。按照新计划，英国政府今后每年平均军费将达十一亿英镑以上，较目前的每年七亿八千万英镑增加百分之四十五。据备忘录称：“这就意味着政府准备把军费总额从国民收入的大约百分之八，提高到百分之十。”
    因此，这一庞大的备战计划将使英国人民增加沉重的负担。路透社即曾引英国政府专家说：“大大增加军费的结果将使英国回到刻苦的生活水准”。电通社更指出，伦敦各报都宣布这个计划会带来进一步的节约与工资冻结，消费品更加缺少与物价更加高涨。备忘录也不能不承认英国因加强侵略战争的准备而无法逃避的痛苦命运。它说：“实现这个三年计划将使英国因偿付必需的美元及其他入口货而丧失出口，减少迫切的国内投资而蒙受严重的损失。”
    备忘录同时又表示：英国政府正利用这一机会要求美国给以援助。备忘录强调声明：“英国如得不到美国在欧洲复兴计划（即马歇尔计划）以外的大量援助，即不能实行全部计划”。备忘录特别提出：“英国政府如得不到美国给予财政援助，即不能依照美政府所示，使英国生产资源充分转为军用。”“英国的军火增产，如得到美国援助，英国政府建议由英国以英国所产各种军用装备，供应北大西洋各国。”这就是说，只有美国给钱供应英国的军火工业，并把美国在西欧的军火买卖分一部分给英国军火商做，英国才肯增产军火。
    英国政府所提出的这些条件又一次证明了美帝国主义加紧驱策其仆从国家进行备战的每一个步骤，都不可避免地加深着他们内部之间的矛盾。
