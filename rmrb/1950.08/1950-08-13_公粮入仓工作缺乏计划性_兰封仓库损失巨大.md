　　Lack of Planning in Public Grain Storage
　　Lanfeng Warehouse Suffers Huge Losses
To the Editors:
　　Chenliu Special District of Henan Province built a warehouse in Lanfeng city this spring (totaling 180 rooms), planning to store 8 million jin of public grain from Qi County and Kaocheng County this summer. Calculated at a rate of 800,000 jin of grain received per day, the storage task could be completed within ten days.
　　On July 11th, farmers from Kaocheng County began to deliver public grain to the warehouse first. However, due to insufficient communication between the warehouse负责人 [responsible person] and Kaocheng County, and improper planning, grain-delivering masses began arriving in Lanfeng County as early as the 9th. On the 11th, it rained, and the newly built warehouse leaked, preventing the grain from being stored. An order was issued to suspend grain collection for two days. This left approximately 2,200 large and small carts, 6,300 livestock, and over 8,000 laborers from Kaocheng carrying 2 million jin of wheat waiting in Lanfeng County.
　　On the 13th, the warehouse held a cadre meeting. Due to differing opinions, no concrete plan, clear division of labor, or emergency measures were formulated amidst this chaotic situation. The 8,000 grain-delivering farmers were left waiting for public grain to be stored from the 9th to the 18th. Many drank cold water from wells when thirsty and slept in the open at night, while the cadres turned a blind eye to the plight of the farmers. We know of over a dozen people who fell ill as a result, and livestock died due to insufficient fodder.
　　Due to continuous rainy weather, from the 9th to the 18th, the warehouse only stored 230,000 jin of grain (the leaders of Kaocheng County did not seriously check the quality of the public grain, resulting in most of the grain received being damp, some infested with insects, and some mixed with mud; coupled with the rain, farmers delivered 3 million jin of grain, but only this amount was accepted). The remaining 1.77 million jin of grain had to be hauled back by the farmers. The closest grain-delivering farmers from Kaocheng County are 50 li from Lanfeng city, and the farthest are 100 li. The total transportation cost wastage is approximately 140,000 jin of grain, and the waste of labor and the losses from the rain damage to the grain are incalculable.

### 公粮入仓工作缺乏计划性  兰封仓库损失巨大

　　公粮入仓工作缺乏计划性
    兰封仓库损失巨大编者同志：
    河南省陈留专署今春在兰封城内修建仓库一座（共一百八十间），计划今年夏征可收存杞县、考城两县公粮八百万斤。每天以收粮八十万斤计算，十天内即可完成入仓任务。
    七月十一日开始由考城县农民先行送缴公粮入库。但仓库负责人和考城县因联系不够，计划不当，致使缴粮群众在九日即陆续到达兰封县。十一日天雨，新建仓库漏水，公粮不能入仓，即下令暂停两天再开始收粮。使得从考城运到的二百万斤麦子，约计大车小车二千二百余辆，牲口六千三百余头，民工八千余人，在兰封县城里等待。
    十三日仓库召开干部会议，由于大家意见不同，也未能在此混乱情况下，订出具体计划，明确分工，采取紧急措施。使八千送粮农民，从九日到十八日一直等待公粮入库，许多人渴了就喝井里的冷水，夜间露宿，而干部对农民这种处境却熟视无睹。据我们所知道有十几人因此生病；牲畜因草料不足，发生死亡的现象。
    由于连天阴雨，从九日至十八日九天中，该库只收了二十三万斤粮入库（考城县领导上没有认真检查公粮成色，以致所收粮食绝大部分是潮湿的，有的生了虫，有的夹着泥土，再加以天雨，农民送来三百万斤粮食，结果只验收了此数），余下的一百七十七万斤粮只得由农民拉回去。按考城县缴粮农民离兰封城最近者为五十里，远者一百里。全部运费损耗约十四万斤粮食，人力浪费，粮食遭雨淋的损失就无法计算了。
