　　Northeast Railway Labor Heroes Issue Statements
    Resolving to Answer U.S. Imperialist Provocations with Practical Actions
    Sino-Soviet Railway Bureau Trade Union Holds Symposium Denouncing U.S. Imperialist Atrocities

    [Reported by this newspaper] Northeast Railway Special-Grade Labor Heroes Du Xianyang, Xing Xudong, Shi Kun, Labor Hero Li Yongjiu and others have telephoned this newspaper, expressing their great indignation at the U.S. imperialist military aircraft's intrusion into our country's airspace and the killing of our people, and expressing their resolve to take practical action to support the People's Liberation Army in expelling the U.S. aggressors.

    Du Xianyang
    Du Xianyang, flag-bearer of the Northeast Railway Iron Ox Movement and Special-Grade Labor Hero, said in a telegram to this newspaper: U.S. imperialism has reached its dying stage, and is struggling madly before its death. This time, it unreasonably invaded our country's sacred airspace, brazenly damaged our locomotives, and strafed our workers. We are not afraid of this brutal behavior at all. No matter how mad and brutal it is, we know that it is an out-and-out paper tiger. In the future, we must strengthen our work, ensure the completion of our tasks, and answer the atrocities of U.S. imperialism with practical actions.

    Xing Xudong
    Xing Xudong, Northeast Region Special-Grade Labor Hero and Deputy Stationmaster of Harbin Station, stated in a telegram to this newspaper on August 30th: After hearing the news of U.S. imperialist aircraft invading our Northeast airspace and strafing our people, the workers of our Harbin Station felt extremely indignant. I represent more than 900 workers at Harbin Station in expressing our firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest and our firm opposition to the killing and wounding of our peaceful residents and worker brothers by U.S. aircraft, as well as the destruction of our buildings, stations, and vehicles. We want to tell the U.S. imperialists: The Chinese people have stood up under the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, and we will never allow such acts of aggression; Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest represents the firm will of all the Chinese people. The Chinese people will use unparalleled strength to give the provocateurs a thorough blow, defend our national sovereignty and independence, and ensure lasting world peace. Our railway workers are determined to eliminate accidents, ensure the completion of production tasks, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan as soon as possible and expelling the invaders.

    Shi Kun
    Shi Kun, Special-Grade Labor Hero of the Northeast Linkou Locomotive Depot, expressed his opinion: We must never give in to the lawless atrocities of U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism has been routed by the Korean People's Army and is now invading our airspace and carrying out atrocities. We cannot tolerate this. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and will turn our indignation into strength, using practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army and liberate Taiwan as soon as possible.

    Li Yongjiu
    Li Yongjiu, Labor Hero and Deputy Director of the Harbin Locomotive Depot, said: The final struggle of U.S. imperialism will ultimately not escape the palm of the people's hand. It has been defeated by the Korean people and is now invading our country. The Chinese people will absolutely not allow this brutal behavior, this provocation that attempts to expand the war and disrupt world peace. In order to defend our motherland, we are determined to complete the eight-month production and financial plan, launch the 500-kilometer locomotive movement, and prepare sufficient strength to smash the invaders into mincemeat!

    [Reported by this newspaper] Advanced producers, engineering and technical personnel, staff, and women representatives of the Northeast Sino-Soviet Railway Bureau held a symposium under the leadership of the trade union on the afternoon of the 29th. The participants expressed extreme indignation at the atrocities of U.S. imperialism in invading our airspace and killing and wounding our people. Yang Wanli, an advanced worker from the engineering department, said: "This time, the atrocities of U.S. aircraft are intolerable. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and demand that the U.S. government compensate for the losses. We must also strengthen publicity and be vigilant against saboteurs spreading rumors." Wang Zhankui from the finance department, Tang Yanzhi from the business department, Gong Xuezeng from the factory affairs department, and Li Wanchun from the political department also spoke successively. All unanimously stated: determined to take practical actions to improve production and complete the third-quarter financial plan ahead of schedule, to defeat the unreasonable provocations of U.S. imperialism. All the employees attending the meeting also guaranteed to do five things: (1) Carry out propaganda to employees and their families to expose the crimes of U.S. imperialism; (2) Write letters to express sympathy for the injured worker brothers; (3) Launch the formulation of production and financial plans; (4) Send a telegram to tell our compatriots across the country of our indignant mood, and call on everyone to unite to protest against U.S. imperialist aggression.
