Beijing News Agency Report: The Beijing People's Court recently sentenced four embezzlement cases. The main offenders in each case, Gong Binnan, Gao Shun, Feng Zhanxiang, Li Rongkai, Sun Jingu, and Zhang Baoxiang, were all sentenced to imprisonment for embezzling public funds by taking advantage of their positions.

　　Gong Binnan was an accountant at the Beijing Public Trust Company. He used his position to steal a blank check from the company on May 7th, and forged the official and responsible persons' seals to fraudulently obtain a huge amount of public funds from the bank, totaling 13 million yuan. After the trial, he was sentenced to eight years in prison.

　　Gao Shun, Feng Zhanxiang, and Li Rongkai previously served as the director, purchasing agent, and accountant of the Guandongdian Village Cooperative in the eastern suburbs. Since the cooperative began operations in December of last year, the three conspired to embezzle funds, causing the cooperative to lose the equivalent of 5,789 jin of corn, leading to its closure. Gao Shun also destroyed accounting books and violently resisted superiors' inspection of accounts. In addition to sentencing Gao Shun to three years in prison, and Feng Zhanxiang and Li Rongkai to ten months each, the People's Court, in order to prevent losses to the members of the cooperative, ordered the defendants to be responsible for compensating the shortfall of 1,504 jin of corn in share capital.

　　Sun Jingu was a clerk at the No. 70 Ordnance Factory of the Heavy Industry Ministry's Ordnance Bureau. Since February of this year, he embezzled a total of 1,216,795 yuan in people's currency from the mess fund and 23,100 yuan from the June union group fee. On July 10th, unable to account for the money, he falsely reported to his superiors that 1 million yuan was lost. The trial resulted in a sentence of two years and six months in prison.

　　Zhang Baoxiang was a clerk at the Baotou Post Office in Suiyuan. Using his position, he privately retrieved three packages containing drugs for drug dealers and three packages containing nine bottles of acetic acid for another person. Apart from other accomplices, he alone obtained a total of 65 silver dollars in two instances and fled to Beijing on May 23rd of this year. He was arrested by the Fourth Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau and sent to the court, which sentenced him to two years in prison and fined him 500,000 yuan in people's currency. Other accomplices were referred by the Municipal Court to the Baotou People's Court for handling.
