    Central Conservatory of Music
    Recruits New Students for the Regular Course
    The Central Conservatory of Music has been established in Tianjin for almost a year. To improve the theoretical and technical level of in-service music cadres, the institute has decided to recruit fifty students for the regular course this summer. Those in-service music cadres from the North China and Northwest China administrative regions with more than five years of music work experience may apply for the examination with a letter of introduction from their current work unit, certified by the political department of the military region or the cultural department of the greater administrative region, or the cultural and educational organs of the provincial or municipal governments. The institute has scheduled registration from August 14th to 17th, preliminary examination on the 19th, and re-examination on the 21st. Registration and examination locations: For the North China region, at the institute in Dawangzhuang, Hedong, Tianjin, 11 Jing Road; for the Northwest China region, at the Provincial Normal School in Shuyuanmen, Xi'an.
    Furthermore, due to the shortage of school buildings and the limitations of personnel establishment, the institute will not recruit new students, transfer students, elective students, or auditors for the undergraduate program or the juvenile class this summer. Students from afar should not make futile trips.

    中央音乐学院在天津成立以来将近一载。该院为提高在职音乐干部的理论和技术水平，决定今年夏季招收普通科学生五十名。凡具有五年以上音乐工作经验之华北、西北两行政区的在职音乐干部由现职机关备函介绍，经该地区军区政治部或大行政区文化部，或各省市政府文教机关之证明，均可报名，参加考试。该院已定于八月十四日到十七日报名、十九日初试、二十一日覆试。报名和考试地点：华北区在天津河东大王庄十一经路该院；西北区在西安市书院门省立师范学校内。
    又该院因校舍不敷应用及受人员编制的限制，今夏本科、少年班均不招收新生插班生、选科生及旁听生，远道学生，万勿徒劳往返。
