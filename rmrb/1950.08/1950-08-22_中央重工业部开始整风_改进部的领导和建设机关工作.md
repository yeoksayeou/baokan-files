　　Central Ministry of Heavy Industry Begins Rectification
    Improving Leadership and Work of Construction Agencies
    [Report from this newspaper] The Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry began rectification on the 14th of this month. The rectification mainly aims to solve two problems: first, to examine and summarize the ministry's leadership over its affiliated factories and mines; second, to build and improve the work of the ministry's agencies. From the examination and summary work, connect with the examination of individual party members' thoughts. The rectification focuses on party member cadres above the section level, especially leading cadres such as ministers, bureau directors, department heads, and division chiefs. The method and steps of rectification are: in the examination and summary work, leading cadres first summarize their own leadership work, conduct profound self-examination and self-criticism; then, highly promote democracy, widely absorb the opinions of cadres and the masses, and make bottom-up criticisms.
    Since its establishment last November, the ministry has conducted several reviews and education sessions on the ideology and work style of party members and cadres. For example, the general appraisal of cadres at the end of last year, the review of the issue of unity between party members and non-party members this year, discipline inspection, and the inspection and education of party-mass relations conducted before the public party, as well as the ongoing inspection of streamlining and savings, have all played a considerable role in improving the ideological level of the ministry's cadres.
    However, the previous ideological inspections were mostly limited to individual parts and focused more on general cadres, without linking to overall work, nor emphasizing the review of leading cadres at all levels. From the reflections of responsible cadres of affiliated factories and mines, it can be seen that there are still many problems that need to be solved in the ministry's leadership over factories and mines and in the construction of agency work: for example, the leadership of the ministry and bureaus make many demands on the lower levels, give many instructions, but provide little concrete help and are slow to solve problems; agency cadres reflect that there are many meetings, many official documents, many trivial affairs, unclear work plans and policies, and insufficient mutual connection between the work of various divisions. These facts show that leading cadres lack a comprehensive and systematic consideration of their work, there is some degree of inconsistency in their guiding ideology, there is more or less a sense of complacency, and they are not good at cooperating with non-party cadres. In response to the above situation, the Chinese Communist Party Group of the Ministry decided to systematically check the work and carry out the rectification movement in accordance with Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session and the Common Program, combined with the current work, in order to improve the ministry's leadership and the status quo of agency work, and strengthen the construction of the national heavy industry.

　　中央重工业部开始整风
    改进部的领导和建设机关工作
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部于本月十四日开始整风。整风中拟主要解决两个问题：一是检查与总结该部对所属厂、矿的领导；一是机关工作的建设和改进。从检查与总结工作中，联系检查党员个人思想。整风重点放在科级以上的党员干部，尤其是部、局、厅、司长等领导干部。整风的方法与步骤是：在检查与总结工作中，首先由领导干部总结自己的领导工作，进行深刻的检讨与自我批评；进而高度发扬民主，广泛吸收干部群众的意见，作自下而上的批评。
    该部自去年十一月成立以来，对于党员、干部的思想、作风曾进行过多次的检讨和教育。如去年年终的干部普遍鉴定，今年党内外团结问题的检讨、纪律检查、公开党以前又曾进行党群关系的检查教育，目前正在进行的精简节约检查等，都对提高机关干部的思想水平起了相当作用。
    但以往数次的思想检查，大部限于个人部分，且多着重于一般干部，没有联系全面工作，也未强调各级领导干部的检讨。从所属各厂矿负责干部的反映中，可以看出该部对厂矿的领导及机关工作建设中，还存在着不少问题亟需解决：如部、局的领导对下面要求多，指示多，具体的帮助少，解决问题慢；机关干部则反映会议多，公文多，琐碎事务多，工作计划方针不明确，各司工作互相联系不够。这些事实表明，领导干部对工作缺乏全盘的系统的考虑，在指导思想上存在着某种程度的不一致，存在着或多或少的居功自满情绪，不善于同非党干部合作。该部中共党组针对以上情况，决定根据毛主席在三中全会上的报告和共同纲领，结合当前工作，系统的检查工作，开展整风运动，以改善部的领导与机关工作现状，加强国家重工业的建设。    （重工业部报道组）
