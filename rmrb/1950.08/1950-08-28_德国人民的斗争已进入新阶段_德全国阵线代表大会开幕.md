　　The German People's Struggle Enters a New Stage
    National Front Congress Opens in Germany
    U.S. and British Occupiers' War Preparations in West Germany Pose Direct Threat to World Peace
    The German Nation Must Take Serious Steps to Defend National Survival
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 27th] According to TASS, the first National Congress of the National Front of Democratic Germany opened in Berlin on the 25th. The main task of the congress is to mobilize people from all walks of life in Germany to engage in national resistance, and to fight for the unification, peace, and national independence of Germany. Three thousand delegates attended the congress, almost half of whom were openly and secretly elected by the people of West Germany.
    Before the opening of the congress, hundreds of thousands of working people in Berlin and all the delegates attending the congress held celebrations and demonstrations. Dr. Correns, Chairman of the Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front, pointed out the great significance of this congress at the celebration. He said: The political situation in West Germany has reached a state where it poses a direct threat to world peace; the sinful measures of the U.S. and British occupying authorities have forced the German nation to take serious steps to defend national survival. The task of the National Congress is to point out the path to save the nation, maintain peace, and establish an independent Germany, and thereby live up to the trust of all peace-loving and democratic forces in the world, especially the Soviet Union and Marshal Stalin, in the German people.
    The congress opened after the parade. First, the presidium of the congress was elected, including President Pieck, Prime Minister Grotewohl, members of the National Committee, representatives from West Germany, and advanced workers of the republic. Then, Chairman Correns delivered the opening speech. He pointed out that the German people's struggle has entered a new stage. The U.S. and British imperialists, using the division of Germany as a means, are trying to rearm West Germany and make it a bridgehead for aggressive wars, and make the people of West Germany cannon fodder. However, the German people are not alone in their struggle, and they enjoy the full support of the peace camp under the leadership of the Soviet Union and Marshal Stalin.

　　德国人民的斗争已进入新阶段
    德全国阵线代表大会开幕
    美英占领者在西德备战对世界和平造成直接威胁
    德意志民族不得不采取严重步骤保卫民族的生存
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：民主德国全国阵线首届全国代表大会已于二十五日在柏林开幕。大会的主要工作是动员德国各界人民从事民族抵抗，为争取德国的统一、和平及民族独立而斗争。出席大会的代表三千人，其中差不多半数是西德人民公开地和秘密地选举出来的。
    在大会开幕前，柏林数十万劳动人民和出席大会的全体代表举行了庆祝会和示威游行。全国阵线全国委员会主席团主席科伦斯博士在庆祝会上指出了此次代表大会的重大意义。他说：西德的政治形势已经达到了这样一种状态，即已对世界和平造成了直接的威胁；美英占领当局的罪恶措施，已迫使德意志民族不得不采取严重步骤来保卫民族的生存。全国代表大会的任务，就是指出挽救民族、保持和平与建立独立的德国的道路，并从而不负全世界爱好和平和民主的力量首先是苏联和斯大林大元帅对德国人民的信赖。
    代表大会在游行后开幕，首先举出大会主席团，其中包括皮克总统、格罗提渥总理、全国委员会委员及西德代表们和共和国的先进工人们，然后由主席科伦斯致开幕词。他指出：德国人民的斗争，已进入新阶段。美英帝国主义者以分裂德国为手段，力图使西德重新武装起来，使之成为进行侵略战争的桥头堡垒，使西德人民充当炮灰。然而德国人民在斗争中并不是孤独的，他们享有在苏联和斯大林大元帅领导下的和平阵营的一切支援。
