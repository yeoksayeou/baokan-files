　　Bloody Swindlers
    Soviet Union Simonov
    On June 27, 1950, at 10:00 PM New York time, at Lake Success near New York, at a meeting of the Security Council, six less-than-respectable gentlemen passed a resolution for armed aggression against the Korean people; this resolution was less historical and more hysterical and bloody. After this resolution, according to their thinking, their great names were bound to be recorded in history.
    Once upon a time, in ancient times, a born arsonist, a swindler by nature greedy and cruel, Herostratus, burned down the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, thereby getting his name recorded—or rather, squeezed—into history, at any rate achieving his goal, because we do indeed still remember his great name today.
    Since then, greedy and cruel swindlers of all ages have longed for Herostratus's "reputation," from time to time engaging in all kinds of direct and symbolic arson.
    They could never understand that the Herostratus incident was a unique event in which stupidity and greed had their historical repercussions. So, they went to their graves unknown, resentfully, leaving not the slightest trace on the pages of history, not even the kind of trace left by an insect occasionally crushed in a thick book.
    But new swindlers gleefully come to take their place, not at all mindful of the tragic experiences of their predecessors. If we don't want to get sidetracked, let's leave aside the past few generations and just talk about the six gentlemen just mentioned—they should be given due credit—they are greedy enough, cruel enough, and crazy enough, so there is ample reason to classify them into this category.
    The greedy wishes of these so-called new swindlers of the New York era are something I am aware of, and I want to mention their names today, while it's not too late, because the day after tomorrow, hardly anyone will remember anyone of their kind.
    These are their great names: Blanco (Cuba), Correa (Ecuador), Sunde (Norway), Chauvel (France), Shaun (Britain), Austin (United States).
    Having said these names and these countries, obviously, I still need to say what tools they used to commit arson, tools they hope will make their names immortal.
    If Herostratus, who burned down the temple in the past, was in a rather difficult situation and didn't even have the concept of kerosene, if the "Gestapo" who burned the German Reichstag used British or American-made oil, then the tool chosen by the six gentlemen mentioned above to burn down the Palace of Peace is even more advanced. This tool was originally designed to prevent the Palace of Peace from being burned down; they used the United Nations Security Council as a tool to burn down the Palace of Peace.
    These six gentlemen were not only born in the six countries just mentioned, but they also represent their respective countries in the UN Security Council, which pleases the governments of these countries and angers the people of these countries.
    Therefore, the resolution passed by these six gentlemen in the Security Council at 10:00 PM New York time on June 27 of this year is not only a crazy and bloody plan. This resolution passed by representatives of six countries can also be said to be a crazy and bloody resolution of six countries.
    There are also more benign swindlers, and these are the swindlers who don't pretend. Swindlers who pretend are vicious swindlers. Swindlers who not only pretend but also hold political power are not only vicious but also dangerous swindlers.
    Obviously, the current leaders of the United States are the most complete typical of this last type of group of fools. It is truly the misfortune of the American people that in this group, which is now mistakenly valued by the American national powers, the doubly elected fool—Mr. Austin (one of the six gentlemen I want to introduce to the reader)—naturally does not occupy the first place, but it is not the last either.
    We are not prepared to talk about his biography in detail. The biographies of most current American government officials are doubtful. Indeed, even the American president himself felt it necessary to dispel rumors about his relationship with the thugs from his home state who were recently killed, so what can be said about small figures like Austin? At most, it can only be said that perhaps he really was not a thug in the past, just like the president, and only learned the tricks of thugs after coming to power.
    In fact, if it were only said that Mr. Austin, the U.S. representative to the Security Council, and his assistant, Mr. Gross, are merely dangerous swindlers of the national thug type that are now all over the United States, that would seem insufficient. Of course, that is the case, but if limited to explaining this generality, it would be unfair to Mr. Austin.
    Swindlers each have their own personality, and sometimes that personality is even unique. Mr. Austin's personality is that he is an exaggerated and garrulous swindler. He would not say directly: "Your money or your life!" but would definitely give a long speech while holding a pistol barrel at someone, talking about "true progress and democracy,"—which leads perfectly logically to the conclusion: he has a gun in his hand, and the other party is surrendering with their hands up. After taking the purse, he would give another speech about "progress and democracy." If anyone resisted, he would kill him and then deliver a speech—a funeral oration, again about "progress and democracy."
    Of course, Americans can also use Mr. Austin in their Congress, especially when there is a need to open up a debate, but they considered it for a while and didn't dare take the risk, so they sent him to the "United Nations" to let him make a fuss there! It just so happened that the United Nations recently has forces controlled by the United States itself, and they can say as much as they want.
    So Mr. Austin started rambling. Morning and evening, at banquets and at meetings, at the opening and closing of meetings, at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end, about topics listed and not listed on the agenda, on the podium and in his seat, after each speaker's speech, and in the middle of other people's speeches, as long as he felt that he had been silent for too long, he would speak. Talking about progress, talking about democracy, talking about "historical, international, collective efforts conducive to peace." Talking about morality, talking about freedom, talking about humanity, talking about the need to strangle the free Korean people (for this country, it is possible to bomb cities, burn villages, and slaughter children and women!), in short, enslave this free people! But Mr. Austin cannot speak briefly. Each time, after cursing the freedom-loving people in the usual way, he would pretend to pout, and then start speaking again, speaking, speaking, speaking endlessly. Perhaps now, as I write this, he is speaking at a regular meeting, constantly raising his voice, extorting from his timid partners in the Security Council—extorting warships from some, squadrons of planes from others, and even just two merchant ships from some, to participate in the military "sanctions" against the Korean people, attempting to more or less cover up America's blatant, rogue-like bloody aggression in Korea with the trademark of "collective" action.
    While Mr. Austin continues to speak, his partners remain silent, waiting for him to finish and express their agreement, and whenever Mr. Austin's words begin again, they fall silent again. I now want to briefly talk about these guys.
    Mr. Shaun, the adopted son of Oxford University and an old swindler of the old British diplomatic school, has shown considerable smoothness (it's not easy to learn this!): if in the past—when he was still in the lower ranks of diplomacy—Britain played a first-class role internationally, then now, when he himself has climbed to the upper ranks of this level, Britain has been reduced to an unenviable second-class role.
    Rating Mr. Shaun as smooth is based less on his personal statements and more on the fact that he is paired with Mr. Austin in the Security Council. This position is reserved only for someone who can demonstrate smoothness, reserved for someone who understands in his heart that whenever Americans speak, the British must learn the art of silence.
    In contrast to Mr. Austin, Mr. Shaun is taciturn. Precisely because of this, I think he is qualified to enjoy the renowned name of one of the finest speakers of modern Britain. In any case, his statement at the Security Council meeting: "I have nothing to add to the statement of the U.S. representative" can very well be engraved in gold on the wall of the British meeting hall as the most accurate and concise formula for modern British policy.
    However, sometimes, Mr. Shaun even has to make up for his unavoidable reticence in the Security Council. That is when he and his slightly different British companion, Mr. Jebb, incessantly attack the stubborn Egyptian representative. Because Egypt is unwilling to send its troops to invade Korea; in general, it is certainly unwilling to do so before British troops withdraw from Egypt in any case.
    In this situation, Mr. Shaun will recall with heavy heart the good old days when he worked in Cairo, when he did not need to hide his frank colonialist opinions: the Egyptian people are neither unified nor divided, and not even a nation at all.
    In the diplomatic envoy group, Mr. Chauvel, this swindler, is famous for one thing: as early as 1949, he proposed abandoning the "outdated" concept of national sovereignty and claimed that not only he, Chauvel, but all of France was making this preparation, but, speaking of France, or rather, the French people, they would absolutely not support Mr. Chauvel's proposal. As for Mr. Chauvel himself, we must admit that there is no inconsistency between words and deeds, and undoubtedly, he has long ceased to be a sovereign figure in the Security Council. If the British Mr. Shaun still has the sentence "I have nothing to add to the statement of the U.S. representative," then the French Mr. Chauvel would not even have the slightest intention of making even the smallest addition. He "unconditionally supports the American proposal on the Korean issue." And he not only "unconditionally supports it," but also hurriedly runs ahead to curry favor (he is a flattering swindler, that is precisely his nature), eager to convince people that "the role France has played in Asia (that is, in Vietnam—author's note) over the past three years is similar to the role the Security Council is currently playing in Korea."
    Norwegian representative Mr. Sunde is also an indispensable swindler. As a representative and banker of the Norwegian shipbuilding and commercial groups, he is indeed skilled in business, but has nothing to do with the Korean issue. However, since Americans are indifferent to anything other than their own affairs, and countries that worship the Marshall Plan as a god should only care about American affairs, Mr. Sunde must, of course, agree to "unconditionally support the American resolution."
    Now, as I write this article, Mr. Sunde has routinely become the Executive Chairman of the Security Council. From his embarrassed statements to reporters, it seems that what he is currently considering is how to appear more comfortable in this position; unconditionally raising both hands in support of all American proposals, while secretly trying to avoid sending the Norwegian ships that the Americans are demanding to Korea.
    It is not easy to be such an ad-hoc swindler, and Mr. Sunde is comforted by the fact that he is not alone among his colleagues. As recently disclosed in the newspapers, his colleague, Foreign Minister Lange, once pleaded with the American ambassador to reduce the planned American military aid to Norway. In our view, this is already enough! However, the American ambassador was heartless and said that Mr. Lange's opinion had no effect on this issue; what had an effect was the opinion of the American military circles, who believed that regardless of whether the Norwegians wanted it or not, the "aid" would definitely arrive.
    Mr. Sunde's future is not so good, because in Mr. Austin's view, the attitude towards Mr. Sunde in New York does not need to be any more amiable than the American ambassador's attitude towards Mr. Lange in Oslo.
    Mr. Blanco is the Cuban representative. What can be said about this puppet swindler? I can't think of a better word, because as long as people habitually pull a string casually, this puppet will raise its hand to approve the massacre of women and children, and approve the transformation of peaceful cities into ruins. A puppet is still a puppet, but the blood is real blood. After the blood has flowed, those who voted in favor of such a proposal, including the puppet, will have to be held responsible.
    Ecuadorian representative Mr. Correa is a philosophical and ambitious swindler. While discussing the Korean issue, he declared: "Respect for the territorial integrity of small countries is the basis of international peace," therefore "as a representative of a small country, he is very happy to support the American proposal" and believes that the methods suggested in Truman's statement are "completely correct."
    This is a typical swindler who likes to use flowery words and is good at flattery: when Shaun has nothing to add and Chauvel unconditionally agrees, Correa either shouts: "Very happy!" or says tearfully: "Completely correct!" or shouts excitedly with a stutter: "Me too! Me! Me!" In short, he is so anxious that he is afraid that his faithfully raised hand will be missed during the vote count.
    And Mr. Austin is still talking about morality, justice, and democracy at this time. In turn, he sternly examines the submissive, frightened, dog-like faithful eyes of his little partners, and after seeing in their eyes agreement with everything suitable for the United States in the bloody aggression against the Korean people, Austin sweetly narrows his eyes, enjoying the sound of his own voice, and says nonchalantly: "Without any bold illusions, it can be pointed out that when such a large group of countries with such noble responses shines brightly, it is the dawn of a new day in international cooperation."
    American bombs are falling over Korean cities.
    Korean mothers are picking up the shattered bodies of their children.
    The bloody swindler Austin continues to speak...

　　血腥的骗子们
    苏联  西蒙诺夫
    一九五○年六月二十七日，纽约时间晚上十点钟，在纽约附近的成功湖，在安全理事会的会议上，六个不大受人尊敬的绅士通过了一项武装进攻朝鲜人民的决议；与其说这项决议是历史性的，不如说它是歇斯底里的而且血腥的。在这项决议之后，按照他们的想法，他们的大名是势必应该载入史册的了。
    从前，在古代时候，天生的玩火者、本性贪狠残酷的骗子，赫洛斯塔德，焚毁了阿几米德·埃非斯基的庙宇，从而使自己的名字载入了——无宁说是挤入了——历史中去，不管怎么样总算达到了自己的目的，因为我们确实直到如今还记得他的大名。
    从此以后，各个时代的贪狠残酷的骗子们渴望得到赫洛斯塔德的“声誉”，不时地干着各种各样、直接的和象征的纵火事件。
    他们无论如何也不能了解赫洛斯塔德事件是愚蠢和贪狠有其历史的反响的独一无二的事件，于是他们没没无闻，愤愤不平地走向坟墓去，在史页上没有留下丝毫的痕迹，甚而至于连在厚厚的书本里偶尔被压死的昆虫所留下那样的痕迹都没有。
    但是，新的骗子们却兴高采烈地来接替他们，一点也不顾及先辈们的悲惨经验。如果我们不想牵扯开去，那就把过去的几个世代撇来不提，单来谈谈刚才说到的六个绅士——对于他们是应该给予应有的评价的——他们都够贪狠，够残酷还够疯狂，因此有充分理由把他们归到这一类。
    这些所谓纽约时代的新骗子们的贪狠的愿望是我所认识的，我想就在今天，趁还未过晚的时候，提一提他们的名字，因为一到后天，他们这一类人就未必有谁再记起了。
    这就是他们的大名：布朗可（古巴）、柯里阿（厄瓜多尔），森德（挪威）、乔维尔（法国）、萧恩（英国）、奥斯汀（美国）。
    在说出这些名字，和这些国家之后，显然，我还需要说出他们用以纵火的工具，他们是希望靠这个工具使自己的名字永垂不朽的。
    如果从前焚毁庙宇的赫洛斯塔德在相当困难的情况中，甚至连对于火油的概念也没有，如果火烧德国国会的“盖世太保”使用过英国或美国出品的石油；那么刚才提到的六位先生所选定的要来焚毁和平大厦的工具，却更进了一步，这工具正是当初为了要防止这一和平大厦被焚烧而设计的工具；他们把联合国安全理事会，用作焚毁和平大厦的工具了。
    这六位先生不仅出生于刚才提到的六个国家，而且，他们还在联合国安理会中代表着各自的国家，这是使这些国家的政府满意，这些国家的人民愤怒的。
    因此，本年六月二十七日，纽约时间下午十时这六位先生在安理会中所通过的决议，不仅是疯狂血腥的计划。这一项由六个国家的代表所通过的决议还可以说是六个国家的疯狂血腥的决议。
    骗子也有比较善良的，这就是并不装模作样的骗子。装模作样的骗子就是凶恶的骗子。不仅装模作样，而且掌握着政权的骗子，那就是不仅凶恶，而且危险的骗子了。
    显然，现今美国的领导人物，就是这最后一种型式的愚人集团中最完全的典型了。真是美国人民的不幸，在现在为美国国家权贵错误地所重视的这个集团中，带有双重意味的被选举出来的愚人——奥斯汀先生（我想介绍给读者的六位绅士中的一个）所占的地位自然决不是第一位，但也不是末一位。
    我们并不预备详谈他的传记。当今美国政府官员的传记有绝大部分是令人怀疑的。的确，甚至美国总统自己，对于他本人跟不久前被打死的他本州的流氓的关系，也认为有辟谣的必要，那么，对于小人物如奥斯汀之流，该说些什么呢？至多只好说，也许他真的和总统一样，过去并不是流氓，在当权之后，才学会了流氓本领的。
    事实上，如果光说安理会中，美国代表奥斯汀先生及其助手格鲁斯只不过是现在遍布于美国的全国性流氓型的危险骗子，那似乎是不够的。当然，事实如此，但如果仅限于说明这一般性，那就对于奥斯汀先生是不公正的。
    骗子们各有各的个性，有时那个性甚至于举世无双。奥斯汀先生的个性就在他是夸张而且饶舌的骗子。他不会直截了当这样说：“要命还是要钱！”而是一面用手枪筒拦住一个人，一面一定发一大篇议论，谈到“真正的进步和民主”，——这完全合理地归宿于这样的结论：他手中是枪，而他的对方是高举双手投降。拿去了钱袋之后，他再来一篇关于“进步和民主”的演说。碰到谁来抵抗，他就杀死他，然后再发表演说——安葬演说，又是关于“进步和民主”。
    当然，美国人也可以在他们的国会里利用奥斯汀先生，特别是当那里需要展开辩论的时候，但是他们考虑了一番，总没敢冒这个险，于是把他派到“联合国”，让他到那里去瞎缠吧！恰好最近联合国那边有美国自己所控制的势力，要想说多少，就可以说多少。
    于是奥斯汀先生扯起淡来了。早上和晚上，宴会上和会场上，在会议开幕和闭幕的时候，在开头，在中间以及在临末，关于议事日程上所列入的和没有列入的议题，在讲台上和在自己席位上，在每个演说者的演讲之后，以及在别人演讲的中间，只要他觉得自己沉默得太长久些他就说。谈到进步，谈到民主、谈到“有利于和平的历史的、国际的、集体的努力”。谈到道德，谈到自由，谈到人道，谈到需要绞杀自由的朝鲜人民，（对于这国家，是可以轰炸城市，焚烧乡村，屠杀儿童和妇女的！）简单一句话，奴役这个自由的人民！但是奥斯汀先生可不能讲得简短。每次照例的对爱好自由的人民咒骂一阵之后，他假心假意努一努嘴，于是重新说、说、说、说个不休。也许现在，当我写这篇东西的时候，他正在例会上说着，不断提高着嗓音，向安理会中胆怯的伙伴们勒索着——向有些人勒索战舰，向有些人勒索飞机队，向有些人就是勒索两只商船也好，要大家参加对朝鲜人民的军事“制裁”，企图多多少少以“集体”行动的商标来掩盖一下美国在朝鲜的公然的、流氓式的血腥进攻。
    在奥斯汀先生继续说下去的时候，他的伙伴们沉默着，要等他结束，来表示同意，每当奥斯汀先生的话重新开始，他们就又沉默了。我现在要就这些家伙简单地谈一谈。
    牛津大学的养子，旧英国外交学派的老骗子萧恩先生所表现的是相当的圆滑（学会这一点好不容易！）：要是在以前——他还在外交等级下层的时候——英国在国际上扮演了第一等角色，那么，现在，当他自己已经爬到这个等级上层的时候，英国可就降到不足羡慕的二等角色了。
    把萧恩先生评定为圆滑，与其说根据于他个人的声明，不如说由于他在安理会中和奥斯汀先生搭挡这一个事实。这位置是单只预备给那个能够表现圆滑的人，预备给那种心里明白，每逢美国人讲话，英国人就须学会沉默本领的人的。
    与奥斯汀先生相反，萧恩先生是沉默寡言的。正因为如此，所以我看他有资格享受现代英国最优秀的一个演说家的令名。无论如何，他在安理会会议上的声明：“对美国代表的声明，我再没有什么可以补充”，这一句很可以用金字刻在英国会会议厅的墙上，作为现代英国政策最准确最简明的公式。
    然而，有的时候，萧恩先生甚至就在安理会中也要把自己迫不得已的寡言补足一下。那就是当他和那位跟他稍有区别的英国同伴吉浦先生，喋喋不休地攻击执拗的埃及代表的时候。因为埃及不愿意派遣自己的部队去侵略朝鲜；就一般来说，无论如何在英国部队自埃及撤退之前是确实不愿意的。
    在这种情形之下，萧恩先生会带着沉重的心情回想起从前的好日子，那时候他在开罗工作，那时候他不需要掩盖自己坦白的殖民者的意见：埃及人民既不是统一的；也不是分割的，根本不是什么民族。
    外交使节群中，乔维尔先生这一个骗子是以这么一件事情出名的：还在一九四九年，他就提议摒弃关于民族主权的“陈旧”观念，并且声称：作此准备的不仅是他乔维尔，而是整个法兰西，但是，说到法兰西，更确切些，法兰西人民呢，那是绝对不会支持乔维尔先生这个提议的。至于乔维尔先生本人，我们应当承认，言行没有什么不符，毫无疑问，他在安理会早就不是什么有主权的角色了。如果说英国的萧恩先生还有“对美国代表的声明我再没有什么可以补充”这一句话，那么法国的乔维尔先生就连要作那怕是最小的任何补充的念头也不会有的。他是“无条件地支持着关于朝鲜问题的美国提案”。并且他不仅是“无条件地支持着”，还急急忙忙跑到前面去献殷勤（他是殷勤的骗子，这正是他的本性），急于使人确信：“最近三年来法国在亚洲（也就是在越南——作者注）所起的作用正和目前安理会在朝鲜所起的作用相似”。
    挪威代表森德先生也是一个省不掉的骗子。作为挪威造船业与商业集团的代表兼银行家的他，确实长于商务，然而跟朝鲜问题却丝毫无关。但是由于美国人除了自己的事情之外，对任何别人的事情都漠不关心，而遵奉马歇尔计划如神的国家又应当单只关心美国的事情，于是森德先生当然要赞成，要“无条件支持美国的决议”了。
    现在，当我写这篇文章的时候，森德先生已经循例当了安理会的执行主席。从他对新闻记者的狼狈声明看来，他现在所考虑的是如何在这位置上显得更自在些；无条件地举起双手赞成美国人的一切提议，而暗中要避免派遣美国人所要求的挪威舰船到朝鲜去。
    作这样一个应景的骗子可并不容易，森德先生聊以自慰的就是在自己的同僚中间他并不是孤独的。如同不久前报纸上所披露的，他的同僚，外交部长兰赫曾经向美国大使恳请缩减预定的美国对挪威的军事援助。在我们看来，这是已经够了！然而那美国大使却是铁石心肠，他说兰赫先生的意见对这问题不起什么作用，起作用的乃是美国军事界的意见，他们认为不管挪威人要不要，“援助”一定会到来。
    森德先生的前途并不怎么好，因为在奥斯汀先生看来，在纽约对森德先生的态度，是不必比美国大使在奥斯陆对兰赫先生更和气些的。
    布朗可先生是古巴代表。关于这个傀儡骗子，有什么可说的呢？我想不出更好的话来，因为只要人们习惯地随便地牵一牵线，这个傀儡便会举起手来赞成屠杀妇女儿童，赞成和平城市变为废墟。傀儡依然是傀儡，鲜血倒是真正的鲜血。等到鲜血流了以后，那些投票赞成这种提议的，包括傀儡在内，可就不得不负责任了。
    厄瓜多尔代表柯里阿先生是会玩弄哲学的有野心的骗子。就在讨论朝鲜问题的时候，他声明道：“尊重小国的领土完整，这一点是国际和平的基础”，因此“作为小国代表的他就非常高兴地支持美国的提案”，并认为杜鲁门声明中所提示的办法是“完全正确”的。
    这就是在我们面前的一个喜欢使用华美词藻、善于阿谀奉迎的骗子典型：当萧恩没有什么补充、乔维尔无条件同意的时候，柯里阿或是喊一句：“非常高兴！”或是感激涕零地说：“完全正确！”或是激动着口吃地喊道：“还有我！我！我！”总之是着急得唯恐在查票时候把他那忠实举起的手给漏掉了。
    而奥斯汀先生此时还正在讲着道德、正义、民主。顺次严厉地察看一下自己小伙伴们的驯服的、受惊的、狗一样忠实的眼睛，在对朝鲜人民的血腥进攻上，从他们的眼睛里看到了对适合于美国的一切的同意之后，奥斯汀甜蜜地眯细了眼睛，欣赏着自己讲话的声音，满不在意地说道：“不带任何大胆的幻想就可以指出，有着如此高尚的响应的大群国家闪耀着光辉的时候，正是国际合作上新日子的黎明。”
    朝鲜城市的上空正在落着美国炸弹。
    朝鲜的母亲正要把自己孩子的炸碎了的躯体抱起来。
    血腥的骗子奥斯汀还是继续说下去……
