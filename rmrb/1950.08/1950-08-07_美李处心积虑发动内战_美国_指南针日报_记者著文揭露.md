Xinhua News Agency, August 6th: According to a TASS dispatch from New York on August 5th: The Compass newspaper published a dispatch from its Lake Success reporter, Steele, revealing that the US imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique had decided to launch an aggressive offensive as early as July of last year, but it was later postponed due to an unexpected event. The dispatch stated:

　　Among the documents left behind by the members of the United Nations Commission on Korea when they fled Seoul were the minutes of a joint meeting held by the Syngman Rhee cabinet and the South Korean military leaders on February 14, 1949. The meeting passed a resolution to launch a war against North Korea no later than July 1949. These documents from the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs fell into the hands of the North Koreans when Seoul was captured.

　　The head of the US Military Advisory Group, Roberts, attended the meeting as an "observer." At the meeting, Syngman Rhee requested Roberts to forward to Washington the request for an immediate increase in the supply of American weapons.

　　Following this meeting, intense war preparations began. According to these documents, as a first step, the South Korean Army Headquarters began conscripting all men between the ages of eighteen and forty-five.

　　American military instructors rapidly trained six regular divisions equipped with American weapons. This training took place in Noshan (transliteration) near Seoul, with approximately 10,000 former senior and junior Japanese officers participating.

　　In July 1949, five South Korean divisions were massed along the 38th parallel, with the vanguard, composed of the elite troops of the South Korean army, deployed in Baichuan (transliteration). The task at that time was to occupy Haeju, not far north of the 38th parallel. These troops had participated in the bloody suppression of the Incheon and Jeju Island "rebellions" in 1946.

　　Defense Minister Shin Sung-mo delivered a speech at the South Korean Youth Congress held in Incheon on July 17, 1949, saying: "Our army is waiting for the orders of our President. As soon as his orders are issued, we will occupy Pyongyang and Wonsan within a day."

　　The stage was thus set for an invasion of North Korea. But later, an unexpected event occurred, making the US military advisory group feel that the South Korean army was not yet reliable. This unexpected event was: within two weeks, two battalions of South Korean troops mutinied and fled to North Korea.

　　Documents found in Seoul showed that the US military advisors had told Syngman Rhee that the planned invasion in July 1949 was premature and that a large-scale purge should be carried out within the South Korean army and administrative institutions before an offensive could be launched.

　　Thus, the invasion was delayed. And following this advice, the Syngman Rhee government carried out a purge within the South Korean army; during the purge, fifty-five officers and soldiers were shot, and fifteen thousand people were removed from the army.

　　Ultra-rightists such as Cai Bingde, Jin Xiyuan, Li Yingjun, and Li Henggen completely controlled the South Korean Supreme Command. Then an unprecedented catastrophe occurred; in the midst of this, about 50,000 South Koreans were imprisoned, and about 100 villages were burned down, and the residents of these villages were either shot or sent to concentration camps.

　　After the failure of the July 1949 offensive plan, all further preparations were carried out in secret. On August 15, 1949, Syngman Rhee established a 20-kilometer-wide restricted zone along the 38th parallel.

　　It is said that these and other facts are all contained in the documents captured in Seoul.

### 美李处心积虑发动内战  美国“指南针日报”记者著文揭露

　　美李处心积虑发动内战
    美国“指南针日报”记者著文揭露
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社纽约五日讯：指南针日报发表该报驻成功湖记者斯蒂尔的电讯，揭露美帝国主义与李承晚集团早在去年七月，即曾决定发动侵略进攻，但后来因为意外的事件而延期。该电讯称：
    联合国朝鲜委员会委员们在逃出汉城时丢下的文件中，载有李承晚内阁与南朝鲜军首长在一九四九年二月十四日举行的联席会议的记录。那次会议通过了对北朝鲜发动战争不迟于一九四九年七月的决定。南朝鲜外交部的这些文件在汉城被攻占时落入北朝鲜人之手。
    美国军事顾问团团长罗伯兹以“观察员”身份出席会议。在会上，李承晚要求罗伯兹将立即增加美国武器供应的请求转达华盛顿。
    在这一会议之后，紧张的战争准备就开始了，据这些文件说，作为第一步，南朝鲜军参谋总部开始征召所有从十八岁到四十五岁的男子入伍。
    美国军事教官们迅速训练了六个美械装配的正规师。这种训练是在汉城附近卢山（译音）进行的，并有前日军高级和低级军官约一万名参加。
    一九四九年七月，南朝鲜五个师结集在三八线沿线，由南朝鲜精锐的部队所组成的前锋队在白川（译音）展开。当时进攻的任务，是要占领三八线以北不远的海州。这些部队曾在一九四六年参加过摧残仁川和济州岛“叛变”的血腥镇压。
    国防部长官申性模一九四九年七月十七日在仁川举行的南朝鲜青年大会上发表演说说：“我们的军队正在等待着我们总统的命令。只要他的命令一发出，我们就会在一天内占领平壤和元山”。
    侵略北朝鲜的局面，就这样布置好了。但是后来发生了意外事件，使美国军事顾问团感到南朝鲜军队还不足依恃。这件意外事件是：在两星期内，有两营南朝鲜军队叛变，逃到了北朝鲜。
    在汉城发现的文件表明：美国军事顾问曾告诉李承晚，原定一九四九年七月发动的侵略，为期过早，应先在南朝鲜军队和行政机构内进行大规模的清洗，然后方能发动进攻。
    这样，侵略便拖延了下来。并且遵奉这个劝告，李承晚政府在南朝鲜军队内进行清除；在清洗过程中，枪毙了五十五名军官和士兵，自部队中清除了一万五千人。
    极右分子如蔡秉德、金锡源、李应俊和李亨根就完全控制了南朝鲜的最高统帅部。于是空前的浩劫发生了；在这中间，约有五万个南朝鲜人被关进监狱，约有一百个村庄被烧毁，这些村庄的居民不是被枪毙就是被送进集中营。
    一九四九年七月进攻的计划失败后，一切进一步的准备都在秘密中进行。一九四九年八月十五日，李承晚就沿三八线建立了二十公里宽的禁区。
    据说这些以及其他事实，都载在汉城被卤获的文件中。
