　　Tong County Continuously Indulges in Illegal Tree Cutting
　　Leading to Mass Destruction of Forests
　　Illegal Cadres Have Been Removed and Punished

　　There are 2,100 mu of sandy wasteland northwest of Dacaozhuang in the Third District of Tong County, Hebei. Villagers planted more than 40,000 trees on this sandy wasteland. Last autumn, villager Chang Shaozong secretly went to cut down trees. He was discovered by village cadres, who sent him to the Third District government. The district government released him, telling him to return to the farmers' association to admit his mistake, without conducting ideological education or taking any action against him. Chang Shaozong stole trees a second time. Village cadres caught him and sent him to the district government again, but before the cadres and militiamen who delivered the tree thief could return to the village, Chang Shaozong had already been released. He even said, "This is nothing, I'm going to do it again!" Following this, Cao Zhi, Cao Qingyue, and others also stole trees. After being reported by the tree owners, village cadres sent them to the district government. The district cadres, considering their difficult living conditions, released them. After this, villagers saw that the tree thieves were not punished and began to steal trees one after another. Village cadres and militiamen also did not interfere. Even the militia joint defense company commander Wang Lianyou, instructor Cao Lufeng, production committee member Cao Xinzhi, militiamen Cao Xinhua, Cao Xibao, and others, a total of ten people, used guns and carts to cut down seven large elm trees belonging to others and sold them in Tong County, each receiving 8,500 yuan. Although the district committee had discovered this problem, it did not take action. Therefore, Cao Qingyue and Cao Xigui continued to steal trees. After being sent to the district, they were simply educated by the district government and allowed to return to the village to admit their mistakes to the masses. After returning to the village, they complained loudly, expressing "no repentance." The district committee reported this situation to the Tong County Committee, but the county committee was busy with the autumn grain requisition and land reform work and did not address it. On another occasion, Deputy Village Chief Wang Xikong led his entire family to steal trees in broad daylight. When the district chief found out, he called the Public Security Bureau for instructions. The reply was also to let him return to the village to admit his mistake. However, Wang's arrogance increased after returning to the village.

　　The masses, seeing this lawless phenomenon, felt that their property was not guaranteed, and that if they did not cut down the trees, others would cut them all down. So, they began to cut down trees indiscriminately. This continued until March of this year, resulting in the destruction of 10,800 trees.

　　Now, the county committee and county government have taken action: those who stole trees must pay compensation, and the illegal village cadres have been removed from their posts and sent to the county government for legal processing.

### 通县连续放纵偷砍树木  造成群众性破坏树林事件  违法干部已予撤职处分

　　通县连续放纵偷砍树木
    造成群众性破坏树林事件
    违法干部已予撤职处分
    河北通县三区大曹庄西北有二千一百亩沙荒。这片沙荒上由村民种了四万余株树。去年秋天，村民常少宗偷偷跑去伐树，被村干部发现，将他送到三区区政府，区政府把他放了，叫他回去向农会认错，没有从思想上对他进行教育，也没作处理。常少宗第二次偷树，村干部捉到他，又把他送到区政府，但送偷树的干部、民兵还没有走回村，偷树的常少宗却已经放回来了。并说：“这算不了什么，我还要干！”接着又有曹智、曹庆月等偷树，由树主告发，经村干部送区政府，区干部认为他们生活困难，把他们放了。此后，村民看见偷树的人没有受到惩办，也先后前去偷树；村干部与民兵也不去干涉。甚至一次有民兵联防中队长王连有、指导员曹路峰、生产委员曹新知、民兵曹新会、曹希宝等十人，持枪拉车伐走别人的榆树七大株，弄到通县卖去，每人分得八千五百元。虽然区委已发现这问题，但未加处理。所以接着又有曹庆月、曹希贵偷树。送区后，经区政府简单教育，即让其自行回村向群众认错。他们回村后，却大发牢骚，表示“不改”。区委将这情况报告通县县委，县委正忙于秋征和土地改革工作，亦未处理。又有一次是副村长王希孔率领全家白天偷树。区长知道了，打电话请示公安局，所得答复也是让其自己回村认错。但王回村后气焰更高。
    群众看到这种无法无天的现象，感到财产没有保障，自己不伐就要被别人伐光。于是也就不分彼此的乱伐起来。这样持续到今年三月，树木已被破坏一万零八百株。
    现在，县委会及县政府已经处理了：一般偷树的要赔偿，违法村干部已予以撤职处分，并送县政府依法处理。
