Introduction to the Vietnamese "August Revolution"
　　August 19th is the anniversary of Vietnam's famous August Revolution, and this year marks the fifth anniversary.

　　In August 1945, Japanese imperialism announced its unconditional surrender. At that time, under the leadership of the Vietnam Independence League (Viet Minh), the Vietnamese people, in their guerrilla warfare against the Japanese imperialist army and its French collaborators, had already liberated six provinces in northern Vietnam and established people's power in the liberated areas - the People's Liberation Committee. The Central Committee of the Viet Minh, anticipating the imminent collapse of Japanese imperialism, convened the All-Vietnam People's Representative Conference in North Vietnam on August 16th to discuss the establishment of the All-Vietnam People's Liberation Committee and other issues. On the first night of the conference, the Viet Minh leaders learned of Japan's unconditional surrender. Ho Chi Minh, the wise leader of the Viet Minh, in order to quickly disarm the Japanese army entrenched in Vietnam, immediately issued an order for a general uprising to the Vietnamese people and established a National General Uprising Committee to guide the actions of the national armed forces, attack the Japanese army that refused to disarm, and seize major cities. The entire Vietnamese people enthusiastically responded to this order. They organized themselves, attacked the Japanese army and its collaborators. On August 19th, the Vietnamese people's armed forces liberated Hanoi, the capital of North Vietnam, and the citizens of Hanoi held enthusiastic demonstrations to celebrate their liberation. Since then, August 19th has been regarded by the Vietnamese people as the anniversary of the August Revolution, becoming a glorious page in the history of the Vietnamese revolution.

　　Under the impact of the climax of the August Revolution, imperialists and their running dogs fled or surrendered. Bao Dai, the "Emperor of Annam" supported by the Japanese, was forced to abdicate on August 24th. On August 25th, Saigon and the provinces of South Vietnam were also liberated. On September 2nd of the same year, President Ho Chi Minh announced the establishment of the independent, democratic Republic of Vietnam and the establishment of the People's Government in Hanoi. However, the imperialists were unwilling to accept their defeat. Under MacArthur's orders, British troops occupied the southern half of Vietnam, and Kuomintang troops occupied the northern half, helping the French colonialists launch a war to reconquer the Vietnamese people, attempting to strangle the young Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In nearly four years of war, the French army suffered losses of 150,000 men and spent 115 billion francs annually, occupying only less than 10 percent of Vietnamese territory and only 2 million people, while the liberated areas of the Republic of Vietnam had more than 90 percent of the territory and 20 million people.

　　Currently, the Vietnamese people, nearing final victory, are inheriting the glorious tradition of the "August Revolution," uniting closely under the banner of the Republic, actively preparing for a general counter-offensive, and fighting to overthrow the American and French imperialists and their puppets, and to win the complete independence and freedom of the Vietnamese nation.

　　越南“八月革命”介绍
    八月十九日是越南有名的八月革命的纪念日，今年已是五周年。
    一九四五年八月，日本帝国主义宣布无条件投降。当时，越南人民在越南独立同盟的领导下，已在反对日本帝国主义的军队及其法国合作者的游击战争中，解放了越南北部的六个省分，并在解放地区建立了人民的政权——人民解放委员会。越盟中央委员会当时预见到日本帝国主义的即将崩溃，乃于八月十六日在北越召开全越人民代表大会，讨论成立全越人民解放委员会等问题。在会议的第一天晚上，越盟的领袖们获悉了日本无条件投降的消息。越盟英明的领导者胡志明主席，为了迅速解除盘据在越南的日军的武装，立即向越南人民颁发了总起义的命令，并成立全国总起义委员会，指导全国武装部队的行动，进攻拒绝解除武装的日军，夺取大城市。全越南人民热烈地响应了这一命令。他们纷纷组织起来，袭击日军及其合作者。八月十九日，越南人民武装解放了北越首府河内，河内市民举行狂热的示威游行，庆祝他们的解放。从此，八月十九日便被越南人民当作八月革命的纪念日，成为越南革命历史上光辉的一页。
    在八月革命高潮的冲击下，帝国主义及其走狗们纷纷逃跑或投降。日本扶植的“安南帝国皇帝”保大，于八月二十四日被迫宣告退位。八月二十五日，西贡及南越各省也完成解放。同年九月二日，胡志明主席在河内宣布了越南的独立、民主共和国的建立和人民政府的成立。但是，帝国主义者对于他们的失败是不甘心的。在麦克阿瑟的命令下，英国军队进占了越南南半部，国民党军队进占了北半部，帮助法国殖民者发动重新征服越南人民的战争，企图扼杀年青的越南民主共和国。在将近四年的战争中，法国军队损失达十五万人，每年耗费一千一百五十亿法郎，仅仅占领越南领土不及百分之十，人口仅有二百万人，而越南共和国解放区却拥有百分之九十以上的领土和二千万的人口。
    目前，接近最后胜利的越南人民，继承着“八月革命”的光荣传统，正紧密地团结在共和国的旗帜下，积极准备总反攻，为打倒美、法帝国主义者及其傀儡，争取越南民族完全独立、自由而斗争。
