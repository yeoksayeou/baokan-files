To the Editor:

　　My wife was admitted to the North China People's Hospital on July 14th for childbirth. After more than twenty days, there were still no signs of labor. On August 8th, the hospital decided to induce labor. The mention of "surgery" reminded me of the criticisms of the hospital that had appeared several times in the People's Forum, and I couldn't help but feel uneasy. When I went to the hospital at 7:00 AM on the 10th, I learned it was a difficult birth. The hospital invited Dr. Lin to help. The atmosphere in the delivery room was quite tense. Moreover, after two days, my wife was extremely exhausted. Seeing that the situation looked grim, my mind was in turmoil. Director Zhang said to me, "We will do our best to ensure the safety of both mother and child." But the screams of the mother made me lose confidence. I paced back and forth outside the window, my heart burning with anxiety. At 9:00 AM, the child was born, and I held my wife's hand, feeling infinitely relieved. Looking back at the child, she didn't cry or move, and I thought she was already gone. A few minutes later, she "wailed" and cried out. I saw Director Zhang and Dr. Lin with beads of sweat on their faces and couldn't help but express my deep gratitude and respect to them. After my wife returned to the ward, she told me very movedly: "All night yesterday, Director Zhang and several nursing comrades stayed in the delivery room. Director Zhang was so tired that he almost fell off his stool several times. He kept checking books, being very careful and conscientious. The nursing comrades were extremely enthusiastic, taking care of everything very thoughtfully. The medical director stayed in the delivery room from early morning until the child was born, only then did he leave."

　　The next day, I went to the hospital to visit and went to the restroom, which was very clean. Director Zhang also told me: "The child's head was slightly injured due to the forceps, and after being examined by Director Wang of the pediatrics department, we can rest assured if there is no danger after a week." I began to feel that this high level of service spirit and enthusiasm towards patients is the beginning of a new era for the hospital, an era that stems from the improvement of the political consciousness of the hospital's medical staff and their facing up to and improving past mistakes and shortcomings.

　　According to the feedback from some patients, the hospital has made great improvements in all aspects, and some patients, after being transferred to other sanatoriums, have requested to return.

　　I feel that although the overall improvement of the hospital is just beginning, these small achievements are worth cherishing. "It is simple to begin, but great to finish." I hope that all comrades of the North China People's Hospital can doubly cherish this newborn seedling and make it grow stronger day by day.

　　爱护这个新生的幼苗
    王聘余同志对华北人民医院的希望编辑同志：
    我的爱人因生产于七月十四日入华北人民医院，经过了二十多天仍无临产的迹象，直到八月八日院方决定给她引产。提起“动手术”，使我想起人民园地曾经好几次对该院的批评，不免捏一把汗。十日早晨七时，我去医院一看，知道是难产。院方请了林大夫来帮忙。产房的空气是相当紧张的。同时已经过两天，我的爱人疲劳已极。眼看凶多吉少，我的心绪十分紊乱。张主任向我说：“我们要尽力做到使母子都能获得安全。”可是产妇的惨叫声使我失去了信心。我在窗外踱来踱去，心中如焚。到了九时，孩子生下来了，我握着我爱人的手，感到无限的欣慰。回头看看孩子，她哭也不哭，动也不动，我以为她早就完了。几分钟之后，她却“哇”的哭出声来。我看到张主任和林大夫满脸的汗珠，不免对他们表示深切的感激与敬意。我的爱人回到病室后，她很感动地告诉我说：“昨天整夜，张主任和几位护理同志一直守在产房。张主任倦得几次要从凳子上倒下来。他不时地在查书、谨慎认真得很。护理同志们更是热情极了，各方面照顾得非常周到。医务主任从清早起来直到孩子生下来，这才离开产房。”
    第二天我到院探视，顺便到厕所去，看见收拾得很干净。张主任又告诉我：“孩子因产钳的关系头部受了些伤，经儿科王主任看过，一周后如无危险即可放心。”我开始感到：这种对病员的高度服务精神与热情是该院新生的开端，这个开端是由于该院医务工作者政治觉悟的提高和他们正视及改进以往的错误和缺点而来的。
    据一部分病员的反映：医院已经在各方面有了很大的改进，有些病员于转入别的疗养院后，又要求回来。
    我觉得该院全面的改进虽在开始，但目前这一些小小的成绩是值得我们珍视的。“作始也简，将毕也巨”，我希望华北人民医院全体同志能够加倍爱护这个新生的幼苗，使它一天一天发育壮大起来。
