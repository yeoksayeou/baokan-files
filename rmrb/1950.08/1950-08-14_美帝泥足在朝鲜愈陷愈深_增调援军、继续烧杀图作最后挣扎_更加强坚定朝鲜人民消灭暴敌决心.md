Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: The aggressive talons of U.S. imperialism are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of the Korean War.

Following the dispatch of its 1st Motorized Cavalry Division and 25th Infantry Division stationed in Japan to reinforce Korea on July 19th, U.S. imperialism has also dispatched the 1st Infantry Division and the 1st Marine Division from its own country to South Korea. These two divisions have been arriving in Korea successively since July 31st. Not long before this, the U.S. authorities also transferred parts of the U.S. military from Okinawa and Hawaii to Korea. The U.S. 24th Infantry Division, which had been completely annihilated, has been replenished, and MacArthur announced on July 30th the appointment of the former commander of U.S. forces in Korea, Church, who was dismissed for his disgraceful escape from Suwon, as the commander of the newly formed 24th Division.

In a month and a half of war, the Korean People's Army has liberated more than six-fifths of its South Korean territory. Faced with the unexpected strength of the Korean people, the New York Times had to admit in its August 4th editorial that the United States was facing a long and difficult war of "attrition" that it had not anticipated.

After retreating to a bridgehead around Busan, which accounts for less than one-sixth of the area of South Korea, the U.S. military is still in a passive and defensive position. U.S. military experts in Washington even dared not guarantee on August 6th that the U.S. military could avoid "another Dunkirk" retreat. They said: "If the enemy gets within range of heavy artillery, the American forces' position in Busan will soon be untenable" (Agence France-Presse).

Regarding the reasons for U.S. imperialism's stubborn insistence on this unfavorable war, Agence France-Presse, in a Washington dispatch of the 5th, stated: "For two reasons, U.S. military authorities will do everything possible to hold the Busan bridgehead: (1) Because the reaction to a disastrous defeat of the U.S. military in Korea would be unthinkable; (2) Because this matter may involve the issue of war and peace throughout the world (i.e., greatly undermining America's war deployment)." The New York Times editorial on the 4th also said: "Stalling the war is extremely important, because this makes it possible to mobilize a 'real United Nations army', and not just the United States and South Korean troops fighting for the 'United Nations'."

In order to carry out this so-called "stalling war," Walker, the commander of U.S. forces in Korea, withdrew all of his troops west of the Nakdong River to east of the Nakdong River starting on August 1st, attempting to avoid being defeated individually by relying on "natural barriers," "shortening the lines of defense," and concentrating forces. In the process of Walker's so-called "active retreat," he continued to carry out massacres. An Associated Press dispatch on August 2nd stated: "A series of villages are burning in the eighty-mile war zone from north of Jinju to Gimcheon, with smoke billowing throughout the area"; a United Press dispatch on the same day stated that cities such as Yecheon and Andong have been "engulfed in flames." The city of Gimcheon has also been set on fire.

United Press International reported on the 5th: "American commanders along the Nakdong River front ordered on Saturday (the 5th) that all Korean civilians in the area five to twenty miles behind the American lines must leave immediately... Any civilians active in this area may be shot on sight." U.S. imperialism is attempting to intimidate the Korean people with atrocities of burning and killing and creating no-man's-lands, and is vainly attempting to increase the difficulties of the Korean People's Army and guerrilla operations.

In recent days, Walker has driven his recently arrived U.S. troops to conduct local attacks on the southern end of the front line, attempting to ease the pressure on Busan from the People's Army. However, on the entire Korean front, although the U.S. military has concentrated a large number of troops (including puppet troops) in a small area, the initiative of the entire front line is still in the hands of the People's Army. The increase in U.S. reinforcements and the frenzied atrocities can only further strengthen the Korean people's determination to eliminate the vicious enemy.

### 美帝泥足在朝鲜愈陷愈深  增调援军、继续烧杀图作最后挣扎  更加强坚定朝鲜人民消灭暴敌决心

　　美帝泥足在朝鲜愈陷愈深
    增调援军、继续烧杀图作最后挣扎  更加强坚定朝鲜人民消灭暴敌决心
    【新华社十三日讯】美帝国主义的侵略魔足，正在愈来愈深地陷入于朝鲜战争的泥淖中。
    美帝国主义继七月十九日调其驻日本的第一摩托化骑兵师及步兵第二十五师增援朝鲜后，又自其本国调遣步兵第一师及海军陆战队第一师赴南朝鲜。这两师部队，自七月三十一日起，已陆续抵达朝鲜。前此不久，美当局还自冲绳岛和夏威夷各调美军一部到朝鲜。已被全部歼灭的美国步兵第二十四师已被补充起来，麦克阿瑟并于七月三十日宣布任命前因在水原狼狈逃跑而被撤职的第一任朝鲜美军司令邱奇，为新编的第二十四师的师长。
    在一个半月的战争中，朝鲜人民军已解放了其南朝鲜国土的六分之五以上。面临美国所没料想到的朝鲜人民的强大力量，纽约时报也不得不于八月四日的社论中承认美国已面临原先没有估计到的长期而艰难的“消耗”战。
    美军在退到占南朝鲜的面积不及六分之一的釜山周围的桥头堡垒后，仍然处于被动挨打的地位。华盛顿的美国军事专家甚至在八月六日还不敢保证美军能避免“再遇见一次敦刻尔克”的撤退。他们说：“假如敌人进到重炮的射程以内，美国军队在釜山的阵地很快地就会守不住了”（法新社）。
    关于美帝国主义顽强地坚持这一不利的战争的理由，据法新社华盛顿五日电称：“因为两种原因，使美国军事当局将尽他们的一切可能，来达到守住釜山桥头堡的目的：（一）因为美军在朝鲜的惨败，其反应将是不堪设想的；（二）因为这件事可能牵涉到全世界的和战问题（即大大打击了美国的战争布置）”。纽约时报四日的社论也说：“阻宕战是极端重要的，因为这样才有可能动员‘真正的联合国军队’，而不仅是美国和南朝鲜的军队在为‘联合国’而战”。
    为了进行这种所谓“阻宕战”，朝鲜美军司令瓦克曾于八月一日起，将其在洛东江以西的部队，全部撤到洛东江以东，企图以凭借“天险”、“缩短防线”、集中兵力的办法，避免被各个击破。瓦克在其所谓“主动撤退”的过程中，继续进行大烧杀。美联社八月二日消息称：“自晋州北至金泉之间的八十英里战区中，一连串的村庄在焚烧中，烟火腾腾，遍于全区”；合众社同日消息称：醴泉与安东等城已“陷入火海”。金泉城亦已被纵火焚烧。
    合众社五日又称：“洛东江战线沿线的美国指挥官们星期六（五日）命令所有沿美军阵线背后五英里到二十英里一带地区的朝鲜平民立即离开……任何在这地区内活动的平民，都可能一被看到就遭射杀”。美帝国主义企图以烧杀和制造无人区的暴行，来恫吓朝鲜人民，并妄图增加朝鲜人民军和游击队行动的困难。
    近数日来，瓦克又驱策其最近开到的美军，在战线南端进行局部攻击，图缓和人民军对釜山的压力。但在整个朝鲜前线上，尽管美军在狭小的地区集中了大量部队（包括伪军），整个战线的主动权仍然握在人民军手中。美国的增调援军和疯狂的暴行，只能更加坚定朝鲜人民消灭凶恶敌人的决心。
