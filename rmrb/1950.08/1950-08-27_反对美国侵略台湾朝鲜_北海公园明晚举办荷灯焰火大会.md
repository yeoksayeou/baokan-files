    Oppose American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea
    Beihai Park to Hold Lotus Lantern and Fireworks Festival Tomorrow Evening
    To oppose American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, Beihai Park has decided to hold a lotus lantern and fireworks festival on the evening of August 28 (the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, the Zhongyuan Festival) within the park. On that evening, the front and rear gates of the park, as well as all the paifangs (archways) within the park, will be decorated with colorful electric lights. From 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, 2,000 red and green lotus lanterns will be lit, along with over ten types of fireworks including "Ten Thousand Dragons Fire Umbrellas," "Five-Colored Golden Coins," "Hanging Parachutes," and "String Lights with Sounding Firecrackers." Reflected in the fireworks will be over ten electric light slogans such as "Oppose American Imperialist Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea," "Defend World Peace," and "Signing a Name is Equal to a Bullet." There will also be projections of images of Chairman Mao and Stalin. At the same time, the Beijing People's Art Theater has been invited to perform various novel musical pieces on a specially prepared large boat. Ticket prices will remain the same for the day, with no increase. To avoid overcrowding, the park will open small doors on the left and right sides of the front gate, as well as the large gate on the west side of Tuancheng, east of the Yuhe Bridge, and set up three temporary ticket booths. The side gate on the west side of the rear gate will also be opened, with a temporary ticket booth set up. The Zhishan Gate will be designated as an exit for the convenience of visitors.

    反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜
    北海公园明晚举办荷灯焰火大会
    北海公园为反对美国侵略台弯朝鲜，决定于八月二十八日晚（农历七月十五中元节），在海内举办荷灯焰火大会。是晚该园前后门及园内各牌坊、均按装五彩电灯，自下午八点起至十一点，燃放红绿荷花灯二千盏及万龙火伞、五色金钱、挂降落伞、串灯带乡起火等焰火十余种。其中并映照“反对美帝侵略台弯和朝鲜”、“保卫世界和平”、“签一个名，等于一颗子弹”，等十余条电光标语。日照出毛主席斯大林像片。同时北京市人民艺术剧院，应邀在专备之大船上，演奏各新颖音乐。是日票标照常，并不加价。该园为避免拥护，将前门增开左右小门及御河桥东头团城西边大门，并搭临时售票房三座；后门增开西旁门，搭临时售票处一座；陟山门辟为出口，方便游人。  （修一辙）
