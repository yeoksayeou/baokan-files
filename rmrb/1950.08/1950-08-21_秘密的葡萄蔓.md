　　The Secret Grapevine
    People have known for a long time that the British and American occupation authorities in West Germany have turned prisons for Nazi war criminals into very comfortable sanatoriums. Derek Valli, a reporter for the London Daily Mail, visited one such prison in Weil. There he saw Nazi generals such as Kesselring, Manstein, Mackensen, Falkenhorst, and Siemens, who not only lived very comfortably there, but were also able to communicate freely with the outside world.
    It is said that these generals, under the leadership of Kesselring, are writing a "History of their Campaigns" for the American military authorities. They not only provide their pathetic military experience to their American masters, but also lead the organization of German militarists in Western Europe. After meeting Kesselring, Derek Valli came to a belief:
    "This work of compiling the 'History of Campaigns' allows the war criminals in Weil to have the opportunity to contact their military colleagues outside. They are all connected to the secret grapevine. This secret grapevine is reconnecting the former officers of Hitler's Nazi army."
    In other words, the Weil prison is not just a sanatorium; it has become a kind of military headquarters. It is not protecting society from the harm of war criminals; on the contrary, it is protecting war criminals, allowing them to escape the sanctions of the public who are vehemently opposed to American imperialists' fostering the revival of German militarism.

　　秘密的葡萄蔓
    人们在很久以前就知道英美在西德的占领当局已把监禁纳粹战犯的监狱变为很舒适的休养所了。伦敦每日邮报记者德未尔曾访问了魏尔地方一个这样的监狱。在那里他见到了克塞林、曼斯坦、马根森、佛肯霍斯、西门等纳粹将军们，他们不仅在那里很舒适地生活着，而且还能很自由地与外界来往。
    据说，这些将领们在克塞林领导之下，正在给美国的军事当局写着一部他们的“征战史”。他们不仅把他们的可怜的军事经验供给美国主子，而且还在领导着在西欧的德国军国主义者的组织。德未尔在会晤了克塞林以后，得到了一个信念：
    “这编著‘征战史’的工作使在魏尔的战犯们得有与外面的军事同僚们联络的机会。他们都已连接到秘密的葡萄蔓上了。这秘密的葡萄蔓正在重把以前希特勒的纳粹军队的军官们联系在一起。”
    换句话说，魏尔监狱不只是个休养所，它已成一种军事大本营了。它不是保护着社会，使社会不受到战犯的侵害，相反地，它在保护着战犯，使他们逃脱了正在热烈反对美帝国主义者扶植德国军国主义复活的公众的制裁。
