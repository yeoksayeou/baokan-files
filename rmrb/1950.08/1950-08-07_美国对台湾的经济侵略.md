U.S. Economic Aggression Against Taiwan

I

Having suffered fifty years of enslavement under Japanese imperialism, the people of Taiwan, after the surrender of Japan, suffered the continued enslavement of U.S. imperialism and its agent, the Kuomintang bandit gang. Since 1945, the grasping hands of U.S. monopoly capital, with the help of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous clique, have taken complete control of Taiwan's economic lifeline, plunging the people of Taiwan into the miserable fate of complete colonization.

U.S. imperialism's economic aggression against Taiwan is multifaceted and all-pervasive. It controls Taiwan's industrial, mining, and agricultural production, and makes Taiwan's entire economic system dependent on the U.S.'s economic aggression system against Asian countries, especially on Japan.

II

After Japan's surrender, the U.S. sent many so-called "experts" to Taiwan to investigate resources, stepping up its economic aggression against Taiwan. In February 1948, newspapers in Nanjing reported that the U.S. had concluded an agreement with the Kuomintang bandit gang to "jointly develop" Taiwan, enabling the U.S. to control the exploitation of resources such as tin, oil, coal, gold, sulfur, tungsten, and antimony. The U.S. decided to provide the Kuomintang bandit gang with large amounts of capital and a large number of technicians. In June of the same year, the "U.S. Aid Technical Survey Team" headed by Stillman stayed in Taiwan for four days, investigating Taiwan's industrial, mining, railway, and water conservancy construction. In August, U.S. President's Special Envoy Wedemeyer went to Taiwan to "inspect," convening secret meetings and various specialized meetings with the heads of the Taiwan bandit departments and bureaus and the heads of the ten major companies of the pseudo-Resources Committee, studying specific plans for the U.S. to control Taiwan's economy. Before and after these conspiratorial activities, U.S. monopoly groups gradually controlled all of Taiwan's economic lifeline.

In terms of industry and mining, Reynolds, a subsidiary of the U.S. Second Aluminum Monopoly Company, signed a draft agreement with the Kuomintang bandit gang in February 1948 to "jointly operate" the Kaohsiung Aluminum Plant, stipulating that the U.S. would invest seven million U.S. dollars. Subsequently, the U.S. increased its investment to 35 million U.S. dollars, taking control of Taiwan's entire aluminum metal industry. To facilitate its monopolistic operation, the U.S. also shut down another large aluminum smelting plant in Hualien Port, Taiwan, causing 30,000 workers to lose their jobs. The sugar industry is Taiwan's largest industry, and the U.S. has sent many "consultants" to control the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, the largest sugar monopoly organization of the Taiwan bandit, investing huge amounts of capital in 1948 and 1950, thereby controlling most of Taiwan's sugar industry. It is estimated that more than 60 percent of the sugar factories in the province are in the hands of U.S. monopoly capitalists. The fertilizer industry, one of Taiwan's two major agricultural needs, is also monopolized by U.S. monopoly capitalists. In September 1948, a "Fertilizer Industry Technical Survey Team" headed by Schell Calkins, general manager of the American company Shenchang Yanghang and chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, flew to Taiwan for investigation and decided that the American company would "jointly operate" the Taiwan Fertilizer Company in Keelung with the bandit side. Subsequent news revealed that the American Fertilizer Association had monopolized the manufacturing of caustic soda in Taiwan, and two other American companies had also monopolized the manufacturing of other chemical fertilizers. Taiwan's electricity is completely controlled by the U.S. large monopoly company Westinghouse, which signed an agreement with the Taiwan Power Company to rebuild the power plants destroyed by U.S. aircraft during World War II and increase their power generation. Currently, the U.S. company has taken control of a large portion of the 34 power plants in the province, including one of the largest power plants near Tainan. In addition to the above four major industries and mines, the U.S. Oil Company has also obtained the exclusive right to oil refining in southern Taiwan, the U.S. Transport Company dominates Taiwan's cement industry, and other industries such as camphor, papermaking, and salt production are also largely controlled by U.S. monopoly capitalists. There are also 382 industrial and commercial enterprises directly or indirectly controlled by 22 companies jointly operated by Kuomintang bureaucratic capital and the U.S., in which the Kuomintang bureaucratic capital accounts for only a very small portion.

Through the activities of the so-called "Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction," the U.S. also controls Taiwan's agricultural production, making it a purely colonial-type economy. The U.S. first controlled the production and marketing of chemical fertilizers, which are indispensable for Taiwan's agricultural production, selling fertilizers to farmers at extremely high prices and carrying out excessive exploitation. The U.S. also colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang to form most of the 72 percent of the land in the province forcibly occupied by the bandit gang into so-called "cooperative farms," using U.S. machinery and the labor force of the Taiwanese people to carry out serf-like production. At the same time, like the methods adopted by Britain and the Netherlands in Malaya and Indonesia, the U.S. also encouraged Taiwan's one-sided development in agriculture. Most of the land is planted with sugarcane and camphor, which are most beneficial to the U.S. monopoly groups, thus affecting the production of rice and other grains. Taiwan was originally a rice-producing area, but now the people are forced to fill their stomachs with sweet potato leaves and the like. The purpose of this poisonous method by the U.S. is to strengthen Taiwan's economic dependence on the U.S.

Stevens, head of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration in South Korea, said at a business symposium between the Taiwan bandit and South Korea on April 12 this year that the current "non-Communist countries" (referring to the U.S.'s puppet states) should strengthen their ties with each other, "develop multilateral trade, exchange materials with each other, and seek self-sufficiency." Muir, chief representative of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration in Taiwan, also emphasized at the meeting that countries should exchange "inexpensive to manufacture" materials to strengthen their own economies. These two agents of the U.S. implementing economic aggression revealed the true intentions of the U.S. monopoly group. This is to use the rich resources and cheap labor of various countries to make "inexpensive to manufacture" products and make big money; at the same time, to form an economic system of colonies under U.S. control, so that countries are interdependent, complementary, and dependent on the U.S.

Taiwan was occupied by Japan for a long time in the past, and its economy was a colonial economy serving Japan. Today, the U.S. is supporting Japan in Asia, and is using the old system in economics, so that Taiwan's economy still serves the Japanese economy.

After Japan's surrender, the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang transported a large amount of sugar and salt to Japan. According to the available materials, from Japan's surrender to October 1949, Taiwan sugar exports reached more than 730,000 tons, most of which were transported to Japan. In 1948 and 1949 alone, five batches totaling 270,000 tons were transported to Japan. Before 1950, when the U.S. occupation authorities had not yet opened private trade in Japan, Taiwan sugar sales to Japan were directly contracted by the Taiwan bandit and the U.S. occupation authorities, and the prices were all determined by the latter. In order to maintain this colonial-type export, the Taiwan bandit intensified its exploitation of Taiwan's sugarcane farmers. According to the head of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation on October 13 last year: "In order to maintain Taiwan sugar's 'competition' with various countries in the international market, it is necessary to reduce production costs, and the company has decided to start with agricultural affairs..." The so-called "starting with agricultural affairs," according to the explanation of this "head," is to force farmers to grow more sugarcane on the one hand; but on the other hand, the Taiwan bandit implements a low-price unified purchase policy, so that most sugarcane farmers work hard all year round, and cannot even get enough to eat. Taiwan salt exports to Japan reached 250,000 tons in 1949 alone, but because salt is not as profitable as sugar, and transportation tools are lacking, it does not seem as good as sugar exports. In addition to the above two major exports, the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang also exported minerals, jute, bananas, etc. to Japan. According to Shao Yizhou, commercial attache of the bandit's delegation in Japan, in 1949, the total amount of Taiwan's export trade to Japan reached 30 million U.S. dollars. This year, after the U.S. occupation authorities opened private trade in Japan, the Kuomintang remnants have stepped up their trade with Japan, first drafting the so-called "Taiwan-Japan Trade Agreement Draft" and sending people to Japan in May to discuss it. Prior to this, the Taiwan bandit also proposed to the U.S. occupation authorities to allow Japanese businessmen to go directly to Taiwan for trade. This "proposal" was immediately "welcomed" by Hale, deputy chief of the trade section of MacArthur's headquarters.

IV

The U.S. imperialists' economic aggression against Taiwan is carried out through the Kuomintang traitorous clique, and the Kuomintang bandit gang gets a share of the pie in the extreme exploitation of the people of Taiwan. Seeing all these facts, all patriotic Chinese will understand this truth, that the U.S. aggression against Taiwan is a long-standing policy of U.S. imperialism attempting to turn Taiwan into a U.S. colony. This direct and open aggression against Taiwan by U.S. imperialism is the result of its consistent behavior. The task of the Chinese people today is to fully prepare their strength, resolutely liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Kuomintang bandit gang, and end the U.S. colonial enslavement of Taiwan.

### 美国对台湾的经济侵略

　　美国对台湾的经济侵略
  一
    遭受日本帝国主义五十年奴役的台湾人民，在日本投降以后，又遭受了美帝国主义及其代理人国民党匪帮的继续奴役。一九四五年以来，美国独占资本的魔手，借国民党反动卖国集团的帮助，全盘控制了台湾的经济命脉，使台湾人民陷入了完全殖民地化的悲惨厄运。
    美帝国主义对台湾的经济侵略是多方面的，无孔不入的。它控制了台湾的工矿及农业生产，并使台湾的整个经济体系依附于美国对亚洲各国的经济侵略体系，特别是依附于日本。
  二
    日本投降以后，美国就派出很多所谓“专家”前往台湾调查资源，加紧展开了对台湾的经济侵略。一九四八年二月间南京报纸载，美国已与国民党匪帮缔结了《共同开发》台湾的协定，使美国能够控制锡、石油、煤、黄金、硫磺、钨、锑等资源的开采。美国决定以大量资本和大批技术人员供给国民党匪帮。同年六月，以史蒂尔曼为首的“美援技术调查团”曾停留台湾四日，调查了台湾的工矿、铁路和水利建设等。八月，美国总统特使魏德迈前往台湾“视察”，曾召集台匪各厅处局长和伪资源委员会十大公司负责人举行秘密会议及各种专门会议，研究美国控制台湾经济的具体方案。在这一些阴谋活动的前后，美国独占集团逐渐地控制了全台湾的一切经济命脉。
    在工矿业方面，美国第二铝业独占公司雷诺主属公司于一九四八年二月间与国民党匪帮签订了“合办”高雄铝厂的草约，规定美国投资七百万美元，随后美国更增加投资至三千五百万美元，掌握了全台湾的铝金属工业。为了方便其独占经营，美国并将台湾花莲港的另一大炼铝工厂停办，造成了三万工人的失业。蔗糖工业是台湾最大的工业，美国曾派出“顾问”多人，控制了台匪最大的糖业独占组织台湾糖业公司，一九四八年及一九五○年都曾投入巨量资本，因而控制了台湾糖业的大部分。据估计，全省糖厂百分之六十以上都掌握在美国独占资本家手里。作为台湾农业两大需要之一的肥料工业也为美国独占资本家所垄断。一九四八年九月间，由美商慎昌洋行总经理兼上海美商公会主席谢尔凯为首的“肥料工业技术调查小组”曾飞台湾进行调查，当决定由美商与匪方“合办”基隆的台湾肥料公司。据后续消息透露，美国肥料协会已经垄断了台湾洋碱的制造，其他两家美国公司也垄断了其他化学肥料的制造。台湾的电力完全被美国大独占公司威斯丁豪公司所控制，这个独占公司与台湾电力公司订立了一个协定，重建在第二次世界大战中遭美机炸毁的电力厂并增加其发电力。目前该美国公司已掌握了全省三十四个电力厂的一大半，包括台南附近一家最大的电力厂在内。除了以上四项主要工矿业以外，美国油脂公司还获得台省南部炼油的独占权利，美国通运公司统治了台省的水泥工业，其他樟脑、造纸、制盐等工业也大部为美国独占资本家统制着。还有三百八十二家工商企业，直接或间接受二十二家国民党官僚资本与美国合办的公司所控制，在这些合办公司中，国民党官僚资本只占极少的一部分。
    通过所谓“中美农村复兴联合委员会”的活动，美国还控制了台湾的农业生产，使之成为纯粹的殖民地型经济。美国首先控制了台湾农业生产中不可缺少的化学肥料的生产和运销，以极高的价格将肥料出卖给农民，进行了超额的剥削。美国又与国民党匪帮勾结，将匪帮强占的全省土地百分之七十二的土地中的大部分组成所谓“合作的农场”，利用美国的机械及台湾人民的劳动力，进行农奴式的生产。同时，像英国、荷兰等在马来亚和印尼所采取的办法一样，美国还鼓励台湾在农业上的片面发展。大部分的土地都种植对美国独占集团最有利的甘蔗和樟脑，因此影响了食米和其他谷物的生产。台湾本来是产米之区，但是现在人民却被迫以甘薯叶等充饥。美国这种毒辣的手段，目的就在加强台湾经济对美国的依赖性。
  三
    美国经济合作总署驻南韩负责人斯蒂文斯今年四月十二日在台匪与南韩的商务座谈会上说，目前“非共党区国家”（按即指美国各傀儡国家）应互相加强联系，“发展多边贸易，互相交换物资，而求自用”。美国经合署驻台湾首席代表穆懿尔亦在会上强调各国应互相交换“制造成本低廉”之物资，以强化本身经济。美国施行经济侵略的这两个代理人道出了美国独占集团的真实意图。这就是利用各国丰富的资源和贱价的劳动力，制成“成本低廉”的产品，大赚其钱；同时，组成在美国控制下的殖民地的经济体系，使各国相互依赖，相互补充，而依赖于美国。
    台湾过去长期为日本占领，它的经济是为日本服务的殖民地化经济。今天美国在亚洲正扶持日本，在经济上沿用旧的一套体系，使台湾经济仍服务于日本经济。
    日本投降以后，台湾国民党匪帮即以大批糖、盐输往日本。仅据已有的材料显示，自日本投降至一九四九年十月，台糖外销达七十三万多吨，其中大部分输往日本，仅一九四八年及一九四九年两年中就输往日本五批共二十七万吨。在一九五○年以前，美国对日本占领当局尚未开放日本私人贸易，台糖销日乃由台匪与美国占领当局直接订立合约，价格全由后者决定。台匪为了维持这种殖民地化的输出，于是加紧了对台湾蔗农的剥削。据台湾糖业公司负责人去年十月十三日谈：“为维持台糖在国际市场与各国‘竞争’，必须降低生产成本，公司已决定从农务着手……。”所谓“从农务着手”，据这个“负责人”的解释，就是一方面强迫农民多种甘蔗；但另一方面台匪却施行低价统购政策，以致使多数蔗农终岁勤苦，而不能一饱。台盐的输日，仅一九四九年即达二十五万吨，只是因为盐不如糖有利，且运输工具缺乏，所以看来不如糖的输出。除了以上两项大宗输出外，台湾国民党匪帮还对日输出矿石、黄麻、香蕉等。据匪驻日代表团商务处长邵逸周称，一九四九年，台湾对日输出贸易总额达美元三千万元。今年美国对日占领当局开放日本私人贸易后，国民党残匪更加紧展开对日本的贸易，首先拟定了所谓“台日贸易协定草案”，派人于五月间携往日本商谈。在此以前，台匪并向美国占领当局提议准许日本商人直接赴台湾贸易。这一“提议”立刻得到麦克阿瑟总部贸易课副课长海尔的“欢迎”。
  四
    美帝国主义者对台湾的经济侵略是通过国民党卖国集团来执行的，国民党匪帮则在对台湾人民的极度榨取中分得一杯羹。看到这一切事实，一切有爱国心的中国人都会明白这一道理，即美国侵略台湾的行动是由来已久的美帝国主义妄图把台湾变为美国殖民地的政策。美帝国主义这一次直接公开地侵略台湾就是它的一贯行为的结果。中国人民今天的任务，就是充分准备力量，坚决解放台湾，消灭国民党匪帮，结束美国对台湾的殖民地奴役。
