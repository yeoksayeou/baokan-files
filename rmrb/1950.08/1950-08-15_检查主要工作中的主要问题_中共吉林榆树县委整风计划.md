　　Checking the Main Problems in Key Work
    ——Rectification Plan of the Yushu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Jilin Province
    (Editor's note: So far, among the rectification plans of county committees and even prefectural committees that we have seen, a large portion are extremely general and empty. It is difficult to discern from these plans what the rectification focus of these counties is, and what specific steps are taken to ensure the implementation of the principle of close integration with work. The worst of these is simply repeating or summarizing the higher-level rectification instructions and rectification reports, or adding some fragmented facts. But what role can such rectification plans play in checking, summarizing, and improving the work of the region or department? It is difficult to imagine. The rectification plan of the Yushu County Committee is relatively good, as it not only grasped several key tasks and the main problems in these tasks, but also stipulated the specific steps to realize the plan: what kind of meetings to hold, what problems to check and solve, and what documents related to work to study and check separately. This initially guarantees that the rectification can be closely integrated with the current main work. However, there are still some aspects in this plan that the county committee should pay attention to and improve: First, the last sentence of item two of the plan says that rectification work should be placed in a certain position. This statement is not enough. Since the beginning of the rectification, it should be regarded as the primary work or one of the important tasks. Rectification is the key to improving all work. Second, after checking various tasks, it is necessary to make a summary, formulate specific plans to correct deviations and overcome difficulties, and improve work at any time. The Jilin Provincial Committee has already clearly pointed this out after reviewing the county's plan.)
    I. The number of Party members in Yushu County has greatly increased in the two years of production and construction. In the past two years, some ideological deviations have occurred among Party members and cadres. Under the leadership of the Provincial Committee, through the struggle against agricultural socialist ideology, against lack of organization and discipline and peaceful enjoyment, the launch of the comprehensive model worker movement, the study of documents reporting the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, etc., the ideological situation within the Party has improved, and the county's economic construction work has gradually unfolded. The current situation of cadres in the county is: they are full of energy, but their policy and professional level is poor. In the current rural work, there is a serious problem of wide coverage, shallow roots, development of surface work, and lack of in-depth work. Various aspects of work cannot be organically coordinated with the central task. Formalism, commandism, and some blindness in work have also grown in economic construction and award campaigns. Therefore, a mass rectification movement must be carried out to systematically and effectively resolve these most prominent errors. Naturally, other serious errors must also be corrected around this central task, so as to unite the people of the county under the leadership of the Party and further advance the county's economic construction work.
    II. In order to achieve the above requirements, this rectification should be combined with the current work. Documents should be read, work should be summarized, the situation should be analyzed, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out to solve the policy viewpoints of key cadres and the issues of implementing the mass line and work methods. Throughout the entire rectification movement, attention should be paid to combining it with seasonal rural work. Before the autumn harvest, in addition to regular work, we must complete the construction of the Yu (Yushu) Tao (Lairui Zhao) Railway, accumulate green manure, exchange winter wheat sowing experience, reorganize cooperatives, and conduct centralized training for cadres above the village and commune levels. After the autumn harvest, there will be more arduous tasks, such as the collection of public grain, the supply and marketing of materials, and the larger-scale taxation and winter study work. Therefore, the rectification plans and work plans of the county level and various districts and units should pay attention to these situations and determine their own methods and steps. However, we should not stop work and adopt hasty and impulsive methods to solve ideological problems, but should proceed according to the time stipulated by the Provincial Committee, rather slow than chaotic. In addition, it is also necessary to note that we must not neglect rectification on the pretext of heavy workload; or become tired and slack due to the long time. Leaders must be responsible, take the lead, and gradually deepen the rectification movement. This is an important key to improving future work and should be placed in a certain position.
    III. To adapt to the seasonal work characteristics of the countryside in the six months from now to the end of the year, we will proceed as follows:
    (1) First, rectify the county committee leaders, the heads of various departments and commissions, and Party member cadres above the section chief level. In order to do this work well, the following meetings need to be held:
    1. Agricultural Conference (July 15 - August 9, a few days should be set aside depending on the situation), focusing on checking: (1) organizing mutual aid teams; (2) improving agricultural technology and promoting new agricultural tools; (3) policies for individual farmers; (4) the planning of agricultural production, and the mass line in leading agricultural production; (5) the issue of expanded reproduction.
    Before the meeting, read Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC on June 6: "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation," and Comrade Gao Gang's report at the First Congress of the CPC Northeast Bureau: "Standing at the Forefront of Northeast Economic Construction" regarding the issue of developing agricultural production and the two parts of the whole Party uniting to stand at the forefront of economic construction. The CPC Central Committee's "Decision on Leadership Methods," Stalin's "On Leadership and Inspection," "On Self-Criticism," Mao Zedong's "On Self-Criticism," "Combat Liberalism," and refer to the county's economic construction plan to check the work of the past year.
    2. Conference on the Issue of Mass Burden (August 10 - August 20, a few days should be set aside depending on the situation), check the work of taxation, public grain, and public bonds, and focus on checking the phenomenon of uneven burden and coercive command style in the implementation of burden policies. Read Comrade Bo Yibo's report on adjusting tax issues at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman Gao Gang's speech at the Northeast Cadre Conference (published in the Northeast Daily - January 28, 1949) and the report "To Whom Does the Honor Belong".
    3. Commercial Conference (August 21 - September 10, a few days should be set aside depending on the situation), check the work of cooperatives, state-owned commerce, and state-owned enterprises, and focus on adjusting the relationship between public and private, the contract system, etc., and the mass line in the development of cooperatives. Read Comrade Chen Yun's report at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference "On the Economic Situation, Adjusting Industry and Commerce, and Adjusting Taxation". Liu Shaoqi's speech at the cadre meeting celebrating May Day in Beijing.
    4. Organization Conference (September 15 - September 30, a few days should be set aside depending on the situation), focusing on checking the ideological construction of the Party in rural areas, reward and punishment issues, and the relationship between the Party and the masses. Read Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party" in the mass line section.
    In short, this rectification is not a closed-door rectification, but is carried out through in-depth inspection of the work of departments and individuals. To promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, so that the county committee and responsible comrades of various departments can clarify the main policies in the current work and the methods of implementing these policies.
    (2) In October, train district secretaries, district chiefs, and cooperative directors in a rectification training class. Methods and steps: Make rectification inspection reports and read documents, inspire everyone to check the work of the county, and then conduct inspections and summaries of the work of each district separately. Personal self-criticism should be combined with the inspection of work.
    (3) The rectification of general cadres in various county agencies and departments can be carried out in October.
    (4) The rectification of general cadres in various districts and village branch secretaries can be carried out in November and December by holding training classes separately.
    IV. In the rectification movement, various work should be checked in conjunction with the convening of the Party Congress and the People's Representative Conference. The following issues should be noted when convening these meetings:
    (1) When summarizing and checking issues related to the broad masses, such as the relationship between the Party and the masses, agricultural production, supply and marketing work, and the burden of the masses, the opinions of the masses should be absorbed to make the rectification more in-depth. The convening of such meetings should be decided separately according to the needs of current work and rectification.
    (2) Before convening these meetings, not only should the leadership be prepared, but the agenda should also be determined in advance so that the representatives are also prepared for in-depth discussion.
    (3) People's Representative Conferences should generally not be convened solely for rectification purposes, but should also have their own work.
    (4) The quality of the meeting lies in the ability to fully promote democracy at the conference.

### 检查主要工作中的主要问题  ——中共吉林榆树县委整风计划

　　检查主要工作中的主要问题
    ——中共吉林榆树县委整风计划
    （编者按：截至目前为止，在我们所看到的县委的以至地委的整风计划中，有很大一部分是极其一般与空洞的。在这些计划中很难看出这些县的整风重点是什么，以及采取什么样的具体步骤以保证贯彻密切结合工作的方针。其中最恶劣的是把上级整风指示和整风报告摘要或重述一遍，或再加上一些片断的零碎的事实。可是这样的整风计划，对检查、总结、改进本地区本部门的工作究竟有多大的作用呢？这是令人很难想像的。中共榆树县县委的整风计划是比较好的，不但抓住了几项主要工作，和这些工作中的主要问题。并且规定了实现计划的具体步骤：召开什么样的会议，检查与解决什么样的问题，以及分别学习与检查工作有关的文件。这样初步保证了整风能与当前主要工作密切结合进行。但是这个计划中还有些值得该县县委注意改进的地方：第一，计划第二项最后说，应将整风工作放在一定位置上。这样的说法是不够的。既然在整风开始以后，就应当把整风工作当作首要工作或重要工作之一。整风是改进一切工作的关键。第二，各项工作检查后，必须作出总结，制定纠正偏向克服困难的具体方案，并随时改进工作。这一点吉林省委在审阅该县计划后已经明确指出。）
    一、榆树县的党员，在两年的生产建设中，已有很大发展。二年来，在党员干部中曾产生过若干思想偏向。在省委领导下，经过反对农业社会主义思想，反对无组织无纪律及和平享乐的斗争，全面劳模运动的展开，对二中全会报道文件的学习等等，因此党内思想状况已有改进，全县经济建设工作因而逐步展开。现在全县干部的情况是：干劲足，但政策业务水平差。在目前农村工作严重的存在着铺底宽，札根浅，有面的展开，缺乏点的深入。各方面工作尚不能有机的与中心任务配合。在经济建设工作和评奖运动中，也滋长了形式主义，命令主义和若干工作中的盲目性。因之必须通过一种群众性的整风运动，才能对当前这些最突出的错误给以有系统的有效的解决。自然对其他性质严重的错误，也必须环绕这一中心加以纠正，以便在党的领导下，团结全县人民，把全县经济建设工作推进一步。
    二、为实现以上要求，这次整风应结合当前工作进行。应阅读文件，总结工作，分析情况，展开批评与自我批评，以解决主要干部的政策观点及贯彻政策之群众路线与工作方法问题。在整个整风运动中，应该注意结合季节性的农村工作。我们在秋收前，除经常工作外，要完成修建榆（树）陶（赖昭）铁路，积压绿肥，交流冬麦播种经验，合作社的整理，和村社以上的干部的集训。在秋后将有更繁重的工作，如公粮的征收，物资的供销，以及更大范围的税收、冬学工作等。因之县级与各区各单位的整风计划与工作计划，应注意这些情况，确定自己的方法和步骤。但不应以停止工作采取急躁突击的方式来解决思想问题，而应按省委规定时间进行，宁慢不乱。另外，亦需注意：不得借口工作繁重而忽视整风；或因时间较长而流于疲塌。必须首长负责，亲自动手，将整风运动逐步深入。这是有关提高今后工作的重要关键，应把它放在一定位置上。
    三、为适应从现在到年底这半年农村季节性工作特点，我们进行步骤如下：
    （一）首先整县委领导，各部委、各局、科长以上党员干部。为了把这个工作作好，需开好下列几个会议：
    １、农业会议（七月十五日——八月九日酌情抽出几天时间召开之），着重检查：（１）组织互助组；（２）改进农业技术，推广新农具；（３）对单干户的政策；（４）农业生产的计划性问题，以及领导农业生产中群众路线问题；（５）扩大再生产问题。
    会前阅读毛主席六月六日在中共七届三中全会上的报告：“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”，高岗同志在中共东北区第一次代表会上的报告：“站在东北经济建设的最前面”之关于发展农业生产的问题及全党团结起来站在经济建设的最前面两部分。中共中央《关于领导方法的决定》，斯大林《论领导与检查》，《论自我批评》，毛泽东同志《论自我批评》，《反对自由主义》，及参考本县经济建设方案，检查一年来的工作。
    ２、关于群众负担问题会议（从八月十日——二十日酌情抽出几天时间召开之），检查税收、公粮、公债等工作，并着重检查执行负担政策中的畸轻畸重现象和强迫命令作风。阅读薄一波同志在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上关于调整税收问题的报告，高岗主席在东北干部会议上的讲演（载东北日报——一九四九年一月二十八日）和《荣誉是属于谁的》报告。
    ３、商业会议（从八月二十一日——九月十日酌情抽出几天时间召开之），检查合作社、国家商业、国营企业工作，并着重调整公私关系、合同制等以及发展合作社中的群众路线问题。阅读陈云同志在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上《关于经济形势、调整工商业和调整税收诸问题》的报告。刘少奇同志在北京庆祝五一劳动节干部大会上的演说。
    ４、组织会议（九月十五日——三十日酌情抽出几天时间召开之），着重检查农村党的思想建设问题，奖惩问题，党群关系问题。阅读刘少奇同志《论党》中的群众路线部分。
    总之，我们这次整风，不是关门整风，而是通过深入检查部门和个人的工作来进行。以发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，使县委和各部门负责同志弄清当前工作中的主要政策，及贯彻这些政策的方法。
    （二）十月份以整风训练班方式集训区书、区长、合作社主任。方法和步骤：作整风检查报告和阅读文件，启发大家检查全县工作，然后分别进行各区工作的检查与总结。个人检讨结合检查工作进行。
    （三）县各机关部门之一般干部之整风，可在十月份进行之。
    （四）各区一般干部及各村支书之整风，可于十一、十二月份分别召开训练班进行之。
    四、整风运动中，应结合召开党代会，人民代表会议检查各种工作。召开这些会议时，应注意下列问题：
    （一）在总结检查有关广大群众的问题时，如属党群关系，农业生产，供销工作，群众负担等问题，应吸收群众意见，使整风更加深入。这类会议之召集，应根据当前工作与整风之需要，分别决定之。
    （二）召开这些会议之前，不仅领导上要有所准备，并应事先确定议题，使代表也有准备，以便深入讨论。
    （三）人民代表会议，一般不宜单纯为整风而召开，还应有它本身的工作。
    （四）会议之好坏，在于能够在大会上充分发扬民主。
