　　"The Azure Road" is a Beautiful Film
    Yuan Shuibai
    The war is over,
    But we are still on the battlefield.
    The enemy lays terrible mines,
    On the dark seabed rocks.
    When you go to capture them,
    You must be brave and resourceful;
    And remember well,
    There is no second chance if you make a mistake.
    Minelayers, minelayers, minelayers,
    We are friends of the waves,
    We face the vast ocean,
    Fighting on the azure road.
     ——Excerpt from the film's theme song (approximate)

    During the Soviet-German War, the German invaders used mines to blockade the ports along the Black Sea coast. After the war, these remaining mines threatened the safety of Soviet merchant ships. The extra distance traveled by national ships to bypass mine areas cost 250,000 nautical miles annually. If ships accidentally detonated mines, it would bring enormous losses of life and property to the country. Therefore, mine clearance work became one of the important projects in the Soviet Union's peaceful construction. The film "The Azure Road" (note) depicts the Red Navy's mine-clearing operations in the mine area of ​​the port of Odessa. It successfully portrays the noble morals and heroic actions of the Soviet people; during the period of peaceful construction, as in wartime, they demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity in struggle and work; they possessed a strong will to overcome all difficulties and a spirit of patriotism and optimism.

    In addition to searching for mines and detonating them, the Navy also had a mission: to discover the enemy's secrets of manufacturing new types of mines. This required risking one's life to dismantle the mines, disassembling their components from the outside to the inside for research. The film vigorously depicts the difficulty and danger of mine clearance and mine dismantling work, thus more vividly highlighting the heroism of the minelayers dedicating themselves to the motherland.

    The film's protagonist, Third-Rank Captain Latanov, had been approved by the government for demobilization and could resume his pre-war position as a merchant ship captain. But he voluntarily contributed himself more to the motherland. When the fleet found a new type of acoustic magnetic mine that had been dormant for three years, two opinions arose in the fleet: one opinion was that it would be better to detonate and destroy it than to risk dismantling it; the other opinion was that although detonation was important, dismantling was even more important. Because without dismantling it, the enemy's military secrets could not be revealed. The Third-Rank Captain insisted on the latter opinion and bravely requested to be assigned this task. He stated that if misfortune occurred, others could continue his work and dismantle the second, third… mine. Even sacrifice is worthwhile: people can absorb the experiences of their predecessors, revise methods, continue to work, and ultimately achieve victory. The film tells us that his opinion was completely correct.

    But our protagonist is not a reckless and brave character; his bravery is combined with wisdom. The filmmakers, through the words of the Third-Rank Captain, tell the audience that success cannot rely on luck, and lucky success is not glorious. The film emphasized his fortitude and boldness when doing dismantling work, while also not neglecting his careful consideration beforehand... He often suffered from insomnia calculating the location of buried mines, sometimes working until four in the morning. It is not enough to have only a selfless spirit of not fearing sacrifice; hard work and tireless research are also needed.

    From beginning to end, the film depicts the thrilling nature of the combat mission, while also interweaving the love between Third-Rank Captain Latanov and his wife and the happiness of their family life. From this contradictory and unified portrayal of personal happiness and collective happiness, the audience recognizes how accurately the Soviet people treat the relationship between personal and revolutionary interests, showing the beautiful qualities of the most advanced people in the Soviet era, who place the interests of the people and the interests of the country above everything else, making personal happiness subordinate to collective happiness. And so-called personal happiness is also so inextricably intertwined within the collective. After risking his life to complete the task, the Third-Rank Captain said to his wife: "Only now do I feel how lovable I am..." (approximate) Then he added that he would further improve his work next time—"Next time I will cut the red wire..." (approximate)—the wife replied to him: "You will never be satisfied with yourself..." In these places, the film fully demonstrates all aspects of the rich spiritual life of the Soviet people.

    The film meticulously portrays Naga's inner conflicts. The thoughts and emotions of the captain and his wife are not always completely consistent. Of course, they are both new people, and Naga is also a person with a revolutionary worldview. But because the captain has received more training, there are some differences. Naga, who appears in the film, is always worried about her husband's safety, and sometimes even not very satisfied with his work. But she always restrains her weaknesses and constantly improves herself.

    For example, the film depicts Naga teaching in school. When elementary school students mention the terrifying nature of mines, she hears the rumbling of trucks downstairs, which stirs up her worries, and she inadvertently loses her composure. But she immediately pulls herself together and criticizes the student's words as incorrect. During a walk, Naga mentioned to her husband that other people can have peaceful and happy lives, but she still has to worry and be afraid, as if living in "wartime." Latanov once again encourages her. Once, she even imagined that one day, her husband would really never return. She was waiting at home when she suddenly heard a knock on the door. A sailor reporting the bad news came in, "He slowly took off his hat to me..." At this time, the film clearly depicts Naga's expression of fear and grief. But the husband's calm voice repeatedly overcomes Naga's fear. He said, "Be bold! Be brave! As long as you are brave, difficulties will not exist!" The Third-Rank Captain's impression on the audience is not only one aspect of being brave and fearless; he is very understanding, considerate, and loves his wife. But he insists on fighting without wavering. His strong will and unlimited loyalty to the motherland influence his wife, making her stronger time and time again. …Through these portrayals of life and psychology with contradictions, struggles, and twists and turns, the characters we recognize in the film appear to be comprehensive, whole, and believable, rather than one-sided, rigid, and empty. The author profoundly excavated and expressed the various sides and stages of development of the characters' inner ups and downs. This creative method neither deviates from the reality of life and purely manufactures characters and plots based on political concepts; nor does it mean indiscriminately piling up details. Rather, it reflects real life in a more concentrated and refined way, making the theme of the work both profoundly educational and very convincing.

    The scene of the Third-Rank Captain dismantling the mine is the climax of the film. This scene is handled very vividly. The audience, like the members of the committee observing the mine dismantling work on the screen, held their breath and stared at a silent tent in the distance. The mine was hanging in the tent, and Latanov and his assistant were unscrewing it bolt by bolt. The tense situation inside the tent, where people were sweating profusely, was invisible from outside the tent. From afar, only the wind blowing the curtain could be seen, and a corner of the cloth was slightly fluttering, appearing silent and unfathomable. Using the difference between the appearance and the interior of things to create a strong contrast is a rather clever technique. The members of the committee stared unblinkingly at this mysterious tent, not even shifting their gaze to light a cigarette; and the successive addition of screws on the table reflected on the screen; and the movement of the hands of the clock from morning to afternoon… These few shots strongly grabbed the audience's attention, and therefore fully expressed the ideological content of the work.

    The sincere love between the Soviet people, especially between superiors and subordinates, is also fully reflected in this scene. In the meeting to discuss the dismantling of the mine, the First-Rank Captain, who deeply loved his subordinates, after a long period of bowing his head and pondering, finally approved the Third-Rank Captain's suggestion, stood up solemnly and faced him to utter the three words "Execute it!". During the execution of the task, the close and serious relationship between the Third-Rank Captain and his assistant Sergeant was even more movingly portrayed. The captain wanted to cut the wire inside the mine, but didn't know which one to cut first. He knew that cutting this wire might cause an immediate explosion, so he wanted to move his assistant away from his side. The gist of that dialogue is:

    "Comrade Sergeant, please move further away, I am going to cut this wire."
    "No, Comrade Third-Rank Captain, I am a minelayer, let me do this work, this is my task."
    "Comrade Sergeant, I am also a minelayer, this is also my task."

    Finally, the Third-Rank Captain used an order to instruct him to leave the work site, and the Sergeant had to leave. But he was still worried and unwilling to go far, still lingering outside the tent where the captain was working, guarding and protecting his superior, in case something happened. Sure enough, as soon as the wire was cut, the mine exploded immediately, and Latanov was knocked down. Ignoring the danger, Sergeant rushed into the tent, picked up the captain, and ran out, saving him from danger.

    Before this, when the Sergeant was guarding near the tent, another assistant also came. Knowing the danger of the situation, the Sergeant immediately told him to run away, just as the captain had told him to run away. This combination of the relationship between superiors and subordinates, mutual love, and adherence to principles is very moving. This bond of love unites the Soviet people into a strong collective. How can such a collective, such a people, not be victorious!

    The director used a still shot to capture a profile of the Sergeant in the tent, his tense facial muscles, protruding jaw, and wide eyes intently watching the captain's movements... This portrait is beautiful. Although this is not a unique technique, it is used appropriately here. I remember that there were similar close-up shots in "The Great Turn". The head of the truck driver who died on the front line with the telephone wire in his mouth also remained on the screen for several seconds, giving the audience room for thought and leaving an indelible impression. Movie shots are generally continuous and rapidly changing actions. Occasionally inserting a completely still shot of a character, like a sculpture, is a wonderful way of expression and has a certain help in expressing the theme.

    Although "The Azure Road" is not a giant work that records a major battle or a major historical event, its scale is small, but it has profound ideological content and positive educational significance, and it is full of life and lyrical elements. It is a refined work of art.

　　《蔚蓝色的道路》是一部优美的电影
    袁水拍
    战争已经结束，
    我们却依旧身在战场。
    敌人敷设着可怕的水雷，
    在阴暗的海底的岩石上。
    当你去捕捉它的时候，
    你要勇敢和机智；
    并且要牢牢记住，
    一回弄错可没有第二次。
    水雷手，水雷手，水雷手，
    我们是波浪的朋友，
    我们面对着辽阔的海洋，
    在蔚蓝色的道路上战斗。
     ——片中插曲（大意）
    在苏德战争期间，德寇用水雷封锁了黑海沿岸各港口。战争结束后，这些遗留下来的水雷威胁着苏联商船的安全。全国船只为了绕越水雷区域而多耗费的航程，每年达二十五万海里。船只如果误触水雷，更给国家带来生命财产的莫大损失。因此，清除水雷工作成为苏联和平建设事业中的重要项目之一。影片《蔚蓝色的道路》（注）描写红海军在敖德萨港口水雷区域进行扫雷工作。它成功地刻划了苏维埃人民的高尚道德和英勇行为；他们在和平建设时期，和在战争时期一样，在斗争中、工作中发挥着高度的积极性和创造性；他们具备着克服一切困难的坚强意志和爱国主义、乐观主义的精神。
    除了搜索水雷，加以爆炸外，海军方面还负有一个使命：要发现敌人制造新式水雷的秘密。这就需要冒着生命的危险去做分解水雷的工作，把它们的机件从外到里拆卸下来，加以研究。影片极力描写扫雷和分解水雷工作的困难和危险，因此就更鲜明地衬托出水雷手们的献身祖国的英雄主义。
    影片主角三级舰长拉他诺夫已被政府批准复员，可以恢复他在战前的商船船长职务。但他自愿为祖国更多地贡献他自己。当舰队找到了潜伏了三年的一个新式音响磁性水雷后，舰队里发生了两种意见：一种意见认为与其冒险分解，不如爆炸消灭它；另一种意见认为爆炸虽然重要，分解却更重要。因为不分解它，敌人的军事秘密将不能揭开。三级舰长坚持后一种意见，并勇敢地要求派他担任这项工作。他表示，如果遭到不幸，别人还可以继续他的工作，再去分解第二个、第三个……水雷。即使牺牲也是有代价的：人们可以吸收前人的经验，修正方法，继续工作，最后一定能获得胜利。影片告诉我们，他的意见完全是正确的。
    但我们的主角并不是一个勇而无谋的人物，他的勇敢是与智慧结合着的。影片作者借三级舰长的口告诉观众说：成功不能依靠侥幸，侥幸的成功并不算光荣。影片强调了他做分解工作时的刚毅大胆，同时也没有忽略他在事前的深思熟虑……他为计算埋藏水雷的地点经常失眠，有时一直工作到早晨四时。仅有忘我的不怕牺牲的精神是不够的，还需要辛勤的劳动和不倦的钻研。
    影片从头到尾描写斗争任务的惊险，同时也处处穿插着三级舰长拉他诺夫和他妻子的爱情，他们家庭生活的幸福。从这种个人幸福与集体幸福的矛盾的统一的描写中，使观众认识了苏联人如何准确对待个人与革命利益的关系问题，表现出苏维埃时代的最先进人民的优美的品质，他们把人民的利益、国家的利益放在高于一切的地位，使个人的幸福服从于集体的幸福。而所谓个人幸福，也是那样不可分离地交织在集体之中。三级舰长在冒着生命危险，完成任务之后，对他妻子说：“只有现在我才感到自己的可爱……”（大意）接着又说，他下一次将更进一步地改进工作——“下次我将剪断红色电线……”（大意）——妻子回答他：“你是永远不会满足自己的……”影片在这些地方，充分表现了苏维埃人的丰富的精神生活的各方面。
    影片细致地刻划了娜加的内心矛盾。舰长和他妻子的思想情绪并不是经常完全一致的。当然，他们都是新的人，娜加也是具有革命的人生观的人。但由于舰长所受的锻炼更多，因此有了一些轩轾。影片上出现的娜加时时在忧虑丈夫的安全，甚至有时候不很满意他的工作。但她总是克制自己的弱点，不断提高自己。
    例如影片描写娜加在学校里上课，小学生提到水雷的可怕，她听到楼下卡车的隆隆声音，勾起了她的心事，不觉失态。但又立刻振作起来，批评学生的话不正确。在一次散步中，娜加向丈夫提到旁人们都能有和平幸福的生活，她却还要担惊受怕，像生活在“战时”一样。拉他诺夫再一次地鼓励她。有一次，她甚至想像：会有一天，丈夫真的一去不返。她在家里等待，突然听到敲门声，进来的是一个报告噩耗的水手，“他向我慢慢地脱下帽子。……”这时影片中明显地描画出娜加的惊惧悲痛的神情。但丈夫的沉着的声音重复克服了娜加的恐惧心理。他说，“要大胆！要勇敢！只要勇敢困难就不存在！”三级舰长给观众的印象也不单独是英勇无畏这一方面，他是十分理解，体贴和爱他的妻子的。但他坚持战斗，毫不动摇，他的坚强的意志，对祖国的无限忠诚，影响了他的妻子，使她一次一次地坚强起来。……透过这些有矛盾，有斗争，有波折的生活和心理的刻划，我们从电影上所认识的人物就显得是全面的，整个的，真实可信的，而不是片面的，生硬的，干瘪的。作者深刻地发掘了，表现人物的内心的起伏明暗的各个侧面，和发展阶段。这种创作方法既不是脱离了生活实际，单纯地根据政治概念来凭空制造人物、情节；也不等于无选择地堆砌细节。而是把现实生活更集中，更提炼地反映出来，使作品的主题思想既有深刻的教育意义，又有很大的说服力。
    三级舰长分解水雷这一场戏，是影片的最高潮。这一场戏处理得十分生动。观众和银幕上的观察分解水雷工作的委员会的人们，同样屏住呼吸，注视着远方的一个沉默的帐幕。帐幕中挂着水雷，拉他诺夫和他的助手正在一颗螺丝又一颗螺丝地拆卸。帐幕内汗流浃背的紧张状况帐幕外是看不见的。远远地只见风吹幕布，有一片布角微微飘动，显得沉默而不可测。用事物的外表和内部的不同，来造成强烈的对比，这手法是相当巧妙的。委员会的人们一眼不眨盯住这神秘的帐幕，连点燃香烟都没有转移目光；以及银幕上映出的桌上陆续增加的一颗颗螺丝钉；和表面的指针从早晨一直移动到下午……这寥寥几个镜头，强烈地抓住了观众的注意力，也因此充分表现了作品的思想内容。
    苏联人民相互间的真挚的爱，特别是上下级之间，在这一场戏中也充分反映出来。在开会讨论分解水雷时，那深深地爱着自己部下的一级舰长，经过长久的低头思索后，才最后批准了三级舰长的建议，站起来庄严地面对着他吐出“执行吧！”三个字。在执行任务时，三级舰长和他的助手上士的亲切和严肃的关系，更被刻划得动人。舰长要剪断水雷内部的电线，不知道该先剪那一根。他知道这一剪子下去，可能立刻引起爆炸，于是想调开他身边的助手。那一段对白的大意是：
    “上士同志，请你离开得远些，我要剪这根电线。”
    “不，三级舰长同志，我是水雷手，这工作让我来做，这是我的任务。”
    “上士同志，我也是水雷手，这也是我的任务。”
    最后，三级舰长用命令来教他离开工作地点，上士才不得不出去。可是他始终不放心，不肯走远，还是逗留在舰长工作的帐幕外面，守候着，保护着他的上级，以防万一。果真，这根电线一剪断，水雷立刻爆炸，拉他诺夫被轰倒。上十不顾危险，冲进帐幕抱起舰长飞奔出外，才把他救出了危险。
    在这之前，当上士守候在帐幕附近时，另一个助手也来到，上士知道情势的危险，立刻让他跑开，就像舰长支使他自己跑开一样。这种上下级之间的关系，相互的爱和坚持原则性的结合，是很动人的。这爱的纽带把苏联人民团结成一个坚强的集体。这样的集体，这样的人民，怎么能不胜利！
    导演曾用一个静止的镜头摄出帐幕中上士的一个侧面像，他的脸部的紧张的肌肉，突出的颚骨，全神贯注地看着舰长的动作的睁大的眼睛……这幅肖像画是美丽的。这虽不是什么独创的手法，但在这里运用得很恰当。记得《大转变》中也有相似的特写镜头。那口中衔着电话线，死在火线上的汽车司机的头像，也在银幕上停留了好几秒钟，给观众以思索回旋的余地，得到一个不易磨灭的印象。电影镜头一般都是连续不断的动作的急速变化，偶然插入一个完全静止的像雕刻似的人物特写的镜头，这种表现方法是美妙的，对主题思想的表现有一定的帮助作用。
    《蔚蓝色的道路》虽不是记叙一大战役，一大历史事件的巨构，它的规模较小，但它具有深刻的思想内容和积极的教育意义，又充满着生活气息和抒情成份。它不失为一件精致的艺术品。
