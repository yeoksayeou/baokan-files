Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th. The directly subordinate units of the CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau began a rectification movement in early August. Since the July 1st rectification mobilization report made by Rao Shushi, Secretary of the CCP Central Committee's East China Bureau, at a meeting of Party member cadres, each directly subordinate unit has formulated specific rectification plans based on the CCP Central Committee and East China Bureau's rectification instructions and according to the characteristics of each department. Currently, the main focus is on studying documents, preparing and deliberating on inspection work, and rectification meetings for leading cadres will be held separately.

The East China Bureau's Directly Subordinate Units Rectification General Study Committee has been established, with Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau, and Shu Tong, Minister of the Propaganda Department, serving as Chairman and Vice Chairman respectively. It has six rectification study committees under its jurisdiction, and branch organizations are established for each major work department according to the original Party committee system. Responsible cadres at all levels participate in the leadership. At the second meeting of the Rectification General Study Committee, Secretary Rao Shushi gave a brief analysis and review of the main problems in the East China Bureau's leadership work over the past year. The heads of other major departments will also successively conduct work reviews at the meeting.

The East China Bureau's directly subordinate units' rectification plan pointed out that the focus of this rectification is to closely link with the current work tasks, and through summarizing the various tasks since coming south, to examine the ideology and work style of cadres at all levels, overcome the bureaucratic leadership and the commandism of subordinates in carrying out tasks, as well as the serious phenomena of disorganization and indiscipline. In some departments and cadres, especially among veteran cadres, attention should also be paid to overcoming the erroneous ideas of individual heroism, such as pride and complacency in considering themselves meritorious, and hedonistic corruption. In united front work, attention should be paid to strengthening the concept of unity and cooperation with non-Party masses, and overcoming various forms of closed-doorism or accommodationist erroneous tendencies. The purpose of the rectification is to improve work style, strengthen unity, and improve leadership. The steps of this rectification are generally from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadre Party members to general Party members, and from leading cadres to general cadres. Work inspections should focus on Party member cadres. For new cadres, the main focus is to strengthen education in revolutionary ideology and mass viewpoints. In inspection work, it is required to combine top-down and inside-outside the Party, and to link the main shortcomings in each person's ideological work style with the review of inspection work.

The rectification time for the directly subordinate organs of the East China Bureau is scheduled for three months, ending at the end of October.

　　中共中央华东局直属单位
    将总结南下以来工作  检查干部思想和作风
    【新华社上海十四日电】中共中央华东局各直属单位，已于八月初开始整风。自七月一日中共中央华东局书记饶漱石在党员干部大会上作了整风动员报告后，各直属单位即根据中共中央及华东局整风指示，并按照各部门特点，订出了具体的整风计划。目前主要是学习文件，准备和酝酿检查工作，并将分别召开领导干部的整风会议。
    华东局直属单位整风总学习委员会业已成立，由华东局书记饶漱石、宣传部部长舒同分任正副主任委员。下辖六个整风学习委员会，并按原来党委系统，每一主要工作部门成立分会组织。各级负责干部，都参加领导。在整风总学习委员会第二次会议上，饶漱石书记曾就华东局一年来在领导工作中的主要问题，作了扼要的分析和检讨。其他各主要部门的负责人，亦将陆续在该会中进行工作检讨。
    华东局直属单位的整风计划指出，这次整风的重点是密切联系当前的工作任务，通过总结南下以来的各项工作，检查各级干部的思想和作风，克服领导上的官僚主义和下级执行任务中的命令主义，以及无组织无纪律的严重现象。在某些部门和干部中，特别是老干部中，应同时注意克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪，和享乐腐化等个人主义的错误思想。在统一战线工作中，则应注意加强与非党群众团结合作的观念，克服各种不同形式的关门主义或迁就主义的错误倾向。而整风的目的则是改进作风、加强团结和提高领导。这次整风的步骤，一般是由党内到党外，由干部党员到一般党员，由领导干部到一般干部。工作检查应着重党员干部。对于新干部，主要是加强革命思想和群众观点的教育。在检查工作中要求做到上下结合、党内外结合、并从检查工作中联系检讨各人思想作风上的主要缺点。
    华东局直属机关整风时间，预定三个月，至十月底结束。
