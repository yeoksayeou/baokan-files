    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科二十一日讯：苏联部长会议顷发布关于在伏尔加河畔建设古比雪夫水力发电站的决定。
    决定指出：在伏尔加河畔建设水力发电站，对于确保莫斯科、古比雪夫、萨拉多夫各工业企业的电力供应，铁道的电气化，外伏尔加区的土地灌溉，以及伏尔加河上航运的改进，均具有极大的重要性。因此，苏联部长会议特决定自一九五○年开始兴工建造。新的发电站将具有发电能力约二百万千瓦，在水位正常的年份的发电量将为一百亿千瓦时。为了执行一切建设事宜，苏联政府决定成立“古比雪夫水力发电站建设处”，并责成电力站部拟具架设高压电线及发展动力系统的计划；责成发电站设计局处理与建设有关的设计、调查和研究工作，以确保该发电站的建设工程在一九五五年完成和发电。
    苏联部长会议为了促进伏尔加河沿岸铁道的电气化，决定沿伏尔加河的水闸，为铁道干线增辟一条线路，并责成铁道部制订铁道接轨的计划。
    决定指出：利用古比雪夫水力发电站的电力，将使外伏尔加区一百万公顷的土地有水灌溉。因此，苏联部长会议责成农业部拟订利用电力实行灌溉的计划。
