　　Decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on Awarding Inventions, Technical Improvements, and Rationalization Proposals Related to Production
    (Adopted at the 45th Government Administration Council Meeting on August 11, 1950)

    In order to promote the restoration and development of production, it is necessary to encourage the enthusiasm and creativity of workers, technicians, staff, and all those engaged in scientific and technological research related to production, so that they can fully utilize their knowledge, experience, and wisdom to devote themselves to inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals. This is of paramount importance to the cause of national economic construction. In the past, employees of various enterprises have made many inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production, but some competent authorities have failed to give due attention to this important work or have failed to provide reasonable rewards and remuneration, which has resulted in the failure to adequately encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, technicians, staff, and all those engaged in scientific and technological research for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals. This is undoubtedly a loss to the cause of national economic construction. In order to encourage inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals in an organized and guided manner, and to protect the rights and interests of inventors, technical improvers, and rationalization proposers, the following decisions are made:

    (1) The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council shall be responsible for the unified management of all matters related to inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production nationwide, and shall carry out the following tasks:

    A. Guide all economic departments in conducting research, experimentation, and promotion of inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production;

    B. Review and evaluate various inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production;

    C. Approve invention rights or patent rights, and issue invention certificates, patent certificates, bonuses, certificates of merit, and other various rewards.

    (2) All economic departments shall designate specific personnel or appropriate administrative bodies to guide their subordinate enterprises to fully encourage and assist in inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production, and shall be responsible for organizing research and experimentation on inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals that are of great significance and have the possibility of being realized; those that are successfully tested shall be responsible for promoting them and reporting them to higher authorities.

    (3) Responsible persons of larger state-owned enterprises shall designate appropriate specialized institutions within their enterprises to perform the following tasks:

    A. Review the plans of workers, technicians, and staff in the enterprise for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals, help them formulate experimental plans, provide them with convenience for experimentation, and guide their experiments; those that cannot be experimented with in the enterprise shall be reported to the higher competent authorities;

    B. The daily wage paid to researchers engaged in research on inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals during the period of research and experimentation shall not be lower than their average daily wage earned during the past three months;

    C. Formulate specific implementation measures for inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals that have been successfully tested, be responsible for their promotion, and report inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals of great significance to higher authorities;

    D. Determine the rewards for each invention, technical improvement, and rationalization proposal that has been adopted, and submit them to the responsible person for approval and issuance; those that have been reported to higher authorities shall have their rewards determined by the higher authorities.

    (4) Managers or factory directors of larger private enterprises shall be responsible for guiding workers, technicians, and staff in their enterprises to engage in research on inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals, and provide them with convenience for research and experimentation; ensure that timely and reasonable rewards are given for adopted inventions, improvements, and suggestions; inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals of great significance shall be reported to the central competent authorities for rewards.

    (5) When the work of encouragement and assistance is actively carried out, attention must be paid to preventing a bias, that is, rashly engaging in trial production without careful research and due experimentation, resulting in the waste of state property.

    (6) The research expenses, experimental expenses, and bonuses required for the implementation of this decision and which should be paid by the state shall be allowed to be included in the budget or paid from the reserve fund.

    (7) The Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council shall formulate provisional regulations on rewarding inventions, technical improvements, and rationalization proposals related to production, and provisional regulations on protecting invention rights and patent rights, and submit them to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation.

    (8) For scientific inventions, medical method inventions, and copyright protection that are not directly related to production, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council shall formulate separate measures and regulations and submit them to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation.

　　中央人民政府政务院关于奖励有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的决定
    （一九五零年八月十一日政务院第四十五次政务会议通过）
    为了促进生产事业之恢复与发展，必须鼓励工人、技术人员和职员以及一切从事有关生产的科学与技术研究工作者的积极性与创造性，使能充分发挥其知识、经验与智慧，致力于发明、技术改进及合理化建议的工作，这对国家经济建设事业有头等重大的意义。过去各种企业的职工曾经作过许多有关生产的发明、技术改进和合理化建议，但有些主管机关对此项重大工作未能予以应有的注意，或未给以合理的奖励和报酬，致使广大工人、技术人员、职员以及一切从事科学技术研究工作者对发明、技术改进及合理化建议的积极性没有得到应有的鼓励，这无疑是国家经济建设事业的损失。为了有组织有领导地鼓励发明、技术改进及合理化建议，并保障发明者、改进技术者和合理化建议者的权益，特作下列决定：
    （一）由政务院财政经济委员会统一管理全国有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议事宜，并进行下列各项工作：
    甲、指导各经济部门进行有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议之研究、实验及推广工作；
    乙、审查、鉴定各种有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议；
    丙、核定发明权或专利权，并发给发明证书、专利证书、奖金、奖状及其他各种奖励。
    （二）各经济部门均应指定专人或适当的行政机构指导所属企业充分鼓励协助有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议事宜，并负责对于意义重大且有实现可能的发明、技术改进及合理化建议，组织研究与实验；对实验成功者负责推广，并报告上级。
    （三）规模较大的公营企业主管人应指定本企业适当的专门机构执行下列任务：
    甲、审查本企业中工人、技术人员和职员之发明、技术改进及合理化建议的计划，帮助其制定实验计划，给以实验的便利，并指导其实验；在本企业中无法实验者，应报告上级主管机关；
    乙、对从事于发明、技术改进与合理化建议之研究工作者，在进行研究与实验期间所发给的每日工资，不得低于其过去三个月间所得每日平均工资；
    丙、对实验成功之发明、技术改进和合理化建议，制定具体推行办法负责推行，并将有重大意义之发明、技术改进和合理化建议报告上级；
    丁、核定对已采用之每件发明、技术改进和合理化建议之奖励，提请主管人批准发给之；已报告上级机关者，其奖励由上级机关决定之。
    （四）规模较大的私营企业之经理或厂长应负责指导本企业中工人、技术人员、职员从事于发明、技术改进和合理化建议的研究，并予以研究、实验的便利；保证对于已采用的发明、改进及建议给予及时的、合理的奖励；其有重大意义的发明、技术改进和合理化建议，应报请中央主管机关奖励之。
    （五）在鼓励、协助工作积极展开的时候，须注意防止一种偏向，即不经过仔细的研究和应有的实验过程而贸然从事试制，以致浪费国家的财物。
    （六）执行本决定所需并应由国家支付的研究费、实验费及奖金，准予编列预算或在预备费内开支。
    （七）由政务院财政经济委员会拟定有关生产的发明、技术改进及合理化建议的奖励暂行条例及保障发明权与专利权暂行条例，提交政务院批准公布实行。
    （八）对于与生产无直接关系的科学发明、医疗方法的发明，以及著作权的保障，由政务院文化教育委员会另拟办法、条例，提交政务院批准公布实行。
