　　The Over-Quota Bonus Work of Beijing Automobile Repair Factory
　　Zhou Linwen
　　Since the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory launched a production competition last October, labor efficiency has improved, breaking through the original quotas and plans, and costs have been significantly reduced. In order to consolidate the enthusiasm of employees and further improve production, the factory formulated quotas and implemented over-quota bonuses from December of last year, based on production figures before December. In the past six months, production efficiency has increased month by month, and the number of groups exceeding quotas has gradually increased. For example, among the twelve groups of car repair workers, four groups exceeded quotas in January of this year, and eight groups exceeded quotas in March, exceeding the total car repair task by 252.7 points (the point system is described in the bonus method below); in May, eight groups exceeded quotas, exceeding the total car repair task by 138.6 points. The same situation occurred in parts manufacturing. In the first month, although some people could not reach the quota, after the workers' efforts, almost everyone could exceed the quota by January. For example, the production of car fan belts, with the quota set at 100, reached 107 in January, 149 in March, and 132 in May. After the implementation of over-quota bonuses, not only did output increase, but production costs also decreased accordingly. For example, the actual cost of the "T-214" fan belt in March was 4.72 percent lower than the planned cost, and in April it was 11.2 percent lower. With the increase in production, workers' incomes also increased. In January, the number of prize-winners accounted for 51 percent of the total number of employees, with prize money of 2,717.38 jin of millet; in March, the number of prize-winners was 63 percent, with prize money of 5,978.85 jin of millet; in April, the number of prize-winners was 54.7 percent, with prize money of 7,840.64 jin of millet. The factory is currently revising the unreasonable parts of the over-quota bonus system in order to push factory production further forward.
        Bonus Method
　　The factory has formulated four types of bonus methods according to the nature of the work.
　　Individual Over-Quota Bonus: Applicable to lathe operators who manufacture parts in batches. Different output quotas are set according to the different conditions of the lathes, and those who exceed the quota receive a bonus. The tool sample room and wood mold group use estimated work instead of quotas because the work is piecemeal.
　　Collective Over-Quota Bonus: Applicable to situations where a production team or several people must jointly complete batch products, and a unit output quota is set. Such as foundry workers, forging workers, rubber workers, etc. At the end of the month, democratic evaluation is carried out to distribute bonuses.
　　Fixed-Point Over-Quota Bonus: Applicable to car repair work (such as washing engines, tightening tiles, etc.). The various car repair tasks are assigned points based on the general labor time required (each point represents the amount of general labor work for six hours). And stipulates that each person's monthly quota is 35 points (208 working hours). Each group consists of three, four, or five people. Work is recorded at ordinary times, and calculated at the end of the month, and those who exceed the quota receive a bonus.
　　“Weighted Average” Bonus: Mainly refers to indirect production workers, such as motor repair workers, power workers, machine tool maintenance workers, etc. The percentage is determined according to the relationship between each type of worker and the direct production department, and then the bonus is received by weighted average according to the bonus of each job.
　　The source of the bonus is paid from a proportion of the wages saved due to exceeding the quota.
  Several Issues Worth Noting
　　Currently, the factory still has the following issues worth noting in the over-quota bonus work.
　　First, bonuses should be combined with the production plan. In this regard, there are three situations worth improving. First of all, because the car repair workers in the factory calculate bonuses according to the fixed-point method, they tend to only strive to do more work, while ignoring the production plan. As a result, a lot of semi-finished products (vehicles) are produced, but the overall production plan is not completed. The way to overcome this is to strengthen administrative management, emphasize that over-quota bonuses must be carried out under the premise of completing the production plan, and mobilize workers to discuss guaranteeing the completion of the plan. At the same time, the bonus method itself should also stipulate preventive measures, for example, those who fail to complete the plan should have their bonus deducted. Secondly, it is necessary to prevent neglecting quality. Since there are no explicit regulations on the quality specifications of car repair work, a recent in-depth inspection revealed some quality defects. An effective way to prevent this deviation is to establish a strict inspection responsibility system. Again, it is necessary to educate workers to pay close attention to the protection of machinery and equipment in production.
　　Second, in the initial implementation of the over-quota bonus system, most workers strive for over-quota bonuses from the perspective of labor intensity. This is limited. Therefore, at present, attention should be paid to improving technology, increasing output from improving machine tools, and striving for more over-quota bonuses.
　　Third, bonus methods should be flexibly used according to the specific conditions of each workshop. Over-quota bonuses should not necessarily be aimed at increasing output. The characteristic of the aluminum casting room in the factory is that there are many defective products. If the over-quota bonus method is adopted, there are very few opportunities to win prizes. The more workers want to win prizes, the more anxious they become, and the more defective products there are. It is more appropriate to set a bonus method for reducing defective products for the aluminum casting room.
　　Fourth, because the auxiliary workers implement the weighted average bonus method, they also get a share of the bonus when other direct production workers win prizes. In this way, the over-quota method loses its effect of stimulating production for them. Therefore, it is also appropriate to formulate bonus methods based on their specific work achievements (such as power workers protecting generators and saving fuel, water tower workers saving water consumption, etc.).
　　Fifth, unreasonable parts of the bonus method should be revised in a timely manner, which is an important issue in the trial implementation of over-quota bonuses. Judging from the current factory management situation, the phenomenon of unbalanced quotas is inevitable. For example, apprentice Zhang Jinghan is doing the third step of sleeve work. Because this is a new job, the estimated work is inaccurate. As a result, it exceeds the quota by two or three times. In May, he won a prize of more than 400 jin of rice, which is higher than the wages of technicians. Many workers are dissatisfied. Therefore, when implementing over-quota bonuses on a trial basis, the trial period of the quota should not be too long. In this way, on the one hand, the above-mentioned deviations can be avoided. At the same time, after workers' efforts, after a stage, it is generally easy to exceed the quota. If the quota is not revised in time at this time, it will lose its stimulating effect on production.
　　In addition, attention should also be paid to educating employees, especially political reward work should be strengthened when implementing over-quota bonuses. Avoiding a purely economic point of view is also very important.

　　北京汽车修配厂的超额奖励工作
    周林文
    北京汽车修配厂自去年十月开展生产竞赛之后，劳动效率提高，突破了原有的定额和计划，成本显著降低。该厂为了巩固职工的劳动热情，进一步提高生产，于去年十二月起按照十二月以前的生产数字，制订定额，实行超额奖励。半年以来，生产效率逐月提高，超额的组数也逐渐增加。如修车工人共十二个组，在今年一月份有四个组超额，三月份则有八个组超额，超过修车总任务二百五十二点七分（分的制订，见本文奖励办法）；五月份八个组超额，超过修车总任务一百三十八点六分。在配件制造方面也出现了同样的情况。最初一个月，虽有些人还不能达到，但经工人努力后，到一月份就差不多全可以超额。如制造汽车零件风扇带，以定额为一百计，一月份达到一百零七，三月份达到一百四十九，五月份达到一百三十二。实行超额奖励后，不但产量提高，生产成本也随着降低。如“Ｔ—二一四”风扇带在三月份实际成本较计划成本降低百分之四点七二，四月份降低百分之十一点二。随着生产的提高，工人收入也增加了。一月份得奖人数占全厂总人数的百分之五十一，得奖金小米二千七百一十七点三八斤；三月份得奖人数为百分之六十三，得奖金小米五千九百七十八点八五斤；四月份得奖人数为百分之五十四点七，奖金小米为七千八百四十点六四斤。现该厂正在进行修正超额奖励制度中的不合理部分，以便将工厂生产更推向前进。
        奖励办法
    该厂依工作性质，制订了四种奖励办法。
    个人超额奖：适用于成批制造零件的车工。根据车床的不同条件，定出不同的产量定额，超过的就得奖。工具样板间和木模组因是零活，以估工代替定额。
    集体超额奖：适用于必须以一个生产小组或是几个人共同完成成批产品的情况，订出单位的产量定额。如铸工、锻工、橡胶工等。月终民主评议，分配奖金。
    定分超额奖：适用修车工作（如洗引擎、紧瓦等）。将各种修车工作根据一般需要劳动时间定出分（每分为六个小时一般劳动工作的数量）。并规定每人每月的定额为三十五分（二百零八个工时）。每小组三、四、五人不等。平时工作记载，月终计算，超过者得奖。
    “加权平均”奖：主要是指间接生产工人，如电机修理工、动力工、机具保养工等。视每种工人与直接生产部门的关系定出百分率，再按各工作间的奖金，加权平均，领受奖金。
    奖金的来源是从因超额而节省出来的工资中按比例抽出一部来支付。
  几个值得注意的问题
    目前该厂在超额奖励工作中，尚有如下几个问题值得注意。
    一、奖金应与生产计划结合。对此，有三种情况值得改进。首先是，该厂修车工因为是按定分法来计算奖金，就发生只争取多作活，而忽视生产计划的现象。结果半成品（车辆）生产很多，而总的生产计划未完成。克服的办法，一方面行政应加强管理，强调超额奖励一定要在完成生产计划的前提下进行，并发动工人讨论计划保证完成外，同时，奖励办法本身也应规定防止办法，譬如，完不成计划的，应扣除其奖金。其次是，必须防止忽视质量。修车工作的质量规格因无明文规定，最近深入检查时，发现有质量较差的现象。防止这一偏向的有效办法，是建立严格的检验责任制。再次是必须教育工人，在生产中切实注意保护机器设备。
    二、初期实行超额奖励制度中，一般工友多从劳动强度方面努力，争取超额奖。这是有限度的。因此，目前应注意提高技术，从改良机具方面来增加产量，争取更多的超额奖金。
    三、应根据各车间的具体情况，灵活运用奖励办法。不一定都是以提高产量为目标地进行超额奖励。该厂铸铝间，特点是废品多。如按超额奖励的办法，得奖机会很少。工友愈想得奖愈急躁，而废品也愈多。对铸铝间，订出减少废品得奖办法则更为合适。
    四、辅助工因是实行加权平均奖励办法，其他直接生产工人得奖，他们也有份，这样，超额办法对他们失去了刺激生产的作用。因此，也宜根据他们的具体工作成绩（如动力工对保护发电机、节省燃料，水塔工节省水耗等）来制订奖励办法。
    五、应及时修正奖励办法中的不合理部分，这在试行超额奖励中是一个重要问题。就目前工厂管理情况，定额不平衡的现象难免发生。如学徒张景汉作套管第三步工作，因为这是一新的工作，估工不准，结果超出定额两三倍，五月份得奖金米四百余斤，比技工的工资还高。很多工人都不满意。因此，试行超额奖励时，定额试用时间不宜太长，这样，一方面可以避免上述偏向，同时，工人经过努力，经过一个阶段，一般都容易超过定额，此时如不及时改订定额，将对生产失去刺激作用。
    此外，在实行超额奖励时也应注意教育职工尤其是政治奖励工作更应加强。避免产生单纯经济观点，也是很重要的。
