　　Anshan Iron and Steel Company Ironmaking Plant
    Unite and Transform Technical Personnel
    [This newspaper's Anshan dispatch] The Anshan Iron and Steel Company Ironmaking Plant unites and educates technical personnel through mass activities and production campaigns. In the past, the plant focused solely on mobilizing workers and did not pay attention to uniting and educating technical personnel. For example, some technical personnel who wanted to join the trade union could not find an introducer, and some technical personnel who joined the trade union did not know who to pay their membership dues to. Since the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly pointed out the need to strengthen the unity of technical personnel in October of last year, the plant leadership has reviewed past shortcomings and adopted the following methods to unite and transform technical personnel, achieving significant results: (1) Absorb technical personnel to participate in various mass activities. For example, the plant convened symposiums for outstanding producers and also absorbed technical personnel to participate. After listening to the exemplary deeds of many party members, the technical personnel told others, "After participating in this meeting, we understood how to specifically serve the people." In the movement to create new records, as well as in signing liaison contracts and formulating production quotas, technical personnel were mobilized to actively participate, enabling them to further delve into their professional work. As a result, technical personnel continuously created three or four new records in terms of output. In the past, under the puppet Manchukuo regime, one-one-three steel (i.e., silicon and manganese each accounting for one percent, and sulfur accounting for 0.03 percent) was never manufactured, but in May, the average content of silicon and manganese reached 1.05 percent each, and the sulfur content was 0.027 percent. Moreover, off-grade iron was basically eliminated (off-grade iron accounted for 0.29 percent of the total production in May). (2) Give technical personnel positions and authority, and combine this with the training of new technical personnel. In order to improve new technical personnel, the apprentice system was implemented. When the furnace was first started, the new technical personnel had no experience and did not know how to manage the furnace, so engineers took turns on duty, and the new technical personnel observed. After one or two months, the new technicians were allowed to work on duty, with direct guidance from the engineers, gradually improving the operational capabilities of the new technical personnel, and directly increasing the enthusiasm of the technical personnel. For example, Wang Hai'en said, "The leadership can boldly entrust us with work, so we want to do the work well. When the work is done well, we also learn experience, which is the greatest help to us." (3) Hold regular technical symposiums. Because the things technical personnel learned in the past were different, their understanding of technical issues was not uniform. Through technical symposiums, they can learn from each other and exchange experiences; at the same time, production quotas can be discussed by technical personnel to reach a unified understanding. Since the establishment of this system, the phenomenon of unstable furnace conditions has been basically resolved, and the quality has also been improved. (4) Establish a summary report system. In the first quarter, technical personnel who worked better were designated to write end-of-month summaries. It was found that he could not only summarize experience, but also correct work shortcomings, so this experience was promoted in the second quarter. (5) Carry out criticism and self-criticism. On May 9, an operational technician left his post during duty hours and went home, and he could not be found when an accident occurred. The workers then criticized him in the criticism and commendation book. The administrative负责人 of the factory instructed: "We should learn from the workers' enthusiasm for labor." The technicians also felt that the criticism was very correct and was of great help to them.

　　鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂
    团结改造技术人员
    【本报鞍山讯】鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂通过群众活动和生产运动，团结教育技术人员。该厂过去单纯发动工人，没有注意团结教育技术人员，如有些技术人员想入工会找不着介绍人，有个别技术人员加入工会后，不知会费交给谁。自去年十月中共鞍山市委明确指出加强团结技术人员后，该厂领导上检讨了过去缺点，采取下面各种方法来团结改造技术人员，获得显著的效果：（一）吸收技术人员参加各种群众活动。如该厂召集优秀生产者座谈会，也吸收技术人员参加。技术人员听了许多党员的模范事迹以后，告诉别人说：“参加了这个会议，我们懂得怎样具体的为人民服务了。”在创造新纪录运动，以及订立联系合同，制订生产定额等运动中，发动技术人员积极参加，使他们更加钻研业务。因而在产量上技术人员一连创造了三、四次新纪录。伪满时没有制造过一、一、三制钢铁（即矽锰各占百分之一，硫占百分之○·○三），五月份则平均达到含矽及含锰量各占百分之一·○五，含硫百分之○·○二七了。而且基本上消灭了号外铁（五月份号外铁占生产总数百分之○·二九）。（二）使技术人员有职有权，并与培养新技术人员结合。为提高新技术人员，实行带徒弟方式。刚开炉时，新技术人员没经验，不会管理炉子，就由工程师轮流值班，新技术人员见习。经一、二月后，让新技术员值班，由工程师直接指导，逐步提高新技术人员操作能力，也直接提高了技术人员的积极性。如王海恩说：“上级能大胆交给我们工作，我们就想把工作搞好。工作搞好了，经验也学到了，对我们帮助最大。”（三）定期召开技术座谈会。由于技术人员过去所学的东西不同，对技术问题的认识也不统一。通过技术座谈会，可以互相学习，交流经验；同时还使生产定额通过技术人员的讨论，求得统一认识。自建立这制度后，基本上解决了炉子情况不稳定的现象，并且还提高了质量。（四）建立总结报告制度。第一季度中，曾指定工作较好的技术员写月终总结。发现他不但能总结经验，而且能改正工作缺点，第二季度便推广了这一经验。（五）开展批评和自我批评。五月九日运转技术员在值班时间离职回家，发生事故找不到他。工人便在批评表扬簿上批评他。工厂行政负责人则指示：“应向工人学习劳动热情。”技术员也觉得批评得很对，对他们帮助很大。
