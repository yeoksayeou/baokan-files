　　Anci County Leaders Learn from the Lessons of the Nanhan Breach
    Deepen Inspection of Bureaucratism and Strengthen Flood Control Work
    [This News Report] After the breach in the Longhe South Embankment (i.e., the North Protection Road Embankment) in the Yongding River flood area of Anci County, Hebei Province, at Nanhan Village, the County People's Government and the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have conducted a profound self-criticism. The original text briefly states:
    On July 29th, the People's Daily published the news of the Nanhan breach, along with a short commentary. We completely accept the criticism. The lessons of the Nanhan breach are extremely painful.
    First, the construction of the Longhe South Embankment (i.e., the North Protection Road Embankment) this spring was originally intended to prevent the Yongding River from flooding northward, especially to protect the Beijing-Tianjin Railway from being destroyed by floods. We did not sufficiently recognize the significance of this. We believed that the river had not flooded north in the past two years and that the railway was relatively safe. With the embankment built this year, we would be absolutely insured. Furthermore, the river channel shifted south this spring, making us even more blindly optimistic. Even after the first flood on July 1st, when the Anlang Highway breached, and the floodwaters directly threatened the eastern section of the protection embankment, especially the 2,500-meter dangerous section of the East Zhangjiawu section, where the water was only 8.7 centimeters from the top of the embankment, and the embankment was already very strained, we still did not pay attention. We still did not strictly defend the entire embankment line. Instead, regarding the 25-li western section of the embankment, we felt that since the two previous floods had not reached it, even if this one came, it would only flow eastward along the embankment. Under the control of such a series of blindly optimistic and paralyzing thoughts, we only generally held two flood control meetings. The county leadership did not organize forces to inspect, and therefore, until the Nanhan breach, we were still not clear about the condition of the piles, materials, and flood protection supplies on the western section of the embankment, how many rescue teams there were. This serious bureaucratism of ours is the main root cause of the Nanhan breach.
    Second, we only focused on protecting key dangerous points downstream and neglected to grasp the entire line and failed to conduct a comprehensive inspection. As a result, in the 25-li embankment section of the Second District, only five flood protection stations were set up, and no piles or other materials were available. It was not until the Nanhan breach on July 20th that we learned that the rescue teams organized in the villages of the Second District after the 15th and the rescue teams of the Jiuzhou section of the Eighth District had not been formed at all. The County Headquarters did not know that the Second District Flood Control Headquarters had moved west to Nanwangli Village south of the embankment. The reason why the troops and weapons directly fighting the water on the western section of the embankment were like this was also due to the serious bureaucratic ideology and work style of the County Government and the County Committee.
    Third, the connections between upstream and downstream, between districts, and between the junctions of embankment sections were very poor. We had no understanding of the overflow from the Lianggezhuang breach in Gu'an County. When we discovered it, there was no modern transportation to make contact. It took more than a hundred li to send a letter back and forth, and it was too late. The Nanhan breach occurred at the junction of the embankment sections of the Second and Eighth Districts. In the past, no connection was specified. When the danger occurred in the Nanhan section, no one was guarding the dangerous section. After the cadres of the Eighth District discovered it, they failed to contact the Second District directly, but went to the County Headquarters to report, a round trip of eighty li. In addition, in terms of technical guidance, we paid more attention to the embankment and neglected the embankment below; we also did not pay enough attention to the damage caused by water leakage. For example, when four laborers initially discovered the Nanhan breach, it was only a hole the size of a pot. Because there were neither materials nor experience, it expanded into a breach. The person in charge of the Nanhan breach section, Assistant Wang Fuyou, neither issued a second emergency mobilization order at that time nor patrolled the flood protection stations, neglecting his duties. This was certainly a lack of a responsible attitude towards the people. The erroneous incident of the Anlang Road breach caused by the dereliction of duty of cadres in the Seventh District on July 1st, and the failure to promptly investigate responsibility and the lack of clear rewards and punishments was also a reason for the Nanhan breach and the dereliction of duty of cadres. The Nanhan breach flooded and destroyed 20,000 mu of crops (the previous report from the Hebei Water Conservancy Bureau was nearly 10,000 mu), and seriously threatened the Beijing-Tianjin Road. Fortunately, the water receded sharply, and under the direct leadership of the higher authorities, the breach has been quickly closed. In order to quickly learn from this painful experience and ensure that such errors do not occur again, and to resolutely protect the North Protection Road Embankment, the County Government and the County Committee have re-strengthened the cadres of the County and District Flood Control Headquarters. The County Headquarters has also formed five inspection teams to conduct inspections of the embankment. The main county cadres have also gone to the western section to provide specific assistance. Telephones have been directly connected to the Xizhangjiawu of the Second District and the Dongzhangjiawu dangerous section of the First District to strengthen upstream and downstream connections. At the same time, cadres and laborers who contributed to the flood fighting and breach closure this time were rewarded, and individual derelict personnel were punished. A reward conference was held for flood control cadres, rescue teams, and personnel from flood protection stations in districts and villages, and flood control organizations were redeployed to strengthen the combat teams and weapons for fighting the water.

### 安次县领导干部接受南汉决口教训  深入检查官僚主义加强防汛工作

　　安次县领导干部接受南汉决口教训
    深入检查官僚主义加强防汛工作
    【本报讯】河北省安次县，永定河泛区龙河南堤在南汉村决口后，该县人民政府、中共县委会已作了深刻检讨。原文略称：
    七月二十九日，人民日报刊出了南汉决口的消息，同时发表了短评，我们完全接受批评。南汉决口的教训十分惨痛。
    第一、今春修筑龙河南堤（即北护路大堤），原为防止永定河水向北泛滥，特别是保护京津铁路免被洪水冲毁。我们对此种重大意义认识不够，认为前二年水并未北犯，铁路尚称安全，今年修了大堤，就绝对保险了。又加今春河道南移，就越发盲目乐观。即至七月一日第一次洪水来后，安廊公路决口，大水直接威胁东段护路堤，特别是东张家务段险工有二千五百公尺，水距堤顶仅八·七公寸，堤防已十分吃紧，但仍未引起我们的注意，仍未对全线堤段严加防守。而对西段堤长二十五华里，觉得两次洪水未到，这次即便来后也不过是顺堤东下。在这样一系列盲目乐观的麻痹思想支配下，只是一般的召开两次防汛会议，县领导上没有组织力量去检查，因而直至南汉决口，我们还不清楚西段堤防桩料、器材、汛铺准备如何？抢险队有多少？我们这种严重的官僚主义，是南汉决口的主要根源。
    第二、我们只着重在下游重点护险，忽视掌握全线和未做全面检查，因而在二区二十五里堤段，只设五个汛铺，且桩料等器材全无。直至七月二十日南汉决口，才知道二区是在十五日后到村去组织的抢险队和八区旧州段抢险队都根本未组成。二区防汛指挥部西迁堤南南王力村，县指挥部也不知道。西段堤防与水直接作战的部队和武器之所以如此，也是由于县府、县委的严重官僚主义思想作风。
    第三、上下游联系、区与区联系、堤段结合部与结合部联系等作的很差，对固安县梁各庄口门向外漫水，我们根本不了解。至发现时又无近代交通联系，步行送信往返百余里，为时已晚。南汉决口处是二、八区堤段结合部，过去未曾规定联系，南汉段险情发生没有人护险，八区干部发觉后未能直接到二区联系，而到县指挥部反映，往返八十里。另外在技术指导上，我们又多注意堤上而忽视了堤下；对水漏为害也重视不足，如南汉决口在四个民工初发觉时，仅一大小如壶的漏洞，因为既无器材又无经验，结果扩展成为决口。南汉决口段负责者——助理员王福友，当时既不下达二次紧急动员令，又不住汛铺巡逻，忽视职守，固属缺乏对人民负责的工作态度，而七月一日七区干部失职，安廊路决口的错误事件，未能及时追查责任，赏罚不明也是造成南汉决口、干部失职的一个原因。南汉决口，淹毁禾苗二万亩（河北水利局上次报导为近万亩）、严重威胁了京津路。幸水势骤落，在上级直接领导下，已迅速把决口堵闭。为迅速接受此次惨痛的经验教训，保证不再发生此种错误事件，并坚决保护北护路大堤，县府、县委又重新加强县、区防汛指挥部干部，县指挥部并组成了五个检查组，深入堤防进行检查，县主要干部亦到西段具体帮助；电话已直通二区西张家务和一区东张家务险工段，加强了上下联系。同时，并奖励了这次洪水抢险堵口有功的干部、民工，惩处了个别失职分子。召开了区村防汛干部、抢险队、汛铺等人员评奖大会，重又布署防汛组织，以便加强与水作战的战斗队伍和战斗武器。
