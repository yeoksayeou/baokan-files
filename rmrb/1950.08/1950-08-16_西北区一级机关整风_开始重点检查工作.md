　　[Report from the Masses Daily] The rectification movement in the first-level organs of the Northwest Region, after studying documents and exposing problems, has now begun to carry out key inspections and solve problems. Among the problems exposed, those with universality are: insufficient grasp of their own business and related policies and guidelines. The Civil Affairs Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee rarely studied issues related to political construction. For example, the central task of the department's Social Affairs Section was production and disaster relief, but it did not study or discuss the instructions of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Northwest Military and Political Committee on production and disaster relief. The Education Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee also did not properly study the policy on private schools and the education of ethnic minorities. As a result, after problems arose, they could not be resolved well. Some bureaus and offices under the leadership of the Taxation Bureau of the Finance Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, in their eagerness to complete tax collection tasks, imposed penalties arbitrarily. For example, in Xi'an, more than 800 households were fined for collecting the first quarter's business tax, and 1,384 bicycles and 19 rickshaws were fined for collecting license plate tax, which seriously affected tax policy. Another common problem is that the working relationships between departments are unreasonable and the procedures are complicated. This is particularly evident in financial departments. According to the plan of the Ministry of Water Resources, this year, the Shaanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau (directly led by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Northwest Military and Political Committee) will lend 1,000 waterwheels in the Guanzhong area for small-scale water conservancy, which will be directly supervised by the Water Administration Office of the Ministry of Water Resources. The Water Conservancy Bureau started preparing the plan on March 25, and it was not until July 9 that it signed a processing and ordering contract with the Xi'an Machinery Industry Association and started making waterwheels. During these three and a half months, it was busy with formalities, making plans, testing waterwheels, drafting articles, preparing budgets, asking for instructions back and forth, and negotiating with various agencies. The cumbersome nature of the official document system, such as the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, required more than 20 to 30 procedures for each official document, which was passed back and forth between the various ministries. Section chiefs, division chiefs, directors, ministers, full-time and part-time officials all had to review them, and as a result, it took two or three weeks to process an official document, which further delayed the work. In addition, the failure to understand the situation at the lower levels and the failure to conduct research and investigation are also common problems in various agencies. The Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee did not understand the situation of industry and commerce in various places, and even did not fully understand the situation of industry and commerce in Xi'an. The Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northwest Military and Political Committee did not understand the situation in various provinces when formulating the five-year cotton and grain plan, so it was impossible to start. The various agencies have thus identified the main problems as the focus of in-depth inspection work. For example, the focus of the inspection of the Financial and Economic Committee is the relationship between higher and lower levels and between various departments. At present, responsible cadres of some agencies have reported to all cadres on the focus of the inspection. Other agencies will make the same report in the near future. A comprehensive inspection will be launched soon.

### 西北区一级机关整风  开始重点检查工作

　　西北区一级机关整风  开始重点检查工作
    【本报讯】据群众日报消息：西北区一级机关的整风运动，经过学习文件，暴露问题，现已开始进行有重点的检查工作，解决问题。在暴露的问题中，带有普遍性的是：对本身的业务以及有关的政策、方针掌握不够。西北军政委员会民政部对建政方面的问题，是很少研究；如该部社会处的中心工作是生产救灾，但对中央人民政府政务院、内务部及西北军政委员会的生产救灾指示，就没有进行研究讨论。西北军政委员会教育部也未很好研究私立学校的方针问题，对少数民族的教育问题，因此问题发生后，就不能给以很好的解决。西北军政委员会财政部税务局所领导的某些局、所，为急于完成税收任务，便乱处罚，如西安市征收第一季度营业税，就罚了八百余户，征收使用牌照税，罚了自行车一千三百八十四辆，人力车十九辆，严重的影响了税收政策。另一个带有普遍性的问题，是各部门工作关系不合理，手续繁复。这在财经部门表现得比较突出。陕西省水利局（西北军政委员会水利部直接领导）的小型水利贷款，按照水利部的计划，本年度在关中地区贷放水车一千辆，由水利部水政处直接督导陕西省水利局执行。水利局自三月二十五日即着手编制计划，直到七月九日，才和西安机器业公会签订加工定货合同，开始制车。在这三个半月中，是忙于办手续，造计划，试水车，拟条文，编预算，来回请示，各机关交涉等等工作。公文制度等的繁杂，如水利部、农林部、民政部，每办一件公文要经过二十至三十道以上的手续，各部间转来转去，科长、处长、主任、部长，正职、副职、都要核阅，结果办理一件公文就需两三个星期的时间，就更延误了工作时间。另外，不了解下情，不善于调查研究，更是各机关普遍存在的问题。西北军政委员会劳动部不了解各地工商业的情况，甚至对西安工商业情况也不完全了解。西北军政委员会农林部在制定五年棉粮计划时，因为不了解各省情况，结果无从下手。各机关由此找出了主要的问题，作为深入检查工作的重点。如财政经济委员会的检查重点是上下级、各部门间的关系问题。目前，有些机关负责干部已经就检查的重点向全体干部作了报告。其他机关也将于最近作同样的报告。全面的检查工作即将迅速展开。
