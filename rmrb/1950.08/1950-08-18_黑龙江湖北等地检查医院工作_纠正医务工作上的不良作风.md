Heilongjiang, Hubei and Other Places Inspect Hospital Work
Correct Unhealthy Work Styles of Medical Staff
Leading cadres exhibit bureaucracy, failing to inspect work, rejecting criticism, and neglecting ideological leadership of medical staff.

[This Newspaper's News] Since liberation, under the correct leadership of the People's Government and with the efforts of the broad masses of medical workers, significant progress has been made in health and medical work in various regions. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work. Recently, local newspapers have published news and reader letters criticizing hospital work, exposing the bureaucratic attitudes of some hospital leaders and the irresponsible work styles of some medical staff. Some of these have attracted the attention of relevant leading organs and people's supervisory organs, and are being inspected and corrected. These hospitals include Heilongjiang Provincial Hospital, Wuhan Municipal First Hospital, Wuchang Hubei Provincial People's Hospital, hospitals directly under the Fujian Provincial Health Department, Beijing North China People's Hospital, and some hospitals in Tianjin. They are all relatively large in scale, have good technical equipment, and are under the direct leadership of senior health administrative organs. According to reports in various newspapers, serious bureaucracy is quite prevalent in the leadership of these hospitals. First, leading cadres fail to grasp the key points of work, do not conduct in-depth inspections, and neglect the ideological leadership of medical staff. They even reject criticism and do not listen to the opinions of the masses. For example, Heilongjiang Provincial People's Hospital, after inspection by the Provincial People's Supervisory Committee, found more than 50 cases of errors in treatment work, some of which endangered patients' lives. In the hospital's surgical treatment of patients, the rate of postoperative suppuration was 80%; the pharmacy department made six or seven mistakes in dispensing medicines and misreading dosages within half a year. The leadership did not promptly understand the situation regarding these continuously occurring problems, nor did they investigate responsibility and correct them. There was disunity among the leading cadres of the hospital, they did not study instructions from higher authorities, and the implementation of various systems was inadequate. Staff members often reflected that "hospital work has a beginning but no end." Regarding medical staff, they sometimes adopted an unprincipled attitude of accommodation, failing to grasp ideological leadership, with no praise or criticism, cultivating an irresponsible attitude among some staff. The Changjiang Daily pointed out in its report on the work of Wuhan Municipal First Hospital: President Sun Wenhua was divorced from the masses, rejected criticism, and spent his days busy attending meetings or sitting in his office approving official documents, but did not have a sufficient understanding of the work of the entire hospital. He usually did not pay attention to the opinions raised by the masses; especially when patients raised opinions on the hospital's work, regardless of whether they were correct or not, they were all regarded as "deliberately making things difficult." As a result, problems continued to occur in treatment, nursing, and hospital management, and many patients wrote letters to the Changjiang Daily criticizing the hospital's shortcomings. The Fujian Daily also reported on the bureaucracy in the leadership of hospitals directly under the Fujian Provincial Health Department: the hospital did not have an attendance system, criticism and praise were not done enough, and there was a lack of inspection. Therefore, some medical staff were not serious enough in their work and even adopted a perfunctory attitude. This newspaper has also continuously received many criticisms from readers about the work of Beijing North China People's Hospital (some of which were published in "People's Garden" on July 5th and August 3rd). Recently, the hospital said in its work review that although the leadership knew in the past that there were shortcomings in treatment and nursing, it did not conduct a serious review, but instead made excuses to perfunctorily appease patients' families.

Certain medical staff are irresponsible, retaining remnants of the bad ideological work style of the Kuomintang regime.

Second, related to the bureaucracy of the leadership is the irresponsible work style of some medical staff. For example, the North China People's Hospital admitted in its review that there were indeed remnants of the old Kuomintang military doctor style, and some medical staff did not fulfill their duties during examinations and did not have the idea of serving patients. Doctors in the hospital's internal medicine department expressed dissatisfaction with inviting outside doctors for consultation, saying strange things; some doctors who did not know how also pretended to know how, and recklessly performed surgery in order to "show off," thus increasing the patient's suffering. In hospitals directly under the Fujian Provincial Health Department, the old habit of looking down on poor patients among individual nurses was still very strong, and they were indifferent to patients. There was even an incident where a seriously ill patient in the pulmonary department was soaked in the rain from a leaky roof all night. Some medical staff at Heilongjiang Provincial Hospital still had the idea that "technology is above everything else, and having technology means you can eat anywhere in the country." Political study in some hospitals is very poor. The Changjiang Daily reported that the political atmosphere in Wuhan Municipal First Hospital was extremely thin, and people rarely read newspapers. As a result, nurses generally had a very poor service spirit. Some patients were not used to calling them "Miss" or "Mrs.," and if they called them "Nurse," they would not be paid attention to; some medical staff had no sense of responsibility. In the first half of June, several patients who had their appendix removed suppurated one after another due to incomplete disinfection; some employees also deceived leading cadres who did not recognize Latin, writing "anti-inflammatory pills" on prescriptions but saying they were aspirin.

The work system is unsound, management is poor, resulting in chaos and waste.

Third, the work system in some hospitals is unsound, and even retains some unreasonable systems from the Kuomintang regime. For example, in Heilongjiang Provincial Hospital, leading cadres have a division of responsibilities, but they do not cooperate, contact each other, or exchange information, and some things are shirked to each other. Wuchang Hubei Provincial People's Hospital also has a chaotic system, complicated procedures, and poor management. In terms of financial revenue and expenditure, it did not implement a budget system or cost accounting, and the review work was also very poor. The management of patients' meals in several hospitals was very poor, and patients paid a lot but the meals were not good. Fraudulent incidents have also occurred in hospitals directly under the Fujian Provincial Health Department. The Tianjin Daily published a reader's letter on the 8th of this month, pointing out some unreasonable aspects of the work system in the city's Third Hospital. "Resident doctors" and "interns" sometimes work shifts for 24 hours, which affects the effect of diagnosis and treatment, and also hinders the health of doctors. In addition, some hospitals, regardless of the actual situation, sometimes mechanically emphasize the system for special seriously ill patients, and cannot be admitted without completing the procedures.

Leading organs and supervisory organs conduct inspection and correction.

Some of these problems have attracted the attention of leading organs and people's supervisory organs. Based on the feedback from the masses, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Supervisory Committee formed a hospital work inspection team and inspected the work of the province's Provincial Hospital. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government has made a decision based on the inspection results, punishing some derelict personnel, and ordering the Provincial Health Department and the hospital's leadership to conduct a review and formulate measures to improve work. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Culture and Education, and the Health Department jointly formed an inspection committee, which inspected the work of Wuchang Hubei Provincial Hospital in late July. The Wuhan Municipal People's Supervisory Committee also inspected the work of Wuhan Municipal First Hospital together with relevant departments. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government is also sending people to inspect the work of the North China People's Hospital. In addition, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government issued instructions at the beginning of this month, ordering the Health Bureau to quickly inspect and correct the bureaucratic work style of hospital staff.

　　黑龙江湖北等地检查医院工作
    纠正医务工作上的不良作风
    领导干部有官僚主义，不检查工作，拒绝批评，忽视医务工作人员的思想领导。
    【本报讯】解放以来，在人民政府的正确领导与广大医务工作者的努力之下，各地卫生医疗工作获得了显著的进步，但工作中还有不少缺点。最近各地报纸上曾刊出一部分批评医院工作的新闻和读者来信，揭露了某些医院领导上的官僚主义和一部分医务工作人员不负责任的工作作风。有的已引起有关领导机关和人民监察机关的注意，正在检查纠正。这些医院，包括黑龙江省立医院、武汉市立第一医院、武昌湖北省立人民医院、福建省卫生厅直属医院、北京华北人民医院和天津市立的某些医院等。它们都是规模较大，技术设备较好，而且是在高级卫生行政机关直接领导之下的医院。据各报所载，这些医院领导上相当普遍地存在着严重的官僚主义。首先，是领导干部抓不住工作重点，不深入检查工作，忽视对医务工作人员的思想领导。甚至拒绝批评，不听群众意见。如黑龙江省立人民医院，经该省人民监察委员会检查，发现了治疗工作中的错误事件五十多起。其中有的曾危害了病人的生命。该院外科治疗患者，动手术后化脓的占百分之八十；药剂科在半年中发生了六、七次配错药、看错份量的事件。对这些连续发生的问题，领导上均未及时了解情况，没有追究责任，加以纠正。该院领导干部之间闹不团结，对上级指示不研究，贯彻各种制度不够。工作人员常反映“医院工作有头无尾”。对医务工作人员，有时采取无原则的迁就态度，不能抓紧思想领导，没有表扬和批评，养成一些工作人员不负责任的工作态度。长江日报在报道武汉市第一医院工作的新闻中指出：院长孙文华脱离群众，拒绝批评，整天不是忙于开会，就是坐在办公室里批核公文，但对全院工作却了解不够。平时对群众提的意见也不注意倾听；尤其是当病人对医院工作提出意见时，不管正确与否一律被视为“故意刁难”。结果治疗护理以及医院管理工作上连续发生问题，许多患者写信到长江日报批评该院的缺点。福建日报也报道了福建省卫生厅直属医院领导上的官僚主义：院方没有考勤制度，批评与表扬做得不够，缺乏检查，因此部分医务人员工作不够认真，甚至采取敷衍塞责的态度。本报也连续接到不少读者对北京华北人民医院工作的批评（其中一部分已于七月五日与八月三日在“人民园地”发表），最近该院在工作检讨中说，领导上过去虽然知道治疗上护理上有缺点，但没有作认真的检讨，反而有过找借口向病人家属搪塞的情事。
    某些医务人员不负责任，保持着国民党统治时期的恶劣思想作风的残余。
    第二，与领导上的官僚主义相联系的是某些医务人员不负责任的工作作风。如华北人民医院检讨出的确存在着国民党旧军医的残余作风，有些医务人员在检查时不尽职责，没有为病员服务的思想。该院内科大夫对邀请院外医师会诊表示不满，说怪话；有的大夫不会也假装会，为了要“露面”，冒然作手术，因之增加了病人的痛苦。福建省卫生厅直属医院，个别护士看不起穷苦病人的旧习气还很重，对病人漠不关心。甚至发生过让肺科重病患者在屋漏下淋浸一整夜的事件。黑龙江省立医院的某些医务人员，还有“技术高于一切，有技术吃遍全国”的思想。某些医院的政治学习是很差的。长江日报报道说：武汉市立第一医院院内政治气氛极为稀薄，平时大家连报纸也很少阅读。结果，护士们一般服务精神很差。有些病人不习惯喊“小姐”、“密司”，称她们“护士”就得不到理睬；部分医务人员没有责任感，该院在六月份上半月，因消毒不净，接连好几个病人割盲肠后都化了脓；某些职工还欺骗不认识拉丁文的领导干部，处方签上写着消炎片，却说是阿司匹林。
    工作制度不健全，管理不善，产生混乱浪费现象。
    第三，某些医院的工作制度不健全，甚至还保留着一部分国民党统治时期不合理的制度。如黑龙江省立医院，领导干部有责任上的分工，但不合作、不联系、不交换情况，有些事情互相推诿。武昌湖北省立人民医院，也是制度混乱，手续繁杂，管理不善。在财政收支上没有执行预算制度或成本会计，审查工作也很差。武汉市立第一医院的采购报销，长期间内没有发票，产生了不少浪费。对病人的伙食，好几个医院都管理得很差，病人付费多而伙食不好。福建省卫生厅直属医院还发生过舞弊事件。天津日报本月八日刊出一封读者来信，指出该市第三医院工作制度中某些不合理之处。“住院大夫”和“实习大夫”，有时值班二十四小时，影响了诊病效果，也妨碍了医生的健康。另外，某些医院不顾实际情况，有时对特殊的重病急病病人也机械地强调制度，不办好手续不能入院。
    领导机关与监察机关，进行检查纠正。
    这些问题，有的已引起领导机关与人民监察机关的注意。黑龙江省人民监察委员会根据群众反映，组成了医院工作检查组，检查了该省省立医院的工作。黑龙江省人民政府已根据检查结果作出决定，处分了一部分失职人员，并令省卫生处和该院领导上进行检讨，订出改进工作办法。中共湖北省委、省府民政厅、文教厅和卫生处，联合组成了检查委员会，在七月下旬检查了武昌湖北省立医院的工作，武汉市人民监察委员会亦会同有关部门检查了武汉市立第一医院的工作。对华北人民医院的工作，中央人民政府卫生部亦正派人检查。又天津市人民政府于本月初发出了指示，责成卫生局从速检查纠正医院工作人员的官僚主义作风。
