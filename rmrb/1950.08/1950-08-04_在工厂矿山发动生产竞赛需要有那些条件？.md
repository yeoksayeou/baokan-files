According to the report "Notes on the National Trade Union Production Conference" published in your newspaper on June 18th, the following conditions are required to carry out production competitions in enterprises:

(1) Production is relatively normal; (2) grassroots organizations have been established; (3) workers' new labor attitudes have begun to be established. However, in Hunan, we found some trade union work cadres who believe that these three conditions are not necessary, and even that competitions can be carried out without trade union organizations. Please answer us, are their views correct? Is it only with the above three conditions that competitions can be carried out?

Editor:

I have read Mr. Lei Xijia's article "Protecting the Basic Interests of the Working Class, Trade Unions Must Do a Good Job in Mass Production Work," published on the second page of your newspaper on June 18th, which is a communication about the National Trade Union Production Work Conference. I think the content of this communication is mainly based on Comrade Li Lisan's summary at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) production conference. However, there is a sentence in it, "According to the experience of Northeast and North China: wherever production is relatively normal, grassroots organizations have been established, and workers' new labor attitudes have begun to be established, competitions can be organized." I remember that this issue caused controversy at the ACFTU production conference at that time, and later Comrade Li Lisan affirmed in his summary: "As long as there is production and there are trade unions, competitions can be organized," completely negating the above-mentioned point of view. The above conditions were only mentioned when discussing the conditions for organizing city-wide production competitions. I don't know which is correct? Please reply.

Our Newspaper's Reply

New Hunan Daily Editorial Office and Comrade Li Chen:

Competition is the concrete manifestation of the working class's conscious labor and is the daily labor and lifestyle of the working masses. Therefore, as a mass organization of the working class—the trade union—it should use production competition as a regular working method. This shows that competition should be led by the trade union, that is, only with the establishment of a trade union organization can competition be carried out with leadership.

Factories and mines with trade union organizations and production can launch competitions. The content of the competition can be diverse, varying according to different production natures and production situations. It can increase output, improve quality, reduce costs, or save and reduce the consumption of raw materials and fuel, etc.

Therefore, we believe that as long as there is production and there is a trade union organization, competitions can be launched and organized.

Of course, to make the competition widespread, developing from within a factory or mine to a comprehensive competition in a city, it should have the conditions of relatively normal production, general factories and mines having production plans, workers' new labor attitudes having begun to be established, and relatively sound trade union organizations. As for an industry competition, it requires more conditions such as a unified wage system and labor protection treatment system.

When launching a competition within a factory or mine, it should also be launched on the basis of thorough preparation and publicity and education, and on the basis of the conscious and voluntary participation of the workers, and should not be launched only with general appeals or administrative methods.

The phrase "Based on the existing experience in Northeast and North China" in our newspaper's article "Notes on the National Trade Union Production Work Conference" refers to the conditions for comprehensive competitions in cities or regions. The so-called "grassroots organizations have been established" means that the trade union organizations of each factory and mine unit in a region have been established; other conditions are not aimed at a single factory or mine.

### 在工厂矿山发动生产竞赛需要有那些条件？

　　在工厂矿山发动生产竞赛需要有那些条件？
  新湖南报总编室来信编辑同志：
    根据你报六月十八日所刊载的《记全国工会生产会议》报道，在企业中开展生产竞赛，需有下列条件：
    （一）生产比较正常；（二）基层组织已经建立起来；（三）工人新的劳动态度已开始树立。但是在湖南发现有这样的工会工作干部，他们认为不一定要有这三个条件，甚至认为没有工会组织也可以开展竞赛。请你们回答我们一下，他们的看法是否对？究竟是不是有了以上三个条件才可以开展竞赛？

    李晨同志来信编辑同志：
    六月十八日贵报第二版所刊雷希嘉先生的《保护工人阶级的基本利益，工会要作好群众生产工作》一篇记全国工会生产工作会议的通讯，我看这篇通讯的内容主要是根据全总生产会议立三同志的总结而写的。不过，里面有“根据东北和华北地区的经验：凡是生产比较正常，基层组织已经建立起来，而工人新的劳动态度已经开始树立，就可以组织竞赛”一句，我记得关于这一问题当时在全总生产会议上曾引起争论，后来立三同志在总结时曾肯定的提出：“只要有了生产，有了工会，就可以组织竞赛，”已完全否定了上面所引述的那一论点。只是在谈到组织全市性的生产竞赛的条件时才提出上述的几个条件。不知何者为正确？请答复。

    本报的答复新湖南报总编室及李晨同志：
    竞赛是工人阶级自觉劳动的具体表现，是工人群众的日常劳动方式和生活方式。因此作为工人阶级的群众组织——工会，应当以生产竞赛作为经常的工作方法。这说明，竞赛应当由工会来领导，也就是说只有建立了工会组织，才能有领导的开展竞赛。
    有了工会组织，又有生产的厂矿，就可以发动竞赛。竞赛的内容是可以多样的，随着不同的生产性质和生产情况而有所不同。可以提高产量，可以提高质量，可以降低成本，也可以是节约，减低原材料和燃料的消耗等等。
    所以我们认为：只要有生产，有了工会组织，就可以发动与组织竞赛。
    当然，要使竞赛广泛开展，由厂矿内部发展到一个城市的全面竞赛，那是应该具有生产比较正常，一般厂矿均有了生产计划，工人的新的劳动态度已开始树立，工会组织比较健全的条件。至于一个产业的竞赛，更需要统一的工资制度、劳保待遇制度等条件。
    在一个厂矿内部发动竞赛时，也应该是经过周密的准备和宣传教育，在工人群众自觉自愿的基础上发动起来，不能仅有一般号召，或用行政方式去发动。
    本报《记全国工会生产工作会议》一文中“根据东北和华北地区现有的经验”，系指城市或区域性的全面竞赛的条件。所谓“基层组织已经建立”，就是一个地区的每一厂矿单位工会组织已经建立；其他条件也不是针对一个厂矿提出的。      编者
