Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, August 25th: The Tianjin Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau recently cracked a military espionage organization of the Kuomintang remnants, the "Lu Xi Anti-Communist People's Self-Defense Salvation Army First Column." The masterminds, Luo Jinbiao, Wu Lanfang, and Lu Xingjie, and accomplices Xu Yizhen, Zheng Zhenbei, and 20 others were all arrested. The ringleaders Zhao Jiesan and Qiao Hongen were also captured in Jinan, and documents such as appointment orders and official seals were seized.

This espionage organization was under the command of Li Yutang, the bandit "Commander-in-Chief of the Shandong Pacification and Chairman of Shandong Province," who fled to Hong Kong. The ringleader Zhao Jiesan was formerly a lieutenant colonel captain in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit National Defense Ministry's Officer Corps. After the liberation of Jinan, he and the Kuomintang secret agent Qiao Hongen fled to Guangzhou. After receiving special agent training in Guangzhou, Li Yutang granted them the title of "Lu Xi Anti-Communist People's Self-Defense Salvation Army First Column," and Zhao was appointed as "Commander." In August of last year, Zhao and Qiao sneaked into Jinan and established contact points in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. In Jinan, they colluded with the puppet military officer Luo Jinbiao (who served as a regimental commander in Qi Zixiu's puppet army in Shandong during the Japanese puppet regime), giving him the title of "First Detachment." In November of last year, Zhao, Qiao, and Luo sneaked into Tianjin and made contact with Wu Lanfang, a traitorous county magistrate of Guantao County, Shandong during the Japanese puppet regime (who served as the Quartermaster of the Kuomintang Shandong Cavalry Special Service Brigade after the Japanese surrender), and appointed Wu as "Deputy Commander."

The method of operation of this espionage organization was to use the business of buying and selling jujubes and wool as a cover, with warehouses as strongholds. They used various relationships to recruit Kuomintang and Japanese puppet regime's scattered soldiers, puppet police, and military police, and used threats and inducements to win over and blackmail backward merchants to solve funding problems. The bandits planned to establish command structures with Tianjin and Jinan as bases, and to use counties such as Liaocheng, Shenxian, Chaocheng, Yanggu, Linqing, and Guantao in Shandong Province as areas of activity, attempting to lie low in a dispersed manner for a long time and carry out sabotage. Currently, their main focus is on separately attracting former colleagues and subordinates, and actively developing reactionary organizations.

The activities of the bandits were detected by the public security organs of the People's Government from the very beginning. After careful investigation, in addition to the masterminds and accomplices lurking in this city who have been captured by the city's Public Security Bureau, the ringleaders Zhao Jiesan and Qiao Hongen, and others, who were lurking in Jinan, have also been captured by the Jinan Public Security Bureau.

　　天津破获军事特务组织
    主犯从犯二十五人全部落网
    匪首赵杰三等亦在济南就逮
    【新华社天津二十五日电】天津市人民政府公安局近破获国民党残匪“鲁西反共人民自卫救国军第一纵队”军事特务组织。主犯罗金标、吴兰芳、路兴阶及从犯许一珍、郑振北等二十五人全部落网。匪首赵杰三、乔洪恩亦已在济南捕获，并搜出派令、关防等证件。
    该特务组织系受逃匿在香港的匪“山东绥靖总司令兼山东省主席”李玉堂指挥。匪首赵杰三曾任蒋匪国防部军官总队的中校队长，于济南解放后和军统特务乔洪恩逃往广州。在广州受了特务训练后，由李匪玉堂予以“鲁西反共人民自卫救国军第一纵队”番号，赵匪被任为“司令”。去年八月间，赵、乔二匪潜入济南，并在上海、南京等地建立联系据点。在济南勾结伪军官罗金标（日伪时期在山东伪军齐子修部任团长），给以“第一支队”番号。去年十一月间，赵、乔、罗三匪潜来天津，与日伪时期山东馆陶县汉奸县长吴兰芳（日本投降后任国民党山东骑兵特务旅军需处长）取得联系，并委吴匪为“副司令”。
    该特务组织活动的方法是以买卖红枣、羊毛等行商为掩护，以货栈为据点，利用各种关系，网罗国民党及日伪时期的流散军人、伪警察和宪兵等，并采用威胁利诱手段，拉拢和敲诈落后商人，以解决经费问题。匪等计划以天津、济南为基点，建立指挥机构，以山东省聊城、莘县、朝城、阳谷、临清、馆陶等县为活动地区，企图长期分散潜伏，进行破坏；目前主要是分头拉拢旧同事、旧部下，积极发展反动组织。
    匪等开始进行活动时，即为人民政府公安机关侦悉。经缜密调查，该案主从犯除潜伏本市者已由本市公安局捕获外，潜伏济南的匪首赵杰三和乔洪恩等，亦已由济南公安局捕获。
