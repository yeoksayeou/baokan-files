　　Speech by Ma Xulun, Chairman of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, at the rally celebrating "August 1st" Army Day and opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea:

　　Today is the Army Day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Twenty-three years ago today, the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Chinese Communist Party, established their own revolutionary armed forces for the first time. After more than twenty years of revolutionary war and countless sacrifices, this force has grown from a few thousand people into a powerful national defense force of five million, overthrowing imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and liberating mainland China. The people of China are now able to enjoy liberation and a democratic and free life. We cannot but celebrate the birth of this people's armed force with joy, and express our greatest gratitude to the heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army, and to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Chinese Communist Party who lead it.

　　Now, American imperialism and its running dog states are frantically slaughtering the Korean people, attempting to use planes and artillery to prevent Korean independence and reunification. At the same time, the American fleet has sailed to Taiwan to help the dying remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang,妄想企图阻止妄想企图阻止us from liberating Taiwan. But these aggressors and war peddlers have already suffered a shameful defeat. The heroic Korean People's Army, with the support of the entire nation, has driven the American army into a frenzy. They have been defeated again and again, and it seems they are about to be driven into the sea. Like the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Korean People's Army is able to defeat American aggression because they are revolutionary armed forces, soldiers of the people, they have a high degree of political consciousness, and for the freedom and liberation of their motherland, they fear no difficulties or sacrifices.

　　The glorious victory of the Korean People's Army once again powerfully proves that the people's revolutionary armed forces are invincible, and with the support of the broad masses, they can certainly defeat any foreign aggression.

　　The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, who have already driven the Japanese and American aggressive forces and their running dogs out of mainland China, are even more confident of driving the American aggressors and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang out of Taiwan and liberating every inch of Chinese territory.

　　Today, as we warmly celebrate the Army Day of the People's Liberation Army, we want to tell American imperialism and its running dog states: China, Korea, and all oppressed nations in Asia are determined, powerful, and confident of defeating all aggression. The revolutionary armed forces of the Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese people are an invincible force with the support of the broad masses.

　　We must mobilize all our strength to oppose American imperialist aggression, and we must support the revolutionary war of the Korean people who are fighting heroically for independence and liberation.

　　We must strengthen our unity and work hard to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and completely drive imperialism out of Asia!

　　We must resolutely fight to defend world peace!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

　　Long live the great unity of the people of the world!

　　中国民主促进会主席
    马叙伦的演说
    【新华社一日讯】中国民主促进会主席马叙伦在庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的演说：
    今天是中国人民解放军的建军节。二十三年前的今天，中国人民在毛主席朱总司令和中国共产党领导下第一次成立了自己的革命武装部队。这个部队经过二十几年革命战争的锻炼，经过了无数次的流血牺牲，从几千人已经成长为五百万人的强大的国防军，打倒了帝国主义和国民党的反动统治，解放了中国大陆。全中国人民今天能够得到解放，享受民主自由的生活，对这个人民武装诞生的日子不能不欢欣庆祝，对英勇无敌的人民解放军和领导他的毛主席朱总司令和中国共产党，不能不表示最大的感谢。
    现在美帝国主义和他的走狗国家正在疯狂地屠杀朝鲜人民，想用飞机大炮来阻止朝鲜的独立和统一。同时，美国舰队又开到台湾，帮助垂死的蒋介石残余匪帮，妄想阻止我们解放台湾。但是这些侵略者和战争贩子已经遭到了可耻的失败。英勇的朝鲜人民军在全国人民支持之下已经把美国军队打得团团转。他们一败再败，眼看就要被赶到海里去了。和中国人民解放军一样，朝鲜人民军所以能够打败美国的侵略，因为他们是革命的武装，是人民的子弟兵，他们有高度的政治觉悟，为了祖国的自由解放，他们不怕任何困难和牺牲。
    朝鲜人民军的辉煌胜利，又一次有力地证明：人民的革命武装是不可战胜的，在广大群众拥护之下一定可以打败任何外国的侵略。
    已经把日本和美国侵略势力和他们的走狗赶出中国大陆的中国人民和人民解放军，一定更有把握把美国侵略者和蒋介石残余匪帮赶出台湾，解放全中国的每一寸土地。
    我们今天热烈庆祝人民解放军的建军节，就是要告诉美帝国主义和他的走狗国家：中国、朝鲜和全亚洲被压迫民族是有决心，有力量，有把握打败一切侵略的。中国，朝鲜，越南人民的革命的武装在广大人民拥护之下是不可战胜的力量。
    我们要动员一切力量来反对美帝侵略，我们要声援为争取独立解放而英勇战斗的朝鲜人民的革命战争。
    我们要以加强团结，努力工作来拥护人民解放军解放台湾，把帝国主义完全赶出亚洲！
    我们要坚决为保卫世界和平而奋斗！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
