　　Answering Readers' Questions on Several Issues Concerning Party Building
  I. Why shouldn't new liberated areas generally develop Party organizations in rural areas before land reform? Why should old liberated areas generally stop recruiting Party members in rural areas?
    Editor: After reading Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation," I have the following questions regarding the consolidation and development of Party organizations. Please answer them: Why shouldn't new liberated areas generally develop Party organizations in rural areas before land reform is completed? Wouldn't developing Party members during land reform better increase the backbone of the land reform movement? Why could old and semi-old rural areas develop Party members during land reform in the past? Why are old areas now generally stopping recruiting Party members as well? Wouldn't it be more advantageous to recruit activists from various movements into the Party now?
            Lin Chen, Propaganda Department of the Yanqing County Committee of the Communist Party of China
    Comrade Lin Chen:
    New liberated areas should generally not develop Party organizations in rural areas before land reform is completed. This is because: developing Party organizations in any area requires the following conditions: the masses have been widely mobilized, mass organizations have been universally established, and the vast number of activists have not only been discovered but have also been tested through a certain amount of work and struggle, and their political consciousness has been significantly improved. Generally speaking, these conditions are impossible to meet in the rural areas of new liberated areas before land reform is completed. Prematurely developing Party organizations will inevitably lead to the recruitment of unqualified elements, even the infiltration of opportunists and class enemies, damaging the purity of the Party and reducing the Party's leading role. Even after land reform is completed and the above conditions are met, much necessary preparatory work for Party building must be done, such as carrying out universal and in-depth Party building education, as well as training Party building backbones, before starting to recruit Party members. If it is believed that Party development work can be carried out immediately after land reform is completed, the result will be that the Party organization is built on an insecure foundation. Local experiences have proven this point. As for why old and semi-old areas could develop Party members during land reform in the past, it was because the Party in these areas had a considerable work foundation, and the political consciousness and organization of the masses were also different from those in the new areas, and the outstanding elements discovered had been tested through struggle.
    So, how can the leadership backbone problem of land reform be solved in rural areas of the new areas without Party organizations? Comrade Liu Shaoqi instructed in his report on land reform issues at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "Activists among upright peasants and land reform work cadres sent to the countryside should become the backbone of land reform." As long as these land reform work cadres can correctly grasp the policies and laws of the Party and the People's Government, resolutely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to unite the middle peasants, and give play to the role of the peasant associations, they can ensure the smooth progress of land reform work.
    Why should Party development generally be stopped in rural areas of the old areas? On the one hand, the number of Party members in rural areas of the old areas is already very large, and most outstanding elements have already joined the Party; on the other hand, because they were in a tense war environment in the past and the tasks were heavy, the Party did not have time to give systematic education to Party members before and after they joined the Party. Therefore, the level of consciousness of many Party members is not high, and the Party organization is not solid enough, and it is now urgently needed to be rectified. Therefore, the Central Committee decided that the Party in the old areas should generally stop developing in order to focus on rectification and education work.

        II. Should accepting Party members be based mainly on class background or ideological consciousness?
    Editor:
    When we were taking Party classes, we discussed whether the criteria for accepting Party members should be based mainly on class background or ideological consciousness. Everyone debated for a long time, some said it should be based on class background, some said it should be based on ideological consciousness, each with their own reasons. It has been more than two months, and we have not reached a conclusion. Which opinion is correct? Please answer us.
            Cheng Pu, No. 1 Team, Education Brigade, 20th Army Corps
    Comrade Cheng Pu:
    When accepting Party members, it is necessary to follow the provisions of Article 1 of the Party Constitution: "Recognize the Party Program and Party Constitution, participate in a Party organization and work in it, obey the Party's resolutions, and pay Party dues." This shows that the person being accepted into the Party must truly join the Party organization, obey the organization in everything, and be willing to contribute themselves to the Party's cause, the cause of communism. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his book "On the Party": "If the Party member's level of consciousness is not high, and he cannot understand the foundation of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, then he cannot be a good Party member, and cannot consciously fight well for the cause of the people." He also said: "The organizational unity of the Party is first of all premised on the ideological consistency of Party members created by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought." Therefore, Party members who are admitted into the Party must be activists in the national struggle, class struggle, and production struggle. If in the army, factory, or government, then those admitted into the Party must be advanced elements in combat and in various tasks. If in the countryside, then those admitted into the Party must be advanced elements in the struggle against the enemy, in land reform, in the production movement, and in other revolutionary movements. This shows that it is mainly based on the ideological consciousness of those being admitted into the Party, not class background.
    However, when recruiting Party members, attention must also be paid to their social background. Because the Communist Party is the political party of the working class, and in today's Chinese society where classes still exist, especially in the current period of revolutionary victory, in order to prevent the infiltration of class enemies and wavering elements, and to improve the composition of the Party in a planned and step-by-step manner, in order to smoothly realize the task of the vanguard, Article 4 of the Party Constitution stipulates that admission into the Party must be carried out separately according to the different social status (i.e., different class background) of those being accepted. This is why the Party Central Committee has stipulated that the focus of Party development in the future should be industrial workers. This is completely different from the theory of only considering class background.

        III. Can those who have withdrawn from the Party restore their Party membership, or reapply to join the Party?
    Editor:
    I have two questions, please answer them:
    (1) Can those who left the Communist Party due to ideological wavering or dissatisfaction with the leadership, and later regretted it and requested to restore their Party membership?
    (2) Can those who did not engage in any counter-revolutionary activities after withdrawing from the Party, and have been particularly active in their work and study, reapply to join the Party?
        Li Sheng, Reading Group, Yuekou Branch of the Tianmen Middle School of Hubei Province
    Comrade Li Sheng:
    The Constitution of the Communist Party of China stipulates that Party members have the freedom to withdraw from the Party. But when a Party member requests to withdraw from the Party, no matter what the reason or justification, he has lost the basic conditions of a Communist Party member. As mentioned in the letter, those who "left the Communist Party due to ideological wavering or dissatisfaction with the then leader" are also lacking a firm revolutionary outlook on life, and therefore can easily waver their revolutionary confidence and determination to struggle for the cause of communism and leave the Party ranks for some matter. Since such people have already left the Party organizationally or ideologically, the Party naturally cannot recognize them as a Party member, so there is no question of restoring their Party membership.
    As for those who have not engaged in counter-revolutionary activities after withdrawing from the Party and have been actively working and studying, they can of course reapply to join the Party. However, withdrawing from the Party is free, but joining the Party is conditional, especially for those who have withdrawn from the Party. The Party committee must conduct a serious investigation of him, and only when there are factual proofs that he is still loyal to the revolutionary cause during his withdrawal from the Party can he consider his re-entry into the Party. Comrade Liu Shaoqi has instructed on this issue in "On the Party": "Those who have joined our Party, later withdrew, and requested to rejoin the Party, should go through the formalities for joining the Party in accordance with the fourth category (i.e., the provisions of Article 4, Item D of the Party Constitution. - Editor): because such people have undergone political wavering, they must have experienced Party members to introduce them, and must be reviewed by a relatively senior Party committee."

### 关于建党工作中的几个问题答读者问

　　关于建党工作中的几个问题答读者问
  一、为什么新解放区在土地改革前一般地不应在农村中发展党的
    组织？老解放区一般地应停止在农村中吸收党员？
    编者同志：我读了毛主席在中共三中全会的报告《为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争》后，对巩固和发展党的组织问题上，有以下几点疑问，请予解答：为什么新解放区在土地改革完成以前，一般地不应在农村中发展党的组织？在土地改革期间发展党员，不是更可以增加土地改革运动的骨干吗？过去老区、半老区农村在土地改革期间为什么可以发展党员？现在的老区为什么也一般地停止吸收党员？现在吸收各种运动中的积极分子入党不是更为有利吗？
            中共延庆县委宣传部  林辰林辰同志：
    新解放区在土地改革完成以前，一般地不应在农村中发展党的组织。这是因为：不论在任何地区发展党的组织，都必须具备以下条件：群众已经广泛发动，群众组织已普遍建立，广大的积极分子不仅被发现，而且已经过一定的工作和斗争的考验，其政治觉悟已有显著地提高以后。一般说来，新解放区农村中在土地改革完成以前，是不可能具备这些条件的。如过早地发展党的组织，必然会将条件不够的分子吸收入党，甚至混进投机分子和阶级异己分子，损害党的纯洁性，降低党的领导作用。即使在土地改革完成以后，上述条件已经具备，但还必须作许多必要的建党准备工作，如进行普遍深入的建党教育，以及训练建党骨干等才能开始吸收党员。假如认为土地改革完成后即可进行发展党的工作，其结果也会使党的组织建立在不巩固的基础上，各地经验，已证明此点。至于过去老区半老区在土地改革期间可以发展党的组织，是因为这些地区党已有了相当时间的工作基础，群众的政治觉悟和组织情况也都与新区不同，所发现的优秀分子已经过斗争考验的原故。
    那么，新区农村没有党的组织，如何解决土地改革的领导骨干问题呢？刘少奇同志在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上关于土地改革问题的报告中指示说：“正派的农民中的积极分子和派到乡村中的土地改革工作干部，应该成为土地改革中的骨干。”只要这些土地改革工作干部能够正确地掌握党和人民政府的政策法令，坚决地依靠贫雇农团结中农，并发挥农民协会的作用，便能够保证土地改革工作的顺利进行。
    在老区农村中为什么一般地停止发展党呢？一方面是因为老区农村中党员的数量上已甚为庞大，一般优秀分子大部已入党；另一方面又因为过去处在紧张的战争环境，任务繁重，在党员入党前后党来不及给予系统的教育，因此，许多党员的觉悟水平不高，党的组织不够巩固，现在急需加以整理。中央因此决定老区的党一般地应停止发展，以便全力进行整理教育工作。
        编者
        二、接受党员依成份为主还是依思想觉悟为主？编辑同志：
    我们上党课时，曾讨论到接受党员入党的标准是依据成份为主，还是依据思想觉悟为主的问题。大家争论好久，有的说应以成份为主，有的说以思想觉悟为主，各有各的理由。至今已有两个多月，还没有得出结论。到底那个意见对呢？请你们解答。
            二十兵团教导大队一队伍  成璞成璞同志：
    接受党员时必须按照党章第一条规定：“承认党纲党章，参加党的一个组织并在其中工作，服从党的决议，并缴纳党费。”这就说明了，被接受入党的人必须是真正加入党的组织，一切服从组织和愿意将自己贡献给党的事业、共产主义事业的人。刘少奇同志在《论党》一书中曾指出：“如果党员的觉悟程度不高，对于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础不能领会，那他就不能作一个很好的党员，不能自觉地很好地为人民的事业而奋斗。”他又说：“党的组织上的统一，首先是由马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想所造成的党员在思想上的一致为其前提的。”所以被吸收入党的党员，一定是在民族斗争、阶级斗争及生产斗争中的积极分子。如果在部队、工厂、机关，那么被吸收入党的一定是战斗中，各种工作中的先进分子。如果在农村，那么被吸收入党的，一定是对敌斗争中，土地改革中，生产运动中，及其他革命运动中的先进分子。这就说明了主要依据的是被吸收入党者的思想觉悟而不是成份。
    但是接收党员时，必须同时注意其社会成份。因为共产党是工人阶级的政党，处在今天中国尚存在阶级的社会情况下，尤其是在目前革命胜利的时期，为了防止阶级异己分子和不坚定分子的混入，有计划有步骤地改善党的成份，以顺利实现先锋队的任务，所以党章第四条规定必须按被接受者的不同的社会地位（即不同成份）分别接受入党。这就是党中央规定今后发展党的重点应是产业工人的原因。这与唯成份论是完全不同的。
              编者
        三、脱党者是否可以恢复党籍，或重新申请入党？编者同志：
    今有二个问题请予解答：
    （一）因思想不坚定或对领导上不满而一时冲动脱离共产党者，事后悔悟请求恢复党籍是否可以？
    （二）脱党后未从事任何反革命活动，在以后的工作与学习中表现特别积极，是否可以重新申请入党？
        湖北省立天门中学岳口分部读报小组力生力生同志：
    中国共产党党章规定党员有退党的自由。但当一个党员要求退党时，不管有什么原因和理由，但他已经丧失了共产党员的起码条件。如来信中所说，因为“思想不坚定或因对当时领导人不满而一时冲动脱离共产党的人”，同样是因为缺乏坚定的革命人生观，因而可以随便为着一点什么事情，而动摇自己为共产主义事业奋斗的革命信心与决心，离开党的队伍。这样的人既然在组织上或思想上都已经离开了党，党自然不能承认他是一个党员，那就无从谈起恢复他的党籍问题了。
    至于退党后并未从事反革命活动，并积极工作与学习的人，当然可以重新申请入党。但是退党是自由的，入党则是有条件的，特别是对于脱党者。党委必须对他进行认真的考察，在确有事实证明其在脱党期间仍然忠实于革命事业时，方可考虑其重新入党的问题。这一问题刘少奇同志在“论党”中曾有指示：“凡曾参加我党，后来退出，要求再入党者，照第四类（即党章第四条丁项规定。——编者）履行入党手续：因为这种人经过政治上的动摇，须有经验的党员来作介绍，并须有比较高级党委的审查。”
