    Yaojiazhuang Village, Zhao County, Hebei Province, Rapidly Completes Wheat Tax Task
    The Yaojiazhuang Village branch in Zhao County, Hebei, followed the mass line in the wheat tax collection, thus quickly completing the wheat tax task. In this wheat collection, they adopted these methods: First, they did a good job of propaganda and mobilization before the wheat collection. Branch Secretary Yao Qinlan led Party members to carry out wheat collection propaganda in response to the ideological situation of the masses. Under the leadership of Party members, they actively prepared for wheat collection. This time, half of the households in the village dried wheat to hand in good wheat. Secondly, when evaluating households for reduction or exemption, they absorbed people from all aspects, such as representatives of the three-level people's congress, representatives of mutual aid groups, etc. And solicited opinions from the masses at mass meetings. When checking wheat fields, Party member cadres explained the policies to the masses and led the masses to self-report. After the self-reporting, it was announced at the mass meeting for the masses to check.
