　　In the rectification movement in the provincial-level organizations of Heilongjiang, and city-level organizations of Jinzhou in Liaoxi, and Jiamusi in Songjiang, it was discovered that some leading cadres in some units were suppressing democracy and rejecting criticism. These leaders forgot the directive of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China regarding the work of rectifying the Party and cadres, which stipulated: "The main method of this rectification movement is to read certain designated documents, summarize work, analyze the situation, and展开批评与自我批评 (launch criticism and self-criticism)." They used various excuses to limit the opinions of their subordinates on the leadership. Some leading comrades in some units in Jiamusi City, Songjiang Province, did not accept incomplete criticisms; and determined their degree of acceptance based on the attitude of those who offered the opinions. Even when some ideologically backward comrades offered opinions, they were rejected outright as "strange talk," or accepted in words but not in practice. Individual leading cadres in organs in Jinzhou City, Liaoxi, similarly adopted methods to limit the offering of opinions, emphasizing the need to raise major issues and emphasizing how the attitude of offering opinions should be. A certain section chief of a machinery factory even said to the chairman of the trade union who offered opinions: "You are the masters, and I am the capitalist. I dare not do anything to you!" Some responsible comrades in the Heilongjiang provincial-level organs could remain calm when others raised some issues about living standards, but would get angry when work and policy issues were raised. Some even wrote notes to those who offered them opinions, asking them to be more "objective." These leaders do not understand that if they demand that the criticisms from below be 100% correct, they will eliminate any possibility of criticism from below; they are unwilling to first consider whether the opinions offered by others are correct and whether they are beneficial to improving work. If it is indeed beneficial to the work, even if the attitude of the person offering the opinion is not good, it should not affect the acceptance of the correct opinion. As for the bad habit of accepting superficially but not changing in practice, it is something that Communist Party members and personnel of the People's Government should never have. Because the leadership suppressed democracy, some cadres no longer dared to offer opinions to their superiors, fearing that they would be retaliated against and made difficult by their superiors. After discovering these problems, the Party committees in various places have been correcting them separately. The Jinzhou Municipal Party Committee has also put forward specific improvement suggestions, requiring leaders at all levels to implement the spirit of rectification, promote democracy, and conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism. There should be no restrictions on the opinions of the masses, but rather, principle issues should be found from the analysis of specific, fragmented opinions.

　　锦州佳木斯等地部分领导同志
    整风运动中压制批评
    当地党委已注意纠正
    【本报讯】东北黑龙江省级机关和辽西锦州市，松江佳木斯市级机关整风运动中，发现部分单位领导干部压制民主，拒绝批评。这些领导者忘记了中共中央关于整党整干工作的指示中规定的：“此次整风运动的主要方式，是阅读某些指定的文件，总结工作，分析情况，展开批评与自我批评。”而以各种借口，限制下级同志对领导上提意见。松江省佳木斯市某些单位某些领导同志对不完全的批评不接受；并根据提意见者的态度来决定自己的接受程度。甚至当某些思想较落后的同志提出意见时，竟说是“怪话”而一概拒绝，或者是口头上接受了，实际上却不接受。辽西锦州市个别机关领导干部同样采取限制提意见的办法，强调要提大问题，强调提意见的态度应如何如何。机械厂某科长竟然对提意见的工会主任说：“你们是主人翁，我是资本家，我不敢把你怎的！”黑龙江省级机关有些负责同志当别人提些生活问题时还能沉得住气，一提工作和政策的问题就生气，有人甚至给向自己提意见的人写条子要人家“客观”点。这些领导者不懂得假使要求下面的批评百分之百的正确，必将消灭任何来自下面的批评的可能性；不肯首先考虑别人所提的意见是否正确，对于改进工作是否有益。假使对工作确有好处的话，即使提意见者的态度不好，也决不能影响到对正确意见的接受。至于表面接受、实际不改的恶劣作风，则更是共产党员、人民政府的工作人员所绝不应有。由于领导上压制民主，有些干部已不敢给上级提意见，怕提了意见后被上级报复为难。各地党委发现这些问题后，已分别进行纠正，锦州市委并提出具体改进意见，要求各级领导贯彻整风精神，发扬民主，认真展开批评与自我批评。对群众意见不应有所限制，而应从分析具体的零碎意见中找出原则问题。
