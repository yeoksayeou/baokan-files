　　Celebrating the 23rd Anniversary of the Heroic and Invincible People's Liberation Army
　　Liu Bocheng
　　Our heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army is twenty-three years old this August 1st. At this time, our people across the country are resolutely opposing the armed aggression of Taiwan and Korea by the American imperialists, and are unanimously implementing Chairman Mao's instructions: to strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation.
　　Since the birth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on August 1, 1927, our armed people have begun a heroic struggle against armed counter-revolution, and have written a glorious history of constantly defeating counter-revolution in the continuous struggle over the past twenty-three years. During the period of the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation in the Great Revolution, at a critical moment of the revolution, the Kuomintang group headed by Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, turning the blade pointing at the enemy—feudalism and imperialism—to slaughter the people. But the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people were not frightened by them, and rose from the underground to continue their heroic struggle against the enemy. At that time, our army had only 30,000 men in the Nanchang Uprising.
　　From "August 1st," through the three periods of the Land Revolution War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has experienced twenty-three years of glorious historical road.
　　During the Land Revolution period, our army had only 60,000 men, who established base areas separately. Chiang Kai-shek launched four encirclement and suppression campaigns with huge forces, but all failed. In order to resist Japan, our army broke through the fifth encirclement and suppression and successfully carried out the 25,000-li Long March, reaching the front line of the War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　At the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army had only more than 50,000 men, fighting deep behind enemy lines in North China and Central China. At that time, Wang Jingwei's troops fought under the command of Japanese invaders, raising the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth with yellow ribbons; while Chiang Kai-shek hid in a corner of the southwest, passively resisting Japan, and launched several anti-communist and anti-people climaxes, making our operations behind enemy lines very difficult. At that time, our army closely combined with the broad masses of people behind enemy lines, fought together, repelled the enemy's repeated encirclement and suppression, stopped several anti-communist upsurges, and created vast liberated areas in North China, Central China, Northeast China, and South China, implementing rent reduction and interest reduction, and developing a regular army of about one million people and more than two million militiamen.
　　After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, Chiang Kai-shek violated the peace aspirations of the people of the whole country, and with the full support of the United States, launched an unprecedented large-scale counter-revolutionary civil war. Our army, after more than three years of war, grew stronger and stronger, defeated all the enemies, and liberated all the mainland except Tibet.
　　No matter in which period, our army has always united with the broad masses of the people to fight against the enemy under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. In repeated victorious struggles, it established base areas, and itself developed from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong, and finally defeated the enemy throughout the country. Now only Taiwan and Tibet remain to be liberated.
　　The reason why our Chinese People's Liberation Army is so heroic and invincible is because it was born under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party's Front Committee and has never been separated from the Party's leadership since then. Especially since the joining of forces at Jinggangshan, it has been unified under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, the political commissar representing the Communist Party. Under the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong, it has conducted political, military, and cultural education, established a new type of military system, and carried out a victorious revolutionary war. Such an army, cultivated by Comrade Mao Zedong, which combines with the broad masses of the people and serves the broad masses of the people, has demonstrated its heroic and invincible power in the twenty-three years of victorious revolutionary war.
　　Now the United States has launched a war of aggression against Korea and has brazenly invaded Taiwan. We must liberate Taiwan from the United States and eliminate the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits; and we have the responsibility to defend world peace.
　　We must maintain and carry forward the glorious traditions of our army, and further improve our combat effectiveness in the army, navy, and air force in order to achieve the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet, establish national defense, and strive to defend domestic peace and world peace.

　　庆祝英勇无敌的人民解放军二十三周年
    刘伯承
    我们英勇无敌的人民解放军今年八月一日满二十三岁了。在这时候，我们全国人民正坚决反对美帝国主义者武装侵略台湾、朝鲜，与一致执行毛主席的指示：为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争。
    自一九二七年八月一日中国人民解放军诞生那一天起，就是我们武装人民开始了反对武装反革命的英勇斗争，并在二十三年来不断的斗争中写下了不断地战胜反革命的光荣历史。在国共合作的大革命时期，正当革命的紧急关头，以蒋介石为首的国民党集团背叛了革命，把指向敌人——封建主义、帝国主义的刀锋掉转头来屠杀人民。但中国共产党和中国人民并未被他们骇倒，又由地下爬起来，继续对敌人作英勇的斗争。而那时我军在南昌起义的，不过三万人而已。
    从“八一”那天起，经过土地革命战争、抗日战争与人民解放战争三个时期，中国人民解放军经历了二十三年的光荣历史道路。
    在土地革命时期，当时我军也不过六万人，分头建立了根据地，而蒋介石曾以巨大兵力，四次围剿均告失败。我军为了抗日，又突破了五次围剿，胜利地进行了二万五千里长征，到达了抗日前线。
    在抗日战争之初，我们八路军、新四军也不过五万多人，深入华北、华中敌后作战，那时，汪精卫的军队打起有黄带子的青天白日满地红的旗子，在日寇指挥下对我们作战；而蒋介石则躲在西南一隅消极抗战，并几次发动反共反人民的高潮，使我们在敌后作战感到很大的困难。当时我军则密切结合着在敌后的广大人民，一致奋斗，打退了敌人屡次围剿，制止了几次反共高潮，创建了华北、华中、东北、华南等广大的解放区，实行了减租减息，发展了正规军约百万人，民兵二百余万人。
    在日寇投降后，蒋介石违反全国人民的和平愿望，在美国全力支援之下，发动了空前大规模的反革命内战。而我军则经过三年多的战争，越发壮大起来，打败了全部敌人，解放了西藏以外的全部大陆。
    不论在那一个时期，我军始终在毛主席与朱总司令领导下结合广大人民一致对敌，在反复的胜利斗争中，建立了根据地，而本身则由无到有，由小到大，由弱到强，终于在全国范围内战胜了敌人，而今只有台湾、西藏尚待解放。
    我们中国人民解放军之所以如此的英勇无敌，是因为他是在中国共产党前敌委员会领导之下诞生从此即未脱离党的领导。特别在井冈山会师以来，即统一于共产党代表政治委员毛泽东同志的领导，在毛泽东同志的领导下，进行了政治、军事、文化的教育，建立了新式的军事制度，进行了胜利的革命战争。由毛泽东同志一手培养出来的这样一支结合广大人民并为广大人民服务的军队，已由二十三年胜利的革命战争中表现它英勇无敌的威力。
    现在美国向朝鲜发动侵略战争，并悍然侵略台湾，我们必须从美国手中解放台湾，消灭蒋匪残余；并有责任保卫世界和平。
    我们要保持与发扬我军光荣的传统，要从陆军、海军、空军各方面把自己战斗力再提高一步，以达成解放台湾、西藏，建立国防，以保卫国内和平建设并为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
