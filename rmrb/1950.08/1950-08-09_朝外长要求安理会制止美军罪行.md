Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th:

　　Korean Democratic People’s Republic Foreign Minister Park Heon-yeong sent a telegram to UN Security Council President Malik on the 5th of this month, notifying the Security Council of the situation where the United States government, in violation of international law and humanitarian conventions, adopted inhumane combat methods in the war of aggression against Korea, and requesting the Security Council to take swift action to stop the crimes of the American interventionists in Korea.

　　The statement said: The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic has ample evidence to prove that the American aggressors, suffering repeated defeats from the heroic counterattacks of the People's Army and the entire Korean people, attempt to destroy the Korean people's will to resist foreign aggression by cruel methods, and have adopted cruel methods that violate international law and human moral conventions.

　　The statement pointed out: Since the beginning of the war, the US Air Force has been conducting barbarous bombing and strafing of cities and industrial areas in Korea that have no military targets or defenses, destroying residences, schools, hospitals and other cultural institutions, and killing peaceful residents. Taking Pyongyang as an example, from June 29th to August 2nd, American aircraft repeatedly bombed and strafed residential areas and residents within the city, destroying and damaging more than 2,200 houses. The People's Hospital and many school buildings were destroyed. Seven hundred citizens died and more than five hundred were injured. In July, the US Air Force repeatedly bombed Wonsan, dropping hundreds of tons of bombs, and repeatedly strafed with machine guns, destroying most of the city of Wonsan and killing or wounding more than 4,000 residents. US aircraft attacked Nampo several times, killing or wounding more than 400 residents of the city, and destroying more than 500 houses, public buildings, and cultural institutions. The city of Hungnam has been completely destroyed by successive US air raids. Residential areas in Seoul have been greatly damaged, with about 7,000 residents killed. Many small cities and villages in northern and southern Korea, with no military targets or industrial facilities, have also been bombed and strafed by US aircraft, many of which have been completely or almost completely destroyed.

　　After listing the US Air Force’s insane atrocities, the statement declared: All these atrocities are being carried out under the name of a so-called "police action" under the United Nations. The Korean people, like all upright people around the world, express extreme indignation at the barbaric acts of the American interventionists in Korea. The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic hereby notifies the Security Council of the above situation (the Korean Democratic People's Republic does not mention here the general issue of the illegality of the American intervention in Korea; regarding this issue, the government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic has stated its position in its statement to the UN Secretary-General on June 28, 1950), and lodges a strong protest, demanding that the Security Council take measures to swiftly stop the heinous crimes of the American armed forces in Korea.

　　The statement concluded: The government of the Korean Democratic People's Republic believes that if the Security Council refuses to take measures to stop American crimes, then the members of the Security Council who obstruct the taking of such measures should be jointly responsible for these crimes with the American interventionists.

　　朝外长要求安理会制止美军罪行
    【新华社平壤八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交部长朴宪永于本月五日致电联合国安全理事会主席马立克，通知安全理事会关于美国政府违反国际法与人道的常规，在侵略朝鲜的战争中采取惨无人道的作战手段的情形，并要求安理会迅速采取行动，制止美国干涉者在朝鲜的罪行。
    声明中称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府有充分的事实，证明遭受人民军与全体朝鲜人民英勇反击而连战连败的美国侵略者，妄图以残暴的方法，来摧毁朝鲜人民抵抗外国侵略者的意志，采用了违反国际法与人类道德常规的残暴方法。
    声明指出：美国空军自战争开始以来即在朝鲜对毫无军事目标和防备的城市、工业地区，进行野蛮的轰炸扫射，破坏住宅、学校、医院及其它文化机关并杀害和平居民。以平壤为例，自六月二十九日至八月二日，美国飞机反复轰炸扫射城内住宅区及居民，炸毁和破坏房屋在二千二百所以上。人民医院和许多学校的建筑，均被炸毁。市民死七百人，伤五百人以上。七月间，美空军机群连续轰炸元山，投弹数百吨，并屡次以机枪扫射，使元山城大部被毁，居民死伤四千余名。美机数次袭击南浦，该市居民伤亡四百多名，住宅、公共建筑及文化机关房屋五百余所被毁。兴南市在遭美机轮番轰炸下，已全部被破坏。汉城住宅区受到很大破坏，居民牺牲者在七千人左右。朝鲜南北部的许多毫无军事目标或工业设备的小城市与农村，同样受到美机的轰炸与射击，其中有许多已完全或几乎完全被毁。
    声明在列举美国空军的疯狂暴行之后声称：所有这一切暴行，都是在联合国的名义下进行的所谓“警察行动”。朝鲜人民如同全世界一切正直的人们一样，对于美国干涉者在朝鲜的野蛮行为，表示异常愤慨。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府兹特将上述情况通知安理会（朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在此姑不提美国干涉朝鲜之非法性的一般问题，关于此问题，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已于一九五○年六月二十八日致联合国秘书长的声明中，申明其立场。），并提出坚决抗议，要求安全理事会采取措施，迅速制止美国武装部队在朝鲜的滔天罪行。
    声明最后称：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府认为：如果安理会拒绝采取制止美国罪行的措施，那么，阻止采取此项措施的安理会理事国，应与美国干涉者对这些罪行，共同负责。
