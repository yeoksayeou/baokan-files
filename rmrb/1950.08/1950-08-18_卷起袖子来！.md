　　Roll Up Your Sleeves!
    By G. Lyukelin
    Seeing the way the American newspapers reported the American intervention in Korea, I was reminded of a man I once knew. This fellow was an overbearing bully who liked to boast about his physique to scare people. Listening to him, you might think he was incredibly strong. When he talked about his violent acts, this guy was smug and talked with spittle flying. What he boasted about was always like this:
    "Of course, I immediately rolled up my sleeves and jumped into the fray..."
    After a pause: "...and got slapped in the face."
    Perhaps MacArthur Headquarters will describe the situation on the Korean battlefield in the next communiqué in equally pleasant terms:
    "Of course, we immediately rolled up our sleeves..."
    As for what follows, you can guess:
    "...and got slapped in the face."
    These cold war strategists, propaganda tacticians, arrogant generals, and those outwardly strong but inwardly weak presidents, all, individually or collectively, flaunt their power, their prestige, atomic muscles, and super-atomic fists in order to intimidate progressive people.
    Military aid is permitted and easy victories are guaranteed to all those who are prepared to participate in international plunder and all anti-people rulers.
    Recently, Truman's generals boasted greatly about the strong army they had established for Syngman Rhee – this authentic waste product trained by the Americans!
    Some American newspaper reporters rudely pointed out that the Syngman Rhee gang had learned a lot from their instructors from across the ocean. The retreat of the puppet "government" troops was indeed an extraordinary retreat, in fact, a retreat "akin to a rout."
    United Press correspondent Miller, stationed at the U.S. military headquarters in Korea, reported that the South Korean army's retreat from Suwon "could simply be called a 'collapse,'" with the entire South Korean army scrambling for their lives in a panic.
    This report is not merely the unbiased opinion of an irrelevant bystander, but rather the opinions of many experts.
    However, we all know that imitations can never compare to the original. Syngman Rhee's lackeys are no match for the American military advisors. They still need to learn from the American advisors the art of running away from the battlefield.
    Talk about American prestige!
    American prestige is collapsing. The American army is no exception.
    News agency reports say that many American military "advisors" only made it across the Han River by swimming.
    A United Press dispatch from Daejeon stated that approximately two hundred and eighty American advisors arrived in Daejeon this morning after a ten-hour retreat from Suwon, and they were already "soaked to the skin and exhausted."
    Ms. Higgins, a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, said shyly that the people of the American military mission abandoned all their personal baggage and fled Seoul.
    As is well known, MacArthur's "intelligence officer," Colonel Echols, once condemned American reporters for reporting that American officials had abandoned their personal baggage. Afterwards, a United Press reporter, in his description of the retreat from Suwon, said triumphantly that American officials arrived in Daejeon "wearing their original clothes" – in other words, they did not lose anything along the way.
    When the Americans fled Suwon, there was no imminent danger there. But in a panic, this group of Americans set fire to their own headquarters. United Press reported that American authorities would conduct an investigation to determine who should be held responsible for this embarrassing retreat.
    In our view, things couldn't be clearer: the person who ordered the piratical attack should be held responsible for the retreat.
    And the attack was such a failure that even Senator Taft decided to blame Truman for overstepping his authority.
    Taft said in the Senate: "I think it is appropriate and necessary now to discuss the limits of the president's past actions." He also said: "Undoubtedly, the president's actions have resulted in a de facto war against the North Korean government."
    Taft's statement speaks more eloquently about the situation in Korea than all of MacArthur's communiqués.
    In short, the situation is this: MacArthur, Church, Dean, and other American warmongers have rolled up their sleeves and jumped into this fray...
    They are getting slapped in the face.

### 卷起袖子来！

　　卷起袖子来！
    Ｇ·吕克林作
    看到美国报纸所报导的美国对干涉朝鲜所采取的方式，我想起我曾经见过的一个人。这家伙是一个大言凌人的暴汉，他很喜欢吹嘘自己的体格，借以吓人。听他的口气，你也许会以为他的体力很了不起。当他讲起自己那些狂暴行为的时候，这家伙便洋洋自得，说得口沫乱飞。他所吹嘘的那一套总是这样：
    “当然，我马上卷起袖子，投身到混战里去……”
    停了一会儿：“……挨了一下耳光”。
    也许麦克阿瑟总部在下一个公报中会以同样好听的字句来描绘美国在朝鲜战场上的情况：
    “当然，我们马上就把袖子挽起来……”
    至于下文如何你是可以猜到的：
    “……挨了一下耳光。”
    这些冷战战略家、宣传战术家、傲慢的将军们以及那些外强中干的总统们，全部或者个别地在煊耀着他们的力量、他们的威势、原子肌肉和超级原子拳头，以便恫吓进步的人们。
    对于所有那些准备参预国际掠夺的人们以及一切反人民的统治者们，他们都允许给予军事援助，并保证轻易的胜利。
    最近杜鲁门的将军们曾大事夸耀他们为李承晚所树立起来的那支强有力的军队——这美国训练出来的地道的废物！
    有些美国报纸的记者粗鲁地指出：李承晚匪帮已经从来自大洋彼岸的教官那里学得了很多的东西。傀儡“政府”军队的撤退确是一种不同凡响的撤退，事实上是一种“类乎狼狈逃窜”的撤退。
    合众社驻朝鲜美军司令部记者密勒报导，说南朝鲜军队自水原的撤退“简直可以称为一种‘溃散’”，整个的南朝鲜军队都争先恐后地狼狈逃命。
    这个报导并非仅仅是一个毫不相关的旁观者的无偏见的言论，而且是许多专家们的意见。
    但是，我们都晓得，仿造出来的东西怎么也比不上原来的东西。比起美国军事顾问们来，李承晚的喽罗们是望尘莫及的。他们还需要向美国顾问们学习如何从战场上溜之大吉的艺术。
    谈谈美国的威信吧！
    美国的威信正在崩溃。美国军队也不能例外。
    通讯社的报导说，许多美国军事“顾问”们只是泅水才渡到了汉江的彼岸。
    一则发自大田的合众社消息说，约有二百八十名美国顾问在从水原作了十小时的撤退以后，于今晨抵达大田，他们已经是“有如落汤鸡，疲惫不堪了。”
    纽约先锋论坛报记者赫金斯女士曾羞怯地说道：美国军事使团的人们遗弃了一切私人行囊，逃出汉城。
    如众周知，麦克阿瑟的“情报官”艾克尔斯上校曾经谴责过美国记者们，因为他们曾报道过美国官员们丢弃了他们的私人行囊。事后，一个合众社记者在他描述自水原撤退的情况时，曾经很得意洋洋地说：美国官员们“穿着原来的衣服”到达大田——换句话说，他们在沿途并没有丢掉任何一件东西。
    当美国人自水原逃出的时候，那里并没有面临紧迫的危险。可是在惊慌失措中，这群美国人纵火烧毁了自己的司令部。合众社消息说美国当局将要进行调查，查明究竟谁该负这次狼狈撤退的责任。
    在我们看来，事情再明显也没有了：命令海盗式进攻的那个人应该负撤退的责任。
    而进攻却是如此的失利，甚至连参议员塔虎脱也决定来责难杜鲁门的越权了。
    塔虎脱曾在参议院中说：“我认为现在来讨论总统过去行动的权限是适当的，而且也是必要的。”他又说：“无疑地，总统的行为已经招致对北朝鲜政府的事实上的战争。”
    塔虎脱既然如此说法，这就比麦克阿瑟所发表的一切公报更雄辩地说明了朝鲜的形势。
    简而言之，形势就是这样；麦克阿瑟、邱奇、迪安以及其他美国战争贩子们，已经卷起了他们的袖子，投身到这个混战中去……
    他们正挨着耳光。
