　　Self-Criticism of My Bureaucratic Work Style
    Du Wenhua, Magistrate of Jingxing County, Hebei Province
    I was transferred to Jingxing County as magistrate at the beginning of the summer grain collection (formerly the deputy secretary of the Jingxing County Party Committee). During this summer grain collection, due to my serious bureaucratic work style, many problems arose. In order to deeply understand the root causes of these problems and effectively improve future work, I am willing to publish my preliminary self-criticism in front of the masses, so as to get help from the masses and enable me to better recognize and overcome my bureaucratic work style in this rectification movement.
    The most important problem is that I did not grasp the accurate acreage of wheat fields in this summer grain collection. According to the autumn statistics, a total of 267,626 mu of wheat were planted in the county. After the adjustment of administrative divisions last year, the nine districts of the county were divided into six districts, and the original fourth district (mining area) was placed under the jurisdiction of Shijiazhuang City. At this time, the county government was unclear about the acreage of wheat fields in the whole county. In May of this year, as the wheat collection approached, the county government instructed each district to quickly investigate the acreage of wheat fields. The result of the investigation was 181,771.6 mu. The county did not consider it carefully, and only thought that the figure was too small and not realistic, so it ordered each district to re-investigate. The county government reported to the special commissioner's office based on last year's statistics, estimating that the total acreage of wheat planted in the county was 237,254.4 mu. It was not until June 15, when the special commissioner's office held a collection meeting, that it was clarified that the acreage of wheat planted in the mining area was 53,883 mu. In this way, the county over-reported 23,511.4 mu. At that time, I did not correct the acreage in time, and mistakenly accepted the collection task according to the original self-reported number. When assigning tasks to districts and villages, I had to allocate acreage and tasks based on the estimated figures, which led to deviations from reality, violations of policies, and unreasonable burdens on the masses. For example, in Dawangmiao, the second district, there were only 136 mu of wheat fields, but the county estimated 196 mu. In Jinggou Village, there were 135 mu of wheat fields, but the county estimated 306 mu. According to the investigation of only sixteen villages, the actual wheat field acreage was nearly 3,000 mu.
    In addition, in the acreage of wheat planted in each village, the actual acreage burdened was reduced after deducting the reduction and exemption for poor, widowed, and veteran soldiers' families, and the elderly living alone, as well as those who could not afford the burden due to the large population and small land area. This point was not fully estimated beforehand, and as a result, there were deviations in the allocation. For example, in Shiqiaotou, the first district, the whole village planted 618 mu of wheat. According to the harvest, 14.6 percent should be collected, and 6,502 jin of wheat should be collected; however, the village only had 178 burdened mu for the whole year, and the average burden per burdened mu was more than 36 jin in the wheat season alone, which is obviously unreasonable. There were thirteen villages like this in the first district, and eight villages in the second district where each burdened mu exceeded 20 jin, and there were similar situations in other districts as well.
    Due to my bureaucratic work style, this summer grain collection has seriously deviated from the masses and reality. In order to match the acreage of wheat fields allocated by the county, the districts and villages repeatedly registered the wheat fields, which not only wasted a lot of manpower, but also affected the in-depth implementation of the summer grain collection policy and the timely completion of the task. The most serious thing is that it caused a lot of dissatisfaction among the masses, who believe that this year's summer grain collection is not to reduce the burden on the people, but to increase it. (Editor's note: The burden on some of the masses has indeed been increased.)
    After my own preliminary examination, the reasons for these deviations are mainly: (1) Our work is not thorough enough and lacks the necessary foresight. Because the acreage of wheat fields must be used in the wheat collection, we did not clarify it in time after the adjustment of administrative divisions, and only responded hastily when the summer grain collection was approaching. (2) I neither investigated and studied the acreage of wheat fields to grasp the actual situation, nor did I trust the figures investigated by each district, and I even groundlessly asked the lower levels to meet the county's estimates, saying: "The figures are not realistic, and a new investigation is needed." As a result, many district and village cadres had to make subjective estimates in order to match the acreage allocated by the county. (3) There is a simple task-oriented view, and the consistency of being responsible to the higher authorities and being responsible to the masses is not grasped, and the problem is not handled in a realistic manner. The acreage of wheat fields investigated by each district was always said to be "untrue." In the end, when the first district increased the acreage of wheat fields to 51,517.5 mu (accounting for about 60 percent of the total cultivated land area), the county was satisfied and thought that "the investigation in the first district this time is close to reality."
    Of course, the emergence of this serious deviation is greatly related to the lack of in-depth work by the Finance Section of the county government, but I must bear the main responsibility in the leadership. I am determined to take this issue as one of the main contents of the self-criticism in this rectification movement, so as to further recognize the mistakes and find out ways to improve. In addition, I will also lead all the cadres of the county government to seriously study the rectification documents, deeply examine bureaucracy and commandism, strengthen the mass viewpoint, and establish a new work style, so as to better serve the people.

### 检讨我的官僚主义作风

　　检讨我的官僚主义作风
    河北井陉县长  杜文华
    我是在夏征开始时被调任为井陉县长的（原任井陉县委副书记），在这次夏征工作中，由于我的严重的官僚主义作风，所以出了不少毛病。为了深刻认识发生这些毛病的根源，和有效地改进今后工作，我愿将我的初步检查公布在群众面前，以便得到群众帮助，使我能在这次整风运动中，更好的认识和克服自己的官僚主义作风。
    最主要的问题是在这次夏征中我没有掌握确实的麦田亩数。去秋统计，全县共种麦二十六万七千六百二十六亩。去年调整区划后，全县九个区划为六个区，原四区（矿区）划归石家庄市管辖。这时县府对全县的麦田亩数就弄不清了。今年五月，因麦征将到，县政府便指令各区赶快调查麦田亩数。调查结果为一十八万一千七百七十一亩六分。县里不加考虑，只认为数字太小，不切合实际，于是又令各区重新调查。县政府上报专署就根据去年的统计，估计全县种麦亩数为二十三万七千二百五十四亩四分。直到六月十五日，专署征收会议开始时，才弄清矿区种麦亩数是五万三千八百八十三亩。这样全县就多报了两万三千五百一十一亩四分。当时我没有及时更正亩数，就错误地按原来自报数接受了征收任务。向区、村布置时，只好仍以估计的数字分配亩数与任务，因此产生了脱离实际，违反政策，造成群众负担不合理的偏向。如二区大王庙只有一百三十六亩麦田，县里却估计一百九十六亩。井沟村一百三十五亩麦田，县里估计为三百零六亩。仅据十六个村调查，就超出实种麦田近三千亩。
    另外，各村种麦亩数中，除去贫苦烈军工属和孤老户的减免，以及因人多地少负担不着的以外，实际负担亩数便减少了。这一点事前没有估计周到，结果在分配上也出了偏差。如一区石桥头全村种麦六百一十八亩，根据年成按百分之十四点六征收，应征麦六千五百零二斤；可是该村全年只有负担亩一百七十八个，仅麦季征收每个负担亩平均负担已到三十六斤以上，很明显的这是不合乎情理的。一区类似这样的有十三个村，二区每个负担亩超过二十斤的也有八个村，其他区同样也有这类情形。
    由于自己工作中的官僚主义作风，造成这次夏征中严重脱离群众、脱离实际的偏向。区、村为了碰对县分配的麦田数，反复进行麦田登记，不但浪费很多人力，并影响夏征政策的深入贯彻，与任务的如期完成。最严重的是引起好多群众不满，认为今年夏征并不是减轻民负，而是加重民负。（编者按：有一部分群众也确实被加重了负担。）
    产生这些偏向的原因，经我自己初步检查后，认为主要是：（一）我们平素工作不深入，缺乏应有的预见性。因为麦田亩数在麦征中是一定要用的，调整区划后却没有及时弄清，直到夏征临近，才仓慌应战。（二）自己对麦田亩数既未调查研究掌握实际情况，又不信任各区调查的数字，竟毫无根据地要求下级适合县里的估计说：“数字不实际，要重新调查。”结果使好多区村干部为凑合县里分配的亩数，也不得不去作主观的估计。（三）存在着单纯任务观点，没有掌握对上负责和对群众负责的一致性，不去实事求是的处理问题。对各区调查的麦田亩数总是说“不真实”，最后一区将麦田亩数增到五万一千五百一十七亩五分（占总耕地面积约百分之六十）时，县里才满意的认为“一区这次调查接近实际。”
    当然，这一严重偏向的产生和县府财政科的工作不深入是有很大关系的，但在领导上我是要负主要责任的。我决心在此次整风运动中将这一问题作为检查的主要内容之一，以便进一步的认识错误，找出改进办法。此外，并要领导县政府全体干部认真学习整风文件，深刻检查官僚主义、命令主义，加强群众观点，树立新的工作作风，以便更好的为人民服务。
