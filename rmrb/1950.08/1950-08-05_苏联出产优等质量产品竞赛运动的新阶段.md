    New Stage in the Soviet Competition for High-Quality Products
    Li He
    More than a year ago, Zhutkik, a deputy foreman at the "Red Hills" plush factory in Moscow, initiated a competition for the production of high-quality products. Workers in factories, mines, machine and tractor stations, and other production sectors all over the Soviet Union were swept up in this movement like a tide. In the light industry sector alone, 50,000 production teams and units participated in the competition to produce high-quality products. Now, "high-quality production teams" can be found everywhere in factories and mines. They do not produce substandard products, only high-quality ones, thereby saving and accumulating a large amount of raw materials, materials, and funds for the country.
    The collective production of high-quality products and the collective avoidance of substandard products by entire production teams, entire workshops, entire factories, and entire enterprises are the characteristics of the Zhutkik movement. When we first heard about this movement, we always thought that only a part or even most of the workers in a certain production department were producing high-quality products, and that they could only generally avoid producing substandard products. However, the Soviet workers who have become the masters of society and who have mastered advanced technology have proven through their own practice that entire factories or entire enterprises can completely avoid producing substandard products and only produce high-quality products. For example, 99.72% of the finished products of the Obukhov woolen factory are first-class wool, only 0.28% are second-class, and there are no substandard products at all. The experience of advanced Soviet enterprises tells us that as long as all the workers in an enterprise are mobilized to participate in this competition, and the efforts of the competitors are properly organized and receive technical assistance, the entire enterprise can achieve the complete production of high-quality products.
    Producing high-quality products and reducing or completely eliminating substandard products is in itself an active form of conservation. Producing high-quality products does not require the expenditure of particularly more raw materials, materials, fuel, or tools. The female worker Rozhneva, who participated in the Soviet delegation to China in May, and another female worker, Konorenko, were the initiators of the competition to save raw materials, materials, fuel, and tools while producing high-quality products. This competition saved nearly 1,000 tons of raw wool for various enterprises in the wool textile industry last year, and produced millions of meters of textiles, hundreds of thousands of pairs of shoes, and many machines for the country. In March of this year, female shoe worker Korabelnikova and her production team further promoted joint conservation, while still producing high-quality products.
    The movement to produce high-quality products has written a glorious page in the history of the socialist competition movement in the Soviet Union after the war. However, the advanced Stakhanovite workers are not complacent about this. Zhutkik put forward a new suggestion on "How to go further" in the Labor Daily on April 28. He said that thousands of production teams have received the title of "High-Quality Production Team," and all their products are first-class. In addition to consolidating their original achievements and never producing substandard products, they can further increase labor productivity and make fuller use of raw materials, materials, and machinery. However, it would be wrong to think that the quality of products has reached its peak and that all possibilities have been exhausted. Zhutkik said, "There are many more possibilities. As long as we treat our work with a spirit of self-criticism, we can discover these possibilities."
    Zhutkik's suggestions include two main points: first, revise outdated standards. He said that the current standards allow for fifteen very small defects per thirty meters of first-class textiles—defects that even ordinary people cannot see. He believes that it is not only possible but also necessary to reduce these small defects. Some standards were established earlier, but now factories have new technical equipment, workers' skills have improved, and work processes have also improved. If the standards are not revised, the quality cannot be improved. Second, absorb all departments and personnel of the entire enterprise and the entire factory to participate in the competition without exception.
    Zhutkik is a representative of the Moscow Soviet. He often visits factories. He noticed that the fewest high-quality production teams are in the material preparation workshops of various factories because trade unions often only pay attention to the main workshops. However, he believes that the material preparation workshop is like the kitchen of the factory, and if its work is not done well, it cannot be corrected later. Zhutkik also often visits shops. Once, he found a pile of printed fabrics that were of good quality, but no one cared about them because the patterns were not beautiful. Therefore, he believes that not only workers, foremen, technicians, and engineers should be absorbed to participate in the competition, but also everyone from the pattern designers to the product inspectors should be absorbed to participate in the competition. He said that technical inspectors should not only check the quality of products, but also work with Stakhanovite workers to find ways to prevent defects from occurring.
    Zhutkik's suggestions have received active support from the Soviet Ministry of Light Industry and the Central Committee of the Light Industry Trade Union. They are studying the new conditions that those who have won the titles of High-Quality Production Team, High-Quality Workshop Section, High-Quality Workshop, and High-Quality Enterprise should meet, and are re-examining outdated standards and transforming the work of the technical inspection departments. The Ministry of Machine Tool Manufacturing Industry, the Ministry of Forestry, and the Ministry of Paper are all adopting Zhutkik's suggestions.
    Stakhanovite workers have also begun to support Zhutkik's suggestions. According to the Labor Daily on June 10, workers at the "Red Triangle" rubber shoe factory in Leningrad enthusiastically discussed Zhutkik's suggestions, revised outdated standards, and began a competition to improve the suitability and durability of rubber shoes. A workshop in the Yaroslavl "Northbound" shoe factory produced men's leather shoes that were made of good materials and were very strong, but the appearance was ugly and outdated, so the sales volume was very small. Therefore, the workers in the workshop requested that good designs should also be made when manufacturing cheap leather shoes. The leader of the High-Quality Production Team of the Kuibyshev Fourth Sewing Factory proposed to absorb more engineers and technicians to participate in the competition to improve quality, so that the machine would have fewer failures, which could greatly reduce the waste of finished products being returned for modification due to small defects. The machine component assembly workshop of the Voroshilov Locomotive Factory, which was the first workshop in the factory to win the title of Stakhanovite Workshop, is now responding to Zhutkik's call to strive for the title of High-Quality Workshop. After seeing Zhutkik's suggestion, the technical inspectors there also introduced their experience. They originally received the products from the foreman to check after the workers got off work, so they could not eliminate the defects of the products in time. Later, the inspection work was rectified. Starting from the first product made by the workers, the inspectors immediately told the workers the defects they found, thus immediately eliminating the defects. At the same time, the inspectors also checked whether each worker was using the technology correctly during the work process, taught the workers to understand the technology, understand the charts, and learn to use measuring machines. These two methods have fundamentally improved the quality of products.
    As the Labor Daily editorial pointed out: The importance of Zhutkik's suggestion is inestimable, and it marks the beginning of a new stage in the socialist competition for producing high-quality products. [Xinhua News Agency]

### 苏联出产优等质量产品竞赛运动的新阶段

　　苏联出产优等质量产品竞赛运动的新阶段
    李何
    一年多以前，莫斯科“红色丘陵”毛绒工厂副领班朱特基克发起了出产优等质量产品的竞赛运动。全苏各地工厂、矿山、机器与拖拉机站等生产部门的工人，都像狂潮一样地卷入了这一运动，仅仅轻工业部门，就有五万生产组和生产单位参加了出产优等质量产品的竞赛。现在在工厂中，在矿山里，到处都有“优等质量生产组”。它们不出产不合格的产品，只出产优等质量的产品，因而替国家节省和积蓄了大量的原料、材料和资金。
    整个生产组、整个车间、整个工厂、整个企业，集体出产优等质量的产品，集体不出产不合格的产品，这是朱特基克运动的特色。我们以前听到这一运动的时候，总以为出产优等质量产品的，只是一定生产部门的一部分或甚至大部分的工人，而且总以为他们只能一般地不出产不合格的产品。然而，成为社会的主人的苏联工人，掌握了先进技术的苏联工人，却以自己的实践证明：整个工厂或整个企业，是可以全部不出产不合格的产品，只出产优等质量的产品的。例如，奥布贺夫呢绒工厂的制成品中，百分之九十九点七二是头等呢绒，只有百分之○点二八是二等的，不合格的产品则完全没有。苏联先进企业的经验告诉我们：只要整个企业的工人都动员起来参加这一竞赛，而且竞赛者的努力经过必要的组织并得到技术上的协助，那么，整个企业就能够做到完全出产优等质量的产品。
    出产优等质量的产品，减少或者完全不出产不合格的产品，本身就是积极性的节约。在生产优等质量产品的时候，并不需要耗费特别多的原料、材料、燃料、工具。五月间参加苏联代表团到过中国的女职工罗日聂娃，和另一女职工柯诺连科，就是在出产优等质量产品的同时，在原料、材料、燃料、工具各方面也进行节约的竞赛运动的发起人。这一竞赛运动去年为毛织工业各企业节省了近千吨的原毛，替国家额外多生产了几百万公尺的纺织品，几十万双鞋和许许多多的机器。今年三月间女鞋工科拉贝尔尼科娃和她的生产组，又进一步提倡联合节约，出产的仍然是优等质量的产品。
    出产优等质量产品的运动，在苏联战后社会主义竞赛运动史中写下了辉煌的一页。可是，先进的斯塔哈诺夫式工作者并没有以此自满。朱特基克于四月二十八日在劳动报上提出了“如何再进一步”的新建议。他说：好几千个生产组都得到了“优等质量生产组”的称号，它们的全部产品都是头等的。它们除了巩固原有的成绩，绝不出产不合格的产品之外，还可以进一步提高劳动生产率，和更充分地利用原料、材料和机器装备。但是，如果有人认为在产品的质量问题上已经达到了顶点，已经发挥了一切可能，那便是错误的。朱特基克说：“可能性还多着哩。只要以自我批评的精神对待自己的工作，就可以发现这种可能性。”
    朱特基克的建议包括两个主要内容：第一，改订过时的标准。他说：现行的标准允许每三十公尺的头等纺织品有十五个很小的毛病——有时普通人都看不见的毛病。他认为不仅可以，而且应当减少这些小毛病。有些标准是早先规定的，但现在工厂已有了新的技术装备，工人的技能提高了，劳作过程也改善了，如果不改订标准，就不能改善质量。第二，吸收整个企业整个工厂的部门和人员无例外地参加竞赛。
    朱特基克是莫斯科苏维埃的代表。他常常访问各工厂。他注意到各工厂的准备材料车间中，优等质量生产组最少。因为工会往往只注意主要的车间。然而，他认为准备材料的车间，却如同工厂的厨房，如果它的工作作得不好，以后就无法改正。朱特基克也常常到商店去观光。有一次，他发现有一堆印花布，虽然质料很好，但是因为花样不美丽没有人过问。所以他认为不但要吸收工人、领班、技师、工程师参加竞赛，而且要把从图案设计者到检查产品的人员都吸收来参加竞赛。他说，技术检查员不但要检查产品的优劣，而且要和斯塔哈诺夫式工作者一起设法预防毛病的产生。
    朱特基克的建议，已得到苏联轻工业部和轻工业工会中央委员会积极的支持。它们正在研究那些赢得优等质量生产组、优等质量车间分部、优等质量车间、优等质量企业的称号者所应具备的新条件，并且重新研究过时的标准，改造技术检查部门的工作。母机制造工业部、林业部、造纸部都在采纳朱特基克的建议。
    斯塔哈诺夫式工作者也开始支持朱特基克的建议。据劳动报六月十日载称：列宁格勒“红三角”胶皮鞋工厂的工人们，热烈地讨论了朱特基克的建议，改订了过时的标准，开始了改进胶皮鞋的适用和耐穿的程度的竞赛。雅罗斯拉夫“北行”鞋厂有一个车间出产的男皮鞋，材料很好，也很结实，但样子难看而且过了时，以致销售量很少；因此，该车间的工人要求在制造便宜的皮鞋时也应当设计好的样子。古比雪夫第四缝纫厂优等质量生产组组长提议，多多吸收工程师、技师参加提高质量的竞赛，使得机器少发生毛病，就可以大大减少制成品因有小缺点而退回修改的浪费现象。伏罗希洛夫火车头制造厂的机件装配车间，是全厂第一个获得斯塔哈诺夫车间称号的，现在正响应朱特基克的号召，在争取优等质量车间的称号。那里的技术检查员看到了朱特基克的建议之后，也把自己的经验介绍出来。他们原来是在工人下工之后才从领班那里接收产品来检查的，因此不能及时消除产品的缺点。后来整顿了检查工作。检查员在工人上工制造头一件产品时起，就把发现的缺点立即告诉工人，因此立即消除了缺点。同时，检查员还检查每个工人在工作过程中是否正确地运用技术，教导工人了解技术，懂得图表，学会使用测量机器等。这两个办法起了根本改善产品质量的作用。
    正如劳动报社论所指出的：朱特基克的建议的重要性是难以估计的，它标志着出产优等质量产品的社会主义竞赛的新阶段之开端。【新华社讯】
