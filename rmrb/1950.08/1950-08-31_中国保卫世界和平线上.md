　　Workers in the Lushun-Dalian area are determined to defend world peace with their production achievements. Since the launch of the peace signature campaign, the work efficiency of the machinery section of the Dalian Electric Motor Factory in repairing transformers has tripled compared to before. Comrade Liu Enzhang now makes seventeen electrical shutdown parts a day, up from five previously. New achievements are constantly emerging in other factories as well.

Freight worker representative Lu Zhendong proposed to set a plan to save on wagons, exceeding the task by 20 percent. Transport worker representative Dong Guojun said: Thoroughly implement regulations to avoid any accidents to support the liberation of Taiwan. The workers are increasing their strength to defend world peace through planned production increases.

　　Bai Qingshan, an elementary school student from Dong Lengshui Village, Lincheng, Shandong Province, said after signing the Peace Declaration: "This spring, eight families in my village built new houses, and many others dug canals and repaired wells to turn dry land into paddy fields. Men and women are helping each other in labor cooperation, presenting a new picture of production and construction. Thinking back to the War of Resistance Against Japan in 1941-1942, the Japanese devils came to my village to seize laborers and grain. Under the Three Alls Policy, more than one-third of the houses in my village were destroyed by burning. The devils came every two or three days, and the people fled east and west, unable to produce properly. This led to the great famine in 1942, when the people had no food to eat and were emaciated, resulting in broken families and deaths. The situation was truly miserable. Later, the Soviet Union sent troops to the Northeast, and the devils surrendered. Then the Communist Party liberated our homes from the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek gang. Only then could we truly live a good life. Now, American imperialism is openly sending troops to invade Korea and obstructing our liberation of Taiwan, trying to provoke a third world war and not letting us live a good life. I feel very angry in my heart. I oppose wars of aggression. I hope that people all over the world can live peaceful and happy lives, so I want to sign the Peace Declaration."

Every night, when a large signature paper was unfolded under the bright gasoline lamp, everyone rushed to sign. Farmer Zhang Dexiao said: "We are pioneers in eliminating pests, and we must also be pioneers in signing the petition." In no time, the peace signature paper was filled with everyone's names, crooked and slanted.

I want to sign the petition!"

　　Yangdian Township, District Seven, Queshan, Henan, held a signature rally. At the meeting, Zhang Zhenzhong said: "This newly liberated area is much better than it was under the rule of old Chiang. Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism are both weasels carrying oil fruits, all the same kind of goods. Holding a peace signature campaign is to unite and stand on the same line with all those who support world peace. Imperialism is like a tiger with its teeth pulled out, unable to eat people."

In order to express our hatred for American imperialism and our love for world peace, we will go home and launch a signature campaign so that every villager can sign the Peace Declaration."

　　Zhang, an old lady in her sixties from Shihua District, Gucheng, Hubei, said with emotion: "Chiang Kai-shek has been making trouble for so many years that my two sons were taken away and my fields were abandoned. I don't know how many tears I shed and how much anger I suffered during those times. Finally, the Communist Party came, and the world was at peace. My sons have returned, and we are about to live a happy life, but who knew that American imperialism would come to start a war again? We absolutely cannot allow them to come and destroy us again."

　　Du Ling, a peasant woman from Huadi, Fangcun District, Guangzhou, had just returned from the fields.

She said: "American devils regard the atomic bomb as a treasure, but if we people are united, we are more powerful than any bomb."
