Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: TASS reported on the 19th, citing the Japanese newspaper "Democratic Youth": Three hundred and fifty representatives of the Japanese Youth Fatherland Front held a national conference under the following slogans: "We will not allow the atomic bomb to be dropped on our land again! Do not let the atomic bomb drop on Korea! Oppose war! Defend peace!"

According to figures released by the conference, as of August 5th, the Japanese Youth Fatherland Front had collected 739,218 signatures for the Stockholm Appeal.

The conference sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, protesting the United States' aggression against Korea under the banner of the United Nations. The telegram stated: "We hope that you will take a resolute stand to restore the United Nations banner to its proper position to safeguard peace, freedom, and democracy."

The participants of the conference passed a resolution on the Korean Civil War. The resolution particularly emphasized that "the forces led by the Soviet Union fighting for world peace are greatly expanding." The resolution also pointed out that "the imperialists are openly using Japan as a bridgehead to suppress the Korean people's war of liberation. They are adapting Japanese industry to war and forcing Japanese workers, especially young people, onto the path of slavery and death.

The Japanese Youth Fatherland Front, which unites four million patriotic young people, announced that it fully supports the Korean people's war of liberation for freedom, unification, independence, and democracy, and firmly opposes any country's interference in the Korean Civil War.

We resolutely protest against turning Japan into a war base, resolutely protest against the plans of American imperialism and the Yoshida puppet government that hope to turn the Japanese people, especially young people, into cannon fodder, turn Japan into a powder keg for a third world war, and attempt to revive Japanese militarism.

We must refuse to manufacture and transport weapons used to suppress the Korean people's liberation struggle and promote the victory of the Korean people's liberation struggle."
