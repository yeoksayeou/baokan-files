Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 19th: The Fourth Party Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of Henan Province has achieved good results in its rectification campaign, which focused on summarizing and reviewing the Party's urban and rural work this spring. This serves as a good start for the province-wide and Party-wide rectification campaign that is about to begin in Henan. The conference was convened by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and lasted for twenty-four days from July 5th to July 28th. Participants included all members of the Provincial Committee, secretaries of local committees, municipal committees, and county committees, as well as representatives of the Party committees above the regimental level of the Henan Military Region, and representatives of the Party from the Provincial People's Government, provincial people's organizations, and their directly affiliated organs.

The central task of the summary and review of the conference was the rent reduction and anti-despot work carried out throughout Henan Province this spring, as well as the land reform work carried out in about half of the region. The meeting held that the achievements of the work were significant, and all of these tasks were basically carried out in a guided and orderly manner. This was the result of the correct leadership of the higher-level Party committees, the unity of all Party members and non-Party cadres with the broad masses of people, and the arduous efforts of adhering to the Party's policies. The meeting pointed out that many Party cadres correctly implemented the Party's policies and government decrees in their work, correctly grasped the working steps and the methods of the mass line, thus making the work achieve the desired results. However, the land reform movement generally showed rough work due to the short time and urgent requirements. At the same time, some mistakes occurred in the work, such as incorrectly classifying some people's class components, and random arrests and detentions. Although random arrests and detentions did not cause confusion in the movement, they were still a relatively common and serious fact at the time. This was because the above investigations and research were insufficient, the starting point from the actual situation was insufficient, and the cadres still had remnants of "leftist" empiricism in their thinking, as well as commandism, formalism, and other ideological styles. Based on the summary and review of the work, the meeting read rectification documents, further investigated the situation, presented facts, conducted analysis and research, launched criticism and self-criticism, and made clear conclusions in order to improve the policy and ideological level of Party cadres and improve their work style.

Leading Cadres Take the Lead, Carry out Criticism and Self-Criticism

Criticism and self-criticism first unfolded from the self-criticism of leading cadres. The Henan Provincial Committee first admitted that the shortcomings and errors in the work should mainly be the responsibility of the Provincial Committee leadership: the Provincial Committee estimated the land reform work to be easier, and did not do enough to prevent and correct the deviations of cadres in their work in advance. The meeting then launched extensive criticism from checking work and checking work style. The meeting focused on discussing and correcting the "leftist" empiricist remnant thinking among cadres, and discussed and corrected the work style of commandism and formalism. The meeting unanimously held that the above-mentioned incorrect ideological work style was the direct cause of certain serious errors.

The purpose of the meeting was to use existing experience as a method to better complete the province's rural social reform work. Therefore, the second part of the meeting started with studying the Land Reform Law, and studied the specific issues, especially policy issues, of how to implement land reform in the other half of Henan this winter. After discussion, specific and clear regulations were made. The meeting emphasized that full preparation must be made before the implementation of land reform, especially rent reduction work must be done well. Therefore, the meeting decided that before the implementation of land reform this autumn, individual villages that have not done a good job of rent reduction must continue to reduce rent, and areas where rent reduction is not thorough must conduct a rent check. In discussing the policy of preserving the rich peasant economy, the meeting cleared the "leftist" ideological remnants among Party cadres that did not proceed from the current actual situation and actual needs. It also criticized the "leftist" thinking that had occurred in the past work, such as insufficient unity with the middle peasants, neglecting intellectuals, not taking care of the interests of tenant farmers, and not being good at working with democratic people to do a good job of land reform. In the discussion, combined with the situation in various parts of Henan, the correctness of the general policy and general line of land reform was further recognized, and the growth of right-leaning sentiments was prevented.

In the examination of the overall urban and rural work in Henan this spring, the meeting strictly criticized various forms of bureaucratism that occurred in the work, especially irresponsible bureaucratism and coercive command bureaucratism, so that the participants unanimously recognized the serious harm of bureaucratism to the work.

The gains of the twenty-four-day meeting were that the boundaries were initially clarified in policy and ideology, and the working methods and styles of investigation and research, proceeding from reality, linking with the masses, and having a leadership mass line were initially established in work style. At the end of the meeting, from the Provincial Committee to every participating cadre, everyone felt relaxed and happy, their minds were open, everyone initially established a humble and prudent attitude, and enhanced their confidence in completing future tasks.

　　中共河南省党代表会议
    总结城乡工作进行整风
    明确政策思想，树立群众路线工作作风，以更好地完成农村社会改革工作。
    【新华社开封十九日电】中共河南省第四次党代表会议以总结和检查今春党的城市工作和农村工作为主进行整风已获得良好的成绩，为河南正在开始的全省全党整风作了一个良好的开端。会议为中共河南省委员会所召集，自七月五日至二十八日共历二十四天，参加者除全体省委会委员、各地委会市委会和县委会书记外，还有河南军区部队团级以上的党委代表，以及省人民政府和省人民团体及其直属机关的党的代表。
    今春河南全省的减租和反恶霸工作，以及约一半地区的土地改革工作，是会议总结和检查的中心一项。会议认为工作成绩是很大的，而且所有这些工作，都基本上是在有领导有秩序的情况下进行的。这是上级党委领导正确，和全体党员和非党干部团结广大人民群众、坚持党的政策艰苦努力工作的结果。会议指出：不少党员干部在工作中正确地执行了党的政策和政府的法令，正确地掌握了工作步骤和群众路线的方法，因而使工作收到了预期的效果。但土地改革运动却一般因时间短要求急而出现了工作粗糙的现象，同时工作中曾发生一些错误，如划错了一些人的阶级成份，以及乱捕人扣人等。乱捕乱扣虽未引起运动的混乱，当时却仍是较普遍严重存在的事实。这是由于上面调查研究不够，从实际情况出发不够，由于干部思想上还存在“左”的经验主义残余，和命令主义、形式主义等思想作风的结果。会议根据对工作的总结和检查，阅读整风文件，并进一步查情况，摆事实，进行分析研究，展开批评和自我批评，作出明确的结论，以便提高党员干部的政策思想水平，改进工作作风。
    领导干部以身作则  开展批评自我批评
    批评和自我批评首先从领导干部的自我批评展开。河南省委首先承认：工作的缺点和错误主要应由省委领导负责：省委对土地改革工作估计得容易了些，对干部在工作中发生的偏差事先防止和及时纠正都不够。会议随即从查工作和查作风中开展了广泛的批评。会议集中地讨论了和纠正了干部中的“左”的经验主义残余思想，讨论了和纠正了命令主义与形式主义的作风。会议一致认为上述不正确的思想作风，更是造成某些严重错误的直接原因。
    会议的目的在于运用已有的经验作为方法，去更好地完成全省的农村社会改革工作。因此会议的第二个段落是从学习土地改革法入手，研究了今冬河南另一半地区如何实行土地改革的各项具体问题，特别是政策问题。经过讨论，作出了具体明确的规定。会议强调，实行土地改革以前一定要有充分的准备工作，特别是必须作好减租工作。因此，会议决定在今年秋后实行土地改革以前，尚未作好减租的个别乡村一定要继续减租，减租不彻底的地区要进行一次查减。在讨论保存富农经济的政策中，会议清算了党员干部中不从当前实际情况和实际需要出发的“左”的思想残余。也批判了过去工作中曾发生的团结中农不够，以及轻视知识分子，不照顾佃农利益，不善于与民主人士共同将土地改革工作做好等“左”的思想。讨论中，也结合河南各地情况进一步认识了土地改革总政策总路线的正确，防止了右的情绪的滋长。
    会议在对整个河南今春城乡工作的检查中，严格地批评了工作中发生的各种各样的官僚主义现象，特别是批评了不负责任的官僚主义和强迫命令的官僚主义，使与会者一致认识了官僚主义对工作的严重危害性。
    二十四天会议的收获，是在政策思想上初步划清了界线，在作风上也初步树立了调查研究的、从实际出发的、联系群众的有领导的群众路线的工作方法和作风。会议结束时，从省委到每一个与会干部，都感到轻松愉快，思想开朗，每一个人都初步建立了谦虚谨慎的态度，增强了完成今后任务的信心。
