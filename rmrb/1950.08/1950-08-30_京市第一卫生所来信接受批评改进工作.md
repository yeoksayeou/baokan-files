To the Editor:

Regarding the opinions expressed by Comrade Li Youlin of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Ministry of Health in the "People's Garden" on July 8th, titled "The First Health Clinic of Beijing Should Improve Maternal and Child Health Work," we consider them very valuable. We completely agree with three points mentioned therein, and we have already improved our work accordingly.

I.	Since the last work inspection, the practice of nurses placing paper under coats at the homes of postpartum women has been discontinued.

II.	The clinic has been paying for the transportation expenses for home visits since May of this year.

III.	Because many nursing students who come to our clinic for internships lack practical experience, they often use textbook terms when conducting health education for the masses, making it difficult for the masses to understand. We have noticed this problem and are working hard to improve it.

As for the issues of the appointment system for outpatient services and the pre-natal examination system, we have already submitted written reports to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Work Inspection Committee, requesting them to consider and review them. The following are our views on these two issues:

I.	The appointment system arose because many pregnant women requested prenatal check-ups at our clinic and asked our midwives to provide home delivery services, and we were unable to handle them all. This was a last resort. However, with the development of the maternal and child health network in this district, we have abolished this system since August 21st. All pregnant women who request delivery services from our clinic will receive prenatal check-ups. After the examination, they will be introduced to members of the health network for delivery.

II.	Regarding the "prenatal examination" system, we completely agree that we should not use "mandatory prenatal examination" as a condition for providing delivery services, but should start with health education. However, we believe that prenatal examination itself has great educational significance. Therefore, the existence of this system is still necessary.

When the First Health Clinic was first established, we adopted the method of providing delivery services to postpartum women as they arrived. Because there were very few people who understood modern midwifery at that time, prenatal check-ups were out of the question. After years of publicity, the number of pregnant women in Inner District 1 who voluntarily came for check-ups gradually increased. Therefore, this system was established in 1936. From 1947 until the eve of the liberation of Beijing, there were about eleven or twelve cases where people came to our clinic for delivery services when labor began, and we introduced them to Hongren Hospital, which was less than 30 yards away from our clinic. Since liberation, we have also introduced them to the Maternal and Child Health Center. Therefore, although our clinic has a "prenatal examination" system, we do not ignore those who come to us only when labor begins, but rather introduce them to other appropriate places.

In order to ensure that all pregnant women in Inner District 1 have the opportunity to receive modern delivery services, we established a maternal and child health network in March of this year. There are now 32 units participating in this health network, including public and private hospitals, as well as individual doctors and midwives. We work together with local police stations and women's organizations to promote the importance of maternal and child health (including prenatal examinations, modern delivery services, and infant vaccinations). When members of the health network encounter someone requesting delivery services but are unable to attend due to other work, they can introduce the pregnant woman to other members, so that the pregnant woman does not have to seek untrained personnel for delivery because she cannot find anyone. The Health Bureau has free services available for poor pregnant women. However, this free preferential treatment is also limited to those who have undergone prenatal examinations, the reason being to encourage pregnant women to have prenatal examinations.

In the past four months, the health network's business has gradually expanded, and more people have received modern delivery services. At the same time, we have strengthened our connection and publicity with the masses, and have organized business and political studies for our members. We hope that everyone will give us more criticism and guidance in the future so that we can do our work better.

### 京市第一卫生所来信接受批评改进工作

　　京市第一卫生所来信接受批评改进工作编辑同志：
    关于中央卫生部妇幼局李友林同志七月八日在人民园地发表的“京市第一卫生所应改进妇幼卫生工作”的意见，我们认为非常宝贵。其中三点，我们完全同意。我们并已改进了我们的工作。
    一、自从上次工作检查后，护士在产妇家放大衣要铺纸的习惯，即已取消。
    二、家庭访视的车钱，已于本年五月起由所方负担。
    三、由于来本所实习的护士学生多缺乏实际经验，在向群众进行卫生教育时，往往带着一些书本上的名词，致使群众难以了解。现在我们已注意到这个问题，并在亟力改善中。
    至于关于门诊预约制度和生产前检查制度的问题，我们已用书面反映给北京市人民政府工作检查委员会，请他们考虑和审核。下面便是我们对于这两问题的看法：
    一、预约制度的产生，是由于要求到我所作产前检查，并因为请我所助产士作家庭接生的孕妇很多，我们照顾不过来。这是不得已的办法。但现在随着本区妇幼保健网工作的发展，自八月二十一日起，我们已取消了这一制度。凡请求本所接生的孕妇，都予以产前检查，经检查后，介绍给保健网的组员去接生。
    二、关于“产前检查”制度的问题，我们固然完全同意不应拿“必须先作产前检查”来作接生的条件，而须从卫生教育着手。不过，我们却认为产前检查本身，原就含有很大的教育意义。故这一制度的存在，仍是有其必要的。
    在第一卫生所初创时，对于产妇原采取随到随接的办法。因那时懂得新法助产的人很少，谈不到产前检查。经过多年的宣传，内一区的孕妇自动来检查的已渐渐增多起来。故于一九三六年开始建立了这一制度。自一九四七年到北京解放前夕，临产时来我所请接生的，大约有十一、二起，我们都将其介绍到离本所不到三十码的宏仁医院。自解放后，我们亦都将其介绍到妇婴保健所。所以我所虽有“产前检查”制度，但对临产时才来找我们的人也并非不管，而是将她们介绍到别的妥当的地方。
    为了要使内一区所有的孕妇都有机会获得新法接生，在本年三月，我们成立了一个妇幼卫生保健网。现在加入这保健网组织的，共有三十二个单位，包括公私立医院和个人开业的医师和助产士。我们联合当地的派出所和妇女组织，一起宣传妇婴卫生的重要（其中包括产前检查、新法接生，和婴儿的预防接种）。凡是保健网的组员，遇到有人请求接生，而自己因别的工作不能分身的时候，即可将此产妇介绍给别的组员，使产妇不致因找不到人而去找未受训练的人接生。最近四个月中尚没有临产时才来请本所接生的人。以后若有，我们自己虽限于人力，不能去接，我们可将其介绍给别的组员。对于贫苦的孕妇，卫生局订有免费的办法。不过此项免费优待，也仅限于已作过产前检查的人，原因也是为了要鼓励孕妇们作产前检查。
    在这四个月的过程中，保健网的业务已渐渐扩大，得到新法接生的人也更增加了。同时，我们也加强了对群众的联系和宣传，并对我们的组员组织了业务和政治学习。今后希望大家多加批评和指导，使我们的工作能做得更好。
