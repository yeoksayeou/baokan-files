Xinhua News Agency, August 25th. The 47th session of the Central People's Government Administration Council was held at 3:30 PM on the 25th. The meeting began with reports by Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, Li Lisan, deputy head, Zhang Naiqi, secretary-general, and Xu Guangping, a member of the delegation, who had just returned from Korea after attending the "August 15th" Korean Liberation Celebration, on their experiences during the trip. In their reports, they unanimously pointed out that the Korean people received great encouragement from the support of the Chinese people. Since the US imperialists instigated the Syngman Rhee puppet regime to launch the war in June, the cruelty and inhumanity of the US imperialists' slaughter and bombing of the Korean people have surpassed even those of the Japanese fascists. However, the Korean people were not intimidated by this. Whether on the front lines or in the rear, whether in villages or cities, whether men or women, they all bravely stood up, united in hatred against the enemy, and valiantly resisted the aggression of the US imperialists, achieving continuous victories.

Following the reports, the meeting listened to Minister of Justice Shi Liang of the Central People's Government on the National Judicial Conference and discussed and approved the report. In addition, the meeting also passed several cases of appointments and removals and submitted appointment proposals to the Central People's Government Committee for approval.

　　政务院四十七次会议
    听取郭沫若等报告赴朝经过
    讨论和批准关于司法会议的报告
    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民政府政务院第四十七次政务会议于二十五日下午三时半举行。会议首由刚从朝鲜参加“八一五”朝鲜解放庆典归来的中国人民代表团团长郭沫若，副团长李立三，秘书长章乃器，团员许广平报告此行经过。他们在报告中一致指出朝鲜人民从中国人民的声援获得极大的鼓励。六月间美帝国主义嗾使李承晚傀儡政权发动战争以来，美帝国主义对于朝鲜人民的屠杀与轰炸，其残酷无人性，比起日本法西斯尤有过之而无不及。但朝鲜人民并未因此被吓倒。他们在前线，在后方，无论乡村或城市，男子或妇女，都勇敢地站立起来，同仇敌忾，奋勇地迎击着美帝国主义的侵略，并取得了不断胜利。
    会议继在听取了中央人民政府司法部史良部长关于全国司法会议的报告后，讨论和批准了该报告。此外，会议并通过任免及提请中央人民政府委员会批准任命案多起。
