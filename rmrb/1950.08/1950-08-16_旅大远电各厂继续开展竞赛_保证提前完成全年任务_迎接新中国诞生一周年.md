[Dalian News] The Dalian and Lüshun's Distant Electric Power Cement, Glass, Paint, Motor, Light Bulb, and other factories, following the "July 1st" competition, continue to launch competitions to complete the annual production tasks ahead of schedule in order to welcome the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Cement Factory proposed to complete and exceed 20% of the annual production task ahead of schedule by National Day on October 1st, while the Glass and Paint factories both aim to complete 105% of the annual production task by October 1st. At the start of the Glass Factory's competition, various slogans with production competition targets were posted in each workshop. They proposed that the competition should not only complete the annual task ahead of schedule, but also increase labor efficiency by 20% and reduce costs by 1%, so that first-class glass exceeds 50%. In addition, they also aim to save raw materials for 24 hours of use, preparing to use these raw materials for one day of production around October 1st. Under this general requirement, the workers of each department of the factory have been swept into a production upsurge. Workers in the plate-making department strictly abide by technical regulations and shift handover systems to ensure good glass quality; workers in the blending department, based on raw material consumption standards, and under the slogan of not wasting a single bit of raw material, can now save 80 to 90 catties of soda ash every day; the gas generator used to consume 72 tons of coal every day, but now can save two tons every day. With the efforts of the workers in each department, the daily production of the entire factory now exceeds the daily production plan by 40%, and the quality has been improved to the point where first-class glass accounts for 60%. In the Paint Factory, workshops compete with workshops, and departments compete with departments, in friendly competitions. Workshops that are interconnected, such as the barrel-making workshop and the paint workshop, and the repair department and the pigment team, have all signed liaison contracts. The Cement Factory workers demonstrated high enthusiasm for labor, creating an unprecedented record of 21,000 tons of cement in monthly production in June, and successfully completed the annual production task at 10:00 PM on August 5th.

　　旅大远电各厂继续开展竞赛
    保证提前完成全年任务  迎接新中国诞生一周年
    【大连讯】旅大远电洋灰、玻璃、油漆、电机、灯泡等厂，继“七一”竞赛之后，继续展开为迎接中华人民共和国诞生一周年提前完成全年生产任务的竞赛。洋灰工厂提出于十月一日国庆时，提前完成并超过全年生产任务的百分之二十，玻璃、油漆两厂都要在十月一日完成全年生产任务的百分之一百零五。玻璃工厂竞赛开始时，各车间就张贴出写着生产竞赛目标的各种标语，他们提出：竞赛中不但要提前完成全年任务，并且要提高劳动效率百分之二十，减低成本百分之一，使一等玻璃超过百分之五十。除此，并要节省二十四小时用的原料，准备在十月一日前后，以此原料进行一日生产。在这个总的要求下，该厂各部工人已卷入生产热潮中。制板部工人为使玻璃质量好，严格遵守技术规程与交班制度；调合部工人根据原料消耗标准，在不浪费一点原料的口号下，现在每天可省出八、九十斤曹达灰；瓦斯发生炉过去每天用七十二吨煤，现在每天可节省两吨。在各部工人的努力下，现全厂每日生产可超过当日生产计划的百分之四十，质量已提高到一等玻璃占百分之六十。油漆工厂职场与职场、科与科、都展开友谊竞赛。互相有联系的职场，如制筒对油漆职场，修理对颜料班，都签订了联系合同。洋灰工厂工人发挥了高度劳动热情，六月份创造出月产两万一千吨洋灰的空前最高纪录，并于八月五日下午十点胜利完成全年生产任务。
