　　Strive to Obtain Two Hundred Million Peace Signatures Nationwide
    In order to expand China's peace signature campaign, the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a notice to all national people's organizations on the 13th, calling on the people of the whole country to continue their efforts to obtain 150 million to 200 million signatures on the Stockholm Appeal. All people's organizations have responded to this call, expressing their determination to work to achieve this glorious task.
    China's peace signature campaign has been underway for more than three months. Thanks to the efforts of peace fighters across the country, nearly 60 million people nationwide have now signed the World Peace Council's peace declaration. Currently, there are more than 280 million peace signatories worldwide, with China's signature count accounting for more than one-fifth of this number. However, we must not be satisfied with the current achievements. If we compare our country's existing signature figures with China's total population, we will realize that this number is not yet large. The Soviet Union and many people's democratic countries have taken the lead in this regard. The Soviet Union's population is 200 million, but the number of signatures in the Soviet Union has already exceeded 115 million. The number of signatures in countries such as Korea, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria are all around 80 percent of the national population. We should strive to emulate these fraternal countries.
    The current task is to turn the peace signature campaign into a widespread mass movement in small and medium-sized cities and in rural areas. The signature work in some areas has been carried out better. For example, the number of signatures in the Northeast region has approached half of the region's population, and the number of signatures in Shanghai and Chongqing has reached more than 80 percent of the population, while the number of signatures in Beijing, Tianjin and other places has also exceeded 50 percent of the population. However, the signature work in most areas is still weak. Now we should promote the experience of advanced regions to these places. China's actual population is about 500 million, and 200 million signatories only account for 40 percent of the total population. Therefore, achieving the goal of 200 million signatures is not difficult.
    In the peace signature campaign, it is necessary to carry out sufficient propaganda and mobilization work. There can be various ways to carry out propaganda and mobilization. But no matter what method is used, there must be a certain number of personnel responsible for the propaganda work. Wherever a signature campaign is conducted, it is best to first collect a group of propagandists to serve the signature campaign. Members of all democratic parties, members of all people's organizations, especially members of farmers' associations, Young Pioneer members, members of the Youth League, students and teachers in schools, political workers in the army, and all kinds of artists can serve as such propagandists. They can collect signatures on the streets, at markets, and in meetings, or they can go door-to-door to conduct family visits, seeking the signatures of all men, women, old, and young on the peace declaration. Every propagandist should prepare touching propaganda materials and propaganda skills, and strive to obtain hundreds and thousands of signatures on the peace declaration. Zhang Liping, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation, collected 2,200 signatures on the peace declaration through selfless work. Zhang Liping's example should be a model for all peace fighters in their work. If we have hundreds of thousands or millions of such peace fighters, such propagandists, our country's organization and consolidation will be greatly improved, and we will be invincible on the propaganda front.
    Newspapers should carry out enthusiastic work for the peace signature campaign. In the past, many newspapers have done work in this area, but most newspapers have not done a satisfactory job, and should be strengthened in the future. Newspapers should regularly report on the situation of the local peace signature campaign in prominent positions and with vivid language, and introduce the successful experiences and exemplary cases of the signature campaign. Newspapers should be responsible for explaining the significance of the peace signature campaign to readers, and answering various questions raised by readers in the peace signature campaign. Only in this way can our signature movement become a vigorous national movement.
    The people of the whole country should realize that the peace signature campaign is not only a signature campaign, but also an unparalleled political lesson for the people of our country, and an unprecedented great review and great demonstration of the strength of the people of our country. Because American imperialism is stepping up its implementation of its aggression plan, because our neighbor Korea and our territory Taiwan have suffered armed aggression from the United States, the people of our country must intensify the struggle against aggression. Defending world peace means defending the lives and property of every Chinese person. American imperialism is working hard to push the world onto the road to war. The current task of the people of the world is to smash the aggression plan of American imperialism. The Korean people have already dealt a serious blow to the war adventures of American imperialism with their heroic struggle. The heroic struggle of the Korean people, coupled with the anti-aggression struggle of the people of the world with the 800 million people of the Soviet Union, China, and Eastern Europe as the backbone, is fully capable of defeating the imperialist warmongers. This truth must become common knowledge in every family in every remote corner of China. Yes, there are still some people who do not fully understand this truth, who are skeptical, and they can become "air raid shelters" for imperialists and their special agent lackeys to spread rumors and deceptions. But precisely because of this, it is even more necessary for us to expand the peace signature campaign and give the most universal basic education to the people of the whole country.

### 为在全国争取两万万个和平签名者而奋斗

　　为在全国争取两万万个和平签名者而奋斗
    为了扩大中国的和平签名运动，中国保卫世界和平大会委员会已于十三日向全国各人民团体发出通知，号召全国人民继续努力，争取一万万五千万至两万万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名。各人民团体已响应这个号召，表示决心为实现这一光荣的任务而努力。
    中国的和平签名运动已进行了三个多月。在全国和平战士们的努力下，全国现已有近六千万人在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的和平宣言上签了名。现在全世界已有的和平签名者是二亿八千多万，中国的签名人数占这一数的五分之一以上。但是我们绝不能满足于现有的成绩。如果我们把我国现有的签名数字和中国的总人口作一比较，我们就会知道这一数字还不算大。苏联和许多人民民主国家在这一方面已走在我们的前面。苏联人口是二万万，但苏联的签名人数却已有一亿一千五百多万。朝鲜、匈牙利、波兰、捷克、保加利亚等国家的签名人数都在全国人口的百分之八十上下。我们应当努力向这些兄弟国家看齐。
    必须把和平签名运动在中小城镇中和农村中造成广泛的群众运动，这就是目前的任务。有些地区的签名工作进行得较好，例如东北区的签名人数已接近全区人口的一半，上海、重庆的签名人数已达人口的百分之八十以上，北京、天津等地的签名人数也已超过人口的百分之五十。但大部分的地区签名工作进行得还薄弱。现在应当把先进地区的经验推广到这些地方去。中国的人口实际上约有五万万，两万万个签名者还只占人口总数的百分之四十，因此达到两万万个签名者的目标并不是困难的。
    在和平签名运动中，必须进行充分的宣传动员工作。进行宣传动员的方式可以多种多样。但是无论用什么方式，总要有一定数目的担负宣传工作的人员。凡是进行签名运动的地方，最好先征集一批为签名运动服务的宣传员。各民主政党的党员，各人民团体的会员特别是农民协会会员，少年儿童队员，青年团员和学校里的学生和教师，部队的政治工作人员，和一切种类的艺术工作者，都可以充当这样的宣传员。他们可以在街头、市集和会议中征集签名，也可以挨户进行家庭访问，征求所有的男女老少在和平宣言上签名。每一个宣传员都应该准备动人的宣传资料和宣传技巧，努力争取成百成千的人在和平宣言上签名。上海市家庭妇女联合会会员张丽萍曾以忘我的工作征集了二千二百个人在和平宣言上签名。张丽萍的例子，应该是一切和平战士进行工作的榜样。我们有了几十万几百万这样的和平战士，这样的宣传员，我们的国家的组织性和巩固性，就是大大地提高了，我们在宣传战线上，就是无敌的了。
    报纸应该为和平签名运动进行热烈的工作。在过去，许多报纸在这一方面做了工作，但是大多数报纸做得不能令人满意，应当在今后切实地加强。报纸应该经常地用显著地位和生动文字报道当地和平签名运动的情况，介绍签名运动的成功经验和模范事例。报纸应该负责向读者解释和平签名运动的意义，答复读者在和平签名运动中所提出的各种问题。只有这样，我们的签名运动才能成为生气勃勃的全民的运动。
    全国人民应当认识：和平签名运动不但是一个签名运动，而且是我们全国人民所上的一次无例外的政治课，而且是我们全国人民力量的一次空前的大检阅，大示威。由于美帝国主义正在加紧推行其侵略计划，由于我国近邻朝鲜和我国领土台湾已遭受到美国的武装侵略，我国人民必须加紧反对侵略的斗争。保卫世界和平，就是保卫我们每个中国人的生命财产。美帝国主义正在努力把世界推向战争的道路。全世界人民当前的任务就是要粉碎美帝国主义的侵略计划。朝鲜人民已经以他们的英勇斗争给了美帝国主义的战争冒险以严重打击。朝鲜人民的英勇斗争，加上以苏联、中国、东欧的八万万人为中坚的全世界人民反侵略斗争，是完全能够把帝国主义的战争贩子们打败的。这个真理，必须成为全中国每个穷乡僻壤的每个家庭中的普遍常识。是的，对于这个真理现在还有一些人不甚了了，将信将疑，他们还可以成为帝国主义者及其特务走狗们造谣欺骗的“防空洞”。但是正因为这样，我们就更加有必要扩大保卫和平签名运动，使全国同胞最普遍地受到一次基本教育。
