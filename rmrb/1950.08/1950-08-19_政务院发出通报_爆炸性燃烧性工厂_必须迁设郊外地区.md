Xinhua News Agency, 18th – To maintain social security and prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, in order to avoid the loss of materials, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, after reviewing the suggestions from Beijing Municipality, issued a circular on the 17th to the major administrative regions and directly governed provincial and municipal people's governments stating: All factories with explosive and combustible materials located in urban areas, suburban residential areas, and near government offices and schools should take necessary measures with reference to the suggestions of Beijing Municipality, and promptly and conscientiously urge their implementation within a prescribed time limit to eliminate unexpected hazards and ensure universal safety. The handling of this matter should be reported.

Note: Beijing Municipality, based on its experience in handling explosive and flammable factories, has stipulated that all match factories, firecracker manufacturers, mineral oil refineries, and other factories with explosive, flammable, or toxic and foul-smelling properties, such as sulfur factories and phosphorus sulfide factories, whether they are state-owned, private, or jointly owned by public and private entities, located inside and outside the city and in the suburbs, must comply with the regulations and be relocated to designated suburban areas within a specified time limit. Those factories located outside the urban area should also report to the Public Security Bureau within half a month from the date of the announcement for inspection and decision. Factories near highways, railways, villages, or power lines (electric and telephone lines) must be located at least 300 meters away. After each factory finds a suitable site in the designated area, it should draw up three detailed maps and submit them to the Public Security Bureau, the Industry Bureau, and the Construction Bureau for approval before starting construction. Factories that fail to relocate by the deadline, intending to wait and delay, will have their manufacturing tools sealed, their raw materials and finished products forcibly moved, and may be ordered to cease operations and have their business licenses revoked.

The main contents of the suggestions made by Beijing Municipality to the Government Administration Council based on the city's experience in handling explosive and flammable factories are: All dangerous factories with explosive and combustible materials should not be located in government offices, schools, or residential areas, but must be dispersed in open areas in the suburbs. Existing dangerous explosive industries should cease operations and relocate immediately. Warehouses for storing ammunition and dangerous goods should also not be located in densely populated areas but must be located in open areas in the suburbs. Existing warehouses should be dispersed immediately without delay. Not only should political security be emphasized for the above factories, workshops, and warehouses, but also attention should be paid to whether their safety equipment, machinery, warehouse management, and work methods affect security.

　　政务院发出通报
    爆炸性燃烧性工厂  必须迁设郊外地区
    【新华社十八日讯】为保持社会安全，防止土匪特务破坏，以避免物资的损失，中央人民政府政务院在审核北京市的建议后，于十七日向各大行政区及直属省市人民政府发出通报称：凡有建立在市内、城郊住宅区与机关、学校附近地区具有爆炸性燃烧性的工厂，均应参照北京市的建议作必要措施，并迅速地切实地限期分别督促执行，以期意外危害得以免除，普遍安全获得保障。并将办理情形具报。按：北京市对爆炸易燃等危险性工厂的处理曾规定凡开设在内外城区及关厢的火柴厂、花炮竹、矿油炼制厂及其他有爆炸、易燃、毒臭性质之工厂，如硫磺厂、硫化磷厂等，无论其为公营、私营或公私合营，均须遵照规定限期一律迁往郊外指定地区。其在城关区以外地区开设者，亦应于通告日起半个月内向公安局申报，经查勘后决定。其在公路、铁路、村庄、电线（电力、话线）附近者，应距三百公尺以外方准设厂。各工厂于指定地区觅妥厂址后，应即绘制详图三份分报公安、工业、建设三局申请批准后再行筹建。各工厂如逾期不迁意图观望延违，除至期封闭制造工具，将原料成品强制迁移外，并得勒令歇业，吊销营业执照。
    北京市根据该市处理爆炸性、易燃性工厂的经验向政务院提出建议的主要内容是：各地富有爆炸性、燃烧性等危险工厂，均不得设于机关、学校、市民住宅区，必须分散设在郊外空旷地点。旧有的爆炸性危险工业，应一律停止营业，立即迁移。储存军火，危险物品的仓库，亦不得设于人烟稠密地区，必须设在郊外空旷地方，其旧有者，应即设法疏散，不得拖延。对以上工厂、作坊、仓库等，不仅应从政治上注意保安，而且应注意其安全设备、机器装置、仓库管理、工作方法等是否影响保安。
