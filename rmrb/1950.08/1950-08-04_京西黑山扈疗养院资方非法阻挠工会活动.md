To the Editors:

The privately-owned Heishanhu Sanatorium began preparations to establish a trade union half a year ago, but has been repeatedly obstructed by the hospital authorities. On May 23rd, Comrade Shen Zhenqi, the chairman of the trade union preparatory committee, went to the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to discuss the establishment of a trade union, and was reprimanded and threatened by the院长 (Dean) Chen Zhaolong, who said: "Lao Shen, if you organize a trade union, don't make mistakes! It's best not to go to the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, otherwise, you should think carefully (referring to the possibility of losing your job)." On the same day, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions approved the establishment of the trade union in our hospital.

On June 22nd, when all the hospital staff were electing union members, Lou Dongming, the secretary of the hospital affairs office, and two others brought eight ballots (all with Lou Dongming's name written on them) to participate in the election. On the 23rd, when the trade union committee was being elected, Li Yongxiang, the personnel administrator, brought another six ballots, also with Lou Dongming's name written on them. According to what we know, before the election, Secretary Lou Dongming, Farm Director Fei Chonghai, and Nursing Director Zhou Lishuang discussed how to manipulate the election under the clock tower in the front mountain, forcibly ordering everyone to elect Lou Dongming and Fei Chonghai in advance. They also deployed people around the venue, forcing the chairman to allow non-members to enter the election. They suppressed the chairman and members' speeches, using illegal means to make Lou Dongming elected as the chairman of the trade union, and non-members Zhou Lishuang and Ding Jian were also elected as alternate members of the trade union.

These facts fully expose the hospital (capitalist) side's planned suppression of democracy within the hospital, attempting to maintain its past consistent autocratic style.

We request:

(1) The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should promptly send people to investigate the details and reorganize the trade union.

(2) We believe that the capitalist's manipulation of the election is a violation of government decrees and should be subject to certain legal actions.

(3) We request the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions or the 16th District Federation of Trade Unions to send cadres to regularly contact us and strengthen our political and ideological education.

Editor's Note: It is the legitimate and legal right of workers to establish their own organization, the trade union, and it is protected by national law, and no one may infringe upon it. Article 1 of the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "Trade unions are mass organizations voluntarily formed by the working class. All manual and mental workers who are employed laborers within the territory of China in all enterprises, institutions, and schools, whose wage income is all or the main source of their livelihood, and employed laborers without fixed employers, have the right to organize trade unions." Article 18 stipulates: "The administrative side or capitalists of production units or administrative units such as factories, mines, stores, farms, institutions, and schools shall not hinder the activities of the trade union grassroots committee and the activities of the general membership meeting or representative meeting convened by it." The actions of the capitalist of the private Heishanhu Sanatorium in the Western Suburbs of Beijing in obstructing the establishment of a trade union by the employees of the hospital and interfering with the trade union election are illegal, and the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions should handle it as soon as possible.

### 京西黑山扈疗养院资方非法阻挠工会活动

　　京西黑山扈疗养院资方非法阻挠工会活动
    编辑同志：
    私营黑山扈疗养院，在半年前就开始着手筹备成立工会，但屡次遭到院方的阻挠。五月二十三日本院工会筹备主任委员沈震岐同志到北京市总工会商洽成立工会事宜，竟遭到院长陈兆龙的申斥和威胁说：“老沈，你搞工会，可不要犯错误！市总工会还是不去的好，否则，你就好好考虑（意指考虑饭碗问题）。”当天，京市总工会批准了本院工会的成立。
    六月二十二日，当全院职工正进行工会人员的选举时，本院事务所秘书娄东明等三人带来选票八张（上面都写着娄东明的名字）前来参加选举；二十三日在工会委员会进行选举时，人事管理员李永祥又带来选票六张，上面也写着娄东明的名字。据我们所知：在选举前，秘书娄东明与农场主任费崇海、护理主任周沥霜在前山钟楼下商谈过如何操纵选举，事前强令大家选举娄东明、费崇海。又在会场四周布置了人，强迫主席允许非会员入场选举。他们压制主席及会员的发言，以非法手段使娄东明当选工会主任、非会员周沥霜、丁坚也被当选为工会的后补委员。
    这些事实，充分地暴露了院方（资方）有计划地压制院内民主，企图保持过去一贯的独断独行的作风。
    我们要求：
    （一）市总工会迅速派人调查详情，并重新组织工会。
    （二）我们认为资方操纵选举是违犯政府法令的行为，应予一定法律上的处理。
    （三）要求市总工会或十六区工会派干部经常与我们连系并对我们加强政治和思想教育。
    京西黑山扈疗养院职工沈震歧、关怀仁等二十七人（签名盖章）
    编者按：工人建立自己的组织——工会，是工人正当的合法权利，受国家法律保障，任何人不得侵犯。中华人民共和国工会法第一条规定：“工会是工人阶级自愿结合的群众组织。凡在中国境内一切企业、机关和学校以工资收入为其生活资料之全部或主要来源之体力与脑力的雇佣劳动者及无固定雇主的雇佣劳动者，均有组织工会之权”。第十八条规定：“工厂、矿场、商店、农场、机关、学校等生产单位或行政单位的行政方面或资方，不得妨碍工会基层委员会及所召集之全体会员大会或代表会议之活动。”京西私营黑山扈疗养院资方阻挠该院职工成立工会，及干涉工会选举的行为是非法的，京市总工会应尽速予以处理。
