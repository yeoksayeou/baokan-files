　　Xinhua News Agency, 16th: During the battles in early July to liberate the Shengsi Islands off the Yangtze River estuary and the recent battles to liberate the islands off the Pearl River Estuary, Chinese sailors gloriously completed their mission of supporting the People's Liberation Army's advance. In the battle to liberate the Shengsi Islands, Shanghai's sailors not only completed their navigation tasks with steadfastness and composure, but they also voluntarily assisted the PLA in mass work after landing. In this battle, the sailors of fifteen ships were awarded collective certificates of merit; sailors Ding Xinglong, Chen Shanting, and six others were awarded the title of "Meritorious Servicemen for Supporting the Front." After the liberation of Hainan Island, Wuhan's sailors immediately requested to participate in the work of supporting the PLA in liberating the islands off the Pearl River Estuary. They cleaned the cabins and repaired the machinery day and night, awaiting orders to depart. After the battle began, the sailors steered their ships, broke through raging waves, and braved storms to transport the soldiers to land smoothly and launch island-by-island attacks. They stuck to their posts without fear under enemy fire, and whenever there was a break, they busied themselves checking the machinery to ensure the completion of the transportation mission. The driver of a certain vessel, Li Dexin, strived to be the first ship to land four times during ten consecutive days of landing operations. The sailors said: Being with the People's Liberation Army is our greatest glory!

    海员光荣完成支援进军任务
    若干人获集体奖或功臣称号
    【新华社十六日讯】中国海员们在七月上旬解放长江口外嵊泗列岛和最近解放珠江口外群岛的各次战斗中，光荣地完成了支援人民解放军进军的任务。在解放嵊泗列岛的战斗中，上海的海员们不仅坚定沉着地完成了驾驶的任务，他们在登陆后还自动协助解放军进行群众工作。在这次战斗中，有十五艘船的海员荣获集体奖状；海员丁兴隆、陈汕汀等八人荣膺“支前功臣”的称号。武汉的海员们在海南岛解放后，即要求参加支援解放军解放珠江口外群岛的工作。他们日夜地擦洗船舱、整修机器待命出发。战斗开始后，海员们驾驶着船只，突破惊涛骇浪，不顾狂风暴雨，运送战士们顺利登陆并展开逐岛攻击。他们在敌人的射击下坚持岗位毫无畏惧，而且一有空隙就忙着检查机件，以保证运送任务的完成。某艇的驾驶员李德新在十几天连续的登陆作战中，四次争取了登陆第一船。海员们表示：能够和解放军在一起，是我们最大的光荣！
