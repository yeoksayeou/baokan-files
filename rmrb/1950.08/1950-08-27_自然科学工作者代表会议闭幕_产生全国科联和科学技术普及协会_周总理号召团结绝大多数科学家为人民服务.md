　　Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The Representative Conference of Natural Science Workers of China, which opened on the 18th of this month, concluded on the 24th. Participating in the conference were 468 representatives from relevant scientific organs of the Central People's Government, relevant scientific organs affiliated with the People's Liberation Army and the People's Revolutionary Military Commission, various regions, various ethnic groups, and the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee. During the conference, Vice Chairmen of the Central People's Government Zhu De and Li Jishen, Premier of the Government Administration Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Huang Yanpei, Vice Chairman of the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council Ma Xulun, Minister of Communications Zhang Bojun, and Minister of Water Resources Fu Zuoyi attended to provide guidance. The conference heard work reports from the Academy of Sciences, industrial departments, agricultural departments, and health departments; discussed and resolved a portion of the technical problems and proposals put forward by various industrial sectors. The conference established the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies and the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, and elected Li Siguang, Hou Debang, Mao Yisheng, Liu Ding, Yan Jici, Ding Zan, Nizhabuding (Uyghur) and 43 others totaling fifty as members of the National Committee of the Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies; Liang Xi, Ding Xielin, Zhu Kezhen, Yuan Hanqing, Lu Yudao, Zhou Huanzhang, Ma Dianbieke (Kyrgyz) and 43 others totaling fifty as members of the National Committee of the Association for Science and Technology Popularization; and passed Wu Yuzhang as the honorary chairman of both committees.

　　Premier Zhou Enlai attended the conference and delivered a report before its closing. Premier Zhou pointed out that the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates the construction of a new China that is independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous, and that transforming China from an agricultural country into an industrial country is also the fighting goal of Chinese scientists. Premier Zhou said that our current financial and economic situation has begun to improve, but it will still take about three to five years of a difficult stage to achieve fundamental improvement, which is the stage of recovery, rectification, investigation, and focused construction. Premier Zhou pointed out that even during this stage, a large number of scientists are needed to work, so it is necessary to quickly investigate and count the natural scientists nationwide and train more young scientific workers. Premier Zhou pointed out that in order to work effectively, scientists must unite; and in order to unite, it is necessary to distinguish between enemies and friends, to break down sectarianism, and to unite the vast majority of scientists who are willing to serve the people, opposing only the very few scientists who are determined to serve imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism. Premier Zhou said that even for those scientists who are still working for the reactionaries but are not determined to be enemies of the people, as long as they are willing to truly change their position and admit their mistakes to the people, we should strive to get them to serve the motherland of the people.

　　The conference was summarized by Zeng Zhaolun. The gist of Zeng Zhaolun's summary report was: The achievement of this conference is, first, the manifestation of unprecedented great unity in the scientific community. The scientific workers participating in this conference listened to the work reports of various industrial departments of the government and initially understood the situation of national economic construction; second, the organization of natural science workers was strengthened, and two organizations, the Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies and the Association for Science and Technology Popularization, were established, and the nature and tasks of scientific organizations were determined. Third, the combination of theory and practice in the scientific community has been specifically advanced. At the meeting, the industrial sectors raised 159 issues related to science and technology and theory in their work, of which 73 have been resolved by experts from various fields during the conference; preliminary opinions and approaches to solving 48 issues have been proposed; and 38 issues require a longer period of research. This spirit of responsibly discussing and solving problems has created a good example for the combination of scientific research and practical work.

　　The conference concluded after a closing speech by Liang Xi.

　　自然科学工作者代表会议闭幕
    产生全国科联和科学技术普及协会
    周总理号召团结绝大多数科学家为人民服务
    【新华社二十六日讯】本月十八日开幕的中华全国自然科学工作者代表会议已于二十四日结束。参加这次会议的有中央人民政府有关科学机关、人民解放军和人民革命军事委员会所属有关科学机关、各地区、各兄弟民族和筹备委员会常委会的代表共四百六十八人。会议期间，中央人民政府副主席朱德、李济深，政务院总理周恩来、副总理黄炎培，政务院文化教育委员会副主任马叙伦、交通部长章伯钧、水利部长傅作义等都出席指导。会议听取了科学院、工业部门、农业部门和卫生部门的工作报告；讨论并解决了各产业部门所提出的一部分技术问题和提案。会议产生了中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会和中华全国科学技术普及协会，并选出李四光、侯德榜、茅以升、刘鼎、严济慈、丁瓒、尼札布丁（维吾尔族）等五十人为自然科学专门学会联合会全国委员会委员；梁希、丁燮林、竺可桢、袁翰青、卢于道、周焕章、马典别克（柯尔别兹族）等五十人为科学技术普及协会全国委员会委员；并通过吴玉章为两委员会的名誉主席。
    周恩来总理在会议闭幕前到会作报告。周总理指出：人民政协共同纲领规定了建设独立、民主、和平、统一和富强的新中国，要把中国由一个农业国变为工业国，这也就是规定了中国科学家的奋斗目标。周总理说：目前我们的财政经济情况已开始好转，但要达到基本好转还需要经过三五年左右的困难阶段，也就是恢复、整顿、调查和有重点地建设的阶段。周总理指出：就在这个阶段，也就需要大批科学家来工作，因此需要迅速地调查和统计全国的自然科学家，并培养更多的青年科学工作者。周总理指出：为了有效地工作，科学家必须团结；而为了团结，就必须分清敌友，必须破除门户之见，团结占绝大多数的愿意为人民服务的科学家，仅仅反对极少数坚决为帝国主义、为官僚资本主义服务的科学家。周总理说：即使对那些现在还为反动派工作而并不坚决与人民为敌的科学家，只要他们愿意确实改变立场，向人民承认错误，我们也应当争取他们为人民的祖国服务。
    会议由曾昭抡作总结报告。曾昭抡的总结报告大意说：这次会议的成就，第一是表现了科学界空前的大团结。参加这次会议的科学工作者听取了政府各产业部门的工作报告，初步了解了国家经济建设的情况；第二是加强了自然科学工作者的组织，产生了自然科学专门学会联合会和科学技术普及协会两个组织，并确定了科学团体的性质和任务。第三是使科学界的理论和实际的结合具体地推进了一步。会上各产业部门所提出的工作中的有关科学技术和理论的问题达一百五十九件，在会议过程中经各方面专家研究已解决了的有七十三件；有四十八件提出了解决的初步意见和途径；有三十八件需要较长时间加以研究。这种负责讨论和解决问题的精神，为科学研究和实际工作结合创造了很好的范例。
    会议在梁希致闭幕词后结束。
