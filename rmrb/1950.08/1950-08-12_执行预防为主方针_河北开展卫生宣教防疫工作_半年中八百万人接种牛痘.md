　　Implementing the Policy of Prevention First
    Hebei Carries Out Health Education and Epidemic Prevention Work
    Eight Million People Vaccinated Against Smallpox in Six Months
    [Our Newspaper] In accordance with the general policy of prioritizing prevention in health work, Hebei Province has made preliminary achievements in health promotion and education, prevention of infectious diseases, and improvement of maternal and child health this year.
  Promoting Health Exhibitions Using Examples for Propaganda
    The province's health education work currently focuses on introducing knowledge about the prevention of infectious diseases and maternal and child health. The Provincial Health Department has compiled and printed some popular booklets on health knowledge, which are disseminated to the masses through health cadres, primary school teachers, rural intellectuals, newspapers, blackboards, and radio stations. In February, a large-scale health exhibition was held in Baoding City, displaying over a thousand pictures related to epidemic prevention and maternal and child health, as well as over two hundred specimen models. In half a month, the audience reached 240,000, mostly farmers from dozens of miles away. Starting in April, a propaganda team was organized to carry pictures and models, accompanied by slide projectors, to the disaster areas of Tianjin, Cangxian, Tongxian, and Tangshan prefectures for health promotion and education. In three months, the audience exceeded 220,000. In addition, the Health Department plans to distribute a portion of health promotion exhibits (pictures, models, etc.) to counties throughout the province, and has already issued them to thirty-five units.
    This kind of visual education through pictures and models makes a deep impression on the masses. Many farmers, after visiting the exhibition, requested that such exhibitions be regularly held on tour in rural areas. In particular, maternal and child health is of great concern to the masses and is most easily accepted by them. The province's propaganda team is equipped with midwifery personnel during its work. Many pregnant women requested to have their fetal position checked after visiting the exhibition. A total of 636 people have been examined in the past three months. On the other hand, the most significant effect is achieved by publicizing actual examples to the masses. For example, the director of the Women's Federation in Panzhuang, Ninghe County, used her own pockmarked face as an example to educate the masses, and many "shy" women who were unwilling to be vaccinated volunteered to be vaccinated.
    In terms of epidemic prevention, the province's spring vaccination campaign, as of the end of June, according to statistics from 127 counties, 10 towns, and 4 cities, the number of people vaccinated has reached 8,153,235. Due to the relatively widespread vaccination, the number of smallpox cases in the first half of this year in the province has decreased by six-sevenths compared with the second half of last year; the mortality rate of smallpox patients has also decreased compared with last year.
  Uniting the Broad Masses of Chinese and Western Doctors to Train Local Vaccination Personnel
    The reason why these achievements can be made is mainly due to the mobilization and organization of the power of the broad masses. According to statistics from eight prefectures and cities, a total of more than 8,200 local Chinese and Western doctors were united in the vaccination campaign to carry out this work together. At the same time, more than 21,200 village cadres, women cadres, and activists were absorbed to participate, teaching them vaccination and simple disinfection methods. This force not only solved the manpower difficulties of vaccination, but also played a very good propaganda effect among the masses. In particular, the propaganda and persuasion work of the women's federations at all levels broke through many feudal superstitious legends and the difficulties of women being shy and unwilling to be vaccinated, which were the most serious obstacles to vaccination work.
    Establishing Health Organizations at All Levels to Vigorously Prevent and Control Epidemics in Disaster Areas
    At the same time, in order to prevent and control infectious diseases, especially epidemics in disaster areas, the province has initially established leading agencies for epidemic prevention organizations at all levels. Since the provincial health conference held in February, 6,236 epidemic prevention committees have been established at all levels in prefectures, counties, cities, towns, and villages, effectively leading the epidemic prevention work in various places. Epidemic prevention teams and epidemic prevention groups have been organized in various places. In addition to carrying out general epidemic prevention work, the disaster area epidemic prevention teams have also studied and introduced the edible methods of wild plants, wrote them into booklets and leaflets, and distributed them to disaster areas for publicity, reducing the incidence of food poisoning among disaster victims. Since the beginning of summer, various places have been carrying out summer epidemic prevention work.
    Training Midwifery Personnel to Reduce Infant Mortality
    In terms of improving maternal and child health, in the past six months, Hengshui Prefecture alone has trained 3,111 new and old birth attendants. These trained personnel are generally able to use new methods of delivery and have carried out health education on maternal and child health to the broad masses of women. Preliminary results have been achieved in reducing infant mortality rates. According to statistics from the fourth district of Ji County in half a year, among 321 children delivered by new methods, only 24 died; while among 604 children delivered by old birth attendants, 117 died.
    Two Main Shortcomings
    Experience in the past six months has proved that in order to do a good job in health work with prevention as the main focus, health agencies must do thorough organizational work in peacetime, mobilize the broad masses of cadres and activists through governments and people's organizations at all levels to promote work, and at the same time carry out patient persuasion and explanation, and strictly prevent the purely task-oriented viewpoint and coercive command style. However, in some areas, such as certain areas in Yutian and Xian County, local armed forces were deployed and checkpoints were set up during injections to force the masses to inject, which made many people afraid to go to the market. In some areas of Tongxian Prefecture, it even caused the masses to collectively "escape injection famine," an evil result. In addition, leading cadres in some areas do not pay enough attention to health work. For example, after measles was discovered in Xingtang County, it was not reported to the Health Department until two months after the epidemic; the measles epidemic in Funing County has not yet been reported upward, and it was not discovered until the epidemic prevention team arrived in the local area. Wang Zhenguo, the county head and director of the Epidemic Prevention Committee of Ninghe County, did not allow the head of the health section to organize rural doctors and carry medicines to the countryside for prevention and treatment in the smallpox epidemic area. Only after the local Party committee put forward criticism and suggestions did he establish a prevention and treatment team to work in the countryside. These bureaucratic and coercive command styles should be effectively corrected.

　　执行预防为主方针
    河北开展卫生宣教防疫工作
    半年中八百万人接种牛痘
    【本报讯】根据预防为主的卫生工作总方针，河北省本年在开展卫生宣传教育、预防传染病、改善妇婴卫生等工作上已做出了初步成绩。
  推广卫生展览利用实例宣传
    该省卫生宣教工作，目前着重介绍传染病的预防知识和妇婴卫生知识。省府卫生厅曾编印一部分通俗的关于卫生知识的小册子，通过卫生干部、小学教员和乡村知识分子、报纸、黑板报、广播电台等向群众宣传。二月份并曾在保定市举行了一次规模较大的卫生展览会，陈列了千余幅有关防疫和妇婴卫生的图画和二百多种标本模型。半个月中观众达二十四万，大部分是几十里外的农民。四月份起，组织了一个宣传队，携带图画、模型，配合幻灯赴天津、沧县、通县、唐山四个专区的灾区进行卫生宣传教育。三个月来观众超过二十二万。另外，卫生厅并计划发给全省各县一部分卫生宣传展览品（图画、模型等），目前已发出三十五个单位。
    这种通过图画、模型等进行的形象教育，给群众印象很深。许多农民参观展览会后，都要求把这种展览经常到农村中去巡回举行。特别是妇婴卫生最为群众关心，也最易为群众接受。该省宣传队在进行工作时配备了助产人员，许多怀孕妇女在参观展览会之后即要求检查胎位，三个月来共检查了六百三十六名。另一方面，通过实际事例对群众宣传，所收效果最显著。如宁河县潘庄妇会主任，以自己的麻脸作实例来教育群众，许多“怕羞”不愿种痘的妇女也自愿要接种了。
    在防疫工作方面，该省本年的春季种痘，截至六月底止，据一百二十七县、十镇、四市统计，种痘人数已达八百一十五万三千二百三十五人。由于种痘比较普遍，该省本年上半年天花发病人数较去年下半年减少了七分之六；天花患者的死亡率也比去年降低。
  团结广大中西医生训练地方种痘人员
    所以能做出这些成绩，主要是由于发动、组织了广大群众的力量。据八个专区、市的统计，在种痘中一共团结了八千二百余名地方中西医协同进行此一工作，同时，并吸收了二万一千二百余名村干部、妇女干部和群众积极分子参加，教会了他们种痘和简易的消毒方法。这批力量，不独解决了种痘的人力困难，而且在群众中发挥了很好的宣传效果。特别是各级妇联会的宣传说服工作，打破了阻碍种痘工作最厉害的许多封建迷信传说和妇女怕羞不种痘的难关。
    建立各级卫生组织大力防治灾区疫病
    同时，为了防治传染病，特别是灾区的疫病，该省已初步建立了各级防疫组织领导机构。自二月份举行全省卫生会议之后，各专区、县、市、镇、村先后建立了各级防疫委员会六千二百三十六个，有效地领导了各地的防疫工作。各地并组织了防疫队和防疫组。灾区防疫队除进行了一般的防疫工作之外，并研究、介绍了野生植物的食用法，写成小册子和传单，分发灾区宣传，减少了灾民的食物中毒事件。入夏以来，各地正进行夏季防疫工作。
    训练助产人员减少婴孩死亡
    在改善妇婴卫生工作方面，半年来，仅衡水专区已训练了新旧接产人员三千一百十一名。这些受训人员一般已能用新法接生，并对广大妇女进行了有关妇婴卫生的宣传教育。在减少婴儿死亡率上已初步收效。据冀县四区半年中统计，用新法接生的小孩三百二十一名，死亡仅二十四名；而旧接产妇收生的六百零四个孩子，死亡达一百一十七名。
    两个主要缺点
    半年来的经验证明，要作好以预防为主的卫生工作，卫生机关必须在平时做好周密的组织工作，通过各级政府和人民团体，发动广大干部与群众积极分子来推进工作，同时要进行耐心的说服解释，严防单纯的任务观点与强迫命令作风。可是部分地区，如玉田、献县等某些地区，在进行注射时配备地方武装，设立关卡，强迫群众注射，竟使许多群众不敢赶集。通县专区某些地区，甚至造成群众集体“逃注射荒”的恶果。另外，某些地区的领导干部，对卫生工作不够重视。如行唐县发现麻疹，流行两月之后才报告卫生厅；抚宁县麻疹流行迄未向上报告，直到防疫队到当地才发现。宁河县长兼防疫委员会主任王振国，在天花流行区，竟不让卫生科长组织在乡医生、携带药品下乡防治，后经中共地委提出批评意见后才建立防治组下乡工作。这些官僚主义和强迫命令的作风，是应该切实注意纠正的。
