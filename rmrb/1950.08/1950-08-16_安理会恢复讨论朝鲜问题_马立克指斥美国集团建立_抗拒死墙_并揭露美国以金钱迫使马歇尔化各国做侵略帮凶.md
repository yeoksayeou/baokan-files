Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: TASS, New York, August 15th - On August 14th, the Security Council, under the presidency of Soviet representative Malik, resumed discussion of the Korean issue.

　　At the beginning of the meeting, the French translation of Malik's speech on August 11th was first read. In that speech, Malik condemned the US aggression against Korea and presented the Soviet program for a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict.

　　Ecuador's representative Quevedo spoke at the meeting, unsurprisingly supporting the US position. Quevedo opposed the Security Council hearing the North Korean representative's views because, according to him, North Korea was the "aggressor" and disregarded the Security Council's resolution demanding North Korea withdraw north of the 38th parallel. Quevedo denied that the Security Council's resolution on Korea was intended to cover up US aggression.

　　Next to speak was Norway's representative Sunde. In a lengthy speech, he implemented the stalling tactics of the US-British bloc, attempting to blame the procedural deadlock created by the aforementioned US-British bloc in the Security Council on the Soviet Union. Sunde insisted that Malik was only engaging in a propaganda campaign and neglecting the real issues before the Security Council. He declared that Malik's action to expel the Kuomintang representative from the Security Council was an overreach of authority. He also asserted that Malik's refusal to "rule" on the Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu's request to invite representatives of the Syngman Rhee group to attend was also a violation of the Security Council's procedural rules.

　　Malik had suggested that the Kuomintang representative's proposal be put to a vote later and that the Soviet representative's proposal to invite representatives of the Korean people, including representatives from both North and South Korea, to attend the meeting should be voted on first. Sunde opposed Malik's suggestion and supported the US and Kuomintang representatives' demand that representatives of the Syngman Rhee group attend. Sunde then spoke in a very casual manner, saying that Malik's actions raised the question of whether the Soviet Union intended to prevent discussion and resolution of the problem.

　　After Sunde finished speaking, India's representative Rau informally suggested establishing a committee consisting of six non-permanent members of the Security Council to study all proposals regarding Korea and submit recommendations for action to the Security Council.

　　When speaking, Rau first stated that the difficulty in resolving the Korean issue was mainly caused by the tension between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rau suggested: Appointing a committee composed of non-permanent members of the Security Council to study the motions and recommendations put forward by all parties regarding the Korean issue and submit recommendations to the Security Council on a designated date; this might alleviate this tension. If the Security Council deems it appropriate, it may act on the recommendations made by the committee. Rau further suggested: The committee's work could also assist in resolving the issue of Korean unification after the end of the Korean War. Rau stated that if his suggestion received support in principle, he would submit a formal motion based on this approach.

　　The next speaker was France's representative Chauvel, who repeated Ecuador's representative's attacks on Malik. Chauvel expressed regret that the Soviet representative began serving as President of the Security Council on August 1st. He asserted that since Malik took office, the Security Council had accomplished nothing. According to Chauvel, the Soviet Union, in addition to attempting to obstruct the Security Council in aiding North Korea, also attempted to undermine the unity of the Security Council member states, isolate the United States, and portray the United States as an aggressor. Chauvel simply stated that he supported Indian representative Rau's proposal.

　　Malik then responded to Chauvel and Sunde, exposing their sophistry. Malik pointed out that in previous meetings, he had already answered the questions that Sunde raised again on August 14th. Malik said: The Soviet delegation has clearly stated its position on the substantive and procedural aspects of the Korean issue. He said: The crocodile tears of Sunde and Chauvel regarding the so-called disruption of Security Council procedures will not convince anyone that it is sincere or earnest. Because these statements, made under US pressure, clearly violate the provisions of the United Nations Charter, namely: hearing the views of both sides in a conflict that threatens peace and security.

　　Referring to Chauvel's remarks about the Soviet Union's return to the Security Council, Malik said: If the French representative thought that the Soviet Union returned to the Security Council to vote in favor of US aggression against the Korean people, then he would be greatly disappointed.

　　Malik again mentioned the "wall of resistance" against the Soviet proposal and declared that on July 31st, when the US Senate passed the Marshall Plan funds, it warned the Marshallized countries that if they did not assist the US aggression against Korea, they would not receive Marshall Plan funds. It was on this day that the representatives of the Marshallized countries received special instructions. Malik pointed out that this action, taken on the eve of the Soviet representative's presidency of the Security Council, constituted open and shameless pressure on the Security Council members. The United States has made it clear that it will not tolerate any Security Council resolution that does not suit the United States. Malik said to Norway's representative Sunde that this had made everything clear, and there was no need to say more.

　　Next, Malik pointed out that the Security Council's rules of procedure stipulated that the presidency rotate alphabetically, and said that the Soviet Union considered it necessary to fulfill its obligation to serve as President of the Security Council. At the same time, he called on the Security Council to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Malik said: The so-called "majority" of the Security Council (whose core is composed of the US group) has erected a "wall of resistance" against the Soviet proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and in order to confuse the dispute, it has attempted to put forward all sorts of unconvincing arguments. In response to Chauvel, Malik said: He did not expect a representative of a country that was waging a dirty war against the Vietnamese people fighting for independence to say anything else. Malik recalled that in a letter to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, the French government had compared the US actions in Korea to the French war in Vietnam.

　　At this point, Chauvel reluctantly and briefly responded to some of Malik's remarks, such as Malik's remarks about the Vietnam War.

　　In response, Malik exposed the inadequacy of the French representative's dissent. Malik emphasized that when he spoke of the French government's attitude towards Vietnam being the same as its attitude towards Korea, he had quoted official French documents, so that was the opinion of the French government and not the Soviet government.

　　The next meeting will be held on August 17th.

　　安理会恢复讨论朝鲜问题
    马立克指斥美国集团建立“抗拒死墙”
    并揭露美国以金钱迫使马歇尔化各国做侵略帮凶
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社纽约十五日讯：八月十四日，安全理事会由苏联代表马立克任主席，恢复对朝鲜问题的讨论。
    会议开始时，首先宣读了马立克在八月十一日发言的法文译文，在那次发言中，马立克斥责了美国对朝鲜的侵略，并提出苏联关于和平解决朝鲜冲突的纲领。
    厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎在会议上发言，不出所料，他支持美国的立场。奎维铎反对安理会听取北朝鲜代表陈述意见，因为，照他说，北朝鲜是“侵略者”，并且漠视了安理会要求北朝鲜退回三八线以北的决议。奎维铎否认安理会关于朝鲜的决议是打算掩盖美国的侵略。
    接着发言的是挪威代表森德。他在冗长的发言中实行了美英集团的阻挠策略，企图把上述美英集团在安理会中造成的程序僵局归咎于苏联。森德硬说，马立克只在从事宣传运动，而忽略了安理会面前的真正问题。他声言：马立克企图把国民党代表开除出安理会的行动，是逾越职权的。他又断言，马立克对于国民党代表蒋廷黻提出的请李承晚集团的代表出席的要求，拒绝加以“裁决”，这种行动也是违反安理会的程序规则的。
    马立克曾建议，国民党代表的建议留待以后表决，首先应表决苏联代表提出的请朝鲜人民的代表，包括南北朝鲜双方的代表在内，出席会议的建议。森德反对马立克的这个建议，他支持美国和国民党代表要李承晚集团的代表出席的要求。森德继即以极为随便的态度发言说，马立克的行动使人发生了苏联是否打算阻止问题的讨论和解决问题。
    在森德发言完毕之后，印度代表劳氏非正式地建议设立一个包括六个安理会非常任理事国的委员会，以研究各方提出的一切关于朝鲜的建议，并向安理会提出行动建议。
    劳氏发言时首称：解决朝鲜问题的困难，主要是由于美国与苏联之间的紧张所引起的。劳氏建议：指派由安理会非常任理事国组成的委员会，研究各方面关于朝鲜问题所提的议案与建议，并在指定的日期，向安理会提出建议；通过这种方法，或许可能减轻这种紧张。安理会如果认为合宜，即可根据该委员会所提的建议行事。劳氏又建议：该委员会的工作，也可在朝鲜战争终止后协助朝鲜统一问题的解决。劳氏称：如果他所提的这项建议在原则上获得支持，他愿根据这种方针提出正式动议。
    其次发言的是法国代表萧维尔，他重复厄瓜多尔代表对马立克的攻击。萧维尔对苏联代表八月一日开始担任安理会主席一事，表示遗憾。他断言：自马立克担任主席以来，安理会丝毫无所成就。按照萧维尔的话，苏联除企图阻扰安理会以援助北朝鲜外，又企图破坏安理会各理事国的团结，孤立美国并把美国形容成侵略者。萧维尔简单表示：他对印度代表劳氏的建议，抱赞成态度。
    马立克继即答复萧维尔和森德二人，并揭露二人的伪论。马立克指出，在以前的各项会议上，他已答复了森德在八月十四日再度提出的问题。马立克说：苏联代表团已经明确说明其对朝鲜问题的实质与程序方面的立场。他说：森德和萧维尔所作关于所谓破坏安理会程序的猫哭老鼠的假慈假悲的声明，不会使任何人相信它是真诚的、郑重的。因为在美国压力下所作的这些声明，明显地违反联合国宪章的规定，即：听取威胁和平及安全的冲突中的双方陈述意见。
    在提到萧维尔关于苏联返回安理会的发言时，马立克说：如果法国代表以为苏联返回安理会是为了投票赞成美国对朝鲜人民的侵略，那他就要大失所望了。
    马立克再度提到反对苏联之建议的“抗拒死墙”，并宣称，七月三十一日，美国参院通过马歇尔计划基金时曾警告各马歇尔化国家，如果他们不援助美国对朝鲜的侵略，就将得不到马歇尔计划的基金。就是在这一天，各马歇尔化国家的代表接到了特别训令。马立克指出，这一在苏联代表担任的安理会主席职务的前夕所采取的行动，对安理会理事国构成了公开而无耻的压力。美国曾明白地说明，它不容许任何不适合于美国的安理会的决议。马立克对挪威代表森德说，这已使一切事情都明白了，再不需要多说了。
    接着，马立克便指出安理会的程序规则规定按字母轮流担任主席职务，并说，苏联认为履行它的义务担任安理会主席是必要的，同时，他号召安理会和平解决朝鲜问题。马立克说：所谓安理会的“多数”（它的核心是由美国集团组成的）建立了“抗拒死墙”，反对苏联和平解决朝鲜问题的建议，并且为着使争端混乱，企图提出各种各色的毫无说服力的论据。在回答萧维尔时，马立克说：他并不期望一个正对为争取独立的越南人民进行肮脏战争的国家的代表会说出别种话来。马立克回忆说：法国政府在致联合国秘书长赖伊的函中，曾把美国在朝鲜的行动比之于法国对越南的战争。
    至此，萧维尔勉强地简短地答复马立克的某些发言，例如，马立克关于越南战争的发言。
    马立克在回答中揭露了法国代表的异议的不足取。马立克着重指出：当他谈到法国政府对越南的态度和对朝鲜的态度一样时，他是引证过法国的官方文件，因此，那是法国政府的而不是苏联政府的意见。
    下次会议将在八月十七日举行。
