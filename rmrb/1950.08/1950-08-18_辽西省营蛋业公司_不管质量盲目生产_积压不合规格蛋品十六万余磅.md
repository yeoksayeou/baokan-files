　　Liaoxi Provincial State-Run Egg Company
    Disregards Quality and Blindly Produces
    Accumulating Over 160,000 Pounds of Substandard Egg Products
    [This Newspaper's Report] According to a report in the Northeast Daily: The Liaoxi Provincial State-Run Egg Company, due to the bureaucratic practices of its leading cadres, has produced 230,200 pounds of egg yolk since production began in March of this year, of which 161,800 pounds are substandard, accounting for 70 percent of the total. Originally, the company did not have its own laboratory, and all products had to be sent to Tianjin for testing. In mid-May, the finished products were handed over to the section chief of the manager's section to be sent to Tianjin for testing. However, he did not send them immediately, but left them in his desk for three days, and then handed them over to the section chief of the sales and supply department to send to Tianjin. That section chief then delayed sending the samples for more than a month. During this period, the company's leadership not only did not inquire whether the samples had been sent for testing, but also blindly instructed the production of 4.98 million eggs. As a result, all the egg yolk produced was substandard, and, adding to the previous production, a total of 161,800 pounds were substandard, and are now all stockpiled in warehouses. Calculated at 145,000 yuan (Northeast currency) per pound, the total capital tied up is 23.461 billion yuan.

　　辽西省营蛋业公司
    不管质量盲目生产
    积压不合规格蛋品十六万余磅
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：辽西省营蛋业公司，由于领导干部存在官僚主义，致今年三月开工以来生产的二十三万零二百磅蛋黄中，有十六万一千八百磅不合规格，占总数百分之七十。原来该公司自己没有化验室，所出产品，均须送往天津化验。五月中旬将制出成品交给经理科长负责寄往天津化验。但他并未立即寄出，在办公桌里放了三天，又交给供销科经理股长寄往天津。而该经理股长将样子又压了一个多月没寄走。在这一时期中，该公司领导上不但没有追问过样子是否寄去化验了，而且盲目的指示打了四百九十八万蛋。结果制出的蛋黄全部不合规格，加上以前生产的，计有十六万一千八百磅不合标准，现在全部积压在仓库里。每磅按十四万五千元（东北币）计算，合计积压资金二百三十四亿六千一百万元。
