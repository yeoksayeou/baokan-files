    Dalian Machinery Factory Workers Achieve Success in Cultural Studies.
    Most illiterate students now recognize 1,200 characters and can read simple technical books, creating favorable conditions for learning technology and improving production.
    [This Newspaper reports] According to the "Luda People's Daily", the Dalian Machinery Factory has achieved remarkable results in workers' after-work cultural education. Starting in March of last year, the factory organized 230 illiterate workers to participate in cultural studies, accounting for 95% of the factory's illiterate workforce. Most of these students now recognize around 1,200 characters. Due to the improvement in their literacy, favorable conditions have been created for learning technology and improving production. More than 50 of them have already joined the factory's technical classes to learn technology. Generally, they can now understand simple mechanical theory books, have a preliminary understanding of mechanical principles, and have improved their skills, enabling them to complete or exceed production tasks. Worker Yang Shijie, based on his own experience combined with the principles described in books, improved his work methods when milling screw caps, increasing work efficiency by nearly 100%. Worker Zhang Fucai, when calling for rationalization proposals within the factory, used principles to devise a way to改造the iron furnace, eliminating the past problem of excessive coal consumption, increasing production efficiency by 60%, and saving four to five hundred pounds of coal per day.
    The main reason for these achievements is that the factory's leadership attaches importance to workers' cultural education. Before establishing the study classes last year, the factory's Communist Party General Branch Secretary, the Factory Director, the Trade Union Propaganda Section Chief, and the Design Section Chief visited other units several times to observe their organization of workers' cultural studies, learning from their experiences. After returning to the factory, they established five study classes. During the learning process, they were able to resolve any difficulties encountered in learning at any time. For example, in the early stages of learning, some workshops often affected workers' learning time due to meetings or other matters. The factory leadership immediately strictly stipulated work regulations and proposed that if meetings or overtime work were required during workers' learning time, it must be approved by the trade union in advance, and make up class time figured out before proceeding. This ensured the smooth progress of workers' learning. For example, during last year's production competition, although production in each workshop was very busy, workers never relaxed their studies, and the daily attendance rate of students was above 90%. At the same time, the factory's Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members not only actively studied in the classroom but also organized everyone to review their lessons after returning to the dormitory, playing a leading role in promoting learning throughout the factory.

　　大连机械厂工人文化学习有成绩
    大部文盲学员已识一千二百字，能看简单技术书籍，  为学习技术提高生产创造了有利条件。
    【本报讯】旅大人民日报消息：大连机械工厂的工人业余文化教育已有了显著的成绩。去年三月开始，该厂组织了二百三十名文盲工人参加文化学习，占全厂文盲工人的百分之九十五。这些学员现在大部已认识一千二百字左右。由于文化程度的提高，为学习技术、提高生产创造了有利条件。他们中已有五十余人参加了工厂的技术班学习技术。一般都已能看懂简单的机械理论书籍，初步明了了机械原理提高了技术，使生产任务能够完成或超过。工人杨世杰根据自己的经验结合书上所说的原理，在铣螺丝帽时，改进了工作方法，工作效率将近提高一倍；工人张富财在厂内号召提合理化建议时，他根据原理，想办法改造了烧铁炉，免除了过去费煤的毛病，使生产效率提高了百分之六十，并且每天能节省煤四、五百斤。
    获得这些成绩的主要原因，是该厂领导干部重视工人文化教育。在去年成立学习班之前，该厂中共总支书记、厂长、工会宣教科长和设计科长，曾数次到其他单位参观他们组织工人文化学习的情形，吸取了他们的经验，回厂后建立了五个学习班。在学习过程中，他们能随时解决学习中遇到的困难。如学习开始的初期，部分职场时常因开会或其他事情而影响了工人的学习时间。工厂领导上即严格地规定了工作制度，并提出在工人学习时间之内，如果要开会或加班，一定要事先通过工会批准，研究出补课时间后方可进行。这样，就保证了工人学习的顺利进行。如去年生产竞赛时，各职场生产虽然很忙，但工人从没有放松过学习，每天学员出席率都在百分之九十以上。同时，厂内的共产党员和青年团员，不但在课堂上积极学习，回到宿舍后还组织大家复习功课，在全厂的学习中起了带头推动作用。
