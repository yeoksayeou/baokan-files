(Shanghai News) *Jiefang Daily* reports: Ding Heng, director of the Qiujiang Machine Factory under the East China Industrial Department, lacks a serious attitude in accepting newspaper criticism. Although he made a self-criticism, shortcomings have been improved little. In May of this year, *Jiefang Daily* criticized the factory for being seriously detached from the masses and unable to complete its tasks. The factory director also made a self-criticism and expressed his determination to improve. However, three months have passed since then, and there has been little improvement in leadership style and production. In July, only 60 percent of the universal grinder parts produced by the factory passed inspection. Major products such as 30-horsepower single-cylinder hoists, anti-climbers, universal grinders, and tool grinders all failed to be delivered on schedule.

The main errors of the factory's leading cadres are: they did not recognize that raising the consciousness of the masses and giving full play to their enthusiasm for production are the basic conditions for doing a good job in production. Therefore, before the newspaper criticized them in May, they relied solely on administrative orders to lead production; after being criticized, they shirked and delayed work, and did not strive for improvement. There is a lack of overall planning in the arrangement of work, and there is no inspection or summary afterward; when accepting orders, the situation is underestimated, and the plan is repeatedly changed. Drawings are revised almost daily, resulting in low morale among workers, increased waste and rework, and the inability to complete tasks. The factory leaders also delay dealing with problems that workers urgently need to solve. The wage situation in the factory is extremely unreasonable. For example, Sun Jinxiang, the leader of the grinder group in the machine factory, has a base salary of 1.7 yuan, while apprentice Luo Dezhong has 1.8 yuan; the worker with the worst technical skills in the planer group receives the highest salary in the group (2.8 yuan). These unreasonable situations have been reflected by the workers many times, but have not been resolved to this day. Those who are active in their work or have made contributions to improving technology have not been commended, and those who are sloppy in their work and have caused serious waste have not been criticized or held accountable.

Due to the above reasons, some employees are dissatisfied with the leadership and lack a sense of responsibility and care for the factory. However, Director Ding Heng believes that the masses are backward and is afraid of getting close to them. He pushes many administratively decidable matters to the trade union, resulting in an increasing number of unresolved problems within the factory and a declining morale among the workers.

Editor's Note: The above facts show that the leadership of the Qiujiang Machine Factory has no understanding of the main shortcomings and errors that exist in the factory. Although a review has been made in the past, it remained verbal, and no practical improvements were made to the work. This is a perfunctory attitude towards correct criticism. It is hoped that the leaders of the Qiujiang Machine Factory will conduct a thorough review of these bad habits during the rectification campaign in order to quickly improve their work and complete the state's production tasks.

### 虬江机器厂厂长丁恒  接受批评缺乏严肃态度  虽作自我检讨但仍未积极努力改进工作

　　虬江机器厂厂长丁恒
    接受批评缺乏严肃态度
    虽作自我检讨但仍未积极努力改进工作
    【上海讯】解放日报消息：华东工业部虬江机器厂厂长丁恒，接受报纸批评的态度不严肃，虽经自我检讨，但缺点依然很少改进。今年五月间，解放日报曾对该厂严重脱离群众，不能完成任务进行了批评。该厂长也作了自我检讨，并表示决心改进。但至今为时三月，领导作风与生产情况却很少改进。七月份该厂生产万能磨床零件，经检验合格的只有百分之六十。主要产品中，三十匹单筒式卷扬机、防爬器、万能磨床、工具磨床等，均未能按期交货。
    该厂领导干部的主要错误是：没有认识到提高群众觉悟，发挥群众生产积极性是搞好生产的基本条件。因而在五月份报纸提出批评以前，是单纯依靠行政命令来领导生产；被批评后，对工作推诿拖拉，不力求改进。布置工作中缺乏全盘计划，事后又无检查和总结；接受订货时对情况估计不足，一再更改计划，绘图几乎每日都有修正，致使工人对生产情绪不高，废品和返工活增多，任务不能完成。对工人迫切要求解决的问题，该厂领导人员亦拖延不作处理。该厂工资情况极不合理，如机器工厂磨床组组长孙金香的底薪为一元七角，而学徒罗德中却为一元八角；刨床组技术最差的一个工人，拿全组最高的工资（二元八角），这些不合理情况经工人多次反映，拖到现在仍未解决。工作积极或改进技术有功者没有受到表扬，工作马虎而有严重浪费的，也没有进行批评和追究责任。
    由于以上原因，造成了部分职工对领导的不满，对工厂缺乏责任心和爱护，而厂长丁恒却反认为群众落后，害怕与群众接近，把许多行政上可以决定的事情也推给工会，致使厂内拖延未决的问题愈积愈多，工人情绪也愈趋低落。
    编者按：以上这些事实说明，虬江机器厂领导方面对该厂存在的主要缺点与错误并无认识。过去虽曾作过检讨，但停留在口头上，对工作未加切实改进，这是对正确的批评采取搪塞的态度。希望虬江机器厂领导人员在整风中，对这些不良作风严加检讨，以期迅速改进工作，完成国家生产任务。
