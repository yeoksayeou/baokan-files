　　Learning Role Model Zhao Yanlan
    Yan Chengyu
    Last winter, when Songjiang Province held a literacy campaign award ceremony, Zhao Yanlan was honorably selected as a learning role model. This spring, she was again selected as a production role model, a cadre role model, and a military family member role model. She is the women's director of Erba Jing Village, Wanbao District, Hulan County, and a member of the Communist Party.

    When the government called for running winter schools last winter, she was the first to sign up and helped women who were unwilling to go to school solve their difficulties, mobilizing them to enroll.

    She is the leader of the study group. Every day, she is the first to go to the school to sweep the floor, light the lamps, and warm up the house. If anyone doesn't come, she runs to greet them...

    After the award ceremony, she thought, "I've been selected as a role model, so I should take the lead and help everyone learn better." A month later, she wrote a letter to the Provincial Department of Education, saying, "After returning from the province, I conveyed the meeting's message and the learning task of recognizing a thousand characters by the end of the year. Everyone is very enthusiastic and has made specific plans... We have divided into thirteen groups, with each person learning three characters a day. We guarantee to do a good job in learning."

    In order to adapt to production, this summer when they changed the literacy class into field groups, some women couldn't understand: "We have to go to the fields, and we are very busy, how can we have time to learn?" "We can learn in winter, but not in summer!" Seeing that everyone had concerns, Zhao Yanlan went to each house to mobilize them. With her active mobilization, the number of women students greatly increased.

    During spring plowing and summer weeding, the students carried their culture textbooks with them every day when they went to work in the fields. Zhao Yanlan urged everyone while working: "Everyone, hurry up and work, so we can learn characters at the field. Today we will learn the four characters 'the ground must be cleaned'." During breaks, the students formed a circle, and the little teacher taught the characters. Sometimes, they also read newspapers and "New Countryside" magazines to everyone. In this way, many people who were not used to learning in the fields also got used to it, saying, "It doesn't delay work, it doesn't interfere with rest, and you can learn characters."

    When it rained and they couldn't work in the fields, Zhao Yanlan found odd jobs for everyone while organizing students to collectively review the lessons. Now, most students can recognize seven or eight hundred characters. Even Wang Shuzhen, whose grades were the worst, used to learn something one day and forget it the next. Zhao Yanlan helped her without complaining, and as a result, she also recognized more than three hundred characters. Many students can now write simple diaries and record work point accounts.

    Because Zhao Yanlan has made rapid progress in her studies, she is now in the third grade of the people's school. She said, "At this time last year, I was still an illiterate person, but this year I can barely read newspapers and write simple letters."

    She compares her past miserable life with the present: in the past, not to mention going to school and learning to read, she couldn't even take care of food and clothing. Now, she doesn't have to worry about food and clothing, and she can also study culture. She knows that all of this was brought to her by the Communist Party.

    What about the future? She said, "I am only twenty-three years old this year. After finishing the third grade, I will study for four more years. If I have culture, I won't have to worry about anything. In the future, I want to learn to drive a tractor and use new farm tools to cultivate the land!"

    Zhao Yanlan saw the bright future of the country and herself, and saw the good life in the future. It is precisely because of this that she has made progress in her studies and is active in her work.

　　学习模范赵彦兰
    阎承玉
    去年冬天松江省举行识字运动奖模大会的时候，赵彦兰光荣地被选为学习模范。今春，她又当选了生产模范、干部模范和军属模范。她是呼兰县完宝区二八井村的妇女主任，是共产党员。
    去年冬天政府号召办冬学时，她第一个带头报了名，并帮助不愿意上学的妇女解决困难问题，发动她们入学。
    她是学习小组长，每天都是头一个上学校去，扫地、点灯，把房子烧得暖烘烘的。谁不来，她就跑去招呼……。
    奖模大会结束以后，她想：“咱被选上模范了，以后就更应该好好带头，帮助大家学习啦。”一个月以后，她给省教育厅写了一封信，说：“我由省回来，就把开会的事和到年底认识一千字的学习任务传达了，大伙挺起劲，都订了具体计划……。我们分了十三个小组，每天一人学三个字。我们保证要把学习搞好。”
    为了适应生产，今夏她们把识字班改成地头小组时，有些妇女想不通：“要下地啦，活很忙那有空学习呀？”“冬天能学夏天那能学啊！”赵彦兰看到大伙有顾虑，就到各家去动员。在她的积极发动下，妇女学员便大大增加起来。
    春耕和夏锄，每天下地干活时，学员们都带着文化课本。赵彦兰一面干活一面督促大家：“大家快点干，到地头好学习字。今天学‘地要铲净’四个字。”休息时，学员们绕成一圈，由小先生教给字，有时还读报纸和“新农村”杂志给大家听。这样，许多以往不习惯于在地里学习的人也习惯了，说：“不耽误干活，不妨碍休息，字也能学会。”
    下雨天不能下地干活时，赵彦兰一边给大伙找零活干，一边组织学员集体复习课程。现在，一般学员都能认识七、八百字了。就是像成绩最差的王淑珍，过去老是头一天学会第二天就忘了，赵彦兰也不嫌麻烦地帮助她，结果也认得三百多字了。许多学员都已能写简单的日记，记变工账了。
    因为赵彦兰学习进步得快，现在已上民校三年级。她说：“去年这时我还是一个大字不识的睁眼瞎子，今年就勉强能看报纸，写简单信了。”
    她拿从前的苦日子和现在比：从前别说上学识字，连吃穿都顾不上，现在是吃穿不愁，还能学习文化了。她知道这些都是共产党给她带来的。
    将来呢？她说：“我今年才二十三岁，念完三年，再念四年，有了文化干啥都不发愁。以后要学习开拖拉机，用新农具种地！”
    赵彦兰看到了国家的和自己的光明前途，看到了将来美好的生活。也正因为这个，才使她的学习进步，使她的工作积极。
