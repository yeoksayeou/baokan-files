Miao Wanzeng, a farmer from Shizipo, Dongzhimen, said: "The US imperialist invasion of Korea is forcing soldiers to go, it is a paper tiger. The Korean People's Army, like our Liberation Army, is fighting for the people's liberation and emancipation, and the US imperialism will certainly be defeated." Wu Wenchang, a farmer from Shigezhuang, said: "US imperialism is destroying the safety and peace of the people of the world. Today, the power of the people of the world is strong, and it will certainly defeat it. I have decided to intensify production and support the liberation of Taiwan."
