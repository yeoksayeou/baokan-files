　　Commemorating the 23rd Anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day
    He Long
    It has been twenty-three years since the birth of the Chinese People's Liberation Army from the "August 1st" Nanchang Uprising. After twenty-three years of heroic struggle and arduous efforts, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Liberation Army has defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries' five million troops, fully supported by American imperialism, won the independence and liberation of our motherland, and made a great contribution to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.
    In the three great revolutionary wars of the past twenty-three years, the People's Liberation Army has experienced countless difficult and arduous roads, developed and grown strong under the guidance of Chairman Mao's military thought and army-building line, and trained itself into a heroic and good fighting, strong army that gradually mastered modern military science and modern technology. For the first time in history, the Chinese people have their own unified and powerful national defense force to defend the independence and freedom of their motherland and have formed an important force in the world peace camp.
    The reason why the Chinese People's Liberation Army has achieved victory is that from its birth, it was built under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant military thought and military line, and it was built under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. It is an army that is completely loyal and dedicated to the Chinese people, so the people love and support it and regard it as an army connected to them by flesh and blood. In the three revolutionary wars, it trained many new types of military commanders with both wisdom and courage, and countless revolutionary heroes. The People's Liberation Army soldiers understand that the purpose of their operations is to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to strive for the independence of the motherland and defend world peace. Therefore, they have demonstrated unprecedented heroism and self-sacrifice in combat. History has proven that such an army cannot be defeated.
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is not isolated in its struggle against internal and external reactionaries. We have the great ally of the Soviet Union, and the strength of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union is unprecedentedly strong. The Chinese people's liberation struggle and its success have aroused the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, who are on our side, while our enemies are increasingly isolated and increasingly fragile.
    Recently, American imperialism has frantically armed and invaded Taiwan and Korea, undermined the United Nations Charter, and threatened peace in the Far East and the world. This adventurous action by American imperialism will inevitably reap its own evil consequences. All officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are extremely indignant at this barbaric act of aggression and robbery by American imperialism. Our People's Liberation Army and the people of the whole country are determined to unite as one and fight to the end to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the American aggressors. The People's Liberation Army, which defeated the Japanese invaders and the American dog Chiang Kai-shek, will surely be able to defeat the American aggression and liberate Taiwan. We express our sympathy and respect to the Korean and Vietnamese people who are also suffering from American aggression and are carrying out victorious struggles of resistance. We firmly support the great national liberation wars of the Korean and Vietnamese people.
    The People's Liberation Army has accumulated rich experience in army building over the past twenty-three years, learned a complete set of the art of war, and created a strong national defense force. Before victory, the People's Liberation Army was the most important force in winning victory. After complete victory, the People's Liberation Army will be the most reliable pillar for consolidating victory, safeguarding the peaceful labor of our people, guarding our motherland, and defending world peace. Therefore, our most important task is to consolidate and strengthen the People's Liberation Army, improve the quality of the people's army, strengthen its combat effectiveness, and establish a modern national defense force. The People's Liberation Army, which has been trained and tested for twenty-three years, will certainly be able to shoulder its glorious historical mission.

　　纪念“八一”建军节二十三周年
    贺龙
    中国人民解放军自“八一”南昌起义诞生以来到现在已经二十三年了。经过了二十三年来的英勇奋斗与艰苦奋斗，人民解放军在毛主席和朱总司令的领导下，已经击败了美帝国主义以全力支持的国民党反动派的五百万军队，赢得了我们祖国的独立与解放，对远东与世界的和平事业有了极大的贡献。
    在二十三年来的三次伟大革命战争中，人民解放军经历了无数艰难困苦的道路，在毛主席的军事思想与建军路线的指导下发展壮大，并锻炼了自己成为英勇善战、逐渐掌握现代军事科学与现代技术的强大的陆军。中国人民在历史上破天荒第一次有了自己的统一的强大的国防军，来保卫自己祖国的独立与自由，并在世界和平阵营中形成了重要的力量。
    中国人民解放军之所以取得了胜利，是因为它从诞生的时候起，就是在毛主席天才的军事思想与军事路线的指导下建设起来的，是在中国共产党的领导下建设起来的，它是彻底忠实和献身于中国人民的军队，所以人民也就爱戴和拥护它，把它看作是与自己血肉相连的军队。它在三次革命战争中，锻炼出了许多新型的智勇兼备的军事指挥员，无数的革命英雄。人民解放军战士了解自己作战的目的是为了反对帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义，争取祖国的独立保卫世界的和平，因此，他们在作战中表现了空前未有的英雄气概与自我牺牲精神。历史证明，这样的军队是不可被战胜的。
    中国人民解放军在反对内外反动派的斗争中，并不是孤立的，我们有了伟大的盟友苏联，以苏联为首的世界和平阵线的力量是空前强大了。中国人民的解放斗争及其成功，引起了全世界爱好和平的人们的同情和拥护，他们是站在我们方面的，我们的敌人是日益孤立与日益脆弱了。
    最近美帝国主义疯狂地武装侵略台湾和朝鲜，破坏了联合国宪章，威胁了远东与世界的和平，美帝国主义这种冒险行动，必将自食其恶果。中国人民解放军的全体官兵，对于美帝国主义的这种野蛮侵略行动与强盗行为，是异常愤慨的。我人民解放军和全国人民一道，誓将万众一心，为从美国侵略者手中解放台湾而奋斗到底。战胜了日寇及美国走狗蒋介石的人民解放军，一定能够击败美国的侵略，解放台湾。我们对于同受美国侵略并进行胜利的反抗斗争的朝鲜人民与越南人民，表示同情和敬意。我们坚决声援朝鲜人民与越南人民的伟大民族解放战争。
    人民解放军在二十三年来积累了丰富的建军经验，学会了一套完整的战争艺术，并创造了强大的国防军。在胜利前，人民解放军是争取胜利的最主要的力量。在完全胜利以后，人民解放军又将是巩固胜利、保卫我国人民的和平劳动、警卫我们的祖国、保卫世界和平的最可靠的支柱。因此，我们最重要的任务，就是巩固与加强人民解放军，提高人民军队的素质，加强其战斗力，建立现代化的国防军。经过了二十三年的锻炼与考验的人民解放军，是一定能够担负起自己的光荣历史任务的。
