　　"We must support North Korea with practical actions and liberate Taiwan!"
    Letter to Chairman Mao from all employees of Tianjin Waterworks Company

　　Respected Chairman Mao:
    Since "July 7th" this year, we have responded to the call from our superiors: "Oppose the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and North Korea with practical actions and defend world peace." We have worked even harder in production competitions and overcome various difficulties and shortcomings. Warning signals were issued for individual project items that were difficult to complete, such as the water loss rate of the water transmission department, the power consumption rate of pressurized water supply at Well Water Plant No. 4, and the pipe laying project of the new construction project. Regarding the water loss rate, a liaison contract was established through special discussion meetings. Regarding the power consumption rate, engineers and workers put forward rationalization proposals using "Zhuge Liang Meetings." Regarding the difficulty of muddy ground due to rain in the pipe laying project, difficulties were overcome by using piling, pumping, and other methods. We achieved complete victory in the production competition movement from "May 1st" to "August 1st". Here, we report our achievements to you:
    The leakage rate was reduced by 19.3%, exceeding the target by 5%. The coal consumption rate for river water was reduced by 20.9%, exceeding the target by 12%. The power consumption rate for well water was reduced by 14.7%, exceeding the target by 13%. The total sales water unit cost was reduced by 19.2%, exceeding the target by 13.4%.
    The new pipe-making project in the Xibei River saved 46.5% of labor according to the original plan, exceeding the target by 37.4%.
    Safe water supply for the entire city was guaranteed (in some parts of the tenth district, the water pressure was too low due to a power outage at the North China Power Company in July, resulting in insufficient external water supply for less than an hour). The water quality was ensured to have no E. coli in 100CC, and there was no E. coli in the weekly test of 500CC, and the residual chlorine was increased to 0.1 parts per million.
    During the competition, scientific management systems such as cost planning, preliminary budgeting, materials, statistics, inspection, rewards, personnel attendance, and document processing were formulated, laying a good foundation for the implementation of quota management after the competition.
    During the competition period, 262 rationalization proposals were submitted to the factory, exceeding the quota by 62, and 54 new records were created, exceeding the quota by 4. Employees who submitted proposals accounted for 87% of all employees.
    Twenty-nine pairs of mentoring contracts were continuously signed, improving the skills of young workers. Eleven pairs of liaison contracts and eleven pairs of shift handover contracts were signed. The work connection between upper and lower processes and upper and lower shifts was strengthened. Four pairs of mutual assistance contracts were signed, strengthening the work connection between staff members, and the contract system was promoted.
    Regarding the cost reduction item, a total of 126,432 catties of millet were saved in May compared to before the competition, 233,100 catties of millet were saved in June compared to before the competition, and 289,684 catties of millet were saved in July compared to before the competition.
    We feel that these labor achievements are just a small contribution to our country. Although small, we still cherish it very much and will continue to develop and consolidate it.
    Chairman Mao, we assure you: We will do a good job in production. We have already formulated the production plans for August and September, and we are now learning to implement quota management in order to further improve the water conservancy construction of Tianjin.
    Chairman Mao, under your wise leadership for more than a year since liberation, we have been living happy days with stable prices and a secure life. But today, the American imperialists want to destroy our labor achievements, slaughtering millions of Korean people, and also want to stop us from liberating Taiwan, which is extremely hateful! We are determined to support North Korea and liberate Taiwan with practical actions, and overthrow American imperialism!
            All employees of Tianjin Waterworks Company

### “我们要以实际行动支援朝鲜，解放台湾！”  天津自来水公司全体职工上书毛主席

　　“我们要以实际行动支援朝鲜，解放台湾！”
    天津自来水公司全体职工上书毛主席
　　敬爱的毛主席：
    从今年“七七”那天起，我们响应了上级的号召：“用实际的行动反对美帝国侵略台湾朝鲜，保卫世界和平。”我们在生产竞赛中就更加劲了，克服了种种困难和缺点。对个别难于完成的计划项目，如输水科的耗水率，井水四厂加压送水的耗电率和新兴工程的铺管工程等，发出了警号。针对耗水率，利用专题座谈会订立联系合同；针对耗电率，由工程师和工人利用“诸葛亮会”提出合理化建议；针对铺管工程因阴雨使场地积水泥泞的困难，利用打桩、抽水等办法，克服了困难。我们在“五一”到“八一”这一段生产竞赛运动中得到了全部胜利。这里，向您报告一下我们的成绩：
    减低漏水率百分之一九·三，超出条件百分之五。减低河水耗煤率百分之二○·九，超出条件百分之一二。减低井水耗电率百分之一四·七，超出条件百分之一三。总售水单位成本降低百分之一九·二，超出条件百分之一三·四。
    西河制管新工程按原计划省工百分之四六·五，超出条件百分之三七·四。
    保证了全市的安全供水（十区部分地方，七月因华北电力公司停电，使水压过低，由外面供水不足一小时）。水的质量做到一百ＣＣ内无大肠菌，每周试验五百ＣＣ一次也无大肠菌，还使剩余的氯提高到百万分之○·一。
    在竞赛中制定了成本计划、预决算、材料、统计、检验、奖励、人事考勤、公文处理等科学管理制度，为竞赛结束后实行定额管理打下了良好的基础。
    在竞赛期内曾向厂方提出合理化建议二六二件，超出六二件，创造新纪录五四件，超出四件。提出建议的职工占全体职工的百分之八七。
    继续订立了师徒合同二十九对，提高了青工技术。订立了联系合同十一对，交班合同十一对。加强了上下工序和上下班的工作联系。订立了互助合同四对，加强了职员工作联系，推行了合同制度。
    至于降低成本一项，五月份比竞赛前共节约小米一二六、四三二斤，六月份比竞赛前节约小米二三三、一○○斤，七月份比竞赛前节约小米二八九、六八四斤。
    这些劳动的成绩，我们觉得不过是对自己国家的一点小小贡献。虽然小，但我们仍很珍贵它，要继续把它发展巩固下去。
    毛主席，我们向您保证：我们要把生产工作搞好。我们已订出了八、九月份的生产计划，现正在学习推行定额管理，以便进一步做好天津市的水政建设工作。
    毛主席，解放一年多以来，在您英明的领导下，我们已过着物价平稳，生活安定的快乐日子。可是今天美帝国主义者想要破坏我们的劳动成果，屠杀着千千万万的朝鲜人民，还想阻止我们解放台湾，真是可恶到极点！我们坚决要以实际行动，支援朝鲜，解放台湾，打倒美国帝国主义！
