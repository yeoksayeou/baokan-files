　　Closely Integrate Inspection Work and Start Rectification
　　Northeast Trade Department Inspects Trade Plans
　　Clarifies Understanding of Past Deviations and Formulates Improvement Measures
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily, the Northeast People's Government Trade Department, based on the Northeast Bureau's instruction to focus on solving key issues in the current trade work during the rectification, has begun to conduct rectification in conjunction with its work. It has initially resolved the issue of trade planning, clarified leadership thinking, and laid the foundation for strengthening trade planning in the future.
　　The department's rectification is led personally by the Minister of Trade, starting with bureau and division chiefs and managers of Northeast-level specialized companies. After document study and deliberation, it was determined that the rectification should primarily address four issues related to policy thinking and work style: 1. Trade planning; 2. Price policy; 3. The operational management and economic accounting of state-owned trade itself; 4. The relationship between public and private sectors.
　　The inspection of trade plans was the first priority, and it concluded in early August. The department's inspection revealed that deviations in policy thinking related to planning in trade work mainly manifested in the following three aspects:
　　Insufficient Research into Basic Conditions Leads to Inaccurate Trade Plans
　　1. The Trade Department did not conduct sufficient research into basic conditions in its work. When major changes occurred, it failed to grasp them effectively, resulting in inaccurate trade plans. For example, taking the grain purchase and sales plan, which is most important for urban-rural and domestic-foreign trade, as an example: last autumn, various regions underestimated the increase in grain production after land reform. Therefore, the state's grain purchase plan was set too small. As a result of farmers selling grain, the original plan was greatly exceeded, causing the state-owned trade's material and monetary supply plans to fail. Work became passive, and there were widespread shortages and incomplete varieties of goods. When the grain difficulties within the customs were basically resolved this spring, prices stabilized, and the market changed, the Trade Department did not conduct thorough research into the new situation or promptly propose improvements to grain work. In May, grain purchases were temporarily suspended, affecting agricultural production and urban-rural material exchange. Furthermore, when prices within the customs declined this spring, and the market changed, the department did not conduct timely and in-depth research. It did not fully recognize the impact of national market changes on the Northeast market. The amount of money to be sold, which was originally formulated based on an annual plan of a 20% increase in prices, should have been revised when the market changed and prices stabilized. However, the department did not revise it in time, resulting in the actual amount of money sold not meeting the planned requirements. The leadership still demanded that subordinates complete the tasks according to the original plan, which not only failed to complete the tasks but also created difficulties and deviations in the work of subordinates. This is also a major source of bureaucratism and commandism in the leadership style of the Trade Department.
　　After full discussion, it has been recognized that the current state-owned trade is facing the following situation: the state's planned economic construction has just begun, the national economic situation is complex and changing greatly, a vast free market exists, and the production and needs of small producers are difficult to accurately understand. Moreover, China's foreign trade is affected by several factors. Therefore, in the process of formulating and implementing trade plans in the future, it is necessary to have a greater understanding of these complex situations, strengthen research into various basic conditions and their development trends, and effectively grasp various major changes. The first is the investigation and research of urban-rural exchange and domestic-foreign exchange situations, as well as systematic investigation and research in conjunction with various departments on industrial and agricultural production and changes, urban and rural people's needs and changes, and urban and rural purchasing power and changes, as a basis for formulating and appropriately revising plans. This is the basic key to doing a good job in trade work. Based on such inspection and understanding, the Trade Department has decided to strengthen guidance in this area, replenish the investigation and research institutions of certain departments, and strengthen the organization and discipline in completing the state's trade plan.
　　Failure to Closely Connect Commodity Circulation Links
　　2. The Trade Department and its affiliated specialized companies did not fully consider the entire process of commodity circulation in the execution of plans. They failed to fully analyze and study the necessary conditions for completing the plans, making it impossible to connect the various links of commodity circulation, which affected the realization of the overall trade plan. Taking the example of the native product company purchasing live pigs and eggs: after determining the live pig purchase plan, there was a lack of a plan to connect with the reception and feeding of live pigs. After buying the pigs, there were no pig pens to raise them, resulting in a large number of deaths. There was a plan to purchase eggs, but there was no plan to build egg storage equipment, resulting in a large number of eggs deteriorating and rotting. Similar phenomena occurred in the business of other companies. As a result, trade work was passive, commodity funds were tied up, unnecessary losses and waste occurred, and the normal circulation and realization of the plan were hindered. The reason for these shortcomings is that the Trade Department lacked strict requirements, supervision, and inspection of these specific plans of its affiliated specialized companies. It did not promptly instruct various companies to study the laws of commodity circulation and the various conditions required to complete the plan.
　　The department proposed that in the future, trade organizations at all levels should strengthen the research of the entire process of commodity circulation, thoroughly analyze the various conditions required to realize each plan, and strengthen and promote the contract system between the various work links in the execution of the plan according to the requirements of the overall plan. Every commodity from procurement, transportation, reception, storage, processing, allocation, and sales should have a complete set of interconnected plans, and there should be a corresponding financial plan to adapt to it. This method should be used to overcome the serious phenomenon of inadequate planning in trade work.
　　The Existence of Simple Cash Recovery Thinking Leads to Deviations in Work
　　3. Poor cash planning and the existence of simple cash recovery thinking in the leadership: When inspecting the cash recovery plan, the department first affirmed that due to the requirements of price stability and the need for cash for industrial construction, the Trade Department should assume a certain cash recovery task. However, the size of the recovery task should be expressed by the total amount of money sold by state-owned trade minus the total amount of expenditure. It is the result of normal commodity circulation. Only on the basis of completing the commodity circulation plan can the recovery task be completed. However, in the past six months, the leadership's thinking has not sufficiently recognized this point. It has simply emphasized that subordinates must complete the recovery task. When the situation changed, the source of materials became a problem, prices stabilized, and the difference in recovery naturally decreased, the trade department did not actively propose appropriate revisions to the recovery plan and tried to expand the amount of money sold to ensure the completion of the plan through subjective efforts. The leadership's thinking did not sufficiently recognize the potential harm of simply emphasizing recovery, and therefore, it adopted excessively high demands on subordinates, which led to several deviations in the work. For example, the department store department adopted abnormal business methods to complete the recovery, selling goods that could be sold after a while at low prices, and state property suffered losses. Even in business operations, the scope was not properly defined, affecting the implementation of the policy of taking into account both public and private sectors, and making the Trade Department's own capital turnover difficult. For a period of time, the lack of cash caused the urban-rural exchange in the Northeast market to stagnate. The department has corrected the idea of simply emphasizing recovery since the third quarter.
　　After concluding the inspection of trade planning issues, the department made instructions on the preparation of the Northeast 1951 plan based on the spirit of combining inspection work with improvement work and began to inspect two other important issues in trade work - the relationship between public and private sectors and price policies.

　　密切结合检查工作开始整风
    东北贸易部检查贸易计划
    明确认识了过去偏差已拟订改进办法
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北人民政府贸易部，根据东北局关于整风应着重解决当前贸易工作中关键问题的指示，已开始结合工作进行整风，并初步解决了贸易工作的计划问题，使领导思想较前明确，为今后加强贸易计划性打下基础。
    该部整风系贸易部长亲自领导，从局处长和东北一级专业公司经理以上干部开始，经过文件学习及酝酿研讨，确定整风主要解决四个有关政策思想及作风问题。即：一、贸易的计划问题；二、价格政策问题；三、国营贸易本身的经营管理及经济核算问题；四、公私关系问题。
    首先检查贸易计划，八月初旬，已告一段落。该部检查结果，认为贸易工作中有关计划的政策思想问题所发生的偏差，主要表现在以下三方面：
    对基本情况研究不够贸易计划缺乏准确性
    一、贸易部对工作中基本情况研究不够，重大情况发生变化时又没很好的掌握，致使贸易计划缺乏准确性。如以关系城乡内外贸易最重大的粮食购销计划为例，去秋各地对土改后粮产增加估计不足，因此把国家购粮计划定小，而农民卖粮结果，大大突破原定计划，使国营贸易的物资及货币供应计划破产，工作被动，到处发生货物供应不及时及品种不全的现象。待今春关内粮食困难已基本解决，物价平稳，市场发生变化时，贸易部又未很好的研究新情况，未及时提出改进粮食工作的意见，五月间粮食一度停购，影响了农业生产及城乡物资交流。又如今春关内物价下降，市场起了变化，该部又未作及时深刻研究，没有充分认识到全国市场变化对东北市场所发生的影响，而原按全年计划物价上涨百分之二十来制订的卖钱额，本应在市场变化、物价平稳的情况下予以修改，但该部并未及时修改，致实际卖钱达不到计划要求，领导上却仍按原定计划要求下级完成任务，结果不但任务未完成，反而造成下级工作中的困难及偏差。这也是贸易部在领导作风上产生官僚主义、命令主义的主要来源。
    经过充分讨论后，已认识到：目前的国营贸易正面对着这样的情况：国家有计划的进行经济建设方在开始，全国经济情况复杂，变化很大，广大自由市场存在，小生产者的生产、需求不易做准确的了解，而中国的对外贸易又受若干因素的影响。因此，今后在制订与执行贸易计划过程中必需对这些复杂情况做更多的了解，加强对各种基本情况及其发展趋势的研究，并对各种重大情况发生变化时很好的掌握。首先是对城乡交流、内外交流情况的调查研究，以及结合各部门对工农业生产及变化、城乡人民需要及变化、城乡购买力及变化做系统的调查研究，以为拟定和适当修正计划的依据。这是做好贸易工作的基本关键。根据这样的检查及认识，贸易部已决定加强对这方面工作的指导，充实某些部门的调查研究机构，并加强对完成国家贸易计划的组织性纪律性。
    商品流转环节未能紧密衔接
    二、贸易部及所属专业公司在执行计划中对商品流转的全部过程考虑不周，未能充分分析研究完成计划的必备条件，使商品流转的各个环节不能衔接，致影响全盘贸易计划的实现。以土产公司采购活猪、鸡蛋为例：在确定活猪收购计划后，缺乏接收、饲养活猪相衔接的计划，买了猪没猪圈养，发生大批死亡现象。鸡蛋有了收购计划却没有建设储存鸡蛋设备的计划，以致发生大量鸡蛋变质、腐臭的事。其他公司业务中也有类似现象。因此使贸易工作被动、商品资金积压、发生不必要的损失浪费，妨碍了商品的正常流转和计划的实现。发生这些缺点的原因是贸易部对所属专业公司在这些具体计划方面缺乏严格的要求与监督检查，没有及时指示各公司研究商品流转的规律及完成计划所需的各种条件。
    该部提出今后各级贸易组织应加强对商品流通全盘过程的研究，周密分析每一项计划实现所需的各种条件，按照总计划的要求，在执行计划的各个工作环节间加强与推广合同制，做到每一项商品自采购、运输、接收、保管、加工、调拨、出销都有整套衔接的计划，并要有与之适应的财务计划。以此方法克服贸易工作计划不周的严重现象。
    存在单纯回笼思想致使工作发生偏差
    三、现金计划不周，领导上存在单纯回笼思想：该部检查现金回笼计划时首先肯定：由于物价稳定的要求和工业建设需要现金的要求，贸易部应担负一定的现金回笼任务。但回笼任务的大小，应由国营贸易卖钱总额减去开支总额来表现，它是商品正常流通的结果。只有在完成商品流转计划的基础上才能完成回笼任务。而半年来，贸易部的领导思想上对此点认识不足，单纯的强调下级必须完成回笼任务，并当情况变化、物资来源发生问题，物价平稳，回笼差额自然减少时，贸易部门亦未主动提出适当修改回笼计划，并在思想上企图以主观努力争取扩大卖钱额来保证计划的完成。在领导思想上对单纯强调回笼可能发生的危害性认识不足，因之对下级采取过高的要求，这就促使工作中发生若干偏差。如百货部门为了完成回笼采取了不正常的经营方法，把稍过一时即可销售的货物当做冷货贱价出售，国家财产受了损失。甚至在业务经营上未能规定相当范围，影响到公私兼顾政策的贯彻，且使贸易部本身资金周转不灵。在一个时期内，现金缺乏，使东北市场的城乡交流陷于停滞。该部自第三季度起已纠正了单纯强调回笼的思想。
    该部整风在结束了对于贸易计划问题的检查后，即根据检查工作结合改进工作的精神，作了关于编制东北一九五一年计划的指示，并开始对贸易工作中另两个重要问题——公私关系及价格政策问题，进行检查。
