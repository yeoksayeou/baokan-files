　　Korean Citizens' Organization Residing in Japan
    Sends Sincere Gratitude to Malik
    Expressing Solidarity with the Japanese People in Defending Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd dispatch from TASS] The Committee for the Defense of the Fatherland, formed by Korean citizens residing in Japan, sent a letter to Malik, President of the Security Council, stating: We, the 600,000 Korean citizens residing in Japan, extend our sincerest gratitude to you for your struggle, in your capacity as President of the Security Council, for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the defense of lasting world peace.

    Now, the imperialists, based on the completely illegal resolutions of the so-called Security Council, are carrying out blatant armed aggression against our motherland. The imperialists have even openly declared that atomic bombs should be used against Korea. These facts once again reveal that the imperialists are not only the enemies of the Korean people but also the enemies of all peace-loving countries in the world.

    The Committee for the Defense of the Fatherland pointed out: In Japan, "the imperialists and their loyal tool, the Yoshida government, are using blatant means of suppression to prepare Japan as a military base for armed intervention in Korea. The Korean people in Japan will spare no effort to assist in defending their motherland. We will fight to the end alongside the Japanese people for world peace."

　　侨居日本的朝鲜公民团体
    函马立克致真挚的感激
    表示将与日本人民并肩保卫和平
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社东京二十二日讯：侨居日本的朝鲜公民所成立的保卫祖国委员会致函安理会主席马立克称：我们侨居在日本的六十万朝鲜公民，向你致最真挚的感激之意，因为你以安理会主席的资格为和平解决朝鲜问题和保卫全世界的持久和平而斗争。
    现在，帝国主义者根据完全非法的所谓安理会的决议，向我们祖国实行了公然的武装侵略。帝国主义者还公开宣称，应该对朝鲜使用原子弹。这些，都再度揭示帝国主义者不但是朝鲜人民的敌人，而且是全世界一切爱好和平国家的敌人。
    保卫祖国委员会指出：在日本，“帝国主义者及其忠顺的工具吉田政府使用公然的镇压手段，是准备变日本为武装干涉朝鲜的军事基地。在日本的朝鲜人民将不遗余力地协助保卫他们的祖国。我们将与日本人民并肩为世界和平斗争到底。”
