　　Congratulations on Nazım Hikmet's Freedom
    By Marshak, translated by Chen Weiming
    Translator's Note: According to the Soviet Literary Gazette on July 19, Turkish revolutionary poet Nazım Hikmet has been released. "Nazım Hikmet is free!" This is indeed very exciting, and people all over the world who are fighting for peace and democracy will warmly cheer for this. As the newspaper pointed out, this is another victory for the camp of peace and democracy over the camp of imperialism and war. It can also be said that the wave of world protests against the Turkish reactionaries and their master, American imperialism, broke through the prison gates. Poet Nazım Hikmet is finally free! The newspaper also published a photo of Hikmet in prison in the past and a poem by the famous Soviet poet Marshak congratulating the poet on his freedom, which is specially translated here.
            ………Freedom
  Joyfully welcomes you at the door,
  And brothers give you a sword.
        ——Pushkin's Poem
    This clear moment's photograph
    Brings back memories of many years:
    The poet sitting inside this fence
    Has tasted the flavor of iron bars.
    This taste of iron bars is most familiar
    To the warriors who fight for their motherland.
    Following him are Ryleyev and Bestuzhev,
    Groaning in prison with shackles and manacles.
    Since Hikmet was thrown into prison,
    For twelve years he has not seen the vast fields,
    Twelve winters, twelve summers,
    Forced to separate from life.
    However, the weak and sick poet
    Becomes younger in his songs as before,
    Although the coldness of the prison
    Has clearly invaded his gray hair.
    Without announcement—arrest and imprisonment,
    This is the deed of unjust judges.
    Like an eagle with an injured chest,
    He walked out of the prison walls.
    He is free. But freedom
    Did not welcome him at the door.
    His country is still in slavery,
    Suffering from dumbness and inability to speak,
    Golden chains pull it
    Towards bloody war.
    If that bound zither
    We also hear its sound from the prison,
    How powerful and loud this sound is
    To defend the motherland and peace!
    Editor's Note: Regarding the protest of progressive cultural figures around the world against the long-term imprisonment of Turkish poet Hikmet, please refer to this journal on July 2. (Attached image)

### 祝拿瑞姆·希克梅特获得自由

　　祝拿瑞姆·希克梅特获得自由
    马尔夏克作  陈微明译
    译者志：据七月十九日苏联文艺报载，土耳其革命诗人拿瑞姆·希克梅特业已获释，“拿瑞姆·希克梅特自由了！”这确是令人万分兴奋的事，全世界为和平民主奋斗的人士将为此热烈地欢呼。正像该报所指出的，这是和平与民主阵营对帝国主义与战争阵营获得了又一次的胜利，也可以说，世界抗议土耳其反动派及其主子美帝国主义的暴行的浪潮冲破了牢狱的大门。诗人拿瑞姆·希克梅特终于获得了自由！该报并揭载了希克梅特过去在牢狱中的一张照片和苏联名诗人马尔夏克祝贺诗人获得自由的一首诗，兹特译载于此。
            ………自由
  在门口喜悦地接待着你，
  而兄弟们赠你以宝剑。
        ——普希金诗句
    这一目了然的瞬间的照像
    使人回忆起多年的往事：
    在这栅栏里面坐着的诗人
    饱尝了铁窗风味。
    对于为祖国奋斗的战士
    这种铁窗风味最为熟知。
    跟从着他的有雷列也夫与别斯多也夫
    带着脚镣手梏在狱中呻吟。
    希克梅特自从被投入牢狱
    十二年看不到辽阔的田野，
    十二个冬季，十二个夏季，
    被迫着和生活分离。
    可是，衰弱而有病的诗人
    像过去一样，在歌曲中变得年轻，
    虽然监狱的寒意
    显然地侵袭了灰白的头发。
    不经宣告——逮捕入狱，
    这是不公正的法官的勾当。
    好像一只胸部受伤的鹰，
    他走出了监狱的围墙。
    他——自由了。可是自由啊
    没有在门口接待他。
    他的国家也还在奴役中，
    它苦于哑吧似的不能说话，
    黄金的炼条拉着它
    奔赴血腥的战争。
    假如那被束缚的七弦琴
    从牢狱里我们也听到它的声音，
    这琴声是多么有力而嘹亮啊
    为了保卫祖国与和平！
