Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: After land reform in the Taihang Mountain region of Shanxi Province, rural productivity has seen a soaring development. Examples of the same land yielding nearly double the output of normal pre-war years are no longer considered miracles. Before the war, Xigou Village in Pingshun County produced 1.3 *shi* per *mu*; in 1949, it produced 2.1 *shi*. Before the war, Shili Village in Huguan County produced 1.28 *shi* per *mu*; in 1949, it produced 2.6 *shi*. Before the war, Huojia Yao in Licheng County produced 1 *shi* per *mu*; in 1949, it produced 1.9 *shi*. Before the war, Weijia Zhuang in Lucheng produced 0.6 to 0.7 *shi* per *mu*; in 1949, it produced 1.1 *shi*. 1949 was still a year of poor harvest due to lack of rain in the autumn.

The reason why output has increased so rapidly, the farmers in the Taihang Mountain region have summarized into a simple truth based on their own experiences: "The land has found its true masters."

Many liberated farmers still speak with great enthusiasm when they talk about that great land reform movement. When one farmer in Pingshun County was first allocated land, he led his whole family with lanterns in the middle of the night to caress the land that had never belonged to them. A strong desire for life and an unprecedented enthusiasm for production have grown universally among the vast number of farmers. "I want to turn poor mountains into rich mountains!" "I want to turn poor gullies into rich gullies!" Farmers who have gained the means of production use every possible way to work the land, and women, who account for half of the region's population, participate extensively in agricultural labor. Xigou Village in Pingshun is one of thousands of examples. Before land reform in the village, farmers could only apply 20 *dan* of fertilizer per *mu* per year and weed twice on rented land, but now they apply more than 100 *dan* of fertilizer per *mu* and weed four to five times.

Many simple agricultural science and technology that were previously considered impossible are now commonly used throughout the region. In Xiangyuan, Wuxiang, Heshun, Yushe, Pingshun, and Licheng counties, 72% of the wheat planted last year used warm water soaking. In Changzhi, Changzi, Huguan, and other six counties, 84% of farmers carried out field selection of seeds last year. Insecticides and new agricultural tools have begun to be used in some areas. The planting area of cotton, oilseeds, and other cash crops is expanding year by year. Li Shunda, a production model worker in Taihang, said: "In the past, it wasn't that people didn't want to cultivate the land as well as they do now, but where did the capital come from?"

### 土改后太行山区农村  生产力飞跃发展  不少地区产量超过战前近一倍

　　土改后太行山区农村
    生产力飞跃发展
    不少地区产量超过战前近一倍
    【新华社二十八日讯】山西太行山区经过土地改革以后，农村生产力获得了飞跃的发展。现在同样一亩土地，产量超过抗战前平常年景近一倍的例子，已不算奇迹。平顺县西沟村抗战前每亩产量一石三斗，一九四九年为两石一斗。壶关县十里村抗战前每亩产量一石二斗八升，一九四九年为两石六斗。黎城县霍家窑抗战前每亩产量一石，一九四九年为一石九斗。潞城魏家庄抗战前每亩产量六斗到七斗，一九四九年为一石一斗。由于秋天缺雨，一九四九年还是一个歉收的年景。
    产量所以增加得如此迅速，太行山区的农民根据亲身体会总结成了一条简单道理：“土地找到了自己的真正主人。”
    许多翻身农民谈到那个伟大的土地改革运动，至今犹眉飞色舞。平顺县有一家农民当最初分配到土地的时候，在深夜里带领全家打了灯笼一块一块地去抚摸那从来不属于自己的土地。一种强烈的生活欲望和空前未有的生产热情，从广大农民中普遍生长起来。“我要它穷山变富山！”“我要它穷沟变富沟！”获得了生产资料的农民用一切办法在土地上加工，占全区人口半数的妇女大量地参加了农业劳动。平顺西沟村是千万个例子中的一个。该村土地改革以前，农民在租来的土地上每亩每年只能施二十担肥料和锄两遍草，但现在每亩施肥在一百担以上，锄草多至四遍到五遍。
    过去认为不可能办到的许多简单的农业科学技术，现在已普遍使用于全区。襄垣、武乡、和顺、榆社、平顺、黎城六个县，去年种植小麦使用温汤浸种的占百分之七十二。长治、长子、壶关等六个县，去年有百分之八十四的农户进行了田间选种。杀虫药剂和新式农具，已经在部分地区开始使用。棉花、油籽和其他经济作物的种植面积逐年扩大。太行的生产模范李顺达说：“过去人们不是不想把地种得现在这样好，但是那里来本钱？”
