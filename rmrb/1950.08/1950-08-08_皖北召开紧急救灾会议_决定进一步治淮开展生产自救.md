Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th: The Anhui North District held an emergency meeting on production and disaster relief in Hefei from July 30th to 31st. The meeting was attended by heads of various special districts along the Huai River, cadres of the Administrative Office's directly subordinate organs, and Xu Kai, director of the Planning Committee of the Central Ministry of Water Resources, and Liu Chongguang and Wang Huzhen, both deputy ministers of the East China Military and Political Committee's Water Resources Department. Zeng Shan, vice chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, also made a special trip from Shanghai to attend. The meeting decided to further harness the Huai River in an organized and led manner, and to carry out a production and self-salvation movement in the disaster areas.

According to statistics reported at the meeting by the Fuyang, Suxian, Lu'an, and Chuxian special districts, the current flood-stricken area in Anhui North covers 28 counties, with over 31 million mu of cultivated land flooded. Among them, more than 22 million mu have yielded no harvest. In the flood-stricken areas, 890,000 houses have collapsed, and the number of disaster victims has reached more than 9.9 million, accounting for about one-half of the total population of Anhui North.

At the meeting, Deputy Minister Liu Chongguang reported on the basic situation of the Huai River, the water conditions, and the causes of the disaster, and put forward preliminary opinions on harnessing the Huai River. Zeng Xisheng, secretary of the Anhui North District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, put forward the future guidelines for production and disaster relief, which were discussed and approved by the meeting. The current policy for production and disaster relief in Anhui North is: to focus on rescuing disaster victims; to drain water to save seedlings and vigorously lead farmers to rush to plant and replant late autumn crops; to combine disaster relief with Huai River harnessing, using work as relief to aid disaster victims; and to organize disaster victims to engage in sideline production with production and sales conditions.

Zeng Shan, vice chairman of the East China Military and Political Committee, gave important instructions at the meeting. He said: The two major serious tasks facing the Party, government, army, and people of Anhui North are: disaster relief and water management. These two major tasks should become the main central work of the Anhui North People's Government and all the people. The serious disaster situation in Anhui North has a great impact on the construction work of the entire East China region, so the Military and Political Committee attaches special importance to it and will do its best to help the disaster-stricken compatriots in Anhui North. As long as the people's enthusiasm for production and water management is mobilized, under the leadership and support of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, and with the help of other liberated areas, the people of Anhui North will definitely be able to overcome this disaster. Chairman Mao is particularly concerned about the disaster-stricken compatriots in Anhui North, and the Central Ministry of Water Resources is studying the policy of fundamentally harnessing the Huai River, which provides an extremely important guarantee for our people in Anhui North to eradicate the scourge of floods. Vice Chairman Zeng pointed out that production and disaster relief should focus on calling on disaster victims to save themselves through production and should not solely rely on government relief. The most important task after the flood recedes is to lead the people in the disaster areas to immediately rush to plant and replant. The urgent task now is to quickly distribute relief grain to the disaster victims who urgently need relief. The central task for this winter and next spring is to mobilize the people to actively participate in water management projects that use work as relief. Finally, Vice Chairman Zeng especially requested cadres at all levels in Anhui North to continue their efforts to lead the people to overcome the famine through production and self-salvation.

　　皖北召开紧急救灾会议
    决定进一步治淮开展生产自救
    【新华社上海六日电】皖北区已于七月三十日至三十一日在合肥举行生产救灾紧急会议。参加会议的有沿淮河各专署负责人、行署直属机关干部、及中央水利部计划委员会须恺主任、华东军政委员会水利部刘宠光、汪胡桢两副部长。华东军政委员会曾山副主席也自沪专程赶往参加。会议决定：进一步有组织有领导地治好淮河，并开展灾区的生产自救运动。
    根据在此次会议上阜阳、宿县、六安、滁县等专区的汇报统计：目前皖北水灾区计二十八县，被淹耕地三千一百余万亩。其中颗粒无收者达二千二百余万亩。水灾区倒塌房屋八十九万间，灾民达九百九十余万，约占皖北全区人口的二分之一。
    在会议上刘宠光副部长报告了淮河的基本情况、水情和致灾原因，并提出治淮的初步意见；中共皖北区党委会书记曾希圣提出今后生产救灾的方针，均经会议讨论通过。皖北区生产救灾的当前方针是：着重抢救灾民；排水救苗和大力领导农民抢种补种晚秋作物；结合救灾治淮，以工代赈，救济灾民；组织灾民进行有产销条件的副业生产。
    华东军政委员会曾山副主席对会议作了重要指示。他说：摆在皖北党政军民面前的两大严重任务是：救灾和治水。这两大任务应成为皖北人民政府以及全体人民的主要中心工作。皖北的严重灾情对整个华东的建设工作影响是很大的，所以军政委员会特别重视，将尽力来援助皖北灾胞。只要把人民的生产、治水热情发动起来，在中央人民政府和华东军政委员会的领导与支援之下，加上其他解放区的帮助，皖北人民定能够克服此次灾难。毛主席特别关心皖北灾胞，中央水利部正在研究根本治好淮河的方针，这就使我们皖北人民对根除水患有了极其重要的保证。曾副主席指出：生产救灾应着重号召灾民生产自救，不能单纯依靠政府的救济。水退后最重要的工作是领导灾区人民立即抢种补种。现在的紧急任务是要把救济粮很快地散发到急需救济的灾民手里。今冬明春的中心工作，是动员人民踊跃参加以工代赈的治水工程。最后，曾副主席特别要求皖北各级干部，再接再厉地带领人民从生产自救中度过灾荒。
