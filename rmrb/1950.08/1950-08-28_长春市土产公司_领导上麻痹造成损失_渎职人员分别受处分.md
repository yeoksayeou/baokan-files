Changchun Native Produce Company
Leadership Paralyzed, Causing Losses
Derelict Personnel Disciplined Respectively

The Changchun Native Produce Company has chaotic operations, causing serious losses to state property.

Xie Jian'gu, the manager of the Changchun Native Produce Company, had no experience in the native produce business, but he was unwilling to learn humbly and consistently treated his work with a bureaucratic attitude, which led to chaos in the company's operations. The company's internal organizational structure is large, and the division of labor in each section is not clear. Both the Planning Section and the Business Section have investigation and statistics units. The Business Section has merchandise accounts, and the Accounting Section also has merchandise accounts, while the Transportation Section has not yet established storage accounts, only using notebooks to record numbers. There is a lack of planning in the work, and the sections are not connected. For example, when purchasing eggs, each section bought boxes and wood haphazardly, resulting in a surplus of 23,751 cubic meters of logs and 8,382 boxes, with a backlog of funds amounting to 2.5 billion (Northeast currency), which affected the business. The accounting work is also very chaotic, for example, the inventory is short twelve yuan of mink pelts compared to the books, and there are thirty-one more muskrat pelts. However, Manager Xie turned a blind eye to these chaotic phenomena.

There is also a lack of organization and discipline in the purchasing work. For example, after receiving the order to stop transporting pigs on March 3rd, there were already 241 pigs in stock. Not only did they not resolutely implement the order to stop purchasing, but they also did not strengthen the storage work. Coupled with the rainy weather, losses due to natural wastage, death from illness, trampling, and low-price sales amounted to more than 330 million yuan. In addition, the company even used the 589.8 million yuan of pigsty construction funds already approved by the higher authorities to build offices, resulting in the death of a large number of live pigs in stock.

Most of the company's existing fur and leather technicians are from the former "mountain running" profession. Because the leadership has not paid attention to strengthening the education and transformation of the technicians, they still collude with unscrupulous merchants, engage in corruption and bribery, and violate purchasing policies, buying mountain goods from unscrupulous merchants at high prices. According to preliminary statistics, the losses amount to 130 million yuan. When purchasing prices change, sometimes the retail departments are not notified, but private merchants already know. The most serious thing is that the company's leadership has been paralyzed for a long time, and the above-mentioned problems have not been dealt with in a timely manner. As a result, some technicians thought that corruption and dereliction of duty were not important, and they became bolder and more unscrupulous.

After inspection by the Changchun Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the company has been ordered to reorganize, and those who are corrupt and derelict in their duties will be given disciplinary action accordingly.

　　长春市土产公司
    领导上麻痹造成损失
    渎职人员分别受处分编辑同志：
    长春市土产公司业务混乱，使国家财产遭受严重损失。
    长春市土产公司经理谢戬谷，对土产公司业务本无经验，但又不虚心学习，一贯以官僚主义态度对待工作，使公司业务陷于混乱。该公司内部组织机构庞大，各科分工又不明确。计划科和业务科都设调查统计股，业务科有商品账，会计科也有商品账，而保运科迄今未建立保管账，只用笔记本记个数。工作缺乏计划，各科没有联系。如购鸡蛋时，各科乱买箱子、木料，结果剩余原木二万三千七百五十一立方米和箱子八千三百八十二个，积压资金达二十五亿（东北币，下同）之多，影响了营业。会计工作也很混乱，如库存比账面少十二张元皮，多三十一张香鼠皮。但对这些混乱现象，谢经理却熟视无睹。
    在收购工作上亦有无组织无纪律的现象。如三月三日接到停止运猪的命令以后，库存的猪已达二百四十一头，既不坚决执行停购命令，又没有加强保管工作，加上阴雨，便因自然损耗、病死、压死及低价出售损失计达三亿三千余万元。另外，上级已经批准的五亿八千九百余万元的修建猪圈费，该公司竟擅自用以修建办公室，结果使库存活猪大批死亡。
    该公司现有的皮毛技术员，多系从前“跑山行”的出身，由于领导上未注意加强对技术员的教育改造，他们仍与奸商拉拢，贪污受贿，并违反收购政策，以高价收买奸商的山货。据初步统计，损失一亿三千万元。收购价格变动时，有时尚未通知门市部，而私商却早已知道了。最严重的，是公司领导上长期麻痹，对上述问题都未及时处理，于是有的技术员以为贪污渎职也没啥要紧，更大胆、更放肆了。
    经长春市工商局检查后，已令该公司进行改组，对贪污渎职的人员，则分别予以处分。
