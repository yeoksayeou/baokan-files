　　Jinan Railway Machinery Plant Workers Display High Labor Enthusiasm, Successfully Completing Warehouse Inventory Work
    [This newspaper reported] The Jinan Railway Machinery Plant has successfully completed its warehouse cleanup work. The plant has been established for over forty years, but the warehouse materials have never been inventoried. No one knew how much stock was in the warehouse. The 660,000 square meters of factory space were littered with scrap iron and old materials. There were over 1,300 large train wheels alone, and the trees growing from the gaps in the wheels were as thick as two hands. Eight thousand tons of scrap were piled in the open air, exposed to wind and rain, and no one cared.

    On April 19th, the Jinan Railway Administration assigned the task of cleaning up materials. Most of the cadres lacked confidence. Some said, "The plant is so busy, it's impossible to complete the task while both taking inventory and not affecting operations." Others said, "It's possible to mobilize for voluntary labor, but the work is too heavy, the workers can't handle it." In response to this situation, the plant's general branch first convened a meeting of responsible cadres and party members at all levels within the plant. After unifying their thinking, the plant organized a cleanup committee headed by the plant director. Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League selected capable cadres to form an inspection team, and selected workers with prestige among the masses as inspection team leaders, responsible for supervision and inspection.

    On the 20th, the cleanup committee formulated a cleanup plan based on the plant's situation, dividing the entire plant into twenty-four work areas. The number of workdays was estimated for each work area, totaling 12,000 workdays. Manpower was appropriately allocated, and groups were formed by work area. Each group was required to divide responsibilities and help each other. A general meeting of all employees was also convened, where the plant director and general branch secretary gave mobilization speeches, explaining the importance of the cleanup work and calling on everyone to display their labor enthusiasm as masters of the plant, to not affect operations, to not spend a single grain of rice from the public, and to complete the task on schedule. The cleanup plan was also given to employees for discussion. Party and League also separately held meetings, calling on party and League members to not only take the lead in actively participating in the cleanup work, but also to persuade and mobilize the masses to ensure the completion of the cleanup task.

    After the work began, challenges were first launched between groups. Director Zhu, who was sixty years old, worked like everyone else; the public security team of the plant protection unit, the female nurses of the clinic, the primary school students of the Auxiliary Wheel School, and many employee family members all came to participate. A vigorous material sorting movement was launched throughout the plant. Employees generally gave up their days off. The Li Dechun group worked all night (without the leadership's prior knowledge) because the daytime transportation was congested. Female nurse Zhou Baofen broke her leg, but continued to sort materials while bleeding. The ten comrades of the plant protection unit transported thirty tons of pig iron over a long distance in one day. The 1,300 large train wheels of the materials group were all sorted at night. Comrades not only displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm, but also devised various methods to overcome the difficulties encountered at the time. The foundry group had a large number of people but a shortage of tools, so they created a flow-line operation method (people rest, tools don't). Old worker Shi Qingquan came up with a new method of loading vehicles, which saved labor.

    From April 23rd to May 13th, the plant's cleanup work was successfully completed. The twelve material warehouses were sorted out in an orderly manner. The names of various materials were noted, with cloth labels attached, indicating the quantity for inspection. Oils and paints were stored in the basement; soaps and yellow wax were placed in iron boxes to prevent rodents; wool fabrics were placed with mothballs, light-sensitive medicines were placed in colored bottles, and flammable and dangerous goods were stored separately. In addition, a used material yard and a scrap yard were opened, divided into cargo spaces and arranged neatly, with roads in the middle for easy transportation. Effective arrangement and reasonable storage were achieved.

    The plant's 1,713 people completed a total of 7,158 workdays, exceeding the original plan by 42 percent. Because the administration paid attention to the health of the employees and took good care of them, not a single worker became ill until the end of the cleanup work. (He Li)

　　济南铁路机厂职工发挥高度劳动热忱  胜利完成仓库清点工作
    【本报讯】济南铁路机厂胜利完成仓库清理工作。该厂从建立到现在已有四十多年了，可是仓库物资从来未清理过。库内有多少存货，谁也说不清。六十六万平方公尺的工厂里，遍地扔满了废铁旧料，单是大车轮子就有一千三百多个，从轮子隙中长出来的大树足有两手粗，八千吨废料堆在露天里，任其风吹雨淋，无人过问。
    四月十九日，济南铁路管理局布置清理物资工作，多数干部没有信心，有的说：“厂里工作这样忙，既要清点又要不影响业务，没法完成任务。”有的说：“义务劳动是可以发动，可是活太重了，工人受不了。”根据这种情况，该厂总支首先召集厂内各级负责干部党员开会，领导思想取得一致后，该厂组织了以厂长为首的清理委员会，党、政、工、团抽出得力干部组织了检查队，选拔群众中有威信的工人为检查队长，负责督促检查。
    二十日清理委员会根据厂内情况，作出清理计划，将全厂分为二十四个工区，按工区估计了工数，共计一万二千个工，适当的分配了人力，以工区组成小组。要求各组分工负责，互相帮助。并召集了全体职工大会，由厂长、总支书记作了动员，说明清理工作的重要，要求大家发挥主人翁的劳动热忱，不影响业务，不花公家一斤米，按期完成任务。并将清理计划，交给职工讨论。党、团内也分别召开会议，号召党、团员不但要以身作则积极参加清理工作，还要向群众说服动员，保证清理任务的完成。
    工作开始后，各组间首先发起了挑战，六十高龄的朱厂长，和大家一样干活；护厂所公安队员、诊疗所的女护士、扶轮学校的小学生和许多员工家属都来参加。全厂掀起了热火朝天的整料运动。员工普遍放弃了休班，李德春小组因白天搬运拥挤，三十人干了一夜（事先领导上不知道），女护士周保芬把腿碰破，淌着血还坚持整料，护厂所十个同志，一天搬运了长距离的三十吨生铁，材料组一千三百多个大车轮都是夜间整理的。同志们不但发挥了高度的劳动热忱，而且想出种种办法，克服当时遇到的困难。铸工组人多工具少，创造了流水作业法（人歇工具不歇）。老工友石清泉想出新装车法，节省了劳动力。
    从四月二十三日到五月十三日，全厂清理工作胜利完成，十二个料库被整理得有条不紊，各种材料名称，均加以注明，并附布签，注明数目，以便检查。油脂、油漆皆存入地下室；肥皂、黄臈等放进铁箱，以防鼠咬；毛线织品放樟脑，畏光药品放在有色瓶内，易燃危险品均隔离存放。另外辟有旧料场、废料场、分成货位、排列整齐，中间辟有马路，便利运送。做到了布置得法、保管合理。
    全厂一千七百一十三个人，共做了七千一百五十八个工，超过原来计划的百分之四十二。因为行政上注意了职工的健康，照顾得周到，直到清理工作结束，未累病一个工人。（何力）
