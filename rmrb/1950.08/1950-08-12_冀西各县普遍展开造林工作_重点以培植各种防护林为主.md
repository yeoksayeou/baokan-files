Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 9th—Afforestation work during this year's rainy season in the western Hebei counties has been universally launched in mid-July. The focus is on establishing protective forests in dry sandy wastelands and along river beaches, while also conducting a small amount of experimental mountain sowing and afforestation work. The work of cultivating windbreak, sandbreak, and flood control forest belts is focused on the three major sandy wasteland areas within the boundaries of the five counties of Xingtang, Xinle, Wuji, Zhengding, and Gaocheng: Shendao Beach, Lao Ci River, and Sha River breached embankment. It is estimated that the above five counties can afforest a total of 9,261 mu and plant more than 2.25 million trees. Tree species for afforestation: In sandy wasteland areas, small-leaved poplar, which is drought-resistant and has many parent trees, is the main species, with shrubs such as sour jujube and thorny pear as forest edge trees; along river areas, small-leaved poplar, willow, reed, and cogon grass are sown; and in mountainous areas, seeds such as Lespedeza bicolor, Vitex negundo, and Ailanthus altissima are sown. On July 15, the Western Hebei Afforestation Bureau dispatched 32 cadres to the above-mentioned key counties, combined with local county-level and below administrative cadres and afforestation models, to go deep into key districts and villages. Through joint village or village afforestation meetings, afforestation committees were established to mobilize the masses for afforestation. Then, various publicity methods were used to explain the people's government's afforestation policies to the masses and reward models of spring afforestation.

At present, the afforestation work of key trees has come to an end. In just three days, Beigaoli Village in Xingtang planted more than 45,000 windbreak networks, covering 270 mu of sandy wasteland. Huangjia Village in Xinle planted 14,000 trees in two days. The Western Hebei Sandy Wasteland Afforestation Bureau is now sending personnel to inspect the tree planting work in key villages in order to summarize the tree planting experience and promote it throughout the area.

　　冀西各县普遍展开造林工作
    重点以培植各种防护林为主
    【新华社保定九日电】河北西部各县今年雨季造林工作在七月中旬已普遍展开。其重点以干燥沙荒及沿河滩地设立防护林为主，同时进行少量试验性的山地播种造林工作。培植防风、防沙和防洪林带的工作则以行唐、新乐、无极、正定、藁城等五县境内的神道滩、老磁河、沙河破堤滩等三大沙荒地区为重点。预计以上五县共可造林九千二百六十一亩、植树二百二十五万余株。造林树种：沙荒地带以耐旱性强和母树较多的小叶杨为主，以酸枣、杜梨等灌木作林缘木；沿河地带播种小叶杨、柳、苇、荻等；山地则播种胡枝子、荆条、臭椿树等种。冀西造林局于七月十五日派出干部三十二名分赴上述各重点县，结合当地县以下行政干部及造林模范，深入各重点区、村，通过联村或村造林会议成立造林委员会，发动群众进行造林。然后，又采用各种宣传方式，向群众讲解人民政府的造林政策，奖励春季造林的模范。
    现在各重点树的造林工作已告一段落。仅行唐北高里村在三天内即植造防风林网四万五千多株，占沙荒地二百七十亩。新乐黄家村两天内植树一万四千株。冀西沙荒造林局现正派员检查重点村的植树工作，以便将植树经验加以总结，推广全区。
