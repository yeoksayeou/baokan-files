    Tractors on the Grassland
    By Our Special Correspondent Tian Liu

    How big is the North Manchurian grassland? I still don't know. Anyway, taking the train north from Shenyang, passing through Siping into Heilongjiang Province, through Qiqihar all the way to Bei'an, or northeast after Siping, speeding through the entire Jilin Province into Songjiang Province, crossing the Mudanjiang River all the way to Jiamusi, the train is always running on the endless grassland. Sometimes, you can't see any sign of human habitation for an hour.

    In July, I took the Harbin-Bei'an train north. The train attendant, in order to give passengers a comfortable and pleasant journey on the boundless grassland, constantly played various melodious records and songs: "The East is Red," "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," and the Soviet "Fatherland March." The resounding song of "Our motherland is so vast, she has countless fields and forests" made people feel open-minded and happy, yearning for the future of the grassland: everywhere growing fertile grains, galloping countless cattle and sheep, and building new towns and villages.

    After a night of galloping, the train passed through Tongbei County Station on the morning of the second day, and suddenly a golden expanse appeared before my eyes. The passengers crowded to the windows, looking at the sea of wheat, happily announcing: We are almost at Zhao Guang Station. Look at the wheat of the farm, what abundant wheat! The summer breeze gently blows, and only then can you see the crowds working in the wheat fields to remove different seedlings. On the far side of the wheat field, tractors are rumbling forward on the grassland. The speeding train stopped at Zhao Guang Station next to rows of milky white and beige houses of the Tongbei Mechanical Farm. Many passengers swarmed off the train, all of them farmers along the railway line, temporarily participating in summer hoeing work at the farm. All these scenes show that the grassland is under construction, the grassland has become fertile land, and new farms have begun to appear on the grassland.

    During the puppet Manchukuo period, the enemy had set up a "Pioneering Corps Training School" here, attempting to reclaim the fertile grassland around it. Because they were all "laborers" captured from various places, everyone resisted, delayed, loafed, and sabotaged in various ways, without achieving anything significant. After the entire Northeast was liberated on August 15th, it went through two years of liberation war. When the People's Government sent Comrade Zhou Guangya to establish a farm in the winter of 1947, this place had long been destroyed, lacking everything: only a few bare walls remained of the houses, without roofs, doors, or windows; everywhere was white with snow, the ice and snow over the knees, not even a place to live. During the New Year, Zhou Guangya and three other comrades squatted on the manure in the stable and ate a meal of dumplings, sending off the New Year's Eve of 1947 and welcoming 1948. None of the three were intimidated by the difficulties. First, they recruited more than ten car drivers in Qiqihar City as "technicians" to drive tractors; then, they recruited more than fifty young students from Hulan and Shuangcheng middle schools in Songjiang Province to "learn to drive tractors" at the farm. But at that time, no tractors had been transported, here was only white snow, cold wind, and dilapidated walls. They went to remote places to cut thatch, built roofs that "wind can enter but snow cannot," and searched for broken farm tools left by the enemy in the deep snow, often spending a great deal of effort to dig through the deep snow and ice to find a plow or a plowshare, even these were missing parts and could not be assembled, so they could not be used. But they still persisted, repaired, and searched.... In April, the earth returned to spring, and the snow slowly began to melt. When spring plowing was about to begin, tractors purchased from the Soviet Union were transported in. What beautiful tractors! But new difficulties arose: more than fifty young students had just put down their books, how could they drive tractors? For more than ten old car drivers, if they were driving cars on straight asphalt roads in the city, turning right and left, it was simply handy and free to maneuver, but driving a tractor on the grassland to reclaim wasteland was a different story. The farm director—the old warrior who had fought the Japanese invaders on the North China battlefield for a full ten years with a gun in his hand, he was sure that not even the cleverest enemy could escape if he were to organize a large attack involving thousands of people, but now these fifty or sixty "grassland builders" made him flustered. There were many difficulties, and they needed to be overcome one by one. In the past three years, they really overcame them one by one. Now, Tongbei Farm has become a large-scale mechanized farm.

    This year, the planting area of Tongbei Farm has reached 30,000 mu. The lush 11,000 mu of wheat is already taller than the chest; more than 15,000 mu of soybeans, like well-nurtured children, are plump and healthy; nearly 4,000 mu of other grains are also growing well. Now, Tongbei Farm has established thirteen work stations and one branch farm, and a 500-mu crop experimental area in addition to its own farm. The farm now has thirty-two Stalin tractors, totaling 1,700 horsepower, sixteen Ford and Farmall tractors, twenty combines, twenty 24-row seeders, and more than 300 other farm implements such as disc harrows, harvesters, and threshers. It has also established its own farm machinery repair shop. In the past three years, it has trained more than 200 new tractor drivers, of which 40 outstanding drivers have mastered all the knowledge and skills of driving and repairing, and nearly 100 have become skilled drivers. The more than sixty new trainees recruited this spring were also able to drive and plow independently in the July wasteland reclamation.

    Director Zhou led me to visit the work station more than 20 li away. There, three tractor teams were reclaiming "summer fallow." They wanted to use the gap between spring plowing and wheat harvest to reclaim 70,000 mu of wasteland. From June 1st to July 10th, they had completed 63,000 mu, and they would complete the task in another three or four days. On the way, Director Zhou told me: Among the more than sixty students recruited this spring, there are sixteen female students. Like the male students, they were also assigned to various tractors to learn in practice. In the short four or five months of spring plowing and summer hoeing, they have all learned to drive. Now, they are opening up the summer grassland with the male students.

    A row of tents is set up on the distant grassland, which is the temporary residence of the tractor team members. During the wasteland reclamation time, in order to save travel time and fuel, each tractor team stays on the grassland with tents. When I went to visit, many people were sleeping—in order to complete the task of reclaiming 70,000 mu before the wheat harvest, they worked in two shifts day and night continuously, and now it was time for the night shift to rest. Only one female comrade was lying in the small tent next to her reading a book. When she saw us, she laughed and shouted, "Director, look how bad the doctor is, he won't let people go to the field." She was having chickenpox, and there were still many marks on her arms. The director told me that her name was Liu Ying, she was only sixteen years old this year, and she was a student at Beijing No. 3 Girls' Middle School. Inspired by the heroic deeds of Liang Jun, the first female tractor driver in New China, she came to the farm this spring with another female classmate to learn to drive a tractor. You can't tell that she is a "female student" at all. Although she is sick, her red-black healthy face, her bare feet, and her pair of strong and round calves are completely like a simple and healthy rural girl. I asked her how life here is compared to school? She laughed, her face as red as a flower: "School is good—here is even better." Because she is young, loves to talk, laugh, and sing, people call her Little Liu. She excitedly said: "Look, our room is full of all kinds of flowers and plants, and in front of the door is the boundless grassland. As soon as we walk over, the grassland immediately turns into fertile land..."

    More than twenty tractors are rumbling forward on the grassland. The female tractor drivers, like the male tractor drivers, are driving the steel horses and skillfully shaking the plows. The green grassland rolls and turns like waves; the brown fertile soil sees the sun for the first time, releasing a fresh earthy fragrance. In the blink of an eye, the green grassland turns into neat and tidy rectangular fields.

    Two years ago, when the tractor first appeared on this vast wilderness, it caused a sensation throughout the grassland. Farmers came from far away to see this "fire plow." They touched the tractor, cheered and followed the tractor, calculating how much land it could plow in a day. Some even squatted down and measured the depth of its plowing with their hands, asking the drivers all kinds of questions. The steel horse answered all the questions of the villagers with its own actions: How much wasteland can two farmers plow in a day with a wooden plow pulled by six horses? About twelve mu, but a Stalin No. 3 tractor with a five-bottom plow can plow 90 to 120 mu in a day, which means that tractor reclamation is seven to ten times faster than two people with six horses. The plowing depth of the tractor is 50% to 100% deeper than horsepower. When sowing, three or four farmers can only plant 15 mu a day with three horses, while a tractor can sow more than 400 mu a day, some even reaching 700 mu, which is 30 to 45 times faster than manual sowing. What about harvesting in the fall? Four or five farmers can only harvest ten mu of crops a day while bending over, and then two horses are used to pull it to the threshing ground, and then three horses and two people are needed to complete the threshing; the farm uses a combine to harvest, thresh, winnow, and bag at the same time, and can thresh 180 mu a day. Now, there are more than 360 employees in Tongbei Farm. This year's net income—excluding all expenses such as seeds, fuel consumption, machine repair and depreciation, and employee salaries—can be 10 billion Northeast currency. On average, each farm employee produces a net profit of 27 million yuan. How much net profit can a farmer using old-fashioned farm implements get from the land in a year? This year, the farm reclaimed another 70,000 mu, and next year the planting area will reach 100,000 mu, and only 150 more people will be needed. How many times will the income increase? No wonder the Northeast farmers, who have abolished the feudal exploitation of the land system and completely realized land reform, have such urgent expectations for machine farming! Last year, all the farmers in two villages in Heilongjiang Province jointly wrote to the Northeast People's Government Mechanical Farm Administration, requesting to purchase tractors. Although the conditions are not yet available, the farmers are still managing small plots of land in a dispersed manner, and they cannot use modern machine farming, but the farmers hope, expect, and firmly believe that that day will come. Therefore, when improved farm tools and new-style animal-powered farm machines—Western plows, combined weeding machines, harvesters, etc.—appeared this year, farmers quickly bought more than 60,000 units. Today, many farmers in the Northeast have begun to separate from cattle and horses, and can also sit on the seat of Western plows and wave their whips forward.

    Now, Tongbei Farm has its own club, library, clinic, bathhouse, barber shop, and cooperative; in the evening, its own small power plant makes the electric lights of the whole farm bright; large orchards are also being cultivated. Before leaving, the director warmly invited me: "Come and eat apples in three years!"

    There are twelve such farms in the entire Northeast region. The liberated farmers have seen their happy future from these farms.

　　草原上的拖拉机
    本报特派记者  田流
    北满草原究竟有多大？我还不知道。反正从沈阳乘火车北行，经四平入黑龙江省过齐齐哈尔一直到北安，或者过四平后东北行，驰过吉林全省入松江省，跨过牡丹江直到佳木斯，火车总在漫漫的大草原上奔驰。有时，一个钟头也看不见人烟。
    七月，我乘坐哈尔滨——北安路火车向北驰行，列车员为着使乘客们在无际的草原上有个安适愉快的旅行，不时的播送着各种悦耳的唱片和歌曲：《东方红》、《兄妹开荒》、苏联的《祖国进行曲》。那嘹亮的“我们祖国多么辽阔广大，她有无数田野和森林”的歌声，更使人胸怀开朗、心神愉快，向往着草原的明天：到处生长着肥硕的谷物，奔驰着无数的牛羊，兴建起新的城镇与乡村。
    经过一夜的奔驰，第二日清晨火车过通北县车站后，忽然眼前呈现一片金黄。旅客们都拥挤到窗前，望着那麦的海洋，欢告着：快到赵光车站了。看农场的小麦，多么丰茂的小麦啊！夏风轻轻吹过，才看得见正在麦田中进行拔除异株工作的人群。在麦田的遥远的那边，拖拉机正在草原上隆隆前进。奔驰着的火车停在通北机械农场一排排乳白色的、米黄色的房舍旁边的赵光车站上。众多的旅客们蜂拥下车，他们都是沿铁路线的农民，到农场临时参加夏锄工作的。这种种景象表明：草原在建设中，草原已变成良田，新的田庄也开始在草原上出现了。
    伪满时代，敌人曾在这里设立过“开拓团训练校”，企图开垦这周围的肥沃草原。因为都是从各地抓来的“劳工”，谁都用各种办法抗拒着、拖延着、怠工和破坏着，没干出什么名堂来。“八一五”东北全部光复后，又接连经过了两年解放战争。到一九四七年冬天，人民政府派周光亚同志来建立农场时，这地方早被破坏的要啥没啥了：房子只剩下光秃秃的几堵墙，没了屋顶也没有门窗；到处白雪茫茫，冰雪过膝，连个住的地方也没有。过年时，周光亚等三个同志蹲在马棚的粪土上吃了一顿饺子，送走了一九四七年的除夕，迎接了一九四八年。他们三人可谁也没有被困难吓倒，首先在齐齐哈尔市招聘了十多名汽车司机，作为开拖拉机的“技术人员”；又在松江省呼兰、双城两个中学里招了五十多名青年学生，来农场“学开拖拉机”。可是那时还没有拖拉机运到，这里只有白雪、寒风、颓垣断壁。他们到老远的地方去割毛草，盖起“风进雪不入”的屋顶，又在深雪中寻找着敌人丢下的破农具，常常费了九牛二虎之力扒开深雪、冰冻，才能找到一张犁，一片铧，就是这也都是缺手没脚按不到一起，不能用。但他们仍然坚持着、修建着、寻找着……。四月，大地回春，雪慢慢的开始融化，快要开始春耕的时候，从苏联购买的拖拉机运来了。多么漂亮的拖拉机啊！可是新的困难又来了：五十多名青年学生刚放下书本，那里会开拖拉机？十多名老汽车司机要是在城市里笔直的柏油马路上开着汽车奔驰，右旋左转，简直是随心应手，操纵自如，但在草原上驾起拖拉机开荒，却“隔着一路”。场长——这位拿着枪在华北战场上同日本侵略者周旋了整整十年的老战士，要叫他组织千百人的大进攻，保险狡猾的敌人一个也跑不了，现在这么五、六十个人的“草原建设者”却使他手忙脚乱了。困难很多，需要一个一个去克服，三年来，他们也真的一一克服了。现在通北农场已经是一个规模宏大的机械化的农场了。
    今年通北农场的播种面积已达三万亩。那繁茂的一万一千亩麦子已高过胸际；一万五千多亩大豆，像养育得极好的孩子，棵棵肥头大耳；近四千亩其他谷物也生长得很好。现在通北农场除本场外，已建立起十三个作业站和一个分场，一个五百亩的作物试验区。全场已拥有斯大林号拖拉机三十二台，共一千七百马力，福特、法尔毛等拖拉机十六台，康拜因机（联合收割机）二十台，二十四行播种机二十台，其他如圆盘耙、收割机、脱谷机等农具机三百余台，还建立起自己的农机具修理工场。三年中已培养出二百余名新的拖拉机手，其中有四十名优秀的驾驶员已掌握起驾驶和修理的全部知识和技术，近百名已成为熟练的驾驶手。今年春天招收的六十多名新学员，在七月份开荒中，也能单独开车、摇犁了。
    周场长领我到二十里以外的作业所去参观。那里有三个拖拉机中队正在开“伏荒”，他们要利用春耕到麦收的空隙时间开七万亩荒地，从六月一日开始到七月十日已完成六万三千亩，再过三、四天就要全部完成任务了。路上，周场长告诉我：今年春天招收的六十多名学员中有十六位女学员。她们和男学员一样，也被分配在各个拖拉机上实际学习，在春耕、夏锄的短短四、五个月中，已都学会驾驶了。现在，她们正和男学员在一起开拓着夏日的草原。
    远远的草原上，搭起一排排的帐篷，这是拖拉机队员们的临时住所。在开荒时间，他们为了节省往返的时间和燃料，各个拖拉机队都带着帐篷住宿在草原上。我去参观的时候，许多人正在睡觉——为着麦收前完成七万亩的开荒任务，他们分日夜两班连续工作，现在正是夜班休息的时候。只有一个女同志躺在旁边的那个小帐篷里看书。她见了我们，就笑着嚷起来：“场长，你看医生多不好啊，硬不叫人家下地。”她正在出水豆，手臂上还有不少斑痕。场长告诉我她叫刘瑛，今年才十六岁，北京第三女中的学生。因为被新中国第一个女拖拉机手梁军的英雄事迹所鼓舞，今年春天和另一位女同学来农场学开拖拉机。简直看不出她是一个“女学生”了，虽然她正在生病，那红黑健康的脸孔，那赤裸着的双足和一对矫健浑圆的小腿，完全是个朴素健康的农村姑娘。我问她现在的生活比学校里怎样？她笑起来，脸红得像一朵花：“学校好——这里更好。”因为她年岁小，爱说爱笑爱唱歌，人们都叫她小刘。她奋兴地说：你看，我们屋子里都长着各种各样的花草，门口前面就是无边的大草原。我们一走过去，草原立时就变成了良田……。”
    草原上二十余台拖拉机正在隆隆前进。女拖拉机手和男拖拉机手们一样，有的驾驶着钢铁的马驰行，有的熟练的摇着耕犁。翠绿的草原像波浪似的滚滚翻转；那褐色的沃土第一次见到了阳光，放散着新鲜的土香。转眼间那绿色的大草原就变成了整整齐齐一块块长方形的良田。
    两年前，当拖拉机第一次出现在这辽阔的原野上的时候，轰动了整个草原。农民们从很远的地方前来，以便看看这“火犁”。他们抚摸着拖拉机，欢呼着跟着拖拉机跑，计算着它一天能耕多少地。有的还蹲下来用手量着它耕的深度，向驾驶员们询问着各种问题。钢铁的马用自己的行动回答着老乡们的全部问题：两个农民用六匹马拉着的木犁一天能开多少荒呢？大约是十二亩，但带着五铧犁的斯大林三号拖拉机一天能开九十亩到一百二十亩，就是说拖拉机开荒比两个人力六匹马力加快了七到十倍。拖拉机耕的深度比马力加深百分之五十到一倍。播种时三、四个农民用三匹马一天只能种十五亩，拖拉机一天能播四百亩以上，有的竟达七百亩，比人力播种加快了三十倍到四十五倍。秋天收割的时候怎样呢？四、五个农民弯腰曲背的一天只能割十亩地的庄稼，而后要用二匹马把它拉到打谷场，再用三匹马力两个人工才能打完场；农场用康拜因机连割带打当时扬风装袋一天能打一百八十亩。现在通北农场全场职工共有三百六十多人。今年的纯收益——除去种子、油料消耗、机器修理和折旧以及职工薪资等一切开支，可获东北币一百亿元。平均每个农场职工生产纯利二千七百万元，用旧式农具耕作的农民，一年能向土地要多少纯利呢？今年该场又开荒七万亩，明年播种面积将达十万亩，人员只要增加一百五十个人就足够了。那收益将增加多少倍呢？难怪废除了封建剥削的土地制度，彻底实现了土地改革的东北农民，对于机器耕作的期望是那样的迫切！去年黑龙江省两个农村的全体农民，曾联名上书东北人民政府机械农场管理局，要求购买拖拉机。虽然现在条件还不具备，农民们还是分散的经营着小块小块的土地，还不能使用近代化的机器耕作，但农民们希望着、期待着、坚信着那一天总会到来。所以当今年改良农具和新式的畜力农具机——洋犁、联合锄草机、收割机等出现的时候，农民们很快的就买了六万多台。如今东北不少农民已开始和牛马分离，也可以坐在洋犁座上扬鞭前进了。
    现在，通北农场有了自己的俱乐部、图书馆、医疗所、澡塘、理发馆和合作社；入晚自己的小发电厂又使全场的电灯明亮起来；大的果树园也在栽培着。临别时，场长热情的邀我：“三年后来吃苹果啊！”
    东北全区已有十二个这样的农场。解放了的农民，从这些农场亲眼看到了自己幸福的将来。
        一九五○、八、五。
