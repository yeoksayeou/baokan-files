　　Mancheng County Party Committee Deputy Secretary He Luofeng
    Backward Thinking and Superstitious Beliefs in Ghosts and Gods

To the Editor:

　　I recently took leave to return to my hometown of Mancheng and stayed at home for seven days, during which I discovered some problems. I am writing them down now, hoping that the relevant departments will resolve them.

　　Comrade He Luofeng, Deputy Secretary of the Mancheng County Party Committee, is from Xiyuanpo Village in the county. Regarding him, the villagers in the nearby villages have been spreading these sayings: "Who dares to offend He Luofeng of Popo Village? He is a big official!" "There is an old earth god in heaven, and He Luofeng on earth!" The following are the facts of his personal actions that have caused dissatisfaction among the masses. During the liquidation and revenge movement in 1946, he took several mu of land from the 40 mu of land that had been taken back from Tian Luohe's home in Xuncun; during the re-examination, he sold seven mu of the land that had been excessively seized (a total of about 20 mu were distributed during the land reform). Soon after, he sold another three mu. He used some of the money from the sale to provide for his lazy and gluttonous wife. When the floating property was distributed in the village, he also selected two or three items from the 46 piles of clothing that had been divided and pocketed them, causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

　　What is even more ridiculous is that as a Deputy Secretary of the Communist Party County Committee, he should be an atheist and should fight against feudal superstition. However, not only does he not oppose feudal superstition, but he also supports and actively promotes it. The following is a specific fact: After the land reform, his family moved into the newly distributed house. His wife often fell ill, and she said that the sick ghost was following him. So he went to Daguodian to invite a feng shui master to come and personally lead him around the village. After the feng shui master "instructed" him, he demolished a room from the west side of his new house, and also removed the millstone. Later, his illness did not improve, so he demolished the pigsty of another family. However, his wife's illness still did not get better. Recently, he has chosen a good date and is preparing to move. Can Comrade He Luofeng's ideology and work style meet the requirements of a Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee? I hope that the Mancheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China can help Comrade He Luofeng correct his mistakes, so as not to cause a bad influence on the Party among the masses.

Editor's Note: We once sent this letter to the CPC Baoding Prefectural Committee for investigation. Recently, we received investigation materials from the Baoding Prefectural Committee and the Mancheng County Committee of the CPC regarding Comrade He Luofeng's issues, which confirmed that the facts reflected by the reader were basically correct.

　　Comrade He Luofeng is a Communist Party member and one of the Party's leaders in the county, but his selfish behavior in daily life has caused dissatisfaction among the local masses and damaged the Party's prestige among the masses. At the same time, and more seriously, he actually believes in ghosts and gods. This is completely incompatible with the thought of Marxism-Leninism. The decision of the Mancheng County Committee of the CPC to convene a county committee meeting to help Comrade He Luofeng conduct an ideological review is completely necessary. At the same time, it is hoped that Comrade He Luofeng will also conduct a good review of his own thoughts, and in the future strengthen his theoretical study of Marxism-Leninism, improve his ideological level, and better serve the people.

### 满城县委副书记何洛丰  思想落后迷信鬼神

　　满城县委副书记何洛丰
    思想落后迷信鬼神编辑同志：
    我最近请假回满城故里，在家住了七天，发现了一些问题。现在把它写在下面，希望有关部门予以解决。
    中共满城县委副书记何洛丰同志，是该县西原坡村人。对于他，这里附近的村庄老乡们流传着这样几句话：“谁敢得罪坡上的何洛丰，人家是大官！”“天上有老地爷，地下有何洛丰！”下面就是他个人所做的引起群众不满意的事实。在一九四六年清算复仇运动中，他从逊村田洛贺家中算回的四十亩土地中分了几亩；复查中他就把清算多得的土地出卖七亩（土改时一共分了二十亩左右）。不久就又出卖三亩。把一部分出卖的钱供给他的好吃懒做的妻子。在该村分浮财时，他又从分好的四十六堆衣物中间选出二件至三件私吞了，引起了群众的不满。
    更可笑的是，作为一个中共县委副书记，应该是一个无神论者，他应该和封建迷信作斗争。但他不但不反对封建迷信，反而拥护与积极提倡迷信。下面就是一个具体事实：土地改革后，他们一家搬到分得的新房里去住，他妻经常生病，便说病鬼跟上他了。就去大固店把看阴阳的先生请来，亲自领着他在村中看了一遍。经阴阳先生“指教”后，把他新屋的西房拆去了一间，碾子也拆去。后来病还是不好，就又把别人家的猪圈也拆掉了。可是妻子的病依然未好。最近又看好日期，准备搬家。像何洛丰同志这样的思想作风，难道够得上县委副书记的条件吗？我希望中共满城县委会能够帮助何洛丰同志改正他的错误，以免引起群众对党的不良影响。

    编者按：这封信我们曾经送请中共保定地委调查。最近我们收到保定地委及中共满城县委关于何洛丰同志问题的调查材料，证实了读者所反映的事实基本上是正确的。
    何洛丰同志是共产党员，又是该县党的领导人之一，但他在日常生活中所表现的自私自利的行为，引起了当地群众不满，并使党的威信在群众中受到损失。同时，严重的是，他竟迷信鬼神。这与马克思列宁主义的思想是完全不相容的。中共满城县委决定召开县委会议，帮助何洛丰同志进行思想检查，是完全必要的。同时希望何洛丰同志亦应很好的检讨自己的思想，并在今后加强马列主义的理论学习，提高自己的思想水平，更好的为人民服务。
