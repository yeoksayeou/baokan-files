　　Qingdao Sixteen Dyeing and Printing Factories
    Complete Processing Contract
    [Qingdao News] Qingdao Daily News: The Qingdao Municipal Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company entrusted the city's sixteen dyeing and printing factories to dye 30,000 bolts of cloth starting on July 4th. The task was completed satisfactorily according to the contract's quality and quantity requirements, and ahead of schedule (the contract stipulated that the final factory's delivery deadline was July 28th) on July 27th. Both parties settled all loans on the 27th.

    Upon completion of this processing task, the sixteen factories can obtain a net profit of approximately 154.6 million yuan from processing fees; and can maintain full operation for more than ten days. Compared to the five or six days of monthly operation in June, before the processing contract, this represents an increase of about two times in operating time. This is indeed a great support for the aforementioned dyeing and printing factories, which are currently in a slow season. At the same time, through processing contracts, each factory has made progress in cost accounting, increasing output and quality, and improving management. The Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company can also partially complete its task and role in currency withdrawal and market stabilization.

    The reasons for the successful completion of this processing were, first, that the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company conducted a more thorough investigation and research on the processing costs before negotiating the processing contracts with the factories. It established a reasonable operating standard and selected sixteen more reliable factories from the city's twenty-five dyeing and printing factories as the objects of entrusted processing. This laid a better foundation for the implementation of the contract. Second, during the negotiation and signing of the contract, and in the process of implementation after the contract was signed, the labor costs were determined more reasonably with the mutual cooperation of the relevant departments. The supply of pigments and coal was studied and resolved. In particular, when some pigment merchants attempted to raise prices during the first few days of the contract's establishment, the import company took the initiative to supply vulcanized blue pigments in order to give speculative merchants the punishment they deserved and to ensure the smooth implementation of the contract. The People's Bank provided loans of 241.5 million yuan to the thirteen factories that needed funds to purchase pigments. At the same time, the sixteen factories entrusted with processing also coordinated their actions and decided not to purchase pigments from the market, but to borrow and use the existing pigments in each factory, which smoothly resolved the pigment difficulty. The principle of considering both public and private interests was embodied in the following ways: First, the cost was truly calculated according to the average standard of the city's general dyeing factories under reasonable operating conditions. This not only ensured the reasonable profits of each processing factory, but also prevented the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company from suffering losses. Second, the factories entrusted with processing this time included two state-owned factories, two joint state-private factories, and twelve private factories; however, there was no discrimination in the regulation of processing fees or in the quantity of dyed cloth allocated.

    Through this processing contract, the factories have realized the importance of cost accounting. In the past, many factories were careless in this regard, and many factories could not even produce a cost sheet. Now, the cost accounting of general factories has become more sound. Some factories have also improved in terms of technology. The dyeing factories have also initially recognized the importance of reducing costs, increasing output and quality, and practicing careful calculation in research and mutual exchange of technology.

    However, some shortcomings were also revealed in this processing contract, which should be improved in the future: First, the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Branch Company did not do enough in inspecting the quality of processed products and checking the internal production plans of the factories. During the processing period, the company only sent individual staff members to a few factories for a walk, and failed to go deep into the factory's operations, the implementation of production plans, and management. After the processed products were made, no scientific grading inspection was carried out on the quality of the products. Closer ties have not yet been established with the trade unions to supervise the use of raw materials and labor in accordance with the contract, and the timely delivery of finished products. Some processing factories still have a simple dependence mentality, lacking the due understanding of how to seek to reduce costs, improve quality, practice careful calculation, accumulate funds, and plan their own independent operations through government processing support in order to overcome temporary difficulties. Moreover, some factories have exposed technical shortcomings in this processing. When dyeing vulcanized blue or 190 Shilin, dyeing defects or uneven surfaces have occurred, resulting in local rework and unnecessary losses.

### 青岛十六家印染厂  完成加工合同

　　青岛十六家印染厂
    完成加工合同
    【青岛讯】青岛日报消息：青岛市花纱布支公司于七月四日起，委托该市十六家印染厂代染的三万匹布，已于七月二十七日遵照合同规定，按质、按量、并提前按时（合同规定最后一家交成品的期限为七月二十八日），较圆满地完成代染任务，二十七日双方已实行贷款两清。
    此项代染任务完成后，十六家厂商约可从工缴费中获得纯利一亿五千四百六十余万元；并能维持十天以上的开全工时间，比之没有加工代染时六月份的每月只能开工五、六天，可增加两倍左右的开工时间，这对于目前正处在淡月的上述印染厂商确是一极大扶持。同时，通过加工代染，各厂家在成本核算，提高产量、质量，及改进管理等方面，也较前有了进步。花纱布支公司也可因此而部分完成其货币回笼或稳定市场的任务和作用。
    这次加工完成较好的原因，首先是由于花纱布支公司在与各厂进行协商加工代染以前，对加工代染成本作了较周密的调查研究，订出了合理经营的中等标准，由全市二十五家印染厂中觅取了十六家较为可靠的厂商作为委托加工代染的对象。为合同的贯彻执行打下了较好的基础。其次，是协商签定合同当中，及合同签定以后的执行过程中，在有关各部门的互相配合下，较合理地确定了工缴费，研究并解决了颜料及煤炭的供应问题，特别当成立合约的几天内，部分颜料商企图乘机哄抬物价，为了给投机商人以应有打击，并保证合同顺利执行起见，进口公司主动供应了硫化蓝颜料，人民银行则以二亿四千一百五十万元，对需款购买颜料的十三个厂贷款，与此同时，受托加工的十六个厂亦配合行动，决议不从市场采购颜料，以现有各厂尚存颜料数量相互挪借使用，顺利解决了颜料的困难。表现于公私兼顾方面：首先是真正按照该市一般染厂在合理经营条件之下的中等标准来计算成本。这就既保证了代染各厂的合理利润，又使花纱布支公司不致因此而吃亏。其次，这次受托加工的厂中，有公营两家、公私合营两家及私营十二家；但不论在加工费的规定上或代染布匹分配的数量上，都是一视同仁的。
    通过这次加工代染，已促使各厂认识到成本核算的重要，过去在这方面很多厂是马马虎虎的，甚至不少厂连个成本单都开不出来，现在一般厂的成本会计更加健全起来。技术方面有些厂也有了提高，各代染厂并在研究和互相交流技术中，初步认识了减低成本，提高产量、质量，实行精打细算的重要。
    但在这次加工代染中还表现了一些缺点，应在今后注意改进：第一，花纱布支公司对加工成品品质的检验与工厂内部生产计划的检查作的都很不够。在加工期间该公司只派个别工作人员到几个工厂中走了一趟，并未能深入到厂的经营、生产计划的执行及管理等方面进行检查，而在加工成品制成以后，也未对成品品质作科学的分别等级的进行检验。与工会方面也还未建立较密切的联系，以便监督原料与工缴的如约运用，及成品的准期缴付。也有部分代染厂尚存单纯的依赖思想，对于如何通过政府的加工扶持，求得降低成本，提高质量，实行精打细算，积累资金，以图度过暂时困难，积极地筹划自己的独立经营等，都缺乏应有的认识。且有的厂在这次加工中暴露了技术上的缺点，在染硫化蓝或一九○士林时，都发生过染花或出现阴阳面现象，因此造成局部翻工，遭受到不必要的损失。
