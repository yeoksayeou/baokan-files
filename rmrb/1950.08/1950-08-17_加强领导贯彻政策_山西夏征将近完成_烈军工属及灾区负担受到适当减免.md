Strengthening Leadership to Implement Policies
    Shanxi's Summer Grain Tax Collection Nearing Completion
    Burdens on Families of Martyrs, Soldiers, and Workers, and Disaster Areas Appropriately Reduced
    [This newspaper Taiyuan news] As of August 3rd, Shanxi Province's summer grain tax collection, with the exception of Changzhi and Xinxian prefectures where the wheat harvest was later, had completed 86.04% of the total task. Excluding Changzhi and Xinxian, the completion rate reached 99.91%. Specifically, the suburbs of Taiyuan City completed 102.3%, Yuncheng Prefecture completed 101.7%, Linfen Prefecture completed 101.2%, and Yuci and Fenyang Prefectures also completed 100%. Xingxian Prefecture, due to a later start, had only completed 12.24%.

    The achievement of these results is mainly due to the clear understanding and conscientious implementation by leaders at all levels of the guiding principle put forward at the Provincial Government's April fiscal meeting: "Strengthen leadership, implement policies, do good work, and complete the task 100%." This corrected the "more or less" thinking that "completing 80% or 90% of the task is considered done." Strict criticism was also directed at the privileged mentality of certain cadres who did not pay public grain, as well as the one-sided "benevolent governance" viewpoint of "only implementing policies and not completing tasks," and the purely task-oriented viewpoint of disregarding policies in order to complete tasks. At the same time, in-depth mobilization sparked a wave of grain delivery competitions among the masses.

    In terms of policy implementation, the unified enforcement of the North China Provisional Agricultural Tax Regulations across the province not only unified policies but also balanced burdens. Most poor families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as disaster areas, received consideration. For example, in 62 villages of Yuanqu, 549 households were given consideration, with a reduction of 1,040 *shi* in production. Hongdong County provided assistance to 2,805 households, reducing production by 6,659 *shi*. It is estimated that tax reductions throughout the province accounted for 9% of the total annual task. These measures were warmly welcomed by the masses.

    During the grain delivery process, each county also widely focused on praising the good and criticizing the bad, which promoted the overall work. The rewarded masses were in high spirits and felt very honored.

    However, in some villages in individual counties, due to insufficient mobilization and inadequate policy implementation, some deviations occurred. For example, some village cadres in Jiexian equally reduced the disaster relief and tax reduction grain, instead of reducing or exempting according to the severity of the task and the severity of the disaster. Some villages in Xinxian retained tax reduction grain, preparing to deduct it when assigning burdens in 1951. In other villages, due to the eagerness to complete the task, coercive orders were issued. For example, in the second district of Zhaocheng, six village cadres were detained. In the first district of Yishi, armed cadres slapped the masses and threatened them with guns, fortunately not resulting in fatalities. Some villages also levied excessive public grain, increasing the burden on the masses. Four villages in Wenxi levied an extra 7,750 *jin*, and ten villages in Huoxian levied an extra 19,135 *jin*. In Yuxiang, the land production was incorrectly reported, over-reporting 30,000 to 40,000 *mu*, which also increased the burden on the masses. Some of these problems have been corrected, and others are being resolved.

### 加强领导贯彻政策  山西夏征将近完成  烈军工属及灾区负担受到适当减免

　　加强领导贯彻政策
    山西夏征将近完成
    烈军工属及灾区负担受到适当减免
    【本报太原讯】山西全省夏征截至八月三日止，除长治、忻县两专区麦收较晚尚未开征外，总计已完成总任务百分之八十六点零四；除长、忻两专区，则完成比例已达百分之九十九点九一。计太原市郊区完成百分之一百零二点三，运城专区完成百分之一百零一点七，临汾专区完成百分之一百零一点二，榆次、汾阳二专区亦均百分之百的完成了，兴县专区因开征较晚，尚只完成百分之十二点二四。
    上述成绩的获得，主要是各级领导上明确掌握与认真贯彻了省府四月财政会议提出的“加强领导，贯彻政策，作好工作，百分之百完成任务”的思想指导方针，纠正了“任务完成百分之八、九十即算完成任务”的差不多思想。并对某些干部不交公粮的特权思想，以及“只贯彻政策，不完成任务”的片面仁政观点与为了完成任务不顾政策的单纯任务观点等，作了严格的批判。同时又深入动员，在群众中掀起交粮竞赛热潮。
    在贯彻政策方面，由于全省统一执行了华北农业税暂行税则，不仅统一了政策，而且平衡了负担，对于贫苦烈、军、工属及灾区，大部分均进行了照顾，如垣曲六十二村即分别照顾了五百四十九户，减免产量一千零四十石；洪洞县照顾了二千八百零五户，减免产量六千六百五十九石。计全省减征占全年总任务百分之九。这些措施都受到了群众的热烈拥护。
    在缴粮过程中，各县并广泛注意了表扬好的，批评坏的，推动了整个工作，受奖群众情绪很高，觉得很光荣。
    但也有个别县的某些村，由于动员不深入，政策贯彻不够，发生了些偏差。如解县有些村干部，把减征及减灾粮平均减去，而不是按任务轻重及灾情轻重分别减免。忻县某些村留下减征粮，准备于一九五一年派负担时扣除。再有些村由于急于完成任务，发生了强迫命令，如赵城二区扣过六个村干部；猗氏一区武装干部打过群众耳光，并开枪威胁，幸未酿成命案。还有些村多派公粮，加重了群众负担。闻喜四个村多派了七千七百五十斤，霍县十个村多派了一万九千一百三十五斤。虞乡弄错了土地产量，多报了三、四万亩，也加重了群众负担。这些问题，有的已经纠正了有的正在解决中。
