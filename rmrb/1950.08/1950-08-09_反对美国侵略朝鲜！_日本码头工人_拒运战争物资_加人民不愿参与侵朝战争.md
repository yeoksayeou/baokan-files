Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: A France-Presse dispatch from Paris on the 7th, citing a Leipzig radio broadcast, reported: Dockworkers in the Japanese port of Sasebo refused to transport war materials to South Korea. Merchant marine sailors who were asked to replace these dockworkers also refused to transport war materials.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Ottawa on the 7th: The people of Canada, like the people of the United States, are unwilling to participate in the aggression against the Korean people. The recruitment of "volunteers" for Korea is proceeding extremely poorly, forcing the military authorities to further lower the enlistment qualifications. On August 4th, Defense Minister Claxton announced the cancellation of educational requirements for enlistment. The "Montreal Star" quoted reliable sources as saying that the method of public recruitment will be changed, and the method of publicizing the recruitment situation that has been used so far has been abolished.
