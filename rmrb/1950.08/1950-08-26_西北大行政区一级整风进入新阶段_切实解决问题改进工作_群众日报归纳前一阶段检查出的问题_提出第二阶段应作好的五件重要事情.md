The Northwest Administrative Region First-Level Rectification Enters New Stage
    Resolutely Solve Problems and Improve Work
    People's Daily Summarizes Problems Discovered in the Previous Stage
    Proposes Five Important Things to Do in the Second Stage
    [Our Newspaper News] The Xi'an People's Daily published an editorial on August 18th titled "Pushing the Rectification Study Forward," stating that the first-level rectification study in the Northwest Administrative Region has, in its main aspects, completed the first stage, which focused on exposing problems, and is beginning to enter a new stage of resolutely solving problems—the most important stage of the rectification movement.
    In the first stage, due to adhering to the correct rectification instructions of the CCP Central Committee and the specific image and specific tasks of opposing bureaucracy and commandism put forward by Comrade Xi Zhongxun, document study was widely carried out, democracy within and outside the Party was developed under leadership, criticism and self-criticism were launched, and the political enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres was brought into play, focusing the attention of the entire Party on the main dangerous tendencies in the work of the Party and the state, making various forms of bureaucracy in the work fully exposed. The main problems identified in this stage are as follows:
    First, the bureaucratic attitude in the implementation of policies. Failure to carefully study and analyze policies; failure to combine policies with the actual conditions of the region and implement them according to the level of awareness of the masses; failure to adopt a comprehensive view of grasping the main links while taking into account other circumstances in the implementation of policies, thus causing losses in the work. For example, in the work of taxation and issuing public bonds, there was a serious single-minded task-oriented view. There was no good investigation and research on tax sources, and even several tax regulations were promulgated and implemented without the approval of the Northwest Military and Political Committee. As a result, working cadres made the mistake of commandism, doing everything possible to complete the tasks regardless of everything else. In Xi'an City, in the collection of the first quarter's business tax, there were more than 800 households punished alone; regarding the use of license plate tax, 1,384 bicycles were fined, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. Such problems are most evident in financial and economic work and also seriously exist in other departments.
    Second, subjectivism in work and impractical working methods. This is still a common problem in various departments in the Northwest. As the financial and economic departments reviewed: the water conservancy project plan in Hua County and Huayin County subjectively estimated that 280,000 mu could be drained, but the actual water depth was difficult to drain, and only more than 40,000 mu could be drained, resulting in an excessively large budget. When making single clothing in 1950, the Northwest Finance Department informed in a January notice that there were 270,000 internal affairs and civilian cadres, and the supply department reduced it to more than 200,000 sets based on streamlining, but only more than 122,700 sets were actually issued. Another phenomenon is the indiscriminate issuance of forms and official documents without considering the situation of the cadres below. Not only are many issued, but some are simply impossible to complete. For example, requiring rural areas to report water flow velocity and fill in the number of eggs laid by chickens every month. The top urges tightly, and the cadres below sit at home and make an estimate to report it. And the top relies on these forms to report to grasp the situation and guide the work, isn't it terrible!
    In addition, there are serious delays, procrastination, and irresponsible red tape. According to inspections, more than 40 documents circulated by the Northwest Public Security Department took two to three months to circulate in the past year, and individual documents even took five to six months. The Northwest Civil Affairs Department required an average of 30 procedures for each official document from receipt to issuance. Sometimes it took four or five days for a document to reach the staff member after entering the door. It took 18 procedures for the cadre section to send a telegram. The department has been drafting instructions on banning opium for half a year, but it has not yet been written. It takes 20 procedures for official documents to enter and exit the Northwest Water Conservancy Department, what with receipt-registration—verification and distribution—verification and signing—handing over to the secretariat—distribution to the office—handing over to the section—drafting—section verification—office verification—director verification—minister's approval—handing over to the office—handing over to the secretariat—returning to the office—handing over to the section—drafting—section verification—office verification—secretariat verification—director verification—minister's judgment and execution—handing over to the secretariat—returning to the section—sending for copying—stamping—sealing and sending. It takes half a month to 20 days to handle a document. This kind of time-wasting and inefficient work style is extremely harmful to the work. This phenomenon of official documents parading around, turning around, and no one taking responsibility is entirely a remnant of the corrupt Kuomintang bureaucratic system and bureaucratic style. This has nothing in common with the style of a proletarian revolutionary party. It is well known that great communists demand that work be carried out with the most serious responsible attitude and revolutionary spirit. All shrinking, shirking, carelessness, and unserious work attitudes are what the Communist Party has always opposed. Loyalty to the people's cause, responsibility, and efficiency are the main manifestations of the quality of a Communist Party member. The interests of the people require us to wage a lasting and irreconcilable struggle against these phenomena and demand that we liberate ourselves from this terrible bureaucracy and become clear-headed leaders of the people's cause.
    The editorial proposes that after entering the stage of solving problems, the following things should be done well: First, the leaders of each organization should solemnly and realistically analyze the problems exposed in the previous stage, propose solutions, and report to everyone. This report should not only mainly point out shortcomings but also appropriately estimate achievements; it should not only point out the direction of advancement but also have concrete steps and concrete improvement methods (Editor's note: This report should also mobilize all cadres to discuss and supplement it. Only in this way can the analysis of problems be more correct, and the solution of problems be more thorough.) Second, we must immediately abandon the procrastination style and immediately implement the correct opinions put forward by everyone, so as to better improve everyone's enthusiasm and show the true essence of democracy. Third, we must formulate a series of practical working systems that are conducive to improving work efficiency, eliminate any remnants of the corrupt Kuomintang system; with a new revolutionary creative spirit, carry forward the fine traditions of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region era, and establish a set of working systems that fully meet the needs of the people and have high work efficiency. Fourth, for some serious bureaucratic people who violate the law and neglect their duties, after clarifying the facts, they should be submitted to the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee and the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Supervision Authority for necessary disciplinary action. Fifth, while continuing to develop the spirit of self-criticism, each comrade participating in the rectification study should make a systematic review in connection with his own work and thinking as a summary of his participation in the rectification study.

　　西北大行政区一级整风进入新阶段
    切实解决问题改进工作
    群众日报归纳前一阶段检查出的问题
    提出第二阶段应作好的五件重要事情
    【本报讯】西安群众日报于八月十八日以《把整风学习推向前进》为题发表社论称：西北大行政区一级整风学习在主要方面已经完成以暴露问题为主的第一阶段，开始进入切实解决问题的新阶段——整风运动最主要的阶段。
    在第一阶段中，由于依据了中共中央正确的整风指示和习仲勋同志提出的反对官僚主义、命令主义的具体形象和具体任务，普遍地展开了文件学习，有领导地发扬了党内外民主，开展了批评与自我批评，发挥了广大干部的政治积极性，使全党的目光集中到党的和国家的工作中的主要危险倾向上来，使得存在于工作中的各种形态的官僚主义原形毕露。这一阶段中检查出来的主要问题有以下三种：
    首先，是在执行政策上的官僚主义态度。不认真研究分析政策；不把政策与地区实际情况结合起来并根据群众觉悟程度去执行政策，在执行政策中不是既抓住主要环节而又照顾其他情况的全面观点，因而，使得工作遭受损失。例如在税收及发行公债工作中，有过严重的单纯任务观点。对税源没有很好调查研究，甚至有几种税收条例不经西北军政委员会批准即自行颁布试行。结果造成工作干部为争取完成任务而不顾一切的命令主义的错误。西安市征收第一季度营业税，单处罚就有八百余户；关于使用牌照税，就罚了自行车一千三百八十四辆，引起群众很大不满。此类问题，在财经工作中表现得最明显，在其他部门中也严重存在。
    其次是工作中的主观主义，不切实际的工作方法。这仍然是西北各个部门普遍存在的问题。像财经部门检讨出来的：华县、华阴两县水利工程计划，主观估计可排水二十八万亩，实际水深难排，只能排四万余亩，致使预算过于庞大。一九五○年制单衣时，西北财政部在一月份的通知内政民干部为二十七万人，供应处根据精简情况减为二十万零三千余套，但实发只十二万二千七百余套。另外一种现象，便是毫不考虑下面干部情况，滥发表格、公文。不但发得多，而且有些是根本无法完成的。如要农村报告水流速度，每月填报鸡生蛋的数字等。上边催的紧，下边干部坐在家里，就来个估计汇报上去。而上边就依靠这些表格汇报来掌握情况，指导工作，岂不糟糕！
    另外，还有严重的拖延迟缓、不负责任的文牍主义作风。西北公安部的文件传阅，据检查一年来曾有四十余件传阅时间经过两个月至三个月，个别文件甚至传阅至五、六个月之久。西北民政部每件公文从收入到发出平均要经三十道手续。一件公文进门，有时就要过四、五天才到科员手里。干部处发一个电报，就要十八道手续。该部起草禁烟指示已有半年，至今尚未写成。西北水利部公文进出要二十道手续，什么收登—核分—核签—交秘—分处—交科—签拟—处核—秘核—主任核—部长批阅—交办公室—交秘—还处—交科—拟稿—科核—处核—秘核—主任核—部长判行—交秘—还科—送缮—用印—封发，办理一件公文有的需要半月至二十天时间，这种没有时间观念，不讲效率的作风，对于工作的危害至为明显。像这种公文游行，转来转去，无人负责的现象，完全是腐朽的国民党官僚制度和官僚作风的残余。这是与无产阶级革命政党的作风毫无相同之处的。人所共知，伟大的共产党人要求以最严肃的负责态度和革命气魄来进行工作。一切畏缩、推诿、马虎、不认真的工作态度乃是共产党历来所反对的。对于人民事业的忠诚、负责、讲求效率的精神乃是一个共产党员品质的主要表现。人民的利益要求我们必须同这些现象作持久的不调和的斗争，要求我们从这种恶劣的官僚主义中解放出来，成为人民事业的清醒的领导者。
    社论提出，在进入解决问题阶段后，应当来作好以下几件事情：第一、每个机关的领导者要郑重而实事求是地根据前一阶段暴露出来的问题，进行分析，提出办法，向大家作报告。这报告不仅主要指出缺点，也要恰当估计成绩；不仅要指出前进方向，而且要有具体步骤，具体改进办法（编者按：这个报告还应当发动全体干部进行讨论与补充。这样分析问题才能更正确，解决问题才能更彻底。）第二、要立即抛弃那种拖延迟缓作风，必须把大家提出的正确意见，马上实行起来，才能更好地提高大家积极性，表现真正民主实质。第三、必须订出一系列切合实际的便于提高工作效率的工作制度，要扫除国民党腐朽制度的任何残余；以新的革命的创造精神，发扬陕甘宁边区时代的优良传统，建立一套完全适应人民需要、有高度工作效率的工作制度。第四、对于一些严重的违法渎职的官僚主义者，在弄清事实后，应该提交党的纪律检查委员会和西北军政委员会监察机关，给予必要的纪律处分。第五、在继续发展自我批评的精神下，每个参加整风学习的同志，都要联系自己的工作和思想作一个系统的检查，作为自己参加整风学习的总结。
