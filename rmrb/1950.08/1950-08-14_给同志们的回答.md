　　Stalin
    These are three letters from Stalin answering comrades on the question of linguistics, published together in the fourteenth issue of the journal "Bolshevik" in July 1950.

    Reply to Comrade Sanzhiev
    Respected Comrade Sanzhiev!
    I am late in replying to your letter because it was only yesterday that your letter was forwarded to me from the central authorities.
    You are undoubtedly correct in interpreting my position on the issue of vernacular idioms.
    "Class" idioms, or more correctly, should be called jargon, do not serve the masses of the people, but rather the narrow upper strata of society. Moreover, they do not have their own grammatical structure and basic vocabulary. Therefore, they can in no way develop into independent languages.
    Conversely, local ("regional") dialects serve the masses of the people and have their own grammatical structure and basic vocabulary. Therefore, certain local dialects can become the basis of national languages and develop into independent national languages during the formation of nations. For example, this is the case with the Kursk-Orel dialect (Kursk-Orel "speech") in the Russian language, which became the basis of the Russian national language. The same must be said of the Poltava-Kiev dialect, which became the basis of the Ukrainian national language. As for the other dialects in these languages, they lost their uniqueness, dissolved into these languages, and disappeared in these languages.
    There is also the opposite development process: a tribe has not yet become a nation due to the lack of necessary economic development conditions, and its unified language disintegrates due to the collapse of the state; as for the local dialects that have not yet been worn away in the unified language, they become active and become the basis for forming separate independent languages. For example, this may be the case with the unified Mongolian language.

  Reply to Comrades Belkin and Fuller
  Your letter has been received.
  Your mistake is to confuse two different things and replace the topic I studied in my reply to Comrade Krasheninnikova with another topic.
    (1) In this reply, I criticized Marr for separating language (spoken language) from thought when discussing language and thought, thereby falling into idealism. Thus, what I said in my reply refers to normal people who can speak. And I asserted that the thoughts of such people can only arise on the basis of linguistic material; for people who can speak, bare thoughts that are not connected with linguistic material do not exist.
    You did not accept or refute this principle, but instead cited abnormal people who cannot speak, deaf-mutes, who cannot speak, and of course their thoughts cannot arise on the basis of linguistic material. Thus, this is a completely different topic, which I did not and could not talk about, because linguistics studies normal people who can speak, not abnormal deaf-mutes who cannot speak.
    You replaced the topic being discussed with another topic that was not discussed.
    (2) It can be seen from Comrade Belkin's letter that he juxtaposes "word language" (spoken language) and "sign language" (according to Marr, "hand" language). Perhaps he believes that sign language and word language are equivalent, and that there was a period in human society when there was no word language, and "hand" language replaced the word language that appeared later.
    However, if Comrade Belkin really has such an idea, then he has made a serious mistake. Spoken language or word language has always been the only language in human society that can serve as a perfect tool for people to communicate.
    Historically, no human society, even the most backward, has been able to exist without its own spoken language. Ethnology does not know of any backward tribe, even if it is, for example, as primitive as the Australians or Fuegians of the nineteenth century, or even more primitive, that has been able to exist without its own spoken language. Spoken language in human history is one of the forces that has helped people separate themselves from the animal world, unite into society, develop their thinking, organize social production, fight victoriously against the forces of nature, and achieve all the progress we have today.
    In this regard, the significance of so-called sign language, due to its extreme poverty and limitations, is negligible. In fact, this is not a language, or even a language that can replace spoken language in one way or another, but rather an auxiliary means that people sometimes use to emphasize certain places in their speech, and this auxiliary means is extremely limited in its expression. One cannot equate sign language with spoken language, just as one cannot equate a primitive wooden hoe with a modern state-of-the-art tractor.
    (3) Thus, you are primarily interested in deaf-mutes, and only then in linguistic issues. Obviously, it is this situation that has led you to ask me some questions. Well, if you insist, I might as well satisfy your request. So what is the situation with deaf-mutes? Are their minds working, are thoughts being produced? Yes, their minds are working, and thoughts are being produced. Obviously, since deaf-mutes cannot speak, their thoughts cannot be produced on the basis of linguistic material. Does this mean that the thoughts of deaf-mutes are bare, unrelated to "natural norms" (Marr's term)? No, it is not. The thoughts of deaf-mutes arise and can only survive on the basis of images, perceptions, and ideas about the objects of the external world and their interrelationships that they form in their daily lives through sight, touch, taste, and smell. Without these images, perceptions, and ideas, thought is empty, loses any content, that is, it does not exist.

    Reply to Comrade A. Kholopov
    Your letter has been received.
    The reply was slightly delayed due to busy work.
    Your letter implicitly starts from two assumptions: the first assumption is that one can quote an author's works by detaching them from the historical period mentioned in the quotation, and the second assumption is that certain Marxist conclusions and formulas drawn from the study of a historical development period are correct for all historical development periods, and therefore should be forever unchanged.
    It must be said that both of these assumptions are completely wrong.
    A few examples.
    (1) In the 1840s, monopoly capitalism did not yet exist, capitalism was developing quite smoothly along an upward path, expanding to new territories that had not been occupied, and the law of uneven capitalist development could not yet fully and powerfully play its role, - at that time Marx and Engels concluded that socialist revolution could not be victorious in a single country, it could only be victorious due to a common attack carried out in all or most civilized countries. This conclusion later became the guiding principle for all Marxists.
    However, at the beginning of the twentieth century, especially during the First World War, it was clear to everyone that pre-monopoly capitalism had obviously become monopoly capitalism, ascending capitalism had become dying capitalism, the war revealed the incurable weaknesses of the world imperialist front, and the law of uneven capitalist development determined the different periods of maturity of proletarian revolutions in various countries, - at that time Lenin, starting from Marxist theory, concluded that under the new development conditions, socialist revolution was entirely possible in a single country; the simultaneous victory of socialist revolution in all countries or most civilized countries was impossible because the maturity of revolution in these countries was uneven; the old formula of Marx and Engels was no longer suitable for the new historical conditions.
    Thus, we have here two different conclusions on the issue of socialist victory, which are not only contradictory but also mutually exclusive.
    Some pedants and bookworms, without delving into the essence of the matter, make superficial quotations by detaching themselves from historical conditions, and they may say: one of these conclusions is absolutely incorrect and should be discarded, while the other conclusion is absolutely correct and should be extended to all development periods. However, Marxists cannot fail to know that pedants and bookworms are wrong, they cannot fail to know that both conclusions are correct, but not absolutely correct, but rather each conclusion is correct for its own era: the conclusion of Marx and Engels is correct for the period of pre-monopoly capitalism, while Lenin's conclusion is correct for the period of monopoly capitalism.
    (2) Engels said in his "Anti-Dühring" that after the victory of the socialist revolution, the state should wither away. Thus, based on this, after the victory of the socialist revolution in our country, some pedants and bookworms in our party began to demand that the party take measures to make our state wither away as soon as possible, dissolve the state organs, and abolish the standing army.
    However, Soviet Marxists, based on their study of the contemporary world situation, concluded that under capitalist encirclement, the victory of socialist revolution only occurs in one country, while all other countries are ruled by capitalism, at this time the country where the revolution has been victorious should not weaken its state, state organs, intelligence agencies, and army, but should strengthen them by all means, if this country does not want to be defeated by the capitalist encirclement. Russian Marxists concluded that Engels' formula refers to the victory of socialism in all or most countries, and it is not applicable to the following occasion, that is, when socialism is victorious in a single country, while all other countries are ruled by capitalism.
    Thus, we have here two different formulas on the issue of the fate of the socialist state, which are mutually exclusive.
    Pedants and bookworms may say: this situation creates an unbearable situation, and one of the formulas must be regarded as absolutely wrong and discarded, and the other must be regarded as absolutely correct and extended to all periods of socialist state development. However, Marxists cannot fail to know that pedants and bookworms are wrong, because both formulas are correct, but not absolutely correct, but rather each formula is correct for its own era: the formula of Soviet Marxists is correct for the period when socialism is victorious in one or several countries, while Engels' formula is correct for the following period, that is, when the successive victories of socialism in individual countries lead to the victory of socialism in most countries, so that the necessary conditions for implementing Engels' formula will be created.
    More examples like this can be given.
    The same must be said of the two different formulas regarding language issues in Comrade Kholopov's citation of various works by Stalin in his letter.
    Comrade Kholopov cited Stalin's work "On Marxism in Linguistics," in which he made the conclusion that, for example, as a result of the fusion of two languages, one of the languages usually becomes the victor, while the other falls into decline; it can be seen that the fusion of two languages does not produce any new third language, but rather one of them is preserved. Secondly, he also cited another conclusion made by Stalin in his report to the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which said: in the period when socialism is victorious on a world scale, when socialism is consolidated and realized in everyday life, the languages of various nations will inevitably merge into a common language, which of course will not be the Great Russian language, nor will it be the German language, but rather some new language. Comrade Kholopov compared these two formulas and found that they were not only inconsistent with each other, but also mutually exclusive, and then became disappointed. "From your article - he wrote in his letter - I understood that the fusion of languages will never produce some new language, but before this article was published, based on your speech at the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), I firmly and deeply believed that in the communist era, various languages would merge into a common language."
    It is obvious that Comrade Kholopov discovered the contradiction between these two formulas and firmly believed that the contradiction should be eliminated, so he believed that it was necessary to discard the incorrect one of the formulas and seize the other one that was correct for all eras and countries, but which one to seize - he did not know. It really seemed like he was trapped in a dead end. Kholopov also did not think that both formulas might be correct - each one is correct for its own era.
    This is often the case with pedants and bookworms, they do not delve into the essence of the matter, and only make superficial quotations regardless of the historical conditions mentioned in the quotation, and the result is bound to be trapped in a dead end.
    However, if you analyze the essence of the problem, there is no reason to feel trapped in a dead end. The problem is that Stalin's booklet "On Marxism in Linguistics" and Stalin's speech at the Party's Sixteenth Congress refer to two completely different eras, so the formulas obtained are also different.
    The formula in Stalin's booklet concerning the issue of language fusion refers to the era before the victory of socialism on a world scale, in this era the exploiting classes are the ruling forces in the world, the oppression of nations and colonies is still very serious, national isolation and distrust are consolidated by national distinctions, national equality does not yet exist, the fusion of languages is carried out in the struggle to seize the dominant position of a language; the conditions for peaceful and friendly cooperation between various nations and languages are not yet available, the issue on the agenda is not the cooperation and mutual enrichment of various languages, but the assimilation of some languages and the victory of others. Needless to say, under such conditions there can only be a victorious language and a defeated language. Stalin's formula refers precisely to these conditions, because this formula states: for example, the fusion of two languages, the result is not the formation of a new language, but the victory of one of the languages and the defeat of the other.
    As for the other formula mentioned by Stalin in his speech at the Party's Sixteenth Congress concerning the fusion of various languages into a common language, then this refers to another era, that is, the era after the victory of socialism on a world scale, in this era world imperialism will no longer exist, the exploiting classes will be overthrown, the oppression of nations and colonies will be eliminated, national isolation and distrust will be replaced by national mutual trust and closeness, the equality of national rights will be realized, the policy of suppressing and assimilating languages will be abolished, cooperation between various nations will be established, and the languages of various nations will have the possibility of mutually enriching themselves in a cooperative manner. Needless to say, under these conditions there is no question of the suppression and defeat of some languages and the victory of others. Here we will not encounter two languages - one of which suffers defeat while the other becomes the victor in the struggle, but rather hundreds of national languages - these languages, due to the long-term cooperation of various nations in economic, political and cultural aspects, will first separate out the richest single regional languages, and then the regional languages will merge into a common international language, which of course will not be the German language, nor will it be the Russian language, let alone the English language, but rather a new language that has absorbed the essence of the languages of various nations and various regional languages.
    Therefore, two different formulas are adapted to two different eras of social development, and precisely because they are adapted to them, both formulas are correct - each one is correct for its own era.
    How absurd it is to demand that these two formulas not contradict each other, to demand that they not be mutually exclusive, just like demanding that the era of capitalist rule not contradict the era of socialist rule, and that socialism and capitalism not be mutually exclusive.
    Pedants and bookworms regard Marxism, individual Marxist conclusions and formulas as a collection of dogmas, and these dogmas are "forever" unchanged, although the conditions of social development have changed. They believe that if they memorize these conclusions and formulas and quote them indiscriminately, then they will be able to solve any problem, because they expect that the memorized conclusions and formulas are applicable to all eras and countries, and to all life situations. But only those who see the letters of Marxism but do not see its essence, memorize the conclusions and formulas of Marxism but do not understand their content, can have such an idea.
    Marxism is the science of the laws of development of nature and society, the science of the revolution of the oppressed and exploited masses, the science of the victory of socialism in all countries, the science of building a communist society. This science of Marxism cannot stand still - it is developing and improving. Marxism in its development cannot but be enriched by new experiences and new knowledge - therefore its individual formulas and conclusions cannot but change with time and be replaced by new formulas and conclusions adapted to new historical tasks. Marxism does not recognize unchanging conclusions and formulas that are absolutely adapted to all eras and periods. Marxism is the enemy of all dogmatism.

　　给同志们的回答
　　斯大林
    这是斯大林关于语言学问题答复同志们的三封信，一同刊登在一九五○年七月《布尔什维克》杂志第十四期。
    ——编者
    答桑席叶夫同志敬爱的桑席叶夫同志！
    我回答你的信太迟了，因为你的信昨天才从中央机关转交给我。
    你无疑是正确地解释了我在方言习惯语问题上的立场。
    “阶级”习惯语，正确些说，应当叫作同行话，并非替人民群众服务，而是替狭小的社会上层分子服务。此外，它们没有自己本身的文法构造和基本词汇。因此，它们无论如何不能发展成为独立的语言。
    相反地，地方（“地域”）方言，是替人民群众服务，并且有自己的文法构造和基本词汇。因此，某些地方方言在民族形成过程中可以成为民族语言的基础并发展为独立的民族语言。例如，对于成为了俄罗斯民族语言基础的俄罗斯语言中的库尔斯克—奥勒尔方言（库尔斯克—奥勒尔“话”），情形就是如此。对于成为了乌克兰民族言语基础的坡尔塔发—基辅方言，也必须这样说。至于说到这些语言中的其他方言，那末它们丧失了自己的独特性，溶入这些语言中，并在这些语言中消灭了。
    也有相反的发展过程：一个部族由于缺乏必要的经济发展条件而还未成为民族，它的统一的语言因为国家崩溃便瓦解了；至于还没有在统一语言中被磨掉的地方方言，却活跃起来并成为形成单独独立语言的基础。例如，对于统一的蒙古语言，情形可能就正是这样。
              约·斯大林
        一九五○年七月十一日
  答别尔金和富列尔两同志
  你们的信收到了。
  你们的错误是把两种不同的东西混为一谈，用另外的题目代替了我给克拉舍宁尼科娃同志的答复中所研究的题目。
    （一）我在这个答复中批判了马尔在论到语言（有声语言）和思维时，把语言同思维分割开来，因而陷入了唯心主义。由此可见，我答复中所说的是会讲话的正常的人。我并且断言道：这种人的思想只有在语言材料的基础上才能产生；对于会讲话的人，与语言材料没有联系的赤裸裸的思想是不存在的。
    你们没有接受或驳斥这个原理，却举出了不正常的不会讲话的人、哑聋的人来，他们不会讲话，当然他们的思想不能在语言材料的基础上产生。由此可见，这完全是另外一个题目，这个题目我没有讲到也不能讲到，因为语言学研究的是会讲话的正常的人，而非不正常的不会讲话的哑聋的人。
    你们是用另外一个未被讨论的题目来代替了被讨论的题目。
    （二）从别尔金同志的信中可以看出：他把“字的语言”（有声语言）和“手势语言”（照马尔的说法，“手的”语言）并列看待。也许他认为手势语言和字的语言是同等的东西，人类社会有一个时期是没有字的语言的，“手的”语言当时代替了以后出现的字的语言。
    但是，如果别尔金同志真正有这样的想法，那末他就犯了严重的错误。有声语言或字的语言始终是人类社会唯一的能作为人们完善的交际工具的语言。
    历史上没有任何一个人类社会，即令是最落后的，能够没有自己的有声言语。人种学不知道有任何一个落后的部族，即令是，比方说，像十九世纪的澳洲人或火地人一样原始的或还更原始的，能够没有自己的有声语言。有声语言在人类历史上是帮助人们从动物界划分出来、结合成社会、发展自己的思维、组织社会生产、与自然力量作胜利斗争并达到我们今天所有的进步的力量之一。
    在这一方面，所谓手势语言的意义，由于它极端贫乏和被局限着——是小得不足道的。其实这不是语言，甚至不是这样或那样能代替有声语言的语言，而是人们有时用来强调自己讲话中的某些地方的辅助手段，这个辅助手段在表现方法上是极其有限的。不能把手势语言和有声语言等量齐观，正如不能把原始的木锄与现代最新式的拖拉机等量齐观一样。
    （三）由此可见，你们首先感到兴趣的是哑聋的人，然后才是语言学问题。显然地，正是这个情况使得你们向我提出一些问题来。好罢，你们如果要坚持的话，我就不妨满足你们的要求吧。那末哑聋的人的情形到底是怎样的呢？他们的思维是否在工作着呢，思想是否在产生着呢？是的，他们的思维是在工作着，思想是在产生着。显然地，既然哑聋的人不能讲话，他们的思想便是不能在语言材料的基础上产生的。这是不是说哑聋的人的思想是赤裸裸的、与“自然规范”（马尔的用语）没有联系的呢？不，不是的。哑聋的人的思想之产生和能够生存，只能是根据他们日常生活中由于视觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉而形成的对于外在世界对象及其相互关系的形象、知觉和观念。在这些形象、知觉、观念之外，思想就是空洞的，失去任何内容，就是说，它是不存在的。
              约·斯大林
                一九五○年七月二十二日
    答阿·霍洛波夫同志
    你的信收到了。
    由于工作很忙，答复稍为迟了些。
    你的信无形中是从两个假定出发：第一个假定是认为可以脱离引文中所讲到的历史时期而引证某一作者的著作，第二个假定是认为从研究一个历史发展时期而得出的某些马克思主义结论和公式，对于一切历史发展时期都是正确的，因而应当是永远不变的。
    应当说这两个假定都是大错特错。
    几个例子。
    （一）在十九世纪四十年代，垄断资本主义还不存在，资本主义沿着上升的路线相当平稳地发展着，向未被占领的新的地域扩张，而资本主义发展不平衡的规律还不能充分有力地起作用，——那时候马克思和恩格斯得出了结论：社会主义革命不可能在单独某一国家内胜利，它只有由于一切或大多数文明国家里实行了共同的攻击才能胜利。这个结论后来便成了一切马克思主义者的指导原理。
    可是在二十世纪初，特别在第一次世界大战时期，谁都明白，垄断前的资本主义显然已变为了垄断的资本主义，上升的资本主义已变成了垂死的资本主义，战争揭露了世界帝国主义阵线不可救药的弱点，而资本主义发展不平衡的规律决定了各国无产阶级革命成熟时期的不同，——那时候列宁从马克思主义理论出发，得出了结论：在新的发展条件下，社会主义革命完全可能在单独一个国家内胜利；社会主义革命在一切国家或大多数文明国家内同时胜利是不可能的，因为在这些国家中革命的成熟是不平衡的；马克思和恩格斯的旧公式已经不适合于新的历史条件了。
    由此可见，我们在这里有着社会主义胜利问题的两个不同的结论，它们不仅互相矛盾，而且还互相排斥。
    某些书呆子和死啃书本的人不深入事情的本质，脱离历史条件而作表面上的引证，他们可以说：这些结论中有一个是绝对不正确的，应当加以抛弃，而另一个结论是绝对正确的，应当推广到一切发展时期。但是马克思主义者不能不知道书呆子和死啃书本的人是错误的，他们不能不知道这两个结论都是正确的，但不是绝对地正确的，而是每一个结论对于自己的时代是正确的：马克思和恩格斯的结论对于在垄断以前的资本主义时期是正确的，而列宁的结论则对于垄断的资本主义时期是正确的。
    （二）恩格斯在其《反杜林论》中说道：在社会主义革命胜利以后，国家应当衰亡。于是根据这点，在我国社会主义革命胜利以后，我们党内的一些书呆子和死啃书本的人便开始要求党采取办法使我们的国家尽快地衰亡，把国家机关解散，把常备军取消。
    但是苏联马克思主义者，根据对当代世界形势的研究，得出了结论：在资本主义包围之下，社会主义革命的胜利只发生在一个国家内，而所有其他国家则为资本主义所统治，这时候革命胜利了的国家不应当削弱自己的国家、国家机关、侦察机关、军队，而应当用一切办法加强它们，如果这个国家不愿意被资本主义的包围所击溃的话。俄国马克思主义者得出了结论：恩格斯的公式是指社会主义在一切国家或大多数国家内获得了胜利而言，它对于下列场合却是不适用的，即社会主义在单独一个国家内胜利，而其他一切国家则为资本主义所统治。
    由此可见，我们在这里有着社会主义国家命运问题的两个不同的公式，它们是互相排斥的。
    书呆子和死啃书本的人可以说：这个情形造成了不堪忍受的状况，必须把公式中的一个看作绝对错误的而加以抛弃，把另外的一个看作绝对正确的而推广到社会主义国家发展的一切时期。但是马克思主义者不能不知道：书呆子和死啃书本的人是错误的，因为这两个公式都是正确的，但不是绝对地正确的，而是每一个公式对于自己的时代是正确的：苏联马克思主义者的公式对于社会主义在一个或几个国家内胜利的时期是正确的，恩格斯的公式则对于下列的时期是正确的，即社会主义在个别国家内陆续的胜利引导到社会主义在大多数国家内的胜利，这样一来，实行恩格斯公式的必要条件才会造成。
    像这样的例子还可以举出一些。
    对于霍洛波夫同志在其信中引证斯大林各种著作的关于语言问题的两个不同的公式，就必须这样说。
    霍洛波夫同志引证斯大林《关于马克思主义在语言学中的问题》这一著作，其中作出了这个结论：比方说，由于两种语言融合的结果，其中的一种语言通常成为胜利者，而另一种则陷于衰亡；可见两种语言的融合并不产生什么新的第三种语言，而是其中的一种保存下来。其次，他又引证斯大林在联共（布）第十六次代表大会报告中的另一个结论，这个结论说：在社会主义在世界范围内胜利的时期，当社会主义巩固起来并实现于日常生活之中，各个民族语言就必不可免地会溶合为一个共同的语言，这个语言当然不会是大俄罗斯语言，也不会是德国语言，而是某种新的语言。霍洛波夫同志把这两个公式对照了一下，发现它们不仅不互相一致，而且是互相排斥的，于是失望起来。“从你的文章里——他在信中写道——我理解了语言的融合永远不会产生某种新的语言，可是在这篇文章发表以前，根据你在联共（布）第十六次代表大会的发言，我曾坚决地深信：在共产主义时期，各种语言会溶合为一个共同的语言”。
    显而易见，霍洛波夫同志发现了这两个公式的矛盾并且深信应当消灭矛盾，于是认为必须丢掉公式中的不正确的一个，而抓住对于一切时代和国家都正确的另一个，但是必须抓住哪一个呢，——他就不知道了。真好像是陷入了走头无路的状态。霍洛波夫也没有想到：两个公式都可能是正确的，——每一个对于自己的时代是正确的。
    书呆子和死啃书本的人常常就是这样，他们不深入事情的本质，不管引文中所讲到的历史条件而只作表面上的引证，结果必然陷入走头无路的状态。
    然而，如果分析一下问题的本质，就没有任何理由感到走头无路了。问题是在于：斯大林的《论马克思主义在语言学中的问题》这一小册子和斯大林在党第十六次代表大会上的发言所指的是两个完全不相同的时代，因此所得出的公式也不相同。
    斯大林在其小册子中的论及语言融合问题的那个公式，是指社会主义在世界范围内胜利以前的时代，在这个时代中剥削阶级是世界上统治的力量，对民族和殖民地的压迫仍然很厉害，民族的隔离和互不信任被国家的区别所巩固着，民族的平等还不存在，语言的融合是在争取一种语言的统治地位的斗争中进行着；各个民族和各个语言的和平与友谊的合作条件还未具备，摆在日程上面的问题不是各个语言的合作和互相丰富，而是一些语言的被同化和另一些语言的胜利。不用说，在这样的条件下有的只能是战胜了的语言和被战胜了的语言。斯大林的公式所指的正是这些条件，因为这个公式讲道：比方说，两种语言的融合，结果不是新语言的形成，而是其中一种语言的胜利和另一种语言的失败。
    至于说到斯大林在党第十六次代表大会上的发言中论及各个语言溶合为一个共同语言时的另一个公式，那末这里所指的是另外的一个时代，即社会主义在世界范围内胜利以后的时代，在这个时代中世界帝国主义将不复存在，剥削阶级将被推翻，对民族和殖民地的压迫将被消灭，民族的隔离和互不信任将被民族的互相信任和接近所代替，民族权利的平等将被实现，压制和同化语言的政策将被取消，各民族间的合作将被建立，而各民族的语言将有在合作方式中互相丰富起来的可能。不用说，在这些条件下根本就谈不到一些语言的被压制和失败与另一些语言的胜利。在这里我们将遇到的不是两个语言——其中一个遭受失败而另一个成为斗争中的胜利者，而是好几百个民族语言——这些语言由于各个民族在经济、政治和文化方面的长期合作便首先分出最丰富的单一的区域性的语言，然后区域性的语言才溶合为一个共同的国际语言，这个语言当然既不会是德国语言，也不会是俄国语言，更不会是英国语言，而是吸取了各民族语言和各区域语言的精华的新语言。
    因此，两个不同的公式适应于两个不同的社会发展时代，而且正因为它们是与之适应的，所以这两个公式都是正确的，——每一个对于自己的时代是正确的。
    要求这两个公式不互相矛盾，要求它们不互相排斥，——这是何等地荒唐，就像要求资本主义统治时代不与社会主义统治时代相矛盾，要求社会主义和资本主义不互相排斥一样。
    书呆子和死啃书本的人把马克思主义、马克思主义个别结论和公式看作教条的汇集，而这些教条是“永远”不变的，虽然社会发展的条件已经改变了。他们认为：如果他们把这些结论和公式都背熟了，并把它们胡乱地引证一番，那末他们就能够解决任何问题，因为他们料到背熟了的结论和公式对于一切时代和国家、对于一切生活情形都是适用的。但是有这样想法的只能是那些看到马克思主义的字母而不看到它的实质、背熟马克思主义的结论和公式但不懂得它们的内容的人们。
    马克思主义是关于自然和社会的发展规律的科学，是关于被压迫和被剥削群众革命的科学，是关于社会主义在一切国家中胜利的科学，是关于共产主义社会建设的科学。马克思主义这一科学是不能停滞不前的，——它是在发展着和改进着。马克思主义在自己的发展中不能不以新的经验、新的知识而丰富起来，——因而它的个别公式和结论不能不随着时间而改变，不能不被适应于新的历史任务的新的公式和结论所代替。马克思主义不承认绝对适应于一切时代和时期的不变的结论和公式。马克思主义是一切教条主义的敌人。
