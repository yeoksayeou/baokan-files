Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 31st – The Korean people's just national liberation war against the American imperialist aggressors and their running dogs, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, has achieved remarkable results in just one month. As of July 25th, the heroic People's Army, under the wise leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, and with the enthusiastic support of the 30 million people of the entire Korea, has advanced the front line to a winding line from Mokpo on the west coast, through Suncheon, Namwon, Yeongdong, Yeongju, and Yeongdeok, liberating 54 cities, 78 counties, 851 districts, and 10,658 villages, with the capital Seoul of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea at its head. The liberated land area reaches more than 54,600 square kilometers (the total area of the southern half of Korea is more than 94,900 square kilometers), and the population reaches 12,000,503 (the total population of the southern half of Korea is 17 million).

The newly liberated areas include all of Gyeonggi Province, all of Gangwon Province, all of North and South Chungcheong Provinces, all of North Jeolla Province except for Muju and Jangsu counties, Gwangju and Mokpo cities in South Jeolla Province, and county towns such as Jangseong, Damyang, Hampyeong, Muan, and Yeonggwang, and Yeongdeok, Yeongyang, Bonghwa, Yeongju, Yecheon, and Mungyeong counties in North Gyeongsang Province. The distance of advancement is approximately 450 kilometers from Yeoyeon on the 38th parallel to Mokpo; approximately 400 kilometers from Yeoyeon to Gwangju; approximately 390 kilometers from Jeongok Village in Yeoncheon County to Suncheon; approximately 246 kilometers from Jeongok Village to Geumsan (North Jeolla Province); approximately 198 kilometers from Hwacheon to Hamchang (North Gyeongsang Province); approximately 182 kilometers from Inje to Yeongju; and approximately 215 kilometers from Yangyang to Yeongdeok.

After the heroic Korean People's Army switched to the counter-offensive, they advanced south along the Hwacheon, Yeoncheon, and Gaeseong routes with overwhelming power and thunderous momentum. Within three days, they liberated the capital city of the People's Republic of Korea, Seoul, which had been occupied for five years by the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, after the surrender of the Japanese invaders. The ever-victorious People's Army continuously and resolutely fought, liberating important enemy strongholds such as Suwon, Pyeongtaek, Cheonan, Osan, Gongju, and Daejeon in one fell swoop, and continued to advance south. With the coordinated operations of the powerful land, sea, and air forces and the cooperation of the people's guerrillas, it is only a matter of time before the entire national territory is liberated.

In one month of operations, the People's Army has completely annihilated three divisions of the traitor Lee Seung-man's puppet army's eight infantry divisions, namely the 1st, 7th, and Capital Divisions, and has almost completely annihilated the main force of the 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 8th Divisions; more than 50,000 puppet troops have been killed, wounded, and captured. The remaining puppet army strength is only more than 41,000, and there are approximately 10,000 puppet police and gendarmes. After the American imperialist aggressors' air force and army participated in the war in Uijeongbu on June 27th and south of Osan in Suwon on July 6th, their morale was low. The American troops fighting on the front lines are either annihilated if they do not surrender. The entire 24th Division of the U.S. Eighth Army has been wiped out. The remaining 25th Division and a small number of artillery units, totaling more than 17,000, are frantically constructing new defense lines along the Sangju, Andong, and Cheongsong lines in North Gyeongsang Province, attempting to fight a desperate battle in the last remaining Daegu and Busan areas.

In the past month, the initiative of the war has always been in the hands of the People's Army. The People's Army's rapid advance has shattered the enemy's defense lines time and time again. The People's Army's morale is high; while the American invading troops, according to the confessions of captured officers and soldiers, were lured by MacArthur with the bait of "returning home" to carry out the war of aggression in Korea. Facts have proven that the American army is greedy for life and afraid of death, cowardly and corrupt, and has very low combat effectiveness. The American imperialism's fate of failure in Korea is irreversible.

　　朝鲜人民军一月来获显赫战果
    歼伪军五万余名和美军一个师
    解放国土五万四千余方公里和人口一千二百万余
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义侵略者及其走狗李承晚匪帮的正义的民族解放战争，在仅仅一个月中，已获得显赫的战果。截至七月二十五日止，英勇的人民军在朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军的英明领导下，在全朝鲜三千万人民的热烈支援下，已将战线推进到自西海岸木浦，经顺天、南原、永同、荣州、盈德这样一个曲折线上，解放了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首都汉城为首的五十四个市，七十八个县，八百五十一个区，一万零六百五十八个乡。解放的土地面积达五万四千六百余方公里（按朝鲜南半部的总面积为九万四千九百余方公里），人口达一千二百万五百零三人（按朝鲜南半部的总人口为一千七百万）。
    新解放的地区，计包括京畿道全部，江原道全部，忠清南北两道全部，全罗北道茂朱长水两县以外的全部，全罗南道的光州、木浦两市，及长城、潭阳、咸平、务安、灵光等县城，庆尚北道的盈德、英阳、奉化、荣州、醴泉、闻庆等县。前进的距离，自三八线上的砺砚至木浦，约四百五十公里；自砺砚至光州约四百公里；自涟川县的全谷村到顺天约三百九十公里；自全谷村到锦山（全罗北道）达二百四十六公里；自桦川到咸昌（庆尚北道）达一百九十八公里；自麟蹄到荣州达一百八十二公里；自襄阳到盈德达二百一十五公里。
    英勇的朝鲜人民军转入反攻后，以雷霆万钧的压倒优势，沿桦川、涟川、开城三路向南进军。三天之内，就解放了被美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮在日寇投降后盘据了五年之久的人民共和国首都汉城市。攻无不克的人民军，连续地果敢作战，一鼓解放了水原、平泽、天安、乌致院、公州、大田等敌军重要据点，继续向南进军。在强大的陆海空军协同作战与人民游击队的配合下，解放全国领土只是时间问题了。
    在一个月的作战中，人民军已将卖国贼李承晚的伪军八个步兵师团中的第一、第七及首都师团等三个师团完全歼灭，第三、第五、第六、第八等师团的基本主力歼灭殆尽；毙、伤俘虏伪军五万余名。残余的伪军兵力仅剩下四万一千余名，伪警察与宪兵约一万名。美帝国主义侵略者的空军和陆军，在六月二十七日与七月六日先后在议政府和水原以南的乌山参战后，士无斗志。在前线作战的美军如不投降，即被消灭。美第八军第二十四师已全部被歼。剩下的第二十五师和少数炮兵部队只有一万七千余名，正慌张地在庆尚北道的尚州、安东、青松一线构筑新的防线，企图在仅存的大邱、釜山等地背水作战，作垂死的挣扎。
    在过去的一个月中，战争的主动权始终握在人民军的手里。人民军的神速进军，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的防线。人民军士气高昂；而美国侵略军队，按照俘虏官兵的自供，是被麦克阿瑟以“还乡”为饵，诱骗到朝鲜来进行侵略战争的。事实证明，美国军队是贪生怕死，怯懦腐败，战斗力很低的。美帝国主义在朝鲜的失败命运是无法挽回的。
