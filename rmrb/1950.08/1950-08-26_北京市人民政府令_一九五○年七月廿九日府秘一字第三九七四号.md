    Article 1: These rules are formulated to protect private trees in the urban area.
    Article 2: Anyone who steals or damages other people's trees shall be punished as damaging people's property.
    Article 3: Anyone who wishes to cut down their own trees must obtain a certificate from the local police station or village government (certifying property rights and reasons) and apply to the district office or district government for a "logging permit."
    Those who apply to cut down trees privately planted on public land or cut down more than five trees at a time must be approved by the Construction Bureau for the urban area after being reported by the district office, and approved by the Suburban Work Committee for the suburban area after being reported by the district people's government, before a permit can be issued.
    Article 4: "Logging permits" shall not be issued unless one of the following conditions is met:
    \t1. A large part of the tree is affected by pests or diseases, or has already withered and died.
    \t2. It does obstruct traffic, power lines, or buildings, or the branches are tilted and there is a danger of injuring people or livestock.
    \t3. There are legitimate reasons and sufficient evidence to prove that it is indeed necessary to use the land occupied by the trees for more beneficial construction.
    \t4. The diameter of the tree trunk at one meter from the ground has reached 40 centimeters or more, and it can be used for manufacturing equipment, and the felling will not cause significant obstruction to the environment.
    \t5. Other reasons deemed appropriate by the district office through the Construction Bureau or the district people's government through the Suburban Work Committee.
    Article 5: For trees approved for felling for the reasons in Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 4 of these rules, the original applicant must replant new trees in the original felling location within one year, and be responsible for their growth.
    Article 6: Applications to cut down trees of special value for scenery, scenic spots, wind prevention, flood control, water conservation, etc., shall be handled separately and shall not be subject to the provisions of these rules.
    Article 7: The private ownership of trees that have been approved as temporarily not to be cut down shall not be infringed upon. When they meet the conditions for felling, their owners may still apply for approval to cut them down.
    Article 8: If a tree itself has localized pests or diseases, or its branches and leaves are withered, or it slightly obstructs traffic, power lines, or buildings, and needs to be pruned, the necessary branches and leaves may be removed on one's own, and there shall be no opportunistic indiscriminate felling.
    Article 9: The Public Security Bureau shall be responsible for the enforcement of these rules, and may impose appropriate sanctions on those who cut down trees without permission, depending on the severity of the circumstances.
    Article 10: Citizens of this city have the right to report private felling, theft, and destruction of trees.
    Article 11: Those citizens who are enthusiastic about planting trees and afforestation and achieve significant results may be commended as appropriate. Specific measures shall be formulated separately.
    Article 12: These rules may be amended at any time if there are any omissions.
    Article 13: These rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.
