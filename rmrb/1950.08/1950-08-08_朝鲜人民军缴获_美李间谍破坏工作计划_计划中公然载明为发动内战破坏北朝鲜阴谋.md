Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th: Pyongyang newspapers published on the 4th, on most of the second and third pages, an extremely confidential document left behind by the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee bandits when they fled in panic. This document was formulated by the US and Syngman Rhee reactionaries to launch the Korean civil war and sabotage the northern half of the Republic, and is called "1950 Intelligence Work Plan." The plan was discovered in the "Third Section of the Army Intelligence Bureau" of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, which openly stated that its purpose was "to destroy North Korea through secret warfare in order to recover lost territory."

The plan stipulates: investigating the secrets of North Korea's military industry, transportation, trade, education, culture, and other aspects; dispatching core espionage personnel with "excellent" skills; and buying off merchants, barbers, photographers, train conductors, drivers, mess hall cooks, handymen, etc. to act as spies, infiltrate major North Korean agencies, or buying off wavering elements within the agencies to engage in sabotage and burning of railways, important factories, enterprises, Party and government agencies, buildings of social organizations, and cultural facilities such as radio stations, newspapers, schools, and churches.

The book also plans to assassinate leaders of the Republic's Party, government, military, and mass organizations, and even plans to spread bacteria and poison in canteens, wells, and rivers to kill large numbers of residents. The book also states that it will use methods such as wasting daily necessities and counterfeiting banknotes to disrupt the social economy. The total amount of the budget for realizing the above-mentioned conspiracy is as high as 100,412,000 US dollars.
