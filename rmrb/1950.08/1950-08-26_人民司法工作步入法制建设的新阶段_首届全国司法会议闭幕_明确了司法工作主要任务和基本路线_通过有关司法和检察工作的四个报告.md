Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The first National Judicial Conference, lasting seventeen days, successfully concluded on August 11th. This conference was jointly convened by the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Justice, and the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government. Prior to the conference, the four agencies organized judicial work inspection groups to go to the Northeast and North China regions to understand the actual situation of local judicial work, preparing conditions for holding this conference. During the conference, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government Zhu De, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Dong Biwu, Deputy Director of the Political and Legal Committee Peng Zhen, and others attended the meeting to instruct on the principles of people's judicial work. The conference followed the basic policy of Article 17 of the Common Program, "Abolish all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppress the people, formulate laws and decrees to protect the people, and establish a people's judicial system." It discussed and adopted the report by Chen Shaoyu, Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, "Several Issues Concerning Current Judicial Work," the "Report on Trial Work of the People's Courts" by Wu Gaizhi, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, the "Report on Current Judicial Administration Work" by Shi Liang, Minister of Justice, and the "Report on the Tasks and Work of the People's Procuratorate" by Li Liuru, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate. According to the spirit of the above reports, the conference organized specialized business groups to study and discuss several draft regulations (such as the Provisional Organizational Regulations of the People's Courts, Outline of Criminal Law, General Principles of Litigation Procedures, Provisional Regulations on Prisoner Rehabilitation, Company Law, etc.).

The conference was opened by Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court. He pointed out that the convening of this conference marks a new stage in the legal system construction of people's judicial work. Chen Shaoyu, Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, then delivered a report entitled "Several Issues Concerning Current Judicial Work." He explained the importance of judicial work from various aspects, elaborated on the scientific understanding of the class essence of law, focused on putting forward the principles of establishing a people's judicial system, and briefly explained several viewpoints on the policies for criminal and civil cases. Finally, Director Chen cited Chairman Mao's instruction that "the important thing is to be good at learning," calling on everyone to master the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, be good at learning, establish and enhance the class position, mass viewpoint, and realistic work style of serving the people, in order to improve knowledge and improve judicial work.

Wu Gaizhi, Vice President of the Supreme People's Court, in his report on "Trial Work of the People's Courts," focused on explaining the tasks and trial guidelines of the People's Courts, and proposed the principles of establishing a system of levels of trials, a system of appeals, a system of open trials, a system of jury trials, a system of circuit trials and on-the-spot trials, a system of mediation, and a system of propaganda and education. He also pointed out that establishing and improving court organizations, enriching and improving the political and professional level of cadres, and quickly clearing backlog cases are the three tasks that need to be done urgently.

Shi Liang, Minister of Justice, pointed out in her report on "Current Judicial Administration Work": In the future, great efforts should be made to establish and improve judicial institutions at all levels in a step-by-step and focused manner; strive to train new people's judicial cadres in three to five years; correct the guiding principles of prison administration, reform the prison system, and strengthen prison work; and strengthen propaganda and education work in people's judicial work.

Li Liuru, Deputy Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, in his "Report on the Tasks and Work of the People's Procuratorate," gave a brief explanation of the tasks of the People's Procuratorate in the state power, the division of labor and cooperation between the People's Procuratorate and the People's Courts, the People's Supervisory Committee, and the People's Public Security Organs, as well as the current work and requirements of the People's Procuratorate.

In their speeches, leaders of the Central People's Government gave clear instructions on the main tasks and basic line of judicial work. Vice Chairman Zhu De pointed out that the judicial work of New China should be based on the Common Program. Its main task is to fight against counter-revolutionaries, eliminate counter-revolutionaries, and protect the four classes of New China. He also pointed out that judicial work is a glorious and long-term task. Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out that the central task of the court's trial work should be to handle counter-revolutionary cases, cases of sabotaging national economic construction, and other important cases. The People's Courts should free up their strength to complete these central tasks. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out that the people's judicial workers are the protectors of the people's rights and interests, and also the suppressors of reactionary elements. Therefore, they must stand on the position of the people's democratic dictatorship and distinguish between enemies and friends, that is, recognize who is being subjected to dictatorship and who is enjoying democracy. Vice Premier Dong Biwu gave instructions on the importance of judicial work and its position in the people's democratic dictatorship, saying: "We are a country that has achieved revolutionary victory, a country of people's democratic dictatorship. If we say that the sharpest weapon of the people's democratic dictatorship is not judicial work, it is also the second most important." "In the armed struggle against counter-revolutionaries, of course, armed forces are the most important. In the early stage of the revolutionary victory, armed forces are still of great importance. However, once society is free from the influence of war, judicial work and public security work become the most important tools in the hands of the people's state to deal with counter-revolutionaries and maintain social order." Deputy Director Peng Zhen pointed out that the basic line of judicial work is the mass line. He also explained the consistency between the mass line and legal coercion in judicial work.

The conference also invited Soviet legal experts Sudarikov and Bekov to introduce the tasks and experiences of Soviet socialist judicial and procuratorial work.

The conference received a total of 121 proposals from representatives from various regions, all of which were answered at the meeting or sent to relevant agencies for processing.

The conference was closed by Minister Shi Liang. In her closing speech, she gave a comprehensive summary of the conference. She pointed out that the various reports adopted by the conference and the repeated discussions by the representatives clarified the boundaries between the old and new judicial work, and outlined a brand-new people's judicial system, which is the main gain of the conference. Finally, she emphasized that everyone should have full confidence in doing a good job in people's judicial work. Difficulties in the work exist, but they are difficulties in development. As long as everyone unites and works together in accordance with the guidelines of the conference, they can gradually overcome difficulties and complete this glorious and arduous task.

    【新华社二十五日讯】第一届全国司法会议，历时十七天，已于八月十一日圆满结束。此次会议是由中央人民政府最高人民法院、最高人民检察署、司法部和法制委员会共同召开的。会前，四个机关曾组织司法工作视察团，分赴东北和华北两地区，了解地方司法工作实况，为开好这次会议准备了条件。会议期间，中央人民政府朱德副主席、刘少奇副主席、政务院周恩来总理和董必武副总理、政治法律委员会彭真副主任等，均曾莅会指示人民司法工作的原则。会议遵循共同纲领第十七条“废除国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，制定保护人民的法律、法令，建立人民司法制度”的基本方针，讨论并通过了法制委员会陈绍禹主任委员“关于目前司法工作的几个问题”的报告、最高人民法院吴溉之副院长的“人民法院审判工作报告”、司法部史良部长“关于目前司法行政工作报告”和最高人民检察署李六如副检察长的“人民检察任务及工作报告”等四个报告。根据以上报告的精神，会议曾组织了专门性质的业务小组，分别研究和讨论了几个法规草案（如人民法院暂行组织条例、刑法大纲、诉讼程序通则、犯人改造暂行条例、公司法等草案）。
    会议由最高人民法院沈钧儒院长致开幕词。他指出这次会议的召开标志人民司法工作步入法制建设的新阶段，继由法制委员会陈绍禹主任委员作《关于目前司法工作的几个问题》的报告，他从各方面说明了司法工作的重要性，详细阐述了对法律的阶级本质的科学认识，有重点地提出了建立人民司法制度的原则，扼要地解释了对于刑事、民事案件的政策中的几个观点问题。最后，陈主任委员引证毛主席“重要的问题在善于学习”的指示，号召大家掌握批评和自我批评的武器，善于学习，建立和增强为人民服务的阶级立场、群众观点和实事求是的作风，以便达到提高知识水平改进司法工作的目的。
    最高人民法院吴溉之副院长在“人民法院审判工作”的报告中，着重说明了人民法院的任务和审判方针，提出了建立审级制度、上诉制度、公开审判制度、陪审制度、巡回审判和就地审判制度、调解制度、宣教制度等的原则。并指出了建立和健全法院组织机构、充实和提高干部的政治和业务水平、迅速清理积案，是目前急须做好的三件工作。
    司法部史良部长在《关于目前司法行政工作》的报告中指出：今后应用极大力量有步骤有重点地建立和健全各级司法机构；争取三、五年内培养出新的人民司法干部；端正狱政工作方针、改革监狱制度和加强监狱工作；加强人民司法工作中的宣教工作。
    最高人民检察署李六如副检察长的“人民检察任务及工作报告”，将人民检察署在国家政权中的任务，人民检察署与人民法院、人民监察委员会和人民公安机关等的分工合作关系，人民检察署的目前工作和要求等，作了扼要的说明。
    中央人民政府各首长在讲话中，分别对司法工作的主要任务和基本路线作了明确的指示。朱德副主席指出：新中国的司法工作，应该以共同纲领为依据。它的主要任务是向反革命分子作斗争，消灭反革命分子，保护新中国的四个阶级。并指出司法工作是一个光荣的长期的任务。刘少奇副主席指出：法院审判工作的中心任务应该是处理反革命案、破坏国家经济建设案及其他重要案件。人民法院应腾出力量来完成这些中心任务。周恩来总理指出：人民司法工作者，是人民权益的保护者，也是反动分子的镇压者。因此，必须站在人民民主专政的立场上，分清敌友，即认清对谁专政，对谁民主。董必武副总理就司法工作的重要性及其在人民民主专政中的地位指示说：“我们是取得革命胜利的国家，是人民民主专政的国家。人民民主专政的最锐利的武器，如果说司法工作不是第一位的话，也是第二位。”“在跟反革命作武装斗争的时候，当然武装是第一位。在革命胜利的初期，武装也还有很大的重要性。可是社会一经脱离了战争的影响，那末司法工作和公安工作，就成为人民国家手中对付反革命，维持社会秩序最重要的工具。”彭真副主任指出：司法工作的基本路线，是群众路线。他并说明了司法工作中的群众路线与法律强制的一致性。
    会议并邀请苏联法律专家苏达里可夫和贝可夫分别介绍了苏联社会主义的司法和检察工作的任务和经验。
    会议共收到各地代表的提案一百二十一件，均已分别在会上作了解答或送有关机关处理。
    会议由史良部长致闭会词。她在闭会词中，对会议作了综合性的总结。她指出这次会议通过的各项报告和代表的反复讨论，划清了新旧司法工作的界限，把崭新的人民司法制度划出了一个轮廓，这是会议的主要收获。最后，她强调指出：大家都应具备做好人民司法工作的充分信心。工作中的困难是存在的，但是是发展中的困难。只要大家遵照会议的方针团结一致，共同努力，即可逐步克服困难，完成这一光荣而艰巨的工作任务。
