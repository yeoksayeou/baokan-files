Beijing Telecommunications Bureau
    New Regulations for Installing Telephones: Installation and Deposit Fees Can Be Paid in Installments
    In order to accommodate users who may find it difficult to pay the full installation and deposit fees for telephone installation at once, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau has newly established installment payment methods for installation and deposit fees. These methods have been implemented since August 1st. Any private residence or private legitimate industrial and commercial user installing an ordinary telephone within the basic business area, with a material distance of no more than 150 meters, is eligible. Before applying for installation, such users should find two shopkeepers who already have telephones installed to act as guarantors. They should then fill out an application form and guarantee letter at the bureau's Factory Alley business office outside Hepingmen. After the bureau approves the guarantee, installation will be arranged. In addition to the installation and deposit fees, which can be paid in three installments within three months, all other fees, such as monthly rental fees, must still be paid as stipulated. For detailed information, please call the bureau's service desk at 30900 or 05.
