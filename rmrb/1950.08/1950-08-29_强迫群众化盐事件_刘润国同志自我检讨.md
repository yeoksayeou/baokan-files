Forced Salt Crystallization Incident

Comrade Liu Runguo's Self-Criticism

Editor Comrade:

The criticism of the Xiaoshentang Branch of the Hangu Saltworks Management Office for forcing the masses to crystallize salt, which was published on the People's Garden on August 9th, is accepted by me.

This year, the Changlu Salt Affairs Bureau called on salt farmers to "increase production and ensure salt quality." In order to complete the tasks assigned by the higher authorities, I made serious deviations in the implementation of the work, causing losses to national tax revenue and people's wealth. This is a big mistake. The main reason for this mistake is: I committed the error of being impatient and careless in my work. I did not analyze the problems in light of the specific circumstances, and I adopted crude and coercive methods to raise the salt quality to the best standard. When the salt crystallization incident occurred, I did not accept the workers' opinions. I thought I was doing the right thing and did not consider the losses after the salt crystallization. I distorted the instructions of the higher authorities, only wanting to over fulfill the quality and quantity of our unit and make outstanding achievements. As a result, deviations occurred, causing losses to the interests of the masses. In summary, I committed the error of commandism and became detached from the masses. In addition to requesting the higher authorities to impose a penalty, I will make every effort to overcome my shortcomings in the future, avoid repeating the same mistakes, and hope that readers will provide assistance at any time.

Xiaoshentang Branch Liu Runguo

　　强迫群众化盐事件
    刘润国同志自我检讨编辑同志：
    八月九日人民园地上刊出了对汉沽盐场管理处小神堂分场强迫群众化盐的批评，我接受这个批评。
    今年长芦盐务管理局号召盐户“提高产量、保证盐质”。我为了完成上级所布置的任务，在执行工作中发生了严重的偏向，使国家税收、人民财富遭受了损失。这是一个很大的错误。产生这个错误的主要原因是：我在工作中犯了急性病，粗枝大叶，没有结合具体情况分析问题，采取生硬的强迫的办法将盐质提高到最好标准。在发生化盐事件时，又没接受工人的意见，自己认为做得很对，没有考虑到化盐后的损失。我曲解了上级的指示，光想使本单位的质与量超额完成，做出突出的成绩，结果发生偏向，使群众利益受到损失。综上所述，我是犯了命令主义的错误，脱离了群众。除呈请上级给予处分外，今后将尽最大努力克服缺点，不再重蹈覆辙，并希读者随时给予帮助。
