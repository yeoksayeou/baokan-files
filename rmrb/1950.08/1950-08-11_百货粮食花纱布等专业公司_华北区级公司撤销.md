　　Specialized Companies for Merchandise, Grain, Cotton Yarn, etc.
　　North China Regional Companies Abolished
　　[This newspaper report] Upon the submission of the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has approved the complete abolition of the North China regional companies for merchandise, grain, cotton yarn, and other specialized companies by the end of July.
　　The respective specialized head offices have been established successively in Beijing and Tianjin. Simultaneously, because the North China regional companies lack the cooperation of government at the same level, in fact, it is difficult for them to exert their due role. Therefore, there is no need for them to exist independently. After the abolition of the North China regional companies, their cadres, property, archives, accounts, etc., will be taken over separately by the respective specialized head offices.

　　百货粮食花纱布等专业公司
    华北区级公司撤销
    【本报讯】中央人民政府贸易部顷呈准政务院财政经济委员会，在七月底将百货、粮食、花纱布等各专业公司华北区级公司全部撤销。
    各专业总公司已在京、津先后成立，同时华北区级公司因无同级政权之配合，事实上很难发挥其应有作用，故无单独存在必要。华北区级公司撤销后，其干部、财产、档案、账册等均交由各该专业总公司分别接收。
