[News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency]: Workers Cai Enbo and Song Yulin of the Iron Smelting Department, and worker Liu Qi of the Coking Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, in the upsurge of the New Record Movement, improved their working methods, eliminated work-related injuries, and guaranteed the health of iron prying and paint-making workers.

Prying iron is a very important task on the blast furnace in the Iron Smelting Department. When tapping iron, after the molten iron is poured into the sand mold, the workers sprinkle a thin layer of sand on the fiery, newly solidified iron and immediately begin prying. In the hot summer, workers often fainted while prying iron. Moreover, a drop of molten iron or a piece of hot iron could burn people. Carelessness and slipping would result in burns all over the body. For more than a decade, workers had been working like this, and almost every worker had scars from burns on their bodies and feet.

After liberation, the output of iron increased day by day, and the number of sand molds increased from a dozen rows to more than thirty rows. However, the number of blast furnace workers only increased by three or four, greatly increasing the intensity of labor. During the "May 1st" increase production campaign, eleven workers fainted on April 27th alone. More than twenty workers fainted in May. Other work-related injuries were not even counted.

Cai Enbo, a blast furnace worker, under the call of the higher authorities to "improve quality and reduce work-related injuries," after seeing eleven fellow workers faint at once, kept thinking about the problem. After more than twenty days, he began experimenting on June 21st, painstakingly using his hands to gradually shape the sand molds into new forms. He made five in total, but only three were filled after tapping the iron, and the experiment failed. Workers with unclear understanding started talking, and the workers who were helping Cai Enbo became discouraged. But Cai Enbo was not discouraged and continued his research. During the second experiment, after everyone had made the molds, he modified twenty-five of them himself. After tapping the iron, only about seven-tenths were filled. On July 10th, Song Yulin, Yao Shikui, Wang Liyuan, and others who were studying at the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Training Class returned to the factory. They immediately talked to him and encouraged him to continue his research. At the same time, they mobilized everyone to think of solutions. All three shifts were mobilized. Bao Shizhen, Ji Yumin, and all the workers of Blast Furnace Shift A offered some suggestions. Song Yulin also suggested a better method, so that the iron would break easily after it solidified, without the need to pry it. After everyone's research and supplementation, the initial experiment was successful on July 20th. At present, most of the blast furnace uses new molds. After tapping the iron, it is only necessary to pour water on the iron to cool it and hammer it open, without having to pry the iron on the hot iron. Work-related injuries can be basically eliminated, and waste products have also been reduced a lot. Now some people are studying how to completely eliminate scrap iron.

The Jiao You [Coal Tar] Workshop of the Coking Department used to prepare black paint by putting hard asphalt from the distillation furnace into the pool, cooling it, smashing it into pieces, and carrying it to the asphalt storage. When making black paint, the asphalt blocks were carried to the black paint furnace for heating and preparation. This method was both cumbersome and harmful to the health of the workers. Preparation in the black paint furnace took twenty-four hours and required constant stirring. Not only was the smell very bad, but the oil smoke damaged the workers' faces, and the sun would hurt them. When smashing asphalt blocks, the splinters would splash on the skin, causing small asphalt tumors to grow. Recently, the factory launched a New Record Movement, and employees put forward many rationalization proposals. Gu Guocheng, the technical assistant of the workshop, discussed with worker Liu Qi (a Communist Party member) whether black paint could be prepared in the distillation furnace. Based on the spirit of Gu Guocheng's proposal, Liu Qi thought for two days and came up with a method of using the crystallization pans near the distillation furnace to put the hard asphalt from the distillation furnace into the pans, cool it down, and then prepare the black paint. In this way, there was no need for separate heating or carrying back and forth. Other workers also agreed with his opinion. The experiment was successful after two attempts. Since mid-July, this method has been used to make black paint, reducing the suffering of workers smashing asphalt blocks and shortening the time workers were exposed to oil smoke.

It used to take twenty-four hours and four hundred kilograms of coal slime to make black paint in the black paint furnace. Only five tons were produced per furnace. Fourteen workers were needed for firing, loading the furnace, and transporting. Now, nine tons are produced at a time, taking only three hours and two people. According to the workshop's production of sixty tons of black paint in July, more than one thousand catties of millet can be saved in labor and material costs per month. (Zhang Mingyi, Lu Niangao)

### 石景山钢铁厂炼铁部工人  改进工作方法消灭公伤  撬铁制漆工人健康得到保障

　　石景山钢铁厂炼铁部工人
    改进工作方法消灭公伤
    撬铁制漆工人健康得到保障
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：石景山钢铁厂炼铁部工人蔡恩波、宋玉林和炼焦部工人刘琪，在新纪录运动热潮中，改进工作方法，消灭了公伤（因公受伤），保障了撬铁、制漆工人的健康。
    撬铁是炼铁部高炉上一个很重要的工作，出铁时，在铁水注入沙型后，工人在火红的初凝的铁上，撒下一层薄薄的沙子，就立刻动手撬。在炎热的夏天，撬铁时常发生晕倒的现象。而且一滴铁水，一块热铁都会烫伤人。一不小心，滑倒了就要烫的满身是伤。十几年来，工人一直这样的工作着，几乎每一个工人的身上、脚上都有被烫坏的伤疤。
    解放后，铁的产量一天天的增加，沙型也由十几排增加到三十几排，但是高炉的工人只增加了三、四人，劳动强度大大增加了。在“五一”增产运动中，四月二十七日一次就晕倒了十一位工人。五月份晕倒二十多人。其他公伤还未计算在内。
    高炉工人蔡恩波，在上级“提高质量，减少公伤”的号召下，看到那次一次晕倒了十一位工友，就一直琢磨这个问题。经过二十多天，在六月二十一日开始试验，和两三个工人辛苦地用手一点一点的将沙型拍成新的形式。一共作了五条。但是出铁后只灌了三条，失败了。认识不清的工人出来说话了，帮助蔡恩波的几个工人灰心了。但是蔡恩波没有灰心，继续研究。第二次试验时，在大家打好模子后他自己动手改了二五根，出铁后，也只灌进了十分之七。七月十日在北京市委干训班学习的宋玉林、姚士奎、王利元等回厂，他们马上找他谈，鼓励他继续研究。同时，他们还发动大家想办法。三班都动起来了。高炉甲班工人保世祯、季玉敏和全班工人，提了些办法。宋玉林也提了个更好的办法，使铁水凝固后，一敲就断，不用再撬铁了。经过大家的研究补充，在七月二十日初步试验成功。目前高炉大部采用了新的模子，出铁后，只要用水将铁浇滚，用锤敲开就行了，不必在火热的铁上撬铁了。公伤可以基本上消灭，废品也减少了许多。现在又有人在研究如何彻底消灭废铁了。
    炼焦部焦油场配制黑漆，以前是从蒸馏炉里把硬沥青放到池子里，冷却后，砸成块，抬到沥青库去，等做黑漆时，再把沥青块抬到黑漆炉去加热配制。这种做法，既费事，又损害工人健康。在黑漆炉里配制要用二十四小时，需要时常搅弄，不只臭得很，而且油烟把工人脸都薰坏了，日光一晒就痛。在砸沥青块时，碎沫溅到皮肤上，就长小沥青瘤。最近该厂展开新纪录运动，职工提出了很多合理化建议。该场技术助理员顾国成和工人刘琪（共产党员）商量是不是可以在蒸馏炉里面配制黑漆。刘琪根据顾国成提议的精神，琢磨了两天，想出利用蒸馏炉附近结晶盘的办法，把硬沥青从蒸馏炉放到盘里，冷一下，就配制黑漆。这样，就不用另行加热，也不用抬来抬去了。别的工人也赞成他的意见。试验两次就成功了。从七月中起，就用这个办法做黑漆，减少了砸沥青块工人的痛苦，缩短了油烟薰人的时间。
    以前用黑漆炉做黑漆，用二十四小时，烧四百公斤煤泥。一炉只出五吨。烧火、装炉、抬运一共要用十四个工。现在一次出九吨，只用三小时，两个人。按七月份该场做黑漆六十吨计算，一个月可节省工料费一千多斤小米。（张明义，卢念高）
