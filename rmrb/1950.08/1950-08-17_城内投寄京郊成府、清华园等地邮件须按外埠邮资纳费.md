Mail sent from within the city of Beijing to areas in the near suburbs of Beijing, such as Chenfu, Qinghuayuan, Wanshoushan, and Haidian, must be charged at out-of-town rates because these areas are not within the Beijing Postal Bureau's delivery area. If stamps are affixed according to the local Beijing postage standard, the post office will treat the mail as underpaid and charge the recipient twice the amount of the unpaid postage.

　　城内投寄京郊成府、清华园等地邮件须按外埠邮资纳费
    自京市城区寄往北京近郊成府、清华园、万寿山、海甸等地邮件，因不属于京市邮局投递区范围，须按外埠邮资纳费。如照本市邮资标准贴邮票，邮局即按欠资邮件处理，向收件人加倍索取未付足的邮费。
