    Denouncing US Imperialist Conspiracy in Southeast Asia
    Pointing Out US Imperialist Attempt to Turn Indochina into a Springboard for Aggression
    [News Agency Report] Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: TASS, Moscow: On the 1st, Marinin published an article in Pravda commenting on the conspiratorial activities of the American aggressors in Southeast Asia. Marinin stated: The US government "special" missions successively visited Southeast Asian countries. For example, the Jessup mission was active in Southeast Asia at the beginning of this year. Subsequently, the Griffin mission followed. And finally, a new mission is currently touring Southeast Asia. It is led by State Department official Mr. Melby, and its members include General Erskine, a representative of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff.
    The leaders of the mission are doing their utmost to publicize its ambitions, goals, and plans. Erskine said: The information the mission recently observed in Indochina is "of great strategic significance to the entire Southeast Asia." Erskine also believes that aerial surveys must be conducted in appropriate border areas of Vietnam.
    Marinin emphasized that the actual "suggestions" made by the Melby-Erskine mission also stem from the desire to turn Indochina into a springboard, which the US ruling clique can use to implement adventurous policies towards Southeast Asian countries. Therefore, the initial plan is for the US permanent mission in Indochina to include hundreds of staff members, including a large number of personnel led by military attachés from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Subsequently, the Marine Corps will also be used to "protect" this mission.
    Marinin concluded by pointing out that the US ruling clique is directly threatening Indochina. Marinin emphasized that the people of Asian countries are increasingly aware of this threat, and they are intensifying their struggle against imperialist aggressors for independence and freedom.

　　真理报发表马里宁专文
    斥美帝在东南亚阴谋活动
    指出美帝图把印度支那变成侵略跳板
    【本报讯】据新华社三日讯：塔斯社莫斯科讯：马里宁一日在真理报上撰文评论美国侵略者在东南亚的阴谋活动。马里宁称：美国政府“特别”使团相继访问东南亚各国。例如耶塞普率领的使团在今年年初就在东南亚活动。随后，葛里芬使团继之而来。而最后，目前新的使团正在周游东南亚。它由国务院官员梅尔拜率领，其成员包括美国参谋总部代表厄斯琴将军。
    该使团的领袖们极力宣传它的野心、目的和计划。厄斯琴说道：使团最近在印度支那观察所得的情报，“对整个东南亚是具有重大战略意义的”。厄斯琴并认为必须对越南适当的边境地区进行空中调查。
    马里宁着重指出：梅尔拜——厄斯琴使团所作的实际的“建议”，也是出于要把印度支那变成跳板，以便美国统治集团可以利用它来实行对东南亚各国的冒险政策。因此，首先计划美国常驻印度支那的使团应包括几百名工作人员，其中有一大批陆、海、空军武官所率领的人员。随后，还要用海军陆战队来“保护”这个使团。
    马里宁在结语中指出：美国的统治集团已直接威胁着印度支那。马里宁着重说：亚洲各国人民越来越感觉到这种威胁，而且他们正加紧为争取独立与自由反对帝国主义侵略者而斗争。
