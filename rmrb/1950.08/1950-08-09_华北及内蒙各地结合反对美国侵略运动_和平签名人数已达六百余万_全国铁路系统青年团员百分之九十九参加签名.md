Xinhua News Agency, 7th: In North China and Inner Mongolia, the number of people signing for peace has rapidly increased during the movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. According to statistics from July 15th, the number of signatures in North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (excluding Beijing and Tianjin) was 3,045,867. After launching the movement against American aggression, according to recent statistics, the number of signatories has reached 6,143,800, more than double the previous figure. This includes 2.5 million in Hebei Province, 1.27 million in Shanxi Province, 1.31 million in Chahar Province, 380,000 in Suiyuan Province, 318,000 in Pingyuan Province, and 365,800 in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

During the movement against American aggression, peace organizations and people's groups in various regions used various methods to widely promote the peace signature campaign, which was a crucial key to advancing the movement further. For example, Baoding City in Hebei Province held widespread mass gatherings, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a forum with more than 800 workers. The Municipal Youth League organization also held current affairs lectures for more than 1,000 young students and faculty members. The Zhangjiakou Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration organized more than 40 propagandists to go deep into workers' residential areas for publicity. The branch's trade union also organized propaganda teams to go to various stations along the railway to promote the campaign to passengers and the vast number of farmers. The city's radio station also invited experts to broadcast current affairs for several consecutive days. Xinxiang City in Pingyuan Province had a propaganda team of more than 1,300 people, posting slogans, wall newspapers, and cartoons against American imperialist aggression throughout the city. Street loudspeakers and blackboards constantly reported the victorious news of the Korean people to the citizens. In Guihua City, publicity was carried out on a district basis, using discussions and forums.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Over 51,000 Youth League members in the national railway system have signed the peace declaration, accounting for more than 99% of the total number of League members in the railway system. In addition to actively signing themselves, they have also adopted various methods to promote the campaign to approximately 100,000 employees, family members, and passengers. For example, Youth League members at Taiyuan South and North Stations and the machinery factory mobilized over 95% of the young workers there to sign. The Youth League organization at Luoyang Station organized propaganda groups to promote the signature campaign at small stations along the line. The Youth League branch at Harbin Railway Station set up a loudspeaker at the station to explain the significance of the peace signature campaign to passengers. As trains entered the station, League members immediately solicited signatures from passengers. Zhang Zhonghou, a model League member from the Qiqihar Train Section, and the members of his chartered car group actively promoted the campaign to passengers through slogans, catchphrases, broadcasts, and individual explanations. By the end of June, they had collected over 13,000 signatures from passengers.

    【新华社七日讯】华北各地及内蒙自治区的保卫和平签名人数，在反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动中有急遽的增加。据七月十五日的统计，华北及内蒙自治区（北京、天津两市除外）的签名人数为三百零四万五千八百六十七人；在开展了反对美国侵略运动之后，据最近的统计，签名者已达六百一十四万三千八百人，即增加一倍以上。其中河北省二百五十万人，山西省一百二十七万人，察哈尔省一百三十一万人，绥远省三十八万人，平原省三十一万八千人，内蒙自治区三十六万五千八百人。
    在反对美国侵略运动中，各地保卫世界和平的组织和人民团体都运用各种方式广泛展开了和平签名的宣传活动，这是把运动推进一步的一个重要关键。如河北省保定市曾普遍召开群众性的集会，市总工会并召开了八百余名工人的座谈会，市青年团组织亦举办了一千余青年学生和教职员的时事讲座。天津铁路管理局张家口分局组织了四十余名宣传员深入工人住宅区进行宣传。该局工会并组织宣传队分赴铁路沿线各站向旅客及广大农民宣传。该市广播电台亦连日请专人播讲时事。平原省新乡市有一千三百余人的宣传队，在全市各处张贴反对美帝国主义侵略的标语、壁报及漫画等。各街头的播音器和黑板报不断向市民报告朝鲜人民的胜利消息。归绥市以区为单位，以漫谈、座谈等方式进行宣传。
    【新华社四日讯】全国铁路系统中的青年团员已有五万一千余人在和平宣言上签名，占铁路系统中团员总数的百分之九十九以上。他们除自己积极签名外，并采用各种方式宣传职工家属和往来旅客约十万人参加签名。如太原南、北站及机厂的青年团员发动了该处百分之九十五以上的青年工人签了名。洛阳站的青年团组织组织宣传组到沿线各小站宣传签名运动。哈尔滨车站青年团支部，在车站上设立了广播器，向往来乘客讲解和平签名运动的意义。列车进站后团员即向车上乘客征集签名。齐齐哈尔列车段的模范团员张忠厚领导的包车组组员们用标语、口号、广播、个别讲解等方式，积极地对乘客进行宣传。他们在六月底即已征集了一万三千余名旅客签名。
