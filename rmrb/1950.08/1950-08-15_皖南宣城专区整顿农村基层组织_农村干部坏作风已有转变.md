　　Southern Anhui Xuancheng Special District Rectifies Rural Grassroots Organizations
　　Bad Work Styles of Rural Cadres Have Begun to Change

　　[Xuancheng News from this newspaper] The Xuancheng Special District in Southern Anhui is actively rectifying and reforming rural grassroots organizations (including the government and farmers' associations) to create conditions for land reform after the autumn harvest. After liberation, with the development of various tasks in this special district, rural grassroots organizations were gradually established. However, due to the heavy tasks at the time, the lack of cadres, unfamiliarity with the situation, and the lack of understanding of the various policies of the People's Government by the broad masses, many bad elements took the opportunity to infiltrate village governments and farmers' associations, manipulating and controlling them, committing all kinds of evils, suppressing the masses, failing to implement government policies, and greatly affecting the relationship between the government and the people.

　　In many rural grassroots organizations, various unhealthy tendencies in politics, ideology, and work style have formed due to impure composition. In seven villages in Xuancheng's Eighth District, nine former puppet Bao chiefs became cadres. In Liu Village, Guangde County, due to collusion between bad elements and bandits, a gathering to rob the grain depot occurred in April this year. In the village governments of Nanling, Dangtu, Langxi, and other counties, there were "Big Sword Society" leaders, Kuomintang members, puppet soldiers, puppet Bao chiefs, landlord elements, etc. Their work style was extremely bad, and corruption and waste were quite serious. Some village cadres privately increased the apportioned figures to the masses during grain requisitioning, indulged in eating, drinking, and misusing public funds, and arbitrarily started fires to eat public meals. The phenomenon of coercive orders and detachment from the masses was also very serious. During the dike repair in Dangtu County, every village near the Dagong Dike had a prison and arbitrarily detained the masses. In addition, some cadres were enticed by landlords and bullies and directly or indirectly became protectors of their interests. Even worse, some bad elements raped women.

　　In response to the above situation, the Xuancheng Special Commissioner's Office and the CPC Xuancheng Prefectural Committee instructed various counties last year to pay attention to the rectification of village-level grassroots organizations. From the beginning of December last year to the end of June this year, after half a year of effort, the phenomenon of impure village governments in various places has been improved. And gained a lot of experience, laying the foundation for future government building and land reform after the autumn harvest.

　　In the process of rectifying village governments, various localities combined with the central work, and adopted two methods of partial adjustment and basic reorganization according to different circumstances. The former, partial adjustment, accounted for the majority. Xuancheng's Fifth District combined the dike repair work to rectify three village governments, cleared up corruption incidents, and dealt with bad cadres. The rectification method was: doing preparatory work for adjustment in advance, finding out where the problems were, cultivating activists, and then explaining the policies to the cadres, explaining that those who confessed would be treated leniently, otherwise they would be severely punished. Those who were class alien elements, seriously corrupt, and had extremely bad work styles, such as puppet Bao chiefs, were removed and given appropriate punishment; the embezzled items were ordered to be returned in full. Those with generally minor errors were given criticism and education respectively to urge them to correct themselves. In the past six months, according to statistics from five counties including Xuancheng, a total of 225 villages have been rectified. After rectification, the work in the above-mentioned villages has improved, and the political awareness of cadres and the masses has been further enhanced. In particular, the investigation and punishment of landlord and bully elements and the handling of corrupt elements were well received by the masses.

　　In the rectification of grassroots organizations, mass organizations such as farmers' associations in various places have also developed greatly. At the end of last year, the entire special district (which at that time administered the five counties of Xuancheng, Langxi, Jingxian, Guangde, and Ningguo, and later added the two counties of Nanling and Dangtu) had a total of more than 146,800 members of farmers' associations. After rectification, according to statistics from the four counties of Xuancheng, Langxi, Jingxian, and Ningguo, the membership has increased by more than 95,000 people. The membership of women's federations has developed to more than 146,300 people. The number of villages with women's federations accounts for more than 80% of the rural areas in the entire special district. Other organizations such as the Communist Youth League and militia have also developed greatly.

　　The deviations that occurred in the rectification were: (1) Individual counties did not pay enough attention to this work, and even feared that it would affect the progress of the central work, resulting in extremely uneven progress in the work of rectifying grassroots organizations throughout the region. (2) Some leading cadres failed to take specific responsibility and personally grasp the situation; they also lacked specific guidance and assistance to lower-level cadres, resulting in many sloppy work phenomena, which prevented the rectification work from achieving the due effect. (3) The biggest shortcoming was the cadres' taking everything into their own hands. When removing bad elements, they neither considered carefully nor mobilized the masses to discuss, and arbitrarily removed and assigned. Because there was no mass base, the new cadres had many concerns and were not at ease with their work.

　　The work of rectifying grassroots organizations in the special district is still continuing. The leadership has paid attention to the above-mentioned shortcomings in the work. (Zhao Jinzhang, Liu Mengxiang, Zhang Heming)

### 皖南宣城专区整顿农村基层组织  农村干部坏作风已有转变

　　皖南宣城专区整顿农村基层组织
    农村干部坏作风已有转变
    【本报宣城讯】皖南区宣城专区积极整顿和改造农村基层组织（包括政权和农会），为秋后实行土地改革创造条件。该专区解放后，随着各项工作的开展，农村基层组织次第建立起来。但由于当时任务繁重，干部缺少，情况生疏，广大群众对人民政府的各项政策认识不足，因而有不少坏分子乘机混入村政权和农会中，操纵把持，为非做歹，压制群众，政府的政策不能贯彻，政府与人民的关系，也受到很大的影响。
    许多农村基层组织中，由于成份不纯，形成在政治上、思想作风上的各种不良倾向。宣城八区七个村中，有九个伪保长当了干部。广德县刘村，由于坏分子勾结匪徒，今年四月曾发生聚伙抢粮库事件。南陵、当涂、郎溪等县的村政权中有“大刀会”会长、国民党党员、伪军、伪保长、地主分子等。作风极端恶劣，贪污浪费现象相当严重，有些村干部在征粮中私向群众增加摊派数字，吃喝滥用，随便起火吃公饭。强迫命令，脱离群众的现象也非常严重。当涂县在修圩期间，大公圩附近各村，村村都有监房，擅自扣押群众。另外有些干部受了地主恶霸的利诱，直接、间接地成为他们的利益保护者。更有的坏分子奸淫妇女。
    针对以上情况，宣城专署和中共宣城地委于去年指示各县注意整顿村级基层组织。从去年十二月开始至今年六月底止，经半年的努力，各地村政权不纯现象已有改进。并取得不少经验，为今后建政工作及秋后土地改革打下了基础。
    在整顿村政权过程中，各地结合中心工作，根据不同情况，分别采取了部分调整与基本改组的两种办法。其中部分调整者占多数。宣城五区结合修圩工作，整顿了三个村政权，清理了贪污事件，处理了坏干部。整顿办法是：事先做好调整准备工作，找出问题所在，培养积极分子，然后向干部讲明政策，说明坦白者宽大处理，否则严加惩办。对阶级异己分子、贪污严重及作风极端恶劣的伪保甲人员等，予以撤换，并给以适当处分；贪污物品，令其如数退出。对一般错误较小者，则分别给以批评和教育，促其改正。半年来，据宣城等五县的统计，共整顿了二百二十五个村庄。经过整顿，上述村庄的工作已有改进，干部和群众的政治觉悟进一步提高。尤其是撤查了地主恶霸分子，处理了贪污分子，群众反映甚好。
    在整顿基层组织中，各地农会等群众组织也有很大发展。去年年底全专区（当时辖宣城、郎溪、泾县、广德、宁国五县，后又增加南陵、当涂二县）共有农会会员十四万六千八百余人。整顿后，据宣城、郎溪、泾县、宁国四县的统计，已增加会员九万五千余人。妇联会员已发展至十四万六千三百余人。有妇联组织的村庄，约占全专区农村的百分之八十以上。其他如青年团、民兵等组织也有很大发展。
    在整顿中所发生的偏差是：（一）个别县对此项工作还不够重视，甚至害怕因此影响中心工作的进行，致使全区整顿基层组织的工作进展极不平衡。（二）某些领导干部，没能做到具体负责，亲自掌握；对下级干部也缺乏具体指导与帮助，致发生了不少工作草率的现象，使整顿工作未起应有的效果。（三）最大的缺点是干部的包办代替。撤换坏分子时既不慎重考虑，也未发动群众讨论，任意撤查和委派。因为没有群众基础，新干部顾虑很多，工作不安心。
    现该专区整顿基层组织的工作仍在继续进行。对工作中的上述缺点，领导方面已予重视。（赵锦章、刘梦祥、张鹤明）
