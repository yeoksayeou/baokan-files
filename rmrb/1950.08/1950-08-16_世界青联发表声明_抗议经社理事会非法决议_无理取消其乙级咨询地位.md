　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 12th (TASS): The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has issued a statement to the press protesting the illegal resolution passed by the United Nations Economic and Social Council on July 20, revoking the Federation's Category B consultative status. (Note: Under this status, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has the right to send representatives to all public meetings of the Economic and Social Council and submit memoranda.)
    The statement points out: This resolution of the United Nations Economic and Social Council was illegally passed at a session where the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies were not present, and based on a proposal by the United States delegation. The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth firmly protests against this measure, which violates the principles stipulated in the United Nations Charter. This measure only proves once again the desire of the United States government to use the United Nations to implement its imperialist policies. The statement continued: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth has decided to send a letter to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, exposing the illegality of this resolution, and requesting that the issue of granting the World Federation of Democratic Youth Category A consultative status be studied at a session of the Economic and Social Council where the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies are present.
    The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth calls on all its affiliated organizations to support the demand for the cancellation of the above-mentioned illegal resolution of the Economic and Social Council through action.

　　世界青联发表声明
    抗议经社理事会非法决议  无理取消其乙级咨询地位
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社巴黎十二日讯：世界民主青年联盟书记处顷向新闻界发表声明，抗议联合国经社理事会于七月二十日通过的取消该联盟的乙级咨询地位的非法决议。（按：世界民主青联根据此种地位，有权派遣代表出席经社理事会的一切公开会议，并提出备忘录。）
    声明指出：联合国经社理事会的这一决议，是在苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家未出席的情况下，根据美国代表团的提议而非法通过的。世界民主青联书记处坚决抗议这种违反联合国宪章所规定的原则的措施，这种措施只是再度证明了美国政府渴望利用联合国来实行它的帝国主义政策。声明继称：世界民主青联书记处已决定致函联合国秘书长，揭发这一决议的非法性，并且要求在将有苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家出席的经社理事会的会议中，研究准许世界青联列于甲级咨询地位的问题。
    世界民主青联书记处号召所属一切组织，以行动支持取消经社理事会上项非法决议的要求。
