　　Review of One and a Half Years of Northeast Industrial Work
    ——Excerpts from Comrade Wang Heshou's Speech at the Northeast Industrial Work Conference
    [Shenyang News] On August 2nd, Comrade Wang Heshou, Minister of the Northeast Industry Department, delivered a report on the industrial work of the past year and a half at the industrial work conference held by the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    He first summarized that in the past year and a half, Northeast industry has begun to recover and build from the situation of being severely damaged by the war, and has so far had a preliminary good start. He described the changes in the face of Northeast industry from the rapid recovery of factories and mines, the rapid increase in the number of employees, the monthly increase in the quantity of products, the continuous improvement of labor productivity, the reduction of costs, and the great improvement in the lives of workers compared with the past. Then, he recounted that in the past year and a half, under the direct leadership of the Northeast Bureau and the Northeast People's Government, and through the efforts of all cadres and all employees, in order to create conditions for manufacturing more appropriate production plans, in order to implement and implement the economic accounting system, three stages were experienced: from the receiving, clearing, and consolidation period to the further mobilizing the masses to implement the economic accounting system period, to the consolidating the new record movement period with the establishment of the production responsibility system as the pivot. And on the basis of the work in these three stages, a new period focusing on the improvement of business management is now beginning.
    Shortcomings and Errors in Work
    He then focused on reviewing the shortcomings and errors in the work of the past year and a half from four aspects:
    (1) Regarding the situation of planning and plan execution, he pointed out that, according to the situation in 1950, the main problems in the work were: (1) Part of the production plan was out of touch with the needs, so that some products were overstocked, affecting the turnover of funds, and even forced to revise the plan. This is manifested in: when planning production, simply requiring "simplification" without taking into account the variety of specifications needed by other units; formulating plans only from the perspective of equipment capacity, without accurately calculating the required quantity; neglecting quality standards in planning and implementing plans; and the variety and specifications of planned production were too small to meet market needs. (2) When formulating plans and in the implementation of work, some factories and mines did not carefully consider subjective conditions and possibilities, or the plans were not based on a reliable basis, so the plans often failed. (3) The cost plans of many factories and mines were divorced from the advanced quotas that could actually be achieved, so there were many examples of cost reductions of 30% to 50%. Rather than saying that the actual quota was improved through efforts, it was better to say that the planned quota was inaccurate. Because under normal circumstances, if the quota is set relatively correctly and there are no special reasons, such as major technical inventions and improvements, the discovery of favorable resources, the addition of new equipment, etc., it is generally impossible to reduce costs by more than 30%. Therefore, it can be said that the cost plans of some factories and mines were set too high when formulating plans last year, and some even deliberately set the cost plans too high from the perspective of departmentalism, and did not seriously formulate them according to the advanced quotas that could be achieved. Analyzing from the composition ratio of planned cost and actual cost, it can be further explained that the quota has not been well grasped. For example, the actual cost of auxiliary materials for carbon tool steel in Fushun Special Steel Plant was 97.60% lower than the planned cost, the labor quota differed by four times, the repair cost was reduced by 79.5%, and the research cost was reduced by 99.9%. There are many similar examples, which also shows the problems in the plan. For another example, looking at the summary of the production plan in the first half of 1950, 12 of the 34 major products exceeded the plan by more than 20%. Generally speaking, this, like the cost reduction of 30% to 50% for some products, can only be said that the original plan was inaccurate, because a correct plan is difficult to exceed the plan by 20% in the execution without special reasons (such as new inventions and creations, and significant improvement in technical level). He pointed out that the main responsibility for the shortcomings and errors in the plan should be borne by the Ministry of Industry, and hoped that in summarizing the experience and lessons of formulating the plan, the leading cadres of the Ministry of Industry and various bureaus (companies) can improve their thinking and specific work. The specific guiding principle for next year's production plan should be "reducing costs and improving quality," opposing the purely recovery point of view, and paying attention to overcoming conservatism when formulating the planned quota. In addition, it is more important that in the formulation of production plans and in the execution of the plan, special attention must be paid to the quality standards of the plan.
    (2) Regarding capital construction: According to incomplete statistics, among the capital construction projects completed in 1949, new construction accounted for 24.9% of the investment, and restoration accounted for 75.1%. Among them, production equipment accounted for 64.8%, and houses accounted for 35.2%. The capital construction investment in 1950, which has been allocated to various bureaus (companies), accounted for 60.5% of the total new investment for the year.
    The biggest problem in capital construction in 1950 was: there was no overall plan, no consideration was given to the subjective design capabilities, some projects were waiting for design, some projects even started construction without design, and some projects had design errors. When formulating the capital construction plan for 1950, we did not carefully consider our technical conditions, but blindly demanded speed from a subjective desire. Some of them were insufficiently prepared for building materials in advance, and did not stipulate detailed quality standards, and did not implement a strict acceptance system. Therefore, the quality of the project was seriously affected due to the poor quality of red bricks, asbestos tiles, and wood. The resulting loss amounted to 830 billion yuan, which is approximately equal to the annual investment of the Construction Industry Administration this year. Because the surface of capital construction is too large, the subjective technical and management capabilities and experience are not enough, which has resulted in the shortcomings of no one being responsible on the site and the inability to control the quality and progress of the project. He pointed out that the basic reason for these problems is that the idea of economic accounting has not been implemented in the issue of capital construction, and the design, planning, construction, materials, labor efficiency, quality, and cost of each project have not been considered. Therefore, according to this year's lessons, the guiding principle for capital construction in 1951 should be "steady progress, opposing adventurism." And strictly regard capital construction as the same as other industrial production, must calculate costs by project and stipulate quality. Moreover, next year, the engineering company and engineering team will be the production units in capital construction.
    (3) Democratic management issues: He said: The essence of this issue is how to unite all employees and technical personnel, give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all personnel, and do a good job in industrial construction. Based on this understanding, the work of democratic management has serious shortcomings, which are manifested in: (1) Many factories and mines have not learned to regularly and frequently publicize the production plan, work plan, the implementation of each period's plan, the improvement of labor productivity, the reduction of costs, the production profit and loss, and the current key issues to all employees and technical personnel (first to the factory management committee), listen to the opinions of the management committee and the masses, so that the factory and mine plan becomes the plan of all personnel. On the contrary, many factories and mines are accustomed to simple ways of working, or issuing orders, and are not good at stimulating the enthusiasm of all employees and technical personnel. (2) Many factories and mines are not good at using the factory management committee to carry out work, so that the management committee of many factories and mines does not work, which should be the responsibility of the administrative management cadres. (3) The rationalization proposals put forward by employees and technical personnel regarding production methods, opinions on improving safety and health conditions, and improving management cannot be resolved in a timely manner. Some of the things that can be done have not been done, and no explanation has been given for things that cannot be done. (4) Some administrative management cadres are not good at actively soliciting the opinions of the Party committee, trade union, and Communist Youth League on improving production, giving them various working conditions, and actively assisting the Party and trade union in carrying out their work, and even seriously affecting the normal work of the Party committee, trade union, and Communist Youth League.
    (4) In terms of leadership style, he pointed out that the main problems are: (1) Being busy with daily affairs, failing to grasp the key issues that are currently decisive in the enterprise. (2) Failure to carefully study the instructions and decisions on relevant policies, and slow acceptance of other people's experience, so that the work loses its direction, and the work level and policy level cannot be improved. (3) Lack of implementation, inspection, and summarization of experience after the work is arranged. Because a systematic inspection system has not been established, one thing often cannot be "done to the end," and the solution to the problem is both procrastinated and incomplete.
    Key points for improving future work
    Comrade Wang Heshou put forward the main problems existing in工矿[gōng kuàng - industry and mining enterprises] and the key points of future work: First, we must strengthen the operation and management of enterprises, and start by improving the financial and cost system, strengthening technical (quality) management, and gradually implementing the piece-rate wage system to promote the economic accounting of enterprises. In this regard, he further explained the methods of improvement: (1) In order to improve the financial cost system and accelerate the flow of funds, all enterprise leaders are required to pay attention to the financial status of the enterprise, study the turnover rate of funds and the reserve quota of raw materials to accelerate the turnover of funds. At present, there are serious shortcomings in cost management that are not timely and inaccurate, thus reducing the role of cost calculation. In order to change this situation, it is necessary to emphasize the correct "original record" in the current cost calculation, emphasize the "workshop economic accounting system," and strengthen the close connection between the cost calculation organization and various relevant departments, so as to not only control various quotas in the product plan in the future, but also control and audit quotas in the cost plan to promote the more strict implementation of economic accounting. (2) To strengthen technical management to improve product and project quality, it is necessary to systematically and gradually establish a strict technical management system – such as "technical responsibility system" and "quality responsibility system," "quality reward system," "technical personnel authority regulations," "technical operating procedures," various inspection systems, and so on. In order to make improving product quality and project quality one of the goals of constant effort, in addition to mobilizing technical personnel to strengthen technical management, it is also necessary to mobilize all workers, promote advanced experience, and carry out mass-based competition activities. In addition, it is also very necessary to maintain close contact with users. (3) Gradually promoting the piece-rate wage system is an extremely important issue in industrial management under the conditions that production and capital construction have gradually entered a normal state and the quotas have been initially reviewed. Although the current eight-level wage system has a positive effect in promoting the improvement of technology, it has not completely solved the principle of "remuneration according to labor" and "more work, more pay." If the piece-rate wage and excess reward system are not further implemented, not only will the phenomenon of egalitarianism still not be overcome, but it will become an obstacle to increasing production, affecting labor productivity, and the final result is to hinder the promotion of economic accounting. Therefore, it is prepared to gradually promote the piece-rate wage system in a step-by-step manner starting from the fourth quarter, and at the same time implement a reward and punishment system for technical personnel and staff.
    Secondly, carry out capital construction with "steady progress." The speed of capital construction must be limited to within the subjective ability, and any tendency of adventurism will cause huge waste. Therefore, design capabilities, technical conditions and technical level, and subjective organizational management capabilities must be taken into account. In addition, in the specific organization and management of capital construction work, it is necessary to implement the idea and system of economic accounting, strengthen on-site leadership, and establish a responsibility system and supervision system to achieve the goal of improving project quality and reducing costs.
    Thirdly, systematically cultivate reserve forces: According to the Northeast industrial recovery and development plan and the current work situation, it is urgently necessary to replenish a large number of cadres, technical personnel, and skilled workers to the industrial and mining sectors, otherwise there will be great difficulties in a large number of equipment being unattended and unmanaged. Therefore, cultivating reserve forces should become one of the important tasks in the future. In this regard, he listed the training plans of Northeast higher industrial schools (including Northeast Institute of Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Dalian Institute of Technology) and industrial advanced vocational schools (including thirteen advanced vocational schools and one accounting and statistics school). To train skilled workers, it was decided to set up regular technical schools in large quantities in important factories and mines, gradually replacing the method of apprentices led by masters on the spot.
    Fourthly, we must strengthen the unity of all employees. Strengthen the leadership of the Party in the enterprise, further improve the relationship between the Party, the government, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, and strengthen the unity between workers, technical personnel, staff, and leading cadres, so as to better give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of all personnel. To this end, the leading cadres in charge of enterprise management should, with a serious attitude and a spirit of self-criticism, deeply examine and correct the shortcomings and errors in their work, so as to improve the relationship between the Party committee, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. And conscientiously implement the Northeast Bureau's instructions on further uniting technical personnel and staff, conscientiously establish a technical responsibility system, clearly stipulate the responsibilities of technical personnel, and strengthen the education of workers, technical personnel, and staff, so as to achieve closer unity of all employees. Finally, we must, according to possible conditions, conscientiously improve the safety and health conditions of factories and mines, establish various welfare facilities in a step-by-step manner, care for the lives of all personnel, and at the same time strengthen the education of employees to abide by labor discipline and cherish national property, and constantly improve the consciousness of all employees, so that everyone can unite and work together to complete the above important tasks.

　　一年半东北工业工作检查
    ——王鹤寿同志在东北工业工作会议上发言摘要
    【沈阳讯】八月二日，东北工业部部长王鹤寿同志在中共中央东北局召开的工业工作会议上作了关于一年半来工业工作的报告。
    他首先总结一年半来东北工业从接管时被战争严重破坏的情况下，开始恢复建设，迄今已有一个初步良好的开端。他从工厂矿山恢复之迅速，职工人数之迅速增加，产品数量逐月上升，劳动生产率不断提高，成本在降低，以及工人生活较过去大大改善诸方面叙述了东北工业面貌的改观。接着他追述了一年半来工业工作在东北局和东北人民政府直接领导下，经过全体干部和全体职工的努力，为了创造制造比较恰当的生产计划的条件，为了执行和贯彻经济核算制曾经历了三个阶段：从接收、清理、整顿时期到进一步发动群众贯彻经济核算制时期，到以建立生产责任制为枢纽巩固新纪录运动时期。而在这三个阶段的工作基础上，目前正在开始着一个以经营管理的改进为重点的新时期。
    工作中的缺点和错误
    他继而着重从四方面检讨了一年半来工作中的缺点和错误：
    （一）关于计划及计划执行的情形，他指出，根据一九五○年的情况，工作上的主要毛病在于：（１）部分生产计划与需要脱节，因此形成部分产品积压、影响资金的周转，甚至被迫修改计划。表现在：计划产量时，简单要求“单一化”而不照顾其他单位需要的品种规格；制订计划只从设备能力出发，未精确计算需要的数量；计划与执行计划中忽视了质量标准；计划生产的品种和规格太少，不能适应市场需要。（２）制订计划时与执行工作中，有些厂矿没有慎重考虑主观的条件和可能，或是计划没有放在可靠的基础上，因而往往使计划落空。（３）不少厂矿产品的成本计划，脱离了实际上可以达到的先进定额，因而出现了不少成本降低百分之三十至五十的例子，这与其说是经过努力提高了实际定额，则不如说是计划定额不准确。因为在正常的情况下，如果定额定的比较正确而又没有特殊原因，例如技术上大的发明改进，有利资源的发现，新设备的增添等，则降低成本百分之三十以上一般是不可能的。所以可以这样说，部分厂矿去年制定计划时成本计划做高了，甚至有的是由于本位观点故意把成本计划做的过高，而没有认真按照可以达到的先进定额去制订。从计划成本和实际成本的构成比分析，更可说明没有很好掌握定额。如抚顺特殊钢厂炭素工具钢补助材料的实际成本较计划成本降低百分之九七点六○，人工定额相差四倍，修理费降低百分之七九点五，研究费降低百分之九九点九。类此的例子是很多的，这也正说明了计划中的毛病。再如，从一九五○年上半年的生产计划总结看，三十四种主要产品中有十二种主要产品超过计划百分之二十以上。一般地说，这也和有些产品成本降低百分之三十——五十一样，只能说原计划的不准确，因为一个正确计划在执行中如没有特殊的原因（如新的发明创造，技术水平显著提高）超过计划百分之二十是困难的。他指出：计划中的缺点和错误，主要的应由工业部负责，希望在总结制定计划的经验教训中工业部和各局（公司）的领导干部能从思想上和具体工作上提高一步。明年生产计划的具体指导方针应该是“降低成本，提高质量”，反对单纯的恢复观点，并须在制定计划定额时注意克服保守主义。另外，更加重要的是在制定生产计划与在计划执行中，必须特别注意计划质量标准。
    （二）关于基本建设：据不完全统计，一九四九年基本建设竣工工程中，新建占投资的百分之二十四点九，修复占百分之七五点一。其中生产设备占百分之六四点八，房屋占百分之三五点二。一九五○年基本建设投资，已拨给各局（公司）者，占全年新增投资总额的百分之六○点五。
    一九五○年基本建设最大的毛病是：没有通盘计划，没有考虑到主观设计的能力，有些工程等着设计，有些工程甚至不经设计就开工，也有些工程设计发生错误。在制定一九五○年基本建设计划时，没有慎重的考虑我们的技术条件，只从主观愿望出发，盲目地要求迅速。有的是事先对建筑材料准备不够，又未规定详细的质量标准，没有执行严格的验收制度，因此由于红砖、石绵瓦、木材等质量不好，严重地影响了工程质量。因此而产生的损失即达八三○○亿元，约等于今年建筑工业管理局的全年投资。由于基本建设铺的面太大，主观的技术和管理能力以及经验都不够，便产生了现场无人负责，不能控制工程的质量和进度的缺点。他指出产生这些毛病的基本原因是由于在基本建设问题上没有贯彻经济核算思想，没有考虑每件工程的设计、计划、施工、材料、劳动效率、质量、成本等问题。因此，根据今年的教训，一九五一年基本建设的方针应是“稳步前进，反对冒险主义。”并严格的把基本建设视同其他工业生产一样，必须以工程为单位计算成本，规定质量。而且明年将以工程公司工程队为基本建设中的生产单位。
    （三）民主管理问题：他说：这个问题实质上是如何团结全体职工技术人员，发挥全体人员的积极性和创造精神，把工业建设搞好的问题。根据这个认识来检查，民主管理的工作是有严重缺点的，表现在：（１）很多厂矿没有学会定期地经常地把生产计划、工作计划、每个时期计划执行的情形、劳动生产率提高、成本降低、生产盈亏以及目前存在的关键问题向全体职工技术人员公布（首先是向工厂管理委员会公布），听取管委会和群众意见，使厂矿的计划变成全体人员的计划。相反的，很多厂矿习惯于简单的工作方式，或是命令行事，不善于启发全体职工技术人员的积极性。（２）很多厂矿不善于运用工厂管理委员会进行工作，以致不少厂矿的管委会不起作用，这是应该由行政管理干部负责的。（３）不能及时解决职工技术人员提出的关于生产方法的合理化建议，有关改善安全卫生条件及改进管理的意见，有些能做到的没有做，做不到的也未进行解释。（４）有些行政管理干部不善于主动地征求党委、工会、青年团关于改善生产方面的意见，给他们以各种工作的便利条件，积极地协助党和工会进行工作，甚至于严重影响党委、工会与青年团不能正常地进行工作。
    （四）在领导作风上，他指出主要的毛病是：（１）忙于日常事务，抓不住企业中当前具有决定意义的关键问题。（２）对有关政策的指示决定不能缜密研究，对别人的经验接受很慢，以致在工作中迷失方向，工作水平和政策水平不能提高。（３）工作布置后缺乏贯彻检查和总结经验。由于没有建立系统的检查制度，因而一件事往往不能“办到底”，解决问题既拖拉又不彻底。
    改进今后工作的重点
    王鹤寿同志就目前工矿中存在的主要问题和今后工作重点提出：首先要加强企业的经营和管理，并先从健全财务和成本制度，加强技术（质量）管理，逐步实行计件工资制三方面着手改进，以促进企业的经济核算。于此，他进一步说明了改进的方法：（１）为健全财务成本制度，加速资金流转，要求所有企业负责同志，经常注意研究企业的财务状况，研究资金的周转率和原材料的储备定额以加速资金的周转。目前在成本管理上存在着不及时和不准确的严重缺点，因而降低了成本计算的作用。为改变此种情况，目前在成本计算中必须强调正确的“原始记录”，强调“车间经济核算制”，加强成本计算组织和各有关部门的密切联系，以期今后不仅在产品计划中管制各种定额，而且在成本计划中管制、审核定额，以促进经济核算更加严格的执行。（２）加强技术管理以提高产品和工程质量，就要有系统地逐步地建立起严格的技术管理制度——如“技术责任制”和“质量责任制”“质量奖励制”“技术人员职权条例”“技术操作规程”各种检验制度等等。为了把提高产品质量和工程质量作为经常努力的目标之一，除发动技术人员加强技术管理外，还必须发动全体工人，推广先进的经验，开展群众性的竞赛运动。此外，与用户取得密切联系也是十分必要的。（３）逐步推行计件工资制度是在生产与基本建设已逐渐进入正常、定额已经过初步审定的条件下，工业管理中极为重要的问题。现行的八级工资制，虽在推动提高技术上有其积极作用，但并未完全解决“按劳取酬”和“多劳多得”原则，如不进一步实行计件工资和超额奖励制度则不仅平均主义现象仍不能克服，且将成为提高生产的障碍，影响劳动生产率，其最后的结果是障碍经济核算的推行。因此，准备从第四季度开始有步骤地逐步推行计件工资制，同时并实行对技术人员和职员的奖惩制度。
    其次，要“稳步前进”地进行基本建设。基本建设的速度必须限制在主观能力所能及的范围内，任何冒险主义的倾向都会造成巨大的浪费。因此，必须考虑到设计能力、技术条件与技术水平和主观组织管理能力。另外，在基本建设工作的具体组织和管理上，要贯彻经济核算的思想和制度，加强现场领导，建立责任制和监工制度，以达提高工程质量，降低成本的目的。
    其三，要有系统地培养后备力量：根据东北工业恢复和发展计划和目前工作情况，急需补充大批干部、技术人员和技术工人到工矿部门中去，否则将会发生大批设备无人操作管理的巨大困难。因此，培养后备力量便应成为今后重要工作之一。于此，他列举了东北高等工业学校（包括东北工学院、哈尔滨工业大学、大连工学院）和工科高级职业学校（包括十三个高职和一个会计统计学校）的培养计划。对培养技术工人则决定在重要厂矿大量筹办正规的技工学校，逐渐代替现场中师傅带徒弟的方式。
    其四，必须加强全体职工的团结。在企业中加强党的领导，进一步改善党、政、工、青各方面的关系，加强工人、技术人员、职员和领导干部之间的团结，以便更好地发挥全体人员的积极性创造性。为此，企业管理负责干部应以认真严肃的态度，以自我批评精神，深刻检查和纠正工作中的缺点和错误，以搞好党委、行政、工会、青年团关系。并认真贯彻执行东北局对进一步团结技术人员和职员的指示，认真建立技术责任制，明确规定技术人员的职责，加强工人和技术人员职员的教育，以达到全体职工更亲密的团结。最后，必须根据可能的条件，认真改善厂矿的安全卫生状况，有步骤地建立各种福利设施，关心全体人员的生活，同时加强职工遵守劳动纪律和爱护国家财产的教育，不断提高全体职工的觉悟，方能使大家团结一致为完成以上重要工作而共同奋斗。
