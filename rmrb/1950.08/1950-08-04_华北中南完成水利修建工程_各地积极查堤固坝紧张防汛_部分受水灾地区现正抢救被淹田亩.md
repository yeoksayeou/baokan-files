Xinhua News Agency, August 31st: Large-scale spring water conservancy projects in North China have been basically completed, and all provinces are now actively carrying out flood prevention work.

This year's spring water conservancy projects in North China focused on flood control, while also carrying out dredging, canal construction, and other projects according to the different conditions of rivers in various regions. The flood control projects in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces were the largest in scale this year. In Hebei Province, the river defense projects, mainly based on the five major river systems of the Yongding River, Ziya River, South Canal, Ji Canal, and Daqing River, have a total length of more than 1,000 kilometers, with nearly 10 million cubic meters of earthwork. Currently, 8,785,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. This project will ensure that more than 22 million mu of land will no longer be flooded. The Chaobai River project in the eastern part of the province, with 10 million cubic meters of earthwork completed this spring, was also completed at the same time. The flooded area can be reduced by about one-half compared to last year. In Pingyuan Province, the flood control projects for the Yellow River, Qin River, and other general rivers and lakes (including Jinxiangling and South Canal) have completed a total of 13.2 million cubic meters of earthwork and transported more than 157,000 cubic meters of stone, which can save 3.83 million mu of farmland from floods. Shanxi Province completed 18 river straightening projects, and universally built drainage ditches along each river to regulate the water flow, greatly enhancing the safety during the flood season.

The siltation and irrigation projects of the Sanggan River, Yu River, and Guangji River in Chahar Province are larger in scale. The first phase of all the above three canal projects plans to complete more than 4 million cubic meters of earthwork. A total of more than 230 larger structures, such as newly built diversion gates, drainage gates, weirs, sluice gates, and highway bridges, have been built. As of the end of June, more than 94 percent of the earthwork projects have been completed, and 90 percent of the buildings have been completed. After the completion of all projects, it can change the soil quality of 350,000 mu of saline-alkali land along the river. In the Hetao area of the Yellow River in Suiyuan Province, the Fuxing Canal has completed the spring repairs of the gate chambers and has released water on schedule, which can irrigate an area of 400,000 mu. While completing flood control projects, Pingyuan Province also carried out the construction of river and canal water conservancy, which also increased paddy fields by more than 40,000 mu.

Currently, North China is in the flood season, and local governments are mobilizing the masses to rush to repair unconsolidated dikes and dams. Qingyuan and more than 20 other counties in Shanxi Province have universally established flood prevention headquarters, as well as emergency rescue teams and flood reporting stations. Yang Xiufeng, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, personally went to various places on July 15 to inspect the dikes. In order to strengthen flood prevention work, Chahar Province has established flood prevention headquarters at the provincial, prefectural, county, and district levels this summer, extensively mobilizing the masses and actively preparing emergency rescue materials. Due to the limitations of financial and human resources, the spring water conservancy projects in the North China region this year have only carried out some symptomatic treatments of many rivers, ensuring that no breaches occur under a certain flow rate. For example, the Yellow River section in Shanzhou, Pingyuan Province, can only prevent breaches when the flow rate reaches 17,000 cubic meters per second under normal circumstances. If the Yellow River flood flow exceeds 17,000 cubic meters per second this year, bank overflows and breaches may occur. However, in some rivers, such as the Yongding River in Hebei Province, the embankment section in Nanhancun, Anci, collapsed and caused disaster on the 20th of this month due to the slack thinking of flood control personnel, the lack of inspection of dikes, and substandard dike construction.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 31st: Under the leadership of the People's Government, the people of various places in the Central South region completed the annual water conservancy maintenance projects in the entire region by the end of May. The people along the Yangtze and other rivers are now engaged in tense flood prevention. The people in the initial flood-affected areas of the Yangtze River and Pearl River basins are now taking advantage of the gaps between flood peaks to inspect and repair dikes. Some flood-affected areas in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi are rescuing submerged farmland.

Last winter and this spring, people's governments at all levels in the Central South region led the broad masses of farmers in carrying out large-scale blocking, restoration, and reinforcement projects on the 15,000-kilometer-long dike lines along the Yangtze River, Han River, Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, and Pearl River Delta. By the end of May this year, more than 110 million cubic meters were completed, which is 4.5 times more than the annual maintenance during the Kuomintang rule. This can prevent the 12.8 million mu of land that was flooded last year from being affected by floods of the same magnitude as last year.

In order to ensure the completion of the above tasks, the Water Conservancy Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee convened a regional flood prevention conference at the end of May, dividing the Tongma Dike, which intersects with the East China region, and the flood prevention sections between provinces, and establishing flood prevention headquarters at all levels. It also dispatched five inspection teams to Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan provinces to inspect the spring repair projects and flood prevention preparations. Dike sections that did not meet the construction standards have been reprocessed and repaired. Seventy-six flood reporting stations have been established throughout the region, and more than 1,300 kilometers of special flood prevention telephone lines have been erected along the Yangtze and Han main dikes in order to grasp water conditions and strengthen flood prevention leadership. The people in the Yangtze River and riverine areas of each province have organized emergency rescue teams and dike protection teams, and prepared a large number of flood prevention materials.

At present, except for the Yellow River, where the water level has just begun to rise and the people along the coast are making great efforts to protect it, the major river areas in other parts of the Central South region have generally passed the initial flood. The Pearl River basin has passed three flood peaks from early May to the end of June. The Yangtze River basin began to rise in early July and has now fallen back. There were fifty incidents on the Yangtze River main dike and twenty-three incidents on the Han River main dike, all of which were rescued by the joint efforts of the local military and civilians. Only the Daye Baosheng Sluice Gate on the Yangtze River main dike, the Huayan Temple in Hanchuan on the Han River main dike, and a number of tributary dikes and civil dikes breached, flooding about 130,000 mu of farmland. In the upper reaches of the Huai River in Henan Province, and some sections of the Dongjiang River, Lishui River, and Xin River, due to the complacency and satisfaction of some flood prevention cadres, the rough construction of some dikes, and the failure to fill badger holes and ant nests on the dikes in time, some dike sections collapsed, leaked, breached, and overflowed after the floods, causing about 7 million mu of farmland in the entire region to be flooded, with Henan Province alone suffering from 6 million mu of affected land.

At present, the people along the Yangtze River and Pearl River are taking advantage of the gaps between flood peaks to organize processing teams and patrol teams under the leadership of the People's Government to carry out a general inspection of the dikes. The Jingjiang Dike in Hubei Province has undergone two inspections. The disaster-stricken areas in Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces have allocated more than 10 million jin of relief grain and seed loan grain, and the People's Government is leading farmers to block breaches, drain water, and replant late autumn crops.

　　华北中南完成水利修建工程  各地积极查堤固坝紧张防汛
    部分受水灾地区现正抢救被淹田亩
    【新华社三十一日讯】华北地区大规模的水利春修工程业已基本结束，现各省正积极进行防汛工作。
    今年华北地区的水利春修工程系以防洪为重点，同时依据各地河流不同情形，进行疏浚、开渠等工程。河北、平原两省今年的防洪工程规模最大。河北省以永定河、子牙河、南运河、蓟运河、大清河五大河系为主的河防工程，工段长度达一千余公里，土工近一千万公方。现已完成土方八百七十八万五千余公方。此项工程将可保证二千二百余万亩土地不再被淹。该省东部潮白河工程，今春施工土方达一千万公方，亦于同时竣工。淹地面积可较去年减少约二分之一，平原省黄河、沁河及其他一般河、湖（包括金线岭、南运河在内）的防洪工程共完成土方一千三百二十万余公方，运到石料十五万七千余公方，可使三百八十三万亩良田免去水灾。山西完成河身改弯取直工程十八处，各河并普遍修筑了退水渠以调节水势，大大增强了汛期的安全。
    察哈尔省的桑干河、御河、广济三大水渠的淤灌工程规模较大。上述三渠第一期全部工程计划完成土方四百余万公方。新建分水闸、退水闸、跌水、斗门、公路桥等较大建筑物共二百三十余处。截至六月底统计，已完成土方工程百分之九十四以上，建筑物竣工者达百分之九十。全部工程完成后，可使沿河三十五万亩盐碱土地改变土质。绥远省黄河河套的复兴渠已完成春修闸箱工作，并已按期放水，可灌溉面积达四十万亩。平原省于完成防洪工程同时，并进行了兴修河渠水利，亦增加水田达四万余亩。
    目前华北地区正值汛期，各地人民政府正动员群众赶修不巩固的堤坝。山西清源等二十余县普遍组成防汛指挥部及抢险队、报汛站。河北省人民政府杨秀峰主席于七月十五日亲自赴各地检查堤防。察哈尔省为加强防汛工作，今夏省、专区、县、区各级均成立防汛指挥部，广泛发动群众，积极准备抢险材料。今年华北区的水利春修工程，由于财力人力的限制，许多河流仅进行了一些治标的工程，保证在一定流量下不生溃决。如平原省的黄河陕州段只能防止在一般情况下流量达到一万七千秒公方时不生溃决。如今年黄河洪水流量超过一万七千秒公方时，即可能发生漫堤溃决。但部分河流，如河北省永定河，由于防汛人员曾存在麻痹思想，疏于检查堤防，堤工不够标准，本月二十日该河安次南汉村堤段即溃决成灾。
    【新华社汉口三十一日电】中南区各地人民在人民政府领导下，今年五月底即已完成全区的水利岁修工程。沿江、河各地人民现正紧张防汛，长江、珠江流域度过初汛地区的人民，现正利用洪峰间隙进行查堤、补堤。河南、湖北、湖南、江西部分受水灾地区则在抢救被淹田亩。
    中南区各级人民政府去冬今春领导广大农民在长江、汉水、洞庭湖、鄱阳湖、珠江三角洲等全长一万五千余公里的堤线上进行了大规模的堵复和培修工程，至今年五月底止，即完成一亿一千余万公方，超过国民党统治时期每年岁修的四点五倍，可使去年被淹的一千二百八十万亩地，在遭遇与去年同样的洪水量时不致受灾。
    为确保以上任务的完成，中南军政委员会水利部曾在五月底召开全区防汛会议，划分与华东区交错的同马大堤及各省间防汛地段，建立各级防汛指挥部。又派出五个检查组分赴粤、湘、赣、鄂、豫五省检查春修工程和防汛准备工作。不合施工标准的堤段已重行加工补修。全区并设立了七十六个报汛站，沿江、汉干堤已架设一千三百余公里的防汛专用电话线，以便掌握水情，加强防汛领导。各省沿江、河地区人民已分别组织了抢险队和护堤队，并准备好大批防汛器材。
    目前中南区除黄河水位刚开始上涨，沿岸人民正大力进行防护外，其它各主要河流地区均已大体度过初汛。珠江流域五月初至六月底已度过三次洪峰。长江流域七月初开始涨水，现已回落。长江干堤曾出险五十处，汉水干堤出险二十三处，均经当地军民协力抢修后脱险。仅长江干堤上的大冶保生闸、汉水干堤上的汉川华严寺及一部支堤、民堤溃口，淹田约十三万亩。河南省淮河上游，及东江澧水、信江等部分堤段均由于部分防汛干部麻痹自满，部分堤防施工粗糙，堤上獾洞蚁穴未及时填补，致有部分堤段遭洪水后即发生倒塌、漏水、溃口和漫溢现象，使全区约有七百万亩田地被淹，仅河南省受灾地即达六百万亩。
    现长江、珠江沿河各地人民正利用洪峰间隙，在人民政府领导下组织加工队，巡视队，进行了普遍查堤。湖北省荆江大堤已进行过两次检查。河南、湖北、湖南三省遭受水灾地区已拨发救济粮和贷种粮一千余万斤，人民政府正领导农民进行堵复决口、排水、补种晚秋等工作。
