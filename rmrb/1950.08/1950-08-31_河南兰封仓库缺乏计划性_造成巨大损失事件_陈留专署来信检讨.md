　　Lack of Planning at Lanfeng Warehouse in Henan Causes Huge Losses

　　Chenliu Prefecture Sends Letter of Self-Criticism

To the Editors:

　　On August 13th, the People's Forum published a criticism of the Lanfeng Warehouse in the Chenliu Special District of Henan Province, regarding the lack of planning in the public grain storage work, which caused huge losses. We immediately sent people to investigate. We are now informing you of the investigation results and corrective measures:

　　The reasons for this incident are mainly due to the bureaucratic work style of the special district leadership. The specific manifestations are:

　　(1) Insufficient estimation of the situation beforehand, and inadequate preparation. The warehouse had only eleven original cadres (two of whom were sick), plus eight working comrades from the Grain Bureau and other personnel, totaling only twenty-four people. However, when arranging for storage, it was determined that the warehouse would receive 800,000 catties of public grain per day (this figure was arranged by the Grain Bureau of the special district, without the approval of the main responsible person). Therefore, there was a considerable gap between the receiving figure and the organization of manpower. This is the result of not proceeding from the actual situation and making plans based on subjective fantasy.

　　(2) We had already discovered that the warehouse cadres had shortcomings in unity. For example, the general cadres had many opinions about the warehouse director, Liu Cunxiu, which affected the work. However, the special district failed to investigate in time. This shows that the special district leadership did not pay enough attention to this large-scale public grain storage work.

　　(3) When arranging for the summer grain collection this year, it was proposed that the public grain in each county should be dried and winnowed; it was repeatedly pointed out in the instructions and notices that the public grain should meet the storage standards. However, there were only instructions and notices, and the leadership failed to conduct timely and in-depth inspections and understanding, and provide timely guidance. The special district did not know the quality and dryness of the public grain in each county, and the counties and districts were also unclear about this issue. The leadership work became empty talk. This is a series of serious bureaucratic manifestations from the district to the county and from the county to the special district.

　　(4) County and district cadres did not check the quality of the public grain. The mobilization and education work for the masses before the event was not done well enough, and there were no main cadres responsible for leading and controlling the transportation. The warehouse itself did not contact the counties and districts that were delivering grain to make thorough plans. Therefore, when a large amount of public grain was transported, they were at a loss. When receiving the grain, they could not patiently persuade the masses, but instead adopted an attitude of checking for the sake of checking, and simply handled things. This is a serious manifestation of bureaucracy and commandism, and also a major cause of the incident.

　　In summary, we have serious bureaucracy in our grain collection work, which shows that we lack a mass viewpoint and adopt an irresponsible attitude towards state property, resulting in undue huge losses to the people and state property. To this end, the special district has taken the following measures:

　　(1) Reorganize the warehouse organization. The responsible cadres of the warehouse and the responsible cadres of the grain-delivering counties will jointly form a storage committee. Under this, there will be inspection, internal command, external command, registration, reception, and weighing groups, totaling thirty-three people. Specific division of labor, clear responsibilities, to ensure that public grain is received as it arrives and stored in an orderly manner.

　　(2) We have notified all counties to carry out grain drying and inspection campaigns. Cadres from the Grain Bureau have gone separately to Qi County and Kaocheng County, and gone deep into districts and villages to check the quality of the grain. The deputy director of the bureau, Qu Ziwan (newly appointed), personally went to the warehouse to take control. Commissioner Yang Hongyou of the special district also personally went to Dawangmiao, Menglizhai, and Tianchengzhai townships in Qi County to conduct in-depth inspections and understand the situation. Deputy County Magistrate Jiang Tao of Qi County also went to Lanfeng to organize grain delivery. Cadres of the Lanfeng Warehouse also held a meeting to conduct self-criticism, launch criticism and self-criticism. The director of the warehouse, Liu Cunxiu, has been removed from his post and transferred to the special district for reflection. Qi County and Kaocheng County have also made self-criticisms on this matter, and given the derelict cadres the punishment they deserve.

　　(3) Concrete arrangements have also been made in the county: hold cadre meetings to open up thinking, conduct self-criticism, clarify responsibilities, and oppose the erroneous idea of only criticizing others and not criticizing oneself. And through various meetings, such as farmers' representative meetings, representatives of all walks of life meetings, and village meetings, openly review the shortcomings of the government and the warehouse. Leaders boldly admit the wrong things; those that need to be explained are persuaded and explained to enlighten the masses, expose the sabotage behavior of a few bad elements, so as to quell the dissatisfaction of the masses. At the same time, use concrete facts to educate the masses and call on them to universally carry out the turning and drying of grain to protect state property. Those who actively protect the warehouse should be commended at the meeting; those who are bad elements should be exposed and isolated among the masses, and arrested after obtaining conclusive evidence.

### 河南兰封仓库缺乏计划性  造成巨大损失事件  陈留专署来信检讨

　　河南兰封仓库缺乏计划性
    造成巨大损失事件
    陈留专署来信检讨编辑同志：
    八月十三日，人民园地刊登了对河南省陈留专区兰封仓库公粮入仓工作因缺乏计划性，造成巨大损失的批评。我们当即派人进行了检查。现将检查结果和纠正办法告诉你们：
    此次事件发生的原因，主要由于专署领导上存在有官僚主义的工作作风。其具体表现是：
    （一）在事前对情况估计不足，准备工作也做得不够。仓库原有干部十一人（内有二个生病的），加上粮食分局的工作同志八人以及其他人员，总计不过二十四人。但在布置入仓时，却确定该仓每天接收八十万斤公粮（这数字是专署粮食分局布置的，未经主要负责人批准）。因而接收数字与力量的组织上有相当的距离。这就是不从实际情况出发，以主观空想来作计划所造成的结果。
    （二）我们早已发现仓库的工作干部，在团结上有缺点。例如一般干部对仓库主任刘存秀很有意见，使工作受到了影响。但专署未能及时调查。这说明专署领导上对此次大规模的公粮入仓工作重视不够。
    （三）今年布置夏征时，就提出各县公粮要晒干扬净；在指示中、通知中也一再指出，公粮要符合入仓标准。但光有指示、通知，而领导上未及时深入检查了解，及时予以指导。究竟各县公粮成色好坏、干潮如何？不仅专署不得而知，而县区对此问题也摸不清底。领导工作成为纸上谈兵。这是从区到县、从县到专署，一连串的严重官僚主义的表现。
    （四）县区干部对公粮成色不作检查。事前对群众的动员、教育工作做得很不够，并在运送中又无主要干部负责领导掌握。仓库本身也没有和交粮的县区联系，作周密的计划，因此，当大批公粮运来时，即束手无策。收粮时又不能耐心的去说服群众，相反地却采取为检查而检查的态度，简单从事。这是严重的官僚主义与命令主义的表现，也是促成该事件的主要原因。
    综上所述，我们在收粮工作中存在严重官僚主义，表现了我们缺乏群众观点，对国家财产采取不负责的态度，以致使人民与国家财产遭受了不应有的巨大损失。为此，专署已采取了如下几种措施：
    （一）重新调整仓库组织。由仓库负责干部与送粮县的负责干部共同组成入仓委员会。下设：检查、对内指挥、对外指挥、登记、招待、过磅等组，共计三十三人。具体分工，明确责任，保证公粮随到随收，有秩序的入仓。
    （二）我们已通知各县进行晒粮查粮运动。粮食分局干部已分头到杞县、考城两县，深入到区、村检查粮食质量。该局副局长曲子万（刚到职）亲自到仓库去掌握。专署杨鸿猷专员亦亲自到杞县大王庙、孟李砦、田程砦等三乡，深入检查了解情况。杞县副县长江涛亦到兰封组织交粮。兰封仓库干部并开会进行了检讨，展开批评与自我批评。该仓库主任刘存秀已给予撤职处分，并调专署反省。杞县、考城两县对此事亦作了检讨，对失职干部分别给了应得的处分。
    （三）在县里也作了具体的布置：开干部会打通思想，进行检讨，明确责任，反对光检讨别人不检讨自己的错误思想。并通过各种会议如农代会、各界代表会、村民大会等公开检讨政府与仓库的缺点。错误的地方，领导上大胆的承认；需解释的则加以说服解释，启发群众觉悟，揭露少数坏分子的破坏行为，以便平息群众的不满情绪。同时用具体事实教育群众，号召他们普遍进行翻晒粮食，以爱护国家的财产。对积极护仓的群众，则应在大会上予以表扬；对坏分子，则设法使其在群众中暴露孤立起来，待获得确凿材料以后予以逮捕。
