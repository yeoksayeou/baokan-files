The Central Fuel Industry Ministry Determines Focus of Rectification
	Unite Technical Personnel, Improve Party-Masses Relations
	[Report from this newspaper] The Party member cadres above the section chief level of the Central Fuel Industry Ministry and its affiliated professional administrations began studying rectification documents on August 17. They will use criticism and self-criticism to examine the work of leadership and key cadres, and broadly solicit opinions from non-Party cadres and the masses.
	Technical personnel (including accounting and statistics personnel) account for more than two-thirds of all cadres in the ministry. In the past, insufficient work has been done to unite and educate these cadres, so that their role has not been fully utilized in their work, which has hindered the unity between Party and non-Party technical personnel. Therefore, the ministry has decided to make uniting technical personnel and improving Party-masses relations the primary issue in this rectification. Secondly, through rectification, it will examine the lack of a holistic view in handling public and private affairs in the past, as well as the waste in construction projects and organizational expenditures, so as to improve the ideological and policy level of Party member cadres, give play to the initiative and creativity of technical personnel, and improve the work efficiency of Party and non-Party cadres, so as to complete the arduous production and construction tasks. At the same time, through the rectification movement, we will establish and implement a streamlined, economical, and meticulously calculated leadership style in the ideology of cadres, so that the main leading cadres will face business and study technology.

　　中央燃料工业部确定整风重点
    团结技术人员改善党群关系
    【本报讯】中央燃料工业部及所属各专业管理局科长以上的党员干部，已于八月十七日开始学习整风文件，将以批评与自我批评的方法，检查领导和主要干部的工作，并广泛吸收非党干部群众的意见。
    该部全体干部中，技术人员（包括会计、统计等人员）共占三分之二以上。过去对这些干部的团结和教育工作做得不够，以致在工作上未能充分发挥他们的作用，妨碍了党与非党技术人员的团结。因此该部决定将团结技术人员，改善党群关系作为此次整风中的首要问题。其次，将通过整风检查过去在处理公私关系上缺乏全局观点，及修建工程与机关开支方面的浪费现象，以提高党员干部的思想水平与政策水平，发挥技术人员的积极性创造性，提高党与非党干部的工作效率，以完成繁重的生产建设任务。同时将通过整风运动，在干部思想上树立和贯彻精简节约，精打细算的领导作风，使主要领导干部面向业务钻研技术。（中央人民政府燃料工业部通讯组）
