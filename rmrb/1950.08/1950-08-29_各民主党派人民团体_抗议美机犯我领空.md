　　Democratic Parties and People's Organizations
    Protest U.S. Aircraft Intrusion into Our Airspace
    Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang Issues Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued the following statement regarding the intrusion of U.S. aircraft into our Northeast airspace, indiscriminate strafing, endangering the lives and property of our people, and in support of the serious protest lodged by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of our Central People's Government to the United States on this matter, as well as the request to the United Nations Security Council for effective measures:
    On August 27th, the U.S. troops invading Korea dispatched aircraft five times in a single day, intruding into our Northeast airspace and strafing our buildings, stations, vehicles, and people along the right bank of the Yalu River, causing serious casualties.
    The Chinese people have repeatedly expressed strong protests against the bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea by the U.S. aggressor's aircraft, resulting in significant casualties and damage to the lives and property of the Korean people. The U.S. authorities have not only failed to stop the atrocities of their invading troops but have instead expanded these atrocities to the Chinese people. Facts have proven that the U.S. invading authorities have turned a deaf ear to all verbal protests made by the Chinese people. The intention of the U.S. authorities to expand the situation, disregard humanity, and undermine world peace has been fully exposed to the people of the world. The U.S. authorities should bear full responsibility for the current serious stage of development. We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's request in the protest to immediately punish the provocative and brutal actions of the U.S. Air Force and to be responsible for compensating all losses suffered by the Chinese side.
    Because the U.S. troops are invading Korea, the United Nations Security Council has already undergone a severe test. Because the U.S. invading troops have expanded their atrocities, causing significant damage to the Chinese people, the United Nations Security Council should even more consider where the security of various regions of the world lies. If the Security Council believes that this is its unavoidable responsibility, as suggested by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, it should "sanction this provocative and brutal act of the U.S. troops invading Korea intruding into Chinese airspace and should immediately take measures to ensure that the U.S. government completely withdraws its troops in Korea, so as to avoid further expansion of the situation and facilitate the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue by the United Nations."
    Now, the people of all of China, the people of all of Asia, and the people of the world are watching how the U.S. government and the United Nations Security Council will respond to the reasonable demands and suggestions of our Central People's Government.

    Democratic League Issues Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] The China Democratic League issued a statement regarding the crime of U.S. imperialist aircraft intruding into our Northeast airspace. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    On August 27th, thirteen U.S. military aircraft in five batches intruded into the airspace of our People's Republic of China, strafing our buildings, stations, and vehicles along the right bank of the Yalu River and massacring our Chinese people. This illegal act of aggression by the U.S. is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The U.S. imperialists caused 21 Chinese compatriots to be injured and 3 killed.

    Since U.S. President Truman ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to interfere with our liberation of Taiwan on June 27th, followed by MacArthur leading senior naval and air force officials to Taiwan, and then the U.S. 13th Air Force actually moving to Taiwan, this series of facts is ironclad proof of U.S. armed interference in China's internal affairs and infringement upon China's sovereignty. Our Foreign Minister lodged a solemn protest with the United Nations on August 24th against this illegal act of aggression by the U.S. On August 25th, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin made such a shameless denial of our Foreign Minister Zhou's accusation: "The United States has not violated Chinese territory, and the United States has not taken aggressive actions against China." But within 48 hours, U.S. military aircraft intruded into our Northeast airspace, destroying our property and massacring our people. Can this barbaric act of aggression of unprovoked provocation by the U.S. be concealed and deceived by empty lies?

    On August 27th, our Foreign Minister Zhou made a serious protest to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson regarding the illegal and violent acts of the U.S., demanding punishment and compensation, and also telegraphed the United Nations Security Council to immediately stop this provocative violence by the U.S. The China Democratic League firmly supports this solemn protest and just demand of our Foreign Minister Zhou.
    Today, we would like to warn U.S. imperialism even more that this aggressive move by the U.S. is a crime that provokes the 475 million people of China. We, the Chinese people, are determined to fight to the end to uphold national sovereignty and defend world peace. We believe that the Chinese people will definitely give strong resistance and severe punishment to adventurous aggressors!

    CNDCA Issues Written Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] A spokesperson for the China National Democratic Construction Association issued the following written statement protesting the U.S. aircraft intrusion into our airspace and strafing of Chinese people:
    Two months after the U.S. imperialists armed invasion of our Taiwan, they again invaded our Northeast airspace with aircraft, reaching five times in one day, and continuously strafed our people, buildings and vehicles as many as four times. This shameless and crazy act of aggression further exposed the hideous face of U.S. imperialism and added another blood debt to the 475 million people of China!
    As is well known, after the U.S. imperialists retreated from the Chinese mainland, they actively supported the reactionaries of all Asian countries to massacre the Asian people, especially directly launching the Korean civil war and invading our territory of Taiwan with the navy, tearing up the UN Charter, the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Agreement. Today, when the Korean issue has not yet been resolved peacefully, they are provoking our Northeast, attempting to expand the incident and plunge peaceful Asia into a state of war terror.
    However, the Chinese people will never be intimidated by this rampant act of aggression by the U.S. The Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has made a serious protest to the U.S. on behalf of our Central People's Government and requested the Security Council to take immediate measures to ensure that the U.S. completely withdraw its invading troops in Korea. In addition to unanimously and firmly supporting the protests and demands made by Foreign Minister Zhou, all members of our Democratic National Construction Association call on the people of the whole country: only by redoubling our efforts in the world peace movement can we contain the imperialist threat and destruction of peace; only by strengthening and expanding the world peace and democracy camp can we prevent the imperialists from using their tricks. We also ask the national industrialists and businessmen of the whole country to fully develop their enthusiasm for loving the motherland and the people, develop production, prosper the economy, and strive to build a new country's economy under the leadership of the working class and the Chinese Communist Party, and strive to liberate Taiwan and smash the U.S. imperialist's aggressive behavior!

    Guo Moruo Issues Statement
    [This newspaper] Non-Party Democrat Guo Moruo issued the following statement protesting the intrusion of U.S. military aircraft into our airspace:
    Due to Truman's statement of June 27 and subsequent actions, the U.S. imperialists openly carried out armed aggression against Korea and our Taiwan, which is already unscrupulous, barbaric and shameless. After suffering a disastrous defeat in Korea and indiscriminate bombing, the U.S. invading beast troops attacked our country's airspace on the right bank of the Yalu River on August 27 and strafed our people, causing casualties. It is even more unscrupulous, barbaric and shameless.
    I personally went to Korea to observe and came back. The American aggressors are indeed a group of the most inhuman beasts. The bestial acts of U.S. imperialism today actually surpass those of Japanese imperialism and Nazi Germany. Anyone with a little sense of justice cannot tolerate the bestial acts of the U.S. emperor.
    Foreign Minister Zhou has made a serious protest to U.S. Acheson, requesting the U.S. government to be responsible for punishing and compensating for the intrusion into our Northeast airspace, and to telegraph the UN Security Council, requesting immediate stop to the U.S. imperialists' atrocities, and to make the U.S. emperor completely withdraw its troops invading Korea. This is exactly what represents the just call of the Chinese people.

    Withdrawing the aggressive beast troops from Korea and Taiwan is the most fundamental way to prevent the expansion of the situation, that is, the so-called plan to eradicate the root cause. If the U.S. imperialists are unwilling to do it, all peace-loving people in the world must make it happen.
    All Chinese, all Asians, all over the world, all kind people unite and strive for the just struggle to stop the bestial behavior of the U.S. emperor!

    China Association for Promoting Democracy Issues Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] The China Association for Promoting Democracy recently issued a statement protesting the crime of U.S. aircraft intruding into our airspace. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    The U.S. Air Force dared to intrude into the airspace of our People's Republic of China, strafing, killing our compatriots, and destroying our locomotives. This intentional provocative act of the U.S. Air Force proves that the U.S. aggressors are continuing to expand their armed aggression in Korea and our territory of Taiwan. This has made the Chinese people further recognize the hideous faces of the U.S. aggressors. We Chinese people must not allow the U.S. aggressors to invade any corner of our territory, territorial waters, or airspace. We firmly support the serious protest lodged by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the U.S. government. The U.S. government must immediately severely punish the U.S. Air Force that wreaked havoc in Chinese airspace on August 27. Be responsible for compensating all losses suffered by the Chinese side, and immediately withdraw all naval and air forces from the Chinese territory of Taiwan. We firmly support the accusations and suggestions made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the United Nations Security Council. We believe that it is the unshirkable responsibility of the United Nations Security Council to immediately sanction the U.S. government's crime of armed aggression against Chinese territory and to immediately take measures to ensure that the United States completely withdraws its aggressive troops in Korea, in order to guarantee Asian and world peace and security.

    Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Issues Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party issued the following statement regarding the brutal act of the U.S. emperor invading our airspace and injuring our compatriots:
    On August 25, U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin was still quibbling about the accusations made by our Foreign Minister Zhou, saying, "The United States has not violated Chinese territory, nor has the United States taken aggressive actions against China." However, in less than two days, U.S. military aircraft strafed our stations, vehicles, buildings and people along the right bank of the Yalu River in the airspace of our Northeast territory. There were 13 aircraft carrying out five reconnaissance and strafing missions, injuring 21 of our compatriots and killing 3. This crime is a powerful counterattack to Austin's shameless lies, and it is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people.

    This act of aggression and provocation by the U.S. emperor is not accidental. It is another act of armed aggression against China following the U.S. emperor's Seventh Fleet invading our Taiwan Strait and the 13th Air Force and other military personnel invading our Taiwan territory; it is also the U.S. emperor's Korean war of aggression, which suffered a disastrous defeat under the heroic resistance of the Korean people, and therefore, became a more brutal manifestation.
    We would like to tell the American aggressors that the Chinese people are no longer at the mercy of the imperialists to be invaded and massacred at will. The 475 million Chinese people are united under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and are determined to fight to the end to defend the motherland and world peace! Our Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson and his request to the UN Security Council on August 27 is a unanimous demand of the Chinese people. The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party firmly supports Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest and just demands.

    September 3rd Society Issues Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] The September 3rd Society issued a statement protesting the crazy crime of U.S. aircraft intruding into our airspace and shooting and killing our people. The statement is as follows:
    At the same time as the U.S. imperialists began their aggression against Korea, war peddler Truman issued a statement, dispatching his 7th Fleet stationed in the Pacific to armed intervention our liberation of Taiwan. Our Foreign Minister Zhou telegraphed the UN Security Council, ordering all U.S. armed forces to withdraw. Just as U.S. Department of Defense officials were issuing statements, trying to conceal their crimes of invading Taiwan, U.S. aircraft invading Korea again continuously invaded our Northeast airspace over the Yalu River on August 27, strafing our buildings, stations, vehicles, and injuring and killing many of our compatriots. This serious crime of the United States of infringing on China's sovereignty, killing the Chinese people, and attempting to expand the war and undermine world peace is unforgivable to the Chinese people. In addition to absolutely supporting our Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to U.S. Secretary of State Acheson on August 27 regarding the request to punish the U.S. Air Force that invaded our airspace, compensate for all losses, and bear all responsibilities and consequences, we also hope that the United Nations Security Council will immediately and severely sanction the U.S. aggression against Korea and the provocations and atrocities committed in Chinese territory.

    Central Committee of the Communist Youth League Issues Statement
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a statement protesting the American aircraft's intrusion into our country's airspace and strafing of our people:
    We Chinese youth and members of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League strongly protest the provocative and brutal act of American aircraft intruding into our country's airspace and strafing our people. We firmly support the demands raised in Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations Security Council and the protest to the U.S. government, and are fully prepared to fight under the leadership of our Central People's Government to crush the aggression of U.S. imperialism.
    Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League August 28th

    All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Four Other People's Organizations Jointly Protest U.S. Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 28th] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association jointly protested the criminal act of aggression by U.S. aircraft intruding into our airspace and strafing our people. The full text of the protest is as follows:
    Military aircraft of the U.S. troops invading Korea repeatedly intruded into our country's airspace on August 27 and strafed our buildings, stations, and vehicles in Linjiang, Andong, and other places, killing three of our compatriots and injuring twenty-one. This incident once again proves that the U.S. Truman government's policy of aggression against our country is being carried out madly. This shameless and brutal provocative act of U.S. imperialism has aroused unparalleled indignation among the people of the whole country. We, on behalf of the people and the working class of the whole country, firmly support and support Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the U.S. government and the accusations and suggestions to the United Nations Security Council, and demand that the U.S. government immediately punish the U.S. Air Force's provocative and brutal crimes this time, and be responsible for compensating all losses suffered by the Chinese side; demand that the United Nations Security Council sanction this provocative and brutal act of the U.S. troops invading Korea intruding into Chinese airspace, and should immediately take measures to ensure that the U.S. government completely withdraws its aggressive troops in Korea, so as to avoid further expansion of the situation and maintain peace and security in Asia and the world.

    抗议美机犯我领空
    民革主席发表声明
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国国民党革命委员会李济深主席为美国飞机侵入我东北领空，滥施扫射，危害我人民生命财产，并拥护我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长为此事向美国所提的严重抗议以及向联合国安全理事会要求采取有效的措施一事，特发表声明如下：
    美国侵略朝鲜的军队，于本月二十七日一日之内出动飞机五次，侵入我东北领空，沿鸭绿江右岸扫射我建筑物、车站、车辆及人民以致伤亡，情形极为严重。
    中国人民对于美国侵略者的飞机在朝鲜和平的城市与乡村，滥施轰炸，造成朝鲜人民生命财产重大的伤亡与损害，已一再表示强烈的抗议。美国当局，对于他们侵略军队的暴行，不但不加以制止，反而将这种暴行扩大到中国人民的头上来。事实证明，美国侵略当局对于中国人民所作的一切口头抗议，都置若罔闻，美国当局之有意扩大事态，蔑视人道，破坏世界和平，已完全暴露在世界人民的面前。事情发展到目前这样严重的阶段，美国当局应负完全责任。我们坚决拥护周外长在抗议书中的要求，立即惩办美国空军这种挑衅和残暴行为，并负责赔偿中国方面所受的一切损失。
    因为美国的军队侵略朝鲜，使联合国安全理事会已经遭受到严重的考验，因为美国侵略军队扩大其暴行，使中国人民蒙受了重大的损害，联合国安全理事会更应当考虑到世界各个区域的安全究竟何所寄托。安全理事会如果认为这是他本身义不容辞的责任，诚如我外交部周恩来部长所建议，便应当“来制裁美国侵略朝鲜军队的这种侵入中国领空的挑衅和残暴行为，并应立即采取措施，使美国政府完全撤退其在朝鲜的军队，以免事态扩大，并有利于联合国和平调处朝鲜问题。”
    现在，全中国的人民，全亚洲的人民，全世界的人民，都在注视美国政府和联合国安全理事会对于我中央人民政府合理的要求与建议将如何反应。
    民主同盟发表谈话
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国民主同盟为美帝国主义飞机侵入我东北领空罪行发表谈话。谈话全文如下：
    八月二十七日美国军用飞机十三架分五批侵入我中华人民共和国领土上空，沿鸭绿江右岸扫射我建筑物、车站、车辆，并屠杀我中国人民。美帝这种违法侵略行为，竟使我中国同胞受伤者二十一人，死者三人。美帝这种野蛮残暴的行为，是我们中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    自从美国总统杜鲁门六月二十七日下令美国第七舰队干涉我解放台湾后，继之以麦克阿瑟率领海空军高级官吏到台湾。其后美帝第十三航空队又居然移驻我台湾。这一连串的事实，是美帝武装干涉中国内政侵犯中国主权的铁证。对美帝这种违法侵略行为，我国外长已于八月二十四日向联合国提出严正的控诉。八月二十五日美驻联合国代表奥斯汀对我周外长的控诉，居然作出这样无耻的狡赖：“美国并未侵犯中国领土，美国也未对中国采取侵略行动。”但时间不出四十八小时，美国军用飞机竟又侵入我东北领空，破坏我国财产，屠杀我国人民。美帝这种无端挑衅的野蛮侵略行为，难道又是空口谎言所可掩饰欺骗的吗？
    八月二十七日我周外长对美帝违法暴行，已向美国务卿艾奇逊提出严重抗议，要求惩凶赔偿，同时并致电联合国安理会请立即制止美帝这种挑衅暴行。中国民主同盟坚决拥护我周外长这种严正的抗议和正义的要求。
    我们今天更愿警告美帝国主义，美帝这种侵略举动，是向我中国四万万七千五百万人民挑衅的罪行。我们中国人民对拥护国家主权和保卫世界和平，是有奋斗到底的决心的。我们相信我中国人民对冒险侵略者必定予以坚强的抵抗与严重的惩罚！
    民建发表书面谈话
    【新华社二十八日讯】民主建国会发言人为抗议美机侵犯我领空扫射中国人民的暴行，发表书面谈话如次：
    美帝国主义者继其武装侵略我台湾之后两个月，又以飞机侵犯我东北领空，一日之间竟达五次，并连续扫射我国人民及建筑物车辆达四次之多，这种无耻的疯狂的侵略暴行，愈益暴露了美帝的狰狞面目，增添了中国四万万七千五百万人民的一笔血债！
    如所周知，美帝从中国大陆上败退以后，积极扶持所有亚洲国家的反动派残杀亚洲人民，尤其是直接发动朝鲜内战和用海军侵犯我国领土台湾，已经把联合国宪章和开罗宣言以及波茨坦协定一手撕毁。而当朝鲜问题尚未和平解决的今天，竟又向我东北挑衅，企图扩大事端，把和平的亚洲陷于战争恐怖的状态。
    但是，中国人民决不为美帝这种猖狂的侵略暴行所吓倒。周恩来外长已代表我中央人民政府向美帝提出严重的抗议，并要求安理会立即采取措施，使美帝完全撤退其在朝鲜的侵略军队。我们民建会全体会员除对周外长所提出的抗议和要求一致坚决的表示拥护之外，并且号召全国人民：只有加倍对世界和平运动的努力，才能遏制住帝国主义对和平的威胁和破坏；只有世界和平民主阵容的坚强壮大，才能叫帝国主义者无所施其技俩。我们还要求全国的民族工商业者，充分发挥爱祖国爱人民的热情，在工人阶级和中国共产党领导之下，发展生产，繁荣经济，努力从事于新国家的经济建设，为解放台湾粉碎美帝的侵略行为而奋斗！
    郭沫若发表谈话
    【本报讯】无党无派民主人士郭沫若为抗议美军飞机侵入我国领空发表谈话如下：
    美帝国主义者由于六月二十七日杜鲁门的声明及其后的行动，对于朝鲜和我们的台湾，实行公开武装侵略，已经是肆无忌惮、蛮横无耻；美国侵略兽军在朝鲜遭受惨败、滥施轰炸之余，八月二十七日兽军飞机竟分批侵袭鸭绿江右岸我国领空并对我国人民扫射，致有伤亡，更属是肆无忌惮、蛮横无耻。
    我曾经亲自到朝鲜去观察了回来，美国侵略者的确是一群最无人性的野兽；美帝国主义在今天的兽行实际上超过了日本帝国主义和纳粹德国，凡是稍有正义感的人对于美帝兽行实在是不能容忍。
    周外长已对美国艾奇逊提出了严重抗议，要求美国政府对侵入我东北领空一事，负责惩凶赔偿；并电联合国安理会，要求立即制止美帝暴行，并使美帝完全撤退侵略朝鲜的军队。这正是代表了全中国人民的正义的呼声。
    从朝鲜和台湾撤退侵略兽军是防止事态扩大的最根本的办法，即所谓拔本塞源之计。美帝国主义者如不肯做到，全世界爱好正义的人民必须使它做到。
    全中国、全亚细亚、全世界、一切善良的人民团结起来，为制止美帝兽行的正义斗争而奋斗！
    民主促进会发表声明
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国民主促进会顷发表声明抗议美国飞机侵入我国领空的罪行。声明全文如下：
    美国空军竟敢侵入我中华人民共和国的领土上空，实行扫射，残杀我同胞，击毁我机车，美国空军这种有意的挑衅行为，证明美国侵略者正在继续扩大在朝鲜和我国领土台湾的武装侵略。使中国人民更进一步地认识了美国侵略者的狰狞面目。我们中国人民决不能允许美国侵略者来侵犯我国领土领海领空的任何一个角落。我们坚决拥护周恩来外长向美国政府提出的严重抗议。美国政府必须立即严厉惩办八月二十七日在中国领空肆虐的美国空军。负责赔偿中国方面所受的一切损失，并且立即将在中国领土台湾方面的海空军完全撤出去。我们坚决支持周恩来外长向联合国安理会提出的控诉与建议。我们认为立即制裁美国政府武装侵略中国领土的罪行，并且立即采取措施，使美国完全撤退其朝鲜的侵略军队，以保证亚洲和世界和平与安全，是联合国安理会义不容辞的责任。
    农工民主党发表谈话
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国农工民主党为美帝侵入我领空伤害我同胞的暴行发表谈话如下：
    八月二十五日美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀对我周外长的控诉，还在狡赖说：“美国并未侵犯中国领土，美国也未对中国采取侵略行为”，可是不及二日，而美国的军用飞机竟在我东北领土的上空，沿鸭绿江右岸扫射我车站、车辆、建筑物和我国人民，先后有飞机十三架进行五次的侦察和扫射，使我同胞受伤者达二十一人，死者三人，这种罪行，正好给奥斯汀无耻谎言以有力的回击，而为中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    美帝这一侵略和挑衅的行为不是偶然的，它是继美帝第七舰队侵入我台湾海峡，第十三航空队和其他军事人员侵入我台湾领土以后，另一个武装侵略中国的行动；也是美帝对朝鲜侵略战争，在英勇的朝鲜人民抗战之下，而遭受惨败，因而，变为更野蛮的另一表现。
    我们愿告诉美国侵略者，中国人民已不再是帝国主义所能任意侵凌和屠杀的了，四万万七千五百万中国人民是一致地团结在中国共产党旗帜之下为保卫祖国和世界和平而坚决奋斗到底的！八月二十七日我周外长对美国务卿艾奇逊的抗议和对联合国安理会的请求，是中国人民一致的要求。中国农工民主党坚决拥护周外长这一严正的抗议和正义的要求。
    九三学社发表声明
    【新华社二十八日讯】九三学社发表声明抗议美机侵入我国领空、射杀我国人民的疯狂罪行。该声明如下：
    美帝国主义者于与开始侵略朝鲜的同时，即由战贩杜鲁门发表声明，派遣其驻太平洋第七舰队，武装干涉我国解放台湾。我周外长曾电联合国安理会，命令美国武装力量全部退去。正当美国国防部官员发表谈话，力图掩饰其侵台罪行时，美国侵略朝鲜的飞机，竟又于八月二十七日，在鸭绿江沿岸各地，连续侵入我东北上空，扫射我建筑物、车站、车辆，并伤亡我同胞多名。美国这种侵犯中国主权，残杀中国人民，并企图扩大战争，破坏世界和平的严重罪行，是中国人民所不能饶恕的。本社除绝对拥护我周外长八月二十七日给美国国务卿艾奇逊有关要求惩办侵入我领空的美国空军，赔偿一切损失，担负全部责任及其后果的严重抗议外，并望联合国安理会即时严厉制裁美国侵略朝鲜及在中国领土内所作的挑衅和残暴行为。
    青年团中央发表声明
    【新华社二十八日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会发表抗议美国飞机侵入我国领土上空、扫射我国人民的声明如下：
    我们中国的青年和中国新民主主义青年团员，严重抗议美国飞机侵入我国领土上空，扫射我国人民的挑衅和残暴行为。我们坚决拥护周外长致联合国安理会的电文中所提的要求及向美国政府所提的抗议，并充分准备着在我中央人民政府领导下，为粉碎美帝国主义的侵略而斗争。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会  八月廿八日
    全总等五人民团体联合抗议美国侵略
    【新华社二十八日讯】中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会、中苏友好协会总会五人民团体联合抗议美国飞机侵入我国领空、扫射我国人民的犯罪侵略行为。抗议全文如下：
    美国侵略朝鲜军队之军用飞机于八月二十七日多次侵入我国领土上空，并在临江、安东等地扫射我建筑物、车站、车辆，死我国同胞三人、伤二十一人，这次事件又一次地证明美国杜鲁门政府侵略我国的政策正在疯狂地进行。美国帝国主义者这种无耻残暴的挑衅行为，已引起全国人民无比的愤恨，我们代表全国人民全国工人阶级，坚决拥护与支持周外长向美国政府的严重抗议及向联合国安全理事会的控诉和建议，要求美国政府立即惩办美国空军此次挑衅和残暴罪行，负责赔偿中国方面所受的一切损失；要求联合国安全理事会制裁美国侵略朝鲜军队的这种侵入中国领空的挑衅和残暴行为，并应立即采取措施，使美国政府完全撤退其在朝鲜的侵略军队，以免事态扩大，保持亚洲和世界的和平与安全。
