　　"The Words of the Weather" (Excerpt)
　　——Chapter 7 of Ilin's "Man's Conquest of Nature"
　　Bombarding the Sky
　　Meteorologists are trying to shake the clouds—like shaking a test tube—to make many small droplets of water coalesce into large ones. To stir them up like churning cheese. But how can one stir up a cloud?
　　Once, about forty years ago, there was a war in Texas, USA. Cannons roared, shrapnel exploded, and rockets burst in the sky with a hiss. They were bombarding the clouds in the sky, but this time the command was composed not of officers but of meteorologists. They bombarded all day, and towards evening, a few drops of rain finally fell. These few droplets of water were extremely expensive. For this small amount of rain, they used four hundred and seventy-five bombs, sixty-eight balloons, six hundred and fifty pounds of explosives, and countless shells. Bombarding clouds was not cost-effective, and meteorologists decided to come up with other methods to replace it.
　　Rain and Politics
　　If we want to learn how to control the weather, there is still much we need to study. It is not enough to be just a meteorologist; one must also be a chemist. When clouds form, the air is a huge chemical laboratory where many chemical changes take place. These processes must be understood, and we must study the chemical changes in fog.
　　And even being a chemist at the same time is not enough. He must also be an electrician. The air is governed by various electrical forces. The small droplets of water that form clouds are all charged with electricity. Don't we all see terrible flashes of light—lightning—during thunderstorms?
　　He must also be a mathematician; he must derive correct mathematical formulas for all the phenomena we call snow, rain, hail, and sleet.
　　And even that is not enough. He must be an engineer with specialized skills. In order to make tools and machines for creating rain, he must be an accountant, in order to calculate how much money a certain amount of rain will cost, calculate the cost of making a cloud, and decide whether it is worth making rain.
　　Finally, he must also be a politician, in order to decide how to adjust the weather so as not to cause disputes in various regions where weather interests are inconsistent.
　　You see, to successfully control the weather, one must understand so many fields of knowledge! Yet scientific knowledge alone is still not enough. This must go through tens of thousands of experiments.
　　How can one person understand so much and do so many things? It is impossible for one person to do it alone. This requires not the work of one person but the work of thousands of people; not one laboratory, but hundreds of laboratories; not one science, but many branches of science.
　　Yet even that is still not enough.
　　A German scientist, Dr. Wendler, published a book in 1927 entitled "On the Question of Technical Influence on Climate." He wrote:
　　"If deserts are reclaimed and become fertile land, it may cause serious conflicts and lead to war, just as the competition for colonial markets can lead to war. Changing the climate in one place on Earth also changes the climate in another place. And this climate change will also cause war, unless its impact on other places is beneficial rather than harmful. And even if it is possible to change the climate within one's own country without affecting neighboring countries, it will cause serious disputes among many different groups within the country."
　　Dr. Wendler is not a politician, he is a scientist, but he clearly understands where the fundamental difficulty lies—that is, people have conflicting interests. To make everyone have common interests, the entire organization of human society must be changed.
　　Work Begins
　　In November 1933, Soviet scientists gathered in a assembly hall in Leningrad. There were physicists, but the topic of discussion was not physics; there were also chemists, but they were not just talking about chemistry. There were scientists from all scientific departments: meteorologists, mathematicians, electricians, astronomers, and others. They came from many cities to discuss the weather. They discussed it for more than three days.
　　These scientists were invited to attend this conference by the Institute of Experimental Meteorology. The Institute of Experimental Meteorology is one of the youngest research institutes in the world. At the same time, the science of experimental meteorology is also the newest science in the world. The institute is only two years old, and this science is only slightly older.
　　Before the meeting, Professor Obolensky, the leader of the institute, showed the guests many instruments and equipment. In the chemical laboratory of fog, he showed them a square box made of glass on all sides, like a huge cargo box. For the guests, he created real fog in this glass box, thick and white, just like the fog that rises from the river in the summer evening. According to the manager of this laboratory, this fog can last for eight hours or a little longer. But this time, they did not let it last that long.
　　The manager of the laboratory twisted an electric switch, and electric sparks burst in the box. Within three minutes, the fog disappeared.
　　The staff of the institute also showed the guests other instruments and equipment, and led the guests to visit a large glass house. Here, the laboratory for dissolving fog was conducted on a larger scale. They all climbed a narrow and winding staircase and ran to the top of a high tower. This tower is where PoPoV, the inventor of radio, often worked. Now they used this tower to test the effect of X-rays on clouds.
　　These experiments are unprecedented. But nature still has many closed doors, and we have not yet obtained the key. It may take decades before we find the key to open those closed doors.
　　Attacking Clouds with Smoke Screens
　　These experiments are not only being done in Leningrad. At the other end of our country, on the edge of the desert, the Turkmenistan Rain Institute is conducting similar experiments. Physicist Fedosayov is the head of this institute.
　　At a drought conference in 1931, Fedosayov reported on how he conducted the first experiments in making rain and stopping rain. He used smoke screen candles used in war. When these smoke screen candles were lit, a thick, black smoke rose into the sky. The wall of smoke was carried by the wind, and under its cover, the army began to fight.
　　But this time, they were not fighting against people, but attacking the weather.
　　A total of two experiments were conducted. At the beginning of the first experiment, there were almost no clouds in the sky. After they sent about two thousand cubic yards of charged smoke into the sky, within two hours the sky was filled with clouds and it began to rain, which lasted for eight minutes.
　　At the beginning of the second experiment, the sky was already filled with clouds, and it had been raining heavily for several hours. The question now was to stop the rain. This time, two thousand cubic yards of smoke with opposite charges were used. Forty minutes later, a large and round hole appeared in the cloud pile. Although it was still raining in other places, the rain had stopped under this round hole.
　　The above is what happened in 1931. Scientists did not want to boast about this as a true victory over the elements of nature. They knew they had to be extremely cautious and not draw rash conclusions from these experiments.
　　In fact, how can one distinguish between natural rain and artificial rain? How can one be sure that the rain stopped on its own or because of the experiment?
　　It was too early to draw conclusions at this time.
　　The Sky as a Laboratory
　　Not long ago, the Truth newspaper published an article describing the recent experimental work of the Turkmenistan Institute. In these experiments, Fedosayov and his colleagues attempted to control the atmosphere in the same way that chemists control solutions in test tubes.
　　It is easy for a chemist to extract minerals from a solution, to turn a clear solution into a cloudy one, or to make a cloudy solution clear. He only needs to sprinkle a pinch of crystals or salts, or add a few drops of another liquid.
　　The atmosphere is also a solution. It is a solution of water dissolved in the air. Sometimes this solution becomes cloudy, and water separates out to form rain, snow, or hail. Meteorologists and chemists have a common name for this, they call it "deposit."
　　The experimenters at the Turkmenistan Institute attempted to study whether the same methods used in chemistry could be applied to the atmosphere, to find a suitable compound and sprinkle it in the air.
　　The Truth newspaper's article tells us:
　　"Several agricultural aviation aircraft—'U-2' aircraft—flew high above several thick, dark clouds, scattering a specially made chemical powder. After about five or six minutes, gaps appeared in the thick clouds along the places where the powder was scattered, and at the same time the clouds began to change color. Before long, it became a translucent object, white and thin. When these clouds changed from dark gray to fluffy white, streaks of rain fell. At first, the raindrops were few and small, gradually becoming dense, gradually becoming larger, and then it formally began to rain, no different from natural rain in any aspect.
　　"In the third stage, the clouds began to split and dissolve, quickly shrinking, and finally disappearing completely.
　　"A second set of rainmaking experiments was conducted when the sky was full of thick clouds. These experiments were 90% successful, creating a lot of rain. Generally speaking, aircraft do fifteen to twenty minutes of guerrilla work, and the area of rainfall is about twenty kilometers."
　　Aviator Chizhevsky has an interesting record describing his experience of carrying out the orders of the Rain Institute in the clouds:
　　"After I flew into the cloud layer, I passed through it from several directions. Everything was still and silent. There was not a single drop of water on my hat brim or on the wings of the plane. After I scattered the powder, I flew out of the cloud layer and circled below. The rain began to fall. Then I plunged into the cloud for the second time, and this time I found myself in the rain, my hat brim immediately got wet, the fog rushed to my face, and the plane swayed from side to side, as if in an air pocket. At all times there was that hissing sound, which people often hear when they drive an airplane through rain clouds."
　　All these experiments must be carefully reviewed. All that has been accomplished is actually just raising the question. It is still too early to predict how this problem will be solved and when it will be solved. Controlling fog has now been opened, but artificial rain is only a matter for the future. Clouds cannot be tamed in a day.

　　“天气的话”（节录）
    ——伊林著《人类征服自然》第七章
    轰击天空
    气象学家尝试着摇动云——像摇动一支试管一样，——使许多小的水滴结成大的水滴。像搅乳酪一样把它们搅起来。但是怎样能够搅动一块云块呢？
    有一回，大约四十年以前，美国泰克萨斯洲（Texas）曾经有过一次战争。大炮轰轰地吼叫着，榴霰弹爆炸着，火箭在天空中爆发着，嘶嘶的响。他们是用炮轰击空中的云，不过这次战争的指挥部不是由军官而是由气象学家所组成。炮轰了一整天，到将晚的时候，总算有几滴雨水落下。这一点儿的水滴，代价高到极点。为了这一点点很少的雨水，他们用去了四百七十五枚炸弹，六十八个气球，六百五十磅炸药和无数的炮弹。轰击云块是不合算的，气象学家决定要想出别种方法来代替。
  雨和政治
    倘使我们要学会如何控制天气，那我们所要研究的东西还多得很。单单是一个气象学家是不够的，他还一定要是一个化学家。当云块形成的时候，空气是一个巨大的化学实验室，在这里起着许多的化学变化。这些过程非被了解不可，我们必须研究雾的化学变化。
    而且就算同时是一个化学家还是不够。他必须同时是一个电学家。空气被各种电的力量统制着。那些形成云块的小水滴都带着电。我们不是都能够在暴风雨的时候看到可怕的电光——闪电吗？
    他还必须是一个数学家，对于这一切我们所称为雪、雨、雹、霰的种种现象，他必须要求出正确的数学公式。
    而且就是这样也还是不够。他必须是一个有专门技术的工程师，为了要作出造雨时用的工具和机器，他必须是一个会计学家，为了计算出一定量的雨水要耗费多少钱，计算出制造一块云的成本，决定值得不值得去制造雨水。
    最后他还必须要是一个政治家。为了决定应当如何去调整天气，使得不致引起对于天气利害不一致的各地域的纠纷。
    你们看：要把天气控制成功，一个人必须懂得多少学问！然而单是科学上的知识依旧是不够的。这必须要经过了几千几万次的实验才行。
    一个人到底怎么能够懂得这许多，并做这么多的事情呢？一个人单独去做是不行的。这需要的不是一个人的工作而是几千人的工作；不是一个实验室，而是几百个实验室；不是一门科学，而是许多门类的科学。
    然而就是这样，还仍旧是不够的。
    一位德国的科学家温特勒博士（Dr.Wendler），在一九二七年发表了一本著作，书名是“关于技术影响气候的问题”。他这样写：
    “如果沙漠被开垦成为肥沃的土地，它就可能造成严重的冲突并引起战争，正和殖民地市场的争夺会引起战争一样。在地球上某一个地方改变气候，同时也就改变了另一个地方的气候。而这种的气候改变，也会引起战争，除非它对于别个地方的影响是有利而不是有害。而且即使能够在本国内改变气候而不影响到邻近国家，也会引起本国内许多不同的集团相互间的严重纠纷。”
    温特勒博士不是一个政治家，他是一个科学家，然而他却很清楚地了解基本的困难在什么地方——这就是，人们有着互相冲突的利害关系。要使人人都有共同的利害关系，人类社会的全部组织必得改变过。
  工作开始
    一九三三年的十一月，苏联的科学家们聚集在列宁格勒的一个大会堂中，这里有物理学家，可是讨论的题目并不是物理学；也有化学家，可是他们所谈的并不单是化学。这里有一切科学部门的科学家：气象学家、数学家、电学家、天文学家以及其他。他们从许多城市中跑来，讨论关于天气的问题。一共讨论了三天多。
    这些科学家是实验气象学研究院邀他们来参加这个会议的。实验气象学研究院是世界上最年轻的研究院之一。同时实验气象学这一门科学也是世界上最新的科学。这研究院只有两岁，而这门科学只比它稍微大了一点。
    在开这会议以前，这研究院的领袖沃博伦斯基教授（Obolensky）给这些客人看许多仪器和设备。在雾的化学实验室里面。他给他们看一个四面都是玻璃做的方箱，像一只巨大的货箱。为了客人他在这只玻璃箱里面制造出真正的雾，浓厚而白，和夏天黄昏时在河面上升起的雾一样。据这实验室的管理者说，这雾可以保持八个钟头或八个钟头多一点儿。可是在这次，他们并不让它维持那么长久。
    实验室的管理者扭一扭电开关，在箱子里就有电花爆发，三分钟之内，这雾就消失了。
    研究院的职员们还把其他的仪器和设备给客人们看，把客人们领到一间大的玻璃屋子里面去参观。在这里，消解雾的实验室在更大的规模上进行。他们全部爬上一个狭而弯曲的楼梯，跑到一个高塔的顶上。这个塔，就是那发明无线电的朴朴夫（PoPoV）常常在这里工作的。现在他们利用了这个塔来试验Ｘ光线对于云的影响。
    这些试验是以前所没有的。但自然界至今还有许多关闭着的门户，我们至今没有得到那钥匙。等到我们找到了钥匙把那些关闭着的门户打开，恐怕还要几十年的工夫。
  用烟幕来攻击云
    做这些试验的不仅仅是列宁格勒一处。在我们国家的另一端，沙漠的边上，土耳克门斯坦雨研究院（Turkmenistan  Rain Institnte）正在作着同类的试验。物理学家斐杜沙也夫（Fedosayov）是这个研究院的负责人。
    在一九三一年一次旱灾会议上，斐杜沙也夫报告他怎样举行初次的制造雨和停止降雨的实验。他应用了战争中所用的烟幕烛。当这烟幕烛被点着的时候，一股浓重而黑色的烟升上天空。这种烟的墙壁被风带着走，在它的掩护之上，军队就开始作战。
    不过在这次，他们并不是跟人作战，而是对天气攻击。
    这一共作了两回实验。在开始第一次实验的时候，天空中几乎看不到一片云，他们把二千立方码左右的带着电的烟送上天空以后，在两个钟头内天空中就满布着云，并开始下雨，这雨下了八分钟。
    在第二次实验开始的时候，空中正满布着云，而且已经下了几个钟头的大雨。现在的问题是要止住雨。这回用了二千立方码带着相反的电荷的烟，四十分钟以后，云堆里现出了一个大而圆的空洞。别的地方虽然还在继续下雨，可是在这圆洞下面，雨是停止了。
    以上是一九三一年的事情。科学家们并不想把这当作对自然原素的真实胜利而夸耀着。他们知道他们必须极端谨慎，不能对这些实验下轻率的结论。
    事实上，怎样能区别天然雨和人工雨呢？怎样能确定这雨是它自己停止的或是由于实验而停止的呢？
    这时候下结论是太早了。
  天空作为实验室
    不久以前，真理报发表了一篇文章，叙述土耳克门斯坦研究院最近的许多实验工作。在这些实验中，斐杜沙也夫和他的同伴们企图像化学家控制试管中的溶液一样来控制大气。
    一个化学家从溶液中提出矿质，把澄清的溶液变成浑浊，或使浑浊的溶液变成澄清，是容易的。他只消撒下一撮结晶体或盐类，或者加进几滴别种液体就成。
    大气也是一种溶解体。它是溶解在空气中的水的溶解体。有时候这种溶解体变成浑浊，水就分离了出来而形成雨、雪或雹。气象学家和化学家对于这有一个共同的名字，他们称之为“沉淀物”（deposit）。
    土耳其斯坦研究院的实验者们企图研究：能不能对于大气应用和化学上所用的同样方法，找出某种适当的化合物，而把这撒在空中。
    真理报上的论文这样告诉我们：
    “几架农业航空用的飞机——‘Ｕ—２’号飞机——高飞到几块浓厚暗黑的云块上面，散播着一种特制的化学药粉。大约经过了五六分钟，厚厚的云块里沿着散播药粉的地方现出了空隙，同时云开始变换颜色。没有多久，它变成一种半透明的物体，白而稀薄。当这些云从暗灰色变成绒毛一样的白色的时候，就有一条条的雨丝落下来。起初，雨的点子很少并且很小，渐渐地紧密，渐渐下大，后来就正正式式地下起雨来，无论在那一方面都和天然的雨没有两样。
    “到了第三个阶段，云就开始分裂并消溶，很快地缩小，最后完全消失。
    “在天空满布着厚厚的云块时，又举行了第二套的造雨实验。这种实验有百分之九十得到成功，造成很大的雨。大概说来，飞机做十五——二十分钟的游击工作，降雨的地域约有二十公里。”
    航空家齐支纳夫斯基有一篇很有趣的记载，叙述他在云端里执行雨水研究院的命令时的经历：
    “当我飞进云层以后，我从几个方向穿过它。一切都静止无声。我的帽檐上和飞机的翼子上都没有一滴水滴。我撒下了药粉之后，就穿出云层，在下面绕着圈子。雨开始下降了。于是我又第二次钻入云里，这时我发现我自己在雨中，帽檐马上就淋湿，雾扑到我脸上，飞机向两边鼓荡着，如同在空气的袋子里。无时无刻不听到那种咝咝的响声，这种响声是人们驾了飞机穿过雨云的时候常常听到的。”
    对这一切实验必须加以谨慎的审查。那已经完成的一切其实只是把问题提出。要在现在预言这个问题如何解决、什么时候解决，还依旧嫌早。控制雾这一点现在已经开了端，可是人工造雨还只是将来的事情。云不是在一天之中可以使它驯服的。
