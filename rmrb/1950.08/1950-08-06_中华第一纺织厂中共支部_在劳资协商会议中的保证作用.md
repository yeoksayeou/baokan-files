　　The Guaranteeing Role of the Chinese Communist Party Branch of the China No. 1 Textile Factory in Labor-Management Consultation Meetings

　　The Labor-Management Consultation Meeting of the Shanghai East China No. 1 Textile Factory was formally established on April 27th. Since then, the factory's production has begun to shift from losses to breaking even. One of the important links in achieving this result is the correct implementation by the factory's Chinese Communist Party branch of the policy of "relying on workers and uniting with capitalists to improve production."

　　The situation of the China No. 1 Textile Factory was still good in the early days of the liberation of Shanghai. The factory had 5,000 dan of cotton in stock, which was estimated to last for six months. However, due to the losses suffered by the branch factory, the China No. 1 Knitting Factory, by the end of March, there were only 2,500 dan of raw cotton left, and it was burdened with debts of 1 billion yuan. Before and after the "February 6th" bombing, the branch had put forward the call of "improving production to overcome difficulties" among the workers, and the workers had also responded to the call by working hard to produce. However, the capitalists had always adopted a negative attitude towards production, wages were delayed, and it was planned to close the factory after the raw materials were used up. In mid-April, the capitalists announced that the cotton reserves would be depleted in two months. In this situation, the workers began to panic, and their production enthusiasm declined.

　　Although the factory established a labor-management symposium in mid-March, the two sides could not understand each other and failed to put forward unanimous opinions on improving production under the principle of "overcoming difficulties and improving production." In addition, there was insufficient preparation before the meeting, the meeting tasks were unclear, the method was rigid, and there were too many representatives (15 workers, 15 staff, the Youth League secretary, the factory manager, etc.). At the meeting, some staff members were afraid of offending the workers and dared not talk about the capitalists' difficulties; some even one-sidedly emphasized the workers' interests, which made the capitalists feel even more isolated. Therefore, although the meeting also learned about the factory's actual economic situation, it failed to solve the problem.

　　Faced with the increasingly serious difficulties of the factory, the branch called on everyone to implement the spirit of the Third Shanghai People's Congress: "Unite with the capitalists and improve production." At this time, the branch, on the one hand, mobilized the workers through the trade union and the Communist Youth League, improved their production enthusiasm, and called on the workers to start with increasing production, reducing waste, and saving raw materials, in order to achieve the goal of uniting with the capitalists to improve production; on the other hand, it proposed to improve the work of the labor-management symposium and reorganize it into a labor-management consultation meeting. After these opinions were brewed and publicized among the masses, the Municipal Labor Bureau promulgated the organizational regulations for the labor-management consultation meeting. Therefore, the branch, in accordance with the spirit of the regulations, worked with the Communist Youth League and the trade union to continue to widely publicize and explain among the masses, and explained to the capitalists the significance of reorganizing the labor-management symposium into a consultation meeting and the tasks of the consultation meeting. This initially reversed the sentiment of both labor and capital that they lacked confidence in the consultation, and enabled the two sides to achieve ideological unity, laying the foundation for the establishment of the consultation meeting.

　　The Labor-Management Consultation Meeting was formally established on April 27th. The meeting was composed of four representatives from each side, labor and capital. The capitalist representatives were one manager, two deputy factory directors, and one engineer (designated by the capitalist); the labor representatives were selected from the worker representatives of the original labor-management symposium (these representatives were directly elected from the workshops), and the chairman and vice-chairman of the trade union were the representatives. The number of representatives at this meeting was reduced, making it easier to focus the discussion; the strength of labor and capital was balanced, and the capitalists believed that they would not be isolated and gained confidence.

　　After the establishment of the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting, the branch continued to implement the resolutions of the Third People's Congress, and played a great role in uniting the capitalists through the trade union and the Communist Youth League in overcoming difficulties and maintaining production:

　　First, it initially achieved break-even production. In March, the labor and material cost per piece of 20-count yarn was 224.44 units, but at that time, the factory's actual labor and material cost was very high, and there were more losses. After the establishment of the Consultation Meeting, the capitalists hoped that the labor and material cost could be reduced to 229 units, and then gradually move towards break-even. They also put forward specific measures to save materials, electricity, and reduce food expenses. After studying these opinions, the branch believed that these opinions were very reasonable, and then launched publicity among the masses through the trade union and the Communist Youth League. The trade union held a production meeting to discuss and called on workers to put forward opinions and specific measures to improve production. After discussion, the masses unanimously agreed with this method, believing that "only by improving production can we find a solution" and "doing so is for the benefit of everyone." After the plan for saving and increasing production was adopted and implemented by the Consultation Meeting, the entire factory immediately launched a warm campaign to save and increase production. After a month of efforts by the employees, the standard of 224 units for the consignment spinning of the Cotton Yarn Cloth Company has been achieved, which is five units less than the 229 units proposed by the capitalist, and has initially achieved break-even and maintained production.

　　Secondly, the capitalists have begun to attach importance to the Consultation Meeting because the workers have made achievements, and their confidence in maintaining production has also increased. The workers' active labor has changed the capitalists' negative and wavering emotions, as well as their fear of talking with employees and their distrust of workers. Recently, in order to merge the loss-making knitting factory and enable the textile factory to continue to operate, the capitalists sincerely raised the issue of merging the two factories at the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting and sought the opinions of the workers.

　　Third, the workers' production enthusiasm has been greatly improved. During the period of saving and increasing production, the workers not only actively produced, but also put forward many positive suggestions for improving production. For example, Baoquangong Yan Miaosheng once suggested: "Steel wires should be copied three times, the garbage on the Doffer cover plate of the steel wire cart should be wiped off with cloth gloves, and the flower rolls should not collide with each other when pulling the rolls." Many veteran workers have also put forward many suggestions on labor discipline and saving electricity and materials, and these opinions have been adopted and implemented by the factory. Recently, the quality of the steel wire cart products has been improved; the speed of the roving cart has also been accelerated; the lights in the workshop are delayed until five minutes before work starts, and the brightness of the lights in the dormitory has also been reduced; and the cost of food has also been saved a lot. The general workers all reflect: "As long as the factory stays open, it doesn't matter if it's a little bit hard."

　　In the preliminary summary of the work of the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting, it was found that there are still several ideological understanding problems among the workers: First, some workers still believe that maintaining production is purely beneficial to the capitalists. Some people also mistakenly believe that the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting is just to intensify production and reduce treatment. Second, the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting does not have close enough contact with the masses, and some people believe that this is a matter for the trade union and activists. Therefore, the branch, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League must continue to pay attention to strengthening ideological education for the workers, and in the event of major issues, they should widely solicit opinions from the masses before the Consultation Meeting makes a decision; after the decision is made, the results should be deeply communicated to prevent the phenomenon of acting for others and being detached from the masses.

　　Editor's Note: The various tasks carried out by the Chinese Communist Party Branch of the China No. 1 Textile Factory are very necessary and are one aspect of overcoming the current difficulties of private enterprises. Generally speaking, there are still phenomena such as bloated and large organizations and unreasonable management methods in private enterprises. The branch of the factory should also pay necessary attention to this aspect at the same time.

### 中华第一纺织厂中共支部  在劳资协商会议中的保证作用

　　中华第一纺织厂中共支部
    在劳资协商会议中的保证作用
    四月二十七日沪东中华第一纺织厂劳资协商会议正式成立。从此该厂生产开始由赔累走上保本。获得这个成绩的重要环节之一是该厂中共支部对于“依靠工人，团结资方搞好生产”政策的正确贯彻。
    中华第一纺织厂在上海解放初期情况尚好，厂中有存棉五千担，估计可用半年。但由于受分厂中华第一针织厂亏蚀的牵累，到三月底只存原棉二千五百担，并负债十亿元。支部在“二六”轰炸前后，曾在工人中提出“搞好生产克服困难”的号召，工人也曾响应号召而努力生产。但资方对生产一直抱着消极态度，工资拖延不发，并计划在原料做完后就关厂。四月中旬资方又宣布两个月以后，就要将存棉吃光。在这种情况下，工人群众开始恐慌起来，生产情绪因此低落。
    三月中旬，该厂虽然成立了劳资座谈会。但由于劳资双方不能互相谅解，便不能在“克服困难搞好生产”的原则下一致提出改进生产的意见，加以会前准备不足，会议任务不明确，方式生硬，代表太多（工人十五人、职员十五人、团支书、厂方经理等），在会议上有的职员怕得罪工人，不敢说资方困难；有的甚至只片面地强调工人利益，更使资方感到孤立。所以虽然通过会议也了解了一些厂方的实际经济情况，但却未能解决问题。
    面对工厂困难日趋严重的情况，支部号召大家：贯彻上海三届代表会议精神：“团结资方，搞好生产”。这时支部一面通过工会和青年团去发动工人群众，提高生产情绪，并号召工人群众应从增加产品，减少浪费，节约原料做起，以达到团结资方搞好生产的目的；另一方面提出改进劳资座谈会工作，并改组为劳资协商会议。这些意见在群众中酝酿宣传后不久，市劳动局即公布了劳资协商会议的组织条例，于是支部又根据条例精神，协同青年团和工会，继续在群众中广泛地进行宣传解释，并向资方说明改组劳资座谈会为协商会议的意义及协商会议的任务。这样初步扭转了劳资双方对协商信心不足的情绪，使双方取得了思想上的一致，为协商会议的成立打下了基础。
    四月二十七日劳资协商会议正式成立。会议由劳资双方各派四人组成。资方代表是经理一人、副厂长二人、工程师一人（由资方指定）；劳方代表是从原劳资座谈会的工人代表（这些代表是从车间直接选举产生的）中遴选，其中工会正副主任为当然代表。这次会议组成的代表减少了，讨论容易集中；劳资双方力量平衡，资方认为这样就不会被孤立而有了信心。
    劳资协商会议成立后，支部继续贯彻三次代表会议的决议，通过工会，青年团教育工人团结资方，在克服困难维持生产上起了很大作用：
    首先是初步达到了保本生产。在三月份，二十支纱每件工缴费为二二四·四四单位，但是当时该厂实际工缴成本很高，赔累较多。协商会议成立后，资方希望工缴成本能减至二二九单位，然后逐步走向保本。并提出了节约物料、电量、减低伙食开支等具体办法。支部研究这些意见后，认为这些意见甚为合理，便通过工会、青年团在群众中展开宣传。工会召开生产会议进行讨论，号召工友们提出改进生产的意见和具体办法。经过讨论，群众一致同意这个办法，认为“只有搞好生产，才有办法”，“这样做是为了大家的利益”。节约增产计划由协商会议通过执行后，全厂立即掀起了热烈的节约增产运动。经过职工一个月的努力，已达到了花纱布公司代纺的二二四单位的标准，比资方所提出的节省到二二九单位减少了五个单位，初步达到了保本，维持了生产。
    其次，资方因工人们已作出成绩，所以对协商会议开始重视，维持生产的信心也随之提高。工人积极劳动的结果，转变了资方消极动摇的情绪，以及怕和职工商谈，不相信工人的思想。最近为了并缩亏累的针织厂，使纺织厂能继续维持，资方诚恳地在劳资协商会议上提出了二厂合并的问题，征求工人意见。
    第三，工人群众生产情绪大大提高。在节约增产时，工人们不但生产积极，并且提出了很多改进生产的积极建议。如保全工严妙生曾提出：“抄钢丝要抄三遍，钢丝车道夫罩板上的垃圾应用布手套揩去，拉卷子不可将花卷互相碰撞。”很多老工人也提出不少关于劳动纪律及节约电力物资的建议，这些意见都被厂方采纳和实行了。最近钢丝车产品质量已有提高；粗纱车速度也加快了；车间里的灯延迟到上工前五分钟才开，宿舍电灯光度也减小了；菜金也节省不少。一般工人都反映：“只要厂开下去，苦一点没关系。”
    在初步总结劳资协商会议工作时，发现在工人群众中尚存在着以下几种思想认识问题；第一是部分工人还认为维持生产是单纯对资方有利的事。也有人对劳资协商会议误认为只不过是加紧生产减低待遇而已。第二，劳资协商会议和群众的联系还不够密切，部分群众认为这是工会和积极分子的事。因此，支部、工会、青年团均须继续注意加强对工人的思想教育，而在遇有重大问题，在协商会议未决定之前，应广泛征求群众意见；决定后应将结果深入传达，以防止发生包办代替脱离群众的现象。
            （海）
    编者按：中华第一纺织厂中共支部所进行的各项工作是非常必要的，是克服目前私营企业困难的一个方面。一般说来，私营企业中还存在着机构臃肿庞大，经营方法不合理等现象。该厂支部，在这一方面应同时给予必要的注意。
