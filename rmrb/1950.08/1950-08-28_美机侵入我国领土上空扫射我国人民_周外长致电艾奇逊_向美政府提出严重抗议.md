[Xinhua News Agency, August 27th] My Central People's Government Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Enlai, regarding the incident of American aircraft invading China's airspace, straffing our buildings, stations, vehicles and Chinese people, resulting in casualties, cabled the United States Secretary of State, Acheson, lodging a serious protest with the United States government, and demanding that the United States government punish the United States Air Force and compensate for all losses. The text of Foreign Minister Zhou's cable is as follows: Washington, Mr. Acheson, United States Secretary of State:

According to reports from my Northeast People's Government, on August 27th, military aircraft of the American invading Korean army invaded the airspace of the People's Republic of China, straffing our buildings, stations, vehicles, and Chinese people along the right bank of the Yalu River, resulting in casualties, the situation is extremely serious. The facts of the incident are as follows: At 10:04 AM today, two American B29 aircraft flew to the airspace above Jian City and its vicinity, in the middle reaches of the right bank of the Yalu River, circling and reconnoitering for more than ten minutes. At 10:05 AM on the same morning, four American aircraft, including three P51 aircraft and one Mosquito aircraft, flew to the airspace above Linjiang City and the Dalizi train station area in the upper reaches of the right bank of the Yalu River, first straffing the Dalizi train station for two minutes, then straffing the railway line for two minutes, destroying one locomotive. At 11:04 AM, in the same area, another four American aircraft straffed the Jiangqiao area for eleven minutes, destroying two locomotives, one passenger car, and one guard car, injuring one driver and one resident. At 2:30 PM on the same day, one American B29 aircraft flew to the airspace above Andong in the lower reaches of the right bank of the Yalu River, circling and reconnoitering for one week. At 4:40 PM, two American P51 aircraft came to the airspace above Andong Airport, straffing for two minutes, injuring nineteen workers, killing three, and destroying two trucks.

Regarding the above-mentioned provocative and brutal acts of the American invading Korean army in invading Chinese territory airspace, I hereby lodge a serious protest with the United States government on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. The United States government should bear full responsibility and consequences for the actions of the American military in violating China's sovereignty and killing Chinese people. I request the United States government: (1) To immediately punish the provocative and brutal crimes of the United States Air Force in invading our airspace, injuring and killing our people, and destroying our vehicles; (2) To be responsible for compensating all losses suffered by the Chinese side.

I also declare on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China: We reserve all rights to continue to make demands regarding such provocative and brutal crimes by the American invading Korean army.
