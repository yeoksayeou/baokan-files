　　Harvest of Peace
    ——In the Fields of Stavropol
    Soviet Union Ｃ. Babayevsky
    Usually in July, at the height of the harvest season, the streets of Stavropol's villages and Cossack settlements are quiet and deserted. Only a few secretaries remain in the village soviets. In the management offices of the collective farms, there are only some bored old gatekeepers. Looking at the empty courtyards, the dust-covered trees near the streets, and the closed shutters, one cannot help but think: the people here know very well what the harvest season is.
    All those who can work have gone to the fields—to the ripe grains, to the machines, to the clean and compacted threshing grounds piled with mountains of wheat. Here, in the tawny space and under the scorching sun, life proceeds with a rhythmic and firm pace.
    Seemingly, there is no change. Like all summers, Stavropol remains hot. From morning till night, the fields are filled with the roar of machines. And as in all past years, the field teams' camps are crowded and noisy. As always, trucks loaded with grain speed along the field roads, raising dust. Fields lie scarred with haystacks where combine harvesters have passed. As before, grain sorters tirelessly clamor, and on the newly rolled roads, trucks loaded with wheat move from the combine harvesters to the threshing grounds.
    From the outside, this life seems ordinary and familiar to us all. Even if you were to traverse the entire plain from Mozdok’s Kursk to Dimitrovka near the border of Rostov Oblast—you probably wouldn't see anything new.
    Only the general scene of the harvest work is so familiar and dear in the collective farm fields. People have harvested grain here year after year, just as they do now. Everyone is used to this phenomenon, and often one summer doesn't seem much different from another.
    In reality, one only needs to shift one's gaze away from the convoys of trucks or combine harvester teams scattered across the fields, to go to the groups of people operating the machines, those pouring grain into the truck beds, to simply talk with people—then, in front of you, this July completely transforms into something else, and in many places, it is entirely different from the Julys of past years.
    Indeed, in this July, there are many new brands of Soviet machines—both harvesters and grain cleaners. And as in past years, there is a high rate of labor productivity—with the growth of technology, the skills of mechanical hands are also increasing daily. In the Lenin Collective Farm in the Lysogorsk Cossack village alone, seventy people work with harvesting cultivators and machines.
    The freshest thing that one can feel in this July can first be seen in the people, in their attitude towards labor, and in their views on life. In these days, peace leaflets calling for a ban on atomic weapons have been seen at the combine harvester teams and in the harvesting work of the groups. On these leaflets, thousands of hands of collective farm villagers have signed their names. People call this year's harvest of the land's masters the harvest of peace. The life of Stavropol farmers in this July is inseparable from the lives of millions of fighters for peace against American and British aggressors. On the combine harvesters, one can see slogans such as: "We support peace with words and deeds." Convoys of trucks transport grain to the granaries, and on the leading trucks, it is beautifully written: "Freedom and independence belong to the Korean people," "Stalin—the banner of peace." In these memorable days, no matter who you see—in their eyes is a clear hatred for those who have placed their bloody hands on Korean soil. No matter who you talk to, their first word is peace.
    We are at the Lenin Collective Farm. Its fields extend twelve kilometers from the Lysogorsk Cossack village, covering six thousand hectares. Tawny wheat fields rise from the lowlands to the sloping highlands. The wide, harvested furrows form dark strips across the fields. Two combine harvesters are moving across the fields. In the front, the "С-80" tractor proudly drives, its wheel bands gleaming as they rub against the ground. From a distance, the machines appear grand and solemn against the yellow background. The powerful song of the engine resounds throughout the fields. The tractor driver, with his hands on the control levers, looks now at the combine harvester operators, now at Vasily Trofimovich Garelin, who is alongside him. Vasily Garelin—still a young man, broad-shouldered, sturdily built, with a clearly defined and intelligent face, with a few gray hairs in his black hair—looks like a man who has experienced much in life.
    "You are asking about my signature?" Vasily Trofimovich asks, pausing, picking up a wheat ear, crushing it with his rough, hard palm, and gently pouring the wheat grains from one hand to the other, saying:
    "These things are our signatures, mine and those of our collective farm members. But my signature, so to speak, is special. That is..." he points to the tractor driving away, "look at those track bands, they are very familiar to me. I rode on such track bands, passed through foreign lands, and subdued the mad Hitler. I used to be a tank driver. I saw: the civilians of the whole world, like me and my comrades working on this combine harvester, are filled with the determination not to beg for peace from Truman, Churchill, and their servants, and are determined to stop the instigators of new wars and destroy all their aggressive and bloody conspiracies."
    At this time, the machines stop. Combine harvester operator Alexei Antonovich Kuchura gets down from the combine harvester's driver's seat and begins to check the work of those transporting the grain piles. Vasily Garelin quickly walks to the combine harvester operator and asks:
    "Alyosha, is the stop long?"
    "Don't worry, we'll be going soon," and as the combine harvester starts moving again, Vasily Trofimovich, as if continuing the interrupted conversation, says:
    "You don't know our Alexei Antonovich yet, he is a remarkable person. He never leaves the combine harvester for a moment. Look at his face—he practically lives entirely for his machine. He signs the manifesto without leaving his driver's platform. Oh, it would be so good if you could see him when he picks up a pen to sign the declaration. He is an extraordinary person. That is why I like Alexei. Why? Because at work, during breaks, in conversations, he completely transforms into another person. For example: if yesterday, linking two combine harvesters together, he harvested thirty hectares of land in a day, then the results of this harvest will exceed forty hectares. And people like Alexei Antonovich are not alone here. Look at how many there are in the fields. In our Lenin Collective Farm alone, there are five combine harvester teams. Now we call them combat teams. We challenge our neighbors—the combine harvester operators of the Georgiev Tractor Station. They also have their own combat teams."
    We drive through the boundless space of the Stavropol fields. Everywhere we see people who are combative and brave in labor. Talk to any mechanic, and he will say:
    "Today I will harvest more than yesterday, and tomorrow I will harvest even more. This is my answer to the instigators of war."
    As usual, near each team, there is a threshing ground cleared of grass roots and compacted. This place in the field is particularly crowded and lively. For example, trucks loaded with amber-yellow wheat drive out from here. Here the "Vienim" (BNM)—a compound grain cleaner—is working. Large piles of grain are arranged in a row. Women wearing straw hats—a good way to protect against the scorching sun—use wooden shovels to turn the grain and put the wheat into the winnowing fans. And the young, lion-nosed female weigher immediately weighs the grain ready to be sent out.
    During a short break, a conversation suddenly starts. The mothers and wives of former soldiers and the daughters of fallen fathers gather in a small circle. The conversations are all about the same thing—declarations, peace, Korea. The women's faces are serious. They know very well what disasters war brings to the people. And when the conversation turns to the Korean issue, curses fall on the atomic bomb supporters Truman and Churchill. The people know very well that under the guise of "aiding" Syngman Rhee, the American war instigators' own task is to strangle the freedom-loving Korean people and seize Korea.
    Collective farm member Maria Ivanovna Khalina puts it well:
    "In my Cossack village, I was the first to sign the declaration. I, an ordinary woman, demand peace. And in recent days, I think I am not alone in the whole world. In our Soviet country and abroad, there are many of us women. If all the people say in one voice: we want to labor and live in peace, then what will happen?"
    It seems that this question not only excites Maria Ivanovna but also excites all of us who were at the threshing ground at that time. Therefore, answers come from all directions:
    "Such power is on us, on the people."
    "The people can do anything."
    "We must grab all the filthy claws of the cursed atomic bomb supporters."
    "I mean not only grab, but also break it."
    "This is what I think, comrades!" said local agronomist Alexei Petrovich Malakhov: "All the eyes of the civilians are turned to our country, to our people. We are by nature peaceful and hard-working people. Look at this mechanized grain separator. It can alleviate so much of our labor. It is still new, it was only produced this year."
    Everyone looks at the grain separator. It shines with the color of grass.
    "What was it made for? For peaceful labor, to alleviate people's labor and to make people live better. Look at those grain piles, those automatic machines, and the driver Xiaomin Peter, Uladimirovich, why do we grow this grain? Why are we all working so hard? Only for peace. And what are our main expectations? The expectations are simple: we do not want war, but want to build a new life, therefore we are wholeheartedly with the people of Korea, China, Bulgaria, Romania, Poland, Hungary, Little Albania, and Czechoslovakia. We also extend our hand to the working people of America. This is what I think: we have never had so many friends as in these days of July. And this is a huge force.
    "Maria, Ivanovich, this is the answer to your question," said one of her friends.
    On another threshing ground, calculator Paul Fedorovich Ershov lies on a spread-out coat, calculating the amount of threshed grain. Line after line of numbers fills every page of that notebook. Not far from him, the sound of the winnowing fan is very loud. The girls of the youth team are working there. They are wearing huge hats made of straw. Marusia Chernousova, wiping her red face with a handkerchief, goes to Ershova:
    "Hey, Paul, Fedorovich, how is our summary coming along?"
    "It increased."
    "But how is it in the wide world? How is the summary there?"
    "Do you want to know?"
    "Not me alone, but all the girls."
    "Then call them over, let's take a break and talk."
    And the conversation starts again on the same thing, just as people are talking about everywhere in these days. The speakers read the latest news, talk about the events in Korea, and the various gatherings in Moscow factories, the fields of Ukraine, Stavropol, and Kuban.
    Young faces show concentration and focus. From the thoughtful and serious eyes, one can see—in their hearts, these girls who are pleasant and agile at work have now gone far away from their Lysogorsk fields. And when the conversation ends, the girls go back to work and sing songs in a quiet and kind voice, songs that begin with the following words:
    Children of all nations of the world,
    We were born loving peace
    In this time of suffering
    We must fight for happiness.
    In the evening, Feodosia Savelyevna Komarova sits beside the wheat pile to rest. Already a not-so-young woman, with a pure Russian face and light-colored large eyes, she sits there deep in thought. I go to her and sit down beside her. I want to know what this woman is thinking, and I ask:
    "Tired?"
    "A little tired—that's true."
    "What are you thinking about so thoughtfully?"
    "Thinking about a big thing, but I just don't know how to express it in words."
    Feodosia Savelyevna grabs a few handfuls of wheat, sprinkles them on her apron, and for some reason, looks at the grain very attentively.
    "Everyone has been talking about signatures, talking about peace, talking about countries that are waging war. I hear it and don't speak. Although I don't speak, there is something indescribable in my heart."
    In the last war, when we fought with Hitler, I lost my husband. I am a mother. Believe me, I know very well how heavy my heart feels watching those children without fathers. Who took their fathers away? Hitler. And now who is preparing to take away the children's fathers and mothers? It is Truman.
    She is sprinkling wheat again, as if looking attentively at every grain of wheat.
    "About our lives, about the dear Stalin, I thought a lot, and I saw that all of us, all of our people, are united around Stalin in these days, as if grown-up children gathered around their dear father; we look at his bright eyes and say to all the people in the world: Stalin and his people now have only one thought and one concern—not to allow war..."
    I listened to the words of collective farm member Feodosia Savelyevna, and I understood: the words of the mother of the Lysogorsk Cossack village—this is the feeling and thought of all mothers.

### 和平的收获——在斯塔伏洛波里耶的田野上

　　和平的收获
    ——在斯塔伏洛波里耶的田野上
    苏联  Ｃ·巴巴耶夫斯基
    向来在七月，就是在收割的中心季节里，斯塔伏洛波里耶的各村庄和各哥萨克村的街道也是寂静无人的。在各乡村苏维埃里只有几位秘书。在各集体农庄的管理处里是一些呆得无聊的看门的老人，你看一下那些空着的院落，那些接近街道而上面蒙覆着尘土的树木，那些掩着的护窗板，你就不由得会想到：这儿的人们都很好地知道什么是所谓收获期的。
    只要是能够劳动的人们都出发到田野上去了——到成熟的谷物，到机器，到堆着如山的小麦的、扫得清洁而且轧得结实的打谷场那里去。这儿，在浅黄色的空间里，和灼热的阳光之下，人们的生活以有节奏而坚定的步调进行着。
    仿佛是见不出任何变动，和所有的夏天一样，斯塔伏洛波里耶还是那么暑热，原野上从早到晚都充满了机器的轰鸣声；并且也和在所有过去的年代里一样，作业班的营帐里是人多而嘈杂的，和向来的情形一样，装满粮食的载重汽车带起尘土飞驰在原野的道路上，装有束禾机的康拜因机走过的田野上，草堆像麻痕一样躺着；和从前一样，精选机不停地喧闹着，而从康拜因机到打谷场，在新轧过的道路上，满载着小麦的载重车向前移动。
    从外面看来，这生活是平常的，而对我们全体也早已是熟悉的，即使是走过从摩兹德加的库尔斯克到罗斯托夫省边境的季米托列夫卡这整片的原野——大概你也不会看到什么新鲜的东西的。
    只有那收获工作的一般情景，在集体农庄田野上是如此熟悉而亲切的。在这里人们逐年收获的谷物都和现在一样，大家对这种现象早已习惯，而往往是这一个夏天和另外一个夏天也并没有什么分别的。
    实际说起来，只须把眼光从分布在田野的道路上的那些汽车队或是康拜因机联合工作组那里移开，只须到那些操纵机器的人们，那些把粮食向车身里倾倒的人们的集团里去一下，只须和人们谈一下——则在你的面前，现在的七月就完全变成了另外一个，而在许多地方完全与过去那些年的七月不同了。
    真的，在今年的七月里，有很多新牌号的苏维埃机器——又有收获机、又有净谷机；并且和过去的年代一样，是又有高度的劳动生产率的——随了技术的增长，机械手的技艺也是逐日增高。仅在律索哥尔斯克哥萨克村的列宁集体农庄里，就有七十个人用收割耕机和作机工作。
    今年七月里，最使人感觉到的新鲜事物，首先就可以从人们，从他们对劳动的态度和他们对生活的见解这些地方看出来。这些日子里，在康拜因联合工作组和各组的收获工作上，曾见到了呼吁禁用原子武器的和平传单。在这些传单上，集体农庄乡村的劳动者们成千只的手都签上了自己的名字。人们把田地的主人们今年的收获叫做和平的收获。斯塔伏洛波里耶农夫们的生活，在这个七月里和成百万争取和平反对美英侵略者的斗士的生活是分不开的。在康拜因机上可以见到这样的标语：“我们用言语和事实来拥护和平。”成列的汽车把粮食运到大谷仓那里去，而在领头的那些汽车上面很好看地写着：“自由与独立属于朝鲜人民”，“斯大林——和平的旗手”。在这些可纪念的日子里，不拘是你看见了谁——在他们的眼里都显示着对于那把自己血腥的手放置在朝鲜土地上的人的公然的憎恨。不拘你和谁谈话，他们每一个人的第一句话就是和平。
    我们是在列宁集体农庄。从律索哥尔斯克哥萨克村起，它的田地延展十二公里，占地六千海克脱。浅黄色的小麦田地从低地开始上升到倾斜的高地，那宽阔的割去麦子的田垅在田地上面形成一些暗色的长条原野上面有两架康拜因机在走着。在前面，拖拉机“Ｃ—八十号”骄傲地行驶，它那和地面摩擦着的轮带闪着光。如果从远处来看，则在黄色背景上，机器看来是伟大而严肃的。摩托的有力的歌声响遍了整个的田野。拖拉机手，手不离开那操纵杆，一会儿望着那些康拜因机手，一会又望着和他并行的瓦西里，特洛菲莫维奇，加列林。瓦西里·加列林——还是个年轻的男子，宽大的肩膀，身体结实，轮廓分明而富于智慧的面孔，黑色的毛发上稍稍有一些灰色，看起来，这个人在生活上是有过不少的经历了。
    “您是问我的签名么？”瓦西里·特洛菲莫维奇问，停了停，拿起一个麦穗来，把它用粗硬的手掌揉搓碎了，而把麦粒从这只手倒到那只手轻轻地说：
    “这些东西就是我们的签名，是我的、也是我们集体农庄庄员的。但是我的签名，说起来是特别的。就是那个”他就指着走远了的拖拉机“看一下那些环带吧，它们对我来说是非常熟悉的。我乘在这样的一些环带上，穿过了国外的土地，镇平了疯狂的希特勒。我过去是个坦克手，我见到：全世界的平民，都和我与我那在这收割联动机上工作的同志们一样，是充满了决心不向杜鲁门、邱吉尔还有他们的仆从们请求和平的，并且坚决地要制止新战争的煽动者，摧毁他们一切侵略与血腥的阴谋。”
    在这个时候，机器都停下了。康拜因机手阿列克赛、安托诺维奇·库楚拉从康拜因机的司机台上下来，便开始检查运输谷堆的人们的工作。瓦西里·加列林快步地走到康拜因机手那里去问：
    “阿略莎，停得久么？”
    “不要着急，马上我们就走”，而当康拜因联动机又重新走起来的时候，瓦西里，特洛菲莫维奇，仿佛继续了打断的谈话似地，说：
    “你还不认识我们的阿列克赛·安托诺维奇呢，他是个了不得的人呢。一刻也不离开康拜因机。看一下他的面孔吧——他简直全部就是因为自己的机器而活着。他在宣言书上签名都不离开自己的司机指挥台。哦，如果您可以看到他拿起笔来在宣言上签名的那时候多么好。这是个了不起的人。这样我所以喜欢阿列克赛。为什么？因为在工作上，在休息时候，在谈话当中，他都完全变成了另外一个人。举个例子来说吧：如果昨天把两部康拜因机联结起来，他在一天割了三十海克脱土地，那么现在这次收获的成绩就要超过了四十海克脱。而像阿列克赛·安托诺维奇这样的人在我们这里并不是一个人。看一看在原野上这样的有多少吧。只是在我们的列宁集体农庄上，就有五个康拜因机工作组。现在我们把它们是叫做战斗联合工作组的。我们向我们的邻人们——高尔吉耶夫拖拉机站的康拜因机手——挑战。他们是也有自己的战斗联合工作组的。
    我们驶行在斯塔伏洛波里耶原野无边的空间里。到处我们见到具有战斗性的、在劳动中勇敢的人们。和任何一个机械士谈一下，他就会说：
   “今天我割得比昨天多，明天会割得更多的。这就是我对于战争煽动者的回答。”
    照例地，在每一个联合工作组的附近，都有一个清除了草根并且轧过了土地的打谷场。原野上这块地方是特别地人多而热闹的。例如从这里便有载着琥珀黄色小麦的载重汽车开出去，在这里有“维意姆”（ＢＮＭ）——复式净谷机——在工作着。粮食的大堆都摆成一行。妇女们带着草帽——防止灼热太阳光线的佳品——用木锨翻动粮食而把小麦放在扇车里面。而那位年轻的长着狮子鼻的女过秤员立刻便秤着准备送出去的粮食。
    在短促的休息时间里，突然谈起话来了。以前的战士们的母亲和妻子们和阵亡的父亲的女儿们，集合成一个小圈儿。谈话都是关于同一件事情的——宣言、和平、朝鲜。妇女的面孔是严肃的。她们知道得很清楚，战争会给人民带来了怎样的灾难。而当着谈话转到朝鲜问题上来的时候，咒诅便会落到原子弹拥护者杜鲁门和邱吉尔的身上。人民都很好地知道，在“援助”李承晚的名义之下，美国的战争煽动者们自己的任务是绞杀爱好自由的朝鲜人民而把朝鲜掌握在手里。
    集体农庄女庄员玛利亚·伊凡诺夫那·哈利娜说得很好：
    “在自己的哥萨克村里，我是第一个在宣言上签名的。我这一个平常的妇女要求和平。而在近来这些日子里，我想在全世界上我不是孤独的。在我们苏维埃国家和国外，我们妇女是有许多人的。如果所有的人们都异口同声地说：我们要和平地劳动并生活，那么会有什么事呢？”
    看来，这一问题不仅使玛利亚·伊凡诺夫那激动，而且使所有我们当时在打谷场上的人们激动。因而回答从四面八方传来：
    “这样的力量是在我们的身上，在人们身上。”
    “人民是什么都可以做到的。”
    “必须抓住所有可咒诅的原子弹拥护者们的污秽的爪掌。”
    “我的意思是不仅抓住，而且要折断它。”
    “我是这样想的，同志们！”地方农学家阿列克赛·别特洛维奇·马拉霍夫说：“一切平民的目光都转向我们的国家、转向我们的人民。我们本性上就是和平而爱劳动的人们。看一下这机械化的精选器吧。它可以减轻多少我们的劳动哟。它还是新的，是今年才出厂的。”
    大家都看着这精选机。它闪着草那样的绿颜色。
    “制造它是为了什么？为了和平的劳动、为了减轻人们的劳动并且叫人们生活得更好些。看一下那些粮食堆，那些自动机器，和司机萧敏·彼得，乌拉基米洛维奇吧，为什么我们种这些粮食呢？为什么我们都这样努力呢？只是为了和平。而我们最主要的一些期望是什么呢？期望是简单的：我们不愿战争，而要建设新的生活，因之我们是全心全意地和朝鲜、中国、保加利亚、罗马尼亚、波兰、匈牙利、小阿尔巴尼亚、捷克斯拉夫的各族人民在一起的。我们把手也伸向美国的劳动人民。我是这样想：从来我们没有过如此多的朋友像七月的这些日子一样。而这是一支巨大的力量。
    “玛利亚、伊凡诺维奇，这就是对于你这一问题的回答”她的一位女朋友说。
    在另一个打谷场上，计算员保尔·费多洛维奇·爱尔萧夫躺在摊开的外套上，盘算着脱谷粮食的数量。一行一行的数目字充满了那练习簿的每一页。离他不远的地方，扇车的声音响得很厉害。那里是青年工作组的女孩子们在工作着。她们载着巨大的，用麦秸编成的帽子。玛露西亚·却尔诺乌索娃用手帕擦着发红的脸，走到爱尔萧娃跟前：
    “喂，保尔，费多洛维奇，我们的总结怎么样了？”
    “增加了。”
    “可是在广大的世界上是怎么样呢？那里的总结怎么样呢？”
    “你要知道么？”
    “不是我一个人，是所有的女孩子们。”
    “那么把他们叫来，我们休息一下来谈谈。”
    而谈话仍重新谈到同样的事情，就和在这些日子里人们到处所谈到的一样。谈话者读着最近的一些消息，谈到朝鲜事件，和莫斯科各工厂，乌克兰的田野，斯塔伏洛波里耶和库班的各种集会。
    年轻的面孔上显现出凝注和专心的神情。从沉思而严肃的眼光上就可以看到——在心里面，这些工作时愉快而敏捷的姑娘们，现在已远远地离开自己的律索哥尔斯克田野了。而当着谈话终结了的时候，女孩子们便重新着手工作，并且用安静而亲切的声音唱着歌儿，歌儿的开头是下面的一些话：
    世界各民族的儿女们，
    我们生来热爱着和平
    在这苦难的年代中
    我们要为幸福去斗争。
    在傍晚的时分，费奥多西亚·沙维列夫那·科玛洛娃坐在小麦堆旁边休息。已是个不算年轻的妇人，有着纯朴的俄国人的面型和浅色的大眼睛，她坐在那里深思。我走到她跟前和她并排坐下。我要知道这个妇女在想着什么，而我就问：
    “累了么？”
    “有一些累了——这是真的。”
    “您这么深思地想着什么呢？”
    “想着一件很大的事情，可是，就不知道怎么把它用话表示出来。”
    费奥多西亚·沙维列夫那抓了几把麦子，撒在自己的围裙上而不知为什么非常注意地望着这些粮食。
    “大家都一直是在谈着签名，谈着和平，谈到进行战争的国家。我听到了而不说话。虽不说话而在我的心里有一种难以传达出来的东西”。
    在上一次战争里，在我们和希特勒战斗的时候，我失去了丈夫。我是做母亲的。请相信我，我知道得很清楚，看着那些没有父亲的孩子们我的心是感到何等的沉重。是谁夺去了他们的父亲？希特勒。而现在谁又在准备夺去孩子们的父亲和母亲呢？是杜鲁门。
    她又在重新撒着小麦，仿佛是在注意地望着每一粒小麦。
    “关于我们的生活，关于亲爱的斯大林，我想了很多，而我看到，所有我们、所有我们的人民在这些日子里都团聚在斯大林周围，就仿佛是长大的孩子们集结在自己亲爱的父亲的周围一样；我们望着他的明朗的眼睛而向世界上一切的人们说：斯大林和他的人民现在只有一个念头和一件关心的事——不允许战争……。”
    我听了集体农庄女庄员费奥多西亚·沙维列夫那的话而我就明白：律索哥尔斯克哥萨克村的母亲的话——这就是所有母亲的感情与思想。
