　　Rectification in Some Specialized Companies in Shenyang is Biased
　　Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Commerce Proposes Correction
　　[This News] According to the Northeast Daily, since the rectification movement of the Shenyang Municipal People's Government Bureau of Commerce entered the inspection stage on August 2nd, the vast majority of party and non-party cadres in most units have been involved in the enthusiastic rectification movement. While inspecting the work, each unit insisted on two hours of study every day, raising the cadres' thinking from specific work to the direction of policy thinking, and strengthening their confidence in the rectification. In terms of inspection methods, they can generally proceed from reality. For example, Shenyang Department Store Company and department stores combine the inspection of the work in the past six months with the current phenomena, which not only clarified the problems but also laid the foundation for summarizing and improving the work.
　　However, deviations occurred in some units, such as the Grain, Coal, and Trust Companies. The summarization of work started from concepts, fragmented, non-specific, and indiscriminately labeled, making the inspection work stay on the phenomenon, with a lot of materials but no central issues could be found. Various forums were also general and did not focus on preparing issues. Some units did not connect with reality but drilled into the horns of nouns, such as what is called commandism; what is called state-owned and public enterprises, etc. Some leading cadres also have a vague understanding, proposing: "To rectify, first rectify the bureaucracy of the branch." They did not study or analyze the opinions raised by the lower levels, but instead pursued the names of the people who raised the opinions, which resulted in dissatisfaction among the masses.
　　In order to correct the above deviations, the Rectification Committee of the Shenyang Municipal Bureau of Commerce has put forward three suggestions to each unit: 1. The inspection work should proceed honestly from reality, summarize the work according to the key work plan outline, and avoid starting from concepts. 2. Avoid holding unprepared meetings that cannot solve problems. 3. In conjunction with inspection and summary work, continue to study documents in depth.

　　沈阳部分专业公司整风有偏向
    沈市商业局提出纠正
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：沈阳市人民政府商业局的整风运动，从八月二日进入检查工作后，大部单位的绝大多数党与非党干部都卷入了热烈的整风运动。在检查工作的同时，各单位每天都坚持了两小时的学习，把干部思想从具体工作向政策思想的方向提高一步，并加强了对整风的信心。在检查工作的方法上，一般也都能从实际出发。如沈阳市百货公司，百货商店，把检查半年来工作的材料与目前现象结合起来检查，不仅弄清楚了问题，对总结与改进工作也打下了基础。
    但部分单位，如粮食、煤业、信托等公司却发生了偏差，总结工作是从概念出发，零碎、不具体、乱戴帽子，使检查工作停留在现象上，材料多却找不出中心问题。开各种座谈会，也是一般化，未有重点的准备问题。还有的单位并不联系实际，而在钻名词的牛角，如提出什么叫命令主义；什么叫国、公营企业等。有的领导干部认识也很模糊，提出说：“要整，首先把支部的官僚主义整一下”。对下面提的意见，不先加研究、分析，却去追查提意见人的姓名，结果引起群众不满。
    沈阳市商业局整风委员会为了纠正以上偏差，已向各单位提出三点意见：一、检查工作要老老实实从实际出发，按工作重点计划提纲，总结工作，避免由概念出发。二、避免少开无准备的、不能解决问题的会。三、结合检查与总结工作，要继续深入学习文件。
