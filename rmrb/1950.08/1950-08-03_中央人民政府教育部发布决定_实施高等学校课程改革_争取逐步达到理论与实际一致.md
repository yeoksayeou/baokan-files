Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The Central People's Government Ministry of Education issued the "Decision on Implementing Higher Education Curriculum Reform," the full text of which is as follows:

(1) The purpose of higher education in the People's Republic of China is to cultivate senior construction talents with a high level of culture, mastering the achievements of modern science and technology, and wholeheartedly serving the people, based on the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on cultural and educational policies, using educational methods that combine theory with practice.

(2) Over the past year, the educational content of higher education institutions across the country has undergone preliminary reforms and achieved certain results. However, a significant portion of the existing higher education curriculum is not yet new democratic, meaning it is not national, scientific, or mass-oriented, and cannot meet the needs of new China's construction. Therefore, the curriculum of higher education institutions across the country must be reformed in a planned and step-by-step manner, in accordance with Article 46 of the Common Program, to achieve consistency between theory and practice. On the one hand, we must overcome the empty dogmatic tendency of "academic pursuits for the sake of academic pursuits" and strive to integrate with the practical needs of national construction; this is the main direction of our existing higher education institutions. On the other hand, we must prevent the narrow pragmatism or empiricism that neglects theoretical learning.

(3) Higher education institutions should abolish politically reactionary courses in accordance with Articles 41 and 47 of the Common Program and open new democratic revolutionary political courses to eliminate feudal, comprador, and fascist ideologies and develop the idea of serving the people.

(4) Higher education institutions should use departments as teaching units for cultivating specialized talents. The curriculum of each department should closely align with the current and long-term needs of national economic, political, defense, and cultural construction, and implement appropriate specialization based on systematic theoretical knowledge. In accordance with the principle of streamlining, necessary and important courses should be focused on and strengthened, while redundant and unnecessary courses and content should be deleted, and efforts should be made to ensure the interrelationship and connection of various disciplines. When deleting redundant and unnecessary courses and content, careful consideration and multi-faceted discussion are required, and it is imperative not to act rashly. The courses offered by each school should be based on the actual needs of national construction and should not be established based on the availability of personnel.

(5) To strengthen the integration of teaching and practice, higher education institutions should establish close ties with government departments and their affiliated enterprises and institutions. Teachers in higher education institutions should appropriately coordinate with the work, production, and scientific research of the aforementioned departments; planned organization of student internships and visits should be implemented, and these internships and visits should be regarded as an important part of teaching. In order to effectively cultivate talents for national construction, government departments should assist the teaching, internship, and research of higher education institutions through the Ministry of Education, as an integral part of their own department's business. Government departments bear joint leadership responsibility with the Ministry of Education for intern students.

(6) To meet the needs of cultivating a large number of construction talents, higher education institutions should, depending on their specific conditions and under the leadership of the Ministry of Education, assist various construction departments in establishing various specialized courses, training classes, or correspondence courses, and their curriculum should be discussed with the relevant departments.

(7) Each department of higher education institutions should separately stipulate the length of study, generally three to five years. The actual teaching time of each semester should be at least seventeen weeks. The actual study time of students per week (including self-study and experiments) should be based on 44 hours, and should not exceed 50 hours at most. Extracurricular activities should not exceed six hours per week.

(8) Improving the quality of teachers and cultivating new teachers is the key to implementing curriculum reform. Therefore, teachers in higher education institutions across the country should strive to strengthen their political study, professional study, and research work. Teaching and research guidance groups should be organized for each major course, with teachers helping each other to improve the content and methods of teaching. The research work of research departments or institutes within higher education institutions should be strengthened in a planned and step-by-step manner, and this should be used as the main place for cultivating our national higher education faculty. Guidance and concern for teaching assistants and graduate students should be greatly strengthened, encouraging their active learning and research spirit, and cultivating them to become good teachers in the new China's higher education institutions.

(9) Compiling textbooks suitable for higher education institutions in new China with scientific viewpoints and methods is an important condition for implementing curriculum reform. Therefore, under the leadership of the Central People's Government Ministry of Education, a Higher Education Textbook Compilation and Review Committee will be established to compile and translate various suitable textbooks and reference books in a planned and step-by-step manner, in accordance with the spirit of Articles 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, and 47 of the Common Program. In the future, the teaching materials of each school, department, and subject should gradually be uniformly in the national language, except for foreign language departments.

(10) Higher education institutions across the country should, in accordance with the above principles and with reference to the various curriculum drafts discussed at the First National Higher Education Conference, formulate feasible curriculum and teaching plan drafts for each school based on the specific conditions of each school, and submit them to the Central People's Government Ministry of Education for approval and implementation.

(11) This decision shall be promulgated and implemented by the Central People's Government Ministry of Education after being approved by the Government Administration Council.

　　中央人民政府教育部发布决定
    实施高等学校课程改革
    争取逐步达到理论与实际一致
    【新华社二日讯】中央人民政府教育部发布“关于实施高等学校课程改革的决定”，全文如下：
    （一）中华人民共和国的高等学校的宗旨，为根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领关于文化教育政策的规定，以理论与实际一致的教育方法，培养具有高度文化水平、掌握现代科学与技术的成就并全心全意为人民服务的高级建设人才。
    （二）一年来，全国高等学校的教育内容，已经经过了初步的改革，也收到了一定的成效，但现有高等学校课程中相当大的部分还不是新民主主义的，即还不是民族的、科学的、大众的，还不能符合新中国建设的需要。因此全国高等学校的课程，必须根据共同纲领第四十六条的规定，实行有计划有步骤的改革，达到理论与实际的一致。一面克服“为学术而学术”的空洞的教条主义的偏向，力求与国家建设的实际相结合，这是我们现有高等学校主要的努力方向；另一面要防止忽视理论学习的狭隘实用主义或经验主义的偏向。
    （三）全国高等学校应根据共同纲领第四十一条和四十七条的规定，废除政治上的反动课程，开设新民主主义的革命的政治课程，借以肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想。
    （四）高等学校应以学系为培养专门人才的教学单位，各系课程应密切配合国家经济、政治、国防和文化建设当前与长期的需要，在系统的理论知识的基础上，实行适当的专门化；应根据精简的原则，有重点地设置和加强必需的和重要的课程，删除那些重复的和不必需的课程和内容，并力求各种学科的相互联系和衔接。在删除重复和不必需的课程和内容时，必须经过深思熟虑和多方面的讨论，决不可轻率从事。各校开设课程应按照国家建设的实际需要，不应因人设课。
    （五）为加强教学与实际结合，高等学校应与政府各业务部门及其所属的企业和机关，建立密切的联系。高等学校的教师应与上述部门的工作、生产和科学研究，作适当的配合；应该有计划地组织学生的实习和参观，并将这种实习和参观，作为教学的重要内容。政府各业务部门为了有效地培植国家建设人才，应以通过教育部，协助高等学校的教学、实习和研究，作为自己部门本身业务的构成部分。对于实习学生，各业务部门负有与教育部共同领导的责任。
    （六）为适应培养大量建设人才的需要，各高等学校应视其具体条件，在教育部领导下，协助各建设业务部门，设立各种专修科、训练班、或函授班，其课程与各有关业务部门商订之。
    （七）高等学校各系应分别规定修业年限，以三年至五年为原则；每学期的实际授课时间以满十七周为原则，学生每周实际的学习时间（包括自习及实验）以四十四小时为标准，最多不得超过五十小时。课外活动时间，每周以不超过六小时为原则。
    （八）提高师资的质量和培养新的师资是实施课程改革的关键，因此全国高等学校的教师应努力加强自己的政治学习、业务学习及研究工作，应就各项主要课程，组织教学研究指导组，由教师实行互助，改进教学的内容与方法；应有计划有步骤地加强高等学校内研究部或研究所的研究工作，并以此作为培养我们国家的高等学校师资的主要场所；应大大加强对助教及研究生的指导和关心，鼓励其积极学习和研究的精神，培养他们成为新中国高等学校的良好教师。
    （九）用科学的观点和方法编订为新中国高等学校所适用的教材，是实行课程改革的重要条件。因此在中央人民政府教育部领导下，成立高等学校教材编审委员会，根据共同纲领第四十一、四十二、四十三、四十四、四十五、四十六及四十七条规定的精神，有计划有步骤地编译各项适用的教材和参考书。今后各学校各系各科的教材除外国语文系科外，应逐步做到一律用本国语文。
    （十）全国高等学校应根据上述原则，并参考第一届全国高等教育会议中所讨论的各种课程草案，就各校的具体条件，制订各该校可行的课程及教学计划草案，报请中央人民政府教育部批准实行。
    （十一）本决定由中央人民政府教育部报经政务院批准后公布施行。
