　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 9th—All islands outside the Pearl River Estuary have been completely liberated. A unit of the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army, in coordination with the coastal defense艇 (tǐng) squadron, continued its advance on the 3rd of August towards the Dan'gan and Jiafeng Islands, which were still occupied by remnant bandits outside the Pearl River Estuary, and liberated these two island groups successively on the same day and the following day. According to preliminary statistics of the total battle results of our army's liberation of all islands outside the Pearl River Estuary: more than 300 bandits, including the commander of the bandit "Third Fleet," Qi Zhihong (killed, previously misreported as the commander of the "Second Naval艇 (tǐng) Team"), were killed or wounded, and more than 100 bandits were captured; seven bandit transport ships and gunboats were sunk, one bandit gunboat was captured (heavily damaged and sunk), and more than ten bandit ships, including the bandit "Third Fleet" flagship "Taihe," were damaged; ten artillery pieces of various types, two heavy machine guns, and more than seventy automatic rifles and rifles of various lengths, as well as a portion of other military supplies, were seized.
    Note: The islands outside the Pearl River Estuary (generally known as the Wanshan Islands) include seventy-five islands of varying sizes, distributed between Hong Kong and Macau and in the sea to their south. After the liberation of Hainan Island, Qi Zhihong, the commander of the bandit Third Fleet, led five warships, including the Taihe, fourteen gunboats, and a part of the Marine Corps, colluding with the notorious pirate Li Chongshi, occupying the islands, blockading the Pearl River, and using these islands as a base for dispatching special agents and bandits to infiltrate the mainland. Gui Yongqing, the bandit navy commander-in-chief, personally led nine warships in early May to "inspect the defense" and instruct the bandits on the tactics of conducting harassment and sabotage activities. However, under the continuous heroic attacks of our army, the remnant bandits were unable to gain a foothold, a part of them suffered annihilating blows, and the remaining bandits fled in disarray. Thus, the Pearl River "blockade" has been completely crushed, and the special agents and bandits fleeing in the interior of Guangdong and Guangxi have also lost their base.

　　我军攻占担杆、佳逢列岛
    珠江口外各岛屿全告解放
    完全粉碎了残匪对珠江的“封锁”流窜两广的特务土匪已失其依据
    【新华社汉口九日电】珠江口外所有岛屿已经全部解放。人民解放军第四野战军某部配合海防艇队，于八月三日继续向珠江口外尚为残匪盘踞的担杆、佳逢二列岛进击，于当日及次日先后解放此两列岛。我军解放珠江口外各岛屿的全部战果，据初步统计：毙伤匪“第三舰队”司令齐志洪（毙，前误报为“第二舰艇队”司令）以下三百余名，俘匪一百余名；击沉匪运输舰、炮艇七艘，俘匪炮艇一艘（伤重沉没），击伤匪“第三舰队”旗舰太和号等舰艇十余艘；缴获各式炮十门，重机枪二挺，自动步枪及长短枪七十余支及其他军用物资一部。
    按：珠江口外群岛（一般称为万山群岛）包括大小岛屿七十五个，分布于香港、澳门之间及其以南海中。海南岛解放后，匪第三舰队司令齐志洪即率太和号等五艘军舰、十四艘炮艇及陆战队一部与著名海匪李崇诗勾结，盘踞各岛，封锁珠江，并把这些岛屿作为派遣特务土匪潜入大陆的根据地。匪海军总司令桂永清曾于五月初亲率军舰九艘前来“视察防务”，指示匪众进行骚扰破坏活动的机宜。但在我军连续英勇进击下，残匪无法立足，一部遭歼灭性打击，余匪狼狈溃逃。至此，珠江“封锁”已被完全粉碎，而流窜于两广内地的特务土匪亦已失其依据。
