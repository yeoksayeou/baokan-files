Fellow Representatives:

This report will address the following four issues: the implementation of this year's production guidelines and tasks, the adjustment of industry and commerce, state-owned enterprises, and fiscal taxation.

First, regarding the implementation of this year's production guidelines and tasks.

In Mayor Nie's report on the 1950 work plan at the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference, it was pointed out that this year's central task is still to restore and develop production. To restore and develop production, we must first focus on "improving quality, reducing costs, increasing output, and expanding sales channels." In particular, the importance of "improving quality and reducing costs" has been emphasized in the resolutions of previous sessions of the People's Representatives Conference and in the reports and plans of the Municipal People's Government as the key to restoring and developing the city's production. This policy is correct. The city's production suffers from poor product quality and high costs due to the generally poor technology of factories, insufficient equipment, and shortcomings in business management. If this is not improved, production cannot be developed. On the other hand, our production must be oriented towards the broad masses of the people, especially the vast number of farmers. If we cannot provide them with high-quality and low-priced goods, establish urban-rural cooperation, and open up a vast market, production cannot be developed. Private enterprises have made achievements in production in the past six months. The average monthly output of most industries (such as ironworks, weaving and dyeing, dyeing, leather making, flour, knitting, rubber, vegetable oil, and brick kilns) in the first half of this year exceeded the average monthly output in 1949. Some industries (such as large factories in knitting and soap) have improved the quality of their products to a certain extent, and sales are better. State-owned enterprises have also made achievements in production. The main enterprises have basically completed their tasks, which will be discussed later, so I will not repeat them here.

The so-called restoration and development of production should not be blind. Instead, it should be based on the development of the social economy, the needs of the people, and the market supply of raw materials. We should provide guidance to public and private enterprises on their business direction. Some industries should be appropriately developed, some should maintain their original output, some should appropriately reduce production, and some industries that manufacture luxury goods and superstitious articles should be guided to change their business. In terms of guiding the direction of production, we have done some work in the past, which is generally appropriate. However, because we do not fully understand the national market and have not conducted sufficient investigation and research on the city's production and sales situation, some industries such as matches, which were already oversupplied, were not given timely guidance. This should be reviewed. From this, we have learned a lesson: in a situation where private enterprises and small producers still dominate, and we lack accurate statistics, it is impossible to make a production plan that includes both public and private enterprises. It is necessary to give private enterprises general guidance on their direction, but we can only give such guidance. It is estimated that the purchasing power of rural areas will increase after the autumn harvest this year, and the sales of some products may increase in the second half of the year. However, some products may still face the difficulty of overproduction. Therefore, we must pay attention to changes in market conditions at all times to avoid blindness in production.

Second, regarding the adjustment of industry and commerce.

As a result of the implementation of the central government's decision to unify financial and economic work across the country, the national economic situation has begun to improve. The adverse situation of inflation and high prices that has persisted for twelve years has changed. The city's prices began to fall from late March and gradually stabilized after late May. The broad masses of citizens have benefited from a stable life, and industry and commerce are moving towards a normal development future.

However, in this economic change, industry and commerce inevitably encounter some unavoidable but surmountable temporary difficulties. After late March, the number of private businesses closing down exceeded the number of businesses opening up. The ratio of openings to closings was one to three in April, one to two before May 20, one to one after late May, and since June, the number of openings has slightly exceeded the number of closings, and more than 40 large merchants have withdrawn their applications for closure. From March to the end of June, a total of 1,821 businesses closed down and 996 businesses opened up, with openings accounting for 54.6% of closings. The most closures were in industries that were not suitable for the needs of the people, speculative, or oversupplied. Although industry also encountered difficulties, the situation was slightly better than that of commerce. From March to the end of June, statistics for 21 industrial sectors showed that 826 businesses opened with 3,730 employees, and 490 businesses closed with 2,111 employees. After offsetting each other, there was a net increase of 336 businesses and 1,619 employees.

In order to overcome the difficulties encountered by industry and commerce, we have conducted extensive and detailed investigations and research. Starting in April, we have taken the following measures based on the spirit of the central government's adjustment of industry and commerce, the specific situation of the city's industry and commerce, and after soliciting opinions from all relevant parties:

(1) Through labor-management consultation, adjust labor-management relations and overcome difficulties together.

First, the Municipal Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions called for the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings to actively improve production and management. Labor disputes were properly resolved. Thirteen industries and more than 40 factories and businesses have now been established.

Enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, have development prospects, but are temporarily experiencing business difficulties or even losses, are allowed to temporarily reduce wages. For example, Jingwei Weaving Factory reduced wages by 19% to 39%. Some workers and shop assistants voluntarily stopped receiving wages or deferred wages in addition to the food provided by the capital, some temporarily returned home on a rotating basis with their positions retained but without pay, and some temporarily reduced their food.

Second, improve labor discipline, increase work efficiency, and temporarily increase working hours to reduce costs and increase output. For example, some employees in the front counters of Chinese medicine stores voluntarily participated in the work of making medicine in the back counters after work.

As for those who must reduce operations or close down in order to improve production, improve management, and reduce costs, they may dismiss some or all workers after labor-management consultation and filing with the Labor Bureau.

In this way, the enthusiasm of the capital for operation has been improved, and labor-management relations have further moved towards normal.

(2) Adjust public-private relations.

In the commercial sector, the following issues are mainly resolved: First, adjust the scope of public and private operations and the proportion of operations. In order to stabilize prices and ensure the supply to citizens, we have developed retail stores in addition to developing cooperatives. This measure is very necessary. The disadvantage is that some retail stores sell too many types of goods. Therefore, we stopped the preparations for the establishment of two meat and food stores, and canceled three business offices of the retail company, and canceled the retail stores' concurrent operations of department stores and groceries (in the past, ten gauze retail stores concurrently operated department stores, and 28 grain retail stores concurrently operated groceries). Second, adjust prices to maintain an appropriate distance between wholesale and retail prices, and between regions, so that retailers and merchants from remote areas can obtain appropriate profits. Department stores have adjusted the prices of more than 100 major department stores, and the difference between wholesale and retail prices has been adjusted to 7% to 10%. It is profitable for private merchants to purchase goods from department stores, and the number of private merchants who have established business relationships with department stores has increased from 13 before the adjustment to 117. Third, mobilize public and private forces to organize urban-rural trade and accelerate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. To this end, a joint public-private Northwest Trade Delegation has been organized to go to the Chahar and Suiyuan regions to further understand the situation and establish a normal cooperative trade relationship between urban and rural areas.

In the industrial sector, state-owned enterprises mainly continue to vigorously support production by means of processing, ordering, purchasing, and consignment sales. From April to June, in the case of sluggish sales of goods, the quantity of yarn exchanged for cloth by the cotton yarn and cloth branch accounted for more than half of the total products of the weaving and dyeing industry; department stores purchased and exchanged products from various industries worth more than 10 billion yuan. The machinery, iron, and flour industries mainly process and order goods for the state. We are now coordinating with the various professional meetings convened by the central government to carry out production and sales plans, processing and ordering plans, and adjustments of processing fees. In addition, in order to appropriately unify and manage the production undertakings scattered among various agencies and troops, and coordinate them with state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, and handicrafts in terms of production plans, a special committee has been established to study the methods.

In terms of taxation, in order to take care of truly difficult industrial and commercial enterprises that are unable to pay taxes, the industrial and commercial tax arrears for the second half of 1949 have been reduced, exempted, or deferred according to the situation. A total of 2,555 industrial and commercial households have received this treatment, with a total reduction, exemption, and deferral of 2.9 billion yuan.

In terms of organizing the turnover of funds for industry and commerce, first, the state bank provides loans to support private factories with difficult capital turnover but with conditions to maintain, and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and the loan conditions are appropriately relaxed. From April to the end of July, a total of 17.7 billion yuan was loaned to private industry and commerce. Among them, 7 billion yuan was loaned out in July. Second, joint public-private bank loans have been organized, and their business is gradually expanding. At the same time, in order to concentrate idle funds into production, a joint public-private Xingye Investment Co., Ltd. was established.

In order to effectively implement the above measures, we have transferred cadres to form working groups with personnel dispatched by the trade union and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, focusing on selecting industries and households to deeply understand the situation, solve problems, and draw experience, and have achieved considerable results. At the same time, the Municipal Consultative Committee established three special groups for industry and commerce, labor and capital, and taxation in May to help carry out the work. Later, under the leadership of the Municipal People's Government, a committee for adjusting and handling industry and commerce was established to be responsible for this adjustment work.

Due to our correct implementation of a series of measures to adjust industry and commerce, coupled with the increase in rural purchasing power after the wheat harvest, most industries and businesses gradually improved in June. The volume of goods purchased and sold by commerce and the quantity of products produced and sold by industry have increased. In the past two months or so, urban-rural trade has greatly developed. Not only has the quantity and type of goods exchanged in the old trade relations increased, but also the goods that have not been circulated for many years due to the interruption of trade in remote areas have now begun to be exchanged.

With the stabilization of prices and the further development of urban-rural trade, farmers will have a large number of agricultural products to sell after the autumn harvest this year; at the same time, they also need to purchase a large number of industrial products. We must correctly estimate and adapt to this situation, and lead commercial idle funds to the countryside from all aspects to purchase agricultural products and promote industrial products.

Finally, we are willing to unite with all the workers and all the industrialists and businessmen in the city, and continue to work hard, "gradually eliminate the blindness and anarchy in the economy, rationally adjust the existing industry and commerce, and practically and properly improve public-private relations and labor-management relations" under the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration, overcome all difficulties, and strive for the rapid and normal development of the city's industry and commerce.

Third, regarding state-owned enterprises.

State-owned enterprises have made achievements in production. Among them, the achievements in public utilities are even more significant.

The trams have recently averaged 100 cars per day, and the interval between trams has been reduced to three and a half to seven minutes, restoring the ring road. In the first half of the year, the total number of vehicles, mileage, and passenger numbers completed the original plan. Looking at June, all exceeded the original plan. In terms of repair and manufacturing, it exceeded the plan by a lot. The original plan to complete 18 new locomotives by the end of August was completed ahead of schedule by the end of June. The number of overhauled locomotives exceeded the plan by 34% in the first half of the year, and the number of overhauled trailers exceeded the plan by 110%.

The population using tap water reached 920,000 in June, an increase of about 350,000 compared with last year. The plan to increase the population using tap water by 360,000 to 400,000 throughout the year has been basically completed in the first half of the year. In terms of installation, the expansion of main pipes exceeded the original semi-annual plan by 8%, and the expansion of branch pipes exceeded 12%.

Public buses have expanded seven routes in the urban area and five routes in the suburban area. Although the plan to operate 100 buses from May has not yet been completed, the average daily number of buses has increased from 35 in January to 78 now, and the average mileage per bus per day has increased by 44% compared with January.

In addition to public utilities, the larger state-owned enterprises under the city that are more closely related to the people's lives are the flour mill, Jingxi Coal Mine, and Qinghe Woolen Mill. These three units have basically completed the original semi-annual plan. Flour Mill No. 1 completed 111.8% of the plan; Flour Mill No. 2 completed 104.9% of the plan. Jingxi Coal Mine completed 94.7% of the plan (because of the flooding of the kiln, the output in May and June was reduced). Qinghe Woolen Mill completed 108% of the plan for blankets and 111.3% of the plan for carpet yarn.

The remaining smaller units have either exceeded the plan, such as Yanjing Paper Mill and Xinji Glass Factory, or failed to complete the plan due to poor sales, such as matches and kilns.

In terms of construction projects, Yanjing Paper Mill added two cooking machines and four pulping machines, and Xinji Flour Mill No. 1 installed 12 grinders, and Xinji Kiln Factory installed five brick making machines, all of which have been completed.

In terms of building new factories, Beijing Flour Company started construction of factory buildings in April, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Qinghe Woolen Mill has been approved by the central government to allocate 6,800 fine spinning spindles, which are now being inspected in Shanghai, and factory design is underway. Because of the surplus of carpet products, the carpet factory was changed to be attached to the carpet department of Qinghe Woolen Mill for small-scale production as a demonstration to improve the quality of carpets in the city. Since there are already private companies operating dyeing and ironing factories, the public will not add more.

We have repeatedly proposed a production competition campaign to improve quality and reduce costs. Since the city-wide workers' representative conference was held in February this year, the campaign has been launched one after another. Especially since May, the vast majority of state-owned enterprises have been involved in the production competition campaign and have achieved certain results in improving quality and reducing costs.

In terms of improving quality, let me give a few examples that are closest to us: the disinfection of tap water has made great progress compared with before. The number of bacteria inspections has increased from 20 times per month to 180 times, and the number of residual chlorine inspections has increased from 60 times per month to 180 times. For example, the industrial power supply voltage of the Electricity Bureau has been increased and is relatively stable. Generally, the difference from the voltage standard does not exceed 10%, which is of great benefit to industrial power. In the cotton weaving department of Qinghe Woolen Mill, there were many third-class cloths in the past, but now third-class cloths have been completely eliminated.

In terms of reducing costs, for example, the power generation cost of Shijingshan Power Plant was reduced by 47.1% per kilowatt-hour in June compared with January; the cost per kilometer of automobile was reduced by 36.4% in June compared with January; and the cost per ton of water of the Water Company was reduced by 16% in June compared with January.

The reason why the production of many of our enterprises can gradually improve quality and gradually reduce costs is because of reducing waste and implementing savings in manpower, fuel, electricity, time, raw materials, etc.; it is because of improving technology, improving labor organization, and rationalizing the production process, which has improved work efficiency; it is because of strengthening the safety system and reducing accidents. All of this is inseparable from the improvement of the status and awareness of the workers. In the production competition campaign, the workers, in addition to increasing labor intensity to improve work efficiency, also exerted their rich wisdom to improve technology and working methods. For example, Lu Yuntai and Deng Faxi of the Tram Company suggested installing water baffles, overcoming the difficulty of not being able to drive in rainy days for more than 20 years; Cao Xianbo of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant changed to using muffles as pipe washing knives, which increased work efficiency by 26 times at once; Zhu Lin of the Automobile Company created the "May 1st" gas stove, and technicians and workers of the Water Company jointly made leak detectors, which greatly helped to improve work efficiency.

In order to consolidate the workers' enthusiasm for production competition and implement the spirit of democratic management, we have reversed the thinking and problems of some administrative leaders who are reluctant to issue awards or do not issue awards in a timely manner. Only the tram, water, and bus companies have 1,226 people who have been rewarded. Collective contracts have been signed in many factories, and some have signed joint contracts. Factory management committees have been generally established. In the past, some factory management committees were only a formality and did not play a big role. They were rectified in May and June and have made progress compared with before.

However, there are still many problems in our production and production management.

First, there is the problem of high cost and low quality. Although there has been some progress compared with before, it is still far from our requirements. Some enterprises still have a lot of waste products, and waste is still very serious. If we do not make unremitting efforts, many of our industries will still not be able to develop. Second, the responsibility system is not sound, and there are still many accidents. In addition, the lack of planning has also caused a lot of production losses.

The most important problem in our production management is that, in addition to the fact that some enterprises are still not doing enough in relying on workers to implement democratic management and do not fully understand the significance of the production competition to improve quality and reduce costs, the failure to establish a good economic accounting system is also a common shortcoming. In the future, we should gradually establish an economic accounting system on the basis of further developing the production competition campaign.

Fourth, regarding financial and taxation work.

In terms of finance, the basic spirit of the 1950 revenue and expenditure budget approved by the last city people's representatives conference is: on the one hand, strive to ensure the completion of this year's work plan, and on the other hand, strive to basically achieve financial self-sufficiency, with Beijing's revenue for Beijing's expenditure. According to the implementation in the first half of the year, this plan can be completed.

As of the end of June, the actual income (including the industrial and commercial tax in the second half of last year, the agricultural tax last year, and the real estate tax in the winter of last year) was about 63.9% of the total annual income listed in the original budget. Among them, the tax revenue was 67.5% of the total annual tax revenue listed in the original budget; the profit of public enterprises was 13.1% of the total annual income listed in the original budget; and other income was 41.7% of the total annual income listed in the original budget. That is to say, the income has completed more than half of the annual budget, and the tax revenue has completed the largest proportion. The actual expenditure was about 53.79% of the total annual expenditure listed in the original budget. Among them, the operating expenses were about 57.24% of the total annual operating expenses listed in the original budget; the administrative expenses were about 43.64% of the total annual administrative expenses listed in the original budget; the financial expenses were about 28.48% of the total annual financial expenses listed in the original budget; and the reserve funds were about 45% of the total annual reserve funds, most of which were used for operating expenses. That is to say, in terms of actual expenditure, the proportion of operating expenses is larger, while the proportion of administrative expenses and financial expenses is smaller.

Second, there have also been some improvements in financial management. According to the central government's policy of unified financial management, we have specifically stipulated the management methods for various administrative and operating expenses, and formulated the general accounting system and the temporary regulations for the city treasury. However, the main shortcomings in the current financial work are still that the system is not sound enough and the audit work has not been seriously established, which has increased the difficulty in the implementation work. This should be continuously improved in the future.

In terms of taxation, it should be said that our work has been successful. Tax revenue accounts for about 94% of the financial revenue in the first half of this year. Because the tax work has completed the task, the supply of operating expenses has been guaranteed, and various construction projects have been gradually realized according to the plan. This is due to the support of the people of the city, especially the industrial and commercial circles, for the government in terms of paying taxes and the efforts of all tax workers.

However, there are shortcomings and errors in our tax work. On the one hand, some tax rates, tax items, and tax rules themselves contain shortcomings. On the other hand, there are errors in the implementation, such as: too many tax items, some are duplicated, some are unclear; the procedures are too cumbersome and there are errors; the tax calculation methods and valuations are not uniform; the payment deadline is sometimes too short, the most significant is that there are excessively light and heavy phenomena in the industrial and commercial tax, and there are still many cases of tax evasion. The central government has made adjustments and corrections to the tax rates, tax items, and tax rules themselves. We have been collecting taxes in accordance with the new regulations since July 1. The main ones are: (1) 353 kinds of goods tax have been stopped (238 kinds have been completely stopped, and 115 kinds have been partially stopped), 86 kinds have been merged, and 68 kinds have been reduced in tax rate; (2) The stamp tax has been reduced from 30 items to 25 items. Among them, the commercial certificate part, except for the delivery note which is calculated at a rate of 0.3%, the rest are affixed by the piece; (3) Although the income tax rate is stipulated as 5% to 30%, the starting point and the highest progressive point have been raised, and the progressive level has been increased from 14 levels to 20 levels, the progressive rate has been slowed down, and the level distance has been increased, so the actual tax rate is lighter than before; (4) The transaction tax is limited to exchanges and markets with brokers, and other seat merchants, cooperatives, and direct transactions are exempt; (5) In the special consumption behavior tax, the starting point of the banquet tax has been raised from 5,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan; the new starting point of the cold food tax is 10,000 yuan; the new regulation of the hotel tax is that only those with more than 30,000 yuan per room per day are taxed.

At the same time, the collection methods have also been improved. The main changes are that the industrial and commercial tax is collected by the following three methods: (1) "Self-declaration, check accounts, and calculate according to the rate." For industrial and commercial households with sound accounting systems that are sufficient to be used as tax basis, after applying for approval from the tax bureau, they can be collected according to this method. The business tax is changed from quarterly collection to monthly collection; the income tax is estimated and collected twice a year, and the final settlement is made at the end of the year, with more refunds and less supplements. (2) "Self-declaration, public discussion, and democratic evaluation." For industrial and commercial households that have books but the accounting system is not sound, the business tax and income tax are calculated separately. The business tax is "self-declared, publicly discussed, and democratically evaluated" and calculated according to the rate and paid monthly. The income tax will be collected separately by democratic evaluation or checking accounts in the future, and estimated and collected twice a year, with final settlement at the end of the year. (3) "Regular quota on the basis of self-declaration, public discussion, and democratic evaluation." For small industrial and commercial households with unsound books or even no books, after applying for approval from the tax bureau, the business tax and income tax are collected together. The amount of tax payable is fixed by self-declaration, democratic evaluation or consultation, and paid monthly. In the future, about 1,000 households in the city will adopt the first method, and about 30,000 households will adopt the third method. The sum of the two is about 31,000 households, and the remaining 8,9,000 households will adopt the second method, namely "self-declaration, public discussion, and democratic evaluation."

The collection procedures for goods tax have also been improved as follows: (1) For goods such as cement, flat glass, records, beer, wheat flour, cotton yarn, porcelain, canned food, and beverages, which are produced centrally and are not easy to evade taxes, after the tax is paid and the goods are released from the factory, no distribution license is required, and no distribution procedures are required; (2) To solve the difficulty of weaving and dyeing households (processing for cotton yarn and cloth companies) not having cash to pay taxes, after consultation with the cotton yarn and cloth companies, the company will submit the tax declaration and issue the license monthly; (3) In order to facilitate the transportation of goods, the verification and payment are done by the manufacturer, and the tax bureau personnel go to the factory or storage place to supervise the affixing, reducing the manufacturer's transportation costs and time consumption.

As for the style of commandism of a small number of tax work cadres, and the behavior of individual elements of corruption, we are seriously correcting them by strengthening education and checking discipline.

In terms of local surcharges, primary school education fees, sanitation fees, etc. originally belong to local expenses, which are raised by the local government. After the liberation of the city, the local administrative and business fees have been levied twice in the urban area. Because the old autonomous donation collection method was used, the households were apportioned, which was quite unreasonable. According to the resolution of the first session of the second city people's representatives conference, it was changed to the surcharge method to solve the problem. 30% of the real estate tax and land tax were surcharged, and 10% of the industrial and commercial tax was surcharged. Now, according to the decision of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, the local surcharges, except for the real estate tax and land tax, which are still surcharged by 30%, the industrial and commercial tax is no longer surcharged, but is changed to the surcharge of public utilities. The surcharge will be collected in the second half of this year according to the following methods: (1) 8% surcharge on electricity bills, estimated at about 300,000 catties of millet per month (because the road light fee has been surcharged by 5%, it should not be surcharged too much, and in order to take care of the industry and avoid increasing costs, the electricity fee will not be surcharged for the time being); (2) 10% surcharge on telephone monthly rent, estimated at about 220,000 catties of millet per month; (3) 10% surcharge on tap water fee, estimated at about 70,000 catties of millet per month; (4) 8% surcharge on tram fares, estimated at about 66,000 catties of millet per month (tram passengers are mostly workers, staff, and students, so the surcharge should not be too much); (5) 8% surcharge on bus fares, estimated at about 40,000 catties of millet per month (the bus business is still in the rectification period, and it is planned to postpone the implementation for the sake of taking care of it); the above five items are estimated to generate about 696,000 catties of millet per month. A total of 3.48 million catties of millet can be collected in five months from August, which may increase by hundreds of thousands of catties compared with the surcharge of the industrial and commercial tax in the original budget for the first half of the year (a total of 3.15 million catties of millet in urban and suburban areas). If there is any surplus in addition to the expenses listed in the original budget, it is planned to use it to expand primary schools and solve the problem of out-of-school children.

Finally, it should be pointed out that although our financial and taxation work has made considerable achievements, we still need to overcome many difficulties in order to ensure the thorough realization of this year's revenue and expenditure budget. We call on all organs and all state-owned enterprises in the city to continue to practice economy and save all possible expenses. State-owned enterprises should also improve management and strive to pay financial tasks. We call on all tax cadres to strictly abide by policies, correct their work style, be honest and upright, block loopholes, cooperate with the people, and strive to complete the annual tax plan. At the same time, we hope that the industrial and commercial circles of the city will, as in the past, support the government's tax policy, abide by the tax law, and actively pay taxes.

Fellow Representatives! The above is our report on financial and economic work. Please review and criticize the conference.

### 在京市二届三次各界人民代表会议上  张副市长关于财经工作的报告

1950-08-10
第5版()
专栏：

　　在京市二届三次各界人民代表会议上
    张副市长关于财经工作的报告各位代表：
    这个报告准备说明以下四个问题，就是：本年度生产方针和任务的执行情况，调整工商业，公营企业和财政税收工作。
    第一、关于本年度生产方针和任务的执行情况。
    在第二届第二次各界人民代表会议上，聂市长关于一九五○年度工作计划的报告，曾指出：今年的中心工作仍是恢复与发展生产，而为了恢复与发展生产，首先，就要致力于“提高质量，减低成本，增加产量，扩大销路”。特别是关于“提高质量，减低成本”，在历次各界人民代表会议的决议及市人民政府的报告和计划中，都着重指出：这是恢复与发展本市生产的关键。这一方针是正确的。本市生产由于一般工厂技术较差，设备不够，而经营管理上又有缺点，以致产品的质量低，成本高，如不改进，生产就不可能得到发展。另一方面，我们的生产必须面向广大人民，特别是广大农民，如果我们不能供给他们以质好价廉的货物，建立城乡互助关系，开辟广大市场，生产也就不可能得到发展。半年来私营企业的生产是有成绩的，大部分行业（如铁工、织染、染业、制革、面粉、针织、橡胶、植物油、砖窑等业），今年上半年的平均月产量都超过了一九四九年度平均月产量，并且有些行业（如针织、肥皂业中的大厂）的产品质量有了一定程度的提高，销路较好。公营企业的生产，也是有成绩的，主要企业都基本上完成了任务，后面将要说到，这里就不重复了。
    所谓恢复与发展生产，不应该是盲目的，而应该根据社会经济的发展，人民的需要和市场原料的状况，分别给公私企业以经营方向的指导，即有些行业应适当发展，有些行业应维持原有产量，有些行业应适当缩小生产，而一部分制造奢侈品、迷信品的行业，则应指导其转业。在生产方向指导上，过去我们曾做了一些工作，大体上是适当的。但是由于我们对全国市场不很了解，对本市产销情况也调查研究不够，因而有些行业如火柴等，本来已经过剩，我们没有及时予以指导，这是应该检讨的。由此，我们得到一个经验：就是在私营企业和小生产者还占优势的情况下，我们又缺乏精确的统计，要做一个包括公私营企业在内的生产计划，是不可能的，对私营企业给以大体的方向的指导是必要的，但也只能给以这样的指导。今年秋收后估计农村购买力将有所提高，下半年有些产品的销路可能增加，但有些产品可能仍然遭遇生产过剩的困难，因此，我们必须随时注意市场情况的变化，避免生产上的盲目性。
    第二、关于调整工商业。
    由于中央统一财经工作的决定在全国贯彻的结果，国家经济情况已开始好转，十二年来，通货膨胀，物价高涨的恶劣局面已经改变，本市物价从三月下旬起，开始下落，五月下旬以后，渐趋稳定。广大市民获得生活安定的利益，工商业也走向正常发展的前途。
    但是，在这一经济变化的过程中，工商业势不能不遭遇一些不可避免的、但是可以克服的暂时困难。私营商业三月下旬以后，歇业多于开业，开业和歇业的比例：四月份是一比三，五月二十日以前是一比二，五月下旬以后是一比一，六月份以来，则开业已稍多于歇业，并有四十余大商户撤销歇业申请。从三月到六月底，歇业共一千八百二十一户，开业共九百九十六户，开业为歇业的百分之五十四点六。歇业最多的是不适合于人民需要的，带投机性的或过剩的行业。工业虽也遭遇到困难，但较商业情况稍好。从三月到六月底，工业二十一个行业的统计，开业共八百二十六户，职工三千七百三十人，歇业共四百九十户，职工二千一百一十一人；二者相抵，实增三百三十六户，职工一千六百一十九人。
    为了克服工商业所遭遇的困难，我们曾经进行广泛而细密的调查研究工作，从四月份起，即根据中央调整工商业的精神，针对本市工商业的具体情况，并征求各有关方面的意见，先后采取了下列各项措施：
    （一）通过劳资协商，调整劳资关系，共同克服困难。
    首先，由市劳动局、市总工会号召建立劳资协商会议，积极改进生产，改善经营管理，有劳资纠纷的，加以妥善解决，现已建立的，有十三个行业和四十多家工厂、商号。
    对有益于国计民生，有发展前途，但暂时营业困难，甚至赔累的企业，准许暂时降低工资。例如经纬织布厂，降低了工资百分之十九至百分之三十九。有些工人、店员除资方供给伙食外，自动停领工资或缓领工资，有的暂时轮流回家，留职停薪，有的暂时降低了伙食。
    其次，是提高劳动纪律，提高工作效率，有的暂时增加工作时间以减低成本，提高产量。例如有些中药店前柜员工下班后，自动参加后柜制药工作。
    至于确实为了改进生产，改善经营，降低成本或必须缩小经营或歇业的，经过劳资协商，并向劳动局备案，得解雇一部或全部工人。
    这样，就提高了资方经营的积极性，并使劳资关系进一步走向正常。
    （二）调整公私关系。
    在商业方面，主要解决下列几个问题：第一，调整公私经营范围和经营比重。为了稳定物价，保障市民供应，我们除发展合作社外，并曾发展了零售店。这一措施是十分必要的。缺点是有些零售店卖货种类过多。因此，我们停止了筹设肉品、食品两个门市部，并取消了零售公司的三个营业处，撤消了零售店兼营百货和杂货业务（过去有十个纱布门市部兼营百货，二十八个粮食零售店兼营杂货）。第二，调整价格，使批发价与零售价之间，地区与地区之间的差价，保持适当距离，以便零售商和远地商能获得适当利润。百货公司对一百余种主要百货价格进行了调整，批发价和零售价的差额，已调整到百分之七到百分之十。私商从百货公司批货有利，与百货公司建立业务关系的私商，已从调整前的十三户增到一百一十七户。第三，动员公私力量组织城乡贸易，加速城乡物资交流，为此，已组织了公私联合的西北贸易访问团，前往察绥地区进一步了解情况，以建立正常的城乡互助的贸易关系。
    在工业方面，主要是国营企业继续用加工、定货、收购、代销的办法，大力扶植生产。从四月到六月，在商品滞销的情况下，花纱布分公司以纱换布的数量占织染业全部产品的一半以上；百货公司收购和交换各行业产品约值一百多亿元。机器、铁工、面粉业大部分是给国家加工、定货。现正配合中央陆续召开的各专业会议进行产销计划，加工、定货计划和加工费的调整。此外，为了把各机关部队分散经营的生产事业适当地统一起来，加以管理，使与国营企业、私营企业、手工业在生产计划上取得协调，现已成立一个专门委员会研究办法。
    在税收方面，为了照顾真正困难，无力完税的工商业，对他们所欠一九四九年度下半年的工商业税，已斟酌情况，分别减免或缓征。计有二千五百五十五家工商户得到这种待遇，共减、免、缓征二十九亿元。
    在组织工商业资金周转方面，首先，是国家银行对资金周转困难而有条件维持的私营工厂和有益于国计民生的商业，给以贷款扶植，并将贷款条件酌予放宽。从四月至七月底，对私营工商业贷款共为一百七十七亿元。其中，七月份即贷出七十亿元。其次，是举办了公私行庄联合贷款，现在正逐步扩大其业务。同时，为了集中游资投入生产，筹办了公私合营的兴业投资股份有限公司。
    为了有效地贯彻以上措施，我们曾抽调干部会同工会和工商联合会派出的人员组成工作组，有重点地选择行业、户，深入了解情况，解决问题，吸取经验，现已获得相当成绩。同时，市协商委员会于五月间成立了工商、劳资、税收三个专门小组帮助进行。后来，又在市人民政府的领导下，建立了工商业调整处理委员会负责这一调整工作。
    由于我们正确地实行了一系列调整工商业的措施，再加麦收后农村购买力提高，因而到六月份，大部分工商业逐步好转。商业的进销货额和工业的产销数量均有增加。最近两个多月的城乡贸易，大有开展，不仅旧有的贸易关系在物资交换的数量和种类上都有增加，而且因远地贸易多年断绝，互不流通的物资，现在也已开始交流了。
    随着物价稳定，城乡贸易进一步开展，今年秋收以后，农民将有大量农产品要求出售；同时，也需要购买大量工业品。我们必须正确地估计和适应这一情况，并从各方面领导商业游资下乡，收购农产品，推销工业品。
    最后，我们愿意与全市职工，全市工商业者团结一致，继续努力，“在统筹兼顾的方针下，逐步地消灭经济中的盲目性和无政府状态，合理地调整现有工商业，切实而妥善地改善公私关系和劳资关系”，克服一切困难，争取本市工商业迅速走向正常发展。
    第三、关于公营企业。
    公营企业的生产是有成绩的。其中，公用事业方面的成绩更为显著。
    电车最近每天平均出车已达百辆，行车间隔已经减为三分半到七分钟，恢复了环行路。半年总计：在出车辆数，行车公里，乘客人数方面都完成了原订的计划，如就六月份来看，则都超过了原订计划。在修造方面超过计划很多，原计划于八月底完成的十八辆新造机车已提前于六月底完成。大修机车半年中超过计划百分之三十四，大修拖车超过计划百分之一百一十。
    自来水的用水人口，六月份已达九十二万，比去年增加了约三十五万人，全年增加三十六至四十万用水人口的计划，半年已基本完成。在装设方面，干管扩充超过原订半年计划的百分之八，支管扩充超过百分之十二。
    公共汽车已经扩充城区七路，郊区五路。虽然还没有完成原订五月份起出车百辆的计划，但平均每日出车已由一月份的三十五辆增加到现在七十八辆，而每日每车的平均行车公里数则较一月份提高了百分之四十四。
    除公用事业外，市属公营企业中较大的关系人民生活较多的是面粉厂、京西煤矿和清河制呢厂，这三个单位都已基本上完成了原订半年的计划，计面粉一厂完成百分之一百一十一点八；二厂完成的百分之一百零四点九。京西煤矿完成了计划的百分之九十四点七（因为淹窑，五、六月份产量减低）。清河制呢厂毛毯完成计划的百分之一百零八，地毯纱完成计划的百分之一百一十一点三。
    其余较小的几个单位有的超过了计划，如燕京造纸厂、新建玻璃厂等，有的则因为销路不畅，未能完成计划，如火柴、窑业等。
    修建工程方面，燕京造纸厂增设蒸煮机两台，打浆机四台，新建面粉一厂安装机磨十二部，新建窑业厂安装制砖机五台，都已完成。
    建设新厂方面，北京面粉公司自四月份起，动工建筑厂房，预计年底可以完成。清河制呢厂经请准中央调拨精纺六千八百锭，现在已经在上海检修，并正进行建厂设计。地毯厂因产品过剩，改在清河制呢厂附设地毯部，进行小规模生产，作为示范，以提高本市地毯的质量。染烫厂因已有私人开办，公家即不增设。
    我们曾经屡次提出进行提高质量，减低成本的生产竞赛运动，从今年二月全市职工代表大会召开以来，这个运动即陆续展开，特别是从五月份以后，绝大多数的公营企业都已卷入生产竞赛运动，并在提高质量，减低成本方面获得了一定的成绩。
    在提高质量方面，试举几个与我们最切近的例子：自来水在消毒方面比以前有很大进步，细菌的检查，已从每月二十次增加到一百八十次，剩余氯的检查由每月六十次增加到一百八十次。又如电业局的工业用电电压已经提高，并已比较稳定，一般与电压标准相差不超过百分之十，这对于工业动力有极大的好处。清河制呢厂的棉织部，过去三等布很多，现在已经根本消灭了三等布。
    在减低成本方面，例如石景山电厂发电成本，六月份比一月份每度电减少了百分之四十七点一；汽车每车公里成本，六月份比一月份减少了百分之三十六点四；自来水公司每吨水的成本，六月份比一月份减少了百分之十六。
    我们的不少企业的生产，所以能够把质量逐渐提高，成本逐渐减低，是由于减少了浪费，实行了人力、燃料、电力、时间、原料等各方面的节约；是由于改进技术，改善劳动组织，生产过程的合理化等而提高了工作效率；是由于加强安全制度减少了事故。而所有这一切都是和职工的地位以及职工的觉悟提高分不开的。在生产竞赛运动当中，职工群众，不单是用增加劳动强度的方法来提高工作效率，而且发挥了他们丰富的智慧来改进技术和工作方法。例如电车公司卢运泰、邓发熙建议安装挡水板，克服了二十余年来雨天不能行车的困难；石景山钢铁厂曹宪波改用闷子作洗管刀，一下子就把工作效率提高了二十六倍；汽车公司朱临创造“五一”式煤气炉，自来水公司技师和工人合制听漏器等对于工作效率的提高，帮助都很大。
    我们为了巩固职工群众这种生产竞赛的热情，贯彻管理民主化的精神，已经扭转了某些行政领导人舍不得发奖，或不及时发奖的思想和毛病，仅电车、自来水、公共汽车三个公司，就有一千二百二十六个人已经得到了奖励，在很多厂子订立了集体合同，有的并订立了联系合同，普遍建立了工厂管理委员会。过去有些工厂管理委员会仅具形式，不大起作用，在五、六月间进行了整顿，较前已有进步。
    但是，我们在生产和生产管理方面，还存在着很多问题。
    首先，是成本高、质量低的问题，虽然比以前有了一些进步，但是距我们的要求还相差很远，有的企业废品仍很多，浪费现象还很严重，如果不作再接再厉的努力，我们的许多工业还是不能发展的。其次，是负责制度还不健全，事故还很多。此外，计划性的不足也造成了很多生产上的损失。
    在我们的生产管理当中最主要的问题，除了仍有一部分企业在依靠职工实行民主管理方面还做得不够，对提高质量，减低成本的生产竞赛的意义还认识不足外，还没有很好地建立起经济核算制也是一个普遍的缺点。今后应在进一步展开生产竞赛运动的基础上逐渐建立起经济核算制。
    第四、关于财政税收工作。
    在财政方面，上次市各界人民代表会议所通过的一九五○年度收支概算的基本精神是：一方面争取保证本年度工作计划的完成，另一方面争取基本上作到财政自给，以北京市收入，供北京市开支。根据上半年执行的情况看来，这个计划是可以完成的。
    截至六月底止，实际收入（包括去年下半年的工商税，去年的农业税和去年冬季的房产税等），约为原概算所列全年收入的百分之六十三点九。其中，税收部分为原概算所列全年税收的百分之六十七点五；公营事业赢利为原概算所列全年该项收入的百分之十三点一；其他各项收入为原概算所列全年各该项收入的百分之四十一点七。这就是说，收入已完成了全年概算的一半以上，而税收完成的比例最大。实际支出约为原概算所列全年支出的百分之五十三点七九。其中，事业费约为原概算所列全年事业费的百分之五十七点二四；行政费约为原概算所列全年行政费的百分之四十三点六四；财务费约为原概算所列全年财务费的百分之二十八点四八；预备费约为原概算所列全年预备费的百分之四十五，而其中大部分是用作事业费。这就是说，实际支出方面，事业费所占比例较大，而行政费和财务费所占比例都较小。
    其次，财政管理工作，也有了一些改进。根据中央统一财政管理的方针，我们具体规定了各项行政费、事业费的管理办法，制定了总会计制度和市金库暂行规程。但目前财政工作上的主要缺点，仍然是制度不够健全，审计工作没有认真建立起来，因而便增加了执行工作中的困难，这是今后应该继续改进的。
    在税收方面，应该说我们的工作是有成绩的。在这半年的财政收入当中，税收约占百分之九十四。由于税收工作完成了任务，才使事业费的供给得到保证，才使各项建设事业得以按照计划逐步实现。这是由于全市人民特别是工商业界在纳税方面对于政府的支持和全体税收工作人员的努力。
    但是，在我们的税收工作当中，是有缺点和错误的。一方面，是有些税率、税目、税则本身就包含着缺点。他方面，则是执行中所犯的错误，例如：税目太多，有的重复，有的不明确；手续太繁，并有错误；计税方法和估价不统一；缴纳限期有时规定得太短，最显著的是工商业税有畸轻畸重的现象，而逃税漏税的情况也还不少。属于税率、税目、税则本身的，中央已做了调整与修正。我们从七月一日起，即已按照新的规定征税。其中主要的是：（１）货物税停止征收的三百五十三种（全部停征二百三十八种，一部停征一百一十五种），合并征收的八十六种减低税率的六十八种；（２）印花税由三十目减为二十五目，其中，商业凭证部分，除发货票依率按千分之三计征外，余均按件贴花；（３）所得税税率虽规定为百分之五至百分之三十，但起征点和最高累进点都已提高，并将累进等级由十四级增加为二十级，累进放缓，级距增加，因而实际上税率较以前减轻；（４）交易税只限于交易所和有牙纪的集市，其他座商、合作社和直接成交的都免征；（５）特种消费行为税中的筵席税，起征点由五千元提高为五万元；冷食税新定起征点为一万元；旅店税新定每日每房间三万元以上的才征税。
    同时，征收方法也有改进，主要是工商业税改由以下三种方法征收：（１）“自报查账，依率计征。”凡工商业户会计制度健全足资为征税确据的，经申报税局核准后，可按这种办法征收，营业税由按季征收改为按月征收；所得税半年估征一次，年终结算，多退少补。（２）“自报公议，民主评定”，凡虽有账簿，但会计制度还不健全的工商业户，采营业税和所得税分别计征办法，营业税是“自报公议，民主评定”，依率计征，按月缴纳。所得税将来分别采民主评议或查账计征，半年估征一次，年终结算。（３）“在自报公议，民主评定基础上的定期定额”，凡账簿不健全甚至没有账簿的小工商业户，经申报税局核准后，营业税、所得税合并征收，由各户自报，经民主评定或协商，固定应纳税额，按月缴纳。今后本市采用第一种方法的将约有一千户，采用第三种方法的约三万户，二者合计约三万一千户，其余八、九千户则采用第二种方法，即“自报公议，民主评定”。
    货物税的征收手续也作了以下的改进：（１）凡水泥、平板玻璃、唱片、啤酒、麦粉、棉纱、磁器、罐头、饮料等集中生产，不易漏税的货品，完税出厂后，不再领分运照，不再办分运手续；（２）解决织染业户（给花纱布公司加工）无现款纳税的困难，经与花纱布公司协商，由该公司每月汇总申报纳税，贴证发照；（３）为了便利货物运输，将查验证交厂商自贴，税局人员到工厂或存货处监贴，减少厂商的运费和时间的消耗。
    至于少数税务工作干部，强迫命令的作风，以及个别分子贪污腐化的行为，我们正在用加强教育、检查纪律等方法，认真纠正中。
    在地方附加方面，小学教育费，清洁卫生费等原属地方性开支，由地方筹措。本市解放后，曾在城区征收过两次地方行政事业费，因系沿用旧自治捐征收办法，逐户摊派，颇不合理。经本市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议决议，改用附征方法解决，房产税、地产税附征百分之三十，工商业税附征百分之十。现在，根据中央财经委员会决定，地方附加除房产税、地产税仍附征百分之三十外，工商业税不再附加，而改由公用事业附征。本年下半年度拟按下列办法征收：（１）电灯费附征百分之八，每月预计约三十万斤小米（因路灯费已附征百分之五，故不宜附征过多，又为了照顾工业，免致增加成本，电力费暂不附征）；（２）电话月租附征百分之十，每月预计约二十二万斤小米；（３）自来水费附征百分之十，每月预计约七万斤小米；（４）电车票价附征百分之八，每月预计约六万六千斤小米（电车乘客多为工人、职员、学生，故附征不宜过多）；（５）公共汽车票价附征百分之八，每月预计约四万斤小米（目前公共汽车营业尚在整顿时期，为照顾起见，拟暂缓实行）；上列五项，每月预计收入约六十九万六千斤小米。从八月份起五个月共可收三百四十八万斤小米，较原概算所列半年工商业税附加（城区郊区合计三百一十五万斤小米），可能增加几十万斤，供原概算所列开支外，如尚有余款，拟用以扩充小学，多解决一些儿童失学问题。
    最后，应该指出：我们的财政税收工作虽已有相当成绩，但为了保证本年度收支概算的彻底实现，还需要克服许多困难。我们号召全市各机关，各公营企业继续厉行节约，节省一切可能节省的开支。公营企业并应改善经营，争取缴纳财政任务。我们号召全体税务工作干部严守政策，端正作风，廉洁奉公，堵塞偷漏，与人民合作，为完成全年税收计划而努力。同时，我们希望本市工商业界一本过去支持政府税收政策的精神，遵照税章，踊跃纳税。
    各位代表！以上是我们关于财经工作的报告，请大会审查和批评。
