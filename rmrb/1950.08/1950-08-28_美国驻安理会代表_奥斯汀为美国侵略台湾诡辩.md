　　Xinhua News Agency, 27th Dispatch: After our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council requesting sanctions against the United States for its aggression against our territory of Taiwan and taking measures to make the U.S. government completely withdraw its armed aggressive forces from Taiwan and other Chinese territories, the U.S. representative to the Security Council, Austin, sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 25th, defending the U.S. act of aggression against Taiwan. In the letter, Austin quoted U.S. President Truman's statement on the Taiwan issue on July 19, listing a large number of reasons in an attempt to prove that "the United States has not committed aggression against Chinese territory."
    Austin said: "The actions of the United States have been clearly stated and do not hinder the political resolution of the future status of Taiwan. The actual status of the island is that it is a territory received from Japan as a result of the Allied victory in the Pacific. Like other such regions, its legal status cannot be determined until international action is taken to decide its future. The Chinese government accepted the surrender of the Japanese army on the island at the request of the Allied nations, which is why the Chinese are there now." Here, Austin revealed the despicable and rogue nature of the U.S. government, which attempts to deny that Taiwan has long been Chinese territory, overturn international agreements signed by the U.S. President, and completely tear up U.S. President Truman's statement of January 5 this year that Taiwan belongs to China and that the United States will never interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. In that statement, Truman said: "In the Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, the U.S. President, the British Prime Minister, and the Chinese Chairman stated that their purpose was: the territories Japan had stolen from China, such as Taiwan, should be returned to China. The United States is a signatory to the Potsdam Declaration of July 26, 1945. The Potsdam Declaration stated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration should be enforced. Japan also accepted the provisions of this declaration upon surrender. To implement the above declarations, Taiwan was handed over to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. For the past four years and other Allied nations have also recognized that China has the right to exercise power over the island, and the United States has never had any ambition to plunder Taiwan or other Chinese territories. The United States has no intention of acquiring special rights or privileges or establishing military bases in Taiwan now." Taiwan belongs to Chinese territory, which can never be denied by Austin's empty words, nor does it require any "international action to determine its future." The Chinese people have lived there for thousands of years, and it is by no means, as Austin said, that they only began to live there after the Kuomintang reactionary government went there to accept the surrender of the Japanese army.
    Austin said: "The United States has not committed aggression against Chinese territory, nor has it taken any aggressive action against China." However, it is well known that the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the Thirteenth Air Force have bases in Taiwan, Truman ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and the fleet has been patrolling the Taiwan Strait, which belongs to China. Various U.S. ships and aircraft have arrived at ports and airports in Taiwan Province, China.
    Austin said: "The U.S. action regarding Taiwan was taken when the island was a site of conflict with the mainland. The public declarations of the CCP authorities make the outbreak of more serious conflict imminent. This conflict will threaten the safety of the United Nations forces fighting pursuant to the Security Council's order to repel aggression against the Republic of Korea. They make the conflict likely to expand to the Pacific region." However, it is well known that Taiwan is Chinese territory, and it is a matter of course for the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the remnants of the Kuomintang bandit gang who fled there from the Chinese mainland, just as the American people in the Lincoln era waged years of war to liberate the southern black slaves and unify North and South America. The United States has absolutely no reason to send armed forces to invade our territory, territorial waters, and airspace because of this, just as foreign countries at that time had no reason to send troops to the United States to help the southern slave owners, because this is entirely a country's internal affair. As for the so-called "threatening the safety of the United Nations forces fighting pursuant to the Security Council's order to repel aggression against the Republic of Korea," it is the most shameless excuse. This is not only because this order of the Security Council is completely illegal, but also because Truman ordered the U.S. Seventh Fleet to guard Taiwan before the Security Council illegally passed this so-called "order."
    Austin said: "The actions of the United States are actions to neutralize Taiwan. Its purpose is to maintain peace and is therefore fully in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. As President Truman solemnly declared, we have no ambitions for Taiwan, and our actions are not motivated by a desire to obtain a special position for the United States." This is a clumsy sophistry. Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory, and the United States or any country has no right to "neutralize" it. In fact, the United States has a military mission stationed there that controls everything, and there are air and naval forces stationed there, which gives the United States a "special position" there and turns Taiwan into a U.S. base of aggression. This is not "maintaining peace," but means the armed aggression of the United States against China's territorial sovereignty and the destruction of the United Nations Charter.

### 美国驻安理会代表  奥斯汀为美国侵略台湾诡辩

　　美国驻安理会代表
    奥斯汀为美国侵略台湾诡辩
    【新华社二十七日讯】在我国周恩来外长致电联合国安全理事会要求制裁美国侵略我国领土台湾并采取措施使美国政府自台湾及其他中国领土完全撤出它的武装侵略部队后，美国驻安全理事会代表奥斯汀于二十五日致函联合国秘书长赖伊，为美国侵略台湾的行为辩护。奥斯汀在信中援引了美国总统杜鲁门七月十九日关于台湾问题的声明后，列举了一大堆理由，企图证明“美国并未侵犯中国领土”。
    奥斯汀说：“美国的行动业经明白说明，对于将来的台湾地位的政治解决并无妨碍。该岛实际地位，是它是一块由于盟军在太平洋的胜利而从日本手里接收过来的领土。像其他这样的地域一样，它的合法地位，在国际上采取行动决定它的前途之前，是不能确定的。中国政府在盟国要求下接受了该岛日本军队的投降，这就是中国人现在那里的原因。”奥斯汀在这里表明了美国政府的卑鄙和无赖，它企图否认台湾早已是中国的领土，推翻有美国总统签字的国际协定，并完全撕毁美国总统杜鲁门今年一月五日关于台湾已属中国和美国决不干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明。杜鲁门在那一声明中说：“在一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言中美国总统、英国首相及中国主席曾声明他们的目的是：日本自中国夺去的领土如台湾应当归还中国。美国是一九四五年七月二十六日波茨坦宣言的签字国。波茨坦宣言称，开罗宣言条款应予执行。日本于投降时亦曾接受此宣言的规定。为实践以上各项宣言，台湾即交给蒋介石委员长。过去四年来及其他盟国亦承认中国得对该岛行使权力，美国对台湾或中国其他领土从无掠夺的野心。现在美国亦无意在台湾获取特别权益或特权或建立军事基地。”台湾属于中国领土，决不是奥斯汀一纸空文所能否认的，也无须什么“国际上采取行动决定它的前途”。中国人在那里居住已有数千年，决非如奥斯汀所说的是在国民党反动政府到那里接收日军投降以后才开始。
    奥斯汀说：“美国并未侵犯中国领土，也未对中国采取侵略行动。”但是，尽人皆知，美国的第七舰队和第十三航空队都在台湾保有基地，杜鲁门曾命令美国第七舰队阻止中国人民解放台湾，该舰队已在属于中国的台湾海峡上巡逻，美国的各种舰只和飞机已经到达中国台湾省的港口和机场。
    奥斯汀说：“美国关于台湾的行动是当该岛是与大陆冲突的地点时采取的。中共当局的公开宣言使更严重的冲突有爆发之势。此种冲突将威胁奉安理会关于击退对大韩民国的侵略的命令而作战的联合国部队的安全。它们使冲突有扩大至太平洋地区之势。”但是，尽人皆知，台湾是中国的领土，中国人民要解放台湾，要肃清自我国大陆逃到那里去的国民党残余匪帮，是天经地义的事，正如林肯时代的美国人民为解放南方黑奴和统一南北美而进行了多年的战争一样。美国完全没有任何理由因此而派遣武装部队侵入我国领土、领海和领空，也正如当时的外国没有任何理由派兵到美国帮助南方的奴隶主一样，因为这完全是一国的内政。至于所谓“威胁奉安理会关于击退对大韩民国的侵略的命令而作战的联合国部队的安全”，更是最无耻的借口，这不仅因为安理会这一命令是完全非法的，而且杜鲁门下令美国第七舰队守卫台湾是在安理会非法通过这一所谓“命令”之前。
    奥斯汀说：“美国的行动是使台湾中立的行动。它的目的在保持和平，因此完全符合联合国宪章的精神。诚如杜鲁门总统所郑重宣布的，我们对台湾并无野心，我们的行动不是出于希望为美国获得特殊地位。”这是拙劣的诡辩。台湾是中国领土的一部分，美国或任何国家均无权使之“中立”。事实上，美国在那里驻有控制一切的军事使团，驻有空军和海军，这就使美国在那里“获得特殊地位”，使台湾变为美国的侵略基地。这不是“保持和平”，而是意味着美国对于中国领土主权的武装侵略和对于联合国宪章的破坏。
