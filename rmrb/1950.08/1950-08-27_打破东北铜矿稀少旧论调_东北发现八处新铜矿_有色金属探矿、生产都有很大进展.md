　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 24th. The achievements of non-ferrous metal industrial prospecting work in the Northeast have refuted the past argument that the Northeast is scarce in copper resources, and provided new prospects for the development of the non-ferrous metal industry in the Northeast. In the past six months, eight new copper mines, one tungsten mine with abundant reserves, and one nickel mine have been discovered one after another. Among the new copper mines, five have been fully explored, and the reserves of copper ore have been determined to be approximately several million tons. At present, there are thirteen non-ferrous metal mines in the entire Northeast that are engaged in regular production, including copper, lead, molybdenum, and gold mines. These were restored and rebuilt by the People's Government from the ruins of Japanese equipment that was originally extremely rudimentary and then lost 80% of its mining equipment around August 15th. In the first half of this year, various mines have been committed to maximizing equipment efficiency and improving production efficiency, with remarkable results. Taking copper mines as an example, calculated by the amount of pure copper contained in the produced ore, the output in the first half of this year was 35% more than the entire year of 1949, and the ore dressing capacity also exceeded that of the Puppet Manchuria period by about two-fifths.

Note: Various non-ferrous metals are extremely valuable raw materials in modern industry. For example, adding 8% to 9% of tungsten during steelmaking can create very hard tungsten steel. If the steel contains 15% to 20% tungsten and 4% to 5% molybdenum or chromium, high-speed steel can be made, which is resistant to oxidation, acid erosion, rust, and friction, and has a very wide range of uses. The Northeast Non-Ferrous Metal Administration is now systematically developing underground treasures to gradually supply the needs of economic construction development.

　　打破东北铜矿稀少旧论调
    东北发现八处新铜矿
    有色金属探矿、生产都有很大进展
    【新华社沈阳二十四日电】东北有色金属工业探矿工作的成就，否定了过去认为东北铜矿资源稀少的论调，给东北有色金属工业的发展提供了新的远景。半年来已有新铜矿八处，藏量丰富的钨矿和镍矿各一处先后被探出。新铜矿中，五处已探查完毕，确定铜矿石的蕴藏量约有数百万吨。目前，全东北共有铜、铅、钼、金等十三个从事正规生产的有色金属矿山。这是人民政府在日寇设备原极简陋而于“八一五”前后矿山设备又损失百分之八十的废墟上恢复和重建起来的。今年上半年各矿致力于设备效能的发挥和生产效率的提高，收效显著。以铜矿为例，按所产矿石含纯铜数量计算，今年上半年的产量比一九四九年全年还多百分之三十五，选矿能力也超过伪满时期约五分之二。
    按：各种有色金属，均为近代化工业中极珍贵的原料和材料，如炼钢时加入百分之八至九的钨，即可做成很硬的钨钢。如使钢中含百分之十五至二十的钨和百分之四至五的钼或铭，则可做成高速度钢，不受氧化作用，不受酸的浸蚀，不生锈，不怕摩擦，用途甚为广泛。现东北有色金属管理局正有计划地开发地下宝藏，以逐渐供应经济建设发展的需要。
