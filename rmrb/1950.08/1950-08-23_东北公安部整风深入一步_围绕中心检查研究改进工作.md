　　Northeast Public Security Department's Rectification Deepens
　　Centered on Inspecting, Studying, and Improving Work

　　[By Our Newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily, there are two aspects to the rectification within the Northeast People's Government Public Security Department. On one hand, the leadership of the department has a clear understanding of the purpose and focus of the rectification. Cadres at the level of section chiefs and above consistently centered on inspecting work and studying improvement methods, ensuring the basically normal development of the rectification movement within the department. On the other hand, when some units in the department mobilized general cadres to inspect work, they deviated from the central task inspection due to aimless "free promotion of democracy," causing the rectification movement to take some detours. Both of these experiences are worth noting by various localities.

　　The leadership correctly grasped the direction of the rectification, and the main cadres, centering on inspecting work and studying the source of bureaucratism, began to find ways to correct it.

　　At the beginning of the rectification, Comrade Wang Jinxiang, the Minister of the Public Security Department, convened a meeting of Party member cadres at the level of section chief and above to conduct research. He clearly stated that the Northeast public security departments should focus on resolving four issues during the rectification: (1) Correctly implement the anti-espionage policy and overcome policy violations by certain public security organs and personnel; (2) Improve investigation and research work; (3) Implement economic protection work centered on industry and mining; (4) Thoroughly overcome the authoritarian thinking of public security personnel, as well as coercive orders and a work style that is detached from the masses. In light of the actual situation, Comrade Wang Jinxiang pointed out that the focus of the rectification in the public security departments should be on overcoming bureaucratism in leading organs above the provincial and municipal levels, overcoming bureaucratism and policy violations in counties and cities, and focusing on overcoming the work style of detachment from the masses among general public security personnel. The steps for rectification were from top to bottom, first solving the bureaucratism of the leading organs, then going down separately to help with the rectification, inspecting work, and discovering shortcomings in the leadership work from below, so as to improve work and implement policies.

　　During the rectification, the main cadres at the level of section and division chiefs grasped this center,展开展开 inspection work and research work, and proposed some improvement measures. From the inspection work, everyone realized that one of the manifestations of bureaucratism in the leadership of the public security departments in the past was the failure to promptly inspect work and summarize typical experiences to promote work. When people were sent down to inspect, their methods also had many problems: one was to only talk to responsible cadres in counties and cities, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete information. Relying on such inspections to analyze situations and solve problems would naturally lead to deviations. Another was a comprehensive "full-scale" inspection that did not grasp the key points. After a few days down there, everything had to be checked, but nothing was checked in depth. Still another was blindly going down to inspect work, dealing with trivial matters, and bringing back a pile of materials from the puppet Manchurian period until now, but it was not clear what problems they wanted to understand or what problems they wanted to solve. After analysis and research, everyone believed that the methods of inspection should be improved in the future. Each time, only one or two main issues should be inspected, from the provincial and municipal leading organs all the way to the lowest level, as well as the surrounding circumstances related to the work. After truly discovering the problems, researching and analyzing them, proposing specific measures, and helping the local areas improve their work, they should also inform all localities and require them to conduct a general inspection and improvement of the issue, and then conduct spot checks with emphasis. In this way, on the one hand, it is possible to understand the implementation of policies and decisions, and use typical examples to promote overall work, and on the other hand, it is possible to urge lower-level organs to strictly implement resolutions and correct the bad habit of not carefully studying policies and instructions.

　　Everyone checked out another manifestation of bureaucratic style: that provinces and cities copied and forwarded the instructions of the Public Security Department to lower levels, while giving few specific instructions based on local conditions; there were many tasks but few methods; and there were many meetings but few problems were solved. The inspection and assistance from the Public Security Department were also insufficient. Everyone proposed that in the future, in addition to writing the instructions of the department in a more accessible and specific way, the main thing should be to strengthen the professional and policy education of cadres. Specialized business meetings should be held more often at the provincial and municipal levels. The leadership should fully prepare in advance, collect materials, analyze the situation, summarize experience, and propose systematic and concrete solutions; each meeting should only deploy one or two tasks and thoroughly solve one or two problems. In this way, the work is easier to implement, and general cadres can also receive specific education and assistance. For general public security personnel, everyone believed that the past method of relying on public security schools for longer-term training could not solve the general problems in a timely manner. In the future, it is necessary to continue to adopt the method of short-term rotational training, collecting materials in advance, fully preparing, and then holding large classes, organizing discussions, inspecting and summarizing work,展开展开 criticism and self-criticism, and commending the good and criticizing the bad. Repeatedly conducting rotational training in this way, in coordination with resident meetings and mobilizing the masses to supervise, can gradually correct the work style of public security personnel being detached from the masses.

　　Everyone believed that going deep into the lower levels to inspect work, holding various business meetings, and systematically rotating public security personnel for training, coupled with improving investigation and research work, could gradually improve the leadership style and improve work efficiency. This is the initial gain of the rectification of the main cadres of the department.

　　Certain units had deviations in their inspection work.

　　On the other hand: certain units in the department had deviations in their inspection work. The leadership of the department adopted the method of freely promoting democracy among the general cadres in the organs, which was originally needed, but some units failed to grasp the purpose of promoting democracy and the central issues of the rectification, resulting in deviations, which caused the rectification movement to stagnate and not be able to deepen. For example, many of the opinions raised by everyone were about personal life, treatment, and other trivial issues. In the opinions on work, most were about the daily problems within the organs, and few touched on policy issues and the main issues of the leadership of the Public Security Department. At the same time, some cadres also had incorrect views on rectification. The most common was that they felt that all the opinions had been raised, and they were waiting for the leadership to solve the problems, believing that to make the rectification go deeper and find ways to solve the problems, they could only rely on leading cadres. Some believed that if they raised an opinion, the leadership had to solve it immediately, otherwise the leadership "had no spirit of self-criticism," and "raising it was as good as not raising it," losing confidence in improving work. Others were afraid of raising the wrong opinions, fearing that the leadership would "rectify" them. The leading cadres of some units were not specific in leading the rectification, and although they managed to discover and raise problems at the beginning, they failed to conduct serious research and propose concrete plans to guide everyone forward when they needed to go deeper to solve problems based on the specific circumstances of their units. Some leading comrades did not give positive explanations and criticisms of the incorrect opinions raised from below, fearing that they would commit the suspicion of "suppressing democracy," making right and wrong unclear and preventing the truth from being upheld.

　　In order to correct these deviations, the department, after research by the main cadres, held a forum for cadres and activists, where Comrade Wang Jinxiang made a report, analyzing the reasons why the rectification in some units had not deepened and the movement had stagnated. He pointed out that in the future, it is necessary to: 1. Freely promote democracy with leadership. Without promoting democracy, the movement cannot go deeper; but abandoning or relaxing leadership will easily cause the movement to lose its direction. 2. Adhere to the truth, criticize errors, distinguish right from wrong, and never blindly follow the crowd. Self-criticism should be combined with mutual criticism, and the view that mutual criticism is the suppression of democracy is wrong. Rectification is an ideological struggle, and it is necessary to promote the spirit of being responsible to the people, not to be discouraged by grievances, and not to be arrogant in times of success. 3. Combine the inspection of leaders, the inspection of the lower levels, and the inspection of oneself, and at the same time, conduct inspections on the main tasks. 4. Combine finding problems with solving problems. Solve what can be solved immediately; explain what cannot be solved clearly; and study ways to solve what needs to be solved in the future. 5. Each department should absorb activists with analytical ability to establish the leading core of each department, study the situation, raise questions, and展开展开 discussions.

　　After this forum, the deviations in the rectification of the department have been reversed, and all departments have now entered the stage of studying how to solve the problems in a concrete way.

　　东北公安部整风深入一步
    围绕中心检查研究改进工作
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：东北人民政府公安部的整风，有两方面的情形。一方面该部领导上对整风的目的和重点的认识是明确的，处、科长以上干部始终围绕中心，检查工作和研究改进办法，保证了该部整风运动基本上的正常发展。另一方面，该部某些单位在发动一般干部检查工作时，因为无目的地“放手发扬民主”，脱离了中心工作的检查，使整风运动走了一些弯路。这两方面的经验，都值得引起各地注意。
   领导上正确掌握整风方向，主要干部围绕中心检查工作，研究官僚主义来源，开始找出纠正办法。
    该部在整风开始时，部长汪金祥同志即召集该部处长以上党员干部进行研究，明确提出东北公安部门在整风中应着重解决四个问题：（一）正确地贯彻反奸政策，克服某些公安机关与人员违犯政策的行为；（二）改善调查研究工作；（三）贯彻以工矿为中心的经济保卫工作；（四）彻底克服公安人员的权威思想和强迫命令、脱离群众的作风。针对实际情况，汪金祥同志指出：公安部门的整风重点，在省市以上领导机关是克服官僚主义，在各县市是克服官僚主义和违犯政策的错误，而一般公安人员则着重于克服脱离群众的作风。整风的步骤是自上而下，首先解决领导机关的官僚主义；然后分头下去帮助整风，检查工作，并从下面发现领导工作中的缺点，借以改进工作，贯彻政策。
    在整风中，处、科长以上主要干部即抓住这一中心，展开检查工作和研究工作，提出了一些改进办法。从检查工作中，大家认识到过去公安部门领导上的官僚主义表现之一是没有及时检查工作和总结典型经验来推动工作。派人下去检查时，其方法也有许多毛病：一种是只和县、市负责干部谈谈，所得情况有不确实或不全面的缺点。靠这样的检查来分析情况、解决问题，自然要出偏差。另一种是包罗万象的“全面”检查，没有抓住重点。下去几天，什么都要检查，但什么都检查得不深入。还有一种是盲目地下去检查工作，琐琐碎碎，带回来从伪满时期直到现在的一大堆材料，但究竟要了解什么问题，解决什么问题，连自己也不太清楚。大家分析研究之后，认为今后检查工作的方法要加以改进。一次只检查一个或两个主要问题，从省市领导机关一直检查到最下层以及与工作有关联的周围情况。真正发现问题，研究分析之后，提出具体办法，帮助当地改进工作；同时通报各地，要求对这一问题作普遍的检查与改进，然后再有重点地进行抽查。这样，一方面可以了解政策和决定的贯彻情形，利用典型来推动全面工作，一方面又可以督促下级机关严格执行决议，纠正不仔细研究政策与指示的不良风气。
    大家检查出官僚主义作风的另一表现，是各省市对公安部指示向下边照抄照转的多，而根据当地情况具体指示的少；任务多，办法少；会议多而解决问题少。公安部的检查和帮助也不够。大家提出今后除了把部的指示写得更通俗、具体外，主要应加强干部的业务、政策教育。对省市一级应多召开专门业务会议。领导上事先要充分准备，搜集材料，分析情况，总结经验，提出系统的具体的解决办法；一次会只布置一件或两件任务，透彻地解决一个或两个问题。这样，工作既易于贯彻，一般干部也可以得到具体的教育和帮助。对一般公安人员，大家认为过去依靠公安学校进行较长期训练的办法，不可能及时解决带有普遍性的问题。今后要继续采取短期轮训办法，事先搜集材料，充分准备，然后上大课，组织讨论，检查、总结工作，展开批评与自我批评，表扬好的、批评坏的。这样反复进行轮训，配合居民会议，发动群众监督，便可逐渐纠正公安人员脱离群众的工作作风。
    大家认为深入下层检查工作、开好各种业务会议、系统地轮训公安人员，再加上改善调查研究工作，就可以逐步改进领导作风，提高工作效能。这是该部主要干部整风的初步收获。
    某些单位在检查工作中曾发生偏差。
    另一方面：该部某些单位在检查工作中曾发生偏向。该部领导上对机关中一般干部，采取了放手发扬民主的方法，这本来是需要的，但某些单位未能掌握发扬民主的目的与整风的中心问题，因而发生了偏差，使整风运动一度陷于停顿，不能深入下去。例如大家提的意见中，有不少是关于个人生活、待遇等枝节问题。在对工作的意见里，也是关于机关内部日常问题的居多，接触到政策问题和公安部领导上的主要问题的少。同时有些干部还对整风有不正确的看法。最普遍的是觉得意见都提了，等着上边解决问题，认为要使整风深入一步，找出解决问题的方法，只有依靠领导干部。有的认为自己提一个意见，领导上就得立刻解决一个，否则就是领导上“没有自我批评精神”，“提了等于白提”，对改进工作失去了信心。还有人怕提错了意见，怕领导上“整”自己。某些单位的领导干部，对整风领导不具体，虽然开始时做到了发现问题、提出问题，但到需要深入一步解决问题的时候，却未能根据本单位具体情况，认真研究，提出具体方案，引导大家前进。某些领导同志对下边所提不正确的意见没有作正面的解释和批判，怕犯“压制民主”的嫌疑，使得是非不清，真理不能坚持。
    为了纠正这些偏向，该部经过主要干部研究后，召开了干部和积极分子座谈会，由汪金祥同志作了报告，分析了某些单位整风没有深入、运动陷于停顿的原因。指出今后必须：一、有领导地放手发扬民主。不发扬民主，运动不能深入；但放弃或放松领导，运动就容易迷失方向。二、要坚持真理，批判错误，分清是非，绝不能盲目随声附和。自我批评要与相互批评结合，认为相互批评是压制民主的观点是错误的。整风是一个思想斗争，必须发扬为人民负责的精神，受委屈不气馁，顺利时不骄傲。三、要把检查领导、检查下面和检查自己结合起来，同时必须在主要工作上进行检查。四、发现问题与解决问题相结合。能解决的立即解决；不能解决的要解释清楚；需要在以后解决的也要研究出解决办法。五、各处要吸收有分析能力的积极分子建立各处的领导核心，研究情况，提出问题，展开讨论。
    经过这次座谈以后，该部整风偏向已扭转过来，现各处均已进入研究如何具体解决问题的阶段。
