Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: A comprehensive dispatch from TASS reports. On July 30th, the Soviet people widely celebrated Soviet Railway Workers' Day.

　　In Moscow, Leningrad, and other railway cities, railway workers held celebratory meetings and summarized the results of the socialist emulation drives conducted to celebrate the festival. At the commemorative meeting held in Moscow's Gorky Culture and Rest Park, renowned railway workers and Stalin Prize laureates were warmly welcomed by the audience. Soviet Minister of Railways Beshchev delivered a speech, congratulating the Soviet railway transport industry on its tremendous achievements and pointing out the great significance of the Soviet railway workers' struggle to defend peace.

　　Soviet Deputy Minister of Railways Markevich, in a talk before the festival, stated: Under the Soviet regime, the Soviet railway network has doubled. Thousands of kilometers of newly built railways have helped develop new coal, oil, and non-ferrous metal mining areas, and have also helped develop agriculture. Soviet railways have undergone fundamental technical transformation, acquiring new types of locomotives and carriages, and new progress has been made in railway electrification. As early as 1948, railway transportation had already exceeded pre-war levels. The current level of transportation is much higher than the target set by the Five-Year Plan for last year. A large number of new technical experts have emerged in railway transport work. During the Soviet era, higher education institutions have trained more than 60,000 railway transport experts. Currently, the movement to strive for each locomotive to travel 500 kilometers per day is expanding. Due to the increase in labor productivity, hundreds of thousands of railway workers have greatly exceeded the work quotas stipulated in the Five-Year Plan.

　　The People's Daily published an editorial on the 30th, stating: The progress of Soviet railway transport fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. Now, in terms of transport volume per kilometer, Soviet railways rank first in the world. On the road to communism, the Soviet railway industry is unfolding a magnificent future.

　　苏人民庆祝铁路员工节
    苏铁路每公里运输量居世界首位
    【新华社一日讯】综合塔斯社消息。七月三十日，苏联人民广泛庆祝苏联铁路员工节。
    在莫斯科、列宁格勒及其他铁路城市，铁路员工都举行了庆祝大会，并且总结了为庆祝这一节日而进行的社会主义竞赛的成果。在莫斯科高尔基文化与休息公园举行的纪念大会上，著名的铁路工人与斯大林奖金获得者，受到了会众的热烈欢迎。苏联铁道部长别什切夫发表演说，祝贺苏联铁道运输业的巨大成就，并指出苏联铁路工人保卫和平的斗争的伟大意义。
    苏联铁道部副部长马尔凯维奇，在节日前夕发表谈话称：在苏维埃政权下，苏联的铁路网已增加了一倍。数千公里新建的铁道，帮助了开发新的煤、石油和非铁金属矿区，也帮助了发展农业。苏联的铁路在技术上已经过了根本的改造，获得了新式的机车和车厢，铁路电气化也有新的进展。早在一九四八年，铁路运输即已超过战前水平。现在的运输水平，又比五年计划为去年规定的目标提高了许多。铁路运输工作中已出现了大批新的技术专家，在苏维埃时代，高等教育机关训练出来的铁路运输专家共达六万余人。现在，争取每一机车日行五百公里的运动，正日益扩大中。由于劳动生产率的提高，数十万铁路工人已大大超过了五年计划所规定的工作定额。
    真理报于三十日发表社论称：苏联铁路运输的进展，充分说明了社会主义制度的优越性。现在就每公里的运输量来说，苏联铁路是居于世界首位的。在向共产主义前进的道路上，苏联的铁路事业正展开着壮阔的远景。
