Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th. The Tianjin Municipal Tax Bureau has achieved results in strictly suppressing smuggling and preventing tax evasion, and violations of tax laws are gradually decreasing. In the first half of this year, the Tax Bureau uncovered more than 6,000 cases of tax violations. Taxes recovered and fines levied amounted to more than 3.6 billion yuan. In addition, some illegal cases outside the scope of taxation were also uncovered during the inspection, such as trading in gold and silver, underground banks, and selling drugs, which have been handed over to the judicial authorities for handling.

The inspection work of the Tianjin Municipal Tax Bureau is improving continuously. Last year, in its inspection work, the city had a deviation of "fussing over the small and letting go of the big," that is, only paying attention to street vendors and not paying attention to formal businesses. Therefore, the work of preventing tax evasion was not very effective. In the first half of this year, the bureau gradually corrected this deviation, shifting the focus of inspection work to formal businesses, and broadly organizing and mobilizing the masses to assist in anti-smuggling. At the same time, in dealing with violations, it adopted a policy of combining appropriate punishment with emphasis on education, so tax evasion has been greatly reduced.

    稽查重心面向正式商户广泛发动群众协助缉私
    【新华社天津十六日电】天津市税务局在严密缉私、防堵偷漏方面已做出成绩，违章偷漏案件已经逐渐减少。今年上半年内，税务局共缉获税务违章案件六千余件。因补税或加罚而补进的税款达三十六亿余元。此外，在稽查中并破获一部税务范围以外的非法案件，如买卖金银、地下钱庄、贩卖毒品等，已随时送交司法机关处理。
    天津市税务局的稽查工作是在不断改进中提高的。该市去年在稽查工作上曾发生过“纠缠小的、放松大的”，即只注意街头小贩，不注意正式商户的偏向。因此不仅杜绝偷漏的工作收效不大。今年上半年中，该局逐渐纠正了这种偏向，将稽查工作重心转向正式商户，并广泛组织和发动群众来协助缉私，同时在处理违章案件上采取适当处罚与着重教育相结合的方针，因此偷漏现象大减。
