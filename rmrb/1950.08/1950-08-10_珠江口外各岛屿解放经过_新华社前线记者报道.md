Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 9th: Guangdong Frontline Reporter reports: After continuous and heroic battles by a unit of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army, the solemn and bright five-star national flag is now flying proudly in the sea breeze over the islands outside the Pearl River Estuary.

The People's Liberation Army launched three consecutive attacks between late May and early August. On the morning of May 25th, the PLA's land and naval forces launched an attack on the islands outside the Pearl River Estuary, where remnant bandits were entrenched. The PLA, aboard dozens of gunboats of various sizes, cut through the misty sea and headed straight for the islands, focusing primarily on Lajiwei Island. After a fierce naval battle, the enemy's gunboat group, which outnumbered us tenfold, was dealt a devastating blow. Our troops landed on Qingzhou, Sanjiaoshan, Niutou, and other places. On the 26th, our troops continued to liberate Chizhou Island. At dawn on the 27th, we victoriously broke through the enemy's fortified positions, liberated Lajiwei Island, and continued eastward, liberating Da and Xiao Zhizhuzhou on the 29th. Another PLA unit headed south at dawn on the 27th to liberate Da Liuzhou, and on the 31st, they completely liberated Dongao Island. In seven days, our troops captured 31 islands of various sizes, ending the first stage of the battle.

After a short period of reorganization and preparation, our troops continued to advance on June 5th against the stubbornly resisting remnants. Our land and naval forces crossed from Dongao to launch an attack on the Wanshan Islands. On the morning of that day, we successfully landed on Baili Island, and then divided our forces into two routes to attack and advance. The western route troops occupied Zhuzhou Island at 11:00 am on the same day, and the southern route troops liberated Da and Xiao Wanshan at the same time. Our troops gathered on Da Zhizhuzhou Island also attacked Aizhou Island on the morning of the 10th and immediately liberated the island. In just six days, our troops liberated the Wanshan Islands and Aizhou and other 14 islands. On June 26th, the PLA continued to launch island-by-island attacks on Wai Lingding and the Sanmen Islands. The remnant enemies fled at the sight of us. By July 1st, our troops had completely liberated Wai Lingding and the Sanmen Islands, totaling eight islands.

At this time, a typhoon swept across the South China Sea. The PLA's land and naval forces, stationed on sparsely populated islands, braved the onslaught of strong winds and torrential rain, enduring hunger and waiting anxiously for the order to launch the final attack. On the morning of August 3rd, as soon as the typhoon had passed, the commanders and soldiers excitedly boarded the gunboats upon receiving their orders and suddenly charged towards the enemy's positions. In just ten minutes, they broke through the enemy's defenses and landed on Dangan Island. After ten hours of island-by-island attacks, they completely liberated the five islands of the Dangan Islands. The next day, August 4th, they continued to carry out the final mopping-up operation on the Jiafeng Islands, completely liberating all 18 islands of the archipelago in one day, victoriously concluding the campaign to liberate all the islands outside the Pearl River Estuary.

　　珠江口外各岛屿解放经过
    新华社前线记者报道
    【新华社汉口九日电】广东前线记者报道：经过人民解放军第四野战军某部的连续英勇战斗，庄严鲜明的五星国旗已在珠江口外各岛屿上迎着海风飘扬招展。
    解放军是在五月下旬到八月初的期间内连续发动了三次攻击的。五月二十五日的清晨，解放军的陆、海军部队，向残匪盘踞的珠江口外各岛发起攻击。解放军乘着数十艘大小炮艇，穿过白雾迷茫的海面，直扑以垃圾尾岛为主的一群岛屿。经过激烈的海战，予十倍于我的匪艇群以歼灭性的打击，我军在青洲、三角山、牛头等地登陆。我军于二十六日继续解放赤洲岛，二十七日拂晓，胜利突破敌人强固阵地，解放垃圾尾岛，并继续东进于二十九日解放大、细蜘蛛洲。另路解放军于二十七日拂晓向南解放大流洲，三十一日全部解放东澳岛。我军在七天中，连克三十一个大小岛屿，结束第一阶段的战斗。
    经过短期的整补和准备后，我军于六月五日继续向负隅顽抗的残敌进击。我陆海部队由东澳起渡向万山群岛展开攻击，是日晨在白沥岛胜利登陆，继分兵两路攻击前进，西路部队于同日十一时占领竹洲岛，南路部队于同时解放大小万山。我集结在大蜘蛛岛部队亦于十日清晨向隘洲岛进击，当即解放该岛。在短短六日内我军解放了万山群岛及隘洲等十四个岛屿。六月二十六日，解放军继续向外伶仃及三门列岛展开逐岛攻击，残敌望风逃窜，至七月一日，我军全部解放了外伶仃及三门列岛等八个岛屿。
    此时，南海海面卷起台风，扼守在人烟稀少的岛屿上的解放军陆、海部队，冒着狂风暴雨的侵袭，忍饥挨饿，以急迫的心情等待着最后攻击的命令。在八月三日的清晨，台风刚过去时，指战员们受命兴奋地登上了炮艇，突向敌阵，仅十分钟的功夫，即突破敌阵，在担秆岛登陆，经过十小时的逐岛攻击，全部解放了担杆群岛的五个岛屿；次日，八月四日，继续向佳逢列岛进行最后的扫荡，一日内将该列岛的十八个岛屿全部解放，胜利地结束了解放珠江口外所有岛屿的战役。
