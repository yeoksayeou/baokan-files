Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, after reporting to and obtaining approval from the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, issued three documents on August 14: "Provisional Regulations for Higher Education," "Provisional Regulations for Junior Colleges," and "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Institutions of Higher Education."

　　The "Provisional Regulations for Higher Education" stipulate that the purpose of higher education institutions in the People's Republic of China is, according to the provisions of Chapter Five of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, to cultivate senior construction talents with high cultural levels, who master modern science and technology achievements, and wholeheartedly serve the people through educational methods that combine theory and practice. Higher education institutions include both universities and specialized colleges, and junior colleges will also be established to meet the urgent needs of national construction. The establishment and closure of universities and specialized colleges shall be decided by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government upon reporting by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government. Universities and specialized colleges shall have a number of departments, and the establishment or change thereof shall be decided by the Ministry of Education. The length of study in universities and specialized colleges shall be determined based on the complexity of the curriculum of each department, with three to five years as the principle. The curriculum of each department in universities and specialized colleges shall be formulated based on the needs of national construction and the principle of combining theory and practice, and curriculum standards shall be separately determined. Universities and specialized colleges shall report the teaching plans and syllabi of each course to the Ministry of Education for record. Regarding teaching organization, the provisional regulations stipulate that the teaching and research guidance group shall be the basic teaching organization, composed of all teachers of one course or several courses of similar nature. The responsibilities of the teaching and research group are: (1) to lead all teachers in the group, discuss and formulate the teaching plan and syllabus for the courses in the group; (2) to lead and inspect the teaching work and research work of the group; (3) to lead and organize the students' self-study, experiments, and internships. Regarding social organizations and activities within institutions of higher education, the provisional regulations stipulate that trade unions, student unions, and other social organizations in universities and specialized colleges shall unite all faculty, staff, and students in the entire school (college), assist the school in completing teaching and administrative plans, promote the political, professional, and cultural learning of all faculty, staff, and students in the entire school (college), and improve the welfare of faculty, staff, and students. Universities and specialized colleges may establish various academic organizations to promote the improvement and popularization of science and culture.

　　The "Provisional Regulations for Junior Colleges" stipulate that the purpose of junior colleges is to cultivate specialized technical talents who can master the achievements of modern science and technology and wholeheartedly serve the cause of new democratic construction through educational methods that combine theory and practice. The establishment or closure of junior colleges shall be decided by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government or in consultation with other government departments. The length of study in junior colleges is two to three years. Junior colleges may have a number of disciplines, and the curriculum of each discipline shall be formulated based on the needs of national construction and the principle of combining theory and practice, and curriculum standards shall be separately determined. Junior colleges shall report the teaching plans and syllabi of each course to the Ministry of Education for record. Other provisions regarding teaching organization, social organizations within the school, etc., are the same as in the "Provisional Regulations for Higher Education."

　　The spirit of the "Provisional Measures for the Administration of Private Institutions of Higher Education" lies in strengthening leadership and actively supporting and transforming private institutions of higher education to meet the needs of national construction. The provisional measures stipulate that the policies, tasks, academic system, curriculum, teaching, and administrative organization of private institutions of higher education (universities, specialized colleges, and junior colleges) must comply with the "Provisional Regulations for Higher Education" and the "Provisional Regulations for Junior Colleges." Private institutions of higher education that have been reviewed by the education departments or cultural and educational departments of the Greater Administrative Regions and whose performance is excellent but whose funding is indeed difficult may report to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government for approval to grant appropriate subsidies. The administrative power, financial power, and property ownership of private institutions of higher education shall be held by Chinese citizens. All private institutions of higher education in the country, whether or not they have been registered in the past, must reapply for registration. Private institutions of higher education shall not make religious courses compulsory or force students to participate in religious ceremonies and activities. The property of private institutions of higher education shall not be used for purposes other than school funding, and the transfer of property rights shall not be made without the approval of the Ministry of Education of the Greater Administrative Region and the reporting to the Ministry of Education of the Central Government for verification. If a private institution of higher education wishes to close or change, its board of directors must report to the education department of the Greater Administrative Region for review and report to the Ministry of Education of the Central Government for approval five months before the end of the academic year. If a private institution of higher education is poorly managed or violates laws and regulations, the education department of the Greater Administrative Region may report to the Ministry of Education of the Central Government for approval to order it to reorganize its board of directors, replace the president, and reorganize or close the school.
