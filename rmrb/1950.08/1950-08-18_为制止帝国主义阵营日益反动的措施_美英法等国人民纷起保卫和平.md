Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: According to TASS, New York, 16th dispatch: Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the United States, and other leaders, William Z. Foster, Chairman; Gus Hall, Secretary; and Robert G. Thompson, Organization Secretary; and John Williamson, Labor Secretary, issued a joint statement to the press, severely condemning the U.S. government for threatening to imprison Communist leaders for defending peace.

The statement declared: Attorney General McGrath is demanding the imprisonment of eleven Communist leaders. The Wall Street government will declare the right to bail invalid on the grounds that, if these eleven people are not immediately imprisoned, they will publish statements "harmful to the public welfare and national security of the United States."

The Truman government and the Republican opposition loyal to it both admit that they have "failed in the propaganda war." In other words, the people of the United States and the world have presented an indictment proving that Wall Street is guilty of endangering world peace. That is why they are busy cutting off the heads of the forces of peace and intimidating all forces of peace. That is why the two party leaders are taking typical fascist measures, step by step, forcing the Communist Party and all defenders of peace and freedom in the labor movement, among black people, women, and youth to go underground.

The statement declared: "The American working class and the American people have never needed our party's steady hand at the helm as much as they do today. If the legal existence of the Communist Party is destroyed, it will inevitably destroy all freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and political association. We Communists will not be caught off guard, nor will we be negligent. We will not run away, we will stand here and fight for the Bill of Rights. We will unite our party and the people to resist and defeat this terrible attack on the Constitution and its Bill of Rights. We call on all party organizations and members to go among the people and, in a very short time, organize a broad mass movement to defend our right to bail. This movement was victorious last October, and it can be victorious again. Defend the right to speak for peace. Defend the legal existence of the Communist Party. Defend the rights of bail and appeal. Let Truman and McGrath hear the voice of the people. Allow the Communist leaders to be bailed. Do not destroy the Bill of Rights!"

　　为制止帝国主义阵营日益反动的措施
    美英法等国人民纷起保卫和平
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国共产党全国委员会主席福斯特、书记霍尔、组织部长温斯顿和劳工部长威廉逊，向新闻界发表联合声明，严斥美国政府因共产党领袖们保卫和平而威胁着要把他们监禁起来。
    声明宣称：司法部长麦格拉斯要求把十一位共产党领袖监禁起来。华尔街政府将宣布保释的权利无效，理由是：倘若不把这十一个人立刻监禁起来，他们就会发表“危害美国公共福利和国家安全的”声明。
    杜鲁门政府和效忠于它的共和党反对派，都承认他们“在宣传战中失败”，换句话说，美国和全世界的人民都提出了一个判决书，证明华尔街犯有危害世界和平的罪行。这就是他们所以忙着要斩去和平势力的首级、并且威吓一切和平势力的缘故。这就是两党领袖们所以一步一步地采取典型的法西斯方式，逼迫共产党和在劳工运动、黑人、妇女和青年中间的一切和平与自由的保卫者转入地下的缘故。
    声明宣称：“美国的工人阶级和美国的人民，以往从未像今天这样需要我党稳健的手来掌舵。如果摧毁共产党的合法存在，那就不会不摧毁一切言论、出版、集会和政治性结社的自由。我们共产党员决不会仓惶失措，我们也决不会疏忽大意。我们决不逃跑，我们将站定在这里为民权法案而奋斗。我们将团结我们的党与人民，来抵抗并且击败对宪法及其民权法案的这种可怕的袭击。我们号召所有党的组织和党员走到人民中间去，在极短的时间之内组织起广大的群众运动，来保卫我们保释的权利。这种运动在去年十月间曾经获得胜利，它可以再度获得胜利。保卫为和平而发言的权利。保卫共产党的合法存在。保卫保释与上诉的权利。让杜鲁门和麦格拉斯听听人民的声音。准许共产党领袖们保释。不许破坏民权法案！”
