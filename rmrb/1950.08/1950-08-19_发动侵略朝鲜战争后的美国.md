Hong Kong Wenhui Bao American Air Dispatch

　　The United States After Launching the Aggression Against the Korean War

Xinhua News Agency, 17th. Hong Kong’s Wenhui Bao published a dispatch from its U.S. correspondent Wan Ge on August 8th, dated July 22nd, entitled "The United States After Launching the Aggression Against the Korean War." The abstract is as follows:

After the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, when an American plane shot down a North Korean People's Army plane for the first time over an airport near Seoul, the pilot's photo was published in major newspapers across the United States the next day. Even the anecdotes of his youth as the captain of the school football team made the news. In an instant, he became an American hero who "showed off his power overseas." A week later, when Seoul and Suwon both fell, and even the American air and naval forces that came personally could not stop the advance of the Korean People's Army, Baldwin, a New York Times reporter who was always regarded as an authority on American military commentary, still optimistically stated in the newspaper: "If the morale of the North Korean troops can collapse under the American air raids and artillery fire, like the South Korean troops, then the United States only needs to dispatch one division or less of the army to accomplish great things."

The optimistic atmosphere of these early battles, four weeks later, has become the most embarrassing self-mockery in the history of American imperialism's armed aggression overseas. At that time, the United States, relying on the strength of its naval, land, and air forces, regarded the military intervention in the Korean civil war as a military game, but it did not expect that the awakened Asian people could not be easily bullied. On July 10, Senator Tydings, chairman of the Senate Military Committee, listened to Chief of Staff Bradley's secret report on the current situation in the subcommittee and said to visiting reporters in a serious tone: MacArthur is facing a long and difficult war. Senators who participated in the subcommittee meeting later revealed that Bradley had frankly admitted in the report that the U.S. military was in danger of being completely expelled from the Korean Peninsula. When the U.S. military was about to be forced to withdraw from Daejeon, Truman announced a partial mobilization to the country, and the American people concluded that this was no longer the "police action" that Truman had initially said, but was preparing for another world war.

The four weeks of the armed aggression against the Korean War have continuously brought ugly battle reports from the front line to American imperialism. A Life magazine reporter said in his dispatch: The effectiveness of American shells hitting North Korean heavy tanks is like ping-pong balls. A New York Times reporter's telegram said: American soldiers feel that the attitude of the South Korean people is either indifferent to the American army or contains active hostility. "We simply cannot tell who our enemies are." A soldier who had just retreated from the battlefield and was still terrified told a United Press reporter: "Every time he knocked down an enemy, there would be about twenty successors to fill his vacancy." A United Press reporter reported: "A company of American troops with 148 people was left with only 30 people after a few days of fighting. Less than 20 percent of the wounded soldiers were able to evacuate before the retreat." A female reporter from the New York Herald Tribune sent back a telegram saying: "Many American officers and soldiers originally thought that as long as the United States took action, the North Korean army would collapse immediately. Now they know that this is not such an easy thing… The U.S. military's failure to win a few battles at the beginning has swept away the prestige of the U.S. military."

The Korean War was not a war related to the survival of the American people. Now that there are such losses, the mood of the American people is even lower. When MacArthur appeared in newsreels in movie theaters, the audience's reaction was not a burst of warm applause, but a meaningful silence. Even the so-called GIs (i.e., American soldiers), who have always been popular, did not receive a warmer response. When the screen showed American people demanding mediation and peace being forcibly dragged out of the United Nations Security Council by security personnel, sounds of dissatisfaction emanated from all around.

When the First Marine Division left California for Korea, the docks were crowded with women and children who came to see off their husbands and fathers. The enthusiastic scene of generously sending their husbands to the front lines was not seen. What enveloped them was the thread-like tears and suppressed sobs on the faces of the women. When New York City called on Americans to volunteer for the army, it even mobilized cabaret dancers to use kisses as encouragement, but the number of volunteers was still very few. More than 300 housewives have gone to Lake Success to petition the United Nations for peace. Many of them are Gold Star mothers (sons who died in World War II).

The morale of American soldiers on the Korean front is as low as at home. A sergeant was hit in the toe by a strafing plane, but instead of screaming in pain, he was overjoyed and shouted loudly: "Who has a letter for me to take back home?" The soldiers who went to the Korean front were originally occupying forces in Japan, who were accustomed to enjoying themselves. Many of them are still "tender babies" who have never been on the battlefield. On the way to Korea, they were still talking about "Korean girls." When they were forced to retreat from the battlefield, they scolded the U.S. Department of Defense for sending them to the front line. When ambushing People's Army troops appeared everywhere, they could only raise their hands and surrender.

Faced with this low morale, the American imperialists are using the cheapest methods to stimulate the fighting emotions of American soldiers and people. Collective promotions are being used on the front lines to encourage morale. When a New York Times reporter asked an American soldier about his rank, the American soldier said contemptuously: "Of course it's a sergeant, who isn't these days!"

At home, the Department of Defense is doing its best to conceal its defeats and exaggerate its victories. The continuous retreat of the U.S. military, "losing the land of Korea," does not worry most Americans. However, the heavy casualties suffered by the U.S. military cannot but move the American people who are parents and wives. In order to avoid causing a huge reaction at home, although the North Korean war reports and the telegrams sent back by American reporters from the front line show that thousands and hundreds of U.S. troops have been annihilated and captured, the names of the casualties and missing persons announced by the Department of Defense every day are always very few. At the same time, because some frontline reporters failed to cooperate with the Department of Defense in concealing the fact that the U.S. military suffered heavy casualties in their telegrams, MacArthur's headquarters once openly revoked the right of two male reporters (one each from United Press and Associated Press) and one female reporter (New York Herald Tribune) to report on the front lines. The reason is that the reports of the former two had "the danger of aiding the enemy," and the latter was "not suitable for activities in the war zone" because she was a woman. In fact, these three were the reporters who reported relatively truthfully. On the other hand, the Department of Defense continues to maintain the American belief that "American weapons are invincible" by constantly exaggerating the results of the war (especially the air force war reports). Baldwin of the New York Times once frankly warned readers: "Our air force war reports are overly optimistic… If we claim to have destroyed 60 enemy tanks, in reality we probably only destroyed 15." Another mouthpiece of Wall Street, "U.S. News & World Report," said: "If you believe the results reported by the pilots, the U.S. Air Force should have already destroyed all the tanks of North Korea. But North Korean tanks are still being driven to the front lines in large numbers."

The last tactic of the Department of Defense is to fabricate the "atrocities" of the Korean People's Army, attempting to use this to ignite the American people's hatred for the Korean People's Army. In the past two days, it has continuously released news saying that the surrendered U.S. troops were shot one by one by the People's Army after their hands were tied. In the past few days, some newspapers have published the corpses of American prisoners of war who were "brutally killed" in this way. However, there are still many people who do not believe in these "enemy atrocities" war reports. Murray Kempton, a columnist for the New York Compass, warned readers not to forget the lie that during World War II, Britain wanted Americans to believe that every German soldier who passed through Belgium had a child stuck on the tip of his bayonet in order to get the United States to participate in the war.

### 发动侵略朝鲜战争后的美国

专栏：香港文汇报美国航讯

　　发动侵略朝鲜战争后的美国
    【新华社十七日讯】香港文汇报于八月八日刊载该报驻美特派记者万歌七月二十二日航寄的一篇通讯，题为《发动侵略朝鲜战争后的美国》。摘要如下：
    美国侵略朝鲜的战争发生后，当一架美机在汉城附近机场上空首次击落一架朝鲜人民军的飞机后，那机师的照片第二天便在全美各大报纸上刊登出来，连少年时代曾任学校足球队长的轶史也上了新闻，刹那间成了“扬威海外”的美国英雄。及至一星期后，汉城、水原皆告不守，连亲自出马的美国海空军都阻止不了朝鲜人民军进军时，一向被目为美国军事评论权威的纽约时报记者鲍尔温也还在报端乐观地说：“如果北朝鲜部队的士气在美军的空袭和炮击下能像南朝鲜部队一样地宣告瓦解，那么美国只须出动一师或不到一师的陆军便可完成大事了。”
    这些战事初期的乐观气氛在四周后的今天看来，已成为美帝国主义海外武装侵略史上最困窘的自嘲。美国当时自恃海陆空军力量的强大，把干预朝鲜内战的军事行动，当作一次军事游戏，没想到觉醒了的亚洲人民是那样地不能轻侮。七月十日，参院军事委员会主席泰丁斯在小组委员会上听取了参谋总长布莱德雷对当前局势的秘密报告后，以严肃的口吻向往访的记者说：麦克阿瑟面对的将是一个长远和困难的战争。据参与该小组委员会会议的参议员事后透露：布莱德雷曾在报告中坦白承认美军有从朝鲜半岛上整个被逐出的危险。及至美军即将被迫退出大田，杜鲁门向全国广播宣布局部动员时，美国人民便断定这已不再是杜鲁门当初所说的“警察行动”，而是在准备走向又一次大战了。
    四星期的武装侵略朝鲜的战争，不断的为美帝国主义从前线上带来了难看的战讯。生活画报的记者在他的通讯中说：美军的炮弹打在北朝鲜重型坦克上的效力好似乒乓球。纽约时报记者的电讯说：美国士兵觉得南朝鲜人民的态度若非对美军视若无睹，便是含有积极的敌意。“我们简直无法辨认谁是我们的敌人”。一个刚从战场上退下来而犹有余悸的士兵告诉美联社的记者说：“他每击倒一个敌人，便会有二十个左右的后继者前来填补他的空缺。”合众社的记者报道：“拥有一百四十八人的一连美军，经过几天的交锋，只剩下三十个人了。受伤的士兵能在退却前撤走的不足百分之二十。”纽约先驱论坛报的女记者发回来的电讯说：“美国许多官兵原先以为只要美国一动手，北朝鲜的军队便会立刻崩溃的。现在已知道这并不是那样容易的事了……。美军不能一开始便打几场胜仗，已经使美军威信扫地。”
    朝鲜战事原不是有关美国人民生存的战争。现在这样的损兵折将，美国人民的情绪便更形低落。电影院中麦克阿瑟在新闻片中出现时，观众的反应不是一阵热烈的掌声，而是一片意味深长的无言的沉默，连一向吃香的所谓ＧＩ（按即美国大兵）出现时，也无较热烈的反应。及至银幕上映出要求调停和平的美国人民在联合国安理会会场上被警卫人员用强力拖出会场时，表示不满的啧啧声便从四座发出了。
    当海军陆战队第一师自加州开赴朝鲜时，码头上挤满了来送别丈夫和父亲的妇女和子女。慷慨送郎赴前线的热烈场面是见不到的。笼罩着的是妇女们脸上线样的泪珠和压抑着的低泣。纽约市号召美国人志愿入伍时，还动员了夜总会的歌舞女郎用送吻来作鼓励，但是志愿入役的仍是寥寥无几。三百多名家庭妇女已经去成功湖的联合国为和平而请愿。其中不少是带有金星的母亲（儿子曾在第二次大战时战死）。
    朝鲜前线美国士兵的士气和国内一样的低。一个军曹被飞机扫射击中足尖后不但没呼痛，反而喜出望外大声地喊道：“谁有信要我带回国啊？”开赴朝鲜前线的士兵原都是在日本的占领军，是一向享乐惯了的。其中不少还是“嫩娃娃”，根本没上过战场，在去朝鲜的途上还在纵谈着“朝鲜姑娘”，从战场上被迫节节败退时，便大骂美国国防部把他们送上前线去，及至伏击的人民军到处出现时，他们便只有双手一举投降了。
    面对着这低落的士气，美帝国主义者正在以最廉价的方法来刺激美国士兵和人民的作战情绪，在前线上正用集体擢升的方法来激励士气。纽约时报一个记者探问某美兵的官阶时，那美兵轻蔑地说：“当然是军曹罗，在今天还有谁不是！”
    在国内，国防部正尽力一面掩饰败绩，一面夸大战果。美军的不断败退，“失掉的原是朝鲜的土地”，一般美国人并不着急。但美军所遭受的惨重的伤亡，为人父母妻子的美国人民却不能无动于中。为着避免在国内引起极大的反响，虽则北朝鲜的战报以及美国记者本身从前线发回的电讯都显示着美军成千成百的被歼、被俘，但国防部每天公布的伤亡以及失踪者的姓名却始终是寥寥无几的。同时，为了一些前线记者未能与国防部合作在电讯中掩饰美军伤亡惨重这事实，麦克阿瑟总部一度还公然取消两个男记者（合众美联各一）与一个女记者（纽约先驱论坛报）在前线采访的权利。理由是前二人的报道有“资敌危险”，后者因是女性“不适宜在战地活动”。其实这三人正是比较起来算是据实报道的记者。另一方面，国防部则不断以夸大战果（尤其是空车的战报）来继续维持美国人那“美军武器无敌”的信念。纽约时报的鲍尔温曾坦白警告读者：“我们空军的战报是过分乐观的。……如果我们宣称击毁了敌军坦克六十辆，实际上大概是只击毁了十五辆。”华尔街另一喉舌《美国新闻与世界报道》说：“若相信飞行员所报道的战果，美国空军应早已击毁了全部北朝鲜所有的坦克。但北朝鲜坦克却还大量的在开上前线。”
    国防部末一个策略便是捏造朝鲜人民军的“暴行”，企图以此燃起美国人民对朝鲜人民军的仇恨。前二天便不断发表消息说，投降美军在双手被缚后一一为人民军所枪毙。这几天一些报刊上更刊出了如此被“残杀”的美俘的尸体。可是，不相信这类“敌军暴行”战报的人却仍然不少。纽约指南针日报的专栏作家潘莱便曾告诫读者，勿忘第二次战时英国为了要美国参战，曾要美人相信每个通过比利时的德军的刺刀尖上都插着一个小孩的谎言。
