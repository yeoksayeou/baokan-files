　　Timely Inspection and Correction of Deviations
    Baoding Rectification and Study Get on the Right Track
    [Our Newspaper Dispatches] After the Baoding Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China instructed all departments on July 28th to pay attention to the fact that the focus of rectification should be leading cadres, it conducted a preliminary inspection of the rectification and study in the previous two weeks and found the following problems: First, the focus of rectification was not clear enough. Although the Municipal Committee had repeatedly pointed out that the rectification should be carried out in accordance with the instructions of the North China Bureau, first rectifying the leadership and then the general staff; however, in the process, there were still phenomena of rectifying subordinates but not superiors. The power plant reported several times on the rectification of technicians, skilled workers, etc., without mentioning the leadership's problems at all. Some leading comrades in some units did not even participate in the rectification and study. Second, instead of inspecting the work "in a practical and realistic manner," they looked for factual errors under the labels of bureaucracy and commandism, which not only mechanically put everything under the labels of bureaucracy and commandism, but also blurred the main problems in the inspection work. Some departments did not connect with individuals from the inspection work, but simply inspected individual thoughts and lives. Therefore, some people could not delve into it and began to chew on terminologies. The retail company discussed the term "restraining capital" for four hours; and some argued endlessly over the use of a few words. After discovering the above problems, the Municipal Committee immediately convened a cadre meeting for review and mobilization, emphasizing that the administrative heads must be responsible for the rectification and do it themselves; they must start from inspecting and summarizing the work; and they must first rectify the Municipal Committee leadership and then the general leading organs, and also determined some specific methods, such as each agency can hold various symposiums according to the nature of its work, and solicit opinions from representatives of workers, technicians, industrial and commercial circles, education circles, and other social strata to inspect and improve their work. After the meeting, the party committees and groups of the city conducted research and discussion and insisted on implementing the instructions of the Municipal Committee. Subsequently, the Municipal Government held three symposiums for education, workers, and industrial and commercial circles, inviting everyone to inspect the government's work. The Municipal Committee is also preparing to convene a meeting of key responsible cadres from various departments to inspect the leadership of the Municipal Committee. The party branches of various agencies also cooperated to carry out ideological education, and some agencies criticized the liberal attitude of "harmony is all that matters," and initially broke the deadlock of non-criticism. Some departments also paid attention to improving their work at any time. The Tax Bureau strengthened research work in tax collection, which greatly improved work efficiency; and paid attention to implementing policies and overcoming the simple and rigid work style of the past.

　　及时检查纠正偏向
    保定整风学习走上正轨
    【本报讯】中共保定市委于七月二十八日指示各部门注意整风重点必须是领导干部以后，对前两旬的整风学习作了初步检查，即发现以下几个问题：第一、整风重点不够明确。市委虽曾再三指出要依据华北局指示先整领导后整一般的方针进行整风；但是在进行中，仍发生了有整下不整上的现象。发电厂几次汇报，总是技师、技工等整风情况，根本不提领导方面的问题。甚至还有些单位的领导同志根本不参加整风学习。第二、不是“实事求是”的来检查工作，而是在官僚主义、命令主义帽子下寻找错误事实，这样不仅机械地把一切都扣上个官僚主义，命令主义的帽子；而且模糊了检查工作中的主要问题。有些部门并且不是从检查工作联系个人，而是单纯检查个人思想和生活等问题。因此，有些人钻不进去而啃起名词术语来，零售公司为了“节制资本”一个名词，讨论了四小时；还有些为几个字的用法争论不休。市委在发现以上问题后，即召开干部大会进行检讨，动员，着重指出了整风必须行政首长负责，亲自动手；必须从检查总结工作着手；并且要先整市委领导后整一般领导机关，还确定了一些具体方法，例如各机关可根据本机关工作性质召开各种座谈会，征求工人、技术人员、工商界、教育界等各阶层代表人士的意见，以检查与改进自己的工作。会后，市各党委分会，小组都进行了研究讨论，坚持贯彻市委的指示。随后市府召开了教育、工人、工商界三个座谈会，邀请大家来检查政府工作。市委也准备召集各部门主要负责干部开会，检查市委领导。各机关支部也配合进行了思想教育，有些机关就批评了“一团和气”的自由主义态度，初步打开了互不批评的僵局。有些部门并注意随时改进工作。税务局在税收中加强了研究工作，工作效率因此大大提高；并注意贯彻政策，克服了过去简单生硬的工作作风。
