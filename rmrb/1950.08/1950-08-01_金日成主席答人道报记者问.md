　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 31st: Manian, a reporter from the French newspaper *l'Humanité*, who returned to Pyongyang from the Korean front, met with General Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the 27th and inquired about several issues in the current Korean War situation. The questions raised by Manian and General Kim Il-sung's responses are as follows:

　　Q: How does Your Excellency evaluate the military situation in Korea one month after the start of the war?

　　A: The Korean people do not want war, and the democratic forces in Korea have consistently struggled for the peaceful unification of our country. However, the lackeys of American imperialism—the Korean reactionaries—launched a fratricidal civil war. Documents seized by the People's Army in Seoul fully prove that the war launched by the Syngman Rhee army was prepared long ago under the instruction of the U.S. military mission in Seoul.

　　It is clear that the American imperialists provoked the civil war in Korea not only to find an excuse for armed aggression against Korea, but also to implement the U.S. aggressive policy in other regions of Asia, and to implement the militaristic and fascist plans of the American war-mongers, making countries already subordinate to the United States even more obedient to the American imperialists.

　　As for the attempt of the anti-popular Syngman Rhee traitorous clique to provoke the war, it lies in implementing the instructions of its American masters, dreaming of using war to resolve their crisis and consolidate their increasingly collapsing rule.

　　The American imperialists dared to launch a war in Korea because they underestimated the strength of the Korean people. However, with the active support of the entire people and the guerrillas, the Korean People's Army, in only one month of fighting, has liberated three-quarters of South Korea, annihilated a large number of Syngman Rhee's puppet troops and U.S. troops landing in Korea, completely annihilated the U.S. 24th Division, and is now victoriously continuing to advance.

　　The People's Army has been tempered in battle, accumulated combat experience, and will gradually become a stronger army.

　　Q: Does Your Excellency think the Korean war will be long-term or short-term?

　　A: If there were no foreign armed intervention, the Korean war would have ended long ago. Undoubtedly, the American aggression is prolonging the war, and we do not expect to achieve victory easily. However, the Korean people have a strong will and will never stop fighting until they have completely driven the American aggressors from our territory and achieved final victory.

　　Q: What are the reasons for the People's Army's victory over the military force of the American imperialists?

　　A: The victory of the People's Army is primarily due to the fact that the war it is waging is a just war for the freedom and independence of its own motherland, against the American aggressors and their running dogs.

　　Every officer and soldier of the People's Army clearly understands this. The Korean people, who have experienced a long period of colonial life, are no longer willing to be slaves of the American imperialists.

　　The People's Army is fighting with the unwavering support of the entire Korean people and the sympathy and support of progressive mankind around the world. All of this encourages our People's Army and the entire Korean people to embark on the path of completing heroic feats.

　　At the same time, our People's Army possesses sufficient armed forces. These are the fundamental reasons for the victory of our People's Army. But on the contrary, the American army is waging an aggressive and unjust war to enslave the Korean people. Of course, this war is not needed by the American people and American soldiers. Therefore, it is not surprising that they cannot fight well in Korea and are captured or surrender to the People's Army in batches.

　　Q: Will the losses suffered due to the U.S. air raids affect the end of the war? What do the Korean people think of the atrocities of the American aggressors in Korea?

　　A: U.S. aircraft are frantically bombing Korean cities and villages, massacring peaceful residents, and barbarously trampling on generally recognized war regulations. When they bomb, they never target military objectives, but continue to bomb undefended cities, brutally bombing houses and buildings, leaving residents homeless and indiscriminately slaughtering them. The American imperialists are using the illegal decision of the Security Council passed in violation of the United Nations Charter to cover up their barbarous acts. They have stained the flag of the United Nations with the blood of the Korean people. The American armed aggression against Korea is a shameful page in the history of the United Nations. The imperialists have exposed their true colors.

　　If there were still people who had illusions about the "humanitarianism" spread by the United States in Korea in the past, today's facts are enough to show what the "humanitarianism" of the American imperialists is and what it means.

　　But American armed aggressors can never use their force to frustrate the Korean people's confidence in victory. On the contrary, it can only further increase the Korean people's hatred of American imperialism. This barbarous atrocity will not only not weaken the strength of the Korean people fighting for freedom and independence, but on the contrary, will strengthen this strength.

　　Q: How does Your Excellency evaluate the international movement of solidarity that is now being carried out throughout the world in support of the Korean people against the armed aggression of American imperialism?

　　A: Progressive mankind all over the world is expressing anger at the American aggression against Korea. We hear the voices of hundreds of millions of people from all over the world calling for "U.S. troops to leave Korea." This great international solidarity encourages the Korean people who are fighting for the freedom and independence of their motherland and gives us new strength.

　　Q: What words does Your Excellency have to convey to the French people?

　　A: In the name of the Korean people, I extend my friendly congratulations to the freedom-loving French people and express my gratitude to the French people for the support they have given to our Korean people in their struggle against the armed aggression of the United States.

　　金日成主席答人道报记者问
    指出：朝鲜人民有坚强的意志，不到把美国侵略者从国土上  完全驱逐出去，并取得最后胜利时，决不停止战斗。
    【新华社平壤三十一日电】从朝鲜前线回到平壤的法国《人道报》记者马尼安，二十七日谒见朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议主席金日成将军，就目前朝鲜战争形势中的若干问题相询。马尼安所提问题及金日成将军的答复如下：
    问：阁下对朝鲜战争开始一个月以来的军事形势如何评价？
    答：朝鲜人民不愿战争，朝鲜的民主力量一贯为我国的和平统一而奋斗。但美帝国主义的走狗——朝鲜反动派发动了同族相争的内战。人民军在汉城缴获的文件，完全证明李承晚军队所发动的战争，是在美国驻汉城军事使团的指使下在很早以前就准备好了的。
    很清楚，美帝国主义者在朝鲜挑起内战，不仅是为了寻找武装侵略朝鲜的借口，而且是为了在亚洲其他地区实行美国的侵略政策，为了实行美国战争贩子军国主义与法西斯化的计划，使业已附属于美国的国家更顺从美帝国主义者。
    至于反人民的李承晚卖国集团挑拨战争的企图，则在于实行美国主子的指示，梦想以战争来解救他们的危机，巩固其日益崩溃的统治。
    美帝国主义者敢于在朝鲜发动战争，是由于过低估计了朝鲜人民的力量。但朝鲜人民军队在全国人民和游击队的积极支持下，仅一个月的战斗，就解放了南朝鲜四分之三的土地，歼灭了李承晚伪军与在朝鲜登陆的大量美军，完全消灭了美军第二十四师，现在胜利地继续前进。
    人民军队在战斗中受到锻炼，积累了战斗经验，将逐渐变为更强大的军队。
    问：阁下认为朝鲜的战争是长期的还是短期的？
    答：假若没有外国的武装干涉，那么，朝鲜的战争早已结束。无疑的，美国的侵略在拖延着战争，我们并不设想很容易地取得胜利。但是，朝鲜人民有坚强的意志，不到把美国侵略者从我们国土上完全驱逐出去，并取得最后胜利时，决不停止我们的战斗。
    问：人民军战胜美帝国主义者武力的原因何在？
    答：人民军的胜利，首先由于他所进行的战争是为了自己祖国的自由独立、反对美国侵略者及其走狗的正义战争。
    人民军的每个官兵都很清楚地认识这一点。体验过长期殖民地生活的朝鲜人民，再不愿作美帝国主义者的奴隶。
    人民军是在全朝鲜人民忠诚不渝的支援与全世界进步人类的同情和声援下进行着斗争的。这一切鼓舞着我们人民军队和全朝鲜人民，向完成英雄伟业之途迈进。
    同时，我们人民军队保有充分的武装力量。这些就是我们人民军队取得胜利的基本原因。但是与此相反，美国军队是为了奴役朝鲜人民，进行着侵略的、非正义的战争。当然，这种战争对美国人民和美国士兵是不需要的。所以他们在朝鲜不能很好地作战，一批一批地被人民军队俘掳或投降，这是不奇怪的。
    问：由于美机轰炸而遭受的损失，是否可能使战争结束受到影响？朝鲜人民对美国侵略者在朝鲜的暴行，怎样看法？
    答：美机疯狂地轰炸朝鲜的城市与农村，屠杀着和平居民，野蛮地蹂躏了一般公认的战争法规。它们轰炸时，从来不针对军事目标，而继续轰炸无防御的城市，残暴地轰炸住宅和建筑物，使居民们失去住处，并无区别地屠杀他们。美帝国主义者以违反联合国宪章而通过的安理会的非法决定，来掩盖着自己的野蛮行为。他们使联合国的旗帜染上了朝鲜人民的鲜血。美国对朝鲜的武装侵犯是联合国历史上可耻的一页。帝国主义者暴露了它们的真面目。
    假如过去还有人对美国在朝鲜传播的“人道主义”有所幻想的话，今天的事实已足够说明美帝国主义者的“人道主义”究竟是什么，并意味着什么。
    但美国武装侵犯者绝不能以自己的武力来挫折朝鲜人民的胜利信心。相反，只能更加增强朝鲜人民对美帝国主义的憎恨。这种野蛮暴行不但不能削弱为了自由、独立而斗争的朝鲜人民的力量，相反地，将加强这种力量。
    问：阁下对现在全世界各国支持朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义武装进攻而展开着的国际性的声援运动，如何评价？
    答：全世界进步的人类，都对美国对朝鲜的侵略行为表示愤怒。我们听到来自全世界各国的亿万人民“要美军离开朝鲜”的呼声。这一伟大的国际声援，鼓舞着为自己祖国的自由独立而斗争的朝鲜人民，给我们增加了新的力量。
    问：阁下对法国人民有什么可传达的话？
    答：我以朝鲜人民的名义，对爱好自由的法国人民，致以友谊的祝贺，并向法国人民对我们朝鲜人民在反对美国武装侵犯者的斗争中所给予我们的声援，表示感谢。
