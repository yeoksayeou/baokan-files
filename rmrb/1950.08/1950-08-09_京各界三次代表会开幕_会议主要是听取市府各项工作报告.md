    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Second Beijing Municipal People's Representatives' Third Conference opened yesterday (August 8th) at 9:00 AM in the Zhongshan Hall in Zhongshan Park. The main agenda of this meeting is to listen to various reports from the Municipal People's Government on the execution of the 1950 work plan, as well as the Consultative Committee's report on relief work for unemployed workers and intellectuals, and the report on convening district-level people's representative conferences.

    The meeting began yesterday with Chairperson Yu Xinqing announcing the agenda. On the agenda, Mayor Nie Rongzhen was the first to give a report to the conference. When Mayor Nie stepped onto the stage, the entire venue erupted in applause, expressing the representatives' warm welcome. Mayor Nie's "Report on the Execution of the 1950 Work Plan" summarized all the work of the Municipal People's Government over the past six months. It included detailed narratives and concise reviews (the full text of the report can be found on pages 1 and 4 of today's newspaper).

    Following this, Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu gave a "Report on Financial and Economic Work," in which he provided specific explanations on the implementation of this year's production guidelines and tasks, the adjustment of industry and commerce, public enterprises, and financial and tax revenue work, covering four issues (the full text of the report can be found on page 5 of tomorrow's newspaper).

    Deputy Mayor Wu Han gave a "Report on the Implementation of the 1950 Cultural, Educational, and Health Work Plan." He first explained that these works were carried out in accordance with the principle of "serving production and serving the working people." Therefore, the focus of his report was on after-school education and social education. The remaining parts covered school education, literary and artistic work, and public health work (the full text of the report can be found on page 5 of tomorrow's newspaper).
  Report on the Explosion at the Fuhua Mining and Pharmaceutical Factory
    The morning meeting concluded with a "Report on the Explosion at the Fuhua Mining and Pharmaceutical Factory" given by Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General of the Municipal People's Government. He gave a summary report on the incident's occurrence and causes, the aftermath work, the review and conclusion of the work, the issues of responsibility and punishment regarding the Fuhua incident, and future measures. Secretary-General Xue seriously and solemnly reviewed the causes of the unfortunate incident: on the one hand, the personnel responsible for production in the 208th Division, which operated the factory, had very serious bureaucratic and purely profit-seeking ideas; on the other hand, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Industry Bureau, and even the Municipal Government itself relaxed control, failed to strictly implement the various management measures for gunpowder manufacturers promulgated by the Municipal Government, and lacked serious inspection. After the incident occurred, responsible comrades from the Municipal People's Government, the North China Military Region, and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China immediately rushed to the scene and organized a temporary command post to carry out rescue operations. More than 2,000 people from the Public Security School, the Municipal Party Committee Training Class, the Public Security Corps, the Fire Brigade, and the 208th Division bravely participated in the rescue work. The injured were sent to various hospitals for treatment. The next day, the Municipal People's Government invited relevant units from the central, North China, and municipal levels to establish the Fuhua Incident Relief Committee, with Municipal Government Secretary-General Xue Zizheng, Deputy Director of the Military Region Political Department Zhang Zhixiang, and Director of the Beijing Suburban Committee Zhou Fengming serving as the director and deputy directors, respectively, to carry out the aftermath relief work and to propose that various agencies donate money for disaster relief. It was decided to open porridge kitchens in the disaster-stricken area, distribute one and a half catties of millet relief grain to each disaster victim every day, and set up tents overnight in the rain to resettle the victims. Seeing the government's concern, the morale of the affected masses gradually stabilized. In addition to the rescue work, the government also concretely resolved the difficulties of the disaster-stricken households, such as issuing 20,000 yuan for each household to purchase temporary utensils, donating more than 2,000 quilts and clothes, and issuing 30,000 yuan in consolation money to each injured person, and digging out clothing for the victims. Central and municipal leaders, such as Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government, Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the State Council, Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court, Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Mayor and Deputy Mayors, constantly went to the scene and various hospitals to express their condolences. In helping disaster-stricken households relocate and repair their houses, the Municipal Government issued a total of 26.65 million yuan for relocation expenses and 131.177 million yuan for resettlement expenses; the 208th Division troops helped the masses repair their houses, doing more than 10,000 workdays in total. A total of 234.93 million yuan was distributed for construction expenses, and 137.51 million yuan was distributed for construction loans. A total of 2,291 houses were built, accounting for 91% of all the houses affected by the disaster. For the disaster-stricken industrial and commercial households, taxes were reduced and exempted by a total of 33.98 million yuan, and severely affected households were subsidized with 250,000 yuan. In addition, small-business loans of 17.1 million yuan were issued. Relief and pensions were given to the families of the deceased, totaling 61,040 catties. As of July 3, a total of 4,053 disaster victims had been rescued, and various relief subsidies totaling 392.761 million yuan had been distributed. Regarding the issue of responsibility and punishment for the Fuhua incident, Secretary-General Xue explained that the Municipal People's Supervision Committee had requested the Central People's Supervision Committee to send personnel to jointly form a joint supervision team for the Fuhua incident, responsible for investigating the truth of the case, pursuing responsibility, and putting forward specific handling opinions. In addition to agreeing with the opinions put forward by the joint supervision team and reporting them to the State Council in detail, the Municipal Government also requested self-punishment. The punishment of the leading cadres of the 208th Division will be decided by the Discipline Inspection Committee of the North China Military Region; the manager, deputy manager, technicians, and other relevant personnel of the Fuhua Mining and Pharmaceutical Factory have been sent to the Beijing Municipal People's Court for handling according to law; for the relevant personnel of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the District Office, and other departments under the Municipal Government, the Municipal Government has formulated demotion, major demerit, serious warning, warning, demerit, criticism, and other punishments according to their positions and responsibilities, and submitted them to the State Council for approval. In addition, the Mayor and Deputy Mayors deeply felt that they had failed in their duties and also requested self-punishment. The announcement will be made after the State Council approves it. The personnel who made efforts to carry out rescue, relief, and medical treatment after the Fuhua incident, such as the Public Security Bureau, the students of the Municipal Party Committee Training Class, the troops of the 208th Division, the Army Hospital, the Municipal Hospital, and the medical personnel of Peking University Hospital, were also commended. In order to prevent the occurrence of explosions and fires in the future, the Municipal Government has decided that all factories in the urban area that manufacture dangerous goods, whether public or private, must be relocated to designated areas in the suburbs within a specified period of time.
  Report on Land Reform in Suburban Areas
    The meeting continued at 3:30 PM, with Chai Zemin, Director of the Municipal Government Suburban Committee, reporting on "Land Reform in Suburban Areas." Land reform in the suburbs began in November last year and was completed in early April this year. The feudal land system has been eliminated, the peasants have been emancipated, and they are actively engaged in production on the land they have been allocated. The land reform work was carried out in three phases, confiscating landlords' land and requisitioning land rented out by rich peasants, totaling 402,885 mu. The land was nationalized and reasonably distributed to landless and land-poor peasants. Landlords without a source of livelihood were also allocated the same share of land as the peasants. A total of 66,804 pieces of landlords' farm tools, 2,279 waterwheels and carts, 1,743 head of draught animals, 1.33 million catties of surplus grain, and 22,278 surplus houses were confiscated. These items were distributed to the peasants according to their needs through a self-reporting and public discussion method. A total of 52,009 households, or 217,091 people, accounting for 62% of the total agricultural population in the suburbs, received land and agricultural production materials. In villages with local despots, the practice was generally to fight against the local despots first and then distribute the land. A total of 130 local despots were struggled against in 66 villages. Among them, 40 major local despots were handed over to the court for handling, and other minor local despots were not pursued after bowing their heads to the masses. Among the 40 major local despots, 7 were sentenced to death, 1 to life imprisonment, 26 to fixed-term imprisonment, and 6 have not yet been processed. Because these local despots owed blood debts and committed crimes such as murder, rape, and seizing houses, the peasants hated them to the bone. After the sentences were handed down, the peasants were overjoyed and said, "The People's Government has eliminated harm for us!" Director Chai pointed out that the smooth completion of land reform in the suburbs was because the "Decision on Agricultural Land Issues in the Municipality" promulgated by the Military Control Commission and the Municipal People's Government in May last year was resolutely implemented, and the resolution passed by the First People's Representative Conference was followed. The middle peasants were united, and industry and commerce were resolutely protected. The self-cultivated land and land cultivated by hired labor of rich peasants were not touched. In addition to land, houses, grain, draught animals, and farm tools, the other property of the landlords was not touched, and the floating assets and hidden assets of the landlords were not pursued. All farms with progressive equipment in the suburbs of Beijing, regardless of whether their land ownership had changed or not, were still operated by the original operators and were not changed. At the same time, full preparations were made before the land reform, and deviations were discovered and corrected in a timely manner during the land reform, so it was carried out relatively smoothly with fewer deviations.
  Report on Relief Work for Unemployed Workers and Unemployed Intellectuals, etc.
    Regarding the relief work for unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals, a report was given by Liu Ren, Vice Chairman of the Consultative Committee. Vice Chairman Liu explained that due to the restoration and development of production, the expansion and increase of public and private industries, the development of overall school education, and the various measures taken by the Municipal People's Government for the unemployed population, the number of unemployed workers, intellectuals, and other unemployed people in Beijing since liberation has been greatly reduced compared with before liberation. However, due to the large number of unemployed people caused by the long-term reactionary rule in the past, the unemployment problem has not yet been completely resolved. Now, according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the "Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers" promulgated by the State Council, six relief plans have been formulated, and the Municipal People's Government has established an Unemployment Workers Relief Committee (full text of the report will be issued separately).
    Qian Duansheng, Vice Chairman of the Consultative Committee, gave a "Report on Convening District-Level People's Representative Conferences." After explaining the process, reflections, and main experiences of convening representative conferences in the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts, Vice Chairman Qian pointed out that district-level people's representative conferences should be universally promoted throughout the city. He said: "Some districts have as many as 2,700 proposals, and this ironclad fact proves that it is very necessary to convene district-level people's representative conferences." He further explained: "Judging from the results produced and the reactions obtained from this meeting, in a large city like Beijing, a district has one to two hundred thousand people, and the demands and opinions put forward by the people at the district representative conference are so many, it is very necessary to hold such a meeting. This can not only gather more people's opinions and strengthen the connection between the government and the people, enabling the people to assist the government in handling affairs, thereby making the government's policies and plans easier to implement, but also enable the government and cadres to receive the supervision and criticism of the people, thereby quickly overcoming many shortcomings in the work and improving work efficiency. This not only strengthens the cadres' sense of responsibility to the people and their concept of serving the people, but also gives a great blow to bureaucracy and commandism. At the same time, it also makes it easier for the people to quickly improve their awareness as masters of the country from the experience of actual democratic life."
    In addition to the above reports, the Municipal Government also submitted four written reports to the conference on "The Aftermath of Closing Brothels," "Municipal Construction Work," "The Municipal People's Court's Clearance of Backlogged Cases," and "The Beijing Municipal People's Government's Report on the Implementation of the Resolutions of the Second People's Representatives' Second Conference."
    The conference adjourned yesterday in warm applause after passing the "List of Government Work Report Review Committee" and the "List of Proposal Review Committee."
    The conference will be adjourned today for group discussions, and the conference will continue tomorrow to discuss and pass the Municipal Government's work report and listen to and pass the Proposal Review Committee's report on review opinions.

　　京各界三次代表会开幕
    会议主要是听取市府各项工作报告
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：北京市第二届第三次各界人民代表会议昨（八）日上午九时在中山公园中山堂开幕。这次会议的主要议程是听取市人民政府执行一九五○年度工作计划的各项报告，和协商委员会关于失业工人和失业知识分子救济工作的报告及关于召开区各界人民代表会议的报告。会期预计三日。昨日出席代表三百三十四人，执行主席上午为彭真、余心清、陈垣、李伯钊、诸福棠、浦洁修、黎锦熙、许立群、朱长江；下午为刘仁、许德珩、徐悲鸿、何凤亭、古奇踪、梁以俅、刘一峰、萧松、柴泽民。

  关于辅华矿药厂爆炸事件的报告
    上午会议最后听取市人民政府秘书长薛子正“关于辅华矿药厂爆炸事件的报告”，他就事件发生的经过和原因，善后工作，复查与结束工作，关于辅华事件的责任和处分问题及今后措施作择要的报告。薛秘书长认真严肃的检讨了发生不幸事件的原因：一方面是经营该厂的二○八师负责机关生产的人员有很严重的官僚主义和单纯营利思想；另一方面，市公安局、工业局乃至市府本身放松了管制，没有严格地执行市政府所颁布的各项火药厂商管理办法，并缺乏认真的检查。事件发生后，市人民政府、华北军区及中共北京市委会负责同志都立即赶到现场，组织临时指挥部，进行抢救。公安学校、市委干训班、公安总队、消防队、二○八师等二千余人奋勇参加抢救工作。并将伤者分送各医院治疗。次日，即由市人民政府约请中央、华北及市级有关单位，成立辅华事件救济委员会，由市府秘书长薛子正、军区政治部副主任张致祥、北京市郊委会主任周凤鸣分任正副主任委员，进行善后救济工作，建议各机关募捐救灾。并决定在被灾区开设粥厂，发给被灾者每人每日一斤半小米救济粮，连夜冒雨赶搭帐篷，安置灾民。被灾群众，看到政府这样关心，情绪逐渐稳定。除抢救工作以外，政府并进行了具体解决灾户困难，如发给临时购买用具费每户二万元，捐助二千多条被子和衣服，发放受伤者每人慰问费三万元，替灾民挖掘衣物。中央及市级首长，如：中央人民政府秘书长林伯渠、政务院副总理郭沫若、最高人民法院院长沈钧儒、中共北京市委书记彭真及市长副市长等都不断地亲赴现场及各医院慰问，在帮助灾户迁居，帮助灾户修复住房方面，市府共发迁移费二千六百六十五万元，安置费一亿三千一百十七万七千元；二○八师部队帮助群众修房，前后做了一万多工。总计发放修建费二亿三千四百九十三万余元，发放修建贷款一亿三千七百五十一万余元，修建房屋共二千二百九十一间，为全部受灾房屋的百分之九十一。对被灾的工商业户，则减免税款共计三千三百九十八万余元，对重灾户补助二十五万元，此外发放小本贷款一千七百一十万元。对死者家属分别给予救济与抚恤，共计六万一千零四十斤。到七月三日止，共救济了灾民四千零五十三人，共发放各种救济补助款项三亿九千二百七十六万一千元。关于辅华事件的责任和处分问题，薛秘书长说明：市人民监察委员会曾请中央人民监察委员会派员共同组成辅华事件联合监察组，负责调查案情真象，追究责任，提出了具体处理意见。市府除同意联合监察组所提意见，详报政务院之外，并自请处分。二○八师各领导干部的处分，由华北军区纪律检查委员会决定；辅华矿药厂经理、副经理、技师等有关人员已送北京市人民法院依法处理；市公安局、区公所等市府所属各部门有关人员，市府已按职务与责任轻重分别拟定撤职、记大过、严重警告、警告、记过、批评等处分，呈请政务院核示。此外，市长、副市长，深感有忝职责，亦自请处分。待政务院批示后即可公布。对辅华事件发生后，努力进行抢救，救济，救护等善后工作的人员，如公安局、市委干训班学员、二○八师部队、陆军医院、市立医院、北大医院医务人员等，也进行了表扬。为了防止以后爆炸燃烧事件的发生，市政府已决定对市区一切制造危险物品的工厂，不论公营私营，一律限期迁往郊外指定的地区。
  关于郊区土地改革工作的报告
    下午三时半继续开会，由市府郊委会主任柴泽民报告“郊区土地改革工作”。郊区土地改革，从去年十一月开始，到今年四月初完成，封建土地制度已经消灭，农民已经翻身，并在自己分得的土地上积极地进入了生产。土地改革工作分三期进行，共没收地主的土地和征收富农出租的土地四十万二千八百八十五亩。土地收归国有，合理地分配给无地少地的农民使用，无生活来源的地主亦分得与农民同样的一份土地。没收地主农具六万六千八百零四件，水车和大车两千二百七十九辆，耕畜一千七百四十三头，多余粮食一百三十三万斤，和多余房屋二万二千二百七十八间。这些东西，根据农民的需要，采取自报公议方式，分给了农民。计分得土地和农具等生产资料的农民共五万二千零九户，二十一万七千零九十一人，占全郊区农业人口百分之六十二。凡是有恶霸的村庄，一般都是先反恶霸，然后分地，先后在六十六个村一共斗争了一百三十名恶霸。其中四十名大恶霸，交法院处理，其它小恶霸向群众低头后，即不予追究。在四十名大恶霸中，判处死刑者七名，无期徒刑者一名，有期徒刑者二十六名，尚未处理者六名。因为这些恶霸，血债如山，犯了杀人、强奸、霸占房屋等罪行，农民恨之入骨。判处之后，农民皆大欢喜，说：“人民政府可给咱们除害了！”郊区土地改革的顺利完成，柴主任指出：这是因为坚决执行了军管会和市人民政府去年五月所颁布的“关于本市辖区农业土地问题的决定”，并根据第一届人民代表会议所通过的决议，团结了中农，坚决地保护了工商业，不动富农自耕和雇人耕种的土地。除土地、房屋、粮食、耕畜、农具外，不动地主的其它财产，不追地主浮财、底财、所有京郊有进步设备的农场，无论其土地所有权已否变动，均仍由原经营者继续经营，不予变动。同时，在土地改革前作了充分的准备，土地改革中又及时发现与纠正了偏向，所以进行得比较顺利而偏差较少。
  关于失业工人和失业知识分子救济工作等的报告
    关于失业工人和失业知识分子救济工作，由协商委员会副主席刘仁作报告。刘副主席说明：由于生产的恢复和发展，公私工业的扩大和增加，整个学校教育的发展以及市人民政府对失业人口所采取的各项措施，解放以来，北京市的失业工人，知识分子及其它失业人口，较之解放前大为减少。但是，由于过去长期的反动统治所造成的失业人口的数量很大，因此，失业问题还没有获得完全解决。现在，根据毛主席的指示，和政务院所颁布的“救济失业工人的暂行办法”，拟定了六项救济方案，并由市人民政府成立失业工人救济委员会（报告全文另发）。
    协商委员会副主席钱端升作“关于召开区各界人民代表会议的报告”。钱副主席把第一、五、六、七等四个区召开代表会议的经过，反映和主要经验说明之后，指出区各界人民代表会议应该在全市普遍推行。他说：“有的区提案竟达两千七百余件之多，这一铁的事实证明，召开区各界人民代表会议是十分必要的。”他进一步说明：“从这个会议所产生的结果和所得到的反应来看，在北京这样的大城市，一个区有一二十万人口，人民在区代表会议上提出的要求和意见这样多，开这样的会议是很有必要的。这样不仅可以更多地集中人民的意见，更密切政府和人民的联系，使人民来协助政府办事，因而使政府的方针和计划更容易贯彻，并且使政府和干部都得到人民的监督与批评，因而迅速克服了很多工作中的缺点，提高了工作的效能。这样不仅加强了干部对人民负责，为人民服务的观点，给官僚主义和命令主义以很大打击。同时，也更易使人民从实际的民主生活体验中迅速提高主人翁的自觉。”
    昨日会议除以上报告外，市政府并向大会提出了关于“封闭妓院的善后工作”，“市政建设工作”，以及“市人民法院清理积案工作”，以及“京市人民政府执行第二届第二次各界人民代表会议决议案报告表”等四个书面报告。
    昨日大会最后于通过了“政府工作报告审查委员会名单”与“提案审查委员会名单”后，在热烈的掌声中休会。
    今日大会休会，进行小组讨论，明日继续举行大会，讨论与通过市政府的工作报告，听取与通过提案审查委员会审查意见的报告。
