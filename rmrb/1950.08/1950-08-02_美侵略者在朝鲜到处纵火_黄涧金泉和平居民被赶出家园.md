Xinhua News Agency, 1st.—American aggressor troops in Korea are implementing a savage scorched earth policy. According to United Press reporter Carishel from the Korean front on July 31, the U.S. First Cavalry Division has adopted a so-called "scorched earth policy" within its war zone and, under the pretext of "eliminating guerrilla hiding places," has begun burning villages within the U.S. defense line. It is claimed that "the Hwanggan and Gimcheon areas are filled with smoke and flames," and peaceful residents have been driven from their homes by the U.S. military. According to the reporter, "More villages will be burned in the future."
