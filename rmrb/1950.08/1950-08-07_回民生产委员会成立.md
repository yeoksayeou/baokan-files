　　Establishment of the Hui People's Production Committee
    [From Our Newspaper] The former Islamic Association Credit Cooperative has been reorganized into the Beijing Hui People's Production Cooperative, and a production committee has been established to begin organizing planned production. During the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the credit cooperative sponsored by the former Islamic Association was controlled by a few responsible persons, and the vast number of cooperative members did not receive any benefit. After the liberation of Beijing, the cooperative members formed groups, elected representatives, and established a liquidation committee to seize some houses and properties from the person in charge of the cooperative as compensation for shares. They also elected 11 members, including Ping Bozhai and Yang Shaopu, to form a production committee responsible for organizing and leading the future production undertakings of the Hui people.

　　回民生产委员会成立
    【本报讯】前回教协会信用合作社已经改组为北京市回民生产合作社，并成立了生产委员会，开始组织计划生产。在国民党反动统治时期，前回教协会主办的信用合作社，由于少数负责人把持，广大社员并没有得到丝毫好处。北京解放后，社员组成小组，选出代表，成立清理委员会，向该社负责人清出一部房屋财产，作为赔偿股金。并选出平博斋、杨少圃等委员十一人，组成生产委员会，负责组织领导今后的回民生产事业。（马务本）
