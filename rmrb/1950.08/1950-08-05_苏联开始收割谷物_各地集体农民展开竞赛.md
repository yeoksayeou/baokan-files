Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: Comprehensive reports from TASS: The Soviet Union has begun harvesting crops in Siberia, the central regions, and Estonia.

Collective farms in the Altai Territory, Irkutsk, Omsk, and Chita regions have started harvesting winter rye and spring wheat. The collective farms of Siberia received 17.6% more agricultural machinery this year than last year, and 70% of the total harvesting work this year will be carried out using combines.

Rice paddies in Kursk and Voronezh and other places have already turned golden. People have always believed that this area is not suitable for growing rice, but the construction of irrigation projects and the cultivation of early-maturing rice varieties that do not require a lot of water have led to a bumper rice harvest. It is estimated that the yield this year will be 30 to 35 centners per hectare (approximately 400 to 460 jin per mu).

Estonia's agricultural machinery has doubled, and more than 100 collective farms have begun using electric threshing, which will complete the harvest ten days earlier than last year.

Collective farmers and tractor drivers everywhere are working joyfully and in an organized manner. They are launching a socialist competition in order to hand over grain to the state early.

Due to the good grain harvest, many collective farms in Ukraine have paid the collective farmers in advance based on workdays. They have received more grain this year than in the past. For example, in the Zhovten Collective Farm in the Tarno-e district of Kiev Oblast, the villagers received 2.5 kilograms of grain for each workday unit last year; and this year, the grain prepaid to them alone includes 2 kilograms of high-quality wheat. Many collective farmers' families have accumulated one ton or one and a half tons of grain.

　　苏联开始收割谷物
    各地集体农民展开竞赛
    【新华社三日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联西伯利亚、中部地区以及爱沙尼亚等处现已开始收获农作物。
    阿尔泰边疆区、伊尔库茨克、鄂木斯克及赤塔等州的集体农场，现已开始收割冬季裸麦和春季小麦。西伯利亚各集体农场今年获得的农业机器，比去年增加了百分之十七点六，今年全部收割工作的百分之七十将使用联合机进行。
    库尔斯克及佛罗内兹等地的稻田已经一片金黄。人们一向认为这个地区不宜种稻，但灌溉工程的建设和培育不需大量水分的早熟稻种，却已使稻田获得丰收。估计今年每公顷可收获三十到三十五生丁纳（约合每市亩收获四百市斤至四百六十市斤）。
    爱沙尼亚的农业机器已增加了一倍，有一百多个集体农场已开始使用电力打谷，这将使收割工作较去年提早十天完成。
    各处的集体农民及拖拉机驾驶员们，都在欢快而有组织地进行工作。他们正展开社会主义竞赛，以期提早把谷物交纳给国家。
    由于谷物收成良好，乌克兰的许多集体农庄现已把以工作日为单位的劳动报酬，先期支付给集体农民。他们今年得到的谷物比过去为多。例如，在基辅州塔尔诺埃区的日夫特尼亚集体农庄，庄员去年每一工作单位得二公斤半的谷物；而今年，单是预付给他们的谷物，就有二公斤的上等小麦。许多集体农民的家庭，已积蓄了一吨或一吨半的谷物。
