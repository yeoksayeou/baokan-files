　　People of All Nationalities Resolutely Unite and Strive to Defeat the American Aggressors

　　[By Our Own Correspondent] The facts of American aggression against Taiwan and Korea have aroused the anger of people of all nationalities in our country. People of various ethnic groups in Beijing have met with our reporters or written to our newspaper to express their views, unanimously condemning the American aggression and expressing the determination of all nationalities to liberate Taiwan, and enthusiastically supporting the Korean people's war of liberation.

　　Mongolian Representatives
　　Mongolian representatives unanimously stated: Mongolian compatriots will unite closely with the people of the whole country and the people of the world to crush any aggressive schemes of American imperialism. Peng Sike, Deputy Director of the General Office of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, said: "The American aggressors' bandit-like attack on the Korean people has been met with a powerful blow by the Korean people. Now, the Korean People's Army is eliminating American aggressors by the hundreds and thousands. Facts prove that the Korean people's will to fight for independence, unification, and democracy has become an unstoppable torrent, and the American imperialists' arrogant attempt at aggression is bound to be crushed. The American armed intervention in Taiwan fully proves that its aggressive ambitions against the Chinese people have not died, and it is trying to help Chiang Kai-shek's remaining bandits invade our mainland. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of all nationalities in our country must liberate Taiwan one hundred percent." Finally, he said: "In the past, our Inner Mongolian people expelled the reactionary ruling forces of the American imperialist running dog, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang. Now we are closely watching the destructive activities of American and Chiang Kai-shek's special agents in Inner Mongolia. After hearing the news of American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, people in various parts of Inner Mongolia have held meetings to publicize the crimes of the American imperialists. Workers in various factories have requested information on the war situation in Korea. The movement to support the Korean people has been launched enthusiastically in various banners and counties."

　　Guan Bao, Director of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government's office in Beijing, said: "The people of Inner Mongolia have suffered long-term and cruel oppression from the Kuomintang reactionaries, but we have been liberated through our own resolute resistance and the strong support of all nationalities. The Korean people have suffered from oppression under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism for half a century, and their will to fight for independence and freedom must be extremely strong. This just struggle has received enthusiastic support from the people of the world, which gives them more confidence in their struggle. The people of Inner Mongolia pledge to support them with the greatest strength."

　　Uli Xielietu, Deputy League Leader of the Hulunbuir League, and Bao Zhongnai, Deputy League Leader of the Jirem League, who came to Beijing from Inner Mongolia last month for study, said that when they left Inner Mongolia, peace signature campaigns were being launched in various parts of Inner Mongolia, and the people of Inner Mongolia enthusiastically participated in this signature campaign. After arriving in Beijing and seeing the news of American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, they immediately made comfort bags and wrote comfort letters to the soldiers of the Korean People's Army. They put the paintings "Twenty-Five Thousand Li Long March" and "Million Soldiers Crossing the Yangtze River" in the comfort bags, introducing the experience of the Chinese people's struggle for victory to the Korean brothers and encouraging them to bravely eliminate the enemy. In their conversations, they unanimously pointed out that the American armed intervention in Taiwan and Korea has further exposed its true face of aggression against the people of the world. The American failure in Korea fully exposed the weakness of American imperialist forces, and also proved that the power of the people is strong. The result of American aggression against Korea is like this, and it will be the same when it invades Taiwan, Vietnam, and the Philippines. The paper tiger cannot stop the power of people's liberation, and victory must belong to the people.

　　Hui Representatives
　　Ma Yuhuai, President of the Hui People's Academy, summarized the Hui people's opinions on opposing American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, saying: "The Hui people have never succumbed to domestic reactionary rule in past dynasties, no matter how strong or weak the enemy was. We know that oppressed nations will never surrender to their oppressors. And they will surely be able to achieve victory. The Korean people have suffered oppression for half a century and have never yielded. This time, their struggle against American imperialism for national independence and freedom will surely be victorious. The struggle against American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea is consistent. American imperialism is our common enemy. We must not only liberate Taiwan, but also vigorously support the liberation movements of the Korean people and other oppressed nations in Asia in order to safeguard world peace."

　　Uyghur Representatives
　　Uyghur representative Mutieyi said that from the recent Uyghur and Chinese language newspapers from Dihua (Ürümqi), he saw that people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang expressed their firm opposition to American aggression, and the peace signature campaign in Xinjiang has become even more enthusiastic and widespread. He said: "American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang have been obstructing the liberation struggle of the Xinjiang people for many years. After liberation, American imperialism directed its running dogs in Xinjiang, Usman, Yaolebos, and Janim Khan, and other reactionary armed forces, to carry out disturbances in various parts of Xinjiang; but this reactionary armed force has recently been crushed by the People's Liberation Army and the people of Xinjiang. From this incident, the people of Xinjiang have seen how strong the American imperialist running dogs are, and how strong the puppet Li Seung-man of South Korea is. American imperialism and its running dogs, who recklessly launched a war of aggression, are bound to suffer a fatal blow from the people's forces."

　　Tibetan Representatives
　　Duojie Caidan (Tibetan), alternate representative of domestic minority nationalities in the People's Political Consultative Conference, said: "Today, the people of the whole world have stood up one after another. The more isolated the imperialists become, the more they fantasize about finding a way out in war, but the result will inevitably be crushed by the powerful forces of the people. How strong the American imperialist paper tiger is, the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique it supports is a good proof. Now, the situation of the American army and the Li Seung-man bandit army fleeing in disarray in Korea is another proof. The United States is carrying out aggression under the guise of the United Nations and using Lie to collect cannon fodder for it, but the American army in Korea is still suffering repeated defeats, which proves that the power of the people is invincible. We people of all nationalities are determined to liberate Taiwan, Tibet, and any corner of China. There is no place for imperialists to stand on the land of the people."

　　Miao Representatives
　　Zhu Zaoguan (Miao), representative of domestic minority nationalities in the People's Political Consultative Conference and member of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, wrote a letter to our newspaper, saying: "We Miao people have suffered from the persecution of domestic reactionary forces and foreign imperialism for a long time. Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we have stood up and become masters of our own destiny. Therefore, we love our country and wholeheartedly support the people's democratic regime; at the same time, we have a deep hatred and determination to resist any imperialist robbers who invade our territory.

　　No matter how crazy the American imperialists are, we must liberate Taiwan and support the Korean people's war of liberation. We are people who have stood up. We have established our own country under very difficult circumstances. Therefore, we have full confidence in defending our motherland today. Since the American imperialists want to provoke the Chinese and Korean people and disrupt world peace, we and the people of the whole world must hold them accountable for their actions and make them receive the punishment and lessons they deserve."

　　Miao and Yi Youth
　　All Miao and Yi youth in Beijing expressed their extreme anger at the American imperialists' atrocities of invading Taiwan and Korea. They wrote a letter to our newspaper on July 22, saying: "We, all the Miao and Yi youth in Beijing, deeply hate the aggressive atrocities of the United States. In addition to enthusiastically joining the movement against American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, we will also call on our compatriots to step up production, support the front line, and liberate the people of all nationalities in Taiwan. At the same time, we support the just struggle of the Korean people for the unification of their motherland and their own liberation.

　　We Miao and Yi compatriots, like the progressive people of the world, love peace and democracy, but in history we have been oppressed and enslaved. Today we have been liberated, and we are determined to defend the fruits of victory to the death, unite with all the peace-loving people of the world, and fight to crush the American imperialists' aggression against Taiwan and Korea!"

　　Mongolian-Tibetan School
　　All teachers and students of the National Mongolian-Tibetan School expressed great anger at the American imperialists' aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and at the same time expressed sincere admiration and support for the Korean people who bravely resisted the aggressors and dealt them a serious blow. The students expressed their great confidence in our liberation of Taiwan and the victory of the Korean people in expelling the invaders on their bulletin boards. Huang Jingtao, the principal of the Mongolian-Tibetan School, said: "The American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea does not indicate its strength, but its weakness. The war in Korea has exposed this paper tiger. The Chinese people have rich combat experience and are fully capable of liberating Taiwan. Victory will surely belong to the Korean people and us." Zhao Lianke and Bai Yintai, two Mongolian teachers, also expressed their firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement from the standpoint of the people of Inner Mongolia, opposing American imperialist aggression and supporting the liberation of Taiwan and the struggle of the Korean people.

　　Hui People's Academy
　　In addition to holding forums and expressing opinions on bulletin boards, the students of the National Hui People's Academy formed a propaganda team to cooperate with the propaganda activities of the Eighth District Government to conduct street propaganda in Hui-populated areas and other areas.

　　On July 20, all the students of the academy wrote a letter to their young friends in Korea, expressing their admiration for the Korean youth who bravely participated in the war of liberation of their motherland, and the Chinese Hui youth will support the Korean people's war of liberation with unparalleled enthusiasm.

　　各民族人民坚决团结一致
    为打败美国侵略者而奋斗
    【本报讯】美国侵略台湾、朝鲜的事实，已引起我国各民族人民的愤怒。在北京的各族人士，分别接见本报记者或写信给本报发表谈话，一致斥责美国侵略罪行，表示各族人民对解放台湾的决心，并以无限热情声援朝鲜人民解放战争。
    蒙族人士
    蒙族人士一致表示：蒙族同胞将与全国人民以及全世界人民紧密团结，粉碎美帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋。民族事务委员会办公厅副主任朋斯克说：“美国侵略者对朝鲜人民的强盗式的进攻，已遭受朝鲜人民有力的打击。现在，朝鲜人民军正成千成百地消灭美国侵略军。事实证明：朝鲜人民为独立、统一和民主而斗争的意志，已汇成为不可遏阻的巨流，美帝国主义者侵略的狂妄的企图是必然要被粉碎的。美国对台湾的武装干涉，充分证明它对中国人民的侵略野心未死，妄图援助蒋介石残余匪帮进犯我国大陆。我国各族人民在毛主席的领导下，一定要百分之百地解放台湾。”最后他说：“过去我们内蒙人民曾驱逐了美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮的反动统治势力，现在我们密切地注意美蒋特务在内蒙的破坏活动。内蒙人民听到美国侵略台湾、朝鲜的消息后，各地纷纷开会宣传美帝国主义者的罪行，各工厂工人要求介绍朝鲜的战况；支援朝鲜人民的运动，已在各旗县热烈展开。”
    内蒙自治政府驻北京办事处处长官宝说：“内蒙人民曾受过国民党反动派长期的残酷压迫，但是我们靠着自己的坚决反抗以及各民族的有力支援，已获得解放。朝鲜人民半世纪以来，在日本帝国主义铁蹄下受尽被压迫之苦，他们争取独立自由的意志必然是极坚强的。这一正义斗争已获得全世界的人民的热烈声援，使他们的奋斗更有信心。朝鲜人民是一定可以取得胜利的。内蒙人民誓以最大力量予以支援。”
    上月由内蒙来京学习的呼纳盟副盟长乌力谢勒图和哲盟副盟长包仲乃说他们来时内蒙各地正展开和平签名运动，内蒙人民热烈参加这个签名运动。来京后看到美国侵略台湾、朝鲜的消息，他们立刻做慰劳袋、写慰劳信给朝鲜人民军的战士，在慰劳袋内装了“二万五千里长征”和“百万雄师下江南”的图画，把中国人民斗争胜利的经验介绍给朝鲜的兄弟，鼓励他们勇敢地消灭敌人。他们在谈话中一致指出，美国武装干涉台湾、朝鲜，更暴露了它对全世界人民侵略的真实面目。美国在朝鲜遭受失败，充分暴露了美帝国主义力量的脆弱，同时也证明了人民的力量是强大的；美国侵略朝鲜的结果如此，在侵略台湾、越南和菲律宾时也将如此，纸老虎决阻止不住人民解放的力量，胜利一定是属于人民的。
    回族人士
    回民学院马玉槐院长归纳回民对反对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜的意见说：“回民对国内历代反动统治，不论是强大或脆弱的敌人，从未屈服过。我们知道被压迫的民族是永远不会向压迫者屈服的。而且必然能够取得胜利。朝鲜人民半世纪以来受尽压迫，从来未屈服过，这一次为争取民族独立自由而进行反对美国帝国主义的斗争，是一定能胜利的。反对美帝侵略台湾和朝鲜的斗争是一致的，美国帝国主义是我们共同的敌人，我们不但一定要解放台湾，而且必须大力支援朝鲜人民及其他亚洲各被压迫民族的解放运动，才能保障世界的和平。”
    维族人士
    维吾尔族人士木铁意说，他从最近收到的迪化的哈文、维文报纸看到，新疆各族人民对美国的侵略行为，表示坚决的反对，新疆各地的和平签名运动，也因此更加热烈和扩展。他说：“美帝国主义和国民党匪帮，多少年来都在阻挠新疆人民的解放斗争。解放后，美帝国主义指挥其在新疆的走狗乌斯满、尧乐博斯和贾尼木汗等的反动武装，在新疆各地进行扰乱；但是这支反动武装最近已被人民解放军和新疆人民打垮。新疆人民从这件事上已经看到美帝国主义走狗们的力量有多大，南朝鲜傀儡李承晚的力量有多大。冒险发动侵略战争的美帝国主义及其走狗，一定要遭到人民力量的致命的打击。”
    藏族人士
    人民政协国内少数民族候补代表多杰才旦（藏族）说：“今天，全世界人民已经先后地站起来了，帝国主义者愈显孤立，他们就愈妄想在战争中找出路，但是，结果必然要为强大的人民力量所粉碎。美帝国主义这只纸老虎的力量有多大，他所支持的蒋介石反动派的垮台就是很好的证明，现在，美军和李承晚匪军在朝鲜狼狈奔逃的情形，又是一个证明。美国假借联合国的名义进行侵略，并利用赖伊为其搜罗炮灰，但是美军在朝鲜依然是连吃败仗，这证明人民的力量是不可战胜的。我们各族人民，坚决要解放台湾、西藏和中国的任何角落，人民的土地上是没有帝国主义者立足之地的。”
    苗族人士
    人民政协国内少数民族代表、民族事务委员会委员朱早观（苗族）写信给本报，信中说：“我们苗族，过去长期遭受国内反动势力和国外帝国主义的迫害，现在在中国共产党的领导下，翻身做了主人。因此，我们热爱我们的国家，衷心拥护人民民主政权；同时，对于侵略我们国土的任何帝国主义强盗，有着深刻的愤恨和反抗的决心。
    不管美帝国主义者怎样疯狂，我们一定要解放台湾，并支援朝鲜人民解放战争。我们是已经站起来的人民，我们曾在非常困难的情形下建立了人民自己的国家，因此，我们今天对于保卫自己的祖国有着充分的信心。美帝国主义者既然要来向中国人民和朝鲜人民挑衅，破坏世界和平，我们以及全世界的人民，就一定要使它对自己的行为负责，而受到应有的惩罚和教训。”
    苗彝青年
    旅京全体苗彝青年对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜的暴行，表示万分愤怒。特于七月二十二日写信给本报说：“我们在京的全体苗彝青年，对美国的侵略暴行，真是深恶痛绝。我们除了热烈地加入反对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜运动外，还要号召我们的同胞加紧生产，支援前线，解放台湾各族人民。同时，我们声援朝鲜人民为了祖国的统一及自己的解放而进行的正义斗争。
    我们苗族彝族的同胞像全世界进步人类一样的酷爱和平民主，但是在历史上我们却是受压迫和被奴役的。今天我们已获得了解放，我们决誓死保卫胜利的果实，与全世界爱好和平的各族人民团结一致，为粉碎美帝对台湾和朝鲜的侵略而奋斗！”
    蒙藏学校
    国立蒙藏学校的全体师生，对美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜，表示极大的愤怒，同时对于英勇抗战予侵略者以严重打击的朝鲜人民，则表示衷心的钦佩与支援。同学们在他们的壁报上表示对于我们解放台湾和朝鲜人民驱逐侵略者的胜利，抱有极大的信心。蒙藏学校黄静涛校长说：“美帝对台湾与朝鲜的侵略，不是表示其力量的强大，而是表示其力量的脆弱。朝鲜的战事已把这纸老虎拆穿。中国人民有丰富战斗经验，是有充分的力量解放台湾的，胜利必然属于朝鲜人民与我们。”赵连科、白荫泰两位蒙文教员也表示站在内蒙人民的立场，坚决拥护周外长的声明，反对美帝侵略，支援解放台湾与朝鲜人民的斗争。
    回民学院
    国立回民学院的学生除了召开座谈会及在壁报上表示意见外，并组成宣传队，配合第八区政府宣传活动到回民聚集区及其他地区从事街头宣传。
    该院全体同学于七月二十日写信给朝鲜的青年朋友，对朝鲜青年英勇地参加祖国解放战争，表示钦佩，中国的回民青年将以无比的热情支持朝鲜人民解放战争。
