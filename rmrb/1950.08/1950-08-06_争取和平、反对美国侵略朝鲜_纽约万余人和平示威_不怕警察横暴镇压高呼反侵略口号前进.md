Xinhua News Agency, Dispatch from New York, August 5th: Despite the New York Labor Peace Conference-sponsored demonstration scheduled for August 2nd being banned, 15,000 peace advocates in New York still held a peace demonstration in Union Square. The demonstration was carried out under the slogans of striving for peace and opposing US intervention in Korea. The peaceful demonstrators were not afraid of intimidation; even when the police charged into their ranks on horseback, using clubs to beat and attempt to disperse the crowd, they continued to advance, shouting "We want peace" and "Ban the atomic bomb." Although the demonstration was originally scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM New York time, Union Square, the surrounding streets, and Grand Central Station were filled with increasing numbers of police forces from 3:00 PM onwards. The actual demonstration began just after 6:00 PM, with marchers holding up signs with slogans such as: "End the Korean War," "Keep America Free—No Police State." They shouted: "We want peace." The police immediately rushed into the crowd, indiscriminately beating nearby victims with fists and clubs. The Worker's Daily, in reporting on this demonstration and the attempt to disperse it, expressed indignation at the American police terror.

　　争取和平、反对美国侵略朝鲜
    纽约万余人和平示威
    不怕警察横暴镇压高呼反侵略口号前进
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社纽约三日讯，尽管纽约劳工和平会议主催的定于八月二日举行的示威遭到禁止，纽约和平拥护者一万五千人，仍在联合广场举行了和平示威。示威在争取和平、反对美国干涉朝鲜的口号下进行。和平示威者不怕恫吓；甚至在警察骑马冲进他们的队伍，用棍棒殴打企图驱散群众的时候，他们还是继续前进，高呼“我们要和平”，“禁止原子弹”。虽然示威原定在纽约时间七时开始，但联合广场和周围的街道上以及都会车站上，从三时起就布满了越来越多的警察部队。实际示威从六时刚过开始，游行者高举着标语牌，上面写着：“结束朝鲜战争”，“保持美国自由——不要警察国家”。他们高呼：“我们要和平”。警察立刻冲进人群中，用拳头棍棒不分皂白地殴打就近的受难者。工人日报在报道这次示威与驱散这一示威的企图时，对美国的警察恐怖表示愤慨。
