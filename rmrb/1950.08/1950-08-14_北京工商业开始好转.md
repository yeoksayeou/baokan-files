Beijing's Industry and Commerce Begin to Improve
　　Wang Jing
    The stability of prices has further created favorable conditions for the restoration and development of production. Although private industry and commerce in Beijing have experienced unavoidable difficulties in the process of economic restructuring, they have begun to move towards a normal path forward under the support and leadership of the People's Government.

    I. Price Stability Brings "Pain" and "New Life"

    Since the Central People's Government implemented measures to unify national finance and economy in March this year, the trend of rising prices over the past decade has been reversed. However, in the beginning, due to the loss of speculative conditions, the sudden disappearance of false purchasing power, and the change in people's thinking from valuing goods over currency, merchants competed to sell off goods, resulting in a general stagnation of goods in the market, which put industry and commerce in temporary difficulty and pain.

    Based on the instructions of the Central Government and the actual situation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has taken many measures to help private industry and commerce overcome the current difficulties. First, when prices fell sharply, state-owned trade departments kept list prices higher than market prices for a long time to stabilize them at a certain level, which facilitated industrial and commercial turnover and reduced losses from sharp price declines. Comparing the list prices of state-owned companies with market prices for eight major commodities, including standard flour, Northeast corn, millet, sorghum rice, Wufu cloth, Danfeng matches, Hengda cigarettes, and Triangle soda ash, from late March to the end of May, the average list price was 5.4% higher than the market price. Among them, millet was as high as 16.7% higher than the market price. At the same time, state-owned trading companies also put money into the market and purchased some of the slow-moving goods. In April and May alone, more than 30 billion yuan was invested. These two tasks played a great role in stabilizing prices. By mid-April, prices stopped falling. For three months, the prices of daily necessities have remained stable. The general price index was 156.9 in mid-April, 145.8 in mid-June, and 160.2 in mid-July, with very little change. (The general price index takes December 1949 as the base period, with a total of 26 major commodities.)

    Due to stable prices, the market situation gradually returned to normal. The total transaction volume of flour in the Grain Exchange in March was 89,335 bags, accounting for only 15% of the total listed volume of 590,667 bags (according to the flour transaction volume on one day in November 1949 when prices fluctuated, the highest reached 10,000 bags). By June, the situation had changed, and the total transaction volume of flour was 138,997 bags, accounting for 30% of the total listed volume of 471,235 bags. The listed volume decreased by 20% compared with March, while the transaction volume increased by 55%. Similarly, the transaction volume of cotton cloth also increased month by month. The total transaction volume of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange in March was 21,747 bolts, which increased to 56,734 bolts in May, an increase of 160%. From this, it can be seen that after more than three months of stable prices, most of the stockpiled goods have been sold, and the relationship between supply and demand is gradually returning to normal. At the same time, due to the stability of prices throughout the country, the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has also improved significantly. According to statistics from Beijing Railway Station, the amount of private grain input in April increased by 55% compared with March, and increased by 65% in May compared with April. In June, it decreased by 26% compared with May due to rain and busy farming season. The number of cotton cloths sold to Chahar-Suiyuan, Central Hebei, and Eastern Hebei and other places has increased sharply. In March, it was only more than 4,000 bolts, but in June, it reached more than 16,000 bolts, an increase of more than three times.

    Based on the above situation, the phenomenon of market stagnation has become a thing of the past. Therefore, although the stability of prices has brought temporary difficulties and pain to private industry and commerce, as Vice Premier Chen Yun said, this is "a kind of pain and difficulty that leads to new life, reconstruction, and prosperity."

    II. Adjusting Public-Private Relations

    Under the principle of "taking into account both public and private interests," the Beijing Municipal People's Government has adjusted the relationship between public and private sectors and corrected the bias of "public first, private second." For example, in terms of loans, the total amount of loans issued by the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China in March was 43,143,670,000 yuan, of which private industry and commerce accounted for only 9%. By May, it had increased to 38% of the total amount of loans, and in June, it also accounted for more than 30%. At the same time, loan interest rates have been reduced again and again to benefit production. The People's Bank reduced the interest rate from 6% to 9% to 2.4% to 3.6%, while private banks reduced it from the highest 90% in February to 18.12%, and even 5.1%. In order to invest in production and remedy the difficulties of industry and commerce, in addition to widening the scale of loans itself, the People's Bank also organized private banks to jointly grant loans.

    In terms of taxation, factories and shops with poor business were given tax reductions, exemptions, and deferred tax payments (as of the end of May, there were more than 2,500 households, totaling more than 2.85 billion yuan in tax), and tax collection methods were improved. The tax items and tax rates were adjusted in accordance with the central government's regulations. The tax collection methods for industrial and commercial taxes have been changed from simple democratic appraisal to a parallel implementation of three methods: "self-declaration, checking accounts, and calculating taxes according to rates," "self-declaration, public discussion, democratic appraisal, and combining account checking," and "fixed amount on a regular basis based on self-declaration, public discussion, and democratic appraisal." Generally, industrialists and businessmen believe that this approach has basically eliminated the phenomenon of squeezing the small by the big or squeezing the big by the small, and the phenomenon of unevenness and excessive weight, and has further achieved fairness and rationality.

    In order to solve the problems of raw materials and sales channels for factories in various major industries, state-owned enterprises have adopted processing, ordering, purchasing, and exchange methods to support production. In the past four months (from March to June), the Beijing Branch of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company processed a total of 99,327 bolts of various fabrics and 25,578 bolts of dyed cloth, accounting for more than 50% of the total output of the weaving and dyeing industry and the dyeing industry. The Grain Company processed 802,052 bags of flour. The Coal Industry Building Materials Branch purchased 101,998 tons of private coal from Mentougou. In addition, the Department Store Branch purchased a large number of department store goods such as towels, socks, cigarettes, matches, and paper; the Oil, Native Products, and Fur Branches also processed or purchased peanut oil, vermicelli, carpets, casings, and leather. At the same time, the Municipal Finance and Economics Commission assisted the Iron Industry Trade Association in establishing an Iron Industry Processing and Ordering Committee to uniformly handle processing and ordering matters. In order to specifically solve the production and sales and processing problems of private industry, the Municipal Bureau of Commerce convened a grain processing preparation meeting and a department store production and sales meeting, in which public and private industrial and commercial enterprises participated in the discussion and studied the future production and sales plans, processing proportions, and how to reduce costs, improve quality, and open up sales channels. In order to take care of the business of private shops, state-owned retail companies merged institutions and reduced the scope of business. Each professional company adjusted the difference between retail and wholesale prices to make private merchants profitable. The Department Store Company also began to negotiate prices with private merchants to specifically solve the price problems of public and private stores. In addition, it was decided that all state-owned enterprises should participate in relevant trade associations to closely link public and private relations.

    In order to solve the difficulties of various private enterprises lacking funds and those with funds having nowhere to invest, the Beijing industrial and commercial circles, with the assistance of the government, prepared to establish a public-private joint venture, the Xingye Investment Co., Ltd., to combine decentralized funds and invest in production. This will cooperate with the national economic plan and, based on the specific situation in Beijing, raise the existing production level a step further.

    III. Adjusting Labor-Capital Relations

    The most effective way to resolve labor-capital relations is to establish labor-capital consultation meetings.

    In early May, the Municipal Labor Bureau, together with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, and the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce, established labor-capital consultation committees in various industries, factories, and shops. As of now, labor-capital consultation meetings have been established in the following 14 industries and more than 60 factories and shops: iron industry, weaving and dyeing industry, oil, salt and grain industry, hardware industry, barber industry, bathhouse industry, carpet industry, mechanized flour industry, tea industry, Chinese medicine industry, new medicine industry, pottery industry, Mentougou coal small kiln industry, and Western clothing industry.

    After the establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings in various industries, factories, and shops, both labor and capital have a better understanding of the "both labor and capital benefit" policy than before. The general emphasis is on negotiating how to overcome difficulties, improve management, open up sales channels, increase capital, streamline and save, adjust treatment, and improve quality. Most workers can actively put forward opinions on strengthening labor discipline and improving management from the long-term interests of the working class. When necessary, they will voluntarily reduce wages or take turns going home to save expenses and maintain business. Due to the enthusiasm of the workers, the capitalists have also improved their confidence in management, so industry and commerce are showing a new atmosphere. For example, after consultation, Longsheng Cloth Shop, Sanyou Industrial Society, and Tongfuju Restaurant have adopted the business policy of facing the masses of the people, making small profits but selling more, and their business has turned from losing money to surplus.

    In Cihua Weaving Factory, the workers reduced their wages from seven kilograms of millet per bolt of cloth to six kilograms and four taels, and worked hard to improve the quality of their products. The grade A cloth increased from 45% to 80%. In addition to having eight employees participate in direct production, the factory also participated in capital by discounting four cotton yarns and ten bundles. The Housheng Match Factory originally produced 28 boxes of matches per day, and the agreement increased to 35 boxes. The workers also voluntarily changed the wages originally paid according to the retail price of Volt-Millet to payment by wage-Millet. In the past, the capitalists used to allocate firewood shavings and other items to the workers without price, but now the workers pay for them themselves. In this way, the factory saved 15,000 kilograms of millet in April. These are examples of labor-capital cooperation to overcome difficulties.

    Labor-capital consultation meetings can not only solve business difficulties, but also solve labor-capital disputes. For example, three-quarters of the kilns in the pottery industry had labor-capital disputes. At first, neither labor nor capital had confidence in consultation. After repeated explanations and mobilization by the Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, both parties submitted a draft and agreed to resolve the crux of the labor-capital dispute - the wage issue. At the same time, the labor-capital disputes in two kilns that had been entangled in the court for more than two months were also resolved in the consultation meeting.

    Experience has proved that doing a good job in labor-capital consultation meetings is the best way to improve labor-capital relations and an important link in developing production. At the same time, labor-capital consultation meetings are not established solely to overcome difficulties. In the consultation, we mainly focus on the specific situation, guide both labor and capital to distinguish the priorities, grasp the key to production problems, and negotiate and solve them step by step and with emphasis to promote the restoration and development of production. Therefore, this is a long-term job.

    In addition to the regular establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings, the Beijing Municipal Industrial and Commercial Adjustment Committee (composed of relevant agencies such as the Finance Committee, the Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the Labor Bureau, the Federation of Trade Unions, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce) has also made some achievements in adjusting labor-capital relations, dispelling many ideological concerns of capitalists, and improving workers' understanding of labor discipline.

    IV. The Beginning of Improvement

    Due to the above-mentioned measures of the People's Government, coupled with stable prices and the relative increase in farmers' purchasing power after the wheat harvest, private industry and commerce have shown signs of improvement. This is mainly reflected in production and sales, and the situation of opening and closing businesses.

    According to estimates by people in the industrial and commercial circles, the overall business situation in the industrial sector increased by an average of 20% to 30% in May and June compared with March and April. Among them, the rubber industry increased by 60%, the metal smelting and manufacturing industry increased by 36% in May compared with April, the weaving and dyeing industry increased by 10%, and the paper industry increased by about 80% in June compared with May. In the commercial sector, the sales volume of stores in various industries increased by an average of 10% to 15% in May and June compared with March and April. Among them, the cloth industry increased by more than 50%, the department store industry increased by 30%, and dried fruits and seafood increased by 40%.

    From the number of opening and closing businesses, it can be proved that the confidence of industrialists and businessmen has increased. The number of industrial applicants for opening businesses was 171 in April, which increased to 202 in May; the number of applicants for closing businesses was more than 200 in April, which decreased to 101 in May. The number of commercial applicants for opening businesses was 288 in May, which increased by 52 households compared with April, and increased by 41 households in June compared with May; the number of applicants for closing businesses was 482 in May, which decreased by 256 households compared with April, and 210 households in June, which decreased by 272 households compared with May. In May and June, there were 44 shops that had already applied for closing businesses and then requested to withdraw their applications, and most of them were large and medium-sized households. From the trend of opening and closing businesses, it can be seen which industries and factory shops have development prospects and which are bound to be eliminated. For example, the iron, weaving and dyeing, chemical, electrical equipment, and printing industries in the industrial sector have increased more than before. The knitting, cigarette, soap making, and alkali manufacturing industries have the largest number of closures because of the low product quality and high cost. The rice, flour, grain, grain depots, and money houses in the commercial sector have also collapsed in large numbers. This also gives industrialists and businessmen a lesson that factories and shops that have blindly developed or rely on speculation and profiteering will not have development prospects.

    In short, private industry and commerce in Beijing have begun to improve, and the Municipal People's Government will continue to implement the policy of adjusting industry and commerce. At the same time, all private industrialists and businessmen should also make the greatest efforts to improve management methods, improve technology, improve product quality, and reduce costs. In terms of public-private relations, the policy of "taking into account both public and private interests" should be implemented, and the erroneous concepts of "public first, private second" or "thin public and thick private" should be corrected. In terms of labor-capital relations, the capitalists should dispel their concerns and have open and honest consultations with the workers; the workers should pay special attention to labor discipline and promote the leading role of the working class in developing production.

　　北京工商业开始好转
　　王敬
    物价的稳定，进一步创造了恢复与发展生产的有利条件。虽然京市私营工商业因此产生了在经济改组过程中的不可避免的困难，但是在人民政府的扶助和领导之下，已开始走向正常前进的途径。
    一、物价稳定带来了“痛苦”和“新生”
    自从今年三月中央人民政府施行统一全国财经措施后，扭转了十余年来物价上涨的趋势。但是，开始时由于投机条件丧失，虚假购买力骤然消逝，以及人们重货轻币思想的转变，遂引起商人竞相抛售，形成了市场货物的普遍滞销现象，使工商业陷于暂时的困难和痛苦之中。
    京市人民政府根据中央的指示和实际情况，采取许多措施，协助私营工商业度过目前困难。首先在物价急骤下泻时，各国营贸易部门很长时期使牌价高于市价，稳定到一定水平以便于工商周转减少物价骤落的损失。以三月下旬到五月底为止的通粉、东北玉米、口小米、高粱米、五福布、丹凤火柴、恒大纸烟、三角碱面等八种主要商品的各国营公司牌价和市价比较，平均牌价高于市价百分之五·四，其中小米一项，竟高于市价百分之一六·七。同时各国营贸易公司又在市场投放货币，收购一部滞销货物。仅四、五两月即投放货币达三百余亿元。这两项工作，对稳定物价起了很大作用。到四月中旬，物价便停止下落。三个月来，日用必需品价格一直平稳。四月中旬物价总指数为一五六·九，六月中旬为一四五·八，七月中旬为一六○·二，变动极小。（物价总指数以一九四九年十二月为基期，共二十六种主要商品。）
    由于物价平稳，市场情况逐渐恢复正常。粮食交易所三月份面粉总成交量为八九、三三五袋，仅占总上市量五九○、六六七袋的百分之十五（按在一九四九年十一月物价波动时，仅一天的面粉成交量，最高即达一万袋）。到六月份情况已改变，面粉总成交量一三八、九九七袋，占总上市量四七一、二三五袋的百分之三十，上市量较三月减少百分之二十，而成交量则增加了百分之五十五。同样，棉布的成交量也是逐月增加，纱布交易所三月份的总成交量为二一、七四七匹，五月份增到五六、七三四匹，增加了百分之一百六十。由此可以看出：物价平稳后的三个多月内，囤积的货物已大部出售，供求关系逐渐走向正常。同时，由于全国各地物价的稳定，城乡物资交流也有显著好转。据北京车站统计：私人粮食输入量四月比三月增加百分之五十五，五月又比四月增加百分之六十五，六月比五月因雨及农忙关系减少百分之二十六。销售到察绥、冀中、冀东等地的棉布数量更是激增，三月份仅四千余匹，到六月份已达一万六千余匹，增加三倍以上。
    根据以上情况看来，市场呆滞的现象，已成过去，因此，物价的稳定，虽然也曾给私营工商业带来了暂时的困难和痛苦，但正如陈云副总理所说，这是“走向新生，走向重建，走向繁荣的一种痛苦和困难。”
    二、调整公私关系
    在“公私兼顾”的原则下，京市人民政府调整了公私关系，纠正了“先公后私”的偏向。例如在贷款方面，三月份中国人民银行北京分行放款总额为四、三一四、三六七万元，其中私营工商业仅占百分之九，到五月份已增加为占放款总额的百分之三十八，六月份也占百分之三十以上。同时，放款利率一再降低，以利生产。人民银行由六分至九分降到二·四至三·六分，私营行庄则由二月份的最高九十分降到一八·一二、以至五·一分。为投资生产补救工商业的困难，人民银行除本身放宽贷款尺度外，并组织私营行庄联合放款。
    在税收方面，对营业不好的工厂商店酌予减税、免税、缓税（截至五月底止共有二千五百多户，合税款二十八亿五千多万元），并改善征税方法，和遵照中央规定调整了税目、税率。工商业税的征收方法，由单纯的民主评议，改为“自报查账依率计征”，“自报公议民主评定并结合查账”，和“在自报公议民主评定基础上定期定额”三种办法并行。一般工商业者认为这样作基本上已消灭了以小挤大，或以大挤小，畸轻畸重的现象，更进一步地达到了公平合理。
    为了解决各主要行业工厂的原料和销路问题，国营企业采取加工、订货、收购、交换等方式来扶植生产。总计四个月来（三月至六月）花纱布北京分公司加工各种布匹共九九、三二七匹，染布共二五、五七八匹，占织染业及染业全部产量的百分之五十以上。粮食公司加工面粉八○二、○五二袋。煤业建筑器材分公司收购门头沟私营煤一○一、九九八吨。此外，百货分公司收购了大批毛巾、袜子、纸烟、火柴、纸张等百货品；油脂、土产、皮毛等三分公司也加工或收购了花生油、粉丝、地毯、肠衣、皮张等。同时，市财经委员会更协助铁工业同业公会成立铁工业加工订货委员会，以统一办理加工订货事宜。为具体解决私营工业的产销和加工问题，市商业局召开了粮食加工准备会议，和百货产销会议，公私营工商业共同参加讨论，研究出了今后产销计划，加工比重，及如何减低成本、提高质量，打开销路等问题。为了照顾私营商店的营业，公营零售公司合并机构、缩小了经营范围。各专业公司调整了零售价和批发价的差额，使私商有利可图。百货公司并开始进行和私商议价，以具体解决公私商店的价格问题。此外，又决定各公营企业一律参加各有关同业公会，密切公私关系。
    为解决各私营企业缺乏资金，及有资金者无处投放的困难，京市工商界在政府协助下，筹组了公私合营的兴业投资股份有限公司，结合分散资金，投向生产，将配合国家经济计划，根据京市具体情况，把现有生产水平，提高一步。
    三、调整劳资关系
    解决劳资关系的最有效办法，是成立劳资协商会议。
    五月初，市劳动局便会同市总工会、工商两局、及工商联合筹备委员会等单位，在各行业，工厂、商店建立劳资协商委员会。截至现在止，已成立了劳资协商会议的有：铁工业、织染业、油盐粮业、五金业、理发业、浴堂业、地毯业、机制面粉业、茶叶业、国药业、新药业、盆窑业、门煤小窑业、西服业等十四个行业，和六十余家工厂商店。
    各行业、工厂、商店建立劳资协商会议后，劳资双方对“劳资两利”政策的认识，都较前提高一步。一般的着重协商如何度过难关、改善经营、打开销路、增加资本、精简节约、调整待遇、以及提高质量等。大多数工人，都能从工人阶级长远利益出发，积极提出加强劳动纪律及改善经营的意见，必要时更自动降低工资，或轮流回家，以节省开支，维持营业。由于工人的热情，资方也提高了经营信心，于是工商业呈现一种新的气象。例如隆盛布店、三友实业社、同福居饭庄等，经过协商以后，都采取了面向人民大众、薄利多销的营业方针，营业已由赔累转向赢余。
    慈华织布厂，工人降低工资由每匹布七斤小米降到六斤四两，并努力提高产品质量，甲级布由百分之四十五提高到百分之八十，厂方除使八个职员参加直接生产外，并参加资本折棉纱四件零十捆。厚生火柴厂原来日产二十八箱火柴，协议增至三十五箱，工人并自愿将原来按照伏地小米零售价支付的工资改为按工资米支付，过去资方无价配给工人的劈柴刨花等物，改由工人出钱购买。这样，该厂四月份即节省了一万五千斤小米。这都是劳资协力度过困难的实例。
    劳资协商会议不仅能解决营业困难，而且能解决劳资纠纷。例如盆窑业全业四分之三的窑有劳资纠纷，最初劳资双方对协商都没有信心，经劳动局、市总工会等多次解释动员，双方才将草案提出，协议解决劳资争议的症结——工资问题。同时有两个窑的劳资纠纷已在法院纠缠了两个多月，也在协商会议中一并解决了。
    经验证明：搞好劳资协商会议是改善劳资关系的最好办法，是发展生产的重要环节。同时劳资协商会议并不是单纯为了度过困难而建立的，在协商中主要是针对具体情况，引导劳资双方，分别轻重缓急，抓住有关生产问题的关键，有步骤、有重点的协商解决，以推动生产的恢复和发展。因此，这是一个长期性的工作。
    除了经常的建立劳资协商会议外，京市工商业调整委员会（由财委会、工商两局、劳动局、总工会、工商联合会等各有关机关组成）在调整劳资关系上，也做出了一些成绩，解除了资本家许多思想顾虑，提高了工人对劳动纪律的认识。
    四、好转的开始
    由于以上人民政府的种种措施，再加物价稳定，麦收后农民购买力的相对提高，所以私营工商业已呈好转。主要表现在产销、和开歇业的情况上。
    据工商界人士估计：工业方面总的营业情况，五、六月份产销量较三、四月份平均增加了百分之二十至三十，其中橡胶业增加百分之六十，金属冶制业五月份产销量较四月份增加百分之三六，织染业增百分之十，造纸业六月份比五月份增加百分之八十左右。在商业方面：各行业商店的销货量，五、六月份比三、四月份平均增加百分之十至百分之十五，其中布业增加百分之五十以上，百货业增百分之三十，干果海味增百分之四十。
    从开歇业户数里，可以证明工商业者经营信心的提高。工业申请开业者四月份为一七一户，五月份增为二○二户；申请歇业者四月份为二百多户，五月份减为一○一户。商业申请开业者五月份为二八八户，较四月份增五十二户，六月份又比五月份增四一户；申请歇业者五月份四八二户，较四月份减少二五六户，六月份二一○户，又较五月份减少二七二户，而五、六两月中，更有已申请歇业又呈请撤销的商店四十四户，且多为大中户。从开歇业的动向里，可以看出什么行业和工厂商店是有发展前途的，那些是势必被淘汰的。例如工业中的铁工、织染、化工、电气器材、印刷等业都已较前增加，针织、卷烟、造胰制碱等业，因为产品质量低成本高，则是歇业户中最多的。商业中的米面粮、粮栈、银钱号等行业，更是大批倒闭。这也给工商业者一个教训，盲目发展起来的，或依靠投机倒把为生的工厂、商店，是不会有发展前途的了。
    总之，京市私营工商业已开始好转，市人民政府将继续贯彻调整工商业的政策。同时各私营工商业者也应尽最大努力来改善经营方法，改进技术，提高产品质量，减低成本。在公私关系方面，应贯彻“公私兼顾”政策，纠正“先公后私”或“薄公厚私”的错误观念。在劳资关系上，资方应去掉顾虑，和工人开诚协商；工人对劳动纪律方面应特别注意，发扬工人阶级在发展生产中的领导作用。（京市新闻处稿）
