Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th. The Chinese Communist Party organizations at all levels in the Southwest Administrative Region, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee's Southwest Bureau, have successively launched rectification campaigns. The CPC Central Committee's Southwest Bureau, the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, the first-level organs of the Southwest Administrative Region, the Southwest Military Region and its affiliated units began rectification in early June; the CPC organizations at all levels in the four administrative regions of Eastern Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan, as well as Chongqing City, began rectification in late June and July; the CPC organizations at all levels in the three provinces of Guizhou, Xikang, and Yunnan have also successively launched rectification campaigns.

The focus of the rectification work in the Southwest Region is to summarize the work of the past six months since entering the Southwest, examine the errors, shortcomings, and undesirable work styles such as bureaucracy, commandism, and sectarianism that have occurred in completing various work tasks, as well as the hedonistic and corrupt thinking that is growing in some cadres.

At the beginning of the rectification movement, all localities carried out sufficient mobilization and deliberation to correct and dispel certain cadres' incorrect attitudes and ideological concerns about the rectification. For example, some cadres initially believed that there was no wind to rectify, and therefore expressed indifference to the rectification movement. Some believed that they had already undergone two rectifications in the past, and it was still the same old routine. People with this view took a dismissive attitude towards this rectification. Some believed that rectification was for higher levels and had nothing to do with them, so they didn't care much. Some cadres who had made mistakes in their work held a mentality of just getting through it, some avoided rectification under the pretext of being busy with work, and some were unwilling to expose shortcomings in front of the masses. The Party committees of various provinces and cities and the Party organizations of various organs generally combined the ideological situation of cadres in their respective regions and organs, carried out rectification mobilization, clearly explained the purpose of rectification, initially clarified various incorrect ideas, and established a correct attitude towards rectification.

Currently, various parts of the Southwest are adopting the following two methods to carry out rectification.

(1) Rectification while working. This method is mostly used in the leading organs of the first-level organs of the Southwest Region and the provincial and district Party committees, that is, half a day is used for daily work and the other half for rectification study. The general steps are: reading documents, inspecting work, making work summaries, and then examining personal thoughts and making appraisals. In order to carry out learning in a planned and led manner, all organs have organized rectification study committees and published wall newspapers to guide learning and exchange experiences. At present, the work inspections of various organs have mostly come to an end and have begun to transition to the stage of examining personal ideology and work style.

(2) Convening rectification meetings. This is the most common method adopted in various places. That is, concentrating the main local work cadres and holding rectification meetings for ten days to half a month. Because cadres are currently scattered and the tasks in the new districts are busy, it is not possible to take a lot of time to study. Therefore, this method of centralized meetings for rectification is adopted by general areas. The general steps of the meeting are: reading documents, having the person in charge make a work report, the groups conducting discussions and inspections, and then making a work summary and arranging future work. In the discussions and inspections, the work attitude and work style of each individual are examined in connection with the work. Cadres who have participated in the rectification meeting return to become the backbone of the rectification movement in various places, and then lead general cadres to carry out rectification in the same way. The Party committees of the Eastern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Southern Sichuan districts have all convened such meetings, while the Northern Sichuan District Party Committee and the provincial committees of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces are conducting rectification in the form of Party representative meetings.

In addition, in Party schools and training courses, learning and rectification are combined. The Party school run by the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee has already started, first coordinating with rectification to inspect work, and then shifting to studying rent reduction policies.

This rectification is being carried out in close combination with various work tasks. The first-level organs in the Southwest Region have all carried out inspections according to the characteristics of their work. The Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee's Southwest Bureau inspected the phenomena of not being open enough in implementing cadre policies and of not being able to understand the ideological situation of cadres in a timely manner; the Logistics Command of the Southwest Military Region launched an inspection of various violations of laws and discipline. At the rectification meetings in various places, the persons in charge of the Party committees made reports on the work of the entire region. These reports not only pointed out the shortcomings in the work, but also affirmed the achievements made in the work. At the rectification meeting in Western Sichuan, the heads of various departments made special speeches on military affairs, Party affairs, united front, taxation, and adjustment of industry and commerce. The rectification meeting in Southern Sichuan in July and August combined rent reduction and anti-hegemony preparatory work for rectification. The Northern Sichuan District Party Committee also organized inspection teams to go to certain units to inspect the implementation of policies and leadership style.

### 西南区展开整风运动  重点是总结检查进入西南以来的工作  采取与工作结合及召开整风会议方式

　　西南区展开整风运动
    重点是总结检查进入西南以来的工作
    采取与工作结合及召开整风会议方式
    【新华社重庆九日电】西南大行政区中国共产党的各级组织在中共中央西南局领导下，已先后展开整风运动。中共中央西南局、西南军政委员会、西南大行政区一级机关、西南军区及所属各单位，早于六月初即开始整风；川东、川南、川西、川北四行政区及重庆市各级中共组织则于六月下旬和七月间开始整风；贵州、西康、云南三省的各级中共组织，亦均先后展开整风运动。
    西南区整风工作的重点是：总结进入西南半年来的工作，检查在完成各项工作任务中所发生的错误、缺点以及官僚主义、命令主义和关门主义等不良作风，以及在某些干部中滋长着的享乐腐化的思想。
    整风运动开始时，各地均进行了充分的动员和酝酿，纠正和解除了某些干部对整风的不正确的态度和思想顾虑。例如，某些干部在整风开始时，曾认为无风可整，因而对整风运动表示冷淡。有的认为过去已经整过两次了，还不就是那一套。有这种看法的人，就对这次整风抱着轻视的态度。有的认为整风是整上级，与自己无关，不大在乎。曾在工作中犯了错误的某些干部，则抱着过关思想，有的借口工作繁忙，躲避整风；有的不愿在群众前面暴露缺点。各省、市党委会及各机关党的组织都普遍地结合本地区、本机关干部的思想情况，进行了整风动员，明确地说明了整风目的，初步地澄清了各种不正确的思想，树立了对整风的正确态度。
    目前西南各地正在采取下面两种方式进行整风。
    （一）一面工作，一面整风。在西南区一级机关和各省委、区党委的领导机关，多采用这种办法，即以半天的时间进行日常工作，另以半天的时间进行整风学习。一般步骤是：阅读文件、检查工作、作出工作总结，然后再检查个人思想，作出鉴定。为了有计划、有领导地进行学习，各机关都组织了整风学习委员会，并出版墙报，领导学习和交流经验。目前各机关的工作检查大都已告结束，开始转入了检查个人思想作风的阶段。
    （二）召开整风会议。这是各地采用最多的一种方式。这即是集中主要地方工作干部，利用十天至半月的时间，举行整风会议。由于目前干部分散，新区工作任务繁忙，不能抽出很多时间来学习，因而，这种集中开会整风的方式就为一般地区所采用。会议一般的步骤是：阅读文件，由负责人作工作报告，各小组进行讨论和检查，然后作出工作总结并布置今后工作。在讨论和检查中，并且联系工作来检查各个人的工作态度和工作作风。参加了整风会议的干部，回去即成为各地整风运动的骨干，再用同样方法，领导一般干部进行整风。川东、川西、川南各区党委都已召开了这样的会议，川北区党委和云南、贵州两省省委会则以党代表会议的形式进行整风。
    此外，在党校和轮训班中，则是一方面学习，一方面整风，两者结合进行。贵州省委举办的党校已经开学，首先配合整风，检查工作；然后转入学习减租政策。
    这次整风是在与各项工作任务密切结合的情况下进行的。西南区一级各机关，都按照自己工作的特点，进行了检查。中共中央西南局组织部检查了在执行干部政策中的不够放手以及对于干部的思想情况不够和不能及时了解等现象；西南军区后勤司令部则开展了检查各种违法乱纪的现象。在各地的整风会议上，党委负责人都作了全区工作的报告。这些报告不仅指出了工作中的缺点，同时也肯定了工作中所取得的成绩。川西区的整风会议上，各部门的负责人曾作了军事、党务、统一战线、税收、调整工商业等专题发言。川南区的整风会议在七、八两个月中结合减租和反霸的准备工作来整风。川北区党委并且组织了检查小组，赴某些单位检查执行政策的情况和领导作风。
