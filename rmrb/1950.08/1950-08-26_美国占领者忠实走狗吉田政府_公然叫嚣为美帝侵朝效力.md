Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st - The Yoshida government of Japan, a loyal lackey of the American occupiers, issued a white paper on foreign policy on the 19th entitled "The Korean War and Japan's Position," exposing the ambition of Japanese aggressive forces to take the opportunity to rise again and carry out renewed aggression. In the white paper, the Yoshida government not only obsequiously agreed with the United States' war of aggression against Korea, but also openly clamored to help the United States invade Korea. After praising the criminal activities of the United States and other countries in "resolving the Korean War," the "White Paper" stated: "Cooperating with various democratic countries (referring to imperialist countries) and helping to strengthen their unity should be regarded as a measure of our self-defense." The "White Paper" revealed the reactionary Japanese government's conspiracy to sign a separate peace treaty with the US imperialist bloc, and shamelessly slandered the Japanese people who "seriously consider a comprehensive peace treaty" as being "used" by the "conspiracy" of the Japanese Communist Party. At the same time, the white paper openly defended the US government's transformation of Japan into a base of aggression, claiming that Japan is the so-called "most important outpost of the United Nations forces," and hinted that it would take even more barbaric measures to suppress the Japanese people who oppose turning Japan into a US aggression base.

　　美国占领者忠实走狗吉田政府
    公然叫嚣为美帝侵朝效力
    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：美国占领者的忠实走狗日本吉田政府，于十九日发表题为“朝鲜战争及日本立场”的外交白皮书，暴露了日本侵略势力企图乘机再起和重行侵略的野心。吉田政府在白皮书中不仅奴颜婢膝地赞同美国对朝鲜的侵略战争，并公然叫嚣帮助美国侵略朝鲜。“白皮书”在赞扬美国等“解决朝鲜战乱”的罪恶活动后说：“与各民主国家（按指帝国主义国家）合作以及协助加强其团结，则应认为正是我们自卫的一种措施。”“白皮书”透露了日本反动政府阴谋与美帝国主义集团签订单独和约，它无耻地污蔑“认真考虑全面和约”的日本人民是被日本共产党的“阴谋”所“利用”。白皮书同时公然为美国政府把日本变为侵略基地作辩护，声称日本是所谓“联合国部队的一个最重要的前哨”，并暗示将以更野蛮的措施来镇压那些反对把日本变成美国侵略基地的日本人民。
