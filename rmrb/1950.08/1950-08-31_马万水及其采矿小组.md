　　Ma Wanshui and His Mining Team
　　Chang Hai
　　No one at Pangjiabao Mining Area of Longyan Iron Mine doesn't know about the Mining Fifth Team led by Ma Wanshui. It is an outstanding model production team, and it once created the highest record for rock tunnel excavation in the entire mine.

　　In order to speed up the glorious task of building the People's Iron Mine, Pangjiabao Mine launched a red flag competition in February this year. The Mining Fifth Team joined this competition.

　　The Mining Fifth Team has a total of fourteen workers, but except for Ma Wanshui, who is an old worker, the others are all novices who have just come from the countryside and don't know anything about the mine. Therefore, Ma Wanshui used all the skills he had learned over the past ten years to patiently teach the new workers techniques, wholeheartedly wanting to win the red flag. He taught everyone how to hold a drill, how to swing a hammer, etc., taking turns day and night. When someone didn't understand, he would work with them, first demonstrating and then asking them to do it. Once, a worker accidentally hit his hand with a hammer, but he didn't make a sound. Later, he told people: "The pain will pass in a while. If you say something, he will panic and learn even less." In this way, in less than ten days, the workers learned how to swing a hammer and hold a drill. Then, Ma Wanshui taught everyone techniques such as loading explosives and igniting fuses. Thanks to his efforts, seven or eight workers, in addition to being able to use side hammers, top hammers, and flat hammers, could also work at will, using both their left and right hands, and could work in any kind of tunnel. In a tunnel that was two and a half meters wide and one meter eight high, they could work together with three drills and six people, and no one would get in anyone else's way when they grabbed the hammer. People like Zhou Wanshan, Zhang Baorong, and Fu Wanlu could even swing more than three hundred hammers in a row—this is Ma Wanshui's special continuous hammering method, which is not particularly tiring and gets a lot of work done. Ma himself can swing four hundred and fifty times in one go. Because Ma followed the rules when he started teaching, the new workers' working positions, front and rear distances, and postures for holding drills and swinging hammers all had certain standards. When swinging hammers, they moved like a machine, not only working persistently and efficiently, but also ensuring that the entire team did not have a single accident in six months. In four months, the team trained new workers and increased the mine's labor force in this way.

　　Because all the new workers mastered the techniques, the team's work went ahead of other teams. First, in March, they exceeded the excavation task by 122 percent and won the first red flag. Everyone was very happy. But Ma Wanshui called on everyone: "Now that we have won the red flag, we must protect it!"

　　With the help and guidance of higher authorities, Ma Wanshui paid more attention to further improving the workers' skills. He often discussed and improved techniques with everyone: how to judge the direction of the explosives, how to drill holes according to the changes in the rock layers, etc. And with the improvement of the explosive power of gunpowder, deep-hole operations were implemented, increasing the depth of each hole from one foot two or three inches to one foot eight or nine inches. In this way, fewer holes were drilled, gunpowder was saved, and more coal was blasted down—increasing from two cars in the past to three cars.

　　With this full working enthusiasm and constant research and improvement of techniques, they have exceeded the production tasks every month since March. Each time they were evaluated, they received the red flag. In June, in order to welcome "July 1st," they created the highest record for rock tunnel excavation in the entire mine, exceeding the task by 53 percent, as a gift to the Party's birthday. At the same time, they also made great achievements in saving raw materials. According to statistics, the raw materials they saved in half a year totaled 155 million yuan in RMB.

　　In this way, the team became the banner of the production competition. But the workers in the team were not proud and complacent about this, but instead more consciously abided by labor discipline, preparing the tools in advance, and starting work immediately when they heard the whistle, never being late or leaving early. And they motivated and transformed the so-called "backward" workers Cheng Fuzeng, Yin Zhizhong, etc., from other teams. Under their leadership and influence, in the second quarter, model production teams such as the Mining Fourth Team, the Nineteenth Team, and the Electrical Team emerged, pushing the entire mine's work forward.

　　The Fifth Team became a red flag team and was praised by the people and received spiritual and material rewards from the Mining Area, the Longyan Coal Mine General Plant, the Longyan Industrial Union, and the Xuanhua City Federation of Trade Unions. The team workers Li Yu and Xiao Youzhi were honorably promoted to production team leaders; Tian Fuyu, Zhou Wanshan, and Yu Tiyun were also promoted to deputy team leaders; Ma Wanshui was elected by everyone as a member of the Mining Affairs Management Committee. In the "May Day" merit evaluation and commendation, the entire team received a collective award, Ma Wanshui was rated as a first-class meritorious worker, and Li Yu, Wang Yichang, and Fu Wanlu were rated as second-class meritorious workers. Everyone felt boundless glory, and the general plant awarded them a prize flag with the words: "Pioneers of excavation, models of production!"

　　马万水及其采矿小组
    长海
    提起马万水领导的采矿第五组，龙烟铁矿庞家堡采矿所是没有人不知道的。它是一个出色的模范生产小组，他曾创造了全矿岩石巷道掘进的最高纪录。
    为了加紧完成修建人民铁矿的光荣任务，今年二月，庞家堡矿展开了红旗竞赛。采矿五组卷入了这一竞赛运动。
    采矿五组共有十四个工友，但除去马万水是个老工人外，别人都是刚从农村来的生手，对矿山这一套，一点不摸门。于是马万水便把他十几年来所学的本领施展出来，耐心教新工友学技术，一心一意要想夺得红旗。他在白天黑夜轮流着把怎样掌钎、怎样打锤等教给大家，谁还不会时，他就和他一起工作，先给他示范，然后再叫他去照着干。有一次，工友因不慎把锤子打在他手上，他一点也不吱声。后来他对人说：“疼一会就过去了，你一说他就心慌，更学不好。”这样，没十天工夫，工友们都学会打锤、掌钎了。接着马万水又教大家装药、点炮等技术。经过他的努力培植，有七八个工友，除了能打边锤、顶锤、卧锤外，还能随心所欲，左右开弓，在什么样的坑道都能作活。在二米五宽、一米八高的一个洞子里，他们可以三盘钎六个人一齐工作，抢起锤来谁也碍不着谁。像周万山、张宝荣、傅万禄等，更能一连气打三百多锤—这是马万水所特具的连续打锤法，既不特别累，干的活又多。马自己可以这样一气打四百五十下。由于马开始教时都能按着规矩做，因此新工友的工作位置、前后左右距离、掌钎打锤姿势等，都有一定标准，打起锤来就像一架机器似的在动作，不但干活持久，效率高，而且全组在半年中没发生过一次事故。四个月工夫，该组就这样在工作中培养训练了新工友，增加了生产的生力军。
    由于新工友人人都掌握了技术，该组的工作便走到了别组的前头。首先，三月份他们以超额完成掘进任务百分之一百二十二，夺得了头一面红旗。大家心里十分高兴。可是马万水号召大家：“咱们得了红旗，就要保护着它！”
    在上级的帮助指导下，马万水对工友技术的进一步提高更加注意了，他经常和大家共同研究改进技术：如何看炮向，如何随石层的变化进行打眼等。并随着火药爆炸力的提高，实行了深孔作业，将每眼深度由一尺二、三，加深到一尺八、九。这样，眼打少了、火药节省了，崩下的煤也多了——由过去的两车增到三车。
    在这种饱满的工作情绪和经常不断的研究改进技术的情况下，从三月份以来，他们每月都超额完成了生产任务。每次评奖，都得到红旗。六月份他们为迎接“七一”，更以超过任务百分之五十三，创造了全矿岩石巷道掘进的最高纪录，来作为对党生日的献礼。与此同时，在节约原料上，他们也作出了很大成绩。据统计：他们半年节省的原料，共合人民币达一亿五千五百万元之多。
    这样，该组成了生产竞赛的旗帜。但组里的工友们并不以此而骄傲自满，却都更加自觉的遵守劳动纪律，事先把工具准备好，一听到上班的笛声马上出发工作，从未迟到早退过。并带动改造了别组不要的所谓“落后”工人程福增、尹志忠等。在他们这样的带头影响下，在第二季工作中，便又涌现出了采矿四组、十九组、电气组等模范生产小组，使全矿工作，向前推进了一步。
    第五组成了红旗组，受到了人们的称赞，得到了采矿所、龙烟煤矿总厂、龙烟产业工会、宣化市总工会等的精神、物质奖励。该组工人李玉、肖有芝，光荣地升为生产小组长；田福玉、周万山、于梯云三人，也被提升为副组长；马万水则被大家选为矿务管理会委员。“五一”评功奖模中，全组受到了集体奖励，马万水被评为一等功臣，李玉、王义昌、傅万禄被评为二等功臣。大家都感觉到无上的荣耀，总厂奖给他们的奖旗上写着：“掘进的先锋，生产的模范！”
