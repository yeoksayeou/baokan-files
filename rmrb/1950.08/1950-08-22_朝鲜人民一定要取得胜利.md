　　The Korean People Are Bound to Achieve Victory
　　Ivanov

　　These days, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resembles a military camp. Workers in various manufacturing plants and factories, mines and pits, are competing to work uninterruptedly to support the army engaged in a just war of liberation. The Korean people are working with great enthusiasm, and the competition is being carried out under the slogan "Everything for the front! Everything for victory!"

　　Trade unions are the organizers that mobilize the masses to strive for over-plan production and effectively support the front lines. They quickly respond to the patriotic initiatives of advanced workers, mobilizing the masses to emulate their example of selfless labor.

　　Here are a few things happening in the Republic these days: Kim Ko-man, a miner at the Sŏngdong Coal Mine, had already completed his two-year plan ahead of schedule by July 10th. He said at a miners' meeting:

　　"Until now, I have been doing the work of two people, completing two production quotas every day. Now that the war for the complete liberation of our country is being waged, and when the motherland needs more coal, I understand that I should work even better. Comrades! I swear to you that I will work even better and do the work of three people."

　　Kim Ko-man faithfully kept his word. Every day, he completes more than three people's quotas.

　　Ko Pil-sin, a famous steelmaking technician in Korea, adopted the method of Chesnokov, a steelmaking technician at the Moscow "Hammer and Sickle" factory. He reduced the steelmaking time by two hours and produced many products beyond the plan.

　　Volunteers who more effectively support the People's Army generate new initiatives among the masses every day. Workers in many factories have proposed working two to four hours in their spare time and reducing holidays.

　　Korean women are showing extraordinary initiative, replacing their husbands and brothers who have gone to the front lines to work everywhere. At the T'anban Mine in Kanggye County, 600 women have joined the production, and they are very successfully completing the work that men did in peacetime. Hundreds of housewives work in factories for several hours every day. They donate all their income to the defense fund.

　　There are many labor heroines among Korean women. They are well-known throughout the country. For example, Kim Yong-sil and Li Bong-hui, female workers at the Pyongyang Textile Factory. In three months, they completed their two-year plan. These days, each of them is producing the quota of products stipulated for two skilled female workers.

　　A national fundraising campaign for the defense fund is underway. Working people send thousands of packages and letters to the front lines. They congratulate the commanders and fighters of the People's Army on their combat achievements and hope that they will quickly achieve complete victory over the enemy.

　　Not only workers, peasants, and the laboring intellectuals participate in establishing the defense fund, but also the owners of shops and private enterprises participate in this work. The merchant Li Tai-young donated about two million yuan to the defense fund. Merchants in Sokam raised 6,519,000 yuan in one day.

　　The rural laborers also support the front lines by emulating the example of the working class. The peasants send large quantities of meat, rice, and vegetables to the front lines.

　　The People's Army's successful advance southward encourages the working people to create new merits. The country is filled with a great political and labor upsurge. We see how enthusiastically the working people welcome the news that some outstanding soldiers in combat have been awarded the title of Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The names of the fearless air force personnel Kim Ki-ok, Li Mun-sun, Kim Hui-kyong; and the naval personnel Kim Kun-ok and Li Wan-kun are household names. We remember the meeting held not long ago in a Pyongyang factory when people heard about the achievements of these heroes. People were filled with unparalleled joy. An elderly female worker gave a loud speech saying:

　　"They are fighting the Americans well, very well! Let the robbers from across the Atlantic remember: We are the masters of Korea, not the Americans! Kill these murderers!"

　　The South Korean people happily and ecstatically welcome their liberators—the soldiers of the People's Army. In the areas liberated from the iron hooves of the U.S. and Syngman Rhee's puppet army, people's committees have been immediately established and land reform has been implemented. Telegrams of congratulation from the working people of the newly liberated areas are constantly being sent to the government of the Republic, the People's Army, and Kim Il-sung. At a meeting in Naryonbaek, the farmer Lin Xue-shi said:

　　"Truth has finally prevailed! We farmers have also become the masters of the land. We will live freely and happily like our brothers in the North. I wholeheartedly thank the People's Government, the soldiers of the People's Army, and the people's leader Kim Il-sung—they have brought us the happiness of a new life."

　　The U.S. and Syngman Rhee's troops, retreating under the blows of the People's Army, are destroying cities, factories, bridges, and postal and telecommunications facilities. Under the leadership of the people's committees, the South Korean people are doing their best to quickly restore everything that has been destroyed. A few days after the liberation of Seoul, transportation lines were repaired, and the water supply was restored. The city immediately received electricity from North Korea.

　　The Korean people are facing historically significant days. They are filled with a spirit of united struggle, and their will to fight and win is indestructible. Patriots are demanding to go to the front lines, to the foremost positions. Every day, men and women submit applications to volunteer for the People's Army.

　　The American aggressors, suffering a series of defeats, are trying to retaliate against peaceful residents with their vicious atrocities: American planes are frantically bombing cities and villages and strafing pedestrians with machine guns. We visited Nampo City after being bombed by American planes. We saw hundreds of destroyed houses and countless murdered women, old people, and children. The same situation exists in Wonsan. As a result of the bombing, countless homes, schools, and hospitals were destroyed, and thousands of peaceful residents were killed.

　　The beastly acts of the U.S. and Rhee bandits evoke not fear but anger in the hearts of the Korean people, and unparalleled hatred for armed intervention. The entire people have formed a fighting, fraternal family. They have a great and lofty goal: to drive the American interventionists out of their land and achieve complete victory.

　　The Korean people will surely achieve this goal! Such is the will of the people! …

　　朝鲜人民一定要取得胜利
    伊凡诺夫
    这些天以来朝鲜民主主义人民共和国好像是一个军营。各制造场和工厂；矿山和矿井的工人们为了不间断地支援进行正义解放战争的军队而竞赛地工作着。朝鲜人民以巨大的热情劳动着，竞赛是在“一切为了前线！一切为了胜利！”的口号下进行的。
    职工会乃是发动群众为争取超计划生产，为争取有效地支援前线而斗争的组织者。它们迅速地响应着先进工人的爱国倡议，动员群众仿效他们的榜样进行忘我的劳动。
    这就是这些天以来共和国生活中的几件事情：寺洞煤矿矿工金科满到七月十日已提前完成了自己的两年计划。他在矿工会议上说：
    “到现在为止，我都是干两个人的活，每天完成两个生产定额。现在当进行争取我国全部解放的战争，当祖国需要更多煤的时候，我了解了应该要更好地工作。同志们！我向你们宣誓要更好地工作，要干三个人的活。”
    金科满忠实地信守着自己的话。每天他完成三个人的定额还要多。
    朝鲜著名的炼钢技工高弼信（译音）采用了的莫斯科“镰锤”工厂炼钢技工切斯诺科夫的方法。他将炼钢时间缩减了两小时，超计划生产出很多产品。
    更有效地支援人民军的志愿每天都在群众中产生着新的倡议。许多工厂的工人提议在业余工作两小时——四小时，并减少休假日。
    朝鲜的妇女表现着异常的积极性，她们到处代替开往前线的丈夫与兄弟进行工作。在江界郡的坦班（译音）矿坑有六百名妇女来参加了生产，她们很有成绩地完成着男人们在和平时期所做的工作，数百名家庭主妇每天在制造厂中劳动几小时。她们将全部收入都捐作为国防基金之用。
    在朝鲜妇女当中有不少的劳动英雄。她们是全国知名的。例如，平壤纺织工厂女工金永实和李凤姬。在三个月中她们就完成了自己的两年计划。在这些天以来，她们每个人都生产着为两个熟练女工所规定的定额的产品。
    在全国进行着国防基金的募捐。劳动人民将成千的包裹和信件寄往前线，他们祝贺人民军的指战员的战斗成绩，希望他们迅速地完全取得对敌人的胜利。
    不只是工人、农民和劳动知识分子参加建立国防基金，就是连商店和私有企业的所有者也参加了这个工作。商人李泰永捐献了约二百万元充作国防基金。石岩（译音）的商人们在一日之内就募集了六百五十一万九千元。
    乡村的劳动者们也仿效着工人阶级的榜样支援前线。农民们将大批的肉、米和蔬菜送往前线。
    人民军的顺利向南进军鼓舞着劳动人民创立新的功绩。国内充满着巨大的政治和劳动高潮。我们看到了劳动人民是多么热烈地来欢迎某些战斗中的优秀军人获得朝鲜民主主义人民共和国英雄称号的消息。大无畏的空军人员金基玉、李文顺、金熙敬（译音）；海军人员金君钰和李完根的名字都是家晓户喻的。我们记得不久前平壤的一个工厂在听到关于这些英雄们的功绩时所召开的会议。人们充满了无比的快乐。一个老年女工大声地演说称：
    “他们打美国人打得好，很好！让大西洋彼岸的强盗们记着：朝鲜的主人是我们，不是美国人！打死他们这些凶手！”
    南朝鲜人民快乐和狂喜地欢迎自己的解放者——人民军的军人们。在从美国和李承晚伪军铁蹄下解放出来的地区内，立即建立了人民委员会，实行了土地改革。新解放地区劳动人民的贺电不断地寄给共和国政府、人民军和金日成。在南延白的会议上农民林学石说：
    “真理到底是胜利了！我们这些庄稼主也做了土地的主人。我们将要像我们北方的兄弟们一样自由和快乐地过日子了。我全心全意地感谢人民政府、人民军的兵士、人民领袖金日成——他们给咱们带来了新生活的幸福。”
    在人民军打击下退却的美国和李承晚军队破坏着城市、工厂、桥梁、邮电工具。南朝鲜人民在人民委员会的领导下用尽一切努力迅速恢复被破坏了的一切。汉城解放后经过了不几日，已修整了交通线，恢复了水道供给。城市立即从北朝鲜得到了电力。
    朝鲜人民正面临着具有历史意义的日子。他们充满着一致奋发的精神，他们进行斗争和胜利的意志是不可被摧毁的。爱国者们都要求上前线，到最前方的阵地去。每天都有男人和女人呈递志愿参加人民军的申请书。
    遭受一连串失败的美国侵略者们力图以自己的恶毒暴行报复和平居民：美国飞机疯狂地轰炸城市与乡村，用机枪扫射行人。我们曾访问了经美机轰炸后的南浦城。我们看见了数百间被毁的房屋，无数被杀害的妇女、老人和儿童。在元山也是这样一种情景。由于轰炸的结果，无数的住宅、学校、医院被毁掉了，千余和平居民被杀死。
    美、李匪徒的兽行在朝鲜人民心中引起的不是恐惧，而是忿怒，是对于武装干涉的无比的憎恨。全体人民结成了一个战斗的、友爱的家庭。他们有一个伟大和崇高的目的：从自己的土地上驱逐美国干涉者，取得完全胜利。
    朝鲜人民定将达到自己的这个目的！人民的意志就是如此！……
