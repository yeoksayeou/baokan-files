　　After Land Reform, Two Years of Great Production Movement
    Northeast China Eliminates Summer Grain Shortages
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 12th) This summer, farmers in the vast rural areas of Northeast China have basically eliminated the grain shortage phenomenon that occurred every year during the "green and yellow not connecting" period. This is one of the results of the great production movement of the farmers in Northeast China in the two years after the land reform. In the three provinces of Northern Manchuria, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, and Jilin, every village and household now has surplus grain. In many areas, farmers also have surplus grain to sell this year in order to purchase production and living necessities. According to the recent estimates of Songjiang Province, the province's farmers have more than 60,000 tons of surplus grain this year. In Heilongjiang District of Yushu County, Jilin Province, with 5,450 households, the average household has more than one shi of surplus grain (one shi is 500 jin, the same below). From October last year to April this year, the Northeast China Grain Company has purchased more than 1.7 million tons of surplus grain from farmers, exceeding the original grain purchase plan by one time. However, farmers in various places still have a large amount of surplus grain for sale. Since the company started to continue purchasing grain in June, it has purchased more than 110,000 tons of grain in just over a month.
    Before the land reform in the rural areas of Northeast China, due to the cruel exploitation by landlords and the Japanese invaders during the puppet Manchurian period, no matter how abundant the harvest, there was a shortage of grain in June and July every year. During this period, most farmers used wild vegetables, leaves, and bran to fill their stomachs. After the land reform, due to the gradual recovery and development of agricultural production, the serious phenomenon of grain shortage in summer for farmers has gradually decreased, but the people's government still needs to issue a batch of loan grain every year to survive. This situation has changed greatly this year. During the busy summer hoeing season, grain carts passed by on the village roads in an endless stream, and the market was filled with various grains for sale in the market towns. In the one month of summer hoeing in Xi'an County, Liaodong Province, farmers sold more than 630,000 jin of grain through cooperatives.
    Due to the large amount of grain accumulated by farmers in Northeast China, their lives have also been greatly improved. The Li Jinzhang mutual aid group in Shuangquan Village, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, implemented intensive farming and expanded the cultivated land area after the land reform. Last year, each labor force harvested more than 50 shi of grain. During this year's summer hoeing, they ate dry rice almost every meal, and every family had surplus grain. Cao Fu, a farmer in Acheng County, Songjiang Province, with a family of six, used to finish eating grain in April before the land reform, but this year he had three shi of grain left in mid-July after finishing the land shovel. Dong Lanchen, who had lived as a beggar for more than ten years in Donggu Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, now lives as prosperous as other farmers, and now has more than two shi of grain in the warehouse. Due to the abundance of grain, the desire of farmers in various places to have strong people and strong horses has been realized, thus ensuring the completion of the plan for more shovels and more trips this summer.

### 土改后经过两年大生产运动  东北消除夏季缺粮现象

　　土改后经过两年大生产运动
    东北消除夏季缺粮现象
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】今年夏季东北广大农村的农民已经基本上消灭了往年青黄不接的缺粮现象。这是东北农民在土地改革以后经过两年来大生产运动的成果之一。北满黑龙江、松江、吉林三省现在村村户户都有余粮。很多地区的农民今年还有余粮出卖，以便购买生产和生活必需品。据松江省最近的估计：该省农民今年还有余粮六万余吨。吉林省榆树县五千四百五十余户的黑林子区，平均每户存有余粮一石以上（每石五百斤，下同）。东北区粮食公司从去年十月到今年四月，已收购了农民的余粮达一百七十余万吨，超过原购粮计划的一倍。但至今各地农民手中还有大量余粮待售。该公司自六月份开始继续购粮以来，仅一个多月内即已购到粮食十一万余吨。
    东北农村在土地改革以前，由于受地主和伪满时期日寇的残酷剥削，不论如何丰收，每年六、七月间粮食均感缺乏，在此期间农民大都以野菜、树叶和糠麩等充饥。土地改革以后，由于农业生产的逐渐恢复和发展，农民夏季缺粮的严重现象已逐渐减少，但还需人民政府每年发放一批贷粮始能度过。在今年，这种情况已大大改变。在繁忙的夏锄季节里，乡村大道上过往粮车络绎不绝，集镇上各种待售的谷物充满了市场。辽东省西安县夏锄期间一个月中，农民通过合作社出卖的粮食，即有六十三万余斤。
    由于东北农民积余大批粮食，因而生活也大大改善。黑龙江省讷河县双泉村李金章互助组因土地改革后实行精耕细作及扩大耕地面积，去年平均每个劳动力收获了五十余石粮，在今年夏锄中，几乎顿顿吃干饭，而且家家有余粮。松江省阿城县农民曹福六口之家，土地改革前每年粮食吃到四月就完，今年到七月中旬铲完地后还剩三石粮食。吉林省舒兰县东孤村过了十余年乞丐生活的董兰臣，如今生活也和其他农民一样富裕，现存在仓中的粮食有二石多。由于粮食的充裕，各地农民的人强马壮的愿望已经实现，因而保证了今夏多铲多趟计划的完成。
