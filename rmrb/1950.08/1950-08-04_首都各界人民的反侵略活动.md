The movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea is deeply unfolding among people of all classes and circles in the capital.

    Fifth District
    Before "August 1st," the Fifth District Anti-American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea Committee received more than 500 letters from people in the district to the People's Liberation Army and the Korean People's Army. These letters fully expressed the confidence of people from all walks of life in liberating Taiwan and the joy of the Korean people's victory. In their letters to the People's Liberation Army, Hongye Tannery and railway workers said: Our worker brothers are determined to combine our enthusiastic production with your battle, and work together to liberate Taiwan! In letters to the Korean People's Army, Wang Keqin and Ma Xiuying said: "We believe that you will surely complete the great cause of liberation soon. ... Comrades, go ahead! Light and victory are waiting for you!" Han Maoying said on behalf of his family: "The Chinese people and the people of the world are on your side, and all people who love peace, democracy, and freedom in the world are extending hands of support to you. Victory must be yours!"

    Ninth District
    About 300 teachers and students from the children's literacy classes, women's groups, and adult supplementary schools in the Ninth District organized four Yangko and waist drum propaganda teams to promote the cause on the streets for three days. Some propaganda teams also combined this with a signature campaign to defend world peace. 277 people signed, and about 4,000 people listened. (Miao Tinghu)
    Twentieth District
    The Twentieth District of the Beijing suburbs held a movement rally against American imperialist aggression on the afternoon of July 27th. More than 3,600 workers, farmers, women, and students, holding high the banners against aggression, entered the venue in formation. After Lin Tong, secretary of the CPC District Committee, explained the significance of the conference, worker representative Li Yushen, farmer representative Cao Jinbao, and women's representative Zhou Fengzhen took the stage to speak, calling on everyone to work hard in production and support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions and support the Korean people in repelling American imperialism. The meeting also adopted a telegram of congratulations to General Kim Il-sung, leader of the Korean people, and all the soldiers and civilians of Korea. After the meeting, a street parade and demonstration was held with red flags waving and drums and gongs sounding.

    Members of the Fifth Branch of the Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union and the Seventh Telephone Bureau
    All employees of the Fifth Branch of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union sent a letter to the China Peace Preservation Congress, expressing their determination to oppose American aggression. The letter stated: "All our members resolutely support your proposition. At the inaugural meeting of the Fifth Branch Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, we organized all employees with a production-oriented trade union work policy, responding to the new aggression of American imperialism with practical actions in production. We believe that the peace and democratic forces of the world will surely defeat the new aggression of American imperialism in Asia."
    A letter from all members of the Seventh Telephone Bureau of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union to the Beijing Municipal People's Committee Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea stated: "In a mood of anger, in order to protest the aggressive actions of American imperialism, we are willing to respond to the call of the trade union with practical actions, voluntarily working overtime outside of production time to complete the current important task - inventorying equipment. We will give full play to the enthusiasm of workers and their attitude as masters of the house, and build people's enterprises. We will use this practical strength to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army and aid the Korean liberation war."
    Vendors of Beigouyan
    More than 800 vendors in the Beigouyan Market in the Fourth District held a symposium against American aggression on the 28th. 441 people signed the peace declaration on the spot. Cheng Songbin, a soy sauce vendor in the Beigouyan Market, said freely: "The Korean People's Army's resistance to the aggressors is completely just and represents the will of all the Korean people. Therefore, they will surely win!"

    Experimental Zone for Maternal and Child Health
    The Beijing Municipal Experimental Zone for Maternal and Child Health organized more than 300 members of the five mothers' associations that had been established, and held six meetings separately. Women activists and group leaders disregarded their own family affairs and cooperated to carry out propaganda among the scattered residents, persuading a part of the masses with unclear understanding. Signatures were initiated at the meetings. During this period, 826 women signed. (Ge Baolin, He Rong)
