　　Korean People Use All Their Strength to Support the People's Army to Achieve Victory
　　Xinhua News Agency Korean Frontline Reporter's Dispatch
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th] Our frontline special correspondent reports: The United States' two objectives of "saturation bombing" have not been achieved. It has not destroyed the Korean people's animosity, but has instead strengthened it. It also has not affected the military supply of the People's Army.
　　Near the front lines, one can get the impression of how much the Korean people love their army, and how determined they are to provide all the conditions to ensure their army can achieve victory. Here, from the moment dusk falls until the sun banishes the darkness from the roads, almost the entire rural population is moving in both north and south directions on the roads.
　　On small paths, on side roads, on mountain trails, and on thousands of roads that American planes cannot reach, the Korean people are transporting ammunition and food for their army. They carry these things on their shoulders, in ox carts, and on handcarts, supplementing the deficiencies of the normal supply routes.
　　While some of the people are persisting in this great transportation work, another equally large group is carrying out reconstruction work at night. Their speed and skill are astonishing. The damage suffered during the day is promptly and effectively repaired overnight. No matter what the Americans attempt, they can never catch up with the people's speed.
　　These volunteer workers, farmers, and urban residents are simply countless. There are always more people than needed for the work, and more volunteers are joining at any time. They do not take any remuneration, and they themselves serve as military guards, making it difficult to attack them from the air.
　　The American boasts of cutting off the People's Army's supply lines with jet planes are ridiculous and not worth considering. No jet plane or any other fighter or bomber can harm such a vast transportation network, and the repair workers who completely disperse into the countryside at dawn, leaving the Americans to bomb blindly and foolishly.
　　When the People's Army needs food, the local people compete to supply it. They say, "Every mile the People's Army advances guarantees the realization of land reform, and later we will eat well. These people are fighting for us, and as long as we have a grain of food left, they will certainly have something to eat."
　　Two nights ago, I followed a People's Army sentry and climbed a hillside to look out over a section of this transportation network. We sat on the hillside. First came an ox cart, pulled by four people who struggled to get it through the difficult places. The cart was loaded with boxes of mortar shells. Not far below the mountain, at a bend in the road, we could only see the shadows of a large group of people in the moonlight, who quickly came up, and it was clear that they were carrying food on their backs. When they met us, they stopped to rest and talk.
　　Most of them were farmers, very concerned about the implementation of land reform. But there were also several city people.
　　One of these people said, "My house was bombed by American planes two weeks ago, and my wife and two children were killed. Helping the army is my way of taking revenge." Another person said, "I came all the way from Pyongyang to join the army, but they said there were already too many young people wanting to join. Therefore, I am doing this work now, and I will not go back until victory."

### 人民的战争  朝鲜人民用一切力量支援人民军取得胜利

　　人民的战争
    朝鲜人民用一切力量支援人民军取得胜利
    新华社朝鲜战地记者报道
    【新华社平壤七日电】本社战地特派记者报道：美国“饱和轰炸”的两个目标都没有达到。它没有破坏得了朝鲜人民的敌忾心，却反而加强了这种敌忾心。它也并没有影响到人民军的军事供应。
    在接近前线的地方，你可能得到一个印象：朝鲜人民是多么爱护他们的军队，而且他们决心提供一切条件，保证他们的军队能够获得胜利。在这里，从黄昏降临的时刻起，直到太阳从道路上驱除了黑暗的时候止，差不多整个乡村的居民都在道路上向南北两个方向移动。
    在小路上，在侧道上，在山路上，以及在成千条的美国飞机所碰不到的路上，朝鲜人民为他们的军队运送着军火和食粮。他们将这些东西扛在肩上，放在牛车上，手推车上，补充了正常供应路线的不足。
    当一部分人民坚持着这种伟大的运输工作时，另一部分同样众多的人民就在夜晚进行重建工作。他们的速度和技巧是惊人的。白天所受到的破坏，在一夜之间就及时地而且极有效地修复了。不管美国人有什么企图，他们总赶不上人民的速度。
    这些志愿的工人、农民和城市居民群众，简直数也数不清。总是有超过工作所需要的人，而且随时有更多的人志愿参加。他们都不取报酬，他们自己担任军事守卫，要从空中袭击他们，是不容易的。
    美国吹嘘要用喷气飞机来切断人民军的供应线，这种吹牛是太可笑了，简直不值一顾。没有任何喷气飞机或任何其他战斗机或轰炸机，能够危害这样广大的运输网，和黎明时便完全分散到乡间去的修复工人，他们让美国人盲目而愚蠢地轰炸着。
    当人民军队需要粮食的时候，当地人民便争先供给。他们说：“人民军每一英里的推进，都保证了土地改革的实现，以后我们将要吃得好起来。这些人是为我们而战斗的，只要我们还有一粒粮食，他们就一定有吃的。”
    两晚以前，我曾随着人民军哨兵爬上一处山腰，了望这个运输网的一线。我们坐在山腰上。首先来了一辆牛车，四个人拉着它经过困难的地方。车上载有迫击炮弹的箱子。山下面不远之处，在路的一个转弯地点，我们在月光中仅仅看到一大群人民的影子，这些人很快就走上来，看得出他们正背着食品。当他们碰着我们的时候，便停下来休息并交谈了。
    他们大半是农民，很关心土地改革的实行。但也有若干人是城市人民。
    这些人当中有一个人说：“我的房子在两个星期前被美国飞机炸毁了，我的老婆和两个小孩都被炸死了。帮助军队，这就是我报仇的方法。”另外一个人说：“我从平壤一直走到这儿来打算参加军队，但是他们说已经有太多的青年要参军。因此，我现在就做这个工作，不到胜利的时候，我就不回去。”
