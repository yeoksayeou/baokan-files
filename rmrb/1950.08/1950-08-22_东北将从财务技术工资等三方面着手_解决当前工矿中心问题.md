Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 18th: Strengthening economic accounting to improve product quality and reduce costs is the central issue in the current management of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China. To address this issue, state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China will mainly focus on the following three aspects: strengthening financial management and cost accounting, improving technical management, and gradually implementing a piece-rate wage system.

This year, the main problem in financial management in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China is the serious accumulation of working capital. There are two main reasons for this: First, some units over-stock raw materials, many of which are not needed by the unit. For example, mechanical, electrical, paper, and textile units store a lot of steel needed by the Anshan and Benxi Iron and Steel Plants; second, the quality of many units' products is not high, or the specifications are not met, and there is a disconnect with demand, resulting in product backlog and affecting capital turnover. Therefore, the Northeast Industry Department requires all factories and mines to resolutely correct the above phenomena, strive to shorten the reserve process in production, rationally adjust production organization, reduce waste of labor, and improve product quality to meet needs. The foundation of financial management lies in establishing a sound cost accounting system. In the past, factories and mines had preliminary solutions to the difficulties in calculating complex methods in this area, but the current serious phenomena of inaccurate and untimely calculations still need to be improved in the future.

The main purpose of improving technical management is to improve the quality of products and construction projects; this is a necessary condition for reducing costs. Since the establishment of the production responsibility system in Northeast China's factories and mines, there have been improvements in this area. For example, the products of Anshan Iron and Steel Plant now fully meet the specifications, but the phenomenon of low quality still exists in many factories, especially the situation where construction projects do not meet engineering quality is even more serious. Now the Northeast Industry Department requires all factories and mines to effectively establish "technical" and "quality" responsibility systems, in order to gradually and systematically establish a strict technical management system from now on; at the same time, actively promote the production experience of the Ma Hengchang team and carry out mass movements to improve quality. In the management of construction projects, it is required to establish a scientific system from the review of engineering design to the completion and acceptance of the project.

When industrial construction is on the right track, implementing a piece-rate wage system in enterprises is an important method to promote the continuous rise of labor productivity. After finding a relatively reasonable technical quota through the new record-breaking movement, many factories and mines in Northeast China have gradually improved the original wage system based on this; since June this year, the Northeast State-owned Industry has implemented an eight-grade wage system. According to this system, the average wage of employees has increased by 8% compared with the end of last year; the wages of technical personnel have increased by an average of 38.9%. Now the Northeast People's Government is preparing to gradually implement a piece-rate wage system and reward system based on the eight-grade wage system, so that the production enthusiasm of employees can always reach fullness.

The reason why Northeast China's industrial construction can now implement the above improvement measures more comprehensively is that it has created the necessary conditions after going through three different stages. These three stages are: (1) From December 1948 to July last year, after receiving, clearing, and rectifying, a unified management organization was established and production was restored. (2) From July last year to February this year, through anti-waste and new record-breaking movements, labor efficiency was improved, reaching the production level that should be achieved under existing technical conditions, partially creating new working methods and changing old technologies, and finding preliminary technical quotas. And on this basis, the production and basic construction plan for 1950 was formulated. (3) Since February this year, industrial construction work has begun to shift to consolidating the results of the new record-breaking movement from the aspect of improving the management system, such as establishing a production responsibility system, implementing a security responsibility system, changing to an eight-grade wage system, and establishing independent accounting systems and systematic basic departments for each factory and mine. And the central work in the past periods was achieved by relying on the active participation of the working class.

　　东北将从财务技术工资等三方面着手
    解决当前工矿中心问题
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】加强经济核算以提高产品质量、减低成本，这是东北国营工矿业当前经营管理工作的中心问题。为解决这一问题，东北各地国营工矿业主要地将从以下三方面着手，即：加强财务管理和成本核算，改进技术管理，逐步推行计件工资制。
    今年以来，东北国营工矿业在财务管理方面的主要问题是流动资金的积压现象甚为严重。其主要原因有二：一是有些单位过多地储备原材料，其中有许多是本单位所不需要者。如机械、电业、造纸、纺织等单位中却储存很多鞍山本溪钢铁厂所需的厂钢；一是不少单位的产品因质量不高或规格不合，和需要脱节，使产品积压，影响资金周转。因此东北工业部要求各厂矿切实纠正上述现象，力求缩短生产中的储备过程，合理调整生产组织；减少劳动力的浪费，改进产品质量，使之适合需要。财务管理的基础，在于健全成本核算制度。过去各厂矿对这方面较复杂的计算方法困难已获初步解决，但当前严重存在着的计算的不准确和不及时的现象，仍待以后改进。
    改进技术管理的主要目的，在于提高产品和修建工程的质量；这是减低成本的必要条件。东北各厂矿自建立生产责任制以后，这方面已有改进。如鞍山钢铁厂的产品，现已全部合乎规格，但质量不高的现象仍在许多工厂存在，特别是修建工程中不合工程质量的情况更加严重。现东北工业部要求各厂矿切实建立“技术”和“质量”责任制，以便从此逐渐地系统地建立起严格的技术管理制度；同时积极推广马恒昌小组的生产经验，开展群众性的提高质量的运动。在修建工程的管理上，则要求从工程设计的审查到交工验收为止，建立一套科学的制度。
    当工业建设走上正轨后，在企业中实行计件工资制是促进劳动生产率不断上升的重要方法。东北国营厂矿自经过创造新纪录运动找到比较合理的技术定额以后，不少厂矿曾据此逐渐改善了原来的工资制度；今年六月开始，东北国营工业又实行了八级工资制。根据这一制度，职工平均工资比去年年底提高了百分之八；技术人员的工资则平均提高百分之三十八点九。现东北人民政府更准备以八级工资制为基础，逐步推行计件工资制和奖励制度，以使职工生产情绪经常达到饱满。
    东北的工业建设目前所以能够较全面地实行上述改进措施，是由于经过过去三个不同阶段，创造了必要条件。这三个阶段是：（一）一九四八年十二月到去年七月，经过接收、清理、整顿等工作，建立了统一的管理机构，恢复了生产。（二）自去年七月到今年二月，经过反浪费到创造新纪录运动，提高了劳动效率，达到在现有技术条件下应有的生产水平，部分地创造了新的工作方法和改变了旧的技术，找到了初步的技术定额。并在这一基础上，制定了一九五○年的生产和基本建设计划。（三）今年二月以来，工业建设工作即开始转向从改进管理制度方面来巩固创造新纪录运动的成果，如建立生产责任制，贯彻保安责任制，改行八级工资制，建立各厂矿独立会计制度和系统的基本部门等。而过去各个时期的中心工作，又是依靠工人阶级的积极参加而实现的。
