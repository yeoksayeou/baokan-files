My dear friends! We are celebrating our great Chinese people's holiday, the "August 1st" Army Day, with joy and excitement!

Let us salute the heroic and invincible five million People's Liberation Army heroes! Let us salute the supporters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, our mother, the Chinese people! Let us salute our great leader, the genius creator and organizer of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the helmsman of the Chinese people's victory, Chairman Mao!

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, has fought bravely for twenty-three years since the Nanchang Uprising on August 1, 1927, for the liberation of the nation and society. As a result of these twenty-three years of struggle, the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China has been basically overthrown, and all the land and people except Tibet and Taiwan have been liberated, realizing the great cause of democratic unity of the Chinese people. The new People's Republic of China has thus stood in the world. People all over the world are celebrating this historical and great victory with the same joy as we are!

The People's Army has undergone a long and arduous struggle to achieve what it is today. From the Nanchang Uprising to the period of the Jinggangshan meeting, it was only a guerrilla force of less than 6,000 people. From then on, with the Jiangxi base area as the center, it launched guerrilla warfare on the borders of various provinces north and south of the Yangtze River, successively established its own base areas, and smashed Chiang Kai-shek's many encirclements and suppressions supported by imperialism. At the end of 1934, in order to concentrate the Red Army throughout the country to go north to resist Japan, it experienced the Long March of 25,000 li, endured countless hardships, smashed the enemy's obstacles, and finally arrived at the anti-Japanese forward position in northern Shaanxi in early 1936. During the War of Resistance, under the fierce and barbaric repeated sweeps, killings, and looting by the Japanese invaders and the pincer attacks by Chiang Kai-shek's capitulationists, it established many anti-Japanese base areas in North China, Central China, South China, and the rear of the enemy in Northeast China, persisted in heroic and arduous struggles, eliminated a large number of Japanese and puppet troops, and became the pillar of the War of Resistance, while at the same time strengthening itself in the cruel struggle against the Japanese invaders. At the beginning of the Patriotic War of Liberation, the Kuomintang had a total of 4.3 million troops in the army, navy, and air force, and constantly received various assistance from American imperialism; while the People's Liberation Army had only 1.28 million troops at that time, with no air force or navy, and very few cannons. Under such circumstances, in order to avoid the attacks of superior enemies, the People's Liberation Army took the initiative to abandon many cities, implemented large-scale advances and retreats, and strived to concentrate its forces to annihilate the enemy in mobile warfare. The difficulties at that time were serious. However, the People's Liberation Army overcame the difficulties with perseverance, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's policy of annihilation warfare, and thus continuously annihilated the enemy by whole brigades, divisions, and armies, seized a large amount of enemy equipment to equip itself, cultivated its own artillery from the captured equipment, and built its own engineering corps. Up to now, it has developed into a powerful force of five million people, thousands of new-style cannons, and other modern weapons, and has begun to have its own people's air force and navy. In the past twenty-three years, it has experienced countless tests, suffered many setbacks and hardships, but it has never succumbed to the enemy, fought stubbornly with the enemy, and finally defeated the enemy and become an invincible force.

Why was the People's Liberation Army able to achieve such a great victory today?

First of all, because it is an army of the people. It was armed and organized by the Chinese people for their own liberation. The Chinese people deeply understand the basic characteristic of "armed people opposing armed counter-revolution" as stated by Marshal Stalin, and understand the truth stated by Chairman Mao that "without armed struggle in China, there would be no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, no status for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution," so they actively participated in and enthusiastically supported the People's Liberation Army. All the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army consciously fought for the interests of the broad masses of the people. The army and the people are inseparably linked by flesh and blood, forming an extremely broad people's war in the struggle against the enemy. This is the source of its growing strength and invincibility.

Secondly, this army was built from the very beginning under the diligent cultivation and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao deeply understood the special and enormous importance of armed struggle in the Chinese revolution; therefore, he has always been concerned about the construction and growth of this army for the past twenty-three years. He established the sole purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly for the army, and established the strong core leadership of the Communist Party in this army. Chairman Mao, with his deep understanding of Marxism-Leninism and his familiarity with the Chinese situation, formulated the strategy, tactics, and revolutionary political work of the Chinese revolutionary war. The Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention were personally formulated by Chairman Mao in the Jinggangshan era. The resolution of the Ninth Congress of the Fourth Red Army written by Chairman Mao is the most important document for our army building and the political work of the troops. The People's Liberation Army follows these instructions, greatly improves its political consciousness and revolutionary spirit, and truly achieves unity between officers and soldiers and unity between the army and the people, uniting internally to defeat the enemy. Chairman Mao personally participated in all the important measures of the army's combat deployment, education, and training. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army implements the correct military and political line, thereby gaining the support of the people. This is the basic factor for its development, growth, and continuous victory.

Today, after the basic victory of the Chinese People's War of Liberation and the establishment of a new, democratically unified China, the broad masses of our motherland are striving for better economic conditions and are beginning to strive to build a prosperous, strong, and industrialized country. Obviously, we cannot be complacent because of victory; our victory is only the first step in a long march. Engaging in the construction of the country will require greater efforts and extremely arduous and serious struggles than the past twenty-odd years of war. This is not only because the old China was originally an economically and culturally very backward country, and we are building the most advanced country under the conditions of a large country; but also because the vicious enemy, American imperialism, is still gesticulating beside us, plotting new and despicable aggressions against our China at all times, supporting the last struggles of the Kuomintang remnant bandits in Taiwan, and carrying out new world war provocations. At present, American imperialism openly invades Korea with armed forces, controls Taiwan, and further carries out barbaric military adventures, posing a greater threat to our sacred territory, border areas, and construction undertakings. This clearly shows that under the conditions of the existence of imperialism in the world, it is impossible for us to carry out economic construction without worry, and we should not think so. In the long-term future, the construction and development of China's armed forces will still have great importance and necessity. In order to "defend China's independence and territorial integrity, defend the revolutionary achievements and all legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people," and to defend our country's great economic construction, oppose new imperialist aggression, "our people's armed forces must be preserved and developed, we will not only have a strong army, but also a strong air force and a strong navy." The commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions, establish the idea that the People's Liberation Army is always a fighting team, promote a high degree of patriotism, and always stand on the forefront of national defense! Resolutely complete the great tasks of eliminating the remaining enemies, thoroughly smashing the aggressive conspiracies of American imperialism, defending the border areas, consolidating national defense, defending the people's motherland, and defending world peace!

Our Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and with the support of the people of the whole country, will certainly be able to successfully carry out new and great tasks as in the past. Facts constantly expose the vicious American imperialism as a paper tiger, and irreconcilable contradictions exist and develop within the imperialist camp. On our side, the world anti-aggression camp led by the Soviet Union already has a huge advantage; our Chinese people have the strength to defeat the Japanese imperialist bandits and the strength to eliminate the powerful reactionary group of Chiang Kai-shek, the running dog of American imperialism. Today, we have trained a heroic and powerful People's Liberation Army that is rare in the world. We have no doubt that we can stand on the forefront of the motherland, stand on the side of the world anti-aggression camp, and strive to smash the aggressive conspiracies of imperialism, defend the motherland, and defend world peace!

In welcoming the new and great tasks today, in order to build a strong national defense army, the troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army must strengthen education in patriotism and highly promote the revolutionary tradition of the people's army in loving the motherland and loving the people. The spirit of patriotism will be the greatest spiritual force to inspire us to build a strong national defense army. Our spirit of patriotism is completely integrated with the spirit of internationalism of uniting with the people of the world to oppose imperialism. The direction of the Soviet people, the fortress of world peace, is a model of patriotism for our Chinese people. At the same time, our entire army must actively study culture, increase cultural and scientific knowledge, further study Chairman Mao's military thought, study the Soviet Union's military construction, and transform our army into a huge school, thereby rapidly improving our military level, improving our ability to master new arms and various technologies, and building our army into a completely modernized and more powerful and invincible armed force, becoming a reliable pillar for defending the motherland and defending world peace. We will grasp the weapons in our hands and strengthen our combat power without stopping for a moment. We will vigilantly guard against imperialist aggressors without any negligence, defend our motherland, and stand on the forefront of national defense! If the imperialist bandits dare to provoke a new war of aggression, we will surely give them a devastating blow! We will forever hold high the victorious banner of Mao Zedong and advance! Victory will always belong to us!

　　我们永远站在国防最前线
    （在北京各界青年庆祝“八一”大会上的讲话）
    人民革命军事委员会总政治部副主任  萧华
    亲爱的朋友们！我们以欢欣鼓舞与胜利的心情来庆祝我们中国人民伟大的节日“八一”建军节！
    让我们向英勇无敌的五百万人民解放军的英雄们致敬！向中国人民解放军的抚养者，我们的母亲中国人民致敬！向我们中国人民伟大的领袖，中国人民解放军天才的创造者和组织者，中国人民胜利的舵手毛主席致敬！
    中国人民解放军为了民族与社会的解放，在中国共产党和毛主席、朱总司令领导之下，自一九二七年八月一日南昌起义起，到现在已经英勇作战二十三年。这二十三年奋战的结果，基本上推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的反动统制，解放了除西藏、台湾以外的全部国土和人民，实现了中国人民民主统一的大业。新的中华人民共和国已经由此站立在世界上。全世界的人民都和我们一样在欢欣若狂的来庆祝这一历史性的伟大的胜利！
    这支人民的军队所以有今天，曾经历了长期的艰苦斗争。从南昌起义到井岗山会合的时期，它还只是一支不到六千人的游击队。从那时起，它以江西根据地为中心，在长江南北的诸省边界展开了游击战争，陆续建立了自己的根据地，粉碎了帝国主义支持下的蒋介石多次的围剿。一九三四年末，为了集中全国红军北上抗日，曾经经历过二万五千里路的长征，经历千辛万苦，粉碎了敌人的阻拦，终于在一九三六年初到达陕北的抗日前进阵地。抗战时期，在日本侵略者凶恶野蛮的反复扫荡、烧杀、抢掠和蒋介石投降派的夹击之下，它在华北、华中、华南与东北敌人后方，建立了许多抗日根据地，坚持着英勇艰苦的斗争，消灭了大量的日伪军，成为抗战的支柱，同时在和日寇的残酷的斗争中壮大了自己。爱国解放战争开始时，国民党共有陆、海、空军兵力总计四百三十万人，并且不断的获得了美帝国主义的各种援助；而人民解放军当时只有一百二十八万人，既没有空军、海军，大炮也为数极少。在此种情况下，人民解放军为了避开优势敌人的打击，曾经主动的放弃许多城市，实行大踏步的进退，力求集中兵力在运动中歼灭敌人。当时的困难是严重的。然而人民解放军以坚韧的毅力战胜了困难，坚决的执行了毛主席歼灭战的方针，从而连续的整旅、整师、整军的歼灭了敌人，大量的夺取了敌人的装备而装备了自己，从缴获中培养了自己的炮兵，建设了自己的工兵，以至今日，它已发展成为拥有五百万人，数千门新式大炮及其他各种近代武器的强大部队，并已开始有了人民自己的空军和海军。二十三年来，它经历了无数次的考验，遭受过不少的挫折和困苦，但是它从来没有在敌人面前屈服，顽强的同敌人作战，以至今日，终于打倒了敌人，成为不可战胜的力量。
    人民解放军为什么能够取得今天这样大的胜利呢？
    首先因为它是一支人民的军队。它是中国人民为自求解放而武装起来，组织起来的。中国人民深深懂得了斯大林大元帅所说的“武装的人民反对武装的反革命”的这个基本特点，体会了毛主席所说的“在中国离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利”的真理，所以积极的参加和热烈的支援人民解放军。全体的人民解放军指挥员战斗员，都自觉的为广大人民群众的利益而战。军队和人民血肉不可分离的连接在一起，而形成为对敌斗争中极其广泛的人民战争，这就是它所以日益壮大与不可战胜的力量的源泉。
    其次，这支军队，它一开始就是在中国共产党和它的领袖毛主席辛勤培植与正确领导之下建设起来的。毛主席深深的理解武装斗争在中国革命中特殊巨大的重要性；因此二十三年来他无时不在关心着这支军队的建设壮大。他确立了全心全意为人民服务为军队的唯一宗旨，在这支军队中建立起共产党坚强的核心领导。毛主席以他对马列主义深切的了解和对中国情况的熟知结合起来，规定了中国革命战争的战略、战术、和革命的政治工作。三条纪律，八项注意，是毛主席在井岗山时代亲手订的，毛主席所写的红四军第九次代表大会的决议案，是我们建军和建设部队政治工作最重要的文献。人民解放军遵循着这些指示，大大提高了政治觉悟和革命精神，真正做到了官兵一致、军民一致，团结内部战胜敌人。毛主席亲自参与了军队的作战布置和教育训练的一切重要措施。人民解放军在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，执行正确的军事和政治路线，从而获得人民的拥护支持。这就是它所以发展壮大、连续取胜的基本因素。
    今天在中国人民解放战争基本胜利、民主统一的新中国已经成立之后，我们祖国的广大人民正在争取经济情况的更加好转，正在开始为建设一个繁荣的、强盛的、工业化的国家而奋斗。显然的我们不能因为胜利而自满，我们的胜利还仅是万里长征的第一步。我们从事国家的建设事业，比起过去二十余年的战争，将要付出更大的努力，将要经历极其艰巨和严重的斗争。这不仅因为旧中国原是个经济上文化上非常落后的国家，我们乃是在这一个大国的条件下建设最先进的国家；而且因为凶恶的敌人美帝国主义还在我们的旁边指手划脚，时时刻刻在策划着向我们中国进行卑鄙的新的侵略，支持国民党残余匪帮在台湾的最后挣扎，和进行新的世界战争挑衅。目前美帝国主义公开的以武装力量侵略朝鲜，控制台湾，进一步实行了野蛮的军事冒险，造成了对我神圣领土边疆与建设事业的更大威胁。这清楚的说明了在世界上存在着帝国主义的条件下，我们想高枕无忧的进行经济建设是不可能的，也是不应该这样想的，在今后长远的时期中，中国人民武装力量的建设和发展，仍将有极大的重要性和必要性。为“保卫中国的独立和领土主权的完整，保卫中国人民的革命成果和一切合法权益”，为保卫我们国家的伟大的经济建设事业，反对帝国主义新的侵略，“我们的人民武装力量必须保存和发展起来，我们将不但有一个强大的陆军，而且有一个强大的空军和强大的海军”。中国人民解放军的指挥员战斗员，应该坚决执行毛主席的指示，树立人民解放军永远是一个战斗队的思想，发扬高度的爱国主义的精神，永远站在国防的最前线！坚决完成消灭残余敌人、彻底粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋、保卫边疆、巩固国防、保卫人民祖国、保卫世界和平的伟大任务！
    我们中国人民解放军，在毛主席领导之下，在全国人民支援之下，将一定能像过去一样胜利的执行新的伟大任务。事实不断戳穿凶恶的美帝国主义是一只纸老虎，帝国主义阵营内部存在和发展着不可调和的矛盾。而我们方面，以苏联为首的世界反侵略阵营，已居巨大的优势；我们中国人民有战胜日本帝国主义强盗的力量，有消灭美帝国主义走狗蒋介石强大反动集团的力量，今天已经锻炼出一支世界少有的英勇和强大的人民解放军，我们毫不怀疑能够站在祖国的最前线，站在世界反侵略阵营的一边，为粉碎帝国主义的侵略阴谋、保卫祖国、保卫世界和平而奋斗！
    在迎接新的伟大任务的今天，为了建设强大的国防军，中国人民解放军各部队要加强爱国主义的教育，高度发扬人民军队热爱祖国、热爱人民的革命传统。爱国主义精神将是鼓舞我们建设强大国防军的最大精神力量。我们这种爱国主义精神，是和全世界人民团结起来反对帝国主义的国际主义精神完全结合一致的。世界和平堡垒苏联人民的方向，正是我们中国人民爱国主义的榜样。同时我们全军一定要积极的学习文化，增加文化科学知识，进一步学习毛主席的军事思想，学习苏联的军事建设，把我们的军队形成为巨大的学校，由此迅速的提高军事水平，提高掌握新式兵种和各种技术的能力，把我们的军队建设成为完全近代化的，更加强大无敌的武装力量，成为保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的一支可靠的支柱。我们将一刻不停的握紧手中的武器，增强自己的战斗力量。我们将毫不疏忽的警惕着帝国主义侵略者，捍卫自己的祖国，站在国防的最前线！帝国主义强盗们假使敢于挑动新的侵略战争，我们必将给以毁灭的打击！我们将永远高举毛泽东胜利的旗帜前进！胜利永远属于我们！
