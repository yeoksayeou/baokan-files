How to Lead Regular Production Emulation Drives?
    Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Advanced Producer of the Northeast, Zhang Shangju

    A good trade union cadre who does not detach himself from production should not only complete and exceed his own production tasks and become an advanced producer, but also do a good job in trade union work. In the production emulation drives of the past year, the branch of the assembly shop of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory has created unprecedented new records in organizing and leading workers to complete production tasks and improve product quality, guiding the factory to a climax of regular production emulation drives, and winning the glorious title of Model Branch of the factory.

    Work Achievements of the Past Year

    I will give a simple introduction to the work of the assembly shop branch: Before April 1949, the Third Machine Tool Factory was repairing and reconditioning damaged machines, lathes, etc. left in warehouses during the puppet Manchukuo and Kuomintang occupation periods. After April, the factory began regular production of six-foot belt lathes. The factory also gradually established a scientific management system. Fitters were concentrated in the assembly shop. At that time, there were 80 workers and apprentices (now 136) who formed a trade union, divided into 12 production groups. At that time, except for the marking group which had production tasks, the others were preparing production tools. Assembly began in May. The branch launched all the workers in the assembly shop to challenge the whole factory in an emulation drive. In the competition, the assembly shop created a new record for shortening working hours. For example, in April, the original plan was to assemble one lathe in 120 work hours, but the assembly shop only used 102 work hours, and in June it was further reduced to 92 work hours. In November and December, the working hours were 36.3 work hours, and a total of 85 units were assembled in two months (task of 80 units), and an additional five air compressors of 50 horsepower were assembled. In January 1950, the self-reported working hours were 31.3 work hours to assemble one unit. A total of 45 units were assembled that month. In addition, many six-foot boxcar lathe tools were made. In February and March, in response to Chairman Gao Gang's call for quality first, the assembly quality immediately improved, and each unit was inspected and qualified by the Industrial Bureau and stamped with a steel seal. The assembly working hours were 39 work hours (this is the standard working hours for improving quality). The working hours for assembling one six-foot all-gear lathe in February this year were 90 work hours, which was reduced to 72.78 work hours in April. In May, it was further reduced to 67 work hours. The task for June was 20 all-gear lathes, exceeding the task by one unit, and the quality eliminated substandard products. From the above figures, we can see the achievements of the assembly shop branch in launching production emulation drives: greatly shortening working hours and improving product quality.

   How did the trade union in the assembly shop achieve these results?

    The trade union strengthened the organization, established a weekly workshop production meeting and a twice-a-day production "brainstorming session" to solve key problems in production; established a regular system for groups to report problems at any time, which played a very good role in ensuring production, and solved many problems in the trade union work in the past year. Let's first talk about how the trade union encouraged the assembly shop to challenge the whole factory in a production emulation drive.

    In July 1949, the administration arranged the production task for August to be 25 six-foot overhead lathes. The branch held a mass meeting to call on all members to guarantee the completion of the task. After the assembly shop branch cadres returned to the workshop, they immediately went to the groups to mobilize everyone to discuss. As a result, the marking group proposed to guarantee 30 units, the Ren Binggong slide group guaranteed to complete the task and shorten working hours by 17 percent, and other groups voluntarily reduced working hours, all guaranteeing 25 units. After mobilizing all the workers, the trade union cadres took the initiative to discuss with the foreman: "Each group in our shop can complete the task, why not challenge the other departments?" The foreman agreed immediately. After issuing the challenge letter, it quickly aroused the response of the whole factory and promoted the whole factory.

    The assembly shop branch's competition with the whole factory has not stopped from last year to the present. For example, this year, to commemorate the "July 1" anniversary of the Party's birthday, the assembly branch competed with the whole factory to improve quality, guaranteeing that substandard and defective products would be resolutely eliminated in the future, and striving for more than 70 percent of standard products, with the slogan: "Guarantee standard parts come in, standard products go out." They also took the initiative to unite with the technical personnel and put forward the slogan: "If you want every unit to be a standard product, technical personnel please come and rack your brains together (research)."

    The trade union regularly helps workers to improve

    The old worker Fan Xueli has technology and experience, but he has conservative ideas. He often says: "In old China, I earned a dollar a day and ate rice and white flour; now the status of workers has improved, and I only eat one meal of rice a day!" The trade union cadre Zhang Shangju repeatedly told him: "How many factories were there in old China? How many workers could earn a dollar a day? Most of the workers could not get enough to eat and wear. Now there are so many factories in Shenyang, and workers have jobs and food to eat." Lao Fan slowly changed his thinking. In the past, it took eight hours to mark the large frame, but in the new record creation campaign, it was reduced to 54 minutes, and later it was often maintained at two hours and ten minutes. When evaluating wages, the workers who got wage increases were of course very satisfied, but some of those who got wage cuts were dissatisfied. After the worker Tan Shufan's wages were reduced, he could not understand the situation and became emotional, which affected production. According to this situation, the trade union sent several members to help him and told him: "It is not enough to have good technology and not use it. You must use all your technical ability and work more to earn more money." As a result, Lao Tan understood the situation. He said: "Okay, I'll see later!" Now Lao Tan's work is particularly active.

    Branch workshop meetings improve technology

    The marking of the entire belt lathe involves 114 parts. After researching and transforming the tools, only more than 70 large parts remained, creating a new record of 1130 minutes for marking one lathe, and receiving a first-class collective award and a pennant from the Ministry of Industry. In June, the assembly shop itself proposed to assemble 30 all-gear lathes (the task stipulated by the administration was 20 units). Because of the phenomenon of waiting for materials (waiting for ball bearings) occurred in the middle, the materials were waited for from the 5th, and it was not until the 20th that they were bought from Wafangdian (see this newspaper on August 21st). It was already the end of the month when 30 units were assembled, and inspection found that 9 units were substandard. Because it was the end of the month and there was no time to repair them, they had to be repaired and delivered next month. According to this situation, the branch convened a workshop meeting on June 30 to study. The discussion results showed that in addition to waiting for materials and the short time, the inaccuracy of the boring car was also the reason. The spindle hole of the boring car was too tight, and the tolerance was sometimes 18 degrees. When the outer sleeve was put on, it might be scraped off or flattened. When the inner sleeve of the ball bearing was put on the spindle, it needed to be hammered in hard, which might cause deformation of the inner sleeve. After Ren Binggong (chairman of the branch) and Jin Yulin researched and improved the tools, they are being processed. The above examples show that the assembly shop's shortening of working hours is mainly due to the combination of theory and practice. When there is a problem, they study it and improve the tools, instead of relying on increasing labor intensity.

    Establish a production responsibility system

    The assembly shop has had a verbal division of labor since February. After the Ministry of Industry's instructions on the production responsibility system were issued, the branch first cultivated the bed group and created a relatively complete responsibility system, achieving a clear division of labor, and then promoted it to the entire assembly shop. It has now been officially announced by the administration and, after being approved by the masses, has become one of the six systems implemented by the entire factory.

    After May, the branch proposed to implement a tracing inspection responsibility system and established a "Tracing Blackboard News." Whoever is irresponsible will be traced; for example, if the phenomenon of waiting for materials occurs, the branch's cultural and educational committee member Liu Dejia will publish the waiting materials on the "Tracing News" to investigate responsibility, find out the problems, and improve work. The effect of implementing it for several months has been very good, and each time it can attract the attention of relevant departments. The "Tracing News" has attracted the special attention of the administration and the factory trade union, and now a large blackboard has been established, and a system of answering all questions has also been established. After the assembly shop posts the problem of waiting for materials in the question and answer column, the relevant departments immediately reply.

    But the work of the assembly shop branch is not without difficulties. Their difficulty is not the issue of detachment from or non-detachment from production. The main problem is waiting for work and waiting for materials every month, and the lack of parts cannot be solved (workers reflect: too idle at the beginning of the month, too busy at the end of the month), which also shows that the responsibility system of the Third Factory has not been implemented well enough. It is hoped that the administration and trade union of the Third Factory, in particular, will pay attention to solving this big problem. The trade union cadres of the assembly branch should prevent impatience, learn from the masses with an open mind, and always strive to move forward.

　　怎样领导经常性的生产竞赛？
    本报特约通讯员东北先进生产者  张尚举
    一个好的不脱离生产的工会干部，不仅要完成与超过自己的生产任务，成为生产先进者，还要作好工会工作。沈阳机器三厂装配场支会在一年来的生产竞赛中，在组织与领导工友完成生产任务及提高产品质量上，都创造了空前的新纪录，引导工厂走上经常性的生产竞赛的高潮，获得工厂模范支会的光荣称号。
    一年来的工作成绩
    我把装配场支会工作作个简单的介绍：一九四九年四月份以前，第三机器厂是修配伪满及国民党侵占时期扔在仓库的破坏机器、车床等。四月份后，工厂开始正轨生产六尺皮带车床。工厂也逐步建立了科学的管理制度，钳工集中装配场，当时工友徒工共八十名（现为一三六名）成立起工会，分十二个生产组。当时除划线组有生产任务外，其他都是准备生产工具。五月份开始装配，支会发动了装配场全体工友向全厂挑战竞赛。在竞赛中，装配场创造出缩短工时的新纪录。如四月份原计划装一台车床需一二○工，装配厂只用了一○二工，六月份更降为九二工。十一、二两个月工时三十六点三个工，两月共装出八五台（任务八○台），还额外装配五十匹马力的五台空气压缩机。一九五○年一月份自报工时为三一·三工装一台。全月装出四五台。额外还作出不少六尺闷罐车床工具。二、三月份为响应高岗主席质量第一的号召，装配质量马上就提高了，每台都经工业局检查合格，并打了钢印。装配工时为三九工（这是提高质量的标准工时）。六尺全齿轮车床今年二月工时九十工装一台，四月份缩减到工时为七二·七八工。五月份更降为六七工。六月份任务为二十台全齿轮车床，超过任务一台，质量消灭了下级品。从以上的数字，就能看出装配场支会发动生产竞赛的成绩：大大的缩短了工时，提高了产品质量。
   装配场车间工会怎样做出成绩的？
    工会加强了组织，建立起每周一次的车间生产会议，及二天一次生产“碰头会”，解决生产中的关键问题；建立了小组随时发现问题随时汇报的经常制度，对保证生产起了很好的作用，一年来解决了工会工作中不少的问题。先说工会怎样鼓动起装配场向全厂挑起生产竞赛的吧。
    一九四九年七月，行政上布置八月份生产任务是六尺吊挂车床二十五台，分会便召开群众大会号召全体会员保证完成任务，装配场支会干部回到车间后，立刻到小组发动大家讨论，结果划线组提出保证三十台，任秉公溜板组保证完成任务缩短工时百分之十七，其他各组都自动缩减了工时，都要保证二十五台。把全体工友发动起来后，工会干部更主动的同工长商量：“咱们场各个组都能完成任务，为什么不和其他各部挑战？”工长一听很同意，发出挑战书后，很快就引起了全厂的应战，推动了全厂。
    装配厂支会向全厂竞赛，由去年到现在没有停止过。比如今年纪念“七一”党的生日，装配支会向全厂竞赛提高质量，保证今后坚决消灭下级品及不良品，争取百分之七十以上的标级品，提出的口号：“保证标准部件进来，标准品出去”。并主动的和技术人员团结，提出“要想台台标准品，技术人员请来共同费脑筋（研究）”的口号。
    工会经常地帮助工友进步
    老工友范学礼有技术，有经验，就是存在保守思想，动不动就说：“老中国我一天挣一块大洋，吃大米白面；现在工人地位提高了，每天才吃一顿大米饭！”工会干部张尚举三番五次给他讲：“老中国有几个工厂？能挣一块大洋的工人有几个？大多数的工友都吃不饱穿不暖，现在沈阳有这样多的工厂，工人都有工作，有饭吃。”老范慢慢的在思想上转变了，从前划大部架子须八小时，创造新纪录运动中降为五十四分钟，以后经常保持着两点十分。在评工薪时，增加工薪的工友当然很满意，可是降低的就有的不满，谭树番工友降低工薪后，思想就弄不通、闹情绪，影响了生产。根据这情况，工会就派几个委员去帮助他，告诉他：“技术好不拿出来也不行，必须将全部技术能力拿出来，多干活才能多挣钱。”结果老谭思想弄清楚了，他说：“好吧，以后看！”现在老谭的工作特别积极了。
    支会车间会议提高了技术
    划线全台皮带车床为一一四部件，经过研究改造出工具后，只剩七十余大件，创造划一台车床用一一三○分钟的新纪录，受到工业部一等集体奖励及锦标。六月份装配厂自己提出要装三十台全齿轮车床（行政上规定的任务是二十台），因为中间发生待料现象（等滚珠），从五日就待料，直到二十日才由瓦房店买来（详见八月二十一日本报），装配出三十台已到月底，检查有九台下级品。因为已到月底来不及修理，只好放到下月修好再交。根据这种情况，六月三十日支会便召开了车间会议研究，讨论结果除了待料，时间短促外，削孔车不准也是原因，削孔车主轴架眼太紧，公差有的十八道，上外套时可能刮偏或刮扁了。滚珠内套上在主轴上时，需要用力打入，可能引起内套的变形。经任秉公（支会主席）和金雨林研究改进工具后，正在加工中。以上几个实例说明，装配厂缩短工时主要是理论和实际结合起来，有问题就研究就改进工具，不是依靠增加劳动强度。
    创立生产责任制
    装配厂由二月份就有口头分工。工业部关于生产责任制的指示下来以后，支会首先培养了床身组，创造出一套比较完整的责任制度，做到了明确分工，然后推广到全装配厂。现在已为行政上明文公布，经群众通过后，成为全厂执行的六种制度了。
    五月份以后，支会又提出实行追根检查责任制，成立了《追根黑板报》。谁不负责任就追根；如发生待料现象，即由支会文教委员刘德家将待料部件在《追根报》公布出去，以追究责任，找出毛病，改进工作。实行几个月来效果很好，每次都能引起有关部门的注意。《追根报》已引起行政与厂工会的特别重视，现在已作了一块大黑板，还建立了有问必答制度，问答栏中代装配厂登出待料问题后，有关部门就立即答复。
    但装配厂支会工作也不是没有困难的，他们的困难不是脱离生产与不脱离生产的问题，主要问题是月月等工待料，缺少部件没法解决（工友反映：月初闲个要命，月底忙个要命），这也说明三厂责任制贯彻的还不够好。希望三厂行政、工会，特别要注意解决这个大问题。装配支会工会干部要防止急躁，虚心向群众学习，永远努力前进。
