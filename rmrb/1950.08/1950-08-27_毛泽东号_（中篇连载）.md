    VI. Noisy and Raucous Response to the Challenge

    As soon as Shang Baoheng finished reading, one said:
    "Let's compete, who's afraid of whom?"
    Another said:
    "We have an old hero, guaranteed to beat them."
    The old hero said:
    "Then let's have a meeting, everyone discuss it together, and answer their challenge!"

    Zheng Dugong "snapped" his fingers and said:
    "He does his, we do ours, I don't want trouble."

    A stoker named Sun Xiaobo immediately opposed him:
    "Old Sage, are you still thinking with your Manchukuo brain?"

    Zheng Dugong got angry as soon as he heard that:
    "Who is Manchukuo? Don't spew nonsense!"

    You said one thing, I said another, and the two started arguing.

    Stoker Hu Chun Dong pulled them apart. This young man hated arguing the most. He said:
    "Are we having a meeting or arguing? If you have energy to spare, go unload coal!"

    Although Shang Baoheng sometimes liked to scold and make noise, he looked down on this group of young people in his heart. When he saw them arguing, he lengthened his face and pouted, saying:
    "Forget it, whether you want to accept the challenge or not, I'm not holding this meeting!"

    With that, he stepped out of the circle of people.

    The old hero hurriedly took a step forward and grabbed him:
    "Big Driver Shang, you can't leave, you're the leader on the train, whether we can accept the challenge depends on you."

    Shang Baoheng stopped. Li Yong turned to everyone and said:
    "Let's talk slowly, don't be trivial!" He swept his eyes over everyone and continued: "I think we should accept the challenge. I've been working on the railway for more than thirty years, and Big Driver Shang has been for more than ten years. Although you are young, you have all been here for seven or eight years. They are implementing a responsibility system, so can't we?"

    As soon as Old Shang heard this, his unyielding energy came up. He slapped his thigh with his right hand and said:
    "No problem, if he can run a thousand, I won't run less than two or five hundred!"

    At this, Sun Xiaobo, Zhang Chuanzhong, Hu Chun Dong, and others all shouted happily:
    "Support, support, let's do it!"

    After speaking, everyone looked at Zheng Dugong.

    Zheng Dugong was clever and always had tricks up his sleeve, so everyone called him "Old Sage." This person liked to be lazy, play tricks, and just get through the day. He didn't admire anyone, except Old Shang for his skills, high education, and seniority. Mainly, it was because they had similar temperaments.

    Seeing that Old Shang suddenly took the lead in accepting the challenge, and seeing that everyone else was following suit, he said:
    "Everyone has two shoulders and a head, what the hell, let's do it!"

    Everyone was waiting for his words. As soon as he said it, people immediately elected Old Shang to write the letter of acceptance and send it away.

    六、吵吵嚷嚷应战
    商宝恒刚念完；一个说：
    “赛就赛，谁怕谁？”
    另一个说：
    “咱们有老英雄哩，保险赢他们的。”
    老英雄说：
    “那就开个会，大家合计合计，应人家的战！”
    郑笃恭两个手指“劈”的一声，开了腔：
    “他干他的，咱干咱的，我不找麻烦。”
    一个叫孙效伯的司炉马上反对他道：
    “老圣人，你整个满洲国思想？”
    郑笃恭一听就火了：
    “谁是满洲国？你别满嘴喷粪！”
    你一言我一语，两个人吵起来。
    司炉胡春东把他两个拉开。这青年最讨厌顶嘴吵架，他说：
    “咱是开会还是吵架？有劲没处使，卸煤去！”
    商宝恒虽说有时也爱骂骂闹闹，本心里并瞧不起这帮子年青人。一见他们吵就拉长脸子噘着嘴说道：
    “算球了，爱应战不应战，这会我不开了！”
    说着拔腿就走出人圈外。
    老英雄急忙抢上一步拉住他：
    “商大车，你不能走，你是车上的老大，能不能应战全靠你啦。”
    商宝恒这才停住。李永转脸又向大家说道：
    “咱们有话慢慢说，别鸡毛蒜皮的！”他把眼向大家扫了一圈，继续说：“我看还是应战。我干铁路三十多年，商大车也是十多年，你们虽说年轻，也都七八年了，人家实行负责制，咱就不能？”
    老商一听，那股不服人的劲头就上来了，右手往大腿上一拍，说道：
    “没问题，他能跑一千，我不少跑两五百！”
    这一来，孙效伯、张传忠、胡春东等都很高兴地嚷道：
    “拥护拥护，说干就干。”
    说完，大伙都瞅着郑笃恭。
    郑笃恭长的机灵，鼻子一吸溜就出鬼招儿，所以大家管他叫“老圣人”。这人爱偷个懒，耍个滑，混一天算一天。他不佩服别人，就服老商有技术，文化高，资格老。主要的，还是因为脾气有点相同。
    他见老商突然带头应战，又见大伙也都跟着干，就说道：
    “谁也是两个肩膀扛着个脑袋，扯鸡巴蛋，干就干！”
    大伙单等他这句话，他一说出来，人们就立刻推选老商写好应战书送走了。
