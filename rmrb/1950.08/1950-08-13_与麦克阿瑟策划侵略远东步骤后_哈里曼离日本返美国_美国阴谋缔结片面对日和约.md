Xinhua News Agency, August 11th:

　　After conducting three days of aggressive activities, Truman's special foreign policy advisor Harriman, who arrived in Tokyo on the 6th, left Japan on the 8th to return to the United States. While in Tokyo, Harriman held several long, secret talks with MacArthur. On the 7th, Harriman also went to South Korea to meet with Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, Muccio, the US ambassador to the Syngman Rhee puppet government, and the puppet Syngman Rhee. According to Harriman's statement at a press conference after returning to Washington on the 9th, he went to Japan and Korea at Truman's request to "discuss various political issues in the Far East and observe the development of events" with MacArthur. In Japan, he "discussed all the political situations in the Far East" with MacArthur, that is, he discussed the entire US policy of aggression against the Far East. According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 7th, the "new active political policy" of the United States towards Asia discussed by Harriman and MacArthur will be used to coordinate the "firm military stance" of US armed aggression.

　　One of the main purposes of Harriman's "visit" to Japan was to strengthen the support of Japanese militarist forces and to openly use the Japanese armed forces as assistants for US aggression in the Far East. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Washington on the 6th, citing "observers," former US General Staff officer Lowe and US Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Norstad were two generals "skilled in troop mobilization and strategic air operations." Their accompaniment of Harriman to Tokyo indicated that the United States wanted to "rebuild the Japanese army." A dispatch from the 4th had already revealed that Lowe was more qualified than anyone to study "to what extent the United States can rely on Japan in terms of military strength and labor."

　　Simultaneous with Harriman's trip to Tokyo, US imperialism is plotting to conclude a unilateral peace treaty with Japan by the imperialist bloc in order to openly use the Japanese army as its assistant in aggression. According to a United Press report, MacArthur said in a telegram to US Democratic Senator Magnuson on the 9th that "early consideration and completion of a peace treaty with Japan" should be given. At the same time, according to a United Press dispatch on the 3rd, senior officials in Washington also issued a clamor that the Korean War has made a separate peace with Japan "more urgent."

　　与麦克阿瑟策划侵略远东步骤后
    哈里曼离日本返美国
    美国阴谋缔结片面对日和约
    【新华社十一日讯】六日飞抵东京的杜鲁门外交政策特别顾问哈里曼，进行了三天的侵略活动后，已于八日离日返美。哈里曼在东京时曾与麦克阿瑟数度举行长时间的秘密会谈。七日，哈里曼并曾一度赴南朝鲜与美国第八军军长瓦克、美国驻李承晚傀儡政府大使缪锡俄及傀儡李承晚会谈。据哈里曼于九日返抵华盛顿后在招待记者会上声明，他是应杜鲁门的要求，前往日本和朝鲜，与麦克阿瑟“讨论远东各种政治问题并观察事件的发展”。他在日本曾与麦克阿瑟“讨论了远东各地的一切政治局势”，即是说，讨论了美国对远东的全部侵略政策。据合众社东京七日电透露，哈里曼与麦克阿瑟所讨论的美国对亚洲的“新的积极的政治性政策”将用以配合美国武装侵略的“坚决军事立场”。
    哈里曼“访”日的主要目的之一是加强扶植日本军国主义势力，想公开利用日本武装部队充任美国侵略远东的助手。据法新社华盛顿六日电引“观察家”谈话称：前美国参谋总部武官洛威与美国空军副参谋长诺斯塔德是两个“在兵员动员和战略空军作战方面有擅长”的将官。他们的伴同哈里曼前往东京，指明美国要“重建日本陆军”。该社四日电即已透露，洛威比任何人都合格来研究“美国在军事力量与劳工上可以依靠日本到什么程度”。
    与哈里曼东京之行同时，美帝国主义正在阴谋缔结帝国主义集团的片面对日和约，以便公开利用日军，充当其侵略的助手。据合众社讯，麦克阿瑟于九日在复美国民主党参议员麦克纳逊的电报中，认为应当“及早考虑并完成对日和约”。与此同时，据合众社三日电称：华盛顿高级官员亦发出朝鲜战争已使对日单独媾和“变得更加迫切”的叫嚣。
