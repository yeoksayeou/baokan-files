Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The Chinese People's Delegation, which went to Korea to participate in the "August 15th" Fifth Anniversary of the Liberation of Korea, returned to Beijing on the evening of the 24th.

Those who went to the station to welcome the delegation included Chen Shutong, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Zhang Bojun, Luo Longji, Shao Lizi, Zhang Hanfu, Wang Shao'ao, Liu Ningyi, Wu Han, Wang Bingnan, Yan Baohang, and other representatives from the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Central People's Government, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, totaling more than 200 people.

Li Zhouyuan, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Counselor Cui Ying, and embassy staff also went to the station to welcome the delegation.

A grand welcoming ceremony was held in front of the station. Staff from the Korean Embassy, and representatives from the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's Federation, the Youth Federation, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association's Beijing branch, presented flowers to all members of the delegation. Chen Shutong, Shen Junru, Luo Longji, Liu Ningyi, Wu Han, and others delivered speeches at the welcoming ceremony, warmly welcoming the delegation's return after successfully completing the task entrusted to them by the people of China.

Ambassador Li Zhouyuan of Korea then delivered a speech. Ambassador Li said: The visit of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea has given strong support to the Korean people and strengthened the Korean people's confidence in victory. The entire Korean people express their heartfelt gratitude to the representatives of the Chinese People's Delegation and the Chinese people.

Finally, Guo Moruo and Li Lisan, the head and deputy head of the Chinese People's Delegation, delivered speeches in reply. Head Guo Moruo first briefly reported that the delegation participated in the celebration of the "August 15th" Fifth Anniversary of the Liberation of Korea and expressed their condolences to the Korean military and civilians who are bravely fighting the war against America. Head Guo stressed that the delegation's trip had two major gains: (1) personally witnessing the heroic spirit of the Korean people in resisting American imperialist aggression, and (2) personally witnessing the barbaric and inhuman atrocities of the American imperialist aggressors in massacring the Korean people. He said: The 30 million Korean people have been fully mobilized to fight for the final victory of the liberation war. The bestial bombing by American imperialist planes has instead strengthened the unity and determination to win of the Korean people. The Korean People's Army will surely achieve final victory.

Deputy Head Li Lisan emphasized the steel-like will and high degree of organization of the Korean people's heroic struggle. He said: Under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the Korean people are doing their best to support the front lines and strive for final victory. He called on the Chinese people to learn from the heroic spirit of the Korean people's struggle, and under the leadership of Chairman Mao, to fight for the liberation of Taiwan and other territories of our country, and to support the Korean people.

　　参加朝鲜解放五周年庆典后
    我国人民代表团返京
    【新华社二十四日讯】前往朝鲜参加“八、一五”朝鲜解放五周年庆典的我国人民代表团已于二十四日晚返抵北京。
    前往车站欢迎者有中国人民政协全国委员会、中央人民政府、各民主党派、各人民团体代表陈叔通、沈钧儒、黄炎培、章伯钧、罗隆基、邵力子、章汉夫、王绍鏊、刘宁一、吴晗、王炳南、阎宝航等二百余人。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻我国大使李周渊、参赞崔英、及使馆人员亦到车站欢迎。
    欢迎者在车站前举行了盛大的欢迎会。朝鲜大使馆人员、及北京市工会、妇联、青联、中苏友好协会市分会代表，曾向代表团全体团员献花。陈叔通、沈钧儒、罗隆基、刘宁一、吴晗等在欢迎会上先后致词，对于代表团圆满地完成了全中国人民所交托的任务归来，一致表示热烈的欢迎。
    继由朝鲜大使李周渊致词。李大使说：这次中国人民代表团访问朝鲜，给予朝鲜人民有力的声援，更加强了朝鲜人民的胜利信心。全朝鲜人民对中国人民代表团诸代表及中国人民表示衷心的感激。
    最后由中国人民代表团正副团长郭沫若、李立三致答词。郭沫若团长首先简略报告代表团在朝鲜参加了庆祝“八、一五”朝鲜解放五周年、慰问了英勇地进行抗美战争的朝鲜军民。郭团长着重指出代表团此行的两大收获是：（一）亲眼看到朝鲜人民抵抗美帝侵略的英雄气概，（二）亲眼看到美帝侵略者屠杀朝鲜人民的野蛮的无人道的兽行。他说：朝鲜三千万人民已经全体动员起来，为争取解放战争的最后胜利而奋斗。美帝飞机的兽性滥炸，反而加强了朝鲜人民的团结和必胜的意志。朝鲜人民军一定能够获得最后胜利。
    李立三副团长强调说明朝鲜人民英勇斗争的钢铁意志和高度的组织性。他说：朝鲜人民在金日成将军的领导下正全力为支援前线、争取最后胜利而奋斗。他号召中国人民学习朝鲜人民英勇斗争的精神，在毛主席的领导下为解放台湾和我国其他领土而奋斗，并声援朝鲜人民。
