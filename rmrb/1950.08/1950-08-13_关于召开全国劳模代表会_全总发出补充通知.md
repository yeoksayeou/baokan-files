　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a "Supplementary Notice Regarding Preparations for the National Conference of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers" on the 11th. The supplementary notice specifically stipulates: (1) The Northeast, Northwest, East China, Central South, and Southwest Major Administrative Region Federations of Trade Unions (or the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Offices) should promptly determine the quota of representatives allocated to each province and city in their respective regions (the North China Region and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will follow existing regulations). Each province and city should immediately conduct the selection of model worker representatives in accordance with the allocated quota. (2) In order to conduct the selection more solemnly, and to truly ensure that representatives who are recognized and supported by the masses are elected, major cities should, as far as possible, convene municipal industrial model worker conferences to elect representatives to attend the National Model Worker Conference from the model workers attending the municipal model worker conferences (model workers attending municipal model worker conferences must also be elected by the masses). If a municipal model worker conference cannot be convened due to time constraints or other reasons, a city-wide employee representative conference must be convened to discuss and approve the representatives to attend the National Model Worker Conference who have been elected by the masses in various factories and enterprises. The selection of provincial industrial labor models can be the responsibility of the provincial trade union (or the provincial trade union special district office) committee, but it must be guaranteed that the selected model worker representatives are truly recognized and supported by the masses, and must be subject to democratic discussion by the workers and masses of the production unit that produces the model worker representatives. (3) The selection of model worker representatives must be combined with in-depth mobilization and publicity and education work. The selection work must achieve the purpose of educating employees and promoting work. When the representatives depart, symposiums and farewell parties can be held, and welcome parties can be held for representatives passing through, in order to encourage them.
