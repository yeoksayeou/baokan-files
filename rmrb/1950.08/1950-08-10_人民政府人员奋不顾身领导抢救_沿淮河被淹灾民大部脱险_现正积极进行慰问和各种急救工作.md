Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 9th: In the areas north of the Huai River in Anhui Province that were flooded, the majority of the disaster victims have now been evacuated thanks to the all-out rescue efforts of the People's Government. Farmers in areas where the floodwaters have receded are replanting late autumn crops. Of the 100,000 disaster victims trapped in the water in Huoqiu and Shouxian counties, 80,000 have been evacuated. In Funan (newly established county, south of Fuyang), the hardest-hit county in the Fuyang Special District, two-thirds of the 120,000 disaster victims have been rescued. In the Su County Special District, Lingbi County alone has rescued 80,000 disaster victims. During the rescue process, from Huang Yan, Director of the Anhui North People's Administrative Office, and Deputy Director Li Yunhe to the main cadres of the counties, districts, and townships, and the local troops in Anhui North, all braved the wind and rain and went into the floodwaters. Several working cadres sacrificed their lives while swimming to rescue disaster victims. This high degree of dedication to serving the people greatly moved the evacuated disaster victims.

Currently, the People's Governments at all levels are conducting condolence and emergency relief work for the evacuated disaster victims. Xu Kai, Director of the Planning Committee of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, and Li Yunhe, Deputy Director of the Anhui North Administrative Office, personally went to the Huaihe River disaster area to wade through the water and express their condolences to the disaster victims. County Chief Tang of Funan County mobilized the masses in non-disaster areas overnight to make 3,000 catties of stir-fried flour and 2,000 steamed buns, which were distributed to the evacuated disaster victims. In the Lu'an Special District, the Commissioner's Office and the Flood Control Headquarters, in addition to distributing 1.1 million catties of emergency relief grain, 80,000 catties of salt, 200,000 catties of rice straw, and thousands of mats to solve the food and shelter difficulties for the disaster victims, also mobilized the masses in the unaffected mountain areas to donate a bamboo pole per household to help the disaster victims build temporary shelters. Bengbu City has also set up disaster victim shelters to accommodate the evacuated disaster victims in the city and nearby villages. The Anhui North People's Administrative Office is also preparing to continue distributing 25 million catties of emergency relief grain and 15,000 old mats to help the disaster victims solve their food and shelter difficulties.

In areas where there is still hope of harvesting after the water recedes, governments at all levels are leading the people to rush to plant late autumn crops. As for disaster victims in severely affected areas who cannot replant late autumn crops, the People's Government is planning to evacuate them to other safe areas for long-term production and disaster relief. The Fuyang Special District has decided to resettle the disaster victims from Su County who were originally relocated to Huoqiu in Lu'an, Shucheng, Huoshan, Jinzhai and other counties. The People's Governments of Huoqiu and Shouxian counties have decided to issue resettlement grain to impoverished farmers who have been heavily affected and cannot return to their hometowns to engage in production for the time being, and evacuate them to other areas to organize production.

　　人民政府人员奋不顾身领导抢救
    沿淮河被淹灾民大部脱险
    现正积极进行慰问和各种急救工作
    【新华社上海九日电】皖北沿淮河被水淹地区的灾民，在人民政府全力抢救下，现已大部脱险。洪水已退地区的农民正在补种晚秋。霍邱、寿县困于水中的十万灾民，已有八万人脱险。阜阳专区水灾最重的阜南（新设县、阜阳南部）县，十二万灾民中，已有三分之二被抢救出来。宿县专区仅灵璧一县即已救出灾民八万人。在抢救过程中，从皖北人民行署主任黄岩、副主任李云鹤到县、区、乡主要干部与皖北地方部队都冒狂风暴雨出入洪水之中。有几个工作干部因为泅水抢救灾民，已牺牲自己的生命。这种高度为人民服务的精神使脱险的灾民很受感动。
    现在各地人民政府对于已经脱险的灾民，正在进行慰问和急救工作。中央人民政府水利部计划委员会须恺主任、皖北行署李云鹤副主任等均亲往浍河灾区涉水慰问灾民。阜南县唐县长曾连夜动员非灾区群众，赶做炒面三千斤、蒸馒头二千斤，分发给脱险的灾民。六安专区专署及防汛指挥部，除发放急救粮一百一十万斤，食盐八万斤，稻草二十万斤，席子数千条，为灾民解决食宿困难外；并发动未受灾的山区群众，每户捐献一根竹竿，帮助灾民搭棚居住。蚌埠市也设立了灾民收容所，收容市内及附近乡村的脱险灾民。皖北人民行署还准备继续发放急救粮二千五百万斤，旧席子一万五千条，帮助灾民解决食宿困难。
    在水退后补种尚有收获希望的地区，各级人民政府正领导人民抢种晚秋。至于重灾地区无法补种晚秋的灾民，人民政府正有计划地将其疏散到其他安全地区，作长期生产救灾的打算。阜阳专区已决定将原来移居霍邱的宿县灾民，分别安插到六安、舒城、霍山、金寨等县。霍邱、寿县人民政府对于受灾较重一时无法回乡生产的贫苦农民，决定发给安家粮，疏散到其他地区进行组织生产。
