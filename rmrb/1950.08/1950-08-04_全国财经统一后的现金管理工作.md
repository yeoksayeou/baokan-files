　　Cash Management Work After the National Financial and Economic Unification
    Yang Zhesheng
            (1) An Overview of Cash Management in the Past Three Months
    On March 3rd, the Government Administration Council issued the "Decision on Unified National Financial and Economic Work," which "designates the People's Bank of China as the central institution for national cash allocation." In accordance with this instruction, the People's Bank of China resolved at the National Financial Conference to first realize the central government's goal of "making the bank the center of cash." On April 7th, the Government Administration Council also issued the "Decision on Implementing Cash Management in State Organs." Subsequently, cash management work was actively carried out across the country. The earliest areas were Shanghai, Nanjing, and Jinan in East China, while other regions also implemented it successively.
    How was the cash management work carried out? In terms of steps, it was first loose and then tight, first large cities and then small cities, first enterprises and then institutions, first managing cash and then requiring income and expenditure plans. Its basic spirit was to carry out this work in a step-by-step and planned manner, avoiding biases. Specifically, it meant first depositing cash into the bank, and not being too strict about its cash payments at the beginning. Geographically, it started with large cities, the central government, major administrative regions, provinces, and directly administered cities, and then gradually extended to the special and county levels. In terms of departments, it started with state-owned enterprises with large cash income and expenditure, followed by major institutions. For the preparation of cash income and expenditure plans, a focused pilot was adopted. According to the Government Administration Council's order on cash management, it was first piloted in the major departments directly under the central government to gain experience, and then promoted to all regions and departments across the country. Generally, cash management work was gradually carried out according to the following procedures:
    First, make full preparations and conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization. First, within the bank, study the cash management documents. Bank cadres in various regions studied and discussed the Government Administration Council's cash management order and the Northeast's experience in cash management, in order to clearly understand the importance of cash management and correct incorrect views on cash management, so that the work could be carried out smoothly. Secondly, convene symposiums with financial officers and accountants from state-owned enterprises, institutions, troops, and organizations to explain the significance of cash management and solicit opinions, so that everyone can understand the intention of cash management. Some also held special meetings of accounting personnel to discuss the specific steps and procedures for implementation. For example, the Tianjin Branch initially focused on cash deposits and divided the managed accounts into five batches: the first batch was state-owned industrial and trade departments and municipal industrial departments, the second batch was municipal trade departments and municipal cooperatives, the third batch was all organs and production departments within the city, the fourth batch was municipal and higher-level organs, schools (public), organizations, and troops in Tianjin, and the fifth batch was foreign procurement agencies stationed in Tianjin, carrying out the work with focus and in a step-by-step manner. In terms of specific procedures: currently, the method of opening accounts centrally at the branch's business department is adopted, ending the old deposits in various bank offices in the past, and transferring them all to the branch's business department, but the managed units can still deposit and withdraw at the local bank offices (as internal collection and payment for the bank). Each managed unit, according to the determined managed order, fills out a three-day cash retention statistics form and an account opening application (the amount of cash retained for three days must be approved by the Municipal Finance Committee), goes to the bank to receive a transfer notice or special check, and retains a seal, and can deposit and withdraw funds at the bank. The special check must specify the account name, amount, purpose, cash withdrawal or transfer, and can be cashed at various bank offices, and the bank must not refuse. This method has been of great help in promoting cash management. At the same time, write articles in newspapers and publish news to carry out publicity. For example, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou not only wrote news reports, but also published reports from the responsible persons. In Chahar Province, the radio station was also used to broadcast cash management work, which received great results.
    Second, Party and government coordination to ensure and supervise the implementation of cash management. Asking the person in charge of the government (or finance committee) to report on the cash management work has a great impetus. For example, Li Yiqing, deputy director of the Central South Finance Committee in Hankou, spoke about cash management at a cadre meeting. Tan Zhenlin, chairman of Zhejiang Province, reported at a cadre meeting and announced that those who violate cash management will be punished according to financial discipline. Li Fanglin, secretary of the Xuanhua Municipal Party Committee in Chahar Province, said at the Party Committee meeting: "All levels of Party committees must ensure that all departments implement the system." A certain army political department stationed in Chahar Province proposed: "Unify thinking, ensure organization, and sanction discipline." and notified all levels of supply departments that they must resolutely implement it. These all played a great role in promoting and guaranteeing the work. Secondly, the local government (or finance committee) issues cash management orders in accordance with the Government Administration Council's order on cash management, and then according to the specific situation, which is a powerful weapon to ensure the implementation of cash management. Many provinces and cities have done this. Central-level departments, in order to make their subordinates resolutely implement it, have also issued instructions, such as the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Trade. Some have also established top-down enterprise treasuries for centralized cash management, such as the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Fuel Industry, the Telecommunications Bureau, and the Ministry of Trade. These are all conducive to the promotion of cash management.
    Third, improve institutions, simplify procedures, and change work style: establish cash management departments to specialize in planning, organizing, promoting, supervising, and inspecting work. For example, Shanghai, Tianjin, and major cities, the People's Bank of China first established a cash management department or cash management section, and other bank offices also established cash management sections or groups one after another according to the work situation to strengthen this work. Major city banks have also added offices and sub-offices. Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places have also added service stations or service offices to conduct work separately according to the managed units. In terms of simplifying procedures and changing work style: first, it must be clear that in order to do a good job in cash management, it is necessary to simplify procedures and strengthen the spirit of service. For example, in Xi'an, the handling of deposit and withdrawal procedures required six or seven steps and took 30 minutes before simplification, but after simplification, it took three or four steps and took 5 minutes, at most no more than 13 minutes. For example, Shanghai, Nanjing, Kaifeng, and other places implement a small cashier system, cashier counters, and the division of deposit collection, etc., and implement a cashier point-of-sale sealing system to shorten the procedure time and improve efficiency as much as possible. The Changsha People's Bank of Hunan Province extended its office hours to 9 p.m., and implemented a Sunday shift system to provide convenience to customers. The Tianjin Branch established an inquiry office to answer questions specifically to solve the problem of customers not understanding the procedures. Beijing and Shanghai went to institutions and state-owned enterprises to mobilize, explain, and persuade them many times to deposit cash into the bank. They were initially unwilling to deposit, but later they came very happily.
            (2) Achievements and Role of Cash Management Implementation
    Although cash management has only been implemented for three months, it has achieved remarkable results. In addition to absorbing a large amount of idle funds, which can be used to support production, it has also reversed the practice of relying on issuance to solve funds in the past. This is a major change in financial work. Specific achievements are manifested in the following aspects:
    First, deposits have increased significantly, especially public deposits: Since the implementation of cash management, the total deposits of the National Bank by the end of June have increased by 271.2% compared with the end of March, among which the Southwest region has increased the most, by 862.9%. The Northwest region increased by 815.8% compared with the end of March. The Central South region increased by 448.2% compared with the end of March. The East China region increased by 182.5% compared with the end of March. The North China region increased by 179.4% compared with the end of March. The seven major cities (Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Beijing, Tianjin) increased by 198.5% at the end of June compared with the end of March. Among them, deposits of public institutions increased by 280.2% compared with the end of March, with Hankou increasing the most by 758%, Chongqing increasing by 502.7%, Xi'an increasing by 407.7%, Beijing increasing by 389.2%, Tianjin increasing by 111%, Shanghai increasing by 234.8%, and Guangzhou increasing by 261.4%. In addition to the seven major cities, other cities increased by 414.5% at the end of June compared with the end of March. This shows that since the implementation of cash management, most of the cash of state-owned enterprises, institutions, troops, and organizations has been deposited into the National Bank, which is the result of cash management.
    Second, cash use has been greatly reduced, and transfers have been greatly increased: After the implementation of cash management and the promotion of the transfer system, the ratio of cash to transfers has changed greatly. For example, in Shanghai, the ratio of cash to transfers was 1:15.7 in February, 1:31 in April, and 1:48 in early May. In Nanjing, it was 1:1 in March and 1:11.5 in April. In Hankou, the ratio of cash to transfers in deposit income was 1:6.6 in April, and the ratio of cash to transfers in deposit payment was 1:9.3. On May 20, the ratio of cash to transfers in income deposits had reached 1:43, and the ratio of deposit payment was 1:9.3. In Tianjin, the ratio of cash to transfers was 1:13 at the end of April and 1:30 at the end of May, an increase of more than double. In Chongqing, it was 1:2.3 in March and 1:7.6 in April. In Lanzhou, it was 1:3.4 in March, 1:4.3 in April, and 1:9 in May. This shows that transfers are constantly increasing, and the use of cash has been greatly saved.
    Third, the number of managed units opening accounts has increased significantly since the implementation of cash management: For example, in Shanghai, before management, the original number of scattered accounts of state-owned enterprises was 1,379, which has now been merged into 633, while the number of institutions, organizations, and troops has increased from the original 1,543 to 1,804. Nanjing added 153 accounts after implementing cash management, Hankou had 376 accounts at the end of April and increased to 680 accounts on May 17, and the three cities of Anyang, Jiaozuo, and Xinxiang in Pingyuan Province had 312 units to be managed, and 281 accounts have now been opened, accounting for more than 90% of the units to be managed. Lanzhou added 154 accounts in May. Most of the units to be managed in other regions have also opened accounts.
    Fourth, the deposit reserve ratio has been greatly reduced: Cash management not only makes the source of deposits of the National Bank broader, but also extends the time of general deposits. Due to the above situation, coupled with the slowdown in the velocity of money circulation, the bank's deposit reserve ratio has been greatly reduced. The National Bank's total deposit reserve ratio was 24.3% of deposits in March, which dropped to 16.3% in May, and only accounted for 15.4% at the end of June. The situation of deposit reserves in various regions is also the same. For example, in East China, it accounted for 22.6% of deposits in March and dropped to 5.5% in June. The seven major cities accounted for 14.1% of deposits in March and only accounted for 7% in June. Shanghai accounted for 9.3% in March and only accounted for 2.4% in June. Beijing accounted for 14.3% in March and only accounted for 1.7% at the end of June. Other regions have also been greatly reduced. In this way, the bank can use a larger part of the deposits for production.
    Fifth, saving manpower and expenses, promoting enterprise management, and strengthening planning: Due to the increase in transfer and allocation, there is no need to move large amounts of cash around. In addition to the accounting department being busier due to transfers, the number of cashiers has been reduced a lot. For example, the Hebei Branch's business department used to have more than 120 cashier cadres, and now it can withdraw 49 people to transfer to study or other work departments. If the People's Banks in various regions reduce one-third of the cashier cadres according to this ratio, it will have a great effect on saving personnel and reducing expenses. In addition to the bank, other units have also saved a lot of cashier personnel. For example, the Qingdao Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Company saved 60 cashiers in eight units. If calculated at a monthly salary of 300,000 yuan per person, it can save 18 million yuan per month. In addition, due to cash management, the planning of banks and various departments has been strengthened, and the economic accounting of enterprises has been promoted. For example, the East China Industrial Department originally lacked 12 billion yuan in the April plan and needed to borrow money to solve it. After implementing cash management, not only did it not need to borrow money, but it deposited 13 billion yuan instead.
    In short, since the implementation of cash management, the deposits of the People's Bank of China have increased greatly, the use of cash has been greatly reduced, and the idle funds of various institutions, enterprises, organizations, and troops have gradually been able to be concentrated and used, thereby expanding the bank's ability to support production and promoting the stability of finance and prices. This has played a great role in the recovery and development of the national economy.
            (3) Several Issues That Should Be Paid Attention To In The Future
    First, simplify procedures, change work style, and strengthen the spirit of service. This is an important condition for doing a good job in cash management. Practical experience shows that cash management is better if we can work hard in these directions, otherwise it will be difficult. Although the bank offices in various regions have made great achievements in this regard, a strict inspection shows that it is still not enough. For example, in some places, it takes a long time to wait when depositing, withdrawing, or remitting money, and some attitudes are not amiable enough, and the work style is also very rigid. Technically, there are too many cash income and expenditure plan forms, and there are also many percentages in them. Some have not seriously implemented them step by step according to the specific situation, such as asking small units for income and expenditure plans. In the future, each bank should set up a mobile collection and delivery team to collect and deliver funds to the more distant and major collection and payment units is very necessary; business field personnel should appropriately divide the area, understand the situation, closely contact each customer, and help them establish relevant accounts and transfer procedures; convenience should be given in deposit and remittance procedures, it is necessary to establish an inquiry office, and customers who do not understand the place should be explained clearly, so that they feel helped and convenient.
    Second, urge departments to improve the accounting system: Practical experience proves that for departments that do not have a sound accounting system, cash management is not only difficult to carry out, but also unfavorable to the management of their business operations and institutional expenditure. Because the accounts are not clearly recorded, the inventory is messy, it is impossible to determine the three-day inventory, and it is even more impossible to prepare an income and expenditure plan. The bank cannot check its inventory and income and expenditure, which of course hinders the implementation of cash management. At present, the accounting books and procedures of many departments are very chaotic, the current accounts do not match, some have not been recorded for a long time, and some are very messy even if they are recorded, and even IOUs are used as inventory, which should be paid attention to by various departments and should be solved as soon as possible.
    Third, eliminate blank accounts and generally stipulate inventory limits: The so-called elimination of blank accounts is to make all managed accounts, as stipulated in the Government Administration Council's cash management order, open accounts in the bank. In carrying out this work, we should adopt persuasion, mobilization, and explanation according to the order to urge them to open accounts in the bank. Important departments must be grasped tightly. In stipulating the three-day inventory limit, there is not more experience now. We should adopt self-reporting, agreement, and consultation to determine the inventory limit, and report it to the local finance committee for verification and approval after repeated inspection and correction, and eliminate the phenomenon that the managed accounts are willing to keep more cash at home.
    Fourth, continue to implement the cash income and expenditure plan on a key trial basis: At present, although some places have tried to compile it, they all feel that it is difficult, the financial income and expenditure plan is not accurate enough, there are too many plan forms, and there is not enough experience. Therefore, the number of plan forms can be appropriately reduced, such as ten-day reports, five-day reports, and daily reports, which can be tried out on the basis of a sound accounting system and its own actual income and expenditure situation. At the beginning, do not require it too strictly, and gradually make it accurate. On the existing basis, the bank should also focus on trying to compile a cashier plan to promote the planning of currency management and currency circulation.
    Fifth, strengthen the promotion of transfer and allocation to reduce cash use: At present, in various places, especially at the lower levels, the use of transfer and allocation and transfer checks is not clear, which hinders the smooth implementation of cash management. Therefore, we should vigorously publicize the benefits of transfer and allocation, and explain that this is also beneficial to them. And formulate specific procedures for transfer and allocation, and the method of using transfer checks, so that they can understand the importance of the work in their minds, so that the bank can gradually achieve the goal of being a clearing and credit center.

　　全国财经统一后的现金管理工作
    杨哲省
            （一）三个月来的现金管理概况
    三月三日政务院颁布了统一国家财经工作的决定。“指定人民银行为国家现金调度的总机构。”人民银行依照这个指示在全国金融会议上决议，首先实现中央“使银行成为现金中心”。四月七日政务院又颁发了“关于实行国家机关现金管理的决定”。接着，全国各地就积极进行现金管理工作，各区以华东之上海、南京、济南为最早，其他各地区亦先后陆续实行。
    现金管理工作是怎样进行的呢？在步骤上是先松后紧，先大城市后小城市，先企业，后机关，先管理现金，后要收支计划。它的基本精神，就是使得这一工作有步骤有计划的进行，避免发生偏向。具体的说：就是先使现金存入银行，对其现金支付开始不要管的太严。在地区上，先管大城市，中央、大行政区、省与省直属市一级，以后逐渐推广到专、县一级。在部门上先从拥有大量现金收支的公营企业着手，继之为主要机关。对于现金收支计划的编制，采取有重点的试编，根据政务院颁布现金管理的命令，先在中央直属的主要部门试办，取得经验，再推行到全国各地各部门去。一般现金管理工作，主要的是依照如下的程序逐步展开的：
    第一、充分的准备，广泛而深入的宣传动员。首先是在银行内部，进行现金管理文件的学习：各地银行干部，均根据政务院现金管理命令与东北现管经验文件材料，进行学习研讨，以便明确认识现金管理的重要性，并纠正对于现金管理的不正确看法，使工作能顺利进行。其次召开各公营企业、机关、部队、团体的财务负责人与会计人员座谈会，说明现金管理的意义，征求意见，使大家了解现金管理的用意。有的还专门召开了会计人员会议，商谈进行的具体步骤与手续。例如天津分行，开始以现金存行为主，并将被管户分成五批进行，第一批为国营工业、贸易部门与市营工业部门，第二批为市营贸易部门及市级合作社，第三批为本市市内外之一切机关生产部门，第四批为在津市级以上机关、学校（公立）、团体、部队，第五批为外来驻津采购机关，有重点有步骤的进行。在具体手续上：目前采取集中分行营业部开户的办法，结束过去在各行处旧有存款，并均结转到分行营业部来，但各被管单位仍可在就地之行处存取（为银行内部代收付）。各被管单位，按确定的被管次序，填写三日应留现金统计表及开户申请书（三日留存现金数额，须经市财委批准），到银行领取转账通知书或专用支票，及留存印鉴，即可在银行存取款项。专用支票，须载明户名、金额、用途、取现或转账，可在各行处取存，银行不得拒绝。这种方法对推行现金管理上，确有很大的帮助。同时在报纸上写文章，发布消息进行宣传。例如上海、天津、汉口不仅写消息报导，还将负责人报告登载。在察省还利用广播电台，广播现金管理工作，收到很大的效果。
    第二、党政配合，保证与督促现金管理工作的进行。请政府（或财委）负责人报告现管工作，是有很大的推动作用的。如汉口中南财委副主任李一清在干部大会上讲现金管理工作。浙江省谭震林主席在干部大会报告，并宣布凡违犯现金管理者要按财政纪律制裁。察省宣化市委书记李芳林同志在党委会上谈“此一工作各级党委要保证各部门按制度执行”。驻在察省某军政治部提出：“打通思想，组织保证，纪律制裁。”通知各级供给部门，必须坚决执行。这都起了极大的推动与保证作用。其次，当地政府（或财委）依据政务院关于现金管理的命令，再根据具体情况颁发现金管理命令，是保证现金管理执行的有力武器。不少省市都这样做了。中央一级部门，为使其下级坚决执行，也分别发出了指示，如重工业部，贸易部。有的为现金集中管理，还建立了自上而下的企业金库，如铁道部，燃料工业部，电信局，贸易部。这都是对推行现管有利的。
    第三、健全机构、简化手续，改变作风：增设现金管理部门，专门从事计划、组织与推动督促检查工作。如上海、天津及主要城市，人民银行首先建立了现金管理部或现金管理科，其他行处亦均按工作情况先后增设现金管理科或股，加强这一工作。主要城市行也有增设办事处、分理处的。上海、南京等地并增设服务站或服务处，按被管各单位分别进行。在简化手续与转变作风方面：首先必须明了要想搞好现金管理工作，必须简化手续，加强服务精神。如西安市办理存取手续在简化前须经过六、七道，费时三十分钟，简化后为三、四道手续，费时五分钟，最多不过十三分钟。如上海、南京、开封等地实行小出纳制，出纳专柜及划分存款代收等，并实行出纳点款封包制，尽量使手续时间缩短，提高效率。湖南省长沙人民银行办公时间延长至夜九时，实行星期日轮班照常收付制，使顾客感到方便。天津分行为解决顾客不明手续的问题，设立问事处，专门进行解答工作。北京、上海为使现金存入银行曾三番五次到机关、公营企业去动员解释说服，他们开始不愿存，后来便很乐意的来了。
            （二）现金管理实施后的收获与作用
    实行现金管理虽然只有三个月，已收到了显著成效。除吸收大批闲散资金，可以用于扶植生产外，还扭转了历年来靠发行来解决资金的办法。这是财政金融工作中的一大转变。具体成绩表现在下列几方面：
    第一、存款大量增加，尤其是公营：现管以来，国家银行总存款截止六月底，比三月底增加百分之二七一·二，其中西南区增加最多，为百分之八六二·九。西北区比三月底增加百分之八一五·八。中南区比三月底增加百分之四四八·二。华东区比三月底增加百分之一八二·五。华北区比三月底增加百分之一七九·四。七大城市（上海、汉口、广州、重庆、西安、北京、天津）六月底比三月底增加百分之一九八·五。其中公营机关存款比三月底增加百分之二八○·二，汉口增加最多为百分之七五八，重庆增加百分之五○二·七，西安增加百分之四○七·七，北京增加百分之三八九·二，天津增加百分之一一一，上海增加百分之二三四·八，广州增加百分之二六一·四。除七大城市外其他城市截止六月底，比三月底增加百分之四一四·五。说明现管后，公营企业、机关、部队、团体的现金，大部均已存入国家银行，这都是现管的成效。
    第二、现金使用大大减少，转账大量增加：实行现金管理，推行转账制度后，现金对转账比例已起了很大变化。例如：上海二月现金与转账比例为一比一五·七，四月份为一比三一，五月上旬达一比四八。南京三月份为一比一，四月份成为一比一一·五。汉口四月份存款收入中现金与转账比例为一比六·六，存款付出为一比九·三，五月二十日收入存款中现金与转账的比例已达一比四三，付出存款为一比九·三。天津四月底现金对转账比例为一比一三，五月底为一比三○，转账增加一倍多。重庆三月份为一比二·三，四月份成为一比七·六。兰州三月份为一比三·四，四月份为一比四·三，五月份已达一比九。这都说明转账在不断增加，现金的使用已大为节省。
    第三、现管以来，被管单位开户显著增加：例如，上海未管前公营企业分散户原为一三七九户，现合并为六三三户，而机关、团体、部队从原有一五四三户增到一八○四户。南京实行现金管理后增加一五三户，汉口四月底为三七六户，五月十七日增至六八○户，平原省的安阳、焦作、新乡三市应管单位三一二户，现已开二八一户，占应管单位百分之九○以上，兰州五月份就增加一五四户。其他各地区应管单位亦多已开户。
    第四、提存准备额大为减低：现金管理不仅使国家银行的存款来源更为广阔，且一般存款的时间亦较延长。由于以上情况，再加上货币流通速度的减缓，银行的存款提存准备额也就大大减少。国家银行总的提存准备额，三月份占存款百分之二四·三，五月份降为百分之一六·三，六月底只占百分之一五·四。各地提存准备款情况，也是如此，例如：华东区三月份占存款百分之二二·六，六月份降到百分之五·五。七大城市三月份占存款百分之一四·一，六月只占百分之七，上海三月份占百分之九·三，六月份只占百分之二·四，北京三月份占百分之一四·三，六月底只占百分之一·七。其他各地亦大为减少，这样，银行就可以将存款中更大部分，用到生产事业上去了。
    第五、节省人力、经费，促进企业经营，加强了计划性：由于转账划拨的增加，便无须再将大批现金搬来搬去，除了会计上因转账较忙外，出纳人员节省了不少，如河北分行营业部过去有一百二十多名出纳干部，现能抽出四十九名转入学习或其他工作部门。假使各地人民银行都按照这个比例减少三分之一的出纳干部，在节省人员与减少开支两方面，都有很大作用。除银行外，其他单位也节省了不少出纳人员，如青岛市花纱布公司八个单位，即省去了出纳六十人，若按每人月薪三十万计，则每月便可节省一千八百万元。此外由于现金管理，也加强了银行以及各部门的计划性，并促进了企业部门的经济核算。如华东工业部，在四月份计划中原缺头寸一百二十亿，需要借款解决，实行现金管理后，不但不要借款，反而存款一三○亿。
    总之，自实行现金管理以来，人民银行的存款已大增，现金的使用已大为减少，各机关、企业、团体、部队闲散的资金，已逐渐能做到集中运用，从而扩大了银行扶植生产事业的能力，也促进了金融物价的稳定。这对于国民经济的恢复与发展，已起了很大作用。
            （三）今后应该注意的几个问题
    第一、简化手续，改变作风，加强服务精神。这是搞好现金管理工作的重要条件，实际证明，能够朝着这些方向努力的，现金管理就进行得比较好，反之就困难。各地行处在这方面，虽然有很大成绩，但是严格的检查一下，还是不够的。例如有的地方，在存取款或汇划时，等的时间很长，有的态度还不够和蔼，作风也很生硬，在技术上现金收支计划的表格太多，其中百分比也很多，还有的并未认真按具体情况有步骤的执行，如向小的单位要收支计划。今后各行亟应办理流动取送款组，到较远的，与主要的较大的收付单位取送款项是很必要的；业务外勤人员，应适当划分地区，了解情况，密切各户联系，并帮助其建立有关账簿与转账手续；存、汇手续上应给以方便，设立问事处是需要的，顾客不懂地方应给讲清楚，使他们感到有所帮助与便利。
    第二、督促各部门健全会计制度：实际经验证明，凡是没有健全会计制度的部门，现金管理的进行不仅很困难，且对其企业经营，机关经费开支的管理等尤为不利。因为账簿记不清楚，库存杂乱，既无法确定三日库存数，更不可能编收支计划，银行也无法检查其库存与收支情况，当然就妨碍了现金管理的进行。目前不少部门会计账簿及手续很紊乱，往来账不符，有的很长时间未记账，有的虽记亦很乱，甚至还有以白条充当库存，这应引起各部门注意，并应尽速设法解决。
    第三、消灭空白户，普遍规定库存限额：所谓消灭空白户，就是按政务院现管命令规定之各被管户，全部做到在银行开户，在进行这一工作上，应根据命令并采取说服动员解释，促其来银行开户。尤其是重要部门必须抓紧。在规定三日库存限额上，现在还没有更多经验，应采用自报协议商定库存限额，经多次检查修正，报由当地财委核定，消灭被管户愿在家多保存现金的现象。
    第四、继续贯彻重点的试编现金收支计划：目前各地虽有试编的，但均感有困难，财务收支计划不够准确，计划表格太多，经验也还不够。因此，在计划表格上可适当减少，如旬报、五日报、日报，可在会计制度健全与其本身收支实际情况的基础上来试编，开始不要要求太严，逐步使其精确。在现有基础上，银行也应有重点地试编出纳计划，促进货币管理与货币流通的计划化。
    第五、加强推行转账划拨，减少现金使用：在目前各地尤其下层部门，对转账划拨与转账支票使用不清楚，因而有碍于现金管理工作的顺利推行，故应大力宣传转账划拨的好处，并说明这对他们也是有利的。并拟定转账划拨具体手续，转账支票使用方法，使他们在思想上明了该工作的重要，以便使银行逐渐达到清算信贷中心的目的。
