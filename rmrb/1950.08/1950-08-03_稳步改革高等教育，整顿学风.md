Steadily Reform Higher Education, Rectify the Style of Study

The decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the leadership relations of institutions of higher education, and the decision of the Ministry of Education of the Central Government, submitted to the Government Administration Council for approval and promulgation, on the implementation of curriculum reform in institutions of higher education, as well as three other documents, are major events in the construction of higher education in our country. These documents are of great significance for reforming the old higher education, developing the new democratic education, and rectifying our style of study. Based on the cultural and educational policies stipulated in Chapter 5 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the actual needs of national construction, and taking into account the specific conditions of higher education institutions in various regions, these documents determine the direction and tasks of higher education, and establish the principles of leadership relations and curriculum reform in higher education institutions, which will be implemented nationwide. From now on, higher education workers across the country will have a clear direction and goal for their joint efforts and can move forward steadily and practically.

Since liberation, due to the requirements of the objective situation and the efforts of higher education workers, many institutions of higher education have carried out preliminary reforms in teaching content and teaching methods and have achieved certain results, but they still cannot meet the urgent needs of national construction. Of course, the content of education belongs to the category of ideology, and the reform of education has its own complexity and long-term nature, and cannot be accomplished overnight. However, there is no doubt that the status quo should be changed and reforms should be gradually carried out.

Chairman Mao clearly instructed us in his historic report "Strive for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation": "Carry out the reform of the old school education and the old social and cultural undertakings step by step and prudently, and strive to make all patriotic intellectuals serve the people. On this issue, the idea of delaying and being unwilling to reform is wrong, and the idea of being too impatient and attempting to carry out reforms with crude methods is also wrong." Therefore, items that are qualified to implement a certain degree of reform should be appropriately reformed; those that do not have the conditions should actively create conditions.

Under the current conditions, what possible reforms should we carry out in higher education? As the "Decision on the Implementation of Curriculum Reform in Institutions of Higher Education" points out: "The purpose of higher education institutions in the People's Republic of China is to cultivate advanced construction talents with a high level of culture, mastery of modern science and technology achievements, and wholehearted service to the people, based on the provisions of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on cultural and educational policies, and with an educational method that combines theory and practice." And "In the past year, the educational content of higher education institutions across the country has undergone preliminary reforms, and certain results have also been achieved, but a considerable part of the curriculum in existing higher education institutions is not yet new democratic, that is, it is not national, scientific, and mass-oriented, and cannot meet the needs of the new China's construction. Therefore, the curriculum of higher education institutions across the country must be reformed in a planned and step-by-step manner in accordance with Article 46 of the Common Program to achieve the unity of theory and practice. On the one hand, we must overcome the empty dogmatic tendency of 'academic for academic's sake' and strive to combine with the actual needs of national construction, which is the main direction of our existing higher education institutions; on the other hand, we must prevent the narrow pragmatism or empiricism that neglects theoretical learning."

How to implement the guidelines and principles stipulated in these documents into the actual work of higher education institutions in various regions? How to implement them into the academic system, curriculum, teaching materials, teaching methods, etc.? This is a very complex issue. Solving this problem requires practical and specific plans and extremely cautious steps. This requires the correct leadership and assistance of government education departments and other relevant departments, as well as the unity and arduous efforts of all higher education workers. Only when we strive to implement such reforms can we establish a correct style of study that combines theory and practice; can we use correct viewpoints and methods to study science, philosophy, literature, and art, encourage scientific inventions and literary and artistic creations that meet practical needs, and strive to popularize scientific and technological knowledge, and learn and spread literary and artistic achievements to the broad masses of the people. This is a very glorious task, and it is also a very arduous task. The reason why this task is arduous is mainly because the vast majority (85 percent) of the 227 public and private higher education institutions in the country have grown out of the educational traditions of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. Their basic shortcoming is the generally recognized inconsistency between learning and application, and the separation of theory and practice. This is where we must strive to reform. The so-called rectification of the style of study mainly means rectifying this phenomenon of separation between theory and practice.

Article 4 of the "Decision on the Implementation of Curriculum Reform in Institutions of Higher Education" stipulates: "Institutions of higher education should take the department as the teaching unit for cultivating specialized talents, and the curriculum of each department should closely cooperate with the current and long-term needs of national economic, political, defense, and cultural construction. On the basis of systematic theoretical knowledge, appropriate specialization should be implemented; courses that are necessary and important should be set up and strengthened with emphasis according to the principle of streamlining, and those repetitive and unnecessary courses and contents should be deleted, and efforts should be made to connect and link various disciplines. When deleting repetitive and unnecessary courses and contents, it must be done after careful consideration and multi-faceted discussion, and it must not be done rashly. The courses offered by each school should be in accordance with the actual needs of national construction, and courses should not be set up because of individuals." These are all fully in line with the above-mentioned reform guidelines. The reason why we want to adopt such a method for the reform of the old school education is because only in this way can we unite all possible educators on a broad basis, work together, and achieve the goal of truly effectively reforming, developing, and improving our school education to meet the needs of our revolutionary construction.

Our country is a new democratic country. Politically, it is an alliance of four revolutionary classes based on the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class; economically, it represents the combination of five economic components under the leadership of the state-owned economy. Our cultural and educational work should be a reflection of this politics and economy. In our ideological circles, under the leadership of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, which represent the advanced elements of the working class, there are also the thoughts of other democratic classes and strata existing and active. For various different ideological viewpoints, our principle should be: all those that conform to the Common Program should be allowed; the differences and contradictions between them should be debated freely to ensure the continuous progress of the ideological circles; but ideological viewpoints that violate the Common Program should be corrected and overcome. There is unity and struggle here, and the purpose of the struggle is for unity. Only in this way can it meet the requirement of "striving to make all patriotic intellectuals serve the people."

All educators should unite on the ideological viewpoint of the Common Program, strive for progress, and work hard to reform school education and rectify the style of study. Higher education workers should set an example for educators across the country in this reform work. We should recognize that the old higher education should continue to be reformed because it does not yet meet the requirements of the Common Program, and therefore does not yet conform to the highest interests of the Chinese people at this stage. The idea of delaying and being unwilling to reform is wrong because this idea violates the requirements of the Common Program and hinders the development and improvement of people's education. People's education can only continuously absorb fresh nutrients and continuously develop and improve in the process of close integration with reality. The idea of being too impatient and attempting to carry out reforms with crude methods is also wrong because this idea either exceeds the historical conditions of our country's revolution, exceeds the scope stipulated by the Common Program, or ignores the actual situation of our country's education and does not estimate the complexity of educational reform and the inadequacy of subjective forces. Educational reform is a mass movement. Only when it is carried out on the basis of the conscious awareness of the broad masses of educators can it truly become a mass movement and achieve its due effect. Any thoughts and styles of work that violate this principle are wrong.

In order to make the reform of higher education better, more effectively rectify the style of study, and make school education more effectively serve national construction, unified leadership is necessary. Article 1 of the "Decision on the Leadership Relations of Institutions of Higher Education" stipulates: "The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government is responsible for the leadership of all institutions of higher education in the country (except military schools), and the education departments or cultural and educational departments of the people's governments or military and political committees of the major administrative regions are responsible for leading the institutions of higher education in their regions in accordance with the unified policies and guidelines of the Central Government." This is completely in line with the current situation and needs of higher education in our country. With such unified leadership, the plans and steps for the reform of higher education can be closely coordinated and acted upon consistently in all aspects as much as possible; and the wisdom and talents of higher education workers can be more fully brought into play, experiences can be exchanged and summarized in a timely manner, and the quality of teaching can be improved. We believe that, according to the spirit of the decisions issued by the Government Administration Council and the Ministry of Education of the Central Government, as long as all our higher education workers work together with one heart and one mind, and implement them in a planned and step-by-step manner, we will surely be able to gradually complete the glorious and arduous task of reforming higher education and rectifying the style of study.

### 稳步改革高等教育，整顿学风

　　稳步改革高等教育，整顿学风
    中央人民政府政务院所发布的关于高等学校领导关系的决定，中央教育部提请政务院批准发布的关于实施高等学校课程改革的决定及其他三个文件，这是我国高等教育建设上的一件大事。这些文件对于改革旧的高等教育，发展新民主主义的教育，整顿我们的学风具有重要的意义。这些文件根据人民政协共同纲领第五章所规定的文教政策和国家建设的实际需要，并照顾各地高等学校的具体情况，确定了高等教育的方针和任务，确定了高等学校领导关系、课程改革等项原则，将在全国范围内加以实施。从此全国高等教育工作者有了共同努力的明确方向和目标，可以脚踏实地稳步前进了。
    解放以来，由于客观形势的要求和高等教育工作者的努力，不少高等学校在教学内容和教学方法上进行了初步的改革，取得了一定的成绩，但仍不能满足国家建设的迫切需要。固然，教育的内容是属于思想意识的范畴，教育的改革有其一定的复杂性和长期性，不可能一蹴而成。但应该改变现状，逐步进行改革，这是没有疑问的。
    毛主席在《为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争》的历史性报告中明确指示我们：“有步骤地谨慎地进行旧有学校教育事业和旧有社会文化事业的改革工作，争取一切爱国的知识分子为人民服务。在这个问题上，拖延时间不愿改革的思想是不对的，过于性急、企图用粗暴方法进行改革的思想也是不对的。”因此，凡有条件可以实行某种程度改革的事项，就应该加以适当的改革；条件不够的，就应该积极创造条件。
    在目前条件下，我们在高等教育方面，应该进行那些可能的改革呢？这正如《关于实施高等学校课程改革的决定》所指出的：“中华人民共和国高等学校的宗旨，为根据中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领关于文化教育政策的规定，以理论与实际一致的教育方法，培养具有高度文化水平、掌握现代科学与技术的成就并全心全意为人民服务的高级建设人材。”而“一年来，全国高等学校的教育内容，已经经过了初步的改革，也收到了一定的成效，但现有高等学校课程中相当大的部分还不是新民主主义的，即还不是民族的、科学的、大众的，还不能符合新中国建设的需要。因此全国高等学校的课程，必须根据共同纲领第四十六条的规定，实行有计划有步骤的改革，达到理论与实际的一致。一面克服“为学术而学术”的空洞的教条主义的偏向，力求与国家建设的实际相结合，这是我们现有高等学校主要的努力方向；另一面要防止忽视理论学习的狭隘实用主义或经验主义的偏向。”
    如何把这些文件所规定的方针和原则贯彻到各地高等学校的实际工作中去？如何贯彻到学制、课程、教材、教学方法等等方面去？这是一个非常复杂的问题。解决这个问题，要有切合实际的具体计划和极审慎的步骤。这就需要政府教育部门和其他有关部门的正确领导和协助，需要全体高等教育工作者的团结和艰苦的努力，只有当着我们努力实行了这样的改革，我们才能够树立理论与实际一致的正确的学风；才能够运用正确的观点和方法，研究科学、哲学、文学和艺术，鼓励切合实际需要的科学发明和文学艺术的创作，并努力普及科学和技术的知识，向广大人民群众学习和传播文学和艺术的成果。这是十分光荣的任务，也是十分艰巨的任务。这个任务之所以艰巨，主要是因为在全国现有的二百二十七个公私立高等学校中，绝大多数（百分之八十五）都是从半封建半殖民地的旧中国的教育传统中生长起来的。它们的基本缺点便是大家公认的学与用不一致，理论与实际脱节。这就是我们要努力改革之所在。所谓整顿学风，主要的也就是整顿这种理论与实际脱节的现象。
    《关于实施高等学校课程改革的决定》第四项规定：“高等学校应以学系为培养专门人才的教学单位，各系课程应密切配合国家经济、政治、国防、和文化建设当前与长期的需要，在系统的理论知识的基础上，实行适当的专门化；应根据精简的原则，有重点地设置和加强必需的和重要的课程，删除那些重复的和不必需的课程和内容，并力求各种学科的相互联系和衔接。在删除重复和不必需的课程和内容时，必须经过深思熟虑和多方面的讨论，决不可轻率从事。各校开设课程应按照国家建设的实际需要，不应因人设课。”这些都是完全符合上述的改革方针的。我们对于旧有的学校教育的改革所以要采取这样的办法，因为只有这样，才能在广大的基础上团结一切可能团结的教育工作者，共同努力，达到真正有效地改革、发展和提高我们的学校教育，以适应我国革命建设的需要。
    我们的国家是新民主主义的国家，从政治上说，它是在工人阶级领导下，以工农联盟为基础的四个革命阶级的联盟；从经济上说，它代表在国营经济领导下的五种经济成份的结合。我们的文化教育工作应当是这种政治和经济的反映。我们的思想界，在代表工人阶级先进分子的马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想的领导之下，还有其他民主阶级阶层的思想存在着，活动着。对于各种不同的思想观点，我们的原则应当是：凡是合乎共同纲领的，都应该被容许；它们中间的差别和矛盾，应该实行自由的论辩，以保障思想界的不断前进；但是违背共同纲领的思想观点，就应该加以纠正和克服。这里有团结，也有斗争，而斗争的目的又是为了团结。这样才合于“争取一切爱国的知识分子为人民服务”的要求。
    一切教育工作者都应该在共同纲领的思想观点上团结起来，力求进步，努力改革学校教育，整顿学风。高等教育工作者更应该在这个改革工作中做全国教育工作者的表率。应该认识旧有的高等教育所以应该继续加以改革，就因为他还不适合共同纲领的要求，因而也还不符合现阶段中国人民的最高利益。拖延时间不愿改革的思想之所以是不对的，就因为这种思想违背共同纲领的要求，阻碍人民教育的发展和提高。人民教育只有在与实际密切结合的过程中才能不断吸收新鲜的养分，不断的发展与提高。过于性急，企图用粗暴方法进行改革的思想之所以也是不对的，就因为这种思想或者是超过了我国革命的历史条件，超过了共同纲领所规定的范围，或者是忽略了我国教育事业的现实状况，没有估计到教育改革的复杂性和主观力量的不足。教育改革工作是一个群众性的运动。只有在广大教育工作者自觉的基础上进行，才能真正成为群众性的运动，才能取得应有的效果。任何违背这一原则的思想作风都是不对的。
    为了使高等教育的改革工作做得更好，更有效地整顿学风，使学校教育更有效地为国家建设服务，统一的领导是必要的。《关于高等学校领导关系的决定》第一项规定：“中央人民政府教育部对全国高等学校（军事学校除外）均负有领导的责任，各大行政区人民政府或军政委员会教育部或文教部均有根据中央统一的方针政策，领导本区高等学校的责任。”这完全符合于目前我国高等教育的情况和需要。有了这样统一的领导，才能使高等教育改革的计划与步骤，尽量获得各方面的密切配合和一致行动；也才能够更充分地发挥高等教育工作者的聪明才智，及时地交流与总结经验，提高教学的质量。我们相信，根据政务院和中央教育部发布的决定的精神，只要我们全体高等教育工作者同心协力，有计划有步骤地去执行，一定能够逐步完成改革高等教育，整顿学风这个光荣而艰巨的任务。
