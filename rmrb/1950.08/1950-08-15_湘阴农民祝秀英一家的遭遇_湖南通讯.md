	Farmers are not destined to be poor,
	Only blame the landlord's cruel exploitation.

	One
　　Zhu Xiuying, an old woman in her fifties from Shuangsuiwan, Xiangyin County, repeatedly requested to participate in the land reform activist training class in the county. Comrades in the district said to her, "Your hair is almost white, and you're so old. It's a hundred and twenty *li* by water to the county seat. Are you sure you can make the trip?" Zhu Xiuying said, "I may be old, but my heart is not. I know all about the fields; I know the hardships of the peasants. As long as you don't mind me being old, I can handle things." Neighbors asked Zhu Xiuying why she was so happy to hear about the Land Law. She said, "My husband and I worked hard for thirty years to reclaim wasteland twice for the landlords, but we still didn't have enough to eat or wear all year round. When my husband was dying, he was still worried: After decades of hard work, he didn't leave any fields for his children, only a pile of debt. Now that the People's Government has established the Land Law, and we're about to get land, my husband can close his eyes in peace even though he's dead. If I'm not happy, who else would be?"
　　Looking at Zhu Xiuying's family and their thirty years of bloody and tearful life under cruel exploitation will make you understand even more why the peasants so enthusiastically support the Land Reform Law.
　　Two
　　Zhu Xiuying's husband was named Xu Decai, and his ancestral home was in Lanxi Township, Yiyang County. Hearing that life was easier near the lake (Dongting Lake), he scraped together some capital and came to Xianzhou, Xiangyin County, with his two elder brothers.
　　In 1919, they rented twenty *mu* of land from the landlord of Liuhewang. Upon entering the village, they first had to pay "deposit money" (a type of supra-economic exploitation) of three *shi* per *mu*. The rent was one *shi* and five *dou* per *mu*. The following year, floods submerged the rice crop, but the landlord still pressed for rent. Having no other choice, they borrowed twenty *shi* of grain at high interest rates to pay the rent. But with interest of four *dou* per *shi*, compounded annually, Decai was in debt year after year. By the fourth year, he owed more than sixty *shi* of grain. Unable to continue farming, they gave up the tenancy and left the village. The entire year's harvest wasn't enough to repay the debt, and the landlord confiscated the sixty *shi* of deposit grain, using an oversized measuring *dou*. Unable to wait to starve to death, the three brothers had no choice but to seek livelihoods separately.
　　Landlords Cao Shengtang, Cao Yiying, and others were recruiting tenants in Shuangsuiwan to reclaim wasteland (a newly silted sandbar). Xu Decai and other farmers who had lost money farming and could not afford to pay "heavy deposits" to farm cultivated land came to Shuangsuiwan. Reclaiming wasteland didn't completely免掉avoid "deposit money" either. Decai wrote that he would reclaim fifty *mu* of wasteland, specifying a deposit of four *dou* of grain per *mu*, but in reality, he could only reclaim twenty *mu*, so the deposit was actually one *shi* of grain per *mu*. Knowing they were being taken advantage of, they still had to grit their teeth and do it, because the landlords' rules were the same in every village.
　　They built a thatched hut and settled down. Decai and Xiuying put all their energy into the wasteland.
　　The uneven wasteland was covered with reeds and thatch taller than a person in the high areas, and firmly rooted *qingfan* grass clumps in the low-lying areas. The sharp edges of the reeds would cause redness and swelling wherever they pricked. Decai worked hard all day, and at night, he would feel the stings on his arms and chest, and without even washing the mud off his legs, he would fall asleep. Before the third crow of the rooster, he would be back in the fields in the dark. And Xiuying? Although pregnant, she carried her child on her back and cut firewood and dug grass with her husband. Sometimes, Xiuying was so tired that her head spun, and her legs ached so much she couldn't lift them, but she still mustered her strength to continue digging grass. When she couldn't bear it anymore, she painfully placed her son, who was not yet two years old, on the cut reeds. The child rolled around, his body covered with red and purple welts from the reeds. Xiuying told others, "Which mother doesn't love her children, but it's all to turn the wasteland into cultivated land quickly!" The sun was scorching, and the ground was damp, so the child became ill. He had a high fever, and his limbs contracted. Without money to hire a doctor, they watched helplessly as their young son died. When the land was finally cultivated and planted with rice seedlings, Xiuying also fell ill from exhaustion and lay in bed for more than a month.
　　The newly reclaimed land yielded little. The following year, a flood breached the village dike, and there was no harvest. With two consecutive lean years, Decai lost another forty or fifty silver dollars in debt. Fortunately, the wasteland had become fertile land. The couple calculated that if they had two good harvest years, they could pay off their debts and their lives would be easier.
　　But the landlord's greed shattered Decai and his wife's hopes. Landlord Cao Shengtang told the tenants, "The village land is fertile, and the harvest is abundant. The deposit money will be increased by two *shi* per *mu*. If anyone can't pay, don't even think about farming my land." Xiuying tearfully discussed with her husband, "This is our blood and sweat, digging out the grass one by one and filling in the soil piece by piece! We've finally made it to the good times. No matter how difficult, we can't give it up." Decai loved this piece of land even more than Xiuying, but he calculated that he already owed forty or fifty yuan, and adding forty *shi* of deposit grain would require borrowing another one hundred and forty yuan. With compounded interest, farming would only be working for others for free. It would be better to withdraw the deposit, use the money to pay off the debts, and reclaim wasteland again. He advised Xiuying, "Farmers can't be afraid of hardship. Reclaiming wasteland is even harder, but the deposit is cheaper. Let's endure another year!"
　　As a result of their debate, they painfully abandoned the fertile land they had cultivated with three years of blood and sweat and went to Huafengwan to reclaim wasteland for the second time.
　　Three
　　The experiences in Huafengwan were even more bitter than in Shuangsuiwan.
　　They started reclaiming wasteland in the winter of 1924. The following year, there was a drought. The high-lying fields yielded no grain, and the low-lying fields yielded only one or two *dou* of grain per *mu*. However, the Dike Affairs Bureau (the landlord's agency) sent soldiers with guns to force the rent payment of five *dou* per *mu*, not a single grain less. What to do? Decai borrowed one hundred yuan from the landlord Wang Sipangzi (the head of the Dike Affairs Bureau) at a high interest rate to pay the rent to him. In May 1926, a flood submerged the seedlings again. The harvest was hopeless, and Decai panicked. He asked the landlord to terminate the tenancy and sought another way out. Seeing that Decai still had some value to squeeze, Wang Sipangzi had his mother-in-law, Granny Peng Si, pretend to be kind and said to Decai, "Keep farming the land. One year of drought, one year of flood, and you'll make it back in a good year. If you need money, I'll lend it to you." Decai borrowed another one hundred and twenty yuan from her at four percent interest.
　　The year of bumper harvest finally arrived. In 1927, the twenty-six *mu* of "unrefined land" (actually cultivated twenty *mu*) that Decai farmed yielded more than seventy *shi* of grain. But what Decai received was an even more serious bankruptcy and sorrow. Wang Sipangzi came to Decai to settle the accounts. The one hundred yuan borrowed in 1924, at four percent interest, amounted to one hundred and ninety-six yuan in principal and interest after two years. The one hundred and twenty yuan borrowed in 1925 amounted to one hundred and sixty-eight yuan in principal and interest, totaling three hundred and sixty-four yuan. Converting this to grain at four yuan per *shi*, the total was ninety-one *shi*. In addition, there were more than thirty *shi* of rent grain. The landlord aggressively confiscated all of Decai's grain, deducted all the tens of *shi* of deposit grain, and even took the waterwheel and furniture. The wooden planks, doors, and windows of the house were also torn down.
　　What remained were six mouths to feed – Decai and his wife, two sons, and two daughters. Watching the landlord take away dozens of *shi* of grain, watching his pitifully thin children, Xiuying cried incessantly, and Decai only sighed repeatedly. The young son, not understanding, cried to his mother for food. Decai was extremely saddened and complained to Xiuying, "It's all because you bore so many children. What are you going to feed them!" Xiuying was distraught and hit the child.
　　Decai told Xiuying to take the children to beg for food. Xiuying was a strong-willed person. She said, "I can endure hardship and farm the land. I'd rather die from farming than let my children suffer that." But without a waterwheel or an ox, and unable to pay the deposit, where could they go to farm?
　　Four
　　Xiuying and Decai returned to Shuangsuiwan with their children, relying solely on the four hands of the husband and wife to support the family. During the busy farming season, Decai worked by the month for others, helping with odd jobs. After the autumn harvest, when farming was slack and the lake water had receded, he went to the firewood mountain (undeveloped wasteland) to cut firewood. Xiuying picked wild vegetables at home to feed the pigs and also learned to grind tofu. Even so, they could not escape the oppression of the landlords. The tyrannical landlord insisted that the firewood mountain belonged to him and forcibly took three or four tenths of the hard-won firewood.
　　Life became even more difficult. The couple steeled their hearts and gave their thirteen-year-old eldest daughter to a farming family in Nanningwan with slightly better living conditions to be a child bride. Before getting into the sedan chair, the daughter clung to her mother's leg and cried, refusing to leave, "I'm so young. You're sending me to suffer in someone else's house. Mom, your heart is so cruel!" Xiuying tried to persuade her daughter, "Mom also can't bear to leave you, but there's no way to support you. I'm finding you a place to live and eat!" As she spoke, she began to cry. The eldest daughter left, weeping and sobbing. Decai and Xiuying felt like knives were twisting in their hearts, unable to find peace. Xiuying hugged and kissed her thin second daughter, saying sadly, "Daughter! Daughter! Whether you eat vegetables or grass, as long as your parents are not dead, let the second daughter spend a few more years with Mom."
　　Five
　　Landlord Guo Yunshan had seventeen *mu* of high-lying land that had become barren due to years of drought, overgrown with wild grass several feet deep. Guo Yunshan said to Xu Decai, "Farm this land. I'll let you pay less deposit." Xu Decai, who had been away from the land for ten years, rekindled new hope. He sold a pair of pigs for more than ten *shi* of grain and borrowed another eight or nine *shi* of grain from relatives and friends to rent this "drought wasteland."
　　After three or four years of hard work, the "drought wasteland" gradually turned into fertile land again. Unexpectedly, there was another severe drought in 1945. Even the riverbed cracked open with cracks several inches wide, and most of the rice crop died from the drought. Each *mu* of land yielded less than two *dou* of grain. The landlord insisted on demanding rent of seven *dou* and two *sheng*. His pleas were ineffective, and he wrote a rent arrears agreement to the landlord, with four percent monthly interest, to be paid off the following year. How could he repay the debt the following year? The couple frowned all day long. The children opened their mouths asking for food, and they had to brace themselves and keep working. They couldn't find odd jobs in the village, so they went to the firewood mountain to cut firewood. "Worry, hunger, and fatigue" tormented the strong man, leaving him skin and bones. After the Lunar New Year, Decai fell ill in bed, with pain all over his bones and in his stomach. The doctor said, "This is due to overwork and requires good nutrition." "Heavens, we can't even eat our fill of wild vegetables. What nutrition can we get?" Xiuying wept secretly. The unfortunate day finally arrived. On March 29, 1946, Decai knew that he had no hope of recovery. He called Xiuying and the children to his side. He told Xiuying not to be too sad, to take care of herself and the children. He said sadly to the children, "I worked hard all my life and didn't buy a single *mu* of land for you children, but left you a pile of debt. After I die, you must listen to your mother. Don't be like me, strive to make something of yourselves. When we can buy our own land, there will be a way out." That same night, Decai passed away.
　　Landlord Guo Yunshan, seeing that Decai had passed away, forced Xiuying to terminate the tenancy, "Your husband is dead, and you're unable to farm the land. I'll take back my land to avoid it becoming wasteland. You should find another way!" Xiuying pleaded bitterly, but Guo Yunshan didn't even blink and turned away. Later, thanks to the help and intercession of the neighbors, she managed not to terminate the tenancy immediately.
　　By the end of June 1949, Guo Yunshan finally terminated the tenancy of Xiuying and her children under a pretext. This is how it happened: One night, Guo Yunshan asked Xu Runsheng (Xiuying's eldest son) to carry mud to repair the dike. Runsheng had a stomachache and didn't go that night. The next day, Guo Yunshan sent people to beat Runsheng. Runsheng, in a moment of desperation, cursed, "Guo Yunshan! You have no conscience. You're too bullying!" Guo Yunshan was enraged and not only terminated the tenancy but also dug up the beans that Xiuying had planted and tore down the thatched hut where Xiuying lived. When Xiuying and her children tried to build a thatched hut on the dike to settle down, Guo Yunshan said, "No, we still need to raise the dike this year!"
　　Runsheng did odd jobs for the neighbors, and Xiuying led her young children, with nowhere to settle down. Just when they were at their wits' end, the Liberation Army brought light to the working people. Xiangyin was liberated. The Xianzhou District People's Government was established, and a Comrade Yuan came to Shuangsuiwan. Xiuying saw the light for the first time and poured out her grievances of many years. Comrade Yuan ordered Guo Yunshan to rebuild the thatched hut. Xiuying straightened her chest for the first time and returned to her own house. Guo Yunshan was unwilling and still wanted to make things difficult for Xiuying and her children. He built a fence in front of the thatched hut, blocking the way out. He didn't know that it was no longer the landlords' world. Xiuying tore down the fence, and the district cadre gave Guo Yunshan a lecture.

　　湘阴农民祝秀英一家的遭遇
　　——湖南通讯
　　力文·方堤
    农民不是命里穷
    只怪地主剥削凶
        ——湖南农谣
    一
    湘阴县双穗垸五十多岁的老婆婆祝秀英，听说县里开土改积极分子训练班，她再三要求参加。区里同志对她说：“头发都快白了，这么大岁数，到县城一百二十里水路，怕去不得？”祝秀英说：“我人老心不老，田里的事，我都知道；农民的苦处，我晓得；只要不嫌我老，我能办事情。”邻舍们问祝秀英为什么听说土地法就这样高兴？她说：“我和老板（丈夫）两个人，三十年来勤勤苦苦替地主开垦过二次荒洲，自己却一年到头不够吃，没得穿。老板临死时还惦记着：劳苦几十年，没给儿女置下一分田，只留下一堆债。现在人民政府立了土地法，眼看要分到田啦，老板死了，也安心的闭上眼睛了。我不高兴，谁还高兴呢！”
    看一看祝秀英一家，三十年来遭受残酷剥削的血泪生活，就会使你更懂得，农民们为什么这样热烈的拥护土地改革法。
    二
    祝秀英的丈夫叫徐德才，老家是益阳县兰溪乡人。听说滨湖（洞庭湖）地方生活好混，便凑集些本钱，和两个哥哥来到湘阴县锡安洲。
    一九一九年租六和垸地主二十亩田，进垸子先交每亩三石的“押金”（一种超经济剥削），租额是每亩一石五斗。第二年渍水淹了稻禾，地主却照样催租。没得办法，便借了二十石谷的高利贷，催租算挡过了。可是每石谷四斗利息，利上长利，使德才年年有债。到第四个年头，便亏空了六十多石谷。地种不起了，退佃出庄，全年收成不够还债，六十石押金谷，被地主扣掉大斗。不能等着饿死，三弟兄只好分头谋生。
    地主曹生唐、曹义英等人在双穗垸招佃开荒（一块新淤起的荒洲），徐德才便和其他种田亏本、无力出“重押”种熟田的农民，来到双穗垸。开荒洲也不能完全免掉“押金”，德才写了五十亩的荒土，言明每亩押金四斗谷，实际上能开的荒土只有二十亩，每亩出到一石谷的押金。明知吃亏也得咬着牙干，因为地主们兴的鬼规矩，各垸子都是一样。
    搭个茅棚安了家。德才、秀英两口子的心劲都用在荒洲上了。
    高低不平的荒洲，高地长满人多深的芦苇茅柴，低洼处是根深坚实的青樊草圪塔。芦苇锋芒锐利，刺到那里便要红肿了。德才成天劳苦，到夜里摸一摸刺伤的手臂和胸膛，两腿泥巴也不洗，倒头便睡，不到鸡叫三遍，便又搭黑下地了。秀英呢？虽然怀孕，还背着孩子和丈夫一起砍柴挖草。有时，秀英累得头发昏，腿酸得抬不起来，但她还是振作精神继续挖草。实在支持不住了，便忍痛把不到两岁的小儿子，放在砍倒的芦苇上。孩子滚来滚去，满身被芦苇刺得青一块紫一块。秀英对别人说：“那个当妈的不疼儿女，只为赶快把荒土变成熟田啊！”太阳晒，地里又潮湿，孩子照养不好病了，混身烧得烫人，手脚缩筋。没钱请医生，眼看着小儿子死掉了。到开成田，插上稻秧的时候，秀英也累病了，躺了一个多月。
    刚开出的荒田收获少，第二年大水又漫了垸堤，颗粒未收。连着两个歉年，德才又亏了四五十块银洋的债。好在荒洲已成肥田。夫妻俩盘算着，赶上两个丰收年，便还清账，日子就可以宽松些了。
    但地主的贪婪，打破了德才夫妇的希望。地主曹生唐对佃户们说：“垸田肥了，收获多了，每亩增添押金两石，谁拿不出，莫想种我的田。”秀英含着眼泪和丈夫商量：“这是将草一棵棵的挖掉，一块土一块土填平的血汗田啊！刚熬到好时候，再为难也不能丢开它不种。”德才比秀英更爱这块田；但盘算到：已亏空了四五十元，再添押金谷四十石，还要再借债一百数十元，利上加利，种田也是给别人白出力，不如退出押金，滕些钱还账，再去开荒。他劝秀英：“种田人不能怕吃苦，开荒洲更苦些，可是押金便宜，再苦一年吧！”
    争论的结果，还是忍痛舍掉用三年血汗养成的良田，到华丰垸二次开新荒。
    三
    在华丰垸的遭遇比双穗垸更苦。
    一九二四年冬天开荒，第二年遭旱，高田没有割谷，低田每亩收谷一、二斗，堤务局（地主的代理机关）却派枪兵逼租，每亩五斗，少一粒不行。怎么办呢？德才借地主王四胖子（堤务局大头目）一百元的高利贷，再交租给他。一九二六年五月，大水又淹了青苗，收成已经没有指望，德才心慌了，请求地主退佃，想另找生路。王四胖子看德才还有油水可榨，便让亲家婆彭四婆婆假装亲热的对德才讲：“田还是种下去吧，旱一年，淹一年，一个好年景，就捞回来了。缺钱用，我借给你。”德才又以四分利息借了她一百二十元。
    丰收年果真盼到了，一九二七年，德才种的二十六亩“毛田”（实耕二十亩）收了七十多石谷；但德才得到的却是一次更严重的破产与伤悲。王四胖子找德才算账，一九二四年借了一百元，四分利息，二年的本利是一百九十六元，一九二五年借一百二十元，本利一百六十八元，共三百六十四元。按四元一石折谷，共计九十一石，另外还有三十多石租谷。地主气势汹汹的没收了德才的全部粮食，又扣光了十数石押金，连水车、家具也拿走了，房子的木板、门窗也被拆光了。
    留下的只是需要吃饭的六张嘴——德才夫妇、两子两女。眼看着几十石谷被地主拿走，眼看着一群瘦得可怜的儿女，急得秀英直哭，德才只是一声连一声的叹气。不懂事的小儿子喊着妈要饭吃，德才难过极了，抱怨秀英：“都是你养了这样多儿女，你拿什么给他们吃！”秀英心乱了，便打孩子。
    德才让秀英领着孩子去要饭。秀英是刚性人，她说：“我吃得苦，种得田，宁愿种田累死，也不让孩子受那个罪。”但是，一没水车二没牛，交不起押金，赤手空拳，到那里去种田呢？
  四
    秀英、德才带着儿女重回双穗垸，只有靠夫妻俩四只手来维持一家生活。农忙时德才给人家做月工，帮零工，秋后农闲，湖水也退了，便去柴山（未开发的荒洲）砍柴。秀英在家拾野菜喂猪，还学会了磨豆腐。这样，依然不能摆脱地主们的压榨，强横的地主硬说柴山是他的，辛辛苦苦打来的柴，硬要抽三四成给他。
    生活是更加困苦了。夫妻俩心一横，把十三岁的大女儿，送给南宁垸一家生活稍好的农家去当童养媳。临上轿子，女儿抱着妈的腿哭着不肯走：“我这样小，送我到别家去受罪，妈妈心好狠啊！”秀英劝女儿说：“妈也舍不得离开你，没办法养活你，替你找个安身吃饭的地方！”说着说着也哭起来。大女哭哭啼啼的走了，德才、秀英心里像刀子搅，安静不下。秀英抱吻着瘦弱的二女，伤心的说：“女啊！女啊！不论吃菜吃草，只要爹妈没死，也叫二女跟妈多过几年。”
  五
    地主郭云山有十七亩高田，连年遭旱，成了荒土，满生着几尺深的野草。郭云山向徐德才说：“你种这块田吧，我让你少出些押金。”离开土地十年之久的徐德才，又燃起新的希望。一对猪卖了十多石谷，又求亲告友的借谷八、九石，租种了这块“旱荒”。
    三、四年的辛勤耕耘，“旱荒”又渐渐养成良田了。没想到一九四五年又一次大旱，连河底也裂开几寸宽的干纹，稻禾大半旱死，每亩田收不到二斗谷。地主硬要按七斗二升索租，哀求无效，向地主立下欠租约，四分行息，来年还清。来年又怎么还账呢？夫妻俩整天愁眉不展，孩子们张着嘴要吃，又不能不撑着腰干，垸子里找不到零工做，便去柴山砍柴。“愁、饿、累”，把一条强大汉子，折磨得皮包骨头。挨过旧历年，德才便病倒床上了，浑身骨头痛，肚子痛。医生说：“这是劳累过度，非很好营养不可。”“天哪，连野菜还吃不饱，用什么营养呢？”秀英暗地里流泪。不幸的一天终于到了，一九四六年三月二十九日，德才晓得自己已无指望好起来，把秀英和孩子们叫到跟前，他嘱咐秀英不要太伤心，要保重自己和好好照顾儿女。又对孩子们悲痛地说：“我劳苦一世，没给儿女买下一分田，倒留下一堆债。我死后，你们要好好听妈的话。不要和我一样，要争口气。什么时候，自家买到田，就会有办法了。”就在这天晚上，德才去世了。
    地主郭云山见德才去世，便逼着秀英退佃：“你老板死了，无力种田了，我的田收回来，免得荒了，你另打主意吧！”秀英苦苦哀求，郭云山眼皮不眨，扭头走开了。后来，多亏邻舍们的帮忙说情，总算没立刻退佃。
    到一九四九年六月底，郭云山终于借故退了秀英母子的佃。事情是这样发生的：有天夜里，郭云山让徐润生（秀英的大儿子）去挑泥巴修堤，润生正肚子疼，当晚没去。第二天郭云山派人来吊打润生。润生一时情急，骂了一声：“郭云山！你真黑良心，太欺负人！”郭云山发了火，不仅退了佃，连秀英种的菜豆也掘坏了，还拆了秀英住的茅房。秀英母子想在堤上搭个茅棚安身，郭云山说：“不行，今年还得加高修堤！”
    润生替邻舍去做零工，秀英领着小儿女，无处安身。正在这走头无路的时候，解放军替劳苦人民带来了光明，湘阴解放了。锡安洲成立了区人民政府，一个姓袁的工作同志来到双穗垸。秀英第一次见到光明，尽情地倾诉了多年来的冤曲。袁同志叫郭云山把茅房搭好，秀英第一次挺起了胸膛，回到了自己屋里。郭云山不甘心，还想给秀英母子为难，迎着茅屋修了一道篱笆，堵住出路。他不晓得，已不是地主的天下了。秀英拆散了篱笆，区干部把郭云山教训了一顿。
