　　Introduction to the International Union of Students

　　The International Union of Students (IUS) was established at the First World Student Congress in August 1946. It unites progressive student youth from around the world, and by last year, it had 3.5 million members in sixty countries. The IUS is a fraternal organization of the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY), and its headquarters are currently located in Prague. Its organizational structure is: Congress – Council – Executive Committee. The current Chairman of the Executive Committee is Czech representative Grohman, the Vice-Chairman is Soviet representative Shelepin, and the Chinese representative is Liang Geng, and the American representative is Hull.

　　The IUS extensively unites the youth of various countries oppressed by imperialism. In 1948, it jointly convened the Southeast Asia Democratic Youth Conference in Calcutta, India, and the Latin America Democratic Youth Conference in Mexico with the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The IUS particularly emphasizes the struggle of colonial students for national independence. The Colonial Students Department under the IUS headquarters has carried out extensive activities. In the first year after the establishment of the IUS, the department sent delegations to investigate the living and struggle conditions of colonial students, established close ties with various colonial student groups, and raised a large number of relief supplies, books, and medicines to send to colonial students struggling in hardship. On International Students' Day, November 17, 1948, the IUS held a colonial student movement exhibition, introducing the living and struggle conditions of students in colonial countries. Since 1949, student youth from various countries, under the call of the IUS and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, have held the "Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System" (March 21) and the "Day of Support for the Struggle of Spanish Democratic Youth." These struggles have been closely linked to the struggle for world peace.

　　The IUS participated in the World Peace Congress in April 1949. This April, the IUS's call for the collection of signatures for the Stockholm Appeal of the World Peace Council, and its call in July to oppose American aggression against Korea and support the Korean people, have been warmly responded to and supported by students around the world. In the struggle, the IUS has become a great force in defending world peace.

　　The Second Congress of the IUS is scheduled to open in Prague on August 14 this year. The main agenda of this meeting is: 1. Discussing work; 2. Re-electing the IUS Council. During the conference, there will be exhibitions, sports competitions, get-togethers, academic lectures, music and dance competitions and other activities.

　　国际学生联合会介绍
    国际学生联合会是在一九四六年八月世界学生第一次代表大会上成立的。它团结了全世界的进步学生青年，到去年为止，已在六十个国家内拥有三百五十万会员。国际学联是世界民主青年联盟的兄弟团体，会址现设布拉格。其组织机构为：代表大会——理事会——执行委员会。现任执委会主席是捷克代表格罗曼，副主席是苏联的谢利平，中国的梁畊和美国的胡尔。
    国际学联广泛团结了受帝国主义压迫的各国青年。在一九四八年，它曾和世界民主青联联合在印度加尔各答召开了东南亚民主青年大会，在墨西哥召开了拉丁美洲民主青年大会。国际学联特别重视殖民地学生争取民族独立的斗争。国际学联总部所属的殖民地学生部曾进行了广泛的活动。在国际学联成立后的第一年内，该部便派代表团调查了殖民地学生的生活及斗争的情况，与各殖民地学生团体建立了紧密的联系，并且募集了大量的救济品、书籍及医药送给艰苦斗争中的殖民地学生。在一九四八年十一月十七日国际学生日，国际学联举行了殖民地学生运动展览会，介绍了殖民地国家学生的生活和斗争情况。自一九四九年起，各国的学生青年在国际学联和世界民主青联的号召下，举行了“反对殖民制度斗争日”（三月二十一日）和“支援西班牙民主青年斗争日”。这些斗争已经和争取世界和平的斗争紧密联系起来。
    国际学联在一九四九年四月参加了世界拥护和平大会。今年四月，国际学联为征集和大常设委员会斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名发出的号召，和七月间为反对美国侵略朝鲜、支援朝鲜人民发出的号召，都获得了全世界学生的热烈响应和支持。在斗争中，国际学联已成为保卫世界和平的一支伟大的力量。
    国际学联的第二届代表大会定于今年八月十四日在布拉格开幕。这次会议的主要议程是：一、讨论工作；二、改选国际学联理事会。大会期间将举行展览会、体育竞赛、联欢会、学术讲座、音乐歌舞比赛等活动。
