　　The Korean People's Army fights bravely
    British and American reporters have to praise them
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] Reuters, London, August 14th: British and American reporters are gradually having to praise the fighting qualities of the Korean People's Army. For example, Price, one of the British military reporters, wrote in today's "Daily Mail": "In the mountains of South Korea, the enemy (referring to the Korean People's Army) has proven to be a master of strategic art. Moreover, in these remote valleys, many residents are always dissatisfied with the South Korean government. They provide intelligence to the invaders (referring to the People's Army) and join their troops as guerrillas. Therefore, new enemy troops are emerging in places unsuspected by the US military. The occupation of Pohang was prepared by such a sudden mobilization of the enemy's irregular forces. The enemy demonstrates its superiority in this kind of surprise attack. He chooses the location of his own attacks and strikes with all the advantages of a surprise attack."
    At the same time, the massive and barbaric slaughter of innocent people in Korea by American bombers is now causing increasing horror among civilized people around the world. Today's "Times" pointed out that as the Korean War brings more and more news of bombing cities and burning villages every day, anti-American anger is growing in the Indian public. Similar anger is also growing in Britain. Even Crossman, a reliable friend of the United States and a staunch anti-communist Labor MP, had to write in yesterday's "Sunday Graphic": "If we are to convince the Korean people and other people in Asia that Western civilization is superior to communism, then the indiscriminate bombing by the American army in Korea is indeed extremely foolish."

　　朝鲜人民军英勇善战
    英美记者也不得不赞扬
    【新华社讯】电通社伦敦十四日电：英美记者渐渐地不得不赞扬朝鲜人民军的战斗素质。例如英国军事记者之一普莱斯，今日在《每日邮报》写道：“在南朝鲜的山地中，敌人（指朝鲜人民军）已证明了他是战略艺术的大师。而且，在这些偏僻的山谷中，许多居民总是不满于南朝鲜政府。他们以情报供给入侵者（指人民军），并参加他们的部队充当游击队。因此，敌人新的部队就在不被美军怀疑的地方产生了。浦项的占领，就是敌人非正规军这样突然动员所准备好的。敌人表现他的优越性的地方就是这种突然打击。他选择他自己的打击的地点，并以突然袭击的一切优点打击之。”
    同时，美国轰炸机在朝鲜的大量野蛮屠杀无辜人民，现正在世界的文明人民间引起越来越大的惊骇。今日的《泰晤士报》即指出，当朝鲜战争每天带来更多的关于轰炸城市及焚烧村庄的消息时，印度公众反美的愤怒正在增长中。同样的愤怒也在英国增长中。甚至美国可靠的朋友及顽固的反共的工党议员克罗斯曼也不得不在昨天的《星期日画报》上写道：“如果我们要使朝鲜人及亚洲其他地区人民相信西方文明是优于共产主义的话，那么美军在朝鲜的滥肆轰炸，就确实是愚蠢之极了。”
