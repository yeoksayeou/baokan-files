　　A Preliminary Discussion of the Military Thought in "The Great Turning Point"
    Ding Li
    "The Great Turning Point" (note)—this military art film with the Battle of Stalingrad as its background, has given us, especially comrades working in the army, a very deep impression, mainly in terms of military thought.

    After watching the film, I came to the following understanding: Resolutely defending Stalingrad was not just to achieve the goal of urban defense; it was only an important step in the entire battle. More importantly, it was to use defensive means to strive for the maturity of appropriate timing and favorable conditions, and according to the planned plan, to give the enemy an unavoidable complete encirclement and annihilation. I think the basic strategic intention shown in "The Great Turning Point" lies in this; therefore, resolutely defending the city is of great strategic significance, that is, to force the enemy to invest greater or even all of its forces into the offensive, put them in a pocket, and annihilate them in one fell swoop.

    In the film, Front Commander General Muravyov appears to us as a typical Stalinist commander. Before he was appointed to command the front, the front was commanded very badly, almost in a situation of repeated defeats and extreme seriousness, mainly because General Vinogradov (an old general, later retained as deputy), lacked strategic vision, could not implement the strategic intentions of the General Headquarters, and did not have a high degree of strategic thinking. He mechanically and simply carried out "defense," resulting in repeated retreats and a crisis (Lieutenant General Krivenko's witty remark to Muravyov that "under Vinogradov's defense, the enemy could advance to the Urals" was very pertinent); he even formulated an extremely dangerous plan to evacuate the city. Based on his empiricism, he wanted to withdraw the troops to the other side of the Volga River, hoping to use the natural barrier to conduct a new defense. Muravyov corrected him and stopped the retreat, saying, "We must resolutely block the enemy, not only block the enemy, but also defeat the enemy with active offensives, so that they cannot recover." This decision was extremely important. Due to this measure, he turned the passive defense into an active defense—weakening the enemy's strength with mobile and decisive attack actions, exhausting the enemy's offensive, which gradually created favorable conditions; turning the passive situation into striving for initiative; overcoming the idea of retreat, restoring the confidence of victory, and the situation began to change.

    Lieutenant General Krivenko also lacked foresight and could not see the overall situation; he was satisfied with pursuing the minor victories belonging to his subordinates; he was dissatisfied with Vinogradov's defense and advocated attacking the enemy. Although the spirit of actively seeking battle was good, in essence, he was a desperate adventurer. He did not proceed from the overall interests. When Muravyov ordered him to attack the enemy's flank, he was dissatisfied with "fighting for others again."

    Muravyov, according to the intentions of the General Headquarters, was correcting this left or right thinking.

    Vinogradov and Krivenko also had a common characteristic of lacking confidence, which was both the cause and the effect of the military situation's failure. Vinogradov was enthusiastic about opening a second battlefield, naively believing that withdrawing from the city would lead to the appearance of a second battlefield to save the crisis. Muravyov corrected him, telling him: "The second battlefield is determined by us!" This made him sober up.

    When the city was in crisis, for military needs, Muravyov decided to appoint Krivenko as the city defense commander, but he refused; immediately, he was dismissed from his post, and Engineer Lieutenant General Panteleev took over his work. This demonstrated the Bolshevik's principled spirit and the army's high degree of discipline. Although they were old comrades and had deep feelings, the interests of the people were not allowed to be confused with friendship in the slightest. Afterwards, when the front military commission member expressed concern to Muravyov that this would affect others' trust in Krivenko, Muravyov replied: "If he himself doesn't trust himself, it's better for others not to trust him!" This spirit of seriously and meticulously fighting against erroneous tendencies was the main reason for Muravyov's success.

    The issue of mastering and using the strategic reserve played a decisive role in the entire battle, as shown in the film. Maintaining a strong reserve as much as possible and never using it in a scattered and piecemeal manner is implementing the important strategic thought of "putting all efforts into the attack." Therefore, the reason to strictly control it is not for anything else, but for the victory of the entire front. Putting the reserve into battle prematurely or inappropriately will lose elasticity, delay the opportunity, and affect the overall situation.

    In the film, the issue of using the reserve is mentioned three times: Vinogradov prepared to use the reserve to cover the troops in the city to evacuate the city; Krivenko requested to increase the reserve to him in order to retake the positions on the river bank; Muravyov did not relax a step. When the enemy invested its largest force in a fierce offensive, it was precisely when the city was most strained and favorable conditions were gradually maturing, the scene of city defense commander Lieutenant General Panteleev requesting Muravyov to increase the reserve was very vivid! (Pan, wanting three divisions for the sake of defending the city, Muravyov, considering the overall situation, finally only agreed to give Pan two divisions; after the discussion became a decision, they both happily expressed their inner thoughts. Muravyov said: "I thought you and I wanted four divisions!" Pan said: "I thought you would only give me one!" So they both felt that they had "earned" something and smiled with satisfaction.) Although it was a small interlude, it accurately and profoundly depicted the two typical states of mind under two different circumstances! The reserve's availability for use has marked the accelerated arrival of victory.

    Another important reason is: if the reserve was used too early, in that situation, it would only benefit the enemy (the same is true from the enemy's perspective). Because: if used less, it would be taken advantage of by the enemy—the enemy had mastered ten divisions of reserve forces, placed in mobile positions, in order to cope with possible sudden changes and prepare to hunt for reinforcements—if used more, it would prematurely expose its own strength, and the enemy would break away from the battlefield, fundamentally changing the situation; this move had long been anticipated and resolutely implemented by Muravyov.

    In the sea of fire of Stalingrad, the heroic defenders who held their ground and fought for every house, withstood the test and completed the glorious strategic tasks they were assigned! Sergeant Pavlov and his soldiers are the most outstanding model! Due to the continuous and unremitting battles of the heroic Red Army commanders and fighters and the Soviet people day and night, favorable conditions (don't forget, time!) were created!—That is to say, after countless repeated struggles, they held on! And inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, forcing the enemy to repeatedly put mobile forces into new offensives. Secondly, the enemy underestimated the strength of the Red Army, and before they had time to escape, they never realized that the powerful striking force of the invincible Red Army, which was about to drive them to death, had begun to advance towards them; furthermore, due to the threat of winter and Hitler's attempt to salvage his bankrupt "bragging," he was forced to launch a full-scale offensive, etc.—the conditions for a great victory matured!

    Marshal Stalin's order came, and the powerful reserve corps, which had been impatient, no longer "picked mushrooms" or "caught quails" in the secluded mountains and forests.—This is Muravyov's humor. Everything was carried out with extraordinary precision according to the order of the great Stalin, thus creating an unprecedented and most glorious great victory.

    This victory also belongs to the progressive people of the world!

    The film "The Great Turning Point" centrally reflects the brilliant victory of the great Stalin's military science, and how, under his guidance and cultivation, his "science of victory" is implemented among various commanders of different types, becoming the leading factor of victory. Therefore, "The Great Turning Point" has universal military educational significance. If we look at it from the ideological situation it displays, there are many places that are not unfamiliar to us, and have even happened around us, which is why it has practical educational significance for us. At the same time, it also explains why it makes us feel close and extremely interested.

　　试谈《大转变》的军事思想
    丁里
    《大转变》（注）——这一部以斯大林格勒战役为背景的军事艺术片，它给了我们，特别是在军队中工作的同志以极深刻的印象，主要的，表现在军事思想方面。
    看完了影片之后，我得到了这样一种认识：坚决保卫斯大林格勒，并不仅仅是为了达到对城市防御的目的，它只是整个战役的一个重要的步骤；通过它，也就是说，更重要的是以防御的手段，争取适当的时机与有利条件的成熟，按照预定的计划，给敌人以无可逃避的全部包围歼灭。我想，《大转变》中所表现的基本的战略意图便在于此；因之，坚决保卫城市是有重大的战略意义的，那就是迫使敌人以更大的甚至是全部兵力投入进攻，把他们装入口袋，而一举歼灭之。
    在影片中的前线总指挥穆拉维约夫上将是作为斯大林式的指挥员的典型同我们见面的。在他受命指挥战线之先，前线指挥得很糟，几乎是处在一再失利而又极端严重的情况中，那主要的是由于威诺格拉道夫上将（老的将领，后留任副职），缺乏战略眼光，不能贯彻大本营的战略意图，没有高度的战略思想，机械地单纯地进行了“防御”，结果，不得不一退再退，造成危局（克里文告中将曾对穆拉维约夫谈到“在威诺格拉道夫防御之下，敌人可以进至乌拉尔”的俏皮话，倒是很中肯的）；他甚至于拟定了极危险的撤出城市的计划，从他的经验主义出发，他要把部队撤到伏尔加河的彼岸，想利用天然的屏障再进行新的防御了。穆拉维约夫纠正了他，停止撤退，“要坚决挡住敌人，不仅要挡住敌人，还要以积极的进攻来击溃敌人，使之不能恢复”。这样的决定是极为重要的。由于这样的措置，他把消极的防御变为积极的防御——以机动果敢的攻击行动削弱敌人的实力，疲惫敌人的攻势，这就逐渐创造了有利条件；把被动的态势转为争取主动；克服了撤退思想，恢复了战胜的信心，战局开始改观了。
    克里文告中将同样缺乏远见，并且看不到全局；满足于追求属于自己部属的微小的胜利；他不满于威诺格拉道夫的防御，力主攻击敌人，虽然积极求战的精神是好的，但实质上是一个拚命主义的冒险者，他并不是从全局的利益出发的，当穆拉维约夫命令他向敌人侧翼进攻时，他是不满于“又是替别人打仗”的。
    穆拉维约夫，按照大本营的意图，在纠正着这种或左或右的思想。
    威诺格拉道夫与克里文告，他们还有一个共同的特点是缺乏自信，这是与军事情况的失利互为因果的。威诺格拉道夫曾热中于第二战场的开辟，天真地认为退出城市就会出现第二战场来解救危局。穆拉维约夫纠正了他，告诉他：“第二战场是由我们来决定的！”这样使他清醒过来。
    当城市危急时，为了军事上的需要，穆拉维约夫决定克里文告担任城防司令，他拒绝了；马上，他就受到了撤职的处分，而由工兵中将潘特列夫担任他的工作。这表现了布尔塞维克的原则精神，与军队的高度的纪律性。虽然他们是老战友，感情深厚。但是，人民的利益是丝毫不容许与友情相混淆的。事后前线军委会委员顾虑到这样处理会影响到别人对克里文告的信任而向穆拉维约夫提供意见时，他是这样回答的：“如果他自己都不信任自己，别人还是不要信任他好！”这样严肃不苟的与错误倾向作斗争的精神是穆拉维约夫获得成功的主要的原因。
    战略预备队的掌握与使用的问题，在影片中显示了它对整个战役的决定作用。尽量地保持着强大的预备队，绝不分散地零星使用，这是贯彻着“把全力放在打击上”这个重要的战略思想的。所以要严格地掌握它不是为了别的，而是为了整个战线的胜利，过早地或不适当地把预备队投入战斗，就会失却弹力，贻误战机，影响全局。
    在影片中有三次提起使用预备队问题：威诺格拉道夫准备用预备队掩护城中的部队撤出城市；克里文告要求增调预备队给他，以便夺回河岸的阵地；穆拉维约夫毫没放松一步。当敌人投入最大的兵力猛烈进攻时，也正是城市最吃紧和有利条件渐近成熟时，城防司令潘特列夫中将向穆拉维约夫要求增调预备队的一节是很生动的！（潘，为了保卫城市着想要求要三个师，穆从全局着想，最后只答应给潘两个师；商讨变成决定之后，他俩都很愉快地说出了心里的话。穆说：“我以为你和我要四个师哩！”潘说：“我以为你只肯给我一个哩！”于是他俩人都感到是“赚了”而满意地笑了。）虽然是一个小小的插话，它准确而深刻地描写了两种不同情况下的两种典型的心境！预备队的可以动用，已标志着胜利的加速到来。
    另外一个重要的原因是：如果过早地使用了预备队，在那样的情况下，是只会对敌人有利的（从敌人方面看也是如此）。因为：假如使用的少就会为敌人所乘，——敌人曾掌握了十个师的预备队，摆在机动位置，就是为了应付可能发生的突然变化和准备猎取增援部队的。——假如使用的多了，就会过早地暴露自己的力量，敌人就会摆脱开战场，使情况发生根本的变化；这一着是早已在预料之中而由穆拉维约夫坚决地执行了。
    在斯大林格勒的火海中，坚守阵地，逐屋争夺的英勇的保卫者们，是经得起考验和完成了所担负的光辉的战略任务的！巴甫洛夫中士和他的战士们，就是最突出的典范！由于英勇的红军指战员及苏联人民的日日夜夜持续不倦的战斗，把有利条件（不要忘记，时间！）造成了！——那就是说，经过无数次无数次的反复争夺，守住了！并且予敌人以惨重的杀伤，迫使敌人一次再次地把机动兵力投入新的进攻。其次，敌人过低估计了红军的力量，在他们来得及逃脱之前，从未觉察到，要把他们驱向死亡的无敌红军的强大打击力量，已开始向他们前进；再就是，由于冬季的威胁以及希特勒企图挽回濒于破产的“吹牛”而被迫全力进攻等等，——伟大胜利的条件成熟了！
    斯大林大元帅的命令来了，早已急不可待的强大预备兵团，不再在幽僻的山林中“采蘑菇”或“抓鹌鹑”了。——这是穆拉维约夫的幽默。一切都按照伟大斯大林的命令，异常准确地进行着，这样就创造了史无前例的最光辉的伟大的胜利。
    这胜利也是属于全世界的进步人类的！
    《大转变》这部电影，集中地反映伟大斯大林的军事科学的辉煌的胜利，以及在他指导培育之下如何使他的“致胜科学”在不同典型的各个指挥员之间得到贯彻，而成为胜利的主导因素。因此，《大转变》具有普遍的军事教育的意义。如果从所展示的思想状况来看，有很多地方对我们并不是陌生的，甚至曾经在我们周围也发生过，这就是它对我们也会发生实际教育意义的原因。同时也说明了它为什么会是使我们感到是亲切的，和极感兴味的。
