　　Korean Flying General Xu Zubi
　　By Wu Erke et al.
    The air raid siren sounded over Pyongyang. It was a periodic air raid warning. People hurriedly hid, awaiting the bandit-like attacks of American bombers.
    However, the sky above the city remained calm, with only faint explosions heard in the distance. Not long after, a radio report announced that the air raid threat had been lifted. It was only clear the next morning that a small squadron led by the young Korean Flying General Xu Zubi (transliteration) had intercepted several American planes headed for Pyongyang.
    Xu Zubi and his comrades fought against four Truman fighter planes and two escorting destroyers. In this air battle, the Korean pilots shot down one destroyer and drove away the remaining American planes.
    The aerial bandits dropped their bombs haphazardly into the wilderness, trying to escape to the Suwon airfield, which was still controlled by the Li bandit gang at the time. However, Xu Zubi's squadron did not stop pursuing the enemy and finally shot down the enemy planes over the Suwon airfield. The six aircraft of the American murderers would never come again to bomb peaceful cities!
    This is just one of the many glorious episodes in the combat career of Korean Flying General Xu Zubi and his small squadron of pilots.

　　朝鲜飞将军徐祖弼
　　伍尔克等作
    在平壤上空鸣起了警报的汽笛。这是周期性的空袭警报。人们匆忙地隐避起来，等待着美国轰炸机的强盗式的袭击。
    但是，城市上空却依旧是平静无事，只是从远处传来隐隐约约的爆炸声。过了不多时，无线电报告说，空袭的威胁已经解除。在第二天早晨才弄清楚：年轻的朝鲜飞将军徐祖弼（译音）的一个小队拦住了飞往平壤的几架美机的去路。
    徐祖弼和他的战友们，和四架杜鲁门的战斗机、两架随行的驱逐机作战。在这场空战中，朝鲜的飞行员们击毁了一架驱逐机并把其余的几架美机赶跑了。
    空中的强盗们，把炸弹乱投到旷野上，想逃到当时还控制在李匪手里的水原飞机场避难。但是，徐祖弼的一个小队并没有停止追击敌人，终于在水原机场上空把敌机击落在地面上。美国凶手的六架飞机从此永远不会再来轰炸和平的城市了！
    这不过是朝鲜飞将军徐祖弼和他一小队的飞行员们战斗事业中许多光荣的插曲之一而已。（万峰译自今年七月十二日苏联《文学报》。原载东北日报。本文系节录）
