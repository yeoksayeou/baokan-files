　　The People Rely on the Government, the Government Relies on the People
    ——Notes from a Visit to the Heavily Afflicted Area of Wuhe County, Northern Anhui
    Li Gengzheng
    "Walking a thousand, walking ten thousand, nothing beats the banks of the Huai River!" This old saying illustrates the rich agricultural production along the Huai River. In the past, the people of northern Anhui were proud of this. But since 1938, floods have ravaged the area every year, bringing famine, poverty, disease, and death. "For thirteen years, this good land hasn't seen a harvest!" This is the lament of the people of northern Anhui, a haunting reminder of the hatred left by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' breaching of the Yellow River at Huayuankou – a blood debt!
    This year's flooding in northern Anhui is quite severe. The local elders say, "Only the floods during the Guangxu era were this big, but even those were a little less severe than this year!" In addition to the fundamental reason of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's breach of the Yellow River at Huayuankou, which destroyed the basic river system of northern Anhui, the abundant rainfall, the wide area covered by the rain, and the long duration of the rain are important reasons for this year's unprecedented flooding in northern Anhui.
    In order to deeply understand the suffering of the disaster victims and to stabilize the pessimistic and disappointed sentiments of the disaster victims and some cadres, the Central People's Government organized the Central慰問团 (Comfort Group) to visit the disaster areas of northern Anhui and Henan on August 9th. The two groups sent to northern Anhui – the Suxian Prefecture group and the Fuyang Prefecture group – returned to Beijing on the 18th of this month.
    The Suxian Prefecture group, consisting of five people, selected Wuhe County, the area most severely affected by the disaster, as their target. Over four days, they visited seven administrative villages (including more than ten natural villages).
    Wuhe County is located more than 200 li southeast of Suxian County seat. The terrain is low-lying, and the rivers crisscross. It is the confluence of the five rivers – Huai, Hui, Chong, Tong, and Tuo. There are also lakes such as Tianjing Lake, Tuo Lake, Longtan Lake, Gaojia Lake, Caijia Lake, Sanyi Lake, and Huayuan Lake distributed throughout the area. Since the breach at Huayuankou in 1938, the lakes and rivers have become silted up, reducing their flow capacity. This year the water is vast, and the Huai River is backflowing into the inland rivers. The water level above Linhuaiguan has exceeded the 1931 flood level by eight inches. The embankment soil is generally soaked through. On July 26th, the Huai embankment at Xiaolizhuang in the Ludong district breached, causing a major disaster. Of the county's 99 townships, 85 were flooded (those not flooded showed signs of drought due to recent lack of rain), affecting a population of over 293,100 people, accounting for three-quarters of the county's total population. Over 1.3 million mu of land were flooded, accounting for two-thirds of the county's land. Over 13,600 houses were destroyed. 39 people drowned (mostly due to overturned boats or going into the water to retrieve firewood). Currently, over 30,000 households, or about 150,000 people, are in urgent need of relief.
    However, the people of northern Anhui are confident in overcoming the disaster. Last year's reality is: the disaster was overcome. The cadres have experience in overcoming the disaster, and the masses have confidence in the government's leadership in disaster relief. Knowing that the government is actively trying to find solutions, the masses are also working hard to produce and save themselves. Xibakou is a village that suffered a relatively severe disaster. The local people are collecting water chestnut sprouts to replace food. Based on the experience that "even if you don't plant the fields by the Beginning of Autumn, you can still plant something to eat for half a year" and the spirit of "plant every inch as the water recedes," they are actively rushing to plant late autumn crops. Last year, when the disaster relief started, everyone suspected that the government had this ability and were unwilling to attend meetings. This year is different. As soon as the gong sounds in each village, the farmers all gather to offer opinions and discuss problems. A farmer in Rongduzhuang said, "Isn't it good to have meetings! Meetings are the best way to solve problems."
    The government's method of using work as a form of relief has received the enthusiastic support of the masses. When Wu Dengen, the head of the Civil Affairs Section of the Suxian Prefectural Office, reported to the farmers of Mohekou the instructions of Chairman Mao's determination to control the Huai River, the masses' eyes shone with gratitude. "Let's start work as soon as the water recedes!" "Start work quickly, everyone contribute to building the dam!" "As long as we start work, everything will be all right!" ("管" means "success" or "will work") Everyone spoke at once, their emotions exceptionally excited.
    Every time we arrived at a village, the people, seeing us from afar, would rush to the shore to greet us. Knowing that we were sent by the Central Committee, they were even more excited. They boiled water, brought benches, and warmly welcomed us. We told them, "Chairman Mao sent us to see you, Chairman Mao sends his regards to everyone!" We comforted them, saying, "The harvest is good in other places this year. Chairman Mao wants to save you, so how could he not have a solution? Everyone, don't worry." Many people were moved to tears, saying, "As long as Chairman Mao knows, we are willing to starve to death." "Without Chairman Mao, how could we have lived to this day!" "Without the People's Government, we would have starved to death last year!" "Chairman Mao knows we have a disaster here, so we'll be taken care of." This is the people's true feeling. The people trust their government and support their leader.
    Ling Shaozhang, a 72-year-old man from Xibakou, wiped away his tears and said, "Chiang Kai-shek is truly hateful! For more than ten years, he has made us common people suffer so much from floods!" The hatred of millions of people is interwoven into an incomparably strong force. In emergency rushes such as rescue and relief, the local cadres and the people showed unparalleled heroism. Communist Party members and Youth League members played a leading role, demonstrating a high degree of love and responsibility for the people. Many people were injured and bled while blocking breaches and building weirs in the rapids, but they refused to stop working. Most of the cadres of the county government were sick, but they still ran around all day, trying to find solutions and solve difficulties for the disaster victims. Some comrades from the Central Anti-Epidemic Team were doing medical and vaccination work at the disaster victim evacuation stations. They worked hard day and night, and their lives were difficult; but they were happy and full of energy. Because they went deep into the masses and patiently explained and propagated, the people all voluntarily requested vaccinations.
    As long as the people rely on the government and the government relies on the people, what is there that cannot be done? What disaster cannot be overcome? We can not only defeat the bloody rule of the reactionaries, but also overcome any disasters they create!
    An old woman in Shishuyuan, Gao Lake Township, fell ill with an acute illness. We used the first aid medicine we carried with us to relieve her pain. She was so moved that she cried and said to us with tears in her eyes, "Please thank Chairman Mao for his concern when you go back!"
    Yes, thank Chairman Mao! The Huai River control project is about to begin. Everyone will work, everyone will eat, and millions upon millions of working people will exert their boundless power to build dams, dig rivers, repair embankments, and excavate ditches. A great and moving scene will appear before our eyes. In two or three years, the banks of the Huai River will no longer see endless floods, nor will there be displaced people suffering from hunger and disease. The people of northern Anhui, who have suffered from disasters for more than ten years, will have years of plenty!
    "Walking a thousand, walking ten thousand, nothing beats the banks of the Huai River!" This saying will describe the new situation and new atmosphere on the banks of the Huai River!

　　人民依靠政府，政府依靠人民
    ——皖北五河县重灾区访问杂记
    李赓铮
    “走千走万，不如淮河两岸！”这句老话，可以说明淮河两岸农产富庶的情况，皖北的老百姓过去一向是以此自豪的。但是自一九三八年以来，年年洪水泛滥，给人们带来饥馑、贫病和死亡。“整整十三年了，这么一片好地方，见不到收成！”这是皖北老百姓的叹息，是蒋匪在花园口决堤所留下的使人难以忘却的仇恨，血的仇恨！
    今年皖北的水灾，是相当严重的。当地的老年人都这样说：“只有光绪年间见到过这样大的水，但比今年还差点呢！”除了蒋介石匪帮在花园口黄河决堤冲毁了皖北河流系统的基本原因以外；雨多，下雨面积广，时间长，是今年造成皖北空前水患的重要原因。
    为了要深入了解灾胞的疾苦，并安定灾民与部分干部的悲观失望情绪，中央人民政府组织了中央慰问团于八月九日赴皖北、河南等灾区进行慰问。去皖北的两组——宿县专区组与阜阳专区组，已于本月十八日返京。
    宿县专区组一行五人，选定了灾情最严重的五河县区为目标，四天时间，访问了七个行政村（包括十几个自然村）。
    五河县在宿县县城东南二百余里处，地势低洼，河流交错，是淮、浍、漴、潼、沱五河汇流之处，又有天井湖、沱湖、龙潭湖、郜家湖、蔡家湖、三义湖、花园湖等分布全境。自一九三八年花园口决口后，湖河均形淤塞，流量缩减。今年水势浩大，淮水向内河倒灌，临淮关以上已超过一九三一年洪水位八公寸。堤土普遍被浸透，七月二十六日，路东区小李庄淮堤决口，酿成巨灾。全县九十九个乡，被淹了八十五个（未淹者因近来缺雨又呈旱象），受灾人口二十九万三千一百余人，占全县总人口的四分之三，淹地一百三十余万亩，占全县土地的三分之二，倒房一万三千六百余间，淹死三十九人（多因船翻或下水捞柴草所致），目前急需救济者三万余户，约十五万人。
    但是，皖北人民对战胜灾荒是有信心的。去年的事实是：战胜了灾荒。干部们对战胜灾荒已有了经验，群众对政府领导救灾也有信心。知道政府在积极想办法，群众也就努力生产自救。西坝口是灾情较重的一个村庄，当地的老百姓捞菱角秧子代替食品，他们本着“处暑不种田，将就种上也能吃半年”的经验，和“水落一寸种一寸”的精神，积极抢种晚秋。去年救灾，最初大家怀疑政府有此力量，不愿意开会。今年不同了，各村农民只要听锣声一响，就全聚拢了来，提意见，谈问题。荣渡庄一个农民说：“开会还不好！开会最能解决问题。”
    政府以工代赈的办法，得到群众的热烈拥护。当宿县专署民政科长吴登岸向沫河口的农民报告毛主席决心治淮的指示时，群众的眼里发出了感戴的光辉。“水退早开工吧！”“快开工，大家出力打坝子！”“只要开工就管喽！”（“管”，是“成”、“行”的意思）你一言，我一语，情绪异常兴奋。
    每到一个村庄，老百姓远远地看见我们来了，就都赶到岸边迎接，知道是中央派来的人，就更加兴奋了。烧水，搬凳子，热诚地招待我们。我们告诉他们说：“毛主席派我们来看你们，毛主席问大家好！”我们安慰他们说：“今年各地收成不错，毛主席要救你们，还会没办法吗？大家放心吧。”许多人感动得流出眼泪来，说：“只要毛主席知道，饿死也甘心了。”“没有毛主席，我们那会活到今天！”“没有人民政府，去年早就饿死了！”“毛主席也知道我们这里有灾，那就管了。”这是人民真实的情感，人民信任自己的政府，拥护自己的领袖。
    西坝口七十二岁的老人凌绍章擦干了眼泪说：“蒋介石真可恨！十几年来，把我们老百姓淹得好苦啊！”千万人的愤恨交织成无比坚强的力量，在抢险，抢救等紧急突击工作中，当地的干部与人民表现了无比的英勇。共产党员、青年团员们都起了带头作用，发扬了高度对人民的热爱与责任感。许多人在急流中堵口、打堰，受了重伤，流了血，但他们不肯停止工作。县政府的干部，多数生了病，但是还整天向外跑，给灾民想办法，解决困难。中央防疫队的一部分同志，在灾民疏散站上作医疗、注射工作。他们日夜辛劳，生活艰苦；但是心情愉快，精神饱满。由于他们深入群众，耐心地宣传解释，老百姓全自动要求打防疫针。
    只要人民依靠政府，政府依靠人民，还有什么事情做不好？什么灾荒度不过？我们既能打垮反动派的血腥统治，也就能战胜他们所制造的任何灾难！
    郜湖乡柿树园的一位老大娘得了急症，我们用随身携带的急救药解除了她的痛苦，她感动得哭了，含着泪向我们说：“回去替我好好谢谢毛主席的关怀吧！”
    是的，谢谢毛主席吧！治淮的工程就要开始了，大家劳动，大家吃饭，千千万万的劳动人民，就要发挥他们无限的力量，打坝、挖河、修堤、掘沟，伟大动人的场面就要呈现在我们眼前了。两三年后，淮河两岸将再也见不到滔滔不尽的洪水，再也不会有流离失所，饥病交迫的灾民，十几年来受尽灾难的皖北人民，将获得丰衣足食的岁月！
    “走千走万，不如淮河两岸！”这句话，将要说明淮河两岸新的情况，新的气象！
