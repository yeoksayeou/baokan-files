    "Hero Tank"
    Written in Commemoration of the Twenty-Third Anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day
    Lan Man
    October 1st of last year,
    On the day of the founding ceremony,
    In front of Tiananmen Square,
    To the rhythm of military music,
    Marched rows of
    Infantry, cavalry, and artillery.
    Then came the armored forces.
    A burst of motorcycle sound,
    The first large tank
    Appeared on the parade ground.
    On top of the turret
    Fluttered a red flag—
    "Hero Tank"

    "August 15th"
    When Japanese imperialism surrendered,
    They blew up the railways,
    Burned down the factories,
    Threw weapons into the river,
    Blew up the wheels of tanks,
    Burned out the engines,
    Threw the parts into the gullies.

    Braving the cold wind and snowflakes,
    We went into the forests;
    Risking landmines,
    We drilled into the caves.
    In Hafo, we found the wheels,
    In Heihe, we found the generator,
    In Gongzhuling, we found the electric pump,
    The fuel injector was found in Manzhouli.
    After untold hardships,
    We gathered all the parts.

    Without a battery,
    The machine could not start,
    Human power replaced the motor,
    From this street,
    Pulled to that road.
    Pull!
    Pull!
    The exhaust pipe began to smoke.
    This tank that had died
    Finally resurrected in the hands of revolutionaries.

    The tank became our teacher,
    We began to learn.
    In the wind and snow,
    We kept it company all night.
    In winter, we warmed it,
    When it rained, we put a raincoat on it.
    If it was dirty,
    Everyone rushed to wash it.
    In the hot summer,
    We got into the car,
    Like entering a steamer.
    Covered in sweat,
    We lay under the car repairing it,
    Rolling around covered in grease.
    Wiping sweat with our hands,
    Our faces were painted like the bottom of a pot.
    Just like that,
    The "Hero Tank"
    Taught us how to drive,
    Taught us how to repair,
    Taught us how to shoot.

    Three times across the south of the Yangtze, (Note)
    The tank and us
    Were always together.
    Together we crossed the great snowy plains of northern Manchuria,
    Together we crossed the frozen Songhua River.
    In the pitch-black night
    Together we moved forward against the snow wind!
    We captured Kaoshantun,
    Annihilated the enemy's cavalry brigade,
    On the outskirts of Dehui
    Destroyed the enemy's "permanent" fortifications.
    Cut off the enemy's spider legs,
    Trapped the enemy in a jar.

    On the way into the pass,
    The tracks kicked up thousands of miles of dust.
    The tankers
    Holding up small red flags of command,
    Raced across the plains,
    Crossed the mountains.
    On January 14th
    The "Hero Tank"
    Courageously fought into Tianjin.
    In the roar of the tank guns,
    The enemy's bunkers blossomed.
    The enemy raised the white flag.

    The "Hero Tank"
    Participated in the
    Founding Ceremony of the People's Republic of China.
    It walked at the forefront of the armored forces,
    Followed by
    One,
    Two,
    Countless,
    Majestically drove past
    Chairman Mao,
    Like a loyal and brave warrior
    Accepting the great leader's review. …
    Today,
    This steel warrior,
    The "Hero Tank,"
    Is stationed on the border of the motherland,
    Defending the land of the motherland.
    (Note) "South of the Yangtze" refers to the south of the Songhua River.

　　“功臣号”坦克
    为纪念“八一”建军节二十三周年而作
    蓝曼
    去年十月一日，
    开国大典的那天，
    在天安门前，
    和着军乐的节奏
    走过一队队的
    步兵，骑兵和炮兵。
    接着是装甲部队。
    一阵摩托声，
    第一辆大坦克
    出现在阅兵场上。
    在炮塔的顶上
    飞舞着一面红旗——
    “功臣号”
　
    “八·一五”
    日本帝国主义者投降的时候，
    他们把铁路炸了，
    把工厂烧了，
    把武器丢在河里，
    把坦克炸坏了轮子，
    烧坏了机器，
    把零件扔在山沟里。
　
    顶着寒风和雪花，
    我们走进森林；
    冒着地雷的危险，
    我们钻进山洞。
    在哈福我们找到了轮子，
    在黑河我们找到了发电机，
    以公主岭我们找到了电邦浦，
    喷油嘴是在满洲里找到的。
    经过千辛万苦
    我们把一件件零件找齐。
　
    没有电瓶，
    机器不能发动，
    人力代替动力马达，
    从这条街，
    拉到那条路。
    拉呀！
    拉呀！
    排气筒开始冒烟。
    这已经死去了的坦克
    终于复活在革命者的手里。
　
    坦克做了我们的老师，
    我们开始了学习。
    在风雪吹打的夜里，
    我们和它整夜作伴。
    冬天我们为它取暖，
    落雨给它披上雨衣。
    身体脏了，
    大家抢着给它洗。
    在炎热的暑天，
    我们钻进车里，
    象进了蒸笼。
    带着满身大汗，
    我们躺在车下修理，
    滚得满身油泥。
    用手擦一把汗，
    脸涂得象锅底。
    就这样的，
    “功臣号”坦克
    教会了我们驾驶，
    教会了我们修理，
    教会了我们射击。
　
    三下江南，（注）
    坦克和我们
    始终在一起。
    一起踏过北满的大雪原，
    一起渡过结冰的松花江。
    在漆黑的夜里
    一起顶着雪风前进！
    我们攻下了靠山屯，
    歼灭了敌人的骑兵旅，
    在德惠外围
    摧毁了敌人“永久性”的工事。
    把敌人的蜘蛛脚切断，
    把敌人困在瓮里。
　
    在进关的路上，
    履带扬起万里风沙。
    坦克手们
    举着指挥的小红旗，
    驰过了平原，
    越过了山地。
    一月十四日
    “功臣号”坦克
    奋勇地打进了天津。
    在坦克炮的吼叫里，
    敌人的地堡开了花。
    敌人举起了白旗。
　
    “功臣号”坦克
    参加了
    中华人民共和国开国典礼。
    它走在装甲部队的最前面，
    紧接着
    一辆，
    两辆，
    无数辆，
    威武地驶过
    毛主席的面前，
    象一个忠勇的战士
    接受着伟大领袖的检阅。……
    今天，
    这钢铁的战士，
    “功臣号”坦克，
    正驻守在祖国的边疆，
    捍卫着祖国的土地。
    （注）“江南”指松花江南。
