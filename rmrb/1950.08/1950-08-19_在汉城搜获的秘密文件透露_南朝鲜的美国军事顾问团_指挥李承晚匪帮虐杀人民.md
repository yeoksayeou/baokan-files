According to a dispatch from the Korean Central News Agency's General Branch in China: The U.S. Military Advisory Group stationed in South Korea directed and supervised the Syngman Rhee gang in cruelly massacring the people.

The following "secret document" was found in the headquarters of the U.S. Military Advisory Group in Seoul. This document clearly proves that the massacre of the people by the Syngman Rhee army during the Yeosu-Suncheon uprising at the end of October 1948 was carried out under the direct command and supervision of the U.S. Military Advisory Group.

The original document is in English, and the full translation is as follows:

    U.S. Military Intelligence Unit 9711, Daejeon Office
    Army Field Bureau 235
           January 27, 1949
    Regarding the Execution of Military Prisoners

    Simple Intelligence (1040-1490)

    On January 27, 1949, it is scheduled to shoot arrested soldiers near the Daejeon Detention Center.

    Upon arrival at the execution site, it was found that the preparations for the execution were insufficient. At 10:30 a.m., twenty blindfolded prisoners were pulled out and tied to the posts one by one. There was no medical officer at the execution site, and there were only ten shooters to shoot these twenty prisoners.

    The advisor of the 2nd Brigade of the Korean Army stopped the execution. He insisted that a medical officer should participate at the execution site and that ten more shooters should be added. Otherwise, it is most suitable to shoot ten people at a time.

    So ten prisoners were untied from the posts and pulled to the back. Later, a medical officer and ten shooters arrived, and the final preparations were completed at 11:30, and the shooting began. Ten prisoners were tied to the posts again. The shooters were instructed which post each of them should shoot at. The shooters aimed at the designated prisoners and fired the number of bullets according to the order.

    Each round of shooting fired a row of MN rifle bullets.

    Secondly, the colonel in charge of the shooting and the military discipline team arrived at the shooting range and, seeing prisoners who were still alive, shot them again with one to three bullets. There was even a third shooting. The medical officer went to the shooting range to inspect and announced that the prisoners were all dead, and then untied the bodies and pulled them to the already dug pit. While burying them in the pit, gunshots were heard again, presumably for fear that the corpses were still alive, so they were shot at.

    A total of four groups were shot. The first group had twenty people, the second group had eighteen people, the third group also had eighteen people, and the fourth group had thirteen people, totaling sixty-nine people. The first group was shot at approximately 11:30 a.m., and the subsequent groups were shot in sequence before 12:15 p.m.

    The people who were shot belonged to the 14th Regiment from Yeosu and Suncheon (note: referring to the insurgent troops of the Syngman Rhee puppet "National Defense Army" - editor). They all looked very young, the oldest being only eighteen years old. The people who were killed were barefoot, without shirts, and some were not wearing military uniforms.

    When the first group was pulled to the posts, the others who were being sent on trucks also arrived at the posts and were tied up.

    One very young person tied to the post sang a battle song of communism, and the others joined in the singing. The people on the truck sang a Korean military song from the side. Most of the prisoners who were killed declared themselves innocent.

　　在汉城搜获的秘密文件透露
    南朝鲜的美国军事顾问团  指挥李承晚匪帮虐杀人民
    【本报讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社驻华总分社消息：留驻南朝鲜的美国军事顾问团指挥着并监督着李承晚匪帮残忍地虐杀人民。
    下面发表的“秘密文件”是从汉城美国军事顾问团总部中找出来的。这个文件清楚的证明了：关于一九四八年十月底对丽水顺天的起义的李承晚军队虐杀事件是在美国军事顾问团直接指挥监督下实行的。
    这个文件原文是英文，现翻译全文如下：
    美国军事情报处九七一支队大田区办公处
    陆军野战局二三五
           一九四九年一月二十七日
    关于军事俘虏的处决案
    简单的情报（一○四○——一四九○）
    一九四九年一月二十七日，预定在大田收容所附近，枪杀被逮捕的士兵。
    到了执刑的地点，发现行刑的准备不够。十点三十分时，拉出来的被蒙上双目的二十名囚犯，一个个地被捆在柱子上。行刑地点没有医务上校，并且为枪杀这二十名囚犯的射手也只有十名。
    韩国军第二旅的顾问停止了行刑，他主张在行刑地点应请医务上校参加，并增派十名射手。如果不然，每次枪杀十名最适合。
    于是将十名囚犯从柱上解下，拉到后面。随后一个医务上校和十名射手来到了，十一点三十分最后准备完成，开始枪杀。十个囚犯再被捆在柱子上。射手们被指示他们每个人应射击的柱子。射手对准被指定的囚犯依着命令的子弹数目而射击了。
    每一回的总射击，射出ＭＮ小铳子弹一排。
    其次，指挥枪杀的上校和军纪队，到了射击场，看见尚有活气的囚犯，便向他们再次射击一发至三发子弹。甚至有第三次射击的。医务上校到射击场检视，宣布囚犯都死了，就把尸体解下来，拉到早已挖好的坑中，在埋入坑中时，又听见枪声，想系怕尸体还有活气而向之射击的。
    共枪杀了四群。第一群有二十名，第二群有十八名，第三群也有十八名，第四群有十三名，共计六十九名，约十一点三十分时枪杀第一群，以后顺序在十二点十五分以前都枪杀了。
    被枪杀的人们，属于丽水，顺天地方的十四团（按系李承晚伪“国防军”起义部队——编者）。他们都显得很年青，最大才十八岁的样子。被杀的人们，赤足，未着衬衫，也有的没穿士兵制服。
    第一群被拉到柱子旁时，其他的被送上汽车也到了柱旁，并被捆起来。
    被捆在柱上的有一极年青的人，唱出战斗的共产主义歌，其他人也都附合着唱了。汽车上的人在一旁，他们唱着朝鲜军歌。被杀的囚犯们，大都声明了自己是无罪的。
