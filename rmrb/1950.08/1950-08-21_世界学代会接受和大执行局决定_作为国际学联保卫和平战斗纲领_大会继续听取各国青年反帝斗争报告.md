　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague Dispatch from TASS: The Second World Student Congress continued its sessions on the 18th. The President of Charles University, Mr. Mugalzhovsky, expressed the respect of the professors, lecturers, and students of Czechoslovak higher institutions to the young peace advocates. Professor Thomson of Birmingham University in England, and Professor Jefferson of Copenhagen University, also paid their respects to the young peace advocates.

　　Professor Crowther, Chairman of the British Peace Committee, addressed the meeting, stating that students in capitalist countries should do everything in their power to struggle against the subordination of science to the purposes of preparing for war, and against the defilement of science by the governments of capitalist countries. Students in capitalist countries, when struggling for their own interests, should cooperate with the working class. They must understand that only the working class is their true friend.

　　The Egyptian democratic student representative, Masr, attending the Congress as an observer, described the situation of Egyptian students fighting alongside the entire people against British imperialism. Masr sincerely thanked the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies for supporting Egypt's struggle for independence in the Security Council, and pointed out that Egyptian students fully understand that only by fighting for peace can national independence be achieved.

　　The Finnish democratic student observer, Olie, spoke against the opinions of the official Finnish representative. As is well known, the official Finnish representative had supported the reactionary clamor of Jenkins and others from the British student delegation. On behalf of the Finnish democratic students, Olie expressed complete support for the activities of the International Union of Students.

　　The Colombian student representative, Villar, delivered a moving speech. He said that the National Union of Students of Colombia was formed in the struggle against the reactionary rule of Gómez, alongside the people. Villar described the guerrilla activities of the Colombian people against the Gómez government, and pointed out that Colombian students and youth played an active role in these activities. Villar angrily recounted the Colombian reactionary government's brutal suppression of the movement for Colombian independence, with many students having fallen victim to fascist terror. However, more than 50,000 people in Colombia have signed the Stockholm Appeal.

　　The General Secretary of the International Union of Students, Beringer, delivered a speech discussing the struggle of students from various countries for world peace. This concluded the morning session.

　　The afternoon session on the 18th was chaired by the head of the Soviet delegation, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee of the International Union of Students, Mr. Shelepin.

　　When the Republican Spanish student representative, Azkarate, spoke, he described the difficult situation of students in Franco's Spain, and the struggle of Spanish students against the fascist executioners, and expressed his strong confidence in the victory of the Spanish people.

　　The Greek female student, Jizen, said that Greek students are now fighting against the Greek royalist fascists. More than 5,000 Greek students have been killed or imprisoned by the fascist executioners. But this terror has not affected the national liberation struggle of Greek students, which is closely linked to the struggle for peace. Greek students actively participated in the campaign to collect signatures for the Peace Declaration. Two Greek students collected hundreds of peace signatures in one day. It must be stated that each time they sought signatures, they risked being arrested. Jizen warmly congratulated the Korean youth, and expressed solidarity with the Korean people who are fighting for their own freedom. Jizen finally declared that Greek youth will never participate in a war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, and shouted "Long live the powerful front of peace fighters headed by the great Stalin!" Her speech elicited warm applause, and the hall repeatedly resounded with cheers of "Stalin!"

　　The Chairman of the Czechoslovak Student Union, Belikan, spoke, reporting on the great achievements of Czech higher education, the situation of the Czech working class and working people receiving education in higher education institutions, and the participation of Czech students in the struggle for peace.

　　The delegates to the Congress listened enthusiastically to the report by the Chairman of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Bao Aishun, on the gains of the Prague meeting of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council. The delegates have accepted the decision of the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Council as the International Union of Students' program for defending world peace. (Attached picture)

　　世界学代会接受和大执行局决定
    作为国际学联保卫和平战斗纲领
    大会继续听取各国青年反帝斗争报告
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社布拉格讯：第二届世界学生代表大会十八日继续开会。卡罗夫大学校长穆加尔若夫斯基代表捷克斯洛伐克高等学府的教授、讲师和学生向年青的和平拥护者表示了敬意。英国伯明翰大学教授汤姆逊和哥本哈根大学教授杰凡逊也向年青的和平拥护者致敬。
    英国和平委员会主席克劳瑟教授到会发表演说称：各资本主义国家的学生应竭尽全力进行斗争，反对使科学屈从于准备战争的目的，反对各资本主义国家政府玷污科学。资本主义国家的学生为自己的利益而斗争时，应与工人阶级通力合作。他们必须了解：只有工人阶级才是他们真正的朋友。
    以观察员身份出席代表大会的埃及民主学生代表马斯尔讲述了埃及学生与全体人民并肩进行反对英帝国主义的斗争的情形。马斯尔衷心感激苏联和各人民民主国家在安理会支持埃及争取独立的斗争，并且指出埃及学生完全了解只有为和平而斗争，才能获得民族独立。
    芬兰民主学生的观察员奥列发言反对芬兰正式代表的意见。如所周知，芬兰正式代表已支持了英国学生代表团的詹金斯等的反动叫嚣。奥列代表芬兰民主学生表示完全拥护国际学联的活动。
    哥伦比亚学生代表维拉尔发表了动人的演讲。他说：哥伦比亚全国学生联合会是在与人民并肩反对哥迈兹反动统治的斗争中组成的。维拉尔描述了哥伦比亚人民反对哥迈兹政府的游击活动的情形，并指出哥伦比亚的学生与青年在这些活动中起着积极的作用。维拉尔愤怒地讲述了哥伦比亚反动政府残酷压镇争取哥伦比亚独立的运动，许多学生已经作了法西斯恐怖的牺牲者。但是哥伦比亚仍有五万多人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。
    国际学联总书记贝林格发表演说，论述了各国学生为世界和平而进行斗争的情形。至此结束了上午的会议。
    十八日下午会议由苏联代表团团长、国际学联执委会副主席谢利平担任主席。
    共和西班牙学生代表阿兹卡拉特发言时讲述了在佛朗哥西班牙学生所处的艰难境地，和西班牙学生反对法西斯刽子手的斗争，并表示了对西班牙人民的胜利的坚强信心。
    希腊女学生纪岑发言说：希腊学生现正与希腊保皇法西斯分子进行斗争。已有五千余希腊学生被法西斯刽子手们杀害或囚禁着。但这种恐怖毫未影响希腊学生所进行的与和平斗争紧密相连的民族解放斗争。希腊学生积极参加了为和平宣言征集签名的运动。有两个希腊学生在一天内征集了数百个和平签名。必须说明他们每次征求签名都是冒着被捕的危险的。纪岑向朝鲜青年热烈祝贺，并表示和争取自身自由的朝鲜人民休戚与共。纪岑最后宣称希腊青年决不参加反对苏联及人民民主国家的战争，并高呼“以伟大斯大林为首的强大的和平斗士阵线万岁！”她的讲演引起了热烈的掌声，会场上一再响彻了欢呼“斯大林！”的声音。
    捷克斯洛伐克学联主席贝利康发言，报告了捷克高等教育的巨大成就，捷克的工人阶级和劳动人民在高等教育机关受教育的情形，和捷克学生参加争取和平的斗争的情形。
    大会的代表热烈地听取了世界民主青年联盟主席鲍埃逊关于和大常委执行局布拉格会议的收获的报告。代表们已接受了和大常委会执行局的决定，作为国际学联保卫世界和平的战斗纲领。（附图片）
