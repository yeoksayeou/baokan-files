Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: The China Zhi Gong Party today issued a statement regarding the US imperialist planes' intrusion into our airspace. The full text is as follows:

　　On August 27th, military aircraft of US imperialism, which is invading Korea, dared to openly intrude into our Northeast airspace five times, and continuously strafed our people, buildings, as well as stations and vehicles. This deliberate provocative act by the US Air Force fully proves that Austin's statement on August 25th in response to Foreign Minister Zhou's accusations, namely that "the United States has not invaded Chinese territory, and the United States has not taken aggressive actions against China," is a complete and shameless lie.

　　We listened to this news with unparalleled indignation. The US imperialist aggression against Korea and our Taiwan has aroused the common indignation of our people and the people of the world. Now, it has directly invaded our mainland airspace, further revealing its aggressive nature. However, we want to warn the US imperialists: the territory, territorial waters, and airspace of the People's Republic of China are absolutely not to be violated! The Chinese people are determined to fight to the end to defend national sovereignty and safeguard world peace.

　　We firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's solemn protest to the US government, demanding that the US government immediately severely punish the US Air Force that ravaged our airspace this time, compensate for all the losses suffered by China, and withdraw all armed forces in Chinese territory, such as in Taiwan! At the same time, we firmly maintain that the Korean issue can only be resolved by the Korean people themselves, all foreign forces must be withdrawn immediately, and in the United Nations, all issues related to Korea must be discussed in meetings attended by the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. If US imperialists continue to be stubborn and continue their acts of aggression, we Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world will resist to the end, forcing them back to their old lair! This statement is made.

　　中国致公党发表声明  抗议美机侵犯我领空
    【新华社二十九日讯】中国致公党于本日发表对美帝飞机侵入我国领空声明，全文如下：
    八月二十七日美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜的军用飞机，竟敢公然五次侵入我国东北领空，并连续扫射我国人民、建筑物、以及车站和车辆。美帝空军这种蓄意的挑衅暴行，十足证明了八月二十五日奥斯汀对我国周外长的控诉所作声明中所谓“美国并未侵犯中国领土，美国也未对中国采取侵略行动”，完全为无耻的谎言。
    我们以无比的愤恨聆悉这种消息，美国帝国主义对于朝鲜和我国台湾的侵略，已为我全国人民以及全世界人民所共愤，而今更直接侵犯我国大陆领空，更表露出它侵略的本质。不过，我们要向美国帝国主义者警告：中华人民共和国的领土、领海、领空，是决不容许有任何侵犯的！中国人民对卫护国家主权和保卫世界和平，是有奋斗到底的决心的。
    我们坚决拥护周恩来外长向美国政府提出的严正抗议，要求美国政府立即严惩这次在中国领空肆虐的美国空军，赔偿中国所受的一切损失，并撤退在中国领土如在台湾方面的一切武装势力！同时，我们坚决主张朝鲜问题只有由朝鲜人民自己来解决，一切外国武力必须立刻撤退，而在联合国方面，必须由有中华人民共和国与苏联参加的会议来讨论与有关朝鲜的一切问题。美国帝国主义者如仍要顽梗不化，继续其侵略行为，我们中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民也必抗拒到底，使它退回老巢去！特此声明。
