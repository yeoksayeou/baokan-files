　　African Black People's Peace Signatures
    Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee, received a letter from Weedking Guilibali, a representative of the African Democratic Union, as follows: Dear Joliot:
    I have just attended a meeting under the trees to explain the full text of the Stockholm Declaration. Here, no one has ever talked to the Black farmers about the atomic bomb. But one night, just before dawn, gunshots were heard in our valley. Firelight replaced the morning glow and illuminated the valley—the entire village was about to be burned, and the peaceful residents of the countryside hurriedly ran along the valley and the edge of the forest to escape. This incident made it easy for people to imagine the terror the atomic bomb would bring them! Black people do not regard this weapon as a sign of the superiority of civilized people... There are veterans of the Great War of 1914-1918 here, and three people who were prisoners of war in the Great War of 1939-1945. I told the audience that signing the Stockholm Declaration would help eliminate the danger of war, and they crowded around me, forgetting that they could not write. How distressed they were at the time, because they could not write these mysterious and strange symbols called words. Only two newcomers in this village can write their names in Arabic script. The rest had to draw crosses or thumbprints. As a former teacher, I once again bitterly felt the "good intentions" of the civilization that more than half a century of French rule had brought to the Black people.
    We hold many meetings here. Black farmers often walk 20 to 30 kilometers of forest roads or mountain roads to attend the meetings. The sound of gongs informs the meeting from village to village. The meeting is sometimes attended by thousands of farmers. In Badokiolas (upper reaches of the Volta River), more than 10,000 people gathered on May 28 this year. At that time, we used three or four different ethnic dialects to explain the meaning of the Stockholm Declaration and the collection of signatures. Because even now, 90% of African Blacks are still illiterate. Therefore, fingerprints are often used instead of signatures.

### 非洲黑种人的和平签名

　　非洲黑种人的和平签名
    世界和大常委会主席约里奥·居里收到非洲民主联盟代表维得金·古里巴利的来信如下：亲爱的约里奥：
    我刚才出席过树荫下的大会，解释斯德哥尔摩宣言的全文。在这里，谁也没有和黑种农民谈起过原子弹。但是一天夜里，正在黎明以前，我们的山谷里却听到了枪声。火光代替了朝霞把山谷照亮了——整个村子要烧起来，农村中的和平居民连忙沿着山谷和森林边端奔跑逃命。这件事使人们容易想像原子弹会带给他们怎样的恐怖！黑人们是不把这种武器看作文明人的优越性的表征的……这儿有着一九一四——一九一八年大战的残废军人，还有三个人做过一九三九——一九四五年大战的俘虏。我对听众说，在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名，就可以帮助消灭战争的危险，他们便向我拥过来，忘掉自己的不会写字。他们当时是多么苦恼啊，因为他们不会写这神秘的、奇怪的叫做字的记号。这个村里只有两个新来者能够用阿拉伯字母写出自己的名字。其余的人们可就不得不画十字或者捺指印了。曾经做过教员的我，又一次辛酸地感到了半世纪以上的法国统治所带给黑人的那种文明的“好意”。
    我们在此地举行许多的大会。黑种农民往往走过二三十公里的林路或山路赶来赴会。铜锣的声音从这村到那村通知开会。大会有时是数千农民参加的。在巴多基乌拉斯（窝尔特河上游），今年五月二十八日集合了一万多人。那时我们就用三四种不同种族的土语来解释斯德哥尔摩宣言及征集签名的意义。因为直到现在，非洲黑人百分之九十仍是文盲。所以时常用指印来代替签名。
    维得金·古里巴利
    （世界拥护和平大会常设委员会所接到的一些来自非洲的公报上，常常看到斯德哥尔摩宣言下面盖着许多的全家指印：父亲用姆指捺指印，母亲及孩子用食指捺指印，乳儿则捺小手印—“和平拥护者”月刊编者）
