　　Comrade Wang Zhenxue, Driver Who Created a Record of 200,000 Kilometers of Safe Driving

　　Comrade Wang Zhenxue is the driver of locomotive No. 1-102 in the Suihua Locomotive Depot of the Northeast Railway, and is only twenty-six years old this year. He entered the Suihua Locomotive Depot as a car cleaner in 1942 and has been working for nine years. He has always been responsible and hardworking. In 1947, he was promoted to driver and led the locomotive group No. 1-102. On October 9, 1949, he honorably joined the Communist Party of China. Thanks to his and his team's efforts, locomotive No. 1-102 had no accidents from September 3, 1947, to May 28, 1950, a full two years and nine months, creating the highest record of 200,000 kilometers of safe driving in the entire railway system.

　　Locomotive No. 1-102 used to be a problematic locomotive with a chronic problem of overheating axles. On August 23, 1947, all the crew members were busy changing axle oil and forgot to detach the cars, causing an illegal operation accident, which erased more than 20,000 kilometers of safe driving. As a result, the crew members were a bit discouraged, saying, "It's really exhausting and unrewarding to take charge of this locomotive. It takes eighty kilograms of hard oil for one trip, and we still have accidents!" Wang Zhenxue and the instructing driver Zhang Guoqing studied solutions: on the one hand, they patiently promoted and encouraged the workers, advising them not to succumb to difficulties; on the other hand, they contacted the factory to repair the axles. In a few days, the axles were repaired, and the workers' morale rose again.

　　In order to improve the locomotive group and strive to eliminate accidents, Wang Zhenxue painstakingly studied and explored some methods:

　　First, clarify the division of labor and adhere to the system. He led the entire group to organize three teams: technology and operation, coal saving, and accident prevention. Each team elected a team leader, clarified the division of labor, and took responsibility separately. The technology and operation team leader was responsible for leading the entire group of workers to study technical management regulations, operation rules, and locomotive construction principles, using lectures, spot checks, and quizzes to improve everyone's knowledge. In addition to being responsible for leading the implementation of the three-shovel system, the coal saving team leader also divided the coal shoveling into large three-shovel, small three-shovel, tight three-shovel, and slow three-shovel according to the line conditions and combustion level. After shoveling the coal, water was sprinkled on the coal in time to prevent the coal from being sprayed out by the wind after being thrown into the firebox. They were also responsible for contacting the factory to repair any air leaks in a timely manner. In addition, they kept track of coal saving competitions, accurately calculated coal saving quantities, and summarized experiences. The accident prevention team leader was responsible for establishing an "alarm" record, recording all accident materials in order to review work and gain experience and lessons. Master the call and response system: after one person calls, the other two confirm and then respond. Lead the entire group to fully rest and restore physical strength during breaks. In addition, they were responsible for managing the shift handover system, where the outgoing driver would tell the incoming driver and assistant driver in detail about the locomotive's defects, check the axle lubrication points, friction surfaces, and oil film condition, and the incoming fireman would thoroughly check and tighten the soft grease plugs. When starting the train, all three people would jointly confirm the signals, and all three would confirm the received track warrant. Before the trip, guarantee conditions were set, and after returning to the depot, the conditions were reviewed. A locomotive status log was also established to record the status of each part of the locomotive and newly replaced parts to draw the attention of the entire group. He also created a tracing-to-the-root system: no matter how small the matter, the cause must be found in order to come up with accident prevention countermeasures.

　　Secondly, promote the spirit of class brotherhood and unite all the workers in the group. He said to Comrade Yang Weiju (a member of the Communist Party), "There are nine people in our locomotive group, and only the two of us are Party members. We must unite all the comrades in the group to ensure the completion of the task." Both of them were able to unite the workers in practical actions. For example, Zhou Chengli in their group was an old worker transferred from Harbin, with high skills and eleven years of driving experience. He got sick just two months after he transferred. The two of them often went to the hospital to see him and comfort him. Old Zhou had a large family and faced financial difficulties, so they launched a group to help. Comrade Zhao Shiqing was initially not serious enough in his work and could not complete his tasks thoroughly. Wang Zhenxue patiently educated him and helped him solve the difficulties in his work, improving his skills. In this way, Zhao Shiqing gradually improved.

　　In addition, Wang Zhenxue also used his rest time to frequently visit the homes of the workers in his group to understand their family situations; and he educated the workers' families to do more housework to reduce the labor of the male workers and allow them to complete their work tasks. If a worker had family problems, he would try to help solve them. In this way, the workers' families were also able to assist the whole group in doing their work well. At this celebration meeting, the workers' families also brought flowers.

　　The educational level of all nine people in their group was very low, so he worked hard to lead everyone in their studies. Now they can all read simple letters. He also taught the workers preliminary technical knowledge, so that the workers had a better understanding and were happy to work.

　　As a result, he led the entire group to safely drive 200,000 kilometers, completing and exceeding the task, creating a new record for the entire railway system, and saving a large amount of state property.

　　创造安全行走二十万公里纪录的
    司机长王振学同志
    王振学同志是东北铁路绥化机务段冖丂一—一○二号包车组司机长，今年才二十六岁。他在一九四二年考入绥化机务段当擦车工，到现在已经有了九年工龄。他工作一贯负责肯干。一九四七年他被提升为司机，领导一一○二号包车组。一九四九年十月九日，他光荣地参加了中国共产党。由于他和全组同志的努力，一一○二号机车从一九四七年九月三日到一九五○年五月二十八日，整整两年九个月没出事故，创造了安全行走二十万公里的全路最高纪录。
    一一○二号机车以前是一个不好的机车，有着大轴发热的老毛病。一九四七年八月二十三日，全班乘务员因为忙着换轴油，忘了甩车，造成违法运转事故，把两万多安全公里的成绩给勾消了。这样一来，乘务员都有点泄气，说：“包这台机车真是费劲不讨好，一趟车使八十公斤硬油，还得出事故！”王振学就和指导司机张国卿研究了办法：一面向工友们耐心地宣传鼓励，劝工友们不要向困难低头；一面向工厂联系，修理大轴。不几天，轴修好了；工友们的情绪才又高涨起来。
    王振学为了搞好包车组，争取消灭事故，就苦心钻研，摸索出一些方法：
    首先是明确分工，坚持制度。他领导全组组织起技行、节煤、防止事故三个小组，各组选出小组长，明确分工、分别负责：技行组长负责领导全组工友学习技术管理规程、运转细则、机车构造原理，利用讲课、抽查、试问等方式来提高大家。节煤组长除负责领导履行三锹制度外，再根据线路状态，燃烧程度分出大三锹、小三锹、紧三锹、慢三锹；上完煤后及时向煤上洒水，使煤投到火室内不再被风喷出。并且负责和工厂联系，发现漏气的地方时好及时修理。此外，还掌握节煤竞赛，精算节煤数量，总结经验。防止事故小组长负责设立“警报”记录，记载一切事故材料，以便检讨工作，取得经验教训。掌握呼唤应答制：先一人呼后，其余二人则加确认，再行应答。领导全组在休息时充分休息、恢复体力。此外还负责管理接交班制，就是交班司机将机车不良处，详细告诉接班司机和接班副司机，检查大轴给油处所、摩擦面及油膜状态，接班司炉彻底检查上好软干油堵；发车时三人共同确认号志，接到路票也由三人确认；出乘前定出保证条件，回段后按条件检讨。还建立机车状态簿，将机车各部状态各新换零件记在簿上，以便引起全组的注意。他又创造了一个追根制度：无论事情大小，必须找出原因，以便想出防止事故对策。
    其次，是发扬阶级友爱的精神，团结全组工友。他向司机杨维居同志（中共党员）说：“咱们包车组一共九个人，就咱两个是党员。咱们一定要好好团结全组同志，保证完成任务。”他们两个人都能在实际行动中来团结工友。例如他们组的周成礼是哈尔滨转来的老工友，技术很高，开过十一年车。刚转来两个月就有了病。他们两人就经常到医院去看他、安慰他。老周家里人口很多，生活困难，他们就发动小组解决。赵世清工友，起初工作不够严肃，不能彻底完成任务，王振学就耐心地教育他，帮助他解决工作中的困难，提高技术。这样，赵世清就渐渐进步了。
    此外，王振学又利用休息时间，经常到本组工友家中进行访问，了解工友们的家庭情况；并且教育工友家属们多作家务工作，以减轻男工友的劳动，让他们完成工作任务。工友如果有家庭问题，他就设法帮助解决。这样，就使工友家属们也都能协助全组搞好工作。这次庆功会上，工友家属还都带上了花。
    他们全组九个人文化水平都很低，他就努力领导大家学习。现在他们都能看简单的书信了。他又教工友们初步技术知识，使工友们心里有了底，干活就高兴了。
    由于这样，他领导全组安全行走二十万公里，完成并超过了任务，创造了全路最高新纪录，为国家节省了大批的资财。
