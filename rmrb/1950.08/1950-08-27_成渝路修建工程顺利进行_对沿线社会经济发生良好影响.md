　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 25th: The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway construction project is progressing smoothly. The section from Jiulongpo to Dadukou in Chongqing started track laying on August 1st. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the Chongqing to Zhuyangxi (under the jurisdiction of Jiangjin County) section will be open to traffic. As of the end of July, nearly 100,000 standard workdays (calculated at eight hours per day) had been completed, accounting for approximately 6.5% to 15% of the total earth and stone works required for this section. The Southwest Military Region troops participating in the road construction demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm during the project. They overcame various difficulties in tools and technology, and continuously improved the efficiency of road construction work. In June, when the project first started, the work efficiency of ordinary soldiers could only reach 40% to 50% of the standard workday efficiency. By July, it had generally increased to 80%, and a few units had even increased to 90%.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, August 25th: The commencement of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has begun to have a positive impact on the socio-economic life of Chongqing and other areas along the railway line. Industries in Chongqing, such as steel, machinery, and cement, which had been in serious difficulty, have now fully or partially resumed production due to orders from the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. More than 100 private machinery factories in the city had almost completely shut down since March and April of this year, but since the construction of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway began in June, they have received initial orders sufficient for three to four months, or even half a year, of production. The cement industry received orders for 30,000 barrels of cement. Four state-owned steel plants and one private steel plant have resumed production, and some factories are actively expanding their equipment. The Southwest Industrial Department is also expanding steelmaking equipment in Qijiang County, a iron ore producing area, to increase steel production capacity. In addition to some unemployed workers in Chongqing being re-employed due to the resumption of factory production, Chongqing and other regions are mobilizing 20,000 unemployed workers to work on the railway. At the same time, the rural economy in the Sichuan Basin is gradually becoming more active. In the harvesting and transportation of a large number of sleepers required for the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway, hundreds of thousands of farmers in about 70 counties under the jurisdiction of the eastern Sichuan, western Sichuan, and southern Sichuan administrative regions have increased their income; 7,000 farmers in Qijiang County in southern Sichuan have survived the summer famine by transporting sleepers.

　　成渝路修建工程顺利进行
    对沿线社会经济发生良好影响
    【新华社重庆二十五日电】成渝铁路修建工程，正顺利地进行着。重庆九龙坡至大渡口一段线路，已于八月一日起开始铺轨。预计于今年底通车的重庆至朱阳溪（江津县属）段内，截至七月底止，已将近作了十万个标准工（以每天八小时计算），约占该段全部土石方工程用工数量的百分之六点五至百分之十五。参加筑路的西南军区部队，在工程中表现了高度的劳动热情。他们战胜了工具和技术上的各种困难，不断地提高筑路的工作效率。六月间工程刚开始时，一般战士的工作效率每工只能达到标准工效率的百分之四十至五十，至七月份则已普遍提高到百分之八十，少数单位更提高到百分之九十。
    【新华社重庆二十五日电】成渝铁路的开工已在重庆和铁路沿线各地的社会经济生活中，开始发生良好影响。曾陷于严重困难的重庆钢铁、机械、水泥等工业，现已因成渝铁路的定货而全部或部分地复工生产。全市一百多家私营机械工厂自今年三、四月间起即已几乎全部停工，但自六月成渝路开始修建后，它们已得到足可生产三、四个月甚至半年的第一批定货。水泥业则得到三万桶水泥的定货。钢铁业已有四家国营钢铁厂和一家私营钢铁厂复工，有的厂并在积极扩充设备中。西南工业部更在铁矿产区綦江县扩大炼钢设备，以提高钢铁生产能力。失业工人除重庆已有一部分因工厂恢复生产而复业外，重庆市和各地正在动员两万失业工人到铁路上工作。与此同时，四川盆地农村经济亦逐渐趋向活跃。在参加采伐和运输成渝路所需的大批枕木中，川东、川西、川南三行政区所属约七十个县有数十万农民增加了收入；川南綦江县七千农民即因运送枕木而度过了夏荒。
