Xinhua News Agency, 15th. Today, five years after Japan's surrender, MacArthur, the head of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan, and his loyal lackey, the Yoshida government, are continuing to violate the Potsdam Declaration's provisions for encouraging Japanese democratic forces, and are intensifying their suppression and persecution of Japanese democratic forces, led by the Japanese Communist Party. The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are intensifying their illegal persecution of JCP Central Committee members, led by Tokuda Kyuichi and Nosaka Sanzo, with new fabrications. In early July, the Yoshida government's Special Examination Bureau of the Ministry of Justice, using fabricated "reasons," illegally summoned Shiga Yoshio, Kurahara Koreto, and others in an attempt to frame them. Subsequently, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries dispatched 25,000 police officers and a large number of secret agents to conduct a nationwide search and arrest of nine JCP leaders. Police detectives abused search warrants, arbitrarily detaining people who resembled JCP leaders, and illegally entered private residences.

Local organizations of the Japanese Communist Party have also suffered similar persecution, frequently subjected to illegal police searches and even dissolution. On July 21, the JCP Tokyo Shinsha Ward Committee and the "Dainippon" Printing Company branch were illegally dissolved by the Special Examination Bureau, and eighteen leading workers of these two organizations were illegally "purged."

The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are attempting to intensify the suppression of the Japanese patriotic democratic movement through the persecution of the JCP.

In the recent frantic attack by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries against democratic forces, progressive public opinion is one of the main targets. The Japanese people's mouthpiece, the JCP Central Committee's organ, Akahata (Red Flag) newspaper, was first unreasonably ordered to suspend publication for thirty days on June 26, and then illegally ordered to be permanently shut down on July 18. A large number of progressive newspapers and periodicals distributed throughout Japan have also been illegally shut down. According to an announcement by the Ministry of Justice on August 5, a total of 1,212 progressive newspapers and periodicals have been closed down based on MacArthur's instructions. These include the organ of the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council, Rodo Shimbun (Labor News), and the Shin Bunka (New Culture) newspaper published by the Japan Democratic Culture League. While closing down newspapers and periodicals, the police and secret agents took the opportunity to conduct large-scale illegal searches of these local organizations.

Not only that, but MacArthur also instructed Japanese reactionary news agencies to persecute progressive journalists by means of "dismissal." The "dismissal" measures began at the Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, and other newspapers in Tokyo, as well as news agencies such as the Japan Broadcasting Corporation, Jiji Press, and Kyodo News. On July 28 alone, more than 300 people were "dismissed" simultaneously. Subsequently, newspapers in Osaka, Kyoto, and even Hakodate in Hokkaido adopted the same persecution measures, and a large number of Communist Party members and other democratic elements engaged in journalism were subjected to unwarranted "dismissals." According to Kyodo News, as of August 7, the number of those "dismissed" had reached 645.

The persecution of the Japanese press by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is only part of a larger conspiracy by the reactionaries to persecute the Japanese patriotic democratic movement, especially the labor movement. Justice Minister Takeo Ohashi stated on the 2nd that the Yoshida "government will unhesitatingly support the plan to expel Communists and their fellow travelers from transportation, electricity, and other public utilities." The authorities of "Japan Transmission and Distribution Electricity" Corporation, after consultation with MacArthur Headquarters and the Yoshida government authorities, have decided to dismiss more than 2,000 progressive employees from the company. The Kyushu branch of the All-Japan Electrical Workers' Union has ordered its members to register, with the aim of persecuting progressive workers.

The frenzied suppression and persecution of Japanese democratic forces by the U.S. imperialists and their Japanese lackeys exposes their fear of the growing Japanese democratic forces. They are attempting to use these fascist terror tactics to pave the way for their actions to further drag Japan into an aggressive adventure. However, under the opposition of the patriotic Japanese people, the conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are doomed to fail.

### 美日反动派违背波茨坦宣言  加紧迫害日本民主力量  力图以法西斯手段把日本拖入侵略冒险

　　美日反动派违背波茨坦宣言
    加紧迫害日本民主力量
    力图以法西斯手段把日本拖入侵略冒险
    【新华社十五日讯】在这日本投降五年后的今天，美国驻日本占领军首脑麦克阿瑟及其忠实走狗吉田政府，正继续违背波茨坦宣言关于鼓励日本民主势力的规定，变本加厉地镇压与迫害以日本共产党为首的日本民主力量。美、日反动派正以新的捏造，加紧对以德田球一、野坂参三为首的日共中央委员们的非法迫害。七月初，吉田政府法务府特别审查局以捏造的“理由”，先后非法传讯了志贺义雄、藏原惟人等人，企图加以陷害。接着，美、日反动派即出动了警察二万五千名及大批特务，在全国范围内进行搜捕九名日共领袖。警探更滥用搜捕令，随意拘留貌似日共领袖的人，并擅自进入私人住宅。
    日本共产党的地方组织也遭受到类似的迫害，时常被警察非法搜查，甚至解散。七月二十一日，日共东京新舍区委员会及“大日本”印刷公司支部就被特别审查局非法解散，这两个组织的十八名领导工作者并被非法“整肃”。
    美、日反动派企图经过对日共的迫害来加紧对日本爱国民主运动的镇压。
    在美、日反动派最近对民主力量的疯狂进攻中，进步舆论是主要的对象之一。日本人民的喉舌——日共中央机关报赤旗报首先于六月二十六日被无理勒令停刊三十天，随即于七月十八日被非法命令永久停刊。分布于全日各地的进步报刊，也大量地被非法封闭。据法务府八月五日宣布，根据麦克阿瑟的指令而封闭的进步报刊，共达一千二百十二家。其中包括全日工会联络协议会的机关报劳动新闻，以及日本民主主义文化联盟出版的新文化报。在与封闭报刊的同时，警察及特务并乘机对这些地方组织大规模地进行非法搜查。
    不仅如此，麦克阿瑟并指使日本各反动新闻机关当局，以“解雇”为手段，迫害进步的新闻工作者。“解雇”措施开始于东京的朝日新闻、每日新闻等报馆，以及日本广播协会、时事通讯社、共同通讯社等新闻机关。在七月二十八日一天中，就有三百余人同时被“解雇”。接着，大阪、京都以至北海道的函馆各地的报馆，都相继采取同一迫害措施，大批从事新闻工作的共产党员及其他民主分子遭受到无理“解雇”。据共同社报道，截至八月七日止，被“解雇”者已达六百四十五名。
    美、日反动派对日本新闻界的迫害，不过是反动派大规模迫害日本爱国民主运动特别是职工运动的阴谋计划的一部分。法务府总裁大桥武夫二日声称：吉田“政府将毫不迟疑地支持在交通、电气及其他公用事业中，驱逐共产党及其同路人的计划”。“日本发送电”公司当局与麦克阿瑟总部及吉田政府当局会商后，已决定自该公司开除二千余名进步职工。全日电气工人工会九州分会，已命令会员登记，目的在迫害进步工人。
    美帝国主义者及其日本走狗对日本民主力量疯狂的镇压与迫害，暴露出它们对日益壮大的日本民主力量的恐惧。它们力图以这种法西斯的恐怖手段，来为它们把日本进一步拖入侵略冒险的行为，开辟道路。但是，在日本爱国人民的反对下，美、日反动派的阴谋，是注定要失败的。
