Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd. Soong Ching Ling, founder and director of the China Welfare Fund, announced that the China Welfare Fund would be renamed the China Welfare Institute from August 15th, given that China now belongs to the people, and work can be carried out in all aspects with higher standards, and in a planned and efficient manner. She announced that due to the change of the name, the mission of the institute has also changed. The China Welfare Fund was founded in 1938, named the China Defense League, which was a temporary organization, and its mission was to assist the war of resistance. After 1945, during the period of post-war recovery, it was renamed the China Welfare Fund, and its activities covered medicine, women and children's welfare, education, culture, and other aspects. Today, after being renamed the China Welfare Institute, it will become a permanent organization, and its mission will be in the areas of medical services, women and children's welfare, and cultural education. The main purpose of the China Welfare Institute is to establish demonstrative and experimental work. To accomplish this goal, work and technical standards must be established in order to engage in research work. The results of the work will be disseminated throughout the country through government agencies and people's organizations engaging in the same activities. Another working purpose of the China Welfare Institute is to spread the news of itself, the China People's Relief Administration, and other welfare and relief organizations to the world. In this respect, it is a continuation and expansion of part of its past work. In the past twelve years, the China Welfare Fund has reported to the world the Chinese people's struggle against imperialist aggression and against domestic fascism. The general headquarters of the China Welfare Institute is still located in Shanghai.
