    The Struggle in the Security Council
    Currently, a tense struggle between two lines is unfolding within the United Nations Security Council regarding the Korean issue. One line, adopted by the Soviet representative, is to stop the war of aggression and defend world peace; the other line, adopted by the representatives of the United States and its puppet states, is to expand the war of aggression and undermine world peace.
    Since January of this year, when American imperialism, manipulating the majority in the Security Council, unreasonably refused to allow the Central People's Government of China to send a representative to the Security Council, the Soviet representative, in order to defend the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and the legitimate composition of the United Nations organization, to protest the illegal actions of the imperialist bloc, withdrew from the Security Council meetings and solemnly declared that all resolutions passed by the Security Council without the participation of the representatives of the Soviet Union and China, the two permanent members, were illegal. This solemn action by the Soviet Union powerfully exposed the ugly face of the imperialist bloc in undermining the United Nations before the people of the world.
    However, since June of this year, American imperialism has brazenly disregarded the illegal state of the Security Council, using it to illegally pass resolutions as a fig leaf for its war of aggression against Korea. Under these circumstances, the Soviet representative Malik notified the UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on July 27 that he would legally take over as Chairman of the Security Council in August in order to wage a struggle within the Security Council and further strike at the aggressive schemes of American imperialism.
    In the successive meetings of the Security Council since the beginning of this month, Malik has excellently carried out this struggle and dealt a heavy blow to the aggressive schemes of American imperialism. On August 1, Malik, in his capacity as chairman, ruled that the Kuomintang representative was illegal, and proposed that the representation of the Central People's Government of China in the Security Council be the first item on the agenda, and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue be the second item. However, this just ruling and agenda were unreasonably vetoed by the United States using its majority. This exposed the sinister attempt of American imperialism to insist on the war of aggression against Korea and to continue to use the Security Council as its tool of aggression. On August 4, Malik again proposed a "Plan for the Peaceful Settlement of the Korean Issue," and argued that: (1) The Security Council must invite representatives of the People's Republic of China and hear the opinions of the representatives of the Korean people when discussing the Korean issue. (2) Stop the hostilities in Korea and withdraw foreign troops from Korea at the same time. In contrast, the United States, which had been panicked and uneasy since the Soviet Union announced its return to the Security Council, put forward the so-called "Accusation of North Korea's Aggression against the Republic of Korea." The above facts fully demonstrate that the Soviet Union is resolutely implementing a policy of defending the United Nations and defending world peace, while the United States is continuing to implement a policy of using the Security Council as a tool for its aggression against Korea, thereby expanding the war. Therefore, even though the United States repeatedly manipulates the voting machine and obstructs the passage of Soviet proposals in every possible way in the Security Council, the Soviet Union's policy of peace has won the cheers of the people all over the world, making the bellicose American imperialist bloc increasingly isolated.
    The Soviet Union's struggle in the Security Council has also disrupted the deployment of aggression by American imperialism. The original plan of the United States to expand its war activities by coercing the illegal Security Council has been greatly restricted, and it feels embarrassed. In the situation where the United States is repeatedly defeated in Korea and the Soviet Union insists on a policy of peace, signs of increasing contradictions have appeared within the imperialist camp.
    New Situation in the Korean War
    The Korean War is entering a new phase. The heroic and battle-tested Korean People's Army, after overcoming numerous difficulties and defeating the stubborn resistance of constantly reinforcing enemy forces, is continuing its victorious advance, liberating most of southern Korea, and has driven the American aggressors to the southeastern corner of the Korean peninsula. Under the powerful blows of the Korean People's Army, Walker, the commander of the US forces in Korea, who ordered "no retreat" on July 29, had to withdraw his order and began on August 1 to withdraw his troops across the east bank of the Nakdong River, attempting to rely on this so-called "insurmountable natural barrier," and the relatively concentrated forces after "shortening the front," to stubbornly resist in the bridgehead positions around Busan, and "hold out for reinforcements." In the face of such repeated defeats of the US invading forces, even some American invaders are lamenting that "the US military will be driven into the sea."
    However, the American aggressors have not given up. On the one hand, they are continuing to send troops and generals, and are coercing the governments of their puppet states to send troops to Korea in an attempt to salvage the situation. On the other hand, the American aggressors are further expanding their crimes. The US military is implementing a cruel scorched-earth policy in its war zone, and is frantically bombing the peaceful cities and transportation of the Korean people, attempting to increase the difficulty of the People's Army's advance, and at the same time creating a so-called "security zone" of no-man's-land within twenty miles behind the US military front line.
    These frantic, barbaric, and shameless struggling actions of the American aggressors will undoubtedly increase the difficulties of the Korean people, and force the Korean people to prepare for a difficult and protracted struggle. However, the Korean people are bound to win, because what the Korean people are waging is a just war of liberation; the American aggressors are bound to fail, because what the American aggressors are waging is an unjust and anti-people war.
    America’s “Lone Struggle”
    So far, the US Army is still “struggling alone” on the Korean battlefield. The United States easily drove various countries in the Security Council to vote in favor of the decision to invade Korea, obtaining the support of a small number of naval and air forces from countries such as Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands. However, when the ruling groups of puppet states such as Britain, France, and Australia saw the American aggressors suffering heavy losses in Korea, they became very panicked and shaken. Britain said: "The burden of the war in Malaya does not allow Britain to send troops to Korea"; France said: "The war in Vietnam is heavy enough for France"; the Netherlands also said that it was impossible to send troops...
    Under the strong pressure of the United States threatening to reduce "Marshall Plan aid," the British government had to agree in late July to send 3,500 to 4,000 troops to Korea, and the governments of Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Nicaragua, Turkey, and other countries also agreed to send thousands of troops one after another. On August 7, the American puppet Quirino of the Philippines also changed his previous decision not to send troops after holding secret talks with the American senior military advisor Hopes. Canadian Prime Minister Laurent also announced on the same day his decision to organize troops to participate in the American war of aggression in Korea.
    Nevertheless, only a few countries have so far agreed to send troops (including "symbolic" troops) to serve as cannon fodder for American imperialism, and the governments of these countries are still using various excuses to delay the timing of sending troops. Dozens of countries such as France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, and Norway still openly refuse to send ground troops, and are only willing to provide some material and medical "aid."
    In this way, nearly a month after the United States used Lie to make a request for troops, there is still not a single soldier from any other country's army in Korea for the United States to drive. Therefore, the war of aggression waged by the American aggressors in Korea under the name of the "United Nations" is still the adventure of the United States alone.

    安理会的斗争
    围绕着朝鲜问题，目前联合国安全理事会内正展开着紧张的两条路线的斗争。一条路线是苏联代表所采取的，这就是制止侵略战争与保卫世界和平的路线：另一条路线是美国及其仆从国家政府的代表所采取的，这就是扩大侵略战争与破坏世界和平的路线。
    自从今年一月，美帝国主义在安理会内操纵多数无理拒绝我国中央人民政府派遣代表出席安理会以后，苏联代表为了保卫联合国宪章的宗旨、原则和联合国组织的合法组成，为了抗议帝国主义集团的非法行动，曾退出安理会会议，并严正宣布安理会在苏、中两常任理事国代表没有参加的情形下所通过的一切决议，均属非法。苏联的这一严正行动，曾在全世界人民面前有力地揭露了帝国主义集团破坏联合国的丑恶面目。
    但是，自从今年六月以来，美帝国主义竟悍然不顾安理会所处的非法状态，利用安理会非法通过决议，作为其对朝鲜进行侵略战争的遮羞布。在这种形势下，苏联代表马立克乃于七月二十七日通知联合国秘书长赖伊于八月份依法轮值，担任安理会主席，以便在安理会内部进行斗争，进一步打击美帝国主义的侵略阴谋。
    在本月开始以来的安理会历次会议上，马立克卓越地进行了这一斗争，并给了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋以沉重打击。八月一日，马立克以主席地位裁决国民党代表为非法，提出以中国中央人民政府为中国在安理会代表为第一项议程，以和平解决朝鲜问题为第二项议程。但是这一正义的裁决和议程，却为美国利用多数无理否决。这就暴露了美帝国主义坚持对朝鲜的侵略战争，和继续利用安理会为其侵略工具的阴险企图。八月四日，马立克又提出“和平解决朝鲜问题案”，并主张：（一）安理会必须邀请中华人民共和国代表，并在讨论朝鲜问题时，听取朝鲜人民代表陈述意见。（二）停止朝鲜境内战事，并同时自朝鲜撤出外国军队。与此相反，自从苏联宣布重新参加安理会时即感到恐慌不安的美国，却提出了所谓“控诉北朝鲜侵略大韩民国案”。以上事实充分表明了：苏联坚决执行保卫联合国，保卫世界和平的政策，而美国却继续执行利用安理会为其侵略朝鲜的工具，从而扩大战争的政策。因此，纵然在安理会上，美国一再操纵表决机器，百般阻挠苏联提案的通过，但是苏联的和平政策已经获得了全世界人民的欢呼，而使好战的美帝国主义集团愈益陷于孤立。
    苏联在安理会内的斗争也有力地打乱了美帝国主义的侵略部署。美国原先以挟持非法的安理会以扩大其战争活动的计划，已受到极大的限制，因而感到狼狈周章。在美国在朝鲜连战连败与苏联坚持和平政策的情形下，帝国主义阵营内部已呈现矛盾日益增加的迹象。
    朝鲜战争的新局势
    朝鲜战争正在进入一个新的局面。英勇善战的朝鲜人民军，在克服重重困难，击溃不断增援的敌军的顽抗以后，正继续胜利进军，解放了南部朝鲜的绝大部分土地，并已把美国侵略者赶至朝鲜半岛的东南一隅。在朝鲜人民军的强大打击下，于七月二十九日下令“不再后退”的朝鲜美军司令瓦克，已不得不收回成命，而于八月一日开始将其部队撤过洛东江东岸，企图凭借这所谓“不可超越的天险”，和经过“缩短战线”后相对集中的兵力，在釜山周围的桥头阵地，负隅顽抗，“固守待援”。在美国侵略军这种连战连败的情况下，就连美国的一些侵略分子也在哀鸣“美军将被赶下海了”。
    但是，美国侵略者决未死心，目前一方面正在继续调兵遣将，并胁迫其仆从国家政府出兵朝鲜，以图挽救残局；另一方面，美国侵略者正进一步扩大其罪行。美军在其战区内实行残酷的烧光杀光政策，并狂炸朝鲜人民的和平城市和交通，企图增加人民军前进的困难，同时并在美军前线后方二十英里以内造成所谓“安全地带”的无人区。
    美国侵略者这种疯狂、野蛮而无耻的挣扎性行动，这无疑会增加朝鲜人民的困难，使朝鲜人民不能不准备艰苦的和持久的斗争。但是，朝鲜人民一定要胜利，因为朝鲜人民所进行的，是正义的解放战争；美国侵略者一定要失败，因为美国侵略者所进行的，是非正义的反人民的战争。
    美国“孤军奋斗”
    截至目前为止，美国陆军仍在朝鲜战场上“孤军奋斗”。美国曾轻易地驱使各国在安理会中投票赞成侵略朝鲜的决定，取得英、法、澳、新西兰、荷兰等国的少数海空军的支持。但当英、法、澳等仆从国家的统治集团看到美国侵略者在朝鲜碰得头破血流时，便非常慌张和动摇起来。英国说：“马来亚的战事负担不允许英国分兵朝鲜”；法国说：“越南的战事对法国已够沉重”；荷兰也说不可能出兵……。
    在美国以削减“马歇尔计划援助”为威胁的强硬压力下，英国政府不得不于七月下旬答应出兵三千五百人至四千人至朝鲜，澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国、尼加拉瓜、土耳其等国政府亦先后答应出兵数千。八月七日，美国的菲律宾傀儡季里诺在和美国高级军事顾问霍普斯举行密谈后，也改变了其以前不出兵的决定。加拿大总理劳伦特亦于同日宣布决定组织军队到朝鲜参加美国的侵略战争。
    虽然如此，但至今答应出兵（包括“象征性”军队）为美帝国主义充当炮灰的，仍然只有少数国家，而且这些国家的政府对出兵的时间，仍在以各种托辞实行拖延。而法、荷、比、丹、挪等数十国家，仍公开拒绝出动地面部队，仅愿提供若干物资和医药“援助”。
    这样，美国在利用赖伊提出出兵要求将近一个月的今天，尚无其他任何国家的陆军的一兵一卒在朝鲜供美国驱策。因此，美国侵略者盗用“联合国”名义在朝鲜进行的侵略战争，还是美国一国的冒险。
