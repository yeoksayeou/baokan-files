　　My Opinion on Hail Prevention
　　Liu Shanben
    The People's Daily published an article titled "Man Will Conquer Nature" on June 13th, introducing the experience of the Second District of Wuxiang in overcoming hail disasters. This experience of using cannons to destroy hail is difficult to explain scientifically.

    According to my understanding, hailstones are formed due to strong updrafts. Water droplets in clouds are pushed upwards by updrafts, and they freeze when they exceed the freezing line. When the upward force is insufficient or encounters a downdraft, the initially formed hail falls below the freezing line and picks up moisture. If it encounters another updraft and is pushed above the freezing line again, the external moisture freezes again. Thus, it grows larger each time. The layered shape of hailstones when cut open is proof of their formation process. When the updraft can no longer counteract its weight, it falls. This is what causes hail.

    Why are there strong updrafts? This is due to solar radiation and the nature of the ground. The sun's heat energy radiates to the ground, and the ground's temperature rises. The temperature rises faster and higher, especially on sandy and rocky ground. The layer of air close to the ground is heated by the ground, its temperature rises, its density decreases, and it rises. If the atmosphere is in an unstable state, it promotes this upward movement of air. If the air is not too dry, it will form thunderstorms or hailstorms. This is what is called a local thunderstorm. Hailstorms mostly occur in these thunderstorms. Hail may also occur in cold front thunderstorms, which depends on the speed of the cold front, the humidity of the air, and the unstable state of the warm air. The latter is more decisive. The unstable state of the atmosphere is directly or indirectly caused by solar radiation and ground conditions. There are no thunderstorms or hailstorms in winter because the sun shines obliquely in winter and the ground is not heated much. In summer, the ground in Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) receives a lot of solar radiation, and the air humidity is also very high. But why is it rarely heard that rice in the Jiangzhe area (Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces) suffers from hail disasters? This is because the Jiangzhe area has crisscrossing rivers and rice paddies, the ground is humid, and there is a lot of water and grass. When exposed to solar radiation, the water evaporates and absorbs heat, the ground temperature does not increase much, the updraft is not strong, and the atmosphere is relatively stable, making it less prone to hailstorms. Conversely, in the North China and Northwest China areas, there is more sandy land, and the ground has a smaller specific heat capacity, so the temperature easily becomes high when heated. Therefore, there are more thunderstorms and hailstorms in spring and summer. By summer and autumn, they gradually decrease or disappear completely because these areas have a rainy season in summer and autumn, the ground is moist, the vegetation is lush, and the atmosphere is relatively stable.

    As for bombing hailstones, it is neither a fundamental cure—eliminating the cause of hailstones to stabilize the atmosphere—nor can it treat the symptoms, as it is impossible to use the heat of artillery fire to melt all or a significant portion of the hailstones. Even if the artillery fire is continuous and does generate a lot of heat, how much can it increase the temperature of an area? Moreover, the time it takes for hailstones to pass through the lower atmosphere is very short, so the amount of melting will be very small. If the power of the artillery fire is very large, theoretically speaking, the upward force of the gas emitted by the artillery fire will only increase the updraft, making the atmosphere more unstable and further promoting the growth of hailstones, and it will certainly not eliminate hail disasters. Even if the artillery fire is strong enough to push the hailstones high enough to prevent them from falling in this area, they will still fall in another area. This is not eliminating hail, but driving hail, which is worse than driving locusts. In fact, this small amount of artillery firepower is very weak to nature and has no impact on hail disasters. But why do some people still believe it? This is because hailstorms occur in thunderclouds and showers, and they pass quickly. No one has ever seen hailstones falling for several hours in a row. If hailstones fell like drizzle for several days, people would immediately test the effect of artillery fire on hailstones. Moreover, the area affected by hailstones is generally small, the so-called "hail hits a row." In many cases, only the leading edge of the thunderstorm has hailstones, and the majority of the thunderstorm behind it does not. Therefore, in the same area that a thunderstorm passes through, some parts do not have hailstones, so if artillery fire is used, it will not have any effect. While it is possible to recognize clouds with hailstones (gray-green tower-shaped cumulonimbus clouds are a symbol that there are hailstones inside), it is difficult to say specifically how large the hailstones are here, whether they are the size of eggs or peas. If pea-sized hailstones fall, artillery fire will not reduce them much.

    Is "Man Will Conquer Nature" correct? Of course, it is correct. Hail disasters can certainly be overcome, but the method of overcoming hail disasters is not simply firing cannons, but a long-term and arduous task. That is to widely carry out tree planting, cultivate forests, open canals, dig wells, irrigate fields, and turn barren beaches and rocks into forests and grasslands, and dry land full of loess into green fields. Transforming the nature of the ground in this way can reduce updrafts, make the atmosphere more stable, and achieve the goal of eliminating hail disasters.

### 我对于防雹的意见

　　我对于防雹的意见
　　刘善本
    六月十三日人民日报第二版载《人定胜天》一文，介绍武乡二区战胜雹灾的经验。这种用炮灭雹的经验在科学上很难讲通。
    按冰雹乃是由于剧烈的上升气流造成的。云里的水点被上升气流推上，超过冰线时则结成冰。上升力不足时或遇下降气流，这个最初形成的冰雹下降在冰线下沾上水份，遇到另一股上升气流再推上超过冰线，外部水份又结成冰：于是一次比一次增大。冰雹割开呈现一层一层的形状，就是它的形成过程的证明。等到上升气流不能抵消它的重量时，它就落下。这就是下雹子。
    为什么会有剧烈的上升气流呢？这是由于太阳的辐射热和地面的性质造成的。太阳的热能辐射到地面，地面受热温度增高，特别在沙土岩石地上温度增高得更快、更高。接近地面的一层空气，受着地面的热力，温度增高，密度减小而上升。如果大气是在不稳定状态，就助长了这种空气的上升；如果空气不太干燥，就会形成雷雨或带冰雹。这就是所谓地方性雷雨。冰雹大都发生在这种雷雨里。在寒冷前线的雷雨里也可能有冰雹，这要依寒冷前线行进的速度、空气的湿度和暖空气的不稳定状态来决定。后者是更有决定性的。大气的不稳定状态还是直接间接由于太阳的辐射热和地面性质造成的。在冬季没有雷雨，也没冰雹。这就是因为冬季太阳斜射，地面受热不大。在夏季的江南地面受太阳的辐射热量很大，空气的湿度也很大，但是为什么很少听说江浙一带稻子受雹灾呢？这是因为江浙一带河流纵横，水田棋布，地面潮湿，多水多草，受到太阳辐射热，水份蒸发，吸收热量，地面温度增高不大，造成上升气流不厉害，大气较稳定，不容易发生雹灾。相反地，在华北西北一带多沙土地，地面比热较小，受热时温度易高，故在春夏间多雷雨雹灾。等到夏秋间渐减少，或完全没有雹灾。因为这些地区夏秋为雨季，地面潮润，草木也茂盛，大气较为稳定。
    至于炮轰冰雹既非治本——铲除造成冰雹的原因使大气稳定。也不能治标，即不可能用像炮火的热力使全部或相当大的一部分的冰雹融化。即使炮火连天，确能发出不少热量，可是对一块地区的气温能增加多少呢？何况冰雹经过低层空气的时间很短，所增加的融化量就会很小。如果炮火的威力很大，就理论上讲，炮火射击所发出气体的上升力只有增加上升气流，使大气更不稳定，更助长冰雹的增长，肯定不会消灭雹灾。即令炮火很够猛烈，能够把冰雹推高不在这块地区降落，但是还会落到别个地区，这不是灭雹，而是赶雹，这比赶蝗还坏。事实上这一点的炮火力量对自然界来讲，是很微弱的，对于雹灾是起不了什么影响的。但是为什么还有人相信呢？这是因为冰雹都是发生在雷云阵雨里，一会就会过去。谁也没有见过连着几小时的下雹子。如果下雹子像下毛毛雨那样一连几天的话，人们一次就会试验出炮打冰雹的效果来。而且下雹子的区域一般不大，所谓“雹打一溜”。很多时候仅雷雨行进的前缘有冰雹，雷雨后面的大半部就没有冰雹。所以在同一个雷雨经过地区，有些部分就没有冰雹，炮打了固然没有，不打也会没有。有冰雹的云固然是可以认识的（灰绿色的塔状的积雨云，是里面有冰雹的象征），可是具体的这里有多大的冰雹，是鸡蛋大的，还是豌豆大的？就很难说。如果是豌豆大的雹子落下来，炮打了也不会有什么减小。
    “人定胜天”是不是对呢？当然是对的，雹灾也是一定可以战胜的；不过战胜雹灾的方法不是简单的打炮，而是一个长期艰巨的工作。那就是广泛地进行植树，培植森林；开渠挖井，灌溉田地；把不毛的沙滩岩石变成树林草原，黄土满目的干地，变成绿油油的原野。这样改造地面的性质，才能减低上升气流，使大气比较稳定，达到消灭雹灾的目的。
