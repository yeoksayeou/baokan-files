Workers Take the Initiative to Overcome Shortcomings, Unite with Capitalists to Improve Business
Huabinyuan Bathhouse's Business Improves
[Our Newspaper] This city's Huabinyuan South Bathhouse, under the education and assistance of the Fourth District Federation of Trade Unions, has rectified the labor discipline of its employees and reformed the unreasonable wage system, resulting in improved business. The bathhouse has a total of seventy-four employees, divided into eleven departments including shaving, pedicure and back scrubbing, and the tea room. After the liberation of Beijing, the manager, Zu Hongkui, accommodated the workers in everything, always responding "Okay, okay, you decide" whenever workers made requests. The shaving workers' demand to change from a "40/60 split" (between worker and business) to a "50/50 split" meant the business was actually losing money. At that time, the workers' thinking was chaotic, labor discipline was generally poor, and there were even instances of embezzlement. Furthermore, the business paid for more than thirty sets of opera costumes, gongs and drums, and large flags, and regardless of whether it was a holiday or not, they would go out on stilts when they were happy, with the business covering the transportation and snack costs. The cost of the stilts troupe alone was enough to cover the bathhouse's coal expenses for half a year. Coupled with the capitalist's passive attitude towards management, business declined daily, and by last autumn, income had decreased significantly, with two instances of running out of coal and one instance of running out of food, almost leading to closure. Seeing this situation, the Fourth District Federation of Trade Unions actively strengthened the organization and education of the bathhouse's workers. After rectifying the organization, mobilizing learning, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, the workers' political awareness improved, and they recognized their position as masters in the new society. In particular, they realized that it was necessary to eliminate the lax style of work, strengthen labor discipline, and take the initiative to unite with the capitalists to overcome difficulties and strive for improved business. This lasted for more than four months and produced considerable results. For example, in September of last year, the bathhouse's trade union called for electricity conservation, and the monthly electricity consumption immediately dropped from 300 kWh to 170 kWh. However, the bathhouse's old wage system was extremely chaotic and unreasonable. The tea room workers' incomes differed by more than double depending on their work location, and some people did not earn a yuan for several days in a row, and were unlikely to receive a salary if they went to meetings or participated in learning. This unequal wage system seriously affected worker unity and the development of trade union work. In March of this year, representatives from each department formed a unified wage research committee under the leadership of the trade union. After repeated discussions and revisions by all employees, a reasonable unified wage system was established. However, Wang Xuezhang, the representative of the shaving workers' wage research committee, manipulated and controlled the committee, and used guild relations to force the shaving workers of Huabinyuan North Bathhouse, Defengyuan, and Qingxiangyuan to obstruct the implementation of the unified wage system that was being prepared in those bathhouses. In April, at a workers' congress, after a resolution was passed to expel Wang Xuezhang from the trade union membership, the workers' wages were reasonably adjusted, eliminating the phenomenon of unequal pay, the workers' labor discipline was gradually strengthened. After completing their own work, they repaired the roof that had not been repaired for more than a year, and also used the time after the lights went out every night to take turns doing voluntary work, painting the inside and outside of the building, a project that saved the bathhouse 6,000 jin of millet. The manager of the bathhouse, Zu Hongkui, and the business representative, Li Jiantang, greatly increased their confidence in management and proactively stored more than 100 tons of coal for three months and replaced all the old towels in the official hall with new ones.
Since the bathhouse improved its business, its comfortable facilities and attentive service have been praised by customers, and as a result, business has been improving day by day, and workers' incomes have also been increasing day by day. (Zhang Qisheng, Li Hong, Ban Shuyuan)

　　工人主动克服缺点团结资方改进业务
    华宾园澡堂营业好转
    【本报讯】本市华宾园南号澡堂在四区工会办事处教育及协助下，整顿职工劳动纪律，改革不合理的工资制度，营业已趋好转。该号职工共七十四名，分上活（理发）、下活（修脚搓背）、茶房等十一个部门。京市解放后，经理祖鸿魁，凡事迁就工人，每遇工人提出要求时，总是答复“好好好，你们瞧着办吧”。上活工人要求由“四六提成”改成为“五五提成”，实际资方是赔账。当时工人思想紊乱，一般劳动纪律很坏，尚有营私舞弊等现象。并由柜上出钱买了三十几套戏衣、锣鼓、大旗等，不论是否节日，高兴时便出去走高跷，还由柜上开车钱、点心钱。就只高跷会一项费用，足够该号半年烧煤费。更加以资方经营态度消极，于是营业日衰，到去年秋天，收入显著降低，有两次断煤，一次断粮，几乎歇业。四区工会办事处见此情形乃积极加强对该号工人的组织与教育工作。经过整顿组织、动员学习、开展批评与自我批评，工人政治觉悟提高，认识到自己在新社会中的主人翁地位，特别是目前必须革除散漫作风，加强劳动纪律，主动地团结资方克服困难，争取营业好转。前后历时四个多月，做出相当成绩。如去年九月该号工会号召节电，当月用电量即由每月三百度降为一百七十度。但该号旧工资制度极其紊乱而不合理，同样是茶房因工作地点不同，收入相差一倍多，且有人一连数天挣不到一元钱，外出开会或参加学习就可能分不到工资。这种苦乐不均的工资制度严重地影响了工人团结和工会工作的开展。至今年三月，该号各部门推出代表在工会领导下组成统一工资研究委员会，经全体职工多次讨论修改，规定了合理的统一工资制度，惟上活工人工资研究委员会代表王学章把持操纵，并利用行会关系强迫华宾园北号、德丰园、清香园各号上活工人阻挠实行各号正在酝酿中的统一工资制度。四月间职工大会，决议开除了王学章的工会会籍以后，工人工资得到了合理调整，消除了苦乐不均现象，工人劳动纪律日渐加强，并在本身工作完成后，将一年多未修之房顶修好，又利用每夜落灯后时间轮流做义务工，将房屋内外进行油漆粉刷，这项工程可为柜上节省小米六千斤。该号经理祖鸿魁及业务代表李健堂经营信心从此大为提高，主动地存储了三个月的用煤一百余吨，并将官堂旧毛巾一律换新。
    该号改进业务以来，设备舒适，招待殷勤，得到顾客赞赏，因之营业日趋好转，工人收入也日益增加。（张奇生、李宏、班淑媛）
