    Desertions from the Puppet "National Defense Guard" Increasing Daily
    [Xinhua News Agency, 25th] The Vietnamese People's Liberation Army is victoriously fighting in Central Vietnam and Northern Vietnam. According to a summary of Vietnam News Agency reports: In the period ending June 25, the Liberation Army engaged the French army five times in the Guangping Province of Central Vietnam, killing, wounding, and capturing 950 enemy soldiers. The French army was driven out of four important strongholds. The Liberation Army destroyed seven French military vehicles, seized 60 weapons of various calibers, liberated more than 100 civilians imprisoned by the enemy, and crushed the enemy's plan to destroy crops in Guangping Province.

    In Northern Vietnam, the Liberation Army attacked the French army in the Dongdu area north of Hanoi on July 15. Three weapons depots, two ammunition depots, one smoke bomb depot, and one oil depot containing 25,000 liters of gasoline and oil were destroyed. In addition, the Liberation Army burned 14 French military vehicles, destroyed 10 houses, killed 15 French soldiers, and wounded 10.

    Due to the continuous victories of the Liberation Army, an increasing number of soldiers conscripted into the "National Defense Guard" by the French army are defecting to the Vietnamese army. In July, more than 400 puppet soldiers defected in the Red River area.
