　　The Korean People's Just Struggle
    Introducing the "Photo Exhibition Commemorating the 5th Anniversary of the Liberation of the Korean People"
    [By Our Newspaper] The Foreign Cultural Liaison Bureau of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, in celebration of the anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, is holding the "Photo Exhibition Commemorating the 5th Anniversary of the Liberation of the Korean People" from August 15th to 31st in the back hall of the Sun Yat-sen Hall and the Water Pavilion in Zhongshan Park.
    The content of this exhibition mainly consists of photos of the construction of democratic Korea over the past five years and the liberation war waged by the Korean people against American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, with over a thousand photos of varying sizes and rich content. Among them are several photos of "General Kim Il-sung's Guerrilla Activities," "The Soviet Army's Dispatch of Troops and the Liberation of the Korean People," "Korean People's Leader General Kim Il-sung's Triumphant Return," and "General Kim Il-sung Leading the Great Cause of National Construction," and "Implementing Democratic Reforms."
    On August 9, 1945, the great Soviet Union, after defeating Hitler's Germany, declared war on Japanese imperialism in accordance with the Yalta Conference resolutions. Under the Soviet army's brave and fierce attack, Japan's so-called elite "Kwantung Army" was completely annihilated. On August 15th, Japan surrendered unconditionally. The Korean people were liberated from 36 years of colonial slavery. General Kim Il-sung returned in triumph and was elected Chairman of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea. On September 2, 1948, the Korean Supreme People's Assembly held its first session, announcing the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. On September 9th, the central government headed by General Kim Il-sung was formally established. We can see the process of the birth of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the photos.
    From the photos in the exhibition, we can also see the restoration and development of the people's economy in Korea over the past five years since liberation. Under the active assistance of the Soviet Union and the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the Korean people have spared no effort in building their motherland. The two one-year plans for 1947 and 1948 were successfully completed, and the people's two-year economic plan for 1949 to 1950 is also being successfully implemented.
    From the first day of liberation, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea thoroughly disintegrated the Japanese bandits' enslavement education system and established a democratic and patriotic education system. Compared with 1944, the number of primary schools in the northern half this year has increased by 2.94 times, junior high schools have increased by 2.124 times, and universities have increased by 3.75 times compared to 1946. The number of primary school students has increased by 170% compared to 1944, junior high school students have increased by 335%, and university students have increased by 510% compared to 1946. The construction of these cultural and educational undertakings can all be seen in the photos.
    Seeing the pictures about the liberation of Korean women makes people feel very excited. Korean women have been living inhuman lives due to the shackles and oppression of the feudal system and the colonial policy of Japanese imperialism for thousands of years. Since the Republic government implemented the "Law on Equal Rights for Men and Women," Korean women have enjoyed equal rights with men in political, economic, and cultural life.
    In addition, photos of the People's Army fiercely attacking the American army and the Syngman Rhee bandit army are also displayed in the Water Pavilion of Zhongshan Park. These are the photos that our Chinese people are most happy to see. Because these photos tell us that the Korean People's Army's fierce attack on American imperialists on their homeland is the most powerful means of defending world peace. These pictures include: the atrocities of the Syngman Rhee bandit army, the barbaric bombing by American imperialist aircraft, the heroic offensive of the Korean People's Army, the close cooperation between the Korean people and the People's Army, and the various embarrassing appearances of groups of captured American and Rhee soldiers.
    The photos in this exhibition were transported all the way from Korea by special train. This further enhances their intimacy.

　　朝鲜人民的正义斗争
    介绍“朝鲜人民解放五周年纪念图片展览会”
    【本报讯】中央人民政府文化部对外文化联络事务局，为庆祝朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国庆，于八月十五日起至三十一日止，假中山公园中山堂后厅及水榭举办“朝鲜人民解放五周年纪念图片展览会”。
    这次展览会的内容，以民主朝鲜五年来的建设与朝鲜人民为反对美帝国主义与李承晚卖国匪帮而进行的解放战争的图片为主，共有大小图片千余张，内容十分丰富。其中并有“金日成将军的游击活动”、“苏军的出兵与朝鲜人民的解放”、“朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军胜利归来”、“领导建国大业的金日成将军”、“实行民主改革”等照片多帧。
    一九四五年八月九日，伟大的苏联，在击溃希特勒德国以后，根据雅尔达会议的决议，对日本帝国主义宣战。在苏军的勇猛痛击下，日本的所谓精锐“关东军”全部被歼。八月十五日，日本无条件投降。朝鲜人民便从三十六年来的殖民地奴隶生活中获得了解放。金日成将军凯旋归来，并当选为北朝鲜临时人民委员会委员长。一九四八年九月二日，朝鲜最高人民会议召开第一次大会，在会上宣布了朝鲜民主主义共和国的成立。九月九日，以金日成将军为首的中央政府正式成立。我们在图片中可以看到朝鲜人民共和国从战斗中诞生的经过情形。
    从展览会的图片中，我们还可以看到朝鲜解放五年来人民经济的恢复与发展的情形。朝鲜人民在苏联的积极帮助和金日成将军的领导之下，对于祖国建设不遗余力。一九四七年与一九四八年两次一年计划都胜利完成，一九四九年至一九五○年的人民两年经济计划也正在胜利地执行着。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府从解放后的第一天起就彻底瓦解了日本强盗的奴化教育体系，建立了民主爱国的教育体系。今年北半部的小学数与一九四四年相比，增加了二·九四倍，初级中学增加了二·一二四倍，大学较一九四六年增加了三点七五倍。小学学生数目较一九四四年增加了百分之一七○，初级中学学生增加百分之三三五，而大学学生则较一九四六年增加了百分之五一○。这些文教事业建设的情形，都可以在图片中看到。
    看到关于解放后朝鲜妇女的图片，使人们感到非常兴奋，朝鲜妇女由于数千年来的封建制度和日本帝国主义的殖民地政策的束缚与压迫，一向过着非人的生活。自从共和国政府实施“男女平等权法令”后，朝鲜妇女，在政治、经济和文化生活上已与男子享有同等的权利。
    此外在中山公园水榭里还陈列有人民军痛击美国军队及李承晚匪军的照片。这是我们中国人民最高兴看到的照片。因为这些照片告诉我们：朝鲜人民军在国土上痛击美帝国主义者，正是最有力的保卫世界和平的手段。这些图片计有：李承晚匪军的暴行、美帝飞机的野蛮滥炸、朝鲜人民军的英勇进攻、朝鲜人民与人民军的密切合作以及成群的美李军俘虏的各种狼狈相。
    这次展览的图片，是从千里迢迢的朝鲜用专车运来的。这就更增加了他的亲切性。
