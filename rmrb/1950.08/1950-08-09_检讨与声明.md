　　Review and Statements
  Mr. Zhang Zongbing's Statement Regarding "Critique of 'Principles and Methods – A Summary of Michurin's Fifty Years of Work'"
    The book review published on July 12th contained Mr. Ye Duzhuang's critique of my translation of "Principles and Methods." I should humbly accept it, but there are a few points I should explain.
    (1) Errors in the book are unavoidable, and some typographical errors are especially inexcusable, such as "inter-genus" mistakenly written as "inter-tribe." The translation of "fruit tree variety" as "fruit seed" was because, during proofreading, I felt the title was too long and deleted the words "tree variety" without checking the original, thus causing the error. These all need to be corrected.
    (2) In addition, some translated names may be inappropriate, but all translated names in this book fully adopt the "Biological Nomenclature" of Ma Sai and Zheng Baoshan. Before a consensus is reached on translations, using the translated names from one book may be more consistent. Therefore, "tree crown" is translated as "corolla or top branch," "infertile" as "does not pass on offspring," and "parental genetic traits" as "parental characteristics," all based on the book "Biological Nomenclature."
    (3) There are only two new translated names in the book, namely "education method" and "hybrid-induced variation," which the reviewer considered inappropriate. Mentor is translated as "educator" because in Lysenko's book "Heredity and its Variation" there is a sentence "Method of mentor, or method of educator," so I translated it as education. As for the term "hybrid change," the reviewer believes that the existing translation is "contemporary dominance" and also suggests translating it as "direct effect of cross-pollination." We can at least see that "contemporary dominance" and "direct effect of cross-pollination" have completely different meanings. Here, the meaning is actually "change caused by cross-pollination," so I shortened it to hybrid-induced variation, which should be explained.
    (4) Finally, the stiffness of the writing is a fact, but this is because I was taking into account the tone of the original. For example, the title of the second chapter is very stiff in the English translation. "Fallibility of the view that simple transplantation of southern plants can change," because the original does not use "erroneous view," but "Fallibility of the view..." so it can only be translated as "...the view's error." Furthermore, in Chapter 15, "Breeding" is translated as "cultivation" by me, which the reviewer considers inappropriate, but in the original (as in Russian), this word is a verb. The original is "Breeding New Frost—resistant Peach Varieties" rather than "The Breeding of New Frost—resistant Peach Varieties," so it can only be translated as a verb, otherwise, translating it as "The Breeding of New Frost-resistant Peach Varieties" would certainly sound smoother.
  Gulou Publishing House's Review of "High School Entrance Examination Tool"
    Having read Mr. Song Lan's remarks in the book review column of the July 26th People's Daily pointing out the errors in the "High School Entrance Examination Tool" published by our publishing house, we express our sincere acceptance. Since July 26th, our publishing house has recalled all the books consigned to various bookstores and has notified the editors of the book to discuss and revise the erroneous parts. If readers find other inappropriate parts of the book, please send a letter directly to Gulou Publishing House within August for reference.
  Tianxia Book Company's Statement Regarding "The Iron Tree Blossoms"
    The "Reader's Voice" column in "Book Review" No. 9, in the section "Regarding One Book, Multiple Prints," states: "Tianxia Book Company also published Zeng Ke's 'The Iron Tree Blossoms' in February of this year." Upon investigation, the Zeng Ke's "The Iron Tree Blossoms" published by us was in October 1949, not "February of this year." It was earlier than the Shanghai Publishing Company's "Thousands of Miles Leap Forward," and even earlier than the East China Xinhua Bookstore's "Marching into Dabie Mountains." (Editor's note: According to the "The Iron Tree Blossoms" attached by Mr. Yu Lan, it is a reprint of February this year.)

　　检讨与声明
  张宗炳先生对“评‘原理与方法——米丘林五十年工作总结’”的声明
    七月十二日图书评论上载有叶笃庄先生对拙译《原理与方法》的批评，我应当虚心的接受，只是有几点我应加以解释。
    （一）书中的错误在所不免，有几处笔误尤其不应该，例如“属间”误为“族间”。“果树品种”之译成“果种”，乃是在校对时，我觉得题目太长，把“树品”二字删去，没有对原文，因而造成了错误，这些都是需要改正的。
    （二）另外有些译名可能有不妥之处，但本书所有译名完全采用马赛及郑葆珊二氏的“生物学名辞”，在目前译名没有一致之前，采用一本书上的译名可能一致些，因此，把“树冠”译为“花冠或顶枝”，“不孕”译为“不传后代”，“亲本遗传性状”译为“亲性格”等，都是根据“生物学名辞”一书的。
    （三）书中新的译名只有两个，即“教育法”及“杂交引变”评者都以为不妥当。Mentor之所以译成“教育者”，是因为李森柯的“遗传及其变异”的书上有一句“Method of mentor, or method of educator”因此把它译成教育。至于“杂交改变”一个名辞，评者以为现成的译名为“当代显性”又说可以译成“异花受粉的直接作用”。我们至少可以看出“当代显性”与“异花受粉的直接作用”意义全不相同，此处的意思实在是“异花受粉所引起的改变”，因此我把它简缩为杂交引变，这是应当解释的。
    （四）最后，文笔的生硬是事实，但是这是因为照顾到原文的语气：例如第二章的题目，英译本即十分生硬。“简单移植南方植物可以改变的观点之错误”，因为原文不用“错误的观点”，而为“Fallibility of the view……”因此只能译成“……的观点之错误”。再例如，第十五章之“Breeding”，我译成“栽培”，评者以为不妥，而原文中（俄文也如此）此字是动词，原文是“Breeding New Frost—resistant Peach Varieties”而不是“The Breedingof New Frost—resistant Peach Varieties”，因此只能译作动词，否则译作“新抗寒桃种之育种”，当然要念起来较为顺一些。
  鼓楼出版社对“高小升学工具”的检讨
    顷阅七月二十六日人民日报图书评论栏中宋岚先生指出本社出版“高小升学工具”上的错误，我们表示诚恳接受。七月二十六日起，本社已将在各书店寄售之书，全数收回，并通知本书的编者，讨论并修改错误的部分，读者如发现本书其他不妥之处，请在八月内迳函鼓楼出版社，俾作参考。
  天下图书公司对《铁树开了花》的声明
    《图书评论》第九号“读者之声”栏“关于一书数印”一节内说：“天下图书公司在今年二月也出版了曾克的《铁树开了花》”，查我们出版的曾克的《铁树开了花》是在一九四九年十月，并不是《今年二月》，当比上海出版公司的《千里跃进》早，比华东新华书店的《挺进大别山》更早。（编者按，查于蓝先生附来的《铁树开了花》，是本年二月的再版本。）
