　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Wallace, the bankrupt politician who recently encountered opposition from the vast majority of members of the American Progressive Party and withdrew from the Progressive Party for publicly declaring his support for the American imperialists' policy of aggression in Korea, delivered a speech inciting atomic war on the radio on the evening of the 10th. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York, Wallace, using the so-called "Soviet aggression" in Korea, which Truman and Acheson were accustomed to using, said that he "revised his opposition to the atomic bomb" and "believes that events have proven that the use of the atomic bomb is justified."

    【新华社十五日讯】新近因公开声明支持美国帝国主义者侵略朝鲜的政策而遭到美国进步党绝大部分党员的反对并退出进步党的华莱士，十日晚又在广播中发表了煽动原子战争的谈话。据路透社纽约消息，华莱士在广播中以杜鲁门、艾奇逊所惯用的所谓“苏联侵略”朝鲜为理由，说他“修正了对原子弹的反对”。“认为事件已证明用原子弹是正当的”。
