Soldier Poems

           Reorganization (Note 1)
    Talking about reorganization, talking about reorganization,
    Reorganization is for the counter-offensive battle;
    Guerrilla warfare can't fight big battles,
    Field battles and city sieges are not difficult.
    We reorganized on August 1st,
    Every comrade's face is smiling;
    You practice martial arts, I sharpen my knife,
    The three major skills (Note 2) must be learned well.
    Class consciousness is raised,
    Take down Ping, Tianjin, and Baoding in central Hebei,
    Use American weapons,
    Put your name on the merit book.
    (Note 1) When the War of Liberation was approaching the counter-offensive stage, the scattered local guerrilla forces were no longer suitable for the new war needs and had to be reorganized. This is a clapper talk made by soldiers during the reorganization of a certain brigade in central Hebei.
    (Note 2) Namely shooting, blasting, and throwing grenades.

           Landmine
　
           One
　
    The landmine is black and big,
    Chiang Kai-shek is really scared;
    With a booming sound,
    The enemy surrendered their guns.
　
           Two
　
    The landmine is big, like a watermelon,
    Doesn't take root, doesn't sprout;
    It blooms when it encounters bandit troops.
           Instructor
    The instructor is really great,
    Helps me, carries the machine gun;
    Few houses, sleeps in the yard;
    He pushes the millstone at night;
    Gets up early, fetches water;
    No one in the entire company falls behind.
           The Masses
    The liberated area is really strong,
    The masses are like fathers and mothers;
    Boil water and cook;
    Vacate the house and sweep the kang.
    The children's corps sings songs,
    After shouting slogans, it's "One, two, three";
    The old uncle is really attached,
    Helps the cook carry the oil bucket.
    Comrades have blisters on their feet,
    The village chief is busy harnessing the cart,
    Yellow cornbread, red yams,
    The old woman brings them out one by one;
    Take one when you see one,
    The old woman pulls my sleeve,
    Saying, comrade, don't refuse;
    People are iron, food is steel,
    Eat a piece of dry food and fight Chiang Kai-shek.
    The military and the people are truly of one heart,
    Closer than flesh and blood;
    People's hearts are made of flesh,
    Achieve great merit to repay the folks.
           Tools
    Fighting relies on guns,
    Production relies on tools,
    If you don't love it,
    You will reduce productivity.
       Study
    Keep a diary during production,
    Never forget to study;
    Learn to write, learn to read,
    Go to the fields and finish work collectively,
    Maintain our military discipline.
　
           Comrade Li Yao's Sheep Herding Song
　
           One
　
    The rooster crows, the sky dawns,
    Li Yao drives the sheep out of the village,
    Holding the whip and singing:
    Revolutionary soldiers go to herd sheep,
    Thinking of the past and now, it's different,
    In the past, herding sheep for the landlord,
    Beaten and scolded, starving,
    Only given a piece of tattered clothing a year.
    Now herding my own sheep,
    I herd sheep for great production.
　
           Two
　
    The sun is warm, warm,
    He doesn't forget to study while herding sheep,
    The study book is on his leg,
    The New People's pen is black and bright,
    Yellow nib, blue ink,
    He draws sheep like the sheep,
    Big sheep, small sheep, dappled sheep,
    Black sheep, white sheep lined up,
    After drawing, he writes words,
    To be a good example of learning.
　
           Three
　
    The wild grass is green and yellow, green and yellow,
    The sheep eat grass deliciously,
    By the road, on the hillside,
    The sound of eating grass is rustling,
    The little sheep bleats to call the mother sheep,
    The mother sheep bleats to call the little sheep,
    The little sheep runs to the mother sheep,
    Kneels down on both legs to taste the milk,
    The rams stand on their front legs and butt heads in pairs.
　
           Four
　
    The whip cracks, cracks,
    The lead sheep runs busily on four legs,
    Running in front to lead the way,
    Four hundred sheep line up.
    The water in the mountain ditch rushes,
    The sheep lower their heads to drink water busily,
    The sheep have eaten and drunk enough,
    The sun sets in the western mountains,
    Li Yao raises his whip to drive the sheep,
    Singing and shouting, he returns to the village.
　
           Five
　
    Li Yao is busy at night, Li Yao is busy,
    Not afraid of the cold and windy weather,
    Gets up several times a night,
    Goes to the sheepfold to check on the sheep,
    The mother sheep bleats,
    Gave birth to a pair of little lambs,
    The little lambs don't recognize milk when they are first born,
    He squeezes the milk to feed the little lambs,
    Afraid that the little lambs will get cold,
    He carries them to the heated kang in the house to warm the little lambs.
       Six
　
    Producing by herding sheep, herding sheep,
    Li Yao the shepherd is really strong,
    The production plan is well-written,
    Written on paper one by one,
    The first is not afraid of the cold,
    The second is to ensure that the sheep are fat,
    The third is to ensure the survival of the lambs,
    The fourth is to ensure that the pen is not dirty,
    Finally, he wrote a small sentence:
    "Herding sheep and earning merit will make my name famous."

### 战士诗歌

　　战士诗歌
    赵文彬录
           整编（注一）
    说整编，道整编，
    整编为了反攻战；
    游击不能打大仗，
    野战攻城不费难。
    八一我们整编了，
    个个同志面带笑；
    你练武，我磨刀，
    三大技术（注二）要学好。
    阶级觉悟都提高，
    打下冀中的平、津、保，
    美国武器使一使，
    功劳簿上把名标。
    （注一）当解放战争接近反攻时，分散的地方的游击部队已不适合新的战争需要，必须实行整编，这是冀中某旅整编时战士所作的快板。
    （注二）即射击、爆破、投弹。
　
           地雷
　
           一
　
    地雷黑又大，
    老蒋真害怕；
    轰隆一声响，
    敌人缴了枪。
　
           二
　
    地雷大，像西瓜，
    不生根，不长芽；
    碰上匪军就开花。
           指导员
    指导员，真是棒，
    帮助我，扛机枪；
    房子少，院里睡；
    黑夜他把碾子推；
    打早起，就挑水；
    全连谁也不掉队。
           群众
    解放区，真是强，
    群众好比爹和娘；
    又烧水，又做饭；
    腾了屋子还扫炕。
    儿童团，唱着歌，
    喊完口号就是“一、二、三”；
    老大伯，真是沾，
    帮助伙夫把油挑子担。
    同志们脚上打了泡，
    村长忙把大车套，
    黄饽饽，红山药，
    大娘一个一个往外端；
    见一个，拿一块，
    大娘把我袖子拉，
    叫声同志别打呱；
    人是铁，饭是钢，
    吃块干粮打老蒋。
    军民真是一条心，
    比着骨肉亲十分；
    人心都是肉来长，
    立个大功报老乡。
           工具
    打仗靠枪杆，
    生产靠工具，
    你要不爱它，
    减少生产力。
       学习
    生产当中记日记，
    千万不要忘学习；
    学写作，学识字，
    下地收工都集体，
    保持咱们的军风纪。
　
           李尧同志放羊歌
　
           一
　
    公鸡咯咯的叫，天发亮，
    李尧赶着羊儿出村庄，
    手拿着鞭儿嘴里唱：
    革命军人去放羊，
    想从前和如今不一样，
    从前是给地主把羊放，
    挨打挨骂饿肚肠，
    一年只给一身破衣裳。
    如今放羊自己的羊，
    大生产我把羊儿放。
　
           二
　
    太阳暖洋洋，暖洋洋，
    放羊他不把学习忘，
    学习本，搁腿上，
    新民笔杆发黑亮，
    黄黄笔尖蓝蓝水，
    他比着羊儿来画羊，
    大羊小羊花黧羊，
    黑羊白羊排成行，
    画完就把字来写，
    要作学习的好榜样。
　
           三
　
    野草儿青又黄，青又黄，
    羊儿吃草喷喷香，
    大路旁，山坡上，
    吃草的声音嚓嚓地响，
    小羊??的把母羊叫，
    母羊??的叫小羊，
    小羊跑到母羊旁，
    双腿跪下把奶尝，
    公羊一对一对的前腿站起来把头撞。
　
           四
　
    大鞭子呱呱的响，呱呱的响，
    头羊四条腿儿跑的忙，
    跑在群前去领路，
    四百只羊儿排成行。
    山沟的水，哗哗的响，
    羊儿低头喝水忙，
    羊儿吃饱喝足了，
    太阳落在西山上，
    李尧举鞭赶着羊，
    唱唱喝喝的回村庄。
　
           五
　
    黑夜李尧忙，李尧忙，
    不怕天寒风又凉，
    一宿起来好几趟，
    到羊圈里看看羊，
    母羊??的叫，
    下了一对小绵羊，
    小羊才下不认奶，
    他挤下奶儿喂小羊，
    又怕小羊受了冻，
    抱到屋炕上去暖小羊。
       六
　
    生产把羊放，把羊放，
    放羊的李尧真是强，
    生产计划订得好，
    一条一条写纸上，
    第一条不怕天寒冷，
    二条保证羊肥胖，
    三条保证小羊活，
    四条保证圈不脏，
    最后又写了一小句：
    “放羊立功把名扬”。
