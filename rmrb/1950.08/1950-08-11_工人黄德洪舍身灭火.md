　　Worker Huang Dehong Selflessly Extinguishes Fire
　　Ke Qing
　　Huang Dehong is a 20-year-old worker in the opening and cleaning section of the private Yuhua Cotton Mill in Wuhan. Since joining the trade union last year, under its leadership, he has been working diligently and happily. He knows that only through hard work can he gradually improve his life.
　　Two opening and cleaning machines are placed side by side in the opening and cleaning section. One is new, and the other is quite old. Therefore, it is prone to catching fire in the flower vat when it encounters iron slag. This has happened several times, and each time it was quickly put out by the workers.
　　On the afternoon of July 5th, the flower vat of the old machine caught fire again. The workers in charge of this machine panicked for a moment and rushed to the front to put out the fire, forgetting to turn off the power. The machine was running, and the flower vat was spinning rapidly. The wind inside was very strong, and the cotton was rushing forward. The fire was burning more and more fiercely, and the flower vat was turning red, with the fire spreading along the windpipe. Although Huang Dehong was in charge of another new machine, he was familiar with every fine detail of the old machine's process, as he said, "We are in this line of work, and we know exactly where the problem is." At that time, seeing that the fire was getting bigger, he quickly shouted, "Turn off the power!" But the workers were already in a panic, only caring to carry buckets of water and pour them on the flower vat. However, the water could not suppress the fire. The situation was serious and urgent. He thought that if the opening and cleaning machine was burned down, half of the machines would have to stop, and hundreds of workers would be out of work, and it might even lead to a greater disaster. He thought of going to turn off the power, but then he immediately thought: the wire head was already burned, and the switch was leaking electricity. To turn it off would mean sacrificing himself. But he thought, "The fire must be put out! It's not like before now; I can't just watch it burn down for my own sake!" At this time, he didn't care about anything else. He ran over and grabbed the switch with his left hand, pushing it hard. The fire was quickly extinguished. But Huang Dehong had already been knocked to the ground by the electricity, his hair, left face, and left hand were burned. He rolled on the ground and finally passed out. The comrades in the factory's clinic gave him an emergency injection before he woke up, and then sent him to the hospital for treatment. Because of his severe injuries and the hot weather, the trade union comrades prepared to put him in a special ward, but he asked the hospital: Are the medicines used in the special ward the same as those in the ordinary ward? When he learned that the medicines were exactly the same, he insisted on staying in the ordinary ward. Because he thought: if the medicine in the special ward was better, he could recover and return to work sooner, and it would be worth spending more money every day, but it was unnecessary just for taking care of himself.
　　A person who can sacrifice himself for everyone is respected and loved by the masses. In the hospital, the factory's Party, Youth League, and trade union comrades all went to see him, comfort him, encourage him, and tell him the story of Zhao Guilan. The workers in the opening and cleaning section all went to see him, and some workers' families even bought him snacks and fruits. He felt immense honor and happiness. The injury on his face healed quickly, and the injury to his hand also lightened. In less than two weeks, he returned home to rest, going to the clinic every day to change his dressings. He said, "If it had been before liberation, even if I had died, they would have said it was my own carelessness, and who would have cared about you? But now, even with a minor injury, the trade union takes such good care of me. How can we not work hard?"
　　Huang Dehong is a young and outstanding trade union member, and he possesses the noble qualities of the working class. Recently, in order to make faster progress and do his work even better, he has submitted a request to the Youth League branch to join the League.

　　工人黄德洪舍身灭火
　　柯晴
    黄德洪是武汉私营裕华纱厂清花间的工人，今年二十岁。他自去年参加工会后，在工会的领导下，一直是辛勤愉快地工作着。他知道只有努力生产，才能逐步使生活得到改善。
    清花间并排放着两部清花机，一部是新的，另一部已相当老了，所以遇着铁渣子，旧车子的和花缸就会起火。这情形已发生过好几次，每一次都被工友们很快的扑灭了。
    七月五号下午，老机器的和花缸又起了火。掌管这部机器的工友一时都慌着到前面去救火，忘了关电门。机器转动着，和花缸走得飞快，里边风力很大，棉花一个劲的往前走。火越烧越凶，和花缸烧成通红的了，火顺着风筒蔓延。黄德洪虽是看管另一部新车子的，但他熟习这个老机器的每一个精细的过程，正如他所说的：“我们是干这一行的，那里有毛病自己就知道得清清楚楚。”当时他看火烧大了，就连忙喊：“快关电门！”但是工友们已经慌乱了，只顾提着水桶一个劲向和花缸上泼。可是，水压不住火的燃烧。事情严重而紧急，他想到烧毁了这部清花机，就要停一半车子，几百工人没工做，甚致还会酿成更大的灾害。他想去关电门，但马上又想到：电线已烧破了头，电门走电，要关就得牺牲自己。但是他想：“火不能不救，现在不比从前了，不能为了自己看着他烧坏！”这时候他什么也顾不得了，他跑过去用左手抓着电门狠力地推，火很快的熄灭了。但是黄德洪已被电力打倒在地，头发、左脸、左手都烧着了。他在地上滚动着，最后昏了过去。厂里的医务所同志，给他打了急救针才醒过来，接着就送他到医院去治疗。因为伤重，天气又热，工会同志们预备叫他住特等病房，但他却向医院打听：特等病房与普通病房用药是不是一样？当他知道用药完全一样时，他坚持住了普通病房。因为他想：如果特等病房药好，可以早些治好恢复工作，每天多花些钱还说得过去，而仅仅是为了照顾自己是用不着的。
    能为大家而牺牲自己的人，是受群众的尊敬和爱戴的。在医院里，工厂的党、团、工会的同志们都去看他，安慰他，鼓励他，给他讲赵桂兰的故事。清花间的工友们都去看过他，有的工友家属还给他买了点心、水果。他感到莫大的光荣和幸福。脸上的伤很快好了，手的伤势也轻了。不到两星期的时间，他便回到家里休息，每天到医务所换药。他说：“要是在解放前，就是死了，还说你自己不小心，那个管你呢？而现在受一点伤，工会就这样照顾，我们还能不好好生产？”
    黄德洪是一个年青的优秀工会会员，他有着工人阶级高贵的品质。最近，他为了自己更快的进步，把工作做得更好，已经向团支部提出了入团的要求。
