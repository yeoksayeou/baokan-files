　　The Great Achievements of Democratic Construction by the People of North Korea in the Past Five Years
　　Xue Mouhong
    On August 15, 1945, the great Soviet army liberated North Korea. Since then, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung and with the help of international friends, the people of North Korea began to build a new, democratic, independent, unified, prosperous, and strong motherland.
    First, the Korean people established People's Committees at all levels in provinces, cities, counties (districts), and townships (areas). Then, the Soviet occupying forces transferred all enemy properties confiscated according to law to the People's Committees of each province, and actively assisted them in their economic recovery efforts.
    On October 18, 1945, representatives of the Five Provinces People's Committees of North Korea held a "Joint Conference of the Five Provinces People's Committees" in Pyongyang to discuss agricultural production and food supply, the transition of military production to peaceful production, the preparation and unification of local institutions, and financial matters. As a result of the meeting, it was decided to establish ten North Korean administrative bureaus for industry, transportation, agriculture and forestry, commerce, postal service, finance, education, health, justice, and security, to uniformly guide the work of various departments in the five provinces of North Korea.
    On December 27, 1945, the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference announced the correct resolution on the Korean issue. Mass rallies were held in various parts of Korea to celebrate and support the achievements of the Three Foreign Ministers Conference.
    In order to promote the establishment of a unified democratic government in Korea and to uniformly guide the various construction undertakings in North Korea, representatives of various democratic political parties, social organizations, administrative bureaus, and People's Committees of provinces, cities, and counties in North Korea held a "Conference of Representatives of People's Committees of Provinces and Counties and Representatives of Anti-Japanese Democratic Political Parties and Social Organizations in North Korea" on February 6, 1946. The conference unanimously adopted the establishment of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, elected General Kim Il-sung as Chairman, Kim Tu-bong as Vice Chairman, and twenty-one other members. In addition, the conference put forward specific current tasks as the goals of struggle for People's Committees at all levels.
    On March 23, 1946, Chairman Kim Il-sung published his "Twenty Point Program," which is one of the most glorious documents in Korean history. Based on Chairman Kim Il-sung's Twenty Point Program, the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea immediately began large-scale democratic reforms. First, it carried out a comprehensive land reform in North Korea.
    The "Land Reform Law" stipulated that all land owned by the Japanese state, Japanese people, Japanese organizations, Korean national traitors, and Korean landlords, as well as land exceeding five chongbo owned by Korean rich peasants, should be confiscated without compensation and distributed without compensation to hired laborers, tenant farmers, and poor farmers. As a result of the correct implementation of this law, nearly 700,000 landless and land-poor farmers obtained nearly one million chongbo of new land, thereby increasing farmers' enthusiasm and liberating rural productivity.
    Subsequently, on June 24, 1946, the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea promulgated the "Labor Law for Korean Workers and Staff," guaranteeing an eight-hour workday for all workers and staff in North Korea (reduced to a seven-hour workday in harmful labor and underground labor departments), implementing social insurance and equal pay for equal work, and granting them at least two weeks of paid vacation per year (increased to at least four weeks in harmful labor and underground labor departments). In addition, the law stipulated that female workers have the right to rest for thirty-five days before childbirth and forty-two days after childbirth, prohibited children under the age of fourteen from working in factories, adopted a six-hour workday for child laborers aged fourteen to sixteen, authorized the Production Bureau and the General Federation of Trade Unions to supervise and inspect the safety equipment of various enterprises and institutions, and implemented a collective contract system in private enterprises, thus making the working class of North Korea truly stand up and become the masters of the new country.
    Three days after the promulgation of the Labor Law, the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea issued the "Decision on Agricultural Tax in Kind," implementing a 25 percent agricultural tax in kind system for North Korean farmers.
    On July 30, 1946, the government also formulated the "North Korean Law on Equal Rights for Men and Women," eliminating the multiple oppressions suffered by Korean women before liberation. It guaranteed women absolute equality with men in all aspects of political, economic, cultural, and social life, implemented freedom of marriage and monogamy, and permanently abolished the prostitute system.
    On August 10, the North Korean authorities passed the "Law on the Nationalization of Industry, Transportation, Transportation, Postal Service, Banks, etc.," nationalizing all factories, mines, power plants, railways, transportation, postal service, banks, commercial and cultural institutions of the Japanese state, Japanese people, Japanese organizations, and Korean national traitors. This enabled the Korean People's Government to control more than 90 percent of North Korea's industrial economy.
    Following the Law on Nationalization of Industry was the "Decision on Protecting Individual Ownership and Promoting Individual Creativity in Industrial and Commercial Activities" of October 4, which stipulated that the movable and immovable property of the Korean people shall not be confiscated without a ruling of the People's Court or a special decision of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea; if there are shares of Korean people in the confiscated enemy and puppet industries, they shall be appropriately disposed of according to the request of the Korean shareholders; the state may sell or lend some small-scale enterprises and institutions to private industrialists and businessmen for operation; and North Korean banks shall provide private industrialists and businessmen with necessary short-term loans, etc.
    The above-mentioned important democratic reforms were all victoriously completed by the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea under the leadership of the Communist Party of North Korea. In addition to actively leading and promoting the above-mentioned democratic reforms, the Communist Party of North Korea and its leader, Chairman Kim Il-sung, also began to organize the united front. On July 22, 1946, according to Chairman Kim Il-sung's proposal, the democratic political parties and social organizations of North Korea formed the "North Korean Democratic National United Front" to fight for the consolidation of the motherland's unification, independence, and democratic construction. Subsequently, the Communist Party of North Korea merged with the New People's Party of Korea (August 28, 1946) to establish the Workers' Party of North Korea, representing the interests of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, as the backbone and leader of the North Korean Democratic National United Front.
    On February 17, 1947, the historically significant "North Korean Provincial, City, and County People's Committee Congress" was held in Pyongyang. Attending were representatives elected by the People's Committees of provinces, cities, and counties at a ratio of three members per representative. The Workers' Party of North Korea, the Democratic Party of North Korea, the Chondoist Chongu Party of North Korea, the General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea, the Democratic Youth League of North Korea, and the Democratic Women's League of North Korea also each sent five representatives to participate. The congress unanimously ratified the various laws and decrees promulgated by the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea, formulated the 1947 North Korean People's Economic Recovery and Development Plan, and established the North Korean People's Assembly based on the proposal of the North Korean Democratic National United Front, organized by one delegate elected from every five delegates.
    On February 21, the North Korean People's Assembly was officially established, and then organized the North Korean People's Committee, as the central executive body of North Korea, with General Kim Il-sung as chairman.
    At that time, an important task facing the Korean people was to formulate a democratic constitution to affirm the achievements of various democratic reforms and to point out the direction for the future struggle of the Korean people. Therefore, at its third meeting held on November 18, 1947, the North Korean People's Assembly decided to establish a "Korean Provisional Constitution Drafting Committee" to carry out the drafting of the constitution.
    Chairman Kim Il-sung presented a summary of the 1947 North Korean People's Economic Recovery and Development Plan to the fourth meeting of the North Korean People's Assembly.
    On the basis of the victorious overfulfillment of the 1947 plan, Chairman Kim Il-sung proposed the 1948 North Korean People's Economic Recovery and Development Plan for consideration by the North Korean People's Assembly.
    The North Korean People's Assembly approved Chairman Kim Il-sung's draft of the 1948 economic plan and immediately began the revision of the constitutional draft. The congress finally decided to accept the suggestion of Chairman Kim Tu-bong and submit the draft constitution initially drafted by the Provisional Constitution Drafting Committee to all the Korean people for extensive discussion for two months.
    February 8, 1948, was the first anniversary of the founding of the North Korean People's Army. The North Korean People's Army was declared born. Although this army has only been around for two and a half years from its creation to now, its power has made the world's most ferocious American imperialists terrified.
    In April 1948, based on the proposal of General Kim Il-sung, the North Korean Democratic National United Front invited representatives of democratic political parties and social organizations in South Korea to hold a "Joint Conference of Representatives of Political Parties and Social Organizations in All of Korea" in Pyongyang to discuss issues such as opposing the separate election in South Korea and the peaceful reunification of the motherland. As a result of the meeting, the "Resolution on the Political Situation in Korea" and the "Declaration to All Korean Compatriots" were adopted, calling on the people of North and South Korea to unite to fight against the May 10th false election and demand the withdrawal of foreign troops. After the conference closed, the leaders of democratic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea held a meeting at the end of April and issued their joint statement, supporting the Soviet proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of Soviet and American troops from Korea, and advocating that a political conference of all Korea be convened after the withdrawal of foreign troops to establish a democratic provisional government, and then the latter would preside over the election of the Korean legislative body to formulate a constitution and produce a democratic unified government.
    From June 29 to July 3, representatives of democratic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea held another meeting to decide to establish the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea on the basis of democratic general elections, which would formulate the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and organize the central government of Korea.
    Subsequently, the North Korean People's Assembly convened its fifth meeting on July 9, fully approving the resolutions of the conference of leaders of democratic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea. It also decided to immediately implement the Korean Provisional Constitution passed by the special meeting of the North Korean People's Assembly on April 28 in North Korea, and submit it to the Supreme People's Assembly to be established as the draft constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    On August 25, 1948, North and South Korea held a comprehensive democratic general election. At that time, South Korea was still under the suppression of reactionary forces, so the conference of leaders of political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea decided to conduct elections in different ways in the North and South. North Korea adopted a direct, equal, universal, and secret voting method to elect 212 representatives to the Supreme People's Assembly, while South Korea adopted a two-level indirect election method, in which the people of South Korea first elected 1,002 representatives to the South Korean People's Congress underground, and then these representatives elected 360 representatives from South Korea to attend the Supreme People's Assembly.
    As a result of the election, 99.98 percent of voters in the North participated in the voting, and 77.52 percent of voters in the South participated in the underground voting. Among the 572 newly elected members, farmers accounted for 194, workers accounted for 120, intellectuals accounted for 192, merchants accounted for 22, national capitalists accounted for 29, and other components accounted for 15.
    On September 2, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea opened in Pyongyang. Five days later, it adopted the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on the basis of the draft constitution prepared by the North Korean People's Assembly.
    The day after the new constitution was passed, the Supreme People's Assembly elected the Standing Committee, with Kim Tu-bong as chairman. Under the proposal of Chairman Kim Tu-bong, General Kim Il-sung was appointed as the Premier of the Cabinet and began to organize the new government.
    On September 12, Premier Kim Il-sung delivered the Cabinet's policy program in the Supreme People's Assembly, pointing out that "demanding the immediate withdrawal of the US and Soviet troops in accordance with the Soviet proposal" is the basic condition for Korea to seek unification. He declared the South Korean puppet government and all its laws illegal, vigorously stated that Korea will maintain stable and friendly relations with all countries that love peace and respect Korea's freedom and independence, and strongly opposed the US imperialism's support for Japan's resurgence. Finally, he declared that North Korea will consolidate its national defense and strengthen the people's army to defend the Korean people's motherland.
    Soon, the Soviet government announced its withdrawal from North Korea at the request of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea.
    On January 28, 1949, the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea held its second meeting to hear the government's summary report on the implementation of the 1948 economic plan. Thanks to the struggle of the working people, the correct leadership of General Kim Il-sung, and the help of international friends, Korea's economy has made considerable progress in 1948.
    The Supreme People's Assembly accepted the summary report of the 1948 economic plan and began to formulate the 1949-50 North Korean People's Economic Development Plan. The main contents of the two-year economic plan in terms of economic construction: (taking 1948 as 100, the percentage in 1950)
    Total output of state-owned industry              194.1%
    Labor productivity in state-owned industry               138.2%
    Production cost of state-owned industry       63.7%
    Grain harvest                                     107.9%
    Cotton harvest                                    159.1%
    Aquatic product harvest                           124.9%
    Total railway transportation                    153.8%
    Volume of state and cooperative trade          182.5%
    In addition to economic construction, the two-year economic plan also decided to implement a comprehensive compulsory education system from 1950, increase the number of primary schools, middle schools, and universities and the number of students, strengthen technical education and adult education, develop textbook publishing, news, magazines, and film industries, build a large number of hospitals and sanatoriums, and strengthen epidemic prevention, health care, and social insurance measures, etc.
    Shortly after the two-year economic plan was passed, Premier Kim Il-sung visited the Soviet Union and signed the Soviet-Korean Economic and Cultural Cooperation Agreement with the Soviet government, and based on this agreement, four agreements were established between the Soviet Union and Korea on the exchange of goods, loans, technical assistance, and cultural exchanges. This has greatly helped the smooth completion of the two-year economic plan.
    Subsequently, in order to strengthen mutual unity and strive for the rapid unification of the country and the smooth development of economic and cultural construction, the political parties and social organizations of North and South Korea established the All-Korean Democratic Fatherland Unification Front in Pyongyang on June 25 last year. Seventy-one democratic political parties and social organizations from the North and South participated in this Fatherland Front. They elected a 99-member Central Committee, which in turn produced a Central Secretariat as the highest guiding body of the entire United Front. The first members of the Secretariat were Premier Kim Il-sung, Chairman Kim Tu-bong, and Deputy Premier Park Heon-yeong, among others.
    Last year, in March, November, and December, North Korea held three elections for the People's Committees of provinces, cities, counties, districts, the People's Committees of villages, and the People's Committees of townships, respectively. Some important figures in these three elections are listed below:
    Levels of People's Committees      Voting Ratio      Total Number of Members    Number of Worker Members  Number of Farmer Members  Number of Women Members
    People's Committees of Provinces, Cities, Counties, and Districts  99.98%  5853    1549    2259    869
    People's Committees of Villages        99%        56113  2780    51471  8494
    People's Committees of Townships        98.9%    13354  1572    9337    2146
    At the end of last year, the planned targets for the first year of the two-year economic plan had been overfulfilled, and at the cabinet meeting at the beginning of this year, it was necessary to further increase the targets of the two-year economic plan according to the general demands of the Korean people.
    Due to the vigorous development of economic construction, the material living standards of the working people have been continuously improved. Compared with 1946, workers' wages have increased by 80 percent in the first half of this year, while prices have fallen by half. This continuous improvement in material living standards is bound to generate a strong demand for culture among the working people. Therefore, in addition to vigorously strengthening various cultural activities, the Korean government also promulgated the "Law on the Implementation of Universal Primary Compulsory Education" by the Supreme People's Assembly in January this year, requiring all 1.5 million North Korean school-age children to enroll in school this autumn.
    Now the Korean People's Army is rapidly advancing southward, enabling various democratic reforms in North Korea to be implemented one by one in the liberated areas of South Korea. We believe that in the near future, all 30 million people of Korea will enjoy democratic happiness in the free territory of the motherland.

　　五年来北朝鲜人民的民主建设的伟大成就
　　薛谋洪
    一九四五年八月十五日伟大的苏联军队解放了北朝鲜。从此以后，北朝鲜人民在金日成将军领导和国际友人帮助之下，开始建设自己民主独立统一富强的新祖国。
    首先，朝鲜人民在各地成立了道、市、郡（县）、面（区）各级人民委员会，接着苏联进驻军即将依法所没收的敌产完全移交予各道人民委员会，并积极协助它们致力于经济复兴的工作。
    一九四五年十月十八日北朝鲜五道人民委员会代表在平壤召开“五道人民委员会联席会议”讨论农业生产与食粮供应，军事生产转入和平生产，地方机构的整备统一以及财政金融等问题。会议结果决定成立产业、交通、农林、商业、递信、财政、教育、保健、司法、保安等十个北朝鲜行政局，分别统一指导北朝鲜五道的各部门工作。
    一九四五年十二月二十七日，莫斯科三外长会议公布了关于朝鲜问题的正确决议。朝鲜各地纷纷举行群众大会，对三外长会议的成就表示庆祝与拥护。
    为了促成朝鲜统一的民主政权之树立，并统一地指导北朝鲜的各项建设事业之进行，北朝鲜各民主政党社会团体各行政局，与各道市郡人民委员会之代表乃于一九四六年二月六日举行了一次“北朝鲜各道各郡人民委员会代表与反日民主主义政党与社会团体代表会议”。一致通过成立北朝鲜临时人民委员会，选出金日成将军为委员长、金枓奉为副委员长，以及其他委员二十一人。此外该会并提出当前具体任务，作为各级人民委员会的斗争目标。
    一九四六年三月二十三日，金日成委员长发表了他的“二十条政纲”，这是朝鲜历史上最光辉的文献之一。根据金日成委员长的二十条政纲，北朝鲜临时人民委员会立即开始了大规模的民主改革。首先它在北朝鲜进行全面的土地改革。
    “土地改革法令”规定：日本国家、日本人、日本团体、朝鲜民族叛逆者及朝鲜地主之所有土地以及朝鲜富农的超过五町步以上之土地应一律无偿地予以没收，并将其无偿地分配予雇工、佃农和贫农。由于这个法令正确实施的结果，近七十万无地少地的农民获得近百万町步的新土地，农民的积极性因而提高，农村的生产力也因而解放了。
    接着北朝鲜临时人民委员会在一九四六年六月二十四日颁布了“对朝鲜劳动者及事务员的劳动法令”，对全北朝鲜职工保证八小时工作制（在有害劳动及地下劳动部门改为七小时工作制），实行社会保险和同工同酬的办法，并给予他们每年至少两周工资照付的休假（在有害劳动及地下劳动部门改为每年最少四周）。此外该法令还规定女职工在产前三十五天产后四十二天有休息权，禁止十四岁以下的儿童在工厂工作，对十四岁至十六岁的童工采取六小时工作制，授权生产局及职工总同盟监督检查各企业机关的安全设备，并在私营企业中实行集体契约制度，这样就使得北朝鲜的工人阶级真正翻了身而成为新国家的主人。
    在劳动法令颁布的后三天，北朝鲜临时人民委员会又发表了“关于农业现物税的决定书”，对北朝鲜农民实行百分之二十五的农业现物税制。
    一九四六年七月三十日，政府又制定了“北朝鲜男女平等权法令”，消灭朝鲜妇女在解放前所受到的重重压迫。它保障妇女在政治经济文化社会生活各方面与男子地位的绝对平等，实行婚姻自由与一夫一妻制，并永远废除妓女制度。
    八月十日北朝鲜当局通过了“产业、交通、运输、递信、银行等的国有化法令”，把日本国家，日本人，日本团体及朝鲜民族叛逆者的一切工厂、矿山、发电所、铁道、运输、递信、银行、商业及文化机关一律收归国有。这使得占北朝鲜工业经济百分之九十以上的企业为朝鲜人民政府的掌握。
    继产业国有化法令之后的是十月四日的“关于保护个人所有权，发挥个人在工商业活动上的创造性之决定书”其中规定朝鲜人民的动产不动产非经人民法院的裁判或北朝鲜临时人民委员会的特别决定不得没收，被没收的敌伪产业中如有朝鲜人民的股分应根据朝鲜股东的请求作适当的处置，国家可以将一些小规模的企业机构出售或贷借予私人工商业家经营，北朝鲜各银行应当给予私营工商业以必要的短期贷款等等。
    以上各项重要的民主改革都是北朝鲜临时人民委员会在北朝鲜共产党领导之下所胜利完成的。北朝鲜共产党及其领袖金日成委员长除了积极领导并推动上述的各项民主改革外，还同时着手于统一战线的组织工作。一九四六年七月二十二日北朝鲜的各民主政党和社会团体根据金日成委员长的提议，结成了“北朝鲜民主主义民族统一战线”，为祖国的统一独立与民主建设的巩固化而斗争。接着北朝鲜共产党又与朝鲜新民党合并（一九四六年八月二十八日），成立了代表工农及革命智识分子利益的北朝鲜劳动党，作为北朝鲜民主民族统一战线之骨干与领导者。
    一九四七年二月十七日有历史意义的“北朝鲜道市郡人民委员会大会在平壤召开。出席的是各道市郡人民委员会按三个委员一个代表的比例所推选出来的代表。北朝鲜劳动党、北朝鲜民主党、北朝鲜天道教青友党、北朝鲜职业总同盟、北朝鲜民主青年同盟和北朝鲜民主妇女总同盟也各派代表五名参加。大会一致追认北朝鲜临时人民委员会所颁布的各种法令，制定了一九四七年北朝鲜人民经济复兴发展计划，并根据北朝鲜民主民族统一战线的提议设立北朝鲜人民会议，由大会代表中每五名选举一名代议员组织之。
    二月二十一日北朝鲜人民会议正式成立，接着组织北朝鲜人民委员会，作为北朝鲜的中央执行机关，以金日成将军为委员长。
    当时摆在朝鲜人民面前的一项重要任务就是制定民主的宪法以确定各项民主改革的成果，并为朝鲜人民今后的斗争指出方向。因此北朝鲜人民会议在一九四七年十一月十八日召开的第三次会议中决定成立“朝鲜临时宪法制订委员会”，从事宪章的起草工作。
    金日成委员长向北朝鲜人民会议第四次会议提出了一九四七年北朝鲜人民经济复兴发展计划的总结。
    在一九四七年计划胜利地超额完成的基础上，金日成委员长又提出了一九四八年的北朝鲜人民经济复兴发展计划，请求北朝鲜人民会议加以审议。
    北朝鲜人民会议通过了金日成委员长的一九四八年经济计划草案，并立即开始宪草的修订工作。大会最后决定接受金枓奉议长的建议把临时宪法制订委员会所初步拟就的宪草交给全朝鲜人民作两个月广泛的讨论。
    一九四八年二月八日，就是北朝鲜人民委员会成立的一周年纪念日，北朝鲜的人民军宣告诞生。这支军队虽然从创立到现在还不过两年半，但是它的威力已使世界上最凶恶的美帝国主义者望而丧胆。
    一九四八年四月，北朝鲜民主主义民族统一战线根据金日成将军的提议，邀请南朝鲜各民主政党社团的代表在平壤举行了一次“全朝鲜政党社会团体代表者联席会议”，讨论反对南朝鲜单独选举及祖国和平统一等问题。会议结果通过了“关于朝鲜政治情势的决议书”，及“告全朝鲜同胞檄”，呼吁南北朝鲜的人民一致为反对五·十伪选与要求外军撤退而斗争。该会闭幕后南北朝鲜各民主政党社团的指导者又于四月底召开了协议会，发表他们的共同声明书，支持苏联所提苏美两军同时自朝鲜撤退的建议，并主张在外军撤去后召集一全朝鲜政治会议，成立民主临时政府，再由后者主持朝鲜立法机关的选举，以制订宪法，产生民主统一政府。
    南北朝鲜各民主政党社团代表六月二十九日至七月三日，又举行协议会，决定在民主普选的基础上创设朝鲜最高人民会议，由它制定朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法，并组织朝鲜中央政府。
    接着北朝鲜人民会议在七月九日召开了第五次会议，完全通过南北朝鲜民主政党社团指导者协议会的各项决议。它还决定将四月二十八日北朝鲜人民会议特别会议所通过的朝鲜临时宪法立即在北朝鲜实施，并把它送交即将成立的最高人民会议作为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的宪法草案。
    一九四八年八月二十五日南北朝鲜举行了一次全面的民主普选。当时南朝鲜仍在反动派势力压制之下，因此南北朝鲜各政党社团指导者协议会乃决定以不同方式分别在南北两区进行选举。北朝鲜采用直接平等普遍秘密的投票法选举出席最高人民会议的二百一十二位代表，南朝鲜则采用二级间接选举法，由南朝鲜人民先在地下选出南朝鲜人民代表大会的一千零二位代表，再由这些代表选出南朝鲜出席最高人民会议的三百六十位代表。
    选举结果，北部有百分之九九·九八的选民参加投票，南朝鲜也有百分之七七·五二选民参加地下投票。在新选出的五百七十二名议员中，农民占一九四名，工人占一二○名，脑力劳动者占一九二名，商人占二十二名，民族资本家占二十九名，其他成份占十五名。
    九月二日朝鲜最高人民会议在平壤开幕。五天以后它即在北朝鲜人民会议所拟订的宪草之基础上通过了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法。
    新宪法通过后的第二天，最高人民会议即选出常任委员会，以金枓奉为主席。并在金枓奉主席提议之下，任命金日成将军为内阁首相，开始组织新政府。
    九月十二日金日成首相在最高人民会议中发表内阁的施政纲领，指出“要求美苏军队按照苏联的提议立即撤退”是朝鲜谋取统一的基本条件。他宣布南朝鲜傀儡政府及其一切法令为非法，力言朝鲜将与一切爱好和平尊重朝鲜自由独立的国家维持稳固而友好的关系，并极力反对美帝之扶持日本东山再起。最后他宣称，北朝鲜将巩固自己的国防，加强人民的军队，以保卫朝鲜人民的祖国。
    不久，苏联政府即应朝鲜最高人民会议的要求宣布自北朝鲜撤兵。
    一九四九年一月二十八日朝鲜最高人民会议召开第二次会议，听取政府关于一九四八年经济计划实施情形的总结报告。由于劳动人民的奋斗，金日成将军的正确领导，和国际友人的帮助，朝鲜的经济在一九四八年有了长足的发展。
    最高人民会议接受了一九四八年经济计划的总结报告，并着手制订一九四九——五○的北朝鲜人民经济发展计划。二年经济计划在经济建设方面的主要内容：（以一九四八年为一百，一九五○年的百分数）
    国营工业总生产量        一九四·一％
    国营工业中之劳动生产率            一三八·二％
    国营工业之生产成本      六三·七％
    谷物收获量              一○七·九％
    棉花收获量              一五九·一％
    水产物收获量            一二四·九％
    铁路运输总量            一五三·八％
    国家及合作社贸易量      一八二·五％
    在经济建设以外，二年经济计划还决定自一九五○年起实行全面的义务教育制，增加小学、中学和大学的学校数与学生数，加强技术教育与成人教育，发展教科书出版、新闻、杂志与电影事业，大量建造医院与疗养院，以及强化防疫保健与社会保险之措施等等。
    二年经济计划通过后不久，金日成首相即赴苏联访问，与苏联政府签订了苏朝经济文化合作协定，且根据该协定而成立了苏朝关于交换商品、贷款、技术援助与文化交流等四个协定。这对于二年经济计划的顺利完成有着莫大的帮助。
    接着南北朝鲜的政党社团为了加强彼此的团结以争取国家的迅速统一与经济文化建设的顺利发展，又于去年六月二十五日在平壤成立了全朝鲜民主祖国统一战线。参加这一祖国战线的有南北两区的七十一个民主政党与社团。它们选出了一个九十九人的中央委员会，再由该中央委员会产生一中央书记局，作为整个统一战线的最高指导机关。第一任的书记局委员是金日成首相金枓奉主席与朴宪永副首相等。
    去年三月、十一月与十二月北朝鲜还曾分别举行了道市郡区人民委员会、里人民委员会、和面人民委员会的三次选举。这三次选举中一些重要数字列表如下：各级人民委员会      投票比例      议员总数    工人议员数  农民议员数  妇女议员数道市郡区人民委员会  九九·九八％  五八五三    一五四九    二二五九    八六九里人民委员会        九九％        五六一一三  二七八○    五一四七一  八四九四面人民委员会        九八·九％    一三三五四  一五七二    九三三七    二一四六
    去年年底，二年经济计划的第一年度预定数目均已超额完成，今年初的内阁会议上不得不根据朝鲜人民的普遍要求而进一步提高二年经济计划的目标。
    由于经济建设的蓬勃发展，劳动人民的物质生活水准也就不断提高。如果将今年上半年与一九四六年相比，工人工资增加了百分之八十，而物价却反而跌落了一半。这种物质生活水准的不断提高，必然产生劳动人民对于文化的强烈要求。因此朝鲜政府除了极力加强各种文化活动以外，又于今年一月由最高人民会议颁布“关于实施全般初等义务教育的法令”，要在今年秋天使一百五十万北朝鲜学龄儿童全部就学。
    现在朝鲜人民军正在迅速南下，使北朝鲜的各种民主改革得以在南朝鲜的解放区一一实施。我们相信在不久的将来，全朝鲜的三千万人民即将在祖国自由的疆土上，享受民主的幸福了。
