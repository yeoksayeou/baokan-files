    League Members Play an Active Role in Various Tasks
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch] The National Rural Youth Work Conference of the China New Democratic Youth League Central Committee opened in the capital on the 21st. Participating in the conference were 73 leading cadres from the youth league work committees of major administrative regions, provinces, and cities across the country, as well as secretaries of youth league committees from prefectures, counties, and districts with a good work foundation. The central task of the conference is to discuss and determine the working principles and tasks of the rural youth league.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch] Since the establishment of the China New Democratic Youth League in rural areas of the old liberated areas such as Northeast, North China, East China, and Northwest, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, it has achieved great success. As of April this year, according to incomplete statistics, the Youth League has developed 975,628 members in the vast rural areas of the old liberated areas. Youth League organizations have been universally established in provinces, counties, and most districts and townships of the old liberated areas. The Youth League has played a significant and active role in various tasks. According to statistics from five counties in North China and Northeast China, 87% of rural youth league members participated in labor mutual aid groups in the production movement. In Yangcheng County, Shanxi, 35% of the league members in labor mutual aid organizations were elected as group leaders. In Helong County, Jilin, 90% of the league members participated in cooperatives. In Chahar South, most of the labor mutual aid groups were first organized by league members who assisted the government in uniting young people. Rural youth league members are even more active in accepting and promoting new farming methods and using new agricultural tools. Statistics from 27 counties in Hebei show that youth league members played a significant role in completing and exceeding cotton planting tasks. In Ding County Prefecture alone, 380 league members were rewarded by the government for this. Young people and youth league members account for a large proportion of heroes and role models in various fields such as agriculture, water conservancy, afforestation, and disaster relief. In the Subei Yi River Diversion Project, statistics from only three counties showed that 2,687 young people were commended, including 1,471 youth league members. At present, the amateur cultural education movement in rural areas of the old liberated areas is mainly based on young farmers. During last year's winter school movement, young people accounted for about 70% of the total number of students, and this year, young students account for 80% of the people's schools. Excellent league member representatives participate in the political power and people's representative conferences. Youth league members are the backbone of the militia. Many league members, after being educated by the league and tested by land reform and the production movement, have honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party. According to statistics from Liaodong, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Chahar provinces in April alone, 9,662 rural youth league members became members of the Chinese Communist Party.
