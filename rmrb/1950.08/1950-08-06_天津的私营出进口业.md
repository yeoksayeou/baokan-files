Tianjin's Private Import and Export Industry
　　Qing Liu
　　
    A General Overview of Development Over the Past Year

    In 1949, North China's foreign trade overcame various difficulties and rapidly recovered and developed. A large amount of exportable native products accumulated domestically were exported. This was mainly due to the active promotion of the foreign trade policy of "encouraging exports and restricting imports" and "independence and autonomy." On the other hand, it was also the result of the united cooperation and efforts of all public and private import and export companies, national foreign trade departments, and national banks in supporting exports. In Tianjin City, the number of private import and export businesses, including merchants and foreign import and export traders, reached 556 in 1949. There were also 163 private import and export companies from the East China region that established branches in Tianjin. In total, there were 719 companies, more than double the number of import and export businesses before liberation. This formed an unprecedentedly prosperous state of foreign trade in Tianjin.
    
    Two Different Operating Methods, Two Different Outcomes

    Why is it that a small number of import and export businesses in Tianjin are closing down today? Some people have said that the main reason is that the government has not handled the relationship between public and private sectors well, or that state-owned trade has developed too quickly, making it impossible for private import and export trade to develop. Obviously, this statement does not conform to the facts. Because North China's foreign trade has not only not retreated in 1950, but on the contrary, it is more visibly active than before (and even more active than before liberation). In the first four months of this year, the total export value of private merchants was more than 71% of the total export value of private merchants in the past ten months. If we compare the average monthly values, the average monthly import and export value of private merchants in the first four months of this year exceeded the average monthly import and export value of private merchants in the past ten months by 50%. In terms of exports, the average monthly value of private merchants this year has increased by more than double compared to last year. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the actual monthly export volume in North China was only 2.5 million US dollars, and there was no profit to speak of. Comparing the current situation with that period, it is truly incomparable. Since the beginning of this year, the business of trading firms that are operating properly has been flourishing and developing day by day. For example, the China Development Company's export value in the first four months of this year alone exceeded the entire year of last year by 34%. During the same period, Jiancheng Company exceeded it by more than four times. During the same period, Yuanxing Carpet Factory's export quantity of carpets also exceeded the entire year of last year by more than 20%. In addition, according to a survey by the Tianjin Import and Export Chamber of Commerce, during the period from April to the first half of May alone, "Jiancheng" made a net profit of more than 1.003 billion yuan, "Hengtong" made a net profit of more than 690 million yuan, "Yiji" made a profit of more than 206 million yuan, and "Xinglong" made a net profit of more than 180 million yuan. Trading firms such as "Xinhua," "Minsheng," and "Nanchao" also profited a lot. In particular, Hengtong Company's operating capacity has expanded three times since liberation more than a year ago.

    So, why have the businesses of most private import and export merchants developed, while a small number have closed down? These closed-down import and export merchants fall into four different categories:

    The first type is due to the fact that they have always been greedy for huge profits from imports and blindly engaged in barter trade for exports, resulting in exchange losses and bankruptcy. After liberation, the government put forward the foreign trade policy of "encouraging exports and restricting imports." However, some traders, seeing that the profit from imports was high at that time, competed to engage in barter trade in order to seek huge profits from imports. They had no plans for domestic operations, and they did not hesitate to sell at reduced prices abroad. As a result, not only did they harm the foreign market for native products, but the result of selling at reduced prices inevitably led to exchange losses. In 1949, due to the higher profits from imports, they were generally able to maintain themselves. However, after prices generally stabilized and fell in 1950, the prices of imported goods fell steadily, and it even became a phenomenon that they would rather lose money than not be able to sell. As a result, some traders with weak capital who usually relied on borrowing money to do business had to go bankrupt.

    The second type is due to hoarding and speculation, failing to change the past practice of speculating and seizing huge profits, resulting in bankruptcy. For example, when a certain company settled accounts in 1949, its assets and liabilities offset each other. Although it did not do business in the first four months of 1950, it still lost more than 500 million yuan, which shows that it was entirely due to the depreciation of inventory and the continuous increase in interest burden.

    The third type is due to poor management, insufficient cost accounting and careful calculation, which often leads to waste in operation and management, directly increasing export costs. In addition, some traders mainly engaged in imports in the past. Today, when import operations are unfavorable and they want to switch to export operations, they realize that they lack export experience and have difficulty selling goods, so they have to stop operating.

    The fourth type is due to unsound organization, huge expenses, and very weak capital strength. Once they encounter difficulties, their funds become inflexible and they close down. Most of these traders have very little capital, not even enough for a single transaction, so they have to borrow money from private firms. However, once they encounter unexpected events or operational losses, the firms demand repayment, and the funds cannot be circulated. For example, Yitong Trading Company suffered a loss due to a fire on a ship carrying a batch of exported agaric, so it was unable to operate a second batch of business and closed down.

    There are also many traders with unsound organizations, formed by only three or five people, and lack of experience in import and export. Some also have insufficiently streamlined personnel, large expenses, and unclear internal public and private affairs, and even have colleagues operating their own businesses, with profits going to themselves and losses to the public. Under the condition of stable prices, all of these are enough to affect normal and reasonable business operations, and ultimately they can only go bankrupt.
  
    Should be good at using favorable conditions to develop business

    Today's import and export industry, although it is also in difficulties, also has the following favorable conditions:

    First, stable prices and stable exchange rates are extremely conducive to export operations. In the past, when operating exports, often when negotiating with foreign countries, domestic costs had already risen, affecting exports, and there were often cases where it was expected to make money but the results could not be profitable. In the future, with stable prices, we can effectively grasp costs, and there is no such worry. At the same time, under the condition of a certain profit, we can try our best to respond to foreign orders, thereby expanding operations. Therefore, some traders said: "In the past, I wanted to develop but did not dare to develop. Today, it is different. I can boldly and wholeheartedly compete for prices and respond to foreign orders."

    Second, the government vigorously supports import and export trade. In terms of exports, such as reducing freight rates for certain export goods, giving priority to loading and transportation, allowing the import of raw materials needed for exports, and providing a series of loan assistance from the national bank from procurement in the place of origin to processing and packaging at the port, the China Bank's export loans from January to May this year amounted to more than 370 billion yuan, of which private enterprises accounted for more than 90%. Under the leadership of the Municipal Finance and Economic Committee, export groups of various industries were organized, and the government called for the implementation of the spirit of giving consideration to both public and private interests. In terms of imports, such as tax-free cotton imports and appropriate approval of foreign exchange by foreign trade management agencies, all indicate that the government has used great efforts to promote mutual assistance between urban and rural areas and internal and external exchanges, and at the same time, it has supported and encouraged the development of private import and export industries in accordance with the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests. In addition, the continued development of transportation, the independent and autonomous customs management and commodity inspection, etc., are also very conducive to the development of foreign trade.

    Third, interest rates are reduced and costs are reduced. After liberation, the highest loan interest rate in Tianjin was 90% per month, and now it has been reduced to 5%, which is 17/18 lower than the highest rate. This greatly reduces the burden of interest in the cost of traders.

    Since the import and export industry has the above-mentioned superior objective conditions, the main problem in the future is how to be good at using these favorable conditions subjectively to operate and develop business. First of all, we should recognize the policy and promote exports in accordance with the government's correct policy of "encouraging exports and restricting imports," while imports should be operated according to the needs of production and construction. Although foreign trade in 1949 was in surplus, the export quantity of most native products was still far from the level of 1936. This shows that the export trade still has a bright future, so all traders should assist the government in promoting exports in a planned way. Secondly, public and private import and export enterprises should further improve the relationship between public and private sectors, "divide labor and cooperate, each gets what it deserves," and strive to achieve unity and cooperation between public and private sectors, so as to concentrate efforts and unite against the outside world. Over the past year, facts have initially proved that all import and export enterprises that are closely united around state-owned institutions have achieved significant development in their business. Thirdly, it is also very important to improve quality and strive for foreign markets. Only by improving the quality of exported native products can we consolidate foreign markets. For example, Yuanxing Carpet Factory in Tianjin never exports inferior products and has gained a good reputation in foreign markets, so its foreign sales have been greatly developed. At the same time, we must also strengthen investigation and research, pay attention to the dynamics of domestic and foreign markets at any time, and conduct planned exports to avoid blindly competing with each other. We should also formulate our own business plans on a yearly, quarterly, and monthly basis according to the supply and demand, prices, funds, and other aspects, and then proceed step by step according to the plan. Finally, we should pay special attention to careful calculation, save expenses, and strengthen the management of enterprises, so as to minimize avoidable waste in the operation process and reduce costs.

    By doing so, the development of the import and export industry is promising.

　　天津的私营出进口业
    青流
    一年来的发展概况
    一九四九年华北的对外贸易曾战胜了各方面的困难，迅速地恢复和发展。积压国内的大量的可以出口的土产已经输出。这主要是“奖出限入”、“独立自主”的对外贸易政策起了积极推动作用。另一方面，也是全体公私出进口同业，国家对外贸易部门和国家银行团结合作、努力经营及扶持出口的结果。天津市私营出进口业在一九四九年一年间，客商及外商出进口商已达五百五十六家；华东区，私营出进口商来津设立分支机构的也有一百六十三家。合计共七百一十九家，超过解放前出进口商家数一倍以上。这就形成了天津对外贸易空前繁荣的状态。
    两种经营方法两种不同结果
    为什么天津出进口业在今天有一小部分会歇业倒闭呢？有些人曾经说主要原因是政府在公私关系上掌握的不好；或者说是由于国营贸易发展太快，使私营出进口贸易无法发展。显然地，这种说法是不符合事实的。因为，华北的对外贸易进入一九五○年，不但没有丝毫退缩，相反地，却较前显见活跃（较解放前更为活跃）。今年私商四个月的出口总值就等于去年私商十个月出口总值的百分之七十一强。若以每月的平均数值比较，则今年四个月中，私商每月平均出进口总值超过了去年十个月私商每月平均出进口总值的百分之五十。出口方面今年私商每月平均数值较去年增加一倍以上。在国民党反动统治时期，华北出口数额每月实际数字不过两百五十万美金，而且毫无利润可言。现在和那时期的情况比起来，真是不可同日而语。今年以来，正当经营的贸易厂商，业务正在蒸蒸日上，逐日开展。如中发公司，单是今年一至四月份，出口总值就超过去年全年的百分之三十四；同时期建城公司更超过四倍以上；源兴地毯厂同时期出口地毯数量也超过去年全年达百分之二十以上。另外，据天津市出进口商业同业公会调查，仅四月到五月上半月期间，“建城”即获纯利十亿零三千余万元；“亨通”获纯利六亿九千余万元；“义记”获利二亿零六百余万元；“兴隆”获纯利一亿八千余万元。“鑫华”、“民生”、“南侨”等贸易行都得利很多，尤其是亨通公司，在解放后一年多期间，经营能力较前已扩充了三倍。
    那么，为什么大部分私营出进口商的业务有了发展，而一小部分则歇业倒闭呢？这些歇业倒闭的出进口商有四种不同类型：
    第一种，是由于过去一贯贪图进口暴利，盲目易货出口，以致亏汇倒闭的。解放后，政府曾提出“奖出限入”的对外贸易政策。但一部分贸易商以当时进口利润较大，便竞相经营易货图谋进口暴利。在国内经营既无计划，在国外更不惜削价脱售。结果不仅仅是有害于土产的国外市场，同时削价抛售的结果，必然发生了亏汇现象。一九四九年因进口利润较高，一般尚能维持。但进入一九五○年物价普遍稳落以后，进口货价节节下跌，甚至形成了宁愿赔钱也卖不出去的现象。于是资金薄弱，平时靠借钱做生意的一些贸易商，不得不走向垮台一途。
    第二种，是由于囤货居奇，不改过去投机攫取暴利的作风而倒闭的。如某公司在一九四九年结账时资金负债相抵，一九五○年四个月虽未做生意，但也亏损五亿余元，这说明了完全是由于存货跌价，负担利息不断增加所致。
    第三种，是由于不善经营，对于核算成本和精打细算做的不够，以致在经营和管理中往往形成靡费，直接增多了出口成本。此外，有的贸易商在过去主要是经营进口。今日进口经营不利，想转营出口时，才感觉到出口经验不足，有货不好卖，于是只好停业。
    第四种，是组织不健全，开支庞大，本身资金力量又十分薄弱，一旦遇到困难，资金即陷周转不灵而歇业。这一种贸易商大部资金很少，甚至尚不足一笔生意的成交量，不得不向私营行庄借款。但是，一旦遇到意外或经营上的损失，行庄催款，资金便无法周转。如义通贸易行即因出口木耳一批，由于轮船失火受到损失，遂无力经营第二批生意而停业。
    还有不少贸易商组织不健全，仅仅由三、五人凑成，经营出进口经验不足。也有的人员不够精简，开支较大，内部公私不分，甚至有同人各自经营，有利归己，损失归公的情形。在物价稳定的情况下，所有这些都足以影响着正常合理的经营业务，最终便只有走向垮台。
  应善于运用有利条件发展业务
    今天的出进口业，虽然也处在困难中，但同时也具备了以下的有利条件：
    一、物价稳定，外汇牌价平稳，极有利于经营输出。过去经营出口，正在与国外洽商时，往往国内成本又已上涨，影响输出，并常有预计赚钱而结果不能获利的情形。今后物价稳定，可以切实的掌握成本，自无此种顾虑。同时，在有一定利润的条件下，可以尽量向国外应货，从而扩大了营运，因而有的贸易商说：“过去想发展而不敢发展，今天就不然了，可以大胆地专心向国外争价和应货。”
    二、政府大力扶持出进口贸易。在出口方面，如对若干出口物资的减低运费，优先装运，允许出口需用的原料进口，国家银行从产地采购到口岸加工、打包一系列的贷款扶助，中国银行今年一至五月份的出口贷款，就有三千七百余亿元，私营占百分之九十以上。在市财委会领导下组织了各业输出小组及政府号召贯彻公私兼顾精神等；在进口方面，如棉花免税进口，对外贸易管理机关的适当批汇等，都表示着政府在促进城乡互助，内外交流上用了很大的力量，同时也本着公私兼顾的原则扶持和鼓励了私营出进口业的发展。此外，交通事业的继续发展，海关管理及商品检验的独立自主等，也都十分有利于发展对外贸易。
    三、利息降低，成本减轻。解放后，津市贷款利息最高曾达月息九十分，现在降到五分，较最高时降低了十八分之十七，如此便大大减轻了贸易商成本中利息的负担。
    既然出进口业具有着上述优越的客观条件，因此今后的问题主要是在于主观上如何善于运用这些有利条件去经营和发展业务。首先，应认清政策，本着政府“奖出限入”的正确政策去推动出口，而进口则应视生产建设之需要来经营。一九四九年的对外贸易虽是出超，但大部土产之出口数量，尚距一九三六年水平甚远。这表示了出口贸易还有光明的前途，因而所有贸易商应有计划地协助政府推广输出。其次，公私出进口业，应进一步搞好公私关系，“分工合作，各得其所”，争取做到公私团结合作，以集中力量，一致对外。一年来，事实已初步证明了凡是紧紧团结在国营机构周围的出进口业，其业务都已获得了显著的开展。再次，提高品质，争取国外市场，也是十分重要的。惟有提高出口土产品质，才能巩固国外市场。如津市源兴地毯厂，由于次货从不出口，在国外市场得到了很好的信誉，所以国外销路曾获得很大开展。同时还要加强调查研究，随时注意国内外市场动态，进行有计划的出口，以避免盲目地自相竞争。并应根据供求、价格、资金等各方面，逐年、逐季、逐月拟订出自己的经营计划，然后依照计划，按步前进。最后，应特别注意精打细算，节省开支，加强企业化的管理，以尽量减少经营过程中可以避免的浪费而减低成本。
    这样做，出进口业的发展就是有希望的。
