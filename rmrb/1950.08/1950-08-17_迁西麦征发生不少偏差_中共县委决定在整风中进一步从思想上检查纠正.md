　　Qianxi Wheat Collection Suffered Numerous Deviations
    CCP County Committee Decides to Further Ideologically Examine and Correct During Rectification Campaign
    [Our Newspaper, Qianxi] The Qianxi (newly established county in western Qian'an) CCP County Committee of Hebei Province, in summarizing this year's summer grain collection work, reviewed the bureaucratic and commandist work styles of cadres, and proposed to further examine and correct them in the rectification movement.
    Qianxi's summer grain collection this year has achieved certain results. Through the efforts of leaders and cadres at all levels and the enthusiastic payment of the masses, 170,000 catties of the county's summer grain collection task had been completed and entered the county granary by July 25th, and most of the rest had also entered the village granaries. However, in the specific implementation of the task, several errors and deviations were made. For example, after the wheat collection quotas were distributed, it was generally found that the number of mu assigned was more than the actual number of mu planted by farmers, sometimes even two-thirds or one-half more. This was because during the spring planting, the superiors called for planting more wheat fields, and the district and village cadres falsely reported upwards. For example, in Xituantougang Village in the Sixth District, the original report was 642 mu, but after investigation, only 296 mu were actually planted. In addition, most areas of the county did not implement the policy of assessing and collecting based on actual yields, but rather adopted an average apportionment method. Some even apportioned it according to population or land area, regardless of whether the masses planted wheat or not. According to statistics, among the 61 wheat-collecting villages in the Sixth District of the county, only 10 villages followed the policy. Furthermore, in some villages, in order to make up the number of mu assigned by the superiors, they forcibly increased the wheat yield for collection, causing great dissatisfaction among the masses. There was also the case of Chen Guangyu, the county Public Security Bureau chief, who used binding methods to force the masses to hand over wheat when carrying out summer grain collection in Dongzhai.
    The main reason for these deviations is that many county and district cadres did not study and research the policies well and grasp the specific situation. They often simply assigned the tasks; and in the course of work, they did not pay attention to inspection, or even if they did inspect, it was perfunctory and they could not discover problems according to the policies. For example, during the summer grain collection, comrades such as Zhao Qilai from the Sixth District worked hard in the villages every day to inspect the work. The whole process was like this: they asked, "How is your village's public grain collection going?" As long as they answered, "We are working on it," they would turn around and leave. When village cadres inquired about policies, because they themselves did not understand them very well, they would answer, "You should act according to the announcements." This kind of simplistic and bureaucratic working method naturally could not solve any practical problems, and only further encouraged the blindness of village cadres' work, preventing them from doing things well according to the policies.
    After the county leadership discovered the above deviations, they have been constantly paying attention to correcting them, and some comrades have also made self-criticisms, but they have not been completely resolved. The county CCP committee decided to use these errors and shortcomings as the starting point for criticism and self-criticism in this rectification movement, combine them with the local specific conditions, carefully study the rectification documents, and conduct a more in-depth ideological examination in order to overcome shortcomings and correct errors.

　　迁西麦征发生不少偏差
    中共县委决定在整风中进一步从思想上检查纠正
    【本报迁西讯】河北省迁西（迁安西部新设县）中共县委，在总结今年夏征工作中，检讨了干部的官僚主义和命令主义作风，并提出要在整风运动中进一步检查纠正。
    迁西今年夏征是有一定成绩的，全县十七万斤夏征任务，经过各级领导及干部努力，群众的热烈缴纳，至七月二十五日已完成入县库十二万斤，其他也大部入了村库。但在具体执行任务中，却犯了若干错误和偏差。如麦征数布置下去后，普遍发现布置亩数比农民实种亩数多的现象，有的甚至多三分之二或二分之一。这是由于在春种时，上级号召多种麦田，区、村干部便向上虚报所致。如六区西团头岗村，原报六百四十二亩，经调查只实种二百九十六亩。又该县大部分地区皆未按实际产量评订征收的政策执行，而是采取平均摊派办法。有的甚至不管群众种麦与否，也按人口或地亩平均摊派。据统计，该县六区征麦村共六十一个，按政策办事的仅十个村。还有的村，因为要凑足上级布置的亩数，便硬提高麦产量征收，引起群众极大的不满。还有如县公安局长陈光宇，在东寨进行夏征时，有一次曾用捆绑办法逼群众交麦。
    以上这些偏差产生的原因，其中最主要的，是有好些县区干部未很好学习研究政策并具体掌握情况，常常将任务简单化的布置下去；在工作过程中，又不注意检查，即或检查，也是形式主义的不能根据政策去发现问题。如夏征进行中，六区赵起来等同志，每天辛辛苦苦到村检查工作。整个过程是这样：问：“你村公粮怎样搞的？”只要回答一声：“正干呢”。于是转身就走。遇到村干部询问政策时，因为自己也不很懂，便回答：“你们按布告办事吧”。这种简单化的官僚主义的工作方法，自然不能解决任何实际问题，只有更助长村干部工作的盲目性，不能很好的按政策办事。
    该县领导上发现以上偏差后，曾不断注意纠正，有的同志也已作了检讨，但仍未能彻底解决。该县县委决定在此次整风运动中，启发大家将这些错误和缺点作为批评和自我批评的开端，结合当地具体情况，精读整风文件，进行更深入的思想检查，以克服缺点，纠正错误。（迁西县委书记魏建华、通讯员赵亚中、唐山地委宣传部赵英）
