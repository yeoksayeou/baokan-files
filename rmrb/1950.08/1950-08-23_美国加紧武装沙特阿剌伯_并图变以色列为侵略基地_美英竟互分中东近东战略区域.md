Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, August 17th (TASS dispatch): The Syrian newspaper "Al-Zahra" recently published an article entitled "Saudi Arabia is Being Turned into an American Military Base." The author of the article emphasized that the Washington government is stepping up the arming of Saudi Arabia, preparing it to engage in aggressive wars. The $15 million loan given by the United States to the rulers of Saudi Arabia will be used to build airports, military ports, highways, and arsenals.

Another Syrian newspaper, "Al-Baath," pointed out that Saudi Arabia has become the center of American influence in the Near East.

Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, August 17th (TASS dispatch): According to a New York-based reporter for "Al-Hamishmar," during recent negotiations between representatives of the Israeli government and U.S. State Department officials, it became clear that American loans to Israel had definite political objectives. The reporter pointed out that the demand to "turn Haifa into a military base and a spearhead for attacking the Soviet Union" was a major condition for accepting U.S. loans. The purpose of granting this new loan is to realize America's military and political plans in this part of the world, which include: "expanding the port of Haifa, reconstructing and expanding the airport network, and improving Israel's transportation and roads in accordance with the military strategic plans of the Atlantic Pact signatory countries (i.e., building the section of the Istanbul-Cairo highway that passes through Israeli territory)."

Xinhua News Agency, Tel Aviv, August 16th (TASS dispatch): "Al-Hamishmar" newspaper's London correspondent reports: Britain intends to turn Gaza City, currently occupied by Egyptian troops, into a British military base. It plans to transfer a British army unit from the Suez Canal Zone to the Gaza City area. According to the correspondent, this plan was formulated in accordance with the overall plan of the military staff of the Atlantic Group countries to divide the Near East and Middle East into strategic zones for Western countries. Each country will be assigned a specific region. The United States will be assigned a region including Greece, Turkey, and Iran, while Britain will be assigned the Arab countries.

　　美国加紧武装沙特阿剌伯  并图变以色列为侵略基地
    美英竟互分中东近东战略区域
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社大马士革十七日讯：叙利亚《扎拉报》顷发表一文，题为“沙特阿剌伯正在被变成美国的军事根据地”。该文的作者强调说：华盛顿政府正在加紧武装沙特阿剌伯，准备使其从事侵略战争。美国给与沙特阿剌伯统治者们的一千五百万美元的贷款，将用在建筑飞机场、军港、公路和兵工厂上面。
    另外一家叙利亚报纸《巴斯报》指出：沙特阿剌伯已经变成美国在近东的势力中心了。
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社特拉维夫十七日讯：据“阿尔·加米希马报”驻纽约记者报道，在以色列政府代表与美国国务院官员最近举行谈判时，明显地看出美国人贷款给以色列带有确定的政治目的。该记者指出，关于“将海法变为军事基地和进攻苏联的矛头”的要求，是接受美国贷款的主要条件。借予这笔新贷款的目的，就是要在世界的这一部分实现美国的军事政治计划，这个计划便是：“扩大海法港，改建和扩充机场网，并按照大西洋公约签字国的军事战略计划改善以色列的交通工具与道路（即建筑伊斯坦堡至开罗的公路线中经过以色列国境的一段）。”
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社特拉维夫十六日电：“阿尔·哈米斯马尔”报驻伦敦记者报道：英国有意将现由埃及军队占领着的加萨城变为英国的军事基地。它打算从苏彝士运河区调一部英国军队到该城地区来。据该记者称，这个计划是按照大西洋集团各国军事参谋部关于将近东与中东瓜分为西方国家之战略区的总计划而拟订的。每一国家将分配一个确定的地区。美国分得包括希腊、土耳其与伊朗在内的地区，英国则分得阿剌伯国家。
