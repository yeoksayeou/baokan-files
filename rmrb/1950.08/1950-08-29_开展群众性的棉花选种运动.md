　　Launch a Mass Cotton Seed Selection Campaign
    Industrial Raw Materials Department, Central Ministry of Agriculture

    Cotton is a crop that easily cross-pollinates and mixes, and the masses have not historically had the habit of selecting cotton seeds. Therefore, current cotton seeds are mixed and degraded, and grow unevenly, which affects yield and quality. To solve this problem, seed selection work must be carried out. Cotton experiment stations and propagation farms in various regions must carry out this work, but more importantly, propaganda and education must be carried out among the masses so that the broad masses and grassroots cadres understand the significance of cotton seed selection, master seed selection techniques, and comprehensively launch a mass seed selection campaign.

    I. Tasks of the Cotton Seed Selection Campaign This Year: 1. This year, a comprehensive publicity campaign should be launched in all major cotton-producing areas for mass seed selection. In all good seed management areas, seed selection should be strictly implemented in the old areas to implement seed preservation requirements; in the new areas, the masses must also be mobilized to select seeds in coordination with the needs of seed preservation, and make certain achievements. In good seed promotion areas and general cotton fields, the new areas and old areas without a seed selection base should focus on promoting this work to lay the foundation for mass seed selection and seed retention. 2. Each province and region should, in accordance with the above principles, and in consultation with relevant departments, formulate a plan and specific implementation methods for this year's cotton seed selection campaign, prepare various publicity and guidance materials, equip key implementation guidance personnel, and organize seed selection work teams. The above tasks should be prepared and deployed before the end of August. Within September, agricultural leading organs must take the launch of the cotton seed selection campaign as one of the central tasks to set off an organized and led enthusiastic mass seed selection campaign. 3. In the seed selection campaign, in conjunction with the plans for next year's cotton production, good seed propagation and promotion, and reducing the proportion of mid-staple cotton, districts and above should be required to formulate specific seed selection plans, and according to needs, organize seed retention and exchange in a planned way and carry out necessary allocation to properly solve the problem of preparing cotton seeds for next year.

    II. Cotton Seed Selection Work.

    1. Field Selection: The mass seed selection work must be based on field seed selection. Before the cotton bolls open, select seeds in the field based on the conditions of cotton plants, plant shapes that meet the characteristics of the variety, and vigorous growth. Different methods can be used depending on the quality and mixing degree of cotton fields. In high-quality cotton seed breeding areas, where there are few mixed and inferior plants, the method of removing mixed, inferior, and diseased insect plants can be used to retain seeds from the entire field (or separate flowers from mixed and inferior plants during harvest). In areas where high-quality cotton seeds have been promoted in the past, but the fields are quite mixed, or some are good cotton fields, select a part of the better areas in the field according to the characteristics and growth of the good seeds, carry out impurity removal and inferiority removal, and implement partial seed retention (or called piece selection) or adopt the method of selecting good and dividing picking. In order to be easily identified during harvesting, simple and obvious boundaries or signs should be made for the selected good cotton areas or cotton plants; in general ordinary cotton areas where there is no good seed promotion, organize the masses to conduct field evaluation in units of townships or villages, and evaluate better cotton fields according to the conditions of vigorous growth, neatness, no diseases and insect pests, early maturity, and high yield, and carry out selective picking, so that you can improve one step on the original foundation, and may be able to find local good seeds that are suitable for the local soil and climate. In this kind of ordinary cotton area, it is also possible to widely organize and mobilize the masses to take the method of plant selection.

    2. Separate Picking and Ginning: When harvesting cotton from selected cotton fields, cotton areas, or cotton plants, pay attention to separately picking (or use two pockets, or separate sequences, and other effective methods, so as to save labor and achieve the purpose of separate picking) except for the bottom flowers and frost flowers. After picking, they must be dried and stored separately. Full-field seed retention or piece selection should also carry out a seed cotton selection work to check out yellow flowers or stiff petals, etc. Ginning of selected seed flowers must also be carried out separately, which is an important link in cotton seed selection work, and it is necessary to organize processing equipment and strictly implement the work of separately ginning selected seed flowers. In rural areas where there are still many manual cotton ginning machines, they can be well organized to undertake this task. In areas where there are no such conditions, a part of the cotton ginning machines should be specially allocated by state-owned or special cotton ginning mills to gin flowers separately for the masses. Seed cotton should also be sold separately, and purchasing agencies should give higher prices to this kind of good cotton, so that cotton farmers can be compensated for the labor and cost of selecting seeds, dividing harvesting, and removing stiff petals, and implement separate storage and ginning, and then lend or allocate this good seed to the masses for planting.

    3. Self-Retention and Exchange: It is relatively simple and easy for the masses to select a few cotton seeds for self-retention by selecting individual plants in the field. For selecting self-retained seeds, it is necessary to implement single-plant selection in the field, and pick the sprayed flowers, and store and gin them separately. In areas where there is already a good seed foundation, self-retaining seeds can be universally implemented, which is an important link in consolidating the promotion foundation and maintaining good seeds and improving good seeds. In addition, in areas where improvement agencies are set up to purchase and lend good seeds, the masses should be widely organized to exchange good cotton seeds that have been selected. 4. Screening and Grain Selection: After cotton seeds are selected, retained, or exchanged, the prepared cotton seeds should be screened and grain selected during slack farming seasons. After careful inspection, some of the unsound, damaged, insect-eaten, and various colored and shaped seeds are sieved and selected out to increase the uniformity and plumpness of the cotton seeds. This is a necessary work to improve the specifications and germination ability of cotton seeds.

　　开展群众性的棉花选种运动
    中央农业部工业原料司
    棉花是常异交作物，容易混杂，群众过去没有棉花选种习惯，因而目前棉种混杂退化，生长不齐，影响产量和品质。解决这一问题，必须进行选种工作。对这一工作，各地棉花试验场、繁殖场都要进行，但更重要的是在群众中进行宣传教育，使广大群众及基层干部了解棉花选种的意义，掌握选种技术，全面地开展群众性的选种运动。
    一、今年棉花选种运动的任务：１、今年全国主要棉区，对于群众选种，应进行全面性的宣传号召。全部的良种管理区，老区应严格的实施选种工作，贯彻保种要求；新区亦必须配合保种需要，发动群众选种，做出一定成绩。在良种推广区和一般棉田，新区和没有选种基础的老区，有重点地推进此项工作，打下群众选种留种的基础。２、各省区应根据上述原则，和有关部门联系制订今年棉花选种运动的计划和具体实施办法，准备好各项宣传指导的材料，配备重点实施的指导人员和组织选种工作队。以上的各项工作，要争取在八月底以前准备好并布置下去。九月内农业领导机关须以开展棉花选种运动作为中心任务之一，掀起一个有组织有领导的热烈的群众选种运动。３、在选种运动中，要结合下年棉花生产、良种繁殖推广、减少中棉比重等计划，要求区以上都订出选种具体计划，按照需要，有计划的组织留种换种和进行必要的调配，妥当地解决下年棉种的准备问题。
    二、棉花的选种工作。
    １、田间挑选：群众的选种工作必须建立在田间选种的基础上。于棉花吐絮前以棉棵株式，形状合乎品种特性，生育健壮等条件，在田间进行选种。因棉田优劣，混杂程度不同可采用不同的办法。在优良棉种繁殖区，杂株、劣株很少的田内，可用拔除杂株、劣株和病虫株的办法实行全田留种（或于收获时分摘杂株和劣株之花）。在过去推广过优良棉种的地区，但田内已相当混杂，或有部分是良种的棉田，则根据良种的性状及生育的情况在田内挑选一部分较好的区域，进行去杂去劣，实行局部留种（或称片选）或采用选良分摘的办法。为了收摘时容易辨认，应将已选好之良棉区或棉株，作出简单明显的界限或标志；在一般普通棉区而现无良种推广者，以乡或村为单位组织群众进行田间评选，根据生长健壮、整齐无病虫害、早熟、丰产等条件评选出较好的棉田，进行选良分摘，这样也可以就原有基础提高一步，并可能找出适应当地风土的地方良种。在此种普通棉区内，也可广泛组织动员群众采取棵选的办法。
    ２、分摘分轧：选定的棉田、棉区、或棉株收花时，除脚花和霜花外，要注意和其他棉株分别摘收（或用两个口袋，或分先后次序以及其他有效的办法，以能省工而又达到分摘之目的为最好）。摘收后并要分别晒干，分别保存。全田留种或片选的还应进行一次籽花挑选工作，检出黄花或僵瓣等。选种花的轧花也必须分别进行，这是棉花选种工作的重要环节，必须组织加工设备，严格执行选种花分轧的工作。在乡村尚有不少人力轧花车的地方，可以很好的组织起来担当这一任务，而在无此种条件地区则应由公营的或特约的轧花厂专拨出一部分轧花机替群众分别轧花。出卖籽棉也应分别出售，收购机构应对此种好棉，给以较高的价格，使棉农选种分收多花的工本及剔除僵瓣等所受的损失得到补偿，并实行分存分轧，再将此良种贷放或调剂给群众种植。
    ３、自留互换：群众分别棵选少数棉花自留种，比较简便易行。选自留种要实行田间选单株，并采摘其中喷花，分存分轧。凡已有良种基础的地区，可普遍的实行自留种，这是巩固推广基础和保持良种提高良种的重要环节。此外，在设有改进机构进行收购和贷发良种的地区，要广泛组织群众调换选出的好棉种。  ４、筛选粒选：棉种选好留好或换好以后，在播种前还要利用农闲时间，将所准备好的棉种进行筛选和粒选。经过细密的检查，将一些不饱满的、破坏的、虫蛀的、以及各种杂色、杂型籽筛除和挑选出去，以增加棉种的整齐度和饱满度。这对于提高棉种的规格和发芽能力上是很必要的工作。
