　　Widespread Rectification of Farmers' Associations in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi
    Purging Class Enemies, Continuing to Recruit Members, and Creating Conditions for Land Reform.
    [Comprehensive Report from Our Newspaper] Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are universally rectifying farmers' association organizations to welcome the land reform movement this winter and next spring.

    In Hunan Province, after liberation, farmers have been widely organized through movements such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, and production for disaster relief. According to statistics from late May, among the 14,830 villages in the province, 9,564 villages had established farmers' associations, with over 5,730,000 members. Among the established farmers' association organizations, 20% to 30% were relatively sound, 50% to 60% were not sound enough, and 20% were seriously impure. In Xiangyin County, many landlords, despots, soldiers, ruffians, and former township chiefs organized fake farmers' associations everywhere before the farmers were mobilized, spreading rumors, taking the opportunity to distribute grain, embezzling and wasting resources, and illegally apportioning burdens, causing great dissatisfaction among the farmers. In Zirang Township, Songshan District, Changsha, landlords controlled the farmers' association and refused to reduce rent. In rectifying the farmers' associations, the province generally adopted the method of combining it with central work and mobilizing the masses to re-elect leaders. Many class enemies were purged. Cadres of poor, hired, and middle peasant backgrounds with shortcomings in their work were criticized and educated, and some farmers and impoverished revolutionary intellectuals were recruited into the association.

    Since the Hubei Provincial Farmers' Association issued instructions on rectifying rural farmers' association organizations in June, various regions have successively begun rectification work. The province already has 4 million farmers' association members, but the development of the peasant movement is uneven. Some regions have mobilized the masses well, and the farmers' association organizations are relatively pure. In some regions, the composition is impure, bad elements control the farmers' association, engaging in corruption and embezzlement, and arbitrarily allocating grain and funds. In some regions, the masses have not been mobilized at all. The ferocity of local despots and illegal landlords has not been struck a blow. They manipulate grassroots farmers' associations and political power, and there have even been incidents of active farmers being beaten to death. During the rectification in various regions of the province, landlords, rich peasants, and other undesirable elements who had infiltrated were purged, and new members were recruited, strengthening the ranks of the peasants.

    In Jiangxi Province, after rectifying the farmers' associations, the farmers' awareness has been significantly improved, and they have actively requested to join the association. At the same time, during the rectification process, undesirable elements were purged, and the farmers' association organizations have become purer. Before the rectification, a portion of class enemies had infiltrated the village-level farmers' associations in the province, suppressing farmers and preventing them from speaking out; in the rent reduction movement, they shielded the landlord class; colluded with landlords and local bullies, and extorted the masses. The expulsion of bad elements directly improved the farmers' understanding of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Farmers also trusted the staff more and dared to boldly reflect various materials. They further realized that the farmers' association is their own organization leading farmers to liberation; if the cadres are not good, liberation will be difficult. After the rectification, the farmers' association clarified class boundaries, and farmers knew who could join the association, resulting in a rapid increase in farmers' association members.

    The above provinces are currently continuing to rectify the work of the farmers' associations. In some areas, illegal landlords and undesirable elements are still trying every possible means to hinder the progress of work, even colluding with bandits and conspiring to usurp leadership. In other areas, some cadres have a tendency to take over and do everything themselves, arbitrarily purging, causing anxiety among farmers' association cadres in their work. This should be quickly corrected.

　　湘鄂赣普遍整顿农会
    清洗阶级异己分子，继续吸收会员，为土地改革创造条件。
    【本报综合讯】湖南、湖北、江西等省正普遍整顿农会组织，迎接今冬明春的土地改革运动。
    湖南省农民，在解放后，随着剿匪、反霸、减租、生产救灾等运动，已广泛组织起来。据五月下旬统计，全省一万四千八百三十个村中，已有九千五百六十四个村建立了农会组织；会员达五百七十三万余人。已经建立的农会组织，其中百分之二十至三十较健全，百分之五十至六十不够健全，百分之二十严重不纯。湘阴县不少地主、恶霸、兵痞、流氓、旧乡保长等，在农民还未发动前，到处组织假农会，造谣生事，乘机乱分积谷，贪污浪费，非法摊派等。引起农民极大不满。长沙嵩山区自然乡地主把持农会，拒绝减租。该省在整顿农会中，一般采取了与中心工作结合，发动群众改选领导的办法。不少阶级异己分子被清洗。对工作有缺点的贫、雇、中农成份的干部，则是采取批评教育，并吸收了一部分农民和贫苦的革命知识分子入会。
    湖北各地自六月份省农民协会发出关于整顿乡村农民协会组织的指示以后，即先后开始了整顿工作。该省已有农会会员四百万人，但农民运动发展不平衡。有的地区发动群众较好，农会组织较为纯洁。有的地区则成份不纯，坏分子把持农会，贪污腐化，擅派粮款。有的地区则群众根本未发动起来。恶霸和不法地主的凶焰尚未受到打击。他们操纵基层农会和政权，甚至有打死农民积极分子的事件。该省各地农会在整顿中，清洗了混入的地主、富农及其他不良分子，吸收了新会员，壮大了农民队伍。
    江西省各地整顿农会后，农民觉悟已显著提高，纷纷要求入会。同时在整顿过程中，清洗了不良分子，农会组织已较纯洁。该省村级农会在整顿之前，曾有一部分阶级异己分子混入，压制农民不敢说话；在减租运动中，包庇地主阶级；与地主恶霸相勾结，勒索群众。坏分子的清出，直接提高了农民对共产党与人民政府的认识。农民对工作人员也相信了，敢于大胆反映各种材料。他们并进一步认识到：农会是领导农民翻身的自己的组织；如果干部不好，翻身就困难。农会经过整顿，分清了阶级界限，农民知道了什么人能入会，因而农会会员迅速增加。
    上述各省目前仍继续进行整顿农会工作。部分地区仍有不法地主及不良分子，千方百计地阻碍工作进展，甚至与匪徒勾结，阴谋篡夺领导权。另有部分地区，干部有包办代替现象，任意清洗，引起农会干部工作情绪上的不安。应迅速纠正。
