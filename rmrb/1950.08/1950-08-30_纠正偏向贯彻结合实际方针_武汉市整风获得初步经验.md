(Changjiang Daily News) Wuhan City's rectification movement, after correcting deviations, generally adopted the approach of focusing on summarizing work. Currently, it is in the process of inspection and summarization. When Wuhan City started its rectification campaign in early June, due to unclear leadership ideology, the focus of the rectification was placed on individuals' general ideological style, and excessive emphasis was placed on studying documents, which resulted in many units becoming detached from the masses and detached from reality, and the phenomenon of "open-door rectification." After starting to correct this in mid-July, the rectification in various agencies gradually shifted from general and trivial self-criticism to inspecting and summarizing work. According to the report at the third rectification conference convened by the Wuhan Municipal Committee on August 6, the rectification in various agencies throughout the city has successively turned to the correct path of focusing on summarizing work. The Tax Bureau adopted the method of linking inspection work with individuals, and successively convened symposiums for party member representatives, employee representatives, and section/division chiefs, actively encouraging party members and non-party masses to criticize all aspects of work, and discovered many problems. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is also preparing to conduct key inspections on the work of providing relief to unemployed workers, the textile industry, and the organizational work of the agency. At the same time, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China will soon convene a cadre meeting to report on the work summary of the Municipal Committee, and then convene a city-wide party member representative meeting to discuss and draw conclusions, as a basis for improving the city's leadership work.

Responsible Cadres Take the Lead in Conducting Inspection and Summary Work

Wuhan City has gained several preliminary experiences in this period of the rectification movement: (1) This rectification movement is carried out by adopting the method of inspecting and summarizing work from top to bottom. Therefore, the significance of the leaders taking the lead and personally participating is particularly important. Responsible cadres of the Municipal Tax Bureau, the Bureau of Culture and Education, the General Office of the Municipal Government, and other departments were able to personally make mobilization reports, study rectification methods, and first seriously inspect and summarize the work of their departments. Therefore, the inspection work was smoothly launched. However, the leading cadres of some other departments assigned the rectification task to the branches and did not pay attention to it themselves. Some even mobilized from layer to layer, only rectifying those below. Some emphasized that they were "busy with work" and often did not attend meetings. There were even individual responsible comrades who did not participate in rectification meetings because they were afraid of criticism. Therefore, the rectification in these departments has not been able to develop rapidly and comprehensively.

Humbly Listen to the Opinions of the Masses and Launch Criticism from the Bottom Up

(2) In the inspection and summary work, we must humbly listen to the opinions of lower-level cadres and the masses. Experience has proven that as long as the leading cadres clearly explain the spirit of rectification to the masses and show their sincerity in listening to the criticism of the masses, the masses will dare to express their opinions. The Tax Bureau was initially afraid that the masses would have concerns, so they set up an opinion box, calling on everyone to submit opinions anonymously; however, there were not many opinions. Later, after in-depth mobilization, coupled with the publicity and brewing of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the club in various symposiums, the masses actively put forward their opinions. And they signed and sealed the written opinions they submitted to show that they were serious and responsible. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee also issued a notice soliciting the opinions of the Party organizations of various departments on the Propaganda Department. However, the responsible comrades of some departments did not do so. They felt that the opinions raised by the masses were just "small things" about life attitudes, not issues of principle and policy, so they were unwilling to listen to the opinions of the masses; or they felt that the criticisms from below had some discrepancies with the facts, and perhaps contained some complaints, so they were eager to correct or explain them. In fact, even if some of the opinions of the masses are not entirely correct, we should patiently guide the masses to discover and criticize the main problems, rather than suppress criticism.

Analyze the Situation, Grasp the Core, Find the Reasons, and Solve the Problems

(3) Analyzing the situation, grasping the core, finding the reasons, is the main method of summarizing work. According to the experience of the Municipal Tax Bureau, it is necessary to comprehensively analyze the problems, situations, and opinions raised by the leadership and the masses based on policies and guidelines, and then bring them back to the masses for deliberation and discussion to find the main problems, and then investigate their causes and their essence. To carry out this kind of analysis and summary, it is also necessary to combine it with the study of documents. This analysis process is also the process of improving cadres. However, many units simply collect the opinions of the masses and their own self-criticism, and then simply affirm or deny them; some units list several advantages and disadvantages; some units formulate inspection and research outlines that are all-encompassing; some units simply pick up at will and do whatever they want, thinking that they have found the central problem. Of course, these practices obviously cannot solve any problems.

Inspect Departments Step by Step from Top to Bottom, Connect with Individuals, Correct Styles

(4) In order to achieve the purpose of improving cadres, it is necessary to gradually inspect the work of various departments from top to bottom, and connect with individuals to carry out criticism and self-criticism, and draw conclusions. In the work summary of the Municipal Tax Bureau, in addition to reviewing the grasp of policies and guidelines, it also specifically reviewed the bureaucratic and commanding style of cadres. This was of great help to everyone. Therefore, the three-stage theory of some units of "rectifying cadres above the county and regiment level first, then rectifying party members, and finally rectifying new cadres" is not practical, especially not in line with the requirements of summarizing work. However, some cadres believe that now is just the summary of work, and there is no need to rectify the ideological style of individual cadres any more, which is also wrong.

### 纠正偏向贯彻结合实际方针  武汉市整风获得初步经验

　　纠正偏向贯彻结合实际方针
    武汉市整风获得初步经验
    【本报讯】长江日报消息：武汉市整风运动，在纠正偏向之后，一般的都采取了以总结工作为主。目前正在进行检查和总结工作。武汉市在六月初开始整风时，曾由于领导思想不明确，把整风的重点放在个人的一般思想作风上，并过份地强调了研读文件，致使很多单位发生脱离群众，脱离实际，开门整风的现象。七月中旬着手纠正后，各机关的整风即逐渐地由泛泛琐碎的检讨进入检查总结工作。据八月六日，市委召集的第三次整风会议上汇报：现在全市各机关整风已先后转到以总结工作为主的正确途径。税务局采取从检查工作联系个人的办法，先后召集了党员代表座谈会，职员代表座谈会，科、股长座谈会，积极启发党员与非党群众对各方面工作进行批评，发现了不少问题。市总工会也准备就救济失业工人工作，纺织业工作及机关组织工作诸方面进行重点检查。同时中共武汉市委即将召集干部会议，报告市委工作总结，再召开全市党员代表会议经过讨论，得出结论，以作为改进全市领导工作的根据。
    负责干部亲自动手进行检查总结工作
    武汉市在这一时期整风运动中，已获得几点初步经验：（一）这次整风运动是采取自上而下检查与总结工作的方式来进行的，因之，首长负责亲自动手的意义特别重大。市税务局、文教局、市府秘书厅等部门负责干部都能亲自作动员报告，研究整风方法，并对本部门的工作首先认真地进行检查与总结，因之，使检查工作顺利展开。但另有些部门的领导干部则把整风任务交给支部，自己不去过问。有的甚至层层动员下去，只整下边。有的强调“工作忙”，常常不到会。甚至还有个别负责同志，因为害怕批评竟然不参加整风会议。因而这些部门的整风一直未能迅速全面展开。
    虚心倾听群众意见自下而上展开批评
    （二）在检查总结工作中，必须虚心倾听下级干部和群众的意见。经验证明：只要领导干部把整风的精神向群众交代清楚，表明了听取群众批评的诚意，群众是敢于提意见的。税务局开始怕群众有顾虑，设了一个意见箱，号召大家可以匿名提意见；可是意见并不多。后来经过深入动员；加上党、青年团及俱乐部和在各种座谈会上的宣传酝酿，群众才踊跃地提出了自己的意见。并且在所提的书面意见上签名盖章，表示慎重负责。市委宣传部也发出通知征求各部门党的组织对宣传部的意见。但是有些部门的负责同志并不如此。他们觉得群众提的都是一些生活态度上的“小事”，不是原则方针问题，因此不愿倾听群众意见；或者他们觉得下边的批评与事实有某些出入，也许带有牢骚成份，因而急于纠正或解释。其实，即使群众有些意见不十分正确，也应耐心地引导群众去发现与批评主要问题，而不是压制批评。
    分析情况抓住中心找出原因解决问题
    （三）分析情况，抓住中心，找出原因，这是总结工作的主要方法。根据市税务局的经验，必须把领导方面和群众提出来的问题、情况和意见，根据政策方针加以综合分析，然后再提到群众中去酝酿讨论，找出主要问题，再追究它的原因与它的实质。要进行这种分析总结，还必须结合研读文件。这种分析过程也就是干部的提高过程。但是有很多单位只是把群众的意见和自己的检讨汇集起来，加以可否就算了事；有的单位则是将优点、缺点罗列几条；有的单位拟订检查研究提纲，面面俱到，包罗万象；有的单位则是随手检来，随心所欲，就算找到了中心问题。当然这些作法显然是不能解决什么问题的。
    自上而下逐步检查联系个人改正作风
    （四）为了达到提高干部的目的，必须自上而下逐步检查各部门工作；并联系个人，展开批评与自我批评，作出结论。市税务局的工作总结中，除检讨政策方针的掌握以外，还特别检讨了干部官僚主义、命令主义的作风。这对大家有很大的帮助。因之，有些单位“先整县团以上的干部，再整党员，最后才整新干部”的三阶段论，是不切合实际，特别是不合乎总结工作的要求的。但是有些干部认为现在只是总结工作，不用再整顿干部个人的思想作风，这也是不对的。
