How the French People Conducted the Peaceful Signature Campaign?
By Mogang, Editor-in-Chief of the French magazine "Defend Peace"

Every French person should take a firm stand on the Stockholm Appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons – this is the goal set by the Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom (the French branch of the World Peace Congress) for its current stage. The signature campaign began within weeks after the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. First, we must eliminate some misconceptions among peace advocates. Because in France, not everyone can immediately understand the importance of the Stockholm Appeal. To illustrate this point, consider the following example:

The French working class, especially the most militant among them – the dockworkers – have long resolutely resisted the war in Vietnam and the preparations for war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Some people felt somewhat disappointed when they read the Stockholm Appeal, because the full text of the Appeal did not mention the dockworkers' actions – they believed that it was precisely such anti-war actions that could unite the nation's elite forces. In fact, some even considered this a step backward.

Therefore, we had to explain to them that the rising crisis of aggressive war (many people still underestimate its seriousness) requires peace-loving people to unite on the broadest possible basis; that every honest person, regardless of their profession, political belief, or religious belief, can participate in this movement as long as they are prepared to support the cause of peace, even if they do not fully understand the situation and cannot immediately know where the threat of aggression is occurring.

Now, the fighters for peace and freedom have realized that the heroic struggles of the dockworkers only provide a path for the more active elements to exert their strength and fighting spirit, while uniting the broadest masses of peace advocates with the Stockholm Appeal is both possible and necessary. There are very few people today who doubt that this movement initiated by the Standing Committee will weaken the strength of other anti-war actions, but rather will strengthen them. The millions of men and women who have signed the Stockholm Appeal will certainly not limit themselves to signing – they will participate in other forms of struggle for peace.

The explanatory work carried out by the French peace advocates' organizations along these lines has already yielded results; at the same time, the signature campaign is developing well.

The organization of signature collection is mainly concentrated in the county peace committees established by the Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom. In many parts of France, these committees have been established for quite some time. Surrounding them are district branches and factory branches of the peace committees. The number of these groups is increasing rapidly; the county committees are responsible for coordinating their activities.

For example, in Marseille, in addition to the county committee, there are seventy-seven district branches and factory branches, as well as ship branches of the peace committee. Sète has one county committee, fifteen district branches and factory branches; Calais has one county committee, eleven district branches and factory branches, and so on.

Each province has its liaison committee, responsible for coordinating the work of the county committees, so that they are in constant contact with the headquarters of the peace movement. In addition, the county committees maintain direct contact with the Standing Committee of the Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom in Paris.

In general, this is the organizational form of the French peace movement. In the beginning, the Stockholm signature campaign was organized very imperfectly, but it soon developed into a mass movement, although some organizational shortcomings still need to be overcome. For example, the National Committee of the Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom held a meeting in Paris on June 3rd and 4th, and at that time it was believed that the county peace committee system in rural areas was still not widespread enough, and that the provincial liaison committees did not correctly perform their guiding tasks strongly and comprehensively enough. It was then decided to take various steps to increase the number of rural committees and strengthen the provincial liaison committees.

Every fighter in the peace committees participated in this signature campaign. In many factories, more than 90% of the personnel signed the Stockholm Appeal. Here are some figures: the Ellèche weaving factory in the Toulouse province – 95%; the Balenny-La-Ri electric factory in the Upper Vienne province – 90%, including the factory director; the Social Security Center in the Upper Garonne province – 100%; the Calais-Kau factory in the Lower Quentin province – 98%; the Swiky factory in the Boulogne province – 100%; the Brest railway workshop – 90%; the Lower Yata province automobile factory – 100%; the Dolton railway workers – 98%, and so on.

Every peace fighter in the district committee was assigned to a certain street to canvass door-to-door. This kind of visit was made when people were most likely to be at home, and everyone was asked to sign the Stockholm Appeal; the canvassers used various methods to persuade those who refused to sign for any reason. Some did not need to be persuaded – they signed immediately. Some signed after the canvasser had talked to them several times. Some of the methods created by women were the most effective: they often appealed to mothers. It was common for the whole family to sign the peace declaration.

The signature campaign in the countryside started later, so some results have only been achieved recently. Here is a part of many achievements: In Éricourt in the Seine province, 2,817 out of 2,961 residents signed the Appeal; in Chasse-sur-Rhône in the Isère province, 95% of the residents participated in the signature; in Châteauneuf-du-Pape in the Vaucluse province, virtually everyone signed; in the village of Valliuna-Louya in the Pyrenees province, which was burned down by the Germans, every resident signed the Appeal, and the same is true in many villages in the Corrèze province.

In addition to collecting signatures among ordinary people, peace fighters also asked prominent people from all walks of life to sign. Great achievements have been made in this regard. Among those who supported the Stockholm Appeal were Benoist, an academician of the French Academy, the famous artists Chevalier and Saint-Granier, famous scientists and university professors, sports champions, and high-ranking court officials, including Prosecutor General Mounner and Chief Justice Mengjib.

In addition, two other important facts are enough to illustrate the strength of the French peace movement. The first is that several prominent Catholic leaders have participated in this movement. Among them, Chevalier and many priests personally signed and issued declarations supporting the Stockholm resolution. The second is that all the prominent Protestants have participated in this peace movement.

This attitude of prominent representatives of Catholicism and Protestantism shows that no reason can stop religious figures from participating in the signing of the Stockholm Appeal. The National Committee of the Association for Peace and Freedom recently held a meeting and resolutely condemned the methods used in some places, namely, using other declarations to collect signatures for peace instead of the Stockholm Appeal. This condemnation is correct. The National Committee thoroughly studied this issue and unanimously decided that only signatures for the Stockholm Appeal should be collected in France.

This Appeal has been supported by many elected administrative bodies, including more than one hundred city governments and ten municipal committees. These city governments and municipal committees are composed of people with different political views and different beliefs. And the Stockholm Appeal even received the signatures of two cabinet members of the recently resigned Bidault cabinet – Pishu and Four.

The signatures of many prominent figures and members of elected bodies undoubtedly help to increase the strength of the peace movement, but on the other hand, there is no doubt that the appearance of these signatures is the result of the development of this movement. It is very clear that in places where 90% to 100% of the residents have signed the Appeal, city councilors, mayors, or pastors cannot stand aside. On the contrary, their signatures help to promote the success of the peace movement.

At the time of writing this article, France had collected more than ten million signatures on the Stockholm Appeal. In some provinces, more than 50% of the residents have signed the Appeal. We must do such work and obtain the signatures of those who refused to sign at the first contact. We must go deep into the most remote villages and farms. The Stockholm Appeal must be brought to every family without exception.

This signature campaign is not interfered with by the struggle of workers against the delivery and transportation of arms. In general, the attitude of the dockworkers is firm; if war materials were unloaded at Cherbourg and Toulon several times, it was because a large number of troops and police intervened.

Railway personnel continue to block trains carrying war materials and report their activities to the peace fighters who throw the goods out of the cars. Workers often refuse to work when dealing with war material order forms and tell the residents about the orders they receive as soon as possible. Not long ago, when a factory in the 13th arrondissement of Paris received a batch of arms parts order forms, a disturbance occurred, and the police had to transport the parts away very hastily.

The French working class, which is marching in the forefront of the peace struggle, resists the manufacture and unloading of arms. The increasingly victorious Stockholm Appeal signing movement, the universal response that this signature has aroused among people of all walks of life – all of this has constantly aroused the anger of the French rulers. Peace fighters are suffering all kinds of suppression. Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Congress, has been removed from his position as High Commissioner of the Atomic Energy Commission. Tasi was dismissed from his position as President of the National Academy of Sciences. Several professors known for their peace movement have been forced to resign. The government majority in the parliament has passed a series of severe bills, and many peace fighters have been thrown into prison under these bills.

However, the struggle against the enemies of peace has won powerful development at the same time as the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign is being carried out.

The importance of the Stockholm Appeal on the prohibition of atomic weapons lies in the fact that it unites all those who truly desire peace. We peace advocates are making every effort, regardless of political views and religious beliefs, to unite all honest people in France around the Stockholm Appeal.

　　法国人民是怎样进行和平签名运动的？
    法国《保卫和平》杂志总编辑  摩岗
    每一个法国人都应该在禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上采取坚定的立场——这就是争取和平与自由战士协会（世界和平大会法国分会）所规定的它现阶段的目标。在世界和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议结束以后，不到数星期，签名运动就开始了。首先，我们要在和平拥护者们中间消除某些错误的想法。因为在法国，并不是每一个人都能够立即理解到斯德哥尔摩宣言的重要性的。为了要说明这点，举例如下：
    法国的工人阶级，尤其是其中战斗着的一部分——码头工人——好久以来就坚决反抗着越南战争以及对苏联与各人民民主国家的战争准备。有些人读到斯德哥尔摩宣言就感到几分失望，因为宣言全文中没有提到码头工人的行动——他们相信正是这样的反战行动才能够把全国的精锐力量配合起来。事实上，有些人甚至认为这次是倒退了一步。
    我们因此不得不向他们解释：侵略战争不断高涨的危机（有许多人还在过低估计它的严重性）要求着拥护和平的人们在尽可能广大的基础上团结起来；每一个正直的人，不管他的职业、政治信仰或宗教信仰如何，只要他准备支持和平事业，即使他还没有充分了解情况，不能立即知道侵略威胁发生在那里也罢，他就可以在这个基础上参加这个运动。
    现在，争取和平与自由的斗士们已经觉悟到：码头工人们的英勇斗争仅为比较积极的分子提供了发挥力量与斗争精神的道路，而用斯德哥尔摩宣言来团结最广大的和平拥护者们，是可以而且应该的。那些怀疑到常设委员会所发起的这一运动使其他反战行动的力量，不会减少下去，只有加强起来的人们在今天可就很少了。千百万在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名的男女们一定不会仅限于签名——他们一定会为了和平，参加其他方式的斗争。
    法国和平拥护者们的组织沿着这等方针所进行的解释工作已经有了成绩；同时签名运动也正在好好儿发展着。
    征集签名的组织工作主要集中在争取和平与自由战士协会所成立的各县和平委员会。在法国许多地方，这种委员会成立以来相当长久了。围绕着它们的有和平委员会的区分会和工厂分会。这种团体的数目正在迅速增加；县委员会就有责任来调节它们的活动。
    例如在马赛，除了县委员会，有七十七个区分会和工厂分会，此外还有和平委员会的船上分会。塞特有一个县委员会，十五个区分会与厂分会；加莱有一个县委员会，十一个区分会与工厂分会等。
    每省都有它的联络委员会，负责调节各县委员会的工作，使其与和平运动总部经常保持接触。除此以外，各县委员会还与巴黎的争取和平与自由战士协会常设委员会保持直接的联系。
    总的说来，这就是法国和平运动的组织形式。在最初，斯德哥尔摩签名运动组织得极不完备，但是不久就有了发展，成为群众性的运动，虽然某些组织上的缺点还待克服。例如，争取和平与自由战士协会全国委员会六月三日和四日在巴黎举行会议，当时认为在乡村区域的县和平委员会系统仍旧不够普遍，同时省连络委员会不够强大、不够全面地正确执行其指导的任务。当时曾经决定采取各种步骤来增加乡区委员会的数目并加强省连络委员会。
    每一个和平委员会的斗士们都参加了这签名运动。在许多工厂里，有百分之九十以上人员在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。这里有一些数字：土鲁斯省的艾莱奇缝织工厂——百分之九十五；上维也纳省的巴仑尼拉里电气工厂——百分之九十，其中包括工厂厂长；上加隆省社会安全中心——百分之一百；下昆丁省的加莱考工厂——百分之九十八；布冈省的斯威基工厂——百分之一百；布勒斯特铁路工场——百分之九十；下亚田省汽车工厂——百分之一百；多尔顿铁路工人——百分之九十八等等。
    区委员会的每一个和平斗士都被派到一定的街道上去挨户游说。这种访问是趁人们最可能在家里的时候，并请求每人都在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名；游说者用种种方法来说服那些用任何理由来拒绝签名的人。有的用不着游说——立即签了名。有的要等游说者谈过了几次才签名。有些妇女所创造的方式是最有效的：她们常常向母亲们呼吁。全家人在和平宣言上签名是常事。
    乡村的签名运动开始较晚，因此，最近才做出一些成绩来。这里是许多成绩中的一部分：在塞纳省的爱立考，二千九百六十一个居民中有二千八百十七名在宣言上签了名；在伊塞尔省的赤士凡尔，有百分之九十五的居民参加签名；在瓦克卢斯省的九神父堡，实际上每一个人都签了名；曾经被德国人焚毁的比利牛斯省瓦利纳路亚村，每一个居民都在宣言上签了名，在高莱兹省的许多村庄中也有同样的情况。
    除了在普通人民中间征集签名，和平斗士们还请求各方面知名人士签名。这方面已有很大的成绩。赞助斯德哥尔摩宣言的人们中间有法兰西研究院院士伯诺瓦，著名艺人薛佛立埃和圣格兰尼，著名的科学家与大学教授，运动锦标获得者及高级的法院官员们，其中有检察长蒙纳及高等法院首席院长孟即布。
    另外有两件重要事实足以说明法国和平运动的力量。第一件就是：这个运动已有好些著名的天主教领袖参加，其中雪夫洛和许多教士亲自签名后还发表宣言，赞助斯德哥尔摩决议。第二件就是：全部著名的新教徒都参加了这和平运动。
    天主教与新教的著名代表们的这种态度说明了任何理由都阻挡不住宗教界人士参加斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名。争取和平与自由协会全国委员会最近开会，坚决地谴责某些地方所做的方式，即用其他宣言来为和平征集签名，而不用斯德哥尔摩宣言。这个谴责是正确的。全国委员国透彻地研究了这个问题，一致决定：在法国只为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名。
    这个宣言获得了许多民选的行政机构的赞助，其中包括一百个以上的市政府及十个市政委员会。这些市政府及市政委员会是由不同政治主张及不同信仰的人们所组成的。并且斯德哥尔摩宣言甚至获得了新近辞职的皮杜尔内阁两个阁员——比许及富尔的签名。
    许多知名人士及民选机构的议员的签字无疑地有助于增加和平运动的力量，但在另一方面，这些签名的出现是这个运动发展的结果，这一点也无庸怀疑。十分明显，凡是有百分之九十到百分之一百的居民在宣言上签了名的地方，市议员们、市长或牧师也不能置身度外，相反地，他们的签名帮助促进了和平运动的成功。
    写此稿的时候，法国已征集了一千余万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上的签名。在若干省份里，居民百分之五十以上签署了宣言。我们必须做这样的工作，取得那些在第一次接洽时拒绝签名的人的签名。我们必须深入到极远的乡村和农场里。斯德哥尔摩宣言必须无例外地带到每个家庭里去。
    这个签名运动并不因工人反对交付和运送军火的斗争这一步发展，而受到干涉。在总的方面说来，码头工人的态度是坚决的；如果战争物资好几次在瑟堡和土伦起卸，那么这是因为有大批的军队和警察加以干涉的缘故。
    铁路人员继续拦阻载运战争物资的火车，并把他们的活动情况向那些将货物抛出车外的和平斗士们报告。工人们经常在应付战争物资定货单时拒绝工作，并且尽速地将接到的定货单告诉居民们。不久以前，巴黎第十三区在区内某家工厂收到一批军火零件定货单的时候，发生了骚动，警察不得不十分仓促地运走这批零件。
    正在和平斗争的前列迈进的法国工人阶级对制造及运卸军火的抵抗，签署斯德哥尔摩宣言运动日益高涨的胜利，这个签名在各阶层人民中间所引起的普遍响应——这一切都不断地引起了法国统治者的愤怒。和平斗士们正遭受着各式各样的镇压。世界拥护和平大会主席居里已被撤去了原子能委员会最高委员的职位。塔西被免去了国立科学研究院院长的职位。若干以他们拥护和平运动而闻名的教授们被迫辞职。议会里的政府多数派通过了一系列严峻的法案，许多和平斗士根据这些法案而被投入狱中。
    但是，反对和平敌人的斗争在斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动进行的同时，却赢得了强大的发展。
    关于禁用原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言的重要性在于它团结了一切真正渴望和平的人。我们和平拥护者们正在尽一切的努力，不分政治见解和宗教信仰，把法国所有正直的人民团结在斯德哥尔摩宣言的周围。（盛树人译自《新时代》杂志第二十八期。）
