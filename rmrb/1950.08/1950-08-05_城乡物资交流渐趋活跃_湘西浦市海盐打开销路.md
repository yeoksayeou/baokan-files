　　Urban-Rural Material Exchange Gradually Becomes Active

    Pushi, Xiangxi Opens Sales for Sea Salt
    [Our Newspaper Chenxi News] Since the beginning of July, due to the gradual activation of urban-rural material exchange in Pushi, Xiangxi, sea salt has also opened up sales channels. Local oil prices have improved, and sales are booming. Farmers and merchants have been transporting oil from the countryside. In addition to transactions with private merchants, the Yuanling Special District Trade Company has also been purchasing. In the first ten days of July, it has purchased more than 6,000 jin of tung oil and rapeseed oil, and at the same time, it has promoted more than 8,000 jin of table salt. Local farmers originally only wanted white refined salt and not sea salt. The reason was that in the past, when salt was scarce, the Kuomintang reactionaries mixed sand and gypsum into the salt to make huge profits. Farmers spent a lot of money but could not get good salt. Therefore, they were afraid of being taken advantage of when they saw the black sea salt. After repeated publicity and explanations by the working comrades, the farmers' concerns have been initially dispelled. Moreover, sea salt is cheap, salty, and clean, and it has been welcomed by the farmers.

　　城乡物资交流渐趋活跃
    湘西浦市海盐打开销路
    【本报辰溪讯】湘西浦市七月初以来，由于城乡物资交流渐趋活跃，海盐也打开了销路。当地油价好转，销路畅旺，农民和商贩纷纷从乡下运油，除与私商成交外，沅陵专区贸易公司也进行收购，七月上旬已收购桐油和菜油共六千多斤，同时并推销了食盐八千来斤。当地农民原先只要白淮盐，不要海盐。原因是过去食盐缺少时，国民党反动派在盐内掺石沙、石膏，贪图厚利，农民花了大价钱还吃不到好盐，因此一见到带黑色的海盐就怕吃亏。经过工作同志几番的宣传解释，已初步打破了农民的顾虑。且由于海盐价廉味咸又干净，已受到农民的欢迎了。
