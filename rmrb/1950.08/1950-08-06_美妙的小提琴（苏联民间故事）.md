The Wonderful Violin
    (Soviet Folk Tale)
    Translated by Ulanhan
    In the largest country, in the largest city, in the center of this city, once lived a capable textile worker. She was a widow who had lost her husband, but she had a huge treasure left: seven sons and three daughters.
    Her windows, in the morning not welcoming the sunrise, in the evening not sending off the sunset, are illuminated by the stars of the Kremlin. In fact, she had been to the Kremlin more than once. She had met the leaders there, and they had awarded her medals and awards: because she had many children, because her work was good, and because in her youth she had rendered military service on the battlefields of the domestic war.
    As soon as it dawned, the female weaver got up, and the whole family got up with her. Everyone followed their mother to their posts. Some worked in factories, some studied, and some flew airplanes in the sky. The mother called her sons who were pilots strong eagles, and her assistants, her daughters, rising suns.
    The widow's youngest son was called Vladimir. In order not to fall behind his brothers, in order not to shame his mother, in order to make the Communist Youth League proud of him, Vladimir worked hard at his studies. This young man became good friends with songs. He got up singing songs, and he went to bed singing songs. The streets and parks of Moscow knew Vladimir's pleasant voice. When he sang in his yard, passers-by stopped in front of the door; when he sang in the forest, the trees became silent, and the birds stopped chirping; they were all listening to his singing.
    When he had just turned seventeen, the war began that day.
    The widow's six sons, six pilots, immediately flew to the front like eagles. The three daughters, stayed only one night, and at sunrise, they bid farewell to their mother and went to the front as nurses.
    Only the youngest son, Vladimir, was left with his mother. And on the twelfth day after the war began, Vladimir heard the leader's moving and touching words: "My friends! I am speaking to you..." Stalin's words grabbed Vladimir's heart. He said goodbye to his mother, but didn't say where he was going, and didn't come home that night. On the fourth day, his farewell letter was sent: "Mom, I beg you, don't cry, don't be sad for me. I am going to the front line to fight the villains according to Stalin's words!"
    Time flies, one week after another becomes a month, and one month after another becomes a year. The war spread endless pain on the land of the motherland. The widow rarely received letters from her sons, and the youngest son didn't write at all. The mother always hoped and waited. She waited day after day, week after week, month after month, but no letter came. What to do? Just work harder and put your heart into the work. The widow didn't know sleep - rest, tirelessly weaving cloth, using it to make clothes for her children. She was thinking: "Do I only have ten children? All the people who are there, on the near and far fronts, sacrificing their lives and crushing the enemy, are our flesh and blood children!"
    But the war, like flowing water: although it is blood, it always flows away.
    The heroic soldiers began to return home, and the families were filled with joy. The mother waited for when there would be loud singing in her home.
    Four sons and three daughters returned, and two had given their lives for the motherland. The youngest son was nowhere to be found. The mother was sad, and distressed, really: "Few words, many tears, sad tears like a river, sad tears gather into a bottomless river."
    Time flies, one week after another becomes a month, and one month after another becomes a year. But this year passed like a minute, and at a late night moment, when all the windows of the family looked at the stars of the Kremlin, a soldier walked in, and the mother immediately recognized her youngest son. She threw herself into embracing him, kissed him, and tears of joy flowed. She was confused, no matter what she said, he just stroked her pale hair. He didn't say a word, his brothers happily lifted him up and threw him into the air; he also hugged everyone, but didn't speak. At that time, the family understood that Vladimir was mute. He would never sing again, and from now on no one would ever hear his singing again...
    The female weaver's home was like a garden without nightingales, with both happiness and sorrow: he had returned alive, but there was no singing.
    To celebrate the victory, the great Stalin ordered that tables be set in several halls of the Kremlin, and invited his excellent warriors. The female weaver's family, her sons, all attended that sumptuous banquet, because they had all fought bravely for the motherland. Stalin raised his glass to everyone and asked them to talk about their work in the war zone and the merits they had established. Comrades-in-arms spoke of many brilliant deeds and said many congratulatory words.
    This time, this time it was Vladimir's turn, in front of this young warrior. He stood up and silently gave Stalin a deep bow. And what he, Vladimir, should have said, was said by his combat comrades. They said what a singer he was, how he went to the front singing, how he went out to reconnoiter. They said how he was caught by the fascist devils, and tortured severely, but couldn't get a word out of him. This Soviet soldier answered the torture with a song praising the motherland. It was because of this song, this song that was more terrible than a bullet to the enemy, that his tongue was cut off, and they made him mute. Vladimir escaped from the executioners. Now, his singing has disappeared, but the song lives on, the song wants to tear through his chest, but he can't sing it out.
    Stalin listened to this admirable story, hugged Vladimir, called him a hero because he had merit, and gave him a violin.
    The soldier looked up at Stalin, took the violin, put on the violin bow, and the violin suddenly rang out. It sang in a beautiful voice. Everyone felt that this was not a violin, but Vladimir singing about victory, singing about life, singing about happiness, singing about the great Stalin. The songs that filled Vladimir's chest seemed to burst out arbitrarily. The will to live and joy returned to Vladimir's body. That night, people stood in front of the Kremlin, although they couldn't see it, they heard Vladimir's voice praising the merits of our people and calling for a march towards new victories.
    It is said that now this violin is not only in Moscow, not only in our country, but it is ringing loudly everywhere in the world! It is narrating the great leader, narrating our powerful country, and calling on the world to move towards peace.

　　美妙的小提琴
    （苏联民间故事）
    乌兰汉译
    在最大的国家里，在最大的城市里，在这座城市的中心，曾经住过一位能干的纺织女工。她是丧失了丈夫的寡妇，但是她剩下了巨大的财宝：七个儿子和三个女儿。
    她的窗户，早晨不迎日出，晚上不送日落，是克里姆林宫的星辰照耀着它们。其实她到克里姆林宫也去过不止一次。她在那儿和领袖们见过面，他们赠给了她勋章和奖牌：因为她生的儿女多，因为她的劳动好，因为年青时代她在国内战争的疆场上立了战斗功勋。
    天刚放亮，女织工就起来，全家也就随着她起床了。每个人都随着母亲到自己的岗位上去了。有的在工厂作工，有的学习，有的驾着飞机在空中飞翔。母亲把自己当飞行员的儿子们称为雄健的山鹰，把自己的助手，女儿们，叫着初升的太阳。
    寡妇的幼子叫弗拉吉米尔。为了不落在哥哥的后面，为了不叫妈妈丢脸，为了能叫青年团以他而骄矜，所以弗拉吉米尔就努力地学习着。这个小伙子跟歌子交了好朋友。他唱着歌子起床，他唱着歌子就寝。莫斯科的街道和公园都知道弗拉吉米尔的悦耳的嗓声。他在自己的院里一唱——过路人就停在门前；他在树林里一唱，——树木就静寂不响，鸣鸟也就不再啼啭；它们都在倾听他的歌声。
    当他刚满十七岁，——就在那一天开了战。
    寡妇的六个儿子，六个飞行员，像群鹰似的立刻飞往前线。三个女儿，只待了一宿，太阳初升时，辞别了母亲，上了前线当看护员。
    母亲跟前只剩下一个幼子弗拉吉米尔。而在开战后的第十二天，弗拉吉米尔听见了领袖动人的和动心的话：“我的朋友们！我向你们说话……”斯大林的话抓住了弗拉吉米尔的心。他和母亲告别了，也没说到那儿去，晚上就没有回家。到了第四天，他的辞别信才寄来：“妈妈，我求你，不要哭，不要因我而难过。我是按照斯大林的话到前线去打恶棍的！”
    光阴如流水，一个星期跟着一个星期地集成了一个月，一个月又一个月地汇成了一年。战争在祖国的大地上散播了无限的痛苦。寡妇很少接到儿子们寄来的信，而且幼子根本就不写。母亲总是盼望着，期待着。等了一天又一天，等了一周又一周，等了一月又一月，可是总不见有信来。怎么办？只好多劳动，把心都放在工作上。寡妇不知道睡觉——休息，不知疲劳地织着布，用它来给儿女作衣裳。她在想：“难道说我只有十个孩子吗？所有的人凡是在那儿，在远近战线上不惜自己生命、粉碎敌人的人，——都是我们血肉相联的儿女！”
    可是战争，如流水：虽然是血，但总流走了。
    英勇的战士们开始转回家园，家庭里充溢了快乐。母亲等待着，什么时候在她的家里也能歌声嘹亮。
    四个儿子和三个女儿都回来了，有两个为祖国尽了忠。幼子却杳无音信。母亲伤心，难过，真是：“话少，眼泪多，伤心泪如河，伤心泪汇成无底的河”。
    光阴如流水，一个星期跟着一个星期地集成了一个月，一个月又一个月地汇成了一年。可是这一年像一分钟似地过去了，在一个深夜的时刻，当所有的窗户向克里姆林宫的星光遥望的家庭里走进来一个战士，母亲马上认出了幼子。她投身拥抱他，吻他，高兴地淌出眼泪来。她莫明其妙，勿论她说什么，他只是抚弄着她那苍白的头发。他一句话也不说，哥哥们乘兴抬起他来，把他扔上空中；他也拥抱大家，就是不说话。那时家里的人明白了，弗拉吉米尔是哑了。他再也不会唱了，从今以后任何人在任何时候也不会听见他的歌声了……
    这位女织工的家，活像没有夜莺的花园，家中有快乐也有悲伤：活着回来了，但是没有歌声了。
    为了庆祝胜利，伟大的斯大林下令在克里姆林宫的几间大厅里，摆上餐桌，邀请了自己的优秀的勇士。女织工家里，她的儿子们都参加那个丰盛的大宴会去了，因为他们都英勇地为了祖国战斗过。斯大林端起酒杯向每个人敬酒，并要求讲一讲他的战地工作，建立的功勋。战友同志们讲了很多辉煌的事业，说了很多祝贺的话。
    这回，这回轮到了弗拉吉米尔，这个青年战士的面前。他站了起来，默默地给斯大林深深鞠了一躬。而他，弗拉吉米尔应说的话，都被他的战斗同志们代说了。他们讲了，他是怎样的一个歌手，他怎样唱着歌上了前线，怎样出来侦察。他们讲了他怎样被法西斯鬼子捉住了，用严刑拷打他，可是没能打出一句话来。这个苏联战士用歌颂祖国的歌子回答了拷打。就是因为这首歌子，这首对敌人来说比子弹还可怕的歌子，给他割掉了舌头，他们把他弄哑。弗拉吉米尔从刽子手手里逃掉了。如今，他的歌声消逝了，但是歌子却活着，歌子要撕破他的胸膛，但是他却唱不出声。
    斯大林听完了这段可敬的故事，拥抱了弗拉吉米尔，把他称作英雄，因为他有功劳，并赠给他一个小提琴。
    战士仰望了斯大林一眼，接过提琴，放上了提琴弓子，小提琴突然响了起来了。它用美妙的声音唱起来了。大家都觉得这不是提琴，而是弗拉吉米尔在歌唱胜利，歌唱人生，歌唱幸福，歌唱伟大的斯大林。那些充满在弗拉吉米尔胸膛的歌曲，仿佛任意地迸发出来了。生存和欢乐的意志又回到弗拉吉米尔的身上。那天晚上，人们站在克里姆林宫前，虽然看不见，可是他们却听见了弗拉吉米尔那歌颂我们人民的功勋并呼唤向新的胜利挺进的声音。
    据说如今这个提琴已不只在莫斯科，不只在我们一个国家里，而且普天之下处处都在嘹亮地响起来了！它在叙述着伟大的领袖，叙述着我们强大的国家，号召全世界走向和平。
