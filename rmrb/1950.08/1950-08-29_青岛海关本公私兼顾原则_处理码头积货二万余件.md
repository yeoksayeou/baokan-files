　　Xinhua News Agency, dated 23rd: According to news from the General Administration of Customs, Qingdao Customs, based on the principle of considering both public and private interests, has completed the handling of over 20,000 pieces of accumulated goods at the Qingdao port wharf that failed to declare and pay taxes for various reasons.

　　These accumulated goods were imported from November of last year to March of this year. The majority were ordered and imported by Shanghai merchants, and were transshipped through Qingdao due to the blockade of Shanghai port by the Kuomintang remnant bandits. Some of the cargo owners did not apply for import licenses in advance, and some did not complete the re-registration procedures, and therefore could not declare customs early; others, although they had declared customs, were unable to pay taxes in time due to the stable decline in prices and the tightening of loans by public and private banks, resulting in insufficient capital turnover for importers. The extension fees for these accumulated goods' manifests, tax late payment penalties, and warehouse detention fees accumulated and increased daily, leading some cargo owners to either declare abandonment of the goods or avoid appearing.

　　In order to handle this batch of accumulated goods, Qingdao Customs successively convened relevant parties to discuss solutions. The Qingdao Port Authority has completely waived the warehouse detention fees before April 1. Finally, the General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government decided on four handling methods, reducing or waiving tax late payment penalties and manifest extension fees for this batch of accumulated goods. Qingdao Customs, based on these four methods, has completed the separate handling of all accumulated goods.

　　青岛海关本公私兼顾原则
    处理码头积货二万余件
    【新华社二十三日讯】据海关总署消息：青岛海关在公私兼顾的原则下，已将青岛港口因各种原因未能报关纳税的码头积货二万余件分别处理完毕。
    这些积货是去年十一月至今年三月进口的。其中大部分是上海商人订购进口，因上海港口被国民党残匪封锁，而改由青岛转口输入的。货主中有一部分并未事先请领输入许可证，也有一部分未办理换证手续，因而不能早日报关；另有一部分虽已报关，但因物价稳落，公私银行紧缩放款，进口商资金周转不灵，又未能及时完税。这些积货的舱单展期费、税款滞纳金及仓库留置费逐日积累增多，以致若干货主或声明放弃货物，或避不出面。
    青岛海关为了处理这批积货，曾先后召集有关各方座谈处理办法，青岛港务局已将四月一日以前的仓库留置费用予以全部豁免。最后并由中央人民政府海关总署决定四项处理办法，对这批积货的税款滞纳金、舱单展期费分别予以减免。青岛海关根据这四项办法，已将所有积货分别处理完毕。
