　　Shanghai's Changing Foreign Trade
　　By our special correspondent Lin Wei

　　Colonialization Before Liberation
　　Shanghai is the largest port for foreign trade in our country. In the past, the total value of import and export trade accounted for 60% to 70% of the country's total annually. A large amount of silk, tea, tung oil, menthol, medicinal materials, egg products, bristles, etc. produced in the provinces along the Yangtze River were mostly exported through this port. Hardware equipment, petroleum products, dyes, pigments, pulp, chemical raw materials, etc., which were needed for industrial production but lacking in our country, were mostly imported through this port. Before the Anti-Japanese War, almost all of Shanghai's import and export trade was operated by foreign merchants, and very few Chinese private merchants were involved. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionary government served American imperialism with colonial import tariff concessions (namely the so-called agreement tariff of August 1948) and low official exchange rates. According to the tariff concessions, most of the imported goods from the United States were subject to tax reductions, some even reduced by more than 50%. The types of goods allowed to be imported were also extremely large (many of which were unnecessary and should not have been imported). At that time, the exchange rate was often far behind the market price, sometimes lower than the market price by 80% or 90%, which further facilitated the massive import of American goods. This caused import firms to develop abnormally and unusually. Moreover, because importers could obtain low-priced allocated foreign exchange to carry out speculative transactions, it also promoted the increase in the number of import firms. On the export side, due to the possibility of making huge profits from the devaluation of Kuomintang currency and large-scale evasion of foreign exchange, there was also abnormal development. According to the registration statistics after liberation, there were 1,434 import firms and 1,446 export firms in Shanghai. This abnormal development shows that Shanghai before liberation was accelerating its colonialization, while national industry and commerce were accelerating their decline.

　　Limiting Imports and Rewarding Exports After Liberation
　　After liberation, the new China's foreign trade policy implemented a historic and fundamental change: from serving imperialism and bureaucratic capital to serving productive undertakings beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The traitorous import tariff concessions were abolished; more than half of the 672 kinds of imported materials in that tariff, which were non-essential and could be produced in large quantities domestically, have been prohibited from import. In order to ensure the implementation of this policy, a strict import license system was also implemented. This allowed all legitimate national industries and businesses in the country to receive state protection for the first time, and had the possibility of growth and development. On the export side, the state gave exporters reasonable preferential treatment and assistance in many aspects to promote their development, so as to find outlets for our country's large quantities of native and special products, and in turn exchange for the raw materials and machinery needed for domestic production. For example, in terms of transportation, priority was given to the loading and transportation of export materials. Tea, bristles, tung oil, raw silk, tea bricks and other major export materials were given preferential treatment of halving the freight when transshipped for export. In terms of capital turnover, as of early May this year, more than 7 million US dollars of export advance exchange and more than 4.2 million US dollars of packing loans were given to private merchants. The state also took the initiative to strive to control the foreign exchange rate, so as to stabilize it at about 6 Shanghai discounted units per US dollar. At the same time, export price review and export price limit measures were adopted to ensure legitimate operations, so as to prevent the sharp drop in foreign market prices caused by private merchants' indiscriminate price competition. The insurance department underwrites export war risk insurance, so as not to suffer accidental losses. With the support of this correct policy, from June last year to March this year, Shanghai's total exports (including direct exports and transshipment exports) reached 21.38 million US dollars. Compared with the total imports of 19.23 million US dollars, there was a trade surplus of 2.15 million US dollars. In the total value of imports and exports, private merchants accounted for about two-thirds.

　　Breaking Through Numerous Difficulties
　　This advantage in foreign trade was obtained in the face of serious difficulties. One of the biggest difficulties after liberation was the blockade of Shanghai's port by the US-Chiang clique. In order to overcome this difficulty, the foreign trade department vigorously organized transshipment imports and exports. Statistics from January to March this year show that this transshipment import and export was larger than direct import and export.

　　The second is the difficulty of lacking foreign exchange. In order to increase foreign exchange, a strict export foreign exchange settlement system was implemented. The foreign exchange rate was also appropriately increased to encourage exports and overseas remittances. From December last year to May this year, one US dollar was equivalent to 5.6 or even 7 Shanghai discounted units. In the past, due to the lower exchange rate, the foreign barter trade method was implemented to subsidize exporters and strive for necessary imports. However, because exporters could obtain huge profits in imports, they carelessly sold export goods at low prices, disrupting the foreign market. After the exchange rate was appropriately increased, both exports and overseas remittances gradually increased. For example, taking the number of overseas remittances in June last year as 100, it reached 511 in March this year and 624 in April. At the same time, private merchants were opened up and encouraged to import with their own foreign exchange to alleviate the difficulty of insufficient foreign exchange positions. For example, import duties on raw cotton were exempted, on the one hand to replenish the raw materials of the cotton textile industry, and on the other hand to encourage funds fleeing abroad to return to the country. From June to December last year, 40% of the total value of goods approved for import was self-provided foreign exchange. In this way, the foreign exchange controlled by the government gradually increased. Now it can supply some foreign exchange to factories that need to import materials.

　　Some Problems Need to Be Solved
　　After the liberation of Zhoushan, the situation of Shanghai's foreign trade has further improved. However, there are still many problems to be solved. On the export side, the import and export conference in late June specifically discussed the issue of promoting and controlling the foreign market of export materials. Our country's tung oil, bristles, menthol, etc. are all of very good quality. However, in the past, due to blind competition among exporters, coupled with the competition of foreign commodities or substitutes, foreign market prices often fluctuated violently, dropped sharply, and sometimes even lost money. Among them, except for bristles, minerals and soybeans, which have been unified by the state, and the price has been guaranteed to a certain extent (the foreign price of bristles has increased by more than 50% after the unified sales), other items are subject to export price review and price limit measures, which also have a certain effect. Recently, more than 20 straw hat enterprises have implemented joint operations, which is also a method worthy of attention. The joint organization is participated by state-owned companies and bears half of the funds. The purchase and sale prices are unified, and there is no longer competition among the industry. The number of purchases is more planned, and the specifications and quality can be unified and improved. And because the guarantee strength is strengthened, a lot of convenience is obtained in loans. After the establishment of the joint organization, it signed a contract with the Bank of China for a loan of 250,000 US dollars and a preferential remittance method, and the business has made progress. In terms of tung oil, joint sales have also been implemented recently. Appropriate measures have also been stipulated for other important export materials. If these steps can be implemented well and promoted, most exporters can obtain considerable profits and avoid being defeated by foreign merchants one by one. The quality of the goods is determined to strengthen the inspection, so as to avoid affecting the credibility due to adulteration and other behaviors. The acquisition of export materials was difficult in the past because the state's purchase price for agricultural products was high; this conference decided and began to implement public-private joint price negotiation for some export materials, which will be improved. In addition, the production of export materials needs to be more planned. For example, the total demand for menthol in various countries is only 20,000 boxes, and the estimated output of our country this year can reach 20,000 boxes. Brazil and Japan can produce 5,000 boxes per year in total, which is more than enough, and should not be promoted for planting anymore.

　　On the import side, the first problem is that due to the low purchasing power of the domestic people and the slow recovery and development of industrial production, the demand for foreign raw materials and machinery is very small, and it is not suitable for blind import. Second, the demand is not much, and imperialism has recently strengthened the export license system and implemented a blockade against us. Therefore, we must find ways to break through the blockade in order to import the necessary materials. Third, due to insufficient investigation and understanding of the inventory and demand of raw materials in various factories (now each trading company and public and private factories have plans, but they are not reliable enough), there are still many blind phenomena in imports, and planning needs to be strengthened. Fourth, import merchants used to be very speculative, mostly relying on low-priced allocated foreign exchange and importing many unnecessary goods to make huge profits; now under the new policy, difficulties will naturally arise. Therefore, joint operations and other methods should also be used to overcome the difficulties in capital and credit issues. The internal unreasonable organization and system (generated in the era of speculation) must also be vigorously reformed.

　　In addition, for these import and export merchants, especially import merchants, the state should provide assistance on the one hand (such as the necessary foreign exchange supply), and prevent their speculation on the other hand. They should be advised not to be nostalgic for the past tricks of hoarding, raising prices, and shorting, and taking advantage of any loopholes. Because doing so will only bring trouble to themselves. In today's stable prices of major consumer goods, state trading agencies should further control important industrial raw materials to prevent large fluctuations in their prices, so as to normalize and fix industrial costs and profits, and lay the foundation for recovery and development. This work still needs to be continued.

### 转变中的上海对外贸易

　　转变中的上海对外贸易
    本报特派记者  林韦
    解放前的殖民地化
    上海是我国对外贸易的最大港口，过去每年出进口贸易总额占全国百分之六十至七十。长江各省所产的大量丝、茶、桐油、薄荷脑、药材、蛋品、猪鬃等等，多经此出口。工业生产上需要而为我国所缺乏的五金器材、石油产品、染料、颜料、纸浆、化工原料等等，多经此入口。抗日战争以前，上海的出进口贸易几乎全由外商经营，中国私商经营的很少。抗战胜利以后，国民党反动政府，以殖民地性的进口减让税则（即一九四八年八月的所谓协定税则）及低牌价外汇为美帝国主义服务。按照减让税则，大部美国来的进口货物都实行减税，有的甚至减轻百分之五十以上。准许入口的货物种类也极多（其中有许多是不需要与不应该入口的）。那时候的外汇牌价，经常远落在市价之后，有时比市价低到百分之八、九十，更有利于美货大量进口。这样，进口商行就畸形地不正常地发展起来。而且由于进口商能得到低价配给外汇，进行投机买卖，也促进了进口行招牌的增加。出口方面，因为可以在国民党货币贬值与大量逃避外汇中谋取暴利，也有不正常的发展。据解放后的登记统计，上海的进口商行有一、四三四家，出口商行有一、四四六家。这种畸形的发展，说明了解放前的上海是在加速殖民地化，而民族工商业却在加速衰落。
    解放后的限入奖出
    解放后，新中国的对外贸易政策实行了历史性的根本的变革：从为帝国主义与官僚资本服务转向为有益国计民生的生产事业服务。卖国的进口减让税则废除了；该税则中六百七十二种进口物资，半数以上是非急需的、本国也能大量生产的，已禁止入口了。为使这一政策能贯彻实施，同时实行了严格的进口许可证制。这使国内一切正当的民族工商业，第一次得到国家的保护，有了生长发展的可能。出口方面，国家给出口商以多方面的合理的优惠待遇与帮助，促其发展，使之为我国大量的土产特产找寻出路，进而换取国内生产所需要的原料与机器。比如在运输上保证出口物资优先装运。茶叶、猪鬃、桐油、生丝、茶砖等主要出口物资转口输出时，并给以运费减半的优待。资金周转上，截至今年五月初旬，给私商以出口押汇七百多万美元，打包放款四百二十万以上美元。国家并主动努力掌握外汇牌价，使其稳定在美金一元合上海折实单位六个左右。同时以出口审价及出口限价办法保证正当经营，使不致因私商滥价竞售而引起国外市价的暴跌。保险部门承保出口兵险，使不致遭受意外损失。在此正确政策的扶助下，从去年六月至今年三月，上海输出总额（包括直接输出与转口输出）达二、一三八万美元。与输入总额一、九二三万美元相较，出超二一五万美元。在输出入总额中，私商经营的约占三分之二。
    打破了重重的困难
    这种对外贸易上的优势，是在严重困难中获得的。解放后最大的困难之一，是美蒋封锁上海港口。为克服这一困难，对外贸易部门曾大力组织转口输出入。今年一月至三月统计，这种转口输出入比直接输出入还大。
    其次是缺乏外汇的困难。为了增加外汇，严格实行了出口结汇制度。并将外汇牌价适当提高，鼓励输出与侨汇进口。从去年十二月至今年五月，一美元合到上海折实单位五、六个甚至七个。在以前，由于牌价较低，曾实行国外易货办法以补助出口商，并争取必需的进口。但出口商因为能在输入中获得厚利，即满不在乎地低价抛售出口货，把国外市场搞乱了。牌价适当提高以后，出口与侨汇都逐渐增加。如以去年六月侨汇进口数量为一百，今年三月达到五一一，四月达到六二四。与此同时，开放并奖励私商自备外汇进口，以减轻外汇头寸不足的困难。如实行原棉进口免税，一方面充实棉纺工业原料，一方面鼓励逃亡国外的资金回国。去年六月至十二月，批准入口货物总值的百分之四十是自备外汇。这样，政府掌握的外汇逐渐增多。现已可以对需要进口物资的工厂供给部分外汇了。
    有些问题需要解决
    舟山解放以后，上海的对外贸易形势进一步好转。但也还有不少问题有待继续解决。出口方面，六月下旬的出进口会议上特别讨论了推广与掌握出口物资之国外市场问题。我国的桐油、猪鬃、薄荷脑等，都是品质很好的。但过去因为出口商相互间盲目竞争，加上外国商品或代用品的竞争，国外市场价格时常发生猛烈波动，急剧降落，有时甚至要赔本。其中除猪鬃、矿砂与大豆已由国家统销，价格上获得一定保证（猪鬃统销后国外价格上升百分之五十以上），其他物品实行出口审价，限价办法，也有一定效果外，最近草帽业二十多家实行联营，也是值得重视的办法之一。该联营机构由国营公司参加，并担负一半资金。收货售货价格统一，同业间也不再进行竞争。收货的数量较有计划，规格与品质也能统一、提高。且因保证力量加强，贷款上获得不少方便。该联营机构成立后，即与中国银行订立了二十五万美金贷款及汇款优待办法的合约，业务就获得了进展。桐油方面，近亦实行联销。其他重要出口物资，也规定了适当的办法。这些步骤如能实行得好，并加以推广，即可使大多数出口商都获得相当利润，避免被外商各个击破。货的品质，决定加强检验，以免因掺假等行为而影响信誉。出口物资的收购，以前私商因国家对农产品收价较高而感到困难；这次会议决定并开始对部分出口物资实行公私共同议价，将能有所改善。此外，出口物资的生产，需要更有计划。比如薄荷脑，各国需要量总计不过二万箱，我国今年产量估计已可达二万箱。巴西和日本共可年产五千箱，已有多余，即不应再事推广种植。
    进口方面，第一个问题是由于国内人民购买力未提高，工业生产尚未迅速恢复与发展，对国外原料与机器的胃纳很小，不宜盲目进口。第二、需要既不多，而帝国主义近又加强出口许可证制度，对我实行封锁。因而要设法突破封锁，以输入需要的物资。第三、由于对各厂原料的储藏量、需要量调查了解不够（现各个贸易公司与公私工厂都有计划，但不够可靠），进口中的盲目现象还不少，还须加强计划性。第四、进口商过去投机性很大，多是依靠低价配给外汇与输入许多不必要的货品来牟暴利；现在在新的政策下，自然不能不发生困难。所以也应该以联营等方法来克服资金与信用问题上的困难。其内部不合理的机构与制度（投机时代所产生的），亦须大力实行改革。
    此外，对这些出进口商，尤其进口商，国家一方面要给以扶助（如必要的外汇供给），一方面要防止其投机性。劝导他们不要再留恋过去囤积、高抬、抛空等把戏，见空子就钻。因为这样是会自找苦吃的。在主要消费品物价已臻稳定的今天，国家贸易机关应该进一步掌握重要的工业原料，使其价格不发生大的波动，这样才能使工业成本与利润趋向正常化、固定化，奠定恢复发展的基础。这一工作还有待继续努力。
