　　Shanghai: During the collection of industrial and commercial taxes for March, April and May, the Shanghai Tax Bureau, in order to implement the resolution and spirit of the Second National Tax Conference on "calculating taxes according to rates and handling affairs according to law", has adopted democratic appraisal for tax collection. Most industrial and commercial households have been able to report and pay taxes truthfully and on time, but some industrial and commercial households are still selfish and try their best to evade taxes. According to the tax evasion data collected from 37 industries appraised by districts and industries in the city, the main methods of tax evasion are as follows: (1) two sets of books, (2) multiple invoices, (3) setting up secret accounts, (4) concealing account books, (5) treating sales as commissions, (6) recording small numbers but not large numbers, and (7) making false records. Among all tax evaders, the tax evasion of Jiujiang Road Zhongting Pharmacy is the most serious. The company was found to have underreported a turnover of 794 million yuan through false accounts, while the original reported turnover was only 1.21 million yuan, a difference of more than 650 times. The remaining general tax evasions are mostly around ten times. In order to complete the state's tax revenue tasks, how to completely correct the serious tax evasion behavior is still a problem that the Shanghai Tax Bureau and the industrial and commercial circles should pay close attention to.

　　沪市民主评议工商业税中
    部分商户漏税仍严重
    【本报上海讯】上海市税务局为贯彻二届全国税务会议“依率计征、依法办事”的决议和精神，在征收三、四、五月份工商业税时，已根据新精神采用民主评议进行稽征，大部分工商业户均能照实报税，并按时缴纳，但仍有部分工商业户自私自利，想尽种种方法企图逃税。据该市分区分业评议的三十七业所搜集的逃税资料，主要的逃税方法不外以下几种：（一）两套账，（二）多种发票，（三）设立暗户，（四）隐匿账册，（五）销货作佣金，（六）记小数不记大数，（七）记载不实等。所有逃税户中，以九江路中庭西药行漏税最严重。该号设置假账被查出漏报营业额七亿九千四百万元，而原报营业额仅一百二十一万元，相差竟达六百五十余倍。其余一般的逃税，大都在十倍左右。为了完成国家税收任务，如何彻底纠正严重的偷漏税行为，仍是目前上海市税务局与工商业界应该严加注意的问题。
