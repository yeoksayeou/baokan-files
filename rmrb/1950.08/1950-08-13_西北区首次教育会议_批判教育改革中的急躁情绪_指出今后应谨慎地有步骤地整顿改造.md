　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th: The first Northwest Regional Education Conference emphatically criticized the impatient mood in the reform work of the Northwest Region's education cause. This conference was held in Xi'an from July 24th to August 3rd. A total of 77 representatives of all ethnic groups from various provinces and cities attended, with 72 observers. The conference summarized the work and experience of secondary education and social education in the past year and put forward the future education principles and tasks. According to the conference's statistics, there are now 309 secondary schools in the entire Northwest, with more than 5,600 faculty and staff members and more than 79,400 students. Over the past year, through in-class and extracurricular learning and various social activities, teachers and students have, to varying degrees, broken away from the influence of reactionary ideas and understood the direction of future efforts. In terms of social education, more than 340,000 people participated in winter schools, spare-time literacy schools, and short-term worker training classes last year. They have generally learned two to three hundred characters and studied some current policies. Therefore, the conference pointed out that the past work has been successful. However, there were also some serious deviations in the work process. The conference seriously criticized the practice of some middle schools attempting to replace long-term conscious ideological remolding with methods such as "three criticisms and struggles," the blindness and dogmatism in teaching work, and the impatient mood in the work in ethnic minority areas. The conference pointed out that although the above deviations have been promptly corrected after being discovered by the leading organs, vigilance should still be maintained in future work. Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, pointed out at the meeting: "Reform of the old education is necessary, but it must be carried out step by step on the basis of mass consciousness. Impatience and subjectivism will lead to mistakes." He especially reminded teachers and students in fraternal ethnic regions that they must not measure the consciousness of the broad masses by their own consciousness. Doing so will lead to detachment from the masses and accomplish nothing. The conference finally put forward the future tasks: secondary education should focus on continuing to cautiously and step by step rectify and transform, strengthen political and ideological education, and further improve teaching content and methods; social education will consolidate existing achievements and make appropriate developments.

　　西北区首次教育会议
    批判教育改革中的急躁情绪
    指出今后应谨慎地有步骤地整顿改造
    【新华社西安十日电】西北区第一次教育会议着重地批判了西北区教育事业的改革工作中的急躁情绪。这个会议系于七月二十四至八月三日在西安举行。出席各省、市各民族代表共七十七人，列席共七十二人。会议总结了过去一年来中等教育、社会教育的工作和经验，提出了今后的教育方针和任务。根据会议的统计。现在全西北共有中等学校三百零九所，教职员五千六百余人，学生七万九千四百余人。一年来通过课内外的学习及各种社会活动，师生们均在不同的程度上脱离了反动思想的影响，懂得了今后努力的方向。社会教育方面，去年共有三十四万余人分别参加了冬学业余补习学校和短期职工训练班等，他们已普遍认识了二、三百个字，并学习了当前若干政策。因此，会议指出过去的工作是有成绩的。但在工作过程中，也存在着某些严重的偏向。会议严肃地批判了某些中学企图以“三评斗争”等方式来代替长期的自觉的思想改造的作法，教学工作上的盲目性与教条主义，以及在少数民族地区工作中的急躁情绪。会议指出：虽然上述偏向经领导机关发现后已及时纠正，但仍应在今后工作中加以警惕。西北军政委员会习仲勋副主席在会上指出：“对旧教育的改革是有必要的，但必须在群众自觉的基础上逐步进行，急躁、主观是会犯错误的。”他特别提醒在兄弟民族地区的教员、学生，决不能以自己的觉悟去衡量广大群众的觉悟。这样做将会脱离群众而一事无成。会议最后提出今后的任务：中等教育以继续谨慎地、有步骤地整顿与改造为主，加强政治思想教育，并进一步改进教学内容与方法；社会教育除巩固现有成绩外并将作适当发展。
