　　The Main Task of Military Newspapers
　　Lieutenant General Satilov

　　Our military newspapers have grown and developed together with all Soviet newspapers and are gloriously fulfilling the tasks they face. Their role in the political, military, and cultural education of Soviet soldiers is very significant. Soldiers and officers are accustomed to reading newspapers, magazines, and books, and treat them as a necessity of life. Our soldiers find materials in books and newspapers that help them broaden their political and cultural horizons, improve their combat skills, and correctly understand current events. The labor achievements of our people, the military studies of Soviet soldiers, and the inspiring examples of loyal service to the motherland are correctly and clearly explained in the pages of military newspapers and magazines.

　　Soviet military newspapers have achieved considerable success in promoting Marxism-Leninism, Stalin's military science, Soviet patriotism, the friendship of all nationalities, and the advantages of the socialist system over the decaying capitalist system.

　　Recently, military newspapers have better and more fully clarified the life of troops and regiments, their combat and political studies. Many newspapers have successfully introduced the practice of Party's political work in the troops and the excellent experience of combat and political studies. They have become real helpers in the activities of commanders, political organs, and Party organizations.

　　However, there are still many shortcomings in our newspaper work. These shortcomings are due to the fact that the responsible persons of the command, political organs, and Party organizations do not know how to use newspapers in the entire educational work system. Often, when the command puts forward important plans for the combat and political education of the troops, the newspapers do not participate in this matter in a timely manner, but stay aside.

　　The shortcomings in the work of military newspapers are largely due to the fact that some newspaper staff know very little about the life of the troops, and the current problems of combat study in the troops and regiments raised in the newspapers do not show the due initiative and enthusiasm. These staff do not quickly react to this or that event, seize advanced and emerging things, and help them to be affirmed in life; on the contrary, they avoid lively problems and lag behind events.

　　Many staff members of military newspapers lack the spirit of struggling to promote criticism and self-criticism, and they cannot carry out what has been started to the end. For example: Not long ago, at the election report Party Congress and Party representative meetings, Party members exposed many shortcomings in Party life, and they made concrete resolutions to overcome these shortcomings. The newspapers published a lot of important materials on this aspect. However, two or three months have passed, and several newspapers are no longer interested in this matter, as if the suggestions made by the Party members have already been implemented.

　　Until now, some military newspapers have not done enough in summarizing the experience of Party's political work, and they have not disseminated the best experience of political organs and Party organizations.

　　These and many other shortcomings are completely surmountable. It only requires desire, initiative, and Bolshevik tenacity in work.

　　The most important task of military newspapers is to do their best to help the command in the struggle for a high level of combat and political training and to consolidate discipline and organization in the troops. The newspapers can and should do a lot to cultivate outstanding soldiers. It is necessary to widely attract advanced soldiers to write for the newspapers, tirelessly promote their experience, and make this experience the property of all soldiers.

　　The "Soviet Soldier" newspaper (edited by Comrade Galpovsky) has shown commendable initiative in this regard. The newspaper regularly publishes articles introducing excellent experience and enthusiastically publishes articles by outstanding soldiers. The newspaper helps the command to prepare and hold fellowship meetings of outstanding soldiers. A column "Welcome the Fellowship Meeting of Outstanding Soldiers" was opened in the newspaper a long time ago, publishing many informative articles by soldiers and non-commissioned officers who have won the medal of outstanding soldiers.

　　Promoting combat regulations, persistently implementing these regulations into the daily life of the troops, deeply explaining the requirements of the military oath, promoting combat traditions, and cultivating the combat coordination spirit of soldiers and non-commissioned officers - all of these are inseparable from the struggle for the development of combat and political training of outstanding soldiers.

　　It is necessary to tirelessly promote the great organizational and inspiring role of the Bolshevik Party in the lives of the Soviet working people, the vibrant Soviet patriotism, the friendship of all nationalities, and the national and military pride of the Soviet Union with greater persistence and thoroughness. In this matter, the "For the Glory of the Motherland" newspaper (edited by Comrade Smirnov) correctly understands its task. The newspaper regularly publishes propaganda articles about our socialist country, explaining the correspondence between soldiers and factories and collective farms, publishing stories of soldiers on vacation, and other vivid materials about the motherland, about the Bolshevik Party, and about the Soviet people. It is such a noble and honorable task for Bolshevik newspaper staff to praise our great Soviet motherland and explain all the advantages of our motherland over the decaying capitalist system!

　　But this must be done vividly and convincingly. It is necessary to delve into life, collect the most interesting and educational facts, examples, and contrasts that prove the huge growth of our socialist industry and the most powerful socialist agriculture, prove the continuous improvement of the happy life of the Soviet people, and prove the rapid development of science and culture. It is necessary to use all strength to convincingly and clearly expose the scourge and sins of the decaying capitalist system.

　　Now, under peaceful conditions, our soldiers and officers have every possibility to systematically and deeply study the classic works of Marxism-Leninism. While tirelessly improving their ideological and theoretical level of propaganda work, military newspapers should give great help to Soviet soldiers, help them master Marxist-Leninist theory, and cultivate Soviet soldiers with the spirit of infinite loyalty to the motherland and the Party of Lenin and Stalin, and with the sincere spirit of the great ideals of communism.

　　It is necessary to elucidate the mass mobilization work that is being carried out in the troops more deeply and thoroughly than is currently being done, popularize the worthy experience of advanced mobilization groups, and tirelessly fight for the high quality and effectiveness of mass political mobilization. The newspaper's obligation is to help consolidate the achievements of mass mobilization work achieved during the election campaign and fight for its further improvement.

　　In the pages of our newspapers, it is necessary to systematically introduce how Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members are fighting for a pioneering role in combat and political studies. For this reason, it is necessary to have a good understanding of the organizational life of the Party and the League, be good at paying attention to the new things in their work in a timely manner, and widely elucidate their positive aspects and shortcomings.

　　The staff of military newspapers should be familiar with and widely explain the life of the company, because the company is the center of the Party's political work, soldiers, combat training, and education. At the same time, it is also necessary to strengthen attention to other regiments of the troops. The firm shift of military newspapers to the company and to the Party and League organizations of the company will greatly promote the improvement of the quality of combat and political training and the decisive improvement of educational work.

　　The serious shortcomings in some newspaper activities are due to their poor connection with the masses of soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and officers. In the editorial offices of some newspapers, readers' letters and communications are treated with an intolerable and indifferent attitude. The editorial offices of individual newspapers treat the materials of troop correspondents in a very bad manner. Their answers to the letters are stale, formulaic, and lack the true concern for people inherent in our Bolshevik newspapers.

　　Improving reader work and establishing a wide network of troop correspondents is one of the most important tasks of the troop newspaper. Enthusiastically caring for readers' letters, communicating regularly with troop correspondents, holding reader representative meetings, and editors maintaining frequent personal contact with troop correspondents and readers will help the newspaper continuously expand the network of troop correspondents, improve the quality of the newspaper, expand the scope of issues that the newspaper elucidates, and make the newspaper more effective and more active.

　　Special attention should be paid to the letters of service personnel. Comrade Stalin taught us to pay attention to reading every letter from everyone, and to respond to the indications and suggestions in the letters with a pragmatic spirit.

　　The role of military newspapers in the cultural education of soldiers has greatly increased. However, not all newspapers are engaged in this work satisfactorily. Promoting natural science knowledge, art and literature, helping soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers organize recreational activities, carrying out sports, art self-study, etc. - all of these should be an important part of the work of every military newspaper.

　　Commanders and political organs should play a huge role in the newspaper solving the tasks it faces. Their direct responsibility is to guide the activities of the newspaper on a daily basis, to put forward urgent issues in life and troop activities to the newspaper staff, and to help the editorial department explain the current issues of combat and political studies. Commanders, political organs, and Party organizations should teach and train military journalist cadres and improve their ideological and political level, political training, and professional ability.

　　Comrade Stalin, the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet government, and the Minister of the Army have put forward very important tasks to the Soviet soldiers: tirelessly improving the combat readiness of the troops, striving to strengthen the one-man leadership, discipline and order in the performance of duties, and constantly improving combat skills and political knowledge, guarding the peaceful labor of the Soviet people and the interests of the Soviet state.

　　In solving these tasks, the Soviet military newspapers should play a major role. There is no doubt that it will work with greater tenacity and initiative for the political, military, and cultural education of Soviet soldiers.

　　军队报刊的主要任务
    陆军中将  萨蒂洛夫
    我们的军队报刊是与所有苏维埃报刊一起成长、发展，并光荣地完成着它所面对的任务的。他在苏维埃战士的政治、军事和文化的教育中所起的作用，是非常伟大的。士兵和军官习于阅读报纸、杂志、书籍，并且把它们当作一种生活的必需品，我们的战士们在书籍和报纸的篇幅上找到帮助他们开展政治和文化的视野、帮助他们改善战斗技术和正确地理解当前事件的资料。我国人民的劳动成就，苏维埃战士的军事研究，忠诚服务祖国的令人鼓舞的范例，在军队报纸和杂志的篇幅上，得到正确而明了的阐述。
    苏维埃军队报刊在宣传马列主义、斯大林军事科学中，在宣传苏维埃爱国主义和各族人民的友谊、宣传社会主义制度对腐朽的资本主义制度的优点中，获得了不少的成就。
    最近，军队报刊更好地、更充实地阐明着部队和联队的生活，他们的战斗和政治学习。许多报纸成功地介绍着部队中党的政治工作的实践和战斗与政治学习的优良经验。它们成了指挥官、政治机关和党组织活动中的真正助手。
    但是在我们的报纸工作中仍然有很多缺点，这些缺点是由于指挥官、政治机关和党组织的负责人在整个教育工作制度中，不善于利用报纸而来。经常，当指挥部提出部队战斗和政治教育的重要计划时，报纸却没有及时地参与这件事情，而停留在一旁。
    军队报刊工作中的缺点，很大程度是由于某些报纸工作人员很少知道部队生活，在报纸上提出的各部队和联队战斗学习的当前问题，没有表现出应有的主动积极性。这些工作人员不是迅速地反应这一或另一事变，抓住先进的、新生的事物，帮助它在生活中肯定起来；却相反地，他们规避着生动活泼的问题，并落后于事变。
    军队报纸的许多工作人员缺乏为推动批评和自我批评而斗争的精神，他们不能把开始了的事情推行到底。例如：不久前在选举报告的党大会和党代表会议上，党员们揭露了党生活中的许多缺点，他们并作出了克服这些缺点的具体决议。报纸关于这方面曾揭载了不少重要的材料。但是两三个月过去了，若干报纸对这件事不感兴趣了，似乎党员们所提出的建议已经实现了似的。
    直到现在，某些军队报纸在总结党的政治工作经验方面，还做得非常不够，它们没有传播最好的政治机关和党组织的经验。
    这些以及其他许多缺点，都是完全可以克服的。只是需要愿望，主动积极性和工作中的布尔什维克的顽强性。
    军队报纸最重要的任务——是在为战斗的和政治的教练的高度水平、为巩固部队中的纪律性和组织性而作的斗争中，尽力帮助指挥部。报纸对于培养优等兵是能够而且应该作很多事情的。必须广泛地吸引先进的战士来为报纸写稿，不倦地宣传他们的经验，使这些经验成为所有战士的财产。
    《苏维埃战士》报（主编是加尔波夫斯基同志）在这方面表现了应当表扬的主动积极性。该报有规律地发表着介绍优良经验的论文，并且热心地发表优等兵的文章。该报帮助指挥部准备和举行优等兵联谊会。很早以前就在报上辟了“迎接优等兵联谊会”栏，发表许多荣获优等兵奖章的战士和士官的内容丰富的文章。
    宣传战斗条例，顽强地将这些条例贯彻到部队的日常生活中去，深刻解释军人誓约的要求，宣传战斗传统，培养战士和士官的战斗协同精神——所有这些，是与为发展战斗和政治教练的优等兵的斗争，不可分离的。
    必须以更大的坚持性与贯彻始终的精神，不倦地宣传苏联劳动人民生活中布尔什维克党的伟大组织和鼓舞的作用，宣传生气勃勃的苏维埃爱国主义，各族人民的友谊，苏维埃民族的和军队的自豪。在这件事情上，《为了祖国的光荣》报（主编是斯米尔诺夫同志）正确地懂得自己的任务。该报有规律地刊登着有关我们社会主义国家的宣传文章，阐明着战士与工厂及集体农场的来往信件，公布休假兵的故事及其他关于祖国、关于布尔什维克党、关于苏维埃人民的生动材料。布尔什维克报刊工作人员赞美我们伟大的苏维埃祖国，说明我们祖国对腐朽的资本主义制度的一切优点——这是何等高尚和尊贵的任务！
    但是必须生动地和使人信服地来作这件事。必须深入生活，搜集证明我们社会主义工业及最强大的社会主义农业的巨大增长，证明苏维埃人幸福生活的不断改善，证明科学与文化的迅速发展的最引人兴趣的和有教育意义的事实，范例，对照。必须用一切力量，使人信服地、明了地暴露腐朽的资本主义制度的祸害与罪恶。
    现在，在和平条件下，我们的士兵和军官有一切可能来系统地和深刻地研读马列主义的古典作品。在不倦地提高自己宣传工作的思想理论水平时，军队报纸应该给苏维埃战士以大力帮助，帮助他们掌握马列主义理论，以对祖国和列宁、斯大林党无限忠诚的精神，以对共产主义伟大思想的真诚精神来培养苏维埃的战士。
    必须比现在所做的更深刻、更彻底地阐明部队中进行着的群众鼓动工作，普及先进的鼓动小组的值得学习的经验，不倦地为群众政治鼓动的高质量和效果而斗争。报纸的义务——就是帮助巩固在选举运动时期所达到的群众鼓动工作的成就，并为其进一步的提高而斗争。
    在我们报纸的篇幅上，必须系统地介绍共产党员和共青团员怎样为战斗和政治学习中的先锋作用而斗争。为此，必须很好地知道党的和团的组织生活，善于及时地注意他们工作中的新鲜事物，广泛地阐明其积极方面和缺点。
    军队报纸的工作人员应该熟习和广泛地解释中队的生活，因为中队是党的政治工作、战士、战斗训练和教育的中心。同时还必须加强注意部队的其他联队。军队报纸的坚决转向中队、转向中队的党的和团的组织，将对战斗和政治教练质量的提高，对教育工作的决定性的改善，起重大的促进作用。
    某些报纸活动中的严重缺点，是由于它们与士兵、士官和军官群众的联系太差的结果。在一些报纸的编辑部中，是以一种不可容忍的，冷淡的态度对待读者来信和通讯的。个别报纸的编辑部以很恶劣的态度对待部队通讯员的材料，它们对来信的回答是陈腐的老套，是官样文章，缺乏我们布尔什维克报刊所固有的那种对人的真正关心。
    改善读者工作，建立广泛的部队通讯员网——这是部队报纸最重要的任务之一。热情地关心地对待读者来信，有规律地与部队通讯员通信，举行读者代表会议，编辑部工作人员与部队通讯员和读者经常保持个人的联系等，会帮助报纸不断地扩大部队通讯员网，提高报纸质量，扩大报纸所阐明的问题的范围，并使报纸成为更有效果的，更能发挥积极作用的。
    应该对服役人员的来信给予特别的注意。斯大林同志教导我们注意阅读每一个人的每封来信，并用实事求是的精神给来信的预示和建议以反应。
    军队报刊在战士文化教育中的作用，是大大增长了。然而不是所有的报纸都令人满意地从事这个工作。宣传自然科学知识、艺术文学，帮助士兵、士官及军官组织文娱活动，开展运动，艺术自修等等——所有这些，都应是每一军队报纸工作中的重要部分。
    在报纸解决其所面临的任务中，指挥官和政治机关应起巨大作用。他们的直接责任——就是日常指导报纸的活动，向报纸工作人员们提出生活和部队活动中的迫切问题，帮助编辑部解释战斗和政治学习的当前课题。指挥官、政治机关和党的组织应当教导和培养军事记者干部，提高他们的思想政治水平、政治锻炼和业务能力。
    斯大林同志、布尔什维克党、苏维埃政府、陆军部长向苏维埃战士提出了非常重要的任务：不倦的提高部队的战斗准备，竭力加强执行职务的一长制、纪律和秩序，不断提高战斗技术和政治知识，警卫苏维埃人们的和平劳动及苏维埃国家的利益。
    在解决这些任务中，苏维埃军队报刊应起重大作用。毋容置疑，它将以更大的顽强性和主动积极性来为苏维埃战士的政治、军事和文化教育而努力。
