　　Abusing Authority to Infringe on Private Shipping Industry
    Wu Jia Ying Dismissed from Post and Investigated
    [This newspaper dispatch] Wu Jia Ying, the chief of the Navigation Section of the Tianjin Shipping Bureau, was a retained personnel member after liberation. His thinking was backward, and he seriously exhibited the bad work style of the Kuomintang era. When the Tianjin Military Control Commission and the Central Ministry of Transportation approved the return of the "Dagong" steamship to the Shanghai private Dagong Shipping Company, Wu Jia Ying deceived his superiors and subordinates, practiced favoritism, abused his authority, and infringed on private business. The facts are as follows: The Dagong steamship (totaling 170 tons) was originally seized and detained by the Kuomintang bandit army. After the liberation of Northeast China in 1949, it was sailed to Tanggu and managed by the Maritime Public Security Bureau. The original shipowner, Zhao Wenqin, requested its return. After the Tianjin Shipping Bureau requested instructions from the Tianjin Military Control Commission and the Central Ministry of Transportation, its return to the original owner was approved in 1950. During Zhao Wenqin's processing of the ship retrieval procedures, Wu Jia Ying helped Zhao find a guarantor from Dahua Enterprise and handled other procedures, thus gaining Zhao's trust. Zhao then entrusted Wu with matters, and Wu took care of everything. Before Zhao went to Shanghai in February, he entrusted Wu to find a captain and take care of ship repairs, and instructed his deputy, An Maoliang, to consult with Wu on matters. Wu then took the opportunity to seize power, insert relatives and friends, introduced Che Kaiwen to manage the accounts, Tian Chuncheng (Che's brother-in-law) to manage the food, and Liu Fengming as the chief mate. The office location was also set up at Che's home. Initially, Wu discussed matters with An before handling them, but later he acted first and then discussed, and finally, he made decisions himself without consulting An. Zhao Wenqin originally planned to hire 16 crew members, but when Zhao returned to Tianjin on May 25, 23 crew members had already been hired. The deck crew could have been found a week before sailing, but Wu found them a month and a half in advance and told them to board the ship. Deck utensils and repair parts were also purchased by Wu. Wu also drafted and issued the crew's salaries himself. When financial difficulties arose, Wu borrowed more than 12 million yuan from cadres of the Shipping Bureau. The funds remitted by Zhao from Shanghai and the current outstanding funds totaled 130 million yuan, all handled by Wu, with a difference of one million yuan in the accounts. After Zhao returned to Tianjin, he repeatedly indicated that he wanted Wu to hand over the accounts and wanted Che and Tian to work at Zhao's office, but Wu refused to hand over the accounts, and Che and Tian did not go to Zhao's office. Chief Mate Liu still consulted Wu on matters, which greatly dissatisfied Zhao. Zhao entrusted Zhong Fujing, director of the Tanggu office of the Shipping Bureau, to inform Wu to hand over the accounts, but Wu stated that he had guaranteed Dahua Enterprise and had a heavy responsibility, so he must act as the manager himself and have Che Kaiwen as the deputy manager before he could hand over the accounts. It was not until June 24, when Zhong Fujing, director of the Tanggu office of the Shipping Bureau, reported to the bureau, that Wu handed over the accounts. After the Tianjin Shipping Bureau discovered this matter, it announced on June 27 that Wu Jia Ying would be suspended from his post and ordered to reflect on his actions, and investigated the matter with relevant parties. The results proved to be true, but Wu's reflection was extremely insincere. The Tianjin Shipping Bureau then, on July 5, with the approval of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, dismissed Wu Jia Ying from his post and transferred him to the Tianjin Municipal People's Court for handling according to law.

　　利用职权侵犯私人航业
    吴家瑛撤职查办
    【本报讯】天津航务局航务科长吴家瑛，系解放后的留用人员，思想落后，严重存在着国民党时代的恶劣作风。天津市军管会及中央交通部批准发还上海私营大公轮船公司之大公轮时，吴家瑛瞒上欺下，假公济私，滥用职权，侵犯私人营业。事实经过如下：大公轮（总计一七○吨）原被国民党匪军劫扣，于一九四九年东北解放后开至塘沽，由水上公安局代管。原船主赵文钦请求发还。经天津航务局请示天津市军管会及中央交通部，于一九五○年批准发还原主。在赵文钦办理领船手续的过程中，吴家瑛曾代赵找大华企业行出具担保，并代办其他手续，因而取得赵的信赖。赵即遇事托吴，而吴便事事包揽。赵于二月去上海前，托吴代找船长，照顾修船事宜，并嘱其副理安茅良遇事与吴商量。吴即乘机揽权，安插亲友，介绍车开文管账，田春城（车之内弟）管伙食，刘凤鸣当大副，办公地点亦设在车家。起初吴遇事尚与安先谈后办，后来则先做后谈，最后便自己作主，不再找安。赵文钦原拟雇船员十六人，当赵于五月二十五日回津时，已雇用船员二十三人之多。本来舱面船员可在开船前一星期找妥，而吴却在一个半月前即找妥，并叫他们上船。舱面用具和修船零件亦由吴代为购全。船员薪金吴亦自行拟数借发。开支发生困难时，吴即向航务局干部借款一千二百多万元。赵自上海汇来的款项与现在所欠款项，共达一亿三千万元之巨，均由吴经手账面并有一百万元的差额。自赵回津后，再三示意要吴交账，要车、田去赵处办公，但吴拒绝交账，车、田亦不去赵处办公。刘大副有事仍请示吴，使赵大为不满。赵委托航务局塘沽办事处主任钟福镜转知吴交账，而吴竟表示曾向大华企业行作保，责任重大，所以必须自当经理，并以车开文为副经理，始能交账。直到六月二十四日航务局塘沽办事处主任钟福镜向该局报告后，吴始将账交出。天津航务局发觉此事后，即于六月二十七日宣布将吴家瑛停职，令其反省，并向有关方面调查。结果证明属实，但吴反省极不坦白，天津航务局遂于七月五日经天津市人民政府批准将吴家瑛撤职，并移送天津市人民法院依法处理。
