Shandong Pingyin People's Bank Compulsory Loan Recovery: Serious Coercive Orders Issued; CCP County Committee Discovered and Corrected Immediately

[This newspaper reports] According to the *Dazhong Daily*: During the summer loan recovery work, the Pingyin County Office of the Shandong People's Bank committed serious acts of coercion and detention of the masses. In late June, the bank convened a county-wide meeting of bank cadres to arrange the loan recovery work. Due to the leadership's failure to adequately explain the policies or clearly assign tasks, only general arrangements were made. This led to serious coercive orders and a task-oriented perspective among the cadres in their loan recovery work after returning to their districts. When collecting loan grain in the villages, they similarly failed to explain the policies, reasoning, and methods to the village cadres, emphasizing only the task and demanding that the village cadres guarantee the completion of the loan recovery task, completely disregarding objective circumstances. Even if the task was not completed, the village cadres were held responsible. This led to a top-down approach of issuing coercive orders. For example, in the key village of Kongji Village (a severely disaster-stricken village), the chairman of the farmers' association used a loudspeaker to threaten the masses, saying, "If you don't hand it over in three days, I'll report you to the government!" The masses were forced to sell land and furniture to repay the loan grain. There were even individual disaster-stricken villagers who attempted suicide because they could not afford to repay (fortunately, they were discovered and did not die). More than thirty people were detained because they could not repay the loan grain. This serious violation of policy and atrocious work style severely alienated the masses. After discovering the above errors, the county committee immediately raised the issue with the bank and gave it strict criticism. The bank leadership also recognized the seriousness of the problem and immediately convened a meeting of all cadres. During the meeting, policy learning was carried out, and the serious harm of this error to the Party and the people was analyzed in conjunction with inspections. Finally, bank cadres were mobilized to return to the villages to apologize to the masses, especially the loan recipients, in order to restore the Party and government's influence. The final handling of this matter is currently being studied by the county committee.

　　山东平阴人民银行收贷中
    发生严重强迫命令
    中共县委发觉后已即时纠正
    【本报讯】据大众日报讯：山东人民银行平阴县办事处，夏季收贷工作中，发生严重强迫命令及扣押群众的现象。该行六月下旬，曾召开全县银行干部会议布置收贷工作，由于领导上没有很好的说明政策，没有清楚的交代任务，只作了一般布置，致使干部回区后，在收贷工作中产生了严重的强迫命令和任务观点。到村收贷粮时，同样不向村干部说明政策、道理及办法，强调任务，并要村干部保证完成收贷任务，完全不顾客观情况，完不成任务也要村干部负责。因此，从上而下的产生了强迫命令作法。如重点村孔集村（重灾村），农会主任用广播筒恐吓群众说：“限三天交不上，即到政府里说说去。”群众被逼得无法，有的卖地，卖家具等来还贷粮，甚至有个别灾区群众因还不起而自缢（幸经发觉未死）者。尚有因还不起贷粮而被扣押者共三十余人，这种严重违犯政策与恶劣的作风，严重的脱离了群众。县委发觉以上错误后，立即向银行提出，并予以严格的批评。银行领导上也认识到问题的严重性，即行召开全体干部会议。会议中进行了政策学习，并结合检查分析这一错误对党对人民的严重危害，最后并动员银行干部回村，向群众特别是贷粮户道歉，以挽回党与政府的影响。对此事的最后处理办法，该县县委正在研究中。
