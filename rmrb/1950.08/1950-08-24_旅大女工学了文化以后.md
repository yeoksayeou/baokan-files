　　After Studying Culture, Female Workers in Lüda...
    Shi Meimei
    Since the literacy campaign was launched in the Lüda area in the spring of 1949, thanks to the importance attached to it by the leadership, on the one hand, extensive and in-depth publicity and mobilization were carried out to inspire female workers' enthusiasm and demand for learning; on the other hand, special difficulties of female workers were taken into consideration as much as possible, so that female workers were also involved in this upsurge of cultural learning. After more than a year, significant results have been achieved. According to incomplete statistics from the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions in June this year: among 9,115 illiterate female workers, 8,648 participated in cultural learning, accounting for 94.8 percent. Generally, 3,400 people knew 300 to 600 characters, accounting for 39 percent of the total number of learners; 5,157 people knew 600 to 1,200 characters, accounting for 60 percent of the number of learners; 91 people knew more than 1,200 characters, and some individual female workers knew more than 3,000 characters. In the literacy model creation movement in November last year, 463 model workers in literacy were awarded, of which 141 were female workers, accounting for 30 percent (the number of female workers only accounted for 15 percent of the total number of workers).
    For thousands of years, female workers, like all women, were talking beasts of burden under feudal rule, and were deprived of the opportunity to learn. Today, they have stood up politically and become masters of the country and society, and have also begun to seek liberation in culture. Taking Lüda as an example, after they initially acquired the weapon of culture, their performance in all aspects is completely different.
    First, because they can read and have culture, female workers' ability to accept new things and their political level have been improved. As they themselves said: "In the past, when listening to political lectures, we knew it was the right principle, but we couldn't hear it clearly or remember it. Now that we can read, it's as if our brains have been opened up. Not only are we not confused when listening to reports, but we can also take notes, discuss and study in detail when we return, and understand many revolutionary principles." And they can often read books and newspapers, and pay more attention to national affairs and the political situation. They deeply realize that "without the leadership of the Party and leaders to lead the struggle, they would not be able to achieve such a political, economic, and cultural liberation like today!"
    Second, after female workers become literate, they can understand the achievements in the production competition in detail, which improves their production enthusiasm. Sun Guiqiu, a female warping worker at the Jin Textile Factory, used to be illiterate. She didn't dare to stand in front of the bulletin board for fear of being laughed at for not understanding it. Now that she recognizes more characters, she rushes to stand in front of the bulletin every day when she goes to and from work to carefully see everyone's production achievements, and calculates in her mind how to exceed the highest record. She also received a 15 percent bonus in June for improving product quality. Liu Guiying, a female yarn-winding worker at the Third Weaving Factory, has been in the factory for more than three years and doesn't know exactly how much her daily output is. After becoming literate, she can understand the production performance table and knows that her output is worse than others, so she works harder. In the past, she produced 90 kilograms of yarn in ten hours of work every day, but now she produces 110 kilograms of yarn in seven and a half hours of work every day. Wang Guihua, a female worker at the rubber factory, didn't quite understand the communication from the trade union cadres when the new record movement was launched. Later, when she saw in the newspaper that other factories had already created new records, she realized that as long as she increased her output beyond the highest standard, it would be a new record. She worked hard to increase her output from 70 pairs to 120 pairs per day.
    Third, because they are literate and have culture, the difficulties for female workers in learning technical theories have been reduced, and their confidence in learning has been enhanced. Liu Meilan, a literacy model of special grade in Lüda, who works at the metrology factory, was originally illiterate. After participating in learning, she learned more than 3,000 characters. She learned technology very quickly. In three months, she learned to draw drawings, make automatic scale pans, and repair all the technologies of steam meters. She put forward two rationalization proposals and brought a disciple. Wang Ruilan, an illiterate female worker at the Metal Machinery Factory, learned more than 3,000 characters and learned arithmetic in one and a half years through hard work. She can record what the teacher says about technical theory and review it at home. When she took the practical and technical theory test this year, she was the best among the eleven apprentices. The success of female workers in Lüda in learning technology is inseparable from their cultural learning.
    Fourth, because they are literate and have culture, female workers' work ability has been improved. Many female workers with long service, technology, and prestige have been promoted to administrative and trade union cadres. Wang Guixiu, a female worker at the rubber factory, was originally an illiterate. Now she has studied to the fourth grade and can read newspapers, read documents, keep work diaries, and write plans and summaries. She has been promoted to the head of the factory's administrative department and was elected as the female worker minister of the trade union.
    However, due to the limitations of material conditions and other reasons, the learning problems of a small number of married female workers have not been well taken care of and completely resolved. For example, the female workers with children in Jin Textile Factory and Fishing Net Factory, although there are nurseries to take care of their children during study time, are still affected by housework and children when they return home, and have less time to review. When working night shifts, they have to take care of their children during the day, and only sleep for four or five hours at most, without sufficient rest, so that they cannot concentrate when studying. Sometimes when children are sick, mothers have to ask for leave, and teachers do not provide special care and help. As a result, the achievements of married female workers cannot keep up with the general level. The results of the Jin Textile Factory's June term exams were particularly poor for female workers with children. Generally, young female workers have been promoted to the third and fourth grades after one and a half years of study, while married female workers are mostly still in the first and second grades. Therefore, according to the original plan, the second year will complete the fourth grade and eliminate illiteracy, but this small number of female workers will not be easy to do. In other factories, there are also cases where female workers with children cannot participate in learning at all because the scope of nurseries is too small or there are no conditions to set up nurseries. Dalian Textile Factory currently has 71 female workers with children. Because the child-care workers cannot be responsible for taking care of the children during study time, although the mothers have a high enthusiasm for learning, they have also tried to bring their children into the classroom to study, but they did not continue to study because the children disrupted and affected others. Therefore, if this part of the special problems of female workers cannot be well resolved, and more efforts are made to help them overcome the difficulties of children's housework, it will be difficult to fully complete the plan to eliminate illiteracy. Currently, the Women Workers Department of the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions and the administrative departments and trade unions of various factories are beginning to study this issue.

　　旅大女工学了文化以后
    史美玫
    旅大地区自一九四九年春开展识字运动后，由于领导上的重视，一方面进行广泛深入的宣传动员，启发女工的学习热情与要求；另一方面尽量照顾女工的特殊困难，使女工们也同样的卷入了这一文化学习的热潮中。经过一年余的时间，已获得了显著的成绩。据旅大总工会今年六月的不完全统计：在九千一百十五名女工文盲中，参加文化学习的有八千六百四十八名，占百分之九十四·八。一般识三百至六百字的有三千四百人，占学习总人数百分之三十九；识六百至一千二百字的五千一百五十七人，占学习人数的百分之六十；识一千二百字以上的九十一人，其中个别女工有识到三千多字的。去年十一月识字创模运动中，受奖的工人识字模范四百六十三名，其中女工共有一百四十一名，占百分之三十（女工人数仅占工人总数百分之十五）。
    几千年来，女工和所有的妇女一样，在封建统治下做着会说话的牛马，被剥夺了学习的机会。今天，她们在政治上站起来了，当了国家社会的主人，也开始在文化上求得翻身。以旅大来看，当她们初步获得了文化的武器后，在各方面的表现都完全不同了。
    第一、因为识了字，有了文化，女工接受新事物的能力和她们的政治水平都提高了。正如她们自己所说：“过去听讲政治课，也知道是个理，就是听不真，记不清。现在识了字，真好像脑瓜开了窍似的，不但听报告不糊涂，还能记下，回来详细讨论研究，懂得了很多革命道理。”并且能经常看书看报，对国家大事、政治形势也关心多了。她们深刻体会了“没有党和领袖来领导斗争，她们是不会像今天这样在政治、经济、文化上翻身的！”
    第二、女工识字以后，能够详细了解生产竞赛中的成绩，提高了她们的生产积极性。金纺整经女工孙桂秋，过去不识字，经过布告板前站也不敢站，怕看不明白让人笑话。现在认字多了，每天上下班时，抢着站到布告前仔细地看清每个人的生产成绩，心里盘算着如何超过那最高纪录。她六月份还因提高产品质量，得了百分之十五的奖金。三织甲卷纱女工刘桂英进厂三年多，不知道究竟自己每天产量多少。识字以后，她能看懂生产成绩表，知道自己产量比别人差，就加劲干。过去每天十小时工作产纱九十公斤，现在每天七小时半工作产纱一百一十公斤。胶皮工厂女工王桂花，在开展新纪录运动时，听了工会干部的传达还不大明白，后来看到报纸上别的工厂已经创出了新纪录，她才知道只要提高产量超过最高标准就是新纪录。她就努力想法把产量从每天七十双提高到一百二十双。
    第三、因为识字，有了文化，减少了女工学习技术理论的困难，也增强了她们的学习信心。旅大特等识字模范，度量衡工厂的刘美兰，原来是文盲，参加学习后识了三千多字，学习技术非常快，三个月的时间学会了画图，做自动秤盘子，修理汽表的全部技术，提出两次合理化建议，并带了一个徒弟。金属机械厂文盲女工王瑞兰，因为努力学习，在一年半的时间里识了三千多字，学会了算术，听老师讲技术理论能记录下来，回家复习。今年考实活和技术理论时，她是在十一个学徒中成绩最好的。旅大女工学习技术有这样的成绩，与她们的文化学习是分不开的。
    第四、因为识字有了文化，女工的工作能力提高了。很多工龄长、有技术、有威信的女工被提拔为行政和工会的干部。胶皮厂女工王桂秀本是一个大字不识的文盲，现在学习到了四年级，能看报、读文件、记工作日记，写计划和总结，已经被提升为该厂行政跑?部的部长，当选了工会的女工部长。
    但由于物质条件的限制和其他原因，一小部分已婚女工的学习问题，还没有得到很好的照顾和完全解决。如金纺和渔网厂的带孩子的女工，虽有托儿所在学习时间代为照顾孩子，但回家后仍受家务牵扯，孩子拖累，复习时间少。上夜班的时候，白天要带孩子，最多只睡四、五小时，没有充分休息，以致学习时精力不能集中。有时孩子生病，母亲还不得不请假脱课，教师又没有特别照顾帮助。结果使已婚女工的成绩赶不上一般水平。金纺今年六月份期考，带孩子的女工的成绩特别差，一般青年女工经过一年半时间的学习，都已升入三、四年级了，而已婚女工却大多还在一、二年级。所以，按原来计划，二年念完四年级，消灭文盲，但这一小部分女工就不容易做到。其他各厂，还有因为托儿所范围过小，或没条件设立托儿所，以致有孩子的女工根本没能参加学习。大连纺纱厂现有七十一名有孩子的女工，因保育员不能在学习时间负责照顾孩子，母亲学习热情虽高，也曾经尝试抱着孩子进课堂学习，终因孩子扰乱，影响别人，因而没有继续学习。因此，如果不能很好解决这一部分女工的特殊问题，多加一把力帮助她们克服孩子家务的困难，就很难全部完成消灭文盲的计划。现旅大总工会女工部和各厂行政上和工会正在开始研究这一问题。
