　　Japanese Workers and Peasants Relief Association
    Appeals to People Worldwide for Aid to "Mitaka Incident" Defendants
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese Workers and Peasants Relief Association, regarding the Japanese reactionary prosecution authorities' request to the court to sentence the innocent defendants in the "Mitaka Incident" to death or severe punishment, issued an appeal to freedom- and peace-loving people worldwide on June 19. The appeal stated that despite 51 court hearings since last November, it has not been proven whether the train accident was due to an accidental disaster or intentional sabotage. However, the prosecutors, disregarding all facts, requested the court to sentence three defendants, including Iida Shichizo, to death, two defendants, including Yokoya Takeo, to life imprisonment, and the other six defendants to prison terms ranging from eight to fifteen years.
    The appeal pointed out that the Japanese prosecution authorities' request to sentence innocent workers to death is a challenge to precious lives and peace- and freedom-loving people worldwide. The Japanese Workers and Peasants Relief Association requests that all freedom- and peace-loving people worldwide provide support and promptly lodge protests with the Yoshida government, demanding the immediate acquittal and release of the twelve defendants.
    Note: The so-called "Mitaka Incident" occurred on July 15 of last year. On that evening, at Mitaka Station in the suburbs of Tokyo, an unmanned train crashed into the station, damaging part of the station's buildings and causing injuries and deaths to more than ten people. After the incident, Japanese prosecution and police authorities, without any evidence, announced that the incident was a "conspiracy" of the Japanese Communist Party and successively arrested more than ten workers and conducted illegal interrogations.

    向全世界人民发出呼吁书要求援救“三鹰事件”被告
    【新华社七日讯】东京迟到消息：日本工农救济联合会就日本反动检察当局要求法庭对“三鹰事件”的无辜被告判处死刑或重刑一事，于六月十九日向全世界爱好自由与和平的人民发出呼吁书。该呼吁书称：尽管自去年十一月以来，法院开庭五十一次，并未能证明火车失事到底是由于意外灾难，还是有意破坏，但检察官竟不顾各种事实，要求法庭对饭田七三等三名被告判处死刑，横谷武男等两名被告判处无期徒刑，其他六名被告分别判处八年至十五年长期徒刑。
    呼吁书指出：日本检察当局要求对无辜工人判处死刑，是对全世界珍贵生命、爱好和平自由的人民的挑战，日本工农救济联合会要求全世界爱好自由和平的人民予以声援，迅速向吉田政府提出抗议，要求将该十二名被告，立即宣告无罪释放。
    按：所谓“三鹰事件”发生于去年七月十五日。当日晚上，在东京近郊的三鹰车站，有一辆无人火车冲进车站，破坏了车站一部分的房屋，并使十余人伤亡。事件发生后，日本检察及警察当局毫无证据地宣布该事件是日本共产党的“阴谋”，并先后逮捕工人十余人，并进行非法审讯。
