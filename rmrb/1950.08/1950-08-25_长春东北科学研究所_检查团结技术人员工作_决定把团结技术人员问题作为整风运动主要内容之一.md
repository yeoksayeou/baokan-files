　　Changchun Northeast Institute of Science
    Inspecting the Work of Uniting Technical Personnel
    Decides to Make the Issue of Uniting Technical Personnel One of the Main Contents of the Rectification Movement
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Changchun Northeast Institute of Science has preliminarily examined the shortcomings in the work of uniting scientific and technical personnel. The CCP party organization of the institute has decided to make the issue of uniting technical personnel one of the main contents of the rectification movement, deeply examine the work, study documents, and improve ideological understanding, in order to implement the Party's policy of uniting technical personnel. The Changchun Northeast Institute of Science has more than 600 scientific and technical personnel. In the past, although the leadership of the institute recognized the importance of uniting scientific and technical personnel, held discussion meetings, and provided care for technical personnel in their lives, there were shortcomings in promoting democracy, leading political study, and facilitating research work. The opinions and requests raised by technical personnel to the leadership were not resolved in a timely manner or given appropriate explanations, causing them to have some misunderstandings or estrangement from the leadership. For example, some technical personnel requested the addition of instruments, but sometimes they could not be bought or were bought slowly, and no timely explanation was given, leading them to believe that the leadership did not adopt their opinions. Some technical personnel made suggestions on the work of the trade union, but some leading comrades did not study them properly, but one-sidedly emphasized that the attitude of making suggestions was not good and refuted them. The leadership lacked appropriate praise and encouragement for the merits of technical personnel in their work, and sometimes one-sidedly criticized shortcomings in their lives and work style. In leading study, there was also a tendency to be overeager. For example, when studying political economy initially, some comrades were not enthusiastic about learning, and the leading comrades did not study and improve the learning methods well, but instead proposed at the study group meeting that those who were lax in learning should be expelled from the study group. The management personnel of the institute's library lacked experience, and the system was not sound. The leadership did not think of ways to improve library management, but instead stipulated some unrealistic procedures, which often caused technical personnel to run back and forth many times to find a material, wasting time and increasing the trouble of research work. The leadership of the institute has decided to further examine and correct these shortcomings in the rectification movement.

    检查团结技术人员工作
    决定把团结技术人员问题作为整风运动主要内容之一
    【本报讯】长春市东北科学研究所，初步检查团结科学技术人员工作中的缺点。该所中共党组织决定把团结技术人员问题，作为整风运动主要内容之一，深入检查工作，学习文件，提高思想认识，以贯彻党的团结技术人员政策。长春东北科学研究所拥有科学技术人员六百余人，过去该所领导上虽认识到团结科学技术人员的重要，召开过座谈会，并在生活上予技术人员以照顾。但在发扬民主，领导政治学习，便利研究工作等方面都有缺点。技术人员对领导上提出的意见和要求，没有及时解决或作适当的解释，使他们对领导上有些误解或隔膜。如有的技术人员要求添置仪器，有时买不到或买得慢，又没有及时解释原因，使他们认为领导上不采纳意见。有的技术人员对工会工作提意见，某些领导同志竟不好好地加以研究，而片面地强调提意见的态度不好，加以反驳。领导上对技术人员工作上的优点缺乏适当的表扬和鼓励，有时片面地批评生活上、作风上的缺点。在领导学习方面，也发生操之过急的偏向。如最初学习政治经济学时，某些同志学习不起劲，领导同志没有很好地研究改进学习方法，而在学习小组会上提出：学习松懈的要开除出学习组。该所图书馆的管理人员缺乏经验，制度也不健全，领导上不从改进图书管理上想办法，反而规定一些不切实际的手续，使技术人员往往为找一个材料，来回跑许多次，浪费时间，增加研究工作的麻烦。这些缺点，该所领导上决定在整风中进一步检查改正。
