　　The Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau Locomotive Section Had Successive Accidents Last Month
　　Lan Ying and Xian Rong Suggest Establishing a System of Rewards, Punishments, and Responsibilities
　　At the end of April, the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Section mobilized its employees to launch a "May Day" welcome and large-scale locomotive cleaning campaign, which boosted the morale of all crew members and laid the foundation for a three-month (May, June, July) competition. At the same time, the section also launched a red flag movement, with locomotive teams challenging each other, and a joint labor group was organized within the locomotive guidance team, resulting in no responsibility accidents occurring during the entire month of June.
　　However, starting in July, the section experienced three responsibility accidents in quick succession. On July 9th, locomotive number 冖丂一一五五三 caused a signal overrun accident at Wangguanrentun Station. On July 29th, locomotive number 冖丂一一五一一 caused a water shortage accident at Luowenzao Station. The locomotive driver did not check the water tank or replenish water after leaving the depot in Datong, all the way to Yanggao water replenishment station, and continued driving. As a result, on the 314-kilometer earth slope between Yanggao and Luowenzao, when the fireman pulled the water, he discovered that the water level was already insufficient, and he had to reluctantly drive the train to Luowenzao Station. On July 31st, locomotive number 冖丂一一五二六 caused a wheel hoop burst accident at the 104-kilometer mark between Tumu Langshan.
　　Why did three responsibility accidents occur in succession in July? Of course, the ideological carelessness of individual crew members is one of the causes of the accidents. However, the main reason is that the leadership's work style still has many problems: from the beginning of the great competition movement to the present, the section leadership has only focused on political mobilization work, without paying attention to how to establish, strengthen, and consolidate systematic work systems. Therefore, the implementation of various systems is generally very poor. The experience and lessons learned in the movement have not been well summarized, leaving some work still without a clear direction. The reward and punishment system for staff has not been well established. For example, the division of responsibilities between the director of the train operation section and the guidance drivers is unclear; the guidance drivers' workload is too heavy. Some guidance drivers have raised this issue with the leadership and requested a solution; however, the leadership has not resolved it in a timely manner. The leadership rarely criticizes guidance drivers for failing to report on time or complete their work. Some deputy directors of the train operation section and guidance drivers sleep on the train after riding along, and the crew members have raised objections to the leadership, but the leadership has not dealt with it in a timely manner. At the same time, the leadership is aware of the good work performance of some guidance drivers but does not commend them. For example, the driver Liu Tieshan, who caused the signal overrun accident on July 9th, had already caused a collision accident in May. Although he made a self-criticism at the time, his ideological understanding was still insufficient. The leadership did not conduct individual talks and education with him, leading to a second responsibility accident. The locomotive crew that caused the water shortage accident on July 29th was not united internally; the leadership had known this for a long time but did not provide necessary assistance. In short, the leadership's failure to clearly define rewards and punishments for cadres and to promote a responsibility system is the fundamental reason why work achievements cannot be consolidated and sustained.
　　Therefore, we suggest that the Zhangjiakou Locomotive Section should clearly delineate the responsibilities of staff at all levels from the director to the driver, strictly implement a level-by-level responsibility system, and establish a systematic reporting system, in order to completely eliminate accidents and effectively improve the work of the section.

### 张家口铁路分局机务段  上月连续发生责任事故  蓝英、羡荣建议建立奖惩和负责制度

　　张家口铁路分局机务段上月连续发生责任事故
    蓝英、羡荣建议建立奖惩和负责制度
    张家口机务段在四月末，发动职工，展开迎接“五一”、实行机车大清扫运动，提高了全体乘务员的情绪，打下了开展五、六、七三个月大竞赛运动的基础。同时，段内又发动了红旗运动，机车队间互相挑战，并在机车指导队内组织了联合劳动组，使六月份全月没出任何责任事故。
    但是，从七月开始，该段又连续发生了三次责任事故。七月九日，冖丂一一五五三号机车在王官人屯站造成冒进信号责任事故。七月二十九日，冖丂一一五一一号机车在罗文皂站又造成机车缺水事故。该机车司机在大同出库给水后，一直到阳高补水站都没有验看水柜，也不补水，就又行开车。结果，机车到阳高罗文皂间三一四公里土坡，司炉拉水时验看水柜，才发觉水量早已不够，只得敷衍着把车开到罗文皂站。七月三十一日，冖丂一一五二六号机车在土木狼山间一○四公里，又造成机车轮箍崩裂的事故。
    为什么七月份会接连发生了三次责任事故呢？当然，个别乘务员思想上麻痹大意，是发生事故的原因之一。但主要的原因是领导上工作作风还存在着不少问题：从大竞赛运动开始到现在，该段领导上只偏重于政治鼓动工作，没有注意到如何树立、加强和巩固系统的工作制度。因此，各种制度的执行，一般做得很差。对于运动中所得到的经验教训也没有很好的总结出来，使某些工作至今还没有头绪。对于工作人员的奖惩制度，也没有很好建立。例如，行车股的主任与指导司机间，职责范围划分不明确；指导司机的工作太重。某些指导司机曾向领导上提出这个问题，要求解决；但领导上也没有及时解决。指导司机不按时作汇报，工作完不成时，领导上很少加以批评。某些行车股副主任和指导司机添乘后却在车上睡觉，乘务员向领导上提出意见，领导上也没有及时的处理。同时，对工作成绩好的指导司机，领导上知道了也不作表扬。又如在七月九日发生冒进信号事故的司机刘铁山，在五月份已曾出了一次撞车事故，当时本人虽然作了检讨，但他的思想认识还是很不够的。领导上对他也没有进行个别谈话与教育，以至第二次又发生了责任事故。二十九日造成机车缺水事故的机车班，内部不够团结；领导上早就知道，但没有进行必要的帮助。总之，领导上对干部奖惩不严明，不推行负责制，是工作成绩不能巩固持久的基本原因。
    因此，我们建议：张家口机务段应明确地划清由主任至司机长间各级工作人员的职责，严格实行逐级负责制，并建立系统的汇报制度，以争取彻底消灭事故，切实改进该段工作。
