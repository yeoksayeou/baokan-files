How New China Fights Disease
	Introduction to the National Health and Pharmaceutical Exhibition (Part 1)
	By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

	(I) The rulers of old China plunged the people into the sea of suffering from disease and death
	Upon entering the National Health and Pharmaceutical Exhibition, one is confronted with a terrifying number: approximately 14 million Chinese people die each year, and about 140 million are constantly ill!
	From the exhibition, it is clear that the feudalism that had weighed on the Chinese people for thousands of years, the imperialism that sucked the blood of the Chinese people for over a hundred years, and the bureaucrat-capitalism of the past twenty years are the cause of this profound disaster to the Chinese people. Their cruel exploitation of the Chinese people forced the vast majority of them to live in long-term poverty, semi-starvation, and without any hygiene or nutrition. This is the fundamental reason for such high rates of disease and death. The reactionary rulers' "benevolent policies" in medicine and pharmaceutical manufacturing not only did not alleviate, but actually increased the people's illness and death. Look at these fortune-telling tubes, talismans, puppets, and idols on the table – these are feudalism, murder weapons harming the Chinese people. The vast majority of the five million infants and five hundred thousand mothers who die each year die from using old-fashioned midwifery, suffering from postpartum diseases and puerperal fever. Imperialists unscrupulously used medicine as a tool to deliver invisible killing weapons. Looking at the pictures exhibited at the venue showing British imperialism sending opium with cannons, Japanese imperialism colluding with the bandit Yen Xishan to openly manufacture and monopolize "anti-smoking pills" (i.e., opium), and American imperialism stamping "for export only" on large quantities of substandard fake drugs dumped on the Chinese market (American law stipulates that general drugs must be inspected and qualified before they can be sold in the domestic market, but drugs stamped "for export only" are exempt from inspection; many of these drugs are substandard and fake), aroused great indignation among visitors.

	(II) How New China Fights Disease
	Implement the policy of prevention first, and launch large-scale epidemic prevention work
	New China, having defeated imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, must also defeat poverty, backwardness, disease, and death, first by declaring war on the infectious diseases that pose the greatest threat to the health of the Chinese people. After the establishment of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, a large-scale immunization campaign was launched nationwide. From January to July 1950, a total of 50 million people across the country were vaccinated against smallpox and inoculated against cholera, typhoid, diphtheria, plague, and other major infectious diseases, accounting for approximately one-tenth of the entire Chinese population.

	Establish a healthcare network
	To implement the policy of prevention first, many regions have gradually established healthcare networks at all levels, from urban to rural areas, from factories and mines to transportation lines. This is one of the powerful measures taken by New China to overcome disease and death. The work of the advanced Northeast region in establishing health experimental zones from points to areas in a series of factories, mines, cities, rural areas, and railways is introduced at the exhibition. In these experimental zones, health and prevention work such as immunization, smallpox vaccination propaganda, health check-ups, and epidemic reporting have become the central work of all health institutions.

	Orient towards rural areas, factories, mines, and ethnic minorities
	Orienting towards rural areas, factories, mines, and ethnic minorities is one of the important characteristics of New China's health work. The clean farmhouses in the Nehe Health Experimental County of Heilongjiang and the installation model of the Anshan Standard Machinery Factory open up a beautiful prospect for a prosperous factory and rural life in New China before the visitors. The first modern medical team also came to the Chen Barag Banner on the Mongolian grasslands to carry out the struggle to eliminate diseases for the Mongolian people. Here, due to the rule of the Kuomintang's great Han chauvinism and the exploitation of the local feudal ruling class, the fertile grasslands were once filled with the shadow of death. Twenty-five years ago, there were more than 7,000 people here, but now there are only more than 4,000. It can be believed that from now on, the population and livestock here will grow as luxuriantly as the pasture on the grasslands.

	Unite and transform traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and midwives, and cultivate and train fresh healthcare forces
	The exhibition introduces the situation of many traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and midwives being organized to participate in learning, participate in epidemic prevention, establish cooperative clinics of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and practice new-style midwifery. In the past year, a total of 23,044 midwives have been trained in various places. As a result of their implementation of new-style midwifery, the infant mortality rate has dropped from the original 50 percent to about 15 percent – which is equivalent to adding several million people to China's population each year.

	One of the determining conditions for the struggle tasks of New China's health cause is the cultivation and training of a large number of fresh healthcare forces. The new teaching system and teaching methods – the specialized focus system and the visual teaching method – have been practiced in some national medical colleges. The large number of exquisite specimens, models, charts, and instruments displayed by the China Medical University, Harbin Medical University, Changchun, and Tianjin Military Medical University vividly and powerfully illustrate the advantages of implementing the new school system. According to the plan of the Central Ministry of Health, implementing such a school system and teaching method will cultivate 20,000 senior medical personnel, equivalent to what was cultivated in the past 40 years, within five years.

	Rely on our own efforts to develop the pharmaceutical and equipment production industry
	The material guarantee for carrying out the health work of New China is self-reliance and the development of the pharmaceutical equipment production industry. The foundation of self-reliance lies in China's rich source of medicinal materials. The exhibited rhubarb, licorice, ephedra, angelica, gallnut, etc., which have been proven to have significant value in medicine, as well as a large number of minerals from which drugs can be extracted, have attracted people's attention. The glorious history of the old liberated areas overcoming all difficulties and establishing a pharmaceutical industry in the cruel "mopping-up" environment has also encouraged people's confidence in the victory of developing the pharmaceutical industry. The domestically produced penicillin from Chinese pharmaceutical factories and the sophisticated microscopes manufactured by the Chinese Academy of Sciences displayed in the exhibition symbolize the unlimited development prospects of China's pharmaceutical equipment production industry.

　　新中国怎样和疾病作斗争
    全国卫生医药展览会介绍之一
    本报记者  金凤
    （一）旧中国统治者使人民陷于疾病、死亡的苦海
    一走进全国卫生医药展览会会场，看到的是一笔可怕的数字：中国人民每年死亡约一千四百万人，继续不断生病的约达一亿四千万人！
    从展览会上，人们可以清楚地看出：带给中国人民这样深重灾难的是几千年来压在中国人民头上的封建主义、一百多年以及近二十年来吮吸着中国人民鲜血的帝国主义和官僚资本主义。它们对于中国人民惨酷的剥削，使得绝大多数中国人民只能长期过着贫困的、半饥饿的、不能讲求任何卫生和营养的生活，这就是造成这样巨大的疾病率和死亡率的根本原因，而反动统治者在医药治疗、药材制造方面的“德政”，则不但没有减轻、反而增加了人民的疾病和死亡。看一看桌子上的这些签筒、符咒、木偶、神像吧，这些都是封建主义，坑害着中国人民的杀人武器。每年死亡的五百万婴孩和五十万产妇，绝大多数是因为使用旧法接生，害着四六风和产褥热而死亡的。帝国主义者则以医药为名，毒辣无耻地输送着无形的杀人武器。看着会场上展览着的英国帝国主义以大炮送进鸦片的图画，日本帝国主义勾结阎匪锡山公开制造和专卖“戒烟丸”（即鸦片），以及美国帝国主义盖着“只供出口”的印戳、大批倾销到中国市场上来的不合格的伪药（美国法律规定：一般药品都要经过检验合格才能在国内市场上出卖，但盖着“只供出口”印戳的药品就可不受检验。这些药品很多是不合格的伪药）的罪证，引起了参观者极大的愤慨。
    （二）新中国怎样和疾病作斗争
    贯彻预防为主的方针，大规模展开防疫工作
    战胜了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的新中国，还必须要战胜贫困、落后、疾病和死亡，首先就是对着威胁中国人民健康最大的传染病宣战。中央人民政府卫生部成立后，在全国展开了大规模的防疫注射运动。一九五○年一月到七月，全国各地接种牛痘和注射霍乱、伤寒、白喉、鼠疫等几种主要传染病的预防针的人数共计有五千万，约占全中国人口十分之一。
    成立保健工作网
    贯彻预防为主的方针，许多地区已逐渐成立由城市到乡村，由工矿到交通线的各级保健工作网。这是新中国战胜疾病、死亡的有力措施之一。先进的东北地区在一系列的工矿、城市、农村以及铁道线上由点到面所建立的卫生实验区的工作，在展览会上介绍出来。在这些实验区里，预防注射、种痘宣传、健康检查、疫情通报等保健预防工作，已成为所有卫生机构的中心工作。
    面向农村、工矿和少数民族
    面向农村、工矿和少数民族，是新中国卫生工作重要特点之一。黑龙江讷河卫生实验县的清洁农舍以及鞍山标准机械工厂的装置模型，在参观者的面前开拓了新中国一个工厂、农村丁财两旺的美丽远景。第一支近代化的医疗队，也来到蒙古草原的陈包虎旗，为蒙古人民进行着驱除疾病的斗争。在这里，由于国民党大民族主义的统治和当地封建统治阶级的剥削，丰腴的草原上曾满布了死亡的阴影。二十五年前这里有七千多人，如今只剩了四千多人。可以相信，从今以后，这地方的人口和牛马，会像草原的牧草一样茂盛地生长起来。
    团结、改造中医和接生婆，培养、训练保健生力军
    展览会介绍了许多中医和接生婆组织起来参加学习、参加防疫、成立中西医药合作社、用新法接生的情形。最近一年来各地共训练了二万三千零四十四个接生婆，由她们施行新法接生的结果，婴儿死亡率已由原来的百分之五十降到百分之十五左右——这等于中国每年多增加了好几百万人口。
    围绕着新中国卫生事业的斗争任务的决定条件之一，是培养和训练大批保健生力军。新的教学制度和教学法——专科重点制和形象教学法已经在一些国立医学院里实践着。陈列着的中国医大、哈尔滨医大、长春、天津军医大学的大批精美的标本、模型、图表和仪器，生动有力地说明着施行新学制的优点。根据中央卫生部的计划，执行着这样的学制和教学法，将在五年内培养出相当于过去四十年所培养的二万名高级医务人材来。
    自力更生，发展医药、器材生产事业
    开展新中国卫生工作的物质保证是自力更生，发展医药器材生产事业。自力更生的基础，在于中国蕴藏着丰富的药材源泉。展览着的大黄、甘草、麻黄、当归、五倍子等已经证明在医药学上有着重大价值的药草以及大批可以提炼药物的矿物，吸引了人们的注意。老解放区克服一切困难，在残酷的“扫荡”环境中建立起制药事业的光荣历史，也鼓舞了人们对于发展制药事业的胜利信心。展览品中我国药厂自制的盘尼西林以及中国科学院制造的精致显微镜，更象征了中国医药器材生产事业无限的发展前途。
