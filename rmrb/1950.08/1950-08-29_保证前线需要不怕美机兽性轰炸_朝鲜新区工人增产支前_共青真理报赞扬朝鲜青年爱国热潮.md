Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 28th: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Seoul: Workers in the newly liberated areas of southern Korea are actively engaged in restoring production, regardless of the bestial bombing by American aircraft, to ensure the needs of the front lines. Workers in the Seoul area factories actively launched an increase production campaign around August 15th. Workers and technicians at a certain factory held an "Increase Production Week" from August 14th to 18th, increasing output by 60 percent. Workers at another factory worked day and night and have now completely restored the destroyed factory, exceeding the production plan by 140 percent daily.

TASS, Moscow, August 26th: "Komsomol Truth" correspondent in Pyongyang, D. Dibapov, wrote an article entitled "Korean Youth in War": Since the outbreak of the war, hundreds of thousands of patriotic Korean youth have joined the People's Army. Young male and female workers have formed countless support-the-front teams. Workers and employees guarantee to work ten to twelve hours a day, even on their days off. Tens of thousands of girls are studying in nursing training courses or have joined field armies, and hundreds of thousands of young women are sewing military uniforms from morning to night. Youth in rural areas have sent 12,000 of their best representatives to factories, plants, and mines to replace workers who have gone to the front lines.

Many young workers voluntarily continue to work at their posts during air raid alarms, regardless of how frequent the alarms are. Rescue teams have been established in all enterprises, and their main purpose is to rescue people's buildings and property during air raids. Once a bomb explodes, the rescue team immediately arrives at the site of the destruction and begins their heroic work.

Youth in the rear have launched a donation campaign to collect funds to manufacture tanks and aircraft. This movement has become a mass movement. The fundraising effort has been successful. The tank column and aircraft squadron are named "Youth." Patriotic youth have also collected hundreds of thousands of gifts for the front lines.

The People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea mostly consists of young workers and peasants. Many soldiers of the People's Army are members of the Democratic Youth League or were recently members and are now members of the Workers' Party. Young people have demonstrated collective heroism on the front lines. Thousands of young soldiers have received medals and orders of the Republic. Of the first nineteen heroes of the Republic, sixteen are members of the Democratic Youth League. Young female nurses have also demonstrated great heroism and unyieldingness. They have saved the lives of thousands of People's Army soldiers wounded in various battles.

Dibapov concluded by writing: The collective heroism demonstrated by Korean youth on the front lines and in the rear demonstrates the lofty sentiments of Korean youth patriotism. Undoubtedly, Korean youth, together with the entire people, will surely defeat the American aggressors.

　　保证前线需要不怕美机兽性轰炸
    朝鲜新区工人增产支前
    共青真理报赞扬朝鲜青年爱国热潮
    【新华社平壤二十八日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社汉城讯：朝鲜南半部新解放地区的工人为保证前线的需要，正不顾美机的兽性轰炸而积极展开恢复生产的工作。汉城地区各工厂的工人，在“八、一五”前后，积极展开增产斗争。某工厂工人、技师，在从八月十四日到十八日的五天中举行“增产周”，产量提高了百分之六十。另一工厂的工人不分昼夜地工作，现已完全恢复了被破坏的工厂，每天以百分之一百四十的产量超额完成着生产计划。
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：“共青真理报”驻平壤记者狄巴波夫以《战争中的朝鲜青年》为题写道：自从战争爆发以来，朝鲜数十万爱国青年已经参加人民军。青年男女工人组成了无数的支援前线队。工人们和雇员们即使在他们的例假日，也保证每天工作十到十二小时。数万少女在护士训练班学习，或已加入野战军工作，从清晨到深夜，数十万青年妇女不停地在缝制军服。乡区的青年派遣了他们一万二千名最优秀的代表到各工场、工厂和矿山里去接替到前线去的工人的工作。
    很多青年工人不管警报如何频繁，自愿在空袭警报中继续留在岗位上工作。所有企业中均已建立了救护队，它们的主要目的是在空袭中抢救人民的建筑和财产。一旦炸弹爆炸，救护队立即到达破坏地点，开始他们的英雄的工作。
    后方的青年们发动了收集制造坦克和飞机的捐款。这个运动业已成为群众性的运动。募款工作，已经获得成就。这个坦克纵队和飞机大队即以“青年”二字命名。爱国青年并已为前线收集了数十万件礼物。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的人民军，大多数为青年工农。很多人民军的战士都是民主青年同盟的盟员，或不久以前还是盟员而现在变成了劳动党的党员。青年人在前线上表现了集体的英雄主义。数千青年士兵获得了共和国的奖章和勋章。共和国第一批十九个英雄中，有十六个是民主青年同盟的盟员。青年的女看护们也表现了伟大的英雄主义和坚强不屈。他们救活了在各次战役中受伤的数千人民军士兵的生命。
    狄巴波夫在结语中写道：朝鲜青年在前线和后方所表现的集体英雄主义，说明了朝鲜青年爱国主义的崇高情感。无疑的，朝鲜青年和全体人民一起，一定会击溃美国侵略者。
