Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Sixty-two percent of commanders, combatants, political work personnel, and logistics staff in the People's Liberation Army North China Military Region troops have signed the peace declaration.

Before the signing, all units conducted in-depth publicity and education, enabling all personnel to deeply understand the great significance of the signature campaign to defend world peace. Each unit of a certain army undertaking the Jun River task held meetings in advance to study the key points of education. Large classes were held twice at the battalion level, and then meetings were held in groups for discussions. After the signing began, commanders and fighters eagerly competed to write their names in the signature book. Some units also held solemn and grand oath-taking rallies to defend peace. Many soldiers automatically mobilized residents and family members to sign.

This signature campaign is a good education in patriotism and internationalism for the troops. Through this campaign, commanders and fighters have further clarified their understanding of the growing strength of the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union; and recognized the consistency of defending China and defending world peace. For example, the soldiers of the First Platoon of a certain artillery company of the Pingyuan Provincial Military Region wrote on the signature book: "We will always be a fighting team, resolutely defend the motherland, defend world peace, and take practical actions to eliminate illiteracy and improve artillery technology."

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th: The peace signature campaign in Gansu Province has developed from major cities to the vast rural and ethnic minority areas. As of now, 550,000 people in the province have signed the peace declaration. In Lanzhou City, the number of people of all ethnic groups from all walks of life who have signed has reached 200,000, accounting for five-sixths of the city's total population. Among them, more than 18,000 are housewives. They brought their children to the signing location to sign their names. People of Hui and Tibetan ethnicities in Linxia, Wuwei, Yongdeng, Jiuquan and other places enthusiastically participated in the peace signature campaign. According to incomplete statistics, more than 132,000 people of all ethnic groups in the Linxia district and 160,000 people in the Wuwei district have signed. In addition, the number of signatories in Shandan County has accounted for about 85% of the county's total population. In Qingyang Xifeng Town, among the more than 6,000 signatories, 150 households signed as entire families.

    【新华社十日讯】人民解放军华北军区部队已有百分之六十二的指挥员、战斗员和政治工作、后勤工作人员在和平宣言上签名。
    在签名前各部队都进行了深入的宣传教育，使所有人员深刻认识保卫世界和平签名运动的伟大意义。某军担任浚河任务的各部队，事前都开会研究了教育的重点，以营为单位上了两次大课，然后分班开会座谈。签名开始后，指战员们都热烈地争先把自己的名字写在签名册上。有的单位还举行了庄严隆重的保卫和平宣誓大会。许多战士自动地动员了居民和家属签名。
    这次签名运动，是部队的爱国主义和国际主义的一个很好的教育。经过这次运动，指战员们都进一步地明确认识了以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营的日益壮大；认清了保卫中国与保卫世界和平的一致性。如平原省军区某炮兵连一班战士们在签名书上写着：“我们永远是战斗队，坚决保卫祖国，保卫世界和平，要以实际行动消灭文盲，提高炮兵技术。”
    【新华社西安十日电】甘肃省和平签名运动已从各主要城市向广大农村和少数民族地区深入发展。截至目前止，全省已有五十五万人在和平宣言上签名。该省兰州市各族各界人民签名的已达二十万人，占全市人口总数的六分之五。其中有一万八千多人为家庭妇女。她们携儿带女地涌至签名处签上自己的名字。临夏、武威、永登、酒泉等地回、藏人民均热烈参加和平签名。据不完全统计，临夏分区各族人民已有十三万二千余人签名，武威分区已有十六万人签名。此外，山丹县签名人数已占全县人口总数的百分之八十五左右。庆阳西峰镇在签名的六千多人中，全家签名的即有一百五十户。
