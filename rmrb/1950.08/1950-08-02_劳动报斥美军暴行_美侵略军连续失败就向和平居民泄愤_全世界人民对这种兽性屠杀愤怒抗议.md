　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 1st:  西明 (Ximing) published a special article in Labor Daily entitled "The Korean People Will Not Forget This," discussing the atrocities committed by the U.S. aggressors against the people of Korean towns and villages as they vented their anger due to battlefield failures. Ximing stated: General MacArthur, in order to cover up battlefield failures, boasted of victories over peaceful residents.

　　If a person reads the news sent by reporters from Korea, or listens to radio broadcasts from Korea, they would undoubtedly compare the actions of the American army to those of the Hitler bandit troops:  equally inhuman atrocities, sadism, bestial massacres of defenseless people, equally barbaric bombings and killings of entirely innocent citizens.

　　Reports from foreign journalists published by Xinhua News Agency pointed out that American planes destroyed 1,088 houses in Wonsan. Among those killed in these rubble heaps were 1,249 people, mostly children and women. The bombing of Pyongyang and its suburbs on July 23rd was no less brutal.

　　New York Times reporter Sullyvan admitted: American aggressors, under the pretext of fighting guerrillas, are destroying villages and shooting every Korean appearing in civilian clothes in the combat zone. The interventionists have established 58 concentration camps in the lands they occupy, imprisoning nearly 380,000 Koreans.

　　The working people of all countries, democrats, and honest men and women around the world, unanimously demand with anger: "Drive the American interventionists out of Korea! Severely punish the butchers who murder women and children!"

　　劳动报斥美军暴行
    美侵略军连续失败就向和平居民泄愤
    全世界人民对这种兽性屠杀愤怒抗议
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：西明在劳动报上发表题为《朝鲜人民是不会忘记这件事》的专文，论述因在战场上失败而泄愤的美国侵略者对朝鲜城镇和乡村的人民所施的暴行。西明称：麦克阿瑟将军为了掩饰在战场上的失败，夸耀对和平居民的胜利。
    一个人如果读到记者从朝鲜发出的消息，或者听到来自朝鲜的无线电广播，就会毫无异议地把美国军队的行为比做希特勒匪军的行动：同样不人道的暴行，淫虐狂，对无防御的人民之兽性的屠杀，同样野蛮的轰炸和杀害全部无辜公民。
    新华社所发表的外国记者的报道，指出美国飞机在元山炸毁了一千零八十八所房屋。在这些瓦砾堆中被炸死的人民有一千二百四十九人，大部分是儿童和妇女。七月二十三日对平壤及其近郊的轰炸，其残暴的程度也毫无逊色。
    纽约时报的记者苏里汶承认：美国侵略者们以对游击队斗争为借口，正在毁灭各村庄并枪杀穿着平民衣服在交战地带出现的每一个朝鲜人。干涉者们在他们所占据的土地上，设立了五十八座集中营，囚禁了将近三十八万朝鲜人。
    各国的劳动人民，民主人士，全世界的诚实的男女们，一致愤怒地要求：“把美国干涉者赶出朝鲜去！严惩杀害妇女和儿童的屠户们！”
