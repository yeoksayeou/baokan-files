　　Some Suggestions for the Revised Edition of Revival Biology
　　Wang Yanyuan
　　Written by Chen Zhen, Published by Commercial Press

　　Mr. Chen Zhen’s book “High School Biology” was the textbook I used when I was a student. Now that I am a teacher, I use it as a teaching material for my students. This textbook has nurtured many young people, and its influence is significant, so we should pay attention to this book. Here, I would like to discuss some of my opinions on this year's revised edition.

　　(1) The revised edition of this book has deleted the section on Mendelian genetics and placed the genetics of Michurin and Lysenko in the section on evolution, unlike the previous separate chapter on genetics. This is very good because heredity is a part of evolution and cannot be separated. The eighth chapter, which discusses organisms and the environment, is also appropriate, as it allows students to view issues from a perspective of mutual relationship.

　　(2) When the book talks about the emergence of Darwin's theory, it states that many people tried their best to oppose it at the time, but "… Fortunately, the eloquent biologist Huxley came out as Darwin's defender. After several years of debate, the academic community gradually learned about the evidence presented by Darwin, and the theory of evolution finally achieved victory." I think it would be more appropriate to write about the social background of England at that time—the era of the most prosperous capitalist free competition (1840-1860), because this background is inseparable from the development of biology at that time. Emphasizing the individual role of "Fortunately, the eloquent Huxley" is an incorrect, or at least an incomplete, viewpoint.

　　(3) The book discusses the theory of natural selection. In this respect, it is very obvious that Darwin was influenced by the population theory, and there have been many recent criticisms of it. Here, Mr. Chen has not made appropriate modifications and criticisms. At the beginning, the book still uses the amazing reproduction of carp and paramecium to describe it, and uses the limited space and other living conditions to explain it, without falling back into the old trap of population theory. This part should be thoroughly revised.

　　(4) The sections in the book on the theories of Michurin and Lysenko are concise, and the main theories and methods are included, which I think is suitable for middle school students. However, if some of Michurin and Lysenko's struggle history, their amazing achievements, and contributions to the people are added, and then mention how our agriculture needs to be improved, it will definitely further encourage students' learning enthusiasm. I think such materials are needed in middle school textbooks, as it is a method of linking theory with practice, and further implements the spirit of loving the motherland, loving the people, and loving science required by the new education.

　　(5) When the book discusses the relationship between organisms and the environment, it writes: "The relationship between organisms and the environment is usually passive, dominated by the environment... However, sometimes the relationship between organisms and the environment can also be active, and can also transform the environment to suit their own needs..." Although this is a better statement, it is not clear enough. Originally, writing middle school textbooks should be about integrating correct viewpoints into the description of examples in a simple and understandable way, which is very difficult. The way Mr. Chen writes, sometimes passive and sometimes active, is somewhat ambiguous. It should be said: the environment creates organisms, and organisms can influence the development of the environment.

　　(6) When the book talks about the relationship between different kinds of organisms, regarding camouflage, warning coloration, and mimicry, it writes: "Survival competition is a universal phenomenon in the biological world. For attack and defense, organisms often develop many kinds of adaptations in their physical form. In addition to sharp claws, teeth, horns, and thorns, there are also toxins, camouflage, warning coloration, mimicry, etc." It is not easy to explain camouflage and warning coloration to students completely correctly, and a slight deviation can fall into idealism. If it is explained that in order to attack and defend, organisms have camouflage, warning coloration, and other adaptations, then it seems that the color of the organism is determined by attack and defense. This makes it easier for people to feel that everything is for survival competition. In fact, the color of animals is due to physiological chemical actions (and physical actions), not due to survival competition. However, if the animal's color is obscure and not easily seen, then it is beneficial for survival (which is the so-called camouflage). As for warning coloration, taking poisonous animals as an example, not all animals with toxins have bright colors; some venomous snakes have bright colors, while others are very obscure. In addition, centipedes have red legs, which are clearly colored, but scorpions are very obscure in color, similar to the color of bricks and soil.

　　(7) In the third chapter of the book, "Relationships between Organisms of the Same Species," it mentions: "There is also survival competition and mutual harm between organisms of the same species, but because the abilities of organisms of the same species are equal, it is not easy to distinguish between victory and defeat, so the opportunity for this type of phenomenon to occur is less than among organisms of different species." Lysenko discussed this issue in "The Current State of Biology." Lysenko believes that there is no struggle between individuals of the same species.

　　(8) Finally, in terms of illustrations, there is no picture of Peking Man on page 288, figure 216. Students will raise questions when teaching. I think at least a picture of the skull of "Peking Man" should be added.

### 对复兴生物学修正版的几点意见

　　对复兴生物学修正版的几点意见
    王彦远
    陈桢著  商务印书馆版
    陈桢先生这本“高中生物学”，是我做学生时用的课本，现在我在做教师，又用它做教本教学生了。通过这本教科书已经培养了许多青年，它的影响是很大的，因为这样我们应当重视这一本书。这里想谈谈我对本年修正版的几点意见。
    （一）本书修正版将孟德尔遗传学一部分删去了，同时把米邱林、李森科的遗传学放在演化内来讲，不像过去单有遗传一篇，这是很好的。因为遗传是演化的一部分，是不可割裂的。第八篇讲生物与环境也很得体，这正可以使同学从相互关系上看问题。
    （二）书中讲达尔文学说的出现时，说当时是有很多人尽力反对，但“………幸而有能文善辩的生物学家赫胥黎出来替达尔文作辩护人，经过几年的论战以后，学术界里渐渐的知道了达尔文举出的证据，演化论才得着最后的胜利。”我想这样写不如写点当时英国的社会背景——资本主义自由竞争最盛时代（一八四○——一八六○）较为适当，因为这种背景和当时生物学的发展是分不开的。强调“幸有能文善辩的赫胥黎”的个人作用，是一个不正确的、至少是不完全的观点。
    （三）书中讲天择论，在这方面，很显明的，达尔文是受了人口论的影响的，最近就有很多文献批评过了。这里陈先生没有作适当的修改和批判，在开端时，仍用鲫鱼惊人的繁殖来叙述，用草履虫繁殖来叙述，并引用空间和别种生活条件是有限的这一点来解说，不复重陷于人口论的故辙了，这一部分，还应该彻底修改一下。
    （四）书中写米邱林、李森科的学说的各节，材料都很精简，主要的理论和方法也都能包括了，给中学读我想是适合的。不过如果再加上一些米邱林、李森科的奋斗史以及他们的惊人成就、对人民的贡献，然后再提一些我们农业上是如何的须要改进，这样一定可以更加鼓励学生的学习情绪。我想这样的材料，中学课本里是需要的，这是联系实际的一种方法，更贯彻了新教育所需要的爱祖国、爱人民、爱科学的精神。
    （五）书中讲生物与环境时，写道：“生物与环境的关系，普通是被动的，受环境支配的………。但是有的时候生物与环境的关系也能是主动的，也能改造环境适合自身的需要………。”这虽已是较好的说法了，但说得还不大明确。本来写中学课本是要在描写实例中贯串正确的观点，深入浅出，这是非常难的。像陈先生这样有时写成被动，又有时写成主动，不免有些含混。应该说：环境创造了生物体，生物体又能影响环境的发展。
    （六）书中讲异种生物间的关系，对隐身色、警戒色与拟态等，这样写道：“生存竞争是生物界的一个普遍现象，为了攻击和防卫，生物形体上往往生出很多种的适应。锐利的爪牙角刺之外，又有毒液，隐身色，警戒色，拟态等。”关于隐身色和警戒色等，要向同学解释的完全正确很不容易，稍有偏差就会落入唯心论。如果解释为了攻击和防卫，因而有隐身色、警戒色等适应，那末，好像生物体的颜色是被攻击和防卫决定的。这就更容易使人觉得什么都为生存竞争似的了。实际上动物的色彩，系由于生理上的化学作用（及物理作用），不是由于生存竞争，不过如那动物的颜色隐晦，不容易被看出，那么，对于生存也有利益（就是所谓隐身色）。至于警戒色，举有毒的动物来说，不是有毒液的动物就有鲜明的颜色，毒蛇有的色彩显明，有的也很隐晦。此外，如蜈蚣生着红色的脚，颜色显明，但蝎子颜色很隐晦，与砖石及泥土的颜色很相似。
    （七）书中第三章“同种生物间的关系”，中间谈道：“同种生物之间也有生存竞争互相残害的现象，不过因为同种生物的能力相等，不容易分别胜负，所以发生这类现象的机会，是比在异种生物之中少些。”对于这一问题，李森科的“生物学的现状”中曾讨论到。李森科认为同种生物的个体间是没有斗争的。
    （八）最后，在插图方面，二八八页二一六图没有中国北京猿人图，在教学时同学们会提出疑问来的。我想至少应该增上“北京人”的头盖骨的图。
