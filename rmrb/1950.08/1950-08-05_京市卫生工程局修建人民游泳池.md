After dredging nearly sixty kilometers of rivers and the Central, Southern, and Northern Seas, the Beijing Municipal People's Government Bureau of Public Health Engineering is now undertaking the dredging and bank protection of the Four Seas (Shichahai, Jishuitan), which was not in the original work plan. It is also preparing to build a large People's Swimming Pool in Xixiaohai. The planned pool will be 185 meters long, with an average width of 100 meters and an area of 18,500 square meters, divided into competition, water play, children's, and youth swimming areas.

Furthermore, since July 28th, the bureau has been using explosives in Xijiao Northwest Wang, Si Wangfu and other places to extract 5,000 cubic meters of rubble needed to build the People's Swimming Pool. It will take about a month to complete. Citizens should not be alarmed by the sounds.
