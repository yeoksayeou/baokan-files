　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: The reactionary Yoshida government of Japan, acting on orders from MacArthur, formally issued a decree on the 10th to establish a "Police Reserve Force." This is part of the US's conspiracy to intensify the arming of Japanese fascist forces in order to expand its armed aggression against the people of Asian countries. According to Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, under the decree, this "Police Reserve Force," numbering 75,000, will be directly commanded by the Japanese Prime Minister. The cost of establishing the reserve force is 20 billion yen for this year. Prior to this, the Yoshida Cabinet issued a decree on the 9th to recruit personnel for the "Police Reserve Force." According to this decree, open recruitment is limited to cadres below the level of company commander in the "Reserve Force." Applicants must undergo "ideological examination." Regarding senior cadres of the "Reserve Force," Kyodo News Agency revealed that the Yoshida government is "carefully studying" the public appointment of "purged" fascist professional military officers with experience in commanding troops. They may be appointed as "Director General of the Reserve Force and commanders of troops in Tokyo, Sendai, Osaka, and Fukuoka."

　　At the same time, the "Maritime Safety Agency," which has been publicly ordered by MacArthur to increase its personnel by 8,000, is also actively recruiting soldiers. According to Kyodo News Agency, the first recruitment number was announced on the 9th as 1,570. Among them, 1,100 are maritime service personnel (500 security officers and 600 security team members), and 470 are land service personnel.

　　In addition, the so-called "Railway Public Security Officers" will also be openly armed and their strength expanded. According to Kyodo News Agency, according to the law promulgated and implemented on the 10th, "Railway Public Security Officers" have been permitted to openly carry handguns. The National Railway Public Security Bureau has long purchased approximately 1,000 handguns from the United States, preparing to distribute the guns to the "Railway Public Security Officers" after "sufficient training." At the same time, taking advantage of this opportunity, the strength of the "Railway Public Security Officers" will be openly expanded this year from the current 3,300 to 3,800 to 4,000.

　　服从美国军事化日本的指示
    吉田政府建立“警察后备队”
    “海上保安厅”及“铁道公安官”实力扩充
    【新华社十二日讯】日本吉田反动政府根据麦克阿瑟的命令，于十日正式发布了建立“警察后备队”的法令。这是美国为着扩大对亚洲各国人民的武装侵略而采取的加紧武装日本法西斯势力的阴谋计划的一部分。据共同社东京讯，根据该法令，这个为数达七万五千人的“警察后备队”，将直接由日本首相指挥。建立该后备队的费用，在本年度为二百亿日元。在此以前，吉田内阁于九日发表了招募“警察后备队”人员的法令。根据这一法令，公开招募者限于“后备队”的中队长以下的干部。应征者都要经过“思想考查”。关于“后备队”的高级干部，据共同社透露，吉田政府正在“慎重研究”公开起用被“整肃”的有指挥部队经验的法西斯职业军官。他们可能被任命为“后备队”的“本部长官，以及东京、仙台、大阪、福冈四地的部队长官”。
    同时，奉麦克阿瑟的命令公开增加人员八千名的“海上保安厅”，也在积极进行招募兵员工作。据共同社讯，第一次招募人数已于九日宣布为一千五百七十名。其中海上勤务人员一千一百名（保安官五百名，保安队员六百名），陆上勤务人员四百七十名。
    此外，所谓“铁道公安官”也将公开武装并扩充实力。据共同社讯，根据十日公布实施的法律，“铁道公安官”已被许可公开佩带手枪。国营铁道公安局早就向美国购入手枪约一千枝，准备对“铁道公安官”进行“充分训练”后，将枪枝分发配带。同时，并乘此机会在今年将“铁道公安官”的实力从现在的三千三百名，公开扩充至三千八百名至四千名。
