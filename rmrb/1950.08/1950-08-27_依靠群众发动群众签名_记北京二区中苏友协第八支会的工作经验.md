　　Relying on the Masses to Launch Mass Signatures
    — An Account of the Work Experience of the Eighth Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the Second District of Beijing
    By Our Reporter Tan Wenrui
    In the peace signature campaign in Beijing, the work of the Eighth Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in the Second District is particularly outstanding. They not only mobilized more than 90 percent of the more than 8,000 people within their area to sign, but also carried out publicity in other areas of the city, striving for more signatures. In the two periods from May 18 to July 22 and from July 22 to August 1, a total of 48,540 people were mobilized to sign the peace declaration.
    The significant achievements of the Eighth Branch of the Second District in this peace signature campaign are mainly due to the close relationship between the Eighth Police Station and the masses. The police station regularly helps the masses solve various problems, including helping them study; on the other hand, the masses constantly assist the police station in carrying out cleaning, epidemic prevention, understanding the situation, and maintaining public order. Everyone is as close as a family, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association branch located in the police station has become a "home for the people" that citizen activists frequent. Therefore, after learning about the news of launching the peace signature campaign and recognizing the great significance of the peace signature campaign, they automatically and enthusiastically supported and actively participated in this movement.
    On May 18, the Second District General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association received instructions from the branch and notified the branches to deploy the work of launching the peace signature campaign. Upon receiving the notice, the Eighth Branch immediately wrote blackboard newspapers, set up signature stations, and called on everyone to sign up enthusiastically. Active members, in addition to taking the lead in signing, also organized Yangko dance teams to publicize on the streets. Later, they joined with other branches to form a larger propaganda team, transforming a mobile book cart into a mobile propaganda vehicle, which was decorated with portraits of Chairman Mao and Marshal Stalin, the national flags of China and the Soviet Union, "peace doves," and large slogans such as "Long Live World Peace." This dazzling propaganda vehicle, together with singing teams, Yangko dance teams, and propaganda teams, went to various districts of the city to publicize and mobilize citizens to sign, which had a great effect.
    On June 25, after American imperialism launched an aggression against Korea and interfered in our country's liberation of Taiwan, the Eighth Branch convened a forum of activists, where the branch director Yao Feizhang (police station chief) gave them a report on the Chinese people's determination to oppose the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and the situation of the Korean War. Everyone unanimously decided to expand the publicity work. With the assistance of students from Xinsheng Middle School, the Eighth Branch held a street publicity campaign involving more than 90 people, mobilizing more citizens to sign. During this period, they adopted a method of collective publicity to promote the movement, mobilizing a total of 12,303 people to sign. On July 22, the Second District General Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association specially awarded them a silk banner to commend their outstanding work achievements.
    The words "Continue to Strive for the Defense of World Peace" on the silk banner encouraged the emotions of every peace fighter, and everyone unanimously requested to continue to expand the peace signature campaign. At a forum, they summarized and reviewed the past work, believing that they should not be satisfied with the existing achievements. At the same time, they discovered that the previously adopted method of collective publicity and promotion had the shortcoming of not being thorough enough. Everyone decided to divide into groups to carry out publicity and collect signatures. More than 30 activists were divided into seven groups, and each group elected its own group leader. The next day, they set out separately and proposed competitive challenges, guaranteeing to complete the task.
    Among these more than 30 peace fighters were store clerks, coal shop owners, short-term workers, and housewives, all of whom had extreme enthusiasm for defending world peace. Many people temporarily put aside their work or moved their work to the night to do it, devoting all their daytime hours to the peace signature campaign. Sometimes braving the scorching heat, sometimes braving the heavy rain, they often worked for twelve or thirteen hours a day. Gao Yuquan and Zhang Yangshi, two elderly women in their fifties, were model peace fighters among them.
    The peace fighters individually developed creativity in publicity methods. Some wore slogans such as "Peace Dove" and "Defend World Peace" on their chests, while others used cardboard to create three-dimensional cartoons such as "American Imperialism is Arranging a Grave for Itself" to attract the attention of citizens and then publicize to them. Some groups went deep into the slums, patiently explaining the significance of peace signatures to the masses. Every night, everyone gathered together to report on the day's situation, exchange experiences, and raise the difficulties encountered in the work. Under the leadership of Comrade Yao Feizhang, they held discussions and made summaries, which served as a reference for everyone's work the next day. After a week of work in this way, a total of 26,237 people were mobilized to sign the peace declaration. A group of six people including Deng Shize and Li Chuanyan mobilized more than 10,000 people, and Gao Yuquan and Zhang Yangshi, two elderly women, mobilized more than 8,000 people, all of which were outstanding achievements.
    Recently, these experienced peace fighters, under the leadership of the Eighth Branch, in order to respond to the call of the Chinese People's Congress for the Defense of World Peace to strive for 150 million to 200 million signatures nationwide, decided to continue to vigorously carry out the peace signature campaign. On the 22nd of this month, they held a forum, listened to the instructions of the Second District General Branch, and combined the peace signature campaign with the anti-American imperialist aggression movement. Not only should they strive for more people to sign the peace declaration, but they should also strive for more people to understand the significance of defending world peace and the anti-aggression movement. They decided to adopt a method of individual in-depth publicity and continue to strive for the defense of world peace!

　　依靠群众发动群众签名
    ——记北京二区中苏友协第八支会的工作经验
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    在北京的和平签名运动中，第二区中苏友好协会第八支会的工作成绩是特别突出的。他们不仅发动了本段范围内八千多人口中百分之九十以上签了名，并向市内其他地区展开宣传，争取更多的签名。在五月十八日至七月二十二日，七月二十二日至八月一日两个时期中，一共发动了四万八千五百四十人在和平宣言上签了名。
    第二区第八支会这次在和平签名运动中所获得的显著成绩，主要是由于第八派出所与群众的密切联系。派出所在平时经常替群众解决各种问题，包括帮助他们学习在内；另一方面群众也不断协助派出所进行清洁、防疫、了解情况、维持治安等工作。大家亲密如一家人，设在派出所内的中苏友协支会成了市民积极分子经常出入的“民众之家”。所以他们得悉了发动和平签名运动的消息和认识到和平签名运动的伟大意义以后，就自动地热烈拥护并积极参加这一运动。
    五月十八日，中苏友协第二区总支会接到了分会的指示，就通知各支会布置开展和平签名运动的工作。得到通知的第八支会当即写黑板报，设签名处，号召大家踊跃签名。会员中积极分子，除了带头签名外，并组织秧歌队在街头宣传。后来又与其他支会联合组成规模更大的宣传队，把流动图书车改为流动宣传车，上面布置着毛主席和斯大林大元帅画像、中苏两国国旗、“和平之鸽”及“世界和平万岁”大标语。这绚烂夺目的宣传车，配合了歌咏队、秧歌队与宣传队到市内各区进行宣传，发动市民签名，收到很大效果。
    六月二十五日，美帝国主义对朝鲜发动侵略并干涉我国解放台湾后，第八支会曾召集积极分子举行座谈会，由支会主任姚斐章（派出所所长）向他们作了一次关于中国人民反对美帝侵略台湾决心与朝鲜战事情况的报告，大家一致决定扩大宣传工作。在新生中学同学的协助下，第八支会举行了一次出动九十多人的街头宣传，发动了更多的市民签名。在这一段时期中，他们采取集体宣传推动方式，一共发动了一万二千三百零三人签名。七月二十二日，中苏友协第二区总支会为了奖励他们工作的优秀成绩，特发给他们一面锦旗。
    锦旗上“继续为保卫世界和平而努力”的字句鼓舞了每一个和平斗士的情绪，大家一致要求继续扩大和平签名运动。在一次座谈会上，他们总结并检讨了过去的工作，认为不应满足于已有的成绩，同时发觉以前所采集的集体宣传推动方式有不够深入的缺点，大家决定分组进行宣传和征集签名。三十多名积极分子分成了七个小组，每组选出自己的小组长。第二天就分别出动，并且纷纷提出竞赛挑战，保证完成任务。
    这三十多位和平斗士中，有商店店员、煤铺掌柜、短工、家庭妇女，他们对保卫世界和平都有极高的热诚。许多人暂时放下了自己的工作，或者把工作移到夜里来做，以白天的全部时间从事和平签名运动。有时冒着炎暑，有时冒着大雨，往往一天工作到十二三小时。高玉泉、张杨氏两位五十多岁的老大娘，就是他们当中模范的和平战士。
    和平斗士们在宣传方式上个别发挥了创造性。有的在胸前挂着“和平之鸽”和“保卫世界和平”的标语，有的并用硬纸制作一些如“美帝为自己安排坟墓”之类的立体漫画，吸引市民的注意，再向他们进行宣传。有些小组，深入到贫民区，耐心地给群众讲解和平签名的意义。每天晚上，大家聚在一起，报告当天情况，交流经验，并提出在工作中所遇到的困难，在姚斐章同志领导下展开讨论，作出总结，作为大家第二天进行工作的参考。这样进行了一周的工作，一共发动了二万六千二百三十七人在和平宣言上签名。邓世则、李川延等六个人的一个小组发动了一万多人，高玉泉、张杨氏两位老大娘发动了八千多人，都是优越的成绩。
    最近这一些有经验的和平斗士在第八支会的领导下，为了响应中国拥护世界和平大会争取全国一万万五千万至两万万人签名的号召，决定再继续大力开展和平签名运动。本月二十二日，他们举行了一个座谈会，听取了第二区总支会的指示，把和平签名运动与反对美帝侵略运动结合起来。不但要争取更多人在和平宣言上签名，而且要争取更多人认识保卫世界和平与反对侵略运动的意义。他们决定采取个别深入的宣传方式，继续为保卫世界和平而努力！
