Implement the Rectification Spirit to Prepare for Land Reform
　　Zhejiang Province Convenes the Third Party Representative Conference
    Exposing the bureaucratic and commandist errors in rent reduction, grain requisition, and production for disaster relief work over the past year, analyzing the ideological roots, and proposing corrective measures.
    [This newspaper] The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the Third Provincial Party Representative Conference at the end of July. The conference reviewed the work in Zhejiang Province since liberation. It first affirmed that the work over the past year has achieved significant results. It has orderly completed the takeover of cities and transitioned in a timely manner to strengthening rural work, suppressed bandits and special agents in most areas of the province, basically established the revolutionary order in the province, established people's governments at all levels, and initially mobilized and organized nearly four million peasants, which has greatly changed the face of the Zhejiang countryside. It has basically completed last year's collection of agricultural taxes and various tax tasks, ensuring the unity of financial economy, balanced revenue and expenditure, and stable prices. On the basis of initial mass mobilization, it continued to mobilize the masses in depth, focusing on the production movement. Since this spring, it has led large-scale water control and pest control movements, achieving remarkable results and creating favorable conditions for this year's increased production. In the production movement, the Party and people of all classes have gained close ties. However, there have also been many deviations and errors in the work of the past year. These deviations and errors are, of course, due to the increasingly complex and heavy working environment and tasks, the shortage of veteran cadres and the abundance of new cadres, and the lack of familiarity and experience with the situation in the new areas. However, the most important reason is still the bureaucratic and commandist erroneous ideology and work style of leading organs and party member cadres at all levels, who are divorced from reality and the masses.
    Failure to proceed from specific circumstances leads to serious alienation from the masses
    First, in the past fifteen months, the transition from taking over cities to strengthening rural work has established six major tasks for rural work: eliminating bandits and special agents, launching the struggle against local bullies, implementing rent reduction, implementing rational burden, ensuring that the level of rural production does not decline, and establishing various grassroots organizations in rural areas through the above work. On many specific issues in determining these tasks, especially in the process of implementing these tasks, it was not possible to carefully estimate the new characteristics of the national situation; nor was it possible to carefully analyze the many characteristics of the Zhejiang region and the characteristics of its own strength. Therefore, it failed to accurately implement the basic guidelines and policies of the Central Committee and the East China Bureau on the work in the newly liberated areas, and deviations occurred. As pointed out at the Second Party Representative Conference, when mobilizing the peasants to reduce taxes and increase grain last year, there was a lack of thorough and in-depth research and analysis of the characteristics of tenancy relations and exploitation relations in various parts of Zhejiang, the stability of the environment, the degree of people's awareness, and the number and quality of cadres; the reasons for not mentioning the refund of deposits and the adjustment of tenancy rights in the East China Region's rent reduction regulations were not thoroughly studied and discussed, but the experience of mobilizing the masses for rent reduction in the past was blindly copied, and clauses such as the refund of deposits and the adjustment of tenancy rights in the past rent reduction decrees were plagiarized. In the implementation, some areas added interest to the refund of deposits and advance rent, and settled old accounts; at the same time, they failed to strictly distinguish small landlords from the landlord class in terms of policy and give appropriate consideration. The adjustment of tenancy rights infringed on the interests of middle peasants and confused the steps of work and the class ranks. Landlords were not distinguished according to different circumstances, and general landlords were excessively attacked. When collecting agricultural taxes, the output situation and objective environment and subjective strength of various places were not correctly estimated, so the determined overall task was too heavy, and the standards for burdening various classes were not strictly stipulated in advance as a basis for grasping policies, and various places arbitrarily added assessments when distributing tasks, resulting in serious unevenness. After the grain requisition task was set, propaganda and education were not widely carried out, and people's representatives conferences and peasant representatives conferences were not widely held to discuss and handle affairs democratically with the masses. Some cadres proceeded from a purely task-oriented point of view and produced serious compulsory orders, indiscriminate arrests, beatings, and fines, as well as violations of policies such as searching warehouses and blockading grain exports. This seriously alienated the masses and caused dissatisfaction among the people in some areas.
    Second, the Second Party Representative Conference reviewed the above shortcomings and errors and determined that the whole party should focus on production for disaster relief and continue to implement the mobilization of the masses. This is correct. However, there was still a lack of deep and sufficient understanding of the serious alienation from the masses at that time. In the work of production for disaster relief, some areas failed to implement and execute according to the different situations in each area and the urgent demands of the masses, and adopt different work guidelines and steps. For example, in some areas, the situation of bandits was very serious, and cadres and peasant activists were repeatedly killed. The lives and property of the people were not guaranteed. The leaders did not organize forces to lead the masses to carry out armed struggles against special agents and bandits, but shouted empty slogans of production for disaster relief, which was divorced from the broad masses. In other areas, the extent of the disaster was not investigated and understood. The disaster situation was unilaterally exaggerated based on subjective imagination, ignoring the urgent demands of the majority of the masses for water control and pest control, and emphasizing disaster relief or free lending, which resulted in being divorced from the majority of the masses. The difficulties of a small number of people affected by the disaster were also not well resolved. When building water conservancy projects, many areas did not start from the vital interests of the masses, educate and enlighten the masses to act consciously, but forcibly ordered the distribution of labor or emphasized using work as relief to turn water control into relief for the spring famine. Therefore, the enthusiasm of the masses was not high, and many water conservancy projects did not meet the standards, resulting in much waste. In a few places, the masses were forced to build water conservancy projects without prior investigation and research to make overall plans and resolve water conservancy disputes among the masses, resulting in armed fights. When controlling pests, cadres did not educate and persuade the masses to break with superstitious ideas, but only emphasized exchanging twenty egg masses for one catty of rice, forcing landlords to catch insects and stipulating the number of egg masses that should be turned in every day, resulting in phenomena such as catching moth eggs for rice, selling egg masses for speculation, and buying egg masses to turn in tasks. The above reasons have resulted in the production movement since the spring only being thoroughly implemented in a small number of areas, while most areas have not done it well.
    Organ work is divorced from reality, and paperwork is seriously biased
    Third, the work of various agencies and departments cannot well study the basic situation of the cadres and work below, and cannot implement the work of various departments around the central tasks of the Party; but instead, according to their own subjective requirements or the work assigned by higher authorities, they stipulate tasks. They even blindly issue orders, instructions, forms, and documents, regardless of the importance and urgency, and push them down even if they cannot be realized at the moment. For example, the reorganization and financial unity lacked clear regulations from the leadership, causing temporary confusion, which resulted in the cadres below being overwhelmed and confusing the center of work. For example, the various agencies in Lin'an Special Zone issued 117 kinds of forms to the lower levels in one month, of which 84 were forwarded by provincial agencies and departments, and a township received as many as 95 kinds. Therefore, the cadres below reflected: "The provincial government issues orders, the special commissioner's office supplements, the county holds a conference, the district cadres run their legs off, the township cadres sleep soundly, and the village cadres mess around." It also said: "The top is multi-headed, the middle is headless, and the bottom is dizzy." This is indeed a profound portrayal of bureaucracy. Some agencies have committed serious red tape. For example, some official documents received by the provincial government have to go through ten to twenty-five or even forty complicated procedures, and some official documents travel for a month or even three months without solving the problem. One department even issued forty official documents and instructions in one day. Precious time is buried in piles of documents. These bad styles have seriously alienated the Party and the People's Government from the masses, hindering the improvement and development of work.
    Pride, complacency, and impetuosity are the source of all erroneous thinking
    When examining the ideological roots of these erroneous styles, it was unanimously believed that the main reason was that they did not clearly recognize that although basic victory had been achieved nationwide, there were many difficulties ahead: we had few backbones, did not speak the language, were not familiar with the situation, and had not established good relations with the masses. Therefore, we should estimate the objective situation, subjective conditions, and steadily explore and advance very cautiously, carefully, meticulously, and calmly; however, in the course of work, we were rough, impetuous, and estimated the situation and conditions with great pride and complacency. This is the main deviation in our leading ideology during this period. Therefore, many comrades have the ideological tendency of not learning humbly, simply copying many unsuitable struggle methods and work experiences, blindly underestimating the enemy, regarding themselves as meritorious officials, and regarding themselves as victors, being satisfied with the old ways, and not seeing the arduousness and prospects of the new China's construction tasks. Moreover, they are not good at cooperating with non-party members and do not know how to unite and strive for all social forces that can be united and strived for, divide and isolate the enemy, in order to concentrate forces to attack and eliminate the main enemy at present. The above ideas are the source of bureaucracy and commandism.
    The delegates to the conference unanimously agreed that: to overcome and transform this bad ideological style, in the future, we must earnestly strengthen the study of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee and the East China Bureau's instructions, and use this as a weapon to carry out a party-wide rectification movement from top to bottom, taking the measures of checking and summarizing work and launching criticism and self-criticism. Carrying the rectification movement forward, calling on the whole party to boldly and bravely expose the errors of bureaucracy and commandism that are divorced from reality and the masses, find out the causes of the errors, study ways to overcome the errors, and sincerely and frankly review the shortcomings and errors to the broad masses of the people. Only in this way can we improve and strengthen the relationship between the Party and the people, consolidate the people's democratic united front, overcome current difficulties; and ensure the step-by-step and orderly completion of the land reform task in the province, and strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation.
    The conference adopted the decision to carry out and complete land reform this winter in areas with the necessary conditions (about 2,600 townships, accounting for about 50% of the number of townships in the province, including 11.1 million people, accounting for 65% of the rural population of the province). Before land reform, actively carry out cadre training, reorganize rural peasant association organizations, and continue to mobilize the masses in depth to prepare for land reform. Areas that do not have the conditions for land reform this year should implement rectification to improve cadres, strictly grasp policies, and fully mobilize the masses through work such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rents, and production, and prepare the conditions for land reform next year, so as to strive to basically complete the glorious and great historical task of land reform in the province in the next two years.

　　贯彻整风精神准备土地改革
    浙省召开三次党代表会议
    揭发一年来减租征粮生产度荒工作中的官僚主义命令主义错误，分析思想根源，提出纠正办法。
    【本报讯】中共浙江省委于七月底召开全省第三次党代表会议。会上检查了浙江省解放以来的工作。首先肯定一年来的工作是有重大成绩的，有秩序地完成了城市接管工作并适时转入加强农村工作，肃清了全省大部地区的股匪，基本上确立了全省的革命秩序，建立了各级人民政府，初步发动和组织了近四百万农民群众，使浙江农村面貌有了很大改变；基本上完成了去年征收农业税及各税收任务，保证了财政经济的统一、收支平衡和物价稳定。并在群众初步发动的基础上，以生产运动为中心，继续深入发动群众。今春以来领导大规模治水、治虫运动，获得显著成绩，给今年增产创造了有利条件。在生产运动中，党和各阶层人民，获得了亲密的联系。但在这一年多工作中也出了不少的偏差和错误。这些偏差和错误，固然是由于工作环境与工作任务日益复杂而繁重，老干部少新干部多，且对新区情况不熟缺乏经验所造成的。但最主要的原因还在于各级党委的领导机关和党员干部的脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义和命令主义的错误思想作风。
    工作不从具体情况出发造成严重脱离群众现象
    第一、过去十五个月中，由接管城市转入加强农村工作，确立了农村工作的六大任务——肃清匪特、开展反霸斗争、实行减租、贯彻合理负担、保证农村生产水平不致降低、通过上述工作建立农村各种基层组织。在确立这些任务的许多具体问题上，尤其在执行这些任务的过程中，就没有能够很谨慎的估计着全国形势新的特点；也没有能够很细心的分析浙江地区许多特点，及本身力量的特点。因此，就未能十分准确的执行中央及华东局关于新解放区工作的基本方针与政策，而发生了偏差。正如二次党代表会上所指出的，在去年减税增粮发动农民群众时，事先对浙江各地的租佃关系、剥削关系的特点、环境安定情况和人民觉悟程度、干部数量和质量等问题缺乏周密深刻的研究和分析；对华东区减租条例不提退押金、调剂佃权的原因未作深入研究和讨论，而盲目地搬用过去减租发动群众的经验，抄袭过去减租法令中退押金、调剂佃权等条文；在执行中有些地区在退押金、退预租时利上加利，清算老账；同时又未能严格的在政策上将小土地出租者与地主阶级加以区别，而给予适当照顾。调剂佃权中侵犯了中农的利益，混乱了工作步骤和阶级阵营。对地主未能分别不同情况，过重地打击了一般地主。征收农业税时，未正确估计各地的产量情况及客观环境与主观力量，因而确定的总任务是过重的，预先未能严格规定各阶层负担标准以作为掌握政策根据，在分配任务时各地擅自加派，发生严重的畸轻畸重现象。征粮任务规定后又未普遍进行宣传教育，广泛召开各界人民代表会和农民代表会与群众民主商讨办事，若干干部从单纯任务观点出发，产生了严重的强迫命令，乱捕、乱打、乱罚以及搜仓、封锁粮食出口等违反政策偏向。这就严重地脱离了群众、引起若干地区人民的不满。
    第二、第二次党代表会议检讨了上述缺点和错误，确定了全党以生产度荒为中心，继续贯彻发动群众。这是正确的。但对当时严重脱离群众的情况，尚缺乏深刻足够的认识。在生产度荒工作中，有些地区又未能根据各个地区不同情况和群众迫切要求出发，采取不同工作方针和步骤去贯彻执行。如某些地区，匪情十分严重，干部和农民积极分子迭遭杀害，人民生命财产没有保障，领导者不去组织力量领导群众进行反特务匪徒的武装斗争，而空喊生产救灾，脱离了广大群众。又如某些地区不去调查了解灾荒情况的程度，凭主观想像片面夸大灾情，忽视大多数群众治水治虫的迫切要求，而去强调救灾或是自由借贷，结果脱离了大多数群众。少数人的荒灾困难也未能很好解决。兴修水利时不少地区不从群众切身利益出发，教育启发群众自觉，而强迫命令摊派人工或是强调以工代赈把治水变为救济春荒，因此群众积极性不高，许多水利工程不合标准，造成许多浪费。少数地方强迫群众修水利工程，事先不调查研究做出通盘计划，解决群众水利纠纷，而致造成械斗。治虫时干部不去教育说服群众打破迷信思想，只强调二十块卵块换一斤米，强迫地主捉虫，规定每天应交卵块数目，以致发生捉蛾卵换米、贩卖卵块投机，购买卵块交任务等现象。上述原因，造成了春季以来生产运动仅只在小部分地区得到深入贯彻，而大部分地区则没有作得很好。
    机关工作脱离实际  文牍主义偏向严重
    第三、各机关部门的工作，不能很好研究下面干部及工作的基本情况，不能围绕党的中心任务去贯彻各部门的工作；而是根据自己主观的要求，或上级交下的工作去规定任务。甚至盲目乱发命令、指示、表格和文件，不分轻重缓急，连一时不能实现的也一并向下推。如整编与财政统一，领导上缺乏明确的规定而造成一时的混乱，结果使下面干部穷于应付，混乱了工作中心。如临安专区各机关一个月向下级发出各种表格有一百十七种，其中有八十四种是转发省级机关部门的，一个乡共接到九十五种之多，因此下面干部反映：“省府下命令，专署来补充，县里开大会，区干跑断腿，乡干睡大觉，村干胡‘捣鬼’。”又说：“上面多头多脑，中间无头无脑，下面昏头昏脑。”这确是对于官僚主义的一个深刻的刻划。有的机关犯有严重的文牍主义，例如省府收到的公文，有的要经过十道至二十五道甚至四十道繁复手续，有的公文旅行一个月甚至三个月时间不能解决问题。有一个部门曾经甚至一天中发出四十道的公文指示。把可贵的时间都埋到公文堆里去了。这些恶劣的作风已经严重的使党和人民政府脱离群众，阻碍了工作的提高和发展。
    骄傲自满和粗糙急躁是一切错误思想根源
    在检查这些错误作风的思想根源时，一致认为主要是没有清楚认识虽然在全国范围内取得了基本胜利，但摆在面前的困难是很多的：我们骨干少，语言不通，情况不熟，与群众尚未建立很好的联系等，因此我们应该很谨慎的、小心的、细致的、冷静的来估计客观的情况，主观的条件，稳步的摸索前进；但是，在工作进行中，却是粗糙的，急躁的带着很大的骄傲自满情绪去估计情况与条件。这就是这一时期中我们领导思想中的主要偏差。因此在不少同志中产生不虚心学习，单纯搬用不适用的许多斗争方式和工作经验，盲目轻敌、功臣自居、胜利者自居的思想倾向，满足于旧的一套，看不到新中国建设任务的繁重和前途。并且不善于与党外人士合作，不懂得去团结和争取一切可以团结争取的社会力量，分化与孤立敌人，以便集中力量打击和消灭当前主要敌人。上述思想乃是官僚主义命令主义的根源。
    大会代表一致认为：克服与转变这种恶劣的思想作风，今后必须认真加强学习毛主席、党中央及华东局的指示，并以此为武器，采取检查和总结工作，展开批评与自我批评，坚决的自上而下的贯彻全党的整风运动。把整风运动贯彻下去，号召全党大胆勇敢地揭发脱离实际、脱离群众的官僚主义、命令主义的错误，找出犯错误的原因，研究克服错误的办法，并向广大人民群众诚恳地坦白地检讨缺点和错误。这样才能改善与加强党与人民群众的联系，巩固人民民主统一战线，克服当前困难；才能保证有步骤、有秩序地完成全省土地改革任务，为争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转而斗争。
    大会通过了今冬在具备条件地区（约为两千六百个乡，占全省乡数百分之五十左右，包括一千一百万人口，占全省农村人口的百分之六十五的地区）进行并完成土地改革。土地改革前，积极进行整训干部，整理乡村农会组织，继续深入发动群众等准备工作。今年尚不具备条件进行土地改革地区，则应贯彻整风提高干部，严格掌握政策，通过剿匪、反霸、减租、生产等工作，充分发动群众，准备好明年进行土地改革的条件，以便争取今明两年基本上完成全省土地改革的光荣伟大的历史任务。
