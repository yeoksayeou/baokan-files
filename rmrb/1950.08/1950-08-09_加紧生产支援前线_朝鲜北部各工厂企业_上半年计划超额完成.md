Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th: Factories and enterprises in the northern part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have successfully completed the production plans for the first half of the second year (1950) of the Two-Year People's Economic Plan. Many factories have exceeded their original plans, with the most notable achievements being: the machinery manufacturing plants led by managers Chen Changfu and Jin Chunmo in the mechanical industry sector, completing their plans by 129% and 118% respectively; the factories led by managers Li Quanhao and Cai Can in the chemical industry sector, completing their plans by 171% and 106% respectively; the chemical factory led by manager Wen Xueyu in the light industry sector, exceeding the plan by two and a half times; and the coal mine led by manager Cao Zongwan, exceeding the plan by 16%. In addition, the power plant led by Jin Yuanbin and the shipyard led by Cao Mingxiao both completed their production quotas by more than 110%.

Currently, workers in factories, mines, and railways are intensifying production with even greater patriotic enthusiasm to support the front lines, and are reorganizing production organizations into wartime organizations. This high degree of patriotic production enthusiasm among Korean workers is the source of the Korean people's strength to defeat American imperialism. Workers at the steel plant led by manager Jin Zaizhu have reorganized the four-group, three-shift system into a two-shift system, automatically extending working hours, further improving production. The entire plant has exceeded its quota by 130%. In particular, the work team of Ren Zhonghuan has exceeded its quota by 206% to 267%. Workers at the plant's concentrator saved one-third of the mechanical oil compared to the past. Workers in Furnace No. 5 extracted one shift of personnel from the past four groups and three shifts, but still exceeded the quota before the Patriotic War every day.

　　加紧生产支援前线
    朝鲜北部各工厂企业
    上半年计划超额完成
    【新华社平壤八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北部各工厂、企业，已胜利完成了两年人民经济计划的第二年度（一九五○年）上半年的生产计划。许多工厂都超额完成了原定计划，其中成绩最显著的有：机械工业部门陈昌富与金淳模两经理领导的机械制作所，以百分之一二九与百分之一一八完成了自己的计划；化学部门李泉浩与蔡灿两经理领导的工厂，以百分之一七一与百分之一○六完成了自己的计划；轻工业部门文学郁经理领导的化学工厂，超过计划两倍半；曹宗万经理领导的煤矿，超过计划百分之十六。此外，金元滨领导的发电所与曹明校领导的造船所，均以百分之一一○以上完成了自己的生产定额。
    目前，各工厂、矿山、铁道的工人们为了支援前线，正以更高的爱国热忱加紧生产，并将生产组织改编为战时组织。朝鲜工人们这种高度的爱国增产热忱，正是朝鲜人民战胜美帝国主义力量的源泉。在金载洙经理领导下的炼钢厂的工人，把四组三班制改编为两班制，自动延长工作时间，使生产获得了进一步的提高。全厂已以百分之一三○，超额完成了自己的定额。特别是任钟焕的工作班，以百分之二○六至二六七，超额完成了自己的定额。该厂选矿场工人，比过去节约了三分之一的机械油。五号炉的工人，从过去四组三班的人员中，抽出了一个班的人员，但每日还照样超过完成卫国战争以前的定额。
