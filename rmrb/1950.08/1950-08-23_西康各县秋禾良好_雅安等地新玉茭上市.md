　　【This Dispatch from Ya'an】The autumn crops are growing well in various counties of Xikang Province, and new corn has been successively put on the market. The masses reflect that this year's autumn scene will be a harvest unseen in fifteen years. After the province was liberated last winter, the People's Liberation Army quickly eliminated the bandit gangs, and social order tended to stabilize, enabling production to proceed smoothly. When the Xikang Military Control Commission entered Xikang, it issued a public notice strictly prohibiting the planting of opium, guaranteeing tenant rights, and advocating land reclamation and other production policies, which expanded the cultivated area. As a result, this year's grain output has also greatly increased. In Lushan County and Caoba in Ya'an, new corn has been on the market successively since mid-July. It is estimated that this year, superior paddy fields in Lushan can yield 5 Lushi per mu (each Shi being 220 jin), equivalent to 1,100 jin; medium-grade land can yield an average of 3 Shi and 5 Dou per mu, equivalent to more than 770 jin; and even the worst land can yield 2 Shi and 5 Dou per mu, equivalent to 550 jin. Many barren lands have been reclaimed in the rural areas of Tianquan County this year, and grain output will increase.

　　Most of the land in Baoxing County is planted with corn, with an average yield of 3 Shi and 5 Dou per mu. Although there were slight insect pests and etiolation in the early summer in Yingjing County and other places, the weather was sunny and rainy in summer, and they have returned to normal growth and a bumper harvest can also be expected. It is estimated that Yingjing County can produce an average of 4 Yingshi per mu (each Shi being 250 jin), equivalent to about 1,000 jin. At present, a good harvest on the plains of the counties can be expected without any concern, but the mountain areas will be affected by the damage caused by wild animals to crops, which will affect the harvest. The masses in various places are actively protecting the autumn harvest and hunting wild animals. The masses in Baoxing County combine autumn protection with hunting to obtain meat and improve their lives. Killing a wild cattle can yield about 200 jin of meat. In addition, the masses in Tianquan, Lushan, Baoxing and other counties voluntarily form groups to combine autumn protection with collecting valuable medicinal materials such as fritillary bulbs, cordyceps, and rhinoceros horn in the mountains to increase their income.

　　西康各县秋禾良好
    雅安等地新玉茭上市
    【本报雅安讯】西康省各县秋禾生长良好，新玉茭已陆续上市，群众反映，今年的秋景将为十五年来未有的丰收。该省于去冬解放后，人民解放军迅速剿灭了股匪，社会秩序趋于安定，使生产得以顺利进行。西康军管会在入康时，即于布告严禁种植鸦片，保障佃权，提倡开荒等生产政策，使耕地面积扩大，因之今年粮食产量亦大为增加。芦山县和雅安草坝等地，新玉茭已自七月中旬先后上市。今年芦山上等稻田估计每亩可收五芦石（每石二百二十斤），合一千一百斤；中等地平均每亩可收三石五斗，合七百七十多斤；最坏的每亩亦可收二石五斗，合五百五十斤。天全县农村今年开垦了许多荒地，粮食产量将可增加。
    宝兴县大部分土地都是种的玉茭，平均每亩可收三石五斗。荥经县等地夏初时虽稍有虫害和阴苗现象，但入夏以后晴雨适时，均又恢复正常生长，亦可卜丰收。据估计，荥经县每亩平均可产四荥石（每石二百五十斤），合千斤左右。现各县平地丰收已可望无虞，惟山地因野兽糟害庄稼，对收成将有影响。各地群众正积极护秋，捕打野兽。宝兴县群众以保秋和打猎结合，取得肉食，改善了生活，打死一条野牛，即可得肉二百斤左右。此外，天全、芦山、宝兴等县群众，自愿结伙，结合保秋上山采集贝母、虫草和川牛犀等贵重药材，以增加收入。
