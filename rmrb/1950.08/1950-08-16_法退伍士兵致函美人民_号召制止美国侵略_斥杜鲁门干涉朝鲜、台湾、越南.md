Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th: The National Committee of the French Association of Soldiers Returned from Indochina, representing hundreds of thousands of its members, recently issued two open letters, one to the American people and one to President Truman.

    The open letter to the American people stated: We especially salute the American people who refuse to engage in unjust wars to protect the profits of warmongers. Those who need war not only make the Korean people suffer; they also attempt to launch a new world war, so that the sons of American and French mothers will be sent to make meaningless sacrifices to protect the interests of bankers. We know that the declaration of the 114 American soldiers captured in Korea reflects the American people's desire for a peaceful life. We believe it also reflects the feelings of other soldiers, sailors, and airmen who do not want to slaughter the Korean people, just as we reflect the opinions of French soldiers who do not want to attack our Vietnamese brothers. We believe that the American people will stop the Korean War and will prevent the United States from interfering in Vietnam and Taiwan. We guarantee that in order to strive for peace and friendship between all nations, we will strengthen our struggle in the signature collection movement.

    The open letter to President Truman condemned Truman's heinous acts of ordering armed intervention in Korea's internal affairs and aggression against Taiwan and Vietnam.

    号召制止美国侵略
    斥杜鲁门干涉朝鲜、台湾、越南
    【新华社布拉格十五日电】法国自印度支那返国士兵联合会全国委员会，代表该会数十万会员，于日前发出致美国人民及杜鲁门总统的两封公开信。
    致美国人民的公开信称：我们特向拒绝为保护战争贩子的利润而去从事非正义战争的美国人民致敬。那些需要战争的人，不仅使朝鲜人民遭受苦难；他们还企图发动新的世界战争，使美国与法国的母亲们的儿子，将为保护银行家的利益而被送去作无谓的牺牲。我们知道，在朝鲜被俘的一百十四名美国兵士的宣言，反映了美国人民要求和平生活的愿望。我们相信它也反映了不愿屠杀朝鲜人民的其他兵士、水兵和航空员们的情绪，正如我们反映了不愿攻打越南弟兄们的法国兵士的意见一样。我们相信：美国人民会制止朝鲜战争，会阻止美国干涉越南和台湾。我们保证：为了争取和平与各民族间的友谊，我们要在征集签名运动中加强斗争。
    致杜鲁门总统的公开信，斥责杜鲁门下令武装干涉朝鲜内政和侵略台湾与越南的凶恶行为。
