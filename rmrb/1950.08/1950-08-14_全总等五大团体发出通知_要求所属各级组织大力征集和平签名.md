　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the All-China Students' Federation, the China New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently issued a joint notice on the peace signature campaign. The full text is as follows:
    To all levels of trade union organizations and industrial trade unions, local youth organizations, local student unions, all levels of the Youth League committees, and local women's organizations:
    The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace has issued a notice calling on all national people's organizations to step up the peace signature work and strive to complete a peace signature plan of 150 million to 200 million people nationwide. We express our warm support for this call from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. At a time when American imperialism is carrying out armed aggression against the people of Asia, it is absolutely necessary to launch a wider peace signature campaign to further strengthen our struggle against imperialist aggression and defend world peace. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, the All-China Students' Federation, the China New Democratic Youth League, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and their subordinate organizations at all levels must currently regard this work as one of their most important tasks and carry it out vigorously. It is hoped that all subordinate organizations will formulate specific plans for carrying out the signature collection work and inform us of the progress of the signature campaign at any time.

　　全总等五大团体发出通知
    要求所属各级组织大力征集和平签名
    【新华社十三日讯】中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中国新民主主义青年团、中华全国民主妇女联合会顷发出关于和平签名运动的联合通知，全文如下：
    各级工会组织及各产业工会、各地青年组织、各地学生会、青年团各级团委、各地妇女组织：
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会已发出通知，号召全国各人民团体加紧进行和平签名工作，争取在全国完成一万万五千万至两万万人的和平签名计划。对于中国保卫世界和平大会委员会的这一号召，我们表示热烈的拥护。在目前美帝国主义正在对亚洲人民进行武装侵略的情况下，更广泛地展开和平签名运动，进一步加强我们反对帝国主义侵略和保卫世界和平的斗争，是完全必要的。中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中国新民主主义青年团、中华全国民主妇女联合会所属各级组织，目前必须把这一工作当作自己的最重要工作之一，用大力去进行它。望所属各级组织都订出自己进行征集签名工作的具体计划，并随时将签名运动的情形告知我们。
