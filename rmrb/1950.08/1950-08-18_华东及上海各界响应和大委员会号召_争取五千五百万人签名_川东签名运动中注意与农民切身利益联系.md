Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th: People from all walks of life in East China and Shanghai are enthusiastically responding to the call of the China Peace Committee to further expand the peace signature campaign.

Representatives from people's organizations in East China and Shanghai held a joint meeting on the 15th, deciding to initiate the establishment of a East China Branch of the China Peace Committee, to unify leadership of the peace movement in East China's provinces (regions) and the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, and strive to complete the glorious task of 55 million signatures on the Peace Declaration in the entire East China region before the end of September. The meeting also put forward specific measures to promote the peace signature campaign in various localities.

Shanghai's *Liberation Daily*, *Ta Kung Pao*, and *Xinwen Daily* all published editorials on the 16th, unanimously calling on all the people of East China to actively mobilize and strive to complete the task of 55 million signatures in the East China region. The *Liberation Daily* pointed out in its editorial: The number of signatures in East China has already reached 20 million, but this only accounts for 15 percent of the total population of the region; if publicity can continue to be carried out in a deeper and more extensive manner, then striving for two or three times the number of people who have already signed is entirely possible. *Ta Kung Pao* called on all readers and local correspondents in its commentary to cooperate closely and mobilize the broad masses of people to sign the Peace Declaration.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 17th: The peace signature campaign in the Eastern Sichuan Administrative Region is being widely carried out in various towns and villages. By the end of July, the number of signatures in the 35 counties and cities under the jurisdiction of the region had exceeded 4 million, accounting for about 57 percent of the current total of 7 million peace signatures in the entire Southwest region during the same period.

The organizations promoting the peace signature campaign in various parts of Eastern Sichuan have paid attention to linking the promotion of peace signatures with the immediate interests of farmers and the work of opposing local bullies and reducing rent. This is the main reason for the rapid development of the movement. Local agencies, schools, and people's organizations have jointly formed organizations to promote the peace signature campaign. Those in charge went to various townships to give speeches, publicizing the significance of defending world peace and mobilizing the people to sign. Teachers and middle school students from primary and secondary schools throughout the region widely participated in the publicity activities for the peace signature campaign. In rural areas, farmers' associations have become the leading center of the peace signature campaign, holding township and village mass meetings for publicity, and setting up signature stations in teahouses and other places where the masses gather to collect signatures. The signature campaign in the vast rural areas of Eastern Sichuan is still continuing to develop.

　　华东及上海各界响应和大委员会号召
    争取五千五百万人签名
    川东签名运动中注意与农民切身利益联系
    【新华社上海十七日电】华东区及上海市各界人民热烈响应中国保卫世界和平大会委员会关于继续扩大和平签名运动的号召。
    华东区及上海市各人民团体的代表已于十五日举行联席会议，决定发起筹备成立中国保卫世界和平大会委员会华东区分会，以便统一领导华东各省（区）及上海、南京两市的保卫世界和平运动，争取九月底以前在华东全区完成五千五百万人在和平宣言上签名的光荣任务。会议并向各地提出了推进和平签名运动的各项具体办法。
    上海解放日报、大公报、新闻日报都于十六日发表社论，一致号召全华东人民积极动员起来，为完成华东区五千五百万人签名的任务而努力。解放日报在社论中指出：华东区的签名人数已有二千万人，但仅占全区总人口百分之十五；如果能够继续深入而广泛地进行宣传，则争取两三倍于现在已经签名的人数是完全可能的。大公报在社评中号召所有读者和各地通讯员密切合作，发动广大人民群众在和平宣言上签名。
    【新华社重庆十七日电】川东行政区的保卫世界和平签名运动在各个城镇和乡村广泛展开。至七月底止，该区所辖三十五个县、市的签名人数已逾四百万人，占同期西南全区目前和平签名者总数约七百万人的百分之五十七。
    川东各地和平签名运动的组织在宣传和平签名时，都注意与农民切身利益和反恶霸、减租等工作联系起来，这是使运动迅速开展的主要原因。各地各机关、学校、人民团体等均联合组成了推动和平签名运动的组织。负责人并分赴各乡讲演，宣传保卫世界和平的意义和发动人民签名。各地中小学教师及中学学生广泛参加了和平签名的宣传活动。在农村中农民协会成为和平签名运动的领导中心，召开乡保群众大会进行宣传，并在茶馆和其他群众聚集的地方，设置了签名站，征集签名。现川东广大农村的签名运动仍在继续发展中。
