　　Central People's Government Political and Legal Affairs Committee
    Summarizes Frugality Inspection
    And Formulates Further Specific Measures for Economy
    [Reported by our newspaper] The Central People's Government Political and Legal Affairs Committee has concluded its own frugality inspection. This spring, the Political and Legal Affairs Committee conducted a frugality movement and achieved some results. This inspection was carried out on the basis of the past. In terms of streamlining, it adopted the policy of allocating cadres with a focus, simplifying the organization, reducing levels, virtually eliminating the departments under the General Office, merging departments with similar functions, generally eliminating sections below the department level, and grasping the principle that streamlining the organization should not only focus on the number of personnel, but the main key lies in improving the quality of cadres and systematically training cadres. To this end, forty-eight people were sent to participate in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing this spring, and forty-four people were drawn to schools for study, and a large number of cadres were sent to work at the lower levels twice. The work of the agency continued as usual with fewer people, and some business operations were improved. Therefore, this inspection concluded that the actual effect of streamlining should be reflected in the specific organizational strength and work efficiency.
    In terms of economy, some comrades were complacent because of the achievements in economy this spring, believing that "we are frugal enough, there is nothing to inspect." Therefore, at the beginning of this inspection, the first thing to do was to overcome this complacency, pointing out that this view would hinder the in-depth inspection of economy and would relax the current phenomenon of waste. After studying, everyone's ideological understanding was improved, so some comrades said that the waste of a piece of paper, although small, is inseparable from the interests of the people, and strengthened the sense of responsibility for protecting state property. Therefore, many problems of extravagance and waste were found in the inspection: for example, it was too much to set up two telephone switchboards, and seventy-five extensions could also be reduced; wages were issued several times in advance in the spring, resulting in a surplus of 4.5 million yuan due to price relations, which was not reported to the Ministry of Finance; when building a nursery, more than 2 million yuan was deliberately budgeted for fear that the Ministry of Finance would reduce it. The Political and Legal Affairs Committee actually had only more than 170 people, and at the beginning, 274 desks were purchased, and 186 other large and small desks, leaving a surplus of two and a half desks per person. Due to poor storage, the damage to items was also very serious: 196 chairs were dismantled in two months, and one and a half boxes of door and window glass were repaired in five months; 2,000 pounds of cabbage were frozen overnight; more than 100 fire extinguishers were exposed to the sun and rain, and some shells were rotten and bottles were destroyed; the large auditorium and warehouse were built with high exterior and low interior, and rainwater flowed backwards, causing damage to materials and affecting meetings; and some housing plans were insufficient, and were rebuilt several times. Other waste problems were also found in automobile repair and use, purchasing materials, and issuing items.
    Finally, based on the experience in the spring, some economy measures were studied and formulated: such as organizing amateur labor in agencies to save expenses, and not hiring people for anything that can be done by oneself. The guards platoon was mobilized to make 10 tons of coal briquettes using the method of benefiting both public and private interests. The public works staff demolished walls, made mops, used scrap iron to make chimneys, and transported coal. The above items alone saved more than 900 jin of millet in January. This time, it was decided to reduce 55 copies of newspapers, reduce one telephone switchboard and 50 extensions. Water and electricity have all been ordered to save measures. Coal is subject to a quota system. Office expenses are subject to a contracted amount according to the business needs of the departments and sections. An inspection system and a technical research group have been established for automobiles, and fuel consumption standards for vehicles have been stipulated. In addition to reducing 27 bicycles, three types of repair costs have been set according to the quality of the bicycles, and a contracted repair system has been adopted. Specific plans have also been made for printing the Political and Legal Affairs Gazette and saving paper. (Zhang Baishui)

　　中央人民政府政法委员会
    总结精简节约检查
    并订出了进一步节约的具体办法
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政法委员会本身的精简节约检查已进行了总结。政法委员会今春曾进行过精简节约运动，并收到一些成绩。这次检查是在过去的基础上进行的，在精简方面，采取有重点的配备干部，简化机构，减少层次，将办公厅下的处实际取消，业务相近的科加以合并，科以下一般的取消了股，并掌握了精简机构不单从人员数目字着眼，主要关键在于提高干部质量，有计划的培养干部的方针。为此目的，今春曾派出四十八人参加了京郊土改，又抽出四十四人到学校进行学习，并曾两次派出大批干部到下面去工作。机关工作在人少的情况下照常进行，并在某些业务工作上还有所改进。所以这次检查得出结论，精简的实际效果应当是表现在具体组织力量与工作效率上。
    在节约方面，有些同志因为今春的节约有成绩，表示自满，认为“我们已够节约了，没啥可检查”。所以在这次检查的开始，首先是克服这种自满情绪，指出这种看法会妨害节约检查的深入，会放松现在的浪费现象。经过学习，提高了大家的思想认识，于是有的同志说一张纸的浪费虽小，但和人民利益分不开，加强了爱护国家财产的责任心。因此在检查中发现不少铺张浪费的问题：如按设两座电话总机太多，分机七十五座也可减少；春季曾提前发工资数次，因物价关系盈余四百五十万元，未向财部实报；修建托儿所，恐财部核减，故意多造预算二百多万元。政法委员会实际只有一百七十多人，在开始时购置办公棹二百七十四张，其他大小棹子一百八十六张，每人合两张半棹子还有剩余。因保管不好，物品损坏也很严重：两个月内拆椅子一百九十六把，五个月补门窗玻璃一箱半；一夜冻坏白菜二千斤；百多部消火器，日晒雨淋，有的壳烂瓶毁；修建大礼堂与仓库外高内低，雨水倒流，造成物资损坏和影响开会；并有的房屋计划不够，重修数次。其他在汽车修理使用，采买物资，领发物品等方面都检查出一些浪费问题。
    最后根据春季的经验，研究和制订了一些节约的办法：如组织机关业余劳动，节约开支，凡是自己能做的就不请人。用公私两利的办法发动警卫排同志做了十吨煤球，工务员拆墙、做墩布、用废铁打烟筒、运煤等。以上各项只一月份就节约小米九百多斤。这次订出减缩报纸五十五份，减电话机总机一座，分机五十部。水电都订出节约办法。煤炭实行定量制。办公费按科股业务需要，实行包干领用。汽车建立了检查制度和技术研究组，规定车辆用油标准。自行车除减少二十七辆外，并按车子好坏，订出三种修理费，采取包干负责修理制。印刷政法公报，节约用纸也订出了具体计划。（张白水）
