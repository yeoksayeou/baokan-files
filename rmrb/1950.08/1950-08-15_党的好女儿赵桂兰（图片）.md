　　The Party's Good Daughter (Continued)
　　By Jiang Ping
　　(VII) On December 19th of last year, Zhao Guilan, working while ill, took a package of "fulminate of mercury" to the mixing room, but before she reached the room, she suddenly felt dizzy and the room was spinning before her eyes. Her legs weakened and she fell to the ground. She knew it was bad; the "fulminate of mercury" would explode in less than a minute upon hitting the ground.
　　(VIII) In that minute between life and death, she didn't think of herself. Her first thought was that the workshop was only twenty steps away. It was full of explosive medicines, and nearby was the warehouse. If she threw it out, the whole factory would be destroyed. To protect the property of the motherland, she couldn't throw it. She held the "fulminate of mercury" tightly in her hand. With a loud bang, Zhao Guilan was blown to pieces.
　　(IX) Zhao Guilan was sent to the hospital and underwent surgery. On the fourth day, she woke up from her coma. She cried when she discovered her left hand had been amputated. Her brother, standing beside her, was also saddened and didn't know what to say to comfort her. So he immediately went to get the Party Branch Secretary, who comforted her, saying, "The Party's work is endless. As long as your mind is still good, you can continue to work for the Party."
　　(X) The District Party Committee and the Administrative Office issued a circular commending Zhao Guilan, calling on all workers in the district to learn from her. She said with emotion, "Thank you for the Party's concern!" Zhao Guilan's heroic deeds quickly spread to all factories. The workers took Zhao Guilan as their role model, working with redoubled enthusiasm to fight for the economic construction of New China.

　　党的好女儿（续完）
　　江平作
　　（七）去年十二月十九日带病工作的赵桂兰拿着一包“雷汞”送到配置室去，但还没走到屋内突然头昏了，房子在眼前直打转；腿一软倒在地上。她知道坏啦，“雷汞”触地不上一分钟就要爆炸。
　　（八）在这生死间的一分钟，她想到的不是自己，她首先想到离她二十步远就是工作室。里面全是爆炸药品，附近又是仓库，如扔出了手就会炸坏了全厂。为保护祖国财产，不能扔，把“雷汞”紧握在手里，一声巨响赵桂兰被炸成血人了。
　　（九）赵桂兰被送到医院，施行了手术。第四天她从昏迷中清醒了。她发现左手被锯掉便哭了。哥哥在旁边也难过的不知用什么话去安慰她。于是立刻去把党支书打来，支书安慰她说：“党的工作做不完，只要脑子还好就能继续为党工作。”
　　（十）区党委、行署，通令嘉奖赵桂兰，号召全区职工向她学习。她感动地说：“谢谢党对我的关怀！”赵桂兰的英雄事迹很快地传遍各工厂。工友们把赵桂兰作为自己的学习榜样，以加倍的劳动热情来为新中国的经济建设而奋斗。
