　　US Coerces Western European Vassal States to Prepare for War
    British Laboring People Resist Government's Policy of Expanding Armaments
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th] TASS Moscow, 10th: The Red Star newspaper observer wrote: The American ruling clique launched the war of aggression against the Korean people, and now demands that their Western European vassal states drastically increase the arms race and put their entire economy into a war system. Acheson loudly declared on the podium of the US Congress that the Marshallized countries must double their war production. According to Agence France-Presse reports: Western European countries will submit their specific war preparedness plans for mobilizing materials and manpower to Truman no later than August 5th.

    The British Labour government, in the most obedient lackey posture, was the first to implement the orders of this overseas master. On August 2nd, it sent a memorandum to Washington, outlining Britain's new military plans. The Labour government will allocate a huge sum of 3.4 billion pounds for military purposes in the next three years. Therefore, the British economy will be completely dedicated to preparations for a new war.

    The British Labour government's strengthening of the arms race completely ignores the direct interests of the country. The huge increase in military spending will inevitably reduce investment in peaceful industries, further worsen the already dangerous financial situation, and once again hit the living standards of the working masses. Direct and indirect taxes will sharply rise, and the prices of consumer goods will also increase.

    The Labour rulers are well aware that, under Britain's current financial circumstances, it is impossible to implement such a huge armament plan, and it must obtain the enslaving assistance of the American imperialists. Therefore, while agreeing to reduce the living standards of the working people as much as possible and put the British economy entirely into war production, it also begged the tycoons of Wall Street to extend a helping hand once again.

    This policy of the Labour government has met with increasing resistance from the British working people. They are unwilling to die for the benefit of the Gold Dollar Emperor. The mass movement protesting the American aggression against Korea, and the 800,000 signatures on the Stockholm Appeal to ban the atomic bomb, are the British people's answer to the sinful activities of the Labour lackeys who serve Wall Street.

### 美胁迫西欧附庸国备战  英劳动人民抗拒政府扩大军备政策

　　美胁迫西欧附庸国备战
    英劳动人民抗拒政府扩大军备政策
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：红星报观察家写道：美国统治集团发动了对朝鲜人民的侵略战争，现在，又要求他们的西欧附庸国急剧地增强军备竞赛，将他们的整个经济投入战争体制。艾奇逊在美国国会的讲坛上大声宣称，马歇尔化国家必须加倍地进行战争生产。据法新社报道：西欧国家最迟不超过八月五日将把他们动员物资与人力的具体备战计划提交杜鲁门。
    英国工党政府以最忠顺的走狗姿态首先实行了这个海外主子的命令。在八月二日，它把一项备忘录送达华盛顿，叙述了英国的新军事计划。工党政府在以后三年内，将拨出三十四亿英镑的巨款作为军事用途。因此，英国的经济便将完全为新战争准备而服务。
    英国工党政府加强军备竞赛，完全忽视了国家的直接利益。军事开支的巨额增加，将不可避免地减少了对和平工业的投资，使目前已经很危险的财政情况更为恶化，并将再一次地打击劳动大众的生活水准。直接税和间接税将要尖锐地上升，消费品的价格也要上涨。
    工党统治者们很清楚地知道，在英国目前的财政情况下，它是不能实现这样巨大的军备计划的，它必须取得美帝国主义者的奴役性的援助。因此，英国一面同意尽可能降低劳动人民的生活水准，将英国的经济完全投入战争生产，一面又哀求华尔街的大亨们再一次伸出援助之手。
    工党政府的这种政策，已遭到英国劳动人民愈来愈大的抗拒。他们不愿意为金圆皇帝的利益送死。抗议美国侵略朝鲜的群众运动，禁止原子弹的斯德哥尔摩宣言上的八十万个签名，就是英国人民大众对那些为华尔街服役的工党奴才的罪恶活动的答复。
