　　Hunan Province Basically Completes Second Quarter Non-Ferrous Metal Production Task

　　[Changsha Dispatch] The well-known non-ferrous metal production of antimony, manganese, tungsten, and zinc in Hunan Province has completed and exceeded the task for the second quarter of this year, except for a shortfall of 7.2% in zinc white and 15.6% in zinc ingots. The figures are as follows: pure antimony exceeded the target by 122%, tungsten ore by 124.5%, and manganese ore by 119.5%.

　　The main reason for overfulfilling the production targets is the implementation of the principles of democratic management and enterprise operation. Major mines have improved unreasonable systems in production based on these principles. The Ruyuan Antimony Mine Engineering Office abolished the unreasonable system of overseers and implemented a piecework ore inspection system. The Xiangtan Manganese Mine changed the contract labor system to a foreman system, eliminating intermediate exploitation. The Beilian Factory of the Xinhua Xikuangshan Mining Bureau abolished the shift supervision system of staff members for smelting furnaces and unified the reporting of situations. The Shuikoushan Mining Bureau implemented excess reward for sulfur refining. The Yaogangxian Tungsten Mine Engineering Office changed the small group system to a large group system, eliminating feudal exploitation. This has achieved considerable results in improving production efficiency. For example, Pit 4 of the Ruyuan Engineering Office alone produced 250 tons of antimony ore per month, which is 3% more than the highest record during the Kuomintang period and 70% more than the original target. In terms of quality, in the past, nine tons of ore would only yield four points of oxygen; now, one ton of antimony can yield eight points of oxygen.

　　At the same time, some mining areas have begun to reform the large and bloated old institutions and rationally adjust staffing. Mines with development potential have increased personnel allocation. In terms of the wage system, all units have successively undergone democratic evaluation, and most have adopted a wage point system, paying according to labor. The Ruyuan Engineering Office has established a piecework wage system. These have directly stimulated the improvement of productivity, thus enabling the completion of the second quarter production plan.

　　However, the reform of the system is currently limited to local trials. Important systems, such as work methods, labor discipline, economic quotas, engineering plans, and business contacts, still need to be continuously improved. Only in this way can work efficiency be fully utilized and production be improved.

### 湖南省有色金属生产第二季任务基本完成

　　湖南省有色金属生产第二季任务基本完成
    【本报长沙讯】著名的湖南锑、锰、钨、锌等有色金属生产，今年第二季除锌白差百分之七·二，锌块差百分之一五·六外，已完成并超过任务。计：纯锑超额完成百分之一二二，钨砂百分之一二四·五，锰砂百分之一一九·五。
    超额完成生产任务的主要原因，是开始实行了民主管理化与经营企业化的方针，各主要矿场根据这一方针改进了生产中的不合理制度。乳源锑矿工程处，取消了不合理的监工制度，改行计件验砂制度；湘潭锰矿将包工制改为领工制，取消了中间剥削；新化锡矿山矿务局北炼厂取消职员对炼炉的值班监工制，统一汇报情况；水口山矿务局对硫磺提炼试行超额奖励；瑶岗仙钨矿工程处将小伙制改为大伙制，取消了封建剥削。这样对提高生产效率，获得了相当成果。例如乳源工程处仅四坑就月产锑砂二百五十吨，比国民党时期最高纪录多出百分之三，超过原定任务的百分之七十；在质量上，从前九吨砂只出四分氧，现在可以出一吨锑八分氧了。
    与此同时，有些矿区已开始改革庞大臃肿的旧机构，合理的调整编制。有发展性的矿山并增加了人员的配备。在工资制度方面，各单位都先后经过民主评分，大部分都采用了工薪分制，按劳取酬，乳源工程处则建立了计件工资。这些都直接的刺激了生产力的提高，因而得以完成第二季生产计划。
    但制度的改革目前还限于局部的试办。重要的制度：如工作方法、劳动纪律、经济定额、工程计划、业务联系等，尚待继续努力改进，只有这样才能充分发挥工作效能搞好生产。
