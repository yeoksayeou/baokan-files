　　Supply Cadre Chen Jingsheng and Others of a Certain Division: Lured by Private Merchants, Large Quantities of Public Property Lost
To the Editor:
　　Zhang Jixuan, the manager of the private Minfeng Flour Mill in Changli County, Hebei Province, used illegal means to lure individual cadres in the government and the army to engage in corruption, steal and sell materials, and default on large sums of money owed to the state-owned Grain Company, Oil Company, Changli County Government, and local garrison for entrusted processing, sales, and purchases. The Changli County People's Government accepted the accusations from the above units and arrested Zhang Jixuan.
　　Before the Japanese surrender, Zhang Jixuan was the manager of the Xingya Clothing Factory in Harbin. After the Japanese surrender, he was detained by the government for stealing and selling materials from Japanese warehouses taken over by the state. Last spring, he deceived the government into granting him bail and fled to Changli. He and Cheng Fengwu, Qi Yushan, and Li Rongjiu, an opium addict and kidnapper, and four others formed a partnership with 6,600 jin of millet as capital to open the Minfeng Flour Mill. On the surface, they engaged in flour milling and acted as sales and purchasing agents, but in reality, they used the agency as a cover for speculation and profiteering. In September of last year, the supply department of a certain division of the People's Liberation Army established a flour processing and purchasing relationship with the Minfeng factory. In order to facilitate speculation in the future, Zhang Jixuan and others invited Chen Jingsheng and Zhao Ruiwen, cadres of the supply section, to bathe, watch operas, and dine at restaurants. They also introduced Chen Jingsheng to a wife. The first time the factory purchased over 2,000 jin of pork and other items for the supply department, Zhang Jixuan and others were willing to lose 3,000 jin of millet in order to attract more business. Chen Jingsheng and Zhao Ruiwen were lured by Zhang Jixuan and introduced the sale of over 10,000 jin of cotton stored by the supply department to the factory. They falsely reported to their superiors that the cotton was severely damp and requested that it be sold to the Minfeng factory at a price 20% lower than the market price, stipulating that payment would be made after the cotton was sold. Later, after inspection by the leadership, it was found that Chen Jingsheng's report was false, so only 3,800 jin were approved for sale to Ji Xuan, which allowed Zhang Jixuan and others to earn over 18,000 jin of red grain. In addition, Wei Mengjun, a warehouse keeper of a certain unit, entrusted the Minfeng factory to purchase 20,000 jin of kerosene. Zhang Jixuan and others bought it with a large scale (old sixteen taels) and sold it with a small scale (new ten taels). They also changed the 64-jin oil drum skin to 46 jin, thus cleverly extracting over 1,000 jin from the 20,000 jin of oil. In order to consolidate the agency relationship with potential for huge profits, Zhang Jixuan introduced his own niece, Feng Yuchan, to Wei Mengjun, and also lured his sister-in-law, Kong Wenhua, into a physical relationship with Wei Mengjun. In order to get engaged, Zhang Jixuan instructed Feng Yuchan to demand that he support her schooling, requiring an annual living allowance of 2,800 jin of rice. To pay this amount, Wei Mengjun stole 329 jin of peanuts and 1,600 bars of soap and other materials from the warehouse. Furthermore, he went to Tianjin to get married without notifying his superiors.
　　When prices fluctuated in February of this year, Zhang Jixuan impersonated personnel from a state-owned enterprise and raised the purchase price of peanuts by 20% in the market in order to hoard them and obtain huge profits. According to incomplete statistics, the factory has illegally seized over 66 million yuan in profits in the past six months.
　　Currently, it owes the Grain Company and the county finance section 45,700 jin of grain and 6.98 million yuan in entrusted sales and purchase funds to five units, including certain units and the Oil Company.
　　In order to rectify revolutionary discipline, the People's Government has already sent Wei Mengjun and others, who have committed serious errors, to the military court for handling. This matter should attract the attention of leading organs, and economic work cadres should be regularly educated.

　　某师供给干部陈景生等
    被私商拉拢损失大批公家物资编者同志：
    河北昌黎县私营民丰制粉厂经理张继轩用非法手段拉拢政府及部队中个别干部进行贪污，盗卖物资，拖欠国营粮食公司、油脂公司、昌黎县府和当地驻军委托加工、代销代购的大批粮款。昌黎县人民政府接受以上各单位控告，将张继轩逮捕归案。
    张继轩在日寇投降前，曾在哈尔滨兴亚被服厂当经理。日寇投降后，因他盗卖国家接收日本仓库的物资，被政府扣押起来。去年春，他蒙骗政府取保逃到昌黎，和程风伍、齐玉珊，还有吸鸦片的拐骗手李荣久等七人合股以六千六百斤小米作资本，开设民丰制粉厂，表面上进行磨面生产，兼营代售代购，实质却是借代销代购进行投机倒把。去年九月，人民解放军某师供给部和民丰工厂建立了磨粉加工和代购关系。张继轩等为便于日后投机，就请供给股干部陈景生、赵瑞文洗澡、看戏、下馆子，还给陈景生介绍了一个老婆。头一次该厂为供给部代购猪肉等物两千余斤，张继轩等情愿自己赔掉三千斤小米，以便招揽更多的生意。陈景生、赵瑞文为张继轩所拉拢，就向供给部介绍把供给部存的万余斤棉花卖给该厂，并向上虚报棉花受潮严重，要求比市价贱十分之二卖给了民丰厂，规定棉花售出后再交款。后来经领导上检查，与陈景生报告相反，故只批准卖给继继轩三千八百斤，这就使张继轩等赚了一万八千余斤红粮。又某部队仓库库员魏孟浚，委托民丰厂代购两万斤煤油，张继轩等以大秤（老十六两）买进，以小秤（新十两）卖出，并将六十四斤的油桶皮，改为四十六斤，这样从两万斤油里就巧取了千余斤。张继轩为了巩固有暴利可图的代购关系，便把自己的亲外甥女冯玉婵介绍给魏孟浚，并且还引诱自己的小姨子孔文华与魏孟浚发生肉体关系。为了要订婚，张继轩指使冯玉婵要求供养她上学，每年要二千八百斤米的生活供养费。为了付出这笔钱，魏孟浚盗卖了仓库三百二十九斤花生和一千六百块肥皂等物资。并且未通知上级，即私自到天津结了婚。
    今年二月份物价波动时，张继轩冒充国营企业的人员，在市场上提价百分之二十收购花生，以便囤积，获取暴利。据不完全统计，半年来该厂利用非法手段攫取暴利六千六百余万元。
    目前拖欠粮食公司和县财政科粮食四万五千七百斤和某些部队与油脂公司等五个单位委托代销代购款六百九十八万元。
    人民政府为整饬革命纪律，刻已将犯严重错误的魏孟浚等送军法处处理。此事应引起领导机关的注意，并经常要对经济工作干部进行教育。
