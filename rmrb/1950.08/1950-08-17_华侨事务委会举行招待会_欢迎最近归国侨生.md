Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government held a reception on the 13th for overseas Chinese students who have recently returned to the country. Three hundred and sixty-nine young overseas Chinese students who have returned from various parts of Southeast Asia to study attended.

	Fei Zhendong, Director of the Cultural and Educational Propaganda Department of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and chairman of the meeting, pointed out in his speech that the number of overseas Chinese students returning to the country is increasing day by day. The enthusiastic return of overseas Chinese students shows that the Central People's Government is increasingly supported by overseas Chinese, especially young overseas Chinese students.

	Liao Chengzhi, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, first congratulated the overseas Chinese students present for safely overcoming the obstruction of imperialism and the blockade of the Kuomintang bandit ships and successfully arriving in the capital of the People's China. He said: "Why do the imperialists and the Kuomintang not want you to return to your motherland? Because they are about to die, they are afraid of overseas Chinese uniting around the New China and Chairman Mao." He pointed out that the responsibility of returned overseas Chinese students is to serve overseas Chinese and serve the cause of the people.

	Wei Que, Deputy Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, said: The Ministry of Education has decided to liberally admit returned overseas Chinese students. Our graduates will have unlimited opportunities for development in the construction of the motherland. Nie Weiqing, Vice Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation, then rose to represent students across the country and expressed a warm welcome to the returned overseas Chinese students, and encouraged them to "work hard to study revolutionary theory and scientific knowledge and cultivate themselves into useful talents for the New China." Li Tiemin, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, then encouraged the overseas Chinese students present to study diligently in the Hokkien dialect. Chen Yi Jin, an overseas Chinese student from the North China People's Revolutionary University, introduced the school's study life and ideological transformation experience at the meeting. Finally, Zhang Ruiyuan, the representative of Indonesian returnee students, delivered a reply, saying: "We must learn our skills well and strive for the construction of the motherland and the cause of human peace." The reception concluded with a performance of various Nanyang entertainment programs.
