　　Untimely Grain Transportation
    Causes Losses in Manpower and Materials
    Reply from China National Grain Corporation

To the Editors:

　　In the "People's Forum" on July 26th, Comrade Du Huaiqing of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Liaocheng District, Pingyuan Province, criticized the Grain Corporation for "untimely grain transportation, causing losses in manpower and materials." We immediately sent people to investigate. Now we will inform you of the facts, the handling results, and our self-criticism.

    The first batch of 800,000 jin of red sorghum was loaded onto trains in Tianjin starting on May 15th, and was expected to arrive in Yucheng from the 16th to the 22nd. The Pingyuan Provincial Grain Corporation informed the Liaocheng Grain Corporation of this matter by telephone. Due to poor phone clarity, the Liaocheng Grain Corporation believed that all the grain would arrive on the 16th, without considering whether long-distance transportation could arrive on time or be fully delivered. After receiving the notice from the Liaocheng Grain Corporation that the grain would arrive in Yucheng on the 16th, the Liaocheng District Supply and Marketing Cooperative mobilized vehicles to Yucheng Station to receive the grain before the 16th. However, as a result, the grain was one day late, causing huge losses in manpower and materials. This loss was due to the Liaocheng Grain Corporation's lack of carefulness in its work. In addition to the company being responsible for compensating the losses caused by the vehicle delays, the company's manager, Mr. Gu, has also made a self-criticism.

    The second batch of 3 million jin of coarse grains and 2 million jin of soybean cakes was originally scheduled to be shipped in June. But in reality, only 13 percent of the soybean cakes were completed, and the soybeans had not yet arrived. According to the inspection report of the Northeast Grain Corporation: due to the export of coarse grains from the Northeast and the successive arrival of overseas ships at the port, the Northeast Grain Corporation, in order to maintain international trade credit, rushed to transport export coarse grains, and therefore failed to take into account the coarse grains transported to the interior, resulting in the failure to complete the plan as scheduled. However, the Northeast Grain Corporation did not formally notify the grain receiving areas of this situation, thereby causing unnecessary losses to the grain receiving areas. The Northeast Grain Corporation has now made a self-criticism and will pay attention to correcting this error in future work.

    We believe that although there are objective reasons for the occurrence of this incident; however, the main reason is that our work lacks planning and a sense of responsibility. Therefore, we should be responsible for the political and economic losses caused by this incident. We sincerely accept Comrade Du Huaiqing's criticism and the lessons of this incident, and we will strengthen planning, inspection, and supervision in future grain transportation work so that this kind of error will not be repeated, so as to avoid losses to the masses. We agree with the Pingyuan Provincial Finance Committee's opinion that a good explanation should be given to the masses, and we hope that the Pingyuan Provincial Cooperative Federation and the Pingyuan Provincial Grain Corporation can provide more explanations to the masses.

### 运输粮食不守时间  造成人力物力损失事件  中国粮食公司来信答复

　　运输粮食不守时间
    造成人力物力损失事件
    中国粮食公司来信答复编者同志：
    七月二十六日“人民园地”刊登了平原省聊城专区供销合作社杜淮青同志对粮食公司“运输粮食不守时间，造成人力物力损失”一事的批评。我们当即派人检查，现在把事实经过，处理结果和我们的检讨告诉你们。
    第一批红粮八十万斤，系在五月十五日起在天津装车，预计十六日至二十二日可运到禹城。平原省粮食公司用电话把这件事告诉聊城粮食公司，因电话不清晰，聊城粮食公司就认为十六日可全部运到，而没有考虑到长途运输是否能够如期到达或全部运到。聊城专区供销合作社接到聊城粮食公司关于粮食在十六日到达禹城的通知后，就在十六日前调集车辆到禹城车站接运。但结果，粮食迟到一天，造成了人力物力的巨大损失。这个损失是由于聊城粮食公司对工作不够细心。现在除了因车辆延误而造成的损失由该公司负责赔偿外，该公司谷经理并已作了检讨。
    第二批粗粮三百万斤、豆饼二百万斤，原订计划在六月份运完。但实际上豆饼只完成百分之十三，大豆则尚未运到。据东北粮食公司检查报告：由于东北粗粮出口，海外船只陆续抵达口岸，东北粮食公司为了维护国际贸易信用，赶运出口粗粮，因而对运往关内粗粮未能兼顾，以致计划不能如期完成。但是东北粮食公司却没有将这一情况正式通知收粮地区，因而造成收粮地区不必要的损失。现在东北粮食公司已作了检讨，并在今后工作上注意改正这个错误。
    我们认为：这次事件的发生，虽然有其客观原因；但是，主要的原因是我们工作中计划性和责任心不够。因此，我们对于这一事件所造成的政治上、经济上的损失，是应该负责的。我们诚恳接受杜淮青同志的批评和这一事件的教训，在今后粮食运输工作中加强计划性和检查、督促工作，使这种错误不再重犯，以避免群众遭受损失。我们同意平原省财委会提出的应向群众进行很好解释的意见，希望平原省合作总社及平原省粮食公司能够对群众多多进行解释。
