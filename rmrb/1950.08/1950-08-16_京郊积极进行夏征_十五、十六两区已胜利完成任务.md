　　Active Summer Grain Collection in the Suburbs of Beijing
    Fifteenth and Sixteenth Districts Successfully Complete Tasks
    [Our Newspaper] The summer grain collection work in the suburban districts of Beijing is progressing actively. Among them, the Fifteenth District (Shijingshan) and the Sixteenth District (Mentougou) have successfully completed their tasks. As of August 8th, the districts have completed a total of over 2.66 million jin, accounting for approximately 70% of this year's summer grain collection task.
    During this collection, each district held meetings of district and village cadres to convey the summer grain collection policy. They also specifically discussed the policy and assessed tax reduction numbers through farmers' representative meetings or evaluation committees elected by farmers, generally ensuring fairness and reasonableness and preventing biases such as excessively light or heavy burdens, or coercive orders. However, due to varying degrees of poor harvests and floods in each district, as well as the quality of preparatory work, some districts progressed smoothly while others experienced difficulties.
    In Shijingshan District, the wheat blight was relatively minor this year, and the masses had already made preparations for the collection work. More importantly, after the district announced the reduction and exemption tasks, each village carried out political mobilization, explaining the government's reasonable burden policy of reducing burdens and collecting taxes in one allocation over two seasons. During the summer grain collection, each village generally implemented tax reductions, ensuring that particularly difficult households were taken care of, thus gaining unanimous support from the masses. In particular, the emancipated peasants who had been allocated wheat fields were in high spirits, taking the lead in handing over public grain, considering handing over public grain as "the first time this year" and feeling very honored. Furthermore, when villages carried out political mobilization through farmers' associations, women's associations, and Party and Youth League branches, they combined it with propaganda against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea, calling for "handing over public grain to fight Taiwan," creating a surge in grain delivery. Liuniangfu Village completed its task entirely within four hours after the collection began, and the entire district overfulfilled its task within three days. However, during the collection, a few district cadres simply emphasized difficulties, failed to explain and mobilize among the masses, and actively overcome difficulties. Some cadres, due to the rectification campaign being imminent, were afraid of making mistakes and were hesitant, failing to effectively urge the handover of public grain, causing the masses to delay and wait and see, delaying the delivery. These biases urgently need to be overcome.

### 京郊积极进行夏征  十五、十六两区已胜利完成任务

　　京郊积极进行夏征
    十五、十六两区已胜利完成任务
    【本报讯】京郊各区夏征工作正积极进行，其中十五区（石景山）、十六区（门头沟）已胜利完成任务。截至八月八日止，各区共约完成二百六十六万余斤，约占今年夏征任务百分之七十左右。
    这次征收，各区都召开了区、村干部会议，传达夏征政策，并通过农民代表会或农民选出的评议委员会，具体讨论政策，评议减征数，一般地作到公平合理，注意防止了畸轻畸重，强迫命令等偏向。但由于各区歉收和水患各有轻重，以及准备工作的好坏，有的进行顺利，有的感觉困难。
    石景山区由于今年麦子病害较轻，群众对征收工作已早作准备。更主要的，由于该区公布了减免任务后，各村都进行了政治动员，说明了政府减轻负担和一次分配、两季征收的合理负担政策。夏征中各村普遍实行减征，使特别困难的户都得到照顾，因而得到了群众的一致拥护。尤其是分得麦田的翻身农民，情绪很高，带头交粮，认为交公粮“今年是头一卯”，十分光荣。又各村在通过农会、妇女会、党、团支部进行政治动员时，结合了宣传反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜，号召“交公粮，打台湾”，造成了交粮热潮。刘娘府村在开征后四个钟头内全部完成任务，全区三天内超额完成任务。但，在征收中，有少数区干部单纯强调困难，未能在群众中进行解释、动员和主动地克服困难；有的干部因整风在即，怕犯错误，束手束脚，对公粮督促不力，致使群众拖延观望，迟迟不交。这些偏向，都是亟待克服的。
