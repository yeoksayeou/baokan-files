    Labor-Capital Cooperation Improves Management
    Overcomes Severe Difficulties, and Approaches Balanced Revenue and Expenditure
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch] The Nanjing Private Yongli Ammonia Plant has improved its management, turning production from severe difficulties onto a normal path. This plant is the largest chemical fertilizer plant in the country, previously producing over 3,000 tons of fertilizer powder per month. However, due to poor management, it encountered serious difficulties after the cessation of inflation this spring. To overcome these difficulties, labor and capital, through numerous consultations, made the following improvements in management:

    Organizational Structure Changed According to Production and Business Needs
    Firstly, the organizational structure was changed according to production and business needs. In the past, this plant, along with two other alkali plants, had eleven offices including Hankou and Guangzhou, in addition to the general management office. According to the March statistics, the number of personnel in the administrative departments accounted for as much as one-third of the total number of employees in the plant. For example, there were eight staff members solely responsible for distributing wages, rice, and grain, and more than fifty cooks in the snack kitchen. Now, the plant has begun to partially adjust the production organization that does not meet the requirements of production, and added necessary organizations. For example, in order to promote sales to rural areas on a large scale, the plant has established 120 experimental stations in Liuhe County alone, guiding farmers in the use of fertilizer powder. In this way, the company can gradually solve the sales problem on its own, instead of solely relying on state-owned enterprises for acquisition. At the same time, the company transferred young and strong workers from the administrative departments to the technical departments for learning, mobilized forty-two security guards who did not participate in production in the past to return to their hometowns for production, and appropriately adjusted the work of incompetent staff members.

    Started Seriously Establishing a Cost Accounting System
    Secondly, a cost accounting system was established. In the past, the plant's production and construction were unplanned. During the period of extreme financial difficulty after liberation, the plant spent a lot of money to build houses that were not urgently needed. The plant did not calculate costs in the construction projects. For example, it cost more than 3,000 piculs of rice to repair a boat, which could almost buy a steamship. In the past, the plant only calculated market profits and not production costs, so there was a lot of waste in the procurement and use of raw materials, and the phenomenon of corruption and self-interest was quite serious. After improving production management, the plant's capital side has begun to formulate monthly production plans since May, and has established systems for procurement, storage, receipt, acceptance, raw material consumption, and finished product statistics reports. Since June, a budget system has been implemented, and the revenue and expenditure situation is published every ten days. The plant has also cleared up materials and achieved unified allocation of materials throughout the plant, eliminating the phenomenon of capital backlog and waste.

    Workers Voluntarily Reduced Wages and Benefits
    Thirdly, the workers voluntarily reduced their wages and benefits appropriately, and increased their enthusiasm for labor. In the past, the salaries of the plant's employees were relatively high. The highest salary of management staff reached 548 practical units, and the general salary was close to 400 units. The salaries of service personnel were generally close to 150 units. Employee benefits were also quite high. For example, the snack allowance was 40 to 50 units per person per month. After labor-capital consultation, employee salaries were generally reduced by one-quarter. The plant's trade union also launched production committees in various workshops to promote active production among workers. Now, the phenomenon of workers arriving late and leaving early has been eliminated in the workshops where production committees have been established.

    After the above improvements, the plant's production costs have been greatly reduced. For example, in April, the cost was reduced by about 20% just by practicing economy and reducing wages. In addition, the current season is the peak sales season for fertilizer powder, and demand exceeds supply, so the plant's revenue and expenditure are close to balanced.

    The various initial improvements in the plant's management are the result of labor-capital consultation. In view of the plant's excessive debt, which led to serious difficulties in production, the labor and capital sides held a production symposium in late March. However, because the capital side unilaterally emphasized that the workers' labor discipline was not good and wages were too high, and had the idea of completely relying on the government to solve the difficulties, coupled with the labor side's economic perspective, the two sides did not reach an agreement. Later, after the government and trade unions conducted multi-faceted persuasion and education, the labor and capital sides gradually realized that only by jointly improving management can they overcome difficulties and maintain production. By late April, the plant formally established a labor-capital consultation meeting, re-negotiated, and reached several specific agreements on improving management.

### 南京私营永利铔厂  劳资协力改善经营  克服严重困难收支接近平衡

    劳资协力改善经营
    克服严重困难收支接近平衡
    【新华社二十日讯】南京私营永利铔厂改善经营管理，已使生产从严重困难中转上正常道路。该厂是全国第一大化学肥料厂，过去月产肥田粉三千余吨，但因经营不善，曾在今春通货膨胀停止后受到严重困难。为克服困难，该厂劳资双方经过多次协商，在经营管理上作了以下若干改善：
    按生产营业需要改变了组织机构
    首先是按生产和营业需要改变了组织机构。过去该厂连同其他两个碱厂，除总管理处以外，还有汉口、广州等十一个经理处。根据三月份的统计，该厂事务部门的人员多至占全厂职工的三分之一。如单发放工薪米粮的职员就有八个人，点心厨房的厨子就有五十多个。现在该厂已开始局部地调整了不适应生产要求的生产组织，增设了需要的组织。如为了大量向农村推销，该厂仅在六合县就设了一百二十处试验站，指导农民使用肥田粉。这样，该公司就可以不单纯依赖于国营企业的收购，而逐步自力解决销路问题。同时，该公司又将事务部门中年轻力壮的工人抽调至技术部门学习，把过去不参加生产的警卫队员四十二人动员回乡生产，并适当地调动了不称职职员的工作。
    开始认真建立成本计算制度
    其次是开始建立了成本计算制度。过去该厂生产、建设都是没有计划的。该厂在解放后资金异常困难时期，曾花了很多钱去修建不迫切需要的房屋。在修建工程中该厂是不计算成本的。例如，修一只船花了三千多石米，几乎可以买一只轮船。该厂过去只计算市场利润而不计算生产成本，因此在原材料的采购和使用上浪费很大，贪污营私现象也相当严重。在进行改善生产管理后，该厂资方已自五月份开始，逐月制订生产计划，并建立了采购、保管、领取、验收、原材料耗量、成品统计表报等制度。自六月份起，又实行了预决算制度，每旬公布一次收支概况。该厂并已清理物资，作到了全厂物资的统一调配，消除了积压资金和浪费的现象。
    工人自愿减低工薪福利待遇
    再次是工人自愿适当地减低了工薪和福利待遇，提高了劳动积极性。过去该厂职工薪金是比较高的。管理职员最高薪金达五百四十八个折实单位，一般的也近四百个单位。勤杂人员的薪金一般的也近一百五十个单位。职工福利待遇也相当高。如点心津贴每人每月即为四五十个单位。经过劳资协商后，职工薪金一般地减低了四分之一。该厂工会又发动各车间建立了生产委员会，推动工人积极生产。现凡成立了生产委员会的车间，职工迟到早退的现象已经消灭。
    该厂经过上述改进后，生产成本已大为降低。如四月份仅厉行节约和减低工资一项就使成本降低了百分之二十左右。加以目前系肥田粉的销售旺季，产品供不应求，因而该厂的收支已接近平衡。
    该厂在经营管理上的各种初步改善，是劳资协商的结果。鉴于该厂负债过巨，使生产陷于严重困难，该厂劳资双方曾于三月下旬举行生产座谈会，但因资方片面强调工人劳动纪律不好、工资过高，并有完全依赖政府解决困难的想法，加以劳方又有经济观点，致双方未达成协议。后经政府、工会进行多方劝导、教育，才使劳资双方逐渐认识了只有共同协力改善经营管理，才能克服困难，维持生产。至四月下旬，该厂正式成立劳资协商会议，重新协商，才获致关于改善经营管理的几项具体协议。
