Xinhua News Agency, August 30th—In order to cover up its blatant aggression against our country's territory of Taiwan, the Truman government, thirty-six hours after the Matthews incident, staged another farce of ordering MacArthur to retract his statement on Taiwan. In his telegram to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, MacArthur frankly confessed the U.S.'s aggressive ambitions towards Taiwan. MacArthur blatantly pointed out that Taiwan is the linchpin of the so-called U.S. Pacific natural defense line, which must be controlled in order to "control every Asian seaport from Vladivostok to Singapore with air power" from this "defense line." This statement by MacArthur embarrassed and flustered the Truman government, which was still using the hypocritical propaganda that "the U.S. has not invaded Chinese territory" as a cover, and it had no choice but to order MacArthur to retract his statement on the 26th.

After MacArthur announced the retraction of his statement, the White House spokesperson, in order to "avoid external misunderstanding of the U.S. attitude towards Taiwan," issued a letter from Truman to Austin on the 28th, praising Austin's outrageous lies in his letter to Lie on August 25th, namely that the U.S. actions towards Taiwan "did not infringe upon Chinese territory." U.S. officials also hinted that there seemed to be a policy difference between MacArthur and Truman and Austin on the Taiwan issue, emphasizing that "in foreign relations, there can only be one voice stating the government's attitude" (U.S. Information Service). However, this chaotic and contradictory approach by U.S. officials cannot hide the crime of invading our country's territory of Taiwan. A United Press Washington dispatch on the 28th inadvertently revealed the truth: "Some say that MacArthur's statement on Taiwan is in line with current U.S. Far East policy."

　　美国政府又一丑剧
    麦克阿瑟坦白供出侵台野心
    杜鲁门慌忙令他撤回这声明
    【新华社三十日讯】杜鲁门政府为了掩盖其对我国领土台湾的公然侵略，在马休斯事件三十六小时之后，又演出了一幕命令麦克阿瑟撤回其关于台湾的声明的丑剧。按麦克阿瑟在其致美国海外退伍军人协会的电报中，曾坦白地供出了美国对台湾的侵略野心。麦克阿瑟明目张胆地指出台湾是所谓美国太平洋天然防线中的总枢纽，必须加以控制，以便从这一条“防线”，“用空军控制自海参崴至新加坡的每一亚洲海港”。麦克阿瑟这一声明，使至今仍在用“美国并未侵犯中国领土”的虚伪宣传作为掩饰的杜鲁门政府，深感狼狈和慌乱，不得不于二十六日命令麦克阿瑟撤回他的声明。
    在麦克阿瑟宣布撤消他的声明以后，白宫发言人为了所谓“避免外间误解美国对台湾的态度”，于二十八日发表了杜鲁门致奥斯汀的一封信，赞扬奥斯汀在八月二十五日致赖伊信中的漫天大谎，即美国对台湾的行动，“并未侵犯中国领土”。美国官方同时暗示，在台湾问题上，麦克阿瑟与杜鲁门、奥斯汀之间，似乎存在着政策上的分歧，强调“在对外关系上，只能有一个声音申叙政府的态度”（美国新闻处）。但是，美国官方这种混乱而又矛盾百出的作法，是掩饰不住侵略我国领土台湾的罪行的。合众社华盛顿二十八日电就又不小心地露出了马脚：“有些人说，麦克阿瑟关于台湾的声明，是符合目前美国的远东政策的。”
