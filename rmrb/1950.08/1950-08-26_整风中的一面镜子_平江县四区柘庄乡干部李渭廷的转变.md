　　A Mirror in the Rectification Campaign
    ——The Transformation of Li Weiting, a Cadre from Zhezhuang Township, Fourth District, Pingjiang County
    By our reporter Li Wen
  Courageously Fighting Landlords Gained the Support of the Masses
    Li Weiting's two previous generations had no paddy fields; his grandfather and father were bamboo craftsmen (bamboo ware workers) their entire lives. Li Weiting also mainly made a living as a bamboo craftsman, buying more than four mu of land, and with a family of four, life was still very poor. After liberation, when he heard the working comrades explain the policies of the People's Government, he felt that every sentence was in line with his wishes and was very happy. When the working comrades asked him if he could do work, he said, "Without someone to lead the way, I don't understand anything!" The working comrades told him that working in the village only required being selfless and enthusiastic in serving the masses. When the autumn grain collection began last year, he was selected as an evaluator. He thought to himself, "Now the poor have turned over, and no one can violate the government's grain collection methods." The landlord's henchmen and the baojia head insisted on "average apportionment," so Li Weiting stood up to oppose it, but felt that his strength was weak. He first mobilized three poor peasant activists among the evaluators and argued with the baojia head. At the same time, he actively united forces, and among the thirty evaluators in the village, they united more than twenty and smashed the landlord's scheme to shift the burden. The villagers said, "Li Weiting did a good deed for everyone." Wherever he went, the masses greeted him enthusiastically.
    Bureaucratic Style of District Cadres Led to His Arrogance, Conceit, and Commandism
    Last October, the landlords let their lackey Zhang Hequan (former puppet township head, Kuomintang member) organize a fake peasant association, appointing himself as the director of the peasant association. His godson, Qin Fangxiong (Three Youth League squad leader), was the deputy director. Because Li Weiting had prestige in the village and was trusted by the district, he was also made a member. Most of the other peasant association members were controlled by bad elements. Li Weiting was the only upright peasant. When rent reduction began this spring, the local tyrant Zhang Jiongzhong was executed, which dampened the arrogance of the bad elements and boosted morale. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, Zhang Hequan voluntarily resigned as director of the peasant association, handing it over to Li Paijun, a poor peasant, and went behind the scenes to control the peasant association. Qin Fangxiong also let his relative replace him in his position.
    When the district rent reduction work team arrived in the village (the township had not yet been established at that time), although they knew that the peasant association organization in the village was seriously impure, they did not deeply mobilize the masses to seriously rectify the peasant ranks. Instead, they simply relied on the activist Li Weiting to carry out the rent reduction struggle. The rent reduction and deposit refund in the village were successful, with more than five hundred dan of rent grain and deposits refunded, which solved the difficulties of the spring famine. Li Weiting was active and firm in the rent reduction struggle. He let his son take care of the family's production, devoting all his energy to leading the peasants to hold meetings and fight, working all day long without receiving a single grain of the fruits of the struggle. He was also able to break away from personal feelings and take the lead in reasoning with the landlords. The landlord Li Xiaozhou (his relative) once secretly sent him a silver dollar; he exposed it publicly at a mass meeting, winning the support and praise of the broad masses. However, because Wang, the district head working in the village, only blindly praised Li Weiting and rarely, if ever, educated him or specifically helped him to lead more activists and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses, he was only satisfied with his activity and competence and his ability to "complete tasks." He only consulted him alone on matters, and he was the only one allowed to attend the village cadre meetings held in the district. The masses reflected, "District Head Wang only has Li Weiting in his heart." This also made Li Weiting increasingly arrogant and conceited, looking down on the masses. He only looked to the superiors and did not consult with the masses, developing a serious style of paternalism and commandism. At the village-wide mass meeting to celebrate the victory of rent reduction, Li Weiting even said aggressively, "If it weren't for me firing cannons at the landlords; if you don't 'rely' on me, Li Weiting, don't even think about eating so many fruits!" Li Weiting handled all the village work single-handedly, acting arbitrarily. Without discussing it with the peasant association, he arbitrarily dismissed two peasant association members who had made mistakes; he simply announced at a mass meeting that the militia captain Qin Yishu was not doing his job, eating the landlord's things, and embezzling public funds, and then decided to exonerate him. Without going through the peasant association or the masses, he appointed Hu Zhisheng as the militia captain. Every time he held a meeting, he would say one thing, and if someone said something wrong, they would be severely criticized by him. The masses had opinions but dared not speak out in person. Li Weiting, however, thought that the masses all believed in him: "I don't seek food or clothing, and I work wholeheartedly for the masses. Who could be dissatisfied with me!" The masses gossiped behind his back: "Li Weiting has a firm stance and works actively. Who doesn't say he's good? It's just that after the rent reduction, he is too dictatorial."
    Bad Elements Took the Opportunity to Counterattack, and Li Weiting was "Struggled" Against
    Before the wave of the rent reduction struggle, the bad elements Zhang Hequan, Qin Fangxiong, etc., who had been lurking, saw an opportunity and stepped up their activities. On the one hand, they tried their best to provoke and win over Li Paijun, the director of the peasant association, alienating him from Li Weiting, saying things like, "Li Weiting said to the district head that Li Paijun is a good-for-nothing," and "If Li Weiting is overthrown, Paijun can take power alone." On the other hand, they exaggerated Li Weiting's shortcomings and fabricated rumors, inciting the masses to become even more dissatisfied with him. Originally, Li Weiting's younger brother's family was very poor, and after the evaluation by the group leader representatives, they lent him two dan and five dou of accumulated grain, but Qin Fangxiong said that Li Weiting had privately given his younger brother three dan of accumulated grain. Qin Yishu was exonerated, and Qin Fangxiong incited and won over the masses in his area, saying, "The captain we elected is not bad. We must ask Li Weiting why he dismissed him." In early June, District Head Wang went to the village. At a women's representative meeting, the candidate list for the village chairman was discussed. Someone proposed Li Weiting, and it was passed by a show of hands without much deliberation. The representatives returned to their respective groups and mistakenly reported that Li Weiting had become the village chairman. Li Weiting also issued notices to hold meetings in the name of the village chairman, which aroused even more dissatisfaction among the masses. Qin Fangxiong and others seized the opportunity, stepped up collusion, and seduced more than 120 people to jointly accuse Li Weiting in the county. When District Head Wang learned of this news, he still did not examine the problems in his work and promptly correct Li Weiting's practice of being divorced from the masses. He did not deeply mobilize the masses to expose the conspiracy of the bad elements, but simply called Qin Fangxiong and others together, severely reprimanded them, and returned to the district. Qin Fangxiong and others took advantage of the legitimate status of Li Paijun, the director of the peasant association (who had been bought by Qin, etc.), to convene a mass meeting on June 20 to "struggle" against and insult Li Weiting. Of the more than 200 people who attended the meeting, only 98 were members. The bad elements manipulated the meeting, and Qin Fangxiong served as the temporary chairman of the meeting. When upright peasants raised objections, the bad elements shouted, "Disturbing the meeting, tie him up!" After the meeting, the landlords became very arrogant: "This is great, the activists have been overthrown!" "Li Weiting has been overthrown, let's see who dares to take Li Dongxuan's (landlord) money (embezzled funds that were liquidated)!" The upright peasants dared not speak, but shook their heads and sighed: "It's their world again!"
    Earnestly Changing Work Style and Regaining Mass Trust
    At this time, it aroused the attention of the district leaders. The county and district sent cadres to the village to carry out work. On the one hand, the district government detained the chief saboteur Qin Fangxiong (Zhang Hequan had hidden himself); on the other hand, they openly reviewed the shortcomings in the work of the district and Li Weiting among the masses, exposing the landlord's counterattack conspiracy. They went deep into the various groups to mobilize the peasants, reorganize the peasant association, clean up the bad elements who had infiltrated the peasant association, and elect activists with good work styles to enrich and improve the leadership of the peasant association.
    Li Weiting was transferred to the county for training. When he first arrived at the cadre training class, he was in low spirits, unwilling to attend classes, and did not speak at discussion meetings. At the first self-criticism meeting, he denied all his shortcomings. He said, "I fired cannons at the landlords and reduced hundreds of dan of rent. Am I not worthy of the masses? The last time the masses 'struggled' against me, I can only blame them for not being clear-headed (not being aware) and being used by bad elements. What mistakes do I have!?" Student Yi Huanwen gave him an opinion: "You do things by coercion and command, the masses are dissatisfied, and the bad elements can take advantage of it." Other comrades also helped him analyze his mistakes, and he became furious: "Don't I have any merits at all? Since liberation, I haven't had a day of rest. It's not good to do good, it really makes me discouraged!" The leaders of the cadre training class, in view of Li Weiting's ideological situation, slowly guided him: "Everyone knows that you are active and successful in your work, so they call you to study! Helping you to examine your mistakes is to help you progress and work better." Li Weiting thought again: "Everyone has shortcomings, it's not just me alone, let me see what others say." Later, he saw that many comrades had humbly examined their work and ideological style, and also analyzed that sheltering mistakes is like sheltering sores on one's own body. If you don't remove this sore, it will grow bigger and bigger. After further enlightenment from the leaders, he began to realize the importance of examining his mistakes and wanted to expose his mistakes. But then he had new concerns: "The superiors will say that I am not frank, why didn't I examine myself before?" After the comrades in the class discovered this, they had individual talks with him to dispel his concerns. In this way, he deeply examined his shortcomings. After the examination, Li Weiting was refreshed, spoke enthusiastically during discussions, studied actively, and copied notes stroke by stroke during his afternoon nap. He said, "If I had studied like this earlier, I wouldn't have made such big mistakes; after returning to the village, I must carefully connect with the masses and do a good job."
    Back in the village, Li Weiting introduced the rectification situation in the county at a village-wide representative meeting and examined his mistakes one by one. He sincerely said, "In the past, I didn't know how to do work. This time I learned a lot of knowledge and only then did I understand where I was wrong. I washed myself clean from beginning to end, as if I had been 'reborn,' and I must learn from the peasant friends in the future." The peasants were happy as they listened and nodded: "These are heartfelt words. Weiting is very determined, but his 'personality' (work style) is not good." "The People's Government is really good, a bad 'personality' won't work either."
    Li Weiting is enthusiastic about the village's work, and his attitude is also kinder. The village is brewing to clean up some of the accumulated grain of the middle peasants. He actively suggested to the peasant association: "The middle and poor peasants are one family, and we can't point our guns at ourselves." The representatives at the meeting boomed, raised their hands, and unanimously approved his opinion. When the peasant association was adjusting its organization, it did not allow even peasants with minor problems, or even just those who had fought with others, to join the association. He also actively suggested: "As long as they are working peasants, they can apply to join the association; if they have minor shortcomings, the peasant association can educate them to correct them after they join." The peasant association also accepted his suggestion.
    As Li Weiting's work style changed, people's views of him also changed. In early August, when they were brewing to formally establish the township, the representatives of the peasant congress unanimously recommended him as a candidate for the township government. The villagers also said, "Weiting is resolute and active. As long as his work style changes, it is still good for him to be the chairman." Li Weiting asked the representatives: "If you let me work again, you must examine me more. If you don't examine me, it won't work. If I stumble, you must quickly pull me up!" The representatives also encouraged him: "Be bold and work hard. You made mistakes before, and the bad elements tripped you. In the future, we will help you and not let you stumble again."
    On August 5, the Zhezhuang Township (equivalent to an administrative village in North China) People's Government was formally established. At the township-wide election meeting, Li Weiting was elected as the chairman of the first township government with the most votes.

　　整风中的一面镜子
    ——平江县四区柘庄乡干部李渭廷的转变
    本报记者  力文
  勇敢向地主斗争获得了群众拥护
    李渭廷的前两代，垅田皆无，祖父、父亲都做了一辈子篾工（竹器工人）。李渭廷也主要靠做篾工过活，买了四亩多田，一家四口人，生活仍很贫苦。解放后听到工作同志讲解人民政府政策，他觉得句句合他的心意，十分高兴。工作同志问他能不能做工作，他说：“没人领路，我什么都不懂啊！”工作同志告诉他，在村里工作只要大公无私，热心为群众办事就行。去年秋征开始，他被选为评议员。他心里想：“现在穷人翻身了，政府的征粮办法，谁也不能破坏。”地主狗腿、保甲长硬要“平均摊派”，李渭廷便起来反对，但感到自己力量单薄，便首先活动了评议员中的三个贫农积极分子，与保甲长辩理。同时又积极分头联合力量，全村三十个评议员中，他们团结了二十多个，打垮了地主转嫁负担的诡计。村中群众说：“李渭廷为大家办了一件好事。”他走到那里，那里的群众便热情的向他打招呼。
    区干部官僚主义促成他的骄傲自大、强迫命令
    去年十月，地主们让走狗张合全（前伪乡长、国民党员）组织假农会，自任农会主任。他的干儿子秦放雄（三青团分队长）为副主任。因为李渭廷在村中有威信，区上又信任，也让他当了一个委员。其他农会委员，多为坏分子掌握。正派农民只李渭廷一人。今春减租开始时，该村大恶霸张炯中伏法，打击了坏分子的气焰，群情振奋。张合全见风头不顺，便自动辞掉农会主任，交给贫农成份的李排军，转入后台掌握农会。秦放雄也让本家哥哥代替了他的职位。
    区减租工作队到达该村（当时尚未建乡），虽知该村农协组织严重不纯，但表面上看到农会有了调整，便未深入发动群众认真整顿农民队伍，而是单纯依靠积极分子李渭廷开展减租斗争。该村减租退押是有成绩的，计退出租谷押金五百余石，解决了春荒困难。李渭廷在减租斗争中积极坚定。家中生产让儿子一个人去做，自己全部精力领导农民开会斗争，整天忙工作，未分一粒果实，又能打破情面，带头向地主讲理。地主李筱舟（他的亲房）曾暗送他一块光洋；他在群众大会上当众揭露，获得广大群众的拥护和称赞。但由于在该村工作的王区长对李渭廷只一味盲目表扬，很少甚至没有对李渭廷进行教育，具体帮助他如何更多的带头积极分子，发动广大群众的积极性；只满足于他一个人的积极能干，能“完成任务”，有事只找他一人商量，区上召开的村干会，也都让他一人参加。群众反映：“王区长心眼里，只有李渭廷一个人。”这也使得李渭廷日渐骄傲自大起来，看不起群众，有事只找上级，而不和群众商量，发展了严重的包办代替，强迫命令的作风。在庆祝减租胜利的全村群众大会上，李渭廷更盛气凌人的说：“不是我向地主开大炮；不‘搭攀’（依靠）我李渭廷，你们莫想吃那样多果实！”村上工作，李渭廷一手包办，独断独行。未经过农会讨论，他擅自撤消了两个犯错误的农协委员；自卫队长秦怡书不做工作，吃地主东西，贪污公款，他也只在群众大会上简单宣布一下，便决定洗刷了。又不通过农会和群众，委派胡治生当了自卫队长。每次开会都是他讲一套，别人有一句话说错，便会遭他厉言厉色的批评，群众有意见也不敢当面讲出来。李渭廷却自以为群众都相信他：“我不图吃，不图穿，满心为群众工作，谁还不满意我！”群众背地议论：“李渭廷立场稳，工作积极，那个不说好；就是减租后，一个人太专权了。”
    坏分子乘机反攻李渭廷挨“斗争”
    在减租斗争浪潮前，一度潜伏的坏分子张合全、秦放雄等，见有机可乘，又大肆活动了。一面极力挑拨和拉拢农会主任李排军，离间他和李渭廷的关系，说什么：“李渭廷在区长面前说李排军是饭桶”，“打倒了李渭廷，排军便可独自掌权了。”一面夸大李渭廷的毛病和造谣生非，煽动群众对他更加不满。本来李渭廷的弟弟家中很穷，经组长代表的评议，借给他二石五斗积谷，秦放雄却说李渭廷个人私自给弟弟三石积谷。秦怡书被洗刷了，秦放雄煽动和拉拢他那一片的群众说：“我们选的队长并不坏，要问问李渭廷为什么撤消他？”六月初，王区长到该村，在一个妇女代表会上，酝酿选村主席的候选名单，有人提出李渭廷，没有很好酝酿，便举手通过了。代表们回到各组，误传为李渭廷当了村主席。李渭廷也以村主席的名义下通知开会，更引起了群众不满。秦放雄等便抓紧时机，加紧串通与诱惑了一百二十多人联名到县控告李渭廷。这消息被王区长知道了，他仍没有检讨自己工作中的毛病，及时纠正李渭廷脱离群众的作风，深入发动群众，揭穿坏分子阴谋，只是把秦放雄等叫在一块，大加训斥一顿，便回区上了。秦放雄等又利用农会主任李排军（这时已为秦等收买）的合法地位，于六月二十日召开群众大会，“斗争”与侮辱了李渭廷，到会二百多人中，只有九十八人是会员，坏分子操纵了会场，秦放雄自任大会临时主席。正派农民提出意见，坏分子即喊：“捣乱会场，把他捆起来！”会后，地主们大为嚣张：“这下就好了，积极分子打倒了！”“李渭廷打倒了，看那个还敢取李栋选（地主）的钱（被清算出的贪污款）！”正派农民不敢说话，只是摇头叹息：“又是他们的天下了！”
    认真转变作风重获群众信任
    此时，才引起区领导上的注意。县、区派干部到村开展工作。一面由区政府扣压了首要破坏分子秦放雄（张合全已隐蔽起来）；一面在群众中公开检讨区上和李渭廷工作中的缺点，揭穿地主反攻的阴谋。分别深入各组发动农民，整理农会，清洗了混进农会的坏分子，选举工作积极、作风好的农民，充实与健全了农会领导。
    李渭廷调到县里受训。他初到干部训练班时，情绪低落，不愿上课，讨论会不发言。在第一次检讨大会上，他把自己的毛病，抹杀个一干二净。他说：“我向地主放大炮，减出几百石租，难道还对不起群众吗？上次群众‘斗争’我，只怪他们不醒脑筋（不觉悟），受坏分子利用，我有么子错误！？”学员易焕文给他提意见：“你做事强迫命令，群众不满，坏分子才能钻空子。”其他同志也帮助他分析错误，他大发脾气：“我就一点功绩没有了？自从解放后，我没安生休息过一天，做好不讨好，真叫我灰心啊！”干训班领导同志针对李渭廷的思想情况，慢慢诱导他：“大家都知道你工作积极有成绩，才叫你学习啊！帮助你检讨，是帮助你进步，更好的工作。”李渭廷又想：“人人都有毛病，也不光我一个人，看看别人再说。”以后他看到许多同志虚心检查了自己的工作、思想作风，还分析到庇护错误就好像是庇护自己身上生的疮一样，如果不去掉这个疮，便会越长越大。又经过领导同志的启发，他开始认识了检讨错误的重要，想把错误暴露出来。但他又产生了新的顾虑：“上级会说我不坦白，以前为什么不检讨？”班里同志发觉后，又和他进行了个别谈话，打消他的顾虑。这样他就深刻的检讨了自己的毛病。检讨后，李渭廷情绪焕发了，讨论时踊跃发言，学习积极，午睡时还一笔一划的抄笔记。他说：“早有这样学习，我也不会犯那样大错误了；回村后，一定要好好联系群众，搞好工作。”
    回到村里，李渭廷在全村代表大会上，介绍了县里整风情况，一条条检讨了自己的错误。他诚恳地说：“过去我不懂怎样做工作，这次学了不少知识，才懂得错在那里。我从头到底洗了一个干净，像又生过了‘一道’，以后一定好好向农友们学习。”农民们高兴得一面听，一面点头：“这是掏心话，渭廷人顶坚决，就是‘个性’（作风）不好。”“人民政府真正好，‘个性’不好也不行。”
    李渭廷热心村中工作，待人也和气了。村上正酝酿清理某些中农的积谷，他积极向农会建议：“中贫农是一家人，自己的枪不能打自己。”开会的代表们轰的一声，手举起来，一致赞成他的意见。农会在调整组织时，对于多少有点毛病，甚至只是和别人打过架的农民都不让入会。他又积极建议：“只要是劳动农民都可以申请入会；有点小缺点，入会后，农协会可教育他改正。”农会又接受了他的建议。
    随着李渭廷作风的转变，人们对他的看法也变了。八月初，酝酿正式建乡的时候，农代会代表们一致推举他当乡政府的候选人，村中群众也说：“渭廷坚决积极，只要作风改了，还是他当主席好。”李渭廷向代表提出要求：“大家再让我工作，要多检讨我，不检讨就不得了，我一绊倒，你们就赶快把我扯起来！”代表们也鼓励他：“你大胆干吧，以前你犯了错，坏分子绊倒你，以后，我们扶助你，不让你再绊倒了。”
    八月五日，柘庄乡（相当华北的行政村）人民政府正式成立，在全乡选举大会上，李渭廷以最多票数，当选为第一届乡政府主席。
