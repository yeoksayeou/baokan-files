Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 5th. Students and teachers in the Northwest region are closely integrating their summer study activities with local characteristics and current tasks. In areas with multiple ethnic groups, the focus is on studying the ethnic policies stipulated in the Common Program. In Xinjiang, nearly a thousand students from various ethnic groups organized a summer political study session in Dihua. In that province, 1,200 people, including middle school principals, education section chiefs of county people's governments, and students graduating this year who wish to work in education, participated in a summer training class for teachers. The Qinghai Province Summer Teachers' Study Session is currently using Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism" and Gao Gang's "Speech at the Inner Mongolia Cadre Conference" as required subjects, and conducting discussions in connection with the ethnic situation in Qinghai. Before returning to their hometowns, students above the middle school level in Gansu Province underwent short-term studies on current events and ethnic policies. After returning, they are conducting mass work under the guidance of local people's governments and with the assistance of local Communist Youth League organizations.

In areas where land reform is about to be carried out this autumn, the main focus is on studying and publicizing the Land Reform Law. More than 2,300 students in Xi'an who are about to return to their hometowns are studying the Land Reform Law and then dividing into groups by region, preparing to use meetings, chats, dramas and other methods to publicize various policies related to land reform after returning home. The 4,000 students remaining in Xi'an have participated in the Youth Academy sponsored by the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League. In addition to studying the history of the New Democratic Revolution and current affairs, the academy also holds lectures on youth issues and carries out cultural, recreational, and sports activities. In addition, the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League also held a cadre study session during the summer vacation, preparing to systematically summarize the experience of student work in the previous semester and formulate future work guidelines.

　　西北区各省市各族师生
    利用暑期开展各种学习
    【新华社西安五日电】西北区各省市学生暑期学习活动正紧密结合各地特点和当前任务进行。在多民族地区主要是学习共同纲领上所规定的民族政策。新疆近千名的各族学生在迪化组织了暑期学生政治学习会。该省中学校校长、县人民政府教育科科长和本年毕业后愿从事教育工作的学生共一千二百名参加了教员暑期训练班。青海省暑期教员学习会现正以刘少奇的《论国际主义与民族主义》、高岗的《在内蒙干部会议上的讲话》两个文件作为必修科目，联系青海民族情况进行研讨。甘肃省中学以上学生在回乡以前，经过了短期的时事学习和民族政策的学习，回乡后，在当地人民政府指导和各地青年团组织协助下，正在进行群众工作。
    在今年秋后即将进行土地改革的地区，则以学习和宣传土地改革法为主。西安市将要回乡的二千三百余名学生，在学习土地改革法以后，正按地区分成小组，准备回乡后利用集会、漫谈、演戏等方式宣传有关土地改革的各种政策。留在西安市的四千名学生已参加了青年团西安市工作委员会主办的青年学园。该园除学习新民主主义革命史和时事问题外，并举办青年问题讲座和展开文化娱乐、体育活动。此外，青年团西安市工作委员会并在暑期中举办了干部学习会，准备系统地总结上学期学生工作经验和拟定今后的工作方针。
