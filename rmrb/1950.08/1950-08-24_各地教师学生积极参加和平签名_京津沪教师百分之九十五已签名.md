　　Teachers and Students Actively Participate in Peace Signatures
　　95% of Teachers in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai Have Signed
　　[By Our Newspaper] Since the movement to sign for the defense of world peace has been enthusiastically launched throughout China, teachers and students everywhere have successively expressed their strength and determination to defend peace through practical actions.

　　In large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, more than 95% of the teachers have signed. In small and medium-sized cities and vast rural areas, teachers are also actively carrying out this work. From the twenty-four letters written to this newspaper in response to the movement to defend world peace, it can be seen that among the 4,788 signatories, 4,467 are primary and secondary school teachers and students who are receiving their education.

　　Teachers in various places first studied the documents of the movement to defend world peace, then held discussions with students in groups, and then, in light of the actual situation, mobilized and led students to carry out publicity to the broad masses in various ways to collect peace signatures. For example, after a chat led by teachers at Xinji Middle School in Xinji County, Hebei Province, all 781 teachers and students signed within one day. They also used temple fairs to conduct two publicity campaigns to rural people, launching the signatures of 13,320 people. Six elementary school teachers in the 13th district of Beijing used a door-to-door publicity method to mobilize more than 8,000 people to sign. Under the leadership of all the teachers, the students of Longyao Middle School carried out publicity to the working masses who were repairing the dike, and in half a day, more than 7,000 people signed. Under the leadership of the teachers, all primary and secondary schools in Datong City, Shanxi Province, organized student speech contests, especially focusing on "Defending the World Peace Movement" and "Sino-Soviet Friendship" as central issues for discussion, which improved students' understanding of the international situation. Many students said, "Now I not only hate aggressive war, but also understand the great significance of the unity of the international working class. The peace camp led by the Soviet Union is growing stronger, and war can be stopped." After publicizing to the rural masses, the teachers and students of Linjin County Normal School in Shanxi Province also mobilized many farmers to participate in the signing. All the teachers and students of the 7th District Elementary School in Shouyang County, Shanxi Province, wrote to the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, saying: "In order to defend the fruits of victory and oppose American imperialist aggression, we must work hard in the future, strengthen our studies, and take practical actions to increase the strength to defend peace."

　　各地教师学生积极参加和平签名
    京津沪教师百分之九十五已签名
    【本报讯】自保卫世界和平签名运动在我国各地热烈展开以来，各地的教师和学生，相继以实际的行动表示了他们对于保卫和平的力量与决心。
    在北京、上海、天津等大城市里，百分之九十五以上的教师们都签了名。在各地中小城市与广大农村中，教师们也正在积极进行这一工作。从写给本报响应保卫世界和平运动的二十四封信中可以看出来，在签名的四千七百八十八人中，就有四千四百六十七人是中小学教师和正在受他们教育的学生。
    各地的教师们首先学习了保卫世界和平运动的各项文件，接着与学生们分组进行讨论，然后结合实际情况发动和领导学生们用各种方式向广大的群众展开宣传，征集和平签名。如河北省辛集中学在教师们领导的一次漫谈会之后，全校师生七百八十一人在一天内都签了名，他们并利用庙会向农村群众做了两次宣传，发动了一万三千三百二十人的签名。北京十三区小学的六位小学教师用挨门挨户的宣传方式，发动了八千多人的签名。隆尧中学的学生们在全体教师的领导下，向正在修堤的工农群众进行宣传，半天之内，就有七千多人签了名。山西大同市全市中小学在教师们的领导下，组织了学生讲演比赛会，特别把“保卫世界和平运动”和“中苏友好”作为中心问题进行讨论，使学生对国际形势的认识提高一步。许多学生都说：“现在我不仅是憎恨侵略战争，而且也了解了国际工人阶级团结的伟大意义。以苏联为首的和平阵营正日渐强大，战争是可以制止的。”山西临晋县立师范的师生们，在向农村群众宣传之后，也发动很多农民参加签名。山西寿阳县七区小学的全体师生写信给中国保卫世界和平大会说：“为了保卫胜利的果实，反对美帝侵略，我们今后要努力工作，加强学习，以实际行动来增加保卫和平的力量。”
