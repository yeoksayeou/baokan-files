　　Remembering Jinggang Mountain
    Han Wei

　　In the autumn of 1927, the Kuomintang reactionaries in Wuhan finally betrayed the Great Revolution, and Communists in various places led armed uprisings. At that time, I was working in a regiment of the Fourth Army of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Army. The regimental commander, Comrade Lu Deming, was a member of our Party. The Party ordered him to lead his troops in an uprising and rush to Nanchang to participate in the general riots. The uprising received unanimous response from the entire regiment, so they broke away from their garrison and headed straight for Nanchang. Unexpectedly, halfway there, news came of the failure of the Nanchang Uprising, so the troops turned back to northwestern Jiangxi and eastern Hunan to participate in the Autumn Harvest Uprising led by Comrade Mao Zedong. Along the way, they were warmly welcomed by revolutionary workers and peasants, and a large number of township farmers' association members, trade union members, peasant self-defense forces, and worker pickets poured into the troops. By the eve of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, our regiment had expanded to three regiments, becoming the main force of the Autumn Harvest Uprising in Hunan Province.

　　The Autumn Harvest Uprising also failed, and the main force of the First Regiment suffered heavy casualties. The Ninth Company of the Third Battalion of my regiment, originally with more than a hundred people, lost half of its members in a single battle at Jinping. This young Chinese Red Army (then called the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Army) suffered a severe setback. But it did not completely collapse as the enemy had hoped. In the face of extreme revolutionary difficulties, and with many people feeling discouraged and disappointed, the remaining Red Army, under the banner of Comrade Mao Zedong, still gathered together and marched towards Jinggang Mountain, starting a new revolution.

　　On the way to Jinggang Mountain, Comrade Mao Zedong arrived at the troops alone. He had a white towel around his neck, his hair was slightly shorter than it is now, and he wore an old Western suit. From a distance, he looked like a teacher. The team I was in was also dressed in a chaotic mix of clothing: some in military uniforms, some in civilian clothes. Later, I heard that Comrade Peng Dehuai's uprising troops were even more oddly dressed: wearing civilian clothes with a large piece of blue cloth wrapped around their heads.

　　Jinggang Mountain straddles the border between Hunan and Jiangxi provinces in the east and west, shields Guangdong in the south, and has a circumference of over 300 li. The mountain terrain is uneven, the rivers and valleys vary in width, and the mountain peaks are layered upon each other, with many cliffs and steep walls. Dozens of miles of high mountains are covered in dense forests, obscuring the sky and the sun. Only essential paths run through the forests and ravines. The mountain terrain is extremely dangerous, making it easy for combat and defense. Although the mountain lacks inhabitants, cotton, and salt, and is barren and desolate, the surrounding twenty-odd counties are all fertile plains that produce abundant cotton and have dense populations. Moreover, the mountain is rich in pumpkins, which often weigh around a hundred pounds. If the troops are besieged and run out of food, there is no need to panic as there are plenty of pumpkins to fill their bellies. In 1928, when the Red Army was besieged several times, everyone ate pumpkins every day, at every meal, to survive.

　　Jinggang Mountain is a good place, but soon after the Red Army arrived, the Eighth Army of the Kuomintang Hunan Army followed in pursuit. The enemy had an entire army, while we had only one regiment (actually only seven companies). Chairman Mao came up with a plan and proposed the slogan: "Concentrate on fighting battles, disperse to do mass work." On the one hand, he himself left two companies to guard Huangyangjie Ridge, fighting fiercely with the enemy's main force for three days and nights, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The enemy was never able to cross the ridge, keeping them out of the Jinggang Mountain valley. On the other hand, he sent two companies to outflank the enemy's rear, cutting off their transportation and supplies. The enemy was attacked from both sides and was forced to retreat. The Red Army preserved itself and drove away the enemy. This was the famous First Counter-Encirclement Campaign in Jinggang Mountain.

　　With the victory of the First Counter-Encirclement Campaign, the Jinggang Mountain Soviet area temporarily gained a foothold. In April 1928, Commander-in-Chief Zhu also brought three main regiments. The two Red Army units of Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Zhu De joined forces, forming six regiments in total, expanding the number to over 10,000, greatly boosting military morale. In the summer, the Kuomintang troops of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces jointly launched an encirclement and suppression campaign against Jinggang Mountain. Our army concentrated its forces and annihilated two of their regiments, and the remaining enemies fled in a panic. The Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign was also a complete victory.

　　Around the time of the Second Counter-Encirclement Campaign, the Jinggang Mountain Red Army, under the personal command of Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhu De, actively built up the army. Although material conditions were very poor at that time and there was a lack of experience in building the army, and the Red Army could not have a mature and sound set of organizational discipline and regulations like today, it made a good start in many aspects. For example, officers and soldiers were completely equal in political and economic life, and everyone lived and worked together. It is a complete fact that Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all military commanders carried grain from the foot of Jinggang Mountain to the top together with everyone else. The relationship between the army and the people was also very good. At that time, the Red Army rarely mobilized civilian labor, and if it was necessary to mobilize, they were given a certain wage. Even during the Third Counter-Encirclement Campaign in Jinggang Mountain, when a part of the main force marched eastward into Gan and Min provinces, even in a precarious situation, they strictly observed discipline towards the masses.

　　回忆井岗山
    韩伟
    一九二七年秋，武汉方面国民党反动派最后叛变了大革命，各地共产党人领导了武装起义。那时我正在国民党革命军第四集团军一个团里工作。团长卢德明同志是我党党员。党命令他率部起义，赶赴南昌参加总暴动。起义得到全团一致的响应，就脱离驻地直向南昌开拔。不料走到半道，忽得南昌起义失利的消息，部队遂折往赣西北、湘东，参加毛泽东同志领导下的秋收起义。路经各处，备受革命工农欢迎，大批乡农会委员、工会委员、农民自卫军、工人纠察队涌入了部队。至秋收暴动前夕，我们这个团便扩大到三个团。成为湘省秋收暴动的主力。
    秋收暴动又失利，主力第一团遭受严重伤亡，我团三营九连原百多人，金坪一次战斗伤亡一半。这一支年青的中国红军（当时名称是中国工农革命军），受到了严重挫折。但它并没有象敌人所想的那样完全垮台。在革命万分困难，不少人都灰心失望下，剩余的红军在毛泽东同志的旗帜下，仍然集合起来，向井岗山进发，开始了新的革命。
    到井岗山的途中，毛泽东同志单人赶到部队来，他脖子里围一条白毛巾，头上留着比现在稍短的头发，身上穿一套旧西装，远看去，俨然象个教员。我在的这个团队，也穿的乱七八槽：有军装，有便衣。后来听人说，彭德怀同志的起义的部队服装更出奇：身穿便衣，头上缠一块很大青布。
    井岗山这座山，东西跨湘赣两省边界，南屏广东，周围三百余里，山地高低不平，山河宽窄不一，山峰层层叠叠，且多悬崖削壁，高山数十里全是密林，遮蔽天日，必经之道才有小径穿插于树林壑壁间。山势险要异常，便于作战防守。山内虽然缺少人烟，缺棉缺盐，贫瘠荒凉，但四周二十多县却尽是产棉丰饶人烟稠密的平原。况且山内又盛产南瓜，瓜重常在百斤左右，如果部队被围粮绝，填肚皮的南瓜尽可不必恐慌。一九二八年红军几次被围，大家就是天天吃瓜，顿顿吃瓜，以瓜度日。
    井岗山是个好地方，但红军刚到不久，国民党湘军第八军便跟踪追进山来。敌人一个军，我们一个团（实际只有七个连）。毛主席想了办法，提出：“集中打仗，分散作群众工作”的口号，一面自己留下两个连扼守黄洋界岭，同敌人主力苦战三昼夜，给敌重大杀伤，敌始终未能超过该岭，拒该敌于井岗山夹谷；一面又派二个连迂回至敌人背后，截断其运输供给。敌腹背受敌，于是被迫退去，红军保存了自己，驱逐了敌人。这便是有名的井岗山第一次反围剿。
    一次反围剿胜利，井岗山苏区暂时站稳了脚根。一九二八年四月，朱总司令又带三个主力团来，毛泽东同志和朱德同志的两部红军会师了，共编成六个团，人数扩大至一万多，军威大振。夏季湘赣两省国民党军队会剿井岗山，我军集中兵力歼其两个团，残敌狼狈逃去。二次反围剿又获完全胜利。
    二次反围剿前后，井岗山红军在毛泽东朱德两同志亲手掌握下，积极建军。那时虽然物质条件很坏，建军经验缺乏，红军虽不能象今天这样有成熟的健全的一整套组织纪律制度，但在很多方面都作了良好的开端，如官兵政治经济生活一律平等，大家一块生活，一块劳动。朱总司令和一切军事指挥员和大家一块从井岗山下向山上挑粮，却完全是事实。军民关系上，也做的很好，当时红军很少动员民工，如必要动员，则给一定工资。就在井岗山三次反围剿，一部主力东进赣闽途中，虽处境危急，对群众纪律，也都严格遵守。
