Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: The summer grain collection in the North China region has largely been completed. The provinces collecting summer public grain in the North China region this year are Pingyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi, with a total task of 770 million jin. As of August 15th, Pingyuan Province had stored 267.33 million jin, accounting for over 90% of the province's total task. As of August 10th, Hebei Province had stored over 220 million jin, accounting for 65% of the province's total task. As of August 8th, Shanxi Province had stored 129.22 million jin, accounting for 91% of the province's total task. In total, the three provinces have stored over 610 million jin of wheat, accounting for 80% of the total summer grain collection in the region.

　　Before the summer grain collection in the North China region, people's representative conferences from all walks of life were generally convened in each county to conduct serious discussions on this matter, making the burdens between disaster areas and non-disaster areas, and between villages, fairer and more reasonable. During the summer grain collection, governments at all levels and the CCP committees mobilized cadres and Party members to examine privileged thinking and overcome village-based thinking, and called on Party members and cadres to take the lead in paying grain. Therefore, many areas completed the collection task entirely in a short period of time. The organization of grain transportation and storage work was generally better than in previous years. In Yuncheng Prefecture of Shanxi, Gaoyang and Jingxing counties of Hebei, grain depots were repaired in advance, grain transportation forces were organized uniformly, and grain collection methods were determined. Pingyuan Province learned from the Puyang grain transportation incident last year. Each grain depot had clear divisions of labor for route planning, vehicle command, migrant worker reception, and grain collection procedures, with dedicated personnel in charge of each. In the large warehouses and grain stations of Anyang and Liaocheng Prefectures, it only took two to three hours from when vehicles entered the station to report to the completion of the receipt, which satisfied the farmers. In order to ensure that deviations occurring during the work could be corrected in a timely manner, Pingyuan, Hebei, and Shanxi all organized summer grain collection inspection teams to conduct in-depth work inspections in various regions.

### 华北区夏征顺利  六亿余斤公粮入仓

　　华北区夏征顺利
    六亿余斤公粮入仓
    【新华社二十一日讯】华北区夏征公粮已大部入仓。华北区今年征收夏季公粮的省份为平原、河北、山西三省，总任务七亿七千万斤。平原省截至八月十五日止，已入仓二亿六千七百三十三万斤，为该省总任务的百分之九十强；河北省截至八月十日止，已入仓二亿二千余万斤，为该省总任务的百分之六十五；山西省截至八月八日止，已入仓一亿二千九百二十二万斤，为该省总任务的百分之九十一。总计三省先后入仓小麦已达六亿一千余万斤，为全区夏征公粮总数的百分之八十。
    华北区此次征收夏季公粮以前，各县一般都曾召开各界人民代表会议对此进行了认真的讨论，使灾区与非灾区、村与村之间的负担趋于公平合理。在夏征进行中，各级政府与中共党委又动员干部和党员检查特权思想及克服村本位思想，并号召党员、干部带头缴粮，故不少地区短期内即全部完成征收任务。在组织运粮入仓工作上，各地一般组织得比往年好。山西运城专区，河北高阳、井陉等县，都在事先修整粮库，统一组织运粮力量，确定收粮办法。平原省各地接受了去年濮阳运粮事件的教训，各粮库对路线计划、车辆指挥、民工招待、收粮手续等，都有明确分工，并由专人负责掌握。安阳、聊城两专区的大库粮站，自车辆入站报到至开完收据，仅历两、三小时，农民都表示满意。为保证在工作中发生偏差后能及时纠正，平原、河北、山西均曾组织夏征检查团深入各地检查工作。
