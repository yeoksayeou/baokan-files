China's Movement to Defend World Peace Online

　　The Beijiang Special District Committee of the Guangdong Province issued instructions to all counties on August 15, requesting that each county further expand the peace signature campaign in August and September, striving to have one million people in the entire Beijiang area participate in the peace signature campaign.

　　Huizhou seaman Chen Quan took the Stockholm Peace Declaration and went to every electric boat to publicize and explain it, soliciting signatures. He also wrote letters to his hometown, Hengsha Village, to mobilize the entire village to sign. In total, he mobilized more than 630 people to sign.

　　In late July, Panyu County counted that 100,000 people in the county had participated in the signature campaign. 15,000 people in District One of the county signed. More than 13,000 people in District Two signed. More than 12,000 people in Yudong District signed. More than 20,000 people in Yubei District signed. 11,000 people in District Three signed. A farmer in District One said: "The American imperialists are like mad dogs and will definitely be beaten to death."

　　Eighty percent of the farmers' associations and ninety percent of the primary schools in Huaxian County have responded to the movement against aggression and in support of peace. The signature station set up by the No. 1 Primary School in Chini Township alone had more than 4,000 people participating in the signature campaign. In total, more than 22,000 people in the county have participated in this movement.

　　The number of signatories in Sanshui County has reached 13,000.

　　More than 59,000 people in Nanhai County have participated in the signature campaign. In the past, farmers in the county were accustomed to greeting each other with "Have you had tea yet?" (Cantonese, meaning "Have you had tea?"), but now they replaced it with "Have you held the Farmers' Representative Conference? Have you participated in the peace signature campaign?"

　　Peace signature sites are also set up all along the highway from Shiqi to Macau. Overseas Chinese who had just returned to free New China from Hong Kong and Macau were moved by the motherland's efforts to defend world peace and immediately signed their names.

　　Mai Jianping and several other children from Shixing Primary School in Guangzhou organized a group and mobilized more than 700 people to sign in one day.

　　During the signature campaign in Guangzhou, an elderly gentleman named Lu He groped to the table with a child in his arms. He said: "The Japanese devils damaged my eyes when they occupied Guangzhou. I want to sign my name to oppose war."

　　Henan: After the peace signature campaign in Xuchang Special District was universally launched from the key areas of each county to the vast rural areas, with the high tide of the movement against American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea, the newly emancipated farmers in the rural areas enthusiastically signed the peace declaration, expressing their strong strength and determination. As of the middle of the month, 2,177,534 people in the entire special district had signed their names, accounting for 43% of the total population of the special district.

　　Before the signature campaign work penetrated into the rural areas, each county summarized the typical experience of the pilot townships and villages from June to early July, and analyzed and studied the current ideological situation of the masses. Then, through cadre meetings and principal and teacher meetings, they first organized them to study various documents on defending world peace, so that everyone could further understand the significance and purpose of the peace signature campaign. Then, they organized intellectuals, teachers, and students to form propaganda teams, which cooperated with the forces of farmer representatives in each district and township to carry out propaganda to the broad masses of farmers through mass meetings, small group discussions, field meetings, meal gatherings, and rooftop broadcasts, in conjunction with production and summer conscription work. During the propaganda process, due to the masses' increased political awareness, everyone unanimously and firmly expressed their willingness to support the liberation of Taiwan and the Korean people with practical actions and to fight for the defense of world peace when signing. For example, Chai Gaosheng and Lou Fuquan, farmers from Zhaoguan Village in Baofeng, said when signing: "We must cultivate the land well, produce more grain, and supply the People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan." The vast majority of the masses, in addition to enthusiastically participating in the signature campaign themselves, actively mobilized their families, relatives, and friends to participate. For example, Xu Yulan, a woman from Xiatang Village in Lushan, personally mobilized 27 people. Li Xueyu, a women's federation member from Gushi Township in Lin颍石桥 District, mobilized more than 80 women to participate in the signature campaign in one day. Farmers Jin Xuede and Dong Changshan mobilized 178 people to sign, and Zhang Baixuan, a primary school student, mobilized 432 people to sign. (Xing Dehua)

　　中国保卫世界和平运动线上
    广东北江专区地委于八月十五日向各县发出指示，要求各县在八、九月份进一步继续扩大和平签名运动，争取全北江区有一百万人参加和平签名。
    惠州海员工人陈全拿着斯德哥尔摩和平宣言书，走到每一条电船上去宣传解释，征求签名，又写信到家乡横沙村发动全村人签名，总计他一个人发动了六百三十余人签名。
    番禺县在七月下旬统计，全县已有十万人参加签名。该县一区有一万五千人签名。二区有一万三千余人。禺东区有一万二千余人。禺北区二万余人。三区一万一千人。一区一个农民说：“美帝像一只癫狗，一定会被人打死。”
    花县百分之八十的农会，百分之九十的小学校都已响应了反对侵略拥护和平的运动。单是赤坭乡第一小学所设的签名站，就有四千多人参加签名。总计全县已有二万二千余人参加了这一运动。
    三水县签名人数已达一万三千人。
    南海县已有五万九千余人参加签名。过去该县农民见面，习惯以“饮左茶未呀！”（广东话，意即喝过茶没有）打招呼，但现在以“你处开左农代会未？你参加左和平签名未呀？”来代替了。
    从石岐到澳门去的公路上也遍设了和平签名处。初从港澳回到自由新中国的侨胞，为祖国保卫世界和平的努力所激动，马上签上了名。
    广州始兴小学麦建平等几个小朋友组织一个小组，一天就动员了七百多人签了名。
    广州签名运动中，有一位卢赫老先生，抱着小孩摸到桌前，他说：“日本鬼占广州时把我眼睛弄坏了，我要签上名字反对战争。”
                                  （胡思升）
    河南  许昌专区的和平签名运动从各县重点地区向广大农村普遍展开后，随着反对美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜运动的高潮，各农村中新翻身的农民都踊跃的在和平宣言上签了名，表示他们坚强的力量与决心。截至月中为止，全专区已有二百一十七万七千五百三十四人签了名，占全专区总人口百分之四十三。
    在签名运动工作深入农村前，各县都总结了六月至七月初的重点乡、村实验的典型经验，分析研究了群众当前的思想情况。然后通过干部会议，校长教员会议，先组织他们学习保卫世界和平的各项文件，使大家进一步的认识和平签名运动的意义和目的，再由他们分别动员知识分子、教员和学生们组成宣传队，配合以各区、乡农代表力量，通过群众大会、小组座谈会、地头会、饭场会和屋顶广播等方式，结合生产与夏征工作，集体向广大农民群众展开宣传。在宣传过程中，由于群众对政治觉悟程度的提高，大家在签名时一致坚决表示要以实际行动来支援解放台湾和朝鲜人民，并为保卫世界和平而斗争。如宝丰赵官营农民柴高升、娄福全在签名时说：“我们要把地锄好，多打粮食，供给解放军解放台湾。”绝大部分的群众除了自己热烈的参加签名，更积极的动员他们的家属和亲戚邻友们都来参加签名。如鲁山下汤村妇女许玉兰亲自发动了二十七人。临颍石桥区固始乡妇联委员李学玉一天动员了八十多位妇女参加签名，农民金学德、董长山两人动员了一百七十八人签名，小学学生张柏轩一个人动员的签名人数已有四百三十二人。（邢德华）
