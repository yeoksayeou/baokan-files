Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 16th. The rent reduction movement in Guangxi Province has been implemented in more than half of the rural areas; with the continued victories in bandit suppression, the rent reduction movement is continuing to spread to the remaining rural areas. The rent reduction movement in Guangxi Province began in April this year in some rural areas in Guilin and other areas where banditry had been basically quelled. As of late July, the rent reduction work in the rural areas of Guilin and Ping Le prefectures in Guangxi's ten prefectures had come to an end one after another, and the central task in the rural areas had shifted to production and the clearing of scattered bandits. The rent reduction in Yu Lin and Wu Zhou prefectures will also come to an end. Some areas of the other six prefectures, including Nan Ning, have been carrying out rent reduction or are carrying out rent reduction in conjunction with production, while some areas are still suppressing bandits. According to provincial statistics, in more than half of the rural areas where rent reduction has been carried out, farmers have recovered 40 million catties of grain from landlords according to the rent reduction decree. This has greatly helped the vast number of farmers to overcome the difficulties of the spring and summer seasons when the old grain has been exhausted and the new grain is not yet available. Farmers' associations have developed greatly in the rent reduction movement, with the number of members in the province reaching 900,000. In the rural areas where rent reduction has been carried out, the rural political power in some villages has been transformed, the revolutionary order has been basically stabilized, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production is also increasing. According to incomplete statistics, the province has reclaimed 120,000 mu of wasteland this spring.

The awareness of the farmers who have undergone rent reduction has also been significantly improved. Many of them have spontaneously come forward to expose hidden bandits and launched struggles against local despots. Many young farmers have joined the militia to defend the victorious achievements of rent reduction and suppress the activities of bandits and special agents.

Due to the farmers' active demands for rent reduction after the victory in bandit suppression, and the fact that rural work cadres were trained in various places before the movement began, the development of the rent reduction movement in Guangxi has generally been relatively smooth. However, due to the shortage of cadres and lack of work experience, the organization of farmers' associations in some rural areas is impure. For example, in some villages in Xin Du County, the farmers' associations are controlled by landlords and ruffians, and the rent reduction has become a phenomenon of apparent reduction but actual non-reduction. In many areas, farmers' associations have exhibited "closed door" phenomena, excluding middle peasants. Errors of infringing upon middle peasants have also occurred in counties such as Lu Chuan and Lai Bin. In individual villages, incidents of beating and tying people have also occurred during the rent reduction movement. All of these have aroused the serious attention of the leading organs in various parts of Guangxi, some of which have been stopped, and some are being corrected.

　　广西减租运动正向全面开展
    减租地区农会发展农民积极生产
    部分地区农会不纯存在关门现象
    【新华社南宁十六日电】广西全省已经有一半以上的农村实行减租；减租运动随着剿匪的继续胜利，正向另一半地区的农村继续展开。广西省的减租运动，是今年四月间在桂林等地区匪患基本上已告肃清的部分农村中开始发动的。截至七月下旬，广西十个专区中，桂林、平乐两专区的农村减租工作，已先后告一段落，农村中心工作已转向生产和清剿散匪。郁林、梧州两专区的减租亦将告一段落。南宁等另六个专区部分地区已进行减租或结合生产正在进行减租，部分地区尚在剿除股匪。就全省统计，已进行减租的一半以上的农村，按减租法令，农民共收回地主多收的租粮四千万斤。这对于广大农民度过春夏两季青黄不接的困难作用很大。减租运动中农民协会有很大的发展，全省会员已达九十万人。已进行减租的农村，部分乡村政权已得到改造，革命秩序亦已基本稳定，农民生产情绪也正提高。据不完全统计，全省今春垦荒达十二万亩。
    经过减租的农民，觉悟也显著提高了。他们很多自动起来检举暗藏的土匪，并展开反恶霸斗争。青年农民多参加民兵，以保卫减租的胜利果实和镇压土匪特务的活动。
    由于剿匪胜利后农民积极要求减租，加以各地运动开始发动前均训练过农村工作干部，减租运动在广西的开展一般比较顺利。但因干部少而又缺乏工作经验，致部分地区乡村农民协会组织不纯。例如信都县有些乡的农民协会为地主流氓掌握，减租形成明减暗不减的现象。许多地区农会有关门排斥中农的现象，陆川、来宾等县还发生过侵犯中农的错误行为。个别乡村减租运动还发生过打人捆人的事。所有这些都已引起广西各地领导机关的严重注意，有的已经予以制止，有的正在进行纠正。
