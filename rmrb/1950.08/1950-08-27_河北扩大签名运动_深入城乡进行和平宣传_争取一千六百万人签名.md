[Our Newspaper's Report] Since the launch of the peace signature campaign in Hebei Province in late May, some achievements have been made in various places, but they have mostly remained in small and medium-sized towns, without timely penetration into the vast rural areas. In late June, the Hebei Branch of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace was established, which strengthened and unified the leadership of the province's peace signature campaign, and printed more than 300,000 copies of propaganda posters, leaflets, and maps. The Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China also printed more than 25,000 copies of propaganda manuals to help promote propaganda. In order to guide the peace signature campaign to unfold universally throughout the province in a timely manner, at the beginning of July, provincial-level organizations and educational departments, mainly the Great Peace Branch, extracted cadres to form the Hebei Province Peace Signature Campaign Propaganda Inspection Group, which went to various special districts and counties to conduct in-depth inspections of the development of the peace signature campaign, and at the same time assisted various places in carrying out key demonstrations, drawing experience, and promoting the whole province. Within a month, the leadership in various places realized that carrying out the peace signature campaign was an important political task and re-conducted discussions and research. Therefore, in many counties, in conjunction with the Party Congress, cadre meetings, and representative meetings of all circles held to arrange for the summer grain requisition, propaganda mobilization and calls for peace signatures were made, and Party members, cadres, and representatives actively participated in the signing. Many special districts and counties also dispatched cadres to form inspection groups to conduct in-depth inspections and assistance in districts and villages. Key cadres such as the county Party committee and the county magistrate of Linyu and other counties personally went to the district to provide specific guidance. In order to make the propaganda work more in-depth, some areas, such as Xingtai Town and Wu'an and other counties and towns, planned in advance to organize cadres to study and discuss relevant documents on publicizing the defense of world peace and opposing the American imperialist aggression, so that cadres first deeply understood the significance of defending world peace and opposing American imperialist aggression, and ideologically recognized that opposing aggressive wars and supporting world peace was the current struggle task of peace-loving people all over the world.

Thus, under the gradual and correct propaganda mobilization, the masses' political consciousness was effectively raised, and the peace signature campaign was universally launched throughout the province. As of recently, the number of signatures in the province has reached nearly five million. Now the peace signature campaign is continuing in conjunction with the movement to oppose the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea.

In this movement, various places generally grasped the characteristics of dispersion and backwardness in rural areas and the busy farming season, and used a variety of propaganda forms and different occasions, such as high-house broadcasting, blackboard newspaper answering questions, posting slogans and cartoons, parades and demonstrations, street market and temple fair propaganda, village cadres, teachers, or primary school students spreading propaganda from house to house, etc. Some villages in Xingtai County also used dining places, midday chat platforms, and masses' natural gathering places such as rest during lunch and evening cooling off to carry out propaganda mobilization, and the effect was very good. Some areas also paid attention to the ideological dynamics of the masses, and conducted specific propaganda explanations to address the doubts and concerns existing among the masses, and timely overcame the chaotic thinking of the masses. The peace signature campaign in Tangshan City has been carried out relatively well because they organized a large propaganda team, and the propaganda and mobilization work has been carried out relatively well. At the same time, they established 180 signature stations (also propaganda stations), and each propaganda station formed a propaganda network, and more than 20,000 workers, students, teachers, and staff of institutions formed 100 propaganda brigades. Through the calls of representative figures and the use of various propaganda tools, in-depth, extensive, and enthusiastic propaganda was carried out. In rural areas, more oral and literary propaganda methods were used, with Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, teachers, and members of various organizations as the backbone, and a considerable number of propaganda teams were organized to undertake the propaganda work, creating a true mass movement.

In terms of organizational work, various places first focused on conducting signatures among organized masses such as trade unions, Communist Youth League, women's federations, friendship associations, teachers, and students, and then mobilized cadres, Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists to give full play to their pioneering and leading roles and drive the broad masses to sign. For example, the secretary of the Communist Party of China branch in Da Li Village, Xiong County, heard the mobilization propaganda for peace signatures at a temple fair, and automatically launched propaganda when he returned to the village. He personally mobilized more than 70 people to sign. A student (member of the Communist Youth League) on summer vacation in Hetou Village, Fengnan County, conducted door-to-door signature mobilization, and mobilized more than 450 people to sign in 240 households. Wang Haiquan, a representative of the Hui people in Jixian County, not only publicized the significance of peace signatures from door to door and mobilized many Hui people to sign, but also sent a letter to Haomen Village in the Twelfth District, calling on them to sign the peace declaration as well. Experience has proved that as long as one is good at appropriately grasping and organizing backbone forces to mobilize activists among the masses, and use the masses to promote the masses, one can achieve great propaganda effects.

Now the provincial leading authorities and various people's organizations have issued a call to the people of the province, demanding that the people of the province make persistent efforts, continue to vigorously carry out the peace movement, deepen this movement into the vast masses of urban and rural areas, and strive to have 15 to 6 million people in the province sign the peace declaration in August and September. The county and prefectural committees have successively issued instructions calling for specific implementation of the instructions of the provincial Party committee and ensuring efforts to complete the task.

　　河北扩大签名运动
    深入城乡进行和平宣传
    争取一千六百万人签名
    【本报讯】河北省和平签名运动自五月下旬展开以来，在各地获得了若干成绩，可是大都停留在中小城镇中，没有及时深入广大农村。六月下旬，中国保卫世界和平大会委员会河北分会成立，使全省和平签名运动的领导得以加强和统一，并制印宣传画、传单、地图等三十余万份，中共省委宣传部也印发宣传手册二万五千余册。帮助推动宣传。为了及时指导和平签名运动在全省普遍展开，七月初省级各团体及宣教部门，以和大分会为主，抽出干部组成河北省和平签名运动宣传检查团，分赴各专区、县，深入检查和平签名运动开展的情形，同时并协助各地进行重点示范，吸取经验，推动全省。在一个月的时间内，各地领导上认识到开展和平签名运动是一项重要的政治任务，重新进行了讨论研究。于是在好多县份，结合着为布置夏征而召开的党代会、干部会、各界代表会议，做了和平签名的宣传动员和号召，党员、干部和代表们都踊跃的参加了签名。不少专区和县，也抽派干部组成检查组，深入区村进行检查协助。临榆等县县委、县长等主要干部，并亲自到区，具体指导。为了使宣传工作更加深入，有些地区，如邢台镇和武安等县镇，事先有计划的组织干部学习和讨论了宣传保卫世界和平，反对美帝侵略的有关文件，使干部首先深刻领会了保卫世界和平、反对美帝侵略的意义，从思想上认识了反对侵略战争拥护世界和平，是全世界爱好和平的人民当前的斗争任务。
    这样，在逐渐深入的正确的宣传动员之下，群众的政治觉悟有效地提高起来，和平签名运动也就在全省普遍展开了。截至最近，全省签名人数已近五百万人。现在和平签名运动结合了反对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜运动在继续进行中。
    在这一运动中，各地一般掌握了农村的分散落后的特点和农忙的季节，运用了多种多样的宣传形式和不同的场合，如高房广播、黑板报解答问题、张贴标语漫画、游行示威、街头集市和庙会宣传、村干、教员或小学生串家宣传等。邢台县有些村还利用了吃饭场、中午闲话台、和歇晌、晚间乘凉等群众自然聚会的场所，进行宣传动员，效果都很好。有些地区并注意了群众思想动态，针对群众中间存在着的怀疑与顾虑，进行了具体的宣传解释，及时克服了群众的混乱思想。唐山市的和平签名运动开展较好，就是因为他们组织了庞大的宣传队伍，宣传鼓动工作开展得较好。同时他们建立了一百八十处签名站（也是宣传站），由各宣传站组成了宣传网，由工人、学生、教员、机关人员等两万多人组成了一百个宣传大队。通过了有代表性的人物的号召，运用各种宣传工具，进行了深入广泛热烈的宣传。在农村则多用口头的、文艺的宣传方式，以党、团员、教员及各团体的会员为骨干，组织起相当数目的宣传队伍担负宣传工作，造成真正的群众运动。
    在组织工作方面，各地都首先着重于在工会、青年团、妇联、友协、教职员学生等有组织的群众中间进行签名，于是发动干部党员、团员、积极分子，使他们充分发挥先锋带头作用，带动广大群众签名。如雄县大李村中共支部书记，在庙会听到和平签名的动员宣传，回村就自动展开了宣传，他亲自发动了七十多人签名。丰南县河头村一个暑期休假的学生（青年团员），按户进行签名动员，在二百四十户中发动了四百五十多人签了名。蓟县县城回民代表王海泉，不仅挨门逐户的宣传和平签名的意义，动员了许多回民签名，并且还给十二区毫门村去信，号召他们也在和平宣言上签名。经验证明：只要善于适当掌握和组织骨干力量发动群众中的积极分子，以群众推动群众，就可收到很大的宣传效果。
    现在省的领导当局与各人民团体已向全省人民发出号召，要求全省人民再接再厉，继续大力开展和平运动，把这一运动深入到城乡广大群众中去，争取全省在八、九月份有一千五、六百万人在和平宣言上签名。各县地委已纷纷发出指示，号召具体执行省委指示，保证为完成任务而努力。 （河北日报、沧县地委会、蓟县县委宣传部、苗）
