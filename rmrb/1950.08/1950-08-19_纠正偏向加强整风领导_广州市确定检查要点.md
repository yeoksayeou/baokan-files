　　Correcting Deviations and Strengthening Rectification Leadership
    Guangzhou City Determines Key Inspection Points
    [From Our Newspaper] The rectification movement in Guangzhou's various agencies has moved from studying documents to inspection work. At the beginning of the inspection work, some deviations occurred: some focused on personal introspection, neglecting the inspection of current main tasks; some lacked key inspection points; some rectified subordinates before superiors; or both superiors and subordinates were rectified simultaneously. More seriously, some units did not follow the instructions of higher authorities but, based on the narrow experience of a few people, created their own set of rules. Some have not yet started the rectification movement. Some of these deviations have been partially corrected during the inspection process. The Guangzhou Municipal General Study Committee, in order to thoroughly correct these deviations, recently instructed all agencies to pay attention to: (1) The comrades in charge of leading the rectification movement in various agencies must deeply study the rectification instructions of the CCP Central Committee, the Central South Bureau, and the South China Sub-bureau, and the People's Daily editorial "Basic Links in Leading the Rectification Movement," and lead the rectification movement in accordance with the spirit of the instructions and the editorial. Absolutely no one is allowed to create their own set of rules. (2) The rectification should focus on the inspection of work. Relate personal introspection in the inspection and summary work. The following three points should be noted when inspecting work: (1) Is there a central focus in the work? (2) Are there any deviations in the implementation of policies? (3) What is the leadership style? The inspection method is a combination of top-down and bottom-up. Finally, a personal assessment is made. (3) While higher-level cadres are studying documents and conducting inspection work, lower-level cadres should simultaneously read the documents, conduct deliberation, and prepare to inspect the leadership. (4) Agencies that have not yet started the rectification movement should immediately conduct the rectification movement in conjunction with various work meetings.

　　纠正偏向加强整风领导
    广州市确定检查要点
    【本报讯】广州市各机关整风已从学习文件转入检查工作。在开始检查工作时，曾发生了一些偏差：有的着重个人反省，忽略了对当前主要工作的检查；有的缺乏检查重点；有的先整下后整上；或上下同时整。更严重的是：有的单位不按上级指示进行，而根据少数人的狭隘经验，自搞一套。有的至今尚未开始整风。这些偏差在检查工作过程中已有部分得到纠正。广州市级总学委会，为了彻底纠正这些偏差，特于最近指示各机关应注意：（一）各机关领导整风的负责同志，必须对中共中央及中南局、华南分局的整风指示，和人民日报“领导整风运动的基本环节”的社论，作深刻的研究，按照指示和社论的精神领导整风。绝不许自搞一套。（二）整风要以检查工作为主。在检查和总结工作中联系个人反省。在检查工作时要注意以下三点：（１）工作是否有中心？（２）执行政策有无偏差？（３）领导作风怎样？检查的方法是由上而下与由下而上相结合。最后作个人鉴定。（三）在上级干部进行学习文件检查工作时，下层干部同时要阅读文件，进行酝酿，准备检查领导。（四）尚未开始整风的机关，应立即结合各种工作会议进行整风。（广州市级总学委会通讯组）
