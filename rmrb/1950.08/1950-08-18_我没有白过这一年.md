　　I Haven't Lived This Year in Vain
　　Labor Model of Hengyang Railway Bureau Wang Yongxiang
　　I, Old Wang, will be seventy in a few months! I started working on the railway in my hometown of Tangshan when I was eighteen. At the age of thirty-three (1913), I transferred to work on the Yuehan Railway (which had just started construction at that time). For nearly forty years, the Yuehan Railway was repaired and destroyed, destroyed and repaired, time and time again. I, this old blacksmith, personally experienced this process. However, only one year after Changsha's liberation, the face of the Yuehan Railway has changed dramatically.
　　To say nothing else, thirty-eight large and small iron bridges of the Yuehan Railway were blown up by the White Fox (referring to the White Chongxi bandits) last year. If it had been under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the past, it would not have been repaired in three to five years. But the People's Government quickly repaired all these iron bridges. If I hadn't done it myself and seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe it myself!
　　Not only has the railway changed, but people have also changed! In the past, three days of work can now be done in just one day. A few days ago, the Engineering Section discovered that a staff member was embezzling and held a discussion meeting. Isn't it strange, no one scolded him, no one beat him, and he said everything one by one. He said he felt very uncomfortable and vowed never to make such a mistake again. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would never have believed it.
　　I have been an old blacksmith on the railway for fifty-two years. Speaking of the past fifty years, there are endless grievances to pour out. In 1933, I had nine months' salary deducted. My family ate everything we had. When I went to the bureau to ask for my salary, I was scolded. In 1944, my whole family fled to Dushan, Guizhou. We lost everything, not knowing where the next meal would come from. But who came to pity us? Just last year, the Kuomintang reactionaries gave us "Gold Yuan Bills," but a month's salary was only enough for ten days. Now prices are stable, and we don't have to worry about food and drink anymore.
　　In the past fifty years, no one looked up to us old workers. But after liberation, I saw that the chiefs and section chiefs worked as hard as we did, and my mind began to work. I worked hard. In January of this year, the whole bureau held a celebration meeting and selected me as a labor hero, giving me red flowers, medals, and award banners. What merit do I have to be a labor hero? It's all thanks to everyone's help.
　　This year, on "May Day" and "July 1st," I was again commended; on "July 7th," the whole bureau held its second celebration meeting and selected me as a labor model. What did I rely on to achieve such glory? Isn't it because we have the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
　　I often say to my comrades: You can see clearly in this year! Under the leadership of the Communist Party, working is the most glorious, and Chairman Mao likes diligent people the most. Work hard, and you will all become meritorious servants next year. You are young and strong, and your future is truly bright. They were happy to hear it. I have an old friend, sixty years old, and he wants to retire. I advised him, "If you don't work now, when will you work?" I, Old Wang, will not retire until I die.
　　In the past, when I taught apprentices, if the apprentice was lazy, I was too lazy to teach. I thought to myself: To hell with it, it's not going to hurt me, Wang Yongxiang! Now I know this is wrong. As long as I live, I must teach well every day. Teaching more apprentices is contributing more to the country. In this way, I can repay Chairman Mao.
　　If I could see Chairman Mao, I would definitely tell him: "I want to live another ten years! With you, we all have someone to rely on. I want to be able to see the prosperous and strong motherland in ten years, and I will die content. I, Old Wang, have not lived this year in vain!"

### 我没有白过这一年

　　我没有白过这一年
    衡阳铁路局劳动模范  王永祥
    我王老头差几个月就是七十岁啦！我十八岁就在老家唐山进铁路工作。三十三岁上（一九一三年），我转到粤汉铁路工作（那时该路刚开始动工）。近四十年来，粤汉铁路左一次、右一次的修复、破坏，破坏、修复。我这个老铁匠曾亲身经历了这个过程。可是，长沙解放才一年，粤汉铁路的面目就大大的改变了。
    不说别的，粤汉铁路大小铁桥三十八座在去年给白狐狸（指白崇禧匪徒）炸毁啦。要是在以前国民党反动派统治时代，三年五载都修不好。但人民政府就迅速地把这些铁桥统统修好了。要不是我亲手干过，亲眼看见，我自己都不肯相信！
    不说铁路变了样，就是人也变啦！过去三天的工作，现在只要一天就干完了。前几天，工务段发觉一个职员贪污，就开了个谈话会。你说怪不怪，既没人骂他，也没人打他，他一件件都说出来啦。他说着很难受，发誓以后再也不犯这种错误了。要不是我亲眼看见的话，我是怎么也不会相信的。
    我已是在铁路上干了五十二年的老铁匠了。提起过去那五十来年，真有吐不尽的苦水。一九三三年，我被扣过九个月的薪金，家里啥都吃光了，到局里要求发薪，还挨了一顿臭骂。一九四四年，我一家大小逃难到贵州独山，东西都丢光了，吃这餐不知下餐在那里。可是谁又来怜惜我们呢。就讲前年吧，国民党反动派发给我们“金元券”，但一个月的薪水只够十天用。现在物价平稳了，吃喝再不用愁。
    在过去的五十多年中，谁也瞧不起我们老工人，可是解放以后，我看见处长、段长们跟我们一样努力干工作，我的心眼开始灵活啦。我就拚命干。今年一月里全局开庆功大会，选我为劳动英雄，给我挂红花、佩奖章、赠给奖旗。我有啥功劳配做劳动英雄？还不是靠大家的帮助。
    今年“五一”、“七一”，我又评上了功；“七七”全局开第二次庆功大会，又选我为劳动模范。我凭啥取得这样的荣耀呢？还不是因为有了共产党和毛主席！
    我常常对同志们说：你们在这一年中可看清楚啦！在共产党领导下，干活是最光荣的，毛主席就最喜欢勤快人。好好干活吧，明年你们也都将成为功臣。你们年青有力气，前途真是光明远大。他们听了可乐啦。我有个老朋友，六十岁了，他要退休。我劝他说：“现在不干，啥时干？”我王老头是不到死就不退休的。
    过去我教徒弟时，徒弟懒，我就懒得教。心里想：管他的，又不是害了我王永祥！现在我晓得这是不对的。我活一天，就一定要好好教一天。多教会一个徒弟，就是对国家多贡献了一分力量。这样子，才能报答毛主席。
    假如我能看见毛主席，我一定要告诉他：“我还要再活十年！有了您我们就都有依靠了。我要能看到十年后的富强的祖国，死也甘心了。我王老头没有白过这一年！”
