Introduction to the Contents of "Sino-Soviet Friendship" Volume 2, Issue 4

The monthly magazine "Sino-Soviet Friendship," compiled and printed by the General Association of Sino-Soviet Friendship, was published on August 1st. To cooperate with the rectification movement of the entire Communist Party of China, this journal specially publishes the important lectures of Professor Askerov, one of the Soviet scholars who came to China to lecture in June and July at the invitation of the Association: "The Leninist-Stalinist Style in the Work of Soviet State Organs" and "The Staff of Soviet State Organs are Servants of the People," translated from the "Propagandist's Handbook" published in the Soviet Union, for readers' reference.

The Soviet academic circles launched a wide and enthusiastic discussion on linguistics in May and June. This is of great significance to the development of Marxist linguistics. This journal specifically translates and publishes Stalin's two immortal papers published in this discussion: "On Marxism in Linguistics" and "On Some Problems of Linguistics," as well as the "Pravda" editorial summarizing the discussion on linguistics: "The Transforming Role of Advanced Science," and specifically asks readers to pay attention to them.

Another central content of this issue of the journal is to introduce the development and achievements of Soviet plastic arts. Here are published Giselev and Kushelev's "New Works of Soviet Plastic Arts", Foucher Tichi's "Several Problems in the Development of Soviet Sculpture", Gerasimov's "Soviet Slogan Painting is an Important Means of Bolshevik Propaganda" and Povorotskaya's "Political Caricatures of Kukryniksy" and other four special articles and sixteen outstanding works of art for our country's plastic arts enthusiasts to study and observe.

In addition, there are important articles: "The Hope of Peace" (by Ehrenburg), "A Trip to China" (by Nurkin), "I Saw the Great Socialist Construction of the Soviet Union" (by Xu Xin), "Soviet Press on China" (by Li Yufu); Reference materials: "How the Soviet Army Annihilated the Japanese Bandits in Northeast China", "The Annihilation of Japanese Imperialism", "Soviet Air Force Day", "Zhdanov and Soviet Art" and cartoons, etc.
