　　Jilin Tax Bureau Summarizes Half-Year Work
    Exposes Bureaucratic Commandism, and Seriously Rectifies Cadres' Ideological Work Style
    [This newspaper's Jilin dispatch] In order to clarify policies, correct deviations, and meet the new tax revenue tasks for the second half of the year, the Jilin Provincial Tax Bureau, in addition to appropriately assessing the achievements of the first half of the year and rewarding cadres who were actively responsible, also exposed past shortcomings and deviations to draw the attention of cadres at all levels to correct them.
    Thanks to the correct leadership of superiors and the tireless and active work of all cadres day and night, the province's tax revenue work in the past six months has made remarkable achievements. In the first quarter alone, 30 cadres were awarded the glorious title of "Model Tax Worker," and 10 were awarded model medals by the Central Taxation Administration, becoming glorious banners for tax work and driving other positions to produce many activists and models. However, on the other hand, due to the existence of bureaucratic and commandist work styles in the work, the work could not achieve satisfactory results. The specific manifestations of these work styles are as follows:
    First, some leading cadres do not conduct in-depth inspections of work, do not conduct specific research, have arrangements but no summaries, do not humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and lack a democratic work style. For example, the director of the Dunhua County Bureau did not understand the situation himself and did not humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, resulting in improper commendations and criticisms, which affected the morale of cadres. When collecting business tax in January and February, they did not research or publicize, causing individual bad elements to take the opportunity to spread rumors and even instigate petitions; or take the opportunity to engage in embezzlement and bribery. For example, accountant Zhao Shuyi embezzled more than ten million Northeast currency. Some bureau directors have not even inspected outside offices for half a year, and even when they do inspect, they only make cursory observations and cannot discover problems. When tasks come, they only simply allocate numbers, without examining the specific situation, without giving instructions on methods, and without studying how to complete them. Even some materials are unreliable and untrue, and there are even statistics where the amount of income exceeds the turnover.
    Some bureaus also lack criticism and self-criticism, and maintain a state of harmony. They do not promptly educate cadres who are degenerating and corrupting; once it is discovered that it has become a fact, they can only punish them according to regulations, or dismiss them, or even hand them over to the law. In the past six months, four people have been sent to court.
    Second, due to the poor education from the leadership, some cadres ideologically believe that tax collection is about asking merchants for money, and take an antagonistic attitude towards merchants, with a serious commandist style. Instead of patiently educating those who violate regulations, they simply punish them or use punishment to threaten merchants.
    Some cadres are commendable for their enthusiasm, but they have failed to closely integrate with policies and have made the mistake of being impatient for quick results. For example, when convening democratic appraisal meetings, they are undemocratic and ask everyone to pass their own opinions. The selection of typical cases cannot represent the general, such as establishing many taxpayer groups within a few days and setting up various account books, but they are all unreliable and impractical.
    Some also fail to publicize and explain the political significance of paying taxes in tax collection work. For example, in Changchun City, a merchant asked a question. The city bureau and the tax office gave two different answers, leaving the merchant at a loss. There is also a kind of situation where they pretend to know what they do not know and answer casually, which affects the sales of goods.
    A few tax offices, because of poor political education, lead a lax life, which is equivalent to slacking off, creating disunity, causing trouble, and even engaging in embezzlement and corruption. The director of the Datun office in Changchun County does not discuss matters with everyone and does not care about the cadres. Zhang Mingshan of the Huashulinzi office in Huadian gambles with merchants; Xu Guang and Chang Chong of Jilin City collectively embezzle funds at the slaughterhouse. In Jiutai, Shulan, and Changchun, tens of millions of tax payments were lost due to lax systems and unclear responsibilities.
    The Provincial Tax Bureau has stated that these undesirable work styles must be treated with a serious attitude in the future.
    First, criticism and self-criticism will be carried out, with sincere self-examination from top to bottom and from bottom to top, using the attitude of treating illnesses and saving people, and being kind to others, to educate cadres to improve their work. The work will be done by unit of office, section, team and bureau to review and summarize the past, and at the same time research and plan the work for the third quarter, and specifically propose how to improve work methods under the principles of convenience for merchants and people, ease of management, and non-violation of laws and regulations.
    Second, symposiums will be held with public enterprises and merchants, or opinions will be solicited through people's representative conferences. Correct opinions must be humbly accepted, and incorrect ones must be patiently explained. The antagonistic attitude towards merchants must be changed, and opinions must be humbly solicited through the Federation of Industry and Commerce to strengthen ties with the masses. Merchants who actively make suggestions, promote work, and have a good attitude towards paying taxes should be commended and rewarded. It is also necessary to resolutely oppose the bad work style of personal retaliation.
    In addition, attention should be paid to commending and rewarding outstanding cadres who have consistently worked actively and have made achievements; those who repeatedly refuse to repent, refuse to examine themselves, do not seek progress, and seriously endanger the interests of the country and the people will be given due punishment.
    The Provincial Tax Bureau has also instructed all cities and counties to quickly report their summaries and specific plans for the third quarter, which will be formally planned after approval by the provincial government. (Zhao Zhao)

### 吉林税局总结半年工作  揭发官僚主义命令主义  认真整顿干部思想作风

　　吉林税局总结半年工作
    揭发官僚主义命令主义  认真整顿干部思想作风
    【本报吉林讯】吉林省税务局为明确政策，纠正偏向，迎接下半年新的税收任务，除对上半年工作成绩作适当估计，分别予积极负责的干部以奖励外，并对以往缺点偏向予以揭发，以引起各级干部注意纠正。
    该省半年来的税收工作，由于上级的正确领导及全体干部日夜不辞辛劳的积极工作，做出了显著的成绩。第一季度中即有三十名干部得了“模范税工”的光荣称号，并有十名荣获中央税务总局的模范奖章，成为税务工作的光荣旗帜，带动其他各岗位也涌现出不少积极分子和模范。但另一方面，由于工作中尚存在着官僚主义和命令主义作风，致使工作不能收到圆满效果。这些作风的具体表现有下面几点：
    首先是有些领导干部，对工作不深入检查，不具体研究，有布置无总结，不虚心听取群众意见，民主作风不够。如敦化县局长自己不了解情况，又不虚心倾听群众意见，结果表扬批评不当，影响了干部情绪。在征收一、二月份营业税时，不研究，不宣传，致使个别坏分子得乘机造谣，甚至鼓动请愿；或乘机营私舞弊。如会计赵树义即贪污东北币千余万元。还有的局长，竟有半年不到外所检查工作的，即检查也是走马观花，不能发现问题。任务来了只简单的分配数字，不考察具体情况，不指示办法，不研究如何完成。即使有些材料也不可靠、不真实，甚至有所得额超过营业额的统计。
    还有些局缺乏批评与自我批评，一团和气，平时对干部的堕落腐化不及时教育；一旦发现已成事实，只好根据规定处罚，或开除，以至法办。半年来送法院的已有四名。
    其次是一般干部由于领导方面的教育差，部分干部在思想上认为税收是向商人要钱，与商人采取对立的态度，强迫命令作风严重。对违章者不是耐心的教育，而是简单的处罚，或者用处罚来威胁商人。
    有的干部的热情可嘉，但未能紧密结合政策，犯了急于求成的急性病。例如召开民主评议会时不民主，要大家通过自己的意见。挑选典型不能代表一般，如几天之内便建立许多纳税小组，设有各种账簿，但是都不可靠，不切实际。
    还有的在税收工作中，不宣传解释纳税的政治意义。如长春市有商人问一个问题。市局和税所两样答复，使商人无所适从。还有一种是强不知以为知，随便答复，结果影响货物运销。
    还有少数税务所因为政治教育差，生活涣散，等于怠工，不团结、闹情绪，甚至贪污腐化。长春县大屯所长有事不和大家商量，不关心干部。桦甸桦树林子所张鸣山与商人赌钱；吉林市徐光、常冲在屠宰场集体贪污。九台、舒兰、长春均发生因制度不严，责任不明而丢失税款数千万的事件。
    对于这些不良作风，省税务局已提出今后必须以严肃的态度对待。
    首先进行批评与自我批评，自上而下、自下而上的虚心检讨，以治病救人、与人为善的态度，教育干部改进工作。并以所、科、股、局为单位，一面检讨总结过去，同时研究计划第三季度工作，并具体提出如何在便利商民，便于管理，不违犯法令的原则下，改善工作方法。
    其次，召开公营企业、商人座谈会，或通过人民代表会征求意见，对正确的意见，一定虚心接受，不正确的亦要耐心解释。改变和商人对立的态度，通过工商会虚心征求意见，加强和群众的联系，对积极建议、推动工作、纳税态度好的商人，应提出表扬和奖励。并要坚决反对个人报复的恶劣作风。
    此外，要注意表扬奖励一贯积极工作，有成绩的优秀干部；对屡教不改，不肯检讨，不求上进，严重危害国家人民利益的个别分子，予以应有的处分。
    该省税务局并已指示各市县迅速将总结及第三季具体计划上报，经省府批示后，即作正式计划。（赵昭）
