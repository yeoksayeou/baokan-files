    5. "Zhu De Locomotive" Challenge
    "Chief Driver, I heard that someone wants to challenge us?" Stoker Hu Chun Dong found Li Yong and said this.
    "Who said that?"
    "Everyone is saying it, don't you know?"
    It wasn't that Li Yong didn't know, he was just worried: If the challenge really comes, how should he respond? The people on the train are not of one mind.
    Sure enough, one day, the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" went into the depot for a B-level inspection (note 1), and the workers on the train were helping the machine room with the repairs. Old Saint Zheng Dugong hurriedly ran into the depot, holding a letter in his hand, and shouted loudly:
    "Old Shang! Old Shang!"
    When people heard this shout, they stopped what they were doing; as soon as they saw there was a letter, they immediately gathered around in a circle, chattering:
    "Quick, look, look!"
    "Could it really be here?"
    Old Shang listlessly took the letter, finished reading it, grinned, and stretched out his hand to the old hero and said:
    "Here, here, you’re just full and have nothing better to do!"
    This Old Shang is called Shang Baoheng. He's tall and thin, with a fair face and a slicked-back hairstyle. He's over thirty years old and attended senior primary school. He's the most educated person on the "Mao Zedong Locomotive". He's an old driver and drives beautifully: whether starting or stopping, you can't feel it at all on the train. If you put soup on the train, it's steady and doesn't even shake. When the passengers on the platform are lined up, he drives the train in so that the doors of each car line up with each row. Passengers don't have to squeeze or shout, and they can get on and off calmly.
    Everyone anxiously shouted:
    "What's wrong, Driver Shang? Why don't you say anything?"
    The old hero quickly took the letter, read it, and said:
    "It's really here, it's the challenge letter from the 'Zhu De Locomotive'." He then said to Shang Baoheng: "Old Shang, you're educated, read it aloud to everyone first, so everyone can hear it."
    Everyone urged Old Shang to read it quickly, but he was still slow.
    But he finally read the challenge letter:
    The letter was written in the name of Guo Shude, the special-class hero of the "Zhu De Locomotive". The general idea was: the "Zhu De Locomotive" was the first to implement the responsibility system in the Northeast, and now the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" has also implemented it, and the old hero Li Yong has become the chief driver again, so they want to have a friendly competition. The conditions of the competition are:
    First, not only be responsible for operating the train, but also be responsible for repairs and inspections, and truly achieve the three-responsibility system;
    Second, save coal and oil, and avoid any responsibility accidents;
    Third, gradually increase the daily train kilometers. ...
    Note 1: Every time a locomotive runs four or five thousand kilometers, it needs to have its boiler cleaned, and the running parts and steam chambers and cylinders inspected. This is called a B-level inspection. There are also A-level and C-level inspections. A B-level inspection takes two days.
    Note 2: "Da Che" (大车) is another name for the driver. (Attached picture)

    五、“朱德号”挑战
    “司机长，听说有人要跟咱们挑战哪？”司炉胡春东找到李永这么说。
    “谁说的？”
    “人们都在说，你还不知道？”
    李永不是不知道，他正发愁哩：真的要来了挑战，怎么回答人家呀？车上的人都不一条心。
    果然有一天，“毛泽东号”入库乙检（注一），车上工友正帮助机器房进行检修。老圣人郑笃恭急忙忙地跑进车库来，手里拿着一封信，大声喊：
    “老商！老商！”
    人们听了这一喊，都停了手里的活；一见有信，马上围上来一圈，七嘴八舌地说：
    “快看快看！”
    “莫非真来啦？”
    老商却不带劲地慢吞吞接过信，看完了把嘴一咧，伸手对老英雄说道：
    “给你给你，吃饱了胀的慌，没事找事哩！”
    这老商叫商宝恒。瘦高个子，白净脸，大分头。三十多岁，上过高小。“毛泽东号”顶数他文化高。是个老司机，开车漂亮：不管是开是停，叫你在车上一点也觉不出，汤水放在车上，稳稳的晃都不晃。站台上的旅客一行行站了队，他把车开进来，能叫每辆车的上下口都对准一行行。旅客不用挤不用嚷，从容地上下就是了。
    大伙儿着急地嚷道：
    “商大车（注二）怎么回事？你怎么不说呀？”
    老英雄赶紧接过信，看完说道：
    “当真来啦，是朱德号给咱们的挑战书。”又对商宝恒说道：“老商你文化高，先给大伙念一遍，让大伙听听。”
    大家催老商快念，他还是慢吞吞的。
    但到底他把挑战书念了一遍：
    信是“朱德号”机车的特等英雄郭树德出名写的，大概意思是：“朱德号”在东北是第一个实行负责制的，现在“毛泽东号”也实行了，老英雄李永又当了司机长，所以要来个友谊竞赛。竞赛条件是：
    第一、不光包乘，还要包修包检，真正做到三包负责制；
    第二、省煤省油，不出责任事故；
    第三、日车公里逐渐提高。……
    注一：机车每跑四、五千公里，需要清洗一次锅炉，走行部分和汽室汽缸等进行检修，这叫乙检。还有甲检丙检。乙检需要两天时间。
    注二：大车是司机的别称。（附图片）
