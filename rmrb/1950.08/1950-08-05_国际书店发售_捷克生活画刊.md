The Beijing International Bookstore, in addition to specializing in publications from the socialist Soviet Union, has recently ordered the English version of the medium-sized pictorial "Czech Life" from Czechoslovakia, in order to meet the needs of Chinese readers studying the economic and cultural construction of Eastern European New Democratic countries. The June 1950 issue (Volume 5, Issue 6) of the magazine has now arrived in Beijing. The content includes pictures and articles of the Czech people responding to the world peace movement, as well as "Self-Government in Prague," concerning Czech people's democratic politics, and multiple photographs of Czech industrial construction, such as "Types of Cars," with explanatory texts. The printing is very exquisite, and the basic price is 6.50 yuan per issue.
