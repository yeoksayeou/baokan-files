Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 10th: The United Nations Security Council continued its meeting on August 8th, chaired by Soviet Representative Malik, to discuss the Korean issue.

Due to the unreasonable obstruction of the US-British bloc, the Security Council meeting on the 8th failed to proceed with its original agenda and remained stuck on the debate of whether to invite representatives of the Korean people to participate in the meeting. On this issue, the Soviet Union's position is that the Security Council should invite representatives from both North and South Korea to participate in the meeting simultaneously in order to discuss and resolve the Korean issue fairly and reasonably. However, the US-British bloc unreasonably opposed inviting representatives of the Korean people and manipulated the majority to pass a resolution to forcibly adjourn the Security Council meeting and postpone it to the 10th.

Soviet Representative Malik, in his speech at the meeting, exposed the US representative's attempt to obstruct the Security Council meeting in order to orchestrate new procedural tricks. Malik also proposed a resolution to stop the barbaric bombing of Korea by the United States.

Before the meeting began, the Security Council received a telegram from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, protesting the brutal bombing of peaceful Korean residents by American planes and demanding that the Security Council take urgent measures to stop these crimes. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Malik first read out the aforementioned telegram. Then, Malik requested the Assistant Secretary-General to read out the second telegram from the United Nations Commission on Korea. However, at this time, Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu interrupted, saying that the representative of the Syngman Rhee authorities had not been invited to attend the meeting and asked Malik whether he believed he had an obligation to invite the South Korean representative to attend the meeting. Malik replied that Jiang Tingfu's conclusion was not yet mature. He pointed out that the Soviet representative had proposed on August 4th to invite representatives from both North and South Korea to attend the Security Council meeting, pending discussion by the Security Council. However, Norwegian representative Sunde and Jiang Tingfu continued to demand that Malik take a decision on Jiang Tingfu's statement on the manner in which the meeting would be conducted. Malik replied that the Chairman could not make a decision before the Security Council discussed the above proposal, and Malik announced that the debate on this issue had begun.

Malik then spoke in his capacity as the Soviet representative. He first put forward the previous Soviet proposal. Then, he pointed out that the United States had in the past invited the representative of the Syngman Rhee puppet to the Security Council meeting to present his views and had illegally passed resolutions based on these views. This was not a fair use of procedure and therefore violated not only the practice of the Security Council but also common sense. Malik said that in analyzing a disputed issue, the views of both sides must be heard, and no decision should be made based on unilateral statements. Malik reiterated the Soviet Union's demand that the Security Council hear the views of both sides of the dispute.

Austin then spoke, insisting that the Syngman Rhee clique represented all the Korean people and that North Korea ignored the United Nations resolutions. Malik, in refuting Austin's remarks, said that Syngman Rhee was not supported by the people at all, while the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had legitimate power. The illegal resolution on the Korean issue passed by the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 and the recent illegal resolutions of the Security Council were not binding on the Korean people because they violated Article 32 of the United Nations Charter by not allowing representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion. Malik also said that the US government's forcing the Security Council to take these one-sided decisions exposed its own fear of a public discussion of the Korean issue with the participation of representatives from both sides of the dispute. The United States wanted to prevent the representatives of the Korean people from participating, even ignoring the provisions in its own proposals that recognized the existence of the North Korean authorities. The United States feared the truth like fire, and it was not only satisfied with distorting the truth but also exerting open pressure on other countries in the Security Council.

British Representative Jebb supported the suggestions of the United States and the Kuomintang representative, advocating that the representative of the Syngman Rhee clique be invited to participate in the Security Council meeting immediately, and said that the Chairman of the Security Council could veto this suggestion if he wanted to do so. He also said that if Malik did not want to listen to this request, then he believed that there was no other way than to adjourn the meeting. Malik replied that the Chairman of the Security Council did not have the right of veto, and the Security Council could vote on whether the Security Council's resolution of June 25 inviting the South Korean representative was still valid.

Austin spoke, demanding that the Security Council immediately discuss the proposal submitted by the United States at the meeting on July 31. He unreasonably accused Malik of using his position as Chairman of the Security Council to obstruct the Security Council from passing the US proposal, and falsely accused North Korea of being the aggressor and the Soviet Union of helping North Korea to carry out aggression. Then, he proposed that the Security Council adjourn to August 10, insisting that this would allow the Soviet representative to have the opportunity to consult with Moscow, and that other members of the Council could also consult with each other in order to take measures to enable the Security Council (in his words) to fulfill its responsibilities under the Charter.

Malik, in his capacity as the Soviet representative, declared that it was Austin himself and his loyal servant, the Kuomintang representative, who were taking obstructive actions. They adopted this tactic because the ruling group in the United States did not want peace but wanted war and was now spending tens of billions of dollars on war preparations. The Soviet delegation was trying to formulate a solution so that both sides of the Korean War could present their cases to the Security Council. But who opposed such a solution? Who was taking obstructive tactics? It was the United States. American soldiers were trampling on the fields of Korea, and American pilots were bombing the Korean people, whose barbaric and brutal acts had been made very clear in the telegram from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Who was the aggressor and who was waging war in Korea? It was clear that the US government was the aggressor. The American representative's vague and high-sounding remarks could not hide the facts from world opinion.

Malik said that the Soviet delegation had received instructions to fight for the cause of peace, to fight for the maintenance of peace, for a fair discussion and resolution of the Korean issue. A fair discussion and resolution of the Korean issue must have the participation of both sides of the dispute and the participation of the representative of the People's Republic of China.

Malik said that the US delegation and its servants opposed this. The US delegation clearly needed time to orchestrate new procedural tricks, which it hoped to use to obscure the truth, to force other countries to submit to the will of the United States. It needed time to force its servants to accept its position and to force them to cast the votes that the United States wanted them to cast.

Malik opposed the US proposal to adjourn the Security Council to August 10 and argued that it should be reconvened on the 9th because the Democratic People's Republic of Korea had lodged a protest and demanded that urgent decisions be taken. Malik then read out the Soviet proposal entitled "Inhuman and Savage Bombing of Korean Civilians, Towns and Residential Areas by the US Air Force." The full text of the proposal is as follows:

"After studying the protest raised by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea against the inhuman and savage bombing of Korean civilians and peaceful towns and residential areas by the US Air Force, the Security Council believes that the US Air Force's bombing of Korean cities and villages, resulting in the destruction of these cities and villages and the mass slaughter of civilians, seriously violates recognized norms of international law. The Security Council therefore decides: to demand that the US government no longer continue to bomb urban residential areas or strafe peaceful Korean residents from the air with machine guns using the air force or any other means in the future. The Secretary-General of the United Nations is hereby urgently instructed to notify the US government of this decision."

Malik then put the adjournment motion to a vote. As a result of the US manipulation of the majority, the Security Council rejected the Soviet proposal and passed the US proposal, postponing the Korean issue, which needed urgent study, to August 10.

　　苏联代表马立克在安理会上提出提案
    要求制止美国在朝鲜的野蛮轰炸
    美国企图以阻挠安理会会议的进行布置新的诡计
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社纽约九日讯：联合国安全理事会于八日在苏联代表马立克主持下继续举行会议，讨论朝鲜问题。
    由于美英集团的无理阻挠，八日的安理会会议并未能进行原定议程，而始终停留在对会议应否邀请朝鲜人民代表参加的辩论上。在这个问题上，苏联的主张是：安理会应该同时邀请南北朝鲜双方的代表参加会议，以便公正合理地讨论并解决朝鲜问题。但是，美英集团却无理地反对邀请朝鲜人民的代表出席，他们并操纵多数通过决议，把安理会会议硬行休会，并延至十日再开。
    苏联代表马立克在会上的发言，揭露了美国代表企图以阻挠安理会会议的进行来布置新的程序上的诡计。马立克并提出了制止美国在朝鲜进行野蛮轰炸的提案。
    会议开始之前，安理会接到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的来电，抗议美国飞机对朝鲜和平居民的残暴轰炸，要求安理会采取紧急措施，制止这些罪行。在会议开始时，主席马立克首先宣读上述来电，接着，马立克又要求助理秘书长宣读联合国朝鲜委员会的二次来电。但是，在这个时候，国民党代表蒋廷黻却出而插言，说李承晚当局的代表没有被邀请与会，并询问马立克是否认为他有义务应邀请南朝鲜代表与会。马立克答称：蒋廷黻的结论尚未成熟。他指出苏联代表在八月四日即已提出邀请南北朝鲜双方代表出席安理会会议的建议，待安理会讨论。但是，挪威代表森德和蒋廷黻继续要求马立克对蒋廷黻就会议进行方式所作的发言采取决定。马立克答称：在安理会未讨论上项建议前，主席不能作出决定，马立克并宣布关于这一问题的辩论已经开始。
    马立克于是以苏联代表的地位发言。他首先提出苏联上次的建议。然后，他指出：美国过去把李承晚傀儡的代表请到安理会会议上来陈述意见，并使安理会根据这些意见非法地通过了决议。这不是公平地运用程序，因此，不仅违背了安理会的惯例，而且也违背了常识。马立克说，在分析一个争执的问题时，双方的意见都必须听取，而且决不可根据单方面的陈述作决定。马立克重申苏联要求安理会听取争端双方的意见。
    奥斯汀继起发言，他硬说李承晚集团代表全体朝鲜人民，并说北朝鲜忽视联合国的决议。马立克于驳斥奥斯汀的发言时说：李承晚丝毫不受人民拥护，而朝鲜民主主义人民共和国则具有合法权力。联合国大会于一九四七年关于朝鲜问题通过的非法决议与安理会最近的非法决议，对朝鲜人民没有约束力，因为它们违反联合国宪章第三十二条的规定，没有允许朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论。马立克又说：美国政府迫使安理会采取这些片面的决定，正是暴露了它自己害怕在争端双方代表参加之下公开讨论朝鲜问题。美国想不让朝鲜人民的代表参加，竟连自己提案中承认有北朝鲜当局存在的条文都置之不顾，美国像害怕火一样地害怕真理，而且它不仅以歪曲真理为满足，还对安理会其他国家施行公开的压力。
    英国代表杰伯支持美国和国民党代表的建议，主张立即邀请李承晚集团的代表参加安理会会议，并说，安理会主席可以否决这个建议，如果他想要这样作的话。他又说，如果马立克不想听从这个要求，那么，他认为除了休会以外就没有其他办法。马立克答称：安理会主席并没有否决权，安理会可以表决安理会在六月二十五日邀请南朝鲜代表的决议是否仍然有效。
    奥斯汀发言要求安理会立即讨论美国在七月三十一日会议上提出的提案。他无理地指责马立克利用安理会主席的地位来阻挠安理会通过美国提案，并诬指北朝鲜是侵略者和苏联帮助北朝鲜进行侵略。接着，他提议安理会休会到八月十日再开，硬说这样可以让苏联代表有机会与莫斯科商量，而其他理事国也可以彼此会商，以便采取措施来使安理会（用他的话来说）得以履行宪章所规定的职责。
    马立克以苏联代表资格宣称：采取阻挠行为的恰恰是奥斯汀自己及其忠实仆从——国民党代表。他们采取这种策略的理由，是因为美国统治集团不要和平而要战争，现在又正在花费数十亿美元从事战争准备。苏联代表团正想拟出一个解决办法，使朝鲜战争的双方都能够向安理会提出他们的案情。但是，是谁反对这样的一个解决办法呢？谁在采取阻挠策略呢？那就是美国。美国的兵士正在蹂躏朝鲜的田野，美国飞行员正在轰炸朝鲜的人民，其野蛮残暴的行为，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的来电已经说得很清楚。到底谁是侵略者，谁正在朝鲜进行着战争呢？很明显地，美国政府是侵略者。美国代表含糊其辞的高调，决不能在世界舆论面前掩盖事实。
    马立克说：苏联代表团已接到训令，为和平事业而战斗，为维护和平、为公正讨论及解决朝鲜问题而斗争。公正地讨论并解决朝鲜问题，必须有争端双方出席，也必须有中华人民共和国的代表参加。
    马立克说，美国代表团及其仆从们对此表示反对。美国代表团显然需要时间来布置新的程序上的诡计，他希望借这种诡计来蒙蔽真理，使别的国家服从美国的意志，它需要时间迫使它的仆从接受它的立场，强迫它们投美国希望投的票。
    马立克反对美国所提把安理会休会至十日再开的提案，而主张应在九日再开，因为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国已提出抗议，并要求采取紧急决定。马立克接着宣读了题为《美国空军对朝鲜平民、城镇和住宅区惨无人道的野蛮轰炸》的苏联提案。提案全文如下：
    “在研究了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所提的反对美国空军对朝鲜平民与和平城镇及居民区惨无人道的野蛮轰炸的抗议以后，安理会认为美国空军对朝鲜的城市和乡村的轰炸，使这些城市和乡村遭到毁灭、平民遭到集体屠杀的这种行为，严重地破坏了公认的国际公法条例。安理会因此决定：要求美国政府不再继续同时将来不准用空军或任何其他方式轰炸城市居民区或用机枪自空中扫射朝鲜和平居民。兹特紧急训令联合国秘书长将此一决定通知美国政府。”
    马立克然后把休会案提付表决，由于美国操纵多数的结果，安理会否决了苏联提案，而通过了美国提案，把需要紧急研究的朝鲜问题延至八月十日讨论。
