　　Mao Zedong Locomotive (Medium-Length Serial)
    By Ding Kexin, Qing Ying, Zhuang Yan
    8. Let’s Have a Meeting to Discuss

　　These past few days, the people at the locomotive depot would say to Shang Baoheng as soon as they saw him:
　　"Hey, Lao Shang, your Mao Zedong locomotive is really beautiful!"
　　"Hey, Lao Shang, you guys really put in some effort!"

　　Lao Shang felt good hearing this. But when he thought about how he hadn't properly participated in the scrubbing and renovation, he felt a bit ashamed. Plus, with the "Zhu De" locomotive challenging them, he was originally holding a grudge, determined to compete and see who was better. Because he didn’t want to participate in the cleaning, his energy was diverted. Now seeing everyone praising it, that energy was back.

　　But how to bring it up? The old hero had asked him two or three times to discuss the competition, but he had ignored him, making the old hero feel unwelcome. Now he had to go find him?

　　Ultimately, he couldn’t suppress his desire to win. One night after returning from a run, he found the old hero and said, pretending to be nonchalant:
　　"Hey, driver, there’s a problem."

　　Li Yong asked:
　　"What problem?"

　　Lao Shang said:
　　"It's not a big problem, but we need to study the operation method for going uphill on Yimianpo. Otherwise, we'll lose the competition and everyone will be embarrassed."

　　The old hero couldn't help but smile:
　　"That's right, I felt that way a long time ago. The old method of full water and full steam is no longer effective, we have to study it." Then he added, "I think the drivers should study it first."

　　Shang Baoheng tossed his long hair back and objected:
　　"Let's have a meeting instead, I'll explain it to everyone."

　　The old hero went along with him and said:
　　"Okay, okay, it would be even better if you explain it first."

　　He gathered the locomotive crew members (Note 1) in the rest room, sitting around the table, and started the meeting.

　　Li Yong had just announced that the meeting was to discuss the operating methods for going uphill and downhill when Zheng Dugong interrupted before he could finish:
　　"Full water, full steam, powerful as a tiger, who doesn't know that? Who came up with this fancy stuff to call a meeting?"

　　Shang Baoheng immediately interjected:
　　"Old sage, go stoke your fire, what do you know! When I was learning to drive, you were still kicking in your dad's thigh!"

　　Zheng Dugong was originally complaining that the old hero was just creating trouble with his fancy ideas, but he didn't expect Lao Shang to come at him like that, so he retorted:
　　"Who can compare to you, you slippery old fox!"

　　Shang Baoheng was about to say something again, but Hu Chundong quickly stopped him.

　　Sun Xiaobo raised the question:
　　"I heard about a new method for going uphill. Shuleijin (Note 2) tested it, where the water level in the boiler shouldn't exceed sixty percent. What's the deal with that?"

　　Shang Baoheng immediately stood up, rolled up his sleeves and said:
　　"That's not a problem, I've also tested it, it's most suitable that way."

　　Then he explained: maintaining sixty percent water is to prevent priming (Note 3). Don't put in too much water, leave some space for more steam, the power will be greater, and it will be easier to go uphill.

　　After talking about the boiler, he talked about the sand pipe (Note 4), saying:
　　"The sand pipe is also very important. You have to test whether the sand pipe is working before going uphill. Otherwise, if the sand pipe doesn't release sand, you're screwed when you start going uphill."

　　Everyone nodded as they listened. The old hero was even happier and followed up by saying:
　　"Big Driver Shang is right. Also, the driver and stoker have to pay attention and know things like the degree of the slope, the weather conditions, and the quality of the coal."

　　Shang Baoheng was impatient to listen to him and quickly interrupted:
　　"Right, right, that's how we'll do it, dismissed."

　　The old hero didn't stop him. As soon as Zheng Dugong heard "dismissed", he jumped up and shouted:
　　"Let's go!"

　　And the meeting really did break up.

　　Note 1: The staff who work with locomotives and trains are collectively referred to as crew members.
　　Note 2: Soviet advisor.
　　Note 3: Because the water is too full, the water is ejected with the steam, causing danger.
　　Note 4: Used for spreading sand to prevent slippery tracks. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号  （中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作  庄言
    八、开会研究研究
    这两天，机务段上的人们，一见商宝恒就说：
    “哈，老商，你们毛泽东号真漂亮！”
    “喂，老商，你们使劲不小啊！”
    老商听了也很痛快。但一想到自己没有好好的参加擦洗装修，又有点惭愧。再加“朱德号”来挑战，他本来蹩着一股劲，非比个高低不可。因为不乐意参加擦洗，把劲儿扯淡了。现在看看人人叫好，这股劲又上来了。
    可是怎么开口呢？老英雄两三次找他研究竞赛的事，他待理不理的，给了老英雄没趣，现在又要去找人家？
    到底压不住好强之心，一天晚上跑车回来，他找到老英雄，装着若无其事的样子说道：
    “哎，司机长，有问题啦。”
    李永就问：
    “有什么问题？”
    老商道：
    “问题不大，就是咱们跑一面坡，这上坡的操纵法得研究研究哩，要不，比赛输了大伙儿丢人。”
    老英雄禁不住笑道：
    “对，我也早觉着啦，水满汽足的老一套吃不开了，咱们得研究研究。”接着又说：“我看咱们司机先研究一下吧。”
    商宝恒把长头发向后一扑拢，反对道：
    “还是开个会，我给大伙儿讲一讲。”
    老英雄就顺着他说道：
    “好好，你先讲一讲就更好。”
    把机车乘务员（注一）们集合到休息室里，围着桌子，开起会来。
    李永刚宣布，开会是讨论上下坡行车操纵法，郑笃恭不等他说完就说道：
    “水满汽足，力大如虎，这一套谁不知道？谁出的花样又叫开会？”
    商宝恒马上接口道：
    “老圣人，烧你的火去吧，你懂个球！我学开车那时候，你还在你爹的大腿肚子里转筋哪！”
    郑笃恭原是埋怨老英雄净出花样找麻烦，不提防老商来这么一下，也就反骂道：
    “谁能比你这个又光又滑的老油呢！”
    商宝恒又要开口，胡春东急忙劝住。
    孙效伯就提出问题道：
    “听说上坡新方法，舒雷金（注二）试验过，锅炉的水不能超过百分之六十，到底是怎么回事？”
    商宝恒马上站起来，挽了挽袖子说：
    “这不算问题，我也试验过，这么着最合适。”
    下面他就解释：保持百分之六十的水，是为了防止汽水共腾（注三），水不要过多，留些地方多盛汽，力量就更大，上坡也容易。
    他讲了锅炉又讲沙子管（注四），说：
    “沙子管也很重要，上坡以前就得试验沙子管好不好，要不，沙子管不出沙，一上坡就抓瞎。”
    大家听了个个点头。老英雄更高兴，跟着说道：
    “商大车讲得都对。另外，比方坡度是多大，天气怎么样，煤好不好，司机司炉都得注意，都要知道。”
    商宝恒却不耐烦听他的，急忙插嘴道：
    “对，对，就这么办，散啦。”
    老英雄也没有阻止。郑笃恭一听说“散”，往起一蹦，嚷道：
    “走吧！”
    会也就真的散了。
    注一：随机车和列车的工作人员统称乘务员。
    注二：苏联顾问。
    注三：因水太满，水随蒸气喷出，发生危险。
    注四：撒沙用的，防止道滑。（附图片）
