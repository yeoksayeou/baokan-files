　　Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 28th: Since implementing the method of joint labor in November of last year, Qingdao Station on the Jiaoji Railway has reversed the past situation of frequent accidents and trains not running on time. From March to June of this year, the station has eliminated train accidents for four months, achieving 100% on-time train operation, and created a new record of an average of three hours and five minutes of stopping time per freight car, greatly improving the freight car turnover rate. The increased freight car turnover rate is of great benefit to the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and between domestic and foreign locations. Therefore, the station has received three awards from the Jinan Railway Bureau, totaling 6.6 million yuan in Renminbi. In June, it was also named a model station by the Qingdao Railway Sub-bureau.

　　Before implementing the method of joint labor, various departments of the station had serious problems of acting independently and not cooperating with each other, resulting in repeated accidents and trains not running on time. The average stopping time per freight car was delayed to 18 hours. The joint labor method implemented by the station involves the relevant units organizing a joint labor committee, proposing central tasks, and the daily shift handover meeting reviews and summarizes the day's work based on this center. In this way, the connection between the various departments has gradually become closer, the sense of responsibility of employees has been greatly strengthened, and the efficiency of work has also been improved accordingly.

　　青岛车站实行联合劳动
    事故消灭行车全部正点
    货车周转率提高促进物资交流
    受到济南路局三次奖励被评为典型车站
    【新华社青岛二十八日电】胶济铁路青岛车站自去年十一月实行联合劳动的办法以来，已扭转了过去事故多，列车不能正点的局面。从今年三月到六月的四个月中，该站已消灭了行车事故，使行车达到百分之百的正点，并创造了每辆货车平均停站三小时五分的新纪录，大大提高了货车的周转率。货车周转率的提高，对于城乡、内外物资的交流有很大裨益。因此，该站已受到济南路局的三次奖励，奖金共计人民币六百六十万元；六月份，并被青岛铁路分局评为典型车站。
    该站各部门在实行联合劳动的办法以前，曾有着各自为政、互相不能配合的严重现象，以致事故迭出，行车不能正点，每辆货车平均停站时间，曾延迟到十八小时。该站实行的联合劳动的办法是由有关单位组织联合劳动委员会，提出中心任务，每天的交班会议就根据这个中心检讨并总结一天的工作。这样一来，各部门间的联系便逐渐密切，职工的责任心也大为加强，工作效力也就随之提高。
