　　New Tang River Bridge Pier Washed Away
    Beijing-Hankou Direct Train Suspended
    Beijing Railway Sub-bureau Temporarily Adds One Beijing-Dezhou Train Daily
    [This newspaper dispatch] Due to a bridge pier of the New Tang River Bridge between Dingxian and Qingfengdian on the Beijing-Hankou Railway being damaged by flood, the Beijing-Hankou direct train has been temporarily suspended since the 4th. Over 200 railway employees and temporary workers from the Baoding Works Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau are currently working day and night to repair the bridge, throwing in rubble to protect the piers and erecting sleeper piles to temporarily replace the damaged pier. It is estimated that this temporary repair of the bridge will be completed by the 10th of this month. According to the person in charge of the Baoding Works Section, "If the flood does not rise further, the temporarily repaired New Tang River Bridge can maintain traffic." Therefore, the Beijing-Hankou direct train should be able to resume traffic within a few days. In addition, the lines north of Shijiazhuang at Dongchangshou and south of Shijiazhuang at Gaoyi and Anyang, which were broken by floods, have been repaired. The Beijing-Hankou line from Shijiazhuang south to Zhengzhou is open to traffic. In order to prevent future flood damage, railway employees from the Tianjin Railway Bureau and the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau are stepping up their work, unanimously taking flood prevention as the most important central task at present, so that the Beijing-Hankou Railway will not be interrupted again and the transportation task will be completed.
    [Another dispatch] Before the direct train on the Beijing-Hankou Railway resumes traffic, passengers and freight can still reach Hankou and Xi'an via the following routes: 1. From Beijing to Dezhou, from Dezhou to Shijiazhuang, and then from Shijiazhuang to Zhengzhou, Hankou, or Xi'an; 2. From Beijing to Xuzhou, from Xuzhou to Zhengzhou, Xi'an, or from Zhengzhou to Hankou. For the convenience of passengers, the Tianjin Railway Bureau has ordered the Beijing Railway Sub-bureau to temporarily add one train from Beijing to Dezhou from the 7th of this month, departing from Beijing at 11:00 a.m. daily.

　　新唐河桥墩被冲毁
    京汉直达列车暂停
    北京分局每日临时增开北京至德州列车一次
    【本报讯】京汉路定县与清风店间之新唐河桥的一座桥墩被洪水冲坏，京汉直达列车自四日起暂告停开。天津铁路局保定工务段二百余名铁路员工和临时雇工，现正日夜抢修该桥，抛投片石，卫护桥墩，并搭架枕木垛，暂时代替冲坏的桥墩。此项临时修复该桥的工程预计于本月十日完成。据保定工务段负责人谈：“如洪水不再上涨，临时修通的新唐河桥是可以维持行车的。”因此，京汉直达列车日内当可恢复通车。此外，该线石家庄以北之东长寿和石家庄以南之高邑、安阳等处被洪水冲断的线路，均已修复。京汉线石家庄以南至郑州线路已通车。为防止今后洪水为害，天津铁路局和郑州铁路局的铁路员工正加紧工作，一致以防洪为目前最主要的中心工作，使京汉路不再中断，完成运输任务。
    【又讯】在京汉路直达列车未恢复通车以前，旅客和货物运输仍可以由下面几条线路通达汉口和西安：一、从北京到德州，由德州至石家庄，再由石家庄到郑州、汉口或西安；二、从北京到徐州，由徐州至郑州、西安或由郑州到汉口。为了旅客的方便，天津铁路局已令北京分局，自本月七日起从北京到德州临时增加一次列车，每日上午十一时由北京开出。
