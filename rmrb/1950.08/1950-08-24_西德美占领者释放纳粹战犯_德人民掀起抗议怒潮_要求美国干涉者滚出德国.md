　　West German US Occupation Authorities Release Nazi War Criminals
    German People Launch Wave of Angry Protests
    Demand US Interventionists Get Out of Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 22nd] News: The United States occupying authorities in West Germany have recently released in batches important Nazi war criminals sentenced to long-term imprisonment in the Nuremberg trials. On the 16th and 17th alone, 20 war criminals were released. This has aroused a tide of angry protests among the German people.
    The Free German Trade Union Federation and the German Democratic Women's Federation sent telegrams to US President Truman on the 19th on behalf of the workers and women of Germany, lodging strong protests. The Free German Trade Union Federation pointed out in the telegram that the US release of Nazi war criminals is an act of utter inhumanity and open war preparation. Because, former Chief of the General Staff of Hitler, Guderian, stated in April during an interview with US Hearst newspaper reporter Weigand that one of the conditions for other Nazi generals to participate in the reorganization of West German armaments was the release of Nazi war criminals.
    The Free German Trade Union Federation declared: "All Nazi war criminals under US jurisdiction should be immediately extradited to the courts of democratic Germany." At the same time, "Because the United States violates the Potsdam Agreement, deliberately prepares for a third world war, and protects reactionary forces and persecutes democrats in West Germany, the US occupying authorities have proved that they no longer need to stay in Germany. For the sake of world peace and for the sake of all the German people, we demand of the American interventionists: 'Americans, go home!'"
    Trade unions in Brandenburg, the Brandenburg branch of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, the chairman of the Free German Youth League of Saxony, Harwick, and the mayor of Leipzig, Gillarach, have all protested against the US authorities' release of war criminals.

　　西德美占领者释放纳粹战犯
    德人民掀起抗议怒潮
    要求美国干涉者滚出德国
    【新华社二十二日讯】柏林消息：美国驻西德占领当局，最近曾成批释放在努连堡审判中被判长期徒刑的重要纳粹战犯，仅在十六、十七两日内，即已释出战犯二十名。此事已激起全德人民抗议的怒潮。
    自由德国工会联合会与德国民主妇女联合会于十九日分别代表全德工人妇女致电美国总统杜鲁门提出坚决抗议。自由德国工联在电报中指出：美国释放纳粹战犯，是丧尽人类天良和公开备战的行动。因为，前希特勒参谋总长古德林四月间在接见美国赫斯特系报记者维根德时曾声称：要使其他纳粹将领参与重整西德军备的条件之一，就是必须释放纳粹战犯。
    自由德国工联宣称：“一切在美国管辖下的纳粹战犯，应立即引渡与民主德国的法庭”。同时，“由于美国违反波茨坦协定、蓄意准备第三次大战和在西德保护反动力量并迫害民主人士，因此，美国占领当局证明了它自己已经无须留在德国。为世界和平计，为全德人民计，我们向美国干涉主义者要求：‘美国人，回家去！’”
    勃兰登堡州的工会，国际民主法律工作者协会勃兰登堡州支会，萨克森州的自由德国青年联盟主席哈威格和莱比锡市长吉尔拉赫等，对美国当局释放战犯事，均提出抗议。
