Repairing the Levee
    Guo Renzhi

    Review

    After dinner, Wang, the squad leader of the Sixth Squad, after finishing the Party group meeting, convened a squad meeting for everyone.

    Zhang Kecheng led off: "... Our squad broke a carrying pole and a shovel, that's because the tools weren't sturdy enough. Anyway, everyone is working hard enough, there's no problem completing the task."

    "I don't agree with Kecheng's opinion. If the tools aren't sturdy, why didn't the other squads break theirs? It's true that everyone is working hard. But relying on enthusiasm alone can't repair the levee; today was a good lesson. I say we committed impetuous adventurism; of course, I was one of them." Sun Qiang offered a different opinion.

    "Let me say something. Shovels are made of iron, and the other squads didn't break theirs, so why did I break mine! It's not that the shovel wasn't sturdy, it's that I have shortcomings. When I saw we couldn't keep up with everyone, I got anxious and was afraid of falling behind, and then I forgot to take care of the tools. Losing a shovel is like losing a gun in battle... I guarantee I'll overcome this shortcoming." Little Li continued with his self-criticism.

    Old Ma said: "I agree with everyone's opinions. Old Zhao said I'm a 'rash Zhang Fei', and I made that mistake again today. As soon as we started, I wanted to pile up the levee all at once; I wanted to load a cubic meter of soil into each basket, how could the carrying pole withstand that. Comrade Little Li is relatively weak, and he worked as hard as me, which is bound to lead to problems in the long run; but I didn't take that into account at the time."

    After everyone finished speaking, Squad Leader Wang said as if summarizing: "Everyone's spirit of self-criticism is very good. Everyone wanted a good start, but unexpectedly we had a bad start; I should take the main responsibility for this. Comrade Sun Qiang is right, enthusiasm alone is not enough, we committed impetuous adventurism today. The instructor said in the past: 'Willingness to work must be combined with technique.' I think we need to find a way to improve our technique."

    "Right! That's the way it is." Kecheng interjected: "When the comrades from the river affairs bureau gave us a lesson, didn't they say that we should dig the soil layer by layer, using one layer after another! What kind of digging were we doing, high in one place and low in another, and we had to go a long way to carry the soil, wasting effort without getting the job done."

    "I also have a suggestion: when we carry soil, we all face inward, and when we pick up the basket, we have to turn backwards one hundred and eighty degrees; if we face outward, we can pick it up and go, which is much more efficient!"

    "I propose that we reorganize ourselves well based on our physical condition and technical skills." As soon as Li Qingshui finished speaking, Ma Zhiyong immediately said: "Okay, Little Li and I will help each other, I guarantee that I won't let Little Li get too tired, and I'll also make sure not to damage the tools."

    "Kecheng and I!"

    "Qingshui and I!"

    "Squad leader, you and I!"

    "…………"

    Finally, Squad Leader Wang proposed that Little Li write down this lesson, the methods everyone thought of, and the guarantees for the future, on the one hand to introduce them to other squads to prevent them from taking detours again; on the other hand, to challenge other squads. The whole squad unanimously approved. At this time, the instructor came in.

    Squad Leader Wang briefly told the instructor about the squad meeting and sincerely asked him if he had any other opinions.

    "I'll just say one thing: everyone has a good spirit of work, but we must correctly recognize that production is long-term, and unnecessary impetuous shock work is not good. We must combine willingness to work with technique, and everyone should use their brains and do more research, not only to move soil quickly, but also to make the levee stronger."

    "Instructor, don't worry, we can guarantee that."

    "Okay, I'm counting on you! Today, the leadership of the company also has shortcomings. We focused on working and relaxed our leadership, and failed to conduct timely inspections. I also guarantee to overcome this, and I hope you will give the leadership more suggestions in the future."

    "Okay!" Everyone smiled slightly, and the instructor also smiled.

    检讨
    晚饭后，六班王班长开完党的小组会，就召集大家开班务会。
    张克成打头炮：“……咱班坏了一条扁担、一张锨，那是因为工具不结实。反正大家干的劲挺足，完成任务没问题。”
    “克成的意见我不同意。工具不结实，为什么别班没使坏呢？大家干得劲头足是真的。不过光凭一股热情不能把堤修起来，今天就是一个好教训。我说我们是犯了拼命主义；当然，我也是其中的一个。”孙强提出了不同的意见。
    “我说说。锨都是铁打的，别的班里没使坏，为什么偏偏我弄坏呢！不是锨不结实，是我有缺点。我一看供不上大家抬，着了急，又怕落了后，这一来就忘了爱护工具。少一张锨就像打仗时少了一枝枪，……我保证克服这个缺点。”小李接着作了检讨。
    老马说：“我同意大家的意见。老赵说我是‘猛张飞’，今天我又犯了这毛病。一开工，我就恨不得一下就把堤堆起来；一筐恨不得装上一方土，你想担子怎么能经得住呢。小李同志身体比较弱，拼命和我一样干，时间一长就得坏事；可是当时我没有照顾到这点。”
    等大家说完，王班长像作结论似的说：“大家的检讨精神很好。谁都希望来个开张大吉，不料来了个开张不利，这头分责任应由我来负。孙强同志说的对，光凭一股热情是不行的，咱们今天是犯了拼命主义。指导员过去说过：‘肯干要加上技术。’我看咱们得想法改进技术才行。”
    “对！是这么回事。”克成插嘴说：“河务局的同志给咱们上课时，不是说取土要一层一层的往下挖，使完一层再使一层吗！咱们挖的那算什么，高一块低一块，挑土时还得绕不少远道，费力气干不出活来。”
    “我也有点意见：咱们担土时都是脸朝里，担起筐来还得来一个一百八十度的向后转；假如脸朝外，担起来就走，多节约！”
    “我提议：咱们根据身体条件、技术好坏，再很好的组织一下。”李庆水刚说完，马志勇立刻说：“行，我和小李互助，我保证不让小李累坏了，还作到不损坏工具。”
    “我和克成！”
    “我和庆水！”
    “班长咱俩！”
    “…………”
    最后，王班长提议把这次的教训、大家想的办法和今后的保证叫小李写下，一方面介绍给别班，免得别班再走弯路；一方面向别班提出挑战。全班一致通过了。这时，指导员进来了。
    王班长把班务会的情形向指导员大略说了说，就诚恳地问他还有啥意见。
    “我就说一点：大家干的精神好，不过要正确的认识到生产是长期的，不必要的拼命突击是不好的。要肯干再加上技术，大家再动脑筋多研究，不光上土快，还要把堤打的更结实。”
    “指导员你放心，这个俺们敢保证。”
    “好，瞧你们的吧！今天连的领导上也有缺点。我们光顾了干活放松了领导，没作到及时检查。这个我也向你们保证克服，以后希望你们多给领导上提意见。”
    “行喽！”大家微微的笑了，指导员也笑了。
     （未完）
