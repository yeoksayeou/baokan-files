　　Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai Cables UN Secretary-General
    Denouncing the United Nations for Still Harboring the Illegal Representatives of the Remnant Bandits
    Notifying that I Have Appointed Representatives to Attend the Fifth UN General Assembly
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 26th] Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China sent a cable to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 26th, denouncing the United Nations for violating its charter and disregarding the just demands of the Chinese people by still harboring the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique in its various organs; and notified Lie that China has appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative to the Fifth UN General Assembly, and Li Yimang, Zhou Shidi, Ji Chaoding, and Meng Yongqian as representatives. The cable is as follows: Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lake Success, NewYork:

    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the Chinese people. The so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique are completely unqualified to participate in all UN meetings and its organs, and therefore must be expelled from all UN meetings and its organs. To this end, on November 15, 1949, I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, sent a note to you and Mr. Romulo, President of the Fourth UN General Assembly, stating that the so-called "Chinese Nationalist Government Delegation" headed by Jiang Tingfu has absolutely no right to represent China; on January 8, January 19, February 2, and May 30, 1950, I repeatedly sent notes to you and Mr. Romulo, demanding that the United Nations immediately expel the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique from the United Nations and its Security Council, Economic and Social Council, Trusteeship Council, and other organs, and notified you that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the People's Republic of China to UN meetings, including the Security Council, Ji Chaoding as the representative to the Economic and Social Council, and Meng Yongqian as the representative to the Trusteeship Council. However, to this day, the United Nations still harbors the illegal representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique in various organs of the United Nations, without immediately expelling them. I believe that this not only violates the United Nations Charter, but also disregards the just demands of the 475 million people of the People's Republic of China. Now that the Fifth UN General Assembly will be held on September 19, I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, hereby formally notify you: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the People's Republic of China to the Fifth UN General Assembly, and Li Yimang, Zhou Shidi, Ji Chaoding, and Meng Yongqian as representatives. Please forward this to all relevant parties and immediately process all procedures for the representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the Fifth UN General Assembly. I hereby inform you and request a prompt reply.

   Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
           August 26, 1950, in Beijing

　　周外长电联合国秘书长
    指斥联合国仍容留残匪非法代表
    通知我已任定代表出席五届联大
    【新华社二十六日讯】中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于二十六日致电联合国秘书长赖伊，指斥联合国违背宪章，漠视我国人民正义要求，竟仍容留国民党反动残余集团的非法代表在其各个机构之内；并通知赖氏我国任命张闻天为出席联合国第五届大会的首席代表，李一氓、周士第、冀朝鼎、孟用潜为代表。电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生：
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府。中国国民党反动残余集团的所谓“代表”完全没有参加联合国一切会议及其机构的资格，故必须将他们从联合国一切会议及其机构中驱逐出去。为此，我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府在一九四九年十一月十五日曾向阁下及联合国第四届大会主席罗慕洛先生发出照会，声明以蒋廷黻为首的所谓“中国国民政府代表团”已绝对无权代表中国；在一九五○年一月八日，一月十九日，二月二日，五月三十日，我又一再向阁下及罗慕洛先生发出照会，要求联合国立即将中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表从联合国及其安全理事会、经济暨社会理事会、托管理事会等机构中开除出去，并通知阁下，中华人民共和国中央人民政府已任命张闻天为中华人民共和国出席联合国会议，包括安全理事会的首席代表，冀朝鼎为出席经济暨社会理事会代表，孟用潜为出席托管理事会代表。但时至今日，联合国竟仍容留中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表在联合国各个机构之内，而不将其立即开除出去，我认为这不但违背了联合国宪章，而且漠视了中华人民共和国四万万七千五百万人民的正义要求。现在联合国第五届大会将于九月十九日召开，我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府特正式通知阁下：中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已任命张闻天为中华人民共和国出席联合国第五届大会的首席代表，李一氓、周士第、冀朝鼎、孟用潜为代表。请即转达有关各方，并即办理中华人民共和国代表出席联合国第五届大会之一切手续。专此奉达，请速电复。
   中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
           一九五○年八月二十六日于北京
