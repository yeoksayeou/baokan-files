　　Miyun County Security Captain Wang Yushan and Others Display Serious Warlordism;
    Local Party and Government Leading Organs Have Already Punished Them

　　Comrade Editor:

    Since entering the city, Wang Yushan, the security captain of Miyun County, Hebei Province, instructor Zhang Guisheng, and squad leader Ma Zhanrui (all Communist Party members), have been infected with the ideology of the ruling class of the old society and have shown serious warlord tendencies and corruption, and have been subjected to disciplinary action within the Party and administratively. Last November, two security team soldiers, Guo Chaosun, and barber Zhang Qi, returned home due to personal matters and did not return to the team on time. After the two of them returned, Wang Yushan and Zhang Guisheng did not carry out ideological education on them, but instead tied them up and hung them for two hours, and locked them in a cold room that night. According to soldier Zhu Qizeng, Wang Yushan, Zhang Guisheng, and Ma Zhanrui tied up and hung a total of eight soldiers last year. This serious warlord style caused great dissatisfaction among the soldiers.

    Wang Yushan and Zhang Guisheng also gave three large guns from the team to their relatives and friends for their use. For example, instructor Zhang Guisheng borrowed 300 jin of millet from Yu Zhenyi of Yanluo Village in the Seventh District and gave him a 38-type rifle and 50 rounds of ammunition as a reward.

    In addition, 4,498 jin of millet from the security team's production fund were also embezzled by Wang Yushan, Zhang Guisheng, and Ma Zhanrui.

    Under their warlord oppression, the soldiers dared to be angry but dared not speak out against their illegal acts. Last year, several soldiers from the team were transferred to work in Changping County and wrote to them with their opinions on their leadership style. However, this letter did not attract the attention of Wang Yushan and others, but instead they wrote back saying: "I have the right to eat and drink, a wolf travels a thousand miles to eat meat, a dog travels a thousand miles to eat excrement."

    Under such circumstances, the phenomenon of soldiers deserting occurred in the team. After the County Public Security Bureau sent personnel to investigate, the above series of problems were discovered. When squad leader Ma Zhanrui heard that these matters had been reported to the Public Security Bureau, he shot himself in the foot with a rifle in an attempt to reduce the punishment he deserved.

    The Miyun County People's Government has now removed Wang Yushan and the other three from their posts and sent them to the County People's Court for legal punishment. The County Party Committee's Discipline Inspection Committee also decided to place Wang Yushan and Zhang Guisheng on probation within the Party; Ma Zhanrui deliberately shot himself in the foot with a gun after his mistakes were exposed, so it was decided to expel him from the Party.

　　密云县保安队长王玉山等表现严重军阀主义作风
    当地党政领导机关已予处分
　　编者同志：
    河北省密云县保安队长王玉山、指导员张桂生、分队长马占瑞（都是中共党员），自从进入城市以来，沾染旧社会统治阶级的思想，表现了严重的军阀主义倾向，贪污腐化，已受到党内和行政上的处分。去年十一月，保安队战士郭朝顺、理发员张岐二人，因事回家，没按期归队。他们两人回来后，王玉山和张桂生等不是向他们进行思想教育，而竟将他们俩人捆起来吊了二小时，晚上又把他们关在冷屋子里。据战士祝其增谈，去年王玉山、张桂生、马占瑞三人共捆吊了八个战士。这种严重的军阀主义作风，引起战士们的极大不满。
    王玉山、张桂生又将本队的三支大枪送给自己的亲戚朋友使用。如指导员张桂生借了七区燕落村于振义小米三百斤，就送他三八大枪一支、子弹五十发作为报酬。
    此外，保安队的生产基金小米四千四百九十八斤，也被王玉山、张贵生、马占瑞三人贪污了。
    在他们军阀主义的压制下，战士们对他们的非法行为都敢怒而不敢言。去年该队几个战士调到昌平县去工作后，曾给他们来信，对他们的领导作风提出意见。但这封信并未引起王玉山等的注意，反而回信说：“老子吃吃喝喝有资格，狼行千里吃肉，狗行千里吃屎。”
    在这种情况下，该队就发生了战士逃亡的现象。经县公安局派员去了解后，才发现了以上一连串的问题。分队长马占瑞听说这些事已被公安局知道，就用步枪将自己的脚打伤，企图减轻其应得的惩罚。
    现密云县人民政府已将王玉山等三人撤职，并送县人民法院依法惩办。县委纪律检查委员会也决定给王玉山，张桂生以留党察看处分；马占瑞在他的错误被暴露后，还故意用枪把自己的脚打伤，故决定开除其党籍。
