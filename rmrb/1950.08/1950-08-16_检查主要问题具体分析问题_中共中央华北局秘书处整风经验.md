　　Examining Key Issues and Analyzing Problems Specifically
    Experiences from the Secretariat of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Rectification Movement

    [This report] The Secretariat of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau has the following experiences in its review work: First, many comrades are accustomed to personal reflections during their review work and are not good at starting from reviewing and summarizing their work. Therefore, the leadership must be good at insisting on starting from reviewing and summarizing work, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, improving work, and raising awareness, and opposing the practice of isolated ideological reviews that are detached from work. The leadership must pay attention to guiding this at all times, and also invite comrades who have done well in their reviews to give typical reports to inspire everyone to consciously start from reviewing their work and connect it with themselves. Second, review work should focus on key issues, that is, issues that are sufficient to reflect the characteristics of a department's work, have important policy significance, or are of a critical nature. Once the key issues are unfolded, secondary issues will also be resolved in connection. A general review is both laborious and cannot solve the problem. However, attention should also be paid to preventing and correcting the method of viewing problems one-sidedly and in isolation. Third, in review work, the problem must be raised specifically. When things are specific, right and wrong, responsibilities, and reasons will all be clear. The problem will also be easy to solve. However, some of our comrades are accustomed to talking empty words such as "there are shortcomings" and "thinking is wrong," some of whom may not see the problem; others are deliberately using empty words to perfunctorily shirk their responsibilities, and are unwilling to expose and correct their shortcomings and mistakes. In addition to the leadership paying attention to correcting this at any time, typical reports can also be used to help solve it. Fourth, review work must pay attention to the following four interrelated links: identifying problems, analyzing the situation, studying the reasons, and determining improvement measures.

　　检查主要问题具体分析问题
    中共中央华北局秘书处整风经验
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局秘书处在检查工作中，有以下几点体会：一、许多同志在检查工作中，是常常习惯于个人反省，不善于从检查总结工作着手。因此领导上必须善于坚持从检查总结工作，开展批评与自我批评，改善工作，提高思想，反对离开工作孤立检查思想的作风。这在领导上要时时注意引导外，还须请检查得法的同志作典型报告，启发大家自觉地从检查工作开始，联系个人。二、检查工作应检查主要问题，就是对于某些足以表现一个部门工作特点的，有重要政策意义的，或关键性质的问题。在主要问题展开后，次要问题也就联系解决了。那种泛泛检查是既费力气又不能解决问题。但也要注意防止和纠正片面地和孤立地看问题的方法。三、检查工作，一定要把问题提得具体。事情具体了，是非、责任、原因就都清楚了。问题也好解决了。可是我们有些同志是习惯于讲些“有缺点”“思想不对”等空话，其中有些可能是看不到问题；另有些是有意用空话敷衍塞责，而不愿揭发与纠正自己的缺点与错误。这除了领导上随时注意纠正外，也可用典型报告帮助解决。四、检查工作，必须注意以下四个相互关系的环节：找出问题，分析情况，研究原因，定出改进办法。
