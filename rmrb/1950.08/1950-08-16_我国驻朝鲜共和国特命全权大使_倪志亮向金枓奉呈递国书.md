　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th—General Ni Zhiliang, the first Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of our country to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, accompanied by Chai Junwu, First Secretary of the Embassy, Xue Zonghua, Second Secretary, Zhu Guang, Military Attache, Zhang Hengye, First Secretary, and Wu Xiaoda, Second Secretary, presented his credentials to Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, at 8:00 PM on August 13th. Present were Kang Ryang-uk, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, Park Dong-chu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cho Chong-hwa, Director of the Protocol Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Li Yu-seon, Acting Director of the China Department. When Ambassador Ni presented his credentials, he delivered an ode to Chairman Kim Tu-bong, and Chairman Kim Tu-bong gave a reply.
    Ambassador Ni's ode is as follows:
    Your Excellency Chairman:
    I am honored to present to you the letter of credence from the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China appointing me as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    Your Excellency Chairman, as I present my credentials to you, the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, with unparalleled heroism, are inflicting severe blows on the American imperialist aggressors and their lackey, the Li Seung-man puppet clique, and have achieved brilliant victories, liberating vast territories. Every one of your victories fills the Chinese people with excitement and encouragement. On behalf of the Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China and the entire Chinese people, I extend to you and the great, heroic Korean people warm congratulations and high respect. At the same time, I am deeply convinced that the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, will surely be able to completely smash the aggression and attacks of American imperialism and its lackey, the Li Seung-man puppet clique, and will surely achieve the complete liberation of the Korean people and their territory.
    Your Excellency Chairman, China and Korea have been brotherly countries since ancient times. The Chinese people and the Korean people are truly sharing weal and woe and sharing common interests in the great struggle for independence and liberation. Today, American imperialism is sending land, sea, and air forces to attack Korea, and at the same time, it is using armed intervention to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. Our two peoples' struggle against American imperialist aggression and for national independence and liberation is completely consistent. The unity, friendship, and cooperation between our two countries will not only further consolidate and develop the friendship that has existed between our two peoples for thousands of years, but will also help the common cause of the two peoples in their struggle for independence and liberation, and will help safeguard peace in Asia and the world.
    Your Excellency Chairman, I assure you that in my position as Ambassador of the People's Republic of China, I will do everything possible to consolidate and develop the unity, friendship, and cooperation between the Chinese people and the great Korean people. I hope that you, Your Excellency Chairman, will give me help and support in these efforts.
    Chairman Kim Tu-bong's reply is as follows:
    Your Excellency Ambassador:
    I am very pleased to accept the letter of credence appointing Your Excellency as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and I thank the Chairman and people of your country for their congratulations and encouragement to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army who are fighting against the aggression of American imperialism. I am deeply convinced that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, will certainly achieve greater achievements in the struggle to stop American imperialists from armed interference in Taiwan and to build a prosperous, independent, and autonomous country. Korea and China have historically maintained a brotherly and close relationship, and the goals and interests of the two peoples in their great struggle for the independence and liberation of their respective countries are consistent.
    Today, when American imperialists are openly carrying out armed aggression against Korea and are carrying out armed interference and various conspiracies to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, the goals of our two peoples in their struggle against the common enemy—American imperialists—for national independence and liberation are again consistent.
    The unity and friendly cooperation between Korea and China not only further strengthens and develops the friendship that has long existed between the two peoples, but also helps the common cause of the two peoples for independence and liberation, and at the same time is a strong guarantee for the victory of the liberation struggle of the oppressed nations of Asia, and makes a great contribution to the cause of safeguarding peace in the world.
    I warmly welcome Your Excellency to take office as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the People's Republic of China to Korea, and I am willing to do my best to assist you in strengthening and developing the friendship and goodwill between the peoples of Korea and China.
    I wish the people and government of your country infinite prosperity.

    我荣幸地向您呈递中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席任命我为驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国特命全权大使的国书。
    委员长阁下，当我向您呈递国书的时候，朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军正以无比的英勇精神，给予美帝国主义侵略者及其仆从李承晚傀儡集团以严重的打击，获得了辉煌的胜利，解放了广大的国土。你们每一个胜利，都使中国人民感到兴奋与鼓舞。兹特代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府主席和中国全体人民，向您和伟大的、英勇的朝鲜人民表示热烈的祝贺与崇高的敬意。同时，我深信，朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军在金日成将军的领导之下，一定能够彻底粉碎美帝国主义及其仆从李承晚傀儡集团的侵略与进攻，一定能够获致朝鲜人民及其领土的全部解放。
    委员长阁下，中国与朝鲜，自古以来，就是两个兄弟国家。中国人民与朝鲜人民，在争取独立与解放的伟大斗争中，真是休戚相关，利害与共。今天，美帝国主义出动陆、海、空军进攻朝鲜，同时，又正以武装干涉阻止中国人民解放台湾，我们两国人民反对美帝国主义侵略及争取民族独立解放的斗争是完全一致的。我们两个国家的团结、友好与合作，不仅将使数千年来存在于两国人民之间的友谊日益巩固与发展；而且，必将有助于两国人民，为独立与解放而斗争的共同事业，必将有助于保卫亚洲与世界的和平。
    委员长阁下，我向您保证，在我受任为中华人民共和国大使的职位上，我将尽一切可能致力于巩固与发展中国人民与伟大朝鲜人民之间的团结、友好与合作。我希望您，委员长阁下，在我这些努力中，给予帮助和支持。

    我很高兴地接受任命阁下为中华人民共和国驻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国特命全权大使的国书，感谢贵国政府主席及人民给予正在反对美帝国主义者的侵略而斗争中的朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军的祝贺与鼓励。我深信，中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下，在制止美帝国主义者武装干涉台湾、建设富强的自主独立国家的斗争中，一定有更伟大的成就。朝鲜与中国历来存在着兄弟般的亲密关系，两国人民为自己国家独立和解放的伟大斗争，其目标和利害关系是一致的。
    今天当美帝国主义者公开地武装侵略朝鲜并为阻止中国人民解放台湾而进行武装干涉和各种阴谋的时候，我们两国人民反对共同敌人——美帝国主义者争取民族独立解放的斗争，其目标又是一致的。
    朝中两国间的团结及友好合作，不仅愈益加强和发展了早已存在于两国人民间的友谊，并有助于两国人民为独立解放的共同事业，同时对于亚洲各国被压迫民族解放斗争的胜利是有力的保障，对全世界保卫和平的事业有莫大的贡献。
    我热烈地欢迎阁下出任中华人民共和国驻朝鲜特命全权大使，并愿对您加强和发展朝中两国人民间的友好与亲善的工作，竭力予以协助。
    谨祝贵国人民及贵国政府无限兴隆。
