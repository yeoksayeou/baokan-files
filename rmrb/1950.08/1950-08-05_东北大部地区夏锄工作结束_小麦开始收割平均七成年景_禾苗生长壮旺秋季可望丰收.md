[Reported by] Correspondents from various locations in Northeast China: Summer hoeing has largely concluded in most rural areas of Northeast China, and wheat harvesting has begun. In the South Manchuria region, summer hoeing and wheat harvesting will be fully completed within three to five days, shifting to activities such as manure accumulation. The season is later in the North Manchuria region, where a concentrated effort is now underway for the third round of cultivation and wheat harvesting, which is expected to conclude around August 10th.

This year, over 700,000 hectares of wheat fields were sown across Northeast China. Due to seed disinfection in most areas, coupled with farmers' deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, the average yield across the region is estimated at 70% of the potential. The Dalian-Lushun area has the best harvest this year, with an average yield of nearly five *shi* (approx. 750 kg) per hectare, exceeding last year's average yield of less than two *shi* (approx. 300 kg) by one and a half times.

In Suizhong, Xingcheng, Jinxi, Panshan, Tai'an, and other counties in the southern part of Liaoxi Province, hoeing ceased around July 15th. Counties in the central and northern parts of the province are currently focusing on the third round of hoeing. The harvesting of barley in the province was completed by mid-July, and wheat harvesting is also nearing completion.

Songjiang Province initiated summer hoeing the earliest this year, and its progress has been the most rapid. The original summer hoeing plan, which called for three cultivations and three weedings for stubble fields (sorghum, millet), two cultivations and two weedings for deducted fields (corn, soybeans), and two weedings for rice, has been largely completed. Areas that have completed the plan are striving to spend more time on additional cultivation, with 70% of the large fields in nine districts of Acheng County exceeding the planned weeding schedule; the Changling district of Hulan is conducting a fifth round of weeding. Wheat and flax in Songjiang have gradually matured and harvesting began on July 19th, now basically completed. Local cooperatives have also prepared for the purchase of wheat. Over 1,990,000 *mu* (approx. 132,667 ha) of wheat and more than 85,000 *mu* (approx. 5,667 ha) of flax in the province are growing well. However, due to insufficient seed disinfection, wheat in some areas has suffered from bunt disease, which may slightly reduce yields; however, wheat in areas where Soviet Ukrainian wheat seeds and other improved varieties were sown and where thorough seed disinfection was carried out has not been affected by the disease, or the impact has been minimal. Flax is a special crop in Songjiang Province, generally growing to more than two *chi* (approx. 67 cm) in height, and is expected to yield 9,450 tons of flax stalks and 1,930 tons of flaxseed. In addition, the province's 145,000 *mu* (approx. 9,667 ha) of sugar beets are expected to yield at least an average of one ton per *mu*.

Jilin Province is conducting intensive third-round cultivation of large fields and harvesting winter wheat. Shulan County is expected to complete cultivation by the end of July. Baiqi and other districts in the western part of the county ceased hoeing around July 20th, completing four cultivations and four weedings for deducted fields and four cultivations and five weedings for stubble fields. The Sun Shaoyan group in the Baiqi district of Shulan County, a key group of the Northeast Agricultural and Forestry Department's animal-drawn new agricultural implements, used various new agricultural implements for cultivation and weeding, which not only saved labor but also worked quickly. The group completed three rounds of cultivation by July 1st and finished four cultivations and five weedings by July 15th before ceasing hoeing. They began using harvesters to harvest wheat on July 20th. Due to the use of Soviet animal-drawn seeders and new technologies for sowing, as well as the selection and disinfection of seeds, the group's 2.2 *mu* (approx. 0.15 ha) of wheat had strong stalks and plump grains. After inspection, no black smut or disease was found. Compared to the Pang Guofan group, which used old agricultural implements and did not disinfect seeds, the group was able to harvest 1.5 *shi* (approx. 225 kg) more wheat per *mu*.

Heilongjiang Province plans to carry out three rounds of cultivation across the province this year, striving for an additional round and an extra *dou* of grain (approx. 10 kg). Qisheng Village in the third district of Hailun County completed the second round of cultivation by July 6th and is currently focusing on the third round. Zhongshan Village in the Baixiang district of the county completed three rounds of cultivation on its 534 *qing* (approx. 35.6 ha) of large fields on July 16th, and the fourth round has already begun.

To ensure increased production of grain and industrial raw materials, various regions in Northeast China have convened people's representative meetings to discuss and formulate summer hoeing plans in a timely manner. Furthermore, hoeing started earlier this year (generally ten days earlier than in previous years), providing ample time for careful and deep cultivation and multiple rounds of hoeing. Currently, autumn seedlings are growing exceptionally well: corn has already tasseled, with stalks taller than people; sorghum has already jointed, with some already heading; soybeans are generally flowering; rice has grown past the knee; and millet is also about to head. Lush and green crops foreshadow a good autumn harvest this year.

Many areas promptly turned over wheat stubble and planted autumn vegetables after harvesting wheat, and some applied manure to the harvested wheat fields. During the harvest, many areas paid more attention to seed selection. For example, Jilin has selected winter wheat seeds and will expand planting to 91,500 *qing* (approx. 6,100 ha) this year. In other areas, such as Panshan County, the masses were organized to conduct field selection and ear selection before the harvest, and wheat ears were harvested, pulled, threshed, and stored separately during harvesting, preparing sufficient wheat seeds and laying a solid foundation for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

　　东北大部地区夏锄工作结束
    小麦开始收割平均七成年景  禾苗生长壮旺秋季可望丰收
    【本报讯】综合东北各地通讯员报道：东北全区大部农村已陆续结束夏锄工作，开始收割小麦。南满地区的夏锄和麦收工作三、五日即可全部完成，转入积肥等活动。北满地区季节较晚，现正突击三遍铲趟，和开割小麦，至八月十日左右锄苗和麦收也可结束。
    今年东北全区播种麦田七十余万垧，因大部地区都经过种籽消毒，加上农民深耕细作，全区平均有七成年景。旅大地区今年收成最好，平均每垧产量近五石，超过去年平均产量不到两石的一倍半。
    辽西省南部绥中、兴城、锦西、盘山、台安等县，七月十五日前后即已挂锄；中部、北部各县，正突击锄三遍。该省大麦于七月中旬割完，小麦收割也已接近完成。
    松江省今年夏锄开始最早，进展也最为迅速。原订耲茬地（高粱、谷子）三铲三趟，扣茬地（苞米、大豆）两铲两趟，稻子薅草两遍的夏锄计划，现已基本完成。完成计划的地区正争取时间多铲多趟，阿城县九个区已有百分之七十的大田锄草超过计划；呼兰长岭区正进行五遍锄草。松江小麦和亚麻已经次第成熟，七月十九日起开始收割，现已基本结束。各地合作社并作好了收购小麦的准备工作。全省一百九十九万余亩小麦和八万五千多亩亚麻均生长良好。惟因麦种消毒工作做得不够普遍，部分地区小麦发生了腥黑穗病，可能略有减产；但种苏联乌克兰小麦种及其他优良品种和麦种消毒周密的地区，麦子则未受到病害影响或影响不大。亚麻为松江特产作物，一般都有二尺多高，估计可收麻茎九千四百五十吨，麻籽一千九百三十吨。另全省十四万五千多亩甜菜，估计每亩至少平均收成一吨以上。
    吉林省各县正紧张进行大田三遍铲趟和收割冬麦舒兰县全县七月底即可结束铲趟工作，西部白旗等区二十日前后即已挂锄，做到扣茬地四铲四趟，耲茬地四铲五趟。东北农林部马拉新农具重点组——舒兰县白旗区孙绍岩组，使用各式新农具进行铲趟，不但省工，而且干得快，七月一日结束三遍铲趟，十五日完成了四铲五趟后挂锄，二十日起使用收割机收割小麦。该组二垧二亩小麦，由于使用了苏联马拉播种机和运用新技术播种，种籽又经过挑选和消毒，因而麦棵粗壮、籽粒饱满，经过检查，没有一棵发生黑穗和病象。比使用旧农具未消毒的庞国范组每亩小麦能多收一石五斗。
    黑龙江省全省大田今年计划做到三遍铲趟，并争取多铲趟一遍，多打一斗粮食。海伦县三区七个村七月六日即铲趟完二遍，现正突击三遍。该县百祥区忠善村五百三十四垧大田，七月十六日完成三遍铲趟，第四遍也已开始。
    为保证增产粮食和工业原料，东北各地均曾召开人民代表会议，及时讨论与拟订了夏锄计划。并且今年开锄早（一般比往年早十天），因而有充裕时间进行细铲深趟和多铲多趟。现各地秋苗生长异常良好：玉茭已经出蓼，秆子比人高，高粱均已拔节，有的已经出穗，大豆普遍开花，稻子已长过膝，谷子也快出穗。肥美葱绿的庄稼，预示着今年将有一个好秋收。
    不少地区在收割完小麦之后及时翻麦茬、种秋菜，有的在拔完的麦地上了大粪。在收割中不少地区更注意了选种。如吉林已选好冬麦种籽，今年扩大播种九万一千五百垧。其他如盘山县在开割前即组织群众进行地选、穗选，收割时又将麦穗单割、单拉、单打、单存，准备好足量的小麦种籽，打好明年小麦丰收的基础。（丁铿、牛复盛、崔载权、金养变、刘仁和、傅文成、张志正、杨士珍、杨东明、刘继勋、东北日报、黑龙江日报、吉林日报、辽西省人民政府农林厅）
