　　Worker Yao Sheng near Daiyue on the North Tongpu Line Rescues Train

　　On August 6th, Yao Sheng, a track maintenance worker from the Heyangbao Engineering Section of the Daiyue Engineering Department on the North Tongpu Line, was inspecting the tracks in the rain between Daiyue and Yulin. At 96 kilometers and 700 meters, he discovered that a mountain flood had washed away a 12-meter-long, 7-meter-deep hole in the roadbed, with floodwaters raging under the rails. If not rescued in time, it would have caused a major train derailment accident. At this time, Train 271, which had departed from Daiyue, was about to arrive. Local militiamen, hearing the great force of the water, also ran to protect the road. Comrade Yao Sheng asked the militiamen to be responsible for guarding this section of the washed-out roadbed. He then ran to meet the train. The rainwater beside the railway had accumulated into a river, and he slipped several times, his whole body covered in mud, but he still quickened his pace and ran forward. After about 20 minutes, he met the train. He waved a stop signal while shouting loudly to stop the train. This prevented the train from derailing and overturning, protecting the safety of passengers' lives and property. The train driver, Wu Liangwen, shook Comrade Yao Sheng's hand tightly and said, "If you hadn't discovered the roadbed that had been washed away by the water, this entire train would have been finished." The passengers also gave Comrade Yao Sheng grateful cheers.

　　After the train returned to Daiyue, the conductor reported the flood situation and the estimated repair time to the passengers. Passengers who had money immediately bought all the food on the train. But the passengers who didn't have money panicked. Head Conductor Wang Fengtong and Public Security Squad Leader Zhao Ying immediately convened a meeting of the crew to figure out a solution. They decided to pool their money to buy some millet and borrow the local Public Security Bureau's pots and stoves to solve the eating difficulties of the passengers without money. After the meeting, Comrades Wang Fengtong and Zhao Ying braved the heavy rain and contacted the local Public Security Bureau to buy eight liters of millet and two liters of mung beans, and cooked a large pot of porridge for the passengers without money. They not only carried the porridge to the train in buckets, but also scooped it into bowls and delivered it to the passengers' hands. In this way, the eating problem of 62 passengers without money was solved. Passenger Liu Zhao suffered from abdominal pain and vomiting, and train attendant Wang Zuyu immediately found medicine and borrowed a quilt for him. The passengers expressed their infinite gratitude to the track inspector Comrade Yao Sheng and the crew members of the train for their spirit of being conscientious and responsible for ensuring traffic safety, mutual assistance, friendship, and wholeheartedly serving the people.

　　北同蒲线岱岳附近工人姚生抢救火车
    八月六日，北同蒲岱岳工务段河杨堡工区养路工姚生在岱岳、榆林间冒雨查道，查到九十六公里七百公尺处，发现山洪把路基冲穿了长十二公尺、深七公尺的一个大洞，洪水在钢轨下面汹涌奔流。如不及时抢救，就会酿成列车颠覆的重大事故。此时由岱岳开来的二七一次列车即将开来。当地民兵听见水势浩大，也跑来护路。姚生同志就请民兵们负责看管这段冲坏了的路基。他便跑去迎车。铁道旁边的雨水积成河，他曾滑倒数次，全身滚满了泥水，仍加速脚步，向前奔跑，约过二十分钟，便迎上了火车。他一面挥动停车信号，一面大声喊叫停车。这样使该次列车避免脱轨颠覆的危险，保护了旅客生命财产的安全。该列车司机武良文紧握着姚生同志的手说：“要不是你查出被水冲毁的路基，这列车全都完啦。”旅客们也齐向姚生同志发出感激的欢笑。
    当列车退回岱岳后，列车员把水害情形及预定修复时间报告给旅客后，带钱的旅客们立即把车内的食品买光。但没有带钱的旅客们发了慌。客运车长王凤桐、公安班长赵英马上召集乘务员开会想办法，决定凑钱买一些小米，借当地公安局的锅灶，给无钱的旅客解决吃饭困难。会后，王凤桐、赵英两同志冒着大雨与当地公安局取得联系买到八升小米、二升绿豆，给没钱的旅客们熬了一大锅粥。他们不但把粥用水桶抬到车上，还盛在碗里送到旅客的手里。如此便解决了六十二位无钱旅客的吃饭问题。旅客刘钊得了腹痛呕吐病，列车员王祖毓立即给他找药借被子。旅客们对巡道工姚生同志及该次列车的乘务员们这种认真负责保证行车安全与互助友爱的高度为人民服务的精神，表示无限感激。
