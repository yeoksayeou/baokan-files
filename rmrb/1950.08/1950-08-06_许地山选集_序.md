　　Preface to "Selected Works of Xu Dishan"
    Yang Gang
    Editor's note: The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government is currently compiling selected works of new literature writers since the May Fourth Movement, under the general title "New Literature Series." "Selected Works of Xu Dishan" is one of them. This series has not yet been published.
  I
    As far as I have seen, Mr. Xu Dishan left behind only four short story collections: "Empty Mountain Spirit Rain," "The Spider Weaving Its Web," "Briefs from a Precarious Nest," and "The Liberator." Among them, the contents collected in the two books, "The Liberator" and "Briefs from a Precarious Nest," are almost identical. Therefore, what I have actually seen can only be said to be three short story collections.
    From these three booklets, I have selected sixteen pieces as listed in the table of contents of this book (note). The order is roughly intended to show the author's evolving ideological content from fantasy to reality. In reality, this is of course impossible to fully achieve. Because an author who is basically starting from fantasy, their realistic writing is often a product of the intertwining of reality and fantasy. Moreover, Mr. Dishan unfortunately died midway in his development, making it impossible for him to fully experience and understand the Chinese people's great revolutionary struggle and its creative victory process in reality.
    I am not very familiar with Mr. Dishan's history and cannot fully cite and explain the emotions and ideological content he expresses in his works from the perspective of his life and personality. Just the period from 1940 to 1941 when I was in contact with Mr. Xu in Hong Kong made me feel that these short sixteen pieces were really insufficient to explain the progress of this author. During that period, Mr. Dishan showed a very strong courage in practical action and a spirit of self-struggle. This is not easily seen from this selection.
  II
    The basic spirit of the May Fourth Movement was to fight for science and democracy. Under this solemn and fundamentally scientific slogan, various forms of romanticism also arose, launching a major attack on traditional etiquette and the Confucian ideology of governing the family, ruling the country, and bringing peace to the world. There were elements of individual heroism and romantic decadence. There were also people who were unwilling to make far-reaching reforms to revive the era, and unwilling to follow the Confucian tradition, placing themselves in an established system and drifting along. This latter thought was almost naturalistic and anarchistic. It can be said that Mr. Dishan was one of them. He acknowledged that society and life had weaknesses, but he was unwilling to investigate the root causes of these weaknesses, treating them as natural, unorganized, and unregulated existences, believing that basically nothing could be done about them. He recognized that he should be active and beneficial to people, but he was unwilling to make any demands on himself, making himself subject to the constraints of the crowd. Ideologically, he negated the existing society, but in reality, he compromised. He accepted existing things, only willing to do some patching and repairing work. He believed that the meaning of each person's life lies in their ability to pick up the leftovers and fill the gaps, in their ability to meet the deficiencies and pick up the remains anytime, anywhere, without having to ask about the consequences. He believed that he could create his own destiny from this, and also make nature run from this.
    Mr. Dishan's romanticism with this sense of fatalism was determined on the one hand by his petty-bourgeois status and on the other hand by the influence of Buddhist philosophy. People who have not studied Buddhist philosophy cannot carefully trace the clues of his thoughts and attitudes. Generally speaking, Buddhism regards being alive as suffering and Nirvana as the main theme of Mahayana. I think Mr. Dishan agreed with this, at least in his early days. Eliminating form and attaining the perfect realm of pure bliss should be the purpose of life for him. However, at the same time, he lived in reality and possessed a deep and simple love for his country, for the people around him, especially for his wife. This prevented him from settling for that philosophy of pure bliss. According to the Buddhist view of life, he acknowledged that life is a torn garment, an extremely fragile spider web, "There is no unbroken web in the world" ("The Spider Weaving Its Web"). Moreover, he could not choose the shape and color of this broken web. Because no matter how he chooses, its essence is nothing more than "dozens of colorful glass beads transformed into various forms" (ibid.), just as a torn garment is nothing more than scraps of silk and cloth patched together. However, he did not therefore become a monk and return to Nirvana. He wanted to brave the rain and wind to mend the torn garment. He wanted to make women maintain purity and handle their broken lives with astonishing tranquility and autonomy, just like spiders mending broken webs. Although he was sometimes fascinated by Nirvana, causing Minming and Jialing in "The Bird of Life" to join hands and walk into Green Ripple Lake; sometimes, out of love for his deceased wife, he was willing to sit on her grave for years and days holding a six-stringed zither ("After Dusk"); but he still wanted to "make a dry poplar bloom," allowing the old woman who had drifted to a foreign land and was lonely and helpless to meet her childhood lover at the age of seventy.
    Mr. Dishan's early romanticism was basically unhealthy. Through this form of romanticism, he conveyed the content of compromise. From an ideological point of view, he did not grasp the deep patriotic feelings and love for people he expressed in "After Dusk," and even later in "The Gills of the Iron Fish," to fundamentally negate the view that life is extremely bitter and that life is a broken spider web, thereby defining his relationship to the surrounding reality. He wavered between reality and fantasy, sometimes attempting to escape ("After Dusk"), sometimes attempting to solve real problems with subjective fantasies ("A Withered Poplar Sprouting"). This state of mind could not but lead to his fundamental compromise with and acceptance of the existing status quo. In fact, this was exactly what he showed at Yenching University for a period.
  III
    What prevented him from going in a bad direction from here was his populism and humanitarianism.
    When encountering Mr. Dishan's later works, this populist and humanitarian thought is very obvious, and at the same time, the romantic and fantastical elements gradually fade, and the realistic elements gradually strengthen in his novels. However, this does not mean that Mr. Dishan's populism did not exist in his early works. "Empty Mountain Spirit Rain" is such an ethereal and unfounded book, almost entirely fantasy. But here there is such a very simple "Peanut." He loved peanuts, he touted peanuts, he even called himself a "peanut." We have heard many intellectuals talk about populism to make a special embellishment for their arrogant heroism. But for Xu Dishan, peanutism was a love, an indelible feeling. Why? Because:
    "No matter who can buy it at a cheap price to eat; everyone likes to eat it, that's its advantage." ("Peanut") Moreover, therefore, everyone should learn from peanuts "to be a useful person, not a great and decent person." (ibid.)
    Based on this love, almost all of his novels that are closer to reality choose their protagonists from among the general working people. And when members of the exploiting class appear in his pen, they are often objects of malicious satire and mockery.
    It can be said that his ideal character is Chun Tao in "Chun Tao." This garbage-collecting woman is naturally also a person who seriously mends the broken web of life. She married her husband, but on the second day of their honeymoon, her husband was arrested by the "catch the men" soldiers. She herself was also driven out of her hometown by the warlord war. She fled, she probably also begged for food, she worked as a servant, and finally she had to carry a basket and go inside and outside Beijing every day to collect waste paper to exchange for "lamp money." In such a life, according to human needs, regardless of what the etiquette that governs people is, she absorbed a fellow villager as a boyfriend, and the two lived on the same kang "like a pair of sparrows." The two spent all day studying how to get the old official documents pulled out of the palace in order to sell a little more. At this time, Chun Tao met her old husband again, who had also had both legs broken and was begging for food. She sympathized with him, brought him home, the three made trouble, then reconciled, the boyfriend became the "head of the household," the old husband became a cohabitant, and the three united to live and work completely according to the mutual respect and mutual love of the working people.
    This novel can be said to be a rare realistic work in Mr. Dishan's works. Even in form, there is no legendary element in many of the author's novels. The pure and autonomous qualities of the working people and the noble class sympathy are fully expressed here. At the same time, he did not neglect their hardship in the struggle of life, their "blind and dull sorrow" and "straightforward joy." It can be said that Mr. Dishan, based on his peanut-style emotional content, had a fairly deep understanding and love for the simple working people. However, due to the limitations of his life, it was impossible for him to focus on class relations, so that Chun Tao's independent, bright, honest, strong, and receptive character and the life experiences surrounding this character could be contrasted and made more sculpted and purposeful through the contradictions and struggles of different class relations. His populism limited him, although "Chun Tao" is precisely the achievement of his populism.
    Mr. Dishan's populism and his humanitarianism are inseparable. In his few twenty-two or three works with realistic elements, there are four based on a humanitarian standpoint to express the arduous fate of the working people. In all four articles, he was angry and protested against this hateful and abhorrent so-called fate. I have selected three here. In "The Eye of the Law," he protested against the so-called law for the unjust death of a gardener, pointing out the phenomenon of class antagonism where "those who steal a hook are punished, those who steal a country become princes." In "The Way Home," he wrote about the desperate death of a maid and the tragic criminal behavior that occurred around her. In "Briefs from a Precarious Nest," he even directly cursed some unscrupulous and life-threatening behaviors. His starting point was humanitarianism, and his position was to sympathize with the oppressed people. But precisely because he was unable to go beyond this starting point and the general populist standpoint, he could not understand that the so-called "eye of the law" is not the people's eye of the law, therefore, it cannot see the people's reason and the people's reality. His "The Way Home" is even more of a cry without a target, becoming a blind and helpless anger. The legendary nature of these two things originally damaged the reality of the class society they represented, and his petty-bourgeois vague humanitarianism plus his philosophy that life is a broken spider web further deprived them of their due power. These are all uncarved jade in Mr. Dishan's works, because the author's life and his thoughts failed to be tempered by the broad people's movement in time. He had deep sympathy for the general people, but he held suspicion and avoided the people's movement and struggle because of his philosophy. He basically could not understand his society, and he was also at a loss about the past and future of his country, even pessimistic. He just tried hard to rely on his sympathy for the oppressed people from populism and the sense of justice from humanitarianism to support himself, even forcing himself to get closer to reality day by day. He was very painful, sometimes very confused to approach the reality that he originally did not want to approach. His efforts were not in vain. The War of Resistance helped him take a big step. At this time, he abandoned the study of Buddhist scriptures, did not write much, but tried his best to participate in the actual actions of national liberation and worked hard for the people. But just as he was taking this step, his life stopped.
        IV
    China's cultural history of the past thirty years was produced in a wasteland full of sand, stones, and violent wind, thunder, and rain. On the one hand, this wasteland of old culture did not accumulate much fertile soil from its feudal past, and on the other hand, the ideas and practices of capitalist society, which came to China along with the imperialist cannons, played a great disruptive role in China and could not find a place to take root in China to grow a set of Chinese bourgeois culture. Therefore, China's cultural history of the past thirty years must inevitably follow the Chinese people's liberation struggle and become a battle history that is fought very fiercely, very bravely, and finally wins the victory of the people's culture. One by one, the giants facing the battle first separated from and rebelled against their class through hard struggles against the reactionaries and themselves, and returned to the people, belonging to the proletariat. We have Mr. Lu Xun, Mr. Tao Xingzhi, and Mr. Wen Yiduo, as well as many people who are now working diligently in the people's cause.
    In this great historical movement, Mr. Dishan died prematurely and out of time. He died in Hong Kong before the outbreak of the Pacific War. This, whether for the cause of the Chinese people's culture or for himself, should be said to be a loss, because he died while developing in a better direction.
    1939 to 1941 was a period when the cultural struggle in Hong Kong was very high. The organization and education work unfolded around the Hong Kong branch of the All-China Anti-Enemy Association of Literary and Art Circles became a central force in uniting, encouraging, and improving the fighting courage, knowledge, and confidence of the young people who had fled to Hong Kong. At that time, there were four or five youth groups around the Literary Association, and more than a dozen supplements and other publications were published under the overall spiritual encouragement of the Literary Association. Mr. Dishan was in charge of the Hong Kong Literary Association at that time. Mr. Dishan participated in almost all of these tasks except when he was sick. From presiding over speeches at mass rallies to secretly giving tutoring classes to a few seventeen- or eighteen-year-old refugee youths in small broken buildings in Sham Shui Po at night, he never refused to go. There was no publication that he thought was too small to write articles for. At this time, the Hong Kong overseas branch of the Kuomintang bandit gang, on the one hand, put pressure on him, asking him to go out to hold meetings for them to make a scene, and on the other hand, spread rumors about him, saying that he was flattering the Communist Party and wanted to show off. He did not therefore compromise with them, wavering his enthusiasm for standing on the side of the Literary Association and doing practical work. Comparing this period of his with his period of studying Buddhist scriptures behind closed doors at Yenching, complaining that the Chinese nation was not progressing, his progress and development are almost miraculously impressive. The War of Resistance exposed the crimes and corruption of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and gradually showed that only the Communist Party was truly resisting Japan and truly serving the people. Mr. Dishan, like many honest and simple intellectuals, was beginning to understand and hoped to accept this truth at the risk of his life. He died at this time, wouldn't it be a great misfortune!
    Although he died out of time, making the road for him to break away from petty-bourgeois romanticism, populism, and humanitarianism to return to the people and belong to the proletariat unable to reach its due destination. However, his determination to take this road can be seen from his continuous efforts in Hong Kong for more than two years in the early days of the War of Resistance. From the fact that he put aside Buddhist scriptures, even put aside the old Chinese literature he taught at the University of Hong Kong, and ran up and down the mountains and ran through the bustling cities of Hong Kong and Kowloon every day, participating in activities in the ranks of the people, it should be said that his thinking began a stage of transformation, which was an upward development of his populism and humanitarianism. This change, this development, is almost the same as what Wen Yiduo experienced. Therefore, his road is basically no different from Mr. Wen's road. He is a proud, upright, and blooded son of the Chinese nation.

    (Note) The sixteen pieces are: "The Spider Weaving Its Web," "The Old Woman Mending Broken Clothes," "The Bird of Life," "After Dusk," "A Withered Poplar Sprouting," "Wish," "Peanut," "Merchant Woman," "Chun Tao," "The Gills of the Iron Fish," "Reading 'Gardenia and Jasmine' and Thinking of My Grandmother," "Justice Prevails," "The Eye of the Law," "The Way Home," "In Premier Fei's Living Room," and "Briefs from a Precarious Nest."

### “许地山选集”序

　　“许地山选集”序
    杨刚
    编者按：中央人民政府文化部现正编纂五四以来新文学作家的选集，总名为《新文学丛书》。《许地山选集》即是其中之一。这个丛书现在还没有出版。
  一
    许地山先生留下来的文艺作品据我所见到的只有四本短篇集子：《空山灵雨》、《缀网劳蛛》、《危巢坠简》和《解放者》。在其中，《解放者》和《危巢坠简》两本书所收集的篇目几乎完全相同。因此，我所见到的实际上只能说是三本短篇选集。
    从这三本小册子里，我选择了如本书目录所举的十六篇（注）。其顺序大致上是希望能显出作者从空想走到现实的一个有发展性的思想内容。实际上这当然是不可能完全做到的。因为一个基本上是从空想出发的作者，其现实性的写作时常也是现实与空想交织的产品，而地山先生在其发展的过程中又不幸死在中途，使他不能够充分地经历和认识中国人民伟大的革命斗争及其创造现实的胜利过程。
    我对于地山先生的历史不大熟悉，不可能充分地从他的生活与为人方面来引证并说明他在作品中所表现的感情和思想内容。仅仅从一九四○——一九四一我在香港与许先生所接触的那一段，就已经使我觉得这短短十六篇东西实在不足以说明这位作者的进度。在那一段时期中，地山先生所表现的对实际行动的勇气和进行自我斗争的精神非常强烈。这，从这本选集里不很容易看出来。
  二
    “五四”运动的基本精神是为了科学与民主而斗争。在这一个庄严的、基本上是科学的口号之下，同时也兴起了各种形式的浪漫主义，向传统的礼教观点和儒家的齐家治国平天下的一套封建思想大施攻击。这里面有个人英雄主义的成份，有浪漫颓废的成份。也有人既不愿对时代作起死回生的远大改革，又不肯跟着儒家传统，将自己摆在一套既成的体系里面随波逐流。这后一种思想几乎是自然主义的和无政府主义的。可以说地山先生也是其中之一。他承认社会及人生有弱点，却不肯追究弱点的根源，而把它们视为自然的无组织无规律的存在，认为基本上对之无可为。他认识自己应该是积极的有益于人的，而不愿向自己作什么要求，使自己承受人群的约束。从思想上，他否定了既存社会，但是在实际上他妥协了。他接受既存的东西，自己只愿作一些补缺拾遗的工作。他认为每一个人的生命意义就在于他能拾遗补缺，就在于他能够随时随地遇缺即补，遇遗即拾，也不必问其后果。他认为他可以由此而创造自己的命运，也由此而使自然运行。
    地山先生的这种带着定命论的浪漫主义，一方面是他的小资产阶级身份所决定，另一方面是受佛教哲学的影响。对佛教哲学没有研究的人不能够仔细地追踪他这种思想和态度的线索。一般地说，佛教以有生为苦恼，以涅槃为大乘的主旨，我想地山先生是赞成的，至少在其早期是如此。消灭色相，达于清净极乐的完美之境，在他应该是生命的目的。不过，同时他生活于现实之中，对于他的国家，对于他周围的人，特别是对于他的妻子，富有一种深沉朴实的爱情，这使他不能安于那种清净极乐的哲学思想。依着佛教的人生观，他承认生活是一件破衣服，是极易残破的蛛网，“世间没有一个不破的网”（《缀网劳蛛》）。并且这种破网的形状和颜色他也不能选择。因为无论如何选择，它的本质总不过是“几十颗彩屑琉璃幻成种种”（同书），正如一件破衣服无非是零剪绸头布屑补缀起来的。但是，他却并不因此就去出家，归向涅槃。他要不顾雨丝风片去补那破衣服。他要使女人尚洁以惊人的宁静自主来处理她那破碎的生活，好像蜘蛛补缀破网一样。虽然他有时能为涅槃所迷，而使《命命鸟》中的敏明和加陵携手走进绿漪湖中去；有时候，为了对于死去的妻子的爱恋，他情愿抱着六弦琴长年长日坐在他的坟上（《黄昏后》）；可是他还要“枯杨生花”，让那漂泊异乡，孤苦无依的老婆子在七十岁时碰到她少时的爱人。
    地山先生这种早期的浪漫主义基本上是不健康的。经过这种浪漫主义的形式，他传达了妥协主义的内容。从思想方面来说，他没有把握他自己在《黄昏后》乃至于后来在《铁鱼的鳃》里面所表现的深沉的爱国感情和对人的爱情来从根本上否定所谓生是极苦，生命是破蛛网的观点，从而确定自己对于周围现实的关系。他徘徊于现实和空想之间，有时企图逃避（《黄昏后》），有时企图以主观幻想来解决现实的问题（《枯杨生稊》）。这种思想状态不能不产生他对既存现状根本的妥协和承认的态度。事实上他在燕京大学一个时期所表现的也正是如此。
  三
    使他不至于从这里朝坏的方向走的因素是他的平民主义和人道主义。
    接触到地山先生较后期的作品时，这种平民主义和人道主义的思想甚为明显，同时浪漫的、空想的成份也逐渐褪色，而现实的成份在他的小说里也渐渐加强。但是，这并不说明地山先生的平民主义在他早期的作品中不存在。《空山灵雨》是那样一本缥缈无端的书，几几乎完全是幻想。但是在这里却有这么一篇十分朴实的《落花生》。他爱落花生，他标榜落花生，他甚至把自己叫做是“落花生”。我们曾经听到不少知识分子谈平民化，来为他们的自高自大的英雄主义作一种不凡的点缀。可是许地山的落花生主义对他是一种爱好，一种不可磨灭的感情。为什么？因为：
    “无论何等人都可以用贱价买他来吃；都喜欢吃他，这就是他的好处。”（《落花生》）而且，因此人都应该学落花生“要做有用的人，不要做伟大体面的人。”（同上）
    本着这种爱好，他的全部较接近现实的小说几乎都是在一般的劳动人民之中选择主角。而属于剥削阶层的分子在他的笔下出现时，经常是恶意讽刺嘲骂的对象。
    可以说他的理想人物是《春桃》中的春桃。这一个拾垃圾的女人自然也是为了生活的破网而一本正经地加以补缀的人。他嫁了丈夫，可是新婚刚刚第二天，丈夫就被抓夫抓走了。他自己也被军阀战争赶出了家乡。她逃难，她大概也讨了饭，她做了老妈子，最后她不得不背着篓子，天天到北京城里城外去检破纸，换“取灯儿”。在这样的生活中，她按着人的要求，不管统驭人的礼教是什么，吸收了一个同乡的男朋友，两人住在一张炕上，“像一对小家雀”。两人整天研究如何弄到宫里拉出来的旧公文，以便多卖一点子。这时候，春桃却又碰见她打掉了两条腿的也是讨饭了的旧丈夫。她同情他，把他弄回家，三个人闹了蹩扭，又和好，男朋友做了“户主”，旧丈夫做了同居，三个人完全按着劳动人民的相互尊重，相互爱惜来团结着生活与工作。
    这一篇小说可以说是地山先生作品中难得的现实主义的作品。就在形式上也没有作者许多小说中的传奇性的成份。劳动人民纯洁自主的品质和高贵的阶级同情在这里是充分地表现出来了，同时他也没有忽略他们在生活斗争中的坚苦，他们的“盲闷的忧伤”和“率直的喜乐”。可以说地山先生基于他的落花生式的感情内容，对于朴质的劳动人民有相当深的了解和爱好。但是由于他的生活的限制，他不可能从阶级关系着眼，使春桃这种独立、明朗、诚实、坚强而善于感受的性格以及围绕着这个性格的生活经过对照，经过不同阶级关系的矛盾与斗争而更加具有雕刻的形象，具有目的性。他的平民主义限制了他，虽然《春桃》正是他的平民主义的成就。
    地山先生的平民主义和他的人道主义不可分离。在他少少二十二三篇具有现实性的成份的作品中，就有四篇是基于人道主义的立场来表现劳动人民的艰苦命运的。四篇文章无例外地他为这种可恨可恶的所谓命运愤怒而抗议。我在这里选择了三篇。在《法眼》里面，他为了一个园丁的冤屈死亡而抗议所谓法律，他指出“窃钩者诛，窃国者侯”的阶级对立中的现象。在《归途》中，他写出了一个佣妇的绝望的死亡以及环绕着她而发生的可悲的犯罪行为。在《危巢坠简》中，他更是正面地咒骂一些丧天害理，残害生命的行为。他的出发点是人道主义的，他的立场是同情受压迫人民的。可是也正因为他并没有能够超出这种出发点和一般的平民主义的立场，他就不能了解所谓“法眼”并不是人民的法眼，因此，它看不见人民的道理和人民的实情。他的《归途》更是没有打击对象的呼号，成为盲目的不知如何是好的愤怒。这两篇东西的传奇性本来就损伤了它所代表的阶级社会的真实，而他的小资产阶级的茫然的人道主义加上他的所谓生命就是破蛛网的哲学更使它们失掉了它们应有的力量。这些都是地山先生作品中未琢的璞玉，因为作者的生活及其思想未能及时地受到广大人民运动的琢磨。他对一般人民有深厚的同情，可是对于人民的运动和斗争却因为他的哲学而抱着怀疑，加以回避。他对于他的社会基本上不能了解，对他的国家的来路和前途也是茫然，甚至于悲观。他只是努力地依靠着他从平民主义出来的对受压迫人民的同情，从人道主义出来的正义感支持自己，甚至于强迫自己一天一天的来接近现实。他很痛苦，有时是很迷乱的来接近他本来所不愿接近的现实。他的这种努力并非白费。抗战帮助他跨了很大的一步。在这时候他放弃了佛经研究，也不多写作，而尽力参加民族解放的实际行动，努力于人民的工作。可是正当他在走这一步的时候，他的生命就停止了。
        四
    近三十年的中国文化史产生于多沙多石，多烈风雷雨的荒原。这个旧文化的荒原一方面没有从它的封建的过去累积多大肥土，另一方面跟着帝国主义洋枪大炮一道来到中国的资本主义社会的思想与作风，在中国起着很大的扰乱作用而不可能在中国找到生根的地方，来滋长出一套中国资产阶级的文化。因此，中国三十年来的文化史就必然跟着中国人民的解放斗争变成一页战斗得非常剧烈，非常勇猛而最后是人民文化胜利的战斗史。面迎战斗的巨匠们一个一个先后经由对反动派和自己的辛苦斗争脱离并反叛了自己的阶级，归向于人民，归属于无产阶级。我们有了鲁迅先生，有了陶行知先生，和闻一多先生，以及许多现在正在人民的事业中勤劳工作的人士。
    在这种大的历史运动中，地山先生是不得其时地早逝了的。他死在太平洋战争爆发以前的香港。这，无论对于中国的人民文化事业，或者对他自己，都应该说是损失，因为他是在向更好的方向发展中死去的。
    一九三九至一九四一是文化斗争在香港非常高涨的时期。环绕着中华文艺界抗敌协会香港分会而展开的组织与教育工作，在流亡香港的青年人中间变成了团结他们，鼓舞他们，提高他们的斗争勇气、知识和信心的中心力量。那时候，文协周围的青年团体有四、五个，在文协整个精神鼓舞下刊行的副刊及其他刊物不下十余种。地山先生当时是主持香港文协的。所有这些工作，地山先生除了生病几乎是无不参加。从在群众集会上做主席演讲到黑夜里去深水埗的小破楼上偷偷摸摸给几个十七八岁的流亡青年上补习课，他没有一次拒绝不到。没有什么刊物是他嫌太小而不肯动笔给写文章的。在这时候，国民党匪帮的驻港海外部一方面压迫他，要他出去给他们也开会挣场面，另一方面造他的谣，说他拍共产党的马屁，想出风头。他并不因之而对他们妥协，动摇他站在文协方面实地工作的热情。以他的这个时期和他在燕京闭门讲佛经，抱怨中华民族不长进的时期相比较，他的进步和发展令人几乎疑为奇迹。抗战暴露了国民党反动派的罪恶腐烂，逐步逐步地显出了只有共产党才真心抗战，真心服务人民。地山先生和许多诚实朴质的知识分子一样，正在奋不顾身地开始来了解并希望接受这一真理。他死在这个时候，岂不是一大不幸！
    他虽然是不得其时而死了，使他从小资产阶级的浪漫主义、平民主义、人道主义脱离，来归向人民，归属于无产阶级的道路不能走到它应有的目的地。但是，他打算走这条路的决心，从抗战初期他在香港两年多不断的努力中是看得见的。从他把佛经闲置起来，甚至把他在港大所教的中国旧文学也搁置起来，而天天上山下山奔走于香港九龙的闹市之中，参加在人民的行列里面活动的这些事实看起来，应该说在他的思想上开始了一个阶段性的转变，是他的平民主义与人道主义的向上发展。这种变化，这种发展，与闻一多所经历的差不多一致。因此，他的道路也与闻先生的道路基本上没有什么不同。他是中华民族值得骄傲的一个正直的有血性的儿子。
