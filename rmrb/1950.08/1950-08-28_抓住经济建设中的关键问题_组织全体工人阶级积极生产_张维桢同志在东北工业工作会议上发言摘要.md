　　Grasp the Key Problems in Economic Construction
    Organize the Entire Working Class for Active Production
    Excerpts from Comrade Zhang Weizhen's Speech at the Northeast Industrial Work Conference
    [Shenyang News] At the Industrial Work Conference convened by the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Comrade Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, reported on the work of trade unions in Northeast state-owned factories and mines over the past year. The report first pointed out that the trade union work had made achievements in the past year. Trade union organizations have been established in state-owned factories and mines, and more than 80% of the employees have joined the trade union. Through political, cultural, and technical education, as well as the implementation of labor protection and welfare programs, the consciousness of the working class has been raised, and a preliminary sense of responsibility for completing production has been established, playing a certain role in ensuring the completion of the state's production plan.

    However, with the large-scale recovery of industry in Northeast China, production has initially gotten on track, the economic accounting system has begun to be established, and a large number of new workers have been added, some problems urgently needing to be solved in trade union work have also been exposed. That is, the leadership of the trade union has an insufficient understanding of the new problems under the new situation, and has not grasped the central problems in industrial construction for implementation. The grassroots trade unions have not done enough to carry out other trade union work from the perspective of improving production, either relaxing production or neglecting the lives of employees. Among the majority of trade union cadres, because the work cannot penetrate into the production process and there is a lack of production knowledge, they cannot discover and solve problems in production in a timely manner, or summarize and promote advanced production experience.

    Regarding the formation of the above shortcomings, Comrade Zhang Weizhen pointed out that the first reason is the insufficient understanding of the nature of the trade union and the principle of uniting the entire working class. There is a closed-door mentality in the work. It has not actively absorbed technical personnel and staff into the trade union, nor has it conducted education aimed at certain antagonistic emotions between workers and technical personnel. Secondly, in handling certain issues, it has not proceeded from the overall interests of the country, but from the demands of some workers, and therefore lacks the spirit of uniting with factory and mine administration to do a good job in production.

    In order to improve the trade union work in state-owned factories and mines and undertake the task of the trade union in economic construction, Comrade Zhang Weizhen requested trade union cadres at all levels to do the following:

    1. Carefully study the Trade Union Law, clarify the nature and responsibilities of the trade union, and grasp the key issues in production, so as to educate and organize the entire working class to consciously engage in economic construction with the attitude of masters. 2. In order to improve product quality, reduce costs, and increase productivity, it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education of employees on economic accounting, strengthen the quality responsibility system and technical responsibility system; organize employees to learn technology, and do a good job in uniting technical personnel; establish mass conscious labor discipline through criticism and education; further carry out the New Record Movement, promote the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, and promote collective contracts and linked contracts, in order to promote the labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of employees and gradually make production competitions become the labor style and lifestyle of the working people. 3. Mobilize employees to help the administration improve enterprise management. This requires trade union cadres to penetrate into the production process, learn technology, and seriously participate in the formulation of production plans and the organization of the implementation of plans; widely absorb mass opinions and invigorate and enrich the work of the Management Committee. 4. Actively care for and protect the interests of the working class from the development of production. According to what is possible and urgently needed, and under the principle of combining with production, pay attention to improving the material and cultural lives of employees, and actively organize collective cultural and welfare undertakings. 5. The Party, government, trade union, and Youth League should jointly study the central issues that need to be resolved in enterprises in each period, unify steps, and divide labor and cooperate.

　　抓住经济建设中的关键问题
    组织全体工人阶级积极生产
    张维桢同志在东北工业工作会议上发言摘要
    【沈阳讯】在中共中央东北局召开之工业工作会议上，东北总工会主席张维桢同志报告了一年来东北公营厂矿的工会工作。报告首先指出：一年来工会工作是有成绩的。公营厂矿都建立了工会组织，百分之八十以上的职工已参加了工会。经过政治、文化、技术教育及劳保福利事业的设施，工人阶级觉悟提高了，初步树立了完成生产的责任观点，在保证完成国家生产计划上起了一定的作用。
    但在东北工业大规模的恢复，生产初步走上轨道，经济核算制度开始建立，新工人大量增加的情况下，也暴露出工会工作存在着一些急待解决的问题：这就是工会的领导上，对新情况下的新问题认识不足，没有抓紧工业建设中的中心问题进行贯彻；基层工会对如何从搞好生产中开展工会其他工作是做得不够的，不是放松生产，就是忽视职工生活；在大部工会干部中，因工作不能深入生产过程，及缺乏生产知识，以致不能及时发现和解决生产中的问题，总结和推广先进的生产经验。
    关于以上缺点的形成，张维桢同志指出：首先是由于对工会性质和团结全体工人阶级的方针认识不足，工作中存有关门主义，没有积极吸收技术人员和职员加入工会，也没有针对工人和技术人员间的某些对立情绪进行教育。其次是在处理某些问题时，没有从国家整体利益出发，而从部分工人要求出发，因而缺乏与厂矿行政团结一致搞好生产的精神。
    为了改进公营厂矿工会工作，担负起工会在经济建设中的任务，张维桢同志要求各级工会干部做到下列几点：
    一、仔细研究工会法，弄清工会的性质和责任，抓紧生产中的关键问题，以便教育和组织全体工人阶级自觉地以主人翁的态度从事经济建设。二、为改进产品质量，降低成本，提高生产率，必须加强职工经济核算的思想教育，加强质量责任与技术责任制；组织职工学习技术，做好团结技术人员工作；通过批评与教育，建立群众自觉的劳动纪律；进一步开展新纪录运动，推广马恒昌小组的先进经验，推广集体合同和联系合同，以发扬广大职工的劳动积极性，逐渐使生产竞赛成为劳动人民的劳动方式和生活方式。三、发动职工帮助行政改善企业经营与管理。这就要求工会干部必须深入生产过程，学习技术，认真参加生产计划的制订与组织计划的执行；广泛吸收群众意见，活跃与充实管委会的工作。四、积极地从发展生产中关心与保护工人阶级的利益。根据可能与迫切需要，在与生产相结合的原则下，注意改善职工的物质生活与文化生活，从积极方面举办集体的文化、福利事业。五、党、政、工、团应共同研究每个时期企业中需要解决的中心问题，统一步调，分工配合。
