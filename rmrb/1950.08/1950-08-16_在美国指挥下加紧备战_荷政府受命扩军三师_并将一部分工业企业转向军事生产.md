　　Under US Command, Preparations Intensify
    Dutch Government Ordered to Expand Army by Three Divisions
    And Convert Some Industrial Enterprises to Military Production
    [Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, 11th] TASS, The Hague, 6th: Dutch newspapers report that the Dutch government is taking various steps, according to the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty, to establish three infantry divisions, which will be constantly in a state of combat readiness. The Dutch government has requested the United States to provide the weapons necessary to equip these three divisions. "De Telegraaf" said that military sources pointed out that the Netherlands' annual conscription quota will be increased to 90,000, and the term of service will be extended by half. In October, 40,000 eligible people from the 1950 class will be called up and fully equipped with American weapons.
    The Dutch government is also taking measures to convert some industrial enterprises to military production.
    The Dutch Communist Party's newspaper "De Waarheid," commenting on the government's decision, emphasized that "these measures will further worsen the country's economic situation, plunging the working people into hunger and poverty. All this is happening because Truman demanded that the Dutch government increase military spending and war production."

　　在美国指挥下加紧备战
    荷政府受命扩军三师
    并将一部分工业企业转向军事生产
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社海牙六日讯：荷报报道：荷兰政府正按照北大西洋公约的规定，采取各种步骤建立三个步兵师，这些步兵师将经常处于备战状态下。荷政府曾向美国要求给予配备这三个师所必需的武器。电讯报说：军方人士指出：荷兰每年征兵额将增到九万人，服役期将延长一倍半。在十月，将有四万名一九五○级适龄人民被召入伍，并充分配备以美国武器。
    荷兰政府还在采取措施把一部分工业企业转向军事生产。
    荷兰共产党机关报真理报在评论政府的决定时着重指出：“这些措施将使国家的经济局面更加恶化，使劳动人民陷于饥馑与贫困。这一切事情的发生，原因都在于杜鲁门要求荷兰政府增加军费和战争生产”。
