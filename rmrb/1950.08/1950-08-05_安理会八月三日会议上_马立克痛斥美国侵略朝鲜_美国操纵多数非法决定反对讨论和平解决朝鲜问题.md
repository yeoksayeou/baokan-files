Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 4th: TASS, New York, August 4th: The Security Council meeting on the 3rd, chaired by Soviet representative Malik, continued to discuss the issue of adopting the provisional agenda proposed by Malik in his capacity as President of the Security Council on the 1st.

The Security Council continued to discuss the two proposals it had reviewed the previous day: one was the proposal by the Soviet delegation, requesting the Security Council to discuss the issue of recognizing the People's Government of China as the legitimate representative of China in the Security Council, and to discuss, as the second item on the agenda, the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. The other was a proposal by the US delegation requesting priority discussion of the US proposal aimed at opposing North Korea. Here, it should be recalled that US representative Austin had proposed an amendment at the Security Council meeting on the 2nd, intending to give priority to the US proposal aimed at expanding the Korean War.

At the meeting on the 3rd, the first to speak was British representative Jebb, who supported the amendment proposed by Austin on the 2nd. Subsequently, Malik spoke in his capacity as the Soviet representative. Malik pointed out that the Security Council had held three consecutive meetings to discuss procedural issues, namely, setting the agenda items. Malik said that during the discussion, two main positions had become clear: one was to discuss the Korean issue on the basis of a willingness to peacefully resolve it, as suggested by the Soviet Union; the other was to deal with the Korean issue with the aim of intensifying the aggression against Korea. Malik also said that the Soviet Union was striving to follow procedures leading to a peaceful settlement, while the US government was attempting to distort the true picture of the Korean situation in order to cover up US aggression in Korea.

Malik then elaborated on the events that led to the current situation in Korea. He emphasized that the facts showed that it was the United States that provoked the war in Korea, and that the US puppet, Syngman Rhee, launched an attack across the 38th parallel on the orders of MacArthur. Malik pointed to photographs published in American newspapers on June 26, showing State Department advisor Dulles and US Ambassador to South Korea Muccio standing in the trenches south of the 38th parallel with US military officers and representatives of Syngman Rhee's armed forces. Malik pointed out that Dulles and Muccio "were not picking violets," but were preparing for aggression.

Malik said that the United States provoked the war in Korea, and then seized the opportunity created by the situation at that time to intervene with its armed forces. The United States is undoubtedly the aggressor in Korea.

Malik emphasized that the essence of the Korean issue is: a civil war is taking place in Korea, and the United States is interfering in this civil war, and using the US army, navy, and air force to attack the Korean people. This is blatant aggression. The United States is now seeking to expand its aggression in Korea and extend it to other parts of Asia. The Security Council faces a choice: either choose the path to peace or the path to war. The Soviet proposal regarding the provisional agenda is the path to peace, its goal is to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. On the other hand, the US position pursues the goal of expanding the Korean War. The Security Council must make a choice between the two paths, but it can only make this choice when its composition is legitimate. Therefore, the Soviet delegation insists that the Security Council immediately recognize the representative of the People's Government of China. If this is ignored, then all resolutions made by the Security Council will be illegal.

Malik said that the resolutions on Korea passed by the Security Council under the insistence of the United States are illegal and invalid. Malik reiterated that the Soviet delegation requests the Security Council to adopt the two items listed in the provisional agenda already proposed by the President of the Security Council, and insists that the Security Council should reject the US proposal aimed at expanding the Korean War.

Next to speak was Indian representative Rau, who said that the Indian delegation agreed to include the two items proposed by Malik on the agenda, but believed that the US proposal should also be included on the agenda. Rau moved that the Security Council should first vote on the agenda, and then decide which agenda item – the Soviet proposal or the US proposal – should be considered first.

Egyptian representative Fawzi supported the Indian position and informally suggested that the Security Council vote on the issue of adopting the agenda without any further discussion.

US representative Austin then suggested that the Security Council vote on the amendment proposed on the 2nd.

Austin ranted and raved, complaining that Malik was using his position to make "propaganda attacks" against the United States. He tried to prove that the purpose of the American act of aggression was to help establish peace, but he could not cite any facts to refute Malik's convincing remarks condemning American aggression.

After Austin finished his speech, Malik said that, as the Soviet representative, he was willing to respond to Austin's hysterical remarks. Malik said that loud noises and hysterical screams can never resolve any dispute. Malik emphasized that Austin had not even attempted to refute anything Malik had said.

French representative Chauvel then spoke, saying that the French delegation supported the US position.

The Yugoslav representative stated that he would abstain when voting on the order of agenda items and the issue of peacefully resolving the Korean War.

Malik then decided that the Security Council would first vote on the following provisional agenda item: Representation of the People's Government of China and the peaceful settlement of the Korean War. British representative Jebb opposed this decision. After a short discussion, the Security Council held a vote and rejected Malik's decision. Ecuador, France, Norway, Britain, the United States, Cuba, and the Kuomintang elements voted against the Chairman's decision. The Soviet Union and India voted in favor of this decision. Yugoslavia and Egypt abstained.

As a result of the vote, the Security Council decided to include the item proposed by the United States on the agenda. Ecuador, Egypt, France, Norway, Britain, the United States, Cuba, and the Kuomintang elements voted in favor of this proposal; the Soviet Union voted against it; India and Yugoslavia abstained.

The Security Council then voted on whether to include the item allowing representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend, with five countries voting in favor of including this issue on the agenda, namely the Soviet Union, India, Yugoslavia, Norway, and Britain; the United States, France, Ecuador, Cuba, and the Kuomintang representative voted against it; Egypt abstained.

Three countries – the Soviet Union, India, and Egypt – voted in favor of including the item on peacefully resolving the Korean issue proposed by the Soviet representative; the United States, Britain, France, Ecuador, Cuba, Norway, and the Kuomintang representative voted against it. The Yugoslav representative abstained.

Malik then announced that, as a result, only one issue remained on the agenda – the issue proposed by the United States. Malik said that the Soviet Union believes that this decision is illegal, aimed at preventing the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, and against restoring the legitimacy of the Security Council by the participation of the five permanent members in the work of the Security Council.

The next meeting is scheduled to be held on the 4th.

### 安理会八月三日会议上  马立克痛斥美国侵略朝鲜  美国操纵多数非法决定反对讨论和平解决朝鲜问题

　　安理会八月三日会议上
    马立克痛斥美国侵略朝鲜
    美国操纵多数非法决定反对讨论和平解决朝鲜问题
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社纽约四日讯：安理会三日的会议，在苏联代表马立克主持下继续讨论通过马立克在一日以安理会主席身份提出的临时议程的问题。
    安理会继续讨论它在前一天审议过的两个建议：一个是苏联代表团的建议，即要求安理会讨论承认中国人民政府为中国在安理会的合法代表的问题，并讨论作为议程的第二项，讨论和平解决朝鲜的问题。另一个是美国代表团提出的建议，即要求优先讨论旨在反对北朝鲜的美国提案。在这里，应当追述，美国代表奥斯汀在二日的安理会会议上曾提出一项修正案，意图使旨在扩大朝鲜战争的美国建议得到优先讨论。
    在三日的会议上，首先发言的是英国代表杰伯，他支持奥斯汀在二日提出的修正案。随后，马立克即以苏联代表资格发言。马立克指出，安理会已连续举行三次会议讨论程序问题，即订定议程的项目。马立克说，在讨论过程中，已表明有两种主要的立场：一种是在愿意和平解决的基础上讨论朝鲜问题，有如苏联所建议的那样；另一种是抱着加紧侵略朝鲜的目的来处理朝鲜问题。马立克又说，苏联力求遵从导致和平解决的程序，而美国政府却图谋歪曲朝鲜情势的真象，以便掩护美国在朝鲜的侵略。
    马立克继而详论造成目前朝鲜局势的事件。他着重指出：事实表明，是美国在朝鲜挑起了战争，而且美国的傀儡李承晚奉麦克阿瑟的命令越过三八线发动了攻击。马立克指着六月二十六日美国报纸刊登的照片，在这个照片上，可以看到国务院顾问杜勒斯和美国驻南朝鲜大使缪锡俄，在三八线南边的战壕中与美国军官们及李承晚武装部队的代表们站在一起。马立克指出：杜勒斯和缪锡俄“并不是在采紫罗兰”，而是在准备侵略。
    马立克说：美国挑起了朝鲜的战事，于是抓住了当时发生的情况所造成的机会，以它的武装部队进行干涉。美国毫无问题是朝鲜的侵略者。
    马立克着重地说，朝鲜问题的本质是：朝鲜正在进行内战，美国则正在干涉这个内战，并使用美国陆海空军攻击朝鲜人民。这就是公然的侵略。美国现在谋图扩大在朝鲜的侵略，并使其扩大到亚洲其他地区。安理会面对着这样的抉择：或者是选择到和平的道路，或者是选择到战争的道路。苏联关于临时议程的建议，乃是到和平的道路，其目标是和平解决朝鲜问题。另方面，美国的立场则追求着扩大朝鲜战争的目的。安理会必须在两个道路之间作一抉择，但是，只有当它的成份是合法的时候，它才能作这种抉择，因此，苏联代表团坚主安理会立即承认中国人民政府的代表。如果这一点被忽视，那么，安理会所作的一切决议都会成为非法。
    马立克说：安理会在美国坚持之下通过的关于朝鲜的决议都是非法的和无效的。马立克重申：苏联代表团要求安理会通过安理会主席已经提出的临时议程中所列两个项目，并坚主：安理会应拒绝美国的旨在扩大朝鲜战争的建议。
    接着发言的是印度代表劳氏，他说，印度代表团赞成把马立克提出的两项列入议程，但认为美国的建议也应列入议程。劳氏提出动议，安理会应首先表决议程，然后解决那一项议程——苏联的建议还是美国的建议——应首先予以审议。
    埃及代表法齐支持印度的立场，继而非正式地建议安理会就通过议程的问题进行表决，而不作任何进一步的讨论。
    美国代表奥斯汀于是建议安理会表决二日提出的修正案。
    奥斯汀大吵大闹地抱怨马立克利用他的地位对美国作“宣传攻击”，他企图证明美国的侵略行为的目的，在于协助建立和平，但他不能举出任何事实来反驳马立克谴责美国的侵略行为的令人信服的言论。
    在奥斯汀结束了他的演说后，马立克说：作为苏联的代表，他愿意答复奥斯汀的歇斯底里的言论。马立克说：大声喧闹与歇斯底里的尖锐叫声，从来不能解决任何争论。马立克强调指出，奥斯汀甚至未曾试图反驳马立克所说的任何一句话。
    法国代表萧维尔继而发言说，法国代表团支持美国的立场。
    南斯拉夫代表称，在表决议程项目的顺序与和平解决朝鲜战争问题时，他将弃权。
    马立克于是决定安理会首先表决下列临时议程项目：中国人民政府的代表权与和平解决朝鲜战争。英国代表杰伯反对该一决定。经过短时间的讨论，安理会即举行表决，否决了马立克的决定。厄瓜多尔、法国、挪威、英国、美国、古巴，还有国民党分子投票反对主席的决定。苏联与印度投票赞成这一决定。南斯拉夫与埃及弃权。
    表决结果，安理会便决定把美国提出的项目列入议程。厄瓜多尔、埃及、法国、挪威、英国、美国、古巴和国民党分子投票赞成这个建议；苏联投票反对；印度和南斯拉夫弃权。
    安理会然后表决是否把允许中华人民共和国代表出席这一项排入议程，五国投票赞成把这一问题排入议程，即苏联、印度、南斯拉夫、挪威和英国；美国、法国、厄瓜多尔、古巴以及国民党代表投票反对；埃及弃权。
    三国——苏联、印度与埃及——投票赞成将苏联代表提出的和平解决朝鲜问题一项列入议程；美国、英国、法国、厄瓜多尔、古巴、挪威与国民党代表投票反对。南斯拉夫代表弃权。
    马立克继而宣布，这样一来，议程上只剩下一个问题——美国所提出的问题。马立克说，苏联认为：这一决定是非法的，目的在阻止和平解决朝鲜问题，并反对由五个常任理事国参加安理会的工作来恢复安理会的合法性。
    下次会议定于四日举行。
