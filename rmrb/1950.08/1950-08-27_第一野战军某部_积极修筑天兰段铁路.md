A Unit of the First Field Army
    Actively Constructs the Tianlan Section of the Railway
    【Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 22nd】 A unit of the People's Liberation Army's First Field Army is contracted to build the Tianshui to Lanzhou section of the Longhai Railway. From May 1st to mid-August, it has completed over 1.2 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. The project is currently underway along the entire Tianshui to Wushan section.
    The Tianlan section of the Longhai Railway runs westward from Beidaobu in Tianshui, passing through Gangu, Wushan, Longxi, Dingxi, and reaching Lanzhou, with a total length of 376 kilometers. Along the route, due to the obstruction of the Wei River and numerous mountains and ridges, the required engineering amounts to over 28 million cubic meters of earth and stone work. The route also requires the digging of 62 tunnels and the construction of 489 large and small bridges, making the project extremely arduous. All commanders and fighters of the PLA railway construction unit have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm, humbly learning from engineers and technicians. They have also conducted a "five appraisals" movement during the labor process, namely appraising ideology, attitude, mutual assistance, technology, and care for the body, creating many methods to overcome difficulties, making themselves a powerful railway construction unit with organization, labor discipline, and project planning. The labor efficiency of each unit is steadily improving day by day. In May, a certain division averaged 2.2 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day, which increased to 3.5 cubic meters in June (with individual units reaching 8.3 cubic meters). A certain artillery company utilized the principles of inclined planes and pulleys to create a soft-rail circulating four-wheeled vehicle to transport loess, improving the efficiency of earth transportation.

　　第一野战军某部
    积极修筑天兰段铁路
    【新华社西安二十二日电】人民解放军第一野战军某部包修陇海铁路天水至兰州段的建筑工程，从五月一日至八月中旬，已完成土方、石方工程一百二十余万立方公尺，现工程正在天水至武山段全线进行。
    陇海铁路天兰段从天水北道埠向西行，经甘谷、武山、陇西、定西等地而达兰州，全长三百七十六公里。沿线因受渭河和许多丛山峻岭的阻隔，所需工程计达土方、石方二千八百余万立方公尺，沿线并需挖隧道六十二处，筑大小桥梁四百八十九座，工程甚为艰巨。解放军筑路部队全体指挥员、战斗员发挥高度的劳动热情，虚心向工程师和技术人员学习，并在劳动过程中进行五评运动，即评思想、评态度、评互助、评技术和评爱护身体，创造了许多克服困难的办法，使自己成为一支有组织、有劳动纪律、有工程计划的强大的修路部队。各部劳动效率，正在日益稳步提高。某师五月份平均每人每天开土方二点二立方公尺，六月份就提高到三点五立方公尺（个别单位达八点三立方公尺）。某炮兵连利用斜面和滑轮的原理，制造出软轨循环四轮车运送黄土，提高了运土的效率。
