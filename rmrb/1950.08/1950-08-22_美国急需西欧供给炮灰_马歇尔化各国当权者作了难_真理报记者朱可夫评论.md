Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS Moscow, 17th: *Pravda* reporter Zhukov's Paris dispatch reads: American generals are indeed nervous. In preparing for a new war, they want to gamble on relying on heavy bombers, rocket launchers, and atomic bombs. But as soon as they launched the war in Korea, it confirmed the well-known truth: what determines the outcome of any war is the people who control the materials, not just the materials themselves. American military theorists are now talking in various tones about: infantry, there is an urgent need for infantry! But where to get the infantry? American senators are therefore increasingly pointing their fingers at Western Europe: now is the time to demand repayment for the Marshall Plan. Let the satellite countries begin to form new divisions! And do it quickly!

　　This has caused tension among the authorities of the Marshallized countries. Obviously, the arms race will inevitably completely destroy the Western European economy, which has already been damaged by the Marshall Plan, and will cause greater inflation and poverty. And the result of all this will be the growing dissatisfaction of the working masses. In this case, is it possible to cope with the situation and suppress the anger of the entire people? Experts who are thoroughly versed in police affairs shake their heads and say: it is very difficult.

　　美国急需西欧供给炮灰
    马歇尔化各国当权者作了难
    真理报记者朱可夫评论
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十七日讯：真理报记者朱可夫的巴黎通讯写道：美国将军们的确是神经紧张了。他们在准备新战争中想依靠重轰炸机、火箭炮及原子弹作孤注一掷。但他们刚一在朝鲜发动战争，就证实了那句人所共知的真理：决定任何一次战争的胜负的，是控制物质的人，而不仅仅是物质本身。美国军事理论家们现在正以各种不同的语气谈论着：步兵，迫切地需要步兵！但步兵到那里去弄呢？美国参议员们于是越来越频繁地将他们的手指指向西欧：现在是要求马歇尔计划的报酬的时候了。让卫星国着手组成新师团吧！并且要赶快一点！
    这引起了马歇尔化各国当权者的紧张。很明显地，军备竞赛将不可避免地完全毁灭已为马歇尔计划破坏了的西欧经济，并将造成更大的通货膨胀及穷困。而所有这些的结果，将是劳动群众日益增长的不满。在这种情况下，要应付情势和压制整个人民的愤怒是可能的吗？彻底通晓警察事务的专家们摇头说：很难。
