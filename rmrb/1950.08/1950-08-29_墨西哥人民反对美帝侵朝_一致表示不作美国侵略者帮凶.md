Xinhua News Agency, August 28th dispatch from New York: Mexican newspapers report that the news of Mexico's plan to send troops to support the US aggression against Korea has aroused great anger among the entire Mexican people.

    The Mexican newspaper "Voz de México" raised the slogan: "No interference in Korea! Give the Korean people peace, independence, and freedom! Americans get out of Korea!". The newspaper strongly protested against the indiscriminate bombing of Korean cities and villages by US aircraft and the killing of peaceful people, and urged the Mexican people to intensify their struggle to defend peace and oppose war-mongers. Even right-wing newspapers such as "El Día", "El Universal", and "Novedades" have voiced opposition. "Novedades" published on its front page a special article by former Mexican Finance Minister Cabrera, using the pen name Blas Urrea, entitled "Reaping What You Sow". The author criticized the US aggression against Korea, criticized the Security Council's illegal decisions regarding Korea, and opposed the US request for assistance in the war in Korea.

    Blas Urrea wrote that the United States has deprived Latin American countries of their independence and is now demanding that they supply cannon fodder, weapons, oil, and money. But he asked, what can Latin American countries offer? Ships? We are not allowed to build a navy, and we have no merchant ships because shipping is monopolized by foreign vessels. Air force? The planes are bought from second-hand shops, and the planes have no weapons because our neighbor (referring to the United States) will only give us weapons when our air force is willing to fly to that ominous, unfamiliar, and distant foreign country.

    A reporter for the New York "Daily Worker" reported from Mexico City that the article "Reaping What You Sow" aroused excitement among readers and sparked positive comments throughout Mexico because it reflects the anti-American sentiment of people from all walks of life in Mexico and other Latin American countries.

　　墨西哥人民反对美帝侵朝
    一致表示不作美国侵略者帮凶
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：墨西哥报纸消息称，关于墨西哥拟派军队支持美国侵略朝鲜的消息，引起墨西哥全体人民极大的愤怒。
    墨西哥呼声报提出口号：“不许干涉朝鲜！给予朝鲜人民和平、独立与自由！美国人滚出朝鲜去！”。该报强烈抗议美机滥炸朝鲜的城市与乡村，残杀和平人民，并敦促墨西哥人民加紧为保卫和平、为反对战争贩子而斗争。甚至右翼的报纸如“日报”、“世界报”、“现代报”等，都提出反对。“现代报”在第一版刊载了前墨西哥财政部长卡布雷罗以布拉斯·乌尔雷亚的笔名发表的一篇专论，题为《自食其果》。作者抨击美国侵略朝鲜，抨击安理会关于朝鲜的非法决定，并且反对美国所提出的协助美国在朝鲜作战的要求。
    布拉斯·乌尔雷亚写道，美国剥夺了拉丁美洲国家的独立，现在又要求它们供给炮灰、武器、石油与金钱。但是他问道，拉丁美洲国家能够出些什么呢？船舰吗？人家不准我们建立海军，我们也没有商船，因为航运是由外国船只垄断的。航空队吗？飞机是从旧货店里买来的，飞机也没有武器，因为我们的邻邦（指美国）只有在我国的航空队愿意飞到那不祥而陌生的，辽远的外国去的时候才会给我们武器。
    纽约“工人日报”记者自墨西哥城来讯称，《自食其果》这篇文章引起了读者的激动，并且在墨西哥全国引起了正面的评论，因为它反映了墨西哥和拉丁美洲其他国家各阶层人民的反美情绪。
