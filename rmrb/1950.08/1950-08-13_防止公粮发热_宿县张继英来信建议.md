　　Prevent Public Grain from Heating Up
    A letter and suggestion from Zhang Jiying of Su County:

    Comrade Editor:
    I am writing to inform you of a case of public grain heating up, which I request be published in the newspaper to draw the attention of grain storage personnel and grain requisitioning personnel in all regions.

    The summer grain requisitioning work in the Su County sub-district has generally begun. In Lingbi County, three out of eight districts have completed their storage tasks, and four districts have completed half of their warehousing. Yongcheng County has already stored over two million jin of grain, and other counties have also stored grain (exact figures are not available). According to reports from individual counties, all wheat grain is heating up. If it is not urgently turned and sun-dried, there is a risk of spoilage. The reasons for this are: first, the quality of the grain was originally not good, and continuous rain has further caused the grain to become damp. Second, rain was encountered during the grain requisitioning process. Third, village cadres, in order to simply complete their tasks, did not pay attention to the quality of the grain during requisitioning.

    Under these conditions of large-scale grain concentration, it is difficult to carry out turning and sun-drying. Because to complete this work, a large number of people must be mobilized, and in the busy agricultural season, it is difficult to mobilize a large number of farmers to do this work. It is both labor-intensive and results in large losses. It is hoped that all regions, when requisitioning public grain, must effectively mobilize and educate the masses, truly ensuring that the grain is dried in the sun and thoroughly cleaned, to avoid unnecessary losses.
            Su County Special District Office, Zhang Jiying

### 防止公粮发热  宿县张继英来信建议

　　防止公粮发热
    宿县张继英来信建议编者同志：
    我告诉你一件公粮发热的事情，请在报纸上发表，以引起各地粮食保管人员及征粮人员的注意。
    宿县分区夏征工作已普遍开始。灵壁县八个区已有三个区完成入库任务，四个区已有一半入仓。永城县则已入仓二百余万斤粮食，其他各县亦有入库者（数字不详）。现据个别县份的反映，麦粮已全部发热，若不紧急翻晒，将有霉烂的危险。检查其原因：第一、粮食的成色原来就不好，加上阴雨连绵，更使粮食受潮。第二、在征粮中遇到了雨。第三、村干部为了单纯地完成任务，便在征粮中不注意粮食的成色。
    在这种粮食大量集中的条件下，要进行翻晒是困难的。因为要完成这个工作，必须动员大批的人力，而在农忙的季节，要动员大批农民进行这个工作又是困难的。既劳民，损耗又大。希望各地在征公粮时，必须很好的动员群众、教育群众，真正做到晒干扬净，免遭不应有的损失。
            宿县专署张继英
