The Department of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Resources Board, and the "Economic Cooperation Administration" all sent representatives to participate in the work of the bureau. The director is Barrett, the Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs.

　　妄图掩饰侵略朝鲜的可耻失败
    美成立“全国心理战略局”
    【新华社二十日讯】据美国新闻处消息，美国国务院于八月十七日宣布在国务卿之下成立一个名为“全国心理战略局”的部际机构，以调配政府各部门之间的反苏反共与战争的宣传与特务活动，负责策划及准备冷战的“心理方面”。国防部、参谋长联席会议，中央情报局、全国安全资源委员会和“经济合作总署”均派代表参加该局工作。局长由负责公共事务的助理国务卿巴利特担任。据美国国务院新闻官怀特称：该局目前的第一项工作就是要破坏苏联在安理会所提“和平解决朝鲜问题”提案在世界人民中间引起的影响，而为美国在朝鲜的侵略行动与可耻的失败进行掩饰。
