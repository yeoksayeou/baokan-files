　　Today, we warmly celebrate the fifth anniversary of the liberation of our neighbor, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and extend our highest respect to the heroic Korean people and their leader, General Kim Il-sung, who are currently engaged in a just war against aggression.
　　Five years ago, the great Soviet army crushed the main force of Japanese imperialism, the Kwantung Army. Japan was forced to declare its surrender. Our Northeast and Korea were thus liberated at the same time. The Korean people, under the wise leadership of General Kim Il-sung and with the fraternal help of the Soviet Union, should have been able to build a democratic, independent, happy, prosperous, and unified country throughout Korea according to their own will. However, the American imperialists, who took advantage of the anti-fascist war, occupied South Korea. The American government not only defied the will of the Korean people and delayed its withdrawal, but also created the Lee Seung-man puppet government in South Korea, implementing a bloody anti-people rule; moreover, it was hostile to the democratic rights already obtained by the liberated North Korean people. American imperialism and its running dog, the Lee Seung-man clique, were hostile to the various democratic reforms carried out by the North Korean people over the past five years, and tried every means to sabotage them. The implementation of the North Korean Land Reform Law, Labor Law, Nationalization of Industries Law, and the Law on Equality between Men and Women, etc., made the North Korean people truly the masters of the new country and the new society. North Korean workers changed from working fourteen to sixteen hours a day under Japanese imperialist rule, with wages low enough to only buy six small pancakes a day, to a new life under the eight-hour working system guaranteed by the Labor Law, with social insurance and equal pay for equal work. After the implementation of the Land Reform Law, 700,000 poor peasants and farm laborers in North Korea obtained land, which increased their enthusiasm for production, liberated rural productive forces, and increased North Korea's grain harvest in 1949 by more than one million tons compared to before liberation; the vast number of peasants were rescued from constant food shortages and achieved self-sufficiency in grain. All of this was hated by the American imperialists and the Lee Seung-man puppet clique. They deliberately wanted to put the shackles of slavery on the necks of the Korean people and turn Korea into a colony of Wall Street. American imperialism violated all international agreements on resolving the Korean issue, illegally used the name of the United Nations Commission on Korea, prepared for and finally implemented direct armed aggression against Korea.
　　But American imperialism underestimated the strength of the Korean people. From the outbreak of the war on the 38th parallel to the present, fifty days have passed, and the heroic Korean People's Army has continuously achieved brilliant victories, greatly inspiring the people of the world who are striving for justice and peace. The puppet government of the Lee Seung-man clique has now been basically eliminated. Although the American aggressors have successively deployed troops to reinforce their forces, their feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the mud. Six-fifths of the land in South Korea has been liberated, and the People's Army has crossed the Nakdong River and is advancing towards Busan and Jinhae. We warmly celebrate the victories already achieved by the Korean people, and we deeply admire the Korean people for their arduous battles in the past fifty days, overcoming all difficulties and constantly defeating the brutal enemy. Nevertheless, there will still be many difficulties in the future, and more emphasis should be placed on estimating the difficulties in order to make fuller preparations to meet and overcome any difficulties. We believe that the heroic Korean people have all the strength to overcome any difficulties. The just people of the whole world stand on the side of the Korean people. The seemingly strong but essentially weak American imperialism will become increasingly isolated, it is bound to fail, and victory will surely belong to the Korean people.
　　Now the American imperialist bandits, in their desperate struggle, are displaying all their beastly nature. American planes are indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities and villages in Korea. American officers shamelessly boast of the tonnage of bombs they have dropped. American defeated soldiers are burning and killing on a large scale in the areas they are about to withdraw from, to vent their anger over their defeat. Such insane and barbaric atrocities are unanimously and resolutely protested by the Chinese people and all kind people around the world. But we are also seeing from these atrocities the seemingly strong but essentially weak fragility of American imperialism itself.
　　On the other hand of the crimes of American imperialism is the set of absurd and shameless deceptive tricks it is carrying out in the United Nations. It brazenly disregards everything, controls the Security Council, and uses the flag of the United Nations as a fig leaf for its crimes of aggression. The return of Soviet representative Malik to the Security Council has torn this fig leaf apart. Even though the United States continues to manipulate the voting machine and obstructs the passage of the Soviet proposal for a "peaceful solution to the Korean issue," this can only further prove to the people of the world that American imperialism is determined not to abandon its crimes of aggression to the death, thus further arousing the struggle of the people of the world against the American aggressors.
　　On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Korea, we must vigorously support the just war of the Korean people on the one hand, and warmly support the peaceful policies adopted by the Soviet Union in the United Nations on the other. These two are not contradictory but complementary. To prompt the American aggressors to suffer the comprehensive, thorough, and shameful defeat they deserve, and to realize lasting world peace, efforts should be made in both military and political aspects.
　　The continuous victories of the heroic Korean people in the past fifty days, and the strong support of hundreds of millions of people around the world who defend peace for the Korean people, have put American imperialism in an embarrassing position. We respectfully wish the just war of the Korean people for independence, freedom, and democratic reunification, with the enthusiastic support of the just people of the world and the continued efforts of the Korean people themselves to overcome all possible difficulties and persist in the fight, to achieve final victory! Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

### 祝朝鲜解放五周年

　　祝朝鲜解放五周年
    今天，我们热烈祝贺我们的邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国解放五周年，并向当前进行着反侵略的正义战争的英勇的朝鲜人民及其领袖金日成将军致崇高的敬意。
    五年以前，伟大的苏联军队粉碎了日本帝国主义的主力关东军。日本被迫宣布投降了。我国的东北和朝鲜因此而同时得到了解放。朝鲜人民，在金日成将军的英明领导和苏联的兄弟般的帮助之下，本来应该能够在全朝鲜按照自己的意志建设民主独立幸福繁荣和统一的国家。但是在反法西斯战争中投机取巧的美帝国主义占领了南朝鲜。美国政府不仅违背朝鲜人民的意志，延不撤兵，在南朝鲜一手制造了李承晚傀儡政府，实行反人民的血腥统治；而且仇视解放了的北朝鲜人民所已得的民主权利。美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚集团仇视北朝鲜人民五年来所进行的各项民主改革，千方百计加以破坏。北朝鲜土地改革法令、劳动法令、产业国有化法令及男女平等法令等的实施，使北朝鲜人民真正成了新国家新社会的主人。北朝鲜工人从过去在日本帝国主义统治下每天工作十四至十六小时，工资低到每天只够买六个小烧饼，改变到在劳动法所保证的八小时工作制、实行社会保险与同工同酬等制度下的新生活。北朝鲜七十万贫雇农，在土地改革法令实施以后获得了土地，提高了生产积极性，解放了农村生产力，使一九四九年北朝鲜的谷物收获量比解放前增加了一百多万吨；广大农民从过去不断粮荒中解救出来，达到了粮食的自给自足。这一切都为美帝国主义和李承晚傀儡集团所仇视。它们蓄意要把奴隶的锁链套在朝鲜人民的脖颈上，要把朝鲜变为华尔街的殖民地。美帝国主义破坏了一切关于解决朝鲜问题的国际协议，非法利用联合国朝鲜委员会的名义，准备了并且终于实行了对朝鲜的直接武装侵略。
    但是美帝国主义过低地估计了朝鲜人民的力量。从三八线上的战事发生到现在五十天了，英勇的朝鲜人民军接连不断地造成了辉煌的胜利，使全世界争取正义和平的人民得到极大的鼓舞。现在李承晚集团的傀儡政府基本上已被消灭了。美国侵略者尽管陆续调兵增援，泥足却愈陷愈深。南朝鲜六分之五的土地已经获得了解放，人民军渡过了洛东江，正向釜山、镇海挺进。我们热烈庆贺朝鲜人民已得的胜利，我们深深地敬佩朝鲜人民在过去五十天中的艰苦战斗，克服了一切困难，不断战胜着残暴的敌人。虽然如此，今后也还会有许多困难，而且应该更多地估计困难的一面，以便进行更充分的准备去迎接与战胜任何困难。我们相信，英勇的朝鲜人民，是有一切力量战胜任何困难的。全世界正义人民都站在朝鲜人民这一方面。外强中干的美帝国主义将日益孤立，它是一定要失败的，胜利一定属于朝鲜人民。
    现在美国帝国主义强盗们在绝望的挣扎中，发挥着所有的兽性。美国飞机正在滥炸朝鲜的和平城市和乡村。美国军官竟无耻地以所投炸弹吨数来夸耀。美国败兵正在要退出的地区大烧大杀，来给自己的战败泄愤。这种疯狂野蛮的暴行是我们中国人民和全世界一切善良人民所一致坚决抗议的。可是我们也正从这等暴行中间看到了美国帝国主义本身外强中干的脆弱性。
    在美国帝国主义的罪恶的另一方面就是它在联合国方面所进行的一套荒谬无耻的骗人把戏。它悍然不顾一切地把持安理会，利用联合国的旗子来作侵略罪行的遮羞布。苏联代表马立克重回安理会之后把美国的这块遮羞布扯破了。纵然美国还在继续操纵表决机器，阻挠苏联“和平解决朝鲜问题”提案的通过；但这只能在全世界人民面前更加证明美国帝国主义是至死不肯放弃其侵略的罪行，因而更加激起全世界人民反对美国侵略者的斗争。
    当着朝鲜解放五周年纪念日，我们要一面大力支援朝鲜人民的正义战争，一面热烈拥护苏联在联合国所采取的和平政策。这两者不是相反而是相成的。要促使美国侵略者遭受罪所应得的全面彻底的可耻失败，使世界的持久和平得以实现，在军事上和政治上都是应当用力的。
    英勇的朝鲜人民五十天来连续的胜利，全世界保卫和平的亿万人民对朝鲜人民的有力支持，已经使美国帝国主义陷于狼狈地位。我们敬祝朝鲜人民争取独立自由和民主统一的正义战争，在全世界正义人民的热烈支援和朝鲜人民自己继续克服一切可能的困难，坚持战斗的条件下，获得最后胜利！朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
