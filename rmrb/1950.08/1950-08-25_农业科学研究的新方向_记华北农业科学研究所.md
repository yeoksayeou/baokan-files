　　New Directions in Agricultural Scientific Research
    ——A Record of the North China Agricultural Science Institute
    By Our Reporter Bai Sheng

    The North China Agricultural Science Institute is an agricultural scientific research institution directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. It assists farmers in improving agricultural production techniques, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, and promoting improved varieties, and is loved by farmers. The predecessor of this institute was the "Central Agricultural Experiment Station" during the Japanese occupation period (later renamed the North China Agricultural Experiment Station), which was formed by the Japanese invaders in 1938 to plunder resources from North China. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang reactionary government's "Central Agricultural Experiment Institute," "Central Forestry Experiment Institute," "Central Animal Husbandry Experiment Institute," and "North China Veterinary Disease Prevention Office," etc., separately took over its agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, and veterinary parts, resulting in a major division, which caused great losses to the entire research work. After the liberation of Beijing, the former North China People's Government, in order to establish agricultural scientific research work in New China, merged the above-mentioned institutions and the puppet Hebei Agricultural Improvement Institute in April 1949 to establish the North China Agricultural Science Institute.

    The institute's research departments are divided into eight departments and twenty-two research offices, including crops, horticulture, agricultural physical chemistry, plant diseases and insect pests, forestry, applied botany, livestock epidemic prevention, and animal husbandry. Among them, the Department of Applied Botany was newly established after liberation to strengthen the research of the Michurin theory. In addition, there is also a promotion committee, which mainly focuses on the suburbs of Beijing to carry out agricultural extension work, such as promoting improved varieties for farmers to choose.

    Since liberation, this institute has begun to embark on the road of combining with practice and serving the vast number of farmers. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the institute's experimental research work was divorced from reality, and the experimental subjects were complicated, lacking planning, wasting manpower and material resources, and only had form, unable to solve any practical problems. At the same time, due to the existence of sectarianism among the researchers, they were separated from each other, resulting in the research work being unrelated to each other. After liberation, the People's Government cautiously took over the institute's legacy and carried out rectification in response to the previous undesirable phenomena. In the general direction, based on the actual situation, it put forward the slogans of "technology must be combined with the masses" and "research must be combined with practice," and in terms of work policy, it put forward the principles of "less but more refined" and "focus" in order to concentrate existing manpower and material resources to solve the most important practical problems at present. After rectification and political study by the researchers, the various research work have had a new beginning.

    First of all, in August and September last year, the institute sent more than 70 technical researchers who had undergone study and transformation to participate in the general survey and professional investigation of 212 villages in 84 counties of the five provinces of North China, which was presided over by the Ministry of Agriculture. This group of agricultural scientific researchers came into contact with the vast number of hard-working farmers for the first time and began to understand their living conditions and some of the pressing problems existing in the current rural areas of China. In the vast rural areas of the old liberated areas of North China, after the land reform, farmers generally had increased enthusiasm for production and urgently demanded to improve agricultural production techniques and prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. These realistic problems prompted these agricultural scientific researchers to recognize the reality, examine the serious disconnection from reality in their past research work, and unanimously demanded to turn the research work to the road of combining research with practice and truly serving farmers. At the same time, during the investigation in the countryside, they also discovered the wisdom and experience of farmers and their crop cultivation techniques, which made them deeply feel that they should learn from farmers, obtain valuable research materials from farmers, conduct research together with farmers, and help farmers summarize those experiences in theory, improve them, and promote their application.

    In order to absorb the wisdom and experience of farmers, the institute also hired five rural labor heroes, including Bi Eryun, a labor hero in the Taihang District, as honorary researchers of the institute. Deng Yu, a labor hero from Lugouqiao, was hired as a consultant for sweet potato seedling breeding. During the spring plowing season this year, farmers in various parts of North China enthusiastically hoped that the agricultural scientific researchers of the institute would go to the countryside to help them solve technical problems in agricultural production. The farmers kindly asked these agricultural scientific researchers for technology and methods. Recently, the institute's promotion committee invited turned-over farmers in the suburbs of Beijing and rural work cadres to hold a forum on the selection of autumn crops in the suburbs of Beijing. The farmers asked the institute's researchers to solve agricultural production technology problems, such as the prevention and control of wheat yellow rust.

    According to the decision of the National Agricultural Production Conference of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central Government, the institute's work plan for 1950 takes the experimental research on increasing grain and cotton production and solving the technical problems of cotton and wheat production as the main tasks. All other experimental research work is carried out around this goal. At the same time, the Department of Applied Botany is taken as the focus, and the research of the Michurin theory is started on the scale of the entire institute. Through practical experimental research, the outdatedness of the idealist Weissmann, Mendel and other theories and the correctness of the Michurin theory are proved.

    Under the task of increasing grain and cotton production, the institute currently focuses on the improvement of various crop varieties, soil fertilizers, as well as the research on disease and pest control methods and the breeding of draught animals. The research on wheat varieties focuses on the cultivation of winter wheat varieties with high yield and strong resistance to rust, millet focuses on the cultivation of varieties with high yield and resistance to downy mildew, corn focuses on the use of hybrid advantages to produce excellent hybrids, and selects early-maturing varieties with short growth periods, cotton focuses on the preservation of pure superior varieties and the cultivation of new hybrid varieties. Disease research focuses on wheat rust resistance and coarse grain crop resistance to smut and downy mildew. Insect pest focuses on the research on the control methods of main pests such as mole crickets, locusts, aphids, armyworms and the mass production of "666" insecticide. Soil fertilizer focuses on the determination of land fertility in North China. Animal husbandry mainly studies the breeding of Chinese fine breed draught animals.

    In addition, there are also some temporary blitzkrieg research tasks. For example, the wheat yellow rust in various parts of North China this year, the wheat leaf bees that occurred in the suburbs of Beijing in April, and the cotton bollworms found on the cotton bolls of the Shuangqiao Mechanized Farming School Farm in the suburbs of Beijing recently, the institute conducted timely investigations and research, and worked with the farmers to find solutions.

    Today, a new direction of research work has begun to be established in the North China Agricultural Science Institute, the old experimental research work that is divorced from reality has been transformed, and the researchers have begun to move towards this new research direction.

　　农业科学研究的新方向
    ——记华北农业科学研究所
    本报记者  柏生
    华北农业科学研究所，是在中央人民政府农业部直接领导下的农业科学研究机关，它协助农民改进农业生产技术，防治病虫害，推广优良品种，受到农民的爱护。这个研究所的前身是日寇侵占时期的“中央农事试验场”（后改名为华北农事试验场），是日寇为了掠夺华北资源，在一九三八年组成的。日寇投降后，国民党反动政府的“中央农业实验所”、“中央林业实验所”、“中央畜牧实验所”和“华北兽医防治处”等机关分别接收了她的农业、林业、畜牧、兽医等部分，来了一次大分割，使整个研究工作遭受了很大的损失。北京解放后，前华北人民政府为了建立新中国的农业科学研究工作，于一九四九年四月将以上各机关和伪河北农业改进所合并，成立了华北农业科学研究所。
    该所的研究部门分为农作物、园艺、农业理化、植物病虫害、森林、应用植物学、家畜防疫、畜牧等八个系二十二个研究室，其中应用植物学系是解放后为加强米邱林学说的研究而新设立的。此外还有一个推广委员会，主要是以北京郊区为重点，办理农业推广工作，如推广优良品种给农民选用等。
    从解放后，这研究所便开始走向与实际结合、为广大农民服务的道路。在国民党反动派统治时期，该所的试验研究工作都是与实际脱节的，且试验科目繁杂，缺乏计划，浪费人力物力，光有形式，不能解决任何实际问题。同时因为研究人员中存在着宗派思想，彼此分立，致使各项研究工作互不相关。解放后，人民政府审慎地接管了该所的遗产，并针对以往的不良现象，进行了整理。在总的方向上，根据实际情况提出了“技术必须与群众结合”“研究必须与实际结合”的口号，在工作方针上，则提出“少而精”和“有重点”的原则，以期集中现有人力物力解决当前最主要的实际问题。经过整理与研究人员的政治学习后，各项研究工作都有了新的开端。
    首先在去年八九月间，该所派了七十多位经过学习改造的技术研究人员，参加了农业部所主持的华北五省八十四县二百一十二个村的普查和专业调查工作。这批农业科学研究工作者，首次接触到广大的劳苦农民，开始了解他们的生活情况和中国目前农村中存在着的一些迫切问题。在华北老解放区广大的农村中，农民在土改以后，因为生产情绪普遍提高，迫切要求改进农业生产技术，防治病虫灾害。这些现实问题，促使这些农业科学研究工作者认识了实际，检查了自己过去的研究工作严重脱离实际的情形，一致要求把研究工作转到研究与实际结合，确实为农民服务的道路上来。同时在下乡调查过程中，他们又发现了农民的智慧、经验、与作物栽培技术，使他们深深地感觉到自己要向农民学习，从农民那里取得宝贵的研究材料，与农民共同研究，并在理论上帮助农民总结那些经验，把它们提高一步推广应用。
    为了吸收农民的智慧与经验，该所并聘请了太行区劳动英雄毕二云等五位农村劳动英雄，作为研究所的名誉研究员。芦沟桥劳动英雄邓玉被聘为甘薯育苗的顾问。今年春耕期间，华北各地农民，便热烈地期望该所的农业科学研究工作者的下乡，帮助他们解决农业生产中的技术问题。农民们亲切地向这些农业科学研究工作者要技术、要办法。最近该所推广委员会邀请京郊翻身农民和农村工作干部举行京郊大秋作物选种问题座谈会，农民纷纷要求该所研究人员解决农业生产技术问题，如小麦黄锈病的防治等。
    根据中央农业部全国农业生产会议的决定，该所一九五○年的工作计划是以粮棉增产试验研究，和解决棉、麦生产技术问题为主要任务。其他一切试验研究工作均围绕这个目标进行。同时并以应用植物学系为重点，开始进行全所规模的米邱林学说的研究，通过实际试验研究，证明唯心主义的魏斯曼、孟德尔等学说的陈腐和米邱林学说的正确。
    在以粮棉增产为主的任务下，目前该所特别着重各种农作物品种、土壤肥料的改良，以及病虫害防治法的研究和耕畜的繁殖研究。小麦品种的研究，着重产量大，抗锈病强的冬小麦品种的培育，谷子着重在产量高而能抗白发病的品种的培育，玉米则着重利用杂交种的生长优势，以产生优良的杂交种，并且选育生长期短的早熟品种，棉花则着重优良品种的保纯和新杂交品种的培育。病害研究着重麦类抗锈病和杂粮作物抗黑穗病及白发病。虫害则着重研究主要害虫蝼蛄、蝗虫、蚜虫、行军虫的防治法和“六六六”杀虫药剂的大量制造。土壤肥料则着重华北地区地力的测定。畜牧则主要研究中国良种耕畜的繁殖等。
    此外，还有一些临时突击性的研究工作，譬如今年华北各地的小麦黄锈病，今年四月京郊发生的麦叶蜂，以及最近京郊双桥机耕学校农场棉铃上发现的棉铃虫等，该所都及时的进行了调查和研究，跟农民们一起想办法来解决。
    今天研究工作的新方向已经在华北农业科学研究所里开始确立起来，旧的脱离实际的实验研究工作已经在转变，研究人员已经开始向着这个新的研究方向前进。
