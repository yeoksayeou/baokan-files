　　Hebei Province Completes First Half Tax Revenue Target
    Breaking with Past Practice of Tax Revenue Declines in Off-Season
    [Baoding Dispatch] Hebei Province's tax revenue target for the first half of the year, with the exception of taxes on private industry and commerce, was completed according to the planned schedule by the end of June. Among them, the income in the second quarter increased, breaking the old practice of reduced tax revenue in the off-season.
    According to statistics, the completion of various tax revenues in the province accounted for 42.51 percent of the total annual tax revenue target, exceeding the planned collection of 40.22 percent by 2.29 percent. Among them, temporary commercial tax increased more than doubled in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, stamp tax increased by one time, goods tax increased by 50 percent, and transaction tax increased by 16 percent. This broke the traditional pattern of income decreasing in the second quarter compared to the first, and successfully navigated the tax revenue off-season.
    The reasons for the above achievements are, first of all, the importance attached by party and government leaders at all levels and the improvement of cadres' ideological understanding. When collecting industrial and commercial taxes, all relevant departments cooperated and participated, basically achieving a situation where everyone was involved in taxation. Secondly, the tax bureau structure and personnel at all levels have been substantially strengthened, and tax revenue agencies have been established in various market towns and key villages. After February and March, the markets were gradually cleaned up, stamp tax and transaction tax were rectified, and loopholes were plugged in a planned way, so that tax evasion was relatively reduced. Furthermore, experiences were exchanged in a timely manner through various meetings, which facilitated the development of the work. At the same time, the implementation of a daily remittance system played a role in promoting the work.

　　河北省完成上半年税收任务
    打破淡季税收减少旧例
    【本报保定讯】河北省上半年税收任务，到六月底除私营工商业税外，均已按照预定计划完成；其中第二季收入增多，打破了淡季税收减少的旧例。
    据统计，该省各项税收完成数占全年税收总任务的百分之四十二点五一，较预定征齐百分之四十点二二超过百分之二点二九；其中临时商业税二季比一季增加两倍以上，印花税增加一倍，货物税增加百分之五十，交易税增加百分之十六。打破了历来二季比一季收入减少的规律，度过了税收淡季。
    上述成绩出现的原因，首先是各级党政领导干部的重视与干部思想认识的提高；征收工商税时，各有关部门均协力参加，基本上做到了大家办税。其次是各级税局机构，人员已较充实，各集镇及重点乡村成立了税收机构；二、三月后并陆续清理了市场，整顿了印花税、交易税，有计划地堵塞了漏洞，使漏税相对减少。再就是通过不同的会议及时交流了经验，便利了工作的开展；同时，实行了日报解款制度，对工作起了推动作用。
