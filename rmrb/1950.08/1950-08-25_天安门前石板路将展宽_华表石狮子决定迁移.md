　　Tiananmen Square Stone Pavement to be Widened
　　Ornamental Columns and Stone Lions to be Relocated

　　[From Our Newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The construction of the tree-lined avenue, thanks to the active efforts of workers in the capital, has maintained its scheduled progress despite continuous heavy rain and is expected to be completed by mid-September. Currently, the Tiananmen Square renovation project is underway. In order to allow the marching masses to approach the Tiananmen review stand more closely during grand commemorative days, and to facilitate the rapid passage of more people, it is essential to widen the original stone pavement and appropriately adjust the environment in front of Tiananmen. It has now been decided to widen the original stone pavement to the edge of the five-arch bridge in front of Tiananmen. The two ornamental columns and stone lions in front of the five-arch bridge will also be moved diagonally backward, and the stone lions behind the five-arch bridge will be moved at the same time to maintain symmetry with those in front of the bridge. This move has been carefully considered. The Central Ministry of Culture's Cultural Relics Arrangement Committee, the Municipal Construction Bureau, and the Urban Planning Committee convened a meeting on the 23rd to study relocation methods to avoid damage during the move. The relocation project will be undertaken by Xu Rong, a craftsman specializing in festive decorations. Xu Rong is an experienced craftsman in the city and has considerable confidence in relocating cultural relics and historical sites. The relocation of the ornamental columns will be carried out in four steps, with stonemasons and decoration craftsmen taking charge respectively: first, the decoration craftsman will erect scaffolding to lift the ornamental column, then the stonemason will remove the ornamental column, then carefully move it, and then the stonemason will install it at the new site. The ornamental columns will be entirely wrapped in straw ropes, with 3.5-inch wooden boards sandwiched outside, and then glue will be added until the relocation is completed and removed. The relocation of the stone lions will also be carried out very carefully using lifting chains.

　　Ornamental columns and stone lions are all accessories to great architecture, and there is no fixed system for their placement. The ornamental columns and stone lions in front of Tiananmen were placed by past feudal emperors as decorations on the sides of gates and bridges to show their authority. The Tiananmen Grand Review Stand is planned to be rebuilt soon, and the new arrangement of ornamental columns and stone lions will be more fitting, beautiful, and more spectacular than before. The relocation of ornamental columns and stone lions, under the government's careful construction and protection, should not be damaged.

　　天安门前石板路将展宽
    华表石狮子决定迁移
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：林荫大道的修筑工程在首都工人们的积极努力下，虽然遭遇不断的大雨，也保持了预定的进度，可以在九月中旬完工。现正进行天安门前广场的整顿工程。为了在盛大纪念日使游行群众能靠近天安门检阅台和便于更多的群众能迅速地通过，展宽原有石板路和将天安门前的环境进行适当的调整是非常必要的。现已决定将原有石板路展宽到天安门前的五道桥边，突出五道桥前的两个华表和石狮子也决定向后斜方迁移，五道桥后面的石狮子为了和桥前保持对称也同时移动。这一举动是经过慎重考虑的。中央文化部文物整理委员会、市建设局和都市计划委员会为避免迁移时遭受破损，曾于二十三日集会，研究迁移办法。迁移工程将交由扎彩匠徐荣做。徐荣是本市有经验的扎彩匠，对文物古迹的迁移有相当的把握。此次华表的迁移，将分四个步骤，由石匠、扎彩匠分别负责：先由扎彩匠扎架把华表吊起，再由石匠把华表撤出，然后慎重挪移，再由石匠安置新址。华表全部用草绳包扎，外夹三寸半木板，外面再加鳔，直到移置完毕拆去。石狮的迁移也将很慎重地用吊链挪移。
    华表和石狮子都是伟大建筑的附属品，放的位置没有一定的制度，天安门前的华表和石狮是过去封建帝王为表示自己的威严，放在门洞和桥两边做装饰品。天安门大检阅台拟于近期改建，届时华表石狮新的布置将更能恰如其分的显得更美丽，更较前壮观。华表和石狮的迁移在政府的慎重施工和保护之下，当不致有所损坏。
