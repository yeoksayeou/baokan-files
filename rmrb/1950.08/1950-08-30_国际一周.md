    Be Vigilant Against America's New Aggression Conspiracy
    American imperialism is carrying out a new aggression conspiracy, interfering in China's internal affairs, infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty, and attempting to expand its aggressive war already begun in Korea.
    After our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai requested the Security Council on the 24th to impose sanctions on the United States for its aggression against our territory of Taiwan and to take immediate measures to completely withdraw its aggressive forces from Taiwan and other Chinese territories, the US representative to the Security Council, Austin, sent a letter to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 25th. In this letter, in addition to sophistry for the United States' aggression against Taiwan and spreading the lie that "the United States has not invaded Chinese territory," Austin also stated that "the actual status of the island (referring to Taiwan) is that it is a territory received from Japan as a result of the Allied victory in the Pacific. Like other such areas, its legal status cannot be determined until international action is taken to decide its future." On the same day, a US State Department spokesperson also publicly announced: "The United States would welcome the United Nations to consider the Taiwan issue." However, Austin's letter and the US State Department spokesperson's statement only exposed the despicable, rogue, and shameful characteristics of the American aggressors. As everyone knows, for thousands of years, Taiwan has been an integral part of China's sacred territory. The Cairo Declaration of December 1, 1943, signed by the US President himself, and the Potsdam Proclamation of July 26, 1945, clearly stipulate the words "Taiwan shall be returned to China." Even Truman himself, in his statement on January 5 this year, could not but admit that "territories seized from China by Japan, such as Taiwan, should be returned to China." Therefore, the so-called status of Taiwan has long been determined. The United Nations has no right to consider the status of China's territory of Taiwan. What the United Nations has the right to consider and must consider is the criminal issue of US imperialism's unreasonable aggression against Chinese territory and interference in China's internal affairs. The American aggressors' proposal of so-called "international action to decide" or "United Nations consideration" is not only an unreasonable act of tearing up previous international agreements, but also a vicious conspiracy to attempt to hang a legal sign on the aggression against Taiwan.
    At the same time, American imperialism is carrying out new provocations against the Chinese people. Military aircraft of the US aggressive forces in Korea repeatedly intruded into our northeast airspace on August 27, strafing, killing three of our compatriots and injuring twenty-one. This new provocative act by the US Air Force of invading Chinese airspace and strafing the Chinese people, as pointed out by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai in his telegram to the Security Council, "is a serious crime of infringing upon China's sovereignty, killing Chinese people, and attempting to expand the war and undermine peace." All Chinese people must be highly vigilant and rise up in unison to resolutely oppose the preposterous acts of the United States in invading Chinese territory and airspace and interfering in China's internal affairs, and prepare to work for the liberation of Taiwan and all the motherland's territory from the American aggressors. The Chinese people, who have already achieved great victories, have the confidence and the strength to defeat all the aggressive conspiracies of US imperialism.
    Korean People Valiantly Advance
    The Korean people's liberation war against the American aggressors and their running dog, the Syngman Rhee puppet regime, has entered its third month. In the fierce fighting of the past two months, the heroic Korean People's Army, with the united support of the entire Korean people, repelled the sudden invasion of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, shattered the American aggressors' "quick victory" plan, liberated 90 percent of the territory in the southern half of the Republic and 92 percent of the people in the southern half. In the course of the two months of combat, the heroic Korean People's Army killed, wounded, and captured more than 80,000 American and Rhee soldiers, annihilated the main force of the Syngman Rhee puppet army, annihilated the US Army 24th Division, and inflicted devastating blows on the US Army 25th Division. In terms of naval and air forces, the Korean People's Army also inflicted huge losses on the enemy. The Korean people have won brilliant victories in the glorious war for national independence and freedom.
    However, as General Kim Il-sung pointed out in his report at the "August 15th" Pyongyang celebration, the great victories already achieved by the Korean people are not yet final victories. The more the enemy's aggressive intentions are frustrated, the more they will carry out bestial struggles. The war to finally eliminate the enemy from Korean territory has now entered a more fierce and arduous stage. In a small bridgehead in the southeast corner of Korea, the American aggressors have increased their forces to five divisions and two regiments, and are using the method of frantically drafting men in the occupied areas to supplement the remaining puppet army of Syngman Rhee, acting as cannon fodder in combat. Under the cover of numerically superior aircraft and a large number of tanks, the US military has recently launched frantic local counterattacks on the Masan front on the south coast, the Waegwan front, and other areas, attempting to stop the advance of the Korean People's Army and maintain its bridgehead based on Daegu, Busan, Jinhae, and Masan. In the rear of Korea, US aircraft and fleets continue to carry out inhuman indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities and villages, blindly massacring peaceful residents, causing thousands upon thousands of women and children to suffer the pain of broken families and deaths. In the war zones near the front lines, American aggressors set fire to houses when they see them, and shoot at pedestrians. Even masses of refugees are not spared. The brutal atrocities of the American aggressors in violation of international law are even worse than those of the German and Japanese fascists.
    However, the American aggressors' attempt to achieve their aggressive goals through such appalling atrocities is doomed to failure. The inhuman atrocities of the US military have aroused international outrage. The people of China, the Soviet Union, the various People's Democratic countries, and many capitalist countries have issued strong protests. The United Nations headquarters has currently received more than 3,500 protest letters and telegrams from international organizations and various people's groups from all over the world. The sympathy of the people of the world is on the side of the Korean people, and the hatred of the people of the world is directed at US imperialism. The atrocities of the US military have also ignited even more intense anger among the 30 million people of Korea, and aroused the Korean People's Army's more determined will to kill the enemy. The People's Army is repelling enemy counterattacks on all fronts and continuing its offensive. On the Jinju line front alone, in the ten days from August 2 to August 12, the People's Army killed, wounded, and captured more than 6,000 enemies in crushing the attacks of the US 25th Division and the 1st Marine Division. The entire Korean people, under the slogan of "Everything for the front," "Everything for victory," are uniting into an iron giant, valiantly advancing to completely drive out the American aggressors and strive for the final victory of the liberation war.

    警惕美国的新侵略阴谋
    美国帝国主义正在实行新的侵略阴谋，干涉中国内政，侵犯中国领土主权，并企图借此扩大其已在朝鲜开始的侵略战争。
    在我国周恩来外长于二十四日向安理会要求制裁美国侵略我国领土台湾，并立即采取措施使美国政府自台湾及中国其他领土完全撤出它的侵略部队以后，美国驻安理会代表奥斯汀，即于二十五日致函联合国秘书长赖伊。奥斯汀在这封信中，除了为美国侵略台湾的行为进行狡辩，和散布“美国并未侵犯中国领土”的谎言以外，还说什么“该岛（按指台湾）实际地位，是它是一块由于盟军在太平洋的胜利而从日本手里接收过来的领土。像其他这样的地域一样，它的合法地位，在国际上采取行动决定它的前途之前，是不能确定的。”同日，美国国务院发言人也公开宣布：“美国将欢迎联合国考虑台湾问题。”可是，奥斯汀的信和美国务院发言人的声明，只是暴露了美国侵略者卑鄙无赖和可耻的流氓特性。尽人皆知，几千年来，台湾就是中国神圣领土的一部分。有美国总统亲手签字的一九四三年十二月一日的开罗宣言，和一九四五年七月二十六日的波茨坦公告的白纸黑字，也明明白白地规定着“台湾归还中国”的字样。甚至连杜鲁门本人在今年一月五日的声明中，也不能不承认“日本自中国夺去的领土如台湾，应当归还中国。”因此，所谓台湾的地位，已经早被确定，联合国无权考虑中国领土台湾的什么地位问题，联合国有权考虑和必须考虑的，是美帝国主义无理侵略中国领土和干涉中国内政的犯罪问题。美国侵略者提出所谓“国际上采取行动决定”或“联合国考虑”，不仅是撕毁历次的国际协定的无理行为，而且是妄想借此为侵略台湾挂上一块合法招牌的险毒阴谋。
    美帝国主义同时又向中国人民实行新的挑衅。美国侵略朝鲜军队的军用飞机，在八月二十七日连续多次侵入我国东北领空扫射，使我同胞死三人，伤二十一人。美国空军的这一侵入中国领空并扫射中国人民的新的挑衅行为，正如我周恩来外长在致安理会的电文中所指出的，“是侵犯中国主权，残杀中国人民，并企图扩大战争和破坏和平的严重罪行”。全中国人民必须严重警惕和一致奋起，坚决反对美国侵犯中国领土、领空和干涉中国内政的悖谬行为，准备为从美国侵略者手中解放台湾和一切祖国的领土而努力。已经取得了伟大胜利的中国人民，有信心而且有力量打败美帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋。
    朝鲜人民奋勇前进
    朝鲜人民反对美国侵略者及其走狗李承晚傀儡的解放战争，已进入第三个月。在两个多月来的激烈战争中，英勇的朝鲜人民军在全朝鲜人民一致的支持下，击退了李承晚伪军的突然进犯，粉碎了美国侵略者的“速胜”计划，解放了共和国南半部百分之九十的地区和占南半部总人口百分之九十二的人民。英勇的朝鲜人民军在两月来的作战过程中，打死、打伤与俘掳了美、李军队八万余人，歼灭了李承晚伪军的基本主力，歼灭了美陆军第二十四师，并予美陆军第二十五师以毁灭性的打击。在海、空军方面，朝鲜人民军也给了敌人以巨大的损失。朝鲜人民在争取祖国独立、自由的光荣战争中，已赢得了辉煌的胜利。
    然而，正如金日成将军在“八、一五”平壤庆祝大会上的报告中所指出的，朝鲜人民已经取得的巨大胜利，还不是终局性的胜利。敌人侵略的意图越受挫折，就越会进行兽性的挣扎。从朝鲜领土上最后肃清敌人的战争，现已进入更激烈、更艰苦的阶段。在朝鲜东南一隅的狭小桥头阵地中，美国侵略者已将其兵力增加到五个师又两个团，并在占领区以疯狂抓丁的办法来补充李承晚的残余伪军，充当它在作战中的炮灰。在数量上占优势的飞机与大量坦克的掩护下，美军最近已在南海岸马山前线、倭馆前线及其他地区，进行疯狂的局部性反扑，力图阻止朝鲜人民军的前进，保持它以大邱、釜山、镇海、马山为据点的桥头阵地。在朝鲜后方，美国飞机与舰队对和平城市与乡村，继续进行惨无人道的滥炸，盲目地屠杀和平居民，使成千成万的妇女儿童，身受家破人亡的苦难。在接近前线的战区中，美国侵略者遇到房屋就纵火，见到行人就开枪，即使是难民群众，也不能幸免。美国侵略者违反国际公法的残暴兽行，实比德、日法西斯有过之而无不及。
    但是，美国侵略者企图以这种骇人听闻的暴行来达到侵略的目的，是注定要失败的。美军灭绝人性的暴行，已激起国际的公愤。中国、苏联、各人民民主国家以及许多资本主义国家的人民，已对此发出强烈的抗议。联合国总部目前收到的国际性组织和世界各国各种人民团体的抗议函电，已达三千五百多件。全世界人民的同情都在朝鲜人民方面，全世界人民的仇恨都指向美帝国主义。美军的暴行，同时也燃起了全朝鲜三千万人民更为炽烈的怒火，激起了朝鲜人民军更为坚决的杀敌意志。人民军在各个战线上，击退了敌人的反扑，继续着自己的进攻。仅在晋州线前线，在八月二日至十二日的十天中，人民军在粉碎美军第二十五师及海军陆战队第一师的进攻中，即打死、打伤与俘掳敌人六千余名。全朝鲜人民在“一切为了前线”，“一切为着胜利”的口号下，正团结成为一个钢铁的巨人，为完全驱逐美国侵略者，为争取解放战争的最后胜利，奋勇地前进着。
