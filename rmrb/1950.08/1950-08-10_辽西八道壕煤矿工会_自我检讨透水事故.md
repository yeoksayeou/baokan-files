Liaoxi Badaohao Coal Mine Trade Union
    Self-Criticism of the Water Inrush Accident

[Benbao Liaoxi News] The New No. 1 shaft of the Liaoxi Provincial Badaohao Coal Mine experienced a major water inrush accident at 10:15 am on March 27th at the No. 2 wind tunnel of the main unloading point, resulting in the drowning deaths of twenty-five fellow workers. After receiving assistance from the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and various other parties, the mine's trade union has conducted a profound self-criticism, acknowledging that the accident was inseparable from its failure to correctly grasp policies and its bureaucratic leadership style. The main errors are as follows:

    1. Incomplete and unclear understanding of policies and ideology. Firstly, there was a lack of comprehensive understanding of the trade union's role in production. While it was correct for the trade union to emphasize ensuring the completion of production tasks, it was wrong to blindly and isolatedly pursue production while neglecting safe production conditions. For example, New No. 1 shaft was operating recklessly in the old No. 2 tunnel below the horizontal line. In the No. 3 shaft, the area between the second and third slices of the main unloading point had been experiencing cave-ins for eight months, reaching a height of twenty meters due to a lack of pit props. The administration, in order to complete the task, mobilized workers to enter the pit at the risk of their lives (operations have now ceased for repairs). However, the mine's trade union turned a blind eye to these serious problems. At the same time, the trade union's safety education for workers was also poor. For instance, some workers were undermining the structural integrity by digging at the base of the walls, smoking, using matches to ignite explosives, digging out unexploded explosives with iron wire, and placing detonators and fuses in the same pocket, all of which are extremely dangerous and violate safety regulations. However, the trade union failed to grasp these specific facts and promptly educate workers on safety regulations and compliance with labor discipline. Secondly, the spirit of ensuring the completion of production tasks was not adequately understood, remaining merely at the level of verbal calls and mobilization, without mobilizing and organizing workers to participate in the formulation of plans. For example, the construction plan for New No. 1 shaft was not discussed by the masses. After the water inrush, some workers said, "If you had told us earlier that there was an old No. 2 tunnel below the No. 2 wind tunnel of the main unloading point, we would have been cautious."

    2. Lack of a viewpoint of uniting the entire working class. Failure to study technology, failure to study production operations, and failure to attach importance to the work of technical personnel and staff. There was a lack of unity between workers, technical personnel, and staff, which prevented the guiding role of advanced technology from being brought into play.

    3. Serious bureaucracy. Before the water inrush in New No. 1 shaft, the trade union director had heard at a meeting that the shaft was dangerous, but failed to immediately propose and coordinate with the administration to take effective measures. This kind of bureaucracy that does not care about the safety of workers' lives is extremely vile and serious.

In summary, the mine's trade union failed to grasp the comprehensive policy of "developing production, taking into account both public and private interests," and to implement the correct government decrees among the masses. It also suffered from serious bureaucracy, failing to raise or insist on correct opinions when encountering problems, even making unprincipled concessions, as well as engaging in disorganized and undisciplined behavior without reporting or requesting instructions, which led to this serious consequence. In addition to self-criticism, the trade union requests that the higher-level trade union impose a penalty.

[Another dispatch] The Liaoxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions has also made a self-criticism regarding its responsibility for the water inrush accident in the New No. 1 shaft of the Badaohao Coal Mine. First, it admits that the provincial federation's policy thinking was unclear. In the past, its leadership emphasized production, which was correct, but it did not pay enough attention to workers' safety, equipment, and welfare. This on the one hand shows that the provincial federation did not conscientiously implement the instructions of the higher-level trade union, and also shows that the provincial federation has not yet established a clear understanding of relying on the working class to run the factory well. Therefore, the provincial federation bears major responsibility for the errors of the Badaohao Coal Mine Trade Union. Secondly, the provincial federation has engaged in bureaucracy in its leadership methods. It lacked concrete leadership and in-depth inspection, and in particular, it failed to use the method of focusing on key areas to summarize mature experiences and educate cadres in a timely manner.

### 辽西八道壕煤矿工会  自我检讨透水事故

　　辽西八道壕煤矿工会
    自我检讨透水事故
    【本报辽西讯】辽西省营八道壕煤矿新一坑于三月二十七日十时十五分，在本卸二风道爆发透水事故，淹死二十五名工友的重大事件，该矿工会经过省总与各方面的帮助，已作深刻检讨，认为这次事故的发生，和自己不能正确掌握政策，及官僚主义的领导作风是分不开的。主要错误有以下几点：
    一、政策思想不完全、不明确。这首先是对工会搞好生产，缺乏全面认识。工会强调保证完成生产任务是正确的，但只盲目地孤立地搞生产，而忽视了在安全条件下搞生产则是错误的。如新一坑是在水平线下的老二坑道上，盲目冒险作业；三坑本卸正下二片到三片间有三十米因缺坑木，从去年八月冒顶到现在已有二十米高，行政为完成任务，动员工人冒着生命危险进坑作业（现已停止作业进行修建）；但该矿工会对这些严重问题熟视无睹。同时，工会对工人的保安教育也差，如有的工人在坑内作业扒帮拉底，吸烟，用洋火放炮，炸药不响用铁丝挖，雷管和导火线放在一个口袋里等等，都是十分危险和违反保安规程的。而工会却没能掌握这些具体事实，抓紧对工人进行保安规程及遵守劳动纪律的教育。其次，对保证完成生产任务的精神也领会的不够，只是停留于口头上的号召和动员，并没有发动和组织工人参加制订计划。如新一坑的修建计划就没有经过群众的讨论。透水后有的工友说：“假如你们早告诉我们本卸二风道下有老二坑的话，我们怎样也得试探着干。”
    二、缺乏团结全体工人阶级的观点。不研究技术，不研究生产业务，没有重视对技术人员与职员的工作。工人与技术人员、职员之间存在着不团结现象，因此不能发挥先进技术的指导作用。
    三、严重的官僚主义。新一坑透水前，工会主任在某次会议上曾听到该坑危险，但并未立即建议和协同行政采取有效措施，这种不关心工人生命安全的官僚主义是极端恶劣与严重的。
    总之，该矿工会由于没掌握了全面的“发展生产公私兼顾”政策，把正确的政府法令贯彻到群众中去；和本身存在着严重的官僚主义，遇到问题不能提出或坚持正确意见，甚至无原则的迁就；及既不报告也不请示的无组织无纪律行为，因此产生了这一严重的恶果。该工会除检讨外，并请上级工会予以处分。
    【又讯】辽西省总工会对八道壕煤矿新一井透水事故的责任也作了自我检讨。首先承认省总的政策思想是不明确的。在领导上过去强调了生产是对的，但对工人安全设备福利事业则注意不够。这一方面表现出省总没有认真执行上级工会的指示，同时也说明省总还没有树立起明确的依靠工人阶级办好工厂的思想。因此八道壕煤矿工会的错误，省总在领导上亦负有重大责任。二、省总在领导方法上有官僚主义。缺乏具体的领导与深入的检查，特别是没有运用重点领导的方法，因此不能及时总结成熟的经验教育干部。
