　　Reasonable Adjustment of Wholesale and Retail Prices
    Northeast Trade Department Formulates Differential Rates
    (Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 29th) In order to further facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government has formulated reasonable differential rates between the wholesale and retail prices of state-owned commercial enterprises, and will periodically adjust them based on actual implementation in the future.
    The main principle of the differential rates formulated by the Northeast Trade Department is to ensure that producers, transporters, and consumers all receive their due benefits. Considering the various different situations of private merchants and state-owned stores, state-owned commercial enterprises calculated the standard of average business in private industrial and commercial enterprises. Based on this, the differential rates between wholesale and retail prices of state-owned commercial enterprises were formulated, so that private merchants, after receiving wholesale goods, could still obtain a certain amount of net profit after deducting expenses such as commodity transportation, losses, management expenses, and business tax and income tax payable. Cooperatives that truly serve their members and do not aim to distribute profits will be given preferential treatment of 1.5% lower than the general wholesale price, considering their difficulties of insufficient funds and personnel.
    In order to ensure that all industries can benefit and avoid the phenomenon of unbalanced profits, the difference between wholesale and retail prices is determined according to the turnover rate of various commodities and the actual situation of operating expenses, and is divided into twenty-four categories according to the type of commodity. Among them, the differential rates for eight main commodities are: yarn (bundle) cloth (bolt) 5.47%, general merchandise (shoes, socks, and other daily necessities) 7.25%, relatively valuable merchandise (pens, glasses, cosmetics, etc.) 8.47%, grain (jin) 6.65%, soybean oil (jin) 6%, flour (bag) 5.9%, edible salt (jin) 6.47%, and raw coal (ton) 16.6%.

　　合理调整批发零售价格
    东北贸易部制定差价率
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】东北人民政府贸易部为了进一步沟通城乡物资交流，已制订国营商业批发价格与零售价格间的合理差价率，并将根据以后实际执行情况，定期加以调整。
    东北贸易部制订差价率的主要精神，在于使生产者、贩运者、消费者都能得到应有利益。国营商业考虑到私商与国营商店各种不同的情况，计算出私营工商业中等营业的标准，据此制订了国营商业批发和零售间的差价率，使得私商在受领批发后，除去商品运输、损耗、管理开支等费用，及应缴营业税、所得税外，还能得到一定数量的纯利。对真正为社员服务，不以分红为目的的合作社，则照顾其资金、人员不足的困难，予以低于一般批发价百分之一点五的优待。
    为使各业都能获益，避免利润不均衡的现象，批发与零售的价格差额，是根据各种不同商品的周转速度，经营开支的实际情况，按照商品的类别，分为二十四类来确定的。其中八种主要商品的差价率为：纱（捆）布（匹）百分之五点四七，一般百货（鞋袜等日用品）百分之七点二五，较为贵重的百货（钢笔、眼镜、化妆品等）百分之八点四七，粮食（斤）百分之六点六五，豆油（斤）百分之六，面粉（袋）百分之五点九，食盐（斤）百分之六点四七，原煤（吨）百分之十六点六。
