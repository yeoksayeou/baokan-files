　　Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: The United States House of Representatives on the 10th, and the Senate on the 21st, respectively passed two largely identical economic control bills, placing the US economy under a war mobilization state of dictatorial power granted to Truman. According to the United States Information Service, both bills, in accordance with the requests in Truman's message on July 19th, stipulate that the President has the right to restrict wages, implement rationing, control prices, requisition factories and equipment "necessary for national defense," expand military production, establish a priority system, and invest basic materials into military production whenever he deems it appropriate. According to these two bills, Truman can arbitrarily lower the people's living standards at any time, use legal means to suppress the legitimate demands of workers to improve their lives by raising wages, and concentrate the country's resources for expanding aggressive war.
    There are some minor differences between the two bills. According to the House bill, the President has greater freedom in exercising the above dictatorial powers than under the Senate bill. The two bills are now awaiting adjustment by a joint conference committee of both houses and will soon be submitted to Truman for signature and implementation.

　　美两院通过经济管制法案授予杜鲁门经济独裁大权
    【新华社二十四日讯】美国众议院于十日，参议院于二十一日，分别通过两项大体上相同的经济管制法案，把美国经济置于战争动员状态的独裁大权授予杜鲁门。据美国新闻处消息，这两项法案均按照杜鲁门七月十九日咨文中的要求，规定总统有权在他认为合宜时限制工资，实施配给，管制物价，征发“国防所需”的工厂与设备，扩充军事生产，建立优先制度，把基本物资投入军事生产等等。根据这两项法案，杜鲁门得随时任意降低人民的生活水平，用法律手段来压制工人为改善生活而提高工资的正当要求，并把国家的资源集中供扩大侵略战争之用。
    在这两项法案间存在着一些次要的分歧，按照众院的法案，总统在行使上项独裁权力时，有较参院法案更大的自由。该两法案现正待两院联席会议委员会予以调整后，即将交由杜鲁门签署实行。
