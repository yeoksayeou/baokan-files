　　Northeast Greater Administrative Region Level Leading Organs and Provinces/Cities
    Rectification Enters Inspection Phase
    [Report from our newspaper special correspondent Li Huang]: The rectification movement in the Northeast greater administrative region level leading organs and provinces/cities began successively from July and has now been initially launched, with most units entering the inspection phase. Some units have already identified the main shortcomings in their past work, learned from experience, and begun to study ways to improve future work, achieving preliminary results. Some units also have deviations that need to be corrected.
  Basic Situation of Ideological Style of Northeast Cadres
    Based on the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's directives on party rectification, the Northeast Bureau specifically studied the ideology and work style of Northeast cadres, believing that the more serious problems currently are the low policy level of cadres and their lack of skill in using the mass line working method. Leading organs tend to focus on making arrangements, with insufficient inspection, being busy with daily work but failing to grasp the main tasks and implement them thoroughly in terms of policy. Therefore, the shortcomings and errors in work are mainly manifested as insufficient policy viewpoints and overall concepts, with a simplistic task-oriented perspective. Often, in order to complete tasks, the tasks are viewed as being in opposition to policy; also, often in order to complete the specific tasks of their own departments, they fail to integrate well with the overall tasks. For example, in the industrial sector, many factories and mines only focus on completing tasks without considering costs and quality; particularly basic construction projects generally have poor quality and are very wasteful. In order to complete the task of withdrawing currency from circulation, the trade departments sell goods at a loss; in procurement, they do not adhere to pricing policies and lack economic accounting. In tax collection work, some only pay attention to completing tasks without considering production; there are also uneven burdens. In agricultural production, there is a pursuit of the form and quantity of organization, and discrimination against individual households (those who do not participate in labor exchange and mutual aid groups). These situations and problems, due to the lack of timely and in-depth inspection by the leading organs, and the complacency of many veteran cadres, have not been discovered and resolved in a timely manner, resulting in losses in work.
    Rectification Content and Guidelines Determined by the Northeast Bureau
    Based on the above situation, the Northeast Bureau decided that the main content of the rectification is to examine the implementation of policies through the current main tasks, using the method of criticism and self-criticism; from the examination of policy implementation, to expose shortcomings, learn from experience, educate cadres, and transform work style, thereby improving the ideological policy level and mass viewpoint of cadres, in order to improve work and strengthen ties with the masses.
    Important Preparatory Work Before Starting Rectification
    According to this guideline, in addition to issuing two instructions successively, the Northeast Bureau also held a rectification symposium in late June, presided over personally by Comrade Gao Gang. The attendees were the responsible comrades of the party in the Northeast level leading organs. At the symposium, each unit first put forward the content of rectification, and then Comrade Gao Gang gave specific instructions based on their work situation. Regarding how rectification should examine the implementation of basic policies through current main tasks, in order to implement Chairman Mao's instruction of "closely integrating with various work tasks rather than separating from them," the responsible persons of each unit present had a clear understanding. At the cadre meeting commemorating the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party on July 1, Comrade Gao Gang made a mobilization report on rectification. These were important preparatory work before the formal start of rectification.
    Each Department Determines the Content and Focus of Rectification
    Now, the content and focus of rectification determined by each department according to its own specific situation are mostly in line with the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's instructions. For example: the Ministry of Industry focuses on examining business management, basic construction, product quality, unity with technical personnel, and leadership style; the Ministry of Trade mainly examines how to make plans accurately so as to link various economic factors together and make them all fit, as well as pricing policies, public-private relations, and economic accounting in business management; the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry focuses on examining water conservancy, the promotion of new agricultural tools, farms, animal husbandry, etc.; the Ministry of Finance focuses on examining the adjustment of burdens, how finance ensures production and construction, and how to implement supervision; the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions focuses on examining the unity of the entire working class, the implementation of the Trade Union Law, and how the trade union can deeply involve itself in production, etc.
    Focusing on Economic Construction as the Leading Focus of Rectification
    In order to understand the situation and study the problems in a timely manner, the Northeast Bureau established a Rectification Committee to guide the daily work of rectification. Since the central task of the Northeast is economic construction, and it has been going on for a year and a half, the leading focus of rectification is placed on economic construction; currently it is placed on industry and commerce. In order to make industrial construction and commercial work adapt to objective needs and embark on a new stage, the Northeast Bureau decided to convene rectification meetings for these two types of work to solve the main problems for their forward development. The industrial rectification meeting was held from August 2nd to 9th. The meeting criticized the supply system thinking of having no cost concept and simply completing production quantity; it preliminarily solved from the ideological and policy levels how to unite the entire working class in state-owned enterprises, improve the operation and management of state-owned enterprises, so as to reduce costs, improve quality, and overcome waste. The commercial rectification meeting is scheduled to be held at the end of August.
    Due to the different levels of understanding of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Northeast Bureau by the leaders in various places, there are roughly three situations in the Northeast's rectification movement:
    Many Departments Have Found the Main Problems and Proposed Improvement Measures
    The first situation is relatively good. The leaders have a clear understanding of the rectification guidelines, combined with the current main tasks, and through analysis and research, they have identified the main problems existing in their departments, inspired cadres to conduct democratic inspection from the policy level, promote criticism and self-criticism, find the root causes of shortcomings, and propose improvement measures. After rectification, some ideological problems have indeed been resolved, cadres' morale is high, and their understanding of policies and confidence in work have been improved. For example, the industrial rectification meeting and the Ministry of Trade, in conjunction with the ordering of the fourth quarter and next year's plans, conducted an inspection of the shortcomings and deviations in commercial and various economic relations, especially public-private relations, pricing policies, and business management, thereby preliminarily clarifying several basic policy issues of commercial work. Another example is the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, which convened an executive committee meeting, combined with ordering the second half of the year's work plan, inspected that the past understanding of uniting the entire working class was insufficient, the education on strengthening the working class's sense of responsibility was insufficient, and the implementation of the task of centering on production was insufficient, and proposed improvement measures, which will play an active role in improving future trade union work. Another example is that the responsible persons of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry went to the front line to inspect water conservancy, new agricultural tools, forestry, farms, and other work, discovered problems, resolved them immediately when possible, and stipulated systems.
    There are Also Some Units Where Two Deviations Exist That Should Be Immediately Reversed
    The second situation is to carry out rectification with a bureaucratic and formalistic attitude. Instead of finding the main problems according to their own specific situation to inspire cadres to conduct a review from the policy level, they use the old methods of reading documents, writing self-reflection notes, and holding empty discussion meetings. As a result, criticism and self-criticism have not been launched, the current main problems have not been specifically resolved, and cadres' morale towards rectification is not high. The Northeast Bureau has instructed various places to correct this deviation.
    The third situation is that the leaders have not clearly recognized the rectification guidelines and focus. Some are rectifying relationships in isolation; some are vaguely rectifying work style; some are generally rectifying corruption; some are mechanically separating criticism and self-criticism, only calling on cadres to criticize leaders, without inspiring cadres to self-criticize, so that they deviate from the current main tasks and basic policies, entangling principled issues with trivial matters of life, everyone complains, right and wrong are not distinguished, responsibilities are unclear, and the leadership falls into a passive position, causing ideological confusion. Regarding this deviation, the Northeast Bureau instructed: it should be immediately reversed. First, the leaders should conduct self-criticism on the errors in grasping the rectification guidelines, guide everyone to the correct track of rectification, and then put forward the current main problems and organize everyone to conduct democratic inspection.

　　东北大行政区级各领导机关及省市
    整风进入检查工作阶段
    【本报讯】本报特约记者李荒报道：东北级各领导机关及省市的整风运动，从七月份起先后开始，现已初步展开，大都进入检查工作阶段。若干单位已发现了过去工作中主要缺点，找出经验，并着手研究改进今后工作的办法，初步收到成效。也有若干单位存在偏差有待纠正。
  东北干部思想作风基本情况
    东北局根据中共中央整党指示，具体研究了东北干部的思想和作风，认为目前较严重的问题，是干部政策水平低和不善于运用群众路线的工作方法。领导机关则多是布置多，检查少，忙于日常工作，而未抓住主要工作，从政策上使它贯彻到底。因而工作中缺点与错误，主要表现为政策观点和整体观念不足，存在单纯任务观点。往往为了完成任务而把任务与政策对立看待；又往往为了完成本部门的具体任务而不能和总任务很好结合。如在工业部门中，有不少厂矿，只知完成任务而不计成本和质量；特别是基本的建设工程，一般是质量很差，浪费很大。贸易部门为了完成回笼任务，赔本卖货；在收购中不讲价格政策，缺乏经济核算。税收工作中有的只注意完成任务，而不照顾生产；负担上也有畸轻畸重现象。农业生产中追求组织起来的形式和数量，歧视单干户（不参加换工互助组者）。这些情况和问题，由于领导机关缺乏及时的深入的检查，及许多老干部存在自满情绪，以致未能及时发现与解决，从而造成了工作中的损失。
    东北局决定的整风内容方针
    根据以上情况，东北局决定：整风主要内容是通过当前主要工作，以开展批评与自我批评的方法，检查政策执行情形；从检查政策执行情形中，揭发缺点，吸取经验，教育干部，转变作风，从而提高干部的思想政策水平和群众观点，以达到改进工作，密切与群众联系的目的。
    开始整风前的重要准备工作
    根据这一方针，东北局除先后发出两次指示外，并于六月下旬召开一次整风座谈会，由高岗同志亲自主持。到会者有东北级各领导机关的党的负责同志。座谈会上，先由各单位提出整风内容，然后由高岗同志针对其工作情况给予具体指示。对整风如何通过当前主要工作来检查基本政策执行情况，以贯彻毛主席的“和各项工作任务密切地相结合而不是相分离”的指示，使到会各单位负责人有了明确的认识。七月一日纪念中共诞辰的干部会上，高岗同志又作了整风动员报告。这些是正式开始整风前的重要准备工作。
    各部门确定整风内容与重点
    现在，各部门按照其本身具体情况所确定的整风内容与重点，多数是符合于东北局指示的精神的。如：工业部以检查经营管理、基本建设、产品质量、团结技术人员和领导作风为主；贸易部主要的是检查计划如何做得准确以便把各种经济联结起来，使之各得其所，以及价格政策、公私关系、经营管理中的经济核算等；农林部以检查水利、推广新农具、农场畜产等为主；财政部以检查调整负担、财政如何保证生产建设并如何实行监督为主；东北总工会以检查团结全体工人阶级、贯彻工会法、工会如何深入生产等为主。
    以经济建设为整风领导重点
    为了及时了解情况，研究问题，东北局成立了整风委员会，指导整风的日常工作。由于东北中心任务是经济建设，并已进行了一年半时间，因此将整风领导的重点，放在经济建设上；目前放在工业和商业上面。为了使工业建设与商业工作适应客观需要，走上一个新的阶段，东北局决定召开此两种工作的整风会议，解决其向前发展的主要问题。工业整风会议，已于八月二日到九日举行完毕。会议批判了没有成本观念、单纯完成生产数量的供给制思想；初步从思想上、政策上解决了如何团结公营企业中全体工人阶级，改进公营企业经营管理，以减低成本，提高质量，克服浪费。商业整风会议预定八月底召开。
    东北的整风运动，由于各地领导上对中共中央和东北局指示了解有深有浅，因而大体上有三种情况：
    不少部门已经找出主要问题提出改进办法
    第一种是比较好的，领导上对整风方针明确，结合了当前主要工作，经过分析研究，找出本部门存在的主要问题，启发干部从政策上展开民主检查，发扬批评与自我批评，找出缺点根源，提出改进办法。整风后确实解决了一些思想问题，干部情绪饱满，提高了对政策认识与工作信心。如工业整风会议及贸易部结合订第四季度和明年计划，对商业与各种经济关系特别是公私关系，价格政策，经营管理等方面的缺点与偏差，进行了检查，从而初步弄清了商业工作的几个基本政策问题。又如东北总工会，召开了执委会，结合订下半年工作计划，检查出过去对团结全体工人阶级认识不足，对加强工人阶级责任感的教育与认识不足，对贯彻以生产为中心任务作得不足，并提出了改进办法，对改进今后工会工作将起积极作用。又如农林部负责人亲到现场，检查水利、新农具、林业、农场等工作，发现问题，可能时立即解决，并规定制度。
    还有一些单位存在两种偏向应当立即扭转
    第二种是以官僚主义、形式主义态度进行整风。不按本身具体情况，找出主要问题，以启发干部从政策上展开检讨，而是老一套的读文件，写反省笔记，开空泛的讨论会。因而批评与自我批评没有展开，当前主要问题未得具体解决，干部对整风情绪不高。这种偏向，东北局已指示各地纠正。
    第三种是领导上对整风方针与重点未认清，有的孤立整关系；有的泛泛整作风；有的一般地整贪污腐化；有的把批评与自我批评机械地割裂开，只号召干部批评领导，而不启发干部自我批评，以致脱离当前主要工作与基本政策，把原则问题与生活琐事纠缠一起，大家发顿牢骚，是非不分，责任不明，领导陷于被动，造成思想混乱。对于这种偏向，东北局指示：应立即扭转过来，首先要领导上对掌握整风方针的错误进行自我批评，把大家引导到整风的正确轨道上来，再提出当前主要问题，组织大家进行民主检查。
