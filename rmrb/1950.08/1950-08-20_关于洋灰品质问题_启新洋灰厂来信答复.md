　　Regarding Cement Quality Issues
    Reply from Qixin Cement Factory
　　To the Editor:
    We would like to express our gratitude for the article published in the People's Forum on the 7th of this month by Comrade Yan Lei criticizing our company for not paying attention to cement quality.
    In March and April of last year, our company sold 5,000 tons of cement to the Xiaofengman Engineering Bureau. When 1,000 tons were being used, it was discovered that a small portion of the cement had a slightly higher expansion rate (this batch of cement was made entirely from new cement clinker and needed to be stored for a certain period before leaving the factory; Xiaofengman was in urgent need of the cement, so new cement was sent). The bureau immediately raised the issue of cement quality with our company. During the negotiation, the engineering bureau continued to use the remaining 4,000 tons as normal. The so-called cement quality issue arose from making twelve cement cakes from a sample of thirty-two bags of cement. After the hot cake test, four were found to have non-compliant expansion, while the tensile and compressive strength were up to standard. To compensate for the loss of extra labor and materials, both parties agreed that Qixin would compensate the engineering bureau with 1,500 tons of cement; Fengman would be responsible for the dam's integrity. This is the truth about the compensation to Fengman for the cement.
    As for cement clinker, it is a semi-finished product. Some of the cement clinker stored in our factory was indeed manufactured during the enemy and puppet regime era, but when blended for use, it was only used after passing quality inspections. Therefore, the cement produced is guaranteed to meet standards, which can be proven by our factory's regular test reports. Now, after Comrade Yan Lei's reminder, our company will urge our technical personnel to pay special attention even more. Since the discovery of high expansion in the Fengman cement, no other cement from our company has had quality issues. However, our company is still not satisfied, and recently, in addition to overhauling all the machines to increase production, we are also striving to improve the quality of our cement.

### 关于洋灰品质问题  启新洋灰厂来信答复

　　关于洋灰品质问题
    启新洋灰厂来信答复
　　编辑同志：
    本月七日人民园地登载岩磊同志批评敝公司不注意洋灰品质一文。我们在此谨表谢忱。
    去年三四月间，本公司售给小丰满工程局洋灰五千吨。在提用千吨时，发现有一小部分洋灰涨力稍大（该批灰因全用新灰块造成，须存储一定时间再行出厂；小丰满因提用甚急，故发出新灰），该局即向本公司提出灰质问题。在交涉期间，该工程局仍照常提用其余四千吨。而所谓灰质问题，乃是由抽取三十二包洋灰中做成十二个灰饼。用热饼试验后，有四个涨力不合格，拉力、压力皆及格。为了补偿多用工料的损失，双方议定由启新赔偿该工程局洋灰一五○○吨；堤坝责任则由丰满自负。这是赔偿丰满洋灰的真相。
    至于灰块，系半成品。本厂所存的灰块中确有敌伪时代制造的，但掺合使用时，皆经过化验合格后方才使用。所以制出的洋灰保证合乎标准，这点可以用本厂经常之化验单证明。现在复经岩磊同志提示，本公司更当督促技术人员特别注意。自丰满灰发现涨力大以后，本公司其他洋灰尚未发生品质低劣问题。但是本公司仍未认为满意，近来除检修全部机器，增加产量外，对于洋灰品质正在力谋改进中。        启新洋灰股份有限公司
