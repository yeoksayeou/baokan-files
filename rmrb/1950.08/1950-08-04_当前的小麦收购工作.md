　　The Current Wheat Purchasing Work
　　Xu Dake
　　This year's wheat harvest is generally good across the country. The total wheat planting area nationwide reached 375 million mu, an increase of more than 30 million mu compared to last year. Preliminary estimates suggest a national wheat output of around 30 billion jin.

　　The increase in wheat production is partly due to timely rainfall and other natural causes, but more importantly, it is primarily due to the improved production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers after liberation. Especially in the old liberated areas after land reform, they enthusiastically responded to the People's Government's call for "Production First," and under the active leadership and assistance of labor heroes and production models, they implemented intensive cultivation and waged tenacious struggles against various disasters. At the same time, the wheat harvest is inseparable from the government's assistance. In the spring and winter seasons, the government supported the development of sideline production in rural areas with coarse grain for fine grain exchanges and various loans, and systematically supported farmers' spring plowing, sowing, and wheat harvesting. This year, in addition to general agricultural loans, the government allocated 14.5 million jin of coarse grain for fine grain exchange. In individual areas, such as Shandong Province, to help disaster victims overcome the severe difficulties of the "green-yellow" period before the wheat harvest, the Central Ministry of Trade allocated over 85 million jin of autumn grain to disaster victims to exchange for wheat and other sideline products. In Hebei Province, to effectively address the surplus wheat situation after the wheat harvest and adjust large quantities of coarse grain to prevent a disastrous drop in wheat prices and protect farmers from low prices, a special allocation of 130 million jin of coarse grain and 20.5 million jin of soybean cake was provided to exchange for farmers' wheat and other sideline products. Additionally, the Qingdao Municipal Grain Branch has allocated a total of 8 million jin of coarse grain and soybean cake, along with a large amount of cash, to grain branches in Jimo, Gaomi, and Shuitougou, which, through local cooperatives, purchase wheat from farmers. The China Grain Company has already transported the vast majority of the coarse grain used for wheat exchange to the purchasing areas. The corn, red sorghum, and soybean cake entering the pass from the Northeast alone amounts to 387 million jin. The North China Grain Company allocated a large amount of cash to its affiliated companies last month and transferred over 78.8 million jin of coarse grain and soybean cake from the companies in Pingyuan and Hebei provinces to exchange for wheat from farmers. Furthermore, the Tianjin People's Bank Cooperative Department issued autumn wheat loans equivalent to 210,000 jin of wheat last year, and spring wheat loans of over 500,000 jin this spring. This fully demonstrates the government's concrete assistance to the people.

　　Due to the bumper wheat harvest, we can estimate that farmers will have a large surplus of wheat to sell. Currently, as commodity prices are beginning to stabilize, the government, in order to address the price disadvantages farmers face when selling wheat and other difficulties, and to make grain merchants' transportation profitable, the Central Ministry of Trade issued the "Instructions on Commercial Administrative Work During Wheat Purchasing" in early June. The instructions emphasized that state-owned trading organizations should primarily control wheat price policies and maintain reasonable price differences between producing and selling areas during the wheat purchasing process. At the same time, to adjust the relationship between public and private sectors in purchasing, major and medium-sized cities can organize wheat joint purchasing committees. This allows for understanding the use of purchasing funds, facilitating the formulation of purchasing plans, and rationally allocating purchasing areas. On the other hand, it can establish close coordination with the industrial and commercial departments of local people's governments in purchasing areas to prevent competitive purchasing or fluctuations in wheat prices. Whether in the market or in wheat-producing areas, wheat can be freely purchased and transported, and unnecessary restrictions such as purchasing permits and limitations on purchasing quantities are not allowed. Private merchants are allowed to conduct purchasing freely, provided they do not violate the government's price policies. State-owned and private enterprises involved in large-scale purchasing are also provided with appropriate assistance. At the same time, to prevent excessively low wheat prices, enable farmers to reasonably exchange wheat for necessities, solve farmers' livelihood problems, promote the smooth flow of materials between urban and rural areas, and stabilize commodity prices, the Ministry of Trade issued the "Instructions on Wheat Purchasing by the China Grain Company in 1950" to the China Grain Company in mid-June. This clarified that the standard for wheat purchasing work is to maintain a reasonable exchange ratio between wheat and rice prices, not to meet numerical targets. Purchasing figures must be adjusted based on the prescribed national wheat price increase and decrease ranges. On the other hand, other specialized companies are also instructed to closely integrate with this work. In addition to the widespread support of coarse grain by the Grain Company, specialized companies dealing in general merchandise, cotton yarn, coal, salt, and other commodities must also concentrate on purchasing areas, widely cooperate with rural cooperatives, and sell goods in large quantities. This not only takes into account the interests of farmers but also plays a significant role in adjusting the relationship with private merchants.

　　New wheat from various regions is continuously entering the market. To complete this purchasing task, state-owned trading departments, primarily the China Grain Company, coordinated with various state-owned specialized brother companies and supply and marketing cooperatives to promote the establishment of wheat joint purchasing committees in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, Jinan, Henan, and other places. Tianjin established a wheat joint purchasing committee on July 1, initially deciding to purchase 30,000 packages of wheat (approximately 6 million jin), requiring approximately 5 billion yuan in funds, divided into five groups according to industry and region. Among them, 19 flour mills were divided into three groups, going to Xuzhou, Cangxian, Bengbu, and other places. The grain industry formed two groups, with the Pingyuan area as the central purchasing area. The industrial and commercial bureaus of the Shanghai and Southern Jiangsu municipal people's governments are actively preparing to establish joint purchasing committees. The North China Grain Company has been conducting purchasing in the wheat-producing areas of Pingyuan and Hebei provinces since mid-June. The Shandong Grain Branch has signed a contract with the local supply and marketing cooperative to act as an agent for wheat purchasing. State-owned grain companies in Qingdao, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi and other places have been organizing and uniting with private merchants in a planned manner to carry out purchasing work in wheat-producing areas since late June.

　　In terms of purchasing methods, half of the total will be exchanged for coarse grain, and the remainder will be purchased with currency to promote the use of RMB in rural areas. Currently, purchasing work is ongoing. For example, the Henan Provincial Grain Company purchased more than 3.88 million jin of wheat from mid-June to the end of June. The Hubei Provincial Grain Company also purchased more than 1.2 million jin in the Daye and other special districts. The Jiangxi Provincial Grain Company is vigorously purchasing in Jiujiang and other places. The Beijing Grain Branch began purchasing wheat and exchanging coarse grain for fine grain on July 4. On the first day, it received more than 20,000 jin of wheat. The General Supply and Marketing Cooperative also began to pre-order the widespread purchase of wheat in the suburbs of Beijing on July 3, with a quantity of 2 million jin. In addition, to meet the needs of cooperative members in Tianjin and Hebei provinces, the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative agreed to jointly purchase 40 million jin of wheat between July and October. Purchasing work requires striving for early completion—75% of the entire plan will be completed this year, and 45% of the total annual purchasing task will be completed in July, August, and September this year. The first quarter of next year requires basic completion, and all must be completed by the end of May.

　　In terms of purchasing prices, the basic principle is to ensure the maintenance of reasonable wheat prices and prevent "low grain prices harming farmers." The principle of considering both public and private interests also takes into account the reasonable transportation and sales profits of private merchants, maintains an appropriate exchange ratio between wheat and rice, and determines prices based on the natural circulation patterns and price differences between different regions. More careful regulations have been established for appropriate price differences at the junction of different regions.

　　What is the current dynamic of major wheat markets across the country? After the new wheat came on the market, wheat prices in various places once fell. State-owned trading companies adjusted purchasing figures with appropriate increase and decrease ranges. That is, when wheat prices fell excessively, purchasing figures were appropriately increased, and when wheat prices exceeded the prescribed standards, purchasing was appropriately reduced or suspended. Prices were adjusted in a timely manner, and wheat prices quickly stabilized. Therefore, the performance of major markets is roughly as follows: At the Tianjin Qitai Market, the first batch of 25 packages of new Shandong Dawenkou wheat were sold on June 7 at a price of 920 yuan per jin. At the end of June, the quantity of new wheat on the market was abundant, and as flour prices declined, manufacturers tended to wait and see. The prices of both new and old wheat fell by 80 to 60 yuan. At the beginning of July, wheat prices rose due to increased consumption in the production areas and limited supply. Manufacturers continued to purchase, and opening prices rose by another 20 yuan. At this time, due to the active purchasing or reduced/suspended purchasing by the North China Grain Company, prices were basically maintained at a stable level. After the new wheat came onto the market in Qingdao and surrounding areas of Shandong Province, new wheat in Gaomi and other areas once fell to 650 yuan per jin at the end of June due to farmers' eagerness to sell. After appropriate adjustments and purchasing by the grain company, it has been raised to 750 yuan per jin. Huaiyin in northern Jiangsu also once fell due to farmers' eagerness to sell, but after the grain company's purchasing work began, it rose from 500 yuan to 600 yuan per jin in late June. When new wheat first came onto the market in Hankou, it was subjected to speculative merchants suppressing prices for purchasing, and wheat prices fell to 510 yuan per jin on June 1. After adjustments, it had risen back to 612 yuan per jin by June 15. In Kaifeng, Henan, in mid-June, wheat prices rose from more than 600 yuan per jin at the beginning of the month to 740 yuan due to the large number of merchants from other areas purchasing in the market, exceeding the reasonable price ratio. The grain company immediately stopped purchasing and appropriately sold a portion, causing wheat prices to fall back to 664 yuan per jin. During the same period, wheat prices in Zhumadian and other areas of the province were too low, and the grain company immediately carried out large-scale purchasing. In late June, wheat prices rose from 455 yuan per jin in mid-June to more than 500 yuan. The wheat price in Xinxiang, the main wheat market in Pingyuan Province, also fell to 655 yuan per jin on June 11. After the Xinxiang Grain Branch took appropriate price control measures for purchasing, it had been adjusted to a steady increase of 720 yuan per jin by June 17. After the new wheat came onto the market in the Handan area of southern Hebei Province, prices were as low as 700 yuan per jin. Since the grain company's purchasing, prices have also risen back to around 800 yuan. Wheat prices in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, have also become increasingly normal. In addition, Wuxi and Bengbu once experienced a 13% increase in wheat prices in the ten days of mid-June due to blind competitive purchasing by private merchants. After the grain company posted adjustments, wheat prices in Wuxi had gradually decreased from 810 yuan per jin to 710 yuan in early July, and wheat prices in Bengbu had also slightly decreased.

　　Looking at the above wheat prices in the market, because of the stabilization of commodity prices and the reasonable adjustments of state-owned trading organizations, the reasonable difference between retail and wholesale prices has generally been maintained at 5% to 10%. In terms of the difference between producing and selling areas, the phenomenon of inverted prices has basically been reversed. At the same time, state-owned grain companies in various wheat-producing areas or markets have always implemented reasonable price policies, maintained an appropriate ratio between wheat and coarse grains, and played a considerable role in stabilizing market prices and protecting farmers' interests.

　　In terms of supplying the needs of rural areas after the wheat harvest and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, according to the market practice of previous years, new grain comes onto the market, grain prices plummet, and the prices of industrial products needed by rural areas rise instead, causing farmers to suffer a double loss. To ensure that farmers can buy back industrial products at a reasonable price after selling wheat, a large number of goods and a huge amount of currency must be sent to the countryside at the same time. And to avoid the flooding of currency into rural areas, suddenly rushing into the city, causing price fluctuations, the China Grain Company, in coordination with other brother specialized companies, carries urban industrial products equivalent to 45% of the purchasing volume, and private merchants transport the remaining 55% of industrial and handicraft products, continuously transported into rural areas, in time to recover currency, and keep prices normal.

　　For example, the North China Branch of the China General Merchandise Company vigorously transferred general merchandise and daily necessities to general merchandise companies in various major administrative regions and across North China in May to supply the needs of farmers after the wheat harvest, with a total value of over 80 billion yuan, and transferred goods such as sugar, alkali, various colored fabrics, soap, towels, matches, fertilizer powder, and red alum, with a total value of over 200 billion yuan. The total amount currently transferred is more than 50.7 billion yuan. The China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has prepared various fabrics and cotton yarn worth approximately 100 billion yuan. For example, the North China Branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has transferred more than 110,000 pieces of various colored fabrics and more than 800 pieces of coarse and fine yarn since June. The Beijing Branch of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has been continuously transporting a large number of yarn and cloth to suburban areas and branch companies or flower collection stations in Tongxian, Dingxian, and Zhuoxian since late June, vigorously promoting sales to rural areas, and combining with local grain companies and cooperatives to sign contracts for the sale of yarn and cloth. The China Salt Industry Company has prepared 480,000 dan of edible salt, and the Tianjin Direct Branch Company has transported a total of 216,000 dan of edible salt to Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, and other areas. The North China Branch of the China Petroleum Trading Company allocated a total of 602,000 gallons of kerosene. The Beijing Branch organized cadres to go to the countryside and promote sales with cooperatives in early June, so that a large amount of kerosene was supplied to rural areas. Therefore, although June is a slow month for oil sales, the total sales of kerosene for the month still reached 161.79% of the original plan. The China Coal Industry Building Materials Company is also allocating a large amount of coal for sales to rural areas. In addition, to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the Ministry of Railways reduced the freight rates for wheat and other three kinds of food grains on northern and southern railways from July 13, with wheat charged at 75% of the current freight rate. To meet the needs of wheat purchasing and the resulting exchange of materials, the Tianjin People's Bank partially organized inter-port remittance business in July, providing key support for urban-rural exchange work. In this way, to avoid the double loss suffered by farmers in previous years, the needed industrial products are effectively delivered to the countryside in a timely manner, so that farmers can reasonably exchange necessary daily necessities after selling wheat, and also complete the task of recovering currency. And 55% of the large number of industrial and handicraft products are promoted by private merchants, which is a strong proof that the government encourages private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood to develop production.

　　In summary, the government made full preparations and took care of all aspects in this year's wheat harvest work. Therefore, this work is progressing smoothly in all aspects. The experience gained so far is as follows: First - the measures taken to support production in various ways for farmers in the autumn of last year and the spring of this year, laying a good foundation for the wheat harvest, achieving the goal of increased production, are necessary and successful. Second - state-owned trading companies specifically arranged purchasing, exchange, transportation, and correct control of reasonable price policies at the time of the wheat harvest, which played a significant role in completing the purchasing work. Third - state-owned trading companies automatically sent a large number of industrial products and daily necessities needed by farmers to the countryside to meet the production and living needs of farmers, reducing the burden on farmers, and making considerable achievements in preventing "low grain prices harming farmers" and protecting farmers' interests. Fourth - in terms of private industrial and commercial enterprises, in adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors, methods such as joint purchasing or free purchasing are used to encourage private merchants to transport goods and take care of reasonable price differences between producing and selling areas. Fifth - private merchants promote sales in the countryside according to the assigned proportions and ensure that private merchants have reasonable profits. For example, the Jiangxi Grain Company stipulates that the company will pay a certain amount of handling fees to private merchants when they purchase wheat on behalf of the company, depending on the distance of the route and other conditions. This strengthens the relationship of unity with private merchants and also encourages the operating sentiment of grain merchants. Sixth - to prevent the phenomenon of unilaterally taking care of farmers in purchasing and disregarding the quality of grain prices, the Central South Grain Region Company has specifically stipulated the standards for the moisture and impurities content of wheat in various places. Those that do not meet the standards will not be accepted, will be accepted at a lower price, or will have their prices reduced, and those that have deteriorated will not be accepted.

　　From these experiences, we can see that in the new stage of the wheat harvest, state-owned trading companies can take the lead in making the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas tend to prosper. As a result, the general purchasing power of the market has increased, which is very beneficial to the improvement of the operating conditions of private industrial and commercial enterprises. However, there are still some industrialists and businessmen who have not changed their old ideas and styles, do not pay attention to self-reliance, lack the spirit of actively overcoming difficulties, and still have the idea of simply relying on the government. Some private merchants have put forward excessive or unreasonable demands: They hope that state-owned specialized companies, in the purchase and sale of industrial products, in addition to giving private merchants a preferential discount of 95%, the retail price should also be increased by another 5% according to the list price. Some do not actively raise funds themselves, but infinitely demand that the government can provide long-term loans. Obviously, these requirements are not entirely consistent with the policies of mutual benefit for both public and private sectors and overall planning. Secondly, there are still a few unscrupulous merchants who, in the process of purchasing, look for gaps in the market, attempt to speculate and seek excessive profits, which is undesirable and must be corrected. Otherwise, they will not only go down a dead end themselves, but will also hinder the recovery and development of the social economy.

　　There are also some shortcomings in state-owned trade that must be overcome. In the purchasing process, the sales agency and other contracts signed between state-owned trade and various specialized companies, cooperatives, and private industrial and commercial enterprises must be fully valued and implemented. In addition, for example, in late June, branches of the North China Grain Company in some areas experienced the phenomenon of purchasing at high prices, or the one-sided idea of simply completing tasks, which hindered the purchasing work. In the future, it should consolidate its accumulated experience on a better foundation, continuously improve, correctly grasp policies, complete tasks, and serve the people more effectively.

　　当前的小麦收购工作
    徐大可
    今年全国小麦，一般来说是丰收的，全国小麦种植面积共达三亿七千五百万亩，比去年增加三千多万亩，初步估计全国约产小麦三百亿斤上下。
    小麦的增产，一部分是由于雨量适时和其他自然原因，但更重要的首先是在解放后，广大农民的生产情绪提高，特别是土地改革后的老解放区，热烈响应了人民政府“生产第一”的号召，在劳动英雄和生产模范的积极带头与帮助下，实行了精耕细作和对各种灾害进行了顽强的斗争。同时小麦的丰收与政府的帮助是分不开的，政府在春冬两季，用以粗换细和各种贷款扶助农村开展副业生产，有计划地支持了农民的春耕播种和麦收。今年除一般的农贷外，政府拨出以粗换细粮达一四五○○万斤；又在个别地区，如山东省为扶持灾民度过麦收前青黄不接的严重困难，曾经由中央贸易部批拨秋粮八千五百万余斤，贷给灾民，交换小麦及其他副业产品；如河北省为了很好的解决群众麦收后小麦富裕，调剂大量粗粮，以防止麦收后麦价惨跌，麦贱伤农，曾特别拨给粗粮一亿三千万斤，豆饼二千零五十万斤，换取农民的小麦及其他副业产品；又如青岛市粮食分公司已拨出粗粮和豆饼共计八百万斤和大批现款，发给即墨、高密、水头沟等地的粮食支公司；通过各该地合作社向农民换购小麦；中国粮食公司目前已将极大部分用以交换小麦的粗粮，运达收购地区。其中仅由东北入关的玉米、红粮、豆饼等即达三亿八千七百万斤。华北区粮食公司曾于上月拨给所属各级公司大批现金，并向平原、河北两省公司调出粗粮及豆饼七千八百余万斤，向农民换购小麦。此外，如天津人民银行合作部，在去年贷出秋麦贷款折小麦二十一万斤，今春也贷出春麦贷款五十余万斤。这充分表现了政府对人民的具体帮助。
    由于小麦的丰收，我们就可以估计到农民将有大量剩余小麦拿来出售的，目前因为正当物价开始稳定时期，政府为了解决农民出售小麦时价格上的吃亏和其他的困难，又使粮商贩运有利可图起见，中央贸易部于六月初旬，发布了“关于收购小麦时商业行政工作的指示”，重点的指示了国营贸易机构在小麦的收购过程中，主要是要掌握麦价政策，保持产销地区的合理差价。同时为了调整采购中的公私关系，各大中城市可组织小麦联购委员会，这样一方面可以了解采购资金的运用情况，便于订立采购计划，合理分配采购地区，另一方面又可与采购地方的各级人民政府的工商部门取得密切的配合，防止发生争购或造成麦价波动的现象。不论在市场上或产麦地区，小麦是可以自由采购贩运的，不许再有采购证及限制收购数量等不必要的限制，让私商在不违背政府的价格政策的条件下，自由进行采购，对大宗收购的公私厂商，还予以适当的协助。同时为了防止小麦价格过低，使农民能以小麦，合理交换到生活必需品，解决农民生活，促使城乡物资畅流，并稳定物价起见，在六月中旬，贸易部又对中国粮食公司发出“关于一九五○年粮食公司收购小麦的指示”，在收购小麦工作上，明确了以保持麦米适当交换比例的麦价政策为标准，不以完成数字为标准，必须根据规定的全国麦价，升降幅度，调整收购数字。另一方面对其他各专业公司，也指出必须与这个工作密切的结合起来，除由粮食公司普遍的以粗粮支持外，百货、纱布、煤、盐等专业公司也必须集中在购麦地区广泛的结合农村合作社配合收购，大量出售货物。这不但照顾到了农民的利益，在对私商的调整上，也起了很大的作用。
    各地新麦源源不绝的上市了。国营贸易部门为了完成这个收购任务，首先是中国粮食公司配合着各国营专业兄弟公司、供销合作社等，先后在天津、上海、青岛、济南、河南等地推动组织小麦联购委员会。天津在七月一日成立了小麦联购委员会，初步决定购买小麦三万包（约六百万斤），所需资金约五十亿元，按行业和地区分五个小组进行。其中面粉业十九个厂分成三个小组，分往徐州、沧县、蚌埠等地，粮食业组成两个小组，以平原一带为采购中心地区；上海及苏南各大城市人民政府工商局正积极筹组联购委员会；华北区粮食公司从六月中旬起在平原、河北两省产麦地区进行收购；山东粮食分公司已与当地供销合作总社订立了代收小麦的合同；青岛、湖南、湖北和江西等地的国营粮食公司于六月下旬起即在产麦地区有组织、有计划的推动与联合着私商展开了收购工作。
    在收购方法上，总数的一半，将以粗粮换取，其余则以货币购买，以便推行人民币下乡。目前收购工作在不断进行。如河南省粮食公司，由六月中旬到六月底，即已收购小麦三百八十八万多斤。湖北省粮食公司，也在大冶等专区收购了一百二十多万斤。江西省粮食公司正在九江等地，大力收购中。北京粮食分公司于七月四日开始收购小麦和办理以粗换细的交换工作，第一天共收进了小麦二万余斤；供销合作总社亦于七月三日，在京郊区开始预定普遍收购小麦，数量为二百万斤。此外，为解决天津市及河北省两地合作社社员群众的需要，河北省供销社与天津市供销社协议，由七——十月间联营购进小麦四千万斤。收购工作要求是要尽量提前——今年完成全部计划的百分之七十五，而在今年七、八、九三个月将完成全年收购任务的百分之四十五，明年第一季要求基本上完成，五月底则必须全部完成。
    在收购价格上，是以保证维持合理麦价，防止“谷贱伤农”为基本原则的。在公私兼顾的原则下也照顾到私商合理的运销利润，保持麦米适当的交换比例，并根据各个地区间小麦的自然流转规律和差价，来确定价格。对地区间接界处，更加慎重的规定了适当的差价。
    目前全国小麦主要市场的动态是怎样呢？从新麦上市后，各地麦价曾一度下跌，国营贸易公司以适当的升降幅度，调整收购数字，即麦价下跌过大时，适当增加收购数字，麦价超过规定标准时，适当少购或停购的方针，及时调整价格，麦价便迅速转稳。因此，主要市场上的表现大致是这样的：天津启泰市场六月七日新麦山东大汶口货，首次上市二十五包，以每斤九百二十元的价格全部销出。六月末旬新麦上市数量充裕，并以粉价下降，厂商倾向观望，新陈小麦先后下落八十元至六十元，七月初旬小麦因产区吃的增重，来源不多，价格上升，厂商续有购进，开价再升二十元，此时由于华北粮食公司的积极收购或少购停购，基本上保持了平稳。山东省青岛周围各地新麦登场后，由于农民急于出售，高密一带新麦在六月末旬曾一度跌到每斤六百五十元，经粮食公司适当调剂和收购以后，已提升到每斤七百五十元。苏北的淮阴，也是因为农民急欲出售，一度下跌，但在粮食公司收购工作展开后，六月下旬每斤即由五百元回升到六百元。汉口市新麦初上市时，曾遭受投机商人抑价收购，麦价于六月一日下降到每斤五百一十元，经调整后六月十五日每斤已回升到六百一十二元；河南开封在六月中旬，因外埠粮商多至市场收购，麦价由初旬的每斤六百多元升到七百四十元，超过合理比价，粮食公司当即停止收购，并适当抛售一部，使麦价回跌至每斤六百六十四元；同一时期，该省驻马店一带麦价过低，粮食公司即行大量收购，下旬麦价即由中旬的每斤四百五十五元升至五百多元。平原省主要小麦市场新乡的麦价，六月十一日也曾下跌到每斤六百五十五元，新乡粮食分公司掌握适当的价格收购后，至十七日已调整稳步回升到每斤七百二十元。河北省南部邯郸地区新麦上市后，价格曾低到每斤七百元，自粮食公司收购后，价格亦回升到八百元左右。山西省太原小麦价格也已日趋正常。另外，无锡、蚌埠两地曾因私商盲目竞购，麦价在六月中旬的十天内上涨了百分之十三，经粮食公司挂牌调整后，七月上旬无锡麦价已由每斤八百一十元缓降为七百一十元，蚌埠麦价也已稍有回落。
    综观以上小麦在市场上的价格，因为物价的稳定与国营贸易机关的合理调整，以零售价和批发价差额说，一般已保持了百分之五—百分之十的合理差额；以产销地区差额来说，倒挂的现象，基本上已扭转过来了。同时国营粮食公司在各产麦地区或市场上，始终是贯彻了合理的价格政策，维持小麦与杂粮的适当比例，对稳定市场价格与保障农民利益上，都起了相当的作用。
    在供应麦收后农村的需要与城乡物资交流上，依据历年市场惯例，新粮上市，粮价暴跌，而农村所需工业品的价格反而高涨，农民因此遭受双重损失。为了保证农民在出卖小麦后能以合理的代价购回工业品，必须使大批货物与巨量货币同时下乡，并且为了避免货币充斥农村，突然冲进城市，引起物价的波动，首由中国粮食公司配合其他兄弟专业公司，携带价值相当于百分之四十五收购量的城市工业品，另由私商贩运其余百分之五十五的工业及手工业品，源源运进农村，及时回笼货币，使物价保持正常。
    举例来说，中国百货公司华北区公司，为供应麦收后农民的需要，五月份向全国各大行政区及华北区各地百货公司，大力调拨百货及日用品，总值达八百余亿元，并调拨总值二千余亿元的糖、碱、各色布匹、肥皂、毛巾、火柴、肥田粉、红矾等货物，目前已调出的总金额为五百零七亿多元；中国花纱布公司已准备了各种布匹与棉纱约值一千亿元，如华北区花纱布公司六月份以来调出各种色布十一万多匹，粗细纱八百多件；花纱布北京分公司在六月下旬起，陆续运送大批纱布至郊区及通县、定县、涿县等支公司或收花站，大力向农村推销，并与各地粮食公司、合作社结合，订立代销纱布合同。中国盐业公司准备食盐四十八万担，天津直属公司已向北京、天津、石家庄等地区共输送食盐二十一万六千多担；中国石油贸易公司华北区公司调拨煤油共六十万二千多加仑，北京分公司于六月初即行组织干部下乡与合作社进行推销工作，使大量煤油供应农村，因而六月份虽系销油淡月，但全月销出煤油仍达原计划的百分之一六一·七九；中国煤业建筑器材公司，也正拨出大量煤炭向农村推销。此外，铁道部为促进城乡物资交流，从七月十三日起，减低了北方和南方铁路的小麦等三种食粮的运价，小麦按现行运价七五折计费；天津人民银行为适应小麦采购及由此而生的物资交流的需要，七月份部分的举办了埠际押汇业务，对城乡交流工作，予以重点的扶植。这样，为了避免农民遭受与往年相同的双重损失，及时的将需要的工业品，有效的送到农村，使农民出售小麦，合理换回必要的日用品，同时也完成了回笼货币的任务，而将百分之五十五的大批工业及手工业品，由私商来推销，这正是政府鼓励有利于国计民生的私营工商业，发展生产的有力证明。
    综合说来，在今年的麦收工作中，政府是作到了充分的准备，也照顾了全面。因此，这个工作是全面的在顺利进行着，到目前为止，所获得的经验是这样的：第一——对农民在去年的秋后和今年的春季，即用各种方式，扶持生产，为麦收打下好的基础，达到了增产目的，这种措施是必要的和成功的。第二——在麦收时国营贸易公司，具体布置了收购、交换、输送及正确的掌握了合理价格政策，对收购工作的完成有重大的作用。第三——国营贸易公司自动的将农民所需要的工业品、生活必需品，大批的送到农村去，满足农民的生产与生活需要，减轻了农民负担，在防止“谷贱伤农”与保障农民利益上，是有相当成绩的。第四——对私营工商业方面，在调整公私关系上，用联购或自由收购等的方式，鼓励私商贩运，并照顾了产销地区的合理差价。第五——私商按照分配比例，下乡推销，并保证私商有合理的利润可图，例如江西粮食公司根据路程的远近及其他各种条件，规定私商代购小麦时，由公司付给一定数目的手续费。加强了与私商间的团结关系，也鼓舞了粮商的经营情绪。第六——为防止在收购中发生片面照顾农民而不顾粮价质量好坏的现象，如中南粮食区公司，曾具体规定各地小麦所含水分和杂质的标准，不合标准的不收、少收或降低价格，变质者不收。
    从以上这些经验中可以看到，在麦收的新阶段下，国营贸易公司能够带头的使城乡物资交流，趋向繁荣，由此市场一般购买力呈现了增涨，这对于私营工商业经营状况的好转是非常有利的。但是目前尚有某些工商业者，还没有转变旧的思想和作风，还不注意自力更生，还缺乏主动克服困难的精神，还存在着单纯依赖政府的思想，有的私商提出过高或不合理的要求：希望各国营专业公司，在工业品的收购和推销上，除了给私商批发九五扣的优待外，零售价还应该按牌价再提高百分之五，也有的自己不主动筹集资金，而是无限地要求政府能长期贷款，显然，这些要求都是与公私两利、统筹兼顾的政策不尽相合的。其次是仍有少数不正当商人在收购过程中，瞅着市场的空隙，企图投机取巧，谋取暴利，这些都是不应该的，必须努力改正。否则不仅自己将走入绝路，且将妨碍社会经济的恢复和发展。
    在国营贸易方面，也还存在着一些缺点，必须努力克服。在收购过程中，国营贸易与各专业公司合作社、私营工商业相互间所签订的代销等合同，必须充分重视和实行。另外，例如华北区粮食公司在六月下旬，部分地区的分支公司，发生高价收购的现象，或单纯为达成任务的片面思想，这都是妨碍收购工作的。今后应该在更好的基础上，巩固其积累的经验，不断的改进，正确的掌握政策，完成任务，更有效的为人民服务。
