Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 5th: According to TASS, Pravda published an editorial on the 4th entitled "A Great Contribution to the Cause of Peace," commenting on the victory of the Soviet peace signature campaign, stating: The Soviet peace signature campaign has a truly national character. It powerfully demonstrates the spiritual and political unity of all nationalities of the Soviet Union, and strong Soviet patriotism. The Soviet people are building their motherland, and they need a consolidated and lasting peace. The peace signature campaign has aroused a new surge of labor enthusiasm among the Soviet working people, who are organizing peace work teams and using new labor achievements to strengthen the country's power. Because they know that the stronger the Soviet Union, the more guaranteed the cause of world peace.

The editorial concluded: The working people of the world are looking to the Soviet Union. The great example of the Soviet people inspires peace advocates around the world. The peace movement is unfolding day by day and is gradually becoming a great force sufficient to save the cause of peace.

Izvestia published an article on the 4th written by Kotov, Executive Secretary of the Soviet Peace Committee, stating: The Soviet signature campaign has great international significance. It has further enhanced the Soviet Union's international reputation among peace advocates around the world; it also makes a positive contribution to more broadly exposing the aggressors' plans. The signatures of more than 115 million Soviet people, combined with the signatures of peace advocates around the world, have constituted a force that is enough to frighten the warmongers.
