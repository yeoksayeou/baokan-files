Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th (TASS dispatch): Residents in the liberated areas of South Korea continue to write letters to Kim Il-sung, thanking the People's Army, the government of the Republic, and the leader of the Korean people, Kim Il-sung, for saving the South Korean people from the police-fascist rule of the traitor Syngman Rhee.

　　The letter passed at the Incheon city-wide meeting stated: Thanks to the heroic People's Army led by you, Incheon was completely liberated from the hands of the American imperialists and the traitor Syngman Rhee on July 4th. We will never forget our joy. We are firmly determined to spare no effort to completely annihilate the enemy and give all support to you and the People's Army led by you, who have brought us happiness and a new life, as well as to the government of the Republic. We resolutely guarantee to support your call: Rise up and drive out the armed aggressors—the American imperialists and their servant traitor Syngman Rhee—from our country, and do our best to fight for the freedom, unification, and independence of the fatherland.

　　Farmers in Beopseong District (transliteration) of Gyeonggi Province wrote in a letter to Kim Il-sung: Our dream of many years has been realized—we have obtained land thanks to the heroic People's Army. Now we will forever be the masters of the land. Our words cannot express our joyful feelings. The American imperialists are pursuing a shameless policy of aggression, provoking the Korean civil war, and treating the Korean people with unprecedented brutality. We, the farmers of Beopseong District, declare: We are determined to hold high the flag of the Republic and fight to the end with the people of the whole country. We will never give up until we have completely annihilated the enemy. We will work more enthusiastically to help the People's Army grow stronger. We will restore agriculture destroyed by the enemy as quickly as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 7th (TASS dispatch): The newly liberated counties of South Korea have launched a high tide of elections for representatives to village and district People's Committees. The elections in Gyeonggi Province have been completed. Representatives to the People's Committees have been elected in one thousand two hundred and one villages and one hundred and thirty-three districts.

　　People from all walks of life democratically elected representatives to attend the People's Committees.

　　For example, the representatives of the People's Committees in ninety-five villages and nine districts of Goyang County are composed of ninety-two workers, four hundred and twenty-three farmers, seventeen staff members, two merchants, one factory owner, and twenty-four representatives from other social strata.

　　The newly elected village People's Committees have begun their practical activities. First of all, they are preparing to implement land reform.
