Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 2nd. Due to the hot weather in summer, which easily causes accidents, state-owned coal mines in Yiluo, Henan, and other areas are now conducting a major emergency safety inspection. As a result of the active improvement of safety work in state-owned coal mines in Henan during the second quarter of this year, accidents have significantly decreased. Statistics show that a total of 34 accidents occurred in the entire quarter, a decrease of 226 compared to the first quarter. The average worker casualty rate per 10,000 tons of coal was 0.28 deaths and 12 injuries, also a decrease of 79% compared to the first quarter's 21 deaths and 37 injuries. This is because, in the second quarter, safety organizations were generally established in various mines, with full-time safety personnel assigned; and systems such as wellhead inspections, shift handover, and engineer duty were implemented. At the same time, the thinking of some coal mine cadres who emphasized that safety equipment was rudimentary and accidents were unavoidable was overcome; existing equipment was utilized as much as possible, and substitutes for safety machinery were created. For example, the Yiluo Coal Mine had seven safety lamps that had been abandoned for a long time due to the lack of horseshoe magnets, but now the lamps have been lit using electromagnets. To further strengthen safety work, the entire province will uniformly train coal mine safety personnel in batches in mid-August. Currently, due to the hot weather, poor ventilation in the mines, and high gas levels, which can easily cause accidents, the mines have begun to conduct major emergency safety inspections.

Xinhua News Agency, Hankou. The Central South Region Coal Mine Safety Work Conference pointed out that the main key to in-depth development of coal mine safety work at present is to thoroughly correct the erroneous understanding of safety issues by some coal mine enterprise cadres, and at the same time establish an effective safety responsibility system and reward and punishment system. The Central South Region Coal Mine Safety Conference was held in late June, with representatives from the Central South Military and Political Committee and the industrial departments of the people's governments of various subordinate provinces, coal mine enterprises, and trade union systems participating. The meeting examined the erroneous ideas of some cadres about safety work, such as paralysis and carelessness, irresponsibility, or the belief that accidents are unavoidable; however, when the higher authorities strictly inspect and investigate accident responsibilities, they are afraid of taking responsibility and are unwilling to undertake safety work. Therefore, based on the coal mine safety work situation in the Central South Region in the past six months and the conditions of coal mine equipment and geology in the Central South Region, the meeting adopted four measures for coal mine safety responsibility division, safety work rewards and punishments, safety inspections, and safety education to improve future coal mine safety work. Regarding the division of safety responsibilities, the meeting made the following clear provisions: administrative and engineering leaders at all levels, heads of military control in various mines, directors and deputy directors, managers, and even relevant section chiefs, section heads, and engineering leaders at all levels are naturally responsible for all liability accidents; safety work leaders and engineering leaders at all levels are responsible for daily work such as safety planning, safety equipment, and engineering inspection. The reward and punishment measures stipulate that those who have made creations and improvements in safety work or have made achievements in preventing accidents; those who have made meritorious contributions to rescue after an accident occurs; and those who have gradually reduced the number of major and minor accidents month by month within three months will be given various rewards according to the size of their achievements. Those who cause liability accidents, the mine and factory directors and relevant personnel shall be subject to certain penalties according to the severity of the liability accidents that occur. Since March of this year, many coal mines in the Central South Region have made some improvements to safety work based on the Central South Military and Political Committee's decision on strengthening industrial and mining safety work. For example, after the Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan modified the mechanical ventilation equipment, methane is no longer easy to accumulate in the main roadways, and a system of wellhead inspection and underground patrol has been implemented; the Xiangjiang Coal Mine in Hunan has avoided the danger of flooding four times by using water exploration drills when mining coal; and the Pingxiang Coal Mine has also improved ventilation routes and increased underground air volume. However, accidents and violations of underground safety rules still occur quite frequently in various mines. According to statistics for the most recent two months, 35 workers have been injured or killed in state-owned and provincial-owned coal mines in the Central South Region due to accidents, with an average of one worker dying per 10,000 tons of coal produced.

　　由于积极改进工作
    河南宜洛等矿事故显然减少
    中南煤矿保安会议通过负责奖惩等办法
    【新华社开封二日电】因夏季天热，易生事故，河南宜洛等公营煤矿现正进行保安紧急大检查。今年第二季中河南各公营煤矿积极改进保安工作的结果，事故已显著减少。统计全季共发生事故三十四次，较第一季减少二百二十六次，平均每万吨煤的工人伤亡率为死亡零点二八人，受伤十二人；也较第一季的死亡二十一人，受伤三十七人减少了百分之七十九。这是因为在第二季中，各矿普遍建立了保安机构，设置专职保安人员；实行井口检查，交接班和工程师值班等制度。同时，克服了若干煤矿干部强调保安设备简陋，事故不可避免的思想；尽量利用原有设备，设法创制保安机械的代用品。如宜洛煤矿原有七盏安全灯，因无蹄形磁铁，长久弃置不用，现在利用电磁铁开了灯。为进一步加强保安工作，八月中全省将统一分期训练煤矿保安人员。目前因气候炎热，矿内通风困难，瓦斯较大，容易发生事故，各矿已开始进行安全紧急大检查。
    【本报讯】新华社汉口电：中南区煤矿保安工作会议指出：目前使煤矿保安工作深入展开的主要关键，是彻底纠正部分煤矿企业干部对保安问题的错误认识，同时建立有效的保安责任制和奖惩制。中南区煤矿安全会议系于六月下旬召开，有中南区军政委员会和所属各省人民政府工业部门、煤矿企业及工会系统代表参加。会议检查出部分干部对保安工作有麻痹大意、不负责任、或认为事故不可避免等项错误思想；但当上级严格检查并追究事故责任时，便又怕负责任而不愿担任保安工作。因此，会议根据中南区半年来煤矿保安工作情况和中南区煤矿设备和地质特点等条件，通过了煤矿保安责任划分、保安工作奖惩、保安检查和保安教育等四项办法，以改进今后煤矿安全工作。关于保安责任划分，会议作了如下明确规定：各级行政及工程领导人员、各矿军管负责人、正副局长、经理以至有关课长、股长和各级工程负责人，均为一切责任事故的当然责任者；保安工作负责人、各级工程负责人为保安计划、安全设备、工程检查等日常工作的负责者。奖惩办法中规定凡对保安工作有创造、改进或对防止事故有成绩者；事故发生后抢救有功者，大小事故在三个月内逐月渐少者，均按其成绩大小，予以各种奖励。凡发生责任事故者，矿、厂长和有关人员应按发生的责任事故的情节轻重，分别受到一定处分。按自今年三月以来，中南区不少煤矿根据中南军政委员会关于加强工矿保安工作的决定，已对保安工作作了若干改进。如河南宜洛煤矿改装了机器通风设备后，主要巷道中沼气已不易聚积，并实行了井口检查和井下巡查的制度；湖南湘江煤矿采煤时使用探水钻以后，已四次避免了水淹危险；萍乡煤矿亦改善了通风路线，增加了井下风量。但是各矿发生事故和违犯井下安全规则的现象仍相当严重。据最近两个月的统计，中南区国营和省营煤矿中即因事故而伤亡工人三十五人，平均产煤万吨即死亡工人一名。
