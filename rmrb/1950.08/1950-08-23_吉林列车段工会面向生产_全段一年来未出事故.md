　　Jilin Train Section Union Faces Production
    No Accidents in the Entire Section for a Year

    [Our Jilin Dispatch] The Jilin Train Section Union Committee of the Jilin Railway Administration, due to mastering the principle of "the union facing production," has had no accidents for a year, from June 24th of last year to June 24th of this year. The union in this section has adopted these effective methods in leading production: First, after the work tasks of the section are determined, the union immediately convenes a worker representative meeting, and absorbs technical workers, "Iron Ox" team leaders, and production team leaders to participate in discussing methods to complete tasks and overcome difficulties. Problems that cannot be solved are submitted to the administration for assistance. Second, following the representative meeting, each production team uses a discussion meeting format to specifically formulate its own production plan. Union leaders are also assigned to participate in each team to help formulate plans. Third, to prevent team competitions from becoming a mere formality, the union, in coordination with the administration, established an inspection system. The Party, government, and union are assigned to conduct regular inspections, and timely praise or criticism is given. In addition, "introduction meetings" are organized to introduce good and bad examples discovered during inspections and spot checks, as well as outstanding deeds in ordinary times, to other chartered car groups and relevant departments for learning. For example, at the introduction meeting, the spirit of Li Jinghua and Mao Weixun's chartered car group in serving passengers was introduced, promoting other chartered car groups to learn from them. As a result, many chartered car groups have also received praise from passengers. From June 24th of last year to July 22nd of this year, the entire section received a total of 448 letters of commendation from passengers. Fourth, in order to better promote the spirit of democracy and strengthen the sense of responsibility of cadres, the union implemented a "production appraisal" method. Every time a relatively responsible cadre in the section goes on duty or completes a task, the union organizes workers to appraise whether the cadre did well or poorly (Editor's note: This method is very good and should be promoted. However, if the "responsible cadre" is not a member, the administrative department should organize the appraisal meeting. The union can mobilize members to offer criticisms and suggestions). Since the implementation of this method, the section has overcome phenomena such as cadres being careless and irresponsible in their work. The union's various committees have also played a significant role in promoting work: for example, the production committee organizes challenge competitions within the section to ensure the completion of production tasks. The culture and education committee uses forms such as plays, blackboards, and wall newspapers to introduce typical deeds and figures, making workers more excited to engage in production.

　　吉林列车段工会面向生产
    全段一年来未出事故
    【本报吉林讯】吉林铁路管理局吉林列车段工会委员会，由于掌握了“工会面向生产”的方针，自去年六月二十四日到今年六月二十四日，一年未发生事故。该段工会在领导生产上采取了这些有效办法：一、工会在该段工作任务确定后，即召开工人代表会议，并吸收技术工人、铁牛队长、生产小组长参加，讨论完成任务及克服困难的办法。不能解决的问题提交行政帮助解决。二、继代表会后，各生产小组用座谈会的方式，具体订出本小组的生产计划。工会领导干部也都分工参加各小组帮助订计划。三、为防止小组竞赛流于形式，工会配合行政建立了检查制度，党、政、工分工掌握定期检查，及时表扬或批评。此外并组织“介绍会”，把检查与抽查出来的好坏典型及平素的突出事迹，介绍给其他包车组及有关部门学习。如在介绍会上，介绍了李静华和毛维训包车组为旅客服务的精神，推动了其他包车组向他们学习，很多包车组也因而得到了旅客的称赞，全段自去年六月二十四日至今年七月二十二日共收到旅客表扬信四百四十八封。四、工会为更好地发扬民主精神和加强干部的责任心，实行了“生产鉴定”办法。全段比较负责的干部，每当出乘一次或做完一件事后，即由工会组织工人来鉴定干部做的好与坏（编者按：此办法甚好，应推广。但“负责干部”如非会员时，应由行政组织鉴定会。工会可发动会员提出批评与建议）。该段自实行此法后，克服了干部工作马虎和不负责任等现象。工会的各委员会对推动工作也起了很大作用：如生产委员会，在段内组织挑战竞赛，保证完成生产任务。文教委员会利用演剧、黑板报及墙报等形式，介绍典型事迹和人物，使得工人们更兴奋地进行生产。（李益、红文、联众）
