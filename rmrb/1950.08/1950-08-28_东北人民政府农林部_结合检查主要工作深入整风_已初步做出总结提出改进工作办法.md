　　Northeast People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry
    Deepening Rectification by Combining Inspection of Main Work
    Preliminary Summary Made and Improvement Measures Proposed
    [This newspaper report] According to news from the Northeast Daily: After a month and a half of inspection and summary work, the rectification movement of the Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry and its subordinate divisions and bureaus has become more in-depth. Currently, the department has made preliminary summaries of the main work of its subordinate divisions and bureaus, identified many problems, and found the crux of the problems. It is now continuing to deepen the inspection on one hand, and focusing on studying improvement measures for the future on the other.
    The rectification of the Northeast Department of Agriculture and Forestry correctly grasped the policy of focusing on inspecting and summarizing the current main work from the very beginning, and determined the focus of the inspection work. This has linked the rectification with the current main work. For example, the department's overall leadership work focuses on inspecting water conservancy and promoting new agricultural tools. The Water Conservancy Bureau under the department is currently in a tense flood season, and is using flood control inspection as the main way to inspect water conservancy work. Mechanical farms are busy with wheat harvesting, and the department instructed the Mechanical Farm Administration Bureau to focus on inspecting wheat harvesting, summarizing the experience and lessons learned from the loss of 30% of wheat in some farms during last year's harvest, in order to reduce losses this year.
    During the inspection, the department mainly used two methods, namely, inspection at professional meetings and in-depth on-site inspection by responsible cadres; and these two methods were combined with each other. After the rectification began, the department first convened a meeting of responsible cadres from various departments, where Minister Du Zaiheng made a mobilization report on rectification, pointing out the main problems in the work of various departments based on the information known by the leadership, as the focus of the inspection. The divisions and bureaus then convened a series of relevant professional meetings to inspect the work, make preliminary work summaries, and propose preliminary plans for improving the work in the future. Then, they turned to in-depth on-site specific inspections. Minister Du Zaiheng personally went to western Liaoning to inspect water conservancy work through flood control inspection, and other division chiefs also went deep into the lower levels to inspect the work of their subordinate departments. As a result, many problems were discovered that could not be inspected in the offices, which further enriched the content of the inspection at the professional meetings. At the same time, because the responsible cadres personally went down, they were not only able to discover problems, but also to solve them in a timely manner, and to study and formulate improvement measures for some obviously unreasonable problems, which linked the inspection work with the improvement work.
    For example, in water conservancy work, the inspection during the rectification revealed that the construction plans were not accurate. This year, many river embankment construction plans were approved while sitting in the offices, without going to the site for investigation. Some were making plans while constructing, and some were making "plans" after completion; and the higher-level leading agencies lacked timely inspection. After on-site inspection, it was found that the dikes and dams were generally not up to standard, and they were urged to repair them immediately. The Raoyang River in western Liaoning Province is the only fundamental project managed by the state this year with state investment, but the responsible cadres of the Water Conservancy Bureau have not gone down to inspect it even once. The written reports of western Liaoning Province and the engineering office stated that it was "basically completed," and the Water Conservancy General Bureau also forwarded the report, but this inspection revealed that the project was not completed, only one of the six sluice gates was repaired, and a section of the river embankment in Tai'an County was one meter lower than the standard, and there was a danger of overflowing the embankment if the water was slightly higher. Therefore, after returning from the inspection, it was stipulated that in the future, water conservancy agencies at all levels must go to the site for investigation when reviewing water conservancy project plans and inspecting completed projects, the project reports must be practical, and report how much has been repaired, and do not ambiguously write "basically" completed.
    In the work of promoting new agricultural tools, in addition to inspecting the shortcomings in the promotion at the promotion meeting and making a review of the leadership responsibility, Lin Jiqing, director of the Agricultural Division, personally went to Changchun after the meeting to inspect the manufacturing of corn threshers. He tested dozens of them on the spot and found that many were not up to standard and needed to be repaired. Therefore, it was decided to stop making them, and it was stipulated that in the future, when manufacturing new agricultural tools, they should not be mass-produced and promoted unless they have been tested well. At the same time, many work teams were sent deep into the countryside to inspect what problems there were in the promotion methods and use methods of the agricultural tools that had been issued, as a basis for improving the work next year.
    Many problems have also been identified in other departments. Currently, the department is continuing to deepen the inspection work, and at the same time, in conjunction with determining the work plan for next year, is comprehensively studying the improvement measures for the future.

　　东北人民政府农林部
    结合检查主要工作深入整风
    已初步做出总结提出改进工作办法
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：经过一个半月的检查总结工作后，东北农林部及所属各处、局的整风运动已趋深入发展。目前该部对所属各处、局的主要工作，均已作出初步总结，检查出许多问题并找到了问题的症结所在。现正一面继续深入检查，一面着重研究今后改进办法。
    东北农林部的整风，一开始就正确地掌握了以检查总结当前主要工作为主的方针，并确定了检查工作的重点。这样就使整风与当前的主要工作结合起来。例如该部总的领导工作以检查水利和推广新式农具两项工作为重点。该部所属的水利局，目前正处于紧张的防汛时期，即以检查防汛为主来检查水利工作。机械农场正忙于麦收，该部就指示机械农场管理局着重检查麦收，总结出某些农场在去年麦收中损失达百分之三十的经验教训，以减少今年的损失。
    在检查当中，该部主要通过两种方法，即在专业会上检查，和负责干部深入现场检查；而这两种方法又是相互结合。整风开始以后，该部首先召集了各部门的负责干部会议，由杜者蘅部长作整风动员报告，根据领导上所了解的情况，指出各部门工作上的主要问题作为检查重点。各处、局接着即召开了一连串有关的专业会议，检查工作，作出初步工作总结，和提出今后改进工作的初步方案。然后即转为深入现场进行具体检查。杜者蘅部长亲到辽西通过检查防汛来检查水利工作，其他各处处长也都深入下层检查所属部门的工作。结果发现了许多在机关里所不能检查出来的问题，更丰富了专业会议上检查的内容。同时由于是负责干部亲自下去，不仅能够发现问题，且能及时解决问题，对有些显然不合理的问题，研究订出改进办法，这又使检查工作与改进工作结合起来。
    譬如水利工作，整风中检查结果，首先是施工计划不准确。今年许多河堤修筑计划是坐在机关里批审，没有去实地勘察，有的是一边作计划一边施工，更有的完工后才作“计划”；而上级领导机关又缺乏及时的检查。现地检查后，堤坝普遍不够标准，已督促各地立加修补。辽西省绕阳河是今年唯一由国家投资，管理的治本工程，水利局负责干部却未下去检查过一次。辽西省与工程处的书面报告上说是“基本完成”，水利总局也照报转呈，但这次下去检查才发现工程并未完成，六个闸门只修好一个，台安县内一段河堤较标准低了一公尺，水稍大便有漫堤危险。因此检查回来后就规定：今后各级水利机关审查水利工程计划及检查竣工工程，一定要亲到实地勘察，工程报告要切实，修好多少就报多少，不许含糊地写什么“基本”完成。
    新式农具推广工作，除在推广会议上检查了推广中的缺点及从领导责任上作了检讨以外，会后农业处林纪青处长又亲赴长春检查了苞米脱粒机制造情况，当场试验了几十台，发现许多不合标准，须加修理，因此决定停做，并规定今后制造新农具时，非经试验良好不许大量制造推广。同时派出许多工作组深入农村检查已发下的农具在推广方法上、使用方法上有些什么毛病，作为改进明年工作的依据。
    其他部门也都检查出许多问题。现该部正继续深入检查工作，同时结合确定明年工作方案，全面地研究今后改进工作办法。
