　　This Week's Sunday Games
    Basketball Suspended, Three Soccer Matches
    The Sunday Games jointly organized by the Beijing Municipal Sports Association, the Youth Service Department, and other units have been decided for this week. The basketball game is suspended for one week because the Cultural Palace is holding a grand get-together for soldiers, workers, and students. The soccer matches will still be held at the Dongdan Plaza, starting at 2:00 PM, with a total of three matches: (1) Chao Lian vs. Beijing Hotel Trade Union; (2) Xin Ying vs. Chong De; (3) Li Hua vs. Telecommunications Bureau.
