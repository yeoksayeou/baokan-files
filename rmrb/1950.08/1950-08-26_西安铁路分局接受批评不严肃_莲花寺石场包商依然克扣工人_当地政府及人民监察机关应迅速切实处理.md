Editor's Note: On June 14th, this newspaper published a news item titled "The Evil Consequences of Bureaucracy in the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau: Continuous Incidents at the Lotus Temple Quarry." Following this, Yuan Boyang, Acting Director of the Sub-bureau, Wang Zhiheng, Deputy Director, and Yang Shusheng, Military Representative, sent a letter to this newspaper on June 23rd, expressing their sincere acceptance of the criticism and mentioning that "the problem of contractors' extra exploitation of workers has been initially corrected." It was also reported that the Sub-bureau's Party Representative Conference had conducted a self-criticism on this issue at the end of June. However, on August 6th, this newspaper received a joint letter from the Political Department of a certain Artillery Regiment of the Military and the Huaxian County Federation of Trade Unions of Shaanxi Province, reflecting that the contractors' extra exploitation of workers at the Lotus Temple Quarry had not ceased, and the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau had not thoroughly resolved this problem. The exploitation of workers by contractors at the Lotus Temple Quarry is a cruel, feudal form of exploitation that is not allowed to exist in a New Democratic society. We hope that the leadership of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau, the local government, and the People's Supervisory Organs will inspect this issue, swiftly and effectively resolve it, resolutely safeguard the interests of the workers, and conduct necessary education or punishment of illegal contractors, and recover the illegal profits they have obtained. At the same time, the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau should conduct a serious self-examination during this rectification movement and give severe punishment to cadres like Xue Shijun. The letter from the Political Department of a certain Artillery Regiment of the Military and the Huaxian County Federation of Trade Unions is published below:

Comrade Editor:

Regarding the Lotus Temple Quarry issue, the People's Daily published a report by Comrade Chen Ji in June, raising criticisms. However, according to current understanding, apart from the issue of damage to crops, the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau has not thoroughly resolved the problem of eliminating contractor exploitation. The means by which Lotus Temple contractors exploit workers are very cruel. Workers universally reflect, "All of China is liberated, but Lotus Temple is not!"

Before the wheat harvest this year, more than 2,900 workers at the Lotus Temple Quarry were controlled by contractors Yin Yucheng (Yuji) and Li Derong (Rongji), suffering severe exploitation. These two contractors each had 1,200 workers, with the remaining 400 or so being migrant workers. The workers were mainly refugees fleeing from disaster areas, with over 300 veteran workers forming the base. During the two months from March to May this year, workers of "Yuji" and "Rongji" often worked for several months without receiving wages; instead, they owed the contractors flour. Some individuals even had their quilts and luggage confiscated by the contractors as collateral for debts. Unable to endure such severe oppression, many people left without settling their accounts when the wheat harvest arrived in May. Of the 2,500 workers of Yuji and Rongji, only over 800 remained at that time. After the workers left, the contractors seized the workers' tools as their own private property. They controlled these tools and re-issued them to new workers, again deducting tool fees from the workers' pay. At that time, the Railway Bureau, in order to smoothly complete the flood prevention tasks during the rainy season, produced a batch of tools and lent 200 iron chains and 100 footboards (each board valued at 115.11 jin of flour, each iron chain valued at 80,000 yuan) to the contractors free of charge. However, after obtaining these tools, the contractors turned them into private property and still deducted 2.4 jin of flour from workers for each cubic meter of stone as a tool fee. According to the lowest calculation, the 24 management personnel of Yuji contractor received a total of more than 1,500 jin of flour per day in tool fees, averaging 50 jin per person.

In March this year, Qin, the representative of the Materials Department of the Xi'an Railway Bureau, signed a contract with the contractors stipulating that the contractors' management personnel should not receive more than 8 to 10 jin of flour per day in wages (excluding living expenses). However, this regulation was not implemented, and the contractors continued to engage in feudal exploitation of the workers. Xue Shijun, the deputy director of the quarry, accepted bribes from contractor Guo Hongjun and colluded with the contractor to exploit the workers. Xue bought 100 packs of "Flying Wheel" cigarettes from Xi'an at a cost of over 1,000 yuan per pack, handed them over to Guo Hongjun to sell to the workers at 2,500 yuan per pack, and profited handsomely from this. From March to May this year, contractor Guo Hongjun did not pay the workers' wages for about two months. When the workers demanded settlement of accounts, the result showed that Guo owed the workers 55 bags of flour. Deputy Director Xue Shijun not only did not urge Guo to return the wages to the workers but instead came forward to protect him, convening a meeting of worker representatives on behalf of Guo to settle accounts. He erased Guo's debt of flour to the workers and instead calculated that the workers owed Guo more than 1,000 jin of flour, forcing the worker representatives to sign, but the worker representatives resolutely refused. Later, with the direct intervention of Military Representative Wang Baoquan, Guo finally returned the 55 bags of flour he owed to the workers.

After the Lotus Temple incident occurred, when Minister Qin of the Propaganda Department of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Political Department and Deputy Director Wang of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau went to the quarry in mid-May to deal with the issue of serious and unreasonable exploitation of workers by contractors, it was decided that half a jin of flour per cubic meter of stone should be deducted from the contractors' profits as a workers' welfare fund in the future. Based on 65,000 cubic meters of stone, 35,000 jin of flour should be deducted. However, this has not yet been processed.

We suggest that the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau promptly address the following issues: First, retrieve the large number of tools left behind by the workers from the contractors and use them as the property of the quarry, to be appropriately and reasonably distributed and used by the quarry trade union. Second, promptly implement Minister Qin's decision before the wheat harvest to deduct half a jin of flour per cubic meter of stone from the contractors' profits as a workers' welfare fund and hand over the flour to the trade union to carry out workers' welfare projects. Third, unconditionally recover the 26 million yuan in tool fees lent to the contractors without interest and stop issuing tool fees to the contractors. In addition, we suggest that the Huaxian leadership strengthen its leadership over the Lotus Temple Quarry and assist in establishing a trade union organization at the Lotus Temple.

　　西安铁路分局接受批评不严肃
    莲花寺石场包商依然克扣工人
    当地政府及人民监察机关应迅速切实处理
    编者按：六月十四日本报发表“西安铁路分局官僚主义的恶果，莲花寺石场连续发生事件”的消息后，该分局代理局长袁伯扬、副局长王志恒、军事代表杨树生于六月二十三日致函本报，表示诚恳接受批评，并提到“包商额外剥削工人的问题已初步纠正。”六月底，据称该分局党代表会上对这一问题也曾作检讨。但是，八月六日本报又接某军炮兵团政治处及陕西省华县县工会联名来函，反映莲花寺石场包商额外剥削工人的行为仍未停止，西安铁路分局对此问题并未彻底解决。莲花寺石场包商对工人的剥削是一种残酷的封建性质的剥削，是新民主主义社会中所不容许存在的。我们希望西安铁路分局领导方面、当地政府及人民监察机关对此问题加以检查，迅速切实予以解决，坚决维护工人利益，对不法包商应进行必要的教育或处分，追回所获得的不法利润。同时西安铁路分局，在此次整风运动中，应进行严肃的检查，对薛世俊这样的干部，应给以严厉的处分。兹将某军炮兵团政治处、陕西省华县工会的来函公布如下：
    编辑同志：
    关于莲花寺石场问题，六月份人民日报曾刊登陈迹同志报道，提出批评。但据现在了解除损害群众青苗问题已处理外，西安铁路分局对取缔包商剥削问题还没有彻底解决。莲花寺包商剥削工人的手段很残酷，工人普遍反映说：“全中国都解放啦，就是莲花寺没有解放！”
    今年麦收前，莲花寺石场二千九百多工人，操纵在殷钰成（钰记）包商和李德荣（荣记）包商手里，受着严重的剥削。他们两家包商各有一千二百工人，其余尚有四百余人是民工。工人是以灾区逃来的难民为主，以三百余老工人为基础组成。在今年三月至五月的两个多月时间内，“钰记”和“荣记”两家工人往往作了几个月的工，不但没有分得工资，反而欠了包商的面粉，个别人还被包商把被子行李扣下做为欠账的抵押。工人受不了这样严重的压榨，至五月麦收时，很多人不算账就走了，钰记、荣记两千五百多工人，当时只剩下八百多人。工人走了之后，包商把工人的工具据为私有，他们支配着这批工具，再发给新工人，又扣工人的工具费。当时，路局为了顺利完成雨季防洪任务，赶制了一批工具，无代价的借给包商铁链子二百条，踏板一百块（板一块价值一百一十五斤十一两面粉，铁链子一条八万元）。而包商得了这些工具后，又变成了私产，仍按每方石头向工人扣工具费二斤四两面。按最低的计算，钰记包商二十四个管理人员，每日所得工具费合面粉一千五百余斤，每人平均五十斤。
    今年三月间，西安路局材料处秦代表曾与包商订立合同，规定包商之管理人员日得工资（除生活费外）不得超过面粉八斤至十斤。但这种规定并未实现，包商仍继续对工人进行封建剥削。石场副主任薛世俊接受包商郭鸿俊贿赂，与包商串通剥削工人。薛从西安买回飞轮香烟一百包，买时每包一千余元，交给郭鸿俊按二千五百元一包卖给工人，从中获取厚利。今年三至五月间，包商郭鸿俊约两个多月没有给工人开支工资，工人要求算账，结果算出郭欠工人工资五十五袋面粉，副主任薛世俊不但不督促郭把工资发还给工人，反而出头包庇，代表郭召集工人代表算账，把郭欠工人的面粉，一笔抹去，反倒算成工人欠郭一千余斤面粉，并强迫工人代表签字，但工人代表坚决的拒绝了。后经军事代表王保全直接处理，郭才把所欠五十五袋面粉发还了工人。
    莲花寺事件发生后，郑州铁路局政治部宣传部秦部长和西安铁路分局王副局长在五月中前往该场处理包商对工人严重不合理的剥削问题时，曾决定从包商利润中，每方石头退回半斤面，作为今后工人福利基金，以六万五千方石头计，应扣面粉三万五千斤。但直到现在还未进行处理。
    我们建议西安铁路分局迅速处理下面几个问题：一、将工人所遗留下之大批工具，从包商手中收回，作为该场的财产，由石场工会适当的合理的支配使用。二、迅速实行麦收前秦部长关于从包商利润中每方石头扣回半斤面粉，作为工人福利基金的决定，并将该项面粉交给工会，举办工人福利事业。三、将无息借给包商的二千六百万元工具费，无条件收回；并停发包商工具费。另外，建议华县领导机关，加强对莲花寺石场的领导，并协助建立莲花寺工会组织。
