　　Over a Thousand Registered Unemployed Workers to Participate in Street Repair

　　[Beijing News Agency] Since the Beijing Unemployed Workers Relief Committee began its registration work, as of July 31st, it has registered one thousand and eighteen unemployed workers, including eight hundred and eighty-four workers and shop assistants, and one hundred and thirty-four teachers, medical workers, and general unemployed intellectuals. The Relief Office of the committee is about to distribute relief funds and begin leading participation in work-relief programs. Those who have been approved for simple relief after registration, or those who have been decided to participate in work-relief and other work but have not yet started and are experiencing special financial difficulties, will be given relief funds according to their actual situation and in accordance with the regulations of the Government Administration Council.

　　It is expected that 500 miners from Mentougou and 500 people from various districts in the city will participate in work-relief programs. It has been decided that from the 8th of this month, the main task will be to demolish old buildings that obstruct traffic and repair hutongs and streets, and work will begin.

　　After the registration work began in various districts, it was widely supported by unemployed workers, and they expressed heartfelt gratitude to the government. A worker in the 13th district said when filling out the registration form: "Only our own government can truly help us solve our difficulties. Who would have cared about you in the past!" The registered unemployed workers all hope to have work soon and, with the help of the government, use their own labor to solve their own living difficulties. They said: The government's relief funds are also the people's millet. If they have the labor but do not work and just wait for relief, it is not right. Therefore, among the thousand or so people who have registered, very few need simple relief. However, there are also individual workers who do not understand that the relief work is mainly based on work-relief, and said when registering: "Others say that the government is going to use a large amount of relief funds to help us, why do we still have to work?" In the process of carrying out the registration work, the cadres in various districts are patiently explaining and carrying out publicity work in response to these ideological situations.

　　已登记之失业工人一千余名
    即将参加修整街道
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市失业工人救济委员会办理登记工作以来，截至七月三十一日止，已登记失业工人一千零十八名，其中工人、店员八百八十四人，教员、医务工作者及一般失业知识分子一百三十四人。该会失业工人救济处即将发放救济金及开始领导参加以工代赈工作。凡在登记后已经审查批准享受单纯救济的或已决定参加以工代赈及其他工作还未开始而生活特殊困难的，均将分别按其实际情况，根据政务院的规定发给救济金。
    参加以工代赈的，预计有门头沟矿工五百名，市内各区五百名，决定自本月八日起以拆除妨碍交通的旧建筑物及修整胡同街道为主，开始工作。
    各区登记工作开始之后，受到失业工人们普遍拥护，并对政府表示由衷的感激。十三区的一个工人在填写登记表时说：“只有自己的政府，才能真正帮助我们解决困难，过去谁会管你这些！”已登记的失业工人都希望很快就有工作，在政府帮助下，用自己的劳动来解决自己的生活困难。他们说：政府救济金也是人民的小米，如果自己有劳力不工作光等着救济，是不应该的。因而在已登记的千余人中，需要单纯救济的人数很少。但也有个别的工人不了解救济工作是以以工代赈为主，在登记时说：“别人说政府要用一大批救济金救济咱们，为啥还要做工呢？”各区工作干部在进行登记工作的过程中，正针对这些思想情况即时予以耐心的解释，并进行宣传工作。
