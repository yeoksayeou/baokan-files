Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: Beijing's public factories and enterprises, in the course of production competitions, have begun to overcome the weaknesses of low quality and high costs, and have exceeded the July production plans. The competition movement began in June. Among the twenty-two larger factories and enterprises, sixteen important units, including the Shijingshan Power Plant, Shijingshan Steel Plant, Changxindian Railway Factory, Liulihe Cement Plant, Beijing Electric Power Bureau, Telecommunications Bureau, Tram Company, Water Company, and Bus Company, completed the July production plan on time, and most of them exceeded it. The product quality of many enterprises has gradually improved, and costs have also decreased. The scrap rate of pig iron at the Shijingshan Steel Plant was 19.13% in May, and the product quality in July was fully qualified. The coal washing ash content of the plant's coking department decreased from 12.5% to 9.45%, and the coke ash content decreased from 17% to 13.08%. The reduction in coke ash content played a significant role in increasing iron production and reducing iron costs. The production cost per kilowatt-hour of electricity at the Shijingshan Power Plant decreased from 0.31 jin of millet to 0.164 jin. The cost per ton of cement at the Liulihe Cement Plant also decreased from 387 jin of millet to 317 jin. With the reduction in costs, the Tram Company's July operating surplus exceeded the original plan by 101.3%, and the Bus Company, which had been losing money month by month after the takeover, also saw its July operating income exceed the original plan by 23.48%, beginning to achieve a slight surplus.

The reason why many units have been able to gradually improve product quality and reduce costs in the competition is mainly because these units have launched rationalization proposal movements and attached importance to rewarding inventors and advanced producers, greatly improving the production enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Zhang Chundi, a worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, led his co-workers to brave the high heat and enter the furnace to repair it when the insulation wall of the plant's No. 17 furnace collapsed, completing the work that would have taken three days in the past within ten hours, ensuring safe power transmission. Zhu Lin, a technician at the Bus Company, replaced charcoal vehicles with "May 1st-style gas vehicles," saving half of the fuel costs. According to statistics from more than a dozen units, workers have put forward more than 1,000 rationalization proposals and created new records.

In the production competition, the tendency to emphasize quantity over quality has not been overcome in some factories. The production responsibility system and finished product inspection system are not yet sound, and the scrap rate is still very high. The reward system in some factories is still egalitarian, and does not focus on individual rewards. Many factories do not handle rationalization proposals in a timely or appropriate manner. Some units also frequently mobilize workers to work overtime, forming a tendency towards shock work. For example, due to continuous overtime at the No. 3 Branch of the Beijing Machine Factory, the number of sick people increased, and 23 people took sick leave for two days to a week in early July. The above shortcomings have been noticed by the leading authorities and are being corrected.

### 京市公营工厂开展生产竞赛  质量提高成本降低  不少工厂超额完成上月计划

　　京市公营工厂开展生产竞赛
    质量提高成本降低
    不少工厂超额完成上月计划
    【新华社二十六日讯】北京市不少公营工厂和企业在生产竞赛中，开始克服了质量低成本高的弱点，并超额完成七月份产量计划。竞赛运动于六月开始。在二十二个较大的工厂企业中，有石景山发电厂、石景山钢铁厂、长辛店铁路工厂、琉璃河水泥厂及北京电业局、电信局、电车公司、自来水公司、公共汽车公司等十六个重要单位按时完成了七月份产量计划，其中大部并超额完成。许多企业的产品质量已逐渐提高，成本也有降低。石景山钢铁厂五月份生铁废品率为百分之十九点一三，七月份产品质量即已全部合格。该厂炼焦部洗煤灰分从百分之十二点五降至百分之九点四五，焦炭灰分从百分之十七降至百分之十三点零八。焦炭灰分的降低，对增加铁的产量和降低铁的成本起了重大作用。石景山发电厂每度电的生产成本，自零点三一斤小米降为零点一六四斤。琉琉河水泥厂每吨水泥的成本也从三百八十七斤小米降至三百一十七斤。在成本降低的情况下，电车公司七月份营业盈余超过原计划百分之一百零一点三，而接管后逐月赔损的公共汽车公司，七月份营业收入也超过原计划百分之二十三点四八，开始做到稍有盈余。
    许多单位在竞赛中所以能够做到逐渐提高产品质量降低成本，主要是由于这些单位开展了合理化建议运动，并重视对创造发明者和先进生产者的奖励工作，大大提高了职工群众的生产积极性和创造性。石景山发电厂工人张春弟，于该厂十七号炉发生保温墙倒塌事故时，带动工友冒高热钻入炉内修理，在十小时内完成了过去三天才能完成的工作，保证了安全送电。公共汽车公司技师朱临，以“五一式煤气车”代替木炭车，节省燃料费二分之一。据十几个单位的统计，职工所提合理化建议以及创造出来的新纪录达一千余件。
    在生产竞赛中，重量不重质的偏向在若干工厂还是没有克服。生产责任制和成品检验制还不健全，废品率仍然很大。有些工厂的奖励制度还是平均主义的，没有注重对个人的奖励。不少工厂对合理化建议处理不及时或处理不适当。有些单位还经常发动工人加班加点，形成突击运动的偏向。如北京机器总厂第三分厂因连续加班，病号增多，七月初请病假两天至一星期者即有二十三人。上述缺点已为领导机关所注意，正予纠正中。
