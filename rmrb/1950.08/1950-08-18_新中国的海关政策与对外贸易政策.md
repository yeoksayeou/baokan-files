New China's Customs Policy and Foreign Trade Policy
Yang Bo
　　In the past hundred years or so, under the traitorous rule of the Qing government and the Kuomintang government, the imperialist countries, with their armed economic might and enslaving treaties, infringed upon China's customs autonomy, manipulated China's foreign trade, and forced China to open treaty ports, stipulating extremely low tariffs or even exempting tariffs on goods imported into China. Imperialism took full advantage of these privileges, importing large quantities of manufactured goods into China, absorbing cheap raw materials, and using this to strangle and hinder the free development of China's national industry, making China a backward semi-colony subordinate to foreign countries for a long time. This situation of non-autonomous tariffs and non-independent foreign trade was fundamentally changed until 1949, with the basic victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War and the people's revolution throughout the country, and the era of imperialist, feudalist, and bureaucratic capitalist rule in China came to an end.

　　What are the main contents of our New Democratic customs policy and foreign trade policy? In terms of customs policy, according to the "Decision on Customs Policy and Customs Work" of the State Council of the Central People's Government, the main points are: ① For industrial products and semi-finished products that can be produced in large quantities domestically, or those that cannot be produced in large quantities for the time being but have the potential for future development, the customs tax rate should be higher than the difference between the cost of the same imported goods and the cost of the same goods in China, in order to protect national production. ② Higher tax rates should be levied on all luxury goods and non-essential goods. ③ Production equipment, industrial raw materials, agricultural machinery, grain seeds, and fertilizers, etc., that are rarely or cannot be produced domestically, should have low tax rates or be exempt from customs duties. ④ All necessary scientific books and books on the prevention and control of agricultural pests and diseases, as well as the import of certain medicines that cannot be produced domestically or cannot be replaced by domestic medicines, should be exempt from or have reduced customs duties. ⑤ In order to develop the production of our export goods, very low tax rates should be levied or tax-free exports should be allowed for all semi-finished products and processed raw materials that are encouraged by the Central People's Government.

　　In terms of foreign trade policy, according to Articles 37 and 57 of the Common Program, the main points are: "Protect all legitimate public and private trade. Implement control over foreign trade and adopt a protectionist trade policy." "The People's Republic of China may restore and develop commercial and trade relations with the governments and peoples of all foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit." In order to protect and develop domestic production, our foreign trade policy is based on the principles of "encouraging exports and limiting imports," promoting "internal and external exchange," and balancing international payments.

　　In order to implement the above-mentioned customs policy and foreign trade policy, the Customs Tariff Commission of the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government is currently formulating new unified import and export tariff regulations for the People's Republic of China. They will soon be submitted to the State Council for review and approval and then promulgated for implementation. The Ministry of Trade is also formulating unified national foreign trade management measures. Before the new unified import and export tariff regulations are promulgated and implemented, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council and local people's governments have successively made preliminary and reasonable revisions to the existing old import and export tariff regulations based on the principle of developing production and promoting economic prosperity. For example, in order to encourage the export of domestic products, all export goods within the customs are currently exempt from export duties. For goods that are exported at a loss or even at a loss, the goods tax portion can also be reduced or exempted after export. In terms of import taxes, in order to support domestic production, ensure the supply of raw materials, and reduce production costs, the import of foreign cotton is allowed to be completely exempt from customs duties in the current situation of insufficient domestic cotton production (according to the decision of the Central Financial and Economic Committee, the tax exemption period is limited to before the new cotton is on the market at the end of September this year). DDT and other pesticides for agricultural use, books, instruments, specimens, experimental equipment and their parts for scientific experiments, chemical experimental supplies, and raw materials for paper flowers imported for re-export are also allowed to be imported tax-free. The import tax rates for imported raw materials for the drawnwork industry, such as fine foreign yarn, soft foreign yarn, and Argentine yarn (re-exported), and miner's lamps, etc., have been reduced from 65% to 80% to 25% to 15%, respectively. In addition, the import tax rates for goods that can be produced in China and are not in great demand, such as iron wire round nails and hurricane lamps, have been increased from 40% to 50% to 80% to 65%, respectively.

　　In terms of foreign trade management, according to the principles of "encouraging exports and limiting imports," promoting "internal and external exchange," and balancing international payments, the current foreign trade management methods in various regions of China generally stipulate that the management of import and export goods is divided into six categories: permitted export, specially permitted export, prohibited export, and permitted import, specially permitted import, and prohibited import. The classification of various permitted import and export or prohibited import and export goods changes completely according to the changes in domestic production and consumption. In terms of exports: ① For general materials that can be produced in large quantities domestically and are more than self-sufficient, the policy of opening up foreign sales channels and encouraging exports is adopted. For example, on February 22 this year, the North China Foreign Trade Administration changed ten kinds of oils and oilseeds, such as soybean oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, peanuts, and peanut kernels, from unified sales exports to ordinary export goods, which belongs to this category. ② Materials that can be produced domestically but are not very abundant are restricted from export. Currently, cottonseed cake, rapeseed cake, and peanut cake are listed as specially permitted exports, and bran, sheep wool, and raw yellow cattle hides are temporarily suspended from export, which belongs to this category. ③ Strategic materials and a small number of materials that are not sufficient for domestic production are prohibited from export or are subject to unified sales exports. For example, the current prohibition of exports of grain, cotton, iron drums, gold, silver, and live livestock, and the unified sales exports of tungsten, antimony, tin, and metal ores, etc., belong to this category. In terms of imports: ① For industrial raw materials, equipment, and other materials that can be produced domestically and are self-sufficient, imports are prohibited in order to protect the development of domestic production. The current prohibition of imports of caustic soda, paper reels, carbon rods, alcohol, galvanized iron wire, potassium chlorate, newsprint, gypsum, sulfur, and other materials belongs to this category. ② General consumer goods that can be produced domestically and are self-sufficient are also prohibited or restricted from import, such as cotton textiles, silk textiles, seafood products, matches, and cigarettes, etc., which belong to this category. ③ All luxury goods and non-essential goods that cannot be produced domestically or are not produced sufficiently are prohibited or restricted from import, such as lipstick, nylon products, various foreign wines, and canned goods, etc., which belong to this category. ④ Various production machines, equipment, raw materials, and other materials that cannot be produced domestically or are not produced sufficiently are encouraged to be imported.

　　The foreign exchange policy, which is complementary to the foreign trade management methods, also takes the protection of domestic production, the development of foreign trade, the acquisition of foreign exchange, and the consideration of all legitimate import and export profits as the criterion for the control of exchange rates and the scale of foreign exchange supply.

　　Due to the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the implementation of the above-mentioned customs policy and foreign trade policy, not only have we recovered China's independent autonomy in customs policy and the autonomy in managing customs affairs, effectively guaranteeing the steady recovery and development of China's industrial and agricultural production, enabling domestic products to compete with foreign goods, but also China's foreign trade situation has undergone new and major changes, changing from a situation of serious import surplus in import and export trade in the past to today's balance of import and export trade, and a relative export surplus. For example, according to the statistics of the Tianjin Port Customs in 1949, the total value of import and export trade was 33,357,593 yuan in RMB, of which the export trade volume accounted for 56.8% and the import trade volume accounted for 43.2%, with a total actual export surplus of 4,537,823 yuan. According to the statistics of the General Administration of Customs, the total value of import and export trade of all ports in the country in the first half of 1950 was 919.16 billion, of which the export trade volume accounted for 57.3% and the import trade volume accounted for 42.7%, with an actual export surplus of 133.32 billion yuan. In addition, the types of import and export goods have also begun to change the old situation, especially in terms of imports, the proportion of various major production machines, equipment, chemical products, and other industrial raw materials has begun to increase, while the proportion of luxury goods and general consumer goods has been greatly reduced. This can be seen from the classified statistics of import goods in Tianjin Port in 1949 and in the whole country in 1936 and 1947.

　　Comparison Table of Major Imported Goods Classified in Tianjin Port in 1949 and in the Whole Country in 1936 and 1947:
Category				1936			1947			1949
					Percentage of Total Imports	Percentage of Total Imports	Percentage of Total Imports
Textile Fibers and Products		11.8			24.7			14.3
Metals and Products			28.4			25.0			32.1
Chemical Products and Dyes		9.9			10.7			20.8
Oils, Fats, Waxes and Products		11.2			15.5			6.8
Food, Beverages, Medicines and Tobacco	13.9			7.5			2.3

Note: The percentages for 1936 and 1947 are for the whole country, and the percentage for 1949 is for Tianjin Port only.

　　It can be seen from the above table that the proportion of materials such as production equipment, machines, and chemical products in our imported goods after liberation has increased compared with the past, while the import of luxury goods and consumer goods such as food, beverages, and tobacco has been greatly reduced compared with the past. The actual imported goods in the first half of this year and the barter contracts signed by the Ministry of Trade with the Soviet Union and other new democratic countries were mostly means of production such as industrial and agricultural production machines, equipment, and raw materials.

　　Combining the main contents of our customs policy and foreign trade policy mentioned above and the actual implementation, it is not difficult to understand that the formulation and implementation of our New Democratic customs policy and foreign trade policy are entirely based on protecting and developing China's industrial and agricultural production, protecting people's property, and building an independent, free, and prosperous New Democratic economic system. Its important role in protecting the development of China's industry is just as Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out in his speech at the cadre conference celebrating May Day in Beijing: "Imperialism has been driven out of China, many of the privileges of imperialism in China have been abolished, and New China's customs policy and foreign trade policy have become important tools for protecting the development of New China's industry. That is to say, we have put the key to China's door in our own pockets, not in the pockets of imperialism and its lackeys as in the past. From now on, China's industry will not be subject to the competition of cheap goods from imperialism, and China's raw materials will first be supplied to the needs of its own industry. This has removed one of the biggest obstacles that have prevented China's industry from developing for a hundred years."

　　新中国的海关政策与对外贸易政策
　　杨波
    过去的一百多年当中，在满清政府与国民党政府丧权辱国的反动统治下，各帝国主义国家以武装的经济的力量及奴役式的条约，侵犯了我国的海关自主权，操纵了我国的对外贸易，强迫我国开辟商埠，规定以极低的关税甚至免除关税向我国输入商品。帝国主义充分利用了这些特权，大量地向我国输入生产品，吸收廉价原料，并借此绞杀和阻碍了我国民族工业的自由发展，使我国长期变为落后的从属外国的半殖民地。这种关税不自主，对外贸易不独立的状况，直至一九四九年随着我人民解放战争和人民革命在全国范围内取得了基本胜利，帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义在中国的统治时代宣告结束而获得基本改变。
    我新民主主义的海关政策与对外贸易政策的主要内容是什么呢？在海关政策方面，根据中央人民政府政务院“关于关税政策和海关工作的决定”的规定，主要为：①在国内能大量生产的或者暂时还不能大量生产但将来有发展可能的工业品及半制品，于进口同样的这些商品时，海关税率应规定高于该项商品的成本与我国同样货品的成本间之差额，以保护国家民族生产。②对于一切奢侈品和非必需品，订征更高的税率。③在国内生产很少或者不能生产的生产设备器材、工业原料、农业机械、粮食种籽及肥料等，其税率要低或免征关税。④凡一切必需的科学图书与防治农业病虫害等书籍，以及若干国内不能生产的或国内药品所不能代替的药品的输入，免征或减征关税。⑤为了发展我国的出口货物的生产，对于经由中央人民政府所奖励的一切半制品及加工原料的输出，只订很低的税率或免税输出。
    在对外贸易政策方面，根据共同纲领第三十七条与第五十七条的规定，主要为：“保护一切合法的公私贸易。实行对外贸易的管制，并采用保护贸易政策。”，“中华人民共和国可在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系。”为保护与发展国内的生产事业，我们对外贸易政策的掌握是以“奖出限入”，促进“内外交流”平衡国际收支为原则的。
    为贯彻上述海关政策与对外贸易政策，中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会所属之关税税则委员会，正在厘订中华人民共和国新的统一的出进口关税税则，不久将经过政务院审核批准，公布执行，中央贸易部亦正在制订全国统一的对外贸易管理办法。在新的统一的出进口关税税则尚未公布施行前，政务院财经委员会及各地人民政府，根据发展生产、繁荣经济的原则，对现行的旧的出进口关税税则，已先后初步进行了部分的合理的订正。如：为鼓励国产品的输出，目前关内一切出口的货物，一律免征出口关税，凡出口无利甚至赔本的货物，出口后其货物税部分，亦准予减征或免征，在进口税方面为扶助国内生产，保证原料供应，减低生产成本，在目前国产棉花不足的情况下，外棉的进口准予全部免征关税（根据中央财委会的决定，此项免税期限，规定为今年九月底新棉上市以前为限），农业用的ＤＤＴ等杀虫药剂，科学实验用的图书、仪器、标本、实验用器械及其零件，化学实验用品，为复制出口而进口之纸花原料等，亦皆准予免税进口。抽纱工业用之细洋纱、软洋纱、亚根地纱等进口原料（复制出口），矿工用灯等，其进口税率则分别由百分之六十五至八十，减至百分之二十五至十五。此外为我国可能生产的及需要不大的铁丝圆钉、风灯等货物，其进口税率，则分别由百分之四十至五十，提高至百分之八十至六十五。
    在对外贸易管理方面，根据“奖出限入”，促进“内外交流”及平衡国际收支的原则，我各地现行之对外贸易管理办法中，对出进口货物的管理，一般皆规定为：准许出口、特许出口、禁止出口与准许进口、特许进口、禁止进口六类。各种准许出进口或禁止出进口货物的分类，则完全根据国内生产与消费情况的变化而变化。在出口方面：①凡国内能大量生产且自给有余的一般物资，皆采打开国外销路，鼓励输出的方针。如本年二月二十二日华北对外贸易管理局将豆油、棉子油、花生油、花生米、花生果等十种油类与油料，由统销出口改为普通出口货物，即属于此类。②国内可以生产但敷余不多的物资，即限制输出。目前棉子饼、菜子饼、花生饼等列为特许出口范围，麸皮、绵羊毛、生黄牛皮等暂停出口，即属于此类。③凡属战略物资及国内生产不足自用的少数物资，则实行禁止出口，或统销出口。如目前粮食、棉花、铁桶、金、银、活牲口的禁止输出，钨、锑、锡、金属矿砂等统销出口，即属于此类。在进口方面：①凡国内可以生产并能自给的工业原料、器材等物资，为保护本国生产的发展，即禁止进口。目前的烧碱、盘纸、炭精杆、酒精、镀锌铁丝、氯酸钾、白报纸、石膏、硫磺等物资的禁止进口，即属于此类。②国内可以生产并能自给的一般生活消费品，亦禁止进口或限制进口，如棉织品、丝织品、海产品、火柴、纸烟等即属于此类。③一切奢侈品与国内不能生产或生产不足的非必需品，则禁止进口或限制进口。如口红、尼龙制品、各种洋酒、罐头等即属于此类。④凡为我国内不能生产或生产不足的各种生产机器、器材、原料等物资，即奖励输入。
    与对外贸易管理办法相辅而行的外汇政策，其牌价的掌握，供汇的尺度等，亦同样是以保护国内生产事业，开展对外贸易，争取外汇，兼顾一切正当的出进口利润为准绳的。
    由于中国人民大革命的伟大胜利与上述海关政策、对外贸易政策的实施，不但已收回了我国在关税政策方面的独立自主权及管理海关事业的自主权，有力的保障了我国工农业生产事业得以稳步的恢复与发展，使本国的生产品能与外国商品进行竞争，而且已使我国的对外贸易状况，发生了新的重大变化，由过去多年来进出口贸易额严重入超的形势改变为今天出进口贸易额的平衡，并有相对的出超。如天津港一九四九年海关的统计，出进口贸易总值人民币三三，三五七，五九三万元，其中出口贸易额占百分之五六·八，进口贸易额占百分之四三·二，共计实际出超四，五三七，八二三万元。另据海关总署统计，一九五○年上半年全国各港口出进口贸易总值为九一，九一六亿，其中出口贸易额占百分之五七·三，进口贸易额占百分之四二·七，实际出超一三，三三二亿元。此外在出进口货物种类上，亦开始改变着旧的状况，特别在进口方面，各种主要生产机器，器材，化学产品及其它工业原料等的比重已开始增大，而奢侈品，一般消费品的比重则大为缩小。这从天津港一九四九年与一九三六、一九四七年全国的进口货分类统计中，即可窥见一斑。
    天津港一九四九年与一九三六、一九四七年全国主要进口货分类比较表：类别                一九三六年    一九四七年    一九四九年
                    占进口总值    占进口总值    占进口总值
                    百分比        百分比        百分比纺织纤维及其制品类  一一·八      二四·七      一四·三金属及其制品类      二八·四      二五·○      三二·一化学产品及染料类    九·九        一○·七      二○·八油、脂、腊及其制品类一一·二      一五·五      六·八食品、饮料、药材及烟草类一三·九  七·五        二·三
    注：一九三六、一九四七年系全国的百分比，一九四九年系天津港一地的百分比。
    从上表中可以看出，解放后我们的进口货物中，生产器材、机器及化学产品等物资的比重，较过去是增加了，而食品、饮料、烟草等奢侈品及生活消费品的进口，则较过去大大减少了。今年上半年全国的实际进口货物及中央贸易部与苏联及其它新民主主义国家所签订的易货合同中，亦大部分为工农业生产机器、器材、原料等生产资料。
    综合上述我们的关税政策与对外贸易政策的主要内容，及其实施的情况，不难了解我们新民主主义的关税政策及对外贸易政策的制订与实施，完全是以保护发展我国工农业生产，保护人民财产，建设独立的、自由的、繁荣的新民主主义经济体系为基础的；其对保护我国工业发展所起的重要作用，正如刘少奇副主席在北京庆祝五一劳动节干部大会上演说所指出的：“帝国主义已经从中国赶走，帝国主义在中国的许多特权已经被取消，新中国的海关政策与对外贸易政策已经成为保护新中国工业发展的重要工具。这就是说，我们已把中国大门的钥匙放在自己的袋子里，而不是如过去一样放在帝国主义及其走狗的袋子里。从今以后，中国工业就不致受到帝国主义的廉价商品的竞争，中国的原料将首先供给自己工业的需要。这就扫除了一百年来使中国工业不能发展的一个最大的障碍”。
