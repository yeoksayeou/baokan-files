    China's Peace Signature Campaign Expands to Rural Areas
    Farmers Everywhere Reflect: The Fruits of Emancipation Must Be Secure, Peace Must Be Consolidated.
    [This Newspaper News] A comprehensive report from various locations: Currently, the national signature campaign to defend world peace has expanded from large cities to small and medium-sized cities, and is now penetrating into rural areas.

    According to incomplete statistics, more than twenty provinces and three hundred and nineteen counties (many special zones and provinces have not listed the number or names of counties, and are not included here) across the major administrative regions of the country have launched rural peace signature campaigns.

    In Datong City, Shanxi Province, according to statistics from early August, 80,000 citizens had signed the Peace Declaration. In the twelve counties of Yanbei, the number of signatories reached 618,000. Amidst the widespread enthusiasm for peace, women's responses were particularly enthusiastic. An old woman, a soldier's family member, holding her grandson, watched the photo exhibition and said to the comrades at the signature table: "Please sign my name for me! What was the point of Niu'er's father risking his life to fight against old Chiang? Wasn't it for everyone to live in peace?"

    In Hubei Province, with the active promotion of comrades in the various counties, the peace signature campaign has gradually expanded from points to areas. The Hubei Branch of the China Peace Committee also sent groups to three special zones to promote the work in the countryside and gain experience. As of August 1, out of the 71 counties in the province, 44 counties had reported their work to the provincial branch. The branch receives numerous letters, telegrams, declarations, and messages of support and condolence to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Korean People's Army from factories, rural areas, military units, schools, organs, and organizations in various counties and districts of Hubei every day, expressing full concern and love. The people's just calls against American imperialist aggression resound in every rural corner.

    In Lanzhou, 88% of the city's population has signed. The current stage of the peace signature campaign focuses on the agricultural areas of the fourth to ninth districts. Farmers are currently busy harvesting wheat, and the Yangko propaganda team of the ninth district's primary school, in coordination with the district and township cadres, take turns going to the villages to mobilize signatures. More than 95% of the farmers in the ninth district have signed. Poor peasant Tang Guoren resolutely stated: "I must cultivate intensively and produce diligently, and use this hoe of mine to strike against American imperialism."

    Farmers' ideological understanding improved a step further in the peace signature campaign

    Farmers' ideological understanding has generally improved a step further in the peace signature campaign, and many moving events have emerged. For example, in Xiyouli Village, Fuyang County, Zhejiang, someone came from three miles away in the middle of the night with a lantern to sign. Farmers in Yuejiazhai Village in the suburbs of Xi'an automatically set up a World Peace Signature Station next to the village road, publicized it and called on passers-by to sign. Those pushing grain carts and vendors selling charcoal and vegetables happily signed. Shang Fazi, a farmer in Daluo Village, Yichang, Hubei, led his entire family to sign, saying: "The more names signed, the more secure the fruits of emancipation." Gu Xiumei, a military family member in the village, asked someone to sign for her and even requested them to write: "I firmly oppose wars of aggression and work hard to produce to defend world peace." Farmers in the suburbs of Wuhan enthusiastically responded to the peace signature campaign amidst the intense production movements of cutting wheat, planting fields, plowing fields, and transplanting rice seedlings. Luo Xizhen, a rural woman in Yuyue District, Jiayu County, said: "We must also rectify the peasant associations, develop organizational strength, do a good job in land reform, and consolidate peace." The district held a peasant representative conference on July 23. After publicity and discussion, peasant representative Tang Damei said: "America is really a paper tiger. In just half a month, the Korean people have exposed its true colors."

    The 1,018 farmers in Longren Township, Jiangbei County, Sichuan, wrote in front of the signature book: "We, the people of Jiangbei County, are working hard to restore and develop production, heal the wounds of war, and practically experience that peace is extremely precious. Therefore, we have launched this peace signature campaign to express our determination and strength to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression, and solemnly warn those war-mongers: whoever violates the will of the world's people and provokes a new war is a war criminal and our common enemy, and we will resolutely impose effective sanctions on them!..."

    This vividly illustrates that today's movement to defend world peace also has a broad and deep mass base in the countryside, and how much the simple and honest Chinese farmers yearn for a peaceful life!

    Because rural areas have different characteristics from cities and the objects of work are different, the methods and approaches to work are also different.

    Experience in carrying out peace signature work in rural areas

    To date, there are no relatively complete reports on carrying out peace movements in rural areas in various places. Here, we can only introduce some fragmented experiences.

    1. According to experience (propaganda and education work is relatively arduous), it is not enough to rely solely on holding large meetings and making general appeals. Repeated publicity should be carried out through various meetings such as peasant representative conferences, women's association meetings, door-to-door gatherings, and forums, and individual ideological work should be done. Impatience and formalism must be avoided. For example, the propaganda methods in Liaodong Province are extremely popular and rich, and have penetrated into the daily lives of the masses, including visiting relatives, field meetings, chatting while enjoying the cool, and propaganda at the ridges.

    2. The peasant association is a relatively broad mass organization in rural areas. Grasping this link and combining it with other mass organizations to carry out mobilization and publicity work has proven to be very successful in various places. In many villages in Yidu County, the peasant association launched a Defend Peace Conference, and the peasants, whose political awareness had been greatly raised by the rent reduction and anti-hegemony movement, enthusiastically participated in this movement.

    3. According to experience, when carrying out propaganda work, many ideological problems will inevitably be discovered. Therefore, it is extremely important to establish a certain organization to unify leadership, in order to collect information in a timely manner, solve problems, break down obstacles, and smoothly carry out the work.

    When Kaixian County, Sichuan, initially launched the peace signature campaign, the leadership did not give it due attention, resulting in a laissez-faire situation, giving special agents an opportunity to spread rumors and causing misunderstandings among the masses. After discovering these situations, the party, government, military, and civilian units of the county specially held an enlarged propaganda mass meeting at the sports ground outside the city on July 17. The heads of the various units made detailed and clear explanations in response to the concerns of the masses, and set up seven signature stations on the main streets, organized propaganda teams to set out separately to publicize. Within three days, one-fifth of the county's population had signed, and the movement is still continuing.

    4. Mobilizing urban and rural schools to organize propaganda teams to carry out in-depth publicity without hindering learning is a powerful force. For example, Beijing organized students to go to the countryside to publicize using various recreational forms, and the results were extremely good.

    5. The content of propaganda should be closely integrated with the lives of the masses and with the current life. It is important to emphasize that only peace can improve our lives; recall the pain suffered in the past during the years of the Japanese and Chiang bandit gang's wars of aggression to inspire people's desire for peace. In Yanliuzhuang, next to the Shahe River in Henan, 85-year-old Liu Chang's son was captured by the Kuomintang and used as cannon fodder, and his body was thrown in a foreign land. When he signed, he thought of his own flesh and blood and burst out from the bottom of his heart with hatred for the aggressive wars that harmed the people, and wrote the names of all five members of his family on the peace signature book.

    6. Closely integrating propaganda and mobilization with mass production is an extremely important link. For example, in Mazhong District, Mianchi County, Henan, cadres were dispersed and went deep into the farmers to seize free time to talk and publicize, helping farmers thresh and harvest, and carrying out propaganda during labor. Female comrades personally picked up wheat with the poor peasants, and the masses were extremely satisfied and accepted the content of the propaganda.

    7. In terms of propaganda methods, choose those familiar and welcome to the masses, such as Yangko opera, rural living newspapers, crosstalk, local ditties, etc., and use temple fairs, teahouses, and markets to make current affairs speeches, or use blackboards, picture albums, photo exhibitions, school parent-teacher conferences, etc., to absorb the masses. For example, in Dongyezhen, Wutai County, while a play was being performed at a mass temple fair, the comrades working in the district, in coordination with college students, organized a propaganda team, and set up signature places everywhere to carry out speeches. Within three days, more than 4,000 people signed.

    Our vast countryside possesses a strong potential revolutionary force, which has been repeatedly proven in the long years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. Today's struggle for peace will once again demonstrate its unparalleled and powerful force.

### 我国和平签名运动向农村扩展  各地农民反映：翻身果实要牢靠，必须有巩固的和平。

　　我国和平签名运动向农村扩展
    各地农民反映：翻身果实要牢靠，必须有巩固的和平。
    【本报讯】综合各地来信：目前全国保卫世界和平的签名运动已由大城市到中小城市而深入到农村了。
    据不完全的材料统计，全国各大行政区已有二十多个省，三百十九个县（尚有很多专区及省未列举县数或县名者不在内），已展开了农村的和平签名运动。
    山西大同市据八月初的统计已有八万市民在和平宣言上签了名。雁北十二县签名者达六十一万八千人。在群众普遍拥护和平的热潮中，妇女的反应尤为热烈，一个军属老太太抱着孙儿看完图片展览，对签名台的工作同志说：“请你替我签上名吧！牛儿的爸爸当兵舍命打老蒋为的是什么？还不是为的人人能过太平日子。”
    湖北省的和平签名运动在各县工作同志的积极推动下，已经由点逐渐向面扩展。中国保卫和平大会湖北分会还派了小组到三个专区下乡去推动工作，取得经验。至八月一日止，全省七十一县中，已有四十四县向省分会汇报工作。该分会每日收到许多来自湖北各县各区工厂、农村、部队、学校、机关、团体的信件、通电、声明，以及致中国人民解放军及朝鲜人民军的声援和慰问，表现充分的关切和热爱，人民反对美帝侵略的正义呼声响彻了每个乡村角落。
    兰州全市人口有百分之八十八签了名。现阶段的和平签名运动以四至九农业区为重点。农民现正忙于收麦，九区小学的秧歌宣传队配合区乡干部，轮流到各村动员签名。九区农民百分之九十五以上都签了名。贫农唐国仁坚决地说道：“我一定要深耕细作，努力生产，拿我这把锄头打击美国帝国主义。”
    农民在和平签名运动中思想认识提高一步
    农民在和平签名运动中思想认识上普遍地提高了一步，并涌现了不少动人的事实。如浙江富阳县西邮里村半夜里有人从三里外打着灯笼来签名。西安城郊岳家寨农民自动在本村大道旁，设了保卫世界和平签名处，宣传并叫路人签名，推粮车的，卖木炭、青菜的小贩都高高兴兴地签了名。湖北宜昌大罗村农民尚发子带领全家人签名，他说：“签名的名字愈多，翻身果实愈牢靠。”该村军属谷秀梅请人代她签名，更要求替她写上：“我坚决反对侵略战争，努力生产保卫世界和平。”武汉城郊农民在紧张的割麦、种田、犁田、插秧等生产运动中，一听到和平签名就热烈响应。嘉鱼县鱼岳区农村妇女罗喜珍说：“还要把农协整顿好，发展组织力量，搞好土改，巩固和平。”该区七月二十三日开农代会，经过宣传讨论，农民代表汤大梅说：“美国真是个纸老虎，只半个月，朝鲜人民就叫他露了原形。”
    四川江北县隆仁乡一千零十八个农民在签名册前面写道：“我们江北县的人民正在努力恢复与发展生产，医治战争创伤，实际体念到和平是至堪宝贵的，所以发起这次和平签名运动，把自己保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争的决心和力量表现出来，严正警告那些战贩们：谁要违背世界人民的意志，挑拨新战争，谁就是战犯，就是我们的公敌，我们将坚决予以有效的制裁！……”
    这生动地说明了今天的保卫世界和平运动在农村里也有广泛深厚的群众基础，淳厚朴实的中国农民是多么渴望着和平的生活！
    由于农村与城市有不同的特点，工作的对象不同，所以在工作的方法方式上也有所不同。
    农村开展和平签名工作经验
    各地到现在为止尚没有较完整的农村开展和平运动报告，这里只能介绍一些零碎的经验。
    一、根据经验（宣传教育工作是比较艰苦的），单靠开开大会作一般号召是不够的，要通过各种会议如农代会，妇女会，门头集会，座谈会等反复宣传，个别的搞通思想，决不能性急，而流于形式。如辽东省宣传方式极为通俗丰富，渗透到了群众日常生活中去，有走亲戚，地头会，乘凉唠喀，垅头宣传。
    二、农会是农村较广泛的群众组织，抓住这一环，结合别的群众团体，来进行动员宣传工作，各地都证明成绩很好。宜都县许多村庄由农会发起召开保卫和平大会，因减租反霸运动而政治觉悟大为提高的农民热烈地参加了这一运动。
    三、根据经验，当开展宣传工作时，一定会发掘出很多思想问题，所以成立一定的组织来统一领导是极重要的，以便及时收集情况，解决问题，打破阻碍，顺利开展工作。
    四川开县起初发动和平签名运动时，领导上未予以应有的重视，形成自流，使特务有机会造谣，群众发生误解。该县党、政、军、民各单位发现了这些情况后，特于七月十七日在城外运动场召开扩大宣传群众大会，由各单位首长针对群众顾虑作了详尽而明白的解释，并在各冲要街道设置了七个签名站，组织宣传队分头出发宣传，三天之内，全县人口有五分之一签了名，运动至今仍在继续进行中。
    四、动员城市、乡村学校，在不妨碍学习下组织宣传队深入宣传，是一支力量强大的队伍。如北京组织学生下乡宣传利用各种游艺形式成绩极好。
    五、宣传内容要密切结合群众生活，结合目前生活。要着重说明：只有和平，才能提高我们的生活；回忆过去遭受日本、蒋匪帮侵略战争年代所受的痛苦，来启发人们要求和平的热望。河南沙河旁边一个阎刘庄，八十五岁的刘昌老太爷，他的儿子被国民党抓去当炮灰，尸首抛在异乡。在他签名时，想起了自己亲身骨肉，从心内迸发出对残害人民的侵略战争的仇恨，把全家五口的名字都写在和平签名书上。
    六、密切结合群众生产来进行宣传动员，是极重要的环节。如河南渑池县马忠区，把干部分散深入到农民中去，抓紧空闲时间谈来宣传，帮助农民打场、收割，在劳动中进行宣传。女同志亲自与贫苦农民一道拾麦，群众反映极满意也接受了宣传内容。
    七、在宣传方式上要择群众所熟悉的、欢迎的，如秧歌剧、农村活报、双簧、地方小调等，并可利用庙会、茶馆、市场作时事演讲，或以黑板报、画刊、图片展览、学校恳亲会等等，来吸收群众。如五台县东冶钲，正在群众庙会演戏的当中，该区工作同志配合高校学生，组织了宣传队，分头进行演讲，到处设置了签名处，三天内即有四千余人签名。
    我们的广大农村潜在着强大的革命力量，这在过去长期的抗日战争和解放战争年代中已经一再证明。今天争取和平的斗争，将再一次地显示它无比强大的力量。
