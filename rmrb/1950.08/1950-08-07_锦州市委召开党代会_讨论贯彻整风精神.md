The Jinzhou Municipal Party Committee convened a Party Congress to Discuss Implementing the Rectification Spirit

[By Our Correspondent] The Jinzhou Municipal Party Committee, in order to strengthen its leadership over the rectification study in various units, convened symposiums of responsible cadres from various units on rectification. It conducted detailed research on the key points of the rectification plans of each unit and resolved many specific issues. For example, at the symposium of factory and enterprise departments, it was promptly discovered that the rectification at the Synthetic Oil Refinery had taken some detours because it failed to start with an examination of the work itself, instead focusing on generalized self-criticism of individual ideological style. The symposium promptly criticized and corrected this. In order to clarify that rectification must be combined with current work, the Jinzhou Municipal Party Committee convened the city's third Party Congress on July 26 to report on and discuss the spirit of carrying out rectification centered around current work; and to summarize the main work of the second quarter, so that the city's rectification movement could unfold normally and rapidly.

　　锦州市委召开党代会
    讨论贯彻整风精神
    【本报讯】锦州市委为加强对各单位整风学习的领导，曾分别召开各单位负责干部整风座谈会，对各单位整风计划要点，都作了详细的研究，并解决了很多具体问题。例如在工厂企业部门座谈会上，及时发现了合成炼油厂的整风，由于未能首先从检查工作着手，而偏重于个人思想作风的一般化的检讨，因此走了一些弯路。座谈会对此作了及时的批判和纠正。锦州市委为了明确整风必须与当前工作结合，曾于七月二十六日召开全市第三次党代会议，报告与讨论了贯彻围绕当前工作进行整风的精神；并总结第二季度主要工作，以便全市整风运动正常地迅速地展开。（马岑华）
