　　Northeast Spring Salt Production Exceeds 360,000 Tons

　　Northeast China's spring salt production has concluded, with a total output of 360,320 tons, completing 54.9% of this year's task. Among them, the salt fields under the Guandong Aquatic Products Company exceeded the spring production task by 15.05%, completing 91.95% of the annual production task. Since salt production began in March this year, the quality of salt in various salt fields has generally improved, and the quality of first-class salt has more than doubled compared with the puppet Manchukuo era. In terms of salt production methods, the old practice of using 30-degree brine for salt production, which has been popular in salt fields for more than 200 years, has been broken, and it has been replaced by the method of using 28.5-degree drainage brine for salt production. As a result, the salt grains produced are large, white, and relatively dry. Now, the salt fields in various places are actively repairing the fields to prepare for the autumn sun-drying, and the autumn sun-drying of some salt fields has already begun.

　　Northeast Spring Fishing Exceeds Original Plan

　　Northeast China has achieved great success in its spring fishing this year. Fishermen and aquatic products companies in coastal saltwater fish producing areas such as Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Lushun-Dalian have caught a total of more than 56,900 tons of various fish this year, exceeding the production task for the first half of this year by more than 24%. The main production periods of inland freshwater fish in Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Jilin and other places are in autumn and winter every year. From the beginning of the year to the present, more than 27% of the annual production plan has been completed. It is estimated that the plan to catch more than 121,600 tons of fish in the entire Northeast region this year can be overfulfilled.
