　　The Rebirth of Seoul
    Soviet Union, Konilov
    People are moving into the city from all directions. They crossed the shallows, bypassed bridges destroyed by the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit troops, forded streams, descended treacherous mountain paths, and traversed low-lying rice paddies. Those walking included children, women, and the elderly. They pushed carts loaded with simple furniture or whipped oxen pulling light oxcarts at a slow pace.
    Everyone's eyes were fixed on the city, bathed in sunlight and adorned with the tricolor flag bearing a five-pointed star. The peaceful residents of Seoul were returning to their beloved hometown, ready to begin a new and free life in this liberated city. Many of them had endured the pain of searching for work during the long five years of unemployment, darkness, hunger, and tyranny. They were eager to immediately join the ranks of those fighting for the happiness of the motherland on the front lines and in the rear.
    In the office of Li Chengye (Ri Seung-yeop), Chairman of the Seoul Provisional People's Committee, many people gathered. From morning till night, representatives from all walks of life came to him with various suggestions, opinions, and requests.
    The people of Seoul were very familiar with Li Chengye. He worked underground for many years during the period of Japanese occupation. The leaflets he wrote, earnestly calling for the struggle for the people's happiness, were passed around and secretly read in many anti-Japanese groups. He overcame many difficulties to find the guerrillas and helped them awaken village after village, fighting the hateful enemy.
    When the American bosses were the masters of South Korea, Li Chengye continued his glorious cause.
    The American occupation authorities issued an order – to arrest Li Chengye; they set an extremely high reward for his head. But among the Korean people, no one was willing to sell out their true friend for money.
    On the day of Seoul's liberation, Li Chengye spoke in front of the People's Committee hall, and 600,000 people listened to his impassioned words about the new free Seoul and the new free life that everyone should build together.
    Now he was sitting alive and well in the same room where the American colonialists had issued the order for his immediate arrest. The door to his office could hardly be closed, as people constantly came to the mayor of this newly liberated city.
    A group of teachers came in, with two important issues. Five years ago, an industrial university was opened in Seoul, with an attached research institute and machine repair factory. It actually trained Japanese engineers. Korean children were not allowed to enter. After the Soviet army drove the Japanese invaders out of Korea, the industrial university also turned over. But two weeks later, the American occupation forces landed in the south, and the American occupation authorities closed the university. They dismantled and transported machine tools and equipment, turning classrooms and research institutes into barracks.
    "Korea has no industry, and we don't need it," one American official declared. "Everything we need will be shipped from the United States. Korea's task is to develop raw materials."
    The industrial university was thus cut short. A painful fate also befell the higher girls' school. An elderly female teacher, who had been dismissed before liberation for being "willful and stubborn," quietly recounted how drunken American officers broke into classrooms and dragged away pretty girls; some female students committed suicide after this humiliation.
    Now the teachers were reporting that they were starting to restore the industrial university. In the girls' school, where the American terror had scattered all the female students, some students had gathered, and new teachers had been appointed.
    After the teachers, workers from the cigarette factory came in. Despite the serious damage to the enterprise, they were among the first to resume work in the city. The cigarette workers also brought Li Chengye a few boxes of newly produced cigarettes. The trademark was still the old one, but the boxes had a small star drawn by hand, like the one on the flag of free Korea. The workers said that they had repaired the damaged workshops with their own efforts.
    Another workers' delegation – was a group of shoe workers from a small rubber shoe factory. Worker Li Huanjun (transliteration) said that their owner was a Korean rich man who had fled with the Americans. The workers had organized themselves to protect the factory, concealing the finished products and stored raw materials.
    "Our raw materials are enough for a month, we just need to appoint a factory director and please tell us where to send our finished products?" Li Huanjun said very solemnly.
    Li Chengye expressed his gratitude for their spirit of protecting state property and instructed them on how to proceed in the future.
    Railway employees also came in; they were greeted with particular enthusiasm, because their day and night labor had repaired some of the destroyed bridges, facilitating the movement of military trains to the places where the People's Army was dealing heavy blows to the enemy.
    Track inspector Li Quanjie (transliteration) called on his comrades to repair a bridge in the Gyeong'an district in the hot June weather when the People's Army was pursuing the fleeing enemy from Seoul. According to experts, this project would require at least two days and nights if 2,000 people participated, but 1,500 drivers, railway technicians, firemen, and switchmen completed the project in just twelve hours. Today, railway employees reported that another bridge had been repaired in the Han River area.
    The conversation with the mayor was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone. The director of the city telecommunications bureau reported that postmen had begun delivering letters, telegrams, and newly published newspapers today.
    A communicator brought Li Chengye a letter, and a smile flashed on his face.
    "The textile joint company has begun to produce the first batch of cloth," he said, "Previously, there were six hundred workers working there, now – eight hundred people, and they have launched an over-quota labor competition under the banner of everything for victory."
    Exciting life is boiling in the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - Seoul. The trams, which started running on the streets on the fourth day after liberation, are running, cars are running, and enterprises are being restored one after another.
    Construction workers have also started working; they are repairing roads and sidewalks. Two new workers' dormitories and a large residence are under construction.
    Theaters, cinemas, and shops have started working. Guests from Pyongyang – theater actors – have come to Seoul.
    No matter how brutally the American planes bomb, the people of Seoul are stubbornly building their beautiful city.
    Every day, countless youth teams parade in front of the Seoul Provisional People's Committee. They carry banners and flags with slogans written in Korean: "We are going to defend the motherland," "We volunteer to go to the front," "We are holding guns in our hands, we want to join our ranks."
    In a few days, more than two thousand Seoul youths went to the front. They are heading south, to the heroic People's Army that is fighting for the freedom and independence of the motherland.
    They are going to defend the tricolor people's flag, to defend the flag of liberation that flies over the free Seoul.

### 汉城的新生

　　汉城的新生
    苏联  科尼洛夫
    人们从各方面向城市里移动着。他们经过了浅滩，越过了被李承晚匪军所破坏的桥梁，横渡了小溪，走下了险峻的山路，穿过了低湿的稻田。行走的有小孩、妇女、老人。他们向前推着满载简朴家具的小车，或是鞭着拖了轻便牛车缓步走的牛。
    大家的眼睛注视着阳光普照下饰有五角星的三色旗帜的城市。汉城的和平居民回到亲爱的故乡，要在这自由的城市里，开始新的自由生活。其中很多人是在失业、黑暗、饥饿与专制的漫长的五年岁月中饱尝了寻找工作的痛苦的。他们现在巴不得立刻走进那些在前线与后方为祖国的幸福而战斗的人们的行列里。
    在汉城市临时人民委员会主席李承烨的办公室里，聚集了很多人。从早到夜，一直有各阶层的代表们带着各种的建议、意见和请求来找他。
    汉城人对李承烨是很熟识的。在日寇侵占时期他在地下工作了多年。他写的那些传单，热诚地号召着为人民的幸福而斗争的，到处被传递着看，并在很多的抗日小组内被偷偷地读。他排除了很多的困难找到游击队，便帮助他们唤起一个又一个新的乡村，对仇恨的敌人进行斗争。
    当美国老板做着南朝鲜的主人的时候，李承烨仍然继续着自己的光荣事业。
    美国占领当局颁发了命令——通缉李承烨；为他的头定出了极高的悬奖。但在朝鲜人民当中，没有找到愿意为金元而出卖自己真正朋友的人。
    汉城解放那天，李承烨在人民委员会的厅前演说，六十万人听着他那激动的演词，关于自由的新汉城，关于大家应当共同携手来建立的新的自由生活的。
    现在他就在美国殖民者发布过立即逮捕李承烨命令的那个屋子里健全如常地活生生坐着。他的办公室的门简直关不住，人们老是向这新解放的城市的市长那里走来走去。
    走进了一伙教员，他们有两个很重要的问题。五年前在汉城开设过工业大学，附有研究所与机械修造厂。那儿实际上培养着日本工程师。朝鲜子弟是不得进去的。在苏联军队从朝鲜赶走了日寇之后，工业大学也翻身了。但过了两个星期，美国占领军在南部登陆了，美国占领当局便封闭了这所大学。他们把机床与机器，拆散运走，使教室与研究所变成了兵营。
    “朝鲜是没有工业的，并且我们也不需要它”一个美国官员这样声明说“我们所需要的一切都要从美国运来。朝鲜的任务——就是开发原料。”
    工业大学就这样断绝了寿命。痛苦的命运又轮到高等女学校身上。在解放之前因“任性与顽强”而被撤职的一位老年女教员静静地讲述着醉醺醺的美国军官怎样闯进了教室，拖走了好看的姑娘；一些女学生就在这种污辱之后自杀了。
    现在教员们正来报告他们开始要恢复那工业大学。在先前美国人的恐怖使全体女学生四散的那女学校里，已经有一部分学生集合起来。并且委派了新教员。
    在教员之后，走进制烟工厂的工人来。尽管企业受到了严重破坏，他们却是市内第一批开始复工的。制烟工人们还给李承烨带来了几盒刚才出货的烟卷。商标还是旧的，但在盒上却有用手画出的自由朝鲜国旗上那样的小星。工人们说他们以自己的力量已经修好了被破坏的车间。
    另一工人代表团——是一个不算大的胶皮鞋企业的制鞋工人。工人李桓君（译音）说他们的主人是个朝鲜富豪，已同美国人逃跑了。他们工人们自己组织起来保护工厂，隐蔽了制成品与贮藏的原料。
    “我们的原料还足够一个月用的，只需要委派一个厂长，并请告诉我们把我们的制成品送那儿去？”李桓君很郑重地说。
    李承烨对他们这种保护国家财产的精神，表示了谢意，并且指点他们，以后应当怎样进行。
    又进来了铁路员工；对他们的欢迎是特别热情的，因为他们日日夜夜的劳动，使一些被破坏的桥梁修复，便利军用列车开向人民军痛击敌人的地方去。
    验路工李全吉（译音）在炎热的六月天，当人民军追击汉城逃敌时，就号召了自己的同志修复了京安区的一座桥梁。这一工程根据专家的判断，如有二千人参加工作，最少也需要两昼夜，但一千五百名司机、铁路技师、火夫、转辙手仅十二小时就完成了这一工程。今天铁路员工来报告，说在汉江地区又修复好一座桥梁。
    跟市长的谈话被电话机的响声打断了。市电信局局长报告说，今天发送信件，电报，与刚出版的报纸的邮差已开始工作了。
    通信员给李承烨拿来了一封便信，他的脸上便闪耀出笑容。
    “纺织联合公司已开始制出第一批布匹”他说，“以前那地方有六百工人工作，现在——八百人，并且他们在一切为了胜利的旗帜下，展开了超额的劳动竞赛。”
    兴高彩烈的生活在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的首都——汉城沸腾着。解放后第四天就在街上开动的电车开行着，汽车行驶着，企业一个跟着一个在恢复中。
    建筑工人也开始工作了；他们修补着马路与人行道。正在建筑两所工人新宿舍与一所大住宅。
    剧院、电影院、商店已开始了工作。平壤的客人——剧院的演员——来到了汉城。
    不管美国飞机怎样的兽性轰炸，汉城人正在顽强地建筑着自己的美丽城市。
    每天在汉城市临时人民委员会的门前，有无数青年的队伍在游行。他们拿着标语与旗帜，其上用朝鲜文写着；“我们去保卫祖国”，“我们志愿上前线”，“我们手里已拿着枪，要参加我们的队伍”。
    在几天的时间里有二千多汉城青年开赴前线。他们向南方走去，向正在为祖国的自由、独立而战斗的英勇的人民军走去。
    他们要去保卫三色的人民旗帜，保卫那飘扬在自由的汉城上空的解放旗帜。
