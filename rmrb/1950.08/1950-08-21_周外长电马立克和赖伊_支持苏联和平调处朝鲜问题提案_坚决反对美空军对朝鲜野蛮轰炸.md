　　Zhou Enlai Cables Malik and Lie
    Supporting the Soviet Proposal for Peaceful Mediation of the Korean Issue
    Firmly Opposing the Savage Bombing of Korea by the US Air Force
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 20th] Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, telegraphed Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Lie on August 20th, denouncing the United States for creating the Korean incident, invading Korea and Taiwan, and attempting to expand the war to achieve its goal of dominating Asia, thereby seriously undermining peace in Asia and the world. Foreign Minister Zhou declared: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports all the proposals put forward by the Soviet representative on August 4th in the United Nations Security Council regarding the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue, and at the same time firmly opposes the savage bombing of Korean cities and peaceful residents by the US Air Force, fully supports the solemn protest put forward by Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-yeong, and demands that the Security Council quickly stop the atrocities of the US military. The text of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram is as follows: Mr. Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, and Mr. Lie, Secretary-General, Lake Success, New York:
    The United States created the Korean incident, launched naval, land, and air forces to directly invade Korea, and used the US Seventh Fleet to invade Taiwan, the territory of our People's Republic of China, attempting to expand the war and achieve its goal of dominating Asia; this has seriously undermined peace in Asia and the world.
    Peace-loving people throughout Asia and the world urgently hope that the United Nations will assume its responsibility for maintaining world peace and security, and quickly and peacefully mediate the Korean issue in an effective way. Korea is China's neighbor, and the Chinese people cannot but be more concerned about the settlement of the Korean issue. The Korean issue must and can be resolved peacefully, but due to the US government's representatives' repeated obstruction and delay of the Security Council's meetings, the Korean issue, which is of concern to the whole world, cannot be reasonably and peacefully resolved. The US government should bear full responsibility for the failure to peacefully resolve the Korean issue.
    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports all the proposals put forward by Mr. Malik, representing the Soviet government, on August 4th in the United Nations Security Council regarding the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue. These proposals are fully in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter and the wishes of the people of Asia and the world.
    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China firmly maintains that: when the Security Council discusses the Korean issue, it is necessary for the representative of the People's Republic of China, with a population of 475 million, to participate, it is necessary to invite representatives of the Korean people to attend and state their opinions, and military action should be stopped in Korea, and foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea; otherwise, it is impossible to reasonably and peacefully resolve the Korean issue.
    The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China firmly opposes the savage bombing of Korean cities and peaceful residents by the US Air Force, fully supports the solemn protest put forward by Mr. Park Heon-yeong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, to the United Nations Security Council on August 5th, and demands that the Security Council immediately take measures to quickly stop the atrocities of the US military that violate international law and the conventions of human morality. This is an irrefutable responsibility of the member states of the Security Council that bear the responsibility of maintaining international peace and security.
    Respectfully submitted, I hope you will take note.
    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
     August 20, 1950, in Beijing

　　周外长电马立克和赖伊
    支持苏联和平调处朝鲜问题提案
    坚决反对美空军对朝鲜野蛮轰炸
    【新华社二十日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于八月二十日致电联合国安全理事会主席马立克及秘书长赖伊，斥责美国制造朝鲜事件，侵略朝鲜和台湾，企图以此扩大战争，并阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题。周外长宣称：中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全支持苏联代表于八月四日在联合国安全理事会所提出的关于和平调处朝鲜问题的全部提案，同时坚决反对美国空军对朝鲜城市及和平居民的野蛮轰炸，完全支持朝鲜政府外交部部长朴宪永提出的严正抗议，并要求安理会迅速制止美军暴行。周恩来外长的电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国安全理事会主席马立克先生及秘书长赖伊先生：
    美国制造朝鲜事件，发动海陆空军直接侵略朝鲜，并以美国第七舰队侵略我中华人民共和国的领土——台湾，企图以此扩大战争，达到其霸占亚洲的目的；这样，就严重地破坏了亚洲及世界的和平。
    全亚洲及全世界爱好和平的人民迫切地希望联合国负起维持世界和平与安全的责任，并以有效的方法迅速和平调处朝鲜问题。朝鲜乃中国邻邦，中国人民不能不更关心朝鲜问题的解决。朝鲜问题是必须而且能够得到和平解决的，但由于美国政府代表百般阻挠和拖延安全理事会的会议，致使为全世界所关心的朝鲜问题不能得到合理的和平解决。美国政府应负有对朝鲜问题不能和平解决的全部责任。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全支持马立克先生代表苏联政府于八月四日在联合国安全理事会所提出关于和平调处朝鲜问题的全部提案，这提案是完全符合联合国宪章精神和亚洲及世界人民愿望的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府坚决主张：安全理事会在讨论朝鲜问题时，必需有四亿七千五百万人口的中华人民共和国的代表参加，必需邀请朝鲜人民代表出席陈述意见，并且在朝鲜应停止军事行动，同时自朝鲜撤退外国军队；否则即不可能合理地和平解决朝鲜问题。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府坚决反对美国空军对朝鲜城市及和平居民的野蛮轰炸，完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交部部长朴宪永先生于八月五日向联合国安全理事会提出的严正抗议，要求安全理事会立即采取措施，迅速制止美军违反国际法与人类道德常规的暴行。这是负担维持国际和平与安全的安全理事会理事国所不容推卸的责任。
    专此奉达，即希查照。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
     一九五○年八月二十日于北京
