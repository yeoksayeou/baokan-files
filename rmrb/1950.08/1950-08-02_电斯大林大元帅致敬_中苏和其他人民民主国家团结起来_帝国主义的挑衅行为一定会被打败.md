Xinhua News Agency, 1st — Beijing various circles celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea demonstration rally telegram to Marshal Stalin: Respected Marshal Stalin:

　　Beijing people from all walks of life celebrating the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a demonstration rally against the United States' aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and hereby extend our highest respect to you—the great leader of the working people of the world.

　　The awakened Chinese people understand that the victory achieved by the Chinese revolution is inseparable from you and the Soviet Union under your leadership’s friendship and assistance to our people. The awakened Chinese people also understand the great role and significance of the close unity, friendship, and mutual assistance between the people of China and the Soviet Union in defending peace in the Far East. No matter how arrogantly American imperialism is destroying peace in the Far East today, we firmly believe that with the strong peace fortress of the Soviet Union in the world, with the unity of the two great powers of China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, and with the awakening of hundreds of millions of people, the threat of war from the imperialist camp can be crushed, and the provocative acts of imperialism can be defeated.

　　The cause of world peace and democracy will surely triumph!

　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the great revolutionary teacher and great leader of the working people of the world!

　　Long live the consolidated unity and eternal friendship of the Chinese and Soviet people!
