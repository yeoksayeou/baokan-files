The CPC Dezhou Prefectural Committee
    Deeply Inspects Work in Various Counties
    The Phenomenon of Many Meetings and Little Inspection is Widespread
    [Our Newspaper] The CPC Shandong Dezhou Prefectural Committee organized five work groups last month, led personally by responsible comrades such as Prefectural Committee Secretary Yuan Chenglong, to inspect work in various counties. The inspection was completed on the 5th of this month. The majority of cadres at the county, district, and township levels are able to work actively and responsibly, and have made certain achievements. However, there are still some problems in their work style. First, counties and districts tend to arrange a lot of work but lack inspection and summary. Some county committees, since the reorganization, have not gone down to understand the situation or inspect the work. When holding meetings to arrange work, they rely on hearsay or guesswork. Therefore, when arranging work, they can only limit themselves to general meeting mobilization and calls to action, and cannot carry out specific organizational work. For example, on how to mobilize and organize the masses for production, they only promote the slogan of "organizing mutual aid production" without specific organizational work. Even after organizing, there is still a lack of specific assistance and improvement work. Therefore, once the busy farming season is over, the mutual aid teams disband. This is the case with the five partnership groups in Caocun District, De County. On the other hand, meetings have also increased as a result, and these meetings do not solve any problems. Some counties and districts hold more than twenty days of meetings in a month, and most of these meetings are to assign tasks and demand numbers, without truly studying the implementation of policies and checking the implementation of policies. This further encourages the purely task-oriented view and coercive command style of district and township cadres. Secondly, due to the above-mentioned work style of leading cadres at all levels, many deviations and errors have occurred in the implementation and implementation of policies, and even policies are promoted indiscriminately, causing dissatisfaction and suspicion among the masses. For example, the propaganda that "land is not allowed to be bought or sold under any circumstances" has led some landlords to launch counterattacks against farmers. According to what is already known, such things have happened in sixteen villages in Caocun District, De County. A landlord has been using lackeys since the year before last to demand three dou of wheat per mu from farmers who have been allocated land, saying, "This is what counts as your land." So far, more than 500 mu of land have been resold. It is currently being planned to deal with it. Furthermore, the coercive command style still exists seriously. For example, in river management and locust catching in Caocun District, De County, district cadres took ropes to gather the masses for meetings to catch locusts. Yang Jianzhang, the financial and economic assistant, even mistakenly said, "This is half mobilization and half coercion!" After checking out the above problems, the prefectural committee first examined that due to its own serious bureaucracy and lack of ideological leadership and regular inspection of cadres, these bad work styles have been able to continue to exist and develop. After checking out these problems, in addition to those that can be solved at any time, the prefectural committee has decided to conduct further inspection and resolution through rectification movement.

　　中共德州地委
    深入各县检查工作
    会议多检查少的现象普遍存在
    【本报讯】中共山东德州地委于上月组织了五个工作组，由地委书记袁成隆等负责同志亲自率领，分赴各县检查工作，本月五日检查完毕。各县、区、乡级干部，大部能够积极负责地工作，并作出了一定的成绩。但是作风上还存在着一些问题。首先是各县、区对工作布置多而缺少检查，缺乏总结。甚至有个别县委，自整编以来，就没有下去了解过情况，检查过工作。在开会布置工作时，道听途说，或者估计推测。因此，在布置工作时，当然只能限于一般的会议动员和号召，无法进行具体的组织工作。例如对如何发动与组织群众生产，只是宣传“组织起来互助生产”的口号，就没有具体的组织工作。即使组织起来后，仍是缺乏具体的帮助与提高工作。所以农忙季节一过，互助组也就随着散伙。德县曹村区五个插伙组就是如此。另一方面，会议也就因此增多，而且这些会议并不解决什么问题。有的县、区一月中要开二十多天会议，而这些会议多半是些布置任务，要数字，并不真正研究执行政策问题和检查政策执行情形。这样更助长了区、乡干部的单纯任务观点和强迫命令作风。其次，由于各级领导干部存在以上的作风，因此执行与贯彻政策上发生了很多偏向和错误，甚至胡乱宣传政策，引起了群众的不满与怀疑。例如宣传：“一律不准买卖土地”，因而有些地主向农民进行反攻。据已经知道的，就有德县曹村区十六个村庄发生了这样的事情，有个地主自前年即开始利用狗腿子向分得土地的农民每亩要三斗小麦，并说：“这才算是你的地了”。至今已倒卖土地五百余亩。现正计划处理中。再是强迫命令作风仍严重存在着，如德县曹村区在治河、捕蝗中，区干部拿着绳子去召集群众开会捕蝗，财经助理员杨建章还错误地说：“这是一半动员，一半强迫！”检查出以上问题后，地委首先检查了由于自己存在着严重的官僚主义，对干部缺乏思想领导与经常的检查工作，以致使这些恶劣的作风能够继续存在与发展。地委检查出这些问题后，除了可以随时解决的以外，并决定通过整风运动，再作进一步的检查与解决。
