*Wenyi Bao* Volume 2, Issue 11 (Total Issue 23) was published on the 25th of this month. Ding Ling's "Striding into a New Era" provides excellent analysis and answers to questions raised by some intellectuals who retain old interests, such as disliking literary works depicting workers, peasants, and soldiers, considering new literary works to be monotonous, crude, and lacking artistry, and demanding more works that portray intellectuals as protagonists. There are two articles discussing the relationship between workers and technical personnel in literary works: a reporter's "Expressing Technical Personnel and True People and Events," and Tao Ping's "On the Relationship Between Workers and Technical Personnel in Works." Ying Qiao's "How Workers Learn to Write" discusses worker creation. Fang Lian's "It is Necessary to Face the Contradictions in Reality" discusses the "Deliberations on a Creative Issue" published in the sixth issue of *Northeast Literature and Art*. This issue selects five essays from the solicitation "Problems Existing in Current Cultural Work Troupes." Starting with this issue, a literary and art mailbox has been added to discuss the problems encountered by literary and art workers in their actual work. This issue's mailbox discusses the issues of "'Vividness' and 'Seriousness'," and "'Truth' and 'Reality'." There is also Hua Junwu's Prague correspondence and "Writing Garden," etc.

　　《文艺报》二卷十一期出版
    《文艺报》二卷十一期（总二十三期）已于本月二十五日出版。丁玲的《跨到新的时代来》，对一些保留着旧兴趣的知识分子提出的问题，如不喜欢读描写工农兵的文艺作品，认为新的文艺作品单调、粗糙、缺乏艺术性，并要求多多描写以知识分子为主人翁的作品，给予了很好的分析和答复。谈作品中工人与技术人员之关系的有记者的“表现技术人员和真人真事”，陶萍的《谈作品中工人与技术人员的关系》等两篇。谈工人创作的有英乔的《工人如何学写作》。方联的《要正视现实中的矛盾》，讨论了发表在东北文艺第六期上的《有关一个创作问题的商榷》。本期选载了《目前文工团存在的问题》征文五篇。自本期起又增辟了文艺信箱，以便讨论文艺工作者在实际工作遇到的问题。在这一期信箱中讨论了“‘生动’与‘严肃’”，“‘真实’与‘现实’”的问题。另有华君武的布拉格通信及“写作园地”等。
