The Liaoxi Provincial State-Operated Badaohao Coal Mine:
    Fatal Accident Due to Flooding

Design flaws and bureaucratic work style were the basic causes of the accident. The Northeast People's Supervisory Committee has disciplined the personnel concerned.

[Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: A water inrush accident occurred in the Liaoxi Provincial State-Operated Badaohao Coal Mine on March 27, drowning 25 workers, resulting in the most serious coal mine accident in Northeast China since liberation. Bereaved families have been quickly compensated. The Northeast People's Supervisory Committee has given the personnel responsible for this accident due punishment and reported it to the State Council of the Central People's Government for approval.

According to several investigations by the Labor Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, it was proven that this accident was entirely caused by the lack of a serious and conscientious sense of responsibility on the part of the mine's leadership. The mine is the only large state-operated mine in Liaoxi Province, having been mined since 1919. It was shut down twice after "August 15th" (end of WWII), and many of the old tunnels had collapsed, accumulating two to four million cubic meters of water. A new shaft was started in 1948, divided into main and secondary tunnels. By July 1949, over 170 meters had been excavated, and work on the main tunnel began in October of the same year. The accident occurred primarily because the administrative leadership and technical personnel of the Badaohao Coal Mine did not adopt an honest attitude towards the design of the new shaft, but instead pretended to understand scientific technology when they did not, resulting in the following errors: First, the design lacked a correct basis, using inaccurate and incomplete test cone diagrams as reliable material without further investigation or correction. Second, excavating below the water level of two to four million cubic meters of accumulated water was inherently dangerous. Third, according to the original design, the tunnel should have been excavated entirely in rock; however, coal was found in the main tunnel on February 22 this year, and a geological fault was discovered on March 25, indicating that the original design was flawed. At this point, the geological strata should have been re-examined and the original design reviewed, but they continued according to the original plan.

This accident also exposed serious bureaucracy in the mine's administrative leadership. The mine's leadership had always held the idea that "production" and "safety" were conflicting concepts. Many cadres believed that "People are bound to die in coal mines. It's much better now than it was under the puppet Manchukuo." On one occasion, when a timber worker discovered a risk of roof collapse and suggested that work should not be carried out, the mine manager fired the worker who raised the issue. During the new shaft's operation, some veteran workers commented, "It's only a matter of time before the rat hole floods," and left one after another. The tunnel chief not only did not pay attention to this, but also thought, "The old workers are being difficult; let them go elsewhere; it's easier to work with new workers, they listen." On March 25, when a fault was discovered in the tunnel, the mine manager was completely unaware. On the morning of the accident, the water in the tunnel was constantly increasing. The worker Geng Rong reported the situation several times, but the party branch secretary and the tunnel chief and others only cared about holding meetings and did not personally or send anyone to check, so they could not take emergency measures, resulting in the unfortunate deaths of 25 workers. (Editor's note: This kind of bad leadership style is essentially indistinguishable from the management of enterprises by bureaucratic capital, and completely fails to consider the safety of workers' lives.)

The Liaoxi Provincial People's Government's Department of Industry should also bear some responsibility for this accident. The department failed to review the erroneous operational design in detail before approving it, nor did it send technical personnel to investigate the situation on the ground before arbitrarily approving it, which is a concrete manifestation of bureaucracy.

To this end, the Northeast Daily published an editorial on July 20, calling on the party and government leading organs of all provinces and cities, and the responsible comrades of all industrial and mining enterprises, to pay attention to the lessons of the Badaohao Coal Mine accident. This is because the leadership's single-minded focus on financial tasks, the irresponsible phenomenon in production leadership, and the lack of attention to labor policies in enterprises, reflected in the accident, also exist to varying degrees in some provinces, cities, and industrial and mining enterprises. If these problems are not quickly overcome, they will inevitably greatly hinder the advancement of the production and construction cause.

　　辽西省营八道壕煤矿
    发生淹毙工人责任事故
    设计错误和官僚主义作风是事故发生的基本原因。东北人民监委会已予有关人员以处分。
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：辽西省营八道壕煤矿在三月二十七日发生透水事故，淹死工人二十五名，造成东北解放后最严重的一次煤矿事故。死难者家属已迅予抚恤。对此次事故应负责之人员，东北人民监察委员会已分别给以应得处分，并呈报中央人民政府政务院批准。
    根据东北人民政府劳动部及东北总工会协同有关方面的几次调查，证明这次事故完全是由于该矿领导上对工作缺乏严肃认真的责任心所造成。该矿是辽西省营唯一的大矿，开采于一九一九年，“八一五”后曾两度停工，旧有巷道坍塌颇多，其中积有二百万至四百万立方米的水。一九四八年开凿新坑，分主坑次坑两个坑道，一九四九年七月已掘进一百七十余米，主坑于同年十月开始动工。事故的发生，首先是由于八道壕煤矿的行政领导与技术人员对于开凿新坑的作业设计，不是采取老老实实的态度，而是自己不懂科学技术，却硬要装懂，因而产生了如下的错误：第一、设计缺乏正确根据，把既不准确又残缺不全的试锥图当成可靠的材料，不再做进一步调查和校正。第二、在二百万至四百万立方米积水的水平线下掘进，本身就存在着严重的危险。第三、按原设计，坑道应一直在岩石中掘进；但在今年二月二十二日主坑见煤，三月二十五日又发现岩石断层，说明原设计有错误。这时即应重新考察地层，审查原设计方案，但他们却依然按照原计划进行。
    从这次事故中，也暴露了该矿行政领导上的严重官僚主义。该矿领导思想上一直存在着“生产”与“保安”对立的观念，许多干部认为“开煤矿那能不死人？现在比伪满时好得多了。”有一次支柱木工发现有冒顶危险，提出不能作业的建议，矿长就把提意见的工人开除了。在新坑作业过程中，曾有些老工人议论：“迟早要灌耗子洞”，纷纷离开。坑长对此不但不加警觉，反而认为“老工人挑皮，让他们到别处去；用新工人好办事，他们听话。”三月二十五日坑中发现断层，矿长竟然完全不知道。发生事故的当天上午，坑内水已不断增多，工人耿荣数次报告情况，党的总支书记和坑长等人只顾开会，竟不亲自或派人去检查，因而不能采取紧急措施，致使二十五名工人不幸牺牲。（编者按：此种恶劣的领导作风实质上和官僚资本管理企业没有区分，完全没有考虑到工人的生命安全。）
    辽西省人民政府工业厅对这一事故也应负一定的责任。该厅在批准该项错误的作业设计之前，未能详细审查，亦未派技术人员前去实地了解情况，即随便批准，这正是官僚主义的具体表现。
    为此，东北日报在七月二十日发表社论，号召各省市的党政领导机关，各工矿企业的负责同志，对于八道壕煤矿事故的教训应予重视。因为该事故所反映出的领导上单纯财政任务观点，生产领导上不负责现象，企业中不注意劳动政策等问题，在有的省市和工矿企业中也或多或少存在。这些问题如不迅速克服，必然大大妨害生产建设事业的前进。
