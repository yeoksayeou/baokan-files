　　Peking University Faculty and Students
    Actively Promote Peace Signature Campaign
    Answering Imperialist Provocations
    [Our Newspaper] The entire faculty and students of Peking University unanimously expressed their boundless indignation at the aggressive act of American planes intruding into our country's northeast airspace and strafing our compatriots. The students believe: "This is an exploratory adventurous act of sabotage and provocation by American imperialism against the Chinese people under the unprecedented power of the world's peace-loving forces. We Chinese students will never allow any imperialism to infringe upon our motherland's airspace. We unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the United States and guarantee to use diligent study, work, and active promotion of the peace signature campaign as a powerful response to this aggressive act by American imperialism." Professor Wen Jia Si said: "The people of the whole country should unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest statement... At the same time, we should not view this incident in isolation. It is closely related to the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Therefore, in addition to protesting this atrocity, we also demand the withdrawal of American troops from Korea and do not allow the United States to prevent us from liberating Taiwan." Professor Fan Hong said: "...American imperialists are mad dogs. If shouting and beating them together is ineffective and the United Nations is unable to catch them, then we have no choice but to counterattack together." Professor Yang Hui said: "Foreign Minister Zhou's protest fully represents the solemn call of the 475 million Chinese people. It tells the imperialists that the Chinese people absolutely will not allow any provocation or atrocity by American imperialist aggressors."

　　北京大学师生
    积极推动和平签名运动
    回答帝国主义者的挑衅
    【本报讯】北京大学全体师生对美机侵入我国东北领空并扫射我同胞的侵略行为一致表示无限的愤慨，同学们认为：“这是美帝在全世界人民拥护和平力量的空前威力下向中国人民试探性的冒险破坏的挑衅行动，我们中国学生绝不容许任何帝国主义侵犯我祖国的领空，我们一致拥护周外长对美国的严重抗议，保证以努力学习、工作和积极推动和平签名运动的实际行动作为对美帝此种侵略行为的一个有力的回答。”闻家泗教授说：“全国人民应一致拥护周外长的抗议声明……同时我们不应当孤立来看这次事件，这和美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜是密切相关的，所以我们除了抗议这次暴行外，还要求撤退朝鲜美军并不许美国阻止我们解放台湾。”樊弘教授说：“……美帝国主义者是一条疯狗，假使齐声喊打都无效而联合国也无力把它捉住，那我们便只有一齐还击了。”杨晦教授说：“周外长的抗议完全代表了中国四万七千五百万人民的严正的呼声，它告诉帝国主义者说：中国人民绝对不允许美帝侵略者的任何挑衅和暴行。”
