The Shouyang County Committee of Shanxi Province Convenes Meeting to Inspect Leadership of Production in the First Half of the Year

[Our Newspaper] In mid-July, the Shouyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province convened an expanded cadre meeting of the county and districts to discuss the instructions of the Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party regarding the direction of rural production, combined with an inspection of the county's leadership of production in the first half of 1950. During the inspection and discussion, it was found that the biggest shortcoming in the county's production leadership was its disconnect from practical work. Since the beginning of spring, in every production activity, the county and district leadership routinely deployed tasks level by level without much consideration for the actual working conditions, which often made it impossible for the villages to accept the instructions from above. Take propaganda and mobilization work as an example. When sowing had already begun, district cadres were still promoting land repair and manure delivery; rural areas were still dominated by individual labor, but tractors were being excessively promoted. Such propaganda naturally would not be welcomed by the masses and fostered the mistaken idea among cadres that production did not need leadership. The biggest problem with going to the countryside to inspect work was also the inability to go deep into the actual work to inspect and discover problems. Instead, they were satisfied with collecting numbers, thus attributing the production achievements of the masses to the leadership. More importantly, this made it impossible to deeply discover problems in the work in order to guide the masses forward. For example, in organizing mutual aid work, the county and district leadership always stayed in circles based on existing experience, without going deep into the actual work to discover new problems and create new experiences. An Sheng Village certainly had achievements in production, but the specific and complete experience of this village could not be summarized. Therefore, the leadership of the county over the districts and the districts over the villages became the issuing of official documents and instructions, urging for forms, figures, and "summarizing experiences." When summarizing spring plowing and sowing, the county party committee office alone issued twenty-one kinds of outlines and forms, and other departments issued more than ten kinds at the same time; and they were given deadlines, causing the districts to be busy all day long collecting statistics and filling out forms. Some then reflected the plans as facts to the higher levels. The phenomenon of writing figures based on estimates also arose. The county asked the districts for figures, and the district cadres only looked for a few village cadres who were active in their work to ask for figures. Fan Wenlian, the party branch secretary of Jiechou Village in the Seventh District, said: "We have to remember some figures, otherwise we won't have anything to say when we open our mouths." Cadres in Daoping Village in the Second District couldn't fill out the forms and cried to the district cadres. Sometimes, when the higher-ups urged them urgently, the lower-level cadres couldn't gather enough data, so they had to make up some figures "out of thin air." At the beginning of spring, Qinquan Village in the Fifth District only organized thirteen mutual aid labor exchange groups, but they reported to the district that they had organized more than forty.

Through this inspection, everyone ideologically clarified the serious harm of this bureaucratic work style that is divorced from actual work. They also proposed preliminary methods to improve the system and overcome the bureaucratic work style by combining it with actual work. (Shu Gang, Sun Sui)

　　山西寿阳县委召开会议
    检查上半年生产领导
    【本报讯】七月中旬，中共山西寿阳县委召开县区扩大干部会议，讨论中共榆次地委关于农村生产方向的指示，结合检查该县一九五○年上半年的生产领导工作。在检查讨论中，发现该县生产领导上的最大缺点是与实际工作脱节。入春以来，在每个生产活动上，县区领导上总是照例逐级往下布置，很少考虑实际工作情况，因而常使村里对上级指示接受不了。比如宣传鼓动工作。播种已经开始了，区干部还在宣传修地送粪；农村中都还是个体劳动，但却过分地宣传拖拉机。这样的宣传自然不会受到群众欢迎，并助长了干部们生产不用领导的错误思想。下乡检查工作的最大毛病，也是不能深入实际工作中去检查与发现问题。而是满足于收集数字，因而也就把群众的生产成绩归功于领导。更重要的，则是由此而无法深入发现工作中的问题，以引导群众前进。比如在组织互助工作中，县区领导上总是停留在现有的经验上打圈子，没有深入到实际工作中去发现新问题，创造新经验。安胜村生产确是有成绩的，但是，这个村的具体的完整的经验却始终总结不出来。因此，县对区、区对村的领导就成了发公文指示，催要表格数字和“总结经验”。总结春耕播种时，仅县委办公室就发下提纲表格二十一种，其他部门也同时发下十余种；并且限期完成，弄得区里终日忙忙碌碌统计数字，填写表格。有些就把计划当事实向上反映。凭估计来写数字的现象也随之产生。县向区要数字，区干部到村也就只找几个工作积极的村干部要数字。七区解愁村中共支书范文联说：“咱可得记住些数字，不然张嘴没什说。”二区道坪村干部填不出表格，愁的向区干部哭起来。有时上边催的紧，下边凑不及，就只有“无中生有”的编些数字。五区芹泉村开春时本只组织起十三个互助变工组，但向区报告时就说成四十多个。
    通过了这次检查，大家从思想上明确了这种脱离实际工作的官僚主义作风的严重危害性。并提出健全制度，结合实际工作克服官僚主义作风的初步办法。（树纲、孙燧）
