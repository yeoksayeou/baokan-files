　　Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: According to current incomplete statistics, the number of peace signatures nationwide has reached 84,850,422, accounting for more than 17.5% of the total national population. This includes 22,195,000 in the Northeast, accounting for 53.2% of the region's population. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has 432,000, accounting for 19.2% of the region's population. Other regions are: North China with 11,998,743, East China with 20,056,535, Northwest with 3,387,348, Southwest with 9,018,849, and Central South with 16,610,602, all of which account for more than 10% of the total population of their respective regions. In addition, the People's Daily in Beijing has received 642,345 signatures from readers across the country.
    Since the China Peace Committee issued a call on August 13th to continue expanding the peace signature campaign, it has been met with enthusiastic responses from people across the country. In many large and medium-sized cities, the vast majority of adults, youth, and children have signed. The number of peace signatures in cities such as Wuhan, Chengdu, Nanchang, Ganzhou, Wuzhou, Changzhou, and Andong has reached more than 90% of the city's population; Shanghai, Chongqing, Qingdao, Jilin, and other cities have reached more than 80% of the city's population. In rural areas, the broad masses of male and female farmers are enthusiastically signing the peace declaration. In Liaodong Province, 3,521,163 farmers have signed, accounting for 66.39% of the province's current number of signatures. Among the more than 700,000 signatures in the three administrative regions of Kashgar, Shache, and Hotan in Xinjiang, the majority are Uyghur farmers. In Zhuyu District of Zhouzhi, Shaanxi, more than 13,000 farmers signed within three days, accounting for 76% of the district's population. According to statistics from nine counties in the Nanzheng City and Xianyang sub-districts of the province, rural working women alone have contributed 160,000 signatures. Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Eastern Sichuan, and Western Sichuan are currently continuing to expand the peace signature campaign into rural areas.
    During this period, the number of peace signatures nationwide has increased by 25,564,243, compared to the 59,286,179 signatures counted when the China Peace Committee issued the notice in mid-August. In just two weeks, the number of peace signatures accounted for more than 40% of the total number of signatures in the previous three months. Facts show that as long as the people of the country continue to work hard and expand the peace signature campaign to the vast rural areas, it is entirely possible to strive to collect 150 to 200 million signatures on the peace declaration nationwide by the end of September.

　　各地热烈响应扩大和平签名运动号召
    全国签名者达八千余万
    还要继续向农村扩展争取两亿人签名
    【新华社二十七日讯】据目前不完全的统计，全国和平签名人数已达八千四百八十五万零四百二十二人，占全国人口总数的百分之十七点五强。计东北二千二百一十九万五千人，占全区人口百分之五十三点二。内蒙古自治区四十三万二千人，占全区人口百分之十九点二。其他地区为：华北一千一百九十九万八千七百四十三人，华东二千零五十六万五千五百三十五人，西北三百三十八万七千三百四十八人，西南九百零一万八千八百四十九人，中南一千六百六十一万零六百零二人，均已占全区人口总数的百分之十以上。此外尚有北京人民日报收到各地读者来信签名的六十四万二千三百四十五人。
    自中国保卫世界和平大会于八月十三日发出继续扩大和平签名运动的号召后，立即得到全国各地人民的热烈响应。在许多大中城市里的成年人、青年及少年绝大多数都签了名。武汉、成都、南昌、赣州、梧州、常州、安东等城市的和平签名人数均已占全市人口百分之九十以上；上海、重庆、青岛、吉林等城市已占全市人口百分之八十以上。在农村中，广大的男女农民群众踊跃地在和平宣言上签名。辽东省已有三百五十二万一千一百六十三个农民签名，占全省现有签名人数的百分之六十六点三九。新疆喀什、莎车、和阗三个行政区签名的七十余万人中，大多数为维吾尔族农民。陕西周至竹峪区三天内即有一万三千余农民签名，占全区人口百分之七十六。据该省南郑市和咸阳分区九个县的统计，仅农村劳动妇女签名的即已有十六万人。广东、广西、湖北、川东、川西等地现正把和平签名运动向农村中继续扩展。
    在这期间，全国和平签名人数较八月中旬中国保卫世界和平大会发出通知时统计的五千九百二十八万六千一百七十九人，增加了二千五百五十六万四千二百四十三人。仅仅两周内，和平签名人数，即为以前三个多月签名总数的百分之四十强。事实说明：只要全国人民继续努力，把和平签名运动扩展到广大农村中去，则争取于九月底在全国范围内征集一万万五千万至两万万人在和平宣言上签名是完全可能的。
