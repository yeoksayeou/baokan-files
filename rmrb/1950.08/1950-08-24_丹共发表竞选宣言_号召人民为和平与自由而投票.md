Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, August 19th: The Danish Communist Party issued an election manifesto regarding the parliamentary elections on September 5th, stating: In this parliamentary election, the victory of the policy of peace means the end of militarization and the frantic arms race, the reduction of taxes, the cessation of rising prices, the consolidation and expansion of the democratic rights of the people, and the strengthening of peace and international cooperation. However, if the war policy continues, it will mean that militarism will continue and intensify; it means that after the recent military appropriation of 350 million kroner, there will be new military appropriations, therefore, Danish youth will serve in the military for many years and sacrifice their lives for the interests of imperialism; new heavy taxes, higher prices and reductions in consumer goods will drain the blood of the Danish people; and it means that Denmark will become a battlefield in a possible atomic war.

The Danish Communist Party appeals to all Danish people who love peace and are willing to fight for a free nation: Let us change the direction of Denmark, ensure the victory of peace, cooperation and rational policies, vote for more Communist Party representatives in the parliament, vote for peace and freedom, and vote for Denmark.

　　丹共发表竞选宣言
    号召人民为和平与自由而投票
    【新华社十九日讯】据塔斯社哥本哈根十七日讯：丹麦共产党就九月五日议会选举发表竞选宣言称：在这次议会选举中，和平政策的胜利，就意味着军国主义化与疯狂的军备竞赛的终止、税收的减低、物价高涨的停止、人民民主权利的巩固与扩大、和平与国际合作的加强。可是，如果让战争政策继续下去，这就意味着军国主义将继续下去并将变本加厉；意味着继最近三亿五千万克罗纳的军事拨款之后，还将有新的军事拨款，因此，丹麦青年将长年服兵役，为帝国主义的利益而牺牲他们的生命；新的苛捐杂税、更高的物价与消费品的削减，将吸干丹麦人民的血；并意味着丹麦将变成可能的原子战争中的一个战场。
    丹麦共产党向一切爱好和平、愿意为一个自由民族而奋斗的丹麦人民呼吁：让我们改变丹麦的方向，保证和平、合作与理性政策的胜利，为议会里有更多的共产党代表而投票，为和平与自由、为丹麦而投票。
