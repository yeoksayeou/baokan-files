    Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 13th (TASS): Malik declared at the Security Council meeting on August 11th: Based on conclusive materials and undeniable facts, the Soviet government has made its assessment of the US government's aggression against the Korean people. The Soviet delegation to the Security Council, acting on instructions from the Soviet government, has, based on various facts and the universally recognized international definition of aggression, stated and proved that the US government has committed a blatant act of aggression against the Korean people, and the US government is the aggressor. The US representative has failed to refute any of these facts.

    As everyone knows, since the beginning, the discussion of the Korean issue in the Security Council has been conducted in accordance with one-sided accounts of the sudden incidents in Korea and the nature of the matter. This one-sided account is entirely provided by the US and Syngman Rhee side, and is entirely based on the one-sided, ulterior motives of the materials provided by the US delegation.

    Citing the so-called report of the United Nations Commission on Korea is untenable. Everyone knows that the committee's report to the United Nations is based entirely on the unsavory, one-sided and fabricated information provided by the American and Syngman Rhee sides.

    The composition of the committee cannot guarantee its objectivity at all. The main report of the committee cited by the US representative was signed by a Kuomintang element named Situ (transliteration). Even the most naive person cannot believe the objectivity of the representatives of the Kuomintang group, because this group serves the US government and receives subsidies from the US government. The US representative vainly attempts to support his accusations against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with these fictitious reports from committees controlled by MacArthur.

    The main report of the Korean Commission mentioned by the US representative is a telegram received by the Secretary-General of the United Nations on June 29, which is said to have been compiled according to the situation on June 24. As long as the two dates are compared, it can be known that the report was written after the failure of Syngman Rhee's army's aggression against North Korea in order to cover up this aggression and its organizers.

    The committee's report insists that the South Korean army was deployed in depth for defense. However, the report submitted by the US government to the Security Council mentions that on the South Korean side, five divisions of troops participated in the battle at the beginning of the war, and the Sixth Division was stationed in the slightly southern area, and also participated in the battle on June 26. The same report also stated that at the beginning of the war, North Korea had three divisions and two brigades - slightly less than five divisions - participating in the battle.

    Therefore, Syngman Rhee's army was not deployed in depth for defense as incorrectly reported in the Korean Commission document, but was concentrated on the border, with the obvious purpose of attacking North Korea.

    The so-called lack of heavy weapons - artillery - of Syngman Rhee's troops is also inconsistent with the facts. In addition to the well-known official US materials that have stated that the US government supplied the South Korean puppet regime with a large number of weapons, the following facts can also be pointed out: According to the communique of the People's Army Command, when the People's Army troops liberated the Ongjin Peninsula from Syngman Rhee's army, they obtained the following spoils of war: 500 light and heavy artillery pieces, more than 2,500 carbines and 140 vehicles.

    The representatives of all member states of the Security Council could see on July 26 an article published in the New York Times before MacArthur implemented the most stringent military inspection. The title of this thesis indicates that the captured weapons helped North Korea. According to the article: Americans say: They are being bombarded by their own artillery captured by North Korea. It is believed that North Korea has captured a large number of weapons. When the South Korean army withdrew one hundred miles from the 38th parallel, it almost abandoned all the equipment it had obtained from the United States, including artillery, motorcycles, and even rifles.

    This is a repeat of the Chinese incident. The Kuomintang bandits were also equipped with American weapons, but when they were defeated by the People's Liberation Army and retreated in disarray, they also abandoned all these weapons.

    In order to conceal the truth, the US representative made direct slander against the Soviet Union, saying that North Korea was constantly supplied with Soviet weapons.

    In my brief statement yesterday, I have answered these slanderous remarks. I have pointed out that the US representative's remarks are all slanderous and do not conform to the facts at all, because the weapons owned by North Korea were sold to it by the Soviet Union when the Soviet army withdrew from Korea.

    It is not only the US representative who has made such slanderous remarks. The famous warmonger Churchill and some of his followers are also spreading the same slander, insisting that the Soviet Union supplied North Korea with jet planes.

    Mr. Churchill's fabrication does not conform to the truth and is fabricated from beginning to end.

    From the facts I have cited above and the materials I will cite, it is very obvious that the source of North Korean artillery is the artillery and weapons that the US government gave to its South Korean puppet Syngman Rhee in such large quantities and so generously.

    The US government report insists that the US Air Force began air combat operations on June 28, which is inconsistent with the actual situation. These actions started long ago. The People's Army Command reported from Pyongyang that US planes had been bombing Korean towns and villages since June 26.

    These are all the facts and conclusions obtained from the official documents submitted to the Security Council in June by the US government and the notorious United Nations Commission on Korea, headed by the Kuomintang, which serves the State Department.

    The words mentioned by the US government report to the committee's note cannot withstand criticism. Here we can see obvious and crude perjury. At first, the US command in Korea and Japan and official representatives provided the committee with false information about the occurrence and development of the Korean incident. Now the US government and its delegation to the Security Council are trying to use the report drafted by the committee based on the US intelligence, which was actually compiled under the command of the US military command, to defend the US accusations against the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Crude perjury is obvious at a glance. A group of member states of the Security Council, without the participation of the two permanent members of the Security Council, the Soviet Union and China, passed illegal resolutions against the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea based on this one-sided, ulterior motive and false information, and now they are trying to bring them up as "Security Council resolutions" and use them as an excuse for the US aggression against Korea.

    Faced with undeniable facts and due to the statements made by representatives of the Syngman Rhee regime and US officials, the entire statement of the US delegation to the Security Council on the development of the Korean incident collapsed. The Soviet government's statement of July 5 (Document 1603) and the statement of the Soviet delegation to the Security Council contained a lot of materials explaining that the Korean incident was caused by the provocative attack by the South Korean authorities' troops on the areas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea north of the 38th parallel. The British representative here tried to use sophistry to prove that Dulles and Museyo could not attack North Korea. It is true that Dulles and Museyo themselves could not do so, but Dulles and Museyo could and did participate in the provocative attack by the 100,000 troops of the Syngman Rhee puppet army on North Korea. This is the fact. The attack itself was the result of a carefully prepared and predetermined plan by the US command and the South Korean puppet Syngman Rhee.

    This is especially proven by Kim Hyo-seok, the former Minister of Interior of Syngman Rhee, who said on July 8: "Everyone knows that MacArthur summoned Syngman Rhee to Japan this spring. There, MacArthur ordered him to put his troops under MacArthur's command during the "Northern Expedition" and train the officers of the so-called "National Defense Army" together with the Japanese army. Syngman Rhee began to implement this order, thinking that as long as he started the Northern Expedition, he could get the support of the US Navy and Air Force, and recruit "volunteers" from Japan, and thought that he would definitely win the war. … On the morning of June 25 of this year, Syngman Rhee issued an order to attack North Korea. The combat plan was originally scheduled to start from Ongjin to capture Haeju, then seize Pyongyang, and then launch an offensive along the entire 38th parallel to support the operations on the eastern front."

    This is the confession of the former Minister of Interior of the Syngman Rhee puppet government.

    The following is the first official statement issued by the Ministry of Interior of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 25 of this year on the occurrence of the Korean incident: "On the morning of June 25, the so-called National Defense Army of the South Korean puppet government launched a full-scale surprise attack on the territory of North Korea along the 38th parallel. The enemy who raided North Korea invaded the territory of North Korea in the areas west of Haeju and in Kimcheon and Cheorwon, one or two kilometers deep north of the 38th parallel.

    The Ministry of Interior of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea ordered the Republic's security forces to repel the enemy invading the territory of North Korea. At present, the Republic's security forces are giving the enemy strong resistance. In the Yangyang area, the Republic's troops have repelled the enemy who invaded the territory of North Korea. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has instructed the Republic's Ministry of Interior to warn the South Korean puppet government authorities that if they do not immediately stop their adventurous operations north of the 38th parallel, the Republic government will take resolute measures to crush the enemy, and the South Korean government will be fully responsible for all the serious consequences caused by this adventurous operation."

    The Security Council did not know these facts. The US delegation tried its best to conceal these facts, and it has never allowed the representatives of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - or as the US representative said: the North Korean authorities - to attend the Security Council, so that they could not state these facts before the Security Council.

    Similarly, Syngman Rhee's repeated aggressive talks against North Korea are also well known. For example, New York Times reporter Sullivan, who visited Korea, wrote on June 26 of this year that all remarks about the war almost came from the leaders of South Korea. On some occasions, Syngman Rhee even blatantly stated that as long as Washington permits, his army would launch an offensive.

    Only a week before the South Korean army launched a provocative attack on the border of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Syngman Rhee delivered a speech at the so-called "National Assembly" in Seoul on June 19, with Dulles in attendance. He said: "If we cannot defend democracy in the Cold War, we will win in the Hot War."

    Dulles replied and assured Syngman Rhee that the United States was willing to give all necessary moral and material support to anti-communist South Korea.

    In this way, Syngman Rhee obtained Washington's consent through Dulles. As a result, the troops of the South Korean authorities launched a provocative attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 25. Then, before the Security Council meeting on June 27, the US government immediately began armed intervention in Korea.

    The US representative's speech yesterday officially admitted and confirmed this. He pointed out that Truman's order to armed intervention in Korea was issued at 12:00 noon on June 27. This proves that the order was issued three hours before the Security Council meeting. It can be seen from the official record that the Security Council meeting was held at 3:00 on this day. Therefore, the US government put the United Nations and the world before a fait accompli, that is, its aggression against the Korean people. This is how the US government illegally and arbitrarily embarked on the road of openly armed intervention in the Korean civil war.

    Everyone knows that the plan for the armed attack was drawn up with the direct participation of General MacArthur.

    Lee Kang-kook, Syngman Rhee's former accomplice and chief political adviser, claimed on July 21: When drafting the plan for the military offensive, MacArthur tried to incite the war before July of this year, because it was said that the Chinese Communist army would launch an offensive against Taiwan in July. The central figures in this offensive were Cai Bingde, Shin Sung-mo and Kim Seok-won, who divided the war zones.

    On the evening of June 24, Syngman Rhee executed MacArthur's order and launched an intra-ethnic civil war in Korea.

    The following facts indicate the extent to which the South Korean army was armed, and how well prepared they were for the armed attack: It can be seen from the report of the House Foreign Affairs Committee of the US Congress that South Korea began extensive preparations in July last year before the US began its aggression against Korea. The United States gave Syngman Rhee $110 million in munitions. According to the Washington reporter of the Associated Press, the above-mentioned report stated that the Syngman Rhee clique had obtained: 100,000 rifles and other guns, more than 2,000 anti-tank rocket launchers and 40,000 rounds of ammunition for rocket launchers, more than 4,900 trucks and other motor vehicles, a large number of 37 mm and 57 mm anti-tank guns and 105 mm howitzers, a large number of 60 to 80 mm mortars and 700,000 rounds of mortar shells, 40,000 Japanese rifles and ammunition for them.

    The United States also gave Syngman Rhee 79 ships, including minesweepers, landing craft and patrol boats. In July 1949 alone, the United States supplied the Syngman Rhee clique with a large amount of war materials, which was enough to arm a large army and equip it fully. On May 19 this year, just one month before the Korean incident, Johnson, the director of the Korean office of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, officially told the House Appropriations Committee of the US Congress that the 100,000 South Korean troops equipped with American equipment and trained by the US military mission had completed their preparations and were ready to launch a war at any time.

    American newspapers have also repeatedly pointed out that the South Korean army is determined to engage in military offensives and has completed military preparations. For example, on June 5, the New York Herald Tribune published a report by its Seoul reporter Herkins, which contained a statement by General Roberts, the head of the US military mission in South Korea. Roberts had more than 500 American military instructors under his command, who were intensively training the South Korean army to prepare for an attack on North Korea. Roberts said: In Korea, the American taxpayers have such an army, which is an excellent watchdog, which protects investment in Korea. It is the most cost-effective force with the smallest expense.

    Of course, this refers to American investment in South Korea.

    Mr. Roberts boasted about how well his American military advisors had trained the South Korean army. He said: The US military advisory group proved how rationally and intensively using 500 war-hardened American officers and soldiers can train 100,000 people to fight for the Americans.

    Roberts also said: Each division of the South Korean army has at least 13 or 4 American officers. They work with South Korean officers and stay with them on the front line, on the 38th parallel, in battle and during rest.

    Regarding this American general's confession - the official military representative of the United States in Korea - we must pay attention to the following points:

    First, the South Korean army was established by the Americans to protect American investment in Korea, because there are no other countries' investments there. This army acts as a watchdog for the American masters in South Korea. American monopoly capital is trying its best to turn South Korea into their colony.

    Second, in early June, 100,000 South Korean troops were in full combat readiness to launch a provocative attack on North Korea.

    Third, in early June this year, General Roberts, the head of the US delegation himself, completely regarded the 38th parallel as a battle line.

    All the above facts completely exposed the so-called unpreparedness of the South Korean army by the US delegation, which is unbelievable, and also showed that the offensive of these troops was prepared long ago, and was launched by the Syngman Rhee clique in accordance with the orders of US officials and with the consent of US officials.

    The confessions of South Korean captured officers also confirmed this. For example, Han So-han (transliteration), the staff officer of the 17th Regiment of the South Korean army who had surrendered to the People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, said: "On June 24 of this year, although it was Saturday, all officers were prohibited from entering the city and ordered to stand by.

    On the night of June 24, the ground forces received secret orders to cross the 38th parallel at dawn on June 25 and start fighting against North Korea.

    After launching the surprise attack, our troops operating in the Ongjin area penetrated into North Korean territory one or two kilometers deep. However, we immediately encountered the resolute resistance of the security forces of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. After crossing two kilometers into North Korean territory, we were forced to retreat under the blows of the security forces. We found that our transportation had been cut off, and the battalions of our regiment could only maintain contact by radio. The security forces inflicted such a powerful blow on us that our troops immediately panicked, even the officers.

    Before the Battle of Ongjin, our 17th Regiment was regarded as the best regiment of the "National Defense" Army. The 17th Regiment was guarding Seoul. This regiment was named the "Double Tigers" team. We were trained according to the idea that it would be very simple to capture North Korea. Our hope lies in this. However, it actually proved that things were quite different."

    All these facts fully and clearly illustrate how the troops of the South Korean puppet regime prepared for a provocative attack in the border areas of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in advance, and how they launched this attack on June 25.

    Domestic conflict, the civil war between the two government camps in Korea thus began. The US government, having provoked this conflict and seeing that the terrorist Syngman Rhee regime was collapsing, openly interfered in Korean affairs. This is an undeniable fact, and the US representative cannot refute it.

    Frankly, whose troops committed acts of aggression and invaded other countries' territories - did the Korean army invade American territory, or did the American army invade Korean territory?

    The whole world knows that it is the American army that has invaded Korean territory, ravaged the rice fields cultivated by Korean farmers and destroyed the crops, rather than the Korean army that has ravaged the cotton and wheat fields of the United States. The whole world knows that it is not Korean planes bombing the American capital Washington and the largest American city New York, but American planes savagely and heavily bombing the most important centers of Korea - Pyongyang, Seoul and many other cities - and Korean residential areas. It is not Korean pilots who strafed American cities and the peaceful residents of residential areas, but American pilots who carried out the orders of war-mongers and aggressors and massacred hundreds of thousands of peaceful Korean residents - women, children and the elderly, destroyed and burned houses, factories, schools, hospitals, cruelly killed patients receiving medical treatment in hospitals, and while doing so, they boasted to the world about how many tons of bombs they had dropped on peaceful Korean cities and villages. We can answer the British representative: Of course, it is neither the herders and farmers of Tennessee nor the workers of Chicago who are carrying out aggression against the Korean people, but the war-mongers and aggressors who put these herders and workers in military uniforms and send them to distant Korea, which they have never heard of, to massacre Koreans and destroy themselves.

    These are all universally known facts, which cannot be covered up no matter how illegal resolutions are cited, precisely because these resolutions cannot explain the bloody aggression of the US government against the Korean people, nor can they find a legitimate excuse for this aggression.

    Mr. Austin wants to talk about the tragic fate of the Korean people here. These words are absolutely hypocritical and false when spoken by the US representative. The American ruling groups are shedding crocodile tears. They care very little about the fate of the Korean people, and they will not be moved by their fate. These businessmen are only interested in business - the mineral deposits and resources of Korea, and the cheap slave labor under the rule of Syngman Rhee, the loyal servant and sycophant of American monopoly capital. Everyone also knows that the American militarists are interested in Korea because they want to use it as a strategic bridgehead on the Asian continent.

    Mr. Austin has taken on a job that he cannot handle. He is trying to copy other people's statements to describe the history of the Korean issue.

    In order to establish the truth, people can remind Mr. Austin that in December 1945, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States and Britain, at the suggestion of the Soviet government and the insistence of Foreign Minister Molotov, passed the famous historical decision on Korea. This decision was subsequently joined by China. This decision fully guaranteed that Korea would be restored as a unified, independent and democratic country.

    The US government and the US in South Korea want to destroy this decision and hinder its implementation. They are reluctant to separate from South Korea and have made up their minds to turn South Korea and even the entire Korea into their colony for the American monopoly capital that covets the rich natural resources of Korea, and to turn the Korean people into their slaves.

    After the US government prevented the establishment of a provisional Korean democratic government, in view of the Korean people's anger at this policy, it relied on the support of the Anglo-American group in the United Nations and illegally submitted the Korean issue to the United Nations in 1947. This action violated and destroyed the wartime agreements and Article 107 of the UN Charter, thus also destroying the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Agreement. Since then, with the help of the Anglo-American group, the US government has forcibly imposed a number of illegal resolutions instigated by it and its South Korean puppets in order to use these so-called "UN resolutions" to cover up the rule of American monopoly capital in Korea.

    The US government and the Anglo-American group did not allow the representatives of North Korea - the representatives of millions of Korean people living north of the 38th parallel - to attend the UN General Assembly meetings. Under the cover of the illegal resolutions that the US government forced the UN General Assembly to pass based on the one-sided information of the US and Syngman Rhee, and trying to turn the entire Korea into their colony, the US government group decided to provoke armed conflict between the South Korean government camp and the North Korean government camp, and sat back and waited for the easy victory promised by the American generals who trained the Syngman Rhee army for this purpose.

    The villainous role in this whole incident was undoubtedly played by General MacArthur, who proclaimed himself God's representative in the Far East, looking for an excuse to prolong his stay in the Far East. He apparently does not plan to return to the United States.

    When the US government's plan for the Syngman Rhee clique failed, and the puppet government itself began to collapse, it rushed to help this group, making the world and the United Nations face the fait accompli of the US government's aggression against the Korean people.

    In short, this is the true history of the development of the Korean incident from the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference in December 1945 to today. These facts are well known, and no evasions or distortions can allow the US representative to cover them up. Is it not clear that the American ruling groups are not concerned about the fate of the Korean people, but about the fate of their investments in Korea, and thus created the so-called "National Defense Army" of the South Korean puppet regime in the form of a "watchdog" to protect their property? This army was named by American General Roberts, and this pseudonym was added to this dog not only to confuse those who were not well informed, but also to confuse the United Nations, because everyone knows that this army has no common interest with the Korean people, and cannot have a common interest. This army and its leader Syngman Rhee were, and still are, slaves employed by American monopolists.

    It can be seen in the history of war that mercenaries have never been characterized by heroic steadfastness or lofty fighting spirit. Although these armies do not have these abilities, they often have the ability to rob, plunder, and inflict atrocities on peaceful people, which is also fully applicable to Syngman Rhee's "National Defense Army."

    It is not surprising that Syngman Rhee carried out MacArthur's order and mobilized his troops to attack the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 25. This army did not and could not withstand the serious test when fighting the real Korean People's Army. The Korean People's Army selflessly serves the Korean people, and they are inspired by their lofty ideal, which is to carry out a sacred struggle for freedom and national independence, and for the establishment of a unified, independent, and democratic Korean country free from all foreign bondage and oppression.

    This is why the People's Army was able not only to repel the enemy's offensive in a few days, but also to launch a counteroffensive and defeat Syngman Rhee's pseudo-National Defense Army. This army acted as a watchdog employed by American masters in South Korea.

    This is the main reason why the People's Army of the Korean people has repeatedly defeated the watchdog of American investment in Korea. This watchdog was raised by American generals under the false sign of the "Korean National Defense Army." The American representatives are trying to convince the members of the Security Council of the opposite.

    However, by comparing the facts, people can clearly see that this myth, which was hastily compiled by the US government and the US military command after the failure of Syngman Rhee's "blitzkrieg" to execute the "Northern Expedition Plan," has been refuted by the American generals and politicians themselves. They established, equipped and trained Syngman Rhee's army in preparation for an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    Is it not clear that whoever believes in this one-sided statement is undoubtedly used by the American aggression against Korea, and in fact becomes a prisoner of the American ruling groups? The American ruling groups are trying to fill everyone's minds with their one-sided and fabricated account of the Korean incident.

    Is it not clear that this nonsense spread by the US delegation in the Security Council at any time and anywhere is prepared for simple-minded people? The purpose of the US delegation is also very clear. Having lost the watchdog in Korea due to the collapse of Syngman Rhee's pseudo-National Defense Army, the American ruling groups are trying to turn the entire United Nations into a weapon to protect the investment and strategic interests of American capitalists in Korea and the Far East, thereby concealing and defending the US government's barbaric aggression against the Korean people.

    It is for these purposes that the US government needs resolutions of the UN Security Council, even illegal resolutions. The illegal nature of these resolutions is well known.

    This matter cannot be denied by the US representative, or even the Secretary-General, because these resolutions do not conform to the UN Charter and grossly violate the UN Charter.

    Also for this purpose, the US government is asking to use the UN flag.

    The US government is trying to use the blue flag of the United Nations to cover up its bloody aggression against the Korean people. The American pilots have dropped thousands of tons of bombs from the American Flying Fortresses on the peace-loving Korean people. These Flying Fortresses are flying the flag of the United Nations, with a branch of olive trees drawn on the flag - the sacred symbol of peace and friendship. Can anything in the world be more disgusting and shameless than this despicable and forced combination of the aggression of the American warmongers who hope to rule the world and the symbol of international peace and friendship?

    This is not only the most blatant violation of the Charter, it is simply a direct mockery of the Charter and the sacred and inviolable goals and tasks of the United Nations.

    What reason, what right, and according to what international law standards do the American ruling groups conduct all these criminal and shameless acts against the peace-loving, hardworking, and talented people of this country, which has been known since ancient times as the "Land of Morning Calm"?

    In any case, the US government and the country's ruling groups have no right to engage in this terrible international crime.

    There is no international legal reason to defend this act of aggression, this international act of robbery, and it is absolutely impossible to have one. According to the widely accepted definition of aggression in international relations, the US government's actions against the Korean people fully and completely conform to this definition and constitute direct acts of aggression, and the US is the attacking party - the aggressor.

    The US government is trying to cover up and defend this aggression with the illegal resolutions of the Security Council on June 25 and 27. The UN Secretary-General and the US government notified the governments of the UN member states of these illegal resolutions under the guise of "Security Council resolutions," which in fact concealed the illegality of these resolutions from the UN member states and world opinion.

    They did not point out that these resolutions were passed in violation of the Charter and without the participation of the two permanent members of the Security Council - the Soviet Union and China.

    At present, in order to remedy these things, the US government is trying to force the Security Council to pass a new illegal resolution condemning the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for so-called "disobedience to UN orders."

    Now it is trying to deceive world opinion and create the impression that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is not fulfilling the legal resolutions of the Security Council. However, the Security Council does not have a legal resolution on the Korean issue. There is no such resolution at all. Therefore, it is impossible to have things like obeying or violating decisions that do not exist at all.

    Therefore, the entire conspiracy of this new proposal by the US delegation is very obvious. Its purpose is to intensify the Korean civil war, to illegally denounce one side in this war, and its main purpose is to hide and defend the further expansion of American aggression against the Korean people.

    Needless to say, the Soviet delegation can only most strongly oppose this proposal, because it conspires to continue and expand the war, and to strengthen American aggression against the Korean people under the false guise of "localizing the conflict."

    The Soviet delegation has been instructed by the Soviet government to submit a proposal on the immediate cessation of the Korean war and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea. The Soviet delegation proposed that the Security Council should listen to the opinions of the representatives of the Korean people - North Korea and South Korea - when discussing proposals for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The Soviet delegation also proposed that the People's Republic of China, which has a direct interest in guaranteeing peace and security in the Far East with the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, should participate in the discussion of this issue. A simple comparison of the above completely opposite two proposals - the Soviet and the American - can prove to the people of the world that the Soviet government wants the Security Council and the United Nations to take the road of peace and peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, while the US government is pushing the Security Council and the United Nations further along the long road of war and strengthening aggression in Korea. The Security Council can make the following choice: whether to resolutely take the road to peace, or, as it has done so far, to crawl into and sink deeper and deeper into the swamp of war that the aggressor, the American ruling group, is forcibly dragging it into.

    The Soviet Union is willing to actively participate in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue through the Security Council, and is willing to use its influence to achieve this lofty goal.

    For the Soviet delegation, the road is clear. It firmly and unconditionally advocates peace and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and urges the Security Council to take this road.

    It firmly opposes the aggressive proposals of the United States and will vote against them.

　　在安理会八月十一日会议上
    苏代表马立克发言全文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十三日电：马立克于八月十一日在安理会会议上宣称：苏联政府根据确凿的材料及无可争辩的事实，已对美国政府侵略朝鲜人民的行动作了它的评价。苏联驻安理会代表团奉苏联政府的训令，根据各项事实与对侵略一词公认的国际定义，已说明并证明美国政府对朝鲜人民犯了粗暴的侵略行为，美国政府是侵略者。美国的代表未能驳倒这些事实的任何一项。
    大家知道：自从一开始以来，安理会中讨论朝鲜问题即一直是依照对朝鲜突发事件以及事情本质的片面之词进行的。这种片面之词完全是由美国及李承晚方面供给的，是完全以美国代表团所提供的片面的、别有用心的材料为根据的。
    引据联合国朝鲜委员会的所谓报告是站不住脚的。大家都知道：这个委员会本身向联合国作的报告也完全是根据那个见不得人的、片面的与捏造的美国及李承晚方面提供的情报。
    这个委员会的组成成份丝毫不能够保证其客观性。美国代表所引用的该委员会主要报告是由一个叫司徒（译音）的国民党分子所签署的。即使是最天真的人也不能够相信国民党集团代表的客观性，因为这个集团是为美国政府服务并领受美国政府的津贴的。美国的代表枉然地以这些由麦克阿瑟操纵的委员会的虚构的报告来支持他对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的指责。
    美国代表所提到的朝鲜委员会的主要报告是联合国秘书处于六月二十九日接到的电报，其中的报告据说是根据六月二十四日的情况编写的。只要把两个日期比较一下，就知道该报告是在李承晚军队侵略北朝鲜失败以后为了掩饰这次侵略及其组织者而编撰出来的。
    委员会的报告中硬说南朝鲜军队是为防御而作纵深部署的。不过，美国政府向安理会提出的报告中则谈到，在南朝鲜方面，有五师军队在战争开始时就参加作战，第六师驻扎在稍南的地区，六月二十六日也参加了作战。同一报告中也说到，在战争开始时，北朝鲜方面有三个师和两个旅——比五师略少——参加作战。
    所以李承晚的军队并不是像朝鲜委员会文件中所不正确地报告的那样为了防御而作纵深的部署，而是集中在边界上，其目的显然是进攻北朝鲜。
    所谓李承晚部队缺少重武器——大炮——也与事实不符。除了人所共知的美国官方材料已经说明了美国政府供给南朝鲜傀儡政权大量武器之外，还可指出下面的事实：根据人民军司令部的公报，在自李承晚军队手中解放瓮津半岛时，人民军部队获得了下列战利品：五百门轻重炮，二千五百多支卡宾枪和一百四十辆汽车。
    安理会所有理事国的代表们在七月二十六日可以看到在麦克阿瑟还没有实行最严格的军事检查以前纽约时报刊登的一篇论文。这篇论文的标题指出卤获的武器帮助了北朝鲜。据该文称：美国人说：他们正受到他们自己被北朝鲜卤获的大炮的轰击。人们认为：北朝鲜曾卤获大量武器。南朝鲜军队自三八线后撤一百英里时差不多放弃了所有从美国获得的装备，包括大炮，摩托车，甚至步枪。
    这是中国事件的重演。国民党匪徒也曾装配有美国的武器，但当遭受人民解放军的打击以致溃不成军、节节退却时，他们也放弃了所有这些武器。
    为了要蒙蔽真相，美国代表对苏联使用直接的诽谤，说北朝鲜不断得到苏联武器的供应。
    在昨天的简短声明中，我已经答复了这些诽谤言论。我已指出美国代表的言论全属诽谤谰言，与事实丝毫不符，因为北朝鲜拥有的武器是由苏联在苏军撤出朝鲜时卖给它的。
    发出这种诽谤言论的不仅是美国代表。著名的战争贩子邱吉尔和他的一些追随者也同样的在散布这种诽谤，硬说苏联以喷气式飞机供给北朝鲜。
    邱吉尔先生这种捏造与真相并不符合，从头到尾都是捏造出来的。
    从上面我所引证的事实以及我还要引证的材料来看，十分显然北朝鲜大炮的来历是美国政府如此大量，如此慷慨送给其南朝鲜傀儡李承晚的大炮与武器。
    美国政府报告中硬说美国空军于六月二十八日开始空军的战斗行动，这并不符合实际情况。这些行动是老早就开始了的。人民军司令部自平壤报告，美国飞机自六月二十六日起就一直在轰炸朝鲜的市镇与村庄。
    这些都是从美国政府与为国务院服务而以国民党人为首的声名狼藉的联合国朝鲜委员会于六月间提交安理会的正式文件中所获得的事实与结论。
    美国政府报告中提到这个委员会照会的话都是经不住批评的。这里我们可以看到显而易见的粗劣的伪证。起初美国驻朝鲜与日本的指挥部与官方代表给这个委员会提供了关于朝鲜事件的发生与发展的虚假情报，现在美国政府及其在安理会的代表团又企图以这个委员会根据美国情报所草就的报告，实际上是在美国军事指挥部的指挥下编撰的报告来为美国对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的指责辩护。粗劣的伪证是一目了然的。安理会一批理事国在苏联与中国两个常任理事国未参加的情况下，根据这单方面的别有用心的虚假情报通过了反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的非法决议，现在又企图把它们提出来充当“安理会的决议”，利用它们作为美国侵略朝鲜的口实。
    面对着无可争辩的事实而且由于李承晚政权的代表与美国官员们所作的声明，安理会美国代表团所提出的关于朝鲜事件发展的整个说法全部垮台了。苏联政府七月五日的声明（第一六○三号文件）以及安理会苏联代表团的声明包含了许多材料，说明朝鲜事件是南朝鲜当局的军队寻衅进攻三八线以北朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的地区所引起的。英国代表在这里企图以诡辩来证明杜勒斯与缪锡俄都不能进攻北朝鲜。不错，杜勒斯与缪锡俄本人不能够这么做，然而杜勒斯与缪锡俄能够而且确已参加李承晚傀儡军队十万人寻衅进攻北朝鲜。这就是事实。这次进攻的本身是美国指挥部与南朝鲜傀儡李承晚周密准备的预定计划的结果。
    这特别由李承晚的前内政部长金孝锡所证明，他在七月八日说：“大家都知道，麦克阿瑟曾在今春召李承晚到日本。在那里，麦克阿瑟命令他在“北伐”期间把他的军队归麦克阿瑟指挥，并把所谓“国防军”的军官和日本军队在一起训练。李承晚开始执行这命令，满心以为他只要开始北伐，便可以获得美国海空军的支持，便可以从日本招得“志愿军”，并以为他绝对能取得战争的胜利。……在本年六月二十五日的清晨，李承晚发出了进攻北朝鲜的命令。作战计划原定要从瓮津出发攻取海州，接着攫取平壤，然后沿着整个三八线发动攻势，以支持东线的作战。”
    这就是李承晚傀儡政府前内政部长的供词。
    以下为朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内政部在本年六月二十五日就朝鲜事件的发生所发表的第一个官方声明：“在六月二十五日清晨，南朝鲜傀儡政府的所谓国防军沿着三八线，对北朝鲜领土发动了全线的突袭。突袭北朝鲜的敌人在海州以西的地区及金川、铁原两地侵入北朝鲜的领土，在三八线以北纵深一、二公里。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内政部命令共和国保安部队击退侵犯北朝鲜领土的敌人。目前，共和国保安部队正予敌人以坚强的抵抗。在襄阳地区，共和国部队已击退了侵犯北朝鲜领土的敌人。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府已训示共和国内政部警告南朝鲜傀儡政府当局，假如他们不立即停止他们在三八线以北的冒险作战，共和国政府将采取坚决的措施，粉碎敌人，南朝鲜政府将要对这种冒险作战所引起的一切严重后果，负完全的责任。”
    安全理事会并不知道这些事实。美国代表团极力掩盖这些事实，它以前和现在都不允许朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府——或者如美国代表所说：北朝鲜当局——的代表出席安理会，以免他们能在安理会之前申述这些事实。
    同样地，李承晚屡次发表的针对着北朝鲜的侵略性谈话，也是众所周知的。举例来说，访问朝鲜的纽约时报记者苏利凡曾在本年六月二十六日写道，所有关于战争的言论，几乎都是出诸南朝鲜领袖之口。在某种场合，李承晚甚至露骨地表示，只要华盛顿许可，他的军队就会发动进攻。
    仅在南朝鲜军对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的边境发动挑衅性的进攻前一周，李承晚于六月十九日在汉城的所谓“国民议会”演说，杜勒斯也在座。他说：“如果我们不能够在冷战中保卫民主的话，我们将在热战中得到胜利。”
    杜勒斯回答时向李承晚保证，美国愿给反共的南朝鲜一切必要的道义上与物质上的支持。
    这样，李承晚便经由杜勒斯得到了华盛顿的同意。于是，南朝鲜当局的军队便在六月二十五日向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动了挑衅性的进攻。接着在六月二十七日的安理会会议还没有召开以前，美国政府就立刻开始了对朝鲜的武装干涉。
    美国代表昨天的演说已正式承认和证实了这一点。他指出，杜鲁门武装干涉朝鲜的命令是在六月二十七日中午即日间十二点钟颁布的。这就证明了这道命令是在安理会召开会议以前三小时发表的，从正式记录上可以看到，安理会会议是在这天三点钟举行的。因此，美国政府就把联合国与全世界置于既成事实之前，即它对朝鲜人民的侵略的事实之前。美国政府非法而专横地走上公开对朝鲜内战的武装干涉的道路，情形就是这样。
    谁也知道，武装进攻的计划是在麦克阿瑟将军的直接参加下制订出来的。
    李承晚以前的同谋者和主任政治顾问文学凤七月二十一日曾声称：当起草军事进攻的计划时，麦克阿瑟试图在今年七月以前煽起战争，因为据说中国共产党军队将在七月间对台湾发动攻势。这次进攻的中心人物是蔡秉德，申性模和金锡源，他们瓜分了作战的地带。
    六月二十四晚上，李承晚执行了麦克阿瑟的命令，在朝鲜发动了同族相争的内战。
    下面的事实指明了南朝鲜军队武装到了怎样的程度，和他们为武装进攻准备到了怎样的程度：从美国国会众院外交委员会的报告中可以看出，在美国开始侵略朝鲜以前南朝鲜在去年七月就开始了广泛的准备工作。美国给了李承晚一亿一千万美元的军火。根据合众社华盛顿记者的消息，上述报告称李承晚集团已获得：十万支来福枪和其他枪械，两千多只反坦克火箭炮和供火箭炮用的四万发弹药，四千九百多辆卡车和其他摩托车辆，大量的三十七公厘和五十七公厘反坦克炮和一百零五公厘的榴弹炮，大量的六十到八十公厘的迫击炮和供迫击炮用的七十万发炮弹，四万支日本来福枪和供它们用的子弹。
    美国也给了李承晚七十九只船，其中包括扫雷艇、登陆艇和巡逻艇。仅在一九四九年七月，美国就供应了李承晚集团大批战争物资，这些物资足以武装一支庞大的军队，并使之装备齐全。今年五月十九日，就在朝鲜事件发生之前一月，美国经合总署朝鲜处处长琼逊曾正式告诉美国国会众院拨款委员会说：美式配备并受美国军事使团训练的十万南朝鲜军队已完成他们的准备，随时都可以发动战争。
    美国报纸也曾经屡次指出南朝鲜军队决心从事军事进攻，并且已经完成了军事准备。例如六月五日纽约先驱论坛报便刊登了该报驻汉城记者赫金斯的报道，这篇报道载有美国驻南朝鲜军事使团团长罗伯茨将军的声明。罗伯茨手下有五百多个美国军事教官，紧张地在训练着南朝鲜军队，准备进攻北朝鲜。罗伯茨说：在朝鲜，美国的纳税人有着这样的一支军队，这支军队是出色的看家狗，它保护对朝鲜的投资，它是一支收效最大开销最小的部队。
    当然，这是指美国在南朝鲜的投资。
    罗伯茨先生夸耀他的美国军事顾问把南朝鲜军队训练得多么好。他说：美国军事顾问团证明了怎样合理而紧张地使用五百名久经战争锻炼的美国官兵，就能训练十万能为美国人作战的人。
    罗伯茨又说：每一师南朝鲜军至少有十三、四个美国军官。他们与南朝鲜军官一起工作，一同在前线，在三八线，在打仗与休息的时候，他们也和南朝鲜军官形影不离。
    对于这个美国将领——美国驻朝鲜的正式军事代表所作的供认，我们必须注意下列数点：
    第一，南朝鲜军队是美国人建立起来，用以保护美国在朝鲜的投资的，因为那里没有其他国家的投资；这支军队充当在南朝鲜的美国主子们的看家狗，美国垄断资本竭力想把南朝鲜变为他们的殖民地。
    第二，在六月初，十万南朝鲜军队为着向北朝鲜发动挑衅的进攻，处在完全的战斗准备状态中。
    第三，在今年六月初，美国代表团团长罗伯茨将军本人说到三八线时，完全是把它当作一条战线。
    所有上面的事实完全揭穿了美国代表团所谓的南朝鲜军无准备是难以相信的，也表明了这些军队的进攻是早就准备妥当了的，是李承晚集团遵照美国官员的命令，取得美国官员的同意而发动的。
    南朝鲜被俘军官的供词也证实了这一点。例如，已向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军部队投降的南朝鲜军第十七团参谋官韩索汉（译音）便说：“今年六月二十四日那天，虽然是星期六，可是禁止所有的军官进城，并令他们待命。
    六月二十四日夜，地面部队接奉密令于六月二十五日破晓越过三八线，开始对北朝鲜作战。
    在发动突袭后，我们这支在瓮津地区活动的部队便深入北朝鲜领土纵深一、二公里。可是我们立即碰到了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保安部队的坚决抵抗。在越过北朝鲜领土二公里之后，我们便在保安部队的打击下被迫后退。我们发觉我们的交通已被切断，我们这一团各营之间只能以无线电维持联系。保安部队使我们遭到那样强大的打击，我们的部队立即惊慌失措，即使是军官也是如此。
    在瓮津之役以前，我们第十七团被视为“国防”军最优良的一团。十七团是警卫汉城的。这一团是以“双虎”队为名的。我们是依照夺取北朝鲜很简单这种思想来训练的。我们的希望就在于此。可是，实际上证明事情却与此迥乎不同。”
    所有这些事实都充分明白地说明了：南朝鲜傀儡政权的军队事前怎样在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的边境地区准备了寻衅进攻，又怎样在六月二十五日发动了这种进攻。
    国内冲突、朝鲜两个政府阵营之间的内战便这样开始了。美国政府既挑起了这个冲突而又看到恐怖主义的李承晚政权正在土崩瓦解，于是公开干涉朝鲜事务。这就是无可争辩的事实，而且美国代表也无法予以反驳。
    老实讲，谁的军队犯了侵略行为而且侵入他国领土——是朝鲜军侵入了美国领土呢，还是美国军队侵入了朝鲜领土呢？
    全世界都知道：是美国军队侵入朝鲜领土、蹂躏朝鲜农民辛苦耕种的稻田并且毁坏了庄稼，而不是朝鲜军队蹂躏美国的棉田和麦地。全世界都知道：不是朝鲜飞机轰炸美国首都华盛顿和美国最大的城市纽约，而是美国飞机野蛮地猛烈轰炸朝鲜最重要的中心——平壤、汉城及许多其他城市——和朝鲜的居民区。不是朝鲜的飞行员扫射美国城市及居民区的和平居民，而是执行战争贩子与侵略者命令的美国飞行员屠杀成百成千的朝鲜和平居民——妇女、儿童与老人，摧毁和焚烧住宅、工厂、学校、医院，惨杀在医院中就医的病人，他们一边干一边还向世界吹嘘对朝鲜和平城市与乡村丢了多少吨的炸弹。我们可以答复英国代表：当然，既不是田纳西的牧人和农夫，也不是支加哥的工人而是战争贩子和侵略者对朝鲜人民进行侵略，这些战争贩子和侵略者使这些牧人与工人穿上军装，便把他们送到他们前所未闻的遥远的朝鲜去，屠杀朝鲜人，毁灭他们自己。
    这些都是大家普遍知道的事实，无论怎样引用非法的决议也是不能掩盖的，正因为这些决议既不能解释美国政府对朝鲜人民的血腥侵略，也不能为这种侵略找得正当的借口。
    奥斯汀先生在这里想谈到朝鲜人民的悲惨命运。这些话从美国代表口中说出来是绝对假意和虚伪的。美国的统治集团是在猫哭耗子。他们很少关心朝鲜人民的命运，也不会为他们的命运而感动。他们这些生意人感到兴趣的只有生意——朝鲜的矿藏和富源，在李承晚这位美国垄断资本的忠顺奴仆和谄谀者的殖民地傀儡政权统治之下的贱价奴隶劳动力。大家也都知道，美国军国主义者对朝鲜感到兴趣的，是想利用它当作亚洲大陆上的战略桥头阵地。
    奥斯汀先生担负起了他能力所不及的工作，他企图抄袭别人的说法来叙述朝鲜问题的历史。
    为了要确立真理，人们可以提醒奥斯汀先生，在一九四五年十二月，苏联、美国和英国外长在苏联政府的建议和外长莫洛托夫的坚持之下，通过了有名的关于朝鲜的历史性决定。这决定随后也得到中国的参加。这决定充分地保证了朝鲜要恢复为统一、独立和民主的国家。
    美国政府和在南朝鲜的美国都要破坏这个决定，并阻碍其实行，他们舍不得和南朝鲜分离，并且立下了决心，要替垂涎丰富的朝鲜天然资源的美国垄断资本，把南朝鲜以至整个朝鲜变为他们的殖民地，把朝鲜人民变为他们的奴隶。
    美国政府在阻挠成立临时朝鲜民主政府以后，因鉴于朝鲜人民对这个政策的愤怒，遂依靠英美集团在联合国中的支持，非法将朝鲜问题于一九四七年提交予联合国；这种行动是违反并破坏战时的各项协定及联合国宪章第一○七条的，因此也破坏了莫斯科三国外长协定。自那时起，美国政府靠了美英集团的帮助，强施了好些由它及其南朝鲜傀儡们所唆使的非法决议，以便用这些所谓“联合国决议”来掩护美国垄断资本在朝鲜的统治。
    美国政府及英美集团不让北朝鲜的代表——住在三八线以北的千百万朝鲜人民的代表——出席联合国大会会议。以美国政府强使联合国大会根据美国与李承晚单方面的情报而通过的非法决议为掩护，并且力图把全朝鲜沦为他们的殖民地，美国政府集团决定在南朝鲜政府阵营与北朝鲜政府阵营之间挑拨武装冲突，屈指坐待为了这个目的而训练李承晚军队的美国将军们所一口承诺的易如反掌的胜利。
    这整个事件中的恶毒角色无疑地是由麦克阿瑟将军来扮演的，他自封为上帝在远东的代表，寻找借口延长他在远东的居留期限。显然不打算回到美国去。
    当美国政府对李承晚集团的打算失败了，而且傀儡政府本身也开始垮台的时候，它便急急援助这个集团，使全世界与联合国面对美国政府侵略朝鲜人民的既成事实。
    简短说来，这便是自从一九四五年十二月莫斯科三外长会议以来直至今日朝鲜事件发展的真正历史。这些事实尽人皆知，任何遁辞与曲解都不能使美国代表来掩蔽它们。难道还不可以清清楚楚地看出美国的统治集团并不是关怀朝鲜人民的命运，而是关怀他们在朝鲜的投资的命运，并从而制造了南朝鲜傀儡政权的所谓“国防军”这种形式的“看家狗”来保卫他们的财产吗？这支军队是由美国将军罗伯茨命名的，把这个假名加在这条狗身上不但是为了要迷惑那些消息不够灵通的人民，而且也要迷惑联合国，因为大家知道，这支军队是与朝鲜人民的利益毫无共同之处，而且不可能有共同之处。这支军队及其头子李承晚以前是，以后仍然是美国垄断资本家所雇用的奴仆。
    在战争的历史中可以看到：雇佣军从来没有英勇刚毅或崇高的战斗精神的特点。这些军队虽然没有这些本领，但却屡屡具有抢劫、掠夺，以及对和平的人民施加暴行的本领，也完全适用于李承晚的“国防军”。
    李承晚履行麦克阿瑟的命令，在六月二十五日调动军队进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，这种军队在与真正的朝鲜人民军作战时没有经得起，而且也不可能经得起严重的考验是不足为奇的。朝鲜人民军忘我地服务于朝鲜人民，他们受到他们的崇高理想的鼓舞，这个理想就是：为了自由与民族的独立，为了建立一个不受一切外国束缚与压迫的统一、独立、民主的朝鲜国而进行神圣的斗争。
    这就是为什么人民军在数天以内不仅能够击退向它扑来的敌方进攻，并且能够转入反攻，击溃了李承晚的伪国防军。这支军队充当了在南朝鲜的美国主子所雇用的看家狗的角色。
    这就是朝鲜人民的人民军屡次战胜朝鲜美国投资的看家狗的主要原因所在。这只看家狗是美国将军们在“朝鲜国防军”的假招牌下豢养起来的。美国的代表却企图使安理会的理事国相信与这相反的事情。
    然而把事实比较一下，人们会很明显的看出：在李承晚“闪电式”地执行“北伐计划”失败之后，美国政府及美国军事统帅部仓促地编纂的这个神话，已被美国将领们及政客们自己所驳倒；他们建立、装备并训练了李承晚的军队，准备进攻朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    谁要是相信了这种片面之词，谁就毫无疑问地为美国侵略朝鲜所利用；事实上成了美国统治集团的俘虏，这难道还不清楚吗？美国统治集团企图把他们片面的、捏造的关于朝鲜事件的说法填到一切人的脑子里去。
    美国代表团在安理会中这样随时随地都在散布的这种无稽之谈是为头脑简单的人预备的，这难道还不清楚吗？美国代表团的目的同样也很清楚。由于李承晚的伪国防军的崩溃而丧失了在朝鲜的看家狗以后，美国统治集团正在设法把整个联合国变成保护美国资本家在朝鲜和远东的投资和战略利益的武器，从而掩饰并辩护美国政府对朝鲜人民的野蛮侵略。
    正是为了这种种目的，美国政府才需要联合国安全理事会的决议案，甚至非法的决议案。这些决议案的非法性质是人所共知的。
    这件事是美国代表、甚至秘书长都是不能否认的，因为这些决议案是不符合联合国的宪章，而且粗暴地破坏了联合国宪章的。
    同时也为了这种目的，美国政府又要求使用联合国的旗帜。
    美国政府企图用联合国的蔚蓝色的旗帜来掩饰对朝鲜人民的血腥的侵略。美国的飞行员已从美国的飞行堡垒中向爱好和平的朝鲜人民投下几千吨炸弹，这些飞行堡垒打着联合国的旗帜，旗帜上面画有橄榄树的树枝——和平与友谊的神圣的标志。世界上还能有什么东西比这种把希望统治世界的美国好战分子的侵略和国际间的和平与友谊的标志卑鄙地、强迫地混在一起更令人作呕、更无耻呢？
    这不仅是最粗鲁地侵犯了宪章，这简直是对于宪章、对于联合国神圣不可侵犯的目标和任务的直接嘲弄。
    美国统治集团对于这个自古以来即以“清晨静谧之土”见称的国家的爱好和平的、勤劳的和多才的人民进行这一切犯罪的无耻行为，是以什么理由、什么权利、根据什么国际法标准呢。
    无论如何，美国政府以及该国的统治集团是没有权利来从事这种可怖的国际罪行的。
    对于这种侵略行为，这种国际的强盗行为，没有任何国际的合法的理由可资辩护，而且也绝不可能有。根据在国际关系中所广泛接受的对于侵略的定义，美国政府对朝鲜人民的行为是充分而完全合乎这一定义，并构成直接的侵略行为，美国为进攻的一方——侵略者。
    美国政府企图以安理会六月二十五日及二十七日的非法决议来掩盖和辩解这种侵略。联合国秘书长和美国政府在“安理会决议”的外衣下把这些非法决议通知联合国各会员国政府，这事实上就是在联合国会员国和世界舆论面前把这些决议的非法性遮掩起来。
    他们并未指出：这些决议是违反宪章，在没有安理会两个常任理事国——苏联和中国参加的情形下通过的。
    目前美国政府为了补救这些事情，企图强使安理会通过一个新的非法决议，谴责朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府所谓的“不服从联合国命令”。
    现在又在企图欺骗全世界的舆论，制造一种朝鲜民主主义人民共和国不履行安理会合法决议的印象。但是，安理会并没有关于朝鲜问题的合法决议。这种决议根本就没有。因此，不可能有服从或违反根本不存在的决定的事情。
    因此，美国代表团这个新提案的全部阴谋非常明显。它的目的在于使朝鲜内战剧烈化，在于非法斥责这个战争中的一方，而它的主要目的就是隐藏及辩护进一步扩大美国对朝鲜人民的侵略。
    不消说，苏联代表团只有最强有力地反对这种建议，因它阴谋继续及扩大战争，并在“使冲突局部化”的假话下加强美国对朝鲜人民的侵略。
    苏联代表团方面已奉苏联政府训令，提出关于立即停止朝鲜战争及自朝鲜撤退外国军队的建议。苏联代表团建议安理会在讨论和平解决朝鲜问题的建议时，应听取朝鲜人民——北朝鲜及南朝鲜——的代表陈述意见。苏联代表团并建议讨论这个问题时要有与朝鲜问题的和平解决保证远东的和平与安全有着直接利害关系的中华人民共和国参加。把上述完全相反的两建议——苏联的和美国的——作一简单对比，即可向全世界人民证明：苏联政府要安理会和联合国走上和平及和平解决朝鲜问题的道路，而美国政府则推动安理会和联合国沿着战争及加强在朝鲜的侵略的漫长道路更前进一步。安理会可作如下抉择：是坚决采取走向和平的道路，或者还是像迄今为止那样，爬入并越来越深地陷入侵略者即美国统治集团正把它强行拉入的战争沼泽中去。
    苏联愿意通过安理会积极参加和平解决朝鲜问题，并愿运用它的影响以达到这个崇高的目的。
    对苏联代表团来说，道路是明显的，它坚决及无条件地主张和平及和平解决朝鲜问题，并敦促安理会走这条道路。
    它坚决反对美国的侵略性提案，并将投票反对它这些提案。
