　　Rationally Utilize Labor Force and Safeguard Soldiers' Health
    Railway Engineering Corps Implements Labor Safety Regulations
    Overexertion Detrimental to Health Must Be Stopped
    [Reported by this Newspaper] The Railway Engineering Corps is formally implementing the "Draft Labor Safety Regulations" to rationally utilize the labor force, avoid accidental losses in work, and safeguard the health of soldiers. According to the varying degrees of labor intensity, the regulations divide all work on-site and in factories into three categories: light work, general work, and heavy work. It is clearly stipulated that the pure working time for light work shall not exceed ten hours per day; general work shall not exceed nine hours; and heavy work shall not exceed eight hours. To accommodate the varying physical strengths of soldiers, the regulations stipulate that soldiers be classified into three grades according to their physique, and the amount of labor they can undertake is determined according to their different physical strengths. In addition, the regulations also clearly stipulate rules for rest, overtime, and labor protection under various circumstances. Those who violate the rules will be subject to disciplinary action or even legal sanctions, depending on the severity of the violation.
    In the past few years of rush repair work, the soldiers of the Railway Engineering Corps have demonstrated remarkable labor enthusiasm and initiative, creating great achievements in the glorious tasks of seizing time, restoring transportation, and supporting the war. The nationwide railway's ability to successfully complete the rush repair task last year is inseparable from the efforts of the Railway Engineering Corps soldiers.
    However, the tendency to simply emphasize the increase of individual physical workload without paying attention to the rational organization and utilization of the labor force is prevalent in the Railway Engineering Corps. As a result, the phenomenon of reckless work through overexertion seriously affects the health of the soldiers. According to a December statistic from the Fourth Detachment Hospital last year, thirty-seven out of eighty-seven convalescents were comrades who had been credited with meritorious service. The famous "Big Iron Ox," "Second Iron Ox," "Third Iron Ox," and "Calf" of the Second Detachment were all young, active, and strong, capable of carrying two or three sleepers and carrying six baskets of earth, but they all fell ill due to excessive labor.
    For this reason, the Health Department of the Engineering Corps, based on actual on-site investigations and physiological research, drafted the "Draft Labor Safety Regulations," which was revised and approved by the Engineering Corps work conference in March and officially put into trial implementation in May.

　　合理使用劳动力保障战士健康
    铁道兵团推行劳动安全条例
    超体力劳动影响健康必须停止
    【本报讯】铁道兵团正式推行《劳动安全条例草案》，以求合理使用劳动力，避免工作中意外损失，保障战士们的健康。该条例根据各种劳动程度的不同，将现场和工厂所有工作划分为：轻工作、一般工作和重工作三种；明确规定：轻工作每天纯工作时间不得超过十小时；一般工作不得超过九小时；重工作不得超过八小时。为照顾战士们身体强弱的不同，该条例规定按战士体格划分为三等，按不同体力规定了所能担当的劳动量。此外，该条例并明确的规定了休息、加班及各种情况下的劳动保护规则；对违犯规则的当事人，则将分别轻重予以处分甚至法律制裁。
    铁道兵团的战士们在几年来的抢修工作中，表现了惊人的劳动热情和积极性，在争取时间，恢复交通，支援战争的光荣任务中创造了伟大的功绩。去年全国铁路所以能胜利完成抢修任务，和铁道兵团战士们的努力是分不开的。
    但单纯强调个人体力作业量的增加，不注意合理组织与使用劳动力的偏向，在铁道兵团是普遍存在的，因而超体力劳动的蛮干现象，严重的影响到战士们的健康。据四支医院去年十二月份统计，八十七个休养员里有三十七个是立过功的同志；二支队有名的“大铁牛”、“二铁牛”、“三铁牛”和“牛犊子”都是年青、积极、有力，能扛枕木二、三根，挑土六筐的能手，也都由于过分劳动累病了。
    为此，兵团卫生处根据现场实际调查，和生理学的研究，起草了《劳动安全条例草案》，经三月间兵团工作会议修改通过，于五月份即已开始正式试行。（铁道兵团卫生处长郭光）
