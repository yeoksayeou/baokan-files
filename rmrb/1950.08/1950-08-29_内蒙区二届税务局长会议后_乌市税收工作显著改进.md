　　Following the Second Inland Mongolia Tax Bureau Directors Conference

　　Ulanhot's Tax Work Significantly Improved

　　[Our newspaper Ulanhot news] The Inland Mongolia Tax Administration, based on the spirit of the Second National Tax Conference of the Central Government, convened a joint conference of all Inland Mongolia Second Tax Bureau Directors on July 8th. Since the conference, the work of assessing and collecting business tax and income tax for the second quarter in Ulanhot has seen significant improvements.

　　The conference was held just as the assessment of business tax and income tax for the second quarter of the region was beginning. Therefore, the main task of the conference was to implement the spirit of "handling affairs according to law, calculating taxes according to rates" as decided by the Second National Tax Conference into practical work, and to combine this with checking and summarizing past work, correcting the shortcomings and working styles of general leaders and cadres. Therefore, in this collection work in Ulanhot, a cautious and responsible attitude was adopted from the beginning. During tax assessment, each stage was checked and understood once, and it was coordinated with a meeting attended by representatives of industry and commerce. This first corrected the bias of "assessment without democracy" that had existed in the past. In the past, some cadres, when assessing taxes, rigidly divided the tasks equally among each industrial and commercial household. This kind of assessment, which was like apportionment, caused uneven burdens. The reaction of merchants and the people was very negative. This time, the tax rate was emphasized as the task, which dispelled the ideological concerns of merchants and enabled the assessment work to be completed smoothly. After the city-wide declaration and assessment were completed, the tax bureau, in conjunction with relevant departments and representatives of industry and commerce, jointly understood and reviewed the assessment results. According to the survey materials and the opinions of the representatives, it was found that the turnover of more than 40 households was not accurate, and it was decided to conduct another reasonable reconsideration until it was fair and reasonable.

　　For the assessment of income tax, the general industrial and commercial households had more concerns. Therefore, the city tax bureau held another income tax collection meeting with the participation of representatives of industry and commerce. Based on the business conditions and capital turnover of various industries in the first half of the year, the net profit rates of various industries were jointly determined: the lowest was 6.5 percent for the cloth industry, and the highest was 28 percent for the medicine, photography, and engraving industries. After the tax bills were issued, there was generally not much objection to the amount of tax. Only some households reflected that the goods could not be sold temporarily; some reflected: "Small capital and large expenses, all the money earned is spent." There were also individual households that earned a lot of money, but squandered it on extravagant eating and drinking. These households requested that the payment deadline be extended, or that more taxes be collected in the next period. To this end, the tax bureau invited representatives of industry and commerce to discuss together. For individual households that were genuinely difficult and had legitimate reasons, and were unanimously recognized by their peers, the tax amount was reduced by a few percent depending on the circumstances, and then supplemented at the end of the year.

　　In general, the city bureau has grasped more materials than in the past, especially after strengthening the management of shipping invoices since April, the understanding of the business conditions of various industries is also clearer. Therefore, the results of the assessment are also more reliable and closer to the truth. However, this is only the beginning of work achievements, and there are still many shortcomings and loopholes. For example, in the assessment, the role of some group leaders was great, but some lagged behind the group members, forming mutual cover-ups. In addition, the net profit rate was not obtained by scientific calculation and implemented after full preparation. On the other hand, the method of net profit rate conversion was also adopted for business owners who adopted the method of tax calculation by checking accounts, which lost the significance of rewarding the establishment of accounts. Finally, the work of publicity and explanation should be further strengthened in the future to gradually improve the work.

　　内蒙区二届税务局长会议后
    乌市税收工作显著改进
    【本报乌兰浩特讯】内蒙区税务管理局根据中央二届全国税务会议精神，在七月八日召开了全内蒙区二届税务局长联席会议。会后，乌兰浩特市估征第二季度营业税及所得税工作，已有显著的改进。
    会议的召开正当该区第二季营业税及所得税估征开始进行的时候，所以会议的主要任务是将二届全国税务会议决定的“依法办事、依率计税”的精神，贯彻到实际工作中去，并结合检查与总结过去工作，纠正一般领导与干部的缺点和作风。因而在乌兰浩特市此次的征收工作中，一开始即采取了慎重负责的态度。评税时，每一个阶段均进行一次检查与了解，并配合一次有工商业代表参加的会议。这样就首先纠正了一向“评议而不民主”的偏向。过去有些干部评税时，硬将任务平摊在每个工商业户头上，这种形同摊派的评议，造成了畸轻畸重的现象。商民的反映非常不好。这次强调了税率就是任务，解除了商民的思想顾虑，因而使评议工作顺利地完成。在全市申报评议结束后，税局又结合各有关部门及工商业代表，共同对评议结果作了了解和审查，根据调查材料和代表们的意见，发现有四十余户的营业额不确实，就决定再作一次合理的复议，直到公平合理为止。
    对所得税的估征，一般工商业户顾虑较多，因而市税局又召开了有工商业代表参加的所得税征收会议，根据上半年各行业营业情况及资金的周转，共同决定了各行业的纯益率：最低为布业百分之六点五，最高为医药、照像、刻字等业百分之二十八。税票开出后，一般对税额轻重没有多少意见，仅有些户反映货一时卖不出；有些反映：“本小开支大，赚了钱都开销了。”也有个别户赚钱很多，但是大吃大喝都浪费了。这些户都要求缴款期限延长，或下期再多征。为此，税局又召请各工商代表共同讨论，对个别真正困难有正当理由，而且为同业一致公认的户，便酌量情况决定将税额减少几成，到年终再为补缴。
    总的说来，由于市局比过去较多的掌握了材料，特别是从四月份起加强对发货票的管理后，对各行业营业情况的了解也较清楚。因而评议的结果也比较的可靠和接近真实。但这只是工作成绩的开端，缺点和漏洞还很多。如在评议中，有的小组长作用大，但有的便落后于组员，形成互相包庇。另外，对纯益率的求得，并未作科学的细算，和充分地准备后公布施行。另一方面，对采用查账计税的业户，也采取了纯益率换算办法，失掉了奖励建立账户的意义。最后是宣传解释工作，今后尚应进一步加强，使工作逐步提高。
