　　Capital Air Defense Forces and Artillery
    Maintain High Alertness
    Determined to Eliminate Invaders
    [This newspaper's report] The incident of American aircraft intruding into our country's northeastern airspace has greatly angered the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the capital. Everyone unanimously believes that this intolerable and brutal crime must be severely punished; and resolutely stated that they will use powerful armed forces as the backing for the people of the whole country to lodge a serious protest against the United States. As soon as the news reached a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit guarding the capital's air defense, discussions were immediately launched in various companies, and meetings of heroes and model workers were held one after another. Gunner Zhang Jiaqin of the Second Company said: "The provocation of American aircraft in the Northeast is an expansion of the aggressive acts of the American aggressors in Korea and our territory of Taiwan." Therefore, he, like all the soldiers, believes that "Foreign Minister Zhou's immediate demand for severe punishment of the American murderers, compensation for our country's losses, and the immediate withdrawal of all American troops invading Korea is completely correct and completely in line with the will of the entire Chinese people."
    The soldiers are determined to maintain a high degree of national defense vigilance to support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest. Anti-aircraft gunner Gao Yinda said: "We must wipe the cannons bright and shiny, so that when the enemy dares to invade our sacred airspace again, every cannon will exert its maximum power. How many enemy planes there are, we will eliminate that many!" The second squad leader of the Fourth Company made a strong guarantee on behalf of the entire squad. He said: "We guarantee that when enemy activity is discovered, we will enter the position within two minutes and be ready for firing!" The soldiers of a certain artillery unit asked the reporter to write a letter on their behalf to the people of the whole country to swear: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army, which defeated the Kuomintang bandits supported by American imperialism, wholeheartedly supports Foreign Minister Zhou's protest against the United States and his demands to the UN Security Council, and absolutely will not allow American aggressors to run rampant in our country's territory, airspace, and territorial waters! If the American aggressors do not stop this provocation, they will suffer the same fate as the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits!"

　　首都防空部队和炮兵
    保持高度警惕性
    决心消灭侵犯者
    【本报讯】美国飞机侵入我国东北领空的事件，大大地激怒了中国人民解放军驻防首都的指战员们。大家一致认为：这种使人难以容忍的、残暴的罪行，必须得到严厉制裁；并坚决表示：要以强大武装力量，作为全国人民向美国提出严重抗议的后盾。消息刚刚传到警卫首都空防的高射炮某部，各个连队就立刻展开讨论，纷纷召开英模座谈会。二连的炮手张家勤说：“美国飞机在东北的挑衅，是美国侵略者在朝鲜和我国领土台湾的侵略行为的扩大。”因此他同所有的战士们同样认为：“周外长立即提出严惩美国凶手，赔偿我国损失，并要美国立即撤退全部侵朝部队，是完全应该的，完全符合全中国人民的意志。”
    战士们决心以保持高度的国防警惕性，来支持周外长的抗议。高射炮手高印达说：“我们一定要把炮擦得亮亮的，在敌人敢于再度侵犯我们神圣的领空时，使每门炮都发挥它最大的威力。有几架敌机就消灭它几架！”四连的二班长更替全班提出了有力的保证，他说：“我们保证在发现敌情时，用两分钟进入阵地并作好射击的准备工作！”炮兵某部战士们要求记者代他们写信向全国人民宣誓：“战胜了美帝支持下的国民党匪帮的中国人民解放军，衷心的拥护周外长对美国的抗议和对联合国安理会的要求，绝对不允许美国侵略者在我国领土领空领海横行！如果，美国侵略者不停止这种挑衅，他们就会得到像日寇和国民党匪帮一样的下场！”
