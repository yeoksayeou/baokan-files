　　Steady Progress in South China's Foreign Trade
    By our Special Correspondent Gu Weijin
    Overcoming Difficulties, Moving from Import Surplus to Balance
    The initial stage of South China's foreign trade work (between November and December of last year) faced significant difficulties. At that time, South China had been liberated not long before, transportation had not fully recovered, Hong Kong dollars flooded the market, prices fluctuated continuously, merchants did not understand the People's Government's foreign trade policy, and due to the urgent need for imported goods in various regions, coupled with the effort to expel Hong Kong dollars, the Foreign Trade Administration adopted a policy of encouraging private merchants to import using their own foreign exchange. As a result, imports exceeded exports significantly, leading to a large import surplus. According to Guangzhou's statistics, in November, the approved export value was 16,097 Hong Kong dollars, while the approved import value was 8,272,904 Hong Kong dollars, with an export-to-import ratio of 1:514. In December, the approved export value was 2,008,793 Hong Kong dollars, and the approved import value was 53,570,904 Hong Kong dollars, with an export-to-import ratio of 1:26.6. Furthermore, at that time, cadres lacked a clear understanding of foreign trade policies, leading to passive management. For example, the criteria for imports were set too broadly, approving anything that was not a luxury item. There was a lack of investigation and research into market needs, resulting in a degree of blindness in imports.
    The New Democratic foreign trade policy is to manage imports, promote exports, and focus on promoting exports. Based on this spirit, the South China Foreign Trade Administration actively promoted exports from January to March of this year. It convened symposiums for exporters, clearly explaining the foreign trade management regulations and foreign exchange management regulations to merchants, assuring them that foreign exchange settlement would not be disadvantageous. The People's Bank of China started foreign exchange trading at reasonable rates, ensuring exporters' profits. Furthermore, as transportation gradually recovered (such as the opening of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway), commodity exchange became more active, and the Renminbi began to dominate the market, this created many favorable conditions for exports. In addition, attention was paid to managing imports, such as understanding local production and sales situations and clearly stipulating which goods could be imported and which could not. Thus, from January to March, exports increased monthly while imports relatively decreased, shifting from an import surplus towards a balance. In terms of exports, using the approved export value in December as a base of 100, January saw a 14-fold increase in export value compared to December, February saw a more than 9-fold increase, and March saw a more than 15-fold increase. In terms of imports, also using the approved import value in December as a base of 100, January saw a 99.61% decrease in import value compared to December, February saw a 68.13% decrease, and March saw a 62.02% decrease. Under these circumstances, the import-export ratios were: imports to exports in January were slightly less than 2:1, imports to exports in February were 2:1, and imports to exports in March were 1:1, achieving a balance.
    Implementing Policies, Moving from Balance to Overall Export Surplus
    Foreign trade in the second quarter of this year was conducted under the continued implementation of the policy of managing imports and promoting exports. As business developed, cadres gradually clarified their understanding of the policies for managing and protecting foreign trade, initially recognizing that management and protection meant mastering international market prices, opening up and restoring foreign markets, uniting public and private forces to organize exports, finding ways to export goods that were difficult to sell, and protecting and encouraging private merchants to operate profitably. This understanding became a driving force for promoting work. First, there was progress in implementing the policy of promoting exports. For example, the People's Bank of China set the exchange rate for export foreign exchange higher than the black market rate, so exporters could not only make money on the goods themselves but also profit from the exchange settlement. The preliminary tendency to overcome excessively high exchange rates, allowing exporters to not have to subsidize exchange. Various regions relaxed price assessments for ordinary or difficult-to-export goods, initially overcoming the tendency of high pricing policies. Active efforts were made to simplify export procedures. For example, for time-sensitive export goods such as live pigs, vegetables, fruits, and eggs, efforts were made to approve exports on the same day, reducing exporters' costs and unexpected losses. These all encouraged exporters to actively engage in exports. Second, flexible management was used to wage planned struggles with imperialism in the international market. Hong Kong speculators attempted to depress the price of China's main export product, tung oil. The Foreign Trade Administration organized private merchants to sign a pact, stipulating that tung oil would arrive in Hong Kong collectively and be sold in a planned manner, avoiding merchants selling separately at low prices. In this way, tung oil sales took the initiative in the Hong Kong market, speculators could not manipulate prices, and the price of tung oil gradually recovered. Third, in order to protect the legitimate operations of private merchants, some regional foreign trade organizations began to unite public and private forces to combat smuggling. In Shiqi, the Foreign Trade Administration united legitimate merchants to plan and crack down on private smugglers evading foreign exchange settlements. Fourth, cadres at all levels began to correct bureaucratic and administrative styles of work, listen to private merchants' reflections, and jointly study and resolve difficulties, enhancing private merchants' confidence in operations.
    Over the past three months, the Foreign Trade Administration has made these efforts, taking into account both public and private interests. In addition, the national economy and finance have been unified, prices have normalized, export profits have been guaranteed, and in accordance with central instructions, imports of certain goods with sufficient domestic production, such as wheat, flour, and paper, have been restricted. As a result, South China's import and export trade in the second quarter has seen an unprecedented new situation, that is, from balance to a comprehensive export surplus. The import and export ratios over the past three months show that in April, exports were more than three times imports, meaning exports were more than three times higher than imports; in May, exports were slightly less than five times imports, meaning exports were slightly less than five times higher than imports; in June, exports were slightly less than three times imports, meaning exports were slightly less than three times higher than imports. The decrease in the export surplus in June was due to it not being the peak export season, which is a normal phenomenon.
    Operational Direction Facing Rural Areas, Facing Industry
    Over the past six months, the policy of managing imports and promoting exports has not only been implemented in the number of imports and exports, but also in the types of goods imported and exported. Exported goods have begun to face rural areas, serving rural construction; imported goods have begun to face industry, serving industrial construction. Taking the import and export goods in May as an example: on the export side, agricultural products and rural specialties from South China, which could not be exported in the past, can now be continuously exported. For example, plant products ranked first in exports, accounting for 44.65% of exports, animal products ranked second, accounting for 28.65% of exports, textile fibers ranked third, accounting for 12.43% of exports, and bamboo and wood fuels ranked fourth, accounting for 8.41% of exports. In terms of individual goods, live pigs ranked first in exports, tung oil ranked second, and eggs ranked third. On the import side, high-end consumer goods that were imported in large quantities in the past have gradually disappeared, replaced by goods for industrial construction. For example, oils, fats, waxes, and gums ranked first in imports, accounting for more than 37% of imports, chemical products and dyes ranked second, accounting for more than 16% of imports, food, beverages, and herbs ranked third, accounting for more than 14% of imports, and cotton and its products ranked fourth, accounting for more than 11% of imports. In terms of individual goods, lubricating oil ranked first in imports, cloth ranked second, and Western medicine ranked third. Comparing the import categories in May with those in April further demonstrates the increasing service of import operations for industrial construction. For example, chemical products and dyes rose from fourth place in imports in April to second place in imports in May, while food, beverages, and herbs fell from second place in imports in April to third place in imports in May. By June, due to the adjustment of public-private relations and the gradual opening of factories, chemical products and dyes further rose from second place in imports in May to first place in imports in June.
    Taking into Account Public and Private Interests, Strengthening Public-Private Unity
    Over the past six months, South China's foreign trade work has provided many assistance to private import and export merchants, and private businesses have done more business than public businesses. This can be seen from the proportion of public and private import and export from January to May: on the export side, private businesses accounted for 72.33%, and public businesses accounted for 22.5%, with private businesses accounting for 48.83% more than public businesses; on the import side, public businesses accounted for 77.4%, and private businesses accounted for 22.6%, with public businesses accounting for 54.8% more than private businesses (if the import of cotton, grain, fuel, and other goods necessary to stabilize prices are not included in the public business, then private businesses also import more). The import and export plan for the second half of this year has decided to further increase the proportion of private import and export. Therefore, the market for private businesses is very broad, and they can do business with confidence.
    In order to continue implementing the policy of taking into account both public and private interests and to further promote foreign trade, the South China Foreign Trade Administration is adjusting public-private relations. The South China preparatory meeting for the National Import and Export Trade Conference held on June 19 was conducted in this spirit. At the meeting, the government called on the more than 130 representatives of industry and commerce, experts, and government representatives present to offer opinions on the existing shortcomings and difficulties in import and export trade and solutions to those difficulties. Representatives of industry and commerce believed that there were some shortcomings in the management of foreign trade: (1) The valuation work in various parts of South China is not uniform, the valuation of some export goods is too high, and adjustments are not timely. The management pace of the South China region is also inconsistent with that of other regions. (2) The planning of exports is not thorough enough, making export goods intermittently available on the international market, with prices fluctuating, affecting normal transactions. The management of imports sometimes also lacks planning. For example, when banning the import of goods that are sufficiently produced domestically, merchants were not notified in advance, and the ban was implemented immediately after it was announced, so merchants did not have time to transfer goods from other places, resulting in shortages in the market, affecting production and supply and demand. (3) The acquisition of local products lacks professional knowledge. A state-owned trading company acquired duck feathers, but did not understand the goods, acquired them at a high price, transported them to Hong Kong, and sold them at a loss. This caused harm to both the public and private sectors: on the one hand, high-priced acquisitions affected the acquisition of private merchants; on the other hand, public funds were lost due to sales at a loss. (4) The scope of operations does not sufficiently take care of private merchants; the scope of acquisition by local product companies is too broad. (5) Commodity inspection is not serious enough; some commodities are still considered unqualified after inspection in Hong Kong. In the future, formalistic inspections must be eliminated, and merchants must be effectively assisted in pointing out areas where commodities need to be improved in order to maintain the credibility of commodities in the international market. (6) Relevant import and export trade agencies such as banks, customs, tax bureaus, and transportation systems should further simplify procedures and unify steps; otherwise, the circulation process of imported goods will be affected, costs will increase, and production and sales will be hindered. At this meeting, representatives of industry and commerce conducted self-criticism, pointing out that there is often a phenomenon of "private without public" among private merchants, and even speculation and opportunism. They believed that this practice of only considering private interests and disregarding national policies was wrong. At the same time, they put forward many active suggestions for improving import and export trade, such as establishing packaging and processing factories, establishing public warehouses in important ports, organizing exhibitions, export demonstration farms, foreign trade research associations, publishing Chinese and English publications related to foreign trade, establishing international business information networks, and holding various professional foreign trade conferences. In total, representatives of industry and commerce put forward more than 100 criticisms, suggestions, and other opinions. After listening to these opinions, the South China Foreign Trade Administration first conducted self-examination of the criticisms raised by the representatives of industry and commerce, pointing out the reasons for these shortcomings, which was that the implementation of the policy of taking into account both public and private interests was not sufficient. Secondly, it decided to conduct research on the many suggestions put forward by the representatives of industry and commerce, and gradually implement those that were feasible according to the urgency of the matter. Thirdly, it explained the problem of the scope of operations not sufficiently taking care of private merchants, explaining that the acquisition of local product companies was not all-inclusive. This can be seen from the fact that the company's acquisition plan from June to December of this year only accounted for 7.8% of the total output of local products in Guangdong Province in terms of funds. It also used figures to show that private businesses actually did more import and export trade than public businesses from January to May of this year, thereby dispelling the one-sided view of private merchants on the scope of operations. Finally, the South China Foreign Trade Administration, based on the opinions of both the public and private sectors, proposed the main ways to overcome current biases: it is necessary to further unite and help each other between the public and private sectors based on the principle of overall planning and consideration, the public sector should strengthen its leadership over the private sector, and the private sector should be universally organized; the private sector should also eliminate factions, strengthen unity, organize joint ventures, and overcome its own weaknesses to improve operation management and reduce production costs.
    This meeting fully demonstrated the spirit of further mutual understanding, mutual learning, and unity between the public and private sectors. In the future, by implementing this spirit, South China's foreign trade will surely be rapidly promoted.

　　稳步前进的华南对外贸易
    本报特派记者  古维进
    克服困难，从入超走到平衡
    华南对外贸易工作的初期（去年十一月至十二月间），是有很大困难的。这时华南解放不久，交通尚未完全恢复，港币泛滥市场，物价不断波动，商人不明了人民政府的对外贸易政策，加上当时各地区需要进口物资殷切，以及配合驱逐港币，对外贸易管理局便采取鼓励私商自备外汇进口的方针，因此，物资进口多出口少，大量入超。据广州区统计，十一月批准出口金额一六、○九七元（港币，下同），批准进口金额八、二七二、九○四元，出口与进口之比为一比五一四；十二月批准出口金额二、○○八、七九三元，批准进口金额五三、五七○、九○四元，出口与进口之比为一比二六·六。此外，当时干部对对外贸易的政策思想不够明确，管理陷于被动。比如进口的尺度定的太宽，只要不是奢侈品都批准进口，对市场需要缺乏调查研究，致进口多少带有盲目性。
    新民主主义的对外贸易政策是管理进口，推广出口，重点放在推广出口。基于这种精神，华南对外贸易管理局自今年一月至三月份，便积极推广出口。召开出口商座谈会，向商人明确解释对外贸易管理办法和外汇管理办法，使商人明了结汇不会吃亏。人民银行开始外汇交易所的工作，以合理的价格挂牌，使商人的出口利润得到保证。加以当时交通逐渐恢复（如粤汉铁路通车），物资交流较为活跃，人民币开始占领市场，便造成出口的许多有利条件。另外，开始注意管理进口，如掌握各地产销情况，明确规定那些东西可以进口，那些东西不能进口。这样，一月至三月份出现出口逐月增加，进口相对减少，由入超走向平衡的局面。出口方面，如以十二月批准出口金额为基数一百，一月比十二月增加出口金额十四倍，二月比十二月增加九倍强，三月比十二月增加十五倍强。进口方面，亦以十二月批准进口金额为基数一百，一月比十二月减少进口金额百分之九九·六一，二月比十二月减少百分之六八·一三，三月比十二月减少百分之六二·○二。在这种情形之下，出进口的比例是：一月进口与出口之比为二比一弱，二月进口与出口之比为二比一，三月进口与出口之比为一比一即达到平衡。
    贯彻政策，从平衡走向全面出超
    今年第二季的对外贸易，是在继续贯彻管理进口，推广出口的政策之下进行的。随着业务日益开展，干部对于管理与保护对外贸易的政策思想逐渐明确，初步认识管理与保护就是掌握国际市价、开辟与恢复国外市场、团结公私力量组织输出、对于困难外销的货品设法使其出口以及保护与鼓励私商经营，使其有利可图等问题。对于这些问题的认识，就成为推动工作的一种动力。首先对于执行推广输出的政策有了进步。如人民银行对出口外汇牌价定的高于黑市，出口商不仅在货物方面可以赚钱，在结汇本身亦有利润。对于结汇牌价初步克服过高的偏向，出口商可以不必贴汇。各地区对于普通的或困难的出口货，审价方面放宽一些，初步克服高价政策的偏向。积极设法简化出口手续。如对于有时间性的出口货如生猪、蔬菜、生果、蛋品等，尽可能做到当天批准出口，减少出口商的费用和意外损失。这些，都鼓舞了出口商积极经营出口。其次，机动管理，有计划的和帝国主义在国际市场斗争。香港投机商人曾企图压低我国主要出口产品桐油的价格，对外贸易管理局便组织私商，订立公约，规定桐油集体到达香港有计划的出售，避免商人分别低价出售。如此桐油的售价在香港市场取得主动地位，投机商人无法操纵价格，桐油的价格逐步回升。第三，为了保护正当私商的经营，有些地区对外贸易机构开始团结公私力量与走私作斗争。在石歧，对外贸易管理局团结正当商人有计划的破获私枭逃避结汇。第四，各级干部开始纠正工作中的事务主义与官僚主义作风，听取私商反映，与私商共同研究解决困难的办法，提高私商的经营信心。
    三个月来，对外贸易管理局在主观上进行这一切公私兼顾的努力，加上在客观上全国财经统一，金融物价正常，出口利润有了保证，以及根据中央指示，限制若干在本国已有足够生产的物品如小麦、面粉、纸张等进口，这样华南第二季的出进口贸易，出现一个前所未有的新局面，即由平衡走向全面出超。从三个月来的出进口比例可以看出：四月份出口与进口为三比一强，即出口为进口的三倍强；五月份出口与进口为五比一弱，即出口为进口的五倍弱，六月份出口与进口为三比一弱，即出口为进口的三倍弱。六月份出超减少，是由于出口不是旺季，这是正常的表现。
    经营的方向面向农村，面向工业
    半年来，管理进口，推广出口的政策不仅贯彻在出进口的数目上，也贯彻在出进口的货品上。出口的货品开始面向农村，为农村建设服务；进口的货品开始面向工业，为工业建设服务。据五月份出进口的货品为例：出口方面，过去各地区未能输出的农产品及华南区的农村特产品，现在都可以不断的输出。如植物产品类为出口的第一位，占出口的百分之四四·六五，动物产品类为出口的第二位，占出口的百分之二八·六五，纺织纤维类为出口的第三位，占出口的百分之一二·四三，竹木燃料类为出口的第四位，占出口的百分之八·四一。以个别货品来说，生猪占出口的第一位，桐油占第二位，蛋品占第三位。进口方面，过去大量输入的高级消费品已经逐渐绝迹，代替它的是工业建设的货品。如油脂胶蜡类为进口的第一位，占进口的百分之三七以上，化学产品类及染料类为第二位，占进口百分之一六以上，食品饮料草药类为第三位，占进口的百分之一四以上，棉及其制品类为第四位，占进口的百分之一一以上。以个别货品来说，滑物油占进口的第一位，布占第二位，西药占第三位。如以五月份的进口货类和四月份的进口货类比较，更能看出经营进口的进一步为工业建设服务。如化学产品类及染料类，由四月份进口的第四位跃居为五月份进口的第二位，食品饮料草药类由四月份进口的第二位降为五月份进口的第三位。到了六月份，由于公私关系的调整，工厂逐渐开工，化学产品类及染料类更由五月份进口的第二位跃居为六月份进口的第一位。
    公私兼顾，加强公私团结
    半年来，华南对外贸易工作上对私营进出口商进行许多帮助，私营做的生意比公营还多，这从一月至五月份公私营出进口比例可以看出来：出口方面，私营占百分之七二·三三，公营占百分之二二·五，私营比公营多百分之四八·八三；进口方面，公营占百分之七七·四，私营占百分之二二·六，公营比私营多百分之五四·八（如果公营不包括稳定物价所必需的棉粮燃料等进口，也是私营进口的多）。今年下半年的出进口计划，已决定更进一步的提高私营的出进口比重。因此，私营经营的市场非常广阔，可以放心做生意。
    为继续贯彻公私兼顾政策，把对外贸易推进一步，华南对外贸易管理局正在进行公私关系的调整。六月十九日召开全国出进口贸易会议华南预备会议，就是在这种精神下进行的。会上，政府号召到会的一百三十余名工商界代表、专家、政府代表对于目前出进口贸易存在的缺点、困难及解决困难的办法提出意见。工商界代表认为对外贸易的管理上存在着一些缺点：（一）华南各地的估价工作不统一，部分出口货的估价过高，调整亦不及时。华南区与其他地区的管理步调也不一致。（二）出口的计划性不够周密，使出口货在国际市场上时有时无，价格忽高忽低，影响到正常交易。管理进口有时也缺乏计划性。如禁止国内有足够生产的货品进口时，事前没有通知商人，公布后立即实行，商人来不及往外地调货，以致市场发生缺货现象，影响生产与供需。（三）收购土产缺乏业务知识。一家国营贸易公司收购鸭毛，不懂货色，高价收购，运到香港，赔本出售。这样造成公私两不利：一方面由于高价收购，影响私商的收购；一方面由于赔本出售，公家受到损失。（四）经营范围照顾私商不够，土产公司收购的范围太广。（五）商品检验，不够认真，有些商品检验后到了香港仍被认为不合格。今后要去掉形式主义的检验，切实协助商人指出商品需要改良的地方，以维持商品在国际市场的信用。（六）有关进出口贸易的机关如银行、海关、税局、运输系统，办理手续应进一步简化，统一步调，否则会影响进口货的流通过程，增加成本，妨碍产销。在这次会议上，工商界代表进行了自我批评，指出私商之间常有“有私无公”的现象，甚至投机取巧。认为这种只顾私利不顾国家政策的作法是错误的。同时他们提出许多积极的改进进出口贸易的建议。如建立打包加工工厂，在重要口岸建立公仓，组织展览会、出口示范农场、国外贸易研究会，出版有关国外贸易的中英文刊物，建立国际商情网，举行各种对外贸易的专业会议等。总计工商界代表等共提出批评与建议等意见共达一百余件。华南对外贸易管理局听取这些意见后，首先对于工商界代表提出的批评进行自我检讨，指出产生这些缺点的原因，是由于贯彻公私兼顾政策做的不够。其次对于工商界代表提出的许多建议，决定进行研究，认为那些可行的，按事情急缓先后，逐步实施。第三，对于经营范围照顾私商不够的问题进行解释。说明土产公司的收购不是包揽一切，从该公司本年六月至十二月的收购计划、在资金上只占广东全省土产生产量百分之七·八便可以看出来。并以数字说明本年一月至五月的出进口贸易实际是私营做的比公营多，从而打破私商在经营范围上的片面看法。最后，华南对外贸易管理局根据公私双方的意见，提出克服目前偏向的主要途径：必须根据统筹兼顾的原则，公私进一步的团结互助，公营加强对私营的领导，把私营普遍组织起来；私营内部也要消除帮派，加紧团结，组织联营，克服本身的弱点，达到改善经营管理，降低生产成本。
    这次会议充分表现公私之间进一步互相了解，互相学习，以及团结的精神。今后把这种精神贯彻下去，华南对外贸易必将迅速推进一步。
