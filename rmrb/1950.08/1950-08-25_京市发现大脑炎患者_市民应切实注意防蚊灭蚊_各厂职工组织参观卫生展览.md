    Encephalitis Patients Discovered in Beijing Municipality
    Citizens Should Seriously Pay Attention to Mosquito Prevention and Elimination
    Factory Workers Organize Visits to Hygiene Exhibition
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Since August, cases of encephalitis have been repeatedly discovered in Beijing. As of the 21st, there have been 58 patients and suspected patients, of whom 23 have died. The Municipal Health Committee convened a meeting of responsible persons from major public and private hospitals in the city on the afternoon of the 21st to discuss the issue of patient accommodation. Public and private hospitals will set aside beds specifically for accommodating encephalitis patients. If citizens discover suspected encephalitis patients, they can first contact the Municipal Public Health Bureau's Epidemic Prevention Team (phone number 2-0494) to facilitate contact with the hospital for a bed. The symptoms of encephalitis are: sudden onset of high fever, headache, and vomiting, followed by coma and convulsions.
    July, August, and September are the months when encephalitis is most likely to spread, with more child patients. There is currently no effective treatment, so the only option is to pay attention to prevention. Therefore, citizens must earnestly eliminate the medium for spreading this disease—mosquitoes—and pay attention to preventing mosquito bites. Patients must be sent to the hospital to prevent transmission.
    [Report from Our Newspaper] The National Hygiene and Pharmaceutical Exhibition has dispatched personnel to factories and government offices in Beijing to make connections in order to attract more workers and the masses to visit. This effort has been highly valued by many units. The Beijing Clothing General Factory issued a blackboard announcement about the exhibition in the factory and informed its various branches to organize workers to visit. The Beijing Tram Company and People's Printing Factory will also organize large numbers of people to visit and plan to hold a forum after the visit, using the exhibition content as learning material, and plan to launch a hygiene campaign. In addition, the Beijing Automobile Company, Electric Light Company, Water Company, Yanjing Paper Mill, and other units will mobilize workers to visit in batches to improve workers' knowledge of hygiene and launch factory hygiene campaigns.

　　京市发现大脑炎患者
    市民应切实注意防蚊灭蚊
    各厂职工组织参观卫生展览
    【京市新闻处讯】京市自八月以来，大脑炎患者屡有发现。截至二十一日止，已有患者及疑似患者五十八人，其中二十三人已死亡。市卫生委员会特于二十一日下午召集本市较大的公私立医院负责人开会，商讨患者收容问题。各公私立医院将留出病床专为收容大脑炎患者之用。市民如发现疑似大脑炎患者时，可先与市公共卫生局防疫队（电话二、○四九四）联系，以便与医院接洽病床。大脑炎的病状是：初起时突发高烧、头痛、呕吐，随后即昏迷、抽风。
    七、八、九三个月是大脑炎最容易流行的时候，以儿童患者较多。目前尚无特效治疗办法，只有注意预防。所以市民要切实消灭传布这种疾病的媒介——蚊子，注意防止蚊子咬。发现患者必须送往医院，以防传染。
    【本报讯】全国卫生医药展览会，为了争取更多的职工群众参观，日前曾派员分赴京市工厂、机关联系，获得很多单位的重视。北京被服总厂在厂内出黑板报报道展览会消息，并通知所属各分厂组织职工前往参观。北京电车公司，人民印刷厂亦将组织大批人员前往参观，并拟在参观后举行座谈，以展览会内容作为学习材料，且拟掀起卫生运动。此外，北京汽车公司、电灯公司、自来水公司、燕京造纸厂等单位均将发动职工分批参观，以提高职工卫生常识，开展工厂卫生运动。
