　　Speech by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang

　　【Xinhua News Agency, 1st】 Speech by Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, at the Beijing rally celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day and demonstrating against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea:

　　Today is the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army—the Chinese people's own armed forces. The People's Liberation Army, after 23 years of arduous struggle, has grown from small to large, from weak to strong, and achieved a basic victory on a national scale, creating a new China under the people's democratic dictatorship!

　　The reason why the People's Liberation Army is powerful is that it is built on the foundation of the people, for the interests of the broad masses of the people, and for the interests of the entire nation, and it is an armed and fighting force united together. This powerful and heroic force has begun to embark on the path of regularization and modernization, becoming a powerful force to ensure China's national defense and defend world democracy and peace.

　　Today, as we celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day, it is of great significance that American imperialists are directly invading Taiwan and Korea with force. Seeing that the Chinese people had overthrown their reactionary rulers with their own strength and eliminated Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary armed forces from the mainland, the American imperialists revealed their ferocious faces, sending their navy to invade Taiwan, attempting to salvage Chiang Kai-shek's dying fate through armed intervention. The American imperialists also saw the strength of the North Korean people's forces, so they instigated their puppet Syngman Rhee to attack North Korea. When the Syngman Rhee bandit army suffered a serious defeat, the American imperialists personally came out to obstruct the Korean people's liberation cause. They also publicly stated that they would strengthen military assistance to the reactionary rulers in Vietnam, the Philippines, Southeast Asia, etc., attempting to suppress the liberation movements of the entire Asian people.

　　The people of Asia have awakened. The American aggressive forces have been constantly suffering shameful defeats in Korea. This has not only hit the American aggressors, but also increased the confidence of the entire oppressed Asian nations in their liberation struggle.

　　Our Chinese People's Liberation Army has already demonstrated unparalleled heroic strength, driving the American aggressive forces and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique out of the Chinese mainland, and achieving unprecedented victories. We have full confidence that the People's Liberation Army will surely drive the enemy out of Taiwan. Taiwan must be liberated, and it will certainly be liberated.

　　Asia belongs to the people of Asia and will never allow American imperialism to interfere in Asian affairs. We believe that the people of Asia will resolutely struggle to restore peace in the Far East, strive for national liberation, and make Asia a free and independent world for the people of Asia.

　　Finally, I would also like to say a few words to the Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers who remain in Taiwan: You have been brought to Taiwan by Chiang Kai-shek and have reached a dead end. Now Chiang Kai-shek is planning to send you to Korea to be accomplices of the United States, to slaughter the Korean people. The further you go astray, the closer you will get to your doom. I call on you to wake up quickly, reject Chiang Kai-shek's orders, sever all relations with imperialism, do not go to Korea as cannon fodder, stop all desperate resistance, and when we march to liberate Taiwan, you should not hesitate to stage an uprising against the enemy or lay down your arms voluntarily; when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang forces you to go to Korea as cannon fodder, you should not hesitate to stand with the Korean People's Army and fight against American imperialism. You can do this, and you should do this. If you do this, not only will the People's Government forgive your past, but the Korean people and the Asian people will regard you as brothers on the same front. This is your last chance to return to the embrace of the motherland and return to the big family of the Asian people.

　　Celebrate the great "August 1st" Army Day! Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　Arise, people of all China, and fight for the liberation of Taiwan!

　　Celebrate the victory of the Korean people! Long live the victory of the Korean war for unification and independence!

　　Arise, people of all Asia, oppose American imperialism's interference in Asian affairs, and fight to restore peace in the Far East and achieve national liberation! Firmly unite in the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and fight to defend world lasting peace!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

　　国民党革命委员会主席
    李济深的演词
    【新华社一日讯】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的演词：
    今天是中国人民解放军——中国人民自己的武装力量——建军二十三周年的纪念日。人民解放军经过了二十三年来的艰苦斗争，从小到大，从弱到强，取得了全国范围内的基本胜利，打出了一个人民民主专政的新中国！
    人民解放军之所以有力量，因为它是建立在人民的基础之上，为广大人民的利益，为全民族的利益，而结合起来的武装战斗的队伍。这个强大英勇的队伍，到今天已经开始走上正规化、现代化的规模，成为保障中国国防，保卫全世界民主和平的一支强大力量。
    我们今天庆祝“八一”建军节，正当着美帝国主义者以武力直接侵略台湾、朝鲜的时候，是有其重大意义的。美帝国主义者眼看着中国人民，用自己的力量，推翻了他们的反动统治者，从大陆上消灭了蒋介石的反动武装，它便露出狰狞面目，派遣他们的海军侵略台湾，企图用武装干涉来挽救蒋介石的垂死命运。美帝国主义又眼看到北朝鲜人民力量的强大，于是嗾使他们傀儡李承晚进攻北朝鲜。当李承晚匪军遭受了严重的失败美帝国主义又亲自出来阻挠朝鲜人民的解放事业。并且还公开声明，对于越南、菲律宾、东南亚……等地的反动统治者将加强军事援助，企图把整个亚洲人民的解放运动镇压下去。
    亚洲人民已经觉醒了，美国的侵略武力，在朝鲜已经不断的遭受了可耻的失败，这不但打击了美国的侵略者，而且也提高了整个亚洲被压迫民族解放斗争的信心。
    我们中国人民解放军已经拿出无比英勇的力量，把美国侵略势力和蒋介石反动集团，驱逐出中国大陆，取得了空前的胜利。我们有充分的信心，人民解放军一定能把敌人逐出台湾，台湾是要解放的，而且也一定能解放的。
    亚洲是亚洲人民的，决不容许美帝国主义干涉亚洲事务，我们相信亚洲人民将坚决奋斗，恢复远东和平，争取民族解放，使亚洲成为亚洲人民自由自主的世界。
    最后，我还要向留在台湾的蒋系官兵们说几句话：你们被蒋介石带到台湾已经是走上末路了。现在蒋介石还打算把你们送到朝鲜去作美国的帮凶，去屠杀朝鲜人民，你们的迷路将愈走愈远，最后只有死路一条。我号召你们赶快觉悟，拒绝蒋介石的命令，断绝与帝国主义的一切关系，不要到朝鲜去当炮灰，停止一切绝望的抵抗，当我们进军解放台湾的时候，你们应该毫不犹豫地实行敌前起义或自动放下武器；在蒋介石匪帮强迫驱使你们到朝鲜作炮灰的时候，你们也应该毫不犹豫地和朝鲜人民军站在一起，向美帝国主义作战。你们可以这样做，而且也应当这样做，你们这样做了，不但人民政府可以宽恕你们的以往，而且朝鲜人民，亚洲人民都将把你们当作站在一条战线上的兄弟看待。这是你们回到祖国怀抱，回到亚洲人民大家庭的最后的机会了。
    庆祝伟大的“八一”建军节，中国人民解放军万岁！
    起来，全中国的人民，为解放台湾而斗争！
    庆祝朝鲜人民的胜利，朝鲜的统一和独立战争胜利万岁！
    起来，全亚洲的人民，反对美帝国主义干涉亚洲事务，为恢复远东和平实现民族解放而斗争！坚决团结在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，为保卫世界持久和平而斗争！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
