　　Nanling County Exposes Serious Policy Violations in Rectification Movement

[Our Dispatch] Since the rectification movement began in Nanling County, Southern Anhui, on July 20th, it has been closely integrated with work. In the past half month, many serious problems of policy violations and detachment from the masses have been discovered. First, in terms of agricultural tax collection, most cadres did not act in accordance with policies. The higher levels made blind arrangements, and the lower levels increased quotas at each level, thus forming a phenomenon of extreme unevenness. In the process of collection, deadlines and quotas were also set, which fueled the commanding style of the lower-level cadres, and even used illegal means such as tying, hanging, and beating, which violated human rights. The leadership failed to detect this in time. The villages and cadres that were most violent in beating people, and thus turned in the most grain, were even praised. When establishing village governments, the leadership did not go deep into the grassroots to mobilize the masses, but relied solely on orders to establish governments. As a result, feudal forces infiltrated and manipulated many village governments, engaging in corruption and bending the law, seriously violating policies. Such villages accounted for 23 percent of all villages in the county. The same was true in the work of repairing dikes. At the beginning of the engineering survey, the county leadership showed extreme neglect of this huge project, which was related to the lives and property of 100,000 people, and completely handed over the survey work to a few technicians. After the project started, they did not conduct thorough inspections, but only wanted numbers, resulting in the phenomenon of falsely reporting numbers. For example, Chong Sheng Village in the Eighth District falsely reported 13,000 cubic meters of earthwork and fraudulently received more than 5,000 jin of public grain. Such corruption was not detected for a long time. The chaotic state of grain management departments was also extremely serious. In the public grain collected last year, the county actually collected 21 million jin of grain. In order to leave a loophole, only 19 million jin were reported. This was not discovered until the thorough cleaning of warehouses during the implementation of financial and economic unification. This seriously affected the higher authorities' control and allocation of grain. Some of the grain was stored in private rice mills, and 173,000 jin were used without authorization, and have not yet been fully returned. Most of the district and village cooperative branches have experienced corruption, seriously damaging the interests of the masses. The Fourth District Branch recently found corruption of materials worth about 10,000 jin of rice. Furthermore, in terms of business policy, they lacked a mass line, simply pursued profits, and reduced the cooperative to an ordinary store. The People's Bank also repeatedly violated policies in lending, not using loans to support production, but lending to theaters. There were even more problems with tax collection. Similarly, they only wanted numbers, regardless of policies, and never conducted in-depth investigations and research at the grassroots level. Even if unreasonable issues were discovered, they failed to pay attention to adjustments in time. When examining the reasons, the county party committee believed that the primary reason was that the county party committee leadership had a serious bureaucratic work style, and could not grasp the real situation in all aspects, and could not lead the work of the county, causing all departments to repeatedly violate policies and continue to use coercion and commandism. Therefore, the rectification movement first requires the leadership to conduct self-examination from top to bottom and from bottom to top, in order to thoroughly change the leadership style, and then examine the work of the departments. Currently, all departments in the county are conducting in-depth inspections of their work and combining this with reading documents.

### 南陵县整风运动中揭发严重违反政策现象

　　南陵县整风运动中揭发严重违反政策现象
    【本报讯】皖南南陵县自七月二十日开始整风以来，由于与工作密切结合，半个月来发现了不少违反政策、脱离群众的严重问题。首先是在征收农业税方面，大部分干部不按照政策行事，上面盲目布置，下面逐级加数，因此形成畸重畸轻的现象。在征收过程中，又限期限数，助长了下面干部的强迫命令作风，甚至使用捆、吊、打等侵犯人权的非法手段。对此，领导上均未及时发觉，甚至对打人最凶、因而缴粮最多的村子和干部，还加以表扬。在建立村政权时，领导上不深入下层发动群众，单靠命令建立政权。结果很多村政权中被封建势力混入，把持操纵，贪赃卖法，严重的违犯了政策。此类村子竟占全县村子的百分之二十三。在修圩工作中也是如此。开始勘估工程时，县领导上对此关系十万群众生命财产安全的巨大工程，表现极端忽视，将勘估工作完全交给几个技术人员去作。工程开始后又不深入检查，光要数字，以致形成虚报数字的现象。如第八区崇圣村便虚报土方一万三千方之多，冒领公粮五千余斤。此类贪污事件，长期没有发觉。粮食管理部门的混乱状态也极为严重，去年征收公粮中，全县实征粮二千一百万斤。为了留后手，仅上报一千九百万斤。此事直到实现财经统一彻底清理仓库时，才被发觉。这就严重的影响了上级对粮食的掌握调配。还有些因为存入私人砻坊，其中竟被动用十七万三千余斤，至今归还不齐。各区村合作分社大部分发生贪污现象，严重损害了群众利益。四区分社最近即查出贪污物资约值一万斤稻米。并且在经营方针上是缺乏群众路线，单纯追求利润，把合作社降为普通商店。人民银行在贷款方面也是屡次违犯政策，贷款不用于扶助生产事业，而贷予剧院。税收工作的毛病更多，同样是只要数字，不问政策，始终未深入下层调查研究。即使发现不合理的也未能及时注意调整。检查原因时，县委认为首先是因为县委领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风，不能掌握各方面的真实情况，无法领导全县工作，致使各部门一再违犯政策，继续强迫命令。因此，整风中首先要求自上而下与自下而上的检查领导，以彻底改变领导作风，然后检查部门工作。目前该县各部门正深入检查工作，并结合阅读文件。（中共南陵县委会研究员吴运兴）
