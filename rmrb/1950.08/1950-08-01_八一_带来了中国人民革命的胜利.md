　　"August 1st" Brought Victory to the Chinese People's Revolution
　　Zhang Bojun

　　The Nanchang Uprising, which created Chinese revolutionary history, is now twenty-three years old. The advanced forces of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, developed from the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, have always held high the banner of armed struggle, pointed out the direction of victory for the Chinese people, and resolutely implemented the great task of anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucrat capitalism.

　　Stalin said: The characteristics and advantages of the Chinese revolution are the armed people's forces opposing the armed counter-revolution. Since its founding, the People's Liberation Army has developed from nothing to something, from small to large, through ten years of civil war with the counter-revolutionary groups, eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and four years of the War of Liberation. It is good at strengthening itself in difficulties; it has the ability to disintegrate the enemy and supplement itself; it is good at uniting the masses and establishing the foundation for its growth and development among the broad masses; it is even more capable of bravely seizing the enemy's weapons to equip itself; it has written many military historical miracles in countless battles.

　　The people's army, tested and tempered by fire and blood, has finally built itself into an invincible and unconquerable steel force. Under the education of Marxism-Leninism, it is full of a high degree of class consciousness. Every soldier can consciously know why they are fighting, understand the present and future of the Chinese revolution, have a high degree of discipline, be brave and strong against the enemy, and have a firm integrity, and be gentle and sincere to the people and show them love and care. It has been proven by facts to be the most progressive and excellent army in the world.

　　Chairman Mao once said: The reason why the People's Liberation Army is powerful is that they are not fighting for the private interests of a few people or narrow groups, but for the just people's war and for the interests of the broad masses of the people. This shows that this army is established to protect the people and suppress the reactionaries, and is organized on the basis of the masses of the people. Because it has a unique style and quality, it has a high degree of patriotism and a high degree of internationalism.

　　As the Chinese Liberation War has declared basic victory, and the peace-loving people of the world are united in struggle, the United States, in addition to launching a war of aggression against Korea, has also shown its actions to prevent us from liberating Taiwan. This ferocious and unscrupulous act of imperialism is the same as that of Japan, Germany, and Italy in the past. Therefore, we can also conclude that it will inevitably suffer the same fate as Japan, Germany, and Italy.

　　The power of the people cannot be insulted; the torrent of the times is driving the people's power forward; the despicable behavior of American imperialism cannot only not scare the Chinese people, but on the contrary, it can give them great stimulus and encouragement in the struggle against the United States and the elimination of the reactionary remnants; as Premier Zhou said: No matter what obstructive actions the American imperialists take, the fact that Taiwan belongs to China can never be changed; we have the power to complete our liberation cause from the clutches of the demons. All our people will inevitably follow the people's army under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and strike at the invaders.

　　We are against wars of aggression, but only by preparing sufficient strength can we stop acts of aggression and prevent the outbreak of war.

　　In the past twenty-three years, we have overcome all military difficulties and basically completed the task of eliminating the Kuomintang reactionaries. The focus in the future, in addition to strengthening the People's National Defense Forces and modernizing construction to have the power to destroy any imperialist aggression, is to shoulder the responsibility of being a peace-loving human guardian to maintain lasting world peace. Our country is about to shift from military victory to the task of economic and cultural construction. The people's warriors will exert their powerful power on the construction battlefield to accelerate the progress of the country. This is a foreseeable prospect.

　　I am particularly excited and moved to have such a glorious opportunity today to express my highest respect and warmest congratulations to our great leader Chairman Mao, our wise Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all comrades and soldiers. As early as twenty-three years ago today, I was under the leadership of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Premier Zhou, and other CCP comrades, in the great scene of the glorious Nanchang Uprising, serving as a small pawn. At that time, I certainly found the people's side; but in the end, because my understanding was not deep enough and my will was not strong enough, I did not persevere and left this arduous and glorious journey of the great people's military struggle, which is a great regret for me. However, I was able to gradually move forward through a tortuous path of struggle, relying on the direction of the people, like a straggler who caught up again.

　　This is a story worth self-alerting, and I want to thank the many CCP comrades for the help and guidance they have given me over the past twenty years.

### “八一”带来了中国人民革命的胜利

　　“八一”带来了中国人民革命的胜利
    章伯钧
    创造中国革命历史的南昌武装起义，到现在已经是二十三周年了；那是中国人民的先进力量，在中国共产党领导下，由中国工农红军发展到八路军、新四军和中国人民解放军，一直是举着武装斗争的旗子，指出中国人民胜利的方向，坚决地执行了反帝反封建反官僚资本的伟大任务。
    斯大林说过：中国革命的特点与优点，是武装的人民力量，来反对武装的反革命。人民解放军自建军以来，经过与反革命集团进行的十年内战，八年的抗日战争，和四年来的解放战争，是在由无到有由小到大的过程发展而来的。它善于在困难中壮大自己；它有本事瓦解敌军，以补充自己；它善于团结群众，把自己生长和发展的根基，建立在广大的群众里面；它更能英勇的夺取敌人的武装，来装备自己；它在无数次的战役中，写下了许许多多军事上的历史奇迹。
    人民的军队，是在火与血考验与锻炼下，终于建立成一支无坚不摧，无攻不克的钢铁力量。它在马列主义教育下，富有高度的阶级觉悟，每个战士能够自觉他们为什么打仗，懂得中国革命的现在与未来，有高度的纪律，对敌人则英勇坚强，而有坚贞的气节，对人民则温和诚恳予以爱护。它已被事实证明为世界上进步而优秀的军队。
    毛主席曾说过：人民解放军之所以有力量，就是因为他们不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着正义的人民战争，为着广大人民群众的利益而斗争的。这说明了这个军队是为保护人民和镇压反动派而设的，是在人民大众的基础上组织起来的。因为它有特具的风格与素质，它有高度的爱国主义，同时也有高度的国际主义精神。
    当中国解放战争已宣告基本胜利，和全世界和平人民团结奋斗的今天，美国除发动侵略朝鲜的战争之外，还表现出阻挡我们解放台湾的行动，这种穷凶极恶公然无忌的帝国主义行为，可与过去的日本、德国和意大利相同，因此我们也就可以断定它必与日本、德国、意大利等遭到同一的命运。
    人民的力量，是不可侮的；时代的巨流，正在推动人民的力量，向前激进；美帝国主义的卑劣行为，不但不能吓住中国人民，相反地这在反美和消灭反动残余的斗争上，更可予以莫大的刺激与鼓励；正如周总理所说：不管美国帝国主义者，采取任何阻挠的行动，台湾属于中国的事实，永远不能改变；我们有力量从魔掌中，完成我们解放的事业。我们全国人民，必然是在毛主席和朱总司令领导下，紧跟着人民的队伍，予侵略者以打击。
    我们是反对侵略战争的，但惟有准备了十足的力量，才能制止侵略的行为，才能制止战争的爆发。
    过去二十三年中，我们克服了军事上的一切困难，基本上完成了消灭国民党反动派的任务。今后的重点，除要加强人民国防军，现代化的建设，有力量摧毁任何帝国主义的侵略以外，还得负起和平人类卫士的责任，以维护世界的持久和平。我们的国家，即将由军事的胜利，而转变到经济文化建设的任务。人民的战士们，将要在建设的战场上发挥出强大的威力，来加速国家的进步，这是可以预见的前景。
    我能在今天获得这样光荣的机会，来向我们伟大的领袖毛主席英明的朱总司令以及全体战友和战士表达我的最高的敬意和最热烈的祝贺，这对我是特别令人感奋的激动。远在二十三年前的今天，我是在朱总司令周总理和其他中共同志领导下，在光荣的南昌起义的伟大场面中，是充当一个小卒的。在当时我固然找到了人民的方面；但终于因为认识不够深入，意志不够坚强，而没有坚持下去，离开了这一伟大人民军事斗争的艰苦而又光荣的旅程，这在我是极大的遗憾。然而我毕竟能经过曲曲折折的奋斗的途径，靠着人民的方向，慢慢的走向前来，又好像一个掉了队又赶上来的半老的小兵。
    这是一段值得自我警惕的故事，要感谢二十余年来许多中共的同志所给我的帮助和指导。
