　　Chinese Workers Fight for Peace
    Zhuang Puming
    The Chinese working class is conducting an active struggle across the nation to defend world peace. The peace signature campaign has reached a fervent climax in railways, factories, and mines throughout the country. In addition to eagerly signing themselves and mobilizing their families to sign enthusiastically, workers are expressing their firm will and strength to defend world peace with practical actions to step up production.

    More than 400,000 railway employees across the country have signed the peace declaration. They not only signed themselves but also mobilized their families to sign. All 1,500 employees at 28 stations along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway signed, and also mobilized more than 3,500 family members to sign. Within four days of the start of the signature campaign, the crew members on the Wuhu-Shitangwan section mobilized over 8,000 passengers to sign. Railway employees in various locations have also extended the signature campaign to the broad masses of the people. Employees of stations such as Luoshe, Shitangwan, and Xinzha Town along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, as well as workers at the Tangshan Railway Machinery Plant, organized propaganda teams to go to the streets and rural areas to promote the signature campaign. Signature stations have been set up in waiting rooms of major stations across the country to collect signatures from passing passengers. The campaign to collect signatures for the peace declaration has also been enthusiastically launched on trains along the Shanghai-Nanjing, Jiaoji, and Baoji-Zhengzhou railway lines. On the Nanjing-Shanghai train on June 29, conductors collected signatures from all 292 passengers, excluding those who had already signed. Within a month of launching the peace signature campaign on various trains and at Chang'an Station, railway employees in Xi'an collected signatures from more than 15,000 passengers. Passengers on the Peace Train on the Jiaoji line, after in-depth propaganda by railway employees, expressed their determination to bring the determination to defend world peace to every city and village. After getting off the train at Chengyang Nangguan Xiang Qingyun told his neighbor Zhang Desan the meaning of the peace signature, and Zhang Desan immediately signed. A passenger from Boshan, Zhao Youlin, said after signing: I will definitely tell the whole village about this important event and mobilize all the villagers to sign the peace declaration. According to statistics, more than 50,000 members of the Communist Youth League in the national railway system alone have mobilized 100,000 family members of employees and passing passengers to participate in the signature campaign.

    In addition to responding to the peace signature campaign with unparalleled enthusiasm, employees in factories across the country are also launching production competitions to express their enthusiasm for defending world peace. Many factories in Shanghai have launched red banner competitions for peace signatures. Among the 3,311,514 signatories in the city, workers account for 1,278,000, accounting for 38.5 percent of the city's total signatories. In Jilin City, 20,687 employees have signed, accounting for nearly 100 percent of the city's total employees. The enthusiasm for production of employees has greatly increased during the peace signature campaign. Hao Zhongshui and 16 other electrician workers at the No. 41 Factory in Jilin City, in order to complete the production tasks ahead of schedule to strengthen the forces for defending world peace, completed the day's task of 1,400 flange bolts before 2 p.m. on the day they launched the signature campaign in the factory. All employees of the Qingdao Power Plant stated after signing: "Not only will we defend world peace with the signature campaign, but we will also step up production to support the front line, strive for the early liberation of Taiwan, and defend world peace with practical actions."

    In mines, the peace signature campaign has been warmly supported and responded to by the vast number of employees. More than 19,300 people have signed in the Jixi Coal Mine area in Northeast China. All 6,076 miners at the Fengfeng Coal Mine signed within three days of the launch of the signature campaign. Before the launch of the peace signature campaign, the mines in the Zibo Industrial and Mining Special Zone of Shandong Province generally conducted peace signature seminars and reports. Within three days, more than 41,200 people in the entire zone participated in the peace signature campaign. Within two and a half days, 1,832 employees of the Linyi Coal Mine signed. Employees of the Qinhuangdao Yiqun Coal Plant wrote after signing: "We need peace, and we resolutely oppose aggressive wars." In many areas, employees also affixed their fingerprints after signing to show the solemnity and solemnity of their determination to defend peace.

    Workers in various other industries across the country have unanimously and actively participated in the peace signature campaign. In this struggle for peace, Chinese workers are united with the people of the whole country and peace-loving people all over the world; and are striving to defend world peace with practical actions to step up production in various different production posts. This is a powerful force in the camp of peace and democracy, which can undoubtedly give a major blow to war instigators.

　　中国工人为和平而斗争
    庄浦明
    中国工人阶级为了保卫世界和平，正在全国各地进行着积极的斗争。在全国各铁路、工厂、矿山，和平签名运动已经进入热烈的高潮。职工们除了自己争先签名和发动家属踊跃签名，并纷纷以加紧生产的实际行动来表示他们对保卫世界和平坚决的意志与力量。
    全国各地的铁路员工已有四十多万人在和平宣言上签名。他们不但自己签了名，并且发动家属签名。沪宁路二十八个车站的一千五百余个职工都签了名，同时发动了家属三千五百余人签名，芜湖至石塘湾段的乘务人员在签名运动开始后的四天内并发动了八千多个旅客签名。各地的铁路员工们还把签名运动推展到广大的人民群众中去。沪宁路上的洛社、石塘湾、新闸镇等车站及唐山市铁路机厂的职工，组织了宣传队出动到街头和农村进行签名运动的宣传。全国各地主要车站的候车室都设立了签名处，征集来往旅客签名，在沪宁、胶济、宝（宝鸡）郑（郑州）等段铁路的列车上也热烈地展开了为和平宣言而签名的征集运动。在六月二十九日南京至上海的列车上，车务员们征集了除掉已经签过的旅客以外共二百九十二人全都签了名。西安铁路职工在各次列车和长安车站上发动和平签名运动的一个月内，即征集了一万五千多名旅客签名。胶济线上和平列车的旅客们经过铁路员工深入宣传后，都表示要把保卫世界和平的决心带到每个城市和农村中去。城阳南关相庆云下车后即把和平签名的意义告诉了他的邻友张德三，张德三立即签了名。博山旅客赵友林在签名后说：我一定把这件大事告诉全村，动员全村人民在和平宣言上签名。据统计，仅全国铁路系统中的五万多个青年团员，即发动了职工家属和来往旅客有十万人参加签名。
    全国各地工厂中的职工们除以无比的热情响应和平签名运动以外，并展开生产竞赛来表示对保卫世界和平的积极性。上海市的许多工厂都展开了和平签名的红旗竞赛。在全市已有的三百三十一万一千五百一十四个签名者中，工人占一百二十七万八千人，占该市签名总人数的百分之三十八点五。吉林市已有二万零六百八十七个职工签名，占该市职工总数的将近百分之百。职工们在和平签名运动中生产积极性大大提高。吉林市的四一工厂修电工人郝忠水等十七人，为提前完成生产任务来壮大保卫世界和平的力量，他们在全厂展开签名运动的那天，不到下午两点钟就完成了全天一千四百个法兰盘螺丝的任务。青岛电厂的全体职工在签名后表示：“不但要以签名运动来保卫世界和平，更要加紧生产支援前线，争取早日解放台湾，用实际行动来保卫世界和平。”
    在矿山，和平签名运动得到广大的职工的热烈拥护与响应。东北鸡西煤矿区已有一万九千三百多人签名。峰峰煤矿全体矿工六千零七十六人，在签名运动发动后的三天内都签了名。山东淄博工矿特区的矿山在和平签名运动发动前普遍进行了和平签名的座谈和报告，三天内全区参加和平签名的即达四万一千二百余人。临沂煤矿的职工在二天半内即有一千八百三十二人签名。秦皇岛一群煤厂的职工在签名后写道：“我们需要和平，我们坚决反对侵略战争。”许多地区的职工并在签名后按上指印，以表示他们保卫和平决心的郑重和庄严。
    全国其他各地各种行业的工人，都一致地积极地参加了和平签名运动。中国工人在这为和平而斗争中与全国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民团结一致；并在各种不同的生产岗位上以加紧生产的实际行动为保卫世界和平而努力奋斗。这是和平民主阵营中一支强大的力量，无疑地可以给予战争挑拨者重大的打击。
