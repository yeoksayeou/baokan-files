Examining the Working Style of Local Governments from the Yanggao Measles Epidemic
    The Yanggao County Democratic Construction Work Group of the Central People's Government Political and Legal Affairs Committee
    This spring, measles became epidemic in Yanggao County, Chahar Province. It was first discovered in the southern part of the county, and due to ineffective prevention and control, it later spread to most districts and villages. The situation was serious. In one village, 60 to 70 people died. There were even cases where all four or five children in a family died. At that time, the production enthusiasm of the masses was very low. The villages were filled with the sound of women crying, and some rural primary schools were forced to close. The work group of the Central People's Government Political and Legal Affairs Committee, which was sent to Chahar Province to carry out democratic construction, arrived in the county on May 23. After discovering this situation, they immediately reported it to the Chahar Provincial Government and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government. Later, the provincial and central epidemic prevention teams arrived in the county to provide emergency assistance, which stopped the spread and cured many sick children. As of the end of June, statistics showed that a total of 712 children had died in the county, causing significant losses to the people. An examination of the causes of the measles epidemic in Yanggao County reveals that, on the one hand, the area suffered from famine last year, and the people's lives were difficult. The children were malnourished, had weak resistance, and were prone to disease. Moreover, due to improper care, complications easily arose (most deaths were due to complications such as pneumonia). After getting sick, people either could not afford or did not seek medical treatment in time. In addition, many people were deeply superstitious and unwilling to seek medical treatment, often seeking help from gods and Buddhas. In Gushanmiao Village, Ninth District alone, 800 chickens were "offered" to the Grandma Temple.

    However, the more important factor is that there are problems with the working style of our local government. As early as February this year, measles had already become epidemic in the county. The county leadership did not give it due attention. It was not until the deaths became severe that they telegraphed the Special Commissioner's Office three times and reported on the situation at two meetings convened by the Special Commissioner's Office, while sending doctors to the countryside for treatment. However, the Special Commissioner's Office failed to clearly indicate how to handle the matter effectively. Instead, due to a lack of medicine, prevention and control knowledge, and experience, they pessimistically delayed, forming a passive state of allowing the epidemic to develop. The masses reflected, "The government attaches great importance to the plague, cutting off transportation. So many people have died from measles, which is even more terrible than the plague. Why doesn't the government care?" This criticism deserves the attention of our government workers.

    This incident tells us that the people's greatest demand at present is to restore and develop production. However, in order to better inspire the people's production enthusiasm, it is necessary to solve a series of problems that may hinder or affect the restoration and development of production (such as promoting democracy, guaranteeing human rights, property rights, and land rights, preventing and controlling diseases, etc.) around the central task of restoring and developing production. The view that simply leading production and placing those things in opposition to production is wrong. The masses reflected, "If people are all dead, what is the point of production? Who are we working for?" This also teaches us that in the future, when leading production, we must comprehensively consider all urgent issues, especially major issues related to the life, death, and well-being of the people, and we must attach great importance to them and earnestly take responsibility.

    This also illustrates that there are still problems with the current reporting system in local work. It is right to report level by level and be responsible for handling matters level by level; however, for major, serious, and urgent issues, it is not necessary to mechanically report level by level. The county can report to the Special Commissioner's Office and simultaneously copy the report to the province and even the central government in order to obtain timely solutions. If the Special Commissioner's Office delays in handling the matter again, the county can also directly report to the provincial government to request instructions for handling. The lesson of the Yanggao measles incident shows that when government workers handle official business and deal with problems, they must be good at distinguishing between what is important and urgent. This responsible attitude is necessary.

    Editor's Note: We believe that the opinions put forward by the Yanggao County Democratic Construction Work Group of the Central People's Government Political and Legal Affairs Committee regarding the Yanggao County measles epidemic are worthy of attention. As far as we know, government workers and leading organs in many regions often neglect certain problems that urgently need to be solved and that are related to the interests of the broad masses of people because they only pay attention to central work, which often causes the masses to suffer unnecessary or avoidable losses. This is precisely a manifestation of bureaucracy that does not care about the interests of the masses. We hope that everyone can learn a lesson from this incident in Yanggao County and improve their leadership style and working methods.

　　从阳高麻疹流行事件中检讨地方政府的工作作风
    中央人民政府政法委员会阳高建政工作组
    察哈尔省阳高县今春麻疹流行。先在南部发现，因防治不力，后即蔓延大部区村。情况严重，有一村死亡六、七十人者，甚至有全家四、五个小孩死光者。群众生产情绪当时很低落，村里一片妇女哭声，部分乡村小学陷于停顿。中央人民政府政法委员会派赴察省进行民主建政的工作组五月二十三日到达该县发现此种情况后，立即报告察哈尔省府和中央人民政府卫生部，后经省及中央防疫队到县抢救，始停止蔓延，并治好不少病儿。截至六月底，统计全县共死小孩七百十二名，造成人民重大损失。考查阳高县这次麻疹流行的原因，一方面是当地去年遭受灾荒，人民生活困难，小孩营养不足，抵抗力弱，易致疾病，并因护理不当，易生合并症（死亡者多为合并肺炎等症），得病后亦无力或不及时请医治疗，还有许多群众迷信太深，不愿请医，往往求神拜佛，仅九区孤山庙村奶奶庙“供鸡”即达八百只。
    但更重要的还是我们地方政府的工作作风上有问题。今春二月间，该县麻疹即已流行，县领导方面未予以应有的重视，直至死亡严重时，才三次电报专署，并在专署两次召开的会议上提出报告，一面派医下乡治疗。但专署又未能明示办法抓紧处理，反因医药缺乏，无防治知识与经验，就此无信心地拖延下来，形成消极地听任疫病发展的状态。群众反映：“政府对鼠疫很重视，断绝交通；麻疹死这样多人，比鼠疫还厉害，政府为啥也不管？”这一批评，是值得我们政府工作人员注意的。
    这件事告诉我们：当前人民最大的要求是恢复与发展生产，但为了更好地启发人民的生产积极性，需要环绕着恢复与发展生产这一中心任务，解决可能解决的一系列的有碍或影响恢复与发展生产的问题（如发扬民主，保障人权、财权、地权，防治疾病等等），单纯地领导生产而把那些事与生产对立起来的看法是错误的。群众反映：“人都死光了，还生产干什么？给谁过光景呢？”这也教育了我们，今后在领导生产中必须周密地全面地考虑各方面迫切的问题，特别是有关人民生死祸福的重大问题，必须予以高度的重视，切实负起责任。
    这里也说明了目前地方工作中的报告制度还有问题。逐级报告，逐级负责办事，这是对的；但属于重大而严重紧急的问题，就不一定机械地逐级层报：县可于报告专署的同时，抄报省直至中央，以求及时获得解决。专署若再拖延不处理，县也可直接报告省府请示处理。这次阳高麻疹事件的教训，说明我们政府工作人员办公事和处理问题时，必须善于区别轻重缓急，这种负责态度是必要的。
    编者按：中央人民政府政法委员会阳高建政工作组对阳高县麻疹流行事件所提出的意见，我们认为是值得重视的。据我们所知，不少地区的政府工作人员和领导机关，常因仅仅注意了中心工作，而忽视了某些关系广大人民利益的迫切需要解决的问题，往往使群众遭受不应有的或可以减少的损失，这正是一种不关心群众利益的官僚主义的表现。我们希望大家能从阳高县这次事件中得到教训，改进领导作风和工作方法。
