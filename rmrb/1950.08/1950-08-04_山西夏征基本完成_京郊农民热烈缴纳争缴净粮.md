Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 2nd. Shanxi Province has basically completed its summer grain tax task. This year, Shanxi Province plans to collect 164,590,238 jin of wheat. As of now, 125,873,257 jin have been stored, accounting for 76.47 percent of the total summer grain tax. Jinan, the main wheat-producing area, with 28 counties, has completed an average of 95.8 percent of its task, of which Yuncheng Prefecture is close to 100 percent. In Linfen Prefecture, Hongdong, Zhaocheng and other four counties have not only completed their tasks, but also cleared the old debts from the autumn tax last year. Changzhi, Xingxian, and Xinxian Prefectures started collecting later due to the late wheat harvest, but will also begin storing in early August.

(Our Newspaper) The summer grain tax collection in the suburbs of Beijing has entered the stage of grain delivery. In order to take care of the disaster situation and the emancipated peasants, the Nineteenth District People's Government appropriately adjusted the phenomenon of excessive lightness or heaviness of the previous year, and reduced and exempted 100,000 jin of public grain (accounting for a quarter of the total), which was warmly supported by the peasants. The peasants' enthusiasm for grain delivery is exceptionally high, and they are competing to deliver clean grain. Lugou Administrative Village has launched a "grain sieving campaign", and the sieves in the whole village are too busy. The peasants in the village said: If we don't hand in good grain now, we will really be letting ourselves down. On the first day of collection (July 25), more than 100 households handed in their grain. Bajiao Administrative Village loaded seven large carts on the first day, and the peasants happily sent them to the granary. In Yangzhuang Natural Village, only two households out of more than 100 households have not yet delivered.

The district originally scheduled to end the collection work on August 3, but it may be completed ahead of schedule because the peasants were prepared early.

(Another Dispatch) The Nineteenth District combined the summer grain tax arrangements with the campaign against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea, explaining to the vast number of peasants that actively paying public grain is a practical action to oppose American imperialism and support the front line. Party and League members and cadres of farmers' associations and women's federations in various villages have guaranteed to play a leading role in the collection. They all believe that to repel the obstruction of American imperialism, liberate the people of Taiwan, and build a new China, we must enthusiastically pay public grain.

　　山西夏征基本完成
    京郊农民热烈缴纳争缴净粮
    【新华社太原二日电】山西省夏征任务已基本完成。今年山西全省计划征小麦一亿六千四百五十九万零二百三十八斤，至目前为止，入库已达一亿二千五百八十七万三千二百五十七斤，占夏征总数的百分之七十六点四七。主要产麦地区晋南二十八县，平均已完成任务百分之九十五点八，其中运城专区已近百分之百。临汾专区之洪洞、赵城等四县除已完成任务外，并收清了去年秋征中的旧欠。长治、兴县、忻县等三个专区因麦收晚而开征较迟，但八月初亦将开始入库。
    【本报讯】京郊夏征已进入缴粮阶段。十九区人民政府为照顾灾情与翻身农民，适当地调整了去年畸轻畸重的现象，减免了公粮十万斤（占总数的四分之一），得到农民的热烈拥护。农民缴粮情绪异常高涨，争缴净粮。鲁谷行政村已展开“筛粮运动”，全村筛子已忙不过来。该村农民都说：现在再不缴好粮食，可真连自己也对不起了。在开征的第一天（七月二十五日）即有一百余户缴上了。八角行政村第一天装了七大车，农民高高兴兴地送到粮库去，所属杨庄自然村一百余户，只剩两户未缴。
    该区原定八月三日结束此项征收工作，因农民早有准备，可能提前完成。

    【又讯】十九区这次布置夏征结合反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动进行了宣传，对广大农民说明了积极缴公粮就是反对美帝、支援前线的实际行动。各村党、团员及农会、妇联的干部们都保证在征收中起带头作用。他们都认为：要击退美帝国主义的阻挠，解放台湾人民，建设新中国，只有踊跃缴纳公粮。
