　　People's Court Work Should Continue to Improve
　　Cheng Fang
    People's courts in various regions have made great achievements in punishing counter-revolutionary criminals, protecting national economic construction and people's property, penalizing those who violate the law and are derelict in their duties, and resolving mass disputes. The judicial system of the Kuomintang reactionary government and the Six Codes have been abolished, and revolutionary laws and trial systems that protect the interests of the people have been implemented. The old prison system that simply punished criminals has been transformed into a new prison system that combines punishment and control with education and reform, and has already transformed a large number of criminals into new people.
    However, there are also many shortcomings in our judicial work, which deserve the serious attention of judicial workers. For example, in handling counter-revolutionary cases, some local judicial organs have adopted a policy of "boundless leniency" towards special agents, bandits, local bullies, and other counter-revolutionary elements who seriously endanger the interests of the people, causing lurking special agents and bandits to believe that the people can be deceived, and continue to carry out activities, causing losses to the interests of the country and the people.
    Some court trial personnel do not pay enough attention to investigation and research, and sometimes even engage in beating and scolding people. In prison administration work, some one-sidedly emphasize education and reform, neglecting the control work of the prison, often allowing major criminals to escape and continue to harm the people. The basic reason for these biases is that the policy level of some cadres is not high. Only by gradually improving the policy level of cadres and strengthening leadership and inspection work can these biases be thoroughly corrected.
    In addition, the backlog of cases is a fairly common phenomenon. Some cases have been delayed for several months without a verdict, or have not been executed after the verdict. Although this situation has its objective reasons (such as the small number and low quality of cadres), unscientific working methods are also an important reason. To solve this problem, the on-site trials or circuit trials adopted by the people's courts in Hebei, Pingyuan, Dalian, Tianjin, Shenyang, Shanghai, Gui Sui, Xi'an, Fushun, Daye and other places are worthy of attention. This method has simple procedures, can save the time and expenses of the working people, and is convenient for contacting the masses, conducting in-depth investigation and understanding, so that cases can be handled correctly and in a timely manner.
    In the northeastern and northern provinces, major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and parts of the northwest, east China, and central and southern regions, people's courts have drawn manpower to clear up backlogged cases, and have also achieved considerable results. During the period of clearing up cases from May 20th to June 22nd this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Court transferred more than 200 cadres and university students from various municipal government agencies to participate in the work, and cleared up 4,328 backlogged cases as scheduled. In the work of clearing up backlogged cases in May, the Wuhan Municipal People's Court organized a Backlogged Case Clearing Committee, transferred more than 100 cadres and students, divided them into eight working groups according to administrative divisions, went deep into various districts to clear up backlogged cases, and also solved many problems. The Shanghai Municipal People's Court was reorganized in March this year, abolishing the original Mediation Committee and establishing criminal and civil divisions under the Trial Committee. Due to the strengthening of manpower and the increase in the enthusiasm of court staff, the case closure efficiency of both criminal and civil divisions has been significantly improved. If the courts in various regions can actively and proactively come up with more solutions, they will surely create more experience.

　　人民法院工作应继续改进
    成坊
    各地人民法院在惩治反革命罪犯、保护国家经济建设和人民财产、处罚违法渎职分子、解决群众纠纷等工作中有了很大的成绩。国民党反动政府的司法制度与六法全书废除了，保护人民利益的革命法律与审判制度实行了。单纯惩罚犯人的旧监狱制度，变成了惩罚管制与教育改造相结合的新监狱制度，并已把大批犯人改造成为新人。
    但在我们的司法工作中，也存在着不少缺点，值得司法工作者严重注意。例如在处理反革命案件方面，有些地方司法机关对严重危害人民利益的特务、土匪、恶霸及其他反革命分子，采取了“宽大无边”的政策，使潜伏的特务匪徒认为人民可欺，继续进行活动，使国家与人民的利益遭受损失。
    有些法院审判人员不够重视调查研究工作，有时甚至有打人、骂人的现象。而在狱政工作中，有的片面强调教育改造，忽略了监狱的管制工作，往往使重大罪犯脱逃，继续搅害人民。产生这些偏向的基本原因是部分干部的政策水平不高。只有逐步提高干部的政策水平，加强领导和检查工作，才能彻底纠正这些偏向。
    此外，积压案件是带有相当普遍性的现象。有的案件竟拖好几个月不得判决，或者是判决以后没有执行。这种情况虽有其客观原因（如干部量少质弱），但工作方法不科学，也是重要原因之一。为解决这一问题，河北、平原、大连、天津、沈阳、上海、归绥、西安、抚顺、大冶等地人民法院曾经采用的就地审判或巡回审判方式是值得重视的。这种方式手续简便，能节省劳动人民的时间和费用，便于联系群众、深入调查了解，使案件获得正确的及时的处理。
    在东北和华北各省，北京、天津、上海、武汉等各大城市和西北、华东、中南等部分地区，人民法院抽集人力，清理积案，也获得不少成绩。北京市人民法院今年五月二十日至六月二十二日的清案期间，从市府各机关抽调干部与大学生二百余人参加工作，如期清结积案四千三百二十八件。武汉市人民法院在五月份清理积案工作中，组织积案清理委员会，调派干部和学生百余人，按照行政区划分为八个工作组，深入各区，清理积案，也解决了不少问题。上海市人民法院于今年三月进行改组，将原有的调委会撤销，于审委会下设刑民两庭。由于人力的加强，以及法院工作人员积极性的提高，刑民两庭结案效率均有显著提高。各地法院如能积极主动地多想办法，一定还会创造出更多的经验。
