　　I Chose Peace
    John Peet
    As is well known, John Peet (former Reuters Berlin Bureau Chief) issued a public statement in mid-June of this year, in which he emphasized: “As a Western journalist, I have involuntarily and unwillingly become a tool of the American-controlled war machine. As a British patriot, a democrat, and a friend of peace, I can no longer continue down this path.” According to Peet, the “lies and war-mongering” in the bourgeois newspapers' reports about the Berlin youth fighters striving for peace preparing for demonstrations could no longer be tolerated.
    John Peet severed ties with the warmongers and joined the camp of peace and progress; he began actively fighting to consolidate the peace camp. Now, at his request, the German Democratic Republic has granted him residency, and he is giving speeches in various German cities exposing the aggressive plans of the Anglo-American reactionaries. The articles by John Peet published here, in themselves, are not only the documents of a sincere man, but also truthfully and eloquently expose the characteristics of those bourgeois newspapers that manufacture lies and slander advocates of peace.
    John Peet uses his own bitter experience to ruthlessly illustrate the "kitchen" of these newspapers, and lists some irrefutable facts, arriving at the conclusion: the defamatory "sensational things" published in these newspapers are usually written with ink made of lies, blood, and mud.
    This May, General Bourne, the British Commandant of the Berlin Sector, stated bluntly to reporters: "I consider you an important component of the occupying forces. We all have a common task, and in my opinion, you are more significant than an entire battalion."
    John Peet's article just happens to explain why he refused to continue serving as a soldier in General Bourne's "battalion" with dubious "integrity."
  ——Editor of Soviet Literature Newspaper
    I
    It is only a few steps from the western area of Berlin to the democratic area; but this road is also the road from the depths of the jungle to the open space bathed in sunshine where a new world is being built.
    I resolutely abandoned that "jungle," where a handful of people who caused the last war are ruling, and are now calculating how much profit they can make in the new war they are preparing frantically. I completed a journey of only a few kilometers, and then crossed the almost invisible border, marked only by a wooden sign saying "The Democratic District of Berlin Starts Here."
    On June 12th, I made this statement at a press conference: "I stand here because I am unwilling to serve the warmongers any longer." Since then, dozens of men and women have come up to me on the streets of Berlin because they saw my photo in the newspaper. They all came to congratulate me and wish me success in the struggle for peace.
    Here I want to explain: how could a Reuters Berlin Bureau Chief, who has been supplying fabricated propaganda materials to the American-controlled warmongers in the five years of his work in Vienna, Warsaw, and Berlin, take such action?
    First, here is my brief biography. I was born in London in 1915, when the First World War was in progress. The first impression in my memory is my father's return home. He went to prison for refusing to serve in the military, and spent more than two years in prison. When the war ended, he was released.
    My father was a journalist and a Quaker. During his trial, he declared: "As a Christian and a socialist with an international perspective, I am unable to slaughter Christian Quakers and like-minded socialists in other countries."
    Like many other children, I came from a middle-class British family and was educated at a humble vocational school. I became interested in European political life precisely when the fascists seized power. After graduating from school, I worked for a period in the editorial department of a small newspaper in London. In 1935, I decided to learn more about Europe.
    Initially, I moved to Vienna, and later to Prague, where I began working as a journalist and teaching English. In these cities, I couldn't help but meet some people who had been forced to flee their own countries, and then I understood that fascism meant war, the very thing that my parents and teachers had taught me to hate.
    I could not be satisfied with verbal protests against war and fascism, so I went to Spain with thousands of other progressive-minded people from Britain, France, Germany, the United States, and other countries. The real possibility of the struggle against war and fascism had already emerged in Spain at that time.
    In the International Brigades in Spain, I understood what a powerful weapon international solidarity is for progress and peace. At the same time, I actually believed there what a fabricating ability the reactionary newspapers possess.
    A famous British journalist – a reporter for the London *Morning Post* – told me that on November 7, 1936, the day the fascist troops were supposed to occupy Madrid according to Franco's boasting declaration, he telegraphed the *Morning Post* editorial department to report on the battle situation.
    He reported: "Madrid is not only still holding firm, but the International Brigades have launched a counter-offensive."
    Before he could finish speaking, the editor-in-chief of the *Morning Post* interjected, asking: "Why are you telling me this nonsense? General Franco said in the communiqué that Madrid has been occupied."
    The reporter retorted: "But I am speaking to you from the center of Madrid; the city is still in the hands of the Republican army."
    Then the editor-in-chief replied: "Nonsense! You are a communist!"
    The day after this conversation, the *Morning Post* published a piece of news about the fall of Madrid.
    This was the first time I knew about the unrestrained lies of the bourgeois newspapers. Later, when I worked as a Reuters reporter, I encountered similar lies more than once.
    Two years later, Madrid fell as a result of the sabotage by the British, French, and American governments, so I returned to Britain.
    At that time, I couldn't find a job no matter what – should I have to return to Spain? – I had to go to Palestine, where I worked for a British administrative agency. I worked there as the editor of the Jewish radio station *Latest News* until the year the war ended.
    After the war, I returned to London and began working at Reuters. At that time, I thought that the news agency where I was working as a journalist was honest and objective, and that I could make some contributions to the cause of spreading the truth to the people, thereby promoting the construction of a new and better world.
    Because I understood some German, I was sent to Vienna to be a reporter. My first impression of the Western powers' occupation authorities was extremely cruel. At that time, the residents of Vienna, who were in a state of starvation, were doing everything they could to continue their lives, while the British, French, and American officers, along with some journalists, indulged in unprecedented banquets and debauchery.
    During the occupation period – 1945 – there were still some progressive-minded people in the Western occupation authorities who genuinely wanted to cooperate with their Soviet counterparts and do their best to prevent a new world war in practical action. The number of these people was originally small, and as a result of the occupying authorities' strict suppression of well-known advocates of peace and progress, their ranks became increasingly thin.
    The atmosphere of overall corruption could not but affect some journalists, although some of them came to Europe with the same thoughts and hopes as me.
    Some special correspondents knew that the editorial department would arbitrarily delete and revise their manuscripts until the meaning was completely contrary to the original, so they complained and gave up their work and returned to Britain.
    However, other journalists who led nomadic lives always sat in their clubs, using drinking to pass the time. They collected ready-made news from the British and American military administration's press offices, or obtained so-called "news" from some suspicious "barons" and "baronesses" who frequently entered and exited the British Press Club (where they were guaranteed to be well-treated), and sent it to their newspapers.
    Any journalist who tried to interview the necessary news in a proper way and was unwilling to pick up materials from official organs and Vienna's reactionary newspapers was considered either eccentric or crazy. Those colleagues who lived a truly colonial lifestyle, were out of touch with the outside world, and indulged in intoxication soon gave me a nickname, calling me "Austrian Peet". Because I often didn't wear a military journalist uniform, but only wore ordinary casual clothes, and chatted with the locals.
  II
    In the first year after the war, when I was working as a Reuters reporter in Vienna, I felt that my work seemed to be able to contribute to the cause of peace and progress. At that time, the American "Cold War" policy was not as sharp as it is now, and some newspapers in Western European countries could sometimes publish some truths or were prepared to do so.
    Now that I have openly joined the peace camp, I have only now realized that the idea that I could do some useful work before was purely self-deception.
    Reuters news is supplied to 5,000 kinds of newspapers in the continents of the world. If some progressive views were expressed in one of my dispatches, then only ten, twenty, or thirty kinds of newspapers would publish it in a prominent position, and the rest of the newspapers would definitely try to hide it in the most inconspicuous corner, or simply not publish it at all.
    But if I, this "honest" and "objective" journalist, reported the kind of ordinary reactionary news contained in the British official gazette or the Americanized part of the Vienna newspapers, then my report would be praised by hundreds or even thousands of newspapers and published on the front page.
    In 1945 and 1946, in the atmosphere of decadence, arrogance, and binge-drinking that enveloped western Vienna, many of my colleagues began to lose the last bit of conscience, if they had any conscience. Many people were so excessively indulging in alcoholism and entertainment that they could not engage in any work, but only relayed the extremely distorted reports published by the American press offices. One of my colleagues, who was once confused by strong alcohol, sent a dispatch to his newspaper, which could probably be regarded as a record-breaking "inaccurate" dispatch in the history of journalism of all periods.
    In this dispatch about an international football match held in Vienna, he randomly wrote four errors; first, the names of the teams and the countries they represented were mistaken; second, he wrote the result of the final wrong; third, this was clearly a football match, but he reported it as a "Rugby-style football match"; fourth, even stranger, he said that the match was held in Budapest.
    If he could make such a fantastical error report about an ordinary football match, then it is conceivable what kind of analysis this journalist would make of the political and economic situation in Austria or neighboring countries.
    In December 1946, Reuters sent me to Warsaw. Warsaw had been brutally destroyed by fascist Germany, and at that time, preparations for its restoration had just begun. The lives of the British and American diplomats and journalists living in Warsaw were even more debauched than in Vienna. Many British journalists came to participate in the elections that were taking place at that time. The journalists went to the British Embassy to inquire about secret news about the country. They were sent to Mikolajczyk (Note 1). The staff of the British Embassy said: "This is our man," and then added: "He can provide you with all the important news."
    At a press conference convened by Mikolajczyk, an American photographer brilliantly demonstrated the general cultural level of American journalists. He walked around the room, stood on a chair several times in order to find a good "viewpoint", and suddenly lowered his voice and said: "Please tell me, which one is Pilsudski (Note 2)?"
    The reactionary gangs of armed Polish terrorists maintained close contact with the British and American embassies in Warsaw and made contact with the journalists through the embassies. One morning, a suspicious guy came to my residence. He said that he knew my address from "one of our British friends." He expressed his willingness to provide me with accurate news about the activities of the "Ukrainian rebels" for my disposal. According to him, the activities of the rebels were imagined by him.
    When I pushed him out of the house, the guy was surprised.
    "What's going on," he muttered, "they told me that you work at Reuters—the official British news agency. The British are fighting against the Reds, against the Russians. Then, you should also like..."
    The cooperation between murderers and terrorists—whom Western friends call "patriots"—and the Western embassies in Poland was so close at that time that even British Ambassador Sir Bannister personally participated. As a result, this ambassador had to leave Poland after a person who provided him with intelligence was handed over to the court for espionage. (Junqiang, Liu Jing translated) (To be continued)

### 我选择了和平

　　我选择了和平
    约翰·皮特
    如所周知，约翰·皮特（曾任路透社驻柏林采访主任）于今年六月中旬发表了公开声明，其中强调指出：“作为一个西方的新闻记者，我不由自主而且于心不甘地变成了美国所控制的战争机构的工具。作为一个英国的爱国者，民主分子与和平的友人，我不能再继续走这条路了”。据皮特说，资产阶级报纸上关于柏林争取和平的青年战士准备示威游行报道中的“谎言和煽动战争狂”，已使他再不能忍耐下去了。
    约翰·皮特断绝了与战争贩子们的关系，参加了和平的与进步的阵营；他为要巩固和平阵营，开始积极的战斗。现在，由于他的请求，德意志民主共和国给与他居住权，他正在德国各城市作着暴露英美反动派的侵略计划的讲演。现在刊载着的约翰·皮特的这些文章，就文章本身来说，不仅是一个真挚的人的文献，同时又真实而雄辩地暴露了那些制造谎言和诋毁和平拥护者的资产阶级报纸的特性。
    约翰·皮特用了自己的辛酸经验无情地说明这些报纸的“厨房”，并列举一些无可反驳的事实，得出一个结论：这些报纸中所刊载的诽谤的“耸人听闻的事物”通常是用谎言、鲜血和污泥所作成的墨水写出的。
    今年五月，柏林英区司令长官鲍尔恩将军曾经直言不讳地对记者声明：“我认为你们是占领军重要的成分。我们全都有一个共同的任务，在我看来你们比整整的一营更具有意义”。
    约翰·皮特的文章正好说明：为什么他拒绝再继续以可疑的“正直”充当鲍尔恩将军的“营”中的兵卒了。
  ——苏联文学报编者
    一
    从柏林西部区域到民主区域只有几步路；但这路也就是从林莽深处通到阳光普照的正在建造新世界的旷地的路。
    我坚决离弃了那“林莽”，统治着那儿的一撮人们曾经造成了上次大战，而现在正计算着在自己疯狂地准备着的新战争中间可赚多少的利润。我完毕了只不过几公里的路程，于是穿过只有写着“柏林民主区从这里开始”的木牌做标志的几乎看不出的边界去。
    六月十二日我在记者招待会上作了这样的声明：“我站在这个地方，因为我不愿意再为战争贩子服务了。”从此以后，——在柏林大街上，就有几十个男的和女的走过来招呼我，因为他们在报纸上看到了我的照片。他们都来祝贺我，希望我在争取和平的斗争中获得成功。
    我在这里想要解释一下：一个路透社柏林采访主任，在维也纳·华沙和柏林的五年工作过程中间，是曾经把捏造出来的宣传材料供给过在美国人支配下的战争贩子们的，现在他采取这样的行动了，这是怎么一回事呢？
    首先，是我简短的小传。一九一五年我生于伦敦，当时第一次世界大战正在进行。在我的记忆中，第一个印象就是我父亲的回家。他因拒绝服兵役的缘故，进了监狱，过了两年多的监狱生活。当战争结束的时候，他获得释放了。
    我的父亲作过新闻记者，又是教友派教徒。他在受审期间宣称：“作为一个基督教徒和一个具有国际眼光的社会主义者，我没有能力去屠杀其他国家的基督教教友和志同道合的社会主义者”。
    正像许多其他孩子们一样，我出身于英国中间阶层的家庭，曾在一个简陋的专科学校里受过教育。恰当法西斯掌握政权的时候，我对欧洲的政治生活开始发生了兴趣。从学校毕业后，我在伦敦一个不大的报纸的编辑部工作了一个时期，一九三五年，我决定要更进一步了解欧洲。
    最初，我移居维也纳，后来转到布拉格，在布拉格我开始作记者，并教英文。在这些城市中，我不由得遇见了一些从自己祖国被迫逃出的人们，于是我明白：法西斯主义意味着战争，即我的父母和教师们教我憎恨的东西。
    我不能满足于对战争和法西斯主义的字面抗议，因此我连同英、法、德、美及其他国家的几千个具有进步思想的人们到西班牙去，反战反法西斯的斗争的真正可能性当时已经在西班牙出现了。
    在西班牙的国际纵队中，我明白：国际团结是进步与和平的怎样一个强有力的武器。同时我在那里，从实际上相信：反动报纸具有怎样一种捏造的才能。
    一个出名的英国新闻记者——伦敦《晨邮报》记者——对我说过，一九三六年十一月七日，就是这一天，按照佛朗哥所吹嘘的宣言，法西斯军队是应当进占马德里的，他为了给晨邮报编辑部报道战况拍去了电报。
    他报道说：“马德里不仅还固守着，而且国际纵队转入了反攻”。
    他来不及说完这句话，《晨邮报》总编辑就插进话来，问道：“你把这些胡话告诉我干么？在公报上佛朗哥将军说，马德里已被占领了”。
    这位记者反驳道：“但是，我是在马德里中心区对你说话呢；城市仍然在共和军的手里。”
    接着总编辑回答说：“胡说！你是一个共产党！”
    在这番谈话后的第二天，《晨邮报》上刊载了一段关于马德里陷落的消息。
    这就是我第一次知道了资产阶级报纸上毫无约制的谎言。后来，我作了路透社记者的时候，不止一次地碰到了类似这样的谎言。
    过了两年，英国、法国和美国政府方面怠工的结果使马德里陷落了，于是我回到了英国。
    当时我无论如何也不能找到工作——难道我还得回西班牙去吗？——我不得不到巴勒斯坦去，我就在那里的一个不列颠行政机关供职。我在那里充当犹太电台《最后消息》的编辑，工作到战争终止那一年。
    战争结束后，我回到伦敦，于是开始在路透社工作。当时我原以为我担任着记者的这一通讯社是正直的、客观的，我能够在向人民传播真理的事业中，有一些供献，从而促进建设新的，更好的世界。
    因为我懂得一些德国话，就被派到维也纳去做记者。对西方列强占领当局的第一个印象就是非常的残酷。当时处于饥饿状态的维也纳居民，正在尽一切力量来延续自己的生活，而英国、法国和美国的军官，连同一些记者却耽溺于空前未有的酒宴和放荡行为。
    在占领期中——一九四五年——西方占领当局的机关中还有一些思想进步的人们，真正要与苏维埃同业和协，并在实际行动上尽力防止新的世界战争。这些人为数本来不多，由于占领当局严密取缔人所共知的和平与进步的拥护者们的结果，他们的行列也就愈来愈单薄了。
    全面腐化的气氛不能不影响一些记者，虽然其中一部分人来到欧洲是怀有和我同样的思想与希望的。
    有些特派记者知道编辑部一定要把自己写去的稿件胡乱删改一通，直到改得意义和原来完全相反，于是心里抱怨，把工作放弃回到英国去。
    但是，另外一些过着游荡生活的记者，却老是坐在自己的俱乐部里，用喝酒来消磨时间，他们从英军和美军管理的新闻处搜集些现成消息，或是从经常在不列颠新闻俱乐部（在这里，他们是保证可以受到很好的款待的）进出的形迹可疑的什么“男爵”和“男爵夫人”那儿获得一些所谓“消息”，发送到自己的报纸去。
    凡是用正当方法尽力想采访必要消息，而不愿从官方机关和维也纳反动报纸上摭拾什么材料的记者，都被认为不是有怪癖就是疯子。那些过着真正殖民地化的生活方式，和外界不通声气，而一味耽溺于沉醉中间的同业们，很快就给了我一个绰号，叫“奥地利人皮特”。因为，我是常常不穿军事记者制服，只穿普通便服，和当地人攀谈的。
  二
    战争结束后的第一年，当我做着路透社驻维也纳记者的时候，我觉得我的工作似乎也能够有助于和平与进步的事业。那时美国的“冷战”方针还不像现在这样尖锐，同时西欧国家一些报纸有时还能够发表些真象或是准备这样。
    现在，我公开地加入了和平阵营之后，我方才明白，先前以为自己可以作些有益的工作那一种想法，纯粹是自己欺骗自己。
    路透社的消息是供给世界各洲五千种报纸的。如果我的某篇通讯中表示了一些进步观点，那么就只有十种、二十种或三十种报纸会把它刊登在显著地位，其余的报纸一定设法把它隐藏在使人最不注意的角落，或者干脆不登。
    但是如果我这个“诚实的”“客观的”记者，报道了那一种包含在不列颠官方公报或维也纳报纸的美国化部分中间的普通的反动消息，那么我的报道就会受到成百种甚至成千种报纸的赞扬，而被刊登在第一版了。
    一九四五年至四六年，在笼罩着维也纳西部的堕落、傲慢和狂饮的气氛中间，我的许多同业开始丧失了最后的一点良心，如果他们还有良心的话。许多人过分耽溺于酗酒和娱乐，以至不能从事什么工作，只不过转达一些美国新闻处所发表的那些异常歪曲的报道而已。我的同业中的一个，他有一次被烈性酒醉得神智不清了，就给他的报纸寄去了一篇通讯，这通讯大概可以算得各个时期的新闻史上破纪录的“不确实的”通讯了。
    在这一篇关于维也纳举行国际足球比赛的通讯中，他胡乱地写错了四处；第一、各队队名及其所代表的国家弄错了；第二、他把决赛的结果写错了；第三、这明明是足球比赛，他却报道为“勒格比式球赛”；第四、更怪了，他说这比赛是在布达佩斯举行的。
    如果他对于一个普通的足球比赛，做得出这么一种幻想的错误报道，那么这位记者对于奥地利或邻近各国的政治经济情势，会作怎样的分析，也就可想而知了。
    一九四六年十二月，路透社派我到华沙去。华沙遭受了法西斯德国的残酷破坏，当时，刚刚开始准备复兴。住在华沙的英美外交官及记者们的生活，比在维也纳的更加放荡。不列颠的记者们来了许多，为的是要参加当时正在进行的选举。记者们到英国大使馆去探听关于这个国家情况的秘密消息。他们便被送到米柯拉兹克（注一）那儿去。英国大使馆的工作人员说：“这是我们的人”，随后又补充一句：“他可以供给你们一切紧要的消息。”
    在米柯拉兹克所召集的一次记者招待会上，一个美国摄影记者出色地表现出美国新闻工作者的一般文化水平来。他绕着屋子走了一圈，为了要找好的“观点”，好几次站到椅子上去，忽然他压低了桑音说：“请告诉我，这中间哪一位是毕苏斯基（注二）？”
    波兰恐怖分子武装的反动匪帮，与英美在华沙的使馆保有密切的接触便通过了使馆与记者们发生联系。一天早晨，一个可疑的家伙来到了我的住处。他说是从“我们的一位英国朋友处”知道我的地址的。他表示准备供给我关于“乌克兰叛军”活动的确实消息，听候我的处理。据他说，关于叛军的活动，是他想像出来的。
    当我把他推出屋外去的时候，这个家伙惊讶不已。
    “这是怎么回事呢”，他喃喃地说：“他们告诉我，说您在路透社工作——英国官方的通讯社。英国人进行着反对赤色、反对俄国人的斗争。那么，您也应该喜欢……”
    凶手和恐怖主义者——西方的朋友们称他们为“爱国之士”——与西方各国在波兰的使馆的合作，当时是如此密切，甚至英国大使班定克先生都亲自参加。结果是，这位大使先生在一个供给他情报的人因间谍案被交付法庭之后，他不得不离开了波兰。（君强、刘竞合译）（未完）
