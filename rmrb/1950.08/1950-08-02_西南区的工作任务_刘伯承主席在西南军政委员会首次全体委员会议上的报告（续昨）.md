　　Eighth, Strictly prohibit opium cultivation, severely punish opium traffickers, and eliminate opium addiction.

　　The extent of opium cultivation and the number of opium addicts in the Southwest region are the highest in the country. This is the result of the criminal rule of feudal warlords, comprador bureaucrats, and local tyrants and evil gentry. This year, the Southwest provinces harvested no less than 60 to 70 million taels of raw opium. If it is allowed to be sold domestically, the harm to production and social order is unimaginable. The People's Government must take strict measures to solve this serious social problem. First, it must resolutely prohibit planting. After the promulgation of the prohibition decree, those who neglect the law and continue to plant will be severely punished according to law. A strict ban on the transportation and sale of opium and the opening of opium dens must be clearly ordered. The owners of opium dens and opium traffickers who are caught should be severely punished, even sentenced to death. For opium addicts, they should be persuaded to quit under the supervision of the people. The Military and Political Committee should draft special laws for this purpose and promulgate them for implementation.

　　A movement to eradicate opium addiction should be launched throughout the region. Each county should set up special anti-smoking institutions, and people's representative conferences in each county and city should hold special discussions to cooperate with the implementation of the People's Government's decrees.

　　Ninth, cultural and educational work.

　　The Common Program stipulates that "the cultural and educational work of the People's Government should take raising the cultural level of the people, cultivating talents for national construction, eliminating feudal, comprador, and fascist ideas, and developing ideas that serve the people as its main tasks," and the provisions of other articles in Chapter 5 of the Common Program are the general guidelines for carrying out cultural and educational work in the Southwest region. The report by Guo Moruo, Director of the Cultural and Educational Committee, at the Second Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference should be the guide for recent cultural and educational work.

　　After the liberation of the Southwest, a widespread political study movement was launched and achieved good results. This work must be strengthened to transform old ideas and establish the idea of serving the people. Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges should be organized to consolidate the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, and education combining patriotism and internationalism should be strengthened in connection with current affairs materials.

　　In the past few months, the focus of school education work has been on carrying out some preliminary reforms on the basis of maintenance. In the future, we should follow the plan of the Central Ministry of Education, draw on the experience of advanced regions, and further reform the old education system in a planned and step-by-step manner, and integrate the education plan with the needs of national construction. All localities should concentrate their efforts on running several schools well, accumulate experience, and demonstrate to others. Special plans must be made for the training and selection of teachers, and they must be carried out carefully. Unqualified schools should be transformed or merged. For private schools, a policy of resolutely maintaining, focusing on assistance, and gradually reforming should be adopted under the principle of taking into account both public and private interests. The tendency of some teachers and students to misunderstand "liberation" and "freedom" and abandon management or learning responsibilities should be corrected.

　　A national, scientific, and mass cultural and educational popularization movement should be launched, and spare-time schools for workers, youth, and women should be established. In particular, labor people's cultural palaces should be established in areas where workers are concentrated to strengthen the cultural and educational work of workers. A large number of educated youth in the countryside should be mobilized to participate in rural cultural and educational work and promote the rural social reform movement.

　　Literature and art should be promoted, excellent creations should be rewarded, scientific works and inventions should be rewarded, and the news and publishing industry should be strengthened. Cultural relics and historical sites should be protected and not destroyed.

　　The development of health care should be promoted, and people in various places should be guided to carry out epidemic prevention and health campaigns, and attention should be paid to protecting the health of pregnant women and infants. The unity of Chinese and Western medical circles should be strengthened, their political study should be strengthened, and the idea of serving the people should be established.

　　For unemployed intellectuals, they should be gradually helped to transform and obtain employment opportunities according to the state's financial capacity and work needs. The People's Revolutionary University should strengthen its work in this area. Intellectuals who are willing to move forward should actively participate in the rural rent reduction and anti-hegemony and anti-feudal social reform movement to transform their thinking and prepare for participating in national construction.

　　Tenth, work on ethnic minorities.

　　The Southwest is a multi-ethnic region. It is necessary to implement the correct ethnic policy in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Common Program, oppose Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism, in order to closely unite the strength of all ethnic groups, establish a solid national defense, eliminate bandits and special agents, build a new Southwest, and enable the masses of people of all ethnic minorities to develop political, economic, cultural, and educational construction undertakings.

　　In politics, the principle of equality, unity, and mutual assistance should be followed, and ethnic regional autonomy should be implemented in areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities. In the people's representative conferences and political organs of provinces, cities, and counties where various ethnic groups live together, each ethnic group should have a corresponding number of representatives and staff members. Disputes between ethnic groups should be resolved through consultation between the people of each ethnic group or through mediation by the government in accordance with the policies of the Common Program. Discrimination, oppression, and acts that split the unity of ethnic groups are prohibited.

　　In economics, the People's Government should promote the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, industry, and commerce in minority areas and improve the people's lives through free trade, equal value exchange, organization of transportation, organization of cooperatives, undertaking necessary and possible social welfare undertakings, and other methods.

　　In terms of culture and education, the People's Government should help all ethnic minorities develop their own languages and scripts and school education, protect their freedom of religious belief, respect their customs and habits, and help them develop medical and health work. The People's Government should run cadre schools and cadre training classes for all ethnic minorities to train a large number of minority cadres.

　　All reforms concerning the political, economic, and social affairs of various ethnic groups must be based on the conditions of each ethnic group itself, and must be decided and implemented by the people of each ethnic group consciously and voluntarily. Work cadres must not make decisions and implement them forcibly. The land laws, rent reduction laws, etc. implemented in Han areas are not applicable to minority areas. Financial systems such as the collection of public grain and taxes must also be adapted to the actual situation in minority areas and should not be mechanically applied.

　　Eleventh, strengthen cadre study and improve cadre style.

　　Among the more than 100,000 local work cadres in the Southwest, only about 30,000 are from the old liberated areas, transferred from the army, and underground party cadres, accounting for about one-sixth of the total number of cadres, which is the backbone of the Southwest's work. About 50% are retained old personnel, and the rest are young students who have newly joined the work. Some worker and peasant activists have also begun to be absorbed, but the number is still small.

　　The tasks in the past six months have been difficult and arduous. Under the leadership of the 30,000 old cadres, the vast majority of cadres have worked hard and achieved results. However, in the work, many cadres have also made mistakes of bureaucratism, especially commandism. If they are not corrected, they will be greatly separated from the masses, making it impossible to implement policies well and complete work tasks well. We are conducting a comprehensive rectification movement, and the main target of the rectification is these 30,000 backbones. Because the vast majority of cadres have infinite loyalty to the cause of the people's revolution, their shortcomings can be overcome and their work will be done better after the rectification.

　　For a large number of retained personnel, attention should be paid to strengthening their study and transformation, changing their old ideas and old styles, and establishing their ideas and styles of serving the people. This is a very arduous task, and it is also a very important task because the proportion of retained personnel is very large among the existing cadres. For young cadres, their enthusiasm for work should be valued, and they should be educated to learn how to master policies and correct working methods.

　　Cultivating and selecting a large number of worker and peasant cadres is an important task of cadre work in the future. Because only in this way can we contact the broadest masses and make revolutionary work take root firmly among the broad masses.

　　Twelfth, establish a system of people's representative conferences at all levels and consolidate the united front of the great unity of the people.

　　The entire Southwest region must conscientiously establish a system of people's representative conferences at all levels to expand unity and consolidate the people's political power. All counties and cities that have established people's representative conferences and peasant representative conferences must fix the regular holding of such conferences as a system to be implemented on time. Counties and cities that have not yet established them must convene them quickly and must not delay any longer. All provinces and regions should also prepare to convene people's representative conferences in provinces and regions. In the coming year, provincial (regional) level meetings must be held twice, and each county and city must hold three to four meetings each year. In people's representative conferences at all levels, consultation committees should be elected, and when conditions permit, they should exercise the functions and powers of people's congresses and elect people's governments at all levels. At the district and township levels, peasant representative conferences should be held earnestly and universally, and the Baojia system should be abolished in due course. The village people's government should be elected by the peasant representative conference.

　　In the coming year, the majority of the people, especially the basic masses such as workers, peasants, and other laborers, women, and youth, must be organized. Trade unions, peasant associations, youth, women, and cultural groups must be improved and expanded to expand the mass base of the people's democratic political power.

　　The establishment of the Southwest Military and Political Committee has made the united front of the people's democracy in the Southwest region more solid. The task in the future is to strengthen the unity of the working class, the peasant class, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie, ethnic minorities, overseas Chinese, and other patriotic elements, and steadily build a new Southwest. Our Southwest Military and Political Committee itself should cooperate closely with each other, adopt an open and sincere attitude in case of trouble, use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism and the method of joint consultation, and solve it carefully. Every resolution and every measure we take will affect the welfare of the broad masses of the people, and we should make our efforts not fail the expectations of the people of the Southwest.

　　Our current tasks are arduous and there are many difficulties, but we have the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the Common Program to follow, and rely on our unity and the efforts of the vast number of lower-level cadres. All difficulties can be overcome and all difficult work tasks can be completed. As Chairman Mao said, "All our people's undertakings are developing along a new track, and progress and achievements can be seen every day. No difficulties can prevent the advance of the people's undertakings."

　　西南区的工作任务
    刘伯承主席在西南军政委员会首次全体委员会议上的报告（续昨）
    第八、禁种鸦片，严办烟贩，禁绝烟毒。
    西南鸦片种植之广，人民吸毒之多，为全国冠。这是封建军阀、官僚买办、土豪劣绅的罪恶统治的结果。今年西南各省收割的烟土不下六、七千万两，如任其内销，其危害生产与社会秩序之大，是难以想像的。对于这个严重的社会问题，人民政府必须采取严格办法加以解决。首先必须做到坚决的禁种，在禁种法令公布之后，如有玩忽法令继续种植者，依法严办。要明令严禁鸦片运销，严禁开设烟馆，对于查获之烟馆主人和烟贩应一律严办，直至判处死刑。对于吸毒分子，应在人民监督之下，劝令其戒除。军政委员会对此应草拟专门法令，公布施行。
    全区应展开一个禁绝烟毒运动，各县应设置专门的戒烟机构，各县市人民代表会议应作专题讨论，以配合人民政府法令之执行。
    第九、文化教育工作。
    共同纲领规定的“人民政府的文化教育工作，应以提高人民文化水平，培养国家建设人材，肃清封建的、买办的、法西斯主义的思想，发展为人民服务的思想为主要任务”，以及共同纲领第五章其他各条的规定，即为西南区进行文化教育工作的总方针。文化教育委员会郭沫若主任在人民政协委员会第二次会议上的报告，应为最近文教工作的指南。
    西南解放后，曾展开普遍的政治学习运动，获得了良好成绩。此项工作仍须加强，以改造旧思想，树立为人民服务的思想。应组织中苏文化交流，巩固中苏人民之间的友谊，并应联系时事材料，加强爱国主义与国际主义相结合的教育。
    几个月来学校教育工作的重点，是在维持的基础上进行了一些初步的改革。今后则应遵照中央教育部计划，吸取先进各区的经验，有计划有步骤地将旧的教育制度加以进一步的改革，并使教育计划与国家建设的需要相结合。各地应集中力量办好几个学校，积累经验，示范其他。对于师资的训练和选择，尤须订出计划，审慎进行。对于不合格的学校，应予改造或加以合并。对私立学校，应在公私兼顾的原则下，采取坚决维持、重点扶助与逐渐改革的方针。对于一部分教员学生误解“解放”、误解“自由”，放弃管理或放弃学习责任的倾向，应予纠正。
    应开展民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育普及运动，开办职工、青年、妇女业余学校，特别要在工人集中地区，建立劳动人民文化宫，以加强工人的文化教育工作。应动员大批在乡知识青年，参加农村文化教育工作和推动农村社会改革运动。
    应提倡文学艺术，奖励优秀创作，奖励科学著作与发明，加强新闻出版事业。应保护文物古迹，不得破坏。
    应推广卫生保健事业，指导各地人民进行防疫卫生运动，并注意保护产妇婴儿的健康。应加强中西医界的团结，加强他们的政治学习，树立为人民服务的思想。
    对于失业的知识分子，应按国家财政能力和工作需要，逐渐的帮助他们改造和获得就业的机会，人民革命大学在这一方面应加强自己的工作。愿意前进的知识分子，应积极参加农村减租反霸和反封建的社会改革运动，使自己的思想获得改造，为参加国家建设事业作好准备。
    第十、少数民族工作。
    西南是一个多民族地区，必须依据共同纲领第六章的各条规定，执行正确的民族政策，反对大汉族主义和狭隘民族主义，以便亲密团结各民族的力量，建立巩固的国防，肃清土匪特务，建设新西南，并使各少数民族的人民大众，获得政治、经济、文化、教育的建设事业之发展。
    在政治上，应本平等团结互助原则，在少数民族聚居地区，实行民族区域自治。在各民族杂居地区之省、市、县人民代表会议和政权机关内，各民族均应有其相当名额的代表和工作人员。各民族间的纠纷，应本共同纲领的政策，经过各民族人民协商或由政府调处解决之。禁止民族间的歧视、压迫和分裂各民族团结的行为。
    在经济上，人民政府应经过实行贸易自由，等价交换，组织运输，组织合作社，举办必要与可能的社会福利事业以及其他方法，扶助少数民族区域的农、牧、工商各业之发展，改善人民的生活。
    在文化教育方面，人民政府应帮助各少数民族发展本民族的语言文字和学校教育，保障其宗教信仰自由，尊重其风俗习惯，并帮助其发展医药卫生工作。人民政府应举办各少数民族的干部学校和干部训练班，培养大批的少数民族干部。
    有关各民族的政治的、经济的、社会的各项改革事宜，必需依据于各该民族自身的条件，并在各族人民自觉自愿的基础上，由各族人民自行决定和实行，不得由工作干部自行决定和强制地加以实行。现在汉人地区实行的土地法令减租法令等，不适用于少数民族地区。征收公粮、税收等项财政制度，在少数民族地区亦须针对实际情况酌情变通，不宜机械搬用。
    第十一、加强干部学习，改进干部作风。
    现在西南十余万地方工作干部中，由老解放区来的和由军队中调出的，加上地下党的干部共计不过三万，约占干部总数的六分之一左右，这是西南工作的骨干。而百分之五十左右为留用的旧人员，其余则为新参加工作的青年学生；也开始吸收了一些工农积极分子，但为数尚少。
    半年来的工作任务是艰难而繁重的，在三万老干部的率领下，绝大多数干部是努力的，工作是有成绩的。但是在工作中，不少干部也犯了官僚主义特别是命令主义的错误，如不纠正，将大大地脱离群众，使政策不能很好贯彻，工作任务不能很好完成。我们正在进行全面的整风运动，整风对象主要就是这三万骨干。由于绝大多数干部对于人民革命事业具有无限的忠诚，经过整风之后，他们的缺点是能够克服的，工作是会做得更好的。
    对于大批留用人员，应注意加强他们的学习和改造，改变其旧思想旧作风，确立其为人民服务的思想和作风。这是一个非常艰巨的工作，正因为留用人员占现有干部的比重很大，所以又是非常重要的工作。对于青年干部，则应宝贵他们的工作热情，教育他们学会掌握政策和正确的工作方法。
    大量培养与选拔工农干部，是今后干部工作的重要任务。因为只有这样，我们才能联系最广大的群众，也才能使革命工作在广大群众中扎下坚固的根基。
    第十二、建立各级人民代表会议制度，巩固人民大团结的统一战线。
    西南全区必须认真地建立各级人民代表会议制度，以扩大团结，巩固人民政权。各县市凡已建立各界人民代表会议及农民代表会议者，必须把定期召开此种会议，固定成为按时执行的制度。其尚未建立的县市，必须迅速召开，不得再事拖延。各省区亦应准备召开省区的各界人民代表会议。今后一年内，省（区）级须召开两次，各县各市每年须召开三至四次。在各级人民代表会议中，应选举协商委员会，并于条件允许时，代行人民代表大会职权，选举各级人民政府。区乡两级则应认真普遍地召开农民代表会议，适时废除保甲制度。由农民代表会议选举乡村人民政府。
    在今后一年内，必须把人民群众的大多数，尤其是工人、农民及其他劳动者与妇女、青年等基本群众组织起来，必须健全与扩大工会、农民协会及青年、妇女、文化团体，以扩大人民民主政权的群众基础。
    西南军政委员会的成立，使西南区人民民主的统一战线更加坚固起来。今后的任务是加强工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级、少数民族、海外华侨及其他爱国分子的团结，稳步地建设新西南。我们西南军政委员会本身，尤应互相亲密合作，遇事采取坦白诚挚的态度，运用批评和自我批评的武器和共同协商的方法，审慎地加以解决。我们的每一次决议和每一措施，都将影响到广大人民的福利，我们应使自己的努力不致辜负西南人民的期望。
    我们当前的任务是繁重的，困难是很多的，但是我们有毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导，有共同纲领可资遵循，依靠我们的团结和广大下层干部的努力，一切困难都是可以克服的，一切繁难的工作任务都是可以完成的。正如毛主席所说，“我们的一切人民事业均正在循着新的轨道向前发展，每天都可看见进步，看见成绩，任何困难都不能阻止人民事业的前进”。
