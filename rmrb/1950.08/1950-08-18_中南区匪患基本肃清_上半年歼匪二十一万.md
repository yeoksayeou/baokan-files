Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 14th: The People's Liberation Army of the Central and Southern Military Region eliminated 210,000 bandits in the first half of this year (six months). Now, the bandit troubles in most areas of the six provinces of Central and South China have been basically eliminated. Since the elimination of bandits in Henan Province and most areas of Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan at the end of last year, further suppression over the past six months has basically eliminated the bandit troubles in Jiangxi. In Hubei, except for small groups of bandits in some marginal areas in the northwest and southwest, there are no traces of bandits in most areas. In southern Hunan, where bandit troubles have persisted for decades, the situation has now been basically clarified. Since June, no robberies have occurred in the entire area. Yuanling, Guzhang, and other eight counties in the heart of western Hunan, a historically notorious bandit area in the country, have now basically eliminated bandits. Zhang Ping, commander of the Bandit Temporary 11th Division, who was deeply hated by the people of western Hunan, has been killed. Chen Zixian, commander of the Bandit Temporary 2nd Army, Chen Cecong, commander of the Temporary 2nd Division, Li Lanchu, deputy commander of the Temporary 4th Division, and other important bandit leaders have been captured and brought to justice. In Guangdong, except for small groups of bandits still lurking in the remote mountainous areas, the bandits in the heartland have been basically eliminated. Among them, scattered bandits in the Chaoshan, Xingmei, Dongjiang, and Xijiang areas have also been basically eliminated. Lu Hong, commander of the "China Democratic Self-Salvation Third Column," who had plagued the Xijiang area for 20 years, has been captured. Liu Guixin, commander of the 12th Division of the "China People's Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," who was active in the Beijiang area, has also been captured alive. Guangxi Province has also achieved significant successes in bandit suppression operations in the past six months, successively clearing important bandit lairs such as the Darong Mountains and the Liuwan Mountains, and capturing Zhu Guanghui, commander of the Bandit "Guinan Anti-Communist Youth Independent Regiment 2nd Army," sent by the Li and Bai bandit gangs to carry out rebellions, as well as important bandit leaders such as bandit Deputy Commander Li Yangwei and Deputy Division Commander Shi Ziqi. After five or six months of suppression, bandits on Hainan Island have also been basically eliminated. A total of more than 16,000 bandits were annihilated in two months.
　　The counter-revolutionary bandit armed forces in Central and South China were organized by special agents, local tyrants, die-hard personnel of the puppet regime, reactionary military officers, heads of secret societies, and habitual bandits colluding with each other. These bandits, instigated by American imperialism and the remnant bandit gangs of the Kuomintang, engaged in counter-revolutionary activities to disrupt revolutionary order and obstruct rural land reform. In January and February of this year, bandits in Guangdong and Guangxi and other places took advantage of the spring famine in some areas and the gap when the People's Liberation Army was engaged in production to carry out large-scale activities. However, under the resolute suppression and political disintegration offensive of the People's Liberation Army, the bandit troubles in most areas were quickly extinguished.

　　中南区匪患基本肃清
    上半年歼匪二十一万
    【新华社汉口十四日电】中南军区人民解放军在今年上半年（六个月）共消灭土匪达二十一万人，现中南六省大部分地区的匪患已基本肃清。自去年年底河南全省及江西、湖北、湖南大部分地区的股匪被肃清后，经过半年来的进一步清剿，江西匪患已基本肃清；湖北除西北、西南部分边沿地区尚有小股土匪外，广大地区已无匪踪。在湖南南部，数十年来匪患不绝，现已基本澄清，全区自六月份开始未发生抢案。在历史上即为全国著名匪患地区的湘西之腹心地区沅陵、古丈等八县现已在基本上肃清了土匪。为湘西人民痛恨入骨的匪暂十一师师长张平已被击毙，匪暂二军军长陈子贤、暂二师师长陈策匆、暂四师副师长李兰初等重要匪首已一一被擒正法。广东除边沿山区尚有小部股匪流窜外，腹心地区的股匪已被基本肃清。其中潮汕、兴梅、东江、西江等地区的散匪亦已基本肃清。为害西江地区达二十年的匪“中国民主自救第三纵队”司令陆轰已被捕获。活动于北江地区之匪“中国人民反共救国军”十二师师长刘桂馨亦被活捉。广西省半年来在剿匪作战中亦获重大成就，先后肃清了大容山、六万大山等重要匪巢，活捉李、白匪帮派遣来进行叛乱的匪“桂南反共青年独立团第二军”军长朱光辉及匪副总指挥李扬威、副师长石子起等重要匪首。海南岛各地股匪经五、六两月清剿，亦已基本肃清。计两个月中共歼匪一万六千余名。
    中南地区的反革命土匪武装是由特务、恶霸地主、怙恶不悛的伪政权人员和反动军官以及会门头子、惯匪互相勾结组织而成的。这些匪徒在美帝国主义与国民党残余匪帮嗾使下进行破坏革命秩序、阻扰农村土地改革的反革命活动。今年一、二月间，两广等地土匪曾利用部分地区的春荒和解放军从事生产的间隙，大肆活动。但在人民解放军坚决清剿和政治瓦解并进的攻势之下，大部分地区匪患即被迅速扑灭。
