　　Shijiazhuang People's Bank, after Reviewing Loan Work Biases, Continues to Support Private Industry and Commerce
    [Report from this newspaper, Shijiazhuang] After reviewing the biases in loan work since the unification of finance and economics, the Shijiazhuang People's Bank has continued to provide loans to support private industry and commerce since June. Currently, all branches are working on inspecting loan disbursements.
    The main task of the bank's branches from mid-March to the end of April was to implement currency withdrawal and stabilize prices. Consequently, loan disbursements were suspended, leading to tight credit and difficulties in capital turnover for private industry and commerce. In May, market prices became even more stable. To appropriately regulate cash flow and help industry and commerce recover production and overcome difficulties, the bank adopted a policy of general tightening and focused lending, supporting cotton weaving, ironworking, oil pressing, and the processing and transportation of export goods.
    After June, to further help private industry and commerce overcome difficulties and thoroughly implement the policy of benefiting both public and private sectors, all branches of the bank internally studied relevant documents and, in conjunction with their actual work, examined the biases in their past work. They determined to appropriately broaden the scope of lending under the premise of thoroughly implementing the policy of benefiting both public and private sectors, developing production, and helping industry and commerce overcome difficulties. Judging from the loan figures for May and June, the bank's lending scope was gradually expanding. For example, in May, loans were disbursed to 478 private industrial and commercial households, with an outstanding balance of over 960 million yuan. By the end of June, the lending scope had expanded to 47 industries, including ironworking, cotton weaving, oil pressing, pig bristles, and wool, totaling 946 households, with an outstanding balance of over 2.56 billion yuan. The number of households almost doubled compared to May, and the amount exceeded 1.7 times. With the help of these loans, private industry and commerce were able to recover and develop. For example, Sihuo Gong Oil Mill, Lifeng Cotton Mill, Jinyuan Iron Factory, and Jifengyu Electric Mill, whose production had almost stopped, all improved under the bank's support.
    Furthermore, the bank also educated private manufacturers to improve their business through loans. For example, in the past, the cast iron pot industry in Qiaodong resorted to unscrupulous means and cut corners in order to strive for high profits. Later, the bank, in cooperation with the Industry Bureau, not only conducted education but also signed contracts with Tongyixing, Tianxing, Quanjuxing, and Yongmao, providing loans of 60 million yuan to control their plans to improve production and quality, thereby promoting improved quality and influencing other industries. In addition, to more effectively support private industry and commerce, the bank adopted the form of signing loan contracts to ensure that the funds were used for specific purposes.
    With the support of bank loans, coupled with the adjustment of the overall relationship between the public and private sectors (such as taxation), private industry and commerce in Shijiazhuang have entered a stage of activity. The enthusiasm of general industrialists and merchants for operation has also greatly increased. Currently, all branches of the People's Bank are working on inspecting loan disbursements to further understand the actual difficulties of industry and commerce, so as to provide support according to the degree of urgency.

### 石市人民银行检讨贷款工作偏向后  继续扶植私营工商业

　　石市人民银行检讨贷款工作偏向后
    继续扶植私营工商业
    【本报石家庄讯】石家庄人民银行在检讨了财经统一以来贷款工作中的偏向后，六月份起继续贷款扶植私营工商业，目前各行处正着手检查放款工作。
    该行所属各行处在三月中至四月底的主要工作是贯彻货币回笼，稳定物价。因而停放贷款，促成了银根趋紧，私营工商业感到资金周转不灵。进入五月后，市场物价更形稳定。银行为了适当调节现金流通，帮助工商业恢复生产度过困难，特采用了一般紧缩，重点发放的方针，对棉织、铁工、榨油、出口物资的加工、运输等业进行扶植。
    六月份以后，银行为进一步帮助私营工商业度过困难，彻底贯彻公私兼顾，所属各行处曾在内部展开有关文件的学习，并结合实际工作，检查了过去工作中的偏向，确定了在贯彻公私兼顾、发展生产、帮助工商业度过困难的前提下，把放款面适当放宽。从五、六月份贷款数字来看，银行贷款面是在逐步地扩大着，如五月份私营工商业放款四百七十八户、余额九亿六千多万元，六月底止，放款面扩展为铁工、棉织、榨油、猪鬃、羊毛等四十七个行业，计九百四十六户，余额达二十五亿六千余万元，户头几超过五月份一倍，额数超过一·七倍。在这一贷款的帮助下，使私营工商业得以恢复和发展。如生产几陷停顿的四合公油房、利丰制棉厂、金源等铁工厂、电磨业集丰裕等户均在银行扶植下，趋向好转。
    又该行并通过贷款教育私营厂商改进业务，如桥东铸锅业在过去为争取高额利润，不择手段偷工减料，后经该行配合工业局除进行教育外，并与同益兴、天兴、全聚兴、永茂四户订立合同，贷款六千万元，掌握其改进生产、提高质量的计划，促使提高了质量，又影响带动了其他行业。此外，为了更有效地扶植私营工商业，曾采用了订定贷款合同的形式，保证专款专用。
    石市私营工商业在银行贷款扶植下，再加整个公私关系（如税收等）的调整已步入活跃。一般工商业者经营积极性亦大为提高。目前人民银行各行处正在着手检查放款工作，进一步了解工商业的实际困难，以便分别轻重缓急，加以扶植。（张治平）
