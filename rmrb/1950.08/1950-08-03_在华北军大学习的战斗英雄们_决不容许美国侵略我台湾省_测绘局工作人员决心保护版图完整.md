　　Staff of the Surveying and Mapping Bureau Determined to Protect the Integrity of the Map

　　[Our Newspaper] All faculty, staff, and students of North China Military University resolutely oppose the United States' aggressive and barbaric acts. Many veterans of the Long March and heroes from the Senior Cadre Team and Upper Cadre Team, after recalling the arduous and extraordinary circumstances of the past 25,000-li Long March, issued a warning to American imperialism with extreme indignation: Our New China was bought with the blood and lives of tens of millions. Anyone who dares to steal our fruits of victory should think about the history of the Chinese People's War of Liberation in the past one or two decades; if the aggressor's dog head insists on bumping into an iron fist, he will meet with a thorough defeat. Although we, battle-hardened comrades, are studying at school today, once Chairman Mao gives the order, war-mongering American imperialists take note! As long as we step onto the battlefield again, that will be enough to give you beasts something to see!

　　Li Ziqing, former combat hero of the Jin-Cha-Ji Military Region, Bao Wensheng, former first-class enemy-killing hero of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, and Wang Diancheng, combat hero of the Dongyingfang battle in Liaoning, also delivered speeches and broadcasted lectures on Shijiazhuang Radio Station. They said, "We are the people's combat heroes, and we must carry out a tenacious struggle to defend the motherland! We also care with the greatest enthusiasm for the victory of the Korean people's struggle." "We guarantee to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu: As long as the motherland needs us, we will definitely rush to the front line with lightning speed! Even if American imperialism sends a fleet to help Chiang Kai-shek, even ten or a hundred fleets, we will smash them to pieces and sink them all to the bottom of the sea!" "We were heroes in the past, and in this new war to defend the motherland and liberate Taiwan, we will strive to achieve even more meritorious service for the people! Thoroughly eliminate all enemies who dare to invade our country!" (Bai Hua)

　　[Our Newspaper] Staff of the Surveying and Mapping Bureau of the Military Commission's Operations Department oppose the American invasion of Taiwan. They say: Taiwan is a part of the Chinese people's territory, and the Chinese people's territory is not allowed to be invaded and sullied by traitors and imperialists. We must resolutely implement the work tasks put forward to us by our superiors, "Adapt to military needs, combine with construction work. Ensure the supply of maps for the troops liberating Taiwan and Tibet and carry out surveying and mapping operations for economic construction, and strive to compile China's maps more accurately and perfectly. Support the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet with practical work achievements, protect the integrity of our territory, and support the Korean people's war of liberation." (Shi Jianzhang)

　　在华北军大学习的战斗英雄们
    决不容许美国侵略我台湾省
    测绘局工作人员决心保护版图完整
    【本报讯】华北军大的全体教职学员坚决反对美国的侵略暴行。高干队和上干队的许多长征干部与英雄，在回忆了过去二万五千里长征中的艰苦卓绝的情形之后，以极其愤慨的心情向美帝国主义发出警告说：我们的新中国是用数千万鲜血生命换来的。谁要是胆敢来窃取我们的胜利果实，他就应想想前一二十年的中国人民解放战争的历史；侵略者的狗头硬要碰铁拳的话，他就会遭到彻底失败的命运。我们这些身经百战的伙伴，今天虽然在学校学习，而一旦毛主席有号令，美帝国主义战争贩子们注意！只要咱们再踏上战场，那就够你们这群野兽们瞧的！
    前晋察冀战斗英雄李子清，前晋冀鲁豫一等杀敌英雄暴文生，辽宁东营房战斗英雄王殿成等更纷纷发表谈话和在石家庄市广播电台广播讲演。他们说：“我们是人民的战斗英雄，我们必须为保卫祖国而进行顽强的斗争！我们并以最大的热情关怀着朝鲜人民斗争的胜利。”“我们向毛主席朱总司令保证：只要祖国需要我们，我们就一定会以飞速的行动奔赴前线！莫说美帝国主义派一个舰队来帮助蒋介石，就是十个百个舰队，我们都要将它打得粉碎，个个击沉在海底里！”“我们以往是英雄，在这保卫祖国解放台湾的新的战争中，我们将要争取为人民更多更多的立功！彻底消灭一切敢于侵犯我国的敌人！”（柏桦）
    【本报讯】军委作战部测绘局工作人员反对美国侵略台湾，他们说：台湾是中国人民领土的一部分，中国人民的领土是不允许卖国贼和帝国主义来侵略与沾污的。我们一定坚决执行上级给我们提出的工作任务，“适应军事需要，结合建设工作。保证供给解放台湾和西藏部队所用地图及进行经济建设的测绘业务，并努力把中国的地图编纂得更为正确完善。以实际工作成绩支援解放台湾和西藏，保护我们版图完整，声援朝鲜人民解放战争。（史建章）
