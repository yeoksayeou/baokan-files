　　To Struggle to Establish a People's Democratic System in India
    Indian Communist Leader Dange Calls for Organizing a Democratic United Front
    [Xinhua News Agency, dated 4th] According to a report from Telepress on the 1st, ten thousand workers and staff members held a rally in Mumbai to welcome Indian Communist leader and General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, Dange, who had been detained by the Indian government for twenty-seven months and released on July 16th due to lack of evidence. Dange delivered a speech at the rally, stating that China, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, has established a democratic government and distributed land to millions of peasants. However, the Indian government is suppressing peasants who are struggling to obtain land. He reminded the assembly that there are still tens of thousands of worker and peasant leaders imprisoned.
    After his release, Dange stated at a press conference that India, under the leadership of the working class, will form a united front of various democratic parties to oppose those who follow the orders of Anglo-American imperialists, disagree with the abolition of landlords and syndicates (monopoly enterprise combinations), and do not support the minimum living requirements of the working people. Dange said that the current policy of the Indian Communist Party differs from the previous one in that the previous policy was "left-leaning sectarianism." Dange advocated uniting all classes sympathetic to the Communist Party's policies to form a democratic united front and struggle to establish a people's democratic system in India.

　　为建立印度人民民主制度而斗争
    印共领袖丹吉号召组织民主统一战线
    【新华社四日讯】据电通社一日讯：在孟买曾有一万工人和职员举行集会，欢迎被印度政府拘禁达二十七个月之久，因为毫无罪名而于七月十六日释放的印度共产党领袖及全印职工大会总书记丹吉。丹吉在大会上发表演说称：中国在共产党和毛泽东主席的领导之下，建立了民主政府，把土地分给了千百万农民。然而印度政府却正在镇压为获得土地而斗争的农民。他提醒大会说：目前还有几万工人和农民领袖，仍被囚狱中。
    丹吉出狱后，曾在记者招待会上宣称：印度将在工人阶级的领导之下，由各民主党派组成联合阵线，反对那些唯英美帝国主义者之命是从，不同意废除地主和大辛迪卡（垄断企业组合）的统治及不支持劳动人民最低生活要求的人。丹吉说：印共现行政策和以前不同之点是：以前的政策是“左倾宗派主义的”。丹吉主张团结同情共产党政策的各阶级，结成民主统一战线，为建立印度人民民主制度而斗争。
