　　印度学生游行示威
    竟遭警察杀伤二十余人
    各地居民罢工要求惩凶
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社德里十一日电：在两天中，警察曾三次向格瓦里尔（中央印度）城举行示威游行的学生开枪。结果六人身死，三十一人受伤。学生是要求改善生活，抗议增加学费。在接到印度政府的命令后，带着摧泪性手榴弹的一队特种警察，就由德里被派到格瓦里尔去。此外还有军队由阿格拉被派到那里去。后来军队和警察占领了格瓦里尔的所有战略据点。所有机关和学校都被封闭。
    开枪和虐杀引起了格瓦里尔居民的愤怒和抗议。后来居民和警察在城里的街道上发生冲突。当地的纺织场已举行罢工，抗议加于学生的血腥迫害。抗议性的会议和示威已在印度尔、由金、勒克瑙和其他城市举行。参加示威的人要求公开调查和惩办对学生施行血腥迫害的罪犯。
