　　Celebrating "August 1st" with Practical Actions
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Workers Propose Guarantee to Launch Competition
    [Our Newspaper's Report] On the eve of "August 1st," the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's factory committee held a meeting of cadres above the group leader level, calling on all plant workers to work hard to produce, use actual production achievements to celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day, and oppose the US invasion of Taiwan and Korea; mobilize all workers to write letters of appreciation to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the People's Liberation Army, and write letters to the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, to support their just war against American imperialist aggression.
    This movement has been enthusiastically launched in the plant. Before July 31, more than 20 letters had been received from Zhu Shenyan of the Repair Department, the fitter group of the Machine Repair Department, and the fourth squad of the second detachment of the Guard Team.
    Cao Shoutian and Wang Zhenhe groups of the Power Department's boiler repair, Lü Gang and Guo Demao groups of the Power Department's lamp repair, Wang Guiwu group of the Iron Smelting Department's boiler repair, Gui Dexing group of the Raw Material Yard, workers of the Machine Repair Department's foundry, the Capital Construction Engineering Office, the Transportation Department, and various groups of the Repair Department's forging and welding yard have all put forward specific guarantees such as saving labor and materials, improving quality, reducing the scrap rate, eliminating work-related injuries, eliminating accidents, and completing tasks ahead of schedule.
    Guo Jizeng and other five groups of the Casting Pipe Yard of the Casting Department jointly proposed a competition to Zhang Guangwu and other five groups of the second shift. In addition to jointly proposing to accept the challenge from the first shift, Zhang Guangwu and other five groups of the second shift also challenged Wang Tiehai and other five groups of the third shift. Wang Tiehai and other five groups of the third shift finally jointly proposed the following conditions for accepting the challenge to the first and second shifts: ① Guarantee the daily casting of 115 iron pipes, and strive to cast 120 pipes per day (the original plan required 105 pipes); ② Guarantee an average finished product rate of 93% (the original plan required 90%).
    Workers from the foundry and the pattern shop of the Casting Department signed a contract on July 28 to reduce waste products and improve product quality. The foundry workers guaranteed: the workpieces produced will not be too thick or have mismatched seams, to take care of the wood patterns, and not to damage or make them damp; the pattern shop group guaranteed: the making and repairing of wood patterns will meet the specifications. The contract also stipulated an inspection system and a reward system.
    Wang ZhanKui, Gao Mantang, Zheng Qingbo and other nine groups in the coking department initiated a cycle competition to save manpower and time and improve labor groups and operation methods, and have created various new records in recent days. For example, the coking time usually takes 17 or 18 minutes, but the Ma Biao group created a new record of 11 minutes and 38 seconds; leveling coal usually takes 4 or 5 minutes, but the Zheng Qingbo group created a new record of leveling in 3 minutes; in terms of saving manpower, each group originally had 14 people, but this time Gao Mantang, Yan Quan, Liu Wenqing, Qi Bingzeng and other six groups used only 8 people at the minimum; the coking time of most did not exceed 17 minutes and 3 seconds, and the shortest time was only 13 minutes 5 seconds to 14 minutes. Finally, they proposed: based on the results of this competition, implement quotas, improve labor organization, change from the original three shifts to four shifts, or from the original nine shifts to seven shifts, in order to solve the unreasonable phenomenon that workers worked overtime on weekdays and had no rest time for 360 days a year.

　　以实际行动庆祝“八一”
    石景山钢铁厂职工提出保证展开竞赛
    【本报讯】“八一”前夕，石景山钢铁厂工厂委员会召开小组长以上干部会，号召全厂职工，努力生产，用实际生产成绩庆祝“八一”建军节，反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜；发动全体职工给毛主席、朱总司令暨人民解放军写慰问信，给朝鲜人民、朝鲜人民军写信，支援他们反对美帝国主义侵略的正义战争。
    这一运动已在该厂热烈展开。七月三十一日前，已收到修理部朱慎言、机修部钳工组、警卫队二区队四小队等二十多封信。
    动力部锅炉修理曹守田、王振鹤两小组，动力部电灯修理吕刚、郭德茂两小组，炼铁部锅炉修理王贵武组，原料场桂德兴组，机修部翻砂场工友，基建工程处，运输部及修理部锻焊场各小组都提出了省工省料，提高质量，减低废品率，消灭公伤，消灭事故，提前完成任务等具体保证。
    铸造部铸管场第一班郭继增等五个小组并联合向第二班张光吾等五个小组提出竞赛。第二班张光吾等五个小组除联合提出向第一班应战外，并向第三班王铁海等五组提出挑战。第三班王铁海等五组最后联合向第一、二两班提出应战条件：①保证日铸铁管一一五根，争取日铸一二○根（原计划要求一○五根）；②成品率保证平均百分之九十三（原计划要求百分之九十）。
    铸造部翻砂场与木型场工友，于七月二十八日签订了减少废品、提高产品质量的联系合同。翻砂场工友保证：做出活来不偏厚，不错缝，爱护木样，不使损坏或反潮；木型组保证：做木样和修理木样子都要合乎规格。合同中并规定了检查制度和奖励制度。
    炼焦部焦炉王占奎、高满堂、郑庆波等九个小组发起节省人力、时间及改善劳动组、操作方法的循环竞赛，连日创造了各种新纪录。如出焦时间平时用十七八分钟，马骉组创造了十一分钟三十八秒的新纪录；平煤平时四五分钟，郑庆波组创造了三分钟平完的新纪录；在节省人力方面，原来每组十四人，这次高满堂、阎泉、刘文庆、齐秉曾等六个组，最少仅用八个人；出焦时间最多者不超过十七分三秒，最少时间仅用十三分五秒至十四分钟。最后他们提出：根据这次竞赛的成绩，实行定员，改善劳动组织，由原三班倒变成四班倒，或由原来的九班倒改为七班倒，以解决过去工人星期加班，一年三百六十天没休息时间的不合理现象。
