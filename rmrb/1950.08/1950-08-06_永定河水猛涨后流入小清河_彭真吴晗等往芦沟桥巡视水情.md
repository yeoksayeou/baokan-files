　　Yongding River Waters Surge and Flow into the Xiaoqing River
    Peng Zhen, Wu Han, and Others Inspect Flood Conditions at Lugou Bridge
    [Beijing News Service] Due to continuous rain, the Yongding River's water level has surged. In the Lugou Bridge area of Beijing's suburbs, the river water reached 64.2 meters at 2:30 PM on the 4th (the day before yesterday) and began to overflow the diversion dike, flowing into the Xiaoqing River. After 3:00 PM, the water level continued to rise, and the entire 100-meter-long diversion dike was washed away. At 3:30 PM that afternoon, the water level at Lugou Bridge had reached 64.4 meters, with a flow rate of 2,700 cubic meters per second. This water level is 0.67 meters higher than the diversion water level of 63.73 meters stipulated by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government for the Lugou Bridge diversion dike, and 1.06 meters higher than the highest water level of 63.34 meters last year (the flood year). After 4:00 PM that afternoon, the water level began to drop, and by 6:00 AM yesterday (the 5th), it had dropped to 62.96 meters.
    This spring, the Beijing Municipal People's Government, in order to strengthen the dikes around Lugou Bridge, organized a Spring Work Committee to renovate or repair the dikes that had been in disrepair for many years. When the flood season was approaching this year, the committee was reorganized into a Flood Control Headquarters. In July, it mobilized more than 1,200 civilian workers in four separate instances. With the assistance of a certain division of the stationed army, they continued to widen and reinforce the diversion dike and the overflow dike, and raised the diversion dike to 64.06 meters. The completion of these projects ensured that the dikes around Lugou Bridge remained safe during the three surges of the Yongding River in July, fulfilling the task stipulated by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government—blocking the Yongding River water before the water level exceeded 63.73 meters to prevent it from overflowing into the Xiaoqing River.
    [Further News] After the water level at Lugou Bridge surged on the 4th, Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wu Han, Vice Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, Xue Zizheng, Secretary-General, and others went to Lugou Bridge at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 5th) to inspect the flood situation and listen to the report of the person in charge of the Flood Control Headquarters on flood control work.

　　永定河水猛涨后流入小清河
    彭真吴晗等往芦沟桥巡视水情
    【京市新闻处讯】连日阴雨，永定河河水猛涨，京郊芦沟桥一带河水，于前（四）日下午二时半涨至六四点二公尺后，开始漫过分水堤，流入小清河。三时以后水位继续高涨，长达一百公尺的分水堤全部冲去。该日下午三时半，芦沟桥水位已高达六四点四公尺，水流量达每秒二千七百立方公尺。这个水位较中央人民政府水利部所规定的芦沟桥分水堤分水水位六三点七三公尺高过零点六七公尺，较去年（洪水年）最高水位六三点三四公尺高过一点零六公尺。该日下午四时以后水位开始下降，截至昨（五）日上午六时止，已降至六二点九六公尺。
    今年春季，京市人民政府为加强芦沟桥一带堤防，曾组织春工委员会，将多年失修的堤岸加以改修或补修；今年汛期将至时，又将该会改组为防汛指挥部，七月间曾先后四次动员民工共一千二百余人，在驻军某师协助下，继续将分水堤与溢流堤分别加宽、加固，并将分水堤加高至六四点零六公尺。这些工程的完成保证了芦沟桥一带堤防，于七月份永定河水三度猛涨时，均能安然无恙。完成了中央人民政府水利部所规定的任务——在水位不超过六三点七三公尺以前，堵住了永定河河水，不使漫入小清河。
    【又讯】芦沟桥水位于四日猛涨后，中共北京市委员会书记彭真，北京市人民政府副市长吴晗、秘书长薛子正等，曾于昨（五）日上午十时，前往芦沟桥巡视水情，并听取了防汛指挥部负责人关于防汛工作的报告。
