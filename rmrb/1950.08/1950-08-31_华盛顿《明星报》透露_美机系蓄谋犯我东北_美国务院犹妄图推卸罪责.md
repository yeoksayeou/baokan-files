　　Washington "Star" Reveals
    US Aircraft Planned to Deliberately Invade Northeast China
    US State Department Still Attempts to Shirk Responsibility
    【Xinhua News Agency, 30th】Contrary to the US official denial of the US Air Force strafing Northeast China, the Washington Star revealed that US officials had long planned to send the Air Force to invade Northeast China. According to a Washington dispatch from the Kuomintang Central News Agency on the 26th, the Washington Star reported on the 26th of this month, the day before the US Air Force continuously attacked Andong and Linjiang areas in Northeast China, that "Officials are currently considering" "Whether the US Air Force should attack bases in Northeast China that supply the North Korean Communist army with military equipment." The so-called "supplying the North Korean Communist army with military equipment" is clearly an excuse for the US Air Force's aggressive crimes.
    【Xinhua News Agency, 29th】After Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai lodged a serious protest with the US government on August 27th regarding the intrusion of US military aircraft of the invading Korean troops into China's territorial airspace, strafing Chinese buildings, stations, vehicles, and Chinese people along the right bank of the Yalu River, resulting in casualties, and demanded that the US government punish such provocative and brutal crimes of the US Air Force and compensate for all losses, US State Department press officer McDermott hurriedly issued a statement on the 28th, sophistically denying the above-mentioned crimes of the US aircraft and attempting to shirk its responsibility. McDermott declared: "...Since all troops fighting the Communists in Korea, including US troops, are under the command of the United Nations, the protest is really a matter to be handled by the United Nations." But everyone knows that the so-called "United Nations" is nothing more than a cover for US imperialist aggression against Korea. The US government absolutely cannot shirk its responsibility for the crime of US aircraft invading Chinese territory.

### 华盛顿《明星报》透露  美机系蓄谋犯我东北  美国务院犹妄图推卸罪责

　　华盛顿《明星报》透露
    美机系蓄谋犯我东北
    美国务院犹妄图推卸罪责
    【新华社三十日讯】与美国官方否认美空军扫射东北的声明相反，华盛顿明星报透露了美国官方早已蓄谋派遣空军侵犯我国东北。据国民党中央社华盛顿二十六日电，本月二十六日，即美空军连续侵袭我东北安东、临江地区的前一日，华盛顿明星报载称：“目前官方将考虑”，“美空军是否袭击以军备供应北朝鲜共军的中国东北境内的基地。”这里所谓“以军备供应北朝鲜共军”显然是为美空军的侵略罪行制造借口。
    【新华社二十九日讯】在我国外交部周恩来部长于八月二十七日就美国侵略朝鲜军队军用飞机侵入我国领土上空，沿鸭绿江右岸扫射我国建筑物、车站、车辆和我国人民以致伤亡等事，向美国政府提出严重抗议，要求美国政府惩办美国空军此种挑衅和残暴罪行并赔偿一切损失之后，美国国务院新闻发布官麦克德谟二十八日慌张地发表谈话，狡赖美机上述罪行，并企图推卸其责任。麦克德谟宣称：“……由于所有在朝鲜与共产党作战的部队包括美国部队全在联合国指挥之下，抗议实在是一种要由联合国处理的事情。”但是谁都知道，所谓“联合国”不过是美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的掩护物。美机侵犯中国领土的罪行，美国政府绝对不能推卸其责任。
