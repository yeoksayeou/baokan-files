　　China's Currency Value Stable; British and American Currency Values Decline
    Foreign Exchange Rates Uniformly Adjusted
    [Xinhua News Agency, 8th] Based on recent fluctuations in the international currency market, the Bank of China adjusted the unified national foreign exchange rates starting from August 7th. The US dollar rate was reduced from 35,000 yuan to 32,200 yuan, a decrease of 8 percent; the British pound rate was reduced from 91,440 yuan to 81,220 yuan; other foreign currency exchange rates were also adjusted accordingly.
    Note: Since April of this year, domestic prices in the United States have been soaring. According to the New York Moody's Wholesale Price Index, the average price in mid-June increased by 10.26 percent compared to early April. After the United States' aggression in the Korean War, its domestic prices rose even further. In the one month from the end of June to late July, the average price increased by another 16.72 percent. According to the Dow Jones Index, eleven major civilian grains and industrial raw materials rose by as much as 28.8 percent. British prices also rose by 6 percent in the month before and after the outbreak of the Korean War. In stark contrast to this, the value of the Chinese Renminbi is becoming increasingly stable. For example, if the average price in early April is taken as 100, then in late July, Tianjin was 93.26, Shanghai was 86.74, and Guangzhou was 84.72. Therefore, based on the fact that the value of the Renminbi is stable and the currencies of the United States, Britain, and other countries have declined, the Bank of China has made the above adjustments to foreign exchange rates.

　　我国币值稳定·英美币值下跌
    外汇牌价统一调整
    【新华社八日讯】中国银行根据最近国际货币市场的变动，于八月七日起调整了全国统一的外汇牌价。美汇由三五、○○○元降为三二、二○○元，较前降低了百分之八；英汇由九一、四四○元降为八一、二二○元；其他外币汇价亦相应作了调整。
    按：自今年四月以后，美国国内物价高涨。据纽约马迪氏趸售物价指数，六月中旬比四月上旬平均涨了百分之十点二六。美国侵略朝鲜战事发生后，其国内物价更形上涨。六月底至七月下旬的一个月中，平均再涨百分之十六点七二。根据道琼氏指数，十一种主要民用粮食和工业原料，竟涨了百分之二十八点八。英国物价在朝鲜战事发生前后一个月内也涨了百分之六。与此形成鲜明对照的，是中国人民币值的日趋稳固。如以四月上旬物价平均数为一百，则七月下旬天津是九十三点二六，上海是八十六点七四，广州是八十四点七二，因此，根据人民币币值稳定和美、英等国币值下跌这一事实，中国银行乃将外汇牌价作了如上的调整。
