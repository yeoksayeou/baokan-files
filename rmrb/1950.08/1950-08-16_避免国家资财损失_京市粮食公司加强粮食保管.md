　　Avoid Loss of State Assets
    Beijing Grain Company Strengthens Grain Storage
    [Our Dispatch] To strengthen grain storage and vigorously carry out work to prevent rain, mildew, and insects, the Beijing Grain Company has taken action. August is the most difficult month for grain storage, not only because it is the rainy season but also the insect breeding season. At the same time, continuous rain causes the grain inside to heat up, hindering ventilation. In order to prevent the loss of state assets, the Beijing Grain Company convened a meeting of warehouse directors and storage personnel to study and decide on the following specific measures: 1. Improve the tarpaulin covering techniques for open-air stacks (i.e., the tarpaulins used to cover grain stacks), strengthen cyclical inspections before and after rain, and universally increase the use of skirt mats (i.e., mats wrapped around the bottom of the grain stack) to prevent rainwater from splashing and soaking through. 2. Combine mildew and insect prevention, using wind turbines for ventilation to blow away impurities and insects from the grain and reduce heat. 3. Because insects often breed on the grain near the outside, it was decided to convert grain stacks piled up in sacks into bulk stacks as much as possible to avoid widespread insect infestation. 4. Once insects are found inside the stack, use strong sunlight to expose the grain, causing the insects to sink, and then collect the good grain on the surface layer by layer, using a wire sieve to remove the insects.

　　避免国家资财损失
    京市粮食公司加强粮食保管
    【本报讯】北京市粮食公司为了加强粮食保管，大力展开防雨、防霉、防虫工作。八月份是粮食保管最感困难的月份，不但是多雨季节，而且是生虫季节；同时因雨水连绵，粮食内部发热，并妨碍通风工作的进行。北京市粮食公司为了使国家资财免受损失，特召集各仓库主任及保管人员进行研究，决定具体办法如下：一、改进露天囤垛苫盖（即遮粮垛用的雨布之类）技术，加强下雨前后的循环检查，普遍增加囤垛下边裙席（即围在粮垛下边的席子），以防雨水溅湿漫透。二、防霉、防虫结合进行，用风车进行出风，以便扇去粮食内之杂质及虫子，减少热度。三、因虫子常是生在靠近外部的粮食上，因此决定将用麻袋装种堆成的粮垛，尽量改为散装囤，以免多方面生虫。四、一旦发现囤内生虫时，利用强烈阳光曝晒，使虫子下沉，然后将浮面好粮逐层收起，再用铁丝筛将虫子弄出。（袁志才）
