　　Liaoxi Industrial Bureau Rectification Experience
    Inspection Work Must Start with Inspecting Leaders, Then Combine Opinions from Above and Below to Propose Major Issues.
    [Our Newspaper] According to the Liaoxi Provincial Party Committee Rectification Office: The Liaoxi Provincial Industrial Bureau has gained the following experience in the first stage of rectification: (1) Inspection and summary work should first inspect the work of leaders, and then inspect general work. At the beginning of the rectification of the Industrial Bureau, this point was not clear, and everyone was rectified together, both above and below. The first day's work inspection and enlightenment report by Deputy Director Zhao Runpu talked about the shortcomings and mistakes of various factories and mines in very specific terms, but the review of the leading cadres of the Industrial Bureau was very abstract. After hearing the report, the heads of various factories and mines felt, "We are here to be rectified!" Therefore, they were not active in putting forward opinions to the leading cadres of the bureau. On the second day, Comrade Guo Feng re-mobilized, focusing on inspiring opinions on the leading cadres of the bureau, and everyone began to put forward opinions. The opinions put forward were of great help to inspecting the leadership, and could also inspire the lower levels. (2) It is necessary to carry out ideological preparation in advance and eliminate ideological concerns in order to expose various problems. Because the leading cadres of the bureau were not clear about the policy of rectification from top to bottom, and their ideological preparation for accepting criticism was insufficient, they initially showed insufficient spirit of self-criticism. In addition, the leadership style was not democratic on weekdays, so everyone did not dare to boldly expose the shortcomings of the leadership. Later, after continuous mobilization, the responsible comrades of the bureau expressed their guarantee to humbly accept everyone's opinions, and everyone eliminated their concerns and spoke enthusiastically. (3) Not only the heads of various factories and mines are absorbed to participate, but also the main responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government participate in the meeting to enlighten and guide. Therefore, the heads of various factories and mines can put forward their own opinions without any concerns. Because the combination of top and bottom, and the combination of leadership and the masses can make the revealed problems gradually deepen and gradually improve; finally, they can be accurately summarized, raised in principle, and the main problems can be summarized. (4) When inspecting work, the existing achievements in the work should be affirmed. This was not done at the beginning of the rectification, which made some cadres think that their work was a mess, and even lost confidence. Later, in his report, Comrade Guo Feng emphasized the achievements of industrial work in the past year, and the development prospects and efforts of Liaoxi's industry, and everyone's emotions began to change. Comrade Lin Jie, on behalf of the leading side of the bureau, made a preliminary inspection and summary report in the spirit of self-criticism, which made everyone even more calm. Many comrades said: "This kind of meeting has given us methods and directions."

　　辽西工业厅整风经验
    检查工作必须从检查领导开始，然后结合上下意见提出主要问题。
    【本报讯】据中共辽西省委整风办公室报道：辽西省工业厅在整风第一阶段中已取得如下经验：（一）检查总结工作应是先检查领导工作，后检查一般工作。工业厅开始整风时对这一点是不明确的，上下一齐整。第一天赵润普副厅长的工作检查启发报告，讲到各厂矿的缺点错误很具体，但对工业厅领导干部的检讨很抽象。各厂矿的负责人听了报告后都感到：“我们这次是来挨整的！”因而对厅的领导干部提意见就不积极。第二天郭峰同志重新动员，着重启发对厅的领导干部提意见，大家才开始提出意见。提出的意见对检查领导帮助很大，并且对下级也可以起启发作用。（二）要事先进行思想酝酿，解除思想顾虑，才能揭发和暴露出各种问题。由于厅的领导干部对于自上而上的整风方针不明确，接受批评的思想准备不充分，因此开始时表现自我批评精神不够。再加上平时领导作风不民主，以致大家不敢大胆地把领导上的缺点揭发出来。后来经过不断地动员，厅的负责同志又表示保证虚心接受大家意见，大家才消除顾虑，踊跃发言。（三）不仅吸收各厂矿负责人参加，并且有省委、省府主要负责同志参加会议启发指导。各厂矿的负责人因此可以毫无顾虑地提出自己的意见来。由于能够上下相结合，领导和群众相结合，使揭发出来的问题，逐步深入，逐步提高；最后能够准确地归纳，提到原则上，并总结出主要问题来。（四）在检查工作时，应肯定工作中已有的成绩。开始整风时没有这样做，使一部分干部以为自己的工作一团糟，以至丧失信心。后来，郭峰同志在报告中着重指出了一年来工业工作中的成绩，和辽西工业的发展前途与努力方向，大家的情绪才开始转变。林洁同志又代表厅的领导方面，以自我批评的精神作了初步检查总结报告，使大家更是心平气和。很多同志说：“这样的会才使我们有了办法，有了方向。”
