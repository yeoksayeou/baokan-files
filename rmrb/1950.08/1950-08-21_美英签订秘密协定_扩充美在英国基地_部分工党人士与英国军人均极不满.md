　　US-UK Sign Secret Agreement
    Expand US Bases in Britain
    Some Labour Party Members and British Soldiers are Extremely Dissatisfied
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 20th dispatch] Berlin News: The New York correspondent of the "Berlin Daily" reported that British and American military representatives signed a secret agreement in Washington in early July, stipulating that the ranges, barracks and airports in Britain used by the US military should be expanded and modernized. Britain had previously pledged to open several airports in Oxfordshire for American heavy bombers to land.
    According to a London dispatch from the German News Agency quoted by the "Berlin Daily," this matter has aroused great dissatisfaction among some Labour Party members and British soldiers, because this agreement has completely turned Britain into a base for the US Air Force. Some people have particularly pointed out that Britain has lost its military independence and has become an executor of American plans.

　　美英签订秘密协定
    扩充美在英国基地
    部分工党人士与英国军人均极不满
    【新华社二十日讯】柏林讯：《柏林日报》驻纽约记者报道，英美两国军事代表曾于七月初在华盛顿签订了一项秘密协定，规定将英国境内由美军使用的靶场、营房和飞机场加以扩充，并使之现代化。英国前此即已承诺在牛津郡开辟几个飞机场，以便美国的重轰炸机降落。
    据《柏林日报》引德意志通讯社伦敦消息，此事在部分工党人士与英国军人间引起极大的不满，因为此项协定已将英国彻底变为美国空军的基地。有人特别指出，英国在军事上已丧失它的独立性并变为美国计划的执行者。
