Female Workers in Northeast China and Other Regions Diligently Study Technology and Actively Participate in National Economic Construction

[Reported by this newspaper] Under the leadership of the Chinese working class's political party – the Communist Party, female workers in New China have not only achieved political liberation but have also gained an increasingly important position in national economic construction. In Northeast China, North China, and East China, many female workers have taken on new jobs after technical training. In Shenyang, Harbin, Lüda, Anshan, Mudanjiang, Changchun, and other places in Northeast China, approximately 2,556 female technicians and apprentices are distributed across 17 industries and 46 types of technical work in machinery, shipbuilding, railways, and other sectors. The emergence of outstanding female technicians such as female train driver Tian Guiying, female lathe operator Qi Guizhi, and female tractor driver Liang Jun has not only attracted the attention of enterprise leaders, correcting the past erroneous idea that female workers could not learn and master technology, but more importantly, it has encouraged the vast number of young female workers' confidence in learning technology. Recently, many female workers in North China and East China have also taken on technical jobs. In Tianjin and Qingdao, many female workers in textile factories have participated in maintenance work studies; female passenger attendant teams have appeared on express trains on the Beijing-Tianjin Railway; female workers in the Jinan Cigarette Factory have learned to use machines for production; and Beijing has also trained female tram conductors and female car inspectors.

The emergence of female technicians is mainly due to the change in the social status of female workers after liberation and the continuous improvement of their political consciousness. They are working hard to learn technology in order to actively participate in national construction work. At the same time, trade union organizations at all levels and in various industries can also promptly pay attention to helping female workers solve difficulties in learning technology. For example, in the past, female apprentices at the Lüda Shipyard Boiler Factory were asked by their masters to bake pancakes, buy groceries, and buy cigarettes during working hours. This feudal-tinged master-apprentice relationship, which belittled the labor of female apprentices, naturally prevented the female apprentices from learning any technology. After the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions reflected opinions to the factory administration and corrected this master-apprentice relationship, the female apprentices were able to learn technology effectively. Trade unions at all levels also frequently organize forums for female technicians to exchange experiences, especially conducting mass propaganda and mobilization work for female workers. For example, the Lüda Federation of Trade Unions, in conjunction with the administrative department, held a mass rally to celebrate female train driver Tian Guiying's first trip; and the Shenyang City invited female technicians to report on their work during the "March 8th" Women's Day this year, which further encouraged and strengthened the vast number of female workers' understanding and confidence in learning technology. In addition, the enthusiastic help and encouragement of Soviet experts in helping female workers learn and master technology has also played a significant role in promoting the development of female workers' work.

　　东北等地女工努力学习技术  积极参加国家经济建设工作
    【本报讯】新中国的女工在中国工人阶级的政党——共产党的领导下，在政治上获得解放后，在国家经济建设工作中也已获得日益重要的地位。东北、华北、华东各地有不少女工经过技术学习，走向新的工作岗位。在东北的沈阳、哈尔滨、旅大、鞍山、牡丹江、长春等地分布在机器、造船、铁路等十七个产业、四十六种技术工作中的女技工、女工徒共约二千五百五十六人。女火车司机田桂英、女旋盘工戚桂芝、女拖拉机手梁军等优秀的女技工的出现，不仅引起了企业领导方面的重视，纠正了过去认为女工不能学习和掌握技术的错误思想；更重要的，是鼓励了广大青年女工对学习技术的信心。最近华北、华东地区也有不少女工走上了技术工作岗位。天津、青岛有不少纱厂的女工参加了保全工的学习；京津铁路快车上出现了女包乘组；济南烟厂女工学会了使用机器生产；北京也培养了女电车乘务员和女检车员。
    女技工的出现，主要是由于女工在解放后社会地位的改变，政治觉悟不断的提高，她们为了积极参加国家建设工作而努力学习技术；同时，各地区各产业工会组织也能及时注意帮助女工解决学习技术时的困难。如过去旅大船渠锅炉厂的女工徒，在工作时间被师傅叫去烤饼子、买菜、买烟卷。这种带有封建色彩的师徒关系，轻视女工徒的劳动力的情形，自然会使该厂女工徒学习不了什么技术。经过旅大总工会向该厂行政上反映意见，改正了这种师徒关系，女工徒从此才能很好的学习技术。各地工会并时常组织女技工座谈会，交流经验，尤其是对女工们进行群众性的宣传鼓动工作。如旅大总工会结合行政方面举办的女火车司机田桂英的出车典礼群众大会；沈阳市在今年“三八”妇女节请女技工作报告，更鼓舞和加强了广大女工对学习技术的认识与信心。此外，苏联专家热情的帮助和鼓励女工学习和掌握技术，对女工工作的开展也起了很大的推动作用。（雷希嘉）
