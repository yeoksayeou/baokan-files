　　Prices of major daily necessities across the country were stable in July. Although the prices of some commodities and imported goods once experienced speculative fluctuations due to the influence of foreign markets, the fluctuations quickly stopped due to the government's resolute implementation of the policy of stabilizing prices. According to statistics from the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government: the average wholesale price of 25 major commodities nationwide in early July increased by 5.3 percent compared with late June, increased by 2.1 percent in mid-July compared with early July, and increased slightly by 1.4 percent in late July.
    Statistical data for commodity types are as follows: the price of food grains in early July decreased by 0.5 percent compared with late June, rebounded by 0.5 percent in mid-July, and increased by 0.7 percent in late July.
    The price of cotton yarn and cloth increased by 3.2 percent in early July, slightly increased by 0.5 percent in mid-July, and decreased by 0.8 percent in late July due to continued price adjustments. The prices of the above two major daily necessities were completely stable. Other types have risen slightly: non-staple food increased by 11.2 percent in early July, 4.1 percent in mid-July, and 4.1 percent in late July; fuel increased by 3.8 percent in early July, 4.3 percent in mid-July, and 4.2 percent in late July, groceries increased by 8.3 percent in early July, 2.8 percent in mid-July, and 1 percent in late July; in addition, the black market price of gold and silver increased by 11.4 percent in early July, remained stable in mid-July, and decreased by 0.7 percent in late July. The increase in the average prices of the above types of commodities was affected by several imported goods such as white sugar and kerosene, and several major department store goods such as white paper and vulcanized blue, and the price increase was limited to early July. The prices of some commodities began to fall in mid-July. For example, the average price of white sugar in the Shanghai market in mid-July had fallen by 3.8 percent, vulcanized blue fell by 4.5 percent, and gold also fell by 7.3 percent.
    In addition, other imported materials such as chemical raw materials, hardware and equipment, and Western medicines also rose slightly in early July. Taking Shanghai as an example: from June 27 to July 7, the price of Yuepai caustic soda rose by 24.4 percent, potassium dichromate rose by 43.9 percent, light bulbs rose by 67.4 percent, and saw blades rose by 32.1 percent. In the Tianjin market, from June 25 to July 7, five-millimeter English boards and tinplate each rose by 14.3 percent, dinitro rose by 17.65 percent, and penicillin rose by 24.5 percent.
    This round of price fluctuations began in late June, that is, after US imperialism began to launch its war of aggression against Korea. At that time, some businessmen did not understand the truth and invested their funds in the gold and silver black market, and speculators also took the opportunity to make trouble. Therefore, the black market price of gold and silver first rose starting from June 27. After Truman issued his arrogant statement, rumors arose in foreign markets, and the prices of various goods rose, affecting the prices of imported goods in the country, and speculators took the opportunity to snap up imported goods such as hardware, equipment, Western medicines, and chemical raw materials. White sugar rose because the peak season had arrived, and the state trading company had not paid enough attention to this in the past, so unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to drive up prices and snap up goods, causing market prices to rise.
    In early July, the People's Government vigorously suppressed prices. In addition to ordering state-owned import trading companies to sell goods and supplying imported equipment and raw materials to various state-owned factories and enterprises with a focus, it also transferred a large amount of vulcanized blue, white sugar, and other materials from the Northeast region to Tianjin, and transferred a large amount of white sugar from sugar-producing areas such as Fujian to Shanghai. Therefore, this fluctuation subsided in mid-July. Some unscrupulous merchants once used floating capital to disrupt the grain and yarn market in early July, causing the transaction volume of grain and yarn in various places to increase sharply for a time. The total transaction volume of cotton cloth in Tianjin in early June was only 12,450 pieces, and the transaction volume reached 7,500 pieces in one day on July 3. Compared with June 30, the transaction volume of grain in Shanghai on July 7 increased by 7.5 times, of which the sales volume of the company increased from 230 bags to 13,490 bags. However, thanks to the strong strength of the state trading company and proper scheduling, the conspiracy of unscrupulous merchants ultimately failed.
    The price dynamics in July once again proved that the government has sufficient power to stabilize prices; however, speculative factors still exist in the market, so some commodities that the government has not paid attention to have been taken advantage of by speculators. We must be highly vigilant in the future and pay attention to several materials other than the main commodities. In addition, when the price of imported equipment rose in early July, many public enterprises and institutions purchased goods directly from the market in violation of regulations without going through the local industrial and commercial departments, which also affected the price increase to some extent. This phenomenon should also be strictly corrected in the future.

### 全国各地主要日用品价格平稳  七月份物价动态再度证明政府有足够力量稳定物价

　　全国各地主要日用品价格平稳
    七月份物价动态再度证明政府有足够力量稳定物价
    【新华社九日讯】七月份全国各地主要日用必需品价格平稳。部分商品及进口物资价格虽曾受国外市场影响而一度发生投机性的波动，但由于政府坚决执行稳定物价的政策，波动迅即停止。据中央人民政府贸易部统计：七月上旬全国二十五种主要商品的平均批发价格比六月下旬上升百分之五点三，中旬比上旬上升百分之二点一，下旬略升百分之一点四。
    以商品种类分别统计：粮食类七月上旬比六月下旬下降百分之零点五，中旬回升百分之零点五，下旬升百分之零点七。
    花纱布类由于继续调整价格，上旬升百分之三点二，中旬略升百分之零点五，下旬降落百分之零点八。上述两类主要日用必需品价格完全平稳。其他各类略有上涨：副食品上旬升百分之十一点二，中旬升百分之四点一，下旬升百分之四点一；燃料上旬升百分之三点八，中旬升百分之四点三，下旬升百分之四点二，杂货上旬升百分之八点三，中旬升百分之二点八，下旬升百分之一；此外，金银黑市上旬升百分之十一点四，中旬平稳，下旬降落百分之零点七。以上几类商品平均价格的上升，是受白糖、煤油等几种进口物资及白报纸、硫化青等几种主要百货的影响，而且涨风亦仅止于上旬。部分商品到七月中旬已开始回落，如七月中旬上海市场白糖平均价格已下落百分之三点八，硫化青下落百分之四点五，黄金也下落百分之七点三。
    此外，其他进口物资如化工原料、五金器材、西药等，七月上旬亦略有上涨。以上海为例：六月二十七日到七月七日月牌烧碱上涨百分之二十四点四，红矾钾涨百分之四十三点九，灯泡涨百分之六十七点四，锯条涨百分之三十二点一。天津市场六月二十五日到七月七日，五厘英板和马口铁各涨百分之十四点三，二硝基涨百分之十七点六五，盘尼西林涨百分之二十四点五。
    此次部分物价波动开始于六月下旬，即在美帝国主义开始发动侵略朝鲜的战争之后。当时，有些商人不明真相，将资金投入金银黑市，而投机商人亦乘机作祟。因此自六月二十七日起，金银黑市首先涨价。杜鲁门发表狂妄声明后，国外市场更是谣言蜂起，各货上涨，影响国内进口物资价格亦随着上升，投机商人乘机抢购五金器材、西药、化工原料等进口物资。白糖则因旺季已到，国家贸易公司过去对此未充分注意，奸商遂乘隙哄抬抢购，市价因而上涨。
    人民政府在七月初即大力平抑物价，除令国营进口贸易公司进行抛售，以及向各国营工厂、企业有重点地供应进口器材、原料外，并从东北地区调运大量硫化青、白糖等物资到天津，由福建等产糖区调运大批白糖到上海，因此这一波动到七月中旬即告平定。部分奸商曾于七月上旬以游资扰乱粮食、纱布市场，使得各地粮食与纱布成交量一度呈激增之势。天津市六月上旬棉布总成交量仅一万二千四百五十匹，七月三日一天内成交即达七千五百匹。上海粮食成交量七月七日与六月三十日相比，面粉增加七倍半，其中公司出售量由二百三十袋增加到一万三千四百九十袋之多。但是由于国家贸易公司实力雄厚，调度得宜，奸商阴谋终未得逞。
    七月份物价动态再度证明政府有足够力量稳定物价；但是，市场上投机因素仍然存在，因此某些政府注意力所未及的商品便为投机商人所乘，今后必须引起高度警惕，注意掌握主要商品以外的几种物资。此外，七月上旬进口器材上涨时，曾有不少公营企业机关不通过当地工商部门，违法直接到市场购货，也多少影响了物价上涨；这种现象今后也应严加纠正。
