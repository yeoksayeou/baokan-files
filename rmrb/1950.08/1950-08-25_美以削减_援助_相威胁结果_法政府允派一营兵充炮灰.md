Xinhua News Agency, August 24th—According to Reuters: Under pressure from the U.S. government, the French government, following the governments of Britain and Australia, has decided to send a small number of troops to Korea to serve the U.S. imperialists. A communiqué issued by the French government on the 22nd stated that France would send a "specially organized field battalion," numbering approximately 800 to 1,000 men. Under the threat from the U.S. of "reducing Marshall Plan funds," the French government, while agreeing to immediately supply the U.S. with a small amount of cannon fodder, is still adopting delaying tactics regarding the date of deployment. French Prime Minister Pleven said on the 22nd that new recruits who might be assigned to the troops sent to Korea still "need to undergo a period of training."

According to a report from United Press: The Belgian government is also considering a plan to immediately send a battalion of infantry to Korea. This plan was proposed by Belgian Foreign Minister Tsiran, and "Tsiran's proposal is the result of a meeting with U.S. officials on Monday (the 21st)."

　　美以削减“援助”相威胁结果
    法政府允派一营兵充炮灰
    【新华社二十四日讯】据路透社讯：在美国政府的压力下，法国政府已继英、澳两国政府之后，决定派遣少量部队赴朝鲜，为美帝国主义卖命。法国政府二十二日发表的公报说：法国即将派出一个“特别组织的野战营”，为数约八百至一千人。法国政府在美国以“削减马歇尔计划拨款”的威胁下，虽然答应立即供应美国少量炮灰，但对于出兵日期仍采取拖延策略。法总理普利文二十二日说，可能被编入派赴朝鲜的部队的新兵，尚“须经过一个时期的训练”。
    另据合众社讯：比利时政府亦正考虑即派步兵一营赴朝鲜的计划。这一计划系由比外长齐兰所提出，而“齐兰的建议，是星期一（二十一日）与美国官员举行会议的结果”。
