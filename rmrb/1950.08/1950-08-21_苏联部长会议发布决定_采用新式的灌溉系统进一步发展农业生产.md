Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th dispatch from TASS: The Soviet Council of Ministers has recently issued a decision on adopting new irrigation systems to more fully utilize irrigated land and improve mechanized farming.

The decision points out that irrigated farming in the Soviet Union has developed on a large scale. In Central Asia and the Transcaucasus, water conservancy and irrigation are decisive factors in ensuring bumper harvests every year and further developing agriculture. In the Central Black Earth Region and other grassland and forest-grassland zones of the European part of the Soviet Union, water conservancy and irrigation also have an increasingly important role in the fight against drought and ensuring bumper harvests.

The Soviet Council of Ministers believes that the main task currently facing Party, Soviet, and agricultural organizations in various irrigation areas is to improve the use of irrigated land, to maximize the mechanization of farmland operations, and to widely adopt advanced agronomic methods in irrigated farming, in order to ensure the rapid improvement of the quality of various crops on irrigated land.

The decision points out that the existing irrigation systems are lagging behind the level of modern agriculture. These systems hinder the efficient use of tractors, combines, and other complex machinery, hinder the full use of irrigated land, and cause some crops to be lost. At the same time, these systems increase the engineering work of dredging silted canals, increase the loss of water seepage, and help the growth of weeds and the breeding of agricultural pests.

Many advanced state farms, collective farms, and scientific research institutions have invented and practically applied a new and improved method of arranging irrigation networks, namely: instead of permanent irrigation canals, temporary canals are used, which are only used during the irrigation period and then filled in to meet the needs of mechanized farming and crop planting.

Based on the materials provided by advanced science and the experience of various collective farms, the Soviet Council of Ministers has adopted a decision to use temporary irrigation canals and adopt a new irrigation system in all irrigation areas. This new irrigation system makes it possible for us to use irrigated land more effectively by abolishing permanent irrigation canals, to increase the area of irrigation areas, and thus to use complex technology on a larger scale. At the same time, it also ensures the improvement of irrigation water use, reduces reclamation costs, and helps eliminate various conditions conducive to weed growth and agricultural pest breeding.

The government has stipulated the task of having all collective farms and state farms in various irrigation areas adopt the new irrigation system within three to four years. The government has approved a plan for the transformation of irrigation systems. A large number of machines needed for the large-scale adoption of new irrigation systems will be transported to various irrigation areas for use. The government has also established a special system for training instructors and other experts to carry out this work. The costs required for the design and survey work and technical supervision work for the transformation of the irrigation systems of various collective farms will be included in the state budget. The state will bear 40 percent of the construction costs for the transformation of irrigation systems, and the remaining 60 percent will be paid by the collective farms.

### 苏联部长会议发布决定  采用新式的灌溉系统进一步发展农业生产

　　苏联部长会议发布决定
    采用新式的灌溉系统进一步发展农业生产
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议顷发布关于采用新的灌溉系统，以更充分地利用受灌溉的土地并改良动力耕种的决定。
    决定指出：苏联的灌溉耕种已发展具有了很大的规模。在中亚细亚和外高加索，水利灌溉是保证年年丰收和进一步发展农业的决定性的因素。在中央黑土地带和其他苏联欧洲部分的草原与森林草原地带，水利灌溉在防旱斗争与保证丰收中也具有日益增大的重要性。
    苏联部长会议认为：目前在各灌溉地区的党、苏维埃及农业组织所面临的主要任务，是改良受灌溉的土地的使用，以尽量使农田工作机械化，和广泛采用灌溉耕种方面的先进农艺方法，以保证在受灌溉的土地上更进一步地迅速提高各种农作物的质量。
    决定指出，现有的灌溉系统是落后于现代农业水平的。这种系统妨害了拖拉机、联合机和其他复杂的机器的高效率的利用，妨害了受灌溉的土地的充分使用，使农作物的某些部分受到损失。同时，这种系统增加了疏导淤塞的水渠的工程，增加了水的渗透的损失，而且帮助了野草滋生和农业害虫的繁殖。
    许多先进的国营农场、集体农场以及科学研究机关已经发明而且实际应用了一种新的完善的安排灌溉网的方法，即：不用永久性灌溉渠制，而代之以临时水渠，这种水渠仅在灌水时期运用，过后便予填平，以符合动力耕种和种植农作物之需。
    苏联部长会议根据先进科学及各集体农场经验所提供的材料，已经通过决定，在所有灌溉区中，利用临时灌溉渠，采用新的灌溉系统。这种新的灌溉系统使我们有可能经由废除永久性灌溉渠来更有效地使用受灌溉的土地，有可能增加灌溉地区的面积，从而更大规模地使用复杂的技术。同时，它也保证了灌溉水量利用的改善，减低了开垦的费用，并且有助于消除各种利于野草滋长和农害繁殖的条件。
    政府已经规定了任务，要在三——四年之内，使各灌溉区中的所有集体农场和国营农场都采用该项新的灌溉系统。政府已经通过了灌溉系统的改造计划。大批采用新灌溉系统所需的机器将运往各灌溉地区以供使用。并且政府已经制定了专门为训练指导员和其他专家以进行是项工作的制度。改造各集体农场灌溉系统的设计和勘测工作与技术监督工作所需的费用，将列入国家预算之内。在改造灌溉系统方面建设工程费用的百分之四十由国家负担，其余百分之六十则由集体农场支付。
