Xinhua News Agency, London, 2nd Dispatch from TASS: The British Trades Union Congress will convene in Brighton, Sussex, from September 4th to 8th. Several trade union resolutions listed on the preliminary agenda uniformly propose the abolition of atomic bombs.

　　The National Union of Vehicle Builders calls for a declaration that atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and all other weapons of mass destruction be outlawed. The Tobacco Workers' Union urges the TUC General Council to convene a national peace conference of representatives from affiliated unions to formulate proposals calling for the abolition of all atomic weapons.

　　The Foundry Workers' Union's resolution states: the most reliable guarantee of peace is the establishment of unrestricted trade with other countries (including the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies); it also states: the union opposes the various restrictions imposed on such trade by the Marshall Plan.

　　Several unions expressed extreme dissatisfaction regarding domestic issues, namely, the continuing decline in workers' living standards while monopoly profits continue to increase.

　　The National Union of Railwaymen, one of the largest unions in Britain with approximately 500,000 members, expressed astonishment at the increase in the cost of living and urged the TUC General Council to compel the government to take strong action to drastically reduce prices and capitalist profits.

　　The Electrical Trades Union moved that the TUC should strongly oppose the wage restriction policy that is comprehensively lowering the living standards of working people. The TUC protests that the government has still not taken effective steps to prevent the unlimited increase in capitalist profits.

　　Another issue that has provoked dissatisfaction among the unions is the government's policy of running nationalized industries. Many trade union organizations protest that the nationalized industry bureaus are undemocratic and incompetent.

　　英国许多工会决议
    要求废除原子武器
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国职工大会将于九月四日至八日在萨塞克斯郡布来顿开会。初步议程上所列若干工会的决议案，都一致提出废除原子弹的要求。
    全国造车工人联合会要求宣布原子弹、氢弹以及其他有大批杀伤力的各种武器为非法。烟草工人工会敦促职工大会最高委员会召集所属各工会代表，举行全英和平大会，以求拟订建议，要求废除一切原子武器。
    铸造工人联合会的决议称：最可靠的和平保证，是与其他国家（包括苏联、中国及人民民主国家）建立不受限制的通商；又称：该联合会反对马歇尔计划对这种贸易所加的种种限制。
    若干工会在国内问题方面表示：对于现在的情况——工人生活水准继续下降而垄断利润则继续增高——极为不满。
    拥有会员约五十万人的全英最大工会之一的全国铁路工人工会，对于生活费用的增高表示惊异，并敦促职工大会最高委员会迫使政府采取有力行动，使物价及资本家的利润大量降低。
    电气工人工会提出动议称：职工大会应强烈反对使劳动人民生活水平全面低落的限制工资政策。职工大会对于政府至今仍未采取防止资本家利润无限度增高的有效步骤一点，表示抗议。
    另外一件招致各工会不满的，就是政府经营国有化工业的政策。许多工会组织抗议称：各国营工业局是不民主而且无能的。
