The Experience of the Assembly Shop Committee of the Jilin No. 41 Factory in Leading Production
    Jia Zefang
    [This report from Jilin] The assembly shop of the Jilin No. 41 Factory has created a new collective record, exceeding the quota by 100%, thanks to the shop committee's in-depth leadership in production. Their ability to implement the trade union's policy of focusing on production is inseparable from the work performance of the shop committee director, Hu Hengshun.

  Leading Cadres Go Deep into Shop Groups
    Hu Hengshun was originally a skilled worker. He always felt that some trade union chairmen were busy all day approving notes and lending money for administrative work, and some workers were dissatisfied and complained a lot, resulting in the trade union not playing its due role. After he was elected as the branch chairman, he deeply felt that only by focusing on production could the trade union establish prestige among the masses. But how could the trade union focus on production? He felt that staying in the office could not face production, so his first step was to go to the workshop to see which group was too busy, which workers had difficulties in their work, and he would help research and solve them. For example, he found that the department that made waterwheel chains had the lowest output, which risked affecting the completion of the entire task, so he personally led the effort, studying what problems existed in production. He found that the oil for tempering chains was smelly and dirty, and workers had to be burned by the fire, so no one liked to do it. He suggested to the administration that masks and foot covers be made for the workers; he picked up the furnace hook and led the work. With his help and promotion, the daily output increased three and a half times, and like other departments, the task was completed ahead of schedule. For example, the ninth group was inefficient and tired, yet still couldn't produce enough due to improper division of labor. Old Hu personally worked in their group for a day, found the problems, and helped them reorganize the division of labor and establish a responsibility system, correcting the past chaotic phenomena of only focusing on one's own work without paying attention to planning and division of labor, which delayed production time.
    Old Hu paid great attention to making production promotion the central content of trade union group activities. He often thought that the group was like a machine part of the branch. If the part has a problem, don't expect good finished products. He believed that in the past, trade union groups only discussed membership fees or labor insurance and food issues at meetings, and they were tired of attending group meetings. In order to correct the deviation of group activities, he found typical groups to study. For example, the Zhao Xingzhou group did not have two open cotter pins (waterwheel parts), which affected the completion of the entire waterwheel task, so he helped hold a group meeting. After everyone's research, it was decided to find a way to solve the problem themselves. All the workers in the group took time out of their spare time to trial-produce a tool (cotter pin mold), and used old iron wire to make more than 900 cotter pins, so that the factory's waterwheel production task was successfully completed. Old Hu gained experience from this: production content enriches group life, and can solve production problems for everyone, so group life seems very energetic, and some group meetings have become an indispensable part of workers' lives.

  Implement Production Plans and Master Production Situation
    The assembly shop committee often pays attention to supervising the implementation of group and individual production plans and promptly grasping the progress of production. The production officers of each group are mainly responsible for grasping the production figures of each worker in the group, supervising the implementation of the plan, and reporting the production situation of the group to the shop production committee at any time. The production committee members must check and supervise according to the plans of each group, understand and help solve problems in production, and report a monthly production summary to the factory trade union. This is an important step for the trade union to lead production.
    Whenever a production task is assigned, the shop committee first conducts a careful study and puts forward the points that each group should pay attention to. This not only reduces waste products, but also ensures the vigorous implementation of the production plan.
    The members of the shop committee have a clear division of labor. For example, the production committee member is responsible for arranging and summarizing the production of the shop and mastering the production situation of the entire shop. When learning production technology, the study committee member and the production committee member are jointly responsible for the leadership. For example, Zhang Enfu is the production committee member of the shop branch and personally serves as a technical instructor. The labor protection and welfare committee member grasps the labor protection officers of the groups to do a good job in labor protection. The cultural and educational committee members and organizational committee members each have their own responsibilities and closely focus on production to carry out their work, playing a core leading role in shop production.

  Close Cooperation between Party, Government, Trade Union, and Youth League
    The shop committee closely relies on the leadership of the Party. The branch chairman reports trade union work to the branch committee on time (Editor's note: It is correct to report trade union work to the branch committee on time, but this work should be carried out by the trade union party group). The chairman puts forward work plans, absorbs the opinions of the branch committee; when the branch committee deploys work, it also conveys the trade union's plan to the party members, asking everyone to guarantee the realization of the plan. In this way, the trade union's plan has a solid foundation, and the branch committee also has a deeper understanding of the masses' thoughts, which is convenient for carrying out ideological leadership.
    The administration's attention to trade union work is also one of the conditions for doing a good job in trade union work. When the administration of the shop deploys a certain task, it first convenes a meeting attended by the branch chairman, shop director, party branch secretary, and youth league branch secretary to discuss it together (Editor's note: If the management committee has been established in the department, there is no need to convene this kind of joint meeting). The trade union formulates a more specific trade union work plan based on the administrative plan and the Party's intentions, and implements it to the groups. In the groups, the trade union and the administrative group leaders are jointly responsible for supervising and inspecting the completion of the tasks of the group (Editor's note: Although the purpose is the same, the working methods and responsibilities should be different. It is hoped that supplementary reports can be provided). The administration holds production meetings, and cadres above the trade union group leader level participate; the trade union holds production-related meetings, and administrative cadres above the group leader level also participate, and jointly discuss and formulate the production plan of the shop (branch) and are jointly responsible for the completion. In terms of pace, the union and administration maintain mutual consistency and overcome the previous working methods of each doing their own thing (Editor's note: It is good for the government and trade union to cooperate closely and lead production in a unified pace, but the article does not explain the different working methods and tasks of the government and trade union sufficiently, and it is hoped that supplementary reports can be provided). Thanks to the Party's care and the trade union's help, the Youth League's life in the department is very active, and it has played a great role in carrying out trade union work. If the Youth League members have any problems, the trade union proactively helps to solve them, so the Youth League is also very close to the trade union and actively participates in the trade union's activities. For example, the Youth League members are the ones who publish blackboards and write slogans. The Youth League members have become active members of trade union work.
    In production, the trade union cares very much about the workers' lives, learning, and welfare. For example, Old Hu felt that the workers were eating cold food and drinking cold water at noon, which was detrimental to their health, so he suggested that the administration make large steamers and kettles, and the workers got hot food and boiling water to drink every day. Under the mobilization of the branch, 68% of the workers began to save money, helping everyone overcome the wasteful phenomenon of eating and drinking extravagantly. Regarding the difficulty of drinking water for the workers' families, Hu Hengshun personally signed a contract with the Water Bureau to solve the difficulty of drinking water.

    The shop committee conscientiously organizes workers to learn. The technical learning basically adopts the method of learning what you do, mutual teaching and mutual learning. Learn how to make waterwheel parts when making waterwheels. Problems discovered in production are brought to the classroom for discussion, and everyone feels that learning is of great help to them. Overcome the idea that individual teachers care about face (afraid of being laughed at by the masses if they say they don't understand). Teachers and students become one, learn from each other, and work together to improve technology and culture. The technical instructor is Zhang Enfu, the production committee member of the trade union. After finishing his lectures, he takes his notebook and goes around asking people, and then compares what he learns from everyone with mechanical principles to create vivid teaching materials. Everyone is particularly enthusiastic when learning. As soon as the class bell rings, everyone rushes into the classroom, fearing that they will be late and learn less.

　　吉林四一工厂装配间车间委员会领导生产的经验
    贾泽芳
    【本报吉林讯】吉林四一工厂装配间，因车间委员会深入领导生产，创造了超过定额一倍的集体新纪录。他们能贯彻工会面向生产的方针，是和车间委员会主任扈恒顺的工作成绩分不开的。
  领导干部深入车间小组
    扈恒顺本是个熟练工人，平时他就觉得有的工会主席整天忙着批条子、借钱等事务工作，有的工人不满足还大发牢骚，结果工会不能起应有的作用。他当选为分会主任后，深感工会只有面向生产才能在群众中树立威信。但工会工作怎样面向生产呢？他觉得呆在办公室里是不能面向生产的，于是他第一步是到工作间去，看那个小组活忙不过来，那个工人工作上有困难，他就帮助研究解决。如有一次他发现制造水车链子的部门产量最少，有影响整个任务完成的危险，他便亲自去领导，研究生产中存在什么问题。他发现链子炶油又臭又脏还得挨火烤，谁都不爱干，他便向行政建议，给工人作了口罩、脚盖；自己拿起炉钩子领着干。在他的帮助和推动下，每日产量提高三倍半，和其他部门一样提前完成了任务。又如：九小组由于分工不适当，人累还作不出活。老扈就亲自到他组里工作一天，找出了毛病，帮助他们重新分工，建立专责制，纠正过去只顾个人闷头干，不注意计划和分工，耽误了生产时间等忙乱现象。
    老扈非常注意把推动生产作为工会小组活动的中心内容。他常想，小组好比是分会的一个机器零件，如果零件有毛病，就别指望出好成品。他认为过去工会小组一开会不是讨论会费就是讨论劳保、伙食问题，都厌烦开小组会。为了纠正小组活动的偏向，他便找出典型小组来研究。如赵兴洲小组没有两开肖子（水车零件），影响整个水车任务的完成，他便帮助开小组会，经大家研究结果，决定自己想办法解决。全组工友抽出业余时间试制出一个工具（肖子胎），利用旧铁丝共作了九百多个肖子，使全厂水车生产任务顺利完成。老扈从这里得到经验，生产内容充实了小组生活，能给大家解决生产上的问题，所以小组生活显得很有生气，有些组小组会议已成职工不可缺少的生活内容。
  贯彻生产计划掌握生产情况
    装配间车间委员会经常注意督促小组、个人生产计划的执行，及时掌握生产进行情况。各小组的生产干事，主要负责掌握全组每个职工的生产数字，监督执行计划，随时向车间生产委员报告本组的生产情况。生产委员要按各小组的计划进行检查督促，了解与帮助解决生产中的问题，按月向厂工会作生产总结报告。这是工会领导生产的重要步骤。
    每当生产任务下来后，车间委员会首先经过仔细研究，并向各小组提出应该注意的地方，这样不但可以减少废品，生产计划也能得到有力保证。
    车间委员会的委员们都有明确分工，如生产委员负责布置与总结本车间的生产，掌握全车间的生产情况。在学习生产技术的时候，就由学习委员与生产委员共同负责领导。如张恩富是车间分会的生产委员，亲任技术教员。劳保福利委员就抓住小组的劳保干事作好劳保工作，文教委员、组织委员各有专责，并紧密围绕生产进行工作，都起了车间生产的核心领导作用。
  党、政、工、团密切配合
    车间委员会紧紧依靠党的领导，分会主席按时在支部委员会上报告工会工作，（编者按：按时在支委会上报告工会工作是对的，但此项工作应由工会党组负责进行。）提出工作计划；吸收支部意见；支部在布置工作时，也把工会的计划传达给党员，要大家保证计划的实现。这样，工会的计划就有巩固的基础，支部也更深刻的了解群众的思想情况，便于进行思想领导。
    行政重视工会工作，也是搞好工会工作的条件之一。该车间行政布置某项工作时，首先召开有分会主席、车间主任、党支书、团支书参加的会议共同讨论（编者按：该部如已成立管委会，则不必再召开此种联席会）。工会根据行政计划及党的意图，拟定出更具体的工会工作计划，贯彻到小组里去。在小组里，工会和行政的小组长共同负责督促检查本小组的任务完成情况（编者按：目的虽同，但工作方法和职责应各有不同）。行政开生产会，工会小组长以上干部参加；工会开生产方面的会议，也找行政小组长以上干部参加，共同讨论订出本车间（分会）的生产计划，并共同负责完成，在步调上和行政互相取得一致，克服了过去各搞一套的工作方法（编者按：政、工密切配合，统一步调领导生产是好的，但文中对政工不同的工作方法和任务则说明不够，希能补充报道）。由于党的关心、工会的帮助，该部团的生活搞的很活跃，在开展工会工作上起了很大作用。青年团员有什么问题，工会主动帮助解决，所以团也很靠近工会，积极参加工会的活动。如出黑板报、写标语等，都是团员来干的。青年团员成为工会工作中的活动分子。
    在生产中，工会很关怀职工生活、学习及福利事业。如老扈感到工友们晌午都吃凉饭，喝凉水，有碍健康，他便建议行政作了大笼屉及水壶，工友们每天都得了热饭吃开水喝。在分会动员下，百分之六十八的工人都开始储蓄，帮助大家克服了大吃大喝的浪费现象。对工友家属吃水困难，扈恒顺便亲自和水道局订立了合同，解决了吃水困难。
    车间委员会认真组织职工进行学习。对技术学习基本采取了做什么学什么的互教互学方法。作水车就学水车零件怎样作。生产中发现问题提到课堂去讨论，大家都感到学习对自己帮助很大。打破个别老师爱面子（怕说自己不懂叫群众笑话）的想法，师徒打成一片，互相学习，共同努力提高技术和文化。技术教员就是工会的生产委员张恩富，他讲完课就拿起笔记本到处找人问，再把向大家学来的东西对正机械原理，作出活生生的教材。大家学的时候特别起劲，上课铃一响，大家都赶紧的往课堂里跑，生怕迟到少学东西。
