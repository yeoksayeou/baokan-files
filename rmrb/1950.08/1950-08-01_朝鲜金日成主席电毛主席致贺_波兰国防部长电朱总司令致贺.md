Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: Chairman Mao Zedong received a congratulatory telegram from Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the Military Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The telegram reads as follows:

To His Excellency Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central People's Government of The People's Republic of China and Chairman of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission:

On the occasion of the glorious 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, I, on behalf of the Korean people and the Korean People's Army, extend warm congratulations to Your Excellency and, through Your Excellency, to all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the Chinese people.

The Chinese people have achieved complete liberation from the long-term aggression of the imperialists and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek. All the heroic deeds won by the true sons and daughters of the Chinese people—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—in the struggle to win the freedom and independence of the Chinese people and in the struggle to develop and enrich the new people's China and defend its territorial integrity, have further inspired and encouraged the Korean people and all the commanders and fighters of the Korean People's Army, who are now rising up to wage a just war for the complete unification and independence of their country, to eliminate the traitorous Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, and to oppose the barbaric armed intervention of the American imperialists.

The great achievements won by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all the Chinese people, as well as the Chinese people's firm struggle against the American imperialists' ambition to invade China's territory of Taiwan, combined with the struggle of the Korean people standing on the common front against American imperialist aggression, I believe, will certainly make a great contribution to the lasting peace of the world and the complete victory of the national liberation struggle in all of Asia, and further strengthen the strength of the world democratic camp. I further hope that Your Excellency, all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Chinese people will achieve new and brilliant successes in the struggles to come.

Kim Il-sung
Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the Military Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
July 30, 1950, in Pyongyang
