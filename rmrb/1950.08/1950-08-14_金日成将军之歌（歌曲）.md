　　Song of General Kim Il-sung

　　Explanation of "Song of General Kim Il-sung"

　　The "Song of General Kim Il-sung" had already become widely popular throughout Korea by 1946. On August 15, 1947, when North Korea held a literary and artistic works competition, this song won first prize.

　　The lyricist, Li Can, is a famous Korean poet; the composer, Kim Won-gyun, along with Zheng Lvcheng and Li Mianxiang, are three major Korean composers.

　　In northern Korea, the "Song of General Kim Il-sung" is as popular as the national anthem. In factories, mines, farms, the People's Army, and schools at all levels, men and women, young and old, sing this majestic and powerful song whether in meetings or during parades and demonstrations.

　　Before the outbreak of the Korean War, the "Song of General Kim Il-sung" was also popular in South Korea under the rule of the Syngman Rhee puppet government, though not openly. People's guerrillas sang it loudly during combat, and eight- and nine-year-old children secretly sang it under their blankets!

　　Now, this song, beloved by the Korean people, is being sung loudly everywhere not only in North Korea, but also in most areas of South Korea, by the broad masses of the Korean people.

　　金日成将军之歌
　　“金日成将军之歌”的说明
　　“金日成将军之歌”，一九四六年即已在朝鲜全境内普遍流行。一九四七年八月十五日，北朝鲜举行文学艺术作品比赛大会时，此歌曾荣获一等奖。
　　作词者李燦为朝鲜著名诗人；作曲者金元均，与郑律成和李冕相，为朝鲜三大作曲家。
　　在朝鲜北部，“金日成将军之歌”像国歌似地流行着。在工厂、矿场、农庄、人民军和各级学校里，无论男女老幼，无论在开会或举行游行示威，都唱着这一雄壮有力的歌曲。
　　这次朝鲜战争爆发前，在李承晚傀儡政府统治下的南朝鲜，“金日成将军之歌”也同样地流行，虽然不是公开的。人民游击队在作战时高声唱它，八九岁孩子们蒙着被子也偷偷地唱它！
　　现在，这一为朝鲜人民所喜爱的歌曲，不仅在北朝鲜，而且也在南朝鲜的铯大部分地区，被广大的朝鲜人民，到处用高昂的声音所歌唱了。
