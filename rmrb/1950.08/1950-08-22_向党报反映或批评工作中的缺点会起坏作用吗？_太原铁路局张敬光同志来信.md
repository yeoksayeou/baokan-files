　　Will Reflecting or Criticizing Shortcomings in Work to the Party Newspaper Have a Negative Effect?
    ——Letter from Comrade Zhang Jingguang of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau

To the Editor:
    I am a staff member of the General Affairs Department of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau and also a correspondent for the People's Daily. On the morning of the 9th of this month, at 10:00 AM, based on the July work summary of our department's Audit Section, I wrote an article about automobile fuel consumption standards, which included a paragraph stating: "The Audit Section of the General Affairs Department, in leading the work of automobile drivers, did not rely on workers to formulate fuel consumption standard plans, and there exists a bureaucratic approach that is divorced from reality." After finishing this article, I asked Comrade Shi Yanglan, the head of the section, to review it. After he read it, he said impatiently: "You can't say it's bureaucracy. If you write it like this, that our work has shortcomings is bureaucracy, then we won't dare to do any work." After speaking, he angrily threw the manuscript to Comrade Niu Huamin, the deputy section head, across from him. At this time, I said, "Our summary was written by you, and in the summary you admitted it was bureaucracy." He said, "It's okay for me to write it that way myself, but it's not okay to publish it in the newspaper!" Then Section Head Niu said, "This article will have a counter-effect." After speaking, he threw the manuscript on the table and went to a meeting with Section Head Shi. As they were leaving the office, Section Head Shi finally added, "It can't be published!" In this situation, I was extremely saddened. I think it's nothing to be rebuffed to my face, and it's okay if they don't agree to publish it, but why say it will have a "counter-effect"?
    Editor: I don't understand why one can criticize oneself, but not allow others to publish it in the newspaper? I believe that Section Head Shi's attitude towards the newspaper's correspondent is an attitude of suppressing criticism, which should be examined.

    Correspondent Zhang Jingguang

Editor's Note: According to Comrade Zhang Jingguang's report, the opinions he raised are correct. Reflecting or criticizing shortcomings in work to the Party newspaper will not only not have a "counter-effect," but on the contrary, it will play a positive role in promoting work. Comrade Shi Yanglan's thinking and statement are incorrect. This is a manifestation of not understanding the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instructions on carrying out criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, and it should be earnestly corrected in the future.

### 向党报反映或批评工作中的缺点会起坏作用吗？——太原铁路局张敬光同志来信

　　向党报反映或批评工作中的缺点会起坏作用吗？
    ——太原铁路局张敬光同志来信编辑同志：
    我是太原铁路局总务处的一个职员，也是人民日报的通讯员。我在本月九日上午十时，根据我处稽核课七月份的工作总结，写了一篇关于汽车耗油标准的稿子，其中有一段写着：“总务处稽核课在领导汽车司机工作上，没有依靠工人制订耗油标准计划，存在着脱离实际的官僚主义。”写完这篇稿子后，我就让该课课长石养澜同志去审查。他看完后，很不耐烦的说：“你不能说是官僚主义。照你这样写法，我们工作有缺点，就是官僚主义，那我们就不敢搞工作了。”说罢很生气的把稿子扔到他对面的副课长牛化民同志面前去了。这时我说：“咱们的总结是你写的，在总结上你就承认是官僚主义。”他说：“我自己那末写是可以的，拿到报上发表就不行！”接着牛课长说：“这个稿子会起反作用。”说罢，他把稿子扔在桌上，就和石课长去开会了。在他俩走出办公室时，石课长最后又说了一句：“不能发表！”在这种情况下，我真难过极了。我认为当面碰个钉子也没啥，不同意发表也可以，为什么说是“起反作用”呢？
    编辑同志：我不明白为什么自己可以检讨，而不许别人在报上发表呢？我认为石课长对待报社通讯员的态度，是一种压制批评的态度，是应该检讨的。
    通讯员  张敬光
    编者按：根据张敬光同志的报告，他提出的意见是正确的。向党报反映或批评工作中的缺点，不仅不会“起反作用”，相反地，它会起着推进工作的积极作用。石养澜同志的想法和说法是不对的，这是不了解党中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的指示的精神的表现，以后应当切实改正。
