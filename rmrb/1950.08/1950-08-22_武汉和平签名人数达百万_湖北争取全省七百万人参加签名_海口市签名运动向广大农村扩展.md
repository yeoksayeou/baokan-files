　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 21st. The number of people signing the Peace Declaration in Wuhan City has reached one million, and the campaigns in Hubei Province and Haikou City are continuing to expand.
    According to statistics from the Wuhan Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace on August 19th, the number of signatories in Wuhan City has reached 1,037,452, accounting for 93.8% of the city's total population. During the signature campaign, branches of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in various districts of Wuhan, as well as cinemas, newspapers, orphanages, and other organizations, spontaneously set up signature stations on the streets and docks. The First District of Hankou alone set up 33 signature stations. People flocked to the stations to sign every day. The Municipal Women's Federation mobilized 2,000 women to conduct publicity through home visits and lectures, collecting signatures from more than 17,500 people. Zeng Saizhu, a cadre of the Women's Federation, mobilized more than 3,000 people to sign. Cadres in the First District of Hankou first studied current affairs and then, together with the district's Support-the-Army and Give-Preference-to-Families-of-Revolutionary-Soldiers, Sanitation and Education Preparatory Committee and other organizations, formed a signature committee. The district was divided into 30 signature groups, and signature stations were set up throughout the district. Members of the signature committee then went to each group to conduct publicity in conjunction with the current work of epidemic prevention and distribution of relief grain, which led to the rapid development of the signature campaign. From late May to mid-June, all adults, young people, and children in the district signed the declaration.
    The number of peace signatures in Hubei Province has reached 2,373,363, accounting for approximately 10% of the province's population. The Hubei Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, in response to the call from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace to continue expanding the peace signature campaign, has decided to notify local people's organizations to continue their efforts to complete the glorious task of gathering signatures from seven million people across the province. The branch is currently printing enough Peace Declarations for seven million signatures, as well as a large number of publicity materials and popular wall posters, poems, and other publicity items.
    More than 51,200 people in Haikou City have signed the Peace Declaration, accounting for more than 50% of the city's population. The city's peace signature campaign is being carried out in conjunction with the movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. Ji Zhaoguang, a worker at the Electricity Bureau, after signing the declaration himself, used his spare time to mobilize more than 100 farmers in nearby rural areas to sign. Many workers also mobilized their families to sign. In response to the call from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, the peace signature campaign in Haikou is now striving to expand to the broad rural areas.

    【新华社汉口二十一日电】武汉市在和平宣言上签名的人已达百万人，湖北省及海口市正继续扩展中。
    据中国保卫世界和平大会委员会武汉分会八月十九日的统计，武汉全市签名人数已达一百零三万七千四百五十二人，占全市人口总数的百分之九十三点八。在签名运动中，武汉市各区中苏友好协会分支会、各电影院、报社和孤儿院等都自动地在街上、码头上普遍设立了签名站。仅汉口第一区设立的签名站即有三十三个。每日前往各站签名者络绎不绝。市妇联发动了二千名妇女，以家庭访问、讲演会等方式进行宣传，她们共征集了一万七千五百余人签名。妇联干部曾赛珠一个人就动员了三千多人签名。汉口第一区干部首先学习时事，并以该区拥军优属、卫生社教筹委会等机构联合组成签名委员会，把全区划分为三十个签名组，并普遍设立了签名站。签名委员会委员然后分赴各小组，结合当前防疫、发放救济粮等工作进行宣传，使签名运动得到迅速的发展。该区自五月下旬至六月中旬，所有成年人和青年及少年都签了名。
    湖北省的和平签名人数已达二百三十七万三千三百六十三人，约占全省人口百分之十。中国和大湖北省分会为响应中国保卫世界和平大会委员会关于继续扩大和平签名运动的号召，已决定通知各地人民团体继续努力，争取完成全省七百万人签名的光荣任务。该会现正印制足够七百万人签名的和平宣言和大批宣传资料及通俗墙画、诗歌等宣传品。
    海口市已有五万一千二百余人在和平宣言上签名，占全市人口百分之五十以上。该市的和平签名运动是结合着反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动进行的。电力局工人吉照光自己签名后，还利用空闲时间到附近农村发动了农民百余人签名。许多工人并发动自己家属签名。为响应中国和大的号召，海口的和平签名运动现正努力向广大农村扩展中。
