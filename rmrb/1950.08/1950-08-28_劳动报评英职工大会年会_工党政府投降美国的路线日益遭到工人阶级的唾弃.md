　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th: The Labor Daily published an article by Isakov on the 24th, commenting on the British Trades Union Congress's annual meeting scheduled to open on September 4th, stating: This conference will be held at a time of great significance for the British working class. Five years ago, when the British Labour government came to power, British workers had a great many illusions. Labour leaders used the empty talk of a characteristic "British socialism" to support these illusions. The workers, for the sake of socialism, were willing to bear many sacrifices, which were precisely what the capitalists – the true masters of Britain – needed.

　　Five years have passed, and the Labour government, executing the orders of the City of London and Wall Street, is desperately embarking on the road of arms races and new war preparations. The monopoly capitalist groups, through the infamous "wage freeze" policy, are carrying out a constant offensive against the living standards of the working people. In 1949, total profits reached an absurd height – nearly 3 billion pounds, prices were also skyrocketing, while workers' wages remained at their original levels and were frozen. In addition, workers gradually understand that the Labour Party only "nationalizes" those industrial and transportation sectors that do not generate high profits under British conditions and require unlimited investment. The people of the City of London still preside over those "nationalized" sectors, and the original owners profit greatly. British workers now know enough facts to conclude what the so-called "British socialism" is actually worth.

　　The recently announced Labour Party political program reveals that the Labour government will continue to lead Britain down the path of being dominated by gold-dollar imperialism, preparing for new wars, and intensifying reaction at home. However, the British working class is increasingly and resolutely rejecting this line. The Labour Party and trade union bureaucrats are responding to the rising discontent of the masses by persecuting progressive workers. However, no means of persecution can stop the profound change currently taking place in the working class. British workers are fighting for the unity of the international working class. In many drafts they have submitted to the upcoming annual meeting of the Trades Union Congress, they have expressed their dissatisfaction with the Labour Party's policies. This is the first time that British workers have expressed their dissatisfaction in such a broad and open way.

　　劳动报评英职工大会年会
    工党政府投降美国的路线日益遭到工人阶级的唾弃
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：劳动报二十四日登载伊萨科夫一文，评论定于九月四日开幕的英国职工大会的年会称：这次大会将在对英国工人阶级极有意义的时期举行。五年以前，当英国工党政府上台的时候，英国工人曾存有非常多的幻想。工党领袖们用特有的“英国的社会主义”的空谈来支持这种幻想。工人们为了社会主义的缘故愿意承受许多牺牲，而这些牺牲正是资本家们——英国真正的主人所需要的。
    五年过去了，工党政府执行伦敦城与华尔街的命令，拼命地走上军备竞赛与新战争准备的道路。垄断资本集团通过声名狼籍的“工资冻结”的政策，在对劳动人民的生活标准进行着经常的攻势。在一九四九年度，利润总额已达到荒唐的高度——将近三十亿镑，物价亦在飞涨，而工人工资却仍留在原有的水平而被冻结了。此外，工人们逐渐了解，工党只将那些在英国的条件之下并不产生厚利而需要无限投资的工业及运输部门“国有化”。伦敦城的人士仍旧主持那些“国有化”的部门，原来的主人大获其利。英国工人们现在已知道许多事实，足以得出结论，所谓“英国的社会主义”实际上有着什么价值。
    最近公布的工党政治纲领泄露出，工党政府今后还要使英国继续走着受金元帝国主义支配的道路、准备新战争并且在国内加紧反动的道路。然而，英国工人阶级日益坚决地唾弃这种路线。工党和工会官僚们用迫害进步工人来回答群众日益高涨的不满情绪，然而，任何迫害手段都不能阻止目前在工人阶级中发生着的一种深刻的变化。英国工人正为国际工人阶级的团结而奋斗。他们在向行将举行的职工大会年会提出的许多草案中，表示了他们对于工党政策的不满。英国工人以这种广大而公开的方式表示不满，这还是第一次。
