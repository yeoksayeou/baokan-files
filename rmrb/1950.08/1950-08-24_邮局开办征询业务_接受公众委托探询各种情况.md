Post Offices Launch Inquiry Service
Accepting Public Commissions to Inquire About Various Situations

The Beijing Postal Administration Bureau and its subordinate bureaus, upon instruction, will launch a "Inquiry" service starting August 22nd. They will accept public commissions to inquire about the following situations in places where post offices are already established nationwide: including the current status of relatives and friends, traffic conditions, cultural and educational situations, special products or commodity situations, and other simple and concise inquiry matters that do not involve national secrets. All of the above situations can be entrusted to the post office for investigation and inquiry.

When the public entrusts the post office to inquire, they must first obtain an inquiry form from the post office, fill it out according to the instructions, and pay two registered mail fees (currently 4,000 yuan). Each inquiry form should be filled out with one inquiry item as a principle, and should not exceed two items at most. If two questions are inquired at the same time, an additional registered mail fee must be charged. If there are urgent matters and the inquirer is willing to bear the telegram fee, inquiries can also be made by telegram.

The matters entrusted by the inquirer must be specific and based on simplicity. If they are vague or too complicated, the post office may not handle them. If legal issues arise from the matters inquired by the inquirer, the inquirer shall be responsible for them.

The inquiry and search for people services that the bureau has previously provided free of charge will be changed and charged according to regulations.

　　邮局开办征询业务
    接受公众委托探询各种情况
    北京邮政管理局及其所属各局奉令自八月二十二日起开办“征询”业务，接受公众委托，在全国已设有邮局的地方代为征询下列各种情况：包括亲友现状、交通情况、文化及教育情况，特产品或商品情况及其他不关国家保密的简单扼要征询事项。以上情况都可委托邮局代为调查探询。
    公众委托邮局征询时，须先向邮局索取征询单，依式填写，并缴纳两件挂号信资费（现为四千元）。每一征询单以填写一项征询事项为原则，至多不得超过二项。如同时征询两项问题者，须另加收一件挂号信资费。如有急要事项，征询人愿担负电报费者，也可用电报征询。
    征询人委托事项必须具体，并以简单为原则，如空泛或过于复杂者，邮局可不予代办。征询人所征询的事项，如发生法律问题时，由征询人自行负责。
    该局已往免费办理之查询及寻人事务，即行变更，一律按章收费。
