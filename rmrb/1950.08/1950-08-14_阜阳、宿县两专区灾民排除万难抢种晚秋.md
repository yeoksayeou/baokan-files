　　阜阳, Su County Special Districts' Flood Victims Overcome All Difficulties to Rush-Plant Late Autumn Crops

　　[Our Newspaper reports] According to the Wanbei Daily News: The flood victims in Fuyang and Su County Special Districts, the areas most severely affected by the Huai River flood, have begun a campaign to drain water and rush-plant late autumn crops after reversing pessimistic sentiments and resolving the seed shortage. In Linquan County, Fuyang Special District, most areas have drained and have been widely planted with late autumn crops; in areas that have not yet drained, drainage and replanting work are being carried out under the slogan of "drain one piece, plant one piece." In Fuyang Kouzi Collection area, under the slogan of "follow the water, plant with the water," more than 90 percent has been replanted. Taihe County has replanted 40 percent after all the water receded. Currently, counties in Fuyang Special District have replanted 60 percent of the submerged land, totaling more than 1,474,000 mu. In Su County Special District, Xiao County has rescued more than 277,200 mu of seedlings through intensive efforts to block breaches and dig drainage ditches.

　　In mobilizing flood victims to drain water and rush-plant, district and township governments in these two special districts universally convened cadre meetings, farmer representative meetings, and mass meetings to reverse the pessimistic and disappointed mood of the masses after the disaster; discussed methods for self-reliance through production; resolved the seed problem in rush-planting late autumn crops; and stabilized the confidence of flood victims in self-reliance through production by carefully calculating accounts and formulating plans. The disaster victim representatives in Anmiao Township, Hongshan District, Taihe County, proposed the slogan: "If you want to survive the famine, you have to engage in production. If you don't replant now, winter and spring will be even more difficult," and calculated the yield per mu of various late autumn crops, calling on the masses to replant. After careful calculation at the township cadre meeting in Lingbi Weiji District, it was clearly understood that if all the district's labor and plantable land were used for timely rush-planting, more than 15,8 million catties of grain could be earned. Township cadres unanimously believed that as long as production is carried out in a planned manner, the entire district can completely overcome the famine caused by this flood. Similarly, at the village meeting in Lulou Village, Suixi District, Su County, after poor peasant Lu Wuzhong reported his production plan, the masses in the entire village followed his example, carefully calculating accounts and formulating plans, dispelling their original intention to flee the famine.

　　The most difficult seed problem in rush-planting has been partially resolved. Cooperatives in Su County Special District have lent farmers 500,000 catties of mung bean seeds and 800,000 catties of buckwheat seeds. Cooperatives are still continuing to purchase and supply them. Fuyang Special District has also sent personnel to purchase seeds from other places; county cooperatives are vigorously providing services for this. However, there is a general shortage of seeds in various places after the disaster. In addition to government loans, free lending is encouraged, and flood victims are mobilized to earn money from sideline production to buy seeds.

### 阜阳、宿县两专区灾民排除万难抢种晚秋

　　阜阳、宿县两专区灾民排除万难抢种晚秋
    【本报讯】据皖北日报消息：此次淮河水灾中受灾最重的阜阳、宿县两专区的灾民，在扭转悲观情绪及解决种籽困难后，已展开排水抢种晚秋运动。阜阳专区的临泉县大部地区已出水，并已普遍种上了晚秋作物；未出水地区在“排一块，种一块”的口号下，进行排水补种工作。阜阳口孜集区在“跟水走，赶水种”的口号下，已补种百分之九十以上。太和县在水全落以后已补种百分之四十。现阜阳专区各县共已补种淹地百分之六十，计一百四十七万四千余亩。宿县专区的萧县，在紧张的抢堵挖沟排水下已抢救出禾苗二十七万七千二百余亩。
    该两专区在发动灾民进行排水抢种中，各区、乡政府普遍召开了干部会、农民代表会、群众会等，扭转了群众受灾后悲观失望的情绪；讨论了生产自救办法；解决了抢种晚秋中的种籽问题；通过算细账、订计划，稳定了灾民生产自救的信心。太和县洪山区安庙乡灾民代表会提出：“要想度荒年，只有搞生产。现在不补种，冬春更困难”的口号，并算出补种各种晚秋每亩可产若干，号召群众进行补种。灵璧韦集区乡干会议上经过精打细算，认识清楚如以全区劳力及可种土地及时抢种，可收入粮食一千五百八十余万斤。乡村干部一致认为只要有计划地进行生产，全区完全可以度过这次水灾造成的灾荒。又如宿县濉西区吕楼村的村民大会上，贫农吕武中报告了自己的生产计划后，全村群众在他的影响下，也纷纷进行算细账，订出计划，原来打算逃荒的也因此打消了原意。
    抢种中最困难的种籽问题，一部分已获得解决。宿县专区已由各合作社贷给农民绿豆种籽五十万斤、荞麦种籽八十万斤。现各合作社仍在继续收购供给。阜阳专区亦派员到外地购种；各县合作社正大力为此服务。但灾后各地普遍缺种，除政府贷给外，并提倡自由借贷和发动灾民从副业生产中赚钱买种籽。
