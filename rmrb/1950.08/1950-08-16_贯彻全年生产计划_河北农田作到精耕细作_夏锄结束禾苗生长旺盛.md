【Baoding News】Hebei Daily News: The summer weeding work in various parts of Hebei Province has come to an end. This year, in general, spring seedlings in various parts of the province were weeded three to four times, late seedlings three times, and cotton five to six times. Some districts and villages weeded spring seedlings five times, late seedlings four times, and cotton seven to eight times. Generally, weeding increased by one to two times compared to last year.

Since the beginning of summer, the special commissioner's offices and county governments in the province have actively led farmers in weeding seedlings to achieve increased production plans. Some special districts and counties have held meetings to formulate summer production plans centered on weeding and applying top dressing fertilizer to increase production. At the same time, they designated special personnel to be responsible for leading production and continuously sent people to inspect the summer weeding and wasteland elimination work.

The main shortcomings in this year's summer weeding are: when weeding late seedlings, it coincided with continuous rain. Some special districts and counties failed to combine it with flood prevention and summer grain requisition work, resulting in a relaxation of leadership in weeding work. For example, in some districts and villages in Tangshan, Cangxian, and Baoding special districts, the bad phenomenon of "grass and seedlings growing together" occurred. In Tianjin special district, Ninghe, Baxian and other eight counties and towns had more than 170,000 mu of wasteland with seedlings (including more than 100,000 mu that could not be weeded temporarily due to rain and wet land, 42,000 mu that were not weeded due to excessive labor for river engineering rescue, and 25,000 mu for the families of the elderly, widows, and disabled soldiers who lacked labor). Some counties and districts did not have enough understanding of "organizing" and technical guidance in weeding. After discovering the above-mentioned wasteland, the provincial leadership immediately allocated coarse grains in exchange for fine grains to support farmers in the above-mentioned areas to carry out weeding and production. Cangxian and Tianjin special districts allocated 3 million jin each, and Tangshan allocated 2.25 million jin. The Tianjin special district also sent special personnel to conduct on-site supervision and strengthen the production leadership organizations at all levels. By the end of July, the seedling wasteland had been basically eliminated. For example, in District One of Baxian County, taking advantage of the sunny weather, more than 11,000 men and women from 23 villages were mobilized, and they quickly weeded 30,000 mu of wasteland in two or three days.

Now it has entered the period of hanging up the weeding hoes. The seedlings are growing vigorously. As long as they are not flooded, a good autumn harvest is expected.

### 贯彻全年生产计划  河北农田作到精耕细作  夏锄结束禾苗生长旺盛

　　贯彻全年生产计划
    河北农田作到精耕细作
    夏锄结束禾苗生长旺盛
    【保定讯】河北日报消息：河北省各地夏锄工作已告结束。今年该省各地一般的春苗锄到三至四遍，晚苗三遍，棉花锄到五至六遍。有的区村春苗锄到五遍，晚苗锄到四遍，棉花锄到七至八遍。一般较去年增锄一至二遍。
    入夏以来，该省各专署和县区政府都积极领导农民锄苗，以实现增产计划。有的专区和县召开会议，制定以锄苗，施追肥为增产中心的夏季生产计划。同时确定专人负责领导生产，不断的派人检查夏锄灭荒工作。
    今年夏锄中的主要缺点是：锄晚苗时正当阴雨连绵，有的专区和县未能作到和防汛、夏征工作结合进行，致放松了领导锄苗工作。如唐山、沧县、保定等专区有的区村产生草苗“齐长的坏现象。天津专区宁河、霸县等八个县镇有苗荒地十七万余亩（内有因雨涝地湿一时不能锄的十万余亩，因河工抢险出人工多而未锄者四万二千亩，孤老烈军工属缺劳力的二万五千亩）。有的县区对“组织起来”的认识和锄苗中的技术指导不够。该省领导上自发觉上述荒地后，即拨以粗粮换细粮支持上述地区农民锄苗生产。沧县、天津两专区各拨发三百万斤，唐山拨发二百二十五万斤。天津专区并派专人实地督察，加强了各级生产领导组织。至七月底，苗荒地已基本消灭。如霸县一区三万亩荒地，趁晴天发动二十三个村男女群众一万一千多人，两三日内即很快锄完。
    现已进入挂锄期间，禾苗旺盛，只要不被水淹，秋收可望。
