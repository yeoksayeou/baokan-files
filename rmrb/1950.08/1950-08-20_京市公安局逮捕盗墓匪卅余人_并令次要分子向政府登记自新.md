　　Beijing Public Security Bureau Arrests Over Thirty Grave Robbers; Orders Minor Accomplices to Register with the Government and Turn Over a New Leaf
　　[This newspaper report] According to the Beijing News Agency: The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested over thirty grave robbers, including Sun Maotang, on the 16th. For years, these bandits have openly engaged in armed grave robbing in the suburbs of Beijing, colluding with bandits to commit robberies. Grave robber Sun Maotang began gathering accomplices and robbing graves with guns as early as 1937. Grave robber Deng Wanzeng, in addition to openly engaging in armed grave robbing, also committed multiple robberies and even beat and killed cart driver Wang Shangyu and seized Wang Shangyu's wife. Wang Yonghai and Yu Rui were both leaders among the grave robbers and notorious bullies, hated by the masses. After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government Public Security Bureau repeatedly educated these grave robbers, urging them to reform and turn over a new leaf, but a few incorrigible ringleaders still hid weapons and continued to engage in grave robbing and robbery activities. Last autumn, in Liangjiadian in the western suburbs, they openly gathered a crowd with guns and surrounded public security officers. In order to protect agricultural production and social order in the suburbs of Beijing, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested the ringleaders Sun Maotang, Han Wanzeng, Wang Yonghai, Yu Rui, and more than thirty others on the morning of the 16th of this month, seizing four hand grenades, one primitive gun, one musket, grave robbing tools, and dozens of pieces of stolen goods (jewelry and jade). The Public Security Bureau has ordered minor accomplices to register with the government, confess their history, hand over weapons and grave robbing tools, and repent, and the government has decided to treat them leniently.
　　The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau also issued a public notice, the original text of which is as follows:
　　"It has been more than a year since the liberation of Beijing, and social order has gradually stabilized. However, grave robbers in the suburbs, despite repeated punishment and education, are still incorrigible and continue their activities. In order to consolidate revolutionary order and social security, this bureau, in addition to arresting and bringing to justice the ringleaders who have ganged up, committed numerous crimes, and repeatedly refused to repent despite repeated warnings, now specifically stipulates that all those who have participated in grave robbing activities must immediately register with the local public security sub-bureau, hand over all weapons and all grave robbing tools, and repent. Those who refuse to register will be severely punished. This notice is hereby given to all."
