　　Cultural and Educational Briefs
    Under the assistance of the Xinjiang Branch of the Chinese Communist Party and the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government, and after active preparations by Mongolian journalists, Xinjiang Province's first Mongolian newspaper, the Mongolian version of the Xinjiang Daily, was officially launched in Dihua on August 1st. The newspaper is a broadsheet of two pages, tentatively published every Tuesday and Friday. The Mongolian people of Dihua were delighted and celebrated when they saw the publication of the newspaper in their own language for the first time.
    Cheng Yanqiu flew to Dihua on the 6th. Cheng will investigate and study the songs and dramas of various ethnic groups during this trip, and at the invitation of the Dihua City literary and art groups, assist in guiding the reform of old operas.
    In order to improve the cultural level of working-class, peasant women cadres, the Shandong Provincial People's Government established a women cadres school in March of this year. The school currently has 184 students, 70 percent of whom are from peasant backgrounds, and most of whom have three to five years of revolutionary history. The school curriculum is divided into cultural courses and professional courses. Cultural courses are divided into three levels: elementary, higher elementary, and junior high school. Professional courses are divided into three subjects: childcare, accounting, and hygiene. Women cadres with a higher elementary school education or above can study by subject. Because the students have experienced long-term practical struggle and are highly aware, they are eager to improve their cultural level, so their enthusiasm for learning is extremely high.
    The National Southwest People's Library was officially opened in Chongqing on the 7th. The predecessor of the library was the pseudo-Central Library (later renamed the Roosevelt Library), with a collection of more than 120,000 books. After the liberation of Chongqing, the library was taken over and reorganized by the people's government's cultural and educational organs, and new books and various newspapers and periodicals were purchased. In addition to regularly providing citizens with reading materials, the library will also collect Southwest literature, folk works, and literature related to ethnic minorities in border areas, in order to preserve and organize national cultural heritage. The library recently accepted 18,000 cultural relics donated by archaeologist Wei Juxian, and 30,000 books donated by elder Dai Liangji.
