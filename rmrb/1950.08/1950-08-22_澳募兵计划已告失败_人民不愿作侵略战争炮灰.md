　　Australian Conscription Plan Fails
    People Unwilling to Be Cannon Fodder in War of Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Sydney on the 19th via TASS] Despite the Australian ruling clique's every effort to pander to the American aggressors, their promise to send cannon fodder to oppose the Korean people clearly cannot be fulfilled. Australian newspapers report that the conscription movement has achieved nothing among the people. For example, in Victoria, the authorities originally planned to recruit 270 people in the state, but only 78 people registered. In Queensland, the recruitment results were even more pathetic. The newspapers pointed out that the government's hysterical appeals for Australia to participate in the criminal war in Korea have not received any sympathy from the people.

　　澳募兵计划已告失败
    人民不愿作侵略战争炮灰
    【新华社讯】塔斯社悉尼十九日电：尽管澳大利亚统治集团以一切努力来逢迎美国侵略者，然而应允为反对朝鲜人民而输送炮灰的诺言显然不能兑现。澳大利亚各报称：募兵运动在人民中间毫无成就。譬如，在维多利亚州，当局原拟在该州召募二百七十人，但只有七十八人登记。在昆士兰州，召募的成绩更为可怜。各报指出：政府为澳大利亚参加朝鲜罪恶战争所发出的歇斯底里的呼吁，在人民中间无论如何也得不到同情。
