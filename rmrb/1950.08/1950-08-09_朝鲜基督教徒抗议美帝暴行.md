　　Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: The Korean Central News Agency reported that Korean Christians are protesting against the American imperialists' armed aggression against Korea and the indiscriminate bombing of peaceful towns and villages. Pastor Kim Sang-il of the Shinyang-ri Church in Pyongyang said angrily: We Christians have recognized that the essence of the American imperialists' "humanitarianism" is nothing but a hypocritical means of concealing their bloody claws. We believers can no longer endure it. We know very well that without the freedom and independence of the motherland, there will be no freedom of belief for us. We are no longer the kind of Christians who held illusions about the "humanitarianism" of American imperialism in the past. We recognize that the American imperialists are not only the enemy of the Korean people, but also the public enemy of the people all over the world. Pastor Li Bi-de of the Qiukou-ri Church in Pyongyang said: We have lived a slave life for more than 40 years and know how precious the independence of the motherland is. The American imperialists instigated Li Chengwan to launch a civil war and then directly intervened by armed force, indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities and villages, and even wantonly bombing churches and cathedrals with crosses on them. Such robber-like barbaric acts, according to our Christian doctrine, are sins that should be cursed by all. We Christians must dedicate all our strength and, together with the people of the whole country, fight to eliminate American imperialist aggression from our motherland.

　　朝鲜基督教徒抗议美帝暴行
    【新华社讯】朝鲜中央通讯社五日报道：朝鲜基督教徒纷纷抗议美帝国主义武装侵略朝鲜与盲目轰炸和平城乡的暴行。平壤新阳里教会金相一牧师愤慨地说：我们基督教徒认清了美帝国主义者“人道主义”的本质，不过是掩盖其血腥魔掌的虚伪手段。我们教徒再也不能忍耐下去。我们非常了解，没有祖国的自由独立，就没有我们的信仰自由。我们已不是像过去对美帝国主义的“人道主义”抱着幻想的那种基督教徒。我们认清了美帝国主义者不仅是朝鲜人民的敌人，而且是全世界人民的公敌。平壤桥口里教会李弼得牧师说：我们已过了四十多年的奴隶生活，知道祖国的独立是何等宝贵。美帝国主义者唆使李承晚发动内战，进而直接武装干涉，盲目轰炸和平城市与农村，甚至对挂有十字架的教会圣堂，也滥肆轰炸。这种强盗般的野蛮行为，按我们基督教的教理来说，是要遭万人诅咒的罪恶。我们基督教徒，必须献出一切力量，和全国人民一起，为从我祖国领土上消灭美帝国主义的侵略而斗争。
