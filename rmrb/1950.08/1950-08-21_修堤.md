　　Repairing the Levee
　　Guo Renzhi
　　After much anticipation, the departure order finally arrived! The soldiers busied themselves with preparations. Comrade Ma Zhiyong, from the Sixth Squad, had checked his carrying poles, baskets, and shovels countless times – all prepared long ago. Challenges, oaths, and plans were enthusiastically organized. After dinner, they waited impatiently for darkness, and lying in bed, resented the long night. The soldiers seemed as excited and tense as before a battle.

　　Departure

　　The next day, as dawn broke, the troops set off. In the long column, stretching as far as the eye could see, some carried baskets, some shouldered shovels, some carried cooking utensils... each person carrying thirty or forty pounds of equipment. The soldiers marched with strong steps, heading eastward with great spirit. Joyful songs and laughter rose and fell along the way.

　　"Old Zhao, people say repairing the levee is hard work, but I'm not afraid. I can easily carry three or four loads with such a big basket." Ma Zhiyong, from the Sixth Squad, viewed carrying earth to repair the levee as easy.

　　"Don't brag! I believe that we've all participated in labor since we were young, and everyone is highly motivated, so we won't slack off when we work. But the baskets aren't small; even the smallest size, a number two basket, is bigger than the earth baskets used by the common people for repairing levees. When filled with earth, a load like that must weigh a hundred pounds or more. Don't think you're full of energy now; as time goes on, I'm afraid you’ll... "

　　"Afraid of what? Tell me!"

　　"Afraid you'll slack off later."

　　"Don't judge a book by its cover," Ma Zhiyong said with a displeased expression on his long, rectangular face.

　　"No, I'm not looking down on you," Old Zhao said tactfully. "I'm just saying that you, like a 'rash Zhang Fei,' are underestimating the situation."

　　The journey was long, a full hundred and twenty li. Everyone talked and laughed, so they traveled quickly. By the time the red sun climbed over the eastern mountaintop, more than twenty li had already been left behind. But later, the old saying, "It's not the weight of the load, but the length of the road that matters," proved true. Little Li, weighed down by his load, swayed back and forth like a "tumbler toy." Comrades vied to carry his load for him. But he stubbornly held on to the carrying pole, repeatedly saying, "No, no, I can still manage." After a while, Ma Zhiyong launched a surprise attack, suddenly snatching Little Li's load and turning back to say to Little Li, "Little Li, your vigilance is not high!" As he spoke, he carried the load and ran ahead. Little Li tried to "pursue," but was stopped by everyone.

　　Battle

　　On March 29th, the troops arrived at their destination. The next day, they went to the levee.

　　Standing on top of the levee and looking east and west, this uneven levee, covered with cracks, stretched far into the distance, disappearing into the forests and villages. To the north of the levee were endless fields and countless villages and houses; to the south was the Hutuo River. When the Hutuo River flooded, it inundated crops, collapsed houses, and brought painful disasters and starvation to the people beside the river. Now, the people's soldiers, under the command of Chairman Mao, came to repair the levee, confident that they could win this battle just as they had defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

　　Carrying earth began.

　　The soldiers, who had been raring to go, worked desperately. The wind in the early morning made the pores of their skin feel cold, but everyone seemed not to notice. They were wearing only thin pants and shirts, and their heads were steaming. Sweat the size of beans flowed down their necks. Ma Zhiyong's back was as if a basin of water had been poured over it; his shirt was soaking wet and clung tightly to his body.

　　"Carrying the load, walking like the wind, comrades following closely behind..."

　　Songs, shouts, the rustling sound of hoes digging earth, and the creaking sound of carrying poles mingled together.

　　Little Wang, the study group leader of the Fifth Squad, raised his voice and shouted: "Those carrying earth are truly excellent, carrying the loads like a gust of wind; you come and I go like shuttles, watching the levee slope grow higher. Those hoeing earth are not weak either, picking up their shovels and not straightening their backs; the earth pits get deeper and deeper, one cubic meter after another."

　　Just as they were working enthusiastically, "Di di da da..." the rest signal sounded.

　　"Old Ma, rest!"

　　"No, I'll do ten more loads of voluntary labor."

　　"Little Li, take a break, there are many days ahead..."

　　The two of them were competing, and no matter what was said, they would not stop working. After a while, all that was heard was "Creak, creak, crack," and Ma Zhiyong's carrying pole broke, and two full baskets of earth fell to the ground.

　　After the second work session began, Little Li hoed earth without straightening his back, but he still could not keep up with the two earth carriers. He became anxious, and without paying attention, he didn't put the shovel in the right position and stomped on it with force. "Crack!" The shovel broke.

　　They worked all day, expending a lot of energy; at night, after calculating, each person in the Sixth Squad averaged less than two and a half cubic meters of earth. All eleven members of the squad had blisters on their hands, and their shoulders were red and swollen. Two soldiers couldn't hold on any longer; once they lay down, they didn't even want to eat.

　　修堤
    郭仁之
    左盼右盼，出发的命令终于盼到啦。战士们忙着弄这弄那。老早就准备好了的担子、筐、铁锨，六班战士马志勇不知又看了多少回。挑战呀，宣誓呀，计划呀，搞得热火朝天。吃过晚饭盼天黑，睡在床上恨夜长，战士们好像进入战斗前一样的兴奋、紧张。
    出发
    第二天东方刚发白，部队就出发了。一眼看不见头，望不到尾的行列中，担筐的、扛锨的、背着做饭用具的，……个个人身上都背着三四十斤东西。战士们迈着健壮的步伐，雄赳赳地一直向东走着。一路上愉快的歌声，说笑声，起伏不停。
    “老赵，人们都说打堤是个重活，我可不怕。这么大的筐，我担三付、两付不成问题。”六班战士马志勇把担土修堤看得那么轻易。
    “你别吹牛啦！要说咱们从小都参加劳动，大家情绪又高，干起活来松不了，那我信。但是筐可不算小，顶小的是二号筐，那就比老百姓打堤用的那土篮大。装满了土，那付筐也得有个百八十斤。别看你现在劲头足，日子一长，就怕你……。”
    “怕什么呀？你说！”
    “就怕你后松。”
    “你别隔着门缝看人。”马志勇板起了长方形的大黑脸带气地说。
    “不，我可不是小看你。”老赵婉转地说：“是说你这个‘猛张飞’估计情况不足。”
    路途很远，足足有一百多里。大家说说笑笑，倒也走得很快。当红腾腾的太阳爬出东山尖的时候，二十多里路已落到背后啦。但是到了后来，就应了那句“不怕担子重，就怕道路长”的俗话了。小李被身上的担子压得东摆西晃的活像个“不倒翁”，同志们争着要替他担东西。可是他还硬抓住担子不撒手，一个劲儿说：“不，不，我还能坚持。”一会儿，马志勇来了个突然袭击，猛不防把小李的担子抢过去，还扭回头来对小李说：“小李，你的警惕性可不高啊！”说着，挑着担子就跑向头里去了。小李拔腿想“追击”，但被大家劝住了。
    战斗
    三月二十九日，部队到达目的地。第二天就上堤啦。
    站在堤顶上向东西两方望去，这条凹凸不平，身上满带裂缝的长堤，一直伸向远方，掩没在树林和村庄里。堤北是一望无际的良田和数不清的村落房屋；堤南边便是滹沱河。在滹沱河河水泛滥时，就把庄稼淹涝，把房屋冲塌，给河旁人民带来苦痛的灾荒和饥饿。现在，人民的战士奉了毛主席的命令来修堤，有把握有信心和打败蒋匪帮一样来取得这一战役的胜利。
    担土开始了。
    早就蹩足了劲的战士们，拼命干起来了。大清早的风儿直吹得汗毛眼发凉，但大家像是没有感觉到一样，都穿着单裤单褂，还满脑袋冒热气。豆粒大的汗珠子顺着脖子往下流。马志勇的脊背上像泼了一盆水似的，褂子水淋淋地紧贴在身上。
    “担起担儿走如飞，同志们在后面紧紧跟……。”
    歌声，喊声，沙沙的锄土声，格吱格吱的扁担声，混作一团。
    五班的学习组长小王子提高嗓子喊：“担土的，真是棒，担起担来像刮风；你来我往如穿梭，堤坡看着往上长。锄土的，也不弱，抄起铁锨不直腰；土坑一会比一会深，一方一方又一方。”
    正干得上劲，“的的哒哒……”休息号响了。
    “老马，休息了！”
    “不，我再来十挑义务工。”
    “小李，你息息吧，日子长着哩……。”
    他俩对上劲啦，怎么说也不停工。不一会，只听得“格吱，格吱，格差”一声，马志勇的扁担断了，满满两筐土都倒在地上。
    第二次开工后，小李不直腰的锄土，但是还供不上两个担土的。他急了，一没留神，锨没放正就猛力往上蹬，“差”一声，锨断了。
    干了一天，费的力气可不小；晚上算了算，六班每人平均还不上两方半土呢。全班十一个人个个手上打了泡，肩膀红肿肿。有两个战士支持不住了，一躺下连饭都不想吃。（待续）
