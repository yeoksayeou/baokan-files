　　Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Soviet Union's full exposure and criticism of the US crimes of aggression in Korea in the United Nations Security Council has made American newspapers anxious about the US's political defeat in the Security Council. According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 23rd, "General circles are increasingly concerned that the United States is losing the propaganda war in the Security Council." The dispatch quoted the opinion of American columnist Lawrence, pointing out that "many observers feel that Western countries have failed to launch a strong propaganda counterattack against the Soviet Union on many occasions." Lawrence is so anxious for his Wall Street masters that he so bluntly suggested that "the US and Britain should use propaganda techniques to make sharper and more powerful rebuttals."

　　苏联充分揭露美侵朝鲜罪行
    美在安理会上遭到政治失败
    美国报纸为此不胜焦急
    【新华社二十七日讯】苏联在联合国安全理事会中对美国侵略朝鲜罪行的充分揭露和抨击，已使美国报纸为美国在安理会中的政治上的失败而焦急。据国民党中央社二十三日华盛顿电称，“一般人士日益关切美国在安理会宣传战中吃败仗。”该电引美国专栏作家劳伦斯的意见，指出“许多观察家感到西方国家在许多场合下没有能够对苏联展开强有力的宣传还击”。劳伦斯是那样地为他的华尔街主人着急，以致如此直率地建议“美英应根据宣传技巧予以更尖锐而有力的驳斥”。
