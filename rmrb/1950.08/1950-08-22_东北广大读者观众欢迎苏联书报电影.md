Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th—Soviet books, newspapers, and films are warmly welcomed by the people of Northeast China. Many Soviet books and periodicals have become indispensable spiritual nourishment for the vast number of readers. The Shenyang branch of the Joint Publishing Company sold more than 155,000 copies of Soviet books from May last year to the beginning of August this year. From January to June this year, the Northeast General Branch of Xinhua Bookstore, in addition to directly purchasing tens of thousands of copies of books and periodicals from the Soviet Union, also translated 65 kinds, totaling more than 520,000 copies, which were distributed to various parts of Northeast China. The International Bookstore, which specializes in disseminating Soviet books and periodicals, has branches in Dalian, Harbin, and Shenyang. The Shenyang branch has more than 1,600 kinds of Russian books and periodicals (including some published in Eastern European democratic countries and a small number of English-language Soviet books and newspapers) and more than 20 kinds of Chinese-language Soviet books and periodicals. According to the July statistics of the Shenyang branch of the International Bookstore, the store sold more than 43,000 books, more than 40,000 magazines, more than 43,000 newspapers, and more than 12,000 portraits of great men and propaganda posters. Among them, the works of Lenin and Stalin were the best sellers. In order to meet the needs of their own business, many work units specially hired people to translate Soviet books related to the work of their departments. In order to be able to directly read Russian books and periodicals and timely absorb the construction experience of the Soviet Union, people from all walks of life in Northeast China are learning Russian in great numbers.
    Soviet films have a large audience in Northeast China. According to incomplete statistics, the audience for Soviet films in various places from January to June this year totaled more than 4.96 million people. Soviet films with Chinese dialogue are particularly popular with audiences. For example, when "The Battle of Stalingrad" was recently released, the audience reached more than 55,000 people in the first six days of its premiere in Harbin.

　　东北广大读者观众欢迎苏联书报电影
    【新华社沈阳二十日电】苏联书报、电影受到了东北人民的热烈欢迎。许多苏联的书刊已成为广大读者不可缺少的精神粮食。三联书店沈阳分店从去年五月至今年八月初旬止，即售出苏联书籍十五万五千余册。新华书店东北总分店自今年一月至六月，除从苏联直接购入数万册书刊外，还翻译了六十五种，共印行五十二万余册，发售到东北各地。专门担负传播苏联书刊工作的国际书店，在大连、哈尔滨、沈阳都设有分店，沈阳分店有一千六百余种俄文书刊（包括一部分东欧民主国家出版及少量英文版的苏联书报）和二十多种中文版的苏联书刊。据国际书店沈阳分店七月份的统计：该店曾售出书籍四万三千余册、杂志四万余册，报纸四万三千余份，伟人像、宣传画一万二千余份。其中以列宁、斯大林的著作销路最广。许多工作部门为了解决本身业务的需要，特请专人翻译与本部工作有关的苏联书籍。为使自己能直接阅读俄文书刊，及时吸取苏联的建设经验，东北各界人士学习俄文的极多。
    苏联电影在东北有着广大的观众。据不完全统计：从今年一月至六月间各地苏联电影片的观众共有四百九十六万余人，华语对白的苏联片，尤受观众欢迎。如最近公映的《斯大林格勒战役》，首次在哈尔滨上演时，六天内观众即达五万五千余人。
