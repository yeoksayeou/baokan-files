　　"The Soaring Soviet Union"
    By Ye. Shul, published by Popular Bookstore

    This is a book written in a light tone but with significant content. It analyzes the soaring Soviet Union from both vertical and horizontal perspectives, and includes many vivid statistical charts. These statistical charts, supplementing the text, concretely and powerfully depict the image of the Soviet Union advancing at an accelerated pace.

    It starts with "Unified Will" (the first chapter of the book). It provides an in-depth and simple explanation of the premise that "only our national economy can develop forward according to a unified plan and a unified will."

    After that, it quickly moves on to the core of the book - Chapter Two: "Three Wars and Two Worlds" and Chapter Three: "The New Five-Year Plan," explaining how the Soviet people "accelerated their pace" after the revolution, taking "their own path," using "their own strength" and "their own raw materials" to create "two worlds" that were completely different from before the revolution, and continuing to "embark on the road to prosperity." Various statistical charts appear in these two chapters, pointing out that these achievements "would take the world an average of more than 100 years, except for the Soviet Union, and the United States, which has the fastest economic development, would also take more than 80 years. The Soviet Union's completion of this journey was a rapid leap forward - from 1928 to 1940. Stalin's speed shortened 100 years to 13 years." And the new five-year plan is "an important stage in moving towards true prosperity and embarking on the road to material abundance, which will fully meet the needs of all the Soviet people."

    All these amazing victories are the result of "The Combination of Science and Labor" (Chapter Four of the book), the result of the collective efforts of scientific experts, technical talents, and the working masses. "Their creative friendship is a guarantee of new successes." "Replacing hard physical labor with machines" is the first step; "Replacing ordinary machines with automatons as much as possible" is the second step; "Then combining individual automatons into an automated system - 'complete automation': This is the path of technological development in our country."

    This path makes "a real 'century of wealth' highly possible." But what about in capitalist countries? "In this mad world, a good harvest leads to hunger, technological progress leads to poverty, and material abundance leads to destruction." Hysterical bourgeois scholars even cry out: "Put chains on the man-eating machine and strangle science." In the final chapter of the book, "The Competition Between Two Worlds," it profoundly points out the fundamental differences between the two worlds. "The old world fears the future. Our new world welcomes the future and approaches it." "The future belongs to us!"

    "We are confident that we will create a new world aspired to by the outstanding people of all mankind." Don't we, the people of New China, also have such confidence? This book shows the Soviet people's path and confidence and will help the Chinese people, who want to follow the Soviet people's path, to create the same new world.

　　《飞跃中的苏联》
    耶·叔尔著大众书店版
    这是一本笔调很轻松，内容很有分量的一本书。它就飞跃中的苏联，作了纵横两方面的剖析，并附有很多幅生动的统计图表。这些统计图表辅助着书中文字，具体而有力地刻划出怎样加速步伐前进着的苏联图景。
    它从《统一的意志》（本书第一章）出发。就“只有我们的国民经济能依照统一的计划和统一的意志向前发展”这一前提，作了深入浅出的说明。
    之后，迅速转入到全书重点——第二章：《三次战争与两个世界》和第三章：《新五年计划》，说明了苏联人民在革命后“怎样加快速度”，走“自己的道路”，用“自己的力量”和“自己的原料”，缔造了与革命前绝不相同的“两个世界”，继续“走上富裕之道”。各式各样的统计图表出现在这两章，指出那些成就“除苏联外，全世界平均需时一百年以上，经济发展最速的美国也需时八十年以上。苏联跑完这段道路，真是突飞猛进，——自一九二八年——一九四○年。斯大林的速度把一百年缩短为十三年。”而新的五年计划——“走向真正繁荣、走上物产富裕之道的重要阶段，将完全满足苏联全体人民的需要。”
    所有这些惊人的胜利是《科学与劳动的结合》（本书第四章）的成果，是科学专家、技术人才和劳动大众的集体努力的成果。“他们创造性的友谊——新的成功的保证。”“以机器代替辛苦的体力劳动”，这是第一步；“尽量把自动机去代替普通机器”，这是第二步；“以后再把个别的自动机并成自动机联合制的——“全面自动化”：“这是我们国家技术发展的道路”。
    这一条道路，使“真正的‘富裕世纪’已大有可能”。可是在资本主义的国家呢？“在这疯狂的世界上，丰收引来饥饿，技术进步引来贫乏，物品富裕引来毁灭。”患着歇斯底里症的资产阶级学者们甚至高叫：“把吃人的机器加上锁链，绞死科学。”在全书最后一章：《二个世界的竞赛》中，深刻指出了两个世界的基本分歧。“旧的世界怕将来。我们的新世界迎接未来和走近它。”“将来属于我们！”
    “我们确信将创造全人类优秀人民所企望的新世界。”我们新中国人民不也有这样的确信吗？这本书表明了苏联人的道路与信心，将帮助要走苏联人道路的中国人民去创造同样的新世界。
