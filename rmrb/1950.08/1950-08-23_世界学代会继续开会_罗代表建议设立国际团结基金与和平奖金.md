Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 20th: The Second World Student Congress continued its meeting on the 19th. The work of the conference increasingly demonstrates the indomitable will of students worldwide to defend peace.

The Cuban student delegate, Guevara, delivered a speech at the congress, recounting the struggles of Cuban youth and students against the attempts of American imperialism to exploit the Cuban people for its aggressive purposes. Guevara said that Cuban students actively participated in the worldwide movement of solidarity with the Korean people. The youth of Cuba will never shed a drop of blood for the war against the Korean people.

The Hungarian delegate, Szabo, urged the International Student Union to fight more resolutely for peace and to begin effective preparations for the Second World Peace Congress. The Romanian delegate, Gornia, suggested establishing a new international solidarity fund to aid students in colonial and semi-colonial countries, and establishing a peace prize to be awarded to the most outstanding young writers and artists who promote peace ideas.

The Iranian student delegate, Badani, in his speech, contrasted the favorable conditions enjoyed by students in Soviet Azerbaijan with the appalling conditions of life and study faced by students in Iranian Azerbaijan and throughout Iran.

At the afternoon session on the 19th, Dabo Seye, Secretary-General of the African Democratic League, addressed the delegates as a guest, offering his congratulations.
