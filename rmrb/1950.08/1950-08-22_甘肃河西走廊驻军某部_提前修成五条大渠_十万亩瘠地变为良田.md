Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, August 20th: A garrison unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province completed the construction of five large canals between Gulang and Jiuquan by the end of July, one to two months ahead of schedule. The main canals alone total 160 li in length, turning more than 100,000 mu of barren land into fertile fields. It is estimated that wheat production can be increased by more than 124,000 shi.

The Hexi Corridor is arid and windy, with an average annual rainfall of only 100 millimeters. Farmland mainly relies on snowmelt from the Qilian Mountains for irrigation. In the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang bandits, due to shoddy construction and cutting corners, the canal projects were crude and lacked water storage facilities. A large amount of water seeped into the ground, and the landlord power-holders monopolized water resources, causing most of the farmers' fields to become barren due to lack of water. After liberation, under the leadership of the Hexi Water Conservancy Committee, the People's Liberation Army began construction of the Shandan Touba, the Linze Shahepu underground water diversion projects, the Gulang Gufeng Canal, and the Jiuquan Bianwan and Gaotai Sanqing Canals, and dug the Wuwei Huangyang Canal, using a total of 350,000 workdays and excavating 240,000 cubic meters of earth. In the process of building the canals, the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, with unparalleled enthusiasm and initiative, overcame all difficulties, weaving their own soil baskets, making iron and wooden tools, and burning lime. Under the slogan of "everyone thinks of a way," they displayed creativity and improved various tools. The sand screening tool was improved five times, increasing work efficiency fourfold. The amount of earth excavated per person also increased due to improvements in technology and tools, enabling the plan to be completed victoriously ahead of schedule.

When the spring water of the Shandan Touba, which had been dry for twenty-four years, flowed out steadily after the People's Liberation Army's twenty-odd days of hard work, the people within more than fifty li around, supporting the old and carrying the young, drove their donkeys to see the spring water, continuously for twenty-odd days, warmly celebrating the successful completion of this water conservancy project for the benefit of the people by the People's Liberation Army.

　　甘肃河西走廊驻军某部
    提前修成五条大渠
    十万亩瘠地变为良田
    【新华社西安二十日电】人民解放军甘肃河西走廊驻军某部，于七月底提前一个月到两个月完成了古浪至酒泉千里间五条大渠的修建工程。这五条水渠中仅干渠即长达一百六十里，使十万多亩贫瘠之地变为良田，预计可增产小麦达十二万四千余市石。
    河西走廊高旱多风，每年平均雨量仅一百公厘，农田主要依靠祁连山雪水灌溉。在过去国民党匪帮统治时期，因修建时偷工减料，水渠工程简陋不堪，缺乏蓄水设备，大量水分均渗透地下，加以地主当权派霸占水利，农民田地大部皆因缺水而荒芜。解放后，人民解放军在河西水利委员会领导下开始修建山丹头坝、临泽沙河堡地下引水工程，古浪古丰渠和酒泉边湾与高台三青渠，并开凿了武威黄羊渠，共用工三十五万个，挖土二十四万立方。在修建水渠过程中，解放军指战员们始终以无比的热情和积极性，克服一切困难，自己编土筐、制铁木工具和烧石灰，并在人人想办法的口号下，发挥了创造精神，改进了各种工具。筛沙工具经过五次改进，提高工作效率四倍。每人挖土量亦因技术和工具的改进而提高，使计划能提前胜利完成。
    当山丹头坝干涸了二十四年的泉水经解放军二十几天的努力挖掘而源源流出后，周围五十多里的人民，扶老携幼，赶着毛驴来看泉水，二十几天络绎不绝，热烈庆祝人民解放军为民兴利的这一水利工程的胜利完成。
