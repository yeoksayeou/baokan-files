Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 6th—Inner Mongolia's forestry is gradually returning to normal. In the past year, there have also been significant improvements in the area's forestry logging, transportation, and management. The Inner Mongolia forest area is one of China's famous forest regions, covering an area of approximately 7 million hectares, accounting for one-sixth of the country's total forest area, with a reserve volume of 1,030,000,000 cubic meters. The trees are mostly conifers, with a firm and beautiful texture, and are important materials for industrial use.

In the past, this forest area suffered long-term damage from Japanese invaders. Only after the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Forestry Bureau at the beginning of last year did planned logging and transportation work begin. Last year, the area completed 102 percent of its original plan for logging. The winter logging task, originally set at 400,000 cubic meters, was completed by the end of March, reaching 106 percent of the plan. The amount of logging per worker has increased from an average of eight railway sleepers per day before liberation to twenty. The height of tree stumps has also been reduced by an average of 40 centimeters compared to before liberation. By mid-May this year, 98 percent of the transportation task had been completed, exceeding the rate of the same period last year. The amount of waterway transportation per worker has also increased from an average of 3.45 cubic meters per day to 7 cubic meters. Fire prevention and forest protection work has also improved.

However, there are still many shortcomings in Inner Mongolia's forestry production. First of all, there is still bureaucracy in the leadership, and some forestry cadres have never been to the forest farms. Some logging and transportation work still shows unplanned blindness. The policy of enterprise management in production has not yet been implemented, and waste is still quite serious. To date, forestry union members account for only a little over 14 percent of the total number of workers (more than 11,000), showing a tendency towards closed-doorism.

In response to the above situation, the Industry and Commerce Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Government has taken measures to further improve the production management and guidance of forestry, and earnestly implement the policy of democratic management and enterprise management. The department also convened a forestry labor model conference in Ulanhot in mid-June to widely exchange production experiences and discuss issues of rationalizing operations.

　　内蒙林业渐趋正轨
    现正进一步改进生产管理和指导
    【新华社张家口六日电】内蒙林业已渐趋正轨。一年来，该地区林业的采伐、搬运与经营管理工作亦有显著改进。内蒙林区是我国著名林区之一，面积约达七百余万公顷，占全国森林总面积六分之一。蓄积量为十亿零三十余万方公尺。林木多针叶松，质地坚美，是工业用的重要材料。
    该林区过去曾遭受日寇长期破坏，去年初内蒙林务局成立后，才开始有计划地经营采伐、搬运工作。该区去年采伐林木共完成原计划的百分之一百零二。今年冬采任务原定为四十万方米，三月底即已完成计划的百分之一百零六。每个工人的采伐量，已由解放前每日平均破八根枕木，提高到二十根。伐根也比解放前平均减低了四十公分。今年的搬运任务至五月中旬已完成百分之九十八，超过去年同期的比率。每个工人的水道搬运量，也由每日平均三点四五立方米，提高到七立方米。防火护林工作也有改进。
    但是，内蒙林业生产还存在许多缺点。首先是领导上还存在官僚主义作风，部分林业干部从未到过林场；有些采伐和搬运工作还表现着无计划的盲目现象；生产企业化的方针尚未贯彻，浪费现象还相当严重。林业工会会员至今只占总工人数（一万一千余人）的百分之十四强，存在着关门主义的倾向。
    针对以上情况，内蒙自治区政府工商部已采取措施，进一步改进林业的生产管理和指导，认真实现民主管理和经营企业化方针。该部并于六月中旬在乌兰浩特召开了林业劳模大会，广泛交流生产经验，并讨论了经营合理化问题。
