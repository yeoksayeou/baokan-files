Xinhua News Agency, August 27th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government sent a telegram on the 26th to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, and requested that it be forwarded to UNICEF Executive Board Chairman Maurice Pate and Director-General Ludwik Rajchman, notifying them that China has appointed Wu Yunfu as its representative to the Executive Board; the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group must be expelled from the Executive Board and all its affiliated institutions and meetings. The telegram reads as follows: Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lake Success, New York, and please forward to Dr. Ludwik Rajchman, Chairman of the Executive Board of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, and Mr. Maurice Pate, Director-General:

　　The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the Chinese people. I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, formally notify you that the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group are now completely unqualified to participate in the Executive Board of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund and must be expelled from the Executive Board and all its affiliated institutions and meetings. I also notify you that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Wu Yunfu as its representative to the Executive Board of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. I must solemnly point out that the agencies and personnel sent by the Executive Board of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund to work in the Liberated Areas of China have not strictly adhered to the principle of respecting our country's sovereignty, have repeatedly violated the understanding reached between them and the relief organizations in our Liberated Areas, and have not truly carried out their relief tasks. Even the extremely unreasonable allocation of materials at that time has not yet been completed. This situation must be corrected. Please acknowledge receipt and reply, and inform the Executive Board of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund and all relevant parties accordingly.

The telegram reads as follows: Mr. Leon Mulatier, Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union, Geneva:

　　On March 29th of this year, I sent a telegram to Dr. Ernest, the former Secretary-General of the International Telecommunication Union, pointing out that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the Chinese people, and that the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group are no longer qualified to participate in the International Telecommunication Union. I also notified that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Li Qiang, Director of the Telecommunications Administration of my Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, as the chief representative to the International Telecommunication Union. Now that the fifth session of the Administrative Council of the International Telecommunication Union will be held in Geneva on September 1st, I again notify you that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Li Qiang as the Chinese Director to the Administrative Council of the International Telecommunication Union and Zong Zhifa as Advisor; the so-called "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant group must be expelled from all institutions and meetings of the International Telecommunication Union. Please acknowledge receipt and reply, and notify the International Telecommunication Union and all relevant parties accordingly.
