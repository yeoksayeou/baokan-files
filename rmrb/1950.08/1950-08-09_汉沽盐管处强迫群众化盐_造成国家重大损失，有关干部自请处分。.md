　　Hangu Salt Management Office Forces the Public to Dissolve Salt
    Causing Major National Losses; Relevant Cadres Request Punishment. To the Editor:
    The Hangu Salt Field Management Office, under the Changlu Salt Affairs Bureau, has serious bureaucratic and commandist work styles, blindly emphasizing improving salt quality, and forcing the public to dissolve the produced salt, causing major national losses. The Hangu Salt Field in the Changlu Salt Area has historically produced "light weight, good quality" salt. This year, after the bureau called on salt producers to improve salt quality, many cadres blindly emphasized improving quality, requiring the salt quality to be raised to above 93% sodium chloride content, without considering that excessive rainfall last year reduced the salt content of seawater, so few met the required standards. However, most were around 85% sodium chloride content (according to the Salt Management Bureau's regulations, 75% sodium chloride content is合格 - qualified/acceptable). On May 12th, Comrade Zhang Wenrui, director of the Salt Management Office, went to the Xiaoshentang Branch Field under his jurisdiction to inspect work and believed that the salt samples submitted by each salt pan were not good. He told the cadres to selectively re-dissolve and re-produce some salt pans as a typical demonstration. On the 13th, the branch field held a production management committee meeting. Comrade Liu Runguo, director of the field, misinterpreted Comrade Zhang Wenrui's meaning and said, "All salt with less than 88% sodium chloride content must be dissolved!" and proposed a requirement to increase the salt quality to 96% sodium chloride. This made the salt producers (capitalists) at the meeting dissatisfied, and they immediately raised opposing opinions, but all were refused discussion.
    The next day, the salt quality evaluation and inspection team led by Comrade Liu Yunchang, head of the production section of the branch field, convened a joint meeting of production team leaders and technical workers in Shuangqiao Village. They announced: "All salt that is black in color and small in grain must be dissolved." This caused extreme dissatisfaction among both labor and capital, and they discussed it, saying: "Dissolve it, last year at this time, it was already piled up like a salt mountain; this year only produced this little, and still dissolve it!" The salt producers said: "If the salt is dissolved, we won't even be able to repay the grain borrowed from the public!" Many salt producers went to Branch Field Director Liu Runguo again, saying: "Let us keep the large grains and dissolve the small grains!" Liu resolutely refused. The workers were forced to carry the salt to the water to dissolve it, and they were slow and unwilling to do it. This year, the quota output of Salt Pan No. 156 is 6,000 packages (equivalent to 3 million jin), and 1,900 packages (equivalent to 950,000 jin) had been produced by the end of May. Liu Shuwang, who holds a shovel (referring to those who use their own technology to manage the beach for the capitalists), was unwilling to dissolve the salt. Shi Chonglian, a comrade from the production section of the Salt Management Office, said: "If you don't dissolve it today, we will come to check you tomorrow!" So they were forced to dissolve 488,000 jin.
    The Xiaoshentang Branch Field has consistently failed to pay attention to these correct opinions from the masses. They also did not analyze the situation or study appropriate solutions, and made haphazard decisions. They also failed to report to the leading organs afterward. It was not until Comrade Liu Runguo felt that too much had been dissolved that he ordered the salt dissolving to be stopped.
    According to statistics: from May 14th to 12:00 noon on May 15th, a total of 165,310 dan of salt were dissolved, resulting in a loss of national tax revenue equivalent to approximately 8,265,500 jin of rice. The income loss for the salt producers was equivalent to 826,550 jin of rice, for a total loss of 9,092,050 jin of rice.
    With the salt production season coming to an end, and the output only completing slightly more than one-tenth of the annual plan, the forced dissolving of salt (the dissolved salt generally contained more than 85% sodium chloride) greatly reduced the production enthusiasm of both workers and salt producers, and this loss is difficult to estimate. After discovering this matter, the Salt Management Office has organized cadres to apologize to the workers and salt producers separately. Zhang Wenrui, director of the Salt Management Office, and Liu Runguo, director of the Xiaoshentang Branch Field, have both separately requested punishment from the Party and the administration. Although the Hangu Town Party Committee and the Town People's Government also heard some dissatisfaction with this matter during the salt dissolving process, they did not promptly study and analyze or conduct in-depth understanding, demonstrating an insufficiently responsible attitude, and should also conduct a deep self-criticism.

    Editor's Note: Improving product quality should be done on the premise of maintaining a certain output. The purpose of improving product quality is to increase sales and further develop production under a certain output. According to the situation of the Hangu Salt Field reflected by Yang Qiuxiang and Han Ruyin, in the case of extremely low output, unilaterally improving quality and re-dissolving the already produced salt not only violates the principle of restoring and developing production but also damages the original production. And the cadres of the Hangu Salt Field Management Office disregarded the opinions of the masses and forcibly dissolved the already produced salt, causing great dissatisfaction among both labor and capital in the salt pans. This is the evil consequence caused by bureaucracy and commandism.

### 汉沽盐管处强迫群众化盐  造成国家重大损失，有关干部自请处分。

　　汉沽盐管处强迫群众化盐
    造成国家重大损失，有关干部自请处分。编者同志：
    长芦盐务管理局所属汉沽盐场管理处，存在严重的官僚主义命令主义作风，盲目强调提高盐质，强迫群众将制成的盐化掉，造成国家的重大损失。长芦盐区汉沽盐场，历年来产品是“重量轻质”。今年局方号召盐户要提高盐质后，许多干部就盲目地强调提高质量。要求把盐质提高到含氯化钠百分之九十三以上，而未注意到因去年雨水太多，使海水含盐量减少的情况，所以达到要求标准的很少。但一般的也都在含氯化钠百分之八十五上下（按盐管局规定含氯化钠百分之七十五即合格）。五月十二日，盐管处处长张文瑞同志赴该处所属小神堂分场检查工作，认为各盐滩交来的盐样不好，就告诉干部要重点地选些盐滩重新化掉再制，作为典型示范。十三日，该场召开了生产管理委员会会议，场主任刘润国同志曲解张文瑞同志的意思，竟说：“含氯化钠不足百分之八十八的就通统化掉！”并提出要求提高盐质含氯化钠为百分之九十六。这使得会议上的灶户（资方）都不满意，并当即提出了相反的意见，但均被拒绝讨论。
    第二天，该场生产股股长刘运昌同志领导的盐质评判检查组在双桥村召集生产小组长及技术工人联席会议。宣布：“凡是色黑粒小的都得化掉。”这使得劳资双方极端不满，议论纷纷地说：“化吧，去年这时候早堆的像盐山了；今年才产了这样一点，还化呢！”灶户则说：“化了盐，连借公家的粮食都还不起了！”不少的盐户又去找分场主任刘润国同志，说：“让我们把大粒留下，化小粒吧！”刘坚决不答应。工人被迫往水里抬盐去化，也都慢腾腾地不愿干。一五六号滩今年定额产量是六千包（合三百万斤），五月底已产出一千九百包（合九十五万斤）。抱锨的（按系以自己的技术替资方经营滩地的）刘树旺不愿化，盐管处生产股史重廉同志说：“今天不化，明天来查你们！”这样被迫就化了四十八万八千斤。
    对于群众这些正确意见，小神堂分场始终不予注意。他们更没有分析情况，研究妥当的处理办法，就胡乱的作出决定。事后也不反映给领导机关。直到刘润国同志感到化得太多了，才命令停止化盐。
    据统计：从五月十四日到五月十五日中午十二时，共化了十六万五千三百十担盐，损失国家税收折米约八百二十六万五千五百斤。灶户收入损失折米八十二万六千五百五十斤，共损失九百零九万二千零五十斤米。
    在产盐季节将过，而产量仅完成全年计划十分之一强的情况下，竟强迫群众化盐（所化的盐一般都含有氯化钠百分之八十五以上）使得工人、灶户双方的生产情绪大为降低，这种损失是很难估计的。盐管处发觉此事后，已组织干部分别向工人、灶户进行了认错道歉。盐管处张文瑞处长及小神堂分场主任刘润国同志均已分别向党和行政自请处分。中共汉沽镇委和镇人民政府在化盐过程中虽也听到了一些对此事不满的反映，但没有及时研究分析或深入了解，表现了不够负责的态度，也应作深刻检讨。

    编者按：提高产品质量，应该是在保持一定的产量的前提下来提高。提高产品质量的目的，是为了在一定的产量下增加销路，进一步发展生产。根据杨秋祥、韩汝荫所反映的汉沽盐场的情况，在产量尚极度低下的情形下，片面提高质量，而且将已经制成的盐粒重行化掉，这不仅违反恢复和发展生产的原则，而且使原有的生产受到破坏。而汉沽盐场管理处干部不顾群众的意见，强将已制成的盐粒化掉，引起盐滩劳资双方极大不满。这是官僚主义、命令主义所造成的恶果。
