To the Editor:

The criticism by Comrade Sun Jichang published on June 23rd in the People's Garden regarding the serious shortcomings of our factory in uniting with technical personnel is basically factual. It is true that the general cadres in our factory have serious complacency and arrogance, and their understanding of uniting with technical personnel is very vague. They thought that with the national victory and the enterprise of the factory, technical personnel are no longer as lacking as before. (Editor's note: In terms of the nation's overall economic construction work, technical personnel are still very scarce.) Therefore, they held an erroneous attitude of "welcoming those who come, sending off those who leave," and did not adopt the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming.

Since last year, a total of twenty-two technical personnel have come to the factory, and eight have left successively due to dissatisfaction with their work and objections to their treatment. Most of them have opinions about the factory's work in uniting with technical personnel.

The leadership does not pay enough attention to the newly arrived technical personnel, and has not established close contact with them in their work. At the same time, it has committed the error of egalitarianism in wage issues. The treatment of staff and some technical personnel (including skilled workers) is relatively low, resulting in financial difficulties for some technical personnel's families, which cannot be properly resolved. When they cannot solve some technical problems, the management personnel think: "They are no good, they only know dogmatism!" Seeing individual technical personnel with more shortcomings, they consider them backward and do not patiently persuade and educate them.

In the factory, the division of labor is not clear. Some technical personnel have been here for a long time and have not yet been assigned positions, and workers call them "college students." This has created incoordination in the work.

The leading comrades do not pay enough attention to some suggestions made by technical personnel and fail to adopt and answer them in a timely manner. They do not understand the situation and do not correct deviations in time, so the production enthusiasm of technical personnel cannot be well developed. In order to correct the above deviations, we have decided to immediately determine the job responsibilities of technical personnel. According to the original plan, we will make reasonable adjustments to the treatment of technical personnel based on their work ability. We will establish a technical research association to strengthen the unity of technical personnel and improve their political and professional level, so that they can give full play to their work enthusiasm. Combined with work inspection, all comrades in the factory will study the Northeast Bureau's instructions on further uniting technical personnel and staff in public enterprises, and improve their work. Each unit will also make specific plans for uniting technical personnel in the future. Technical personnel symposiums will be held regularly to listen to their opinions and study and deal with them in a timely manner.

### 山东新华制药厂  技术人员纷纷离去事件  该厂来信答复正在纠正中

    技术人员纷纷离去事件
    该厂来信答复正在纠正中编辑同志：
    六月二十三日人民园地上刊载孙纪昌同志批评本厂在团结技术人员上存在严重的缺点，基本上是符合事实的。本厂一般干部确是存在着严重的功臣思想与骄傲自满情绪，对团结技术人员的认识很模糊。以为全国胜利了，工厂企业化了，技术人员已不像从前那样缺少。（编者按：就国家整个经济建设工作来说，技术人员还非常缺乏。）因此便抱着一种“来者欢迎、去者欢送”的错误态度，没有采取团结、教育改造的方针。
    自去年到现在，来厂技术人员共二十二人，因对工作不满，对待遇有意见，曾先后走了八名。他们大部分对工厂在团结技术人员方面有意见。
    领导上对新来技术人员不够重视，在工作上没有和他们取得密切的联系。同时在工资问题上犯了平均主义的错误，职员与某些技术人员（技术工人在内）待遇较低，以致部分技术人员的家庭困难，得不到适当的解决。他们在技术方面有些问题不能解决时，管理人员就认为：“人家不行，只懂教条！”看到个别缺点较多的技术人员就认为落后，不耐心说服教育。
    工厂中，分工不明确，有些技术人员来了很久，还没有确定职务，工人就称他们为“大学生”。因此造成了工作上的不协调。
    领导同志对技术人员所提出的某些建议，重视不够，未能及时采纳与解答。不了解情况，不及时纠正偏差，因此使技术人员的生产积极性不能很好的发挥。为了纠正上述的偏向，我们决定立即确定技术人员的工作职责。按原定计划，根据工作能力将技术人员的待遇，作合理的调整。成立技术研究会，加强团结技术人员，以提高他们的政治、业务水平，使他们得以发挥工作积极性。结合工作检查，全厂同志进行学习东北局关于进一步团结公营企业中技术人员与职员的指示，改进工作。各单位并作出今后团结技术人员的具体计划。按期召开技术人员座谈会，倾听他们的意见，及时加以研究与处理。
