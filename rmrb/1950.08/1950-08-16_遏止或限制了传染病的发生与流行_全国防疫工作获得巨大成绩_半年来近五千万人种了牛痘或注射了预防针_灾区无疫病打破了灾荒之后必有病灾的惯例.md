Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has vigorously promoted disease prevention work, achieving great success in the past six months. According to incomplete statistics: in the past six months, more than 36.54 million people in various regions have been vaccinated with cowpox, and more than 13.55 million people have been injected with cholera, typhoid, plague, diphtheria, and other vaccines; the Ministry and various regions have organized 63 various disease prevention teams, including more than 3,800 people, to go to various epidemic areas and disaster areas to work, and have carried out environmental sanitation work such as eliminating lice, catching rats, eliminating fleas, and improving drinking water, greatly curbing or limiting the occurrence and spread of infectious diseases.

The prevention and treatment of smallpox was the focus of disease prevention work this spring. Among the more than 30 million people who have been vaccinated with cowpox (the highest record during the Kuomintang reactionary government was 7 million), Hebei Province accounted for 8.15 million, and the occurrence of smallpox in the province has been reduced as a result. In Lushun and Dalian, because 90% of the population has been vaccinated, there has not been a single case of smallpox this year. In Beijing, due to early vaccination, the number of patients in the first five months of this year decreased from 190 to 11 compared with the same period last year, and the number of deaths decreased from 90 to 4.

In addition to the Northeast and eastern Inner Mongolia, where local health authorities are fully engaged in prevention and treatment, only 38 cases of plague occurred this year. The Leizhou Peninsula, Fujian, Wenzhou in Zhejiang, and Menghua in Yunnan successively experienced plague outbreaks. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government allocated vaccines and medicines, and dispatched teams to assist in prevention and treatment, all of which quickly suppressed the epidemic. Currently, the number of people vaccinated with plague vaccine is more than 4.55 million with live bacteria and more than 140,000 with killed bacteria.

Preventing the spread of cholera was the central task of the health departments of East China, Central South, and Southwest major administrative regions in the first half of the year. The work emphasized early detection of patients and early isolation and disinfection. More than 8.7 million people have been vaccinated with cholera, typhoid, or a mixed vaccine of both. In coordination with preventive vaccinations, various regions have also carried out work such as drinking water improvement, disinfection, and toilet improvement. No completely confirmed cases of true cholera have been found in various regions this year.

In order to prevent epidemics in disaster areas, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government established a general disease prevention team of nearly 500 people, which was divided into four brigades and sent to the Yellow River flood area and the seriously affected areas of northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, and Pingyuan to carry out disease prevention and medical work with a focus, and to assist in improving environmental sanitation. As a result, no epidemics prevailed in the disaster areas, changing the custom that disease must follow war and disaster, ensuring the health of the 800,000 migrant workers digging the river, and greatly helping the entire production and disaster relief effort.

Around the summer vacation, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government mobilized more than 170 professors, students from Peking University, Peking Union Medical College, and the National First Midwifery School, as well as doctors and nurses from Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Central People's Hospital, to organize mobile disease prevention teams to go to the countryside, respectively responsible for the health care of migrant workers in the Chaobai River water conservancy project and the prevention and treatment of measles in Yanggao, Yanbei, syphilis in Suimeng, and plague in Chahar-Suiyuan, all of which achieved significant results, and also enabled these medical personnel to transform themselves by going deep among the masses. For example, when measles broke out in Yanggao, there were 4,806 patients and 1,087 deaths, and the people of the county were in a state of unprecedented terror. After the disease prevention team arrived, after 35 days of prevention and treatment, the measles was completely eliminated, and only four people died because they were treated too late.

In addition, endemic diseases such as epidemic typhus, relapsing fever, kala-azar, and Japanese schistosomiasis have been appropriately prevented and treated in key areas, and BCG vaccination for the prevention of tuberculosis has begun to be promoted in major cities. In order to fully grasp the epidemic situation and prevent and treat it in a timely manner, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has established an epidemic notification system nationwide and publishes a "Epidemic Notification" weekly. In February, a national transportation quarantine conference was held to determine the direction for improving transportation quarantine work.

Six months of disease prevention experience have proved that the above-mentioned various infectious diseases can be completely prevented (previously, more than half of the annual deaths in the country were due to infectious diseases), but it is necessary to carry out key prevention in a timely and active manner for the infectious diseases that pose the greatest harm. Some infectious diseases are not difficult to prevent, such as vaccination, which can be done by rural women cadres, students, primary school teachers, and other cultural and educational workers after a little training; other disease prevention work can also be organized and trained by local Chinese medicine practitioners and mobilized by local Western medicine practitioners. Disease prevention is a large-scale mass work, and it is necessary to unite Chinese and Western medicine practitioners and cultural and educational and women cadres in various places, and mobilize the broad masses of the people to participate together. In the mobilization, it is necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity based on the needs of the masses, and to inspire the masses' voluntary participation, and never use coercive orders. Before health institutions are generally established in various places, the disease prevention team is the best organizational form, which can be mobilized to work in key epidemic areas, and can also organize people from all parties to participate in the work, and after the sudden disease prevention work, it can take root and sprout in the local area and establish local grass-roots health organizations.

In the future, disease prevention will become a larger-scale and regular work in the entire health construction. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has requested major administrative regions, provinces, and cities to include disease prevention work in administrative plans in light of the common endemic diseases in various places, and to establish disease prevention teams in a widespread manner in the short term. Various regions should set up training and research institutions for the prevention and treatment of plague, kala-azar, leprosy, malaria, and other diseases according to the distribution of epidemics, so as to carry out popular disease prevention work under the guidance of advanced technology. In addition to the establishment of a biological products appraisal institute by the Central Government, major administrative regions should establish or restore biological products work to produce a large number of disease prevention products. Transportation quarantine and epidemic notification work will also be further improved and strengthened. With the more effective development of disease prevention work, it will not be difficult for China to basically eliminate smallpox in coastal areas within three years; other infectious diseases may also be gradually eliminated within a certain period of time.

　　遏止或限制了传染病的发生与流行
    全国防疫工作获得巨大成绩
    半年来近五千万人种了牛痘或注射了预防针  灾区无疫病打破了灾荒之后必有病灾的惯例
    【新华社十一日讯】中央人民政府卫生部大力推行防疫工作，半年来获得巨大成绩。据不完全统计：各地半年来已有三千六百五十四万余人种了牛痘，一千三百五十五万余人分别注射了霍乱、伤寒、鼠疫、白喉等预防针；该部及各地组织了六十三个包括三千八百余人的各种防疫队、分赴各疫区、灾区工作，并进行了灭虱、捕鼠、灭蚤、饮水改善等环境卫生工作；大大地遏止或限制了传染病的发生与流行。
    防治天花是今年春季防疫工作的重点。在已种牛痘的三千多万人中（国民党反动政府时期最高纪录是七百万人），河北省占八百一十五万人，该省天花的发生因而减少。旅大由于种痘的占人口百分之九十，今年没有一个天花患者。北京因及早种痘，今年五个月和去年同时期相比，患者比去年从一百九十人减至十一人，死亡从九十人减至四人。
    鼠疫防治除东北、内蒙东部由当地卫生机关全力防治，今年只发生三十八名患者外，雷州半岛、福建、浙江温州、云南蒙化等地先后发生鼠疫，均经中央人民政府卫生部配发疫苗药品、派队前往协助防治，都已将疫情迅速抑止。现在各地已注射鼠疫预防针的人数计生菌注射四百五十五万余人，死菌注射十四万余人。
    防止霍乱流行是华东、中南、西南各大行政区卫生部上半年的中心工作，工作中强调早期发现病人，早期隔离消毒。各地已注射霍乱、伤寒或两者的混合预防针的已达八百七十余万人。配合预防注射，各地并进行了饮水改良、消毒和改良厕所等工作。今年各地还没有发现完全证实的真性霍乱。
    为防止灾区疫病，中央人民政府卫生部成立了近五百人的防疫总队，并编成四个大队分赴黄泛区及皖北、苏北、平原等重灾区有重点地进行防疫医疗工作，协助改善环境卫生。结果使在灾区没有疫病流行，改变了战争和灾荒之后必有病灾的惯例，保证了挖河的八十万民工的健康，对整个生产救灾起了很大的帮助作用。
    在暑期前后，中央人民政府卫生部发动北京大学、协和医学院、国立第一助产学校等校的教授、学生及协和医院、中央人民医院的医师、护士等一百七十余人，组织机动防疫队下乡，分别担任了潮白河水利工程民工保健和雁北阳高的麻疹、绥蒙的梅毒、察蒙的鼠疫等防治工作，都收到显著的效果，也使这些医务人员在深入群众中改造了自己。如阳高麻疹流行时患者四千八百零六人，死亡一千零八十七人，全县人民陷入空前恐怖状态。防疫队去后，经过三十五天的防治，即将麻疹完全消灭，只有四人因医治过晚死亡。
    此外如斑疹伤寒、回归热、黑热病、日本住血吸虫等流行病都在重点地区进行了适当的防治，并开始在各大城市推广预防结核病的卡介苗接种。中央人民政府卫生部为充分掌握疫情、及时防治，已在全国范围内建立了疫情通报制度，每周出版“疫情通报”。二月间曾召开全国交通检疫会议，确定了改进交通检疫工作的方针。
    半年的防疫工作经验证明：上述各种传染病完全是可以预防的（以前全国每年死亡人口死于传染病的在半数以上），但必须针对危害最大的传染病及时主动地进行重点预防。有的传染病预防起来并不困难，如种痘，乡村妇女干部、学生、小学教员及其他文教工作者，稍经训练就能作；其他防疫工作也可以在各地组织和训练中医和动员当地西医担任。防疫是规模庞大的群众性的工作，必须团结各地的中西医及文教、妇女干部并发动广大的人民群众共同参加。在动员中要根据群众的需要，进行广泛深入的宣传，启发群众的自愿，绝不可用强迫命令的办法。在目前各地卫生机构尚未普遍建立以前，防疫队是最好的组织形式，可以机动地到重点疫区工作，也可以组织各方人员参加工作，并在突击的防疫工作之后，即在当地生根发芽，建立地方的基层卫生组织。
    今后的防疫在整个卫生建设中将成为更大规模的经常性的工作。中央人民政府卫生部已要求各大行政区、各省市针对各地常发疫病，将防疫工作列入行政计划，在短期内将防疫队普遍建立起来。各地应按疫情分布，分别设立防治鼠疫、黑热病、麻疯、疟疾等病的训练、研究机构，以便在高级技术的指导之下进行普及的防疫工作。除中央将设立生物制品鉴定所外，各大行政区均应建立或恢复生物制品工作，以大量生产防疫用品。交通检疫和疫情通报工作也将更加改进和加强。随着防疫工作的更有效地展开，中国将不难在三年内基本消灭沿海各地的天花；其他的传染病也都可能在一定的时期内逐渐消灭。
