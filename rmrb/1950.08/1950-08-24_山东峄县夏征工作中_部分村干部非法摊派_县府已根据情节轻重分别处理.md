　　Shandong Yixian County Summer Grain Collection Work:
    Some Village Cadres Illegally Levied Apportionments
    County Government Has Handled Cases According to the Seriousness of the Circumstances
    [Our Newspaper] During this year's summer grain collection in Yixian County, Shandong, some village cadres engaged in illegal apportionments. The county government has dealt with these cases according to the seriousness of the circumstances. One of the main forms of apportionment was under the pretext of buying rain capes, shoes, and making ammunition pouches for the militia. For example, cadres in Daxinzhuang Village, Eighth District, levied one jin of wheat per mu under this pretext. Besides actually buying rain capes and shoes, they embezzled 200 jin. The village head of Niujiao Village in the same district also collected 300 jin of grain under the same pretext. Similar situations occurred in four villages in the Eighth District, two villages in the Third District, two villages in the First District, and one village in the Fifth District.

    Another method was that during the wheat harvest, village cadres trafficked in sickles and forced the masses to buy them at high prices. After the district authorities discovered this, the village cadres even claimed that the masses were buying them willingly. For example, Zhangdian and Liu Village in the First District, and four other villages, dispatched 70 sickles.

    Yet another method was to exploit the backward and superstitious weaknesses of some of the masses by collecting grain in the name of worshiping gods. This year, the county had timely rainfall, and some village cadres incited the masses to collect grain to "worship heaven." For example, the militia captain of Nan'ancheng Village in the Eighth District took the lead in collecting 340 jin. After spending some on buying paper, incense, and slaughtering pigs, each village cadre and militiaman divided 80 jin of grain.

    The fundamental reason for the above mistakes is that the leadership did not pay close attention to the ideological and policy education of village cadres, leading some village cadres to continue the bad habits of the Kuomintang Baojia personnel in the past. Secondly, the publicity and education for the masses were also insufficient. The policies of the People's Government were not understood by the masses, causing them to be deceived and coerced by some village cadres. Furthermore, the leadership's handling of similar problems in the past was not strict enough, indulging the mistakes of individual village cadres. For example, the Party branch secretary of Daxinzhuang Village in the Eighth District has illegally apportioned grain more than once, and when questioned by the district authorities, he retorted: "If you tell me to reflect, I will reflect; if you tell me to repent, I will repent; you can even dismiss me, but the grain has already been spent." In addition, impure village organizations are also one of the reasons. For example, the militia captain of Xingdian Village in the Fifth District, who took the lead in collecting grain, was a pseudo-Baozhang "returning home corps" member.

    In response to the above situation, the county government decided to carry out policy publicity and education among the masses throughout the county, so that after the masses understand the government's policies, they can play a supervisory role over the illegal apportionments of some village cadres. In addition, it will strengthen ideological leadership and policy education for cadres, and clearly point out in each stage of work: what to do, what to oppose, as the work discipline for cadres. Furthermore, for cadres who have made mistakes, the principle of education will be the main focus, and they will be dealt with differently. For cadres who have consistently performed well but made mistakes due to insufficient education, the focus will be on education. In addition to recovering the apportioned items and returning them to the masses, they will also conduct self-criticism at mass meetings. Those whose self-criticisms and reflections are relatively profound will generally not be given legal punishment. Those who are essentially bad and refuse to mend their ways after repeated education will, in addition to recovering the apportioned items and returning them to the masses, be sent to the court for legal punishment. For example, the militia captain of Xingdian Village has not only had his illegally apportioned items recovered and returned, but has also been removed from his post administratively and handed over to the court for labor service punishment. In making any punishment, attention is paid to the impact on the masses and cadres, in order to achieve the purpose of educating both the masses and the cadres. For the backward superstition of the masses, persuasive education methods are adopted, and it is strictly forbidden for anyone to carry out apportionments in the name of worshiping gods or any other means in the future.

### 山东峄县夏征工作中  部分村干部非法摊派  县府已根据情节轻重分别处理

　　山东峄县夏征工作中
    部分村干部非法摊派
    县府已根据情节轻重分别处理
    【本报讯】山东峄县今年夏征中，部分村干部曾有非法摊派现象，县府对此已根据情节轻重分别予以处理。摊派的主要形式之一是借口给民兵买蓑衣、买鞋、做子弹袋。如八区大新庄村干部，即以此每亩地摊派麦子一斤，除真正买蓑衣、鞋外，私吞二百斤；同区牛角村村长亦在同样借口下凑粮三百斤。类似上述情形的，八区共有四村，三区有两村，一区有两村，五区一村。
    又一种方式是在割麦时，村干部贩来镰刀，高价强迫群众购买。经区里发觉后，村干部尚说群众是自觉自愿。如一区张店、刘村等四个村，即派出七十把。
    再一种方式是利用部分群众落后迷信的弱点，以敬神为名敛粮。该县今年雨水及时，个别村干部即鼓动群众凑粮“敬天”。如八区南安城村民兵队长即领头凑了三百四十斤，除买纸、买香及杀猪花去一部分外，每个村干部和民兵却分了八十斤粮食。
    产生以上错误的根本原因，是领导上平时对村干部的思想、政策教育抓的不紧，致有些村干部沿袭了过去国民党保甲人员的恶劣作风。其次是对群众的宣传教育亦不够，人民政府的政策未为群众所了解，致群众为某些村干部所蒙蔽和胁迫。再者是领导上对过去类似的问题处理不严，放纵了个别村干部的错误。就如八区大新庄支部书记非法派粮已不止一次，且在区里发觉后追问时，他反而说：“叫反省、就反省，叫悔过、就悔过，撤职也行，就是粮食已经花完了。”此外，有些村组织不纯也是原因之一。如五区邢店带头凑粮的民兵队长就是个伪甲长“还乡团”。
    该县县政府针对上述情况，决定在全县群众中进行政策的宣传教育，使群众明了政府政策后，对某些村干部的非法摊派即可起监督作用。另外，对干部加强思想领导和政策教育，在每段工作中，明确指出：做什么，反对什么，作为干部的工作纪律。再就是对已犯错误的干部，本教育为主的方针，分别处理。对一贯表现较好，因教育不够而犯错误的干部，着重教育，除追回摊派的东西发还群众外，并在群众会上进行检讨，检讨反省比较深刻的，一般不再作法律处分。对本质不好而又屡教不改的，除追回摊派东西发还群众外，并送法院依法处分。如邢店民兵队长即除追回非法摊派的东西，行政上撤职外，并已交法院罚劳役。在作任何处分时，均注意到在群众与干部中的影响，借以达到教育群众和干部的目的。对群众的落后迷信采用说服教育方式，并严禁任何人今后借敬神等任何方式进行摊派。
