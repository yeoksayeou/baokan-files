　　State-Owned Factories and Mines in Major North China Cities
    Successfully Complete Second Quarter Production Tasks

    [Reported by this newspaper] State-owned and public factories and mines in major cities in North China, including Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong, have mostly completed or exceeded their second quarter production plans. Among them, the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau completed its first-half electricity sales task one month ahead of schedule; the Tangshan Steel Plant invented the "double-furnace steelmaking method," which can increase the monthly production of steel ingots by 2,000 to 2,600 tons. Twenty-one public factories and mines in Taiyuan City completed their second quarter production plans, with eighteen of the twenty-four major products exceeding their targets, such as iron, which reached 125.5 percent, rolled steel at 110.6 percent, and refractory materials at 125.96 percent. The coke, ammonia liquor, foul oil, and crude benzene produced by the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant generally exceeded the targets by a large margin.

    The second quarter production achievements in various regions were obtained in the midst of a vigorous production competition. The establishment of advanced production systems in various regions—such as the production record system, product inspection system, and safety responsibility system—has guaranteed and consolidated these achievements. Many factories have adopted advanced Soviet experiences and signed collective and liaison contracts. The cost of production has begun to decrease in some factories. A large number of model workers and advanced producers have also emerged. Taking the Tangshan Electric Power Bureau's power plant as an example, during the "Red May" production and conservation competition, the plant established a production responsibility system, an operation and maintenance responsibility system, and signed a collective contract, which not only completed the tasks of power generation and electricity sales, created a new record for coal consumption, but also reduced the unit cost in the second quarter by 10 percent compared to the first quarter. In the production competitions to welcome "May Day" and "July 1st," state-owned and public factories in Tianjin established product inspection systems, safety responsibility systems, etc., ensuring the completion of production tasks in April, May, and June. The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant began to establish a factory management committee and improve the workers' representative meeting in the second quarter, which played a guaranteeing role in completing the tasks.

    The main shortcomings in the second quarter production were insufficient democratic management. The management committees of general factories have not yet been able to play their due role. For example, the factory management committee of the Tianjin China Vegetable Oil Plant did not hold a single meeting in a month during the second quarter. Most leading personnel still lack planned leadership and promotion of rationalization proposals. The preliminary research or experiments of some workers or technicians with creativity are sometimes terminated due to the neglect or lack of technical assistance from leading cadres, causing losses to the work. On the other hand, planning is not precise enough, and management is not scientific enough. For example, the mining of Shanxi mining still has the phenomenon of indiscriminate mining and excavation. Among the 550 waterwheels produced by the Taiyuan Zhenxing Machinery Factory in the second quarter, 400 were substandard, and therefore, the phenomenon of waste in production is still widespread.

    In order to overcome the above shortcomings and successfully complete the third quarter production plan, the industrial leading organs in various regions have decided to universally launch production competitions or new record movements in the third quarter, while simultaneously conducting rectification, focusing on examining the leading ideology and work style, opposing bureaucracy, and strengthening democratic management; through production competitions, conducting preliminary quota work, gradually implementing quota management, and implementing the economic accounting system to achieve the goal of enterprise management. Various regions have also begun to pay attention to the improvement and implementation of the responsibility system in order to reduce and prevent accidents. A reward system that combines spiritual and material incentives will be piloted to encourage workers' enthusiasm for labor. Strengthen the unity of workers and technicians to improve production technology and increase labor efficiency.

    State-owned and public factories and mines in various regions are working with full enthusiasm to complete the third quarter production plan under the principle of benefiting both public and private interests.

　　华北主要城市国营厂矿
    胜利完成第二季生产任务
    【本报讯】华北天津、唐山、石家庄、太原、张家口、宣化、大同等主要城市国、公营厂矿第二季度生产计划多已胜利完成或超过。其中唐山电业局提前一个月完成上半年售电任务；唐山制钢厂发明了“双联炼钢法”，每月可增产钢锭二千至二千六百吨。太原市二十一个公营厂矿完成了第二季生产计划，其二十四种主要产品中有十八种产品超额完成任务，如铁完成百分之一二五点五，轧钢完成百分之一一○点六，耐火材料完成百分之一二五点九六。石家庄炼焦厂所产焦炭、铔水、臭油、粗苯普遍超过任务很多。
    各地第二季度的生产成绩是在如火如荼的生产竞赛中获得的。各地建立了先进的生产制度——如生产纪录制、产品检验制、安全负责制等又保证和巩固了这些成绩。许多工厂接受了苏联先进经验，签订了集体合同和联系合同。若干工厂成本开始下降。大批的劳动模范和先进生产者也涌现出来。以唐山电业局发电厂为例，在红五月生产节约竞赛中，该厂建立了生产负责制，运行及维护负责制，签订了集体合同，不仅完成了发电和售电的任务，创造了煤耗新纪录，而且使第二季单位成本较第一季降低百分之十。天津各国、公营工厂在迎接“五一”及“七一”的生产竞赛中，建立了产品检验制度，安全负责制等，保证了四、五、六月生产任务的完成。太原钢铁厂在第二季度中着手建立工厂管理委员会，健全工人代表会，对完成任务起了保证作用。
    第二季度生产中主要缺点是民主管理不够。一般工厂的管理委员会还不能发挥应有的作用，如天津中国植物油厂工厂管理委员会在第二季度中一个月也没有开一次会。大部分领导人员对合理化建议仍缺乏有计划的领导与推动。某些工友或技术人员具有创造性的初步研究或试验，有时因领导干部的忽视或缺乏技术帮助而中止，使工作受到损失。另一方面是计划不够精确，管理不够科学，如山西矿业的开采至今存在着乱采乱掘的现象。太原振兴机器厂在第二季所出五百五十部水车中，有四百部不合规格，因而生产中的浪费现象还普遍存在。
    各地工业领导机关为克服以上缺点，很好地完成第三季度生产计划，已决定在第三季普遍展开生产竞赛或新纪录运动，同时结合着进行整风，将着重检查领导思想作风，反对官僚主义，加强民主管理；通过生产竞赛，进行初步定额工作，逐步实行定额管理，贯彻经济核算制度，以达经营企业化的目的。各地并开始注意责任制度的健全和贯彻，以期减少和防止事故。试行精神和物质相结合的奖励制度，以鼓舞工人的劳动热情。加强工人和技术人员的团结，以改进生产技术来提高劳动效率。
    各地国、公营厂矿正以饱满热情从事劳动，在公私兼顾原则下，努力为完成第三季度生产计划而奋斗。
