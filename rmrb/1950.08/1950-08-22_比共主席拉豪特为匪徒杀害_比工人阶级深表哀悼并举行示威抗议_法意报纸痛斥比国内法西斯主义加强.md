　　Xinhua News Agency, The Hague, August 21st: According to TASS, The Hague, August 19th: The Chairman of the Belgian Communist Party, Lahaut, was murdered on the evening of the 18th near Liège by two fascist bandits.

　　Reports from Brussels and Liège say that the regions concentrated with the Belgian working class are immersed in deep grief. The newspaper Telegraaf reported that the Belgian working people are extremely angry and indignant at the barbaric assassination of Lahaut. In the industrial center of Liège, a large-scale strike has been called to protest this despicable assassination. The working people in Liège and many other cities in Belgium are marching in the streets, demanding an end to fascist reaction and severe punishment for all criminals who vilely assassinated Lahaut.

　　Xinhua News Agency, August 21st: According to a compilation of TASS news, the French Communist Party newspaper L'Humanité, in its August 20th commentary on the assassination of the Chairman of the Belgian Communist Party, Lahaut, believes that the murderer was a supporter of the King of Belgium. It also believes that Lahaut's assassination proves that fascism in Belgium has been strengthened.

　　The Italian Communist Party newspaper L'Unità on the 19th angrily denounced the assassination of Lahaut, stating: "The murderers who assassinated Lahaut actually used the despicable means of thugs and fascist bandits. The responsibility for the assassination of Lahaut should be borne by the scoundrels who incite the heinous violence against the people and the leaders of the workers' parties. The blood debt of the assassination of Lahaut should be repaid by the regimes that rule Western Europe."

　　The Italian Socialist Party newspaper Avanti! declared: "The Italian socialists are greatly angered by this incident and declare that the Italian socialists stand with their communist comrades and all the working people of Belgium who are directly harmed by this crime committed by the dying reactionaries."

　　比共主席拉豪特为匪徒杀害
    比工人阶级深表哀悼并举行示威抗议
    法意报纸痛斥比国内法西斯主义加强
    【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社海牙十九日讯：比利时共产党主席拉豪特于十八日晚间在列日附近地方被两名法西斯匪徒杀害。
    来自布鲁塞尔和列日的报道说：比利时工人阶级集中的区域正浸沉在深深的哀悼中。电讯报报道：比利时劳动人民对拉豪特惨遭野蛮的暗杀极表愤怒和愤慨。在工业中心列日城，已号召举行大规模罢工，以抗议这种卑鄙的暗杀。列日以及比利时的许多其他城市里的劳动人民在街道上游行，要求制止法西斯的反动行为，并严惩卑劣地暗杀拉豪特的一切罪犯。
    【新华社二十一日讯】综合塔斯社消息：法国共产党机关报人道报于二十日评论比利时共产党主席拉豪特遇刺一事时认为，凶手是比王的拥护者。并认为拉豪特的遇刺，证明比利时的法西斯主义已经加强。
    意大利共产党机关报团结报十九日怒斥暗杀拉豪特的行为称：刺杀拉豪特的凶手，竟然使用了暴徒和法西斯匪徒的卑鄙手段。刺杀拉豪特的责任，应由煽动对人民和工人政党领袖之穷凶极恶的暴行的恶棍们担负。刺杀拉豪特的血债，应由统治西欧的各政权偿付。
    意大利社会党机关报前进报宣称：意大利社会党人已因这次事件而大为忿怒，并宣称意大利社会党人与共产党人同志及直接受垂死挣扎的反动派所犯这种罪恶之害的比利时一切劳动人民站在一起。
