　　Propaganda and Mobilization Work in the Rural Production Movement
    Propaganda Department of the CPC Anyang Prefectural Committee, Pingyuan Province

　　In the first half of 1950, we initially explored some experiences in propaganda and mobilization work in the rural production movement.

　　The first obstacle encountered in this spring's production was the agricultural socialist ideology among the masses and党员 cadres. Although preliminary production policy education was conducted during the training of Party members last winter and this spring, and production policies were also publicized among the masses, the problem was not completely resolved. Especially among the masses, some people still doubted the policy of developing agricultural production. For example, when the secretary of the Xiabao Village branch developed from five sheep to fifteen sheep, some people exclaimed in surprise: "Our village has a new rich peasant!" Some people lent out money but were afraid to let others know. The saying "Eat well, dress well, save trouble" continued to be popular among the masses. At the Second Party Congress this spring, the line between agricultural socialism and scientific socialism and new democratic society was first clearly drawn among the leading cadres in various places, so that everyone clarified the economic policies of the New Democracy from the ideological and policy levels. After the meeting, each county convened people's representatives meetings and cadres meetings, and some places also conducted cyclical training for Party members to implement the spirit of the Party Congress, focusing on publicizing policies such as rewarding production models, protecting private property, allowing hiring of labor, and free lending. At these meetings, according to the ideological characteristics of the peasants, the propaganda method of "living typical examples" (called "meat announcements" by the cadres) was adopted, so that the masses could understand the various policies of the Party and the People's Government from their own personal experience, which was very effective. For example, the Anyang People's Representatives' Conference organized a production exhibition hall, which publicized the policy of developing production by commending the examples of Party members Li Erzhu and Niu Qingping for their efforts in developing production. It also severely punished acts that violated private property rights and publicized these facts. Zheng Peiji, a landlord in Wangzuo Village, Anyang District, intimidated the masses and seized land rights, and was punished by law. It was also used as a typical case for publicity at various temple fairs. Other counties also dealt with and publicized elements that violated property rights in a timely manner. Since then, the masses have truly believed in the government's policy of protecting property rights, and said, "It's good to have the 'law'." These vivid examples gradually made the masses realize the policies of the Party and the People's Government to develop production. The masses began to buy livestock, purchase agricultural tools, and freely lend money.

　　As the enthusiasm for production rose, the masses put forward new requirements: "It is good to be rich, but there are not many ways." At this time, the leadership realized that the masses demanded to be organized and to improve farming techniques, so they publicized the methods of organizing, developing production, and moving towards prosperity. And explained in detail the policies of mutual assistance, voluntary mutual benefit, and improved technology. At the same time, some new methods were created in propaganda work: The first is to organize the masses to participate in propaganda work. At this time, the propagandists were not limited to a few staff members who specialized in propaganda work. Experienced and skilled old farmers, reformers and creators in production, and labor heroes have become vivid propagandists. There has also been progress in the form of propaganda, from using people as living typical examples to using small farms, exhibition halls, comic strips, field experiments, and field visits to conduct extensive publicity. The best occasions for concentrating these activities are the internal and external activities of the People's Representatives' Conference, especially the external activities and temple fairs. When convening people's representatives conferences, all counties paid attention to organizing external activities, such as arranging exhibition halls about improved technology comic strips and excellent varieties, seed soaking experiments, insecticides and tools, and new agricultural tools. Or organize representatives to visit the fields, compare crops, and invite labor models and experienced old farmers to explain. Publicity at temple fairs is also one of the most popular methods among the masses. At the Beiguan Temple Fair in Lin County, there were publicity sheds, exhibition halls, and costumed propaganda teams. The propaganda team took cotton and explained to everyone how to manage cotton; they took crop pests (fire spiders, oil drought) and publicized methods of pest control. Some temple fairs also organized speeches by labor models. This form of publicity has now been extended to the village. For example, in each food market in Yaocun, Lin County, various publicity samples are exhibited and technical publicity is carried out according to agricultural needs. In addition, in each agricultural activity, vivid and lively propaganda and mobilization slogans suitable for agricultural activities were put forward to guide and organize mass actions. For example, when watering wheat, it was proposed: "People, wells, and pulleys are never idle"; in pest control and drought resistance, it was proposed: "Protecting seedlings is like protecting life, and eliminating insects is like putting out fires"; "Watering one plant is one plant, and planting one point is one point." When the masses are working, various slogans are used to encourage and give play to the labor enthusiasm of the masses, such as "What is said is done, and no empty cannons are fired." "Men, women, old and young, work hard, and the planned goals must be achieved. The wheat must be harvested in a few days, and men and women strive to be models." Such propaganda and mobilization have played a great role in promoting production activities at each stage.

　　In the actual work in the past six months, we have realized that to do a good job in propaganda and mobilization in rural areas, we must first grasp the ideological characteristics of the peasants and create various ways for the masses to correctly understand the various policies of the Party and the People's Government and various agricultural technologies to improve agricultural production from their own personal experience. Under the limitations of individual economic conditions, and poisoned by feudal ideas for a long time, peasants are generally conservative and stubborn in their thinking and are not easy to accept new things. They often hold a skeptical attitude towards things they have not personally experienced. When the government advocates seed soaking, they are afraid of scalding it to death, afraid that it will not come out after soaking, and afraid that it will not be cold-resistant and will not grow well. We talked about a lot of benefits, but they still didn't believe it. In this case, the propaganda method of "living typical examples" is very necessary. Labor heroes, creators in production, and experienced old farmers, when they use their own personal experience, especially when they use real objects to publicize to the masses, it is easier to gain the trust of the masses than the speeches of people who are specifically responsible for propaganda work. At the same time, organizing the power of the masses in the propaganda work to expand the power of propaganda work and make the scope of propaganda more extensive. This is also one of the important tasks of propagandists.

　　Secondly, we have realized that, to make the propaganda and mobilization work in rural areas in-depth and regular, the important issue is: the organizational form of establishing village-level propaganda institutions. In our region, there are roughly three types: clubs, propaganda joint meetings, and propagandists. With these organizations in the village, various propaganda tools can be used in a unified way, such as mass blackboards, radio stations, food markets, etc., and it is also convenient to organize various forces (primary school teachers, intellectuals in the township, businessmen, and labor heroes, etc.). However, to enable village-level propaganda agencies to better exert their strength, there must be good leadership, which requires strengthening the leadership of the branch over propaganda and mobilization work. In addition to dispatching the best Party members to participate in propaganda and mobilization work, the branch should also regularly organize and check these work.

### 农村生产运动中的宣传鼓动工作

　　农村生产运动中的宣传鼓动工作
    中共平原省安阳地委宣传部
    在一九五零年上半年的工作中，我们初步摸索到一些农村生产运动中的宣传鼓动工作经验。
    今春生产中首先碰到的障碍是群众中、以及党员干部中的农业社会主义思想。虽然去冬今春集训党员时曾初步进行了生产政策教育并在群众中也宣传了生产政策，但问题并没有彻底解决。特别是在群众中，仍有人对发展农业生产的政策怀疑。例如：当下堡村支部书记从五只羊发展到十五只羊时，就有人惊奇地说：“咱村有了新富农了！”有些人放了账不敢让人知道。“好吃好穿，省得麻烦”的说法，还继续在群众中流行着。今春二次党代会上，首先在各地领导骨干中明确划清农业社会主义与科学社会主义及新民主主义社会等界限，使大家从思想上，政策上明确了新民主主义的经济政策。会后，各县就召开人民代表会、干部会，有的地方还轮回训练党员，贯彻党代会的精神，集中宣传奖励生产模范、保障私有财产、允许雇工和自由借贷等政策。在这些会议上，根据农民的思想特点，采用了“活典型”（干部称之为“肉布告”）的宣传方法，使群众从自己的亲身经验中来认识党和人民政府的各种政策，收效很大。如安阳各界代表会，组织了生产展览馆，通过表扬党员李二柱、牛庆屏努力发展生产的事例，宣传了发展生产的政策。又对侵犯私人财权的行为作了严厉的制裁，并将这些事实加以宣传。安阳一区王佐村地主郑配基，吓唬群众、侵夺地权，就受到了法律制裁。并被作为典型在各处庙会上进行宣传。其他各县也及时处理了侵犯财权的分子和进行了宣传。从此群众真正相信了政府保障财权的政策，都说“有‘王法’就好了”。这些活生生的例子逐渐使群众认识了党和人民政府的发展生产的政策。群众中买牲口、置农具、自由借贷的事情开始出现了。
    群众随着生产情绪的高涨，就提出了新的要求：“富裕虽然好，就是办法还不多。”这时领导上体会到群众要求组织起来与改进耕作技术了，就宣传组织起来，发展生产，走向富裕的办法。并详细解释了互助的自愿两利及改进技术等政策。同时在宣传工作上创造了一些新方法：首先是组织群众力量参加宣传工作。这时的宣传员就不只限于几个专门做宣传工作的工作人员。有经验有技术的老农，生产中的改革者创造者，以及劳动英雄等都成了生动活泼的宣传员。在宣传形式上也有了进步，由用人做活典型，发展到用小农场、展览馆、连环画、实地试验、地里参观等方式，广泛地进行宣传。集中这些活动的最好场合是人民代表会议的会内外活动，特别是会外活动和庙会。各县在召开人民代表会议时，都注意组织了会外活动，比如布置有关于改良技术的连环画及优良品种、浸种试验、杀虫药品工具及新式农具等的展览馆。或者是组织代表到地里参观，评比庄稼，并请劳动模范和有经验的老农进行解释。在庙会上宣传也是一种最受群众欢迎的方法。林县北关庙会上有宣传棚、展览馆和宣传队的化装宣传。宣传队拿着棉花，向大家解释怎样管理棉花；拿着吃庄稼的害虫（火蜘蛛、油旱）宣传治虫的办法。有些庙会还组织了劳动模范讲演。现在这种宣传方式已经发展到村。例如林县姚村的各个饭市上，都根据农事需要，展览各种宣传样本，和进行技术宣传。此外，在每个农事活动中，并提出了适合农事活动的生动活泼的宣传鼓动口号，指导与组织群众行动。如浇麦时提出：“人、井、辘辘三不闲”；治虫抗旱中提出：“保苗如保命，灭虫如灭火”；“浇活一棵是一棵，种上一分是一分”。在群众劳动时，又以各种口号鼓动发挥群众的劳动热情，如“说到做到，不放空炮。”“男女老少加油干，订的计划要实现，麦子几天要割完，男女争取当模范。”这样的宣传鼓动对每个阶段的生产活动都起了很大的推动作用。
    在半年来的实际工作中，使我们体会到要做好农村中的宣传鼓动工作，首先必须抓住农民的思想特点，创造各种使群众从自己亲身经验中正确认识党和人民政府各种政策及改进农业生产的各种农业技术。农民在个体经济条件限制下，又长期受封建思想的毒害，一般是思想保守固执，不易接受新鲜事物。常常是对没有亲身体验过的事物，抱着怀疑的态度。政府提倡浸种，他们就怕烫死，怕浸了出不来，怕不耐寒长不好等。我们讲了一大套好处，他们还是一个不相信。在这种情况下，“活典型”的宣传方法就十分必要。劳动英雄、生产中的创造者和有经验的老农，他们以自己亲身的经验，特别是用实物向群众进行宣传时，就比专门负责宣传工作的人员的讲话容易取得群众的信任。同时也把群众力量组织在宣传工作内，使宣传工作力量扩大，使宣传的范围更广泛。这也是宣传鼓动工作者重要任务之一。
    其次，我们体会到，要使农村中的宣传鼓动工作深入、经常，重要的问题是：建设村级宣传机构的组织形式。在我区大体有这三种：俱乐部、宣联会、宣传员。村中有了这些组织，就可统一运用各种宣传工具，如大众黑板、广播台、饭市等，同时也便于组织各种力量（小学教员，在乡知识分子，商人及劳动英雄等）。但要使村级宣传机构更好地发挥力量，必须有很好的领导，这就要加强支部对宣传鼓动工作的领导。支部除了应当派遣最好的党员参加宣传鼓动工作外，并要经常组织与检查这些工作。
