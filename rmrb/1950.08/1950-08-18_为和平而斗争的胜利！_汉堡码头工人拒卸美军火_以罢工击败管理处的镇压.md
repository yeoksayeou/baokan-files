Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: A compilation of TASS reports: The dockworkers of the port of Hamburg in West Germany have achieved a victory in their recent struggle to refuse to unload munitions for the American and British imperialists.

On August 8th, the Hamburg port management unreasonably fired forty-one workers because they refused to unload munitions from three British ships. The next day, the workers held a mass meeting and announced a strike in protest.

The strike received full support from the citizens of Hamburg, and employees in many enterprises donated large amounts of aid funds to the Hamburg Peace Committee. The women of Hamburg said to the dockworkers: "Don't unload weapons, they are aimed at you!" Under these circumstances, the Hamburg port management had no choice but to retract its decision to fire the workers on the 12th, and the workers have therefore decided to resume work.

In a statement on the matter, the Hamburg Peace Committee pointed out: "The strike of the Hamburg dockworkers demonstrates that the workers' struggle for peace is extremely resolute."

    汉堡码头工人拒卸美军火  以罢工击败管理处的镇压
    【新华社十七日讯】综合塔斯社消息：西德汉堡港的码头工人，在最近一次为拒绝替美英帝国主义者起卸军火而进行的斗争中，取得了胜利。
    本月八日，该港码头管理处以工人拒绝起卸三艘英国船只上的军火，曾无理开除了四十一名工人。第二天，工人们即举行了群众大会并宣布罢工，以示抗议。
    罢工获得了汉堡市民的充分支持，许多企业中的员工向汉堡和平委员会捐助了大批援助基金。汉堡的妇女们对码头工人说：“不要起卸武器，它们正是向你们瞄准的。”在这种情形下，汉堡码头管理处不得不于十二日收回了开除工人的决定，工人们因此已决定复工。
    汉堡和平委员会在就此事发表的声明中指出：“汉堡码头工人的罢工，表明了工人们为拥护和平而斗争是异常坚决的。”
