　　Xinhua News Agency, August 24th dispatch: Comprehensive report from the Romanian News Agency: On August 23rd, the people of Romania warmly celebrated the sixth anniversary of liberation.

　　Grand celebrations were held throughout Romania. In Bucharest, the capital of Romania, the streets were decorated with red flags, flowers, and huge portraits of Stalin and Romanian people's leaders. Groups of people dancing Romanian folk dances passed by from time to time. Slogans and cartoons were hung everywhere, condemning the imperialist warmongers and their Titoist running dogs with striking words and images, and powerfully expressing the firm will of the Romanian working people to defend peace. In Victory Square, in front of the Soviet Hero Monument, wreaths presented by the Romanian people were piled high.

　　On the morning of the 23rd, a grand military parade and a demonstration of hundreds of thousands of people were held in Stalin Square in Bucharest. Amidst the crowd's stormy cheers, Parhon, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian National Assembly, Groza, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, General Secretary of the Workers' Party, and government and Workers' Party leaders entered the venue.

　　Seated in the VIP seats were: the Soviet government delegation headed by Soviet Marshal Sokolovsky, government delegations from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Hungary, as well as diplomatic envoys and embassy staff from various countries.

　　Amidst the grand music of a large orchestra composed of six hundred people, General Bodnăraş, Minister of the Armed Forces of Romania, announced the start of the parade and read out the festival order. The cheers of "Long live Stalin, the great liberator of Romania" rose and lingered. Amidst the majestic military music, the review began. Officers from the military academy, sixteen in a row, walked in the front, their chests flashing with medals won while fighting side by side with the Soviet army against the Nazi aggressors, followed by infantry, navy, border guards, cavalry, and troops of various arms. Immediately following were the worker defense corps that defended the capital six years ago.

　　Amid cheers, the ranks of hundreds of thousands of metallurgical workers, railway workers, and textile workers entered the square. They held high the national emblem of the Romanian People's Republic, portraits of the great Stalin and Romanian government and Workers' Party leaders, portraits of labor heroes, and charts showing achievements in exceeding production plans, etc. Thousands of banners were inscribed with slogans paying tribute to the great Soviet Union and Stalin, to the great Chinese people and the heroic Korean fighters, and to the fraternal people's democratic countries. As the procession marched, colored balloons floated in the sky, and waves of flags fluttered in the ranks. Overlooking from the stands, the square was like a brilliant ocean in the sunlight.

　　After the meeting, tens of thousands of citizens gathered everywhere to watch various performances, and cheers and applause rose and fell. At night, brilliant lights added to the festive grandeur of Bucharest. The reveling people sang and danced wildly until late at night.

    【新华社二十四日讯】综合罗马尼亚通讯社消息：八月二十三日，罗马尼亚全国人民热烈庆祝了解放六周年纪念日。
    罗马尼亚各地都举行了盛大庆祝会。在罗京布加勒斯特，街道上到处装饰着红旗、鲜花、巨幅的斯大林像和罗马尼亚人民领袖的画像。不时有跳着罗马尼亚民族舞的人群结队通过。到处悬挂着的标语和漫画，以醒目的语句和画面斥责帝国主义战争贩子及其铁托走狗，并且有力地说出了罗马尼亚劳动人民保卫和平的坚强意志。在胜利广场上的苏联英雄纪念碑前面，堆满了罗马尼亚人民献送的花圈。
    二十三日上午，在布加勒斯特的斯大林广场上举行了盛大的武装部队检阅和数十万人参加的示威游行。在会众暴风雨般的欢呼声中，罗马尼亚国民议会主席团主席巴洪、部长会议主席格罗查、工人党总书记乔治乌——德治和政府及工人党领袖步入会场。
    在贵宾席上坐着的有：以苏联元帅索科洛夫斯基为首的苏联政府代表团、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和匈牙利的政府代表团，以及各国的外交使节及使馆人员。
    在六百人组成的大乐队的宏大乐声中，罗马尼亚武装部队部部长波德纳拉西上将宣布阅兵典礼开始，并宣读了节日命令。历久不息的欢呼声“罗马尼亚的伟大解放者斯大林万岁”的声音随之而起。在雄壮的军乐声中，检阅开始。十六人一列的军官学校的军官们走在最前面，他们的胸口闪烁着与苏军并肩对纳粹侵略者作战时所获得的勋章，其后是步兵、海军、边防军、骑兵和各兵种的队伍。紧接着的是六年前保卫首都的工人保卫团。
    在一片欢呼声中，数十万冶金工人、铁路工人和纺织工人的队伍进入广场。他们高举着罗马尼亚人民共和国国徽，伟大的斯大林及罗马尼亚政府和工人党领袖的画像，劳动英雄的画像，表明超计划生产成就的图表等等。成千上万的标语牌，写着向伟大的苏联和斯大林，向伟大的中国人民和英勇的朝鲜战士，向各兄弟人民民主国家致敬的口号。行列行进时，上空飘荡着彩色的汽球，队伍里飘荡着旗帜的波涛，从看台上俯瞰下去，广场上一如阳光下的璀璨的海洋。
    大会结束后，数以万计的市民到处围观着各种表演，欢呼声与喝采声此起彼落。入夜，辉煌的灯火为布加勒斯特增加了节日的壮观。狂欢的人民狂欢歌舞直到深夜。
