　　Under the Guidance and Assistance of the People's Bank of Beijing
　　Business of Private Banks and Money Shops Improved
　　Losses Basically Stopped, and Deposits and Loans Gradually Increased.
　　[Report from this newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: Under the guidance and assistance of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank, private banks and money shops in Beijing have improved their operations, overcome difficulties, and their business has gradually improved. After the stabilization of financial prices in Beijing, as of the end of May, as many as 26 private banks and money shops had closed down due to bad debts and losses, accounting for about half of all private banks and money shops. At that time, in order to assist private banks and money shops to improve their operations and closely integrate with production, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank promptly provided a series of guidance. First, it promoted the banks and money shops to reduce interest rates five times successively from March 28, from the original high lending rate of 69% to the current 5.1%. Second, in May, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank personally participated in leading the organization of a joint loan syndicate to focus on using funds to support production. However, because private banks and money shops initially lacked sufficient understanding of the new economic situation, the joint syndicate's loans failed to develop actively, and the amount of loans granted was not large; it was not until mid-July that the loan conditions were relaxed and the total loan amount was increased from 3 billion yuan to 6 billion yuan. In assisting to overcome difficulties in capital turnover and developing business, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank provided great convenience to the banks and money shops, the important ones including: (1) When prices had just stabilized and some private banks and money shops were short of funds, they were specially allowed to use part of their reserve funds. In April and May, 14 banks and money shops used them 33 times, solving the difficulty of temporary capital turnover; (2) The deposit reserve funds of private banks and money shops deposited with the state banks were originally calculated interest based on current deposits, but now they are calculated based on one-month fixed deposits, with interest increased by nearly one time; (3) When private banks and money shops transfer funds to various interbank branches through the People's Bank, the exchange rate is given an 80% discount; (4) Checks from various banks and money shops can be used to pay taxes, and the circulation period of checks is extended to one month; (5) Banks and money shops are encouraged to offer fixed-term and current deposits and principal-protected deposits to enable them to absorb idle social funds and expand their business in various ways. Most banks and money shops have now opened fixed-term and current deposits and are preparing to open principal-protected deposits.
　　Since June, the phenomenon of losses in private banks and money shops has basically stopped. Deposits and loans have gradually increased. The average deposit balance in June increased by 12% compared to May, and the average loan balance increased by 18.24% compared to May. Deposits and loans increased even more in July. As of July 31, the total deposit balance was 52.2 billion yuan, an increase of 22.8% compared to June 30; the total loan balance was 24.6 billion yuan, an increase of 47% compared to June 30. At the same time, the proportion of loans to deposits has also increased. For example, in May it was 39.7%, in June it increased to 41.87%, and by July 31 it increased to 45.9%.
　　At present, all private banks and money shops have improved their operational enthusiasm and realized that only by resolutely taking the road of serving production can their business develop normally. Most banks and money shops are further improving their management in accordance with this policy, trying to formulate financial plans, and strengthening planning from absorbing deposits and using funds to balancing expenditures. Some banks and money shops, such as Jincheng and Dalu, have also established labor-capital consultation meetings to discuss how labor and capital can work together to improve business.

　　京人民银行指导和帮助下
    私营银钱业业务好转
    亏损现象基本停止，存放款逐步上升。
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：京市私营银行钱庄在人民银行北京分行指导与协助下，改善经营，克服困难，业务已逐渐好转。京市私营行庄在金融物价稳定后，一度因呆账和亏损而倒闭的，到五月底止，达二十六家之多，约占全部私营行庄的半数。当时，人民银行北京分行为了协助私营行庄改善经营，使与生产事业密切结合，即及时地给予了一系列的指导。首先是推动各行庄从三月二十八日起先后五次降低利率，由原来放款高利六十九分降到目前五分一厘。其次是人民银行北京分行于五月间亲自参加领导组织联合贷款银团，以集中使用资金扶植生产。但因私营行庄最初对经济新形势认识不足，所以联合银团放款未能积极开展，贷出数额不多；到七月中旬才放宽贷款条件，同时将贷款总额由三十亿元扩增为六十亿元。在协助克服资金周转困难和开展业务方面，人民银行北京分行给各行庄极大便利，重要者计有：（一）当物价刚一稳定，有些私营行庄头寸短绌时，曾特别准许动用一部分准备金，计四、五月间先后有十四家行庄动用三十三次，解决了临时资金周转不灵的困难；（二）私营行庄交国行的存款准备金，原按活期存款计息，现改按定期一月存款计息，利息提高将近一倍；（三）各私营行庄通过人民银行向各地联行调拨款项时，汇率给予八折优待；（四）各行庄支票可以抵交税款，并延长支票流通期限至一个月；（五）鼓励各行庄举办定活两便和保本保值存款，使各行庄以多种多样方式吸收社会闲散资金，扩大业务，现大部行庄已开办定活两便存款，正准备开办保本保值存款。
    自入六月后，私营行庄亏损现象就基本停止。存放款都已逐步上升。六月份存款平均余额比五月份增加百分之十二，放款平均余额比五月份增加百分之十八点二四。七月份存放款增加更多，到七月三十一日，存款总余额是五二二亿元，比六月三十日增加百分之二十二点八；放款总余额是二四六亿元，比六月三十一日增加百分之四十七。同时放款占存款的比例额也已增加，如五月份是百分之三十九点七，六月份就增到百分之四十一点八七，到七月三十一日就增到百分之四十五点九。
    目前各私营行庄都已提高了经营积极性，认识到只有坚决走向为生产事业服务的道路，业务才能正常发展。大部行庄正本着这个方针进一步改善经营管理，试订财务计划，从吸收存款、运用资金到平衡开支，都加强了计划性。有些行庄如金城、大陆等并已成立了劳资协商会议，讨论劳资怎样共同协力搞好业务。
