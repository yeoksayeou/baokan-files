Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 3rd: A unit of the People's Liberation Army First Field Army held a grand military parade in Dihua City on the 23rd anniversary of the "August 1st" Army Day.

　　On this day, as the sun crossed the snow-capped mountains of the Tianshan Mountains and shone on Dihua City, an important town on the frontier of the motherland, neat formations of the People's Liberation Army and people from all ethnic groups entered the parade ground outside the North Gate one after another. As the military parade began, the solemn national flag slowly rose into the sky in the morning glow. After Commander Luo Yuanfa, the general commander of the military parade, reported the unit designations and numbers of troops participating in the military parade to General Wang Zhen, he immediately issued the parade order. Red signal flares streaked across the sky, and the salute guns fired twenty-three times. General Wang Zhen, Acting Commander of the Xinjiang Military Region, General Tao Zhiyue, Deputy Commander, and General Xu Liqing, Director of the Political Department, began to review the People's Liberation Army infantry, cavalry, artillery, tank units, armored units, and motorized units. As the march-past began, led by the band and the People's Liberation Army military flag, the infantry units of the People's Liberation Army first passed the reviewing stand. This invincible infantry force marched from Yan'an, the sacred site of the revolution, all the way to the western border of the motherland in the war to liberate Northwest China, and today they are carrying out the great task of completely eliminating the US imperialist armed spy Usman bandit and developing the border and defending the border. The cavalry units of the Fifth Army of the People's Liberation Army, which had fought bloody battles with the Kuomintang bandit army for five years and liberated the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan, gloriously participated in the grand review of the People's Liberation Army's birthday celebration for the first time. The well-trained warhorses, with strong strides, neatly walked past the reviewing stand. Following the Fifth Army cavalry troops that were reviewed were the People's Artillery troops. This artillery force had repeatedly defeated the Kuomintang bandit artillery trained by American officers in the mountains of northern Shaanxi, on the Jingwei Plain, and in the ancient city of Lanzhou, and continuously seized various types of American-made cannons from the hands of the Kuomintang bandit army to arm and strengthen itself. Behind the artillery units was a long line of People's tank units, armored units, and motorized units. When the ground units of various branches of the People's Liberation Army had finished passing by, the People's Air Force flew in formation from afar, accepting the solemn review.

　　After the Dihua City military and civilians celebrated the August 1st Army Day and the rally against the US aggression against Taiwan and Korea, all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army participating in the military parade also participated in a demonstration parade of 50,000 people. People from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Dihua City crowded the streets, cheering the People's Liberation Army and the marching columns in different languages, and throwing flowers and colored paper at the warriors of the People's Liberation Army. The loud slogans of "Oppose US aggression against Taiwan and Korea," "Support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and Tibet," "Salute General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people," and "Support the Soviet Union, the world fortress of peace" rose and fell, demonstrating the powerful strength of the people on the frontier in defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression.

    【新华社迪化三日电】人民解放军第一野战军一部，于“八一”建军节二十三周年纪念日在迪化市举行了盛大的阅兵式。
    是日，当太阳越过天山积雪的山头，普照着祖国边疆重镇迪化城头的时候，人民解放军和各族各界人民整齐的行列，就陆续地进入北门外的阅兵场。阅兵式开始，庄严的国旗在晨辉中缓缓升入天空。阅兵式总指挥罗元发军长向王震将军报告了参加阅兵式的部队番号和人数后，当即发布阅兵命令。红色信号弹划过天空，礼炮连鸣二十三响。新疆军区代司令员王震将军、副司令员陶峙岳将军、政治部主任徐立清将军开始检阅人民解放军步兵、骑兵、炮兵、战车部队、装甲部队和摩托部队。分列式开始，以音乐队和人民解放军军旗为先导，人民解放军的步兵部队首先走过阅兵台。这支无敌的步兵在解放大西北的战争里由革命圣地延安一直进军到祖国的西部边疆，今天又在执行着彻底剿灭美帝武装间谍乌斯满匪徒和开发边疆、卫戍边疆国防的巨大任务。曾与国民党匪军血战五年而解放了伊犁、塔城、阿山三区的人民解放军第五军骑兵部队，首次光荣地参加了人民解放军诞生节日的大检阅。久经训练的战马，跨着雄健的步伐，整齐地从检阅台前走过。紧跟着第五军骑兵军队受检阅的是人民的炮兵部队。这支炮兵在陕北山地，在泾渭平原，在兰州古城，曾经一次又一次地击败了由美国军官训练出来的国民党匪军炮兵，并不断地从国民党匪军手中缴获美国制造的各式大炮武装了自己，壮大了自己。在炮兵部队后面是一长列的人民战车部队、装甲部队和摩托化部队。当人民解放军各兵种地面部队通过完了时，人民空军列队自远而近掠空而过，接受庄严的检阅。
    在迪化市军民庆祝八一建军节和反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜的大会后，参加阅兵式的人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员又参加了五万人的示威大游行。迪化市各族各界的人民拥塞街头，以不同的语言向人民解放军和游行行列欢呼，并以鲜花彩纸投向人民解放军的勇士们。“反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜”，“支援人民解放军解放台湾、西藏”，“向朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军致敬”，“拥护世界和平堡垒苏联”的响亮口号声此落彼起，显现了边疆人民保卫世界和平、反对侵略战争的强大力量。
