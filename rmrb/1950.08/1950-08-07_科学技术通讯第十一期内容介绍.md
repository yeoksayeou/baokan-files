Introduction to the Contents of Science and Technology Communication, Issue 11

The 11th issue of "Science and Technology Communication," published by the Science and Technology Publishing House, was released on the 5th. Key content in this issue includes "Factory Planning Work," written in coordination with the planning meeting heavily emphasized by the Ministry of Heavy Industry and soon to be held in Beijing. This article explains in plain language how planning work should be implemented from top to bottom to every worker in the factory. "Production Experience of the Zhao Xiuying Group" illustrates that the production experience of the Ma Hengchang Group is not only applicable to machinery factories but can also be promoted to other factories. This article reports on the experience of Qingdao Textile Factory No. 4 in promoting the Ma Hengchang Group's experience. Starting from this issue, the journal has opened a column called "Technical Discussion," which publishes three articles: "Suggestions for Improving Peanut Oil Extraction," "Discussion on Several Issues in Contact Method Sulfuric Acid Plants," and "Questions Regarding the Type 51 White Coal Automobile." These all address technically important and commonly existing problems. The journal will pay special attention to this column in the future and welcomes technical workers from all over the country to participate in the discussions. Regarding articles on technical knowledge, this issue contains "Talking about Processing and Cutting in Mechanical Manufacturing," "How to Reduce Material Costs?" "Installation, Operation, and Maintenance of Centrifugal Water Pumps," "Faults and Repairs of Induction Motors," and "The Latest Proportioning Method for Concrete Raw Materials," among others, all of which are important reference materials for on-site work.

The journal was expanded and reorganized into the "Science and Technology Publishing House" on July 1st, jointly led by the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central People's Government, Sanlian Bookstore, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Currently, the focus of work is mainly to strengthen the work of the "Science and Technology Communication" magazine. The journal will soon complete its first year, and from the second year, it plans to reform the content to meet the needs of the majority of readers. It is currently seeking opinions from all sides.
