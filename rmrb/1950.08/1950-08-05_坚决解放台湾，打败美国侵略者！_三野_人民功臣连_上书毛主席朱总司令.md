　　"Resolutely Liberate Taiwan, Defeat the American Aggressors!"
    A Letter to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu from the Third Field Army's "People's Meritous Service Company"

    Dear Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu:
    We salute you on this glorious "August 1st" Army Day and report on the situation of our company.
    The predecessor of our company was a certain company of the Fujian Workers' and Peasants' Red Army Independent Division. After the Red Army's main force went north to resist Japan during the 25,000-li Long March, the Fujian Red Army carried out guerrilla warfare. Although none of the comrades from that time can be found in the company now, this glorious history has been told by veteran Red Army comrades to new comrades; those who came earlier passed it on to those who came later; now it has been passed on to our generation, and it will be passed on forever in the future. How difficult it was then! The enemy used heavy troops to "mop up," and our veteran Red Army comrades, under the leadership of the current Commander Ye Fei, persisted in fighting, eating tree bark, wild vegetables, and bamboo shoots from the mountains, and covering themselves with leaves at night. Many comrades sacrificed gloriously, such as the Communist Party member Xu Wang (then the Secretary of the Shouning County Party Committee), who was stabbed to death alive by the enemy with steel needles. By 1934, the force had dwindled from four or five thousand people to just over three hundred. But the veteran Red Army comrades at that time had one thought, which was: "With the Communist Party in place, with Chairman Mao in place, the revolution will succeed one day!" So everyone vowed: "Even if I'm the only one left, I'll carry on to the end!" The method used was what you have repeatedly taught us: "Rely on the masses, mobilize the masses." The power of the people is truly great. Relying on this power, the Red Army finally persevered. In 1935, the current Commander Su Yu led his troops to eastern Fujian to join Commander Ye Fei. The red flag of this force often fluttered in eastern Fujian, northern Fujian, and southern Zhejiang.
    Our company has always maintained the Red Army's tradition and style of heroic struggle. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, in the Battle of Huangqiao in northern Jiangsu, our company engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy and wiped them out. In the Battle of Cheqiao in northern Jiangsu, our company, in addition to annihilating a large number of enemies, also captured twelve enemy soldiers alive. In constant battles, our combat effectiveness has been increasing day by day. There is a slogan in the company: "We used to be a Red Army company, and we must add glory to glory!"
    Encouraged by this slogan, we made collective great contributions in the War of Liberation, and the higher Party committee awarded us the glorious title of "People's Meritorious Service First Company." That was in the Battle of Laiwu in Shandong in February 1947. With the support of fraternal units, our company blocked the escape route of the Kuomintang bandit army led by Li Xianzhou and his seven divisions. In Xiaowa Village, three li north of Laiwu city, we fought fiercely with the Kuomintang reactionaries with one against ten for a whole day, without retreating a single step, giving the entire army time to complete its battle deployment and creating favorable conditions for annihilating 60,000 enemies. In this battle, many of our dear and outstanding comrades sacrificed heroically, but the victory and glory we won are immortal!
    Now, we are resolutely carrying out your orders, actively preparing to liberate Taiwan, and crushing the conspiracy of the American imperialists to invade our territory. Although the weather is so hot, we are training troops intensely and enthusiastically on the coast. Our Party branch made a resolution at the beginning of the training: "Promote military democracy, create experience in cross-sea operations, and strive to be training models." All the cadres and soldiers of the company have also set personal training and merit-making plans to realize the Party's resolution. Many comrades train all day long and don't have time for their clothes to dry. During the exercise to land, break through, and clear obstacles, many comrades had their skin pierced by barbed wire, and the blood flowed down their bodies, but they didn't care. We have also been using our brains to come up with ideas and promote military democracy. Liu Shifa, the squad leader of our company's 13th squad, created a new formation. This formation has not only been adopted by the entire regiment, but also has been commended and circulated by the army, instructing the entire army to learn and adopt this formation. Many actions, essentials, and combat commands in cross-sea operations are also improving rapidly. Everyone's determination to liberate Taiwan is very strong, and they are very angry at the American imperialists' vicious armed intervention.
    Finally, we report to you: Now our company, which has been educated and cultivated by you, in addition to winning the glorious title of "People's Meritorious Service First Company," has also won the glorious titles of eight major merit squads and one honorary platoon. The company has one special-class hero, two East China People's Heroes, one combat model, three work models, and seventy-eight People's Meritorious Servicemen with fourth-class merit or above. The whole company has one hundred and two Communist Party members. We assure you: We will never be arrogant or complacent, we will definitely learn humbly, and maintain the glory and excellent qualities of our Red Army, Party members, People's Heroes, and People's Meritorious Servicemen. We will work together with fraternal units to resolutely liberate Taiwan, defeat the American aggressors, and resolutely defend our motherland and consolidate our national defense! We wish you good health!

    All commanders and fighters of the Third Field Army "People's Meritorious Service First Company"

### “坚决解放台湾，打败美国侵略者！”  三野“人民功臣连”上书毛主席朱总司令

　　“坚决解放台湾，打败美国侵略者！”
    三野“人民功臣连”上书毛主席朱总司令亲爱的毛主席、朱总司令：
    我们在这个光荣的“八一”节日向您们致敬，并报告我们这个连的情况。
    我们这个连的前身，就是福建工农红军独立师的某连。红军主力经二万五千里长征北上抗日后，福建红军就进行了游击战争。虽说那时候的同志现在连里一个也找不到了，但是这段光荣历史，由红军老同志告诉新同志；先来的传给后来的；现在传到我们这一代了，以后还要永远传下去。那时候多艰苦啊，敌人用重兵扫荡，我们红军老同志在现在的叶飞司令员领导下坚持作战，吃的是山上的树皮、野菜、竹笋，晚上盖的是树叶子。许多同志都光荣牺牲了，如共产党员许望同志（当时是寿宁县委书记）是叫敌人用钢针活活戳死的。到一九三四年，队伍从四五千人只剩下三百多人了。但是那时候的红军老同志有一个思想，就是：“有共产党在，有毛主席在，革命总有一天要成功！”所以大家发誓说：“就剩下我一个，也要干到底！”用的办法就是您所一再教导我们的：“依靠群众、发动群众”。老百姓的力量真大，红军靠着这股力量终于坚持下来。一九三五年，现在的粟裕司令员带了队伍来到闽东与叶飞司令员会合了。这支队伍的红旗经常飘扬在闽东、闽北、浙南一带。
    我们这个连始终保持着红军英勇斗争的传统与作风。在八年抗战中，苏北黄桥一战，我们这个连跟敌人展开肉搏战，消灭了敌人。苏北车桥战役中，我们这个连除了歼灭大量的敌人外，还活捉敌人十二名。在不断的战斗中，我们的战斗力日益提高了。连里有句口号：“我们过去是红军的连队，要在光荣上面加光荣！”
    在这个口号的鼓舞下，在解放战争中，我们又立了集体大功，上级党委授给了我们“人民功臣第一连”的光荣称号。那是一九四七年二月的山东莱芜战役，我们这个连在兄弟部队支援下，堵住了国民党匪军李仙洲率领的七个师的逃路。在莱芜城北三里地的小洼村，我们以一挡十地和国民党反动派匪军激战一天，一步未退，使全军争取了时间，完成战斗部署，造成了全歼六万敌人的有利条件。在这次战役中，我们连里许多亲爱的优秀同志英勇牺牲了，但换来的胜利和光荣，是永远不朽的！
    现在，我们正坚决执行您们的命令，积极准备解放台湾，粉碎美帝国主义者侵略我国领土的阴谋。虽然天气这样炎热，但我们紧张热烈地在海边练兵。我们党支部在练兵开始时就作出了“发扬军事民主，创造渡海作战经验，争取做练兵模范”的决议。全连干部、战士，为实现党的决议，也都订出了个人练兵立功计划。许多同志整天练兵就没有衣服干的时候。演习登陆突破扫除障碍时，许多同志被铁丝刺破了皮肉，血在身上直流也不管。我们大家又开动脑筋想办法，发扬军事民主。我们连的十三班长刘世法同志创造出一种新的队形。这种队形不仅已被全团采用，而且军里也通报表扬，指示全军要学习采用这个队形。许多动作、要领、渡海作战中的战斗指挥，也在很快地提高。大家对解放台湾的决心非常强，对美帝国主义者凶恶的武装干涉非常气愤。
    最后，我们报告您：现在我们这个由您教育培养出来的连队，除获得了“人民功臣第一连”的光荣称号外，又荣膺了八个大功班和一个荣誉排的光荣称号。连里有一个特等功臣，二个华东人民英雄，一个战斗模范，三个工作模范和七十八个四等功以上的人民功臣。全连有一百零二个共产党员。我们向您们保证：我们决不骄傲自满，一定虚心学习，保持我们红军、党员、人民英雄、人民功臣的光荣和优秀品质。我们要和兄弟部队一起，坚决解放台湾，打败美国侵略者，坚决捍卫祖国、巩固国防！敬祝您们身体健康！        三野“人民功臣第一连”全体指战员
    七月二十六日
