　　Solving the Difficulty of Paper Pulp Shortage
    State-Run Kaishantun Paper Mill Resumes Production
    Producing Over Thirty Tons of Sulfite Wood Pulp Daily
    [Our Dispatch] The state-run Kaishantun Paper Mill, located on the banks of the Tumen River on the northeastern border, officially resumed production on July 20th. It produces over thirty tons of sulfite wood pulp daily. The mill possesses modern, high-speed cooking equipment, a massive high-pressure recovery boiler, and an intermediate circulating wood digester, as well as a complete set of water treatment and power equipment. Through the efforts of all workers, the mill completed the state-assigned production task for July ahead of schedule on July 28th. The product quality is entirely first-class and has already begun to supply the needs of paper mills in Jilin, Shenyang, and other places. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the mill produced rayon pulp and had a production capacity of fifty tons per day, making it the largest pulp mill in the Northeast. The mill's buildings and equipment suffered severe damage during the recovery. Sulfite paper pulp is extremely scarce in our country, and a large amount of foreign exchange is spent each year to purchase it from foreign countries. Therefore, the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department decided to restore the Kaishantun Paper Mill to manufacture sulfite paper pulp. Construction began in July of last year. After a year of efforts by workers and technicians, a total of seventy-six new collective and individual records were created, overcoming various difficulties in materials and transportation. The basic components of the pulp-making equipment and power equipment were repaired by June of this year, and trial production began in mid-June. The first batch of sulfite paper pulp was released on "July 1st." Afterwards, after repeated inspections and modifications to address substandard quality issues in the power and machinery, formal production began on July 20th. The mill is currently conducting a major security inspection and establishing quota management, and is preparing to implement a production instruction chart system to further improve production.
