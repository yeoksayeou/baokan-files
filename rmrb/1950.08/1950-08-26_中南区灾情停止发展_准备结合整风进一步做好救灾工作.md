Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 24th: The disaster situation in the Central-South region since the beginning of summer has ceased to develop after the region's people's governments at all levels led the farmers to conduct emergency rescue work. In this disaster relief work, in addition to reducing and exempting more than 40 million jin of summer public grain for farmers in disaster areas, the people's governments at all levels in the Central-South region successively issued over 210 million jin of relief grain and loan grain to help disaster-stricken farmers resolve difficulties in life and production.

Since overcoming the spring famine this year, farmers in the Central-South region experienced new disasters such as floods, droughts, and insects in June and July. The affected area in the entire region was approximately 20 million mu. After the disasters occurred, local people's governments promptly took emergency measures for disaster relief, overcame the pessimistic ideas of the victims, and vigorously organized the disaster victims to fight against the disaster. For example, after floods occurred in some areas of Henan Province, the affected special districts and counties immediately convened emergency meetings on flood prevention, established various forms of disaster relief organizations, and actively rescued disaster victims. Farmers in Ningling County, Henan Province, dug 40 ditches within six or seven days after the flood, allowing all of the more than 40,000 mu of land flooded in the county to drain. After draining the accumulated water, farmers in Xiaogan Special District, Hubei Province, have now replanted more than 18,000 shi of late autumn crops. At present, in addition to continuing to organize forces in some severely affected areas in the aforementioned two provinces to carry out drainage, damming, and replanting, other areas along the river have victoriously overcome the disaster and have begun to repair and inspect embankments to prevent autumn floods. Parts of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces experienced droughts in June and July, and now have had widespread rainfall, and the disaster situation has stopped developing. Hubei and Hunan provinces have convened emergency meetings on drought prevention to deploy drought resistance work. In mid-July, Cheng Xingling, Tan Yubao, vice chairmen of the Hunan Provincial People's Government, and the directors of various departments personally led five disaster relief teams to go deep into the disaster areas, organize the masses to water and prevent drought, and conduct emergency relief and condolences to the disaster victims. Jiujiang, Xiushui and other counties in Jiangxi Province made full use of the accumulated water in ponds and river dams, and mobilized the masses to water to fight drought, and have now saved all 90,000 mu of drought-stricken fields. Locust plagues were discovered in Yiyang, Yichuan, and other four counties in Henan Province in June and July. The people's governments of the aforementioned counties immediately established locust eradication headquarters with districts as the center, and mobilized more than 100,000 farmers to participate in the locust catching campaign. At present, the insect disaster there has basically stopped spreading.

In order to further improve the future disaster relief work, the people's governments at all levels in the Central-South region have decided to use the current cadre rectification movement to summarize the work, criticize the complacency of some cadres regarding disaster relief work, and the bureaucratic work style of not conducting in-depth investigations and research on the disaster situation. At the same time, they will educate all cadres to establish a long-term perspective on disaster prevention.

　　中南区灾情停止发展
    准备结合整风进一步做好救灾工作
    【新华社汉口二十四日电】中南区进入夏季以来所发生的灾情，经该区各级人民政府领导农民抢救后，目前已停止发展。在这次救灾工作中，中南区各级人民政府除减免灾区农民夏季公粮四千余万斤以外，并先后发出救济粮和贷粮二亿一千余万斤，帮助受灾农民解除生活和生产中的困难。
    中南区农民自战胜今年春荒以后，六、七两月又发生水、旱、虫等新的灾害。全区受灾面积约二千万亩。灾情发生以后，各地人民政府均及时采取了救灾的紧急措施，克服了灾民的悲观思想，大力组织灾民与灾荒斗争。如河南省部分地区发生水灾后，各受灾专署及县立即召开了防水紧急会议，成立了各种形式的救灾组织，积极抢救灾民。该省宁陵县农民在水灾发生后六、七天内，即挖沟四十条，使该县被水淹没的四万多亩地全部出水。湖北省孝感专区农民排除积水以后，现已补种上晚秋作物一万八千余石。目前上述两省除部分重灾区还继续组织力量，进行排水、堵口及抢种外，其他沿河地区已胜利地度过灾荒，并已开始培修和检查堤工，以预防秋汛。湖北、湖南、江西三省部分地区，六、七月间都曾发生旱灾，现已普遍降雨，灾情停止发展。湖北、湖南两省都曾召开防旱紧急会议，布置抗旱工作。湖南省人民政府副主席程星龄、谭余保及各厅厅长在七月中旬曾亲率五个救灾小组，深入灾区，组织群众车水防旱，并进行了对灾民的急赈和慰问。江西省九江、修水等县更充分利用池塘、河坝的积水，发动群众车水抗旱，现已救出全部旱田九万余亩。河南省宜阳、伊川等四县六、七月间曾发现蝗虫为害。上述各县人民政府立即以区为中心成立了剿蝗指挥部，发动十余万农民参加捕蝗运动。现该处虫灾已基本上停止蔓延。
    为了进一步做好今后的救灾工作，中南区各级人民政府均决定通过现在正在进行的干部整风运动，总结工作，批评部分干部对救灾工作的麻痹思想和不深入调查研究灾情等官僚主义的工作作风。同时教育全体干部树立长期防灾的观点。
