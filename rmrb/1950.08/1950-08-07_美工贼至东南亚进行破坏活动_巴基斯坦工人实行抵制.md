Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: According to a report from the Electric News Agency correspondent in Karachi: The laboring people of Pakistan have implemented a boycott of a delegation of international labor scabs from the so-called "Free Trade Unions," who recently arrived in Karachi. In the industrial center, which has between 20,000 and 30,000 workers, only a few people participated in the conference organized by the reactionary "union leaders."

When discussing the arrival of this group of international labor scabs in Karachi, the Secretary of the Sindh Provincial Trade Union Committee, Subair, emphasized: The "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" is nothing more than a special agent of Wall Street. Its purpose is to divide the true trade union movement by establishing puppet trade unions around the world.

Subair called on the workers to boycott this delegation and to unite their ranks more closely around the Pakistan Trade Union Federation.

　　美工贼至东南亚进行破坏活动
    巴基斯坦工人实行抵制
    【新华社五日讯】据电通社驻喀喇蚩记者报道：巴基斯坦劳动人民，对最近到达喀喇蚩的所谓“自由工会”的一群国际工贼们的代表团，已经实行抵制。在拥有二万到三万工人的工业中心，只有几个人参加了反动的“工会领袖们”所组织的大会。
    信地省工会委员会书记苏拜尔在论及这批国际工贼到达喀喇蚩一事时着重指出：“国际自由工会联合会”不过是华尔街的特务机关罢了，它的宗旨是以在全世界建立傀儡工会的手段，来分化真正的工会运动。
    苏拜尔号召工人们对这个代表团实行抵制，并把自己的队伍更紧密地团结在巴基斯坦工会联合会的周围。
