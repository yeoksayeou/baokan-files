　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th: Guangzhou Christian representatives Murong Xian (Bishop of the South China Diocese of the Chinese Sheng Kung Hui), Tan Qingxin (President of the Union Theological College of Lingnan University), Li Zhuo(? missing character, President of the Guangzhou YWCA), and 22 others jointly issued a statement on the 23rd of this month protesting the US imperialist aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Korea. The statement said: After suffering serious blows from the Korean People's Army, the US imperialists are frantically using aircraft to bomb and strafe peaceful cities in the Korean rear, massacring the elderly, the weak, children, and women of Korea on a large scale. Many houses, schools, hospitals, and cultural institutions in the cities of Seoul, Wonsan, and Pyongyang have been destroyed by bombing. We Christians express our infinite indignation at the inhuman and unreasonable barbaric acts of US imperialism in Korea and hereby lodge a serious protest. We fully support Foreign Minister Park Heon-yeong of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's August 5th statement, and the proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue put forward by Soviet representative Malik in the United Nations Security Council, as well as the proposal to stop the US imperialist's barbaric bombing in Korea. We appeal to Christians and peace-loving people around the world to resolutely uphold justice, support the just struggle of the Korean people against US imperialism, and demand that the Security Council take swift action to stop the US imperialist's massacres in Korea. We Christians firmly believe that the unparalleled unity of the powerful world democratic forces led by the Soviet Union will surely defend world peace and defeat any aggression by US imperialism.

　　广州基督教徒发表声明
    抗议美机滥炸朝鲜
    【新华社广州三十日电】广州市基督教代表人物慕容贤（中华圣公会华南教区主教）谭庆心（岭南大学协和神学院院长）李卓?（广州基督教女青年会会长）等二十五人于本月二十三日联名发表声明，抗议美帝国主义飞机滥炸朝鲜的暴行。该声明称：美帝国主义者在遭受到朝鲜人民军的严重打击后，正疯狂地用飞机轰炸和扫射朝鲜后方和平城市，大规模屠杀朝鲜的老弱、儿童和妇女。汉城、元山、平壤各城市的许多住屋、学校、医院和文化机关都被炸毁了。我们基督教徒对美帝国主义在朝鲜这种违反人道，不顾公理的野蛮暴行，表示无限义愤，特提出严重抗议。我们完全拥护朝鲜民主主义人民共和国朴宪永外长八月五日的声明，和苏联代表马立克在联合国安理会所提出和平解决朝鲜问题的提案，及制止美帝在朝鲜野蛮轰炸的提案。我们向全世界基督教徒与爱好和平人士呼吁，坚决维护公理，声援朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争，并要求安理会迅速采取行动，制止美帝在朝鲜屠杀的暴行。我们基督教徒深信以苏联为首的强大的世界民主力量的无比团结，一定能保卫世界和平，打败美帝的任何侵略行动。
