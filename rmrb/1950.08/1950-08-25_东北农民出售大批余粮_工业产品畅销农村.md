Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 23rd: In the past two months, the amount of surplus grain sold by farmers in Northeast China has been increasing daily, and trade between urban and rural areas has become very active.

From June to August 14th, the Northeast China Grain Company has purchased more than 300,400 tons of grain, for which it has paid nearly 800 billion yuan in cash (Northeast currency) in June and July alone.

Northeast farmers have a large surplus of grain this year. In order to enable farmers to sell their surplus grain, the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government relaxed grain purchase standards at the end of June and increased the proportion of cash payments for grain purchases. Farmers, seeing the promising wheat harvest this year, sold most of their surplus grain. In mid-June, the average daily purchase of grain in various places was about 2,000 tons, which has gradually increased to more than 7,000 tons per day. A large amount of cash has flowed into rural areas with the purchase of surplus grain, and the rural economy has become active, changing the phenomenon of severe currency shortages before grain purchases, where grain was needed to buy things and seek medical treatment. Farmers in grain-producing areas, after selling their grain, have surplus money in hand in addition to buying back urgently needed items, and many farmers are building houses and preparing winter clothing. Due to the increased purchasing power of farmers, state-owned industrial products have been selling well. The sales revenue of industrial products in various counties of Songjiang Province has generally increased by two times compared with before the grain purchase. From July to August 6th, the department store of the province sold industrial products worth 208.8 billion yuan, of which materials exchanged for grain accounted for more than 55 billion yuan. The province's grain company also allocated 2,270 tons of edible salt, 720 tons of bean cake, 187 tons of soybean oil, and 240 tons of flour to directly exchange for farmers' surplus grain.

Most of the grain purchase work in Northeast China is carried out through cooperatives. Grain companies in various places have mostly signed grain purchase contracts with cooperatives. The grain purchased by cooperatives on behalf of the grain company accounts for the vast majority of the grain company's purchases. For example, as of August 6th, cooperatives in Songjiang Province had collected a total of more than 24,200 tons of grain for the state, accounting for about 80 percent of the province's total grain purchase.

　　东北农民出售大批余粮
    工业产品畅销农村
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】东北各地农民出售余粮的数字两个月来日见增加，城乡贸易大为活跃。
    东北区粮食公司自六月起至八月十四日止，已收购粮食达三十万零四千余吨；为此付出的现金，六、七两月即近八千亿元（东北币，下同）。
    东北农民今年拥有大批余粮。东北人民政府贸易部为使农民余粮能够脱售，六月末即放宽购粮标准，同时并增加了购粮现金比例。农民因见今年小麦丰收有望，多将全部余粮出售。六月中旬各地购粮平均每天两千吨左右，现已逐渐增加到每天七千余吨。大量现金随着余粮的收购流入农村，农村经济已形活跃，改变了购粮前货币奇缺，买东西治病都得用粮食的现象。产粮区的农民在卖出粮食后，除买回急需物品外，手边都存有余钱，很多农民正在修建房屋，准备冬衣。由于农民购买力提高，国营工业产品已得以畅销。松江省各县销售工业产品的卖钱额，比购粮前普遍增加了两倍。该省百货公司自七月至八月六日止，共推销了价值二千零八十八亿元的工业产品，其中交换粮食的物资占五百五十余亿元。该省粮食公司并拨出食盐二千二百七十吨，豆饼七百二十吨，豆油一百八十七吨，面粉二百四十吨，直接交换农民余粮。
    东北各地的购粮工作大部分是通过合作社来进行的，各地粮食公司大都与合作社订有购粮合同。合作社代购的粮食，占粮食公司购粮数量的绝大部分。如松江省全省合作社至八月六日止，即共为国家收粮二万四千二百余吨，约为该省购粮总数的百分之八十。
