"Beijing Young Pioneers" Issue No. 55 Published

Issue No. 55 of "Beijing Young Pioneers" was published on August 9th. This issue is very rich in content. "Yesterday's Story" tells children that they should finish things on the day they are due, otherwise they will lose that day forever and never find it again. This story is not only good in content, but also very interestingly written. "Little Hero Li Xiaoquan" is a story about a real heroic young Eighth Route Army soldier. "Carrots and Sweet Potatoes" is a science story introducing how Chinese farmers are creating new plants.

Regarding children's summer vacation life, there is a poem and painting "Little Hua Hua in Children's Paradise"; an article "Happy Young Pioneer Camp"; and an article about the activities of the Young Pioneer Team of the Third District Central Elementary School, "Together with Korean Children." In addition, there is also a children's song "Planting Watermelons" and two small games.
