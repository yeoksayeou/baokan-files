　　An Unshakeable Force for Peace
    A Reporter's Account of Following the Propaganda Team of Renmin University of China
    Su Xing
    Our propaganda team from Renmin University of China has been conducting propaganda work in Beijing city and its suburbs for several days and has been warmly welcomed by the people everywhere.

    Workers and farmers are very concerned about news from Taiwan and Korea. At the train station and on the streets, I saw many slogans, cartoons, and blackboard bulletins with large characters proclaiming the news of the Korean people's victory. Many villages have held mass meetings against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. The Mentougou area held a mass meeting of several thousand people the night before the propaganda team arrived. Han Zhankui, the director of the third branch of the Xiaoyao Miners' Union, and another worker comrade worked all night to draw more than twenty cartoons and write big-character posters to put up. Wang Baokui, a committee member of the fifth branch of the Xiaoyao Miners' Union, said: "We have held a mass meeting, and we will also discuss it in small groups. Propaganda is everyone's business. One person tells ten, and ten people tell a hundred; everyone's propaganda is more powerful than one person's."

    In Nanyuan, Comrade Zhao Jianhua, the director of the preparatory committee of the 14th district farmers' association, told me: "The farmers are all looking forward to the early liberation of Taiwan, which can be seen in their enthusiastic efforts to hand in public grain this time."

    On the peace signature books, I saw workers, farmers, and soldiers writing their names; even sixty-year-old women and innocent, lively children also wrote their names.

    Defending peace is not only because workers and farmers cherish today's life, but also because they have deep memories: "We will not forget the imperialist robbers."

    A miner from Mentougou said: "The Communist Party came, and we were liberated. Which worker wants to suffer like they did in the past? We resolutely oppose American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Korea!" An old kiln worker surnamed An, who has been working for nearly thirty years, remembers the past days well. He said: "The Japanese made people suffer greatly here. 1943 was the hardest year. The workers had no food to eat, and many people starved to death! People were lying on the streets, unable to get up because they were so hungry.... When the Kuomintang came, it was the same. The workers had no freedom at all; it was truly a life of beasts of burden...." What about now? The workers have become masters, organized trade unions, and set up cooperatives. After work, they can go to spare-time schools and have their own reading groups. Wang Deku, a miner who has been working since he was fourteen and is now only twenty-two years old, said: "After liberation, we stood up. We have our own organizations, and we have the opportunity to study culture." He said that workers are all opposed to the American invasion of Taiwan and Korea.

    Peace is the hope of millions of people. On the way, we saw: construction workers had just laid the roof of the factory building, the chimneys of power plants and steel mills were emitting black smoke, sorghum was earing, sesame was blooming, and golden rice waves floated in the rice fields of the Nanyuan Farm.... This is the basis for our love of peace.

    All the farmers in the 14th district of Nanyuan sent a telegram to General Kim Il-sung to support Korea's just war of liberation. There was a sentence in the telegram that said: "Chinese farmers do not want war, but we are not afraid of war. If the American imperialists continue to invade the Chinese people, we will surely wipe them out cleanly, completely, and thoroughly." Workers and farmers not only have a sincere desire for peace, but also have a confidence as strong as steel. American imperialism has met with the greatest contempt in the eyes of the Chinese people. Miner Li Xiu said: "American imperialism is just a paper tiger. It is losing its helmet and armor in Korea and still wants to invade Taiwan! It is courting death."

    In Nanyuan, there is a seventy-seven-year-old man named Yang Chengqi. His eldest son works at the airport, and his second son is in the navy in Qingdao. He said that he has been here since Nanyuan was opened up, watching the houses being built one by one and the children growing up day by day. He has experienced many wars and seen many imperialist robbers, but they have all been defeated by the people.

    Then, he said: "Now the people have won. As long as everyone is united, we can protect our ironclad country." An old military family woman from Sanjiadian, who is sixty-one years old, said confidently: "Everyone wants to live a good life, and our people are all of one heart; no reactionaries will succeed!"

    Cao Jianrong, a farmer representative from Nanyuan, said: "We will all sign to oppose war. Everyone signing is the greatest strength. We will scare the imperialists even without fighting. We farmers will definitely actively produce, hand in public grain, support the capture of Taiwan, and also support the Korean people." The worker representative of Military Factory No. 5 said: "The United States is invading Taiwan and Korea, vainly trying to seize the fruits of the people's victory. We will not allow it to move. The workers will definitely step up production, increase quantity, and improve quality to support the liberation of Taiwan. We Chinese workers firmly support the Korean people!"

    I have seen the hardworking and brave Chinese people—an unshakeable force for peace!

### 坚强无比的和平力量  中国人民大学宣传队随行记

　　坚强无比的和平力量
    中国人民大学宣传队随行记
    苏星
    我们中国人民大学的宣传队，在北京城内和郊区作了几天宣传，到处受到人民热烈的欢迎。
    工人和农民们非常关心着台湾和朝鲜的消息。在车站上、街道上，我看见了许多标语、漫画以及黑板报上大字写着的朝鲜人民胜利的消息。很多村里都开了反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜的大会。门头沟在宣传队到达的前一晚上曾开了一个几千人的群众大会。小窑工会第三支会的主任韩占魁和另外一个工人同志连夜画了二十多张漫画、写了大字报贴出来。小窑工会第五支会的委员王保魁说：“我们开了大会，还要在小组里讨论。宣传是大伙的事，一个传十，十个传百；大家宣传比一个人宣传的力量大。”
    在南苑，十四区农民协会筹委会主任赵建华同志告诉我：“农民都盼着早日解放台湾，在这次缴公粮这股踊跃劲儿就可看得出来。”
    在和平签名书上，我看见工人、农民、战士写着他们的名字；连六十岁的老大娘，天真活泼的孩子们也都写上了他们的名字。
    保卫和平，不仅因为工人和农民们珍爱今天的生活，而且他们有着深刻的记忆：“我们不会忘掉帝国主义强盗的。”
    门头沟的一个矿工说：“共产党来了，我们得到解放了。工人们谁愿意像过去那样受罪呢？我们坚决反对美帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜！”一个作工将近三十年的姓安的老窑工，他牢记着过去的日子。他说：“日本在这儿人们受罪可大了，民国三十二年是最苦的一年，工人们没有粮食吃，饿死了多少人哪！在大街上就横躺竖卧着饿得起不来的人……。国民党来了，还是一样，工人没有一点自由，真是牛马生活……。”如今呢？工人们当了主人，组织了工会设立了合作社，下了工可以上业余学校，还有自己的读报组。从十四岁就作工、现在才二十二岁的矿工王德库说：“解放以后，我们翻了身。我们有了自己的组织，我们有了学习文化的机会。”他说：美国侵略台湾、朝鲜，工人没有不反对的。
    和平，这是千百万人的希望。在途中，我们看到：建筑工人刚铺好厂房的屋顶，发电厂、炼钢厂的烟突冒着黑烟，高粱抽穗了，芝麻正开花，南苑农场的稻田里浮着金黄色的稻浪……，这就是我们爱好和平的根据。
    南苑十四区的全体农民，为了支援朝鲜的正义的解放战争，曾给金日成将军一封通电。通电里面有这样一句话：“中国农民是不愿意战争的，但是我们并不怕战争。如果美帝国主义者继续侵略中国人民，我们一定把他们干净、完全、彻底的消灭。”工人和农民们不但有着真诚的和平的愿望，而且有着钢铁一般的信心。美帝国主义在中国人民的眼睛里遭到了最大的卑视。矿工李秀说：“美帝国主义就是一只纸老虎。它在朝鲜打的丢盔撇甲，还想侵略台湾！它是找死。”
    在南苑有一个七十七岁的老汉杨承起，他的大儿子在飞机场工作，二儿子在青岛当海军。他说，他从南苑开辟那天就在这里，亲眼看着一所所的房子盖起来，孩子们一天天长大。他经历了多少次战争，看见了多少帝国主义的强盗行为，但是它们都被人民打倒了。
    接着，他又说：“现在人民胜利了。咱们只要人人齐心，就能保住铁打的江山。”三家店一位六十一岁的军属大娘满怀信心地说：“人人都愿意过好日子，咱们人民都一个心；反动派谁也不行！”
    南苑的农民代表曹建荣说：“我们都要签名反对战争，人人签名就是最大的力量，不用打就把帝国主义吓坏了。我们农民们一定积极生产，缴好公粮，支援打下台湾，还要支援朝鲜人民。”军工五厂的工人代表说：“美国侵略台湾、朝鲜，妄想夺人民的胜利果实，我们不许它动。工人们一定加紧生产，增加数量，提高质量，支援解放台湾。我们中国工人是坚决声援朝鲜人民的！”
    我看到了勤劳勇敢的中国人民——坚强无比的和平力量！
