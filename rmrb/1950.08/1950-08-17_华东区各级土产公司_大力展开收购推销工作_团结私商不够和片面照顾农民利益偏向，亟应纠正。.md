Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th. Since the official establishment of state-owned local product companies at all levels in the East China region in late May, great achievements have been made in purchasing and sales work. According to incomplete statistics, in June and July, local product companies at all levels in the East China region have purchased more than 100 kinds of products, including tobacco leaves, hemp bark, alum, rapeseed, silkworm cocoons, various hand-woven products, embroidery, mountain goods, and fruits, with a total value of approximately 130 billion RMB. While purchasing, companies in various regions have also actively expanded sales work through various methods. According to statistics from 40 days in June to early July, more than one-third of the purchased local products have been adjusted among various provinces and regions domestically. In addition, 8,000 tons of bean cake and 5,600 tons of fertilizer powder were supplied to farmers for summer hoeing and fertilization. In order to solve the difficulty of food shortage for farmers, the Shandong Provincial Company exchanged 8.5 million catties of coarse grains with farmers for local products, which was welcomed by the majority of farmers.

Local product companies in various parts of East China have focused on taking care of the regions in purchasing local products and have tried their best to open up sales channels for sideline products produced by disaster victims in production for self-salvation. However, at the same time, a bias of one-sidedly taking care of the interests of farmers has also generally occurred. For example, the Subei Branch Company purchased vermicelli at a price that lost one catty of grain per catty; the vermicelli purchased by the Wanbei Branch Company was mostly of poor quality and difficult to sell, which also caused considerable losses to state assets. More seriously, individual branch companies under the Sunan Branch Company even stipulated that they would only purchase products from hired poor peasants, which aroused dissatisfaction among other working people in the countryside. As a result, the company's original purchase task, which was scheduled to be completed in seven days, was not completed even after fifteen days. In addition, the most important shortcoming in organizing the purchase of local products by local product companies at all levels in the East China region in the past two months is the insufficient understanding of the policy of "uniting private merchants for operation." This is manifested in the fact that, on the one hand, instead of concentrating efforts to control major local products based on the tasks of "adjusting supply and demand" and "stabilizing prices" and their own operating capabilities, they blindly expanded the types of operations from a one-sided profit-seeking perspective, dispersing their strength, so that when the prices of major local products fluctuated in the market, they could not play a stabilizing role; on the other hand, many cadres still have one-sided views in their thinking, raising purchase prices too high, not allowing private merchants to make profits, thus打击ing the transportation and sales of local products. The above-mentioned shortcomings and biases have been criticized and corrected at the joint conference of managers of branch companies at all levels under the East China Regional Company in late July.

　　华东区各级土产公司
    大力展开收购推销工作
    团结私商不够和片面照顾农民利益偏向，亟应纠正。
    【新华社上海十四日电】华东区各级国营土产公司五月下旬正式建立后，在收购和推销工作上已获得很大成绩。据不完全统计，华东区各级土产公司六、七两个月中已收购的烟叶、麻皮、明矾，代购的菜籽、蚕茧及其他各种手工编织品、刺绣品、山货、水果等一百多种，共值人民币约一千三百多亿元。各地公司在收购同时，并以各种方法积极展开推销工作。据六月至七月上旬四十天的统计，所收购的土产品有三分之一以上已在国内各省区之间进行了调剂，此外并以八千吨豆饼、五千六百吨肥田粉供应农民夏锄施肥。山东省公司为了解决农民缺粮的困难，曾以八百五十万斤粗粮向农民交换土产，受到广大农民的欢迎。
    华东各地土产公司在收购土产中有重点地照顾了地区，并尽力为灾民在生产自救中所生产的副业产品开辟销路。但同时也普遍发生了片面照顾农民利益的偏向。如苏北分公司以每斤赔本一斤粮食的价格收购粉丝；皖北分公司所收购的粉丝因大部品质低劣，不易销售，也使国家资财受到不少损失。更严重的是苏南分公司所属个别支公司，竟规定只收雇贫农的产品，引起了农村中其他劳动群众的不满，结果该公司原定七天完成的收购任务，延迟了十五天也没有完成。此外，华东区各级土产公司两个月来在组织土产收购中所发生的最主要缺点是对“团结私商经营”的政策认识不够。这表现在一方面不是根据“调剂供求”、“稳定物价”的任务和本身经营能力，集中力量去掌握主要的土产品，而是从片面的盈利观点出发盲目扩大经营种类，分散了力量，以致市场上主要土产品的价格发生波动时，不能起稳定的作用；另一方面，不少干部在思想上还存在着片面的看法，把收购价格提得过高，不让私商有利可图，因而打击了土产的运销事业。上述缺点和偏向，在七月下旬华东区公司所属各级分、支公司经理联席会议上已受到批判和纠正。
