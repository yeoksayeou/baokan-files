　　Northeast Mechanical Bureau Leadership Has Shortcomings in Production
    Northeast Advanced Producer Zhang Shangju Offers Criticism
    [This newspaper’s dispatch] This newspaper’s special correspondent, Northeast advanced producer Zhang Shangju reports: Why did the No. 3 Machine Factory in Shenyang slightly exceed its production tasks in the second quarter? Why was the quality not entirely good? Why was the first half of the month spent waiting for work and materials, and the second half spent frantically busy? Whose responsibility is this?

    I am the founder of the No. 3 Machine Factory’s "Root Cause Report." The purpose of this report is to track down and inspect the responsibility system. In the past, our factory's assembly workshop suffered from material shortages every month, greatly affecting production. At my suggestion, the trade union established a "Root Cause Blackboard," writing the material shortage situation on the blackboard to pursue responsibility. This method has been very effective since its implementation, and the product quality has improved compared to the past. In the first quarter, not a single standard-grade product was assembled; in the second quarter, when making six-foot boxcar lathes, not only was the quantity exceeded by five units (the task was fifty-five units), but twenty-three standard-grade products were also produced, in addition to exceeding the completion of six eight-foot belt lathes. If it were not for the impact of waiting for work and materials, even more standard products could have been produced, and the task could have been exceeded even more.

    This year, the No. 3 Factory's production task is several hundred boxcar lathes. The Mechanical Bureau said that the required raw materials should be ordered uniformly by the bureau, and the factories cannot purchase them from outside at will. The No. 3 Factory's Managerial Section reported to the Mechanical Bureau five times, requesting the bureau to order ball bearings, and the bureau finally approved it, ordering them uniformly from the Wafangdian Ball Bearing Factory. In March, the factory sent someone to the ball bearing factory to retrieve sixty sets, but after inspection by the assembly workshop, not a single set was qualified. It turned out that when the Mechanical Bureau ordered from the ball bearing factory, it did not specify that they were for use in master machines. The ball bearing factory made them according to the ball bearings used in ordinary machine tools. The No. 3 Factory had no choice but to send the ball bearings back to the ball bearing factory. In March, April, and May, the No. 3 Factory bought ball bearings from hardware stores in the city, but most of the ball bearings purchased were still unqualified. Therefore, the lathes produced were all first-class products in other parts, but the ball bearing part was not up to standard. On June 12, Han, the director of the Mechanical Bureau, gave Director Zhao of the Wafangdian Ball Bearing Factory an order, and the ball bearing factory promised to make standard ball bearings for master machines by the 18th. When the No. 3 Factory sent someone to the ball bearing factory to retrieve them, it was already June 20. The assembly workshop then began to assemble the headstocks, and by the end of the month, thirty units were assembled (the administrative task was twenty units). After inspection by the bureau, nine units were substandard. Because it was the end of the month and there was no time to repair them, only twenty-one units were handed over. It should have exceeded the task by ten units, but now it only exceeded by one unit, and the workers were very unhappy, reflecting: "At the beginning of the month, we are idle as hell, and at the end of the month, we are busy to death."

    On June 20, Zhao, the director of the Wafangdian Ball Bearing Factory, wrote a letter to the Manufacturing Section of the Mechanical Bureau, asking the Manufacturing Section to quickly give the ball bearing factory an order to make ball bearings for the No. 3 Factory. The Managerial Section of the No. 3 Factory also submitted a report to Section Chief Xie of the Production Department of the Mechanical Bureau regarding the number of ball bearings needed in July. On June 24, the No. 3 Factory officially submitted a document to the Production Department of the Mechanical Bureau requesting the purchase of ball bearings. Director Xie wrote on the document: "You go find Section Chief Zang of the Manufacturing Section"; Section Chief Zang wrote on the document: An order has already been given to the ball bearing factory, guaranteeing that the No. 3 Factory will not have to wait for materials for ball bearings in July. On June 27, when the No. 3 Factory contacted Director Zhao of the Wafangdian Ball Bearing Factory, the ball bearing factory replied: "Regarding the manufacture of ball bearings urgently needed by your factory in July, because the notice from the bureau did not specify the size and quantity of your factory's order, please ask your factory to explain the specifications and quantity to the bureau, and inform our factory so that we can rush to make them." After receiving the letter, the Managerial Section of the No. 3 Factory immediately took the ball bearing factory's letter to the Mechanical Bureau to find Section Chief Zang. After reading the letter, Section Chief Zang said: "No problem, when Director Zhao of the ball bearing factory came to the bureau for a meeting the day before yesterday, I already talked to him, guaranteeing that one hundred sets will be completed by July 10." The No. 3 Factory then sent Lin Guanghui of the Managerial Section to Wafangdian to wait, so that he could bring the ball bearings back after they were made. Who knew that when Lin Guanghui arrived at the ball bearing factory, Director Zhao of the ball bearing factory said: "Section Chief Zang of the Mechanical Bureau did not give us any orders or instructions at all, nor did he talk to me face-to-face." After Lin Guanghui called back to report the situation, the Managerial Section immediately went to the Manufacturing Section of the Mechanical Bureau to find Section Chief Zang; Section Chief Zang then made a long-distance call to Wafangdian, asking the ball bearing factory to make ball bearings for the No. 3 Factory for use in July. Because it was too late, the required ball bearings could not be manufactured until July 20.

    Who caused the No. 3 Factory to wait for materials every month, the quality to be low, and the task not to be exceeded? Who is responsible for the travel expenses of the No. 3 Factory sending people back and forth to Wafangdian six times in June and July, and the huge losses caused to the country due to waiting for materials? I hope to strictly track down and inspect responsibility.

    Editor's Note: After the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government instructed state-owned factories and mines to establish a production responsibility system, it was enthusiastically responded to by workers in various parts of Northeast China, and the responsibility system has been generally established and gradually improved. However, some responsible cadres of the Mechanical Bureau, which leads the mechanical industry in the entire Northeast region, have so neglected their duties, seriously affecting production, and causing huge waste of state property. This is absolutely not allowed. The Northeast Mechanical Industry Bureau, in this rectification movement, should combine this issue raised by Comrade Zhang Shangju, conduct in-depth inspections, and earnestly change its leadership methods and style towards its subordinate factories in order to improve production work.

　　东北机械局领导生产有缺点
    东北先进生产者张尚举提出批评
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员、东北先进生产者张尚举报道：沈阳第三机器厂第二季生产为什么任务超过的少？质量不完全好？前半月总在等工待料，后半月忙的要命，又是谁的责任？
    我是第三机器厂《追根报》的创始人，该报目的就是追根检查责任制。过去我厂装配场月月发生待料，影响生产很大。经我提议，工会建立了追根黑板报，将待料情形写在追根黑板报上追求责任。这办法实行后，收效很好，产品质量比过去是提高了。在第一季没有装出一台标级品；第二季作六尺闷罐车床，不光数量超过五台（任务是五十五台），还出了二十三台标级品，另外超过完成六台八尺皮带车床。要没有等工待料影响的话，还可作出更多的标准品，更多的超过任务。
    今年三厂的生产任务是数百台闷罐车床。机械局说需用原材料由局统一订货，各工厂不能随意向外购买。三厂经理科向机械局报表五次，呈请局里给订滚珠，局方才批准，由局统一向瓦房店滚珠厂订货。三月份本厂派人到滚珠厂取来六十套，经装配场检查，一套合格品也没有。原来机械局向滚珠厂订货时，并没有说明是作母机用，滚珠厂照普通机床用的滚珠作的，三厂只好又派人把滚珠送回滚珠厂去。三、四、五月份三厂就在本市五金行买滚珠用，结果买来的大部分还是不合格的多。所以作出的床子，其他地方都是一级品，就是滚珠部分不够标准。六月十二日，机械局韩局长又给瓦房店滚珠厂赵厂长下命令，滚珠厂答应于十八日给作好母机用的标准滚珠。到时，三厂派人到滚珠厂去取，取回来时已是六月二十日了。装配场这才开始装床头，到月底装出三十台（行政任务二十台），经局里检查有九台下级品，因已到月底来不及修理，只好交出二十一台。理应超过十台任务，现在只超过一台，工友很不高兴，反映说：“月初闲得要命，月底忙个要死。”
    六月二十日，瓦房店滚珠厂赵厂长给机械局制造科写信，请该局制造科赶快给滚珠厂下命令，好再为三厂做滚珠。三厂经理科也同时向机械局生产处谢处长呈报了七月份需用的滚珠数。六月二十四日，三厂又用公文正式到机械局生产处呈请订购滚珠，谢局长批：“你去找制造科臧科长”；臧科长就在公文上批道：已经给滚珠厂下命令了，保证三厂七月份滚珠不要待料。六月二十七日，三厂给瓦房店滚珠厂赵厂长去信连络时，滚珠厂的回信说：“关于给你厂制造七月份急需用的滚珠，因局里来的通知，并未指出你厂订制的规格多大和数目多少，请你厂给局里说明规格及数量，转知我厂以便赶制。”三厂接到信后，经理科马上拿着滚珠厂的来信去机械局找臧科长，臧科长看信后，还说：“没问题，前天滚珠厂赵厂长来局开会时，我已经和他谈过了，保证七月十日完成一百套。三厂当时就派经理科林广会到瓦房店去等着，以便滚珠做好后好往回拿。谁知林广会到滚珠厂时，滚珠厂赵厂长说：“机械局臧科长根本没给我们命令和指示，也没和我当面谈过”。林广会由瓦房店打回长途电话说明情况后，经理科马上又去找机械局制造科臧科长；臧科长这才给瓦房店打长途电话要滚珠厂给三厂作七月份用的滚珠。因为时间已晚，七月二十日才能制造出需用的滚珠。
    三厂月月待料，质量不高，任务不能超过，这是谁给造成的呢？三厂六、七月份派人往返瓦房六次的路费，及因待料造成国家的巨大损失，是谁的责任？我希望严格追根检查责任。
    编者按：东北人民政府工业部指示各国营厂矿建立生产责任制后，获得东北各地工人积极响应，并已普遍建立与逐渐健全了责任制。但领导全东北区机械工业的机械管理局若干负责干部，竟如此忽视职责，严重影响生产，以致造成国家财产的巨大浪费，这是十分不应该的。东北机械工业管理局在此次整风运动中，应结合张尚举同志提出的这一问题，进行深入检查，切实改变对所属各工厂的领导方法及作风，以改进生产工作。
