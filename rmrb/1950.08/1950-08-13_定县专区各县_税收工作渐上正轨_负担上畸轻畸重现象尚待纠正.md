　　Tax Work in Various Counties of Dingxian Special District
    Gradually Gets on the Right Track
    But the Phenomenon of Excessively Light or Heavy Burdens Still Needs to Be Corrected
    [This newspaper's Dingxian dispatch] Tax work in various counties of the Dingxian Special District, Hebei, has gradually gotten on the right track. In the past six months, after extensively and thoroughly publicizing tax policies through people's representative conferences, cadre meetings, and industrial and commercial household meetings, as well as various means such as temple fairs, markets, and blackboards, the industrial and commercial households in the special district have generally been able to understand that paying taxes is a glorious obligation, and the cadres have also basically overcome the bias of being unwilling to do tax work. Therefore, the income from various taxes in the first half of this year increased by more than 136.9% compared with the first half of last year. Although June is a slow month, the income also increased compared to May.
    However, due to the existence of a certain degree of bureaucracy in the work and the lack of investigation and research, it is impossible to grasp all the tax sources, resulting in an unbalanced burden and serious tax evasion. For example, in Qu'yang County, there are more than a dozen villages, because they don't know how many industrial and commercial households there are, they distribute tasks according to the size of the village. This is not only the root cause of the unbalanced burden, but also affects production and operation.
    In addition, in terms of working methods, although the provincial bureau has long instructed that three methods (namely, self-reporting and actual payment combined with account verification, self-reporting, public discussion, typical investigation, and regular fixed amount tax bureau verification) should be used in combination, the special district is still sticking to the old ways, and dare not boldly try it, fearing that it will not be able to complete the task. Until the second quarter of collection, some counties did not conscientiously implement it, and individual counties still had the disadvantage of single-handedness. There is also a lack of a serious and responsible spirit in the work. Violations of collection principles, as well as loss of tickets, loss of funds, and misappropriation of shortfalls in the issuance of invoices for goods tax, have occurred as many as twenty-four or five times in the past six months, according to incomplete statistics.
    In some counties, individual cadres lack a democratic style in their work, and instead of publicizing and explaining policies, they force orders, and some counties have even had detention incidents.
    The above shortcomings and errors have caused some losses to the work. How to strengthen leadership, improve the policy and business level of general cadres, and push the work further is a major issue in the future.

### 定县专区各县  税收工作渐上正轨  负担上畸轻畸重现象尚待纠正

　　定县专区各县
    税收工作渐上正轨
    负担上畸轻畸重现象尚待纠正
    【本报定县讯】河北定县专区各县税收工作已逐渐走上正轨。该专区各县半年来在通过各界人民代表会议、干部会议及工商业户会议以及各种不同的方式，如利用庙会、集市、黑板报等，广泛深入宣传了税收政策后，工商业户一般已能了解纳税是光荣的义务，干部也基本上克服了不愿做税务工作的偏向。因此，今年上半年各项税款收入与去年上半年相较，增加百分之一百三十六点九强。六月份虽系淡月，收入亦较五月份增加。
    但工作中由于存在着某种程度的官僚主义作风，缺乏调查研究，不能掌握全部税源，以致形成了负担不平衡，和严重的漏税现象。如曲阳县有十余个村，因不知有多少工商户，而按村庄大小分配了任务。这不但是造成负担不平衡的根源，且影响了生产和经营。
    另外，在工作方法上，虽然省局早已指示三种方式（即自报实缴配合查账、自报公议典型调查与定期定额税局核定）结合使用，但该专区仍然老一套，不敢大胆试行，怕完不成任务，直到第二季征收时尚有些县未认真执行，个别县还有单打一的缺点。对工作也还缺乏认真负责的精神，违犯征收原则、以及在执行货物税开发票证中，丢票、丢款、挪借短差等现象，半年来据不完全统计共有二十四、五次之多。
    有的县在工作中，个别干部缺乏民主作风，不宣传解释政策而是强迫命令，有的县还发生过扣人事件。
    以上这些缺点和错误，曾使工作受到一些损失。今后如何加强领导，提高一般干部的政策业务水平，把工作推进一步，是一个主要的问题。
