Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd dispatch: According to a New York broadcast on the 19th, the United Nations Secretariat received MacArthur's report to the Security Council on the Korean situation. MacArthur complained that United Nations member states were not "active enough in supporting the police action in Korea." He said that while there was some foreign troop "cooperation" in the navy and air force, the entire burden of the war fell on the shoulders of the American army on the ground.

MacArthur, at the end of his report, arrogantly demanded that all countries immediately dispatch ground troops to Korea, and that they be drawn from existing forces, and not delayed by the "time needed to train new units."

Xinhua News Agency, August 22nd dispatch: Under the frequent urging and strong pressure from the American authorities, the British and Australian governments have agreed to immediately send a small force to Korea to further participate in the American war of aggression to slaughter the Korean people. According to Reuters Singapore dispatch: The British Army Far East Command in Singapore announced on the evening of the 20th: "In response to the request for reinforcements urgently requested by the commander of the 'United Nations Forces' in Korea, the United Kingdom government has decided to immediately send an infantry unit from Hong Kong to Korea." According to Reuters Canberra dispatch: The British troops transferred from Hong Kong to Korea will consist of two battalions. The agency also stated: Australian Acting Prime Minister Fadden announced on the 21st that Australia will send a battalion of ground troops to Korea along with the British troops departing from Hong Kong.

According to an AFP dispatch from Lake Success: UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie received a notice from British Foreign Secretary Bevin on the 21st regarding the immediate dispatch of troops, in which Bevin specifically mentioned: "Britain made this decision after MacArthur's recent urgent appeal to all countries to supply manpower to the United Nations forces in Korea." AFP also said: "The use of these British troops will become a problem for MacArthur because their weapons and ammunition are different from American standards."

　　麦克阿瑟感到情势危急
    催促附庸国家立即供给炮灰
    英澳宣布即派小量部队赴朝
    【新华社二十二日讯】据纽约十九日广播：联合国秘书处接到麦克阿瑟致安理会的朝鲜局势报告。麦克阿瑟埋怨说：联合国会员国“支持在朝鲜警察行动的积极性不够”，如果说在海军和空军方面有若干外国军队的“联合”，在陆地则全付战争担子都落在美国军队的肩上。
    麦克阿瑟在其报告的结尾蛮横地要求各国立即派遣陆军赴朝鲜，并且要从现有部队中抽调，而勿以“编训新队伍需要时间，拖延部队的派遣”。
    【新华社二十二日讯】在美国当局的频频催促与强大的压力之下，英国与澳大利亚政府已答应立即派一支小部队赴朝鲜，进一步参加美国屠杀朝鲜人民的侵略战争。据路透社新加坡讯：新加坡英国陆军远东司令部二十日晚宣布：“为了响应在朝鲜的‘联合国部队’总司令所提出的速派援军的请求，联合王国政府已决定立即自香港派一支步兵赴朝鲜”。据路透社堪培拉讯：由香港调赴朝鲜的英军将为两个营。该社又称：澳代总理费登二十一日宣布：澳将派一营陆军与自香港出发的英军同赴朝鲜。
    另据法新社成功湖电称：联合国秘书长赖伊于二十一日接获英外相贝文关于立即派兵的通知，其中贝文特别提到：“英国是在麦克阿瑟最近紧急呼吁各国以人力供应在朝鲜的联合国部队后，作此决定的。”法新社又称：“使用这批英军，对于麦克阿瑟将成为一个问题，因其武器弹药都不同于美国标准。”
