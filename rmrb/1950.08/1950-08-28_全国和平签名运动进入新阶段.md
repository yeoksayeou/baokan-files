　　National Peace Signature Campaign Enters New Stage
　　Zhuang Puming
    The China Peace Committee issued a call to the people of the whole country on August 13 to continue expanding the peace signature campaign, which immediately received a warm response and unanimous support from the broad masses of the people throughout the country. From small and medium-sized cities to the vast countryside, from organized masses to unorganized masses, from the grasslands of Inner Mongolia to Hainan Island in the southernmost part of the motherland, from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to remote Xinjiang, a vigorous upsurge of peace signatures has unfolded. According to incomplete statistics, as of August 25, the number of peace signatures nationwide has reached 78,628,890, an increase of 19,342,711 compared to the 59,286,179 people counted when China Peace issued this call; that is, in the last twelve days, the number of peace signatures nationwide has increased by more than 32 percent of the total number of signatures in the previous three months.
    During this period, the call of China Peace was first responded to by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the New Democratic Youth League of China, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. These people's organizations jointly issued a notice requiring their respective organizations at all levels to regard the task of promoting the peace signature campaign as one of their most important current tasks. Cai Chang, Vice Chairman of China Peace and Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, also gave a radio speech on the evening of the 16th, calling on the people of the whole country to continue to deepen and expand the peace signature campaign.
    In the East China region, the East China Branch of China Peace is preparing to establish itself in order to uniformly lead the peace movement in the provinces of East China and the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, and strive to complete the task of 55 million signatures in the entire region by the end of September. The Hubei Provincial Branch of China Peace is now printing enough peace declarations and a large number of publicity materials for 7 million signatures, and is working hard to complete the task of 7 million signatures in the province. People's organizations in Hebei Province held a joint meeting on August 15 to make specific arrangements for expanding the peace signature campaign in the province. Fifteen kinds of publicity materials are now being printed in large quantities, which will be distributed to cadres in various places for study and publicity; and a publicity inspection team is being jointly organized, ready to go to various places to publicize and further promote the in-depth development of the signature campaign. Local newspapers have published editorials responding to the call of China Peace. In addition to the People's Daily and Guangming Daily in Beijing, Shanghai's Liberation Daily, Ta Kung Pao, News Daily, and Chongqing's Xinhua Daily have also published articles calling on people from all walks of life to continue to expand the signature campaign. In Henan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and West Sichuan, efforts are now being made to promote the peace signature campaign to the vast rural areas.
    The peace signature campaign in various places has now entered a new stage. In some large and medium-sized cities, almost all adults, youths, and teenagers have signed their names. For example, the number of signatures in Wuhan, Chengdu, Wuzhou, and Changzhou exceeds 90 percent of the city's population; the number of signatures in Shanghai, Chongqing, Qingdao, and Jilin also exceeds 80 percent of the city's population. In rural areas, the signature campaign has been developed extensively and deeply. Among the more than 700,000 people who signed in the three administrative regions of Kashgar, Shache, and Hotan in Xinjiang, the vast majority are farmers. In Zhu Yu District of Zhouzhi, Shaanxi, more than 13,000 farmers signed their names in three days, reaching 76 percent of the total population of the district. According to statistics from Nanzheng City and nine counties in the Xianyang District of the province, 160,000 rural women have signed their names. The West Sichuan Administrative Region recently collected 1 million signatures in rural areas. Farmers in Yanliuzhuang, Wuyang County, Henan, collectively signed their names after swearing an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait.
    People of all ethnic groups and religious beliefs throughout the country have enthusiastically and unanimously signed the peace declaration. The number of signatures in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has reached 432,000, accounting for 19.2 percent of the region's population. Among the more than 1.2 million signatories in Xinjiang Province, the Uygur and Kazakh people account for more than 70 percent. Many religious groups in various places have mobilized believers and people from all walks of life to sign. According to extremely incomplete statistics, 9,255 Buddhists across the country have signed their names. The peace signature campaign has also unfolded in the most remote areas. In Manzhouli in the northernmost part of the motherland, Hainan Island in the southernmost part, and Yining in the westernmost part, it is proceeding with burning enthusiasm.
    The current upsurge of the peace signature campaign in various parts of the country fully demonstrates the Chinese people's determination to actively fight against wars of aggression and defend world peace. Judging from these enthusiastic situations, as long as the people of the whole country continue to work hard to expand the peace signature campaign to the vast rural areas and strive for 200 million signatures on the peace declaration throughout the country, it is entirely possible to do so.

　　全国和平签名运动进入新阶段
    庄浦明
    中国保卫世界和平大会委员会于八月十三日向全国人民发出了继续扩大和平签名运动的号召，立即得到全国广大人民的热烈响应与一致拥护。从中小城市到广大农村，从有组织群众到无组织群众，从内蒙古的草原到祖国最南的海南岛，从扬子江的下游到遥远的新疆，如火如荼地展开了和平签名的热潮。据不完全的统计，截至八月二十五日止，全国和平签名人数已达七千八百六十二万八千八百九十人，较中国和大发出这次号召时统计的人数五千九百二十八万六千一百七十九人，增加了一千九百三十四万二千七百十一人；也即在最近十二天内，全国和平签名人数增加了以前三个多月来签名总数的百分之三十二强。
    在这期间，中国和大的号召首先得到中华全国总工会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中国新民主主义青年团、中华全国民主妇女联合会等团体的响应。各该人民团体曾经联合发出通知，要求所属各级组织把推进和平签名运动的任务当作自己目前最重要的工作之一。中国和大副主席、全国妇联主席蔡畅，并于十六日晚作了广播讲演，号召全国人民继续深入展开和平签名运动。
    在华东区，中国和大华东区分会，正在筹备成立，以便统一领导华东各省及上海、南京两市的保卫世界和平运动，争取于九月底完成全区五千五百万人签名的任务。中国和大湖北省分会现正印制足够七百万人签名的和平宣言和大批宣传资料，努力争取完成全省有七百万人签名的任务。河北省各人民团体于八月十五日召开了联席会议，作出扩大全省和平签名运动的具体布置。现正大量印制十五种宣传资料。将发给各地干部作学习和宣传之用；并正在联合组织宣传检查团，准备分赴各地宣传，更进一步推动签名运动的深入发展。各地报纸都发表社论响应中国和大的号召，除北京人民日报、光明日报外，上海解放日报、大公报、新闻日报及重庆新华日报等，均著论号召各界人民继续扩大签名运动。在河南、广东、广西、陕西、新疆、川西等地，现正把和平签名运动努力推向广大农村发展。
    目前各地的和平签名运动已进入了新阶段。在若干大中城市中，几乎所有的成年人和青年及少年都已签了名，如武汉、成都、梧州、常州等市的签名人数都占全市人口百分之九十以上；上海、重庆、青岛、吉林等市的签名人数也已占全市人口的百分之八十以上。在农村中，签名运动已得到普遍深入的发展。新疆喀什、莎车、和阗三个行政区签名的七十余万人，其中绝大多数为农民。陕西周至竹峪区在三天内即有一万三千余农民签名，达全区人口总数的百分之七十六。据该省南郑市和咸阳分区九个县的统计，仅农村劳动妇女签名的即已有十六万人。川西行政区最近在农村中征集了一百万人签名。河南舞阳县阎刘庄的农民在毛主席像前宣誓后集体签名。
    全国人民不分民族和宗教信仰，都热烈地一致在和平宣言上签名。内蒙古自治区的签名人数已达四十三万二千人，占全区人口的百分之十九点二。新疆省一百二十余万人的签名者中，维吾尔族人民和哈萨克族人民占了百分之七十以上。各地许多宗教团体都发动了教徒和各界人民签名。据极不完全的统计，全国各地佛教徒已有九千二百五十五人签名。和平签名运动也在最边远的地区展开。在祖国最北的满洲里，最南的海南岛，以及最西的伊宁，都在炽火般热烈进行着。
    目前全国各地和平签名运动的热潮，充分表现了中国人民为反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平而积极奋斗决心。从这些热烈情况看来，只要全国人民继续努力，把和平签名运动扩展到广大农村中去，争取全国范围内两万万人在和平宣言上签名，是完全可以办到的。
