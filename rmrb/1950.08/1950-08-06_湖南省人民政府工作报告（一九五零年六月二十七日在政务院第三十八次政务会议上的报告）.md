Work Report of the People's Government of Hunan Province
(Report at the 38th Political Affairs Meeting of the Government Administration Council on June 27, 1950)
Wang Shoudao, Chairman of the People's Government of Hunan Province

Premier, Deputy Premiers, and members of the Council:

It will be almost eleven months since the peaceful liberation of Changsha, Hunan Province, on August 4th last year. The first eight months, before March, were the period of the Provisional Provincial Government. The main tasks during this period were to militarily eliminate the remaining enemies, liberate the entire province of Hunan, suppress bandits, reorganize miscellaneous armed forces, restore traffic order, steadily take over cities and open up rural areas, and at the same time carry out grain requisitioning and support the front, and initially launch the mass movements of rent reduction and anti-despotism. At that time, we were in an exceptionally complex environment with exceptionally arduous tasks. All cadres deeply felt the importance and difficulty of their work responsibilities. However, relying on the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the higher-level military and political leading organs, and the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people, we smoothly completed the liberation of 28 million people, two provincial-level cities, and seventy-seven counties in the entire province according to the planned schedule. We also successfully completed various tasks during the military takeover period. (A written report on the work during this period has been submitted previously.)

Now, I will mainly report on several major issues in the nearly three months since the establishment of the Provincial People's Government on April 1st, including production and disaster relief, financial and economic work, transformation of rural political power, and preparation for land reform:

(1) On Production and Disaster Relief Work

The spring plowing and rice transplanting in the whole province were completed in early June, and the spring famine has been overcome. Currently, we are stepping up summer cultivation and overcoming the summer famine. This year, we plan to increase rice production by 1 billion catties. Judging from the current positive production enthusiasm of the farmers and various specific tasks, it is hoped that the plan will be completed and exceeded if there are no special major floods. The key links in our work are:

First, to harness water conservancy, combine it with disaster relief, and fight against floods. Due to years of harassment by soldiers and bandits and the major floods of the past two years, the disaster-stricken area in the counties along the lake reached more than 4 million mu last year alone, and more than 1.2 million disaster victims were unable to resume production. Other non-severely affected areas also faced serious spring famine difficulties. We believe that in order to overcome the spring famine and carry out spring plowing, we should actively harness water conservancy, restore polder fields, provide work as a form of relief, and help disaster victims; combine disaster relief with spring plowing, and balance overcoming the famine with preventing famine, to ensure that crops can be planted and that there will be a good harvest this year, which will fundamentally solve the problem of disaster and famine. Therefore, before the spring plowing, in the counties along the lake, the masses were vigorously led to repair dikes and polders using the method of public-private partnership. The masses used 50.6 million catties of rice as payment for labor, and the government loaned 37 million catties of rice (excluding Datong Lake), repairing more than 3.9 million mu of polder fields. More than 500,000 people were provided with work as a form of relief to overcome the spring famine (with even greater political gains). In mountainous areas, efforts were focused on repairing and building new ponds and dams. A total of more than 64,000 were built in 26 counties including Pingjiang and Liuyang, and more than 12,000 waterwheels were repaired, thereby turning many dry fields into paddy fields. However, the quality of the entire repair project was poor due to late start and poor inspection, and individual dikes and polders have already collapsed. Therefore, inspections and repairs were carried out in conjunction with spring plowing. Currently, it is the summer flood season, and we are actively carrying out flood prevention, collapse prevention, and emergency rescue work, striving to ensure that the majority of dikes and polders do not collapse.

Second, to specifically solve the difficulties of the masses, implement the policy of production for self-salvation, social mutual assistance, and government support. Last year, basic areas carried out winter production campaigns and organized various sideline productions, laying a preliminary foundation for this spring's production and overcoming the famine. Before the spring plowing, in the province-wide rent reduction and deposit refund movement, farmers obtained more than 400 million catties of grain, and their living and production materials were partially resolved; this spring, the government's transportation expenses for the transfer of surplus grain were more than 71 million catties of rice, which at least solved the food problem for more than 2.3 million people for one month. The government issued a total of more than 71 million catties of rice for production and disaster relief loans and relief grain. In addition, there were various agricultural loans and special product loans, which played a great role in helping the masses in production and disaster relief. The people in the vast disaster areas unanimously thanked Chairman Mao and the People's Government. According to the old habits of the masses, methods such as voluntary exchange of labor, borrowing cattle, or exchanging human labor for cattle labor were used to solve the difficulty of lacking cattle. In some rural areas, free lending has been restored. All of the above made it possible to solve the difficulties of food, seeds, and cattle encountered in the spring plowing. However, there were shortcomings and deviations in the deposit refund work in some places. In the fifth district of Shaoyang, etc., due to the self-flow of leadership and neglect of production for self-salvation, the disaster situation developed and the difficulties increased. In some places, phenomena such as average distribution and delayed time occurred in the issuance of loan grain. These situations were improved after inspection, and all have improved.

Third, to publicize the policy of developing production, stabilize the production sentiment of all strata, and fight against the rumors and sabotage of bandits, secret agents, and lawless landlords. Before and after the start of spring plowing, reactionary elements took advantage of the spring famine to disrupt social order, sabotage production, and endanger the People's Government. Many of our new and old cadres suffered losses as a result. They spread rumors saying: "After fighting the landlords, fight the rich peasants, after fighting the rich peasants, fight the middle peasants," "divide the green seedlings," "the more you produce, the more you bear," and so on. This caused considerable concerns among the people of all strata. Some dared not produce boldly, and some did not apply fertilizer or cultivate carefully, causing new difficulties for spring plowing. After the propaganda campaign of the ten major policies for spring plowing and production and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's policy of preserving the rich peasant economy, the production sentiment of the people of all strata turned to stability. The peasants showed active production, with most plowing two or three times, and transplanting was generally completed five to seven days earlier than in the past, with basically no wasteland. However, the implementation of the policy is not yet deep enough. In individual places, there are still things that infringe on the interests of middle peasants in spring plowing, and the correction is not timely or resolute, causing some of the masses to have doubts and wait and see, saying, "The policy is good, but I don't know what will happen in the future?" Some cadres do not understand the policy well enough, and the propaganda and explanation are not enough. Lawless landlords deliberately distort the policy in an attempt to counterattack the masses. Therefore, it is very important to continue to deeply implement the policy, further improve the production enthusiasm of all strata, overcome the skeptical attitude of some of the masses and cadres towards the policy, resolutely correct the infringement of the interests of middle peasants, and smash the sabotage activities and counterattack conspiracies of lawless landlords and other reactionary elements. Propaganda of policy, stabilization of production sentiment, anti-rumors, and anti-sabotage must continue to be implemented in this year's production work.

Fourth, to constantly educate cadres, understand the situation, start from reality, strengthen leadership in production, and specifically organize inspections. In mid-April, we shifted our focus to spring plowing and production, making it the overriding central task, and overcoming the idea of some cadres that they belittled leading production and thought that leading production was easier than leading mass movements. From the province to the county, leading comrades personally went to the disaster areas for inspection. The provincial government had Vice Chairmen Yuan, Cheng, and Tan lead working groups to inspect the disaster areas along the lake to promote spring plowing and disaster relief work; so that loan grain was generally quickly distributed to farmers, organizing production, overcoming difficulties, and ensuring that there was no wasteland in the disaster areas. In organizational leadership, the commissioners, county heads, and district heads, in addition to taking care of the overall spring plowing production, relied on connecting with one township, specifically understanding the situation, creating experience, and guiding the overall situation. Full use was made of the peasant representative meetings and all-circles people's representative meetings to publicize and mobilize the masses to carry out spring plowing and disaster relief. During the production season, the peasant associations focused on leading production, and led production according to local conditions. Comrades from the north were not familiar with farming in the south, and some committed mistakes of empiricism and commandism. Such as ordering the masses to collectively reclaim wasteland, register, and forcibly organize work exchange teams, etc., the masses said: "It won't work," complaining that "work exchange is counterproductive." The new cadres, who accounted for 70-80% of the total number of cadres, generally had the idea that the masses would produce, and as long as there was food, they could produce without leadership. Therefore, it is very important to educate and improve cadres, establish a mass viewpoint for leading production, start from reality, ask old farmers if they do not understand farming, and take the mass line to lead production.

The experience of spring plowing and disaster relief proves that the areas where the leadership is timely, the policies are implemented, the forces are specifically organized, the inspections are thorough, and the difficulties are solved, the work achievements are great, otherwise, the problems will occur more. This shows that the leadership issue is the key to determining the success or failure of the work.

There are still many problems in production and disaster relief work: First, some of the cultivation is still rough, especially in the disaster areas along the lake. Due to the lack of cattle and the difficulty of plowing, many are planted directly, and some are transplanted after only rolling it once. Second, the fertilizer is insufficient (especially lime fertilizer). Due to insufficient preparation in advance, although efforts were made to step up production, the time was tight, and the output could not meet the demand. The general area used 20% less fertilizer than in the past, and the disaster area used half less, only a few areas exceeded the past. Third, although the spring famine has been overcome, new disasters have occurred in various places. It is estimated that the severely affected areas along the lake are still short of some food, and the famine has occurred in many places in the lightly affected areas and non-disaster areas; mountain floods have washed away ponds and dams, paddy fields have been submerged, local products have been unsalable, sideline production has been reduced, and there have been insect pests and banditry in some areas. Fourth, cadres and the masses have the idea of taking a breath after overcoming the spring famine and completing the transplanting, ignoring the long-term and continuous nature of production and disaster relief work. At present, we must overcome the idea of taking a breath, step up summer cultivation, overcome the summer famine, and lead the masses to weed and fertilize, and do one more trampling to make up for the rough spring plowing. In order to strengthen production and disaster relief work, on June 8th, the provincial government sent eight working groups and 186 cadres to the countryside to urge various special and county governments to use the existing 302 million catties of public grain to purchase local products and sell grain at a large discount; issue loans for various flood control, drought control, collapse prevention, and drainage tools and equipment, and focus on building warehouses, as well as necessary disaster relief loans, so as to organize the masses to produce and help themselves, and overcome the summer famine.

(2) Implementation of National Unified Finance and Economics and Adjustment of Industry and Commerce

Hunan has generally overfulfilled the financial tasks stipulated by the Central Government and the Central and South Military and Political Committee. The public bonds were completed in mid-May, reaching 107% of the original target of 3.5 million shares. The transfer of 350 million catties of rice for public grain to Guangdong, Guangxi, East China, Hankou, and internal transfers within the province was completed earlier than May. In terms of taxation, 80% of the summer tasks have been completed in April and May. In terms of finance and trade, the deposit balance at the end of April exceeded the task by 85%; we have also preliminarily completed the plan for reorganizing and saving financial expenditures according to the decisions of the Central and South Military and Political Committee.

Due to the implementation of the national unified finance and economics decisions, financial expenditures have been tightened, currency has been withdrawn, and prices have been stabilized. Prices in Hunan began to stabilize and gradually decline from mid-March. According to statistics from Changsha and other eight towns, the price in mid-April decreased by 46% compared with mid-March. Since then, the people of Hunan have been freed from the long-term suffering of inflation; it has also played a major role in helping disaster victims to produce and overcome the famine. But at the same time, industry and commerce in the province also encountered some difficulties as a result, such as product sales stagnation, production shrinking, business difficult to maintain, and applications for closure. In Changsha in April alone, there were more than 400 applications for closure, causing some workers and shop assistants to suffer unemployment. In the promotion of tax revenue and public bonds, due to the subjective urgency to complete the task, and the small number of cadres and poor understanding of the situation, the phenomenon of tax evasion by merchants still existed, resulting in deviations such as uneven burdens.

In order to overcome these difficulties during the economic transition period, we have carried out the adjustment of industry and commerce and the adjustment of burdens according to the instructions of the Central Government and the Central and South Military and Political Committee, based on the specific conditions of the province. In the adjustment of industry and commerce, the main thing is to order goods and purchase finished products from private industry, stipulate product standards suitable for market requirements, and help them improve production management, improve product quality, and reduce costs. Secondly, rationally adjust prices, so that the price of origin and the price of sales, retail and wholesale prices have a reasonable difference, and implement the principle of taking into account the interests of producers, transporters, and consumers. Third, appropriately reduce and stop continuing to open state-owned retail stores and consignment stores, and retail goods are also limited to the main necessities such as grain, salt, coal, cloth, and kerosene. The business of specialized companies focuses on procurement and wholesale, organizes trade groups, goes deep into rural towns, absorbs local products, promotes the RMB to the countryside, and encourages private merchants to go to the countryside. Finally, strengthen the guidance of local industrial and commercial bureaus or industrial and commercial sections for private merchants to change their business direction, strictly ban obstacles to material exchanges between urban and rural areas, and abolish unreasonable inspection systems and cumbersome procedures for urban and rural trade. In addition, necessary loans, consignment sales, consignment purchases, processing, etc. are implemented according to the overall plan.

In adjusting the burden, the first phase of public bonds has been stopped in May after completing the tasks assigned by higher authorities. In-depth investigation of industrial and commercial tax rules, if it is true that the tax burden exceeds the burden rate, the tax burden is too heavy, which affects business, and the provincial tax bureau approves the implementation of reduction or exemption, or offset the summer industrial and commercial tax. Appropriately handle late payment penalties, only those who conceal and intentionally delay resistance to non-payment are subject to recovery and light penalties for a certain amount of late payment fees.

After the above adjustment measures, although the time is not long, we have begun to see the effect. At present, Hunan's private industry and commerce has begun to improve. The transaction volume in Changsha, Hengyang and other places has increased, closures have decreased, and openings have increased. Industrial and commercial households in Changsha who originally applied for closure have actually continued to operate, and now more than 250 have declared the cancellation of the closure application. The opening funds in May exceeded the closure funds by 44.4%. Other cities also have a trend towards normal improvement. In particular, the hot sales of local products such as tung oil, tea, and hemp are beneficial to the people.

(3) Transformation of Rural Political Power and Preparation for Land Reform

Regarding the issue of rural political power, in the early days of liberation, due to the heavy and urgent task of raising food and supporting the front, the method of using old Baojia personnel was temporarily adopted, which was necessary and correct at that time. With the deepening of our work, especially in the rent reduction movement, the masses have been initially mobilized. According to incomplete statistics in late May, peasant associations have been established in 9,564 of the 14,830 villages in the province, with 5.73 million members, accounting for more than 20% of the province's population. The Provincial Peasant Representative Conference was convened earlier this month, and the Provincial Peasant Association was established. The vast majority of the members of the Peasant Association are positive activists who have been discovered in the rent reduction and anti-despotism movement and production to overcome famine, who have worked for a long time, have a correct style, and have a clean history, except for a few areas where some members are still impure and need to be transformed. They can represent the interests of the broad masses of peasants and implement the government's land reform policy with continued strengthening of education and improvement of awareness. The extensive establishment of peasant associations has laid a solid foundation for establishing a new revolutionary order in rural areas and transforming rural political power. Most counties and cities in the province have also convened all-circles people's representative conferences. We are preparing to further expand the democratic united front work on the basis of the establishment of representative conferences at all levels, and are now preparing to convene the Provincial All-Circles People's Representative Conference in August. With the mobilization of the peasant masses and the establishment of the peasant associations, the broad masses of peasants have generally expressed their demands for democracy and dissatisfaction with the old Baojia. Therefore, the abolition of the old Baojia and the establishment of rural people's political power is an urgent task.

The progress and situation of work in various regions of Hunan are different. In the early days of liberation, there were nearly 200,000 troops of miscellaneous bandits and special agents in the province. Some were reorganized and disintegrated, and nearly 100,000 bandits were annihilated by the main force. There are still more than 13,000 bandits in stock, and it is planned to eliminate them in a short period of time. The provincial government has decided to carry out the transformation of rural political power step by step in June, July, and August according to the different situations in different regions. The method of electing the Township People's Government Committee by the peasant representative conference acting on behalf of the People's Representative Conference is temporarily adopted. The township is determined as the basic-level political power, and elections are carried out in units of township. No level is established below the township. A representative director is elected by peasant representatives from one or two natural villages or the scope of the former Jia, or the representative director is elected by the peasant association group. The peasant association group acts as a voter group, serving as a link and a link between the township people's government and representatives and the masses. The Township People's Government has a committee and a township head. The committee has 9 to 15 members according to the population, and the committee has finance and grain, production, and culture and education committees. In order to establish a democratic system and avoid bad elements usurping the election, the following methods are adopted: First, peasant representatives and members of the Township People's Government are elected every six months; second, the peasant representative conference can exercise the power of removal over government members; third, after the government members are elected, they must be approved and appointed by the higher-level government, and can be ordered to be removed when necessary.

The entire province of Hunan is preparing to complete land reform within two years. This year, it is preparing to implement land reform in some basic areas. The Central People's Government is about to promulgate a complete land reform law suitable for the new situation, and land reform will inevitably be promoted more smoothly in the future. However, to do a good job in land reform, there must be strong leadership and the widespread mobilization and organization of the peasant masses. The Hunan Provincial Government has now established a Land Reform Committee and has begun to train land reform work cadres, and is systematically carrying out the rectification of cadres' work style. This will play a decisive role in the smooth progress of land reform work.

Land reform is a serious mass struggle. In some areas of Hunan, the hidden Kuomintang reactionary remnants collude with evil tyrants and lawless landlords to organize reactionary activities such as the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army" and the "Property Protection Party"; they use all methods to sabotage the peasant movement, resist land reform, collude with bandit and special agent armed forces to carry out harassment and sabotage, or buy over and use individual bad elements to drill into the peasant association to carry out instigation and conspiracy to sabotage activities. Therefore, we believe that the basic problem of transforming rural political power and preparing for land reform is to organize the peasant ranks and do a good job in the work of the rural peasant representative conference and peasant association. Otherwise, the great and arduous task of land reform cannot be completed.

　　湖南省人民政府工作报告
    （一九五零年六月二十七日在政务院第三十八次政务会议上的报告）
    湖南省人民政府主席  王首道总理、副总理、各位委员：
    湖南省自去年八月四日长沙和平解放到现在将满十一个月，三月以前的八个月是临时省政府时期。这一时期主要工作是军事上扫清残敌，解放湖南全省，清剿土匪，收编游杂武装，恢复交通秩序，稳步地进行接管城市和开辟乡村工作，同时进行征粮支前和初步发动减租、反霸群众运动等工作。当时我们是处在环境异常复杂，任务异常繁重的情况中。全体干部都深深感觉着工作责任的重大和艰巨。但是我们依靠了毛主席和上级军政领导机关的正确领导和广大人民的热忱拥护，使我们按照预定计划顺利地完成了解放全省二千八百万人口，两个省辖市，七十七个县，并顺利地完成了军事接管时期的各项工作任务。（这一时期工作以前作过书面报告。）
    现在我主要地是将四月一日省人民政府成立以来，将近三个月中关于生产救灾、财经工作、改造乡村政权与准备土地改革等几个主要问题报告如下：
  （一）关于生产与救灾工作
    全省春耕插秧，六月初即已完成，春荒业已度过。目前正在加紧夏耘和度过夏荒。我们今年计划增产稻谷十万万斤，依照现在农民积极的生产情绪和各项具体工作看来，如果没有特殊的大水灾是有希望完成和超过计划的。我们进行工作几个重要的环节是：
    第一，兴修水利，结合救灾，向水患做斗争。由于长年兵匪骚扰，两年来的大水灾，滨湖各县只去年受灾面积即达四百余万亩，一百二十余万灾民无法恢复生产，其他的非重灾区也面临着严重的春荒困难。我们认为要想度过春荒，进行春耕，应积极兴修水利，恢复垸田，以工代赈，救济灾民；把救灾与春耕结合，度荒与防荒兼顾，保证农田作物能种上，今年有一个好收成，才会根本地解决灾荒问题。因此，春耕前在滨湖各县，以民办公助的办法，大力领导群众修复堤垸。群众以工抵费五千零六十万斤米，政府贷粮三千七百万斤米（大通湖不在内），修复垸田三百九十余万亩，以工代赈，度过春荒的群众在五十万人以上（政治收获更大）。在山乡地带，则抓紧修复和新建塘坝，平江、浏阳等二十六县计共修建六万四千多处，整修水车一万二千多架，从而使不少旱田变为水田。但是整个修复工程，因动手迟，检查差，工程质量不好，个别堤垸已发生溃倒情事。所以又结合春耕进行了检查与修补。目前正值夏汛时期，正在积极进行防汛防溃和抢险工作，争取保证多数堤垸不致溃决。
    第二，具体解决群众的困难，贯彻生产自救，社会互助，加以政府扶助的方针。去年基本地区进行了冬季生产运动并组织进行了各种各样的副业生产，给今春生产度荒打下了初步基础。春耕前全省规模的减租退押运动，农民获得粮谷四亿余斤，生活及生产资料得到部分的解决；今春余粮外调，政府运费支出七千一百余万斤大米，至少解决二百三十万以上人口一个月的口粮。政府发放生产救灾贷粮，救济粮等总计大米七千一百余万斤。此外尚有各种农业贷款与特产贷款等，对于扶助群众生产救灾起了很大的作用。广大灾区人民众口同声感谢毛主席和人民政府。根据群众旧有习惯，采用自愿换工，借牛或人工换牛工等办法，解决缺乏耕牛的困难，农村部分地区已恢复自由借贷。由上种种，使春耕遇到的口粮、籽种、耕牛等困难得以解决。但有些地方，退押工作中是有缺点和偏差的。邵阳五区等，由于领导自流，忽视生产自救，致使灾情发展，困难增多。有些地方发放贷粮，发生平均分配及拖延时间等现象。这些情况经检查后，加以改进，均有好转。
    第三，宣传发展生产政策，稳定各阶层生产情绪，向土匪、特务、不法地主的造谣破坏作斗争。春耕开始前后，反动分子利用春荒，捣乱社会秩序，破坏生产，危害人民政府，我新老干部因之受损失不少。他们造谣说：“斗了地主斗富农、斗了富农斗中农”，“分青苗”，“多生产多负担”等等。给各阶层人民不少顾虑，有的不敢大胆生产，有的不施肥，不细作，致使春耕遭到新的困难。经过春耕生产十大政策和中共中央保存富农经济政策的宣传运动，各阶层人民生产情绪才转为稳定。农民生产表现积极，耕作多数为两犁两耙到三犁三耙，插秧一般比过去提早五天到七天完成，基本上没有荒地。可是政策贯彻的还不够深入。个别地方在春耕中还有侵犯中农利益的事情并纠正得不及时不坚决，部分群众产生疑惑观望，“政策是好，将来不知怎样？”有些干部对政策领会不够，宣传解释不够，不法地主故意曲解政策，企图向群众反攻。因此，继续深入的贯彻政策，进一步提高各阶层的生产积极性，克服部分群众与干部对政策的怀疑态度，切实纠正侵犯中农利益，并粉碎不法地主以及其他反动分子的破坏活动与阴谋反攻，是十分重要的事情。宣传政策，稳定生产情绪，反谣言，反破坏，在今年生产工作中要继续贯彻下去。
    第四，不断的教育干部，了解情况，从实际出发，加强领导生产，具体组织检查。四月中旬，我们把中心转入春耕生产，作为压倒一切的中心工作，克服了某些干部的轻视领导生产及领导生产比领导群众运动较为轻松的思想。从省到县，领导同志亲到灾区检查，省府曾有袁、程、谭三位副主席率领工作团到滨湖灾区巡视，推动春耕救灾工作；使贷粮一般的迅速发到农民手中，组织生产，克服困难，做到灾区没有荒田。在组织领导上，专员、县长、区长除照顾全面春耕生产外，依托联系一个乡，具体了解情况，创造经验，指导全面。充分运用农民代表会及各界人民代表会，宣传与发动群众进行春耕救灾。农会在生产季节，以领导生产为中心，因地制宜，领导生产。北方来的同志，对南方农事不熟悉，有的犯了经验主义、命令主义的毛病。如命令群众集体开荒，造册登记，强编变工队等，群众则说：“行不通”，埋怨“变工反而误工”。占干部数量百分之七、八十的新干部，普遍存在着群众会生产，只要有口粮，不领导也能生产的思想。所以教育提高干部，建立领导生产的群众观点，从实际出发，不懂农事问老农，走群众路线来领导生产是很重要的。
    春耕救灾经验证明，凡是领导及时，贯彻政策，具体组织力量，深入检查，解决困难的地区，工作成绩就大，否则问题发生就多，这就说明了领导问题是决定工作好坏的关键。
    生产救灾工作中，仍存在着不少问题：第一、耕作有的还粗糙，尤其是滨湖受灾区，因耕牛缺乏，犁耙困难，不少是点种的，有的也是只滚一下就插秧。第二、肥料不足（尤其是石灰肥料），因事先准备不足，虽曾加紧制造，但时间紧迫，产不应需，一般地区比过去少上肥百分之二十，灾区少上一半，只个别地区超过过去。第三、春荒虽已度过，各地又发生了新的灾情，滨湖重灾区估计尚差一部分口粮，轻灾区和非灾区不少地方已发生了灾荒；山洪冲毁塘坝，稻田淹没，土产滞销，副业减产，以及部分地区虫害匪患等等。第四、干部和群众在度过春荒完成插秧以后，存在着松一口气的思想，忽视生产救灾工作的长期性与持续性。目前必须克服松一口气的思想，加紧夏耘，战胜夏荒，领导群众耘田施肥，多除草多加肥多踩一道，以补春耕粗糙。为加强生产救灾工作，六月八日省府派出八个工作组、百八十六个干部下乡，督促各专、县利用现存公粮三亿零二百万斤，进行收购土产，大量平粜；发放防洪防旱防溃排渍各种工具设备的贷款，并重点建仓，以及必要的赈贷，这样来组织群众生产自救，度过夏荒。
  （二）执行全国财经统一和调整工商业问题
    湖南对于中央和中南军政委员会所规定的财政任务，一般都已超额完成。公债于五月中即完成原定三百五十万分的百分之一百零七。调运两广、华东、汉口和本省调剂的公粮三亿五千万斤大米，早于五月份完成。在税收上四、五两月已完成夏季任务的百分之八十。在金融贸易方面，四月底存款余额超过任务百分之八十五；关于整编与节省财政开支等等，我们也照中南军政委员会的决定初步完成计划。
    由于执行了全国财经统一决定，达到了财政开支紧缩，货币回笼，物价稳定。湖南物价自三月中旬开始稳定并逐步下降。据长沙等八城镇统计，四月中旬较三月中旬下降了百分之四十六。从此，使湖南人民摆脱了长期通货膨胀痛苦；对于灾民生产度荒，也起了重大作用。但同时全省工商业也因此遇到了一些困难，如产品滞销，生产萎缩，营业难于维持，申请歇业，长沙市四月份申请歇业者就有四百多家，使部分工人、店员遭受失业。在税收公债推销上，亦因主观上急于完成任务，又因干部少，掌握情况差，商人逃税现象仍然存在，致发生畸轻畸重等等偏差。
    为了克服经济转变时期的这些困难，我们依照中央与中南军政委员会的指示，根据本省具体情况，进行了调整工商业与调整负担的工作。在调整工商业方面，主要的是向私营工业订货和收购成品，规定适合市场要求的产品标准，帮助其改善生产管理，提高产品质量，降低成本。其次，合理调整价格，使出产地价格与销售地价格，零售与批发价格有合理的差额，贯彻对生产者、贩运者和消费者三方面兼顾的原则。第三，适当减少与停止继续开设国营零售门市部与代销店，零售物品也限于粮、盐、煤、布、煤油等主要必需品。使专业公司业务着重收购与批发，组织贸易小组，深入乡村市镇，吸收土产，推行人民币下乡并鼓励私商下乡。最后，加强各地工商局或工商科指导私商转变业务经营方针，严格取缔城乡物资交流的障碍，取消城乡贸易的不合理检查制度与烦琐手续。此外，还依照整个计划实行必要的贷款及代销、代购、加工等等方法。
    在调整负担上，第一期公债在完成上级任务的基础上，五月即已停止继续推销。对工商税则深入调查，确因超过负担率，纳税过重因而影响营业者，经省税局批准实行减免，或抵交夏季工商业税。适当处理滞纳处罚，只对隐瞒与有意拖延抵抗不纳者，才实行追缴与从轻处罚一定滞纳金。
    经以上调整措施，虽时间不久，但已经开始看到效果。目前湖南私营工商业已开始好转。长沙、衡阳等地交易额有了增加，歇业减少，开业增多。长沙原申请歇业的工商业户，实际上一直继续营业，现在声明撤消歇业申请者达二百五十余家。五月份开业资金较歇业资金超过百分之四十四点四。其他城市，也有走向正常好转的趋势。特别是桐油、茶叶、麻等土产的畅销，对人民是有利的。
  （三）改造乡村政权与准备土地改革问题
    关于乡村政权问题，在解放初期，由于筹粮支前的任务繁重紧迫，暂时采取了使用旧保甲人员的办法，这在当时是需要和正确的。随着我们工作的深入，特别是在减租运动中初步发动了群众，据五月下旬不完全的统计，全省一四、八三○个村中，已有九、五六四个村建立了农民协会，会员达五百七十三万人，占全省人口的百分之二十强。本月初已召集了省农民代表会议，成立了省农民协会。农会委员除某些地区仍有少数成份不纯的要继续改造外，绝大多数是减租反霸运动和生产度荒工作中所发现的长年劳动和作风正派历史清白的积极分子；继续加强教育，提高觉悟，他们是能代表广大农民群众利益和执行政府土地改革政策的。农民协会之广泛建立，为建立农村新的革命秩序和改造乡村政权打下了坚实的基础。全省也有大多数县市召开过了各界人民代表会议。我们准备在各级代表会议建立的基础上，进一步展开民主统一战线工作，现准备于八月内召开全省各界人民代表会议。随着农民群众的发动和农民协会的建立，广大农民群众已经普遍表示了对民主的要求和对旧保甲的不满。所以取销旧保甲，建立乡村人民政权已是迫切的工作。
    湖南各地区工作进展与情况各有差别。解放初期全省约有游杂土匪特务武装近二十万人，改编和溃散了一部分，经主力部队歼灭的土匪将近十万，现尚有股匪一万三千余人，计划于短期间肃清。省府决定根据地区情况的不同分别在六、七、八三个月中有步骤地进行改造乡村政权的工作。暂采用农民代表会代行人民代表会职权选举乡人民政府委员会的办法。确定乡为基层政权，以乡为单位进行选举。乡以下不成立一级，由一个或两个自然村或原甲所辖范围内的农民代表选举一个代表主任，或者由农协小组选出代表主任，以农协小组起选民小组作用，作为乡人民政府与代表及群众间的联系和工作的纽带。乡人民政府设委员会与乡长，委员按人口多少设九人至十五人，委员会下设财粮、生产、文教各委员会。为着建立民主制度，避免坏分子篡窃选举，采取以下办法：第一、农民代表及乡人民政府委员，每半年选举一次；第二、农民代表会议对政府委员可执行罢免权；第三、政府委员选出后，须经上级政府批准、委任，必要时可命令撤换。
    湖南全省准备两年内完成土地改革，今年准备在一部分基本地区实行土地改革。现中央人民政府即将颁发完善的适合于新情况的土地改革法，今后土地改革必然可以更顺利地推行。但要搞好土地改革工作，还必须有坚强的领导和农民群众的广泛发动与组织。现湖南省府已经成立了土地改革委员会，并开始训练土地改革工作干部，有计划地普遍进行整顿干部作风。这对于土地改革工作的顺利进行是有决定的作用的。
    土地改革是一场严重的群众斗争。在湖南有些地区暗藏的国民党反动残余分子，勾结恶霸与不法地主进行组织“反共救国军”与“保产党”等的反动活动；利用一切方法，破坏农民运动，抵抗土地改革，勾结土匪特务武装进行骚扰破坏，或者收买利用个别坏分子钻进农会进行挑拨离间与阴谋破坏活动。因此，我们认为要改造乡村政权与准备土地改革的基本问题，就是要组织农民队伍，把乡村农民代表会议与农民协会的工作做好。否则，伟大而艰巨的土地改革任务是无法完成的。
