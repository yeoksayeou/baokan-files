To the Editor:

I am reporting an embezzlement case to you that occurred at the North China Ordnance Bureau Repair Factory. From July of last year to May of this year, the factory contracted several projects to merchants such as Ni Shilu and three others, with total project costs equivalent to 740,085 *jin* of rice. These projects were overseen by Wang Zhengyu, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the factory, who assigned Zhang Xiuwen, Bai Jinfeng, and Cheng Xianwen to be responsible for valuation and supervision. To secure more contracts, contractor Ni Shilu used various means to entice them, such as inviting them to the theater, meals, gifts, and money. According to the bookkeeper of the contractor, from July to mid-December of last year, there was an expenditure of 40,000 *jin* of rice as a reward (taken by Zhang Xiuwen, the distribution of which has not yet been clarified), which was recorded in the books as being for the purchase of timber. Because of these enticements, the bidding process for all construction projects at the factory from January of this year onward became a mere formality. If they wanted to raise the bid price, they would not widely solicit bids from public and private construction departments; instead, Ni and his associates would secure the contracts by using aliases. The factory did not seriously review the budget, nor did it send anyone to supervise the bidding, simply believing that Wang Zhengyu was capable and that Bai and Cheng were senior employees who would not make mistakes.

When the factory repaired Warehouse No. 1, Ni Shilu contracted the project, reporting 2,750 workdays to the public, at 16.9 *liang* of millet per workday. However, Ni only used 1,500 workdays at 15 *jin* of rice per workday, subcontracting it to Cheng Wanli; and Cheng Wanli completed the project with only 912 workdays at 7.5 *jin* of rice per workday. The original contract stipulated the use of 420,000 *jin* of lime, but only 350,000 *jin* were actually used. The amount of embezzlement in this case is calculated as follows: Wang Zhengyu, 3,313 *jin* of rice; Zhang Xiuwen, 3,250 *jin* of rice; Cheng Xianwen, 1,136 *jin* of rice; Bai Jinfeng, 1.35 million yuan. On May 2nd of this year, another embezzlement case of 40,000 *jin* of rice was discovered in the contractor's accounts, but the sharing was prevented because it was exposed. Based on the existing figures, the factory's total loss is equivalent to approximately 258,700 *jin* of rice!

Currently, General Affairs Section Chief Wang Zhengyu and five others, along with contractor Ni Shilu, have been handed over to the court for trial. The factory has also announced the expulsion of the main culprits, Wang Zhengyu, Bai Jinfeng, and Zhang Xiuwen. Cheng Xianwen and Zhang Wennian will remain at the factory for reflection and will be dealt with later. The comrades who correctly reflected the situation, actively assisted, and provided materials will be commended.

Factory Director Yan Shusong was ideologically paralyzed. The masses had repeatedly reported to him that the projects were poorly done and that materials were being stolen. However, he believed that these were financial matters and should be the responsibility of the deputy factory director. The deputy factory director said, "The main factory director handles the big issues; I am only responsible for a portion." It is evident that they only knew about division of labor and not cooperation, nor did they communicate with each other, which resulted in significant losses.

To educate the entire bureau, the North China Ordnance Bureau decided to give the factory director and deputy factory director disciplinary warnings. They also circulated this material to all subordinate factories to educate all employees, enhance their sense of responsibility, strengthen ideological leadership, and overcome the paralysis and irresponsible bureaucratic style of leadership, in order to prevent the occurrence of embezzlement incidents.

Editor's Note: The major embezzlement case that occurred at the North China Ordnance Bureau Repair Factory is an extremely serious event, causing the state a loss of 250,000 *jin* of millet. The occurrence of this case is due to the ideological paralysis of the factory's leadership, a lack of regular inspections, which gave the embezzlers an opportunity to exploit. These corrupt and degenerate criminals should be given the necessary punishment. The leading cadres of the factory should also conduct a thorough self-criticism in order to improve their future leadership work.

　　华北兵工局修造厂
    发生巨大贪污案
    案犯王正宇等已送法院审讯编者同志：
    我向你报告一件贪污案，事情发生在华北兵工局修造厂。该厂从去年七月到今年五月，先后由商人倪世禄等四人包做几个工程，工程费总计折合七十四万零八十五斤米。这项工程是由该厂庶务股长王正宇派张秀文、白金峰、程宪文三人负责估价与监工。包商倪世禄为了多包工程，便以各种利诱方法对他们进行拉拢。如请看戏、吃饭、送礼以及送钱等。在去年七月至十二月中，据该包商司账人说：有一次支出酬谢米四万斤（由张秀文取去，如何分配尚未查清），而在账上写的是买木料用。由于这种拉拢手段，从今年一月份起，该厂所有修建工程的投标办法，均已形成虚设。如有意抬高标价，不广泛的招集公私建筑部门估投，只是由倪等几人以改名换姓的手段取得承包。而厂方并不认真审查预算，亦未派人监标，只是认为王正宇能干，白、程是老人，不会有错的。
    该厂修一号仓库时，由倪世禄承包，向公家报二千七百五十个工，每工小米十六斤九两，而倪只用一千五百个工，每工十五斤米，转包给程万里；而程万里又仅以九百十二个工，每工七斤半米便完成了该项工程。原合同上规定应用石灰四十二万斤，但实际上只用了三十五万斤。此案贪污数字，计：王正宇三千三百十三斤米；张秀文三千二百五十斤米，程宪文一千一百三十六斤米；白金峰一百三十五万元。今年五月二日又在包商账上查出四万斤米的贪污案，因被揭发，伙分未逞。根据现有数字：该厂共计损失折合米约二十五万八千七百多斤！
    现庶务股长王正宇等五人和包商倪世禄已送交法院审讯。厂方并宣布将主犯王正宇、白金峰、张秀文三人开除出厂。程宪文、张文年留厂反省，以后再处理。对正确反映情况、积极协助，供给材料的几位同志则予以表扬。
    该厂厂长阎树松，思想麻痹，事前群众曾几次向他反映工程作的不好，偷工减料。但他认为这是有关财政的事应由副厂长负责。而副厂长则说：“大事有正厂长，我只负一部分责任。”可见只知分工，不知合作，亦不互相联系，因此造成重大损失。
    华北兵工局为了教育全局，决定给予正副厂长以批评处分。并通报所属各厂以此材料教育全体员工，提高工作责任心，加强思想领导，克服在领导上的麻痹和不负责任的官僚主义作风，以杜绝贪污事件的发生。
                重新
    编者按：华北兵工局修造厂所发生的巨大贪污案，是一件极为严重的事件，使国家损失了二十五万斤小米。该案的发生，其原因是由于该厂的领导上思想麻痹，平时缺乏检查，给了贪污分子以可乘之机。对于这伙腐化堕落的犯罪分子，应该给以必要的处分。该厂领导干部对此亦应加以深刻检查。以改进以后的领导工作。
