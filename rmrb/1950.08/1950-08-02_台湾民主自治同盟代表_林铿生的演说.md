Xinhua News Agency, 1st: Speech by Lin Kengsheng, representative of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, at the Beijing rally of all circles celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day and opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea: Fellow compatriots! Comrades! Now, on behalf of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, I will report to you on the American imperialists' conspiracy to invade Taiwan and the determination of the Taiwanese people to fight for liberation.

On June 27th, U.S. President Truman issued a presumptuous statement saying that he would not only attack Korea, but also interfere in China's internal affairs, obstruct the liberation of Taiwan, and interfere with the independence and freedom of the people of all of Asia.

We had anticipated this move by the American imperialists long ago. No matter how it has concealed its conspiracy in the past, we can see very clearly the path the imperialists must take. Our enemy used to wear a mask, but now it has revealed its true face and stands naked before us. The enemy that is most difficult to guard against is the enemy hidden where we cannot see it, or the enemy that pretends to be friendly with us. The American imperialists used to be like that. They pretended as if they had no ambitions, no bad intentions, and not only were unwilling to interfere in other people's affairs, but also shamelessly said that they were friends of the Chinese people. It takes a special effort to expose such an enemy. But now, it has taken off its mask and stands naked before us. Our broad masses of people can see this vicious enemy more clearly.

Good, we can see our enemy very clearly. And this enemy is very ignorant of its own limitations, believing that it has a strong navy, a strong air force, a large amount of materials, and atomic bombs, thinking that with these conditions, it can be an enemy of the world and do whatever it wants. Will we be intimidated by such an arrogant and stupid enemy? I dare to say no. Although it has materials and weapons, it cannot defeat the will of the broad masses of the people. The anger of the 6.5 million compatriots in Taiwan, the rise of the 480 million people in China, and the great strength of peace-loving people all over the world will surely defeat the imperialist conspiracy of aggression. I don't need to prove this in detail. Just look at the result of Japanese imperialism's invasion of China, and you can understand. Moreover, the strength of our People's Liberation Army today is far beyond comparison with the Anti-Japanese War era!

Our People's Liberation Army has been building the army since August 1, 1927, and today is its 23rd birthday. In these 23 years, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, it has gained rich experience: it has defeated an arrogant Japanese imperialism and eliminated the bandit troops of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries on the mainland. In 23 years of heroic struggle, we have strengthened our own strength and increased our infinite confidence; its glorious history is proof of its glorious future. If the American imperialists overestimate themselves, do not learn from their failure in Korea, and want to be enemies with the people of the world and carry out their crazy aggression against China, our People's Liberation Army must give them a resolute counterattack, so that they will more clearly know what the power of the Chinese people is all about!

At the same time, our Taiwanese people must also rise up to cooperate with the strength of the motherland, respond to the call of the broad masses of the people of the motherland, drive the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries out of Taiwan, and drive the American pirate troops out of our territorial waters!

Today, our neighbor Korea is engaged in a heroic struggle for its own liberation and independence against the American imperialist aggressor army, and has already achieved brilliant results. We believe that the Korean people will surely drive the invaders out of the country and achieve final victory. Because the Korean people, like our Taiwanese people, have encountered the cruel oppression and exploitation of Japanese imperialism in the past few decades. This tragic history has given the Korean people a deep understanding of the hideous face of imperialism and will never allow any imperialists to once again impose colonial rule on them. I can guarantee that the Korean people's hatred for the imperialists is the same as that of our Taiwanese people. Therefore, I can also conclude that the final victory must belong to the Korean people!

Oppose American aggression against Taiwan!
Oppose American aggression against Korea!
Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!
Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!
Long live Chairman Mao!
Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

### 台湾民主自治同盟代表  林铿生的演说

　　台湾民主自治同盟代表
    林铿生的演说
    【新华社一日讯】台湾民主自治同盟代表林铿生在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的演说：各位同胞！各位同志！现在我代表台湾民主自治同盟，向各位报告美国帝国主义者侵略台湾的阴谋，以及台湾人民争取解放的决心。
    六月二十七日，美国总统杜鲁门发表了一篇狂妄的声明，说他不但要进攻朝鲜，并且要干涉我们中国的内政，阻挠台湾的解放，干涉全亚洲人民的独立和自由。
    美国帝国主义这一套，是我们早就意料到的。尽管它已往怎样掩蔽它的阴谋，但是帝国主义者要走的路，我们是看得很清楚的。我们的敌人，以前戴着假面具，现在已经显露了它的真相，赤裸裸地站在我们面前了。我们跟敌人对阵，最难提防的是藏在我们看不见的地方的敌人，或者是跟我们假亲善的敌人。以前美国帝国主义者就是这样的。它假装得好像它是没有野心，没有坏意，不但不愿意干涉人家的事，而且还无耻地说它是中国人民的朋友。这样的敌人，我们要揭露它是特别费力。现在呢，它自己已经揭下来假面具，而且赤裸裸地站在我们面前了。我们的广大人民更清楚地认清这个凶恶敌人了。
    好了，我们已经很明显地看得见我们的敌人了。而且这个敌人很不自知轻重，认为它有强大的海军，强大的空军，大量的物资，而且有原子弹，以为有这些条件，它就可以与世界为敌，可以为所欲为了。这样妄自尊大的蠢敌，我们会被它吓倒么？我敢断定地说，不会的，尽管它有物资，有武器，是敌不过广大人民的意志的。台湾六百五十万同胞的愤怒，中国四万万八千万人民的奋起，全世界爱好和平人民的广大力量，一定能够战胜帝国主义的侵略阴谋。关于这点，我不必详细证明，就请大家看一看日本帝国主义侵略中国的结果就可以明了的，何况我们人民解放军今日的壮大已经远不是抗日时代所能比拟的了！
    我们人民解放军，自从一九二七年八月一日建军以来，今天已经是二十三岁的生日了。在这二十三年当中，它在中国共产党和毛主席、朱总司令正确的领导下，已经有了丰富的经验：它已经打垮了一个狂妄自大的日本帝国主义，又消灭了蒋介石反动派在大陆上的匪军。在二十三年的英勇斗争中，我们已经壮大了自己的力量，增加了无限的信心；它的光辉的历史，正是它辉煌的未来的证明。假如美国帝国主义者不自量力，不以在朝鲜的失败为教训，还要与世界人民为敌，还要进行它对中国疯狂的侵略的话，我们人民解放军一定要给它个坚决的回击，使它更明确的知道，中国人民的力量究竟是怎么回事！
    同时，我们台湾人民一定也要起来配合祖国的力量，起来响应祖国广大人民的呼声，把蒋介石反动派赶出台湾，把美国的海盗部队赶出我们的领海！
    今天我们的邻邦朝鲜，正在为自己的解放和独立，向美国帝国主义的侵略军作英勇的斗争，而且已经获得辉煌的战绩，我们相信，朝鲜人民力量一定会把侵略者驱逐出境，而取得最后的胜利的。因为朝鲜人民和我们台湾人民一样，在过去的数十年间，曾遇到日本帝国主义残酷的压迫和剥削。这一段悲惨的历史，使朝鲜人民对帝国主义的狰狞面貌有了深刻的认识，绝对不能容许任何帝国主义者对它们再来一次殖民地的统治。关于这一点我敢保证，朝鲜人民对帝国主义者的愤恨是和我们台湾人民一样的。所以我也可以断定，最后的胜利一定属于朝鲜人民的！
    反对美国侵略台湾！
    反对美国进攻朝鲜！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
