　　[Our newspaper's news] All representatives of the National Copying and Printing Conference sent a telegram to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army on "August 1st" to pay their respects. The telegram stated:

　　"Beloved Chinese People's Liberation Army, on the occasion of the 'August 1st' Army Day, we would like to express our highest respect to you with heartfelt affection!

　　For twenty-three years, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown stronger in extremely difficult circumstances; defeated Japanese fascism; and overthrown the Kuomintang reactionaries, causing American imperialism to lose its agents in China. The Chinese people, with the exception of Taiwan and Tibet, have all been liberated, allowing the Chinese people to live a life of freedom and democracy.

　　We absolutely wholeheartedly support the Common Program and Chairman Mao's guidance, and strive for the fundamental improvement of the country's financial and economic situation. Regarding the liberation of Taiwan and Tibet and the opposition to the aggression of American imperialism, we are willing to contribute all our strength to support the front lines."
