　　German National Front National Committee Holds Plenary Session
    Grotewohl Delivers Important Speech
    The development of the situation in West Germany requires the convening of a national congress to seek new forms of struggle. The Western occupation forces have become intervention forces, and the German people have the legitimate right to disobey their orders and carry out national resistance against them.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd dispatch] According to TASS, the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany held its fourth plenary session in Berlin on July 31. It was resolved to convene a national congress of the National Front in the near future, and to begin drafting a campaign platform for participation in the general election of People's Chamber representatives on October 15 this year. The meeting protested against the illegal deprivation of the parliamentary privileges of German Communist Party Chairman Lehmann by the West German authorities.
    Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic delivered an important speech at the meeting. He pointed out: Convening a national congress of the National Front is a necessity for the whole country. The path of development of the situation in West Germany requires the National Front to adopt new forms and methods of struggle. The task of the national congress is to find these new forms and methods.
    Grotewohl emphasized: The Western occupation forces remaining in West Germany are not carrying out the tasks entrusted to them by the Potsdam Agreement, but are engaging in the "Cold War." Therefore, they have lost the nature of occupation forces and have become intervention forces. This fact gives us the legitimate right not to carry out the orders of these occupying authorities, and also gives us the right to carry out national resistance.
    The delegates unanimously supported the resolution to convene the national congress and expressed that this congress will play a historic role in the German people's struggle for unity, peace, and national independence.

　　德全国阵线全委会举行全会
    格罗提渥作重要发言
    西德局势的发展要求召开全国代表大会，寻取新的斗争形式。西方占领军已变为干涉军，德国人民有合法权利不执行他们的命令，对他们进行全国抵抗。
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：民主德国全国阵线全国委员会于七月三十一日在柏林举行第四次全体会议，决议定于最近召开全国阵线全国代表大会，并着手草拟参加本年十月十五日人民议会代表普选的竞选纲领。会议对西德当局非法剥夺德国共产党主席雷曼的议员特权一事，提出抗议。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在会上作了重要发言。他指出：召开全国阵线全国代表大会是全国所必需的事情。西德局势发展的途径，要求全国阵线采取斗争的新形式和新方法。寻觅这些新形式和新方法，便是全国代表大会的任务。
    格罗提渥强调指出：西方占领军留在西德并不是在执行波茨坦协定所付托给他们的任务，而是在进行“冷战”，因此，他们已丧失了占领军的性质而变为干涉军了。这一事实，就使我们有了不去执行这些占领当局的命令的合法权利；也给了我们进行全国抵抗的权利。
    与会代表一致拥护召开全国代表大会的决议，并表示这次代表大会在德国人民争取统一、和平与国家独立的斗争中，将发生历史性的作用。
