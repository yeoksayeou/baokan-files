　　This Year's Farmland Water Conservancy Work
    Xu Da
    Since the widespread development of farmland water conservancy projects across the country in February and March of this year, considerable achievements have been made. A total of newly built and repaired canals, ponds, dams, waterwheels, wells, and other projects across the country have restored and increased the benefited area by 8.16 million mu. At the same time, the annual repairs and consolidation projects of irrigation areas covering 12.38 million mu have been completed. The smooth completion of water conservancy projects has basically guaranteed the task of increasing production. Moreover, since many canals were neglected for a long time and severely damaged during the Kuomintang rule, water conservancy cadres in various regions, after the establishment of the People's Government, actively led the masses with a high spirit of serving the people, and vigorously repaired water conservancy facilities. The benefited masses were greatly moved and, through the construction of water conservancy projects, realized that the People's Government is indeed their own government and truly serves the people, greatly enhancing their enthusiasm for production.

    In addition to the active leadership of the central and local governments in earnestly implementing the plan, the active participation of the People's Liberation Army in water conservancy construction played a significant role in the smooth progress of this year's water conservancy projects. The troops stationed in Xinjiang completed over 400,000 mu of water conservancy projects this spring. The three major state-owned water conservancy projects in Chahar Province, involving over 4.8 million cubic meters of earthwork, were entirely completed by the People's Liberation Army. During the project, unexpected difficulties such as quicksand, mud, clay, and tree roots were encountered, but the enthusiastic spirit of production and construction of all officers and soldiers overcame any difficulties and completed the task on schedule, ensuring that hundreds of thousands of mu of land could be silt-irrigated.

    The progress of water conservancy projects in various regions this year can be explained from two aspects. First, canal and pond dam projects: The situation in each region is as follows:

    (1) Northeast Region: Under the leadership of the Water Conservancy Bureau, three large-scale irrigation projects were built: the Panshan Farm, the Dongliao River Irrigation Area, and the Chahayang Farm, completing a total of 341 large structures, over 2,400 small structures, and 2.42 million cubic meters of earthwork. Liaodong Province focused on restoring the irrigation projects of Yingkou, Fuxian, Gaiping State-owned Farms, and seven other state-owned farms including Helong, Qianyang, and Gushan. Songjiang Province restored and built nine irrigation projects including Tianli, Datong, and Fumi. Jilin Province restored eight irrigation projects including Dunhua and Wangqingmen, and built one new Hunchun irrigation project. The above projects were basically completed in May and June and started to release water, with good results. A total of 24,132 hectares of paddy fields were added, 17,263 hectares of paddy fields were restored, and 16,633 hectares of irrigation projects were self-managed by various counties, totaling more than 58,000 hectares (870,000 mu) of increased and restored paddy fields, which are estimated to increase rice production by 23.2 million jin.

    (2) North China Region: Chahar Province completed the three major state-owned silt-irrigation projects of Sanggan River, Yu River, and Hun River in mid-July, building 359 new gates, culverts, bridges, and other structures, and completing 4.85 million cubic meters of earthwork. Water was released for silt-irrigation in early August. The small and medium-sized farmland water conservancy projects in various parts of Chanan and Yanbei have been most successful, building over a thousand canals and expanding the irrigated area by more than 400,000 mu. Shanxi Province has completed 199 large irrigation projects such as canals, dams, gates, and bridges, and 592 small irrigation projects. The main and branch canals of the Hutuo River irrigation project (planned irrigation area of 390,000 mu) and the inlet gates, diversion gates, railway bridges, and large vehicle bridges started construction in all aspects in June and are scheduled to be completed in mid-August. In addition, more than 600,000 mu of irrigated land was expanded during the spring and winter watering. In Hebei Province, the Jinmen Canal (planned irrigation area of 350,000 mu) has completed the first phase of canal earthwork and the canal head project, and has prepared most of the construction materials and is starting construction projects. The three canal projects of Heren, Shuiyuesi, and Funing are nearing completion, and the small Jin Hai Canal has been released for rice transplanting. The repair projects of twelve medium-sized canals such as Rongzhen and Lingzheng were completed and released before the wheat harvest. The masses in various regions have independently newly opened and repaired 705 small canals, adding approximately 170,000 mu of irrigated area. The repair projects of the three major canals of Guangji, Lifeng, and Chaiku in Pingyuan Province are expected to be completed before the end of July. In addition, 24 new small canals were opened, increasing irrigated land by 420,000 mu. The five counties of Liangcheng, Helin, Wudong, Xinghe, and Salachi in Suiyuan Province have completed 240,000 mu of water conservancy projects. The Ji Canal electric pumping irrigation and alkali washing project directly guided by the Ministry of Agriculture started to release water in early May, and the project of expanding the first branch canal and extending the fifth branch canal of the Shijin Canal irrigation project was also completed as scheduled in April and May.

    (3) East China Region: Shandong Province has completed irrigation projects such as the Xuhui Canal and the Xiaofu River. Under the leadership of the provincial government, the masses in various parts of Zhejiang Province universally carried out small-scale projects such as digging ponds and repairing dams, repairing more than 6,500 ponds and dams, digging more than 3,500 ponds, dredging more than 500 rivers and canals, and completing more than 22,000 other small projects. Southern Jiangsu has completed more than 7 million cubic meters of farmland water conservancy projects. Fujian Province has repaired 55 canals, 29 sluices, and 14 dikes.

    (4) Central South Region: From mid-March to around the wheat harvest, Henan Province repaired 233 old canals, dredged 457 ponds, repaired 682 water storage weirs, repaired 314 pond embankments, built 50 water-blocking dams, and dug 4 water storage ditches, increasing the irrigated area by 615,000 mu. Hunan Province restored 347 dikes and embankments, repaired 85,000 ponds, and repaired 120 canals. Hubei repaired 127 sluices and more than 7,900 ponds. Jiangxi Province has completed 3,386 small water conservancy projects such as the Wan'an and Anfu canals and other ponds and dams.

    (5) Northwest Region: Shaanxi Province has completed the first phase of the famous Luo Hui Canal project and the Dinghui and Leng Hui Canal projects, and has repaired large-scale canal projects such as the Han Hui, Bao Hui, and Xu Hui canals. Gansu Province has repaired ten irrigation projects in Hexi such as Gu Feng, Jing Feng, and Huangyang, which have all been completed. The nine counties of Gaolan and others have also built and repaired 368 li of small canals. Six water conservancy projects in Xinjiang Province, including Dihua Shawan, Suilai Xiaoguai, and Yanqi, have been completed. The repair projects of major trunk canals such as Hanyan, Daqing, and Tanglai in Hexi, Ningxia Province, were completed and released water on May 3, with a significantly increased water volume compared to the past. Qinghai Province has repaired canals such as Changsheng, Qigong, Ping'an, and Fanghui. A total of 850,000 mu of irrigated area has been increased and expanded in the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang.

    (6) Southwest Region: Focusing on restoring production, farmland water conservancy projects in various regions were repaired and consolidated, including annual repairs and consolidation of 18 irrigation projects in Western Sichuan such as Tongji Embankment, Zhu Li Great Embankment, and Dujiangyan, and improved and continued construction of 7 projects such as the Liangtan River irrigation project in Eastern Sichuan and the Sunzigou irrigation project in Northern Sichuan, totaling 25 irrigation projects with a benefited area of 4.24 million mu.

    Second, in terms of waterwheel and well irrigation projects, North China's five provinces and Shandong are the focus of development. A total of 100,500 waterwheels have been manufactured, more than 60,000 waterwheels have been loaned out, 62,000 wells have been drilled and repaired, and 291 machine wells and artesian wells have been drilled, increasing the irrigated area by approximately 1.183 million mu.

    Although considerable achievements have been made in this year's overall water conservancy projects, there are still some serious shortcomings in irrigation management. At present, except for some canals in Shaanxi Province and the North China region, irrigation institutions generally tend to neglect management work, lack sound management institutions and systems, and various feudal and extremely unreasonable management systems under the control of rural evil forces are still preserved. Before liberation, water disputes often occurred during water use, even leading to assaults and deaths. Due to unreasonable water distribution methods, water was wasted, reducing water utilization efficiency. The projects were not scientifically managed, leading to disrepair over the years and turning water conservancy into water disasters. Alkali land in irrigation areas has increased year by year, and the Hetao irrigation area in Suiyuan and Ningxia often floods, submerging cultivated land. The above situations were entirely caused by the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang government, but at present, a part of the leadership's ideology at all levels has failed to improve in time, allowing it to drift.

    During the farmland water conservancy projects in various regions this year, some areas still wasted manpower and material resources due to the lack of certain steps, unrealistic plans, and incomplete organization. However, the most common shortcoming is that in the farmland water conservancy work plans in various regions, there are only engineering plans, not water use plans, and they cannot be linked to planting. There are only designs for canal buildings, while important water use facilities and irrigation methods generally lack plans. Most of the farmland water conservancy engineering technicians only understand construction engineering and do not understand agricultural technology. It is not clear what the project is for, and the role of the project has not been specifically studied. Leaders at all levels mostly believe that completing the engineering plan means completing the task of farmland water conservancy, which is a major flaw in farmland water conservancy work. The occurrence of this situation is certainly due to the lack of information and unfamiliarity with the situation at the beginning of construction, but ideologically, part of it is influenced by European and American capitalist theories and methods, resulting in the erroneous concept of the separation of engineering and management, and the lack of connection between agriculture and water conservancy. This must be corrected quickly. It must be understood that the purpose of farmland water conservancy projects is to increase crop yields, so it is necessary to be good at organizing the masses, reasonable, timely, and appropriate irrigation, combined with agricultural technology, to improve soil fertility, so as to continuously increase production, so as to truly achieve the purpose of farmland water conservancy work. This point should be especially valued in the ideology of leaders at all levels to reverse the past bias.

　　今年的农田水利工作
    徐达
    今年的农田水利工程，自二三月间在全国各地普遍开展以来，已获得相当的成就，总计全国新修及修复渠道塘坝水车水井等项工程，共计恢复和增加受益面积八一六万亩，同时还完成了灌溉面积一、二三八万亩的岁修及整理工程。由于水利工程的顺利完成，基本上保证了增产任务；并且由于许多渠道，在国民党统治时代，长期失于养护修整，遭受严重破坏，人民政府成立以后，各地水利干部，以高度为人民服务的精神，积极领导群众，大力修整水利，受益群众受到极大的感动，通过兴修水利，认识到人民政府确实是人民自己的政府，真正是为人民服务的，生产情绪大为提高。
    今年水利工程的顺利进行，除了中央与各地政府积极领导群众认真贯彻计划外，各地人民解放军的积极参加水利建设，是发挥了极大的作用的，新疆驻军在今年春季完成了四十余万亩的水利工程，察哈尔省的三大国营水利工程四百八十多万公方的土方工程，是完全由解放军完成的，在工程进行当中，曾遇到不少流沙、泥水、胶泥、树根等意外难工，但在全体指战员的生产建设热烈情绪中，战胜了任何困难，如期完成任务，保证了数十万亩土地能够进行淤灌。
    今年各地水利工程进行情况，可分两方面来说明。第一、是渠道塘坝工程：各区的情况是这样的：
    （一）东北区：在水利总局领导下兴修了盘山农场，东辽河灌溉区及查哈阳农场等三处较大的灌溉工程，共完成较大建筑物三四一座，小型建筑物二千四百余座，土工二四二万公方。辽东省重点恢复营口、复县、盖平国营农场及合隆、前阳、孤山等七处国营农场灌溉工程，松江省恢复及修建天理、大通、富密等九处灌溉工程，吉林省恢复了敦化、汪清门等八处灌溉工程，新建珲春灌溉工程一处，以上工程均于五、六月间基本完成，并开始放水，情形良好。共增加水田二四、一三二垧，恢复水田一七、二六三垧，连同各县自办灌溉工程一六、六三三垧，共计增加、恢复水田五万八千余垧，（八十七万亩），估计可增产稻谷二三、二○○万斤。
    （二）华北区：察哈尔省已于七月中旬完成桑乾河、御河、浑河三大国营淤灌工程，新建闸门、涵洞、桥梁等建筑物三五九座，土方工程四八五万公方，八月初开始放水淤灌。察南、雁北各地中小型农田水利工程最有成绩，兴修渠道千余道，扩大灌溉面积四十余万亩。山西省已完成渠道、坝埝、闸门、桥梁等较大灌溉工程一九九件，小型灌溉工程五九二件，滹沱河灌溉工程（计划灌溉面积三九万亩）干支渠土方及进水闸、分水闸、铁路桥、大车桥等工程均于六月全面开工，预定八月中旬完工。此外并在春冬浇水当中，扩大水地六十余万亩。河北省的金门渠（计划灌溉面积三五万亩）已完成首期渠道土方工程及渠首工程，并已备妥大部工料，着手进行建筑工程，河任、水月寺、滏宁等三渠道工程已接近完成，小型的津海渠则已放水插秧。荣臻、灵正等十二处中型渠道修整工程已于麦收前完工放水。各地群众自行新开、修整小渠七○五道，共约增加灌溉面积十七万亩。平原省广济、利丰、柴库等三大渠道修整工程约于七月底前完工，另新开小渠二十四道，共增加水地四十二万亩。绥远省凉城、和林、武东、兴和、萨拉齐等五县已完成二十四万亩的水利工程。农业部直接指导的蓟运河电力抽水灌溉洗碱工程已于五月初开始放水，石津运河灌溉工程增修第一支渠及延长第五支渠工程也在四、五月间如期完工。
    （三）华东区：山东省已完成绣惠渠、孝妇河等灌溉工程。浙江省全省各地群众，在省府领导下普遍进行挖塘修坝等小型工程，修塘坝六千五百余处，挖塘三千五百余个，疏浚河渠五百余道，并完成其他小型工程二万二千余件，苏南已完成七百余万公方的农田水利工程，福建省已修渠五十五条，水闸二十九处，堤坝十四处。
    （四）中南区：河南省自三月中旬至麦收前后共修旧渠二三三道，浚塘四五七个，修蓄水堰六八二道，修塘堤三一四处，筑拦水坝五十处，挖蓄水沟四道，增加灌溉面积六十一万五千亩。湖南省修复堤垸三四七个，修塘八万五千个，修渠一二○道。湖北修水闸一二七座，修塘七千九百余个。江西省已完成万安、安福等渠及其他塘坝等小型水利工程三千三百八十六座。
    （五）西北区：陕西省已完成有名的洛惠渠第一期工程及定惠、冷惠二渠道工程，并修整了汉惠、褒惠、湑惠等大型渠道工程。甘肃省修整河西古沣、靖沣、黄羊等十处灌溉工程，已全部完工，皋兰等九县并兴修及修整小型渠道三六八里。新疆省迪化沙湾、绥来小拐、焉耆等六处水利工程已经完成。宁夏省河西的汉延、大清、唐徕等各大干渠修整工程已于五月三日完工放水，水量比以往大为增加。青海省则已修复长胜、祁公、平安、芳惠等渠。陕、甘、宁、青、新等五省共计增扩灌溉面积八十五万亩。
    （六）西南区：以恢复生产为主，进行修整各地农田水利工程，计岁修、修整川西的通济埝、朱李大埝、都江堰等十八处灌溉工程，改善及续办川东梁滩河灌溉工程、川北笋子沟灌溉工程等七处，综计二十五处灌溉工程，受益面积共为四百二十四万亩。
    第二、在水车水井灌溉工程方面，以华北五省及山东为发展重点，现已制造水车十万○五千辆，贷出水车六万余辆，打井及修复水井六万二千眼，凿机器井、自流井二九一眼，共约增加灌溉面积一一八万三千亩。
    今年在整个水利工程方面，虽然已经获得相当成绩，但在灌溉管理方面，仍存在着若干严重的缺点，目前除陕西省及华北区一部分渠道外，灌溉事业机构，都普遍存在着不重视管理工作的偏向，缺乏健全的管理机构和制度，在农村恶势力把持下的各种封建性的极端不合理的管理制度仍被保存着。解放前，在用水当中，时常发生水利纠纷，甚致酿成殴伤人命的事件，由于不合理的配水方法，以致浪费水量，降低水的利用效率，对工程也未加以科学管理，以致年久失修变水利为水害。灌区碱地逐年增加，绥远宁夏河套灌区经常洪水泛滥，淹没耕地。以上这些情况，完全是由于国民党政府反动统治所造成的，而在目前各级领导思想上一部分却未能及时加以改进，任其自流。
    今年各地在农田水利工程进行中，部分地区仍有因无一定的步骤，计划不够切实，组织不够周密，以致发生浪费人力、物力的情事。但是最普遍的缺点是在各地的农田水利工作计划中，只有工程计划，没有用水的计划，也不能和种植联系起来，只有渠道建筑物的设计，而重要的用水设施及灌溉方法则普遍缺乏计划，绝大部分的农田水利工程技术人员也多只懂修建工程而不了解农业技术，工程为了什么？不甚明确，工程作用如何？未加具体研究。各级领导思想上也多认为只要完成了工程计划就算完成了农田水利的任务，这是农田水利工作中的极大缺陷。这种情形的发生，固然因为才开始建设，资料缺乏，情况不熟悉，但是在思想上，一部分是受了欧美资本主义理论与方法的影响，造成工程与管理脱节，农业与水利互不联系的错误观念。这是必须迅速纠正的。须知农田水利工程的目的在于提高农作物收获量，因此必须善于组织群众，合理及时的适量灌溉，结合农业技术，提高土壤的肥沃程度，以求产量不断增加，才能真正达到农田水利工作的目的。这一点在各级领导思想上应当特别的加以重视，扭转以往的偏向。
