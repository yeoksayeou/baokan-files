　　Central South Military Region and Various Units of the Fourth Field Army
　　Launch Campaign Against American Aggression
    Commanders and Fighters Write Resolutions, Enhance Combat Effectiveness, and Resolutely Liberate Taiwan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 12th] The Central South Military Region and various units of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically launched a campaign against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. All commanders and fighters have unanimously and resolutely expressed their determination to liberate Taiwan, support the Korean people's war of liberation, and completely smash American acts of aggression. In the campaign, all units have universally carried out studies and discussions of the current situation. Many units have held forums for soldiers and model heroes, and the Communist Youth League members have also held speech meetings on Korean and Taiwan issues on League Day. The army newspapers closely cooperated with this campaign and published books and periodicals on the opposition to American aggression. After recognizing the American imperialists' ambition to invade Asia, the soldiers have become more firm in their belief that the People's Liberation Army will always be a fighting force. The soldiers pointed out that although the American imperialists' ambition for aggression is great, they are actually a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside. Some liberated soldiers who had fought in Burma during the Anti-Japanese War said, "American soldiers are really useless. They tremble at the sight of bayonets and grab their hats to use as shoehorns." People's model hero Qiao Zhongfa said: "This American paper tiger has already been punctured by the Korean people. No matter how frantically it invades, the Korean people will surely win the final victory of the liberation war, and we also have the confidence that we can and must liberate Taiwan. We must drive all the American imperialist invading troops out of our country's borders."
    In conjunction with the campaign against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea, various units have also continued to launch a signature campaign to defend world peace. Various units have also carried out propaganda work to defend world peace in their驻地（garrison）. The People's Air Force dropped leaflets in Wuhan and Guangzhou, opposing American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. The troops stationed in Changsha, in conjunction with the movement against American aggression, held a grand exhibition to introduce to the citizens the various American-made spoils of war seized by the People's Liberation Army from the Kuomintang bandit gangs during the Liberation War. Troops stationed in other places also carried out large-scale street propaganda. Through this campaign, all commanders and fighters and the masses in the garrison areas have greatly increased their hatred and vigilance against American acts of aggression, and have further recognized the great significance of the Korean People's Liberation War. Commanders and fighters have written resolutions, expressing their determination to step up their studies, improve their combat effectiveness, resolutely liberate Taiwan, stand at the forefront of national defense, and crush the armed aggression of American imperialism.

    【新华社汉口十二日电】人民解放军中南军区和第四野战军各部热烈展开反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动，全体指战员均一致坚决表示要解放台湾，支援朝鲜人民解放战争，彻底粉碎美国的侵略行为。各部在运动中都普遍地进行了目前形势的学习和讨论。许多单位召开了战士座谈会和功臣座谈会，青年团员也在团日举行了有关朝鲜、台湾问题的演讲会，部队报纸密切地配合了这一运动，出版了有关反对美国侵略的书刊。战士们在认清了美帝国主义侵略亚洲的野心之后，都更加坚定了人民解放军永远是战斗队的思想。战士们指出：美帝国主义的侵略野心虽大，实际上却是一只外强中干的纸老虎。抗日战争时期曾在缅甸作过战的一些解放战士说：“美国兵真是没有用，见了刺刀就发抖，抓起帽子当鞋蹬。”人民功臣乔忠发说：“美国这只纸老虎，朝鲜人民已经把它戳穿了，无论它怎样疯狂侵略，朝鲜人民一定将赢得解放战争的最后胜利，我们也有信心可以而且必须解放台湾。把美帝国主义的侵略军队一齐驱逐出祖国的国境。”
    与反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜运动相结合，各部并继续展开了保卫世界和平的签名运动。各部在驻地还进行了保卫世界和平的宣传工作。人民空军在武汉及广州市临空撒发了反对美国侵略台湾、朝鲜的传单。长沙市驻军结合反对美国侵略的运动，举行了盛大的展览会，向市民介绍人民解放军在解放战争中从国民党匪帮手中缴获来的各种美国制造的胜利品。其他各地驻军亦分别进行了大规模的街头宣传。经过这一运动，全体指战员及驻地群众大大地提高了对美国侵略行为的仇恨和警惕，并进一步认清了朝鲜人民解放战争的伟大意义。指战员们纷纷写下决心书，表示要加紧学习，提高战斗力，坚决解放台湾，站在国防的最前线，粉碎美帝国主义的武装侵略。
