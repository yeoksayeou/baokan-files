　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The Indian government has decided to provide field ambulances and other support for the US imperialist aggression in Korea, under the banner of the "United Nations." According to Agence France-Presse from Lake Success: The Indian government notified UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on July 29 that it was willing to provide the "United Nations" with some field ambulances and a medical team for use in Korea. Nehru pointed out in a telegram to Lie that India was willing to participate in the "United Nations" efforts in Korea.

　　Reuters, New York: The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune both published the news of India's willingness to provide medical assistance to US troops in Korea on their front pages on July 30. The New York Times cheered that Nehru's decision was "politically important" because it could reassure those who had tried hard to prove that India and the US bloc were consistent in their attitude toward the Korean action.

　　印决派一队医疗兵支持美国侵略朝鲜
    【新华社二日讯】印度政府已决定提供战地救护车等，支持挂着“联合国”招牌的美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略行动。据法新社成功湖讯：印度政府已于七月二十九日通知联合国秘书长赖伊说：印度政府愿以若干战地救护车及一队医疗兵供“联合国”在朝鲜之用。尼赫鲁在致赖伊的电报中指出：印度愿意参加“联合国”在朝鲜的努力。
    另据路透社纽约讯：美国纽约时报和纽约先驱论坛报七月三十日均以首页地位刊载印度愿以医药援助朝鲜美军的消息。纽约时报欢呼说：尼赫鲁这一决定，“在政治上是重要的”，因为它可以告慰这样一些人，他们曾极力想证明印度和美国集团在朝鲜的行动，在态度上是一致的。
