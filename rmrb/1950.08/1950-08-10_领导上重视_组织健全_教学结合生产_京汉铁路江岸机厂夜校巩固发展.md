　　Leadership Emphasizes, Organization Sound, Teaching Combined with Production
    Jiang'an Machine Factory Night School of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Consolidates and Develops
    [Our Wuhan Dispatch] Among the 103 workers' spare-time schools in Wuhan, with 13,500 workers participating in learning, the workers' night school of the Jiang'an Machine Factory of the Beijing-Hankou Railway is one of the most successful. Because the factory leadership attaches importance to workers' education, the school's organization is sound, and learning can be combined with production, several tense production campaigns have not affected the workers' learning, but have made them study even harder.
    The Jiang'an Machine Factory has more than 960 employees, of which illiterates account for about 30 percent. In January of this year, the factory had opened a night school for one term, with a total of 120 people participating in the study; the night school was expanded in April, and the number of students increased to 330. There are seven classes in elementary school and one class in junior high school. The curriculum focuses on Chinese language and arithmetic. Natural science is added in the third grade of elementary school, and geography and history are added in junior high school. The night school teachers are concurrently held by 20 people, including engineers, technicians, staff members of the factory, and teachers of the railway affiliated primary school. They study for two hours each on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings. Since the beginning of the school, the enthusiasm of students and teachers has been consistently high. Every day after dinner, before the learning time, the workers come to the night school to wait for class.
    The factory's leadership attaches importance to workers' learning, can guarantee workers' learning time, and clearly stipulates that no meetings or other activities can take up the workers' learning time on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings each week. Some unprepared and unimportant meetings were reduced, so that the workers' spare time life was regularized, and the teachers and students of the night school could attend classes on time without any worries. When mobilizing workers to enroll, the leaders of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League discussed in advance, decided on the education plan, and printed it out for everyone to discuss, so that the workers understood the purpose, requirements, and steps of learning. Before the start of the school, a test was also held, and the classes were divided according to the students' original cultural level. In addition to calling on members to participate in the night school, some Youth League branches also added a learning plan when formulating their own production plan to ensure that they would not be late or leave early, and strive for a score of over 80 in their studies.
    Each class in the night school has a fixed teacher. When hiring teachers, the leaders of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League first made careful considerations, jointly proposed a list, and exchanged views with the appointees, and put forward the call of "teaching workers to read is a glorious task." The teachers were very willing to take on this work. The school committee also issued letters of appointment, and at the same time gave a considerable subsidy per hour.
    The school committee is composed of the night school principal (the labor union's propaganda and education committee member), the vice principal (the deputy director of the factory), the director of studies, three teacher representatives, and four student representatives. They hold regular meetings and can effectively solve the administrative, teaching, and student problems of the night school, and implement the resolutions through representatives from all sides. For example, the third-grade students of the night school elementary school reported that one of the teachers had shortcomings in teaching methods. After studying, the school committee immediately helped him to improve through the teacher representatives, and the students were very satisfied. Some students had biases in their learning attitude, such as asking questions that were too far off topic, and memorizing words to death. The school committee also discussed this and helped these students correct their shortcomings through student representatives. The teachers also have joint meetings to exchange experiences to improve teaching methods. Therefore, they can make the teaching content related to the factory's production. For example, when the natural science teacher talked about "fire", he related it to the places in the factory where fire is used, the role and importance of fire in the factory, and then talked about the principle of combustion and the precautions that should be taken when using fire. For example, arithmetic classes used examples and exercises that were also closely related to the daily lives of the workers. The workers felt that they could use what they learned immediately, and they were very interested.
    During the "May Day", "May Fourth", model worker evaluation, and inventory movements, the night school was able to conduct propaganda and education among the workers in a timely manner, and used the time before and after class to allow students from various departments to concentrate on brewing discussions and exchange opinions, solving some production problems. These have played a role in promoting the factory's production. Everyone understood that "production is important, and learning is also important. Learning serves production." Therefore, the workers' night school was able to consolidate.

　　领导上重视·组织健全·教学结合生产
    京汉铁路江岸机厂夜校巩固发展
    【本报武汉讯】在武汉市一万三千五百多工人参加学习的一百零三个工人业余学校中，京汉铁路江岸机厂的工人夜校是办理得最有成绩的一个。由于该厂领导上重视工人教育，学校的组织健全，学习能够结合生产，几次紧张的生产运动都没有影响工人的学习，反而使他们学习得更起劲。
    江岸机厂有九百六十多个职工，其中文盲约占百分之三十。今年一月，该厂曾开办过一期夜校，参加学习的共一百二十人；四月份起夜校扩大，入学人数增至三百三十人。共分初小七个班，初中一个班。课程以国语、算术为主，初小三年级加授自然，初中班加授地理、历史。夜校教员由工厂的工程师、技师、职员和铁路附小的教员二十人兼任。每星期一、三、五晚上各学习两小时。从开学到现在，学员和教师的情绪始终饱满。每天晚饭后，还不到学习时间，工人们就到夜校来等候上课。
    该厂的领导上重视工人的学习，能够保证工人的学习时间，明确规定任何会议或其他活动都不能占用每星期一、三、五晚上工人学习的时间。减少了一些无准备、不重要的会议，使工人的业余生活有规律，夜校师生可以毫无牵挂地按时上课。在动员工人入学时，党、政、工、团的领导上事先讨论，决定了教育计划，并印出来发给大家讨论，使工人明了学习的目的、要求与进行的步骤。开学前并举行了测验，根据学员原有文化程度分编了班次。青年团支部除号召团员参加夜校外，有的团员并在订自己的生产计划时加订学习计划，保证不迟到早退，学习成绩要争取在八十分以上。
    夜校各班都有固定的教员。在聘定教员时，党、政、工、团领导上首先作了慎重的考虑，共同提出名单，并与被聘者交换了意见，提出了“教工人识字是光荣任务”的号召。教员们都很愿意担任这一工作。校委会并发了聘书，同时每小时给予相当的津贴。
    校委会是由夜校校长（工会宣教委员）、副校长（副厂长）、教务主任、教员代表三人和学员代表四人组成。他们定期开会，能够切实解决夜校行政上、教学上和学员所要求解决的问题，通过各方面代表来贯彻决议。例如夜校初小三年级同学反映有一位教员的教学方法有缺点，校委会研究后，即通过教员代表帮助他立刻改进，学员非常满意。某些学员在学习态度上有偏向，如发问时离题太远，死啃字眼，校委会也加以讨论，并通过学员代表帮助这些学员把缺点纠正了。教员们还有联席会议，通过它来交流经验，以改进教学方法。因此，他们能做到教学内容联系本厂的生产。例如自然教员讲“火”时，就联系到本厂那些地方要用火，火在工厂的作用及重要性，再讲燃烧原理和用火时应注意的地方。又如算术课举例题和作练习，也多联系工人的日常生活。工人们感到学了马上就能用，兴趣很高。
    在“五一”、“五四”、评模、清点等运动中，夜校都能及时地在工人中进行宣传教育，并利用上课、下课的时间使各部门学员集中酝酿讨论，交换意见，解决了生产上的一些问题。这些，对该厂的生产都起了推动作用。大家都明白了“生产要紧，学习也要紧。学习是为生产服务的。”因此工人夜校就能够巩固起来。
