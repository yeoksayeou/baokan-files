Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 26th: Under the leadership and support of the state banks, private financial institutions in Wuhan have initially overcome difficulties and have begun to embark on the road of serving production. Their business has also turned from loss to profit. Of the 32 existing private banks in Wuhan, 21 achieved a profit in July, a significant improvement compared to only 6 in May.

Most of the private banks in Wuhan have weak capital. During the period of inflation, they relied on speculation for profit, resulting in excessive credit. When currency stabilized, their serious weaknesses were exposed, putting them in extremely difficult situations. In April of this year, most of the private banks' loans were for speculative purposes, and 74% were unrecoverable. To help private banks overcome difficulties, the Hankou branch of the People's Bank of China, adhering to the principle of considering both public and private interests, lowered the reserve ratio for bank deposits, relaxed credit loans to banks, removed some restrictions on interbank lending, and started providing bank rediscounting and re-deposit services from May of this year. Under the leadership of the state banks, private banks have formulated business plans and implemented economic accounting since May. The overall expenses of all banks in the city decreased by 60% in June compared to April. At the same time, several banks have strived to replenish their capital. Seven banks have successively increased their working capital by a total of 25 billion yuan. After the Hankou Commercial Bank increased its working capital by 9 billion yuan in July, its lending capacity doubled, and its interest income also increased. The bank lost 6.98 million yuan in June, but made a profit of 9.5 million yuan in July. Some banks are turning to serve industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Comparing the average loan balance in July with that in February, loans for import-export and supply-marketing trade increased from 2.65% in February to 15.25%; the total amount of loans also increased from 140 million yuan to 6.3 billion yuan. Bad debts of banks accounted for 74% of the total loan amount in April, but had decreased to 3% by June 10. Remittance business had tripled by the end of July compared to the end of April.

In the private financial sector in Wuhan, there was also one bank, Dafu Bank, which, due to its failure to change its operating methods and rectify its internal affairs, continued to deepen its difficulties and eventually ceased operations. Among the 34 employees of the bank, shareholders who were also deputy managers accounted for 15, most of whom received fixed salaries. The bank's personnel and miscellaneous expenses accounted for 85% of the total expenditure in June. The operating methods were also outdated, and the bank violated financial laws 15 times in May. Issuing bad checks was also the most common practice of the bank. One shareholder's loan in April accounted for 14% of the bank's total loans. The bank's lending business was greatly affected by the above reasons, and the deficit increased month by month, finally leading to its voluntary closure at the end of July.

　　武汉市私营行庄
    走上为生产服务道路
    营业由亏损转向盈余
    【新华社汉口二十六日电】在国家银行领导和扶助下，武汉市私营金融业已初步克服困难，并开始走上为生产服务的道路，他们的营业也由亏损转向盈余。武汉市现有的私营行庄三十二家中七月份有二十一家获得盈余，较五月份仅有六家盈余的情况大有起色。
    武汉市私营行庄大都资力薄弱，在通货膨胀时期，靠投机获利，因此信用浮滥。当通货稳定后，它们的严重的弱点暴露出来了，这使它们自己处在极困难的境地中。今年四月间全年私营行庄的大部分都是以投机为目的的放款，有百分之七十四收不回来。中国人民银行汉口分行为帮助私营行庄克服困难，本公私兼顾的原则，自今年五月份起降低了行庄存款准备金的比率，放宽了行庄的信用贷款，取消了同业拆借资金的一些限制，并开办了行庄的转质押和再存款。在国家银行的领导下，私营行庄自五月份起编制了业务计划，实行经济核算，全市行庄的各项开支，六月份比四月份缩小了百分之六十。同时，若干行庄努力充实资力，有七家行庄先后增加流动资金共达二十五亿元。汉口商业银行七月份增加九亿元流动资金后，放款能力扩大一倍，利息收入也跟着增加。该行六月份还亏损六百九十八万元，到了七月份便盈余九百五十万元，有些行庄正转向为有利国计民生的工商业服务。以七月份和二月份放款平均余额相比较，出进口供销贸易的放款从二月份的百分之二点六五增加到百分之十五点二五；放款总额也由一亿四千万元增至六十三亿元。行庄放款呆账四月间占放款总额的百分之七十四，六月十日已减至占百分之三。汇兑业务，七月底已比四月底扩大了三倍。
    武汉市私营金融业中也有一家由于未改变经营方式和整顿内部，以致困难继续加深终致停业的，这就是大孚银行。该行全体职员三十四人中，股东兼副经理的占十五人，大部分是领干薪的。该行六月份人事费和杂费占到总开支的百分之八十五。经营方式也还是老一套，五月份违反金融法令十五次。开空头支票也是该行最多。有一个股东四月份的借款占了该行放款总数的百分之十四。该行放款业务由于上述原因受到很大的影响，赤字也逐月增大，到七月底终于自动停业。
