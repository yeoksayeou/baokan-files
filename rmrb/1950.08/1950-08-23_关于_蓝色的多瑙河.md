Regarding "The Blue Danube"
This publication received a criticism from Comrade Zhu Fei regarding the Huadong Xinhua Bookstore edition of "The Blue Danube," written by Gonchar and translated by Xu Kegang, pointing out many errors in the translation. However, the translation errors pointed out by Comrade Zhu Fei were only partial. We forwarded his opinions to the Huadong Xinhua Bookstore, hoping that they would conduct a complete inspection of the translation and inform us of the results. After inspection, the Huadong Xinhua Bookstore discovered many other mistranslations, and the original translator also made a self-criticism and statement. Due to space limitations, Comrade Zhu Fei's criticism and Comrade Xu Kegang's reply to the Huadong Xinhua Bookstore will not be published in this issue. Now, the Huadong Xinhua Bookstore Editorial Department's self-criticism is published as follows:

Regarding the errors in the translation of the book "The Blue Danube" (written by Gonchar and translated by Xu Kegang) published by us, pointed out by Comrade Zhu Fei, we have re-examined it and discovered many other mistranslations. This proves that we have a serious and careless work style. In addition to stopping the reprinting of the book and notifying the translator, we make the following self-criticism:

When we received this translation, due to the lack of cadres proficient in foreign languages at that time, a comrade who had some understanding of English was assigned to review it. This comrade proofread part of the translation against the original text. However, due to limited proficiency, although some individual inappropriate points were discovered, the serious errors in the translation were not discovered. At the same time, it was felt that the translation was relatively fluent, so we were careless and let it pass. The comrade who did the final review only paid attention to whether there were any political problems and did not pay attention to the translation problems. Therefore, no in-depth research or detailed proofreading by comrades proficient in English was done, and the decision to publish was made in this way. This shows that we are not serious and conscientious enough about publications.

We are extremely grateful to Comrade Zhu Fei for pointing out the errors in our publications. We will definitely handle manuscripts with a high degree of seriousness in the future and earnestly overcome the careless and rash work style in our work.

　　关于“蓝色的多瑙河”
    本刊曾收到朱菲同志对徐克刚译、冈察尔著、华东新华书店版“蓝色的多瑙河”的批评，指出译本上很多错误。但是朱菲同志所指出的译文错误还只是部分的，我们将他的意见转给了华东新华书店，希望将译本作全部的检查，并将结果告诉我们。华东新华书店在检查之后，发现了其他很多误译，原译者也作了检讨与声明。因为篇幅关系，朱菲同志的批评和徐克刚同志给华东新华书店的答复都不拟在本刊发表。现在，将华东新华书店编辑部的检讨照刊如次：
    朱菲同志对我们出版的“蓝色的多瑙河”（冈察尔著、徐克刚译）一书所指出译文的错误，经我们重新校勘的结果，发现了还有其他很多误译，这证明我们在工作中存在着严重的粗枝大叶的作风，除将该书停止重印并通知译者外，特作检讨如下：
    我们收到这部译稿的时候，因为那时缺乏精通外文的干部，就由一个稍懂英文的同志进行审查，该同志曾将译稿一部与原文作过校阅，因为限于水平，虽然也发现了一些个别不妥的地方，但并未能发现译文的严重错误，同时觉得译文还比较流畅，就粗心大意放松过去。而复审的同志，只注意政治上有无问题，未注意翻译上的毛病，因此未作深入研究和精通英文同志的详细校阅，就这样决定出版，这表现了我们对出版物的不够郑重和认真。
    我们极其感谢朱菲同志对我们出版物的指正。我们以后一定以高度的严肃精神来处理稿件，切实克服我们工作中的粗枝大叶的轻率作风。
