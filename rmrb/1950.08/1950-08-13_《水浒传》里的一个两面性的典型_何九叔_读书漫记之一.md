　　A Typical Ambivalent Character in "Water Margin" - Uncle He Jiu
    —Reading Notes 1
　　Wang Chaowen
    One of the important features of "Water Margin" is the unusually distinct and rich characterization of its figures. Not only are many heroes well portrayed, but also many non-heroic characters are depicted with distinct personalities. In Chapters 24 and 25, He Jiu, a non-major character, appears and possesses a distinct personality.
    He Jiu, known as Uncle He Jiu, is a worldly-wise figure, considered shrewd and capable in the old society. He is smooth, clever, and seeks only to live in peace. He belongs to a type of personality that dares not lean to one side, constantly trying to adapt to the environment to protect himself. As the events of the poisoning of Wu Dalang unfold, his character gradually manifests itself in his actions. The author does not provide any trivial, so-called concrete descriptions of his appearance, nor does he engage in false or excessive exaggeration. Yet, this character, who does not actively participate in the struggle but is passively drawn into it, seems to stand right before us. In terms of creative method, the appearance of this character, in addition to explaining and enriching the plot, may be intended to contrast with heroes like Wu Song, who dare to act and take responsibility for their struggles for a specific purpose; but it can also be said to be for a more realistic depiction of human relationships in feudal society.
    When He Jiu unexpectedly receives a toast and hospitality from the local tyrant Ximen Qing, his alertness is immediately apparent.
    "This man has never drunk with me before; there must be something fishy about this cup of wine."
    Knowing that Ximen Qing would not give him silver for no reason, he does not dare to accept the silver easily, but he does not dare to refuse it outright either. "I have no ability to be of service at all; how dare I accept the generous gift of silver from you, sir?"
    Immediately following this is compromise. "Even if you have something you want me to do, sir, I dare not accept (the silver)."
    Clearly knowing that the price of this silver is to cover up a crime, he still puts on an appearance of loyalty and support: "Is it just these small matters? What harm is there? How dare I accept the silver?"
    When he accepts the bribe of silver and arrives at Wu Da's house, he first guesses the specific reason Ximen Qing gave him the silver from Pan Jinlian's appearance. When he sees Wu Da's corpse, his specialized experience in examining corpses allows him to immediately understand the cause of Wu Da's death, revealing his shrewd and capable characteristics everywhere. In order to escape responsibility, he cleverly and skillfully pretends to be poisoned, "crying out loudly, falling backward, spitting out blood from his mouth..."
    He Jiu deceives everyone and is carried home. In his private room, he explains to his weeping wife that this is just a pretense and reveals his plight in the cracks of society.
    "I wanted to speak out, but I fear that he will have no one to answer to. Offending Ximen Qing is like stirring up a hornet's nest. If I were to hastily put him in the coffin and bury him, Wu Da has a brother who is Wu the Constable, the tiger-slayer on Jingyang Ridge. He is a man who kills without batting an eye. If he returns sooner or later, this matter will surely come to light."
    The solution to this predicament is his wife's plan: secretly hide Wu Da's bones, so that if Wu Song returns and investigates, it can serve as evidence to clear He Jiu of being biased towards Ximen Qing, making people believe he is a fair and good person.
    "If he (Wu Song) comes back, if he doesn't ask, that's fine, but wouldn't that save Ximen Qing's face? Making him a meal, wouldn't that be good?"—Clearly, she is teaching him the method of pleasing both sides.
    He Jiu, agreeing with this approach and attitude, instructs his assistants to prepare the body for burial, report the date of the funeral, and says the assistants can share the money and silk, but, "If you give me money and silk, don't." He meticulously tries to protect himself in every way. Then comes the description of how skillfully and carefully he hides the bones, in order to deal with possible investigations, revealing his experience. But at the same time, it shows his pain, his timidity. This always shrewd head of the neighborhood, facing Wu Song, who rolls up his sleeves, holds a sharp knife, and declares, "...'Every wrong has its doer, every debt has its debtor!' Don't be afraid..." completely loses the calm attitude he had in front of Ximen Qing, and cannot control himself. The author further depicts his timidity. He Jiu hands over the evidence of Wu Da's poisoning, but does not directly state the specific circumstances of the murder; he introduces Wu Song to Yun Ge, who sells pears, but dares not testify in court himself, excusing himself midway… This further depicts his selfishness. According to the author's understanding, the truth is of course on Wu Song's side; whether this understanding is entirely correct or not, at least the truth is not on Ximen Qing's side. He Jiu clearly knows what should be opposed and what should be supported; but for the sake of personal safety, he does not dare to stand up and clarify right and wrong. In the face of sharp struggles between two forces, he is often caught in a dilemma; when one side (of course, also the side he believes is correct) gains the upper hand, he comes out to speak justly, but his starting point for speaking justly is to protect himself, not to support "truth," so he cannot speak with confidence. His participation in the struggle is entirely passive, so he always wants to excuse himself and does not dare to fight resolutely to the end. Compared with Wu Song, Shi Xiu and others, the difference is very obvious.
    The formation of He Jiu's ambivalence has its objective reasons. Under the oppression of evil forces like Ximen Qing, if one does not stand up and clearly oppose them, or willingly become their henchmen, helping the oppressors to oppress the people, one can often only temporarily live in the cracks.
    Although "Water Margin" does not explicitly reveal the conditions for the formation of such "smart" characters, the author, through his secret dealings with his wife and his placement between Ximen Qing, who controls the government, and Wu Song, who kills without batting an eye, and his placement in sharp contrast to the young Yun Ge, who dares to come forward and testify in court, the reasons for the formation of such a selfish, cowardly, cunning, and troubled "smart person" can still provide some insight.
    He Jiu can indeed be called a type, and he can evoke more similar associations. One cannot but admire the author's skill in creating such a vivid typical character; but is this only due to the author's skill? No. It should be said that it is because the author of the novel, or the authors of the folk tales, are very familiar with this kind of character. The same principle applies to primitive people who have never attended a specialized art school, but are able to vividly depict wild oxen because they repeatedly and thoroughly familiarize themselves with them.
    The characters in "Water Margin" are diverse. He Jiu is not treated carelessly and turned into a character without substance just because he does not belong to the ranks of the 108 heroes. He is not an empty symbol, but a living and representative figure with flesh and blood. Regardless of whether his position in "Water Margin" is to serve as a foil for the heroes, or to explain and enrich the developing plot, he is indeed being treated seriously. He is being carefully depicted in specific environments and specific actions. To learn from old literature is by no means to apply old styles; how credibly, richly, and simply it portrays characters is one of the good things worth learning.
    In addition to the many things to learn from "Water Margin" in terms of creative methods, there are also noteworthy aspects for understanding people. Because the old society poisoned people so deeply, attitudes and methods of dealing with problems similar to He Jiu's cannot disappear overnight in the new society. Although our standards of heroes and cowards differ from those held by Shi Nai'an, and the truth we should uphold today is not exactly the same as the "truth" that Wu Song insisted on, this "self-preservation" attitude and method of dealing with the world is not forgivable. In reforming our thinking and work style, this novel still has some reference value; it should not be ignored just because it is an old novel produced in the feudal era. It is said that many friends who reform old operas like to focus on Pan Jinlian, but often fail to give the poisoning of Wu Da event a new meaning; I think that if He Jiu is taken as the center and made into a short play, appropriately satirizing such a character, it would not be of less significance than rewriting Pan Jinlian and the like.

　　《水浒传》里的一个两面性的典型——何九叔
    ——读书漫记之一
　　王朝闻
    《水浒传》的重要特色之一，是人物性格异常鲜明、异常丰富。不仅很好地刻画了许多英雄，也性格鲜明地刻画了许多不是英雄的人物。在第二十四、五回里，出现一个并非主要人物的何九，就具备了性格鲜明的特色。
    何九，人称何九叔，是一位饱经世故，在旧社会里被称为精明能干的人物。圆滑、机灵、苟且偷安。他属于一种不敢一边倒，时刻设法适应环境以保护自己的性格。随着药杀武大郎的事件的发展，逐步在行动中表现出他的性格。作者没有在他的外貌上作什么琐碎的所谓具体的描写，也没有虚伪的过火的夸张。但这一个不敢积极参加斗争，被动地卷入了斗争的人物却好像就站在我们面前。在创作方法上，这个人物的出现，除开为了交代情节和丰富情节之外，可能是为了衬托武松这些为着一定的目的而斗争的敢作敢当的英雄；但也可以说是为了更真实的描绘封建社会的人间关系。
    当何九出于意外地受到恶霸西门庆劝酒招待时，就显出他的机警。
    “这人从来不曾和我吃酒，今日这杯酒必有跷蹊。”
    明知西门庆不会无故送他银两，也不敢轻易接受他的银两，但他却不敢毅然拒绝。“小人无半点效力之处，如何敢受大官人见赐银两？”
    紧接着就是妥协。“大官人便有使令小人处，也不敢受（银两）。”
    明白知道这银两的代价是为了包庇一种罪恶，他仍装出忠诚拥护的神气：“是这些小事，有甚利害，如何敢受银两？”
    当他接了贿赂银两，来到武大家，首先从潘金莲外表上猜出了西门庆给他银两的具体原因。及至看到武大尸首，由于验尸的专门经验，使他立刻了解武大致死原因，处处显出他精明能干的特点。为了逃避责任，机智地巧妙地假装自己中毒，“大叫一声，望后便倒，口里喷出血来。……”
    何九骗了众人，被抬回家去，私室里对哭着的老婆说明这不过是装病，也说出他在夹缝中的苦况。
    “我本待声张起来，却怕他没人做主，恶了西门庆却不是去撩蜂剔蝎？待要胡卢提入了棺，殓了，武大有个兄弟，便是前日景阳岗上打虎的武都头，他是个杀人不眨眼的男子。倘或早晚归来，此事必然要发。”
    解救这种夹缝中的苦况的，是她的老婆的计策。——偷藏武大骨殖，以备万一武松归来追究时，好作为洗刷何九并非偏护西门庆的材料，使人相信他是公正的好人。
    “他（武松）若回来，不问便罢，却不留了西门庆面皮，做一碗饭，却不好？”——分明是教导他两面讨好的方法。
    同意这样处理问题的方法和态度的何九，吩咐伙家们自去殓尸，回报出丧时日，伙家们可以分取钱帛，但是，“若与我钱帛，可不要。”处处周到地设法保护自己。紧接着描写如何巧妙地细心地偷藏骨殖，以便应付可能发生的追究等等，分明显出他的老练。但同时显出他的痛苦，他的怯懦。这位一向精明的团头，面临着卷起双袖握着尖刀申言着“……‘冤各有头，债各有主！’你休惊怕……”的武松，完全失却了在西门庆面前的那种平静的态度，不能自持。作者进一步刻画了他的怯懦。何九交出武大中毒证件，又不直接说出杀人的具体情况；他介绍武松去找卖梨儿的郓哥，自己不敢到官府作证，中途告退。……这里更进一步地描写了他的自私。按作者的认识，真理当然在武松方面；不论这种认识是否十分正确，但是，真理至少不在西门庆那一边。何九明明知道什么是应该反对的，什么是应该拥护的；由于为了个人的安全，不敢挺身而出，辩明是非。在两种力量尖锐斗争时，常常是左右为难；当某一方面（当然也是他认为正确的一方）占了上风，虽然也出来说公道话，但他说公道话的出发点是为了保护自己而不是为了拥护“真理”，因此说话也不能理直气壮。他参加斗争完全是被动的，所以随时都想告退，不敢坚决斗争到底。他和武松、石秀等人相比较，区别是很显然的。
    何九的两面性的形成，有他的客观原因。在西门庆这种恶霸势力压迫之下，如果不挺身而出，明明白白地和他们作对，或者甘心作爪牙，帮助压迫者压迫人民，常常只有暂时在夹缝中过活。
    《水浒传》虽然没有十分明确地揭出这样的“聪明”人物的形成条件，但作者通过他和老婆的密谋之类的行动，并把他按插在把持官府的西门庆与杀人不眨眼的武松之间，把他按插在不顾一切，敢于出头到官作证的少年郓哥之间而形成了鲜明的对照；对于这样一个自私的怯弱的狡猾的苦恼的“聪明人”的形成原因仍可以得到某些启示。
    何九，确可以称得起是一种典型，他可以引起更多类似的联想。能够创造这样生动的典型人物，不能不佩服作者技巧的高强；但这只由于作者的技巧的高强吗？不是的。应该说是由于小说作者，或民间传说的作者们非常熟悉这一类人物的缘故。如同并没有上过美术专门学校的原始人，由于反复地透彻地熟悉着野牛，所以也能生动的刻画野牛的道理是一样的。
    《水浒传》中的人物性格是多采多样的。何九，并没有因为他不属于一百零八人之列就被马虎处理，而变成无实感的影子。他不是一个空洞的符号，而是一个有血肉的活的而且具有代表意义的人物。不管他在《水浒传》中所处的地位是不是为了衬托英雄，或者是不是为了交代和丰富发展中的情节，他确是被认真地处理着。在具体环境具体行动中被认真刻画着。要向旧文艺学习，决不是旧格调的套用；它如何可信地丰富而又朴质地刻画人物，就是很值得学习的好处之一。
    《水浒传》除了创作方法上有很多可学之处，就是为了认识人，也有值得注意的地方。由于旧社会给人们的毒害太深，在新社会里，近似何九的这种处理问题的态度和方法一下子不能绝迹。虽然我们和施耐庵所持的英雄与懦夫的标准不同，今天应该坚持的真理也不就是武松坚持的那样的“真理”，但这种“明哲保身”的处世态度和方法是值不得原谅的。在改造思想与工作作风上，这部小说多少还有一些供参考的作用；不因为它是封建时代产生的旧小说而可以漠视。据说不少改革旧剧的朋友喜欢在潘金莲上面用功夫，但往往不能使药杀武大事件具备新的意义；我以为，如果以何九作为中心，改成一个短剧，适当的讽刺这样一种性格，不会比改写潘金莲之类的意义小的。
