　　Beijing Holds Symposium on Public and Private Publishing Industries
    Discussing Public-Private Relations and Criticizing Unserious Attitudes in Publishing Work
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Beijing News Office, the Beijing Municipal People's Government's News and Publishing Department held a symposium on the publishing industry in Beijing on the 7th and 8th of this month at the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce. More than 120 representatives from public and private publishing houses, book sales businesses (including bookstores and book stalls), printing houses, and magazine publishers attended. The General Administration of Publications also sent representatives Xu Boxin, Shi Yucai, and Tang Jihong to attend and provide guidance. At the symposium, the representatives provided detailed introductions of their respective units' operating situations and existing difficulties. There was also a wide-ranging discussion on the issue of public-private relations. It was unanimously agreed that relations between the public and private sectors should be established on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. The private sector particularly hoped to receive assistance and consideration from the public sector in terms of processing, ordering, and wholesale distribution. The symposium also reviewed and criticized sloppy publishing and pirated books, believing that this was due to editors and publishers not adopting a responsible attitude towards the people. The most fundamental reason, however, was the generally low level of political and ideological awareness of publishers and editors. Therefore, strengthening study, transformation, and self-education is a very important issue. The representatives also exchanged opinions on the preliminary list of representatives from the Beijing private publishing industry to attend the National Publishing Conference, which was proposed by the Beijing News and Publishing Department. This meeting prepared part of the groundwork for the upcoming National Publishing Conference.

    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：京市人民政府新闻出版处于本月七、八两日假市工商业联合会召开了北京市出版业座谈会。出席公私营出版业、图书贩卖业（包括书店和书摊）、印刷业和杂志社的代表一百二十余人。出版总署并特派代表徐伯昕、史育才、汤季宏等出席指导。在座谈会上，代表们很详尽的介绍了本单位在经营中的情况及存在着的困难问题。在公私关系的问题上，也有较广泛的讨论。一致认为：公私之间，应该在平等互利的原则下建立关系。私营方面特别希望在加工、定货、批销等方面能得到公营方面的扶助与照顾。座谈会对草率的出版及翻版书也作了检讨与批判，认为这是编者和出版者没有采取对人民负责的态度；而一般出版者与编者的政治思想水平不高，却是最基本的原因，因而加强学习改造与自我教育，是很重要的问题。代表们对京市新闻出版处提出的京市私营出版业出席全国出版会议代表初步名单，也交换了意见。这个会，为即将召开的全国出版会议作好了一部分准备工作。
