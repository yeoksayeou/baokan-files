Xinhua News Agency, July 31st: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued the following notice regarding preparations for the National Conference of Representatives of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers:

    The State Council of the Central People's Government issued a decision on July 26th to convene the National Conference of Combat Heroes Representatives and the National Conference of Representatives of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers on September 25th. The conference will summarize and exchange valuable experiences from the military and production fronts, and commend various heroes and role models. This will greatly promote the final annihilation of the remaining bandits in Taiwan and Tibet, as well as the ongoing national economic construction. We fully support the State Council's decision to convene this conference. The entire working class should mobilize, launch mass production competitions, and use practical actions to welcome this conference; use practical achievements in production to respond to the call of the State Council in the decision: "Promote new labor attitudes, overcome difficulties, improve labor productivity," to "serve the great cause of liberating all the territory, developing production and prosperity, and building a new China."

    All levels of trade union organizations must attach importance to the great significance of this conference and promptly and conscientiously carry out preparatory work. Based on the principles of the State Council's decision, and on the basis of the existing model worker movement, adopt a highly serious attitude to elect representatives who have made significant contributions to production and construction and are recognized and supported by the masses. Therefore, the election of representatives must go through democratic discussions by the workers and staff of the production units that produce the representatives, in order to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education, and truly ensure that the hero model representatives supported by the masses are elected. If there are not enough suitable candidates, the trade union may send alternate representatives equivalent to the quota of model workers. The allocation of representative quotas should appropriately take into account the appropriate proportion of various industries (including military industry in each region), regions with different circumstances, public and private enterprises, and the number of engineering and technical personnel and female workers.

    The State Council stipulates a quota of 40 representatives for the North China region, which is allocated as follows: Beijing 4, Tianjin 8, Hebei 10, Shanxi 8, Chahar 5, Pingyuan 3, Suiyuan 2.

    After receiving this notice, major administrative regions, provinces, municipalities, local trade unions, and industrial trade unions should formulate specific plans for welcoming the National Conference of Representatives of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers and selecting model workers, report to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions before August 15th, and prepare all the necessary materials for the conference of representatives of model workers on schedule.
