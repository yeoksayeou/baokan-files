　　Beating the Beast
    ——Written to Oppose the American Imperialist Aggression Against Korea
    Wang Yaping
    Beasts and poisonous snakes in the mountains,
    Drink blood and eat people, trying to be fierce,
    Unite together to beat the beast,
    Kill the beast and have peace.
    In the West there is an America, an imperialist,
    It is more ruthless than beasts and poisonous snakes,
    Aggressing against weak nations is truly cruel,
    Political and economic oppression, layer upon layer,
    Using all kinds of conspiracies to help those reactionaries,
    Lending them money and sometimes sending big soldiers.
    In China, it hit a snag,
    The poisonous plan to help Chiang Kai-shek failed,
    Losing face completely in defeat,
    Losing both American dollars and soldiers.
    Even now it does not repent,
    Still helping Chiang Kai-shek to provoke war;
    In South Korea, it fostered Syngman Rhee,
    Undermining democracy and peace.
    Drawing a line at the 38th parallel,
    Temporarily maintaining peace and avoiding war,
    The people of South Korea are oppressed,
    Living in darkness and pain,
    Everyone gritting their teeth with hatred,
    Bearing a grudge against the American imperialist man-eater.
    A revolution began in North Korea,
    The people's leader is named Kim Il-sung,
    Carrying out land reform to eliminate feudalism,
    Farmers turning over to till the land,
    Workers running the factories as masters,
    Actively producing without slackening.
    Who would have thought that the American imperialists intended to deceive the people,
    Helping Syngman Rhee to send troops north to conquer,
    The army invading across the 38th parallel,
    He vainly wanted to sweep away the revolutionary forces.
    It is intolerable to defy heaven and reason,
    Enraging General Kim Il-sung,
    Calling on the people to defend themselves,
    To meet the enemy with a great counterattack.
    Winning victories and annihilating the bandits,
    Liberating the bandits' nest in Seoul,
    Syngman Rhee fleeing in a sorry state, unable to fight,
    Worrying the American imperialist man-eater,
    Truman issuing mad ravings within the White House,
    He wanted to send bandit soldiers to Taiwan and Korea,
    First sending planes to bomb,
    Then sending naval landing craft,
    It is truly lamentable that many people were bombed to death,
    And many houses were bombed flat,
    The Korean people gnash their teeth with hatred,
    Vowing to fight the robbers.
    After the American army landed,
    The Korean people, men and women, rushed forward in anger,
    Don't look at their good weapons and equipment,
    They are really useless in battle;
    All because their war is unjust,
    Only knowing how to enjoy themselves, not knowing how to fight, is a waste of effort,
    Especially since their army is not voluntary,
    They are all deceived by Truman's lies,
    Each one only knowing how to play guessing games,
    Either playing poker or going to the dance hall,
    Originally saying they came to Korea to enjoy themselves,
    Unexpectedly sending this group of fools into the fire pit.
    A guerrilla threw a grenade,
    Scaring the American soldiers into firing their guns and cannons non-stop,
    Firing all night until dawn,
    The guerrillas had already left without a trace.
    The People's Army advanced heroically,
    Liberating large and small villages and county towns,
    With the people cheering and singing along the roads,
    Welcoming their own soldiers,
    When the American army passed,
    The people constantly voiced their hatred,
    When will the American man-eating ghosts be driven away?
    This hatred will not be avenged, I swear I will not rest.
    The two armies opened fire in front of the battle lines,
    Instantly eliminating a large number of American soldiers,
    Some afraid of death becoming prisoners,
    Some throwing away their guns and fleeing,
    When the news reached the American White House,
    Truman was also frightened,
    Hurriedly sending generals to Japan,
    To discuss sending troops again for the second time.
    It is pitiful that his army is not large,
    Sending them to die is embarrassing,
    Kim Il-sung issued orders under the Great White Mountain,
    Calling on the people to rise up in struggle,
    Soon half a million volunteered to join the army,
    To be pioneers in defending peace.
    Don't look at North Korea having a small population and small area,
    Fighting bravely and resolutely is really something,
    Each one with soaring spirit,
    Wanting to be heroes and win glory,
    Only half a month after the counterattack,
    Eliminating 80,000 reactionary troops plus some odd soldiers,
    Aren't the remaining remnants and defeated generals waiting to die, unable to escape?
    American imperialism is like a beast,
    Struggling while wounded,
    Strong in appearance but weak in reality, a paper tiger,
    Piercing its paper skin to see clearly:
    Political corruption reaching the top,
    The broad masses of people suffering in poverty,
    Stirring up war to make trouble,
    Economic panic without prosperity,
    The beast struggling before death,
    Like the setting sun in the west leaving a residual glow.
    Look again at how consolidated our strength is,
    The world's peace camp is even stronger,
    The Soviet Union and China are so powerful,
    Democratic countries forming a great wall,
    Opposing all war instigators,
    Stalin's leadership is even more brilliant,
    The wheels of history are turning,
    Turning towards democracy and peace,
    The American imperialist thief daring to rebel,
    Guaranteed to dig his own grave.
    Seeing the beast come to bite,
    Fighting it fiercely without mercy,
    As the saying goes, "We will not attack unless we are attacked,"
    The eyes of the people of the world must recognize clearly:
    American soldiers have no fighting power,
    Originally strong in appearance but empty inside,
    The Korean People's Army is truly heroic,
    Several times eliminating American soldiers,
    All the people of Korea united like steel,
    Determined to oppose imperialism and be pioneers.
    Let us all come to aid,
    Without distinguishing north and south, east and west,
    The wind blows the sea and the waves move,
    The forces of peace are like a tide surging together,
    American imperialist! Beast! Where can you escape?
    Guaranteed to send you to your death in the tide of peace.
    We must defeat the invading robbers,
    We must stop war and defend peace!

　　打野兽
    ——为反对美帝侵略朝鲜而作
    王亚平
    野兽毒蛇在山中，
    喝血吃人想逞凶，
    合力团结打野兽，
    打死野兽得安生。
    在西方有个美国是帝国主义，
    它比野兽毒蛇更无情，
    侵略那弱小民族实残暴，
    政治、经济压迫一层又一层，
    用尽阴谋帮助那些反动派，
    借给他们金钱有时还派大兵。
    在中国它把钉子碰，
    帮助蒋匪的毒计不能成功，
    一败涂地把脸面丢了个尽，
    赔上了美金又折送了兵。
    到此时它还不改邪归正，
    还帮助蒋匪挑拨战争；
    在南朝鲜又去扶植了个李承晚，
    破坏民主与和平。
    在北纬三十八度划成一条线，
    暂时保持和平避免战争，
    南朝鲜的人民受压迫，
    黑暗痛苦难得生，
    一个个咬牙切齿恨，
    怀恨那美帝吃人精。
    朝鲜北部起革命，
    人民领袖名叫金日成，
    实行土地改革把封建消灭，
    农民翻身把地耕，
    工人当家把工厂管理，
    积极生产不放松。
    谁料想美帝存心把人民骗，
    帮助着李承晚出兵向北征，
    军队侵过三八线，
    他妄想要把革命的力量一扫平。
    伤天害理实难忍，
    激怒了将军金日成，
    号召人民来自卫，
    迎击敌人大反攻。
    旗开得胜歼贼寇，
    解放了匪帮的巢穴在汉城，
    李承晚狼狈而逃难应战，
    急坏了美帝吃人精，
    杜鲁门白宫以内发出狂言癫语，
    他要向台湾朝鲜发贼兵，
    先派飞机去轰炸，
    再派海军登陆艇，
    实可叹不少人民被炸死，
    还有那不少房屋被炸平，
    朝鲜人民切齿恨，
    誓与强盗做斗争。
    美国军队登陆后，
    朝鲜人民男男女女怒冲冲，
    别看他们武器装备的好，
    作起战来真稀松；
    都只为他们的战争非正义，
    只会享受不会作战也枉费功，
    尤其是他的军队不是自愿，
    全都是杜鲁门的谎言把他们蒙，
    一个个就知道猜拳行令，
    不是打扑克就到舞场中，
    原说是到朝鲜来享受，
    不料想把这一群傻小子送进火坑。
    游击队扔了一颗手榴弹，
    直吓得美国兵枪炮放不停，
    放了一夜天发亮，
    游击队早就走得影无踪。
    人民军英勇向前进，
    解放了大小乡村和县城，
    有人民夹道欢呼来歌唱，
    欢迎自己的子弟兵，
    美国军队开过去，
    人民不住的恨连声，
    何时赶走美国吃人鬼，
    此仇不报誓不生。
    两军阵前开了火，
    煞时间消灭了大批美国兵，
    有的怕死做俘虏，
    有的丢枪去逃生，
    消息传到美国白宫去，
    杜鲁门也吓得胆战惊，
    忙派大将到日本，
    商量二次再出兵。
    可怜他的军队并不多，
    派来送死难为情，
    金日成大白山下发号令，
    号召人民起斗争，
    不久间志愿参军就有五十万，
    保卫和平做先锋。
    别看北朝鲜人口不多地方小，
    作战英勇坚决真叫行，
    一个个气概冲天地，
    要做英雄争光荣，
    反攻才只半个月，
    消灭了反动军八万还有零，
    剩下那些残兵败将，
    还不是等着送死难逃生？
    美帝好比一野兽，
    受了创伤挣扎行，
    外强中干是个纸老虎
    戳破它的纸皮看分明：
    政治腐败透到了顶，
    广大人民受苦穷，
    挑拨战争来作祟，
    经济恐慌不繁荣，
    野兽临死强作怪，
    好比西山落日留残红。
    再看看我们的力量多巩固，
    全世界和平阵营更强盛，
    苏联与中国多么强大，
    民主国家结长城，
    反对那一切战争挑拨者，
    斯大林的领导更英明，
    历史齿轮正转动，
    转向民主与和平，
    美帝贼头敢反动，
    管叫它自己挖坑进坟茔。
    但见野兽来咬人，
    狠狠的打击不留情，
    常言道：“人不犯我我不把人犯”，
    全世界人民的眼睛要认清：
    美国兵没有战斗力，
    原来是外表强来里面空，
    朝鲜人民军真算英勇，
    几次地消灭美国兵，
    全朝鲜的人民团结成钢铁一个样，
    下决心反对帝国主义打先锋。
    咱们一齐来援助，
    不分南北和西东，
    风吹大海波浪动，
    和平力量如潮涌一般同，
    美帝呀！野兽呀！看你那里逃走？
    管叫你和平潮中送残生。
    我们要把侵略强盗打垮，
    我们要制止战争保卫和平！
