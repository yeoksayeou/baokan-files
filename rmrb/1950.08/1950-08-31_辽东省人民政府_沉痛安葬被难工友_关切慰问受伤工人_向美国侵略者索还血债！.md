The workers were very moved by the care of the government and the delegation. Worker Yu Fenghou said: "Although I was injured, Premier Zhou's statement has given me more strength. When I recover, I will definitely contribute all my strength to defend the border of the motherland."

　　辽东省人民政府
    沉痛安葬被难工友
    关切慰问受伤工人
    向美国侵略者索还血债！
    【新华社沈阳三十日电】辽东省人民政府于二十七日晚间，以万分沉痛与愤怒的心情，安葬了同日十六时四十分在安东机场被美国飞机疯狂扫射后当场被难的孙子林、王管忠、李秀国、及重伤不治的工友孙玉贵（按孙玉贵入院后卫生干部学校的女同志即自动输血三百西西，但因孙脾脏破裂，终于不治）。
    二十八日以中共辽东省委会秘书主任史屏、省人民政府民政厅长王海之等为首，组成了各界代表慰问团，前往省立医院，慰问被美机扫射受伤的工人并告慰他们：安心养伤，家里的事情，政府一定设法安置！工友们对政府和慰问团的关怀很为感动。工友于凤厚说：“我虽然受了伤，但周外长的声明却给我增加了力量，等我养好伤，一定为保卫祖国边疆贡献出自己的全部力量。”
