Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The heroic operations of the Korean People's Guerrillas have frightened the American invaders, making them extremely nervous and seeing enemies everywhere. According to a report by Carriole, a correspondent with the U.S. First Cavalry Division of the United Press, on the night of July 31, "a command post, terrified by guerrillas, fought a 'battle' for five hours, but at dawn, they discovered there were no enemies, only three dead dogs lying outside the defense line. A major, his eyes red from staying up all night, said, 'We have never used so much artillery to hit so few targets.'"

The dispatch continued: "At dawn the previous day, in an attack on the U.S. forward engineering corps command post, a squad of guerrillas killed three American soldiers and wounded seven others. On Monday evening (July 31), the guards at the engineering command post were ordered to open fire at the slightest movement. At ten o'clock, they actually opened fire. Someone on the mountain suddenly fired an automatic rifle. Within seconds, all machine guns, rifles, and carbines opened fire. ... In the command post, when the first two volleys of gunfire rang out, senior officers turned off the lights and lay down on the ground. ... Private First Class Charles Gaither said, 'We fired so many shots last night that if every shot had hit an enemy, the war would have ended today.'" Coincidentally, four enemy shells landed in the area, making the situation even more chaotic. Around three o'clock in the morning, things calmed down, and they found four American vehicles had been damaged. But how they were damaged, no one knew." (Attached picture)

　　被朝鲜游击队弄得草木皆兵
    美军“吃惊病”加重
    打了五个钟头炮才知道并无目标
    只发现有三条死狗躺在防线外面
    【新华社四日讯】在朝鲜人民游击队的英勇作战，已吓得美国侵略者惊慌万状，草木皆兵。据合众社美国第一骑兵师随军记者卡里欧尔一日报道：七月三十一日夜间，“一个被游击队弄得胆战心惊的指挥所，打了五个钟头的‘仗’，但是到天亮的时候，他们才发现并没有敌人，只发现有三条死狗躺在防线的外面。一个熬夜熬红了眼睛的少校说，‘我们从来没有用过这么多的炮火来打这样少的目标’”。
    该电继称：“在前一天的破晓，在对美国前线后边工兵队指挥所的袭击中，一班游击队打死了三个美军，还打伤了七个。到了星期一（七月三十一）晚上，这个工兵指挥所的警卫即奉命一有任何动静即行开枪。到了十点钟他们真开枪了。山上一个人突然发射自动步枪。在数秒钟之内，全部机关枪、步枪、和卡宾枪都开起火来了。……在指挥所里，当头两排枪响的时候，高级军官们关了灯伏倒在地下。…一等兵查理士·盖士里说：“昨晚我们开了那么多枪，要是每一枪都打中了一个敌人，那今天战争就已经结束了。”恰巧敌人有四个炮弹落在这一带，于是乎就变得乱上加乱。大约到早晨三点钟的时候，情形平静下来，他们发现四辆美国汽车被打坏了。但怎样被打坏的，谁也不知道。”（附图片）
