　　West German Authorities Intensify Persecution of Communists and Patriots
　　All German People Angrily Protest
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch] While openly arming West Germany, the American, British, and French occupation authorities in West Germany are further plotting to persecute German communists and all patriots. According to a Reuters dispatch, the Bonn puppet government illegally deprived German Communist Party Chairman Lehmann of his parliamentary privileges on July 29th, on the pretext that Lehmann was responsible for the arrest by the government of the German Democratic Republic of Müller, a traitor to the German Communist Party employed by imperialism, for sneaking into East Germany to engage in espionage activities. Following this, an Associated Press dispatch revealed: "The Allied High Commission" and the West German puppet government discussed the "plan to eliminate communist activities in the Western occupied areas" on July 30th. On August 1st, the US High Commissioner for Germany, McCloy, held a secret meeting with the premiers of various states in the American occupied zone to discuss the so-called "supervision of the Communist Party and its affiliated organizations." In order to suppress German patriots, the interior ministers of various West German states are scheduled to meet next week to discuss the establishment of a mobile guard force of 25,000 men.
　　These new acts of persecution by the West German occupation authorities have aroused great anger among the German people. After the news of the deprivation of Lehmann's parliamentary privileges was published, more than 4,000 people in Düsseldorf held a demonstration. Lehmann himself made a protest speech on the spot. West German people are spreading leaflets everywhere against the occupying authorities, which read: "Give Korea to the Korean people, give Germany to the German people, Americans go home!" According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch: More than 300 people in West Germany have been arrested for posting the above leaflets.
　　Millions of working people in various agencies and enterprises of the German Democratic Republic have lodged serious protests against the Lehmann incident. The protest letter passed by the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany on July 31st emphasized: "Lehmann's voice must not be silenced, because the voice of the heroic patriot Lehmann is the voice of all the German people."

　　西德当局加紧迫害共产党人及爱国者
    全德人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社五日讯】西德美、英、法占领当局在公开武装西德的同时，正进一步阴谋迫害德国共产党人以及一切爱国者。据路透社消息透露，波恩傀儡政府已于七月二十九日非法剥夺德国共产党主席雷曼的议员特权，其借口为雷曼应对受帝国主义雇用之德共叛徒穆勒因偷入东德作间谍活动被德意志民主共和国政府逮捕一事，负有责任。在此以后，合众社消息又透露：“盟国高级专署”和西德傀儡政府，于七月三十日讨论了“计划肃清西占区共产党活动”的问题。八月一日，美国驻德高级专员麦克洛埃，又曾与美占区各州总理举行秘密会议，讨论了所谓“监督共产党及其附属组织的问题”。为了镇压德意志爱国者，西德各州内政部长并已定于下周集会，讨论成立二万五千人的机动警卫部队的问题。
    西德占领当局这些新的迫害行动，已激起全德人民极大的愤怒。剥夺雷曼议员特权的消息发表后，杜塞尔多夫即有四千余人民群众举行示威。雷曼本人当场发表抗议演说。西德人民正到处传布着反对占领当局的传单，上面写着：“把朝鲜交给朝鲜人民，把德国交给德国人民，美国人回家去！”据法新社消息称：西德已有三百余人因张贴上项传单而被捕。
    德意志民主共和国各机关各企业的千万劳动人民，已对雷曼事件提出严正抗议。民主德国全国阵线全国委员会七月三十一日通过的抗议书中强调地指出：“雷曼的声音一定不能扼杀，因为英勇的爱国者雷曼的声音就是全体德国人民的声音。”
