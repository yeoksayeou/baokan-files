Jiangxi Pingxiang Xinda Well Coal Mine Suffers Water Inrush Accident
    Central Fuel Department Dispatches Investigation Team to the Site

    [This Dispatch from Pingxiang] On July 12th, a water inrush accident occurred at the state-owned Jiangxi Pingxiang Mining Bureau's Xinda Well Coal Mine. In less than ten minutes, the underground roadways were completely flooded, resulting in the drowning of nineteen fellow workers. It is currently estimated that approximately 15,000 to 16,000 tons of water have accumulated underground. The Central Fuel Department has dispatched personnel, together with the People's Supervisory Committee, to form an inspection team to investigate the site.

    Xinda Well is a newly opened project of the Pingxiang Coal Mine, with a depth of 190 meters. Construction began on April 1st, with workers working in three shifts day and night to carry out drilling operations. At 10:00 AM on July 11th, the coal seam at the Xida Xingdang head of the mine showed signs of dampness. After the middle shift workers took over, in order to speed up the work progress, they prepared to blast and drilled a 1.4-meter hole, discovering a hole as thick as a finger from which water was emerging. The on-duty worker, Qing Qizi, immediately reported this to engineer Li Enlong. Engineer Li went down the well to inspect and determined that the foul-smelling water was coal odor and would not cause an accident. At the time, some workers believed that it might be old mine water and that extra vigilance was needed. However, Engineer Li repeatedly emphasized that Xinda Well had good safety equipment, that no accidents had occurred in the past, and that accidents would not occur now. At 4:40 PM, the second group leader, Li Qingde, saw that the water flow was gradually increasing and reported this again to the engineer and the mine director, Director Feng (who was attending a meeting at the general bureau at the time). After Engineer Li arrived at the well, he announced that the project would be stopped immediately. However, he still emphasized that it did not seem like old mine water and believed it was seepage from the ventilation shaft. At 6:20 PM, Li reported the matter to the Mining Bureau General Bureau. The administrative side of the General Bureau also believed that the well had good underground equipment and that the accident would not be an emergency, so they replied by telephone: "It's dark today, we'll take a look tomorrow!" At 6:40 AM the next morning, fifty-six workers from the early shift went down the well to take over. At 7:10 AM, the Xingdang head collapsed with a rumble, and the accumulated water from the old mine burst out, with a rapid flow of 1,000 tons per minute. At that time, the workers underground desperately fled outwards. Engineering personnel issued signals four times, but the water rose extremely fiercely, and in about ten minutes, all the roadways had been submerged. Through the heroic rescue efforts of workers outside the well, a total of thirty-seven workers were rescued, and nineteen drowned.

    After the accident occurred, relevant agencies such as the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry, the Provincial Labor Bureau, the Yuanzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office, and the Pingxiang County Government all went to investigate. The Heavy Industry Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, together with the People's Supervisory Committee, jointly organized an accident investigation team, which departed on the 15th to go to the Pingxiang Coal Mine to thoroughly investigate the cause of the accident and deal with the issue of responsibility for the accident. The Pingxiang Coal Mine immediately organized a post-accident committee, offered condolences to the families of the deceased workers, and issued 100 catties of rice and 20,000 yuan in cash to each family as temporary relief funds.

    Since the Pingxiang Mine was taken over last August, large and small accidents have occurred continuously. Especially in the past month, a total of 107 accidents, large and small, have occurred. However, these serious facts have not attracted the attention of the mine's leading cadres; on the contrary, they believe that the Pingxiang Mine's safety equipment is among the best in the Central South coal mines, and therefore there is a sense of pride, complacency, and麻痹ideology. The leading cadres of the Mining Bureau are also like this. When they heard about the water seepage, they did not mobilize the workers to prevent accidents. This is the main reason for the accident. On the other hand, the lack of democracy in mine management was also exposed in this incident. Before the accident occurred, experienced veteran workers had already put forward the opinion that vigilance should be increased, but it was not taken seriously. Some workers reflected that "making suggestions is harmful, as long as there is work to do and you don't lose your job, that's enough." At the same time, the empiricism of the mine's technical personnel was also fully exposed in this accident. The well project started in 1937, and has a history of thirteen years. The construction plan after liberation was slightly modified based on the design of the American Pierce Company. However, the Pierce Company's purpose was entirely to sell surplus machinery, and the design did not take into account the geological conditions and the location of the shafts. The mine has always held a blindly optimistic view of this well project and lacked investigation. When veteran workers suspected that it was water flowing out of the old mine, the engineering personnel said "based on past experience," it was not water from the old mine. When the workers asked why the water smelled bad, they said: "The odor is the smell of coal, absolutely no problem." Ke Guizhou, a worker who escaped from the well, said: "When we in the middle shift on the 11th made suggestions, the engineer didn't even consider it. He thought the well was deep and there couldn't be an accident."

    The mine is now carrying out drainage work while conducting an in-depth investigation into the cause of the accident in order to deal with it.

### 江西萍乡新大井煤矿发生透水事故  中央燃料部派检查组前往现场调查

　　江西萍乡新大井煤矿发生透水事故
    中央燃料部派检查组前往现场调查
    【本报萍乡讯】国营江西萍乡矿务局新大井煤矿在七月十二日发生透水事故。不足十分钟，井下巷道全被淹没，淹死工友十九名。目前井下积水估计约一万五、六千吨。中央燃料部已派员会同人民监察委员会组成检查小组，前往现场检查。
    新大井为萍乡煤矿新开凿的工程，井深一百九十公尺。自四月一日开始施工，工人每天分日夜三班进行打钻工作。七月十一日上午十时，该矿西大行壋头煤层呈现潮湿。中班工友接班后，为了加速工作进程，准备放炮，打了一个一点四公尺的炮眼，发现有手指粗细的洞眼冒水。值班工人庆启自立即报告工程师李恩隆。李工程师下井检查，认为臭水是煤臭，不会发生事故。当时部分工人认为恐是老窿的水，应加倍警惕。但李工程师一再强调新大井安全设备好，过去没发生过事故，现在也不会发生事故。下午四时四十分第二组组长李清德见水流渐急，继又报告工程师及该矿凤厂长（当时凤厂长已到总局开会）李工程师来井后，宣布工程立即停止进行。但他仍强调不像老窿，认为是风井渗水所致。李于六时二十分将此事报告矿务总局，总局行政方面也认为该井一切井下设备较好，事故不会紧急发生，所以用电话答复说：“今天黑了，明天去看吧！”次日晨六时四十分早班五十六个工友下井接班。七时十分壋头轰然崩溃，老窿积水破壁而出，每分钟急流出水达一千吨。当时井下工人拼命外逃，工程人员四次发出信号，但井下水涨极凶，约十分钟，全部巷道已被淹没。经井外工人英勇抢救，共救出工人三十七名，淹死十九名。
    事故发生后，江西省工业厅、省劳动局、袁州专署、萍乡县政府等有关机关，均分别前往调查。中南军政委员会重工业部会同人民监察委员会联合组织事故检查组，于十五日出发前往萍乡煤矿彻查事故原因及处理事故责任问题。萍乡煤矿于事故发生后立即组织了善后委员会，慰问了死难工人家属，每家发米百斤，现款二万元，作为临时救济费。
    萍矿自去年八月接管后，大小事故不断发生，尤其近一月来共发生大小事故一百零七件。但这些严重事实并未引起该矿领导干部的注意；相反地，他们认为萍矿保安设备的完善在中南煤矿中是首屈一指的，因而存在骄傲自满和麻痹思想。矿务局领导干部也是如此，闻悉有冒水情况，并没有发动工友防止意外。这是发生事故的主要原因。另一方面，矿山管理的不民主，在这次事件中也暴露了出来。事故发生前，有经验的老工友早已提出应提高警惕的意见，但未被重视。部分工友反映说：“提意见就是害人，只要有活做，不失业就可以。”同时，在此次事故中也充分暴露了该矿技术人员的经验主义思想。该矿井工程在一九三七年开始，距今已有十三年历史，解放后施工计划系依据美国皮尔斯公司的设计略加修改而成。但皮尔斯公司目的全在销售过剩的机器，在设计上对地质情况及土井位置根本未加研究。该矿对此井工程一贯抱盲目乐观的看法，缺乏调查。老工友怀疑是老窿流出来的水，工程人员说“根据过去的经验”，不是老窿的水。工人问那么为什么水发臭味。他们说：“臭是煤臭，绝对没关系。”由井下逃出来的工友柯贵州说：“我们十一日中班工人提出意见时，工程师考虑也不考虑。他认为井深，不能有事故发生。”
    现该矿一面进行排水工程，一面深入调查事故原因以便处理。
