　　Welcoming the Land Reform Movement
　　East China to Train 100,000 Cadres
　　Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Other Provinces Widely Study the Land Reform Law
　　[This newspaper dispatch] According to Xinhua News Agency: In order to welcome the upcoming large-scale land reform movement, East China has already begun training cadres for land reform work. These cadres are being trained separately by the East China People's Revolutionary University, provinces, administrative regions, special districts, and counties. It is estimated that 100,000 cadres will be trained in batches before the autumn harvest. The training content varies slightly from place to place according to the different targets. The main purpose is to enable trainees to use criticism and self-criticism to summarize their work, correct certain incorrect thoughts and work styles, and learn about various policies and laws related to land reform, so as to ensure the thorough implementation of land reform policies in the future.
　　Another dispatch: Various organizations, groups, and people of all strata in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces have launched a surge of studying the Land Reform Law and promoting land reform. The people's governments at all levels and the Communist Party committees at all levels in the three provinces, various democratic parties and people's organizations, have issued instructions and notices respectively, and have made specific organizational arrangements for the study and promotion of the Land Reform Law. At present, the upsurge in studying land reform has been widely launched. Cadres, the masses, and young students in various places are in high spirits to learn, and they have purchased separate editions of the Land Reform Law one after another. As of now, bookstores in Jiangxi Province have sold 500,000 copies of the "Land Reform Law." Many villages have held forums on the Land Reform Law. Various organizations and groups in the three provinces have also organized rural work teams to go to the countryside to promote the Land Reform Law and investigate rural class relations. More than 600 people from the Propaganda Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and other units have organized work teams to go to the countryside. Jiujiang, Ganzhou and other places have also organized work teams of more than 100 people each to go to the countryside to work.

    华东将训练十万干部
    湘鄂赣等省广泛学习土地改革法
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：为着迎接即将到来的大规模的土地改革运动，华东区已经开始训练土地改革工作的干部。这些干部系由华东人民革命大学、各省、行政区、专区和各县分别训练，预计秋收以前将有十万干部分期训练完毕。训练内容各地都根据不同对象而略有不同，主要是使受训者运用批评与自我批评的方法，总结工作，纠正某些不正确的思想和作风，并学习有关土地改革的各项政策和法令，以确实保证将来土地改革政策的贯彻执行。
    又讯：湘鄂赣三省各机关团体和各阶层人民，展开了学习土地改革法和宣传土地改革的热潮。三省各级人民政府和中共各级党委，各民主党派和人民团体，均曾分别发出指示和通知，并作了学习和宣传土地改革法的具体组织工作。目前，对土地改革学习的热潮已广泛展开。各地干部、群众和青年学生等，学习情绪很高，纷纷购买土地改革法的单行本。江西省各书店截至目前为止，已售出“土地改革法”五十万册。许多村庄都召开了土地改革法的座谈会。三省各机关团体并纷纷组织农村工作队下乡宣传土地改革法和调查农村阶级关系。中共江西省委宣传部等单位已有六百余人组织工作队下乡。九江、赣州等地也各有一百余人组织工作队下乡工作。
