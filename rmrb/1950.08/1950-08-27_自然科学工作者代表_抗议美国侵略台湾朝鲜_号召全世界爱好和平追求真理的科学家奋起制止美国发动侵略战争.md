Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: The entire body of representatives at the All-China Natural Science Workers Representative Conference have issued a declaration protesting the American imperialists' aggression against Korea and Taiwan, calling on scientists around the world who love peace and pursue truth to rise up in unison to support the Korean people, stop the wars of aggression launched by American imperialism, and fight to defend lasting world peace. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

　　We, the entire body of representatives at the All-China Natural Science Workers Representative Conference, with boundless anger, protest the crimes of aggression being carried out by American imperialism in Korea, Taiwan, and other parts of Asia.

　　Since the Second World War, American imperialists have consistently engaged in conspiracies to wage wars of aggression, deploying military bases around the world, supporting anti-people puppet regimes, and restoring the reactionary forces of German and Japanese fascism, attempting to enslave the people of the world. Most recently, they have blatantly dispatched their troops, launching a criminal war on Korean soil, slaughtering the Korean people, and attempting to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan.

　　We firmly believe that the power of the people is invincible. Any aggressive delusions of the outwardly strong but inwardly weak imperialists will inevitably be shattered by the power of the people. The heroic Korean people's successive defeats of the elite divisions of the American imperialists in the past month are clear proof of this. Here, we express our highest respect to the Korean people, and call on scientists around the world who love peace and pursue truth to rise up in unison to support the Korean people, stop the wars of aggression launched by American imperialism, and fight to defend lasting world peace.

    【新华社二十五日讯】中华全国自然科学工作者代表会议全体代表顷发出抗议美帝国主义侵略朝鲜台湾宣言，号召全世界爱好和平追求真理的科学家们一致奋起，支援朝鲜人民，制止美帝国主义发动的侵略战争，为保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。宣言全文如下：
    我们中华全国自然科学工作者代表会议的全体代表，以无比的愤怒，抗议美国帝国主义目前正在朝鲜台湾以及其他亚洲地方所进行的侵略罪行。
    自从世界二次大战以后，美国帝国主义者便一贯的进行侵略战争的阴谋，在全世界各地布置军事基地，扶植反人民的傀儡政权，恢复反动的德日法西斯势力，企图奴役全世界人民。最近更明目张胆的派遣他们的军队，在朝鲜国土上发动了屠杀朝鲜人民的罪恶战争。并且妄图阻碍我们解放台湾。
    我们坚决相信人民的力量是无敌的。外强中干的帝国主义者的任何侵略妄想必然会为人民的力量所击破。英勇的朝鲜人民在过去一个多月中连续的击溃了美帝的精锐师团，便是明证。我们在此谨向朝鲜人民表示无上的敬意，并且呼吁全世界爱好和平追求真理的科学家们一致奋起支援朝鲜人民制止美帝国主义发动的侵略战争，为保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。
