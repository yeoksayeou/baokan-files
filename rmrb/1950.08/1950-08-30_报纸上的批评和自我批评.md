　　Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers
　　Several Methods Adopted by East China Newspapers to Launch Criticism and Self-Criticism
　　Regarding the launch of criticism and self-criticism in newspapers, based on the overall situation in East China newspapers, the following methods have been generally adopted: (1) Expanding the position of the social service column (or the new supplement after the merger of the social service column and the supplement), using the main space to publish manuscripts of criticism and self-criticism. (2) Holding symposiums for correspondents, reporting on issues of criticism and self-criticism, and mobilizing them to conduct criticism and self-criticism in newspapers. (3) Handling readers' criticism manuscripts, generally sending people to investigate and notifying relevant authorities, publishing the letters and investigation results or self-criticism at the same time. (4) For noteworthy criticism manuscripts, editorials are published in coordination, raising them to the level of principles, strengthening the policy and ideological nature of the criticism events, and enlightening the criticized departments and individuals to conduct in-depth self-criticism. (5) For departments and individuals whose self-criticism is incorrect or not profound enough, the editors add annotations or publish comments, adhering to principles and helping them correct their mistakes. (6) For those who openly resist and suppress criticism, resolute struggle is adopted in the newspapers; for those who ignore and delay criticism, the methods of public announcements urging, letter urging, or sending people to urge are adopted. When necessary, for the above two incorrect attitudes, the collective power of readers is organized to implement mass public opinion supervision to achieve the purpose of criticism. (7) When encountering problems that are not easy to solve, report to the leadership department and request assistance in solving them. (Jiefang Daily, August 22)
　　Two Erroneous Ideas Regarding Launching Criticism in Newspapers
　　Ningxia Daily wrote in its editorial "Further Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism": "Recently, it has been found that individual units and organs have serious erroneous ideas of 'reporting good news but not bad news' and 'reporting good things but not bad things.' When reporters praise their achievements, they are very happy, actively provide materials, and give great convenience; when reporters criticize their shortcomings, they refuse to talk about it and create great obstacles. In addition, some comrades believe that errors and shortcomings can only be reported after they have been corrected, and the manuscript will then have guiding significance. In fact, this is a distorted obstruction of criticism. The reason why these people demand 'results' and 'completeness' is that they are afraid of losing 'face' among the masses. If there is a 'result,' then 'you see, I have already dealt with it,' which seems more glorious." (Ningxia Daily, August 10)
　　Two Kinds of Reactions from the Masses to Criticism in Newspapers
　　The reader's letter group of Southern Daily mentioned the readers' reactions to criticism in its July work report. The report cited an example: After we published criticism of the Shunde Third District Government on June 26, the masses in the district had two different reactions. One was that they felt that the newspaper "exposed" this matter and were very surprised. They believed that Southern Daily was the Communist Party, and the district government was not the Communist Party, and that the person who submitted the letter must have a relationship with Southern Daily and was a "high official"; others felt very happy, thinking that the criticized person was "bad to the core." From here, it can be seen that we still have to better, more correctly, and more frequently carry out the work of criticism and self-criticism so that the masses can understand the effectiveness of this weapon. It is necessary to correct the people's biases in understanding this issue, only by frequently launching criticism and self-criticism, and at the same time distinguishing those fundamentally illegal and destructive counter-revolutionary activities, can the people distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. If the mistakes made by the revolutionary regime are not distinguished from the counter-revolutionary activities carried out under the guise of the revolutionary regime; if the shortcomings in style and thought are criticized in the same way as various serious criminal acts, this is confusing the enemy and ourselves, and objectively it is adding all the counter-revolutionary conspiracies and sabotage activities to the Party and the People's Government. (Southern Daily, August 16)

　　报纸上的批评和自我批评
    华东各报展开批评和自我批评采用的几种方法
    对于报纸上展开批评和自我批评，综合华东各报情况，大体上采取了如下几种方法：（１）扩大社会服务栏（或社会服务栏与副刊合并后的新副刊）的地位，以主要篇幅登载批评和自我批评的稿件。（２）召开通讯员座谈会，报告批评和自我批评问题，并动员在报上进行批评和自我批评。（３）处理读者的批评稿件，一般是派人调查，并通知有关机关，把来信和调查结果或检讨同时刊登。（４）值得重视的批评稿件，配合都发表言论，提到原则高度，加强批评事件的政策性和思想性，并启发被批评的部门和个人进行深刻检讨。（５）对于检讨不正确或不深刻的部门和个人，编者加按语，或者发表评论，坚持原则，帮助其纠正错误。（６）对待公开抗拒压制批评的，采取在报上坚决斗争办法；对被批评者不理不睬，拖延批评的，采用公开登报催促，写信催促，或派人催促办法。对以上两种不正确的态度，必要时并组织读者集体力量，实行群众舆论监督，以达到批评的目的。（７）遇有不易解决的问题，报告领导部门，要求协助解决。（解放日报八月二十二日）
  对在报纸上展开批评的两种错误思想
    宁夏日报在《进一步展开批评和自我批评》的社论中写道：“近来发现有个别单位和机关，存在着严重的‘报喜不报忧’‘报好不报坏’的错误思想，记者表扬他们的成绩时，非常高兴，主动供给材料，给以很大的方便；当记者批评他们的缺点时，则拒绝不谈，予以很大的阻难。另外，还有一些同学认为错误和缺点只有在作了纠正后才能报道，稿件才有指导意义。其实，这是一种变态的阻挠批评。这些人他们之所以要求有‘结果’和‘完整’，是怕自己在群众中失掉‘面子’，如果有个‘结果’，那末‘你看我已经处理了’，就好像比较光彩一些。”（宁夏日报八月十日）
  群众对报纸上进行批评的两种反映
    南方日报读者来信组七月份工作报告中，提到读者对批评的反响。报告中举例说：我们在六月二十六日发表对顺德三区政府的批评后，该区群众就有二种不同的反响，一是觉得报纸“揭发”了这事，很惊奇。认为南方日报才是共产党，区政府不是共产党，那投函人，一定与南方日报有关系，而且是“大官”；另外有一些人觉得很高兴，认为被批评的人“坏透了”。从这里，可见我们还得更好地更正确地和更经常的展开批评和自我批评的工作，使群众能明白这一武器的效用。要端正人民中对这问题认识上的偏向，只有经常的展开批评和自我批评，同时把那些根本上属于犯法的、破坏性的反革命的活动加以区别，才能使人民分清敌我。如果把革命政权犯的错误和带着革命政权假面具而进行的反革命活动不加区别；对于作风上思想上的缺点和对于各种严重的犯罪行为同样地都是批评，这就是混淆了敌我，客观上是把一切反革命的阴谋破坏活动都加在党和人民政府的身上。（南方日报八月十六日）
