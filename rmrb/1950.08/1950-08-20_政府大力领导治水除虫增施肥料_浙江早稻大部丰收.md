　　Government Strongly Leads Water Management, Pest Control, and Increased Fertilizer Application
    Zhejiang's Early Rice Harvest is Largely Successful
    [Our Newspaper's Comprehensive Report] Zhejiang Province celebrates a bumper early rice harvest. Thanks to the active leadership of local people's governments in guiding farmers in water management, pest control, meticulous farming, and favorable weather conditions, the early rice crop generally grew well this year. The province's early rice is now generally ripe and being harvested, with most areas having completed the harvest. Except for some areas where yields were partially reduced due to waterlogging or drought, most areas achieved a bumper harvest, generally increasing production by 10% to 20% compared to previous years.
    In Jiaxing Prefecture's Deqing, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Chongde and other counties, the 60-day early rice harvest began at the end of July and is now basically completed; the 80-day early rice will also be harvested in a few days. Yields generally increased by more than 20% compared to previous years; some areas saw increases of 30% to 40%, with Jiaxing having the highest yield, with some areas reaching 533 catties of rice per mu. In Ningbo Prefecture's Yuyao, Yinxian, Cixi, Zhenhai and other counties, early rice generally increased by 10% to 20%. In Yuyao County, areas yielding 350 catties per mu accounted for 30% to 40%, with general yields around 250 catties, and the highest yielding areas, such as Simen District, reached 420 catties per mu. In Jinhua Prefecture, the 60-day early rice harvest has been completed in all counties, with yields generally increasing by 15% to 20% compared to previous years. According to experienced old farmers in Jinhua County, the mid-season rice this year will be better than the early and late seasons, and it is expected that the mid-season rice will produce even higher yields than the early rice when it matures. Early rice production also increased substantially in Shaoxing Prefecture. For example, in Sheng County, the average yield was 200 catties per mu in previous years, but this year the best yields reached 330 catties per mu, and even the poorer yields were around 250 catties. In Wushu Village, Yaojiang District, Zhuji County, the entire village's 500 mu of early rice (150 mu more than in previous years) yielded an average of over 350 catties per mu, doubling the yield compared to last year and increasing by about 20% compared to normal years; the grains were also fuller than in previous years. In Hang County (directly under Hangzhou Municipality), the average early rice yield was over 300 catties per mu, also increasing by 20% compared to previous years. Many areas in the province have promptly sown late autumn crops after the early rice harvest. Wantan Cooperative Village in Lanxi put forward the slogan "No empty fields after the autumn harvest," and has now planted good corn; the masses are also saving grain to prepare to go to the city to purchase fertilizer. Henanli Natural Village, the twelfth village of Bujiapeng Township in Shouchang, put forward the slogan "Harvesting on one hand, cultivating on the other." Most of the village has harvested the early rice and planted corn, soybeans and other crops.
    The main reasons for the general increase in early rice production this year are: First, under the leadership of the People's Government, farmers throughout the province have generally built water conservancy projects to prevent floods and droughts, and this year's rainfall has been even, with sufficient water stored in lakes and ponds, allowing the rice fields to be fully irrigated. For example, Hang County successively built 2,496 water conservancy projects this spring, benefiting a total area of 190,000 mu, accounting for half of the county's paddy fields. Among them, the new Wu Pu sluice gate, the dredging of the Tanghe estuary, and the rush repair of the West Xian Da Tang and other 16 large projects were all funded or loaned by the government, totaling 629,646 catties of rice. Second, the People's Government strongly led pest control efforts, reducing pest damage. Two large-scale pest control campaigns were launched in various places, and Hang County mobilized and organized 250,000 men and women to carry out pest control day and night. At night, more than 50,000 lanterns shone in the rice fields throughout the county. A total of 17.91 million rice stem borer moths, 3.5 million rice stem borer egg masses, and 19.78 million rice stem borer larvae, mole crickets, rice stink bugs and other pests, plus 14,000 catties of these pests, were killed, alleviating the serious pest damage. Third, the government, through trade companies and cooperatives, helped farmers transport and sell local and special products (tea, fruit, silk, cocoons, etc.). Hang County alone purchased 15,373 dan of spring cocoons (the ratio of improved varieties to local varieties was about two to one), with a total value of over 7 billion yuan. This not only helped farmers successfully survive the spring famine, but also increased their production capital, enabling them to afford to apply more fertilizer; the Zhejiang branch of the People's Bank also used a huge sum of money worth 16 million catties of rice to purchase fertilizer and lend it to farmers for application; in addition, free lending was launched in various places to solve the fertilizer shortage difficulties of some farmers, so the amount of fertilizer applied by farmers in various places increased compared to previous years. Fourth, after the liberation of the province, after struggles such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, abolishing the Baojia system, rationally sharing burdens, and reducing rent and interest in the countryside, and a series of democratic reforms, farmers were politically liberated and their economy was partially improved, so their production enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high, and they generally paid attention to meticulous farming and fertilizer accumulation. The amount of river mud, lime and other fertilizers accumulated in Jiaxing and Shaoxing prefectures increased by 20% compared to previous years. Lu Jian, a farmer in Wubao Village, Zhuji County, applied more than 50 small boats of river mud to his 1.8 mu of land, and harvested more than 900 catties of early rice, about 500 catties per mu. In terms of meticulous farming, all localities generally achieved earlier cultivation; they plowed and weeded one or two more times than in previous years.

　　政府大力领导治水除虫增施肥料
    浙江早稻大部丰收
    【本报综合讯】浙江全省早稻喜庆丰收。由于各地人民政府积极领导农民治水、除虫、精耕细作，加以雨水调和，今年早稻一般成长良好。现该省早稻已普遍成熟收割，大部地区并已收割完毕。早稻收成除个别地区因受水旱影响部分减产外，大部地区普获丰收，一般较往年增产一成至二成。
    嘉兴专区的德清、嘉兴、嘉善、崇德等县，六十日早稻自七月底开始收割，目前已基本收割完毕；八十日早稻再过几天亦将收割。产量一般比往年增产二成以上；个别地区有增产三成至四成的，其中以嘉兴产量为最高，有的每亩收到五百三十三斤稻谷。宁波专区余姚、鄞县、慈溪、镇海等县，早稻普遍增产一、二成。余姚县每亩产三百五十斤的占百分之三十至四十，一般收成均在二百五十斤上下，最多者如泗门区，每亩有的收到四百二十斤。金华专区各县六十日早稻已收割完毕，普遍比往年增产一成半至两成。据金华县有经验的老农反映，今年的中季稻要比早、晚两季收成为好，预计中季稻成熟后，将比早稻产量更大。绍兴专区早稻亦大部增产。如嵊县往年每亩平均产二百斤，今年每亩最好的达三百三十斤，差一点的也有二百五十斤左右。诸暨姚江区吴墅村全村五百亩早稻（较往年多种一百五十亩），平均每亩收三百五十余斤，比去年增产一倍，比常年增产两成左右；谷粒亦较往年饱满。杭县（直属杭州市）早稻每亩平均产三百斤以上，亦较往年增产二成。该省不少地区于早稻收完后，及时播种晚秋。兰溪万坛合作村，提出“秋收无空田”的口号，现已种好六谷（即玉蜀黍）；群众并省下粮食准备上城购肥。寿昌卜家蓬乡十二村河南里自然村提出“一面收割、一面耕种”的口号。全村大部已收好早稻，种上六谷、青豆等作物。
    今年早稻普遍增产的主要原因：一、在人民政府领导下，全省农民普遍兴修水利，防洪防旱，且今年雨水调匀，湖、塘蓄水充足，稻田能充分灌水。如杭县今春陆续兴修水利工程二千四百九十六处，受益面积总计十九万亩，占全县水田半数。其中新筑五浦水闸，疏浚塘河口道，抢修西险大塘等十六处较大工程，均由政府出资或贷款举办，共计大米六十二万九千六百四十六斤。二、人民政府大力领导治虫，减少了虫害。各地普遍发动了两次较大规模的治虫运动，杭县一县两次共发动和组织了二十五万男女群众进行除虫，昼夜不停，夜间全县有五万余盏灯笼闪烁在稻田里。共计捕杀螟蛾一千七百九十一万只，螟卵三百五十万块，螟幼虫、地蚕、稻椿象等一千九百七十八万条又一万四千斤，使严重的虫害为之减轻。三、政府通过贸易公司和合作社，帮助农民运销和收购土产及特产（茶、水果、丝、茧等），杭县仅仅春茧一项即收购一万五千三百七十三担（良种与土种约为二与一之比），总值七十亿元以上。这不仅扶助农民胜利度过春荒，而且增加了农民的生产资本，使农民具备了增施肥料的经济条件；人民银行浙江分行并以价值一千六百万斤大米的巨款收购肥料，贷给农民施用；另外各地并发动自由借贷，解决了部分农民缺肥困难，因此各地农民施肥量都比往年增加。四、全省解放后，农村中经过剿匪、反霸、废除保甲、合理负担、减租减息等斗争和一系列的民主改革，农民在政治上获得解放，经济上也得到部分改善，生产情绪因而空前高涨，普遍注意了精耕细作和积肥。嘉兴、绍兴两专区所积河泥、石灰等肥料，较往年增加百分之二十。诸暨县吴堡村卢纪安一亩八分田，上了五十多小船河泥，早稻收获九百余斤，一亩地收五百斤左右。在精耕细作方面，各地一般都做到提早耕作；比往年多耕、多耘一遍到两遍。（叶遐修、董焕然、杨少、叶润桐、陈石滢、浙江日报）
