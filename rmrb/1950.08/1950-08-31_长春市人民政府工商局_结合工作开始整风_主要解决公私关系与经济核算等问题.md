　　Changchun Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce
    Begins Rectification Combined with Work
    Mainly to Resolve Issues such as Public-Private Relations and Economic Accounting
    [Our Newspaper] The Changchun Municipal People's Government Bureau of Industry and Commerce has begun a rectification campaign in conjunction with its current key tasks. Before the start of the rectification, the bureau convened a meeting on August 2nd for cadres at the level of section chief and above, including members of the Grain, General Merchandise, Native Produce, Coal and Construction, and Trust Companies, as well as affiliated factories and the bureau itself, to mobilize and deploy the rectification.
    The basic content of the bureau's rectification is mainly to review and resolve: the leading ideology and specific work issues in the implementation of the comprehensive policy on public-private relations, the implementation of various resolutions and the responsibility system, the issue of economic accounting after the determination of funds, and the relationship between state-owned commerce and various economic components. The rectification steps are set to initially complete the inspection of the above issues from August 12th to 28th, and participate in the commercial professional conference for rectification after August 28th. The method is mainly to combine leadership with the masses, focusing on inspecting the work of the leadership, with Party member cadres above the section chief level participating in the rectification study. In order to make this rectification more complete and substantial, it is planned to convene a work inspection meeting combining general Party members and the masses, centered around the core content of the rectification, in addition to the rectification study. Secondly, when rectifying a certain issue, relevant rectification documents will be read, and past work will be reviewed based on the spirit of the documents and the Party's policies. In the inspection work, good experiences will be affirmed and upheld, and shortcomings and errors will be exposed, and suggestions for improvement will be put forward. After summarization, improvements will be made quickly based on the summary. The leadership of the rectification is personally controlled by the administrative head, with the branch cooperating and ensuring its progress. Meetings are held during morning and evening study time, generally not occupying work time. During the rectification period, all work continues as usual.
    Through this rectification, the city's industrial and commercial management and state-owned trade work will better implement the Party's basic policies and improve the work. (Changchun Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce)
