Xinhua News Agency, August 9th: A Warsaw dispatch from the Polish News Agency on the 7th reported: A Warsaw newspaper commented on the speech of the Soviet representative Malik at the Security Council, stating: The situation is clear and obvious. The imperialists are talking about "localizing the conflict," but are striving to intensify and expand it. The Soviet Union demands that the Security Council restore its prestige and effectiveness, and specifically points out how the conflict can be stopped. The imperialists say they are against "aggression," but they themselves are engaging in brutal aggression (which, from the facts and international law, is undeniably aggression), and are inhumanely slaughtering Korean women and children. The newspaper stated: If the imperialists think they can cover up a situation that is clear to the people of all countries, they are wrong in their estimates, just as their generals in Korea have already been wrong.
    The People's Tribune expressed its firm belief that although the Americans may succeed in instigating certain representatives of the Security Council to support aggression, they will certainly not receive the support of the people. The people are against aggression and against the aggressors. The people demand a peaceful solution to the Korean issue based on the Soviet proposal. The people believe that all those who are armed and interfering in the internal affairs of Korea are enemies of peace, whether they are interfering under the Stars and Stripes or under the stolen United Nations flag.

　　苏联努力恢复安理会威信
    美国却加紧扩大侵略战争
    波报评马立克在安理会的演说
    【新华社九日讯】波兰通讯社华沙七日讯：华沙报评论苏联代表马立克在安理会的演讲称：情况是清楚明白的。帝国主义者正在高谈“冲突局部化”，但却在竭力加剧和扩大这个冲突。苏联要求安理会恢复其威信与行动的效力，并具体指出冲突如何才能停止。帝国主义者说：他们反对“侵略”，但自己却正在从事残酷的侵略（从事实与国际法看来，都无可争辩的是侵略），并且正在毫无人性地屠杀朝鲜的妇女与儿童。该报称：如果帝国主义者认为他们将能掩盖一个在各国人民眼里清清楚楚的情况，他们的估计就错了，正如他们的将军们在朝鲜的估计已经错了一样。
    人民论坛报表示坚信：虽然美国人可能成功地怂恿安理会的某些代表支持侵略，但他们却一定得不到人民的支持。人民是反对侵略、反对侵略者的。人民要求根据苏联的建议和平地解决朝鲜问题。人民认为一切正在武装干涉朝鲜内政的人都是和平的敌人，不论他们是在星条旗下或者还是在偷来的联合国旗帜下进行干涉，都是一样。
