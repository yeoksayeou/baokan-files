Northeast China People’s Gatherings
    Resolve to Oppose Aggression with Practical Actions

    [By Our Newspaper] The movement of the people of Northeast China against American imperialism's aggression in Taiwan and Korea is continuing to develop. Workers and staff in various places have expressed their determination to oppose aggression with practical actions to complete production tasks.
    
    Shenyang City

    The Cultural and Educational Department of the Shenyang City Mechanical Workers' Union began on July 17th to call on all branches to launch activities for a week of anti-American aggression against Taiwan and Korea. On July 18th, Machine Factory No. 3 used loudspeakers to give current affairs reports, enabling all workers to more deeply understand the American imperialists' aggressive conspiracy. The workers also organized themselves to read and discuss relevant materials in the newspaper. On the 21st, the factory's trade union held a forum against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea, attended by more than 100 workers from various departments of the factory. Labor hero Zhao Guoyou, veteran worker Lü Hao, milling worker Yan Yingchen, lathe worker Kang Motian, fitter Ren Binggong, technician Zhang Defa, women's committee member Wang Zhongying, and youth league member apprentice Gu Wenhai all spoke, unanimously expressing their determination to strengthen unity between workers and technicians, improve production, and support the Korean people. On the evening of July 18th, the Cultural and Educational Department of the trade union held a mass meeting of more than 1,700 people at the Tiexi District Club. First, the Tiexi District Committee made a report, followed by free speeches, with labor hero Zhao Guoyou and other workers speaking enthusiastically. Workers from the Shenyang Chengfa Iron Factory held a discussion, in which they unanimously agreed that: in order to solve its economic crisis, American imperialism wants to provoke a war to save itself from extinction. However, with the growing strength of the peace and democracy camp, the imperialists' aggressive acts will be completely crushed. Workers Han Decai, Liu Weizhen, and Wang Shanxin all used concrete facts to illustrate this point.
