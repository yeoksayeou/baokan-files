Chinese Youth and Students Actively Defend Peace
This Journal's Comprehensive Report

    Youth and students across China are heroic fighters in the signature campaign to defend world peace. They not only enthusiastically signed the Stockholm Appeal but also played a significant role in promoting this great movement.

    On May 15th, the All-China Students' Federation, together with the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the All-China Youth Federation, jointly issued a notice calling on young people and students nationwide to actively participate in the peace signature campaign. This was to demonstrate the determination and strength of Chinese youth in opposing war and defending peace, and to enhance young people and students' understanding of patriotism and internationalism. This notice immediately received enthusiastic responses from students across the country, and a signature upsurge quickly spread to schools in cities and villages.

    All 4,552 students and staff of the Renmin University of China signed the peace declaration. Students also created huge Stockholm Appeal posters and propaganda paintings to display at the school gate, and hundreds of blackboards within the school were filled with the solemn peace declaration. Some students solemnly copied the peace declaration onto the first page of their diaries, expressing their loyalty and will to defend world peace.

    The enthusiasm of students in schools across the country for defending world peace was equally high. In schools where the peace signature campaign had already started, almost 90% to 95% of the students participated, and many schools achieved full participation. For example, all 781 teachers and students of Xinji Middle School in Hebei Province signed the peace declaration; after studying and discussing "Why Participate in the Peace Signature Campaign," all 128 teachers, students, and staff of Gaocun Complete Primary School in Longyao County signed their names...

    In addition to signing the peace declaration, many students wrote about their will to defend world peace and oppose aggression. Jin Cuiying, representing all the female students of Jilin City No. 1 Middle School, swore: "We resolutely defend world peace and oppose American imperialist aggression. If the American imperialists dare to provoke a new war of aggression, we will learn from the Soviet heroine Zoya Kosmodemyanskaya and dedicate ourselves to defending the motherland." Male students swore to participate in the fight against aggression and to defend the motherland like the Soviet youth hero Alexander Matrosov. Students of the Wuhan Military Cadre Children's School said when signing: "We demand a peaceful environment to study, inherit our parents' revolutionary cause in the future, build a new China, and defend world peace."

    Youth and students in various regions spared no effort in promoting the peace signature campaign, enabling this movement to spread widely among the masses. The teachers, students, and staff of Zhengding Middle School in Hebei Province wrote in the peace book: "We will express our determination to resolutely defend peace and oppose wars of aggression through practical actions of publicizing to the people."

    At the beginning, many schools' students often used their spare time and holidays to mobilize their families, relatives, friends, and neighbors to participate in the signature campaign. For example, students of Jiangsu Provincial Songjiang Girls' Middle School launched a "one person, five people movement" to commemorate July 7th, and overfulfilled the task in one day, mobilizing 1,013 people to sign. Starting from such a promotional approach, they further organized themselves to launch various forms of publicity to defend world peace to the masses.

    In the large-scale, organized mass publicity campaigns in cities across the country, Chinese youth and students demonstrated great momentum.

    The Beijing Students' Federation organized a publicity team of more than 1,200 students from more than 30 universities and colleges, including Renmin University of China, Peking University, Sino-French University, and Normal University, divided into eight detachments, to conduct publicity for defending world peace in the urban and suburban areas of the capital from July 20th. One publicity team from Normal University had a record of mobilizing 117 people to sign in one hour. Students from other schools in the capital also organized publicity teams to carry out publicity work in conjunction with waist drums and yangko dances. For example, students from Municipal No. 8 Middle School used their spare time to organize a publicity team of more than 500 people, divided into groups to publicize to residents in Tianqiao, Xuanwumen, and other areas, mobilizing 24,574 people to sign in two days. For example, the National Hui Nationality College specifically publicized the significance of the peace signature campaign in areas where the Hui people gathered, which received considerable results.

    Three hundred students from the Literature and Art College of Zhongyuan University in Wuchang crossed the Yangtze River to Hankou and engaged in peace publicity with flower drum tunes at the dock, which was very popular with the dock workers. Later, they expanded their publicity in the city, collecting more than 20,000 signatures in one day. Students from various schools in Shanghai generally organized publicity groups to go deep into the neighborhoods to carry out publicity, promoting the peace signature campaign to the unorganized masses. Students in the Beibei District of Chongqing, in cooperation with workers, organized 104 publicity teams and 186 visiting teams to carry out publicity separately, mobilizing a large number of citizens to sign. Students of Juxing Town Primary School in Haimen County, Northern Jiangsu, used a door-to-door publicity method to mobilize 749 people in the town to sign. Many schools' students also drew publicity leaflets, printed peace declarations, or compiled and performed dramas to increase the effect of publicity.

    Students are dedicated to the cause of defending peace and do not fear hardship. Students in Nanzhang, Hubei, continued to publicize to the people in the pouring rain. Their dedication moved many people to participate in the signature campaign. When students in Shanghai went deep into visiting scattered residents, they helped them wash vegetables and hold their children, explaining the meaning of peace signature while doing so.

    Youth and students have made great contributions to extending the peace signature campaign from large cities to the vast countryside. Many schools' students have gone deep into the countryside to carry out publicity, explaining the significance of peace signature to the masses, and mobilizing them to participate in the signature campaign. For example, more than 40 students from the China Youth Art Theater who participated in the wheat harvest experience in Ranzhuang Village, Baoding, Hebei, formed six publicity work teams, in cooperation with the village cadres, to carry out peace publicity to the peasants, mobilizing more than 2,100 of the 2,200 people in the village to sign. Students of Beipo Primary School in the Ninth District of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, cooperated with the local Communist Youth League branch to mobilize all villagers to sign. More than 6,000 students from sixteen primary schools in the Taixi District of Qingdao, under the leadership of the Communist Youth League branch, cooperated with the school administrative staff and teachers to carry out publicity work, mobilizing more than 50,000 farmers in the whole district to sign the peace declaration.

    When they carry out peace publicity in the countryside, they either use the opportunity of temple fairs and market days, or take advantage of the time when the villagers are resting at noon or cooling off, or beat drums and gongs, or chat casually, patiently explaining the significance of the peace signature campaign to them. Some also combine this with the movement against American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, conducting international current affairs education, striving to make the villagers understand "why they are signing," and then let them or write their names on the peace declaration on their behalf. For example, after the masses of Luzhuang Village, Tangjiahe District, Leting County, Hebei Province, were publicized by local students, they had a better understanding of the signature campaign. Chen Junwu, a 62-year-old military family member, said: "Earlier, I thought that signing my name was useless and couldn't replace cannons. After these children explained it, I realized that signing a name is worth a cannon, so let's sign quickly!" In two days, 507 people in the village signed their names.

    In the vast ranks of young students and peace fighters, there are many outstanding activists who have done their best for the peace signature campaign. For example, Xie Yonglu, a student of Fenglin Primary School in Linxia City, Gansu Province, went to publicize everywhere after dinner every night and mobilized more than 400 people to sign in three days. A group composed of Mai Jianping and other students of Shixing Primary School in Guangzhou mobilized more than 700 residents to sign in one day. Zhang Yuhuang, a student of Tunliu Middle School in Shanxi Province, went home to fetch rice and flour, and did not miss the opportunity to publicize the significance of the peace signature campaign to the villagers along the way. He also carried out publicity in his village and mobilized a total of 118 people to sign. Also, a student from Jingwen Girls' Middle School in Shanghai accompanied a passerby for two miles, publicizing the peace signature to him, and finally moved him to sign the peace declaration. Such facts are countless.

    On August 13th, in response to the call of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace to strive to complete the peace signature of 150 million to 200 million people nationwide, the All-China Students' Federation, together with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Democratic Youth Federation, and the All-China Women's Federation, jointly issued a notice calling for continued vigorous development of the peace signature campaign. This call has been enthusiastically responded to by students across the country. Chinese youth and students will continue to exert their greatest strength for the world peace movement.

　　中国青年学生积极保卫和平
    本刊综合报道
    中国各地的青年学生是保卫世界和平签名运动的英勇斗士，他们不但在斯德哥尔摩宣言上踊跃地签了名，而且在这一伟大运动的宣传工作上发挥着极大的推动力量。
    五月十五日，全国学联曾与团中央、全国青联共同发出通知，号召全国青年和学生热烈参加和平签名运动，以表示中国青年反对战争、保卫和平的决心和力量，并在这一运动中提高青年学生对于爱国主义和国际主义的认识。这一通知立刻获得各地学生的热烈响应，签名热潮迅速推进到各城市和乡村的学校中去。
    中国人民大学全体学生员工四千五百五十二人全部在和平宣言上签了名。同学们并绘制了巨幅的斯德哥尔摩宣言和宣传画张贴在学校门口，校内成百的黑板报上都抄上庄严的和平宣言。有些同学把和平宣言庄重地抄录在日记本的首页上，表示出他们对保卫世界和平的忠心和意志。
    各地学校的同学们对保卫世界和平的热诚也同样的高涨，凡是已经展开和平签名运动的学校，参加签名的差不多都在全校同学人数百分之九十至九十五以上，而且许多学校是全体签名。例如河北省的辛集中学七百八十一名师生全部在和平宣言上签名；隆尧县县立高村完小，学习讨论了“为什么参加和平签名运动”后，全校师生工友一百二十八名都签了名……
    许多学生除了在和平宣言上签名外，并写出他们保卫世界和平、反对侵略的意志。吉林市一中的金翠英代表全校女同学宣誓说：“我们坚决保卫世界和平，反对美帝侵略，如果美帝真敢挑起新的侵略战争，我们将学习苏联女英雄丹娘一样献身保卫祖国。”男同学则宣誓要像苏联青年英雄马特洛索夫一样参加反对侵略、保卫祖国的战斗。武汉军人干部子弟学校的学生们签名时说：“我们要求和平的环境学习，将来继承父母的革命事业，建设新中国，保卫世界和平。”
    各地的青年学生们对于和平签名运动的宣传推动工作，也不遗余力，使这一运动在人民大众中间得以广泛地展开。河北省正定中学全体师生员工在和平书上写道：“我们要以向老百姓宣传的实际行动来表示我们坚决保卫和平反对侵略战争的意志。”
    许多学校的学生在开始时候往往利用他们课余和例假的时间，发动他们的家人、戚友和邻居参加签名，例如江苏省立松江女中的同学，发动“一人五人运动”来纪念七七，一天之内就超额完成任务，发动了一千零十三人签名。从这样的推动方式开始，他们进一步组织起来，向广大群众发动多种多样的保卫世界和平的宣传。
    在全国各城市的大规模有组织的群众宣传运动中间，中国青年学生们表现了极大的推动力量。
    北京市学联组织了中国人民大学、北大、中法、师大等三十余个大中学校一千二百多名学生的宣传队，分成八个大队，自七月二十日起分别在首都市区和郊区进行保卫世界和平的宣传。师大一个宣传队有过一小时发动一一七人签名的纪录。首都其他学校的学生也分别组织宣传队，以腰鼓、秧歌配合进行宣传工作，如市立八中的同学利用课余时间，组织五百多人的宣传队，分组到天桥、宣武门一带向居民进行宣传，两天内发动了二万四千五百七十四人签名。又如国立回民学院专向回民聚集的区域宣传和平签名运动意义，收到相当效果。
    武昌的中原大学文艺学院三百名同学渡江到汉口，在码头以花鼓小调从事和平宣传，大受码头工人欢迎，后来再到市内展开宣传，一天之内征集了二万余人的签名。上海市各学校的学生，则普遍组织宣传小组，深入里弄进行宣传，将和平签名运动推动到无组织的群众中去。重庆北碚区的学生，与工人配合，组织了一百零四个宣传队，一百八十六个访问队，分头进行宣传，发动了广大的市民签名。苏北海门县立聚星镇小学的同学们以挨门逐户进行宣传方式，发动镇上七百四十九人签名。许多学校同学并且绘制宣传单，印发和平宣言，或编演话剧，来增加宣传的效果。
    同学们献身保卫和平运动是不辞劳苦的，湖北南漳的学生在大雨滂沱中，仍不断向老百姓进行宣传，他们的工作热诚感动了不少群众参加签名。上海的同学在深入访问分散居民的时候，就帮助他们洗菜、抱小孩，一面做，一面和他们解说和平签名的意义。
    青年学生对于把和平签名运动从大城市推展到广大农村是作了很大的贡献的，许多学校的学生都纷纷深入农村进行宣传，向群众解释和平签名的意义，发动他们参加签名。例如在河北保定冉庄村参加麦收体验农村生活的四十多名中国青年艺术剧院学生，组成六个宣传工作队，配合该村的村干部，向农民们展开和平宣传，发动了该村二千二百余人中的二千一百余人签名。河北省邢台县九区北坡小学学生与该村青年团支部配合宣传，动员了全村村民签名。青岛台西区十六个小学的六千多学生在青年团支部领导下，配合学校行政工作人员和教师，进行宣传工作，动员了全区五万以上的农民在和平宣言上签了名。
    他们在农村中进行和平宣传，或者是利用庙会与赶集的机会，或者趁着老乡们晌午、歇凉等时机，或敲锣打鼓，或随便闲谈，耐心地向他们解说和平签名运动的意义，有些并且结合着反对美帝侵略台湾朝鲜运动，进行国际时事的教育，务求使老乡们明白了“为啥签名”，再让他们或代他们在和平宣言上写下名字。例如河北省乐亭县汤家河区陆庄村的群众经过当地学生宣传后，对签名运动才有了认识，六十二岁的军属陈峻武说：“早先，我以为签个名没啥用，又顶不了大炮使，经这些孩子们一说，才知道了签个名顶一架大炮，赶快签名吧！”两天的工夫全村就有五百零七个群众签了名。
    在广大的青年学生和平战士的队伍中，更有不少成绩优异的积极分子，他们为和平签名运动尽了他们最大的力量。例如甘肃临夏市凤林小学学生谢永禄，每天晚饭后到各处宣传，三天内发动了四百余人签名。广州始兴小学学生麦建平等组成的一个小组，一天就动员了七百多居民签名。山西屯留中学学生张毓荒回家取米面，沿途也不放过向老乡宣传和平签名运动意义的机会，回到本村也同样进行宣传，结果一共发动了一百一十八人签名。又上海静文女中的一个同学，陪着一个路人走了两里路，向他宣传和平签名，终于感动了他，在和平宣言上签了名。这样的事实是数不胜数的。
    八月十三日，全国学联为响应中国保卫世界和平大会委员会争取全国完成一万万五千万至两万万人民的和平签名的号召，特与全国总工会、团中央、民主青联、全国妇联等团体共同发出通知，号召继续大力开展和平签名运动。这一号召已获得全国各地学生的热烈响应，中国的青年学生将为保卫世界和平运动继续发挥他们最大的力量。
