(Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 6th) The Central South region will implement land reform this winter in areas with approximately 50 million agricultural population, including half of Henan Province (the other half completed land reform this spring) and most or part of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces. Between this winter and next spring, these areas will, in accordance with the provisions of the "Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China," abolish the feudal exploitative land ownership of the landlord class and change it to peasant land ownership.

The peasants in various parts of Central South China, whose consciousness has been greatly raised through the rent reduction movement, are eagerly looking forward to changing the existing extremely unreasonable land occupation system.

According to rural surveys in Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, they can be roughly divided into areas with concentrated land occupation, areas with more dispersed land occupation, and areas with a general degree of land concentration in between. The concentration of land occupation is more severe in Hunan and Guangdong, followed by Hubei. These areas with concentrated land occupation account for about 47.5 percent of the five provinces' population. The situation of land occupation here is: landlords, who account for 3 to 4 percent of the rural population, occupy about 50 percent of the total cultivated land (including public land manipulated by landlords); in some areas, landlords occupy more than 65 percent of the cultivated land. Poor peasants and farm laborers, who account for 60 to 70 percent of the rural population, only occupy 8 to 12 percent of the cultivated land. Among the five provinces, Henan and Jiangxi have the most areas with a general degree of land concentration, followed by Hubei; in terms of population, they account for slightly more than 39 percent of the five provinces. In the southern part of Jiangxi Province, because the peasants there had distributed land before the Red Army went north to resist Japan; although the land distributed by the peasants was seized by the landlords after the Red Army went north, the land there is still more dispersed. This area with more dispersed land occupation accounts for only 13 percent of the five provinces in terms of population. Even in this area with more dispersed land occupation, poor peasants, who account for more than 60 percent of the population, only occupy 28 to 33 percent of the total cultivated land area. Landlords and rich peasants, who account for only 8 to 10 percent of the population, still occupy between 25 and 40 percent of the total cultivated land area.

  Landlords, accounting for 3.5 percent of the agricultural population, occupy 30 to 50 percent of the cultivated land.

The general situation of land occupation in the five provinces is roughly as follows: landlords, accounting for 3.5 percent of the agricultural population, occupy about 30 to 50 percent of the total cultivated land area; while middle peasants, poor peasants, and farm laborers, who account for 90 percent of the agricultural population, only occupy about 35 to 50 percent of the cultivated land. According to recent statistics from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Central South Military and Political Committee, the total agricultural population of the five provinces is 97,353,000 (about 80 percent of the total population of the five provinces), and the total cultivated land area is 278,278,263 mu. Based on this calculation, the landlord population in the five provinces is about 3.4 million, and the total cultivated land they occupy should be between 100 million and 140 million mu, with an average of 30 to 40 mu per person. The population of middle peasants, poor peasants, and farm laborers is about 77 million to 87.6 million, but the area of cultivated land they occupy is roughly equal to the cultivated land occupied by the landlord class, which is only one-twenty-fifth of the number of peasants. The peasants only have an average of about one to one and a half mu of cultivated land per person. In the Central South region, in many villages, the cultivated land occupied by one landlord's household is more than the cultivated land of all the peasants in the village. For example, the landlord Jiang Zhonghua in Echeng County, Hubei, occupies more cultivated land than the total cultivated land of 236 poor peasant households in the entire village. In Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces, there are also many large landlords who own thousands or tens of thousands of mu of cultivated land.

  Land under tenancy accounts for 40 to 50 percent of the total cultivated land area.

Peasants have no land and have to endure the cruel feudal exploitation of the landlord class. There are very few self-cultivating farmers in the Central South provinces. According to surveys in various provinces: land under tenancy accounts for about 40 to 50 percent of the total cultivated land area of the five provinces, about 140 million mu. Among them, about 50 to 70 percent, and up to more than 90 percent, are rented out by landlords, about 10 to 15 percent are rented out by rich peasants, and the rest are rented out by farmers lacking labor or other people of various strata. Of these rented cultivated land, about 80 percent is rented by poor peasants, and about 10 to 20 percent is rented by middle peasants.

  Land rent accounts for 40 to 60-70 percent of the normal produce; there are more than 20 kinds of extra-economic exploitation.

Land rent exploitation in the Central South provinces is very heavy. According to a survey of 13 typical villages in 6 special districts of Hubei Province, regardless of fixed rent, flexible rent, or sharecropping, the rent is generally between 40 and 60-70 percent of the normal produce of the land. In Shaoyang County, Hunan, the rent is usually more than 60 percent of the normal produce of the land, and the highest reaches more than 80 percent. The lowest sharecropping in Shaoyang County is "two baskets go down to the field," that is, the landlord and tenant each get half (meaning each gets one basket of grain). Generally, three, four, or even five baskets go down to the field to share the grain, the tenant only gets one basket, and the landlord gets two, three, or four baskets. Peasants also have to pay a deposit to rent land. There is also a pre-rent system, where peasants have to pay one season's rent before planting, and then pay the next season's rent every season, which is extremely unreasonable. There are more than 20 kinds of extra-economic exploitation in the Central South region. From giving the landlord free farming to giving the landlord free sedan chair carrying, inviting guests and giving gifts, and giving the landlord the first taste of new grain and fresh goods, there are many tricks. Landlords also arbitrarily increase rent and seize tenancy. In recent years, the phenomenon of landlords increasing rent and seizing tenancy has been very serious in the Central South provinces. The landlord class also uses its political power to impose barbaric oppression and land annexation on peasants. Jiang Shikun, a local tyrant landlord in Jinxian County, Jiangxi, relied on his father being a Wu Xiucai in the late Qing Dynasty, and his younger brother and son being officers and court clerks in the Kuomintang reactionaries, and his feudal exploitation and extra-economic plunder of peasants was extremely rampant; in a few decades, Jiang Shikun became a large landlord with more than a thousand mu of fertile land, while hundreds of peasant households lost their land as a result.

Due to the exploitation of the landlord class and the plunder of the Kuomintang reactionaries, rural production in the Central South provinces has been greatly reduced. Before 1930, the rice fields in the Jingzhou area of Hubei Province could produce seven dan of grain per mu, but in 1940, it dropped to about five dan per mu, and in 1949, it dropped to four dan.

The promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China has brought unlimited joy to the peasants in the Central South provinces. A peasant in Yuxian Township, Hanyang County, Hubei Province, said: "I have been planting rented land for thirty years, and I have nothing left. Now that we have Chairman Mao's good method, we will get land and will no longer be exploited by landlords." Since liberation, the rural areas of the above five provinces have undergone peasant movements of suppressing bandits, opposing local tyrants, and reducing rent. The class consciousness of the peasant masses has been significantly improved, and the organizations of peasant associations at all levels have been initially established. In the past struggles, a large number of peasant cadres have emerged, laying the foundation for land reform this winter.

　　中南区现有土地制度极不合理
    广大农民热烈盼望实行土地改革
    【新华社汉口六日电】中南区今冬将在约五千万农业人口的地区实行土地改革，其中包括河南省的一半（另一半已在今春完成了土地改革）和湖北、湖南、江西、广东等省的大部或一部。这些地区在今冬明春之间，将依据“中华人民共和国土地改革法”的规定，废除地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制，改变为农民的土地所有制。
    经过减租运动觉悟已大大提高了的中南各地农民，他们正热切盼望着改变现有的极端不合理的土地占有制度。
    根据河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东五省的农村调查，大致可分为土地占有集中地区、土地占有较分散地区和界于两者之间的土地集中程度一般的地区。土地占有的集中情况，湖南、广东较甚，湖北次之。这种土地占有集中的地区，以人口计，约占五省的百分之四十七点五。这里土地占有的情况是：占农村人口百分之三到百分之四的地主，占有的耕地约为耕地总面积的百分之五十左右（包括被地主操纵的公田在内）；部分地区，地主占有耕地竟达百分之六十五以上。占农村人口百分之六十到百分之七十的贫农、雇农等，却仅占有耕地百分之八到百分之十二。五省中土地集中程度一般的地区，河南、江西最多，湖北次之；以人口计，占五省的百分之三十九强。江西省南部地区，因为那里的农民在红军北上抗日以前曾分过土地；红军北上后，农民所分土地虽被地主所夺，但该地土地仍较分散。这种土地占有较分散的地区，以人口计，仅占五省的百分之十三。就在这种土地占有较分散的地区，占人口百分之六十以上的贫农，占有的耕地也只有总耕地面积的百分之二十八到百分之三十三。占人口仅百分之八到百分之十的地主和富农，占有的耕地却仍在耕地总面积的百分之二十五到百分之四十之间。
  占农业人口百分之三点五的地主，占有耕地百分之三十到五十。
    五省土地占有的总情况大致是：占农业人口百分之三点五的地主，占有耕地约为耕地总面积的百分之三十到百分之五十；而占农业人口百分之九十的中农、贫农和雇农，只占有百分之三十五到百分之五十左右的耕地。据中南军政委员会农林部最近时期的统计，五省农业人口总数共为九千七百三十五万三千余人（约占五省总人口的百分之八十），耕地总面积为二亿七千八百二十七万八千二百六十三市亩。按此核算，五省中地主人口约为三百四十万，共占有的耕地当在一亿到一亿四千万亩之间，每人平均占有三十亩到四十亩。中农、贫农和雇农的人口约为七千七百万到八千七百六十多万，占有耕地的面积却和在人数上只有农民二十五分之一的地主阶级所占有的耕地大致相等。农民们每人平均只有耕地一亩到一亩半左右。在中南地区，很多村庄一户地主所占有的耕地比全村农民的耕地还多。如湖北鄂城县地主姜仲华，他一户占有的耕地面积，比全村二百三十六户贫农共有耕地还多。广东、湖南、湖北等省，拥有数千亩或数万亩耕地的大地主也不少。
  处在租佃关系中的土地，占耕地总面积的百分之四十到五十。
    农民没有土地，不得不忍受地主阶级残酷的封建剥削。中南各省的自耕农民是很少的。据各省调查：处在租佃关系中的土地，约占五省耕地总面积的百分之四十到五十，即一亿四千万亩左右。其中地主出租的约占百分之五十到七十，最高达到百分之九十以上，富农的约占百分之十到百分之十五，其余是缺乏劳动力的农户或其他各阶层人民出租的。这些出租耕地由贫农租入耕种的占百分之八十，中农约占百分之十到百分之二十。
  地租租额占正产物百分之四十到百分之六、七十；超经济的额外
        剥削有二十多种。
    中南各省地租剥削是很重的。据湖北省六个专区中十三个典型村庄的调查，不管定额租、活租或分租，租额一般都在土地正产物的百分之四十到百分之六十、百分之七十之间。湖南邵阳县的租额，通常都在土地正产物的百分之六十以上，最高达到百分之八十多。邵阳县的分租最低是“两个箩下田”，即主佃各分一半（意指两箩谷子各分一箩）。一般是三个箩或四个箩甚至五个箩下田分粮，佃户只得一箩，地主得两箩、三箩或四箩。农民佃入土地还要缴纳押金。还有一种有预租制，农民种地前即须缴一季租，以后每季缴下一季的租，极不合理。超经济的额外剥削，在中南区各省多到二十多种。从给地主无偿种田到给地主无偿抬轿，请客送礼，新粮鲜货下来要送地主尝新，凡此等等，花样百出。地主还任意加租夺佃，近年来中南区各省这种地主加租夺佃的现象非常严重。地主阶级并依其政治权力，对农民横施野蛮的压迫和土地兼并。江西进贤县恶霸地主江士鹍，依仗着他父亲在清末当过武秀才，他的弟弟和儿子又在国民党反动派当军官和法院书记官，对农民的封建剥削和超经济的掠夺极为猖獗；数十年间，江士鹍变成拥有良田千余亩的大地主，而数百户农民却因此失去了土地。
    由于地主阶级的剥削，加以国民党反动派的掠夺，就使中南区各省农村生产大大降低。湖北省荆州一带的稻田，在一九三○年以前，每亩可产谷七担，一九四○年每亩降到五担左右，一九四九年降到四担。
    中华人民共和国土地改革法的颁布，给中南区各省农民带来了无限的喜悦。湖北汉阳县玉贤乡一个农民说：“我种了三十年稞田（即租田），自己落得一手空。现在有了毛主席这个好办法，我们分了土地，以后再不受地主剥削了。”上述五省农村自解放以来，都经过了剿匪、反恶霸和减租的农民运动，农民群众的阶级觉悟已显著提高，并初步建立了各级农民协会的组织。农民群众在历次斗争中涌现了大批农民干部，为今冬的土地改革打下了基础。
