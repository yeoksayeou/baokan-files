　　Workers and Peasants are One Family
　　The mountainous areas of eastern Zhejiang generally lack double-cropping rice. In Longkeng Village, Zuoxi Township, Liangnong District, Yuyao, although there is early rice, it matures half a month later than in the plains, and the rice heads are still green. During this period between harvests, the lives of villagers without labor, or lacking labor, as well as widowers, widows, orphans, and the solitary become difficult.
　　At this critical moment, Longkeng Village suddenly received a sum of relief money from Shanghai workers. The peasants were all delighted. It turned out that a month ago, Gu Wenzhang, a worker from the Shanghai Tianli Nitrogen Plant, came to Longkeng Village to visit relatives. At that time, he saw the farmers' brothers living in such hardship, especially the poor peasant Zhang Mingguo, whose life was difficult to maintain due to sores. He expressed deep sympathy and generously took out the remaining 25,000 yuan (RMB) in his pocket to help. After returning to Shanghai, he immediately mobilized some employees from the Tianli and Tianyuan plants, explained the current plight of the farmer brothers, and aroused the sympathy of the worker brothers. As a result, another 282,000 yuan was donated and remitted to Longkeng Village by the People's Bank. At that time, the village cadres were beaming with joy. The next day, they convened a mass meeting and, after democratic discussion, distributed the money to twelve households in difficulty. Granny Zhang, with her gray hair, said gratefully: "20,000 yuan can buy fifteen or sixteen catties of rice. I can boil it with green pumpkin and get through until the rice harvest. I will never forget how good the worker brothers are!" Some said, "The workers' lives are not very good either, and they still come to help us."
　　At the same time as remitting the money, worker Gu Wenzhang also wrote a letter to the township government, saying: "Dear Comrades: I am a mechanic from the Shanghai Tianli Nitrogen Plant. Workers and peasants are one family. I came to Zuoxi Longkeng Village last month to visit relatives. Seeing the farmer brothers living in hardship, some unable to eat three meals a day, and some filling their stomachs with bran, I felt deep sympathy after witnessing this scene..." The letter fully expressed the spirit of class love. The letter also offered suggestions to the township government: "Regarding the current temporary difficulties, we should explain to the peasants, ask everyone to endure the hardship for a while longer, closely contact the masses, strengthen propaganda and education on the importance of land reform, point out the happy future of the peasants, mobilize the masses, develop sideline production, and overcome the temporary difficulties."

　　天下工农是一家
    浙东山区，一般均缺少双季稻，余姚梁弄区左溪乡龙坑村，虽有早稻，但成熟期要比平原区迟半个月，稻头还是青溜溜的。在这个青黄不接的时期，村中一般无劳动力或缺少劳动力以及鳏、寡、孤、独户的生活就发生了困难。
    当此紧要关头，龙坑村忽接到上海工人一笔救济款子。农民莫不欢喜。原来在前一个月有一个上海天利氮气厂的工人顾文章，来龙坑村访亲，当时看到农民兄弟生活这样困难，尤其看到贫农张明国，因患疮生活实在难于维持，深表同情，当时就慷慨地拿出了袋里尚余的二万五千元人民币相助。当他返沪后，即马上发动了天利、天源两厂的部分职工，说明了农民兄弟目前的困苦，激发了工人弟兄的同情心，于是又捐募了二十八万二千元，由人民银行汇款到龙坑村。当时村干都高兴得眉笑颜开，第二日就召开了群众大会，经民主评议，分配给十二户困难户。头发斑白的张婆婆很感激地说：“二万元钱，好买十五、六斤米，青南瓜煮煮吃，到稻上好度过了。我一生一世也勿忘记工人兄弟这样好！”有的说：“工人生活也不太好，还来救济我们”。
    工人顾文章在汇款的同时还写了一封信给该乡乡公所，信上说：“亲爱的同志们：我是一个上海天利氮气厂的机匠。工农本是一家人，我上月来左溪龙坑村省亲，看见农民弟兄生活困苦，有的三餐不继，有的麸糠充饥，目睹之景，深表同情……”，在信中充分表现了阶级友爱的精神。信中更向乡政府提供了意见：“对目前的暂时困难，应该对农民加以解释，要求大家再忍一时苦，密切联系群众，加强宣传教育土地改革的重要性。指出农民的幸福前途，发动群众，开辟副业生产，克服暂时的困难”。（转载本月八日上海新闻日报）
