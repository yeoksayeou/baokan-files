Xinhua News Agency Report: The Northeast rural youth league members played an active role in this year's summer hoeing. After the Heilongjiang, Jilin and other provincial youth league work committees instructed local league organizations at the beginning of summer to actively mobilize the masses to earnestly ensure multiple hoeings, timely hoeings, promote new farm tools, and overcome insect plagues, many league branches formulated summer hoeing plans, launched competitions, and used league newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and forums to promote early hoeing by farmers.

At the beginning of summer hoeing, rural youth league branches in various places invited experienced farmers to introduce summer hoeing experience to promote timely hoeing by all villagers. Villages with league organizations generally completed three hoeings and three weedings ahead of schedule.

Female league members in rural areas universally broke the old custom of not working and led women to participate in summer hoeing. In Hei Quan Yan Village, Changling County, Jilin Province, driven by female league members, more than 200 women hoeed 3,900 mu of land and weeded more than 2,900 mu. In Pengjia Village, Suizhong County, Liaoxi Province, 16 female league members led more than 60 women to participate in summer hoeing, hoeing more than 1,100 mu of land.

Some league members in rural areas have learned and promoted the use of new farm tools. For example, Pang Chengde, a league member from Datong Village, Fujin County, Songjiang Province, first learned how to operate the weeder and introduced his experience at a mass meeting to help other farmers using weeders master the technology. With the help of league members Jin Fu and Wu Guangjun, farmers in Mengjiazhai Village, Kaiyuan County, Liaoxi Province, used more than 30 double-wheeled plows, which not only enabled the whole village to generally achieve multiple hoeings, but also solved the problem of insufficient animal power.

In some insect-affected areas, league members actively promoted insect extermination, broke the masses' superstitious ideas about insect plagues, and rose up to exterminate pests. When pests were found in the valley in Lujia Wopu Village, a suburb of Changchun City, the farmers were superstitious and dared not catch them. Youth league members led the capture on the one hand and went deep into the masses to publicize and mobilize on the other, organizing more than 60 women and children to go to the fields to catch insects. Zoujia Village in Liuhe County, Liaodong Province, also launched an insect-catching campaign due to the promotion of league members, eliminating disasters for more than 1,000 mu of crops.

### 东北农村青年团  积极推动夏锄工作  保证作到多铲多趟、铲趟及时

　　东北农村青年团
    积极推动夏锄工作
    保证作到多铲多趟、铲趟及时
    【新华社讯】东北农村青年团员在今年的夏锄工作中起了积极的作用。黑龙江、吉林等省青年团工作委员会于夏初指示各地团的组织积极发动群众切实作到多铲多趟、铲趟及时、推广新农具、克服虫灾等工作后，许多团支部都订立了夏锄计划，发动了竞赛，并利用团报、黑板报、座谈会等，推动农民提前铲趟。
    在夏锄开始时，各地农村青年团支部纷纷邀请富有经验的农民介绍夏锄经验，推动全村农民及时铲趟。凡是有团的组织的村子，一般都提前完成了三铲三趟。
    农村中的女团员普遍打破了不劳动的旧习俗，领导妇女参加夏锄。吉林省长岭县黑泉眼村在女团员推动下，二百余名妇女共铲地达三千九百亩，薅草二千九百余亩。辽西省绥中县彭家村十六名女团员，带动六十多名妇女参加夏锄，共铲地一千一百余亩。
    有些农村的团员，学会并推广了新农具使用方法。如松江省富锦县大同村团员庞承德首先学会了锄草机的操作方法，在群众大会上介绍经验，以帮助其他使用锄草机的农民掌握技术。辽西省开源县孟家寨村农民在团员金富、吴广君帮助下，使用了三十多台双轮犁，不但使全村普遍做到多铲多趟，并解决了畜力不足的困难。
    部分虫灾地区，团员们积极宣传灭虫，打破了群众对虫灾的迷信想法，起来扑灭害虫。长春市郊陆家窝堡村发现谷地里有害虫，农民迷信，不敢捉；青年团员一面带领捕捉，一面深入群众宣传动员，组织起六十多名妇女、儿童下地捕虫。辽东省柳河县邹家村也由于团员的推动，开展了捕虫运动，使一千多亩庄稼去除了灾害。
