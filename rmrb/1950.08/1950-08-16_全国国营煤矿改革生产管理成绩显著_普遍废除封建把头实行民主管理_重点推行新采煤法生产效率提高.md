　　[This report] According to news from this newspaper: National state-owned coal mine production has achieved significant success in the first half of this year. The total completion of the annual planned output for all mines is 44.7 percent. Among them, the Northeast region completed 46 percent of the annual task, exceeding the predetermined plan for the first half of the year. Due to adjustments in production and sales relationships in the regions within the customs [关内], the production plan has undergone many changes midway. While ensuring industrial coal use, fully meeting people's needs, and reducing the accumulation of national funds, North China completed 45.71 percent of the annual task, East China completed 42 percent (missing data from Zhangqiu Mine), and Central South completed 40 percent. In terms of coal mine production and management, several significant reforms were carried out in the first half of the year: Firstly, coal mines within the customs generally abolished or are in the process of abolishing the feudal foreman system that cruelly exploits workers, thereby enhancing the workers' class consciousness and production enthusiasm, laying the foundation for improving coal mine production. Secondly, the method of coal mining was reformed with focus and step-by-step. In the Northeast, some mining areas have achieved remarkable results. The recovery rate of thick coal seams has increased from the original 30 percent to 80 percent, and the normal efficiency of direct labor has reached 8.1 tons. Difficulties such as poor ventilation have also been resolved. For this new coal mining method, North China and East China have selected several wellheads and working faces to carry out key experiments. Mines in Central South, which were liberated later, are also preparing conditions for the promotion of the new coal mining method. With the success of these major reforms, the average coal production efficiency in the second quarter has significantly improved compared to the average efficiency of last year. The Northeast region increased by 28.9 percent, North China by 31.8 percent, East China by 11 percent, and Central South by 52 percent. In terms of safety, although a major unfortunate accident like the Yi-Luo Coal Mine occurred in the first half of the year, since the national first coal mine meeting in November last year proposed the policy of safe production, in general, mine safety work has greatly improved compared to last year. After several major safety inspections in various mines in the Northeast region, and after changing thousands of equipment that did not meet safety specifications, the number of work-related injuries has dropped from 11.35 per 10,000 tons of coal last year to 7.24 in the first half of this year. During the same period, the number of deaths dropped from 0.24 per 10,000 tons of coal to 0.209. Although accidents have decreased, the problem is still serious. In particular, most of the accidents that occurred were preventable liability accidents. Therefore, thoroughly implementing the concept of safety first and completely eliminating liability accidents is still the primary task in current coal mine production. Secondly, it is urgently needed to vigorously promote new coal mining methods. At present, only a few coal mines or individual sites in some mines have implemented new coal mining methods. In mine sites that have already reformed coal mining methods, the management system and organizational structure are often not in line with the new requirements and need to be thoroughly reformed. The reason why the new coal mining method is not easy to promote is mainly due to the resistance of some cadres' conservative thinking. They are reluctant to abandon outdated old experience and unwilling to accept new technologies. They do not have sufficient understanding of the basic link of promoting new coal mining methods to improve production. Great efforts are still needed.

　　全国国营煤矿改革生产管理成绩显著
    普遍废除封建把头实行民主管理  重点推行新采煤法生产效率提高
    【本报讯】全国国营煤矿生产，今年上半年获得重大成就。各矿总计完成本年度计划产量的百分之四四点七，其中东北完成全年任务的百分之四六，超过了上半年预定计划；关内各区因产销关系的调整，生产计划中途多有变更，在保证工业用煤，充分供应人民需要，同时减少国家资金积压的情况下，华北完成全年任务的百分之四五点七一，华东完成百分之四二（缺章邱矿数字），中南完成百分之四十。在煤矿生产和管理上，上半年曾经进行了若干有重大意义的改革：首先关内煤矿普遍废除了或正在废除着残酷剥削工人的封建把头制，从而提高了工人的阶级觉悟与生产积极性，给改进煤矿生产奠定了基础。其次是有重点、有步骤的改革采煤方法，在东北，某些矿区已获得显著成绩。厚煤层的回收率，已由原来的百分之三十提高到百分之八十，直接工的正常效率已达八点一吨。并解决了通风不易等等困难。对于这一新采煤方法，华北华东各矿已选定若干井口和工作面，实行重点试验。解放较晚的中南各矿，亦正为推广新采煤法准备条件。随着这些重大改革的成功，第二季度的产煤平均效率与去年平均效率相比已显著提高。计东北区提高百分之二八点九，华北区提高百分之三一点八，华东区提高百分之一一，中南区提高百分之五二。在保安方面，上半年中，虽曾发生了象宜洛煤矿那样的重大不幸事故，但自去年十一月全国第一次煤矿会议提出安全生产的方针后，总的说来，矿山保安工作已较去年有很大改进，今年第二季度的伤亡事故又比第一季度减少了百分之八十。东北区各矿经过几次保安大检查，改变了几千件不合保安规格的设备后，公伤数字已由去年每万吨煤的一一点三五人降至今年上半年的七点二四人，同一时间的死亡数则由每万吨煤的零点二四人降至零点二○九人。事故虽已减少，但问题仍是严重的，特别在所发生的事故中，绝大部分属于可能避免的责任事故。因此深入贯彻保安第一的思想，完全消灭责任事故，仍是当前煤矿生产中的首要任务。其次，急需大力推行新采煤方法。目前还只有少数煤矿或某些矿的个别场子实行了新采煤方法；在业已改革了采煤方法的矿场，管理制度与组织机构又多不合新的要求，尚需彻底改革。新采煤方法不易推行的原因。主要是受到某些干部保守思想的抵抗，他们舍不得抛弃过时了的旧经验，不愿接受新技术，他们对推行新采煤方法是提高生产的基本环节认识不足。还须作巨大的努力。（燃料工业部通讯组）
