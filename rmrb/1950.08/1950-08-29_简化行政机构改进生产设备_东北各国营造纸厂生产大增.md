　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 28th: This year, the papermaking industry in Northeast China has seen significant improvements in production. The total output value of state-operated paper mills is 21.9% higher than the entire year of last year, and production costs have been reduced by 20% compared to the original plan. In terms of quality, the loss rate of paper from various factories has also decreased from 10% to 1%. These achievements are due not only to the restoration and improvement of some equipment but also to the streamlining of institutions and the implementation of a single-person responsibility system over the past six months. At the end of last year, the old production organization of each factory had not been changed. Below the factory director, there were sections, offices, units, teams, and workshops, with many layers, making it difficult for the factory director to promptly understand the production situation and direct production. Management was only divided into four sections: planning, management, personnel, and general affairs, which was very unscientific; and the responsibilities of the factory director and deputy director were parallel, with both managing everything and yet neither managing anything. These phenomena seriously hindered the healthy development of production. After the simplification of institutions in the first half of this year, the layers of offices, units, and teams were generally eliminated, and the workshop was used as the basic unit of production, making it easier for the factory director to grasp the production situation; the division of labor in management is clearer than before, dividing into sections such as design and planning, personnel, wages, accounting, supply, finished products, transportation, general affairs, technology, and production, assisting the factory director in taking sole responsibility for various tasks. The deputy director and engineers work under the direct leadership of the factory director. This makes the factory director the sole person responsible for grasping the overall production situation. In terms of restoration and construction, the papermaking equipment capacity has been restored to 80% of the puppet Manchurian period in the past six months, while it was only 65% at the end of last year.

　　简化行政机构改进生产设备
    东北各国营造纸厂生产大增
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】今年上半年，东北的造纸工业生产有重大改进。各国营造纸厂的生产总值，比去年全年还多百分之二十一点九，生产成本较原计划降低了百分之二十；质量方面，各厂纸张的损失率也已由百分之十降为百分之一。上述成就除由于恢复和改进了一部分设备而外，还由于半年来简化了机构实行了单一负责制。去年年底时各厂旧的生产组织仍相沿未改。厂长以下设有科、室、股、班、车间等，层次很多，厂长不易及时了解生产情况并指挥生产。管理上只分计划、经理、人事、总务四科，很不科学；而正副厂长职责平行，遇事都管，而又都不管。这些现象，严重地妨碍了生产的健全发展。今年上半年简化机构以后，一般都取消了室、股、班的层次，而以车间为生产的基本单位，使厂长便于掌握生产情况；管理上的分工已较前明确，分设计划、人事、工资、会计、供应、成品、运输、总务、技术、生产等科，辅助厂长专责进行各项工作。副厂长和工程师则是在厂长直接领导下进行工作。这样，就使厂长成为掌握全面生产情况的唯一负责人。在恢复建设方面，半年来造纸设备能力已恢复到伪满时期的百分之八十；而去年年底时仅为百分之六十五。
