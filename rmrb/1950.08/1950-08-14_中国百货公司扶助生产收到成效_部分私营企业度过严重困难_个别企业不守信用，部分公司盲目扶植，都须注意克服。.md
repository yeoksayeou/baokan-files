Xinhua News Agency, 11th: China's state-owned department stores have achieved results in supporting production with large amounts of capital, enabling some private industries to overcome their most difficult periods. However, in the process of acquisition, some private enterprises have not kept their word or have held incorrect attitudes towards the support of national trade organizations. At the same time, some regional department stores still exhibit blind support.

Since the nationwide implementation of unified finance and economics, and the end of inflation, businesses in various locations have experienced slow sales of goods. Most private factories have experienced poor capital turnover, falling into a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown. To enable factories to maintain production, the state-owned China Department Store Company allocated 643,546,990,000 yuan and 2,500 bales of cotton yarn to the North China, East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest regional companies in the four, five, and six months to support industries with good prospects and more difficulties through methods such as acquisition, ordering, and commissioned processing.

In these three months, the total value of goods purchased by the China Department Store Company nationwide through commissioned processing, ordering, and direct acquisition reached 584,911,993,000 yuan, of which products from private factories accounted for more than 70%. This enabled some private factories that had been shut down or were on the verge of shutdown to obtain funds and raw materials, thus restoring normal production. Taking Shanghai, the city with the most difficulties, as an example, in May, the number of private factories whose finished products were acquired or who entered into processing and ordering contracts with department stores reached 502, accounting for more than 40% of the city's private light industrial households. In June, this increased to 818, accounting for more than 70% of the city's private industrial households. Among them, 30% had originally been shut down, and 30% were struggling to maintain production. After the support, most of them have overcome the most difficult period. Some have even begun to expand production due to the recovery of market purchasing power and increased product sales. For example, of the city's 40 shirt factories, 35 had originally been shut down. After the department store placed orders, all of them resumed work; and the price, which was not enough to cover costs, has recovered to a general profit of 5% to 10%. Since the arrival of the peak sales season after the start of summer, the industry's output is in short supply, some have added night shifts, and some are hiring temporary workers to expand production.

In Tianjin, the number of factories acquired or ordered by department stores in May was also 596, including the previously shut down Xincheng, Dasheng, Guanghua paper mills, and the Tianjin Glass Factory, all of which have resumed production. Relatively large-scale private factories in the city, such as Yongli Chemical Company, suffered from slow product sales. Its ammonium sulfate plant in Nanjing had once stopped production on April 1, and its alkali plant in Tianjin was also struggling to maintain production. After the department store acquired 3,500 tons of ammonium sulfate, 148,000 bags (80 kg each) of soda ash, and 2,733 tons of caustic soda, normal production has resumed. The Yaohua Glass Factory was also on the verge of shutdown in mid-April. Production was maintained after the department store acquired more than 38,300 boxes of glass in stock.

Most of the private factories in various locations supported by the China Department Store Company are able to abide by their commitments and actively improve their own operations, gradually achieving self-sufficiency at cost. However, many private enterprises have adopted incorrect attitudes towards government support. Some private factories simply rely on government acquisitions. For example, the Changsha Cotton Textile Industry United Factory requested that the company unconditionally acquire its products. Tianjin Longruixiang, which produces Bai Ge milk powder substitute, even falsely reported costs, attempting to earn high profits from the state-owned department store's acquisition of its products. Some private factories cut corners or used good quality goods as samples for price negotiations and then delivered inferior goods. For example, when the Tianjin Department Store acquired cigarettes from the Hengxin, Guansheng, Meihua, and Huaxing factories, the cigarette industry association guaranteed that they would not become moldy within a month and a half. However, the transaction was completed on May 10, and on the 16th, the cigarettes were found to be moldy. Merchants returned the goods to the company, which affected the company's reputation and caused a loss of 34 million yuan. Similarly, when the Jiangxi Provincial Company acquired Liangxin brand soap in Nanchang, it was found that the water content was higher than the original sample. After negotiations, the factory admitted the mistake of cutting corners. In addition, some private factories did not fulfill their contracts in processing orders, delaying delivery or having no goods upon expiration, causing the company to suffer financial losses.

At the same time, some regional department stores still exhibit blind support. For example, the Guangdong Department Store entrusted the Guangzhou Guangzhong Cigarette Factory to process more than 33,700 jin of Xuchang tobacco leaves during the yellow plum season. When the goods were received, the price of tobacco had plummeted, resulting in a total loss of more than 51 million yuan. At the same time, due to the rainy season, merchants did not purchase goods, and the stored cigarettes could not be sold in time, resulting in most of them becoming moldy. In addition, some regional department stores did not understand the actual production situation of the factories and blindly entrusted processing or ordering, so that some factories that did not produce the goods the department store wanted to order also came to the company to contract orders, and then turned to other factories to order goods, in order to seek intermediate profits.

In view of the above situation, the China Department Store Company has issued a notice requiring regional branches to continue to overcome the phenomenon of blind support, stipulate the specifications and quality of finished products in processing orders, and strictly fulfill contracts, so that the company does not suffer losses and promote private factories to improve production. At the same time, private industrial and commercial circles should also strive to guard against speculation and trickery, and cooperate with the government in an honest manner to achieve the goal of overcoming difficulties and restoring and developing production.

　　中国百货公司扶助生产收到成效
    部分私营企业度过严重困难
    个别企业不守信用，部分公司盲目扶植，都须注意克服。
    【新华社十一日讯】国营中国百货公司以大量资金扶助生产，使一部分私营工业度过最困难时期。但在收购过程中，有的私营企业不守信用或对国家贸易机关的扶植抱有不正确的态度，同时有的地区百货公司还存在着盲目扶植现象。
    自全国财经统一实施，通货膨胀的局面结束以后，各地工商业曾发生货物滞销现象，大部分私营工厂资金周转不灵，陷于停顿或半停顿状态。为使工厂维持生产，国营中国百货公司曾于四、五、六三个月内以资金六千四百三十五亿四千六百九十九万元及棉纱二千五百件，分拨华北、华东、中南、西南、西北各区公司，以收购、定货、委托加工等方式，有重点地扶助有发展前途而困难又较多的工业。
    三个月中，中国百货公司在全国范围内经委托加工、定货及直接收购等方式所购进的商品，总值达五千八百四十九亿一千九百九十三万元，其中私营工厂产品占百分之七十以上，因而使一部分已停工或濒于停工的私营工厂获得资金和原料，因而恢复正常生产。以困难最多的上海市为例，五月份经百货公司收购成品和订立加工、定货合同的私营工厂达五百零二家，占全市私营轻工业户百分之四十强。六月份又增加到八百一十八家，占全市私营工业户百分之七十以上。其中百分之三十原已停工，百分之三十勉强维持生产，经扶助后已大部度过最困难时期。有的并因市场购买力恢复，产品销路增加，已开始扩大生产。如该市四十家衬衣工厂，原已停工三十五家，经百货公司定货后已全部复工；且已由售价不够成本恢复到一般能获利百分之五到百分之十。入夏以后，旺销季节已到，该业产量供不应求，有的已加开夜工，有的正添雇临时工，扩大生产。
    天津市五月份经百货公司收购、定货的工厂也有五百九十六家，其中原已停工的新成、大生、光华等造纸厂和天津玻璃厂等都已恢复生产。该市规模比较大的私营工厂，如永利化学公司，由于产品滞销，在南京的硫酸铔厂四月一日起曾一度停工，在天津的碱厂也难维持生产。经百货公司先后收购了三千五百吨硫酸铔、十四万八千袋（每袋八十公斤）纯碱及两千七百三十三吨火碱后，已恢复正常生产。耀华玻璃厂四月中也濒于停工，经百货公司收购存货三万八千三百余箱玻璃后，生产才得以维持。
    经中国百货公司扶助的各地私营工厂多数能够遵守信用，并积极改善本身经营，逐渐做到保本自给。但也有不少私营企业对政府的扶助采取了不正确的态度。有的私营工厂单纯依靠政府收购。如长沙市棉织业联合工厂要求公司无条件地收购其产品。出产百鸽代乳粉的天津隆瑞祥号，甚至虚报成本，企图在国营百货公司收购其产品中赚取高利。有的私营工厂偷工减料，或以好货作样品议价，以次货成交。如天津百货公司收购恒信、冠生、美华、华兴四厂的纸烟时，曾由卷烟业公会出面保证一个半月内不发霉。但五月十日成交，十六日即发现纸烟霉坏，商贩纷纷向公司退货，因此影响了公司的信誉，并使公司损失资金三千四百万元。又如江西省公司在南昌收购良心牌肥皂，发现所含水份较原样多，经交涉后，厂方才承认偷工减料的错误。此外，也有的私营工厂在加工定货中不履行合同，迟交货，或到期无货，致使公司资金遭受损失。
    同时，有些地区的百货公司也还存在着盲目扶植的现象。如广东省百货公司在黄霉季节以许昌烟叶三万三千七百余斤委托广州光中烟厂加工，到进货时烟价大跌，共亏损五千一百多万元。同时因在雨季，商贩多不进货，所存香烟不能及时销出，以致大部发霉。另有的地区的百货公司不了解工厂实际生产情况，盲目委托加工或定货，以致有些工厂本身不生产百货公司所要订购的物品，也来公司承揽定货，然后再转向其他工厂订货，以牟取中间利润。
    鉴于上述情况，中国百货公司曾发出通知，要求各地区分公司继续克服盲目扶植现象，并在加工定货中规定成品的规格与质量，并严格履行合同，使公司不受损失，并促进私营工厂改善生产。同时私营工商业方面，也应力戒投机取巧，以老老实实的态度来和政府合作，以达到克服困难，恢复和发展生产的目的。
