　　The Growth of a People's Artillery Company
    Bai Bing
    As early as the initial period of the Agrarian Revolutionary War, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army seized mountain guns and mortars from the Kuomintang reactionary army and established its own artillery force. In smashing the Kuomintang bandit army's "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and in the subsequent battles of the 25,000-Li Long March, the Red Army's artillery force heroically completed the task of coordinating with infantry operations. When the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army broke through the Kuomintang bandit army's heavy blockade and arrived at the anti-Japanese front in northern Shaanxi after a long march and battles, the Red Army artillery force preserved three of its companies. One of these companies is the predecessor of the Fourth Company of a certain howitzer regiment of the Third Field Army today.
    This mortar company was reorganized into the artillery company of the 686th Regiment of the 115th Division of the Eighth Route Army at the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War. It had only four mortars at that time. After the Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War, it finally developed into a modern artillery company with several American-made howitzers.
    After arriving at the anti-Japanese front, the artillery company first participated in the famous Battle of Pingxingguan in Shanxi. Then, it advanced into the enemy's rear with the Second Brigade of the Teaching Brigade of the Eighth Route Army's 115th Division and, in coordination with the infantry, opened up the situation of the anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare in Shandong. In the Liangshan battle in southwestern Shandong in 1939, they cooperated with the infantry to annihilate a Japanese battalion, capturing three heavy guns, one infantry gun, and two field guns for the first time. The commanders and fighters of the mortar company were extremely happy to get these guns. However, the Japanese were very anxious. In order to recapture these guns, the Japanese launched a frantic mop-up and search against the Eighth Route Army. The situation was very tense, so the artillerymen disassembled the field guns and buried them separately, dragging the infantry guns to circle around with the enemy. The infantry guns were different from the mortars, and no one knew how to use them. Deputy squad leader Zhang Desheng pulled the breechblock open, but couldn't press it back. In the end, they had to find a Japanese prisoner to fix it. The artillerymen began to learn the knowledge of using new-style cannons. After three months of study, the artillerymen began to use infantry guns to attack the enemy. In battle, in order to meet the urgent needs of the battle, the artillerymen often pushed the infantry guns to a place only one or two hundred meters away from the enemy for direct aiming and shooting. When the Japanese army's mopping-up operation was extremely urgent, they disassembled the gun, wrapped it in dog skin, and buried it in a coffin. When the military situation eased, the infantry gun crawled out of the ground again to roar at the enemy.
    The artillery company, together with other fraternal arms, followed such an arduous road to victory in the Anti-Japanese War.
    In January 1947, the People's Liberation Army annihilated the Kuomintang army's First Rapid Column, which was invading the liberated areas, in the Battle of Lunan, and seized a large number of American-made howitzers. After obtaining a large number of American-made equipment, the mortar company was ordered to be reorganized into the first howitzer company of the Third Field Army.
    The artillerymen accepted the task of learning to use these newest American-made howitzers. They united with the Kuomintang army artillerymen who had been liberated, raised their political consciousness, humbly learned technology from them, and strived to improve their cultural level and scientific knowledge. In less than half a year, the entire company eliminated illiteracy, and most of the artillerymen learned the four arithmetic operations of integers and the division and setting (artillery terms). They also continuously improved their skills in actual combat, making themselves quickly become excellent modern people's artillerymen.
    Shortly after the company was established, the howitzer company participated in the Tai'an Campaign. The gunners used indirect aiming and shooting at a distance of five thousand yards, driving away the enemy's artillery observation post and destroying the enemy's howitzer positions. In the Battle of Linyi in June of the same year, they used more than 40 shells to defeat a regiment of Kuomintang troops coming to reinforce, killing and wounding more than 800 enemy officers and soldiers. In subsequent battles such as Jinan, Huaihai, Crossing the Yangtze River, and the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands, the artillery company achieved higher hit rates and greater victories each time.
    With the victorious development of the Liberation War, the People's Liberation Army annihilated more enemies and captured more weapons. The Third Field Army's howitzer force was developed on the basis of this howitzer company. The Third Field Army now has a powerful heavy artillery force equipped with a large number of American-made howitzers. In this artillery force, this company, which developed from the mortar company of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to today's modern artillery company, is a glorious banner.

　　一个人民炮兵连队的成长
    白冰
    远在土地革命战争的初期，中国工农红军从国民党反动军队手中夺来山炮和迫击炮，建立了自己的炮兵部队。在粉碎国民党匪军的“围剿”和以后二万五千里长征的历次作战中，红军的炮兵部队英勇地完成了协同步兵作战的任务。当工农红军突破国民党匪军的重重封锁，经过长途行军作战，到达抗日前线陕北的时候，红军炮兵部队保存了自己的三个连队。其中的一个连队，就是今天第三野战军某榴弹炮团第四连的前身。
    这个迫击炮连在抗战开始时，被编为八路军一一五师六八六团的炮兵连，它当时仅有迫击炮四门，经过抗日战争、人民解放战争，它终于发展成为一支拥有若干门美式榴弹炮的近代化的炮兵连队了。
    在开上抗日前线以后，炮兵连首先参加了著名的山西平型关大战。接着，它就随着八路军一一五师教导旅第二旅挺进到敌人后方，配合步兵打开了山东抗日游击战争的局面。在一九三九年鲁西南的梁山战斗中，他们协同步兵歼灭了日寇一个大队，第一次缴获了三门重炮、一门步兵炮和两门野炮。迫击炮连的指战员们，得了这些炮，真是快乐极了。可是，日寇却很着急。为了夺回这几门炮，日寇对八路军展开了疯狂的清剿搜索，情况非常紧张，炮兵们就把野炮拆卸开，分头埋藏起来，拖着步兵炮和敌人打圈子。步兵炮不比迫击炮，大家都不会使用，副班长张德胜拉开了炮拴，怎么也按不上去，最后还是找日本俘虏来才上好。炮兵们开始来学习使用新式大炮的知识。在经过了三个月学习以后，炮兵们就开始使用步兵炮来打击敌人。在战斗中，由于要满足战斗的迫切需要，炮兵们常常把步兵炮推到离敌人只有一、二百米的地方去，直接瞄准射击。在日寇扫荡情况万分紧急的时候，他们就把这门炮拆开，用狗皮包好装在棺材里埋起来。到军事情况一缓和，步兵炮就又从地下爬出来向敌人怒吼了。
    炮兵连和其他兄弟兵种一道，就是这样地，经过艰苦的道路，走向抗日战争的胜利。
    一九四七年一月，人民解放军在鲁南歼灭了向解放区进犯的国民党军第一快速纵队，缴获了大批美式榴弹炮。迫击炮连在获得了大批美式装备以后，就奉命改编为第三野战军的第一个榴弹炮连。
    炮兵们接受了学会使用这些最新式的美式榴弹炮的任务。他们团结了解放过来的国民党军炮兵，提高他们的政治觉悟，向他们虚心学习技术，努力提高自己的文化水平和科学知识。不到半年时间，全连就消灭了文盲，大部分炮兵学会了整数四则和分划装定（炮兵术语）。他们还在实战中不断提高自己的技术，使自己迅速地成为优秀的近代化的人民炮兵。
    就在该连成立以后不久，该榴弹炮连参加了泰安战役。炮手们以五千码的间接瞄准射击，打跑了敌人的炮兵观测所，摧毁了敌人的榴弹炮阵地。在同年六月的临沂战役中，他们用四十多发炮弹打垮了前来增援的国民党军一个团，毙伤匪军官兵八百多人。在以后的济南、淮海、渡江和解放舟山群岛等历次战役中，这个炮兵连一次比一次的获得了更高的命中率，取得了更大的胜利。
    随着解放战争的胜利发展，人民解放军歼灭了更多的敌人，缴获了更多的武器。第三野战军榴弹炮队就以这个榴弹炮连为基础发展起来。第三野战军现在已经有了一支强大的配备有大批美式榴弹炮的重炮部队。在这支炮兵部队里，这个从工农红军的迫击炮连发展为今天近代化炮兵的连队，是一面光辉的旗帜。
