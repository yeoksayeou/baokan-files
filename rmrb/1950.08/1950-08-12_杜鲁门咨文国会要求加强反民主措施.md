　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, August 11th: Under the pretext of needing to strengthen domestic security in the United States, Truman, in a new message to both houses of Congress on the 8th, proposed a series of anti-democratic laws, attempting to use this to prompt Congress to take measures to further deprive the American people of their democratic rights.

　　In the message, Truman fiercely attacked progressives.

　　Truman specifically suggested that Congress strengthen the current "Espionage Act," suggesting that the law be amended, first to give the authorities the opportunity to persecute the international connections of progressive political organizations—primarily the Communists—as espionage activities.

　　In the message, Truman suggested further legislation "to grant the President broader powers than he now has to determine the security regulations related to protecting military bases and other defense equipment." Truman also proposed legislation "allowing the Attorney General to monitor foreigners to be deported" and stipulating that obvious police action be taken against these people. Regarding this, Truman mentioned the Hobbs Bill recently passed by the House of Representatives, which allows for the indefinite detention of non-American citizens who should be deported.

　　The remainder of Truman's message is a crude attack on the communist movement. The American President boasted that he would destroy "communism."

　　杜鲁门咨文国会要求加强反民主措施
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社华盛顿讯：借口需要加强美国国内的安全，杜鲁门于八日在致国会两院的新咨文中提出了一连串反民主的法律，企图借此促使国会采取措施，进一步剥夺美国人民的民主权利。
    杜鲁门在咨文中，猛烈地攻击进步分子。
    杜鲁门具体地建议国会加强现行“间谍活动法”，建议修正该法，首先规定给当局以机会，来把进步政治组织——首先是共产党人——的国际联系当做间谍活动而加以迫害。
    在咨文中，杜鲁门建议进一步制定立法，“赋予总统以比现在更广泛的权力，由总统来确定有关保护军事基地及其他国防设备的安全条例”。杜鲁门并提议制定立法，“允许司法部长监视要被驱逐出境的外国人”，并规定对这些人采取明显的警察行动。关于这一点，杜鲁门提到众院新近通过的霍布斯法案，该法案允许无限期地扣留应该驱逐出境的非美公民。
    杜鲁门咨文的其余部分是对共产主义运动的粗暴攻击，美国总统吹嘘他将毁灭“共产主义”。
