　　The Youth Miners' Home in Czechoslovakia
　　Our Correspondent Hua Junwu
　　We visited the Youth Miners' Home in the northeastern industrial area of Czechoslovakia, near Ostrava, a city producing coal and iron.
　　Ostrava began its coal mining industry as early as 1821, and the Czech people proudly call this area the Czech Donets (the Soviet coal and iron producing region). This area is full of tall chimneys, blast furnaces, and mine shafts. Most of the city's residents are workers.
　　The Youth Miners' Home belongs to the system of the government's Department of Social Welfare. Within this department, there is a Central Committee for Youth Workers, which has various sections for youth workers, such as agricultural youth and industrial youth. The industrial youth section is further divided into coal mining, iron smelting, and other sections. These sections are then divided by region, such as the Ostrava Coal Mining Area, the East Bohemia Coal Mining Area. These large areas are further divided into many small regional youth miner centers.
　　The place we visited is called the Karvina District (which belongs to the Ostrava area). Therefore, there is an organization here called the Karvina District Youth Miner Center. This center consists of three parts: 1. the Youth Miners' Home, 2. the Youth Miners' Training Institute, and 3. the school, forming a center for cultivating young miners.
　　Young miners work in the mine for four days a week. For every four young miners, there is an excellent veteran miner teaching them. In the coal mine, there is a special mine site designated as their training and working place, called the Youth Miners' Training Institute. The remaining two days are spent studying at school. In addition to political and social science courses, the school also teaches specialized subjects such as mathematics, mechanical principles, mining metallurgy, and physical chemistry. The Youth Miners' Home is their dormitory and a place for extracurricular activities. The young miners earn about 2,000 to 2,500 crowns (Czech currency) per month, which is about one-half to six-tenths of the minimum wage of an ordinary miner. Apart from paying 750 crowns for meals, everything else is provided by the state. After they start working, the government provides them with clothes, bedding, pajamas, and other necessary items. The government treats miners very favorably because coal is an important raw material supplier in industry. In mid-July of this year, because so many young miners were recruited, President Gottwald personally received the young miners at the presidential villa. On that day, the President also wore a miner's uniform and talked with the young miners, thanking the Czech Youth League for helping the government mobilize Czech youth to join the miners, and also thanking the mothers of the young miners for allowing their sons to participate in the country's industrial construction.
　　We visited two Youth Miners' Homes. One was temporary, because the new building had not yet been completed, so they lived in a former aristocratic villa. When we went there, some young miners' parents were visiting their children. The rooms were all arranged neatly and cleanly, with pictures of revolutionary leaders hanging on the walls. They decorated the rooms beautifully, some with flowered paper, some with vases of flowers. They told us that on September 11th this year—the Czech Miners' Festival—the President would come to visit the Youth Miners' Home. The other one was a newly built building, which included a conference room, an auditorium, a library, a dining room, etc. Every eight to a dozen people formed a group, and each group had an extremely spacious bedroom, with steel-wire beds and clean bedding. In addition, there were bathrooms with enough space for five or six people to shower at the same time, and wardrobes for storing clothes. More than 500 young miners lived in this building, working and studying at the same time.
　　We also visited their kitchen and laundry room, where the government hired people to cook and do laundry for them. Everything from cooking, washing vegetables, cutting vegetables, washing and drying clothes was done by machine.
　　These young miner apprentices will become formal miners in three years. They will become one of the main forces in building a socialist Czechoslovakia.

　　捷克的青年矿工之家
    本报记者  华君武
    我们在捷克东北部的工业区，产煤铁的奥司脱拉伐城附近，参观了青年矿工之家。
    远在一八二一年，奥司脱拉伐城即开始有煤矿工业，捷克人民光荣地称呼这个区域为捷克的顿尼兹（苏联的产煤铁区）在这一区域中都是高大的烟突、鼓风炉和矿井，城中居民大都为工人。
    青年矿工之家是属于政府的社会福利部的系统。在这个部中有一青年工人中央委员会，下设有各种青年工人的部分，例如农业青年，工业青年等，工业青年下边又分着煤矿，冶铁等部分，而在这些部分下又以区域的公布而分为如奥司脱拉伐区煤矿，东波希米亚区煤矿，这样的大区域中又分着许多小区域的青年矿工中心。
    我们去的地方就称为卡尔维那区（这是属于奥司脱拉伐区的）因此这里就有一个组织名为卡尔维那区的青年矿工中心，这个中心由三部分组成：一、青年矿工之家，二、青年矿工实习所，三、学校，构成一个培养青年矿工的中心。
    青年矿工每一星期有四天在矿中工作，每四个青年矿工就有一个优秀的老矿工在教授他们，在煤矿中，辟有专门的矿场作为他们实习和工作的场所，叫作青年矿工实习所。其余两天就在学校学习，学校中除进行政治和社会科学的课目外，而且教授数学、机械原理、冶矿学、物理化学等专门课目；青年矿工之家就是他们的宿舍和进行业余活动的场所。青年矿工们每月约有二千到二千五百克朗（捷币）的工资，约等于一个普通矿工最低工资的二分之一到十分之六，他们除了缴纳七百五十克朗的伙食费外，其它全部由国家供给，他们参加工作后，政府发给他们衣服被子，睡衣及应用的物件。政府对矿工是很优待的，因为煤矿是工业中重要的原料供给者。今年七月中，因为吸收了许多青年矿工，哥特瓦尔德总统还亲自在总统别墅中招待青年矿工，那一天总统也穿着矿工的制服，和青年矿工们谈话，感谢捷克的青年联盟帮助政府动员捷克的青年参加矿工，也感谢了青年矿工的母亲们让她们的儿子来参加国家的工业建设。
    我们曾参观了两个青年矿工之家，一个是临时的，因为新的房屋尚未建成，所以住在一幢过去是一个贵族的别墅中，我们去的时候，有些青年矿工的父母正在探望他们的孩子。房屋中都布置得干干净净。挂着革命领袖的像片，他们把房屋装饰得很美，有的饰以花纸，有的装着瓶花，他们告诉我们，今年九月十一日——捷克的矿工节——总统将要来参观青年矿工之家的。另一所是新建的房屋，其中有会议室、礼堂、图书室、饭厅等等，每八人到十几人为一小组，每一组都有一间极其宽阔的寝室，一律是钢丝的床铺和清洁的被褥，除此以外，还有可容五六人同时沐浴的洗澡间和装衣服的橱柜。在这个建筑中住着五百多青年矿工，他们一边工作一边在学习着。
    我们同时去参观了他们的厨房和洗衣房，由公家雇了人替他们做饭洗衣。一切的做菜，洗菜，切菜，洗和晒干衣服都是用机器的。
    这些青年矿工学徒，三年之后就将变成正式的矿工。他们将成为建设社会主义捷克的主要力量之一。
