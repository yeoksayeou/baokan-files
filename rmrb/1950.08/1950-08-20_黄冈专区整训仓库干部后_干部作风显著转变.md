　　Huanggang Prefecture Rectifies Warehouse Cadres,
    Cadre Style Significantly Changes
    [This newspaper dispatch] After reorganizing warehouse cadres in various counties of Huanggang Prefecture, Hubei Province, and rectifying them through training, combined with inventory checks, some were reformed and others were dismissed. This has led to a step forward in the political awareness of the general cadres, and in this year's summer grain requisition work, they have gradually corrected their past bad habits.
    The warehouse cadres in this prefecture were originally put together temporarily during last year's autumn grain requisition. Newly joined and retained personnel accounted for the vast majority, and their composition was complex. Therefore, in their work, many cadres showed serious corruption, distortion of policies, and other bad practices, which aroused public dissatisfaction and caused great losses to the work. In order to improve the quality of cadres and establish a clean and honest work style, the Commissioner's Office, in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Government, earnestly carried out reorganization. Through training, combined with inventory checks, the good ones were rewarded, and the bad ones were punished according to the severity of their circumstances, reformed, or dismissed. Of the 750 warehouse cadres in the eight counties of the entire prefecture, except for Huangmei County, which was not rectified, the rest were trained in batches by county, with a total of 590 participants. After studying documents, conducting criticism and self-criticism, and reflecting on their thoughts, they frankly exposed many mistakes. The number of corrupt individuals alone reached 186, accounting for 31.5% of the trainees; 94 had corrupt behavior; and 153 had bad habits such as beating, tying, and hanging people, accounting for 25.9% of the total number of trainees. Among them, in Macheng County, 25 out of 54 first-time trainees were corrupt, almost half; and 40 had tied, beaten, or detained the masses. These figures all show that the corruption of warehouse cadres in this prefecture was extremely serious. For this reason, in the final stage of the rectification, each county combined it with inventory checks, and through democratic methods, carried out evaluation of merits, commendation of models, and punishment of corruption. Those who were actively responsible, honest, and upright in their work were praised and rewarded; those who were corrupt were given appropriate treatment according to the severity of their circumstances. A total of 179 people were commended and rewarded, accounting for 30.3% of the total number of trainees.
    After this rectification, among the more than 400 cadres retained in the counties, the general political awareness has been raised by one step, and the vast majority of cadres have realized that past mistakes have seriously damaged the interests of the people, and they have initially established the concept of serving the people. In this summer's grain requisition, the style of the cadres has undergone significant changes.

    干部作风显著转变
    【本报讯】湖北黄冈专区整编各县仓库干部，通过整训，结合清仓，分别加以改造或解职，使一般干部在政治上已提高一步，并在今年夏征工作中，已将过去的不良作风逐渐改正。
    该专区仓库干部原系在去年秋征中临时凑合，新参加及留用人员占绝大多数，且成份复杂，故在工作中不少干部表现了严重的贪污腐化，歪曲政策等恶劣作风，引起群众不满，并使工作受到极大损失。专署为提高干部质量，树立廉洁奉公的作风，曾根据省府指示，切实进行整编，通过整训、结合清仓，好的予以奖励，坏的分别情节轻重依法处罚和改造或解职。计全区八个县七百五十个仓库干部，除黄梅一县没有整训外，其余均以县为单位分期轮训，共计参加整训的五百九十人，经过学习文件、进行批评与自我批评，以及思想反省后，坦白暴露出不少错误。仅贪污者即有一百八十六人，占受训人数百分之三十一点五，有腐化行为者九十四人；作风恶劣有打人、捆人、吊人等行为者一百五十三人，占受训总数百分之二十五点九。其中麻城一县第一次受训者五十四人中，贪污者即有二十五人，几作半数；有捆、打和扣押群众行为者四十人。这些数字都说明了该专区仓库干部的贪污腐化是极其严重的。为此，在整训的最后阶段，各县均结合清仓，通过民主方式，进行评功表模及惩处贪污。使在工作中积极负责、廉洁奉公、作风正派者，均得到表扬和奖励；贪污腐化者依情节轻重分别予以适当处理。计得功受奖者一百七十九人，占受训总数百分之三十点三。
    经过这一整训后，各县留用的四百多名干部中，一般的在政治上都提高了一步，绝大部分干部都认识到过去的错误严重地损害了人民的利益，初步树立了为人民服务的观点。这次夏征中，干部的作风，已有显著的改变。
