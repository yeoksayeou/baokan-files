Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Comprehensive TASS report: The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, to be built on the Volga River according to a recent decision by the Soviet Council of Ministers, will be the world's largest power station. This power station will enable collective farmers in five states, including Kuibyshev and Saratov, to obtain large quantities of river water to irrigate one million hectares of land for planting wheat, developing orchards, and increasing the acreage of fiber and oil crops.

The director of the Hydroelectric Power Station Design Bureau, Zhuk, wrote in the Pravda on the 22nd, pointing out that the Volga River possesses abundant power resources. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station is being built in the middle reaches of this river, appropriately below the confluence where the Oka and Kama Rivers flow into the Volga, making the river even wider. The Volga River then flows into a dry zone stretching for hundreds of kilometers. Developing large irrigation systems can realize Stalin's plan to transform nature, turning this vast grassland into fertile farmland and a new granary for the Soviet Union.

Zhuk continued: The construction of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station and large reservoir will create all the necessary conditions for large ships to navigate long distances on the Volga and Kama Rivers. At the same time, a large town for construction workers will also be established. This city will have many factories and manufacturing plants and be connected to all parts of the country by railway branch lines. Thousands of engineers and technicians will enthusiastically participate in the design and construction of the power station. Many factories manufacturing turbines, hydroelectric generators, and steel equipment will be mobilized.

　　世界上最大的水力发电站
    古比雪夫发电站即将兴建
    一百万公顷土地将获灌溉之利
    【新华社二十九日讯】综合塔斯社消息：将按照苏联部长会议最近的决定在伏尔加河畔建造的古比雪夫水力发电站，将是世界上最大的电力站，这个电力站要使古比雪夫、萨拉多夫等五个州的集体农民，获得大量的河水来灌溉一百万公顷的土地，以种植小麦、开辟果园，并增加纤维与油类作物的栽种面积。
    水力发电站设计局局长朱克于二十二日在真理报撰文指出：伏尔加河蕴藏着大量的动力资源，古比雪夫水力发电站就建造在这条河的中游，适当俄卡河与卡马河流入伏尔加河而使河身更加壮阔的汇合点的下方。伏尔加河往下即流入绵亘数百公里的干燥地带。开辟大的灌溉系统就能实现斯大林改造自然的计划，把这片大草原变成肥沃的良田，变成苏联的新的谷仓。
    朱克继称：建造古比雪夫水力发电站和大蓄水池，将为大的船只在伏尔加河及卡马河上的长距离的航行，创造一切必要的条件。同时，一座建筑工人的大城镇也将随着建立起来。这座城市将拥有许多工厂与制造厂，并有铁路支线与全国各地相通。数千名工程师与技师将热烈地参加发电站的设计与建设工作。许多制造透平、水力发电机与钢铁器材的工厂均将动员起来。
