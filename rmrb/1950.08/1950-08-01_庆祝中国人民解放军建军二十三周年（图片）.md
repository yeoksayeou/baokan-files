Celebrating the 23rd Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

	① After the failure of the Great Revolution, Chairman Mao led the communists to shift from the cities to the countryside, implementing land reform and armed struggle. He and Commander-in-Chief Zhu established the first people's revolutionary base area in Jinggang Mountain. The comrades in this photo participated in the revolution in Jinggang Mountain at that time. Those marked with "△" are Chairman Mao.
	② The ranks of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army participating in the Long March in 1934.
	③ During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army was the first to advance into the enemy's rear. On September 25, 1937, the Eighth Route Army fought a great battle at Pingxingguan, annihilating more than 3,000 soldiers of the Japanese Kou Itagaki Division. It was the first great victory in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. The picture shows Pingxingguan. Those entering the pass are cavalry of the Eighth Route Army.
