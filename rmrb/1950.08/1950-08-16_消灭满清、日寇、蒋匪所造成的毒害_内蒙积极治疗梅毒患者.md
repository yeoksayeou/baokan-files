Xinhua News Agency, 10th. The People's Governments of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Suiyuan Province are both actively engaged in treating syphilis among the Mongolian people. The Inner Mongolia region has also formulated a comprehensive plan to eradicate syphilis, which is being implemented step by step.

Syphilis has caused immense suffering and harm to the Mongolian people. According to statistics from some areas, such as the Hulunbuir League, Xilingol League, and Chahar League in the Inner Mongolia region, syphilis patients account for 70% to 80% of the population. In the Ulanqab League's Siziwang Banner in the Suiyuan region, 80% of the 90 people examined were also patients. Due to the severity of syphilis, the Mongolian population is showing a downward trend. For example, in Maoming'an Banner in the Suiyuan region, only one infant was born throughout the past year. Note: Syphilis originated from the poisonous schemes of the Manchu Qing rulers. They consciously created abnormal male-female relationships among the Mongolian people, causing promiscuity and disease, in an attempt to exterminate the Mongols. During the rule of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, this reactionary policy continued. Therefore, after the liberation of Inner Mongolia, eliminating the long-term harm of syphilis and restoring national health has become an urgent demand of the people of Inner Mongolia.

Since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government three years ago, it has conducted preliminary treatment for syphilis patients in conjunction with various tasks. In February of this year, a planned pilot project to eradicate syphilis was carried out in Wangong Sumu (Sumu is the Mongolian equivalent of a village) in Chen Banner, Hulunbuir League. Under the leadership of the local Communist Party and the People's Government, a Syphilis Eradication Committee and a Syphilis Eradication Station were established, widely publicizing the dangers of syphilis and treatment methods, and explaining the root causes of the disease in conjunction with treatment examples. By June 22, the entire pilot project was successfully completed, with a total of 570 patients cured. Based on the experience of the pilot project, the Health Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government has formulated a comprehensive plan to eradicate syphilis, striving to eliminate the syphilis epidemic in Inner Mongolia within five to ten years. In addition to actively training cadres, it is also planned to gradually establish syphilis eradication stations in various banners and counties, as well as syphilis eradication and prevention clinics in Sumu, starting from next year.

As soon as the Suiyuan Provincial People's Government was established, it paid attention to the work of eradicating syphilis, which is of great importance to the lives of the Mongolian people, and sent medical teams to treat patients in different areas. In mid-July, three professors and sixty-eight students from the Peking University Medical College formed a summer Sui-Meng "Anti-Syphilis" work team, carrying a large number of special drugs for the treatment of syphilis with the assistance of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, and went to Ulanqab and Ikhezu Leagues to conduct key medical treatment in conjunction with investigation and research, which was warmly welcomed by the Mongolian people.

### 消灭满清、日寇、蒋匪所造成的毒害  内蒙积极治疗梅毒患者

　　消灭满清、日寇、蒋匪所造成的毒害
    内蒙积极治疗梅毒患者
    【新华社十日讯】内蒙自治区人民政府和绥远省人民政府都正在积极展开对蒙族人民的梅毒病的治疗工作。内蒙区并已制定全面驱除梅毒方针，正在逐步实施。
    梅毒病给与蒙族人民极大的痛苦和毒害。据部分地区的统计：如内蒙地区的呼伦贝尔盟、锡林格勒盟及察哈尔盟梅毒病患者占该区人口百分之七十到八十；绥远地区的乌兰察布盟四子王旗九十个人检查的结果，其中患者也占百分之八十。由于梅毒病患严重，蒙族人口显示着下降的趋势。例如，绥远地区之茂明安旗在去年全年中，只有一个婴儿出生。按：梅毒病来源于满清统治者的毒计。他们有意识地使蒙族人民男女性关系不正常，造成性乱和疾病，以图灭绝蒙族。日寇、蒋匪统治时期，仍继续此种反动政策。因此，内蒙解放后，驱除梅毒的长期毒害，恢复民族健康，便成为内蒙人民的迫切要求。
    内蒙自治区人民政府建立三年以来，曾结合各种工作，对梅毒病患者进行了初步的治疗。今春二月又在呼纳盟陈旗完工苏木（苏木即蒙古相当于村的单位）进行了有计划的驱除梅毒的重点试验工作。当地共产党和人民政府领导成立了驱除梅毒委员会及驱除梅毒站，广泛宣传梅毒的危害性和治疗方法，并结合治疗实例解释患病的根源。至六月二十二日全部重点试验工作胜利完成，共治好患者五百七十名。内蒙自治区人民政府卫生部根据重点试验经验，已制定全面驱除梅毒的计划，争取在五年至十年内扫清流行内蒙的梅毒病。现除积极训练干部外，并计划明年由点到面逐步建立各旗、县驱除梅毒站及苏木的驱除梅毒防治所等组织。
    绥远省人民政府一成立，即关心到这一与蒙族人民生活关系极大的驱除梅毒病工作，派出医疗队分区治疗。七月中旬北京大学医学院教授三人，学生六十八人又组成暑期绥蒙“抗梅”工作队，在中央人民政府卫生部协助下，携带大批治疗梅毒特效药，分赴乌兰察布、伊克昭两盟结合调查研究，进行重点医治，受到蒙族人民热烈欢迎。
