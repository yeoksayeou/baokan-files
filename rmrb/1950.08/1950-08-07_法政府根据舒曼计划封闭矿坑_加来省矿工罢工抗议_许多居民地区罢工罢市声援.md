    Many Residential Areas Strike and Close Shops in Solidarity
    [Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 6th] Paris dispatch: Workers at the No. 7 mine in Auchy, Pas-de-Calais, France, have been on strike since late July to protest the French government's unreasonable decision to close the mine based on the Schuman Plan. This strike has quickly gained widespread sympathy and support. Fifty nearby residential areas held 24-hour solidarity strikes, and all shops closed for two hours. More than 13,000 miners have participated in the solidarity movement. Slogans and leaflets are being posted everywhere, demanding that the people turn the day of the strike into a day of protest against the authorities' anti-national policies. Mayors and councilors have also signed those slogans and leaflets.
    In addition, rallies protesting the closure of mines have been held in various places near Auchy. Participants at the rallies expressed solidarity with the striking miners. Residents have established all-circles people's committees to defend the miners.
    The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communique praising the struggle of the miners in Auchy and the solidarity and support of all miners for the miners in Auchy.
