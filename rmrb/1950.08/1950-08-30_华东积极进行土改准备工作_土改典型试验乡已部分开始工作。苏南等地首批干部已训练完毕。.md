　　East China Actively Prepares for Land Reform
    Pilot Land Reform Townships Partially Begin Work; First Group of Cadres in Southern Jiangsu and Other Areas Complete Training.
    [Report from this newspaper] East China is actively preparing for land reform. Currently, the focus of the preparation work is: training cadres, conducting pilot projects, and rectifying grassroots organizations in districts and townships. Since spring, various localities in the region have, in accordance with the instructions of the East China Military and Political Committee regarding land reform preparation, launched mass movements to establish and improve grassroots farmers' associations and transform grassroots political power through production and disaster relief, and the suppression of bandits and local despots; they have also been conducting typical investigations to thoroughly understand the specific situation in rural areas and prepare the conditions for land reform. After the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, the East China Military and Political Committee convened its second plenary session in mid-July to specifically discuss the land reform issue, defining the scope of land reform areas in East China, the implementation measures for land reform in East China, the allocation and training plan for land reform work teams, and the steps for pilot projects.
    Currently, the preparation situation for land reform in various parts of East China is as follows: First, typical investigations in various localities have basically concluded. The pilot project townships directly led by the provincial people's governments began work successively in July. The pilot project work in each special district also began in August. Each county will carry out pilot projects between September and October. The work of the Songjiang pilot project township directly led by the East China People's Government is scheduled to end in August, and a summary will be conducted. The summary of the pilot project township work in the entire region will be conducted in September. There are a total of about 370 pilot project townships in the entire East China region.
    Second, the training of cadres and staff members for the land reform work teams is planned to be carried out in August and September and is scheduled to end by the end of September; work teams will be formed to go to the countryside to carry out land reform preparation work in conjunction with the autumn grain collection. The number of work teams in each province and district (equivalent to a provincial-level administrative region) is planned to be 80,000, of which about 6,000 are cadres at the district head level or above, and 20,000 are general district and township-level cadres. Each province, special district, and county plans to train a total of more than 100,000 people. Currently, the first group of cadres in the Southern Jiangsu and Northern Jiangsu districts has completed training and has gone to the countryside to work. The second group is beginning to gather. Seven hundred educated youths in Fujian have completed training. Zhejiang, Fujian, and Southern Anhui have decided to transfer and train 53,000 farmer activists, and this is currently underway. Various localities plan to complete the autumn grain collection work in October and November; and gradually launch the land reform movement in December, ending in March next year.
    Third, the land reform committees of each province and district have begun to be established. Land reform committees at all levels above the county level will be established in August and September. Through production work, the farmers' associations and grassroots political power in districts and townships in the areas scheduled for land reform will be rectified and transformed before the autumn grain collection.
    Fourth, in order to expand the publicity and education work of land reform, a land reform propaganda committee has been formed under the leadership of the East China Bureau, and responsible comrades from various departments have been appointed as teachers. Large classes are being held in a planned manner in various organs, schools, cultural organizations, and democratic parties in Shanghai. Other major cities are also preparing to organize land reform propaganda committees to carry out this work.
    In addition, in order to facilitate the command of the land reform work in various places, it has been decided that each county will have a dedicated radio, and telephones will be installed to the county level. The above work is currently being actively prepared.
    According to statistics, among the seven provinces and districts in East China, there are more than 117.7 million agricultural population, of which 45 million are in areas that have undergone land reform, and 72 million are in areas that have not undergone land reform. Among the areas that have already undergone land reform, about 6 million people (2 million in Shandong and 4 million in Northern Jiangsu) are in areas where land reform has been completed. There are still 39 million people in Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui where land reform has not been completely completed. The new areas that are preparing to implement land reform this winter and next spring are: 6 million people in Shandong, 9 million people in Northern Jiangsu, 9.9444 million people in Southern Jiangsu, 3.8 million people in Southern Anhui, 11.18 million people in Zhejiang, 1.7 million people in Fujian, and 5.4 million people in Northern Anhui (not yet finalized). The suburbs of large cities such as Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou will not undergo land reform this winter due to immature preparation conditions.

　　华东积极进行土改准备工作
    土改典型试验乡已部分开始工作。苏南等地首批干部已训练完毕。
    【本报讯】华东正积极进行土地改革准备工作。目前准备工作的重点是：训练干部、典型试验、整顿区乡基层组织。该区自春季以来，各地即根据华东军政委员会关于土地改革准备工作的指示，通过生产救灾、剿匪反霸，发动群众建立与健全基层农民协会，改造基层政权；进行典型调查，切实了解农村具体情况，准备土地改革条件。中华人民共和国土地改革法公布后，华东军政委员会即于七月中旬召开了第二次全体委员会，对土地改革问题作了专门讨论，规定了华东土地改革地区范围，华东土地改革实施办法，土地改革工作队的配备与训练干部计划，以及典型试验的步骤等。
    目前华东各地土地改革的准备情况是：一、各地典型调查已基本结束。各省人民政府直接领导的典型试验乡，已于七月先后开始工作。各专区的典型试验工作，也已于八月开始。各县则将于九、十月间进行。华东人民政府直接领导的松江典型实验乡的工作，定于八月结束，并进行总结。全区的典型试验乡的工作总结，将于九月进行。全华东区共计有典型试验乡三百七十个左右。
    二、土地改革工作队干部及工作人员的训练，计划在八、九两月份进行，定于九月底结束；组成工作队下乡，结合秋征进行土改准备工作。各省、区（等于省的行政区）工作队人数计编成八万人，其中区长级以上干部约六千人，一般区乡级干部为两万人。各省、专区、县计划训练人数，共十万余人。现苏南区、苏北区首批干部已整训完毕，并已下乡工作。第二批正开始集中。福建七百知识青年已训练完毕。浙江、福建、皖南决定调训农民积极分子五万三千人，目前已着手进行。各地计划于十、十一两月完成秋征工作；十二月开始逐步展开土地改革运动，至明年三月结束。
    三、各省区的土地改革委员会已开始建立。县以上各级土地改革委员会将于八、九两月内建立起来。并通过生产工作，在秋征以前将预定进行土地改革地区的区乡农民协会、区乡基层政权，整理改造完毕。
    四、为了扩大土地改革的宣传与教育工作，在华东局领导下组成了土地改革宣传委员会，聘请各部门的负责同志为教员。在上海各机关、学校、文化团体、民主党派中，有计划地上大课。其他各大城市也都准备组织土改宣传委员会进行此项工作。
    此外，为了便于指挥各地土地改革工作的进行，确定每县专设一架收音机，电话架设到县。上述工作现正积极筹备中。
    按华东区七个省区中，共有农业人口一亿一千七百余万，其中经过土改的地区有四千五百万人，尚有七千二百万人口的地区未经土地改革。已经土地改革的地区中，约有六百万人口（山东二百万、苏北四百万）地区已结束土改。山东、苏北、皖北尚有三千九百万人口地区未完全结束土改。准备今冬明春实行土地改革的新区为：山东六百万人，苏北九百万人，苏南九百九十四万四千余人，皖南三百八十万人，浙江一千一百一十八万人，福建一百七十万人，皖北五百四十万人（尚未最后确定）。沪、宁、杭等大城市郊区，因准备条件尚不成熟，今冬暂不进行土地改革。
