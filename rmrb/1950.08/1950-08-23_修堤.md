Repairing the Dike
    Guo Renzhi
    Victory

    The next day when work started, Little Li carried a literacy board with large chalk characters written on it:
    “Production is a long-term endeavor, working recklessly harms the body, diligence plus skill is what's needed, avoid crash programs.”

    Carrying earth today was different from yesterday. You relieve me, I relieve you, but Ma Zhiyong always let Little Li do light work and less of it, while he did heavy work and more of it. This made Little Li feel embarrassed, so he kept trying to take on more. Ma Zhiyong kindly said, “Let those of us with more strength carry more, those with less strength hoe more, division of labor and cooperation is all the same, don’t go for ‘equality’." Little Li felt an indescribable gratitude in his heart upon hearing this.

    “Hey, comrades, don’t rush, advance steadily and surely!" The instructor stood on a high knoll and shouted as if singing a ballad.
    "Right, advance!" Everyone echoed loudly.

    "Hey! Look, our company commander is a third-class disabled soldier, but he's still working so hard."
    "Great, let's work!"

    After the break signal sounded, Ke Cheng put down his carrying pole and picked up a shovel again. Others said, “Rest a bit, Ke Cheng, catch your breath!”
    "Okay, just a few more shovels and the basket will be full. Otherwise, those carrying earth will have to wait when work starts.”

    “Hey, comrades, have some water, mung bean soup.” Cook Old Wu shouted while setting down his burden, and in a flash, he jumped into the sixth squad’s earth pit: “Good! The sixth squad is really great, come on, let me carry these few baskets.” As he spoke, he started working.
    "Rest a bit, Old Wu, you're tired enough." Everyone kindly advised him.
    "How could I be as tired as you!" He continued to carry with great energy.
    "Old Wu is planning to compete for model worker." Little Wangzi from the fifth squad said playfully.
    "There's such a clause in the progress plan…." Old Wu said with a smile.

    Everyone drank water, and without needing to be summoned, they gathered in groups of three or five to hold technical discussions. Ke Cheng, as if he had made a new discovery, said: "In the future, when we start each section, we should fill the baskets with more soil, walk faster; and when we climb a slope, we should fill them with less.”
    "Agreed, I say that when we dump the soil, we shouldn't do 'ba kuang' (dumping the soil in a way that doesn't meet engineering requirements), we should follow the engineering requirements and try to make the dike stronger."
    "Right, right." Everyone unanimously approved Ma Zhiyong's suggestion.

    The meeting was over. Ma Zhiyong saw that work hadn't started yet, so he took out his literacy book, reciting and gesturing, learning the three new characters Little Li had taught him this morning.

    The work signal sounded, and everyone hopped and skipped into battle.

    In this way, the earth pit became deeper and larger day by day, and the dike became higher and higher. The sixth squad completed five days' worth of work in three days. They increased from an average of just over two cubic meters of earth per person on the first day to six and a half cubic meters.

    The instructor introduced to the entire company how the sixth squad had initially committed the error of reckless work, and how they later took the mass line, and how they found ways to improve techniques and implement mutual aid. Everyone let out a thunderous roar: "Learn from the sixth squad."

    But the sixth squad was not arrogant because of their victory. Everyone was of one mind: "We must work harder, be more humble, be diligent plus skilled, and only allow it (the amount of earth moved) to increase, not to decrease."

    Consolation

    People passing by stepped onto the dike that had been repaired by the People’s Liberation Army, now neat, flat, and solid, and their hearts were so full of joy and gratitude that they seemed about to burst.

    The villagers, to express their gratitude to their army, sent the village chairman and several representatives to the command headquarters with eggs and cigarettes to offer comfort. But the comrades at the command headquarters repeatedly refused to accept them. One representative—an old woman with graying hair—said with some annoyance: "You must accept them, this is the opinion of the entire village, we can't go back on our word!" She took a breath and said gratefully, “That day I walked onto the dike and saw how hard the comrades were working, the common people really can't compare. While carrying earth, the comrades kept shouting: 'Watch the wheat seedlings, don't step on them.' After work, they were so tired but they didn't rest, they even helped us fetch water and chop straw, and on Sundays, they even helped us hoe the fields.... There are so many good things the comrades do, I can't finish telling them all.... The things aren't much, it's just a token of our appreciation, no matter what, you have to accept them.”

    The comrades at the command headquarters had no choice but to accept. As they were leaving, the village chairman extended his dark and sturdy working hand, tightly grasped the hand of the comrade from the command headquarters, and said with a smile, "During the war, you held guns and fought for the people. After the victory, you participated in the great production and built dikes for the people. You really are the good army of the people led by Chairman Mao."

　　修堤
    郭仁之
    胜利
    第二天上工时，小李扛着识字牌，上面写着拳头大的粉笔字：
    “生产长期事，拚命害身体，肯干加技术，千万别突击。”
    今天担土，可不同昨天了。你换我、我换你，马志勇总让小李干轻活、少干，自己干重活、多干。这使小李不好意思起来，就一个劲儿抢着担。马志勇亲切地说：“咱们劲大的多担，劲小的多锄，分工合作都是一个样，别闹‘平均’。”小李听着心里有着说不出的感激。
    “嘿，同志们，别着急，稳扎稳打向前进。”指导员站在高岗上象唱快板似的高声喊。
    “对，向前进！”大家响亮的回音。
    “喂！你们看，咱们连长是三等残废，还干的那么凶。”
    “好哇，干呀！”
    休息号响后，克成放下担子又拿起锨来。别人说：“息息吧，克成，缓缓劲！”
    “行，再几锨筐就装满了。要不，开工时担土的还得等着。”
    “喂，同志们喝水吧，绿豆汤。”炊事员老吴边喊边放下担子，一窜就上了六班的土坑里：“好！六班真是棒，来，我来挑这几筐。”说着就行动起来。
    “息息吧老吴，你们够累了。”大家关心地劝阻。
    “怎么也没你们累呀！”还是一鼓劲的担。
    “人家老吴打算争模范呢。”五班的小王子俏皮地说。
    “进步计划上有那么一条……。”老吴笑着说。
    大家喝着水，不用召集，都三一群五一伙的凑在一块开起技术讨论会来。克成象有什么新发现似的说：“咱们以后在每段开始时，筐里多装些土，走快点；要一爬坡就少装些。”
    “同意，我说咱们倒土时别倒扒筐（不合乎工程要求的倒土法），要按工程要求，想法把堤打得更结实。”
    “对，对。”马志勇的意见大家一致通过了。
    会开完了。马志勇看看还不开工，就掏出识字本，嘴念、手动，学习今早上小李教给他的三个生字。
    开工号响了，大家一蹦一跳的进入了战斗。
    这样，土坑一天比一天深大，堤一天比一天高。六班在三天内完成了五天的工程。他们由头一天每人平均两方多土提高到六方半（土方数）。
    指导员给全连介绍了六班开始怎样犯拚命主义，后来怎样走群众路线，怎样想办法改进技术、实行互助的情形。大家发出雷般的吼声：“向六班看齐。”
    但六班并没有因胜利而骄傲，大家一个心：“更要努力，更要虚心，肯干加技术，只许让它（土方数）长不让它掉。”
    慰劳
    往来行路的人们踏上了已被解放军修得整齐、平坦、牢固的堤时，欢喜而感激的心象要跳出来似的。
    村子里的人们为了表示他们对自己军队的心意，分推村主席和几位代表拿着鸡蛋、纸烟等到指挥部来慰劳。但指挥部的同志再三不收。一位代表——头发斑白的老大娘带气说：“不收也得收，这是全村老百姓的意见，俺们可不能推翻呀！”她喘了口气又很感激地说：“那天我走到堤上去，看到同志们那个劲儿，老百姓真比不了。同志们担着土还不断地喊：‘看麦苗，别踩了。’下了工，那么累也不闲着，还给俺们挑水、铡草，星期日还给锄地……。同志们的好处真是说不完……。东西不多，是俺们一点心意，不管怎么样，你们得收下。”
    指挥部的同志没法，只得收下了。临走时，村主席伸出他那黑而结实的劳动的手，紧握住指挥部同志的手，笑眯眯地说：“战争的时候，你们拿着枪杆子替老百姓打仗。胜利了，你们又参加大生产给老百姓打堤。你们真是毛主席领导的人民的好军队。”
