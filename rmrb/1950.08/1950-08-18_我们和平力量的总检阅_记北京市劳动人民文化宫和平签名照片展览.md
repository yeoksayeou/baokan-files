Our Grand Review of Peaceful Forces
    A Record of the Peace Signature Photo Exhibition at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace
    By Our Correspondent Liang Tian

    The China Peace Committee, starting yesterday (the 17th), held a photo exhibition of the peace signature movement in China and other countries under the shade trees in the front yard of the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace. Many workers, soldiers, government cadres, and citizens from all walks of life went to visit.

    The most prominent feature of the photo exhibition is a large red map showing the number of peace signatures from various countries: Europe and Asia, the Soviet Union and China, stand at the center of the world with the largest area and the largest number of signatures. Surrounding them are the numbers of seventy-three countries, large and small. In total, the number of people who signed the Stockholm Appeal is over 280 million. From the map, it can also be seen that many regions have not yet reported the number of signatures to the world. There are also many regions where mobilization is underway. This number, 280 million, is temporary. The number of people participating in the signature campaign worldwide must continue to increase and become a huge and invincible force.

    The first photo of the peace signature in China shows Chairman Mao writing his name. From Chairman Mao's solemn face, the Chinese people can see the confidence and strength of peace. He is the helmsman leading us towards lasting peace. The most people gathered in front of this photo.

    The peace signature photos from many regions in China are arranged in a semicircle. The banner of peace is flying, and the doves of peace are soaring in the sky. Workers are signing next to machines, soldiers are signing with weapons, and women are gathering around the signing table. Assemblies and demonstrations by tens of thousands of people... Here, the peace-loving force of the Chinese people is undergoing a grand review.

    There are quite a few peace signature photos from countries around the world. The situation in the Soviet Union is the most moving. In almost a month, more than 110 million people participated in the signing. We can see in the photos the Stakhanovite peace work teams working intensely, the members of the Soviet Peace Committee, and the various signatures of workers and peasants. The background of the huge peace posters created by artists is huge blast furnaces or tall cultural buildings and collective farms. Crowds of people are gathering everywhere to sign!

    In Free Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and other countries, the peace signature work has been successfully completed. In many people's democracies, almost all adults participated in the signing. Whether viewed from a corner or from a panorama, the photos in the exhibition give people the feeling that the power of peace is growing.

    At the entrance of the peace signature photo exhibition, the Stockholm Appeal is also hung. In just two hours yesterday afternoon, more than 300 people wrote their names in the signature book.

　　我们和平力量的总检阅
    记北京市劳动人民文化宫和平签名照片展览
    本报记者  梁田
    我国保卫世界和平委员会，昨（十七）日起在北京市劳动人民文化宫的前院树荫下，举办我国及世界各国的和平签名运动照片展览。工人、战士、机关干部及各界市民们，很多人去参观。
    照片展览中最突出的是一个标着各国和平签名数字的红色大地图：欧洲和亚洲，苏联和我国，以最大的面积和最多的签名人数，站在世界的中心。周围是七十三个大大小小的国家的数字。总计起来，在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数是两亿八千余万。从地图上还可以看出，仍有许多地区未向世界和大汇报签名人数。也还有许多地区正在发动中。这个数字，两亿八千万，是暂时的，全世界参加签名的人数一定要继续增涨，并且成为一支巨大的不可战胜的力量。
    我国和平签名照片的第一帧，是毛主席正在执笔写着自己的名字。从毛主席庄严的面孔上，中国人民看得见和平的信心和力量，这是我们走向持久和平的舵手。在这一帧照片前，围看的人最多。
    国内许多地区的和平签名照片陈列成一个半圆，和平的旗帜在飘扬，和平的鸽子在空中飞旋，工人们在机器旁边签字，战士们佩带着武器在签字，妇女们将签名的桌子围成一团，成千成万人们的集会和游行示威……，我们中国人民爱好和平的力量，在这里进行总检阅。
    世界各国的和平签名照片陈列的相当多。苏联的情形是最令人感动的。在差不多一个月中，一亿一千余万人参加了签名。我们可以在照片上看到紧张工作着的斯达哈诺夫式的和平工作班，苏联拥护和平委员会的委员们以及工人、农民的各式各样的签名。由艺术家创作的巨大的和平招贴画，背景是巨大的鼓风炉或高大的文化建筑物和集体农场，到处聚集着签名的人群！
    在自由德国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚等国，和平签名工作都已胜利的完成了。许多人民民主国家，几乎全数的成年人参加了签名。展览的照片，无论是从一个角落，或则从全景来看，都可以使人感到和平的力量在增涨。
    和平签名照片展览处的进口，还悬挂有斯德哥尔摩宣言，仅仅昨天下午的两个小时内，就有三百多人在签名簿上面写上了自己的名字。
