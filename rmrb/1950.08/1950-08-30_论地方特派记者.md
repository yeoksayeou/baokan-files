　　On Local Special Correspondents
    Gao Lielike
    I. Local Special Correspondents as Agents of Newspapers
    Local special correspondents of newspapers—these are staff members of a special department that we call the "local communications network." Readers can identify their dispatches from newspapers by the notation "Special Correspondent of this Newspaper."
    Behind this note lies enormous significance. This is the newspaper telling its readers that it has its own representative in a certain province or district. This is not a "passing" visitor, but a resident reporter who lives the life of that province or district.
    The newspaper seems to introduce the local special correspondent to the readers, saying: Before you stands my fully empowered representative, who connects me with your province, your district, and your life.
    On the other hand, the local special correspondent is like a representative of a certain province or district stationed at the newspaper. Like all staff members of the newspaper editorial department, the local special correspondent naturally lives the life of all the newspaper staff. However, there is an important difference in his position, namely, that he does not work in the city where the newspaper is published, but somewhere in another city or district. Therefore, we not only call the local special correspondent the representative of the newspaper stationed in a certain district, but also the representative of a certain district stationed at the newspaper.
    Since he is such a representative, his basic responsibility is to enable the newspaper editorial department to live the life of the districts he represents in the broadest possible way.
    The local special correspondent is not merely a reporter, and not merely a resident reporter. To put it more completely, he is the agent of the newspaper in a certain province or district.
    The agent of the newspaper! The mention of these words reminds one of the glorious predecessors of today's local special correspondents: the agents of Lenin's *Iskra* from 1900 to 1903, the agents of Stalin's *Struggle Newspaper*, and the reporters and organizers of *Pravda* from 1912 to 1914.
    Here we remember Ivan Vasilyevich Babushkin. Everyone called him the first worker correspondent, and there is good reason to call him the first local special correspondent of *Iskra*, the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist newspaper of all Russia.
    Lenin wrote: "As long as Ivan Vasilyevich is free, *Iskra* will not feel the lack of purely worker communications. Look at the first twenty issues of *Iskra*, all these communications come from Russia's Shui, Ivanov, Voznesensk, Orekhov, Zuyev, and other central locations in Russia: all this is almost entirely through the hands of Ivan Vasilyevich, who has worked to establish the closest link between *Iskra* and the workers. Ivan Vasilyevich is the most enthusiastic reporter of *Iskra* and its most ardent supporter." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 14, pp. 396-397)
    Thus, it can be seen that Lenin pointed out two aspects of Babushkin's activities: personally writing communications for *Iskra* and connecting *Iskra* with the workers and with the *Iskra* organizations that existed in various places at that time.
    These words of Lenin point out the current tasks of our local special correspondents. As we have said, these reporters are not merely reporters, but agents of the newspaper, organizers who connect the newspaper with local workers and with local Party and Soviet public (this connection is of utmost importance to the newspaper).
    The genius chief editor of *Iskra* taught the newspaper's agents in Russia to learn these things. For example, Lenin wrote in a letter to Babushkin on January 6, 1903:
    "Has it been tried to increase the communications from Peter (i.e., Petrograd—translator) tenfold?" (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 28, p. 159)
    Lenin pointed this out to I.D. Stasova again on January 28, 1903: "Workers' communications from Peter are very much needed, please try to get more." (Lenin's Complete Works, p. 171)
    Lenin said in a letter to I.I. Radchenko on July 16, 1902:
    "...Get your worker group, and get Manya (Manya refers to the secret title of the committee of worker organizations existing in St. Petersburg at that time – Gao Lielike Note) to contact us directly: this is very important, it can greatly consolidate their closeness to *Iskra*, and can also consolidate your position among them." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 28, p. 142)
    Lenin said in a letter to the Kharkov Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party on January 15, 1903:
    "...Establish an organic connection between the newspaper editorial department and local workers." (Lenin's Complete Works, Vol. 28, p. 163)
    Lenin's many letters to *Iskra*'s agents are extremely valuable contributions to the theory and practice of Bolshevik newspaper work organization in general, and to the practice of newspaper communications network organization in particular.
    It is not enough for the local special correspondent to make people know him from the places signed on the newspaper. He should make people know that he is a staff member of such a newspaper editorial department: who can always talk to him about local life problems, communication problems, and can get the necessary help, advice, and instructions from him.
    Kalinin said to the local special correspondent of the *Socialist Agriculture Newspaper* in 1938: "If the people in the province do not know you are a reporter, that is not right. People should know you. You should not be confined to your own world." (*Collection of Bolshevik Newspapers and Periodicals*, Part 2, p. 308, National Political Publishing House, 1945)
    Knowing the local special correspondent means knowing him from the communications in the newspaper and from his great organizational work. The work of the local special correspondent cannot be separated. It should even be strongly emphasized that the organizational element in the work of the local special correspondent.
    Take the "Decision on the Work of the Local Special Correspondent of the *Northern Worker Newspaper* in Yaroslavl Province" promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on June 2, 1938 as an example. Note how the Central Committee emphasized the organizational role of the local special correspondent. The Central Committee's decision called the phenomenon of the *Northern Worker Newspaper*'s local special correspondent disconnecting from local activists one of the most serious shortcomings in the *Northern Worker Newspaper*'s local special correspondent's work.
    The decision said: "The reporter of the *Northern Worker Newspaper* has not organized the activists among the newspaper's readers around himself, has not carried out systematic work on worker and peasant correspondents, and has not absorbed Party activists to become contributors to the newspaper." (*Collection of Party Decisions on Newspapers and Periodicals*, p. 171, 1941 edition)
    The "Decision on the Staff of Provincial, Border Region, and Republic Newspapers" promulgated by the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on July 25, 1940, also quite definitely stipulated this task.
    "The basic task of local special correspondents should be considered to be to organize a broad mass of author activists outside the editorial department around the newspaper, and to absorb workers from Party organizations, Soviet organizations, and economic organizations, Soviet intellectuals, worker correspondents, and peasant correspondents to participate in the work." (*Collection of Party Decisions on Newspapers and Periodicals*, p. 193, 1941 edition)
    "Basic task"—these words fully illustrate the significance of the organizational work of local special correspondents to the newspaper editorial department.
    Comrade Stalin wrote in the article *The Newspaper is a Collective Organizer*:
    "If a popular newspaper like *Poor Peasants' Newspaper* sometimes convenes a meeting of the main agents of the newspaper stationed in various parts of our country, in order to exchange opinions and summarize experiences, and each agent himself convenes a meeting of correspondents in his region, locality, and township for the same purpose—then not only in establishing organizational relations between the Party and the working class, between the government and the most remote corners of our country, but also in improving and strengthening the newspaper itself, and improving and strengthening the entire staff of our periodicals, a top priority has been completed. In my opinion, such a meeting is far more realistic than convening an 'All-Russian' and other journalists' congresses." (Stalin's Complete Works, Vol. 5, p. 283)
    Of course, Comrade Stalin's instruction is still of great significance to the work of correspondents of local newspapers.
    The organizational work of local special correspondents will not in the least reduce the significance of his personal writing.
    The local special correspondent should write, he should write his thoughts, his creations, and the results of his research. He should write about what he has studied and is familiar with. But this does not mean that everything should be written by himself.
    "The editorial department gives me a lot of tasks. Why order me not to write everything again?" Many reporters sometimes ask this.
    "I am very busy completing the various tasks given by the editorial department, I don't have time to 'interact' with activists." Some local special correspondents say.
    We should answer these comrades.
    Indeed, local special correspondents usually receive many tasks from the editorial department. This is very natural. Because every department of the newspaper has the right to expect its resident reporter to send materials on the issues of that department. But the local special correspondent does not have to write all the tasks he undertakes entirely by himself. The tasks of the editorial department should be completed partly by himself, and partly by the help of the author activists organized locally outside the editorial department.
    The local special correspondent should know everything most important and most meaningful that happens in his province, district, and in all sectors of socialist construction. Whether it is the situation in this or that industrial enterprise, the work of a certain collective farm, the new book published by the local publishing bureau, the new performance in the theater, etc.—this is everything that the local special correspondent should care about.
    Caring about everything means interacting with the broadest classes of people, and having a broad network of contacts that can continuously supply the newspaper with situations, news, and news from all corners of the province and district.
    The local special correspondent should give the newspaper rich and diverse materials about local life. Therefore, he should work in such a way that these materials are continuously sent to it from various places. That is to say, hundreds of people need to help the local special correspondent to carry out this work, rather than all the materials should be collected by himself.
    The local special correspondent should guarantee to report to the newspaper in a timely manner the process of economic and political movements, criticize backward phenomena, and praise advanced phenomena. It is incorrect if the local special correspondent attempts to write all the manuscripts himself.
    The local special correspondent may not write a review of the new program staged by the local theater himself. But he can watch the staged drama, talk to experts about the merits and demerits of the performance, and ask them to write a review for the newspaper.
    The local special correspondent may not write about the meaningful experience of a certain Party organization himself, but he should know this experience from the Party activists he is in contact with. And this experience can be written and summarized by authors outside the editorial department.
    The various responsibilities of the local special correspondent as the agent of the newspaper should not be split. Personally writing communications for the newspaper, organizing author activists outside the editorial department, reporting local work to the editorial department—all these are what the local special correspondent should combine in his daily work. Only a local special correspondent who combines in this way can become a perfect local special correspondent.
    Organizational work can also enrich writing work, and vice versa, the reporter's active writing work can also promote close interaction with people, and arouse more interest in understanding, knowledge, observation, and research. For example, if the local special correspondent is fascinated by his own writing and deviates from the local activists, then he will lose his qualifications as a journalist, and the result will be old-fashioned clichés, empty words, and a standstill in writing. If a reporter stops writing, then the fate of becoming a "writing work instructor" who can only revise manuscripts and cannot write manuscripts is waiting for him.
    In short, the responsibility of the local special correspondent is, on the one hand, to write, and on the other hand, as Lenin once said, to organize the activists in the province and district to write for the newspaper.
  II. Communication Writing
    (Editor's note: This section is more than 20,000 words long and has been incorporated into the *Journalism Series*, so it is omitted)
  III. Local Special Correspondents and Author Activists Outside the Editorial Department
    As we have said, organizational work is one of the most important duties of local special correspondents. Local special correspondents should supply their newspapers with communications, essays, and short essays by local activists, worker and peasant correspondents, and intellectuals. Local special correspondents should help authors write good, informative communications.
    We strongly advise local special correspondents not to do this mechanically and formally: after agreeing to write an essay or communication with local workers, they should immediately send it to the editorial department as soon as they receive it, regardless of "how it works" there.
    Here is a typical example. A local special correspondent sent an article written by a local activist to the newspaper, which was not satisfactory in content. The editorial department did not publish this article. What is the point of sending such an article to the editorial department? It turned out that the mistake in the poor article was not with the author, but with the local special correspondent. Because he viewed the work of forwarding articles by authors outside the editorial department very formally.
    Indeed, this local special correspondent did not jointly study the essay with the author in terms of the essay's ideas, its plan, or its conclusions, but hastily agreed to the manuscript. But the author had not yet had the experience of writing for the newspaper, and he was not good at briefly and compactly describing his thoughts and his experience in the format of essays and communications. So the author wrote it at will.
    The editorial department did not adopt this essay. The author waited anxiously. He asked the local special correspondent several times: "Have you heard anything about my essay?" The local special correspondent avoided saying: "I don't know either, let me ask the editorial department." An unpleasant answer finally came. When the local special correspondent met the author again, he said: "Your article will not be published, the editorial department did not use it." The local special correspondent thought that this would enable him to "get rid of" the predicament.
    No, he did not leave the predicament, and the author was dissatisfied with the representative of the editorial department. He said: "The local special correspondent made a fool of me." This author had a reason.
    When the local special correspondent forwards the essays of his activists to the editorial department, he should not regard himself as a "transfer station." When he sends out the essay, he should treat this essay like the group leader of the editorial department, like the writer who is preparing to publish this essay, like the editor-in-chief who decides the evaluation of this essay, and finally, like the reader.
    In order to make the essays of authors outside the editorial department well written, first, it is necessary to correctly select the author. That is to say, to find someone who knows the topic well, is interested in it, and can write the essay with a proficient attitude.
    Second, it is necessary to jointly discuss and study the topic with the author, and study with him how to record it in the communication and from which aspect to write the topic.
    The following excerpt from Krupskaya's account of how Lenin worked with the author in *Iskra* is very meaningful.
    "Vladimir Ilyich determined that this or that author was suitable for writing such and such an essay. But he did not immediately ask him to write it, but first talked to this comrade about the issues involved in this topic, and discussed it in detail. Vladimir Ilyich elaborated and clarified this theme from all aspects. Then Ilyich suddenly proposed: 'You write about this issue, you will write it well.' So this comrade wrote it, and what he wrote was often Vladimir Ilyich's opinion."
    Krupskaya said that the success of this type of essay lies in:
    "Before entrusting the author to write this essay, Vladimir Ilyich talked about this topic with the author for a long time... Although the essay was written by the author, the research and discussion were conducted jointly."
    What a vivid and educational example this is for every newspaper worker!
    Being able and willing to "hang out" with the author, jointly selecting and thinking about the topic well, discussing the topic, formulating a writing outline, and suggesting an easy-to-understand and easy-to-accept form of essay communication—this is what is required of local special correspondents when working with author activists and worker and peasant correspondents outside the editorial department.
    If an incorrect and formal attitude is adopted towards the author when agreeing to write an essay or communication, then the phenomenon of the local special correspondent writing the essay instead of the author should be regarded as an extremely rude and unacceptable mistake. This is incompatible with the traditions and principles of Bolshevik newspapers.
    The newspaper and its readers need the authors to write articles themselves. Its value lies in the fact that they understand the issues they write about, they themselves have the experience of selecting and proposing topics, analyzing topics, and being good at expressing their own thoughts. It is not allowed to replace the author's writing assistance with the newspaper worker's overstepping of his duties—cooperating with the author. Writing assistance is a noble job that arises directly from the responsibilities of newspaper workers. Helping the author write for the newspaper means helping the author with your own writing experience and your own writing habits (writing proficiency).
    Special mention should also be made of the most important aspect of working with author activists. We have said that the special correspondent's responsibility is to provide the newspaper with new issues by using various methods to promote the author's creative initiative. But the issue should be raised in such a way that the newspaper's activists do not and do not always have to wait to agree to write on designated topics. The newspaper needs essays and communications on various topics proposed by the masses of author activists and worker and peasant correspondents outside the editorial department. New issues often emerge in local life and local experience. Therefore, the editorial department cannot only predict according to its own plans and its own views. What the editorial department should evaluate for authors outside the editorial department and worker and peasant correspondents is their sensitivity, their sense of new things, their knowledge of life, and their ability to suggest to the newspaper the various topics it needs. That is why, in addition to asking the author "Are you going to write about this topic?", one should also often ask this question: "What other topics can you write about?"
  IV. Editorial Department's Leadership of Local Special Correspondents
    The activities of local special correspondents are not in the central organ of the editorial department. He does not often "appear" in the editorial department. Therefore, it is especially necessary to prevent the slightest disconnect between the editorial department and the local special correspondent. In the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "Decision on the Work of the Local Special Correspondent of the *Northern Worker Newspaper* in Yaroslavl Province," it was pointed out that the importance of all the work of the local special correspondent should not be underestimated. The Party Central Committee rebuked the phenomenon of the "erroneous attitude of regarding one's own reporter as a secondary and insignificant link in the work organization of the newspaper" that occurred in some editorial departments. This decision also rebuked the phenomenon of disregard for the newspaper's local correspondent network, which resulted in their work falling into spontaneity.
    I say again, the local special correspondent is not in the central organ of the editorial department. Therefore, it is even more necessary to make him feel every day and every hour that he is a member of all the staff of the editorial department. Therefore, the editorial department even more needs to study such a way and method of working with local special correspondents, such a way and method of contacting them, and such a way of combining them, so that local special correspondents completely live the life of the editorial department and are familiar with its daily work. This is the "key" to leading local special correspondents.
    But what is the way to contact local special correspondents?
    First, it is to make the local special correspondent understand the editorial department's plan, understand the various twists and turns that often accompany the editorial department's work, understand the instructions the editorial department receives from the Party's leading organs, and understand the work guidelines of the central, republic, border region, and provincial organs and groups.
    Second, it is necessary to formulate detailed work plans for each local special correspondent and future plans for his work in the local area. The local special correspondent should formulate a plan for himself on the issues he intends to expound in the newspaper, and a plan for absorbing authors and worker and peasant correspondents to carry out organizational work. The Party Central Committee specifically pointed out in the "Decision on the Work of the Local Special Correspondent of the *Northern Worker Newspaper* in Yaroslavl Province" that the editorial department has the responsibility to normally regulate the work plan of the local special correspondent. The local special correspondent's personal plan is also very valuable to the newspaper's plan, and it will suggest new topics to the editorial department.
    One of the most important ways to lead local special correspondents is to check the local special correspondent's manuscripts on time, and point out their shortcomings and the reasons why a certain communication was not adopted. Therefore, the Party Central Committee's decision specifically pointed out this way of leading local special correspondents.
    For example, the editorial department of *Pravda* sent many critical letters to its local special correspondents, in which it specifically analyzed their works. The authors who wrote the critical letters were all responsible staff members of the editorial department, and the one who organized this work was the local correspondent network department. The critics kept all the manuscripts sent by the local special correspondents in a thick paper clip. This made it possible for the critics to see the strengths and weaknesses of the reporter's work.
    As the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) said, it is necessary to convene local special correspondents to the editorial department on time, as the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) said, "in order to instruct and improve the quality of the newspaper." The Party Central Committee stipulated that local special correspondents should be convened—at least once every three months.
    Let's talk more about the significant experience of the editorial department of *Pravda* in establishing regular contact with local special correspondents. The local special correspondent—usually individually—makes a regular work report at the editorial committee. Here, the local special correspondent reports on the work situation in the province, how he expounds on the life of the province, and how he attracts local activists to participate in the newspaper's work. Here, the editorial department listens to the local special correspondent's "requests" to the editorial department, and the editorial department criticizes the local special correspondent and guides the local special correspondent according to the editorial department's plan and current tasks. The significance of similar convocations of local special correspondents to make reports lies in the fact that local special correspondents enable the editorial department to lead local special correspondents more correctly, and to consider the working conditions of local special correspondents in the province.
    The meetings of local special correspondents should be held separately in certain areas. Such meetings should be held locally. For example, the editorial department of *Pravda* convened two meetings of local special correspondents from various provinces in Ukraine in Kiev. The editorial committee of *Pravda* specifically sent its members to preside over these meetings.
    The special correspondents who are sent out to perform the special tasks of the editorial department also provide considerable help to the local special correspondents. The special correspondents absorb the local special correspondents of *Pravda* to participate in their work, often jointly complete the editorial department's entrustment with them, jointly write communications, and hold meetings with activists, etc.
    Correctly assigning tasks to local special correspondents is of great organizational and educational significance. How the reporter completes the task and what the level of his essays and communications depends on how each such task is researched, formulated, and explained.
    When the editorial department proposes its own tasks, it is often hasty, urgent, and does not consider how the local special correspondent understands this or that entrustment. When the editorial department entrusts the reporter to report on a certain issue, it must make clear what the editorial department's intention at that time is included in this task. It must make this task able to suggest to the reporter the editorial department's attitude towards this topic and the desired form of reporting.
    If you wish, then the task is also a school for local special correspondents. If the editorial department points out to the reporters the political and business significance of the issues raised, and arranges work according to their situation, then the task is a daily, regular, and regular form of contact between the editorial department and the reporters.
    Urgent instructions should not be abused. It should be considered in a timely manner what kind of entrustment to give to what kind of local special correspondent, so that he has the time and possibility to study the issue in depth, to do his best, not carelessly, nor superficially, but to write skillfully. And it should be considered the preferences and expertise of individual local special correspondents: that is, this reporter is stronger in some aspects, and that reporter is more interested in this issue than another reporter.
    It is also very important to make the realization of the task not hinder the reporter's creative initiative to raise local issues in the newspaper. The editorial department often breaks the reporter's love of automatically finding and selecting new meaningful topics. This phenomenon mostly occurs when the editorial department only publishes the communications of the topics it has "booked", and when the communications of the local special correspondent or activist go beyond the editorial department's plan, they are not valued and cannot be published.
    The newspaper's responsibility is to inspire and encourage local special correspondents and activists outside the editorial department by various methods not only to write according to the task, but also to promote creative initiative, and to write the topics they have found and studied themselves.

　　论地方特派记者
    高烈里克
    一  作为报纸代理人的地方特派记者
    报纸的地方特派记者——这是被我们叫做“地方通讯网”的一个特殊部门的工作人员，读者可以从报纸上注有“本报特派记者”的地方辨别出他们的通讯来。
    在这个附注后面，隐藏着巨大的意义。这就是报纸告诉读者，它在某省、某区里有着自己的代表，这不是“过路”客，而是常驻的记者，他就是以这一省、这一区的生活为生活的。
    报纸仿佛介绍地方特派记者给读者说：在你面前有着我的全权代表，他是把我和你省、你区以及你的生活联系在一起的。
    另一方面，地方特派记者仿佛是某省、某区驻在报纸方面的代表。如同报纸编辑部机构的一切工作人员一样，地方特派记者当然也是以报纸全体人员的生活为生活的。但是，在他的地位上也有着重要的不同，就是说，他不是在出版报纸的那个城市里，而是在别的城市或者区里的什么地方工作的。所以我们不但把地方特派记者称为驻在某一个区里的报纸的代表，而且也把他称为驻在报纸方面的某区的代表。
    既然他是这样的代表，那么他的基本的职责便是，使报纸编辑部有最广泛的可能以他所代表的那些区的生活为生活。
    地方特派记者，并不单单是记者，并且也并不单单是常驻记者，说得意义完整些，他是报纸在某省、某区的代理人。
    报纸的代理人！提到这几个字，就使人想起现在的地方特派记者的光荣的先辈们：一九○○年——一九○三年列宁的《火星报》的代理人，斯大林的《斗争报》的代理人，一九一二——一九一四年的《真理报》的记者和组织者。
    在这里我们想起伊凡·瓦西里维奇·巴布什金。大家称他为第一名工人通讯员，并且也有充分根据可以称他为全俄罗斯的革命马列主义者的《火星报》的第一名地方特派记者。
    列宁写道：“只要伊瓦·瓦西里维奇还自由，《火星报》就不会感到纯工人通讯的不足。请看看《火星报》前二十期吧，所有这些通讯都是从俄国苏伊、伊凡诺夫、伏兹涅森斯克、奥列赫夫、祖耶夫以及俄罗斯其他的中心地点来的：这一切几乎都是经过伊凡·瓦西里维奇之手，他曾努力使《火星报》与工人之间建立最密切的联系。伊凡·瓦西里维奇是《火星报》最热心的记者和它最热诚的拥护者。”（列宁全集第十四卷第三九六——三九七页）
    因此，可以看出，列宁指出了巴布什金活动的两个方面：个人给《火星报》写通讯和使《火星报》与工人们、与当时存在于各地的《火星报》组织发生联系。
    列宁的这些话，给我们指出了我们的地方特派记者们的当前任务。我们已经说过，这些记者并不单单是记者，而是报纸的代理人，是使报纸与地方工作者、与地方党的和苏维埃的公众发生联系的组织者（这种联系对于报纸何等重要）。
    《火星报》的天才的主编教导该报驻俄国各地的代理人学习的正是这些。例如，列宁于一九○三年一月六日给巴布什金的信中写道：
    “是否已设法使得从彼得（即彼得格勒——译者）来的通讯增加十倍。”（列宁全集第二十八卷第一五九页）
    列宁于一九○三年一月二十八日又把这件事情向依·德·斯塔索娃指出：“对于通讯，彼得的工人是非常需要的，请你多多争取。”（列宁全集第一七一页）
    列宁于一九○二年七月十六日给依·依·拉得琴哥的信中说道：
    “……使你的工人小组，并使曼尼亚（按“曼尼亚”——系指当时在彼得堡存在的工人组织的委员会的秘密称号——高烈里克注）和我们直接取得联系：这是非常重要的，既可以大大巩固他们与《火星报》的接近，也可以巩固您在他们中间的地位。”（列宁全集第二十八卷第一四二页）
    列宁于一九○三年一月十五日给俄罗斯社会民主工党哈尔科夫委员会的信中说道：
    “……建立报纸编辑部和地方工作者的……有机的联系。”（列宁全集第二十八卷第一六三页）
    列宁给《火星报》代理人的许多信，一般地对于布尔什维克报纸工作组织的理论与实践，特别对于报纸通讯网组织的实践，都是极其宝贵的贡献。
    如果地方特派记者只使人们从报纸上署名的地方知道他，那是不够的。他应当使人们知道他是这样一个报纸编辑部的工作人员：永远能和他谈论地方生活问题、通讯问题，并且能从他得到必要的帮助、建议和指示。
    加里宁于一九三八年曾向《社会主义农业报》的地方特派记者说：“如果该省的人不知道你是记者，那是不对的。应当使人民知道你。你不应该固步自封。”（《布尔什维克报刊》文集，第二部第三○八页，国家政治出版局出版，一九四五年）
    所谓知道地方特派记者，就是从报纸上的通讯中以及从他的巨大的组织工作中知道他。地方特派记者的工作是不能一一分开的。甚至应当大力强调地方特派记者工作中的组织的要素。
    试举联共（布）党中央委员会于一九三八年六月二日颁布的《关于雅罗斯拉夫省〈北方工人报〉地方特派记者的工作》的决定为例。请注意中央委员会是如何强调指出地方特派记者的组织作用的。中央委员会的决定正就是把《北方工人报》地方特派记者与当地积极分子脱节的现象称之为《北方工人报》地方特派记者工作中最严重的缺点之一。
    该决定说：“《北方工人报》记者没有把报纸读者中的积极分子组织在自己周围，没有对工农通讯员进行有系统的工作，没有吸收党的积极分子成为报纸的撰稿人。”（《党关于报刊的决议》汇编，一七一页，一九四一年版）
    联共（布）党中央委员会于一九四○年七月二十五日颁布的《关于省、边疆和共和国的报纸工作人员》的决定，也相当肯定地规定了这个任务。
    “地方特派记者的基本任务，应认为是把编辑部以外的广大作者积极分子组织在报纸周围，吸收党组织、苏维埃组织和经济组织的工作人员、苏维埃知识分子、工人通讯员和农民通讯员参加工作。”（《党关于报刊的决议》汇编，一九三页，一九四一年版）
    “基本任务”——这几个字就完全说明：地方特派记者的组织工作对报纸编辑部说来是具有何等意义。
    斯大林同志曾在《报纸是集体的组织者》一文中写道：
    “假如像《贫农报》这样的通俗报纸，有时召开该报驻在我国各地的主要代理人的会议，以便交换意见和总结经验，而每个代理人自己也为了同一目的而召开本区、本地和本乡的通讯员会议，——那么不仅在建立党与工人阶级之间、政府与我国最偏僻的角落之间的组织关系方面，而且在改进和加强报纸本身、改进和加强我国期刊的全体工作人员方面，都因而完成了头等重要的步骤。据我看来，这样的会议远比召开‘全俄’和其他新闻工作者代表大会更富有现实的意义。”（斯大林全集第五卷第二八三页）
    当然，斯大林同志的这个指示，直到现在，对各地报纸通讯员的工作说来，还是具有重大意义的。
    地方特派记者的组织工作丝毫不会减轻他亲自写作的意义的。
    地方特派记者是应当写作的，他应当写他的思想、他的创造和他的研究的结果。他应当写他所研究过而熟知的东西。但是这完全不是说，一切都应当由他自己去写。
    “编辑部给我很多任务。怎么又命令我不要一切都写呢？”许多记者有时会这样问。
    “我为完成编辑部给的各项任务而感到非常忙碌，我没有时间去和积极分子‘来往’啊。”有些地方特派记者说。
    我们应当答复这些同志。
    确实，地方特派记者通常要接到编辑部很多的任务。这是很自然的。因为报纸的每一部门都有权期望自己的常驻记者寄来有关该部门的问题的材料。但是地方特派记者不必把他所担当的任务完全由自己去写。编辑部的任务，一方面要靠自己，另一方面也要靠在当地组织起来的编辑部以外的作者积极分子的帮助来完成。
    地方特派记者应该知道在他的省内、区内和社会主义建设的各地段内发生的一切最重要和最有意义的事情。无论是这个或那个工业企业中的状况，某个集体农庄的工作，地方出版局出版的新书，剧场的新的演出等等，——就是地方特派记者所应当关心的一切。
    所谓关心一切，就是说要和最广泛的阶层的人们来往，要有能以该省、该区各角落的情况、消息和新闻源源不断供给报纸的广大的联络网。
    地方特派记者应当给报纸以丰富而多样的关于地方生活的材料。因此他应当这样进行工作，以便使这些材料从各地向它源源寄来。也就是说，需要有数百人帮助地方特派记者来进行这件工作，而不是一切材料都应当由他亲自搜集。
    地方特派记者应当保证向报纸及时报道经济政治运动的过程，批评落后现象，表扬先进现象。如果地方特派记者企图由自己包写一切稿件，那是不正确的。
    地方特派记者自己可以不写关于当地剧院上演新节目的评论。但他可以看看上演的戏剧，并与内行人谈谈演出的优劣，请他们给报纸写评论。
    地方特派记者自己可以不写某一党组织的有意义的经验，但是他应当从他所联系的党的积极分子方面知道这个经验。而且可以由编辑部以外的作者去写出和总结这个经验。
    不应该分裂作为报纸代理人的地方特派记者的各种不同的职责。个人要给报纸写通讯，组织编辑部以外的作者积极分子，向编辑部报道当地工作情况——这一切都是地方特派记者应当在自己日常工作中结合起来的。只有这样结合的地方特派记者才能成为一个完美的地方特派记者。
    组织工作也可以充实文字工作，反之，记者的积极的文字工作也可以促进与人们的密切来往，引起更多了解、见闻、观察和研究的兴趣。譬如，如果地方特派记者着迷于自己的写作而脱离当地的积极分子的话，那么他将失去作为一个新闻工作者的资格，结果写出来的都将是老生常谈，空洞无物，而且在文字方面也停止进展了，如果一个记者停止写作的话，那么变成只会改稿、不会写稿的“文字工作指导者”的命运便在等待着他了。
    总而言之，地方特派记者的责任，一方面是写作，另一方面正如列宁所曾说过的是组织本省、本区的积极分子给报纸写稿。
  二  通讯写作
    （编者按：此节长二万余字，已编入《新闻工作丛书》，故略）
  三  地方特派记者和编辑部以外的作者积极分子工作
    正如我们所说过的一样，组织工作是地方特派记者最重要职务之一。地方特派记者应当以当地积极分子、工农通讯员和知识分子的通讯、论文和短论供给自己的报纸。地方特派记者应当帮助作者写出好的、能说明问题的通讯。
    我们坚决劝告地方特派记者不要机械地、形式地来作这件事情：向地方工作人员约定了论文或通讯以后，一接到它就马上寄给编辑部，不管在那里“收效如何”。
    这是一个典型的例子。有一个地方特派记者把地方积极分子所写的内容不能令人满意的文章寄给报社。编辑部没有登这篇文章。把这样的一篇文章寄给编辑部来有什么意思呢？结果才知道文章不好的错处不在作者，而在地方特派记者身上。因为他把转寄编辑部以外作者的文章的工作看得很形式。
    确实，这位地方特派记者无论是在论文的思想方面，它的计划方面或它的结论方面，都没有与作者共同研究，就匆匆地约定了稿件。可是作者还没有给报纸写稿的经验，他还不善于照论文和通讯的格式简短地、压缩地叙述自己的思想，自己的经验。于是作者就信手写了。
    编辑部没采用这篇论文。作者等得很焦急。他几次地问这位地方特派记者：“你听到了什么没有，关于我的论文？”地方特派记者避开说：“我也不知道，待我问问编辑部吧。”不愉快的回答终于来到了。地方特派记者再与作者见面时说：“您的文章不登了，编辑部没有用它。”地方特派记者以为这样就可以使自己“摆脱”了窘境。
    不，他并没有离开窘境，作者对编辑部的代表是不满意的。他说：“地方特派记者作弄我。”这位作者是有理由的。
    当地方特派记者向编辑部转寄自己的积极分子的论文时，他不应将自己当做“转送站”。当他寄出论文的时候，应当像编辑部的组长、像准备把这篇论文登出的文字工作者、像决定这篇论文的评价的主编，最后，应当像读者那样地来对待这篇论文。
    为使编辑部以外的作者的论文写得好，第一，必需正确地挑选作者。这就是说要寻找很好知道这个题目的、对它发生兴趣的并能以精通这个题目的态度去写论文的人。
    第二，必需与作者共同讨论和研究这个题目，与他研究应如何在通讯中记述和从那一方面来写这个题目。
    下面引证的克鲁普斯卡亚关于列宁在《火星报》如何与作者进行工作的一段话，是很有意义的。
    “乌拉基米尔·伊里奇认定这个或那个作者适于写某某一篇论文。但他并不立刻提出要他写，却首先与这位同志谈这个题目所涉及的问题，并详详细细地讨论它。乌拉基米尔·伊里奇从各方面发挥并阐明这主题。然后伊里奇突然提议：‘你来写写这问题吧，你是会写得好的。’于是这位同志就写了，而且写出来的常常是乌拉基米尔·伊里奇的意见。”
    克鲁普斯卡亚说，这种论文的成功在于：
    “在委托作者写这篇论文之前，乌拉基米尔·伊里奇就长时间地和作者谈论这个题目……论文虽然是作者写的，但研究和讨论却是共同进行的。”
    这对每个报纸工作者是一个何等鲜明而富有教育意义的例子！
    能够并愿意与作者去“泡”，与他共同选择并很好地想题目，讨论题目，制订写作大纲，提示一个容易了解和容易接受的论文通讯的形式——这就是对地方特派记者与编辑部以外的作者积极分子和工农通讯员进行工作时所要求的。
    如果在约写论文或通讯时，对作者采取了不正确的、形式的态度，那么应当把地方特派记者代替作者写论文的现象认为是极粗鲁而不能容许的错误。这是与布尔什维克报纸的传统和原则水火不相容的。
    报纸和它的读者需要作者自己动手写文章。其价值就在于他们了解所写的问题，他们自己有经验进行选择和提出题目、分析题目并善于表达自己的思想。不许以报纸工作者越俎代庖的方式来代替对作者的写作辅助——与作者合作。写作辅助乃是直接从报纸工作者的责任中产生出来的、高贵的工作。帮助作者给报纸写稿，这就是说，以自己的写作经验、以自己的写作习惯（文字熟练）来帮助作者。
    还应当特别谈到与作者积极分子进行工作时的最重要的一方面。我们说过特派记者的责任是用各种方法发挥作者的创造的主动性给报纸提供新的问题。但问题应该这样提出，即使报纸的积极分子不必而且也不用总是等待约定他写作指定的题目。报纸需要编辑部以外的积极分子、工农通讯员群众所提出的各种题材的论文和通讯。在地方生活和地方经验中常常涌现出新的问题。因此编辑部就不能只按照自己的计划和自己的看法去预计。编辑部对编辑部以外的作者和工农通讯员所应评价的正是他们的敏感、新鲜事物的感觉、生活知识和善于给报纸提示所需要的各种题材。这就是为什么除了向作者提出“你是不是写一写这个题目”以外，也应当经常地提出这样问题：“你还能写些什么样的题目？”
  四  编辑部对地方特派记者的领导
    地方特派记者的活动不在编辑部的中心机关里。他不常“出现”在编辑部。因此要特别防止编辑部与地方特派记者有些微的脱节现象。在联共（布）党中央委员会《关于雅罗斯拉夫省〈北方工人报〉地方特派记者的工作》的决定中曾指出，对地方特派记者的一切工作的重要性，不容许过低估计。党中央委员会斥责了某些编辑部所发生的“把自己的记者当作报社工作机构中次要的、意义不大的一环的错误态度”的现象。这个决定还斥责了对报纸地方通讯员网的不管不顾的现象，由于不管不顾的结果，使他们的工作陷入了自流。
    我再说一遍，地方特派记者不是在编辑部中心机关里。因此更需要使他每天地和每时地都感觉自己是编辑部全体人员中间一个成员。因此编辑部更其需要研究对地方特派记者的这样一种工作方式和方法，这样一种联系的方式和方法以及这样一种结合的方法，以便地方特派记者完全过着编辑部的生活并熟习它的日常工作。这就是领导地方特派记者的《关键》之所在。
    但是，与地方特派记者联系的方式是怎样的呢？
    首先，这就是使地方特派记者了解编辑部的计划，了解那经常伴随编辑部工作而来的各种曲折和转变，了解编辑部从党的领导机关所得到的指示，了解中央的、共和国的、边疆的，省的机关和团体的工作方针。
    其次，必需详细制订每个地方特派记者的工作计划和他在当地工作的未来计划。地方特派记者应当为自己制订他打算在报纸上阐明的那些问题的计划，吸收作者和工农通讯员进行组织工作的计划。党中央委员会在《关于雅罗斯拉夫省〈北方工人报〉地方特派记者的工作》的决定中曾特别指出编辑部有责任正常地规定地方特派记者的工作计划。地方特派记者的个人计划，对报社的计划来说，也是很宝贵的，它将为编辑部提示新的题材。
    领导地方特派记者的最重要的方式之一，就是按时地检查地方特派记者的稿件，并指出其缺点以及某篇通讯未被采用的原因。因此在党中央委员会的决定中就特别指出了这个领导地方特派记者的方式。
    例如，《真理报》编辑部给自己的地方特派记者寄出许多批评性的信件，在信中具体地分析他们的作品。写批评性信件的作者都是编辑部的负责的工作人员，而组织这个工作的则是地方通讯员网部。批评者用一个厚纸夹保存着地方特派记者寄来的一切稿件。这就使得批评者有可能看到该记者的工作的优点和缺点。
    正如联共（布）党中央委员会的决议中所说的一样，必需按时的召集地方特派记者到编辑部来，如像联共（布）党中央委员会的决议所说的一样，“为了指示和提高报纸的质量”。党中央委员会规定召集地方特派记者——至少每三个月一次。
    再谈一谈关于《真理报》编辑部对与地方特派记者建立经常联系的具有重大意义的经验。地方特派记者——通常是个别的——在编委会上作定期的工作报告。在这里，地方特派记者报告本省的工作情况、他如何阐明该省的生活以及如何吸引地方积极分子参加报纸工作。在这里编辑部听取地方特派记者对编辑部的“要求”，而编辑部向地方特派记者作批评，并根据编辑部的计划和当前任务来指导地方特派记者。类似的召集地方特派记者作报告的意义就在于地方特派记者使编辑部能够更正确地领导地方特派记者，和考虑地方特派记者在该省的工作条件。
    地方特派记者的会议要在一定的地区内分别举行。应当就地举行这种会议。例如，《真理报》编辑部曾在基辅召集乌克兰各省的地方特派记者的两次会议。《真理报》编委会特别派出了它的委员主持这些会议。
    为了执行编辑部的特别任务而被派出的特派记者，对地方特派记者也有相当的帮助，特派记者吸收《真理报》的地方特派记者参加自己的工作，经常和他们共同完成编辑部的委托，共同写通讯以及与积极分子举行会议等等。
    正确地给地方特派记者分配任务，是具有重大的组织和教育意义的。记者怎样完成任务以及他的论文和通讯的水平如何，这都取决于每个这样的任务是如何被研究、制订和解释的。
    编辑部在提出自己的任务的时候，常常是匆忙、紧迫、没有考虑地方特派记者对这个或那个委托的理解如何。当编辑部委托记者报道某个问题时，必须使这个任务所包括的编辑部在当时的意图是明确的。必须使这个任务能够向记者提示编辑部对这个题目的态度和所希望的报道形式。
    假如你愿意的话，那么，任务同时也就是地方特派记者的学校，如果编辑部向记者指出所提问题的政治上的和业务上的意义，并根据他们的情况来布置工作，那么任务就是编辑部与记者每日的、经常的和正规的联系形式。
    不应当滥发紧急指示。应当及时考虑到把什么样的委托给与什么样的地方特派记者，以便使他有时间并有可能去深入研究问题，用尽全力，既不潦草，也不浮面，而是熟练地去写作。并且应当考虑到个别地方特派记者的喜好和专长：即在某方面这个记者要强些，那一个记者对这个问题较另一个记者更有兴趣些。
    使任务的实现不妨碍记者在报纸上提出当地问题的创造的主动性，也是很重要的。编辑部常常打破记者自动地找寻和选择新的有意义的题目的爱好。这种现象多半是在编辑部只发表他所“预订”了的题目的通讯的时候发生的，而且当地方特派记者或积极分子的通讯越出了编辑部的计划时就受不到重视，也不能发表。
    报纸的责任就是用各种方法启发并鼓舞地方特派记者和编辑部以外的积极分子不仅按照任务写稿，而且也发挥创造的主动性，写他们自己所找到的和所研究的题材。
