　　Patriotic Youths of Korea
    Soviet Union, Kornilov
    On June 24th, a Saturday, people were walking on the streets of Pyongyang in holiday attire. Young people wearing student caps walked out of the school gates and went to the cinema, boating on the Datong River, or strolling on the picturesque slopes of the Datuo Ridge with girls in bright national costumes.

    Two or three days after the Li Seung-man bandit gang rebelliously attacked the cities and villages of North Korea, we saw these young people again. After these few days, these young people seemed to have grown up and become adults. Small flags appeared at the entrances of specialized colleges, middle schools, and vocational schools, with multi-faceted Korean characters written on them:

    We are going to the front! We will return victorious!

    Many letters from patriotic youths requesting to go to the front were continuously sent to the editorial offices of newspapers and to the Central Committee of the Kim Il-sung Democratic Youth League.

    On the eighth day of the war, the number of people expressing their willingness to join the army was nearly 100,000. Now, in the north alone, the number of volunteers is approaching 800,000.

    Kim Da-song (transliteration), a foundry worker at the Nampo Metallurgical Factory, was among the first batch of volunteers among the 800,000 workers—his friends and comrades. Young patriots collectively wrote a letter to Kim Il-sung, in which they swore to defend their motherland, even at the cost of their last drop of blood. The youths of the north and the youths of the newly liberated areas of the south stood up and went to battle shoulder to shoulder.

    Kim Deok-gu (transliteration) is a young man who was liberated from the terrible Seoul prison by the People's Army. He had been sentenced to life imprisonment because in his home island of Jeju, residents were the first to take up arms to resist the tyranny of the Li Seung-man regime. On June 28th, Kim Deok-gu was liberated. By June 30th, he and a group of comrades from the prison volunteered to join the People's Army.

    University student Song Eun-mo (transliteration) had been expelled from school several times because he could not and would not remain silent in the face of violence and tyranny. He wrote poems about how twenty of his classmates were suffering. On June 28th, he read his own verses, the sound of which was a warm call to battle.

    A young peasant woman, Qian Ensong (transliteration), went to the front to work as a medic.

    "I want to avenge my husband," she said. "He did not live to see the liberation. Fifteen days before our village was liberated, he was shot near Seoul for allegedly contacting the guerrillas."

    Tenant farmer Li Zhonggen (transliteration) spent several days sneaking across the front line from his village, which was awaiting liberation, to join the ranks of the People's Army.

    The names of patriotic youths who joined the ranks of the soldiers for the cause of justice can be counted in the thousands. In every city and village in Korea, their confident voices can be heard, and those friendly columns heading to the front along winding mountain roads can be seen.

    From July 1st to 7th, more than 13,000 people—mainly young workers from Seoul enterprises—joined the ranks of the People's Volunteer Army. In addition, during this period, more than 17,000 students from various schools in Seoul expressed their desire to go to the front. Recently, the huge wave of volunteer enlistment has been gradually expanding. The youths in the liberated areas of South Korea are preparing to dedicate all their strength to completely defeat the enemy.

    Once you see the brave and resolute faces of these youths going to the front, you will firmly believe that neither airborne fortresses nor warships can defeat them. Young Korea will surely win, because its children are defending it as one. (Sent from Pyongyang on July 22nd)

　　朝鲜的爱国青年们
    苏联  科尔尼洛夫
    六月二十四日，还是星期六，人们穿着假日服装在平壤大街上走。戴学生帽的青年们，走出校门，和穿鲜艳的民族装的少女们一块儿到电影院去，到大同江划船去，或者到大驼岭绿荫如画的山坡上散步去。
    李承晚匪帮叛逆地对北朝鲜的城市和村庄进攻了两三天以后，我们又看见了这些青年。经过这么几天，这些青年似乎长大些，成为成年人了。在专科学院、中学和专门学校的门口出现了一些小旗子，上面写着多棱的朝鲜文：
    我们上前线去！我们要胜利回来！
    许多爱国青年要求出发上前线去的信件，连续寄到报社的编辑部里，寄到金日成民主青年团的中央委员会里。
    在战争的第八天，表示着志愿参军的人数将近十万人。现在呢，单就北部来说，志愿参军的人数快到八十万人了。
    南浦的冶金工厂铸工金多松（译音）就在八十万工人——他的朋友和伙伴们——中间第一批志愿军的队伍里。年青的爱国青年们集体给金日成写了信，在信里他们宣誓保卫自己的祖国，不惜最后一滴血。北部的青年们和南部刚解放地区的青年们，挺起身来肩并肩地走向战斗了。
    金德九（译音）是一个从可怕的汉城监狱中被人民军解放出来的青年。他曾被判处了终身监禁。原因是在他所住的济州岛上，居民首先拿起武器来反抗李承晚政权的专横。六月二十八日，金德九被解放了。到六月三十日，他就和监狱里一批同志们一同志愿地参加人民军。
    大学生宋恩谟（译音）曾被学校开除过好几次，因为看到暴力和专横，他不能、同时也不愿沉默了。他写了关于他的同学二十人怎样受磨难的一些诗。六月二十八日他读到了自己的诗句，这些诗句的音响，是对战斗的热烈号召。
    年青的农妇，钱恩松（译音）到前线去做救护员了。
    “我要给丈夫报仇，”——她说，“他等候不到解放，在我们的村庄解放前十五天，他就在汉城附近，为了和游击队联系的嫌疑，被枪杀了。”
    雇农李忠根（译音）费了好几天时间，从待解放的他自己的村庄偷偷地走过前线，来参加人民军队伍。
    爱国青年的名字举得出成千成万个，他们为了正义事业来参加战士的行列。在朝鲜的每个城市和乡村，都听得到他们充满自信的声音，都看得到那些绕着弯曲的山路上前线去的友爱的纵队。
    从七月一日到七日，有一万三千多人——主要是汉城企业中的青年工人——参加了人民志愿军的行列。此外，在这期间，有汉城各学校学生一万七千多人表示了上前线去的愿望。近来，志愿参军的报名的巨流还是逐渐扩大着。南朝鲜解放区的青年，都准备着供献出自己的全部力量，要彻底战胜敌人。
    这些上前线去的青年们的勇敢坚决的面孔，你一看到，你就会坚定地相信：无论是空中堡垒、无论是战舰，都无法挫败他们。年青的朝鲜一定胜利，因为它的儿女们象一个人似的保卫着它。（七月二十二日平壤发）
              （君强译自七月二十五日真理报）
