Xinhua News Agency, August 20th: According to the Beijing Workers' Daily, the Shanghai Meiya Silk Factory, one of the largest private silk factories in the country, has, through labor-management consultation, preliminarily reformed its unreasonable organizational structure and lowered costs. The factory merged the head office and the Shanghai branch, and laid off sixty employees who either had no work, whose work was unnecessary, whose work ability was low but whose salaries were high, or who were irresponsible in their work. This included four assistant managers and department heads, thirty-one other senior staff members, and twenty-five service workers. This will save the factory more than 10,000 Shanghai accounting units per month (approximately 50 million RMB).

Before this reform, the factory's organization was bloated, and many senior staff members did not work but continued to receive salaries. Production was also abnormal, resulting in monthly losses of as much as 145 million RMB. Although employee salaries were discounted, they still could not be paid on time. Faced with this situation, the factory's trade union suggested to the management that a labor-management consultation meeting be organized to discuss ways to overcome the difficulties. After repeated persuasion by the trade union, the management agreed, and the factory formally established the labor-management consultation meeting on May 1st. Subsequently, labor and management reached an agreement on reforming the organization. After nine meetings of repeated consultation, labor and management signed a "Reorganization Agreement" and implemented the aforementioned streamlining plan. At the same time, the factory's labor-management relations have also improved. Currently, the factory's trade union is further discussing issues such as planned production and the establishment of a labor contract with the management through the labor-management consultation meeting.

　　上海私营美亚绸厂劳资协商改革机构
    开支节省成本减低
    【新华社二十日讯】据北京工人日报载：全国私营绸厂中规模最大者之一，上海美亚绸厂已经过劳资协商，初步改革了不合理的机构，减低了成本。该厂把总公司和上海分公司合并，并把没有工作或工作不需要的、工作能力低而工薪很高的、工作不负责的人员六十人予以裁减。其中包括协理、处长等四人，其他高级职员三十一人，勤杂工人等二十五人。这样该厂每月可节省开支一万多个上海折实单位（约合人民币五千万元左右）。
    该厂在此次改革前，机构臃肿，不少高级职员不做事而照领薪，而生产又不正常，因此每月亏损达一亿四五千万元之多，职工薪金虽然打了折扣，仍不能按时发出。面对这种情况，该厂工会乃向资方建议组织劳资协商会议，协商克服困难的办法。经工会多次说服，资方同意后，该厂在五月一日正式成立了劳资协商会议。随后劳资双方取得了改革机构的协议，又经过九次会议反复协商后，劳资双方才签订了“整编协议”，实施了上述精简方案。与此同时，该厂的劳资关系亦有改善。目前该厂工会正通过劳资协商会议与资方进一步商讨计划生产、订立劳动公约等问题。
