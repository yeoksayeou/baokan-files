　　The Living Conditions of North Korean Peasants in the Five Years Since Liberation
　　Chairman of the North Korean Peasants General League  Jiang Zhenqian
　　Thanks to the decisive power of the Soviet army, our motherland's people have been liberated from the shackles of Japanese imperialist bandits for five years now. We know that from the very first day of the invasion of Korea until the defeat of the Japanese Empire, the long-term rule of the Japanese Empire in Korea strengthened feudal land ownership relations and the system of exploitation.
　　Before liberation, in 1943, 58.2 percent of the total cultivated land in North Korea was controlled by landlords, who accounted for less than 4 percent of the total number of farm households. They deprived the peasants of 50 to 90 percent of their harvest as rent. In addition, Japanese imperialism exploited the peasants' lifeblood through exorbitant taxes, compulsory grain requisitions, and various other methods and means. As a result, the rural economy was completely bankrupted, and the peasants were driven into the abyss of poverty, hunger, darkness, and ruin. During the Japanese imperialist rule, in North Korea alone, there were more than 442,000 tenant farmers and more than 260,000 poor peasants, groaning under cruel exploitation.
　　After liberation, due to the urgent demands of the Korean peasants, the people's regime was quickly established, and the land problem was fundamentally solved.
　　Thanks to the great Soviet army, our motherland was liberated from the shackles of the Japanese Empire. The broad masses of peasants rose up and made strong demands for land. Peasants organized peasant associations and peasant committees in various parts of the country to fight against the landlords.
　　On January 31, 1946, the North Korean Farmers' League (the predecessor of the current Farmers' Alliance), a mass organization of working peasants, was formed. The Farmers' League demanded a rapid solution to the land problem and provided it in the first article of its program.
　　On February 28, 1946, the historically significant Second Congress of the North Korean Farmers' League was held. The broad masses of peasants expressed their ardent demands for land reform and recognized that the possibility of implementing land reform was fully ripe. Therefore, in the name of the congress, a petition for land reform was submitted to the North Korean Provisional People's Committee.
　　The true people's regime—the North Korean Provisional People's Committee—accepted the peasants' demands and promulgated the great Land Reform Ordinance on March 5, 1946. The People's Government unconditionally confiscated a total of more than 1.05 million cho of land owned by the Japanese state, Japanese landlords, pro-Japanese factions, and landlords with more than five cho of land, as well as their rented land. It unconditionally distributed more than 980,000 cho of the confiscated land to more than 720,000 tenant farmers and poor peasants.
　　"The land reform implemented in North Korea broke the long-standing historical social stagnation in Korea, eliminated the feudal relations of exploitation that hindered the development of Korean society, and opened up a path for the free development of Korean society and economy and culture; tenant farmers and poor peasants obtained land, realizing the long-cherished aspirations of Korean peasants for generations, and smashed all feudal and Japanese imperialist remnants and the economic and social foundations of all reactionaries in the countryside that hindered the construction of Korean democracy. Therefore, the basis of the entire reactionary cultural thought was swept away." (Kim Il-sung)
　　Moreover, the land reform implemented in North Korea quickly improved the material living standards of the peasant masses and enhanced their political awareness and enthusiasm; at the same time, it strengthened the brotherly unity between workers and peasants; the peasants themselves knew that they were reliable allies of the working class, the main force in national construction, so they worked more enthusiastically for the great cause of national construction.
　　After the land reform, the rural economy in North Korea developed rapidly. In order to develop the rural economy after the land reform, the People's Government expanded irrigation, increased the production of chemical fertilizers, and improved agricultural tools; at the same time, it universally implemented advanced agricultural technologies and various agricultural facilities, and actively guided and helped the peasants.
　　For the benefit of the people in the vast area of 25,000 cho and the increase in rice production of 53,000 tons, the People's Government spent a huge amount of 1.8 billion yuan from the state treasury to expand the huge irrigation project—the South Pyongan Irrigation Project—on a large scale. At the same time, it expanded state-owned or private irrigation facilities in various places. This expansion is still continuing.
　　The peasants enthusiastically participated in the labor mobilization for irrigation facilities, so by the end of 1948, 58 state-owned irrigation facilities and small-scale irrigation projects carried out according to the peasants' suggestions in various places were completed, creating 39,908 cho of water-safe paddy fields.
　　Now, in North Korea, the People's Government has established three state-owned collective farms, thirteen agricultural experiment stations, six state-owned pastures, and seventy-three breeding farms, universally teaching peasants to use advanced management methods. The North Korean Farmers' League actively implemented the state's policies, and in order to promote the popularization of scientific management techniques and advanced agricultural experience among the peasant masses, it widely organized and implemented agricultural technology popularization projects, and achieved many results.
　　From 1948 to 1950, a total of 31,263 agricultural technology training sessions were held, with a total of 1,895,937 participants. There were also 102,849 agricultural management seminars, with a total of 3,568,264 participants.
　　The number of pamphlets on agricultural technology issued by the Farmers' League reached a total of 178,000 copies by the first issue of 1950 (one issue every three months), and many other technical books were also widely circulated in the countryside.
　　In particular, the Republic's government, starting this year, has set up agricultural machinery stations in five regions of North Korea, using advanced agricultural machinery such as tractors for the first time in Korean agriculture. This spring, 70 tractors cultivated more than 6,300 cho of cultivated land.
　　Moreover, the People's Government has manufactured a large number of advanced agricultural machinery such as weeders, so that they can be widely used in the countryside.
　　The North Korean peasants, who are forever the masters of the land, highly uphold the correct agricultural policies of the People's Government and put forward the slogan of "Don't leave an inch of land uncultivated, increase one more grain of rice." They do their best to increase agricultural production and display a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm and creativity.
　　After the land reform, the per-unit harvest of agricultural products in North Korea has increased year by year. For example, farmer Li Huashi in Gangwon Province increased the yield to 13.15 tons of rice per cho.
　　As a result, the total harvest of agricultural products in the northern half has increased rapidly in the five years since liberation. The total harvest of grain in 1948 increased by 40.6 percent compared to 1946, an increase of more than 5.3 million suk.
　　This has in fact exceeded the highest production level of 1939 before liberation by 110.4 percent.
　　Therefore, in 1948, North Korea, which had a food shortage during the Japanese imperialist rule, became a region where food was not only self-sufficient but also abundant.
　　In terms of the production of other crops, the production of cotton in 1948 increased more than threefold compared to 1947, hemp increased by 129.5 percent, flax increased by 105.5 percent, and tobacco increased by 116.9 percent.
　　In the first year of the Republic's new two-year economic plan, 1949, North Korean peasants worked even harder to produce in the face of an unprecedented drought. As a result, the total harvest of rice and miscellaneous grains increased by 626,490 tons compared to 1944; cotton also increased by 45,033 tons. In terms of animal husbandry, 1949 increased by 100.8 percent compared to 1948, of which pigs increased by 56 percent and sheep increased by 34 percent.
　　Now, North Korean peasants have been fully guaranteed political freedom and rights. They have become the masters of the people's regime led by the working class and directly participate in handling state affairs.
　　Among the deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, our peasants account for 34 percent of the total number of deputies, 59 percent of the total number of deputies to the provincial, city, county, and district people's committees, 39.9 percent of the total number of deputies to the township (district) people's committees, and 91.72 percent of the number of deputies to the village (village) people's committees. It is not difficult to understand the political freedom and activities of North Korean peasants today from these figures.
　　After the peasants have paid their public grain to the state, they still maintain a lot of economic surplus. Therefore, they enthusiastically launched the Patriotic Rice Donation Movement as a fund to consolidate the people's regime. Farmer Kim Je-won in Jaeneung County, Hwanghae Province, was the first to contribute 30 bags of patriotic rice after the land reform. In various places, many patriotic farmers also contribute patriotic rice to the state every year.
　　This illustrates the improvement of the political awareness of North Korean peasants; because all North Korean peasants clearly know that the People's Government, which distributed land to them, is not only for themselves, but also for the freedom, happiness and benefit of all the people.
　　After liberation, the material and cultural standards of peasants have improved significantly. From August 30, 1949 to the present, 126,305 farm households in the rural areas of North Korea have built new houses, and 57,285 farm households have renovated their houses.
　　Since liberation, from the end of 1946 to the present, there have been 3,725 people's schools, 830 junior high schools, 144 senior high schools, and 34 specialized schools in the rural areas of North Korea, with a total of 1,600,905 students. (According to the statistics of the State Planning Commission on June 13, 1950)
　　Now in the countryside of North Korea, newspapers, books and literary works are read by the broad masses of peasants. Taking the Farmers' League's newspaper "Farmers' News" as an example, from the end of April 1950 to the present, the number of issues has reached 22,533,503 copies.
　　In just five years after liberation, the countryside of North Korea has been completely renewed.
　　Welcoming the fifth anniversary of liberation, the Korean peasants are closely united under the banner of their only mass organization, the Farmers' League. They are united with the entire people and gathered like iron and stone around the Republic's government and its leader, General Kim Il-sung, heading towards the road of national prosperity and strength, towards the road indicated by history. They are bravely advancing for the rapid realization of the unification and independence of the motherland.

　　解放五年来北朝鲜农民的生活情况
    北朝鲜农民总同盟委员长  姜镇乾
    由于苏联军队决定性的力量，我们祖国人民，从日本帝国主义强盗的羁绊下解放出来，现在已经五年了。我们知道，从朝鲜被侵略的最初一天起一直到日帝败亡为止，日帝在朝鲜长时期的统治，强化了封建的土地所有关系和剥削制度。
    解放以前，一九四三年，北朝鲜耕地总面积有百分之五八·二掌握在地主手里，他们还不到农家总户数百分之四弱。他们剥夺了农民收获物百分之五○至九○作为租税。此外，日本帝国主义又以苛捐杂税和强制征粮以及其他各种方法与手段，来剥削我们农民的脂膏。结果是造成了农村经济彻底的破产，把农民们驱入了贫穷与饥饿、黑暗与破产的水深火热的深坑里。在日帝统治时代，仅在北朝鲜，就有佃雇农四十四万二千余名，贫农二十六万余名，在苛酷的榨取下呻吟。
    解放后，由于朝鲜农民迫切的要求，很快地树立了人民政权，并根本地解决了土地问题。
    由于伟大的苏联军队，我们祖国从日帝的羁绊下解放了。广大的农民大众，起来提出对于土地的强烈的要求。农民们在全国各地组织了农民协会与农民委员会，和地主们斗争。
    一九四六年一月三十一日，劳动农民的群众团体北朝鲜农民联盟（现农民同盟的前身）组成了。农民同盟要求急速解决土地问题，并在自己纲领的第一条就提供出来。
    一九四六年二月二十八日，有历史性意义的北朝鲜农民同盟第二次大会召开了，广泛的农民大众，表现了对于土地改革的热烈要求，并且认定了土地改革实施的可能性已完全成熟。因之，以大会的名义，向北朝鲜临时人民委员会，提出对于土地改革的请愿书。
    真正的人民政权——北朝鲜临时人民委员会，接受了农民们这样的要求，在一九四六年三月五日，就发表了伟大的土地改革法令。人民政府把日本国家、日本地主、以及亲日派、民族叛逆者五町步以上土地的地主的所有地和他们出租地共计一○五万余町步，无条件的加以没收，并把没收土地中的九十八万余町步无条件分配给七十二万余户的佃农和贫农。
    “北朝鲜实行的土地改革，打破了朝鲜那种纠缠已久的在历史上的社会停滞状态，肃清了妨碍朝鲜社会发展的封建剥削关系，又开辟了朝鲜社会和经济文化一条自由发展的大路；雇农贫农得到了土地。实现了朝鲜农民世世代代的热望，打垮了在农村妨碍朝鲜民主主义建设的全部封建的和日本帝国主义的残余势力以及一切反动派的经济与社会的基础。因此，整个反动的文化思想的根据是被一扫而空了。”（金日成）
    并且，在北朝鲜实行的土地改革，很快的改善了农民大众的物质生活水准，提高了他们政治的觉悟与热情；同时，又使得工人与农民之间兄弟般的团结更加坚固；农民们自己知道：他们是建国的主力部队工人阶级的可靠同盟者，因此为了祖国的建国大业，更热情地工作着。
    土地改革后，北朝鲜农村经济很快地发展起来了。人民政权为了土地改革后农村经济的发展，扩展灌溉，增加化学肥料生产，和改善农具；同时，普遍的实行了进步的农业技术和各种农业设施，并对农民们积极的加以指导与帮助。
    为了二万五千町步庞大地区的人民福利和五三、○○○吨的米谷增产，人民政权支出了十八亿元巨额的国库金，大规模地扩张了巨大的灌溉工程——平南灌溉工程。同时又扩大了各地国营或民营的灌溉设施。这种扩展还在继续进行着。
    农民们热情地参加了灌溉设施的劳力动员，所以在一九四八年年底，就完成了五十八个国营灌溉设施和根据农民们建议而进行的各地小规模的灌溉工程，造成了三九、九○八町步的水利安全的水田。
    现在，在北朝鲜，人民政府设立了三个国营集体农场，十三个农事试验场，六个国营牧场，七十三个种畜场，普遍地教导农民们使用进步的经营方法。北朝鲜农民同盟，积极执行了国家的政策，在农民大众中，为了促使科学经营技术与先进农业经验的普及，广泛地组织与实施了农业技术的普及事业，收到了很多的成果。
    自从一九四八年起，到一九五○年为止，已召开的农业技术讲习会共有三一、二六三次，参加的总人数为一、八九五、九三七人。还有一○二、八四九次的农业经营座谈会，参加的总人数为三、五六八、二六四人。
    农民同盟发行的关于农业技术的小册子，到一九五○年的第一期（每三个月为一期）为止，总计已达到一七八、○○○部，其他许多技术书籍，也在农村广泛地流行着。
    特别是共和国政府，从今年起，在北朝鲜的五个地区里，设置了农业机械站，在朝鲜农业上，第一次地使用了拖拉机等的进步农业机械。今年春季，以七○架拖拉机耕植了六、三○○余町步的耕地。
    并且，人民政权又把除草机等进步农业机械，大量地制造，使其能在农村里广泛使用着。
    永为土地的主人的北朝鲜农民们，高度地奉行着人民政权的正确农业政策，并提出了“一寸地也不荒，多增一粒米”的口号。对于农产物的增产，他们尽自己的全力，发挥了高度的爱国热情与创造性。
    土地改革后，北朝鲜农产物的每单位的收获量一年一年地增加，举例来说，江原道农民李华石每町步增产到一三公吨一五○公斤的稻子。
    这样的结果是，解放后的五年间，北半部的农产物总收获额已经很快地提高了。对于谷物的收获额，一九四八年度就比一九四六年度增加了百分之四○·六，即增产了五三○万石以上。
    这在事实上已经超过了解放前一九三九年度的最高生产水准的百分之一一○·四了。
    因此，在一九四八年度，已经使日帝统治时代食粮不足的北朝鲜，变成了一个食粮不仅可以自给自足而且显得富裕的地区了。
    在其他农作物的生产方面，一九四八年度比一九四七年度，棉花的生产增加了三倍以上，大麻增加了百分之一二九·五，亚麻增加了百分之一○五·五，烟草增加了百分之一一六·九。
    在共和国的新二年经济计划的第一年，即一九四九年度，北朝鲜农民们在空前的旱灾中，更努力生产，因而米谷杂粮的总收获量，比一九四四年度增产了六二六、四九○吨；棉花也增产了四五、○三三吨。畜产方面，一九四九年度比一九四八年度，增殖了百分之一○○·八，其中猪增殖了百分之五六，绵羊增殖了百分之三四。
    现在，北朝鲜农民们在政治的自由和权利上得到了完全的保障。他们已经作了以工人阶级为首的人民政权的主人，直接地参加了处理国家的事务。
    在朝鲜最高人民会议议员中，我们农民占总议员人数百分之三四，占道、市、郡、区域人民委员会议员总数百分之五九，占面（区）人民委员会议员总数百分之三九·九，占里（村）人民委员会议员人数百分之九一·七二。就从这些数字，不难了解，今日北朝鲜农民们的政治的自由与活动。
    农民把国家的公粮纳完以后，还保持着很多的经济剩余力。所以他们很踊跃地展开了献爱国米运动，作为巩固人民政权的基金。黄海道载宁郡农民金济元，土地改革后，首先贡献出三○袋爱国米，在各地，很多的爱国农民们也年年地向国家贡献着爱国米。
    这是说明了北朝鲜农民们的政治觉悟的提高；因为北朝鲜全体农民们，很明确地知道，分给他们土地的人民政府，不仅为了他们自己，而且是为了全体人民的自由、幸福与利益的缘故。
    解放后，农民的物质文化水准异常提高。一九四九年八月三十日起到现在止，在北朝鲜的农村中，一二六、三○五户的农家建造了新房，五七、二八五户的农家改修了房屋。
    解放后，从一九四六年末到现在，在北朝鲜农村，已有人民学校三、七二五校，初级中学八三○校，高级中学一四四校，专门学校三四校，学生总计达一、六○○、九○五名。（据一九五○年六月十三日国家计划委员会的统计）
    现在北朝鲜的农村里，报纸、书籍以及文艺作品等，被广大的农民阅读着。仅以农民同盟的机关报“农民新闻”来说，从一九五○年四月末到现在，发行数已达二二、五三三、五○三份。
    解放后，不过五年的时间，北朝鲜的农村即焕然一新了。
    迎接着解放五周年的朝鲜农民们，在自己唯一的群众组织农民同盟的旗帜下，紧密地团结着。他们联合了全体人民，铁石般地集结在共和国政府与其首长金日成将军的周围，走向着祖国富强的路，走向历史所指引的路。他们为了祖国统一独立的急速实现勇敢地在前进。
