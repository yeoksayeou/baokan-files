Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th TASS: Ilya Ehrenburg reported on his impressions of his recent visit to London in "Pravda," writing: The British people displayed their spiritual qualities during those difficult years. The cleared rubble of broken walls and the rows of barrack-like brown houses, cold in winter and unbearably hot in summer, remind one of how this city lived through it all. The ordinary men and women of London showed composure and courage during the years of air raids. Perhaps they showed even greater perseverance, patiently enduring the hardships and poverty; quite unlike neighboring France, people depend on rationing for their lives. Even today, many things are still rationed, such as meat, fat, eggs, sugar, tea, soap, and so on. This, of course, cannot be credited to the government, which believes that dropping bombs on Malayans and Koreans is much better than putting white sugar on the tables of ordinary British people. However, we must commend ordinary British people, because their calmness helped them live without white sugar.

We cannot say that London is not building anything; construction projects are underway, but it is not enough. I saw a batch of houses: the government first built them for the needs of the country, but it did not have enough money to decorate the rooms, so it sold them to a private company; now the government is renting a part of these houses. The British talk about this with a wry smile. Incidentally, they smile that way on many occasions, and I should frankly say that it is an unpleasant smile.

Why should the British endure poverty? Why should they work like this, knowing that what they produce will be shipped overseas? Why should they be squeezed into barracks? In the years after the war, they have always heard: to avoid economic dependence, to avoid American protection, this is necessary. Honest ordinary British people easily believe the honesty of others. They have believed in the honesty of their rulers for a long time, perhaps too long. They first began to suspect this summer: the events in the Far East helped them understand why they had to live in barracks and eat whale meat. Despite the dyke built by newspaper lies, ordinary British people know who is aggressing against Korea, and they know that the regime established by the Americans in South Korea is no different from Chiang Kai-shek's regime. Ordinary British people are worriedly aware that the Americans' occupation of a large island of China means a new war crisis. Here, even cunning and scheming journalists are at a loss as to what news to fabricate and how to explain to readers why Britain, which has recognized the People's Republic of China, must support the Americans who occupy Taiwan.

On July 30, Attlee delivered a broadcast address to the British people. He told them that life would be even more difficult in the future because they had to arm themselves. Labor Party members have been urging the British people to make sacrifices until recently, saying "we must avoid economic dependence," but now Attlee is asking his compatriots to tighten their belts even further in order to finally get rid of political independence and become regular soldiers fighting for others.

Ehrenburg continued, Britain is going through the most turbulent and important page in its history. Not long ago, the British peace movement seemed very weak. Now, people's eyes seem to be opening. At the National Peace Congress, I met many clergymen and Labor Party members, Quakers and intellectuals, who were far from being Communists. This movement is growing among the masses, and it is no accident that several trade union representatives attended this conference. This movement also includes the elite of intellectuals.

The number of people who have signed the Stockholm Appeal has also increased. To date, nearly one million people in Britain have signed this declaration. Readers who are not familiar with British life will say, not many. My view is different: not few. If we consider that the Labor Party has forbidden its members to sign it, and the highest bishops in the church, the Archbishops of York and Canterbury, have also opposed it, then this number is not small.

The demand to ban atomic weapons is a test of strength. The British have asked me more than once why peace advocates only condemn atomic weapons. I replied that this is only the first step. Now, people in all countries hope to stop the war in Asia, to stop the "cold war" launched by American diplomats, and to establish lasting peace. The people of Britain also hope for these things. Mr. Churchill is still more of a figurehead than a person who sways the hearts of the British people. As for the leadership of the Labor Party, it has no countermeasure to American demands: Mr. Truman is ordering, and Mr. Bevin is trying not to make any mistakes. The slanders in the newspapers, the opinions about waging a "preventive war," and the propaganda of hatred have not penetrated the hearts of the British people; we should not listen to the frenzy of London's financial district, the delirious ramblings of the "Daily Mail," or the "Daily Herald's" false sighs about the thoughts and feelings of the British people.

Ehrenburg wrote in conclusion: Airplanes fly low over that city, groups of houses, the red dots of buses, the black and white dots of people on the sports field, all this seems like tiny toys; seen from the air, a huge city looks like a model, exquisite, neat and painted. However, this city is not calm; although it does not have the enthusiasm of the South, nor the flags and noise of demonstrations in the streets, its restraint should not be mistaken for humiliation and tolerance of surrender. The British people still have something to say, and I don't think what they say will suit Mr. Truman's taste.

　　访问伦敦印象
　　爱伦堡
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：伊利亚·爱伦堡报道他最近访问伦敦所获得的印象，在《真理报》上写道：英国人民在那患难的岁月中曾表现出他们精神上的特质。那末曾清除的断墙残垣，那冬天寒冷夏天热得难受的一排排兵营一样的褐色的房舍，令人想到这个都市是怎样生活过来的。伦敦的普通男女在那空袭的年月中曾表现出沉着与勇敢。他们也许表现过更大的坚毅精神，耐心地忍受那些困苦与贫穷；和邻近的法国显然不同，人民都靠配给生活。直到今天，许多东西还在实行配给，如：肉、脂肪、蛋、糖、茶叶、肥皂等等。这当然不能归功于政府，这个政府认为向马来亚人和朝鲜人投掷炸弹要比把白糖放在普通英国人的桌上好得多。然而，我们不得不称赞普通的英国人，因为他们的镇静帮助他们过了没有白糖的生活。
    我们不能说伦敦什么也没有建筑；建筑工程是在进行着，但这是不够的。我曾看见一批房屋：政府为了国家的需要，首先把它建筑起来，但是它没有足够的钱来装修房间，便把它卖给一家私营公司了；现在政府租用着这所房屋的一部分。英国人带着苦笑说起这件事。附带说一句，他们在很多场合都是那样地微笑，我应该坦白地说，这是一种不愉快的微笑。
    英国人为什么要忍受贫困？他们为什么要这样的工作，明知道他们所生产的东西将被运往海外去？他们为什么要挤在兵营里面？战后的这几年，他们总是听说：为了避免经济的依赖性，避免美国的保护，这是必要的。诚实的普通英国人易于相信别人的诚实。他们相信他们统治者的诚实已经很久，也许是太久了。他们在今年的夏天才首先怀疑起来：远东的事件帮助他们理解到，他们为什么要住在兵营里面而且吃鲸鱼肉。尽管报纸的谎言筑成一道堤防，普通的英国人都知道谁在侵略朝鲜，他们知道美国人在朝鲜南部建立的政权简直无异于蒋介石的政权。普通的英国人忧虑地觉悟到，美国人霸占中国的一个大岛，这就意味着新战争的危机。这里，甚至是狡猾机诈的新闻记者也茫然不知所措，究竟是捏造些什么消息好，究竟怎样来向读者解释，已经承认中华人民共和国的英国为什么必须支持霸占台湾的美国人。
    七月三十日，艾德礼曾向英国人民发表广播演说。他对他们说，今后的生活一定更为艰苦，因为必须进行武装。工党党员直到最近都在敦促英国人牺牲，他们说“我们必须避免经济的依赖性”，而现在，艾德礼却叫他的同胞们把裤带束得更紧，以便最后摆脱政治的独立性，变为为别人打仗的正规士兵。
    爱伦堡继称，英国正在度过它的历史中最动乱而且最重要的一页。不久以前，英国的和平运动似乎很微弱。现在，人们的眼睛仿佛睁开了。在全国和平大会上，我曾遇见许多教士与工党党员，教友派教徒和知识分子，他们都远不是共产党员。这个运动在群众中间增长，若干工会代表出席这个大会也不是偶然的。这个运动也包括着知识分子的精英。
    在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数也增加了。到现在为止，这个宣言在英国已有将近一百万人签名。不熟悉英国生活的读者将要说，不多啊。我的说法却不同：不少啦。如果我们想到工党曾禁止它的党员在上面签名以及教会中最高的主教、约克和坎特伯雷的大主教也来反对它，那末这个数目是不少的。
    关于禁止原子武器的要求，就是力量的试验。英国人不止一次地问我，和平拥护者为什么只限于谴责原子武器。我回答说，这不过是第一个步骤。现在，各国的人民都希望停止亚洲的战争，希望停止美国外交家所发动的“冷战”，希望建立持久的和平。英国的人民也希望这些。邱吉尔先生依然与其说是一个左右英国人心的人，不如说是一个虚有其表的人物。至于工党的领导机关，它对于美国的要求毫无对策：杜鲁门先生在吩咐，贝文先生则力图不要犯任何的错误。报纸上的诽谤，关于进行“预防性战争”的意见，仇恨的宣传都没有深入英国的人心；我们不应该听信伦敦金融区的热狂，《每日邮报》的谵语，或是《每日先驱报》对于英国人民思想与情感的虚伪的叹息。
    爱伦堡在结语中写道：飞机在那个都市上面低飞，一群群的房屋，公共汽车的红色小点，运动场上人们的黑色与白色小点，这一切都仿佛是细小的玩具；从空中看起来，一个巨大的都市活像一副模型，精巧、整齐而且涂着油漆。然而，这个都市并不沉静，它虽然没有南方的热情，没有街道上的示威旗帜和喧哗，它的拘谨却不可误认为屈辱与对投降的忍耐。英国人民还是要说话的，我不觉得他们所说的话就会合杜鲁门先生的脾胃。
