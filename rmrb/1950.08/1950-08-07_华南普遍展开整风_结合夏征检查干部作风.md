　　Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th—A rectification movement has been universally launched in organizations directly under the Central Committee of the CCP South China Sub-bureau, directly under the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CCP, various local committees, county committees, and units under the Guangzhou Municipal Committee of the CCP.

　　The CCP South China Sub-bureau, Guangdong Provincial Committee, and Guangzhou Municipal Committee all began rectification in mid-July. They are currently reading the designated rectification documents and are about to enter the work inspection stage.

　　The rectification study of the CCP's local committees in Guangdong Province began earlier. So far, most of the local committees have held rectification meetings including the county party secretaries of each county and the main party member cadres of the local and special commissioner organs, reviewed the achievements and shortcomings in the work of collecting public grain, production for famine relief, and anti-despotism and rent reduction in the past six months, and proposed methods for improvement. Several county committees have also begun to hold rectification meetings and have absorbed party member cadres above the district level to participate. All units under the Hainan District Committee have also begun to study rectification documents.

　　Because the CCP's organizations at all levels in South China have been in the enemy's rear war environment for a long time, and there has not been enough time to carry out ideological and policy education for party members and cadres. Therefore, after the liberation of South China, cadres have made many mistakes and shortcomings in the execution of various work tasks. Based on the above situation, the South China Sub-bureau decided that the focus of this rectification movement is: in the cities, mainly rectify the bureaucracy and commandism of party member cadres in the government, finance, and public security departments; in the countryside, correct serious commandism and disorganized, undisciplined states through policy education to consolidate the organization and strengthen unity. In terms of methods, adopt a top-down and top-down combination to carry out criticism and self-criticism. In terms of steps, because rural summer grain collection work is busy, the local committees and county and district leading organs decided to complete the preliminary rectification before the summer grain collection, and then carry out a universal and in-depth rectification after the summer grain collection is over; at the same time, in conjunction with the summer grain collection work, check the improvement of the work style of party member cadres.

　　Since most party members have not formally participated in the rectification movement, many party members have ideological concerns in the rectification meetings of some local committees and county committees. For example, when making self-criticism, they are afraid of exposing shortcomings and being punished; when criticizing superiors, they are afraid that superiors will not accept it or be retaliated against, or they think that criticizing superiors will damage the prestige of superiors, and so on. After in-depth mobilization and repeated education by the rectification leading organs, the above-mentioned ideological concerns have gradually been dispelled.

### 华南普遍展开整风  结合夏征检查干部作风

　　华南普遍展开整风
    结合夏征检查干部作风
    【新华社广州四日电】中共中央华南分局直属机关、中共广东省委会直属党委、各地方委员会、县委会及中共广州市委所属各单位，已普遍展开整风运动。
    中共华南分局、广东省委会、广州市委会均于七月中旬开始整风。现正阅读指定的整风文件，即将进入检查工作的阶段。
    中共广东省各地委的整风学习则开始较早。到目前为止，大部分地委会都已举行了包括各县县委书记及地委、专署机关主要党员干部参加的整风会议，检讨了半年来在征收公粮、生产度荒和反霸减租等工作中的成绩和缺点，并提出改进的方法。若干县委会亦已开始举行整风会议，并吸收了区以上党员干部参加。海南区党委所属各单位亦已开始学习整风文件。
    中共华南分局所属各级组织，由于过去长期处于敌后战争环境，没有充裕时间来进行党员干部的思想和政策教育，因而，华南解放后，干部在执行各种工作任务中产生了不少错误和缺点。根据上述情况，华南分局决定这次整风运动的重点是：在城市中，主要整顿政权、财经、公安等部门党员干部的官僚主义和命令主义的不良作风；在农村中，则通过政策教育，纠正严重的命令主义和无组织、无纪律状态，以巩固组织，加强团结。在方法上，采取自上而下和上下结合的方式展开批评和自我批评。在步骤上，因农村夏征工作繁忙，各地委会及县、区领导机关决定在夏征前完成初步整顿，到夏征结束后，再普遍和深入进行；同时，结合夏征工作，检查党员干部工作作风的改进情形。
    由于大多数党员没有正式参加过整风运动，因而在若干地委、县委的整风会议中，不少党员存在着思想顾虑。如自我批评时，怕暴露缺点，怕受处分；在批评上级时，怕上级不接受或受到报复，或认为批评上级有损上级威信等等。上述这些思想顾虑，在经过整风领导机关的深入动员和反复教育后，已逐渐解除。
