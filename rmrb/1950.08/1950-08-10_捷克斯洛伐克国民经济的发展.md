The Development of the National Economy of Czechoslovakia
    Peng Lu

    At the beginning of its establishment, the People's Republic of Czechoslovakia faced serious difficulties in restoring its economy, which had been completely destroyed during World War II. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the new country immediately set the primary goals of overcoming these difficulties. These were to ensure the nation's food supply, increase industrial production that had sharply declined to fifty percent of pre-war levels, transform industry into peaceful production, rebuild all destroyed factories, and restore control over the disrupted transportation system. As for the widespread phenomenon of worthless paper money caused by the previous currency devaluation, it was relatively easy to address. This task was completed by the end of 1945 with currency reform. The currency reform stabilized the new crown exchange rate against the pre-war crown at a ratio of three to one, while simultaneously adjusting prices, wages, and salaries at the same ratio.

    Having learned the lessons of history bought with suffering and blood, the Czech and Slovak nations, after liberation, placed all property confiscated from German invaders, traitors, and collaborators under state control; in the autumn of 1945, they forcefully implemented large-scale nationalization of industries, mines, banks, and private insurance companies. Nationalization transferred (in terms of relative labor force) sixty percent of all industry and the vast majority of financial resources to the masses. Industrial or banking enterprises holding or controlling shares of other businesses were also included in nationalization. The beginning of state control in enterprises and the subsequent nationalization policy were not only the basic pillars of the people's democracy but also tools for restoring the entire economy. With the help of workers and labor brigades, factories destroyed during the war were quickly rebuilt, and the peaceful transformation of production was swiftly completed. The first post-war harvest was completed (with significant help from urban residents), and the supply of essential grains was ensured. In 1945, the biggest economic difficulty—transportation bottlenecks—was gradually overcome, and industrial production rapidly recovered. Compared to the 1937 level, industrial production increased from fifty percent in 1945 to sixty percent by May 1946, and to eighty percent by the end of 1946. It is worth noting that this achievement was reached even though the post-war population was three million less than in 1937.

    Under these conditions, entering a period of economic planning was not only possible but also necessary. Before the 1946 general election, the Czechoslovak Communist Party, led by Gottwald, drafted a two-year plan and used it as the main program of its election manifesto. After the Czech Communist Party's election victory, the draft two-year plan became the action plan of the first Gottwald government. Within a few months, the parliament passed the two-year plan, which was finally announced on October 28, 1946, a matter of concern to millions of people.

    The Two-Year Plan

    What was the essence of the two-year plan?

    The goal of the two-year plan was to restore the Czech economy to pre-war levels. Therefore, it was primarily an economic recovery plan. To achieve this goal, a short-term two-year plan was sufficient. The two-year plan set targets to reach an average production of one hundred and ten percent of the 1937 level in industrial production; one hundred percent of pre-war levels in agricultural production; restoration of 1937 transportation volume; and construction or repair of 120,000 housing units and completion of numerous industrial, transportation, and public buildings with a total value of 25.73 billion crowns. According to the two-year plan, the main labor force numbers in each economic sector were as follows: 270,000 people in industrial production, 90,000 in the construction industry, and 230,000 in agricultural production.

    The two-year plan specified production volumes for one hundred and ten types of products as "special targets." Other types of products were indirectly planned, generally through investment plans and centralized allocation of raw materials and semi-finished products. To achieve this goal, budgets for raw materials, semi-finished products, and electricity were prepared based on coal, iron, steel, electricity, and cement conditions, and labor force budgets were also prepared.

    An important part of the two-year plan was the foreign trade plan, which set out the tasks to be accomplished for basic export and import trade.

    On January 1, 1947, the great enthusiasm of the Czech working people was poured into the two-year plan, and they understood its profound significance for socialist development. The goals of the two-year plan, especially in industry and transportation (referring to the mostly socialized sectors), were successfully completed step by step from the beginning.

    The reactionary forces within Czechoslovakia fully understood the importance of the two-year plan for consolidating the people's democracy and developing the socialist future. Therefore, the reactionaries (although they could not come forward openly) tried their best to sabotage the two-year plan, diminishing the enthusiasm and confidence of the working people in the great construction cause. In particular, they used their positions in various economic sectors and the unfortunate crop failure of 1947 (which caused economic losses of more than 15 billion crowns) to engage in direct sabotage activities. Their ultimate goal was to disorganize the economy, collapse the people's democratic order, and thus revert to the pre-war capitalist situation. In agricultural production, the construction industry, and the rationing system, the sabotage activities of the reactionary forces were prevalent. These were some of the sectors that nationalization had not yet affected.

    The Impact of the Victory of the February Coup

    The victory of the February Coup marked the beginning of a new stage in Czech economic development. This was the stage of implementing the second step of nationalization. The second step of nationalization included all domestic wholesale trade, all foreign trade and international transportation, as well as industrial and other enterprises with more than fifty employees. Some particularly important production sectors (such as pharmaceutical production) were completely nationalized.

    After the second phase of nationalization, the socialist component of the Czech economy was greatly strengthened, including 95 percent of all industry, almost 100 percent of transportation, more than 80 percent of the construction industry, and steadily growing retail and tourism sectors.

    After the February victory, the two-year plan was successfully implemented. The transportation industry exceeded its original target. In industry—except for the food industry, which was affected by the 1947 crop failure—all the goals of the two-year plan were completed at 110.5 percent. Among such enormous achievements, seven sectors exceeded the original targets, and the remaining four sectors were only slightly below the original targets. However, the percentage figures of plan completion are not sufficient to fully and accurately illustrate the growth of the Czech industry. Let's look at the following information:

    The plundering by the German invaders greatly reduced the Czech industrial labor force. However, the number of employees in industry exceeded the pre-war level by 3 percent. Therefore, compared to the 1937 level, industrial productivity reached 104 percent. More importantly, the production volume of major goods exceeded the pre-war level by 30 percent. This achievement laid the foundation for large-scale development and transformation of the national industry in the Five-Year Plan. Compared with the 1937 level, the production volume increased by 18 percent.

    If we take the production volume of 1937 as 100, then the average figures of production volume achieved by each sector in 1948 are as follows:
    Industry Sector    Production Volume          Labor Force        Productivity
    Mining         113.3      140.4      80.7
    Electricity         183.9      135.2      136.0
    Metal         117.8      117.1      100.6
    Chemical         124.0      117.1      105.9
    Glass         86.7      92.4      93.8
    Construction Materials and Ceramics         117.5      78.2      150.3
    Paper         95.6      102.4      93.4
    Wood         77.0      92.5      83.2
    Textiles and Clothing  76.5      78.5      97.5
    Leather and Rubber  112.1      116.2      96.5
    Printing         110.2      103.9      160.1

    The development of the most important industrial sectors is shown in the following table:
    Products    Annual Production Volume    1937  1947  1948
    Hard Coal (tons) 16,770,000 16,215,800 17,750,700
    Lignite (tons) 17,895,000 22,362,100 23,589,400
    Electricity (kW) 4,115,000   6,663,000   7,515,000
    Tractors         207           5,479           9,098
    Motorcycles   14,116         39,558         68,007
    Bicycles   70,720       186,000       231,452
    Generators (5-25 kW)82,000     222,130      276,204
    Phosphate Fertilizers (tons)    312,000       343,600      307,500
    Sulfuric Acid (tons)        165,600       192,900      215,000
    Rayon (tons)          4,002          4,382           5,160
    Flat Glass (tons)       126,259      130,962
    Paper (tons)           227,100      260,000
    Cotton Yarn (tons)           59,160        68,182
    Wool Fabrics (tons)         19,566        23,808

    The increase in transportation speed can be illustrated by the following figures for freight car unloading (monthly average):

    1937      1946      1947      1948
    5.6 days        7 days  5.8 days        5.4 days

    The great achievements of the two-year plan have completed the industrialization of Slovakia. Unemployment was eliminated. Compared with 1937, the industrial production of Slovakia in 1946 was 121 percent, and at the completion of the two-year plan, it increased to 225 percent, while the national production only increased to 110 percent. In terms of production volume, Slovakia should have been allocated 12.8 percent of the total industry in 1946, and after two years, it was 13.9 percent. Compared with 1947, the national income in Slovakia increased by 15.3 percent in 1948, and Slovakia increased from 18.7 percent to 20 percent in the total national income. The national income per capita increased from 9,556 crowns per person in 1946 to 12,609 crowns per person in 1948. Such a successful step has brought the social level of Slovakia closer to the average of the more advanced Czech provinces.

    The two-year plan has thus become a great victory for the Czech planned economy. It has completed its main production goals, averaging over 10 percent above pre-war production levels. Although affected by the crop failure of 1947, the two-year plan still improved the living standards of the people.

    The Five-Year Plan

    The achievements mentioned above made it possible for the Czech Republic to successfully start the Five-Year Plan. As in the two-year plan period, the economic development and transformation plan began under the leadership of the Chairman of the Czech Communist Party, Gottwald. After the people's victory in the February coup and the victory in the 1948 general election, the Five-Year Plan became the main program in the plan of the new National Front government. After Gottwald was elected president and Zápotocký became prime minister, the Five-Year Plan, which millions of working people had been longing for, was announced on October 28, 1948 (the 30th anniversary of the founding of the Czechoslovak Republic). This Five-Year Plan, which began on January 1, 1949, is the driving force for Czechoslovakia to move towards socialism.

    How are the two-year plan and the five-year plan different? The two-year plan first sought economic reconstruction and restoration, while the five-year plan aimed to realize economic transformation and future development, and its ultimate goal was to further improve the living standards of the working people in cities and villages with the increase in production, and on this basis, the unity of workers, farmers, intellectuals and the middle class in cities was further consolidated.

    In the development of Czechoslovak people's democracy towards socialism, the Five-Year Plan represents an important stage. Especially in terms of strengthening and consolidating nationalized industries and moving towards national mechanization and electrification, the Five-Year Plan laid the initial foundation for more advanced production methods in various economic sectors. At the same time, through the Five-Year Plan, the remaining capitalist elements in all state-owned economic sectors will be gradually restricted and eliminated.

    The Five-Year Plan has become a powerful weapon for the working class and working people to lay the foundation for socialism. It will help to develop the socialist component of the Czech economy, restrict and eliminate capitalist components, increase labor productivity to an unprecedented level, and create conditions for the development of new labor methods. The broad masses of working people have put forward a specific slogan: "The Five-Year Plan—our road to socialism."

    The Czechoslovak economy must be developed according to completely new standards and new domestic and foreign situations. Gottwald's words can be used as a reference. He said:

    "The roots of the Czech economic structure are mostly from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and are designed to adapt to that era. They must be transformed and adjusted to adapt to today's political and economic situation. This means changing those industrial sectors that could compete in the international market before the war and relied on meager wages (such as the manufacturing plants of gloves, toys, etc., especially the textile and glass industries), leading them to industries that are beneficial to our situation, so that these sectors may occupy the international market with their production, such as the metal industry, with particular emphasis on heavy industry and the chemical industry..."

    The Five-Year Plan will make such changes in the economic structure possible. The focus of transformation and increased production is the metal industry, and its production volume will increase by 93% over the 1948 level after five years. The 1948 level has greatly exceeded the pre-war level; the production volume of heavy industry will increase four times. Such a large increase requires a considerable increase in the production volume of other sectors of heavy industry, such as mining, casting, electricity, and chemicals. This does not mean that the consumer goods industry will be restricted or stagnated; its growth rate is not very fast according to the surplus needs of the entire economy.

    In the Five-Year Plan, the growth of production volume in various industrial sectors is illustrated in the table below in terms of the 1948 level:

    Industry      Increase in Production Volume (%)  Industry      Increase in Production Volume (%)
    Mining      35  Chemical      62
    Electricity      52  Glass      12
    Casting      49  Building Materials and Ceramics      12
    Metal      93  Paper        41
    Woodworking      26  Brewery    68
    Textiles and Clothing        68  Flour Mill    30
    Leather and Rubber          43  Food      79
    Printing      18  Handicraft Production  20
    Film      56  Total Industry  57
    Sugar Refinery    17  Main Goods          66
            Consumer Goods  50

    In the process of transforming the Czech industrial structure, the orientation of trade with the Soviet Union and people's democracies is further adjusted. Not only is the domestic economic crisis eliminated—but the possibility of economic crises "spilling over" from foreign trade is also eliminated.

    In the Five-Year Plan, the economic structure in agricultural production will also be changed, and the focus will be increasingly placed on the production of more favorable and valuable livestock. The total agricultural production volume will exceed the 1948 level by 38 percent, with crop production increasing by only 11 percent, while livestock production will increase by 86 percent.

    Obviously, these economic structural changes require a large amount of investment. The Five-Year Plan stipulates a total investment value of 336.2 billion crowns, which is allocated as follows:

    Industry          139.9 billion crowns
    Agriculture          26.8 billion crowns
    Construction Industry        4.6 billion crowns
    Transportation Industry        52.9 billion crowns
    Trade and Tourism          5.0 billion crowns
    Housing Construction      39.3 billion crowns
    Social Welfare      8.1 billion crowns
    Health Care and State-Owned Insurance          10.3 billion crowns
    Culture          10.2 billion crowns
    Investment in roads and bridges, industrial hydrogen production equipment, public building designs, and other public operations
        47.1 billion crowns

    In addition, 5 billion crowns are allocated for local government plans, mainly for the improvement of small towns and villages; the completion of these plans will not change the labor force in other sectors, because it is mainly done through voluntary and contributing people.

    The completion of all these plans will increase the national income from 210 billion crowns in 1948 to 310 billion crowns in 1953, an increase of 48 percent.

    The target for the increase in labor productivity in five years is approximately as follows: Industrial labor productivity is to be increased by 32 percent, agriculture and forestry by 20 percent, construction by 53 percent, and transportation by 30 percent. The Five-Year Plan also made more detailed budget tables for raw materials, main semi-finished products, and electricity than in the Two-Year Plan; the entire Five-Year Plan, in the labor force budget table, stipulated an 18 percent increase in the number of workers employed in industry, a 4 percent decrease in agriculture and forestry, a 50 percent increase in construction, and a 6 percent increase in transportation.

    Foreign trade is far more suited to reality than in the Two-Year Plan period, mainly because import and export trade is completely taken over from capitalists and operated solely by state-owned companies; also, the ratio of the allocation of foreign trade volume to planned economic countries is increasing. Long-term trade agreements concluded with these countries enable Czechoslovakia to correctly plan mutual import and export trade.

    In the Five-Year Plan, the planning of social consumption (national insurance, social welfare, health care, and culture) and personal consumption in the domestic rationing system has also begun to appear.

    Because the Czechoslovak Five-Year Plan is a plan of great victory, including and guiding the development of the entire society, it is possible to mobilize the intelligent working people to realize the great task of building socialism.

    The united working people are the main factor in the economic development of Czechoslovakia. Under the leadership of the Czech Communist Party, the working class has been playing a leading role since liberation, completing the task of national construction better and faster.

    From 1945 to 1948, millions of Czechoslovak people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, participated in voluntary labor shock brigades. Obligatory labor competitions such as "Million Work Hours" and "Thirty Million Work Hours" were carried out one after another. In industry, cities and rural areas, the total obligatory labor competition exceeded 760 million work hours.

    In addition, movements such as increasing production and reducing costs have also been widely launched in many factories, and workers are voluntarily increasing their labor productivity.

    Soviet Aid to Czechoslovakia

    After the liberation of Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union immediately supplied it with major raw materials; without these raw materials, it would have been completely impossible for Czechoslovakia to start production. At the time of liberation, transportation was completely disintegrated, and the few repaired railways were very crowded with military transport. Despite this, as early as August 1945, the Soviet Union delivered 14,000 tons of iron sand to Czechoslovakia. At the end of 1945, it delivered 76,000 tons of iron sand and 9,000 tons of manganese. Without these raw materials, it would have been impossible for Czech industry to produce.

    Not only in the industrial sector did the Soviet Union make the machines of Czechoslovakia run. In 1945, the Soviet Union supplied Czechoslovakia with cotton, wool, 9,300 tons of flax fiber, and more than 30,000 tons of potassium compounds (industrial and cooking salt). This was before the first Soviet-Czech trade agreement was concluded in 1946.

    In July 1946, a delegation of the Czechoslovak government headed by Gottwald visited Moscow for the first time. After a short period of consultation, they brought back huge gifts. The Soviet Union abandoned the spoils of war it had obtained from factories built by German invaders, including many modern machines, factories, and equipment. The most important was the huge oil refinery, which workers renamed the "Stalin Oil Refinery" in gratitude for Soviet assistance.

    After the second visit to Moscow by a delegation of the Czech government headed by Gottwald in July 1947, the Soviet Union shipped 40,000 tons of grain and 200,000 tons of feed to Czechoslovakia, saving the Czechoslovak people from the famine brought about by the 1947 crop failure.

    In 1947, the Soviet Union and the Czech Republic concluded a five-year trade agreement, stipulating the annual exchange of goods worth a total of 10 billion crowns.

    In the first year that the Soviet-Czech trade agreement came into effect, the total value of exchanged goods had already exceeded it. The Soviet-Czech trade agreement in 1948 was further expanded, and the total value of exchanged goods reached 18 billion crowns in 1949, an increase of 80 percent.

    At the same time, the Soviet side has greatly increased the delivery of major raw materials, such as iron, chromium, manganese, non-ferrous metals, cotton, etc. The delivery of 300,000 tons of wheat, 20,000 tons of barley, 25,000 tons of cream, 25,000 tons of meat, tea, and other food products is guaranteed. The huge machines and equipment that Czechoslovakia could not buy in Western Europe as a result of the United States' policy of dividing Europe will also be supplied.

    On the other hand, Czechoslovakia has greatly increased the delivery of manufactured goods, especially light industrial products, such as textiles, glass, porcelain, and paper.

    In addition, the Soviet Union has provided loans to the Czech Republic to facilitate the import of major raw materials for industrial production, and the large-scale exchange of technical experience and inventions between the two countries has further promoted the rapid development of Czech industry.

    This is how the great Soviet Union selflessly helps its allies.

    Czechoslovakia, which was one of the world's ten major industrial production countries, is now steadily moving towards socialism thanks to the smooth implementation of the Five-Year Plan and the enthusiastic assistance of the great Soviet Union.

　　捷克斯洛伐克国民经济的发展
    彭卢
    捷克斯洛伐克人民共和国在成立之初，要恢复第二次大战期间完全被破坏的经济，面临着严重的困难。在共产党的领导下，这一新国家立即定下了克服困难的主要目标。就是保证国家的粮食供给，使业已锐减到战前水平百分之五十的工业生产增加起来，把工业转变为从事和平生产的工业，修建一切被破坏的工厂，并恢复对于紊乱的运输系统的管制。至于先前的通货贬值所造成的不值钱纸币泛滥的现象，那是比较容易处理的。这一任务在一九四五年末因币制改革而完成了。币制改革以三对一安定了新克郎兑换战前克郎的比率，同时，以相同的比率调整了物价、工资和薪津。
    捷克和斯洛伐克民族接受了苦难和鲜血所换来的历史经验的教训，解放以后，便将一切被没收的德寇、卖国贼和附逆者的财产归国家管制；一九四五年秋天，强迫执行了大规模的工业、矿场、银行和私营保险公司的国有化。国有化使（就相对的劳动力而言）全部工业的百分之六十和绝大部分的财源转移给人民大众了。握有着或控制着其他企业股票的工业的或银行业的企业也在国有化之列。在企业中，国家管制的开始及其后的国有化政策，不仅是人民民主的基本支柱，而且也是用以恢复全部经济的工具。在工人和劳动突击队的帮助下，战时被破坏的工厂加速修建起来，生产的和平改造迅速地完成了。战后第一次的收获完成了（靠城市人民的帮助很大），主要粮食的供给得到了保证。一九四五年，经济的最大困难——运输的阻碍渐渐地被克服了，工业的生产迅速地恢复了。就一九三七年的水平来说，工业生产从一九四五年的百分之五十增加到一九四六年五月的百分之六十，而一九四六年底则增加到百分之八十。值得注意的是战后人口比一九三七年减少了三百万，可是还达到了这样的成果。
    在这样的条件之下，进入经济计划的时期不仅是可能的，而且也是必要的。在一九四六年大选以前，哥特瓦尔德领导下的捷克共产党就酝酿了两年计划的草案，并以这个草案作为它的竞选宣言的主要纲领。捷克共产党竞选胜利之后，两年计划的草案便成为第一届哥特瓦尔德政府的行动计划了。几个月内，国会通过了两年计划，千百万人民关心着的两年计划终于在一九四六年十月二十八日公布了。
    两年计划
    两年计划的本质是什么呢？
    两年计划的目标是使捷克经济恢复到战前水平。因此，这主要的是一个经济恢复的计划。为要达到这个目标，一个短期的两年计划就足够了。二年计划所定的目标，在工业生产方面是要达到一九三七年水平百分之一百一十平均生产量；在农业生产方面，要达到战前水平的百分之一百；在运输方面要恢复一九三七年的运输量；在建筑方面，要建筑或修造一二○，○○○幢住宅，完成总值二百五十七亿三千万克郎的许多工业、运输和公共建筑。依照两年计划，各经济部门的主要劳动的人数如下：在工业生产中有二十七万人，在建筑工业中有九万人，在农业生产中有二十三万人。
    两年计划就作为“特殊目标”的一百一十种生产品规定了生产量。其他种类的生产品是间接计划的，一般地通过投资计划和原料与半制品的集中分配。为了达到这个目的，按照煤、铁、钢、电力和水泥等的情形，作出原料、半制品和电力的预算表，并准备劳动力的预算表。
    两年计划的一个重要部分是国外贸易计划。这给基本的出口贸易与进口贸易，定出了所应完成的任务。
    一九四七年一月一日，捷克劳动人民的伟大热情投入两年计划中，他们了解它向社会主义发展的深远的意义。两年计划的目标，特别是在工业和运输方面的（指大部分社会主义化的部门），从开始就一步步顺利地完成着。
    捷克斯洛伐克国内的反动势力完全明白两年计划对巩固人民民主和发展社会主义的前途上所具有的重要性，因此，反动分子（虽然他们不能公开出面），竭力企图破坏两年计划，使劳动人民对于伟大建设事业的热情和信心消减下去。尤其是他们利用自己在经济各部门中的地位，利用一九四七年不幸的歉收（那一年捷克经济损失在一百五十亿克郎以上），进行直接的怠工活动。他们的最终目标是要使经济紊乱，人民民主秩序崩溃，从而回复到战前资本主义的情况。在农业生产中、建筑业中和配给制度中，反动势力的怠工活动普遍得势。这些都是国有化还没有影响到的一些部门。
  二月政变胜利的影响
    二月政变的胜利，标志着捷克经济发展中一个新阶段的开始。这就是第二步国有化实行的阶段。第二步国有化包括着全部国内批发贸易，全部国外贸易和国际运输，以及五十个雇员以上的工业和其他的企业。有些特别重要的生产（如像医药的生产）则完全国有化了。
    在国有化第二阶段以后，捷克经济的社会主义成份大大地加强起来，包括所有工业百分之九十五，几乎百分之百的运输，百分之八十以上的建筑业和正在稳步增长着的零售业和游览事业等成份。
    经过了二月胜利，两年计划就顺利地被执行着。运输业超额完成了原定的任务。在工业方面——除了食品工业受着一九四七年歉收的影响，——全部两年计划的目标完成了百分之一百一十点五。在这样巨大的成就中，有七个部门超过了原定目标，其余四个部门仅略低于原定目标。但是，计划完成的百分比数字并不足以完全地正确地说明捷克工业的成长的，我们再看一看下面的材料：
    德寇的掠夺使捷克的工业劳动力减少很多。可是工业中的就业人数却超过了战前水平百分之三，因此，就一九三七年水平来说，工业生产力达到了百分之一百零四。更重要的事实是主要货物生产额超过了战前水平百分之三十。这种成就奠定了五年计划中全国工业得以大规模发展和改造的基础。与一九三七年的水平比较，生产量增加了百分之十八。
    如将一九三七年的生产量当作一百，则一九四八年各部门所达到的生产量的平均数字如下：工业部门    生产量          劳动力        生产力采矿        一一三·三      一四○·四      八○·七电力        一八三·九      一三五·二    一三六·○金属        一一七·八      一一七·一    一○○·六化学        一二四·○      一一七·一    一○五·九玻璃          八六·七        九二·四      九三·八建筑材料和陶器        一一七·五        七八·二    一五○·三造纸          九五·六      一○二·四      九三·四木柴          七七·○        九二·五      八三·二纺织品和衣着  七六·五        七八·五      九七·五皮革和橡皮  一一二·一      一一六·二      九六·五印刷        一一○·二      一○三·九    一六○·一

    两年计划的伟大成就使斯洛伐克的工业化完成了。失业消灭了。与一九三七年比较，一九四六年斯洛伐克的工业生产是百分之一百二十一，在两年计划完成时，增加到百分之二百二十五，而全国的生产只增加到百分之一百一十。以生产量来说，一九四六年在全部工业中，斯洛伐克应分配到百分之十二·八，在两年以后则为百分之十三·九。与一九四七年比较，一九四八年国家的收入在斯洛伐克增加了十五点三，在全部国家的收入中，斯洛伐克从百分之十八·七增加到百分之二十。每个人在国家的收入中从一九四六年每人九，五五六克郎增加到一九四八年每人一二，六○九克郎。这样一个成功的步骤，使斯洛伐克的社会水平与比较先进的捷克各省的社会水平，接近平均了。
    两年计划就这样成了捷克计划经济的伟大胜利。它完成了主要的生产目标，平均超过了战前生产水平百分之十。虽然一九四七年受到歉收的影响，两年计划还是提高了人民的生活水平。
  五年计划
    以上所说到的成就使捷克可能顺利地开始五年计划。同两年计划时期一样，在捷克共产党主席哥特瓦尔德的领导下，经济发展和改造的计划开始了。在二月政变人民获得胜利和一九四八年大选胜利之后，五年计划，成了新民族阵线政府的计划中的主要纲领。在哥特瓦尔德当选总统和萨波托斯基任总理之后，一九四八年十月二十八日（捷克斯洛伐克共和国成立三十周年纪念日）公布了千百万劳动人民所渴望的五年计划。这个五年计划于一九四九年一月一日开始实行，是捷克斯洛伐克走向社会主义的动力。
    两年计划与五年计划的区别怎样呢？两年计划首先求谋着经济的重建和恢复，至于五年计划则要实现经济的改造和未来发展，其最终目的是要在生产增加的情况下，更进一步提高城市和乡村劳动人民的生活水准，在这样的基础上，工人，农民，知识分子和城市的中间阶级的团结更加巩固了。
    在捷克斯洛伐克人民民主主义走向社会主义的发展中，五年计划代表着一个重要的阶段。特别是就加强和巩固国有化的工业来说，就走向国家的机器化和电气化来说，五年计划奠定了各经济部门中更先进的生产方法的初步基础，同时，通过了五年计划，所有的国营经济部门中，残留着的资本主义成份会逐渐地被限制被消灭。
    五年计划已经变成了工人阶级和劳动人民奠定社会主义基础的有力武器。它将有助于发展捷克经济的社会主义成份，限制和消灭资本主义成份，提高劳动生产力到一个没有先例的程度，并为新的劳动方法的发展创造条件。广大的劳动人民提出了一个具体的口号：“五年计划——我们走向社会主义的道路。”
    捷克斯洛伐克的经济必须按照全新的标准和国内与国外的新情况来发展。哥特瓦尔德说的话可作参考，他说：
    “捷克斯洛伐克经济结构的一切根源，大部份是奥匈帝国时代的和为适应那个时代而设计的。必须加以改造和调整，才能适应今天政治经济的情况。这就是说，要使战前可在国际市场上竞争，依靠吃不饱的工资的那些工业部门改变过来（如手套，玩具等的制造厂，特别是纺织和玻璃工业），领导它走向对我们的情况有利的工业上去，这样就可能使这些部门的生产占有国际市场，如像金属工业的情况，特别着重于重工业和化学工业。……”
    五年计划将使这样的经济结构的改变成为可能。改造和增加生产的中心是金属工业，五年以后，它的生产量将加到超过一九四八年水平百分之九十三，一九四八年的水平已大大超过战前的水平了；重工业的生产量将增加四倍。这样大的增长要求重工业的其他部门先有相当的生产量的增加，如像采矿，铸造，电力和化学。这并不是说，消费品工业将被限制或停顿；按照整个经济的过剩的需要，它的增长率是不很快的。
    就一九四八年的水平来说，在五年计划中，各工业部门生产量的增长在下表中得到了说明：
    工业      生产量的增长（％）        工业      生产品的增长（％）
    采矿      三五  化学      六二
    电力      五二  玻璃      一二
    铸造      四九  建筑材料和陶器      一二
    金属      九三  纸        四一
    木工      二六  酿造厂    六八
    纺织品和衣着        六八  面粉厂    三○
    皮革和橡皮          四三  食品      七九
    印刷      一八  工艺生产  二○
    软片      五六  总的工业  五七
    炼糖厂    一七  主要的货物          六六
            消费品  五○
    捷克工业结构在改造过程中，因为依照着和苏联与人民民主国家进行贸易的方针，是更进一步地得到调整了。不但国内经济危机得以消灭——而且从国外贸易带来的经济危机“波及”的可能性也消灭了。
    在五年计划中，农业生产方面的经济结构也将有所改变，重心越加着重于更有利的和有价值的家畜的生产。农业总生产量将超过一九四八年水平百分之三十八，农作物的生产只增加百分之十一，而家畜生产将增加百分之八十六。
    显然，这些经济结构的改变需要着大量投资，五年计划规定投资总值达三三六二亿克郎，这个投资总值分配如下：
    工业          一三九九亿克郎
    农业          二六八亿克郎
    建筑业        四六亿克郎
    运输业        五二九亿克郎
    贸易和游览事业          五○亿克郎
    房屋建造      三九三亿克郎
    社会福利      八一亿克郎
    保健和国营保险          一○三亿克郎
    文化          一○二亿克郎
    道路和桥梁，工业制氢设备，公共建筑设计和其他公共经营事业的投资
        四七一亿克郎
    此外，五十亿克郎划作地方政府的计划之用，主要的是为着小城镇和乡村的改善；这些计划的完成，不致改变其他部门的劳动力，因为这主要是通过人民自愿而出力的。
    所有这些计划的完成将使国家收入，从一九四八年的二一○○亿克郎提高到一九五三年的三一○○亿克郎，即增加百分之四十八。
    劳动生产力在五年中的增加目标大约如下：工业方面要增加百分之三十二，农业和森林百分之二十，建筑百分之五十三，运输百分之三十。五年计划又作出了原料、主要的半制品和电力的预算表，比二年计划中的更详细；整个五年计划在劳动力的预算表中，规定在工业中进用工人人数增加百分之十八，在农业和森林业中减低百分之四，在建筑业中增加百分之五十，在运输业中增加百分之六。
    国外贸易远较二年计划时期更适合于现实，主要地是由于进出口贸易完全从资本家手中拿过来，单独由国营公司来经营；又由于国外贸易量对有计划经济的国家的分配比率是在增加着。和这些国家缔结的长期贸易协定使捷克斯洛伐克得以正确地计划相互的进出口贸易。
    在五年计划中，社会消费（国民保险，社会福利，保健和文化。）和在国内配给制中个人消费的计划，也开始出现了。
    因为捷克斯洛伐克五年计划是伟大胜利的计划，包括着并指导着整个社会的发展，所以它可能动员有智慧的劳动人民，实现建设社会主义的伟大任务。
    团结一致的劳动人民是捷克斯洛伐克经济发展中的主要因素。在捷克共产党领导下的工人阶级，自从解放以来，一直起着带头作用，更好更快地完成着国家建设任务。
    从一九四五年到一九四八年之间，几百万捷克斯洛伐克人民在共产党的领导下，参加志愿劳动突击队。先后进行了“百万工作小时”和“三千万工作小时”等义务劳动竞赛，在工业中，城市中和农村中，义务劳动竞赛总计超过七亿六千万工作小时。
    此外，提高生产量和减低成本等运动也在许多工厂中普遍展开，工人们都是自愿地提高自己的劳动生产率的。
  苏联对捷克斯洛伐克的援助
    捷克斯洛伐克解放以后，苏联立刻供给它主要原料；要是没有这些原料，捷克斯洛伐克是完全不可能开始生产的。在解放的时候，运输完全解体了，修复的几条铁路的军运非常拥挤。尽管如此，早在一九四五年八月，苏联交付了一四，○○○吨铁砂给捷克斯洛伐克，一九四五年年底，更交付了七六，○○○吨的铁砂和九，○○○吨的锰。没有这些原料，捷克斯洛伐克的工业是无法生产的。
    不仅在工业部门苏联使捷克斯洛伐克的机器转动起来。在一九四五年，苏联供给捷克斯洛伐克棉花，羊毛，九千三百吨亚麻纤维，三万多吨钾的化合物（工业用的和烹调用的盐）。这还是在一九四六年第一次苏捷贸易协定缔结以前的事。
    一九四六年七月，哥特瓦尔德为首的捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团第一次访问莫斯科。经过短期协商之后，带回了巨大的礼物。苏联放弃了从德寇所建立的工厂中得到的战利品，包括许多现代的机器，工厂和设备。最重要的是巨大的炼油厂，工人们为了感激苏联的帮助，把这厂改名为“斯大林炼油厂”。
    一九四七年七月，哥特瓦尔德为首的捷克政府代表团第二次访问莫斯科之后，苏联运送了四万吨谷物和二十万吨饲料给捷克斯洛伐克，使捷克斯洛伐克人民免于一九四七年的歉收所带来的饥饿。
    一九四七年，苏捷两国缔结了五年贸易协定，规定每年交换总值一百亿克郎的货物。
    在苏捷贸易协定开始生效的第一年，交换货物的总值已经超过了。一九四八年苏捷贸易协定更扩大了一步，一九四九年交换货物的总值达一八○亿克郎，这就是增加了百分之八十。
    同时，苏联方面对于主要原料，如铁、铬、锰、非铁金属，棉花等等的交货大大增加了，三十万吨小麦，二万吨大麦，二万五千吨奶油，二万五千吨肉类和茶叶以及其他食物制品的交货是保证供给的，还有由于美国分裂欧洲政策的结果，捷克斯洛伐克在西欧不能买到的一些巨大机器和设备也将得到了供给。
    另一方面，捷克斯洛伐克已经大大地增加了制造品的交货，特别是轻工业生产品，如纺织品、玻璃、瓷器和纸张等货物。
    此外，苏联更贷款给捷克，使其工业生产的主要原料的进口得到便利，而两国关于技术经验和创造发明的大规模交换，更其促进了捷克斯洛伐克工业的迅速发展。
    伟大的苏联是这样大公无私地帮助自己的盟友的。
    捷克斯洛伐克本是全世界主要的十个工业生产国家之一，现在，由于五年计划的顺利执行，和伟大苏联的热心援助，正在走向社会主义的道路上稳步地前进着。（本文取材于布拉格出版的《走向社会主义的捷克》）
