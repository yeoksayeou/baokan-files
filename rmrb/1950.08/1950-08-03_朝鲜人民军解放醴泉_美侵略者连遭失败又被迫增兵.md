　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd—The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a battle report on the morning of August 1st: The People's Army, advancing towards Yecheon in Gyeongsangbuk-do, completely liberated Yecheon County in northern Gyeongsangbuk-do on July 31st after defeating the stubborn resistance of the US military. In the battle to liberate Yecheon, the majority of the enemy forces were killed or captured, and a large amount of spoils were seized.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th—TASS, New York, 27th—American journalists, in recent reports, frequently mention the large-scale activities of guerrillas in South Korea. A New York Times reporter wrote from Busan: The activities of local guerrillas began even before large units of the People's Army's tanks and infantry reached the suburbs of Mokpo. The heads of the American military delegation who fled from Gwangju to Busan also reported the activities of guerrillas, workers, and students. The head of the American military delegation pointed out: When the US military was retreating, guerrillas were extremely active on the road from Gwangju to Suncheon.
　　According to a United Press report from Washington: Representatives of the American military declared at a press conference that guerrillas had been active in most of the territory of South Korea. The area of their activities extended northward from Busan to the front line, and surrounded Geochang County, all the way to the west and southeast of Daegu.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd—The US government is continuing to send reinforcements to Korea in an attempt to save its invading forces from being driven into the sea. According to an Associated Press report: A unit of the US 2nd Infantry Division arrived in South Korea from the United States on July 31st and landed at the port of Busan on the same day. United Press International, Tokyo, reported that the US 1st Marine Division also arrived at a certain port in South Korea from the United States on August 1st. The landed troops of the US 2nd Infantry Division were quickly transported to the front lines by trains and automobiles. Associated Press reporter Whitehead, in a report on July 31st about the arrival of American reinforcements, admitted that the new troops "cannot reverse the unfavorable war trend for the US military." The New York Herald Tribune still worriedly said: "The landing of the Second Division has by no means ended the military crisis in Korea."

　　朝鲜人民军解放醴泉
    美侵略者连遭失败又被迫增兵
    【新华社平壤二日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部八月一日晨发表战报称：向庆尚北道醴泉方面进攻的人民军在击破美军的顽抗后，于七月三十一日完全解放了庆尚北道北部的醴泉县。在解放醴泉的战斗中，毙俘大部敌军，卤获战利品甚多。
    【新华社二十八日讯】塔斯社纽约二十七日讯：美国记者在最近的报道中，经常提到游击队在南朝鲜的大规模活动。纽约时报记者自釜山写道：当地游击队的活动在人民军队的大队坦克和步兵到达木浦城郊之前即已开始。从光州逃到釜山的美国军事代表团的首脑们，也曾报告过游击队、工人与学生的活动。美国军事代表团团长指出：当美军在撤退的时候，游击队在从光州到顺天的路上极为活跃。
    据合众社驻华盛顿记者报道：美国的军界代表在记者招待会上宣称：游击队曾在南朝鲜的大部分领土上活动。他们活动的地区从釜山向北一直扩展到前线，并且包围了居昌县，直到大邱以西及东南一带。
    【新华社二日讯】美国政府正继续增调援军赶赴朝鲜，以挽救其侵略部队被逐下海的命运。据美联社讯：美国步兵第二师一部已于七月三十一日自美国运抵南朝鲜，即日在釜山港登陆。合众社东京电称：美国海军陆战队第一师亦于八月一日自美国到达南朝鲜某港。登陆的美步兵第二师部队已分乘火车与汽车匆匆投入前线。美联社记者怀特亥七月三十一日在报道美国援兵登陆的消息时承认：新来的军队尚“不能把不利于美军的战争趋势扭转”。纽约先驱论坛报仍忧虑地说：“第二师的登陆，绝未结束朝鲜的军事危机。”
