Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 23rd: The International Union of Students specially sponsored the World Student Exhibition during the Second World Student Congress, which opened on the 17th in Prague, Czechoslovakia.

	The exhibition rooms of the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies are characterized by the healthy and happy lives of students and the brilliant achievements of domestic peaceful construction. This is in stark contrast to the enslavement and persecution of progressive students in capitalist, colonial, and dependent countries today.

	In the Chinese exhibition room, a large red banner reading "Chinese Students Advancing Under the Banner of Mao Zedong" hangs high. The room displays dozens of photographs documenting the Chinese student movement since the May Fourth Movement, students receiving democratic education and participating in the peace signature campaign after liberation, the visit of the Soviet Komsomol to China, and the new atmosphere of the new China after liberation. Many New Year pictures, sculptures and other works of art were also on display. An African student representative from Nigeria wrote in the suggestion book: "The heroic struggle of the Chinese people to liberate themselves from the shackles of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries is a shining example for people of color who are still fighting for peace, democracy, and national independence today."

	Representatives of progressive students from all over the world and citizens of Prague visited the Korean exhibition room with mixed feelings of sorrow and excitement. The room displayed fragments of bombs used by the United States to massacre the Korean people, photographs documenting the terrorist acts of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique in South Korea and the indiscriminate bombing of the Korean people by American aircraft, as well as carbines, rifles, grenade launchers, and uniforms with epaulettes captured by the Korean People's Army from the US military. Beside the Korean map filled with victorious red flags, visitors crowded to see the charts and photographs of Korean youth enthusiastically joining the army and the heroic resistance of the Korean people.

	In the Vietnamese exhibition room, photographs were displayed showing the Vietnamese people engaged in combat and production construction in difficult circumstances, as well as efforts and achievements in eliminating illiteracy. The demonstrations by Saigon students, and the photos of awakened French soldiers joining the ranks of the Vietnamese people to fight side-by-side against American and French imperialism, were particularly eye-catching.

	Progressive American students used large-scale drawings to call for peace and support the just war of the Korean people. There was a display of the original text of the peace signature book, which was banned by the US government from being distributed in schools, next to which was written the powerful phrase "US troops get out of Korea!" Various eye-catching tables exposed the fascist measures of the US government, such as banning progressive books, racial discrimination in employment and education, military training in schools, and a comparison of military spending and education funding in the budget.

　　世界学生展览会已在布拉格开幕
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】在第二届世界学生代表大会开会期间，国际学联特主办了世界学生展览会，于十七日在捷京布拉格开幕。
    苏联和东欧人民民主国家的展览室的特色，是学生们健康幸福的生活，和国内和平建设的辉煌成就。这与今天资本主义及殖民地与附属国内进步学生的受奴役、迫害的情形，恰好是两个世界的鲜明对比。
    在中国展览室里，高悬着“在毛泽东旗帜下前进的中国学生”的红色大幅标语。室内陈列了数十幅记载五四以来中国学生运动，解放后学生接受民主教育与参加和平签名运动，苏联共产主义青年团访问中国，以及解放后新中国的新气象的若干照片。并陈列了许多年画、雕刻等艺术品。一位非洲尼日利亚的学生代表在意见簿上写道：“中国人民从美帝国主义和国民党反动派枷锁下解放自己的英勇斗争，是今天仍在为和平、民主与民族独立而斗争的有色人种的光辉范例。”
    全世界进步学生的代表和布拉格的市民，都以悲愤与兴奋交织的心情参观了朝鲜展览室。室内陈列着美国屠杀朝鲜人民的炸弹碎片，记录美帝国主义和李承晚集团在南朝鲜的恐怖行为和美机滥炸朝鲜人民的照片，和朝鲜人民军缴获的美军的卡宾枪、步枪、掷弹筒和带着肩章的军衣。在插满了胜利的红旗的朝鲜地图旁边，参观者拥挤着争看朝鲜青年踊跃参军和朝鲜人民英勇抗战的图表和照片。
    在越南的展览室里，陈列了越南人民在艰苦环境下从事战斗和生产建设，以及扫除文盲的努力和成绩的照片。西贡学生的游行示威，和觉悟了的法国士兵参加越南人民的行列，为反对美、法帝国主义而并肩作战的照片，特别引人注目。
    美国进步学生以大幅图画呼吁和平和支持朝鲜人民的正义战争。那儿陈列着被美国政府禁止在学校里传播的和平签名书的原文，旁边写着“美军滚出朝鲜去！”的有力字句。各种醒目的表格，揭露了美国政府的法西斯措施，诸如查禁进步书籍，职业和教育上的种族歧视，学校中的军事训练以及预算中军费和教育经费的对比等等。
