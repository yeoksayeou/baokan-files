　　"The Military and Political Consequences of Atomic Energy"
    (By [Patrick Maynard Stuart] Blackett, translated by Ming Jin et al.)
    Since American imperialism dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the U.S. imperialists have been promoting them vigorously, portraying the atomic bomb as a mysterious "magic weapon," as if it could "reverse the universe" with this magic weapon. The American imperialists, pretending to be "saviors," clung to the atomic bomb, shouting that it was a "sacred trust" (Truman's words). In this way, the myth of the atomic bomb spread like a plague.
    Professor Blackett's book, "The Military and Political Consequences of Atomic Energy" (translated by World Knowledge Press), exposes the mysterious cloak of the atomic bomb, shatters the fallacy of atomic bomb supremacy, and at the same time explains the true face of imperialist atomic diplomacy.
    Professor Blackett is a famous contemporary British physicist, and he has made outstanding discoveries in nuclear radiation and cosmic rays. In August 1945, he was appointed as a member of the British Atomic Energy Advisory Committee. However, as the author stated, "After the hopeful beginning represented by the Attlee-Truman-King declaration in November 1945 and the establishment of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission in January of the following year, I found that my views diverged more and more from those of my colleagues." "The political consequences of the path that British and American policies—because they seem to be the same in the main points—were following were potentially as tragic as their military basis was unrealistic." Therefore, after the British Atomic Energy Commission was abolished, he wrote this valuable work based on his own research.
    The propaganda of American and British imperialism about the atomic bomb attempts to instill in people the impression that "the atomic bomb is irresistible," thereby achieving the purpose of intimidating and enslaving the people of the world. In this regard, Professor Blackett cited the official records of American and British imperialists to illustrate the extent of the damage caused by atomic bombs to peaceful residents. However, during the war against Hitler's Germany, the Allied bombing of Germany was equivalent to the destructive power of four hundred atomic bombs, and this bombing did not play a decisive role in defeating Hitler's Germany. The author affirmed the effect of atomic bomb attacks on threatening people and pointed out that the prevailing view in the United States was: "The purpose of the offensive is to kill people." This exposed the most shameless and ferocious faces of the imperialist bandits. From Blackett's analysis, the following conclusion is drawn: the atomic bomb is only a weapon for slaughtering people, but it cannot solve the war, so the people must demand that it be banned.
    The book used a special chapter, "The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb," to expose a historical conspiracy—"the reasons why the United States 'decided to drop atomic bombs on two Japanese cities.'" He cited abundant documents and eloquently stated that "no compelling military reasons were found." "But a most compelling diplomatic reason, related to the balance of power in the post-war world, was clearly visible." "Frankly speaking, we concluded that the atomic bombing was not the last military action of World War II, but rather the first action of the cold war of anti-Soviet diplomacy that is now underway." This is a very pertinent remark.
    Deceiving oneself is one of the tricks commonly used by American and British imperialism in propagandizing the atomic bomb. The warmongers arrogantly attempt to use the atomic bomb to intimidate the people of the world, and on the other hand, they vigorously spread rumors about what would happen if the Soviet Union had atomic bombs, thereby creating a sense of fear among the people. Professor Blackett listed detailed information and compared the foreign policies of the Soviet Union with those of American and British imperialism. He explained how the Soviet Union was fighting for peace, and how American and British imperialism attempted to use the atomic bomb to dominate the world. The book specifically analyzes the negotiations on international atomic energy control and the reasons for its failure in detail. It pointed out how the Baruch Plan proposed by American imperialism delayed the destruction of atomic bombs, maintained its hegemony over atomic energy, prevented atomic energy from being used for peaceful purposes, and used the United Nations as a cover to establish a spy system against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. However, all the rumors, deceptions, and intimidation of American and British imperialism can only expose the ferocious faces of the blood-drinking warmongers and increase the international prestige of the Soviet Union. This conclusion has been increasingly proven by facts.
    The shortcoming of this book is that the author did not analyze and explain the various political and military issues related to atomic energy from a socio-economic perspective, and individual arguments in the book are not entirely correct. However, the author faithfully tells us the truth about atomic energy and the military and political consequences related to atomic energy from scientific and rich international documents. In today's era when imperialism is promoting how great the atomic bomb is and intimidating and slandering the people, this book is worth reading.
    "The Military and Political Consequences of Atomic Energy" has been sent by the British Peace Committee to the International Peace Prize Review Council of the World Congress in Defense of Peace to be held in Prague in the second half of August this year, which has its significance.

　　《原子能的军事和政治后果》
    （英·勃兰凯特著明今等合译）
    自从美帝国主义在广岛和长崎丢下两颗原子弹以后，美帝便大肆宣传，把原子弹描写成神秘的“法宝”，好像靠这法宝就可以“旋转乾坤”似的。美帝国主义者，又装出“救世主”的样子，死抱住原子弹，高喊这是“神圣的咐托”（杜鲁门语）。这样，原子弹的神话，就好像瘟疫似的传播开来了。
    英国勃兰凯特教授所著《原子能的军事和政治后果》（世界知识社译本）一书，正是揭破了原子弹神秘的外衣，粉碎了原子弹至上的鬼话，同时更说明了帝国主义原子外交的真象。
    勃兰凯特教授是英国当代著名的物理学家，他对核子放射和宇宙线有卓越的发现。一九四五年八月，他被任为英国原子能顾问委员会的委员。然而，如作者所述，“到了一九四五年十一月艾德礼——杜鲁门——金氏的宣言所代表的有希望的开始与次年一月联合国原子能委员会设立后，我发觉我的看法和我的同僚们的看法分歧得愈来愈远了。”“英美的政策——因为在主要各点上两者似乎一样的——所正在遵循的路线，其政治后果之可能悲惨，正如其军事基础的不现实一样。”因此，当英国原子能委员会被撤销以后，他根据自己研究所得，写成了这本很有价值的著作。
    美英帝国主义关于原子弹的宣传，企图给人们灌输一种“原子弹是不可抵御”的印象，从而达到恫吓、奴役全世界人民的目的。在这方面，勃兰凯特教授引证了美英帝国主义者的官方纪录，说明原子弹对和平居民的破坏程度。但在对希特勒德国作战时，盟国对德的轰炸，抵得上四百颗原子弹的破坏力，而这轰炸并没有对击溃希特勒德国起了什么决定性的作用。著者肯定原子弹轰炸对于人民威胁的效果，并指出在美国盛行的观点是：“进攻的目的是在杀戮人民”。这暴露了帝国主义强盗们最无耻、最狰狞的面目。从勃兰凯特的分析中，引出了这样一个结论：原子弹只是屠杀人民的凶器，但不能解决战争，因而人民必须要求予以禁用。
    本书曾以一个专章：“使用原子弹的决定”，揭露了一个历史阴谋——美帝“决定去向日本两个城市投掷原子弹的原委”。他引用了丰富的文件，雄辩地说明“没有找到什么迫不得已的军事理由”。“但是一个最迫不得已的外交理由，有关战后世界中权力均势者，倒是明显地可以看得清清楚楚。”“老实地说，我们便归结到原子弹的投掷，并不是第二次世界大战的最后一次军事行动，而倒像是现在进行中的对苏外交冷战的第一次行动。”这真是一针见血的话。
    掩耳盗铃，正是美英帝国主义宣传原子弹惯用的诡计之一。战争贩子，狂妄地企图利用原子弹吓诈全世界人民，另一方面又大力散播苏联如有原子弹会如何如何的谰言，从而在人民中间，造成一种恐惧心理。勃兰凯特教授，列举了详细的资料，把苏联和美英帝国主义的对外政策，做了比较。他说明苏联如何为和平而斗争，而美英帝国主义如何企图利用原子弹霸占世界。书中特别对国际原子能管制的谈判及其失败的原因分析得很详细。指出美国帝国主义所提出的巴鲁区计划，怎样拖延毁销原子弹，保持它对原子能的霸权，又怎样阻止原子能用于和平，并利用联合国做幌子以建立对苏联及人民民主国家的间谍制度。但是，所有美英帝国主义的造谣、欺骗、恫吓，其结果只能暴露了战争贩子喝血的狰狞面目，提高了苏联的国际威信。这个论断，已日益为事实所证明了。
    这本书的缺点，在于作者没有从社会经济方面分析说明有关原子能所产生的种种政治和军事的问题，书中个别论点，也不是完全正确的。然而，作者从科学和丰富的国际文件中，忠实地告诉我们原子能的真象，以及有关原子能的军事和政治后果，在帝国主义宣传原子弹如何了不起、对人民进行恫吓诽谤的今天，这本书是值得一读的。
    《原子能的军事和政治后果》一书，已由英国和平委员会寄到本年八月下半月将在布拉格举行的世界拥护和平大会国际和平奖金评议会去，这是有它的意义的。
