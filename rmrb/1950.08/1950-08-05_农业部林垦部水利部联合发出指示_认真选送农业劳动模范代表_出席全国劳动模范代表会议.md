Xinhua News Agency, August 4th - According to the State Council's decision to convene a National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, and the Preparatory Committee for the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers' plan for convening the National Congress, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation, and the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government jointly issued instructions on the selection of agricultural representatives on the 4th of this month. The full text of the instructions is as follows:
	(1) The Northeast, Northwest, North China, East China, Central South, and Southwest Administrative Regions shall, through their respective military and political committee's agricultural and forestry departments, in conjunction with the animal husbandry departments (Northwest Region only), water resources departments, and major river basin water conservancy agencies, promptly decide on the quota of representatives allocated to each province and notify each province. Each province shall then, according to the allocated quota (the quota for the five provinces in North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shall be as stipulated in the plan), through the agricultural and forestry departments in conjunction with relevant departments such as the animal husbandry department, water conservancy bureau, river affairs bureau, and aquatic products bureau, discuss and determine the representative evaluation methods for each province and region, and immediately carry out the collection of representative deeds materials, summary of production experience, and mobilization of elections. This work must be combined with the election of industrial labor model representatives and People's Liberation Army labor model representatives under the unified leadership of the military and political committees and provincial people's governments of the major administrative regions.
	(2) Among the agricultural labor model representatives, consideration should be given to various aspects of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and aquatic products, such as representatives of intensive cultivation, prevention and control of diseases and pests, animal pests, various special products, dike repair and flood fighting, canal construction and irrigation, etc., and consideration should also be given to ethnic production representatives in minority ethnic areas; at the same time, attention must also be paid to the actual local production situation to select appropriate representatives, preventing egalitarianism. The elected representatives must be figures who have truly achieved results and are recognized by the masses in the actual production movement; those without appropriate conditions should not be selected, or should be designated as non-voting delegates.
	(3) Agricultural labor model representatives include the masses directly participating in production, cadres organizing and leading agricultural production, and scientific and technological research workers; however, mass labor models are the main focus. Among the elected conditions, intensive cultivation refers to those who cultivate, rake, and hoe more often, and improve cultivation techniques to increase yield; the introduction of new varieties refers to those who first introduce new varieties or self-select new varieties that are recognized by the masses as having high yield, good quality, and strong resistance to adverse environmental conditions; technical workers who use scientific methods to breed new varieties, which are confirmed to be excellent through comparative and regional trials, and are welcomed by farmers after promotion; water conservancy models should include labor models in projects such as building dikes, dams and sluices, flood prevention and rescue, river dredging and drainage, canal excavation and well drilling, and those who have made special achievements in surveying, soil testing, instrument manufacturing, and tool improvement, or have inventions and creations in technology and academics; pest and disease prevention models include those who have achieved significant results in fighting wolves, wild boars, and other wild animals that endanger people and crops, and those who have made creations in disease and pest veterinary research work that have been promoted with significant results; land improvement and rational use of wasteland include converting mountain slopes into terraced fields, transforming saline-alkali, sandy, and wasteland into fertile land, adopting crop rotation to transform barren land into fertile land, and planting suitable crops for both agriculture and animal husbandry to obtain full benefits; rational forest harvesting includes those who have made significant achievements in mountain field transportation, forest railway transportation, water transportation, and timber production. All localities should conduct elections based on specific conditions and the models that emerge in the actual production movement. Others with special contributions not listed in the elected conditions may also be elected.
	(4) Labor model representatives should focus on old areas and areas with a better foundation for production movements. Due to time constraints, the selection of representatives can generally adopt an evaluation method. The evaluation is divided into two levels, the special district level and the provincial level, with the special districts and provinces convening labor models and leading production cadres to jointly evaluate. After the work is arranged, the province should immediately send appropriate personnel to assist and guide the local evaluation, collect representative materials, and summarize production experiences. The writing methods and styles of charts and other materials should preferably be uniformly stipulated by the major administrative regions.
	(5) After the labor model evaluation work in each province is completed, it should be reported to the major administrative regions. The major administrative regions shall review and submit them to the Preparatory Committee for the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers on schedule. The provinces in North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region shall directly submit them to the Preparatory Committee for the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. When labor model representatives gather to come to Beijing, the major administrative regions should uniformly send people to lead and receive them; the provinces in North China and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should send people to lead and receive them. The team leader must be a capable and responsible cadre to maintain close contact with the labor models during the meeting. When departing, the major administrative regions and provinces can hold symposiums, farewell parties, etc., but be careful not to excessively affect the production time of the model representatives.
	(6) Provinces and regions that have decided to hold labor model conferences in the autumn should combine them with this evaluation work, learn from experience, and better prepare.
