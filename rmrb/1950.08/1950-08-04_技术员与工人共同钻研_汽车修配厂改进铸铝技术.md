　　Technicians and Workers Jointly Study
    Automobile Repair Shop Improves Aluminum Casting Technology
    [Our Newspaper] Beijing Automobile Repair Shop technician Gao Yuqin and workers jointly studied and discovered the reason for the high scrap rate of cast "aluminum pistons," and improved the process, solving the technical difficulties in production. Aluminum pistons are one of the main batch products of the factory. Because the workers lacked experience in aluminum casting, and the raw materials were sometimes American aluminum and sometimes Norwegian aluminum, the workers could not master the technical rules, and the scrap rate remained high. Moreover, because aluminum pistons had to be processed by the machinist before it could be inspected for defects, the machinists could not get extra bonuses due to the high scrap rate of the castings, which affected their production enthusiasm. Therefore, the high scrap rate of aluminum pistons became a serious problem in the factory's production. In March, the factory administration sent technician Gao Yuqin to be responsible for solving this technical problem. After Gao arrived at the workshop, he engaged in various operations. He participated in heavy work such as digging coal and working near the high-temperature furnace, and he was unpretentious and had an honest style, which won the love of the workers, so he gradually integrated with the workers. He was willing to study in actual operation, and often studied problems with his colleagues, providing technical theoretical guidance. Over the past three months, under his leadership, the workers have continuously studied and discovered several reasons for the high scrap rate of aluminum pistons, and have continuously experimented and improved the process, which has significantly reduced the scrap rate. The average scrap rate of T-234 aluminum pistons in May and June was 26.5%, and from July 1st to 8th, the average scrap rate had been reduced to 16.5%. From then on, the foundation for the factory to completely solve the technical problem of aluminum casting was laid. (Zhou Linwen)

    汽车修配厂改进铸铝技术
    【本报讯】北京汽车修配厂技术员高玉琴与工人共同研究，发现了铸制“铝活塞”废品多的原因，并加以改进，解决了生产技术上的困难。铝活塞为该厂主要成批产品之一，由于工人没有铸铝经验，且原料有时用美国铝有时用挪威铝，工人不能掌握技术规律，废品一直很多。且因铝活塞铸成后必须机工间加工后才能检验出是否废品，机工间工人也因铸品废品率大得不到超额奖励，影响了生产情绪。因之，铝活塞废品多成为该厂生产上一个严重问题。三月间该厂行政方面派技术员高玉琴负责解决这个技术问题。高到车间后便从事各种操作。他参加掏煤、在高温的炉边工作等重头活，而且不摆架子，作风老实，得到了工人群众的喜爱，因而渐和工人们打成了一片。他在实际操作中肯钻研，经常和工友一起研究问题，作技术理论指导。三个多月来，经他带领工人不断研究，发现了铝活塞废品多的几个原因，不断地试验和改进，才使废品率显著减低了。Ｔ——二三四铝活塞，五、六两月平均废品率是百分之二十六点五，到七月份一至八日，平均废品率已降低为百分之十六点五。从此，打下了该厂彻底解决铸铝技术问题的基础。  （周林文）
