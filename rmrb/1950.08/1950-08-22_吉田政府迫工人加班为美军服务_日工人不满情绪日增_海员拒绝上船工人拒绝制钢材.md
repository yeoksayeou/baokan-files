Xinhua News Agency, August 21st:

    The United States, after launching its war of aggression against Korea, has intensified its oppression of Japanese laborers, which has aroused opposition from Japanese workers. According to a compilation of reports from the Japanese United News Agency: Since the outbreak of the Korean War, temporary workers have been mobilized in the maritime, railway, shipbuilding, automobile, gunpowder, and military base construction industries in Japan. The ruling authorities have been forcing them to work overtime, often all night, and have suspended their vacations. As a result, resentment is brewing in many factories. Workers have already raised demands such as "granting vacations." Among sailors, there have been instances of refusing to board ships, mass absenteeism, and refusing to work overtime. The Wakamatsu branch of the Seamen's Union convened a meeting on July 5th of thirty representatives from over twenty ships, including the "Akiura" anchored in Wakamatsu Port (located in Fukuoka Prefecture), and resolved to oppose the use of Japanese ships in the war of aggression against Korea. Recently, workers at the Fuji factory of the Yawata Iron Works decided to refuse to manufacture steel that would be used by the US military in Korea.
    At the same time, the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign has been widely launched among the working class. Some union members affiliated with the so-called "General Council of Trade Unions of Japan" have also signed the declaration.

    【新华社二十一日讯】美国在发动侵略朝鲜战争后加强对日本劳工的压迫，已引起日本工人的反对。综合日本联合通讯社消息：朝鲜战争爆发后，日本海员、铁道、造船、汽车、火药、军事基地建设工程，都动员了临时工人。统治当局对他们都硬派留班（即不下班）工作，加班彻夜做工，并停止休假。因此，不满的情绪在许多工厂中酝酿着。工人已提出“给予休假”等要求。海员中发生了拒绝上船、大量旷工、拒绝留班加班等情形。海员工会若松支会曾于七月五日召集停泊在若松港（按在福冈县）内的“安艺浦”号等二十余艘船只的代表三十名，决议反对利用日本船只参加侵略朝鲜的战争。最近，八幡制铁所富士工厂的工人，决定拒绝制造将供朝鲜美军使用的钢材。
    同时，斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动已在工人阶级中广泛展开。所谓“日本工会总评议会”属下的一些工会会员，也在宣言上签了名。
