Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, August 22nd: The People's Governments at all levels in Shandong Province are now vigorously leading farmers in making preparations for the autumn harvest, in order to welcome an autumn harvest unseen in more than a decade.

This year, Shandong has had well-distributed rainfall and timely sowing. In addition, farmers in various places have actively prevented and controlled pests and diseases, weeded and fertilized more, so except for a few areas affected by floods, the autumn seedlings throughout the province are strong and show a promising harvest. According to estimates from the Laiyang, De County, Huimin, and Yishui districts, the average yield per mu of millet, sorghum, and other crops this year can reach about 200 jin. Early autumn crops in Linqu, Zou County, and other places have already been harvested. Last year, the highest yield of millet per mu in these areas was more than 160 jin. This year, the best yields are 400 jin per mu, and the general yields are also around 240 jin, an increase of about one-third.

With a promising harvest in sight, the People's Governments at all levels are currently vigorously leading farmers in making preparations for the autumn harvest. The Laiyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office issued an autumn harvest directive on August 8, calling on farmers to fully complete autumn harvest preparations, and also stipulating specific measures for consolidating and improving mutual aid organizations and selecting seeds. The CPC Wendeng Prefectural Committee and the Wendeng Prefectural Commissioner's Office also jointly dispatched 18 cadres on August 8 to go to key areas and villages in Wendeng, Muping, and Rushan counties to inspect and promote autumn harvest preparations. The Yixian County People's Government convened a county-wide district cadre meeting to prepare for the autumn harvest. At the meeting, based on the county's lack of livestock and farm tools, it was decided to organize men, women, old and young to start early, and to conscientiously organize cattle sharing, adjust and repair farm tools, so as to achieve "no idle cattle in every village, and every household busy with autumn plowing." The farmers in Lvjia Village, a model production village in Ju County, have formulated an autumn harvest plan, preparing to harvest all 180 mu of early autumn crops in the village within three days; in addition, they have organized ten cattle teams to prepare for autumn plowing while harvesting the autumn crops.

　　山东各地秋田丰收在望
    农民积极准备进行秋收
    【新华社济南二十二日电】山东省各地人民政府现正大力领导农民进行秋收准备工作，以迎接十余年来未有的秋田丰收。
    今年山东各地雨水调匀，播种及时，加以各地农民积极防治病虫灾害，多锄草多施肥，因此除少数水灾地区外，全省秋苗健壮，普呈丰收景象。据莱阳、德县、惠民、沂水等专区估计，今年谷子、高粱等作物每市亩平均产量均可达到二百斤左右。临沂邹县等地早秋且已登场。这些地方去年黍稷每亩最高产量为一百六十余斤，今年最好的每亩收四百斤，一般的也在二百四十斤左右，增产在三分之一上下。
    由于丰收在望，目前各地人民政府正大力领导农民进行秋收准备工作。莱阳专署曾于八月八日发布秋收指示，号召农民全力完成秋收准备，同时更规定整理和提高互助组织及选种工作等具体办法。中共文登地委和文登专署也于八月八日联合派出干部十八人，分赴文登、牟平、乳山三县有重点地深入区、村检查和推动秋收准备工作。峄县人民政府曾为迎接秋收而召开全县的区干部会议。会上根据该县缺乏牲口、农具的情况，决定组织男女老少及早动手，并认真地组织牛犋、调剂和增修农具，做到“村村无闲牛、户户忙秋耕”。莒县生产模范村吕家庄的农民已订出了秋收计划，准备在三天内收完全村一百八十亩早秋作物；另外又组织了十犋耕牛，准备在秋收同时进行秋耕。
