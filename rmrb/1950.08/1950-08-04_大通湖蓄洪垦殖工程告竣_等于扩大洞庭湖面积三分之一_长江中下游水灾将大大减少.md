Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 27th. The Datong Lake flood storage and reclamation project in Hunan has been successfully completed before the arrival of the Yangtze River flood season. The lake has now become a huge reservoir capable of holding 2.2 billion cubic meters of floodwater, quadrupling its flood storage capacity compared to previous years, which is equivalent to expanding the area of Dongting Lake by one-third. If, between July and August each year, approximately three-fifths of the flood flow between the Zhijiang Estuary and Songzi Estuary of the Yangtze River pours into Dongting Lake and cannot be contained, this reservoir can play its role in flood storage in a timely manner, reducing floods in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and along the Dongting Lake. In peacetime, the natural slope can be used to discharge the waterlogged water in Datong Lake to Dongting East Lake through the two channels that have been dug this time. After the waterlogged water is discharged, not only can 320,000 mu of waterlogged cultivated land be saved, but also 180,000 mu of fertile cultivated land can be added. If the drainage project is fully completed, cultivated land can be increased to 300,000 mu.

During the Kuomintang rule, the transverse dike of Datong Lake was started four times, but due to the corruption of the personnel in charge of dike repair, it was never completed. Therefore, during the continuous rain last summer, most of the 103 dikes around the lake collapsed, submerging 320,000 mu of cultivated land and displacing more than 100,000 farmers.

After the liberation of Hunan Province, the Provincial People's Government sent people to Datong Lake in early September last year to conduct on-site surveys and formulated a project plan for the Datong Lake Flood Storage and Reclamation Area. Under the extremely difficult circumstances of the national finance, with the approval of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government and the approval of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central and Southern Military and Political Committee, 15.5 million catties of rice were allocated as project funds, and the huge Datong Lake Flood Storage and Reclamation Project began in mid-January this year. With the enthusiastic support of more than 30,000 farmers, the entire transverse dike and canal digging project were basically completed by the end of March.

In order to ensure that Datong Lake truly achieves the purpose of flood storage, the Hunan Provincial People's Government issued a decision in early May on strictly implementing state-owned and state-operated, flood storage first, clearly stipulating that the main crop for reclamation in Datong Lake should be autumn wheat. No matter what kind of crop, it must be harvested before July 15th every year, and the products must be transported out of the lake for flood storage. The Datong Lake Flood Storage and Reclamation Management Office is now carrying out persuasion and education work to the masses through local people's representative conferences, farmer representative conferences, and public forums, etc., in accordance with the above instructions; and recently mobilized the residents in the lake to relocate from house to house. The provincial government has also decided to allocate 500,000 catties of rice as relocation expenses for the masses to resolutely ensure the implementation of the Datong Lake flood storage task.

　　大通湖蓄洪垦殖工程告竣
    等于扩大洞庭湖面积三分之一  长江中下游水灾将大大减少
    【新华社长沙二十七日电】湖南大通湖畜洪垦殖工程已在长江洪水到来前胜利完成。现该湖已成为一个可容纳洪水二十二亿立方公尺的巨大蓄水库，比往年增加蓄洪量四倍，等于扩大洞庭湖面积三分之一。如果每年七、八月间长江枝江口与松洪口间的洪水流量约五分之三由四口倒灌洞庭湖而无法容纳时，这一蓄水库便可及时发挥其蓄洪的作用，以减少长江中、下游和洞庭湖沿岸的水灾。在平时，则可利用自然坡度通过这次已挖好的两个渠道，把大通湖内的渍水向洞庭东湖排出。渍水排出后，不仅可救出渍水耕田三十二万亩，并能增加十八万亩肥沃耕地。如排水工程全部完成，可增加耕田达三十万亩。
    在国民党统治时期，大通湖横堤虽曾四次动工修筑，但因主管修堤人员的贪污舞弊，均未修成，因而去夏霪雨时，环湖一零三垸大部溃决，淹没耕地三十二万亩，使十多万农民流离失所。
    湖南省解放后，该省人民政府即于去年九月初便派人赴大通湖进行实地勘测，并制订了大通湖蓄洪垦殖区工程计划。在国家财政极端困难的情况下，经中央人民政府水利部批准，并经中南区军政委员会水利部核定大米一千五百五十万斤作为工程费，巨大的大通湖蓄洪垦殖工程遂于今年一月中旬开始。在三万多农民群众的热情支持下，全部横堤和挖渠工程到三月底便已基本完成。
    为保证大通湖真正达到蓄洪的目的，湖南省人民政府曾于五月初即发布了关于大通湖严格执行国有国营、蓄洪第一的决定，明确规定大通湖内垦殖以种秋麦为主，不论何种作物，均须于每年七月十五日以前收割完毕，并将产品运送出湖，以便蓄洪。大通湖蓄洪垦殖管理处现根据上述指示，通过当地各界人民代表会、农民代表会和民众座谈会等，向群众进行说服和教育工作；最近并挨户动员湖内居民迁移。省府并决定拨稻谷五十万斤作为群众迁家费，坚决保证执行大通湖蓄洪任务。
