To strengthen and improve the people's supervision work in the rectification campaign.
　　Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, the government organs and staff at all levels of our People’s Republic of China have, in the past year, taken over the vast new areas, established people’s power, suppressed bandits and secret agents, stabilized social order, supported the war, restored production, unified finance, stabilized finance and prices, overcome water and drought disasters, and strived to engage in the country’s various construction tasks, achieving many major successes. These achievements are primary and fundamental. On the other hand, we should also see that along with the great achievements, there are also shortcomings and errors in various tasks. In many of our government organs and enterprise departments, there are still varying degrees of bureaucratic and commandist tendencies that alienate them from the masses, as well as phenomena such as corruption, waste, and dereliction of duty by some staff members. The summary report of the work of the People’s Supervision Committee of the State Council of the Central People’s Government for the first half of the year shows that from last year to May of this year, according to incomplete statistics, more than 6,100 large and small incidents that should not have occurred happened in the central organs and major administrative regions. Although the reasons for these incidents are very complex, as the report says, many of them are "caused by the arrogance and complacency of some leaders, their paralysis and carelessness, especially their bureaucracy and commandism." "This kind of bureaucracy and commandism not only causes significant losses to the property of the state and the people, but also hinders the close relationship between the people's government and the broad masses of the people. Moreover, this kind of bureaucracy and commandism gives bandits, secret agent elements, and lawless elements an opportunity to exploit."
　　In response to these existing phenomena, the Chinese Communist Party is now gradually launching a rectification movement throughout the country and in party organizations at all levels, focusing on reviewing and summarizing work, to implement the instructions of the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the CPC, namely "to raise the ideological and political level of cadres and ordinary party members, to overcome the mistakes made in their work, to overcome the arrogance and complacency of those who consider themselves meritorious, to overcome bureaucracy and commandism, and to improve the relationship between the Party and the people." This rectification movement will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the country's construction work.
　　Within the system of people’s power, in order to implement Article 18 of the Common Program, namely "All state organs of the People’s Republic of China must practice a clean, simple, and revolutionary work style of serving the people, severely punish corruption, prohibit waste, and oppose the bureaucratic work style of alienating themselves from the people," it is very necessary to establish and strengthen the systematic work of people’s supervision. The establishment of a systematic people’s supervision work in the People’s Government should be closely coordinated with the rectification movement currently being carried out by the Chinese Communist Party, and the people's supervision work should be further improved in the rectification movement to achieve the common goal of improving various tasks.
　　The People’s Supervision Committee of the State Council has done a lot of work and achieved considerable results in the six months since its establishment. In its work summary report, it clearly put forward the tasks of the people’s supervision work in the second half of the year, the first of which is to "cooperate with the rectification and training of cadres, organize, promote, and guide the central departments and major administrative regions and the provinces and municipalities directly under the Central Government to concentrate their efforts and fight against bureaucracy, commandism, corruption, waste, sabotage of production, and all illegal and dereliction of duty and other bad phenomena." This is entirely correct. Nevertheless, the history of the people’s supervision work is still very short, and it is still a new task. Therefore, its nature and role have not yet been universally known to the people and working cadres. Some people mistakenly believe that the people’s supervision organs are only organs that specialize in "picking faults," "finding fault," and "punishing staff members," and do not understand its significant positive role. According to Article 19 of the Common Program of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference: "People’s supervision organs shall be established in the people’s governments at and above the county and municipal levels to supervise whether the state organs at all levels and various public officials are performing their duties and to correct illegal or derelict organs and personnel among them." That is to say, the objects of the people’s supervision work are state organs (including enterprise departments) at all levels and various public officials. Its task is to supervise and correct. The so-called supervision is to use methods such as checking work and developing criticism and self-criticism to enable our state organs and public officials to faithfully implement the government’s policies and laws, faithfully perform their duties, and wholeheartedly serve the people. The so-called correction means that when our state organs and public officials have shortcomings or errors or are found to be illegal or derelict of their duties, the people's supervision organs will investigate their responsibilities in a fact-based manner and give them the necessary disciplinary sanctions based on the severity of the case. Of course, conducting prior supervision is always more important than subsequent correction. The work summary report of the People's Supervision Committee correctly pointed out that in the past six months, under the difficult conditions of newly established organs, insufficient cadres, and incomplete organizational structure, supervision work was generally limited to after the occurrence of accidents, and it had not been able to conduct inspections in peacetime to prevent problems before they occurred. Therefore, the People’s Supervision Committee proposed that in the future, regular inspections and accident inspections should be well combined. This is an important key. It is almost impossible to imagine that no shortcomings or errors will occur in the work, but we cannot therefore adopt an attitude of reconciliation and tolerance towards shortcomings and errors, or simply adopt the method of post-event punishment. We must implement daily education and inspection to enable cadres and staff at all levels to make as few mistakes as possible in their work. Therefore, the work of the People’s Supervision Committees at all levels should follow the instructions of the People’s Supervision Committee of the State Council, strengthen peacetime inspections, adopt the policy of treating illnesses and saving people, and pay attention to preventing problems before they occur. Naturally, we cannot conclude from this that post-event inspection and handling are unnecessary. The correct approach is to combine peacetime inspection with accident inspection, that is, to combine supervision and correction. The purposes of both are the same, both are for "discovering problems, solving problems, exchanging experiences, correcting shortcomings, commending achievements, educating cadres, and improving work."
　　At present, when bureaucracy and commandism have become the main dangers in our country’s construction work, we should make full use of the power of the people’s supervision organs to conduct extensive supervision and correction to overcome these main dangerous tendencies.
　　Lenin said the following about the Soviet Union’s "Workers' and Peasants' Inspection" in 1921 when the Soviet Union implemented the New Economic Policy:
　　"We must be good at exercising our power through the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection. At present, this situation is not only not seen in the countryside, but also in the cities, and even in the provincial cities! Even in those places where they shout the loudest against bureaucracy, they often do not use this power. More attention should be paid to this situation."
　　Our current situation is very similar to the situation Lenin was talking about. Many people also shout against bureaucracy, but how many of them understand how to use the power of the people’s supervision organs to overcome the tendency of bureaucracy?
　　Therefore, we should rapidly strengthen and improve the people’s supervision work. On the one hand, the people’s governments at all levels should attach importance to this work and rapidly establish and improve the people’s supervision organs so that they can carry out their tasks. On the other hand, when the people’s supervision committees at all levels are carrying out their work, they should maintain close contact with the broad masses of the people so that the broad masses of the people can supervise the work of government organs and public officials anytime and anywhere. Whether it is daily work inspection or accident inspection, it should rely on both the administrative organs and the people. The system of establishing supervision correspondents stipulated by the Central People’s Supervision Committee is a good way to absorb active elements from the masses to jointly participate in supervision work. On the one hand, they can reflect the situation and raise questions through them, and at the same time, they can seriously accept and handle the cases they report. Experience has proven that any work, as long as it seriously relies on the broad masses and follows the mass line, will gain infinite power and will definitely be able to do the work well. The corruption case of the water tower project of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and the loss case of the 129 warehouse in Shijiazhuang were both discovered and handled by the leading organs after the masses complained. In the future, we should further give play to the supervisory role of the masses, combine the investigation and research of the supervisory organs with the reports of the masses, and enhance the masses' confidence in the government's supervision.
　　In order to give play to the supervisory role of the masses, criticism and self-criticism in newspapers have special significance. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the decision to launch criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals, the criticism from the people that the newspapers have received, published, and resolved has greatly increased. The people's supervision organs at all levels should make full use of newspapers, send people to the newspaper offices to directly participate in answering and resolving the questions raised by the people to the newspapers, and list such work as an important task of the people's supervision organs at all levels.
　　At present, strengthening and improving the people’s supervision work in the rectification movement has special convenient conditions. Only by establishing a systematic people’s supervision work in the people’s governments at all levels can the work of our government organs and enterprise departments be brought onto the right track more quickly. Clear distinction between merit and demerit, appropriate rewards and punishments, will make the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of all public officials more enhanced.

### 在整风运动中加强与健全人民监察工作

　　在整风运动中加强与健全人民监察工作
    我们中华人民共和国的各级政府机关及其工作人员，在中央人民政府和毛主席领导之下，一年来，接管了广大的新区，建立人民政权，镇压土匪特务，安定社会秩序，支援战争，恢复生产，统一财政，稳定金融和物价，战胜水旱灾荒，努力从事于国家的各项建设工作，获得了许多重大的成绩。这些成绩是主要的和基本的。但在另一方面，我们也应该看到：伴随着伟大成绩而来的，还有各项工作中的缺点和错误。在我们的许多政权机关和企业部门中，还有着不同程度的脱离群众的官僚主义、命令主义倾向以及某些工作人员的贪污浪费、违法失职等现象。中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会半年工作的总结报告，说明了从去年至今年五月，据不完全的统计，中央各机关及各大行政区共发生不应有的大小事件六千一百余件。这些事件发生的原因，虽然很复杂，但正如报告中所说的，其中有不少是“由于一部分领导者骄傲自满，麻痹大意，特别是他们的官僚主义与命令主义所造成”。“这种官僚主义与命令主义，不仅使国家与人民的财产遭受重大损失；且使人民政府与广大人民的密切联系受到阻碍。而且这种官僚主义与命令主义给予土匪特务分子与违法乱纪分子以可乘之机。”
    针对着目前存在的这些现象，中国共产党在全国范围内，在党的各级组织中，现正逐步展开着以检查与总结工作为主的整风运动，来实现中共三中全会的指示，即“提高干部和一般党员的思想水平和政治水平，克服工作中所犯的错误，克服以功臣自居的骄傲自满情绪，克服官僚主义和命令主义，改善党与人民的关系。”这个整风运动，对于国家建设工作，无疑地将有重大的贡献。
    在人民政权系统中，为了实现共同纲领第十八条的规定，即“中华人民共和国的一切国家机关，必须厉行廉洁的、朴素的、为人民服务的革命工作作风，严惩贪污，禁止浪费，反对脱离人民群众的官僚主义作风。”建立与加强系统的人民监察工作是非常必要的。在人民政府中建立系统的人民监察工作，这件事情和中国共产党在目前所进行的整风运动，应该紧密地配合起来，并且应该在整风运动中，更加健全人民监察工作，以达到改进各项工作的共同目的。
    政务院人民监察委员会在成立以来的半年间，已经作了不少工作，取得了不小的成绩。在它的工作总结报告中，明确地提出了下半年人民监察工作的任务，首先就是“配合整训干部，组织、推动并指导中央各部门及各大行政区与中央直属省市政府，集中力量，与官僚主义、命令主义以及贪污浪费破坏生产和一切违法失职等坏现象作斗争”。这是完全正确的。虽然如此，人民监察工作的历史究竟还很短，还是一件新的工作，因而它的性质和作用，还未能为人民群众和工作干部所普遍知晓。有的人错误地认为：人民监察机关只是专门“挑错”、“找岔子”、“惩办工作人员”的机关，而不了解它的重大的积极的作用。根据人民政协共同纲领第十九条的规定：“在县市以上的各级人民政府内，设人民监察机关，以监督各级国家机关和各种公务人员是否履行其职责，并纠举其中之违法失职的机关和人员。”这就是说，人民监察工作的对象，是各级国家机关（包括企业部门）和各种公务人员。其任务是监督与纠举。所谓监督，就是运用检查工作，展开批评与自我批评等方法，使我们的国家机关和公务人员能够忠实地执行政府的政策法令，忠实地履行自己的职责，全心全意为人民服务。所谓纠举，就是当着我们的国家机关和公务人员发生缺点或错误以及违法失职的时候，人民监察机关，将实事求是地查究其责任，并依据案情的轻重，给以必要的纪律处分。当然，经常进行事先的监督，比事后的纠举是更加重要的。人民监察委员会的工作总结报告，曾经正确地指出：在过去的半年间，他们在机关新设、干部不足、组织机构尚未健全的困难条件下，监察工作还是一般地限于事故发生之后，还没有能够在平时进行检查，防患于未然。因此，人民监察委员会提出今后应使经常检查与事故检查很好地结合。这是一个重要的关键。要设想在工作中完全不发生缺点和错误，那几乎是不可能的，然而我们却不能因此对于缺点和错误采取调和与容忍的态度，或单纯地采取事后惩办的方法。我们要施行日常的教育和检查，使各级干部和工作人员在工作中尽可能地不犯错误或少犯错误。因此，各级人民监察委员会的工作，都应该遵照政务院人民监察委员会的指示，加强平时的检查，以治病救人的方针，注意防患于未然。自然，我们并不能由此得出结论，认为可以不必要事后的检查和处理。正确的作法，是平时检查与事故检查互相结合，也就是监督与纠举互相结合。两者的目的是相同的，都是为了“发现问题，解决问题，交流经验，纠正缺点，表扬成绩，教育干部，改进工作。”
    目前，当着官僚主义和命令主义成为我们国家建设工作中的主要危险的时候，我们更应该充分运用人民监察机关的权力，进行广泛的监督与纠举，以克服这些主要的危险倾向。
    列宁在一九二一年苏联实行新经济政策的时候，曾就苏联当时的“工农检查院”说过下面的一段话：
    “要善于经过工农检查院去实行自己的权力。在目前，这种情形不但在乡村中看不到，就是在城市中，甚至在省城中也是看不到的！甚至就是在那些最高声喊着反对官僚主义的地方，他们往往也不会去运用这种权力。对于这种情况，应当多多加以注意。”
    我们目前的情况，和列宁所说的情形也很相似。有许多人也高喊了反对官僚主义，但是他们何尝都懂得运用人民监察机关的权力，去克服官僚主义的倾向呢？
    因此，我们应该迅速加强与健全人民监察工作。在一方面各级人民政府应该重视这一工作，迅速建立与健全人民监察的机构，以便他们执行自己的任务。在另一方面，各级的人民监察委员会，在进行工作时应与广大人民群众保持密切的联系，使广大人民随时随地都能监督政府机关和公务人员的工作。无论日常的工作检查或事故的检查，都应该既依靠行政机关，又依靠人民群众。中央人民监察委员会所规定的建立监察通讯员的制度，就是吸收群众中的积极分子来共同参加监察工作的很好的办法。一方面经过他们来反映情况，提出问题，同时认真地接受与处理他们所检举的案件。经验已经证明：任何工作，凡是认真地依靠广大群众，走群众路线，就会得到无穷的力量，就一定能把工作做好。郑州铁路局水塔工程的贪污案件和石家庄一二九仓库遭受损失的案件，都是经过群众的控告，然后才被领导机关所发现和处理的。今后应该更加发挥群众的监督作用，使监察机关的调查研究和群众的检举相结合，提高群众对政府监督的信心。
    为了发挥群众的监督作用，报纸上的批评和自我批评有特殊的意义。自从中共中央发布在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定以后，报纸所收到、所刊载、所解决的人民群众的批评，是极大地增长了。各级人民监察机关都应当充分利用报纸，派人到报社中去直接参加答复和解决人民群众向报社提出的疑问，并且把这样的工作列为各级人民监察机关的重要任务。
    在目前整风运动中，加强与健全人民监察工作有着特殊便利的条件。也只有在各级人民政府中建立了系统的人民监察工作，才能使我们的政府机关和企业部门的工作更迅速地走上正轨。功过分明，赏罚得宜，将使一切公务人员的工作责任心和积极性更加提高。
