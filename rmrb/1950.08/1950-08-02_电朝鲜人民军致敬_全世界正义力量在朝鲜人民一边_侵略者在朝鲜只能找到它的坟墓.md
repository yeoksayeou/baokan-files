　　A Salute to the Korean People's Army
    The World's Forces of Justice Stand with the Korean People
    Aggressors Can Only Find Their Graves in Korea
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] The Beijing All-Circles Celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day and Demonstration Against U.S. Aggression in Taiwan and Korea, sends a Salute Telegram to All Officers and Soldiers of the Korean People's Army:
    To General Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, and All Officers and Soldiers of the People's Army:
    With unparalleled bravery, you have inflicted severe blows on the American aggressors and their running dog, the Li Seung-man puppet clique, annihilated the puppet army and the army of the American aggressors in a short period, liberated vast territories, and continued your victorious advance. Every victory of yours excites us and inspires the liberation struggles of all oppressed nations in Asia. On this day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Army Day, we, on behalf of the people of all circles in Beijing, extend our highest respect and brotherly greetings to you, and extend our warm congratulations on the brilliant achievements you have made.
    The common experience of the Chinese and Korean people has proven that U.S. imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger and can be defeated. Although you will encounter difficulties on your victorious journey, justice belongs to the Korean people, and the forces of justice throughout the world stand on the side of the Korean people. The sacred cause of Korean national independence and unification will surely be victorious; all the American aggressors can find in Korea is their grave!
    Long live the Korean People's Army!
    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live General Kim Il-sung, leader of the Korean people!
    Long live the close unity and eternal friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples!
            Beijing All-Circles Celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day
        and Demonstration Against U.S. Aggression in Taiwan and Korea
