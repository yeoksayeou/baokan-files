　　Qingdao Railway Sub-bureau Achieves Gains in Anti-Bureaucracy and Red Tape

　　The Qingdao Railway Sub-bureau of the Jinan Railway Bureau launched a campaign against bureaucracy and red tape, achieving initial gains. The period from June 5th to July 15th was for studying documents. Through study, every employee recognized the harm of bureaucracy to their work, and they began to expose bureaucratic practices within their units. Heads of units also conducted self-criticism with the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, combining bottom-up and top-down criticism to bring the anti-red tape and anti-bureaucracy movement to a climax. At the same time, a rationalization proposal campaign was launched, and various units convened employee representative meetings or established management committees to further improve democratic management. New working systems and methods are also being established. According to the new spirit, the number of daily dispatches from the bureau has been reduced from an average of over twenty to eight to ten. Leaders at all levels have also begun to go deeper into the field to inspect and supervise work. Departments, sections, and field sites have generally established regular meeting systems to inspect, arrange work, and solve problems. However, the sub-bureau's anti-red tape and anti-bureaucracy movement still needs to be deepened, and democratic management needs to be strengthened.

　　Jingxing Representatives' Conference Reviews Deviations in Summer Grain Collection Work

　　In the Jingxing wheat collection work, the failure to accurately count the acreage of wheat fields and the failure to fully promote democracy seriously affected the collection work. For example, in Dawangmiao in the Second District, there were only 136 mu of wheat, but the county calculated it as 196 mu. In another example, the yield per mu of paddy fields in Yanfeng Village in the Third District was 76 jin, while the paddy fields in Duanzhuang Village, which is connected to the village and had similar quality, were assessed at 94.5 jin. These deviations were strictly criticized at the county's first People's Representative Conference, enabling the 239 village cadres attending the conference to further clarify the policies and ensure the successful completion of wheat collection.

　　Ninghe Corrects Shortcomings in Summer Grain Collection

　　In Ninghe's summer grain collection, some cadres and Party members did not follow policies, and their work methods were simplistic. The cadres of Yangzhuang Village in the First District explained the summer grain collection policy in just four minutes, resulting in unclear explanations. When assessing the acreage of fields in the Second District, all villages were uniformly increased by three-tenths, which penalized those who accurately reported their acreage and encouraged the masses to deliberately file false reports. Yuehuizhuang in the Second District had 695 mu of wheat fields, but it was assessed at 1045 mu, and disagreements arose between the county and district governments. To address this, the county government convened an emergency meeting on July 9th to correct these issues.

The project cost a total of 64 million Northeast currency, also saving 636 million Northeast currency compared to the original contracted project plan.

　　Private Iron Factories in Baoding Steal Materials and Reduce Labor in the Manufacture of Waterwheels

　　In the entrusted processing and manufacture of waterwheels, some private iron factories in the Baoding Special District of Hebei Province did not fulfill their contracts, stealing materials and reducing labor, causing losses to state property. For example, Jing Shunxing Waterwheel Factory not only failed to deliver on time but also privately stole and sold the manufactured waterwheels, and the delivered waterwheels had incomplete parts. Similarly, Tonghexing Factory caused the state to lose over 2,000 jin of millet due to stealing materials and reducing labor. The occurrence of these incidents is due to the fact that the cadres of the Water Conservancy Promotion Society were unfamiliar with the business and failed to conduct regular in-depth inspections. The Society has legally dealt with the factories that violated the contracts and reviewed and improved its own work.

    井陉各界代表会议检讨夏征工作偏向
    井陉麦征工作中，因对麦田亩数未精确统计，又未充分发扬民主，使征收工作受到严重影响。如二区大王庙只有一百三十六亩麦子，而县里却按一百九十六亩计算。又如三区岩峰村水地每亩产量为七十六斤，而与该村相连的段庄村水地质量差不多，而产量却评为九十四斤半。这些偏向，在该县首届人民代表会议上进行了严格的批判，使列席大会的二百三十九个村干部进一步明确了政策，保证胜利完成麦征。

    保定私营铁工厂制造水车中偷工减料
    河北省保定专区水利推进社在委托加工制造水车当中，部分私营铁工厂不履行合同，偷工减料，使国家财产受到损失。如景顺兴水车厂，非但不按期交货，且私自盗卖所制水车，所交水车中则零件残缺不全。又如同合兴工厂，因偷工减料，即使国家受到两千余斤小米的损失。此种事件的发生，是由于该社干部不熟悉业务，同时又未能经常深入检查所致。该社已对违反合同之各厂已依法加以处理，并检讨改进本身工作。
