　　In-depth On-site Inspection Work
    Zhengfeng Movement Fully Unfolded in Huolu County
    [From Our Newspaper] The Zhengfeng movement in Huolu County, Hebei Province, has fully unfolded. During the initial stage in July, the Huolu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party made a preliminary inspection report on the work of the entire county over the past six months, exposing several serious problems in the work. This clarified the central content and purpose of the Zhengfeng movement for all cadres in terms of ideology and policy. After the study of documents began, it was closely integrated with the inspection of work, and in-depth on-site inspections were conducted. When the Public Security Bureau inspected the case of illegally detaining Zheng Sanmao in Zheng Village (Zheng Sanmao was falsely accused of being a thief by cadres in Zheng Village. When he was sent to the Public Security Bureau, the judicial section proved that he was falsely accused by the village cadres, but because the director disagreed, he was detained for four months), in addition to general inspections, they also went deep into the masses in Zheng Village to investigate and widely solicit opinions from the masses. This made the leading cadres of the Public Security Bureau understand that their bureaucracy violated policies and separated them from the masses. When the county government inspected the bureaucracy in the well-digging work, it made a special trip to two districts for key inspections. This revealed serious coercion and false reports. The supply and marketing cooperative originally thought that all branches in the county were doing well. After this in-depth inspection, it was found that except for the Chengguan District branch, the other four district branches lost a lot of money due to unclear business policies and poor management. The Licun branch lost more than 10 million yuan. The adoption of this inspection method enabled the Zhengfeng movement in Huolu County to unfold rapidly and comprehensively. The county is now about to enter the stage of comprehensive inspection work. The county party committee has therefore instructed all agencies to continue to pay attention to studying documents during the inspection work. Before the inspection, each department must clarify the focus of the inspection work. For example, the bank should focus on inspecting the relationship between public and private sectors and the implementation of loan and financial policies. The Public Security Bureau should focus on inspecting the implementation of the lenient and suppression policies and the policy of guaranteeing human rights. And pay attention to giving opinions to the county party committee first, and then inspecting the work of the departments.

　　深入现场检查工作
    获鹿县整风运动全面展开
    【本报讯】河北获鹿县整风运动全面展开。该县在七月间开始时，先由中共获鹿县委将全县半年来的工作作初步检查报告，揭发了半年来工作中的若干严重问题。因此使全县干部从思想上从政策上明确了整风的中心内容与目的。学习文件开始后，即与检查工作密切结合。并深入现场去检查工作。公安局在检查非法扣押郑村郑三毛案件（郑三毛被郑村干部诬告为小偷，送至公安局时，经司法股审讯后，已证明为村干部诬告，但因局长不同意，就扣押了四个月）时，除作一般检查外，并深入到郑村群众中去调查，广泛征求群众意见。由此使公安局领导干部了解了由于自己的官僚主义违反了政策，脱离了群众。县政府检查打井工作中的官僚主义时，特地到两个区去作重点检查。由此发现了严重的强迫命令和假报告。供销社原来认为全县各分社都办得很好。经过这次深入检查后，除了城关区社外，其他四个区社因业务方针不明确，经营不善，赔钱很多，李村社即赔了一千多万元。由于采用了这种检查方法，使获鹿县的整风能够迅速的全面的展开。目前该县即将转入全面检查工作。县委因此指示各机关应当在检查工作中，继续注意学习文件。在检查之前，各部门必须明确检查工作的重点，如银行应当着重检查公私关系，执行贷款政策，金融政策情形。公安局应着重检查执行宽大与镇压政策和保障人权政策等情形。并且注意先给县委提意见，然后检查部门工作。    （中共获鹿县委书记侯永）
