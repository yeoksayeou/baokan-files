　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 22nd (TASS): L'Humanité published an article by French Communist Party Secretary Marty in memory of Lahaut, stating: "This shocking news has caused heartfelt grief to millions of working people. For half a century, Lahaut has been a banner in the struggle for bread and freedom, and a model in the struggle against fascism and imperialism. He was murdered, and the murderers were the Leopold gang who forced Belgium to bow down and recognize the restoration of the deposed King Leopold, and who colluded with the fascist aggressors, that is, the fascist bandits.

　　Just eight days ago, Lahaut was still in the Belgian parliament, facing the son of the king who had been a henchman of the aggressors, shouting "Long live the Republic!", fully expressing the determination of the Belgian working people to fight for peace and freedom, and against the perfidy of the ruling group that sought to restore the deposed king. This is precisely why they assassinated Lahaut. However, are only the Belgian fascists responsible for this crime? This heinous crime was planned and instigated by the imperialists; the imperialists are implementing a policy of war and armed slaughter, supporting reactionary and bloodthirsty puppets such as Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, the Leopold group, Pétain, Choltitz, and Krupp - these war fascist demons. They have resorted to banditry because they have no other way to go, because they are even more resented by the people of the world.

　　Lahaut devoted his life to the struggle for freedom and peace, and for the cause of the proletariat. He often said: "The situation is serious." He called on the working people of Belgium to be vigilant against the capitalists. He often said: "The capitalists are ruthless. They will do anything. But if we act together, we can force them to retreat." Everyone should listen to this ardent call, and everyone should understand the necessity of mass action against war preparations, against fascism, and against the rulers who serve foreign imperialists.

　　To commemorate Lahaut will further inspire us to carry out a tenacious and resolute struggle to defend peace, and to fight for bread and freedom."

    要坚决进行保卫和平的斗争
    人道报刊载马尔梯专文
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎二十二日电：人道报刊载法共书记马尔梯所著纪念拉豪特的专文称：“这一个令人惊骇的消息，使得千百万劳动人民衷心哀痛。半世纪以来，拉豪特是争取面包与自由之斗争的旗帜，是反对法西斯主义帝国主义斗争的表率。他被杀害了，杀害他的人是那些强使比利时俯首承认废王利奥波德复辟并曾与法西斯侵略者狼狈为奸的利奥波德匪帮，也就是法西斯匪帮。
    八天以前，拉豪特还在比国议会中当着曾为侵略者爪牙的国王的儿子，高呼“共和国万岁！”，充分地表达了比国劳动人民为争取和平自由、反对力求使废王复辟的统制集团的背信弃义而奋斗的决心。他们刺杀拉豪特，原因正在于此。然而，是不是只有比国法西斯分子负这一罪行的责任呢？这一件万恶的罪行，是由帝国主义者所筹备所指使的；帝国主义者实行着战争、武装屠杀的政策，支持了反动的杀人不眨眼的傀儡蒋介石、李承晚、利奥波德集团、贝当、肖尔提兹及克虏伯等人——这些战争法西斯魔王们。他们采取了匪徒的行径，是因为他们再没有别路可走了，因为他们较前更为全世界人民所忿恨了。
    拉豪特毕生致力于争取自由与和平、争取无产阶级的事业的斗争，他常说：“局势是严重的。”他号召比利时的劳动人民要警惕资本家。他时常说：“资本家是无情的。他们无恶不作。但如果我们联合行动，我们就可以迫使他们后退。”每个人应当听取这一热诚的号召，每个人应当明白以群众行动反对战争准备、反对法西斯主义与为外国帝国主义者服务的统治者的必要性。
    纪念拉豪特，将进一步激励我们进行顽强的、坚决的斗争，以保卫和平，争取面包与自由。”
