Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 13th: TASS, New York, August 12th: The Wall Street Journal published an article by Evans sharply criticizing the U.S. government's policy of forcing Western European countries to reluctantly increase armaments. Evans's article was published under the following sarcastic title: "Uncle Sam the Savior; Truman Administration Insists on Saving Western Europe with Weapons, Whether It Asks to Be Saved or Not."

Evans believes that the recent decisions by Britain and France to increase armaments were not out of their own volition but the result of constant pressure from the United States. Moreover, Western European countries only agreed to this decision after the United States made it clear that it was willing to pay the major portion of the expenses for Western European armament plans. Evans criticized the U.S. policy, saying: This meddling, troublemaking behavior is really somewhat unseemly; it is quite different from answering a desperate call for help. Evans said: The U.S. policy cannot be justified on the grounds of "security" because arming Western Europe does not strengthen the defense of the American world.

　　美强迫西欧各国增加军备
    华尔街日报发表论文尖锐抨击
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：华尔街日报发表伊文思的论文，尖锐抨击美国政府强迫西欧各国勉强地增加军备的政策。伊文思的论文是以下面的讥讽标题发表的：“救世主山姆大叔；杜鲁门政府坚持以武器拯救西欧，不管它是否要求拯救”。
    伊文思认为：英国和法国最近增加军备的决定，并非出于他们自己的意愿，而是美国经常施以压力的结果。而且，西欧国家是在美国明白表示它愿意付出西欧军备计划经费的主要部分以后才同意这种决定的。伊文思抨击美国的政策说：这种多管闲事，挑惹是非的行为，实在有些不雅观；这与答应绝望的求援是截然不同的。伊文思说：美国的政策不能以“安全”的理由来辩解，因为武装西欧并不能加强美国世界的防务。
