　　The Korean People Enthusiastically Support the Liberation War
    Large-Scale Donations of Airplanes and Tanks
    Farmers Carry Out Crash Production to Support the Front Lines
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th] Comprehensive reports from "Democratic Korea" and "Labor News": The donation campaign by the North Korean people to purchase airplanes and tanks for the People's Army is rising daily. To donate "Women's Aircraft", women in Sinuiju have donated more than 150 pieces of precious metal ornaments and more than 200,000 yuan in cash. The young men and women of Sunchon County, South Pyongan Province, decided to donate a "Youth League Aircraft" before the fifth anniversary of the August 15th Liberation. The Young Pioneers of Jinji Girls' Middle School in Gaecheon County decided to use the income from collecting waste and participating in patriotic labor as a fund to donate a "Young Pioneer Aircraft." More than 800 students in Gaecheon County also donated all of their wages from patriotic labor as a fund to purchase airplanes. People from all walks of life in North Pyongan Province, Jagang Province, South Hamgyong Province, and Hwanghae Province, out of hatred for the brutal aggressors, have donated huge amounts of money and materials to purchase airplanes and tanks to dedicate to the People's Army. Kim Ik-doo, an elderly Christian pastor in Sincheon County, Hwanghae Province, witnessing the fact that American planes blindly bombed peaceful cities and villages, and even churches and chapels were not spared, also voluntarily donated 100,000 yuan and called on all believers to work hard to help the motherland to smash the American imperialists' offensive.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 5th] According to a TASS report from Pyongyang on the 3rd: Korean farmers are actively supporting the front lines. In some places, farmers have mobilized all the labor force in the entire village and reorganized the farmers' mutual aid teams into "Front Line Teams" to carry out crash production in the spirit of fighting on the front lines. Farm women have effectively taken over the work of their husbands and sons who have joined the People's Army and have gone to the front lines. Farmers in many villages in northern Korea have prepaid the state tax in kind to support the People's Army's operations.
