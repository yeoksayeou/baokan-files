　　A Film and an Opera
　　——Eastern Europe Miscellany, Part Seven
　　Feng Zhi
　　On April 2nd, we saw the successful premiere of Hungary’s first color film, "Ludas Matyi," in Budapest. This is a story from the old Hungarian countryside. Young Ludas Matyi works as a laborer in a landlord's house. Because of a minor dispute, the landlord ties him to a bench and whips him fifty times. Subsequently, he and his mother are driven out of the manor by the landlord, leaving them homeless. However, the young man does not yield. He vows to beat the landlord three times, giving him fifty lashes each time. So, he uses various schemes and indeed finds opportunities to whip the fat landlord three times. Each time the landlord is unexpectedly whipped, he appears very distressed, eventually losing his self-confidence and developing a “shock disease,” revealing many ugly behaviors. This story fully satirizes the landlord’s foolishness and incompetence, praising the wit and intelligence displayed by an oppressed young farmer driven by a desire for revenge.

　　More than a month later, on May 8th, we saw a famous opera, "The Bartered Bride," by the Czech composer Smetana (1824-1884) at the National Theatre in Prague. This is also a rural story. There are two landlord families. The first family, Family A, has a daughter who is very beautiful. The second family, Family B, has a son who is an idiot. A matchmaker, greedy for Family B's wealth, proposes a marriage between the idiot and Family A's daughter. The parents agree, but the daughter refuses, saying she has fallen in love with a farmhand in her family and that he is her fiancé. Everyone thinks this is easy to solve. The farmhand has no money, so they can give him some money, and he will surely give up his lover. The matchmaker goes to the farmhand to discuss it. The farmhand thinks for a moment and says, "Alright, I will sell my fiancé to the eldest son of Family B." So, according to this statement, they write a contract, each keeping a copy. He sells his fiancé to the eldest son of Family B. The girl, hearing this news, cries her heart out, scolding him for being heartless. As the wedding approaches, the idiot is tricked away by a circus and cannot be found. Just as everyone is anxious, the farmhand appears. He takes out the contract from his arms and says, "Marry me." It turns out that he is the eldest son of Family B. His mother died when he was a child, and he was driven away by his stepmother. When he grew up, he worked as a laborer in some landlord's houses. Family B's parents have no choice but to watch him marry Family A's daughter amidst songs and dances. The opera ends here.

　　Our host invited us to see that film because it is the most successful production among Hungarian color films, both technically and ideologically. The colors and content are very harmonious, constantly contrasting the landlord's foolishness with the young farmer's wisdom. During the screening, our host earnestly asked me, "What do you think about showing such a film in China?" I said, "The Chinese people would definitely welcome it." As for the Czechs inviting us to see "The Bartered Bride," it is because Smetana is the people's musician of the Czechs. In the century when the Czechs were under the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, he tried his best to absorb Czech folk music and dance in his works. In this opera, people sing Czech songs and dance Czech dances. Therefore, during the performance, every time there was a song or a dance, the Czech officer sitting next to me explained, "This is the Czech national form."

　　However, beyond that, the content of the film and the opera made me think about the past lives of peasants in Europe. In Europe during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, feudal lords exploited peasants even more cruelly than before, causing peasant resistance and sparking flames of peasant uprisings everywhere. At almost the same time, some small merchants, craftsmen, and poor students often gathered in markets, taverns, and on journeys to tell folk tales. These stories mostly mocked the proud nobles and hypocritical monks, expressing protest against the ruling class through satire. Many of these stories tell of how farmers used tricks to escape the persecution of nobles or, even further, to give the nobles a powerful blow in return. They have many similarities with "Ludas Matyi" and "The Bartered Bride."

　　Regardless of how successfully these kinds of stories expressed the landlords' incompetence and the poor peasants' wisdom, until 1945, the peasants in Eastern European countries were still being suppressed by landlords to the point of suffocation. For example, Hungary, before liberation, was still a feudal agricultural country, with most of the land occupied by large landlords. The number of large landlords accounted for only two-thousandths of the rural population, while the land they occupied accounted for 43 percent of the country's farmland. One duke's family alone occupied 200,000 hectares. The land used by the Catholic Church reached 600,000 hectares. However, most of the poor peasants had no land, no houses, and their daily income was not enough to pay for a single tram ticket in Budapest. This formed what people often said verbally, "three million beggars." But the total population of Hungary was less than ten million. After Hungary's liberation, the government's first important task was land reform. 650,000 landless and poor peasant families received land, and 1.5 million hectares of land were distributed to them. Thus, the feudal landlords' and bishops' areas of control for hundreds of years were managed by the peasants themselves. Czechoslovakia, a country with stronger industrialization, did not have feudal landlords on such a large scale as Hungary, but after two land reforms in 1945 and 1948, a total of more than 400,000 poor peasant families were also divided into more than 1.3 million hectares of land. In this way, the peasants would no longer suffer the landlords' whips, and no one would use money to buy his fiancé.

　　Land reform only liberated the peasants and eradicated the exploiters. As for fundamentally changing rural society, that was done by agricultural cooperatives and agricultural machinery lending stations. These organizations were gradually established after the land reform. During the founding process, the government did a lot of difficult persuasive work, because the peasants were conservative, and once they got a piece of land, they were reluctant to let go. They were unwilling to cooperate in cultivation without distinction. We visited their agricultural cooperatives in both Hungary and Czechoslovakia. The leaders of the cooperatives always explained to us in detail: only a few families joined at the beginning, but later the number of members gradually increased. After joining, some were willing to eliminate the boundaries of the land and cultivate together, while others still cultivated their own land. Everything was up to the members' free will and not forced. However, to reward the peasants for joining the cooperatives, the government provided many assistance to the cooperatives in matters such as seed selection, fertilization, and loans. Moreover, the peasants actually benefited a lot from joining the cooperatives. They gradually went from doubt to trust, so the number of cooperatives increased year by year. Several cooperatives often surrounded an agricultural machinery lending station, and the number of tractors and tractor drivers inside also increased year by year. Each lending station has a cultural room, which has become the center for peasants to gather, entertain, and learn. In this way, new types of peasants are constantly emerging in the countryside: some tractor drivers wear labor model medals, and some young men and women have organized Michurin groups. They use their wisdom to study increasing production and improving seeds, and they no longer need to think about how to avoid the landlords' bullying or fight the landlords.

　　In the agricultural cooperatives and machinery lending stations, we deeply felt that all this would be impossible without the working class party, seeing the organization and planning shown by the peasants there. Only with the leadership of the working class party can the peasants get the land; only with the help of the working class can the countryside be mechanized and change into a new look. At the same time, I also thought that movies and operas like "Ludas Matyi" and "The Bartered Bride" can indeed give us a lot of enlightenment and make us understand the past lives of the peasants, but wouldn't it be better if we could see movies or operas containing new content that reflect the lives of the peasants after liberation?

　　Once, in the Czech Republic, after we came out of an agricultural cooperative, our host said to me: "Now there is no need to fight the landlords, but fighting the conservative ideas in the countryside is not easy either. Thanks to the efforts of the progressive youth in the countryside, a lot of roles have been played in this regard."

　　"Are there any movies or operas written about these youths now?" I asked.

　　He pondered for a moment before saying:

　　"This is a general phenomenon in the literary circles of the people's democratic countries in Eastern Europe. There are many works that write about the past oppression of peasants by landlords, the brutality of fascists, and the life in concentration camps, and mock the ruling class; but writing about new construction, new life, new people, and new things is just beginning now. In the literary department, only some poems have been produced, praising new people and new things, because poems can be completed quickly. As for novels, operas, and even movies, there are still expectations. We hope that a new group of writers can emerge from this generation of young people. They will no longer look back to before 1945, but will only write from 1945 onwards."

　　一部电影和一出歌剧
    ——东欧杂记之七
　　冯至
    四月二日，我们在布达佩斯看到了匈牙利彩色电影第一部的成功出品《路达斯·马基》。这是匈牙利旧日农村里的一段故事。青年路达斯·马基在一个地主家里做苦工，因为一点小小的纷争被地主捆在板凳上打了五十鞭子，随后他和他的母亲又被地主从庄院里赶出，弄得无家可归。但是这青年并不屈服，他立下誓愿，要在短时期内打地主三次，打他五十鞭子。他于是用了种种的计谋，果然找到机会，把那肥胖的地主鞭打了三次。地主每经过一次意料不到的鞭打，便显出十分狼狈，后来完全失却他作威作福的自信心，得了“吃惊病”，露出来许多丑态。这故事充分嘲讽了地主的愚蠢无能，颂扬了一个被压迫的青年农夫在复仇心理支配下表现的机警与智慧。
    一个多月以后，五月八日，我们在布拉格国家剧院里看到捷克音乐家斯梅塔那（１８２４——１８８４）一出著名的歌剧《出卖的未婚妻》。这也是农村里的故事。有两家地主，甲家有个女儿，长得很漂亮；乙家有个儿子是白痴。一个媒人贪图乙家的钱财，给白痴和甲家的女儿说媒。父母答应了，女儿却说什么也不答应，她说她爱上了她家里的一个长工，她是那长工的未婚妻。大家一想，这很好办，长工没有钱，给他一点钱，他一定肯把他的爱人让出来。媒人找长工去商量，长工想了一想说：“好吧，我把我的未婚妻卖给乙家的长子。”于是按照这句话彼此立下字据，各存一份，他把他的未婚妻卖给乙家的长子了。女孩子听到这消息，哭得死去活来，骂他无情。快到结婚时，白痴被一个马戏团骗走了，怎么找也找不到。大家正在焦急，长工出现了，他从怀中掏出来字据，他说：“和我结婚吧。”原来他正是乙家的长子，儿时死去母亲，后来被继母赶走，长大了就在一些地主的家里做苦工。乙家的父母没有办法，只好看着他和甲家的女儿在一片歌舞中结了婚。歌剧到这里就闭幕了。
    我们的主人请我们看那部电影，因为它无论在技术上或是思想上都是匈牙利彩色电影中一部最成功的出品，色彩与内容非常谐调，处处对照着地主的愚蠢和青年农夫的智慧。在映演时我们的主人恳切地问我：“这样的电影送到中国去演，你觉得怎样？”我说：“中国人一定会很欢迎的。”至于捷克请我们看《出卖的未婚妻》，则是因为斯梅达那是捷克的人民音乐家，在前世纪捷克被奥帝国统治的时期，他就在他作品里尽量吸取了捷克的民间音乐与舞蹈，这出歌剧人们唱的是捷克的歌曲，舞的是捷克的舞蹈。所以在演唱时，每逢一曲歌、一节舞，我旁边坐着的一个捷克军官便给我解释：“这是捷克的民族形式。”
    但是除此以外，我却由于电影和歌剧的内容想到欧洲过去农民的生活。在欧洲十五六世纪，封建主对农民的剥削比从先更为残酷，引起农民反抗，到处燃烧着农民起义的火焰，几乎在同时，有些小商人，手工艺者，以及贫苦的学生们，他们常常聚集在市场上，小酒馆里，旅途中，讲述些民间故事。这些故事多半是嘲笑骄傲的贵族和虚伪的僧侣，对统治阶级用讽刺来表示抗议。里边有许多故事，都述说农夫怎样用计谋摆脱贵族的迫害，或是更进一步，反过来给贵族一个有力的打击。它们和《路达斯·马基》与《出卖的未婚妻》都有许多类似的地方。
    不管这类故事是怎样成功地表达了地主的无能与穷苦的农民的智慧，但是直到一九四五年，东欧国家的农民始终是被地主压得喘不过气来。例如匈牙利，在解放前还是一个封建性的农业国，大部分的土地都被大地主盘据着。大地主的数目只占农村居民的千分之二，而他们占领的土地却有全国农田的百分之四十三。有一个公爵，他一家就占有二十万公顷。天主教会占用的土地，达到六十万公顷。可是大多数的贫农没有土地，没有房屋，每天的收入不够在布达佩斯乘一次电车的票价。这样形成了人们在口头上常常说的“乞丐三百万”。但匈牙利全国人口的数目还不到一千万。匈牙利解放后，政府第一件的重要工作就是土地改革。有六十五万没有土地的贫穷的农家获得土地，有一百五十万公顷的土地分给他们，于是几百年来封建地主和主教们的统治区域都归农夫自己管理了。捷克斯洛伐克是一个工业化较强的国家，没有像匈牙利那样大规模的封建地主，可是经过一九四五年与一九四八年两度土改后，一共也有四十多万贫农家庭分了一百三十多万公顷的土地。这样，农民再也不会遭受地主的鞭打，更不会有人用金钱来买他的未婚妻了。
    土改只是解放了农民，铲除了剥削者，至于使农村社会基本上起了变化的是农业合作社与农业机械出借站。这些组织是随着土改后渐渐创办起来的。在创办过程中政府曾做了不少艰难的说服工作，因为农民富有保守性，分得一块土地就不肯放手，他们不愿大家不分彼此地合作耕耘。我们在匈牙利和捷克斯洛伐克都参观过他们的农业合作社。合作社里的负责人总是不厌详尽地讲给我们听：初创办时只有少数的几家加入，后来社员渐渐增加，加入后，有的愿意彼此消除土地的界限，共同耕种，有的还是各自耕种自己的土地，一切都听由社员的自愿，不加勉强。但政府为了奖励农民加入合作社，在选种，施肥，贷款这些事务上边给合作社许多帮助。并且农民加入了合作社，实际上也得到许多利益，他们渐渐由怀疑而信任，因此合作社的数目一年比一年增加。几个合作社往往围绕着一个农业机械出借站，里边的拖拉机与拖拉机驾驶者也是一年比一年增加。每个出借站都设有文化室，成为农民聚会，娱乐和学习的中心。这样，农村里才不断地产生新型的农民：有的拖拉机驾驶者佩上了劳动模范的奖章，有些青年男女组织了米邱林小组，他们运用他们的智慧去研究增加生产，改良种籽，再也用不着想怎样躲避地主的欺凌，或是向地主战斗。
    我们在农业合作社里，机械出借站里，看到那里农民所表现的组织性和计划性，便深切地感到，若没有工人阶级的政党这都是不可能的。只有工人阶级政党的领导，农民才能分得土地；只有工人阶级的帮助，农村才能机械化，改变了新的面貌。同时我又想，像《洛达斯·马基》与《出卖的未婚妻》那样的电影与歌剧固然可以给我们许多启示，并且使我们了解过去的农民生活，但是如果能看到含有新的内容，反映解放后农民生活的电影或戏曲，岂不更好呢。
    一次，在捷克我们从一个农业合作社里出来，我们的主人向我说：“现在用不着和地主作斗争了，但是和农村里的保守思想作斗争也并不容易，多亏农村里进步青年的努力，在这上边发生了不少的作用。”
    “现在有没有写这类青年的电影或戏曲呢？”我问。
    他沉吟了片刻，才说：
    “这是东欧人民民主国家里文学界一般的现象。写过去地主压迫农民的，写法西斯的残暴的，写集中营生活的，嘲笑统治阶级的，这类的作品很多；但是写新建设，新生活，新人与新事物的现在才刚刚开始。在文学部门中只产生了一些诗，歌咏新人新事，因为诗可以迅速完成。至于小说，戏曲，甚至电影，都还有所期待。我们希望，从这一代的青年里能产生一批新的作家，他们不再回顾一九四五年以前，只是从一九四五年写起。”
