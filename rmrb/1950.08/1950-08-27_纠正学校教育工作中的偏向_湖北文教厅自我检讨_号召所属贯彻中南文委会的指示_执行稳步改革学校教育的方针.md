Correcting Deviations in School Education
Hubei Department of Education Conducts Self-Criticism
Calls on Subordinates to Implement the Directives of the Central-South Cultural and Educational Committee
Implement the Policy of Steady Reform of School Education
[This Newspaper News] Changjiang Daily News: The Hubei Provincial Department of Education issued a notice on the 17th of this month to the education sections/bureaus of various prefectures, cities, and counties, reviewing and correcting the principled errors in the department's June 12th notice on strengthening land reform education. It also instructed the education sections/bureaus of various prefectures, cities, and counties to immediately conduct inspections and self-criticisms based on the directive of the Central-South Military and Political Committee's Cultural and Educational Committee on the 5th of this month (see headline news on this paper's 21st; the headline "Central-South Military and Political Committee Issues Directive" should be corrected to "Central-South Military and Political Committee's Cultural and Educational Committee Issues Directive") in conjunction with the Changjiang Daily editorial, and to correct deviations. The full text of the notice is as follows:
"The errors in this Department's June 12th notice, as pointed out by the Central-South Cultural and Educational Committee and the Changjiang Daily editorial, are mainly that it should not have stipulated that schools should "strictly examine whether teachers and staff have engaged in concealing land, seizing tenant land, privately buying and selling land, or bullying peasants in the past and present." "If such illegal activities are discovered without honest admission of errors, they must be handed over to the local government for punishment according to the law." Although the notice pointed out that "in handling such incidents, we should still adhere to the policy of winning over, uniting, educating, and transforming intellectuals, and avoid arbitrary attacks that cause panic and chaos," if implemented according to the spirit of the notice, it would inevitably lead to the liquidation and struggle against teachers and staff from landlord and rich peasant backgrounds in schools. The result would be a division of unity among teachers and staff, causing chaos in schools. Secondly, the original purpose of our land reform education, in terms of the significance of the land reform movement itself, was to enable teachers and students to understand the importance and righteousness of land reform, and to help them transform their thinking and stand firm so that we can unite the majority, isolate the minority, and turn resistance into assistance in land reform, and carry out land reform smoothly. However, the error of our notice blurred the line between ideological education and legal sanctions, inevitably moving the rural class struggle into schools, which is actually replacing systematic and complex enlightening ideological education with simple administrative coercion. In this way, it is impossible to achieve the above-mentioned goals of land reform education, which is detrimental to the implementation of land reform.

In the past, some prefectures and counties had committed "leftist" deviations in their attitude towards intellectuals and in their work of political and ideological education for teachers and students. We have repeatedly reminded and corrected them. This time, due to our mistakes, it will more or less affect and influence some prefectures and counties and some schools to take some wrong measures in arranging and carrying out land reform education. For example, Jingzhou District launched a blitz-style ideological inspection movement in some schools, launching a "counterattack against landlord and rich peasant ideology"; teachers and staff of the private Wuchang Literary Middle School studied land reform, stipulating that everyone write a confession and send people to the countryside to verify (this matter has been corrected).

Reviewing the reasons for our mistakes in the June 12th notice, the main reason is that our understanding of the purpose of land reform education is not clear enough, and our understanding of how to conduct political and ideological education in schools is still somewhat vague. At the same time, it shows that we still lack a deep understanding and accurate grasp of the Central Committee and the Central-South Cultural and Educational Committee's instructions on the policy of uniting and transforming intellectuals. Therefore, we have been impatient in the work of transforming intellectuals and adopted crude and administrative methods.

The continuous occurrence of peasant accusations against teachers in schools across the country has made us feel the seriousness of the problem and we panicked considerably, so we hurriedly issued the June 12th notice. We did not conduct thorough research and careful consideration of this issue, which shows our rashness and careless work style.

The education sections/bureaus of various prefectures, cities, and counties should attach importance to the directives of the Central-South Cultural and Educational Committee, attach importance to the errors pointed out by the Central-South Cultural and Educational Committee, and, according to the directives, carefully inspect the past work, especially the arrangements and implementation of land reform education and school political and ideological education, and conduct reviews and make summaries in connection with leading ideology and work style. At the same time, according to the instructions of the Central-South Cultural and Educational Committee, we must firmly grasp the policy of winning over and uniting intellectuals and steadily advancing educational reform, and study and arrange the future work of school education reform—especially school political and ideological education and land reform education.

Land reform education should continue in all schools next semester and be regarded as the central content of political and ideological education. Education administrative organs at all levels should attach importance to this work and strengthen its leadership. However, the three principles instructed by the Central-South Cultural and Educational Committee must be strictly followed, and systematic reasoning and enlightening guidance should be carried out seriously. Rural class struggle methods must not be used in schools; learning about land reform and the participation of some teachers and students in land reform work must not hinder regular class studies. It should be emphasized that the purpose of carrying out land reform education is to transform the thinking of teachers, staff, and students, and is an extremely important ideological education work that is combined with the current political task of social reform in rural Hubei. This point should not be vague or wavering. We emphasize mastering systematic reasoning and enlightening guidance in carrying out land reform education, mainly referring to the spirit of ideological transformation and ideological education, which is a long-term and arduous task. Its implementation methods should not be impatient or forced, and rural class struggle methods should not be adopted. However, learning about land reform must be linked to thinking and criticizing thinking. Only in this way can learners understand, accept, and support the land reform policy, and turn resistance into assistance, and only through this learning can the ideological level of teachers, staff, and students be transformed and improved. Attention should be paid to preventing another deviation, which is the dogmatic deviation of being divorced from the actual thinking of teachers, staff, and students, or being afraid of conducting ideological criticism."

　　纠正学校教育工作中的偏向
    湖北文教厅自我检讨
    号召所属贯彻中南文委会的指示
    执行稳步改革学校教育的方针
    【本报讯】长江日报消息：湖北省文教厅于本月十七日向各专署、市、县教育科、局发出通知，检讨和纠正该厅六月十二日关于加强土地改革教育的通知所犯的原则性错误，并责成各专署、市、县教育科、局应即根据中南军政委员会文教委员会本月五日的指示，（见本月二十一日本版头条消息。这条消息标题“中南军政委员会发布指示”应补正为“中南军政委员会文教委员会发布指示”。）结合长江日报社论进行检查和检讨，纠正偏向。通知全文如下：
    “本厅六月十二日通知的错误。正如中南文委会及长江日报社论所指出的，主要的是不应该规定在学校中“严格检查教职员中过去和现在有无瞒田夺佃，私卖倒算，欺压农民等行为。”“如不坦白承认错误而发现上列不法情事，就必须送交当地政府，依法惩办。”虽然在通知中指出了：“在处理此类事件时，仍应掌握对知识分子争取、团结、教育、改造的方针，不要任意打击，造成惊恐与混乱。”但是如果依照通知精神执行，实际上必然造成在学校中对地富出身的教职员进行清算斗争，结果将会分裂教职员团结，使学校陷于混乱现象。其次，我们进行土改教育，在对土改运动本身的意义来说，原是为了使教职员和学生认识土改的重要性和正义性，帮助他们改造思想，站稳立场，以便我们在土改中团结多数、孤立少数，化阻力为助力，顺利进行土改。而我们通知的错误，把思想教育与法律制裁混淆不清，势必把农村阶级斗争方式搬到学校里来进行，实际上是简单的行政强制代替系统的复杂的启发自觉的思想教育。这样，就不可能达到上述土改教育要求的目的，对实行土改是不利的。
    某些专、县过去在对待知识分子的态度上，和在对待教师学生的政治思想教育工作上，曾经犯过“左”的偏向，我们曾一再提醒和纠正过；这次，则是由于我们的错误，或多或少的又会影响和影响了某些专、县和某些学校在布置和进行土改教育中采取了一些错误的措施。如荆州区在部分学校举行突击性质的思想检查运动，开展“对地富思想的反攻”；武昌私立文学中学教职员学习土改，规定每人写一篇坦白书，并推人下乡查对（此事业已纠正）。
    检讨我们在六月十二日通知这个问题上所犯错误的原因，主要是由于我们对于土改教育的目的性认识不够明确，对于究竟怎样在学校中进行政治思想教育这个问题认识还有些模糊；同时表现我们对中央与中南文委会历次所指示的关于团结改造知识分子政策还缺乏深刻的领会与确切的掌握，因而在知识分子改造的工作上犯了急性病，采取了粗暴的、行政命令的办法。
    由于在各地学校中接二连三的发生农民检举教员事件，使我们感觉问题的严重，相当的慌了手脚，以致匆匆地颁发六月十二日的通知。我们对于这个问题没有经过周密研究和审慎的考虑，这又表现我们的轻率和粗枝大叶的作风。
    各专、市、县教育科局应该重视中南文委会的指示，重视中南文委会指出的我们的错误，根据指示，好好检查过去的工作，特别检查关于土改教育和学校政治思想教育的布置和执行情形，并联系领导思想和作风，进行检讨，作出总结。同时根据中南文委会指示，切实掌握对知识分子的争取团结，和对教育改革的稳步前进的方针，研究布置今后学校教育改革——特别是学校政治思想教育和土改教育的工作。
    土改教育下学期在各校仍应继续进行，并把它当作政治思想教育的中心内容。各级教育行政机关对此工作应该予以重视，加强其领导。但应切实遵照中南文委会指示的三项原则，认真进行系统说理与启发诱导，不得在学校里运用农村阶级斗争方式；学习土改和部分师生参加土改工作，不得妨碍正课学习。应该着重指出：进行土改教育的目的是改造教职员和学生的思想，是结合当前湖北农村社会改革这个政治任务的一项极为重要的思想教育工作，这一点不应含糊动摇。我们强调在进行土改教育中掌握系统说理与启发诱导，主要是指思想改造，思想教育的精神，乃是较长期的艰苦工作，其进行方式，不可性急强制，尤不可采取农村阶级斗争方式。但是学习土改一定要联系思想，批判思想，只有这样，才能使学习者了解接受和拥护土改政策，化阻力为助力，才能通过这一学习改造提高教职员和学生的思想水平。应该注意防止另一种偏向，就是脱离教职员和学生的思想实际，或害怕进行思想批判的教条主义的偏向。”
