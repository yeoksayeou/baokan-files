Xinhua News Agency, August 5th: The combined issue of the Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Nos. 46 and 47 (i.e., the overall 85th and 86th issues) has been published.

The editorial of the 46th issue is entitled "The Powerful Voice of the Soviet People in Defense of Peace." The editorial elaborates on the great significance of the recent declaration by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union regarding its support for the Stockholm Peace Appeal. The editorial compares the Soviet Union's peace policy with the U.S. imperialist war policy.

The editorial states: The Soviet Union is the world's largest and most powerful country, and the decisions of its highest body have a tremendous impact on the development of international events. The Soviet Union—together with hundreds of millions of heroic Chinese people and the people of the new democratic countries, the Soviet Union is consistently and resolutely fighting for peace and against the imperialist warmongers—the great and inspiring example of the Soviet Union is making all peace fighters increasingly confident of the victory of their great and noble cause. Following the example of the Soviet Union, peace advocates will further strengthen their struggle and finally achieve their lofty goals.

The 47th issue contains two editorials, one is "The Struggle Against the Tito Group—The International Task of Communist Parties," and the other is "U.S. Imperialist Aggression Against the Korean People." The former calls on communist parties in all countries to strengthen the struggle against the Tito group, pointing out that communist parties in all countries must expose any manifestation of nationalism and opportunism in a principled, vigilant, and ruthless manner, and must promptly stop any attempt by the Tito group to spread its influence outside Yugoslavia. The latter condemns the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against the Korean people, pointing out that the struggle of the people of the world for peace will surely shatter the imperialist conspiracy of aggression.

The article "The Yugoslav Army in the Hands of Anglo-American Imperialism" by Farkas, Deputy Secretary-General of the Hungarian Workers' Party, published in the 46th issue, and the article "'Athens-Belgrade' Axis Formation is a Threat to Peace" by Zachariadis, General Secretary of the Greek Communist Party, published in the 47th issue, expose the truth that the Tito group is actively acting as a tool of the Anglo-American war. Both articles prove with facts that the Tito group had already become a running dog of Anglo-American imperialism long before the Second World War.

The 46th issue prominently publishes Stalin's article "On Marxism in Linguistics." It also publishes the statement of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the situation in Japan, and an article by Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, introducing the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

The 47th issue publishes Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Korean Workers' Party’s, "The Korean People's Struggle for a Unified, Independent, and Democratic Country" and Kim Il-sung's broadcast address to the Korean people on June 26.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版第四十六、四十七期合刊介绍
    【新华社五日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第四十六、四十七期（即总第八十五、八十六期）合刊已经出版。
    第四十六期社论，题为“苏联人民保卫和平的强有力的呼声”。社论阐述了苏联最高苏维埃最近所发表的关于拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的声明的巨大意义。社论把苏联的和平政策和美帝国主义的战争政策作了对比。
    社论说：苏联是世界上最大的强国，它的最高机关的决定对于国际间的事件的发展有着巨大的影响。苏联——和千百万英雄的中国人民以及新民主国家人民在一起，正在一贯而坚决地为争取和平反对帝国主义战争贩子们而斗争的苏联——的伟大的感人的榜样，使得所有的和平斗士对他们的伟大的高尚事业的胜利信心日益增强。遵循苏联的榜样，和平拥护者将更进一步加强自己的斗争，最后达到他们的崇高目标。
    第四十七期社论有两篇，一篇是《为反对铁托集团而斗争——各国共产党的国际任务》，一篇是《美国帝国主义对朝鲜人民的侵略》。前者号召各国共产党人加强反铁托集团的斗争，指出各国共产党要有原则地、警惕地、无情地揭穿民族主义和机会主义的任何表现，要及时制止铁托集团在南斯拉夫以外散布影响的任何尝试。后者斥责了美国帝国主义对朝鲜人民发动的侵略战争，指出全世界人民争取和平的斗争，一定会使帝国主义的侵略阴谋化为泡影。
    第四十六期所载匈牙利工人党副总书记法卡斯的《英美帝国主义掌握中的南斯拉夫军队》，和第四十七期所载希腊共产党总书记查哈里亚狄斯的《“雅典——贝尔格莱德”轴心的形成是对和平的威胁》两文，揭露了铁托集团积极充当英美战争工具的真相。这两篇文章，都以事实证明，铁托集团远在第二次世界大战期间就已经变成英美帝国主义的走狗。
    第四十六期以显著地位，登载了斯大林所作《论马克思主义在语言学中的问题》一文。此外并刊载了中共中央关于日本情势的声明，和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬介绍中国新民主主义青年团的文章。
    第四十七期登载了朝鲜劳动党主席金日成的《朝鲜人民为统一、独立、民主的国家而斗争》及金日成在六月二十六日向朝鲜人民的广播词等。
