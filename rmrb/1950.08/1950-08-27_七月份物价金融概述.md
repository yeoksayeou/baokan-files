　　Overview of Price and Finance in July
    Yang Fangxun
    Prices
    The characteristics of national prices in July were: prices of major daily necessities were stable, and some commodities and imported materials fluctuated slightly. According to the chain index of 25 major commodities in major administrative regions across the country, the average increase for the entire month was 7.3%. The increase varied from ten-day period to ten-day period, with an increase of 5.3% in the first ten days and only 1.4% in the last ten days. Regionally, the Southwest region rose as high as 10.1%, the Northwest region rose 8.6%, the Northeast region rose 8.4%, and the Central South region rose 7.6%. North China rose 7%, and East China rose 6%. The increase and decrease of various commodities also varied. Grain decreased by 2.1%, cotton cloth increased by 3.4%, and fuel increased by 8.6%. The largest increase was in white sugar, which increased by 44.8%. Imported materials such as chemical raw materials, hardware equipment, and Western medicines fluctuated greatly in the first ten days of July and tended to be stable in the last ten days. Taking Tianjin as an example, it rose by 9.6% in the first ten days, 5% in the middle ten days, and only 1.7% in the last ten days.
    During this period, the issue of the exchange gap between industrial and agricultural products is noteworthy. This issue deserves our attention. According to the exchange situation of cloth and rice in the following major cities (Note: Tianjin, Beijing, and Xi'an are calculated based on millet, while Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, and Chongqing are calculated based on rice):
         January       February        March          April     May
Tianjin  178.5       145.8       183.5  201.3  223.6
         June        July
      254.3  257.0
Beijing  180.4  178.2  184.1  205.4  202.1
      223.1  237.5
Shanghai  134.0  153.0  159.8  146.5  148.4
      156.9  162.8
Hankou  220.6  265.7  254.7  228.0  238.7
      257.1  265.3
Guangzhou  208.1  146.2  129.1  126.7  159.3
      168.2  210.9
Xi'an  199.1  182.8  227.2  312.0  363.3
      —————  436.9
Chongqing  428.0  337.1  269.6  260.0  337.3
      251.0  275.9
    Note: The numbers listed in the above table are the number of catties of rice exchanged for one bolt of white cloth.
    As can be seen from the above table, the exchange gap between cloth and rice has been gradually widening since April. However, in general, the increase in industrial products and the decline in agricultural products during this period, compared with March and April, are greatly related to the country's vigorous processing and ordering, supporting industry and commerce, promoting the gradual improvement of the market, and the gradual recovery of real purchasing power, in addition to some factors of merchant speculation. As for the decline in agricultural products, in addition to continuing the steady downward trend since March, coupled with seasonal factors, such as the successive listing of wheat and coarse grains in the north and early rice in the south, and the rush sales of old grains everywhere, the increase in commodity grains on the market naturally affected the decline in grain prices.
    In order to benefit industrial and agricultural production and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, it is undoubtedly necessary to make the exchange ratio between industrial and agricultural products more reasonable. State-owned trading institutions have organized large-scale purchases of agricultural products nationwide, and bring industrial products directly to the countryside, and the main purpose is to prevent the excessive expansion of the difference between industrial and agricultural products. However, it must also be clearly recognized that it is also very unreasonable to try to restore the prices of industrial products to the situation in March and April. Because at that time, the decline of many industrial products was an abnormal phenomenon. Most industrial production was unprofitable or even losing money, resulting in the closure of factories and unemployment of workers. If it is not stopped in time, the bad consequences will not only make industrial production stagnant, but also be very unfavorable to the rural economy and farmers. Therefore, adjusting the difference between industrial and agricultural products must first take into account whether it is conducive to industrial production and its development, and at the same time pay attention to not making farmers suffer too much, which is beneficial to agricultural production. How to concretize this principle is exactly the issue that the current People's Government is paying close attention to and researching.
    Finance
    The financial situation in July, with the gradual improvement of domestic industry and commerce and changes in the international economic situation, showed the following characteristics:
    (1) The deposit, loan, and remittance businesses of public and private banks have been developed: The deposit balance of the National Bank at the end of July increased by 12.2% compared with the end of June, and the loan balance at the end of July increased by 11% compared with the end of June. The total amount of remittances in late July increased by 1.9% compared with late June. The deposit balance of private banks and houses at the end of July increased by 9.5% compared with the end of June. The loan balance at the end of July increased by 26.3% compared with the end of June, and the total amount of remittances in late July increased by 13% compared with late June.
    The increase in bank deposits, loans, and remittance businesses is mainly due to the gradual improvement of the industrial and commercial situation, which increases the amount of capital turnover. In addition, the bank's own efforts to actively develop business, such as private banks and houses vigorously absorbing deposits, and the National Bank strengthening cash management, have all played a great role in increasing deposits.
    (2) Joint operations of private banks and houses are gradually increasing: In order to overcome difficulties and actively develop business, private financial institutions continued to establish joint organizations in July. For example, the Foreign Exchange Syndicate was established in Tianjin on July 3, with the aim of organizing domestic and foreign currency forces to jointly support exports and strive for foreign exchange. In order to support the syndicate, the National Bank has entrusted the Bank of China to sign a business contact contract with it. It is stipulated that if the syndicate has insufficient foreign exchange positions, it may apply to the National Bank for re-pledge (re-mortgage) loans, transfer advances (export packing loans), and transfer out pledges (export bill advances). On July 16, five banks, namely Jincheng, Yanye, Zhongnan, Continental, and United, organized a joint venture preparatory meeting. Under the leadership of the National Bank, the meeting focused on lending to small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises. In Shanghai, in the half month from July 1st to 16th, the first, second, and third joint venture groups of private financial institutions were established. A total of 13 banks, 21 money houses, and 1 trust company participated in the above joint venture groups. The purpose is to use collective power to promote business in a planned way and support production undertakings. The above situation shows that private banks and money houses have begun to move towards a new path. If they continue to strengthen joint organizations, and under the guidance of the National Bank, constantly improve their business and better integrate with production undertakings, the private financial industry will also improve with the recovery and development of various production undertakings.
    (3) Lowering of Foreign Exchange Rates: Foreign exchange rates were lowered twice in July, from 37,000 yuan to 35,000 yuan for the US dollar. This reduction in foreign exchange rates is based on the following two situations: First, China's prices are becoming stable, and the Renminbi's prestige is increasing, ensuring a certain stability in people's lives and the steady progress of production and construction. Second, the currencies of British and American imperialist countries are constantly devaluing and prices are rising, and the Renminbi's external purchasing power is increasing. According to recent statistics, the US dollar depreciated by 8% and the British pound depreciated by 5% in May and June. After the outbreak of the Korean War, British and American prices rose even faster, and the US price index rose by 8.5% in July.
    Although the lowering of the foreign exchange rate is not very favorable to exports on the surface, in fact, stabilizing the prices of export goods in domestic and international markets through reasonable exchange rates, and the government's efforts to reduce freight and tax rates on export goods to support exports, are in line with the long-term interests of exports. As a result, the total export value of Tianjin in July increased by 48% compared with June. At the same time, the reduction of foreign exchange rates also played a certain stabilizing role in the rise of black market prices of gold and silver dollars in Shanghai, Tianjin and other places.

　　七月份物价金融概述
    杨方勋
    物价
    七月份全国物价的特点是：主要日用必需品价格平稳，部分商品及进口物资略有波动。根据全国各大行政区二十五种主要商品环比指数来看，全月平均上涨百分之七点三。每旬上升幅度不一，上旬上升百分之五点三，下旬则仅上升百分之一点四。从地区上讲，西南区上升高达百分之十点一，西北区上升百分之八点六，东北区上升百分之八点四，中南区上升百分之七点六。华北区上升百分之七，华东区上升百分之六。各种商品升降的幅度也不一，粮食下降百分之二点一，花纱布上升百分之三点四，燃料上升百分之八点六。上涨最多的是白糖，上升百分之四十四点八。进口物资如化工原料，五金器材，西药等，七月上旬波动较大，下旬已趋平稳。以天津为例，上旬上涨百分之九点六，中旬涨百分之五，下旬仅涨百分之一点七。
    这一时期的物价中，值得注意的是工业品与农业品交换差额的问题。这一问题，值得我们注意。根据以下几个大城市的布、米（按：天津、北京、西安系以小米计，上海、汉口、广州、重庆系以大米计）交换情况来看：
         一月       二月        三月          四月     五月天津  一七八·五  一四五·八  一八三·五  二○一·三  二二三·六
         六月        七月
      二五四·三  二五七·○北京  一八○·四  一七八·二  一八四·一  二○五·四  二○二·一
      二二三·一  二三七·五上海  一三四·○  一五三·○  一五九·八  一四六·五  一四八·四
      一五六·九  一六二·八汉口  二二○·六  二六五·七  二五四·七  二二八·○  二三八·七
      二五七·一  二六五·三广州  二○八·一  一四六·二  一二九·一  一二六·七  一五九·三
      一六八·二  二一○·九西安  一九九·一  一八二·八  二二七·二  三一二·○  三六三·三
      —————  四三六·九重庆  四二八·○  三三七·一  二六九·六  二六○·○  三三七·三
      二五一·○  二七五·九
    注：上表所列系一匹白布换米的数字，单位是斤。
    从上表可以看出，四月以后，布、米的交换差额是在逐渐扩大。但一般的说，这个时期工业品的上涨与农业品的下落，如果与三、四月份比较，除了由于商人投机的部分因素外，工业品的上涨，是与国家大力进行加工、订货，扶助工商业，促进市场日趋好转，真实购买力的逐渐恢复有极大关系。至于农产品的下降，除了继续三月以来平稳下降趋势外，再加上季节性的关系，如北方小麦、粗粮与南方早稻都相继上市，各地陈粮又争相出售，市场上商品粮食增多，自然影响粮价下落。
    为了有利于工农业生产，促进城乡物资交流，应使工业品与农产品的交换比率趋于合理，这是毫无疑问的，国营贸易机构，已在全国范围内组织大力收购农产品，并把工业品直接带到农村去，主要目的也就在防止工农业产品差额的过于扩大。但亦须明确认识，如果图使工业品价格回复到三、四月的情形，也是很不合理的。因当时许多工业品下跌是不正常的现象，工业生产大多无利可图，甚至亏本，形成工厂纷纷关门，工人失业，如果不及时制止，其恶果不仅使工业生产停滞不前，对农村经济与农民也是很不利的，因此，调整工农业产品的差额，首先要照顾到对工业生产及其发展是否有利，同时也要注意使农民不要太吃亏，对农业生产有利。这个原则如何具体化，正是目前人民政府密切注意研究的问题。
    金融
    七月份的金融情况，是随着国内工商业的逐步好转与国际经济情况的变化，表现为下列几个特点：
    （一）公私银行的存款、放款、汇兑业务都有开展：国家银行七月底存款余额与六月底比较，增加百分之十二点二，七月底放款余额与六月底比较，增加百分之十一。七月下旬汇兑总额与六月下旬比较增加百分之一点九。私营行庄七月底存款余额与六月底比较增加百分之九点五。七月底放款余额与六月底比较增加百分之二十六点三，七月下旬汇兑总额与六月下旬比较增加百分之十三。
    银行存款、放款、汇兑业务之增加，主要原因是由于工商业情况的逐渐好转，需要资金周转量也就增大；再就是银行本身的努力积极开展业务，如私营行庄大力吸收存款，国家银行加强现金管理工作，对存款增多都起了很大的作用。
    （二）私营行庄联合经营逐渐增多：私营金融业为了度过困难，积极开展业务，七月份继续成立联营组织。如天津七月三日成立了外汇银团，目的是组织本、外币力量，联合扶助出口，争取外汇。国家银行为了扶助该银团，已委托中国银行与之签订业务联系合同。规定该银团如外汇头寸不足时，得向国家银行申请转质押、（转抵押）放款转打（出口打包放款）包、转出押（出口押汇）等。七月十六日，又有金城、盐业、中南、大陆、联合等五家银行组织联营准备会。该会在国家银行领导下，着重贷款中小型工商业。在上海，七月一日到十六日半个月中，便成立了私营金融业第一、第二、第三三个联营集团，参加以上联营集团的银行共有十三家，钱庄二十一家，信托公司一家。目的在运用集体力量，有计划的推进业务，扶助生产事业。以上情况说明私营银钱业已开始向着新生的道上迈进，如果继续加强联营组织，并在国家银行指导下，不断改进业务，更好的与生产事业相结合，则私营金融业也将随着各种生产事业的恢复与发展而好转。
    （三）外汇牌价挂低：七月份外汇牌价降低二次，美汇由三万七千元，降至三万五千元。这次外汇牌价挂低，基于下列两种情况：第一是我国物价趋于稳定，人民币威信提高，保证了人民生活一定的稳定及生产建设的稳步进行。第二是英美帝国主义国家货币不断贬值，物价上升，人民币对外购买力提高。据最近统计，五、六两月美元贬值百分之八，英镑贬值百分之五。朝鲜战争爆发后，英美物价上涨更加迅速，七月份美国物价指数上升百分之八点五。
    外汇牌价调低后，表面上对出口虽不大有利，但事实上，通过合理汇价以稳定出口货物在国内和国际市场上的价格，以及政府着手减低出口货物的运费与税率以扶助出口，是符合于出口的长远利益的。因之，天津七月份出口总值，反较六月份增加百分之四十八。同时，外汇牌价降低后，对上海、天津等地黄金、银元黑市价格的上升，也起了一定的稳定作用。
