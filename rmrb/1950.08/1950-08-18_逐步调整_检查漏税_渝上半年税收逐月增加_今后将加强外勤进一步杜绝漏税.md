　　Gradually Adjust, Inspect Tax Evasion
	Chongqing's Tax Revenue Increases Monthly in the First Half of the Year
	Outdoor Efforts Will Be Strengthened to Further Eliminate Tax Evasion
	[Our Newspaper Chongqing News] Chongqing's tax revenue work in the first half of the year, after continuous rectification, has gradually reduced tax evasion, and monthly income has increased.
	Chongqing was liberated relatively late, and there were not many cadres. The foundation of the work was weak. Therefore, although the income from various taxes in the first half of the year reached more than 140.1 billion yuan, and it increased every month, such as the income of more than 62 billion yuan in June, which was seven times higher than that in January (7.9 billion yuan in January), it only completed 23.52 percent of the annual task, which is equivalent to 73.16 percent of the expected completion in the first half of the year. Among them, the industrial and commercial tax completed the most.
	The reasons for the increase in monthly income are mainly that in the past six months, the tax laws formulated by the Central Taxation Bureau have been followed, and adjustments have been gradually made in accordance with the specific situation of Chongqing, and the focus has been on checking tax evasion in order to achieve fair and reasonable burden. Since January, three organizations, namely, the working team, the stamp tax inspection team, and the accounting inspection team, have been established successively to conduct frequent investigations, education, and publicity, and inspection stations have been set up on main roads. This plays a significant role in reducing tax evasion and ensuring income. For example, stamp tax revenue in June increased by eleven times compared with January, industrial and commercial tax revenue in June increased by sixteen times compared with January, commodity tax revenue also increased by 1.9 times even in the off-season, and other tax revenues increased by nine times. The main reason for the large increase in industrial and commercial tax revenue is that since January, several investigations have been conducted on industrial and commercial households, increasing the number of taxpayers from the original more than 9,000 to more than 17,000. During the democratic appraisal of the 1949 income tax and this year's first quarter business tax from May 12 to mid-June, even 29,000 households were appraised, thus increasing the industrial and commercial tax revenue (including temporary commercial tax) in June by sixteen times compared with January. The temporary commercial tax was extremely chaotic and the income was meager. Since January, due to the strengthening of inspections and the control of trading markets and warehouses, the situation has improved significantly. Commodity tax mainly strengthened resident factory taxation, controlled production and sales, and conducted a general inventory of stocks, eliminating the past chaos in the market.
	Regarding tax evasion investigation, a total of 237 cases of violations have been dealt with in the past six months. In dealing with the cases, education was the main focus, and punishment was secondary. This encouraged activists to assist the tax bureau in investigating and cracking many cases.
	In order to further eliminate tax evasion and increase national treasury revenue, the city's tax bureau decided in June to transfer all business to the branch bureaus and strengthen outdoor work. It is estimated that future work will have further development. (Zhu Changji)

### 逐步调整  检查漏税  渝上半年税收逐月增加  今后将加强外勤进一步杜绝漏税

　　逐步调整  检查漏税
    渝上半年税收逐月增加
    今后将加强外勤进一步杜绝漏税
    【本报重庆讯】重庆市上半年税收工作，经不断整顿后，漏税现象逐渐减少，逐月收入均有增加。
    重庆市解放较晚，且干部不多，工作基础较薄弱，故上半年内虽然各项税款收入达一千四百零一亿多元，且每月均有增加，如六月份收入六百二十多亿元，较一月份（一月份是七十九亿）增加七倍。但与全年任务相较则仅完成百分之二十三点五二，相当于上半年预计完成数的百分之七十三点一六。其中以工商业税完成数较多。
    各月收入增加的原因，主要是半年来依照了中央税务总局制定的税法，配合渝市具体情况，逐步进行了调整，并着重检查漏税，以求负担的公平合理。自一月份以来即先后成立了工作队、印花税检查小组、查账组等三机构，经常进行调查、教育与宣传，并在通衢要道设立检查站。这对于减少漏税、保证收入起着很大作用。如印花税收入六月份即较一月份增加十一倍，工商业税收入六月份比一月份增加十六倍，货物税收入虽逢淡月亦增加一点九倍，其他各税收入增加九倍。其中工商业税收入大量增加的原因主要是从一月份起，几次进行了工商业户的调查，使纳税户从原来的九千多户增加到一万七千余户，在五月十二日到六月中民主评议一九四九年所得税与今年首季营业税时，甚至评出了二万九千户，因而使六月份工商业税收入（包括临时商业税）较一月份增加了十六倍。临时商业税原极混乱，收入亦微，自一月份以来，由于加强了检查，控制了交易市场、仓栈后，情况有了显著的改进。货物税主要是加强驻厂稽征，控制产销，并进行了存货普查，消除了过去市场的混乱状态。
    对于漏税稽查，六个月以来，共处理违章案件二百三十七件。处理时以教育为主，处罚为辅，这样曾鼓励了积极分子协助税局缉查，并因而破案不少。
    为了进一步杜绝漏税，增加国库收入，该市税务局在六月份即决定将业务全部放到分局，加强外勤，估计今后工作将有进一步的开展。  （朱昌基）
