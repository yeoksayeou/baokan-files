　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: Bombay Dispatch: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on July 17th. The statement said: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of India recently convened a meeting and reached important resolutions on political and organizational matters.

　　The statement said: In the past two years, the Politburo has been adopting a left-leaning sectarian policy. In cities and industrial centers, it has adopted a completely left-leaning adventurist tactical line that was unsuitable for the situation at the time. In rural areas, the Politburo seriously underestimated the overall significance of the urgently needed anti-feudal land reform, and at the same time adopted a Trotskyist struggle strategy and adventurist tactics, failing to develop appropriate forms of struggle. The impact of following this line of the Politburo was the complete division of peasant unity in rural areas, leaving them helpless under brutal repression.

　　Regarding the internal situation of the party, the statement said: The organizational methods relied upon by the Politburo did not conform to the principles of Marxism-Leninism, but had a highly arbitrary and dictatorial style, showing a ruthless indifference towards cadres and the organization itself.

　　The statement then announced the new line adopted by the Central Committee after correcting the errors of the old Politburo. The statement said: The strategy determined by the current stage of the Indian liberation struggle is to strengthen the alliance between the working class and the entire peasantry, and, under the leadership of the working class, to unite all classes, parties, and groups willing to defend national independence and freedom, and oppose the brutal exploitation and oppression of India by British and American imperialists and their Indian puppets (the big bourgeoisie and feudal elements). The working class and the Communist Party should form a broad, national united front led by the working class to struggle for the realization of land reform in India, for the realization of Indian national liberation, to strive for world peace, and to oppose the imperialist conspiracy to turn India into a war base.

　　The statement, in mentioning the experience of the Chinese revolution, said: The tactics to be adopted by the Central Committee in the future will be based on the experience of the Chinese national liberation movement. The path that China has taken and that Southeast Asian countries are taking today is the only correct path before the Indian people. The Central Committee unreservedly cancels the completely erroneous, irresponsible, and defamatory criticisms made by the old Politburo against the Chinese Communist Party, and hereby passes a resolution expressing its apology to the Chinese Communist Party.

　　The statement said: The Central Committee has dissolved the old Politburo and removed Comrade Ranadive from the post of General Secretary. The Central Committee has also been reconstituted with the unanimous approval of the old Central Committee. The newly formed Central Committee unanimously elected Comrade Rajeshwar Rao as General Secretary, and the new Politburo was also formed with unanimous agreement.

　　印共组成新的中央委员会
    纠正旧政治局左倾宗派主义的错误
    以中国民族解放运动的经验为根据采取新的路线
    【新华社十三日讯】孟买讯：印度共产党中央委员会于七月十七日发表声明一件。该声明说：印度共产党中央委员会最近集会并取得了政治和组织方面的重要决议。
    声明说：在过去两年中，政治局一直采取着左倾宗派主义的政策。在城市和工业中心所采行的完全是左倾冒险主义的不能适合当时情势的战术路线。在农村中，政治局严重地低估了迫切需要的反封建的土地改革的整个意义，而同时则采取托洛茨基派的斗争战略与冒险主义的战术，没有展开适当的斗争方式。遵循政治局此种路线的影响所及，是在农村中完全分化了农民的团结，使他们在残暴的压制之下陷于一筹莫展之中。
    关于党内的状况，声明说：政治局所依靠的组织方式并不符合马列主义的原理原则，而具有高度的专横独断作风，对干部和对组织本身表示出一种无情的冷淡态度。
    声明接着宣布了中央委员会在纠正旧政治局错误以后所采取的新的路线。声明说：印度解放斗争现阶段所决定的战略，是加强工人阶级和全体农民的联盟，以及在工人阶级领导之下团结一切愿意保卫国家独立与自由、反对残暴地剥削、压迫着印度的英美帝国主义者与他们的印度傀儡（大资产阶级与封建分子）的阶级、政党和团体。工人阶级和共产党应当为此而组成一个广泛的、全国性的、以工人阶级为领导的统一战线，为实现印度的土地改革而斗争，为实现印度民族解放，争取世界和平，反对帝国主义把印度变为战争基地的阴谋而斗争。
    声明在提到中国革命的经验时说：中央委员会决定的今后所将采取的战术，将以中国民族解放运动的经验为根据。中国的所走过而为东南亚国家今天所采取的道路，是摆在印度人民面前唯一正确的道路。中央委员会无保留地取消了旧政治局对中国共产党所曾作过的完全错误的、不负责任的和诽谤性的批评，并为此通过一项决议，向中国共产党表示歉意。
    声明说：中央委员会已将旧政治局解散，并撤换总书记兰那地夫同志的职务。中央委员会也在旧中央委员会一致通过之下重新组成。新组成的中央委员会一致选出拉治施瓦·劳同志为总书记，新政治局亦在一致同意下组成。
