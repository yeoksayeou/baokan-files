　　Review of the "Say and Sing" Editorial Work in the Past Six Months
　　"Say and Sing" Editorial Board
　　Our publication has completed its first volume, totaling six issues. Now, let's conduct a comprehensive review of these six issues.

　　When we initially planned to launch this publication, our intention was to use it to directly serve the broad masses. Therefore, we established two key characteristics: In terms of content, we stipulated that it should "use the perspective of the people to write about the lives of various people and new changes." In terms of form, we stipulated that it should "strive to be both spoken and sung, so that the masses can understand and are willing to listen." Now, based on these standards, let's examine what we have published – which of these are urgently needed by the masses and can be directly accepted, which are not yet fully in line with our original requirements, and even violate our purpose.

　　I. What have we accomplished?

　　In these six issues, we have published a total of thirty-three works of varying lengths (excluding the Mass Poetry Selection and Folk Song Selection). Among these, seven articles focus on the lives of workers, ten on the lives of farmers, two on the military, and fourteen on temporary themes or other topics not specific to the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, but which should also be covered in our new society. Some of these works praise the fighting spirit of the working people, some align with current political tasks, and the vast majority are in line with our original regulations. Among them, five articles are particularly worth mentioning in terms of their ideology: "Incense Burner Goes Home" in the first issue, which describes how a person who has taken a step forward immediately motivates those who are a step behind. "Visiting Beijing" in the fourth issue raises the question of what attitude both sides should take in the new urban-rural relationship. "Little Li Ben," serialized in the fifth and sixth issues, explains how the relationship between a handicraft apprentice and the manager can be considered normal. "Zhang Shuyuan Attends the Farmers' Congress" in the sixth issue dispels some rural party members' misunderstanding of the role of the Farmers' Congress. "Hu Xiaohu and Zhao Youneng" in the same issue reminds us that increased production should not only rely on labor intensity but also on inventions and creations. The common feature of these works is that they write about content that is factually needed but has not yet been written about by others. In terms of form, four articles are also worth special mention: "Incense Burner Goes Home" in the first issue, "Sending Red Clothes" in the second issue, "Visiting Beijing" in the fourth issue, and "Second Reunion of Xiao Er and Wang Xiuwa" in the fifth issue. These articles share a common feature in their form: they break through old forms while fully conforming to nationalization.

　　Ten of these works have been sung by artists in Beijing, and eight have been frequently broadcast on the Central People's Broadcasting Station, allowing them to meet the broad masses.

　　II. Where have we not done enough or made mistakes?

　　To examine the specific shortcomings in our work, we must first review our work attitude. The most noteworthy point is that there is still an unconscious sense of complacency among our colleagues. For example, someone on the editorial board said: "Our performance is not bad, we can sell 27,000 copies." This is an unacceptable sense of complacency. In fact, a mass publication that only sells tens of thousands of copies nationwide is very few and should be considered a shortcoming that needs to be overcome urgently.

　　Because of this complacency regarding our initial achievements, we have not been able to be more humble and thoroughly examine ourselves politically, which has led to us missing many things that should have been reflected and even allowing our subjective wishes to remain within the scope of submitted articles, letting them flow freely.

　　Secondly, due to the different nature of the publication, not many of the submitted articles are suitable, leaving little room for choice. As a result, we have not been able to closely integrate each article with the current real-world tasks, nor have we been able to raise the ideological and artistic qualities of each work to the level we subjectively require. Although there are objective reasons for this, our own efforts in this area have been insufficient: the general practice for running a publication is that editors should actively organize articles from various relevant parties, but we have not done this work, only waiting for articles to come on their own, so naturally we can only use whatever comes.

　　Third, in the third and fourth issues, we published a novel titled "Golden Lock." This article is ideologically unhealthy and can easily mislead readers into mistaking a beggar who cannot be helped for a representative of poor farmers, which is very harmful to readers.

　　Fourth, because the submitted articles come from different regions (the farthest being Guangdong, Lanzhou, and the Northeast), and the editorial board cannot concentrate on reviewing the articles at the same time and place, some articles have been backlogged for too long, causing anxiety among contributors and prompting them to write letters of criticism. We feel that this is bureaucracy at work and cannot be attributed solely to objective reasons. Therefore, in addition to apologizing to those who have written letters, we have decided to immediately clear the backlog of articles in the shortest possible time.

　　In addition, the editorial board has not been careful enough in fulfilling its responsibility to revise articles, so that the published works do not meet the conditions of being both spoken and sung in every article, every word, and every sentence. This is also something we should overcome in the future.

　　III. How will we work hard in the future?

　　After overcoming complacency and bureaucratic tendencies in editing, we must further improve the following key points:

　　First, we believe that the characteristic of "directly serving the broad masses" should be maintained, but in order to "serve," we must also coordinate more closely with the "tasks" to be served. For example, the current "creation of new records" and "improvement of the reward system" in industrial production, the "land reform," "urban-rural material exchange," and "promotion of new farm tools" related to agriculture, and the "opposition to American ambition to invade Taiwan and Korea" and the "movement to defend world peace" related to current affairs... all of these should be reflected in our publication, but have not yet been. In the future, we must not let these things that should be reflected flow freely – it would be great if they came in the form of submitted articles, but if not, the editorial board should actively find ways, either by writing themselves, commissioning others to write, or soliciting articles. No matter what method we use, we must fill the gaps that need to be filled. Moreover, we must have concrete things that can guide reality and truly solve problems, and not produce some superficial things that are neither painful nor itchy just to make up the numbers.

　　Second, in terms of editing, we must strictly adhere to our submission guidelines and revise the potentially usable articles to the best possible extent. (Reprinted from the seventh issue of "Say and Sing")

专栏：

　　《说说唱唱》半年来编辑工作检讨
　　《说说唱唱》编委会
    本刊已出满一卷，共六期，现在把这六期，作个总的检讨：
    我们当初计划办这个刊物的时候，意思是想用它直接来为广大的群众服务的，因此就规定了两个特点：在内容方面：规定“用人民大众的眼光来写各种人的生活和新的变化。”在形式方面：规定“力求能说能唱，说唱出去大众听得懂、愿意听。”现在就根据这个标准，来检查一下我们发表出去的东西，那一些为大众所急需而且能直接接受，那一些尚不能完全合乎我们原来的要求，甚而违背了我们的目的。
    一、我们做到了些什么？
    在这六期中我们一共发表了大小三十三篇作品（大众诗选与民歌选未计在内），其中有七篇写工人生活的，十篇写农民生活的，两篇写部队的，十四篇写临时主题或其他不属于工农兵特有生活范围，但也是我们新社会所应涉及的。这些作品，有的表扬了劳动人民奋斗的精神，有的配合了当前的政治任务，绝大多数尚合乎我们原来的规定，其中在思想上值得特别提一提的有五篇：第一期的《香炉回家》，写出前进了一步的人马上带动了落后一步的人。第四期的《游京城》，提出了在新的城乡关系下，双方应取什么态度。第五、六两期连载的《小力笨》，说明了手工业学徒和经理的关系怎样才能算正常。六期的《张树元参加农代会》，解除了一部分农村党员对农代会作用的误解。同期的《胡小虎与赵有能》，提醒了增产不应只凭劳动强度而应恁发明创造。这几篇作品的共同特点是写出了事实上需要而别人尚未写到的内容。在形式上也有四篇值得特别提出的：第一期的《香炉回家》、第二期的《送红袄》、第四期的《游京城》、第五期的《二小重逢王秀娃》。这几篇的形式有个共同的特点是突破了旧形式，同时又完全合乎民族化。
    这些作品中有十篇在北京已为艺人演唱出去，并且有八篇在中央人民广播电台上常作广播，使它和广大群众见了面。
    二、什么地方做得不够或错了？
    要检查具体的工作中的缺点，必须要先检讨我们的工作态度，首先一点最值得提出的，是我们同人中间还存在着不自觉的自满情绪。例如：编委中有人说：“咱们的成绩还不错，能销两万七千份。”这就是一种要不得的自满情绪。实际上一个群众性的刊物，在全国只销到几万份，是很少的，是应该算作极需克服的缺点的。
    因为有了对于初步成绩的自满情绪，所以不能更虚心一点，好好从政治上检查一下，以至于漏掉了好多极应反映的东西，甚至把主观的愿望停留在来稿的范围以内，让它自流下来。
    其次，因为刊物性质的不同，收到的稿子合用的不多，没有多少选择的余地，以致未能使每篇稿子都与当前的现实任务结合得很紧密，未能使每篇作品的思想性与艺术性都提到我们主观上要求的高度。这些虽说都有客观的原因，但在这方面我们自己的努力还是不够的：一般办刊物的常规是编者要主动地到各个有关方面去组织稿子，而我们则没有做到这种工作，只是坐等稿子自己来，那自然只能只来了什么用什么了。
    第三、在第三四两期上，登出了题名《金锁》的一篇小说。这篇东西在思想上不健康，容易使读者读了把一个扶也扶不起来的叫化子误认为穷苦农民的代表，对读者是非常有害的。
    第四、又因为：一来稿的地域远近不一（最远的有广东、兰州、东北等地），二来编委阅稿的时间地点不能集中，以致有些稿件积压过久，引起投稿朋友们的焦虑，来信指摘。我们觉着这是官僚主义作祟，不能光推到客观原因上，因此除负责向来信者道歉外，决定立即在最短期间清理存稿。
    此外，编委在处理稿件的时候，未能十分细心地尽到修改的责任，使刊载出去的作品，不能每篇每字每句都合乎能说能唱的条件。这也是我们今后应克服的。
    三、今后如何努力？
    克服了自满情绪与编辑上的官僚主义之后，就须进一步改进下列要点：
    第一、“直接为广大群众服务”这个特点我们认为是应该坚持下去的，不过既要“服务”，还须得与应服的“务”配合得更紧密一些。例如目前工业生产中的“新纪录的创造”、“奖励制度的改进”，有关农业的“土地改革”、“城乡物资交流”、“新农具的提倡”，有关时事的“反对美国野心侵略台湾、朝鲜”、“保卫世界和平运动”……这一切都是极应该反映而在我们的刊物上尚没有反映的。今后对这些极应该反映的东西，不能任其自流——来稿中有了极好，如果没有，编委会应该主动地想办法，或自写、或约人写、或征文、无论用什么方法，总得把应补的空子补起来。而且必须要能够指导现实真正解决问题的具体东西，不要弄些应景的不痛不痒的东西来凑数。
    第二、在编辑方面，要严格履行我们的稿约，把可能用的稿件，尽可能改到最好的程度。（转载《说说唱唱》第七期）
