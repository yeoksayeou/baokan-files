　　The Peng Guoxiang Incident in Handan, Where He Illegally Beat His Wife
　　A Letter from the Hebei Provincial People's Court Reporting the Results of the Handling
    After the "People's Garden" published an article on May 21st entitled "Peng Guoxiang Illegally Beats His Wife, and Cadres in Handan County Suppress Women's Freedom of Marriage," our court immediately instructed the Handan County government to conduct an inspection and sent people down to investigate and understand the actual situation. We are now informing you of the results of the handling:

    After our investigation and understanding, it was proven that the situation reflected in the article was entirely true. The Handan County People's Government, the court, and the cadres of the Third District adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards Peng Guoxiang's illegal acts of oppressing women and infringing on human rights, and did not seriously handle the matter, but only perfunctorily dealt with it. This shows that our cadres cannot correctly grasp policies and wage a serious struggle against lawbreakers.

    After the criticism in your newspaper, the county court and the district both conducted self-criticisms. When Guo Xiuqin went to the county court to request a divorce, President Li of the court explained the situation to her and then let her return to the district to resolve the matter, without recognizing that Peng Guoxiang's beating was a serious infringement of human rights. This shows that his mass viewpoint is not strong, his grasp of policies is insufficient, and he did not support Guo Xiuqin's legitimate demands in handling the matter. When adjudicating Guo Xiuqin's property division, because Peng was unwilling, he only perfunctorily calculated the property as equivalent to 500 catties of rice. This is a manifestation of ignoring women's interests and the feudal remnants of valuing men and belittling women. The district government, after hearing that Guo Xiuqin was beaten by Peng Guoxiang, did not report to the county or ask about it, showing insufficient understanding of the policy of protecting human rights. They adopted an irresponsible attitude in their work and displayed some bureaucratic tendencies of "officials not intervening unless the people complain."

    Based on our investigation and the self-criticisms of the county and district cadres, we have made the following disposition of this matter:

    (1) In addition to Peng Guoxiang and Guo Xiuqin already being divorced by the Handan County Court, which will not be handled separately, Peng Guoxiang's illegal crimes are sentenced to six months of imprisonment according to law, and Guo Xiuqin is given a share of the property she should receive (equivalent to 500 catties of rice). His brother, Peng Fuxiang, who helped his brother illegally beat Guo Xiuqin and blocked the door to prevent the masses from pulling them apart, is severely criticized.

    (2) Wei Zhaoxin, the district head of the Third District, after the village cadres reported that Guo Xiuqin was beaten, did not investigate and deal with it in accordance with the policy of protecting human rights and the Marriage Law, and adopted an attitude of not asking or hearing about it, which was a dereliction of duty. President Li of the Handan County Court insisted on the procedure of not accepting the case without a referral from the district, failed to grasp the principles in handling the issue, and did not thoroughly pursue Peng Guoxiang's criminal responsibility, but only detained him for one day and one night; and for Guo Xiuqin, the beaten party, he did not adhere to the principle of protecting women's economic interests in terms of property division. Therefore, both he and District Head Wei are given disciplinary action with criticism.

    (3) In order to implement the new Marriage Law and the policy of protecting human rights, the special commissioner's office has notified all county, district, and village cadres in the entire special district to study this material.

### 邯郸彭国祥非法毒打妻子事件  河北省人民法院来信报告处理结果

　　邯郸彭国祥非法毒打妻子事件
    河北省人民法院来信报告处理结果
    五月二十一日人民园地发表了《彭国祥非法毒打妻子，邯郸县区干部压制妇女婚姻自由》一文后，本院马上指示邯郸县政府进行检查，同时派人下去调查了解实际情况。兹将处理结果告诉你们：
    经过我们调查了解，证明该文所反映的情况全部属实。邯郸县人民政府、法院和三区区干部对于彭国祥这种压迫妇女，侵犯人权的违法行为，采取了官僚主义的态度，没有认真的进行处理，只是敷衍了事。这说明了我们的干部不能正确地掌握政策，向违法者进行严肃的斗争。
    经过贵报批评之后，县法院及区均作了自我检讨。郭秀琴到县法院请求离婚时，该院李院长给她解释后就让她回区解决，没有认识到彭国祥打人是严重侵犯人权的行为。这说明他的群众观点不强，政策掌握不够，在处理时没有扶助郭秀琴的正当要求。判郭秀琴带财问题时，因彭不愿意，只将财产折米五百斤敷衍了事。这是漠视妇女利益，重男轻女的封建残余思想的表现。区政府方面听说郭秀琴被彭国祥毒打后，没向县里报告，也没有过问，对保障人权政策认识不够。在工作上采取不负责任的态度，有些“民不举，官不咎”的官僚主义作风。
    根据我们的调查和县区干部的检讨，我们对此事作了如下处理：
    （一）除彭国祥与郭秀琴已由邯郸县法院判决离婚不另处理外，对彭国祥的违法罪行，依法判处徒刑六个月，并予郭秀琴应分得的财产一份（折米五百斤）。对其兄彭福祥帮助其弟违法毒打郭秀琴，并堵门拦阻群众拉劝的行为，予以严格批评。
    （二）三区区长魏召信经村干部汇报郭秀琴被毒打后，没有按照保障人权政策及婚姻法调查处理，采取不问不闻的态度，有失职责。邯郸县法院李院长坚持不经区介绍即不予受理的手续，在处理问题上掌握不住原则，不深追彭国祥犯罪责任，只把他扣留一昼夜了事；而对被打者郭秀琴，他没有坚持带产照顾妇女经济利益的原则。因此连同魏区长均予批评处分。
    （三）为了贯彻新婚姻法和保障人权政策，专署已通报全专区县、区、村干部学习此材料。
        河北省人民法院邯郸分院兼院长  张光第
          副院长  杨华村
              八月十日
