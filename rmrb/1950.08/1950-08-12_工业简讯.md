    Tianjin Electricity Bureau's Safe Power Supply Movement Bears Fruit
    Since the Tianjin Electricity Bureau launched the production campaign for safe power supply, elimination of accidents, and reduction of line losses in May, responsibility accidents have dropped from nineteen in April to nine in May; by June, they were further reduced to three. Line losses decreased from the bureau's set quota of 13.7% to 13.22%, a total reduction in losses of over 300,000 kilowatt-hours.

    Fengfeng Mine Launches Rationalization Proposals to Utilize Workers' Wisdom and Increase Production
    Since launching the rationalization proposal campaign, the state-owned Fengfeng Mine has achieved preliminary results. For example, Liang Xianxing, Wang Youdao, and others from the repair shop改造 (gaizao - reformed, reconstructed, technically improved) the circular lathe for manufacturing screws, increasing the quota from 70 to 135 per work day. Zhang Baoquan and two others from the power plant successfully改造 (gaizao - reformed, reconstructed, technically improved) the condensate pump, ensuring regular and timely power supply. Han Zhicai, a newly promoted worker-cadre from the No. 2 Mine, 改造 (gaizao - reformed, reconstructed, technically improved) the coal mining method (i.e., the parallel double-layer coal mining method above and below), increasing the output per work day from 3.2 tons to 5 tons.

    峰峰矿开展合理化建议发挥工人智慧提高生产
    国营峰峰矿自展开合理化建议运动以来，已做出初步成绩。如修理厂梁先兴、王友道等改造了制造螺丝的圆车，使一个工作日的定额由七十个提高到一百三十五个。电厂张保全等三人改造复水泵成功，保证了经常按时送电。二矿新提升的工人干部韩之才改造回采煤法（即楼上楼下并行之双层采煤法），使每工日产量由三点二吨提高到五吨。
