Visit to Comrade Shiino Etsuro, Chairman of the New Leadership Department of the Japanese Communist Party
    By Zheng Longsan, Reporter for Tokyo Overseas Chinese News

    At 11:00 AM on June 23rd, I visited the headquarters of the Japanese Communist Party in Yoyogi again.... At the same time, the US military leadership, which had arrived in Japan a few days earlier, and Mr. Earles from the US State Department, who had arrived in Tokyo two days ago, were surrounding MacArthur, opening a map of Asia, and conducting top-secret talks.

    The Japanese people are desperately defending peace, preventing war, and striving for Japan's independence in a fierce, bloody struggle—I prepared to inquire about their lofty aspirations.

    I was led to the reception room where I had previously spoken with Tokuda Kyuichi, Secretary-General of the Japanese Communist Party.

    Every room was as vibrant as before, and the rotary printing press in the printing plant next door, printing the *Akahata* newspaper, the weapon of struggle, was still running non-stop, second by second.

    It was in this atmosphere that I faced this new leader of the Japanese Communist Party and conducted our interview:

    Reporter: On June 12th, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in its statement "On the Situation in Japan," condemned the atrocities of Japanese fascists and expressed unlimited support for the Japanese Communist Party, which is engaged in a life-and-death struggle against fascism; and the people of all China have also expressed powerful support one after another. What are your thoughts on this?

    Shiino: The Japanese Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party, under the common goal of struggling against Japanese imperialism, have jointly carried out very arduous struggles. This fact has established an unshakable foundation of "Sino-Japanese friendship" between the Chinese and Japanese people today. This time, after the Central Committee of our Party was suppressed by internal and external reactionary forces, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people immediately stood up to oppose these reactionary forces, and at the same time, they placed great expectations on our Party and the Japanese people to counterattack the fascists. We felt very grateful when we received this report.

    At present, struggling against the international imperialist forces that are causing Japanese imperialism to revive is still one of the common goals of the Chinese and Japanese people. We dare to swear to the Chinese people that the Japanese Communist Party will never succumb to any difficulties and will certainly fight to the end for our common goal.

    Reporter: On the 19th of this month, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese People's Government, appointed General Zhou Shidi as the head of the delegation to Japan and the Chinese representative to the Committee on Japan. This news has caused a great impact in all circles in Japan and around the world, especially since this appointment was announced during the so-called "Tokyo Conference"! It has even more significance!

    Shiino: We infinitely welcome the news that the Chinese People's Government has appointed General Zhou Shidi as the representative of the Committee on Japan and the head of the delegation to Japan. We believe that the Committee on Japan should take this as an opportunity to act to implement the Potsdam Declaration and the various resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission.

    It is regrettable that the recent developments of the Committee on Japan, despite the efforts of the Soviet representative, are encouraging and promoting Japanese imperialists. The Japanese people expect representatives of the Chinese People's Government to participate in the Committee on Japan and all other international organizations, and have made continuous efforts to this end. This time, the People's Government has officially appointed General Zhou as a representative to participate in international organizations related to the Japanese problem, which fully meets our hopes and goals.

    Reporter: Why are the international reactionary forces and their puppet Japanese government so frantically suppressing the Japanese Communist Party?

    Shiino: Regarding this suppression of the Central Committee of our Party and the nature of the suppressors, I said in the general report to the National Congress of the Party convened on the 18th of this month: "Obviously, this suppression cannot be said to represent the strengthening of international reactionary forces!" First, they have suffered a crushing defeat in front of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong. This crushing defeat is continuing in Vietnam, the Philippines, Burma, Indonesia—all over Asia. They can no longer hide this failure, nor can they find a solution. They are provoking new wars as a way out after being driven into this dead end. The suppression of our Party is a preparation for provoking war. However, this adventurism is bound to fail.

    This is a fact taught by world history, especially the Chinese people have taught us with their victorious practice.

    We are now moving towards the goal reached by the Chinese people. This is a road full of hope for us, a road that gives us strong confidence.

    Reporter: Where is the enemy's greatest weakness?

    Shiino: The reason why we can have absolute confidence in victory is that the purpose of the war provocateurs is only possessed by a few rulers, while on the contrary, our purpose is completely in line with the hopes and interests of the very broad masses of the people. The first task currently facing the Japanese Communist Party is to connect the people's hopes and interests of "opposing war and striving for national independence" with the democratic national front. The Japanese people hope that all nations can achieve independence and peace. Therefore, these nations are our friends. The weakness of the reactionary government lies in the fact that their friends are very few.

    Reporter: How should we expand and strengthen these factors that are most powerful for us in the future and lead them to victory?

    Shiino: The formation of this broad united front has unprecedented possibilities of success. Because before World War II, the anti-fascist united front did not have this broad slogan of national independence. However, the united front currently being organized has its vast scope of national independence. This fact is the key to leading to victory. Therefore: In order to place this struggle under the guidance of the working class, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and the working class over the allies.

    At present, the weakness of the Party is that the Party and the working class have not fully understood this political task, so there is a tendency of sectarianism. If we can successfully overcome this tendency, we believe that the political situation in Japan will undergo a great change in the coming year.

　　日共新指导部主席椎野悦郎同志访问记
    东京华侨民报记者  郑龙三
    六月二十三日上午十一时，记者又去代代木访问日本共产党总部……。在和这同一个时间，几天以前来到日本的美军首脑部和两天前才抵达东京的美国国务院意尔斯等正围着麦克阿瑟，打开一张亚洲地图，进行着万不能泄露的秘密谈话。
    日本人民正在激烈的血泊斗争中拚命保卫和平，防止战争和争取日本的独立，——我准备从他们叩询出他们崇高的愿望。
    记者被领到曾经和日共总书记德田球一对谈过的会客室。
    每一间房间都和从前一样，充溢着蓬勃的朝气，隔壁印刷《斗争武器的赤旗报》印刷场的卷筒印刷机仍然分秒不停地在旋转着。
    记者就是在这种气氛中，面对着这位日共的新指导者，进行了我们的问答：
    记者：六月十二日中共中央委员会在其“关于日本形势”的声明中指责了日本法西斯的暴行，给正在和法西斯展开决死斗争的日共表示了无限的支援；又全中国的人民也接二连三地表示了有力量的支援，你对这些有何感想？
    椎野：日本共产党和中国共产党曾在与日本帝国主义斗争的这个共同目标之下，共同进行了非常艰苦的斗争。这种事实已给中国人民和日本人民之间建立了今天不可动摇的“中日友好”基础。这次我党的中央委员会遭受内外反动势力的弹压后，中国共产党和中国人民便立刻起来反对这种反动势力，同时并对我党和日本人民给法西斯们的反击寄予莫大的期待，我们接获这个报道时，感到了非常感激。
    在目前，对正在使日本帝国主义死灰复燃的国际帝国主义力量进行斗争，仍然是中日两国人民的共同目标之一。我们敢向中国人民宣誓，日本共产党绝对不屈服于任何困难，必定为共同的目标斗争到底。
    记者：本月十九日，中国人民政府周恩来外交部长任命周士第将军为驻日代表团团长和对日委员会中国代表。这个消息已在日本各界和全世界引起了很大的影响，尤其这个任命正发表在所谓“东京会议”的开会期中！更有莫大的意义！
    椎野：我们无限地欢迎中国人民政府任命周士第将军为对日委员会代表和驻日代表团团长的这个消息，我们认为：对日委员会应该以此为契机，为实践波茨坦宣言和远东委员会的各种决议而活动起来。
    很遗憾的是：对日委员会最近的动态，虽然有着苏联代表的努力，然却在鼓励助长日本帝国主义者。日本人民期待着中国人民政府的代表参加对日委员会和其他一切国际机关，而且亦为此作了不断的努力。这次人民政府正式任命周将军为参加有关日本问题的国际机关的代表，完全符合了我们的希望与目的。
    记者：国际反动势力和它的御用机关的日本政府，为何如此疯狂地弹压日本共产党？
    椎野：关于这次对我党中央委员会的弹压和弹压者的本质，我在本月十八日召开的党全国代表大会的一般报告中曾这样说过：“很明显，这个弹压，并不能表示是国际反动势力的加强！”第一，他们已在毛泽东主席领导下的中国人民面前遭到了惨败。这种惨败在越南、菲律宾、缅甸、印尼等地——整个亚洲亦正在继续着。他们已无法隐瞒这种失败，同时也不能得到解决。他们正在挑拨新的战争，作为被赶进这种死巷后的逃生之路，对我党的弹压就是挑拨战争的一种准备。然而这种冒险主义终必遭失败。
    这是世界历史所教示的事实，尤其是中国人民已用了他们胜利的实践教示了我们。
    我们现在正向着中国人民所达到的目标前进。这是一条对我们充满着希望的道路，是给了我们一个坚强自信心的道路。
    记者：敌人的最大弱点在哪里？
    椎野：我们能对胜利抱着绝对信心的原因是：战争挑拨者的目的是仅为少数支配者所具有，而相反地，我们的目的却完全符合非常广大的人民大众的希望和利益。目前日本共产党所面临的第一个任务是：把人民“反对战争，争取民族独立”的希望与利益和民主民族战线连结在一起。日本人民希望所有的民族都能得到独立及和平。因此这些民族都是我们的朋友。反动政府的弱点正是在于他们的朋友是非常少数的。
    记者：今后应该如何把这些对我们最有力量的因素扩大、加强，并导向胜利？
    椎野：结成这种广泛的统一战线已有了空前的成功的可能性。因为在第二次世界大战以前，反法西斯的统一战线并没有这种民族独立的广泛口号，然而，目前正在组织中的统一战线却有其民族独立的广大的范围。这种事实就是导向胜利的关键。因此：为了把这种斗争置于工人阶级指导之下，必须加强党和工人阶级对于同盟军的领导。
    目前，党的弱点是：党和工人阶级还未充分了解这种政治任务，因此存在着一种宗派主义的倾向。如果我们能成功地克服这种倾向，我们相信，今后一年间，日本的政治形势将起一个很大的变化。      （康大川译）
