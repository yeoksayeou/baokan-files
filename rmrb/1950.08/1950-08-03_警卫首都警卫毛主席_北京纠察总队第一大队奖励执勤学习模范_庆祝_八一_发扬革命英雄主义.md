　　Guarding the Capital, Guarding Chairman Mao
    Beijing Disciplinary Corps First Battalion Rewards Model Duty and Study
    Celebrating "August 1st" and Promoting Revolutionary Heroism
    [Reported by this newspaper] To celebrate the "August 1st" Army Day and promote the new revolutionary heroism in the troops, the First Battalion of the Beijing Disciplinary Corps held a model award conference on July 27th and 28th at the auditorium of the Second Municipal Middle School, rewarding more than 220 models in duty, production, and study in the past six months.
    In the past six months, the battalion has achieved great results in performing its garrison disciplinary tasks. Cooperating with the Beijing Public Security Bureau and Public Security Forces, it has consolidated the revolutionary order of the capital, protected the safety of central organs and leaders, and protected the safety of the lives and property of the people of Beijing and the smooth progress of production and construction. In the six months of duty, a large number of models and activists have emerged. They have indeed played a leading, backbone, and bridging role, and in close contact with the masses, they have sincerely helped and led the masses forward, and humbly learned from the masses. Therefore, they have been supported and loved by the masses and were selected as models.
    Typical reports were given at the conference. The vivid deeds of the models deeply moved the representatives present. Their creations and experiences also taught everyone a lot. For example, Wu Jinke, a squad leader of the First Company, is the head of a mutual aid group. He led the entire group to formulate a work plan and proposed three fasts, three goods, and three thoroughness in duty to challenge another mutual aid group. The three fasts are: 1. Fast discovery, processing, requesting instructions, and reporting; 2. Fast liaison and mutual support for martial law signals; 3. Fast research and registration after returning to the team. The three goods are: 1. Good military appearance and demeanor; 2. Good speaking and attitude; 3. Appropriate handling of problems and good political impact. The three thoroughness are: 1. Thorough implementation of the plan; 2. Thorough and conscientious work; 3. Do things to the end. Because he put forward these specific slogans in a timely manner and led the entire group to implement them conscientiously, it greatly promoted the work of the entire class. These slogans were discovered by the leadership and promoted throughout the team. Liu Erliang, a member of the Second Company, can maintain policies and adhere to principles in his duties. When Sun Shangwen, the deputy political instructor of their company, quarreled with a businessman over buying things, he immediately stepped forward to mediate. After persuading Sun to leave, he explained and apologized to the businessman, which deeply moved the surrounding citizens, who said, "The disciplinary team is really reasonable." Other models also have their own characteristics, strengths, or weaknesses, but these comrades have a common characteristic, as the chairman of the conference said in his closing remarks, that is: infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause and honestly serving the people. In addition to loyalty and honesty, the models have all paid attention to learning, and have all paid attention to learning culture and business. Most of the models in duty are also learning models, and now most of them can read general books and newspapers and write letters home.
    In warm applause and slogans, the battalion commander personally presented glorious prizes to the model comrades.
    The conference read out the congratulatory letter from the battalion party committee to the models and all the representatives, and after passing the letter of condolences to the Korean People's Army, it closed with high-pitched shouts of "Use our practical actions—defend the capital—support the front-line troops to liberate Taiwan quickly!" "Resolutely eliminate special agents and bandits, and consolidate the revolutionary order!" "Oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Korea!" "Salute the Korean military and civilians!"

　　警卫首都警卫毛主席
    北京纠察总队第一大队奖励执勤学习模范
    庆祝“八一”发扬革命英雄主义
    【本报讯】为庆祝“八一”建军节，发扬部队里革命的新英雄主义，北京纠察总队第一大队于七月二十七、八两日假市立二中大礼堂召开奖模大会，奖励半年来在执勤、生产、学习中的二百二十多名模范。
    半年来，该大队在执行卫戍纠察任务上有很大成绩。协同北京公安机关、公安部队，巩固了首都革命秩序，保卫了中央机关和首长们的安全，保卫了北京市人民生命财产的安全和生产建设的顺利进行。在半年执勤中，涌现出了大批模范、积极分子。他们确实起到了带头、骨干和桥梁作用，并在与群众密切联系中，诚恳地帮助和带领群众前进，虚心地向群众学习。因而，他们都为群众所拥护、爱戴而被评选为模范。
    大会曾进行典型报告。模范们的生动事迹，使到会代表深受感动。他们的创造和经验，也使大家学习了不少东西。如一中队队员武进科是互助组小组长，他带领全组订出工作计划，并提出执勤中三快、三好、三彻底来和另一互助组挑战。三快是：一、发现问题，处理请示报告快；二、戒严信号连络互相支援快；三、归队后研究登记快。三好是：一、军容严肃姿态好；二、说话和气态度好；三、处理问题恰当政治影响好。三彻底是：一、实现计划要彻底；二、工作认真要彻底；三、有始有终做到底。由于他适时地提出这些具体口号，并带动全组认真执行，对全班工作起了很大的推动作用。这些口号为领导上发现后，推广到全队。二中队队员刘二良在执勤中能维护政策，坚持原则。他们中队副政治指导员孙尚文为买东西和一商人吵起嘴来，他发现后马上过去排解，待说服孙走后，并向商人解释、道歉，使周围市民深受感动，都说：“纠察队真说理。”其他模范也各有自己的特色、长处或缺点，但这些同志有着一个共同的特点，正像大会主席在闭幕词里所说，就是：对革命事业无限忠诚，老老实实为人民服务。模范们除了忠诚老实之外，他们都注意了学习，都注意了学习文化和业务。执勤中的模范大多数也是学习模范，现在一般的都能看一般书报和写家信。
    在热烈的掌声和口号声中，大队长亲自将光荣的奖品发给模范同志。
    大会宣读了大队党委会给模范和全体代表的贺信，以及通过了给朝鲜人民军的慰问信后，在高呼“用我们实际行动——保卫首都——支援前方部队迅速解放台湾！”“坚决肃清特务土匪，巩固革命秩序！”“反对美帝侵略朝鲜！”“向朝鲜军民致敬！”等口号声中闭会。
