　　Democratic Management of the Kaifeng Repair Shop
    Wang Zhimin
    By July of last year, the Kaifeng Repair Shop of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau had been liberated for six months, but most workers still held the muddled idea of "earning money to eat" and had a very weak relationship with the trade union. They also didn't report problems to the trade union. The staff members were even more obsequious, just dealing with things superficially. According to an analysis of the factory's employee situation at the time, out of more than five hundred employees, only fifteen were activists, and the vast majority were in the middle. At that time, the trade union's work was not active, and even after the Management Committee was established, it did not function. Administratively, the factory was managed solely by orders. As a result, everything encountered difficulties, and some cadres lost confidence in their work.
  “The factory is everyone's factory, everyone manages it.”
    In August 1949, Comrade Wang Jieshan was transferred from the Northeast to serve as the deputy director of the factory. The workers had already spread the word: "A Northeast cadre is coming to be the factory director!" They were very worried about questions like: "What kind of factory director is he?" "Does he understand technology?" On his first day at the factory, Comrade Wang Jieshan emphasized in his speech to the workers: "The factory belongs to all of us, and everyone manages this factory," leaving a very deep impression on the workers. The next day, this unfamiliar factory director went through the factory. He ran into a fitter in the iron workshop who had just clamped a piece of red-hot iron from the furnace. The factory director grabbed a sledgehammer and started working with a bang. This action immediately spread throughout the factory: "This factory director understands technology! Our skills won't be buried; let's all work hard!"
    Managing a factory well is not a simple matter, nor is it something that one person can accomplish. It requires raising the awareness of the vast majority of employees, fully utilizing the wisdom of the workers, and relying on sound organizations and excellent cadres for leadership. However, the repair shop lacked all of these conditions. Waiting was impossible, so it was necessary to create favorable conditions and break through the difficulties. Based on his experience working in the Northeast, Deputy Director Wang deeply realized that "the trade union is a powerful assistant to the administration" and "the Management Committee is the best organizational form for mobilizing workers to manage the factory." With these clear beliefs, the work of training cadres, strengthening the trade union, and strengthening the Management Committee began.
  The trade union is a powerful assistant to the administration
    The trade union was originally idle and had nothing to do. After Deputy Director Wang came, he introduced the Northeast experiences of "the trade union facing production" and "everyone running the trade union." With the strong support and assistance of the administration, the trade union's activities became more substantial, the trade union groups gradually improved, and cadres began to grow. The trade union established prestige among the employees. By the end of December last year, out of the factory's eighteen groups, six group leaders were able to grasp the overall situation and formulate work plans for the group; seven group leaders were able to complete their tasks; and the remaining five group leaders were also able to lead by example and work hard. Among the factory's ninety-three trade union cadres, thirty-nine were able to play a promoting role and had appeal, and thirty were able to complete their tasks. These excellent cadres, gradually cultivated through practical work, became the basic leadership force of the trade union in production. The trade union group became the core leadership in the production group; the production cadre supervised production and organized labor; the organizational cadre understood everyone's ideological situation; the assessment cadre checked technical standards and achievements; and the communications cadre collected model deeds on the spot and provided them to the propaganda cadre for commendation. The trade union became active in the factory.
  The Management Committee is the best organizational form for mobilizing workers to manage the factory
    With a foundation in trade union work, the content of the Management Committee also became richer. If workers had any opinions, they were quickly reflected to the Management Committee through the trade union group. If something could be done, it was done, and the workers felt good. If it couldn't be done, the trade union representatives would explain and answer, and the workers also felt good. Because of the cadres' amiable style, the workers' opinions and requests were valued, and the workers gradually realized that they were in the position of masters, so they naturally said whatever they wanted and were very concerned about the factory's affairs. For example, worker Shi Shou Xuan was originally an ironworker during the Kuomintang reactionary rule, but was demoted to miscellaneous work because he didn't know how to curry favor. After the worker representatives raised this matter, the Management Committee discussed and changed him back to his original position. This correct decision not only made worker Shi Shou Xuan feel very happy and work more actively than anyone else, but also had a great impact on other workers. The lighting in the machine room, power generation room, and fitter's workshop was too dim, which hindered work. The workers requested that glass windows be installed, and the Management Committee immediately approved it and the administration approved it to be carried out. A certain section chief of the factory added three workers privately without going through the Management Committee. The workers disagreed and requested the Management Committee to handle it. The Management Committee accepted everyone's opinion and handled it accordingly. The workers said: "This is really our workers running the house." The Management Committee established prestige among the masses.
    Each month's production plan was first drafted by the Management Committee, then issued by the trade union to each trade union group for discussion, and then the opinions were collected and submitted to the Management Committee for revision and implementation. Once, the Management Committee set the plan for manufacturing switch machines at forty per day. After discussion by the iron workshop trade union group, it was revised to sixty, and the task was completed as planned. Because all major matters were discussed through the workers and through the Management Committee with worker representatives participating, the workers increased their sense of responsibility. The workers said: "We must not only plan production, but also plan materials and time, and plan how to improve quality and reduce costs." The repair shop's Management Committee thus had rich content and truly assumed the responsibility of managing the factory.
  The factory's situation is completely new
    Six months passed, and by January 1950, the situation in the repair shop had been completely renewed. Although the production tasks for 1950 were very heavy, after the Staff and Workers' Representative Conference and the Management Committee researched and discussed them, and then the groups formulated guarantee plans to complete the tasks, the workers' morale was high and their confidence was full. With three months as a production period, a production competition was launched. The workers' enthusiasm for production was overflowing everywhere, the phenomenon of slack work in the past disappeared, and the employees' ideological understanding was improved. The number of activists in the factory increased from fifteen to sixty-four; and only a very small number of laggards remained. Under the efforts of all the employees to improve technology and increase production efficiency, the entire year's production plan for 1950 was completed in advance within half a year. In these six months, they also put forward sixty-three rationalization proposals, which powerfully promoted the factory's production.

　　开封修配厂的民主管理
    王志敏
    到去年七月，郑州铁路局开封修配厂已经解放了半年，但大多数工人还存在着“挣钱吃饭”的糊涂思想，和工会的关系很淡漠，有事也不向工会反映。职员们更是点头哈腰，支应对付。据当时全厂职工情况分析，五百多职工中，积极分子仅十五人，中间分子为数极大。当时，工会工作活动不开，管委会建立起来了也不起作用，行政上单靠命令来管理工厂。因此什么事情都遇到困难，部分干部对工作失掉了信心。
  “工厂是大伙的工厂，大家来管理。”
    一九四九年八月间，从东北调来王介山同志任该厂副厂长。工人们早就传开了：“有个东北干部来当厂长了！”他们很耽心这样的问题：“这个厂长怎样呢？”“他懂不懂技术呢？”王介山同志到厂第一天，和工友讲话就强调指出：“工厂是我们大家伙的，大家来管理这个工厂”，给工友们留下了极深的印象。第二天，这个生疏的厂长在厂里串了一遍，碰到铁工房有个掌钳的刚从炉子里钳出一块烧红了的铁来，厂长抢了把大锤，砰砰磅磅地抡起来就干。这一干不要紧，全厂马上传开了：“这个厂长懂得技术！我们的本领埋没不了，大家好好干吧！”
    把工厂管理好，不是一件简单的事情，也绝不是一个人能够办到的事情。它需要提高广大员工的觉悟，充分发挥工人的智慧，依靠健全的组织和优秀的干部进行领导。但是这些条件在修配厂一样也不具备。等待既不可能，只有创造有利的条件，突破困难。王副厂长根据在东北工作的经验，深深体会到“工会是行政的有力助手”，“管委会是发动工人管理工厂的最好的组织形式”。在这些明确的信念下，培养干部、健全工会、健全管委会的工作就开始了。
  工会是行政的有力助手
    工会原来闲着没事做。王副厂长来了以后，就把东北“工会面向生产”和“大家办工会”等经验介绍出来。在行政大力支持和帮助下，工会活动充实起来了，工会小组也逐渐健全起来，干部开始成长了。工会在员工中树立起了威信。到去年十二月底，全厂十八个小组，其中有六个小组长能掌握全面，能订小组工作计划；有七个小组长能完成任务；其余五个小组长也能以身作则，努力工作。全厂九十三个工会干事中，有三十九个干事能起推动作用，有号召力。有三十个干事能完成任务。从实际工作中逐渐培养起来的这些优秀干部，就成了工会在生产中的基层领导力量。工会小组成为生产小组中的核心领导；生产干事督促生产，组织劳力；组织干事了解每人的思想情况；考核干事，检查技术标准和成绩；通讯干事在现场收集模范事迹，供给宣传干事进行表扬。工会在厂里活跃起来了。
  管委会是发动工人管理工厂的最好的组织形式
    工会工作有了基础，管委会的内容也就跟着充实起来了。工人有什么意见，很快地通过工会小组反映到管委会里，该办的就办了，工人们就觉得痛快。不能办的，就由工会代表进行解释、答复，工人也很痛快。由于干部作风的和蔼可亲，工人提出的意见和要求都被重视，工人逐渐地体会到处在主人翁的地位，便很自然地有啥说啥，非常关心工厂里的事情。例如工友史寿轩，在国民党反动统治时期原是铁工帮匠，后因不会奉迎，被降为杂工。这事经工人代表提出后，经管委会讨论将他改回原职。这一正确的决定，不仅使史寿轩工友从此心情非常愉快，干活比谁都积极，而且给予其他工友的影响非常大。机器房、发电房、钳工房的光线太暗，妨碍工作。工友们要求按上玻璃窗，管委会马上通过，并经行政批准照办。该厂某股长没有通过管委会私自添了三个工人，工友们不同意，要求管委会处理。管委会接受了大家的意见照办了。工友们说：“这真是咱们工人当家了。”管委会在群众中间树立了威信。
    每月的生产计划，都由管委会首先提出一个草案，经工会发给各工会小组讨论，然后把意见收集起来，交管委会修正执行。有一次，管委会定出造转辙器的计划为每天四十个。经铁工部工会小组讨论，修改为六十个，结果如数完成。由于一切重大的事情都通过工友讨论，通过有工人代表参加的管委会讨论，工友们增加了责任感。工友们说：“我们不但要计划生产，还得计划材料和时间，计划怎样提高质量，减低成本。”修配厂的管委会从而有了丰富的内容，真正担负起管理工厂的责任。
  工厂的情形焕然一新
    半年过去了，到了一九五○年一月，修配厂的情形已经焕然一新。一九五○年的生产任务虽然非常繁重，但由职工代表会及管委会研究讨论，再由小组里订出了完成任务的保证计划以后，职工情绪高涨，信心充足，以三个月为一个生产期，展开了生产竞赛。工人们的生产热情到处洋溢，过去怠工的现象消除了，员工们的思想认识提高了。全厂积极分子已由十五人增加到六十四人；落后分子也只剩下极少数的几个人了。全厂职工在改进技术、提高生产效率的努力下，一九五○年全年的生产计划，已经提前在半年内完成了。在这半年中，他们还提出了合理化建议六十三件，有力地推进了工厂的生产。
