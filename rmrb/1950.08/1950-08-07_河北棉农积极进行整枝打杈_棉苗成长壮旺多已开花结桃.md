Hebei Cotton Farmers Actively Carry Out Pruning and Suckering
    Cotton Seedlings Grow Strong and Vigorously, Many Have Blossomed and Formed Cotton Bolls
    [This Newspaper's Report] (Combined reports from correspondents): After completing thinning and aphid control work on cotton fields, which account for a quarter of the country's total cotton planting area, cotton farmers in Hebei Province are actively carrying out cotton pruning and suckering work in conjunction with hoeing and applying additional fertilizer.

    Last year, many counties in the province suffered from rampant cotton growth due to a lack of pruning techniques, resulting in a general yield of only 40 to 50 jin of seed cotton per mu. Some counties that seriously carried out cotton pruning harvested 30 to 50 jin more seed cotton per mu than unpruned cotton fields; some even exceeded twice the yield. Learning from last year's experiences and lessons, various localities generally began pruning and suckering work when the cotton seedlings reached about one chi (foot) in height. The three special districts of Handan, Shijiazhuang, and Dingxian have now basically completed the first round of suckering and are carrying out the second or third round of suckering, with topping already underway in many areas; pruning and suckering work is also generally underway in the special districts of Baoding, Cangxian, Xingtai, and Hengshui.

    Cotton seedlings that have undergone pruning and suckering are growing vigorously, generally reaching more than two chi in height, with each plant bearing about ten cotton bolls (i.e., cotton calyxes), and most cotton bolls have blossomed and formed cotton bolls.

    Strengthening technical guidance is an important aspect of carrying out this work during pruning. In the beginning, many cadres could only make general appeals due to a lack of technical understanding. The masses, lacking pruning habits and techniques, urgently requested technical guidance, and did not welcome such empty calls. Therefore, to do a good job in cotton pruning, technical guidance must be strengthened. The Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office held a 189-person cotton pruning technical training class in mid-May to enable cadres to master the techniques. In the Handan Special District, all counties except Shexian and Guantao also held pruning training classes, with agricultural technicians serving as instructors and leading practical exercises. Nangong County organized a 15-county and district cadre tour to Dongzhang Village, a key cotton planting village, to learn techniques; some villages accepted the cotton planting experience of veteran farmers, or the technical team conducted research to help the masses solve technical difficulties they couldn't solve regarding pruning.

    In leading cotton pruning and suckering work, various localities also paid attention to understanding and dispelling the masses' concerns about excessive burdens and labor costs. For example, Qiuxian used the example of increased yields without increased taxes from last year to publicize the burden policy of rewarding labor with increased yields without increased taxes. Guangzong used the example of pruned households last year only spending a few workdays and harvesting 130 jin of cotton per mu, while unpruned households only harvested 100 jin, to give the masses a detailed calculation, making them aware of the benefits of pruning and suckering and motivating them to actively go to the fields to carry out pruning and suckering.

    Various counties have vigorously mobilized women and semi-laborers to participate in pruning and suckering, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor. Among the 586 people pruning in Chengan Dongzhanghe, women, children, and old men accounted for more than 390 people. To encourage women to go to the fields, some farmers in Cixian even held family meetings to reward women for going to the fields to participate in pruning.

    From the submissions from various localities, it appears that some areas have not paid enough attention to pruning and suckering work, resulting in rampant growth; some areas are still limited to general appeals, without deeply mobilizing cotton farmers and helping them solve technical problems, so that pruning work cannot be carried out; these problems should be solved in a timely manner to avoid affecting the realization of this year's cotton yield increase plan.

　　河北棉农积极进行整枝打杈
    棉苗成长壮旺多已开花结桃
    【本报讯】综合通讯员报道：河北省棉农，在占全国植棉面积四分之一的棉田上，完成了间苗、除蚜工作后，又结合锄棉、施追肥，积极展开棉花整枝、打杈工作。
    该省去年不少县份因缺乏整枝技术，致棉棵长疯，一般每亩只收籽棉四、五十斤。有些县认真进行了棉花整枝，较不整枝的棉田多收籽棉三十到五十斤；有的甚至超过两倍。各地接受了去年的经验教训，今年在棉苗长到一尺左右时，即普遍展开了整枝、打杈工作。邯郸、石家庄、定县三个专区现已基本完成头遍打杈，并进行二遍或三遍打杈工作，不少地区已在打顶；保定、沧县、邢台、衡水等专区整枝打杈工作也正在普遍进行。
    经过整枝打杈的棉苗，成长旺盛，一般都有二尺多高，每棵已结棉苓（即棉萼）约在十个上下，多数棉苓已开花结桃。
    在整枝中，加强技术指导是开展这一工作的重要环节。开始有不少干部因不懂技术，只能做一般号召，群众因缺乏整枝习惯和技术，迫切要求技术指导，对这样空洞的号召，都不欢迎。因此，要想作好棉花整枝工作，必须加强技术指导。石家庄专署，为了使干部掌握技术，在五月中旬举办了一百八十九人的整棉技术训练班。邯郸专区除涉县、馆陶外、各县也举办了整枝训练班，由农场技术人员担任教员，并领导实习。南宫县组织了十五个县、区干部参观团，到植棉重点村东张家庄学习技术；有些村接受老农植棉经验，或由技术小组进行研究，帮助群众解决了不会整枝的技术困难。
    各地在领导棉花整枝打杈工作中，还注意了解除群众怕多负担、怕费工的思想顾虑。如邱县用去年多收不多征的实例，宣传了同样土质多收不多征的奖励劳动的负担政策。广宗采用去年整枝户只费几个工，每亩收棉一百三十斤，不整枝只收一百斤的例子，给群众算了细账，使群众认识了整枝打杈的好处，推动群众积极下地进行整枝打杈。
    各县均大力发动妇女、半劳动力参加整枝打杈，解决了劳动力不足的困难。成安东漳河整枝的五百八十六人中，妇女、儿童、老汉即有三百九十多人。为了鼓励妇女下地，磁县有些农民还召开了家庭会，奖励妇女下地参加整枝。
    从各地来稿看来，有些地区对整枝、打杈工作还没有重视起来，以致发生长疯现象；有的地区仍然限于一般号召，没有深入发动棉农，并帮助其解决技术问题以致整枝工作开展不起来；这些问题应及时解决，以免影响到今年棉田增产计划的实现。
