　　The CPC Chahar Provincial Committee Expels Fu Hezhang from the Party
    and Suggests the Government Punish Him According to Law
    Fu Hezhang, a native of Yi County, Hebei Province, is 33 years old this year. He joined the Party in 1938 and started working in 1940. He served as the Organization Minister of the Zhangjiakou City District Committee and is currently the manager of the Wucha Xinzhing Coal Mine. His mistakes are as follows:
    Since Fu arrived at the Xinzhing Coal Mine, he has been derelict in his duties and has not taken developing the mining industry as his responsibility. Instead, he has engaged in private gain at public expense, embezzled and engaged in bribery, and colluded with private merchants to engage in speculative business. Last year, the bank provided the mine with four loans, totaling 470 million border currency, but Fu used 179.6 million yuan as private funds to do business jointly with degenerate elements Liu Xian, Lu Bingren, and profiteer Sun Jiwu under the guise of public business, trafficking in contraband – opium, and selling it among the workers. Last year, the government invested 30 million border currency in the mine (equivalent to 50 dan of rice), planning to develop the side kilns to increase production, but Fu ignored state property and focused his main energy on running his private business. As a result, the side kilns failed to be developed, and the funds invested by the government were embezzled and wasted by him.
    Secondly, Fu and Sun Jiwu, etc., frequently engaged in commercial activities among the workers, with unfair transactions. For example, a pair of sneakers, the purchase price was equivalent to 1.24 dou of rice, but the selling price was 2.6 dou; and there was coercion for workers to buy them. When workers asked for back pay, Fu replied: "You want wages? No, here are sneakers for you!" Worker Zhai Xuan was forced to flee and become unemployed because he could not afford to pay for opium. More seriously, Fu even lent the miners' rifles to Sun Jiwu to force worker Li Ji to pay his debts, stripping Li of his clothes and detaining him.
    Fu, Liu, Lu, Sun, etc., spent their days and nights together eating, drinking, and having fun, ignoring their official duties. He also set up his own small kitchen and hired a cook. His wife did not work, but she hired a nanny and a sewing and washing servant, acting like a rich "master" and a rich "madam." The mine kept a horse, nominally for public use, but in reality, it became his personal property. In order to have an improper relationship with a woman named Mei Zi, he drove away the residents who lived in the same courtyard as the woman.
    Fu Hezhang's mistakes have had a very bad impact among the workers, damaging the Party's prestige. He has lost the basic qualifications of a Communist Party member.
    In order to rectify the Party's organization and enforce Party discipline, the Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection has decided, and the CPC Provincial Committee has decided to expel Fu Hezhang from the Party and recommends that the government punish him according to law and recover the embezzled funds.

### 中共察哈尔省委开除傅贺章党籍  并建议政府依法惩办

　　中共察哈尔省委开除傅贺章党籍
    并建议政府依法惩办
    傅贺章河北省易县人，现年三十三岁，一九三八年入党，一九四○年参加工作，曾任张家口市区委组织部长，现任五岔新中煤矿经理，其所犯错误如下：
    傅自到新中煤矿后，玩忽职守，不以发展矿业为己任，反而假公济私，贪污舞弊，勾结私商大搞其投机买卖。去年银行曾给该矿贷款四次，共计边币四亿七千万元，而傅竟以一亿七千九百六十万元作为私人资金，与蜕化分子刘贤、卢秉仁、奸商孙继武等假借公家名义共同经商，贩运违禁品——鸦片，并在工人中出售。去年公家投资该矿边币三千万元（折米五十大石），计划开采傍窑增加生产，而傅竟置国家财产于不顾，以其主要精力放在经营私人买卖上。致使傍窑未能开成，公家投入的资金都被他贪污浪费了。
    其次，傅与孙继武等经常在工人中进行商业活动，买卖不公道，如球鞋一双，买价折米一斗二升四合，卖价则为二斗六升；且有强制工人购买的行为。当工人要求追付工资时，傅竟回答：“你们要工资吗？没有，给你们球鞋好了！”工人翟选因无法偿付大烟钱，被迫逃亡失业。更严重的是傅竟将矿工大枪借与孙继武向工人李吉逼债，将李衣服剥掉，并予扣押。
    傅与刘、卢、孙等日夜混在一起吃喝玩乐，置公务于不顾。他自己又设立着小伙房，雇厨夫一人。他老婆没有工作，还雇着保姆和缝洗佣人，装作阔“大爷”、阔“太太”。矿上养马一匹，名义上是公家使用的，实际上成为他个人私有。为了和一个叫梅子的女人搞不正确的男女关系，就将和该女人同院的住户撵走。
    傅贺章所犯的错误，在工人群众中造成极坏的影响，损害了党的威信，他已失掉一个共产党员的起码条件。
    为了整顿党的组织，严肃党的纪律，由省委纪律检查委员会通过，并由中共省委决定开除傅贺章党籍，并建议政府依法惩处，追回他所贪污的部分。
