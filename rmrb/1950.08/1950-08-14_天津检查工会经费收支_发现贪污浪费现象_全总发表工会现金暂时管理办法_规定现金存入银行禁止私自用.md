Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: According to the Beijing Worker's Daily, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Funds Management Committee has preliminarily inspected the revenue and expenditure of funds of subordinate trade unions at all levels, and discovered serious embezzlement and waste.

In many trade union organizations in the city, there is no dedicated person in charge. There are no strict accounting systems or reporting systems for the safekeeping and use of funds. Some trade unions do not even have account books. According to preliminary investigations, there were 83 cases of embezzlement and embezzlement of funds in disguise. Among them, the stevedores' union and the rickshaw pullers' union had 69 people (mostly branch directors and members) who embezzled more than 10 million yuan in membership dues. Tan Zhenshan, the former director of the Tangda Seamen's Union, privately used more than one million yuan in membership dues to do business. Waste of funds is also appalling. For example, the travel expenses reimbursed by the trade union cadres of Ji'an Yarn Factory and Automobile Transportation Company almost accounted for two-thirds of the total membership dues of the two trade unions. The Longchang Reed Mat Cooperative Trade Union spent more than 500,000 yuan from the labor insurance fund to send off cadres. The loss of funds is also very large. For example, the Food Trade Union lost all 1.14 million yuan in membership dues in May. In addition, there are many phenomena of chaotic expenditures due to unclear procedures.

The main reasons for the above-mentioned serious embezzlement and waste are that the ideology and work style of some trade union cadres are impure. Secondly, leading cadres of trade unions at all levels do not pay enough attention to the safekeeping of funds, and some even mistakenly believe that it is "administrative work" and let it go. At the same time, the relationship between the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Funds Management Committee and the lower-level trade unions is not close, and the management committee does not know about the embezzlement and waste events that have occurred below. In addition, the lack of a sound system for the safekeeping and use of funds also provides opportunities for embezzlers and wasters.

After discovering the above problems, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting to focus on discussing the handling and future improvement of funding work. The meeting believes that those who embezzle or embezzle funds in disguise should have the original amount recovered, and then be dealt with separately according to the severity of the circumstances. Particularly serious cases should be sent to the court for handling. Those who lose funds should be ordered to repay the full amount. In the future, in addition to continuing to investigate, members and the masses should be mobilized to supervise. In addition, a strict budget and final accounting system should be established, and all funds should be deposited in the bank and uniformly allocated by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions.

After this cleanup, the textile, hardware, and stevedoring industrial unions have initially established accounting systems. The industrial trade unions and grassroots trade union organizations have established income and expenditure reports for membership dues and cultural and educational expenses, and report to the Funds Management Committee on time. Trade unions at all levels have deposited most of their funds into the National Bank.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: In response to the urgent problems discovered by trade unions at all levels in clearing up revenue and expenditure, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions stipulates that trade unions at all levels shall temporarily handle cash management and accounting treatment according to the following provisions from September 1st: All cash of trade unions at all levels, except for the necessary expenses, must be deposited in local branches, offices or entrusted institutions of the People's Bank of China. The amount of cash kept by oneself shall generally not exceed three days of daily expenses. It is strictly forbidden to embezzle public funds privately. Each expenditure must be recorded in the account at any time, and a receipt from the payee must be obtained. Those who forge receipts privately shall be treated as embezzlement. It is not allowed to arbitrarily write off accounts, nor is it allowed to omit entries. All account books and vouchers shall not be destroyed without the approval of the higher-level trade union organization. The decision pointed out that if trade unions at all levels fail to handle matters in accordance with the regulations, their directly subordinate trade unions shall give appropriate treatment according to the severity of the circumstances. In addition to the above-mentioned temporary measures, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is drafting various trade union financial management measures to establish and improve the cash management and accounting system of trade union organizations.

　　天津检查工会经费收支
    发现贪污浪费现象
    全总发表工会现金暂时管理办法  规定现金存入银行禁止私自挪用
    【新华社十三日讯】据北京工人日报消息：天津市总工会经费管理委员会初步检查了所属各级工会的经费收支工作，发现严重的贪污和浪费现象。
    该市不少工会的组织中，没有专人负责。经费的保管和使用也没有严格的会计制度和报表制度。有的工会竟连账簿也没有。据初步调查，贪污和变相贪污经费的事件，共有八十三起。其中搬运工会和三轮车工人工会，有六十九人（多数是支会主任和委员），贪污了会费一千万元以上。塘大海员工会前主任谭振山则私将会费一百多万元去作生意。在浪费经费方面也很惊人。如济安纱厂和汽车运输公司的工会干部报销的车费，就几乎占该两工会会费总数的三分之二。隆昌席苇合作社工会，给干部送行，却在劳保基金上开支了五十多万元。遗失亏损也很大。如食品工会把五月份的会费一百一十四万元全部丢了。此外，由于手续不清而造成开支紊乱的现象也有不少。
    产生上述严重的贪污浪费现象的主要原因，是部分工会干部的思想和作风不纯，其次则是各级工会领导干部对经费保管不重视，有的竟误认为是“事务工作”，放任不管。同时市总工会经费管理委员会和下级工会的关系也不密切，下面发生了贪污浪费事件，管委会还不知道。此外，缺乏完善的经费保管和使用的制度，也使贪污浪费分子有机可乘。
    天津市总工会在发现以上问题后曾举行会议，着重讨论处理和今后改善经费工作的办法。会议认为对贪污或变相贪污经费者，应追回原款，再根据情节轻重分别处理，特别严重的送法院处理。遗失经费者则令其如数偿还。今后除必须继续清查以外，还要发动会员群众来进行监督。此外，要建立严格的预决算制度，并把经费全部存入银行，由市总工会统一拨发。
    在这次清理以后，纺织、五金、搬运等产业工会已初步建立了会计制度。各产业工会和工会基层组织，已建立了会费、文教费的收支报告表，按时向经费管理委员会作报告。各级工会并已将大部经费存入国家银行。
    【新华社十三日讯】中华全国总工会针对各级工会在清理经费收支中所发现的急需解决的问题，规定各级工会在现金管理和会计处理方面自九月一日起暂时按下列规定办理：各级工会所有现金，除留必要开支款项外，必须存入当地中国人民银行分支行、办事处或委托机构。自己保存的现金数目，其限额一般不得超过三天的日常开支。严禁私自挪用公款。每项开支，必须随时记账，并必须取得收款人之单据，私自伪造单据者以贪污论。不准任意下账，亦不得漏写账目。所有账册单据，未经上级工会组织之批准，不得销毁。决定指出：各级工会如有不按规定办理者，其直属上级工会应视情节轻重，予以适当处理。除上述暂时办法外，中华全国总工会正在拟制各项工会财务管理办法，以建立和健全工会组织的现金管理和会计制度。
