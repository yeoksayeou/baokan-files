　　Systematically Establishing the People's Judicial System

    The success of the First National Judicial Conference will put our country's people's judicial work fully on the right track.

    The people's judicial work is one of the important weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship and an important part of the people's state apparatus. It is wrong to underestimate the people's judicial work and think that it is dispensable. Article 17 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "Abolish all laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government that oppress the people, formulate laws and decrees to protect the people, and establish a people's judicial system." This not only shows that the task undertaken by the people's judicial work is very arduous, but also shows the essential difference between the people's judicial work and the anti-people's judicial work. All the laws, decrees, and judicial systems of the Kuomintang reactionary government represented the interests of the feudal landlords and comprador-bureaucratic bourgeoisie and oppressed the people; the laws, decrees, and judicial system of our People's Republic of China represent common interests of the working class, the peasantry, the petty bourgeoisie, the national bourgeoisie and other patriotic and democratic elements, based on the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance, and serve the people. Therefore, the people's judicial organs and the anti-people's judicial organs are completely different in terms of tasks, organizational systems, working methods, and styles. In the past, the anti-people's judicial organs of the Kuomintang government cruelly suppressed the revolutionary activities of all working people and their advanced elements, and protected the political and property privileges of landlords and comprador-bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Now, the task of our people's judicial organs is exactly the opposite. We must do our best to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the people and fight against the counter-revolutionary elements, the enemies of the people. Our current central task is to suppress the sabotage of counter-revolutionary forces, defend the victorious completion of land reform, safeguard national economic construction, and punish criminals who endanger the interests of the people in order to consolidate the order of the people's democratic dictatorship.

    Although our people's judicial work has a considerable history in the old liberated areas and has accumulated some experience, this work is still a relatively new and weak link in the entire country today. The people's judicial organs have done a lot of work in the past year, but at the same time, there are some problems that need to be solved urgently. The main problems are that there are still some inconsistent views among the people's judicial workers, the people's judicial institutions and systems have not been universally established and improved, the quality of the people's judicial cadres is not good enough, and the laws and decrees are not yet complete. This National Judicial Conference promoted the experience of the people's judicial work in the liberated areas, introduced the experience of Soviet judicial construction, and solved many urgent problems in terms of viewpoints and systems. This is a great achievement.

    The conference thoroughly criticized the fact that some old judicial personnel still hold strong old "Six Codes" views and have erroneous understandings such as "the Six Codes are still a usable code." The origin of this erroneous view is mainly because some old judicial personnel have not realized the class-based essential difference between the reactionary Six Codes and the current laws of our People's Republic of China. They do not yet understand that our laws are the laws of the people's democratic dictatorship, while the laws of the Kuomintang are tools for protecting the reactionary rule of landlords and comprador-bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and are shackles that suppress and bind the broad masses of the people. All views that only look at the Six Codes from a formal point of view are wrong. We should not only completely abolish the Six Codes, but also enable all people's judicial workers to clear the influence of the Six Codes from their minds and establish a new democratic legal viewpoint.

    According to reports from many places, during this period, many judicial organs and judicial personnel had deviations in implementing judicial policies. The main reason for these deviations is that some cadres did not realize that the most basic characteristic of the current laws of the People's Republic of China is that they are the laws of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and are the laws that serve this people's democratic dictatorship state. Therefore, in the implementation of criminal policy, many places have a "boundless leniency" bias in the handling of counter-revolutionary cases, and do not understand that it is necessary to exercise dictatorship over the three enemies, such as imperialists, feudal classes and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and other resolute counter-revolutionary elements. In particular, they do not have a clear policy viewpoint on handling counter-revolutionary cases. Article 7 of the Common Program has long clearly stipulated: "The People's Republic of China must suppress all counter-revolutionary activities and severely punish all Kuomintang counter-revolutionary war criminals and other incorrigible counter-revolutionary leading elements who collude with imperialism, betray the motherland, and oppose the people's democratic cause. For ordinary reactionaries, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists, after disarming them and eliminating their special forces, it is still necessary to deprive them of their political rights in accordance with the law within a necessary period, but at the same time provide them with a way out for life and force them to transform themselves into new people through labor. If they continue to carry out counter-revolutionary activities, they must be severely punished." This affirms that all counter-revolutionary criminals and the three enemies should be treated as objects of dictatorship, and this affirms that a policy combining suppression and leniency should be implemented. The "leniency" here is not "boundless", but a policy that emphasizes that "the principal culprits must be dealt with, those who were coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded," and none of these three can be neglected. As for our civil policy, it is to protect the legitimate interests of all the people, not just to protect the interests of some people while not protecting the interests of others. Therefore, the certain deviations that have occurred when some judicial personnel have not correctly protected the specific legitimate interests of the parties involved in litigation when implementing civil policies should be corrected. At the same time, we should also recognize that prisons, as one of the weapons of the people's democratic dictatorship, are tools for maintaining law and discipline and punishing criminals. The prison administration policy should combine punishment and education. It is wrong to unilaterally emphasize education; it is also wrong to only punish prisoners without educating them. In short, to correctly implement civil and criminal policies in trial work, we must act in accordance with the Common Program. Only by standing on the position of the Common Program, standing on the position of the people, and serving the greatest interests of the greatest number of people can we do a good job in the people's judicial work.

    The National Judicial Conference also criticized the phenomenon that the people's courts currently do not grasp the focus of their work and have a backlog of cases. In order to reduce and clear the backlog of cases, the mistake of illegally arresting and detaining people must be corrected; public security and procuratorial work must be strengthened; mediation work in districts and villages must be strengthened, and the organizational strength of the masses should be used as much as possible to reduce disputes. For some civil cases or some minor criminal cases that can be mediated, consideration can be given to resolving them through district and village mediation and arbitration committees, comrades' trial committees and other methods organized by trade unions, peasant associations, and other people's organizations. Cases that should not be sent to the court should not be submitted to the court. This will facilitate the people's courts to concentrate their efforts on handling counter-revolutionary cases, cases of sabotage of economic construction, and other important cases.

    In terms of the organization and system of the people's judicial organs, it is necessary not only to completely smash the anti-people's bureaucratic organs of the past Kuomintang government, but also to abolish the cumbersome, slow, and disturbing litigation procedures left behind by it. It is necessary to establish people's judicial organizations and systems that are convenient for the people, connected to the people, and conducive to attracting the broad masses to participate in activities. Our current people's courts no longer charge litigation fees, and the procedures are simple. People's courts at all levels have duty systems or inquiry offices to handle disputes for the masses in a timely manner. Moreover, in order to connect with and educate the people, there are also public trial systems, audience speaking systems, jury systems, circuit trials and on-site trials, mediation systems, legal and disciplinary education systems, and the promotion of arbitration committees and comrades' trial committees among the masses. These are all reflections of our mass line in the organization and system of the people's courts. These should be continued and promoted.

    The working style of our people's judicial organs is a realistic, selfless, honest, and dedicated revolutionary style that serves the people, so people's judicial workers must have the people's position, mass viewpoint, and realistic qualities. We must resolutely eliminate the tyrannical, arbitrary, corrupt, and murderous crimes and residual styles of the Kuomintang's anti-people's judicial organs.

    Of course, cadres determine everything. The current difficulty of insufficient quality of people's judicial work cadres should be resolved. First of all, people's governments at all levels should find ways to allocate a certain number and quality of veteran cadres to their subordinate judicial organs as the backbone, in order to improve the people's judicial organs, better grasp policies, and establish good work styles. Secondly, it is necessary to vigorously train new cadres, which is the basic direction for solving the cadre problem. In addition to the judicial departments running training classes, it is also necessary to run the law departments of existing universities well so that the law departments of various universities can adapt to the needs of the people's judicial work. The third is to transform old judicial personnel. Regarding the training and cultivation of judicial cadres, it is difficult to rely solely on the judicial organs at all levels to solve the problem themselves, and it is necessary to rely on the support and assistance of governments at all levels.

    This National Judicial Conference not only basically solved a number of major policy ideas and principles related to the people's judicial work, but also discussed the draft of our country's new Criminal Law Outline, the Interim Organizational Regulations for People's Courts, the General Rules of Litigation Procedures, the Interim Regulations on Prisoner Transformation, and the Company Law. Everyone clearly saw the essential difference between these draft laws and the reactionary Six Codes, and at the same time, provided opinions on the revision of these draft laws. Everyone saw how the Central People's Government planned and systematically drafted and formulated laws and decrees to protect the people. At the same time, the conference also exchanged views and reached a consensus on the nature, tasks, organization and working system of the People's Procuratorate, which is responsible for reporting illegal personnel and supervising law-abiding personnel, as well as the mutual relations between the People's Procuratorate and the People's Court, the People's Supervisory Authority, and the People's Public Security Organs.

    We hope that cadres of people's judicial work at all levels across the country will, in accordance with the spirit of this National Judicial Conference, conduct systematic inspections and summaries of the policy ideas, working systems, and working styles in the current people's judicial work, and use this as the content of the rectification movement of the people's judicial cadres, launch criticism and self-criticism, and improve the ideological policy level and professional ability of the people's judicial work cadres. We also hope that people's governments and people's organizations at all levels will provide all-round supervision and assistance to the construction of people's justice, and regularly and systematically carry out publicity and education on people's laws and disciplines to the people, so that our country's people's judicial work can be further strengthened, so as to quickly and systematically establish a people's judicial system and consolidate our people's democratic dictatorship state system.

　　系统地建立人民司法制度
    第一届全国司法会议的成功，将使我国人民司法工作，全面地走入正轨。
    人民的司法工作，是人民民主专政的重要武器之一，是人民的国家机器的重要部分之一。轻视人民司法工作，认为人民司法工作是可有可无的观点是错误的。中国人民政协共同纲领第十七条规定：“废除国民党反动政府一切压迫人民的法律、法令和司法制度，制定保护人民的法律、法令，建立人民司法制度。”这不但说明了人民司法工作所担负的任务非常艰巨，而且也说明了人民司法工作和反人民的司法工作在本质上的不同。国民党反动政府的一切法律、法令和司法制度，是代表封建地主和买办官僚资产阶级的利益的，是压迫人民的；我们中华人民共和国的法律、法令和司法制度则是代表以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级和民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子的共同利益的，是为人民服务的。因此，人民的司法机关和反人民的司法机关，无论在任务上、组织制度上、工作方法和作风上，都是迥然不同的。过去国民党政府反人民的司法机关，残酷地镇压一切劳动人民及其先进分子的革命活动，保护地主、买办官僚资产阶级的政治和财产特权；现在我们人民的司法机关的任务就恰恰与它相反。我们要尽力保护人民的合法权益，而向人民之敌的反革命分子斗争。我们目前的中心任务是镇压反革命势力的捣乱，保卫土地改革的胜利完成，保卫国家经济建设，惩治危害人民利益的犯罪分子，以巩固人民民主专政的秩序。
    我国人民的司法工作，在老解放区虽然有了相当的历史，积累了一部分经验，但在今天整个国家来说，这个工作仍然是较新的和较弱的一环。一年来人民司法机关已经做了不少工作，但同时有一些问题亟待解决。这些问题主要的是在人民司法工作者中有些观点还不一致，人民司法的机构和制度尚未普遍建立与健全起来，人民司法干部质量都还不够，法律、法令尚不完备。这次全国司法会议发扬了解放区人民司法工作的经验，介绍了苏联司法建设的经验，并且从观点上、制度上解决了许多迫切的问题。这是一个大的收获。
    会议对于一部分旧司法人员保存着浓厚的旧六法全书的观点，存在着“六法全书仍然不失为一部可用的法典”之类的错误认识，做了彻底的批判。这种错误观点的由来，主要的是因为一部分旧的司法人员，没有认识到反动的六法全书和我们中华人民共和国现在的法律的在阶级上的本质区别。他们还不了解我们的法律是人民民主专政的法律，而国民党的法律却是保护地主与买办官僚资产阶级反动统治的工具，是镇压与束缚广大人民群众的枷锁。一切只从形式上去看六法全书的观点都是错误的。我们不仅应该彻底废除六法全书，而且应该使一切人民司法工作者从思想上廓清六法全书的影响，建立新民主主义的法律观点。
    据许多地方的报告，这一时期，不少的司法机关和司法人员，在执行司法政策上是有偏差的。这种偏差发生的主要原因，是由于一部分干部，没有认识中华人民共和国当前法律的最基本特点，是以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的法律，是为这个人民民主专政国家服务的法律。因此，在执行刑事政策时，有不少地方对于反革命案件的处理，发生了“宽大无边”的偏向，不懂得对帝国主义者、封建阶级和官僚资产阶级等三个敌人及其他坚决反革命分子是必须实行专政的。特别是他们没有明确处理反革命案件的政策观点。共同纲领第七条早已明白规定：“中华人民共和国必须镇压一切反革命活动，严厉惩罚一切勾结帝国主义、背叛祖国、反对人民民主事业的国民党反革命战争罪犯和其他怙恶不悛的反革命首要分子。对于一般的反动分子、封建地主、官僚资本家，在解除其武装、消灭其特殊势力后，仍须依法在必要时期内剥夺他们的政治权利，但同时给以生活出路，并强迫他们在劳动中改造自己，成为新人。假如他们继续进行反革命活动，必须予以严厉的制裁。”这就是肯定要把一切反革命罪犯及三个敌人作为专政的对象，这就是肯定要实行镇压与宽大相结合的政策。这里的“宽大”并不是“无边”的，而是“首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖”三者不可偏废的政策。至于我们的民事政策，则是保障全体人民的合法利益的，不是只保护某一部分人民，而不保护另一部分人民的利益的。因此，应该纠正一部分司法人员在执行民事政策时没有正确保护诉讼当事人的具体合法利益所发生的某些偏差。同时我们也应该认识，作为人民民主专政武器之一的监狱，是为维护法纪、惩罚罪犯的工具。狱政政策应该是以惩罚与教育相结合。片面地强调教育是错误的；单纯的惩罚而不对犯人进行教育也是不对的。总之，要正确地执行审判工作中的民刑政策，就一定要根据共同纲领办事。只有站在共同纲领的立场上，站在人民的立场上，为最大多数人民的最大利益服务，才能做好人民的司法工作。
    全国司法会议还批评了目前人民法院工作中没有抓住工作中心和积案的现象。为了减少与清理积案，应该纠正违法地乱捕乱押的错误；应该加强公安与检察工作；应该加强区村的调解工作，并尽量运用群众的组织力量，减少纠纷。如对于某些民事或某些可以调解的轻微刑事案件，可以考虑由区村调解和工会、农会及其他人民团体组织仲裁会、同志审判会等方式来解决。不应送到法院处理的案件就不要送交法院。这样才便于人民法院集中力量处理反革命的、破坏经济建设的及其他重要的案件。
    在人民司法机关的组织与制度上，不但要彻底打碎过去国民党政府反人民的官僚机构，而且要废除它所遗留的繁琐、迟滞和扰民害民的诉讼程序。要建立便利人民、联系人民、便于吸收广大群众参加活动的人民司法的组织和制度。我们现在的人民法院，已经不收讼费，手续简便。各级人民法院都设有值日制或问事处，及时为群众处理纠纷。而且，为了联系与教育人民，更有公开审判制、旁听发言制、陪审制、巡回审判和就地审判、调解制度、法纪宣教制度以及在群众中推行仲裁会、同志审判会等方式。这些都是我们的群众路线在人民法院的组织与制度上的反映。这些是应该继续坚持与发扬的。
    我们人民司法机关的工作作风是实事求是的、大公无私的、廉洁奉公的、为人民服务的革命作风，因而人民司法工作者必须具有人民的立场、群众观点与实事求是的品质。我们要坚决扫除国民党反人民的司法机关的专横武断、贪赃舞弊、残害人民的罪恶行为及其残余作风。
    当然，干部是决定一切的。目前人民司法工作干部质量不足的困难，是应该加以解决的。首先，各级人民政府应该设法为其所属的司法机关，调配一定数量与质量的老干部作骨干，以便于健全人民司法机构，更好地掌握政策，建立良好作风。其次，就要大力培养新干部，这是解决干部问题的基本方向。除了司法部门应开办训练班以外，更要办好现有各大学的法律系，使各大学法律系能适应人民司法工作的需要。其三是改造旧司法人员。关于司法干部的训练与培养，单靠各级司法机关自己解决是有困难的，还要依靠各级政府予以支持与帮助。
    这一次全国司法会议，不但在基本上解决了有关人民司法工作的若干主要的政策思想和原则问题，而且讨论了我国新的刑法大纲、人民法院暂行组织条例、诉讼程序通则、犯人改造暂行条例、公司法等草案。大家清楚地看到了这些法律草案，与反动的六法全书在本质上的不同，同时，对于这些法律草案提供了修正的意见。大家看到了中央人民政府是怎样有计划、有步骤地草拟与制定保护人民的法律、法令。同时，会议对于负有检举违法人员、督励守法人员的人民检察机关的性质、任务、组织和工作制度，以及人民检察机关和人民法院、人民监察机关、人民公安机关的相互关系等项问题，也都交换了意见，得到了一致的认识。
    我们希望全国各级人民司法工作的干部，根据这一次全国司法会议的精神，对于目前人民司法工作中的政策思想、工作制度和工作作风，进行系统的检查与总结，以此作为人民司法干部的整风内容，展开批评与自我批评，使人民司法工作干部的思想政策水平与业务能力提高一步。我们还希望各级人民政府与人民团体，给予人民司法的建设以多方面的督促与帮助，并向人民群众经常系统地进行关于人民法纪的宣传教育工作，使我国人民司法工作进一步加强起来，以便迅速系统地建立人民司法制度，巩固我们人民民主专政的国家制度。
