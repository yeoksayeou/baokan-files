Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 19th: In recent days, the water levels upstream of the Yangtze and Han Rivers have risen sharply. People along the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei Province are working hard to protect the dikes. On the Yangtze River, the water level at Cuntan, Chongqing, rose sharply by 3.62 meters on the 16th of this month and another 5.62 meters on the 17th, reaching 199.38 meters, approaching the dangerous water level there. On the Han River, the water level at Baihe rose sharply by 2.1 meters on the 16th of this month. Although it dropped by 1.2 meters on the 17th, it may continue to rise. The Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters has urgently telegraphed flood control headquarters in various special districts and counties along the Yangtze and Han Rivers in the province to pay close attention to prevention.

　　After the summer flood this year, various places along the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei Province have vigorously carried out dike inspection and repair projects to better overcome the autumn flood. The Dongjing River dike in Mianyang County was once in danger in mid-July. Now, the floodwater in the submerged areas of the county has completely receded, and the Dongjing River dike has also been repaired by nearly 10,000 laborers under the leadership of the county's flood control headquarters and is still under construction. People in Cenhe District, Jiangling, have found 29 ant nests, 56 badger holes, and one waterlogged area on the Yangtze River dike, and the repair project involves about 6,000 cubic meters of earthwork, which was mostly completed by the end of July. Various places along the Yangtze and Han Rivers have also combined the summary of the previous stage of flood control experience, commended those who have contributed to flood control, criticized those who have been ineffective, and strengthened flood control organizations at all levels to meet the upcoming autumn flood.

    湖北人民加紧护堤
    积极准备更好地战胜秋汛
    【新华社汉口十九日电】长江、汉水上游日来水势猛涨，湖北省长江、汉水沿岸人民正在努力防护堤线。长江方面，重庆寸滩水位于本月十六日陡涨三点六二公尺，十七日又上涨五点六二公尺，水位高达一九九点三八公尺，已接近该处危险水位。汉水方面，白河水位本月十六日陡涨二点一公尺，十七日虽下降一点二公尺，但仍有续涨可能。湖北省防汛指挥部已急电该省长江、汉水沿岸各专区及县防汛指挥部密切注意防范。
    湖北省沿长江、汉水各地，在今年夏汛过后，即已大力进行查堤和修补堤防工程，准备更好地战胜秋汛。该省沔阳县东荆河堤在七月中旬曾一度出险，现该县被淹地河水已全部退去，东荆河堤亦经该县近万民工在该县防汛指挥部领导下努力加修，现尚在继续赶筑中。江陵岑河区人民共查出长江堤上蚁窝二十九个，獾洞五十六个，浸水一处，修补工程约六千个土方，至七月底已大部完成。沿江、汉各地并结合总结上一阶段的防汛经验，表扬防汛当中的有功者，批评不力人员，加强各级防汛组织，以迎接即将到来的秋汛。
