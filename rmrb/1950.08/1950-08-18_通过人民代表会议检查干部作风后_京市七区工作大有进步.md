Following the People's Representative Conference Inspection of Cadre Work Style, Great Progress Made in Work of Seven Districts of Beijing

[Our Newspaper News] Reporter Pei Lan reports: The Seventh District of Beijing, through its first District People's Representative Conference, inspected the shortcomings in the work of various departments of the district government, initially rectified the ideological work style of the cadres, and enabled the district's work to achieve many successes.

At the District People's Representative Conference, the representatives reflected the opinions of the masses, and the criticisms of the Mediation Section and the Civil Affairs Section of the district government were relatively numerous, believing that they did not handle cases meticulously enough, did not take care of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers adequately, and were sometimes very blunt in their attitude. After the representative conference, the comrades in the Mediation Section and the Civil Affairs Section accepted the opinions of the masses and made relatively deep self-criticisms. In order to quickly resolve various cases of the masses, the district government, in accordance with the instructions of the municipal government and the municipal court, transferred twenty-seven cadres from various departments of the district and organized a temporary trial team to cooperate with the four comrades of the Mediation Section to handle backlog cases. In just nine days, they handled a total of one hundred and seven cases, paying special attention to investigation and research, patiently soliciting the opinions of both parties involved, and the masses unanimously believed that the handling of cases was now faster and more reasonable than before. In July, the comrades of the Civil Affairs Section conducted an in-depth investigation into the difficulties in the lives of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers during the heavy rain, and actively distributed relief grain of 2,675 jin of millet to 144 households of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers in the district. They also took 5.4 million yuan as capital to establish a firewood factory and organize the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers for production. Many families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers said, "The District Representative Conference really works."

In the past, if the masses had opinions about the government, some did not dare to express them publicly and used anonymous letters to reflect them. Now, if the masses have anything to discuss, they directly consult with the government. The masses in Xia Si Tiao, Xi Si Kuai Yu and other places in the district sent representatives to the district government to discuss repairing the dirt road. The district government immediately sent cadres and representatives to the respective places to understand the actual situation, discussed with the masses, and established a road repair committee, led by district cadres, to assist the masses in repairing the road, which was quickly repaired. The masses of Mile Temple Street requested that the earthen platform outside the Mile Temple be removed to pave the road. This was a demand that had existed among the masses for many years, but because a Kuomintang patrol officer had been living here, the demands of the masses could not be realized. This time, the Seventh District Government, based on the opinions of the masses, conducted a detailed investigation and understanding, criticized the illegal behavior of the pseudo patrol officer in occupying public land, and helped the masses to remove the earthen platform.

Because the cadres went deep into the masses, the masses dared to boldly express their opinions, and the government was able to discover problems at any time and solve the problems that the masses urgently demanded to be solved in a timely manner. The Seventh District is the poorest district in Beijing, and many houses are dilapidated. There are more than 1,800 houses in the district that urgently need repair. After the District People's Representative Conference was held, the district cadres and the police stations made a detailed investigation and held a symposium for landlords and tenants. They thoroughly publicized the urban housing policy, repeatedly explained to the masses the advantages and disadvantages of repairing and not repairing, and mobilized the landlords and tenants to negotiate and cooperate in repairing. Some landlords reduced the rent for three months and the tenants repaired it themselves; some landlords provided wood and the tenants provided labor; some landlords were unwilling to repair, excusing themselves that they could not afford it, and after listening to the district government's earnest advice, they automatically brought the wood placed elsewhere and cooperated with the tenants to repair it. As of mid-July, a total of 431 houses had been repaired in the district. During the heavy rain in July, a total of more than 1,200 houses collapsed in the Seventh District, of which 408 were completely collapsed. During the heavy rain, the district chief led the cadres, in cooperation with the police stations, to conduct door-to-door inspections. The residents of houses that were about to collapse were evacuated and placed in empty civilian houses, temples and Lida Middle School buildings, and the residents who could not work due to the rain and had difficulties in life were given relief. A total of 7,379 jin of millet were distributed to 392 households, a total of 1,144 people. Therefore, although many houses collapsed in the Seventh District, no major unfortunate events occurred except for three people who were slightly injured by being hit.

After the Seventh District Government rectified the ideological work style of the cadres through the People's Representative Conference, in addition to achieving the above-mentioned achievements in work, it also improved the internal work system. In the past, the formalism in the district's meeting system was overcome. Now, various meetings centered on inspection and work arrangement are held every week to study and solve major issues in the district, and a two-hour study system is adhered to every day.

### 通过人民代表会议检查干部作风后  京市七区工作大有进步

　　通过人民代表会议检查干部作风后
    京市七区工作大有进步
    【本报讯】记者培蓝报道：京市第七区通过第一次区各界人民代表会议，检查了区政府各部门工作中的缺点，初步整顿了干部的思想作风，使该区的工作获得了许多成绩。
    在区人民代表会议上，代表们反映了群众的意见，对本区区政府调解科、民政科的批评比较多，认为他们处理案件不细致，对烈军干属照顾不够周到，有时态度很生硬。代表会议后，调解科、民政科的同志们，接受了群众的意见，作了比较深刻的检讨。为了迅速解决群众的各种案件，区政府遵照市府、市法院的指示，从区各部门抽调了二十七个干部，组织了一个临时审判组，协同调解科的四个同志，处理积案。他们在短短九天当中，共处理了一百零七件案子，并特别注重调查研究，耐心地征求双方当事人的意见，群众一致认为现在处理案件比从前又快又合理。七月间，民政科同志在大雨中深入调查烈军干属生活的困难，主动地发给该区一百四十四户烈军干属救济粮共二千六百七十五斤小米。又拿五百四十万元作资金，成立了一个劈柴厂，组织烈军干属生产。好多烈军干属都说：“区代表会到底起作用。”
    过去群众对政府有意见，有的不敢公开提出来而用匿名信来反映。现在，群众有什么事情，直接找政府商量。该区下四条、西四块玉等处群众，派代表到区政府商量修理土路，区政府马上派干部和代表一块到各该地了解实际情况，和群众商量，成立了修路委员会，由区干部领导，协助群众进行修理，很快就把路修好了。弥勒庵街群众要求把弥勒庵庙外的土台子拆掉垫路，这是群众中多年来就存在的一个要求，但是因为这里一向住着一个国民党巡官，群众的要求不能实现。这次七区政府根据群众的意见，详细调查了解之后，批评了该伪巡官霸占公地的违法行为，并帮助群众拆掉土台子。
    由于干部深入群众，群众敢于大胆提意见，政府也就能随时发现问题，及时地解决群众迫切要求解决的问题。七区是京市最穷的区，房子破漏的很多，全区有一千八百多间房子急待修理。开过区人民代表会议以后，区干部与各派出所一起作了周详的调查，召开了房主房客座谈会。深入宣传了城市房屋政策，向群众反复解释修与不修的利弊，发动房主房客协商合作修理。有的房主少收三个月房租，由房客自己修理；有的房主出木料，房客出工修理；有些房主不愿修理，借口修不起，听了区政府的谆谆劝告，即自动将放在别处的木料拿来，协同房客修理。至七月中旬止，全区共修理了房屋四百三十一间。七月间下大雨后，七区共塌了一千二百多间房子，其中完全倒塌的有四百零八间。大雨当中，区长带领干部，配合派出所逐户进行检查，快要倒塌的房子，即将住户迁出，安置在空民房、庙院与立达中学校舍内，并救济了因雨不能作工、生活很困难的住户。共发给三百九十二户，一千一百四十四人的救济粮七千三百七十九斤小米。所以，七区虽塌了不少房子，但除三个人被砸受了轻伤以外，并未发生巨大不幸事件。
    七区政府通过人民代表会议整顿干部思想作风以后，除在工作上获得了上述的成绩外，并健全了内部的工作制度。过去该区会议制度中的形式主义毛病被克服了，现在每周举行以检查及布置工作为中心的各种会议，研究解决区里的重大问题，并坚持了每天两小时的学习制度。
