[Report from our newspaper] Religious figures in Beijing have received reporters from this newspaper or written to this newspaper to issue statements, condemning US imperialism's aggression in Taiwan and Korea, and protesting US aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of peaceful Korean people.

　　Ju Zan
　　Ju Zan, a democratic representative of religious circles in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (Buddhist), said: Buddhism is anti-aggression, so of course we oppose US imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Therefore, we should call on Buddhists all over the world to stand on the side of anti-aggression. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chinese Buddhists also did their best for the anti-Japanese effort. At that time, they even planned with Japanese progressives such as Kaji Wataru to use the power of Buddhism to call on Japanese soldiers to oppose aggression, but this proposal was obstructed by the Kuomintang reactionary government. Today we can launch a movement to call on Buddhists around the world to unite against aggression. A few days ago, it was reported that the Buddhist Faith Association, the Buddhist Youth Society, and the Women's Buddhist Association of Seoul jointly held a meeting in response to General Kim Il Sung's call, and 1,300 people voluntarily joined the People's Self-Defense Forces after the meeting. It can be seen that the Buddhists in Korea have recognized the meaning of the war of liberation and are unanimously using actions to help the revolutionary cause. Chinese Buddhists are indeed very happy to know this news. Taking the facts of Korean Buddhists as an example, the vast number of Taiwanese Buddhists will certainly come forward when they are liberated.
    Zhao Zichen
    Zhao Zichen, a democratic representative of religious circles in the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Dean of the School of Religion at Yenching University (Christian), wrote a letter to this newspaper, which said: "Christianity advocates justice, peace, democracy, and freedom. Now US imperialism's aggression against Korea and interference in the liberation of Taiwan completely violate the truth of Christianity. I sincerely appeal to the one million fellow believers in the church to unite and support the government, and wholeheartedly oppose the aggressive acts of US imperialism."
    Jiang Changchuan
    Jiang Changchuan, Bishop of the North China Christian Association, also stated: "Christianity has always advocated justice and peace. As Christians, we must oppose the barbaric acts of US imperialism against the Korean people, such as indiscriminate bombing."
    Wang Zizhong
    Pastor Wang Zizhong, General Secretary of the North China Christian Association, said: "The US imperialist armed action against Korea is interference in the internal affairs of another country. The Korean people have been oppressed by Japan for many years, and of course they desire national independence and unification. It is the Korean people's own business to believe in what ideology they want. Why should the United States interfere? The result is that they ran into a brick wall and suffered the consequences. As for the US imperialists' attempt to obstruct our country's liberation of Taiwan, it is obviously an act of aggression, but they can never stop the powerful force of our People's Liberation Army. Taiwan will inevitably be liberated, and history can never be reversed."
    Wang Lianyu
    Wang Lianyu, Imam of the Hui Muslims, said: "Our Hui people, like other fraternal nationalities, will always advocate peace and justice. We will definitely use all our strength to support the People's Liberation Army in defeating US imperialism and its running dog, the remnant Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and liberate Taiwan."

### 宗教界人士发表谈话  斥责美帝侵略台湾朝鲜  抗议美机滥炸朝鲜人民

    斥责美帝侵略台湾朝鲜  抗议美机滥炸朝鲜人民
    【本报讯】北京宗教界人士分别接见本报记者或写信给本报发表谈话，斥责美国帝国主义侵略台湾、朝鲜，并抗议美国飞机滥炸朝鲜和平人民。
    巨赞
    人民政协宗教界民主人士代表巨赞法师（佛教）说：佛教是反侵略的，我们当然反对美国帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜。因此，我们应该号召全世界的佛教徒，站在反侵略的一面。在抗战时期，中国的佛教徒对于抗日工作也曾尽过力量。当时，并曾与日本进步人士鹿地亘等人计划以佛教的力量号召日本士兵反侵略，但这一建议竟遭国民党反动政府阻挠。今天我们可以展开号召世界佛教徒团结反侵略的运动。前几天报载汉城的佛教信仰协会、佛教青年社和女佛教徒协会为响应金日成将军的号召，联合举行会议，会后有一千三百人自动参加人民自卫军。可见朝鲜的佛教徒已认清了解放战争的意义，一致用行动来帮助革命大业。我国佛教徒知道了这个消息的确非常高兴。以朝鲜佛教徒的事实做例子，广大的台湾佛教徒，一定也能够在解放的时候挺身而出。
    赵紫宸
    人民政协宗教界民主人士代表、燕京大学宗教学院院长赵紫宸（基督教）写信给本报，信中说：“基督教主张公道、和平、民主、自由。现在美国帝国主义侵略朝鲜，干涉台湾的解放，完全违反了基督教的真理。我竭诚向教中一百万同道呼吁，要大家同心合意，拥护政府，全力反对美国帝国主义的侵略行为。”
    江长川
    华北基督教联合会江长川会督也表示：“基督教一向是主张正义、和平的。美国帝国主义对朝鲜人民的滥施轰炸等残暴行为，我们作为基督徒的人，必然反对。”
    王梓仲
    华北基督教联合会总干事王梓仲牧师说：“美国帝国主义对朝鲜的武装行动是干涉他国内政。朝鲜人民受日本压迫多年，当然愿望国家独立、统一。愿意信奉什么主义是朝鲜人民自己的事，美国凭什么要干涉？结果是碰了大钉子，是自讨苦吃。至于美帝企图阻挠我国解放台湾，显然是侵略行为，但是他们绝对阻挡不住我们人民解放军的强大力量，台湾必然可以解放，历史绝对不能扭转。”
    王连钰
    回教王连钰阿訇说：“我们回族人民和其他兄弟民族一样，永远主张和平与正义。我们一定拿出我们所有的力量，支援人民解放军击败美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石残余匪帮，解放台湾。”
