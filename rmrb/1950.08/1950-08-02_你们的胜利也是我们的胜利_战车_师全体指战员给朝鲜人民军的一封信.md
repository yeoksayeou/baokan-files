Your Victory is Also Our Victory
    — A Letter from All Commanders and Fighters of the Tank ×× Division to the Korean People's Army

    To All Commanders and Fighters of the Korean People's Army:

    Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Syngman Rhee gang launched the Korean civil war. For the independence and unification of your fatherland, you quickly transitioned to a counteroffensive after repelling the invaders' attack. Thanks to your heroic fighting, the Rhee gang's puppet national defense army quickly collapsed. The large-scale armed intervention by U.S. imperialism cannot stop your advance in the slightest.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Korean People's Army have a deep historical friendship. We fought together against the Japanese imperialists, and with the assistance of the Soviet forces, we finally drove the Japanese imperialists out of China and Korea. In this Korean War, we firmly believe that the final victory will surely belong to you. The fact that the Chinese people defeated the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs—the Chiang Kai-shek gang—is the best example.

    Heroic Korean brothers! What you are waging is a just war, and peace-loving people all over the world stand with you. The "Worldwide Week of Active Support for the Korean People" movement has become the mainstream of the current international peace movement.

    In China, the "Week of Resisting U.S. Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea" is being held; in our unit, this movement has been widely and enthusiastically launched.

    All commanders and fighters of our unit are watching the development of the Korean War of Liberation with great concern. Our hearts are closely linked together. On the front line against the war of aggression, your victory is also our victory. We must resolutely liberate Taiwan, just as you must resolutely liberate southern Korea. Heroic Korean brothers, let us move forward bravely with confidence in victory! U.S. imperialists are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. The claws they have stretched out to Taiwan and Korea will surely be cut off by us! Failure awaits the American robbers, and final victory belongs to the people of China and Korea.

    Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!
    Long live General Kim Il-sung!
    Long live the Korean People's Army!

      All Commanders and Fighters of the Tank ×× Division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    July 25, 1950

　　你们的胜利也是我们的胜利
    ——战车××师全体指战员给朝鲜人民军的一封信朝鲜人民军全体指战员们：
    在美帝国主义指使之下，李承晚匪帮发动了朝鲜内战。你们为了祖国的独立和统一，在击退侵略者的进攻后，迅速转入了反攻。由于你们的英勇善战，李匪的伪国防军迅速崩溃了，美帝国主义大规模的武装干涉，也丝毫不能阻挡你们的前进。
    中国人民解放军和朝鲜人民军是有深厚历史友谊的，我们一同反对过日本帝国主义者，在苏联部队的协助下，最后把日本帝国主义者赶出了中国和朝鲜。在这次朝鲜战争中我们坚决相信：最后胜利一定是属于你们的。中国人民战胜美帝国主义者及其走狗——蒋介石匪帮的事实，就是最好的例证。
    英勇的朝鲜兄弟们！你们所进行的是正义的战争，全世界爱好和平的人民都和你们站在一起，“全世界积极支援朝鲜人民周”运动，已经成为当前国际和平运动的主流了。
    在中国，正举行着“反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动周”；我们部队里，已经普遍地热烈地展开了这一运动。
    我们部队全体指战员，以莫大的关心注视着朝鲜解放战争形势的发展。我们的心紧紧地联系在一起。在反对侵略战争的战线上，你们的胜利也是我们的胜利，我们要坚决解放台湾，正像你们要坚决解放南部朝鲜一样。英勇的朝鲜兄弟们，让我们怀着胜利信心，勇敢地迈进吧！美帝国主义者是外强中干的，它伸在台湾和朝鲜的魔爪，一定会被我们斩掉！失败在等待着美国强盗，最后胜利是属于中国和朝鲜人民的。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    金日成将军万岁！
    朝鲜人民军万岁！
      中国人民解放军战车××师全体指战员
    一九五○年七月二十五日
