　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, August 26th, TASS: "L'Humanité" published a resolution passed by the Politburo of the French Communist Party, again protesting the American imperialists and other colonial countries' aggression against Korea, and exposing the criminal decision of the Pleven-Moch government to send a French expeditionary force to Korea. The resolution pointed out that this decision violated the French constitution's stipulation that France "shall never use its forces against the freedom of any people," and reflected the French government's attempt to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean War. The French Communist Party Politburo called on the working class and the French people to unite in action to express their solidarity with the Korean people who are fighting for their national independence and unification.
    The French Communist Party Politburo believes that the assassination of the Chairman of the Belgian Communist Party, Lahaut, the attempted assassination of another leader of the Belgian Communist Party, and the numerous attacks on French democratic groups prove that the warmongers intend to use fascist atrocities and American gangster tactics in an attempt to crush the growing resistance of the people of all countries to their criminal plans. The French Communist Party Politburo called on all French people, regardless of their views, to unite against the crimes committed by foreign-instigated assassins, to strengthen vigilance, and to protect the members and organizations of democratic groups.

　　法共政治局通过决议反对法政府派兵侵朝
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社巴黎二十六日讯：“人道报”发表法国共产党政治局通过决议，再度抗议美帝国主义者及其他殖民国家侵略朝鲜，并揭发普利文——摩勒政府派遣法国远征军赴朝鲜的罪恶决定。决议指出，这个决定违反了法国宪法关于法国“决不使用其军队反对任何民族自由”的规定，并且反映了法政府力图阻挠朝鲜战争的和平解决。法共政治局号召工人阶级及法国人民联合行动，以表示与争取祖国独立与统一的朝鲜人民同其同仇敌忾。
    法共政治局认为：比利时共产党主席拉豪特的遇害和阴谋暗杀比共另一领袖的企图，以及对法国各民主团体所进行的多次攻击，证明战争贩子们打算采用法西斯暴行及美国暴徒手段，力图击破各国人民对他们的罪恶计划日益增长的抵抗。法共政治局号召一切法国人，不管见解如何，一致反对外国主使的暗杀者所犯的罪行，并加强警惕，保护民主团体的成员以及各民主团体的组织。
