City of Young Pioneers in Czechoslovakia
    Our reporter Hua Junwu
    In Czechoslovakia, we visited several Young Pioneer Homes and a Young Pioneer City. These are Young Pioneer organizations. The Young Pioneer Homes are used for activities by the youngsters during their spare time, on Sundays, or other holidays. Each Young Pioneer Home has a beautiful building. The equipment inside is naturally very exquisite, and the outdoor environment is also very beautiful, with gardens, lawns, trees, and sports fields. Inside the houses are conference rooms, reading rooms, treatment rooms for sudden illnesses and temporary injuries, temporary dormitories for Young Pioneer representatives from other cities to sleep in, and movie screening rooms. Some Young Pioneer Homes, such as the one in Brno, also have small theaters and Czech-style puppet theaters. These theaters have the same equipment as formal theaters, with lighting and dressing rooms for male and female actors. In addition to this, the Young Pioneer Homes have a great feature, which is that while conducting political education, they also conduct various natural science education and technical exercises. They have rooms for cultivating organisms, various insect and mineral specimens, radio transceiver equipment, construction models and principles of airplanes, motorcycles, trains, and ships, milling machines, planers, drilling machines, smelting and sand turning machines and equipment, printing presses, etc. The Young Pioneers here do ironwork and carpentry experiments, and the city's most famous labor heroes come to teach them how to use the machines, which is of course a very meaningful thing. From this organization, the Young Pioneers not only learn politics and culture but also understand various scientific knowledge, cultivate their labor perspective, and exercise their healthy physiques. In another ten years, they will become important construction talents for the country. Each Young Pioneer Home has staff responsible for management, many of whom are members of the Czech Youth League (CSM). They told us that the Czech Young Pioneers like the Young Pioneer Homes very much.
    This time we visited a Young Pioneer City, which is built near Karlovy Vary (also known as Carlsbad), a famous scenic area and sanatorium in not only Czechoslovakia but also Europe. In a valley full of lush green fir and cypress forests, a small river flows through it. A month ago, this was still a small forest, but now there are more than a dozen colorful, beautiful wooden houses mixed in the forest. This city was established by the Karlovy Vary District Committee and the Youth League. The city covers an area of four square kilometers. When we went, groups of Young Pioneers lined up from the forest to welcome us. They wore white shirts and dark blue shorts or skirts, with red Young Pioneer-style scarves.
    The establishment of this city is very interesting. Originally, there were ten districts in Karlovy Vary. The people of each district paid their own money and manpower to build a wooden house for the Young Pioneer City. From the wood, bricks, and tiles used for construction to the beds, tables, and chairs in the house, the district was responsible for building. Workers in each district used their spare time or Sunday holidays to do voluntary work for the Young Pioneers. They made all the utensils, engineers designed the house plans, painters, carpenters, and workers painted and built the houses, and other workers made iron beds, quilts, and pillows. Each wooden house has its own style. After it is built, the name of the district is used as the name of the house, such as Marienbad, etc. The Sokolov district's house is also painted with beautiful Czech folk-style patterns on the outside, and some roofs also have colored sculptures of male and female Young Pioneers. In short, each district wants to decorate their wooden house the most beautifully. In addition, the railway workers also built a six-kilometer-long small railway for the Young Pioneer City and built small locomotives and carriages. They are now preparing to build small stations and signaling equipment. The army built a bridge for them and is also preparing to dig a swimming pool. The Karlovy Vary District Committee is also preparing to build a wooden house. A sanatorium will also be built in the Young Pioneer City so that the Young Pioneers in the city can receive treatment and recuperation when they are sick. There is also a cinema.
    Each wooden house has bedrooms and bathrooms. When we went, the secretary of the Marienbad District Committee was inspecting the houses in their district, and three painters were whistling and painting the lemon-yellow wooden house. The people of each district also sent many books, sports equipment, musical instruments, cameras, and radios. Some have already been placed in the house, and some are still piled up in small rooms. There is already a library of 1,000 juvenile books here. The comrades in charge of the Young Pioneer City said that the Young Pioneers are very enthusiastic about reading. Some Young Pioneers finish a book in two or three days.
    The Young Pioneers have a center for work and study every week. The week we went, their center was the construction of the city and the history of the city's construction. Next week, they will focus on the issue of world peace. They require the Young Pioneers to exercise well in order to defend world peace. They publish newspapers, from editing and reporters to printing, all by themselves. They told us that the news of our visit to this city would be in the newspaper the next day. The person in charge of the Young Pioneer City said that here, they want to enable the Young Pioneers to build and manage their city just like building and managing their country.
    An international Young Pioneer camp will be held here next year, and they hope that representatives from the Chinese Young Pioneers will also participate.
    Not only in this city, but also in the Young Pioneer Home in Jablonec, many male and female Young Pioneers asked us about the situation of the Chinese Young Pioneers. Unfortunately, we have been abroad for a long time and do not know much about this aspect. We only told them a story about the Young Pioneers in the liberated areas during the Anti-Japanese War standing guard, patrolling, and arresting traitors. They asked to communicate with the Chinese Young Pioneers. They also hoped that the Chinese Young Pioneers would write letters and send photos to them. They wanted us to tell the Chinese Young Pioneers about their situation and asked me to tell the Chinese Young Pioneers their address.
    After visiting the Young Pioneers in Czechoslovakia, I also saw how the Czech Party, government, and people love their young generation.

　　捷克少先队之城
    本报记者  华君武
    我们在捷克斯洛伐克曾经参观了几个城市的少先队之家和一个少先队之城，这些都是少先队的组织，少先队之家都是利用少年们在课余，星期天或其它假期中来进行活动的。每一个少先队之家都有一幢漂亮的房屋。屋中的设备自然非常精致，室外的环境也非常美丽，有花园、草地、树木、和运动场；屋内有会议室，阅览室，急病和临时创伤的治疗室，给外城少年队代表睡觉的临时宿舍、电影放映室，有的少先队之家，例如在波尔诺城的，还有小剧场和捷克流行的傀儡剧场。这些剧场都有正式剧场那样的设备，灯光照明，男女演员的化妆室等。除此以外少先队之家还有一个很大的特点，这就是和进行政治教育同时，也进行各种自然科学的教育，和技术的练习，它们有培养生物的房间，各种昆虫，矿物的标本，无线电收发设备，飞机，摩托车，火车，轮船的构造模型和原理，有铣床、刨床，钻床，冶炼和翻沙的机器和设备，印刷机等等，少先队员们在这里做铁工和木工的实验，而且有城中最有名的劳动英雄来教授他们如何使用机器，这当然是一件很有意义的事。少先队员们从这个组织中不但学习政治、文化而且也懂得各种科学的知识，培养着他们的劳动观点，锻炼他们的健康体格，再过十年以后，他们就将成为国家的重要建设人材了。每一少先队之家都有工作人员在负责管理，许多是捷克青年联盟（ＣＳＭ）的青年团员。他们告诉我们，捷克少先队员们都非常喜欢少先队之家。
    这一次我们去参观的是一个少先队之城，它是建筑在不但捷克有名而且是欧洲有名的风景区和疗养中心——卡洛维·伐来城（又名卡尔浴场）的附近。一个充满着葱绿色的杉树和柏树林的峡谷中，有一条小河从中流过，一个月以前这里还是一片小森林，而现在已经有十几幢有颜色的，漂亮的小木屋，参杂在树林中了；这个城是由卡洛维·伐来区委和青年联盟所主持建立的，城的面积占四平方公里，我们去的时候，少先队员们一组一组的从树林中排队出来欢迎我们，他们和她们穿着白色的衬衣和深蓝色的短裤或裙子，打着红色的少先队式的领巾。
    谈起这个城的建立是很有趣味的，原来卡洛维·伐来区有十个小区。每一个小区的人民自己出钱出人力来为少先队之城建筑一所木屋。从建筑用的木材砖瓦一直到屋内的床桌椅子都由这个区来负责建造，每一区的工人利用工余或星期日的休假时间来为少先队做义务工作。他们制造了一切用具，工程师设计房屋的图样，漆匠木匠工人等油漆和建筑房屋，其它的工人做铁床、被子和枕头。每一幢木屋都有各自的式样，造成后就以这个小区的名字来作为这个小屋的名字，例如玛丽浴场等；梭珂洛芙区的房子外边还画着捷克民族风味的美丽图案，有的房顶上还立着两个男女少先队的彩色雕塑。总之各个区都想把他们的木屋装饰得最美丽。除此以外，铁路工人还为少先队之城建筑了六公里长的小铁路，造了小的火车头和车厢。现在正准备造小车站和信号设备；军队为他们造了一座桥，还准备挖一个游泳池；卡洛维·伐来的区委也准备造一幢木屋，少先队之城中还要建筑一所休养所；以便城中的少先队员生病时得到治疗和休养，另外还有一座电影院。
    每一幢木屋中有寝室、浴室，我们去时，玛丽浴场区的区委书记正在视察他们这区的房屋，三个漆匠工人也正在吹着口哨为这房屋油漆着柠檬黄色的木屋。每一区的人民还送了许多书籍、运动器具、乐器、照相机和收音机。有的已经陈设在屋内，有的还堆满在小房间里。这里已经有一千册少年读物的图书室。少先队之城的负责同志说，少先队员们非常热心地阅读，有的少先队员两三天就读完一本书呢。
    少先队每一周有一工作和学习的中心，我们去的那一星期，他们的中心就是城的建筑，和城的建筑历史。下一周他们将以世界和平问题为中心，他们要求少先队员们好好锻炼身体才可以保卫世界和平。他们出有报纸，从编辑、记者到印刷都由自己担任，他们告诉我们第二天的报纸就有我们来访问这个城的消息了。少先队之城的负责人说，在这里要使得少先队员们，建设和管理他们的城，如同建设和管理他们的国家一样。
    明年将要在这里举行国际少先队营，他们希望中国的少先队也有代表来参加。
    不仅在这个城中，就是在雅不罗乃茨城的少先队之家里，许多男女少先队员们都问我们中国少先队的情况，可惜我们出国较久，这方面的情况也都不很了解，我们只讲了一个在抗日战争中解放区少先队站岗放哨捉汉奸的故事给他们听。他们要求和中国的少先队通讯，他们也希望中国少先队写信和寄照片给他们，他们要我们把他们的情况转告给中国少先队，并且要我把他们的地址告诉中国的少先队。
    参观了捷克的少先队，同时也看到捷克的党、政府和人民是怎样地热爱着他们年轻的一代。
