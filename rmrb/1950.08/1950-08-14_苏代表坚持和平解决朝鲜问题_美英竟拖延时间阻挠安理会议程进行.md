Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 13th: The Security Council met again on the 11th, under the chairmanship of Malik, to discuss the Korean issue.

Since August 1st, the United States and its satellite states have been conducting a campaign to obstruct the proceedings of the meeting, attempting to prevent the Security Council from peacefully resolving the Korean issue. On the 10th, Austin played another trick to hinder the meeting, which was to deliver a lengthy speech, intending to waste time and prevent the Security Council from considering the Soviet proposal to establish peace in Korea.

On the 11th, reactionary newspapers reflecting the opinions of the US-British bloc indicated that the US satellite states would continue to employ their usual tactics on the 11th, and predicted that British representative Jebb would deliver a lengthy speech, repeating Austin's arguments.

After Chairman Malik announced the opening of the meeting, he immediately sought ways to break the deadlock in the Security Council, a deadlock caused by the US-British bloc's manipulation of obstructive tactics. Malik pointed out that the Security Council had prolonged the discussion of the issue of Korean representatives' attendance. He pointed out that there were two proposals on this issue: one was the Soviet proposal that the Security Council should hear the grievances of the representatives of the Korean people, including representatives from both North and South Korea; the other was a proposal that the Security Council should consider the invitation issued to the South Korean representative on June 25th as still valid. Malik declared that the Soviet delegation believed that the Security Council should vote on these two proposals, voting first on the Soviet proposal and then on the second proposal. Malik said that after voting on this issue, the three proposals regarding the Korean situation awaiting the Security Council's decision could be discussed.

Malik continued: The Soviet delegation insists on a vote. If there are no other opinions, the Security Council will proceed to a vote unless the scheduled speaker insists on speaking first.

However, British representative Jebb, executing the tactics of the US-British bloc, opposed the vote, saying that he wanted to make a speech to explain why he opposed the procedure suggested by Malik.

Malik pointed out at this time that what he was proposing was a vote, and the duty of the chairman was to conduct the vote.

Although Malik's suggestion was clearly aimed at breaking the deadlock in the Security Council in order to enable the Security Council to engage in discussions on the Korean issue, Austin vehemently opposed it, claiming that if the Security Council accepted the procedure proposed by Malik, it would mean that the Security Council was yielding to a "wrong ruling" and acknowledging the disruption of the procedural rules of the Security Council. Austin said that if Malik's statement could be regarded as a "ruling," then he opposed this "ruling."

Malik asked Austin to clarify which "ruling" he was "opposing." Malik reiterated that the chairman had not made any rulings. The Soviet delegation had consistently requested a vote, and therefore, the chairman requested the Security Council to decide whether to put the Soviet delegation's proposal to a vote in accordance with the Soviet delegation's suggestion. The Security Council has the right to decide on this issue.

In his reply, Austin attempted to create a new confusing situation. Although Malik had made it clear that he was suggesting that the Security Council decide whether to allow the speakers to continue the debate or to put the Soviet delegation's proposal to a vote, Austin claimed that Malik had attempted to directly put the Soviet proposal to a vote, and that this could supposedly constitute a "ruling."

Austin's purpose was now very clear, so Malik proposed that the discussion was already protracted, and therefore, if Austin insisted on obstructing the issue that had been discussed in two meetings, he believed that the next speaker, British representative Jebb, should be allowed to speak.

Jebb then delivered a lengthy speech, requesting the Security Council to hear the opinions of the Lee Seung-man representative, but refusing to hear the opinions of the representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. He reiterated the pretext that the North Koreans attacked South Korea. He said that even if the Korean situation constituted a civil war, the Security Council had the right to interfere in domestic affairs if such a situation involved a breach of peace. Furthermore, although the delegations of two permanent members of the Security Council did not attend the meetings in June and July, Jebb insisted that the Security Council's previous resolutions on Korea were all legal.

After making many slanders against the Soviet Union and communism, Jebb accused the Soviet Union's proposals on the Korean issue, believing that their purpose was to export communism to Korea. Jebb further claimed that communism was now concentrating its efforts on activities, and presented the situations in Burma, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, and India as proof. Jebb never mentioned that the United States was the only country responsible for the aggression against Korea. Jebb then strongly opposed issuing invitations to representatives of the Korean people to attend Security Council meetings. He said that the withdrawal of the North Korean army to north of the 38th parallel and adherence to the Security Council's resolutions were prerequisites for possibly inviting North Korea to attend the Security Council.

Malik then spoke as the Soviet representative. Malik said that British representative Jebb's speech only repeated what the US representative had said on August 10th. He pointed out that the Soviet delegation had already explained the aggressive measures taken by the United States in Korea, and had proved with universally recognized definitions that the United States was the aggressor in Korea, a proof that the US representative had been unable to refute.

Thereafter, Malik emphasized that the Security Council's discussion of the Korean issue was based on completely non-objective and one-sided "information" provided by the United States and the Lee Seung-man side. Malik pointed out that Austin quoted the report of the United Nations Commission on Korea signed by the Kuomintang representative of that commission. Malik said that no one could believe the assertions made by representatives of such a corrupt and degenerate regime as the Kuomintang.

Malik further pointed out that the US claims were based on the report of the Korean Commission, which was prepared after the fact, insisting that Lee Seung-man's troops were deployed defensively. However, the report itself showed that at the start of the war, South Korea had five divisions participating in the fighting, while North Korea had only two divisions and one brigade. Thus, Lee Seung-man's troops were deployed along the border for aggression. Malik pointed out that the US claim that Lee Seung-man did not receive artillery was untrue. Even the US newspapers, in their Korean dispatches, admitted that when Lee Seung-man's troops fled before the heroic People's Army, they abandoned a large amount of artillery. Malik declared that the situation in Korea was a replay of the situation in China, where Chiang Kai-shek's armed forces lost the equipment supplied by the US government, which was captured by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. When Austin implied that the North Koreans obtained weapons from the Soviet Union, he was slandering the Soviet Union. Malik pointed out that he had refuted this on August 10th. Malik also said that the warmonger Churchill and his disciples were also slandering the Soviet Union when they claimed that the Soviet Union supplied the North Koreans with aircraft. Malik emphasized that such fabricated slanders had nothing to do with reality.

Malik declared that the US headquarters in Japan and Korea supplied the United Nations Commission on Korea with fabricated information, and now, the United States and its delegation want to use these fabricated reports to accuse the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Malik also stated that the Security Council, based on this fabricated and biased information, passed illegal resolutions regarding the Korean situation in the absence of two permanent members of the Council—the Soviet Union and China. These illegal resolutions are now being used as a pretext for US aggression against Korea.

Malik then cited conversations of US officials and Lee Seung-man group members themselves, proving that the US proposals to the Security Council were unfounded.

Malik pointed out that Lee Seung-man visited MacArthur in Tokyo before the outbreak of the Korean conflict, and Lee Seung-man received MacArthur's order to launch an aggression against North Korea.

Malik also cited Lee Seung-man's speech in Seoul during Dulles' visit and Dulles' reply as further evidence of the Lee Seung-man group and its US masters' aggressive plans. Malik pointed out that the Lee Seung-man group launched an attack on June 25th, and the United States began its aggression on June 27th, a few hours before the Security Council met. Therefore, the US actions confronted the Security Council with a fait accompli. Malik said that the US's open armed intervention was an illegal and arbitrary act.

Malik then cited the supply of a large amount of military equipment, which the US State Department had admitted was supplied to the Lee Seung-man group before the start of the aggression on June 25th, and pointed out that this was further evidence of the US and its puppet Lee Seung-man group's aggressive plans.

Malik also cited the statement made by US Secretary of Defense Johnson before the outbreak of hostilities, which said that the equipment and training of Lee Seung-man's troops had been completed, and that this army was "ready to go to war at any time." Malik further cited the statement by General Roberts, the former head of the US military mission in Korea, reported by New York Herald Tribune reporter Higgins on June 15th. Roberts said that Lee Seung-man's army had become an excellent watchdog to protect US investments.

Malik then said that all these facts show that Austin's assertion that Lee Seung-man's troops were unprepared was false. In addition, Malik cited the confession of a captured South Korean officer who said that his regiment was ordered to cross the 38th parallel to launch an attack, but was repelled by the North Korean garrison. Malik said that after the United States provoked the conflict, its troops immediately launched a direct military aggression. Everyone knows that US troops are ravaging Korean land, everyone knows that it is not Korean planes that are bombing cities like New York, but US planes that are bombing Seoul and other residential areas, and at the same time, US officers shamelessly boast of the tonnage of bombs dropped.

Malik said that MacArthur played a particularly sinister role in the preparations for the Korean conflict, and that he was trying his best to be the god and emperor of Asia, unwilling to return to the United States.

Malik said that in the Korean issue, the United States not only unreasonably violated the United Nations Charter, but also shamelessly used the flag of the United Nations, a symbol of friendship, to cover up its barbaric acts of aggression.

When the United Nations Secretary-General and the US delegation submitted proposals to the member states of the United Nations, they attempted to conceal the illegal nature of these proposals, which were passed in the absence of two members of the Security Council—the Soviet Union and China.

In conclusion, Malik emphasized that the Soviet delegation opposes the US proposal to expand its aggression under the guise of "localizing" the conflict. Malik said that, on the contrary, the Soviet Union seeks a peaceful resolution, suggesting the withdrawal of foreign troops and hearing the appeals from both sides of the Korean conflict.

The Security Council must choose between the path to peace suggested by the Soviet delegation and the path aimed at expanding aggression suggested by the US delegation.

After Malik's speech, the Security Council adjourned and scheduled the next meeting for the 14th.

### 苏代表坚持和平解决朝鲜问题  美英竟拖延时间阻挠安理会议程进行

　　苏代表坚持和平解决朝鲜问题
    美英竟拖延时间阻挠安理会议程进行
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：十一日，安理会在马立克主持下再度开会，讨论朝鲜问题。
    从八月一日开始，美国及其附庸国就一直进行阻挠会议进行的运动，企图阻止安理会和平解决朝鲜问题。十日，奥斯汀又玩弄另一种妨碍会议进行的手腕，这就是发表冗长演说，意图耗费时间并阻止安理会考虑苏联所提在朝鲜建立和平的提议。
    十一日，反映美英集团的意见的反动报纸，表示美国的卫星国将在十一日继续施展其惯技，并预言英国代表杰伯将发表冗长演说，复述奥斯汀的论调。
    主席马立克宣布开会后，便立即寻求打开安理会的僵局的途径，这一僵局是由于美英集团玩弄其妨碍会议进行的手腕而造成的。马立克指出：安理会已拖长了朝鲜代表出席问题的讨论。他指出：关于这个问题有两个提案：其一是苏联提议安理会应听取朝鲜人民代表的申诉，包括北朝鲜与南朝鲜的代表在内；其二是提议安理会应认为六月二十五日对南朝鲜代表所发出的邀请仍然有效。马立克宣称：苏联代表团认为安理会应投票表决这两个提案，首先表决苏联的提案，然后表决第二个提案。马立克说：票决了这个问题之后，才能讨论有待安理会作出决定的关于朝鲜情况的三个提议。
    马立克继称：苏联代表团坚持要表决。如果没有别的意见，除非预定的发言人坚持要先发表演说的话，则安理会将进行表决。
    但是，英国代表杰伯执行美英集团的策略，反对表决，他说：他要发表演说来说明为什么他反对马立克所建议的程序。
    马立克此时指出：他所提议的是要表决，而主席的职责是在进行表决。
    虽然马立克的建议明显地要想打破安理会中的僵局，以期使安理会从事讨论朝鲜问题，但奥斯汀大声反对，他并声称：安理会如接受马立克所提的程序，则将意味着安理会向“错误的裁决”表示屈服，并承认破坏安理会的程序规则。奥斯汀说：如果马立克的声明可当作一个“裁决”，则他反对这个“裁决”。
    马立克要求奥斯汀说明他所“反对”的是那一个“裁决”。马立克再度宣称：主席尚未作过任何裁决。苏联代表团曾不断地要求进行表决，因此，主席要求安理会决定是否要依照苏联代表团的建议提付表决。安理会有权可以决定这个问题。
    奥斯汀在答复中想造成一种新的混乱局面。虽然马立克已明白表示他建议安理会来决定是否让演说的人继续进行辩论抑或把苏联代表团的建议案提付表决，但奥斯汀称：马立克曾企图将苏联建议案直接提付表决，而这据说可以构成为一个“裁决”。
    奥斯汀的目的现已很明显，马立克于是提议：讨论现已有延长之势，因此，如果奥斯汀坚持要阻挠业已在两次会议中讨论了的问题，他认为应让下一发言人——英国代表杰伯发言。
    杰伯随即发表了长篇演说，要求安理会听取李承晚代表的意见，但拒绝听取朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表的意见。他重申北朝鲜人攻击南朝鲜的借口。他说：即使朝鲜局势构成为内战，但安理会也有权干涉国内局势，如果此种局势涉及破坏和平的话。再者，虽然安理会两个常任理事国的代表团未出席六月份与七月份的会议，但杰伯硬说安理会以前关于朝鲜的决议都是合法的。
    杰伯在对苏联及共产主义作了许多毁谤以后，指责苏联的有关朝鲜问题的建议案，认为其目的是想把共产主义输出到朝鲜去。杰伯进一步宣称：共产主义现在正集中力量从事活动，并提出缅甸、印尼、越南、菲律宾及印度的局势作为证明。杰伯从未说到美国是对侵略朝鲜一事负唯一责任的国家。杰伯随即强力地反对发出请柬邀请朝鲜人民的代表出席安理会会议。他说：北朝鲜军撤退到三八线以北及奉行安理会的决议为可能邀请北朝鲜出席安理会的先决条件。
    马立克然后以苏联代表的身份发言。马立克说，英国代表杰伯的演说，只是重复美国代表八月十日所说的话而已。他指出，苏联代表团已经讲明美国在朝鲜采取的侵略措施，并且以普遍承认的定义证明了美国是对朝鲜的侵略者，这个证明美国代表一直无法驳倒。
    其后，马立克强调指出，安理会对朝鲜问题的讨论，是以美国和李承晚方面供给的完全不客观的片面“情报”为根据的。马立克指出奥斯汀引用联合国朝鲜委员会有该委员会国民党代表签名的报告。马立克说，没有人能够相信像国民党这样腐化、堕落的政权的代表所作的断言。
    马立克进一步指出，美国的断言是根据朝鲜委员会的报告，这个报告却是在事实发生之后准备的，硬说李承晚军队是作防御性的展开。可是，这个报告本身就表明了，在战争开始时，南朝鲜有五个师参加战斗，而北朝鲜只有两师和一旅的兵力。这样，李承晚军队沿着边界展开是为了侵略的。马立克指明，美国所说李承晚没有得到大炮的断言是不真实的。即使是美国报纸在其朝鲜通讯中，也承认当李承晚部队在英勇的人民军面前逃跑的时候遗弃了大量的大炮。马立克声称：朝鲜的情势是中国情势的重演，在中国，蒋介石的武装部队丧失了美国政府供给的装备，为中国人民解放军所缴获。当奥斯汀暗示北朝鲜人从苏联获得武器时，他是诽谤苏联。马立克指出：他在八月十日已经驳斥过这件事。马立克又说：战争贩子邱吉尔及其门徒在声称苏联供给北朝鲜人以飞机的时候，也同样是诽谤苏联。马立克强调称：这种捏造的谰言与实际毫不相干。
    马立克声称，日本和朝鲜的美国统帅部供给联合国朝鲜委员会虚构的情报，而现在，美国及其代表团就想借引证这些虚构的报告来控告朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。
    马立克又称：安理会却根据这个虚构的带偏见的情报，在两个常任理事国未出席的情况下，通过了关于朝鲜情势的非法决议。这些非法的决议现在正被利用来作为美国侵略朝鲜的借口。
    马立克于是援引美国官员与李承晚集团分子自己的谈话，证明美国向安理会提出的议案是毫无根据的。
    马立克指出，李承晚在朝鲜冲突爆发前曾经往东京访问麦克阿瑟，李承晚曾接奉麦克阿瑟的命令向北朝鲜发动侵略。
    马立克并且援引李承晚在杜勒斯访问期内在汉城的演说和杜勒斯的答辞，作为李承晚集团及其美国主子们侵略计划的进一步证据。马立克指出，李承晚集团于六月二十五日发动进攻，而美国于六月二十七日，安理会开会前若干小时开始它的侵略。因此，美国的行动使安理会面对着既成事实。马立克说，美国的公开武装干涉是非法的专断行动。
    马立克至此又引证大量的军事装备的供应，美国国务院已承认这些装备是在六月二十五日侵略开始前供给李承晚集团的，他指明这是美国与傀儡李承晚集团侵略计划的进一步证据。
    马立克又援引美国国防部长詹逊在敌对行为爆发前所作的声明，其中说，李承晚军队的装备与训练已经完成，这支军队“随时都能开战”。马立克进一步援引纽约先驱论坛报记者赫金斯于六月十五日所报道的前美国驻朝鲜军事使团团长罗伯茨将军的声明。罗伯茨说，李承晚的军队已成为保护美国投资的出色的看家狗。
    马立克接着说：所有这一切事实，表明奥斯汀断言李承晚部队毫无准备说是虚妄的。此外，马立克引证某南朝鲜被俘军官的口供说：他的那一团人奉命越过三八线发动进攻，但被北朝鲜守备队击退。马立克说，美国在挑起冲突之后，它的部队随即进行直接的军事侵略。人人都知道美国的部队正在蹂躏朝鲜土地，人人都知道现在并不是朝鲜飞机前往轰炸像纽约之类的城市，而是美国飞机轰炸汉城和其他居民区，同时，美国军官尚无耻地以所投炸弹的吨数来夸耀。
    马立克称：在朝鲜冲突的准备工作中，麦克阿瑟所起的作用特别凶恶，他竭力想当亚洲的上帝和天皇，而不愿返回美国。
    马立克称：美国在朝鲜问题中，不仅无理地违犯了联合国宪章，而且还无耻地以友好的象征——联合国的旗帜来掩饰它的野蛮的侵略行动。
    联合国秘书长和美国代表团向联合国会员国家提出建议案时，企图掩饰这些议案的非法性质，它们是在安理会两个理事国——苏联与中国缺席时通过的。
    马立克在结语中强调指出：苏联代表团反对美国在使冲突“地方化”的假面具下力求扩大侵略的提案。马立克称：与此相反，苏联则力求和平解决，建议撤退外国军队，听取朝鲜冲突双方的申诉。
    安理会必须在苏联代表团所建议的和平之途及美国代表团所建议的旨在扩大侵略之途二者之中，选择其一。
    马立克演说结束之后，安理会即行休会，订于十四日举行下一次会议。
