　　A Letter from the Troops:
    Opinions on Three Comic Books
    Shao Tiancai
    Comic books are an effective tool for popularizing culture and raising the political awareness of the masses. Many have been published in the past year, and many people buy and read them. They have replaced the old society's children's books and have penetrated the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, the authors of comic books should strive to improve their works. We recently bought some and gave them to the company to read. They were very popular with the soldiers, which is a good phenomenon. However, everyone has some opinions to put forward about a few collections.
    (1) "The 19-Year-Old Company Commander" (published by Lighthouse Publishing House) - After reading this book, everyone said it was strange: the political instructor grew a beard. This is not the soldiers making a fuss; in fact, a political instructor with a beard cannot be found in the People's Liberation Army. In addition, some illiterate soldiers saw the little blacksmith in the book, and everyone shouted, "What is this little monk doing?" After literate people told them, they realized that he was a little blacksmith. In the fifty-fourth illustration, the iron that Li Lao Han is carrying and the one the soldier behind him is carrying are both illogical fantasies. Everyone thinks no one has that much strength. Especially in the ninth illustration, the soldiers looked at it and said: "How can these people be so stupid? They are sitting on the ground with their backpacks. None of us would do that."
    (2) "Bao Shan Joins the Army" (published by Education Publishing House) - Everyone looked at Liu Jinlian and Wang Xiaoxiang with their round buns and long braids and said, "Where are Liu Jinlian and Wang Xiaoxiang?" Because the characters in "Bao Shan Joins the Army" are familiar images in the army, they are new-type women in the liberated areas. They have strong and healthy bodies, and cheerful and lively personalities, and are by no means rural women from decades ago. The clothing of Wang Baoshan's father is also not the image of someone who toils and is forced to death by rent year after year. Everyone shook their heads and said, "With such attire, how could he be forced to death by rent? Is it not true?"
    (3) "Hero's Father" (published by Education Publishing House) - In the final handling, although it makes people have infinite admiration and respect for this heroic father, it is not very clever to let him also carry weapons and put on military uniform. At the same time, it is not something a regimental political director would do to casually agree to let a martyr's father, an old man of such an age, join the army. We should recognize that the hero's father has supreme glory in our society and will enjoy a lofty political status in society. If the picture is changed to end with him receiving respect from all aspects of our new society because of his new heroic deeds, the meaning would be better than ending it with him joining the army.
    The above three problems all reflect that the author's experience of mass life is not rich enough, or that he did not pay enough attention to it. A worker-peasant-soldier literary and artistic writer (including art workers) must have rich worker-peasant-soldier life experience in order to write or depict works that completely conform to worker-peasant-soldier life and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers well. Therefore, the author must earnestly, deeply, and realistically go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses to understand the masses, then his works will not make the masses feel strange.
    Editor's note: Comrade Shao Tiancai's letter was sent from Suiyuan. It reflects the collective opinions of comrades in the army on three comic books. We hope that readers will put forward more collective and active opinions like this. Such opinions are very valuable.

### 来自部队中的一封信：  对三本连环画的意见

　　来自部队中的一封信：
    对三本连环画的意见
    邵天才
    连环画是普及文化、提高群众政治认识的有效工具，一年来出版的不少，购买阅读的人也很多，它代替了旧社会小人书的地位，深入到广大的工农兵群众中去，因为这样，连环画的作者，应该力求提高他们的作品才好。我们最近买了一些，给连队阅读，很受战士们的欢迎，这是一种好现象。不过有几个集子大家有些意见提出来。
    （一）“十九岁的连长”（灯塔出版社出版）——大家看了这本书之后，都说真是奇怪：政治指导员长上了胡子。这不是战士们大惊小怪，事实上在解放军中留有胡子的政治指导员是找不到的。另外，有些不识字的战士们看到了该书中的小铁匠，大家都嚷着这个小和尚是干什么的，经过识字的人告诉以后才知道这是个小铁匠。书中五十四图里李老汉扛的那块铁和他后面的战士背的那一块，都是不合情理的幻想，大家以为谁也没有那么大的力气。特别是书中第九图，战士看了都说：这些人怎么这样的傻呢？他们背着背包坐在土地上面，我们谁也不会这样吧。
    （二）“宝山参军”（教育出版社出版）——大家看了刘金莲和王小香梳着圆髻和大辫子，都说这那里是刘金莲和王小香呢？因为“宝山参军”中的人物，都是部队中所熟悉的形象，是解放区的新型妇女，他们有坚实健康的身体，愉快活泼的性格，绝不是几十年前的乡村妇女了。王宝山父亲的服装也不是一个辛劳耕作、终年被地租逼的要死的形象。大家都摇着头说：“有这样的穿戴，怎么会被租子逼死了呢？不会是真的吧？”
    （三）“英雄的爸爸”（教育出版社）——在最后的处理上，固然使人对这英雄的爸爸有无限的景仰和尊敬，但是让他也背起武器，穿上军衣的处理是不大高明的。同时很轻率的答应一个烈士的父亲，上了偌大年纪的老人参军，也不是一个团政治主任会这样做的。我们应该认识到英雄的爸爸，在我们的社会里是有无上的光荣的，在社会上会享到崇高的政治地位的。如果把画面改为因为他的新英雄事迹而受到我们新社会的各方面尊敬而结束，意义要比让他参军来结束更好一些。
    以上三个问题都反映了作者对于群众生活体验不够丰富，或者是注意的不够。一个工农兵文艺作家（包括美术工作者），必须有了丰富的工农兵生活体验，才能写出或描绘出完全符合工农兵生活的作品，才能很好地为工农兵服务。因此作者必须认真地、深刻地、实事求是地到工农兵群众中去了解群众，那末他的作品便不会使群众感觉陌生了。
    编者按：邵天才同志这封信是从绥远寄来的。它反映了部队同志们对三本连环画的集体意见。我们希望读者们多提这样集体性和积极性的意见。这样的意见，是非常宝贵的。
