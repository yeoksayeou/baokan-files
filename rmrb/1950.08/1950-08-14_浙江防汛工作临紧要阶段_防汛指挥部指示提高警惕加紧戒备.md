Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 13th: Zhejiang Province's flood control work has entered a critical stage. According to hydrological and meteorological records over the years, the province is prone to torrential rains, typhoons, and high tides in August, September, and October. In particular, the province's rivers mostly flow directly into the sea, and heavy rains and mountain floods are often prevented from discharging by tidal backflow, leading to major disasters. In order to prevent floods and protect the autumn harvest, the Zhejiang Provincial Flood Control Headquarters issued another flood control circular on August 4, requiring flood control agencies at all levels to increase vigilance and strengthen the implementation of flood control work.

    防汛指挥部指示提高警惕加紧戒备
    【新华社上海十三日电】浙江省防汛工作已临紧要阶段。根据历年水文气象记载，八、九、十三个月内，该省随时都可能发生暴雨、台风和高潮的侵袭，特别是该省河流大都自流入海，往往因大雨山洪受潮水顶托不及宣泄而酿成巨灾。为预防水灾、保护秋收，浙江省防汛指挥部特于八月四日再次发布防汛通报，要求各级防汛机构，提高警惕，加强贯彻防汛工作。
