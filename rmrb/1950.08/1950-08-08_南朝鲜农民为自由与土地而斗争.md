South Korean Peasants Fight for Freedom and Land
Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Peasants Union, Xuan Qizhong

[This newspaper dispatch] On July 15th, Xuan Qizhong, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Peasants Union, published an article in the Pyongyang "Labor News" entitled "South Korean Peasants Fight for Freedom and Land," excerpts of which are as follows:

On July 4th, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea promulgated the "Decree on the Implementation of Land Reform in the Southern Half of the Republic."

According to this decree, the peasants in the southern half will be forever freed from feudal land relations and the tenancy system, liberated from all exploitation and oppression such as usury, forced grain requisitioning, and exorbitant taxes, and will henceforth be able to be truly free peasants.

The entire people of the liberated southern half warmly hailed and supported this decree and immediately began preparations for land reform.

On July 11th, the peasants of Ongjin County held a mobilization meeting in support of land reform, attended by more than 10,000 peasants, mostly with their entire families.

Peasant Zhang Shoutian from Songcheng Village said excitedly at the meeting: "I am in my forties this year and have always been a farmhand or tenant farmer. This is the first time in my life that I have felt so happy. To be given land for nothing... it's like a dream. I must contribute all my strength to ensure the victory of land reform and resolutely support the People's Army."

Previously, the Lee Seung-man gang implemented even more harsh land rents, grain requisitions, and more than forty kinds of taxes than during the Japanese rule, plunging the South Korean peasants into a living hell of hunger and cold. They forcibly seized the rice produced by the Korean peasants with their blood and sweat. From 1947 to 1948 alone, more than 11 million stones of rice were shipped to Japan. In 1950, rice worth US$2.9 million was also shipped to Japan.

The cultivated land area in the southern half is decreasing year by year. The cultivated land area in 1949 was 66% of the average from 1940 to 1944. As the cultivated land area decreases, the yield of agricultural products is also decreasing year by year. Therefore, the rural economy is increasingly in a state of bankruptcy.

The executioner American imperialists and their running dog Lee Seung-man vampires, because the peasants demanded land, opposed forced grain requisitioning, opposed the US imperialist policy of aggression and the Lee Seung-man gang's policy of national subjugation, have carried out large-scale massacres of peaceful peasants in the southern half, regardless of men, women, old or young. In their last struggles, in addition to suppressing them with bayonets, they also attempted to deceive the peasants under the guise of so-called "agricultural land reform." The so-called "agricultural land reform" is a completely anti-people method based on the principle of compensated purchase and compensated sale, thoroughly protecting the landlords and supporting their interests.

However, the South Korean peasants were not deceived by their appeasement schemes and have consistently carried out struggles.

The South Korean peasants' struggle for land and freedom has received the enthusiastic support of the entire people led by the working class, especially the North Korean peasants. The South Korean peasants' five years of struggle experience powerfully demonstrates that the landlords will not automatically give land to the peasants; only the peasants themselves can seize it from the landlords.

The South Korean peasants are able to implement the land reform they have long awaited today because they have a people's government that absolutely considers the interests of all the people. Therefore, all the peasants in the southern half, in order to consolidate the victory of land reform won with blood, are uniting tightly like iron around the Republic government and General Kim Il-sung, subordinating all their strength to the just war, and at the same time supporting the People's Army in all aspects, so as to thoroughly annihilate our enemies in the shortest possible time.

### 南朝鲜农民为自由与土地而斗争

　　南朝鲜农民为自由与土地而斗争
    北朝鲜农民同盟中央委员会副委员长  玄七钟
    【本报讯】北朝鲜农民同盟中央委员会副委员长玄七钟，于七月十五日，在平壤《劳动新闻》上著文，题为《南朝鲜农民为自由与土地而斗争》，节要如下：
    七月四日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会颁布了“关于在共和国南半部地区实行土地改革”的政令。
    依照这个政令，南半部农民永远摆脱封建的土地关系和佃租制度，从高利贷、强迫征粮及苛捐杂税等一切剥削和压迫下解放出来，从此能够做真正自由的农民了。
    解放后的南半部地区全体人民，热烈欢呼和拥护这一政令，立即展开土地改革的准备工作。
    七月十一日瓮津县农民召开了拥护土改动员大会，参加农民在一万人以上，大都是带领全体家属参加的。
    松城村农民张守天在会上兴奋地说：“我今年四十多，一向做着长工或雇农。生平第一次感觉到这样高兴。白给我土地……简直是作梦一样。我一定要把我所有的力量贡献出来，保障土地改革的胜利，并且要坚决支援人民军。”
    先前，李承晚匪帮实行比日本统治时代还更苛刻的地租、征粮及四十余种捐税，使南朝鲜农民落到饥寒交迫的活地狱里。他们把朝鲜农民用血汗造成的米谷强夺了去。单在一九四七年至一九四八年期间，输往日本的大米就在一千一百万石以上。一九五○年还有价值二、九○○万美元的大米输往日本。
    南半部耕地面积逐年在减少，一九四九年度耕地面积与一九四○—一九四四年平均数相比，减到百分之六六。随着耕地面积的减少，农产品收获量也在逐年降低。因此农村经济愈来愈陷于破产状态。
    刽子手美帝及其走狗李承晚吸血鬼们，因为农民要求土地、反对强迫征粮、反对美帝国主义侵略政策和李承晚匪帮的亡国政策的缘故，对于南半部和平农民不分男女老少，大规模的加以屠杀。它们在最后挣扎时期除了用枪尖镇压之外，还在所谓“农地改革”的幌子下，妄图欺瞒农民。所谓“农地改革”，是根据有偿收购、有偿卖售的原则，彻头彻尾保护地主拥护地主利益的反人民的办法。
    然而南朝鲜农民却没有被它们的怀柔阴谋所欺骗，一贯地进行着斗争。
    南朝鲜农民为土地和自由的斗争，是获得以工人阶级为领导的全体人民、特别是北朝鲜农民的热烈声援。南半部农民五年来的斗争经验，强而有力地说明着：地主不会把土地自动给与农民，只有农民自己从地主手中夺过来。
    南半部农民今日能够实行他们久所期待的土地改革，是因为有了绝对为全体人民利益着想的人民政权。因此南半部全体农民，为了巩固用血换来的土改的胜利，正铁一般地紧紧地团结在共和国政府和主席金日成将军的周围，将所有力量服从于正义的战争，同时从各方面支援人民军，要在最短期间内彻底歼灭我们的仇敌。
