　　Purchasing Surplus Grain from Farmers Reduces the Price Scissors
    Grain Prices in Jilin Rise Reasonably
    Farmers' Purchasing Power Relatively Increases; Sales of Industrial Products Expand
    [Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: Jilin Province, since early June, according to instructions from higher authorities, has launched a rural surplus grain purchasing campaign in various regions. Recently, this has led to a general and reasonable increase in grain prices in various places, increased sales of state-owned industrial products, and has caused urban-rural trade to begin to become smoother. At the beginning of the purchasing, due to insufficient attention to publicity and improvement of quality for farmers, and slightly higher purchasing standards, farmers busy with hoeing frequently had their grain returned due to not meeting the standards, resulting in only 3,200 tons purchased in the first half of June. It wasn't until early July, after the Ministry of Trade issued instructions to relax grain purchasing standards and increase the proportion of cash payments for grain, that the grain purchasing work began to develop relatively rapidly. In the first ten days of July alone, the province purchased nearly 4,000 tons. Adding the grain purchased in June, the province has purchased a total of more than 15,000 tons, of which 88 percent was purchased through cooperatives.
    During this period, in addition to receiving partial cash payments, grain and general merchandise companies in various regions prepared white flour, soybean oil, soybean cakes, salt, cloth, and various sundries for farmers to choose from according to their needs. In this way, the grain prices in various grain markets, which had been declining for months, began to rise, narrowing the price scissors between industrial and agricultural products, and were supported by the farmers. For example, in the grain-producing areas of the province, such as Jilin, Changchun, Dehui, Fuyu, Gongzhuling, and Panshi, as of July 10, compared to the beginning of June, the price of soybeans had increased by 700 to 1,700 yuan per jin (Northeast currency); sorghum and corn had increased by 300 to 700 yuan per jin. At the same time, the sales volume of state trading departments has also increased compared to the past. According to statistics from the provincial grain company, the sales volume of white flour, soybean oil, soybean cakes, salt, and other materials from grain companies in various regions of the province in June exceeded one and a half times that of May. General merchandise companies in various regions of the province also continuously transported state-owned industrial products to rural areas through grain purchasing. The total turnover of the province in June increased compared to the past. For example, a sales outlet of the Panshi General Merchandise Company in the grain-producing area had an average daily sales of 45 million yuan in early June, and after purchasing grain, the average daily sales has reached over 100 million yuan.

　　收购农民余粮缩小剪刀差
    吉林粮价合理上升
    农民购买力相对提高工业品销路扩大
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：吉林省自六月初即根据上级指示，在各地展开农村余粮收购工作，近已使各地粮价普遍合理上升，并增加了国营工业产品的销路，使城乡贸易开始走向通畅。在开始收购时，由于对农民宣传注意加工及提高质量做得不够，收购标准规定稍高，使忙于铲趟的农民在卖粮中多因质量不够标准而全部提回，致六月上半月只收购了三千二百吨。直到七月初，贸易部发下了放宽粮食收购标准、增加购粮现金比例的指示后，才使购粮工作比较迅速地开展起来。仅七月上旬，全省即购入近四千吨。加上六月里购入的粮食，全省共买进一万五千余吨。通过合作社购入的占百分之八十八。
    在此期间，卖粮农民除领取部分现金外，各地粮食、百货两公司都准备了白面、豆油、豆饼、食盐、布匹和各色杂货，使卖粮农民按照自已的需要选择实物。这样，数月来在各地粮食市场上不断下降的粮价开始上升，缩小了工、农业产品的剪刀差，受到农民的拥护。如省内产粮区的吉林、长春、德惠、扶余、公主岭、磐石等地，粮食价格到七月十日为止，与六月初比较，大豆每斤上涨了七百元到一千七百元（东北币，下同）；高粱与苞米每斤上涨了三百元到七百元。与此同时，国家贸易部门的销货数量也比过去增多了。据该省粮食公司统计：六月份省内各地粮食公司的白面、豆油、豆饼、食盐等物资的销售数量超过了五月份的一倍半，省内各地百货公司也因购粮而把国营工业产品不断地输送到农村里去，六月份全省总营业额比过去增加了。如产粮区的磐石百货公司的一个门市部在六月初每日平均销售额四千五百万元，购粮后到现在平均每天销售额达一亿元以上。
