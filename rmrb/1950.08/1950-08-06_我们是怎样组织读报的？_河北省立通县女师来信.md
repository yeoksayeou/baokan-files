Column: Newspaper Reading Group Experience

To the Editor:

Our newspaper reading group was established more than a month ago. We divided all faculty and staff into six groups according to their professional fields, with each group having one copy of the People's Daily. We adopted the method of "key outline, individual reading, group discussion, and regular testing" for reading the newspaper. Every day, the Academic Committee announces the important news of the day from the newspaper and distributes an outline of important documents to everyone for reference. Group members can read freely and hold current affairs talks when necessary. The Academic Committee also conducts monthly collective tests. This has corrected the superficial reading habits of general faculty and staff who only look at headlines and subheadings, and has made every comrade begin to pay attention to news reports on economic construction.

For students, due to funding constraints, we cannot subscribe to one copy for each class. Only the library subscribes to one copy of the People's Daily for students to read. Because there are many students and few newspapers, it is impossible to take turns reading. Therefore, we stipulate a certain amount of current affairs broadcasting time every day, using loudspeakers for representatives selected by each class to take turns reading the newspaper. Students can take notes with emphasis. However, students with low levels cannot take notes and feel that listening is not as good as seeing with their eyes. Based on the opinions reflected by the students, we changed our approach and the student union's study department published a "Daily Current Affairs" blackboard newspaper, which selectively published the important news of the day. After the "Daily Current Affairs" was published, many people read it. In the past month or so, the first news broadcast of the Central People's Broadcasting Station has been added. Because the news is early, everyone is very enthusiastic about listening. Judging from the results of the first current affairs test, the results of newspaper reading are generally very good. With the consent of the students in each class, we have persisted in this method of holding current affairs tests until the summer vacation. The students' enthusiasm for current affairs study has always been high.

### 我们是怎样组织读报的？  河北省立通县女师来信

　　我们是怎样组织读报的？  河北省立通县女师来信编者同志：
    我们的读报小组是在一个多月以前成立的。我们把全体教职员按业务性质分成六个小组，每小组有人民日报一份。读报时采用“重点提纲、个别阅读、集体讨论、定期测验”的办法。每天由学委会公布当天报纸的重要消息，并把重要文件的提纲发给大家，作为参考。小组成员可自由进行阅读，必要时则举行时事漫谈会。每月并由学委会出题举行集体测验。这样就纠正了一般教职员只看大标题小插题的粗枝大叶的读报方法，使每个同志开始重视了有关经济建设的新闻通讯报道。
    学生读报，因为经费关系，不能每班订一份。仅由图书馆订一份人民日报供同学阅览。同学人多报少，无法轮流阅读，便每天规定一定的时事广播时间，利用扩大器由各班同学选派代表轮流读报。同学可有重点地作笔记。可是程度低的同学没法，记不下来，感觉听不如用眼睛看。根据同学所反映的意见，我们便改变了办法，由学生会学习股出版“时事每日”黑板报一种，把每天重要消息择要发表。“时事每日”出版以后，看的人很多。最近一个多月，又增加了中央人民广播电台的第一次新闻。因为消息早，大家听得都很起劲。从第一次时事测验成绩看来，读报的成绩一般很好。这种举行时事测验的办法，我们取得各班同学的同意后，一直坚持到放暑假。同学们时事学习的热情，始终很高。
