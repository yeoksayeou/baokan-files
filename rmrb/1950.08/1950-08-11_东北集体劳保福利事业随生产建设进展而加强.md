Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: The collective labor insurance and welfare undertakings for workers in state-owned industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China are being strengthened with the progress of production and construction. This year, the area of workers' housing to be repaired and newly built is 1.44 million square meters; the construction area of workers' hospitals, canteens, cooperatives, clubs, etc., is more than 60,000 square meters. These construction works have now generally begun. The amount of repair and construction costs for workers' housing accounts for 13.5 percent of the total basic construction investment of the Ministry of Industry this year. After the completion of the workers' dormitory repair and new construction plan, including the past housing, more than 70 percent of all state-owned enterprise employees can live in state-owned housing. The medical equipment of state-owned enterprise employees now includes 52 hospitals, an increase of 12 over the end of last year, 454 clinics, an increase of 234 over the end of last year, and more than 6,600 medical personnel, an increase of more than 2,700 over the end of last year. In order to enable workers who are sick due to work-related injuries to recover their health as soon as possible and engage in production, some enterprises have also established workers' spare-time sanatoriums or convalescent homes. According to statistics, there are already 17 workers' spare-time sanatoriums and 24 sanatoriums in the entire region, where more than 1,500 workers suffering from work-related illnesses are recuperating. A total of 43 nurseries have been established by various enterprises, with more than 140 nannies caring for more than 1,000 babies of female workers. In addition, 259 workers who have lost their ability to work are being supported by the state in five nursing homes and three disability homes. In addition, many cooperatives, canteens, bathhouses, and clubs have been established by various enterprises. In the mines under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Coal Mining Administration alone, there are 74 cooperatives, 68 clubs, 130 canteens, and 440 bathhouses.
