　　Under the Impact of the Korean War and the Western European Peace Movement
    Internal Contradictions Within the Aggression Bloc Deepen
    Pravda Comments on the Current Situation of the North Atlantic Group
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 29th, dispatch from Moscow] TASS Moscow: Pravda's foreign affairs commentator, Vasilyev, commenting on the current state of the aggressive North Atlantic Group, stated: The most notable characteristic of the Atlantic Group's assistant foreign ministers' meeting, which began on August 22nd in London, is the increasing number of disputes among the countries of the aggression bloc, and the increasing pressure from the United States on its puppet states. American warmongers are extremely dissatisfied with the opinions of the governments of the Atlantic Group countries, who believe that the funds for rearmament should be provided by the United States. The United States has already allocated $4 billion to arm its Western European vassal states, but according to the new military plan, the military expenditures of Britain and France alone will amount to $15.2 billion. American imperialists are demanding that their Western European countries intensify the exploitation of the working masses in order to obtain the necessary funds. Western European factories should quickly switch to war production and immediately conscript as many new recruits as possible. But implementing these demands is not easy. Every working man and woman in Western European countries is increasingly seeing that the North Atlantic Treaty is synonymous with hunger, poverty, and ultimately war. This is why the people of Western Europe are increasingly determined to oppose the disastrous policies of the warmongers. The ruling cliques of the Marshallized countries believe that the only way out is to have American troops stationed in Western European countries. The ruling cliques, who handed over their countries to the ravages of the Hitlerite invaders during World War II, are now preparing to hand over these countries to the American invaders. Undoubtedly, the vassals' request for American troops to be stationed in Western European countries is being instigated from overseas. However, it is currently extremely difficult for American imperialism to agree to this request, because the United States does not have the divisions available to send to Europe. Troops are needed in Korea. This is also why the American ruling clique is increasingly emphasizing the establishment of a West German mercenary army (which is already being established in practice). All these facts indicate that, under the impact of the Korean events and the increasingly surging peace movement in Western Europe, the contradictions within the camp of the North Atlantic conspirators are growing and intensifying.

　　在朝鲜战争及西欧和平运动冲击下
    侵略集团内部矛盾日深
    真理报评论北大西洋集团现况
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报外交评论员华西列夫评侵略性的北大西洋集团的现况称：八月二十二日在伦敦开始的大西洋集团外长助理会议，其显著特点便是侵略集团各国间日益增多的争吵，以及美国对其仆从国家日益增加的压力。美国战争贩子们对大西洋集团各国政府的意见极表不满，后者认为重整军备的款项应由美国供给。美国已拨款四十亿美元武装其西欧附庸国，但是，根据新的军备计划，仅英、法两国的军费就要一百五十二亿美元。美国帝国主义者要求其西欧各国对劳动大众加紧剥削，以取得必要的款项。西欧的工厂应迅即转向战争生产，并立即征召尽可能多的新兵入伍。但是执行这些要求不是件容易的事。西欧各国的每一个劳动男女都日益看清：北大西洋公约就是饥饿、贫穷，最后就是战争。西欧的人民日益坚决地反对战争贩子们的灾难性政策，其原因就在于此。马歇尔化各国的统治集团认为，唯一的出路便是使美军驻扎西欧各国。第二次世界大战时，把国家拱手交给希特勒侵略者蹂躏的统治集团，现在又准备把这些国家拱手奉送给美国侵略者了。无疑地，仆从们要求美军驻扎西欧各国一节，是受到海外的鼓动的。但是，美国帝国主义目前却极难答应这一要求，因为美国没有可供派赴欧洲的师团。朝鲜需要军队。美国统治集团之所以日益重视建立西德雇佣军（实际上已经在建立了），其原因也就在这里。所有这些事实都指明：在朝鲜事件及西欧日益高涨的和平运动的冲击下，北大西洋共谋者阵营内部的矛盾，正在日益增长与尖锐化。
