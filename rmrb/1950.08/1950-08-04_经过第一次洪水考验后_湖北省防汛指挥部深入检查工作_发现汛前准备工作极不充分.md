　　After Undergoing the First Flood Test
    Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters Conducts In-Depth Inspection
    Discovering Extremely Inadequate Pre-Flood Preparations
    [Report from Hankou, this newspaper] Since late July, the water levels of the Yangtze and Han Rivers have receded successively. The flood control work in Hubei Province has undergone the test of the first flood. The provincial flood control headquarters has instructed various regions to seize the opportunity to conduct a general inspection and reinforcement of dikes, rectify flood control and rescue organizations, raise and adjust flood control materials, and quickly erect special telephone lines for flood control, to completely overcome the floods.
    In Hubei Province, the Yangtze and Han Rivers began to rise in late June and early July. By mid-July, the water levels in many areas along the two rivers had exceeded or approached the highest levels in previous years. Under the impact of the flood, a total of ninety-three incidents occurred on the main and branch dikes of the Yangtze and Han Rivers and the people’s embankments, including fifty incidents on the main dike of the Yangtze River, twenty-three incidents on the main dike of the Han River, and twenty incidents on branch dikes and people’s embankments. However, thanks to the all-out rescue efforts of the people along the two rivers, no serious floods occurred.
    The province's flood control preparations this year started earlier and the mobilization was more widespread. However, after this flood test, many serious shortcomings were still discovered. According to the inspection by the Provincial Flood Control Headquarters, the ideological mobilization for flood control in the province was not thorough enough, and generally speaking, the ideological mobilization was worse the further down it went. Many people had a sense of complacency, thinking that this year was a drought year, and planted crops on the outer slopes of the river dikes. Some people said, "This year the dikes are well-built, so they are safe." In terms of organizational preparation, below the district level, flood control organizations were only established in some areas before the water rose in early July. Some of the established county and district headquarters did not actually go to work on the ground. A considerable area had not organized rescue teams and dike patrol teams before the flood season. Special telephone lines for flood control were not fully erected (only 53 percent were completed by July 8). Flood control materials were not fully allocated. Inspection of dikes, backfilling ant nests and badger holes, and closing sluice gates were also not done well. Due to these reasons, many areas only mobilized and organized rescue forces temporarily when dangers occurred on the dikes, the telephones were not working, the command was ineffective, and they were in a flurry of activity, coping with the situation in a panic. These must be quickly overcome.
    However, during this flood control and rescue effort, thousands or even tens of thousands of people worked desperately for several days and nights in the sun or in storms. The commissioners of various special districts, the local Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party, and the responsible cadres of various counties and districts all went to the dikes successively to lead, supervise, and personally work with the masses to carry out rescue efforts. All of these are worthy of praise. In particular, when the water level at Yuekou on the Han River rose and several sections of the dike were in danger, a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army marched fifty miles in the rain that night to help with the rescue on the dike. After the Shashi Yangtze River dike was in danger, more than 2,000 male and female students from Jiangling Normal School and military and political cadre schools worked all night. When the Longwang Village breach occurred in Huangtan District, Yingcheng County, the cadres and the masses had lost confidence. The county head, Zhao Guangyuan, and the district head of the district personally went into the water to drive piles, leading the masses to actively rescue the situation. After two days and one night of rescue and blocking, the breach was finally blocked, reducing the flooding of more than 500 shi of fields.

　　经过第一次洪水考验后
    湖北省防汛指挥部深入检查工作
    发现汛前准备工作极不充分
    【本报汉口讯】七月下旬以来，江、汉水位已先后回落，湖北省的防汛工作已经过第一次洪水的考验。该省防汛指挥部已指示各地，抓紧时机进行普遍查堤加工，整顿防汛抢险组织，筹集和调整防汛器材，迅速架设防汛专用电话，以彻底战胜洪水。
    湖北境内长江、汉水在六月底、七月初开始水涨，到七月中旬，两河沿岸不少地区的水位即超过或接近历年最高水位。在洪水的冲击下，长江、汉水的干堤和支堤、民垸，共出险九十三处，计长江干堤五十处，汉水干堤二十三处，支堤、民垸二十处。但在两河沿岸人民全力抢护下，幸未发生严重水灾。
    该省今年防汛准备工作开始较早，动员也较普遍，但经过这次洪水考验后，仍然发现了不少严重缺点。据省防汛指挥部检查，该省防汛思想动员不够深入，一般说越往下思想动员越差。许多群众存在麻痹思想，认为今年是旱年，并在江堤外坡上种庄稼，有的群众说：“今年堤修的好，保险。”在组织准备方面，区以下的防汛组织，在七月初涨水前只有部分地区建立。已经建立的县区指挥部，也有的并没有实地到职办公。相当大的地区汛前仍未组织好抢险队、巡堤队。防汛专用的电话线，没有完全架通（到七月八日止，只完成了百分之五十三）。防汛器材没有完全调配好。检查堤防，翻填蚁穴獾洞，关闭闸门，也都没有作好。由于这些原因，不少地区在堤岸发生危险时，才临时动员和组织抢险力量，电话不通，指挥不灵，手忙脚乱，仓皇应战。这些都必须迅速克服。
    但在这次防汛抢险的时候，数千以至上万群众，在日晒或狂风暴雨中，连续几天几夜，拚命工作，各专区专员、中共地委、各县区负责干部，均先后上堤，领导督促并亲自与群众共同抢险，这都是值得表扬的。特别是在汉水岳口水位上涨，若干堤段发生危险时，第四野战军某部就在当夜冒雨行军五十里，赶往堤上帮助抢险。沙市江堤发生危险后，江陵师范和军政干部学校男女学生二千余人通霄工作。应城黄滩区龙王村决口，干部群众都已失去信心，该县县长赵光远与该区区长等亲自下水打桩，带动群众积极抢救，经过两天一夜的抢堵，终于堵住决口，减轻了五百多石田的水灾。（湖北省防汛指挥部秘书处）
