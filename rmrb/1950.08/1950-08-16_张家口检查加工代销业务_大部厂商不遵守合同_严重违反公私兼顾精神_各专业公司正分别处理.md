　　Zhangjiakou Inspects Processing and Sales on Commission
    Most Manufacturers Fail to Comply with Contracts
    Seriously Violating the Principle of Giving Consideration to Both Public and Private Interests; Various Specialized Companies Are Handling the Matters Separately
    [Report from our newspaper in Zhangjiakou] In order to understand the existing problems in the adjustment of public-private relations in Zhangjiakou City and to ensure the execution of contracts, the Zhangjiakou Municipal People's Government organized various state-owned specialized companies to inspect the processing and sales on commission businesses of their respective companies, and many problems have been discovered.

    In April, May, and June, the city's state-owned grain, general merchandise, petroleum, and other specialized companies established processing and sales on commission relationships with seventy private flour, rice and grain, grocery businesses, and street cooperative, and signed contracts separately. According to the results of this inspection of thirteen processing and sales on commission households and one street cooperative, most of them failed to comply with the contracts. Some reported fewer sales than actual, or reported more sales than actual; some privately used company materials, misappropriated sales proceeds for their own business operations; some received more raw materials than needed and failed to deliver goods on time; and the quality of finished products was substandard, etc. Dongxinghe, Tianyicheng, and other rice and flour shops reported fewer sales than actual or reported more sales than actual, totaling a shortage of 213 bags of flour, with each household short by two or three bags at a minimum, and fifty or sixty bags at a maximum. Among the flour processing and sales on commission households, except for Xinsheng and Yongfeng Machine Flour Mills, which were able to complete the delivery of flour on time, most of the others failed to deliver finished products on time, and the quality of finished products in each household was also mostly not up to standard, with excessive moisture content. Furthermore, in order to receive more raw materials, they overestimated their production capacity, resulting in their inability to complete the task by the deadline, leading to a large amount of stored grain unable to be processed into flour. For example, Yuanlong Flour Mill still has more than 3,300 bags in storage, and Ruifeng and Qingxingchang Flour Mills each have more than 1,800 bags in storage; among them, Qingxingchang Flour Mill is the most serious. This factory is short in paying the sales proceeds by 227,500 yuan, and uses the sales proceeds of 33.15 million yuan. Ruifeng Flour Mill also used 440 bags of flour produced after the signing of the contract to offset the previous debt to the company, resulting in a remaining debt of 440 bags by the end of July, equivalent to using 22.44 million yuan of the company's funds for its own turnover. After establishing a sales on commission relationship with the Petroleum Company, the private salt business Yutaixiang twice used 500,000 yuan of oil sales proceeds without turning them over to the company. The emergence of these bad phenomena shows that there is bureaucracy in the leadership of the specialized companies. They did not have sufficient understanding of the sales on commission households before signing the contracts, and they did not conduct timely and in-depth inspections after signing the contracts, resulting in losses to state property. On the other hand, it also shows that these private industrialists and businessmen are still attempting to seek illegal profits through speculation and trickery, seriously violating the fundamental spirit of giving consideration to both public and private interests. At present, in order to more effectively improve the processing and sales on commission business, in addition to ordering individual households to stop sales on commission, the remaining companies are strengthening education based on the principle of unity and transformation, hoping that they will earnestly correct their mistakes in the future to improve public-private relations.

　　张家口检查加工代销业务
    大部厂商不遵守合同
    严重违反公私兼顾精神  各专业公司正分别处理
    【本报张家口讯】张家口市人民政府为了了解目前张市调整公私关系中存在的问题与保证合同的执行，进一步调整工商业，曾组织各国营专业公司检查各该公司的加工、代销业务，已发现了不少问题。
    该市国营粮食、百货、石油等专业公司，曾在四、五、六月份与七十户私营面粉业、米面粮业、杂货业及市街区合作社等先后建立了加工、代销关系，并分别订立了合同。据这次对十三个加工、代销户及一个街合作社的检查结果，大部分均未能遵守合同，有的销多报少，或是销少报多，有的私自动用公司物资，挪用代销货款，周转自己营业，也有多领原料，不能按期交货，成品质量低劣等等。东兴和、天义成等米面铺销多报少或销少报多，共计差面粉二百一十三袋，每户所差少则二、三袋，多则五、六十袋。在面粉加工、代销户中，除欣生、永丰机面厂能按期完成交面外，其余大部均未做到按期交成品，且各户成品质量亦多不合规定，含水过多。且有为了多领原料，把生产能力估高，结果到期完不成任务，致大批存粮交不出面粉。如元隆粉厂至今尚存三千三百多袋，瑞丰、庆兴长粉厂各存一千八百多袋；其中较严重者为庆兴长粉厂。该厂少交代销款达二十二万七千五百元，动用货款达三千三百一十五万元。瑞丰粉厂也以订立合同后之面粉顶交前欠公司的四百四十袋，结果到七月底仍欠四百四十袋，等于动用公司货款二千二百四十四万元以供自己周转。私营盐业裕泰祥与石油公司建立代销关系后，曾两次动用代销油款五十万元不交公司。这些不良现象的产生，说明了专业公司在领导上存在着官僚主义，事前对代销户了解不够，订立合同后又未及时深入检查，致使国家财产受到损失。另一方面也说明了这些私营工商业者仍企图以投机取巧谋取非法利润，严重地违反了公私兼顾的基本精神。现各公司为更有效地改进加工、代销业务，除已令个别户停止代销外，其余均本团结改造的方针，加强教育，希望其在今后切实改正错误，以改善公私关系。（刘醒民）
