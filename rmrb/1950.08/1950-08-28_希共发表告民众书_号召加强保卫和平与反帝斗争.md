　　Greek Communist Party Issues Appeal to the People
    Calling for Strengthened Defense of Peace and Anti-Imperialist Struggle
    [Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 26th] TASS, Sofia, August 25th: The Free Greece Radio broadcast that leaflets from the Greek Communist Party have recently been secretly distributed in Thessaloniki, Drama, Thrace, and Kavala, urging the people to fight for bread, democratic freedom, and peace.
    The underground Peace Committee of Kavala issued an appeal to the people of the city and surrounding villages, calling on them to organize a peace movement and collect signatures for the Stockholm Appeal.
    The appeal calls on the people to establish peace committees in factories, streets, agencies, and villages, to resist American films and books that promote new wars, to fight for reducing the military to peacetime levels, for disbanding the royalist fascist forces and reducing military spending, for opposing the establishment of the "Athens-Belgrade" axis, and for preventing Greece from joining the imperialist aggressive blocs.
