　　"Heal the Wounded, Rescue the Dying, Practice Revolutionary Humanitarianism"
　　--Introduction to the National Health and Pharmaceutical Exhibition, Part 2
　　By our reporter Jin Feng
　　"Heal the Wounded, Rescue the Dying, Practice Revolutionary Humanitarianism," this is Chairman Mao's inscription standing in the military health service pavilion of the National Health and Pharmaceutical Exhibition, pointing out the direction of the People's Army's health work for more than twenty years.
　　The health work of the People's Army has developed along with the growth and expansion of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Since the birth of the Red Army on August 1, 1927, the health workers of the People's Army have always displayed a high degree of revolutionary spirit, rescuing the wounded on the front lines regardless of their own safety, and fighting alongside the soldiers. As early as the land revolution period, our army's health workers had established a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses. The exhibited pictures of health workers in the Jiangxi Soviet area going to the countryside to inject vaccinations for the villagers, and the villagers transporting and sheltering the wounded for the army, clearly point this out.
　　The arduous and extraordinary nature of health service work during the War of Resistance Against Japan was unprecedented. The models of mountain hospitals, underground hospitals, and bamboo hospitals on display are a microcosm of the work at that time. Here is a model of the Langya Mountain hospital in the Jin-Cha-Ji border region: on this side of the mountain, the famous squad leader Ma Baoquan led a squad to resist the attacking Japanese invaders all over the mountains, covering the retreat of the rear troops and the hospital; on the other side of the mountain, health workers scattered among the rocks and cliffs were carrying, lifting, and using ropes to hoist the wounded and sick to pre-arranged cliff sickrooms, cave sickrooms, and terraced field sickrooms; the villagers were turning the soil and hoeing the disguised terraced fields. Another model is the underground hospital in Wanxian, Hebei: there are more than forty interconnected caves underground, with operating rooms, medicine depots, wounded and sick caves, etc., and more than seventy people persisted inside. Above ground, the stoves, wells, and broken walls in the villagers' homes were all entrances to the caves, and the villagers sitting on the roof were acting as sentries, while the villagers grazing cattle were disguised health workers on patrol and treatment. These hundreds and thousands of mountain caves and underground caves were dug bit by bit with axes, chisels, hoes, and nail rakes by thousands of people in hundreds of sleepless nights; once the disguised health workers and sentry villagers were discovered by the enemy, they would be sacrificed under the bayonet. However, regardless of these things, our heroic health personnel, under the correct leadership of the Party, relied closely on the people and finally completed the arduous task of treating 300,000 wounded soldiers during the War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　The just war won the assistance of international justice fighters. The Chinese people will especially not forget Dr. Bethune, who traveled across the ocean and sacrificed himself on the anti-Japanese battlefield behind enemy lines in North China. When people see the first X-ray machine that Dr. Bethune brought from the United States to the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines for the Chinese people on the table, people cannot help but feel deep gratitude and remembrance. The Lugouqiao-style wooden box is also a model of Dr. Bethune's high technology combined with guerrilla warfare. The wooden box, loaded on two mules, can be disassembled in ten minutes into a fully equipped dressing room and pharmacy, and can be converted into an operating room in fifteen minutes. The great internationalist, Dr. Bethune, not only saved the lives of thousands of wounded soldiers in the War of Resistance Against Japan, but also made great contributions to the medical technology and organization of the Chinese People's Army.
　　With a high sense of responsibility, the health workers of the People's Army have been striving to improve their skills, overcome all difficulties, and do their best in battlefield rescue work to provide timely rescue and increase the rate of return to the team. Several huge models of battlefield rescue vividly illustrate several important stages of development in battlefield rescue work. In the battle of Huangtuling in 1939, in which Lieutenant General Abe, a Japanese chief, was killed, the company medics performed preliminary bandaging for the wounded one mile outside the firing line, while surgery was performed more than fifty miles away from the firing line; during the Hundred Regiments Offensive in 1940, the company had already bandaged wounds on the firing line. On the sand table depicting the Tianjin Campaign in 1948, white-clothed company medics were bandaging and setting bones for the wounded at the assault point, and the wounded could receive surgical treatment at our army's light artillery positions eight miles away from the enemy's firing line six hours after being injured. Therefore, during the War of Liberation, our army's health work not only completed the treatment of more than one million wounded soldiers, but also achieved a 75.8% cure and return to the team rate.
　　These achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the Party, the efforts of health workers, and the support of the people. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and the four years of the War of Liberation, not only did many combat heroes emerge on the front lines, but also many war rescue heroes who sacrificed themselves to save others and heroic martyrs emerged in the health department. As an example of the flesh-and-blood relationship between the army and the people in the base areas, there are the deeds of Rong Kouxue, the mother of soldiers who risked her life to rescue the wounded, and Cui Luotang, the eldest brother of the border area soldiers who begged for food to support the wounded. During the Anti-Japanese War, the villagers of Yechang Shigou Village in Wanxian gloriously died under the bloody swords of the Japanese invaders because they refused to reveal the hiding places of the wounded and sick of the Anti-Japanese People's Army. Their deeds will be immortal!
　　After the national victory, the army's health work was given top priority. Responsible comrades of the military region conducted in-depth inspections to focus on preventive health work in the troops. A widespread movement to improve nutrition, eliminate lice, and eliminate scabies was launched in the troops. The model of the Northeast Health Experimental Camp on display, as well as the pictures of the management, use, prevention and control of animal diseases, and the use of new-style horseshoes, vividly depict the epitome of building a strong national defense army.

　　“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”
    ——全国卫生医药展览会介绍之二
    本报记者  金凤
    “救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”，这是屹立在全国卫生医药展览会军队卫生勤务馆内的毛主席的亲笔题字，指出了二十多年来人民军队卫生工作的方向。
    人民军队的卫生工作是随着中国人民解放军的生长、壮大而发展起来的。一九二七年八月一日诞生了红军以后，人民军队的卫生工作者，一直发挥着高度的革命精神、奋不顾身地在火线上抢救伤员，与战士并肩作战。早在土地革命时期，我军卫生工作人员就与群众建立起了血肉相联的关系。展览着的江西苏区时代卫生工作人员下乡为老乡注射防疫针，以及老乡为军队转运和掩护伤员的图画，清清楚楚地指出了这一点。
    抗日战争时期卫生勤务工作的坚苦卓绝，是史无前例的。陈列着的山地医院、地下医院和竹子医院的模型就是当时工作的缩影。这里是晋察冀边区狼牙山山地医院的模型：在山的这一面，著名的班长马保全带领着一个班抗击着漫山遍野的进攻的日寇，掩护着后方部队和医院的撤退；在山的那一面，在山岩、悬崖间散布着的卫生工作人员，正在背着、抬着、用绳子吊着伤病员，藏到预先布置好的悬崖病室、山洞病室和梯田病室中去；老乡们则正在伪装的梯田上翻土锄地。另一个模型是河北完县的地下医院：地面下一共有四十多个相连的地洞，有手术室、药库、伤员洞等等，七十多个人在里面坚持着。地面上老乡家里的锅台下、水井旁、破墙下都是入洞口，屋顶上坐着的老乡正在放哨，放牛的老乡正是化装着来巡回治疗的卫生工作人员。这些数以千百计的山洞和地洞，是千万人在千百个不眠的夜里，用斧子、凿子、锄和钉钯一点点挖出来的；伪装的卫生工作人员和放哨的老百姓一被敌人发觉，是要牺牲在刺刀下的。然而，不管这些，我们英勇的卫生人员在党的正确领导下，紧紧倚靠着老百姓，终于完成抗日战争中治疗三十万伤员的艰巨任务。
    正义的战争博得了国际正义人士的援助。中国人民尤其不会忘记远渡重洋、牺牲在华北敌后战场上的白求恩大夫。当人们看到桌上的白求恩大夫从美国带来送给中国人民敌后抗日根据地的第一架Ｘ光镜时，人们不能不带着深深的感激与怀念。芦沟桥式木箱也是白求恩大夫的高度技术和游击战争结合的典范。装载在两匹驮骡上的木箱，十分钟就可以拆卸下来成为设备完整的换药室和司药房，十五分钟又可以改装为手术室。伟大的国际主义者白求恩大夫不仅救活了抗日战争中千百个伤病员，并且在中国人民军队的医疗技术和组织方面都有着极大的贡献。
    有着高度负责精神的人民军队的卫生工作人员，二十多年来都是努力提高技术，克服了一切困难，在战役救护工作上尽量做到及时救护和增加归队率。几个巨大的战役救护的模型生动地说明了战救工作的几个重要发展阶段。一九三九年黄土岭击毙日酋阿部中将之战，连队卫生员在火线外一里为伤员进行初步绑扎，进行手术则在火线五十里以外；一九四○年百团大战时，连队已在火线上裹伤。描绘着一九四八年天津战役的沙盘上，白衣的连队卫生员已在突击口上为伤员绑扎绷带和接骨，伤员在受伤六小时后就能在距离敌人火线八里的我军轻炮阵地得到手术治疗了。因此，在解放战争时期，我军卫生工作不仅完成了一百万以上的伤员治疗任务，而且达到百分之七十五点八的伤员治愈归队率。
    这些成绩是和党的领导、卫生工作人员的努力和人民的支援分不开的。八年抗日战争和四年解放战争中，不仅火线上出现了许多战斗英雄，同时在卫生部门也涌现了许多舍己救人的战救功臣和英勇牺牲的烈士。而作为根据地军民血肉相连的范例的是，冒着生命危险抢救伤员的子弟兵母亲戎寇秀和要饭来养活伤员的边区子弟兵大哥崔洛唐等优秀人物的事迹。抗日时期，完县野场石沟村农民为了不肯讲出抗日人民部队伤病员的隐藏地点，全村一百五十多人在日寇血腥屠刀下光荣就义的事迹，更是永垂不朽！
    全国胜利以后，部队卫生工作被提到了首要地位。军区负责同志深入检查以预防为主的部队卫生工作。部队中普遍开展了改善营养、灭虱、灭疥运动。展览着的东北卫生实验营的模型，以及军马的管理、使用、防治兽疫和新式蹄铁使用的图画，已鲜明地描绘出了建立一支兵强马壮的国防军的缩影。
