　　Be Vigilant Against Autumn Floods, Strengthen Defenses, and Strive for Final Victory Over the Floods!
　　Since the beginning of the flood season, rivers across the country have experienced successive rises in water levels, some exceeding the records of the flood periods of 1949 or 1931. For example, the Yongding River's fifth rise in water level saw a flow rate more than three times that of last year. The rainfall in the Huai River basin was not only greater and more concentrated than last year, but also exceeded the highest record of 1931. The main stream and tributaries of the Pearl River, some tributaries of the Yangtze River, and the Hun River and Taizi River in the Northeast all reached the same water levels as last year's flood peaks. Faced with such a severe flood situation, people in all regions have been conducting extensive struggles under the leadership of the flood prevention headquarters. Only in the Huai River basin, due to the evil consequences of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army breaching the dykes at Huayuan, the main stream and tributaries of the Huai River and the lakes along the river have become generally silted up, losing their storage and discharge capacity, resulting in an extremely severe flood disaster this year. In addition, although there have been local breaches in other areas, flood control work in general has achieved certain results, ensuring the safety of vast areas of farmland. The People's Liberation Army has also made great contributions in assisting with emergency rescue efforts.
　　As of now, although we have passed through a tense main flood prevention stage, there is still a month and a half before the end of the flood season. This is the final stage of flood prevention, and it is also a very crucial stage. Because climatically speaking, this period is still a time of relatively high summer and autumn rainfall, and the largest floods in various rivers are still very likely to occur at this time. For example, last year's flood season in the Yellow River was most dangerous from September 6 to October 7. The Liao River in Northeast China remained above the danger level from August 16 to September 4. Flood prevention for rivers in Hebei Province did not stop until early October. The largest floods of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers in 1931 also reached their peak from August 14 to 19, lasting until mid-September. Therefore, although half of the flood season has passed, no region, whether it has experienced flooding or not, can afford to be complacent or take chances, thereby relaxing its existing efforts. On the other hand, in terms of agricultural production, this period is also a valuable season for the grain filling and ripening of late autumn crops across the country. As long as we can persevere to the end and do our best, these thirty to fifty days of protection can guarantee the harvest of hundreds of millions of farmers for half a year, which will be a significant contribution to the national economy. Therefore, at this final juncture, river defense departments across the country must raise the highest alert, continue to organize forces, and wage a struggle to the end in order to strive for the final victory in flood prevention.
　　In order to learn from experience and improve our work, we put forward the following suggestions, hoping that all regions will pay attention to them:
　　First, raise vigilance and oppose complacency. For rivers that have not yet experienced major floods this year, such as the Yellow River and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it cannot be assumed that this year's floods can be passed by chance; it must be estimated that if a flood suddenly arrives, and the masses are not mentally prepared, and the new embankments have not been tested by major events, the degree of danger may be even greater. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to carry out mobilization and preparation work. Rivers that have already experienced several rises in water level this year cannot assume that the floods have passed and will not come again; it is necessary to continue to analyze the water situation, study the various changes in water flow and engineering conditions after the flood, and repair new and old dangerous works to prepare for another flood. According to the experience of flood prevention in the previous period, the reason for the breaches in many rivers was that during the intervals between floods, the embankments were not inspected, or after inspection, new dangerous works were discovered, but materials were not repaired and prepared in time, resulting in breaches and overflows when encountering floods again. These painful lessons must be deeply remembered. In some areas, the mass flood prevention organizations have also gradually become slack due to the floods having passed and being busy with other work, and leading organs at all levels must also pay attention to correcting this.
　　Second, according to the inspection report of the Ministry of Water Resources, the organization and deployment of flood prevention forces in various rivers is still weak in the areas where provinces, districts, and counties are interconnected. For example, although the Tongma Dyke on the Yangtze River has established a joint defense mechanism, it has only achieved segmented defense, and the understanding of unified leadership is still insufficient. Therefore, it is currently urgent to strengthen mutual assistance between upstream and downstream areas. Furthermore, during the three rises in water level of the Yongding River in Hebei Province, the Anci Flood Prevention Headquarters focused its attention on the rescue and protection of dangerous works on the dykes, and did not pay enough attention to the changes in the water situation at the old breach of Lianggezhuang in the junction area of Anci and Gu'an, which was also one of the main reasons for the breach in Nanhan. There are many similar examples in other provinces. It is hoped that all regions will seize the opportunity to solve the problems that already exist. For rivers with relatively complex relationships, special attention should be paid to the connection and mutual assistance between provinces, districts, and counties in the leadership of flood prevention.
　　Third, in areas where disasters have already occurred, in addition to actively carrying out drainage, the breaches that can be blocked should also be considered and blocked according to the situation in order to strive to minimize the affected area as much as possible. Blocking breaches during the flood season is a relatively difficult task, but as long as the engineering materials are fully prepared and the timing is appropriate, it is not impossible to do. For example, the recent project to block the old course of the Chaobai River, with a dam length of 150 meters, precisely selected the interval between floods and was closed and joined in four days. From then on, the water of the Chaobai River can no longer flow into the Jiyun River; the tens of thousands of acres of land flooded by the previous breach of the Jiyun River can be quickly dried up. This is a very good example.
　　All regions should emulate these experiences, continue to raise vigilance, and work hard to prevent floods.

### 警惕秋汛，加强防守，争取最后战胜洪水！

　　警惕秋汛，加强防守，争取最后战胜洪水！
    全国各地河流，自入汛期以来，先后涨水，有的超过了一九四九或一九三一年洪水期的纪录。如永定河第五次涨水，流量超过去年三倍以上，淮河流域雨量之大与降雨时间的集中，不但超过去年，并且超过一九三一年的最高纪录。珠江干流和支流，长江一部分支流，东北的浑河、太子河，洪峰都曾到达去年同样的水位。面对这样严重的水情，各地人民在防汛指挥部领导下，已经进行了广泛的斗争。只有淮河流域，因蒋匪在花园掘堤的恶果，使淮河干流和支流及沿河湖泊普遍淤高，失掉蓄泄效能，致今年造成极严重的水灾。此外，其他地区，虽然也有局部的溃决，但是一般防洪工作都有一定的成绩，保证了广大地区农田的安全。各地人民解放军协助抢险，也有很大贡献。
    截至目前为止，我们虽然已经度过一个紧张的主要防汛阶段，可是距离汛期的结束，还有一个半月的时间。这是防汛最后的阶段，也是十分紧要的阶段。因为就气候说，这一期间仍是夏秋雨量较多的时期，各河最大的洪水，还有很大可能会在这个时候发生。如去年黄河洪汛，便以九月六日至十月七日为最危险的时期。东北辽河，自八月十六日至九月四日，始终超过危险水位。河北各河的防汛，一直到十月初旬方行停止。长江淮河一九三一年的最大洪水，也是在八月十四至十九日达最高峰，持续到九月中旬。所以现在汛期虽然过去了一半，各地无论已否涨水，都还不容许有任何懈怠或存侥幸的心理，因而放松了现有的努力。另一方面，就农业生产来说，这一时期，也是全国晚秋作物灌浆育实的宝贵季节，只要我们能够坚持到底，善尽最后的努力，则这三十天至五十天的防护，便可保证亿万农民半年的收获，对国家经济将是一个重大的贡献。所以在这最后关头，全国各地河防机关，必须提起最高的警惕，继续组织力量，做坚持到底的斗争，以争取防汛的最后胜利。
    为了接受经验，改进工作，我们提出下列意见，希望各地加以注意：
    第一，是提高警惕，反对麻痹。今年还没有发生较大洪水的河道，如黄河和长江下游，还不能认为今年的洪水已可侥幸度过；必须估计万一洪水突然来到，群众没有精神准备，新堤没有经过重大考验，危险的程度可能更大。因此，还要继续进行动员准备的工作。今年已经经过几次涨水的河道，也不能认为洪水已过，便不会再来，必须继续分析水情，研究洪水过后水溜、工情的各种变化，修补新旧险工，以准备迎接再次的洪水。根据前一时期防汛的经验，许多河流决口的原因，是在洪水间歇期间，对于堤防没有进行检查，或者检查后发现新的险工，而没有及时整修和准备物料，以致再次遇到洪水即发生溃漫。这些惨痛教训，必须深刻记取。部分地区群众防汛组织，也有因为洪水已过，忙于别的工作，逐渐流于懈怠的情形，各级领导机关，亦须注意纠正。
    第二，根据中央水利部的检查报告，各河流防汛力量的组织运用，在省区县之间，互相衔接的地带，还是较弱的。如长江同马大堤，虽然建立了联防机构，但是只做到了分段防守，而对于统一领导，认识尚有不足。因此目前亟应加强上下游的联系互助。再如河北省永定河三次涨水，安次防汛指挥部集中注意于堤防险工的抢护，对于安次固安接合地带，梁各庄旧有口门的水势变化注意不够，也是造成南汉决口的主要原因之一。其他各省同类的事例尚多。希望各地对于已经存在的问题，要抓紧时机，加以解决。对于关系较为复杂的河道，在防汛的领导上要特别注意省区县之间的联系与互助。
    第三，已经发生灾害的地区，除应积极进行排水以外，对于可以堵复的决口，也应斟酌情势，相机堵复，以争取尽量缩小受灾面积。汛期堵口是比较困难的事情，但是只要工料准备齐全，时间选择适宜，并非不可能办到的。如最近潮白河旧道堵塞工程，坝长一百五十公尺，恰好选择了洪水间歇的期间，四天内便堵闭合龙。从此潮白河水可以不再流入蓟运河；蓟运河上次决口被淹十几万亩土地可以迅速涸复。这便是一个很好的例证。
    各地应仿效这些经验，继续提高警惕，努力防汛。
