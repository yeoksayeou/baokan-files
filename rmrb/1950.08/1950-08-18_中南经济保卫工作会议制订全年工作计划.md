Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th. In order to better conduct economic security work in the Central-South region, the Public Security Department and the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central-South Military and Political Committee jointly convened the Central-South Economic Security Conference from the 21st of last month to the 2nd of this month. Deng Zihui, Vice Chairman of the Central-South Military and Political Committee, delivered a report on economic security work at the meeting. Based on the spirit of the National Economic Security Conference and the characteristics of the Central-South region, the meeting discussed the situation of economic security work in the Central-South region and formulated annual work tasks and work plans.

In the past year, the economic security work in the Central-South region has been successful, with dozens of special agent sabotage cases solved; economic security organizations in various factories, mines, and enterprises have been established one after another; and a number of outstanding model workers have emerged in road protection, factory protection, and mine protection work, effectively protecting the safety and production order of industrial and mining enterprises. However, American imperialism and its running dog, the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang, continue to send and instruct special agents to carry out various economic sabotage activities. According to incomplete statistics: of the accidents that occurred in industrial and mining enterprises in the entire region in the past six months, politically motivated sabotage incidents accounted for 30 percent. This illustrates the importance of economic security work.

Bu Shengguang, Minister of Public Security of the Central-South Region, said in his concluding report at the meeting: The hidden struggle on the economic front is complex and long-term. He called on economic work cadres and economic security work cadres to attach importance to economic security work politically, ideologically, and organizationally, and to resolutely guard against lax management and complacency.

　　中南经济保卫工作会议制订全年工作计划
    【新华社汉口十五日电】为了更好地做好中南区的经济保卫工作，中南军政委员会公安部和财政经济委员会联合于上月二十一日至本月二日召开了中南经济保卫会议。中南军政委员会副主席邓子恢在会上作了关于经济保卫工作的报告。会议根据全国经济保卫会议的精神和中南地区的特点，讨论了中南区经济保卫工作的情况，制订了全年的工作任务和工作计划。
    一年来，中南区的经济保卫工作是有成绩的，共破获了特务破坏案件数十起；各工厂、矿山及企业单位中的经济保卫机构已次第建立；在护路、护厂、护矿工作中，并出现了一批优秀的模范工作者，有力地保护了工矿企业的安全和生产秩序。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗国民党残余匪帮仍不断地派遣和指使特务分子进行各种经济破坏活动。据不完全统计：全区半年来在工矿企业发生的事故中，带有政治性的破坏事件即占百分之三十。这就说明经济保卫工作的重要。
    中南区公安部部长卜盛光在会议的总结报告中说：经济战线的隐蔽斗争是复杂的和长期的。他号召经济工作干部和经济保卫工作干部要从政治上、思想上、组织上重视经济保卫工作，力戒管理松懈和麻痹大意。
