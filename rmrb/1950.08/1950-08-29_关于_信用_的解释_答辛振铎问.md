Explanation of "Credit"
    Answering Xin Zhenduo's Question

To the Editors:

    In your newspaper's editorial "New Direction of the Banking Industry" on August 24th, the fifth paragraph, lines 26-30 state: "The state bank should establish extensive business ties with private banks and firms. In business, the state bank should assist private banks and firms in allocating funds, conducting remittances, and facilitating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas; when credit experiences stagnation, it can adopt the method of re-deposits to help private banks and firms overcome difficulties." Does the word "credit" refer to individual firms, or to a broad, social, and general industrial and commercial credit? Please provide an answer.

Editor's Reply: In this newspaper's August 24th editorial, "New Direction of the Banking Industry," the section "…when credit experiences stagnation, it can adopt the method of re-deposits to help private banks and firms overcome difficulties…" the word "credit" refers to a general social credit stagnation. For example, during March and April of this year, due to the cessation of false purchasing power caused by long-term inflation, industry and commerce generally encountered difficulties in product sales, forming a social credit stagnation. The state bank can adopt the method of re-deposits to help private banks and firms overcome difficulties. If an individual firm experiences credit stagnation due to certain reasons, such as excessively high lending conditions that are unacceptable to general industry and commerce, it can also deposit its funds in the state bank, but this will only be treated as a general deposit.

　　关于“信用”的解释
    答辛振铎问编者同志：
    贵报八月二十四日社论《银钱业的新方向》一文中，第五段第二十六行至三十行“国家银行对私营行庄应建立广泛的业务联系。在业务上，国家银行应协助私营行庄调拨资金，开展汇兑，便利城乡物资交流；遇到信用发生迟滞的时候，可以采取转存款的方式，帮助私营行庄克服困难。”其中“信用”两个字是指行庄个体而言呢？还是指广泛的、社会性的、一般工商业的信用而言呢？请予以解答。 辛振铎
    编者答复：本报八月二十四日社论《银钱业的新方向》一文中“……遇到信用发生迟滞的时候，可以采取转存款的方式，帮助私营行庄克服困难……”一节中的“信用”两个字，是指一般社会性的信用迟滞而言。如在今年三四月间，因长期通货膨胀所造成的虚假购买力的停止，工商业普遍遇到产品滞销的困难，形成社会信用迟滞，国家银行可以采取转存款的方式，帮助私营行庄克服困难。如果个别行庄因某种原因，如放款条件过高，不能为一般工商业所接受而造成的信用迟滞，它也可以将存款存在国家银行，但只能当作一般存款看待。
