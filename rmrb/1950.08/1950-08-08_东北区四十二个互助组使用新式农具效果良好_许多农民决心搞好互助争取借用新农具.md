　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd. Under the guidance of technical personnel dispatched by the People's Government, forty-two farmer mutual aid teams in the Northeast, after experimenting with eight kinds of agricultural tools such as Soviet seeders during the spring plowing, have widely used Soviet-made flat-blade weeding machines for weeding in the summer hoeing, and have achieved preliminary results. The efficiency of this kind of agricultural tool is generally higher than that of the improved summer hoeing tools promoted locally. For example, the "Joint No. 1 Shovel Harrowing Machine," the most efficient of the improved agricultural tools promoted this year, can weed 15 to 20 mu per day; while the Wang Zhijian mutual aid team in Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, used two Soviet-style new weeding machines and weeded more than 90 mu of wheat fields in two days, averaging nearly 25 mu per day per machine. Because this kind of agricultural tool has the characteristic of "using more animal power and less human power," it has changed the past situation of "busy people and idle horses" in summer hoeing, thus relatively reducing human labor and allowing extra strength to be drawn out for further intensive cultivation. In previous years, the Liu Bingli and He Fengshan mutual aid teams in Hejia Village, Yushu County, Jilin Province, had to hire more than 100 workers to complete three rounds of weeding and soil cultivation. This year, due to the use of four Soviet agricultural tools for weeding, not a single worker was hired, and one more hoeing was done, while the result of summer hoeing was advanced by ten days. The Sun Shaoyan mutual aid team in Shulan County used new agricultural tools for weeding, and the efficiency was four times higher than that of the local old agricultural tools. The team's more than 90 mu of land has completed four rounds of weeding and five rounds of soil cultivation ahead of schedule. The Sun Yonghe mutual aid team in Taian County, Heilongjiang Province, hoed wheat once and soybeans twice last year, but this year both have been doubled. The crops sown and weeded with Soviet mechanical agricultural tools in various places are growing strong, and wheat has been harvested ahead of schedule.
　　The trial use of Soviet mechanical agricultural tools in various places has aroused widespread envy and praise from farmers. Whenever such agricultural tools appear in the fields, people go to visit them in groups. Since the Sun Shaoyan mutual aid team in Shulan County, Jilin Province, began to try out new agricultural tools in the spring plowing season, more than 1,000 farmers from various places have visited. Many farmers said that they must organize the mutual aid team well next year and strive to borrow new agricultural tools.

　　东北区四十二个互助组使用新式农具效果良好
    许多农民决心搞好互助争取借用新农具
    【新华社沈阳三日电】东北四十二个农民互助组在人民政府派出的技术人员指导下，继春耕时试用苏联播种机等八种农具后，在夏锄中又普遍使用了苏联马拉平作锄草器锄草，并获得初步的成效。这种农具一般效率比当地推广的夏锄改良农具还高。例如今年推广的改良农具中效率最高的“联合号铲趟机”，每天能锄草十五亩至二十亩；而黑龙江省讷河县王治俭互助组使用两台苏联新式锄草机，两天内即锄完九十余亩麦田的杂草，平均每台每日锄草近二十五亩。由于这种农具具有“多用畜力少用人力”的特点，改变了过去农民在夏锄中“人忙马闲”的情况，因而使人力劳动相对减少，得以抽出多余力量进一步从事精耕细作。吉林省榆树县何家村刘秉礼、何凤山两互助组，往年夏锄必需雇一百多个工，才能完成三遍锄草培土工作。今年因使用了四台苏联农具锄草，结果一工未雇，并多铲一遍，而夏锄的结果却提前了十天。舒兰县孙绍岩互助组用新农具锄草，效率较当地旧农具提高四倍，该组九十余亩地已提前完成四遍锄草及五遍培土。黑龙江省泰安县农民孙永和互助组去年小麦铲了一遍，大豆铲了两遍，今年则均增加一倍。各地使用苏联农具播种和锄草的庄稼都长得肥壮，小麦并已提前收割。
    苏联机械农具在各地的试用，引起了农民的普遍羡慕和赞扬。每逢此种农具出现在田野时，人们均成群结队前往参观。吉林省舒兰县孙绍岩互助组自春耕开始试用新式农具以来，前往参观的各地农民已达一千人以上。许多农民表示明年一定要把互助组组织好，争取借用新式农具。
