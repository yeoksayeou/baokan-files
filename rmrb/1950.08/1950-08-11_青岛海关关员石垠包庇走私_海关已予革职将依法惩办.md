　　Qingdao Customs Officer Shi Yin Shelters Smuggling
    Customs Has Dismissed Him and Will Punish Him According to Law
    [Our Newspaper] Qingdao Customs recently had a case of customs officers colluding with sailors to shelter smuggling and embezzlement. Shi Yin, a third-class customs officer of the Customs, colluded with the crew of the "Haihou" ship during his return trip from Hong Kong to Qingdao in May, engaging in smuggling and malfeasance together. On July 14, when the "Haihou" ship arrived in Qingdao, Shi Yin again used his power to conspire with the crew to directly escort smuggled goods, taking 279 penicillin ampoules and 30 watches from the ship, and sending 300 silver dollars to the ship. Another 544 silver dollars were found and confiscated at his home before they could be sent away. Shi Yin has confessed to the smuggling. In addition to dismissing Shi Yin and transferring him to the judicial authorities for sentencing according to law, the Qingdao Customs authorities are also preparing to use the facts of this case to educate all customs cadres, in order to thoroughly eliminate the corruption left over from the old customs.

　　青岛海关关员石垠包庇走私
    海关已予革职将依法惩办
    【本报讯】青岛海关最近发生了一件关员勾结船员包庇走私贪污案件。该关三等关员石垠，在今年五月间自香港返青途中，即曾勾结“海后”轮船船员，合伙走私舞弊。七月十四日，“海后”轮到达青岛，石垠又利用职权，与船员合谋直接护送走私，自船上带下私货盘尼西林二七九支，手表三十只，并送上轮船银元三百枚，另有五四四枚放置家中，未待送走即被发觉扣押。石垠已供认走私事实。青岛海关当局除将石垠革职移送司法机关依法判罪外，并准备以此案事实教育海关全体干部，以彻底肃清由旧海关遗留下来的贪污现象。
