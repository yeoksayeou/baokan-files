　　Serious Tax Evasion on Goods in Shanghai
    Municipal Tax Bureau Relies on Staff and Masses to Eliminate Tax Evasion, Seizing More Than Six Thousand Cases in Half a Year.
    [Shanghai News] According to the Liberation Daily: The Shanghai Municipal Tax Bureau has organized most of its personnel, relying on the broad masses of workers and the assistance of legitimate industrialists and merchants, to actively carry out the work of investigating and cracking down on tax evasion on goods. According to statistics: In the past six months, the total number of cases seized reached 6,644, with supplementary tax amounts of 10 billion, 1.699 million yuan, and fines of 680.24 million yuan.
    The above figures show that although the collection of goods tax has achieved great success in the past six months, the phenomenon of tax evasion is still quite serious. There are many tricks for tax evasion. Some use false evidence to evade taxes. For example, Xin Sheng Tobacco Factory purchased 25,000 forged inspection certificates, affixed them to the goods, and transported them out of the factory, and reused the already affixed inspection certificates; another example is that Xie Tai Sugar Firm actually modified and obtained old packaging skins that had been stamped; Yongxin Raincoat Factory once evaded about 300 million yuan of private goods by using tax certificates. Some do not register inventory in an attempt to evade taxes. For example, Xincheng Chemical Factory was found to have 37 kinds of untaxed pigments; Dafeng and Jinxing Chemical Factories were also found to have 40 kinds of untaxed goods. There are also those who privately brew liquor or put local liquor into kerosene cans for smuggling and sales. In addition, a small number of handmade cigarette organizations also have tax evasion behaviors. Some manufacturers deliberately report the sale of raw materials as raw materials for their own use in an attempt to evade taxes.
    Among the more than 6,600 cases seized, those discovered through secret reports accounted for more than 60%, which shows that the broad masses of people are very concerned about and cherish today's taxes, and also shows that the great significance of taxation in stabilizing prices and supporting the war has been recognized by the broad masses of people. The efforts of tax officials to implement policies and complete tasks are also equally successful.
    The handling of the above tax evasion cases generally adopts a cautious attitude, grasping the principle that education is more important than punishment. Except for the confiscation of a very small number of goods, most of them are given education to pay supplementary taxes in accordance with regulations or are given a small fine. This has achieved the dual effect of investigation and education. At the same time, different treatment methods are also adopted. Those manufacturers who intentionally speculate and evade taxes, are cunning and procrastinate, and attempt to escape punishment will never be tolerated. Once discovered, in addition to paying supplementary taxes, they will also be fined. For example, Shengji Yuqingyong Hotel cleverly evaded taxes and failed to report a total of 4,247 catties of wine. After being discovered, the principle of leniency was adopted to order it to pay supplementary taxes within a time limit; however, the owner of the hotel took an inch and deliberately delayed payment, actually intentionally resisting taxes, and was sent to the court for handling. In addition to paying supplementary taxes, a fine of 3 million yuan was imposed.
    From the above facts of tax evasion, it seems that eliminating tax evasion is still the basic key to doing a good job in tax collection in the future.

　　沪市货物税逃漏严重
    市税局依靠职工群众，杜绝偷漏税，半年来缉获案件六千余起。
    【上海讯】据解放日报消息：上海市税务局曾组织了大部分人员，依靠广大职工群众，与正当工商业者的协助，积极开展了缉查偷漏货物税的工作。据统计：半年来缉获案件总数达六千六百四十四起，补税金额一百亿零一千六百九十九万余元，罚款六亿八千零二十四万余元。
    上述数字说明了半年来货物税征收工作，虽然有很大成绩，但漏税现象仍然相当严重。偷漏税花样繁多，有的利用伪证等方式逃税，如新升烟厂购入伪造查验证二万五千枚，贴在货上运出厂外，并将已贴用之查验证揭下重用；又如协泰糖行竟改装套取已贴过印照之旧包皮；永新雨衣厂曾套用税照偷漏约三亿元的私货。有的不登记存货企图逃税，如信成化工厂即被查出未税颜料达三十七种；大丰、金星两化工厂亦查出未税货品四十种。还有的私酿烧酒或将土酒装入火油听内，偷漏运销。此外，有少数手工卷烟组织亦有偷税行为。还有的厂商将出售原料故意报为自用原料，企图逃税。
    在缉获的六千六百多件案件中，密报查获的就占百分之六十以上，这说明了广大人民对今天的税收是很关心爱护的，也说明税收对稳定物价、支援战争的重大意义已为广大人民所认识。而税收人员的努力执行政策，完成任务，也同样具有成绩。
    对以上逃税、漏税案件的处理，一般是采取慎重的态度，掌握了教育重于处罚的原则，除没收极少部分货物外，绝大部分是施以教育令其照章补税或处以少许罚款。这样就获得了查缉与教育的双重效果。同时，也采取了分别对待的方法，对个别有意投机逃税、狡猾多端、拖延时日、企图幸免的厂商，则决不姑宽，一经查获，除补税外，还要加罚。如生记裕庆永酒店取巧逃税、漏报酒共计四千二百四十七斤，经查获后，本宽大方针着其补税，限期缴纳；但该店老板竟得寸进尺，有意拖延不缴，实际是有意抗税，送经法院处理，除补税外，罚款三百万元。
    从以上逃税漏税事实看来，杜绝逃税、漏税仍是今后做好税收工作的基本关键。
