　　Tax Questions and Answers
    Question: Originally a coarse grain merchant and already obtained a merchant business license, now wants to transfer to a formal grain business, is this permissible?
    Answer: Should apply for a business license for a sedentary merchant from the Commercial Bureau.
    Question: The goods that the business firm sells on credit to farmers are recorded in a detailed ledger, and business tax is paid based on the sales amount. When farmers repay the debt with grain, the business firm sells the grain. Is this batch of grain still considered part of the business turnover? Is business tax still levied when taxing?
    Answer: Business tax is a type of behavior tax. Anyone who engages in business activities should be subject to business tax. The business firm selling goods to farmers on credit is a business activity and should be subject to business tax. The business firm selling the grain given by farmers in repayment is also a business activity, so it should also be counted as turnover and business tax should be levied accordingly.
    Question: The Government Administration Council's notification states that, starting from July 1st, adjustments will be made to the Category A direct tax portion of national taxes: "Sedentary merchants who go to other places to sell goods and hold a certificate from the local tax bureau may pay taxes at the sedentary merchant tax rate in the place of sale." I am an employee of a flour mill from another province, stationed in Beijing to promote our factory's flour. I hold a certificate and am also selling our own products directly, not selling to merchants. Can I pay taxes at the local Beijing flour mill rate of one percent?
    Answer: If an out-of-province flour mill, holding a certificate, promotes its own produced flour in Beijing, and its selling price minus necessary expenses (freight, etc.) only includes manufacturing profit, its business tax will be calculated at the flour manufacturing tax rate of one percent. If it is higher than the original factory's selling price and already includes commercial profit, it should be calculated at the rice and flour commercial tax rate of two percent.

　　税务问答
    问：原是杂粮行商，已领行商营业许可证，现欲转正式粮食座商，不悉是否许可？
    答：应向商业局申请座商营业执照。
    问：商号赊给农民的货物，写了流水账，算上营养额，纳了营业税。农民还账时给的是粮食，商号把粮食卖了，这批粮食还再算营业流水吗？征税时还征营业税吗？
    答：营业税是一种行为税，凡有营业行为者，即应课征营业税。商号赊给农民货物是营业行为，应课征营业税。商号把农民还账时所给的粮食卖了亦是营业行为，故亦应算流水，照征营业税。
    问：政务院通知自七月一日起调整全国税收甲项直接税部分：“座商赴外埠销货，持有本市税局证明者，可按座商税率向销地纳税”。我是外埠一个制粉厂的职员，驻京推销本厂面粉，持有证明，亦是自产自销，并未卖给商人，是否可按北京市当地粉厂百分之一纳税？
    答：外埠制粉厂，持有证明，驻京推销自产面粉，其售价减去必要费用（运费等）后如只有制造利润者，其营业税按面粉制造业税率百分之一计征。如高于原厂出售价，已有商业利润者，应照米面商业税率百分之二计征。
