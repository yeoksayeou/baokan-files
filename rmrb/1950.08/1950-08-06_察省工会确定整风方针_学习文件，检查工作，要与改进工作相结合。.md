　　[Zhangjiakou News from our newspaper] The Chahar Provincial Federation of Trade Unions held a committee meeting on July 24th, and determined that "focusing on the central task of the production competition movement, combined with implementing the spirit of the Trade Union Law, to inspect various tasks, rectify work style, improve leadership, and formulate practical work methods" would serve as the rectification policy for trade union work in Chahar Province.

　　The meeting first discussed the trade union work in Chahar Province over the past year, and believed that there were still serious bureaucratic work styles and unorganized, undisciplined phenomena in the leadership of provincial, municipal, and special district trade unions. Many trade unions did not discuss administrative production plans, did not study the thoughts and demands of workers, and did not lead workshops and groups to formulate plans and hold production meetings. Some trade unions did not pay enough attention to the problem of relieving unemployed workers, and were not concerned enough about workers' lives and the implementation of labor protection policies. For example, the workers' dormitories in some important factories and mines were so rudimentary that they were uninhabitable, and the trade unions did not suggest some possible improvements to the administration; the necessary work clothes that had been used for many years in several factories and mines were abolished, and they did not express their attitude. In grassroots trade unions, a lot of work was handled by a few people, without democratic discussion. For example, the workers' representative meeting of the Mechanical and Electrical Factory has only been held once since its establishment in July last year. The issue of developing production competitions in private enterprises has not been resolved for a long time. The responsibilities of the Party, the government, and the trade union were confused. In some factories and mines, the Party and the government led the mass production competition, and the trade union did not actively seek solutions. In terms of being unorganized and undisciplined, the main manifestation was the failure to implement the resolutions and instructions of higher authorities. For example, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions failed to earnestly implement the reporting system stipulated by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; many trade unions lacked strict work systems, did not act in accordance with regulations, did not hold executive committee meetings for a long time, and did not seriously collect membership dues; some trade union cadres were not settled in their work, their attitude was abnormal, and there was much work that could have been done well that was not.

　　Therefore, the meeting decided to first study the rectification documents designated by the Provincial Party Committee, study the Trade Union Law, etc., conduct extensive and in-depth work inspections, and require that the study of documents, inspection of work, and improvement of work be combined, so as to: 1. Establish and improve all department work and various work systems, strictly enforce work attitudes, and establish a responsibility system. 2. Strengthen the work of grassroots trade unions and workshop groups. 3. Overcome the tendency of closed-doorism towards technical personnel and staff, carry out rationalization proposals, improve technology, and overcome the phenomenon of neglecting one thing while attending to another between quality, quantity, machinery, and employees in the production competition movement. 4. Assist the administration in improving mine safety and health work, and strengthen labor discipline. 5. Further coordinate labor-capital relations, and lead and organize workers in private enterprises to work hard in production.

　　The meeting also determined that the focus of this rectification should be on the province, city, and special districts, focusing on solving the problems of leadership style and leadership methods. It also emphasized that leading cadres should first make a deep self-criticism, so as to inspire lower-level trade unions to make criticisms and examine themselves.

　　The rectification movement of trade union cadres in Chahar Province will end at the end of September.

　　察省工会确定整风方针
    学习文件，检查工作，要与改进工作相结合。
    【本报张家口讯】察哈尔省总工会于七月二十四日召开委员会，确定以“围绕生产竞赛运动的中心任务，结合贯彻工会法的精神，来检查各项工作，整顿作风，改进领导，并制订切合实际的工作办法”，作为察省工会工作的整顿方针。
    会议首先讨论了察省一年来的工会工作，认为在省、市、专区工会的领导方面还存在着严重的官僚主义作风和无组织无纪律的现象。许多工会不讨论行政生产计划，不研究工人的思想和要求，不领导车间与小组订计划与开生产会议。有些工会对救济失业工人问题重视不够，对工人生活问题和执行劳保政策不够关心。如某些重要厂矿工人宿舍简陋到不能住人的程度，工会也没有建议行政作某些可能的改进；若干厂矿中多年沿袭下来的、必需的工作服被取消了，也不表示态度。在基层工会中不少工作由少数人包办，不经过民主讨论。例如机电厂工人代表会从去年七月成立到现在只开过一次会。私营企业开展生产竞赛问题，长期未得解决。党、政、工的职责混淆，有的厂矿都是由党、政领导群众生产竞赛，工会也未主动寻求解决。在无组织无纪律方面，主要表现在对上级的决议和指示未能贯彻，如省工会未能认真执行全国总工会规定的请示报告制度；许多工会缺乏严密的工作制度，不按规章办事，长期不开执委会，不认真征收会费；有些工会干部不安心工作，态度不正常，能作好的工作有许多没有作好。
    因此，会议决定首先学习省委指定的整风文件，学习工会法等，进行广泛深入地工作检查，并要求把学习文件、检查工作和改进工作结合起来，做到：一、建立与健全全部门工作与各种工作制度，严肃工作态度，树立责任制。二、加强基层工会与车间小组工作。三、克服对技术人员与职员的关门主义的偏向，开展合理化建议，提高技术，克服生产竞赛运动中质、量、机器、职工中间顾此失彼的现象。四、协助行政改善矿厂安全卫生工作，加强劳动纪律。五、进一步协调劳资关系，领导与组织私营企业工人努力生产。
    会议又确定此次整风以省、市、专区为重点，着重解决领导作风与领导方法问题。并强调领导干部首先要作深刻地自我检讨，以启发下级工会提出批评与检查自己。
    察省工会干部的整风运动将在九月底结束。
