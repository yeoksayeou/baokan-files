Continue Efforts to Secure Over 100 Million Signatures!
	A Summary of the Peace Signature Campaign Over the Past Three Months
	China Committee for the Defense of World Peace

In nearly three months from the beginning of May to the present, the signature campaign for the defense of world peace has been vigorously launched throughout the country. With the unfolding of the signature campaign, following the establishment of eleven peace congress branches in Shenyang, Dalian, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Kunming, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Dihua, branch associations have also been established in fifteen cities including Harbin, Lanzhou, Ningxia, Zhengzhou, Taiyuan, Nanning, Changsha, Hangzhou, Wuchang, Chengdu, Jinzhou, Liuzhou, Wuzhou, Hebei, and Shantou. Peace signature movement committees have been established in Chahar, Rehe, Tangshan, Jining, Jilin, and other places. These organizations have become the main driving forces for the forward development of the signature campaign.

As a result of nearly three months of effort, it is estimated that over 50 million people nationwide have signed the peace declaration. In many areas, 90% or 100% of organized people have signed. In Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Tangshan, Lushun-Dalian, Jinzhou and other places, the number of signatories accounts for more than 70% of the city's residents. This is an achievement. However, compared with the total population of China, this number is still too small. We should strive to have more than 100 million people sign the peace declaration. Achieving this goal is possible, and the key is to rapidly develop the signature campaign to every county town and the vast countryside. For this purpose, it is necessary to introduce past experiences.

The unfolding of the signature campaign must rely on activists, and there are many such activists among the Chinese people. Zhang Liping, a member of the Shanghai Family Women's Federation, alone promoted the signing of 2,200 people, creating the highest personal record for the Family Women's Federation in the signature campaign. One day, she left early in the morning and carried out propaganda on an empty stomach, fainting from exhaustion. But when she was awakened, she continued to work. Six teachers from the children's literacy class in the 13th district of Beijing mobilized more than 8,000 people to sign in two or three days by going door to door. In the Hangzhou Military Region Hospital, Comrade Guo Kang had only three fingers left on his right hand. He signed his name with his trembling left hand and solemnly said: "If the imperialists dare to launch a war, I am willing to dedicate my left hand to fight them."

The signature campaign must rely on in-depth propaganda and education work. Due to the past propaganda and education work, the people across the country have improved their understanding of the opposition between the two major camps of peace and aggression and of internationalism, thereby strengthening their enthusiasm for work in their respective positions.

From the propaganda and education work on the peace signature campaign in the past three months, four experiences can be drawn:

(1) It must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner under unified leadership.

The effective ways to organize signature propaganda work mainly include three types: One is the method adopted by Tianjin, which is jointly promoted by various groups and units and implemented by various groups and units to the grassroots organized masses, and then further popularized to the general unorganized residents. Due to the adoption of this organizational method, the movement has been expanded, deepened and developed step by step.

The second is the method adopted by Tangshan, which divides the city into seven districts, establishes district committees for the peace movement, and sets up 180 signature stations, forming a comprehensive signature network. This signature network is also a propaganda network, with a propaganda team composed of more than 20,000 people, including workers, students, teachers, and government cadres, conducting in-depth propaganda.

The third is the method adopted by Chongqing, which combines the first two methods. It is intertwined vertically and horizontally, and a daily telephone reporting system has been established, with special personnel in charge of liaison work, which has achieved great results.

(2) When conducting peace signature propaganda, it is necessary to combine it with the current situation, the actual conditions of the locality, and the specific business of each department. Only in this way can we avoid being empty and generalized. Various places combined with these commemorative festivals at the commemorative rallies for Labor Day, Children's Day, "July 1", and "July 7" and put forward the slogan of defending world peace, which achieved remarkable results.

In the propaganda for defending world peace in various places, combining with the actual conditions of the locality and the specific business of each department has played an active role in promoting the signature campaign. All 6,000 miners in the Fengfeng Coal Mine signed within three days because they all understood that working hard to mine coal is increasing the strength of peace! And world peace is of great importance to their coal mining work. Cadres in Peixian County, Shandong Province, explained to farmers that the disaster was the root cause left by past imperialism and reactionary rule, and coordinated with the current central work of disaster relief, loaning seeds, loans, preventing summer famine, and repairing embankments to carry out education on defending peace, thus greatly improving the farmers' awareness of signing. Seven mosques in Chahar held prayers to spread the truth of peace, so that Muslim women who never wanted to tell their names rushed to sign and solemnly pressed their fingerprints.

(3) In the signature campaign, collect mass feedback at any time, and carry out propaganda and education in a timely manner in response to their ideological concerns. There are still some vague understandings among the masses, the most common of which is doubt about the role of signatures. We should make everyone who signs know that the people represented by millions of signatures are the great force that effectively stops war.

(4) Make full use of various propaganda tools, the methods should be flexible, and the particularities of cities and villages should be taken into account when planning work. For example, in rural areas, the peace signature campaign must be based on members of peasant associations and primary school teachers, and the propaganda methods should be lively and festive. Such as the yangko opera, waist drum, martial arts, drum words, cross talk, peep shows, revolving picture exhibitions, comics, and rooftop broadcasts that the masses like to see and hear. The content should be simple, clear, and easy to understand, and propaganda must be carried out in connection with the masses' personal experience. For example, in connection with the preparatory work for land reform, talk about the oppression of peasants by landlords to the fact that imperialism and landlords are one family and are the enemies of peasants. For farmers who have already turned over, it is necessary to explain to them how the land was obtained and how life is gradually getting better. To maintain all this, we must never allow the enemy to launch a war of aggression again.

In general, written propaganda is not suitable in villages and towns, and other propaganda methods other than writing should be used more. When the Beijing Youth Service Department propaganda team went to the countryside, it distributed many "peace window decorations", that is, leaflets with patterns and simple slogans, which achieved better propaganda results. Laiyang, Shandong, used chat to talk about the great truth of world peace when farmers were cooling off in the evening. Datong used the Hengshan Temple Fair for propaganda. These methods mobilized many farmers to participate in the signature campaign.

Some places have also adopted other effective methods in this signature campaign. For example: holding peace essay contests, train attendants of the Railway Bureau launched propaganda discussions among passengers, families who signed the whole family in the streets posted a picture of peace calligraphy and painting on the door to commend them, and eye-catching large banners were widely hung on the main transportation routes: "Who wants atomic bombs to kill people? Who doesn't oppose wars of aggression?" and so on.

An important link in the peace signature campaign is to set up signature stations in a comprehensive manner, which must be decorated in a grand manner and have someone in charge of explaining, otherwise it will become a cold stall.

(5) The progress of the signature campaign should be summarized at any time, the number of signatures should be reported at any time, and the experience of the signature campaign should be introduced at any time, and the vivid experience of advanced places should be used to promote relatively backward places.

In order to win more than 100 million signatories, we request that each county government make its own plan for the signature campaign, and use the time before the summer vacation ends to organize students and members of other people's organizations in each county to step up this work, so as to complete the plan within August. At present, the American aggression against Taiwan and Korea has aroused great indignation among the people of the whole country and the world. We should call on the people to use the signature campaign of 100 million to 200 million people to express the great determination of the Chinese people to defend world peace, and use this action to welcome the representatives of more than half of the peace-loving people in the world at the grand gathering in Poland in October this year - the Second World Peace Congress.

　　继续努力，争取一万万以上的签名者！
    三个月来的和平签名运动小结
    中国保卫世界和平大会工作委员会
    在从五月初到现在的将近三个月当中，我全国各地的保卫世界和平的签名运动，已经轰轰烈烈地展开。随着签名运动的展开，继沈阳、大连、天津、南京、上海、汉口、昆明、重庆、广州、西安、迪化等十一个和平大会分会之成立，哈尔滨、兰州、宁夏、郑州、太原、南宁、长沙、杭州、武昌、成都、锦州、柳州、梧州、河北、汕头十五个城市也成立了分支会，察哈尔、热河、唐山、济宁、吉林等地成立了和平签名运动委员会，这些组织都已成为签名运动向前发展的主要推动力。
    经过近三个月努力的结果，全国人民在和平宣言上签名的据估计已在五千万人以上。许多地区的有组织人民已经百分之九十或百分之百地签了名。上海、天津、重庆、太原、唐山、旅大、锦州等地，签名者占了全城居民的百分之七十以上。这是一个成绩。但是用中国人口总数来比较，这个数目还太小了，我们应当争取有一万万以上的人在和平宣言上签名。达到这个目的是可能的，关键是在将签名运动迅速发展到每一个县城和广大的农村中去。为着这个目的，介绍一下过去的经验是必要的。
    展开签名运动必须依靠积极分子，而这样的积极分子在中国人民中是很多很多的。上海市家庭妇联的会员张丽萍一个人推动了二千二百人签名，创造了家庭妇联在签名运动中个人的最高纪录。有一天，她清晨即出门，饿着肚子进行宣传，因疲劳过度而晕倒了。但当被人救醒后，她仍继续进行工作。北京十三区儿童识字班教员六人，在两、三天内挨户发动了八千余人签名。杭州军区医院里，郭康同志右手只剩下三个指头，他用颤抖的左手签上自己的名字，并郑重地说道：“假使帝国主义敢于发动战争，我愿献出左手来和他们拚。”
    签名运动必须依靠深入的宣传教育工作，由于过去的宣传教育工作，全国各地人民对于和平、侵略两大阵营的对立，以及国际主义的认识已经提高了一步，并且因此加强了他们在各自岗位上工作的积极性。
    从近三个月来关于和平签名运动的宣传教育工作，可以得到四点经验：
    （一）必须在统一的领导之下，有计划、有步骤地进行。
    组织签名宣传工作的有效方式，主要有三种：一种是像天津所采取的，由各团体、单位联合推动，由各团体、单位分别贯彻到基层有组织群众，再进一步普及于一般尚无组织的居民。由于采取了这种组织方式，运动已一步进一步地扩大、深入和发展。
    另一种是像唐山所采取的，将全市划分为七个区，建立了和运区委会，并设立了一百八十处签名站，组成了一个全面的签名网。这签名网同时又是宣传网，由工人、学生、教员、机关干部等二万余人组成的宣传队，进行深入宣传。
    第三种是像重庆所采取的，把前两种方式兼用。纵横交织，并且建立了每日电话汇报制度，专人掌握联系工作，收到很大的效果。
    （二）进行和平签名宣传时，要与当前的形势、当地的实际情况和各部门的具体业务相结合，只有这样，才能避免空泛和一般化。各地在劳动节、儿童节、“七一”、“七七”的纪念集会上，都与这些纪念节结合提出了保卫世界和平的口号，获得了显著的成绩。
    各地在保卫世界和平宣传中，和当地的实际情况和各部门的具体业务相结合，对签名运动曾有积极推进的作用。峰峰煤矿全体矿工六千余人，在三天以内都签了名，这是因为他们都已经懂得：卖劲挖煤就是增加和平力量！而世界和平对他们的挖煤工作是有莫大关系的。山东沛县干部向农民说明灾荒是过去帝国主义和反动统治留下的祸根，并配合当前救灾、贷种、贷款、防夏荒、修堤等中心工作，进行保卫和平的教育，农民签名的自觉性因而大为提高。察哈尔七个清真寺作了传布和平真理的礼拜，使得从来不肯将名字告诉别人的回教妇女，这回都赶着签名，还郑重地按上手印。
    （三）在签名运动中随时收集群众反映，针对其思想顾虑，及时地进行宣传教育。现在群众中尚存在着一些模糊的认识，最普遍的是怀疑签名的作用。我们应该使每一签名的人都知道千千万万签名所代表的人民，就是有效地制止战争的伟大力量。
    （四）充分运用各种宣传工具，方式要灵活，在计划工作时要照顾城市和乡村的特殊性。例如在农村中，和平签名运动必须以农会会员、小学教员为骨干，宣传方式宜活泼热闹。如群众所喜见乐闻的秧歌剧、腰鼓、武术、鼓词、相声、拉洋片、轮回图片展览、漫画、屋顶广播等。内容要简单明了、浅显通俗，并须联系群众切身经验进行宣传。例如结合土地改革的准备工作，从地主对农民的压迫说到帝国主义和地主是一家，是农民的敌人。对于业已翻了身的农民要向他们说明田地是怎样得到的，日子又是怎样逐渐好起来的，要保持这一切，就绝对不能允许敌人再来发动侵略战争。
    在村镇中一般地不适用文字宣传，应多用文字以外的其他宣传方式。北京青年服务部宣传队下乡时，散发了许多“和平窗花”，即以图案画为主，写着一些简单口号的传单，得到了较好的宣传效果。山东莱阳在农民傍晚纳凉时，用闲谈的方式讲讲天下太平的大道理。大同利用恒山庙会来进行宣传。这些方式都动员了许多农民参加签名运动。
    有的地方在这次签名运动中还采取了其他有效的方式。例如：举办和平征文，铁路局的列车员在旅客中展开宣传讨论，街区中全家签名的人家大门贴上一张和平字画以资表扬，各交通要道普遍悬挂引人注目的巨幅标语：“谁愿意原子弹杀人？谁不反对侵略战争？”等等。
    和平签名运动的一个重要环节，就是普遍设立签名站，要布置得很隆重，有专人负责讲解，否则就会变成冷摊子。
    （五）签名运动的进展状况要随时总结，随时报告签名人数，随时介绍签名运动的经验，用先进的地方的生动经验来推动比较落后的地方。
    为了争取一万万个以上的签名者，我们要求每个县政府对于签名运动都作出自己的计划来，利用暑假还未结束的时候组织各县的学生和其他人民团体的会员加紧进行这一工作，以求在八月份以内完成计划。目前美国侵略台湾朝鲜，已经引起全国人民和全世界极大的愤慨，我们应该号召人民用一万万人到两万万人的签名运动来表示中国人民保卫世界和平的伟大决心，并且用这个行动来迎接今年十月全世界半数以上和平人民的代表在波兰的大集会——第二届世界和平大会。
