Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 20th. The Executive Bureau of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress held a press conference on the 18th, attended by more than 60 reporters. The press conference was presided over by D'Arboussier, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee. Others present included Laffitte, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee, Vice-Chairmen Bernal (UK), Roach (US), and Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg and Chinese scientist Wu Youxun, who were attending the Executive Bureau meeting.

Associated Press and United Press reporters raised provocative questions, asking why the Executive Bureau's statement did not point out that the United States was the aggressor in the Korean War. Ehrenburg replied that there were no Korean or Chinese soldiers in the United States, but US troops were massacring people in Korea. Who is the aggressor is very clear. The American reporter who asked the question was greatly embarrassed.

Reporters from the Italian newspaper Unità and Czech newspapers successively raised the issue of Western reactionaries continuing to threaten peace-loving people with atomic bombs and intensifying the suppression of the peace movement, which was answered one by one by D'Arboussier and others.

This reporter requested Roach to respond to his views on Truman's statement on the Taiwan issue. Roach's reply was a rambling, irrelevant talk. After Ehrenburg pointed out that "Mr. Roach did not give a direct answer to the Taiwan issue," Roach remained silent.

　　和大常委会执行局
    举行记者招待会
    爱伦堡斥美记者挑拨性询问
    【新华社布拉格二十日电】世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局于十八日举行招待记者会，到记者六十余人。招待会由和大常委会副主席达波赛主持。出席者尚有常委会总书记拉菲德、副主席贝尔纳（英）、罗奇（美）及参加此次执行局会议的苏联作家爱伦堡、中国科学家吴有训等人。
    美联社及合众社记者提出挑拨性的询问说：执行局的声明中何以不指出美国为朝鲜战争的侵略者。爱伦堡回答说：在美国并没有朝鲜兵或中国兵，美军却在朝鲜屠杀着人民。谁是侵略者，道理甚明。发问的美记者大为窘促。
    意大利团结报记者和捷克报纸的记者相继提出西方反动派继续以原子弹威吓爱好和平的人民及加紧镇压和平运动的问题，由达波赛等一一予以答复。
    本社记者请求罗奇答复他对杜鲁门关于台湾问题的声明的看法。罗奇的答复是一篇不着边际的空谈。经爱伦堡指出“罗奇先生并未对台湾问题作正面答复”之后，罗奇即沉默不语。
