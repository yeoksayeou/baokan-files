    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十日讯：德意志民主共和国计划部发表一九五○年第二季生产计划完成情形的报告。报告指出：共和国经济各部门在本季中均有进一步的发展。
    德意志民主共和国本年第二季总的工业生产计划，已完成百分之一○七·五。工业总生产量与去年同一时期相较，增加了百分之二六·六。如以去年第二季的生产数字为基数（一○○），则今年第二季各种主要工业生产的数字如下：电力一一七，褐煤一○九，铣铁一六一，钢一五九，辗金属二三四，水泥一一九，电动机二五二，各种车辆一五四至三○六，拖拉机则已增至百分之二七四○。
    农业方面，据初步统计：本年耕地面积比去年增加了十一万四千公顷，预料今年每公顷平均产量可达到战前水平，若干作物并将超过。此外，国内水陆货运及国外贸易亦均有满意的发展。
    由于工业生产的增加，工人及其他雇员就业人数已较去年同季增加了二十三万八千人。由于农产品和日用品生产的增加与对外贸易扩大后苏联及人民民主国家粮食入口的增加，人民生活水平已大有改善。
