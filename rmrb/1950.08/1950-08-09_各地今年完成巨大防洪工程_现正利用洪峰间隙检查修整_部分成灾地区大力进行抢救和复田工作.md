Xinhua News Agency, July 7th: By the end of June, the national flood control projects for all rivers in 1950 had been basically completed victoriously. However, due to the short time and limitations of manpower and resources, this year's projects are still far from meeting the requirements for preventing all floods. Therefore, flood prevention work this summer remains an arduous task for the entire nation. Since late June, the major rivers across the country have entered the flood season. Up to now, most parts of the country have engaged in the first round of struggle against floods. Under the leadership of the flood control headquarters, people in various regions are taking advantage of the intervals between flood peaks to conduct another inspection and repair of the river embankments. In areas of the Huai River basin in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui, as well as other regions, where waterlogging and embankment breaches have caused flooding, the local people's governments are leading the people in vigorously carrying out rescue and land reclamation work.

Nationwide Completion of Over 300 Million Cubic Meters of Earthwork

This year's flood control projects for rivers across the country, except for parts of East China and Central-South China where some work was carried out last winter, began construction in January and February this year in other regions, and were basically completed victoriously by the end of June. The scale of the project is unprecedented in China in recent decades, with earthwork alone reaching more than 365 million cubic meters (of which more than 35 million cubic meters were undertaken with local funds in East China), mobilizing a total of more than 4.69 million workers. The completion of these projects has generally strengthened the embankments of various rivers, providing a considerable degree of guarantee for agricultural production along the rivers, and also enabling millions of disaster victims to survive the severe spring famine. The construction policy for the above-mentioned river management projects is based on the decision of the National Water Conservancy Joint Conference of Liberated Areas in November last year: East China, Central-South China, and North China districts should focus on flood control and drainage, followed by irrigation; the above-mentioned three districts have completed a total of over 310 million cubic meters of earthwork for flood control projects. The Northwest focuses on irrigation, followed by flood control; this region has restored and expanded the irrigated area by approximately 4.7 million mu this year. The Northeast is carrying out flood control and irrigation simultaneously; a total of over 19.5 million cubic meters of earthwork for flood control projects has been completed, and the irrigation projects constructed this year have increased the paddy field area by approximately 315,000 mu. On a nationwide scale, flood control and drainage account for approximately 73 percent of the total water conservancy expenditure, canal irrigation accounts for approximately 19 percent, surveying and research account for approximately 4.7 percent, and the remainder accounts for approximately 3.3 percent.

This year's river defense projects have achieved great results, but there are also many shortcomings. These shortcomings are mainly: First, there is a lack of systematic investigation and research, and insufficient understanding of the situation of various rivers and regions, resulting in the phenomenon of reversing the priorities in some individual areas during the project implementation. Second, some areas lack planning in construction, do not calculate economic benefits, and blindly carry out construction based solely on subjective demands, resulting in waste. Third, some water conservancy work cadres still have a bureaucratic work style. During the construction preparation and construction process, they failed to effectively and responsibly solve the problems of the workers. Fourth, the initial problems of earthwork unit prices and food distribution were also not well resolved.

The Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government promptly reviewed and corrected the above shortcomings at the National Flood Prevention Conference held in May this year. At the same time, the conference stipulated the specific tasks of flood prevention work for various rivers based on the actual situation of the flood control projects of each river. The conference also stipulated that local administrative organs should be the main body of flood prevention in various regions this year, and establish unified flood prevention organizations. Immediately after the National Flood Prevention Conference, the Central Flood Prevention Headquarters was established in Beijing on June 3rd. From June 3rd to 28th, major administrative regions such as Central-South China, East China, Northeast China, and the Yellow River basin successively established flood prevention headquarters, and provinces and cities such as Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Tianjin also established flood prevention headquarters. Other provinces and regions, as well as special districts, counties, districts, townships, and villages, successively followed the spirit of the National Flood Prevention Conference and established unified flood prevention organizations from top to bottom. As of the end of July, there were a total of 334 flood reporting stations using telecommunications along the major rivers across the country, of which 68 directly reported to the Central Flood Prevention Headquarters, and 40 flood reporting stations were equipped with dedicated stations. Most of them started flood reporting work from the beginning of July. In order to ensure the steady progress of flood prevention work, the Central Flood Prevention Headquarters issued instructions on June 13th regarding a major inspection of embankments, so as to repair dangerous works in a timely manner and reduce unexpected disasters.

Huai River Basin Suffers Flooding, Local People Vigorously Rescue

Although this summer's national flood prevention work has undergone the above-mentioned thorough arrangements and measures, it is impossible to completely solve the water problems of decades in half a year due to the short construction time of various rivers. Therefore, although people in various regions have vigorously carried out embankment inspection and protection work under the specific leadership of the local people's governments, some areas are still inevitably experiencing floods. So far, the flood disaster has mainly occurred in the Huai River basin in northern Anhui. After late June, the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River encountered continuous heavy rain, causing the water level in the middle and lower reaches to rise above the highest flood level in 1931, and many embankments along the river were flooded, inundating more than 17.7 million mu of land in Fuyang, Suxian, Liu'an, and Chuxian special districts. The reason for the Huai River flood is mainly the result of the Kuomintang's excavation and destruction of the Yellow River embankments in 1938, which caused the Yellow River water to enter the Huai River and damage the drainage system of the Huai River. To thoroughly manage the disasters left by the Kuomintang for many years cannot be completed in a short period of time. The direct cause of the disaster was the heavy rain that arrived on June 27 this year, which was widespread and concentrated in rainfall. In addition, there are also shortcomings in the flood prevention work in northern Anhui. There was insufficient estimation of the water situation in advance, lack of in-depth inspection of the embankment works, and lack of full preparation in terms of ideology, organization, and materials for the embankment. Otherwise, the disaster could have been alleviated to some extent. After the East China Military and Political Committee and the local people's government led the people in vigorously rescuing, the flood situation in the Huai River has stopped developing.

The Yellow River Basin Flood Prevention Leading Authority has three years of experience in overcoming the Yellow River floods. In addition to establishing a series of flood prevention organizations from top to bottom, it has also led the people in the provinces along the river to conduct embankment inspections. Because the distance between the embankments in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, it is estimated that if the flow at the Shanzhou station of the Yellow River exceeds 17,000 cubic meters per second (the guaranteed flow for Yellow River flood prevention), it will not be able to safely discharge the flood. Therefore, the Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters has decided to take the following measures when necessary: (1) Abandoning the people's embankments. (2) Implementing flood storage north of Jinxianling in Nanwang County, Pingyuan Province, on the south bank, and south of Jindi in Shouzhang County, on the north bank. (3) Dongping Lake and the riverside areas of Changqing and Pingyin counties in Shandong Province should also be used for flood storage when necessary.

The main dangerous works in the Yangtze River basin are the Jingjiang Dam in Hubei Province and the Tongma Dam section at the junction of Anhui and Hubei provinces. During the autumn flood season, the flood peaks of the Yangtze River, the Han River, and the four rivers of Hunan Province, namely Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Feng, may converge in Hankou, directly threatening the Jingjiang Dam. Therefore, before the Yangtze River flood storage problem is fundamentally resolved, the flood prevention work of this section of the embankment must be closely monitored. The Tongma Dam is located at the junction of northern Anhui and Hubei, facing the river and backing the lake, and has always been a dangerous section. Joint prevention work must be particularly strengthened.

The northern Jiangsu area was one of the worst-hit areas in last year's flood disaster. Although the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office led the people in carrying out the Yi River diversion and Shu River regulation projects at the urgent request of the people, it has not completely solved the flood problem. The Yi River diversion project, after two seasons of construction last winter and this spring, reached 38 million cubic meters of earthwork, mobilizing 570,000 workers. However, because the project construction was passive, although the opening of the Xin Yi River project has achieved great results, there are still many shortcomings. The main shortcomings are: First, the water confinement and beach overflow have not excavated the central channel, and the main flow may swing along the terrain. Second, some embankment works were not compacted due to rush work, which may cause dangers. Third, the inland rivers flowing north and south in northern Jiangsu, such as the Liutang River, Liulaojian River, Shaqiang River, and Qiangwei River, are cut off by the Xin Yi River to the east and west, and the problem of inland water drainage has not been resolved before the flood season this year. Therefore, some areas on both sides of the Xin Yi River are still inevitably suffering from waterlogging this year.

Among the rivers in North China, the new channel opening project of the Chaobai River in Hebei has been completed, and the flood disaster in Xianghe and Baodi areas this year can be reduced by more than one-half. The Yongding River is very important because it relates to the safety of the Beijing-Tianjin traffic on the Beining Railway and the lives and property of the people in several counties in the Beijing-Tianjin area. However, the river has rapid floods, carries a large amount of sand, and the riverbed changes drastically. Moreover, the downstream river channel is narrow and cannot fundamentally handle larger floods. Before the completion of the fundamental projects such as the Guanting Reservoir, it is still necessary to use the flood area to slow down the water, so as to avoid the threat to Tianjin. When necessary, it is also necessary to divert the water into the Xiaoqing River to reduce the threat to the railway. The river has flooded four times since the arrival of the flood season this year, and it has been successfully overcome through vigorous rescue and protection. However, the northward shift of the flow trend below Lianggezhuang still poses a danger.

The people along the embankments of other major rivers across the country have successively conducted one or several embankment inspections under the leadership of the local flood prevention headquarters, and have repaired the unstable and dangerous embankment sections in a timely manner. The next two or three months are still the tense stage of flood prevention for the people in the river basins across the country.

　　各地今年完成巨大防洪工程
    现正利用洪峰间隙检查修整
    部分成灾地区大力进行抢救和复田工作
    【新华社七日讯】一九五○年全国各河的防洪工程，至六月底止已基本上胜利完成。但由于时间短促和人力、物力的限制，今年的工程，距离防止全部水灾发生的要求尚远。因此，今夏全国的防汛工作，仍然是一个艰巨的任务。六月下旬起，全国各主要河流已进入防汛阶段。至现在止，全国大部地区已进行了与洪水斗争的第一回合。各地人民在防汛指挥部领导下，正利用汛期洪峰间隙，再次进行各河堤防的检查与修整工作。苏北、皖北淮河流域及其他部分地区因积水和河堤溃决，洪水漫溢成灾的地区，当地人民政府正领导人民大力进行抢救和复田工作。
  全国完成土工三万万多公方
    今年全国河流防洪工程，除华东及中南部分地区已于去冬进行一部分外，其他地区均于今年一二月间开始施工，至六月底基本上胜利完成。工程规模之大是我国数十年来所没有的，仅土工一项即达三亿六千五百多万公方（其中三千五百余万公方为华东地方经费所举办），动员民工共达四百六十九万余人。这些工程的完成，使各河堤防普遍加强，沿河农产，得到了相当程度的保证，同时也使得千万以上的灾民，借此度过了今春严重的灾荒。上述治河工程的施工方针系根据去年十一月全国各解放区水利联席会议的决定：华东、中南、华北三区以防洪排水为主，灌溉为次；现上述三区共完成防洪工程土工三亿一千余万公方。西北以灌溉为主，防洪为次；该区今年一共已恢复和扩大灌田面积约达四百七十万亩。东北是防洪与灌溉同时进行；共已完成防洪工程土工一千九百五十余万公方，今年所修灌溉工程增加水田面积约三十一万五千亩。就全国范围说，防洪排水约占全部水利事业费的百分之七十三，开渠灌溉约占百分之十九，勘测研究约占百分之四点七，其余约占百分之三点三。
    今年的河防工程是有很大成绩的，但也存在着许多缺点。这些缺点主要是：第一，缺乏系统的调查研究，对各河流，各地区情况了解不足，因而在工程进行中个别地区发生轻重倒置的现象。第二，有的地区施工缺乏计划性，不计算经济效益，仅凭主观要求，盲目施工，造成浪费。第三，部分水利工作干部还存在着官僚主义的工作作风。在施工准备及施工过程中，未能切实负责地解决民工的问题。第四，土工单价与工粮发放问题最初亦未能很好解决。
    以上缺点，中央人民政府水利部在今年五月召开全国防汛会议时，已及时加以检讨和纠正。同时，会议根据各河防洪工程的实际情况规定了各河防汛工作的具体任务。会议并规定今年各地防汛以地方行政机关为主体，建立统一的防汛机构。紧接着召开全国防汛会议之后，中央防汛总指挥部于六月三日在京成立。从六月三日到二十八日，各大行政区如中南、华东、东北及黄河流域均先后成立防汛总指挥部，各省市如河北、平原、山西、绥远等省及天津市亦均成立防汛指挥部，其他各省区以至专署、县、区、乡、村亦相继遵照全国防汛会议的精神，自上而下建立了统一的防汛机构。至七月底止，全国各主要河流沿岸使用电讯的报汛站共三百三十四处，其中直接向中央防汛总指挥部报汛的有六十八处，设专台的报汛站四十处。大部分自七月初起即开始报汛工作。为使防汛工作稳步进行，中央防汛总指挥部曾于六月十三日发关于堤防大检查的指示，以便及时修整险工，减少意外的灾害。
  淮河流域发生水患当地人民大力抢救
    今夏全国性的防汛工作，虽然经过以上的周密布置和措施，但由于各河施工时间的短促，不可能在半年内就完全解决数十年来的水患问题。因此，各地人民在各地人民政府具体领导下，虽已大力进行了查堤和护堤工作，部分地区仍不免发生水患。迄今为止，水灾主要在皖北地区的淮河流域发生。六月下旬以后，淮河上中游遭遇连续暴雨，使中下游水位上涨超过一九三一年最高洪水位，沿河堤防多处因而漫决，阜阳、宿县、六安、滁县等专区被洪水全淹土地达一千七百余万亩。淮河水灾所以发生，主要是一九三八年国民党掘毁黄河堤岸，使黄水入淮破坏了淮河水系排水系统的结果。对于国民党多年来遗下的灾害，要彻底治理，决非短期间所能完成。成灾的直接原因是今年六月二十七日暴雨到来，面积既广，雨量又集中。此外，皖北防汛工作也有缺点，事先对水情估计不足，对堤工缺乏深入检查，在思想上、组织上、物质上对堤防也缺乏充分准备。否则，此次灾情是可以减轻一些的。现经华东军政委员会与当地人民政府领导人民大力抢救后，淮河灾情已经停止发展。
    黄河流域防汛领导机关有了三年的战胜黄水的经验，除已自上而下建立了一系列的防汛组织外，并领导沿河各省人民进行了堤防检查。由于黄河中下游堤距上宽下窄，估计如果黄河陕州站流量超过一万七千秒公方（黄河防汛的保证流量）时，即将不能安全排泄。因此，黄河防汛总指挥部决定必要时采取以下措施：（一）放弃民埝。（二）在南岸平原省南旺县金线岭以北，北岸寿张县金堤以南实行蓄洪。（三）东平湖及山东省长清、平阴两县沿河地区必要时亦用以蓄洪。
    长江流域主要险工在湖北省境的荆江大堤和皖、鄂交界处的同马堤段。秋汛时长江、汉水和湖南湘、资、沅、沣四水洪峰可能一齐在汉口会合，直接威胁荆江大堤。因此，在长江蓄洪问题未根本解决前，此段堤防的防汛工作须严密注意。同马堤在皖北、湖北交界处，面江背湖，向来是险工地段，联防工作尤须特别加强。
    苏北地区是去年遭受水灾的重灾区之一。今年苏北人民行署虽在人民迫切要求下领导人民进行了导沂、整沭工程，但仍未完全解决水患问题。导沂工程，经去冬今春两季施工，仅土工即达三千八百万公方，动员民工达五十七万人。但因工程施工处于被动，因此：开辟新沂河工程成绩虽大，缺点还很多。主要的缺点是：第一，束水漫滩并未开挖中泓，大溜可能顺地形而摆动。第二，部分堤工因突击工作致未能打硪，可能发生险象。第三，苏北南北向流的六塘河、刘老涧河、沙礓河、蔷薇河等内水河道，被新沂河东西隔断，内水排泄问题，今年汛前尚未能加以解决，因此新沂河两岸部分地区今年仍不免积水为患。
    华北各河中，河北潮白河新河道开辟工程业已完工，香河、宝坻一带今年的水患可以减轻二分之一以上。永定河关系北宁路京、津交通及京、津一带数县人生命财产的安全，甚为重要。但该河洪流疾迅，挟沙量大，河床变化甚剧，且下游河槽狭窄，根本不能承泄较大的洪水。在官厅水库等治本工程完成以前，仍须利用泛区缓水，以免除对天津市的威胁。必要时且须分水入小清河以减轻对铁路的威胁。今年汛期到来后该河已四次涨水，经大力抢护，均胜利度过。但梁各庄以下溜势北移，危险仍然存在。
    其他全国各主要河流堤防，沿河人民在当地防汛指挥部领导下已先后进行过一次或数次堤防检查，并及时修补了不稳固和危险的堤段。今后两三个月内仍是全国各江河流域人民防汛的紧张阶段。
