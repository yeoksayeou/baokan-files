　　Guangdong's Overseas Chinese Affairs Work is Underway
　　By Our Special Correspondent Gu Weijin
　　There are approximately 6.4 million Overseas Chinese of Guangdong origin, accounting for about 57 percent of the 11.1 million Overseas Chinese in the country. About 6.2 million of them reside in Siam, Malaya, Vietnam, the Philippines, Burma, and Indonesia, and about 200,000 reside in the Americas.
　　The Kuomintang reactionary government not only failed to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese but also undermined them. Remittances sent back home often suffered losses due to unreasonable exchange rates. Especially during the period when the Kuomintang reactionaries launched the civil war, currency inflated malignantly, and the official exchange rate differed greatly from the black market exchange rate. Remittances sent home often suffered losses of 25 to 50 percent. When Overseas Chinese dependents received remittances, prices rose several times a day, resulting in actual receipts of only 20 to 30 percent. Disputes over Overseas Chinese property also failed to be resolved reasonably. The pseudo-Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Property Protection Committee handled disputes over Overseas Chinese property by adopting a "guaranteed litigation" approach: whoever paid more money was guaranteed to win the lawsuit. The pseudo-government had stipulated many regulations for Overseas Chinese children returning to the country for further education under the guise of "guiding students to higher education," but these were not implemented. Moreover, it arbitrarily added unwarranted charges to slightly progressive Overseas Chinese students and arrested them. Overseas Chinese going abroad were subjected to extortion by the pseudo-Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and diplomatic organs. For example, to complete the formalities for going abroad at a diplomatic organ, one had to be the person or a direct relative; if someone else handled it on their behalf, they had to spend a lot of money. Obtaining a certificate of departure from the pseudo-Overseas Chinese Affairs Office also cost five to ten Hong Kong dollars. All of this caused extreme dissatisfaction among Overseas Chinese. Consequently, in recent years, remittances gradually decreased, and Overseas Chinese lost interest and confidence in investing in the economic construction of their motherland.
　　After the liberation of Guangdong, the People's Government's policy towards Overseas Chinese was completely different from that of the Kuomintang reactionaries. The People's Government, based on the spirit of Article 58 of the Common Program, which stipulates that "the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China shall endeavor to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese abroad," actively protects the legitimate rights and interests of Overseas Chinese and established the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Overseas Chinese Commission) to serve Overseas Chinese exclusively.
　　Promoting remittances back home and maintaining the livelihood of Overseas Chinese dependents is the most important part of Overseas Chinese service work. A large number of Overseas Chinese dependents in the province rely on remittances for their livelihood, as can be clearly seen from the typical survey conducted by the Overseas Chinese Commission in Overseas Chinese areas. For example, in Hengkangshan Village, Third District, Taishan County, Yuezhong District, the total population of the village is 312, of which 211 are Overseas Chinese and their dependents, accounting for 67.6 percent of the village's population. Those who rely on remittances to supply their livelihood for the whole year account for 41.48 percent; those who rely on remittances to supply 80 percent or more of their livelihood for the whole year account for 14.7 percent; those who rely on remittances to supply 60 percent or more of their livelihood for the whole year account for 12.2 percent; in total, Overseas Chinese dependents who rely on remittances to supply their livelihood for the whole year account for 68.3 percent of the 211 Overseas Chinese households in the village. In Liulong Village, Eighth District, Chao'an County, Chaoshan District, there are 322 households in the village, of which 125 are Overseas Chinese dependents, accounting for 34.53 percent of the village's households. Overseas Chinese dependents whose livelihood depends on remittances account for 72.5 percent, those who depend on land for their livelihood account for 21.6 percent, and those who depend on other sources for their livelihood account for 5.8 percent. It is clear that remittances are closely related to the livelihood of Overseas Chinese dependents, and promoting remittances back home is very important.
　　However, in the early stage of promoting remittances back home, from November last year to March this year, several difficulties were encountered. At that time, the country's finance and prices had not yet stabilized, and it was still difficult to maintain the value of remittances. In addition, in the work of grain requisitioning, taxation, and promotion of public bonds in various places, cadres also had some deviations in grasping policies (for example, in grain requisitioning, cadres in some places saw that Overseas Chinese dependents had more remittances and treated them as landlords for requisitioning), which caused dissatisfaction among Overseas Chinese. At that time, Hainan Island had not yet been liberated, and bandits and special agents spread rumors in various ways. All of this made Overseas Chinese have many concerns about remitting money back home, and the number of remittances was less than the monthly average in the four years before liberation.
　　But starting from April this year, the downward trend of remittances has gradually been reversed. The Guangzhou People's Bank received more remittances in April alone than the total amount received by the bank in the previous three months by over 45 percent. Remittances received in May increased by 38 percent compared to April, and remittances received in June increased by 22 percent compared to May. Remittances received by the Chaoshan People's Bank in April reached the saturation point of the most prosperous period before the War of Resistance Against Japan. Remittances received by the People's Banks in Taishan and Xincheng in April increased by more than 140 percent compared to the monthly average in the four months from December last year to March this year. Remittances received by the Huizhou People's Bank in April almost doubled compared to March. Remittances in various places increased sharply in May and June. The basic reasons for the improvement of remittances are, first, the unification of national finance and economy, the stabilization of finance and prices, the People's Bank's setting of reasonable and unified exchange rates for remittances, and the basic solution of the problem of maintaining the value of remittances. At the same time, the Overseas Chinese Commission often reflects the opinions of Overseas Chinese dependents on remittances to the People's Bank, and the People's Bank implements many measures to give preferential treatment to remittances (such as remittances in the original currency, and exemption of handling fees for remittances). In addition, the government implements a policy of "public ownership of foreign exchange and private ownership of profits" for the Overseas Chinese remittance industry, encouraging and guiding the Overseas Chinese remittance industry to embark on a legitimate path. Secondly, the government gradually corrected the biases in grain requisitioning, taxation, and promotion of public bonds, and the Overseas Chinese Commission cooperated with this work to conduct various publicity and explanations among Overseas Chinese dependents to eliminate the dissatisfaction of Overseas Chinese. At the same time, the liberation of Hainan Island stabilized the situation in Guangdong and shattered the rumors spread by bandits and special agents. Due to the above reasons, Overseas Chinese dependents gradually understood the government's policy of protecting remittances and wrote letters to overseas relatives asking them to send money back.
　　The improvement of remittances has gradually solved the difficulties in the lives of the vast number of Overseas Chinese dependents during the spring famine.
　　Solving the long-term disputes over Overseas Chinese property is the urgent demand of Overseas Chinese from the People's Government. In recent months, the Overseas Chinese Commission has been actively carrying out this work, starting from Guangzhou. The main contents and handling methods of Overseas Chinese property disputes are as follows: (1) Thirteen cases of empty houses being borrowed by organs and troops during the liberation have all been dealt with and resolved. The solution is: requiring organs and troops to move out within a time limit, and compensating for all damaged items. If the owner is willing to rent, the organs and troops can rent the houses. (2) Nine cases of houses rented to reactionary elements before liberation and temporarily managed by the People's Government after liberation due to unknown owners have been resolved in three cases. The solution is: investigate clearly and return the property to its original owner. (3) Nine cases of houses being forcibly occupied have been resolved in seven cases. The solution is: investigate and verify, and return the property to its original owner. (4) Thirty-eight ordinary rental disputes have been resolved in thirty-four cases. The solution is: the Overseas Chinese Commission assists the owner in reasoning with the other party, so that the other party pays the rent on time. Due to the fair handling of Overseas Chinese property disputes by the Overseas Chinese Commission, the number of Overseas Chinese dependents requesting the handling of Overseas Chinese property disputes is increasing. Currently, the Overseas Chinese Commission, together with the People's Court, the Land Administration Bureau, the Public and Counter-Revolutionary Property Clearance Office, and the Returned Overseas Chinese Federation, has jointly organized a Mediation Committee for Overseas Chinese Property Disputes, mainly responsible for mediation work by the People's Court. This is of great benefit to concentrating efforts and quickly solving problems.
　　With the vigorous development of the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, the imperialism's rule over colonies is becoming increasingly cruel, and the situation of Overseas Chinese is deteriorating. A large number of Overseas Chinese students who have suffered from imperialist persecution and lost their freedom to study are returning to the embrace of the motherland. The People's Government actively assists them in entering schools and universities to cultivate them into talents for the construction of New China. The Overseas Chinese Commission has introduced them to various schools for entrance examinations, including 142 who went to Beijing to take entrance examinations and 83 who took entrance examinations in Guangzhou City. Seventy-two were introduced to study at Southern University. Currently, Southern University has not yet completed the construction of its school buildings, and there are still 100 Overseas Chinese students living in the Overseas Chinese Commission's guest house waiting to take entrance examinations. In view of the special difficulties of Overseas Chinese students in entering schools and universities, the Overseas Chinese Commission has suggested that the government formulate interim measures for giving preferential treatment to Overseas Chinese students returning to the country for schooling (such as allowing those who fail in two or three subjects in the examination to enter the corresponding grade and study in the class, and helping them to make up for the failed subjects. Overseas Chinese students from poor families can obtain people's scholarships). The measures were promulgated and implemented in June.
　　Before the implementation of land reform in Guangdong, conducting investigations and research on the land issue of Overseas Chinese in order to properly handle it according to the specific circumstances of various places during the land reform is a very important task in Overseas Chinese service work. To this end, the Overseas Chinese Commission sent people to the famous Overseas Chinese area of Chaoshan District in early March to convene a symposium on the land issue for local returned Overseas Chinese to initially understand the land situation in the district. In April, the Overseas Chinese Commission and the Research Office of the South China Sub-Bureau of the CPC jointly invited the Siamese Overseas Chinese Touring Group to hold a symposium on the Overseas Chinese land issue, and jointly dispatched a land investigation team with the group to conduct on-the-spot investigation work in the four major Overseas Chinese areas of Yuezhong, Dongjiang, Zhujiang, and Chaoshan. At the end of May, the Overseas Chinese Commission sent four more land investigation teams to conduct key typical investigations in the six major Overseas Chinese areas of Xing (Ning) Mei (County) District, Chaoshan District, Dongjiang District, Yuezhong District, Zhujiang District, and Hainan District, which are expected to be completed by the end of July.
　　At present, the number of returned Overseas Chinese is increasing, and the work of serving Overseas Chinese is gradually becoming heavier. It is difficult to do a good job relying solely on the government's Overseas Chinese affairs agencies (i.e., the Overseas Chinese Commission). Therefore, under the suggestion and assistance of the Overseas Chinese Commission, the preparatory committee of the Guangdong General Branch of the Returned Overseas Chinese Federation was established at the end of May, and similar organizations in various places are also being established. The service content of the Returned Overseas Chinese Federation is to unite returned Overseas Chinese, contact Overseas Chinese overseas, and timely reflect the opinions and demands of Overseas Chinese to the government, becoming a bridge connecting the government and Overseas Chinese.
　　In the past six months, Guangdong's Overseas Chinese affairs work has been gradually developing. But there is still a big shortcoming, that is, the Overseas Chinese affairs agencies are not sound. In addition to the provincial-level Overseas Chinese affairs agency (i.e., the Overseas Chinese Commission), most of the special prefectures and counties do not have Overseas Chinese affairs agencies, and many tasks cannot be promoted. For example, organizing Overseas Chinese dependents to participate in production and disaster relief is one of the central tasks of the Overseas Chinese Commission in the past six months, but because of the lack of lower-level agencies, the Overseas Chinese Commission can only make general appeals and cannot cooperate with governments at all levels to participate in specific leadership in a focused manner.
　　Doing a good job in serving Overseas Chinese is to do a good job in uniting the tens of millions of Overseas Chinese dependents at home and the tens of millions of Overseas Chinese abroad. And uniting Overseas Chinese is closely related to uniting the forces of peace and democracy in Southeast Asia and the Americas. Therefore, it is very important today to quickly improve the Overseas Chinese affairs agencies and do a good job in serving Overseas Chinese.

　　广东侨务工作在开展中
    本报特派记者  古维进
    广东籍华侨约有六百四十万人，约占全国华侨一千一百一十余万人的百分之五十七左右。他们侨居在暹罗、马来亚、越南、菲律宾、缅甸印尼一带的约有六百二十万人，侨居在美洲一带的约有二十万人。
    国民党反动政府对于华侨的正当权益非但没有加以保护反而加以摧残。侨汇回国，因牌价不合理，时常受到损失，尤其在国民党反动派发动内战期间，通货恶性膨胀，官定汇价与黑市汇价相差很大，侨汇回国常常遭受百分之二十五至五十的损失。侨眷收到汇款时，物价一日数涨，致使汇款实际所得不足百分之二、三十。华侨侨产的纠纷也得不到合理解决。伪广州侨产保障委员会处理侨产的纠纷，采取“包打官司”的办法：谁出的钱多，包谁打赢官司。伪政府对于华侨子弟回国升学，曾规定“辅导学生升学”的许多条文，但是并没有实行，而且对于稍为进步的侨生，随意加上莫须有的罪名，进行逮捕。华侨出国要受到伪侨务处和外交机关的许多敲榨。比如在外交机关办出国手续，必须本人或直属亲戚才能办理，如果旁人代为办理，就要花许多钱；在伪侨务处领取一张出国证明书也要花到五元至十元的港币。所有这些，都造成华侨对伪政府的极端不满，因而近年来侨汇逐渐减少，华侨对于投资祖国经济建设失去兴趣和信心。
    广东解放后，人民政府对待华侨的政策和国民党反动派完全不同。人民政府根据共同纲领第五十八条规定“中华人民共和国中央人民政府应尽力保护国外华侨的正当权益”的精神，积极保护华侨的正当权益，成立华侨事务委员会（下称侨委会），专门为华侨服务。
    促进侨汇回国，维持侨眷的生活，是华侨服务工作中最主要的一项。全省侨眷依靠侨汇维持生活的占很大的数量，从侨委会在侨区的典型调查里可以清楚看出来。如粤中区台山县第三区横岗山村，全村人口三一二人，其中华侨及其眷属二一一人，占全村人口百分之六七·六。侨眷依靠侨汇供给全年生活的占百分之四一·四八，依靠侨汇供给全年生活八成以上者占百分之一四·七，依靠侨汇供给全年生活六成以上者占百分之一二·二，合计依靠侨汇供给全年生活的侨眷占全村侨户二一一人的百分之六八·三。潮汕区潮安县第八区刘龙村，全村三二二户，其中侨眷一二五户，占全村户数百分之三四·五三。侨眷生活依靠侨汇维持者占百分之七二·五，依靠土地生活者占百分之二一·六，依靠其他生活者占百分之五·八。由此可见侨汇与侨眷的生活是息息相关，促进侨汇回国非常重要。
    但是，在促进侨汇回国的初期即去年十一月至今年三月间，曾经遇到若干困难。当时全国金融物价尚未稳定，侨汇保值尚有困难。而各地在征粮、收税及推销公债等工作中，干部掌握政策也有一些偏差（如在征粮中，有些地方的干部看见侨汇多的侨眷，就把他们当作地主来征收），引起华侨的不满。那时海南岛尚未解放，匪特多方造谣。这一切使华侨对于汇款回国有许多顾虑，侨汇的数字比解放前四年每月均有减少。
    但是从今年四月开始，侨汇的颓势逐渐被扭转过来。广州人民银行四月份一个月收进的侨汇，即超过该行前三个月收进的总额百分之四十五强，五月收进的侨汇比四月增加百分之三八，六月收进的侨汇比五月增加百分之二二。潮汕人民银行四月份收进的侨汇，达到抗战前最盛时期的饱和点，台山、新城两地人民银行四月份收进的侨汇比去年十二月至今年三月的四个月中每月的平均数增加百分之一百四十以上。惠州人民银行四月份收进的侨汇比三月份几乎增加百分之一百。五六月份各地侨汇均在激增中。侨汇好转的基本原因，首先是全国财经统一，金融物价稳定，人民银行定出合理和统一的侨汇牌价，侨汇的保值问题基本上得到解决。同时侨委会经常向人民银行反映侨眷对侨汇的意见，人民银行实行优待侨汇的许多办法（如原币汇款，及汇款豁免手续费等）。另外政府对侨批业实行“外汇归公，利润归私”的公私兼顾的政策，鼓励和引导侨批业走上正当道路。其次，政府逐渐纠正征粮，税收及推销公债等工作的偏向，侨委会配合这一工作在侨眷中进行各种宣传解释，消除华侨的不满心理。同时海南岛解放，稳定了广东局面，粉碎了匪特所造的谣言。由于上述原因，侨眷逐渐了解政府保护侨汇的政策，纷纷写信到海外叫寄款回来。
    侨汇的好转，使广大侨眷在春荒时期的生活困难逐渐得到解决。
    解决侨产的长期纠纷，是华侨对人民政府的迫切要求。数月来，侨委会从广州开始积极进行这一工作。侨产纠纷的内容及处理的办法，主要的有下面几类：（一）解放时，空屋被机关部队借用者，有十三宗，已全部处理解决，解决的办法是：要求机关部队限期搬走，损坏的东西一律赔偿。如屋主愿意出租，机关部队可以租住。（二）解放前房屋租与反动分子，解放后因不明屋主而暂由人民政府代管者，有九宗，已处理解决了三宗，解决的办法是：调查清楚，物归原主。（三）房屋被人强占者，有九宗，已处理解决者七宗，解决的办法是：调查确实，物归原主。（四）普通租贷纠纷，有三十八宗，已处理解决者三十四宗，解决的办法是：由侨委会协助屋主与对方讲理，使对方按期交租。由于侨委会公允的处理侨产纠纷，侨眷提请处理侨产纠纷的日益增多。目前侨委会和人民法院、地政局、公逆产清管处、归侨联谊会等共同组织侨产纠纷调解委员会，以人民法院为主，专门负责调解工作。这样，对于统一集中力量迅速解决问题有很大作用。
    随着东南亚的民族解放运动的蓬勃开展，帝国主义对殖民地的统治日益凶残，华侨的处境日益恶化。遭受帝国主义迫害、失去求学自由的广大华侨学生，纷纷投归祖国怀抱。人民政府积极协助他们升学，要把他们培养成新中国的建设人材。侨委会介绍他们投考各种学校，计往北京投考学校的有一百四十二名，在广州市投考学校的有八十三名，介绍到南方大学学习的有七十二名。目前南方大学因校舍建筑尚未竣工，尚有一百名侨生住在侨委会的招待所等候投考。侨委会鉴于侨生在升学中有些特殊困难，建议政府订定优待侨生回国就学暂行办法（如考试有二三科不及格者，准予插入相当学级，随班肄业，并帮助其补修不及格之科目。家庭贫寒的侨生，可以取得人民助学金）。该办法已于六月份公布实行。
    在广东实行土地改革以前，对于华侨土地问题进行调查研究，以便土改时根据各地具体情况，适当处理，这是华侨服务工作中的一件很重要的事情。为此，侨委会于三月初即派人往著名侨区潮汕区召集当地归国华侨开土地问题座谈会，初步了解该区土地情况。四月间，侨委会与中共华南分局研究室联合邀请暹罗华侨回国观光团举行华侨土地问题座谈会，并与该团共同派遣土地调查组前往粤中、东江、珠江、潮汕四大侨区作实地调查工作。五月底，侨委会又派出四个土地调查组到兴（宁）梅（县）区、潮汕区、东江区、粤中区、珠江区、海南区六大侨区进行重点典型调查，预计七月底可以全部完成土地调查研究工作。
    目前归侨日多，华侨服务工作逐渐繁重，仅依靠政府的侨务机构（即侨委会），很难把工作搞好，因此在侨委会的建议与协助下，五月底成立了归侨联谊会广东总分会筹备委员会，各地的同样的组织亦正在建立。归侨联谊会的服务内容就是团结归侨，联系海外华侨，及时反映华侨对政府的意见和要求，成为联系政府与华侨的桥梁。
    半年来，广东的侨务工作正在逐渐开展。但还存在着一个很大的缺点，就是侨务机构不健全，除省级有侨务机构（即侨委会）外，大部分的专署和县没有侨务机构，许多工作不能推动下去。比如，组织侨眷参加生产救灾，是侨委会半年来的中心工作之一，但是因为缺乏下层机构，侨委会只能做到一般号召，未能做到和各级政府配合起来有重点的参加具体领导。
    做好华侨服务工作，就是做好团结国内千万侨眷和国外千万华侨的工作。而团结华侨是与团结东南亚和美洲一带的和平民主力量有密切的关系的。因此，今天迅速健全侨务机构，做好华侨服务工作，非常重要。
    七月二十六日于广州
