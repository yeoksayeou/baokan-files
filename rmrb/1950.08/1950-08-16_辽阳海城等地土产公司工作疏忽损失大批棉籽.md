　　Negligence at Local Produce Companies in Liaoyang, Haicheng, and Other Areas Leads to Loss of Large Quantities of Cottonseed

　　Editor:

　　Due to a lack of experience in storing cottonseed, coupled with negligence in their work, the Liaoyang, Haicheng, and Dashiqiao produce departments under the Liaodong Province Produce Company failed to ventilate and stir the stockpiles in time, resulting in the spoilage of 497 tons of cottonseed and a loss of 1.98 billion yuan (Northeast currency). This included 68 tons in storage in Liaoyang and 392 tons in Haicheng, all of which spoiled. In Dashiqiao, 37 tons spoiled, accounting for one-third of the inventory.

　　The fundamental reason for the losses was the lack of experience in storing cottonseed in various locations. Last winter, the cottonseed was stockpiled in the courtyard without inspection. In January and February of this year, the custodians believed that the weather was still cold and it would not spoil. By March, various locations successively discovered spoilage. For example, in Liaoyang, some of the cottonseed was rained on when it was put into storage last winter. It was not until March of this year that the stockpiles were opened for inspection, but it had already completely spoiled. The Haicheng Produce Department was even more negligent, only starting the inspection in May. In reality, the cottonseed had already spoiled, but the comrade responsible for storage in the Produce Department still believed that it had not spoiled and continued to stir the stockpiles. In addition, the Produce Department had two stockpiles of cottonseed processed this year that had already spoiled, but it was not discovered until the district company sent people to receive the cottonseed in June. The Dashiqiao cottonseed inventory was inspected in March, and one-third was found to be spoiled (after continuous stirring, the remaining two-thirds were not lost).

　　When purchasing seed cotton in the above three locations last year, no attention was paid to specifications, and damp seed cotton was accepted. In addition, the cottonseed was immature and had a high moisture content, and was not ventilated, resulting in spoilage due to heat.

　　After a preliminary inspection by the Northeast District Produce Company, the Liaodong Province Produce Company has been notified to conduct a more thorough inspection in order to gain experience, educate cadres, and give the responsible personnel the punishment they deserve.

### 辽阳海城等地土产公司工作疏忽损失大批棉籽

　　辽阳海城等地土产公司工作疏忽损失大批棉籽
　　编辑同志：
    辽东省土产公司所属辽阳、海城、大石桥三地土产部，因缺乏保管棉籽的经验，加以工作上麻痹疏忽，未及时通风捣囤，使四百九十七吨棉籽变质，损失十九亿八千万元（东北币）。其中计辽阳库存六十八吨，海城库存三百九十二吨，全部变质。大石桥有三十七吨变质，占库存三分之一。
    造成损失的基本原因，是各地对棉籽缺乏保管经验。去年冬季把棉籽囤在院中未加检查，今年一、二月保管人认为天气尚冷不会坏，到三月间各地遂陆续发现变质。如辽阳在去年冬季入囤时，部分棉籽被雨淋，直到今年三月始开囤检查，但已经全部变质。海城土产部更是麻痹，迟至五月份才着手检查，实际棉籽早已变质，而该土产部负责保管的同志，还认为没有变质，仍然捣囤。此外，该土产部还有本年加工出的棉籽两囤，已经变质，但一直等到六月区公司派人接收棉籽时，才发现棉籽全部变质。大石桥库存棉籽，三月份开囤检查时有三分之一变质（经以后继续捣囤，其余三分之二未遭损失）。
    以上三地在去年收购籽棉时，未注意规格，把潮湿的籽棉都收进来，加以棉籽不成熟，水分大，未经过通风，遂因发热造成损失。
    以上情况经东北区土产公司派人初步检查后，已通知辽东省土产公司再作彻底检查，以便得出经验，教育干部，并给失职人员以应得的处分。
