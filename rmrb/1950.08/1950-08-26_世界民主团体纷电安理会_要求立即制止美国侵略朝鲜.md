Xinhua News Agency, August 25th: TASS reports a compilation of messages: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the Presidium of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee, the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front, the Bulgarian General Trade Union, the People's Women's League and the Democratic Youth League, the Council of Trade Unions of the Hungarian People's Republic, the Union of Laboring Peasants and Agricultural Workers, the Labor Youth League and the Democratic Women's League, the National Front Committee of the Capital of the German Democratic Republic (Berlin), and the Russian Orthodox Church, have all sent telegrams to the United Nations Security Council, unanimously demanding that the Security Council immediately stop American aggression against Korea, unconditionally prohibit the inhumane American bombing of peaceful Korean cities and villages and the international atrocities of massacring unarmed civilians, and order all foreign troops to withdraw from Korea.
	The World Federation of Democratic Youth, representing 70 million members, protested against the brutal American bombing and urged all its affiliated organizations to strongly declare their firm protest against such atrocities, demanding that the Security Council listen to the opinions of relevant representatives from both sides with the participation of representatives from the five major powers, and immediately begin a peaceful resolution to the Korean question. In its telegram to the Security Council, the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee pointed out that the barbaric actions of the United States in Korea have aroused deep anger in the hearts of all those who cherish freedom and national independence. Soviet youth support the Soviet government's policy of peacefully resolving the Korean question and believe that the Korean people themselves must decide the needs of their motherland. The telegram from the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences condemned the American aggressors for destroying the fruits of thousands of years of Korean people's culture and precious cultural relics, massacring defenseless old people, women, and children, and condemned the imperialists for using great scientific achievements to serve their criminal purposes. In its telegram, the National Committee of the Bulgarian Fatherland Front stated: "American imperialism is exterminating thousands upon thousands of women and children in Korea on a large scale, which has surpassed Hitler's atrocities in Europe." The working people of one hundred and seventy-six enterprises in Berlin passed a resolution protesting the barbaric massacre of Korean old people, women, and children by American imperialists.
