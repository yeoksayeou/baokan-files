Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th. Shaanxi Province in the Northwest region held county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings in most areas before the start of the summer grain collection work, initially rectifying the cadre style to ensure the smooth progress of the summer grain collection work. Six districts including Weinan, Xianyang, Baoji, Shangluo, Hanzhong, and Ankang, with a total of more than sixty counties, convened county, district, and township three-level cadre meetings in June, focusing on reviewing the bureaucratic and commandist styles of work in their leadership, and specifically discussing and deploying the summer grain collection work. The meetings in various places conducted detailed discussions and deployments for this year's summer grain collection work. In order to closely integrate the rectification and summer grain collection work, the meetings in various places required cadres at all levels to widely publicize policies in the summer grain collection work, to accurately assess land, estimate yields, and determine class status based on raising the political awareness of the masses, and to correct the simplistic task-completion viewpoint of some cadres who are impatient, rigid, and disregard policies, as well as the resulting commandist work style.
