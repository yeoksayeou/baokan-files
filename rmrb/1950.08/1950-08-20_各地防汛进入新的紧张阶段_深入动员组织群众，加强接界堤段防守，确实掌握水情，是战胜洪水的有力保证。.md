　　Flood Prevention in Various Regions Enters a New Stage of Tension
    Thoroughly Mobilizing and Organizing the Masses, Strengthening the Defense of Border Dike Sections, and Accurately Grasping Water Conditions are Powerful Guarantees for Overcoming Floods.
    [Report from this newspaper] Meng Xin of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government reports: The summer flood season has passed, and the autumn flood season is approaching. Flood prevention agencies along all rivers in the country are entering a new stage of intense flood prevention, redoubling their efforts to fight for the final victory over the floods.
    During this year's summer flood season, except for northern Anhui, which suffered severe disasters due to excessive flooding, other regions have achieved great success under the united efforts of the entire Party, government, army, and people. They have protected the lives and property of millions of people and gained many experiences and lessons, which are very important for future flood prevention.
    First, to overcome floods, it is necessary to thoroughly mobilize the masses and have sufficient material preparations to ensure timely rescue and avoid disasters. In the leadership of Meiqiao District, Huaiyuan County, northern Anhui, during this emergency prevention of the Huai River, in-depth mobilization and persuasive education were carried out among the masses. The masses actively participated in the rescue, enabling the critical dangerous works to overcome the difficulties. In the Huainan Bagongshan mining area, since the Huai River rose on July 10 and the dike section was in urgent danger, the mine's employees, government personnel, troops, and Youth League units worked day and night to block the breaches under heavy rain, and the timely supply of materials finally protected the mine and the safety of nearby rural areas. There are many such facts. However, in some areas, flood prevention organizations are merely a formality. For example, in Guangxu District of Huaining County along the Yangtze River in northern Anhui, because the township and village cadres did not carry out in-depth publicity and mobilization, but only temporarily dealt with the instructions from higher authorities, they pulled in old people in their fifties and sixties and children of sixteen or seventeen years old to make up the numbers for the rescue teams. In Cheluo District, Gaoyou County, northern Jiangsu, no mobilization preparations for flood prevention were made until July 26. After the emergency flood prevention task was assigned on the 27th, no publicity or mobilization was carried out among the masses. A few people were unwilling to go to the dikes, and Yang Xulu, the township head of the district, did not patiently persuade the masses, but instead beat and scolded them, forcing them to go to the dikes. These are extremely harmful to flood prevention work. At present, flood prevention agencies in various regions have begun to pay attention to correcting this deviation. For example, Nanjing City along the Yangtze River, Pingyuan Province along the Yellow River, Tianjin Prefecture in Hebei Province, and Suxian Prefecture in northern Anhui have all paid attention to thoroughly mobilizing the masses, organizing and improving grassroots flood prevention agencies, and mobilizing the masses to widely prepare flood prevention materials, which provides a strong guarantee for future flood prevention.
    Second, the backbone role of cadres, Communist Party members, and Youth League members is very important in flood prevention. In Huiliuji Township, Fuyang, northern Anhui, on the evening of July 13, the Shahe River rose sharply, and it was about to breach. Using doors and wheat straw bundles to block the breach was ineffective, and the situation was extremely urgent. Cadre Ma Jixun led a dozen militiamen to bravely jump into the water and persisted in working in the wind and rain for three hours, finally turning the crisis into safety. Fan Jinsheng, the branch secretary of Dumu Township, Zhoujiaji District, Huoqiu County, northern Anhui, insisted on the dike for three days and nights when the Huai River rose in early July, mobilizing and encouraging the masses to protect the river embankment. In the Xianghe section of the Chaobai River New Channel in Hebei Province, the water勢猛rose sharply on July 17, and the embankment collapsed. When a breach was discovered, the situation was urgent. Communist Party member Wang Qijiang led other Party members and Youth League members to go into the water one after another, leading 6,000 laborers to actively drive piles and hang willows, and finally avoided the danger. There are many such heroic deeds. Especially in times of emergency, the backbone role of cadres, Party members, and Youth League members is very effective in stabilizing the emotions of the masses and enhancing confidence in defense.
    In addition, the People's Liberation Army in various regions has assisted the masses in rescuing and repairing embankments, and has also achieved great results. After the Huaihe Dike at Zhengyangguan in northern Anhui was flooded, soldiers of a certain brigade assisted in rescuing the Paihe Dike; a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army marched fifty miles at rapid speed to rescue the dangerous works in the Yuekou section of the Han River. On August 9, a dangerous situation occurred on the Yongding River in Daxing County, Hebei Province, at Nanzhangke, with 60 zhang of embankment collapsing and overflowing. The masses lost confidence and dispersed several times, but after a battalion of a certain division arrived, they actively carried out rescue and finally turned the danger into safety.
    Third, strengthening special telecommunications equipment for flood prevention and accurately grasping water conditions is an important key to doing a good job in flood prevention. The first four floods of the Yongding River were all due to timely contact with water conditions, and the ability to estimate in advance when the flood peak would arrive and how high the water level might rise, thus overcoming the floods. However, the Huai River flood was due to poor contact with water conditions upstream and downstream, and the sudden arrival of the flood peak, which caught people off guard, resulting in many culverts failing to close in time, and the breach of the inner water failing to be blocked in time, resulting in disasters.
    Fourth, attention should be paid to the defense work of the joint defense zone or the dike section at the junction of the two defense zones. The Central Flood Control Headquarters issued instructions on the issue of joint defense in June, and various regions have also attached great importance to this. However, in the previous stage of flood prevention work, many problems were still discovered. For example, the Tongma Dike on the Yangtze River is jointly defended by the joint defense headquarters composed of eastern China, northern Anhui, and central and southern Hubei, but individual cadres in the headquarters still have some deviations in their understanding of the unified grasp of the situation upstream and downstream and the true realization of unified leadership. For example, during the third flood of the Yongding River in Hebei, the flood prevention headquarters of Anci County mostly focused its attention on defending dangerous works and paid less attention to the newly built Longhe South Dike. The old breach at the junction of Anci and Gu'an was changing, but Anci did not take the initiative to inquire with Gu'an, and Gu'an did not notify Anci in time, resulting in the breach of Nanhan. Therefore, the contact and mutual support should be strengthened for the defense of the joint defense zone or the dike section at the junction. If an attitude of mutual evasion or sitting idly by is adopted, it will inevitably lead to adverse consequences.
    Finally, complacency and carelessness are the greatest enemies in flood prevention work. Failure to carefully inspect the dikes, failure to thoroughly mobilize and organize manpower, failure to fully prepare materials, blindly optimistic, or treating flood prevention work with a bureaucratic attitude are extremely harmful. For example, the Hunhe and Taizi Rivers in eastern Liaoning, Northeast China, breached in several places in late July, submerging more than 25,000 hectares of fertile land. The Xisha River in western Liaoning Province also breached on July 20, submerging more than 2,000 hectares of farmland. The main reason was complacency in flood prevention work and neglect of dike inspection. This lesson is extremely painful. At present, the major flood season of the Yellow River has not yet arrived, and flood prevention work in some areas still remains at the district level and has not been deployed downwards. Some cadres and the masses have extremely harmful complacency, and although the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has pointed out and corrected this, it should still be paid close attention to and overcome in actual work.

　　各地防汛进入新的紧张阶段
    深入动员组织群众，加强接界堤段防守，  确实掌握水情，是战胜洪水的有力保证。
    【本报讯】中央人民政府水利部孟新报道：夏汛已过，秋汛即到，全国各江河防汛机构进入新的紧张防汛阶段，再接再厉，为最后战胜洪水而斗争。
    今年夏汛，除皖北因洪水过大，造成严重灾害外，其他地区，在全体党政军民的一致努力下，已取得很大成绩，保障了千万人民的生命财产，并取得了很多经验教训，这对今后防汛是非常重要的。
    第一、要战胜洪水，只有深入动员群众，并有充足的物料准备，才能抢险及时，避免成灾。皖北怀远县梅桥区领导上，在这次抢防淮水时，对群众进行了深入的动员说服教育，群众都积极投入了抢险，使危急的险工度过了难关。淮南八公山矿区，自七月十日淮水上涨，堤段告急后，由于该矿员工、政府人员、部队、青年团等单位，在大雨的袭击下昼夜抢堵，及材料的供应及时，终于保护了矿场及附近农村的安全。这样的事实是很多的。但也有的地区，防汛组织流于形式。例如长江沿岸皖北怀宁县的广圩区，由于乡、村干部未深入宣传动员，只是临时应付上级指示，把五六十岁的老人和十六七岁的小孩子都拉入抢险队凑数。苏北高邮县车逻区至七月二十六日对防汛尚未作动员准备，二十七日防汛紧急任务布置下来后，对群众不进行宣传动员，少数群众不愿上堤，该区乡长杨旭辂不耐心说服群众，反而打骂群众，强迫上堤。这些对防汛工作都是极端有害的。目前各地防汛机构已开始注意纠正这种偏向。例如长江沿岸的南京市、黄河沿岸的平原省以及河北省的天津专区、皖北的宿县专区均已注意深入动员群众，组织健全下层防汛机构，发动群众广泛准备防汛器材，这给今后防汛提供了有力保证。
    第二、干部和共产党员、青年团员的骨干作用，在防汛中非常重要。皖北阜阳洄溜集乡，七月十三日傍晚，沙河水陡涨，眼看就要决口，用门板、麦秸捆抢堵无效，情况万分紧急，干部马继勋带领十几个民兵，英勇跳下水中，在狂风暴雨中坚持了三个钟头工作，终于转危为安。皖北霍邱县周家集区杜母乡的支部书记范金生，七月上旬淮河涨水时，在堤上接连坚持三昼夜，动员鼓舞群众抢护河堤。河北省潮白河新河道香河段，七月十七日水势猛涨，堤岸坍塌，发现漏洞，情况紧急，中共党员王其江率领其他党员、团员相继下水，带动六千民工积极打桩挂柳，终未成险。这种英勇事迹是很多的，尤其在紧急关头，干部、党、团员的骨干作用，对稳定群众情绪，增强防守信心，效用很大。
    此外各地人民解放军协助群众抢险补堤，也获得了巨大成绩。皖北正阳关淮堤浸水后，某旅战士协助抢护渒河堤防；四野某部以五十里急行军赶救汉水岳口段险工，河北省永定河于八月九日在大兴县南张客发生险象，有六十丈堤段坍塌漫水，群众失掉信心，几次哄散，但在某师一营赶到后，积极进行抢护，终于化险为夷。
    第三、加强防汛专用电讯设备，确实掌握水情，是作好防汛工作的一个重要关键。永定河前四次涨水，都由于水情联系及时，事前能够估计洪峰何时到达，水位可能涨多高，因而战胜洪水。但淮河涨水，则由于上下游水情联系差，洪峰骤来，猝不及防，演成很多涵闸不及关闭，排内水决口不及堵筑而冲决成灾。
    第四、应注意联防区或两防区交界堤段的防守工作。中央防汛总指挥部曾于六月间发出关于联防问题的指示，各地对此亦颇重视。但在上一阶段的防汛工作中，仍发现不少问题。如长江同马大堤由华东皖北与中南湖北组成联防指挥部共同防守，但该指挥部仍有个别干部，对上下游统一掌握情况，真正作到统一领导，认识上存在着若干偏差。又如河北永定河第三次涨水，安次县防汛指挥部多半集中注意力于防守险工，对新修之龙河南堤注意较少，安次、固安接合部的旧决口，溜势变化，安次未向固安主动了解，固安亦未及时通知安次，因而发生南汉决口。因此对联防区或接界堤段的防守，急应加强联系，互相支援，若采取互相推诿、或坐视旁观的态度，必致造成不良后果。
    最后，麻痹大意是防汛工作中的最大敌人。对堤防不认真检查，对人力不深入动员组织，对物料不充分准备，一味盲目乐观，或用官僚主义态度对待防汛工作，这是极端有害的。例如东北辽东的浑河、太子河，在七月下旬数处决口，淹没良田二万五千多垧，辽西省西沙河亦在七月二十日决口，淹没田地二千多垧，主要原因即是对防汛工作麻痹，疏于检查堤防，这种教训异常惨痛。目前黄河大汛尚未到来，部分地区防汛工作仍停留在区级，未能往下布置，某些干部、群众存在极端有害的麻痹思想，虽经黄河防汛总指挥部指出纠正，但仍应很好注意，使其在实际工作中予以克服。
