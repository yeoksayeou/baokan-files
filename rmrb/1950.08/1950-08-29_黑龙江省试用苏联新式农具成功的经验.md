　　Successful Experiences in Heilongjiang Province with New Soviet Agricultural Implements
　　Jin Langbai
　　This year, Heilongjiang Province has a total of eighteen sets of complete new Soviet agricultural implements, loaned to typical mutual aid teams in ten counties, including Keshan and Nehe, for centralized trial use. In addition, there are 970 single units, most of which were loaned to demonstration farms in various counties for trial use. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry also provided three sets, loaned to mutual aid teams in Keshan and Zhaoyuan, while the rest were placed in耕作stations in Keshan and Nehe for farmers to rent. Since the launch of this work in 1950, the leadership at the provincial and county levels has first attached importance to this work and tightened the leadership of the mutual aid teams. Therefore, these teams have gained some experience and achieved initial success. Through practical trial use, difficulties in thinking and operation have been overcome. These experiences can be summarized as follows:
　　(1) Centralized trial use, outstanding benefits, easy to grasp and lead. 1. Only centralized trial use of new agricultural implements can give full play to their role, and the benefits to the masses can be prominent. Obviously, after preliminary calculations, such as in the thirteen groups in Beixing District and Beilian in Keshan County, due to the concentrated allocation, each group can reclaim an average of 27 hectares of wasteland, increasing income by more than 250 million yuan, and each labor force can harvest 10.95 shi of grain more, allowing farmers to clearly see the benefits of new agricultural implements. 2. It is convenient for leadership and care. For example, Keshan currently has twenty-four complete and semi-complete sets of new agricultural implements, which have been distributed to farmers in eight villages in four districts as a priority. The two villages of Xihe are neighboring villages, and the villages in Beixing and Beilian districts are also very close to each other, with a maximum distance of no more than 19 li, which makes it easier to grasp in leadership. 3. Agricultural implements must be used in conjunction, but in some counties, some only lend out double-wheeled single-铧plows, some only lend double-wheeled single-铧plows and nail-tooth harrows, and others only lend out harvesters without sowing machines, or some are returned. This is not appropriate because these three agricultural implements must be used in conjunction; without the first two, the sowing machine becomes useless.
　　Judging from the experience gained from the above concentrated use, it confirms that the "priority trial use" proposed by the Northeast People's Government is entirely correct.
　　(2) Have a firm attitude to promote, master the technology, provide specific leadership, and cadres should personally do it to set an example.
　　Currently, farmers are skeptical about the effectiveness of new agricultural implements and are nostalgic for old agricultural implements. People in various places have different views on new agricultural implements. Some people say that the sowing machine is not easy to use before they have seen or tried it, saying things like, "It's not as reliable as the old agricultural implements!" Others complain about the trouble, saying, "This screw, that pin, it's not as easy to use as the old agricultural implements!" Some who haven't seen it say, "How can you install this thing with its fangs and claws? It's dazzling at first sight!" "One piece is red, another is green, if you put it on the horse, won't it get angry!" Some people worry that new agricultural implements are expensive and fear they can't afford them, so they shout "can use" but don't actually use them, or even return the agricultural implements, or borrow them back in the name of one group and distribute them to two or three groups or the whole village for decentralized use, sharing the price equally. This makes it impossible for the outstanding role of new agricultural implements to be brought into play. Therefore, the leadership's thinking on the use of new agricultural implements should have strong confidence. For example, Keshan regards this work as a political task that "can only succeed and must not fail." Raise awareness, overcome doubts, boldly try it out, affirm that new agricultural implements are easy to use, and increase the confidence of cadres and the masses. Five county committee comrades in Keshan personally gained experience, two agricultural section chiefs focused on specific leadership, and initially learned the technology, carrying pliers and hammers to the countryside to help the masses install and disassemble, and assigned four technical cadres to live in the new agricultural implement groups regularly. Under such a leadership style of personally doing it at the county and district levels, a series of problems were solved, experience was gradually explored, the ideological understanding of cadres and the masses was improved, and the effectiveness of the agricultural implements was brought into play. For example, when the hay rake was being tested, each unit reached a record of raking eight to eleven carts a day. This influenced farmers to compete for more. The harvester has also achieved success in trial use, increasing the confidence of the masses. For example, Liu, an old man in Taiping Village, Beixing District, initially wanted to withdraw from the new agricultural implement group. When he saw that it was easy to use, he immediately insisted on joining. He was afraid of damaging the new agricultural implement and told the young men, "If it's easy to use, hurry back, cutting firewood is a small matter, leaving it to harvest the land in the fall is a big deal." When he saw it getting muddy, he also took a willow branch to "clip" it off. The double-wheeled single-铧plow has also been successfully tested and is very easy for farmers to use. In addition, corn threshers, hand-cranked chaff cutters...etc., have also been tested and achieved results. The sowing machine in Soviet agricultural implements, which was considered "not easy to use," has also achieved its due role after bold use in Fuyuan Village in Nehe County, Fuxing Village and Minli Village in Keshan, the Qiwen Group in Tao'an, and under the personal trial use of Deputy County Chief He of Suihua.
　　In addition, there should be sufficient understanding of the effectiveness of new agricultural implements: (1) New agricultural implements can liberate farmers from old agricultural implements, and farmers can accept the use of new agricultural implements from the experience of painful labor. For example, Liu Youlin, who drives the hay rake in Taiping Village, Beixing District, Keshan, said when he returned from the meadow: "This thing is really easy to use, it's comfortable to sit on, people don't feel tired, and horses don't even sweat." Li Yongtai, a cadre in the district, also saw the point, saying: "In the future, when there are more new agricultural implements, even women who can't go to the fields can sit and drive!" For example, at a symposium for new agricultural implement group leaders in Keshan, after Wang Guangcai of Taiping Village, Beixing, introduced the effectiveness of the hay rake, another villager immediately took off his clothes and pointed to his shoulders, saying: "Look, I'm raking the big rake, my shoulders are all broken!" (2) New agricultural implements can improve productivity, produce more grain, and increase income. From the plan of the thirteen groups in Beixing and Beilian, Keshan, the use of new agricultural implements to reclaim 354 hectares of wasteland accounts for 42.35 percent of the cultivated land area, producing 1,686 shi of grain, worth 3,251.1 million yuan. On average, each group reclaims 27 hectares of wasteland, and each group can increase its income by 250 million yuan on average, and each labor force can harvest 10.95 shi of grain more. (3) New agricultural implements themselves have yield-increasing properties. For example, the double-wheeled single-铧plow turns the soil evenly and deeply, and the sowing machine can increase five seedlings in an area of two and a half ridges, giving full play to the land's potential. In cultivated land, a sowing machine with four horses and two people can plant six hectares of wheat a day, saving ten man-days and two horse-days per six hectares compared to 対犁; saving twelve man-days and eight horse-days compared to single镬子. A harvester with four horses and seven people can harvest five hectares of wheat a day, while it takes five people a day to harvest one hectare with a sickle, saving twelve man-days in five hectares. In addition, a hay rake can rake eight to eleven carts a day, equivalent to eight to eleven man-days. From the whole year's perspective, the use of new agricultural implements can not only ensure timely farming and rapid completion of cultivation tasks, but also leave a lot of labor to participate in sideline production, increasing more income.
　　New agricultural implements have been successfully used in the Soviet Union for many years and have been promoted in the Soviet Union for a long time. They are no longer new agricultural implements in the Soviet Union, but they are called new agricultural implements here because they are being used for the first time.
　　Facts have proved that to do this work well, cadres must master the technology, do it themselves, provide specific guidance, and set an example. This is the key issue for the success or failure of trial use of new Soviet agricultural implements. Leading cadres in county governments, agricultural sections, districts, and villages should all learn the technology of using new agricultural implements, delve into the production process to learn and explore experience and problems. This is the best way to avoid being at a loss when the masses shout "not easy to use." For example, the Wang Zhijian and Zhuang Mingsheng new agricultural implement groups in Nehe County, under the personal guidance of the county chief and county secretary and the agricultural section chief, raised the confidence of the masses under the personal leadership of labor model Wang Zhijian, branch secretary Zhang Shuqing, and organization committee member Song Defu, who insisted on trial use. In particular, with the support of the county chief and county secretary of Nehe, the ditching devices of the twelve sowing machines were modified by installing small 铧, which solved the problem of ridge cultivation. Deputy County Chief He of Suihua's personal involvement and the mastery of technology by five county committee comrades in Keshan all achieved results. Hailun and Baiquan also made achievements under the involvement of the county secretary and county chief. Therefore, these regions not only gained experience in leadership, but also strengthened the confidence of the masses in the groups in trial use. On the contrary, some cadres neither understand the technology nor delve into research, and are at a loss when they encounter difficulties, so the work cannot be done well.
　　Trial use of new agricultural implements is a new thing, and it requires a arduous struggle process. It is difficult to absorb experience and succeed without hard work. Some counties thought it was easy and did not seize the time to lead personally, so they ran around with the masses. When they heard the masses say, "Not easy to use," they also said, "I don't think it can be easy to use!" In addition, some counties, although they wanted to do well, lacked technology and had no specific guidance methods, so they wavered in their confidence in using new agricultural implements due to the influence of farmers' conservative thinking and drought, and did not dare to boldly try it out.
　　(3) Determine the form of the group according to the role of the agricultural implements. The size of the group cannot be determined by the wishes of the leadership or the emotions of the masses. If the group is too large and there are too many people, the thinking is inconsistent, the opinions are not unified, it is not easy to lead, and new and old agricultural implements are mixed, and old agricultural implements affect new agricultural implements, and their effectiveness cannot be fully发挥. At the same time, if the group is large and there is too much land, it will exceed the effectiveness of the new agricultural implements, and the benefits will not be much, and it will not be easy to succeed. Therefore, the large group of 28 households and more than 30 horses and labor forces in Yang Xianting of Beixing District, Keshan County, was only suitable after transformation, and Yang Xianting also increased his leadership confidence. However, if the group is too small, the conditions such as labor and land will limit the full发挥of the effectiveness of new agricultural implements, and the burden will be too heavy, which may lead to losses, and it will be even more difficult to succeed.
　　General experience is that a group with 12 or 13 labor forces, 13 or 14 horsepower, and about 100 hectares of land is more suitable.
　　(4) A two-benefit system must be established on the basis of private ownership. Beware of blurring the private ownership policy and prevent the occurrence of egalitarianism. Due to the use of new agricultural implements, the relations of production and organizational forms are gradually changing, so some places have seen the phenomenon of preparing to organize partnership groups, jointly working and sharing, and forcibly merging large groups. In terms of consumption and financial power, the private ownership policy has been seriously blurred, and even leaving and joining the group has lost personal freedom, which violates the policy of "developing production on the basis of private ownership." Such organizational forms should be thoroughly persuaded and corrected, and a reasonable two-benefit system should be formulated. Judging from the experience of Keshan, Nehe, Hailun, Baiquan and other counties, the following practices are more appropriate:
　　1. Clarify that the ownership of new agricultural implements is private; the whole set of agricultural implements is made into several shares, and all members of the group privately own shares. As far as the current situation is concerned, it is impossible to attribute the entire set of new agricultural implements to one person, and it is also impossible to separate the entire set and determine which one belongs to which person. Because the performance of new agricultural implements themselves must be used in conjunction, and no one can take and use any one separately. For example, if you use a sowing machine to plant land, you cannot shovel without leaving the shovel and leveling machine, and if you lack a double-wheeled single-铧plow, the sowing machine will not plant well. Among them, such as wasteland plows and nail-tooth harrows, although they can be taken away and used separately, they will not fully发挥their due role. Moreover, it will affect the inability to use the entire set of agricultural implements. Secondly, under the current economic burden capacity, labor quantity and intensity, land, livestock and other conditions of farmers, the effectiveness of the entire set of new agricultural implements cannot be发挥. Leaving the group should be free, but taking away its agricultural implements will affect the production of this group, and he himself will not produce well. Under such circumstances, new agricultural implements must be made into shares on the basis of private ownership and used jointly by all members of the group. It should be particularly noted here that the freedom of individuals to enter and leave the group should not be restricted as a whole because the ownership of agricultural implements belongs to all members of the group. Those who leave the group should be refunded appropriate agricultural implement funds according to the length of time they have been in the group, and those who join the group should also invest appropriate agricultural implement funds according to the length of time the agricultural implements have been used. On the other hand, the love of new agricultural implements should be done jointly by all members of the group, a warehouse for agricultural implements should be determined, a special person should be determined to take care of them, and whoever deliberately damages them should repair them, and the whole group should be responsible for repairing them if they are damaged during production.
　　2. Wasteland must be divided and归private, divided equally according to the manpower and horsepower spent, or allocated according to personal needs, and then find the price of manpower, horses, and labor. The initial trial planting of cultivated land should not suffer losses either. If less grain is harvested, it should be filled in by wasteland by the whole group.
　　3. Various consumption should be reasonably负担. For example, oiling, repairing, and spare parts for new agricultural implements should not be shared equally, but the cost should be allocated according to which agricultural implement is used for which land.
　　4. The lease of agricultural implements must be agreed upon by the whole group. Determine the labor price for each item, because there is less trial planting of cultivated land in the first year, and the effectiveness of agricultural implements is surplus. Leasing should be promoted, which can not only increase income within the group, but also play a promotional role.
　　(5) Good groups must be selected and political leadership of the groups must be strengthened.
　　1. Select groups with a better foundation, and priority should be given to groups with more cadres, party members, and youth league members, with backbones and leadership, and the basic conditions should be strong manpower and horses, and the possibility of development. Generally, model groups are more suitable. In the leadership of the groups, there must be political work, because the trial use of new agricultural implements is still the beginning, and more or less doubts will exist among the masses. In this way, there must be backbone members in the group to take a firm attitude to take the lead and persuade ordinary group members to successfully try out new agricultural implements. For example, Zhuang Mingsheng's group in Nehe County had branch secretary Zhang Shuqing and organization committee member Song Fude playing a role; Yang Xianting's group in Keshan added deputy branch secretary Lü Fengcai as deputy group leader, and the group could be consolidated; in Baiquan, Zhong Weifu's group, Zhong Weifu himself was the deputy village chief and a branch committee member, so the group was relatively sound.
　　2. Make a good annual production plan for the group, and carefully consider the benefits of using new agricultural implements in the annual production, so that every member of the group clearly recognizes the benefits of using new agricultural implements and increases their confidence in using them. Yang Xianting, Chen Yanxu, and Ma Longqing in Keshan, Zhong Weifu and Wang Fu in Baiquan, and Wang Zhijian and Zhuang Mingsheng in Nehe, etc., after the leading cadres helped to make specific production increase plans, they clearly saw that using new agricultural implements saves labor and produces more work, can do fine plowing and meticulous cultivation, and reclaiming more wasteland will definitely produce more grain, and each hectare of cultivated land can produce four or five dou of grain more, each group reclaims 20 to 30 hectares of wasteland, and each hectare produces an average of four shi of grain. According to this calculation, each labor force will increase income by nine to twelve shi of grain compared to ordinary groups.
　　Overall, the current groups using new agricultural implements have three significant characteristics in agricultural production: A. Expanded the cultivated land area and improved productivity. For example, in Beixing District, Keshan County, the district reclaimed 814 hectares of wasteland, and the nine new agricultural implement groups alone reclaimed 354 hectares, accounting for 43% of the district. For example, in Wang Zhijian's group in Nehe, Wang Zhijian himself planted more than 9 hectares of land, more than double the effectiveness of ordinary labor. This year, each labor force in the group can harvest 55 shi of grain. B. Outstandingly achieved fine plowing and meticulous cultivation. Generally, new agricultural implement groups, due to successful trial use, realize that they save labor and horsepower, and have the confidence to do four shovelings and four hectares in this year's shoveling and leveling work. For example, Wang Zhijian's group in Nehe proposed a plan of five shovelings and five leveling, which far exceeds the three shovelings and three levelings of ordinary old plow groups. C. Increased the cultivated area of commercial grain. According to the situation of the five groups of Yang Xianting, Chen Yanxu, and Ma Longqing in Keshan, Zhuang Mingsheng in Nehe, and Zhong Weifu in Baiquan, this year a total of 259 hectares and 8 mu of wheat and soybeans were planted, accounting for 73% of the total cultivated land area of 355 hectares. Even like Zhong Weifu's group in Baiquan, commercial grain accounts for 103.6% of the original cultivated land area.
　　Judging from the three characteristics of new agricultural implements, it is completely certain that new agricultural implements will defeat old agricultural implements, produce more grain, and produce good grain.

　　黑龙江省试用苏联新式农具成功的经验
    金浪白
    今年黑龙江省共有成套的苏联新式农具十八套，贷到了克山、讷河等十县典型互助小组集中试用外；另有单件的九百七十台，绝大部分贷给了各县示范农场试用；另有农林部三套，贷给了克山、肇源二个互助小组，其余则放在克山、讷河二处耕作站为农民出租使用。在一九五○年展开这一工作以来，首先是从省县领导上重视了这一工作，抓紧对互助小组的领导。因此在这些小组中，摸到了一些经验，获得了初步成功。经过实地试用，克服了思想上和操作上的困难。这些经验归纳起来有以下几点。
    （一）集中试用，获利突出，便于掌握与领导。１、新农具集中试用才能发挥它的作用，群众获利才能突出。显而易见的，经过初步计算，如克山县北兴区、北联十三个组，由于分配的集中，每组平均能开荒二十七垧，能多收入二亿五千多万元，每个劳动力能多收十石九斗五升粮食，使农民明确的看到了新农具的好处。２、便于领导和照顾。如克山现有二十四个整套和半套的新农具，已有重点的发到四个区八个村的农民手里。西河两村是邻村，北兴、北联两区的村也都相靠很近，最多不超过十九里路，在领导上也就便于掌握。３、农具必须联系使用，但有些县份，一种是光贷出双轮一铧犁，一种是光贷双轮一铧犁和钉齿耙，另一种是光贷收割机，播种机没贷下去，或有的退回来，这是不适合的。因为这三件农具必须联系使用，没有前两种农具，播种机就成了废物。
    从上面的集中使用取得的经验来看，证实了东北人民政府提出的“重点试用”是完全正确的。
    （二）要有坚决推行的态度，掌握技术，具体领导，干部亲自动手做出样子。
    目前农民怀疑新农具效用，留恋旧农具。各地群众对新农具有不同的看法，有些人在没看到和没试用之前，就说播种机不好使，如说：“还不如旧农具保准！”还有的人嫌麻烦说：“这一个螺丝，那一个消，还不如旧农具顺手呢！”有的没看见过就说：“这玩艺张牙舞爪的咋按呀？一见就花大眼啦！”“一块红一块绿，马一套上马还不得毛啦！”还有群众顾虑新农具价钱贵，怕买不起，因之也就发生空喊“能用”实际不用，甚至把农具退回来的情况，或以一个小组的名义贷回分散给二、三个小组或全屯分散使用，大伙平摊价钱，这样就使得新农具的突出作用不能发挥出来。因此对新农具的使用，在领导思想上应具有坚强的信心。如克山把这一工作视为“只能成功，不许失败”的政治任务。提高认识，克服疑虑，大胆试用，肯定新农具好使，提高干部群众信心。克山县五个县委同志亲自摸经验，两个农业科长着重具体领导，并初步学到了技术，背着钳子、锤子下乡帮助群众按装拆卸，分配了四名技术干部经常住在新农具组里。就这样的在县区亲自下手的领导方式下，解决了一联串的问题，逐渐摸索到了经验，提高了干群的思想认识，发挥了农具的效能。如在试用搂草机时，每台已达到了日搂八——十一车的纪录。影响了农民争着多要。收割机在试用中也收到了成效，提高了群众信心。如北兴区太平村刘老头起初想退出新农具组，一看好使了，马上就非参加不可。他怕弄坏了新农具，告诉小伙子们说：“好使就赶回去吧，割柴火倒是小事，留着秋天割地是大事。”看见沾上泥，他还拿柳条往下“卡擦”呢。双轮一铧犁亦已试用成功，农民使用非常顺手。此外，苞米脱粒机、手摇铡草机……等，也都经过试用收到了效果。苏联农具中的播种机，是被认为“不好使”的，但经过了大胆使用后，也在讷河县的富源村，克山的复兴村、民立村，洮安的齐文组，以及绥化的何副县长的亲自试用下，取得了应有的作用。
    此外，对新农具的效果上也要有足够的认识：（１）新式农具能使农民们从旧农具下解放出来，农民能从痛苦的劳动体会中，接受使用新式农具。如克山北兴区太平村赶搂草机的刘有林从草甸子回来说：“这家伙真好使，坐在上头可得劲啦，人没觉累，马还没出汗”。该区干部李永太也看出门道，他说：“将来新农具多了，连不能下地的妇女都能坐着赶啦！”另如在克山召开新农具组长座谈会时，北兴太平村王广财介绍搂草机效能之后，当时另一个老乡马上脱下衣服指着肩膀说：“你看我他妈搂大耙，把膀子都搂烂啦！”（２）新农具能提高生产力，多打粮、多收入。从克山北兴、北联十三个组的计划来看，使用新农具开荒三五四垧，占熟地面积百分之四二点三五，打粮一、六八六石，值三十二亿五千一百一十万元，平均每组开荒二十七垧，每组平均可收入两亿五千万元，每个劳力可多收十石九斗五升粮食。（３）新农具本身有增产性能，如双轮一铧犁地翻得匀而深，播种机在两根半垅的面积上就能增五个苗眼，发挥地力作用。在熟地耕作，播种机四个马、二个人，一天能种六垧小麦，比对犁每六垧地省人工十个，马工两个；比单镬子省十二个人工，八个马工。收割机四个马、七个人一天能割五垧小麦，用镰刀须五个人一天割一垧，五垧中省十二个人工。此外如搂草机一天搂八车到十一车，顶人工八个到十一个。从全年来看，利用新农具不但能做到不违农时，迅速完成耕作任务，而且还能余下很多劳动力参加副业生产，增加更多的收入。
    新农具是苏联使用多年已经成功了的，是苏联很早就已经推广了的，在苏联已不是新农具了，在我们这里因为才用，所以叫做新农具。
    事实证明，要想搞好这一工作，就必须要干部掌握技术，亲自动手，具体指导，做出样子，这乃是试用苏联新式农具成功与失败的关键问题。在县府及农业科及区村的领导干部，都应学会使用新农具的技术，深入生产过程中学习与摸索经验和问题，这是避免听到群众一喊“不好使”就束手无策的最好办法，如讷河县在县长县书、农业科长亲自指导下的王治俭、庄明生新农具组，就是在劳动模范王治俭、支书张树清和组织委员宋德福亲自领导，坚持试用下提高了群众信心。特别是在讷河县长县书支持下，把十二台播种机的划沟器改按小铧，解决了垅作问题。绥化何副县长的亲自动手，克山有五个县委同志的掌握技术，都获得成绩，海伦拜泉也是在县书、县长的动手下，做出了成绩。因此这些地区不但领导上摸出了办法，即小组的群众也增强了试用信心。与此相反的，有些干部既不懂技术，又不深入研究，遇到困难便束手无策，工作就搞不好。
    试用新式农具，这是一件新的事物，是要经过一个艰巨的斗争过程的，不下苦工夫，就很难吸收经验和成功的。有的县份以为轻而易举，没抓紧及时亲自领导，因而就随着群众乱跑，听到群众说：“不好使”，也就说“我看也不能好使！”另外也有些县份虽然想搞好，但由于缺乏技术，苦无具体指导办法，因而受到农民保守思想和天旱影响，也就动摇了使用新农具的信心，以至于不敢大胆试用。
    （三）根据农具的作用确定小组形式。组的大小不能以领导愿望或群众情绪来决定。组太大、人太多，思想不一致，意见不统一，不易领导，并且新旧农具交杂，旧农具影响新农具，不能充分发挥其效能。同时，组大，土地太多，就要超过新农具的效能范围，所得好处不多，就不易成功。因此在克山县北兴区杨显庭的二十八户三十多人马劳力的大组，经过了改造才适合，杨显庭也增加了领导信心。但组太小，则劳力、土地等条件就限制了新农具的效能不能充分发挥，而且负担过多，就可能赔本，更不易成功。
    一般的经验，以十二、三个劳力，十三、四匹马力，百十垧地左右的组较为合适。
    （四）必须在私有基础上确立两利制度。谨防模糊私有政策，防止平均主义现象的发生。由于使用新农具，逐渐改变着生产关系与组织形式，因此有的地方发生了准备组织合伙组，伙打伙分、强并大组的现象。对于消费与财权上，严重的模糊了私有政策，甚至出组入组都失掉了个人自由，这是违犯“在私有基础上发展生产”政策的。这样的组织形式，应彻底说服纠正，并应制定一套合理的两利制度。从克山、讷河、海伦、拜泉等县的经验来看，以下的做法比较合适：
    １、明确新农具的所有权是私有的；是全套农具做成若干股份，全组成员按股份的私有。就目前看，不可能把整套的新农具归于那一个人所有，同时也不可能把整套的分开确定那一件归那一个人所有。因为新农具本身的性能必须是联系使用的，任何一件都不能单独拿走使用。如用播种机种地，脱离开铲趟机就不能铲，少了一个双轮一铧犁，播种机就种不好。其中如开荒犁、钉齿耙之类，虽能拿走单独使用，但也不会充分的发挥其应有的作用。而且还会影响整套农具的不能使用。其次在目前农民经济负担能力，劳力数量及强度、土地、牲口等条件下，也不能把全套的新式农具的效能发挥。出组是应有自由的，但要拿走其农具，便会影响这一组的生产，而他自己也生产不好。在这样的情况下，新农具就须要在私有的基础上做成股份归全组成员共同使用。这里面应特别注意的是，不能因农具的所有权是全组成员的，而整个的限制了个人出进组的自由。对出组的应按在组内时期的长短而退还以适当的农具资金，对入组的也应该按农具使用期间的长短，投入适当的农具资金。另方面，对新农具的爱护上，应由全组人员共同做，确定盖农具库，确定专人保管，谁故意弄坏谁修理，生产弄坏由全组负责修理。
    ２、开荒地必须分归私有，按所费人马劳力均分，或按个人所需分配，然后找出人马工价，初次试种熟地也不使吃亏。如少打了粮食，由全组荒地填补。
    ３、各种消费应合理负担。如新农具浇油、修理、配零件等，不应一律均摊，应由那一台农具用于那些土地来摊款。
    ４、农具出租必须由全组同意。每件定出工价，因为头一年试种熟地少，农具效能有余，应该提倡出租，除能增加组内收入外，尚能起推广作用。
    （五）必须选择好小组，加强小组政治上的领导。
    １、选择基础较好的组，首先应着重于干部、党员、团员多的、有骨干有领导的组，并应以人强马壮，有发展可能为基本条件。一般的则以模范组较为合适，在小组领导上，要有政治工作，因为新式农具的试用还是开头，在群众中或多或少的会存在着一些疑虑。这样，在小组内就必须有骨干分子，采取坚决的态度带头与说服一般组员，把新式农具试用成功。如讷河县的庄明生组有支书张树清，组织委员宋福德在里面起了作用；克山的杨显廷组，增加了副支书吕凤彩任副组长，小组就能巩固；拜泉的仲维富组，仲维富本身是副村长、又是支委，小组就比较健全。
    ２、订好小组全年生产计划，周密的考虑到使用新式农具在全年生产中的收益，使小组内每一个成员明确的认识到使用新式农具有好处，提高其使用的信心。克山杨显廷、陈延绪、马龙庆，拜泉的仲维富、王富，讷河的王治俭、庄明生等组，在领导干部帮助订了具体的增产计划后，他们便清楚的看到了使用新农具省工多出活，能精耕细作，多开荒一定能多打粮食，每垧熟地能多打四、五斗粮，每组开荒二十垧到三十垧，平均每垧打四石粮，这样一计算，比平常组每个劳力要增加收入九石到十二石粮食。
    总起来看，目前几个使用新式农具的组，在农业生产上显著的表现出的特点有三：甲、扩大了耕地面积，提高了生产力。如克山县北兴区，全区开荒八一四垧，而仅九个新农具组就开了三百五十四垧，占全区百分之四三。如讷河王治俭组，王治俭本人就种九垧多地，超过平常劳力效能一倍多。全组每劳力今年可收五十五石粮食。乙、突出的做到了精耕细作。一般的新农具组，由于试用成功，认识到节省人工、马力，有信心在今年的铲趟工作上做到四铲四垧，如讷河王治俭组提出了五铲五趟的计划，这样就远超于一般旧犁组的三铲三趟了。丙、增加了商品粮食的耕种面积。据克山杨显庭、陈延绪、马龙庆，讷河庄明生，拜泉仲维富五个组的情况，今年共种小麦、大豆二百五十九垧八亩，占总耕地面积三百五十五垧的百分之七十三。甚至像拜泉仲维富组，商品粮占原有熟地面积的百分之一○三·六。
    从新农具的三个特点来看，新农具战胜旧农具，多打粮食，多打好粮食是完全有把握的。
