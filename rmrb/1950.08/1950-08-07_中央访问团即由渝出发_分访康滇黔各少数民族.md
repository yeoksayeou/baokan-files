　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 5th: The Central Visiting Group to the Southwest Ethnic Minorities, upon arrival in Chongqing, was warmly welcomed by all circles in the Southwest and received assistance in its work. All members of the group listened to reports from Liu Bocheng, Chairman of the Southwest Military and Administrative Committee, Deng Xiaoping, Vice Chairman, Zhou Baozhong, Vice Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial People's Government, Liao Zhigao, Chairman of the Xikang Provincial People's Government, Yang Yong, Chairman of the Guizhou Provincial People's Government, and others regarding the implementation of ethnic policies and the situation in the Southwest.

The Southwest Ethnic Affairs Committee, the Chongqing Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and the Southwest People's Broadcasting Station all held symposiums with the visiting group successively, providing suggestions for the group's visiting work. The three subgroups of the visiting group will depart for the fraternal ethnic minority areas of Kang, Yunnan, and Guizhou in the coming days to carry out visiting work.
