　　Tangshan Special District Starts Rectification Campaign
    Cadres at the Section Chief Level and Above Conduct Preliminary Inspections and Leadership Reviews of Bureaucracy in Various Tasks

    [Our Newspaper News] Tangshan Special Commissioner Ma Li reports: The Chinese Communist Party Group of the Tangshan Special District Office in Hebei Province, in order to carry out the rectification movement, convened an enlarged meeting of Party member cadres at the section chief level and above from the office and its directly affiliated units on July 8th, and conducted a preliminary inspection of the leadership work of the Special District Office. The meeting first affirmed the achievements of the political work over the past year, and then pointed out that there were many problems in the study and implementation of the Party's policies and the decisions of the Prefectural Committee in the process of completing tasks. Due to the various forms of bureaucracy among the leading cadres of the Special District Office, commandism occurred in counties, districts, and villages when implementing tasks. For example, in the three tasks of grain requisition, taxation, and public bonds, the Special District Office leadership did not have a good understanding of the situation beforehand, and lacked systematic and thorough investigation and research. When deploying tasks, they only focused on allocating numbers and setting deadlines for completion. Insufficient consideration was given to the implementation of policies, the specific conditions of different counties and districts, and the difficulties that might be encountered in the execution process, resulting in unfair allocation and disproportionate burdens. During the work process, they were not patient in studying the situation reported by lower levels and the difficulties raised, so problems could not be solved in a timely manner and shortcomings could not be quickly corrected.

    In terms of guaranteeing human rights, the leadership did not provide sufficient education to cadres beforehand, and did not actively deal with problems after they were discovered, resulting in the continuous occurrence of problems, being "neither democratic nor dictatorial." From January to May, according to incomplete statistics from twelve counties, among the 160 cadres who made mistakes, most were infringements of human rights, including 74 who beat and scolded the masses, and 47 who tied and detained people without legal procedures. Even county heads detained section members without certain procedures, and district heads detained district cadres without certain procedures, and the higher authorities did not deal with them in a timely manner. On the other hand, the handling of lawless elements and counter-revolutionaries also lacked a spirit of responsibility to the people. Among the more than 3,000 criminal cases from August last year to April this year, there were as many as 500 murderers, but not a single person has been executed. Nearly 100 prisoners have escaped in the past six months, and few have been brought to justice. As a result, bad people are arrogant and continue to do evil, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, who complain that the government is "boundlessly lenient."

    In terms of leading agricultural production, the leadership often made rigid arrangements, lacked sufficient preparation in advance, and lacked sufficient inspection during work, resulting in false reporting of figures and coercive orders in districts and villages. For example, it was not discovered until the summer grain requisition that 400,000 mu less of autumn wheat had been planted last year. This spring, the quality of cotton seeds loaned was not carefully checked, resulting in incomplete seedling emergence after planting, and many replanting. Due to insufficient preparation of seeds, 500,000 mu less peanuts were planted. At the beginning of this spring's river project, the leadership lacked sufficient understanding and neglected in-depth leadership. Later, the task became urgent, and it was forced to complete the task. In the entire 2.8 million cubic meters of earthwork project, among the 1.4 million laborers, about 200,000 labor days were wasted. In production and disaster relief, the leadership did not accurately grasp the disaster situation and lacked a comprehensive and correct analysis. In terms of helping the masses to help themselves through production, the supply of raw materials and the promotion of finished products were not timely.

    In addition, serious bureaucracy was also manifested in financial supply. The system was not strictly enforced, and supplies were not delivered on time. For example, the supply fees for May and June were not issued until the beginning of July, which affected the lives and health of cadres and increased difficulties in their work.

    Based on the above shortcomings and errors, the leading cadres of the Special District Office first made self-criticisms, analyzed the ideological roots of these phenomena, and resolved to eliminate bureaucracy in leadership, strengthen the mass viewpoint, and follow the mass line in the rectification process, in order to achieve the goals of uniting the entire Party, closely linking with the masses, implementing policies, and doing a good job.

    The meeting decided that the Party Group and cadres at the section chief level and above should continue to conduct self-criticisms, and seriously read the rectification documents, fully develop criticism and self-criticism, starting from examining the shortcomings and errors in the work of the entire office and various sections, bureaus, offices, societies, and colleges, and then proceed to examine personal ideological style, ensuring that leading cadres set an example and take the lead. The Party Group also suggested that a comprehensive inspection should be carried out on four tasks during the rectification process: guaranteeing human rights, production and disaster relief (agriculture and sideline industries), industry and commerce, and summer requisition and loan. Various departments should also conduct an inspection of their departmental work. Preparations should be made for the three autumn harvests, and a democratic life system should be established and improved within and outside the Party, and a regular inspection system should be established to carry out criticism and self-criticism in order to promote the overall work.

　　唐山专署开始整风
    科长以上干部初步检查领导检讨各项工作中的官僚主义
    【本报讯】唐山专区专员马力报道：河北省唐山专署中共党组，为开展整风运动，于七月八日召开了该署及直属各单位科长以上党员干部扩大会议，对专署的领导工作进行了初步检查。会上首先肯定了一年来政权工作中的成绩，然后指出：在完成任务的过程中，对党的政策和地委决议的研讨与执行上都有很多问题。由于专署领导干部有各种形态的官僚主义，致使县、区、村在执行任务时发生了命令主义。如征粮、税收、公债三项工作，专署领导上事先对情况不甚了解，缺乏系统的周密的调查研究，在布置工作时，只着重分配数字，限期完成任务，对于政策的贯彻、不同县区的具体情况、在执行中可能遇到的困难等方面，则考虑不够，致发生分配不公，畸轻畸重的偏向；在工作进行中，又不耐心研究下面所反映的情况和提出的困难，致使问题不能及时解决，缺点不能迅速纠正。
    在保障人权方面，领导上对干部事先教育不够，发现问题后不积极处理，以致问题不断发生，“既不民主，又不专政”。自一月至五月，据十二县不完全统计，犯错误的干部一百六十人中，大部是侵犯人权，其中有七十四人打骂群众，四十七人未按法律手续绑人押人，甚至县长不经一定手续押科员，区长不经一定手续押区干部，上级均未及时处理；另一方面，对不法分子和反革命分子的处理也缺乏对人民负责的精神。由去年八月到今年四月三千多件刑事案件中，杀人凶犯达五百名，但还没有处决过一个人；半年来犯人逃跑者近百人，很少缉捕归案，因之坏人趾高气扬，继续作恶，造成群众不满，埋怨政府“宽大无边”。
    在领导农业生产方面，领导上往往是生硬布置，事先准备不足，工作中检查不够，造成区村假报数字和强迫命令的现象。如去年种的秋麦，到夏征时才发现少种了四十万亩；今春种棉贷种未仔细检查质量，种上后出苗不全，翻种者不少；种花生因种籽准备不够，少种了五十万亩；今春的河工，开始时领导上认识不足，忽视深入领导，后来任务紧急，硬逼着完成了任务，在全部二百八十万土方工程，一百四十万个民工中，浪费人力约二十万个工。在生产救灾中，对灾情掌握不稳，缺乏全面的、正确的分析；在扶助群众生产自救方面，原料供给和成品推销都不及时。
    此外，在财政供给上也表现了严重的官僚主义，制度没有坚持执行，供给不按时。如五、六月份的供给费，到七月初才发，影响了干部的生活和健康，增加了工作中的困难。
    根据上述的缺点和错误，专署领导干部首先作了检讨，分析了产生这些现象的思想根源，决心在整风过程中扫除领导上的官僚主义，加强群众观点，走群众路线，以达到团结全党、密切联系群众、贯彻政策、搞好工作的目的。
    会上决定党组及科长以上干部继续进行检讨，并认真阅读整风文件，充分开展批评与自我批评，从检查整个工作及各科、局、室、社、院工作上的缺点和错误开始，再进到检查个人思想作风，保证领导干部以身作则，先行作起。党组并建议在整风过程中对保障人权、生产救灾（农副业）、工商业、夏征收贷等四项工作进行一次总的检查，各部门也进行一次部门工作的检查。作好对三秋工作的准备，建立与健全党内、党外的民主生活制度，并建立经常的检查制度，开展批评与自我批评，以推进整个工作。
