　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: Northeast state-owned industry has exceeded its half-year production plan. Calculated at fixed prices, as of the end of June, factories and mines had completed 44.1% of the total annual production plan, exceeding the original plan of 41.7% completion for the first half of the year by 5.7%. The total output value completed in the first half of the year exceeded the total output value of the entire previous year by 30.7%.

　　Looking at the industrial units separately: Of the 15 large industrial units under the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department, except for three units including the Machinery Administration Bureau, which did not complete the plan due to reasons such as untimely supply of raw materials, the remaining 12 units completed and exceeded the plan. Among them, the Light Industry Administration Bureau's paper making and rubber production completed the most, reaching 127.8% of the original planned total value. If calculated by 34 major products, 26 of them completed the plan, and half of them exceeded the plan by more than 20%. Among the eight products that did not complete the plan, the least was light bulbs, which completed 74.1% of the original plan.

　　There are still some serious shortcomings in the production of state-owned industry in the Northeast region in the first half of the year: (1) Low worker attendance rate: The average attendance rate in the first half of the year was 90.6%. If the total number of workers is 200,000 per day, then 3,384,000 man-days were not used for production in the first half of the year, a huge waste. (2) Many production accidents: There were more than 7,000 major and minor accidents in the first half of the year, and those caused by negligence accounted for nearly half. (3) Equipment capacity was not fully utilized. (4) Product quality cannot be consistently maintained at a good level. These shortcomings urgently need to be overcome in the second half of the year.

　　东北国营工业超额完成半年计划  生产总值超过去年全年三分之一
    【新华社沈阳电】东北国营工业上半年生产计划已超额完成。按固定价格计算，迄六月底各厂矿共完成了全年生产计划总值的百分之四十四点一；较原定上半年完成全年任务百分之四十一点七的计划，超过了百分之五点七。上半年所完成的生产总值，较去年全年的生产总值尚超过百分之三十点七。
    按产业单位分别来看：东北人民政府工业部所属十五个大的产业单位，除机械管理局等三个单位因原材料供不及时等原因未完成计划外，其余十二个单位都完成并超过了计划。其中以轻工业管理局的造纸、橡胶完成的最多，共达原计划总值的百分之一百二十七点八。若以三十四种主要产品计算，则有二十六种完成计划，其中半数且超过计划百分之二十以上。未完成计划的八种产品中，以灯泡完成原计划的百分之七十四点一为最少。
    上半年东北区国营工业生产中仍存在若干严重的缺点：（一）工人出勤率低：上半年平均出勤率为百分之九十点六，如每日工人总数为二十万人，则上半年中即有三百三十八万四千个人工没有用于生产，浪费极大。（二）生产事故多：上半年大小事故共七千余次，其中由于工作疏忽而造成者几占一半。（三）设备能力未能充分发挥和利用。（四）产品质量还不能保持经常良好。这些缺点亟须在下半年努力克服。
