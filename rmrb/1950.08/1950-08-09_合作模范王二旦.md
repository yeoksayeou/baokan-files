　　Model of Cooperation: Wang Erdan
　　Li Huanqing
　　Wang Erdan is a purchasing agent for the Yangquzhen Cooperative in Xinxian County. He is forty-eight years old this year and of the well-to-do peasant class. After the liberation of Taiyuan, the railway, which had been sabotaged by the Yan clique, was urgently in need of repair, requiring a large amount of timber. Comrade Erdan organized 260 cooperative members and ordinary people from five villages, including Xiaoshanzi, to go up the mountains to cut timber, with the able-bodied young people responsible for transporting it to the city of Taiyuan. As of this spring, the cooperative members and ordinary people had earned a total of 200,000 jin of millet (110,000 jin of which has already been received), solving the livelihood problems of farmers in several villages.
　　Last spring, due to the impact of the war, most of the land in Yangquzhen was not planted, and the masses faced difficulties obtaining clothing for the coming winter. Comrade Erdan, based on the needs of the masses, went to Taiyuan City to purchase 600 sets of used cotton-padded clothes, personally leading the county cooperative's old mule to Taiyuan for transport. In order to cherish the people's property, he only loaded forty sets on the old mule each time, carrying ten sets himself, making a total of ten round trips. In this way, he promptly supplied the needs of the cooperative members and the masses, avoiding the exploitation of speculators, saving the cooperative members' labor, and establishing the prestige of the cooperative.
　　During the spring plowing and production, in order to solve the fertilizer problems of the cooperative members and masses, he also purchased 80 jin of red alum and 525 jin of seed-mixing wine from the county cooperative. Because the masses lacked animal power, he only used livestock to transport it once, then left the livestock for the cooperative members and masses to use for production, personally carrying the remaining 280 jin of seed-mixing wine back in four trips. Comrades from the county cooperative advised him to stay overnight, but he firmly refused. He said, "Everyone needs to sow seeds tomorrow, and we can't delay."
　　The cooperative also used the 8,000 jin of grain provided by the government as agricultural tool loan to organize two iron furnaces to make agricultural tools for the cooperative members and masses. The cooperative supplied the members with 80 jin of red alum, 150 jin of seed-mixing wine, 75 iron shovels, and 140 hoes. It also provided some services to non-members. Through this business, it also organized five mutual aid teams, totaling twenty-five people, and cultivated more than 190 mu of wasteland (and is still continuing to cultivate). Under the leadership of Comrade Erdan, the cooperative itself also cultivated 42 mu of wasteland, including four mu of yams, eight mu of naked oats, eight mu of millet, and twenty-two mu of autumn naked oats, expecting to harvest more than twenty shi of grain this autumn. This not only supplied the food for all the cooperative's staff, saving expenses, but also increased the country's wealth.
　　Comrade Wang Erdan's spirit of wholeheartedly seeking the welfare of cooperative members and the masses and his hardworking and simple working style are worthy of learning by every cooperative worker.

　　合作模范王二旦
    李焕卿
    王二旦是忻县阳曲镇合作社的采购员。今年四十八岁，贪农成份。太原解放后，被阎匪破坏的铁路亟待修建，需要大批木材。二旦同志就组织起小山子等五个村的社员和群众二百六十人，上山砍伐，由青壮年负责运往太原城。截至今年春天，社员群众共收入小米二十万斤（现已领回十一万斤）解决了数村农民的生活问题。
    阳曲镇去春由于战争的影响，大部土地没能种上，秋后群众御寒的衣服就感到困难。二旦同志便根据群众需要，到太原市购买了旧棉衣六百套，亲自牵上县社的老骡子到太原去搬运。他为了爱惜人民的资财，每次只给那匹老骡子驮上四十套，自己背上十套，共计往返了十次。这样就及时地供给了社员群众的需要，避免了投机商人的剥削，并且节省了社员群众的劳力，树立了合作社的威信。
    在春耕生产中，为解决社员群众肥料的困难，他又到县合作社购妥红矾八十斤，拌种酒五百二十五斤。因群众缺乏畜力，他只用牲口驮了一次，便将牲口留给社员群众进行生产，亲自到县社将余存的二百八十斤拌种酒分四趟背回。县社同志劝他留宿，但他坚决拒绝了。他说：“大伙儿明天要下种，不能耽误。”
    合作社还用政府发给的农具贷款米八千斤组织起铁炉两座，给社员群众订制农具。该社共供给社员红矾八十斤，拌种酒一百五十斤，铁锨七十五张，钁一百四十张。对非社员也作了些服务工作。通过这一业务，并组织了五个互助组，共二十五人，开垦了荒地一百九十多亩（现仍在继续开垦中）。就这样在二旦同志的带动领导下，合作社本身也开垦了荒地四十二亩，计种植山药四亩、莜麦八亩、谷子八亩、秋莜麦二十二亩，预计今秋可收粮食二十余石。这样不但供给了全社工作人员的食粮，节省了开支，同时也替国家增加了财富。
    王二旦同志这种全心全意为社员群众谋福利的精神和艰苦朴素的工作作风，是值得每个合作社工作者向他学习的。
