　　Shanghai Work Report
    (Report to the 39th Administrative Meeting of the Government Administration Council on June 30, 1950)
    Deputy Mayor of Shanghai Municipal People's Government Pan Hannian
    (1) Shanghai's Industry and Commerce Before and After the Third People's Representative Conference
    Chairman Mao's instruction on "reasonable adjustment of industry and commerce" has more important significance for Shanghai than other places in the country. Because Shanghai's industry and commerce used to exist and develop by relying on imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, it was full of semi-colonial economic characteristics. Important industries and commerce were manipulated and monopolized by imperialism and the four major families. Therefore, a considerable number of private industries and commerce had to be full of dependence, speculation, and blindness, manifested in those shops selling dazzling high-end foreign goods, the gold and securities markets with crazy speculation, extravagant restaurants, hotels, dance halls, brothels, and those brokers, middlemen, merchants, and peddlers who were looking for opportunities. Some of them have gradually declined with the death of the old rule after liberation. From the rest, we can still see the abnormal development of Shanghai's industry and commerce, such as more commerce than industry, more speculative commerce than legitimate commerce, more processing industry than manufacturing industry, and most of the production raw materials and machines of important industries rely on foreign countries and other unreasonable phenomena. Therefore, the basic industries and commerce related to the national economy and people's livelihood do not have a solid foundation, and they only survive and develop under various unreasonable conditions, just like a bloated sick man, with only appearance. Let's give some examples: As the basis of Shanghai's industrial power production, not only is it operated by foreign companies, but also 80% of its raw materials are imported oil, not to mention it. Even 20% of the coal is mostly dependent on imported goods; 50% to 60% of the grain on which the lives of 5 million people depend relies on foreign rice and foreign flour; the cotton textile industry, which accounts for about 60% of the total equipment in the country, relies on imports for 60% of the raw cotton it needs; the wool textile industry, which accounts for 80% of the total equipment in the country, relies entirely on imported wool tops to maintain production; the flour industry, which accounts for a quarter of the total equipment in the country, relies entirely on foreign wheat for raw materials; the paper-making equipment with a monthly output of more than 6,000 tons of paper relies entirely on imported pulp; the cigarette industry with a monthly output of 120,000 cases relies on foreign countries for more than half of its cigarette paper and tobacco shreds, and others are too numerous to mention. In addition, for more than ten years, the conditions for the survival and development of these industries and commerce were mainly not based on their reasonable management and legitimate profits. Many of them colluded with or relied on bureaucratic capital, used malignant currency inflation, distributed imported foreign exchange, borrowed from the puppet government, purchased grain and coal at parity prices, hoarded various raw materials, and bought and sold gold and foreign currencies. They used these methods to make up for the losses in normal business and to pursue excessive profits. The degree of excess was such that some employees received bonuses of 180 times their monthly salary! In this way, of course, there is no need to calculate carefully (enterprise, rationalization), so the institutions are bloated, so that 150 people can manage 10,000 spindles, and some even have as many as 500 to 600 people! The total number of general managers, assistant managers, economic managers, deputy managers, and assistant managers in a factory can be as many as 20 to 30, and the salaries of these senior employees can be as high as 2,000 to 3,000 units per month. This is the basic characteristic of Shanghai's industry and commerce before the transformation. After liberation, thanks to the government's full supply of coal and grain, appropriate supply of necessary raw materials such as cotton, and handling loans, orders, processing, and purchases, it barely maintained, so that the chronic diseases of Shanghai's basic industry and commerce did not erupt rapidly. Then, after the "February 6th" bombing, the factories suddenly stopped work, credit became stagnant, labor-capital disputes arose one after another, and at the same time, financial and economic unification, timely deployment of public debt and tax tasks, and then currency contraction, suspension of loans and orders from public enterprises, and the decline of national prices, all kinds of accumulated diseases of Shanghai's industry and commerce broke out in general, and the Shanghai market immediately showed sluggish sales, depletion of funds, serious labor-capital disputes, and many closures and bankruptcies, and some capitalists also fled.
    The Third People's Representative Conference, in view of this situation, pointed out the origin and nature of the difficulties, put forward the steps and methods of "overcoming difficulties and maintaining production", and reviewed the biases of both labor and capital. After the meeting, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the decisions of the conference, the adjustment of the relationship between public and private and the relationship between labor and capital began to turn the entire deteriorating situation. As of now, it has been two months, and the necessary industrial and commercial enterprises have been able to maintain, and many fugitive capitalists have returned to Shanghai one after another. Now Shanghai's industry and commerce have entered the stage of focusing on maintaining and linking preliminary transformation and gradually achieving results, but this process will take a considerable amount of time, because there are still quite a lot of difficulties that require greater and more efforts to overcome. This is the general situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce before and after the Third Representative Conference.
    (2) The Relationship Between Public and Private Sectors in Adjustment
    When we say adjusting the relationship between public and private sectors, we should not deny the original efforts and achievements of taking both public and private interests into account. The problem is that there were biases in the work. Taking loans as an example, the People's Bank's loans in January were 98.1 billion, in February it was 157.8 billion; in March it was 244.4 billion; in April, most of the loans of private banks and firms were stagnant, and they relied on the People's Bank to handle re-mortgages to maintain. The accumulated number of short-term loans to private banks and firms in one month was 503.4 billion. Taking processing and purchasing as an example, last year, private rice mills in Shanghai undertook the processing of more than 37.78 million jin of rice, flour mills processed 39 million jin of wheat, and more than 800,000 bags of various flours. From January to March this year, nearly 500,000 bags of flour were processed. As of April 20th this year, the Huasha Cloth Company entrusted private factories to spin more than 22,700 pieces of cotton yarn and weave 796,600 pieces of various cloths, and purchased 31,639 pieces of cotton yarn and 1,052,774 pieces of cotton cloth from private factories. As of the end of March, the value of goods purchased by the Trade Trust Company was more than 360 billion, not including 12.3 billion for department store purchases, processing and orders. Without the above efforts, we cannot preserve the foundation of so many necessary and legitimate private enterprises today. The problem is that although the public sector used a lot of effort to take care of the private sector, it lacked a clear policy thinking that must take into account the overall situation, and did not distinguish between urgency, priority, necessity, and quantity, and there was somewhat of a general coping tendency. At the same time, the private enterprises that were taken care of were not given specific guidance and supervision, so that they could not exert the positive effect of maintaining and transforming.
    Since May, we have accepted the lessons of experience. According to the instructions of the Central People's Government, the relationship between the public and private sectors has undergone new development and transformation. Taking cotton spinning as an example, under the overall planning of the East China Textile Conference, before the new cotton is available in October, the Huasha Cloth Company will distribute public cotton to various private factories for spinning, at least to maintain the operating rate of 74% of private spindles for eight shifts per week. In May, Shanghai factories spun a total of 10,034 pieces of cotton yarn on behalf of the company, accounting for 50% of the total output of private factories. The planned spinning spindles in June will account for 77.23% of the private spindles. In the first week of June, the number of spindles spun on behalf of the company reached 996,808, accounting for 71.85% of the private spindles, and the output of yarn was 6,591 pieces. There is also the work of weaving on behalf of the company. In May, private factories wove a total of 240,391 pieces of cloth on behalf of the company, while only 168,140 pieces were woven on behalf of the company in March and April; there is also dyeing on behalf of the company. Only 5,090 pieces were dyed in March and April, while 60,960 pieces were dyed in May. The China Silk Company maintained 158 silk weaving factories in East China in May through the method of weaving on behalf of the company, and prepared to allocate 642 dan of silk to 41 larger units in June. The Ministry of Trade's orders and loans to the Shanghai steel rolling mill have enabled 23 of the 27 factories to resume production in May, and the remaining four factories are also seeking to resume production. Twenty-five motor factories have also resumed operation due to orders and loans. Of the 35 Shanghai paper mills that were completely closed down, 11 larger ones have been ordered to start work, so that more than 3,000 of the more than 5,000 paper workers have found work, and another four paper mills are also preparing to start work. Ninety-two of the 103 rubber products factories have received orders from the Trade Trust Company, department stores, and various field armies and are working hard, so that 80% of the equipment in the industry is used. In addition, the department store's purchases of finished products from small and medium-sized factories reached more than 180 billion in April and May, and the general transportation company mobilized private ships to transport coal and grain from March to May, reaching 50.2% of their transportation capacity. As of May 27, the balance of loans from state-owned banks was 136.2 billion, of which 117.3 billion was loaned to private enterprises, of which public utilities accounted for 72 billion. In the process of taking care of these private factories, on the one hand, the premise is that they do a good job in labor-capital relations, and at the same time, they are urged to streamline and save, and formulate a plan for break-even self-sufficiency that the labor side agrees to. In this way, it has played a considerable role in the transformation of Shanghai's industry and commerce, such as the joint operation of Shenxin factories in the cotton textile industry, the unification of Xinyudefeng and other four factories into Chengfu Company, and private Zhongfang, Dazhong, Anda, and Yong'an factories have successively worked hard to streamline and start to move towards rationalized enterprises. The development of joint operations in the silk weaving industry, and the division of labor and cooperation in the steel rolling industry and the motor industry have all produced considerable results.
    In terms of commerce, the public food company, coal briquette factory, salt store, native products company, oil company, chemical raw materials company, department store, Huasha Cloth Company, Trade Trust Company, import company and other ten organizations are adjusting their business offices and special agency stores in Shanghai, reducing retail outlets, restricting the types of retail goods, and widening the gap between wholesale and retail prices (rice and grain are raised from 2% to 5%, raw oil is raised from 2.5% to 6.5%, salt is raised from 2% to 5-6%, and sugar is raised by 12-15%). This allows retailers to get considerable profits. For example, more than 100 private grain stores that have closed down have recently reopened. Because the food company adjusted the difference between wholesale and retail prices, the difference per stone is 12,000 yuan, and there is a net profit of 3,000 to 4,000 yuan after expenses. This shows that in order to regulate food and oppose speculation and monopoly, the public sector should play a certain leading role, but at the same time take care of the private sector to have legitimate profits and serve for legitimate supply and marketing with peace of mind.
    The above adjustment of the relationship between public and private industries and commerce has made the situation of Shanghai's industries and commerce in May better than in April, and it will be even better in June. We can affirm that the adjustment of the relationship between the public and private sectors in Shanghai in the past two months has done its initial maintenance and transformation tasks for the necessary and legitimate private industries and commerce.
    (3) Labor-Capital Relations
    From the liberation of Shanghai to the end of May this year, the labor bureau has handled a total of 9,027 labor-capital disputes. In the seven months of last year, there were a total of 4,436 cases, and in the five months of this year, there were 4,591 cases. The situation of labor-capital disputes was quite serious. After the Central Committee convened the Labor Bureau Chiefs Conference and the Shanghai Third Representative Conference and other decisions were widely communicated, since May, the labor-capital relations in Shanghai have generally made considerable progress. On the one hand, the number of disputes has relatively decreased, from 1,075 in April to 750 in May.
    In addition, the organization of labor-capital consultation meetings is also continuing to develop. According to the Labor Bureau's report at the end of May, there were only 93 units connected with the bureau's labor-capital consultation meetings, of which 37 belonged to the entire industry and 56 belonged to individual factories and stores. By June 8, it had developed to 112 units, and by June 20, it had developed to 251 units. The role of labor-capital consultation has been initially manifested. Many factories have reached or approached break-even self-sufficiency through consultation, and some have gradually made profits, and have indeed achieved "overcoming difficulties and maintaining production." Workers have adopted various methods such as salary reduction, food reduction, savings, temporary evacuation, partial layoffs, and shift work to reduce the burden on the factory. At the same time, they have extended working hours, strengthened efficiency, and reduced raw materials to improve production and reduce costs. There have been many such precedents, especially in cotton textiles, where the improvement in productivity is the most concrete. Before liberation, the average productivity of private cotton spinning was 0.779 pounds per spindle for 20 hours at the highest. After liberation, this level has not been caught up. In May, this level was exceeded, reaching 0.812 pounds. In the first week of June, the average productivity reached 0.816 pounds. This is the highest record of the average production level of Shanghai's cotton spinning industry. At the same time, significant progress has been made in reducing cotton consumption, electricity consumption, and reducing the ratio of wages per piece of yarn. This is an important gain in adjusting labor-capital relations.
    However, the figures listed above also show that the work of adjusting labor-capital relations still needs to make the greatest efforts. In May, the Labor Bureau still had to handle an average of more than 20 labor-capital disputes every day. In the vast range of 200-300 industries and more than 100,000 industrial and commercial households in Shanghai, only 251 units have been formed for consultation meetings. The proportion is so small, which fully proves that this work needs to be vigorously developed. At the same time, the spirit of the Labor Bureau Chiefs Conference convened by the Central Committee and the Shanghai Third Representative Conference still needs to be continuously publicized and implemented. Among the existing labor-capital consultation meetings in various units, most of them are to resolve labor-capital disputes, and few are to consult on improving business management. Consultation on the unit of industry is more successful, consultation on the unit of factory and store is more difficult, consultation on large enterprises is easier, and small factories and stores are not easy to carry out. It should also be pointed out here that a few capitalists attempt to complete their simple and one-sided salary reduction and layoffs through consultation, without considering improving management and maintaining production. This negative approach will have no future.
    In conjunction with adjusting labor-capital relations, the relief of unemployed workers is also our urgent task. In Shanghai, in addition to the relief grain allocated by the Central Committee, we have received 4 billion yuan in donations from employed workers in Northeast China, 7.6 billion yuan in donations from employed workers in Shanghai, 1.5 billion yuan in appropriations from the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, and some scattered donations from other places. Under the overall planning of the Unemployed Workers Relief Committee, 40,000 workers in urgent need of relief have received relief grain, and the rest are being registered one after another. Recently, the Central Committee promulgated specific relief measures, which should be used to continue to promote this work.
    (4) Restoring Industry and Commerce and Consolidating Price Stability
    Chairman Mao instructed us: "Consolidating financial and economic unification, balancing income and expenditure, and stabilizing prices" is the foundation of all work in the future, and "price stability" is the specific result of financial and economic unification and balanced income and expenditure. Therefore, in the process of adjusting or transforming Shanghai's industry and commerce, "consolidating price stability" is the prerequisite for all our work. We can only adjust or transform Shanghai's industry and commerce under the condition of "consolidating price stability." Since May, thanks to the government's vigorous adjustment of the relationship between the public and private sectors from many aspects, Shanghai's industry and commerce have gradually begun to operate, and the transaction volume of various markets has also gradually increased. At the same time, the prices of several kinds of goods have fluctuated drastically, and the degree of increase has ranged from a few percent to one hundred and several tens of percent. On the other hand, the prices of several kinds of daily necessities of the people have not only not risen, but have also slightly fallen. The goods with the highest price increases are mostly imported chemical and hardware raw materials, which have no direct impact on the general people's lives. And the reason for the price increase of these goods is that most of them were originally sluggish in sales and the price fell too much, far below the cost. Once the actual sales turned strong, the price quickly returned to normal. However, there are also several kinds of goods whose prices have risen sharply, far exceeding the scope of cost and legitimate profits. There is obviously a speculative tendency in this. This situation constitutes the complexity of Shanghai's price changes in the past month. We can give several typical examples to illustrate: (omitted)
    (5) Several Tasks Related to the Regime
    It has been 13 months since the liberation of Shanghai. During this period, our work has mainly been to deal with that complex scene, and to understand the situation, learn from experience, move forward steadily, and gradually transform it. Now I would like to report on the following tasks:
    First, it is to reorganize the regime organs. We believe that the reorganization work is not only for the reduction of financial expenses, but also to pay attention to the streamlining of institutions and improve administrative efficiency. Therefore, the objects of reduction do not distinguish between old personnel and old liberated area cadres, but are based on work needs and whether they can be competent. For the surplus personnel, we are not only responsible for arranging their lives, but also for giving them learning and unified treatment in a planned way.
    Second, it is to establish district regimes. After a considerable period of preparation, we have now started to establish district governments to replace the original district takeover committees. It is expected that 20 district governments in the urban area and 10 district governments in the suburban area can be completed successively by the end of this month. The candidates for the district governments will be temporarily appointed by the municipal government. It is planned that within three months, the district governments will convene two to three district people's representative conferences to lay a considerable democratic foundation. After the fourth Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference elects the municipal government, the district representative conferences will be held to elect the district governments.
    Third, it is to strengthen the work of the consultation committee. The consultation committee is not only an advisory body, but should be the closest bridge between the people from all walks of life and the government, and at the same time, it is the city's united front organ. After the Third Representative Conference, all the consultation committee members were divided into five groups: industry and commerce, labor and capital, taxation, culture and education, and general issues. Under the leadership of the Standing Committee, in addition to discussing the issues submitted by the Standing Committee, they separately solicited the opinions of the people, and invited experts to conduct in-depth research on various practical specialized issues, and submitted suggestions to the Standing Committee for government reference. The heads of various departments of the government took turns to report on various important measures at the meeting, and answered the questions raised. In the past two months, it has played a major role in connecting the relationship between the government and the people, and will let go to make this role play as much as possible.
    Fourth, industrial and commercial registration and sound public association organizations. Shanghai is an industrial and commercial city, including tens of thousands of factories and more than 100,000 merchants. In the past, there were more than 300 trade associations, but less than 60% of the city's industrial and commercial households were members. The public association cannot include all industrial and commercial households. Now, on the one hand, it is carrying out registration, and on the other hand, it is preparing for the reorganization of trade associations. Nearly 200 public associations have been reorganized, and a preparatory committee for the Federation of Industry and Commerce has been established. Under the leadership of the preparatory committee for the Federation of Industry and Commerce, these trade associations played a very good role in promoting public bonds and participating in the democratic review of industrial and commercial taxes in the past. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen the adjustment of the relationship between public and private sectors and the adjustment between private sectors, especially how the public sector assumes the leading role for the private sector, which is worthy of the greatest efforts.
    Fifth, strengthen tax work. Shanghai's tax revenue is still in the process of exploration until today. After the Third Representative Conference, the self-reporting and actual payment of industrial and commercial taxes was changed to democratic evaluation. With the vastness and complexity of Shanghai's industrial and commercial scope, self-reporting and actual payment has already resulted in tax evasion and unfairness. It is not easy for democratic evaluation to strictly abide by the policy and reasonably complete the task. Now the three parties of the tax bureau, the consultation committee, and the preparatory committee for the Federation of Industry and Commerce are cooperating to try it out, dividing the city's industry and commerce into 34 groups and establishing a three-level evaluation committee. First, the tax bureau will conduct a general survey of taxpayers, then each group will conduct a typical survey of each industry, then each industry will self-report its turnover, and then distribute the task, and evaluate it at each level, based on the principle of not violating tax laws and tax rates and being able to eliminate tax evasion and complete the task. We hope to promote the accounting system of larger industrial and commercial enterprises from this, and gradually return to accounting and taxation. However, it is estimated that there are too many small industrial and commercial households in Shanghai, and the evaluation work is not easy to do well. The adoption of a periodic quota system for this type of industrial and commercial households not only simplifies procedures, but also benefits the state treasury revenue, and should expand the area of periodic quota in Shanghai. Other goods taxes, house donations, property taxes, etc. are also absorbing experience and considering reasonable collection methods separately.
    Sixth, public security and judicial work. After the liberation of Shanghai, the People's Government has made the greatest efforts to establish a revolutionary order and consolidate social security. In the past year, there have been no serious sabotage and counter-revolutionary actions. However, due to the complexity of the situation in Shanghai and the limitations of subjective conditions, there are still many dissatisfactions. According to statistics, from liberation to the end of April this year, 716 cases of bandits and spies were detected within the scope of public security, and more than 100 radio stations were seized. 1,027 robbery cases occurred, and 996 cases were solved; 19,413 theft cases occurred, and 10,988 cases were solved. In terms of civil and criminal litigation, the people's court accepted about 40,000 cases. After continuous intensive processing, there were still more than 6,700 backlog cases by the end of April this year. This was due to the shortage of cadres and had to be accumulated. These delayed cases inevitably cause losses to the people. After the establishment of the district government, all civil litigations that can be mediated will be handled by the district government first, and at the same time, civil divisions will be prepared, which can gradually reduce the backlog of cases. Regarding the struggle to eliminate bandits and spies and hidden counter-revolutionary elements, although considerable achievements have been made in the past, we must still be vigilant and oppose paralysis, consolidate the existing experience, and adhere to Chairman Mao's policy of combining leniency and suppression. Strengthening policy education on public security and judicial affairs and cultivating cadres is also an urgent task at present.
    Other cultural and educational, health, public utility, and construction works are omitted...
    In summary, Shanghai's situation has shifted from the struggle against blockade and bombing to a normal process of gradual restoration and gradual transformation. Our work has gradually shifted from exploration and coping to a more planned leadership and organized process. Although there are still many difficulties, and biases and shortcomings will inevitably arise, but in strengthening the development of the people's democratic unity forces, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, all cadres resolutely implement criticism and self-criticism, and nothing can stop us from moving forward! I hope that all responsible comrades will criticize and instruct my report.

　　上海市工作报告
    （一九五零年六月三十日在政务院第三十九次政务会议上的报告）
    上海市人民政府副市长  潘汉年
    （一）三届人民代表会议前后的上海工商业
    毛主席指示的“工商业合理调整”的任务，就上海来说，比国内其他地方具有更重要的意义。因为上海的工商业过去是寄生于帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本而存在发展的，因此充满了半殖民地经济的特点，重要工商业都被帝国主义及四大家族所操纵与垄断，因此相当多的私营工商业不得不充满了依赖性、投机性、盲目性，表现在那些推销金碧辉煌的高等洋货的商店，疯狂投机的金钞证券市场，穷奢极欲的餐厅酒店舞场妓馆，以及那些钻头觅缝的经纪掮客行商坐贾。其中的一部分，在解放后已随旧统治的死亡而逐渐没落了，而从其余的部分则还可以看出上海工商业的畸形发展，如商业多于工业，投机商业多于正当商业，加工工业多于制造工业，而重要工业的生产原料及机器，则大部分仰赖外国等等不合理的现象。因此各种国计民生有关的基本工商业没有确实基础，仅在各种不合理的条件下生存发展起来，正如浮肿的病夫，虚有其表，举些实例说吧：作为上海工业基础的动力生产，不仅为外商经营，其原料百分之八十用进口油料不必说，甚至百分之二十的煤也大都依靠舶来品；五百万人生命所托的粮食，依赖于洋米洋面者百分之五十至六十；占全国总设备约百分之六十的棉纺业，所需原棉有百分之六十靠进口；占全国总设备百分之八十的毛纺业，全部靠进口毛条维持生产；占全国总设备四分之一的面粉业，原料全靠洋麦；月产六千余吨纸张的造纸设备，完全依靠进口的纸浆；月产十二万箱的卷烟业，半数以上的烟纸烟丝都靠外来，其他不胜列举。加以十几年来，这些工商业生存发展的条件，主要并不是靠他们的合理经营和合法利润，有很多是勾结或依赖官僚资本，利用恶性通贷膨胀，分配进口外汇，向伪政府贷款，套购平价粮煤，囤积各种原料，买卖黄金外币，用这些作法，来弥补正常业务的亏损，来追求超额利润，其超额程度，有职员分红达月薪一百八十倍者！这样，当然不必精打细算（企业化、合理化），所以机构臃肿，以至于一五○人可以管理的一万纱锭，有的竟多至五六百人！一个厂的总、协、经、副、襄理可以多至二三十个，而这些高级职员的待遇，月薪可高至两三千个单位。这是上海工商业未经改造以前的基本特点。解放后由于政府充分供应了煤粮，适当供应了必要原料如棉花，并办了贷款、订货、加工、收购、勉强维持，使上海基本工商业的痼疾，没有迅速爆发。接着二、六轰炸，各厂突然停工，信用因而呆滞，劳资纠纷迭起，同时财经统一，公债税收任务及时展开，于是通货收缩，公营企业贷款订货等暂停，全国物价下降，上海工商业的各种积病，于是全般爆发，上海市场立刻表现出销路呆滞，资金枯竭，劳资纠纷严重，不少关厂倒店，亦有资方逃亡的。
    三届人民代表会议针对这种情况，指明困难的来历和性质，提出了“克服困难维特生产”的步骤和办法，并检讨了劳资双方的偏向。会后根据中央的指示和大会的决定，进行调整公私关系和劳资关系，使整个恶化形势开始转向，截至目前为止已经两个月的时间，必要的工商企业已能维持，且有不少逃亡资方陆续回沪。现在上海的工商业已经进入了重点维持并联系初步改造渐著成效的阶段，但这个过程需要相当长的时间，因为还有相当多的困难，需要更大更多的努力去克服。这就是三届代表会前后上海工商业的概况。
    （二）调整中的公私关系
    我们说调整公私关系，不应当否定原有公私兼顾的努力与成绩，问题是工作中发生了偏向。以贷款论，人民银行一月份的放款是九八一亿，二月份是一五七八亿；三月份是二四四四亿；在四月份，私营行庄放款大部呆滞，多靠人民银行办理转抵押维持，一个月中贷给私营行庄的短期放款累积数是五○三四亿。以加工收购论，去年上海私营米厂承接的加工米是三千七百七十八万余斤，面粉厂加工小麦是三千九百万斤，又各种粉八十余万袋，今年一至三月，加工面粉将近五十万袋。花纱布公司截至本年四月二十日止，委托私营厂代纺的棉纱是二万二千七百余件，代织的各种布是七十九万六千匹，收购了各私营厂的棉纱三万一千六百三十九件，棉布一百零五万二千七百七十四匹。贸易信托公司及收购的货值截至三月底止，是三千六百余亿，还有百货公司收购加工订货等一百二十三亿不计在内。没有以上的努力，今天不能保存这许多必要的正当私营企业基础，问题是公营虽然用了不少力量照顾私营，可是缺乏必须统筹兼顾的明确政策思想，没有分别绥急先后，必要次要，量力而行，多少有一般应付的倾向，同时对于被照顾的私营企业，又没有加以具体领导、督促，以致没有能发挥维持与改造的积极效能。
    五月份以来，我们接受了经验教训，根据中央人民政府的指示，公私关系有了新的发展与转变，以棉纺论，在华东纺织会议统筹下，准备在十月新棉上市前，花纱布公司以公有棉花分配各私营厂代纺，至少要维持私有纱锭７４％每周八班的开工率，五月份内上海各厂代纺棉纱共计一万零三十四件，占各私厂总产量５０％，六月份计划的代纺纱锭，将占私有纱锭的７７．２３％，六月第一周的情况，代纺锭已达九十九万六千八百○八枚，占私有锭７１．８５％，产纱六千五百九十一件。还有代织的工作，五月份各私营厂代织布共二十四万○三百九十一匹，三四两月份代织仅十六万八千一百四十匹；还有代染，三四两月份共仅五千○九十匹，五月份即达六万○九百六十匹。中蚕公司五月份以代织办法维持了华东丝织厂一百五十八家，六月份准备对四十一个较大单位，配丝六百四十二关担。贸易部对上海轧钢厂的订贷，在五月份已使二十七厂恢复了二十三厂，余四厂亦正谋恢复中，二十五家电机厂，亦因订贷而复业。完全停闭下来的三十五家上海造纸厂，已有规模较大的十一家得到订货而开工，使五千多造纸工人中三千多得到工作，另外还有四家纸厂亦正准备开工。一百零三家橡胶制品厂，已有九十二家得到贸易信托公司、百货公司及各野战军的订货而赶工，使该业设备动用了８０％。另外百货公司对各中小型厂成品的收购，四五两月份即达一千八百余亿，轮总公司三月到五月动员各私营轮船运煤、运粮，达到了他们的运量５０．２％，公营银行至五月二十七日止放款余额是一千三百六十二亿，其中放给私营事业的是一千一百七十三亿，其中私营的公用事业即占七百二十亿。在照顾这些私营工厂的过程中，一面是以他们搞好劳资关系为前题，同时也督促他们精简节约，订出劳方同意的保本自给计划，这样对于上海工商业的改造，已起了相当作用，如棉纺业申新各厂的合组经营，新裕德丰等四厂之统一于诚孚公司，私营中纺、大中、安达、永安各厂均相继努力精简，开始走向合理化企业化的道路，他如丝织业的发展联营，轧钢业、电机业的分工合作，均已发生相当成效。
    在商业方面，公营的粮食公司，煤球厂、盐店、土产公司、油脂公司、化工原料公司、百货公司、花纱布公司、贸易信托公司、进口公司等十个组织，在上海的营业所及特约代销店，现正进行调整，减少零销处所，限制零销物品种类，并将批发零售价格的差距放大（米粮由２％提到５％，生油由２．５％提到６．５％，盐由２％提到５—６％，糖提１２—１５％）。这样使零售商可得相当利润，例如已经倒闭的私营粮食店，最近有一百余家复业，因为食粮公司调整批发零售价格的差距后，每石相差一万二千元，除开销外有三千至四千元的净利，这就表示我们为调剂粮食，反对投机垄断，公营应该起一定的领导作用，但同时照顾到私营有正当利润可图，安心为正当供销而服务。
    以上公私工商业关系的调整情况，使五月份的上海工商业情况，较四月份均有进步，六月份当更有进步。我们可以肯定两个月来上海公私关系的调整，已经尽了对必要正当的私营工商业初步维持和改造的任务。
    （三）劳资关系问题
    上海自解放到今年的五月下旬，劳动局所处理的劳资争议，共计九○二七件，去年的七个月内，共计四四三六件，今年五个月内共计四五九一件，劳资争议情况相当严重。经过中央召开的劳动局长会议和上海市的三届代表会等决定普遍传达之后，五月份以来，上海的劳资关系一般说是有了相当进步，一方面争议案件已经相对减少，由四月份的一○七五件，减到了五月份的七五○件。
    另外劳资协商会议的组织，也正在继续发展，据劳动局五月底的报告，与该局有联系劳资协商会，仅有九三个单位，其中有三七个是属于全行业的，五十六个是属于个别厂店的，到了六月八日，发展到了一一二个单位，到六月二十日已经发展到二五一个单位。劳资协商的作用已有初步表现，有不少的工厂，已经通过协商，达到或接近了保本自给，有的也渐有盈余，确实做到了“克服困难维持生产”，工人们采用了减薪、减食、节约、临时疏散、部分解雇、轮班工作，各种不同的办法，减轻厂里的负担，同时延长工时、加强效率、节减原料等办法来提高生产、降低成本，这样的创例，已经很多，尤其在棉纺织方面，生产率普遍提高，表现得最为具体，解放以前，私营棉纺业的平均生产率，每锭二十小时最高是○·七七九磅，解放后，一直没有追上这个水平，到五月份是把这水平超过了，达到○·八一二磅，至六月份的第一周，这个平均生产率达到了○·八一六磅，这是上海棉纺业平均生产水平的最高纪录，同时对于用棉量用电量的节减，件纱工缴比率的降低等，均有显著进步，这是调整劳资关系的重要收获。
    但是上面所列举的数字，也表明调整劳资关系的工作，还须尽最大努力。在五月份，劳动局每天平均还得受理劳资争议二十几件，协商会的组织，在二百几十个行业十余万工商业户的广大范围内，才组成二百五十一个单位，所占的比例是如此之少，充分证明这项工作有待努力开展，同时中央召开的劳动局长会议和上海三届代表会议的精神，还有待继续宣传和贯彻下去。在现有各单位的劳资协商会议当中，以解决劳资纠纷者为多，协商改善经营管理者少，以同业为单位的协商较有成就，以厂店为单位的协商较困难，大的企业协商较易，小的厂店不易进行。这里还应当指出：少数资方企图通过协商完成他单纯片面的减薪裁员，不考虑改善经营维持生产，这种消极做法是不会有前途的。
    与调整劳资关系同时，失业工人救济也是我们的迫切任务，上海方面，除中央划拨的救济粮食外，已收到东北在业工人捐款四十亿，上海在业工人捐款七十六亿，上海市人民政府拨款十五亿，以及其他地方还有些零星捐款，在失业工人救济委员会统筹下，已有急待救济的四万工人领到了救济粮，其余正陆续登记中，最近中央颁布了具体救济办法，自当据以继续推进此项工作。
    （四）恢复工商业与巩固物价稳定
    毛主席指示我们：“巩固财经统一、收支平衡、物价稳定”是今后一切工作的基础，而“物价稳定”是财经统一、收支平衡的具体结果，因此在调整或改造上海工商业的过程中，“巩固物价稳定”，是我们一切工作的前提，我们只有在“巩固物价稳定”的条件下来调整或改造上海的工商业。自五月份以来，由于政府从多方面大力调整公私关系，上海的工商业逐渐开始活动，各类市场的交易量，也逐渐提高，与此同时，若干种物品的价格，连续发生剧烈波动，其上涨的程度，由百分之几到百分之一百几十，但另一方面，若干种民生日用必需品，不但未涨，而且微落，那些涨价最高的物品，大都是进口的化工五金原料，对一般人民生活没有直接影响。并且这些物品涨价的原因，一大部分是原来销路滞塞，跌价过多，远落到成本以下，一旦实销转旺，迅速恢复正常价格，但也有若干种物品，上涨剧烈，远超过成本与合法利润的范围以外，这当中显然存在着投机倾向。这种种情形，构成一月来上海物价变动的复杂性，我们可以举出几种典型的例子来说明：（略）
    （五）有关政权的几项工作
    上海解放已经十三个月了，在这一段时间当中，我们的工作，主要是在应付那个复杂的场面，并从中了解情况，吸取经验，稳步前进，逐步改造，现在提出下面几件工作来报告一下：
    第一、是整编政权机构，我们认为整编工作，不仅为了财政费用的节减，同时注意到机构精简提高行政效能，因此裁减对象，不分旧有人员与老解放区干部，以工作需要及能否胜任为准则。对编余人员，不仅负责安置生活，并予学习，有计划地统一处理。
    第二、建立区政权，经过了相当长的预备时间，现已着手建立区政府代替原有的区接管会，预计在本月底可以先后完成市区二十个区政府，郊区十个区政府，区政府的人选，暂由市政府委任。计划在三个月中，由区政府召集两次到三次的区人民代表会议，打下相当的民主基础，待第四次上海市人民代表会议选举市政府之后，再实行区代表会议选举区政府。
    第三、加强协商委员会的工作，协商委员会不仅是建议机关，应当是各界人民与政府之间最密切的联系桥梁，同时是市的统一战线机关。三届代表会议后，把全体协商委员分成工商、劳资、税务、文教、一般问题等五个小组，在常委会领导下，除商讨常委会交议事件外，分别征集人民意见，并约集专家对各项实际的专门问题作深入研究，向常委提出建议交政府参考。政府各部负责人，轮流到会报告各项重要措施，并答复所提问题。两月以来，在联系政府与人民的关系上，已经发生重大作用，并将放手使这种作用尽量发挥。
    第四、工商登记并健全公会组织。上海是一个工商业都市，包括一万几千家工厂和十万以上的商户，过去有三百多个同业公会，但会员不到全市工商户百分之六十。公会并不能包罗所有工商业户，现在正一面进行登记，一面筹备同业公会的改组，已经整顿了将近二百个公会，并成立了工商联的筹备会，在工商联筹备会领导之下，这些同业公会，过去对推销公债，参加工商业税的民主评议是起了很好的作用，以后是要加强对同业的公私关系调整与私营之间的调整，特别是公营如何负起对私营的领导作用，值得尽最大的努力。
    第五、加强税收工作。上海的税收，直至今日为止，还在摸索的过程中。三届代表会后，改工商业税的自报实缴为民主评议，以上海工商范围的广大和复杂，自报实缴固已发生偷漏和不公，民主评议要能严守政策而又合理完成任务，也非易事。现在正由税局、协商会、工商联筹备会三方面合作试办，分全市工商为三十四组，建立三级评议会，先由税局举行一度纳税户的普查，再由各组就各业作典型调查，再由各业自报营业额，再进行分配任务，逐级评议，以不违反税法税率而又能杜绝偷漏完成任务为原则。我们希望由此促进较大工商业的会计制度，逐渐回复到查账计征。但估计到上海小型工商业户数太多，评议工作也不易做好，对此类工商户采取定期定额制度，不仅手续简化，且有利国库收入，在上海应该扩大定期定额的面积。其他货物税、房捐、地产税等，也都在吸取经验，分别考虑合理征收办法中。
    第六、公安司法工作。上海解放后，建立革命秩序，巩固治安，人民政府是尽了最大努力的。一年来没有发生严重的破坏与反革命行动。但由于上海情况的复杂，主观条件的限制，不满人意之处仍多。计自解放至本年四月底止，在公安范围内，破获匪特案件七一六起，缴获电台一○○余架。发生劫案一○二七件，破获者九九六件；发生盗案一九四一三件，破获一○九八八件。在民刑诉讼方面，人民法院受理案件约四万件，经过连续突击处理，至本年四月底，仍有积案六千七百余件，这是由于干部不足而不得不积压下来。这些拖延的案件，难免不使人民遭受损失。区政府成立之后，凡属可以调解的民事诉讼，先由区政府调处，一面并筹备民事分庭，当可逐渐减少积案。关于肃清匪特与隐蔽的反革命分子的斗争，过去虽已取得相当成绩，今后仍须提高警惕，反对麻痹，巩固已有经验，坚持毛主席的宽大与镇压相结合的政策。加强公安司法的政策教育，培养干部，也是当前迫切工作。
    其他文教、卫生、公用、工务…………等工作从略。
    综上所述情形，上海的局面，已由反封锁反轰炸的斗争，转入了逐步恢复、逐步改造的正常过程。我们的工作，已由摸索、应付，逐渐转入较有计划的领导与组织化的过程。虽然还有不少困难，不可免地还会产生偏向与缺点，但在加强人民民主团结力量的发展，在毛主席和中央人民政府的正确领导下面，一切干部坚决执行批评与自我批评，没有什么能够阻止我们前进！希望各位负责同志对我的报告，加以批评和指示。
