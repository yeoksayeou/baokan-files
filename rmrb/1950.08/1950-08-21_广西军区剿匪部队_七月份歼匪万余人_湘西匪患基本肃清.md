Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, August 18th: The People's Liberation Army Guangxi Military Region's 剿匪 forces, in their bandit suppression operations, correctly grasped the tactic of striving to annihilate entire gangs to prevent remnant bandits from escaping, achieving significant results. In total, over 10,170 bandits were annihilated in July. In many battles, the bandit gangs were completely wiped out, with no one escaping. These include the encirclement and annihilation of a gang of bandits in Bobai County on July 6th, the encirclement and annihilation of Wu Sangui's gang in the mountainous area of Baishou County on July 8th, the attack on the bandit "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army Fifth Army Headquarters" within Jingxi County on July 17th, the encirclement and annihilation of Gan Mengxuan's bandit secret service battalion in Xiuren County on July 19th, and the encirclement and annihilation of the bandit "Guangdong-Guangxi Border Anti-Communist National Salvation Self-Defense Army Twelfth Column Sixth Detachment Second Regiment" in the area north of Qinzhou, Guangdong, on July 29th. In each of these battles, the bandits, from the bandit leaders down, were completely annihilated by our 剿匪 forces, with no one escaping. After repeated and painful blows by the People's Liberation Army, the remaining bandits within Guangxi have had their arrogance greatly diminished.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 18th: Western Hunan, where banditry has persisted for over a century, has basically eliminated the bandit scourge after a half-year of active suppression by the People's Liberation Army Fourth Field Army, which annihilated over 40,000 bandits. Except for a small number of bandits still fleeing in the deep mountains and dense forests of the border counties, the banditry has been basically eliminated. After the basic elimination of bandits in the central areas of twenty-two counties, including Dayong, Yuanling, Zhijiang, and Huitong, the peasants are actively carrying out summer harvesting and summer planting with unparalleled joy, and have further launched movements against local tyrants and for rent reduction.

    【新华社南宁十八日电】人民解放军广西军区剿匪部队在剿匪作战中正确地掌握了力求整股消灭不使残匪脱逃的战术，获得显著战果，总计七月份内歼匪达一万零一百七十人。其中有多次战斗是将匪众悉数歼灭，无一人漏网。七月六日围歼博白县境股匪、八日围歼百寿县境山区吴三贵部股匪、十七日进击靖西境内匪“反共救国军第五军军部”、十九日在修仁县围歼干蒙轩匪部特务营、二十九日在广东钦州以北地区围歼匪“粤桂边反共救国自卫军第十二纵队六支队二总队”等各次战斗中，匪众自匪首以下均被我剿匪部队全部歼灭，无一脱逃。广西境内残余土匪经解放军迭次痛歼后，气焰大杀。
    【新华社汉口十八日电】百余年匪患未息的湘西，经过人民解放军第四野战军半年来的积极清剿，消灭了土匪四万余人之后，现除边境县份深山密林中尚有少数小部土匪流窜外，匪患已基本肃清。大庸、沅陵、芷江、会同等二十二县中心地区的农民在土匪基本肃清后，都以无比的欢乐心情积极进行夏收、夏耘工作，并已进一步展开反恶霸和减租运动。
