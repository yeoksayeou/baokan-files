Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, August 21st: Since the liberation of Xinjiang Province, the Provincial People's Government and local governments at all levels have actively assisted various ethnic groups in developing news and publishing, and preliminary achievements have been made. In terms of news work, the provincial newspapers that have been newly established or relaunched include the "Xinjiang Daily" in Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian, and the "Forward Newspaper" (Uyghur) which is the organ of the Xinjiang People's Democratic League. Local newspapers at all levels include the "New Road Newspaper" (Uyghur, Kazakh, and Xibe versions) published in Yining, the "Free Altay Newspaper" (Kazakh) in Altay, the "Democracy Newspaper" (Uyghur) in Tacheng, the "Tianshan Daily" (Uyghur) in Kashgar, and local Uyghur newspapers published in Aksu, Hotan, and Shache. The aforementioned newspapers include dailies, every-other-day publications, and three-day publications, with circulations ranging from over 2,000 to over 10,000 copies.

In terms of broadcasting, the Dihua People's Broadcasting Station has increased its daily broadcast time from three hours to five hours and thirty minutes, with Uyghur and Chinese each accounting for approximately half. The station also established relay stations in Hami, Yanqi, Aksu, and other places in June.

In terms of publishing, the Uyghur books that have been published include "Documents of the People's Political Consultative Conference," as well as Chairman Mao's works such as "On New Democracy," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art"; Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's "On Internationalism and Nationalism"; and Zhang Ruxin's "Mao Zedong's Outlook on Life," etc. The total number of copies issued has reached more than 70,000. The Kazakh version of "On New Democracy" is currently being printed. The translation office under the leadership of the Xinjiang Provincial Committee of Culture and Education plans to translate more than 20 kinds of Uyghur books, totaling more than 500,000 words, and eight kinds of Kazakh books, totaling about 120,000 words, by the end of September. Among them are Uyghur and Kazakh Chinese and primary school textbooks, which will be printed in large quantities to meet the needs of the opening of various schools next semester. The Xinjiang Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has also published the "Sino-Soviet Friendship" monthly in Uyghur and Chinese, with two issues published in each language. The Dihua branch of Xinhua Bookstore and the Hami and Kashgar branches have also organized mobile teams, departing from Dihua to carry out publicity and sales in Suilai, Wusu, Yining, Fuyuan, Qitai and other places, which have been welcomed by the people of various places. People from all ethnic groups, intellectuals, young workers, staff, and government workers are competing to purchase and read Chairman Mao's works. For example, after the "Policy on the United Front of Culture and Education" was printed (5,000 copies), it was immediately snapped up. The number of various books and newspapers transported from Beijing and the mainland to Xinjiang is also increasing day by day. The urgent problems that need to be improved and solved in the current translation and publishing work are mainly the careful review and correction of translated books, so that the translated text can be completely accurate. Secondly, it is necessary to reduce printing costs and appropriately reduce book prices.

　　新疆各民族新闻出版事业迅速发展
    【新华社迪化二十一日电】新疆省解放以来，省人民政府及各级地方政府积极帮助各族人民发展新闻出版事业，已获得初步成绩。在新闻工作方面，先后创刊和复刊的省级报纸，有汉文版、维吾尔文版、哈萨克文版、蒙文版等四种文字的《新疆日报》和新疆人民民主同盟的机关报《前进报》（维吾尔文）；各级地方报纸有伊宁出版的《新路报》（维吾尔文版，哈萨克文版，锡伯文版共三种）、阿山的《自由阿山报》（哈文）、塔城的《民主报》（维文）、喀什的《天南日报》（维文），阿克苏、和阗、莎车也各出版维吾尔文地方报。上述各报包括日刊、隔日刊、三日刊三种，发行数量自二千余份至一万余份。
    在广播事业方面，迪化市人民广播电台每日播音已由三小时增至五小时三十分，维吾尔语、汉语约各占一半。该台并于六月间先后在哈密、焉耆、阿克苏等地设立转音站。
    在出版事业方面，已经出版的维吾尔文书籍除《人民政协文献》外，有毛主席的著作《新民主主义论》、《论人民民主专政》、《中国革命与中国共产党》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等；刘少奇副主席的《论国际主义与民族主义》；张如心的《毛泽东之人生观》等书。发行数共达七万册以上。哈萨克文的《新民主主义论》正在印刷中。新疆省文教委员会领导下的翻译处，计划至九月底译出维吾尔文书籍二十余种，约五十余万字；哈萨克文书籍八种，约十二万余字。其中有维、哈文的中、小学课本，将大量印刷，以满足各学校下学期开学的需要。中苏友好协会新疆分会并以维吾尔文、汉文出版《中苏友好》月刊，已各出版两期。新华书店迪化分店和哈密、喀什支店，也分别组织流动小组，由迪化出发，至绥来、乌苏、伊宁、孚远、奇台等地进行宣传推销，受到各地人民的欢迎。各民族文化界、知识青年、职工、政府工作人员对毛主席著作都争相购阅。如《文教统一战线方针》印出后（五千册），立即被抢购一空。由北京和内地运到新疆的各种书报、刊物的数量也日益增多。目前在翻译出版工作中急需改进和解决的问题，主要是翻译书籍的慎重审核和校正，使翻译的文字能够完全正确。其次是减少印刷成本，适当减低书价。
