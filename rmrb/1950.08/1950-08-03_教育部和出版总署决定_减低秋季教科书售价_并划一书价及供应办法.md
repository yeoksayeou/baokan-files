　　Ministry of Education and General Administration of Publications Decide
    Reduce Textbook Prices for Autumn
    And Standardize Book Prices and Supply Methods
    [Xinhua News Agency] The Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government issued on July 5th a "Decision on Reducing and Standardizing Textbook Prices and Supply Methods for the Autumn of 1950" to the Education Departments of major administrative regions, the Cultural and Educational Bureaus of provinces and cities, the News and Publication Bureaus of major administrative regions, the News and Publication Offices of provinces and cities, the General Administration Office of Xinhua Bookstore and its branch stores. The full text is as follows:
    Having investigated that textbook prices and sales methods were determined independently in various regions during the spring semester of this year. Textbook prices were expensive in some areas, and supply could not be timely, causing students to be unable to afford them, and suffering from not having books to read. In addition to striving for standardization in the textbooks used in primary and secondary schools this autumn, which has been notified separately, the textbook prices and supply methods are stipulated as follows. It is hoped that the education and publishing organs in various regions will follow this decision after receiving it, and report the implementation status to the Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Publications of the Central People's Government respectively at any time.
    (1) Since the national prices have been basically stabilized, the basic pricing system should be abolished for autumn textbooks except in the Northeast, and RMB pricing should be adopted. The book prices sold to schools and students in various regions should be calculated in accordance with the currency price marked on the book, and no surcharges or price increases should be made for any reason.
    (2) The prices in North China, East China (including Shandong), and Central and South China (including South China) should be completely unified. It is stipulated that primary school textbooks should use 36-open format, with each page (two sides) of domestic newsprint priced at RMB 24 yuan (imported newsprint priced at RMB 31.2 yuan), and the two pages of the cover counted as three pages. Middle school textbooks should use 32-open format, with each page of domestic newsprint priced at RMB 28 yuan (imported newsprint priced at RMB 36.6 yuan), and the two pages of the cover counted as five pages.
    (3) Northwest, Southwest, and Xinjiang, due to higher manufacturing costs and freight, may set separate price standards according to local conditions, but shall not be higher than 50% of the above standards. This price standard should be stipulated by the education and publishing administrative organs and the general branch of Xinhua Bookstore in Northwest, Southwest, and Xinjiang, and should be standardized within each region after stipulation, and should be immediately reported to the Central Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Publications. If these regions do have difficulties and cannot price according to the above standards, it is hoped that the local competent authorities will assist and the local people's governments will provide appropriate subsidies.
    (4) After the currency pricing of textbooks in various regions is determined, the price list should be published in the local daily newspaper and distributed as a book list, and no price increases should be made midway.
    (5) The postage and packaging costs of textbooks should be uniformly withdrawn by the general branch of Xinhua Bookstore or the joint publishing house at 5% of the book proceeds from the sale of textbooks in various regions, and a separate accounting item should be established. All textbook postage within its region shall be borne by the general branch of Xinhua Bookstore or the joint publishing house. If the general branch stores and joint publishing houses in various regions have losses in postage during settlement, they may request subsidies from the General Administration of Publications.
    (6) The wholesale price of primary and secondary school textbooks from Xinhua Bookstore or the joint publishing house to various bookstores and vendors shall be fixed at 80% of the actual price. In addition, preferential discounts for schools, organizations, or individuals purchasing books should be abolished.
    (7) The prices of textbooks published by private bookstores can be determined by the publishers themselves, but it is hoped that they will be uniformly changed to currency pricing this autumn.
    (8) In order to reduce book prices and protect the domestic paper industry, textbooks should use domestic paper as much as possible, especially in paper-producing areas, local paper must be used for manufacturing.
    (9) Local education administrative organs should assist textbook supply agencies in conducting detailed surveys of the types and required quantities of books used in primary and secondary schools this semester, so that textbook supply agencies can grasp the quantity of inventory and sales. The inventory loss in various regions this semester should not exceed 5% of the total sales.

　　教育部和出版总署决定
    减低秋季教科书售价
    并划一书价及供应办法
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府教育部、出版总署于七月五日对各大行政区教育部、各省、市文教厅、教育局、各大行政区新闻出版局、各省、市新闻出版处、新华书店总管理处和各总分店发出“关于一九五○年秋季教科书减低并划一售价及供应办法的决定”。全文如下：
    查本年春季教科书，各地自行规定售价及供销办法。若干地区书价昂贵，供应不能及时，学生无力负担、感无书读之苦。本年秋季除中小学校采用教科书本，应力求划一，已另发通知外，关于教科书售价及供应办法，规定如下。希各地教育及出版机关，接到本决定后，遵照办理，并将办理情况随时向中央人民政府教育部及出版总署分别报告。
    （一）由于全国物价基本上业已稳定，故秋季教科书除东北外应即废除基本定价，改用人民币定价，各地售与学校及学生的书价，一律按照书面标明的货币价格计算，不得根据任何理由，加成或加价出售。
    （二）华北、华东（包括山东）、中南（包括华南）三地区，售价应完全划一，规定小学课本用三十六开本，每页（二面）国产报纸为人民币二十四元（进口报纸为人民币三十一元二角），封面二页作为三页计。中学课本用三十二开本，每页国产报纸为人民币二十八元（进口报纸为人民币三十六元六角），封面二页作为五页计。
    （三）西北、西南及新疆，由于造货成本及运费较高，得按当地情形另定售价标准，但不得高于上列标准百分之五十。此项售价标准，应由西北、西南及新疆教育及出版行政机关会同新华书店总分店予以规定，规定后在各地区内应求划一，并应立即申报中央教育部及出版总署。如各该地区确有困难，不能按照以上标准定价，则望由当地主管机关协助，由各地方人民政府予以适当之补贴。
    （四）各地区课本货币定价确定后，应将价目在当地日报公布，并印成书目分发，中途不得加价。
    （五）教科书邮运及包扎费，应由新华书店总分店或联合出版社就远近各地售出课本所得书款内，一律提出百分之五，另立会计项目。在其地区内教科书邮运费一律由新华书店总分店或联合出版社负担。各地总分店及联合出版社于结算时，邮运费如有亏耗，得呈请出版总署予以补贴。
    （六）新华书店或联合出版社对各书店及摊贩批售中小学课本，一律定为八折实收。此外学校、机关或个人购书，优待折扣应一律废除。
    （七）私营书店出版之课本，其售价可由出版者自行规定，但希望于本年秋季一律改为货币定价。
    （八）为抑低书价并保护本国造纸工业，教科用书应尽可能采用国产纸，尤其在产纸地区，必须用本地纸造货。
    （九）各地教育行政机关应协助教科书供应机构，详细调查本季中小学用书种类及需要确数，以便教科书供应机构得以掌握存销数量。本季各地存书损失，应不超过总销数百分之五。
