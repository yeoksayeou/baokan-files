　　Recovery of Cotton Production in the Nantong Cotton-Producing Area

    The Nantong area of northern Jiangsu province has over two million mu of cotton fields, making it a major cotton-producing region in northern Jiangsu. In 1937, the area produced 73 million jin of ginned cotton. However, during the years of war, cotton farmers suffered the疯狂疯狂掠夺 (frenzied plunder) of imperialists and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The productivity of cotton farmers was greatly reduced, the area planted with cotton shrank, the cotton seeds became mixed and degraded, and with the water conservancy works in disrepair for many years, cotton production declined rapidly. In recent years, the average yield has only been about 50 to 70 percent of pre-war levels. Since the liberation of the entire area last year, the local people's government and the Communist Party committee have vigorously led the work of restoring cotton fields. The area planted with cotton increased to more than 1.69 million mu, but due to severe flooding, only 28.2 million jin of cotton were harvested last year.

    In order to prevent and overcome future floods, the area first carried out large-scale water control work last winter and this spring, even though it was in the midst of a severe famine. The people's government allocated more than 23.3 million jin of grain, mobilized 600,000 laborers, excavated about 8,156,000 cubic meters of river, and repaired 3,864,000 cubic meters of Jianghai seawall, directly benefiting an area of 4,188,800 mu. After Rudong County completed the water conservancy project last winter, it is estimated that the cotton-growing area alone can increase cotton production by 2 million jin. The Kengqu area excavated the Juekan River, which is 30 li long, solving the drainage problem for cotton fields in the entire area. At the same time, the government, on the one hand, called on cotton farmers to retain, preserve, and purchase and regulate cotton seeds in large quantities; on the other hand, it loaned more than 7.586 million jin of cotton seeds, solving the seed shortage problem for 648,504 mu of cotton fields. Among them, the focus was on lending 1,063,980 jin of pure "Dai Zi Cotton" No. 15, 500,000 jin of "De Zi Cotton" seeds, and 754,902 jin of Shandong cotton seeds.

    The cotton-producing area is mostly a severely disaster-stricken area, lacking grain for many years. Also, because cotton farmers do not have sufficient understanding of cotton planting and generally have many concerns, various localities combined the production and disaster relief movement to carry out publicity and mobilization for cotton planting, which rapidly improved the cotton farmers' production enthusiasm and actively expanded the cotton planting area. For example, cotton farmers in Sanyu District of Nantong County have been hiring cattle to cultivate land and reclaim wasteland. Since spring and summer, the entire district has reclaimed a total of 2,891 mu of raw and ripe wasteland, most of which has been planted with cotton. The cotton seedlings in the ripe wasteland reclaimed in several western townships are growing vigorously, and cotton farmers are actively weeding and hoeing. This year, Juedong District of Rudong County planted more than 146,000 mu of cotton, an increase of 8,986 mu compared to last year. It is estimated that the entire special district (seven counties and one city) planted a total of 2,068,294 mu of cotton, an increase of more than 378,000 mu compared to last year, and it is estimated that it can produce more than 54,182,000 jin of ginned cotton.

    In order to promote the superior varieties, the area also selected 15 townships in Juedong, Sanyu and other places as pure seed management areas for Dai Zi Cotton No. 15, and established a pure seed management committee. Each township has a cotton reclamation committee, and cotton farmers in each village have organized pure seed inspection teams. This year, the two districts planted a total of 165,000 mu of Dai Zi Cotton, which can produce 5,781,405 jin of ginned cotton. The pure seeds can be propagated six times next year, that is, 900,000 mu, which can enable more than 700,000 mu of American cotton fields in the entire special district to be replanted with Dai Zi Cotton, and can supply cotton seeds to other regions for 200,000 mu. Secondly, the Cotton Reclamation Sub-bureau has established a directly affiliated cotton crop experimental farm in Gong'an Township, Sanyu District. The experimental work is carried out in cooperation with local cotton farmers' work groups. The experimental results are introduced to everyone by the cotton farmers themselves. In addition, agricultural affairs consultation offices are set up to hold forums with farmers to exchange cotton planting experience and improve agricultural techniques. Rudong, Qidong, and Haimen counties are also preparing to establish cotton crop demonstration farms this year to carry out this work. The Cotton Reclamation Bureau is designing to set up a processing factory in Sanyu Town to ensure the purity of cotton seeds.

    By the end of July, the cotton seedlings in the good areas of the district had grown to more than two feet high, and the average was about one and a half feet. The second weeding had been completed in general, and the third weeding had been completed in some good areas, and the fourth weeding had begun. Cotton farmers in Qidong District of Qidong County have also organized cotton weeding inspection teams to inspect and supervise each other to complete this year's cotton production increase task.

　　恢复生产中的南通产棉区
    苏北南通区有棉田二百多万亩，为苏北的主要产棉区。一九三七年该区出产皮棉七千三百万斤。但在历年战争中，棉农遭受了帝国主义和国民党反动派的疯狂掠夺。棉农生产力大减，植棉面积缩小，棉种混杂退化，加以水利多年失修，棉花产量迅速下降，近几年来平均产量只相当于战前百分之五十到七十左右。自去年全区解放后，当地人民政府与中共党委即大力领导进行棉田恢复工作，全区植棉面积即增加到一百六十九万多亩，但因遭受严重水灾，去年仅收棉花二千八百二十多万斤。
    为免除与克服今后水患，在去冬和今春，该区虽处于严重灾荒的情况下，即首先进行了大规模的治水工作，人民政府拨粮二千三百三十多万斤，发动民工六十万，约开河八百十五万六千余公方，修江海堤三百八十六万四千余公方，直接受益面积四百十八万八千余亩。如东县完成去冬水利工程后，单植棉地区估计可增产棉花二百万斤。垦区掘长区新开三十华里长的掘坎河，使全区棉田的排水问题得到解决。同时，政府一面号召棉农留种、保种、大量收购调剂棉种；一面贷放棉种七百五十八万六千多斤，解决了六十四万八千五百零四亩棉田的缺种困难。其中并重点贷放优良品种“岱字棉”十五号纯种一百零六万三千九百八十斤，“德字棉”种五十万斤，山东棉种七十五万四千九百零二斤。
    该地产棉区绝大部分为重灾区，历年缺少粮食，又因棉农对植棉的认识不足，一般顾虑很多，故各地结合生产救灾运动，进行了植棉的宣传动员，使棉农生产情绪迅速提高，积极扩大植棉面积。如南通县三余区棉农纷纷雇牛耕地开荒，全区春夏季以来共开垦生熟荒田二千八百九十一亩，大部都种了棉花，西部几个乡开垦出的熟荒田，棉苗旺盛，棉农都正在积极薅草锄草。如东县掘东区今年植棉十四万六千多亩，比去年增加棉田八千九百八十六亩。总计全专区（七县一市）共植棉二百零六万八千二百九十四亩，较去年增加棉田三十七万八千多亩，估计可产皮棉五千四百十八万二千多斤。
    为使优良品种的推广，该区又选掘东、三余等地十五个乡，为岱字棉十五号纯种管理区，并建立了纯种管理委员会，乡设棉垦委员会，各村棉农组织了纯种检查小组。今年该两区共种岱字棉十六万五千亩，可产皮棉五百七十八万一千四百零五斤，纯种明年可繁殖六倍，即九十万亩，可使全专区七十万余亩美棉田换种岱字棉，并可供给其他地区棉种二十万亩。其次，棉垦分局在三余区贡安乡设立了直属棉作试验场，试验工作是与当地棉农伴工组合作，试验结果由棉农自己向大家介绍，另外并设立农事问事处，约农户开座谈会等，交流植棉经验，改良农作技术。如东、启东、海门三县也准备今年建立棉作示范场，进行此项工作。棉垦局正设计在三余镇设立加工工厂，以保证棉籽纯良。
    至七月下旬，该区棉苗好的地区已长二尺多高，一般的也在一尺半左右，二遍草普遍锄完，部分好的地三遍已锄完，开始锄四遍。启东县启东区棉农，还组织了锄棉检查小组，互相检查督促，完成今年棉花增产任务。
