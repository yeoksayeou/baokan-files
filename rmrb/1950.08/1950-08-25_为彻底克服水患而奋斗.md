　　Striving to Completely Overcome Floods
    Sun Xiaocun

    I. The 1949 Flood

    The flood of 1949 was the largest since 1931. The main disaster area in 1931 was the Jianghuai River basin, while in 1949 the scope was wider. The total affected farmland exceeded 100 million mu, with a grain loss of over 10 billion jin, and a disaster-stricken population of 40 million. Regionally, northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, eastern Hebei, and Huxi in the plains suffered the most, followed by western Liaoning, Hubei, Hunan, southern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu. By river basin, the Huai River basin, the Chaobai River basin, and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River were the most severely affected, followed by the Liao River basin and the Pearl River basin.

    What were the main causes of the flood? We can say with certainty that it was the result of the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Looking back at Chinese history, the Chinese people's struggle against water is a major event. In the past, whether a dynasty was stable and whether the ruling foundation was solid depended on whether attention was paid to water conservancy. The Kuomintang reactionaries were in power for more than 20 years, but they perfunctorily dealt with water conservancy work, which concerned the livelihood of the people. In the later period, they even did many things that were contrary to water conservancy work, causing the original water conservancy projects in various places to be in disrepair for a long time. Therefore, the cycle of floods gradually shortened, the flood area gradually expanded, and the degree of disaster gradually deepened. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek breached the Yellow River dyke at Huayuankou, and the Yellow River entered the Huai River through the Sha River, creating a vast Yellow River flood area, which brought long-term disasters to the people in this area. The crimes committed by the Chiang Kai-shek gang in water conservancy work reached their peak.

    In last year's flood-stricken areas, the old liberated areas, thanks to the strong leadership of the people's government, combined administration, technology, and the masses, and waged a resolute struggle against the flood, thus achieving victory and reducing the disaster area. For example, the flow of the Yellow River at Shanzhou exceeded 10,000 cubic meters per second, but there was no breach, protecting the lives and property of millions of people. In the newly liberated areas, thanks to the vigorous rescue efforts of the people's government, not only was the flood stopped from developing, but many flooded farmlands were also rescued. Taking East China as an example, in 1949, 42% of the total number of flooded farmlands, which was over 40 million mu, were rescued. In the fight against the flood, cadres and the masses created many touching heroic deeds, laying a solid foundation for the Chinese people's future water control struggle.

    II. The 1950 Water Conservancy Plan and Achievements in the First Half of the Year

    In October last year, the Central People's Government was established. In view of the severity of the floods and the urgent desire to relieve the people from their deep suffering, it convened a joint conference of water conservancy in various liberated areas in November, and decided that the basic policy of water conservancy construction was to prevent floods, develop water conservancy, and achieve the purpose of developing production. The focus of the work was: in areas threatened by floods, emphasis was placed on flood control and drainage; in arid areas, emphasis was placed on opening canals for irrigation. The total water conservancy expenditure inside and outside the customs reached more than 1 billion jin of millet. This number is unprecedented in Chinese history. At that time, the People's Government had just been established, and under the three major financial tasks of eliminating the remnants of the enemy, ensuring the supply of millions of military and government personnel, and transferring grain for disaster relief and famine preparedness, so much money was allocated for water conservancy, which shows the determination of the People's Government to eliminate floods.

    In the allocation of water conservancy funds in 1950, flood control and drainage accounted for about 73% of the total expenditure nationwide, irrigation accounted for about 19%, surveying and research accounted for about 4.7%, and the rest accounted for about 3.3%. From the perspective of each region, the distribution is shown in the following table:

    	Region	East China	Central South	North China	Northwest	Northeast
    Item (Percentage)
    Flood Control	94.6	90.2	61.7	6.1	31.8
    Irrigation	1.3	4.3	28.2	79.4	37.0
    Other	4.1	5.5	10.1	14.5	31.2

    From this, it can be clearly seen that flood control work was the most important in the 1950 water conservancy plan.

    Nationwide, the planned earthwork volume for flood control, irrigation, drainage, and fundamental cure projects such as waterway regulation was about 360 million cubic meters, and the stonework volume was about 1.15 million cubic meters. In the first half of the year, 360 million cubic meters of earthwork (including 35.4 million cubic meters of local projects in East China) and 1.6 million cubic meters of stonework have been completed. Among them, the completed earthwork volume of flood control projects was 310.82 million cubic meters, which is more than 2.6 times the earthwork volume of 116 million cubic meters completed nationwide from the winter of 1931 to 1932 after the great flood of 1931. This achievement is unprecedented.

    In terms of mobilizing laborers, according to incomplete statistics, the number reached 4.69 million.

    In combination with disaster relief, East China statistics show that 2.9 million laborers were mobilized, and the number of people combined with disaster relief reached more than 5 million. Nationwide, about 10 million people survived the famine due to dike construction.

    These achievements are mainly due to the emphasis on leadership at all levels and the urgent demand of the masses for water conservancy construction, which has led to an unprecedented great water control movement.

    III. The Test of Floods

    Spring construction is the material basis for flood control, flood control is the test of spring construction, and the organizational force of flood control is the key to mastering this material basis and giving full play to its role. Therefore, before the flood season arrived, the Central Ministry of Water Conservancy convened a national flood control conference to determine the flood control policy and tasks for this year, and to solve the problems of organizational leadership, flood control funding, and flood reporting methods. At the flood control conference, according to the different conditions of each river and the achievements of spring construction, specific tasks of "protecting the line, protecting the area, protecting the water level, and protecting the flow" were stipulated for each river, guaranteeing that 70 million mu of the land affected last year would be spared from floods under the same flood conditions as last year.

    After the closing of the flood control conference, the Central Flood Control Headquarters and regional flood control headquarters were established successively, and the flood season began.

    In the past two months, the Yongding River has experienced six floods, the largest of which was in early August. On the 4th, the water level at Lugouqiao rose to 64.40 meters above the Dagu zero point, exceeding the 1949 water level by 1.20 meters. The flow rate was estimated to be 2,700 cubic meters per second, which is several times the flow rate in 1949. After the diversion into the Xiaoqing River, the water level fell successively. Other rivers in North China have also risen universally due to continuous heavy rains in various places since August. The maximum flow rate has exceeded last year's by one to four times. In this long and arduous process, thanks to the desperate struggle of the Party, government, army and people, great achievements have been made. The main and branch lines of the Nanyun River and the main stream of the Ziya River have not breached. The Fuyang River has not overflowed. Many dangerous works on the Yongding River have turned into safety. The Luan River has not had any accidents. The old and new channels of the Chaobai River have not breached. However, due to this year's excessive mountain floods and scouring water, and the failure to repair the tributaries of various rivers in time, the Daqing River, Jiyun River, and Hutuo River have overflowed, flooding 4.5 million mu of land.

    The water situation in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River is stable. Only in Suiyuan and Ningxia, due to the thawing of the Yellow River in March and the obstruction of ice, 1 million mu of land was affected.

    The Xinhe River in northern Jiangsu has passed two flood tests without any problems.

    Rivers such as the Yangtze River and the Pearl River have had minor breaches, but they have basically passed safely.

    According to recent incomplete statistics, except for the Huai River basin in northern Anhui, the affected area nationwide is about 15.76 million mu, most of which was once flooded, but has now been rescued. In terms of the rainfall and flood volume in various places this year, the water conservancy work in the past six months has been successful. We should recognize that if there were no these efforts, if so much money were not spent, the flood situation in various places this year would not be much smaller than last year.

    IV. Trouble in the Huai River Basin

    In all the water conservancy work this year, everyone was most worried about four areas: the Yongding River in Hebei, the Huai River area, the Han River in Hubei, and the Yi and Shu Rivers in northern Jiangsu. The flood problems in these rivers or these areas cannot be solved fundamentally. In 1950, there was no time to do fundamental cure projects, or although they were done (such as the Yi River), they have not been fully completed. Therefore, if there is excessive rainfall or floods, dangers will inevitably occur. Unfortunately, the Huai River basin has suffered a fairly serious flood this year.

    From late June to mid-July, rainfall in the Huai River basin was concentrated, continuous and universal. Zhengyangguan reached 628.3 mm, and Bengbu reached 532.0 mm, both exceeding the rainfall in the same period in 1931 by more than 100 mm. The flood peaks of the main and tributary streams in the upper reaches of the Huai River converged in Zhengyangguan successively, resulting in the highest water level of 24.74 meters (zero point of the abandoned Yellow River estuary) on July 18, exceeding the water level of 1931 by 0.69 meters. The main and tributary streams of the Huai River above Zhengyangguan then overflowed in advance. After that, the floodwaters flowed down, resulting in the highest water level in Bengbu of 21.19 meters, exceeding the water level in 1931 by 0.98 meters. The measured flow rate reached 8,437 cubic meters per second, close to the estimated flow rate of 8,700 cubic meters per second in 1931. The main and tributary streams below Zhengyangguan also breached in many places successively. Preliminary statistics in northern Anhui show that the affected farmland in severely affected areas is 22.5 million mu, and the affected farmland in lightly affected areas is 9.12 million mu, totaling 31.62 million mu. The population in severely affected areas is 3 million, and the population in lightly affected areas is 6.98 million, totaling 9.98 million. In terms of quantity and degree, they all exceeded the floods in the same area in 1949 and 1931.

    The basic reasons for the flood in the Huai River basin are: first, the impact of the Yellow River capturing the Huai River. Before 1938, the Yellow River captured the Huai River twice. Once in 1194, the Yellow River captured the old channel of the Si River to enter the Huai River, and once in 1494, the Yellow River entered the Huai River from the current abandoned Yellow River. In 1855, the Yellow River began to enter the sea from the current channel. During the 661 years of the Yellow River capturing the Huai River, the estuary of the Huai River into the sea was silted up, the Hongze Lake gradually expanded, and it had to take the road through the lakes of Baoying and Gaoyou to enter the Yangtze River. With the estuary not smooth, the Huai River often flooded. In 1938, Chiang Kai-shek breached the Yellow River dike at Huayuankou, forming the tragic situation of the third capture of the Huai River. Although Huayuankou was blocked in 1947, the ten years of flooding caused fundamental changes in the Huai River basin. Previously, only the estuary was sick, but at this point, the entire basin, upper, middle, and lower reaches, were sick. The original ditch system was generally silted up, and the tributaries were more severely silted up at the confluence of the main stream, forming a distention disease. The Hongze Lake was high and shallow, reducing the water storage capacity by nearly half, thus forming a situation of "heavy rain, heavy disaster, light rain, light disaster, no rain, drought disaster." Second, the relationship of terrain: the sloping water area in northern Anhui is high in the north and low in the south. The southern dike of the Yellow River has become the watershed of this area. The rivers flow from the northwest to the southeast and converge into the Huai River. In the mountainous area south of the Huai River and west of the Ying River, all the forests have been cut down, and crops or tea trees and poria are planted on the slopes. Water and soil cannot be maintained, and sediment is deposited in the river channel, and the river channel is blocked day by day. The flood is concentrated faster and the flood peak is higher day by day. In addition, this year's rainfall was particularly heavy, and there were also shortcomings in spring construction and flood control, which caused the particularly heavy flood in the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River.

    V. Disaster Situation Comparison and Disaster Relief Measures

    From the perspective of the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River in northern Anhui, this year's flood exceeded those of 1949 and 1931. But from a national perspective, this year's flood is much smaller than those of 1931 and 1949, as can be seen from the following table:

    Item	Affected Farmland (10,000 mu)	Affected Population (10,000 people)
    1950	4738	998
    1949	12056	4015
    1931	15785	5270
    Compared with 1949	Reduced by 7318	Reduced by 3017
    Compared with 1931	Reduced by 11047	Reduced by 4272

    Remarks: 1. In 1950, most of the 15.76 million mu of flooded farmland outside the Huai River basin has now been rescued; at least 13 million mu of the affected farmland in the Huai River basin can also be replanted with crops.

    2. The 1950 figures are based on recent incomplete statistics. Only the Huai River has statistics on the affected population, which are temporarily included for comparison.

    3. The 1949 figures include some other disasters.

    This shows that although there are shortcomings in this year's spring construction and flood control, the achievements are great. From a national perspective, the current flood control work has entered an important key stage. Early rice in the south of the Yangtze River is approaching maturity (harvest in some areas has already begun), and crops in North China are also in the tillering stage. Therefore, vigorously defeating the flood has become an urgent task for flood control headquarters at all levels.

    In terms of disaster relief measures, after Fuyang reported the disaster on July 6, northern Anhui immediately made emergency arrangements to strengthen flood control, and allocated 10 million jin of grain, and sent Deputy Director Zheng to lead the rescue. On the 11th, the East China Financial and Economic Committee instructed the departments of water conservancy, agriculture and forestry, finance, civil affairs, and health to form an inspection committee to northern Anhui with 20 million jin of grain to assist in the rescue. Up to now, a total of 100 million jin of emergency relief grain has been allocated. On the 14th, an emergency flood control conference was held in Bengbu. On the 30th, a conference of commissioners and county heads was held in Hefei to determine the plan for production and disaster relief and the policy for river management. Vice Chairman Zeng Shan of East China personally participated and presided over the meeting. Chairman Mao was very concerned about this flood and instructed that the Huai River should be treated as soon as possible in the shortest possible time to relieve the people's suffering. Under this series of concrete measures and the heroic rescue of the cadres, the masses and the People's Liberation Army, the disaster victims were able to survive safely, and the number of deaths and collapsed houses was far less than in 1931. The work of rescuing and draining water and replanting late autumn crops has already begun in the farmland. By mid-July, Fuyang had drained one million mu, and Woyang County had drained more than 4,000 hectares. By July 27, more than 90% of the flooded land in the suburbs of Fuyang had been replanted. Yongcheng County is preparing to replant 600,000 mu of late autumn crops. Rescue work in other counties is also being launched. According to preliminary estimates, at least 13 million mu of the affected farmland in northern Anhui can be replanted.

    Other flood-stricken areas of water systems have also carried out vigorous rescue and plugging of breaches, so that the affected areas can be reduced.

    VI. Future Policy - Eliminate Floods with Emphasis in Five Years

    In order to guarantee agricultural production and relieve the people's suffering, we propose to eliminate floods with emphasis in five years. Is this possible? Our answer is yes.

    First of all, we have a people's democratic government that wholeheartedly serves the people. Water conservancy construction is no longer neglected by the government and is listed as a major construction project. At the same time, under the leadership of the People's Government today, it is possible to combine administration, technology, and the masses, creating superior conditions. Work such as embankment restoration and flood control, and soil and water conservation, which rely on large-scale mass movements, can also rise up on a voluntary basis.

    Secondly, the unprecedented unification of the country and the unprecedented establishment of government prestige make it possible for us to handle water conservancy problems in a unified and comprehensive manner. The contradictions between the upper and lower reaches, the contradictions between the main and tributary streams, and the contradictions between provinces A and B can all be resolved under the principle of small interests obeying large interests, partial obedience to the whole, and current interests obeying long-term interests. Therefore, fundamental cure work can be planned, and various departments can be linked to gradually move towards implementation. And because of the elimination of bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism, it is possible to choose the most favorable and economical way to carry out flood control work.

    Thirdly, the Chinese people have long-term experience in the struggle against water, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, it is possible to use the latest technology to build great projects such as reservoirs.

    These are the unprecedentedly favorable conditions for us to accomplish our mission.

    In concrete work, the Huai River Basin's fundamental cure plan will be implemented early, opening up a sea channel in the lower reaches, initially regulating the channel into the Yangtze River, dredging and regulating the main and tributary streams in the middle reaches, and building a large number of canals and ditches, building reservoirs in the upper reaches, and combining soil and water conservation to close mountains for afforestation, so that the Huai River flood can be basically eliminated.

    In the North China water system, the Guanting Reservoir will be built on the Yongding River, the independent inflow of the Daqing River into the sea will be handled, and the lower reaches of the Chaobai River will be regulated, basically eliminating the Yongding River flood and reducing the disasters of other rivers.

    In the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin, large-scale soil and water conservation, flood interception and storage, and other works are planned. In the lower reaches, construction and defense will be strengthened to prevent breaches. The Yellow River will be stuck in its current place and managed.

    In the Yangtze River Basin, lakes will be regulated to achieve the purpose of flood storage and reclamation, and the Han River will be regulated to eliminate floods in the lower reaches of the Han River and Hankou.

    Dike construction and reservoir construction projects will also be carried out in the rivers of Northeast China.

    These concrete works will be launched successively within five years.

    The project is difficult and great, but the Chinese people will definitely be able to defeat the floods. After defeating the US-Chiang reactionaries, the Chinese people will firmly shoulder this glorious and great task.

　　为彻底克服水患而奋斗
    孙晓村
    一、一九四九年的水灾
    一九四九年的水灾，是一九三一年以后最大的一次。一九三一年的水灾，主要灾区在江淮流域，而一九四九年则范围比较更广，总计受灾田亩达一亿亩以上，损失粮食百余亿斤，受灾人口达四千万人，其他房屋、牲畜、农具等直接间接损失更无法估计。按区域论，以皖北、苏北、鲁南、冀东，以及平原的湖西受灾最重，而辽西、湖北、湖南、皖南、苏南次之。按流域论，以淮河流域、潮白河流域及长江中下游区受灾最重，而辽河流域、珠江流域次之。
    水灾产生的主要原因在那里？我们可以肯定的说：是由于国民党反动派长期统治的恶果。翻开中国历史来看，中国人民与水作斗争是一件大事。过去每一朝代社会的安定不安定、统治基础的稳固不稳固，能否注意到水利工作是重要条件之一。国民党反动派当政二十余年，对于关系全国人民生计的水利工作，却一味敷衍搪塞，到了后半期，还做了不少与水利工作相反的事，使各地原有的水利工程，长期失修而残破不堪，因此水灾的周期性日渐缩短，水灾区域日渐扩展，受灾程度日渐加深。到一九三八年，蒋介石在花园口扒开了黄河大堤，黄水由沙河入淮，造成广大的黄泛区，给这一区域的人民带来了长期的灾害，而蒋介石匪帮在水利工作上所造的罪孽，也就到达了最高峰。
    在去年的水灾地区中，老解放区，由于人民政府的坚强领导，行政、技术、群众三者结合，与洪水作了坚决的斗争，因而取得了胜利，缩小了灾区，如黄河陕州流量，虽超过一万秒立方公尺，但没有溃决，保卫了千百万人民的生命财产。新解放的地区，更由于人民政府领导大力抢救，不但使水灾停止发展，并抢救出不少被淹田亩，以华东而论，一九四九年即抢救出被淹田亩总数四千余万亩的百分之四十二。在与洪水搏斗中，干部群众中都创造了不少可歌可泣的英勇事迹，为中国人民今后的治水斗争，打下了一些坚实的基础。
    二、一九五○年的水利计划及半年来的工作成就
    去年十月，中央人民政府成立，鉴于水灾的严重，急欲解除人民的深重痛苦，因此在十一月间，便召开了各解放区水利联席会议，决定水利建设的基本方针是：防止水患，兴修水利，以达发展生产的目的。工作重点：在受洪水威胁的地区，着重于防洪排水，在干旱地区，着重于开渠灌溉，关内关外总的水利事业费达十余亿斤小米。这数目，在中国历史上是空前的。那时人民政府刚成立，在肃清残敌、保证数百万军政人员的供给，调运粮食救灾备荒，有重点的恢复经济三大主要财政任务之下，拿出这么多钱来兴修水利，可以看出人民政府对消除水患的决心。
    一九五○年水利事业费的分配，就全国范围来说，防洪排水约占全部事业费的百分之七十三，开渠灌溉约占百分之十九，勘测研究约占百分之四点七，其余约占百分之三点三。从各区来说，分配情形如下表：
      区别    华东    中南      华北     西北       东北项目（百分比）防洪       九四·六  九○·二  六一·七     六·一  三一·八灌溉         一·三    四·三  二八·二   七九·四  三七·○其他         四·一    五·五  一○·一   一四·五  三一·二
    由此可以显著看出，在一九五○年的水利事业计划中，防洪工作是最主要的。
    在全国范围以内，防洪、灌溉、排水、航道整理治本等工程，计划土方数量约三亿六千余万方，石方数量约一百一十五万方，上半年已做土方三亿六千余万方（包括华东区地方举办工程三千五百四十万方），石方一百六十万方。其中防洪工程所完成土方数量计三一、○八二万方，超过一九三一年大水灾后，从那年冬起至一九三二年止全国范围内完成的土方数一亿一千六百万方的二点六倍以上，这一成绩是空前的。
    动员民工方面，根据不完全的统计，达四百六十九万人。
    在结合救灾上，华东区统计动员民工二百九十万人，结合救灾人数达五百万人以上，在全国范围以内，因修堤而度过灾荒的，当在一千万人左右。
    这些成就，主要的是由于各级领导上的重视及群众对兴修水利的迫切要求，因而掀起了空前的伟大治水运动所获得的。
  三、洪水的考验
    春修工程是防汛的物质基础，防汛是春修工程的考验，而防汛的组织力量，则是掌握这一物质基础，充分发挥作用的关键，所以在汛期未到来之先，中央水利部即召开了全国防汛会议，决定今年的防汛方针与任务，解决防汛工作的组织领导、防汛经费及报汛办法等问题。在防汛会议上，根据各河流的不同情况及春修工程成就，规定了各河流“保线、保面、保水位、保流量”的具体任务，保证去年被灾田亩中的七千万亩，在发生与去年同样洪水的条件下免遭水灾。
    防汛会议闭幕之后，中央防汛指挥部及各地区防汛指挥部即先后成立，进入了汛期。
    最近两个多月来，永定河已经过六次洪水，以八月初洪水为最大，四日芦沟桥水位涨至大沽零点以上六四·四○公尺，超过一九四九年水位一·二○公尺，流量估计达二七○○秒立方公尺，超过一九四九年流量数倍，分流入小清河后，水位即相继降落。华北其他各河亦因八月以来，各地连续大雨，而普遍上涨，最大流量都超过去年一倍至四倍，在此长期艰苦过程中，由于党政军民拚命的搏斗，获得了很大的成绩，南运河支干及子牙河本流未决口，滏阳河未漫决，永定河多处险工都化险为夷，滦河未出险，潮白河新旧道均未决口。但以今年山洪沥水过大，各河支流未暇修整，因此大清河、蓟运河、滹沱河等发生漫决，淹地四五○万亩。
    黄河中下游水势平稳，仅绥远宁夏因三月间黄河解冻，冰凌阻水，受灾百万亩。
    苏北的新沂河，已经过两次洪水考验，没有出事。
    长江珠江等河小有决溢，基本上算是安全过去。
    根据最近的不完全统计，除皖北淮河流域外，全国范围以内，受灾面积约一五七六万亩，其中大部分是一度被淹，现在已经抢救出来。以今年各地雨量及洪水量来说，半年来的水利工作是有成就的。我们应当认清这一点，就是假若没有这些努力，假若不花上这么多经费，今年各地的水灾情况，不会比去年小多少的。
   四、淮河流域出了乱子
    在今年的全部水利工作中，大家最担心的有四个区域：一是河北的永定河，二是淮河区域，三是湖北的汉水，四是苏北的沂沭河，由于这几条河或这几个区域的水灾问题，不是从根本上下手，不可能解决问题的，而一九五○年还来不及作治本的工程，或者虽然做了（如沂河），还没有全部完成，因此，如遇到过大的雨量或洪水，难免不发生危险的。不幸，淮河流域今年又发生相当严重的水灾。
    自六月下旬至七月中旬，淮河流域降雨集中连续普遍，正阳关达六二八·三公厘，蚌埠达五三二·○公厘，均超过一九三一年同时期雨量一○○公厘以上。淮河上游干支流洪水峰先后在正阳关会合，造成七月十八日的最高水位二四·七四公尺（废黄河口零点）超过一九三一年水位○·六九公尺，正阳关以上淮河干支流遂先期漫决。此后洪流下泄，造成蚌埠最高水位二一·一九公尺，超过一九三一年水位○·九八公尺。实测流量达八、四三七秒立方公尺，接近一九三一年推算流量八、七○○秒立方公尺，正阳关以下干支流遂亦相继决口多处。皖北区初步统计，受灾田亩重灾区计二二五○万亩，轻灾区计九一二万亩，共三一六二万亩，重灾区人口计三○○万人，轻灾区人口计六九八万人，共计九九八万人；从数量上及程度上看都超过一九四九年及一九三一年同区域内的水灾。
    淮河流域水灾发生的基本原因是：第一，黄河夺淮的影响，一九三八年以前，黄河夺淮凡两次，一在一一九四年，黄水夺泗水故道以入淮，一在一四九四年黄水由今废黄河以入淮，至一八五五年，黄河始由今道入海。黄河夺淮的六六一年间，使淮河入海尾闾淤塞，洪泽湖日渐扩充，并不得不取道宝应高邮诸湖以入于江。尾闾不畅，淮水遂常泛滥。一九三八年蒋介石在花园口扒开了黄堤，形成第三次夺淮的惨局，花园口虽在一九四七年堵住了，但十年的汜滥，使淮河流域起了基本上的变化，以前只尾闾受病，到此则全流域上中下游都受病。原有沟洫系统普遍淤平，支流入干流处淤塞得更厉害，形成臌胀病。洪泽湖高仰，缩小蓄水容量几达一半，因此形成了“大雨大灾，小雨小灾，不雨旱灾”的局面。第二，地形的关系：淮北坡水区域，北高而南低，黄河南堤成了这区域的分水脊，河流自西北向东南，均汇入于淮河。而淮河以南颍河以西的山水区域，森林全部砍伐，斜坡上种植庄稼或茶树茯苓，水土不能保持，泥沙沉积于河槽中，而河道日塞，洪水集中愈速，而洪峰日高。加以今年雨量特大，春修工程和防汛，亦有缺点，故造成淮河中上游特大的水灾。
  五、灾情比较及救灾措施
    从皖北淮河中上游来说，今年的水灾是超过一九四九年和一九三一年的。但就全国范围来说：今年的水灾却比一九三一年及一九四九年要小得多，这由下表可以看出：项目被灾田亩（万亩）被灾人口（万人）一九五○   四、七三八         九九八一九四九   一二、○五六       四、○一五一九三一   一五、七八五       五、二七○较一九四九   减七、三一八       减三、○一七较一九三一   减一一、○四七     减四、二七二
    备注：一、一九五○年被淹田亩内，淮河流域以外的一、五七六万亩，现在已大部分抢救出来；淮河流域的被灾田亩，也最少有一千三百万亩可以补种庄稼。
    二、一九五○年数字，根据最近的不完全统计，被灾人口仅淮河有统计，暂列入作比较。
    三、一九四九年数字包括一部分其他灾害。
    这说明：今年的春修工程和防汛虽存在着缺点，但成就是很大的。就全国范围看来，现防汛工作已进入一重要关键，江南早稻已届熟期（部分地区已秋收），华北地区农作物亦在莠穗，故大力战胜洪水，已成为各级防汛指挥部紧急的任务。
    在救灾措施上，七月六日阜阳报灾后，皖北方面即紧急布置，加强防汛，并拨粮一、○○○万斤，派郑副主任带船抢救。十一日华东财委会责成水利、农林、财政、民政、卫生各部组成皖北视察委员会携粮二、○○○万斤前往协助抢救。到现在止，急救粮前后已拨到一亿斤。十四日在蚌埠召开紧急防汛会议。三十日在合肥召开专员县长会议，决定生产救灾方案及治河方针，华东曾山副主席亲自参加主持。毛主席对于这次水灾非常关念，曾指示尽可能于最短期间，治好淮河，早日解除人民痛苦。这一系列的具体措施及在干部群众解放军的英勇抢救之下，灾民得以安全生还，死亡人数及倒塌房屋远较一九三一年为少。田亩方面抢险排水补种晚秋的工作已经展开，阜阳至七月中旬即脱地百万亩，涡阳县脱出四千余顷，阜阳城郊被淹地，至七月二十七日已补种百分之九十以上，永城县准备抢种晚秋六十万亩，其他各县抢救工作也在发动，据初步估计，皖北被灾田亩可以补种者至少约一千三百万亩。
    其他各水系水灾区也进行了大力抢救和堵塞决口工作，使受灾地区得以缩小。
    六、今后的方针——五年内要有重点的消灭水患
    为了保障农业生产，解除人民痛苦，我们提出五年内要有重点的消灭水患，这是可能的吗？我们的回答是肯定的。
    首先，我们有忠心为人民服务的人民民主政权，兴修水利不再被政府所轻视而被列为主要的建设事业。同时，在今天人民政府领导下，能够使行政、技术、群众三者结合，创造了优越的条件，像复堤防汛，像水土保持这样倚靠大规模群众运动的工作，也能在自觉的基础上，高涨起来。
    其次，是全国空前的统一，政府威信空前的建立，使我们有可能通盘的统一的来处理水利问题，上下游的矛盾，本支流的矛盾，甲乙省的矛盾，都可以在小利服从大利，部分服从整体，目前利益服从长远利益的原则下，而获得解决。因此治本工作能够有计划的，各部门互相连系的，逐步走向实施。并且因官僚资本主义封建主义的消灭，有可能选择最有利最经济的途径，来进行防洪工作。
    第三、中国人民的治水斗争，已有长期的经验，加以苏联友邦的援助，有可能采用最新式的技术，来建设水库等伟大工程。
    这些便是我们达成任务的空前有利条件。
    在具体工作上，淮河流域治本计划，将提早实施下游开辟入海水道，初步整理入江水道，中游疏浚整理干支流，并大量开筑渠道沟洫，上游建筑蓄水库，并结合水土保持封山育林，这样可以基本上消灭淮河水灾。
    华北水系将于永定河上建筑官厅水库，办理大清河独流入海减河工程，整理潮白河下游，基本上消灭永定河水灾，及减轻其他各河的灾害。
    黄河流域中上游筹划大规模水土保持拦洪蓄水等工作，下游加强修防，不准溃决，把黄河粘住在现有地方，予以治理。
    长江流域，整理湖泊，以达蓄洪垦殖的目的，治理汉江，免除汉江下游及汉口水灾。
    东北各河流亦将进行筑堤建库工程。
    这些具体工作，都将在五年内相继展开。
    工程是艰难的，伟大的，但中国人民一定能够战胜洪水的。中国人民在战胜美蒋反动派之后，将坚定地担负起这一光荣伟大的任务来。
