　　"Daughter of China" Screened in the Soviet Union

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st. The Chinese film "Daughter of China," which won the "People's Liberation Struggle Award" at the Fifth International Film Festival, began screening in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union on the 1st. This is the first film from the new China to be shown in the Soviet Union. Dubrovinina, Deputy Minister of Education of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, who visited China last year, wrote an article in the "Culture and Life" newspaper, praising it as: The Northeast Film Studio of China has created a brilliant realistic work. In this film, we see our friends and brothers – the glorious Chinese people, and see how they, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, carry out the sacred War of Resistance Against Japan. The struggle of the heroic Chinese people is a model of boundless loyalty to the motherland and extreme hatred for the enemy, a model of self-sacrifice and perseverance. This characteristic makes the Chinese people an invincible force in the struggle against Japanese imperialism and American imperialism.

　　“中华女儿”在苏联放映
    【新华社莫斯科一日电】在第五届国际电影比赛大会上荣获“人民解放斗争奖”的中国影片“中华女儿”，从一日起在莫斯科及苏联各地放映。这是在苏联放映的第一部新中国影片。曾于去年访问我国的苏联俄罗斯联邦教育部副部长杜伯洛维娜，在《文化与生活》报上撰文评介称：中国的东北电影制片厂创造了天才的现实主义的作品。在这部影片里，我们看到了我们的朋友和弟兄——光荣的中国人民，看到他们如何在中国共产党领导下进行神圣的抗日战争。英勇的中国人民的斗争，是对于祖国无限忠诚和对敌人极度仇恨的模范，是自我牺牲和坚韧不屈的模范。这种特色使得中国人民在反对日本帝国主义及美国帝国主义的斗争中，成为不可战胜的力量。
