Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: Under the leadership of the Subei Administrative Region Flood Control Headquarters, the people of the region are now carrying out large-scale flood prevention work on the embankments of the Grand Canal and the Yangtze River. The Grand Canal is the main outlet for the Huai River to enter the Yangtze River and flow into the sea after passing through Baoying and Gaoyou Lakes. Therefore, the rising Huai River water directly threatens the safety of the Grand Canal's embankments. Currently, 300,000 people from ten counties along the Grand Canal, including Baoying, Gaoyou, and Jiangdu, have been投入 into the flood prevention work, of which 58,000 have joined organizations such as rescue teams. The 30,000 cubic meter Grand Canal embankment reinforcement project in Huai'an County has been completed, and three culverts on the Grand Canal embankment in Gaoyou County have been blocked. In order to strengthen flood prevention communication and facilitate nighttime embankment protection and rescue, telephone lines have been erected in various dangerous sections of the Grand Canal, and electric lights are being installed. On the night of August 10th, leakage occurred at the base of the Zhongba dangerous project (located in Gaoyou County) on the Grand Canal, causing the inner revetment (reinforcement project on the land side of the embankment) to collapse for more than 20 meters, and the middle outer slope to sink into the water, a very dangerous situation. After more than 10,000 people from nearby masses, troops, and Gaoyou County government cadres fought against the flood for 16 hours, the dangerous project was finally turned from danger to safety. Currently, in the Lixiahe area, the people of seven counties, including Xinghua and Taixing, have launched an enthusiastic movement to donate flood prevention materials.

In order to reduce the threat to the Grand Canal embankments when the Huai River flood flows eastward, the Subei Flood Control Headquarters had already opened the Changjiang Sanba (three dams leading to the Yangtze River: Lanjiang Dam, Bihu Dam, Chushan Dam) on the Grand Canal, preparing to empty Baoying and Gaoyou Lakes before the Huai River flood arrives, in order to缓和 the Huai River flood. In addition, the Subei People's Administrative Office convened an emergency meeting of the county heads of eight counties in the Lixiahe area on August 7th, deciding that each county should make preparations in advance, and open the Sanba leading to the sea (Cheluo Dam, Nanguan Dam, Xinba Dam) on the Grand Canal when the water situation in the Grand Canal is critical, so as to plannedly reduce the flood inundation area. Currently, Hui Yuyu, Director of the Subei People's Administrative Office, Xiao Wangdong, Secretary of the Subei District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and others have moved to Gaoyou to work, in order to better lead the flood prevention work on the Grand Canal.

On the Jiangfang front, ten counties in the Taizhou and Nantong Special Zones along the Yangtze River, including Liuhe, Jingjiang, Haimen, and Qidong, have already passed the two flood seasons of the Yangtze River on July 18th and August 1st, and are now actively preparing to迎 接 the largest annual tidal surge on August 15th. The flood prevention headquarters of each county have gone to the embankments to work. The Taizhou Special Zone has carried out reinforcement projects on dangerous works along the river embankment. In addition to repairing the old embankment's dangerous projects, the Nantong Special Zone also newly built a new embankment section in Haimen.

Currently, the Subei Military Region, the Subei District Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Subei Democratic Women's Federation, and the Subei Federation of Trade Unions have all issued orders and instructions one after another, calling on the Subei People's Armed Forces and the broad masses of workers, youth, and women to bravely participate in embankment protection, rescue, and other work.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th: Initial victory has been achieved in the Subei Grand Canal flood prevention work. Under the efforts of the district flood control headquarters and the masses along the river, some critical situations in various sections of the Grand Canal since the beginning of this month have been overcome. The Huai River flood peak in northern Anhui gradually entered the Grand Canal in early August. By around the 10th, due to the high water level, more than 100 dangerous points continuously appeared on the 500+ *huali* embankment south of Zaohe Town (northwest of Suqian City). The Zhongba in Gaoyou County was also on the verge of collapsing. At that time, in addition to urgently mobilizing 150,000 people near the eastern embankment of the Grand Canal to conduct surprise rescues on the embankment, the Subei Flood Control Headquarters and the flood control headquarters of various sections of the Grand Canal also built stone weirs on the western embankment of the Grand Canal, and provided day and night protection to places that were not yet in danger. As a result, the dangerous works at Zhongba, Tieniunwan, and other places were turned from danger to safety. On the 16th, the water level at Gaoyou Station on the Grand Canal exceeded the dangerous water level by 0.01 meters. Because preparations were made in advance, the embankment line did not collapse.

Currently, the dangerous period for the Grand Canal has not yet passed; although the water level in the middle and upper reaches of the Huai River has been continuously decreasing in recent days, the water levels in Gaoyou and Baoying Lakes are still rising, and the water level in the Grand Canal has not yet reached its peak, and the Huai River still has the possibility of a second flood peak. The crisis of tidal顶托and the combined rise of the Yi (River) and Huai (River) has not passed, and a greater crisis is that the Grand Canal may still be attacked by northwestern gales. That would not only raise the water level of the Grand Canal, but also create huge waves that would endanger the embankment. Now the Subei Flood Control Headquarters has called on the people in various places along the river to firmly戒松懈麻痹and is strengthening the flood prevention organization and carrying out a comprehensive inspection and remedy of the Grand Canal embankment project in order to completely prevent floods.

　　苏北人民全力防汛
    运河防汛工作已获初步胜利  正积极防治淮洪及长江潮汛
    【新华社上海十五日电】苏北行政区人民在该区防汛指挥部领导下现正大规模展开里运河堤和长江堤的防汛工作。里运河是淮河经宝应、高邮两湖后入长江出海的主要出路，因此，淮河水涨直接威胁里运河的堤防安全。现里运河沿岸宝应、高邮、江都等十县人民，已有三十万人投入运河的防汛工作，其中有五万八千人参加了抢险队等组织。淮安县的三万公方运河堤加修工程已经完成，高邮县段运河堤上的三个涵洞已经堵闭。为着加强防汛联络和便利黑夜护堤抢险，里运河各险工地段现已架设电话，并正在装置电灯。八月十日夜，里运河中坝（位于高邮县境）险工坝脚渗漏，致使内戗（堤段靠陆地面的培修工程）塌陷二十余公尺，中部外坡下沉入水，情势非常危险。经附近群众、部队及高邮县机关干部万余人与洪水奋战十六小时后，终使该险工转危为安。现里下河区域，兴化、泰兴等七县人民已掀起热烈的捐献防汛器材运动。
    为减轻淮河洪水东下时对运河堤防的威胁，苏北防汛指挥部早已开放运河的归（长）江三坝（拦江坝、壁虎坝、褚山坝），准备在淮洪下注前，腾空宝应、高邮等湖，以缓和淮河洪水。此外，苏北人民行署又于八月七日召集里下河区域八个县县长开紧急会议，决定各县事先作好准备工作，在运河水情危急时开放运河归海三坝（车逻坝、南关坝、新坝），以便有计划地缩小洪水泛区。现苏北人民行署主任惠浴宇、中共苏北区党委会书记萧望东等均已移至高邮办公，以便更好地领导运河防汛工作。
    在江防方面，沿长江的泰州、南通两专区的六合、靖江、海门、启东等十县都已经度过长江七月十八日与八月一日的两次汛期，现正积极准备迎接八月十五日的全年最大潮汛。各县防汛总队部已上堤办公。泰州专区对沿江堤岸险工已进行加修工程。南通专区除修补了旧堤险工外，还新建了海门段新堤。
    目前苏北军区、青年团苏北区工作委员会、苏北民主妇联、苏北总工会等，均已先后发出命令和指示，号召苏北人民武装部队及广大工人、青年、妇女英勇参加护堤抢险等工作。
    【新华社上海十九日电】苏北运河防汛工作已获初步胜利。在该区防汛总指挥部和沿河群众的努力防护下，本月上旬以来运河各段之若干危急情况已经度过。皖北淮河洪峰于八月上旬逐渐侵入运河，至十日左右，运河堤防因水位过高，在皂河镇（宿迁城西北）以南五百余华里的堤防曾连续出险百余处。高邮县境之运河中坝亦几至溃决。当时苏北防汛总指挥部及运河各段防汛指挥部除紧急动员运河东堤附近十五万群众上堤突击抢险外，同时加筑运河西堤石堰，对未出险处更日夜防护，结果运河中坝及铁牛湾等各处险工已转危为安。十六日，运河高邮站水位已超过危险水位零点零一公尺，因事先有准备，故堤线亦未发生溃决。
    目前运河危险期尚未过去；淮河中上游水位近日虽连续下降，但高邮、宝应两湖水位则仍在上涨，运河水位尚未到达顶点，而且淮河仍有发生第二次洪峰的可能。江潮顶托、沂（河）淮（河）并涨的危机还没有过去，更大的危机是运河尚有遭受西北风狂风袭击的可能。那样不仅会抬高运河水位，且将掀起巨浪危及堤身。现苏北防汛指挥部已号召沿河各地人民力戒松懈麻痹，并正加强防汛组织及进行运河堤工的全面检查与补救工作，以求彻底防止水灾。
