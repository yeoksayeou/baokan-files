　　Lack of Investigation and Research·Negligence of Safety Precautions
    Landslide Accident Occurs at Langxiang Quarry in Northeast China
    [Our Qiqihar Dispatch] At the landslide site between Langxiang and Dailing on the Suihua-Jiamusi Railway line in Northeast China, falling rocks injured 27 workers on June 27th. Among them, Fu Wensheng, a track maintenance worker from Taoshan, and Shen Deyuan, a temporary worker, died on the spot; Section Chief Liu Wanchang, track maintenance director Jiang Fuxiang, and nine others were seriously injured. The area is bordered by the South Cha River on one side and a steep stone mountain 70 meters high on the other. To prevent rockfall accidents, the Tieli Engineering Section sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys and determined that it was necessary to blast down a large rock 45 meters above the ground. Starting on June 25th, 61 workers were mobilized, led by the section chief, to begin work. It was stipulated that the line would be closed from 11:02 to 14:00 each day from June 26th to July 4th. The first day of work went smoothly, but on the second day, unexpectedly, more than 100 tons of rocks fell. To ensure timely traffic, all employees immediately worked hard to clear the rocks, even the safety supervisor participated. Unexpectedly, another 170 to 180 tons of rocks fell suddenly, leaving no time to dodge, resulting in the unfortunate accident. This also blocked train traffic for 33 and a half hours, affecting train operations 16 times and causing delays 8 times.
    The injured workers were immediately sent to Qiqihar and Suihua Railway Hospitals for treatment and are now out of danger. The deceased employees were also buried separately, and memorial services were held. Upon hearing the news, the Labor Protection Department of the Northeast Regional Committee of the Railway Trade Union immediately brought 20 million Northeast currency to express condolences. Compensation for the deceased and injured workers is also being processed.
    The main reasons for this unfortunate accident are that the leaders of the section lacked experience and did not conduct thorough investigations and research; moreover, they did not solicit the opinions of the workers regarding the progress of the project, and they were negligent in safety precautions. All localities should learn from the painful lessons of this unfortunate accident and prevent similar accidents from occurring. (Liu Jiadi)

　　缺乏调查研究·疏于防护安全
    东北朗乡崩石场发生事故
    【本报齐齐哈尔讯】东北铁路绥（化）佳（木斯）线朗乡、带岭间的崩石现场，于六月二十七日落石砸坏工友二十七名。其中桃山养路工傅文升、临时工沈德元当场身死；段长刘万昌、养路主任姜福祥等九名受了重伤。该地一面是南叉河、一面是高达七十公尺的陡峭石山。为防止落石事故，铁骊工务段派人实地勘测后，认为需将离地四十五公尺高处的巨石崩下。从六月二十五日起，调来六十一名工友，由段长率领开始工作。规定由六月二十六日至七月四日止，每天十一时零二分至十四时为封锁时间。第一天工作很顺利，但第二天却意外的落下了石头一百多吨。为保证按时通车，全体职工立刻紧张的清除石头，连一名安全监视员也参加了。不料突然又落下石头一百七、八十吨，躲也来不及了，因而发生了不幸事故。因此也堵塞火车通行三十三个半钟头，影响列车运行十六次，晚点八次。
    受伤工友当即送齐齐哈尔、绥化铁路医院救治，现在已脱离危险。殉职员工也分别安葬，并举行了追悼会。铁路工会东北地区委员会劳保部闻讯后，当即带了二千万元东北币赶去慰问。殉职及受伤工人的抚恤金也正在办理。
    这次不幸事故的发生，主要原因是该段领导方面既无经验，又未进行周密调查研究；而且对于工程的进行，既未征求工人意见，更疏于防护安全。各地应接受这次不幸事故的惨痛教训，防止类似事故的发生。（刘甲第）
