[Liaodong News] The Liaodong Province Industry Department, during its rectification campaign, focused on inspecting the lack of economic accounting awareness, which has led to a large backlog of products and raw materials in various factories and mines. According to statistics from fifteen factories and mines, unsalable products in the first half of the year resulted in a total backlog of over 460 billion yuan (including 311.5 billion yuan in product backlog – Northeast currency), seriously affecting capital turnover.

The backlog of products and raw materials is caused by the Industry Department's lack of economic accounting awareness and its supply system-based leadership approach. The Industry Department stipulated that all products manufactured by factories and mines should be handed over to the Industry Department, with the Sales Department responsible for unified sales. Factories and mines would request raw materials and cash from the Industry Department as needed. This fostered a dependency mentality in the factories and mines; they would request money from the Industry Department whenever they needed it, without worrying about product sales. The Provincial Industry Department also put forward the slogan "The meat rots in the pot," meaning that internal sales of products between provincial-run factories and mines didn’t need to calculate price differences or consider product quality. This increased costs for purchasers and discouraged sellers from actively lowering costs and improving quality. The department also stipulated that factories and mines should not calculate current value costs, leading some factories and mines to purchase raw materials at high prices, thereby increasing costs. For example, the main raw material for monosodium glutamate produced by the brewing factory is hydrochloric acid. The price per ton increased from 20 million yuan to 75 million yuan, increasing the current value cost by 2.6 times compared to before. The factory didn’t care, and the department didn’t study it well, so production continued. As a result, due to high costs, the monosodium glutamate could not be sold, resulting in a backlog of 4,661 kilograms, worth 20.1 billion yuan. Another manifestation of the lack of economic accounting awareness is the failure to calculate capital turnover periods in factories and mines, the failure to shorten raw material storage periods, and the failure to scientifically determine raw material reserve quantities. They only feared work stoppages and material shortages, leading to large-scale purchases and storage of raw materials. The backlog of raw materials such as gunpowder detonators, fuses, pit props, bones, and logs stored by several factories and mines alone amounted to over 100 billion yuan. When formulating the 1950 production plan, the Industry Department only unilaterally considered the equipment capacity of factories and mines, without properly considering market needs (state orders and market sales), which is also one of the reasons for the product backlog. Taking the production of batteries by the Ceramic Company's Factory One as an example, mass production began before sales channels were found, resulting in a backlog of 12 billion yuan worth of products. The production tasks stipulated by the Industry Department in the past only specified quantity, not quality requirements. As a result, some factories and mines focused only on quantity and neglected quality, producing products that could not be sold. For example, the wine produced by the Tonghua Winery was unsalable due to poor quality, resulting in a backlog of over 11,700 cases, worth 17.9 billion yuan. This is also a major reason for the capital backlog. This backlog directly affected reproduction and made it impossible to solve basic construction investment problems.

After discovering this problem, the Liaodong Province Industry Department convened a special meeting to study solutions. It was decided that: Firstly, the past supply system-based management method should be changed, and factories and mines should be responsible for supply and sales, strengthening the contract system. Secondly, the capital of factories and mines should be determined, and an independent accounting system should be implemented. Cost management should be implemented on a factory and mine basis, changing the accounting method from current value prices to fixed prices for cost calculation. The task of reducing costs for each factory and mine should be determined, and profits should be turned over monthly. At the same time, the storage period of raw materials, the backlog period of reserves and finished products, and the capital turnover period should be determined to establish a cost concept in factories and mines and implement an economic accounting system. Regarding production and sales issues, it was decided to revise the blind parts of the original production plan and re-formulate the production plan based on market sales (including orders from the state), capital status, technology, and equipment. After discussion at the department affairs meeting, the production plans of several factories and mines have been revised.

In addition, efforts will be organized to promote the sale of the over 300 billion yuan worth of backlogged products. In addition to organizing the Tianjin, Shenyang, and Andong Sales Offices to vigorously promote the sale of backlogged products, special personnel will be sent to sign contracts with state trade agencies to open up market sales channels.

　　辽东省工业厅整风重点
    检查产品资金积压现象
    决定改变经营方法，实行厂矿独立会计制度，修正生产计划中的盲目性。
    【辽东讯】辽东省工业厅在整风中，着重检查了缺乏经济核算思想，致造成各厂、矿大量产品与原材料的积压。据十五个厂矿统计，上半年因产品推销不出去，共积压资金四千六百余亿元（其中产品积压三千一百一十五亿元——东北币，下同），严重影响资金周转。
    产品与原材料的积压，是工业厅领导上缺乏经济核算思想，和大供给制的领导方法所造成。工业厅曾规定：厂、矿生产出来的产品全部交工业厅，由供销处统一推销；厂、矿需要原材料和现款就向工业厅要。因而给各厂、矿养成依赖思想，没钱就向工业厅要，产品销路如何则全不管。省工业厅又曾提出过“肉烂在锅里”的口号，即省营厂、矿产品内部自销时，可不计算价格高低；不择品质优劣。因而使购入者增大成本，销出者不积极设法降低成本和提高质量。厅里还规定厂矿不计算现值成本，因而有的厂、矿高价购入原材料，致成本提高。如酿造厂生产的味素，主要原料是盐酸，每吨由二千万元提高到七千五百万元，因而现值成本较从前提高二·六倍，工厂不管，厅里也没很好研究，仍然继续生产下去，结果由于成本高，推销不出去，积压味素达四千六百六十一公斤，价值二百零一亿元。缺乏经济核算思想的另一表现是在厂、矿中不计算资金周转期，不力求缩短原材料储备期和科学的规定原材料储备量，只怕停工待料，大量购入和储存原材料。就以几个厂矿储存的火药雷管、导火线、坑木、骨头、原木等原材料，其积压数目即达一千余亿元。工业厅在制订一九五○年生产计划时，只片面的以厂、矿设备能力出发，没有很好考虑市场需要（国家订货和市场销售），也是造成产品积压原因之一。即以陶瓷公司一厂生产电瓶为例，还没找到销路，就开始了大量生产，结果积压了一百二十亿元的产品。工业厅过去规定的生产任务，只有数量，没有质量要求，因而某些厂矿产生了只求数量忽视质量现象，生产出产品推销不出去。如通化葡萄酒厂出的酒，即因质量不好，积压了一万一千七百余箱，价值一百七十九亿。这也是造成资金积压的一个主要原因。这种积压直接影响了再生产，并使基本建设投资无法解决。
    辽东省工业厅检查出这一问题后，已专门召开会议研究解决办法。决定：首先改变过去供给制经营方法，实行厂、矿负责供销，加强合同制：着手确定厂、矿资金，实行独立会计制度，以厂、矿为单位，实行成本管理，改变以现值价格记账，以固定价格计算成本。确定各厂、矿降低成本任务，按月上缴利润；同时确定原材料储存期间、储备品和成品的积压期间，以及资金周转期间等，以树立厂、矿成本观念，贯彻经济核算制。关于产销问题，决定修正原来生产计划的盲目部分，根据市场销路（包括与国家订货）、资金情况、技术和设备等原则，重新制订生产计划。经过厅务会议讨论，若干厂矿的生产计划已有所修改。
    此外，要组织力量推销已积压的三千多亿的产品。除已组织天津、沈阳、安东三个供销处大力推销积压的产品外，并派专人与国家贸易机关订合同，打开市场销路。
