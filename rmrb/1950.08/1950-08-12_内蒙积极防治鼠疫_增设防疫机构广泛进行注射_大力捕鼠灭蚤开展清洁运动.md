Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, August 8th: The People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is actively carrying out plague prevention and control work, expanding and increasing the number of anti-epidemic organizations. Currently, it is continuing to carry out widespread preventive injections and mass rat-catching and flea-killing campaigns.

The people of Inner Mongolia, who have long suffered from plague disasters, have carried out various effective anti-epidemic struggles under the leadership of the People's Government since liberation. This has reduced the number of cases from 15,710 at the time of liberation to 345 last year, and the number of deaths has also dropped from 13,315 to 196. In order to further strengthen this year's epidemic prevention work and strive to completely eliminate the plague in Inner Mongolia within three to five years, the Inner Mongolia People's Government has determined that the three eastern leagues of Inner Mongolia, Hinggan, Jirem, and Juu Uda, where the plague has been most rampant in recent years, will be the key epidemic prevention areas this year, with Tongliao in Jirem League as the plague prevention and control pilot county. At the same time, two epidemic prevention stations and four prevention and control centers have been added to Hinggan League and Juu Uda League. The original Inner Mongolia Mobile Epidemic Prevention Team and the Jirem League Epidemic Prevention Station have also been expanded, with more than 300 additional cadres. Adhering to the spirit of "prevention is more important than treatment," each station, center, and team has established rat-catching teams, laboratory groups, epidemic prevention and treatment groups, and nursing groups to carry out prevention and control work, focusing on rat-catching and injections. Jirem League, where there are many rats, is the main rat-catching area this year. As of early July, Hinggan, Jirem, and Juu Uda leagues had captured more than 3 million rats, completing 39% of the annual rat-catching task of 11.7 million.

The plague vaccine injection work began in mid-April. In general areas, the first injection has been widely carried out, and areas where plague has occurred continuously for three years have been injected twice. According to statistics from Hinggan, Jirem, and Juu Uda leagues, more than 100,500 people have been injected, of which 67% of the people in Tongliao, where the epidemic was more serious in the past, have been injected. In conjunction with the above-mentioned rat-catching and injection work, cleaning campaigns have also been widely launched. Focusing on epidemic areas, cities, and towns, work is being carried out to remove garbage and manure, and to organize epidemic prevention ditches, flat rooftops, and plastered wall cracks. For example, Ulanhot City has dug and repaired 4,227 meters of epidemic prevention ditches around the city.

Currently, various epidemic prevention organizations are carrying out various epidemic prevention and treatment measures in a timely and effective manner. In mid-June, after the Chahar League Epidemic Prevention Station discovered dead and sick rats in the Zhenglan Banner of the league, it immediately conducted tests and found that the dead rats contained plague bacilli, and 80% of the sick rats had plague. The Epidemic Prevention Station immediately took emergency measures, in addition to general publicity, and banned the export of fur from the epidemic area. Patients with plague were also found in Naiman Banner, Tongliao, and Kailu in Jirem League in May. After the epidemic prevention organizations discovered them, they immediately sent them to the hospital for treatment and thoroughly implemented blockades and isolation. More than 400 members of the Northeast Mobile Epidemic Prevention Team also arrived in Tongliao, Kailu, and other places to assist in prevention and control and vaccine injection work. The spread of the epidemic has now stopped.

The plague situation in the Xilin Gol League and parts of the Chahar League in western Inner Mongolia is much lighter than in eastern Inner Mongolia. Because the area is close to Beijing and Tianjin, the epidemic prevention work is directly undertaken by the Chahar-Mongolia Plague Prevention and Control Institute of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government.

　　内蒙积极防治鼠疫
    增设防疫机构广泛进行注射
    大力捕鼠灭蚤开展清洁运动
    【新华社张家口八日电】内蒙自治区人民政府积极展开防治鼠疫工作，扩大和增设了防疫机械。现正继续紧张进行广泛的预防注射和群众性的捕鼠灭蚤运动。
    长期遭受鼠疫灾害的内蒙人民，解放后在人民政府领导下进行了各种有效的防疫斗争，使发病人数已由解放时的一万五千七百一十人降到去年的三百四十五人，死亡人数也由一万三千三百一十五人降到一百九十六人。为进一步加强今年的防疫工作，争取在三、五年内完全消灭内蒙的鼠疫危害，内蒙人民政府确定以历年来鼠疫最猖獗的内蒙东部的兴安、昭乌达、哲里木三盟为今年防疫重点区，以哲盟通辽为鼠疫防治试验县。同时又在兴安盟、昭乌达盟增设两个防疫站及四个防治所。原有内蒙机动防疫队及哲盟防疫站也同时予以扩大，增加干部三百多人。本“防重于治”的精神，各站、所、队内设立捕鼠队、化验组、防疫处理组及护理组等防疫组织，以捕鼠、注射为重点，分头进行防治工作。鼠类繁多的哲盟为今年主要的捕鼠地区，至七月上旬，哲、昭、兴三盟已捕鼠三百余万只，完成全年捕鼠任务一千一百七十万只的百分之三十九。
    鼠疫生菌注射工作于四月中旬开始，在一般地区已普遍注射一次，三年连续发生鼠疫的地区已注射二次。据哲、昭、兴三盟统计，注射人数已有十万零五千余人，其中过去疫情较重的通辽的人民，百分之六十七进行了注射。配合上述捕鼠、注射工作，清洁运动也普遍展开。以疫区城、镇为重点，进行清除垃圾、粪便和整理防疫沟、平屋地、抹墙缝等工作。如乌兰浩特市即挖修围绕市周的防疫沟四千二百二十七公尺。
    现各防疫组织正及时有效地进行各种防疫治疗。察哈尔盟防疫站于六月中旬在该盟正厢白联合旗发现死鼠和病鼠后，当即进行化验，发现死鼠均保有鼠疫杆菌，病鼠有百分之八十为鼠疫病。该防疫站立即采取紧急措施，除进行一般宣传外，并禁止该疫区皮毛出境。哲盟奈曼旗、通辽、开鲁等地五月间亦曾先后发生鼠疫患者，防疫组织发现后立即将其送入医院治疗，彻底实行封锁和隔离。东北机动防疫队四百余人也到达通辽、开鲁等地，协助进行防治与生菌注射工作，现疫情蔓延已经停止。
    内蒙西部的锡林郭勒盟和察哈尔盟一部分地区，鼠疫情况远较东蒙为轻，因地区邻近京津，防疫工作由中央人民政府卫生部察蒙鼠疫防治所直接担任防治工作。
