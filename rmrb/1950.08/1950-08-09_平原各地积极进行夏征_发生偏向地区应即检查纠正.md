The summer grain collection is being actively carried out in various parts of Pingyuan Province, and some areas have smoothly completed their tasks. However, according to reports from some regions, many errors and deviations are still occurring in the current work. In order to ensure that the task allocation to households is fair and reasonable, and to prepare for the storage and transportation of public grain, the Provincial Government issued instructions to all special districts and municipal people's governments on July 14. In Shan County, Huxi Special District, Liu Village and Liu Lou Village in the 4th, 5th, and 6th districts started collecting grain on the 8th, and by the 9th, they had collected more than 11,000 catties of new public grain and 3,200 catties of past arrears. Wei Xiuzhen, chairman of the women's association in Shitao Village, the 2nd district of Ye County, actively promoted and explained the summer grain collection policy to the masses after returning to the village from the county representative meeting, and led more than 50 households in the village to dry and hand over grain, setting off a wave of grain payment in the village. By the 12th, all 103 households in the village had handed in all the public grain. In Xinxiang County, Xinxiang Special District, in order to ensure reasonable burden, democratic discussions were launched after the county representative meeting in early July, explaining the principle of "one person hiding land, everyone suffers." Villages mobilized to self-report undeclared land, and the statistics from only four districts and twenty villages showed that 11,885 mu of undeclared land were reported. Some districts and villages in Shan County, Huxi Special District, also reported a lot of undeclared land under the call of "reporting undeclared land, no pursuit, no punishment."

	Corruption Affects Mass Grain Delivery
	County Head's Commandist Style

However, in some individual areas, deviations have occurred in the work, seriously affecting the completion of the task. For example, Shan County's first district should have collected more than 1.92 million catties of summer public grain this year, but only 60% was collected by mid-July. The main reasons were unfair distribution, improper reduction and exemption, and corruption by village cadres. For example, Liu Derui, the village chief of Huanghaizi Village, embezzled more than 1,600 catties of public grain, which made the masses think that even if the public grain was handed in, it would still be embezzled, and the later they dragged it, the better, because many arrears in the past had not been cleared and it didn't matter. This further fueled the commandist style of district and village cadres, who believed that "no matter how many times you explain the policy to the masses, it's no use if they don't pay." They didn't further study ways and methods to implement the policy. In addition, there is still a deviation of purely focusing on tasks and neglecting production leadership among district and village cadres in the district. For example, there are still more than 120 summer barren villages in the district, and it is currently the time for weeding, pruning cotton, and accumulating fertilizer; some villages have nothing to eat after handing in grain. However, these issues were not even brought up for discussion at the cadre meetings. The district cadres' thinking is plagued by the erroneous notion of fearing that "discussing production will delay grain collection" and "if we are too precise, the masses will not pay public grain." Some district cadres even said: "We can't calculate accounts for the masses. If we calculate, there won't be enough grain to eat, who will pay public grain? Just simply say how much you should pay, and you have to pay, and the masses will find a way."

	Cadres Careless
	Universally Misjudge Yield

During the grain collection in Anyang County, many villages found that the actual acreage did not match the acreage allocated by the county and district. According to incomplete statistics from 61 villages in eight districts of the county: except for three villages where the county's allocated amount was less than the village's actual amount, the rest were all cases where the allocated amount was higher than the actual amount. The reasons were that the assessed yield was too high, and dry land or dry land that had been converted to paddy land for less than three years was calculated according to paddy land; some forms were printed and filled in incorrectly, causing discrepancies between the total acreage and the total population. These show the extent to which cadres are irresponsible to the people and their careless style! The above errors have been mostly corrected after appeals from various villages. However, some individual districts have shown a lack of responsibility in handling this issue, believing that "it was the village cadres who reported it incorrectly, and the village cadres should be responsible" and are unwilling to correct it.

The counties and districts concerned should, in accordance with policies, conduct in-depth inspections of work and cadres' work styles, and promptly correct and appropriately resolve the above deviations and problems.

　　平原各地积极进行夏征
    发生偏向地区应即检查纠正
    【本报讯】平原省各地麦征工作正积极进行，有些地区已经顺利完成任务。但据若干地区反映：目前工作中仍发生不少错误和偏向。省府为使各地向户分配任务时能做到公平合理，并要求各地做好公粮入仓调运的准备工作，曾于七月十四日向各专署、市人民政府发出指示。湖西专区单县四、五、六区的刘寨、刘娄等村从八日开征，到九日即将新公粮一万一千多斤及过去尾欠三千二百斤征齐。邺县二区石陶村妇代会主席魏秀珍由县代表会回村后，即积极向群众宣传解释夏征政策，并带动全村五十多户晒粮交粮，在全村掀起了缴粮热潮。到十二日为止，全村一百零三户即将全部公粮交齐。新乡专区新乡县为做到负担合理，七月初县代表会后即展开民主讨论，说明“一人瞒地，大家吃亏”的道理，各村发动自报黑地，结果仅四个区二十个村统计，即报出黑地一万一千八百八十五亩。湖西专区的单县有的区村亦在“报出黑地、不追不罚”的号召下，报出不少黑地。
  贪污影响群众交粮
  县长命令主义作风
    但也有个别地区工作中发生了偏向，严重地影响了任务的完成。如单县一区今年共应征夏季公粮一百九十二万余斤，但到七月中旬仅征起百分之六十，其主要原因是分配不公、减免不当与村干部贪污等。如黄海子村长刘德瑞曾贪污公粮一千六百余斤，使群众认为先交了公粮还不是被贪污了，愈往后拖愈好，因为过去许多尾欠至今未清也没关系；这样，就又助长了区村干部的命令主义作风，认为“对群众讲政策讲一百遍，不交还是没办法”，不去进一步研究贯彻政策的方式方法。此外，该区区村干部中尚存在着单纯任务观点与忽视生产领导的偏向。如该区尚有一百二十余个夏荒村，且当前正值锄苗、打棉杈、积肥时期；还有的村交了粮即没啥吃的了。但这些问题在干部会上，就根本没有提出讨论。在区干部思想上存在着怕“讨论生产误了麦征”、“精打细算群众就不纳公粮了”的错误想法。有的区干部甚至说：“不能给群众算账，一算账粮食不够吃，谁还纳公粮？就干脆说你该出多少，不出不行，拿出后群众自有办法。”
  干部粗枝大叶
  普遍评错产量
    在安阳县麦征中，发生不少村实际地亩与县区分配负担之地亩不符，据该县八个区六十一个村的不完全统计：除三个村县分配数少于村实际数外，余皆系分配数高于实际数。原因有的是评定产量过高，将旱地或旱地变水地不足三年者，按水地负担计算；有的是将表格印错填错，使总地亩与总人口发生出入。这些说明干部对人民不负责任与粗枝大叶的作风已到何种程度！以上错误经各村申诉后，已经大部改正。但也有个别区对处理此项问题表现不够负责，认为“是村干部报错的，应由村干部负责”而不愿纠正。
    上述偏向和问题，各该县区应根据政策，深入检查工作和检查干部作风，及时予以纠正和适当解决。
