　　Invading American Troops in Korea Extremely Fearful
    Walker's "Fight to the Death" Order Cannot Stop the US Military's Continued Retreat
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st Dispatch] The US military commander in Korea, Walker, issued an order on the 29th demanding that his subordinates "fight to the death" and "no longer consider retreat or surrender," which aroused fear among US soldiers. According to a report by Agence France-Presse, after Walker's order was issued, "the entire US military on the Korean front obviously permeated an extremely serious expression. After the unit commanders came out of the meeting, they all wore serious faces and refused to say a word. General Walker told them to hold on or die in battle, which shattered all their possible illusions. On the road leading to the front line, reporters saw several jeeps with the words 'Success or Death' written on them. American soldiers casually wrote such words when they landed on Korean soil. But now they suddenly realized how heavy the meaning of this short sentence was." The dispatch revealed that the American invading army had fallen into a state of panic: "Even a slight breeze blowing through the bushes would trigger American machine gun fire."
    The dispatch also revealed that the US military could not obtain any support from the people in the South Korean war zone within its controlled areas: "American soldiers are left alone in the face of the enemy. Koreans closed their shops and farms, and walked away with their burdens. All that was left was the police. The army was angry to see Koreans crowding the roads with their ox carts, carrying their women and children, especially the young men, because they felt that these people could go to the front line. And when Koreans saw the American convoys passing by them, there was no expression in their eyes, because in their view, all of this was just part of the factors that drove them out of their rice fields."
    Walker's order failed to stop the continued retreat of the US military. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 30th, the US military retreated from Hwanggan (northeast of Yeongdong) on the same day that Walker issued the order.

　　侵朝美军极度恐惧
    瓦克发表“拼死作战”命令阻止不了美军继续败退
    【新华社三十一日讯】侵略朝鲜的美军司令瓦克二十九日发表的要求其部下“拼死作战”，“勿再作后退和投降之想法”的命令，在美军士兵中引起了恐惧的情绪。据法新社记者报道，在瓦克命令发表后，“整个朝鲜战线的美军都显然弥漫着一种极端严重的神情。部队指挥官们开会出来后，都带着一付严重的面孔，一句话都不肯说。瓦克将军叫他们坚守，否则就战死，这句话把他们一切可能还存在的幻想都打破了。在通往前线的公路上，记者看见几辆吉普车上写着‘不成功即成仁’的字句。美国兵在登上朝鲜土地时，顺手写上这样的字句。但现在他们突然间领会到了这句简短的话，意义有多么沉重”。该电透露，美国侵略军已陷于草木皆兵的恐怖之境：“一阵极细微的风吹动了灌木，都会引起美国机枪的射击。”
    该电又透露，美军在其控制地区无法获得南朝鲜战区人民的任何支持：“美国士兵被孤零零地放在敌人面前。朝鲜人关闭了他们的店铺和农场，背上他们的包袱走开了。留下的只有警察。军队看见朝鲜人赶着他们的牛车挤在公路上，带着他们的女人和孩子，就很愤怒，特别是对那些青年男子，因为他们觉得这些人很可以到前线去。而朝鲜人看到美国运输车队开过他们身边的时候，眼中毫无表情，因为在他们看来，所有这一切不过是把他们赶出自己的稻田的因素的一部分罢了。”
    瓦克的命令并未能阻止美军的继续败退。据美联社东京三十日电称：在瓦克发布命令的同日，美军又自黄涧（永同东北）撤退。
