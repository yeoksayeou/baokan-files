Xinhua News Agency: Beijing. The Ministry of Education and the General Administration of Press and Publication of the Central People's Government jointly issued the "Decision on Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools in the Autumn of 1950" to the education departments of major administrative regions, cultural and educational bureaus/education bureaus of provinces and cities, press and publication bureaus of major administrative regions, press and publication offices of provinces and cities, the general management office of Xinhua Bookstore, and its branches on July 5. The full text is as follows:

Considering the chaotic supply of primary and secondary school textbooks this spring, and the inconsistent versions used in various regions. Therefore, our Ministry and the General Administration have jointly drafted a list of textbooks for primary and secondary schools for the autumn of 1950, which will be distributed to the education departments of major administrative regions' military and political committees for reference and adoption. The regulations are as follows:

I. If the education departments of major administrative regions' military and political committees believe that the books listed for primary schools are not suitable for the specific conditions of their regions, they may choose other textbooks outside the list at their discretion. However, once these books are decided upon, they should be reported to our Ministry and the General Administration for record and promptly notify local educational administrative organs within the region to adopt them uniformly.

II. Regarding the books listed for secondary schools, except for the Northeast, it is hoped that the education departments of major administrative regions' military and political committees will select from the books listed according to the specific conditions of their regions (except for arithmetic, mathematics textbooks may freely select textbooks outside the list). After selection, please report to our Ministry and the General Administration for record and notify local educational administrative organs within the region to adopt them uniformly. If the education departments of major administrative regions' military and political committees believe it is necessary to select textbooks outside the list, they should first report to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government for approval.

After receiving the above-mentioned list of books, the education departments of major administrative regions' military and political committees should immediately convene a meeting with the heads of the military and political committees' press and publication bureaus, the heads of local Xinhua Bookstore branches, the United Publishing House or textbook supply agency, and relevant departments to decide on the textbooks for primary and secondary schools in the region. The education departments of major administrative regions' military and political committees should also assist the Xinhua Bookstore branches, the United Publishing House, or textbook supply agency in determining the required quantity of textbooks for primary and secondary schools in the region. After the meeting, please report the results of the discussion to our Ministry and the General Administration for record.

After determining the textbooks to be adopted, major administrative regions must notify various regions to collect and reflect, in an organized manner, opinions on the content of the adopted textbooks in teaching, and report to our Ministry and the General Administration at any time. (Note: A copy of the "List of Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools in the Autumn of 1950" has been sent separately to the education departments of major administrative regions.)

    查今年春季中小学教科用书，供应情形，甚为紊乱，各地采用的版本，亦不一律。为此，特由本部、署会同拟定一九五○年秋季中小学教科用书表，分发各大行政区军政委员会教育部参考采用。并规定办法如左：
    一、表内小学部分用书，各大行政区军政委员会教育部如认为不合于本区具体情况者，可在表外斟酌另行选用课本，但此项用书决定后，应即呈报本部、署备案，并迅速通知本区内各地教育行政机关统一采用。
    二、表内中学部分用书，除东北外，希望各大行政区军政委员会教育部按照本区具体情况就表内所列各书选用（数学教科书除算术外，可自由选用表外课本）。选定后希即呈报本部、署备查，并通知本区内各地教育行政机关统一采用。如各大行政区军政委员会认为必须在表外选用课本时，应先报请中央人民政府教育部核准。
    各大行政区军政委员会教育部收到上开用书表后，应即召集军政委员会新闻出版局、当地新华书店总分店负责人、联合出版社或教科用书供应机构负责人以及有关部门，开会决定本区中小学教科用书，各大行政区军政委员会教育部并应协助新华书店总分店、联合出版社或教科用书供应机构，决定本区内各地中小学教科用书需要数量。会后希将商讨结果，报告本部、署备查。
    各大行政区在确定采用课本后，必须通知各地对采用课本的内容在教学上发生的意见，要有组织地搜集反映，并随时报告本部、署。（按：一九五○年秋季中小学教科用书表一份已另发各大行政区教育部）
