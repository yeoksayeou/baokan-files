　　The Evil Consequences of Bureaucratic Leadership
    A Major Embezzlement Case Occurs at the Intestine Casing Factory Under the Northwest District Company of the China Animal By-Products Company
    To the Editor:
    On August 15th, the Xi'an *Masses Daily* published on its front page a report about the organized and planned embezzlement of over 88 million yuan in public funds by several illegal employees of the Intestine Casing Factory under the Northwest District Company of the China Animal By-Products Company. The main reason for this embezzlement incident was the factory leadership's serious bureaucratic style of work and complacency. Now that the whole country is carrying out rectification, I am specifically informing you of the contents of this report, requesting its publication in the newspaper to raise everyone's vigilance and avoid further losses of state property.

    The Intestine Casing Factory was established in the autumn of last year; the main factory is in Xi'an, with branches in Lanzhou, Dihua, Pingliang, and other places. In May of this year, the Public Security Department, the Supervisory Committee, and the Northwest Branch of the Procuratorate of the Northwest Military and Political Committee successively discovered that four employees of the factory—Ma Zhongyuan (accountant of the main factory), Ren Jinbu (accountant and reviewer of the main factory), Li Cheng森 (cashier of the main factory), and Ma Fay炎 (accountant of the Pingliang branch)—were colluding with each other, taking advantage of their positions to conduct large-scale embezzlement. According to the investigation: In February of this year, Ma Zhongyuan fabricated a salt purchase voucher, embezzling 10 million yuan, which he split with Ren Jinbu. In March, the Baoji branch received 15 million yuan from the main factory and issued a receipt; after using 5 million yuan, the remaining 10 million yuan was transferred to the Tianshui branch; after the Tianshui branch received the funds, they issued a receipt to the main factory, and Ma Zhongyuan made a duplicate claim, embezzling another 10 million yuan, which he again split with Ren Jinbu. In addition, they embezzled tens of millions more through fabricating expense claims and pocketing surplus from food expenses, which they shared with Ren and Li. Ma Fayan arrived at the Pingliang branch on May 1st, and on the 3rd, he used 40 million yuan of public funds to ask someone in Xi'an and Shanghai to purchase gold. On the 14th, he transferred the money back, sending 30 million yuan to the main factory; he deposited the remaining 10 million yuan in a private bank to collect interest or spent it himself; in addition, there were situations of reporting private expenses as public ones and underreporting income. The total amount embezzled by the four individuals reached a staggering 88,812,000 yuan. This is a major loss of state property!

    Why could such an organized and planned large-scale embezzlement incident exist in the Intestine Casing Factory for so long? The main reason is the factory leadership's serious bureaucratic ideology and work style.

    First, the factory was extremely unserious and imprudent in its appointment of personnel. Apart from a few cadres; most of the employees were appointed based solely on personal connections without any investigation. For example, Li Cheng森 was introduced by Ren Jinbu, and later Li introduced two of his younger brothers to work at the factory. The situation with Ma Zhongyuan was similar. Among these people, some had no concept of serving the people and were full of corrupt and degenerate thoughts. For example, when Ma Fayan went to the Pingliang branch, Ren Jinbu said, "Once you go outside, you'll have ways to make money. Just make it look passable on the surface; being a little careless doesn't matter, anyway, the accounts are in our hands."

    Second, the factory lacked both strict discipline in daily life and strict work systems. The leadership was unfamiliar with the business and did not study it, so they allowed people to do as they pleased. The factory's official seal and the factory director's personal seal were often kept by the accountant and cashier, and the leadership never checked the accounts. Last year, comrades Zhang Yulong and others from the Accounting Section of the Animal By-Products Company were sent to check the accounts and discovered many instances of discrepancies between the cash balance and the inventory, private loans, expense vouchers not being approved by the factory director but being privately entered into the accounts, and payments being made without vouchers or with vouchers but without original documents. They submitted a written report to the factory and proposed improvements. However, the factory leadership did not take heed and remained blindly trusting of the accountant and cashier. Usually, no one cared about these people's extravagant lifestyle. The former accountant, Li Jiao 吉, smoked opium, but the factory did not educate him; later, he stole money and ran away, but the factory did not investigate. All these situations contributed to these individuals' illegal activities.

    Third, the leading cadres of the factory also had hedonistic and corrupt ideas. For example, on one occasion, they bought more than twenty cartons of White Pagoda cigarettes, and they often played cards in the factory. Li Cheng森 wrote in his self-criticism, "The influence of the facts dragged me onto a path of great sin. In fact, my first impression was that the leading comrades lived lavishly, unlike other revolutionary comrades who struggled hard...." This is evident.

    Now, although the four criminals, Ma Zhongyuan, etc., have been handed over to the court for custody and handling, the serious bureaucratic style of work and corrupt ideas of the factory leadership must also be subjected to severe criticism and appropriate punishment. The numerous transactions between the factory's seven branches, thirty-two sub-branches, and the main factory must also be thoroughly investigated to completely eliminate the problem of unclear accounts.

### 官僚主义领导的恶果  中国皮毛公司西北区公司所属  肠衣厂发生重大贪污案

　　官僚主义领导的恶果
    中国皮毛公司西北区公司所属
    肠衣厂发生重大贪污案编辑同志：
    八月十五日西安《群众日报》一版上，发表了中国皮毛公司西北区公司所属肠衣厂几个不法职员，有组织、有计划地贪污公款八千八百余万的消息。这个贪污事件发生的主要原因，是该厂领导上的严重的官僚主义和麻痹思想。在现在全国进行整风的时候，我特把这个消息的内容告诉你们，请在报上公布，以引起大家警惕，避免使国家财产遭受损失。
    该肠衣厂是在去年秋天成立的；总厂在西安；兰州、迪化、平凉等地设有分厂。今年五月，西北军政委员会公安部、监察委员会和西北检察分署先后发现该厂职员马仲渊（总厂会计）、任进步（总厂会计兼复核）、李成森（总厂出纳）、马法炎（平凉分厂会计）等四人，利用职权，彼此勾结，进行大规模的贪污。据调查结果：今年二月间马仲渊假造购盐凭据一纸，贪污了一千万元，与任进步平分了。三月，宝鸡分厂向总厂领款一千五百万，开了收据；后实用五百万，其余一千万转汇天水分厂；天水分厂收到款后又给总厂开来收据，马仲渊又重支一笔账，贪污了一千万又与任平分。此外，又用假造支据、私吞伙食结余等方式贪污数千万与任、李分用。马法炎五月一日到平凉分厂，三日即动用公款四千万托人在西安、上海购买黄金。十四日又调回此款，汇总厂三千万；余下一千万私存银行取息或自己花了；此外还有私账报公，以少报多等贪污情形。总计四人贪污款额，竟达八千八百十二万元。这是国家财产的一个重大损失！
    为什么这种有组织有计划的大规模贪污事件，能够在肠衣厂长期存在呢？其主要原因是该厂领导上存在着严重的官僚主义的思想作风。
    首先，该厂在任用人员方面，极不严肃慎重。除了少数干部以外；其余人员大部是未加考查，仅以私人关系任用的。如李成森是任进步介绍来的，后来李又介绍他两个弟弟来厂工作。马仲渊情形也是如此。这些人中，有一部分根本没有为人民服务的观念，满脑子贪污腐化思想。如马法炎去平凉分厂时，任进步说：“你到外边去就有了办法，表面上只要过得去就行了，马虎一点也没关系，反正账都在我们手里。”
    其次，该厂既没严格的生活纪律，又无严格的工作制度。领导上对业务不熟悉，也不研究，就任人所为。厂中公章及厂长私章常存在会计出纳手中，领导上对账目从不检查。去年皮毛公司会计课曾派张玉龙等同志去查账，发现现金余额与库存不符，私人借款，开支单据不经厂长而私自作账及付款不经传票或有传票而无原始单据等情形很多，已给该厂作了书面报告，并提出改进意见。但该厂领导并未引起警惕，仍盲目信任会计出纳。平时这些人生活浪费，也无人过问。前会计李徼吉吸食毒品，该厂也不加教育；后来窃款逃跑，该厂也不追查。这些情况都助长了这些人的违法行为。
    第三、该厂领导干部也有享乐腐化思想，如有一次即买了白炮台香烟二十多筒，并常在厂内打牌。李成森的反省书里说：“事实的薰染，把自己牵到重重罪恶的道路上。事实上，第一个印象就是领导同志们的生活阔绰，不像其他革命同志的艰苦奋斗………。”由此可见一般。
    现在马仲渊等四犯虽已交送法院管押处理，但该厂领导上的严重官僚主义及腐化思想，也必须受到严正的批判和适当的处分。该厂七个分厂和三十二个支厂和总厂往来账目很多，也必须作一清查，以彻底改进账目不清的弊端。
