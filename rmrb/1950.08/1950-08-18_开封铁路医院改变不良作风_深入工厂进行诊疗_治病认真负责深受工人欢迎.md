　　Kaifeng Railway Hospital Changes Bad Practices
　　Goes Deep into Factories for Diagnosis and Treatment
　　Earnest and Responsible Treatment Welcomed by Workers
　　[Report from this Newspaper] Henan Daily News: The Kaifeng Railway Hospital has changed its work style and is going into factories to diagnose and treat the diseases of railway workers, which is deeply welcomed by the workers. In the past, this hospital had a very serious bureaucratic style, and the treatment of employees' illnesses was not serious. For example, regardless of the patient's condition, they had to sit outside and wait for their turn for a consultation. Doctors and nurses sat in the consulting room chatting and laughing, and when patients asked them questions, they were often treated indifferently. The diagnosis and treatment were also unsatisfactory to the employees, lacking patient examination, and were often simply asking a few questions, or applying some red potion and that was it. Therefore, the employees often said: "Going to our railway hospital for treatment is a waste of time, and often a small illness will turn into a big one."
　　According to employee feedback, the railway bureau leadership strengthened its leadership over the hospital; the hospital itself also took the initiative to conduct a self-criticism and formulated measures to improve medical work. In order to facilitate employee diagnosis, the hospital shifted its Sunday holiday to Monday, and continued to provide consultation on Sundays; it also provided consultation to employees during the daily lunch break, and the hospital staff's rest was postponed. The doctors' work attitude has also changed. For example, when the child of Li Shubin, a model driver of the locomotive, No. 716, became seriously ill, the hospital sent Dr. Li Guilin to treat him. Dr. Li stayed with the sick child all night without sleeping, and gave the child injections on time. Recently, the hospital also organized a "mobile medical team," and the responsible comrade of the hospital's trade union personally participated, going to the locomotive section and the East Repair Plant every other day to conduct diagnosis and treatment, and collect employees' opinions, which was deeply welcomed by the employees. In the past, workers were reluctant to ask for leave even when they were sick because they were actively working, but now with the "mobile medical team," they can get timely treatment when they are sick. The health of the workers is guaranteed, which greatly improves the workers' production morale.

　　开封铁路医院改变不良作风
    深入工厂进行诊疗
    治病认真负责深受工人欢迎
    【本报讯】河南日报消息：开封铁路医院改变作风，深入工厂诊疗铁路职工疾病，深受职工欢迎。该院以往官僚习气很重，对职工疾病治疗工作也不认真。如门诊时不管病人情况如何，都得坐在外边等候。医师护士坐在诊疗室谈天说笑，病人向他们问话，往往都是带理不理。诊断治疗也使员工不满意，缺乏耐心检验，往往是简简单单问一下，或抹些红药水就完事。因之，职工们经常说：“去咱铁道医院看病，去一趟看不好，往往小病会看成大病。”
    根据职工反映，路局领导上加强了对医院的领导；医院本身也主动地进行了检讨，订出了改善医疗工作的办法。为了便利员工诊病，医院将星期日的休假移到星期一，星期天照常诊病；每日中午休息时间也给职工诊病，医院人员的休息则向后移。医生的工作态度也改变了。如机车模范预备队员七一六号司机李树禀的小孩病重，医院派大夫李桂林去诊治。李大夫守着病孩通夜不睡，按时为小孩注射。最近该院又组织了“巡回医疗队”，该院工会负责同志亲自参加，隔日分赴机务段、东修配厂去进行诊疗，并收集职工的意见，深受职工欢迎。过去工友同志因为积极工作，有病也不愿请假，现在有了“巡回医疗队”，有病即可及时治疗。工友健康获得保证，更大大的提高了工人的生产情绪。
