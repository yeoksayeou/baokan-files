　　Learning Documents Combined with Checking Actual Work
    Wanping Rectification Study Initially Achieves Results
    Down to the Countryside Inspection Reveals Serious Disaster Situation
    [This newspaper dispatch] Wanping County Party Secretary Jing Zhenyang and Propaganda Minister Zhang Wenmao reported: In the rectification movement, Wanping County’s directly affiliated organizations adopted the method of combining studying documents with going down to the countryside to inspect actual work, achieving good results. Document study in the directly affiliated organizations began on July 5th, first studying the issue of the mass line. On July 10th, the County organized work teams to go to various districts to inspect work in the field. After the work teams went down to the countryside, they investigated the lives of the masses and various work situations door-to-door. After ten days of inspection, it was discovered that there was a serious bureaucratic work style of reporting good news but not bad in the leadership work of production to overcome the famine. At the county-wide enlarged cadre meeting on June 25th this year, various districts reported that except for the first district, the crops in all districts were very good; all districts had completed the second weeding; in terms of the lives of the masses, after the distribution of relief grain, there were no major problems. When various districts were making plans, they all said: We are confident that we can weed one more time. After inspection, it was found that the reports were completely inconsistent with the actual situation: Regarding the second weeding, the fourth district reported that it had been completed, but in reality, most of it had not even started. In Qiulinpu Village, only ten mu of land had been weeded twice by July 16th, and seventy-nine mu of the first weeding had been abandoned. For example, in the three villages of Shijiaying, Huang’antu, and Qiulinpu, a total of 354 mu of the first weeding had been abandoned. In terms of the disaster situation, after the work team went to the three villages of Qiulinpu, Shijiaying, and Huang’antu for in-depth investigation and statistics, it was found that the situation was still quite serious. Among the 492 households and 1,960 people in the three villages, only one household truly lived by eating grain; 65 households and 271 people mainly ate grain supplemented by vegetables; 143 households and 588 people maintained their lives with half grain and half vegetables; 216 households and 865 people mainly relied on eating vegetables (each person eating less than four liang of rice per day); 67 households (mostly without labor) and 235 people relied on eating vegetables all day long. According to incomplete statistics, 157 people in the three villages had already turned yellow and pale, and 37 people had developed edema. There were 88 such villages in the county, with 26,264 people. Among them, the disaster situation in 55 villages was slightly lighter. This inspection also found that more than 60,000 mu of millet in the county had been completely affected by the disaster (mostly eaten by stem borers and white hair disease, partly damaged by excessive rain), of which 15,000 mu could only have 20% of the normal yield, 20,000 mu could have 30% of the normal yield, and the best millet did not exceed 50%. The most severe situation was more than 10,000 mu, where even the seeds could not be recovered (now preparing to replant buckwheat). The above disasters had occurred in June, but none of the county and district cadres who went down to the countryside or lived in the organs discovered them, and even if individuals discovered them, they did not organize the masses to remove and treat them in time.
    The inspection also revealed that the most difficulties were in the remote villages on the edges of some counties and districts, while the county and district cadres did not go there for a year or half a year.
    The reason for these phenomena is mainly that the cadres lack the viewpoint of serving the people wholeheartedly. Some cadres put their work in a secondary position and spend all day circling around personal issues. Some people go home without even asking for leave, and stay away for a month or twenty days at a time. The county leaders’ rewards and punishments are not strict, which further encourages the cadres’ liberalistic work style. In their work, many cadres do not know how to combine departmental work with the central work, and often put the two in opposition to each other, paying attention to one and losing sight of the other. For example, when planting trees in the summer, the cadres go down to the countryside only to force the masses to plant trees; they do not care when they see the masses starving. Based on the above situation, the Wanping County Party Committee and cadres of various departments and party organizations at all levels, on July 25th, once again linked up to study documents, made in-depth self-criticism, and determined the future work direction.
    (Editor's note: The Wanping County Party Committee's report provides useful experience on how to combine document study with work inspection at this stage of study. The result of doing so is that the rectification study is closely integrated with the inspection of actual work from the beginning, and can expose the main problems in the work pertinently. After initially mastering the weapon of the mass line, the Wanping County Party Committee and its directly affiliated organizations discovered such serious problems related to the lives of the broad masses of people after ten days of inspection. It should be affirmed that this achievement is great. On the contrary, if the county's study had not adopted this method of combining it with work inspection, these serious problems would not have been discovered immediately; and if these problems were discovered half a month later, it would seriously threaten the lives of the masses, and even the lives of some of the masses, then the rectification movement would lose its practical significance. Therefore, Wanping County's method of combining document study with current work tasks is worth referring to by rectification studies in various places.)

　　学习文件结合检查实际工作
    宛平整风学习初获成效
    下乡检查发现灾情相当严重
    【本报讯】宛平县委书记景振洋、宣传部长张文茂报道：河北宛平县直属机关在整风运动中，采取学习文件与下乡检查实际工作相结合的办法，获得良好效果。直属机关各单位的文件学习于七月五日开始，首先学习群众路线问题。学习至七月十日，即组织县工作组，分赴各区实地检查工作。工作组下乡后，挨门逐户的调查群众生活和各种工作情况。经过十天检查，发现了生产度荒的领导工作中存在着严重的报喜不报忧的官僚主义作风。在今年六月二十五日的全县扩大干部会议上，各区汇报说：除一区外各区庄稼都很好；各区都已锄完二遍；在群众生活方面，经过发放救济粮后，已无多大问题。各区订计划时都说：我们有信心多锄一遍。经检查后，发现汇报与实际情况根本不符：就锄二遍说，四区汇报说已锄完，实际上大部还未动手，秋林铺村到七月十六日锄二遍的只有十亩地，并且还荒了七十九亩头遍。如史家营、黄安坨、秋林铺三个村，荒了头遍的共三百五十四亩。灾情方面，经工作组去秋林铺、史家营、黄安坨三个村，深入调查统计，发现情况还相当严重。三个村四百九十二户，一千九百六十个人中，真正以吃粮食过活的仅有一户；以吃粮为主吃菜为辅的，六十五户、人口二百七十一人；半粮半菜维持生活的，一百四十三户、五百八十八人；依吃菜为主（每人一天吃不到四两米）的，有二百一十六户、八百六十五人；整天靠吃菜度日的，有六十七户（大部无劳力）、二百三十五人。据不完全统计，三个村已有一百五十七个人面黄改色，并有三十七人发生浮肿。像这样的村子，全县有八十八个，两万六千二百六十四人。其中有五十五个村灾情略轻。这次检查中还发现全县有六万多亩谷子全部受了灾害（大部是钻心虫吃和白法病，部分因雨多涝坏），其中有一万五千亩只能有二成年景，有两万亩有三成年成，其他最好的谷子也超不过五成，最厉害的有一万多亩，连种籽也不能收回（现正准备重种荞麦）。以上灾害本来在六月就已发生，但所有县区下乡的或住机关的干部均未发现，个别人发现了也未组织群众及时除治。
    在检查中并发现一些县区边缘地区的偏僻村庄，工作中困难最多，而县区干部竟一年或半年不去。
    造成这些现象的原因，主要是干部缺乏全心全意为人民服务的观点。有些干部把工作放在次要地位，整天在个人问题上打圈子。有的人回家连假也不请，一回就是一月、二十天。县领导干部又奖惩不严，更助长干部的自由主义作风。在工作中，好多干部不会把部门工作和中心工作结合，常常把二者对立起来，顾此失彼。如夏季造林时，干部下乡只管硬叫群众种树；看到群众挨饿也不关心。根据以上情况，宛平县委和各部门、各级党组织干部，于七月二十五日再次联系学习文件，作深入检讨，并确定今后工作方向。
    （编者按：学习文件阶段怎样结合检查工作，宛平县委这篇报道提供了一个有益的经验，这样做的结果，使整风学习一开始就和检查实际工作紧密结合起来，能够切中要害地揭发出工作中的主要问题。宛平县委及直属机关在初步掌握了群众路线的武器后，下乡检查十天就发现了这样关系广大群众生活的严重问题。应该肯定地说，这个成绩是大的。相反地，假如该县学习不是采取这种与检查工作相结合的办法，这些严重的问题是不会立刻被发现的；而这些问题若迟至一月半月后才被发现的话，必将使群众生活，甚至部分群众的生命受到严重威胁，那么，整风运动就会失去了现实意义。因此，宛平县的这种学习文件与当前工作任务相结合的方法，是值得各地整风学习时参考的。）
