Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 26th: The Security Council met on August 25th, under the chairmanship of Soviet representative Malik, to continue discussions on the Korean issue.

After reading the French translations of the speeches made by Malik, Jebb, and Austin at the previous Security Council meeting, Malik rose to speak in his capacity as the Soviet representative, and presented materials refuting the false statements made by British representative Jebb and American representative Austin at the August 22nd meeting.

Malik first stated that all the facts he presented in his speech on August 22nd were based on official materials, and that every sentence he spoke about American support for the Rhee Syngman clique's aggressive actions had not been proven incorrect. Jebb and Austin did not base their arguments on these facts, but instead slandered the Soviet Union and compared it to Hitler. However, any claims of "lies" and "monstrous lies" could not refute the facts presented by the Soviet representative.

Malik reiterated that the United States began its aggression against Korea before any decision was made by the United Nations, and only then sought such a decision to cover up the American aggression. Austin himself told the Security Council on August 10th that the United States had ordered the U.S. Air Force to assist the Rhee Syngman regime as early as June 27th, even before the Security Council had made any decision. The illegal resolution of the Security Council on June 25th did not authorize any sanctions or military action in Korea, and the United States' order to the Air Force on June 27th also occurred several hours before the Security Council passed the illegal resolution of June 27th. Therefore, the United States sought to obtain the Security Council's resolution of June 27th to cover up the aggression it had already committed. Malik then accused Jebb of crudely distorting the quotations from the works of Lenin and Stalin. Jebb mistakenly quoted Volume II of the "History of Diplomacy," while he should have quoted Volume III, which contains passages describing the diplomatic tactics of the bourgeoisie, how it attempts to "localize" conflicts to cover up its activities, and how it engages in terrorist tactics. Malik emphasized that all these bourgeois diplomatic methods could be seen here in the Security Council. Soviet diplomacy has a completely different foundation from bourgeois diplomacy; it fights for world peace and helps humanity against aggressors.

Malik emphasized that not a single word quoted by Jebb was related to the Korean issue. Jebb talked about the period when Churchill, like Truman now attempting to organize armed intervention in Korea, organized armed intervention against Soviet Russia. Malik said that during Churchill's intervention, "civilized" criminals climbed into our country - the British and Americans in Murmansk, the Japanese and Americans in the Far East. They went there to enslave the Russian people. Fierce struggles ensued. At that time, Lenin and Stalin declared that the socialist motherland was in danger. Stalin said that the country must either build a truly well-trained army or be defeated. After the interventionists were driven out, Lenin put forward the doctrine of peaceful coexistence between the two systems, and Stalin further developed the doctrine in 1934, declaring that anyone who wanted peace would always find peace with the Soviet Union.

Malik further pointed out that Jebb's method of quoting out of context was exactly the same as the method used by Bevin and Shawcross to slander Soviet policies and the people. Historical experience shows that the Soviet Union has never tried to eliminate Britain and the United States by armed aggression, while Britain and the United States have tried to eliminate the Soviet Union. Malik then informed the member states, in his capacity as Chairman of the Security Council, that the United Nations Headquarters receives a large number of letters and telegrams every day protesting the U.S. Air Force and Navy's use of barbaric collective slaughter methods, bombing Korean cities and towns and shelling coastal areas. Malik said that such protests have been received from the governments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, China, Mongolia, and other countries. In addition, more than 3,500 letters and telegrams have been received from various women's and youth organizations, scientific workers' organizations, etc. Malik specifically mentioned letters and telegrams from the World Federation of Trade Unions, which unites 80 million trade union members, the Soviet trade unions, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which unites 70 million young men and women, and the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, which has collected hundreds of millions of signatures for the Stockholm Appeal. Malik pointed out that all these letters and telegrams prove that the masses of people all over the world demand peace and a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. He emphasized that every member of the Security Council can read the letters and telegrams sent by various organizations and many individuals received by the Secretariat. As for the protests from various governments, they have been classified as official documents.

Malik then said that after the Security Council meeting began, he received a document from the People's Government of China accusing the United States of aggression against Taiwan, and a statement from the American representative attempting to defend the United States' actions in Taiwan. Malik said that there is no doubt that the member states of the Security Council would be willing to read and study these documents and discuss them at future meetings.

U.S. Representative Gross spoke next. He said that given that the Security Council has received statements from the People's Government of China and the U.S. representative regarding Taiwan, he would like to read the U.S. statement so that it could be recorded in the minutes of today's meeting. Gross then read the U.S. statement.

When Gross finished reading the American document, Malik asked Assistant Secretary-General Sinchinko to read Zhou Enlai's statement. After Sinchinko finished reading, Malik said that the Security Council has now heard the views of both sides of an extremely serious international dispute. Malik then asked if the Security Council would like to adjourn immediately or at least hear one more person speak.

After a brief speech by Kuomintang member Chiang Ting-fu, the Security Council meeting adjourned. The Security Council had previously agreed to discuss the draft report of the Security Council's activities over the past year at the closing meeting on August 28.

　　安理会继续讨论朝鲜问题
    马立克以事实驳斥英美代表虚妄言论
    会上宣读了周外长关于台湾的声明
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十六日讯：安全理事会于八月二十五日在苏联代表马立克主持下开会，继续讨论朝鲜问题。
    在宣读了马立克、杰伯和奥斯汀在安理会前次会议上发表的演说的法文译文后，马立克以苏联代表资格起立发言，并提出材料驳斥英国代表杰伯和美国代表奥斯汀在八月二十二日会议上发表的虚妄言论。
    马立克首先宣称，他在八月二十二日的演说中所提出的一切事实都是以官方材料为根据的，他所说的关于美国支持李承晚集团的侵略行动的每一句话，都没有被证明是不对的。杰伯和奥斯汀不以这些事实为根据，却一味地毁谤苏联并以希特勒相比拟。但是任何关于“谎言”和“漫天大谎”的说法，都不能驳倒苏联代表提出的事实。
    马立克再度证明：美国在联合国没有采取任何决定之前就开始了对朝鲜的侵略，然后才寻找这种决定来掩饰美国的侵略。奥斯汀本人在八月十日就对安理会说，美国甚至在安全理事会未采取任何决定以前，就在六月二十七日命令美国空军予李承晚政权以援助。安全理事会六月二十五日的非法决议案也并没有授权在朝鲜采取任何制裁或军事行动，并且美国在六月二十七日给空军的命令也发生在安全理事会通过六月二十七日非法决议案之前数小时。因此，美国力求获得安理会六月二十七日的决议案来掩饰它已经进行的侵略。马立克继而指责杰伯粗暴地曲解从列宁及斯大林著作中所作的引证。杰伯错误地引用了“外交史”第二卷，而他原来是应该引用第三卷的，在第三卷中有若干段描写资产阶级的外交策略，和它如何试图使冲突“局部化”来掩饰它的活动，以及如何从事恐怖策略等。马立克着重指出，在此地安理会中，所有这些资产阶级外交方法都能看到。苏联外交与资产阶级外交有完全不同的基础，它为世界和平而奋斗，并帮助人类反对侵略者。
    马立克强调指出：杰伯所引用的话没有一句与朝鲜问题有关。杰伯谈到邱吉尔像杜鲁门现在企图组织朝鲜武装干涉那样，组织对苏俄的武装干涉的时期。马立克说，在邱吉尔干涉的时期，“文明的”罪犯爬到我国——英国人与美国人在摩尔曼斯克，日本人与美国人在远东。他们到那里奴役俄罗斯人民。激烈的斗争随之发生。那时列宁及斯大林宣布社会主义祖国在危险中。斯大林说，国家要么建立真正有训练的军队，要么就要被击败。在干涉者被逐出之后，列宁提出两个制度和平共存的学说，斯大林在一九三四年把该学说加以进一步发展，宣布任何要和平的人总会从苏联找到和平。
    马立克进一步指出：杰伯断章取义的方法，和以前贝文及肖克劳斯断章取义诽谤苏联政策与人民的方法完全一样。历史的经验说明：苏联从未试图用武装侵略消灭英国及美国，而英国及美国却曾试图消灭苏联。马立克于是以安理会主席身份通知各会员国：联合国总部每天收到大批函电，抗议美国空军和海军使用野蛮的集体屠杀办法，轰炸朝鲜城乡和炮击沿海地区。马立克说：已收到了波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、中国、蒙古等国政府的这种抗议。此外还收到了各种妇女和青年团体、科学工作者团体等三千五百多件的函电。马立克特别提到来自下列各处的函电：团结了八千万工会会员的世界工联、苏联工会，团结了七千万青年男女的世界民主青联，已经为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集了数亿签名的世界拥护和平大会常设委员会。马立克指出：所有这些函电都证明了全世界的人民大众要求和平与和平解决朝鲜问题。他强调称：安理会每一会员国都可以阅读秘书处所收到的各种团体和很多个人寄来的函电。至于各国政府的抗议，则已归入官方文件之列。
    马立克于是说：在安理会会议开始后，他收到中国人民政府控诉美国侵略台湾的文件和美国代表力图辩护美国对台湾之行动的声明。马立克说：毫无疑问，安理会的会员国会愿意阅读与研究这些文件，并在以后的会议上讨论它们。
    美国代表葛罗斯继起发言。他说：鉴于安理会已收到中国人民政府和美国代表关于台湾的声明，他愿意宣读美国的声明，以便将此声明记入今日的会议记录中。葛罗斯于是宣读了美国的声明。
    当葛罗斯读完美国文件时，马立克要求助理秘书长辛琴科宣读周恩来的声明。辛琴科读完后，马立克说：安理会现在已听到了一件极严重的国际纠纷的两方的意见，马立克当问安理会愿意立即休会，还是至少再听一个人的发言。
    在国民党人蒋廷黻的简短发言以后，安理会会议即告休会。安理会已预先协议在八月二十八日的闭幕会议上讨论安理会所提出的安理会会员国过去一年内的活动的报告草案。
