Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch: Speech by Mr. Li Zhouyuan, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China at the Beijing All Circles Celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day Demonstration Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea: Dear citizens of Beijing! Dear comrades!

　　The Korean people are now waging a just war against the aggression of the American imperialist bandits. In the name of the Korean people, I extend warm congratulations on your August 1st Army Day and pay the highest tribute to the brilliant history and great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation Army! The Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated 500 million Chinese people from long-term imperialist aggression and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has become a strong fortress for defending its own motherland and the people's regime and democratic construction; moreover, it has given tremendous inspiration and encouragement to the people of the entire Asian region who are holding high the banner of independence and self-determination and advancing!

　　The Chinese People's Liberation Army gives unlimited confidence to peace-loving people all over the world and receives unlimited respect from them; in order to defeat the warmongers and ensure lasting world peace, I pray for even greater victories in the future of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　The great Chinese people have already given the American imperialists a great lesson. They have taught them that invading others with dollars and force is bound to fail. But the ignorant and unrepentant American imperialists have boldly carried out aggression against Korea and Taiwan. The American imperialists vainly hoped to occupy North Korea within three days, and instigated the traitorous Syngman Rhee clique to launch a fratricidal civil war.

　　The heroic Korean People's Army's counterattack exposed their own miscalculations. They shamelessly shouted, "The Korean people are invading Korea," and personally took up weapons and directly embarked on the path of robbers.

　　The thieves used the banner of the United Nations, turning the United Nations into a mask to conceal their crimes, and ordered their vassal states, from as far away as Britain, Australia, and Canada, to frantically recruit cannon fodder for the aggressors.

　　However, the Korean people are no longer the slaves of yesterday's colonies. The Asian people have learned the way to fight for the unification and independence of their motherland. The power of the people mobilized to fight for the unification and independence of their motherland is great! The American imperialists did not realize that the Asian people have such great power!

　　On the Korean battlefield, the so-called defense line of the thieves, who boasted that they "will never retreat again," continues to collapse. The thieves are now trapped in a small corner of southeastern Korea, and the heroic Korean People's Army is advancing rapidly towards Busan and Jinhae.

　　With the warm support of peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean people are fighting heroically. The puppet government of Syngman Rhee and their so-called national defense army have been wiped out today.

　　If there were no American imperialism, our motherland would have been unified long ago, there would be no war in Korea, Americans would not have to shed blood in Korea, and the British, Canadians, etc. would not have to serve as cannon fodder. The Korean people have not infringed upon the interests of the American people. But the robbers insist that in order to have peace, they can massacre the Korean people and destroy Korean cultural facilities. What a shameless and upside-down theory this is! The thieves also say that if the United States occupies half of Korea, the world will have peace. What a shameless and upside-down theory this is!

　　The robbers use this upside-down theory to provoke wars in the world, attempting to salvage the serious contradictions that are occurring in their own country. But today, the Korean people, in order to no longer be slaves of others, are closely united around the Korean national hero, General Kim Il-sung, and are advancing towards victory with all their might for the front lines.

　　No matter how frantic the thieves become, they absolutely cannot save the dying Syngman Rhee. Victory must belong to the Korean people!

　　No matter how frantic the thieves become, they absolutely cannot save the dying Chiang Kai-shek who is in exile in Taiwan. Victory must belong to the Chinese people!

　　Long live the everlasting friendship and unity between the Korean and Chinese people!

　　Long live the victory of the world democratic and peace camp headed by the Soviet Union!

　　Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live the national hero of the Korean people, General Kim Il-sung!

　　Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the great Chinese people!

　　Long live Marshal Stalin, the mentor of peace-loving people of the world!

　　朝鲜共和国驻我国大使
    李周渊先生讲话
    【新华社一日讯】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国大使李周渊先生在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的讲话：亲爱的北京市民诸位！亲爱的诸位同志！
    朝鲜人民现在正对美帝强盗的侵略进行着正义的战争。我以朝鲜人民的名义，对贵国的八一建军节致以热烈的祝贺，并对于中国人民解放军的灿烂的历史和伟大的胜利致以最高的荣誉！中国人民解放军从长期的帝国主义的侵略和蒋介石的反动统治下解放了五万万的中国人民。中国人民解放军已经成为保卫自己的祖国和人民的政权与民主建设的坚强的城塞；不但如此，并且给予高举自主独立的旗帜而前进的全亚洲人民以巨大的激励和鼓舞！
    中国人民解放军给予爱好和平的全世界人民以无限的信心，并从他们那里受到无限的尊敬；为了打倒战争贩子，为了确保世界的持久和平，我祈望在中国人民解放军的前途更有伟大的胜利！
    伟大的中国人民已经给美帝国主义者以很大的教训。已经教训了他们：拿着美元和武力侵略别人是必遭失败的。可是愚昧不醒的美帝国主义者们，又大胆的实行了对朝鲜和台湾的侵略。美帝国主义者们妄想着三天以内就能占领北朝鲜，嗾使李承晚卖国匪帮发动了同族相争的内战。
    由于英勇朝鲜人民军的反攻暴露了他们自己的错误估计。他们就无耻地高喊着：“朝鲜人民侵略朝鲜”，并亲手拿着武器，直接进入强盗之途。
    贼徒们利用联合国的旗帜，变联合国为隐蔽自己罪恶的假面具，命令自己的附庸国们，远从英国，澳洲和加拿大等，疯狂地招募着侵略者的炮灰。
    可是，朝鲜人民已经不是昨天的殖民地的奴隶。亚洲人民已经学会了争取自己祖国的统一和独立的方法。为了争取自己祖国的统一和独立而动员起来的人民的力量是伟大的！美帝国主义者们没有估计到亚洲人民有这样伟大的力量！
    在朝鲜的战场上，贼徒们豪言“再不退却”的所谓防线继续在崩溃着。贼徒们现在被困在朝鲜东南地区的不大的一隅，而英勇的朝鲜人民军，正向釜山、镇海猛进中。
    在全世界爱好和平人民的热烈声援和支持下，朝鲜人民英勇的斗争着。李承晚的傀儡政府和他们的所谓国防军，今天，已经被消灭了。
    假设没有美帝国主义，我们祖国早已统一，朝鲜也不会有战争，美国人也用不着在朝鲜流血，英国人、加拿大人等也用不着充当炮灰。朝鲜人民没有侵犯过美国人的利益。可是强盗们硬说为了和平可以屠杀朝鲜人民，破坏朝鲜的文化设施。这是多么颠倒是非而无耻的理论呀！贼徒们又说：美国强占朝鲜的一半，世界才能和平，这又是多么颠倒而无耻的理论呢？
    强盗们用这种颠倒的理论，挑拨世界的战争，企图挽救发生在自己国内的严重的矛盾。可是今天朝鲜人民为了不再当人家的奴隶，巩固团结在朝鲜民族英雄金日成将军的周围，一切为了前线，猛向胜利前进。
    贼徒们不论怎样发狂，绝对救不了垂死的李承晚。胜利一定是属于朝鲜人民的！
    贼徒们不论怎样的发狂，绝对救不了流亡台湾的垂死的蒋介石。胜利一定是属于中国人民的！
    朝中人民的永久友好团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的世界民主和平阵营的胜利万岁！
    中国人民解放军朱德总司令万岁！
    朝鲜人民的民族英雄金日成将军万岁！
    伟大中国人民领袖毛泽东主席万岁！
    世界爱好和平人民的导师斯大林大元帅万岁！
