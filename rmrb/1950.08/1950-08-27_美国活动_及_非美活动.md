　　“American Activities” and “Un-American Activities”
　　by Le Xiding
　　The infamous House Un-American Activities Committee has issued a formal warning that it will persecute any American who signs the Stockholm Appeal calling for a ban on atomic weapons. The implication of this warning is that in America, to be a peace advocate is to engage in "un-American activities"; to hope for peaceful international cooperation is to engage in "un-American activities"; to fight against the dangers of inhumane atomic warfare is to engage in "un-American activities."
　　According to the authoritative interpretation of the Congressional "defenders of democracy," engaging in "American activities" means inciting national hatred, manufacturing large quantities of atomic weapons, violently threatening to use atomic weapons against freedom-loving nations, interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, and strangling democratic freedoms.
　　The first million Americans who signed the Stockholm Appeal have already caused panic and anger among the American rulers. They thought that by using Congress and the newspapers, radio, and movies controlled by monopolistic capitalists to attack peace advocates, they could prevent the American people from uniting with the universal desire of the world's people to ban inhumane atomic weapons. Washington is also placing great hope in imperialist war propaganda, which is coordinated with the aggression against the Korean people.
　　The development of events has overturned all their estimates. Although the Stockholm signature campaign was launched later, it is being carried out more and more widely among the American people. Statements issued by the American Peace Crusade and other democratic organizations emphasize that the flood of signatures has risen sharply since the attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
　　The repressive measures and terror tactics of the American reactionaries against peace advocates have begun, which is enough to prove the complete bankruptcy of all their "arguments" against the Stockholm Appeal. Where the clichés of bourgeois propaganda fail, they place their hopes on Congressional advisory committees and secret agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Signature collectors—workers, intellectuals, housewives—are arrested by the police on the streets and subjected to torture, fines, and imprisonment. On July 4th, American Independence Day, five men and four women collecting peace signatures were arrested in Philadelphia, the very place where the Declaration of Independence was signed.
　　Some of the pretexts used to carry out this persecution are completely unfounded. Peace advocates in California are charged with "disturbing the peace," peace advocates in Georgia are charged with "disorderly conduct," peace advocates in Alabama are charged with "vagrancy," and there are various other charges elsewhere, although the only "crime" of all these people is their noble desire to strive for lasting peace.
　　Facts prove that the American people reject the interpretation of "American" and "un-American" activities made by the committee composed of reactionary congressmen. The New York Labor Peace Committee receives many letters every day from people who have become vigilant under the threat of a third world war, and they are willing to do their best to collect peace signatures.
　　The American reactionaries are trying to obliterate the success of the Stockholm Appeal in the United States by using the claim of a Communist "conspiracy," so FBI Director Hoover said in his annual report that this is "the scope of their underground activities." Is there anyone who doesn't see through this utterly foolish police lie? The Stockholm Appeal signatures are being collected openly, and the content of the appeal has been widely disseminated. Not only Communists are sponsoring the signature campaign, but also tens of thousands of people who have little to do with Communism.
　　Among the first Americans to sign the Stockholm Appeal, we can find Oldham, the former bishop of the Protestant Church in Albany, New York; Reverend Bowman, secretary of the Michigan Council of Churches, and Reverend Giggan of Wyoming; Dr. Piller, professor of theology at the University of Miami, Florida; Professor Bielkmann of North Carolina; Chemayeff, architect of the Chicago Pattern Design Association; writer McDonald; poetess Comfortes; William, publisher of "Southern Farmer"; Quonstman, Eastern President of the National Farmers Union; Taichen, Executive Secretary of the National Maritime Cooks and Stewards Union; Stumm, Secretary of the Illinois Painters Union, and many other upright people who abhor the idea of another massacre.
　　In a declaration to Secretary of State Acheson, the New York Labor Peace Committee pointed out that Acheson's attacks on the peace movement and the Stockholm Appeal, coupled with his hints at the use of atomic bombs, can only incite more Americans to sign the appeal.
　　The declaration stated: "Mr. Acheson, the collective killing of the entire population is not something 'inconsequential.' Your efforts to suppress peace and the Stockholm Appeal will not achieve the effect you desire. People are continuing to sign, regardless of nationality, religion, occupation, or political belief."
　　All upright Americans thus understand what true American activity is. They have no illusions about the swindlers and robbers in the so-called congressional committees in the United States, which have good reason to be called "Un-American Committees."

### “美国活动”及“非美活动”

　　“美国活动”及“非美活动”
    勒·西丁作
    美国众议院中臭名远扬的非美活动委员会已经发出正式警告说：它将迫害凡在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的一切美国人。这一警告的含义是：在美国，作一个和平拥护者就是从事“非美活动”；希望国际间和平合作就是从事“非美活动”；对非人道的原子战争的危险作斗争就是从事“非美活动”。
    依照国会“民主制度守卫者们”的权威解释，从事“美国活动”就是煽动民族间的敌意，制造大批原子武器，横暴地威胁着要对爱好自由的国家使用原子武器，干涉别国的内政和绞杀民主自由。
    美国中在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的第一批百万人已经引起了美国统治者们的惊慌和愤怒。他们以为通过国会、通过独占资本家所控制的报纸、无线电和电影对和平拥护者的横加攻击，就可以阻止美国人民与要求禁止非人道的原子武器的世界各国人民的普遍愿望结合起来。华盛顿又把巨大的希望寄托于帝国主义的战争宣传，这是配合着对朝鲜人民的侵略的。
    事实的发展，推翻了它们的一切估计。斯德哥尔摩签名运动虽然发动得迟些，可是愈来愈广泛地在美国人民中间开展了。美国和平宣传站和别的民主组织所发表的声明上着重指出：在对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国发动进攻以后，签名运动的巨流高涨起来了。
    美国反动派对和平拥护者的镇压措施和恐怖手段已经开始，这正足以证明他们反对斯德哥尔摩宣言的所有“论据”的彻底破产。在资产阶级宣传的滥调失效的地方，他们又将希望寄托在国会咨询委员会和联邦调查局的秘密特务身上了。签名征集者们——工人、知识分子、家庭主妇——在街上被警察捕去，便遭受拷打、罚金和监禁。七月四日是美国独立纪念日，那一天，就在独立宣言签字所在地的费城，征集和平签名的五个男子和四个妇女被逮捕了。
    用以进行这种迫害的一些借口都是彻头彻尾没有理由的。加里福尼亚州的和平拥护者被控“妨碍和平”的罪名，和平拥护者在乔治亚州的罪名是“破坏秩序的行为”，在阿拉巴马州的罪名是“流浪”，在其他地方还有各种罪名，虽然这一切人们仅有的“罪过”就是他们争取持久和平的高贵愿望。
    事实证明：反动国会议员们所组成的那一委员会就“美国”和“非美”的活动所作的解释，美国人民是加以拒绝的。纽约劳工和平委员会每天从那些在第三次大战的威胁下警觉起来的人民那里收到许多来信，他们愿意为征集和平签名而尽力。
    美国反动派企图用共产党“阴谋”这一种说法来抹煞斯德哥尔摩宣言在美国的成功，所以联邦调查局局长胡佛在其常年报告中说，这是“他们地下活动的扩张范围”。难道还有谁不清楚这种十分愚蠢的警察谎言吗？斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名正在公开征集着，宣言的内容已经广泛地传播开去。赞助签名运动的不仅是共产党员，还有成千成万和共产主义远不相干的人们。
    在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的第一批美国人中间，我们可以找到纽约州阿尔巴尼的新教教会的前主教奥德汉；密执安州教会委员会秘书鲍曼牧师与怀俄明州的吉甘牧师；弗罗里达州迈安密大学神学教授皮勒博士；北卡罗里纳州的比尔克曼教授；芝加哥图样设计协会建筑师却玛耶夫；作家麦克唐纳；女诗人康佛尔丝；“南方农民”的出版者威廉姆；全国农民联盟东部主席宽司特曼；全国海上厨师和侍役联盟执行秘书泰琴；伊里诺斯州画家联盟秘书斯突姆，以及其他许多憎恶另一次大屠杀思想的正直的人民。
    纽约劳工和平委员会在给国务卿艾奇逊的宣言里指出，艾奇逊对和平运动和斯德哥尔摩宣言的攻击，同时加上他对使用原子弹的暗示，只能激起更多的美国人在宣言上签名。
    宣言中说道：“艾奇逊先生，关于对居民全体的集体杀害的事情，并不是什么“无关紧要的”。你压迫着和平及斯德哥尔摩宣言的一些努力是不会达到你们希求的效果的。人民正在继续签名，不分民族、宗教、职业或政治信仰的差别。”
    所有正直的美国人就这样地懂得了什么是真正的美国活动。他们对于有恰当理由可以称作“非美委员会”的在美国的所谓国会委员会中的骗子和强盗们是没有什么幻想的。
