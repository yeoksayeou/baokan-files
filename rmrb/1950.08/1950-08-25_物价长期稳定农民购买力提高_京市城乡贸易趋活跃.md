　　Long-Term Price Stability and Increased Purchasing Power of Farmers:
    Beijing's Urban-Rural Trade Becomes Active

[This newspaper report from Beijing News Agency]: Beijing's urban-rural trade is gradually becoming active. Because of long-term price stability, the increased purchasing power of farmers after the wheat harvest and fruit season, and the state-owned trading companies' proactive efforts to adjust products from various regions, urban-rural trade has not only increased in quantity and variety on the basis of existing trade relations, but also trade in distant regions, which had been separated for many years, has begun. According to the statistics of the Cotton Cloth Exchange, the number of cloth purchased by merchants from other places in Beijing was 7,661 bolts in April, 14,013 bolts in May, 16,317 bolts in June, and 14,820 bolts in July. More than 50% of these were sold to Chahar and Suiyuan provinces, and the rest were sold to various places in central and eastern Hebei province. According to the statistics of the Salt Branch Company, the amount of salt sold to other places in June was 15,864 dan (a unit of dry measure, about 50 kg), an increase of 119% compared with May, and the amount of salt sold to other places in July was 11,861 dan. The sales area has also expanded compared with the past. The direct sales area of ​​the branch company reached 29 cities, counties, and key towns. The foreign trade volume of the Department Store Branch Company increased significantly in June and July. Among the items sold to other places, matches were the most popular. 18,000 packages were sold in May, 617,000 packages were sold in June, and 500,400 packages were sold in July, of which 80% were sold to small and medium-sized cities in North China. Judging from the business of the cooperative warehouses (cooperative warehouses are bridges that assist cooperative societies in various counties and districts to establish trade relations with various public and private industrial and commercial enterprises in cities), the total value of goods sold on consignment in June was 5.8 billion yuan, an increase of 6% compared with May, and 4.6 billion yuan in July; the total value of goods purchased on consignment was 2.8 billion yuan in June, an increase of 22% compared with May, and 2 billion yuan in July. In June and July, the number of remote cooperative societies that had trade relations with the warehouse increased by more than a dozen. For example, Jilin tobacco leaves, Shandong silk, Songjiang Songhua eggs, Zhengzhou millet, Zhejiang umbrellas and fans, and southern Anhui raw silk were all transported to Beijing. (The reason why the trade volume in July generally decreased compared with June is that July is the busy farming season and the rainy season, and transportation is inconvenient. Most of the summer supplies for farmers were purchased after the wheat harvest, and autumn and winter supplies must be purchased after the autumn harvest. Therefore, every year is called a "slow month". However, the sales volume of various industries in July this year was not much worse than that in June, and it was still larger than that in May. This is because the purchasing power of farmers has increased after the land reform.)
The Native Produce Branch Company is adjusting the native products of various distant provinces. Most of the goods received are in urgent need of promotion due to long-term trade separation. For example, Zhejiang sleeping mats and sunflower fans, Northeast China lard, dried mushrooms and honey, Shandong fresh ginger, and Hunan gypsum, were quickly sold out after being transported to Beijing. The company also assisted the Beijing dried and fresh fruit industry to purchase fruits in Guangzhou, and promoted the vermicelli produced in Beijing to Guangzhou.

　　物价长期稳定农民购买力提高
    京市城乡贸易趋活跃
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：京市城乡贸易，已渐活跃。因为物价的长期稳定、麦收和瓜果上市后农民购买力提高及国营贸易公司主动调剂各地产品，所以城乡贸易不仅在旧有的贸易关系上增加了数量和种类，而且多年隔绝的远地，也开始了物资交流。据纱布交易所统计，外埠商贩在京购买布匹，四月份为七、六六一匹，五月份为一四、○一三匹，六月份为一六、三一七匹，七月份为一四、八二○匹。其中百分之五十以上销往察、绥，其他销冀中、冀东各地。据盐业分公司统计，六月份外销食盐为一五、八六四担，比五月份增加了百分之一一九，七月份外销食盐为一一、八六一担。销售地区也较前扩大，分公司直接销售地区即达二十九个市、县、要镇。百货分公司六、七月份对外地贸易额显著增加。外销物品中以火柴为最多，五月份销一八、○○○包，六月份销达六一七、○○○包，七月份销五○○、四○○包，其中百分之八十是销到华北各中小城市。从合作货栈的营业来看（合作货栈是协助各县区合作社在城市中与各公私营工商业发生贸易关系的桥梁），六月份代销货物总值是五十八亿元，比五月份增加百分之六，七月份是四十六亿元；代购货物总值六月份是二十八亿元，比五月份增加百分之二十二，七月份是二十亿元。在六、七月中和该栈发生贸易关系的远地合作社，比以前又增多十几个单位。如吉林烟叶，山东绸子、松江松花蛋，郑州小米，浙江雨伞、扇子，皖南生丝等都输来北京（七月份贸易额比六月份普遍下降的原因是，七月份正值农忙和多雨季节，交通不便，农民的夏季用品，在麦收后大部购齐，秋冬用品，须待秋收后购买。所以历年都称为“淡月”。但今年七月份各业销货量，并不比六月份差得很多，并且比五月份还大。这是土地改革后农民购买力提高了的缘故。）
    土产分公司调剂着远地各省的土产品。所收各货，大都是因长期贸易隔绝而迫切要求推销的。如浙江凉席、葵扇，东北猪油、元蘑、蜂蜜，山东鲜姜，湖南石膏等，运京之后，很快就销售一空。该公司又协助京市干鲜等业，到广州去采购水果，并将京市所产的粉丝推销到广州。
