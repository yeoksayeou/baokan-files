Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th - The new record creation movement in Northeast industrial and mining enterprises over the past six months has been steadily developing with closer integration with science and technology. Its main characteristic is that new records solely based on increasing labor intensity have relatively decreased, while new records based on improving technology and management methods have relatively increased. In the steelmaking branch of the Fushun Mining Bureau Steel Plant, in May and June alone, 23 new records were created for technological improvements and inventions, with a newly created value of approximately 3 billion Northeast currency. Zhang Dexin, a worker at the state-owned Jixi Coal Mine, created an automatic spraying vehicle that can completely spray coal dust in a 100-meter-long roadway in ten minutes, preventing coal dust explosions and greatly contributing to security work. The state-owned Jilin Shixian Paper Mill, which has repeatedly created various new records, reformed the production organization of the wood handling workshop in April, saving one-sixth of the labor compared to the past, and saving 1.5 billion yuan per month in electricity, materials, and mechanical transportation costs. According to statistics from thirteen factories and mines in Jilin Province, where the new record movement was not thoroughly carried out last year, a total of 766 new records were created in the first quarter of this year, including improvements in technology and equipment. Among them, employees of the Huadian Oil Shale Mine and Oil Refinery improved the oil pipes of the oil refining furnace, which not only extended the life of the oil refining furnace but also increased crude oil production by one-quarter compared to the past.

At present, the new record movement in Northeast China has been transformed into a regular mass movement in most factories and mines. In many factories and mines with more than 200 people, new record movement committees have been established under the leadership of the factory management committee to be specifically responsible for the promotion, review, reward, and publicity and mobilization of the movement; and in accordance with the spirit of the "Provisional Regulations on Rewarding the Creation of New Production Records" promulgated by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, various new records are summarized into four categories: creation and invention, technological improvement, rationalization proposals, and improvement of technical proficiency and labor enthusiasm, and rewards are given in a certain proportion based on the effect of increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs. However, the management personnel of many factories and mines have relaxed their leadership over the new record movement, affecting the further development of the movement. This is one of the main shortcomings in the current new record creation movement in Northeast China.

　　提高科学技术·改进管理方法
    东北新纪录运动稳步发展
    【新华社沈阳三十日电】半年来东北工矿企业的创造新纪录运动，是在与科学技术进一步结合的情况下稳步发展的。它的主要特点是单纯提高劳动强度的新纪录比较减少，改进技术和管理方法的新纪录相对增多。抚顺矿务局制钢厂炼钢分厂，五、六两月即出现了改进技术、发明创造的新纪录二十三件，新创造的价值约合东北币（下同）三十亿元。国营鸡西煤矿工人张德新，创造出一种自动喷雾车，可将一百公尺长的大巷内煤尘，在十分钟内全部喷完，避免了煤尘爆发，对保安工作贡献很大。曾屡创各种新纪录的国营吉林石岘造纸厂，四月份改革了调木车间的生产组织，较前节省人工六分之一，每月并节省电力、材料和机械运输消耗等费用十五亿元。去年新纪录运动开展不够深入的吉林省营工业，据十三个厂矿统计，今年第一季度共创造包括改进技术与装备的新纪录达七百六十六件。其中桦甸油母页岩矿制油厂职工，将炼油炉的油管改进以后，不仅延长了炼油炉的寿命，且使原油产量较前提高了四分之一。
    目前东北的新纪录运动，已在大部厂矿转入经常性的群众运动。在二百人以上的许多厂矿，都在工厂管理委员会领导之下，成立了新纪录运动委员会，专门负责运动的推行、审核、奖励和宣传鼓动等工作；并按东北人民政府工业部颁发的“关于创造生产新纪录奖励暂行条例”的精神，把各种各样的新纪录归纳为创造发明、技术改进、合理化建议和技术熟练与劳动热情的提高四类，根据对提高产量、质量和降低成本的效果，实行一定比例的奖励。但亦有不少厂矿的管理人员，放松了对新纪录运动的领导，影响运动的进一步开展。这是目前东北创造新纪录运动中的主要缺点之一。
