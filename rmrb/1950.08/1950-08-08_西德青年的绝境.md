The Plight of West German Youth

　　In West Germany, under the rule of American imperialists, the situation of young people is becoming increasingly desperate, a fact even "German News and Economic News," the organ of West German industrialists, is compelled to acknowledge. According to this newspaper, seven hundred thousand workers are unemployed in West Germany. The number of young people who have left school without the opportunity to find work may increase by another two hundred thousand by autumn.

　　西德青年的绝境
    在美国帝国主义者统治下的西德，青年们所处的境遇正逐渐地变得愈来愈绝望了，甚至连西德工业家们的机关刊物“德意志新闻与经济新闻”也不得不予以承认。根据这个报纸，在西德有七十万工人失业。业已离校而没有机会找到工作的青年的数目，到秋天又可能再增加二十万人。
