　　Good Daughter of the Party (Continued)
　　By Jiang Ping
　　(IV) The factory director announced to the workers that a comrade was to be transferred to work in the chemical compounding room, but everyone knew that the medicines were often dangerous. Everyone hesitated and dared not respond. At this time, Zhao Guilan raised her hand to accept the task.
　　(V) Zhao Guilan is now a glorious Communist Party member. She takes the lead in uniting the masses and helping others in both work and study. Once, while teaching someone how to grind medicine, a fire broke out. Everyone was scared and ran away, but she disregarded the danger and put out the fire with her hands, and her hands were burned with black blisters.
　　(VI) Zhao Guilan's body was originally very weak, but she never complained in her arduous work, and always completed the tasks assigned by the Party with selfless spirit. Once, glass shards hit her eyes, causing her to shed tears of pain. Even so, she persisted in her work with one eye for more than twenty days.
