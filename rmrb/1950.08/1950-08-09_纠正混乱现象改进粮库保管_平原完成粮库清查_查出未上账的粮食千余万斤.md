　　Xinhua News Agency, Xinxiang Telegram: The grain depot inventory work in Pingyuan Province concluded in early June. Through this inventory, the chaotic phenomenon of discrepancies between accounting records and grain stock figures has been corrected. This inventory improved grain storage management, and according to preliminary statistics, uncovered more than 12.53 million jin of grain that had not been accounted for in the past.

　　Prior to May of last year, Pingyuan Province was still in a war environment, and public grain was stored in a decentralized manner. Due to various reasons, the books did not match the inventory, and grain depots at all levels had not conducted thorough inspections. Therefore, the Provincial Grain Bureau had been unable to accurately ascertain the actual amount of grain in the province. During the statistics in December of last year, the figures of the Provincial Grain Bureau's Administrative Section and Accounting Section differed by tens of millions of jin. During this inventory, the actual situation of grain storage was clarified through tasks such as transferring warehouses, merging warehouses, weighing, and accounting. The accounting records and inventory figures have been brought into agreement.

　　Secondly, in the past, state treasury grain and local grain were mixed together throughout the province, and the phenomenon of local areas arbitrarily using state treasury grain was very common. This misappropriated state treasury grain amounted to more than 4.35 million jin. Among them, Dong'a County used 300,000 jin of state treasury grain, and Yuncheng County also misappropriated 400,000 jin after the wheat harvest last year. After this cleanup, all state treasury grain that had been used in the past has been returned to the state treasury. In instances where the state treasury had overdrawn local grain, the Provincial Grain Bureau has reported this to the Central Ministry of Finance for approval and return. Currently, state treasury grain and local grain are stored separately in all regions.

　　Furthermore, this inventory revealed that a large amount of grain, totaling more than 1.758 million jin, was lost due to mold, theft, and embezzlement. During this inventory process, grain storage systems were established and improved in response to the aforementioned serious situations. Various levels of grain protection committees composed of public security departments, local farmers, and militiamen have been established in various regions at the county, district, and village levels, and systems such as regular grain depot inspections, monthly reports, and requests for instructions are being implemented. Most regions have also stipulated a system of surprise grain depot inspections after rain in order to reduce the phenomenon of mold. At the same time, in order to concentrate storage and facilitate management, this inventory also implemented the transfer and consolidation of warehouses. The number of agency warehouses in the province has been reduced from more than 610 to 307, and as a result, the management personnel of the agency warehouses have been reduced by about half, saving a large amount of manpower and financial resources.

　　纠正混乱现象改进粮库保管
    平原完成粮库清查
    查出未上账的粮食千余万斤
    【本报讯】新华社新乡电：平原省各地粮库清查工作，已于六月初结束。通过这次清查，过去账目与库存粮食数字不符的混乱现象已被纠正。这次清查改进了粮食保管工作，并据初步统计，查出过去没有上账的粮食一千二百五十三万多斤。
    平原省在去年五月以前，还处在战争环境中，公粮分散保管，由于各种原因，账簿与库存不符，各级粮库也没有进行深入检查，因此，省粮局一直未能准确地掌握全省粮食实数。去年十二月统计时，省粮局行政科与会计科的数字相差竟达数千万斤。这次清查中，经过移仓、并仓、过秤和算账等工作，存粮的实际情况才得以弄清。账目和库存数字已达到一致。
    其次，过去全省国库粮和地方粮混合存放，各地擅自动用国库粮的现象很普遍。此项被动用的国库粮计达四百三十五万斤之多。其中东阿县就动用国库粮三十万斤，郓城县在去年麦收后也挪用了四十万斤。经这次清理后，凡过去动用国库粮的，已如数归还国库，部分国库长动支地方粮的，也已由省粮局呈报中央财政部核准归还。现各地国库粮与地方粮都已分开保管。
    再次，此次清查中，发现因霉烂、被盗、贪污而损耗的粮食很多，计达一百七十五万八千余斤。这次清查过程中，已针对上述严重情况建立和健全了粮食保管制度。各地先后建立了由公安部门和当地农民、民兵等组成的县、区、村各级护粮委员会，并开始执行定期检查粮库、月终汇报，请示报告等制度。大部地区还规定了雨后突击查库的制度，以期减少霉烂现象。同时，为了集中存储，便于保管，这次清查中还实行了移仓、并仓，现全省代理仓库已由六百一十余所减为三百零七所，因而代理仓库的管理人员已比过去减少一半左右，节省了大批人力、财力。
