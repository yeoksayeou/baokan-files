Editor's Note: Regarding the question of whether hail can be controlled and whether the use of local guns and cannons to bombard hail is effective, this newspaper published an article by Mr. Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, entitled "Can Human Power Overcome Hail?" on the third page of August 9th, and reprinted five sections from Chapter 7, "The Weather's Words," of the book "Man Conquers Nature" by Soviet author Ilin, to provide further explanation. Now, we publish the article "On the Prevention of Hail and Frost Damage" by the Meteorological Bureau of the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and the article "My Opinions on Hail Prevention" by Liu Shanben, and reprint a portion of Chapter 12, "Taming the Shrew," of the book "Man and Nature" by Soviet author Ilin, to further illustrate this issue.

The Beijing People's Daily published detailed reports on the hail disasters that occurred in the four provinces of Shanxi, Pingyuan, Hebei, and Henan on May 25th of this year on June 12th and 13th. From these reports, we know that the disaster areas were vast, and the disasters were quite serious. In many places, farmers had already organized hail prevention using local cannons, and many people believed it to be very effective, and it should be widely promoted, while also attracting the attention and discussion of people from all walks of life. We would like to discuss the following issues from a meteorological standpoint: (1) the causes of hail formation, and (2) the issue of using artillery fire to prevent hail.

(1) How is hail formed? Three conditions must be met for hail to form: ① strong updrafts; ② the air must contain abundant moisture; ③ the temperature at the top of the updraft must be lower than the freezing point. With strong updrafts, the moist air from the lower layers rises to high altitudes, where the air becomes cold, and the water vapor capacity decreases, causing condensation and forming thick cumulonimbus clouds. The upper part of the cloud is below the freezing point, and water vapor condenses into ice particles; the lower part is warmer, and it condenses into water droplets; between the two, there is a mixed layer of ice and water droplets. The resulting water droplets and ice particles are initially small, but later, because the updrafts are sometimes slow and sometimes rapid, the water droplets and ice particles repeatedly rise and fall, gradually merging into larger water droplets or ice particles. Larger ice particles fall to lower altitudes, and if they encounter strong updrafts, they can be carried to higher layers again, where moisture adheres and condenses along the way, and freezes again at a certain altitude. This rising and falling occurs several times, and the shape finally increases until the updraft cannot bear the weight, and it falls as hail. The stronger the updraft, the more significant the intermittent phenomenon, and the more times the ice block rises and falls, the larger it becomes. Ordinary hail is only five millimeters in diameter, but large hail can reach fifty millimeters. The hail on May 25th was one of the larger types. Hail is usually accompanied by lightning, thunder, and strong winds. Therefore, it often causes serious disasters. Hail disasters are most common in eastern Gansu in spring and summer in our country, and occasionally occur in the North China provinces, while they are relatively rare in the areas south of the Yangtze River.

There are many reasons for strong updrafts, but there are mainly only two types: one is convective, and the other is frontal. In summer, the ground air heats up and rises, and the surrounding colder air descends to replenish it, forming a vertical circulation. This is convection. If the convection is very strong, and the rising height is high, and the air moisture is very abundant, cumulonimbus clouds can be produced and thunderstorms may fall, and occasionally the phenomenon of hail falling can be seen. This type usually has a small range and causes less harm. The other type is frontal. Cold air from the north invades southward, and the warm air in the south is forced to rise, cooling and causing water vapor condensation. If the cold air is very fierce, and the warm air is rich in moisture and unstable, then the warm air is forced to rise violently, so the cloud mass develops particularly large, and thunderstorms and hail are likely to occur. This type has a wide range and causes great harm. The interface between cold and warm air is called a front. Thunderstorms and hail mainly occur in the vicinity of both sides of the front, moving forward with the front.

Convective hail is localized; frontal distribution is relatively broad. The hail area on May 25th was very wide, obviously frontal, and at the same time, the weather chart drawn by the Central Meteorological Observatory confirmed this. On that day, cold air from Siberia invaded south, forcing warm air to rise in western Shanxi, creating strong thunderstorms and hail. As the cold air continued to invade southeast, Shanxi, Pingyuan, and Henan were successively affected, causing widespread hail disasters.

(2) Regarding the prevention of hail from falling, so far, there is no effective method. When hail is falling, collective artillery fire aimed at the sky cannot play any preventive role. First, the range of artillery fire is limited and dispersed. Large-scale hail falling from thousands of feet above has already reached a high speed in the low air, and it can reach the ground in just a few seconds. Even if a very small number of hailstones are hit by artillery shells and broken into pieces, the hail fragments have already fallen to the ground before they melt in a few seconds. Besides, artillery shells cannot be as dense as falling hailstones, and the number that can be broken must be minimal, and it cannot reduce the disaster. If it is said that artillery fire is enough to heat the air layer from the ground to hundreds of feet or higher, so that the hail melts, it is even more impossible, because the thermal energy emitted by artillery fire is limited, and a large amount of thermal energy is needed to heat a vast area (at least several square kilometers) and such a thick layer of air enough to melt the hail.

But why do rural cadres and farmers generally feel that local cannons are effective in fighting hail? This is because: First, according to the causes of hail formation, it can be seen that not all tall and thick black clouds (scientifically called cumulonimbus clouds) can produce hail. Clouds that produce thunderstorms and clouds that produce large or small hail are basically the same. The only difference is that the strength of the updraft is different. Second, hail clouds do not continuously produce hail. Hail only forms when the updraft is particularly strong. Therefore, the duration of hail is always relatively short and intermittent. Also, the same cloud may or may not produce hail as it passes through different areas. Because the updraft strength varies in different parts of the area covered by the same cloud, it is inevitable that hail will fall in some places but not in others, or the size of the hail will be different at the same time. Under such circumstances, it is easy to mistakenly believe that local cannons are effective in fighting hail: ① Black clouds are overhead, but there are no conditions for hail to form. After firing the cannon, it is believed that the hail has been dispersed by the local cannon. ② The area covered by hail clouds does not necessarily produce hail everywhere. Therefore, in areas where hail does not fall, after firing the cannon, it is believed that the hail has been dispersed by the local cannon. If hail falls, it is believed that the firing was too late or not enough or not dense enough. ③ After hail has already fallen, the hail becomes smaller or stops after firing the cannon. This is believed to be the effect of firing the local cannon, but in fact, the duration of hail is not long, and it will not always fall so heavily.

The spirit of fighting nature by firing cannons at hail is good, but this way of fighting cannot have any effect. To fight nature, we must first grasp the laws of natural phenomena, strengthen the advantageous contradictions to become the dominant aspect, in order to effectively overcome natural disasters. Of course, meteorology has not yet progressed to the point of being able to prevent hail from falling, but in the future, we believe that with planned research and efforts, an effective prevention method can always be found.

In addition, the report about the farmers in Qinyuan and Lanxian using "beacon fires" to prevent frost is indeed a very effective scientific method. Although the temperature of the local air near the ground will not be greatly increased as a result, the smoke it emits covers the ground, which can prevent the dissipation of thermal energy from the ground, so that the air temperature near the ground will not drop sharply, which is enough to prevent the occurrence of frost damage. The effect of "beacon fire" frost prevention is not to melt the formed frost into water droplets or water vapor, but to light "beacon fires" in advance (not setting fires, but mainly to produce thick smoke) on nights when frost is likely to form. The dissipation of heat and smoke can fundamentally reduce the possibility of frost formation. This method is scientific, effective, and worth promoting and encouraging. We think that the material for burning "beacon fires" should best be autumn leaves and withered grass. Collect them and pile them into scattered piles of various sizes in the fear-of-frost crop garden, ready for use on relatively cold, clear, and windless nights.

　　关于冰雹和霜害的防止问题
　　人民革命军事委员会气象局
    编者按：关于冰雹能否被控制，以及土枪土炮轰击冰雹能否有效的问题，本报已于八月九日三版发表了中国科学院竺可桢副院长的《人力能克服冰雹吗？》一文，并转载了苏联伊林著《人类征服自然》一书的第七章《天气的话》中的五小节，加以说明。兹再发表人民革命军事委员会气象局《关于冰雹和霜害的防止问题》和刘善本所作《我对于防雹的意见》两文，并将苏联伊林著《人与自然》一书的第十二章“把泼妇驯服了”之一部分加以转载，以进一步说明这一问题。
    北京人民日报在六月十二和十三两日，登载了关于本年五月廿五日在山西、平原、河北、河南四省发生雹灾的详细报道。从这些消息中，我们知道灾区很广阔，灾情也相当严重，很多地方的农民事先已有用土炮防雹的组织，许多人认为很有功效，应该普遍地提倡，同时并引起各界人民的注意和讨论。我们愿意站在气象学的立场，来谈谈下面的几个问题：（一）冰雹产生的原因，（二）炮火防雹问题。
    （一）冰雹是怎样产生的？产生冰雹必须具备三种条件：①强烈的上升气流；②空气中必含有丰富的水份；③上升气流顶部的温度须降低到冰点以下。有了强盛的上升气流，下层的湿空气上升至高空到了某一定高度，空气变冷，水汽含容能力减小，就有凝结现象发生，造成浓厚的积雨云。云的上部温度在冰点以下，水汽凝结成冰粒；下部温度较高，就凝结成水滴，两者之间，还有一层冰和水滴的混合层。这样凝结成的水滴和冰粒，起初都微小，后来因为上升气流时缓时急，水滴和冰粒反复升腾，就逐渐合并成为较大的水滴或冰粒。较大的冰粒下降到较低的高度，如遇着强盛的上升气流，又可以被带到高层，沿途水份附着凝结，至某一高度又冻结起来。如此上升下降若干次，形体终于增大到上升气流不能负荷，即下降为冰雹。上升气流愈强盛，间歇现象愈显著，冰块升降的次数愈多，也就愈大。普通冰雹直径只有五公厘，大的可达五十公厘。五月二十五日的冰雹正是较大的一种。冰雹下降的时候，通常都有雷电狂风伴见。所以往往形成严重的灾害。我国雹灾春夏甘肃东部最常见，华北各省也偶尔有之，长江以南的地区却比较少。
    强烈的上升气流促发的原因很多，但主要的只有两种：一种是对流性的，一种是锋面性的。夏季午后地面空气受热上升，四周较冷的空气下降来补充，形成一个垂直的环流，这便是对流。对流如果很猛烈，上升高度高，而空中水汽又很丰富，便可以产生积雨云并下降雷暴雨，偶或可见冰雹下降的现象，这种通常范围不大，为害较小。另一种是锋面性的。北方冷空气南袭，南方的热空气被迫上升，变冷而发生水汽凝结现象。如果冷空气来势非常凶猛，而热空气水汽丰富又秉性不稳定，那么，热空气被迫猛烈上升，因之云块发展得特别巨大，雷雨和冰雹就有可能发生。这种范围广，为害也大。冷热空气之间的交界面叫做锋面。雷雨和雹主要就产生在锋面两侧的附近地带，随着锋面的前进而向前移动。
    对流性的冰雹是地方性的；锋面性的分布却比较广大。这次五月二十五日的降雹区域很广，显然是锋面性的，同时从中央气象台所绘制的天气图来看，也确切地证实了这一点。那天西伯利亚冷空气南侵，在山西西部把暖空气强迫上升，造成强烈的雷雨和冰雹。由于冷空气续向东南侵袭，山西平原河南次第波及，造成广大区域的雹灾。
    （二）关于阻止冰雹的下降，到目前为止，还没有有效的办法。在有冰雹下降的时候，集体架炮对天空发射，不可能起什么防止作用。第一，炮火的射程有限而且分散，从几千尺高空下降的大范围的冰雹到低空的速度已经很大，只要几秒钟便可以到达地面。即使有极少数的冰雹为炮弹所击中，打成碎块，但是在几秒钟内，冰雹碎块还没有融化以前，已经降落到地面了。何况炮弹无论如何不能像下降的冰雹那样密集，能被打碎的数量一定微乎其微，不能减轻灾害。若说炮火足以使地面到几百尺或更高的气层烧热，使雹融化，则更是不可能的事，因为炮火所发的热能有限，而要把广大区域（至少为几个平方公里），又那样厚的空气层热到足以融化冰雹，却需要很大量的热能。
    但是为什么农村干部和农民一般地都觉到土炮打冰雹是有效的呢？这是因为：一、根据冰雹形成的原因可见并不是所有高大浓厚的黑云（科学上叫积雨云）都可能下冰雹，下雷雨和下大冰雹或小冰雹的云，基本上是相同的，它们的差别只是上升的气流的强弱有不同。二、下冰雹的云，也不是继续地会下冰雹的，只有上升气流特别强盛的场合，才会形成冰雹，因此下冰雹时间上总是相当短促而且是间歇的，并且同是一块云经过的地方，可能有的地方下，有的地方不下；同一块云掩覆的地区，由于各部分上升气流强弱不同，在同一时间里，也必然会这儿下，那儿不下，或者下的大小不一样。在这样的情形下就可能误认土炮打冰雹是有效的：①黑云临头，但没有下冰雹的条件，打了炮就认为冰雹是被土炮打散了。②能下冰雹的云所掩蔽的区域并不是到处都会下冰雹，所以不下冰雹的地方打了土炮，就认为冰雹是被土炮打散了，下了冰雹就认为打的太迟或者打的不够多，不够密。③已经下了冰雹，打了炮后冰雹转小，或者停止，就认为是打土炮的效果，其实冰雹下的时间，原不会长，不会一直下的那么大。
    架炮打冰雹这种和自然斗争的精神是好的，但这种斗争的方式是不可能有任何的效果的。和自然做斗争，首先必须把握住自然现象发生的规律，使有利的矛盾作用加强成为主导的方面，才可能有效地克服自然的灾害。当然到现在气象学还没有进步到能阻止冰雹下降，但是在将来，我们相信在有计划地研究和努力下，总可能发现一种有效的预防的办法。
    此外，报载关于沁源和岚县农民利用“烽火”来防霜的一事，确是很有效的科学方法。因为近地面局部空气的温度，虽不会因此而有大量地增高，然它所发散的烟笼罩着地面，却可以阻止地面热能的发散，使近地空气温度不致于急烈地下降，足以防止霜害的发生。“烽火”防霜的效用，并不是把结成的霜溶化为水滴或水汽，而是在有成霜可能的夜晚，预先放起“烽火”（不是放火主要是使它产生浓烟），热和烟的发散根本就可以使凝霜的可能性大为减少。这种方法是科学的，有效的，值得提倡和鼓励。我们想，烧“烽火”的材料，最好是利用秋天的落叶和枯草，收集起来，在怕霜作物园地上，各处堆成分散的大大小小的堆子，以备在比较冷而晴朗无风的夜晚，随时施放。
