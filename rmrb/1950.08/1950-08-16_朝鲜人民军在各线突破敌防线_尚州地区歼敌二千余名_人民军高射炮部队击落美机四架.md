Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th – The General Headquarters of the Korean People’s Army of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea announced on the evening of the 14th that the People's Army units, on all fronts, continue to launch fierce battles, breaking through the defensive positions of the American troops and remnant puppet troops of Syngman Rhee who attempted to resist stubbornly.

American planes and warships continue their beastly bombing of peaceful residential areas. On August 12th, American warships, including cruisers, intruded into the west coast north of the 38th parallel, attempting to bombard residential areas near Ongjin and Cholsan. However, due to the counterattack of the People's Army coastal artillery units, the enemy warships were quickly repelled. On the 13th, American planes invaded various areas north of the 38th parallel, indiscriminately bombing.

The People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units intercepted enemy planes, shooting down one American plane in Anju; shooting down two American planes in the Nampo area; and shooting down one American plane that invaded the Yeoncheon area, capturing the American pilot alive.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 15th – The General Headquarters of the Korean People’s Army of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea announced on the morning of the 14th that the People's Army units, on all fronts, repelled the stubborn resistance of American troops and remnant puppet troops of Syngman Rhee and continued to launch fierce offensives. The People's Army units that liberated Sangju and its surrounding areas inflicted heavy blows on the enemy and continue to advance, mopping up the enemy stubbornly resisting south of Sangju.

From August 2nd to August 10th, the People's Army units, in their battles in this area, killed or wounded over one thousand five hundred enemy soldiers, captured over five hundred enemies; and seized a large number of spoils of war, including tanks, cars, light and heavy machine guns, carbines, M1 rifles, 105mm artillery shells, and hand grenades.
