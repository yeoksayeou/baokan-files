　　How Soviet On-the-Job Cadres Study Marxism-Leninism on Their Own
　　Li He
    “The higher the political level and the understanding of Marxism-Leninism of the personnel in any work department of the state and the party, the better and more successful the work itself will be, and the more significant the work results…” ——Stalin
    In the Soviet Union, workers, farmers, and office staff generally participate in political and theoretical study, especially party and government cadres. Building a communist society and fighting against the remnants of capitalism in people's minds require a high level of political and theoretical understanding. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) is very concerned about the political and theoretical study of cadres. Comrade Stalin said: "The task of the party's propaganda and the task of the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres is to help all our working cadres master the Marxist-Leninist science of the laws of social development." According to the decision of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the fourth edition of the Complete Works of Lenin and the Complete Works of Stalin are being published successively. The works of Lenin and Stalin have become indispensable sunshine in the lives of Soviet people.
    Self-study is the Basic Method for Studying Marxism-Leninism
    The study of Soviet on-the-job cadres is mainly based on self-study. Only those who do not yet have the ability to study on their own will attend political schools and study classes. The Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), in its decision on party propaganda made when the Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) was published in 1938, clearly pointed out that the basic method of study for Soviet party, government cadres, and intellectuals is to study the history and theory of the Bolshevik Party on their own. This decision stated: "We must break a harmful prejudice that it seems Marxism-Leninism can only be studied in groups, while in fact, self-study is the main and basic method of studying Marxism-Leninism." Currently, in Moscow alone, there are more than 100,000 people studying politics and theory on their own.
    The Leading Role of Party Organizations
    Soviet on-the-job cadres have many courses to study. For example, the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Political Economy, Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, Soviet History, Soviet Foreign Policy and International Relations, etc., are all compulsory courses. These courses are generally completed within two years. Because cadres have different levels and requirements, organizing self-study is a very complex task, and the leadership of party organizations is very important.
    The party organizations that lead self-study have many detailed tasks to do. They must investigate the requirements of self-study participants, help them select appropriate courses, select tutors, organize research groups, set up libraries, and supervise learning, etc.
    Party organizations formulate different study plans and book lists according to the different requirements of self-study participants; then, according to the different levels of self-study participants, they recommend these plans to them separately. For example, for those who are just starting self-study, party organizations recommend the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) for them to read; for those who have already developed the habit of self-study, they guide them to read Lenin's and Stalin's works related to the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) when they are studying it; for those who have considerable cultivation, they are encouraged to study Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism, Political Economy, Soviet History, Soviet Foreign Policy, etc. If, when starting to choose courses, inexperienced self-study participants are allowed to make rash decisions without considering their own conditions, then all kinds of difficulties will occur in the middle of self-study.
    Party organizations usually understand the situation of self-study participants through conversations. During the 1948-1949 academic year, the party organization of the workshop of the Molotov Automobile Factory in Gorky City conducted individual conversations with hundreds of Communist Party members, and through these conversations, they gained a good understanding of the level of cultivation of each of them, so they were able to help them correctly choose courses.
    Party organizations try their best to allow each self-study participant to study the required courses according to their own abilities, time, and requirements. However, this does not mean that the organization's leadership and supervision can be weakened or relaxed. Not giving self-study participants any help usually, and only calling on self-study participants to report on what they have read at meetings at a certain time—this kind of leadership style has long been criticized as a bureaucratic style in the Soviet Union. What is now advocated and widely applied is another method, that is, the person in charge of the organization and the self-study participants hold individual conversations. This kind of conversation is not formal, sudden, or interrogative, but is for truly understanding the learning situation of self-study participants, and for organizing systematic help for self-study participants.
    Make Study Plans and Write Study Notes
    Naturally, the organization's help can only play an auxiliary role, and the acquisition of knowledge mainly depends on one's own systematic study and unremitting efforts. Kalinin said to the members of the Communist Youth League in 1934: "I am also a very busy person, but I have to set aside time to read books every day. I have to read at least eight or nine pages of Marxist books every day, not documents. In addition to this, I have to read some newly published literary works." Kalinin's method of squeezing out time to continuously read Marxist-Leninist books has become an example for Soviet Marxist-Leninist self-study participants.
    In order to facilitate self-supervision and better manage time, self-study participants always formulate personal study plans based on the study outlines and book lists recommended by the organization. Balagin, a Communist Party member in Kuibyshev City who was studying the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on his own, said: "The plan for individual study of various works has given me a lot of help in my study. In the plan, I estimated in advance how many hours it would take to read a chapter of the book, when I should finish reading supplementary reading materials, and when I should write a summary. I cannot say that my personal plan is completed without any deviation, but it always constrains me and improves my sense of responsibility to study hard within the specified time."
    Writing a summary has been recognized as a very beneficial method in self-study. It can help learners deepen their understanding of the content of the book, systematically and comprehensively understand theories and materials, strengthen the memory of the knowledge gained, hone logical thinking, and it is also a kind of self-supervision. One self-study participant described his experience in studying socialist political economy: "After reading the books that were introduced, I wrote a summary according to the subject. For example, when studying the course "Socialist Property" on my own, I read the first and second chapters of the "Communist Manifesto," Lenin's speech on the nationalization of banks in December 1917, Lenin's thesis "The Impending Catastrophe and How to Avert It" and "On Cooperation." I also read Comrade Stalin's report "On the Draft Constitution of the Soviet Union," the Soviet Constitution and other works. After reading these books and thinking about them carefully, I began to list the basic questions for making a summary, and then a short summary was written."
    After completing a course on one's own, if necessary, write a report paper to describe the basic ideas of the issue studied. When preparing this report paper, the self-study participant must carefully study relevant books, magazines, and newspapers, select statistical figures and factual materials, and link them to reality. Writing this kind of report paper can deepen the self-study participant's understanding and thinking ability. Kalinin said to teachers in 1938: "...If you want to understand Marxism-Leninism and master this theory, then making reports, writing report papers, and conducting debates on the basis of self-study will be of great benefit to you." The party organization of the Voronezh "Electric Signal" factory formulated 100 optional report paper topics before the start of the 1948-1949 academic year. For those who are studying dialectical materialism and historical materialism on their own, the topics recommended by the party organization are: "Comrade Stalin's Development of Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism," "Lenin's Struggle against Machism," "The Bankruptcy and Fallacies of Modern Bourgeois Sociology," "Dialectical Materialism and Modern Chemistry," "The Struggle between Materialism and Idealism in Biology," etc. Prahochdeki, the chief engineer of the factory, wrote a report paper entitled "Science and Technology in the New Stalin Five-Year Plan," analyzed the work of the factory, made a summary, and put forward valuable suggestions. After the self-study participant's report paper is written, it should be sent to the comrades who participated in judging the paper together with the bibliography.
    Learning is mainly based on self-study, which does not exclude collective discussion. In order to exchange opinions, and to check whether there are errors or deviations in ideological understanding, discussion meetings are indispensable. Kalinin said: "Collective discussion should be combined with self-study as the basic method. Prepare the questions at home, report at the group and at the conference, and carry out discussions based on the reports. Do not carry out mechanical discussions, but let everyone express their opinions on the issue, and do not be afraid to say what they want to say."
    Sometimes, one or two people make reports (central speeches) at the discussion meetings, and then everyone discusses; sometimes, discussions are conducted directly without inviting people to make reports. But no matter which type, the discussion outline or questions must be sent to the participants in advance, and the participants must prepare in advance. Do not hold unprepared meetings. What the organizers of the meeting should pay attention to is mainly how to help the participants prepare their reports or speeches, rather than convening meetings on schedule.
    Guides and Organizers of Self-Study
    The party organization's systematic assistance to self-study participants is often achieved through tutors and research group instructors. This method of assistance is most prevalent in Moscow.
    After understanding the situation of self-study participants through conversations, the party organization decides to select several tutors and what kind of tutors to help the self-study participants. Tutors are responsible for answering individual or collective questions, organizing discussion meetings and report paper evaluation meetings, and are responsible for guiding all matters related to learning. They are a kind of propaganda personnel and must report their work to the party organization regularly. Those who are selected as tutors are all those who have theoretical cultivation, have expertise in a certain field of knowledge, and have rich experience in self-study. Whether the tutors are selected properly or not has a great impact on the learning prospects of the self-study participants. Therefore, the party organization pays great attention to the training of tutors. The party organizations in Moscow, Leningrad, Gorky, Chelyabinsk and other cities specifically hold research classes for tutors, teach various theoretical courses, and study the working methods of tutors. All 690 tutors in the Petrogradsky District of Leningrad systematically improved their knowledge in educational institutions such as the Marxist-Leninist Night University.
    The tutor responsibly serves as a consultant for self-study participants. The tutor must provide guiding opinions and clear answers on the steps and plans for self-study participants to carry out their studies, on the methods of writing study notes, on questions about a certain issue, on writing report papers, etc. Tutors are not passive, waiting for people to ask questions. They are active organizers of self-study of Marxist-Leninist theory.
    Shi Lobozhnikov, a tutor in Moscow, when guiding self-study participants to study Lenin's book "What Is To Be Done?" during the 1948-1949 academic year, pointed out to them to pay attention to the historical background of Lenin's struggle against the "Economists" in 1903, recommended that they read Chapter 2 of the Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), and guided them to observe the modern communist movement and the struggle against the right wing of the Social Democratic Party using the ideas in Lenin's book. Danilenko, a tutor at the Moscow "Revolutionary Spark" printing factory, said that he focused his main attention on individual help to political self-study participants. In the process of conversations, he not only guided self-study participants to understand a certain work, to know historical materials and situations, but also guided them to link theory with the current actual situation. Ye Jin, a tutor at the Leningrad "Electric Power" factory, after the self-study participant Panteleyev finished studying Chapter 9 of the Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), checked the summary he wrote and found that the self-study participant did not understand the essence of the New Economic Policy enough, so he asked him to review the relevant materials and rewrite the summary; during the second check, the self-study participant was already able to thoroughly explain the essence of the New Economic Policy. When the self-study participant is preparing to write a report paper, the tutor helps him choose the topic and reference books according to the self-study participant's level, reviews the writing outline, and supplements and revises it. After the paper is written, the tutor reviews it and points out the places that should be supplemented or modified. The tutor also organizes discussion meetings for self-study participants according to the needs of learning.
    Therefore, the work of a tutor is complex. One tutor can guide at most six to eight self-study participants. Tutors must have a manual to record the study plans of each self-study participant, the questions raised, the degree of understanding of the courses, etc.
    Research Groups
    Research groups are also a way to help self-study participants that is most popular in Moscow. More than 30,000 of the 100,000 self-study participants in Moscow participate in research group studies. Research groups are affiliated to the party's provincial committees, municipal committees, district committees, and branch committees of large enterprises or institutions. Learners with the same cultural and political level are grouped together, with each group having 15 to 20 people. The study period for these research groups is one and a half to two years. Each research group has classes twice a month, each time for four hours. The allocation of time is as follows: studying the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and original works—120 hours, dialectical materialism and historical materialism—100 hours, political economy—100 hours, Soviet economy—90 hours, Soviet foreign policy and current international relations—90 hours.
    In research groups, the instructor plays a decisive role. The work content and achievements of the research group are related to the instructor's ability, experience, and enthusiasm. The instructor of the research group must be selected and approved by the party's district committee. Some instructors are university professors, some are deputy ministers, and some are factory directors. The members of the research group must be carefully reviewed by the instructor and determined by the party's branch committee. It is not allowed for the level of researchers to be uneven or to join the group halfway.
    The study in research groups is generally conducted as follows: the research group instructor first gives an enlightening lecture. The listeners take notes on it. The instructor introduces reference books, points out the central issues, and assigns the topics of the report papers, assigning these topics to the listeners to prepare. After a certain period, everyone in the research group listens to the reports of the preparers and conducts discussions. Finally, the instructor makes a summary: giving appropriate evaluations of the reports and speeches, explaining ambiguous questions, and correcting the errors in the reports and speeches. Then, the instructor gives another lecture for the next study. Research groups can also conduct discussions without reports; in this case, the questions for discussion should be prepared in advance.
    The study plan of the research group is jointly formulated by the instructor and the party branch committee. In order to guide the listeners to systematically study important issues, the instructor announces the entire teaching plan to the research group at the beginning. The instructor also often takes the initiative to collect the questions of the researchers, understand their difficulties, and provide timely help. The more energetic the research group, the more often individual questions and conversations are held. Sometimes, many researchers are interested in certain issues, so collective questions are held. Sometimes, the questions are very complex, so conversations on theoretical issues are held.
    Libraries and Newspapers—Advisors for Self-Study Participants
    In addition, cadres who study Marxist-Leninist theory on their own can also get help from libraries anytime and anywhere; because Soviet libraries not only manage borrowing books, but also serve as volunteer learning consultants. Cadres who study Marxist-Leninist theory on their own can also read concise essays in newspapers from the central to the local level, because systematically, repeatedly, and in combination with fresh things to promote Marxism-Leninism is the primary task of Soviet newspapers.

　　苏联在职干部怎样自修马列主义
　　李何
    “国家和党的任何工作部门的人员，其政治水平和马列主义的认识愈高，工作本身就愈好和愈有成绩，工作效果就愈显著……”  ——斯大林
    在苏联，工人、农民和机关的职员，一般说来没有不参加政治和理论学习的，党的干部或政府干部更是如此。建设共产主义社会，跟人们意识中的资本主义余孽作斗争，都需要高度的政治水平和理论水平。联共中央是非常关心干部的政治和理论学习的。斯大林同志说过：“党的宣传的任务，干部的马列主义教育的任务，在于帮助我们一切工作干部去掌握马列主义关于社会发展规律的科学”。根据联共中央的决定，列宁全集第四版和斯大林全集，正在陆续出版。列宁和斯大林的著作已成为苏联人生活中不可缺少的阳光。
    自学是学习马列主义的基本方法
    苏联在职干部的学习，是以自修为主的。只有那些还没有自修能力的人，才进政治学校和学习班。联共中央在一九三八年联共党史简明教程出版时所作的关于党的宣传的决定中，曾明确地指出：苏联党、政干部和知识分子的基本学习方法，是自修布尔什维克党的历史和理论。这一决定说：“必须打破一种有害的偏见，似乎只能在小组中学习马列主义，而实际上，自学是研究马列主义的主要和基本的方法”。现在仅在莫斯科一地，自修政治和理论的就在十万人以上。
    党组织的领导作用
    苏联在职干部要学习的课程很多。比如：联共党史、政治经济学、辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、苏联历史、苏联外交政策和国际关系等，都是必修的课程。这些课程一般地要在两年之内修完。由于干部的程度不同和要求不同，组织自修是非常复杂的工作，而党组织的领导也就非常重要。
    领导自修的党的组织，有很多细腻工作要做。它要调查自修者的要求，帮他们选择适当的课程，挑选解答人，组织研究组，布置图书室和督促学习等等。
    党的组织根据自修者的不同要求，分类拟订不同的学习计划和图书目录；然后，又根据自修者的不同程度，分别向他们推荐这些计划。例如：对于刚开始自修的人，党的组织推荐联共党史给他们读；对于已经养成自修习惯的人，就指导他们在学习联共党史的时候，阅读有关的列宁斯大林的著作；对于有相当修养的人，则鼓励他们研究辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义、政治经济学、苏联历史、苏联对外政策等等。如果在开始选择课程的时候，放任没有经验的自修者不按自己的条件而轻率决定，那么，自修就会中途发生种种困难。
    党的组织通常是通过谈话来了解自修者的情形的。在一九四八到一九四九的学年内，高尔基城莫洛托夫汽车制造厂车间的党组织，曾经跟几百个共产党员进行了个别谈话，由谈话中很好地了解了他们每个人的修养程度，因而能够帮助他们正确地选择课程。
    党的组织尽量让每一个自修者按照自己的能力、时间和要求，来研究必修的课程。然而这并不是说组织的领导和督促可以削弱或放松。平常不给自修者任何帮助，仅仅到一定的时候叫自修者在会议上汇报一下所读的东西——这种领导方式，在苏联早就被批判为官僚主义的方式了。现在加以提倡并广泛应用着的是另外的方式，即组织的负责人和自修者举行个别谈话。这种谈话不是形式的、突击式的和考问式的，而是为了真正了解自修者的学习情形，为了组织对自修者的有系统的帮助。
    订学习计划，写学习心得
    自然，组织的帮助只能起协助的作用，而学问的取得，主要是靠自己有系统的钻研，和坚持不懈的努力。加里宁在一九三四年对共产主义青年团员就说过这样的话：“我也是工作很忙的人，但我每天都要分出时间来看书。我每天至少要读八九页不是文件而是马克思主义的书籍。除此以外，还要看些新出版的文艺作品”。加里宁这种挤出时间来不间断地阅读马列主义书籍的方法，已成为苏联自修马列主义者的范例。
    自修者为了便于自我督促和很好地支配时间，总是根据组织推荐的学习提纲和图书目录，拟订出个人的学习计划。古比雪夫城一个自修联共党史的共产党员巴拉金说：“个人研究各种著作的计划，在学习当中给了我很大帮助。在计划中，我预先估计要花几个钟头来读完书的那一章，什么时候应当读完补充读物，什么时候应当写概要。我不能够说，我的个人计划是毫厘不爽地完成着，可是它总是约束着我，提高我在规定时间内锐意研读的责任心”。
    写概要已被公认为自修中非常有益的方法。它可以帮助学习者加深领会书的内容，有系统地、全面地了解理论和材料，加强对所得的知识的记忆，磨炼思想逻辑，同时也是一种自我督促。有一个自修者叙述他自修社会主义政治经济学的经验说：“在读完被介绍的书籍之后，我按课目写概要。譬如，自修《社会主义财产》这一课时，我读完了《共产党宣言》的第一、第二章，列宁一九一七年十二月关于银行国有化的演说，列宁的论文《灾祸临头和防止之法》和《论合作制》。还读完了斯大林同志的《关于苏联宪法草案》的报告，苏联宪法及其他著作。读完这些书，并且好好地思考一下之后，我才开始列出作概要的基本问题，后来简短的概要便写出来了。”
    自修完某一门功课之后，如果有必要，就写报告论文，叙述所研究的问题的基本思想。在准备这种报告论文的时候，自修者要很好地研究有关的书籍、杂志、报纸，选择统计数字以及事实材料，并且联系实际。写这种报告论文，可以加深自修者的认识和思考能力。加里宁在一九三八年就对教员们说过这样的话：“……如果你们想了解马列主义，并掌握这一理论，那么，在自修的基础上去作报告、写报告论文和进行辩论，这对你们都会有极大的益处”。伏罗内兹“电力信号”工厂的党的组织，在一九四八——一九四九学年开始前，拟订了一百个供选择的报告论文题目。对于自修辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的人们。党组织推荐的题目是：“斯大林同志对于辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的发挥”，“列宁跟马赫主义的斗争”，“现代资产阶级社会学的破产和谬误”，“辩证唯物主义和现代化学”，“生物学中唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争”等等。该工厂总工程师普拉何德克里，写了一篇题为《新的斯大林五年计划中的科学和技术》的报告论文，分析该工厂的工作，并作出总结，提出了宝贵的建议。自修者的报告论文写好之后，要连同参考书目录一起，发给参加评判这一论文的同志们。
    学习以自修为主，这并不排斥集体讨论。为了交换意见，为了检查思想认识有无错误或偏差，讨论会是不可少的，加里宁说过：“集体讨论应当与作为基本方式的自修结合起来。要在家里把问题准备好，在小组上，在大会上去做报告，根据报告来开展讨论。不是开展机械的讨论，而是要每个人说出自己对于该问题的意见，不要害怕讲出自己要讲的话”。
    讨论会有时由一两个人作报告（中心发言），然后大家进行讨论；也有不请人作报告就直接进行讨论的。但不管那一种，都要预先把讨论提纲或问题发给与会者，与会者都要预先准备。不能开无准备的会。组织会议的人所要注意的，主要是怎样帮助与会者准备好报告或发言，而不是按期召集会议。
    自学的指导者与组织者
    党的组织对于自修者的有系统的帮助，常常通过解答人和研究组指导人来实现。这种帮助方式，在莫斯科最为盛行。
    党的组织在经过谈话，了解了自修者的情况之后，就决定挑选若干解答人和怎样的解答人来帮助自修者。解答人负责解答个人或集体的质疑，组织讨论会和报告论文评判会，负责指导有关学习的一切事宜。他是一种宣教人员，要定期向党的组织汇报工作。被挑选当解答人的、都是有理论修养的，对某一门知识有专长的，对自修有丰富经验的人。解答人选择得当与否，对于自修者的学习前途，影响极大。所以党的组织非常注意解答人的培养。莫斯科、列宁格勒、高尔基、车里雅宾斯克及其他城市的党的组织，专门举办解答人的研究班，讲授各种理论课程和研究解答人的工作方法。列宁格勒城的彼得罗格勒斯基区全部六百九十个解答人，都是在马列主义夜间大学等教育机关里有系统地提高了自己的知识的。
    解答人负责地担任自修者的顾问。关于自修者进行学习的步骤和计划，关于写读书笔记的方法，关于某一问题的质疑，关于写报告论文等等，解答人都要提供指导性的意见，都要有明确的答复。解答人不是被动的，等待人家提问题的。他是自修马列主义理论的积极组织者。
    莫斯科的解答人史洛波疆尼科夫，在一九四八——一九四九学年指导自修者研究列宁的《做什么》一书的时候，指点他们注意一九○三年列宁跟“经济主义者”斗争的时代背景，推荐联共党史简明教程第二章给他们读，引导他们用列宁这本书的思想来观察现代共产主义运动以及跟社会民主党右派斗争的问题。莫斯科“革命火花”印刷厂的一个解答人丹尼连科说：他把基本注意力放在个别帮助政治自修者上，在谈话的过程中，他不但指导自修者去领会某一著作，去知道历史材料和情况，而且指引他们把理论和当前实际情况联系起来。列宁格勒“电力”工厂的一个解答人叶金，在自修者潘捷列耶夫学完联共党史简明教程第九章之后，检查他写的概要，发现自修者对于新经济政策的实质了解得不够，就叫他复习有关的材料，重写概要；第二次检查时，自修者已经能够透彻地说明新经济政策的实质了。当自修者准备写报告论文的时候，解答人根据自修者的水平，帮助他选择题目和参考书，审阅写作提纲，并加以补充、修正。论文写好后，由解答人加以审阅，指出应补充或修改的地方。解答人还按照学习的需要，组织自修者的讨论会。
    所以，解答人的工作是繁复的。一个解答人最多只能指导六个到八个的自修者。解答人必须备有手册，记下各个自修者的学习计划，质疑的问题，对课程了解的程度等等。
    研究组
    研究组，也是莫斯科最盛行的一种帮助自修者学习的方式。莫斯科十万自修者中就有三万人以上参加研究组学习。研究组附属于党的省委、市委、区委和大企业或机关的支委。由同等文化与政治水平的学习者组成一组，每组以十五人到二十人为度。这些研究组学习的期限为一年半到两年。各研究组每月上课两次，每次四小时。钟点的分配如下：研究联共党史及原著——一百二十小时，辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义——一百小时，政治经济学——一百小时，苏维埃经济——九十小时，苏联外交政策和当前国际关系——九十小时。
    在研究组里，指导人起着决定作用。研究组的工作内容和成绩，都与指导人的能力、经验和积极性有关。研究组的指导人要经过党的区委的挑选和批准。有的指导人是大学教授，有的是副部长，有的是厂长。研究组的组员，须经过指导人的慎重审查，并且由党的支委确定。不允许研究员程度参差不齐或半途插入组内。
    研究组的学习一般是这样进行的：研究组指导人先作一次启发性的讲演。听讲人把它笔记下来。指导人介绍参考书，指出中心问题，指定报告论文的题目，把这些题目分配给听讲人去准备。过了一定期间，在研究组内大家听取准备者的报告，并进行讨论。最后由指导人作总结：给报告和发言以恰当的评价，解释含糊的问题，纠正报告和发言中的错误。然后，指导人另作一次讲演，供下一次研究。研究组没有报告也可以进行讨论；在这种情形下要预先拟出讨论的问题来。
    研究组的学习计划，由指导人和党支委会共同制定。指导人为了引导听讲者有系统地研究重要问题，一开始就向研究组宣布全部讲授计划。指导人还经常主动地收集研究员的疑问，了解他们的困难，及时给以帮助。愈是有生气的研究组，举行个别质疑和谈话的时候也愈多。有时候，许多研究员对于某些问题都有兴趣，那么就举行集体质疑。有时候，问题非常复杂，那么就举行理论问题的谈话。
    图书馆和报纸——自修者的顾问
    除此以外，自修马列主义理论的干部还可以随时随地获得图书馆的帮助；因为苏联的图书馆不但管借书，而且当义务的学习顾问。自修马列主义理论的干部还可以从中央到地方的报纸上阅读简明扼要的论文，因为有系统地、反复地、跟新鲜事物结合着宣传马列主义，是苏联报纸的首要任务。
