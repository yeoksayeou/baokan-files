Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces have completed the harvesting of early rice. The yields are generally above 80% of normal years, and the harvest is better than last year.

　　Jiangxi Province has a bumper harvest of early rice this year, with an average yield of about 300 jin per mu. Poyang, Yugan, and Wannian, three counties that have suffered from floods for years, have a 100% harvest this year, with the highest yield reaching 700 jin per mu. According to preliminary estimates, the total output of early rice in the province this year is about 2.08 billion jin, an increase of about 200 million jin over last year. Hubei Province completed the harvesting of early rice at the end of July. The province's Yangtze River area has about 7 million mu of early rice. Except for some areas that suffered from floods, most areas have reported a bumper harvest. The early rice harvest in the Hanchuan area even reached 100%. Although Hunan Province experienced drought after the summer, the early rice harvest was not greatly affected. The Dongting Lake area even increased production by 10% to 15% compared to last year.

　　After the early rice harvest, farmers in Hubei and Hunan provinces immediately began transplanting late rice. At present, most areas in the Huanggang, Daye, and Xiaogan regions of Hubei have completed transplanting late rice seedlings. Among the 160,000 mu of cultivated land affected by the disaster in Yunmeng County, nearly 120,000 mu of flooded land have been replanted with crops. Most of the late rice seedlings in Hunan Province were planted at the beginning of this month, and farmers in the province are now busy preparing to harvest mid-season rice.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 19th: With the general bumper harvest of early rice, Hunan has basically overcome the severe summer famine. This province suffered a serious summer famine during May and June, and some areas experienced water and drought disasters. At that time, the provincial people's government successively allocated about 170 million jin of grain for production and famine relief. Later, it used all of the existing 302 million jin of public grain to purchase local products, issue loans for flood and drought prevention, and carry out large-scale price stabilization, striving to achieve "no stale grain in the warehouses and no hungry people in the fields." These measures by the people's government greatly increased the enthusiasm of farmers for production. They responded to the call of the people's government, actively repaired ponds and dams, and developed sideline production, striving to fight against the summer famine. After obtaining government loans for planting, a total of 39 counties including Liuyang, Yongming, and Dongan repaired 88,854 reservoirs and ponds, more than 1,300 canals, and 30,018 waterwheels, benefiting more than 1.74 million mu of cultivated land. The vigorous purchase of local products by state-owned trading agencies in various places has also stimulated the gradual recovery of handicraft and sideline production. The rural economy has now begun to become active, and the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas has also become prosperous. After Shaoyang, Lingling, and other counties purchased more than 15,000 bolts of local cloth with public grain, more than 400 looms resumed production, and the livelihood of 5,000 to 6,000 workers was solved. These efforts, coupled with large amounts of price-stabilized grain and bank loans, as well as sideline production activities such as digging lotus roots, chopping firewood, burning lime, and fishing by farmers in various places, have enabled the province to successfully overcome the once-severe summer famine.

　　赣鄂湘早稻丰收
    湖北湖南紧张插种晚稻
    湘省严重夏荒基本度过
    【本报讯】据新华社消息：江西、湖北、湖南等省早稻已收割完毕。一般年景均在八成以上，收获量都较去年为好。
    江西省今年早稻丰收，平均每亩收获量都在三百斤左右。鄱阳、余干，万年三个连年遭受水灾的县份今年有十成年景，最高产量达到七百市斤。据初步估计，今年该省早稻总产量约达二十亿八千余万市斤，较去年增产二亿市斤左右。湖北省早稻已于七月底收割完毕，该省沿江地区约有七百万亩早稻，除有部分地区遭受水灾外，其余大部地区均告丰收。汉川地区的早稻收获量更达到十成。湖南省入夏后虽曾呈旱象，但早稻收成未受很大影响。洞庭湖滨一带还比去年增产了一成到一成半以上。
    早稻收割后，湖北、湖南两省农民紧接着即进行晚稻插秧。现湖北黄冈、大冶、孝感等专区大部地区已插完晚秧。云梦县十六万亩受灾耕地中，已有近十二万亩水淹地补种上庄稼。湖南省晚秧本月初已大部种完，现该省农民正在忙于准备收割中稻。
    【新华社长沙十九日电】随着早稻的普遍丰收，湖南各地已基本上度过了严重的夏荒。今年五、六月间该省夏荒曾相当严重，部分地区发生水、旱等灾。当时，省人民政府曾陆续拨发了生产度荒贷粮约一亿七千万斤以后，又以现存公粮三亿零二百万斤，全部用以收购土产，发放防洪、防旱等贷粮，并办理大量平粜，力求作到“仓无陈粮，野无饥民”。人民政府的这些措施，使农民生产情绪大为提高。他们响应人民政府的号召，积极修塘、筑坝并发展副业生产，努力与夏荒斗争。在获得政府贷种后，浏阳、永明、东安等三十九个县总共修复了蓄水池塘八万八千八百五十四口，水渠一千三百余条，水车三万零十八架，受益耕地达一百七十四万亩以上。各地国营贸易机关大力收购土产，也刺激了手工业和副业生产的逐渐恢复。现在农村经济已开始活跃，城乡物资交流亦从而转旺。邵阳、零陵等县以公粮收购土布一万五千多匹后，四百多台织布机恢复了生产，五、六千工人的生活问题遂得以解决。这些工作加上大量的平粜粮和银行贷款，以及各地农民进行挖藕、砍柴、烧石灰、捕鱼等副业生产，遂使该省一度严重的夏荒得以顺利度过。
