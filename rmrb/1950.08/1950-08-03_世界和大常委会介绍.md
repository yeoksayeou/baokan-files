　　Introduction to the World Peace Congress Standing Committee
    Question: What kind of organization is the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace? What important work has it done since its establishment?
    Answer: The Standing Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace was created by the World Congress of Defenders of Peace held simultaneously in Paris and Prague from April 20th to 25th last year. It is the leading body of international peace and democratic forces organized on a world scale to fight for world peace.
    As early as shortly after the end of World War II, with the imperialist bloc headed by the United States increasingly and frantically preparing for a new war, the people of the world, led by the working classes of all countries, increasingly and universally launched a struggle against war and for peace. In late August 1948, outstanding cultural workers from all over the world held a Congress for the Defense of Peace in Wrocław, Poland, and established the International Liaison Committee. On February 25, 1949, the Liaison Committee and the Women's International Democratic Federation jointly proposed to convene the World Congress of Defenders of Peace in Paris on April 20. With the enthusiastic support of the people of all countries, the congress was held as scheduled. However, due to the obstruction of the reactionary French government, representatives from many countries could not enter Paris, and it was temporarily agreed to hold the congress simultaneously in Paris and Prague. After the close of the congress, the Standing Committee elected by the congress was responsible for leading and promoting the work of defending world peace. According to the report of Secretary-General of the Standing Committee, Lafferte, at the Stockholm meeting in March 1950, 1 billion organized people in 81 countries around the world had participated in the great struggle for peace.
    Up to now, the World Peace Congress Standing Committee has held a total of three plenary sessions. The first was held in Paris on April 26 last year, electing the chairman, vice-chairman, and secretary-general, and organizing the executive bureau, which was responsible for implementing resolutions and promoting work during the adjournment of the Standing Committee's plenary session. The second was the Rome meeting in late October last year, and the third was the Stockholm meeting in mid-March this year. Both meetings summarized the world peace movement in the previous period, put forward new central tasks, and then implemented them into the struggle of the people of all countries to defend peace.
    Specifically, the Standing Committee has carried out the following important tasks.
    (1) Promoting and assisting countries in holding national peace congresses or other peace meetings, publicizing and implementing the resolutions of the World Congress, and regularly carrying out organizational work. More than 30 countries have now held national peace congresses. Peace movement organizations have been established in 81 countries, including national peace committees in 52 countries, and local peace committees have been widely organized in many countries. Thus, as Malenkov pointed out in his report on the October Revolution Day in 1949: the peace movement is powerful because it is developing on a solid organizational foundation, and this foundation is becoming increasingly strong.
    (2) Calling on the people of all countries to hold an "International Day of Struggle for Peace" on October 2 last year, launching a huge demonstration on a global scale to show the irresistible strength of peace defenders. On this day, in 60 countries, millions of men and women responded to the call, took to the streets, and shouted "No War," demonstrating their strength and determination to fight for peace. Such a simultaneous and unified action by the people of sixty countries marked an important stage in the development of the movement to defend world peace.
    (3) After the Rome meeting, the Standing Committee launched a movement to request parliaments of various countries to accept its peace proposals. The main proposals were: 1. Stop the colonial wars being waged in Greece, Vietnam, Indonesia and Malaya. 2. Immediately reduce armaments and prohibit and destroy atomic weapons. 3. Sign a five-power pact to strengthen peace within the United Nations. The Standing Committee notified the parliaments of various countries of the above proposals in December last year; and in February this year, it sent delegations to visit the parliaments of many countries to deliver them directly. These proposals have won the heartfelt support of the Soviet Union, the people's democratic countries, and peace-loving people all over the world. However, they were unreasonably rejected by the governments of the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands, thus more clearly dividing the lines between the peace camp and the war camp in front of the broad masses of the people all over the world, and thereby isolating the war-mongering clique.
    (4) The Standing Committee's Stockholm meeting passed the Peace Declaration. A large-scale signature campaign was launched worldwide to demand the banning of atomic weapons. In early July, due to the US imperialism's open armed aggression against Korea, the Standing Committee sent a telegram to the Korean people, expressing its solidarity, and called on peace supporters all over the world to more actively expand the peace signature campaign. The signature campaign has since further surged. By the end of July, 250 million people worldwide had participated in the signature campaign. This signature campaign has greatly expanded and is still expanding the ranks of peace supporters, exposing the ugly faces of the war-mongers who hope to use atomic bombs to devour people, thereby making them even more isolated.
    Now, the people of the world are expanding the signature campaign to welcome the Second World Peace Congress scheduled to be held in Warsaw in mid-October. It is foreseeable that this World Peace Congress will achieve even greater achievements and push the movement to defend world peace to a higher stage.

　　世界和大常委会介绍
    问：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会是怎样一个组织？它成立以后做了那些重要工作？
    【答】世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，是由去年四月二十日至二十五日在巴黎和布拉格同时举行的世界拥护和平大会产生的，这是国际和平民主力量在世界规模内组织起来的为世界和平而斗争的领导机构。
    早在第二次世界大战结束后不久，随着以美国为首的帝国主义集团日益疯狂地准备新战争，以各国工人阶级为首的全世界人民，就日益普遍地展开了反对战争拥护和平的斗争。一九四八年八月下旬，全世界优秀的文化工作者，在波兰的罗克劳，举行了保卫和平大会，成立了国际联络委员会。一九四九年二月廿五日，该联络委员会和国际民主妇女联合会联合建议于四月二十日在巴黎召开世界拥护和平大会。在各国人民热烈的支持下，大会如期举行。但是由于法国反动政府的阻挠，许多国家的代表不能进入巴黎，临时约定在巴黎和布拉格同时举行。大会闭幕后，由大会选出了常委会负责领导和推动保卫世界和平的工作。到一九五○年三月，据常委会总书记拉斐德在斯德哥尔摩会议上的报告，全世界已有八十一个国家的十万万有组织的人民，参加了争取和平的伟大斗争。
    到现在为止，世界和大常委会一共举行了三次全体会议。第一次，去年四月二十六日在巴黎举行，选出主席、副主席及总书记，组织执行局，在常委会全体会议闭会期间，负责执行决议，推动工作。第二次是去年十月下旬的罗马会议，第三次是今年三月中旬的斯德哥尔摩会议，这两次会议都总结了前一时期的世界和平运动，提出了新的中心任务，然后贯彻到各国人民保卫和平的斗争中。
    具体讲来，常委会已经进行了如下一些重要的工作。
    （一）推动并协助各国举行全国和平大会或其他和平会议，宣传与执行世界和大决议，并经常进行组织工作。现在已经有三十多个国家举行了全国和平大会。八十一个国家建立了和平运动的组织，其中五十二国成立了全国和平委员会，许多国家中并且广泛地组织了地方和平委员会。这样，正如马林可夫在一九四九年十月革命节的报告中所已经指明的：和平运动之所以强大，原因之一，在于它是在一个巩固的组织基础上发展着的，这个基础正愈来愈加强固。
    （二）号召各国人民在去年十月二日举行“国际和平斗争日”，发动了全世界规模的巨大示威，以表示和平保卫者不可抗拒的力量。在这一天，在六十个国家中，有千千万万的男女，响应号召，跑到大街上，高呼“不要战争”，显示出他们为和平而斗争的力量和决心。这样一个六十国人民的同时一致行动，标志着保卫世界和平运动向前发展的重要阶段。
    （三）罗马会议后，常委会展开了一个要求各国议会接受它的和平建议的运动，这些建议主要的有：一、停止在希腊、越南、印尼和马来亚等地进行的殖民战争。二、立即缩减军备，禁止并销毁原子武器。三、在联合国机构内签订五强加强和平公约。常委会于去年十二月，将上述建议通告各国国会；并于今年二月派遣代表团分访许多国家的国会，直接递送。这些建议赢得了苏联、人民民主国家与全世界爱好和平人民的衷心拥护。但却受到美国、英国和荷兰等国政府的无理拒绝，这样就在全世界广大人民面前，更清楚地划分了和平阵营与战争阵营的界线，并从而孤立了战贩集团。
    （四）常委会斯德哥尔摩会议通过了和平宣言。展开了一个全世界要求禁用原子武器的大规模的签名运动。七月初，由于美帝国主义公开武装侵略朝鲜，和大常委会一面致电朝鲜人民，表示声援，一面号召全世界和平拥护者更加积极地扩大和平签名运动。签名运动从此更进一步地高涨了。到七月下旬，全世界参加签名者已达二亿五千万人。这一签名运动，已经大大地扩大了而且还在扩大着和平拥护者的队伍，揭露了战争贩子指望利用原子弹的吃人生番的丑恶嘴脸，从而使它们更加陷于孤立。
    现在，全世界人民正以扩大签名来迎接定于十月中旬在华沙举行的第二次世界和平大会。可以预料，这次世界和平大会必将获得更重大的成就，把保卫世界和平的运动推向更高的阶段。
