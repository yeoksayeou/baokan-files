Jin County Cotton Fields Promise a Bumper Harvest
    Jiao Yufeng

    On the train from Shijiazhuang to Dezhou, looking out the window, the endless green cotton fields on both sides of the railway are filled with farmers busily pruning and topping the plants, working diligently under the hot sun; white straw hats appear and disappear intermittently. The cotton seedlings are already taller than the knee, and are universally flowering and bearing bolls, a lovely and vibrant sight. Listening to the farmers in the fields tending to the cotton, in just over thirty days, cotton bolls like snow eggs will be continuously carried back to the farmers' homes in baskets and sacks.

    Jin County, close to the Shide Road, is one of the specialty cotton-producing counties in the Shijiazhuang Prefecture of Hebei Province. The county has two hundred and fourteen administrative villages, a population of two hundred and thirty thousand, and a total of seven hundred and seventy-four thousand six hundred acres of arable land, both irrigated and dry. The climate and soil are suitable for growing cotton. This spring, two hundred and ninety-six thousand three hundred and forty acres were planted with cotton, accounting for more than thirty-eight percent of the county's total arable land. After several months of hard work by the cotton farmers, the strong and vigorous cotton seedlings have grown to be more than two feet tall, with abundant flowers and bolls swaying in the wind, presenting a scene of a promising harvest. According to the farmers in the fields, in just over thirty days, the snow-white cotton bolls will be continuously carried back to the farmers' homes in baskets and sacks.

    To grow more cotton and increase industrial raw materials, the Jin County People's Government and the County Party Committee put forward the slogan "Apply more fertilizer, plant less wheat, leave land for cotton planting" as early as last autumn when planting wheat. This spring, in addition to lending a large amount of funds and cotton seeds, they also mobilized a total of three hundred and twenty-seven county and district cadres and students from the county normal school to mobilize and organize the masses to plant cotton.

    In leading cotton planting, it was found that farmers had concerns about planting too much cotton, fearing shortages of food, fuel, and grass for livestock, as well as low cotton prices, which seriously hindered the completion of the large-scale cotton planting task. Therefore, mass meetings of various forms were widely held in various districts and villages throughout the county to publicize and explain the people's government's cotton price policy: "The price of one jin of standard lint cotton should not be lower than the price of eight to ten jin of millet"; explaining that the whole country is now unified, and food and fuel can be transferred in a timely manner, so as long as the cotton harvest is good, there is no need to worry about food and grass; at the same time, using accounting methods, the farmers were told about the great benefits of planting cotton compared to planting other ordinary grains. In Qidi Village, Sixth District, the contrast between the lives of households that profited from cotton planting last year and those that did not plant cotton or planted less cotton played a significant role in dispelling the masses' concerns. Li Lianchen in the village, with twenty-three acres of land and a family of four, planted seventeen acres of cotton last year, with an income of 250 jin of millet per acre, and life became richer day by day. He used the money from selling cotton to buy a mule with others, dug a new well, built two new houses, and also bought four hundred jin of fine fertilizer. Liu Luojun, with twelve acres of land and a family of three, did not plant a single cotton plant last year, and life not only did not develop, but also had some difficulties this spring. At the village's mass meeting, he and Li Lianchen were mobilized to report the above facts, which promoted the smooth completion of the cotton planting task in the whole village.

    After the masses' ideological concerns were eliminated, labor mutual aid organizations were widely mobilized to be established under the principle of voluntary equivalence to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power. According to statistics from twelve villages in the former Fifth District alone, two hundred and ninety-three temporary cotton planting mutual aid groups were organized, with eight hundred and fourteen households and nine hundred and seventy-three people. Because of the lack of livestock, Xiaoqiao Town also organized fifty teams of people pulling plows, and in four days, they planted three thousand three hundred and twenty-nine acres of cotton, successfully completing the task.

    The tender green cotton seedlings emerged from the soil. After weeding, thinning, and setting the seedlings, the cotton seedlings grew exceptionally quickly. However, when the cotton seedlings grew to be more than half a foot tall, cotton aphids occurred in most of the cotton fields, lightly causing them to become a sticky mass, and severely nearly withering. If effective control measures were not taken as soon as possible, not only would the plan to increase cotton production be completely frustrated, but it would also directly and seriously threaten the lives of the people of the whole county. In view of this, the county leaders immediately organized forces to mobilize the masses to control and introduced scientific insect control techniques and insecticides.

    The masses did not have the habit of controlling cotton aphids, let alone the technology of controlling aphids, and lacked confidence in controlling aphids at the beginning. There were also erroneous sayings such as "One spray of 'small oil' (aphids are also called oil drought) is worth a round of fertilizer," and "Saving up a fistful of 'small hours' (cotton leaves curled up due to aphid damage) is worth two years." Some also did not believe in the effectiveness of the medicine, which led to a very slow start to the aphid control movement. The cadres who went to the countryside to lead the control of aphids adopted key experiments, starting with the cotton fields of cadres and party members, using practical examples to promote the scientific technology of aphid control, and quickly eliminated the aphids and protected the cotton seedlings.

    The aphids were wiped out, and the damaged cotton seedlings returned to normal development. The general cotton fields have been hoeed five or six times, and will continue to be hoeed. After the next rain, they will be hoeed again, and the cotton seedlings will grow vigorously. Now the cotton plants, which are more than two feet tall, are universally flowering and bearing bolls. At the same time, the leadership has also organized the masses to study and disseminate the technology and experience of pruning and topping. The pruning and topping movement is unfolding throughout the county. According to experienced old farmers, every fifteen to twenty cotton plants can yield one jin of seed cotton. Calculated at two thousand five hundred to three thousand plants per acre, an average of one hundred and eighty jin of cotton can be picked per acre of irrigated land, and one hundred and twenty jin per acre of dry land, and the county can produce a total of forty-two million jin of seed cotton. Further calculated at three jin of seed cotton yielding one jin of lint cotton, and one jin of lint cotton equaling eight jin of millet, then the total is equivalent to one hundred and twelve million jin of millet. Barring other accidents, this will be a welcome harvest.

    The symbol of a bumper cotton harvest has brought unlimited joy to the cotton farmers. Everywhere in the streets and alleys people are talking about the good cotton harvest that is coming. The farmers who are pruning, when they leave work in the evening, stand on the edge of the field with a pipe in their mouths, looking at the fruits of their labor with smiling faces, the strong and lovely cotton, and there is unspeakable joy.

    Faced with the cotton that promises a bumper harvest, the masses' enthusiasm for production has also been further improved. Some have combined topdressing with weeding. Many villages have launched a manure-collecting and composting movement in the gaps between farm work.

    The cotton is growing well, but there are still some days before the harvest. Do not relax the management of cotton due to excessive optimism. Pay attention to possible disasters at any time and further increase the yield of cotton. Red spiders have now been found in the cotton seedlings in the Third and Fourth Districts. They should be thoroughly eliminated like aphids, so as not to spread and become a disaster, affecting the harvest that is about to be obtained.

　　可望丰收的晋县棉田
    焦玉峰
    在石家庄至德州的火车上，从车窗口向外望去，铁路两侧碧绿无垠的棉田里，紧张进行整枝打杈的农民们，在火热的太阳下，辛勤地劳作着；白色的草帽时现时隐。棉苗高已过膝，正普遍开花结桃，鲜艳可爱。
    紧靠石德路的晋县，是河北省石家庄专区的特产棉县份之一。全县二百一十四个行政村，二十三万人口，可耕水旱地共七十七万四千六百余亩。气候和土质都适于种棉。今春种棉二十九万六千三百四十亩，占全县总耕地面积的百分之三十八强。经过棉农们几个月的辛勤劳作，壮旺的棉苗，已长有二尺多高，花桃累累，迎风摇摆，呈现了一片丰收景象。听在地里整棉的农民们谈，再有三十多天，雪蛋似的棉朵，将一篮子、一口袋地陆续运回农民的家里。
      ×      ×      ×
    为多种棉花，增产工业原料，晋县人民政府和中共县委，早在去年秋后种麦时，即提出了：“多施肥、少种麦，留下土地种棉花”的口号。今年春天，除贷放了大量的款项及棉种外，又动员了全县县区干部和县师范学校的学生共三百二十七人，动员和组织群众进行植棉。
    在领导植棉中，发现农民有怕种棉多了，缺吃、缺烧、缺草喂牲口及怕棉价低等顾虑，严重地障碍了大量种棉任务的完成。于是，在全县各区村，普遍召开了各种形式的群众会议，宣传解释人民政府的棉价政策：“一斤标准皮棉的价格，不低于八斤至十斤小米的价格”；说明现在全国已经统一，吃的、烧的都能及时调运，只要棉花收得好，就不愁粮草；同时用算账方式，给农民们讲明种棉比种其他普通粮食利大的好处。六区祁底村，利用去年种棉获利户和未种棉或种棉少的户生活的对比，对解除群众的顾虑起了很大的作用。该村李连臣，二十三亩地，四口人，去年种棉十七亩，每亩收入合米二百五十斤，日子一天比一天富足。用卖棉的钱，与别人伙买了一头骡子，自己打了一眼新井，盖了两间新房，还买下四百斤细肥。刘洛俊种十二亩地，三口人，去年一棵棉花也没有种，日子不但没有发展，且今春的生活还有些困难。在全村的群众大会上，动员他二人将以上事实作了报告，推动全村顺利完成了植棉任务。
    群众思想顾虑消除后，在自愿等价原则下，广泛动员群众建立劳动互助组织，以解决劳畜力不足的困难。仅据原五区十二个村的统计，便组织了临时性的植棉互助组二百九十三个，八百一十四户，九百七十三人。小樵镇因牲口缺乏，还组织了人拉耧五十犋，四天时间，播种棉花三千三百二十九亩，胜利完成了任务。

    嫩绿的棉苗出土了。经过锄草、间苗、定苗后，棉苗生长异常迅速。但是，在棉苗长到半尺多高的时候，大部棉田发生了棉蚜，轻者腻成一团，重者几近枯萎，如不及早作有效除治，不仅增产棉花的计划将完全落空，且将直接地严重威胁到全县人民的生活问题。县领导上有鉴于此，立即组织力量，动员群众除治，并介绍了科学的除虫技术和杀虫药剂。
    群众没有治棉蚜的习惯，更没有治蚜虫的技术，对治蚜开始时缺乏信心。并有“小时油（蚜虫又叫油旱）一喷，顶上一茬粪”，“小时攒攒拳（棉叶因蚜害而卷成一团），一年顶二年”等的错误说法。还有的不相信药剂的效力，致治蚜运动初期开展很慢。下乡领导治蚜的干部，采取重点试验，先从干部、党员的棉田作起，用实际的例子，推广治蚜的科学技术，迅速消灭了蚜虫，保住了棉苗。

    蚜虫被扑灭了，被害的棉苗又恢复了正常的发育。一般的棉田都锄过了五、六遍，将继续锄耘，下一次雨，就要锄一次，棉苗就生长得旺盛。现在二尺多高的棉棵上，普遍开花结桃。同时领导上又组织群众研究传播了打杈整枝的技术和经验。整枝打杈运动，正在全县各地展开。据有经验的老农谈，每十五棵至二十棵棉花可摘籽棉一斤，按每亩二千五百至三千棵计算，平均每亩水地可摘花一百八十斤，旱地一百二十斤，全县可产籽棉四千二百万斤。再按三斤籽棉出一斤皮棉，一斤皮棉合八斤小米计算，则总合小米一亿一千二百万斤。如无其他意外，这将是一个可喜的丰收。
    棉花丰收的象征，给棉农们带来了无限的忻喜。街头巷尾到处谈论着棉花将有一个好收成。整枝的农民，傍晚下工时，嘴里噙着烟袋，站在地头上，满面笑容地看着自己劳动的结晶，茁壮可爱的棉花，有着说不出的喜欢。
    面对着丰收有望的棉花，群众生产情绪也更为提高，有的在锄苗中结合上了追肥。很多村在农事间隙掀起了?草沤粪运动。

    棉花长得不错，但是离收获还有些日子，切不要因过分乐观而放松了对棉花的管理工作，随时注意可能发生的灾害，进一步提高棉花的产量。现三、四区的棉苗已发现了红蜘蛛，应像对付蚜虫一样，予以彻底消灭，不使其蔓延成灾，影响快要到手的收成。
