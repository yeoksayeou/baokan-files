Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 7th. The People's Liberation Army's East China Military Region and the Third Field Army's air defense forces have valiantly guarded the motherland's airspace over the East China mainland and sea. According to preliminary statistics, they have engaged in over 80 air battles in the past year, shooting down five and damaging twelve various types of American-made Kuomintang bandit planes.

This young air defense force has demonstrated the PLA's heroic, courageous, resourceful, and tenacious fighting style in every battle. During an air battle on Jintang Island in eastern Zhejiang, enemy bombs rained down around the anti-aircraft gun positions, with flashes of light and clouds of dust filling the air. Xie Wenyu, a Communist Party member and gunner of the 8th Company of a certain unit, loaded shells while shouting, "Bombs can't scare us! Our time to be tested has arrived! We must resolutely shoot it down!" When a delayed-action bomb dropped by the enemy landed hissing on the anti-aircraft gun position, the commanders and fighters quickly disassembled the gun and carried it away from the position separately. Gunners Zhang Yuwu and Huo Yongzhen also retrieved all the shells next to the bomb. The gunners reassembled the anti-aircraft gun and continued firing. Before long, a "B-25" type enemy plane was hit and fell into the sea, trailing thick smoke.

Each act of brutality by enemy planes bombing peaceful city residents enraged the commanders and fighters of the air defense forces. During the enemy's several brutal bombings of Shanghai, the commanders and fighters were deeply saddened to see factories, warehouses, and houses destroyed, and the bodies of women and children and displaced victims. They were all filled with anger and shed tears. They wrote resolutions one after another, determined to avenge the people. The soldiers of a certain unit picked up some rubble and bomb fragments and displayed them in their squad, with the words "Our motherland's property has been burned, our parents and brothers have been killed. To avenge this unbearable hatred, we must step up our learning and fight bravely." The combatants, filled with hatred for the enemy, finally shot down an incoming "B-24" enemy plane one night. Citizens wrote letters to express their sympathy and appreciation. One citizen even picked up a piece of wreckage from the enemy plane, wrapped it in cloth, and sent it to the soldiers to express their gratitude.

　　华东暨三野防空部队一年来战绩
    击落击伤美制匪机十七架
    【新华社南京七日电】人民解放军华东军区和第三野战军的防空部队在华东大陆和海面上英勇警卫祖国的领空，据初步统计，一年来共对空作战八十余次，击落各型美制国民党匪帮的飞机五架，击伤十二架。
    这支年青的防空部队在每次作战中，都表现了人民解放军英勇果敢，机智顽强的战斗作风。在浙东金塘岛上的一次对空作战中，敌机的炸弹纷纷落在高射炮阵地周围，火光闪闪，尘土冲天。某部八连炮手共产党员谢文玉一面装炮弹一面喊着：“炸弹吓不倒我们，考验我们的时候到了，坚决把它打下来！”当敌机掷下的一颗延期炸弹嘶嘶地落在高射炮阵地上时，指战员们迅速拆卸炮身，分别抬着离开了阵地。炮手张玉武、霍永贞又在炸弹旁边抢出了全部炮弹。炮手们重新把高射炮安装起来，继续射击。没多久，一架“Ｂ二五”型的敌机便被击中，卷着浓烟落到海里去了。
    敌机对和平城市居民轰炸的每一次暴行都激怒着防空部队的指战员们。在敌机对上海的几次残酷的轰炸中，指战员们沉痛地看到了工厂、仓库和房屋的被炸毁，看到妇女幼孩的尸体和流离失所的灾民之后，都气愤得流下泪来。他们纷纷写下为人民复仇的决心书。某部战士们拾了几块瓦砾和炸弹碎片陈列在自己班内，旁边写着：“我们祖国的财产被烧毁，我们的父母兄弟被杀死，要报戴天之仇就要加紧学习，勇敢作战。”充满着对敌仇恨的战斗员们终于在一个夜晚，把来袭的一架“Ｂ二四”的敌机击落了。市民们都纷纷写信慰问他们。有一个市民还拾了一块敌机的残片，包上布送给战士们，表示感激。
