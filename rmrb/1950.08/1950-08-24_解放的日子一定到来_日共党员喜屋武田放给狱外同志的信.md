　　The Day of Liberation Will Surely Arrive
　　Letter from Japanese Communist Party Member Kiyabu Takehiro to Comrades Outside Prison
　　Editor's Note: The US-Japanese reactionaries are using every possible means to persecute the vanguard of the Japanese people—the Japanese Communist Party. They have unscrupulously fabricated a series of incidents as pretexts for outlawing the JCP. The "Mitaka Incident" is one such conspiracy. The "Mitaka Incident" occurred on July 15th of last year. That evening, a driverless train crashed into Mitaka Station in the suburbs of Tokyo, killing and injuring a dozen people. The reactionary authorities falsely claimed that this was done by the JCP and arrested many JCP members. The following is a letter from Kiyabu Takehiro, one of the JCP members arrested at the time, to his comrades outside the prison after being sentenced to death. From this letter, one can see the staunch and unyielding spirit of the Japanese Communists in their struggle against the reactionaries. The full text of the original letter is as follows:
　　Yesterday, in the fifty-first trial, Comrades Iida, Takeuchi, and I were sentenced to "death," while Comrades Toyama and Yokoya were sentenced to "life imprisonment." Katsuta Seiji, the executioner of our country's working class, finally wants to threaten our young lives with the death penalty. At a time when the reactionaries are preparing for war and rapidly exposing their persecution of our Party, this verdict clearly demonstrates its class nature and colonial essence. Those war criminals who deprived tens of millions of lives in the cruel war have mostly been exempted from the death penalty, but we, who are fighting to protect the freedom and livelihood of the people and to win the independence of our country, will be sent to the gallows because we are Communists. This is the reality!
　　My fellow inmate next door to my solitary cell told me: "If ordinary people were in your situation, they would be scared out of their minds." But we believe that no matter how difficult the times, the Japanese Communist Party will take root among the masses and continue to fight tenaciously. At the same time, the world's proletariat will never ignore the struggle of patriots in Japan just because Japan has become a stepping stone for the reactionaries. History will prove that those buried in the grave will be the traitors themselves. No matter when, we will be supported by the masses, and the day of liberation will surely come.
　　Therefore, the fighting spirit of Comrades Toyama, Yokoya, Shimizu, and Tashiro is quite fierce, which greatly surprised the prison guards. Since "May 30th," many comrades have been detained in Kosuge Prison, encouraging each other. The prison is indeed a place for the initial training of revolutionaries. Now that we are in prison, we must especially consolidate our belief in the revolution, fight against the dangerous tendency of opportunism due to underestimating the strength of the international and domestic people, and never forget our trust in the Party Central Committee.
　　Comrades outside the prison! Please do not worry about us. Fight bravely! This is our only request to you. I firmly believe that although our leading comrades have been forced to withdraw, our Party is still steadily rebuilding, which further strengthens our confidence.

### 解放的日子一定到来  日共党员喜屋武田放给狱外同志的信

　　解放的日子一定到来
    日共党员喜屋武田放给狱外同志的信
    编者按：美日反动派用千方百计对日本人民的前卫——日本共产党实行迫害。他们不择手段制造过一连串事件，作为使日共非法化的借口，“三鹰事件”就是这种阴谋之一。“三鹰事件”发生于去年七月十五日，当晚在东京近郊三鹰车站有一辆无人驾驶的电车撞入车站，致死伤十数人。反动当局诬称这是日共所为，把日共党员多名抓去。下面是当时被捕的日共党员之一喜屋武田放在被判处死刑后，给狱外同志的信。从这信中，可以看到日本共产党员与反动派斗争的坚贞不屈精神。原信全文如下：
    昨天在第五十一次审讯中，饭田、竹内两同志和我被判“死刑”，外山、横谷两同志被判“无期徒刑”，我国劳动阶级的刽子手胜田成治，终于要用极刑来威胁我们年青的生命。当目前反动派为准备战争，急速地暴露了对我党进行迫害之际，从这一判决更足以明显地看出其阶级性与殖民地化的本质。那些在残酷的战争中剥夺了几千万人生命的战争罪犯们，多数已被免去了死刑，可是为了保护人民的自由与生活、争取祖国的独立而进行斗争的我们，却都因为是共产党员的原故，将被凶狠的送往绞架。这就是现实！
    我的单人监房隔邻的难友对我说：“普通的人要是到你这种地步，就会吓得发疯。”但我们相信：日本共产党无论到如何苦难的时期，也会在群众中扎下根基、坚强不拔的继续斗争下去；同时，全世界无产阶级也绝不会因为日本沦为反动派垫脚石而漠视日本国内爱国者的斗争。历史一定会证明，被投入坟墓的人必将是卖国贼自己。无论什么时候，我们都会受到群众的拥护，解放的日子，一定要到来。
    所以，外山、横谷、清水、田代诸同志的斗志都相当炽烈，狱吏们也为此十分惊异。“五·三○”以来，许多同志被拘禁在小菅监狱里，大家互相勉励着，监狱确是革命家的初步锻炼的场所。现在我们在狱中，特别要巩固对革命的信念、要对那一种由于低估国际、国内人民力量而陷入机会主义的危险倾向作斗争，并且要时刻不忘对党中央的信赖。
    狱外的同志们啊！请不要牵挂我们。英勇地斗争吧！我们对你们只有这一个要求。我坚决相信：我们领导同志们虽然被迫退出，然而我党仍在稳固地重建中，这一点更使我们加强信心。
