Overcoming One-Sidedness in News Reporting
　　Chen Kehan

　　The basic task of news reporting is to faithfully reflect objective things, reveal their development laws, and guide people to work in the right direction. In the people's democratic New China, the responsibility of news workers lies in correctly reflecting and guiding the arduous revolutionary struggle and construction work of the people, and promoting our motherland to move forward non-stop.

　　News can only provide correct and practical guidance if it truly reflects the objective reality. If our reports are one-sided and deviate from the facts, it will lead readers to incorrect judgments and may even harm the people's cause. Therefore, news must be truthful, must truly conform to the original appearance of things, and must never be distorted or exaggerated.

　　Generally, objective things are very complex, and there are contradictions within them, with both old and new factors, both rational and irrational aspects, both favorable and unfavorable conditions for the people's cause. These factors are interconnected and mutually influential. At the same time, although objective things are a unity of contradictions, they themselves contain major and minor factors. We should grasp this inherent contradiction of things, distinguish between its main and secondary aspects, and make comprehensive and analytical reports, instead of listing phenomena without distinguishing between primary and secondary, or exaggerating one aspect and obliterating the other, resulting in one-sided reporting.

　　In our newspapers, the phenomenon of fabricating and inventing out of thin air has been basically eliminated. However, that kind of one-sided news still appears in the newspapers from time to time; and although readers are dissatisfied with this kind of one-sided reporting, it has not aroused enough vigilance among our news workers. This kind of one-sided reporting often reports the achievements of the work, but does not report the shortcomings, does not explain the current problems and the areas that still need effort. For example, in reporting on water conservancy construction, we once reported on the huge scale of repairing dikes and embankments, mobilizing a large number of laborers, spending countless materials, and building very long dams, etc. These are all facts and should be publicized; but sometimes, when certain places have already discovered that the construction project lacks strict planning and that there are phenomena such as shoddy workmanship and perfunctory behavior, there is often little or almost no exposure at the time, until the flood comes and some newly built dams collapse, then we start reporting that there are problems with certain projects. For another example, this spring, the Central People's Government implemented many new financial and economic measures, which unified the national finance and economy, brought revenue and expenditure closer to balance, stabilized prices, and the financial and economic situation began to improve. The newspapers gave enthusiastic publicity to the achievements and gains in this work, which was completely correct, because this was a good phenomenon that had not been seen in China for decades and was a huge achievement of the government and the people; however, at that time, some reports lacked adequate explanation of the fact that the national financial and economic situation still had great difficulties, that the conditions for fundamental improvement remained to be created, and that some temporary side effects occurred in the implementation of progressive financial and economic measures, which caused some people to have blindly optimistic emotions, while others expressed that they could not accept individual problems in the propaganda. From the above two specific examples, we can see the one-sidedness of some of our news workers in their work.

　　It is very clear that one-sided news reporting will hinder the connection between the newspaper and the masses. Because the newspaper can only maintain close contact with the people when it truly reflects the life and struggle of the people, guides them to struggle with difficulties, and moves forward on the correct path. Overcoming the one-sidedness of news reporting, so that our news correctly reflects the overall situation, is one of the important conditions for strengthening the connection between the newspaper and the people.

　　Stalin said in "Lenin and the Problem of the United Middle Peasants":

　　"I would also like to take this opportunity to point out that our publications do not always abide by this rule (referring to the rule of struggle on two fronts – Chen’s note), and sometimes show some one-sided attitude. For example, sometimes they expose those who want to turn the temporary extraordinary measures in grain procurement into a regular policy of ours, thus creating a threat to our worker-peasant alliance. Such exposure is very good. But what is not good and not right is that at the same time there is not enough attention, not enough exposure of those who threaten the worker-peasant alliance from the other side, those who succumb to the spontaneous forces of the petty bourgeoisie, demanding to weaken the struggle against rural capitalism, demanding to stipulate complete freedom of trade, making it free from state regulation, thus destroying the worker-peasant alliance from the other end. This is not good, this is a one-sided attitude.

　　Sometimes, they expose those who think that—for example—it is impossible or inappropriate to revitalize the individual small- and middle-peasant economy, which is still the agricultural base at the present stage. Such exposure is very good. But what is not good and not right is that at the same time there is no exposure of those who neglect the significance of collective farms and Soviet farms, who do not understand that at the present time, in addition to revitalizing the individual small- and middle-peasant economy, it is also necessary to earnestly develop the construction of collective farms and Soviet farms. This is a one-sided attitude. In order to ensure the correct line, it is necessary to struggle on two fronts, abandoning any one-sided attitude."

　　Stalin's words were written during the period when the Soviet Union entered the stage of socialist economic construction, and the examples cited were Soviet affairs at that time. China is now in the stage of new democratic revolution and construction, the current enemies are imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and the task is to strive for a fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation. The issue of strengthening the struggle against rural capitalism and building collective farms and Soviet farms is not yet occurring. However, Stalin's opinion that the press should adhere to the struggle on two fronts and oppose a one-sided attitude is right on the mark with the current malady of our newspapers, and we should understand it well.

　　Why does one-sided news appear in our newspapers, and what effective measures should be taken to eliminate it? We know that the causes of an accident are often multifaceted. The ideological style of our journalists is not yet fully sound, and there are some incorrect understandings about news reporting, the interview is not in-depth, and there is a lack of analysis and research on things, which is the root cause of one-sided news reporting; and some organizations and some people, consciously or unconsciously, provide one-sided information to newspapers and journalists, reporting good news but not bad news, or reporting bad news but not good news, which cannot but bear a great responsibility. However, the newspaper is in the hands of journalists, as long as the journalist's mind is clear, the interview is in-depth, and there is a correct analysis and judgment of various situations, many malpractices can be eliminated. Therefore, eliminating one-sided reporting must first rely on the efforts of journalists. We must demand more from journalists.

　　It must be pointed out that the working attitude and working style of some of our journalists have not yet been fully on track. Some people vaguely have such a concept: Why must we expose the shortcomings in the actual work in the newspaper? I was warmly entertained by a certain organization or a certain person when I interviewed them, and they provided me with a lot of materials, so I should be "lenient" in my writing, otherwise it will not be easy to interview them a second time. Therefore, when writing news, they intentionally or unintentionally bring a one-sided attitude. Precisely because this kind of wrong thinking exists, when it is proposed that the newspaper should strengthen criticism and self-criticism, many journalists have asked the superiors for support. Yes, support is completely necessary. The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's public announcement of the decision to carry out criticism and self-criticism is a strong support. But the problem is not here, the problem is first of all how the journalist understands this matter. The journalist of the people's newspaper must have the courage to adhere to the truth and oppose mistakes. If the matter itself is good, it should be said to be good; if it is bad, it should be said to be bad; if it is good and bad, it should be said to be good and bad. Right and wrong, black and white, must be clear without any discrepancy. What he should first consider is: Whether the news I have interviewed is true and comprehensive, and what the advantages and disadvantages of publishing it are for the people. If the news itself is true and comprehensive, and it is estimated that publishing it is beneficial to the people or more beneficial than harmful, then he should resolutely strive to publish it in the newspaper regardless of the opposition and obstruction of certain individuals. If the news itself is unreliable or has great one-sidedness, and it is estimated that publishing it is unfavorable to the people or more harmful than beneficial, then even if certain individuals urgently request to publish it, he should resolutely refuse it. Sometimes, in order to protect the interests of the people, some facts should be retained without harming the principle of the authenticity of the news; or even the news should not be published temporarily. But in this case, its starting point should be for the benefit of the people, and should never be to cater to the selfish desires of certain individuals. News reporting should be subordinate to and serve the interests of the people, this is the principle that we must abide by.

　　Now, many newspapers, news agencies, and journalists have reporting policies and plans in their work. In order to correctly reflect the situation, newspapers, news agencies, and journalists, according to the actual work situation, formulate certain reporting policies and plans in advance at various periods, as their own direction and goal of effort, in order to carry out reporting in a planned way according to this policy and plan, and overcome blindness and dispersion in the work, which is necessary. However, this reporting policy and reporting plan must also be tested in the process of actual interview activities. If our investigation and research results prove that the reporting policy or reporting plan originally formulated is wrong and does not conform to reality, or the actual situation has undergone new changes, then we should change our reporting policy and reporting plan in a timely manner, and conduct reporting in a realistic manner based on the actual situation; and we should never distort objective facts to cater to the original reporting policy or reporting plan. Otherwise, news reporting will not be a correct reflection of objective things, but will become something containing many subjective prejudices. On this issue, the understanding of some journalists is not yet clear. They have idolized the reporting policy and reporting plan, thinking that whatever the superiors want, they will give it, so there will always be no mistakes, and they can get more opportunities to publish. As a result, when the editorial department formulates a reporting policy or reporting plan, the journalists go to fight for the realization of the policy and plan, and strive to find materials that are compatible with the reporting policy and plan. Sometimes they find that the actual situation does not conform to the plan and policy, or the situation is much more complicated than expected, so they would rather simplify it, abandon many real materials, and only choose a part or an aspect that suits the taste of the superiors. This situation must be resolutely corrected. From here, we can also see that if the editorial department works behind closed doors, does not widely contact the outside world, does not listen to the reports of journalists and correspondents on the objective situation, so that their ears and eyes are blocked and their thinking is not broad, it is impossible to correctly grasp the direction of propaganda and guide journalists and correspondents to conduct comprehensive reporting, and their work will often fall into a passive and difficult position. Therefore, to eliminate one-sided news, we must promote materialism from top to bottom within all news organizations, oppose idealism, promote boldly facing reality, and oppose blind catering psychology. The editorial department and journalists should fully cultivate political sensitivity, have the greatest interest in all new things, try their best to understand and study the new situation of revolutionary struggle and construction work, and be good at organizing their own news reporting according to the changed new situation, in order to raise many new questions to readers and the editorial department.

　　The effective way to eliminate the one-sidedness of news reporting is to carry out in-depth investigation and research work. Only by making up your mind to do patient and arduous investigation and research work, and asking around in many ways when encountering a matter, will the things you write be correct. If you easily believe one-sided words and do not spend some effort to investigate, it is inevitable to be deceived. In our team, there are still some people who like to boast about their achievements and are good at complaining. When talking about his work, he will only talk about achievements and not shortcomings. In order to ask the superiors for people and things, he can exaggerate difficulties and not mention favorable conditions. If journalists are used by them, the news they write will definitely be biased. Therefore, journalists should conduct investigations up and down, left and right, before and after, and in all directions when interviewing news. If you visit a factory, don't just sit in the director's office, you also have to talk to the workers and technicians. Even so, it does not mean that you have clarified the matter. Because it is very likely that what you have investigated is the surface phenomenon, and it is very likely that there are also problems with whether what the interviewee said is comprehensive and accurate. Therefore, you must also use your own brains and think carefully to analyze and research, and then make a judgment. If you find doubts during the research, you must conduct further investigation until you clarify the truth. Only by repeatedly investigating and researching in this way, collecting sufficient materials, and grasping the essence of things from these materials, not only raising questions, but also understanding the direction of solving problems, can you write meaningful, powerful, and comprehensive news. It can be seen that it is not easy to write a good news report, it requires a lot of hard work! Attempting to take shortcuts and talk to one or two people, piling up many messy materials together, and calling it a news communication, will never succeed.

　　In short, to overcome the one-sidedness of news reporting and make our news truly conform to the true and comprehensive situation of objective things, our journalists must establish a materialist viewpoint, adopt a realistic attitude, carry out patient and arduous work, and engage in multi-faceted and in-depth investigation and research.

　　克服新闻报道的片面性
　　陈克寒
    新闻报道的基本任务，是忠实地反映客观事物，揭明它的发展规律，引导人们向正确的方向努力。在人民民主的新中国，新闻工作者的责任，就在于正确地反映和指导人民群众的艰巨的革命斗争和建设工作，推动我们的祖国一息不停地前进。
    新闻，只有真正反映了客观的真实情况，才能进行正确的切合实际的指导。如果我们的报道是片面的，与事实有出入的，那么就会使读者得到一种不正确的判断，甚至可能使人民事业受到损害。所以，新闻必须真实，必须真正符合事物的本来面目，而决不允许歪曲或夸大。
    一般客观事物都是很复杂的，它们的内部存在着矛盾的，有旧的因素又有新的因素，有合理的方面又有不合理的方面，对于人民事业有有利条件又有不利条件，这些因素相互联系，相互影响。同时，客观事物虽是矛盾的统一体，但它本身又包含着主要的因素和次要的因素。我们应当把握事物的这种内在的矛盾，区分它的主要方面和次要方面，作全面的有分析的报道，而不可不分主从，罗列现象，或夸大一面，抹煞另一面，进行片面性的报道。
    在我们的新闻纸中，向壁虚构、凭空捏造的现象，是已经基本上被消灭了。但那种片面性的新闻，却不时在报纸上出现；而且，尽管读者不满意这种片面性的报道，却并未引起我们新闻工作者的足够警惕。这种片面性的报道，往往报道了工作的成绩，而不报道缺点，不说明目前存在的问题以及尚待努力的地方。例如，在报道水利建设中，我们曾经报道了修堤复埝的巨大规模，动员了大量民工，花费了无数器材，筑成了很长的堤坝，等等，这些都是事实，是应该宣传的；但有时某些地方已经发现修建工程缺乏严密计划，发生偷工减料，敷衍塞责等现象，在当时却往往很少或几乎没有任何揭发，一直到大水来临，有些新筑的堤坝溃决，才开始报道某些工程有毛病。又如，今年春天，中央人民政府，实行许多财政经济新措施，使国家财政经济统一，收支接近平衡，物价趋向稳定，财政经济情况开始好转，报纸对于这一工作中的成绩和收获曾予以热烈的宣传，这是完全正确的，因为这是中国近数十年来未有的好现象，是政府和人民的巨大的业绩；但当时有些报道对于国家的财政经济情况仍有很大困难，根本好转的条件尚待创造，在执行财政经济的进步措施中发生了一些暂时的副作用，却缺乏适当的说明，因而曾有一部分人产生盲目的乐观情绪，另一部分人对宣传上的个别问题表示不能接受。从上述这两个具体的事例，可以看到我们有些新闻工作者在工作中的片面性。
    很显然的，片面性的新闻报道，会妨碍报纸和群众的联系。因为报纸只有在它真实地反映人民群众的生活和斗争，引导他们与困难斗争，踏着正确的道路前进的时候，才能与人民群众保持密切的联系。克服新闻报道的片面性，使我们的新闻正确地反映全面情况，正是加强报纸与人民群众联系的重要条件之一。
    斯大林在“列宁与联合中农问题”中说：
    “我还要乘机指出，就是我们的刊物并不常常都遵守这个规则（系指两条战线斗争的规则——陈注），而有时表现出一些片面态度。例如，有时候揭露着那些想把粮食采办方面的临时非常办法变为我们政策的经常方针，因而给我们工农联盟造成一种威胁的人。这样的揭露是很好的。可是不好而且不对的，就是同时却没有充分注意，没有尽量揭露那些从另一方面威胁工农联盟的人，没有揭露那些屈服于小资产阶级自发势力，要求减弱反农村资本主义斗争，要求规定贸易完全自由，使其不受国家调节，因而从另一端来破坏工农联盟的人。这就不好了，这是片面态度。
    有时候，揭露着那些认为——譬如说——不可以，不宜于振兴现今阶段上还是农业基础的个体小农中农经济的人。这样揭露是很好的。可是不好而且不对的，就是同时却没有揭露那些忽视集体农庄和苏维埃农庄的意义，不懂得现时除必须振兴个体小农中农经济之外，还要切实发展集体农庄苏维埃农庄建设事业。这就是片面态度了。为了保证正确路线，就必须在两条战线上进行斗争，抛弃任何片面态度。”
    斯大林这段话是在苏联进入社会主义经济建设时期写的，所举的实例，是苏联当时的事情。中国现在处在新民主主义革命和建设阶段，当前的敌人是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义，任务是争取国家财政经济情况的根本好转，目前还不发生加强反农村资本主义斗争，和建设集体农庄和苏维埃农庄等问题。但是，斯大林所指出的，报刊宣传应坚持两条战线的斗争，反对片面态度的意见，却切中我们报纸的时弊，我们应很好领会。
    为什么我们的报纸上会出现片面性的新闻，应该采取什么有效办法加以消灭呢？我们知道，一件事故的发生，原因往往是多方面的。我们记者的思想作风还不十分健全，对于新闻报道或多或少存在一些不正确的认识，采访不深入，对事情缺乏分析研究，是产生片面性新闻报道的根本原因；而某些机关和某些人们，自觉地或不自觉地向报纸和记者供给片面性的情况，报喜不报忧或报忧不报喜，也不能不负很大责任。但报纸是掌握在记者手里的，只要记者头脑是清醒的，采访深入，对各种情况有正确的分析判断，就可以杜绝许多弊端。因此，消灭片面性报道这件事，首先必须依靠记者的努力。我们必须对记者要求得更多些。
    必须指出：我们有些记者的工作态度和工作作风还没有完全走上轨道。有些人模糊地有这样的观念：何必一定要在报上揭发实际工作中的缺点呢？我向某机关某人采访消息，受到人家殷勤的招待，供给我许多材料，我还是“笔下留情”一些吧，否则第二次就不好去采访了。因此，在写作新闻的时候，就有意无意地带了片面性。正因为存在着这种错误思想，所以，当提出报纸要加强批评和自我批评时，许多记者便纷纷地要求上级给予支持。是的，支持是完全需要的，中国共产党中央公开发表开展批评和自我批评的决定，就是一个强有力的支持。但问题不在这里，问题首先在于记者对于这件事的认识如何。人民报纸的记者，必须具有坚持真理、反对错误的勇气。事情本身是好的，就应该说是好的；坏的，就应该说是坏的；有好有坏，就应该说有好有坏。是非黑白，毫厘不爽。他首先应该考虑到的是：我所采访到的消息是否真实全面，发表出去对人民的利害怎样。如果新闻本身是真实全面的，估计发表了对人民是有利的或利多害少的，就应该不顾某些个人的反对和阻挠，坚决地争取在报上发表。如果新闻本身是不可靠的或有很大的片面性的，估计发表了对人民是不利的或害多利少的，那么即使某些个人多么迫切地要求发表，也应该坚决地加以拒绝。有时，为了保护人民的利益，在不损害新闻的真实性原则下，对于某些事实加以保留；或者甚至暂时不发表该项新闻，也是应该的。但在这种场合，它的出发点应该是为了人民的利益，而决不应是为了适应某些个人的自私的愿望。新闻报道应该服从和服务于人民的利益，这是我们必须遵守的原则。
    现在，许多报纸、通讯社和记者，在工作中，都有报道方针和计划。为了正确地反映情况，报纸、通讯社和记者根据实际工作情况，在各个时期预先制定一定的报道方针和计划，作为自己努力的方向和目标，以便按照这种方针和计划有计划地进行报道，克服工作中的盲目性和散漫性，是必要的。但这种报道方针和报道计划，还必须在实际采访活动的过程中受到考验。如果我们调查研究的结果证明当初制定的报道方针或报道计划是错误的、不合实际的，或者实际情况已经有了新的变化，那么就应该及时地改变自己的报道方针和报道计划，并根据实际情况实事求是地进行报道；而决不应该削足适履，歪曲客观事实，去迎合原定的报道方针或报道计划。否则，新闻报道就会不是客观事物的正确反映，而会成为包含许多主观成见的东西了。在这个问题上，有些记者的认识还不明确。他们把报道方针和报道计划偶像化了，认为上级要什么，就给什么，那样总不会有错，而且可以多得到一些发表的机会。于是，编辑部一个报道方针或报道计划制定下来，记者们就分头去为方针和计划的实现而奋斗，努力寻求与报道方针和计划相适应的材料。有时发现实际情况与计划、方针并不符合，或者情形要比预先设想的复杂得多，他们就宁可舍繁就简，把许多真实材料舍弃不顾，仅仅选择适合于上级胃口的一部分或一个方面写出来。这种情形必须坚决纠正。从这里也可以看到：编辑部要是关门工作，不与外间广泛联系，不倾听记者和通讯员关于客观情况的报告，以致耳目蔽塞，思路不广，就不可能正确地掌握宣传方向，指导记者和通讯员进行全面的报道，就会使自己的工作常常陷于被动的困难地位。因此，要消灭片面性的新闻，就必须在所有新闻机关内部从上到下提倡唯物主义，反对唯心主义，提倡大胆地正视现实，反对盲目的迎合心理。编辑部和记者应该充分地培养政治敏感，对一切新鲜事物发生最大的兴趣，尽力去了解和研究革命斗争和建设工作的新情况，并善于根据变化了的新情况来组织自己的新闻报道，以便向读者和编辑部提出许许多多的新问题。
    消灭新闻报道的片面性的有效办法，是进行深刻的调查研究工作。只有下定决心，做耐心的艰苦的调查研究工作，遇到一件事情，多方面打听打听，写出来的东西才会对头。如果轻信一面之词，不去花些力气考察考察，那就难免上当。在我们的队伍中还不免有一些这样的人，他们喜欢夸耀自己的功绩，也善于叫苦。谈他的工作，会只说成绩，不讲缺点。为了向上级要人要东西，他可以夸张困难，不说有利条件。记者如果被他们利用，写出来的新闻就一定会偏。所以，记者采访新闻，应该上下、左右、前后、四面八方进行调查。如果你访问一个工厂，就不要光在厂长室里坐，还得找工人、技师谈谈才是。即使如此，也并不等于把事情弄清楚了。因为很可能所考察到的是表面现象，很可能被访问者所说的是否全面是否确切也还有问题。所以，还须使用自己的脑子，用心思进行分析研究，然后才下判断。如果在研究的时候发现疑问，就须再作进一步的调查，一直到弄明真象为止。只有这样反复地调查研究，既搜集了充分材料，而又从这些材料中掌握到事物的本质，不仅提出问题，并且了解解决问题的方向，才能写出有意义的有力量的全面性的新闻。可见，真正要写出一篇好新闻不是容易的事，很需要做些艰苦的工作哩！企图偷便取巧，找一两个人一谈，把许多杂乱的材料堆在一起，就算一篇新闻通讯，是永远不会成功的。
    总之，要克服新闻报道的片面性，使我们的新闻真正合乎客观事物的真实的全面的情况，必须我们新闻记者树立唯物观点，采取实事求是的态度，进行耐心的艰苦的工作，从事多方面的深刻的调查研究。
