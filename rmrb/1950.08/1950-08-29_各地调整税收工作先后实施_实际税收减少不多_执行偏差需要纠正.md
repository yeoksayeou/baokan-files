Xinhua News Agency report: The work of tax adjustment has been implemented successively throughout the country.

　　Since the Second National Tax Conference was held in June of this year, local tax bureaus have checked their past work and studied and arranged specific methods for adjusting taxes in accordance with the spirit of the Central People's Government's tax adjustment. Major administrative regions and centrally-administered municipalities and provinces have calculated new budget figures, slightly lower than the original tasks for this year, based on the revised tax rates and categories. The industrial and commercial sectors in various regions have also widely disseminated and prepared for the adjustments. After the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government announced the advance implementation of the adjustment of industrial and commercial taxes on July 1, the work of tax adjustment in various regions successively entered the implementation phase.

    Improving Collection Methods

　　In terms of improving the collection methods for industrial and commercial taxes, various regions have generally adopted the three methods of "self-declaration and accounting for tax calculation according to rates," "democratic appraisal," and "periodic fixed quotas" in July. Due to different work foundations, the scope of adopting the "self-declaration and accounting" method also varies from region to region: The Hebei Provincial Tax Bureau has accumulated some experience in managing industry and commerce, so it stipulates that towns with more than 300 industrial and commercial households can adopt the "self-declaration and accounting" method for industrial and commercial operators with sound accounting. The work foundation in the Southwest region is relatively poor, so it was only decided to selectively adopt the "self-declaration and accounting" method in eight cities: Chongqing, Chengdu, Zigong, Luxian, Wanxian, Nanchong, Guiyang, and Kunming. Local tax bureaus have also strengthened the work of typical investigations when adopting the "democratic appraisal" method of taxation. In the appraisal, it generally goes through several stages such as self-reporting, mutual evaluation, mutual inspection, review, and verification, so that the burden is closer to the tax rate, thereby avoiding the reoccurrence of excessively light or heavy phenomena. Experience in various regions has proven that organizing mutual inspection groups including shop assistants, trade associations, and tax officials to check each other's accounts is a good way to achieve fair burden. When Shanghai began appraising industrial and commercial taxes for March, April, and May and the income calculation part of the industrial and commercial taxes for January and February in July, the appraisal was once hindered because only tasks were assigned and industrial and commercial operators were afraid of unfair burden. Later, the appraisal work was able to proceed smoothly by adopting the method of mutual inspection. In July, when Wuhan appraised industrial and commercial taxes in eleven major industries, mutual inspections were carried out among 299 households, and as a result, 121 households were found to have omitted accounts, thus making the burden more reasonable. In order to make the collection methods for industrial and commercial taxes more sound, various regions have also implemented the organization of industrial and commercial groups and the establishment of a regional responsibility system for tax officials; the Northeast has also begun to establish a unified accounting book and invoice system.

    Adjusting Tax Categories and Tax Rates

　　In terms of adjusting tax categories and tax rates, the adjustment of commodity tax rates and categories has been generally welcomed by the industrial and commercial sectors. Taking cigarettes as an example, the past tax rate was uniformly levied at 120% regardless of the quality of the cigarettes. After the adjustment, the tax rate for lower-grade cigarettes was appropriately reduced, which may improve the sales of lower-grade cigarettes, thereby increasing the enthusiasm of factory owners. After the merger of cotton fabric commodity tax into cotton yarn, the weaving industry and the knitting industry—especially small factories and workshops—have gained a lot of convenience in operation. In the past, small weaving workshops that could only produce one or two pieces of cloth a day had to specially employ people to handle declaration and tax payment procedures. Now, this part of the manpower can be completely used for production.

　　After the tax adjustment, although the budgeted income has been reduced, the actual income has not decreased much due to the improvement of tax collection methods and the strengthening of investigation and research work. This shows that although there were phenomena of excessive or light burdens in the past on industrial and commercial taxes, those with burdens lighter than the tax rate still accounted for the majority.

　　In the tax adjustment, individual tax authorities in some regions still do not have a sufficient understanding of the policies, and therefore deviations occur during implementation. For example, the tax authorities in the Central and Southern region mistakenly believed that "the 'periodic fixed quota' collection method based on democratic appraisal" was a tax package system.

　　In addition, it was also found in the implementation that some provisions in the adjusted tax law are still not appropriate enough. For example, after the transaction tax stipulates "only collected in markets and fairs with brokers," chaos occurred in the grain and livestock markets in Beijing and Tianjin, and merchants successively made transactions outside the market. This not only affects fiscal revenue, but also causes inconvenience to market management. Furthermore, after the temporary business tax stipulates "businesses with a turnover of less than 200,000 yuan are exempt from tax," itinerant merchants often divide large transactions into smaller ones to evade the burden. The General Taxation Bureau is studying solutions to the above problems.

### 各地调整税收工作先后实施  实际税收减少不多  执行偏差需要纠正

　　各地调整税收工作先后实施
    实际税收减少不多
    执行偏差需要纠正
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：全国各地调整税收的工作已先后实施。
    自本年六月间第二届全国税务会议召开以后，各地税务局即按中央人民政府调整税收的精神，纷纷检查了过去的工作，研究与布置了调整税收的具体办法。各大行政区及中央直属省、市并按修正后的税率、税目计算出新的、较本年度原来任务略低的预算数字。各地工商界方面也纷纷进行传达与准备。七月一日中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会公布调整工商税提前实施部分后，各地调整税收的工作即先后进入实施阶段。
    改善征收方式
    在改善工商业税的征收方式方面，七月份各地已普遍同时分别采用“自报查账，依率计征”、“民主评议”、“定期定额”三种方式。由于工作基础不同，各地采用“自报查账”方式的范围也不一致：河北省税务机关在管理工商业方面已经积累了若干经验，所以规定三百户工商业以上的城镇都可以在账目健全的工商业者中采用“自报查账”的征收办法。西南区工作基础较差，所以只决定在重庆、成都、自贡、泸县、万县、南充、贵阳、昆明八个城市中有重点地采用“自报查账”的办法。各地税务局在采用“民主评议”的办法征税时，也都加强了典型调查的工作。在评议中，一般经过自报、互评、互查、复查、核定等几个阶段，使负担比较更接近于税率，从而避免畸轻畸重现象的重新发生。各地经验证明，组织包括店员、同业公会、税务工作人员三方面的互查小组互相查账，是达到负担公平的很好办法。上海市七月份开始评议三、四、五三个月工商业税及一、二两月份工商业税中的所得额计算部分时，由于只分配任务，工商业者怕负担不公，评议一度受到阻碍。后来采取互相查账的办法，评议工作才得以顺利进行。武汉市七月份评议十一个主要行业的工商业税时，在二百九十九户中进行互查，结果查出一百二十一户漏账，因而使负担趋于合理。为了使工商业税的征收方法更加健全，各地并已实行组织工商业小组，建立税务工作人员的分区专责管理制；东北并已开始建立统一账簿与发货票制。
    调整税目税率
    在调整税目、税率方面，货物税税率、税目的调整受到工商界的普遍欢迎。以纸烟为例，过去的税率不分烟级好坏，一律按百分之一百二十征收，调整后适当降低了次级纸烟的税率，使次烟销路可能好转，因而使厂主经营积极性提高。棉织品货物税合并于棉纱中征收后，织布业与针织业——尤其是小型的工厂作坊在经营上已获得很多方便。以往一家每天只能生产一两匹布的小织布工场，得专门用人办理申报完税手续，现在这部分人力即可以完全用到生产上去。
    在调整税收后，预算收入虽已减低，但由于征税方法的改善和调查研究工作的加强，实际收入并未减少很多。这说明过去在工商业税负担上虽有畸重畸轻的现象，但负担轻于税率者还是占多数。
    在调整税收中，个别地区的税务机关还有对政策了解不够的情形，因而在执行时发生偏差。如中南区税务机关误认“以民主评议为基础的‘定期定额’征收方式”为包税制。
    此外，在执行中亦发现调整后的税法中有某些规定还有不够妥当的地方。如交易税规定“只有在有牙纪之市场、集市征收”后，京、津两地的粮食、牲口市场即发生混乱现象，商贩纷纷在场外成交。这不仅影响财政收入，而且引起市场管理的不便。再如临时商业税规定“营业额不满二十万元者免征”后，行商交易多化整为零，逃避负担。上述问题税务总局正研究解决办法中。
