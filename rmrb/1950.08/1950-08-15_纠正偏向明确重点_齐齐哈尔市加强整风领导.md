Correcting Deviations and Clarifying Priorities
Qiqihar City Strengthens Leadership in Rectification Campaign
[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In the rectification study of organizations directly under Qiqihar City, Heilongjiang Province, some major problems have been discovered in conjunction with work inspections. In order to conduct in-depth inspection work, the Qiqihar Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting on July 29 of Party member cadres from organizations directly under the city and state-owned enterprises, as well as the main responsible cadres of provincial and municipal enterprises. At the meeting, Li Zhiwen, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, reported on the situation of Party rectification study and the problems discovered in the past 20 days, and especially pointed out the rectification priorities and future steps of each major department.

In Comrade Li Zhiwen's report, he first pointed out that this rectification study was carried out in conjunction with the current practical work. And most of them adopted the method of combining top-down and bottom-up symposiums to inspect the work. Many units also convened meetings of lower-level cadres to solicit opinions on the leadership's work. The Tax Bureau also convened a forum for industrialists and merchants to solicit opinions widely. Most of the responsible comrades of various departments, with a responsible attitude towards the people, sincerely and humbly considered these opinions, and inspected their work, corrected shortcomings and mistakes according to these opinions. However, some leading comrades initially failed to set an example, and even handed over this work to non-Party cadres to lead, using the excuse of being busy at work and not attending meetings, being strict with others and lenient with themselves at the meetings, which affected the development of the movement. In addition, some cadres at the section chief and staff level believed that Party rectification was a matter for the leadership and had nothing to do with them. Comrade Li Zhiwen criticized these erroneous attitudes and understandings in his report. At the same time, he pointed out that there was also a phenomenon of not linking with reality in studying documents and not seriously inspecting work in accordance with the spirit of the documents, which should be quickly corrected; in inspecting work, some departments did not grasp the central link. Many problems were raised, which distracted energy and blurred the main problems. For example, the Health Bureau raised many problems, but the important issue of how to unite medical staff and strengthen their concept of serving the people was not mentioned. The power plant talked a lot about the relationship between the Party, government, trade union, and the Youth League, but it did not talk about or review the important issue of frequent accidents affecting safe power transmission, or talked about it very little. Then, Comrade Li Zhiwen clarified the rectification priorities according to the problems raised by each department, and analyzed the reasons why the deviations in the work of each department were not revealed and overcome in time: the level of leading comrades is not high, but this is not the main reason. The main reason is that bureaucratic work style has become a bomb shelter for various shortcomings and errors, so that the leadership cannot discover problems and is ignorant of the vivid objective reality, and it is also due to insufficient concern and responsibility for the people. The Municipal Party Committee itself made a preliminary review on the following main issues:

1. The Municipal Party Committee did not tightly grasp the ideological leadership of the cadre policy, and showed a poor understanding, inspection and research of the basic situation of major work. For example, it lacked a systematic understanding and inspection of urban production, supply and marketing, the proportion of public and private production, productivity, and prices. Therefore, it cannot improve the policy and ideological level of cadres with practical examples. 2. There is insufficient spirit of Party principles, and some unprincipled disputes among cadres have not been well and timely corrected. 3. Although there are annual and monthly plans for work, there is a lack of comprehensive consideration and inspection of the degree of implementation, and public production has been grasped while private production and commerce have been relaxed. What should be done in the next step of Party rectification? Comrade Li Zhiwen pointed out that we should grasp the center, continue to conduct in-depth inspection of work, and solve policy issues and work style issues related to the current work.

　　纠正偏向明确重点
    齐齐哈尔市加强整风领导
    【本报讯】黑龙江省齐齐哈尔市直属机关整风学习中，结合检查工作，已发现一些主要问题，现将深入检查工作。为此，中共市委会于七月二十九日召集了直属机关，国营企业党员干部及省市营企业的主要负责干部会议。会上市委书记李治文除报告了二十多天来整党学习情况和检查出的问题外，特别指出了各主要部门的整党重点和今后的步骤。
    李治文同志的报告中首先指出，这次整风学习是结合了当前的实际工作进行的。并且大都采取了自上而下，与自下而上相结合的座谈会的方式检查工作。还有很多单位召集了下一级干部会议，征求对领导工作的意见。税务局并召集了工商业者座谈会，广泛征求意见。各部门的负责同志绝大部分抱着对人民负责的态度，诚恳的虚心的考虑这些意见，并根据这些意见检查工作，改正缺点与错误。但也有部分领导同志开始时不能以身作则，甚至把这一工作交给非党干部去领导，借口工作忙不参加会议，在会议上责人严责己宽，影响了运动的开展。另外有些科长、科员一级的干部，对整党认为是领导上的事与自己无关。李治文同志在报告中批判了这些错误态度与认识。同时指出还有在学习文件中不会联系实际，不能认真根据文件精神检查工作的现象，应迅速纠正；在检查工作上有的部门没抓住中心环节。问题提的很多，分散了精力，模糊了主要问题。如卫生局提的问题很多，但如何团结医务人员加强他们为人民服务观点的重要问题却没有提到。发电厂讲了不少党政工青关系，但对屡次发生事故，影响安全送电这样重要问题，却不谈或检讨得很少。接着李治文同志根据各部门已提出的问题分别明确了整党重点，并分析了各部门工作发生偏向而未得及时揭露克服的原因：领导同志水平不高，但这不是主要的，主要的是官僚主义作风作了各种缺点错误的防空洞，使领导不能发现问题，对生动的客观现实茫无所知，也是对人民的负责关心不够所致。市委本身并就以下主要问题做了初步检讨：
    一、市委对干部政策思想领导抓的不紧，表现对主要工作的基本情况了解检查与研究差。如对城市生产，供销、公私生产比重；生产力、物价等缺乏系统的了解与检查。因而不能以实际的事例提高干部的政策思想水平。二、党内原则精神不够，对干部中某些无原则纠纷等没很好的及时指正。三、工作虽有全年及每月计划，但缺少对执行程度的全面考虑和检查，抓住了公营生产放松了私营生产及商业。整党工作下一步怎么办？李治文同志指出应抓住中心，继续深入检查工作，解决与当前工作有关的政策问题和作风问题。
