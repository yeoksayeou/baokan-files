　　Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, 25th— The Belgian working people, with grief and anger, held a funeral for their late leader, the Chairman of the Belgian Communist Party, Lahaut, on August 22nd. Lahaut's comrades carried his coffin towards the cemetery, and thousands of people participated in the funeral procession. Throughout the Belgian industrial area, from Mons on the Franco-Belgian border to Liège, more than 300,000 workers held a half-hour strike to bid farewell to their leader.
　　Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties from various countries delivered speeches at the funeral. Ochab, the Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, pointed out in his speech: From this barbaric act of the fascists, one can see a particularly vile, deliberate attempt to intimidate fighters for peace and socialism. But this kind of terrorist tactic cannot prove its strength, it can only prove its weakness. The blood of proletarian martyrs is arousing thousands upon thousands of new fighters, making them fight against this dying force of darkness. Lahaut's name has become a battle flag uniting all honest people who cherish human freedom and happiness, and it will not change for generations to come.

　　比人民沉痛安葬拉豪特
    数千人参加送葬行列
    三十万工人罢工致哀
    【新华社二十五日讯】布鲁塞尔消息：八月二十二日，比利时劳动人民怀着沉痛和愤怒的心情，在为他们已故的领袖，比利时共产党主席拉豪特举行葬礼。拉豪特的战友们抬着他的灵榇走向墓地，数千人参加了送葬的行列。整个比利时工业区，从法、比边境的蒙斯到列日，三十多万工人举行了半小时罢工，同自己的领袖告别。
    各国共产党及工人党代表都在葬仪中发表演说。波兰统一工人党书记奥查布在演说中指出：从法西斯分子这种野蛮行动中，可以看出一种特别卑劣，蓄意恫吓和平与社会主义斗士的新企图。但这种恐怖手法不能证明它的力量，只能证明他的软弱。无产阶级烈士的鲜血，正激起千千万万的新斗士，使他们与这垂死的黑暗势力斗争。拉豪特的名字已成为团结一切珍视人类自由幸福的正直人士的战旗，世世代代不会改变。
