Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang: This year, the more than three million mu of rice planted in the Northeast region are growing well and are expected to have a good harvest, thanks to the active cultivation and improved techniques of the farmers.

The rice planting area in Northeast China has been increasing year by year with the strong support of the People's Government. According to incomplete statistics from the five provinces of Songjiang, Jilin, Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe, more than 410,000 mu of new paddy fields have been reclaimed this year. Adding to the original 2.92 million mu (of which nearly 2 million mu were restored or increased within the three years after the liberation of Northeast China), the total rice planting area in the region has reached more than 3.3 million mu this year.

With the increase of farmers' enthusiasm for production, there has also been significant improvement in paddy field cultivation techniques this year. In the main rice-producing areas of Songjiang, Jilin, and Liaodong provinces, farmers in most areas have changed the broadcasting method they used to use in the past and adopted the new planting methods of row planting and spot planting. This not only saves seeds and water and facilitates weeding, but also increases the yield by 20 to 30 percent compared with broadcasting. The promotion of superior rice varieties has also been widely welcomed by farmers. Farmers in Wangqing, Helong, Yanji and other counties of Jilin Province also generally use the method of warm bed seedling cultivation, so that the superior rice varieties with longer growth period can also be suitable for local planting.

　　农民积极耕作改进技术
    东北水稻生长良好
    【新华社沈阳电】东北地区今年播种的三百余万亩水稻，经过农民群众积极耕作和改进技术，目前生长情况良好，可望丰收。
    东北水稻播种面积，在人民政府的大力扶持下，逐年均有增加。今年据松江、吉林、辽东、辽西、热河等五省不完全的统计，共新开垦水田四十一万余亩，加上原有的二百九十二万亩（其中近二百万亩是在东北解放后的三年内恢复或增加的），全区今年水稻播种面积已达三百三十余万亩。
    随着农民生产热情的提高，今年水田耕作技术也有显著的改进。主要产稻区的松江、吉林和辽东三省，大部地区的农民都已改变了过去惯用的撒播法，而采用条播和点播的新播种法，这样不但节省了种籽、水分和便于除草，而且产量还能比撒播提高百分之二十到三十。优良稻种的推广也受到农民的普遍欢迎。吉林省的汪清、和龙、延吉等县的农民，还普遍使用温床育苗的办法，使生长期较长的优良稻种也能适于植当地种。
