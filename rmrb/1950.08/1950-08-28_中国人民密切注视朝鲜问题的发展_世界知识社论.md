Xinhua News Agency, August 26th: The *World Knowledge* magazine, volume 22, issue 8, published today, features an editorial entitled "Chinese People Closely Watch the Development of the Korean Issue," which states: It is only natural that the Chinese people are concerned about the Korean issue and the plight of our Korean brothers under the aggression of American imperialism. The friendly relationship between the Chinese and Korean people is close and long-standing. Especially in the last half-century, we have grown up together in the deep sorrow of being subjected to imperialist aggression. The relationship between our two countries can truly be described as sharing weal and woe. Every Chinese person follows the progress of the heroic battles of the Korean People's Army every day. We cheer every day for the continuous and brilliant victories of the Korean People's Army.

The editorial emphasizes that we firmly support the peaceful policy adopted by the Soviet Union in the United Nations, which is completely complementary to our stance of supporting the just war of the Korean people. The Soviet Union's proposal in the Security Council to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to enter the Security Council and to invite representatives of the Korean people to attend the Security Council to peacefully resolve the Korean issue is a completely just and reasonable proposal. This proposal has been unanimously and wholeheartedly supported by the people of the world. Although American imperialism and its lackeys are illegally manipulating the "extending machine" to build a "wall of resistance," American imperialism and its partners should know that their barbaric acts of aggression against Korea not only generally threaten peace in Asia and world peace, but also seriously affect China's security. The Chinese people cannot turn a blind eye to American imperialism's acts of aggression in Korea. The peaceful resolution of the Korean issue should first listen to the opinions of the Korean people, and secondly, it should listen to the opinions of the Chinese people, which is a matter of course. For the common security and interests of the Chinese and Korean people, and for the security and interests of the Asian people, the Chinese people have a decisive say in the event of American imperialism's aggression against Korea. Chairman Mao said: "Asian affairs should be managed by the Asian people themselves." This applies to Korea, and it applies to anywhere in Asia. The Asian people have firmly united. It is impossible to resolve Asian affairs without the participation of the Chinese people; it is even more impossible to resolve the Korean issue without the participation of China, which is nearby and represents 475 million people. If the imperialists still try to do so, they will only reap the bitter fruit. The era in which imperialist bandits arbitrarily arranged the fate of the Asian people is gone forever.

### 中国人民密切注视朝鲜问题的发展  世界知识社论

　　中国人民密切注视朝鲜问题的发展
    世界知识社论
    【新华社二十六日讯】今日出版的世界知识杂志二十二卷第八期，以“中国人民密切注视朝鲜问题的发展”为题发表社论，内称：中国人民关切朝鲜的事情，关切朝鲜兄弟在美帝国主义侵略下的遭遇，是理所当然的事。中朝两国人民的友爱关系是密切而久远的。尤其是最近半世纪以来，我们是在同受帝国主义侵略的深沉的忧患中长大起来。我们两国之间的关系真可谓是痛痒相关，休戚与共。我们每一个中国人民每天注视着朝鲜兄弟英勇战斗的进展。我们每天为朝鲜人民军接连不断的辉煌胜利欢呼。
    社论强调指出，我们坚决拥护苏联在联合国所采取的和平政策，这和我们声援朝鲜人民的正义战争的立场，是完全相辅相成的。苏联在安理会中建议中华人民共和国代表进入安理会，并邀请朝鲜人民代表列席安理会，以和平解决朝鲜问题，完全是正义的合理的建议。这一建议已为全世界人民所一致衷心拥护。美帝国主义及其附庸的喽啰们，尽管非法操纵“伸手机器”来堵立“抗拒的死墙”，但美帝国主义及其伙伴们应该知道，他们侵略朝鲜的野蛮行为不仅是一般地威胁亚洲和平与世界和平，而且严重地影响着中国的安全，中国人民不可能对美帝国主义在朝鲜的侵略行为熟视无睹，朝鲜事件的和平解决首先应该听取朝鲜人民的意见，其次就应该听取中国人民的意见，那是天经地义的事。为了中朝两国人民共同的安全和利益，为了亚洲人民的安全和利益，中国人民对于美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的事件，是有决定性的发言权的。毛主席说过：“亚洲的事务应由亚洲人民自己来管。”朝鲜如此，亚洲任何地方如此。亚洲人民已经坚固团结起来了。解决亚洲的事务，没有中国人民的参加是不可能的；解决朝鲜问题，没有近在咫尺的代表四万万七千五百万人口的中国的参加，更是不可能的。帝国主义倘如还妄图这样做，那只有自食其恶果。帝国主义强盗任意安排亚洲人民的命运的时代，是已经一去而不复返了。
