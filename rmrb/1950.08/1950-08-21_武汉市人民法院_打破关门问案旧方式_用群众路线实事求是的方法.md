　　Wuhan People's Court
    Breaks with the Old Way of Handling Cases Behind Closed Doors
    Employs the Mass Line and Seeks Truth from Facts
    Settles 1,100 Cases in One Month
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th] The Wuhan People's Court has adopted methods of investigation and research, and on-the-spot trials, settling over 1,100 new and old cases within a month. In the past, the court had a large backlog of cases. As of the end of May, the court had 998 civil cases pending, in addition to criminal cases. In response, the Central South Military and Political Committee and the Wuhan Municipal People's Government issued instructions to clear the backlog within a specified time. To implement these instructions, the court, together with the Municipal People's Procuratorate, the Municipal People's Supervision Committee, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, jointly organized a backlog clearing committee, which began work in early June. Beforehand, the working cadres drawn from various relevant departments were educated on relevant policies and the mass line.
    To facilitate understanding the truth of the cases, ensure fair and reasonable judgments, and save the litigants' time, the clearing work was conducted through on-the-spot trials. The Municipal People's Court divided the cadres into nine groups and stationed them in various districts. Trials were mostly conducted near the residences of the parties involved; more complex cases were tried at the district people's government. Before the trials, investigations and interviews were generally conducted to fully understand the cases. Local impartial people were also invited to participate in the trials to absorb the opinions of the masses. All judgments were submitted to the backlog clearing committee for approval to prevent errors or deviations. In this way, many long-unresolved cases were quickly resolved.
    For certain cases of the same nature that could be mediated, a collective mediation method was adopted. Before the trials of these cases, meticulous investigation and research were conducted. Cases that were more complex, of a general nature, and in which the parties were easily persuaded with reason were selected as typical cases. Then, the parties involved and impartial people agreed upon by both parties and invited by the court were summoned to the scene. Court cadres, in conjunction with typical cases, reported on the social roots of this type of case and explained in detail the policies and laws of the People's Government in dealing with such cases. Then, they were divided into groups for discussion to negotiate their own mediation methods. If mediation was successful, the court made a final decision. For the few cases that could not be mediated, judgments were made based on policies and laws and the opinions of the majority of those present. In one instance, the Fourth District of Hankou settled eleven cases on the spot out of fourteen debt cases convened.
    For some cases where the facts involved specialized knowledge, relevant experts were invited to assist in research and analysis. For example, there was a car accident case caused by a car driver racing for the road, where both sides strongly held their own reasons, making it difficult to judge. The court invited experienced members of the local drivers' union and the head of the automobile inspection institute to analyze the car's structure and performance, thereby clarifying the responsibility for the incident, and the case was thus resolved.
    Because the court implemented the working methods of following the mass line and seeking truth from facts, breaking with the old way of handling cases behind closed doors, the work of clearing the backlog has been basically completed as scheduled. From June 1st to June 31st, in addition to the original 998 pending civil cases, 728 new cases were accepted, and a total of 1,125 cases were processed. To further improve the trial work on the existing basis, in mid-July, the Municipal People's Court dispatched temporary working groups stationed in the districts to be responsible for handling new and old civil cases in the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts of Hankou, while also conducting propaganda on policies and laws and investigating and researching social conditions.

### 武汉市人民法院  打破关门问案旧方式  用群众路线实事求是的方法

　　武汉市人民法院
    打破关门问案旧方式
    用群众路线实事求是的方法
    一个月了结案件一千一百件
    【新华社汉口十七日电】武汉市人民法院采取调查研究、就地审讯的审判方式，一个月内了结新旧案件一千一百多件。以前一个时期，该法院积压案件很多。截至五月底止，该院除刑事案件外，共有民事积案九百九十八件。对此，中南军政委员会、武汉市人民政府曾发出限期清理积案的指示。为了执行这个指示，该法院与市人民检察署、市人民监察委员会和市公安总局等机关，共同组织积案清理委员会，于六月初开始清理工作。事前并对自各有关部门抽调来的工作干部，进行了各种有关政策和群众路线的教育。
    为便于了解案情真象，使判决公平合理，并节省诉讼人的时间起见，清理工作是采取就地审讯的方式来进行的。市人民法院将干部分成九个组，派驻各区。审讯地点大都在当事人居地附近；较复杂的案件，才在区人民政府进行审讯。审讯前，一般都进行了访问调查，充分了解案情。审讯时并邀请当地公正人士参加，吸收群众意见。所有判决都提请积案清理委员会通过，以防止错误或偏差。这样，很多长期不能了结的案件，都很快地获得解决。
    某些性质相同且可以调解的案件，则采取集体调解的方法。这些案件，在审判前须经缜密的调查和研究，选出较复杂的、带一般性的和当事人容易拿理说服的案件作为典型案件；然后召集各案当事人和当事人双方同意而由法院邀请的公正人士到场，由法院干部结合典型案件，报告该类案件产生的社会根源，并详细说明人民政府处理这类案件的政策法令；接着，将他们分成小组进行讨论，自己协商调解办法。成立调解的，由法院予以最后决定。对于少数不能调解的，就根据政策法令及大多数到场者的意见予以判决。汉口第四区在一次召集的十四件债务案件中，当场就了结了十一件。
    有些案件的案情涉及专门知识，便请有关的专门人员帮助研究和分析。例如有一件汽车司机因抢路争先造成的车祸案子，彼此强持自己的理由，难于判决。经法院邀请了当地司机工会中有经验的会员和汽车检验所负责人，从汽车的构造、性能方面进行了分析，从而弄清楚了事件的责任，该案因此获得解决。
    由于该法院在工作中贯彻了走群众路线和实事求是的工作方法，打破了关门问案的旧方式，清理积案工作已基本上如期完成。从六月一日到三十一日，除原有的民事积案九百九十八件外，又受理了七百二十八件新案，一共处理了一千一百二十五件。为了使审判工作在已有的基础上再提高一步，市人民法院并于七月中旬派出临时驻区工作组，负责处理汉口第三、四、五、六等四个区的新旧民事案件，同时进行宣传政策法令及调查研究社会情况等工作。
