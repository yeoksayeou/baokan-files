　　Xinhua News Agency, August 29th: The Soviet Government, through its embassy in the United States, sent a note to the U.S. Government on May 11th, protesting MacArthur's violation of the Far East International Military Tribunal's judgment in unilaterally deciding to release Japanese war criminals ahead of schedule. It also demanded that the U.S. Government immediately take measures to withdraw MacArthur's unilateral and illegal Fifth Directive of March 7th concerning the premature release of Japanese war criminals. In its reply of June 8th to the Soviet Government's aforementioned note, the U.S. Government refused to take measures to withdraw the illegal directive issued by MacArthur. Therefore, on August 25th, the Soviet Embassy in the United States, acting on instructions from the Soviet Government, once again sent a note to the U.S. Government, refuting the U.S. Government's reply and reiterating the demands insisted upon by the Soviet Government in its note of May 11th. A copy of this note has been delivered by the Soviet Government to the Central People's Government of China, as well as to the governments of other member states of the Far Eastern Commission.
　　The full text of the Soviet Government's note to the U.S. Government, dated August 25th, is as follows:
　　"The Soviet Embassy has received the U.S. Government's reply of June 8th to the Soviet Embassy's note of May 11th concerning General MacArthur's directive on the possible premature release of war criminals serving sentences in Japan, and, acting on instructions from the Soviet Government, has the honor to notify the following:
　　The U.S. Government, in its reply, supports General MacArthur's actions and refuses to take measures to withdraw his illegal Fifth Directive concerning the premature release of war criminals already sentenced by international tribunals. However, General MacArthur's authority to execute the judgments of the Far East International Military Tribunal is strictly bound by Article 17 of the aforementioned Tribunal's statute of January 19, 1946, and Section 5 of the Far Eastern Commission's resolution of April 3, 1946, concerning the arrest, trial, and punishment of Far East war criminals.
　　General MacArthur, in making a decision to allow the premature release of major Japanese war criminals, notoriously convicted by the International Military Tribunal for grave crimes against peace and humanity, has exceeded his authority and violated the agreements reached concerning Japan.
　　Neither the statute of the International Military Tribunal nor the resolution of the Far Eastern Commission of April 3, 1946, provides for the premature release of war criminals of this category after the sentence has been handed down for execution. In such circumstances, the Supreme Commander cannot take such a decision on his own authority. To take such a decision, the consent of all countries represented in the International Military Tribunal is required.
　　The U.S. Government's attempt to circumvent this clear provision, by arguing that premature release does not constitute a change in the judgment, is untenable. Premature release can only be considered not to be a change in the judgment, but rather a change in the manner of its execution, if such a manner of execution is prescribed by the laws upon which the judicial authorities and the executioners of the judgment rely. In the present case, such a manner of executing the judgment is not prescribed. Premature release, regardless of its conditions, is a change to the part of the judgment concerning the term of imprisonment.
　　To assert that the judgment has not been changed in this case is tantamount to saying that a war criminal who has been sentenced to imprisonment and has been released is still in prison.
　　The U.S. Government cites instances of premature release existing in many countries. However, this cannot serve as a defense for the aforementioned unilateral action by the Supreme Commander. Because what is being discussed here are not prisoners sentenced by the national courts of any individual country, but war criminals sentenced by the Far East International Military Tribunal, composed of the agreement of eleven countries, and the statutes of that military tribunal, as mentioned above, do not provide for premature release.
　　Based on the foregoing, the Soviet Government insists that the U.S. Government immediately take measures to withdraw General MacArthur's illegal Fifth Directive of March 7, 1950, concerning the major Japanese war criminals who have been sentenced by the Far East International Military Tribunal."

### 苏联政府再度照会美国政府  要求立即撤消提前释放日本战犯的指令

　　苏联政府再度照会美国政府
    要求立即撤消提前释放日本战犯的指令
    【新华社二十九日讯】苏联政府曾于五月十一日经由苏联驻美国大使馆，向美国政府致送照会一件，抗议麦克阿瑟违反远东国际军事法庭的判决，擅自决定提前释放日本战犯，并要求美国政府立即采取措施，撤消麦克阿瑟于三月七日片面地、非法地发布的关于提前释放日本战犯的第五号指令。美国政府在六月八日答复苏联政府上述照会的复文中，竟拒绝采取措施以撤消麦克阿瑟发布的非法指令。因此，苏联驻美国大使馆奉苏联政府之命，于八月二十五日再次照会美国政府，驳斥美国政府的复照，并重申苏联政府在其五月十一日的照会中所坚持的要求。该照会副本已由苏联政府分别递交我国中央人民政府以及远东委员会其他各会员国政府。
    苏联政府八月二十五日致美国政府照会的全文如下：
    “苏联大使馆接准美国政府六月八日为答复苏联大使馆五月十一日对于麦克阿瑟将军关于可能提前释放在日本执行受刑期的战犯的指令所提出的照会，并奉苏联政府的训令谨作如下通知：
    美国政府在其复照中支持麦克阿瑟将军的行动，并拒绝采取措施以撤消他所颁发的关于提前释放已由国际法庭所判决的战犯的非法的第五号指令。然而麦克阿瑟将军执行远东国际军事法庭判决的权限是受着一九四六年一月十九日上述法庭法规第十七条，及一九四六年四月三日远东委员会关于逮捕、审判及惩处远东战犯的决议第五节所严格约束的。
    麦克阿瑟将军对于众所周知的因为对和平与人类犯了重大罪行而已由国际军事法庭判决的日本主要战犯，采取了可以提前释放的决定，他就超越了自己的权限，并违背了有关日本所达成的协定。
    国际军事法庭的法规和一九四六年四月三日远东委员会的决议，都未曾规定在判决已交付执行之后，可以先期释放上述一类的战犯。在此等情况下，最高统帅不能擅自采取这种决定。要采取这种决定，必须取得所有派有代表参加在国际军事法庭机构内的各国的同意。
    美国政府的企图是要规避这一明确的规定，硬说先期释放并非判决书的变更。这种说法是不能成立的。只有在下述情况下先期释放，才不算变更判决书，而是变更其执行的方式，即这种执行方式是司法当局及判决执行人所依据法令所规定的。在本案件上并未规定这种执行判决书的方式。而先期释放，不论其条件如何，是变更了判决书中关于受刑期限的部分。
    断言在此情况下判决书并无改变，无异说获得释放的被判处徒刑的战犯，仍在监狱中。
    美国政府引证先期释放的实例，存在于许多国家。但这不能作为最高统帅上述片面行动的辩护。因为这里所讲的，不是指那些由任何个别国家的国家法庭所判决的犯人，而是那些由十一个国家的协议所组成的远东国际军事法庭所判决的战犯，而该军事法庭的法规，正如以上所述，并未有先期释放的规定。
    根据以上所述，苏联政府坚持要求美国政府立即采取措施，撤消一九五○年三月七日麦克阿瑟将军非法颁布的关于已由远东国际军事法庭所判决的日本主要战犯的第五号指令”。
