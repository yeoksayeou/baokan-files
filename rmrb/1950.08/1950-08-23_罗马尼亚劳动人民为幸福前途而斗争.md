　　The Romanian Laboring People Struggle for a Happy Future
　　Industrial Construction is Developing Daily
　　The production volume of the Romanian petroleum industry is approaching pre-war production levels. This year it will exceed six million tons, an increase of more than 55% compared to the lowest post-war production in 1944, and an increase of 32% compared to last year. In 1953, the output will exceed the highest pre-war production level by over eight million tons.
　　Romania's machine manufacturing industry is now producing a large quantity of petroleum extraction equipment, locomotives, river freighters, trucks, electric motors, and ball bearings, which could not be produced before the war. In the past two years, engine production has increased twelvefold, train engine production has increased 3.1 times, and electric motor production has increased 4.9 times.
　　Romania produced its first tractor in 1947. Compared with 1948, tractor production increased by 263% last year, tractor plows increased by 248%, and threshing machines increased by 8,840%. This year, tractor production will increase by more than 20%, cultivators will increase by 165%, and seeders will increase by 185%.
　　Under bourgeois and landlord rule, the highest power generation in Romania for sixty years never exceeded 600,000 kilowatts. After the completion of this year's electrification construction projects, power generation will increase by 267,000 kilowatts. By 1955, power generation will increase to 2.6 million kilowatts, 4.3 times that of pre-war levels.
　　Romania's steel production has exceeded pre-war levels by approximately one time. In 1939, the production of pig iron was 115,000 tons, last year it was 226,000 tons, and this year it will be 262,000 tons. In 1939, steel production was 267,000 tons, last year it was 417,000 tons, and this year it will be 486,000 tons. In 1955, it will produce 1 million tons of pig iron and 1.25 million tons of steel.
　　Romania's coal mining industry is beginning large-scale mechanization. Last year's production volume was 2,922,000 tons, exceeding pre-war levels by approximately 25%, and increasing by 22% compared to 1948. This year it will increase again by 13%. In 1955, the output will reach 8 million tons.
　　Romania's metallurgical and chemical industries are developing daily. There are now a total of 175 large enterprises. Last year's total production value was 71.7 billion lei, an increase of approximately 75% compared to 1948. This year's total production value will reach 91 billion lei, an increase of approximately 30% compared to last year.

　　Bucharest, TASS, 19th: In 1949 and 1950, Romania has built many new industrial enterprises. The oil refinery in the Moldavia region was completed and started operation in 1949. The new tool manufacturing plant in the Rasnov region, as well as several gas pipelines, have been completed, the most important of which is a gas main from Transylvania to Bucharest. A new sawmill has been built in Botoşani, and the construction of the largest textile factory in northern Moldavia has been completed. Part of the construction of the factory was completed at the end of 1949. A new large clothing factory in Bucharest was completed and started operation in 1949.

　　Education is Leaping Forward
　　Romania's education is developing by leaps and bounds. Since 1946, more than 1.6 million people have learned to read and write. By 1955, when the first Five-Year Plan concludes, illiteracy will be completely eliminated. The network of early childhood education institutions is developing. In old Romania, there were only 1,577 early childhood education institutions, but at the beginning of this year, the number increased to 3,710.
　　After the establishment of the people's democratic system, secondary schools and higher education institutions, as well as the number of students, have increased sharply. The number of primary and secondary schools has increased by 2,336 compared to 1939. In the past two years alone, the number of secondary school students has increased by more than 63,000. Higher education institutions now have 48,615 students, while in pre-war 1939, there were only 26,598 students.
　　The People's Government has created good material conditions for students. 25,000 university students receive scholarships, and more than 12,000 university students live in school-provided dormitories. Nearly half of the secondary school students also receive scholarships. [Xinhua News Agency]

　　罗马尼亚劳动人民为幸福前途而斗争
    工业建设日益发展
    罗马尼亚石油工业的生产量已接近战前生产水平，今年将超过六百万吨，较战后生产最低的一九四四年将增加百分之五十五以上，较去年将增加百分之三十二。一九五三年的产量将超过战前最高生产水平达八百万吨以上。
    罗马尼亚的机器制造业，现在正大量生产战前不能生产的开采石油的装备、机车、内河航轮、卡车、电动机和球轴承。两年来，引擎产量已增加十二倍，火车引擎产量已增加三点一倍，电动机已增加四点九倍。
    罗马尼亚在一九四七年生产了第一部拖拉机。与一九四八年相较，去年拖拉机生产增加了百分之二百六十三，拖拉机用犁增加了百分之二百四十八，打谷机增加了百分之八千八百四十。今年，拖拉机生产将增加百分之二十以上，中耕机将增加百分之一百六十五，播种机将增加百分之一百八十五。
    罗马尼亚在资产阶级和大地主统治下，六十年来最高发电量从未超过六十万千瓦。今年的电气化建设工程完成后，发电量即将增加二十六万七千千瓦。到一九五五年，发电量将增加到二百六十万千瓦，为战前的四点三倍。
    罗马尼亚钢铁产量已超过战前约一倍。一九三九年铣铁产量为十一万五千吨，去年为二十二万六千吨，今年将为二十六万二千吨。一九三九年钢产量为二十六万七千吨，去年为四十一万七千吨，今年将为四十八万六千吨。一九五五年将生产一百万吨铣铁和一百二十五万吨钢。
    罗马尼亚的采煤工业正开始大规模机械化。去年的生产量为二百九十二万二千吨，超过战前水平约百分之二十五，较一九四八年增加了百分之二十二，今年将再增加百分之十三。一九五五年的产量将达八百万吨。
    罗马尼亚的冶金与化学工业正在日益发展中。现在共有一百七十五个大企业。去年的生产总值为罗币七百一十七亿列伊，较一九四八年增加约百分之七十五。今年的生产总值将达九百一十亿列伊，将较去年又增加约百分之三十。
    塔斯社布加勒斯特十九日电：罗马尼亚在一九四九年和一九五○年中，已建设了许多新工业企业。摩尔达维亚地方的炼油厂已于一九四九年落成开工。拉斯诺夫地方的新工具制造厂，以及好几条煤气管都已落成，其中最重要的一条煤气总管，从达琅斯瓦尼亚通到布加勒斯特。在波托萨尼城已建造了新锯木厂，摩尔达维亚北部最大的纺织厂的建设工程已经完成。该厂的一部分建设工程在一九四九年底就已落成。布加勒斯特一家新的大被服厂，在一九四九年已落成开工。
    教育事业飞跃前进
    罗马尼亚教育事业正飞跃发展中。自从一九四六年以来，已经有一百六十多万人学会读书和写字。到一九五五年，即第一次五年计划告终时，文盲将被全部消灭。幼稚教育机关网正在发展中。在旧罗马尼亚，只有一千五百七十七所幼稚教育机关，本年初则增加到三千七百一十所。
    在人民民主制度建立后，中等学校和高等教育机关以及学生数目都有急剧的增加。小学和中学的数目较一九三九年增加了二千三百三十六所。在最近两年内，中学生的数目就增加了六万三千多人。高等教育机关现有四万八千六百一十五名学生，而在战前的一九三九年，则只有二万六千五百九十八名学生。
    人民政府为学生们创造了良好的物质条件。二万五千名大学生得到助学金，一万二千多名大学生住在学校供给的宿舍里。将近半数的中学生也得到助学金。【新华社】
