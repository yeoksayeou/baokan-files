(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) Since the end of March this year, parts of Hebei, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Suiyuan, and Chahar provinces in North China, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Jilin, and Rehe provinces in Northeast China, Xing'an League in Inner Mongolia, Henan in Central South China, Shandong in East China, and Shaanxi and Gansu provinces in Northwest China have been hit by hailstorms one after another; in addition, individual areas in Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan in Central South China, and Zhejiang and southern Anhui in East China have also experienced minor hail damage. The total affected area is approximately 12 million mu. Among them, Shanxi, Pingyuan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces suffered more severely. Shanxi Province alone experienced 110 hailstorms in 64 counties, with an affected area of approximately 4.1 million mu. However, under the strong leadership of governments at all levels and the Communist Party committees, the pessimistic mood among the masses due to the disaster was overcome, and replanting and crop conversion were completed in a timely manner, gaining some basic experience in overcoming hail disasters. The main experiences are as follows:

    1.  The leadership's attention and timely guidance are the most important factors in overcoming hail disasters. After the disaster occurred, local governments held emergency meetings, formulated specific plans to combat hail disasters according to different situations, and proposed "making every effort to replant and convert crops as the central task overriding everything else." Local leaders personally led a large number of cadres to go deep into the disaster areas, mobilize the masses, and carry out crash replanting and crop conversion to overcome the disaster. For example, Yang Zixiu and Zhi Yinglin, members of the Shanxi Provincial Government, and Jia Xinzhai, Vice Chairman of Pingyuan Province, personally led cadres after the hail disasters to promptly organize and mobilize the masses in the disaster areas for replanting and rescue. Shandong Province also has similar experience. At the same time, seeds, loans, and relief grain were distributed to solve the specific difficulties of insufficient seeds and urgent relief needs among the masses. The masses affected by the disaster, "thinking of their loved ones in times of difficulty," urgently requested the government to understand and sympathize with their suffering, and hoped that in their panic and confusion, they would be given ideas and solutions. Therefore, the above measures are very necessary.

    2.  Overcoming the ideological obstacles of the masses and stimulating their enthusiasm to fight against disasters also plays a significant role in completing the replanting work. The fruits of the masses' hard work, especially the wheat fields that were about to ripen, were destroyed by hail, and their mood was quite low, pessimistic, and resentful; coupled with the rumors and instigations of bad elements and illegal secret societies, such as saying "There's nothing to eat at home, nothing to see in the fields, and no way to survive after autumn," and "Planting in the ground is like putting it in the sky," the masses' mood became even more uneasy. In this situation, the cadres who went to the countryside mostly adopted the method of visiting and mobilizing households one by one, opening up the minds of the masses, and proposing action slogans and rescue methods such as "A day missed in spring, ten days missed in autumn" and "Stand up and find a way out," and then appropriately helping them solve the specific difficulties in replanting. As a result, the replanting and crop conversion movement was launched. For example, in Zhangyi Village, Changzhi County, Shanxi, after the masses' thinking was clarified, they automatically proposed the slogan "Ten-day Life-Saving Assault," and the whole village acted, completing the replanting work in less than ten days.

    3.  Mobilizing all labor to participate in the crash replanting movement, widely organizing labor mutual assistance, and organizing supply and marketing cooperatives to massively adjust seeds and mobilize the masses to exchange and borrow from each other to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and seeds in crash replanting, so that the replanting and crop conversion work can be carried out smoothly without missing the agricultural season. In the crash replanting process in various regions, temporary mutual aid groups have generally increased, and many women and children have also participated in the crash replanting movement. In Sandu Village, Yangquan, Shanxi, 116 women and 154 children replanted 960 mu of autumn seedlings in three days. Changzhi Fifth District also transferred livestock from non-disaster areas to disaster areas to help with crash replanting. These are also one of the important conditions for the successful completion of replanting and crop conversion tasks.

In addition, some areas, after completing the replanting and crop conversion tasks, immediately paid attention to organizing the disaster-stricken masses to combine weeding and other tasks with sideline production to solve the current difficulties caused by the disaster.

　　在人民政府中共党委大力领导下
    各地群众获得战胜雹灾基本经验
    【本报综合讯】今年三月底以来，华北的河北、山西、平原、绥远、察哈尔五省，东北的辽东、辽西、吉林、热河三省，内蒙的兴安盟，中南区的河南，华东的山东，西北的陕西、甘肃等省部分地区均先后受到冰雹袭击；此外中南的江西、湖北、湖南和华东的浙江、皖南等地的个别地区也发生轻微的雹灾。总计受灾面积约达一千二百余万亩。其中以山西、平原、河北、山东等省受灾较重，仅山西一省，即先后在六十四县降雹一百一十次，受灾面积约四百一十万亩。但在各级人民政府及中共党委的坚强领导下，克服了群众中因受灾害影响而发生的悲观情绪，及时完成补种改种，获得了若干战胜雹灾的基本经验。其主要经验如下：
    一、领导上重视，指导及时，是战胜雹灾的最重要一环。灾情发生后，各地人民政府均召开紧急会议，根据不同情况，作出向雹灾斗争的具体计划，提出“以全力补种改种，为当前压倒一切的中心任务”。各地领导人员并亲自率领大批干部，深入灾区，发动群众，突击补种改种，战胜灾害。例如山西省府委员杨自秀、支应遴，平原省副主席贾心斋均在雹灾发生后亲率干部，及时组织发动灾区群众补种抢救。山东省也有同样经验。同时各地发放了种籽贷粮和救济粮，以解决群众种籽不足和急需救济户的具体困难。受灾后的群众，“遇难思亲人”，迫切要求政府了解、同情他们的疾苦，并希望在心慌意乱，茫无所措的当儿，给他们出主意，想办法。因此上述的措施都是十分必要的。
    二、克服群众思想障碍，激发其向灾害作斗争的情绪，这对于完成补种工作，也有重大作用。群众辛勤劳作的果实，尤其是快接嘴的麦田被冰雹打毁后，情绪相当低落，悲观失望，怨天尤人；加以坏分子和不法会道门乘机造谣煽惑，如说什么“回到家里没吃头，到了地里没看头，秋后没活头”，“种在地里，放在天上”等；群众情绪更趋不安。在此情况下，各地下乡干部，多采取逐户访问、动员，打通群众思想，提出“春误一日，秋误十晌”和“站起来找活路”的行动口号和抢救办法，再适当的帮助他们解决抢种中的具体困难，于是补种、改种运动就开展起来了。如山西长治县漳沂村，群众的思想打通后，即自动提出“十天救命突击”口号，全村行动起来，不满十天，就完成了补改工作。
    三、发动所有劳力参加抢种运动，广泛组织劳力互助，并组织供销社大量调剂种籽和发动群众互换互借，以解决抢种中劳力和种子不足的困难，使补种改种工作得以不误农时顺利进行。各地在抢种中，临时互助组普遍增加，许多妇女和儿童也参加了抢种运动。山西阳泉三都村，一百十六个妇女，一百五十四个儿童，三天补种秋苗九百六十亩。长治五区并调剂非灾区的牲口到灾区帮助抢种。这些也都是顺利完成补种改种任务的重要条件之一。
    另外，有些地区，在完成补种改种任务后，立即注意了组织受灾群众结合锄苗等工作进行副业生产，以解决因受灾害而发生的当前困难。
