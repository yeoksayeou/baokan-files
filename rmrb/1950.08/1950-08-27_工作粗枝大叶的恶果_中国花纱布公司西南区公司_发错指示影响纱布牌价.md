　　The Evil Consequences of Sloppy Work
　　China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, Southwest District Company

　　Issuing Wrong Instructions Affects the Price of Gauze

　　Editor Comrade:

　　The Chongqing Xinhua Daily on August 9th, second edition, published the news "The Southwest District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation carelessly issued wrong instructions, causing the price of yarn in Wanxian to soar once." This incident educates us: How much harm does a sloppy work style cause to the people! I am now informing you of this matter, hoping you will publish it so that everyone can learn from this incident.

　　On July 22nd, the Southwest District Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation instructed the Wanxian Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation by letter to adjust the price according to the Chongqing Cotton Yarn and Cloth price list attached to the letter, plus the transportation costs, taxes, and profits between Yu (Chongqing) and Wanxian. The Wanxian Branch received the instructions on the 26th and discussed them with the Industry and Commerce Bureau. On the 28th, the yarn and cloth prices were adjusted: for example, Green Flying Shuttle yarn, originally priced at 5.95 million per package, was priced at 6 million in Chongqing, and was raised to 6.5 million after adding transportation costs, taxes, and profits; Yu Jingzhou yarn, originally priced at 6.1 million, was priced at 6.1 million in Chongqing, and was raised to 6.66 million; Double Happiness white cloth, originally priced at 200,000 per bolt, was raised to 238,000; and Meiting Indanthrene cloth, originally priced at 500,000, was raised to 573,000. The Wanxian Branch also instructed the Yunyang and Fengjie teams to follow the adjustment, causing the prices of yarn and cloth in the above three places to rise sharply.

　　On the afternoon of the 28th, the Wanxian Branch reported the adjusted prices to the Southwest District Company. The Southwest District Company found it very strange and called the Wanxian Branch that night, saying, "You have misunderstood the meaning of the instructions! The instructions only asked you to adjust the difference between the wholesale price and the retail price, and did not ask you to comprehensively adjust the price of yarn and cloth." The Wanxian Branch then read the original instructions to the Southwest District Company over the phone. The Southwest District Company said, "It's asking you to adjust 'gradually' to achieve the purpose of this instruction." However, there was no word "gradually" or other words with the same meaning in the entire text of the instruction. At that time, the Wanxian Branch had no choice but to ask the Southwest District Company to check the original draft of the instructions and issue new instructions. On the morning of the 29th, the Southwest District Company sent another telegram to the Wanxian Branch, saying that the instructions were "specifically referring to the adjustment of colored cloth, and the original price of standard cloth and standard yarn remains unchanged." Three instructions, three statements, left the person in charge of the Wanxian Branch's business section at a loss. Finally, the Wanxian Branch called the Southwest District Company again, only to learn that the original intention of the Southwest District Company's instructions was to have the Wanxian Branch make appropriate adjustments to the unreasonable yarn and cloth prices in the area according to the local market situation, so that the yarn and cloth prices would gradually and steadily rise to a reasonable level. So, they discussed with the Industry and Commerce Bureau and immediately lowered the prices of yarn and cloth: Green Flying Shuttle yarn was lowered by 200,000 per package, Yu Jingzhou yarn was lowered by 200,000 per package, Double Happiness white cloth was lowered by 13,000 per bolt, and Meiting Indanthrene cloth was lowered by 53,000 per bolt. However, Yunyang and Fengjie were unable to be notified in time and were not corrected until the 30th.

　　Due to the sloppy work style of the Southwest District Company, the spirit of "gradual and steady adjustment" was lost when issuing instructions, resulting in a fundamental error, which caused the prices of yarn and cloth in Wanxian, Yunyang, and Fengjie to be changed in the morning and evening, rising and falling sharply, causing the local market prices to fall into serious chaos, making the people greatly dissatisfied.

### 工作粗枝大叶的恶果  中国花纱布公司西南区公司  发错指示影响纱布牌价

　　工作粗枝大叶的恶果
    中国花纱布公司西南区公司
    发错指示影响纱布牌价编辑同志：
    八月九日重庆新华日报二版发表了“中国花纱布公司西南区公司粗枝大叶发错了指示，使万县纱价一度暴涨”的消息。这件事情教育我们：粗枝大叶的工作作风，给了人民多大的危害！我现在把这事转告你们，希望你们发表，使大家都能从这件事中取得教育。
    中国花纱布公司西南区公司在七月二十二日用信指示中国花纱布公司万县分公司，按照信里所附重庆市纱布牌价，加上渝万间的运杂费用、税捐、利润等调整牌价。万县分公司在二十六日接到指示，就和工商局研究。二十八日，将纱布牌价调整：如绿飞艇纱原价每包五九五万，重庆牌价是六○○万，加上运杂费用、税捐、利润后，挂升为六五○万；渝荆州纱原价六一○万，重庆牌价是六一○万，挂升为六六六万；双喜白布原价每匹二十万；挂升为二十三万八千；美亭阴丹布原价五十万，挂升为五十七万三千。万县分公司并指示云阳、奉节两个小组也遵照调整，致使上述三地的纱布价格猛烈上涨。
    二十八日下午，万县分公司将调整后的牌价报给西南区公司。西南区公司觉得很奇怪，当晚打电话给万县分公司说：“你们把指示的意思领会错了！指示只是叫你们调整批发价格与零售价格之间的差额，并不曾叫你们全面调整纱布牌价。”万县分公司就在电话中把指示原文念给西南区公司听。西南区公司说：“是叫你们‘逐渐’调整以达到这个指示的目的。”但是，指示全文中并没有“逐渐”字样和其他含义相同的字。当时万县分公司只好请西南区公司查查指示底稿，另作指示。二十九日晨，西南区公司又给万县分公司拍来电报，说指示是“专指调整花色布而言，标布、标纱原价不动”。三道指示，三个说法，弄得万县分公司业务科的负责人无所适从。最后，万县分公司又向西南区公司打电话，才知道西南区公司的指示，原意是让万县分公司把该地不合理的纱布价格，按照当地市场情况予以恰当的调整，使纱布价格逐渐地、稳步地上升到合理的水平。于是又与工商局研究，即日把纱布牌价挂低：绿飞艇纱每包挂低了二十万，渝荆州纱每包挂低了二十万，双喜白布每匹挂低了一万三千元，美亭阴丹布每匹挂低了五万三千元。而云阳、奉节两地，又无法及时通知，直至三十日才纠正。
    由于西南区公司粗枝大叶的工作作风，发指示时竟把指示中“逐渐地、稳步地调整”的精神丢失，发生原则性的错误，致使万县、云阳、奉节三地纱布牌价朝订夕改，暴涨暴跌，引起当地市价陷入严重混乱，使人民大为不满。
