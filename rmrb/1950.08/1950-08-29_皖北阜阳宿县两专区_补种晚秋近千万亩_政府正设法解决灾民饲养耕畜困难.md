　　Northern Anhui Fuyang and Suxian Special Districts
    Nearly 10 Million Mu of Late Autumn Crops Replanted
    Government Seeking Solutions to Difficulties in Feeding Livestock for Disaster-Stricken People
    [By Our Correspondents] In the Fuyang and Suxian Special Districts of Northern Anhui Administrative Region, disaster-stricken people have replanted nearly ten million mu of late autumn crops. According to incomplete statistics from the ten counties under the Suxian Special District, including Wuhe, Huaiyuan, Xiaoxian, Sixian, Sihong, Lingbi, Dangshan, and Suxian, over 4.25 million mu of late autumn crops, such as buckwheat and carrots, have been replanted, accounting for 40% of the flooded area. If the water continues to recede, another 1.5 million to 2 million mu can be replanted. The counties in the Fuyang Special District have also replanted 5.7 million mu. The Northern Anhui Administrative Office has called on the entire region's disaster-stricken people to replant 9 million to 13 million mu of late autumn crops. Judging from the current situation, this replanting task can be guaranteed to be completed.
    With only one month left until the wheat season (winter wheat), according to preliminary statistics from the Fuyang Special District, Northern Anhui is short 310 million jin of wheat seeds, and approximately 100,000 head of draught cattle have been sold, slaughtered, or lost throughout the region. Currently, over 500,000 head of draught animals remain, but they cannot be fed due to a lack of fodder. After the East China Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's Production and Disaster Relief Work Team arrived in Hefei, they have repeatedly discussed the issue of protecting draught animals in disaster areas with the Northern Anhui Administrative Office. Specific plans have now been proposed and will be implemented upon approval from higher authorities. At the same time, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office issued instructions on August 24 regarding the protection of draught animals in disaster areas. On the one hand, disaster-stricken people are urged to endure temporary difficulties for the sake of long-term interests. On the other hand, instructions have been given to relocate draught cattle to non-disaster areas, requiring governments at all levels to lead and assist disaster-stricken people in completing this task.

　　皖北阜阳宿县两专区
    补种晚秋近千万亩
    政府正设法解决灾民饲养耕畜困难
    【本报综合讯】皖北行政区阜阳、宿县两专区灾民补种晚秋已近一千万亩。宿县专区所属五河、怀远、萧县、泗县、泗洪、灵璧、砀山、宿县等十县，据不完全统计，已补种荞麦、胡萝卜等晚秋作物四百二十五万余亩，占淹地面积的百分之四十，如水继续下退，还可补种一百五十万到二百万亩。阜阳专区各县亦已补种五百七十万亩。皖北行署曾号召全区灾民补种晚秋九百万亩到一千三百万亩，照目前情形估计，这一补种任务是可以保证完成的。
    现距麦期（冬麦）只有一个月时间，据阜阳专区初步统计，皖北缺麦种三亿一千万斤，又全区出卖、屠杀损失耕牛约十万头。现仍有五十余万头耕畜，因缺乏饲料，无法喂养。华东农林部生产救灾工作队到合肥后，已与皖北行署数度商讨，保护灾区的耕畜问题，现已提出具体计划，待上级批准后，即可施行。同时皖北行署又于八月二十四日发出保护灾区耕畜的指示，一方面要灾民忍受暂时困难，为长远利益打算，一面又指示出移耕牛到非灾区安插的办法，要各级政府领导并帮助灾民完成这一任务。
