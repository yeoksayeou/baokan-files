　　The Realism of "The Great Battle of Stalingrad"

　　The Soviet film "The Great Battle of Stalingrad" (Note 1) is a comprehensive and faithful depiction of the historical facts of the Great Patriotic War. According to Er. Yuliyev (Note 2), the characters, events, and dialogues are all real. They are people who exist now and once existed. They are things the protagonist did and words he said. Most of the exterior shots were filmed at the original locations where the events took place. Why does this film adopt this creative method? One reason, I think, is that the heroes and their achievements in reality are already very much in line with ideals, so there is no need for any fiction.

　　But this artistic film that relies on historical facts is, after all, an artistic film. It has significant differences from ordinary documentaries. The main difference lies not in its ability to grasp the key points of this battle and boldly cut it down without weakening the magnificent scale of this historical fact; but in its appropriate and concentrated depiction of the tense and complex situation of the great Soviet Red Army's strategic defense to strategic offense against the German invaders. It can organize representative characters and events in an orderly manner, with emphasis, rationally and vividly, and appropriately use imagination to fully express the profound significance of this major event.

　　This film, which respects reality without being confined to facts, is different from the creative method of creating sensational plots out of thin air, relying on accidental changes or unexpected encounters to frighten or confuse the audience, and building empty frameworks based on the concept of the topic, without any factual basis, for the sake of drama. It is also different from the creative method of sticking to real people and real events like a hodgepodge, and flatly recording phenomena.

　　In a hurry, I am not prepared to comprehensively and systematically introduce or analyze the artistic achievements of this film. I will only try to give one or two examples of the realism of the characters' personalities and scenes to illustrate the reason why this film can achieve such a moving effect. First of all, let's talk about a character.

　　Everyone knows that this war was extremely arduous. As General Chuikov, who was at the front, said: "Arduous, unprecedentedly arduous." But Stalin clearly knew that handing over the city of Stalingrad meant handing over the fate of all mankind. He was able to grasp the strategy of defense and the strategy of offense. His movements, postures, and expressions when he understood the situation, decided on plans, issued orders, and met with friends all had a significant and consistent characteristic: calmness, serenity, and confidence.

　　When he was discussing strategy at home with his old comrades who defended Tsaritsyn; when he praised the artillery commander's full preparation, humorously saying "smart little notebook"; when he instructed the front-line commanders to be "more lenient" with the prisoners; when the enemy general Paulus was captured, the enemy was completely wiped out, Stalin announced "Stalingrad has come to an end, and we should think further ahead in the future," and slowly moved the magnifying glass from the city of Stalingrad on the map to Berlin, squinting his level eyes, symbolizing the vision of cleaning up Hitler's nest; Stalin's demeanor was very calm, serene, and full of confidence, which is easy to understand. However, when the powerful enemy launched repeated fierce attacks, parts of the front line were breached, the city of Stalingrad had become a sea of ​​fire, and the strategic stronghold that both sides had to contend for was likely to completely fall, and the enemy was about to realize their delusion of opening up the road to Moscow, but Stalin, who was in charge of the entire battle plan, believed that the time for reinforcements had not yet come, so he issued the instruction "No matter how much the commanders complain, not even a company of people should be transferred to comfort them"; believing that the Stalingrad front must be reinforced, and warning the troops tasked with reinforcement "No delays are allowed, delay is a political crime"; ... the film artists all used a demeanor of diligence, prudence, and consideration, but calmness, serenity, and confidence to portray him. Why, before this series of serious plots, did Stalin, as the protagonist in the art, use such a demeanor to describe him? There is no other reason, because in fact, Stalin, as the object of artistic imitation, originally possessed this characteristic of character. At the same time, it is also due to the fact that the objective environment he was in, although difficult, was still favorable. That is to say: because he has been tempered for a long time, he originally possessed a clear, noble, simple, and confident character; even more so because he is a leader who loves the people, believes in the people, and is loved by the people; because he is a leader who has contributed unparalleled strength in decades of revolutionary war and national construction and created unparalleled happy lives for the people, gaining the love and trust of the people; because he is a far-sighted and creative military genius; because he is the supreme commander who can create and grasp the strategy from defense to counter-offensive; because those led by him are working people who have been tested by the revolution, love their own class, and love their motherland; because the Soviet Union he leads possesses unparalleled spiritual and material strength; because he fully understands the enemy, who is crazy and powerful, but has insurmountable weaknesses. Then, this calm, serene, and confident image is completely based on reality.

　　To repeat, the reason why film artists can create such a noble and great image is by no means because the artists only embellish it according to the concepts of nobility and greatness, and create the image from form. It is nothing more than simply "imitating" the character of this noble and great leader of the world's working people and his environment, based on the characteristics of the object and its environment.

　　Some people raise this question: Is "The Great Battle of Stalingrad" part of Stalin's biography? I think: it has biographical characteristics, but it is not equal to a biography. Just like Stalin's great role in this battle that reversed the situation of the anti-fascist war, this film painstakingly praises Stalin. But at the same time, this film should also be regarded as a praise for the entire Soviet people. I think: it focuses on writing about Stalin's leadership, but it is also focusing on writing about the Soviet people. This is not only because there are many scenes in the film that depict cadres and masses who faithfully, bravely, and resolutely accept orders and perform tasks, but more importantly, Stalin himself is the representative of the wishes and ideals of the masses, the embodiment of wisdom and strength. Stalin is a major character in the film, but focusing on depicting Stalin does not mean ignoring the important significance of other cadres and the masses. On the contrary, I think: Stalin's nobility and greatness are inseparable from the characteristics of the Soviet people, who possess clear thinking, firm character, and patience (Note 3). Just as the victory at the front cannot be separated from Stalin's wise leadership, the initiative and organization of the masses are conditions that, in turn, guarantee the correctness and creativity of Stalin's leadership. Depicting the masses and the enemy is to depict Stalin; at the same time, depicting Stalin and the enemy is to depict the masses. If this steel-like giant is not interspersed among steel-like soldiers, if it is not in sharp contrast with the enemy, who is actually fragile, but is crazy and ferocious, it is more difficult to truly, rather than vaguely, inspire admiration, and to recognize the greatness and nobility of the immortal Stalin so credibly rather than conceptually.

　　In any case, Stalin's image is portrayed very successfully. If the excellent screenwriter Nikolai Virta was not familiar with the documents, plans, maps, combat orders, intelligence, prisoner confessions, records, photos, and film footage related to the Battle of Stalingrad; if he did not receive theatrical help from marshals and generals down to soldiers and city residents; if director Vladimir Petrov and Alexei Dikiy, who played Stalin, had not been concerned with and studied the portrait, posture, language, psychology, and temperament of the giant Stalin; but instead merely catered for the sake of catering, or contrasted for the sake of contrast, it would have been impossible to portray the image of Stalin himself, who is so loved, so accurately, delicately, and vividly.

　　Secondly, let's try to talk about a mass scene.

　　Wise viewers can certainly recall that the scenes in this film are full of unusually rich changes. The enemy's two large-scale and frantic offensives, the Red Army's two forceful crossings to reinforce Stalingrad under fierce artillery fire, the hand-to-hand combat at the train station and Pavlov's House, the oaths and devotion to duty of the front-line soldiers, the former proud victors of Europe, their initial arrogance and ferocity, and their subsequent embarrassment in the face of hunger, cold, and death; etc., etc., are all thrilling, fascinating, and full of change and realism scenes. Moreover, they are not scenes for the sake of excitement, but scenes for properly explaining the theme. They are not scenes for the sake of novelty, but scenes for accurately portraying the image. I am not prepared to compare and study the realism of these many scenes one by one; I will only express some observations on the scene where Generals Vasilevsky and Malenkov call on the defenders of Stalingrad to strengthen their combat.

　　Stalingrad is a strategic stronghold that determines the fate of the Soviet Union and the fate of all mankind, and is the hub for fatally striking fascist Germany. Holding every street and every building has its significant meaning—winning time and thoroughly eliminating the enemy. Therefore, Stalin announced: "Regardless of any sacrifices, do not stop fighting, attack the enemy day and night, and hold Stalingrad firmly." (approximate) Therefore, General Malenkov, representing the Supreme Command, called on the Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and workers of this heroic city... "Do not panic, do not fear the shameless enemy, ... resolutely defend Stalingrad...". And those people of Stalingrad, who have a brand-new ideology, fully understand their glorious tasks, have excellent revolutionary traditions, and are loyal to the Soviet motherland, respond to this call with actions and with blood and flesh. They know that without doing so, they cannot complete the tasks given by history, and at the same time, they are helping the enemies of the entire Soviet Union and all mankind. According to the situation at the time, defense was arduous, but the people understood the great significance of defending Stalingrad.

　　In terms of artistic techniques, how does the film handle this big scene? When Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, workers, and citizens converge from various streets into an iron stream of people, passing through ruins and rubble fields (the once beautiful city that they had diligently built), solemnly, silently, with heavy hatred and determination, heading to the front. Even though General Malenkov, representing Stalin (that is, representing the people of the whole country), is saying loud and moving words to the advancing heroes, "Comrade Stalin is not here, but he is always with us!", most of these steel-like people, except for some who clearly respond to the call with their eyes, are heavily and seriously moving forward—in some people's words, "without expression". But is this really without reaction or expression? No. This silence and steady advance is the greatest reaction and the most obvious expression. This expression shows that the heroes are deeply engraved in their hearts the significance of the call "Comrade Stalin is always with us."

　　If the creators of this artwork did not start from reality, did not remain faithful to specific plots, misunderstood passion and used conventional expressions, and generally shouted "Comrade Stalin is always with us" or "Long live Comrade Stalin," or shouted "Respond to Comrade Stalin's call," what would the effect be? Needless to say, even if it appears passionate on the surface, it can never truthfully, accurately, and clearly portray the special characters and their psychology in such special circumstances. The Soviet people, who were originally cheerful, lively, and serious, are now filled with regret for the city they built with their own labor that has been destroyed, mourning and concern for the close relatives who have been slaughtered and ravaged, boundless love for the Soviet motherland, hatred for the fierce and foolish enemy, and a determination to sacrifice themselves without fear of bloodshed. Artists must truthfully introduce this psychological state to the audience. This scene appropriately expresses this psychological state. At the same time, the artists know what should be emphasized in this scene, and what should be emphasized. And the audience can clearly understand this special and complex psychology from the existing handling method, and therefore this scene is filled with heartfelt resonance.

　　The reason why artists are unwilling to appear passionate on the surface and are unwilling to arbitrarily dominate their roles for the sake of superficial passion exactly shows that these excellent artists are faithful to reality and also consider the effect that this scene should have. In a word: the reason why these scenes and expressions can have a high degree of realism should be attributed to the artists' serious and profound understanding of the plot.

　　Of course, it is not to say that this kind of plot handling method is the only one, but it is indeed the most realistic and the most persuasive.

　　Needless to say: the expressions in such scenes are completely different from the expressions in scenes such as the frenzied cheers at the meeting in Kalach after strategically encircling, compressing, and destroying the enemy one by one. At the meeting in Kalach, if there is no frenzied cheering, and one insists on being dogmatic about being reserved, and stubbornly forces the heroes full of irrepressible jubilation to become mute, that is an artistic crime. But at the same time, if slogans are abused in the scene of going to the battlefield, it is also a violation of the basic principles of realism. Two different scenes have two different contents, which therefore determine two different forms. Obviously, this different expression method originally exists in reality itself, but it is only expressed in art in a more concentrated, simpler, and more emphasized way. Just like the entire film grasps the essence of reality, in fact, the depiction of these scenes is basically a simple "imitation" of objective reality. We only need to recall or analyze the two different war purposes of the enemy and us, the two different strategic thinking, the two different military cadres, the two different soldier masses, ... we can assert that all the techniques of the entire film are based on a certain content.

　　This film, of course, is not without shortcomings (structurally, some scenes in the second half can be compressed further, and the clues can be clearer), although it is not the best film (we will soon see the better "The Fall of Berlin"), but it is indeed a good film worth learning from. Just like the Battle of Stalingrad itself, it also has a clear originality—positively "recording" history without flatly copying historical materials. It is gratifying that it often makes the audience forget that they are viewers in the cinema, and are filled with hatred along with the distraught mother of the bombed child, are as nervous as the front-line officers and soldiers waiting for reinforcements, and experience the battle as hard as the twelve, three, or one soldier who are holding the building; deeply realize the resoluteness of General Chuikov, who said "Either sacrifice or hold on" when responding to the call. ... In a word, due to the strong sense of realism created by the film in all aspects, it takes us into the great battle of 1942, breathing, angry, and happy with the combatants. Although I have only mentioned one character and one scene, wise readers will certainly not ignore the rich content or think that I am only satisfied with the benefits of one character and one scene.

### 《斯大林格勒大血战》的真实感

　　《斯大林格勒大血战》的真实感
    苏联电影《斯大林格勒大血战》（注一），是全面地、忠实地描写伟大卫国战争的历史事实的电影。据尔·尤里叶夫（注二）的介绍，不论是人物，是事件，是对话，都是真实的。是现在的和曾经存在过的人。是主人公做过的事和说过的话。大多数的外景是在发生事变的原地拍摄的。这电影为什么采取这一创作方法呢？原因之一，我以为：由于现实的英雄及其业迹已经很能符合理想，用不着任何虚构。
    但这一部依靠历史事实的艺术片，到底是艺术片。它和一般的记录片有显著的区别。主要的区别不在于它抓得住这一战役的要点，大胆地加以剪裁，又不减弱这一史实的壮阔规模；而在于它恰当地集中地描写了伟大的苏联红军对德国侵略者从战略防御到战略进攻这一紧张复杂的情景，能把代表的人物和事件，有秩序，有轻重，合理而生动地加以组织，并适当的运用想象，充分表现出这一大事件的深刻意义。
    这一尊重实际，又不拘于事实的片子，和没有实际根据，为戏剧性而戏剧性，凭空制造惊人的情节，依靠偶然变故或意外遭遇来恐骇或迷惑观众，按题目的概念搭空架子的创作方法不同。也和大杂烩似地拘泥于真人真事、平板地记录现象的创作方法不同。
    匆促间，笔者不准备全面地系统地介绍或分析这一影片在艺术上的成就。只试图举一两个有关人物性格和场面的真实性的例子，来说明这一电影能获得如此感人的效果的原因。首先，我们来谈一个人物。
    大家都知道：这一战争是异常艰苦的。正如前线的崔可夫将军所说：“艰苦，从来没有的艰苦。”但斯大林明明知道交出斯城就是交出全人类的命运，他掌握得住防御的战略和进攻的战略，在他了解情况、决定方案、发布命令以及接见朋友时的动作、姿态、表情，都有一种显著的一贯的特征。——镇静、安祥和充满信心。
    当他在家里和保卫察里津的老战友谈论战略的时候；当他称赞炮兵司令的充分准备，幽默地说着“聪明的小本子”的时候；当他指示前线指挥官对俘虏要“再宽大些”的时候；当敌将巴罗士被俘，敌人完全被消灭，斯大林宣告“斯大林格勒已经告一段落，今后该想得远一点了”，而且把扩大镜从地图上的斯城慢慢移向柏林，眯着平视的眼睛、象征着清扫希特勒匪窠的远景的时候；斯大林的风度十分镇静、安祥和充满信心，很容易理解。但是，当强大的敌人数度猛扑，战线部分被突破，斯城已变成一片火海，双方必争的战略要地很有完全陷落可能，敌人即将实现打通到莫斯科的道路的妄想，但掌握全部战役计划的斯大林，认为还不到增援的时机，因而发出“不管司令官如何叫苦，连一营人也不准调去安慰他们”的指示的时候；认为斯城前线必须增援，并警告担任增援任务的部队“不允许任何拖延，拖延就是对政治的犯罪”的时候；……电影艺术家都用的是虽然辛勤、谨慎、思虑，然而镇静、安祥、充满信心的风度来刻画着的。为什么在这一系列严重情节之前，作为艺术中的主角的斯大林，要用这样的风度来描写呢？没有别的，那因为在事实上，作为艺术之模仿对象的斯大林，本来就具备着这一性格的特征的缘故。同时，也由于他所处的客观环境虽然艰苦但是有利的缘故。这就是说：因为他长期经受锻炼，本来就具备着明朗、高尚、单纯、充满信心的性格，更因为他是一个热爱人民、相信人民、并受人民爱戴的领导者；因为他是曾经在几十年的革命战争和建国工作中贡献了无比的力量并为人民创造了无比的幸福生活，取得人民的爱戴和信托的领袖；因为他是一个有远见有创造性的军事天才；因为他是创造得出掌握得住从防御到反攻战略的最高统帅；因为被他领导的是经过革命的考验，热爱自己阶级，热爱自己的祖国的劳动人民；因为他所领导的苏联具备着无比强大精神和物质的力量；因为他十分理解虽然疯狂、强大，然而是具有无法克服的弱点的敌人。那么，这种镇静、安祥和充满信心的形象完全是有现实根据的。
    重复地说，电影艺术家之所以能够创造如此崇高伟大的形象，决不是因为艺术家只按照崇高和伟大的概念而妄加修饰，从形式出发来创造形象。无非是根据对象及其环境的特征，朴素地“模仿”着这一崇高伟大的世界劳动人民领袖的性格及其环境而已。
    有人提出这样的问题：《斯大林格勒大血战》是不是斯大林传记的一部分呢？我以为：有传记性质，但不等于传记。正如斯大林在这一扭转反法西斯战争情势的战役中的伟大作用一样，这部片子，是着力地歌颂着斯大林的。但同时，这部片子也应该当成对整个苏联人的歌颂来看待。我以为：它着重地写斯大林的领导，同时也即是着重写着苏联人。这不仅因为片子中有很多场面是写的忠诚、勇敢、坚决地接受命令执行任务的干部与群众，更重要的是斯大林本身就是群众愿望和理想的代表，智慧和力量的化身。斯大林是片中一个主要人物，但着重描写斯大林并不等于忽视其他干部和群众的重要意义。正相反，笔者以为：斯大林的崇高和伟大，和拥有清晰思想、坚忍品质与忍耐精神（注三）的苏联人民的特点分不开。正如前方的胜利不能和斯大林的英明领导分开一样，群众的积极性组织性是反过来保证斯大林领导的正确性与创造性的条件。描写群众以及敌人是为了描写斯大林；同时，描写斯大林以及敌人是为了描写群众。如果不是把这一钢似的巨人照应地穿插在钢似的将士中间，如果不是和其实是脆弱，然而是疯狂、凶猛的敌人作着鲜明的对照，就较难真实地而不是空泛地引人崇敬，如此可信地而不是概念地认识到不朽的斯大林的伟大和崇高。
    不论如何，斯大林的形象是刻画得非常成功的。如果不是优秀的剧作者恩考莱·维尔塔熟悉了有关斯大林格勒战役的文件、计划、地图、作战命令、情报、俘虏口供、记录、照片和电影片；如果不是从元帅和将军直到士兵、城市居民得到剧作上的帮助；如果不是导演甫拉季米尔·别特洛夫和斯大林饰演者阿略克塞·吉基对于巨人斯大林的肖像、姿态、语言、心理、气质的关心与钻研；而是为照应而照应，为对比而对比，要能如此确切地细腻地生动地刻画出令人十分敬爱的斯大林本人似的形象，那是不可能的。
    其次，我们试谈一个群众场面。
    贤明的观众当然能够回想：这部片子的场面充满了异常丰富的变化。敌人两度大规模的疯狂的进攻，增援斯城的红军在猛烈炮火之下的两度强渡，车站与巴甫洛夫大楼的肉搏，前线将士们的宣誓和忠于职责，曾经是高傲的欧洲的胜利者，开始时的狂妄、凶横，和以后在饥寒与死亡面前的狼狈；等等，等等，都是惊心动魄的、富有魅力的、充满变化、充满实感的场面。而且，都不是为了热闹，而是为了恰当交代主题的场面。都不是为了新奇，而是为了准确的刻画形象的场面。笔者不准备一一地比较和研究这许多场面的真实感；仅就华西列夫斯基与马林科夫将军向斯城保卫者号召加强战斗的场面，发表一些观感。
    斯大林格勒是决定苏联命运决定全世界人类命运的战略要地，是致命地打击法西斯德国的枢纽。每一条街道，每一座房子的守住都有其重大意义——赢得时间，彻底消灭敌人。因此，斯大林宣布：“不论任何牺牲，不停止战斗，日夜攻击敌人，坚守斯大林格勒。”（大意）所以，代表最高统帅部的马林科夫将军号召这英雄城市的共产党员、共青团员、工人们……“不要发生恐慌，不要惧怕无耻的敌人，……坚决保卫斯大林格勒……”。而那些具有崭新的思想意识，十分懂得自己光荣任务，有革命的优良传统，忠于苏维埃祖国的斯城人民，是用行动，用血肉来响应这一号召的。他们知道，不如此，就不能完成历史所给予的任务，同时等于帮助全苏联全人类的敌人。按当时情况，保卫是艰苦的，但是人民懂得保卫斯城的重大意义。
    在艺术手法上，电影如何处理这一大场面呢？当共产党员、共青团员、工人们、市民们从各个街道汇成铁的人流，经过废墟和瓦砾场（自己辛勤地建设起来的曾经美丽过的街市），庄严地沉默地、带着沉重的仇恨和决心，走向前线。尽管那代表着斯大林（也就是代表全国人民）的马林科夫将军向前进着的英雄们说着“斯大林同志虽然不在这里，但是他永远和我们在一起！”的响亮的、动人的话，而这些钢铁般的人，除了部分人用眼睛明显地回答号召之外，绝大多数是沉重地、严肃地前进着——照有些人的说法，是“没有表情”地向前行进着。但这真是没有反响没有表情吗？不是的。这沉默和稳步前进就是最大的反响，最明显的表情。这表情说明英雄们在心的深处深刻地铭刻着“斯大林同志永远和我们在一起”这号召的意义。
    假如说，这一艺术品的制作者不从实际出发，不忠于具体情节，误解激情而用常套的表现方式，一般化地高呼“斯大林同志永远和我们在一起”或高呼“斯大林同志万岁”，或高呼着“响应斯大林同志号召”，那效果如何呢？不用说，即使表面上显得激情，但绝不能如实地、准确地、明朗地，刻画出这些处在什么样的特殊环境里的特殊的人物及其心理。本来是愉快活泼而又是认真的苏联人，而今满怀着对被毁的用自己劳力建立起来的城市的惋惜，对已经和那时被屠杀和蹂躏的亲骨肉的哀悼与关怀，对苏维埃祖国的无限的爱，对凶猛而愚蠢的敌人的仇恨，和不怕流血的自我牺牲的决心。艺术家必须如实地把这种心理状态介绍给观众。这一场面是恰如其分地表达了这种心理的。同时艺术家知道这一场面中应该着重描写什么，什么是应该着重描写的。而观众从现有的处理方式，分明地体会得出这种特殊的复杂的心理，因而对这一场戏充沛着由衷的共鸣。
    艺术家之所以不愿在表面上显得激情，不愿为了表面化的激情而任意支配自己的角色，正好说明这些优秀的艺术家是忠于现实，也考虑到这一场面应有的效果。一句话：其所以能使这些场面、表情具有高度的真实感，应该归功于艺术家对于情节的理解的认真和深刻。
    当然，不是说这种情节的处理方式是唯一的，但确是最有真实感、最有说服力的。
    不用说：这样的场面和按照战略计划包围、压缩、各个击破敌人之后，在卡拉奇会师时狂热地欢呼等等场面的表情迥然不同。在卡拉奇会师，如果不狂热的欢呼，而要教条主义地讲究含蓄，硬要充满着不可抑止的狂欢心情的英雄变哑巴，那是一种艺术上的犯罪。但同时，赴战场这场戏如果滥用口号，同样是违反现实主义的基本原则。两个不同的场面有两个不同的内容，因此决定了两种不同的形式。很显然，这种不同的表现方式本来就存在于现实本身，无非在艺术上比较集中比较单纯，也比较强调地加以表现而已。如同整个片子都掌握得住现实本质一样，其实，这些场面的描写，基本上是朴素的“模仿”着客观实际的。我们只要回想或分析一下敌我双方两种不同的战争目的，两种不同战略思想，两种不同军事干部，两种不同士兵群众，……就可以断言整部片子的一切手法都根据着一定的内容。
    这部片子，当然不是没有欠缺的（在结构上，后半部某些场面还可以压缩些，线索还可以再分明一些），它虽不是最好的片子（不久将看到更好的“攻克柏林”），但它确是一部值得学习的好片子。正如斯大林格勒战役本身一样，它也具备着鲜明的独创性——正面地“记录”历史而又不是平板地抄录着史实的材料。可喜的是：常常使观众忘记自己是在电影院里做看客，而同被炸死孩子的失神的母亲一同充满仇恨，同等候增援的前线官兵一样紧张，同坚守大楼的十二个、三个、一个战士那样坚苦地经历着战斗；深深体会到响应号召时说出“不是牺牲就是守住”的崔可夫将军的坚决。……一句话，由于电影在各方面所造成了强烈的真实感，把我们带进一九四二年的大战斗中，同战斗者一同呼吸、一同愤怒、一同愉快。笔者虽然只提到一个人物一个场面，贤明的读者决不会因此忽视了丰富的内容，或以为笔者只满足于一个人物一个场面的好处。
