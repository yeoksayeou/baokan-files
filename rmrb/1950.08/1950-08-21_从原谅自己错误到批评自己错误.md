From Forgiving My Own Mistakes to Criticizing My Own Mistakes
Wan Zhensan, Secretary of the CPC Taiping County Committee, Southern Anhui

Rectification study has been of great help to me. After listening to the relay of the spirit of the Rectification Conference, and in conjunction with studying the documents and examining myself, and after much thought and ideological struggle, I have made the following preliminary self-criticism:

First, I exposed my habit of disliking criticism. Because of my petty-bourgeois concern for face, in the past I was always unwilling to criticize each other, but preferred self-criticism—in this case, self-criticism cannot fully expose my ideological problems; I was unwilling to criticize in the presence of the masses, but preferred to criticize at Party meetings; I was unwilling to criticize in writing, but preferred to criticize verbally. Even more seriously, after making mistakes or discovering shortcomings, I often found reasons to excuse myself and harbored the idea of being a meritorious official. For example, in late June last year, when I was the county head in Qingyang, I beat someone while interrogating a case. After the beating, I realized that I had made a mistake and made a self-criticism at the "July 1st" Party member meeting, as well as at the county party committee meeting. However, because of the above-mentioned problems in my thinking, the self-criticism and reflection were not profound, but rather superficial and perfunctory. Later, after seeing the criticisms of me by the higher-level party committee in the documents of the prefectural committee and the organizational meeting of the regional party committee, I felt burdened again, thinking, "It is a fact that I made a mistake, but I have also done some work!" "The leadership shouldn't disregard this point, right?" I wanted to bargain with the Party and the people, conceal my mistakes and shortcomings, and avoid the serious and take the light, perfunctorily finishing the matter. Even in this study, I kept thinking about why the higher-level criticized me. Wasn't I the only one making mistakes? Why not criticize others? I made many excuses for my own mistakes, and even suspected whether the leadership had any prejudice against me? It shouldn't be that one bad thing cancels out a hundred good things. At this time, the ideological struggle was very intense. I thought for a long time, combined with studying the relevant materials in the rectification documents, and pursued several "whys?" before realizing that this was not just a personal problem, but related to the Party's influence among the masses, damaging the Party's political prestige among the masses. This criticism is not only to educate me personally, but also to educate and alert all Party cadres. This is precisely the higher-level's care for me. In order to cure my illness, strict criticism should be carried out. If, as I thought, strict criticism was not carried out in order to save face, on the one hand, it would not make me realize the seriousness of my mistakes, and on the other hand, it would not educate everyone, and it would allow the second or even more people to continue to make such mistakes. Wouldn't this be harmful to the Party and the people? Chairman Mao taught us: "The Chinese Communists, who take the greatest interests of the overwhelming majority of the Chinese people as their point of departure, believe their cause to be perfectly just and are ready to sacrifice everything of their own, ever ready to lay down their lives to uphold the cause, so what erroneous ideas, views, opinions, or methods of work are there which we are reluctant to discard?" This reminded me. For the sake of personal face, I was unwilling to accept criticism. What a mistake this is! Because I improved my understanding in studying the documents and cleared my mind, I made a preliminary self-criticism of some serious erroneous tendencies in my work:

I have a bureaucratic work style. In the half year since arriving in Taiping, I am not familiar with the situation in the county, and I don't even understand the situation of the cadres. For example, Cheng Guantian's corruption and affairs with women were not promptly investigated and properly handled. Instead, he was transferred from district head to district party secretary. In my work, I gave many assignments but was not specific enough, and rarely organized forces to implement decisions and check the implementation of decisions. Many tasks were often only half-finished and then rarely followed up on, and I was satisfied with the reports and figures from below. For example, during the spring call for land reclamation, some villages emphasized collective land reclamation, and some women were unwilling to go, but were forced to go. As a result, land was reclaimed in response to the call, but not planted; in Gaocun, Yangxi District, more than 30 mu of paddy fields were abandoned. Another example is the call to plant cotton. The masses were not used to it, and we did not conduct key experiments or promote it in a focused way. At that time, the masses made excuses for not planting or planting less cotton by saying they had no cotton seeds. However, the county leadership did not seriously investigate and study this situation, but blindly sent people to buy cotton seeds. By the time the cotton seeds were bought back, the masses were busy transplanting rice seedlings, so they did not plant them. As a result, the cotton seeds were piled up in the district, and some had already rotted. This is completely a wasteful and irresponsible approach.

Commandism is seriously present. Because we cannot go deep among the masses to understand the situation, we often subjectively require the lower levels to complete tasks within a time limit, which is often impossible to achieve in practice. For example, we subjectively called on the masses to organize themselves for production, and the districts and villages immediately created rosters to organize the masses. Gantang Town even used compulsory orders to organize merchants into agricultural production groups, causing extreme dissatisfaction among the merchants and creating many concerns. Such production groups cannot play any role (Editor's note: Not only can they not play a role, but they also violate Article 34 of the Common Program: "... should guide farmers to gradually organize various forms of labor cooperation and production cooperation in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit." and Article 37: "Protect all legitimate public and private trade."). During the spring production and disaster relief, we called on everyone to carry out social mutual aid and free lending. However, most villages did not do this, so the district cadres used the method of calculating living expenses to force lending, without setting lending agreements or agreeing on interest rates. When I found out, I just sat in the office giving instructions and making phone calls to stop this illegal behavior, without seriously investigating and solving the problems of one village and one household to promote the correction of this mistake throughout the county. It is precisely because of serious commandism and individual heroism that I often cannot patiently persuade and concretely help comrades, but solve problems by criticizing and scolding. Sometimes, when discussing issues, I would get angry and criticize before others could finish speaking, making comrades afraid to approach me and afraid to report problems to me. How dangerous it is if this tendency of self-isolation and separation from the masses is not overcome! Usually, it is a bureaucratic, patriarchal leadership style. Big things are not done, and small things are not done well. For example, a comprehensive work plan for the entire county has not been made in half a year, and when summarizing work, we do not study policies or analyze the situation, causing various tasks to be passive.

In this rectification study, I correctly recognized the seriousness of my shortcomings and mistakes, and the harm to the interests of the Party and the people. I am determined to deeply examine myself. I hope that the higher-level Party, comrades, and especially the broad masses, will help me conduct an examination and transform my thinking so that I can do more work for the people.

### 从原谅自己错误到批评自己错误

　　从原谅自己错误到批评自己错误
    中共皖南太平县委书记  万振三
    整风学习对我帮助太大。从听了关于整风会议的传达以后，结合学习文件，检查自己，经过多次的思考和思想斗争，初步检讨如下：
    首先揭发了我不喜欢批评的毛病。由于小资产阶级爱面子，过去我总不愿互相批评，而愿意自我批评——在这种情况下的自我批评是不能将自己的思想问题全部暴露出来的；不愿在有群众的场合批评，而愿意在党内的会议上批评；不愿在文字上批评，而愿在口头上批评。更严重的是犯了错误或发现缺点后，往往是自己找些理由宽恕自己，并有以功臣自居的思想。比如去年六月底，我在青阳任县长时，为问案子打了一次人。打后自己也发现犯了错误，在“七一”党员大会上便做了自我检讨，在县委会上也做了检讨和批评。但由于思想上存在以上毛病，因此检讨、反省很不深刻，而是轻描淡写的支应过去。以后在地委文件上、区党委组织会议文件上看到了上级党委对我的批评后，我思想上又背起包袱，认为“我犯错误是事实，但我也做了一些工作吧！”“领导上不该不照顾我这点吧？”想借此向党、向人民讨价钱，掩蔽自己的错误和缺点，想避重就轻，支应过去完事。甚至在这次学习中，还翻来覆去的想着上级为什么要批评我，犯错误的也不能说就是我一个吧？为什么不批评别人呢？多方原谅自己的错误；并且怀疑到领导上是否对我有什么成见？也不该一事不好百事糟。这时思想斗争很激烈。我思考了很久，结合钻研了整风文件中的有关材料，又追究了几个为什么？才认识到这不是我个人问题，而是关系到党在群众中的影响，破坏了党在群众中的政治威信。这种批评不仅是为了教育我个人，同时为了教育和警惕全党干部。这正是上级对我的爱护。为了治好我的病，就应该进行严格的批评。假如照我所想的那样为照顾个人面子而不进行严格的批评，一方面不能使我认识自己错误的严重性，另一方面不能教育大家，还会让第二个甚至更多的人继续发生这样的错误，这不是有害于党与人民吗？毛主席教导我们：“以中国最广大人民的最大利益为出发点的中国共产党人，相信自己的事业是完全合乎正义的，不惜牺牲自己个人的一切，随时准备拿出自己的生命去殉我们的事业，难道我们还有甚么错误的不适合人民需要的思想，观点，意见，办法，舍不得丢掉的吗？”这一下可把我提醒了，为了个人的面子，竟不愿意批评，这是何等的错误。由于在学习文件中提高了认识，打通了思想，我初步检讨了自己工作中的一些严重错误倾向：
    我存在着官僚主义的工作作风。到太平半年来，对全县情况不熟悉，甚至干部情况都不了解，如程观天的贪污、搞女人，不但没有及时了解给予适当处理，反而把他从区长调任区委书记。工作上也是布置多而不具体，又很少组织力量去实现决定和检查决定的执行。许多工作往往做到半途便很少过问，而满足于下面的报告和数字。如今春号召开荒，有的村强调集体开荒，有些妇女不愿意去，但也被迫去开荒，结果造成为响应号召而开荒，开后不种；甚至如秧溪区高村反而荒掉三十余亩畈田。再如号召种棉花，群众无习惯，而我们也没有进行重点试验与重点推行。当时群众为了不种或少种，借口没有棉种。但是县领导上未认真调查研究此种情况，却盲目的派人去买棉种。等买回棉种时，群众也正忙于插秧，就没有种。结果棉籽都堆在区里，有的已经霉烂。这完全是劳民伤财，不负责任的作法。
    命令主义严重存在。由于我们不能深入群众了解情况，常是主观地要求下级限期完成，实际上常常无法实现。如主观地号召群众组织起来生产，各区、村即造了名册组织群众。甘棠镇甚至用强迫命令的方式把商人也组织到农业生产小组里去，致使商人极端不满。并由此产生了很多顾虑。这样的生产小组也就不能起什么作用（编者按：不但不能起作用，并且是违反共同纲领第三十四条：“……应引导农民逐步地按照自愿和互利的原则，组织各种形式的劳动互助和生产合作。”和第三十七条“保护一切合法的公私贸易。”）。春季生产救灾时，号召大家开展社会互济，进行自由借贷。但大部分村又没有这样做，于是区干部就用算生活账方式进行强迫借贷。并且不定借约和约订利息。我知道了，也只是坐在机关里发指示、打电话，阻止此种违法行为，并没有认真调查解决一村、一户的问题，来推动全县纠正这个错误。正由于严重的命令主义与个人英雄主义，对同志往往不能耐心说服、具体帮助；而用批评训斥的方式来解决问题。有时谈问题不等别人说完，就大发皮气，批评一顿，使得同志们不敢接近我，有问题不敢向我反映。这种自己封锁自己、脱离群众的倾向，如果再不克服是多么危险啊！平时则是事务主义家长式的领导方式，大事没有办，小事也办不好。如半年全县全面工作计划没有作，总结工作时也不研究政策，更不分析情况，致使各种工作处于被动。
    在这次整风学习中，使我正确认识了缺点和错误的严重，及对党、对人民利益的危害。我下定决心，要深刻的检讨自己。并希望上级党、同志们，特别是广大群众，帮助我进行检查，改造我的思想，使得为人民作更多的工作。
