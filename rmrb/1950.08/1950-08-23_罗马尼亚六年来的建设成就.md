　　Romania is an oil-producing country in the Balkan Peninsula, its oil production ranking fifth in the world; it is also the granary of Eastern Europe, its corn production ranking third in the world. However, in the old Romania under the rule of capitalists and landlords, the economy was backward. Before the war, monopoly capital from Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, and other countries almost entirely controlled Romania's oil industry, and the proportion of all industries in Romania's national economy was less than 40 percent, with heavy industry being particularly backward. In agriculture, poor and small farmers, who accounted for 80 percent of the agricultural population, owned only 36 percent of the arable land, suffering greatly from the exploitation of the large landlords, who accounted for less than 1 percent of the agricultural population. Agricultural production methods were primitive, with about half of the farmers lacking plows, and surplus labor in the countryside reaching 2.5 million.
　　During World War II, Romania suffered from the brutal plunder of the Hitlerite bandits. Before the Soviet army liberated Romania, it was deliberately bombed by American imperialists. After the Soviet army finally liberated Bucharest, the capital of Romania, on August 23, 1944, Romania's war losses were estimated at 110 trillion lei, equivalent to twelve years of fiscal expenditure before the war.
　　The liberated Romanian people, under the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party, established a people's democratic regime, successively implemented land reform, bank nationalization, and other laws, and began to restore the national economy from the ruins of war. During this period, the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries played a great role in Romania's economic recovery. The Soviet Union not only waived 60 million US dollars in war reparations and abandoned the designated grain as reparations, but also sent machinery and grain. Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria also sent large amounts of industrial equipment and grain to help the Romanian people overcome the great drought of 1945. Through the persevering efforts of the Romanian working people, by the end of 1947, industry had recovered to 75 percent of the pre-war level, and corn production had reached the pre-war level.
　　In December 1947, Romania abolished the monarchy and declared the establishment of the Romanian People's Republic. The consolidation of the people's democratic regime pushed economic construction to a new stage.
　　In 1948, Romania implemented the nationalization of industry, bringing 90 percent of large-scale industry under state ownership. After implementing short-term economic plans, Romania entered the period of planned economy in 1949. The two one-year plans implemented in succession over the past two years have enabled Romania's economy to develop rapidly.
　　During the period of Romania's economic construction, in addition to supplying raw materials such as machinery, mineral sand, and cotton through trade, the Soviet Union also helped Romania establish modern industry on the principle of equality through various Soviet-Romanian joint ventures established after the war. The Soviet-Romanian Oil Company completed 340,000 meters of well drilling in 1948. The Soviet-Romanian Metallurgical Company began the smelting of special steel for Romania, and the Soviet-Romanian Tractor Company produced the first Romanian-made tractor. In addition, the Soviet-Romanian Airlines and the Soviet-Romanian Transportation Company were supplied with transportation tools such as airplanes and ships by the Soviet Union, which promoted the development of Romania's transportation industry.
　　The economic cooperation between Romania and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria provided Romania with supplies of oil equipment, machinery, coke, and chemicals, enabling the economic construction work to achieve significant results in a short period of time.
　　At present, Romania's industrial production has greatly exceeded the pre-war level, and the proportion of industry in the national economy has exceeded 50 percent. By the end of this year, steel production will exceed more than double the pre-war level, electricity will exceed 40-50 percent, coal will exceed 37 percent, and oil production is approaching the pre-war level. The machinery manufacturing industry is producing machines that could not be produced before, such as oil extraction equipment, ball bearings, trucks, and tractors, etc. At the same time, light industry is also developing vigorously. This year, the production of cotton fabrics has increased by 70 percent compared with 1948, and meat has increased by 290 percent.
　　In agriculture, last year's grain production increased by 38 percent compared with 1948, and industrial crops increased by 48 percent. Due to the development of industry, agriculture has received an increasing amount of agricultural machinery and chemical fertilizers. There are now 108 machine tractor stations in Romania, with 4,500 tractors and various agricultural machines. From last autumn to this spring, farmers have established more than 100 collective farms, beginning to push agriculture onto the road of socialist transformation.
　　The success of economic construction has greatly improved the lives of the working people. Now, the real wages of workers have exceeded 30 percent of the pre-war level, and they universally enjoy free medical care, vacations, and social insurance. These benefits are equivalent to 20 percent of the average wage. Schools have been widely opened to the children of the working people. The number of primary school students has increased 24 times compared with before the war, the number of middle school students has increased seven times, and the number of university students has doubled.
　　Romania will begin implementing its first five-year plan in 1951. By the time the plan is completed, Romania will become an industrialized country, and national income will double compared with 1949; the standard of living will be raised by another 80 percent, and every village will receive electricity supply. The Romanian working people are full of confidence and are fighting for their happy prospects and for the victory of socialism. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　罗马尼亚六年来的建设成就
    罗马尼亚是巴尔干半岛上的石油国家，它的石油产量占世界第五位；它又是东欧的谷仓，它的玉蜀黍产量占世界第三位。但是，在过去资本家和地主统治下的旧罗马尼亚，经济上却是落后的。战前，英、法、荷、德、美等国的垄断资本，几乎全部控制了罗马尼亚的石油工业，而罗马尼亚的全部工业在国民经济中的比重，还不到百分之四十，重工业尤为落后。在农业中，占农业人口百分之八十的贫农和小农，仅占有耕地的百分之三十六，他们饱受占农业人口不到百分之一的大地主的剥削。农业生产方式是原始的，约有半数农民没有耕犁，农村中过剩劳动力曾达二百五十万。
    在第二次世界大战期间，罗马尼亚遭受了希特勒匪帮的残酷掠夺，到苏军解放罗马尼亚的前夕，又遭到美帝国主义者的蓄意轰炸。到一九四四年八月二十三日苏军最后解放了罗京布加勒斯特之后，估计罗马尼亚的战争损失，高达罗币一百一十万亿列伊，相当于战前十二年的财政支出。
    解放了的罗马尼亚人民，在罗马尼亚共产党领导下，建立了人民民主的政权，先后实施了土地改革，银行国有等法案，开始在战争的废墟上恢复国民经济。在这个期间，苏联和人民民主国家的友谊援助，对罗马尼亚的经济恢复起了伟大的作用。苏联不仅放弃了六十万美元的战争赔偿，放弃了指定作为赔偿的粮食，并送来了机器和谷物。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利和保加利亚等国，也送来了大量的工业装备和粮食，帮助罗马尼亚人民战胜了一九四五年间的大旱灾。在罗马尼亚劳动人民坚毅的努力下，到一九四七年年底，工业已恢复到战前水平的百分之七十五，玉蜀黍产量已达到了战前水平。
    一九四七年十二月，罗马尼亚废弃了帝制，宣告罗马尼亚人民共和国的成立。人民民主政权的巩固，把经济建设推上了新的阶段。
    一九四八年，罗马尼亚实行了工业国有化，把百分之九十的大工业收归国有。在实行了短期的经济计划之后，到一九四九年就进入了计划经济的时期。两年来相继执行的两个一年计划，使罗马尼亚的经济获得迅速的发展。
    在罗马尼亚进行经济建设的时期，苏联除通过贸易方式，供给机器、矿沙和棉花等原料之外，并通过在战后成立的各种苏罗合营公司，在平等的原则上，帮助罗马尼亚建立了现代的工业。苏罗石油公司在一九四八年完成了三十四万米的凿井工作。苏罗冶金公司为罗马尼亚开始了特种钢的冶炼，苏罗拖拉机公司出产了罗马尼亚造的第一部拖拉机。此外，苏罗航空公司和苏罗运输公司都由苏联供给了飞机轮船等运输工具，推动了罗马尼亚运输业的发展。
    罗马尼亚和波、捷、匈、保各人民民主国家的经济合作，使罗马尼亚得到了石油装备、机器、焦炭和化学品的供应，使经济建设工作能在短期内获得重大成就。
    现在，罗马尼亚的工业生产，已大大超过战前水平，工业在国民经济中的比重超过了百分之五十。到本年年底，钢铁产量将超过战前水平的一倍以上，电力将超过百分之四十——五十，煤炭将超过百分之三十七，石油生产已接近战前水平。机器制造业正生产着以前所不能生产的机器，如开采石油的装备、球轴承、卡车和拖拉机等等。同时，轻工业也在蓬勃发展中。今年，棉织品的产量已较一九四八年增加了百分之七十，肉类增加了百分之二百九十。
    在农业方面，去年谷物产量比一九四八年增加了百分之三十八，工业作物增加了百分之四十八。由于工业的发展，农业已得到了日益增加的农业机器和化学肥料。现在罗马尼亚已有一百零八个机器拖拉机站，拥有四千五百辆拖拉机和各种农业机器。从去年秋天到今年春天，农民们已经建立了一百多所集体农场，开始把农业推向社会主义改造的道路。
    经济建设的成功，已使劳动人民的生活大为改善。现在工人的实际工资已超过了战前百分之三十，并且普遍地享受到免费医疗、休假和社会保险。这些福利，相当于平均工资的百分之二十。学校已广泛地为劳动人民的子女开放。小学生人数较战前增加了二十四倍，中学生增加了七倍，大学生增加了一倍。
    罗马尼亚将在一九五一年开始实行第一个五年计划。到计划完成时，罗马尼亚将成为一个工业化的国家，国民收入将比一九四九年增加一倍；生活水准将再提高百分之八十，每一个村庄都将获得电力供应。罗马尼亚劳动人民正满怀信心地为自己的幸福远景，为社会主义的胜利而斗争着。（新华社）
