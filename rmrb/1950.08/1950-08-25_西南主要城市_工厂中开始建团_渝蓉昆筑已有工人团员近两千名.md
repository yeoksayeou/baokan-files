    Construction of Communist Youth League Begins in Factories

    Nearly Two Thousand Worker Members in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming and Guiyang

    【Xinhua News Agency, 21st】Factories in major cities in the Southwest have begun to establish organizations of the New Democratic Youth League. According to incomplete statistics at the end of June, there were 1,908 young worker members in Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming and Guiyang. Youth League organizations have been established in major state-owned factories.

    The work of building the Youth League in factories in major cities in the Southwest began in late April and early May this year. Local Youth League committees mostly developed young worker members through worker training courses or factory work teams. The Chongqing Municipal Working Committee of the Youth League sent cadres to the 21st Arsenal to run a training course for young workers, absorbing 347 young workers from seven larger factories nearby to participate in the study. Three weeks later, 286 young workers joined the Youth League. At present, 25 factories in the city have established Youth League organizations, with 924 young workers joining the Youth League and 412 applying. The Guiyang Municipal Working Committee of the Youth League developed 188 Youth League members in the first and second phases of worker training courses run by the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions. In Kunming, there were two progressive underground organizations before liberation: the Yunnan New Democratic Workers' League and the Yunnan New Democrats' League. After liberation, the Kunming Municipal Working Committee of the Youth League organized two work teams to handle the procedures for young workers from the two leagues to join the Youth League in various factories. By the end of May, 510 people from seven state-owned factories had joined the League.

    【新华社二十一日讯】西南主要城市的工厂已开始建立新民主主义青年团的组织。据六月底的不完全统计，重庆、成都、昆明、贵阳四市已有青年工人团员一千九百零八名，在主要公营工厂中都建立了青年团的组织。
    西南主要城市的工厂建团工作，在今年四月末至五月初开始。各地团委多半通过工人训练班或工厂工作组等方式发展青年工人团员。青年团重庆市工作委员会曾派干部到二十一兵工厂举办青年工人训练班，吸收了附近七个较大工厂三百四十七名青年工人参加学习。三个星期后，就有二百八十六名青年工人加入了青年团。现全市已有二十五个工厂建立了青年团的组织，有九百二十四名青年工人加入青年团，并有四百一十二名在申请中。贵阳市青年团工作委员会在省总工会开办的一、二期工人训练班中发展团员达一百八十八名。昆明市在解放前即有云南新民主主义工人联盟和云南新民主主义者联盟两个进步的地下组织。解放后，昆明市青年团工作委员会即组织两个工作组到各厂办理两个联盟的青年工人入团手续。到五月底止，七个公营工厂已有五百一十人入团。
