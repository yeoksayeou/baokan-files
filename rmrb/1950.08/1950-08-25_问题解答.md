Question and Answer

    Question: In water conservancy, we often hear "flow rate of so many cubic meters per second." What exactly is "flow rate"? How is it calculated? (Proposed by Tian Liren)
    Answer: The "flow rate" of a river channel refers to the number of cubic meters of water flowing through a cross-section of the river channel per second. This volume of water is called the "flow rate." If we use a formula to express it, we can first take a cross-section of the river channel, with its area represented by B, and the average flow velocity of the water at that point represented by C (which is the distance the water flows in one second). Then the flow rate formula is A = B x C. A represents the flow rate, measured in cubic meters per second; B is measured in square meters; C is measured in meters per second. This is the basic formula for water flow rate. If you want to find the flow rate at a certain point in a river channel, you must measure the cross-sectional area of the flowing water and the average flow velocity of the water at that point, and the product of the two is the flow rate.

    Question: What is meant by "rainfall intensity"? (Proposed by Li Wenhan)
    Answer: "Rainfall intensity," also known as "rain density," indicates the amount of rainfall within a unit of time. For example, if a rainstorm drops a certain depth of water within a certain hour at a certain location, this indicates the rainfall intensity of that rainstorm at that location during that hour. Rainstorms last for a short time but have a high rainfall intensity; ordinary rains that last for a long time have a low rainfall intensity.

    Question: We often hear the term "Divert the Yellow River to benefit the Wei River." What does this mean? (Proposed by Zhou Youshou)
    Answer: "Diverting the Yellow River to benefit the Wei River" is a significant Yellow River water conservancy project. It has two purposes: one is for irrigation, planning to irrigate approximately 400,000 mu of farmland in the four counties of Jixian, Xinxiang, Huojia, and Yanjin in Pingyuan Province; the other is to benefit the Wei River, increasing the water source of the Wei River to improve navigation between Xinxiang and Tianjin. The water diversion point for this project is on the northwest bank of the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Jinghan Railway, where a gate will be built to divert water. The main canal runs from the water intake gate to the Wei River bank in Xinxiang for a length of more than fifty kilometers, with a canal water volume of 40 cubic meters per second. On both sides of the main canal, east and west branch canals are dug and repaired, each approximately thirty kilometers long, with a water volume of 14 cubic meters per second, each canal irrigating approximately 200,000 mu of farmland. In terms of benefiting the Wei River, it is planned to input 17 cubic meters per second of water into the Wei River, so that the Wei River will always maintain a water volume of 20 cubic meters per second, in order to facilitate the navigation of 200-ton steamers. This project has been surveyed and designed, and construction will begin in October of this year, with the entire project expected to be completed by the end of 1951.

    Question: What is meant by water level? (Proposed by Wang Yiping)
    Answer: Water level refers to the height of the water surface above a certain benchmark at a certain location and time in a river, i.e., the height above the benchmark sea level. For example, the rivers in North China use the Dagu zero point as the benchmark. If the water level at the Lugouqiao station of the Yongding River on August 20th is 61.80 meters, it means that it is 61.80 meters above the Dagu zero point. Other rivers such as those in Northeast China use the Dalian or Qinhuangdao zero point as the benchmark; the Yellow River uses the Qingdao zero point as the benchmark in Shandong Province, and the Dagu zero point for the rest; the Yangtze River uses the Wusong zero point as the benchmark; the Huai River uses the abandoned Yellow River mouth zero point as the benchmark; the Pearl River uses the zero point of the Guangxi Land Survey Bureau as the benchmark; and some use an assumed zero point as the benchmark. The rise and fall of the water level indicates the changes in the river and the increase or decrease in its flow rate. Because the water level is closely related to water control projects, the recording and measurement of water levels is one of the basic tasks of water conservancy.

　　问题解答
    问：在水利上常常听到“流量多少秒立方公尺”，究竟“流量”是什么？如何计算法？ 
  （田立人提）
    答：一个河道的“流量”，就是指在河道某一个横断面，每秒钟内有多少立方公尺的水流过去，这个体积的水，便叫作“流量”。如用公式来表示，可先取河道的某一横断面，它的面积用乙来代表，该处水的平均流速用丙来表示（就是一秒钟时间水流的路程）那末它的流量公式就是甲等于乙乘丙。甲表示流量，以秒立方公尺计；乙以平方公尺计；丙以秒公尺计。这是水的流量的基本公式。如欲求一个河道某一地点的流量，就必须在那个定点，测得流水的断面积和水的平均流速，二者相乘之积即得。

    问：什么叫做“雨的降率”？  
   （李文汉提）
    答：“雨的降率”，也称作“雨的密度”，是表示在一个单位时间内所降的雨量。例如某次暴雨，在某点钟的时间内降了多少深的水，这就表示某次降雨在某点钟的降率。暴雨历时很短，而降率大；普通历时长久的雨，降率反低。

    问：常闻“引黄济卫”一词，这是什么意思？
    （周有寿提）
    答：“引黄济卫”是一个不小的引黄水利工程。其目的有两个：一个是为了灌溉，计划浇灌平原省汲县、新乡、获嘉，及延津四县农田约四十万亩；一个是为了济卫，增加卫河水源，以增进新乡至天津间的航运。该工程引水地点，在京汉路黄河铁桥以西北岸，筑闸引水。总干渠，自进水闸至新乡卫河边止长五十余公里，渠水量为四○秒立方公尺。总干渠两侧，分别挖修东西干渠，长各约三十公里，水量为十四秒立方公尺，每渠灌田约二十万亩。济卫方面，计划输入卫河水量十七秒立方公尺，使卫河经常保持二十秒立方公尺的水量，以便航行二百吨汽船。此项工程，业经测设完毕，今年十月间即开始施工，预计一九五一年底全部完成。

    问：什么叫水位？
   （王亦平提）
    答：水位系指江河在某一地点，某一时间，水面高出某一基准面之尺度而言，亦即高出基准海面的尺度。例如，华北各河以大沽零点为基准，八月二十日永定河芦沟桥站水位为六一·八○公尺，即谓高出大沽零点六一·八○公尺。余如东北各河以大连或秦皇岛零点为基准；黄河除山东省以青岛零点为基准外，余以大沽零点为基准；长江以吴淞零点为基准；淮河以废黄河口零点为基准；珠江以广西陆地测量局零点为基准；亦有以假定零点为基准的。水位的升降是表示河流的变化和其流量的增减的，水位因为与治水工事息息相关，所以水位的记载与测验为水利基本工作之一。
