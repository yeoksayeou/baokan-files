　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd: TASS, New York, 1st: The United Nations Secretariat has informed reporters that United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has received a letter from Soviet Union Representative to the United Nations Malik on July 31st, listing the agenda for the Security Council meeting on August 1st. The Soviet representative demanded: "Notify all Security Council member states that a Security Council meeting will be held at 3:00 PM (New York time) on August 1st. The agenda of the meeting is as follows: (1) Adoption of the agenda; (2) The case of recognizing the representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as the representative of China; (3) The case of peacefully resolving the Korean issue."
　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 2nd: TASS, New York, 2nd: The Security Council held a meeting on August 1st, with Soviet Representative Malik serving as chairman.
　　Before beginning the discussion of the agenda, Malik issued a statement saying that he, in his capacity as chairman, ruled that the presence of the Kuomintang representative as the representative of China was illegal.
　　After a brief discussion, Malik's ruling was put to a vote and was rejected by a majority vote against it, with three votes in favor. In addition to the Soviet Union, India and Yugoslavia voted in favor of this decision.
　　A debate arose over the calculation of the vote.
　　Malik pointed out that the vote of the Kuomintang representative could not be counted because the issue being voted on was his presence. U.S. Representative Austin opposed this.
　　Malik, in his capacity as the Soviet representative, declared that the Security Council's decision was illegal because the decision referred to the representative of a clique, rather than the representative of a country that could be an equal member of the United Nations.
　　However, the U.S. representative continued to object in an improper manner. He demanded that the chairman should adopt a manner of presiding over the meeting, and not make arbitrary rulings.
　　Malik protested against this unacceptable behavior of the U.S. representative, asking him to abide by the rules. Then, he announced that the vote of the Kuomintang representative, who had no right to vote, was included in the count, with eight votes against the chairman's ruling.
　　Malik declared again that this decision was illegal.
　　After discussing the chairman's ruling that the Kuomintang representative's participation in the Security Council was illegal, Malik announced the preliminary agenda, the first item of which was the issue of recognizing the representative of the People's Republic of China as the representative of China, and the second item of which was the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
　　In contrast, U.S. Representative Austin demanded that the Security Council should take the U.S. delegation's proposal against North Korea as the first item on the Security Council's agenda.
　　The Security Council meeting was adjourned to the 2nd. No resolution was passed regarding the agenda.

　　苏代表马立克提出安理会议程
    要求讨论承认我国代表及和平解决朝鲜问题
    美代表操纵多数非法为国民党匪帮保留席次
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约一日讯：联合国秘书处顷告各报记者称：联合国秘书长赖伊已接到苏联驻联合国代表马立克七月三十一日来信一件，其中开列安理会八月一日会议的议程。苏联代表要求：“通知所有安理会理事国，定于八月一日下午三时（纽约时间）召开安理会会议。会议议程如下：（一）通过议程案；（二）承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表为中国的代表案；（三）和平解决朝鲜问题案。”
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约二日讯：安理会于八月一日举行会议，苏联代表马立克担任主席。
    马立克在开始讨论议程以前发表声明称：他以主席的资格决定国民党代表以中国代表的资格出席是非法的。
    经简短的讨论后，马立克的裁决提付表决，多数票反对，三票赞成，遂遭否决。除了苏联之外，印度与南斯拉夫投票赞成这一决定。
    关于投票的计算问题发生了辩论。
    马立克指出：国民党代表的票不能算数，因为表决的问题就是他的出席问题。美国代表奥斯汀反对这一点。
    马立克以苏联代表的资格声明：安理会这个决定是非法的，因为这个决定所指的是一个集团的代表，而不是可以作为联合国平等一员的国家的代表。
    但是，美国代表仍然以不正当的态度继续反对。他要求主席应当采取主持会议的态度，不要独断地裁决。
    马立克对美国代表这种不能容许的行为提出抗议，要他遵守规则。然后，他宣布将无权投票的国民党代表的票计算在内，有八票反对主席的裁决。
    马立克再次声明：这一决定是非法的。
    在讨论了主席所作国民党代表参加安理会为非法的这一裁决之后，马立克宣布初步议程，这一议程的第一项是承认中华人民共和国代表为中国代表的问题，第二项是和平解决朝鲜问题。
    与此相反，美国代表奥斯汀要求安理会应该把美国代表团所提出的反对北朝鲜的提案作为安理会议程之第一项。
    安理会会议延至二日举行。关于议程没有通过任何决议。
