The report made by Chairman Mao Zedong at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on June 6th this year, and the eight tasks he put forward, as well as the various reports and resolutions passed by the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, are fully in line with the situation in the Southwest. The various tasks outlined in these reports and resolutions are the tasks of the entire Southwest region. Governments at all levels and all the people in the Southwest should strive for their thorough realization.

In the past six months, all aspects of work in the Southwest have been successful. The current basic situation is as follows:

	Tibet is still awaiting liberation.

	In other areas, the rampant activities of bandits and secret agents that were prevalent after liberation have been dealt a fatal blow. Most areas have been purified, but they are still active in the border mountainous areas and need to be continuously cleared.

	Although prices have been stabilized, the financial and economic situation has not yet fundamentally improved. Expenditures cannot be reduced temporarily, while the collection of public grain has only reached 60% of the 1949 level, tax revenue has only reached 21.5% of the annual plan, and public bonds have only reached 74%. Therefore, the deficit is huge, and it still relies on central subsidies. If efforts are not stepped up in terms of income, this situation will be difficult to continue. Due to our efforts in economic work, the adjustment of relations between public and private industry and commerce has been effective, the market has begun to become active, urban and rural exchanges have begun to flow smoothly, the RMB has begun to go to the countryside, and the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has begun construction. The entire industry and commerce has shown signs of improvement. However, public and private industrial and commercial enterprises still face many difficulties. Only a few state-owned enterprises have started operations, and most are still in a state of maintenance. The conditions for the restoration and development of private industrial and commercial enterprises still need to be created. Rural handicrafts and sideline businesses have suffered severe damage under the long-term oppression and exploitation of reactionary rule, and the government urgently needs to support them.

	Farmers have been preliminarily organized and mobilized. They have been trapped in extreme poverty under the long-term oppression and exploitation of feudal reactionary rule, and urgently demand rent reduction, interest reduction, return of deposits, and implementation of land reform, and to be liberated from the rule of local tyrants and landlords.

	Urban workers who have lost their jobs need to be properly relieved and resettled, and the vast unemployed masses in society need to seek a way out in the recovery and development of the economy. Recently, there has been a summer famine in rural areas, and relief is urgently needed.

	Minority nationalities warmly welcome and support the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. The work of uniting minority nationalities needs to be strengthened.

	Other tasks, such as convening people's representative conferences at all levels, consolidating and expanding the united front, and cultural and educational work, have achieved preliminary results and must continue to be worked hard on.

In response to the above situation, the main tasks of our Southwest region should be:

	First, liberate Tibet and consolidate the national defense of the Southwest.

	The People's Liberation Army is about to march into Tibet, the purpose of which is to drive out the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism, to bring the Tibetan people back to the big family of the People's Republic of China, and to consolidate the national defense of the western border. After the People's Liberation Army enters Tibet, it will implement the principle of regional autonomy for the Tibetan nationality in accordance with Chapter VI of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, implement freedom of religious belief, protect lama temples, respect the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people, develop the Tibetan language and writing and school education, develop Tibetan agriculture, animal husbandry, industry and commerce, and improve the people's living standards. All existing political and military systems in Tibet will remain as they are and will not be changed. Officials at all levels will continue to perform their duties as usual. The existing Tibetan army will become part of the national defense armed forces of the People's Republic of China. All reforms related to Tibet will be resolved entirely based on the will of the Tibetan people and through consultations between the Tibetan people and Tibetan leaders. As for officials who were pro-imperialist and pro-Kuomintang in the past, as long as they break away from the relationship with imperialism and the Kuomintang and do not engage in sabotage and resistance, they will all continue to serve and will not be held accountable for the past. All expenses of the People's Liberation Army after entering Tibet will be fully provided by the Central People's Government in order to reduce the burden on the Tibetan people.

	Now imperialism is trying its best to prevent the Tibetan people from returning to the big family of the motherland and to prevent the delegation of the Tibetan authorities from going to Beijing to negotiate a reasonable solution to the Tibetan issue, because this is detrimental to imperialism and beneficial to the motherland and the Tibetan people. We hope that the Tibetan authorities will resolutely break away from the control of imperialism, directly contact the People's Liberation Army on the front line, and jointly drive the imperialist aggressor forces out of Tibet. The people of the Southwest should do everything possible to support the People's Liberation Army that is liberating Tibet.

	Second, continue to eliminate bandits and secret agents and consolidate revolutionary order.

	The bandit suppression work in the past six months has achieved remarkable results. However, since the political nature of the bandits in the Southwest is particularly obvious and they rely on deeply rooted feudal forces, they cannot be ignored. In the border mountainous areas where bandits are still active, we should continue to vigorously suppress them. In areas that have been preliminarily purified, we should continue to eliminate the hidden remnants of bandits and prevent them from rising again on the basis of organizing and mobilizing the masses and arming the people for bandit defense and self-defense.

	In our bandit suppression, we should continue to implement the policy of combining leniency with suppression, that is, the ringleaders must be dealt with, the coerced will not be held accountable, and those who make meritorious service will be rewarded. We should continue to implement the principle of giving priority to politics and supplementing it with military affairs. The error of not dealing with the ringleaders that was committed in some areas of the Southwest in the previous period has been corrected. During the bandit suppression period, the authority to approve the death penalty should still belong to the provincial chairman, administrative office director, and the special commissioner entrusted by the provincial chairman and administrative office director. Unauthorized acts without approval and without court judgment are strictly prohibited.

	After the open activities of secret agents and bandits are suppressed, they will inevitably turn to activities mainly based on hidden struggles. At any time, we must strengthen the work of the public security department and the education of the people against bandits and secret agents. It is particularly important to strengthen economic security work and strictly prevent the enemy from sabotaging.

	Third, implement the campaign against local bullies, rent reduction, return of deposits, and prepare for the implementation of land reform.

	Article 27 of the Common Program clearly stipulates: "Land reform is a necessary condition for the development of productivity and national industrialization. In areas where land reform has been implemented, the ownership of land already obtained by farmers must be protected. In areas where land reform has not yet been implemented, it is necessary to mobilize the peasant masses, establish peasant organizations, and achieve the goal of 'land to the tiller' through steps such as eliminating bandits and local bullies, reducing rent and interest, and distributing land." The people of the Southwest must strive for the thorough implementation of this provision of the Common Program and the Land Reform Law promulgated by the Central People's Government on June 30th this year.

	In the Southwest region, especially in Sichuan, land is very concentrated. The process by which warlords, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry and other feudal forces concentrated land through trickery and plunder was also the process by which farmers went bankrupt and unemployed. Farmers urgently demand land and to be liberated from the rule of landlords and local bullies. However, since the Southwest was liberated relatively late, the feudal forces are particularly strong, and the masses have not been universally mobilized and organized, the conditions for implementing land reform have not yet been prepared. Therefore, during the coming winter and spring, we should focus on eliminating bandits, opposing local bullies, and reducing rent. This step can not only preliminarily relieve the suffering of farmers and create preliminary conditions for the restoration and development of industry, agriculture, and commerce, but also lay a solid foundation for the land reform movement that will begin in the winter after next spring.

	The Southwest Military and Political Committee promulgated the Rent Reduction Regulations on March 10, and these regulations are still applicable.

	Rent reduction itself is a serious class struggle. If the rule of the local bullies of the feudal class is not overthrown, if the peasant masses are not fully mobilized, and if the tenancy rights of the peasants are not guaranteed, the result will inevitably be the widespread occurrence of phenomena such as rent reduction in name only, or adding before reducing. At the same time, the evil landlords and secret agents will do everything possible to sabotage rumors, create chaos, and even organize so-called "guerrilla warfare" in order to sabotage the rent reduction. Therefore, eliminating bandits and opposing local bullies is an indispensable part of the rent reduction movement. The farmers' association committees at all levels elected by the farmers' representative conferences are the legal organs of power to lead the anti-bullying and rent reduction movement.

	The anti-bullying and rent reduction movement, like land reform, must be carried out in a prepared, step-by-step, and orderly manner, so as not to hinder production and cause chaos, and also not to be exploited by the enemy to sabotage the rent reduction movement. Therefore, the rent reduction regulations must be widely studied among cadres, farmers, and landlords. Whether during the preparation period or during the implementation period, random beating, random killing, random arrest, and random fines must be strictly prohibited. The purpose of anti-bullying is to overthrow the feudal political rule in the countryside and ensure the smooth progress of the rent reduction movement. Therefore, we should adopt the method of reasoning and basing on the law to prevent the mistake of too wide a scope of attack. For the bully elements who are willing to compensate the masses for their losses in accordance with the law and repent of their mistakes, they should be given a way to start anew and live. There is no need to fight everyone. All bully cases and landlords who resist rent reduction should be handed over to the people's court for judgment, and should not be directly handled by mass meetings. The people's governments of various counties should organize mobile people's courts to cooperate with the anti-bullying and rent reduction movement in rural areas.

	In the struggle against bullying and rent reduction, industry and commerce must be properly protected and must not be damaged or infringed. At the same time, rent reduction work must be consistent with the provisions of the Land Reform Law, and any violations of the Land Reform Law should be corrected and stopped.

	Fourth, restore and develop the economy and continue to adjust industry and commerce.

	At present, the economic work in the Southwest focuses on striving for a faster recovery, and at the same time seeking the construction and development of certain necessary undertakings on the basis of recovery.

	Southwest industry has a considerable foundation, but it must be transformed to meet the needs of new democratic construction. At present, both public and private enterprises are still in a transitional period of starting to overcome difficulties. According to the industrial characteristics of the Southwest, only by striving for the operation of state-owned enterprises can private enterprises be driven to improve. Due to the current financial difficulties of the country and market conditions, state-owned enterprises can only be restored with emphasis for the time being, and the emphasis is on the restoration and construction of transportation undertakings. Our strength can only be concentrated on doing one or two things well, and we must never do everything at once, so as not to end up accomplishing nothing. The start of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has driven the restoration of some public and private enterprises and has also brought us hope. Our difficulties are temporary and are being gradually overcome. We still have to endure a period of difficulty, but we should be good at preparing conditions for improvement in the midst of difficulties. Both public and private enterprises must earnestly improve management and reduce costs. In state-owned enterprises, establish an economic accounting system and a democratic factory management system; in private enterprises, establish correct labor-capital relations based on democratic, equal, and mutually beneficial contracts, establish labor-capital consultation meetings, and overcome the passive emotions of some manufacturers, in order to overcome difficulties and lay the foundation for future development.

	The adjustment of the relationship between public and private industry and commerce has achieved preliminary results and should continue to be implemented to facilitate the development of production. The work of guiding some industrial and commercial enterprises to change industries and overcome anarchic production should also be carefully studied and implemented.

	In agriculture, we must make every effort to maintain the original production level, not to reduce it, and on this basis, restore and develop it, and strive to exceed the pre-war level in a few years. We should vigorously protect and promote the production of industrial raw materials and export materials such as cotton, hemp, sugar, tung oil, bristles, tea, and tobacco leaves. All matters related to the development of agricultural, animal husbandry, and forestry production, such as building water conservancy projects, digging ponds, ensuring irrigation, increasing fertilization, improving agricultural tools and seeds, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, protecting forests, planting trees and afforestation, and breeding livestock, must be implemented in the regular work of governments at all levels and farmers' associations, and farmers should be led and organized to carry out these activities in a planned and step-by-step manner.

	The People's Government should protect rural handicrafts and sideline occupations and prevent them from being destroyed. Those with prospects should also be assisted to make appropriate development.

	At present, we have too little economic material on the Southwest, and the research is also very insufficient, so it is difficult to make an overall economic construction plan for the time being. However, based on the existing economic materials and in accordance with the central construction plan, we should carry out various construction matters in a relatively planned manner in order to save manpower and financial resources and avoid detours.

	Fifth, strive to balance revenue and expenditure and continue to stabilize prices.

	Price stability in recent months has won the support and support of the people, but speculators are still waiting for an opportunity to move. Recently, due to the war of aggression against Korea provoked by US imperialism, speculators have begun to move again. Therefore, state-owned trading institutions must strengthen their business, prepare sufficient strength, and give speculators the punishment they deserve, so that the already stable prices will remain stable for a long time.

	The reliable basis for stabilizing prices lies in the balance of national fiscal revenue and expenditure. In this regard, our Southwest region should redouble its efforts.

	The task of collecting public grain in 1949 is far from complete, and we must continue to work hard. Counties and districts that have completed more than 75% should come to an end and turn to the stage of clearing up arrears. The principle of clearing is: all poor farmers who have not paid will be exempted; all arrears of landlords and rich peasants that are indeed beyond their ability to bear, or the number they bear exceeds the regulations of the Government Council, should be reduced; all landlords and rich peasants whose number they bear has not exceeded the regulations of the Government Council, but only have temporary difficulties, may be allowed to give IOU and pay them after the autumn harvest; all those who should pay and can pay but take resistant behavior should be handed over to the people's court for punishment, and the phenomenon of random beating and random arrest should be prohibited from continuing.

	The autumn grain collection for 1950 should be based on the regulations of the Central People's Government, and the principle should be that it does not exceed 13% of the total output. All localities should start now to do a good job of investigation and preparation, and avoid repeating the unevenness and other errors and shortcomings caused by unfamiliarity with the situation, poor methods, and insufficient cadres this time.

	Tax revenue performance is even worse than public grain, and in balancing revenue and expenditure to solve financial difficulties, the completion of tax revenue is even more important than public grain. Therefore, in the future, the financial department should gradually shift its focus to tax work. On the one hand, in accordance with the central regulations, it should resolutely adjust the unreasonable parts of past tax revenue; on the other hand, it must strengthen the tax revenue agency, train tax revenue cadres, simplify tax revenue administration, and resolutely struggle against the serious phenomenon of tax evasion. According to the tax rate stipulated by the central government, it is not allowed to collect more, nor is it allowed to collect less. This is the principle that our tax cadres must abide by.

	Sixth, carry out reorganization and demobilization work and reduce financial expenditure.

	The reorganization work in various parts of the Southwest has come to an end, and tens of thousands of surplus personnel have been properly handled.

	Now the People's Liberation Army is carrying out partial demobilization work. A large number of demobilized soldiers in the Southwest region will be sent back to their hometowns in the Southwest or all over the country for production after full mobilization and education. Other major administrative regions will also have a large number of demobilized soldiers sent back to their hometowns in the Southwest for production. This is a huge organizational and educational task. The People's Liberation Army has determined that all demobilized soldiers must have a home to return to and be willing to return to their hometowns for production, and they must all undergo one to two months of special education, so that they can automatically abide by government laws, work hard in production, and work hard after returning home. The People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government and the Government Council have determined to issue a considerable amount of food to demobilized personnel to help demobilized personnel solve their temporary living difficulties and smoothly transfer to production. Our governments at all levels, people's organizations, and the people of the entire region must attach importance to this work, warmly welcome the returning soldiers under the leadership of the demobilization work committees at all levels, and help them solve the difficulties in transferring to production.

	Reorganization and demobilization work will reduce a considerable amount of financial expenditure, so as to save funds for investment in economic construction and appropriately reduce the burden on the people.

	The current central task of the People's Liberation Army is to suppress bandits and carry out partial demobilization work. After these two tasks are completed, the People's Liberation Army will follow the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and in addition to a part of them taking on the country's economic construction, they will all turn to the great education stage mainly based on culture, so that within three years, the soldiers will reach the level of graduating from high school, and the cadres will reach the level of graduating from junior high school or above. This will greatly improve the quality of the people's army and strengthen the national defense.

	Seventh, overcome disasters and relieve unemployed workers.

	Since the beginning of summer, sporadic disasters have occurred in various places, and they are more serious in poor mountainous areas, areas where bandits are active, and areas that have traditionally relied on sideline occupations and handicrafts as their main source of livelihood. Governments at all levels must attach importance to this issue, and no matter how big or small the disaster is, it must be quickly overcome to prevent it from developing and to ensure that no one starves to death. Disaster relief should adopt the principle of relying mainly on self-help through production, supplemented by the organization of social mutual assistance and national subsidies, and it is not appropriate to adopt the method of purely relief by allocating grain from the state. We should encourage free lending in rural areas, with interest rates negotiated by both parties, to ensure that there are loans and repayments, so that the victims can tide over the difficulties. The government should allocate sufficient grain, in addition to implementing emergency relief for some, it will be mainly used for production loans, and lead and organize the victims to produce. State-owned trading institutions should especially purchase a large amount of products from the victims to cooperate with the disaster relief plan. All governments and people's organizations in areas where the disaster is severe should focus their work on disaster relief. The bandit suppression work in disaster areas must be combined with the disaster relief work in order to unite the masses and eliminate banditry.

	The work of relieving unemployed workers has begun in major cities, with 20,000 people participating in railway construction projects, and some have been placed in various ways in various places. Relieving unemployed workers is our political responsibility, and the Central People's Government has made appropriate provisions for this, and we must implement it with a serious and responsible attitude.

### 西南区的工作任务  刘伯承主席在西南军政委员会首次全体委员会议上的报告

　　西南区的工作任务
    刘伯承主席在西南军政委员会首次全体委员会议上的报告
    今年六月六日，毛泽东主席在中共三中全会的报告及其所提出的八项任务，人民政协全国委员会第二次会议所通过的各项报告和决议，完全符合于西南的情况。这些报告及决议所示的各项任务，就是西南全区的任务，西南各级政府和全体人民应为求其彻底实现而努力。
    半年来，西南各方面工作都是有成绩的，现在的基本情况是：
    西藏还待解放。
    其他地区在解放后曾经猖獗一时的土匪特务活动，已受到致命打击。大部地区业已净化，但在边沿山地，仍然活跃，需要继续努力加以肃清。
    物价虽已稳定，但财政经济情况尚未获得基本好转。开支暂时不能减少，而公粮征收仅达一九四九年度的百分之六十，税收仅达全年计划百分之二一点五，公债仅达百分之七四，故赤字浩大，目前仍赖中央补助，此种情况如不在收入方面加紧努力，很难继续下去。由于我们在经济工作方面的努力，调整公私工商业关系已见成效，市场开始活跃，城乡内外交流开始疏畅，人民币开始下乡，成渝铁路开始兴筑，整个工商业已显现好转的端倪。但公私工商业困难仍多，国业企业只有少数开工，绝大部分还在维持状态；私营工商业恢复和发展的条件，尚待继续创造。农村手工业和副业在长期反动统治压榨下，遭受到严重的破坏，极待政府予以扶植。
    农民已有初步的组织和发动。他们在长期的封建反动统治的压迫剥削之下，已陷于极端贫困的地步，迫切要求减租减息，退押和实行土地改革，并从恶霸地主统治下解放出来。
    城市工人失业需要妥善地加以救济和安置，社会上的广大失业群众需要在经济的恢复和发展中谋求出路。最近在农村中发生夏荒现象，急需进行救济。
    少数民族热烈的欢迎和拥护人民政府和人民解放军。团结少数民族工作尚待加强。
    他如召开各界人民代表会议，巩固和扩大统一战线，以及文化教育等项工作，已获初步成绩，仍须继续努力。
    针对上述情况，我们西南区的主要工作任务应该是：
  第一、解放西藏，巩固西南国防。
    人民解放军即将进军西藏，其目的在于将英美帝国主义侵略势力驱逐出去。使西藏人民回到中华人民共和国祖国的大家庭来，并巩固西陲国防。人民解放军进入西藏之后，将一本人民政协共同纲领第六章之原则，实行西藏民族区域自治，实行宗教自由，保护喇嘛寺庙，尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯；发展西藏民族的语言文字和学校教育；发展西藏的农牧工商各业，改善人民生活。西藏现行各种政治制度和军事制度，均维持原状，不予变更；各级官员照常供职；西藏现有军队成为中华人民共和国国防武装之一部分。有关西藏的各项改革事宜，完全依据西藏人民的意志，由西藏人民及西藏领导人员采取协商方式解决。对于过去亲帝国主义和亲国民党的官员，只要他们脱离帝国主义和国民党的关系，不进行破坏和反抗，一律继续任职，不究既往。人民解放军入藏后之一切经费，完全由中央人民政府供给，以减轻西藏人民的负担。
    现在帝国主义正在千方百计地阻扰西藏人民回到祖国的大家庭来，阻止西藏当局的代表团到北京进行合理解决西藏问题的谈判，因为这是不利于帝国主义，而利于祖国和西藏人民的。我们希望西藏当局毅然摆脱帝国主义的控制，直接与前线人民解放军取得联络，共同驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出西藏。西南人民则应以一切努力，支援解放西藏的人民解放军。
  第二、继续肃清土匪特务，巩固革命秩序。
    半年剿匪工作，已获显著成绩。但由于西南土匪的政治性质特别明显，而且有根深蒂固的封建势力作依靠，故仍不可忽视。在土匪仍然活跃的边沿山地，应继续大力进剿，在业已初步净化的地区，应在组织和发动群众、武装人民防匪自卫的基础上，继续肃清潜伏的残匪，防其再起。
    我们在剿匪中，仍应贯彻宽大与镇压相结合，即首恶者必办，胁从者不问，立功者受奖的政策。仍应执行以政治为主、军事为辅的方针。西南各地前一时期曾犯首恶不办的错误，业已纠正。在剿匪期间，批准死刑的权限，仍应属于省主席、行署主任及由省主席、行署主任委托之专署，严禁不经批准不经法庭判决的越权行为。
    特务匪徒在公开活动受到打击之后，必将转变为以隐蔽斗争为主的活动方式。我们在任何时候，都要加强公安部门的工作和人民反对匪特的教育。特别重要的是加强经济保卫工作，严防敌人的破坏。
  第三、实行反恶霸、减租、退押和准备实行土地改革。
    共同纲领第二十七条明确规定：“土地改革为发展生产力和国家工业化的必要条件。凡已实行土地改革的地区，必须保护农民已得土地的所有权。凡尚未实行土地改革的地区，必须发动农民群众，建立农民团体，经过清除土匪恶霸，减租减息和分配土地等项步骤，实现耕者有其田。”西南人民必须为共同纲领此项规定及中央人民政府今年六月三十日颁布的土地改革法之彻底实现而努力。
    西南地区，特别是四川，土地甚为集中。军阀官僚土豪劣绅等封建势力用巧取豪夺方式集中土地的过程，也就是农民破产失业的过程。农民迫切地要求土地，并从地主恶霸的统治之下解放出来。但是由于西南解放较迟，封建势力特别强大，群众尚未普遍发动与组织起来，实行土地改革的条件，尚未准备成熟，故在今冬明春期间，应以清匪、反恶霸、减租为中心。这个步骤不但可以初步解除农民的痛苦，为恢复与发展工农商业创造初步的条件，而且也是为明冬后春开始的土地改革运动打下坚实的基础。
    西南军政委员会已于三月十日公布了减租条例，这个条例仍是适用的。
    减租本身就是一个严重的阶级斗争。如果不打坍封建阶级的恶霸的统治，如果不充分发动农民群众，如果不保障农民的佃权，其结果必然是明减暗不减或先加后减等现象的普遍发生。同时恶霸地主和特务分子必然千方百计地破坏造谣、制造混乱、乃至组织所谓“游击战争”以达到破坏减租之目的。所以清匪反霸为减租运动中不可缺少的组成部分。而由农民代表会议选出之各级农民协会委员会，则是领导反霸减租运动的合法的权力机关。
    反霸、减租运动，同土地改革一样，必须有准备有步骤有秩序地进行，才不致妨碍生产，形成混乱；也才不致为敌人所乘，破坏减租运动。所以，必须在干部中、农民中和地主中，普遍的学习减租条例。无论在准备期间或在实行期间，均须严禁乱打、乱杀、乱捕、乱罚。反霸的目的，在于打坍农村的封建政治统治，保障减租运动的顺利进行，故应采取说道理，依据法律的方法，防止打击面太宽的错误发生。对于愿意依法赔偿群众损失，改悔错误的恶霸分子，应给以自新和生活之路，不必人人皆斗。一切恶霸案件和抵抗减租的地主分子，应交由人民法庭判处，不得由群众大会直接处理。各县人民政府应组织巡回人民法庭，以配合农村的反霸减租运动。
    在反霸和减租斗争中，必须妥善地保护工商业，不得破坏和侵犯。同时减租工作必须与土地改革法的规定相一致，如有违反土地改革法之处，应加纠正和制止。
  第四、恢复和发展经济，继续调整工商业。
    目前西南的经济工作，着眼于争取较快的恢复，同时在恢复的基础上求得某些必需事业的兴建和发展。
    西南工业有相当基础，但须经过改造才能符合于新民主主义建设的需要。现在无论公私企业，都还处在开始克服困难的过渡时间，按照西南的工业特点，只有争取国营企业的开动，才能带动私营企业趋于好转。由于目前国家财政的困难和市场的条件，对于国营企业，暂时还只能作重点的恢复，而置重点于交通事业的恢复和兴建。我们的力量只能集中于办好一两件事，绝不可百事俱举，以免弄得一事无成。成渝铁路的开工，带动了一部分公私企业的恢复，也给我们带来了希望。我们的困难是暂时的，而且正在逐渐地加以克服。我们还要忍受一个时期的困难，但应善于在困难中准备好好转的条件。无论公私企业都须切实改善管理，减低成本。在国营企业中，建立经济核算制度和工厂管理的民主化制度；在私营企业中，建立民主的平等的两利的契约的正确劳资关系，成立劳资协商会议，并克服某些厂商的消极情绪，才利于克服困难并为将来的发展奠定基础。
    调整公私工商业关系，已见初步成效，仍应继续贯彻，使利于生产之发展。指导某些工商业转业和克服无政府生产的工作，也应认真研究和实行。
    在农业方面，务须尽一切努力，保持原有生产水平，不使降低，并在这个基础上，恢复发展，争取在数年内超过战前水平。应该大力保护和提倡棉、麻、糖、桐油、猪鬃、茶叶、烟叶等工业原料及出口物资的生产。对于修建水利、挖掘堰塘、保障灌溉、增加施肥、改良农具种子、防治病虫害、保护林木、植树造林、繁殖牲畜等有关发展农牧林生产的各项事宜，均须贯彻于各级政府和农民协会的经常工作之中，有计划有步骤地领导和组织农民进行。
    对于农村手工业和副业，人民政府应予保护，勿使破坏。其有前途者，还应扶助其作适当之发展。
    现在，我们对于西南经济材料，掌握太少，研究亦极不够，故一时尚难作出全盘的经济建设计划。但应根据现有经济材料，遵照中央建设计划，做到比较有计划地进行各项建设事宜，以节省人力和财力，避免走弯路。
  第五、争取平衡收支，继续稳定物价。
    几月来的物价稳定，得到了人民的支持和拥护，但投机分子仍在伺机而动。最近由于美帝国主义挑起侵略朝鲜的战争，投机分子又在开始蠢动。因此，国营贸易机构必须加强自己的业务，准备足够力量，给投机分子以应有的打击，使业已稳定的物价，长期稳定下去。
    稳定物价的可靠基础，还在于国家财政收支的平衡。在这一方面，我们西南区应该加倍地努力。
    一九四九年度征收公粮的任务相差尚远，必须继续努力。凡已完成百分之七十五以上的县区，即应告一段落，转入清理尾欠阶段。清理的原则是：凡属贫苦农民尚未缴纳者，一律免缴；凡属地主富农欠粮确因超过其负担能力，或其负担数目超过政务院规定者，应予减少；凡属地主富农之负担数目并未超过政务院规定，而仅系暂时困难者，可允其打好欠条，于秋收后补缴；凡属地主富农之负担数目并未超过政务院规定而又有缴纳能力者，应继续追缴；凡属应缴又能缴但采取顽抗行为者，应交由人民法庭予以惩处，禁止乱打乱捕现象之继续发生。
    一九五○年度的秋征公粮，应按中央人民政府规定，以不超过总的应产量百分之十三为原则。各地应从现在开始，作好调查准备工作，避免此次由于情况不熟、办法不善、干部不足所产生的畸轻畸重以及其他错误缺点之重复。
    税收成绩，较之公粮尤差，而在平衡收支解决财政困难上面，税收的完成较之公粮尤属重要。所以今后财政部门应将重点逐渐转到税收工作上面，一方面应根据中央规定，对于过去税收中的不合理部分，作坚决的调整；一方面必须加强税收机构，训练税收干部，简化税收行政，与严重的漏税现象作坚决的斗争。按照中央规定的税率，不准多收，也不准少收，这是我们税收干部必须遵守的原则。
  第六、进行整编复员工作，节减财政开支。
    西南各地的整编工作，已告结束，数万编余人员业已分别作了适当的处理。
    现在人民解放军正进行部分的复员工作，西南区将有大量复员军人，在经过充分动员和教育之后，送回西南各地或全国各地原籍生产，其他各大行政区也将有大批复员军人送回西南原籍生产。这是一件巨大的组织和教育工作，人民解放军确定所有复员军人必须是有家可归而且自愿回籍生产者，并且一律要进行一个月到两个月的专门教育，使能在回乡后自动遵守政府法令，努力生产和努力工作。中央人民政府的人民革命军事委员会和政务院已确定发给复员人员以相当数量的粮食，以帮助复员人员解决一时的生活困难和顺利的转入生产。我各级政府、人民团体和全区人民，必须重视这项工作，在各级复员工作委员会的领导之下，热情地欢迎回乡军人，并帮助他们解决转入生产的困难。
    整编和复员工作，将节减相当数目的财政开支，以便于省出经费投入经济建设方面，并可适当地减轻人民负担。
    人民解放军当前的中心工作是剿匪和进行部分的复员工作。在这两项工作结束之后，人民解放军将遵照毛主席、朱总司令的指示，除以一部分担任国家经济建设之外，均将转入以文化为主的伟大的教育阶段，使在三年内，战士达到高小毕业程度，干部达到初中毕业以上程度。这将大大的提高人民军队的素质和加强国防的力量。
  第七、克服灾荒与救济失业工人。
    入夏以来，各地均已发生零星灾荒，而以贫瘠山地和土匪活跃地区以及素来以副业、手工业为主要生活来源的地区较为严重。各级政府必须重视这个问题，无论灾情大小，均须迅速克服，勿使发展，并保证不饿死一个人。救灾应采取以生产自救为主、组织社会互助和国家补助为辅的方针，不宜采取由国家拨粮单纯救济的方法。应鼓励农村自由借贷，利息由双方自行议定，保证有借有还，以使灾民度过困难。政府则应拨出足够粮食，除以一部施行急赈外，主要用于生产贷款，并领导和组织灾民生产。国营贸易机构尤应大量收购灾民的生产品，以配合救灾的计划。凡属灾情严重地区的政府和人民团体，即应以救灾为工作的中心。灾区的剿匪工作，必须与救灾工作相结合，才能团结群众，肃清匪患。
    救济失业工人的工作，各主要城市均已开始，将有两万人参加铁路修建工程，各地也用各种办法安插了一部分。救济失业工人是我们的政治责任，中央人民政府对此已有妥善规定，我们必须以认真负责的态度加以执行。
