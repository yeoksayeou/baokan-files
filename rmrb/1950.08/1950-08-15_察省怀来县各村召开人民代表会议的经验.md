Experiences in Holding People's Representative Conferences in Villages of Huailai County, Chahar Province
The State Council Political and Legal Affairs Committee sent more than sixty working comrades to work in the countryside of Chahar Province recently. Among them, more than forty comrades were assigned to assist Huailai County in experimenting with village-level government construction. They cooperated with the provincial and special commissioner's office working groups in Huailai for a month and a half. During this period, the villages in Huailai County universally convened village people's representative conferences centered on the topic of summer production, overcoming the formalism that was prevalent in holding people's representative conferences in the past, and solving several pressing problems for the masses in the villages. This article is a summary of the work of the comrades from the Political and Legal Affairs Committee who went to the countryside.

	Previously, Formalism Was a Common Shortcoming

	From the winter of last year to the summer of this year, out of the 280 village-level governments in Huailai County, Chahar Province, 223 villages established people's representative conferences. Due to the inadequate understanding of the people's representative conferences on the part of the county and district leaders, holding people's representative conferences was treated as an isolated task unrelated to general work (for example, the county issued instructions to complete the task within a limited time to avoid hindering production); generally, cadres adopted the attitude of carrying out orders (for example, some district cadres established representative conferences in two villages overnight, and some established representative conferences in four villages in six days). As a result, many village people's representative conferences were merely formalities and did not play their due role. According to the inspection results of Huailai County, only 33 villages were able to genuinely solve some problems for the masses and play the due role of the people's representative conferences. Most of the people's representative conferences in the remaining 190 villages only elected representatives and did not earnestly hold meetings.

	Convening People's Representative Conferences Centered on Discussing Production Solved Many Practical Problems for the Masses

	With the assistance of the provincial government and the special commissioner's office working group, the Huailai County People's Government re-studied the relevant documents and instructions on government construction and summarized past experiences. It was decided that beginning in early June, village people's representative conferences would be universally convened once again, focusing on the central issue of summer production. As of June 25, 198 villages in the county had implemented this decision. Among them, 31 villages newly elected representatives, 157 villages held a meeting with the original representative conferences, and individual re-elections or adjustments were made to the original unsound representative conferences.

	The people's representative conferences in the 198 villages in the county solved a total of 247 problems, mainly including a series of summer production issues such as mutual aid weeding, fertilizing, pest control, production for self-salvation, and flood prevention. Therefore, the masses were further mobilized and organized, and the production enthusiasm of the masses was enhanced. In late June, the first round of weeding of 557,000 mu of field crops in the county was completed, and the second round of weeding was continued, with 11,000 mu of early-maturing crops being weeded three times; and 80% of women were mobilized to participate in weeding work.

	The people's representative conferences in the villages solved the main problems currently existing according to the specific conditions of each village. For example, after discussion and decision by the people's representative conference in Dahuangzhuang, Xinbao'an District, combined with the local troops to build a large dam, protecting 3,000 mu of land and silting 2,000 mu of land. After full deliberation and discussion by the people's representative conference in Canfangying, Huailai District, more than 300 people were employed to repair the dam and dig the drainage channel, which eliminated the threat of water disaster that had not been resolved for several years.

	The people's representative conferences in the villages played a great role in mobilizing women's production. In 33 villages in Huailai District, more than 4,500 women were organized to participate in summer weeding, accounting for about 43% of the total number of women in the district. This year, 120 women in Lao Junzhuang in the district participated in weeding, three times more than last year. Guo Xiulan, director of the Women's Federation in No. 1 Street in the city, led 20 women to work odd jobs weeding, earning two kilograms of rice per person per day, which solved the difficulties of the spring famine.

	The representative conferences in nine disaster-stricken villages solved the problem of production and disaster relief, stopping the development of the disaster. The representative conferences in Xin Zhuang and Miao Gang in Dagu City District decided after discussion to sign a contract with the county supply and marketing cooperative to organize disaster victims to weave 1,600 fruit baskets, earning 5,080 kilograms of rice. Forty grain-deficient households in Dongbali Village, through the discussion and mobilization of the representative conference, organized manpower to dismantle and wash 2,000 coats for the troops, earning 9,000 kilograms of millet. In Mahuangyu, a severely affected village in the Mulberry Garden District, more than half of the 80 households in the village were disaster victims. After repeated discussions by the people's representative conference, the village chief and the village party branch secretary and others divided the work and led 47 disaster victims to Wanping to work odd jobs, and the 58 male and female laborers remaining in the village also organized mutual assistance to do weeding work in place of those who went out. Those who went out earned 2,700 kilograms of millet within half a month. The masses reflected that: "This is a good way to do it, the disaster can be overcome, and the seedlings will not be abandoned."

	In Daziying Village, West Garden District, there was a widespread unreasonable and unfair phenomenon in agricultural tax, where the assessment of production was generally too low and the village cadres were even lower. This phenomenon was corrected after the evaluation by this representative conference, and the representatives expressed their satisfaction.

	The representative conferences of the seven streets in Huailai City unanimously discussed the use of medicine to kill yam pests (this method had not been used in the past), borrowed 13 sprayers from the county supply and marketing cooperative, and extinguished the pests on 1,300 mu of yam seedlings in ten days.

	Many villages re-evaluated substitute farming at the representative conference. At the representative conference in Liangtiantun, Shacheng District, the unreasonable phenomenon that the substitute farming work of the village cadres' military dependents was more than that of the general military dependents was corrected. Other representative conferences solved various problems such as borrowing water carts, borrowing fertilizers, and reclaiming wasteland.

	All of the above proves that this time the people's representative conferences in the villages have taken a step forward in promoting summer production, and many people reflected: "This time the representative conference is really useful!"

	On the other hand, criticism and self-criticism were generally carried out at the representative conference, exposing the bad work style and illegal and undisciplined behavior of some village cadres. For example, the village chief and other main cadres of Liangtiantun Village, Shacheng District, burned incense and made offerings at the temple fair, and ate and drank lavishly. They were sharply criticized by the representatives at this representative conference, and they also seriously conducted self-criticism. Because the representative conferences in the villages conducted a serious inspection of the work style of the village cadres with criticism and encouragement, the cadres received a good democratic education. Therefore, on the one hand, the relationship between the cadres and the masses was improved through this representative conference, and many activists and new cadres emerged; on the other hand, 85 cadres with very bad influence were replaced in 51 villages, and the corrupt and perverted behavior of Song Hongzhu, the village chief of Songjiaying Village, Shacheng District, and others was reported and sent to the county government for handling. In addition, 71 relatively backward village governments in the county were transformed in the village people's representative conferences.

	Several Experiences in Holding Village People's Representative Conferences Well

	Experience proves that the village people's representative conference is the best way for the village government to contact the masses, implement policies, and unite the people of all circles to work together. Checking work through the representative conference is also one of the most effective ways to overcome bad work styles such as bureaucracy and commandism.

	Experience proves that the key to holding a good meeting is, first of all, to honestly solve one or two of the most pressing problems for the masses, and never pursue formalism. In terms of elections, we should strive for simplicity and ease of implementation. Whether it is a newly established representative conference or a re-election of representatives, the representatives should generally be selected by the masses after deliberation and recommendation in areas divided according to natural streets. It is not necessary to use any bean-throwing or similar voting methods. All procedures such as citizen registration, publication of the citizen list, and division of citizen groups should be as simple as possible. Only the small number of people without civil rights should be reviewed, announced, and explained. As for the problems to be solved, the cadres should first investigate and study, integrate the opinions of relevant, relatively common, and urgently needed but solvable matters, and initially formulate solutions to the problems, and then let the representatives fully deliberate and negotiate with the masses in various regions before holding a meeting. Only a meeting with such full preparation can solve practical problems.

	To implement the above ideas, it is necessary to constantly educate cadres with examples. Before the universal convening of the people's representative conferences in the villages in Huailai County this time, although some criticisms were made of the ideas of old democracy and the formalism of past meetings, a small number of cadres still excessively pursued formalism, adopted a complicated set of election procedures and meeting procedures, but did not concentrate their efforts on solving major problems. Some representative conferences had complex content and no center, discussing more than 30 issues in one night, and as a result, none of the issues could be thoroughly resolved.

	In addition, to universally hold village people's representative conferences well within the scope of a county, according to our experience, the following conditions and steps are required: First, the county's people's representative conference of all circles should be held well as a demonstration for the whole county, because the focus of local government construction is in the county. When the county people's representative conference is held, it is best for one person from each village to participate or attend as an observer. Second, each district should conduct key experiments in several villages to create experience and influence nearby villages. Third, cadres should be universally and repeatedly educated with practical examples and experiences related to holding good representative conferences.

　　察省怀来县各村召开人民代表会议的经验
　　政务院政法委员会参事室
    中央人民政府政务院政法委员会最近组织了六十多个工作同志到察哈尔乡下工作，其中四十多个同志担任了帮助怀来县实验村级政权建设的工作。他们配合着省和专署的工作组在怀来工作了一个半月。怀来县各村在这个时期内普遍召开了以夏季生产为中心议题的村人民代表会议，克服了过去在召开人民代表会议方面普遍存在着的形式主义的缺点，为各村群众解决了若干迫切的问题。这篇文章是政法委员会下乡工作同志回来以后的工作总结。
                ——编者
    以前普遍存在着形式主义的缺点
    察哈尔省怀来县自去年冬季开始至本年夏季以前，全县二百八十个村级政权中，有二百二十三个村建立了人民代表会。由于县区领导方面对于人民代表会议的认识不足，把召开人民代表会议当做与一般工作无联系的孤立的任务来突击（如县里曾发布过为了不妨碍生产限期完成的指示）；一般干部对举行人民代表会议也都采取了奉命从事的态度（如有的区干部一夜建立了两个村的代表会，有的六天建立了四个村的代表会），因而很多村的人民代表会议只是徒具形式而没有发挥应有的作用。据怀来县的检查结果，各村人民代表会议能真正给群众解决一些问题，起了人民代表会议应有的作用的，仅三十三个村。其余一百九十个村的人民代表会议大都只是选出了代表，而没有认真地开好会议。
    召开了以讨论生产为中心的人民代表会议，为群众解决了很多实际问题
    怀来县人民政府在省府专署工作组和我们的帮助下，重新学习了有关建政的文件和指示，并总结了过去的经验。决定从六月初开始，围绕着夏季生产这一中心问题，再一次普遍地召开了各村人民代表会议。截至六月二十五日止，全县二百八十个村，有一百九十八个村执行了这一决定。其中有三十一个村新选了代表，有一百五十七个村就原有代表会开了一次会议，旧有代表会不健全的，进行了个别补选或调整。
    全县一百九十八个村的人民代表会议，共解决了大小问题二百四十七件，其中主要是互助锄苗、施肥、杀虫、生产自救、防洪等一系列的夏季生产问题。因此，进一步发动与组织了群众，并提高了群众的生产积极性。在六月下旬，全县五十五万七千亩大田作物已锄完头遍，继续展开了二锄，有一万一千亩早熟作物锄完三遍；并发动了百分之八十的妇女参加了锄苗工作。
    各村人民代表会议，根据各村的具体情况解决了当前存在着的主要问题。例如新保安区大黄庄经人民代表会议讨论并决定，结合当地驻军筑大坝一道，护地三千亩，淤地二千亩。怀来区蚕房营，经过人民代表会议充分酝酿讨论后，用人工三百多个，从事修坝及挖泄水道，解除了几年来未解决的水患威胁。
    各村人民代表会议对于发动妇女生产起了很大的作用。怀来区三十三个村，组织了四千五百多个妇女参加夏锄，约占全区妇女总数的百分之四十三。该区老君庄今年参加锄苗的妇女有一百二十人，比去年多三倍。城内一街妇联主任郭秀兰曾带领二十个妇女出去打短工拔草，每人每天挣米二斤，解决了春荒困难。
    有九个灾荒村的代表会议，解决了生产救灾问题，使灾荒停止发展。大古城区的辛庄、庙港两村代表会议讨论决定和县供销社订合同，组织灾民编果筐一千六百付，得米五千零八十斤。东八里村四十户缺粮户，通过代表会议的讨论与发动，组织了人力给部队拆洗大衣二千件，挣得小米九千斤。桑园区重灾村麻黄峪，全村八十户，有一半以上是灾民，经过人民代表会议反复讨论之后，就由村长和村支部书记等分工带领四十七个灾民到宛平去打短工，留在村里的五十八个男女劳动力也组织互助，代替外出的人做锄苗工作。出去的人，半个月内就挣回小米二千七百斤。群众反映说：这样办很好，灾荒能度过去，苗也荒不了。
    西花园区达子营村，在农业税方面普遍地存在着评产过低而村干部更低的不合理不公平现象，经过这次代表会议的评议，这种现象被纠正了，代表们都表示满意。
    怀来城七个街的代表会议一致讨论了用药剂杀灭山药虫害（过去是没有用过这种办法的），向县供销社贷到喷雾器十三架，十天时间扑灭了一千三百亩山药秧上的虫害。
    不少村庄在代表会议上重新评定了代耕。沙城区良田屯在代表会议上纠正了村干军属的代耕工多于一般军属的代耕工的不合理现象。其他还有些代表会议解决了贷水车、贷肥料、开荒等各种问题。
    以上这些，都证明了这次各村的人民代表会议是把夏季生产推进了一步，很多群众反映：“这回代表会真顶事！”
    另一方面，在代表会议上一般地开展了批评与自我批评，揭发了部分村干部的恶劣作风和违法乱纪行为，例如沙城区良田屯村长等几个主要干部，在庙会上烧香上供，并大吃大喝，在这次代表会上受到了代表们尖锐的批评，他们也都认真地进行了自我检讨。由于各村代表会议对村干部的作风进行了有批评也有鼓励的认真检查，使干部们受了一次很好的民主教育。因此，一方面经过这次代表会议改善了干部与群众的关系，涌现了许多积极分子和新干部；另一方面在五十一个村中撤换了八十五个影响很坏的干部，检举了沙城区宋家营村长宋洪珠等五人的贪污枉法行为，送县府法办。此外，全县有七十一个较落后的村政权，都在村人民代表会议中获得了改造。
    开好村人民代表会议的几点经验
    经验证明，乡村人民代表会议乃是乡村政权机关联系群众、贯彻政策、团结各界人民协同工作的最好方式。经过代表会检查工作，也是克服官僚主义和命令主义等不良作风的最有效办法之一。
    经验证明：开好会议的关键，首先是要老老实实的为群众解决当前一二个最迫切的问题，千万不要专追求形式。以选举来说，应力求简单易行。不论新建立的代表会或补选代表，其代表的产生，一般应按自然街道划分区域，经过群众酝酿推选出来即可。不必一定要用什么投豆或类同票选的方法。所有公民登记、公布公民榜、划分公民小组等手续，更应力求简单。仅将那少数没有公民权的人，经过审查后公布说明一下即可。至于要解决的问题，应由干部先调查研究，综合有关较有普遍性的急待解决而能解决的一两件事的意见，并且要初步拟定解决问题的办法，然后让代表们在各区域的群众中经过充分酝酿与协商，再来开会。只有这样有充分准备的会议，才能解决实际问题。
    要贯彻以上的思想，须以实例对干部进行不断的教育。怀来县在这次普遍召开各村人民代表会议之前，虽曾对旧民主主义的思想和过去开会的形式主义问题作了某些批判，但仍有少数干部过分地追求形式，采取了一套复杂的选举手续和会议程序，反而没有把力量集中在解决主要问题方面。有的代表会议内容复杂，没有中心，一晚上讨论三十多个问题，结果自然是一个问题也无法得到彻底解决。
    此外，在一个县的范围内要普遍开好村的人民代表会议，据我们体会，须有以下的条件和步骤：第一、先应开好县的各界人民代表会议做为全县示范，因为地方建政问题的重点是在县。县人民代表会议召开时，最好各村均有一人参加或列席。第二、各区要做几个村的重点试验，创造经验，影响附近各村。第三、要以有关开好代表会议的实际事例与经验为题材，对干部进行普遍的反复的教育。
