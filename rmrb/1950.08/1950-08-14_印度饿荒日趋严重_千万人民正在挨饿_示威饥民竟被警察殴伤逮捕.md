　　Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 12th: The famine situation in India is worsening, and millions of people are starving. The Madras Province government has twice reduced residents' food rations in the past forty days, from the original 12 ounces of grain per person per day to the current 6 ounces.

　　In many areas, residents are not receiving any food rations at all. Former Madras Province Governor Prakasam, describing the famine situation in Madras Province, said: "The situation is deteriorating. I have just come from the Salem district, where almost all the residents are starving... There is also starvation in Malabar. The ration has been reduced to 4 ounces of grain per person, and even this ration, no one is sure they can receive it tomorrow." Prakasam pointed out that due to the famine, suicide has become commonplace, even among government employees.

　　The situation is particularly severe in the Saharsa, Purnia, Monghyr, and Bhagalpur districts of Bihar Province. On August 9th, a demonstration was held in Begusarai town, where starving farmers from neighboring villages said: "Give us bread, or kill us."

　　In the Murshidabad district of West Bengal Province, rice prices have tripled in the past few months. Due to excessive price increases, working people in West Bengal Province can no longer afford rice.

　　On August 8th, a demonstration was held in Berhampore, West Bengal Province, attended by five thousand starving citizens and farmers who came from the countryside with their children. The demonstrators demanded that the government provide them with bread. The police beat the demonstrators with batons and used tear gas, and many people were injured. The police arrested thirty demonstrators, including women.

　　印度饿荒日趋严重  千万人民正在挨饿
    示威饥民竟被警察殴伤逮捕
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社德里讯：印度粮荒情况日趋严重，千万人民正在挨饿。马德拉斯省政府在最近四十天内已两度削减居民的粮食配给，原来每人每日配给十二盎斯的谷类，现在已减至六盎斯。
    在许多地区，居民根本得不到粮食配给。前马德拉斯省长普罗卡森描述马德拉斯省的饥荒情况时说：“情况日趋恶化。我刚从撒冷区来，那里几乎全部居民都在挨饿……在马拉巴尔也有饥饿状态。配给量已减到每人四盎斯的谷类，即使这个配给量也没有人有把握在明天可以领到。”普罗卡森指出，由于饥荒，甚至在政府职员间，自杀也习以为常了。
    在比哈尔省的沙哈尔斯、普尔尼亚、孟吉尔和巴加德普尔诸区，情况特别严重。比古沙尔镇于八月九日举行示威，从邻近村庄上来的饥饿的农民说：“给我们面包，或者杀死我们。”
    在西孟加拉省的茂尔希达巴德区，在过去几月中米价涨了三倍。由于物价过度上涨，西孟加拉省的劳动人民多买不起米谷。
    八月八日，西孟加拉省贝尔加姆普尔举行了示威，有五千名饥饿的市民和携带着孩子从乡下来的农民参加。示威者要求政府供给他们面包。警察用棍棒殴打示威者，并且使用催泪弹，许多人受伤。警察拘捕了三十名示威者，其中还有妇女。
