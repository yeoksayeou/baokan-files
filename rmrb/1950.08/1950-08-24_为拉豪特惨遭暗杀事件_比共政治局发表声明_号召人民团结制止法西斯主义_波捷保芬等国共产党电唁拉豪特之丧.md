Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, August 22nd, TASS: The Politburo of the Belgian Communist Party issued a statement regarding the brutal assassination of Lahaut, stating: The instigators of the murderers are in the ranks of the new royalist elements of the Christian Social Party, whose newspapers and propaganda organs have been clamoring for terror and assassination for months. The executioners are members of the royalist and Flemish National Union (this was a former fascist party), and they have raised their heads and resorted to terror because they know they will be protected by the ruling party and the government, which relies on them for an absolute majority.

The Politburo emphasized: The assassination of our beloved Lahaut is a warning to the working people and democrats who are fighting for peace. The Politburo believes that the "national unity" policy, which serves the interests of the reactionaries, must be opposed with an alliance of the working class and all forces for peace, freedom, and social progress, united more closely and powerfully. Only these forces can successfully stop fascism, meet the demands of the working people, and safeguard the peace that feels the growing crisis.

Xinhua News Agency, August 23rd, Comprehensive TASS Dispatch: The Communist Parties and Workers' Parties of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Finland, and Sweden have sent telegrams of condolence for the death of Belgian Communist Party Chairman Lahaut, expressing their protest and anger at Lahaut's assassination. Polish United Workers' Party Chairman Bierut stated in a telegram of condolence to Belgian Communist Party General Secretary Lalmand: "We are extremely shocked to learn of the heinous crime committed by the fascists who murdered Comrade Lahaut. We express our anger and grief along with the Belgian working class, the fraternal Belgian Communist Party, and its Central Committee. The Polish working class will always remember Comrade Lahaut."

The Presidium of the Czechoslovak Communist Party stated in a telegram of condolence to the Belgian Communist Party Central Committee: The assassination of Lahaut has once again demonstrated the despicable means adopted by the reactionaries in their struggle against the powerful movement for peace and progress. This crime must mobilize all those who aspire to justice to jointly denounce the imperialist murderers and criminals.

Bulgarian Communist Party Secretary Chervenkov expressed in a telegram of condolence to the Belgian Communist Party Central Committee, firm support for the struggle of the Belgian working class under the leadership of the Communist Party.

The acting chairman of the Swedish Communist Party, Hagberg, stated in his telegram of condolence to the Belgian Communist Party Central Committee: This political assassination shows that the warmongers will stop at nothing to oppose the standard-bearers of peace and socialism. All peace and progress fighters should further intensify the struggle against the warmongers.

The Finnish Communist Party expressed in its telegram of condolence its deep conviction that the Belgian Communist Party will intensify the struggle for the liberation of the working people in response to this crime by the reactionaries.

    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社布鲁塞尔二十二日讯：比利时共产党政治局为拉豪特惨遭凶恶的暗杀事件发表声明称：凶手的教唆者们就在基督教社会党的新保皇党分子的队伍中，他们的报纸和宣传机关好几个月来就扬言要实行恐怖和暗杀了。刽子手们是保皇党的和法兰德斯民族主义者联盟（按这是过去的法西斯政党）的分子，他们已抬起头来，诉诸恐怖手段了，因为他们知道：他们一定会受到统治的政党和政府的庇护的，政府是靠着他们才取得绝对的多数。
    政治局强调指出：我们亲爱的拉豪特被暗杀，是对于为和平而奋斗的劳动人民和民主人士的一种警告。政治局认为：必须用工人阶级与和平、自由及社会进步的一切力量最亲密地结合起来的联盟，更坚强有力地来反对符合反动派的利益的“举国一致”政策。唯有这些力量才能够成功地制止法西斯主义，满足劳动人民的要求，而守护住感受到日益增长的危机的和平。
    【新华社二十三日讯】综合塔斯社讯：波、捷、保、芬、瑞（典）各国共产党与工人党分别电唁比利时共产党主席拉豪特之丧，对拉豪特之遭受暗杀，同表抗议与愤怒。波兰统一工人党主席贝鲁特在致比共总书记拉尔曼的唁电中称：“我们闻悉杀害拉豪特同志的法西斯分子所造成的恶毒罪行，至为震惊。我们和比利时的工人阶级，兄弟般的比利时共产党及其中央委员会一同表示愤怒与哀悼。波兰工人阶级将永远记住拉豪特同志。”
    捷共中央主席团在致比共中央的唁电中称：暗杀拉豪特一事，已经再度表现出反动派在它对拥护和平和进步的强大运动斗争时所采取的卑鄙手段。这一罪行必然使一切渴望正义的人们动员起来，共同声讨帝国主义杀人犯和犯罪者。
    保共中央书记契尔文科夫在致比共中央的唁电中，表示坚决声援比利时工人阶级在共产党领导下进行的斗争。
    瑞（典）共代理主席哈格堡在其致比共中央的唁电中称：这种政治性的暗杀显示，战争贩子们已不择手段地反对和平与社会主义的旗手。所有的和平与进步战士都应该进一步为反对战争贩子而加紧斗争。
    芬共在其唁电中表示深信比利时共产党必将加紧争取劳动人民解放的斗争，以答复反动派的这一罪行。
