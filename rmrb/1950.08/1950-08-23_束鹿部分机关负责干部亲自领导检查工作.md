　　Leading Cadres of Certain Organs in Shulu County Personally Lead Inspection Work
    [Our Dispatch] In Hebei's Shulu County, some organs have adopted the method of having responsible cadres personally lead the inspection work, thus swiftly launching the rectification campaign. The People's Court of Shulu County originally had a large backlog of cases, which caused great dissatisfaction among the masses. However, when the People's Court conducted its inspection, it did not start with these problems, but instead inspected some trivial lifestyle issues. Furthermore, they mistakenly believed ideologically that the reason for the backlog of cases was mainly due to insufficient assistance from the county government leadership. County Head Zhang Ping, upon learning of this situation, personally assisted the cadres of the People's Court in inspecting their work, and stated that everyone could raise opinions and criticisms of the county government leadership during the inspection process. After in-depth inspection, everyone understood that the main problem was their own lack of responsibility to the people. The county government leadership had pointed out: "Through general specific cases, expand the publicity of the handling results and publicize policies to reduce the number of cases." However, the People's Court did not follow this and continued to use the old methods to handle cases. As a result, the number of cases accumulated more and more. At the same time, there was a lack of education for criminals, so that some criminals committed repeated offenses after being released and were sent back to the court. After Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, Comrade Zhang Junshi, learned that the Organization Department's inspection was not progressing, he personally guided the inspection of the implementation of the reward and punishment system, and inspected the specific facts of the delayed handling of more than twenty cadres who violated Party discipline. From this, he discovered the main problems in the work of the Organization Department. However, the responsible comrades of some departments abandoned their leadership over the rectification and even did not participate in the study themselves. Some comrades in the Public Security Bureau therefore suspected that this was a case of rectifying subordinates but not superiors. Based on this experience, the Shulu County Party Committee instructed the responsible comrades of all departments to earnestly lead the rectification study, and to first inspect the leadership work, and then inspect the general work.

　　束鹿部分机关负责干部亲自领导检查工作
    【本报讯】河北束鹿县有些机关，采用负责干部亲自领导检查工作的办法，整风运动因此迅速展开。束鹿县人民法院原来积案很多，群众对此非常不满。但是人民法院在检查工作时，却不从这些问题着手，而去检查一些生活细节问题。并且在思想上还错误地认为：所以积压这些案件，主要是因为县政府领导上帮助不够。张萍县长根据这一情况，便亲自帮助人民法院干部来检查工作，并表示在检查工作中，大家可以对县政府领导上提出意见和批评。经过深入检查后，大家了解了主要是自己缺乏对人民负责的态度。县政府领导上曾指出过：“通过一般性的具体案件，扩大宣传处理结果，宣传政策，以减少案情”；但是人民法院并未按此进行，仍是采用过去的办法来处理案件。因此案件越积越多。同时对犯人也缺少教育，以致有些犯人释放后重犯，又送法院处理。县委副书记张君实同志在了解组织部检查不下去的情况后，便亲自指导检查执行奖惩制度情形，和检查对二十多个违反党纪的干部的拖延处理的具体事实。由此发现了组织部工作中的主要问题。但是有些部门的负责同志却放弃了对整风的领导，甚至自己不参加学习。公安局有些同志因此怀疑这是整下不整上。束鹿县委根据这个经验，指示各部门负责同志，必须切实领导整风学习，并首先检查领导工作，然后检查一般工作。
