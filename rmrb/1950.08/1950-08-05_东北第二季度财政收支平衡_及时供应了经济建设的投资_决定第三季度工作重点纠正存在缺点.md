Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 3rd: The Northeast region's fiscal work in the second quarter has achieved non-reduced revenue and tightened expenditure during the off-season, thereby timely supplying investment for economic construction and ensuring fiscal balance. In terms of revenue, industrial and commercial taxes and commodity taxes have both fulfilled their targets. Industrial profit remittance has completed 42.8 percent of the annual target. Customs duties have completed 62.9 percent of the semi-annual planned target. Domestic trade profits have completed the quarterly target. Foreign trade profits, due to imported materials not reaching the original planned target, have completed a total of 38 percent of the annual target in the first and second quarters combined. Industrial investment, by the end of the second quarter, has paid out 47 percent of the total annual investment amount.

The Northeast People's Government's Finance Department, during its recent inspection of tax collection work in the second quarter, discovered many shortcomings. For example, there were phenomena of excessively light or heavy burdens of agricultural tax in various parts of the Northeast, mainly due to inconsistent assessments of land yield grades across different regions. In terms of urban taxation, there were also phenomena of small cities bearing heavier burdens than large cities, and imbalances in burdens across different industries and regions. In addition, some state-owned enterprises have not yet fully implemented economic accounting systems. For example, factories and production units under the Northeast Finance Department's Salt Affairs Bureau, Monopoly Bureau, Clothing Bureau, and Grain Bureau have failed to accurately calculate and reduce costs, resulting in difficulties in calculating profits to be remitted.

In light of the current specific situation of the Finance Department's work, the Northeast People's Government has decided that the focus of work for the third quarter will be: (1) To adjust urban taxation, simplify procedures, and rectify the work style of tax personnel. (2) To adjust land grades, prepare for autumn grain collection work, and unify standards and methods for assessing land grades and normal yields. (3) To improve the financial management system of state-owned enterprises, and systematically conduct in-depth inspections and urge enterprises to implement economic accounting systems. (4) To complete the preparation of the 1951 fiscal plan.

　　东北第二季度财政收支平衡
    及时供应了经济建设的投资
    决定第三季度工作重点纠正存在缺点
    【新华社沈阳三日电】东北区第二季度财政工作，已经做到淡季收入不减少及开支紧缩，因而及时供应了经济建设的投资，并保证了财政收支平衡。在收入方面，工商税和货物税都已完成任务。工业利润提缴完成全年任务的百分之四十二点八。关税完成半年计划任务的百分之六十二点九，内地贸易利润已完成本季度任务，对外贸易利润因进口物资没有达到原订计划，因此一、二季度合计完成全年任务百分之三十八。工业投资到第二季度末为止，已支付了全年总投资额的百分之四十七。
    东北人民政府财政部在最近检查第二季度税收的工作时发现不少缺点。例如，东北各地在农业税负担上曾有畸轻畸重的现象，这主要是由于各地对地级产量的评定不划一所引起的。在城市税收工作方面，也有小城市负担重于大城市，行业与行业、地区与地区负担不平衡的现象。此外，有些国营企业也还没有完全贯彻经济核算制。例如东北财政部所属盐务、专卖、被服、粮食等局的工厂及生产单位，都未能精密计算和减低成本，因而在计算应上缴的利润时发生困难。
    东北人民政府针对目前财政部工作具体情况，已决定第三季度的工作重点为：（一）调整城市税收，简化手续，整顿税务工作人员的作风。（二）调整土地等级，准备秋收征粮工作，统一评定土地等级及常年产量的标准和办法。（三）健全国营企业的财务管理制度，有系统地深入检查、督促各企业实行经济核算制。（四）完成一九五一年财政计划编制工作。
