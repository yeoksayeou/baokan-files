Xinhua News Agency, August 1st:

Speech by Zhang Lan, Chairman of the China Democratic League, at the Beijing celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day and demonstration against the US invasion of Taiwan and Korea:

　　Chairman, fellow compatriots:

　　Today is the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It was thanks to the People's Liberation Army that China won the victory in the Anti-Japanese War. It was thanks to the People's Liberation Army that China won the victory in the people's revolutionary war against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. It is thanks to the People's Liberation Army that the Chinese people have this great People's Republic of China today. These glorious deeds have written the glorious history of the People's Liberation Army over the past 23 years.

　　On this glorious August 1st anniversary, I would like to extend my highest respect and warm congratulations on behalf of the China Democratic League to Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army.

　　Today, the Chinese people can boldly declare to the world that we in China have a real people's revolutionary force. This strong and great people's revolutionary force is truly composed of the Chinese people, belongs entirely to all the Chinese people, and will always serve the Chinese people. This people's revolutionary force has been tested and tempered by fire and blood in the 23 years of struggle. This team, which grew up from the people, this people's revolutionary team, which grew from 30,000 to 5 million, has established a new China of people's democracy, and it definitely has the power to protect this new China of people's democracy. This strong and great people's revolutionary force will always be the defender of the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation, and it is also an important force for defending peace in the Far East and defending world peace.

　　After 23 years of war, the People's Liberation Army finally achieved an unprecedented victory and established peace in China. We Chinese people love peace and are willing to build our new country in peace, but if the warmongers dare to infringe upon our peace, we Chinese people will resolutely stand with the People's Liberation Army and fight to defend China's peace.

　　On this August 1st Festival, I especially want to awaken the attention of American imperialism. Since 1945, the US government has wholeheartedly supported the reactionary forces in China, undermined the Chinese revolution, and hindered China's progress. For five years, the US government has supplied more than six billion US dollars to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, as well as a large number of airplanes, bombs, tanks, guns, countless military advisors and spies. They helped Chiang Kai-shek to fight against the Chinese People's Liberation Army and to slaughter the Chinese people. Now Chiang Kai-shek has been defeated by the power of the Chinese people, and the US government's plot to colonize China has completely failed. But US President Truman does not know how to repent today, but instead his ambitions have exploded. On June 27th, he issued a statement, mobilizing the Seventh Fleet, and using American force to directly obstruct us from liberating Taiwan. Using American force to directly interfere in our China's internal affairs. Truman tore up the Atlantic Charter, the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, and the UN Charter. And he also went back on his own statement on January 5th this year about recognizing Taiwan as Chinese territory. Truman's act of aggression, which violates the law and violates faith, is deliberately provoking the Chinese people, so today I want to seriously warn US President Truman that he should bear all the responsibilities for this act of aggression. The Chinese people are not intimidated and are not afraid of power. Today, China's strong and great people's armed forces definitely have the confidence and strength to defend the motherland.

　　Our strong and great people's revolutionary armed forces have been tempered in the flames of cruel war. They have consistently fought to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. They have consistently fought to defend the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation. They are always ready to severely strike at adventurous aggressors in order to defend our motherland and to safeguard world peace.

　　This is my sincere congratulatory message to the Chinese People's Liberation Army today, and this is my serious warning to US imperialism today!

　　中国民主同盟主席
    张澜的演词
    【新华社一日讯】中国民主同盟主席张澜在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的演词：主席、各位同胞：
    今天是中国人民解放军建军的二十三周年纪念日。有了人民解放军，中国才有抗日战争的胜利。有了人民解放军，中国才有“反帝、反封建、反官僚资本”这种人民革命战争的胜利。有了人民解放军，中国人民今天才有这个伟大的中华人民共和国。这些光荣的事迹，写成了人民解放军二十三年来光荣的历史。
    在这样一个光荣的八一纪念日，我谨代表中国民主同盟向中国人民革命军事委员会毛主席，向中国人民解放军朱总司令，向人民解放军全体指挥员和战斗员，致崇高的敬意，和热烈的庆贺。
    今天中国人民可以大胆的向全世界宣布，我们中国有了真实的人民革命武力了，这个坚强伟大的人民革命武力，是真正由中国人民组成的，是完全属于中国全体人民的，是永远为中国人民服务的，这个人民革命武力，在二十三年的斗争历史中，是经过了火与血的考验和锻炼的，这个从人民中间成长起来的队伍，这支从三万人发展到了五百万人的人民革命队伍，他建立了人民民主的新中国，他绝对有力量保护这个人民民主的新中国，这个坚强伟大的人民革命武力，永远是中华民族独立自由的保卫者，也即是保卫远东和平，和保卫世界和平的一支重要力量。
    人民解放军经过了二十三年的战争，终于获得了空前的胜利，建立了中国的和平，我们中国人民爱好和平，愿意在和平中建设我们的新国家，但如果战争贩子们，敢于侵犯我们的和平，我们中国人民坚决与人民解放军站在一起，为保卫中国和平而战斗。
    在今天这个八一节，我特别要唤醒美帝国主义注意，从一九四五年起，美国政府是全心全力支持着中国的反动力量，破坏中国的革命，阻碍中国的进步，五年以来，美国政府，曾经供给了蒋匪帮六十亿以上的美元，大量的飞机、炸弹、坦克、枪炮、无数的军事参谋和间谍，他们帮助蒋匪来与中国人民解放军为敌，来屠杀中国的老百姓，如今蒋匪已经被中国人民的力量打垮了，美国政府使中国殖民地化的阴谋，是彻底失败了。但是美国总统杜鲁门今天不知改悔，反而野心勃发，竟于六月二十七日发表声明，调动第七舰队，用美国的武力，直接来阻扰我们解放台湾。用美国的武力，直接来干涉我们中国的内政。杜鲁门撕毁了大西洋宪章、开罗宣言、波茨坦宣言和联合国的宪章。他并且翻悔了他自己在今年一月五日关于承认台湾为中国领土的声明，杜鲁门这种破坏法律，违背信义的侵略行为，是存心向我中国人民挑衅，所以今天我要严重的警告美国总统杜鲁门，他应担负这种侵略行为的一切责任，中国人民是不受威吓，不怕强权的，今天中国坚强伟大的人民武装队伍，绝对有了保卫祖国的信心与力量。
    我们坚强伟大的人民革命武力，是从残酷的战争烈火中锻炼出来的。他们一贯为着保卫中国主权与领土的完整而战斗。他们一贯为着保卫中华民族的独立自由而战斗。他们随时准备着痛击冒险侵略者，以保卫我们的祖国，以保障世界的和平。
    这是我今天贡献给中国人民解放军的诚恳祝词，这就是我今天给予美帝国主义的严重警告！
