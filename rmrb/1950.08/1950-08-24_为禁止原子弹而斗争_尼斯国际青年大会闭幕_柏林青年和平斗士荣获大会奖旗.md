    The main theme of the conference was the struggle to ban atomic bombs. Representatives spoke of their activities in collecting signatures for the Stockholm Appeal.

    尼斯国际青年大会闭幕
    柏林青年和平斗士荣获大会奖旗
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十日讯：尼斯国际青年大会已于二十日闭幕。真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫撰文评论大会的成就称：大会雄辩地说明了青年和平斗士们的阵线正在扩大和加强。虽然这些代表们在途中遭遇了许多阻碍，可是，仍有一万名代表从法国和意大利各地到达尼斯。
    为禁止原子弹而斗争，是这次大会的主调。代表们都述说了他们为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集签名时的活动。大会一致决定将有着世界民主青年联盟盟徽的奖旗，授予征得签名最多的柏林青年和平斗士。
    这次大会扼要地厘定了许多重大措施，以扩展和促进广泛而全面的反对战争贩子的斗争。
    大会得到了远在尼斯之外青年的热烈的回响。大会与会者收到了全球各地千百封的贺电。
    二十日，尼斯的居民在淹水的大街上欢送年青的和平斗士，那时他们正排成浩浩荡荡的队伍，作最后一次的示威游行。大会一万名与会者紧紧地牵着手，形成一条连绵无尽的锁链——在斗争中团结一致的象征。
