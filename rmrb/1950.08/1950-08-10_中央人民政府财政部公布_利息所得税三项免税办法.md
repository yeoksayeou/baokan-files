　　Central People's Government Ministry of Finance Announces
　　Three Tax Exemption Measures for Interest Income
　　[Xinhua News Agency, 8th] The Central People's Government Ministry of Finance has recently announced three tax exemption provisions for interest income tax. According to the measures for the collection of interest income tax, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administrative Council has issued a notice that it will be implemented throughout the country from July 1st of this year; however, the notice did not explicitly stipulate the tax exemption issues for certain interest income. Now, the Ministry, upon instruction from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Administrative Council, has formulated three tax exemption regulations for the convenience of local implementation before the official regulations on interest income tax are promulgated, and notified the financial and economic committees, tax bureaus of major administrative regions, and the people's governments and tax bureaus of centrally administered provinces (cities) to implement them from July. The three tax exemption regulations are as follows: (1) The interest income from time deposits of the business funds of education, culture, public welfare, and relief organizations or groups, all of which are used for their own undertakings, is exempt from tax. However, the depositor must submit supporting documents to the tax authorities for approval in advance, and hand them over to the payer for safekeeping and inspection. (2) Interest income from loans by silver and money businesses, and from transactions between their headquarters and branches or between businesses in the same industry, is exempt from tax. (3) Dividend income from investments in enterprises is exempt from tax.
