Northeast Regions and Industries Universally Promote the Advanced Experience of the Ma Hengchang Group
    257 Model Groups Have Emerged, Solving Several Ideological Problems in the Promotion
    [Our Newspaper News] Special Correspondent Li Chi reports: Since the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions called for the promotion of the Ma Hengchang Group's experience in April this year, various provinces, cities, and industries in the Northeast have gradually begun to implement it and have achieved initial results. By mid-July, according to incomplete statistics, 257 model groups had emerged. By learning from the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, these groups have become good examples in production for ensuring the completion and exceeding of tasks, improving quality, saving raw materials, taking care of machines, implementing the responsibility system, and strengthening worker solidarity. For example, the bed group of the fourth department of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory, after learning from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, completed the entire month's task twelve days ahead of schedule in April, improved quality by five to ten times, and established four kinds of charts (group division of labor personal plan progress chart, production division of labor task chart, quality performance comparison chart, responsible performance inspection chart), which played a promoting role in all workshops of the factory.
  The Working Methods of the Ma Hengchang Group Are Applicable to Various Regions and Industries
    Facts have proved that the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group—the mass working method of production groups—is not only applicable to the mechanical industry, but also to other industries. Because the establishment of a responsibility system, the formulation of group plans and individual plans, the inspection of the first piece of work, the improvement of quality to ensure the completion and exceeding of tasks, the rapid improvement of workers' technical level, and the strengthening of worker unity and mutual assistance are the common requirements of advanced producers in all industrial sectors. For example, the first batch of model groups that emerged in Shenyang, Andong and other places not only included the machinery industry, but also the grain processing industry, municipal enterprises, the chemical industry, and the rubber industry, all of which created excellent results. Therefore, the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group is applicable to all industries and throughout the country.
  Methods of Promoting the Ma Hengchang Group
    The method of promoting the Ma Hengchang Group's production method in the Northeast is to combine widespread calls with in-depth on-site key training of typical examples. For example, Shenyang is taking the approach of combining it with current production requirements, starting with the most important departments in the production process. The experimental factory focuses on the steelmaking plant, and the steelmaking plant focuses on the lathe group of the repair shop; the smelting plant focuses on the roasting furnace. Andong focuses on the main workshops, first promoting it in backward groups or general groups, which has yielded good results. Because once backward and general groups are mobilized, as long as they take a step forward on the original basis, it will inevitably stimulate the advancement of advanced or other groups. At the same time, the leadership promptly summarizes and promotes experience, thereby promoting the entire workshop or factory (Note: The so-called "backward group" does not refer to backward technology or equipment conditions, but rather that the potential strength of the masses has not been well utilized due to the lack of assistance from the leadership in the past). In each industry and in each factory, there must be advanced production groups that are more suitable for the characteristics of their own departments, and there must be their own specific examples, so that the production work of the masses has a clear and specific direction and goal.
  Prevent Formalism and Mechanical Application
    In the movement to learn from the Ma Hengchang production group, it is necessary to prevent formalism. Simply learning and comparing from the form is not acceptable. In the Northeast, there were also individual factories that were complacent because their conditions in all aspects were superior, and they believed that they were stronger than the Ma Hengchang Group. This view is wrong. Learning from the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group is to learn its basic spirit, to raise specific methods through the masses' awareness, combined with the actual situation of the factory and the group, so as to enrich the experience of the Ma Hengchang Group and improve production, which does not depend on the amount of conditions. Therefore, the idea of swallowing the Ma Hengchang Group's systems and methods whole, forgetting the specific actual situation of the group, and being eager for quick success will lead to failure or a formalistic result.
  Complacency and Conservative Views Are the Greatest Enemies of Learning Advanced Experience
    After learning from the Ma Hengchang Group and achieving certain results, it is necessary to prevent complacency and the narrow views of conservatism. For example, some groups and even leading cadres believe that they have their own set of methods and do not need to learn from the Ma Hengchang Group. Some groups even learn advanced methods but dare not admit that they learned them, insisting that they created them themselves. This kind of blind complacency is actually the resistance of backward thinking to advanced experience. This is the greatest enemy in promoting the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang Group, and it is also the greatest enemy in our industrial construction.

　　东北各地各产业各厂矿
    普遍推广马恒昌小组先进经验
    已出现二五七个模范小组解决了推广中几个思想问题
    【本报讯】特约通讯员李痴报道：今年四月，东北总工会号召推广马恒昌小组经验以来，东北各省市各产业已逐渐展开，并获得初步成绩。至七月中旬，据不完全统计，已出现二百五十七个模范小组。由于学习了马恒昌小组的经验，这些小组在生产中都成了保证完成与超过任务、提高质量、节省原料、爱护机器、贯彻责任制、加强职工团结的好榜样。如沈阳机器三厂四部床身组，学习了马恒昌小组先进经验后，四月份提前十二天完成全月任务，质量提高五至十倍，并建立了四种图表（小组分工个人计划进度表，生产分工任务表，质量成绩比较表，负责成绩检查表），对全厂各个车间都起了推动作用。
  马恒昌小组的工作方法适用于各地各产业部门
    事实证明：马恒昌小组先进经验——生产小组的群众性的工作方法，不仅适用于机械工业，也适用于其他产业部门。因建立责任制，订立小组计划和个人计划、检查头件活、提高质量保证完成与超过任务，迅速提高工友技术水平、加强职工团结互助等，是所有工业部门的先进生产者的共同要求。如沈阳、安东等地出现的第一批模范小组，不仅有机械工业，还有粮食加工业、市政企业、化学业、橡胶业，都创造了优良的成绩。因此，马恒昌小组的先进经验，适用于各项工业及全国各地。
  推广马恒昌小组的方法
    在东北推广马恒昌小组式的生产的方法，是采用广泛号召和深入现场重点培养典型相结合。如沈阳是采取与目前生产要求相结合，从生产过程中最重要的部门着手。试验厂以炼钢厂为重点，该厂又以修理场车工组为重点；冶炼厂则以焙烧炉为重点。安东则以主要车间为重点，先在落后组或一般组中推行，收效良好。因为落后与一般小组动起来以后，只要在原有基础上前进一步，必然会刺激先进或其他小组前进，同时领导上及时总结和推广经验，因而推动了全车间或全厂（按：所谓“落后组”，并不是指技术或设备条件落后，而是指由于领导上过去缺少帮助，使群众的潜在力量没有很好的发挥的组）。在每一产业中，每一工厂里，都要有更适合于自己部门特点的先进生产小组，都要有自己的具体榜样，使群众生产工作有明确具体的方向和目标。
  防止形式主义机械搬运
    在学习马恒昌生产小组运动中，要防止形式主义。单纯的从形式上去学、去比是不行的。在东北也曾有个别厂以为自己的各方面条件比较优越而自满，认为比马恒昌小组要强，这样看法是不对的。学习马恒昌小组先进经验，是学习其基本精神，通过群众觉悟性，结合本厂本组的实际情况，提出具体办法，使马恒昌小组经验更加丰富起来，把生产提高一步，不在于条件的多寡。因此，囫囵吞枣的机械搬用马恒昌小组的制度和办法，忘记了本组具体实际情况，急于求成的思想，都会造成失败或是形式主义结果。
  自满情绪和保守观点是学习先进经验最大敌人
    在学习马恒昌小组，获得一定成绩之后，要防止自满情绪和保守主义的狭隘观点。如有的小组甚至领导干部以为自己有了一套，用不着向马恒昌小组学习。甚至有的小组学习了先进方法，但不敢承认是学来的，硬说是自己创造的。这种盲目的自满思想，实际是落后思想对先进经验的抗拒，这是推广马恒昌小组先进经验的最大敌人，也是我们工业建设中最大的敌人。
