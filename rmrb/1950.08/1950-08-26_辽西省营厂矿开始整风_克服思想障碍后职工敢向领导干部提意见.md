　　Rectification Campaign Begins in Liaoxi Provincial State-Operated Factories and Mines
　　Overcoming Ideological Obstacles Enables Workers to Offer Opinions to Leading Cadres
　　[This newspaper, Liaoxi News] The factories and mines in Liaoxi Province have begun rectification campaigns. After repeated mobilization and removal of ideological obstacles, workers have begun to correct their attitude towards rectification and have increased their confidence in inspecting and improving work. Since the closing of the fourth joint conference of mine and factory directors convened by the Provincial Department of Industry, factories and mines have launched rectification movements. General meetings of all factory workers were convened successively to convey the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee regarding rectification and the requirements for rectification at the joint conference. With the Standing Committee of the Workers Management Committee as the backbone, relevant responsible cadres were absorbed to form a central group to lead the rectification movement. In the rectification, the leaders of various factories and mines can generally grasp the principle of combining leadership with the masses and combining work inspection with document study, focusing on inspecting the important issues of their own units. For example, the Construction Company inspected the inaccurate design of projects and the waste in construction, examining the past economic accounting and the ideology of implementing policies, and mobilized all factory workers to boldly offer opinions.

　　However, at the beginning of the rectification, some ideological obstacles were encountered. Some leading cadres of factories and mines believed that there was nothing to rectify in their units; others emphasized the busyness of production, producing the idea of ​​disregarding rectification. Among some workers, there were many ideological concerns: some people thought that this rectification was the same as the previous democratic congress, allowing everyone to offer opinions and then it would be over! Nothing can be resolved. An individual employee said: "Giving opinions to managers and factory directors is the business of section chiefs; if we offer them, we will be in trouble in the future (meaning we will be retaliated against)." Other employees said: "Now it is about rectifying the leaders, but we are the ones who do the specific things in the future, wouldn't they turn around and rectify us!" Therefore, employees and workers were not very bold in speaking, not saying everything they knew, but offering abstract opinions instead of concrete things; or offering opinions about the past instead of the present; offering small opinions instead of big ones.

　　In response to this situation, some units have conducted further mobilization by enterprise leaders, explaining that rectification is to achieve the purpose of improving work and doing a good job in production through inspection and summary of work, calling on all employees to be responsible for offering more opinions in the rectification, and everyone to work hard to run the factory well, and re-announced guarantees not to retaliate, and will definitely answer all questions, and solve problems that can be solved. As a result, the enthusiasm of workers in various factories and mines began to rise, and they increased their confidence in this rectification.

　　辽西省营厂矿开始整风
    克服思想障碍后职工敢向领导干部提意见
    【本报辽西讯】辽西省各厂矿已开始整风。经过再次动员，解除思想障碍之后，职工们已开始端正整风的态度，提高了对检查改进工作的信心。自省工业厅召开的第四次矿厂长联席会议闭幕后，各厂矿开展了整风运动。先后召开了全厂职工大会，传达了省委关于整风的精神，及联席会议上的整风要求。以工管会常委为中坚，吸收有关负责干部参加组成中心小组，领导整风运动。在整风中，各厂矿领导上一般都能掌握领导与群众相结合，检查工作与学习文件相结合的原则，抓住本单位的重要问题进行检查，如建设公司从检查工程的设计不精确，施工中的浪费现象中，检查过去的经济核算及贯彻政策的思想，并发动全厂职工群众大胆提意见。
    但在整风开始之初，也曾遇到一些思想障碍，有的厂矿领导干部认为本单位没有什么可以整的；有的则强调生产忙，产生轻视整风的思想。在有些职工中，则存在着许多思想顾虑：如有人认为这次整风与过去民主大会一样，让大家提提意见就过去啦！不能解决什么问题。有个别职员说：“给经理厂长提意见，是科长们的事；咱们要提，以后吃不了兜着走（意即要受打击）。”还有的职员说：“现在是整领导，将来具体事是咱们做的，反过来还不得整咱们！”因此职员与工友们发言还不大胆，不是有啥说啥，而是提些抽象意见，不提具体事；或者是提过去的，不提现在的；提小的，不提大的。
    根据这样情况，有些单位均由企业负责人进行了再次动员，说明整风是通过检查与总结工作，以达改进工作搞好生产的目的，号召全体职工有责在整风中多提意见，大家努力办好工厂，并重新宣布保证不报复，一定做到有问必答，能解决的问题一定解决，从而各厂矿职工情绪开始高涨，对这次整风提高了信心。
