　　Rapid Completion of Summer Grain Collection
　　Linfen Prefecture, Shanxi, Praised
　　[This newspaper] In the grain collection work throughout Shanxi Province, Linfen Prefecture was commended by the provincial government for completing its task relatively quickly and gaining some good experience.
　　The nine counties in the plains area of ​​Linfen Prefecture, from the start of collection to July 5th, collected more than 32 million catties of public grain in ten days, accounting for 80 percent of the amount to be borne by the nine counties. Among them, Hongtong County completed more than 97 percent, and most of the remaining arrears and old debts have also been concentrated in the villages. The main experiences gained in the work are as follows: First, all levels established public grain collection committees headed by responsible comrades of the administration and the Party committee to unify leadership and transfer a large number of cadres. The leaders personally led the effort and went deep into districts and villages to inspect and supervise. For example, the Linfen County Chief personally went to the countryside for inspection. The county also compiled and printed work newsletters during the summer grain collection work to exchange experience and correct deviations in a timely manner.
　　The second is to vigorously publicize policies, clear up thinking, and have cadres and Party members take the lead in breaking through backward villages and setting off a mass upsurge in grain delivery. For example, after understanding the policies, the masses in Bian Village, Linfen, completed the task in one and a half days, transforming from a backward village in the past to an advanced village, which the masses felt very honored. Pei Fude, a Party member in a certain village in Linfen, Qu Songshan, a fifth-grade village teacher, and Li Xingdou, a representative of military dependents, took the lead in paying off their own public grain first. Under their influence, they not only completed the new task in three days but also cleared 3,200 catties of old debts. For another example, district cadres in Zhaocheng County patiently publicized policies and broke the masses’ historical procrastination mentality. For example, Cao Tianshun's mother, a martyr's family member in Hou Village, used to procrastinate and refused to pay, but this year she took the lead. Also, after a cadre in the county inspected and corrected the over-allocation of public grain in Wu Village, the masses' enthusiasm for grain delivery was high, and they not only quickly completed the new task but were also clearing up old arrears. The third is that leading cadres combining production, clearly dividing responsibilities, and taking charge also played a significant role in completing the task this time. For example, the civil affairs committee member of Chenghuang Village, Linfen County, organized vehicles, the Communist Youth League branch secretary organized youth to transport grain, the armed forces committee member organized militiamen to escort, the women's federation chairman inspected and supervised each household, the finance and grain manager kept accounts, and others were hired to weigh the grain, with the village head and branch secretary being responsible for overall management. This allows the work to proceed in an orderly manner. The masses can also appropriately divide labor among the old, young, women, and children, so that grain delivery does not interfere with production. For example, in Xiceti Village, the young and middle-aged transport grain in the morning, while the elderly and women prepare the land, and in the afternoon, they concentrate all their efforts on rushing to change the stubble.
　　In addition, in the grain collection work, the prefecture also used top-down persuasion and mobilization to correct the "privilege" mentality of some cadres who considered themselves meritorious to the revolution and refused to pay burdens on the pretext of family difficulties, overcoming the phenomenon of arrears over the years. After the special office seriously handled and persuaded individual masses who resisted the burden in conjunction with the provincial government's instructions, all households with arrears have also paid them off one after another.
　　This summer grain collection, due to top-down persuasion and mobilization, not only enabled cadres to develop a high degree of work enthusiasm but also educated cadres through facts, making them realize that coercive methods cannot smoothly complete the task. For example, Chengzicun Village in the third district of Qingyuan County, Fenyang Prefecture, had the most arrears in grain collection in the past years. Therefore, many village cadres cited many examples at cadre meetings to show that it was impossible to complete the task without coercion. After analysis and research, everyone believed that the reason for the arrears in the past was that district cadres did not pay attention to this and did not strengthen the leadership of the entire work, so that the masses thought that arrears of public grain did not matter. After criticism, it was emphasized that political mobilization should be carried out seriously to reverse the mentality of arrears. As a result, from the start of collection on July 13 to the 17th, 95 percent of the original task had been completed in five days, and under the leadership of Party and Communist Youth League members, no major deviations occurred. This example shows that the collection method of coercion, which is divorced from the masses, not only cannot quickly complete the task but delays or hinders the completion of the task.

　　迅速完成夏征工作
    山西临汾专区受表扬
    【本报讯】山西全省各地征粮工作中，临汾专区曾以完成任务较快，并取得一些好的经验而受到省府通报表扬。
    临汾专区平原地区九个县，从开征到七月五日，先后十天中，即征起公粮三千二百多万斤，占该九县应负担数的百分之八十。其中洪洞县完成百分之九十七以上，少数尾欠与旧欠亦已大部集中在村。至于工作中所获得的主要经验，有下面几点：首先，各级都以行政、党委负责同志为首，成立了公粮征收委员会，统一领导，并大批抽调干部，由首长亲自领导，深入区村检查督促。如临汾县长即亲自下乡检查。该县并在夏征工作进行中，编印工作通讯，及时交流经验，纠正偏向。
    再就是大力宣传政策，打通思想，由干部、党员带头，突破落后村，掀起群众交粮热潮。如临汾边村群众在了解了政策后，一天半时间即完成了任务，由过去的落后村一跃而变成先进村，群众觉得很光荣。临汾某村党员裴福德，伍级村教员瞿松山，军属代表李星斗等，带头先交清自己公粮，在他们的影响下，不仅三天完成了新任务，并扫清了旧欠三千二百余斤。再如赵城县区干部耐心的宣传政策，打破了群众有历史性的拖拉思想。如侯村烈属曹天顺之母，过去拖拉不交，今年却打了头炮。又如该县某干部检查与纠正了吴村多派公粮后，群众交粮情绪高涨，不仅很快完成了新任务，而且正在清理旧尾欠中。再是领导干部结合生产，明确分工负责，对这次完成任务也起了很大作用。如临汾县城隍村民政委员组织车辆，团支书组织青年运粮，武装委员组织民兵护送，妇联主席逐户检查督促，财粮管账，另外聘人过秤，村长、支书负责全面。这样使工作可以有条不紊的进行。群众也能做到老少妇女适当分工，使交粮不误生产。如西厕堤村青壮年上午运粮，老汉妇女整地，下午集中全力，突击改茬。
    另外，该专区在征粮工作中，并以自上而下的说服动员，纠正了部分干部自认为对革命有功，借口家庭困难，不交负担的“特权”思想，克服了历年来的拖欠现象。有个别群众抵抗负担的，经专署结合省府指示认真处理与说服动员后，凡有尾欠的各户，也已纷纷交清。
    这次夏征，由于自上而下的经过说服动员，不仅使干部发扬了高度的工作积极性，同时并通过事实教育了干部，使他们认识到强迫命令的作法，并不能顺利完成任务。如汾阳专区清源县，过去三区城子村历年在征粮中都是尾欠最多的，故有许多村干部在干部会上举出许多例子说明不用强迫命令就完不成任务，后经大家分析研究，认为过去之所以有拖欠，是区干部对此未加重视，对整个工作的领导也没有加强，使群众在思想上认为拖欠公粮不要紧所致。经批判后，强调指出，要认真进行政治动员，扭转拖欠思想。执行结果，从七月十三日开征到十七日五天中，即已完成了原任务百分之九十五，且在党、团员带头下，并未发生大的偏差。这个例子，说明了强迫命令的脱离群众的征收方式不但不能迅速完成任务，反而延缓或妨碍了任务的完成。
