To facilitate telephone installation for private industry and commerce, and private residences, the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau has implemented a method of paying installation and deposit fees in three installments since August 1st. Many users have applied for telephone installation, and many have already been installed. Now, to further facilitate users, the bureau is expanding the scope of installment payment for telephone installation. The original regulation limited the scope of telephone installation to those within the basic business area, and the required material distance could not exceed 150 meters. Now, this restriction has been lifted. Also, the original regulation only applied to the installation of ordinary telephone main lines or extension lines. Now, it has been changed to apply to the installation of dedicated lines, small switchboards, and branch lines. The deadline for installment payments is three months, and the installation can be completed after the first installment is paid.

Furthermore, the bureau has also made new improvements to the method of calculating material costs for new telephone installations and relocation of telephones outside the home. The original regulation stipulated that the material cost was calculated based on the distance from the distribution box to the designated telephone installation location. The new method is that if there are old open wires that can be used within this distance, the material cost for this section of wire can be waived. If old users who have recently had their phones removed still need to install a phone, please apply for reinstallation as soon as possible, to avoid having someone else take advantage of the existing open wire. If that happens, you will have to spend a lot of money on materials when you apply for installation in the future. At the same time, if the phone number you used in the past has not been taken by other new users, you can still choose the original number and avoid paying the number selection fee.

　　便利工商业装设电话  北京电信局改进收费办法
    北京电信局对于私营工商业，私人住宅，新装电话可分三期缴付装机费和押机费的办法自八月一日施行以来，申请按装电话的用户很多，已经装妥的也不少。现该局为进一步便利用户起见，对于分期缴费装设电话的范围再行扩大，原来规定装设电话范围以在基本营业区域以内者为限，且所需材料距离不得超过一五○公尺，现已将此项限制取消，又原来规定只以装设普通电话正机或副机为限，现改为请装专线、小交换机、分机亦都可以适用此项办法了，分期缴费的限期是三个月，把第一期的费用缴清以后就可以装机。
    又，该局对于新装电话和宅外迁移电话计算材料费的办法又有新的改进，原来规定是由分线箱起至指定装设电话的位置止，以这一段距离来计算材料费，新的办法是这一段距离内如果有旧的明线可以利用时，这段线的材料费就可以免收了。凡是最近拆机的旧用户，如果还需要按装电话，请赶快去申请复装，免得此项既设明线被人捷足先登，将来自己申请装设时又要花好多的材料费。同时如果过去所用的号码，尚未被其他新用户占用时，仍可选用原来的号码，免缴选号费。
