　　Han Yongfu and Others in Anyang Fengfeng Mining Area
    Carelessly Sealing a Mine Nearly Caused Fatalities
    Local People's Government Should Impose Legal Sanctions
    The Gongyi Slope South Kiln in Bate Village, Fengfeng Mining Area, is a joint venture between the Anyang Military Sub-district and private individuals; the Victory Slope North Kiln is a collective venture of the villagers. The two kilns share a ventilation shaft. The North Kiln is well-managed and highly profitable. The South Kiln has a less abundant coal seam and is poorly managed, losing 47,000 jin of rice. Therefore, the South Kiln wanted to sell its assets to the North Kiln or merge with it, but the North Kiln did not agree. Recently, the South Kiln trespassed and mined beyond its boundaries, which was stopped by the North Kiln, so relations between the two sides were very poor. Han Yongfu, the manager of the South Kiln, and his deputy, Suo Zifang, attempted to seal the kiln (meaning to block the mine entrance). Although they had discussed this with the district office and village cadres, they did not get consent. After returning, they carelessly made preparations to "seal the kiln." At about 6:00 a.m. on June 19, they led workers Li Benzhi and Zhao Guilin to the mine entrance with furniture and equipment. After all the workers from the North Kiln had gone down into the mine, Han Yongfu and others "sealed" the entrance of the South Kiln (at the time, worker Li Benzhi said, "Sealing it will kill people!" but he was rebuked by Han and Suo). About half an hour later (just as the workers had dispersed to the roadways), the workers underground noticed a lack of ventilation (the lamp flames pointed upwards, voices changed, and breathing became difficult) and shouted to get out. At this time, some workers had their mouths open, eyes wide, and limbs shaking, unable to speak. With the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship among the miners, everyone finally ran to the wellhead. After being rescued with ropes, seven people collapsed due to suffocation, their bodies cold, and most were unconscious. A few workers who could still move, in extreme anger and unbearable frustration, ran to the South Kiln to question Han Yongfu, Suo Zifang, and others, but Han said, "What does it matter if eight or ten die?!" Amid the workers' and families' outrage, they shouted to beat them, but fortunately, district and village cadres were present and tried their best to stop them, preventing fatalities.

    After the incident, the Fengfeng Mining Area People's Government mobilized cadres to collect opinions on how to handle the matter, visited the workers and their families door-to-door to express condolences, and convened meetings of village cadres, workers (including workers from both the North and South Kilns), and mass meetings to explain the government's attitude and handling methods for the incident:

    (1) The South Kiln manager Han Yongfu, deputy manager Suo Zifang, and others should be subject to legal sanctions.

    (2) The Anyang Military Sub-district is requested to state its attitude towards the incident and propose suggestions for handling the aftermath.

    (3) The South Kiln shall be responsible for compensating the injured workers for medical treatment and medical expenses, as well as the wage losses of workers from both the North and South Kilns.

    (4) Cadres and workers who actively and responsibly rescued the workers will be commended.
                Fengfeng Mining Area People's Government

　　安阳峰峰矿区韩永福等
    随便棚窑险伤人命
    当地人民政府应予法律制裁
    峰峰矿区八特村公益坡南窑，系由安阳军分区与私人合营；胜利坡北窑则系该村群众集股合营。两窑合用一通风道。北窑因经营好，获利较大。南窑煤层不丰，加之经营较差，赔米四七○○○斤。因此，南窑愿将窑产卖给北窑，或与北窑合营，但北窑不同意。最近南窑曾越界侵采遭北窑制止，于是双方关系很不好。南窑经理韩永福与副经理索子方企图棚窑（把窑口封住的意思）。他们虽曾向区公所、村干部商讨，但未获同意。他们回去后却随便做了“棚窑”的准备。六月十九日晨六时许他们率工人李本之、赵桂林携带家具器材前往窑口。待北窑工人全部下窑后，韩永福等即将南窑口“棚住”（当时工人李本之说：“棚了可要毙死人啊！”当遭韩等二人斥责）约半小时后（工人刚分散开至行道间），窑下工人发觉断风（灯头向上，说话音变，呼吸困难），即喊叫外出。此时，有的工人张嘴瞪眼，四肢摇晃，不能说话。在矿工互助友爱的精神下，大家终于跑至井口。用绳子把他们救上来后，七人因窒息躺倒，身体发凉，多数昏迷不醒。少数尚能走动的工人在万分气恨，难以忍耐的情况下，跑到南窑，责问韩永福、索子方等，可是韩说：“死十个八个的不要紧？！”在工人及家属群众激愤之下，齐声喊打，幸有区村干部在场，竭力阻止，未闹出人命。
    事情发生后，峰峰矿区人民政府乃动员干部分头搜集对此事的处理意见，并挨门挨户慰问工人及其家属，又召开了村干部会、工人会（南北窑工人均参加）及群众大会，说明政府对此次事件的态度及处理方法：
    （一）南窑经理韩永福、副经理索子方等应予法律制裁。
    （二）请安阳军分区表明对此次事件的态度，并提出处理善后问题的意见。
    （三）受伤工人之疗养及医药费及南北两窑工人之工资损失，均应由南窑负责赔偿。
    （四）对积极负责抢救工人的干部、工人予以表扬。
                峰峰矿区人民政府
