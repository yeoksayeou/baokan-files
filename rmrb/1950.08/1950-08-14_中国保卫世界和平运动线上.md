The four administrations of Jinan, Taiyuan, Tianjin, and Hengyang have also had 130,000 people participate in the signing.
　　Tian Guiying, a female driver of the Dalian "March 8th" team, not only participated in the signing but also firmly stated: "We must do a good job in the transportation business for the construction of a new China and use practical actions to defend peace."

An old villager in Nanhua Village said: "I was robbed clean by the Kuomintang in the past, but now things are going well, and I bought a new cart. Damn it, the Americans want to fight again. I'll sign my name to protect my new cart."
　　Comrade Liu Zhengming, a cadre of the Health Department of the North China Military Region Sanatorium, who lost his right arm in the war after 22 years of revolution, signed his name with his left hand and wrote: "The enemy knocked off my right hand in the war.

For example, the entire section of citizens in the Eighth Branch of the Second District of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has only over 8,000 people, but in one week they mobilized more than 35,000 people to participate in the signing. Most touching was the fact that two white-haired old ladies, Gao Maoquan, 51, and Zhang Yangshi, 55, in the district, collected signatures back and forth from Longevity Hill to the city center under the scorching sun. Finally, these two old heroes collected a total of more than 8,200 signatures, reaching the highest record.

　　Wang Zhenqing, a soldier of the Fourth Company of a certain unit of the North China Military Region, sang in a ballad poem: "Today we signed our names, to defend world peace forever. If imperialism dares to challenge, we will resolutely eliminate them without mercy."
