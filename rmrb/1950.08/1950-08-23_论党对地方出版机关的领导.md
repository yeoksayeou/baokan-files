　　On the Party's Leadership over Local Publishing Houses
    Soviet Union · K. Bogomolov H. Logivonov

    The communist education of the masses is the most important condition for our country's victorious advance towards communism. The Bolshevik Party is carrying out enormous work in the ideological education of the working masses, and it is concerned daily with the development of science, literature, and art, and with the establishment of a rich spiritual culture. Books rich in content and correct in orientation play a tremendous role in communist education; books have become a daily necessity for the Soviet people. Books arm the Soviet people with the necessary knowledge to labor more effectively for the well-being of the socialist motherland. Soviet books are a powerful weapon for propagating Marxism-Leninism, mobilizing and organizing the masses to carry out the tasks of economic and cultural construction, and are a weapon in the ideological struggle against the bourgeoisie. The high ideological quality of Soviet literature has won it the love and respect of all honest people in the world.

    The prosperity of the Soviet book publishing industry is a clear indicator of the rapid development of our culture. In the years since the establishment of Soviet power, we have published approximately one million titles, with a total circulation of 12.6 billion copies, of which 802 million were classic works of Marxism-Leninism. The "Short Course on the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)," first published in 1938, has been printed 234 times in 66 languages, with a circulation of approximately 35 million copies. The circulation of scientific and literary books is even more enormous. In 1949 alone, 683 million copies of books and pamphlets were published, more than one and a half times the number published in 1940. Such a grand scale of publishing is unmatched by any capitalist country.

    Two-thirds of the Soviet book publishing organs are distributed in the republics, border regions, and provinces (for example, Ukraine has 22 publishing houses, the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic has 16 publishing houses, etc.). All of these publishing houses mainly publish books in their native languages, thereby promoting the development of culture with national forms and socialist content. Due to the high level of culture of all nationalities in the Soviet Union and the strengthening of local publishing houses, our country has been able to publish books in 119 languages. Forty nationalities, which had no written language in the past, now have written languages and books. In places where almost all residents were illiterate before the Great October Socialist Revolution, the works of Lenin and Stalin, classical Russian writers, and outstanding Soviet writers are now published in their native languages.

    Native language translations of the works of Lenin and Stalin have now been published in all union republics. Native language translations of the works of Stalin are also being published in the Tatar and Yakut Autonomous Republics. In the union republics, autonomous republics, and autonomous provinces, more than 40 publishing houses have issued individual works of Marxist-Leninist classics in their native languages.

    The constant leadership of party organizations over all book publishing organs is a necessary condition for the smooth operation of all publishing organs. In recent years, party organizations, based on the resolutions of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on ideological issues, have greatly improved the leadership of the work of publishing organs. The central committees of the communist parties of the union republics and the district and provincial committees of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) have begun to study in depth the content and themes of published books in order to improve the ideological, artistic, and scientific level and perfect the form of books. The number of writers in the republics, border regions, and provinces is increasing, and their creative abilities are gradually improving; the work of local writers' associations has been greatly enlivened. In recent years, many works of Soviet literature that have been awarded the Stalin Prize have emerged in various parts of the country. For example, B. Popova's "Steel and Slag" and N. Bokryach's "Blue Lotus," first published by the Stalin Province Publishing Bureau of the Ukrainian Republic, are now being read in every corner of the Soviet Union.

    The achievements of local publishing organs should be consolidated and expanded. The cultural demands of the Soviet people are increasing day by day, and the number of books published in all knowledge sectors must be greatly increased, and its quality must be further improved. Party organizations should constantly lead the work of publishing organs, study in depth every aspect of the business, from signing contracts with writers to conducting publicity and distribution work among the broad masses of Soviet readers. The basic task of the publishing organs of the republics, border regions, and provinces is to attract local authors to publish highly ideological, rich in content books on local life themes. There are still many shortcomings in the work of publishing organs in this regard. Publishing organs publish very few popular books that summarize the experiences of advanced producers in industry and agriculture in the republics, border regions, and provinces, and the popularization of existing technological achievements in various sectors of the national economy and the creative cooperation of science and production is not done well enough. Often, books that introduce advanced agricultural producers only describe what major achievements have been made, but do not explain how these achievements were obtained.

    Many publishing organs are happy to reprint literary books published in Moscow, but the organizational work of local writers is very weak. They often reprint creations that have already been published in literary magazines and included in anthologies in the same way, without making necessary corrections. Some have published many narrow parochial and non-urgent books and periodicals; this is wrong. The books published by local publishing organs often have incomprehensible text and poor form.

    Party organizations should help publishing organs eliminate all these shortcomings. The provincial and district committees of the party should seriously lead the work of publishing organs. For example, the Coastal District Committee Bureau of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) only approved the editorial plan in its leadership of the publishing organs last year. For example, when the Central Bureau of the Moldavian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) discussed individual publishing issues in 1949, it did not pass a comprehensive resolution on the work of publishing organs, including criticism of published books and decisions to further lead the publishing work. However, the party committees should not only study individual issues of publishing work, but also thoroughly analyze the entire work of publishing organs.

    Facts prove that without the constant leadership of the party in the work of publishing organs, the ideological, scientific, and artistic level of publications will be very low. The example of the North Ossetian Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) committing serious errors in the leadership of ideological work in the province, especially in the leadership of local publishing organs, provides us with a lesson. A group of people headed by Zaitsev, director of the North Ossetian State Publishing Bureau, and Mamsulov, chairman of the Republican Writers Association, monopolized the publication of republican publications and hindered young writers from entering the publishing world because the provincial committee was indifferent to the publishing business. Why did the North Ossetian Provincial Committee not see the serious shortcomings in the publishing work? The reason is that some workers in the provincial committee are themselves unskilled editors, and at the same time, they are the people who supply manuscripts of little value. Although the North Ossetian Provincial Committee is responsible for supervising the publishing business of the republic, they conceal the shortcomings in the publishing business.

    Party organs should pay serious attention to the design issues of publishing work. Whether the publishing work is successful or not mainly depends on whether the editorial plan for each year is formulated correctly. Soviet publishing cannot be allowed to drift: it must organize the publishing and preparation of books that meet the requirements of readers in terms of content. In order to correctly formulate the editorial plan, it is necessary to constantly study these requirements, synthesize book reviews, and be familiar with the urgent tasks of party and government work and economic construction in the republic, border region, and province. Only after taking all of this into account can the publishing organs correctly formulate the editorial plan. However, many publishing organs formulate plans simply by working behind closed doors, often mechanically listing accidentally received manuscripts and themes drafted by writers themselves.

    In recent years, the editorial plans of local publishing organs have been formulated better: they are closer to reality and production. However, there are still major shortcomings in the plans of individual publishing organs for 1950. For example, the scope of political book themes is very narrow; there are too many historical themes; the plan does not fully reflect urgent issues, especially economic issues. There are very few plans to publish books that summarize the experiences of outstanding producers in industry and agriculture in the republic, border region, and province, and books that popularize scientific and technological achievements and the experience of party work. Many publishing organs do not adequately value the importance of books on local customs. The plans of most publishing organs in the union republics and autonomous republics include very few literary works of Russian classical writers and Soviet writers who have won the Stalin Prize to be translated into their native languages. In the plan, the portion of so-called "other" publications is too large; and in this portion, many unsaleable books are often listed. When formulating the editorial plan, the wishes of the masses of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals must be taken into account. In particular, the experience of organizing manuscript discussion meetings for writers in enterprises, collective farms, state farms, and among intellectuals has proven that the participants in the discussion meetings often make important revisions to the content of the books and provide valuable instructions to the writers.

    Some publishing organs send plans that have not yet been prepared to the party's provincial and district committees, and they immediately approve these plans, which has become a formality. Naturally, in this way, the shortcomings in the plan cannot be discovered and corrected. If the Mordovian Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) could seriously study the content of the republic's publishing plan for 1950 when approving it, then it would be able to discover the serious errors in this plan. For example, the publishing organs, for some reason, did not plan to publish popular political books with local life as the theme in this year's plan. The publishing organs ignored readers' interest in excellent books by Soviet writers: only one book by a Stalin Prize winner was planned to be published in the Moksha language, and not even one in the Erzya language. The plan did not include publications on many urgent issues of the republic's agriculture. Although there were these shortcomings in the plan, the provincial committee bureau approved it without modification.

    It is correct for some party committees to pay attention to the content of books scheduled to be published before approving the editorial plan. Party organs seriously reviewing the editorial plan of publishing organs can prevent unnecessary books, or even bad books, from being published.

    In our country, the necessary conditions have been established for the development of publishing. The leadership of this cultural field is concentrated in the unified alliance central organ—the General Administration of Press, Publication, and Distribution of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. There are printing, publishing, and distribution management offices in various places. The General Administration of Press, Publication, and Distribution and its local agencies are responsible for leading the development of the printing industry and publishing and distribution throughout the Soviet Union.

    The party and the Soviet government provide great help to local publishing organs, supplying them with paper and binding materials, and allocating the necessary funds. The obligation of the staff of publishing organs and printing factories is to make good use of the government's assistance.

    Soviet books should have high quality in printing form. In its resolution on "the printing form of books" (July 1945), the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) charged the managers of publishing organs and the directors of printing factories to personally review the issues of printing form every day, to thoroughly study and decide on the artistic design, format, page margin size, page area, typeface and font size, the quality of printing and binding work of books, and to attract highly skilled artists to participate in the art work of books.

    The printing and artistic form of our books has been greatly improved. Publishing organs have accumulated a lot of experience in this regard, and the number of illustrators and book designers has increased. The exhibition of books, illustrations, and posters recently held in Moscow by the General Administration of Press, Publication, and Distribution proved that printing and publishing workers have done a large-scale work under the instructions of the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). It is gratifying that many local publishing organs are no less than the central publishing organs in terms of the quality of book form. However, we should not be satisfied with the existing achievements. In order to improve the printing and artistic form of books, we still have to put in a lot of effort.

    The editorial committee plays a major role in improving the quality of books. The tasks of the editorial committee have been determined in the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in July 1946 on "the work of the State Joint Publishing Bureau of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic." The editorial committees are responsible for reviewing the work plans of publishing organs and examining the manuscripts received by various publishing organs. The managers of various publishing organs should publish various manuscripts only after they have been discussed by the editorial committee. The work of the editorial committees of many publishing organs in Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and other republics has been quite successful.

    The most important condition for improving the level of publications is the correct selection of publishing staff. Special attention should be paid to the selection of leading cadres of publishing organs—managers and editors-in-chief. The editors who are directly responsible for the preparation of books play a major role; in order to perfectly edit a book and help writers, the editors should have extensive knowledge. However, some publishing organs do not seriously select editors. We can see the same editor's name in political, literary, agricultural, medical, and other books. How can a person without considerable accomplishment edit books? Every publishing organ has the possibility of attracting experts in individual knowledge sectors to edit books. At the same time, the editorial staff should improve their professional and political level every day.

    Unfortunately, there are often some people who cannot be trusted who invade the editing and publishing work departments. This phenomenon occurs where the party does not supervise the selection of cadres. The books produced by this kind of publishing organ are always quite bad, which has become a rule. The example of the Estonian State Publishing Bureau committing serious errors in its work can illustrate this point.

    Translating Russian books into the languages of all nationalities in the Soviet Union is a matter that the state should be responsible for. The high quality of translation is necessary for any kind of book—political, literary, scientific and technological. Local publishing organs bear the major responsibility of ensuring that books translated from various languages do not lose the spirit of the original book. This can only be achieved under the condition of seriously selecting translation and editing cadres and constantly perfecting the leadership of publishing work by party organizations.

    The translation work of political, literary, and scientific and technological books has not yet reached the realm of perfection everywhere. Some party organizations do not lead this work adequately. In many republics, the translation work is entrusted to unselected people with low political levels, who do not fully understand Russian and have no translation experience.

    Many shortcomings have been found in the Uzbek translations of Marxist-Leninist classics. In Uzbekistan, the works of Lenin and Stalin are translated by unselected people who do not have enough skilled experience. Although the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Uzbekistan received news of translation errors and failures in the selection of translation cadres, it did not pay attention to it. After inspection, it was determined that there were serious errors in many Uzbek translations of Marxist-Leninist classics. The terminology used in the books was not unified. The translators insisted on translating into Uzbek those sentences that have become common to all languages, and as a result, they translated well-known political terms into feudal religious words that distorted the meaning of these terms.

    From the situation where the literary book translation work in the Estonian Republic is undertaken by uneducated, unselected people, we can understand what serious consequences will be caused by not supervising the translation work. The translations of individual books do not match the original, distorting the meaning of the works. There are many serious errors in the Estonian translation of A. Gonchar's novel "Standard Bearers"; Stanislavsky's "My Life in Art" and other books are poorly translated.

    The reason for the serious errors in books translated from Russian into the languages of all nationalities in the Soviet Union is that the translation cadres do not have sufficient accomplishment. Until now, there has been no organized work to train translators in many places. The Ministry of Higher Education should do this work in a planned way. The General Administration of Press, Publication, and Distribution should also be responsible for this work. Training classes for cultivating and improving the proficiency of translators should be established in the language departments of universities and the language departments of normal schools in various places. These training classes should be equipped with the necessary reference books, first of all, national language dictionaries. The publication of national language dictionaries by the Foreign Language and National Language Dictionary Publishing Bureau is very small, and the preparation work of these dictionaries should not be the patent business of a small number of people within a narrow range as we see at present, but should be jointly participated in by broad social groups, schools, and scientific institutions.

    Criticism in newspapers has a major impact on the quality of publications. Modern detailed book reviews can help the work of publishing organs in various places, and can also help readers understand the criticized books.

    Criticism in periodicals is an important means of mass communist education. In its resolution on "Book Reviews and Book Introductions" passed in 1940, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) charged the newspapers to fundamentally improve the work of book review and book introduction columns, and to systematically publish information on new books. The newspapers of the republics, border regions, and provinces were charged to regularly publish new book introductions and reviews of the most important literary works, and to ensure that reviews of books published by local publishing organs were published. However, in some local newspapers, the level of book review and book introduction columns is very low, or there is no such column at all. For example, the "Provincial Worker" newspaper in Ivanovo Province has no book introduction or book review column at all, and very few reviews of books published by the provincial publishing organs are published. In the Rostov Province newspaper "Hammer," very few new book introductions and reviews of books published by local publishing organs are published.

    Local newspapers should constantly improve the quality of book reviews, and objectively and in principle criticize every new book. Gorky said: Criticism should teach us to write articles simply, clearly, and practically. Perfect publicity of books in newspapers is one of the conditions for the successful promotion of books. Not only is the publication of books an important matter, but also sending books to the hands of readers is equally important. Therefore, party organizations should always pay attention to the promotion of books. Many publishing organs are concerned about how to send books to readers. However, there are still such situations: books that have been printed are placed in printing factories, warehouses, bookstores in provincial and republic centers and are not shipped out, while various regions, tractor stations, and collective farms are waiting to read these books.

    Due to the continuous rise of socialist culture, and in order to meet the ever-increasing spiritual needs of the Soviet people, it is necessary to rapidly develop the publishing industry. The task of local party organizations and every party committee is to constantly lead the publishing industry to improve the role of our publications in the struggle for new achievements in the establishment of communism.

　　论党对地方出版机关的领导
    苏联·Ｋ·勃戈莫洛夫  Ｈ·洛吉沃诺夫
    原刊“布尔什维克”一九五○年第十一期
    群众的共产主义教育是我国走向共产主义的胜利运动的最主要条件。布尔什维克党在劳动群众的思想教育方面进行着巨大工作，它每天都在关怀着科学、文学和艺术的发展，关怀着丰富的精神文化的建立。内容丰富而正确的书籍在共产主义教育中起着莫大作用，书籍已成为苏维埃人民的日常必需品了。书籍用那些为了更有效率地为社会主义祖国幸福而劳动的必要知识来武装苏维埃人民。苏维埃书籍是宣传马列主义思想、动员和组织群众去执行经济与文化建设任务的有力武器，是和资产阶级进行思想斗争的武器。苏维埃文学的高度思想性，赢得了世界一切正直人士对于它——苏维埃文学——的爱戴和尊崇。
    苏联书籍出版事业的繁荣，是我国文化迅速发展的明显指标。在苏维埃政权成立后的年代里，我们出版了一百万种左右的书籍，总印数达一百二十六亿册，马列主义经典著作的印数是八亿二百万册。一九三八年最初出版的“联共（布）党史简明教程”，用六十六种文字印行了二百三十四次，印数约在三千五百万册以上。科学和文艺书籍的印数，更非常巨大，一九四九年一年中就出版了六亿八千三百万册书籍和小册子，等于一九四○年出版册数的一倍半以上。出版事业如此宏伟的规模，是任何一个资本主义国家所没有的。
    苏联书籍出版机关的三分之二，分布在各共和国、边区及各省（譬如，乌克兰有二十二个出版机关，乔治亚苏维埃社会主义共和国有十六个出版机关等）。所有这一切出版机关主要是用本族语言来出版书籍的，因而促进了民族形式与社会主义内容的文化的发展。由于苏联各族人民文化的高涨和地方出版机关的加强，我国已经可能用一百一十九种文字来出版书籍。在过去没有自己文字的四十个民族现在已经有了文字和书籍。在伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，几乎全部居民都是文盲的地方，现在已经用本族语言来出版列宁和斯大林、俄罗斯古典文学作家、苏维埃优秀作家的著作了。
    在所有加盟共和国中，现已出版了列宁和斯大林著作的本族语译本。在鞑靼和亚库梯自治共和国，也正在出版斯大林著作的本族语译本。在各加盟共和国、自治共和国和自治省，有四十处以上的出版机关用本族语发行了马列主义经典作家的个别著作。
    各书籍出版机关应由党组织经常领导，这是各出版机关顺利工作的必要条件。最近数年以来，党组织根据联共（布）中央关于思想问题的决议，大大改善了对出版机关工作的领导。各加盟共和国共产党中央、联共（布）区委和省委，已开始深入地研究出版书籍的内容和题材，以提高书籍的思想的、艺术的和科学的水平和完美的形式。各共和国、边区及各省，作家人数日益增加，他们的创作能力逐渐提高；地方作家团体的工作大大活跃起来。最近数年以来，在各地涌现了不少荣膺斯大林奖金的苏维埃文学的作品。譬如，现在苏联各个角落里，都在阅读着乌克兰共和国斯大林省出版局首次出版的Ｂ·坡坡娃著“钢铁与矿渣”和Ｎ·勃克良赤著“蓝芙蓉”两书。
    应使地方出版机关的成就巩固和扩大起来。苏维埃人民的文化要求是与日俱增的，必须大大增加一切知识部门的书籍出版数量，并更进一步地提高它的质量。党组织应当经常领导出版机关工作，深入地研究事业的每一个项目，从与作家订立合同起，直到在广大苏维埃读者群众中进行宣传与发行工作为止。各共和国、边区与省出版机关的基本任务，在吸引地方的作者以地方生活的题材来出版具有高度思想性的、内容丰富的书籍。出版机关在这一方面的工作还有着许多缺点。出版机关对于那些把共和国、边区、省的工业和农业前进生产者的经验综合起来的群众性通俗书籍，出版得很少，对于国民经济各部门中现有技术成就以及科学与生产的创造性合作的普及工作，做得也不够好。时常在那些介绍农业前进生产者的书籍里，仅仅叙述获得了那一些重大成就，但并未说明这些成就是怎样获得的。
    许多出版机关乐意翻印莫斯科出版的文艺书籍，对地方作家的组织工作却是很脆弱的。他们往往将已发表在文艺杂志上和收在文集中的创作，依样葫芦地拿来翻印一道，没有作必要的修正。有的出版了许多狭隘的本位性的和不迫切需要的书刊；这是不对的。地方出版机关出版的书籍常有文字费解的地方，形式也很坏。
    党组织应当帮助出版机关清除这一切缺点。党的各省委和区委应认真领导出版机关的工作。譬如，联共（布）中央沿海区委局在去年对出版机关的领导工作中，只批准了编辑计划。又譬如，莫尔达维亚共产党（布）中央局于一九四九年在讨论个别出版问题时，对出版机关工作并未通过一件包括出版书籍的批评和决定进一步领导出版工作的广泛决议。可是，党委不仅应当研究出版工作的个别问题，更要缜密地分析出版机关的整个工作。
    事实证明：出版机关的工作没有党的经常领导，出版物的思想的、科学的和艺术水平就很低。联共（布）北沃舍梯省委，在对本省思想工作的领导，特别是在对地方出版机关的领导上，犯了严重错误，这个例子给与我们作一个教训。以北沃舍梯国立出版局局长扎齐也夫和共和国作家协会主席马穆苏洛夫为首的一群人，因为省委对出版事业毫不过问，就垄断了共和国刊物的出版，阻碍了青年作家走入出版界的大门。为什么北沃舍梯省委看不到出版工作中的严重缺点呢？原因是：省委某一些工作者本身就是不熟练的编辑者，同时他们就是供给没有多大价值的稿子的人。北沃舍梯省委虽然担负监督共和国的出版事业的责任，他们却把出版事业中的缺点掩饰起来。
    党机关应当认真注意出版工作的设计问题。出版工作是否成功，主要是以每一年度的编辑计划拟订得是否正确为转移的。苏维埃出版业是不能任其自流的：它必须组织那些在内容上符合读者要求的书籍的出版与准备工作。为了正确地拟定编辑计划，必须经常去研究这些要求，综合图书批评，并熟悉共和国、边区、省的党政工作和经济建设的迫切任务。只有照顾到这一切以后，出版机关才能正确地拟定编辑计划。可是，有许多出版机关，只是用闭门造车的方式来拟定计划，时常把偶然收到的稿子和由作家自己拟定的题材，机械地列了进去。
    最近数年以来，地方出版机关编辑计划拟定得好一些了：它们已接近于实际和生产。可是，一九五○年度个别出版机关的计划中，还有重大缺点。譬如，所拟定的政治书籍题材范围很狭隘；历史性的题材过多；在计划中没有充分反映迫切的问题，特别是经济问题。综合共和国、边区、省的工业与农业优秀生产者的经验的书籍，普及科学与技术成就以及党工作经验的书籍等的计划出版数量是很少的。许多出版机关对于有关地方风土的书籍出版的重要性估价不够。加盟共和国与自治共和国的大多数出版机关计划中，预定译成本族语的俄罗斯古典文学作家、荣膺斯大林奖金的苏维埃作家的文艺作品数量极少。在计划中，所谓“其他”刊物的部分，数字过于庞大；而且在这一部分里，常列入许多不能畅销的书籍。拟定编辑计划时，不能不照顾工人、集体农民和知识分子群众的希望。特别是在各企业中，集体农庄和国营农场中，及知识分子间，组织作家原稿讨论会的经验已证明：讨论会的参加者对于书籍内容经常予以重要的修正，并予作家以珍贵的指示。
    某一些出版机关把还没有编好的计划送往党的省委、区委，他们马上就批准这些计划，这已成为一种形式了。自然这样一来，计划中的缺点，就无从发现并加以修正了。如果联共（布）莫尔多瓦省委，在核准一九五○年度共和国出版计划时，能认真地研究一下它的内容，那末，便可以发现这个计划的严重错误。譬如，各出版机关不知是因为什么缘故，以地方生活为题材的群众性政治书籍没有预定在今年的计划里。出版机关漠视读者对于苏维埃作家优良书籍的兴趣：预定就斯大林奖金荣膺者的文艺作品，以莫克善族语出版的书籍只有一册，以爱尔疆族语出版的书籍甚至一册也没有。在计划中，关于共和国农业的许多迫切问题并没有预定出版的刊物。虽然计划中有着这些缺点，省委局却不加修正地把它批准了。
    有一些党委在批准编辑计划以前，首先注意到预定出版书籍的内容，这种办法是正确的。党机关认真地检讨出版机关的编辑计划，可以防止不必要的书籍、甚至恶劣的书籍出版。
    在我国，对于出版事业的发展已建立了必要的条件。对于这一文化领域的领导，已集中于统一的联盟中央机关——苏联部长会议印刷出版及发行总管理局。在各地设有印刷出版及发行管理处。印刷出版及发行总管理局及其地方机构负有领导苏联全国印刷工业与出版发行的发展的责任。
    党和苏维埃政府对于地方出版机关予以莫大的帮助，供给它们纸张、装订材料，拨给必要的经费。各出版机关及印刷厂工作人员的义务是要善于应用政府的帮助。
    苏维埃书籍，在印刷形式上应具有高度品质。联共（布）中央在关于“书籍印刷形式”的议决中（一九四五年七月）责成了出版机关经理和印刷厂厂长每天要亲自来检讨印刷形式问题，缜密地研究和决定书籍的艺术装帧、开本、页边尺寸、版口、字体及字号，印刷与装订工作的品质，吸引高度熟练的造形艺术工作者来参加书籍的美术工作。
    我们的书籍的印刷与艺术形式已经大大改善了。出版机关在这方面累积了不少经验，图案画家和书籍的美术设计者人数已增加起来。最近在莫斯科由印刷出版及发行总管理局举行的书籍、图案和招贴画的展览会，证明了印刷与出版工作者，在联共（布）中央议决指示下，已经做了大规模的工作。有许多地方的出版机关，在书籍形式的质量方面，并不亚于中央的出版机关，这是值得庆幸的一件事。但是，不应安于既有的成就。为了改善书籍印刷和艺术形式，还得要下一番工夫。
    编辑委员会在提高书籍的质量方面有着重大意义。在联共（布）中央一九四六年七月通过的“关于俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国国立联合出版局工作”的议决中，已经决定了编辑委员会的任务。各编辑委员会负有审核出版机关工作计划以及检讨各出版机关所收到的各项文稿的任务。各出版机关经理，对于各项原稿应先经编辑委员会讨论后才可公布。乌克兰、阿塞尔拜疆及其他共和国许多出版机关的编辑委员会工作是有相当成绩的。
    提高出版刊物水平的最重要条件是出版工作人员的正确选择。特别要注意出版机关领导干部——经理和总编辑——的人选。直接担任书籍出版准备工作的编辑，起着主要的作用；为了完美地编辑一本书，并对作家予以帮助，编辑应有渊博的学识。可是，某一些出版机关并不认真地去选择编辑。我们在政治的、文艺的、农业的、医学的及其他书籍中，可以看到一个相同的编辑的姓名。一个没有相当修养的人怎么能够编辑书籍呢？每一个出版机关都有可能吸引个别知识部门的专家来编辑书籍。同时，编辑工作人员应每天地提高业务水平和政治水平。
    可惜，常常有一些不能使我们信任的人侵入到编辑、出版工作部门。这种现象是在党对干部的选择不予以监督的地方发生的。此种出版机关所出的书籍，总是有不少是很恶劣的，这已成为定则了。用爱沙尼亚国立出版局在其工作中犯了严重错误的事例，就可以说明这一点。
    把俄罗斯语书籍译成苏联各族人民的语言，这是国家应负责的一件事。翻译的高度质量，对于任何一种书籍——政治的、文艺的、科学技术的——都是必要的。地方出版机关对于由各种语言翻译出来的书籍，应负保证不失原书精神的重大责任。这一点，只有在认真地选择翻译与编辑干部，并由党组织经常完善地来领导出版工作的条件之下，才能达成。
    在政治、文艺和科学技术书籍的翻译工作方面，还未曾到处都达到完善的领域。某一些党组织，对于这个工作领导得不够。在许多共和国里，把翻译工作委托给未经选择的、政治水平很低的，不充分了解俄文和没有翻译经验的人们。
    在马列主义经典著作的乌兹别克译本中，发现了许多缺点。在乌兹别克斯坦，列宁和斯大林的作品：是由没有足够熟练经验的、未经选择的人来翻译的。乌兹别克斯坦共产党（布）中央虽然接到关于翻译错误和翻译干部选择失败的消息，可是并未予以注意。在检查以后判明，许多马列主义经典著作的乌兹别克语译本有严重的错误。书中所用术语并未统一。翻译人员对于那些已经成为各族语言都通用的语句，硬要译成乌兹别克语，结果把众所周知的政治术语，译成歪曲了这些术语意思的封建宗教式的词句。
    爱沙尼亚共和国文艺书籍翻译工作是由毫无学识的，未经选择的人担任的，从这个情况中，就可以了解，对于翻译工作如不予以监督，将要引起怎样的严重后果。个别书籍的译本与原本不符，歪曲作品的意思。Ａ·冈察尔著的《旗手》这篇小说的爱沙尼亚语译本中，有很多严重错误；斯塔尼斯拉夫斯基著“我的艺术生活”及其他若干书籍翻译得很坏。
    在从俄罗斯语译成苏联各族人民语言的书籍中所以有严重错误，原因全在翻译干部没有足够的修养。到现在为止，在许多地方还没有有组织地培养翻译人员的工作。高等教育部应有计划地来做这个工作。印刷出版及发行总管理局对这个工作也要负责。在各地大学语文系或师范专门学校语文系，应建立培养和提高翻译人员熟练程度的训练班网。这些训练班应备有必要的参考书籍，首先要有民族语字典。外国文和各民族语字典出版局，所出版的民族语字典为数很少，这些字典的准备工作，不应像我们在目前所看到那样的只是狭小范围内少数人的专利事业，而要由广大社会团体、学校和科学机关来共同参加这个工作。
    报纸中的批评，对出版刊物的质量有着重大影响。现代的详细书评可以帮助各地方出版机关的工作，也可以帮助读者去认识受批评的书籍。
    定期刊物中的批评是群众共产主义教育的重要手段。联共（布）中央在一九四○年通过的“论书评与图书介绍”的议决案中，责成各报馆根本上改善书评与图书介绍栏的工作，要有系统地刊载关于新书的资料。责成各共和国、边区和省的报纸经常刊载新书介绍和关于最重要的文艺作品的评论，并保证对于地方出版机关所出书籍要刊载评论。可是，在某一些地方报纸中，书评与图书介绍栏的水平很低，或是完全没有这一栏。譬如，依凡诺夫省“省区工人”报中完全没有图书介绍栏或书评栏，对省出版机关所出书籍的评论刊载得很少。在罗斯托夫省报“锤”中，很少刊载新书介绍和对地方出版机关所出书籍的评论。
    地方报纸应不断地提高书评的质量，客观地和有原则地批评每一部新书。高尔基曾说：批评应当教导我们简单地、清楚地、切实地去写文章。在报纸上完美地进行书籍的宣传，是书籍顺利推广的条件之一。不仅书籍出版，是一件重要的事，把书籍送到读者的手中，也同样是一件重要的事。所以党组织经常要注意书籍的推广。许多出版机关都关怀如何把书籍送到读者手中。可是，现在还有这样的情况：已经印好的书籍放在印刷厂、仓库、省和共和国各中心城市的书店里不往外运，而各地区、拖拉机站、集体农庄却都在等待阅读这些书籍。
    由于社会主义文化的不断高涨，并为了满足苏维埃人民有增无止的精神上的需要，就必须迅速地去发展出版事业。地方党组织和每一个党委的任务，是要经常领导出版事业，来提高我们的刊物在争取共产主义建立的新成就斗争中的作用。
