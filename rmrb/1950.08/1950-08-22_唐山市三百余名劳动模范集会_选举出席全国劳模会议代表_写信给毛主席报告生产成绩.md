[This article] reports that Tangshan City held a Labor Model Conference of the Red May Competition Movement on the 8th and 9th of this month to elect representatives to the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers, and wrote to Chairman Mao to guarantee the completion of production tasks. Three hundred and five advanced producers who achieved excellent results in the Red May production competition movement attended the conference, and three representatives were elected from among them to attend the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers. The three representatives elected are: Ge Qingxiang (worker at Kailuan Coal Mine, creator of a new coal mining record of digging seven feet of kiln and erecting three sheds in one day), Li Xiujun (worker at Tangshan Power Plant, advanced producer who created a new national coal consumption record), and Zhao Naibin (engineer at Tangshan Steel Plant, who successfully experimented with the duplex steelmaking method). After the election, the Tangshan Labor Model Conference sent a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the production achievements of Tangshan City. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    The Red May competition movement in Tangshan City concluded at the end of June. During the two-month competition, all ten major units in the city, except for individual units with special reasons, overfulfilled their production tasks. Due to workers' inventions, utilization of waste materials, and inventory of unrecorded materials, a total value equivalent to 100.5 million catties of millet was created (statistics from Huaxin Textile Factory and Kailuan Coal Mine are not included). Tangshan Railway Factory completed half a year's production tasks in five months, overhauling one locomotive, with costs reduced by 50.08% compared to the cost set by the Ministry of Railways in April. Kailuan Coal Mine, with more than 50,000 employees, increased coal production efficiency by 34% compared to before the competition, creating the highest production record in the past fourteen years. Tangshan Electric Power Bureau and Power Plant overfulfilled the electricity sales target for the first half of the year, ensured safe power transmission, broke through the bureau's set coal consumption figure, and created a new national coal consumption record of 0.577 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour for chain grate boilers. Workers at Tangshan Steel Plant successfully experimented with the duplex steelmaking method in the competition movement, creating an advanced example in the national steel industry. Twenty-two medium-sized private enterprises participating in the competition established labor-management consultation meetings, where workers worked hard to produce, open up sales channels, and overcome difficulties. This has initially changed the production outlook and work style of Tangshan City. This victory was achieved because you pointed out the direction for us, and thanks to the leadership of the Communist Party and the trade union, and the increased awareness of the working class and the broad masses of working people.
    During the competition movement, 3,400 labor models emerged in Tangshan City. More than 300 of us, along with more than 70 model units such as factories, government offices, schools, workshop groups, and work departments, were selected as labor models at the Tangshan City level. Our Labor Model Conference opened on August 8th. How excited we are! For many years, under the oppression of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang reactionaries, we lived lives worse than animals and suffered all kinds of humiliation. Today, under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party, we can live and work freely with our own wisdom and labor, and we have become models. This is an unprecedented honor.
    We know that our exemplary deeds can only be created under your wise leadership and with the unity and mutual assistance of everyone. Therefore, our glory is the glory of the working class and the working people, and it is your glory. We will never be arrogant or complacent, and we will certainly learn from the Soviet Union, learn from the masses, improve our awareness, improve our skills, improve our culture, and better do the work we should do for the country and the people, and complete the great and glorious tasks before us: we must fully support the liberation of Taiwan, repel the American aggression, and do a good job in various constructions of the new China.
    Today, as we hold the Labor Model Conference, we see our strength more clearly and have stronger confidence. Whatever tasks our country needs us to complete, we will resolutely complete them with unyielding determination.
    Chairman Mao! This is our guarantee to you.
    We wish you good health!

　　唐山市三百余名劳动模范集会
    选举出席全国劳模会议代表
    写信给毛主席报告生产成绩
    【本报讯】唐山市于本月八、九两日举行红五月竞赛运动劳动模范大会，选举出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表，并上书毛主席保证完成生产任务。出席大会的是在红五月生产竞赛运动中创造优良成绩的三百零五名先进生产者，并从其中选举三名出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。这三名代表已经选出：葛庆祥（开滦煤矿工人，创造一天作七尺窑、搭三架棚子的采煤新纪录），李秀俊（唐山发电厂工人，创造全国煤耗新纪录的先进生产者），赵乃斌（唐山钢厂工程师，曾试验双联炼钢法成功）。选举后，唐山市劳动模范大会致函毛主席，报告唐市生产成就，原函如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    唐山市红五月竞赛运动，已经在六月底结束了。在两个月的竞赛里，全市十个较大的单位，除个别单位有特殊原因外，都超额完成了生产任务。由于工人的创造发明，利用废料节约开支，清点普查账外物资，共创造价值一亿零五百万斤小米（华新纺织厂及开滦煤矿清点数字未统计在内）。唐山铁路工厂，五个月完成了半年的生产任务，大修机车一台，较四月份铁道部定的成本降低百分之五○·○八。拥有五万余职工的开滦煤矿，产煤效率较竞赛前提高百分之三十四，创造了十四年来所未有的最高生产纪录。唐山电业局及发电厂超额完成了上半年的售电任务，保证了安全送电，突破了局定的煤耗数字，创造了发电每度用煤○·五七七公斤的全国链条式锅炉煤耗的新纪录。唐山钢厂职工在竞赛运动中，试验双联炼钢法成功，在全国炼钢工业中创造了先进的范例。参加竞赛的私营企业，有二十二个中型工厂建立了劳资协商会议，职工努力生产，打开销路，克服困难。这样就初步改变了唐山市的生产面貌和工作面貌。这个胜利，是因为有您指给我们的方向，共产党和工会的领导、工人阶级和广大劳动人民的觉悟提高，才获得的。
    在竞赛运动里，唐山市涌现了三千四百名劳动模范。我们三百多人和七十多个工厂、机关、学校、车间小组、工作部门等模范单位，又被选为唐山市级的劳动模范。八月八日，我们的劳动模范大会开幕了。我们是多么兴奋啊！多少年来，在日寇和国民党反动派的压迫下，我们过着牛马不如的生活，受尽了屈辱。今天，在您和共产党的领导下，我们能用自己的智慧和劳动自由地生活，自由地劳动，我们又当了模范。这是从来未有过的光荣。
    我们知道，我们的模范事迹，只有在您的英明领导和大家的团结互助之下，才能创造出来。因此，我们的光荣就是工人阶级、劳动人民的光荣，就是您的光荣。我们绝不骄傲自满，一定在您的旗帜下，向苏联学习，向群众学习，提高觉悟，提高技术，提高文化，更好地给国家和人民作我们应该作的工作，完成摆在我们面前的伟大而光荣的任务：我们一定要全力支援解放台湾，击退美国的侵略，并且搞好新中国的各种建设。
    今天我们开劳动模范大会，更清楚地看到了自己的力量，更有了坚强的信心。我们的国家需要我们完成什么任务，我们就百折不挠地坚决去完成。
    毛主席！这就是我们向您作的保证。
    祝您健康！

      一九五○年八月九日
