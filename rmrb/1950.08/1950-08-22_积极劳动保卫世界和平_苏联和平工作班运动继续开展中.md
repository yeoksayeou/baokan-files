　　Actively Labor to Defend World Peace
    The Soviet Peace Work Team Movement Continues to Develop
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 21st] (TASS dispatch) News in brief: The Soviet working people are continuing to launch the "Peace Work Team" movement, using new labor achievements to defend world peace.
    Thousands of Stakhanovite workers in Kiev have already completed their five-year plans. Workers at the Ural Heavy Machinery Plant have unanimously decided to complete their annual plan ahead of schedule, by December 5th. Thousands of lathe operators, planing machine operators, fitters, and assemblers at the plant have exceeded their production quotas by one to two times.
    Millions of farmers in various republics have joined the peace work teams, and they are successfully harvesting grain. In the Kiev region, approximately four hundred collective farms have completed their annual grain delivery plans.
    During the Peace Work Team movement, the average catch of fish by Estonian fishermen has doubled. Fishermen and whalers in the Far East are also carrying out the Peace Work Team movement. Sidelnikov, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Republic and captain of a fishing boat, telegraphed from southern Sakhalin, reporting that the crew under his command had caught more than 370,000 poods (approximately 12,100,000 jin) of herring.

    苏联和平工作班运动继续开展中
    【新华社二十一日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联劳动人民正继续展开“和平工作班”运动，以新的劳动成绩来保卫世界和平。
    基辅的成千个斯塔哈诺夫工作者，业已完成了他们的五年计划。乌拉尔重型机器工厂的工人们，一致决定提前到十二月五日完成全年计划。该厂数千名旋工、刨床司机、装置工人和装配工人，超出了生产定额的一倍至两倍。
    各共和国已有数百万农民参加了和平工作班，他们正在顺利地收割谷物。在基辅州，约有四百个集体农场已完成了全年缴纳谷物的计划。
    在和平工作班运动期间，爱沙尼亚的渔人捕鱼平均量增加了一倍。远东区的渔人和捕鲸者也在开展和平工作班运动。俄罗斯共和国最高苏维埃代表、渔船船长西德尔尼科夫从萨哈连南部来电，报道他属下的船员已捕获鲱鱼三十七万余普特（约合一千二百一十余万市斤）。
