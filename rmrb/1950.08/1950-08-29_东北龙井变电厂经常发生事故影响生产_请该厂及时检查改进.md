　　Frequent Accidents at the Northeast Longjing Substation Affect Production
　　Please Conduct Timely Inspections and Improvements
　　To the Editors:
　　The Longjing Substation in Jilin Province frequently experiences power outages, which affect our production. Please publish this matter in the newspaper.
　　Since the state-owned Jilin Kaishantun Paper Mill began production on July 20th, under the close coordination of technicians and workers, it completed the July task four days ahead of schedule. Production has increased from 0.97 tons per hour to two tons. The machinery is also operating well. Under these circumstances, the spirit of all the employees in the factory is high, and each production workshop is competing to launch challenge campaigns. They are determined to complete the August production task of 440 tons of pulp fifteen days ahead of schedule. However, the Longjing Substation continues to experience power outages, affecting the completion of production tasks. From 7:30 on August 3rd to 14:53 on August 4th, there was no electricity, totaling thirty-one hours and twenty-three minutes of downtime. According to them, the reason for the power outage was boiler repair. However, from 18:40 on August 4th, there was another power outage of four hours and forty-eight minutes. It was said that there was a problem with the lines. From 6:25 on August 7th, there was another power outage of twenty-four hours and twenty-four minutes. This time, they called again, saying that the boiler steam pipe was leaking. On the 9th of this month, there was a power outage from 2:05 to 2:07, and on the same day at 20:28, there was another power outage that lasted until 7:00 on the 10th. The total downtime was one hundred and seventy-one hours and nine minutes.
　　The power supply from the Longjing Substation is also extremely abnormal. For example, at 3:00 PM on the 9th, the voltage dropped to 2,500, and the frequency changed from 47 to 53, seriously affecting the safe operation of high-voltage motors. After careful and cautious measures by all the workers in our factory, we maintained a safe operating state. However, at 20:07 on the evening of the 9th, the voltage suddenly dropped to over 1,000, and we immediately shut down the power automatically. As of 7:00 AM on the 10th, power had not been restored.
　　The frequent power outages at the Longjing Substation within these ten days have affected the production of more than 830 people in our factory, causing the daily production of over 48 tons of pulp to fall into a state of semi-shutdown. This situation not only affects the production tasks of our factory but also affects the production work of paper mills in Northeast China. Because the Jilin Paper Mill, Shenyang, Liaoyang, Andong and other paper mills are all supplied with raw materials by our factory. If they do not receive raw material supplies, they will have to shut down.
　　We hope that all the employees of the Longjing Substation will fully recognize the serious impact of power outages and abnormal power supply on production and quickly find ways to ensure a safe power supply in the future.

### 东北龙井变电厂经常发生事故影响生产  请该厂及时检查改进

　　东北龙井变电厂经常发生事故影响生产
    请该厂及时检查改进编辑同志：
    吉林省龙井变电厂经常发生停电事故，影响了我们的生产，请把这件事在报纸上发表。
    国营吉林开山屯造纸厂自七月二十日开始生产以来，在技术员与工友密切的联系下，曾将七月份任务提前完成四天。产品由每小时○点九七吨，提高到两吨。机械运转也很良好。在这样的情况下，全厂职工精神振奋，每个生产车间，都争先恐后地展开挑战运动。他们决心将八月份的生产任务四百四十吨纸浆提前十五天完成。但龙井变电厂却不断地发生停电事故，影响了生产任务的完成。由八月三日七时三十分钟起、到四日十四点五十三分钟止，一直没有电，共停了三十一小时二十三分。据他们说，停电原因是修理锅炉。但至八月四日十八时四十分钟起又停电四点四十八分钟。据说是路线发生毛病。八月七日六点二十五分起又停电二十四小时二十四分。这次他们又来电话，说是锅炉汽管跑汽。本月九日两点五分至两点七分停电，同日二十点二十八分钟又停电，一直停到十日七时。共计停电一百七十一小时零九分。
    龙井变电厂送电也极不正常。如九日下午三时，电压降到两千五百，周波数从四十七变到五十三，严重地影响了高压电动机的安全运转。经我厂全体工友小心谨慎地设法，维持安全运转状态。但至九日晚二十时七分钟，电压突然下降到一千多，我们立即自动停电。至十日七时尚未能送电。
    该厂在这十天内的经常停电，影响了我厂八百三十余人的生产，使日产四十八吨有余的纸浆生产，陷于半停工的状态。这种情况，不仅影响本厂的生产任务，而且影响了东北各纸厂的生产工作。因为吉林纸厂、沈阳、辽阳、安东等各纸厂，都由本厂供给他们原料，要是他们得不到原料供应，就只有停工。
    我们希望龙井变电厂全体职工充分认识停电及送电不正常现象对生产所发生的严重影响，迅速设法保证今后安全送电。
