　　Learn from the Fushun Mine Train Collision
    The train collision at the Xintun Mine in Fushun Coal Mine on August 7th was a major accident in state-owned coal mines this year, second only to the gas explosion at the Yiluo Coal Mine.

    In the first half of this year, Fushun Coal Mine had multiple major casualty incidents, resulting in the deaths of 40 miners and injuries to over 1,900. During this period, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government repeatedly emphasized safe production and implemented comprehensive safety education; the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government also conducted a major safety inspection. However, the responsible personnel of the mine failed to give thorough consideration on how to comprehensively prevent accidents and failed to take necessary measures, resulting in the unfortunate train collision.

    Although the direct cause of the train collision was due to the driver's lack of experience and improper operation, the fundamental reason was the mine's leadership's lack of concern for miners' safety and their neglect of technical management. Comrade Stalin clearly taught us twenty years ago (1931) in his article "The Tasks of Business Executives" regarding the importance of science and technology in industrial construction: in the era of economic transformation, technology decides everything. However, the leaders of Fushun Coal Mine simply and one-sidedly used "pure political stance" as a reason to appoint Li Hongchen, who had only been trained for three months in the transportation office, as a tram driver! This kind of disregard for technology, recklessly entrusting such a job requiring skilled technical operation to an ordinary worker who had only "studied for three months," and this serious bureaucratic style of ignoring production safety and the safety of the lives of the masses, should be thoroughly examined and corrected in the rectification movement, and the persons responsible for the accident should be given due punishment. More importantly, in future work, we must earnestly carry out comprehensive safety work and strive to prevent similar avoidable accidents.

### 接受抚顺矿撞车事件的教训

　　接受抚顺矿撞车事件的教训
    八月七日抚顺煤矿新屯撞车事件，是今年国营煤矿中仅次于宜洛煤矿瓦斯爆炸的重大事故。
    抚顺煤矿在今年上半年，曾发生重大伤亡事件多起，共死亡矿工四十人，负伤一千九百余人。在此期间，中央人民政府燃料工业部虽一再强调安全生产，实施全面的保安教育；东北人民政府工业部并已进行保安大检查；但该矿负责人员对于如何全面防止事故，仍未加以周详的考虑，仍未采取必要的措施，以致发生此次撞车的不幸事件。
    此次撞车事件的发生，虽然直接原因是由于司机缺少经验，操纵不当所致；但基本原因是该矿领导人员，不关心矿工安全，忽视技术管理所造成的恶果。关于科学技术在工业建设中的重要性，二十年前（一九三一年）斯大林同志在《论经济工作人员的任务》一文中，已经明确地教导了我们：在经济改造时期，技术决定一切。但是，抚顺煤矿领导人，竟然单纯地、片面地以“政治立场纯洁”为理由，任命仅在运输事务所训练三个月的李鸿臣为电车司机！此种轻视技术，轻率的将如此需要熟练技术操作的业务委托给仅仅“学习三个月”的普通工人。这种忽视生产安全，忽视群众生命安全的严重官僚主义作风，应该在整风运动中进行彻底的检查与纠正，并给予事故责任者以应得的处分。更重要的，是在今后工作上，要切实进行全面的保安工作，努力争取不再发生类此可以避免的责任事故。
