Fascism in the United States

At the beginning of this year, American reactionaries, on the basis of "fighting communism," took measures to consolidate their forces. The Ku Klux Klan, a stronghold of obscurantism and religious fanaticism, has intensified its murderous activities.

This gang held its founding convention in Jacksonville, Florida, last winter. At this conference, the emperor of the "Invisible Empire" was elected. At the same time, a two-day meeting of the "American Legion" and other fascist organizations was held in New York. "Meritorious" provocateurs led the meeting: former US Ambassador to Moscow, Walter Bedell Smith, Congressman Mundt (who led the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee), Woll (one of the leaders of the American Federation of Labor) and his partners in betraying the interests of the working masses, Carey of the CIO. Directing the meeting were representatives of the National Association of Manufacturers, figures trusted by monopoly capital.

Carey's speech was the most brazen. He said: "In the last war, we united with the Communists to fight the fascists, and in the new war, we will unite with the fascists to defeat the Communists." Mundt put forward extremely "practical" proposals. He demanded the establishment of special "commando teams" everywhere – in enterprises, in government agencies, in universities and ordinary schools – to stalk progressive workers, staff, and students. The gatherings in Jacksonville and New York were preludes to the establishment of a fascist party in the United States.

The Ku Klux Klan is one of the oldest terrorist organizations in the United States. It emerged as early as 1865-1866, when the first group of this secret knighthood began its activities in Tennessee. It was tasked with using terror to suppress the progressive movement in the country. The Ku Klux Klan was the first militant organization of American capitalists to conceal its reactionary essence under the guise of "patriotism." Holding "reviews" and other public ceremonies is a favorite method of fascist obscurantists. The real purpose of all these ridiculous parades, day and night, is to intimidate the working masses. Naturally, such measures always receive the full support of the authorities. Usually, parades are organized at such times when, as reactionary newspapers say, "social tranquility in the country is being disrupted or there are prerequisites for such disruption."

It goes without saying that the Ku Klux Klan enjoys the special favor of capitalists, who widely subsidize the organization. In terms of its nature of activity, it is a militarized organization. Its armed forces are even equipped with machine guns and tear gas grenades. In order to quickly transport bandits to their destinations, a huge fleet of vehicles and its own communication network have been established.

In light of these facts, the attitude of the reactionary leaders of American trade unions is of great benefit to the Ku Klux Klan. The resolution passed by the American Federation of Labor convention in Cincinnati is a clear document showing this relationship. The resolution states: "The AFL cannot and will not condemn any organization, association, or group of American citizens as long as such organization does not intend to interfere with the rights, opportunities, and freedom of employed labor."

One can imagine that the reactionaries and their servants sometimes openly admit that they are pursuing such goals!

The Ku Klux Klan members also disguise their true intentions, and at favorable times, they also pretend to be friends of the workers. The reactionary upper echelons of American trade unions – loyal lackeys of the capitalists – are essentially secret allies of the Ku Klux Klan.

The New York "Daily Worker," in depicting the struggle of the murderers against the labor movement, wrote: "The 'Ku Klux Klan' members, under the guise of masks and the cover of darkness, like all criminals, attempt to suppress workers through terror and force them to submit to capitalist slavery: racial prejudice, religious hostility, nationalistic hatred – all of these have been turned into capital by the Ku Klux Klan swindlers... Therefore, it is conceivable that nothing is more hateful and terrible to the Ku Klux Klan members than the word 'communism' itself. Because they see the end of their rule in the class consciousness and organization of the workers."

During the Roosevelt era, a law was passed banning the Ku Klux Klan, but the reactionaries did everything possible to undermine its implementation. The knighthood went underground, and in some states, with the help of local authorities, it disguised its organization as an "educational and cultural" group. During World War II, the knighthood stipulated its task as doing everything possible to assist German fascists by carrying out sabotage within the country.

The knighthood members and the Nazis established close cooperation through the "German-American Bund." The actual connection between the two was solemnly fixed on August 18, 1940, at the Nordland Nazi camp (New Jersey). On this occasion, a review of Ku Klux Klan members and "German-American Bund" members was held.

This new alliance soon formulated a joint action program to sabotage the worker's movement and Roosevelt's war plan.

Since the Japanese attacked the US naval base at Pearl Harbor, the American fifth column has concentrated its activities on disrupting the government's military measures. They used every means to reduce production speed and military production.

Since Roosevelt's death, the knighthood has boldly emerged from "underground," although the law banning the Ku Klux Klan has not yet been repealed. As early as the beginning of 1946, American newspapers had cited the fact that obscurantists openly resumed activities wearing white hooded clothes. The organization was first officially registered in Georgia. In Florida, the Ku Klux Klan organization had been active since April 1944. In the summer of the same year, the leaders of the Georgia organization declared to the press representatives that there were more than 20,000 knighthood members in the state.

With the resumption of open activities by these murderers came acts of terror against blacks. For example, in Freeport, a suburb of New York, police officers shot and killed three blacks – veterans of the Great War – without any reason. As the 1948 election drew closer, the terror against blacks intensified.

The Ku Klux Klan tried every means to prevent blacks from supporting the Progressive Party. To this end, knighthood members sent threatening letters to many black leaders. In response to the Progressive Party's solemn declaration of fighting against the persecution of blacks, knighthood leader Green declared: "The Ku Klux Klan will never allow whites and blacks to be equal under any circumstances." Stoner, the leader of the Tennessee organization, went further in a statement to Congress, demanding that blacks be officially recognized as "sons of the devil."

The New York correspondent of the British "News Chronicle" recently described the "achievements" of racist bandits: "At present, the Ku Klux Klan has expanded its activities and organized terrorist branch organizations in the western and midwestern states, and not only the blacks it lynches are suffering, but also white trade union organizers." At present, the Ku Klux Klan is doing everything possible to expand the number of its members. It has also established children's organizations to cultivate bandit habits from childhood and educate children in the spirit of hatred for humanity.

Speaking of the Ku Klux Klan, one has to talk about the methods of abuse they use. The so-called "black paint body team" ("black oil and feather picnic") and lynching are still their favorite methods. After determining the object of abuse, knighthood members attack this person openly during the day or night, often in front of government offices, smear them with asphalt or resin, roll them in the feathers and fluff of torn feather mattresses, and then strangle them, burn them on a pyre, throw them into the river, or shoot them.

In Florida, masked and hooded fanatics abuse their victims more skillfully. They slowly scald them with the so-called "sweat box." This method of abuse was used 150 years ago in British floating prisons where convicts serving hard labor were imprisoned.

Barbaric abuse is even carried out openly in public places. In a theater in New York, the famous circus actor Graham was scheduled to perform a new program. His performance was a parody of the knighthood members' farce. Graham, wearing a funny white coat, appeared on stage with a doll dressed in the same clothes as him. After saying a few jokes, the audience burst into laughter – followed by a rain of stone bullets flying at the actor. Graham was carried out of the theater half-dead, and he had no choice but to leave New York without hesitation.

When persecuting "politically unreliable" whites, the Ku Klux Klan demands that they be expelled from the area immediately. Within 12 hours, this person must abandon their family and leave under surveillance. Abuse of whites is usually carried out in extreme secrecy. The victim disappears without a trace. An example is a newspaper editor in Memphis, Tennessee, who exposed the criminal activities of fascist murderers in his newspaper.

In order to protect its members, the Ku Klux Klan has its own police and secret agents. They also play a major role in the struggle against the labor movement. They work closely with state secret police agencies. Search training is the most important task of the knighthood. Professor Meeklin, the author of the book On the Ku Klux Klan, specifically pointed out: "Wherever the Ku Klux Klan rules, people must be careful when speaking." A former member of the party, Pastor Bugard (Little Rock), explained that everyone who participated in the gang "was immediately ordered to monitor each other forever and to keep their mouths shut." You can't say it any simpler or clearer. Every member of the organization, no matter who they are and where they work, is obligated to report everything they know to the knighthood. Therefore, the Ku Klux Klan's intelligence network is extremely broad.

Fascistization within the United States is proceeding rapidly. All kinds of murderous, reactionary, and fascist groups are springing up like mushrooms after rain. The arrogance of the Ku Klux Klan – this openly fascist terrorist organization – is a clear example of the development of fascist tendencies in the United States.

　　苏联劳动报专文
    法西斯主义在美国
    本年初，美国反动派在“和共产主义作斗争”的基础上，采取了团聚自己力量的措施。三Ｋ党骑士团——蒙昧主义和宗教狂的堡垒——加强了它的屠杀活动。
    这一匪帮团体于去冬在杰克逊维尔（佛罗里达州）举行成立大会。在这次大会上曾选举“无形帝国”的皇帝。同时又在纽约举行“美国军团”及其他法西斯组织为期两日的会议。“有功的”挑拨名手为会议首领：前美驻莫斯科大使贝杰尔·史密斯，国会议员蒙特（曾领导臭名远扬的非美活动调查委员会），伍尔（美劳联首领之一）及其出卖劳动群众利益的伙伴，产联的凯莱。导演会议的是全国制造商协会代表，即垄断资本所信任的人物。
    凯莱的演说最是肆无忌惮，他说：“上次大战时，我们联合共产党人对法西斯分子作战，而在新战争中，我们将联合法西斯分子来击溃共产党人。”蒙特提出了极“实际的”提案。他要求在企业中、在机关中、在大学和普通学校中，到处建立为对进步的工人、职员、学生进行钉梢的特种“别动队”。在杰克逊维尔和纽约这两处的集会，乃是在美国建立法西斯党的前奏曲。
    三Ｋ党是美国最老的恐怖组织之一。早在一八六五——一八六六年便已产生，那时，这种秘密骑士团的第一个小组便在田纳西州开始了活动。它负有用恐怖手段阻止国内进步运动的使命。三Ｋ党是美国资本家第一个用“爱国主义”的幌子掩盖其反动本质的好斗的组织。举行“检阅”以及其他公共仪式，是法西斯蒙昧主义者最爱用的方法。所有这一切黑天白日的滑稽的游行，其真正的目的是要威吓劳动群众。自然，这种措施总是得到当局完全支持的。通常是在这样的时机，如反动报纸所说，即当国内“社会安宁遭受破坏或发生这种破坏的前提”时来组织游行。
    不言而喻，三Ｋ党享有资本家的特别恩惠，资本家广泛地津贴这个组织。按活动的性质来说，它是军事化的组织。它的武装队伍甚至装备有机关枪和催泪瓦斯弹。为了能将匪徒迅速送到目的地，建立了庞大的汽车队和自己的通讯联络。
    照这些事实看来，美国工会反动领袖的态度对于三Ｋ党有很大的好处。在辛辛那提举行的美国劳联代表大会所通过的决议，乃是表明这种关系的显明的文件。决议说：“劳联不能不支持而且不愿非难美国公民的任何组织、会社或团体，只要这种组织无意妨害雇佣劳动的权利、机会和自由”。
    可以想想看，反动派及其仆从们有时竟公然承认他们在追求这样的目的！
    三Ｋ党分子也把自己的真正企图伪装起来，而在有利时也装作工人的朋友。美国工会反动的上层分子——资本家的忠实走狗——实质上是三Ｋ党的秘密盟友。
    纽约“工人日报”在刻画屠杀者反对工人运动的斗争时写道：‘三Ｋ党’分子在假面具的伪装下，在黑暗的掩护下，也同一切罪犯一样，企图借助于恐怖来压制工人，使他们顺从资本家的奴役：种族的偏见，宗教的敌对，民族主义的仇恨——凡此一切都被三Ｋ党骗子变成了本钱……因而可以想见，在三Ｋ党分子看来，再没有什么比“共产主义”一语本身更可恨和可怕的了。因为他们从工人的阶级自觉和工人的组织上看到自己统治的末日”。
    在罗斯福时代，曾经通过关于禁止三Ｋ党的法律，可是反动派曾费尽一切力量来破坏它的实施。骑士团潜入地下，而在若干州则得到地方当局的援助而把自己的组织涂改为“文教”团体。在第二次世界大战时，骑士团规定自己的任务是以在国内进行破坏工作来尽力协助德国法西斯分子。
    骑士团分子与纳粹分子透过“德美同盟”建立了密切合作。两者之间的实际连系于一九四○年八月十八日在诺尔德林德纳粹营（新泽西州）郑重地固定起来。就在这个场合举行了三Ｋ党人和“德美同盟”盟员的检阅。
    这个新同盟不久就制定了共同破坏工人运动和罗斯福作战计划的行动纲领。
    自日本袭击美海军基地珍珠港以后，美第五纵队便集中其活动破坏政府的军事措施。他们利用一切手段以降低生产速度和减少军用生产。
    自罗斯福逝世后，骑士团便大胆地从“地下”走出，虽然，关于禁止三Ｋ党的法律直到现在还没有被废止。早在一九四六年初，美国报纸已引举公然恢复穿白色蒙面衣服的蒙昧主义者活动的事实。该组织首先在佐治亚州正式登记。在佛罗里达州，三Ｋ党组织自一九四四年四月起就已开始活动。在同年夏，佐治亚州组织领导人向报界代表宣称，在该州的骑士团团员计有两万人以上。
    随着这些屠杀者恢复公开活动而来的，是反黑人的恐怖行动。例如，在纽约郊外的佛里波尔特，警官无任何理由便枪杀了三个黑人——大战的退伍军人。当一九四八年的大选日益接近的时候，反黑人的恐怖就愈来愈加紧。
    三Ｋ党千方百计地极力阻挠黑人支持进步党。为此目的，骑士团员曾向许多黑人首领发出恐吓信。骑士团领导人葛林在回答进步党为反对迫害黑人而斗争的庄严宣言时宣称：“三Ｋ党不论在任何情况下永不容许白人和黑人平等”。田纳西州组织的首领斯托涅尔在致国会的声明中，更进一步要求正式承认黑人是“魔鬼的儿子”。
    英国“新闻纪事报”驻纽约记者不久以前在描述种族主义者强盗的“成绩”时写道：“目前三Ｋ党已扩大了自己的活动，在西部及中西部各州组织了恐怖分支机关，遭殃的不仅是它所加以私刑的黑人，而且也有白人工会组织者”。在现时，三Ｋ党千方百计地力图扩充自己成员的人数。它也建立了儿童组织，以便从幼年就培养匪帮习惯，以憎恨人类的精神教育儿童。
    谈到三Ｋ党时，不得不说一说他们所采用的虐害方法。所谓“黑油漆身队”（“黑油和羽毛的野餐”）和私刑，仍为他们所最爱好的方法。在确定虐害对象后，骑士团员便在日间或夜间往往在官厅面前明目张胆地袭击这个人，涂以柏油或树胶，把他放在拆开的羽毛褥子的羽毛和毛绒里滚，然后予以绞杀或放在柴堆里烧，投入河里或射杀。
    在佛罗里达，戴面具和穿蒙面衣的狂徒凌虐牺牲者则更为巧妙。他们用所谓“发汗箱”慢慢地烫。这种凌虐方法是一百五十年前监禁服苦役犯的英国水上监狱中所施用的。
    野蛮的虐害甚至在公共场所公然行之。在纽约一家戏院，著名的马戏团演员葛莱海姆应有一个新的节目演出。他的演出是模仿骑士团员的滑稽戏。葛莱海姆穿着滑稽的白衣，拿一个和他穿一样衣服的洋娃娃，出现在舞台上。说了几句俏皮话，观众不约而同地发出了一阵哄笑——接着就是雨一般的石弹向演员飞去。葛莱海姆抬出戏院已奄奄一息，他只得毫不迟疑地离开纽约。
    三Ｋ党在迫害“政治上靠不住的”白人时，要求把他们立刻驱逐出该地。在一二小时以内，这个人就须抛弃家室在监视下出走。虐害白人通常是极端秘密地进行的。牺牲者就这样无影无踪地消失了。如曼菲斯城（田纳西州）有一个报纸编辑，在该报上揭露了法西斯屠杀者的罪恶活动，他的遭遇就是例子。
    为了保护其成员，三Ｋ党设有自己的警察和特务。他们在反对工人运动的斗争中也起着重大作用。他们和国家秘密警察机关密切合作而行动。搜索训练乃是骑士团的最重要任务。论三Ｋ党一书的作者米克林教授特别指出：“凡三Ｋ党统治的地方，人们说话就都要小心翼翼。”前为该党一员的牧师布加尔德（小石城人）说明，每个参加匪帮的人“当即被命令永远互相监视，而且要守口如瓶”。你再不能说得更简单和明了了。该组织的每个成员，不论他是谁以及在什么地方工作，都有义务向骑士团报告他所知道的一切。因此，三Ｋ党的情报网是极宽广的。
    美国国内的法西斯化在迅速地进行着。各种各样杀人、反动、法西斯的团体，雨后春笋一般地生长着。三Ｋ党——这公开的法西斯恐怖组织——的嚣张，乃是美国法西斯倾向发展的显明例证。（原文载七月十一日苏联劳动报）
