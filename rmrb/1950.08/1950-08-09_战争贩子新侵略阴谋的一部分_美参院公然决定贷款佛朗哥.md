Part of the War Mongers' New Scheme of Aggression
US Senate Openly Decides to Loan to Franco

[Xinhua News Agency, August 8th] As part of a conspiracy to prepare for new aggression, the United States is arming the fascist Franco regime in Spain. According to Washington sources: The United States Senate passed a bill on August 1st, deciding to immediately grant a credit loan of 100 million U.S. dollars to Franco's Spain, thereby including Franco's Spain in the so-called "Marshall Plan." American warmongers do not deny that this loan, allocated under the guise of the so-called "European Economic Recovery Program," is actually intended to completely turn Spain into an American military base. According to Agence France-Presse: The reason for the Senate vote was "Spain's strategic importance and the Franco government's firm anti-communist stance." According to United Press, citing a powerful senator: "The result of the loan will strengthen Spain's defenses and improve its airports and transportation system." Some senators, represented by Bridges, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, further clamored to put Spain "immediately into the military aid plan." Bridges openly declared: "The United States may draft an agreement with Franco to use Spanish air bases when planning European defense (referring to aggression)."

An observer of the Soviet Red Star newspaper commented on August 5th on this new action of the US aggression plan, pointing out that the United States' arming of Franco has long been no secret. In the United States Congress and in the reactionary newspapers, calls for establishing diplomatic relations with the Franco government and allowing Franco's Spain to participate in the North Atlantic Group have become more and more frequent. Since the United States began to interfere in Korea, it has intensified its activities in Spain. U.S. officials recently made an "inspection trip" to the French and Spanish border, and two weeks later, Franco mobilized troops and built new fortresses in the Pyrenees. Now, the United States is trying to get Franco to join the United Nations. However, this conspiracy cannot deceive anyone. People all over the world condemn Franco as the executioner who slaughtered the Spanish working people and the bloody puppet of American imperialism.

　　战争贩子新侵略阴谋的一部分
    美参院公然决定贷款佛朗哥
    【新华社八日讯】作为准备新侵略的阴谋活动的一部分，美国正在武装西班牙佛朗哥法西斯政权。据华盛顿消息：美国参议院已于八月一日通过一项法案，决定立即以一亿美元的信用贷款给予佛朗哥西班牙，从而把佛朗哥西班牙包括在所谓“马歇尔计划”以内。美国战争贩子们并不否认这种在所谓“欧洲经济复兴计划”幌子下拨出的贷款，实际上是要把西班牙完全变成美国的军事基地。据法新社消息：参院投票的理由是“西班牙在战略上的重要性和佛朗哥政府坚决反共的态度”。又据合众社引某有势力的参议员的谈话称：“贷款的结果将使西班牙的防务加强，并改进其机场与运输系统。”参院一部分议员，以拨款委员会主席勃里奇为代表，更进一步叫嚣把西班牙“立即列入军事援助计划之内”。勃里奇公然宣称：“美国在计划欧洲防务（按指侵略）时，可能与佛朗哥拟订一个使用西班牙空军基地的协定。”
    苏联红星报观察家八月五日在评论美国侵略计划的这一新行动时指出，美国之武装佛朗哥，很久以来就已经不是秘密了。在美国国会中，在反动报纸上，要求与佛朗哥政府建立外交关系并容许佛朗哥西班牙参加北大西洋集团的呼声，已经越来越频繁了。自从美国开始干涉朝鲜以来，它更加加紧了在西班牙的活动。美国官员最近曾在法国和西班牙边境作过“考察旅行”，而在两星期以后，佛朗哥便在比利牛斯山区调动军队，建立新的堡垒。现在，美国正企图使佛朗哥加入联合国。但是，这种阴谋骗不了任何人，全世界人民都斥责佛朗哥，认为他是残杀西班牙劳动人民的刽子手和美帝国主义者的血腥傀儡。
