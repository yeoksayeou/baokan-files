Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 13th. The Chongqing Municipal People's Committee Against US Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea has issued a letter of protest against the US indiscriminate bombing of Korea. The protest letter stated: "Having suffered repeated defeats from the just resistance of the heroic Korean people and the People's Army, the US aggressors are using the air force to indiscriminately bomb and repeatedly strafe cities, residential areas, schools, hospitals and vast rural areas in Korea that have no military targets or defenses, and are massacring Korean civilians on a large scale. Even patients lying in hospitals and innocent children are suffering the bloody massacre of the US aggressors. This insane behavior of US imperialism, which violates international law and humanitarian norms, not only shows that the US aggressors have lost their humanity, but also shows how weak and incompetent they are in the face of the strength of the Korean people. The towering crimes of US imperialism are absolutely intolerable to all peace-loving people in the world. We, the people of Chongqing, express our firm protest against the brutal massacre of US imperialism in Korea, and at the same time, we have decided to expand and deepen the anti-imperialist aggression movement to support the just patriotic struggle of the Korean people. We fully support the statement of the Chinese People's Committee Against US Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea, and demand that the United Nations Security Council take swift action to stop the crimes of the US interventionists in Korea."

　　重庆各界人民抗议美国滥炸朝鲜
    决扩大反侵略运动支持朝鲜人民
    要求安理会迅即制止美国的罪行
    【新华社重庆十三日电】重庆市各界人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会顷发出对美国滥炸朝鲜暴行抗议书。抗议书称：“遭受了英勇的朝鲜人民和人民军的正义反击而一败再败的美国侵略者，使用空军在朝鲜对毫无军事目标和防备的城市住宅、学校、医院和广漠的农村滥施轰炸和反复扫射，大规模地屠杀朝鲜和平居民，甚至连躺在医院里的病人与天真烂漫的小孩都遭受着美国侵略者血腥的惨杀。美帝国主义这种违反国际法与人道常规的疯狂行为，不仅表示美国侵略者已经丧失人性，而且也表示着他在朝鲜人民力量面前是如何的懦弱无能。美帝的这种滔天罪行，是世界上一切爱好和平的人民所绝对不能容忍的。我们重庆市的人民对美帝国主义在朝鲜的残暴屠杀行为表示坚决抗议，同时决定以扩大并加深反帝侵略运动来支持朝鲜人民的正义的爱国斗争。我们完全拥护中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会的声明，要求联合国安全理事会迅速采取行动，制止美国干涉者在朝鲜的罪行。”
