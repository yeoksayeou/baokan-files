Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 20th: The Hubei Daye private Yuanhua Coal Mine Company suffers from corrupt management and wasted funds, causing serious difficulties in production. Although the company received 5.8 billion yuan in loans and product purchases from the People's Government within a year after liberation, and thanks to the active production of workers, the monthly output increased from 500-600 tons to 12,000 tons, the company failed to take advantage of these favorable conditions due to corruption in management, preventing normal production development and leading to sluggish sales due to high costs.

The company's organization is bloated and the system is chaotic. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the company's peak monthly output was 35,000 tons, with only 80 employees; now, with a monthly output of 12,000 tons, it employs as many as 140 employees. In addition to having odd-job workers for every kind of work, there are as many as 58 service personnel. The seven employees in the Hankou office have six odd-job workers. The monthly expenses of this office exceed 50 million yuan. The company's cost calculation is extremely chaotic, sometimes adding the company's actual expenses, and sometimes using the customary methods before the War of Resistance Against Japan, pricing each ton of coal at one dan and five dou of rice, and including all the mine restoration projects and the construction of roads and wharves without distinction within the cost. In March of this year, the company's income account included 320 million yuan from the China South Trading Company's coal purchase, but there was no expenditure account, and it is unknown where it was spent. The company has more than 40 houses for rent, but there is no record of this income in the books. In addition, in order to simply pursue profits, the company restored the poorly equipped Bao'an Mine in August of last year. After mining less than 10,000 tons, it was completely flooded in February of this year due to poor equipment. This caused a loss of funds and also left three or four hundred unemployed workers destitute without receiving severance pay. Due to the above-mentioned corruption in management, the company's funds are wasted greatly. Most of the 5.8 billion yuan in loans from the government was not used for production, and engineering investments relied on additional borrowing. In the past six months, the company has been in debt for more than 7.8 billion yuan. Due to the above reasons, the company's coal costs are particularly high, and no one buys it. For example, the cost of coal transported from Fengfeng in North China to Daye is only 280,000 yuan per ton, while the company's coal transported to the sales area costs 400,000 yuan per ton. Under the sluggish sales situation, although the company's workers are actively producing, they have not yet received their wages for June and July, and have not even received part of their unpaid wages for March and April.

The local People's Government, in order to develop production and take care of the workers' lives, is now assisting and urging the company's owners to improve management and reduce costs, and has achieved some results.

### 湖北大冶私营源华煤矿公司  机构臃肿经营腐败  成本过高销路呆滞

　　湖北大冶私营源华煤矿公司
    机构臃肿经营腐败
    成本过高销路呆滞
    【新华社汉口二十日电】湖北大冶私营源华煤矿公司经营腐败，资金浪费，在生产中造成严重困难。该公司在解放后一年中虽曾先后得到人民政府的五十八亿元贷款和收购产品等扶助，并由于工人积极生产，月产量由五、六百吨增至一万二千吨。但该公司由于经营方面的腐败，未能利用上述有利条件，使生产得到正常发展，反因成本高而销路呆滞。
    该公司机构臃肿庞大，制度混乱。该公司在抗日战争以前月产量三万五千吨的极盛时期，仅用八十个职员；而现在月产一万二千吨，竟用一百四十个职员，除在各种工作上都有杂工外，单勤务人员就有五十八人之多。在汉口办事处的七个职员，就有六个勤杂人员。这个办事处每月开支达五千万元以上。该公司计算成本异常紊乱，有时加上该公司实际开支，有时又沿用抗日战争以前的习惯办法，每吨煤按一担五斗米作价，并连矿井修复工程和修筑马路、码头等费用，也不加分别地全部算入成本以内。今年三月份，该公司收入账目内有中南贸易公司买煤款三亿二千万元，但是却没有支出账，不知用到何处。该公司有四十多栋房子出租，但帐簿上却没有这笔收入。此外，该公司为了单纯地追逐利润，在去年八月恢复了设备极差的保安矿，采矿还不到一万吨，今年二月就因设备差而全部淹没。这就使资金遭受损失，而且又未给三、四百失业工人发遣散费而使之流离失所。该公司由于上述经营上的腐败，资金浪费很大，政府贷给的五十八亿元贷款，大部未用于生产，而工程投资又靠另行借债。半年来该公司已负债七十八亿以上。由于以上原因，该公司煤的成本特别高，无人购买。如华北峰峰煤运到大冶，仅合二十八万元一吨，而该公司的煤运到销地，每吨则合四十万元。在滞销局面之下，该公司工人虽积极生产，但到现在还没有领到六、七两月的工资，甚至三、四月的部分欠资也没有领到。
    当地人民政府为了发展生产和照顾工人生活，现正协助和督促该公司资方改善经营，减低成本，已有若干成效。
