American Bandits in Korea
    Kornilov

    Just a few days ago, this was a quiet little house, embraced by a garden of greenery. Writers, poets, and painters would often come here. Many lively debates took place around the round table (in the Oriental style, the table was placed on a yellow straw mat). Each issue of the young "New Korea" magazine emerged from these debates. The owner of this comfortable little house, tall with dark eyes, listened intently to the conversations of his guests, making notes in his notebook from time to time.

    But today, we silently removed our hats in front of the large, black, circular bomb crater that had destroyed this comfortable little house. We will never again see the cheerful, smiling eyes of the talented editor of "New Korea" magazine, Wu Renmo, the owner of this little house, nor will we shake his strong hand again. An American bomb weighing a ton was dropped here, killing Wu Renmo's wife and his three children. Next to his house, American bombs destroyed many equally quiet and peaceful little houses on Lianhuali Street, where workers and staff lived.

    Since July 23rd, American air bandits have been barbarically bombing Pyongyang every day. On July 23rd (Sunday), gray clouds shrouded the city. From ten o'clock in the morning to three o'clock in the afternoon, American bombs pierced through the cold clouds, flying over the city. Thirty "Flying Fortresses" circled over Pyongyang almost all day on the 23rd, flying away for a while and then circling back again at an altitude of three thousand meters.

    We saw the grim faces of the Pyongyang people digging out the children, mothers, and old people buried under the ruins. There were no tears in their eyes, only burning anger towards the American fascist bandits. These American fascist bandits shamelessly invaded a peaceful country, causing the Korean people to bleed.

    The American executioners have repeatedly suffered defeats on the front lines. They retaliate by massacring peaceful residents. For example, the Japanese radio station has broadcast several times that it will use American resources to "unceasingly bomb Pyongyang." Pyongyang is a small city, and it is not difficult to destroy it with "Flying Fortresses." Inside Pyongyang, there are many low, one-story Oriental tile-roofed houses, but it has not surrendered. It bravely resists and fights.

    Until now, there were no air-raid shelters in Pyongyang. The reason why air-raid shelters were not dug was because the peaceful people of North Korea were not prepared for war. But in the past two weeks, digging air-raid shelters has become a matter of course in the lives of Pyongyang residents. They dug from the front door, blasted the rocks, and created several communication trenches.

    Today we visited one such air-raid shelter. People all had serious faces, but they were also quiet. Mothers with children and old people sat on the mats on the floor. Several girls with sanitary bags on their shoulders walked back and forth. We saw the familiar face of An Songxi (transliteration), the female translator who accompanied the Korean women at the Asian Women's Conference.

    "I graduated from the ambulance class two days ago," she said, and then continued, "Now many girls in Pyongyang are learning nursing. This has become a necessary thing. Because there are so many injured people."

    Deafening explosions were transmitted into the air-raid shelter. The excitement of the sound wave caused unbearable pain in everyone's ears… An hour passed, then a second… A young military officer appeared at the threshold. He clapped his hands and asked everyone to listen quietly. Then he spoke hastily and solemnly, but before he could finish speaking, applause like an explosion resounded through the air-raid shelter.

    "Anti-aircraft artillery shot down a plane," a young student from Kim Il-sung University hurriedly translated to me, "a Flying Fortress."

    Just like yesterday and the day before, the sirens sounded again. But today, as soon as the plane appeared over the city, it hurriedly flew to the side, flying even higher. Because the sky was clear, without a single cloud. This kind of weather is not suitable for bandits. They are afraid of the anti-aircraft guns that have shot down many American planes. They would rather fly into the sky on rainy or cloudy days, blindly drop bombs from an altitude of four to five thousand meters, and drop tons of bombs on undefended cities.

    The bandits in American military uniforms are not only bombing Pyongyang. Every day, they fly to Nampo, Chongjin, Wonsan, Hungnam, Haeju and other peaceful, undefended cities. They clamor to help the South Korean puppet army and the South Korean "government," but they are bombing both North and South Korea equally. They bombed sanatoriums, and as a result of the air raids, less than one-third of the several thousand houses remained. As a result of blind and indiscriminate bombing on rainy days, hundreds of houses were destroyed in Jochiwon.

    They are rampant not only in the air but also on the ground. American soldiers who cannot fight the People's Army flee in all directions, burning houses and killing peaceful residents. For example, they burned down Sochnivan (transliteration), and in South Korean cities—Pyeongtaek, Gwangju, Suwon, Anseong—more than three thousand patriotic people who refused to follow the American troops were shot dead on the orders of the US military headquarters.

    Who are the Americans fighting against in Korea now? Who are their planes, tanks, and warships shelling? You must know that the South Korean "government," which started the civil war and was enthusiastically helped by Truman, Acheson, and Lie, who described these bandits as "victims of North Korean aggression," no longer exists. Representatives of the South Korean "National Assembly" have successively broadcast on the radio, denouncing their "unfortunate leader" and "friends from across the ocean." The South Korean bandit army now barely exists. But the US military is still entrenched in a very small piece of land in Korea—this small territory is only slightly larger than one of the thirteen provinces in the country.

    This is the tragedy that the American bandits are now subjecting the peaceful cities and villages of North and South Korea to all the artillery fire and all the terror.

    Today in Korea, Americans are fighting against defenseless women, old people, and children, who have become victims of blind bombing and victims of the willful acts of fleeing American soldiers and officers.

### 美国强盗在朝鲜

　　美国强盗在朝鲜
    科尔尼洛夫
    几天以前，这里本是一所安静的小屋子，有绿荫的花园环抱着。作家、诗人、画家不时到这里来。围着圆桌（照东方习惯，桌子放在黄色草席上）作过许多次热烈的辩论。年青的“新朝鲜”杂志每期都是从这些辩论中间产生出来的。这所舒适的小屋子的主人，高身材、黑眼睛，他聚精会神地倾听着客人们的谈话，时时在笔记本上作些记录。
    可是今天我们在这所舒适的小屋子的原地方，黑色的圆形的炸弹炸毁的大窟窿前面，却沉默地摘下了帽子。我们再也看不到这所小屋子的主人——有才干的“新朝鲜”杂志主编吴壬默的愉快微笑的眼睛，再也握不到他那健壮的手了。一吨重的美国炸弹投掷在这里，把吴壬默的妻子和他的三个孩子炸死了。在他的屋子旁边，美国炸弹炸毁了莲花里街上许多同样安静的和平的小屋子，其中住的都是工人和职员。
    从七月二十三日开始，美国空中强盗每天都在野蛮地轰炸平壤。七月二十三日（星期日），灰色的阴云笼罩着城市。从早晨十点钟到下午三点钟，美国的炸弹就穿过了这寒冷的阴云，飞舞在这城市上。三十架“飞行堡垒”在二十三日几乎整天盘旋在平壤的上空，一会儿飞开去，一会儿又在三千公尺的高空绕着新圈子转回来了。
    我们看到了挖掘着埋葬在废墟下的儿童、母亲和老人的那些平壤人的严峻的面孔。在他们的眼睛里没有眼泪，只燃烧着对美国法西斯强盗的愤怒。这些美国法西斯强盗们无耻地侵入了和平的国家，使朝鲜人民流血。
    美国刽子手们在前线屡吃败仗。他们以残杀和平居民作为报复手段。例如，日本广播电台几次广播过，要利用美国的资源，“不停地轰炸平壤”。平壤是一座不大的城市，用“飞行堡垒”来毁灭它是没有什么困难的。平壤城内，有许多一层高的东方瓦顶矮房子，但是它没有屈服。它勇敢地抵抗着、战斗着。
    直到现在，平壤城内是没有防空洞的。防空洞所以不挖，因为北朝鲜的和平人民没有准备打仗。但是在最近两个星期中，挖防空洞成为平壤居民生活中一件事情了。他们从大门口挖起，把岩石爆破，造成几条交通壕。
    今天我们到过这样的一个防空洞里。人们都板着脸，但也都安静。带着孩子的母亲们和老人们坐在铺地的席子上。肩上背着卫生袋的几个女孩子前后地走着。我们看到了在亚洲妇女代表会上伴随朝鲜妇女的女翻译员安松西（译音）的熟识的面孔。
    “两天前，我从救护班毕业了，”她说，接下去又说：“现在平壤有许多女孩子都学习看护。这已成为一件必要的事情了。因为有这么多受伤的人。”
    震耳欲聋的爆炸声传进了防空洞。声浪的激动使每个人的耳朵感到了难以忍受的剧痛……一个钟头过去了，第二个钟点……在门槛上出现了一位青年军官。他拍拍手叫大家静听。于是他急忙庄严说话了，但还没有来得及说完，鼓掌声就像爆炸似的响彻了防空洞。
    “高射炮打下了一架飞机，”一位金日成大学的青年学生急促地向我翻译说，“一架飞行堡垒”。
    正像昨天和前天一样，警笛又叫起来。可是今天飞机刚出现在城市上空，就急急飞到一旁去，飞得更高了。因为天空是清朗的，一朵云也没有。这种天气不适合于强盗们。他们害怕那种击落过不少美国飞机的高射炮。他们宁愿在雨天或阴天飞上天空，从四千——五千公尺的高空盲目地投炸弹，向没有防御的城市投下数以吨计的炸弹。
    身穿美国军服的强盗们不仅是轰炸着平壤。他们每天飞到南浦、清津、元山、兴南、海州及其他和平的不设防城市。他们叫嚣着帮助南朝鲜伪军、南朝鲜“政府”，但是对于南、北朝鲜都同样在轰炸着。他们轰炸了疗养地，那地方由于空袭的结果，几千所房子仅剩下了不到三分之一。由于在雨天盲目滥炸的结果，在鸟致院炸毁了数百所房屋。
    他们不仅在空中而且在陆地上猖獗着。不能与人民军战斗的美国兵，东奔西逃，焚烧房屋，杀戮和平居民。举些例来说，他们焚烧了索钦尼凡（译音），在南朝鲜各城市——平泽、光州、水原、安城，按照美军指挥部的命令，枪杀了拒绝跟美军走的三千多个爱国志士。
    现在美国人在朝鲜与谁作战呢？他们的飞机、坦克、军舰的炮火向谁轰击呢？要知道，曾经发动了内战，把这些强盗描写为“北朝鲜侵略的牺牲者”的杜鲁门、艾奇逊和赖伊热心帮助着的这个南朝鲜“政府”，已经不存在了。南朝鲜“国民议会”的代表们，一个个相继在电台上广播，斥责自己“不幸的领袖”和“海洋彼岸的朋友”。南朝鲜匪军现在几乎不存在了。可是美军现在还盘据在朝鲜非常少的一片土地上——这一小片领土只稍稍大于国内十三个道中的一个道。
    这就是美国强盗们现在使南北朝鲜和平城市和乡村挨受全部炮火和一切恐怖的悲剧。
    今天在朝鲜，美国人向无防御的妇女、老人和儿童们作战，这些人成了盲目轰炸的牺牲者，成了逃窜的美军兵士和军官任性胡为的牺牲者了。
