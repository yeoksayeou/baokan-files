The Shanxi Linfen Special District Office Conducts Rectification
    Inspecting Work and Summarizing Experiences
    Affirming work achievements and identifying work shortcomings.
    [This newspaper dispatch] The Linfen Special District Office in Shanxi Province, under the leadership of the Special District Study Committee, conducted a rectification study session, which began on June 20th and ended on July 31st. The main content of the rectification study was to review and summarize the work of the past six months, affirm achievements, identify shortcomings, and draw lessons learned to improve work. The district's work in the past six months has achieved certain results, mainly reflected in the following aspects: (1) In terms of agricultural production: The main policy for agricultural production in the district in 1950 was to increase grain and cotton production and to build water conservancy projects. The cotton planting task was 538,100 mu, and the actual completion was 546,900 mu, exceeding the original task by 1.6%. In terms of water conservancy, 115 new and restored canals were built, exceeding the original plan by 47, increasing the area of paddy fields by 117,063.85 mu. (2) Grain depot institutions were established, and county grain depots were established in each county. 12 million jin of grain were transferred and transported to cooperate with production and disaster relief work. (3) In terms of democratic political construction, each county convened representative conferences from all walks of life two to four times, promoted democracy, studied and deployed work, consolidated the people's democratic united front, and consolidated unity. (4) In terms of culture, education, and health: Each county universally trained primary school teachers and rectified primary school classes, so that the district's primary schools initially moved from a state of chaos to regularization. This spring, the epidemic prevention team vaccinated 89,409 people, including the masses and cadres, throughout the district, and the epidemic prevention team went to the countryside 16 times. Although the above achievements have been made, there are still many shortcomings in the work, mainly reflected in the following aspects: (1) Work is procrastinating: The Civil Affairs Section of the Special District Office received instructions from the Provincial Government in May to transfer 40 worker-peasant cadres to the Taiyuan Worker-Peasant Fast Training School for study on May 25th, but this has not yet been implemented. The inventory work began to be deployed in March and was planned to be completed by the end of May, but it was not until the end of May that the inspection began, and it has not yet been fully completed. Some cases handled by the court were not closed until after more than four months. (2) Reports from various counties are not read, and the role of reports is not understood enough, which affects the understanding of the situation below. A perfunctory attitude is taken towards the work of each county, causing the work below to develop spontaneously. The work experience of each county cannot be exchanged and promoted in a timely manner. (3) The division of labor is not clear, and the system is not sound, which makes the work aimless. For example, the Provincial Government allocated 50,000 jin of relief grain, and someone from the Civil Affairs Section received it, but no one was in charge of safekeeping it. Even the Provincial Government's official dispatch for grain allocation cannot be found now, and people shirk responsibility when investigating responsibility.
    Three main types of thinking.
    In order to thoroughly overcome the shortcomings in the work and consolidate the achievements already made, comrades in the Special District Office conducted in-depth personal ideological inspections during the rectification study. The inspection was based on conscious self-examination, coupled with mutual assistance from comrades. As a result of the inspection, it was found that the following types of thinking existed among the comrades in the Special District Office: (1) They have a stable and energetic work ethic, and are ideologically pure. There are many such cadres in the Special District Office. They are loyal and responsible to the people's cause, but due to limited abilities, they are not familiar with the new work and lack experience, so their work efficiency is poor. As long as they continue to work hard to improve, they can serve the people well. (2) They are arrogant and complacent, and are content with the status quo in their work. These comrades have narrow minds, are satisfied with a little bit of achievement, are arrogant, think that their work is better than others, and look down on the power and creativity of the masses. (3) The idea of retreating home is still prevalent in the Special District Office. They carry the burden of personal problems in their minds, and they are not at ease with their work because family problems and marriage problems cannot be solved for a while. They are concerned about personal gains and losses, and are emotional. Some people ask to work in their own county, or to be teachers and earn millet. These comrades do not have the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly, and they do not have the courage to overcome difficulties. In their minds, the interests of the individual or the family are higher than the interests of the revolution.
    After the rectification study, the comrades generally reviewed their work and personal thinking. In the rectification study, because democracy was fully promoted and strong leadership was mastered, the rectification study could be carried out actively and steadily. In the work inspection, achievements were first affirmed, and then shortcomings were inspected, so that the comrades had a comprehensive understanding of the work. However, because the rectification study was short and was carried out without separation from work, the ideological problems of some comrades have not yet been completely resolved. Some comrades even asked the leadership to solve their family problems, marriage problems, and organizational problems through the rectification study. Therefore, on the basis of the rectification study, how to continue to strengthen theoretical and policy study, carry out regular criticism and self-criticism, and at the same time, frequently understand the ideological situation of the comrades and pay attention to solving certain possible difficulties and ideological problems in a timely manner, has become an important task after the rectification study.

　　山西临汾专署进行整风
    检查工作总结经验
    肯定工作成绩，找出工作缺点。
    【本报讯】山西临汾专署在专区学委总会领导下，进行了整风学习，从六月二十日开始，于七月三十一日结束。整风学习的主要内容是检查总结最近半年来的工作，肯定成绩，找出缺点，得出经验教训，以改进工作。该区半年来的工作，获得了一定的成绩，主要表现在下列各方面：（一）农业生产方面：该区一九五○年农业生产的主要方针是增产粮棉，兴修水利。植棉任务是五十三万八千一百亩，实际完成植棉五十四万六千九百亩，超过原任务百分之一·六。在水利方面，新修与恢复水渠一百一十五条，超过原计划四十七条，增加了水田一一七○六三·八五亩。（二）建立了粮库机构，各县成立了县粮库，调运粮食一二○○万斤，配合了生产救灾工作。（三）在民主建政方面，各县均召开了各界代表会两次至四次，发扬了民主，研究与布置了工作，巩固了人民民主统一战线，巩固了团结。（四）文教卫生方面：各县普训小学教员，整顿了小学校班次，使该区小学由混乱状态初步走向正规。今春防疫队在全区给群众与干部种痘八九四○九人，防疫队先后下乡十六次。虽然获得了以上的成绩，但在工作上，仍存在着许多缺点，主要表现在下列各方面：（一）工作拖拉：专署民政科于五月份接省府指示，调工农干部四十名于五月二十五日到太原工农速成中学学习，但到现在还未执行。又清仓工作从三月份开始布置，计划在五月底完成，但直到五月底才开始检查，至今尚未全部完成。法院处理案件，有的拖到四个多月才结案。（二）不看各县报告，对报告作用认识不够，因此影响了对下面情况的了解，对各县工作采取敷衍塞责的态度，使下面工作发生自流现象。各县的工作经验，也不能及时交流推广。（三）分工不明确，制度不健全，使工作茫无头绪。如省府拨来救济粮五万斤，民政科有人接收，但没有人保管，到现在连省府的拨粮公文也找不到了，追究责任时互相推诿。
    三种主要的思想类型。
    为了彻底克服工作中的缺点，并巩固已经获得的成绩，专署同志在整风学习中进行了深入的个人思想检查。以自觉的自我检查为主，加上同志们的互相帮助进行检查。检查结果，发现专署同志中存在着下列几种思想类型：（一）工作情绪稳定，有朝气，思想上纯洁。专署这类干部不少。他们对人民事业忠诚负责，但因能力所限，对新的工作不熟悉，经验少，所以工作效率较差，只要不断努力提高，就能很好地为人民服务。（二）骄傲自满，工作上安于现状。这些同志胸襟狭隘，满足于一点微小的成绩，盛气凌人，认为自己的工作比别人好，看不起群众的力量和创造。（三）退却回家思想，在专署还是不少。他们在思想上背着个人问题的包袱，因为家庭问题，婚姻问题一时不能解决，工作不安心。计较个人得失，闹情绪。有些人要求到本县工作，或者当教员赚小米。这些同志没有全心全意为人民服务的思想，没有克服困难的勇气。在他们的心目中，个人或家庭的利益高于革命的利益。
    经过了整风学习，一般同志对工作及个人思想都作了检查。在整风学习中，因为充分的发扬了民主，而又掌握了坚强的领导，使整风学习能够积极地、稳当地进行。在工作检查中，首先肯定成绩，然后检查缺点，使同志们对工作有了全面的认识。但是因为整风学习时间短促，又是不脱离工作来进行的，部分同志的思想问题仍未得到彻底解决。甚至有些同志通过整风学习，要求领导上解决其家庭问题，婚姻问题，组织问题等。因此在整风学习的基础上，如何继续加强理论与政策学习，开展经常性的批评与自我批评，同时经常了解同志们的思想情况，及时注意解决某些可能解决的困难与思想问题，就成为整风学习以后的重要工作。
