    【新华社四日讯】中国共产党中央委员会曾于七月十四日致电日本共产党中央委员会，庆祝日共成立二十八周年纪念。据七月十七日东京“联合通信”消息：日共临时中央指导部曾于七月十五日复电致谢。电文如下：
    当我党成立二十八周年纪念日之际，接获贵党中央委员会的贺电，衷心感谢。前此，在共产党与工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”发表“关于日本的形势”的论文后，我党受到贵党通过北京人民日报的忠告，并且此次又同样地在北京人民日报社论“日本人民斗争的现势”中受到恳切的助言。对于前辈——贵党给予我党的厚意和援助，我党誓将加强党的统一，更进一步地加强伟大的中国人民和日本人民的不灭的团结，并进而与全世界爱好和平的力量团结起来，排除帝国主义势力的挑拨和暴压，为保卫亚洲和世界的持久和平与争取完成民族独立人民民主而坚决斗争。
    光荣的中国革命的领导者毛泽东同志万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中日两国人民友好团结万岁！
