　　Supplying the Needs of US Imperialism's War of Aggression
    Japanese Government Plans to Expand Steel Production
    [Xinhua News Agency Dispatch] The reactionary Yoshida government of Japan is planning to greatly increase steel production to supply the needs of its master, the United States, for its war of aggression. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th, quoting Kyodo News Agency: In view of the expected increase in demand for steel products due to the outbreak of the Korean War, the Japanese government is planning to greatly expand steel production in the next fiscal year (starting from April 1, 1951, to the end of March of the following year). The Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Economic Stabilization Board of the Yoshida government are currently studying the steel production targets for the next fiscal year. It is expected that the production target will be set at 2.8 million tons of pig iron and 3.5 million tons of steel (the original production target for this fiscal year was 1.92 million tons of pig iron and 2.5 million tons of steel) to supply the "special procurement" of the US occupation authorities. According to the Yoshida government's plan, a 600-ton blast furnace at the Kamaishi Factory of Japan Iron & Steel Co. (located in northeastern Honshu) will be restored to use this year. In addition, three other blast furnaces will be restored to use in the next fiscal year, including a 1,100-ton blast furnace at the Yawata Factory of Japan Iron & Steel Co. (located at the northern tip of Kyushu).

　　供应美帝进行侵略战争的需要
    日政府计划扩大钢铁生产
    【新华社讯】日本吉田反动政府正计划大量增加钢铁生产，以供应其主子美国进行侵略战争的需要。据路透社东京九日电引共同社消息：鉴于因朝鲜战争的发生，预料对钢铁产品的需要将增加，日本政府正计划于下一会计年度（按自一九五一年四月一日起，至次年三月底止）将钢铁生产大事扩大。吉田政府通商贸易省及经济安定本部现正在研究下一会计年度的钢铁生产目标。预料生产目标将确定为铣铁二百八十万吨，钢材三百五十万吨（本会计年度的生产目标原为铣铁一百九十二万吨、钢材二百五十万吨），以供应美国占领当局的“特殊采购”。根据吉田政府的计划，日本制铁公司釜石工厂（按在本州东北部）的一座六百吨的大熔炉将在本年内恢复使用。此外另有三座大熔炉将要在下一会计年度内恢复使用，其中包括日本制铁公司八幡工厂（按在九州北端）的一座一千一百吨的大熔炉。
