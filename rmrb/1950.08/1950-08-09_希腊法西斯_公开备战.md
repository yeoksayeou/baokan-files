　　Greek Fascists
    Openly Prepare for War

    Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, August 8th: TASS, Sofia, August 6th: The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency, citing the Free Greece Radio, reports that the Greek royalist fascists are openly preparing for war.

    According to available intelligence, the command of the royalist fascist combat troops stationed in Sapete has issued an order prohibiting people's activities near the border, otherwise they will be punished with death. The fascist newspapers are spreading absurd rumors about guerrilla activities, in order to conceal the activities of their own troops near the border. The fortifications of the "Metaxas Line" or other places near the village of Nimfea are being built, and the roads from Didyma to the border are being asphalted, and the port of Didyma is being expanded. The royalist fascists began setting fire to forests in Gumojina, Demotika and other border areas in June.

　　希腊法西斯
    公开备战
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社索非亚六日讯：保加利亚通讯社援引自由希腊电台报道：希腊保皇法西斯正在公开备战。
    根据现有情报，驻萨彼德的保皇法西斯作战部队指挥部已发布命令，禁止边界附近的人民活动，否则将处以死刑。法西斯各报正大肆传播关于游击队活动的荒诞谣言，借以隐匿他们自己的军队在边界附近的活动。在尼姆菲亚村附近的“麦塔克萨斯防线”或其他各地的防御工事，正在修筑中，自第底亚加施至边境的公路均敷上沥青，并将第底亚加施港口予以扩充。保皇法西斯在六月间已开始纵火烧毁古摩吉那、德莫蒂卡及边境其他地区的森林。
