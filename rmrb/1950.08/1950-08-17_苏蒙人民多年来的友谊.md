　　The Friendship Between the Soviet and Mongolian Peoples Over the Years
　　By: Leontiev, Soviet Union

　　The entire history of Soviet-Mongolian relations is a vivid model of the solid friendship between the two countries.

　　With the help of the Soviet Union and the great leaders of the working people of the world, Lenin and Stalin, the Mongolian people established their own people's democratic state. As early as August 1919, the Soviet Union was the first in the world to announce its recognition of the Mongolian people's right to free and independent existence. At that time, the Soviet regime declared: "Mongolia is a free country, and no foreigner has the right to interfere in Mongolia's internal affairs."

　　In October 1921, Soviet-Mongolian negotiations opened in Moscow. As a result of these negotiations, a treaty on the establishment of friendly relations between the two countries was signed.

　　This treaty stipulated that the two countries would exchange plenipotentiary representatives. The treaty showed the Soviet people's determination to help the Mongolian people's political, economic, and cultural revival and development. The Soviet government abolished the unequal treaties that the former Tsarist government had forced Mongolia to sign. All of the loans exceeding five million gold rubles that Tsarist Russia had lent to Mongolia before the revolution were also written off, with no repayment required.

　　The further development of Soviet-Mongolian relations proves that the Soviet Union's peaceful policy, based on the great Leninist-Stalinist principles of equality and friendly cooperation between large and small nations, has an unbreakable power.

　　On November 27, 1934, in the context of border provocations launched by Japanese warlords, the Soviet and Mongolian governments concluded a verbal agreement. It mentioned the common vigilance and prevention of the danger of armed aggression by foreign enemies, and mutual assistance and support if the Soviet Union or the Mongolian People's Republic was attacked by any third country. Developing from this agreement, the Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed in Ulaanbaatar in March 1936. This treaty became a reliable guarantee of the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic.

　　On May 11, 1939, when the Japanese imperialist army invaded the border of the Mongolian People's Republic at Nomonhan, the Soviet Union immediately provided armed assistance to the Mongolian People's Republic. In August of the same year, the Soviet and Mongolian armies head-on defeated the Japanese invading forces.

　　Standing on the righteous position of friendship, the Soviet people have been helping the Mongolian people in economic and cultural aspects since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic. The Soviet government has helped the Mongolian People's Republic improve its animal husbandry economy—the foundation of the national economy. The Soviet Union systematically dispatched skilled veterinary workers to Mongolia and transported machinery, medicines, and equipment for mowing machine stations to Mongolia. This played a huge role in the development of Mongolia's animal husbandry economy. All of this is a manifestation of Soviet assistance. As a result of this assistance, the number of livestock in the Mongolian Republic has almost doubled compared to 1921.

　　With the help of the Soviet Union, the Mongolian People's Republic established a national industry equipped with modern technology and built huge factories. In 25 years, the total number of factories increased 251 times, and coal mining increased 126 times. The Mongolian People's Republic has established modern postal and telecommunications institutions and built railways. Automobile transportation has also developed.

　　The Soviet Academy of Sciences and other Soviet scientific institutions regularly help the Mongolian People's Republic develop culture and science, and research and exploit Mongolia's natural resources.

　　As a result of the Soviet Union's friendly assistance in all aspects, the Mongolian People's Republic has transformed from a colonial status into an authoritative country and is steadily moving towards socialism via the non-capitalist path.

　　A new socialist economic system has emerged in the Mongolian People's Republic, that is, state and cooperative enterprises in industry, rural economy, transportation, and postal and telecommunications. This socialist economic system is continuing to develop. Restrictions on private capital in retail commodity circulation, the monopoly of foreign trade, and the establishment of a unified state bank—all these measures guarantee the prerequisites for further national development.

　　The Mongolian people accept the great neighbor's generous help with deep gratitude. In 1945, inspired by the friendship with the Soviet people, the Mongolian people were willing to contribute to the cause of safeguarding world peace and declared war on Japanese imperialism. The Mongolian army actively participated in the war in North China and eliminated the Japanese army.

　　The Soviet-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance signed in February 1946 further consolidated the friendship between the Soviet and Mongolian peoples. At the same time as the signing of the Soviet-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet-Mongolian Agreement on Economic and Cultural Cooperation was also signed. This treaty is an extremely valuable contribution to the cause of Soviet-Mongolian friendship and to the development and consolidation of cooperation between the two countries in national economy, culture and education.

　　With the help given by the Soviet Union, the Mongolian people successfully completed the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy and culture.

　　In the announcement of the State Planning Commission of the State Council of the Mongolian People's Republic regarding the development of the national economy and culture of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1949, it was pointed out that the main sector of the national economy, namely animal husbandry, has made great achievements. The total number of livestock increased by 6.5 percent compared to 1948, and in the first two years of the five-year plan (1948-1949), the number of livestock increased by 1,315,900 heads in individually-run economies alone. The cultivated area for sowing grains has also increased. The total amount of grain harvested increased by 48.3 percent. The number of tractors and combine harvesters in the rural economy increased by almost 43 percent. Production cooperatives continued to develop and consolidate in 1949, and the number of production cooperatives increased by 11 percent.

　　Industrial production in various sectors has increased. The announcement pointed out that the construction and opening of the railway from Naushki to Ulaanbaatar was the most important event in 1949, and this railway could only be built successfully with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union.

　　Marshal Choibalsan, Prime Minister of the Mongolian People's Republic, wrote in a congratulatory telegram to Stalin on the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution: "It is precisely because of the victory of the October Socialist Revolution and the friendly Soviet Union's assistance to our country in all aspects that our people have been liberated from social and national oppression and have gained national independence, happiness, and a happy life. This is deeply understood and will never be forgotten by our people."

　　The Soviet Union's help and support for Mongolia has guaranteed Mongolia's independence and consolidated its international position. The Mongolian people are one of the most thorough supporters of the Soviet government's peaceful policy and just principles. The Mongolian people, together with the progressive people of the world, celebrate the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic—the consolidation of the democratic bloc. The Mongolian working masses expressed their deep approval of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

　　苏蒙人民多年来的友谊
    苏联  里昂切夫
    苏蒙关系的全部历史是两国坚牢的友谊的鲜明模范。
    蒙古人民在苏联和全世界劳动者伟大领袖——列宁和斯大林的友谊帮助之下，建立了自己的人民民主国家。苏联早在一九一九年八月就首先向全世界宣布承认蒙古人民有自由、独立的存在权。当时苏维埃政权声明说：“蒙古是自由的国家，任何外国人都无权去干预蒙古的内政。”
    一九二一年十月苏蒙谈判在莫斯科开幕，这次谈判的结果，签定了关于苏蒙两国间建立友谊关系的条约。
    这一条约规定两国互相交换全权代表。条约中显示出苏联人民竭力帮助蒙古人民政治、经济和文化复兴的发展。苏维埃政府废除了从前沙皇政府强迫蒙古签定的不平等条约。革命前沙皇俄罗斯借给蒙古的超过五百万金卢布的借款，也全部勾消，不要偿还。
    苏蒙关系更进一步的发展证明着：列宁——斯大林的关于大小民族平等以及其友好合作的伟大原则作着基础的苏联和平政策，是有牢不可破的力量的。
    一九三四年十一月二十七日在日本军阀发动边界挑衅的环境下，苏蒙政府缔结了口头的协定。其中说到共同警戒和防范外寇武装侵凌的危险和苏联或蒙古人民共和国如受到任何第三国的攻击时，互相间的帮助与支援。从这协定发展下去，一九三六年三月，便在乌兰巴特签定了苏蒙互助条约。这条约成了蒙古人民共和国独立的可靠保证。
    一九三九年五月十一日，当日本帝国主义军队在诺门罕侵入了蒙古人民共和国边界的时候，苏联立即对蒙古人民共和国武装援助，当年八月苏蒙军队迎头击溃了日寇军队。
    苏联人民站仁义的友谊立场，从建立蒙古人民共和国第一天起，就在经济与文化各方面，帮助蒙古人民。苏联政府曾经帮助蒙古人民共和国提高其牧畜业经济——全国国民经济的基础。苏联有系统的把熟练兽医工作人员派往蒙古，把机器、医药品、割草机器站的装备等运往蒙古，这在蒙古牧畜经济的发展上，起着巨大的作用，所有这些都是苏联帮助的表现。由于这种帮助的结果，蒙古共和国牲畜的数量比一九二一年，差不多增加了一倍。
    在苏联的帮助下，蒙古人民共和国建立了装备现代技术的民族工业，建造了巨大的工厂。在二十五年中，工厂的总数增加了二百五十一倍，煤的开采量增加了一百二十六倍。蒙古人民共和国已经设立了现代的邮电机构，建筑了铁道。汽车交通也发展起来。
    苏联科学院及苏联其他科学机关经常帮助蒙古人民共和国发展文化与科学，研究并开采蒙古的天然富源。
    由于苏联在各方面友谊帮助的结果，蒙古人民共和国已由殖民地地位变成了有权威的国家，正在经由非资本主义道路稳步地走向社会主义。
    在蒙古人民共和国已经产生了新的社会主义经济体系，这就是工业中、农村经济中、交通中和邮电方面的国家与合作社企业。这种社会主义经济体系正在继续向前发展。从零售商品流通中对私人资本的限制，对外贸易专营制和统一的国家银行的建立，这一切措施保证了国家更进一步发展的先决条件。
    蒙古人民以深厚的感忱接受伟大邻邦对她的宽宏帮助。一九四五年，蒙古人民在对苏联人民的友谊感情的鼓舞之下，愿意对保障世界和平事业有所贡献，曾向日本帝国主义宣战。蒙古军队曾在华北一带积极参战，消灭日本军队。
    一九四六年二月所签定的苏蒙友好互助条约，更进一步地巩固了苏蒙两国人民的友谊。在签定苏蒙友好互助条约的同时，还签定了苏蒙经济文化合作协定。这个条约在苏蒙友好的事业上，在两国国民经济、文化和教育方面的合作的发展与巩固下，是极宝贵的贡献。
    蒙古人民凭着苏联所给与的帮助，顺利完成了第一届发展国民经济与文化的五年计划。
    在蒙古人民共和国国务院国家计划委员会关于一九四九年蒙古人民共和国国民经济与文化发展的公告中指明：国民经济的主要部门即牧畜业有着很大的成绩。牲畜的总数比一九四八年增加了百分之六点五，在五年计划的头两年中（一九四八——一九四九）单只在独营经济中，牲畜的数量就增加了一百三十一万五千九百头。播种五谷的耕地面积也增加了。收获的粮食总量增加了百分之四十八点三。在农村经济中的拖拉机和康拜因机数量差不多增加了百分之四十三。生产合作社在一九四九年继续发展和巩固起来，生产合作社的数量增加了百分之十一。
    各部门工业生产品增加了。公告中指出，由纳乌斯基到乌兰巴特铁路的筑成与通车，是一九四九年最重要的事件，这条铁道只有在苏联的友谊帮助下，才得以建筑成功。
    蒙古人民共和国国务总理乔巴山大元帅在伟大十月社会主义革命第三十二周年纪念节致斯大林的贺电中写道：“正由于十月社会主义革命的胜利以及友好的苏联在各方面对我国的帮助，我国人民才从社会与民族的压迫下解放出来，才获得了国家独立、幸福与快乐的生活，这是我国人民所深切了解，永远不能忘记的。”
    苏联对蒙古的帮助与支持，保障了蒙古的独立，巩固了它的国际地位。蒙古人民是苏联政府和平政策正义原则的最彻底的赞助者之一。蒙古人民和世界进步人类共同庆祝中华人民共和国与德意志民主共和国的建立——民主阵营的巩固。蒙古劳动群众对于签定中苏友好同盟与互助条约，表示深挚的赞同。
    签定中苏条约是全世界人民在为和平、民主、安全的斗争中，取得伟大新胜利的保证。这个联盟同时也就是蒙古人民共和国独立地位的保证。
    一九四九年十一月底，蒙古人民举行过蒙古人民共和国宣布独立二十五周年纪念节。斯大林在此纪念节致乔巴山元帅的贺电里写道：“蒙古人民数十年来，以刚毅的劳动铲除多年落后的残余，并在提高人民的物质与文化生活方面获得了很大的成就。我希望友好的蒙古人民及其政府在经济与文化建设方面，将获得更进一步的胜利。”
    因对苏联的友谊而获得的胜利是蒙古人民所引以自豪的。
    全世界人民，首先是从帝国主义压迫下争取解放的殖民地与附属国的人民，在苏蒙友谊上，看到苏联建基于斯大林外交政策上的真正平等关系的模范。（Bock特稿）
