　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th. In order to plan and uniformly allocate materials and strengthen basic economic construction in the Northeast, the Northeast People's Government Economic Planning Commission spent more than two months compiling the annual materials allocation plan, enabling various economic departments to have the necessary raw materials, fuels and equipment, providing an important guarantee for the realization of this year's economic plan. The plan focuses on the unified allocation of ten kinds of materials that are of great significance in the state-owned economy, such as steel, coal, electrolytic copper, gasoline, wood, cement, cotton cloth, grain, newsprint, and glass. The remaining forty kinds of materials, such as electrolytic lead, fuel oil, and machine tool, are subject to allocation plans compiled by the competent production departments, submitted to the Economic Planning Commission for review and submitted to the Northeast People's Government for record.

　　The materials allocation plan formulated by the Northeast People's Government Economic Planning Commission was approved by the Northeast People's Government and began to be implemented at the end of May. Due to the unified allocation of materials, various economic departments in the Northeast have been able to rationally use national resources in a planned way, reduce backlogs, and overcome waste. Before the plan was prepared, there were some imbalances in the production and supply of various departments. The supply of five materials, namely cement, wood, electrolytic copper, newsprint and grain, fell short of demand, while steel was heavily stockpiled. After unified allocation, not only was supply and demand balanced, but there was also a slight surplus. For example, the approved cement allocation volume only accounted for 75.5% of the application volume, and wood accounted for 80%. The total difference between the original application volume and the final approved allocation volume of the ten major materials is equivalent to 6 trillion Northeast currency, which is about 1 million tons of coarse grains.

　　The Northeast People's Government Economic Planning Commission started preparing the materials allocation plan as early as February this year. The committee first studied the production, construction plans, and material consumption quotas of industrial, trade, and financial institutions in Northeast China this year as the basis for formulating the plan. After drafting the draft in April, it successively convened various materials allocation meetings to discuss and approve the applications for raw materials submitted by various departments. During the review, a reasonable adjustment was first made based on the overall consideration of this year's economic plan, distinguishing between primary and secondary priorities. When certain materials are insufficient to meet the overall needs, priority is given to ensuring the needs of the leading sectors of the national economy. For those units that apply for too much, a reasonable reduction is given. The committee also made reasonable adjustments to the allocation plan based on the difference between seasonal production and seasonal needs. For example, coal is produced seasonally, but large quantities are needed in spring and winter. If the coal-using departments receive it in these two seasons, it will inevitably cause stockpiling in mines in summer and autumn, affecting production. On the other hand, railway transportation has always been slack in summer and autumn and crowded in winter. The allocation meeting combined the production, allocation, and transportation plans based on this situation, and stipulated the allocation figures for coal each season, thus completely overcoming the imbalance in seasonal transportation and the contradiction between seasonal production and needs. When preparing the plan, the committee also paid attention to the use of inventory materials. For some departments that applied for the allocation of materials without deducting inventory materials, a re-examination was carried out.

　　After gaining experience in the unified allocation plan for major materials, the Northeast People's Government Economic Planning Commission plans to gradually expand the types of allocation of industrial and agricultural products, and to include the main products that the Northeast region transports to other regions and abroad, and the main materials that need to be supplied from other regions and abroad, into the materials allocation plan. Some preparatory work will also be carried out from now on for the promotion of private enterprise products and the supply of raw materials, so as to gradually include private enterprises in the economic plan through the materials balance plan.

　　为经济建设提供有力保证
    东北实行物资分配计划
    各经济部门已能合理使用资源减少浪费
    【新华社沈阳三十日电】为了有计划的统一分配物资，加强东北基本经济建设工作，东北人民政府经济计划委员会以两个多月的时间编制完成了本年度物资分配计划，使各经济部门拥有必需的原材料、燃料及装备，为今年经济计划的实现提供了重要保证。该计划着重对在国营经济中具有重要意义的钢铁、煤炭、电解铜、汽油、木材、水泥、棉布、粮食、新闻纸、玻璃等十种物资作了统一分配。其余如电解铅、燃料油、机械母机等四十种物资则由各生产主管部门编制分配计划，交经济计划委员会审定转呈东北人民政府备案。
    东北人民政府经济计划委员会制订的物资分配计划经东北人民政府批准后，于五月末开始实行。由于物资的统一分配，已使东北各个经济部门能够有计划地合理使用国家资源，减少积压，克服浪费。在编制该计划之前，各部门生产与供应存在若干不平衡现象。水泥、木材、电解铜、新闻纸和粮食五种物资供不应求，而钢材则被大量积压。经过统一分配以后，不但达到供求平衡，且略有敷余。如审定后的水泥分配量只占申请量的百分之七十五点五，木材占百分之八十。总计十种主要物资原来申请量与最后审定分配量的总差额，相当于东北币六万亿元，约合粗粮一百万吨。
    东北人民政府经济计划委员会早于今年二月即着手编制物资分配计划。委员会首先研究了东北本年度工业、贸易、财经机关的生产、修建计划及物资消费的定额，作为制订计划的根据。四月份拟订草案后，便连续分别召开各种物资分配会议，根据各部门提出的需用原材料申请书加以讨论审定。在审定中首先根据今年经济计划全盘考虑，分别主次缓急进行合理调整。当某些物资不敷全面需要时，则首先保证国民经济中主导部门的需要。对某些单位申请过多者，则合理地予以削减。委员会又根据季节生产与季节需要的差别，将分配计划加以合理调整。如煤炭是按季生产，而大量需要则在春冬两季，如用煤部门都在该两季去领，势必使夏秋两季矿山积压，影响生产。另一方面，铁路运输历来是夏秋清淡，冬季拥挤。分配会议即根据这种情况，把生产、分配、运输的计划结合起来，规定煤炭每季的分配数字，这样便完全克服了季节运输不平衡，和季节性生产与需要的矛盾。在编制计划时，委员会也注意了对库存物资的运用。对某些部门在申请拨付物资时，其未扣除库存物资者，均加以重新审定。
    在主要物资统一分配计划取得经验后，东北人民政府经济计划委员会拟逐步扩大工农产品分配的种类，并使东北区向国外区外运销的主要产品，和需要区外国外供给的主要物资，均编制在物资分配计划之内。对私营企业产品的推销和原料的供给，也将从现在起进行若干准备工作，以便经过物资平衡计划，把私营企业逐步地包括在经济计划之中。
