Xinhua News Agency, August 3rd: The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has issued the "Provisional Outline of Work for Propagandists" as follows:

　　I. In order to strengthen the systematic and regular propaganda and education work of the League, the League committees at and above the district level must gradually establish propagandists to assist branches in carrying out propaganda and education work.

　　II. The tasks of the propagandists (currently, the first item is generally the central task):

　　(1) To be responsible for the teaching work of League classes, to draft and discuss the teaching outlines of League classes based on the educational plan of the League committee and the political and cultural level of the League members, and to lecture League members according to the outlines, answering questions in the course of study.

　　(2) To carry out propaganda and education work for the masses outside the League, using speeches, lectures, individual talks, writing, and various mobilization methods to explain the policies of the Party and the People's Government, explain current affairs issues, and promote mass work.

　　(3) To study the instructions and resolutions of the League committee, grasp their spirit and essence, and explain them to the League members in a timely manner.

　　(4) To regularly collect and study the problems that occur in the thinking, life, and work of young people inside and outside the League, so that they can be combined with reality when lecturing on League classes and conducting various propaganda and education activities.

　　(5) To pay attention to understanding the general situation of the League branch and reflect it to the higher-level League committee for reference.

　　III. General principles for establishing propagandists:

　　(1) Qualifications of propagandists: Cadres, Party members, or League members with a certain political and cultural level and mass work experience. Subject to review and approval by the next higher level League committee.

　　(2) Allocation of propagandists:

　　(a) Full-time: League committees at the provincial and municipal levels and above must establish a certain number of full-time propagandists, and the number shall be determined from the total number of cadre positions according to needs. League committees at the regional level and provincial League committees that have established League schools can draw quotas from the League school establishment and select qualified students to serve. League committees below the prefectural committee need not establish full-time propagandists.

　　(b) Part-time: League committees at all levels can set up part-time propagandists, in cities, they can be concurrently held by political teachers in universities and middle schools, cadres in government agencies and factories, Party members or League members with higher political and cultural levels; in rural areas, they can be concurrently held by primary school teachers among League members or village cadres, Party members or League members with higher cultural levels.

　　(3) Leadership issues of propagandists:

　　(a) Standing committees of League committees at all levels should formulate League propaganda and education plans, guide, review, and help propagandists draft lecture outlines for League classes and carry out other work. Where possible, organizations such as League education committees can be established. The routine work of propagandists shall be led by the propaganda department of the respective level of the League committee.

　　(b) When propagandists carry out propaganda and education work in various places, they are subject to the leadership of the respective level of the League committee.

　　IV. Methods of conducting League classes:

　　(1) The general procedure for propagandists to conduct lectures: According to the topics decided by the respective level of the League committee, coordinate with relevant departments to collect the specific situation of the branch, and conduct thorough research in combination with required readings and reference materials. Aiming at the problems found, draft a teaching outline suitable for the audience, and proceed with explanation only after it has been reviewed and approved by the League committee.

　　(2) The general principles for propagandists to conduct lectures in various situations: In cities, lectures can be conducted separately by factories, schools, and government agencies; in scattered rural areas, the method of dissemination stations can be widely used, that is, dissemination stations can be established at several suitable villages and towns within a district as base points, and comrades with higher political and cultural levels, especially primary school teachers, can be selected as village propagandists (or branch propagandists). The village propagandists (branch propagandists) will lecture according to the outline lectured by the district propagandist (or the lecturer at the dissemination station) at the dissemination station, the textbooks and teaching materials compiled by the higher-level League committee, and in combination with the actual situation of the village.

　　(3) When propagandists conduct lectures in various branches, non-League youth who voluntarily participate may attend. Propagandists may use the form of large classes when lecturing, but the attendees must be fixed. Where possible, they should be grouped according to political and cultural level. After each course is completed, an examination must be conducted and the results recorded.

　　V. Code of Conduct for Propagandists:

　　(1) Propagandists should be serious and responsible, and hold the attitude of "knowing is knowing, not knowing is not knowing." In lectures or in other propaganda work, any questions that cannot be answered on the spot should be taken back for research and then answered. If any mistakes are found in the lectures, they should be corrected next time.

　　(2) Unless specifically entrusted, propagandists are not responsible for any leadership responsibilities other than teaching.

　　(3) Propagandists must regard improving their own political theory and League knowledge as an important and regular task. After each lecture, they should humbly listen to the feedback from the masses as an important reference for improving teaching content and methods.

　　(4) When propagandists explain, they should not "read from the book." They should enrich the explanation with vivid and lively examples or stories that are in line with reality based on the lecture outline, and explain it in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.
