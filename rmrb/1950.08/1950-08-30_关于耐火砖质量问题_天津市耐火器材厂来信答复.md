To the Editor:

Regarding the criticism of our factory by comrades Gao Shanming and Xu Zhongyi of the Hangu Town Committee, published in your newspaper on August 8th, we dispatched personnel to Hangu on the 9th to understand the details of the damage at the Heji Chemical Factory in conjunction with the Town Committee comrades. It is understood that the Heji Chemical Factory is a sodium sulfide manufacturing plant. In the past, the factory's reverberatory furnace for manufacturing sodium sulfide was built with SK35 refractory bricks from the Tangshan Desheng Pottery Factory, but they would fail in less than a month. Later, the factory saw that our factory produced SK37 (refractoriness of 1825 degrees Celsius) high-alumina bricks, which had higher refractoriness than SK35 bricks and were denser, so they purchased a batch of SK37 bricks from our factory to use. However, the results were very poor, and cracks were found after firing. After adding materials (mirabilite and charcoal), when the temperature was around 1000 degrees, the bricks in contact with the materials gradually expanded, and the fire stop also arched, causing the bricks to fall off and resulting in production downtime for furnace repairs. According to our inspection, the expansion of the returned damaged bricks was abnormal, with thickness variations reaching 15%, exceeding the maximum expansion rate of 3% for this brick at its melting point. Our entire factory conducted several days of review, research, and testing. At 1650 degrees Celsius, the compressive strength was 55 pounds per square inch (tested by the Applied Chemistry Institute of Nankai University). This proves that the refractoriness and composition of SK37 meet the specifications. There were also no cracks when we tested the kiln at the Tianjin Dyeing Factory.

Our review is as follows:

1. High-alumina bricks are suitable for steelmaking furnace applications (the Tianjin Xinxing Iron and Steel Company's vertical pig iron furnace found the results satisfactory). However, we lack knowledge about the effects on other chemical agents and have not conducted research and testing. We only focused on refractoriness and did not pay enough attention to the different uses, which affected the production of Heji and Tianjin Dyeing Factories and caused losses to the people's wealth. In the future, to truly serve our customers, we plan to improve our testing equipment, gradually master the uses and performance of various types of fire bricks, and establish close contact with customers. We will first understand the customer's use and requirements when selling goods to ensure that we no longer sell blindly.
2. The Liaoxi Province Hangu Raw Material Factory can use our factory's SK34 refractory bricks (1,700 yuan per piece) for sodium sulfide production for more than twenty days to a month, which is the same as when using Desheng Pottery's SK35 bricks, while SK37 fire bricks expand in the reverberatory furnace. This proves that it is not related to refractoriness, but rather to other effects. Our factory's laboratory is currently studying this.
3. As for how to manufacture bricks suitable for sodium sulfide production in the future, the Industrial Bureau's Technology Department convened a symposium of technical personnel from affiliated factories on August 18th to identify several avenues for further research and modification. The Technology Department is currently assisting in this process, and we hope that refractory material experts from all regions will provide valuable opinions for improvement.

### 关于耐火砖质量问题  天津市耐火器材厂来信答复

　　关于耐火砖质量问题
    天津市耐火器材厂来信答复编辑同志：
    八月八日贵报登载汉沽镇委高善明、徐中宜二同志对我厂的批评，九日我们即派专人去汉沽，会同镇委同志去合记化学厂了解损坏的经过情形。据了解，合记化学厂是制硫化碱工厂。过去，该厂制硫化碱的反射炉，是使用唐山德盛窑业工厂的ＳＫ３５号耐火砖砌的，但不到一个月就要坏；后来该厂看到我厂出品ＳＫ３７号（耐火度摄氏１８２５度）高铝砖，耐火度比ＳＫ３５砖高，且质地紧密，于是向本厂购买一批ＳＫ３７号砖去使用。但结果非常不好，烤火后发现有裂痕。加料后（芒硝与碳木）当温度在１０００度左右时，与料接触的砖即逐渐膨胀，火挡也拱起，以致砖脱槽掉下，遭受停工修炉的损失。根据我们的检查，带回来的坏砖膨胀情况不正常，厚薄方面达百分之十五，超过该砖在熔点下最高膨胀率百分之三强。我们全厂又进行了数天检讨研究、试验，在摄氏１６５０度时，每平方英寸耐压力５５磅（经南开大学应用化学所试验过）。证明ＳＫ３７耐火度及配合成分，均合乎规格。在我厂与天津染料厂试验烤炉时，也没有裂痕。
    我们的检讨是：
    一、高铝砖是合乎钢铁制造炉的用途（天津新兴钢铁公司立式化铁炉使用结果认为满意），至于对其他化学药剂性能的影响，则我们缺乏认识，也没有作研究试验。只顾了耐火度，没有深刻注意到用途上的不同，以致影响了合记及天津染料厂的生产，使人民财富受到损失。今后为达到真诚为顾主服务之目的，我们准备充实试验设备，逐步掌握各种各号火砖之用途及性能，并与顾主取得密切连系，售货时首先了解顾主的用途及要求，保证不再盲目推销。
    二、辽西省汉沽原料厂使用本厂ＳＫ３４耐火砖（每块一千七百元）制硫化碱可用到二十余天到一个月，和德盛窑业ＳＫ３５号砖使用时相同，而ＳＫ３７火砖在反射炉却形膨胀。这证明不是耐火度的关系，而是还有其他作用，现本厂化验室正研究中。
    三、至于今后如何制造适用制硫化碱用砖的问题，工业局技术室已于八月十八日召集所属厂技术人员座谈会，找出进一步研究改制的几个途径。现正由技术室协助进行中，并望各地耐火器材专家多提宝贵意见，以资改进。
