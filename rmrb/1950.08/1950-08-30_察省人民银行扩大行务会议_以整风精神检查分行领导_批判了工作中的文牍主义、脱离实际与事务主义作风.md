　　[Report from our newspaper in Zhangjiakou] Following the conclusion of the rectification meeting convened by the Chahar Provincial Committee, the Chahar Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China specifically convened an expanded working conference on July 27th. This conference included the directors of each special district office, the directors of each city business department, and all cadres at or above the deputy section chief level of the provincial branch. The conference, in the spirit of rectification, initially examined the leadership and working style of the branch since entering the city. It also determined to effectively overcome bureaucracy and improve the leadership of the branch by focusing on the current central tasks: reorganizing the organization, reforming cadres, adjusting public-private relations, and managing cash.
　　The meeting pointed out: The leadership of the branch has been basically correct for more than a year. This is reflected in the fact that the branch has basically completed the tasks assigned by higher authorities in the past year and a half, has corrected and implemented policies, and has been decisive in solving problems, grasping new work tightly. Especially in the past six months, it has gradually strived for initiative in its work, and leading cadres have begun to go to the countryside to help banks at all levels deal with problems, thus gaining the trust of lower-level banks. It has also enabled lower-level banks to learn some new things and opened up a new working situation, which is an achievement that cannot be ignored. However, upon strict examination, there are still many shortcomings, mainly "hard-working bureaucracy," which has caused no small losses to the work.
　　First, there are many written instructions and little concrete assistance: It mainly relies on written leadership and is mired in bureaucracy. Currently, the new banks at the lower levels, especially the county banks, generally cannot understand the written instructions, and their summary reports are incomplete. Therefore, relying solely on written leadership is not as effective as going down to provide concrete assistance and understand the situation. In the past, when the branch went to the countryside, it mostly went to the offices, and mostly helped to hold meetings, rarely going deep into the county banks, especially paying insufficient attention to remote counties. Some leading cadres went down not to help with the work, but simply to collect materials.
　　Second, the assignment of tasks and work plans do not conform to the situation at the lower levels and are blindly made: Due to the lack of visits to the countryside, there is a lack of systematic investigation and understanding of the situation in the entire province. Therefore, the allocation of tasks and the preparation of work plans inevitably involve serious blindness. For example, the deposit target set at the second quarter financial meeting was 35 billion, but the actual deposit balance at the end of June reached 81 billion. Conversely, the loan plan of 7 billion arranged in May only lent out 3 billion, which added some trouble to the lower levels. On the other hand, it also manifested "transmission from above and implementation below," and insufficient effort was made to concretize the general policies and tasks according to the different situations in different regions within the province.
　　Third, the answers to questions from the bank director and section chiefs, between sections, and between section chiefs and staff members are inconsistent, showing a lack of coordination, and sometimes a lack of seriousness in solving problems.
　　Fourth, there are too many forms and reports, some even duplicated, and too many temporary requests for materials from below, resulting in false reports. For example, there are currently thirty-two types of forms and reports, and more than one thousand accounting subjects. The lower levels cannot complete them, which defeats their purpose. There is insufficient accumulation of materials in peacetime, and temporary requests are made by telephone when needed. Also, because the procedures for form and report statistics are too complicated, some county banks have specially set up two or three people to compile the forms and reports, but they still cannot submit them. The temporary requests for materials are too urgent, resulting in many false or very untrue reports when the lower levels have no materials.
　　Finally, consideration of work is not thorough, the handling of problems changes quickly, the leadership sometimes commits to routine matters, and the expenditure system is lenient to the upper levels and strict to the lower levels: For example, the head office has already instructed that the actual deposits in previous current accounts can be transferred to principal-protected and value-protected deposits, but the branch does not agree to the transfer, which makes the account holders of current accounts dissatisfied. The work is rough and careless, some of the circulars are untrue, big problems are not seen, and small problems are grasped very tightly. The cooperative loan repayment and interest problems cannot be changed when discussed at the sub-branch, but can be changed when discussed at the branch, and the problems of the sub-branch are directly handled without going through the special district leadership. As a result, the sub-branch manager does not dare to decide on buying a table or a spittoon. Bad cadres are assigned to the lower levels, and the ideological problems are not solved, but simply avoided. All this adds to the difficulties of the lower levels, makes it impossible to implement the work, and seriously affects the development of the work.
　　In view of the above situation, the meeting determined the central tasks for the autumn: First, in combination with the current rectification movement and the discipline inspection arranged by the head office, the slack business season in autumn will be used to seize the work of reorganizing the organization and reforming cadres.
　　Second, in terms of cash management: thoroughly implement the return of cash to the bank and eliminate blank accounts. Although the branch has basically completed this point, it is necessary to consolidate this achievement; and conditionally try out the revenue and expenditure plan and the disbursement plan, develop transfer and clearing, and gradually develop in the direction of a credit center and clearing center, so as to improve the cash management work. Other receipts and deposits, building gold treasuries, flexible allocation, deposit, lending, remittance, agricultural loans, etc., are regular work.
　　In order to achieve the above tasks, it was specifically decided that: In the future, in addition to the establishment of an inspection section and the organization of more cadres to go to the countryside to specifically help understand the problems, the issue of forms and reports is being studied and planned to be reduced. Attention should also be paid to systematic investigation, accumulation of materials, and efforts should be made to avoid the occurrence of temporary urgent requests from below. In the future, when planning to assign tasks, it is necessary to resolutely overcome blindness, and try to seek the opinions of the lower levels first, and then determine them. Other issues such as salaries should also be carefully handled and resolved.

　　察省人民银行扩大行务会议
    以整风精神检查分行领导
    批判了工作中的文牍主义、脱离实际与事务主义作风
    【本报张家口讯】中国人民银行察哈尔省分行，在省委召开的整风会议结束后，特于七月二十七日召开了有各专区办事处主任、各市营业部主任及分行副科长以上全体干部参加的扩大行务会议，会议以整风精神初步检查入城以来的分行领导及工作作风。并确定围绕当前中心工作：整顿组织、改造干部、调整公私关系、现金管理等，有效地克服官僚主义，改进分行领导。
    会议指出：一年多来分行领导基本上是正确的。这表现在一年半以来，分行基本上完成了上级所给的任务，并端正、执行了政策，解决问题果断，对新工作抓的紧。尤其近半年来，工作上逐步争取了主动，领导干部也开始下乡帮助各级行处理问题，因而也就取得了下级行的信任。并使下级行学到了一些新的东西，打开了新的工作的局面，这是不可忽视的成绩。但严格检查起来，仍存在了不少的缺点，主要的是“辛辛苦苦的官僚主义”，使工作招致了不小的损失。
    首先是文字指示多，具体帮助少：主要依靠文字领导，陷于文牍主义。目前各行新建，一般县行看文字看不通，写总结报告不完全，因此单靠文字领导，就不如多下去具体帮助了解情况收效大。分行过去下乡，多半到办事处，而又多是帮助召开会议，很少深入到县行去，尤其对偏远县份更注意不够。还有的领导干部下去不帮助工作，仅单纯搜集材料。
    其次是任务分配、工作计划不符合下边情况，带有盲目性：由于下乡少，对全省情况缺乏系统的调查和了解，因此在分配任务做工作计划时，便必然带有严重的盲目性。如第二季金融会议布置的存款任务三百五十亿，到六月底实际存款余额达八百一十亿。相反，五月份布置的贷款计划七十亿，只贷出三十亿，反给下边增加了一些麻烦。另一方面，则表现了“上传下达”、“等因奉此”，在总方针任务下按照省内不同地区不同情况再加以具体化，则做的很不够。
    第三是行长与科长之间、科与科之间、科长与行员之间答复问题不一致，表现了不协调的现象，因此有时就表现了对问题解决不够严肃。
    第四是表报太多，甚至有的重复，向下边临时要材料多，致形成假报告。如现行表报有三十二种，会计科目一千多个，下边做不来，反失去了效用。平时积累材料不够，用时则在电话上临时要。又由于表报统计手续太繁，有的县行专设两、三人统计表报，还报不上来。临时要材料又太急，致下边没有材料时便作了不少假报告，或者很不真实。
    最后，对工作考虑不周到，处理问题变动快，领导上有时犯事务主义，开支制度上宽下严：如总行已指示前存折实存款可转保本保值存款，分行不同意转，使折实存户不满意。工作上粗枝大叶，通报有的不真实，大问题看不见，小问题反抓的很紧。合作社贷款还款和利息问题在支行谈不能变，到分行谈就变了，也不经过专区领导就直接处理支行问题。致使支行经理买个桌子、痰盂也不敢做主。坏干部分配到下边去，不解决思想问题，单纯进行回避。这一切都给下边增加了困难，使工作无法执行，严重影响着工作的开展。
    针对以上情况，会议确定秋季中心工作：一、结合当前整风运动，及总行布置的纪律检查，利用秋季业务淡月，抓紧整顿组织，改造干部工作。
    二、在现金管理方面：彻底实行现金归行，消灭空白户。这一点该行虽已基本上完成，但要巩固这个成绩；并有条件地试办收支计划、出纳计划，开展转账划拨，逐步向信贷中心、清算中心方向发展，使现金管理工作提高一步。其他收存款、建金库、灵活调拨、存、放、汇、农贷等等，则为经常工作。
    为了实现上述任务，并具体决定：今后除将成立检查科，多组织干部下乡，具体帮助了解问题外，表报问题正在研究计划减少。并要注意做系统调查，积累材料，尽力避免临时向下急要的情形发生。今后计划分配任务时要坚决克服盲目性，尽量先争取下边意见，然后确定。其他如薪金等问题也均要慎重的处理和解决。
