　　Northwest Industry Department Inspects Bureaucracy
    Failure to Grasp the Overall Situation and Passive Leadership are the Main Problems in Current Work.
    [This newspaper's report] According to the Masses Daily News: In the movement against bureaucracy in the Northwest Industry Department, after more than a month of studying documents, inspecting work, and conducting discussions and analysis, significant problems have been exposed, such as the leading cadres' insufficient understanding of the actual situation and passivity in leadership.

    For a relatively long period, the department focused on the leadership of factories in the Guanzhong area, and lacked sufficient understanding of the specific situation of the entire Northwest industry, such as the number of people, capital, and production and sales. Therefore, the department could not offer more leading opinions on the requests from below. The shutdown of the Longxian Coal Mine is one example. The comrade in charge of the mine did not make proper estimates of coal production, transportation, and sales, and requested to expand production. The Northwest Industry Department did not have a comprehensive grasp of the situation and lacked foresight, so it approved the mine's request to continue expanding production. As a result, after the Longhai Railway opened to traffic, coal from Henan was transported to Shaanxi, and the mine's coal could not be transported and sold. By April of this year, it had to shut down. This kind of leadership that deviates from reality inevitably prevents the department from formulating plans based on the overall industrial situation in the Northwest, and it cannot actively lead the construction of Northwest industry. The problem of managing state-owned enterprises also reflects passivity. Although the former Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Enterprise Department convened a joint meeting of state-owned factory directors in September last year and decided to implement the principles of enterprise management and democratic management, there was a lack of concrete guidance and inspection on how to implement them. It was not until the publication of this newspaper's editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises" that the Northwest Industry Department began to pay attention to the issue of democratic management and inspected the democratic management situation of each factory. After the first Northwest Regional Industrial Conference in April, democratic management was universally implemented in various factories. The losses suffered in production during these months of delay can be imagined. The leadership of private industrial and mining enterprises has also failed to play an active leading role. The private Minsheng Cotton Mill initially proposed to lay off sixteen people (out of more than 140 in the whole factory) because of poor production, but the trade union did not agree. As a result, the factory lost money, reduced production, and finally stopped production. The Industry Department knew about this matter for a long time, but due to insufficient attention, it dragged on and caused losses.

    One of the reasons for this detachment from reality is the handicraft-style working methods of the leadership. The leading comrades of the department often try to handle everything themselves, personally taking care of everything in their daily work, and are busy holding meetings and answering official documents, but they neglect the leadership of principled and major issues, resulting in shortcomings and errors in their work.

    Now, the department is preparing to conduct an in-depth inspection of all problems, further analyze and study them, and has begun to establish or improve some systems.

### 西北工业部检查官僚主义  掌握全面情况不够，领导处于被动，是当前工作中的主要问题。

　　西北工业部检查官僚主义
    掌握全面情况不够，领导处于被动，是当前工作中的主要问题。
    【本报讯】据群众日报消息：西北工业部在反对官僚主义运动中，经过一个多月的学习文件，检查工作，讨论和分析，已暴露出领导干部对实际情况了解不够，领导工作被动等重要问题。
    该部在较长时期中，偏重于关中区各工厂的领导工作，对整个西北工业的具体情况，如人数、资金、产销等则了解很不够。因此，该部对下边的请示不能提出更多的有领导性的意见。例如陇县煤矿停产就是一例。该矿负责同志对煤的出产、运输、销售未做适当估计就要求扩大生产。西北工业部对全面的情况掌握不够，又缺乏预见性，就根据该矿的要求，批准其继续扩大生产。结果，陇海铁路通车后，河南煤运到陕西，该矿的煤就无法运销，到今年四月便只好停产。这种脱离实际的领导，就必然使该部不能根据整个西北的工业情况提出计划，而对西北工业的建设也就不能主动地加以领导。如对公营企业的管理问题，即表现了被动。去年九月间原陕甘宁边区企业厅虽已召开各公营工厂厂长联席会议，决定实行经营企业化、管理民主化的方针。但究竟如何实行，却缺乏具体的指导和检查。直到本报“学会管理企业”社论发表后，西北工业部才开始重视民主管理问题，检查了各厂民主管理情况。四月西北区第一届工业大会以后，民主管理才在各厂普遍的实行。在拖延的这几个月中，生产上所受到的损失是可以想见的。对于私营工矿业的领导，也是没有发挥主动的领导作用。私营民生纱厂因为生产情况不好，最初提出要裁减十六个人（全厂一百四十余人），但工会不答应，结果是赔本，减产，最后是停止生产。工业部早就知道这件事情，但由于重视不够，以致拖延下来而造成损失。
    造成脱离实际的原因之一，是领导上的手工业工作方法。该部领导同志对日常工作往往是一把抓，事事亲自动手，忙于召开会议，批答公文，但却疏忽了原则性的重大问题的领导，结果就产生了工作中的缺点和错误。
    现在该部正准备对所有问题作深入检查，进一步分析研究，并已经着手建立或改进一些制度。
