　　Youth League Central Committee Issues Instructions
    Responding to the CCP's Party Rectification and Cadre Review Work
    Calling on League Cadres to Participate in the Rectification Movement
    [By Our Newspaper] According to Xinhua News Agency, August 4th: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League issued instructions on August 4, 1950, regarding responding to the Chinese Communist Party's Party Rectification and Cadre Review Work. The full text is as follows:
    The CCP Central Committee issued instructions in May of this year regarding the Party Rectification and Cadre Review Work, deciding that the entire Party should "conduct a large-scale rectification movement," with "the first step being the rectification of cadre work styles." In this rectification movement, the consciousness of all comrades in the Party will be further enhanced, shortcomings in our progress will be overcome, the connection between the Party and the people will be strengthened, the people's democratic dictatorship will be consolidated, and the construction work of our entire country will advance more rapidly and steadily.
    Our China New Democratic Youth League—the Party's close assistant and reserve force—should enthusiastically support and respond to the Party's rectification movement. Therefore, we have decided that all levels of the League's cadres detached from production and all League member cadres in various organs should, without exception, actively participate in the Party's rectification movement, study documents under the leadership of the Party, review work, and engage in criticism and self-criticism. In this rectification movement, we must conscientiously examine and overcome the bureaucracy, commandism, and various undesirable work styles that exist among League cadres and affect the relationship between the League and the masses. However, it must be clearly understood that this is the participation of cadres from all levels of the League and League member cadres in various organs in the rectification movement led by Party committees at all levels, and it is not the Youth League itself conducting a full-League rectification. Therefore, we are not currently asking all League members to participate in this rectification movement, nor is it appropriate to put forward the slogan of "rectifying the League."
    The reason we only require League cadres to actively participate in the Party's rectification movement and do not require a full-League rectification is that our League organization has not been established for long. In many places, it is still beginning or is in the process of being established. The organizational foundation of the League is not yet very solid, the League's leadership backbone is relatively weak, and the ideological level and work experience of general League members are also relatively poor. Under these circumstances, if a full-League rectification movement is launched rashly, it will inevitably be difficult to grasp correctly, and deviations will easily occur in practical work, failing to achieve good results. Therefore, at present, the main focus for the vast number of League members is to strengthen regular intra-League education, not to carry out a large-scale rectification movement.
    Taking this step in the rectification movement not only conforms to the actual situation of the current Youth League work, but also conforms to the spirit of the Party Central Committee's instruction that "the first step is the rectification of cadre work styles."
    In order to promptly understand the participation of League cadres at all levels and League member cadres in various organs in the Party-led rectification movement, please report the progress in your region or department to us on a regular basis.

　　青年团中央发布指示
    响应中共整党整干工作
    号召团的干部参加整风运动
    【本报讯】据新华社四日讯：中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会于一九五○年八月四日发布关于响应中国共产党整党整干工作的指示，全文如下：
    中共中央已于今年五月发布了整党整干工作的指示，决定全党“进行一次大规模的整风运动”，“首先是整顿干部作风”。在这一整风运动中，将进一步提高全党同志的觉悟，克服前进中的缺点，密切党与人民群众的联系，巩固人民民主专政，使我们整个国家的建设工作，更加迅速而稳步的前进。
    我们中国新民主主义青年团——党的亲密的助手与后备军，应当热烈地拥护与响应党的这一整风运动。因此，我们决定：团的各级脱离生产的干部和各机关中的团员干部，均应毫无例外地积极参加党的整风运动，在党的领导下学习文件，检查工作，展开批评与自我批评。在这一整风运动中，要认真地检讨和克服存在于团内干部中的官僚主义、命令主义以及影响团和群众关系的各种不良作风。但是必须认识清楚：这是各级团的干部和各机关中的团员干部去参加各级党所领导的整风运动，不是青年团本身进行全团的整风。因此，现在并不是要求全体团员参加这一整风运动，更不宜提出“整团”的口号。
    我们所以只要求团的干部积极参加党的整风运动，并不要求进行全团的整风，是因为我们团的组织建立还不久，不少地方还是开始或正在建立，团的组织基础还不是很巩固，团的领导骨干较弱，一般团员的思想水平和工作经验也较差，在这种情况下，如果贸然发动全团的整风运动势必难以正确地掌握，在实际工作上将容易发生偏差，不能收到很好的效果。因此，目前对广大的团员，主要地是加强经常的团内教育，不是进行大规模的整风运动。
    我们在整风运动中采取这种步骤，不但是符合于现在青年团工作的实际情况，同时也符合于党中央所指示的“首先是整顿干部作风”的精神。
    为了及时了解各级团的干部和各机关的团员干部参加党所领导的整风运动的情况，请各团委将本地区或本部门的进行情形按期报告我们。
