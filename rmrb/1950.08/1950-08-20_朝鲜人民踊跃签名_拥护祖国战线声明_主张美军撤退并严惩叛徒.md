Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 18th (TASS dispatch): All Korean people welcome and support the statement of the Central Committee of the United Democratic Fatherland Front, demanding that the United Nations guarantee the immediate withdrawal of foreign interventionist troops from Korea and try the chief people's traitors headed by Syngman Rhee, who are the instigators of the civil war and the active accomplices of the American imperialists waging war against the Korean people.

The movement to sign the Fatherland Front's statement was widely launched on August 16 in enterprises and organizations in Pyongyang. Many mass rallies were held in Pyongyang and its neighboring villages. At the meetings, workers and peasants signed the statement. They said that they are determined to continue the struggle until the foreign interventionists are driven out of the country.

Factory worker Cao Wen Gao (transliteration) said after signing: All Korean people have risen to participate in this sacred war against foreign interventionists; they demand that American troops immediately withdraw from Korea.

Coal miner Jin Wenbang (transliteration) who signed his name said: I support the statement of the Central Committee of the United Democratic Fatherland Front, demanding the arrest and interrogation of Syngman Rhee, Lee Beom-seok and other instigators of the civil war. They have committed heinous crimes and are now desperately helping American imperialists wage war against the Korean people. This group of people's traitors not only obstructed the unification of our motherland, but also arrested and killed supporters of democracy. I have signed my name: I guarantee to fight against these traitors until complete victory.
