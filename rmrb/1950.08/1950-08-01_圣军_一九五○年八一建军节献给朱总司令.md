　　Holy Army
    Huang Yanpei
    Dedicated to Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the August 1st Army Day, 1950
           (I)
　
    Since humanity began,
      never has such an army been seen,
    Any ferocious enemy—
      Chiang Kai-shek, with millions of troops in the army, navy, and air force,
    before it,
      shattered.
    Any modern equipment—
      American imperialism, giving to Chiang Kai-shek, airplanes, cannons, tanks, batch after batch,
    before it,
      taken together with the men and equipment.
　
           (II)
　
    What is this!
      Despite winning every battle,
    why does it not feel terrifying,
      only feel—
    lovable,
      respectable!
    Every big city,
      liberated,
    standing in the wind and rain,
      lying by the roadside,
      not even drinking a glass of water offered to them.
    The common people surged forward,
      eagerly—
    welcoming it,
      embracing it,
    inseparably.
      Ah!
    How can it possibly be "separated" from the common people!
    It is the common people itself.
　
           (III)
　
    "Arise!
    Arise!
      You who refuse to be slaves!"
    Only the people themselves can liberate the people.
      Nearly all of modern Chinese history,
    clearly writes:
    The "May Fourth" Movement was the first cry of an organized mass movement;
      later it underwent many trials,
    absorbed much experience;
    The "August First" Uprising marked the beginning of the people led by the Chinese Communist Party to formally arm themselves
      to launch revolutionary war.
      It also endured highly difficult long-term hardships,
      which are too numerous to count!
      Do not forget!
    Do not forget!
    The 25,000-li Long March.
　
       (IV)
　
    25,000 li,
      it from the Five Ridges in the South,
    circled a large loop westward,
      and arrived at the Great Wall in northern Shaanxi.
    Iron was forged into steel,
      seeing wave after wave of fleeing enemy troops like falling flowers and flowing water.
    From then on,
      it penetrated deeply into the countryside,
    how to harvest in the autumn?
      how to plow in the spring?
    Absorbing as much practical and rich life experience and political experience as possible,
      gaining full life from hardships.
    Relying on heaven?
      Relying on others?
    No,
      no,
    self-reliance!
　
           (V)
　
    Eight years of resistance against Japan,
      it grew stronger from the highly difficult and long-term hardships.
    One team guerilla on the left,
      one team guerilla on the right,
    from Heilongjiang connected to Hainan Island,
      and united many patriotic farmers through gradual "land reform".
    Expanded the armed forces,
      strengthened the organization,
    Chiang Kai-shek despised it,
      before and after,
    many battlefields,
      one-sided defeat.
    Hateful and laughable;
    American imperialism was bitterly jealous of it,
      fruitlessly scheming,
    unintentionally confessing,
      please read the Acheson White Paper report of August 5, 1949.
    To this day,
      it has basically liberated all of the men, women, old, and young of the entire Chinese mainland.
    Chairman Mao,
      Commander-in-Chief Zhu,
    great!
      great!
      It is the guidance of correct policy,
      it is the inspiration of noble spirit.
　
           (VI)
　
    How does it resemble an army!
      Studying,
    drilling,
    sports and games,
      criticism and self-criticism,
      day after day,
    from morning to night,
    it's simply a group of school youths!
      It lives in paradise,
    it operates in the farmland,
      serving the common people,
    doing everything willingly.
    Who knows it is good at fighting,
      needless to say,
    it has already won the praise of the people of the world.
    Who knows it is also good at uniting,
      uniting itself,
    also uniting the complex whole of China.
    Please look at the Northwest,
      how many brotherly nationalities,
    when the People's Liberation Army arrived,
      happily,
    like hands and feet,
    unrestrained.
　
       (VII)
　
    Eternally glorious "August First,"
      on this day in 1927,
    is the first dawn of its birth,
    from the ancient city of Nanchang,
      creating a new life for China.
    In these more than twenty years,
      its miracles are endless,
      its achievements are inexhaustible.
    It has simply turned over the great nation of 475 million people,
    and also encouraged many oppressed nations in the East,
      most recently, like the Korean people bravely defeating the American imperialist invading army,
    making the democratic bulwark of the Pacific people new,
      it will combine the power of the people of all countries,
      to defend world peace,
    the tranquility of mankind.
    Is it impossible for anyone to make more demands on it!
    Even if you make more harsh criticisms,
      only from the depths of my heart would I like to give it a title:
    "Holy Army"

　　圣军
    黄炎培
    一九五○年八一建军节献给朱总司令
           （一）
　
    自有人类，
      从没有发现过这样的军队，
    任何凶狠的敌人——
      蒋介石，陆海空，人员几百万，
    到它的面前，
      粉碎。
    任何现代化装备——
      美帝国主义，送给蒋介石，飞机、大炮、坦克，一批又一批，
    到它的面前，
      连人带械一齐来。
　
           （二）
　
    这算什么！
      尽管百战百胜，
    何尝觉得它可怕，
      只觉得它——
    可爱，
      可敬！
    每一个大城市，
      解放了，
    风雨中间站着，
      马路旁边躺着，
      连一杯白水送给它都不饮。
    老百姓涌上来了，
      争先地——
    欢迎它，
      拥抱它，
    难解难分。
      呀！
    它和老百姓怎么还可能“分”呢！
    它本身就是老百姓。
　
           （三）
　
    “起来！
    起来！
      不愿做奴隶的人们！”
    只有人民自己才能解放人民。
      中华一部近世史，
    清清楚楚地写着：
    “五四”是有组织的群众运动第一声；
      后来经过了多少尝试，
    吸取了多少经验；
    “八一”是中国共产党领导着的民众开始正式地武装起来，
      来发动革命战争。
      它又饱受了高度的长期的多少艰苦，
      这中间那里还数得清！
      莫忘！
    莫忘！
    二万五千里长征。
　
       （四）
　
    二万五千里，
      它从南方的五岭，
    向西绕一个大圈儿，
      来到了陕北长城。
    铁都打成钢了，
      看一阵阵落花流水般的追兵。
    从此，
      它深入了农村，
    怎样秋收？
      怎样春耕？
    尽量地吸收了切实而丰富的生活经验和政治经验，
      从艰苦中间获得了饱满的生命。
    靠天吗？
      靠人吗？
    不，
      不，
    自力更生！
　
           （五）
　
    八年抗日，
      它从高度的长期的艰苦中间壮大了。
    左一队游击，
      右一队游击，
    从黑龙江联接到了海南岛，
      还从逐步的“土改”中间，团结了爱国的农民不少。
    扩大的武装起来，
      加强的组织起来，
    蒋介石藐视它了，
      前前后后，
    多少战场，
      一面倒。
    可恨又可笑；
    美帝国主义毒忌它了，
      枉用了心机，
    不打自招，
      请读一九四九年八月五日艾奇逊白皮书的报道。
    到今朝，
      它在基本上已经解放了中华整个大陆的男女和老小。
    毛主席，
      朱总司令，
    伟大！
      伟大！
      是正确的方针指导，
      是崇高的精神感召。
　
           （六）
　
    那里像军队！
      学习，
    操练，
    运动和游戏，
      批评和检讨，
      一天又一天，
    从早起到夜眠，
    简直是一群学校青年！
      它生活在乐园，
    它操作在农田，
      替老百姓服务，
    什么都心甘。
    那知道它善于作战，
      不用说了，
    已经取得了全世界人民的称赞。
    那知道它还善于团结，
      团结了自己，
    还团结了复复杂杂的中华全国。
    请看西北，
      多少兄弟民族，
    人民解放军到了，
      快快乐乐，
    如手如足，
    无拘无束。
　
       （七）
　
    永远光荣着的“八一”，
      在一九二七年的今天，
    是它诞生的第一个清晨，
    从南昌的古城，
      创造了中华的新生。
    在这二十多年中间，
      说不尽它的奇迹，
      写不尽它的奇勋。
    它简直把四万万七千五百万人的大民族翻了身，
    还鼓励了东方许多被压迫民族，
      最近像朝鲜人民英勇地击溃了美帝侵略的军队，
    使得太平洋人民民主壁垒一新，
      它将组合了各国人民力量，
      来保卫到世界的和平，
    人类的安宁。
    任何人对它不可能提出更多的要求了么！
    尽让你们提出更苛刻的批评，
      只从我内心中间想给它一个题名：
    “圣军”
