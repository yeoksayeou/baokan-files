　　Youth Service Department Completes New Ball Field
    In order to assist in promoting sports activities in Beijing and establish connections with young people who love sports, the Youth Service Department has built a new basketball and volleyball court opposite the Beijing Hotel on East Chang'an Street. The venue is equipped with lighting for nighttime use and has now been completed and will soon be open to the public. Any teams from government agencies or organizations wishing to use the court, or hoping that the department will assist in organizing teams and providing coaching, can obtain the regulations at the department's court and complete the registration procedures in accordance with the regulations (the department's court telephone number is: 5-2416).
