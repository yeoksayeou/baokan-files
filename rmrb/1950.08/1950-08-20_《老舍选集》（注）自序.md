　　Preface to "Selected Works of Lao She" (Note)
　　Lao She
    In terms of the number of pieces, this collection only selects five old short stories to make the collection concise and incisive, meaning "rather eat a fresh peach than a basket of rotten apricots."

    In terms of genre, this collection only includes short stories, excluding plays, poems, and essays, because essays are written and published as they are produced, without keeping drafts or compiling printed copies; although plays and poems have been written, they are not very good, so they are abandoned. Popular literature began to be studied during the War of Resistance Against Japan, but this collection needs to select works from before the war, so it is also not considered.

    In terms of period, I no longer remember when these five pieces were written and completed, nor when and where they were published; I also do not fully remember which piece was written first and which was written later. My attitude towards writing is: I am always very attentive when I put pen to paper, and I am unwilling to be perfunctory; except in cases of force majeure (such as when a manuscript is urgently requested, or when I am not feeling well), I am unwilling to put out something that is too bad. However, once a work is published, it is like "a daughter who has been married off, water that has been poured out," and I no longer pay attention to them, so I easily forget their dates of birth. Generally speaking, these five pieces were all written between 1930 and 1937. That is to say, when I wrote these pieces, I already had some writing experience; my writing life began in 1924. Before writing "Black and White Li," I had already published four novels.

    In terms of technique, "Black and White Li" is not very mature, because it was produced when I was just beginning to learn how to write short stories—I had published several novels before I tried to write short stories. "The 断魂枪 (Duánhún Qiāng, "The Soul-Severing Spear")", "Taking Office," and "Crescent Moon" are all quite advanced in technique; "Crescent Moon" attempts to write a novel in the style of prose poetry. As for "骆驼祥子 (Luòtuo Xiángzi, "Rickshaw Boy")", there is no technique to speak of at all, but only a simple and unadorned narrative. Its advantage may lie in this: simplicity, conciseness, and strength.

    In terms of language, in these pieces, except for some deliberately embellished parts in "Crescent Moon," the rest strive to be restrained, to say little, to avoid flashy styles, and to reduce glibness as much as possible—glibness is a major flaw in my style. I am very good at using the Beijing dialect and expressing it in writing. However, strengths and weaknesses are often born of the same mother. I often forget to control myself because I am greedy for success and strive for wit, so I inevitably fall into being verbose, sarcastic, and glib. Around the age of forty, after reading a little more, the mischievousness of my youth gradually diminished, and I began to realize that the beauty of language is not about being glib.

    In terms of content, four of these five works are about so-called underworld affairs: "Rickshaw Boy" is about rickshaw pullers, "Crescent Moon" is about prostitutes, "Taking Office" is about bandits, and "The Soul-Severing Spear" is about boxers. I myself come from a poor background, so I have deep sympathy for the suffering. Although my profession keeps me turning in the circles of intellectuals, my friends are not all professors and scholars. Boxers, singers, and rickshaw pullers are also my friends. When I interact with the suffering, I don't just sit with them in teahouses and secretly record their actions and conversations in notebooks. I have never done such a thing. On the contrary, when I interact with them, I don't have the "deliberate" intention of observing anything, but just want to make friends. They help me, and I help them; they come to celebrate my birthday, and I go to congratulate them when they have babies or get married. In this way, I understand their mentality, and not just their living conditions. What I write is not any one of them, but a new thing or a new person produced from them, through my imagination and organization. For example, many of my friends are professional boxers: Tai Chi, Xingyi, Chaquan, and Puhu styles. However, none of them are like the boxers in "The Soul-Severing Spear," and there is no such story at all. The people and events in it are what I have washed out, processed, and concocted from many boxer friends.

    Here, I would like to add that the material for "The Soul-Severing Spear" was originally enough to write a novel, but because the manuscript was urgently requested, I abandoned the original plan and wrote a short story instead. I believe that this short story, although so short, may be more brilliant than a novel. When writing a novel, I think that it is not to be feared that the filling is large and the crust is thin, but that it is empty and without substance. "Crescent Moon" was also adapted from a novel. It was originally called "Daming Lake" and had more than 100,000 words. During the "January 28th Incident," the Japanese invaders set fire and burned the Oriental Library, and the original manuscript of "Daming Lake" was also burned inside. The reason why I dared to boldly try to write "Crescent Moon" in an almost prose-poetic style was precisely because I was very familiar with the story and characters, having written about them once, so I could work on the words in a calm and unhurried manner.

    In terms of thought, what is expressed in my early works is the inspiration that arises, writing out a little bit of my own social experience. Where does the "inspiration" come from? It comes from the May Fourth Movement. Before the May Fourth Movement, although I was very young, my prose was learned from the Tongcheng School, and my poems were learned from Lu Fangweng and Wu Meicun. By the time of the May Fourth Movement, vernacular literature rose up, and I could not help but be overjoyed. If at that time, anyone who could write a few words wanted to become a writer, then I was one of them. I started secretly writing novels. I didn't think about submitting them, nor did I ever submit them. However, writing in vernacular, and putting new punctuation marks in the middle of the sentences, was such a joyful and interesting thing! Even a hundred Wu Meicuns could not stop me from trying to write new things! This狂悦 (kuángyuè, "mad joy") of literary liberation (replacing classical Chinese with vernacular) caused me and thousands upon thousands of young people to spend countless efforts and consume countless paper and pens at the time!

    This mad joy does not necessarily make people understand thoughts clearly. On the contrary, it may make people confused, sentimental, and intoxicated in a realm where everything is poetry, and yet it is not easy to grasp clear poetic lines. I was like that. I imagined that the moonlight might be blue, that stones have feelings, and yet I did not have the courage to write out the blue moon and the living stone. Since new poetry could not be mastered easily, sometimes I would recite "Li Sao" late at night.

    However, the May Fourth Movement was ultimately anti-imperialist and anti-feudal. No matter how crazy a young person is, wanting to pick the little moon on the edge of the sky, he will not completely forget the major events of the country. In addition, with the news of the Russian Revolution and the theories of Marxism that could be heard and seen at that time, he would not only not forget the major events of the country, but also not forget the world revolution. This great ideal and revelation negated that the moon is blue. Moreover, taking myself as an example, having grown up in a life of lack of food and clothing since childhood, always holding the view that "fate is so," now hearing the term class struggle, how could I not be moved?

    In 1924, I went to the Oriental College in London to teach Chinese, and I began to write novels. With the previous description, it is easy to guess what kind of novels I could write. On the one hand, in terms of language, I desperately used the convenience that the vernacular gave me, rushing headlong, regardless of control and choice. On the other hand, I wrote a little bit of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal meaning. I say "meaning," that is to say, I have not made efforts to systematically study revolutionary theory books, nor do I understand the actual methods of revolution. I only used a little bit of my own social experience, and the grievances accumulated in my heart since childhood, to resist the oppressive individuals or countries. "老张的哲学 (Lǎo Zhāng de Zhéxué, "The Philosophy of Old Zhang")" and "二马 (Èr Mǎ, "Mr. Ma and Son")" are enough to prove that I do have this "meaning."

    In 1930, I returned to China, and my thoughts had progressed slightly compared to when I stayed in Britain. On the way back, due to lack of travel expenses, I stayed in Singapore, a gathering place for races, for half a year. There, the thoughts of middle school students were even more advanced than mine. They grew up in a true colony and could not wait to kick the imperialists away with one foot. According to them, my works, even if they had a little bit of "meaning," were just playful writing, not scratching where it itches. This made me uneasy, and because of unease, I wanted to improve myself.

    Back in China, the literary debate had abandoned the revolution of literature, and advanced to the literature of revolution, equipped with theory, with the rise of Proletarian Literature in creation. I did not dare to easily talk about theory, so I continued to create without participating in the debate. However, I had a number in my heart regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the Proletarian Literature works at that time. I thought their direction was right, but the content and technique were not satisfactory. Back and forth, I began to try to write things like "Black and White Li." The reason why I chose "Black and White Li" this time was not because it was better than other short stories, but to illustrate how I was influenced by the theory of revolutionary literature.

    Looking at it today, "Black and White Li" is a ridiculous, even absurd work. However, at that time, it was indeed enough to prove that I had some changes in my thinking. Admittedly, in terms of content, I did not dare to describe how Bai Li joined the organization, how he guided the working masses, and how he led the struggle, but only used the legendary style to describe the death of Hei Li; however, I finally understood that Hei Li should die, and that dying that way was the most worthwhile. No matter what, I am always slightly stronger than those who slandered the advancing warriors at that time, saying that although they helped the rickshaw pullers rebel, they kicked the rickshaw pullers twice when they did not run fast. Moreover, the censorship of the text at that time also made me unwilling to describe things frankly, so as not to put on a "red hat" without participating in the revolution.

    By the time of "Taking Office" and "Crescent Moon," my attitude had changed from negatively negating Hei Li to positively describing the oppressed. In the predecessor of "Crescent Moon" ("Daming Lake"), I actually described a Communist Party member, who was the stepfather of the heroine of "Crescent Moon." Only Mr. Xu Diaofu has read the original manuscript of "Daming Lake," and I don't know if he still remembers this detail for me. Even so, I did not find a way out for the woman in "Crescent Moon," or the "heroes" in "Taking Office." I only spoke for them and described their good qualities. But I did not dare to say how they should revolt. Why? The first is that I saw that in the revolutionary literary works at that time, the content was often not substantial, the characters were not vivid, and there were many激烈的 (jīliè de, "intense") slogans, such as: several children picking coal cinders, picking coal cinders, suddenly shouted: We must make revolution. I didn't want to write like that either. The second is that I only vaguely knew a little revolutionary theory from books, and I did not dare to use this little theory to write about the actual revolution. Third, my little literary cultivation ultimately came from reading Western classical literature, so I always forgot to pay attention to various aspects such as characters, language, thought, structure, and scenery, and not to focus exclusively or偏 (piān, "biasedly") on thought. In this way, on the one hand, I was able to quite skillfully, in simple and easy-to-understand terms, use character language to cover up thought, so that the work could steal through the customs tax card of censorship, and on the other hand, my work, in thought, and in action arising from thought, lacked the enthusiasm and煽动力 (shāndònglì, "煽动力") that literature should have. This inevitably made those who could guess my true meaning lurking beneath the story feel unhappy, not satisfied, and mock me as "wanting to eat but afraid of burning my mouth"; those who could not see so deeply felt baffled. Therefore, I myself must admit: I am a good storyteller, but not a first-class novelist. My sentimentalism is more than active struggle, and my humor dilutes the sense of justice.

    "Rickshaw Boy," because it is a novel, is more explicit and detailed in both thought and description than "Taking Office" and "Crescent Moon." However, I still did not dare to call out revolution and touch the虎威 (hǔwēi, "power") of the censorship masters. I only said at the end of the whole story: "Decent, strong-willed, dreamy, selfish, individual, healthy, great, Xiangzi, I don’t know how many funerals he has accompanied people to; I don’t know when and where he will be buried himself, burying this degenerate, selfish, unfortunate, social病胎 (bìngtāi, "morbid fetus") product, the末路鬼 (mòlù guǐ, "doomed ghost") of individualism!" (These sentences were deleted along with a large section in the abridged version.) I called him "the 末路鬼 (mòlù guǐ, "doomed ghost") of individualism," but I was actually blaming myself for not daring to state clearly why he did not "rebel." Soon after "Xiangzi" was published, a worker questioned me: "If Xiangzi dies like that, what hope do we have?" I had no words to answer.

    The above is a simple self-examination that I made by taking the opportunity to print this selected collection. It is difficult for people to completely see themselves clearly, and whether what I said is right or wrong is still a problem. However, I do know that if there were no victory of the people's revolution, no clear instructions from Chairman Mao on literary work, this preface would not have been produced, because I would not have understood what self-examination is at all, and what to examine. I hope that I will not be lazy in the future, and continue to study and create, and create in the way that Chairman Mao has instructed.

              Beijing, June 1950.

　　《老舍选集》（注）自序
　　老舍
    论篇数，此集只选了旧作小说五篇，为是教集子短小精悍，也就是“愣吃鲜桃一口，不吃烂杏一筐”的意思。
    论体裁，这里只选了小说，而没选剧本，诗歌，与杂文，因为杂文随写随发表，向不留底稿，也不汇存印成之件；剧本与诗歌虽然写过，可都不高明，故放弃之。通俗文艺则在抗日战争中开始学习，而此集须选抗战以前的作品，所以也不去管它。
    论时期，这五篇都在何年何月写起与写成，和在何年何月在哪里发表，都已记不清楚；就是哪篇写成在前，哪篇在后，也记得不完全。我的写作的态度是：在下笔的时候，永远很用心，不肯敷衍了事；除万不得已（如在索稿太急，或身体不好等情形下），我不肯将太坏的东西拿出去。可是，作品一经发表，即似“嫁出的女儿，泼出的水”，我不再注意它们，所以很容易忘了它们的生年日月。大致的说，这五篇都是在一九三○年与一九三七年之间写成的。这就是说，写这几篇的时候，我已有了一些写作的经验；我的写作生活是由一九二四年开始的。在写《黑白李》之前，我已发表过四部长篇小说了。
    论技巧，《黑白李》是不很成熟的，因为它产生在我初学乍练写短篇小说的时候——我是先发表过几部长篇，而后才试写短篇的。《断魂枪》，《上任》，和《月牙儿》三篇，技巧都相当的有些进步；《月牙儿》是有以散文诗写小说的企图的。至于《骆驼祥子》，则根本谈不上什么技巧，而只是朴实的叙述。它的好处也许就在此：朴素，简劲有力。
    论语言，在这几篇里，除了《月牙儿》有些故意修饰的地方，其余的都力求收敛，不多说，不要花样，尽可能的减少油腔滑调——油腔滑调是我的风格的一大毛病。我很会运用北京的方言，发为文章。可是，长处与短处往往是一母所生。我时常因为贪功，力求俏皮，而忘了控制，以至必不可免的落入贫嘴恶舌，油腔滑调。到四十岁左右，读书稍多，青年时期的淘气劲儿也渐减，始知语言之美并不是耍贫嘴。
    论内容，这五篇作品中，倒有四篇是讲所谓江湖上的事的：《骆驼祥子》是讲洋车夫的，《月牙儿》是讲暗娼的，《上任》是讲强盗的，《断魂枪》是讲拳师的。我自己是寒苦出身，所以对苦人有很深的同情。我的职业虽使我老在知识分子的圈子里转，可是我的朋友并不都是教授与学者。打拳的，卖唱的，洋车夫，也是我的朋友。与苦人们来往，我并不只和他们坐坐茶馆，偷偷的把他们的动作与谈论用小本儿记下来。我没作过那样的事。反之，在我与他们来往的时候，我并没有“处心积虑”的要观察什么的念头，而只是要交朋友。他们帮我的忙，我也帮他们的忙；他们来给我祝寿，我也去给他们贺喜，当他们生娃娃或娶媳妇的时节。这样，我理会了他们的心态，而不是仅仅知道了他们的生活状况。我所写的并不是他们里的任何一位，而是从他们之中，通过我的想像与组织，产生的某一件新事或某一个新人。举个例说：在我的朋友里，有许多是职业的拳师：太极门的，形意门的，查拳门的，扑虎门的，都有。但是，他们没有一位像《断魂枪》中的那几位拳师的，而且也根本没有那么个故事。其中的人与事是我自己由多少位拳师朋友里淘洗出来，加工加料炮制成的。
    在这里附带的说：《断魂枪》的材料原本够写一部长篇的，因索稿火急，就放弃了原来计划，而写成了一个短篇。我相信，这个短篇，虽然那么短，或者要比一部长篇更精彩一些。写小说，我以为，不怕馅大皮薄，而怕空洞无物。《月牙儿》那篇，也是长篇改造的。它原名《大明湖》，有十几万字。“一二·八”，日寇放火，烧了东方图书馆，《大明湖》原稿也烧在里面。我之所以敢大胆的试用近似散文诗的笔法写《月牙儿》者，正因为我对故事人物因已写过一遍而非常的熟习，可以从容不迫的在文字上多下工夫。
    论思想，在我的初期的作品里所表现的是兴之所至，写出我自己的一点点社会经验。兴之所至的“兴”从何而来呢？是来自五四运动。在五四运动以前，我虽然很年轻，可是我的散文是学桐城派，我的诗是学陆放翁与吴梅村。到了五四运动时期，白话文学兴起，我不由的狂喜。假若那时候，凡能写几个字的都想一跃而成为文学家，我就也是一个。我开始偷偷的写小说。我并没想去投稿，也没投过稿。可是，用白话写，而且字句中间要放上新的标点符号，那是多么痛快有趣的事啊！再有一百个吴梅村，也拦不住我去试写新东西！这文字解放（以白话代文言）的狂悦，在当时，使我与千千万万的青年不知花费了多少心血，消耗了多少纸笔！
    这种狂悦可并不一定使人搞清楚思想。反之，它倒许令人迷惘，伤感，沉醉在一种什么地方都是诗，而又不易捉摸到明朗的诗句的境界。我就是那样。我想像着月色可能是蓝的，石头是有感觉的，而又没有胆子把蓝月与活石写出来。新诗既不能得心应手，有时候我就在深夜朗读《离骚》。
    不过，五四运动到底是反帝反封建的。不管一个青年怎样的发疯，要去摘天边的小月，他也不会完全忘记了国家大事。再加上那时节所能听到的见到的俄国大革命的消息，与马克思学说，他就不单忘不了国家大事，而且也忘不了世界革命。这个伟大的理想与启示否定了月亮是蓝的。况且，拿我自己来说，自幼儿过惯了缺吃少穿的生活，一向是守着“命该如此”的看法，现在也听到阶级斗争这一名词，怎能不动心呢？
    一九二四年到伦敦的东方学院去教华文，我开始写小说。有了前边的一点叙述，我能写出什么样子的小说是很容易猜测到的。一方面，在文字上，我拚命的利用白话所给我的便利，横冲直撞，哪管什么控制与选择。另一方面，我多少写出点反帝反封建的意思来。我说“意思”，那就是说我并没能下工夫有系统的研读革命理论的书籍，也不明白革命的实际方法。我只借着自己一点点社会经验，和心中自幼儿积累下的委屈，反抗那压迫人的个人或国家。《老张的哲学》与《二马》都足以证明我确有这点“意思”。
    一九三○年回国，思想在比留英的时候稍稍进步了些。在归途中，因缺少旅费，在人种汇聚的新嘉坡住了半年。在那里，中学生的思想却比我还前进。他们生长在真正的殖民地，恨不能马上把帝国主义者一脚踢了走。据他们看，我的作品，即使有那么一点“意思”，都是游戏笔墨，未曾搔到痒处。这使我不安，因不安而想改进自己。
    回到国内，文艺论战已放弃文学的革命，进而为革命的文学，配备着理论，在创造上有普罗文学的兴起。我是不敢轻易谈理论的，所以还继续创作，没有参加论战。可是，对当时的普罗文学作品的长短，我心中却有个数儿。我以为它们的方针是对的，而内容与技巧都未尽满人意。一来二去，我开始试写《黑白李》那样的东西。我之所以这次选用《黑白李》者，并非因它比别的短篇好，而是拿它来说明我怎么受了革命文学理论的影响。
    在今天看起来，《黑白李》是篇可笑的，甚至于是荒唐的作品。可是，在当时，那确足以证明我在思想上有了些变动。诚然，在内容上，我没敢形容白李怎样的加入组织，怎样的指导劳苦大众，和怎样的去领导斗争，而只用传奇的笔法，去描写黑李的死；可是，我到底看明白了，黑李该死，而且那么死最上算。不管怎么说吧，我总比当时那诬蔑前进的战士的人，说他们虽然帮助洋车夫造反，却在车夫跑得不快的时候踢他两脚的，稍微强一点了。而且，当时文字的检查也使我不愿露骨的形容，免得既未参加革命，而戴上一顶“红帽子”。
    到了《上任》与《月牙儿》，我的态度已由消极的否定黑李，改为积极的描写受压迫的人了。在《月牙儿》的前身（《大明湖》）里，我居然描写了一位共产党员，他是《月牙儿》的女主角的继父。《大明湖》原稿只有徐调孚先生看过，不知他还替我记得此节否。虽然如此，我却没给《月牙儿》中的女人，或《上任》中的“英雄”们，找到出路。我只代他们伸冤诉苦，也描写了他们的好品质。可是我没敢说他们应当如何革命。为什么呢？第一是，我看见在当时的革命文学作品里，往往内容并不充实，人物并不生动，而有不少激烈的口号，像：几个检煤核的孩子，检着检着煤核儿，便忽然喊起：我们必须革命。我不愿也这么写。第二是，我只模糊的由书本上知道一点革命的理论，不敢用这一点理论去写革命的实际。第三，我的一点文艺修养到底是来自读阅西洋古典文学，所以我总忘不了重视人物，语言，思想，结构，写景等各方面，而不专注意或偏思想。这样，我在一方面，能够相当巧妙的，深入浅出的，用人物语言等掩护思想，使作品偷渡过检查的税卡子，在另一方面，我的作品，在思想上，和在由思想而发生的行动上，便缺乏了积极性，与文艺应有的煽动力。这必不可免的使能猜透我的潜伏在故事下面的真义的人觉得不痛快，不过瘾，讥我为“要吃又怕烫嘴”；使看不到这么深的人觉得莫名其妙。因此，我自己也必须承认：我是个善于说故事的，而不是个第一流的小说家。我的温情主义多于积极的斗争，我的幽默冲淡了正义感。
    《骆驼祥子》，因为是长篇，又比《上任》与《月牙儿》，无论在思想上与描写上，都更明确细致了些。可是，我到底还是不敢高呼革命，去碰一碰检查老爷们的虎威。我只在全部故事的末尾说出：“体面的，要强的，好梦想的，利己的，个人的，健壮的，伟大的，祥子，不知陪着人家送了多少回殡；不知道何时何地会埋起他自己来，埋起这堕落的，自私的，不幸的，社会病胎里的产儿，个人主义的末路鬼！”（这几句在节录本中，随着被删的一大段删去。）我管他叫作《个人主义的末路鬼》，其实正是责备我自己不敢明言他为什么不“造反”。在“祥子”刚发表后，就有工人质问我：“祥子若是那样的死去，我们还有什么希望呢？”我无言答对。
    以上，是我乘印行这本选集的机会，作个简单的自我检讨。人是很难完全看清楚自己的，我说的对与不对，还成问题。不过，我的确知道，假若没有人民革命的胜利，没有毛主席对文艺工作的明确的指示，这篇序便无从产生，因为我根本就不会懂什么叫自我检讨，与检讨什么。我希望，以后我还不偷懒，还继续学习创作，按照毛主席所指示的那么去创作。
              于北京，一九五○年六月。
