　　Hoping the People's Hospital Will Continue Its Efforts
　　The North China People's Hospital has accepted the criticisms of this newspaper's readers and has now begun to actively improve its work, achieving initial results. This is a good phenomenon. This matter shows that as long as we can humbly accept the opinions of the masses, we can do a better job with the existing manpower and material resources. However, as the hospital itself said, this is only the beginning of the transformation. It will take great effort to achieve comprehensive and thorough improvement. First of all, the hospital staff must truly understand the ideology, must recognize that criticism and self-criticism are powerful weapons for revolutionary workers to overcome shortcomings and improve their work, and must never regard criticism as an attack. Only in this way can they truly accept criticism and consciously and continuously overcome shortcomings in ideology and work, and consolidate the achievements already made. The North China People's Hospital is a hospital directly under the leadership of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government and should become a model for other hospitals. The responsibility of the hospital staff is significant. They should demonstrate a high degree of responsibility in their daily work of serving patients, living up to the expectations of the government and the people.
　　In order to ensure that some of the newly established systems are maintained and consolidated for a long time, it is hoped that the hospital will gradually establish other necessary systems, such as reasonable performance appraisal systems and reward and punishment systems, and frequently conduct criticism and self-criticism to ensure the continuous progress of work, so that the existing manpower and material resources of the hospital can play a greater role.

　　望人民医院继续努力
    华北人民医院接受了本报读者的批评，现已开始积极改进工作，取得初步成绩。这是好现象。这件事说明：只要能虚心接受群众意见，就能以现有的人力物力把工作做得更好。但正如该院自己所说，这只是转变的开端。要求得全面与彻底的改进，还须经过很大的努力。首先，该院工作人员一定要真正搞通思想，一定要认识批评与自我批评是革命工作者克服缺点、改进工作的有力武器，绝不能把批评看成攻击。这样才能真正接受批评，才能自觉地不断克服思想上和工作上的缺点，巩固已经获得的成绩。华北人民医院是中央人民政府卫生部直接领导下的医院，应该成为其他医院的模范。该院工作人员的责任是重大的。应该在日常为病人服务的工作中表现高度负责精神，以副政府和人民的期望。
    为了使刚刚建立起来的一些制度长期坚持下去，巩固起来，希望该院逐步建立其他必要的制度，如合理的考绩制度与奖惩制度等，经常进行批评与自我批评，以保证工作的不断进步，使该院现有的人力、物力能发挥更大的作用。
