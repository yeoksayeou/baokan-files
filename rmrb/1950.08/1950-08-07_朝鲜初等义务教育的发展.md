The Development of Primary Compulsory Education in Korea

Bai Nanyun, Minister of Education of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

In the northern part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, comprehensive primary compulsory education has been implemented since 1950. This plan has realized the long-cherished wish of the Korean people.

The Japanese imperialists, who had long ruled Korea, implemented a policy of enslavement in national education. In order to maintain their colonial rule, they completely deprived the Korean people's children of the opportunity to receive advanced general and specialized education. Instead of educating the Korean people's children with educated people, they consistently implemented a policy of keeping the people ignorant, leaving the Korean people in a state of illiteracy. As a result, many Koreans could not even obtain primary education, and nine-tenths of the entire Korean population were illiterate.

A very small number of Korean youths completed primary education, but secondary education was merely an unattainable dream for the children of the working people.

Before liberation, in 1944, in the only boys' secondary school in Pyongyang that was allowed to admit Koreans, there were 971 students, but not one of them came from a worker's or poor peasant's family. Nine percent were the children of landlords and capitalists, 47 percent were the children of merchants, and the rest were the children of people serving in Japanese institutions.

For 30 million Korean residents, there was only one university in Seoul (called "Imperial" University) and three poorly equipped specialized schools in the north. But even these few "higher education" institutions located on Korean soil were difficult for the Korean people, especially the Korean working people, to access.

In schools, the Korean people's native language was forbidden: all courses were taught entirely in Japanese. Korean history was not allowed to be studied at all, but a kind of Japanese history was taught that was based on anti-scientific materials and instilled ideas of aggression.

Students would be slapped in the face for accidentally saying a word in Korean. If a student was caught reading progressive books, they would be sent to the police station jail.

During Japan's aggressive wars, the Japanese did not set up regular courses in schools, but instead used students to collect scrap iron to build military airfields.

The discrimination against Koreans in the early stages of Japanese occupation had always been a characteristic of Japanese education policy. For example, in 1912, there were 199 government-run schools for Japanese people in Korea, and 95 percent of all Japanese children of school age attended these schools. However, there were only 341 schools for Korean children, and they could only accommodate 41,000 students, which was less than 10 percent of all children of school age.

For example, at that time, the only Pyongyang Medical "Specialized School" in northern Korea had only 313 students, of whom 62 percent were Japanese. At the "Imperial University," there were 422 Japanese students and 365 Korean students.

In our republic, the realization of universal education relies on a solid social and economic foundation.

Since the establishment of the people's regime, all schools have been transferred to the hands of the people, and many new school buildings have been restored.

The curriculum in schools is taught in Korean, and its content is in line with the interests of the people.

The National Education Department of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea announced the temporary program for the democratization of education for the Korean people in November 1945. On February 3, 1946, when the North Korean People's Committee was founded, Committee Chairman Kim Il-sung said in his report on the government program:

"One of the most important tasks in transforming national education in accordance with democratic reforms is to widely build new schools and rebuild school education based on democratic principles. The years of Japanese ideological rule and the suppression of our native language and Korean culture by the Japanese imperialists have left deep ulcers in the consciousness of our people. Thoroughly shattering Japanese aggressive ideology morally and politically and eradicating its remnants requires vigorous work in reforming the national education system."

In this speech, the basic principles of national education were determined. These principles were later included in the political program announced in March 1946.

By the end of 1946, the old national education system had been eliminated, and an advanced democratic system had been implemented.

With the reform of the school system, adult schools were established, giving the broad masses of the people the possibility of eliminating their illiteracy. After the foundation for comprehensive primary compulsory education was laid, the problem of training technicians and leading cadres arose.

The new school system in Korea consists of the following links:

(1) Primary school - five years. By eliminating Japanese anti-scientific content from the old education program and establishing the overall education system on a scientific track, the level of the new Korean primary school is clearly higher than that of the former Japanese six-year school.

(2) Three years of junior high school and three years of senior high school, a complete secondary education for six years. This system ensures a high level of secondary education.

In addition, a network of specialized schools with three to four-year courses has also been established.

(3) Korean youth receive higher education in higher specialized schools, from two-year normal schools to five-year universities, and graduate students have the possibility of studying abroad at public expense.

Currently, more than 100,000 young men and women are studying in middle schools, specialized schools, and higher specialized schools. More than 90 percent of them are the children of workers.

The children of office workers, farmers, and workers who once suffered from the double or triple exploitation of the domestic bourgeoisie and Japanese capitalists can now freely study advanced science and technology and use their knowledge and talents to serve the people.

The state gives great attention to creating suitable learning conditions for the children of workers in schools. Schools are equipped with dormitories. All students are guaranteed a standard supply of food; not only are children from low-income parents exempt from fees, but huge amounts of public funds are spent to enable young people to receive education in higher education institutions. The number of students receiving state scholarships has reached tens of thousands.

The content of education has been fundamentally reformed. Now the content of education is closely linked to the lives of the people and is in line with their true interests.

In schools at all levels, the main content of the curriculum is to educate new people in the spirit of internationalism and love for the motherland.

Adults in North Korea who did not have the opportunity to be educated in the past can now not only eliminate their illiteracy, but also receive secondary and specialized education in many adult schools. In addition, a specialized study system is implemented in all enterprises without leaving production; the number of training classes that train various specialized technical cadres is constantly increasing. A clear path has been opened for working youth to improve their qualifications. The correspondence education system is of great significance in improving the knowledge level of the broad masses. This correspondence education system is growing and developing every year.

Before liberation, Korea had a total of 1,496 primary schools, middle schools, and specialized schools (including Japanese schools), accommodating 910,000 students. Now, in North Korea, there are 5,224 permanent schools, with more than 2 million students studying in them. In addition, in the 1,762 primary schools and 616 middle schools established for adults, in the technical training classes attached to factories, in correspondence schools and night universities, more than 1 million people are receiving education.

Therefore, in less than five years after liberation, in the northern part of our republic, the number of secondary schools has increased 23 times, and the number of middle school students has increased 23 times. The number of specialized schools has increased 23 times, and the number of students in them has increased 56 times. When Japan ruled northern Korea, there was not a single true higher specialized school; now there are 15 newly built higher education institutions, with more than 10,000 college students studying.

2.7 million illiterate people had basically eliminated their ignorance by March 1949.

As for primary education, now even in remote mountain settlements, there are primary schools set up for the children of workers. As of September 1, 1949, 93.4 percent of all children of school age were studying in schools.

Article 18 of the basic law of our republic says:

"Citizens of the republic have the right to education. Primary education is universal and compulsory. The state guarantees free education for the children of poor citizens."

Based on this situation, the republic's government program regarding national education announced the following:

"From 1950, implement comprehensive primary compulsory education. It is necessary to educate all children who have not yet received school education and to maximize the development of the secondary school network."

Relying on the enthusiasm of the people, 2,656 classrooms were newly built and 7,500 were renovated; student dormitories and teacher residences were newly built or renovated; and hundreds of thousands of desks, chairs, sports equipment, and stationery were prepared.

On the other hand, the work of teacher cadres necessary for the implementation of universal education has produced many new teachers from 14 normal specialized schools, 4 normal colleges, and 1 education college. In addition, many short-term training classes were organized to train specialized teachers.

The only reason why North Korea was able to implement comprehensive primary compulsory education is that a true people's regime was established, broad democratic reforms were implemented, and the national economic plan was gradually and victoriously completed.

### 朝鲜初等义务教育的发展

　　朝鲜初等义务教育的发展
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国教育部部长  白南云
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国北部，从一九五○年起，实施了全般初等义务教育。这个方案使朝鲜人民的宿愿实现了。
    长期统治过朝鲜的日本帝国主义者，在国民教育方面实行了奴役政策。他们为了维持殖民地的统治制度，完全剥夺了朝鲜人民的儿女们接受先进的普通的和专门的教育。他们不以受过教育的人来教育朝鲜人民的儿童，却一贯地执行着愚民政策，使朝鲜人民处在不学无术的状态中。因之，很多的朝鲜人民甚至不能获得初等教育，全朝鲜居民的十分之九都是文盲。
    极少部分的朝鲜青年完成了初等教育，但是中等教育对于劳动人民的孩子们不过是一个难以实现的空想而已。
    解放以前，即一九四四年，平壤城内，在准许收容朝鲜人的唯一的男子中等学校里，有九百七十一个学生，但是其中没有一个学生出自工人家庭或贫农家庭。百分之九是地主和资本家的孩子，百分之四十七是商人的子弟，其余是在日本机关中服务人员的孩子。
    三千万朝鲜居民只有一个在汉城的大学（名叫“帝国”大学）和北部的三个设备简陋的专门学校。但是就连这几个位于朝鲜土地上的“高等学校”，对朝鲜人民，尤其对朝鲜劳动人民来说，是难以接近的。
    在学校里，朝鲜人的祖国语言是被禁止的：全部课程完全采用日语。朝鲜史完全不许研究，可是教授着那一种以反科学的资料为根据并且灌输侵略思想的日本史。
    学生偶然说句朝鲜话，就会吃到耳光。如果某个学生读进步的书籍，被撞见了，那就会被送到警察局监狱里去。
    在日本进行侵略战争期间，日本人在学校里不设正规的课程，却利用学生们去收集废铁来修建军用机场。
    日本人在占领朝鲜的初期，对朝鲜人的歧视，一直成了日本教育政策中的特点。例如，一九一二年，在朝鲜为日本人而设的官立学校计有一百九十九所，全部达到学龄的日本孩子的百分之九十五在这些学校里上学。但是，为朝鲜儿童而设的学校只有三百四十一所，同时它们只能收容四万一千个学生，即占全部达到学龄儿童的百分之十弱。
    例如，当时在朝鲜北部唯一的平壤医学“专科”只有三百一十三个学生，而日本人占有百分之六十二。在“帝国大学”里，有四百二十二个日本学生和三百六十五个朝鲜学生。
    在我们共和国中全般教育的实现，是依靠巩固的社会和经济的基础的。
    自从人民政权建立以后，所有的学校都移交到人民的手里，许多新的学校建筑恢复了。
    学校中的课程采用朝鲜文，其内容都是符合于人民利益的。
    北朝鲜临时人民委员会国民教育部于一九四五年十一月，公布了朝鲜人民教育民主化的临时纲领。一九四六年二月三日在创立北朝鲜人民委员会的时候，委员会主席金日成在关于政府纲领的报告中说：
    “依照民主改革来改造国民教育的最重要任务之一，就是广泛地建设新学校，同时依据民主原则重建学校教育。日本思想多年来的统治，日本帝国主义者对我们祖国语言和朝鲜文化的压制，在我们人民的意识中遗留下了深深的溃疡。在道德上和政治上彻底粉碎日本的侵略思想和根绝其残余的事业，在改革国民教育制度方面，需要大力的工作。”
    在这个演说中，国民教育的基本原则被确定了。这些原则后来列入了一九四六年三月所公布的政治纲领。
    一九四六年底，旧的国民教育制度已被铲除，先进的民主制度实现了。
    随着学校事业的改革，成年学校建设起来，使广大的人民群众获得了铲除自己文盲的可能性。全般的初等义务教育根基奠定以后，培养技术家和领导干部的问题随着发生了。
    朝鲜的新的学校制度是由下面的几个环节组成的。
    （一）初等学校——五年。从旧的教育纲领中铲除了日本反科学的内容，并把全盘教育事业建立在科学的轨道上，新朝鲜初等学校的水平，显然高于昔日日本的六年制学校的水平。
    （二）三年初中和三年高中，完全的中学教育为六年。这种制度保证着中等教育的高等水平。
    此外，三年——四年课程的专门学校网也建立起来。
    （三）朝鲜青年在高等专门学校中接受高等教育，从二年的师范学校开始，到五年大学为止，而且研究生有官费留学的可能。
    现在，青年男女十万人以上在中学、专门学校和高等专门学校读书。其中百分之九十以上是劳动者的子女。
    曾经蒙受过本国资产阶级和日本资本家二三重剥削的职员，农民和工人的子弟们，现在可以自由研究先进的科学和技术并能够使用自己的学识和才能服务于人民。
    国家对于给劳动者的孩子们在学校里创造适合于学习的条件，给予很大的关怀。学校附设寄宿舍。全体学生都保证有合乎标准的粮食供给；不仅对于低收入的父母的儿童，免收费用，而且支出巨额公费使青年在高等学校受教育。获得国家奖学金的学生数字，已达到了数万名。
    教育的内容，已实行了根本改革。现在教育的内容与人民生活紧密地联系着，符合于他们的真正利益。
    在各级学校中，课程的主要内容是以国际主义和对祖国的热爱的精神教育新人。
    过去没有得到受教育可能的北朝鲜的成人，现在不仅能够铲除自己的文盲，而且还在许多成人学校里得到了中等和专门教育。此外，在一切企业中，在不脱离生产的条件下都实行着专门学习制度；那些培养各种专门技术干部的训练班的数字在不断地增长着。在劳动青年的面前开辟了一条提高资格的坦途。函授教育制度，在提高广大群众知识水平方面具有很大意义。这种函授教育制度每年都在增长和发展着。
    解放前，朝鲜共有（日本学校在内）一千四百九十六个小学，中学和专门学校，收容学生九十一万人。现在，在北朝鲜，计有五千二百二十四所常设的学校，有二百多万学生在里面求学。除此以外，在为成年人设立的一千七百六十二所小学校和六百一十六所中学里，在工厂附设的技术训练班里，在函授学校和夜大学里，共有一百万以上的人受教育。
    因此，解放后还不到五年之中，在我们共和国北部，中等学校的数量增加了二十三倍，中学生的数目增加了二十三倍。专科学校增加了二十三倍，其中学生数目增加了五十六倍。在日本统治朝鲜北部的时候，没有一所真正的高等专门学校，现在已有十五所新建的高等学校，有一万以上的大学生在求学。
    二百七十万文盲到一九四九年三月已基本上铲除了自己的无知。
    至于初等教育，现在甚至在辽远的山地居民地点，也有为劳动者的孩子们设立的初等学校。至一九四九年九月一日，全部达到学龄儿童的百分之九十三点四都在学校求学。
    我们共和国基本法的第十八款说：
    “共和国的公民享有受教育的权利。初等教育为全般义务制。国家保障贫穷公民的子弟免费受教育。”
    基于这种情形，共和国政府纲领中关于国民教育方面公布如下：
    “从一九五○年起，实行全般的初等义务教育。必须使全部还没受学校教育的儿童受教育，以最大限度发展中等学校网”。
    依靠着人民的热情，又建造了二千六百五十六个和修缮了七千五百个教室；新建了或修缮学生宿舍和教师住宅；准备了数十万只书桌、椅子，运动器具和文具。
    另一方面，为实行全般教育所必需的教师干部的工作，从十四所师范专门学校，四所师范学院和一所教育学院中已造就出许多新教师。此外，为了培养专门训练的教师，组织了许多短期训练班。
    北朝鲜所以能够实行全般初等义务教育，其唯一的原因就是：真正的人民政权建立了，广泛的民主改革实现了，国民经济计划逐步胜利地完成了。
