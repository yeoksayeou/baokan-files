The Embarrassing Situation of the American Troops Invading Korea

　　Fighting Without Knowing Why
　　United Press staff correspondent Miller reported on the 6th: "What are we fighting for here? This is a question that exists in the American troops in Korea." Miller continued: "Chatting around the trenches of the Marine Corps (this is the newly reinforced American force), everyone discussed the same question in the lazy southwestern accents, Brooklyn slang, and New England twangs. The unanimous answer is: no one really knows. But one thing everyone agrees on: the sooner this chaotic situation ends, the sooner everyone can return home."
　　"We Are About to Retreat to the Ships"
　　In order to "shorten the front line" and concentrate forces, the U.S. military commander in Korea withdrew all U.S. troops and South Korean puppet troops under his command to the east bank of the Nakdong River from August 1st to 4th. Some American soldiers cried out pessimistically: "If we retreat twice more, we will have to retreat to the ships!" (Associated Press)
　　Fighting Each Other
　　According to Associated Press staff correspondent Lambert on the 5th: "Confused U.S. Marines exchanged fire with each other in the dark for six hours on Saturday (5th), and one Marine was killed by his comrades." Lambert said: The incident occurred far from the front line, possibly caused by a patrol mistaking the appearance of "Korean suspects." He said: "We heard a distant command: 'Stop!' Then, without asking for the password, they quickly fired four shots." Lambert said that in this incident, "the Marines fired almost several thousand rounds of ammunition."
　　Associated Press reporter Whitehead reported: At 7:00 a.m. on the 3rd, "enemy troops" suddenly appeared on a small hill behind the command post. Sleepy American soldiers grabbed their weapons and fired. Bullets pierced the thin walls of the building where the regimental headquarters was located, killing two officers and injuring several others.
　　U.S. Troops Retreat, Puppet Troops Cover the Rear
　　According to Associated Press correspondent Boyer on the Korean front: The work of U.S. troops withdrawing across the Nakdong River "was done wonderfully." The Americans let themselves cross the river first, while letting the Syngman Rhee puppet army cover the rear. The order was: U.S. logistics troops, U.S. front-line troops, then South Korean troops and local police forces. Boyer said: Among the latter, "many were afraid of being killed by the Communist army, so some of them discarded their uniforms and pistols and put on civilian clothes when they retreated as refugees," and crossed the river together.
　　Landmines Relocated
　　CBS broadcaster Martin reported on the 9th: Recently, incidents have occurred in the Korean U.S. military where heavy tanks were destroyed by their own anti-tank mines. The landmines had been buried in carefully selected locations, but were apparently dug up and relocated by infiltrating North Korean soldiers, so that American tanks were damaged when they touched them.

　　侵朝美军的狼狈相
    不知为何而战
    合众社随军记者密勒六日报道：“在这里打仗究竟是为了什么？这是在朝鲜的美国队伍里都存在的疑问”。密勒继写道：“在围于海军陆战队（这是美国新增援的部队）战壕的四周聊天时，大家用西南方的懒声懒调、布鲁克林的土腔和新英格兰的鼻音讨论着同一个问题。异口同声的回答是：没有人确实知道。但是有一件事是每个人都同意的：这种混乱的局面愈早结束，每个人就能愈早回国”。
    “我们就要退到船上去了”
    朝鲜美军司令为了“缩短战线”、集中兵力，而于八月一日至四日将其指挥的美军和朝鲜伪军，全部撤到洛东江东岸。有的美国兵悲观地叫起来说：“再退两次，我们就要退到船上去了！”（美联社）
    自己打自己
    据美联社随军记者兰伯特五日报道：“混乱的美国海军陆战队，星期六（五日）在黑暗中相互打了六小时的枪，一名海军陆战队人员被他的同志所击毙”。兰伯特说：出事地点离前线很远，可能系巡逻队误以为“朝鲜嫌疑分子”出现所引起。他说：“我们曾听到远处喝令：‘站住！’然后未问口令就很快打了四枪”。兰伯特说，在这次事件中，“海军陆战队差不多打了几千发子弹”。
    美联社记者怀特亥报道：三日晨七时，“敌军”忽然在指挥所后面的一个小丘上出现。睡眼惺忪的美国兵抓起枪械就打。子弹穿过团部所在地的房屋的薄墙，两个军官被打死，多人负伤。
    美军撤退，伪军殿后
    据美联社朝鲜前线记者包义尔说：美军撤过洛东江的工作“做得很妙”，美国人让自己先过江，而让李承晚伪军殿后。其次序是：美国后勤部队、美国前线部队，然后是南朝鲜军队和当地的警察部队。包义尔说：展后者中“有许多人害怕被共军打死，故有些当难民撤退过来时，丢掉他们的制服和手枪、穿上老百姓的衣服”，一齐过江。
    地雷移置
    美国哥伦比亚广播公司的广播员马丁九日报道：朝鲜美军最近发生重型坦克被自己的反坦克地雷炸毁的事件。地雷曾被埋在经过仔细选择的地方，但显然是被渗入的北朝鲜军掘出来，并移置在另外的地方，于是美国坦克触到它就被炸坏了。【新华社讯】
