Xinhua News Agency, 16th. (The news release of the National Hydroelectric Engineering Conference on the 14th is hereby revoked in full and replaced with the following:) The guiding principles and tasks for restoring and developing China's hydroelectric power industry have been decided by the National Hydroelectric Engineering Conference convened by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government from July 22nd to August 9th. The main content is that in the next three to five years, in order to meet the urgent needs of industrial, agricultural, and water conservancy construction, we will continue to complete projects that are already under construction and have economic value, and carry out new construction with a focus. At the same time, the Hydroelectric Engineering Conference has determined to provide technical assistance to local governments, cooperatives, or private enterprises in initiating small-scale hydroelectric projects; the central hydroelectric authorities will also establish rural small-scale hydroelectric demonstration plants. The conference also determined to systematically survey water resources, plan and design them, in preparation for the construction of larger-scale hydroelectric projects in the future. The conference also made decisions on issues related to the development of the hydroelectric power industry, such as training technical personnel for the hydroelectric power industry.

Note: China's hydropower resources are abundant, ranking second in the world, with a total storage of approximately 149 million kilowatts. Among them, the southwestern region accounts for 65.2 percent. However, the development of China's hydropower resources in the past was only 0.89 percent of the country's total storage. In the past year or so, thanks to the people's government's emphasis on the hydroelectric power industry, the restoration and new construction of hydroelectric projects in various places have achieved considerable results. For example, the remaining 200,000 cubic meters of concrete pouring project of the Fengman Hydropower Bureau dam in Northeast China completed 90,000 cubic meters last year and another 57,000 cubic meters this year before the flood season came, not only exceeding the original plan in quantity, but also of higher quality than during the Japanese occupation. In East China, the construction of several hydroelectric projects has also been completed or is about to be completed. After this Hydroelectric Engineering Conference, the construction of the national hydroelectric power industry will be developed more systematically and preparedly.

(Note: In the news released by the General News Agency on the 14th, the point that the initial focus of running small-scale hydroelectric projects was in the eastern foothills of the Taihang Mountains and the Jingwei River Valley in Shaanxi was wrong and should be deleted in full. In the sentence "For this reason, the Hydroelectric Engineering Conference has determined to assist local governments...", the word "For this reason" is inappropriate and should be changed to "At the same time."

### 水电工程会议决定方针  逐步建设全国水电事业

　　水电工程会议决定方针
    逐步建设全国水电事业
    【新华社十六日讯】（十四日发全国水电工程会议新闻，全文撤销，改发如下：）恢复和建设我国水力发电事业的方针与任务，已由中央人民政府燃料工业部七月二十二日至八月九日召开的全国水电工程会议作出决定。其主要内容是在今后三五年内，配合工业、农业和水利建设的急切需要，继续完成业已施工而富有经济价值的工程，并有重点地进行新建设。同时，水电工程会议已确定在技术上协助地方政府、合作社或私营企业倡办小型水电事业；中央水电主管部门并将创办农村小型水电示范厂。会议更确定有计划地勘测水力资源，加以规划和设计，为今后建设更大规模的水电工程作准备。关于与发展水电事业有关的培养水电事业的技术人员等问题，会议也作了决定。
    按：我国水力资源的丰富，居世界第二位，蕴藏总量约一亿四千九百万千瓦。其中西南地区占百分之六十五点二。但过去我国水力资源的开发，却仅及全国蕴藏量的百分之零点八九。一年多以来，由于人民政府对水力发电事业的重视，各地水电工程的恢复和新建工作已获相当成绩。如东北丰满水电局拦河坝剩余的二十万公方混凝土的浇制工程，去年完成了九万公方，今年又在洪水来临前完成了五万七千公方，不但数量上超过了原来的计划，质量也较日寇统治时为高。在华东地区，若干水电工程的修建也已经完成或即将完成。经过这次水电工程会议以后，全国水电工业的建设将更有计划有准备地逐步得到发展。
    （按十四日所发这一消息中，关于举办小型水电事业首期重点在太行山东麓和陕西泾渭河谷地区一点有误，应全删。“为此，水电工程会议已确定协助地方政府……”一句中，“为此”二字不妥，应改为“同时”。）（总社十四日所发消息，载本报十六日二版。——编者）
