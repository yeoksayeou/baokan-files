　　National Railway Warehouse Material Inventory Completed
    Extra Materials Worth Over 210 Billion Found, Laying the Foundation for People's Railway Material Management

    [Report from this newspaper] The national railway warehouse material inventory work, according to the instructions of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, under the direct leadership of the National Railway Warehouse Material Inventory and Allocation Committee, and after three months of efforts by railway employees and their families, was successfully completed by the end of June. The number of railway employees regularly participating in this work was 336,859, and the number of workdays for employees temporarily participating as spare-time labor and family members' voluntary labor was 292,489, saving the state 5 billion yuan in expenses. The materials collected by employees along the lines were worth 150.45847 billion yuan; enemy and puppet-regime materials unearthed from underground were worth 695.1 million yuan; and 68,026 tons of useful materials were recovered from waste materials, worth over 62.5 billion yuan. The total value of extra materials cleared out was 213.656966 billion yuan. This is a huge wealth that railway employees have added to the country by displaying a high degree of labor enthusiasm. This warehouse material inventory work has laid the foundation for the material management of the People's Railway.
    During this inventory process, many problems were found in past material management work.
    1. Discrepancies between materials and accounts: The material management work of the Tianjin Railway Bureau was relatively well-established in Guannei (inside the passes), but according to statistics, there were a total of 1,450 items of materials found to be in surplus, worth 41.99637137 billion yuan, accounting for 1.81% of all materials in the bureau. Among them, the Gui Sui Engineering Section had the largest surplus of materials, accounting for 55.66% of all materials in the section. There were a total of 4,725 items of materials found to be deficient, worth 1.246986 billion yuan, accounting for 0.54% of all materials in the bureau; among them, the Beijing Engineering Section had the largest deficit, accounting for 21.05% of all materials in the section. The total value of surplus railway equipment nationwide was 160.928417 billion yuan, and the total value of deficits was 25.896148 billion yuan. Judging from this surplus/deficit figure, it is clear that it would be impossible to establish a new material accounting system without this relatively thorough inventory.
    Irresponsible Material Storage Discovered, A Large Amount of Idle Material Cleared Out for Unified Allocation

    2. Unreasonable material storage: During the inventory, serious irresponsibility was found in material storage. Taking the Jinan Railway Bureau as an example: the Jinan Material Factory had dozens of horse-drawn carts in storage, which were damaged due to poor storage; electric motors were left in the open for too long, and even the tarpaulins had rotted; electric welding equipment rusted and deteriorated, making it unusable when sent to various units. The Fangzi Locomotive Depot had purple copper pipes and iron pipes placed outside the warehouse, while discarded sleepers were placed inside the warehouse. Similar phenomena existed in various bureaus. After this general inventory, the tendency of some material personnel to be consistently irresponsible for the storage of materials was initially corrected.

    3. Useful materials accounted for 1.42% of all railway materials cleared out from 80 years of accumulated railway waste. According to a report from the Taiyuan Bureau, 2,022.3 tons of usable old materials were recovered from 9,875 tons of waste materials, accounting for 20.66% of the bureau's total waste tonnage. This shows that thoroughly cleaning up waste materials is of great significance under conditions of financial difficulty.

    4. Idle material issue: The idle material cleared out by the Hengyang Bureau alone was worth over 422.167 million yuan, which can be allocated by the Finance Committee and the Ministry of Railways. By understanding the idle material situation of various bureaus, each bureau can mutually adjust surpluses and shortages, solving some material difficulties. In the past, because the situation was not clear enough, the Ministry of Railways and various bureaus failed to fully utilize the idle materials of various units. For example, the Shanghai Bureau once transferred 2,100 large-sized porcelain insulators from Nanchang to the Hangzhou Telegraph Section, but the section returned them to Nanchang because there were no suitable spikes. At that time, the Jinhua Material Factory had a large number of such spikes that were not needed. This greatly affected the work and wasted a lot of time and manpower.

    In the Future, It Is Necessary to Build Material Warehouses with Emphasis

    Establish a Material Management and Allocation System
    After this consolidation and inventory, the material situation of the national railways can basically be grasped. In order to do a good job in material management in the future, it is necessary to pay attention to solving the following problems: First, the issue of warehouse construction. 71.3% of the national railway materials are stored in the open air. In order to avoid losses, it is necessary to pay attention to building material warehouses with emphasis. Second, the issue of establishing a material management system. From this inventory, it was found that there are many unscientific phenomena in the material management and allocation systems, so it is necessary to improve business quality and establish a material responsibility system based on the experience of this inventory. Third, the issue of education for material management personnel. This inventory is a great practical education for material management personnel. In order to strengthen the sense of responsibility of material management personnel and do a good job, it is necessary to further strengthen political study. In addition, many comrades are active and responsible, but are not familiar with the business, so they cannot complete the work tasks. Therefore, holding short-term training classes is very necessary.

    The Mass Movement Formed by the Inventory Work Is the Reason for This Great Achievement
    This national railway material consolidation and inventory is an unprecedented large-scale movement on the railway. Not only did all employees pour into this movement, but their high enthusiasm also influenced many families in various regions to participate voluntarily. According to statistics from Liuzhou, the number of family members participating in voluntary labor reached a maximum of 448, accounting for 29% of the number of employees participating in voluntary labor at most. In many other areas, teachers and students from Rotary schools also used their spare time to voluntarily participate in voluntary labor, turning the inventory work into a mass movement.

    The reason why the inventory work of the national railway system has achieved great results is mainly due to the reliance on party, labor union, and youth league organizations at all levels to mobilize the masses, take the lead in guaranteeing, and jointly form warehouse inventory committees at all levels with administrative leaders to unify the leadership of the movement. However, the party, labor union, and youth league in some units did not pay attention to this work, and the inventory work was not done well.

    When organizing and mobilizing employees to carry out inventory work, several ideological obstacles were encountered: At the beginning of the inventory work, the Changsha Engineering Section believed that "inventory may record one merit, while road maintenance may record two demerits." The Zhuzhou Engineering Section believed that "other work is done well, but it cannot withstand a major accident on the line," as if doing inventory work would definitely affect road maintenance work. But this is not the case. Many units not only did a good job in inventory, but also stimulated the masses' production enthusiasm and promoted production through the material inventory movement. For example, in this inventory work, the Jinan Machinery Factory further relied on employees to complete the task, which greatly improved the employees' production enthusiasm. The workers said: "As long as all our employees unite together, any difficult task can be completed." The Taiyuan Machinery Factory could not start the machine because the tire of the steam hammer was damaged and could not be purchased for a while. This time, during the material inventory, six new tires of this type were found in the waste pile of the power plant, and the steam hammer was revived immediately. This is another example of the inventory work directly promoting production. In addition, some comrades believed that "there are few materials" and "not much material can be cleared out," so they did not pay attention to this work. However, the inventory results were contrary to the understanding of these comrades. Taiyuan is a unit with less material in stock. The value of five items, including waste recycling, underground excavation, material collection, employee donations, and off-book materials, is equal to 9.7% of the equipment before the warehouse inventory. Another common misconception is that "material inventory is the business of the material department and has nothing to do with other departments." They do not understand that such a large task cannot be done well by relying solely on the material department and temporary workers without relying on the strength of all employees, and temporary workers are not familiar with the business and cannot complete the task well according to standards.

    In this inventory movement, the responsible comrades of various administrative bureaus not only conducted the work in an organized and planned manner, but also many units took the lead in having cadres go deep into the site to inspect the work. For example, although the director and chief engineer of the Taiyuan Bureau were very old, they still had to go to the material factory every week to pick old materials and move splints, which had a great impact on promoting employee participation in voluntary labor. Deputy Director Li of the Shanghai Bureau personally organized this work and conducted in-depth inspections. The Tianjin Bureau and the Zhengzhou Bureau were able to use newspapers to guide the work in a timely manner. These played a great role in ensuring the successful completion of the inventory work.

　　全国铁路仓库物资清理完毕
    查出额外物资价值二千一百余亿  奠定人民铁道材料管理工作基础
    【本报讯】全国铁路仓库物资清理工作，根据中央人民政府政务院的指示，在全国铁路仓库物资清理调配委员会的直接领导下，经过铁路员工和家属三个月来的努力，已于六月底胜利完成。经常参加这一工作的铁路员工工数为三三六、八五九工，员工临时参加作为业余劳动与眷属义务劳动的工作日计二九二、四八九个，为国家节省了五十亿元的开支。员工们在沿线搜集的材料，价值一千五百零四亿五千八百四十七万元，从地下挖出敌伪埋藏的物资，价值六亿九千五百一十万元，从废料内检出有用材料六八、○二六吨，价值六百二十五亿余元，总共清理出额外物资的总价值为二千一百三十六亿五千六百九十六万六千元。这是铁路员工发挥了高度的劳动热忱，为国家增加了一笔巨大的财富。经过这次仓库物资清理工作，奠定了人民铁道材料管理的基础。
    在此次清理过程中，发现过去在材料管理工作上有很多问题。
    一、料账不符：天津路局的材料管理工作，在关内是比较有基础的，但据统计：全局点盈材料共有一、四五○项，价值四万一千九百九十六亿三千七百一十三万七千元，占该局全部材料的百分之一·八一。其中以归绥工务段点盈材料最多，占该段全部材料的百分之五五·六六。全局点亏材料共有四、七二五项，价值十二亿四千六百九十八万六千元，占该局全部材料的百分之○·五四；其中以北京工务段点亏数最多，占该段全部材料的百分之二一·○五。全国铁路器材点盈总值一千六百零九亿二千八百四十一万七千元，点亏总值二百五十八亿九千六百一十四万八千元。从这一盈亏数字来看，显然不经过这一次比较彻底的清理，要想建立新的料账制度是不可能的。
    发现过去材料保管不负责任  清出大量呆料可资统一调配
    二、材料保管不合理：在清理中发现过去在材料保管方面存在着严重不负责任的现象。以济南路局为例：济南材料厂存有马拉大车数十辆，因保管不良损坏；电动机搁置露天时间太长，连篷布都已腐烂；电焊锈损，发至各单位不能应用。坊子机务段紫铜管铁管置于库外，而废道木置于库内。这种类似现象各局均存在。经过这一次普遍清理，初步地纠正了一部分材料人员对于保管材料一贯不负责的倾向。
    三、从八十年来铁路积存的废料中，检出有用的材料占铁路全部清理材料的百分之一·四二。据太原局报告：在九、八七五吨废料内，检出能用旧料二、○二二·三吨，占该局废料总吨数百分之二○·六六。这说明了在财政困难的条件下，彻底清理废料是有很大意义的。
    四、呆料问题：这次仅衡阳局清出的呆料，价值四亿二千二百一十六万七千余元，可供财委与铁道部调配。由于了解了各局的呆料情况，各局之间可以互相调剂有无，解决一部分材料困难。过去因为掌握情况不够清楚，铁道部与各局均未能充分利用各单位呆料。例如上海局曾由南昌调拨二、一○○个大号磁瓶到杭州电务段，该段因无适合的穿钉，又退回南昌，而当时金华材料厂却存有很多这种穿钉用不着。这样使工作受到很大影响，且浪费了很多时间与人力。
    今后必须有重点的修建料库
    建立材料管理与调拨等制度
    全国铁路材料情况经过这次的整理与清点以后，基本上可以掌握了。今后为了要把材料管理工作做好，必须注意解决下面几个问题：第一，是仓库修建问题，全国铁路材料存放在露天中的共占总存量百分之七一·三。为了避免损失，必须注意有重点的修建料库。第二，建立材料管理制度问题，从这次清查中，发现在材料管理与调拨等制度上，有着许多不科学的现象，所以必须根据这次清理的经验，提高业务质量，建立材料负责制。第三，材料管理人员的教育问题，这一次清点对于材料管理人员是一个很大的实际教育，为了使得材料管理人员加强责任心，搞好工作，必须进一步加强政治学习。另外，有许多同志虽积极负责，但对业务不熟悉，以致不能完成工作任务。因之，举办短期训练班是十分必要的。
    清理工作形成群众性的运动是这次获得巨大成绩的原因
    这次全国铁路物资的整理与清点，在铁路上是史无前例的大规模的运动，不但全体员工涌进这一运动，而且由于他们的高度热情影响了各地区许多家属自动参加，仅据柳州地区的统计：眷属参加义务劳动的人数最高达四百四十八人，占员工参加义务劳动最多时人数的百分之二十九。还有许多地区扶轮学校师生利用课外时间，自动的参加义务劳动，使清理工作形成群众性的运动。
    全国铁路系统的清理工作所以获得巨大成绩，主要是由于依靠了党、工、团各级组织发动群众，带头保证，并与行政负责人共同组成各级清仓委员会，统一领导运动的进行。但有些单位的党、工、团没有重视这一工作，清理工作也就做得不好。
    在组织与发动职工进行清理工作时，曾遇到几种思想障碍：长沙工务段在清理工作开始时，认为“清点可能记一功，养路可能记两过”。株州工务段认为“其他工作作得好，经不起线路上发生一次大事故”，似乎觉得做了清点工作，就一定会影响了养路工作。但事实并不如此，好多单位不仅做好清点工作，而且通过物资清理运动更激励了群众生产情绪，推动了生产。如济南机厂在这次清点工作中，进一步依靠职工完成了任务，使职工生产情绪大大提高，工人们说：“只要我们全体职工团结一起，任何艰难任务都可以完成。”太原机厂因汽锤的轮带损坏，一时购买不到，使机器不能发动，此次清理器材，从动力所废堆内找出该项新轮带六条，即将汽锤复活了。这也是清理工作直接推动生产的又一实例。另外有一些同志认为“材料少”，“清理不出多少材料来”，因而不重视这一工作。但清理结果与这些同志认识相反，太原是存料较少的单位，仅废料翻身、地下挖出、材料搜集、员工献纳与账外材料五项的价值，即等于清库前的器材百分之九·七。再有一种普遍的错误思想，认为“清理材料是材料部门的事，与其他部门没关系”，不了解这样大的任务不依靠全体员工的力量，而单靠材料部门与临时工，是做不好的，并且临时工不熟悉业务，不能很好的按标准完成任务。
    各管理局的负责同志在这次清理运动中，不但做到有组织有计划的进行，而且有许多单位都作到干部带头，深入现场检查工作。如太原局局长、工务处长等虽然年纪都很大，每星期还要到材料厂挑旧料搬夹板，对推动职工参加义务劳动影响很大。上海局栗副局长亲自组织这一工作，并作深入检查。天津局、郑州局均能及时利用报纸指导工作。这些对保证清理工作的胜利完成，都起了很大的推动作用。
