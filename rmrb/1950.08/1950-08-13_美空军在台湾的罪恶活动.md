　　Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: Under the direct command of MacArthur, ground crew and mechanics of the U.S. invading army's Thirteenth Air Force have successively arrived in Taiwan. The commander of the force, Tenner, vainly hopes to stay in Taiwan for a long time and act as an accomplice in the slaughter of the Chinese people. The force's office in Taiwan was established on the 7th of this month. MacArthur's Chief of Staff, Fox, who arrived in Taiwan on the 4th of this month, has been busy meeting with bandit leaders in recent days to discuss "joint defense" matters. Several airports are now being expanded in Taiwan, and existing runways are being lengthened specifically for the take-off and landing of American jet aircraft and heavy bombers. To supply the U.S. Air Force with gasoline, the U.S. Navy oil tanker Cimarron, fully loaded with gasoline, also arrived in Keelung on the 6th. Recently, U.S.-Chiang planes have frequently conducted joint "patrols" of the Taiwan Strait.

　　美空军在台湾的罪恶活动
    【新华社十日讯】在麦克阿瑟直接指挥下，美国侵略军第十三航空队的地勤和机械人员，已相继抵达台湾。该队司令滕纳妄想长期留驻台湾，担任屠杀中国人民的帮凶，该队驻台的办公机构，已在本月七日成立。本月四日抵台的麦克阿瑟参谋长福克斯，连日忙与匪首聚会，商谈“联防”事宜。现台湾即将扩大数处机场，加长现有跑道，专供美国喷气式飞机和重轰炸机起落使用。为了供给美国空军的汽油，满载汽油的美国海军油船西马兰号亦于六日抵基隆。近日以来，美蒋飞机不时联合“巡逻”台湾海峡。
