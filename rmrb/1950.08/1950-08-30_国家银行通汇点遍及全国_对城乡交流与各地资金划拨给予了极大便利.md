The domestic remittance work of the National Bank across the country has made considerable and rapid progress over the past year or so. In terms of the establishment of the remittance network, remittance is generally possible in places where the People's Bank has been established. According to recent statistics, the People's Bank's institutions account for approximately 86.5% of the total number of counties and cities nationwide (excluding the Northeast). Among them, North China, except for Suiyuan, where it is not yet widespread, has almost all been established; East China and Central South China are also relatively dense; only Northwest China and Southwest China have fewer institutions due to later liberation and insufficient personnel preparation. Among these institutions, inter-provincial remittances can generally be handled, and there are also more than 1,100 remittance points with other provinces, accounting for 56.2% of the total number of counties and cities nationwide, including: 203 in North China, 407 in East China, 435 in Central South China, 47 in Northwest China, and 46 in Southwest China. In the national remittance network, the seven major cities are the main centers.

Due to the development of domestic remittance by the National Bank, it has greatly facilitated the promotion of material exchange and the allocation and clearing of funds in various aspects. According to recent statistics, the total amount remitted from the country in July (excluding the Northeast) increased by 473.2% compared to February of this year, and the total amount remitted in increased by 490.5% compared to February. Among the major administrative regions, East China had the largest remittance volume, followed by Central South China, and Southwest China was smaller. East China was more than four times larger than Northwest China. The percentage increase in remittances from major administrative regions in July compared to February is as follows: North China increased by 267.4%, East China by 510.3%, Central South China by 552.4%, Northwest China by 777.3%, and Southwest China by 648.5%. From this comparison, it can be seen that all regions have made great progress, especially Northwest China, which has increased the most.

The percentage increase in remittances from the seven major cities in June and July compared to February is as follows:
	 City			Beijing	Tianjin	Shanghai	Hankou	Guangzhou	Xi'an	Chongqing
	June			148	379	477	126	2,400		132
	July			160	374	493	217	2,346		298		279
		 Percentage increase

Among the seven major cities, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin are the fastest growing.

In terms of exchange rates, since the implementation of the "low-cost, multi-remittance" policy, they have gradually decreased to the point of being free. In June, the exchange rates in major administrative regions were generally between 1/1000 and 10/1000. Many major cities have free rates, such as Shanghai to Nanjing, Hangzhou, Tianjin, and Beijing; Guangzhou to Shanghai and Tianjin; Hankou to Tianjin, Chongqing, and Guangzhou. Only a few remote areas and areas with transportation difficulties have higher exchange rates. Most areas are very low.

To facilitate customers, cooperate with cash management, and improve work efficiency, various regions have made many improvements to the remittance business. For example, the Sunan and Shandong Provincial Branches in East China have successively handled "savings account appointment family remittances" (Note: This means that savings account holders make appointments with the bank to remit a fixed amount to their families on a regular basis, and the bank remits it when it is due, reducing the trouble for savings account holders.) to facilitate the family expenses of employees and savings account holders. If the Yancheng Sub-branch of Subei has remittances to government agencies, public enterprises, and private savings account holders, it actively deposits them on their behalf, which can save savings account holders the trouble of withdrawing money and can help them earn interest. For example, small family remittances of less than 200,000 yuan at the Yancheng Sub-branch are directly delivered to the recipients' homes by trainees, which is very convenient for remitters and recipients. In addition, the Nanjing Branch has a "mobile service team" that regularly goes to factories, schools, government agencies, and shopping malls to actively seek savings and remittance business.

　　国家银行通汇点遍及全国
    对城乡交流与各地资金划拨给予了极大便利
    【本报讯】全国各地国家银行的国内汇兑工作，一年多以来有着相当迅速的进展。在通汇网的建立上说，凡是设立了人民银行的地方，一般的都能通汇，根据最近统计：人民银行的机构约占全国县、市总数（东北在外）百分之八十六点五，其中华北区除绥远尚不普遍以外，几已全部设立；华东区、中南区也较密；只有西北区、西南区因解放较晚，人员筹措不及，机构较少。在这些机构中，省内互汇大都可以办理，与省外通汇，亦有一千一百余个通汇点，占全国县、市总数百分之五十六点二，包括：华北区二百零三个，华东区四百零七个，中南区四百三十五个，西北区四十七个，西南区四十六个。在全国汇兑网中，七大城市为主要中心。
    由于国家银行国内汇兑的发展，对促进物资交流及各方面调拨资金清算划拨上，给予了极大便利。根据最近的统计：七月份全国汇出总额（东北除外）较本年二月份增加了百分之四百七十三点二，汇入总额则较二月增加百分之四百九十点五。各大行政区中，以华东区汇兑额为最大，中南区次之，西南区较少，华东区比西北区多出四倍有余。七月份各大行政区汇出款项较二月增加之百分比如下：华北区增加百分之二百六十七点四，华东区百分之五百一十点三，中南区百分之五百五十二点四，西北区百分之七百七十七点三，西南区百分之六百四十八点五。从这个比较中可以看出，各区都有很大的发展，尤以西北区增加最多。
    以七大城市六、七月份汇出款项与二月比较增加百分比如下： 城市            北京   天津   上海    汉口   广州      西安
                 重庆较二月六月     一四八 三七九 四七七 一二六 二、四○○ 一三二
                 二九七增加百分比七月 一六○ 三七四 四九三 二一七 二、三四六 二九八
                 二七九
    七大城市中，广州、上海、天津三市是发展最快的。
    汇率方面：自“廉价多汇”的方针实施以来，即逐步降低以至免费。六月份各大行政区的汇率，一般的都在千分之一至千分之十之间。各主要城市间有很多是免费的，如上海对南京、杭州、天津、北京；广州对上海、天津；汉口对天津、重庆、广州等。只有少数偏远区及运现困难的地区汇率才较高。一般地区都是很低的。
    为便利顾客，配合现金管理，提高工作效率，各地对汇兑业务都有很多的改进。如华东区的苏南、山东省行先后办理“存户预约家用汇款”（按：即存户与银行预约，定期向家汇款数，到期即由银行汇去，减少存户麻烦。），以便利职工存户的赡家费用。苏北盐城支行对机关团体公营企业及私人存户如有汇入款项，即主动的代为存入，可免去存户取款的麻烦，且可以帮助他们得到利息。又如盐城支行凡二十万元以下之小额赡家汇款，直接由练习生携现送至收款人家中，对汇款收款人更十分方便。此外，南京分行有一“流动服务组”，经常流动到各工厂、学校、机关、商场，主动去争取存汇业务。
