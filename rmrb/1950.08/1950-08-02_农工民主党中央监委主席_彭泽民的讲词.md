Xinhua News Agency, August 1st: Speech by Peng Zeming, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, at the Beijing gathering of all circles celebrating the "August 1st" Army Day and opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea: Chairman, Comrades:

　　Today, as all circles celebrate the August 1st Army Day, I, on behalf of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, extend our highest respect and warm congratulations to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army.

　　"August 1st" and "July 1st" are the most glorious days for the Chinese people, and the most significant festivals in Chinese history, because without the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the Chinese people could not have achieved liberation and independence.

　　Now the People's Liberation Army has basically completed the combat tasks of liberating Chinese territory and overthrowing reactionary rule, but because Taiwan and Tibet remain to be liberated, and the threat of imperialist aggression wars has not been eliminated, our combat tasks are not yet complete.

　　Now, due to the growing strength of world peace forces, the success of the Chinese People's Revolution, and the victory of the Korean Liberation War, American imperialism is frantically carrying out military aggression against Korea and Taiwan, thereby intensifying our military tasks.

　　The characteristic of imperialism is aggression, is war. In the face of imperialism, there is no distinction between regions and nationalities. Therefore, we must regard the American aggression against Korea and Taiwan as a single action. Therefore, the victory of the Korean people is also the victory of the Chinese people, and we must be concerned about the Korean war and support them in every possible way.

　　American imperialism is essentially a paper tiger, and there is nothing to be afraid of. It is isolated, opposed by its own people, and even more opposed by the people of the world. We can see from the failures of the American military in South Korea that if it really launches a war of aggression, it will inevitably be quickly defeated by the power of the people of the world.

　　The Chinese People's Liberation Army is the peaceful armed force of the Chinese people, and the national defense force of China. If anyone dares to invade our territory and disrupt our peace, we will resolutely and mercilessly defeat them and eliminate them. Taiwan is the territory of the Chinese people, and we absolutely will not allow American imperialism to invade it. We must liberate Taiwan!

　　Compatriots: Liberating Taiwan is our final combat task, and one of the prerequisites for achieving a fundamental improvement in China's economic situation. We must, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, strengthen unity and strive to produce, in order to complete the preparatory work for the liberation of Taiwan.

　　Liberating Taiwan is an arduous task, requiring a sufficient air force and navy. Therefore, an important task currently facing us is to establish a complete and modernized national defense force. Today, as we commemorate "August 1st," the people of our entire country must work together to complete this task.

　　Finally, we shout:

　　Long live the success of the "August 1st" Army Day!

　　Long live the People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live the great unity of the Chinese people!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live Chairman Mao!

　　Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

　　农工民主党中央监委主席
    彭泽民的讲词
    【新华社一日讯】中国农工民主党中央监察委员会主席彭泽民在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的讲词：主席，各位同志：
    今天各界庆祝八一建军节日，我代表中国农工民主党首先向毛主席、朱总司令和人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员致崇高的敬礼和热烈的祝贺。
    “八一”和“七一”这两天是中国人民最感光荣的日子，是中国历史上最有意义的节日，因为如果没有中国共产党和中国人民解放军，中国人民是不可能得到解放和独立的。
    现在人民解放军已经基本上完成了解放中国领土和推翻反动统治的战斗任务，但是由于台湾、西藏还待解放，帝国主义侵略战争的威胁还未解除，因此，我们的战斗任务还是没有完毕的。
    现在美帝国主义，由于世界和平力量的日益壮大，由于中国人民革命成功，由于朝鲜解放战争的胜利，正在疯狂地对朝鲜和台湾进行军事侵略，因此也就加重了我们的军事任务。
    帝国主义的特性就是侵略，就是战争。在帝国主义的面前，是没有地区和民族的分别的。因此，我们必须把美帝对朝鲜和台湾的侵略看成为一个行动。因此，朝鲜人民的胜利也就是中国人民的胜利，而我们也就必须关切朝鲜的战事，必须用各种方法来声援他们。
    美帝国主义本来就是一个纸老虎，没有什么可怕的地方。他是孤立的，国内人民反对它，全世界人民更反对它。我们看到美帝在南朝鲜作战的失败情况，就可以断定它如果真要发动侵略的世界大战，它必定很快地就被全世界的人民的力量所击败。
    中国人民解放军是中国人民的和平武装力量，是中国的国防军。如果谁敢侵略我们的领土，破坏我们的和平，我们就要坚决无情的打倒他，消灭他。台湾是中国人民的领土，我们是绝对不容许美帝侵略的，我们一定要解放台湾！
    同胞们：解放台湾是我们最后的战斗任务，是争取中国经济情况基本好转的前提条件之一，我们必须在中国共产党领导之下，加强团结，努力生产，以完成解放台湾的准备工作。
    解放台湾是一个艰巨的任务，必须有足够的空军和海军。因此摆在我们当前的一件重要工作，就是建立完整的、现代化的国防军。今天我们纪念“八一”，我们全国人民就要共同努力来完成这个任务。
    最后我们高呼：
    “八一”建军成功万岁！
    人民解放军万岁！
    中国人民大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    朱总司令万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
