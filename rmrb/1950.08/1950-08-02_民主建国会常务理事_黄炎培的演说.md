Xinhua News Agency, August 1st—Speech by Huang Yanpei, Standing Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, at the Beijing gathering celebrating "August 1st" Army Day and the demonstration against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea:

　　"August 1st" is a glorious anniversary. It is not only glorious for the Chinese people, but also for the people of the world.

　　"The characteristic and also the advantage of the Chinese revolution is that armed people oppose armed counter-revolution," is a famous saying of Marshal Stalin. The armed people he spoke of are precisely the brilliant Chinese People's Liberation Army, whose predecessor was the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army established on August 1, 1927.

　　Thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the brilliant command of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, this people's armed force with a high degree of political consciousness laid a solid foundation in smashing the enemy's five "encirclement and suppression" campaigns and carrying out the epic 25,000-li Long March. In resisting the frenzied attacks of the Japanese invaders' million-strong army, it gained a high degree of qualitative tempering and quantitative development. Finally, it was able to completely defeat the unprecedentedly powerful Chiang Kai-shek reactionary armed forces in China, which were strongly supported by American imperialism, enabling the world's largest Chinese nation to stand up.

　　This fact fully proves that although the revolutionary force is very small at the beginning, just a seedling, a spark, if it gains the support of the broad masses of the people, it will eventually grow stronger and achieve final victory. This characteristic and advantage of the Chinese revolution powerfully awakens the oppressed people of the world, recognizing that revolution must develop into armed struggle, and that the armed struggle of the people's revolution can ultimately be victorious.

　　The heroic achievements and excellent political work of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and its deep love for the people, have won the praise of the people all over the world. This characteristic of being good at fighting and good at uniting has become a major condition for victory in battle. At the same time, it is also good at production. During the era of being surrounded in northern Shaanxi, it created the miracle of self-sufficiency in production. Today, in addition to taking on the task of liberating Taiwan and Tibet, consolidating national defense, and eliminating the remaining reactionary forces, it is also working hard to restore construction, increase production, and reduce national expenditures. Could anyone possibly ask more of it? With such a people's army, we have achieved victory and have a solid guarantee of victory.

　　The blows that the Korean People's Army has given to the armed aggression of American imperialism also prove one point: only when the people have mastered armed forces can they defend their own country; only when the people of all countries unite their strength can they defend world peace. The powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army not only protects its own new country today, but has also become a powerful pillar in defending world peace.

　　The powerful Korean People's Army will surely liberate the entire Korea and drive out the forces of American imperialism. The powerful Chinese People's Liberation Army will surely liberate Taiwan and completely destroy the armed intervention of American imperialism. Let us shout:

　　Down with the aggression of American imperialism!

　　Defend world peace!

　　Long live the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

　　Long live Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!

　　Long live the People's Republic of China!

    黄炎培的演说
    【新华社一日讯】民主建国会常务理事黄炎培在北京各界庆祝“八一”建军节反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜示威大会上的演说：
    “八一”是一个光荣的纪念日。不但是中国人民的光荣，而且是全世界人民的光荣。
    “中国革命的特点又是优点，是武装的人民反对武装的反革命”，这是斯大林大元帅的一句名言。他所说的武装的人民，正是光辉灿烂的中国人民解放军，它的前身便是一九二七年八月一日建立起来的中国工农红军。
    由于中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导，由于朱总司令的英明统率，这一支具有高度政治觉悟的人民武装队伍，在粉碎敌人的五次“围剿”，进行可歌可泣的二万五千里长征当中，奠定了坚强的基础，在抗击日寇百万大军的疯狂进攻当中，获得了高度的质的锻炼和量的发展，终于能够彻底击溃了由美帝国主义大力支援在中国空前强大的蒋介石反动武装，使得世界上最大的中华民族翻了身。
    这一个事实，充分证明了革命的力量尽管开始是很小的，一点点的幼苗，一星星的火种，但是它得到了广大人民的拥护，终于会壮大起来取得最后胜利的。这一中国革命的特点兼优点，有力地唤醒全世界被压迫的人民，认识革命必须发展到武装斗争，而人民革命的武装斗争是终久可以获得胜利的。
    中国人民解放军的英勇战绩，以及优良的政治工作，它对于人民的深切友爱，已经得到了全世界人民的称赞。这种善于战斗又善于团结的特点，已经成为作战胜利的主要条件。同时它还善于生产，在陕北被围时代，曾经创造了生产自给的奇迹；在今天它除了担当起解放台湾、西藏、巩固国防、肃清反动派残余势力以外，它还为了恢复建设，增加生产与节减国家支出而努力。任何人还可能对它有什么更多的要求吗？有了这样的人民军队，就使我们取得了胜利，就使胜利有了巩固的保障。
    朝鲜人民军给予美帝国主义武装侵略的打击，同样证明了一点，只有人民掌握了武装力量，才能保卫自己的国家，只有各国人民力量的团结，才能保卫世界的和平。强大的中国人民解放军，今天不但保卫着自己的新国家，而且已经成为保卫世界和平的有力的支柱了。
    强大的朝鲜人民军，必将解放全朝鲜，把美帝的势力驱逐出去。强大的中国人民解放军，必将解放台湾，彻底摧毁美帝的武装干涉。让我们高呼：
    打倒美国帝国主义的侵略！
    保卫世界和平！
    中国人民解放军万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席、朱总司令万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
