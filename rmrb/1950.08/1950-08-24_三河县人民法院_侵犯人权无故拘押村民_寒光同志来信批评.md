　　Comrade Hanguang Criticizes in Letter

　　Editor Comrade:
　　Here is an example of a court violating human rights. Please publish it to draw the attention of judicial workers. The course of events is as follows:
　　The land dispute between Wang Chaogui, Wang Chaoxuan, and Wang Chaolin of Yankou Village, Chengguan District, Sanhe County, was already judged by the Sanhe County People's Court this spring. At the end of July, the Sanhe County People's Court again sent Judge Jie Chunfeng to the village to understand the matter. After Comrade Jie arrived at the village, he asked Wang Chaoxuan and Wang Chaogui for their family division document. Wang Chaoxuan and Wang Chaogui refused because they did not know why they were being asked for it again. Comrade Jie became furious at the time and, without explaining to Wang Chaoxuan and others, said, "Don't think it's just asking for your family division document. If the court wants me to take you away, you all have to go." Wang Chaoxuan and others said righteously, "Then take us." Thereupon, Comrade Jie took Wang Chaoxuan and the other person to the court, and without asking right from wrong, put handcuffs on Wang Chaoxuan and others and detained them for five days and five nights without interrogation. Later, they were forced to admit that the family division document they presented was fake (according to the Public Security Bureau, the family division document was not fake). Wang Chaoxuan was forced to confess against his will. Later, the Sanhe County Public Security Bureau submitted an opinion to the court, stating that handcuffs should not be used in civil cases. However, the court actually believed that this case had been converted from a civil case to a criminal case. Although Wang Chaoxuan and others were eventually released, the matter has not been thoroughly resolved. The masses have a lot of opinions about this. We believe that the Sanhe County People's Court's work style of replacing policy with emotion has caused an event of violating human rights. This is a huge mistake. We hope that the court will conduct a review of this matter and correct this mistake in the future.

### 三河县人民法院  侵犯人权无故拘押村民  寒光同志来信批评

　　三河县人民法院
    侵犯人权无故拘押村民
    寒光同志来信批评编辑同志：
    这里发生了一件法院侵犯人权的例子，请你发表出来，以引起司法工作人员的注意。事情的经过是这样的：
    三河县城关区沿口村王朝贵、王朝选二人和王朝林的房基纠纷问题，今春已经三河县人民法院判决。七月底，三河县人民法院又派审判员解春风同志到该村去了解这一问题。解同志到该村后，就向王朝选、王朝贵二人要分家单。王朝选、王朝贵因为不知道为什么又要分家单，就拒绝了。解同志当时大发雷霆，也不向王朝选等解释，就说：“不要说只向你们要分家单，如果法院要我带你们走，你们都得走。”王朝选等理直气壮地说：“走就走。”于是，解同志竟将王朝选等二人带到法院，不问是非，就给王朝选等带上手铐，押了五天五夜，不加审讯。后来又强迫他们两人承认他们拿出来的分家单是假的（据公安局了解，分家单不是假的）。王朝选被迫，只得含屈供认。后来，三河县公安局向法院提出意见，说民事案件不应施用铐刑。但法院竟认为这一案件已由民事转为刑事案件。最后王朝选等虽然被释放，但事情并未得到彻底解决。群众对此很有意见。我们认为：三河县人民法院这种以感情代替政策的工作作风，造成了侵犯人权的事件。这是一个极大的错误。希望该院对这事进行检讨，并在今后改正这一错误。
