　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, August 17th: According to TASS, the US Congressional elections are now less than three months away. In this year's elections, one-third of the Senate seats and all of the House of Representatives seats will be up for re-election. In order to compete for the honor of implementing Wall Street's aggressive plans, the struggle between the US Democratic and Republican parties has intensified. On the 13th, Republican members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Hickenlooper, Lodge, Smith, and Wiley issued a joint statement, asserting that in the past five years, the Truman administration has not been active enough in the fight against "communism" -- especially in the Far East. The aforementioned statement blamed the setbacks of the US military in Korea on the State Department's Far East policy. The statement urged full support for the military aggression adventure in Korea, and stated that the Republican Party could more effectively realize Wall Street's plans than the Democratic Party.
    Democratic Senator Connally vehemently criticized the Republican Party's document on the 14th. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, in a conversation with reporters, declared that the Republicans had issued "a clear and blatant political statement obviously intended to influence the future elections." In responding to Republican criticisms of the government's foreign policy, Connally pointed out that Republicans, especially Dulles, participated in the decisions of all important issues. Democratic Senator McMahon also delivered a speech in the Senate, declaring that the Republican Party's statement was for election purposes.
    At the same time, the American Communist Party continues to expose these two major parties and intensifies its struggle for peace. The Progressive Party maintains similar views. Progressive Party Chairman and former Minnesota Governor Benson announced in a conversation with reporters that although Wallace had withdrawn from the Progressive Party, he would continue to serve in his position.

    美民主共和两党互相攻讦
    美共揭露两党竞选阴谋
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约十七日讯：现在离美国国会选举日期已不到三个月。在今年的选举中，参院将改选三分之一的议员，众院将改选全部的议员。为了争夺实行华尔街侵略计划的光荣，美国民主、共和两党之间的斗争已形加紧。十三日，参院外交委员会共和党委员希根鲁普、洛奇、史密斯和维利发表联合声明，断言在过去五年中杜鲁门政府在与“共产主义”斗争——特别是在远东——方面不够积极。上述声明将美军在朝鲜的挫折归咎于国务院的远东政策。声明敦促以全力支持在朝鲜的军事侵略冒险，并表示：共和党能够比民主党更有效地实现华尔街的计划。
    民主党参议员于十四日猛烈斥责共和党的文件。参院外委会主席康纳利在与新闻记者谈话时宣称，共和党人发表了《显然是打算用来影响未来选举的明白露骨的政治声明》。康纳利在答复共和党对政府外交政策的批评时指出，共和党人特别是杜勒斯，是参加了所有重要问题的决定的。民主党参议员麦克马洪也在参院发表演说，宣称共和党的声明是为了选举的目的。
    同时，美国共产党继续揭露这两个大党，并加紧为和平而斗争。进步党保持相似的意见。进步党主席、前明尼苏达州州长宾逊在与记者谈话时宣布，尽管华莱士退出了进步党，但他将继续担任他的职务。
