　　After Four Flood Tests and Careful Preparation
    Northern Jiangsu's Xinyi River Safely Passes the Fifth Major Flood
    [This newspaper reports] (Shanghai Liberation Daily, August 24th): Northern Jiangsu's Xinyi River has safely passed its fifth major flood this year, achieving an unprecedented victory in the history of water conservancy in Northern Jiangsu. Since July, the river has been tested by floods four times. Beginning on August 16th, heavy rains fell again in Shandong Province. On the 18th, the fifth highest flood peak flowed into the Xinyi River. On the 20th, the water level in Shuyang rose to 9.46 meters, with a measured flow rate of 2551 cubic meters per second. On the 21st, near Xiaochao River in Guanyun, the water level was only one meter from the top of the dike, and the river section near the bank was close to the top of the dike with large waves. However, Shuyang reported a drop in water level on the same day, and the dangerous period was successfully passed by the 23rd. The Xinyi River traverses the Huaiyin Special District of Northern Jiangsu, with a total length of 200 kilometers. The special district has suffered eight floods in the past five years. In order to eliminate water disasters, 590,000 laborers were mobilized successively under severe disaster conditions last winter and this spring to participate in guiding the Yi River, and the project was completed before the summer harvest.
    [This newspaper reports] (Shuyang): The Xinyi River, which runs 70 kilometers through the entire territory of Shuyang, began to rise sharply at 5:00 AM on August 18th, lasting three days and nights. It began to fall at 7:00 PM on the 20th, successfully passing the fifth flood peak. The measured flow rate of this flood reached 2,551 cubic meters per second, the largest of the river's five rises this year, and the newly constructed projects were once again severely tested.
    After the Xinyi River began to rise on August 18th, 20,000 laborers in Shuyang County, under the leadership of the County Flood Control Headquarters, launched a comprehensive and intense flood control and rescue operation. During this water flow process, 45 leaks occurred in the Shuyang section of the Xinyi River dike, as well as cracks and wave scouring of the dike toe, but they were all turned into safety through timely repairs and blockages. For example, on the night of the 18th, Zhangji District discovered a large hole 10 meters wide east of Guantian No. 20. After an hour and a half of repair and blockage by the County Engineering Team and the rescue team in that section, no danger occurred. Many cracks appeared in the sandy soil section east of Guantian Dam, but they were all filled with soil. For example, at a section south of the Xiguan Dam in Shuyang City, dozens of meters of the grass dam (fascine work) were destroyed by waves, and the toe of the dike was scoured by more than one meter, but it was quickly filled with soil packed in bulrush.
    The reasons for overcoming the flood this time are: First, the ideological preparation of the cadres and the masses was mature, and they had the confidence and determination to overcome the flood. In the month and a half of flood control, through inspections and summaries of large and small meetings, individual talks, etc., the two tendencies of negative pessimism and blind optimism were reversed. In particular, after the general inspection and patrol by the County Flood Control Headquarters in early August, a circular was issued on the 10th to determine the reward and punishment system. On the 14th, a meeting of flood control brigade leaders was held to raise everyone's vigilance and establish a concept of water conditions and a correct attitude towards flood control. Therefore, when the big flood arrived on the 18th, all dangerous sections were fully prepared for flood control and rescue. Second, there was a tight and strong flood control organization. The dike protection laborers were often organized into more than 17,000 people, divided into section protection teams, backbone teams, and rescue teams, to guard in shifts and be responsible for sections. In addition, there were reserve teams and armed forces of the sub-districts as well as cadres from the government and other public organizations, totaling more than 27,000 people, who could participate in rescue at any time. In dangerous sections, such as the Wuji and Zhangji brigades, from the brigade leader to the instructors, down to the team members, patrolled day and night, checking for seepage and leaks section by section. Third, the dike was gradually strengthened while inspecting and repairing. In a month and a half, 320,000 cubic meters of key repair work were completed, becoming a solid material foundation for flood control. Finally, there was sufficient preparation of materials, such as more than 130,000 pieces of bulrush bags and sacks, so that the dangerous sections could solve the material difficulties in blocking leaks in time. There was also sufficient preparation for the wind and wave prevention work before the flood season. In dangerous sections such as Wuji and Zhangji, the preparation of materials was particularly sufficient.

### 经过四次洪水考验和周密准备  苏北新沂河安度第五次大汛

　　经过四次洪水考验和周密准备
    苏北新沂河安度第五次大汛
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报二十四日消息：苏北新沂河已安度今年第五次大汛，获苏北水利史上空前胜利。七月份以来，该河曾四经洪水考验。八月十六日起，鲁境复降暴雨，十八日第五次最高洪水峰即入注新沂河，二十日沭阳水位上涨至九·四六公尺，实测流量达二五五一秒公方，二十一日灌云小潮河附近水距堤顶只一公尺，滨河段接近堤顶，风浪很大；但同日沭阳告跌，至二十三日危险期胜利度过。新沂河横贯苏北淮阴专区，全长二○○公里，该专区在过去五年内即遭八次洪水泛滥。为消除水患，在去冬今春严重灾情下，先后动员五十九万民工参加导沂，于夏收前突击完成。
    【本报沭阳讯】横贯沭阳全境七十公里的新沂河，于八月十八日上午五时开始猛涨，持续三昼夜，至二十日下午七时开始下降，已胜利度过第五次洪峰。此次洪水流量实测达二千五百五十一秒公方，为该河今年五次涨水中最大的一次，新修工程再一次受到严重的考验。
    十八日新沂河开始上涨后，沭阳县二万民工即在县防汛指挥部领导下，展开全面的紧张的防汛抢险工作。在这次行水过程中，新沂河堤沭阳段发生漏洞四十五处以及裂缝、风浪冲刷堤脚等危险，但终经及时抢堵，转危为安。例如十八日夜，章集区在二十号官田以东发现十公尺宽一个大洞，经县工程队和该段抢险队一个半钟头的抢堵，没有出险。官田坝以东的沙土工段，产生裂缝多处，也均填土硪实。又如沭阳城西关坝南段一处，因草坝（埽工）被风浪冲毁数十公尺，堤脚被冲刷一公尺余，但很快即用蒲包装土填好。
    此次战胜洪水的原因：第一是干部群众思想酝酿成熟，抱有战胜洪水的信心和决心。在一个半月来的防汛过程中，经过大小会议的检查总结，个别谈话等，扭转了消极悲观与盲目乐观麻痹两种倾向；特别经过八月初，县防汛指挥部的普遍检查巡视，并于十日发出通报，确定了赏罚制度；十四日又举行了防汛大队长会议，提高了大家的警觉性，建立了水情观念及正确的防汛态度。因此十八日大汛一到，各险工段均有防汛抢险的充分准备。第二是有了严密而强固的防汛组织。护堤民工经常组织有一万七千余人分为段护队、基干队、救险队，轮流防守，按段负责。此外另有五里以外的预备队及分区武装部队、机关人员二万七千余人，随时可以参加抢险。险工段吴集、章集大队，上至大队长教导员，下至队员，昼夜巡逻，逐段检查渗水、漏洞。第三是边查边修，堤身逐渐加固。在一个半月内，完成了重点加修工程三十二万公方土，成为防汛工程中巩固的物质基础。最后是器材准备充分，如蒲包麻袋即准备了十三万余件，使各险工段及时解决了堵塞漏洞中的器材困难。防风浪工作，汛前也有充分准备。在吴集、章集等险工段，器材准备尤为充分。
