Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 14th: The Korean Labor Party's organ newspaper, "Labor News," published an editorial on the 12th, calling on all the Korean people to dedicate all their strength to strive for victory in the Fatherland Liberation War to welcome the fifth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation. The editorial pointed out: It has been five years since the great Soviet army liberated the Korean people from the rule of Japanese imperialism. However, the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Lee Seung-man (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, have obstructed the unification of our fatherland and have provoked a civil war, directly extending the claws of armed aggression. Therefore, the only path facing the Korean people today is to dedicate all their strength to drive the invaders from the territory of the fatherland.

The editorial pointed out: Under the fierce attacks of the People's Army, the enemy's death throes will become even more violent, which will increase the difficulties of our struggle. However, our people will certainly be able to overcome any struggles of the enemy and overcome any difficulties. The editorial finally called on the Korean people to mobilize and strive for the arrival of victory.

    号召人民献出一切力量争取胜利
    【新华社平壤十四日电】朝鲜劳动党机关报“劳动新闻”在十二日发表的社论中，号召朝鲜全体人民献出一切力量，以争取祖国解放战争的胜利，来迎接“八、一五”解放五周年纪念日。社论指出：伟大的苏军自日本帝国主义者统治下解放朝鲜人民，已有五年。但是，美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮却阻挠我们祖国的统一。并且挑起内战，直接伸出了武装侵略的魔掌。因此，朝鲜人民今天面临的道路只有一条，这就是献出自己的一切力量，从祖国的疆土上赶走侵略者。
    社论指出：在人民军队的猛烈攻击下，敌人的垂死挣扎将更加凶暴，这将给我们的斗争，增加着困难。但是我们人民是一定能克服敌人的任何挣扎和战胜任何困难的。社论最后号召朝鲜人民动员起来，争取胜利的到来。
