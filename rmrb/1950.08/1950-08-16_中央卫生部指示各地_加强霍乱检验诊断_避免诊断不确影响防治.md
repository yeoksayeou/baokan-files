Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Central People's Government Ministry of Health, in order to strengthen cholera diagnosis, issued the "Instructions on Strengthening Cholera Testing and Diagnosis" a few days ago. The instructions first pointed out that since the beginning of summer, there have been reports of "cholera" cases in Dabu, Guangdong Province, Xuzhou City, Shandong Province, Zhengzhou City, Henan Province, Tianjin and other places, but after final laboratory diagnosis, most of them were confirmed to be acute gastroenteritis. This kind of diagnostic inaccuracy has had a considerable impact on prevention and treatment measures. Because various places have not attached importance to establishing or enriching testing institutions, they are in a flurry of activity whenever suspected cholera cases arise, sending personnel back and forth for examination, which is very costly. The instructions require local people's governments in cities with a population of more than 50,000 to enrich testing equipment as much as possible to enable them to carry out stool culture, bacterial isolation and identification work; and require them to organize local experts to study cholera diagnosis in accordance with the "Experimental Diagnostic Method for Cholera" compiled by the ministry, so that medical personnel in various places can correctly diagnose cholera.

　　中央卫生部指示各地
    加强霍乱检验诊断
    避免诊断不确影响防治
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府卫生部为加强霍乱诊断，于日前发出“关于加强霍乱检验诊断的指示”。该指示首先指出入夏以来广东省大浦、山东省徐州市、河南省郑州市、天津市等地都有过“霍乱”病例报告，但经最后实验诊断，证实多系急性胃肠炎。这种诊断上的不确实，使防治措施受到相当大的影响。由于各地未重视建立或充实检验机构，致一遇有疑似霍乱，就手忙脚乱，往返调派人员诊察，所耗不赀。该指示要求各地人民政府在五万人口以上的城市，尽量充实检验设备，使能作粪便培养细菌分离鉴别工作；并要求按照该部所编之“霍乱病实验诊断法”，组织当地专门学者对霍乱诊断加以研究，以使各地医务人员能正确进行霍乱诊断。
