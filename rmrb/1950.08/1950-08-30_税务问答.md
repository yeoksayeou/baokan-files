　　Tax Q&A
    Question:
    1.  Should electricity companies and water companies pay business tax, income tax, and stamp tax for their own use of electricity and water? Should coal mining companies pay these taxes for their own use of coal? Should flour mills pay these taxes for their own use of flour? Should transportation companies pay these taxes for their own transportation of goods?
    2.  How should stores that consign goods on behalf of customers keep their accounts and pay taxes?
    Wu Yating Zhou Jinshi
    Answer:
    1.  Electricity companies using their own electricity and water companies using their own water should both pay electricity and water fees (because it is an internal payment behavior, it can be done by transfer). In accounting, on the one hand, this amount is recorded in the "income" item of the company's business books and business tax and income tax are paid accordingly; at the same time, this expense is listed as a business expense. Because this is an internal transfer, it is not necessary to affix stamps.
    The accounting and tax treatment for coal mining companies using their own coal and flour mills using their own flour is the same, but coal and flour used must also be subject to factory tax.
    Transportation companies that transport their own goods should also calculate freight charges according to regulations and record them under the "business income" item and pay industrial and commercial taxes.
    2.  There are two situations for consigning goods on behalf of customers, and their tax payment methods are different:
    (1) The price of the goods is set by the consignor, and the agent only takes a handling fee. In this case, the agent does not need to record the sales amount in the store's sales account, but should enter it into a separate account for sales on behalf of customers. If the consignor is a stationary merchant, the above sales can be recorded in the sales account and industrial and commercial taxes paid. If the consignor is a travelling merchant, temporary commercial tax must be paid. The agent only pays industrial and commercial tax on the income from the handling fee.
    (2) If both parties negotiate that the consignor will receive a net amount for each item of goods, and the agent determines the selling price independently, and the agent does not charge an additional handling fee. In this case, it should be treated as self-sale by the agent. The sales amount should be entered into the agent's books and industrial and commercial taxes paid accordingly. If the consignor is a stationary merchant, the net proceeds from the goods are entered into the sales account and industrial and commercial taxes paid. If the consignor is a travelling merchant, temporary commercial tax must be paid.

　　税务问答
    问：
    一、电业公司和自来水公司自用水、电，煤矿公司自己用煤，面粉厂自己用面粉，转运公司自己运货，是否应缴营业税、所得税和印花税？
    二、某些商店代客寄卖物品，应如何记账及纳税？
    吴雅庭  周今是
    答：
    一、电业公司自己用电，自来水公司自己用水，均应缴纳电费水费（因是内部收付行为，可用转账方式）。在会计处理上，一方面把这项款项记入公司营业账簿的“收入”项目内，照缴营业税与所得税；同时将这项费用列作营业开支。因为这是内部转账方式，所以不必立据贴印花。
    煤矿公司自己用煤，面粉厂自己用面粉，在会计及纳税的处理上也一样，但是用煤与用面粉等还须缴纳出厂税。
    转运公司自运货物，也应该照章计算运费，记入“营业收入”项下，缴纳工商税。
    二、代客寄卖物品，有以下两种情况，其纳税方式不同：
    （一）货价由委托者规定，代理者只取手续费。在这种情况下，代理者不必把销货额记入本店销货账，应另入代客销货账。委托者如果是座商，可将上项销货记入销货账，缴纳工商税。委托者如系行商，须缴纳临时商业税。代理者仅就所得之手续费收益缴纳工商业税。
    （二）如双方协商，委托者每件货物净得若干，售价由代理者自行规定，代理者不另取手续费。此种情况，应按代理者自销处理。销货额应入代理者账簿，照缴工商业税。委托者如系座商，按净得货款入销货账，缴纳工商业税。如系行商，须缴纳临时商业税。
