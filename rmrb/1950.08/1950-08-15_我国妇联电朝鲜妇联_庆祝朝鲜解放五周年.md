Xinhua News Agency, August 15th: The All-China Democratic Women's Federation recently sent a letter to the Korean Democratic Women's Federation to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Korea's liberation. The original letter is as follows: To Madam Park Chung-ae and Madam Liu Young-joon of the Korean Democratic Women's Federation:

　　As the Korean People's Army and all the Korean people are achieving great victories in the war against the American imperialist aggression, we, the Chinese women, are celebrating your Liberation Day with extreme excitement.

　　We express our heartfelt admiration and warm greetings to the heroic Korean People's Army, to our Korean brothers and sisters who are resolutely supporting the front lines and bravely resisting the invaders under the shameless bombing by American imperialist aircraft. The victory of the Korean people once again proves that the people who fight for justice are invincible, and the invaders are nothing but paper tigers with a fierce appearance but faint of heart. We firmly believe that the American imperialists will soon be completely driven out of Korean territory by the Korean people.

　　The more the invaders suffer defeat, the closer they get to death, the more frantic they become. For example, the notorious warmonger MacArthur recently ran between Japan and Taiwan and openly stated that he would use force to prevent our People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan. There is no doubt that he will still be defeated and driven out of Taiwan by us. Similarly, the people of all Asia will inevitably unite closely and work together to finally drive the invaders out of Asia.

　　On your Liberation Day, let us shout:

　　Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

　　Long live General Kim Il-sung!

　　Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

　　Drive the invaders out of Asia! Defend world peace!

　　 All-China Democratic Women's Federation, August 15th

　　我国妇联电朝鲜妇联  庆祝朝鲜解放五周年
    【新华社十五日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会顷致函朝鲜民主妇女联合会，祝贺朝鲜解放五周年。原函如下：朝鲜民主妇女联合会朴正爱刘英俊夫人：
    正当朝鲜人民军和全朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义的侵略战争中获得了伟大胜利的时候，我们中国妇女以万分兴奋的心情来热烈祝贺你们的解放日。
    我们对英勇战斗的朝鲜人民军，对在美帝国主义飞机无耻滥炸下仍坚决支援前线，英勇抗击侵略者的朝鲜兄弟姊妹们，表示衷心的钦佩，并致热忱的慰问。朝鲜人民的胜利再一次证明：为正义而战的人民是无敌的，侵略者不过是外强中干的纸老虎。我们坚信美帝国主义者不久即将被朝鲜人民全部从朝鲜领土上赶出去。
    侵略者越遭受失败，越接近死亡，也就越疯狂。如臭名远扬的战争贩子麦克阿瑟最近在日本与台湾之间奔跑，并公开表示要用武力阻止我人民解放军解放台湾。毫无疑问，他仍将遭到失败，而被我们赶出台湾去。同样，全亚洲人民，必然会紧密团结起来，共同努力，把侵略者最后赶出亚洲去。
    谨在你们的解放日让我们高呼：
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国万岁！
    金日成将军万岁！
    中朝人民友谊万岁！
    把侵略者赶出亚洲去！保卫世界和平！
            中华全国民主妇女联合会  八月十五日
