　　Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Protest Against the United States:
    Demand Blood Debt Repayment from U.S. Imperialism!
    U.S. imperialism has become a complete mad dog. Its two hind paws are clutching Taiwan Island, its bloodied dog teeth are still biting at the Korean people, and one of its front paws is now provoking our northeastern border. This mad dog's blood-red eyes are searching everywhere for something to sink its teeth into. The whole world is threatened by it. In its eyes, all people who demand liberation, who want to live in peace, who demand democratic rights, are all worthy of death. It howls madly, using various tones, trying to scare people.

    However, U.S. imperialism, this mad dog, is just a dying mad dog struggling in the eyes of the Asian people. On the Chinese mainland, this mad dog was once beaten into the water, and now it is showing its fangs and claws, wanting to bite us again. The fate awaiting it is still falling into the water. It thought the Korean people were easy to bully, but on the contrary, the Korean people are brave and invincible. Sooner or later, the Korean people will also beat this mad dog into the water. All people who demand independence and freedom are invincible. This is a truth that the crazed U.S. imperialists do not understand. They only know how to use deception, bribery, and threats to drive the youth of their own country and their vassal states to be cannon fodder. However, these cannon fodder who have been deceived, bribed, and threatened encountered not the sheep-like slaves they imagined on the Korean peninsula, but the angry and brave People's Army, and they obediently raised their hands immediately! This is a bloody lesson. Now the only trick of the U.S. imperialists is to indiscriminately bomb peaceful cities. This is an old trick that the Japanese imperialists once used. The result: blood debts must be repaid double!

    U.S. imperialists are now a wounded mad dog. Before it dies, it will bite a few more times. The Korean people, the Chinese people, and other Asian people who demand liberation must knock out its dog teeth and break its dog legs. Prepare well and finally send this mad dog to its doom!
    茅盾 [Mao Dun]

    U.S. imperialism and its gang of accomplices are conducting inhumane, historically rare bombings of peaceful cities and working people in Korea day and night, attempting to save its irretrievable defeat. Now, American planes stained with the blood of the Korean people have appeared over our homeland, the beautiful northeastern cities, wanting the Chinese people to shed blood. This is not an accidental event; it is part of U.S. imperialism's policy of destroying peace and carrying out aggression. All peace-loving people around the world should be vigilant. The Chinese people will inevitably unite and rise up, exhausting the wisdom and strength of 475 million people, supporting the People's Government, defending world peace, and together with the people of the world, smashing the U.S. imperialist conspiracy of aggression and burying the warmongers in the graveyard of history.
    丁玲 [Ding Ling]

    The American planes that invaded Korea this time continuously intruded into our country's airspace yesterday (August 27th), damaging our buildings and vehicles, and strafing our people, causing injuries and deaths. We believe this is a provocation by U.S. imperialists against the Chinese people. Since the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea and simultaneously invaded our Taiwan, our entire people have unanimously and resolutely opposed it. Now, the imperialists are even more revealing their hideous faces, infringing upon our national sovereignty and slaughtering our people. This kind of madness and brutality proves that only imperialism likes war and creates war; it also proves that the imperialists have reached the end of their rope and are disregarding everything. We support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to Acheson. I hope that all the people of China will unite! All peace-loving people of the world, unite and overthrow American imperialism!
    辅仁大学校校长 陈垣 [Chen Yuan, President of Fu Jen Catholic University]

    Since the U.S. imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, they have been unanimously opposed by peace-loving people all over the world and have been relentlessly attacked by the Korean people. Now, they are disregarding all international morality and, in addition to invading our Taiwan, are further using aircraft to invade our northeastern airspace and carry out bandit-like attacks on our peace-loving people, resulting in dozens of casualties. This kind of bandit behavior is intolerable to us. We express our utmost anger and issue the most serious protest to the U.S. imperialists. We fully support Premier Zhou's statement. U.S. imperialists must admit their mistakes, punish the murderers, compensate for the losses of our people, and guarantee that the same incident will not happen again in the future.
    北大工学院院长 马大猷 [Ma Dayou, Dean of the College of Engineering, Peking University]

    U.S. imperialist planes continuously reconnoitered and strafed our northeastern airspace five times in one day. This clearly shows that this is not an unintentional error by individual U.S. Air Force personnel, but a planned and tentative provocation by U.S. imperialism. This, together with Austin's words in the United Nations Security Council, is exactly U.S. imperialism holding up a "demon-revealing mirror" to its own monster face: barbaric, ugly, and devoid of humanity.

    Historical destiny has determined the survival of all imperialists, the only question is when. If U.S. imperialism wants to make a desperate struggle, an all-out struggle, the result will be an earlier end to its own life. If it vainly attempts to expand its provocations and aggression against China, the Chinese people are not afraid. The Chinese people have personally witnessed how the U.S. imperialists helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and the result was how futile it was in preventing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's collapse. They have also personally witnessed how the U.S. imperialists helped Syngman Rhee, and the result was how futile it was in preventing Syngman Rhee's collapse. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan and are determined to assist the Korean people's liberation cause. The U.S. imperialists' provocative crimes will not scare us, but will further strengthen our confidence.

　　拥护周外长对美国的抗议
    向美帝国主义讨还血债！
    美帝国主义已是一条十足的疯狗，它的两只后爪夹住了台湾岛，它的被打得血淋淋的狗牙还在乱咬着朝鲜人民，它的一只前爪现在又向我东北边境挑衅。这条疯狗的血红的眼睛在到处寻找有什么可以下口的地方就猛咬一口。全世界都受着它的威胁。在它的眼中看来，凡是要求解放、要求和平地生活、要求民主权利的人民全是该死的，它疯狂地叫嗥，用各种调子叫嗥，想唬吓人。
    然而美帝国主义这条疯狗在亚洲人民眼里只是一条垂死挣扎的疯狗。在中国大陆上，这条疯狗曾经被打落水，现在它又张牙舞爪想再来咬我们一口，等待着它的命运还是落水。它以朝鲜人民为可欺，可是相反，朝鲜人民是英勇无敌的，朝鲜人民迟早也要把这条疯狗打落水去，凡是要求独立自由的人民都是无敌的，这是一条真理，疯狂了的美帝国主义者就是不懂得这条真理，它只懂得，用欺骗、利诱、威胁的方法，驱遣它本国的以及它的仆从国家的青年去做炮灰。然而这些被欺骗、被利诱、被威胁来的炮灰们在朝鲜半岛所遇到的不是他们幻想中的绵羊似的奴隶而是愤怒勇敢的人民军，他们也就乖乖地立刻高举了双手！这是血淋淋的教训。现在美帝国主义者唯一的技俩只是滥炸和平城市，这是日本帝国主义者曾经使用过的老把戏。结果如何：血债是要加倍偿还的！
    美帝国主义者现在是一条打伤了的疯狗，临死之前，它还会猛咬几口，朝鲜人民，中国人民，亚洲其他要求解放的人民，一定要打落它的狗牙，打断它的狗腿。好好地准备着吧，最后地发送这条疯狗！
    茅盾
    美帝国主义及其一群帮凶，正在无分昼夜地对朝鲜的和平城市与劳动人民，进行灭绝人性的、历史上少有的轰炸，妄图以此来挽救它不能挽回的失败。现在，染满了朝鲜人民鲜血的美国飞机，又已经出现在我国本土、美丽的东北城市上空，要我们中国人民流血了。这决不是偶然事件，这是美帝国主义破坏和平，进行侵略政策的一部分。全世界爱好和平的人们，应该警惕。中国人民必然会团结奋起，竭尽四万万七千五百万人民的智慧与力量，拥护人民政府，保卫世界和平，与全世界人民一起，粉碎美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，把战争贩子们葬送在历史的坟墓里。
    丁玲
    这次侵略朝鲜的美机在昨天（八月二十七日）一天之内，连续侵入我国领土上空，击坏我建筑物、车辆，扫射我国人民以致伤亡，我们认为这是美帝国主义者向中国人民挑衅。自从美帝发动侵略朝鲜的战争，同时侵略我国的台湾，我们全国人民，一致坚决反对。现在，帝国主义者更加露出狰狞的面貌，侵犯我国主权，屠杀我国人民，这种疯狂和残暴，可以证明只有帝国主义才是喜欢战争，制造战争；也可证明帝国主义者已到日暮途穷不顾一切的境地了。我们拥护周外长对艾奇逊的抗议，我愿全中国的人民，一致团结起来！全世界爱好和平的人民，大家团结起来，打倒美国帝国主义！
    辅仁大学校校长  陈垣
    美国帝国主义者发动侵略朝鲜的战争以来，遭到了全世界爱好和平的人们一致反对，并且受到朝鲜人民的无情打击。现在它居然不顾一切国际上起码的道义，在侵略我国领土台湾之余进一步用飞机侵入我国东北领空，并对我爱好和平的人民作强盗式的袭击，致有死伤二三十人之多。这种强盗行为不是我们所能忍受的。我们以无比的愤怒对美帝发出最严重的抗议。我们完全拥护周总理的声明。美国帝国主义者必须承认错误，惩罚凶手，赔偿我国人民的损失，并且保证以后不再发生同样事件。
    北大工学院院长  马大猷
    美帝飞机，在一天之内，连续五次在我东北领空侦察和扫射，这很明显地说明，这不是美空军个人之无意错误，而是美帝之有计划的试探性的挑衅。这和奥斯汀在联合国安理会所说的话，合起来看正好是美帝自己拿着“照妖镜”来照自己的妖怪面孔：野蛮，丑恶丧失人性。
    历史的命运，已决定了一切帝国主义者的存亡，问题只是时间的早晚。美帝要想作垂死的挣扎，作不顾一切的挣扎，那结果将是更早地结束自己的生命。它如果妄想扩大对中国的挑衅和侵略，中国人民是无所畏惧的。中国人民亲眼看见美帝曾如何帮助蒋匪帮，而结果又是如何无益于蒋匪帮的溃败。又亲眼看见美帝如何帮助李承晚，而结果又是如何无益于李承晚的溃败。中国人民要坚决地解放台湾，要坚决地援助朝鲜人民的解放事业。美帝的挑衅罪行，吓不倒我们却更加坚强了我们的信心。
