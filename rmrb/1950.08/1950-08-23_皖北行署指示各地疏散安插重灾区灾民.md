(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Northern Anhui Daily News: The Northern Anhui Administrative Office, in order to organize and systematically resettle the 1.09 million disaster victims in Northern Anhui who suffered severe flooding, and to carry out production for self-salvation, issued on August 3rd the "Decision on Temporarily Evacuating Homeless Disaster Victims." The instructions stipulated that the evacuation and resettlement of disaster victims should primarily be within the same special district, and if there were difficulties, they could also be introduced to other special districts for resettlement. It has now been determined that the Chuxian and Chaohu special districts will be responsible for resettling disaster victims from the Suxian special district, and the Lu'an and Anqing special districts will be responsible for resettling disaster victims from the Fuyang special district. Disaster relief work committees will be jointly formed by the local governments responsible for resettlement and the governments of the disaster-stricken areas to uniformly carry out the work of resettling disaster victims. At the same time, liaison stations should be set up on the south bank of the Huai River and other evacuation routes to assist disaster victims in evacuation. Local governments should promptly register disaster victims who have automatically fled to various places and issue temporary residence permits. After the evacuation and resettlement of disaster victims, the local government must lead and help the disaster victims to carry out various productions. However, in general, disaster victims should return home after the autumn harvest to participate in water control work, which is a work-for-food project, to completely eliminate the flood disaster. The instructions finally require local governments to educate the masses to promote class friendship and do their best to help disaster victims from other places. The Chuxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and the special district jointly issued instructions to their subordinates on the 6th, requiring governments at all levels and the masses to respond to the call of the administrative office, promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity, and quickly and properly accommodate and help disaster victims from other places. The Chaohu Special District has held an emergency meeting and established a disaster relief resettlement committee to carry out disaster relief resettlement work; at the same time, more than one million catties of grain have been allocated to meet the urgent needs of disaster victims, and another 90,000 catties of rice have been allocated to purchase medicines, and Chinese and Western doctors and health centers and hospitals have been mobilized to provide medical services for disaster victims.

　　皖北行署指示各地疏散安插重灾区灾民
    【本报讯】据皖北日报讯：皖北行署为了有组织有计划的安置皖北遭受严重水灾的一百零九万灾民，进行生产自救，特于八月三日发布“关于暂时疏散无家可归之灾民的决定”。指示规定灾民的疏散安置，以安插在本专区为主，如有困难亦可介绍到其他专区安插。现已确定滁县、巢湖两专区，负责安置宿县专区重灾民；六安、安庆两专区负责安置阜阳专区重灾民。并由负责安置的地方政府与受灾地区的政府双方合组灾民工作委员会，统一进行安置灾民工作。同时在淮河南岸及其他疏散线上各要道设联络站，帮助灾民疏散。已自动逃到各地的灾民，所在地政府应迅速登记，发临时居住证。灾民疏散安插后，当地政府必须领导与帮助灾民进行各种生产。但一般灾民均应在秋后大兴水利时，回家参加以工代赈的治水工作，以彻底消除水患。指示最后要求各地政府教育群众发扬阶级友爱，尽力帮助外来灾民。现滁县中共地委与专区已于六日联合向所属发出指示，要各级政府与群众响应行署号召，发扬互助友爱精神，迅速妥善地收容和帮助外来灾民。巢湖专区已召开紧急会议，成立了安置灾民委员会，进行安置灾民工作；同时拨粮百万余斤，以供灾民急需，另拨九万斤大米，购置药材，并动员中西医生及卫生所、医院为灾民担任医疗工作。
