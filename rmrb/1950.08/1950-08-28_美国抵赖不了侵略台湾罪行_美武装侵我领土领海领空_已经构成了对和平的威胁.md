Xinhua News Agency, August 27th – Following Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegram to the UN Security Council President Malik and Secretary-General Lie on August 24th, accusing the United States of aggression against our territory Taiwan and demanding that the UN Security Council order the withdrawal of U.S. armed forces from Taiwan, U.S. Department of Defense officials hurriedly issued statements in an attempt to cover up the fact of U.S. aggression against Taiwan. According to a U.S. Information Service dispatch from Washington on August 25th: "U.S. Department of Defense officials solemnly declared that there are no U.S. military personnel in Taiwan, not even a military mission. The Air Force claimed that no U.S. aircraft are stationed in Taiwan. The Navy Department said that naval aircraft and ships have not visited Taiwan recently."

The U.S. Department of Defense officials are so flustered that they believe they can deceive the world. However, the fact is that the U.S. armed interventionists have not only dispatched their aggressive forces to Taiwan but are also strengthening them. The U.S. military mission in Taiwan has existed for a long time. Before July of this year, a group of U.S. military generals, led by former U.S. Western Pacific Fleet Commander Kirk, were in Taiwan assisting the Kuomintang bandit gang in making military deployments. After the outbreak of the U.S. aggression against Korea, MacArthur openly appointed a military liaison group headed by his Deputy Chief of Staff Fox to be stationed in Taiwan. Regarding the nature of this "military liaison group," the Kuomintang Central News Agency reported on August 10th: "The name of the military liaison group may soon be changed to a more practical name because this organization will have the power to command the U.S. Navy and Air Force in Taiwan; that is to say, the Seventh Fleet and the Thirteenth Air Fleet defending Taiwan will also be controlled and commanded by the current liaison group." Sure enough, from August 16th, the liaison group was changed to the U.S. Far East Military Survey Mission in Taiwan. The head of the mission was Fox, the original head of the liaison group; the deputy head was Fortier, Fox's senior aide. Although the mission uses the name "survey mission," it absolutely cannot conceal the nature of its military mission organization. On August 22nd, MacArthur reassigned Conkle, a senior official of the U.S. Far East Military Command, as the head of the mission, while Fox left Taipei for Tokyo on the 26th.

The U.S. aggressors' navy has not only "not visited Taiwan recently" but has also been traveling back and forth very frequently. Since August 5th, a total of eleven U.S. destroyers, cruisers, supply ships, and transport ships have arrived at Keelung and Kaohsiung ports. Just four days before the U.S. Navy Department announced that U.S. naval vessels had "not visited Taiwan recently," on the 21st, the 25,000-ton U.S. cruiser USS Austin arrived in Keelung. Another heavy cruiser of more than 30,000 tons also entered the port on the 25th. Misemore, the commander of the U.S. ships stationed in the Taiwan Strait by the U.S. Seventh Fleet, also arrived in Keelung on the 22nd.

The U.S. aggressors' air force stationed in Taiwan is an open secret. The Kuomintang Central News Agency reported from Taipei on August 4th: "A government spokesperson announced today: The United States, in order to help defend Taiwan, has dispatched several jet aircraft to be stationed in Taiwan and arrived today. U.S. Thirteenth Air Force Commander General Tenner has also arrived in Taiwan." The official establishment of the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force in Taiwan was established on the 7th of this month. According to its commander, Tenner, this agency is located within the Kuomintang bandit gang's Air Force Headquarters. The day before (August 6th), Tenner told a United Press reporter: "There is no need to keep the fact that jet planes are stationed in Taiwan a secret. Of course, there are many facts that we have not revealed to any possible enemy." (United Press Taipei, August 6th) On the 18th, several jet planes from the Thirteenth Air Force flew from Manila to Taipei. Before this, a group of personnel from the team who were transferred to Taiwan also arrived in Taiwan.

The above facts prove that the U.S. armed forces have violated our territory, territorial waters, and airspace, interfered in our internal affairs, violated the United Nations Charter, and constituted a threat to peace. This is something that U.S. Department of Defense officials cannot deny.

### 美国抵赖不了侵略台湾罪行  美武装侵我领土领海领空  已经构成了对和平的威胁

　　美国抵赖不了侵略台湾罪行
    美武装侵我领土领海领空
    已经构成了对和平的威胁
    【新华社二十七日讯】在我国周恩来外长于本月二十四日致电联合国安理会主席马立克及秘书长赖伊，控诉美国侵略我国领土台湾并要求联合国安理会命令美国武装力量撤出台湾后，美国国防部的官员们慌忙发表谈话，力图掩饰美国侵略台湾的事实。据美国新闻处华盛顿八月二十五日电称：“美国国防部官员们郑重声明，台湾并无美国军事人员，甚至没有军事使团。空军宣称，并无美国飞机驻于台湾。海军部说，海军飞机及船舰最近并未访问台湾。”
    美国国防部的官员们是如此慌张，竟以为他们可以只手遮天。然而，事实是美国武装干涉者不仅业已向台湾派出其侵略武装，而且正予以加强中。美国在台湾的军事使团许久以来就存在。在今年七月以前，以前美国西太平洋舰队司令柯克为首的一群美国军事将领即在台湾协助国民党匪帮进行军事部署。美国侵略朝鲜战争爆发后，麦克阿瑟即公开任命以其副参谋长福克斯为首的军事联络组驻于台湾。关于这一“军事联络组”的性质，国民党中央社八月十日电称：“军事联络组这一名称不久或将改为更切合实际一些的名称，因为这一组织将有权指挥美国在台的海军和空军；也就是说，协防台湾的第七舰队和第十三舰空队亦将由现在的联络组控制和指挥。”果然从本月十六日起，该联络组即改为美国远东军事驻台考察团。团长由原联络组组长福克斯担任；副团长由福之高级幕僚福铁尔担任。该团虽用“考察团”名称，但绝对掩盖不了它是军事使团性质的组织。本月二十二日麦克阿瑟又改调美国远东军事统帅部高级官员康克莱任团长，福克斯则于二十六日离台北飞东京。
    美国侵略者的海军，不仅不是“最近并未访问台湾”，而且往来甚为频繁。从本月五日起，先后抵达基隆和高雄等港口的美国驱逐舰、巡洋舰、供应舰、运输舰等共计十一舰。就在美国海军部宣布美海军舰船“最近并未访问台湾”的前四天，即二十一日，两万五千吨的美国巡洋舰奥斯脱号就抵达基隆。另一艘约三万余吨的重巡洋舰也在二十五日入港。美国第七舰队派驻台湾海峡的美舰指挥官米斯摩，亦于二十二日抵基隆。
    美国侵略者空军驻在台湾更是公开的秘密。国民党中央社本月四日台北电称：“政府发言人今宣布：美国为协助保卫台湾，已派遣喷气式飞机若干架驻扎台湾，并于今日抵达。美国第十三航空队司令滕纳将军亦已抵台。”美国第十三航空队驻台的正式机构随即于本月七日成立。据其司令滕纳说，这一机构设在国民党匪帮的空军总司令部内。在此前一日（本月六日），滕纳告合众社记者说：“不需要把喷气飞机驻在台湾一事保守秘密。当然，有许多事实我们没有泄露给任何可能的敌人。”（合众社台北六日电）十八日又有第十三航空队若干架喷气机由马尼拉飞台北。在此以前，该队所属一批调台服务人员，也到达了台湾。
    以上事实证明，美国武装力量已侵犯我国领土、领海和领空、干涉我国内政、违犯联合国宪章，构成了对和平的威胁。这是美国国防部官员们抵赖不了的。
