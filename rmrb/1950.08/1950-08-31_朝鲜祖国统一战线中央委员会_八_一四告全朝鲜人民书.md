　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front published a "Letter to All Korean People" on August 14, calling on all Korean people to sign the letter. The full text of the letter to the people is as follows:

    Dear compatriots:
    Foreign intervention in Korea has been going on for two months. The American interventionist troops are massacring our sons and daughters, American warships are shelling our country's coasts, and American planes are daily conducting bestial attacks on our cities and villages, killing peaceful residents, and destroying the factories, enterprises, railways, and homes that the Korean people have rebuilt.

    The American imperialists, who have long attempted to turn Korea into a colony and a military base for aggression in the Far East, with the help of the Lee Seung-man gang, launched a civil war in Korea and are carrying out armed intervention against our people.

    Under the guise of the Security Council's illegal decisions on Korea, the American imperialists are trampling on our people's rights to freedom and independence.

    The American imperialists are trying to cover up their acts of aggression against Korea with the rhetoric of supporting peace and freedom.

    But if it were not for the aggressive policy of the American imperialists, who used the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang to obstruct the reunification of the fatherland, the Korean people would now be able to engage in their own peaceful construction.

    If it were not for the American imperialists, who made the South Korean people groan under the tyranny of Lee Seung-man and provoked a civil war, our people would not be bleeding now.

    If the American aggressors had not invaded our country's territory, the civil war launched by the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang might have ended long ago.

    The American imperialists are the most vicious enemies of the Korean people, the enemies of peace, and the instigators of war.

    The American imperialists are destroying Korean cities and villages, while talking about "freedom" and other nonsense.

    Based on their many years of painful experience, the Korean people clearly know what the "freedom" spoken of by Japan, the United States, and all other imperialists who rely on the cruel exploitation of the people of colonies and dependent countries to maintain their own wealth, means.

    We do not need the kind of "freedom" in America that the American imperialists clamor about while standing on the heads of black people.

    We do not need the kind of "freedom" of the South American people, who are subjected to the cruel exploitation of American imperialism and are plunged into poverty and lack of rights.

    The kind of "freedom" that the American occupation forces, with the help of the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang, force the South Korean people to suffer from poverty and lack of rights, is not what we need.

    This state of poverty and lack of rights has astonished all the North Korean people who have visited South Korea.

    For those who support democracy and the freedom and independence of the Korean people, the American-style, Lee Seung-man-style "freedom" that means imprisonment, torture, and execution is not needed.

    When the American imperialists speak of the freedom of the Korean people, they are thinking of the "freedom" of the American capitalists to proudly exploit the blood and sweat of the Korean people, whom they do not treat as human beings, in order to pursue profits.

    We do not need this kind of "freedom." The Korean people want true freedom, freedom without foreign imperialist interference, freedom without the Lee Seung-man traitorous gang who help the American imperialists, sell out the interests of the Korean people, and fill their own pockets with dollars.

    Our heroic People's Army, guerrillas, and all the Korean people have devoted all their strength in the heroic struggle against the American interventionists and the Lee Seung-man gang to win the freedom, reunification, and independence of their motherland. They are ready to defend their rights by taking up arms and stopping the encroachment of foreign interventionists and their Korean lackeys.

    The North Korean people have expressed their determination to defend with their lives the democratic reforms that they have already achieved and that have opened up a path of progress, prosperity, and freedom for them.

    The South Korean people have shown that five years of American occupation and Lee Seung-man's police rule have failed to weaken their will to demand freedom, even in the face of persecution and the gallows.

    The South and North Korean people, who have risen up against the American interventionists and the Lee Seung-man gang, have a consistent will for the reunification and independence of the fatherland. They unanimously support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and are full of determination to completely drive out foreign interventionists from our country's territory and fight to the end for final victory.

    We yearn for the freedom and independence of the fatherland. We call on all compatriots to unanimously demand a cessation of intervention, the withdrawal of interventionist troops from Korea, and respect for the rights of the Korean people.

    We call on all compatriots to regard the Lee Seung-man gang, the accomplices of the American interventionists, as traitors to the Korean people, to make them confess all the crimes they have committed on the people's public trial stage, and to hold them fully responsible.

    We call on all patriots to sign the following Korean People's Declaration:

    1. We demand that the United Nations immediately stop the American armed intervention and immediately take measures to withdraw the troops of foreign interventionists from Korea.

    2. We believe that Lee Seung-man, Lee Bum-suk, Kim Seong-su, Shin Sung-mo, Cho Byeong-ok, Baek Seong-uk, Yoon Chi-young, Shin Heung-woo, Shin Ik-hee, Jang Myeon, etc., who launched the civil war in Korea under the instructions of the American imperialists and actively helped the interventionists in the struggle against the Korean people, must be handed over to the people's public trial as traitors to the Korean people.

    We believe that all those who respect the freedom, reunification, and independence of our fatherland will widely launch a national struggle against the American interventionists and their accomplices, so that the powerful voice of the Korean people against the interventionists and in defense of their rights will resound throughout the world, and will sign the declaration.

    Long live the heroic People's Army, which is gloriously defending the freedom and independence of our country!

    Long live our free, unified, and independent motherland!

    Long live the freedom-loving Korean people!

    Forward to victory, for the reunification, freedom, and independence of our fatherland!

　　朝鲜祖国统一战线中央委员会
    八·一四告全朝鲜人民书
    【新华社讯】平壤讯：朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会于八月十四日发表“告全朝鲜人民书”，并号召全朝鲜人民在该书上签名。告人民书全文如下：亲爱的同胞们：
    外国干涉朝鲜已有两个月了。美国干涉者的军队虐杀着我们的儿女，美国军舰炮击着我国的海岸，美国飞机逐日对我国的城市和农村进行兽性的袭击，杀害和平居民，破坏着朝鲜人民修复起来的工厂、企业、铁道、住宅。
    从很早以前就企图变朝鲜为殖民地和侵略远东的军事基地的美帝国主义者，在李承晚匪徒的帮助下，在朝鲜发动了内战，并进行着反对我国人民的武装干涉。
    美帝国主义者以安理会对朝鲜的非法决定为掩护，蹂躏着我们人民自由和独立的权利。
    美帝国主义者企图以拥护和平和自由的鬼话来掩蔽他们对朝鲜的侵略行为。
    但是假若没有利用李承晚卖国匪帮阻挠祖国统一的美帝国主义者的侵略政策，那么，朝鲜人民现在已能从事自己的和平建设事业。
    假若没有使南朝鲜人民呻吟在李承晚暴政下并挑起内战的美帝国主义，我们人民现在就不至于流血。
    假若美国侵略者没有侵入我们祖国的疆土，那么，李承晚卖国匪帮所发动的内战可能早已结束了。
    美帝国主义者是朝鲜人民最凶恶的仇敌，是和平的敌人，是战争挑拨者。
    美帝国主义者破坏着朝鲜的城市和农村，又满口说着“自由”等等的鬼话。
    朝鲜人民根据他们多年来的沉痛经验，清楚地知道依靠残酷剥削殖民地和附属国人民以维持自己富裕生活的日本、美国及其他一切帝国主义者所说的“自由”，意味着什么。
    我们不需要美帝国主义站在黑人头上所叫嚣的那种黑人在美国的“自由”。
    我们不需要像遭受美帝国主义残酷剥削而陷入贫困和没有权利的南美洲人民的那种“自由”。
    美国占领军在李承晚卖国匪帮的帮助下，迫使南朝鲜人民遭受贫困，无权利的那种“自由”，是我们不需要的。
    这种贫穷和无权利的状态，使得到过南朝鲜的一切北朝鲜人民，为之惊愕。
    对于拥护民主、拥护朝鲜人民的自由、独立的人们来说，不需要那种意味着监禁、拷问、枪毙的美国式、李承晚式的“自由”。
    当美帝国主义者说着朝鲜人民的自由时，他们想到的是：骄傲地利用他们不当人看待的朝鲜人民的血汗来追求利润的那种美国资本家的“自由”。
    我们不需要这种“自由”。朝鲜人民要真正的自由，没有外国帝国主义者干涉的自由，没有那些帮助美帝国主义者、出卖朝鲜人民的利益而以美元充饱私囊的李承晚卖国匪帮的自由。
    我们英勇的人民军、游击队和全朝鲜人民，在反对美国干涉者和李承晚匪帮的英勇斗争中，献出了一切力量，来争取自己祖国的自由、统一和独立。他们已有手执武器、制止外国干涉者及其朝鲜走狗的侵害以保卫自己权利的准备。
    北朝鲜人民表示出他们不惜以生命保卫业已取得的、给自己开辟了进步、繁荣、自由道路的民主改革的决心。
    南朝鲜人民表现出在美国占领和李承晚警察统治的五年中，迫害和绞刑台也未能削弱他们要求自由的意志。
    为反对美国干涉者和李承晚匪帮而奋起的南、北朝鲜人民，对祖国的统一、独立有着一致的意志。他们一致支持着朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，充满了从我国疆土上完全驱逐外国干涉者，为取得最后胜利而斗争到底的决心。
    我们渴望着祖国的自由和独立。我们号召全体同胞一致要求停止干涉、从朝鲜撤退干涉者的军队并尊重朝鲜人民的权利。
    我们号召全体同胞要把美国干涉者的帮凶——李承晚匪帮，认为朝鲜人民的叛徒，要他们在人民的公审台上供认自己所犯的一切罪行，并使他们负完全责任。
    我们号召全体爱国者在如下的朝鲜人民声明书上签名：
    一、我们要求联合国立即制止美国的武装干涉，立即采取措施，使外国干涉者的军队撤出朝鲜。
    二、我们认为在美帝国主义者的指使下，在朝鲜发动内战并在反对朝鲜人民的斗争中积极帮助干涉者的李承晚、李范奭、金性洙、申性模、赵炳玉、白性郁、尹致暎、申兴雨、申翼熙、张勉等，必须当作朝鲜人民的叛徒交由人民公审。
    我们相信：凡是尊重我祖国的自由、统一和独立的人，都会广泛地展开反对美国干涉者及其帮凶的全民斗争，使朝鲜人民反对干涉者、保卫自己权利的有力呼声，响彻全世界，而在声明书上签名的。
    光荣地捍卫着我国自由、独立的英勇的人民军万岁！
    我们自由的、统一的、独立的祖国万岁！
    爱自由的朝鲜人民万岁！
    向着胜利，为我们祖国的统一、自由、独立而前进！
