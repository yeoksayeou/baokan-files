Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The Northwest District's Second Tax Conference was held from July 18th to 25th. In addition to the heads of tax bureaus from the five provinces and one municipality in the Northwest, more than 30 representatives of private industrial and commercial enterprises from major cities such as Xi'an, Baoji, Nanzheng, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Pingliang, Dihua, Xining, and Yinchuan were invited to participate. This played a significant role in communicating public-private relations and increasing taxpayers' understanding of the state's tax policies.

　　Under the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, the conference summarized and reviewed past work, and, based on the spirit of the Second National Tax Conference, discussed the adjustment of tax revenue in various parts of the Northwest. Finally, it formulated eight specific measures regarding the establishment of tax review committees in counties and cities, the organization and management of industrialists and merchants, and so on. The conference unanimously agreed that the tax work in the Northwest over the past six months had achieved great success. However, there were still many shortcomings in the specific implementation process. For example, the control of tax sources was not done well enough, and it had not been done well to benefit businesses and make things convenient for the people. Some tax cadres had rigid work styles, and there was a lack of in-depth investigation and research, resulting in phenomena of uneven burden.

　　Private industrial and commercial representatives attending the conference put forward many positive opinions on the future tax work in the Northwest. At the same time, they also acknowledged that the past behavior of some industrial and commercial households in concealing assets and business conditions was also one of the main factors contributing to the above-mentioned shortcomings. The industrial and commercial representatives expressed satisfaction with the central government's policy, measures, and tax regulations for adjusting tax revenue this time, and stated that they would abide by laws and regulations in the future and assist the government in completing its tasks.

　　The conference held a heated discussion on the issue of industrial and commercial tax collection methods and the relationship between tax rates and tasks. Finally, it unanimously agreed that, given the imperfect accounting systems of industrial and commercial households in the Northwest, democratic appraisal should be the main collection method. The method of assessment based on accounting books should be piloted in a focused manner among some industrial and commercial enterprises in the three cities of Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Baoji. However, regardless of the collection method, it must be based on the tax rate.

　　总结过去工作  沟通公私关系
    西北开二届税务会议
    拟定有关税收的八项具体办法，确定民主评议为今后主要征收方式。
    【新华社西安电】西北区第二届税务会议已于七月十八日到二十五日举行。出席会议的除西北五省一市的税局负责人员外，并邀请西安、宝鸡、南郑、兰州、天水、平凉、迪化、西宁、银川等主要城市的私营工商业代表三十余人参加。这对沟通公私关系，增进纳税人对国家税收政策的认识，起了很大作用。
    会议在批评和自我批评的精神下，总结和检查了过去的工作，并根据第二届全国税务会议的精神，讨论西北各地税收的调整问题，最后拟订了关于建立各县、市的税务复议委员会、工商业者的组织与管理等八项具体办法。会议一致认为：半年来西北的税收工作是有很大的成绩的；但在具体执行过程中尚存在很多缺点，如对税源的控制还做得不够，也没有很好地做到利商便民，若干税收干部作风生硬，同时缺乏深入的调查研究，因而在负担上存在着畸轻畸重的现象。
    出席会议的私营工商业代表对今后西北区的税收工作提出不少积极性的意见，同时也承认过去部分工商户隐瞒资产及营业状况的行为也是产生上述缺点的主要因素之一。对于中央此次调整税收的政策、措施和税收条例，工商界代表都感到满意，并表示今后要遵守法令规定，协助政府完成任务。
    会议对工商业税征收方法及税率与任务的关系问题曾展开了热烈的讨论，最后一致同意，在西北工商业户会计制度尚不健全的情况下，应以民主评议为主要的征收方法，查账计征的方法则有重点地从西安、兰州、宝鸡三个城市的部分工商业中首先开始试行。但不论何种征收方法，均必须依据税率征收。
