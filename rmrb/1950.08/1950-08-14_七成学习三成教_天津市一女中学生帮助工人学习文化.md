　　"Seventy Percent Learning, Thirty Percent Teaching"
　　——A Tianjin Middle School Girl Helps Workers Learn Culture
　　By Our Reporter Jin Feng

　　“We are, seventy percent learning, thirty percent teaching,” a Tianjin No. 1 Girls' Middle School student succinctly explains their efforts to help workers learn culture and how they, in turn, learn from the workers in the process of helping them.

　　An Honorable Undertaking

　　At No. 1 Girls' Middle School, helping workers learn culture has become an honorable undertaking. The teachers and students who serve as instructors at the workers' spare-time school attached to No. 1 Girls' Middle School are universally respected and envied throughout the school.

　　When the workers' spare-time school was first established, the principal of No. 1 Girls' Middle School called upon teachers and students to serve the workers with concrete actions. Fifty or so high school students signed up to participate in the teaching work at the workers' spare-time school. They divided themselves into twenty-odd groups, with two people jointly teaching each lesson. During class, one person would lecture, and the other would sit and listen. After class, they would ask the workers, "What are your opinions?" In this way, with a humble and cautious work attitude, they earned the trust of the workers from the very beginning.

　　Initial Difficulties

　　But initially, they had an abstract idea that everything about the workers was good. They did not fully understand that the workers were still laymen when it came to culture and needed their practical help. Therefore, in teaching, they followed the workers' lead everywhere, falling into a rather passive situation. Sometimes, certain workers liked to quibble over words. The teaching students did not point out the inappropriateness of that learning method but simply followed the workers around with a dictionary in hand. As a result, even though they worked hard to prepare the lessons, the workers still felt dissatisfied. Sometimes they taught too fast, and the workers offered suggestions. Then they taught more slowly, and the workers offered suggestions again. They felt a sense of helplessness.

　　Lessons Learned

　　As a result of these setbacks in actual teaching, they discovered that their idea of "purely learning from the workers" was one-sided, and their service perspective was vague. They initially realized that they should start by enriching themselves. In this way, bi-weekly faculty meetings were held regularly, where teaching experiences were exchanged. Teachers of the same grade and same course prepared lessons together, helping each other find supplementary materials and prepare teaching methods. They also carefully studied the characteristics of the workers, and teaching methods were also improved. For example, using calculations of daily and nightly work and the wages of male and female workers to replace "rabbits and chickens in the same cage" in arithmetic problems. Teaching the purpose of addition and subtraction before rigidly explaining the rules of addition and subtraction in elementary arithmetic. Reciting some popular literary works when teaching advanced elementary Chinese. As a result of doing so, the workers' interest and effectiveness in learning were significantly improved.

　　Learning from the Workers

　　Through the concrete teaching process, the students' "learning from the workers" changed from "subjective wishes" to "practical actions." First of all, the workers' patient help and earnest, frank attitude enabled them to gain a lot of practical knowledge. Once, a teacher said, "Religion has its disadvantages and also its advantages." The workers were anxious when they heard this, saying, "Don't promote religion to us, we don't believe in that." The workers have rich production knowledge and a learning method that is good at connecting theory with practice. Once, a teacher was talking about tunnels, and because she was unfamiliar, she had to cite the Moscow subway as an example. The workers who had worked as miners then explained in detail how to dig tunnels, how to ventilate them, and so on as a supplement. In this way, the teachers are the workers' teachers, and also the workers' students.

　　Helped Their Own Learning

　　The workers work about ten hours a day and still rush to study. Sometimes, to attend meetings or work overtime, they rush to class without eating. Sometimes, after class, they rush to work the night shift, staying up until dawn. Their tenacious and arduous learning spirit and work attitude directly motivated the students' learning. Seeing that the workers calculated and allocated their learning and labor time by the second, they felt that their own learning was still quite lax. Therefore, they gradually arranged their lives and studies, becoming more tense and orderly. They gradually learned to seize the time, and were also better able to find problems, grasp the key points, and connect with reality when studying. This made their learning more solid and in-depth than that of other students. This enabled them not only to avoid delaying their studies after teaching but also to achieve even greater success.

### “七成学习三成教”——天津市一女中学生帮助工人学习文化

　　“七成学习三成教”
    ——天津市一女中学生帮助工人学习文化
    本报记者  金凤
    “我们是，七成学习三成教”，天津市一女中学生这样概括地说明她们帮助工人学习文化以及她们在帮助工人学习中自己向工人们学习的情形。
    荣誉的事业
    在一女中，帮助工人学习文化已经成为一种荣誉的事业。担任了附设在一女中的工人业余学校教员的师生，受到全校普遍的尊敬和羡慕。
    当工人业余学校刚一开办，一女中校长号召师生们以具体行动，来为工人服务的时候，五十来个高中的学生，报名参加了工人业余学校的教学工作。她们分成了二十几个小组，每两个人共同教一堂功课；上课时一个人在上面讲，一个人坐在下面听；下课以后就问工人“有什么意见”。这样，她们以谦虚、谨慎的工作态度，一开始就赢得了工人们的信任。
    最初的困难
    但她们最初对于工人有着抽象的一切都好的想法。她们不十分了解工人对于文化还是外行，还需要她们切实帮助。因此，她们在教学上就处处跟着工人走，陷于相当被动的局面。有时，某些工人爱扣字眼，教课的学生不指出那种学习方法的不妥当，只是抱着一本字典跟着工人转。结果是自己准备功课尽管吃力，工人们仍然感觉不满足。有时她们教得快了，工人们提意见；她们就教慢些，工人们又提意见；她们就感到无所适从的苦恼。
    摸索到的经验
    在实际教学上碰了这些钉子的结果，她们发现自己的“纯粹要向工人学习”的想法有片面性，服务观点模糊。她们初步认清了应当从充实自己做起。这样，两星期一次的教员联席会定期举行了，在会上交流了教学经验；教同年级同一课程的在一起准备功课，互相帮忙找补充教材和准备教法。她们又仔细研究工人的特点，教学方法也有了改进。例如教算术四则题的用计算日、夜工和男、女工的工资来代替“鸡兔同笼”；教初年级算术时不死讲加、减法的法则而先讲加、减法的用途；教高小国语时朗诵一些通俗文艺作品。这样做的结果，显著地提高了工人学习的兴趣和效果。
    向工人学习
    通过了具体的教学过程，学生们的“向工人学习”就由“主观愿望”变成了“实际的行动”。首先是工人们的耐心帮助她们和认真坦白的态度，使她们增长了不少实际知识。有一次一个教员说到“宗教有它的坏处也有它的好处”，工人们一听就急了，说：“甭给我们宣传宗教，我们是不信这一套的。”工人们有着丰富的生产知识和善于联系实际的学习方法，有一次一个教员讲到隧道，因为不熟悉而不得不举出莫斯科的地下铁道来做例子的时候，做过矿工的工人们就详细地讲出怎样开凿隧道，怎样通风等等做为补充。这样，教员们是工人的先生，也是工人的学生。
    帮助了自己的学习
    工人们一天做工十小时左右，还一路赶来学习；有时为了开会或加班，顾不得吃饭就跑来上课；有时上了课以后，又赶忙去上夜班，一直顶到天明。他们那样顽强、艰苦的学习精神和劳动态度，更直接带动了学生们的学习。她们看到工人以分秒来计算和分配他们的学习和劳动的时间，她们就觉得自己的学习还是相当松懈，因此就逐渐安排她们的生活和学习，变得紧张、有秩序起来。她们逐渐学会抓紧时间，学习时也比较能发现问题，抓住重点和联系实际。这就使她们的学习，比别的同学来得踏实和深入。这就使她们在教书以后，非但没有耽误学习，反而学得更有成绩。
