　　“I have never seen such good police!”
    Comrade Wang Anxin writes to commend the Jing City People's Police

    Editor Comrade:
    Recently, Beijing has experienced heavy rains, causing significant water accumulation in some areas and frequent collapses of residential buildings. Under these circumstances, the Beijing People's Police have demonstrated a high degree of dedication to serving the people, heroically conducting rescue and protection work, and reducing the loss of life and property for the affected masses. On the night of July 17th, during a heavy rain, when residents' walls and houses collapsed, all officers of the 7th Police Station of the 1st Precinct braved the rain to inspect all streets and lanes under their jurisdiction. To accommodate those who suffered from wall and house collapses, they did not sleep all night. In the 16th room of Mingtang Courtyard, within the jurisdiction of the 10th Police Station of the 3rd Precinct, the collapse of a room injured a pregnant woman named Liu Gui. Upon receiving the report, police officers Chen Qiyuan and Chen Baorui braved the heavy rain to rush to the scene. They carried Liu Gui to the Workers' Clinic for treatment, but due to the severity of her injuries, the clinic could not treat her. The two officers then carried the injured woman to Enguang Hospital, but that hospital was also unable to treat her. Finally, they carried her to the National First Maternity Hospital, allowing Liu Gui to escape danger. Comrade Li Guoquan of the 3rd Police Station of the 4th Precinct led officers in helping the masses bail water and build dikes all night. The next day, despite their fatigue, they still went to the disaster area to express their condolences to the masses. Wei Xing, the director of the 9th Police Station, braved the rain and waded through the water to lead the masses in building dikes to block the water, ensuring the safety of the residents in the northern part of Dachuandian, and moved more than 30 women, children, and patients who had suffered from collapsed houses to Guanyin Street, cooking rice and boiling water for them. Liu Yuqin, Liu Xizhen, and all the officers of the 4th Police Station put forward the slogan "Don't let anyone be crushed to death!" and insisted on flood prevention and rescue work all night. Police officers such as Zhao Baoqi and Zheng Liangchen had their clothes soaked through, wrung them out and put them back on, and insisted on working in the water all night. Chen Jintang, an officer of the 14th Police Station, carried injured people to the hospital through the mud. Tong Fengqi and Ma Yijie, patrolling police officers of the 12th Police Station of the 5th Precinct, rescued an old lady who had fallen into a ditch in the heavy rain. All the officers of the 14th Police Station rushed to the homes of residents to help citizens dredge the accumulated water. The officers of the 4th Police Station of the Eastern Suburban Precinct rescued a girl who was injured by tree branches in the storm, notified her family, and transferred her to the hospital. The police officers of the 6th Police Station of the Mentougou Precinct checked and guarded the Yongding River embankment all night in the heavy rain.
    The Beijing People's Police, in order to safeguard the interests of the masses, carried out rescue and protection work day and night in the heavy rain, and were praised by the broad masses of citizens. For example, Old Lady Tang of 26 Lanman Hutong in the 4th Outer District personally went to the police station in charge of her area to express her thanks: "Fortunately, you took care of me, otherwise, I would have been crushed to death long ago!" Many people said: "Since I can remember, I have never seen such good police!"

　　“我还没有见过这样好的警察！”
    王安新同志来信表扬京市人民警察编者同志：
    北京市近来时降大雨，某些地区积水很多，居民房屋时有倒塌。在此情形下，北京市人民警察曾表现了高度为人民服务的精神，英勇地进行了抢救防护工作，减少了受灾群众生命财产的损失。七月十七日夜天降大雨，居民墙倒屋塌的时候，内一分局第七派出所全体干警冒雨出动到所属各街巷视察。为安置那些因墙倒屋塌而受难的人们，整整一夜未睡。内三分局第十派出所管界明堂大院十六号房间倒塌，将孕妇刘桂氏砸伤，派出所警士陈起元陈宝瑞据报后，冒着大雨赶到现场，当将刘桂氏抬往工人诊疗所医治，因伤重该所不能治疗，二人随又将该伤者改抬恩光医院，该院仍不能医治。复又抬送国立第一助产医院，使刘桂氏得以转危为安。外四分局第三派出所李国荃同志率领干警通宵帮助群众淘水、筑堤，第二天不顾疲劳，仍赴灾区慰问群众。第九派出所所长韦行冒雨涉水领导群众筑堤挡水，保证了大川淀北部居民的安全，并将因塌房受难的妇孺，病人三十余名搬到观音街，给他们煮饭烧水。第四派出所刘玉琴，干事刘熙贞及全体员警提出“不让砸死一个人”的口号，连夜坚持防水抢救工作。警士中如赵保琪、郑良臣的衣服湿透了，拧干又穿上，连夜在水中坚持工作。第十四派出所干事陈锦堂，泥泞中将受伤群众背往医院。外五分局第十二派出所巡逻警士佟凤岐、马益洁两人在大雨中营救了掉在水沟里的老太太。第十四派出所全所干警分头赶到各居民户帮助市民们疏通积水。东郊分局第四派出所干警在暴风雨中抢救了被树枝砸伤的女孩子，通知其家属并转送医院。门头沟分局第六派出所的警士们，大雨中连夜检查看护着永定河堤防。
    北京市人民警察为维护群众利益，大雨中不分昼夜的进行抢救防护工作，受到广大市民的赞扬。如外四区烂漫胡同二十六号的汤老太太亲自到该管派出所去道谢：“幸亏有你们照顾我，不然，我早就砸死了！”不少群众这样说：“自我能记事以来，还没有见过这么好的警察！”
