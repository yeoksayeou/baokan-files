Strive for Production and Thrift to Support Your Liberation of Taiwan
    Letter from Beijing Tram Workers to the People's Liberation Army

    Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army:
    The first "August 1st" Army Day since the founding of New China has arrived. The birth of New China is the brilliant achievement you attained after arduous struggle under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. You shed blood and sweat on the front lines to liberate the people of the whole country. Now, you are preparing to cross the sea and fight to liberate our compatriots in Taiwan.

    Looking back, the Kuomintang bandit troops oppressed the people and forced them to the point of desperation. Tram workers were simply their venting tools. Not only would they ride without buying tickets, but they would also grab someone and beat them up. After being beaten, there was nowhere to complain!

    Since the liberation of Beijing, for more than a year now, not a single tram worker has been beaten. At the same time, your sense of responsibility for the people's property is admirable. As veteran worker Liu Zhixiang said: "I have been with the tram company for more than 20 years, and I have never encountered such a reasonable army."

    In order to repay the Party for the happiness it has given us, and to thank you comrades for liberating us from our shackles, although we cannot go to the front lines to kill the enemy with our own hands, we are determined to support you with production and thrift in the rear, accelerate the liberation of Taiwan, and capture Chiang Kai-shek alive. We have already launched a production and thrift competition to complete 10,000 kilometers of safe driving and reduce electricity consumption per kilometer to below 0.90 degrees (currently reduced to 0.889 degrees) as the goal for launching a new record movement.

    Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army! We must unite as one under the banner of Mao Zedong, join hands, and strive to build a new China! We wish you good health!
        Beijing Tram Company Workers Han Zhenxing

### 努力生产节约支援你们解放台湾  京市电车工人致函解放军

　　努力生产节约支援你们解放台湾
    京市电车工人致函解放军亲爱的解放军同志们：
    新中国成立后的第一个“八一”建军节来到了。新中国的诞生，是你们在共产党、毛主席和朱总司令领导之下，经过了艰苦的斗争，而得来的辉煌成果。你们为了解放全国的人民，在前线上流血流汗。现在更为了解放台湾的同胞而准备渡海作战。
    回想过去国民党匪军，他们欺压人民，逼得老百姓走头无路。而电车上的工作人员，简直是他们的泄气工具，不但坐车不买票，更有的时候，揪过来就揍一阵，挨完打呀，连委屈都没地方诉！
    自北京解放后，到现在一年多的光景里，我们电车工作人员就没有一个人挨打。同时，你们对人民财产的负责精神，更使我们万分钦佩。正如老工友刘植祥说的：“我到电车公司二十多年了，就没遇见过这样讲理的队伍。”
    为了报答党给我们的幸福，为了答谢同志们解放了我们的束缚。我们虽然不能上前线亲手杀敌，可是我们在后方，坚决的要以生产节约来支援你们，加速的解放台湾，活捉蒋介石。目前我们已经展开了生产节约竞赛，要完成一万公里的安全行车和每公里用电突破○·九○度（目前已经减到○·八八九度），作为开展新纪录运动的奋斗目标。
    亲爱的解放军同志们！我们要在毛泽东旗帜下，团结成一块钢，携起手来，为建设新中国而奋斗！谨祝您们身体健康！
        北京市电车公司工人  韩振兴
