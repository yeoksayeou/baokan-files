　　Accepting Newspaper Criticism and Starting to Improve Work
    Letters from Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory and Xinhua Bookstore General Administration

    [This Newspaper] On July 28th, this newspaper (page 3) criticized the bureaucratic and事務istic work style of the administrative leading cadres of Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory, and the shortcomings of the factory's trade union. We have now received letters from Zhou Yongsheng, Director of Xinhua Printing Factory, and the General Administration of Xinhua Bookstore, stating that they fully accept the criticism, have conducted a comprehensive review of their work, and have formulated concrete measures to improve their work, which are now being implemented. This spirit of humbly accepting criticism is very good, but accepting criticism is only the beginning of correcting mistakes, and we hope that this spirit will be earnestly implemented in the work. The following are letters from Xinhua Printing Factory and Xinhua Bookstore General Administration:

   Letter from Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory to the Editor:

    After your newspaper published Comrade Lan Cun's criticism of us on July 28th, we have conducted a review. We believe that this is the newspaper's concern and love for our work.

    Our leadership style does indeed have serious bureaucratic and事務istic tendencies. The factory has developed rapidly during the recovery phase, growing from the original 250+ people to 700+ people, but the work has not kept up. The leadership has not clearly defined the division of labor and established systems, lacks specific assistance in production, and has not strengthened education for employees, and spends all day trapped in the circle of approving slips and employee loans.

    Due to the lack of separation between Party and administration, no one is specifically responsible for Party work, many problems within the Party have not been resolved in a timely manner, organizational life is lax, discipline is loose, the relationship between the Party and the masses is not close, the political level of Party members is low, and the Party has not formed a core leadership role in the factory. The Party's leadership over the trade union is also insufficient, resulting in the previous trade union being detached from the masses and allowing all kinds of work to drift along.

    In administration, there is a lack of sound work systems. The masses were not mobilized to discuss when assigning work, so it could not be thoroughly implemented; there was no follow-up inspection afterward, and deviations were not corrected, causing much work to stagnate. Material budgets are only formal, there is no fixed consumption of paper, and there is no inspection, resulting in serious waste of materials. This is our irresponsible behavior towards state property.

    Among the leading cadres, a clear division of labor and responsibility system has not been established. The result of everyone being responsible is that no one is responsible, and when problems arise, the person responsible cannot be found. The scope of work of the cadres who carry out the work below is not clear, so that the cadres cannot give full play to their initiative.

    The phenomenon of no planning in the entire production has formed. Although some objective circumstances have increased the difficulty of production management, the cadres managing production should bear the main responsibility for not actively thinking of ways to solve the problem. For example, problems such as reasonable division of labor in production, responsibility system, and tool management have been raised by workers many times, but the leadership has delayed them again and again, and the use of machines is still not fixed, and tools are discarded randomly.

    All of the above facts prove that we have committed serious bureaucratic and事務istic errors, and have neglected the use of criticism and self-criticism as a weapon, so that long-term errors cannot be corrected in a timely manner, and work cannot be improved.

    The newspaper's criticism of us is very correct. We fully accept it and have decided to start from the following aspects to initially improve our work:

    In terms of administration, the adjustment of the organizational structure has been approved by the higher authorities to reduce unnecessary levels. The factory director directly leads production, gradually establishes a responsibility system for administration and production, and a material saving reward system. The establishment of a factory management committee is also being prepared in mid-September to strengthen democratic management.

    The Party was made public on August 2nd, and the establishment of a general branch has been approved by the Municipal Party Committee. Four branches have been established according to production departments to strengthen the Party's guarantee and supervision of production tasks. The rectification movement will also be used to rectify the ideological style of Party members and Party member cadres, gradually improve the political level of Party members, improve the relationship between the Party and the masses, and strengthen the Party's discipline education.

    The trade union was re-elected on July 18th, and workshop committees were established according to production departments to assist the administration in completing production tasks.

    The entire factory is currently discussing the production plan, preparing to participate in the city's general call for a city-wide production competition, implementing the responsibility system, improving quality, and reducing costs, and using actions to respond to the newspaper's criticism of us.

     Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory Director Zhou Yongsheng
      August 25th

    Letter from the General Administration of Xinhua Bookstore to the Editor of People's Daily:

    Beijing Xinhua Printing Factory is a factory directly under our administration (formerly under the leadership of the Publishing Bureau of the General Administration of Publications). Our administration is also responsible for the many shortcomings existing in the factory's work, especially the shortcomings in leadership. A week ago, our administration organized an inspection team (including the responsible comrades of the factory) to reside in the factory to assist in the inspection work and study practical ways to improve the work. The inspection work has not yet been completed, and some reform measures are already underway.

    The problem of lack of planning in sending manuscripts is still a serious problem. This is directly related to the lack of planning in organizing manuscripts. In addition to sending fewer urgent items and paying attention to adjusting with reprinted books, it is currently necessary to strengthen the planning and accuracy of organizing manuscripts. The factory also needs to strengthen general affairs work to make the entire production as rational as possible.

　　接受报纸批评开始改进工作
    北京新华印刷厂、新华书店总管理处分别来函
    【本报讯】七月二十八日本报（第三版）曾对北京新华印刷厂行政领导干部中存在的官僚主义、事务主义作风，及该厂工会存在的缺点进行了批评；顷接新华印刷厂厂长周永生及新华书店总管理处分别来函，表示完全接受批评，对工作已作全面的检查，且已拟订出改进工作的具体办法，现正在执行中。这种虚心接受批评的精神是很好的，但接受批评仅是改正错误的开始，希望把这种精神切实贯彻到工作里去。下面是新华印刷厂及新华书店总管理处来函：
   北京新华印刷厂来函编辑同志：
    贵报七月二十八日发表记者蓝村同志对我们的批评后，我们已经进行了检讨，我们认为这是报纸对我们工作的关心和爱护。
    我们的领导作风，确实存在着严重的官僚主义和事务主义。工厂在恢复阶段中发展很快，从原有的二百五十余人发展到七百多人，但工作赶不上。领导上没有明确分工和建立制度，对生产方面缺少具体帮助，对职工没有加强教育，终日陷于批条子与职工借款等琐碎事务的圈子里不能自拔。
    由于党、政不分，党的工作没有专人负责，党内很多问题没有及时解决，组织生活散漫，纪律松弛，党群关系不密切，党员政策水平较低，党在工厂中未形成核心领导作用。党对工会的领导也很不够，致上届工会脱离群众，各种工作任其自流。
    在行政上，缺乏有健全的工作制度，布置工作时没有发动群众讨论，以致不能深入贯彻；事后又没有检查，发生偏向也未纠正，使许多工作停顿下来。材料预算仅具形式，纸张没有一定的消耗量，没有检查，造成材料的严重浪费，这是我们对国家财产不负责的表现。
    在领导干部间，没有建立明确的分工负责制，大家都负责的结果是都不负责，出了问题找不到应负责任的人。对下面执行工作的干部，没有明确其工作范围，使干部不能发挥其主动性。
    形成整个生产无计划的现象，虽然有些客观情况增加了生产管理上的困难，但管理生产的干部没有积极想办法，则应负主要责任。如生产中的合理分工、负责制、工具管理等问题，工人虽多次提出，领导上却一拖再拖，至今机器使用仍不固定，工具乱丢。
    以上这一系列事实，都证明我们犯了严重的官僚主义和事务主义的错误，并且忽视了批评与自我批评这一武器的运用，因而长时期的错误不能及时纠正，工作也无法提高。
    报纸对我们的批评是很正确的，我们完全接受，并决定从下列几方面着手，初步改进工作：
    在行政方面，已经上级批准，调整组织机构，减少不必要的层次。厂长直接领导生产，逐步建立行政与生产上的责任制及材料节约奖励制，并准备在九月中成立工厂管理委员会，加强民主化的管理。
    党在八月二日公开，业经市委批准成立总支，按生产部门成立四个支部，加强党对生产任务的保证与监督。并将通过整风运动，整顿党员与党员干部的思想作风，逐步提高党员的政治水平，改善党群关系，加强党的纪律教育。
    工会已于七月十八日改选，并按生产部门成立车间委员会，以便协助行政完成生产任务。
    目前全厂正讨论生产计划，准备参加市总号召的全市生产大竞赛，贯彻责任制，提高质量，减低成本，用行动来答复报纸对我们的批评。
     北京新华印刷厂  厂长周永生
      八月二十五日
    新华书店总管理处来函人民日报社编辑同志：
    北京新华印刷厂是我处直属工厂（过去由出版总署出版局领导），该厂工作上存在着的许多缺点，尤其是领导上的缺点，我处也要负责。在一星期前，我处组织了一个检查小组（包括厂的负责同志），驻厂协助检查工作，并研究切实改进工作的办法。现在检查工作还未完毕，部分改革措施已在进行。
    发稿方面缺乏计划性的问题，直到现在还是一个严重问题。这是与组织稿件的计划性不足直接有关的，除少发急件并注意用重版书调节外，目前还需要加强组织稿件的计划性与准确性。工厂方面也需要加强工务工作，使整个生产尽可能合理化。
   新华书店总管理处  八月二十六日
