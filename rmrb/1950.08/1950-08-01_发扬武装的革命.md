　　Promote Armed Revolution
　　Guo Moruo

　　The Great Revolution of 1926-1927 achieved brilliant successes in its initial stages. It decimated the forces of old warlords such as Wu Peifu, Sun Chuanfang, and Zhang Zuolin in a destructive manner, causing Wu and Sun's major warlord factions to collapse with a single blow. In less than a year, it liberated more than half of China. At that time, the Chinese revolution appeared very promising.

　　The rapid development of revolutionary forces was mainly due to the leadership of the Communist Party. In 1924, the nascent Communist Party cooperated with the already declining Kuomintang. Although the Kuomintang, which was larger in number, was nominally in a leadership position, in reality, the Communist Party played the core role in driving all revolutionary work.

　　Without the participation of the Communist Party and without the help of the Soviet Union, it would have been impossible to establish a revolutionary base in Guangdong in the first place. After the launch of the Northern Expedition, within the army, the Independent Regiment led by Ye Ting was the Red Army of China at the time, possessing exemplary combat effectiveness, and it defeated Wu Peifu, the head of the Northern warlords, upon its first engagement. The political work in the army was mainly undertaken by Communist Party members or left-wing revolutionaries. The army with such progressive elements demonstrated considerable achievements in combat. Outside the army, the labor unions, peasant associations, student youth, and women's organizations that assisted military operations were all led by the Communist Party. Even the local party branches of the Kuomintang, due to the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, were mostly led by Communist Party members. Thus, due to the leadership of the Communist Party, the revolutionary military operations achieved extremely brilliant victories.

　　The reactionaries had consistently played a neutralizing role within the revolutionary camp. When the revolutionary forces were surging, the neutralizing effect was suppressed. However, since Chiang Kai-shek openly betrayed the revolution, usurped the fruits of the revolution, and represented the comprador class and the landlord class in collusion with imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries frantically crushed the revolutionary forces in the name of "purging the party," destroying all progressive mass organizations, causing the revolutionary forces to suffer a great setback.

　　Under such circumstances, the armed revolutionary forces had to clearly separate themselves from the armed counter-revolutionary forces. This is the historical significance of the August 1st Uprising of 1927. It is very consistent with the historical development process to regard "August 1st" as the birth date of the armed revolutionary forces. However, just like the birth of an individual, there is a period of existence in the womb or eggshell before birth, the armed revolutionary forces of China were in fact already being nurtured before "August 1st."

　　After twenty-three years of long and arduous struggle, the armed revolutionary forces have grown unprecedentedly, and the Chinese revolution has achieved brilliant success. The celebration of "August 1st," the birth of the armed revolutionary forces, is indeed worth celebrating. But we must continue our efforts, maintain the spirit of hard struggle of the past twenty-three years, make our armed revolutionary forces more refined, more modern, and more rational, to complete the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people.

　　Tibet will be liberated, no problem. Taiwan will be liberated, no problem. The American imperialists are arrogantly invading our Taiwan with armed forces, attempting to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan. That is the self-digging grave of American imperialism.

　　The American imperialists' ambition for aggression in Asia is grand enough. Especially towards our China, they have deployed a long snake formation at sea, trying to blockade us, starting from South Korea, through Japan, the Ryukyus, Taiwan, the Philippines, all the way to Vietnam. At both ends of this long snake formation, they have also selected two landing points, namely Korea and Vietnam. Therefore, this long snake is obviously still a vicious two-headed snake. However, the northern head of this snake has been struck almost to pieces by the iron hammer of the Korean people. We believe that the southern head of this snake will also be smashed to pieces sooner or later by the iron hammer of the Vietnamese people.

　　Our commemoration of "August 1st" today reminds us of a current task, which is to cut off the body of this poisonous snake in the middle in the liberation of Taiwan!

　　"Armed revolution against armed counter-revolution," this meaning has been further expanded today. Previously, it was a domestic scale within China, but now it is an international scale of united struggle of all Asian people. Today is the "armed revolution" of all Asian people against the "armed counter-revolution" led by American imperialism.

　　Our responsibility is even greater. In order to defend China, to defend Asia, and to defend world peace, we must promote our armed revolution to crush the aggression of imperialism.

　　发扬武装的革命
    郭沫若
    一九二六——一九二七年的大革命、在初期是获得了很辉煌的成就的。摧枯拉朽般地摧毁了吴佩孚、孙传芳、张作霖等旧军阀的武力，使吴孙两大军阀一蹶不振，不足一年的期间便解放了大半个中国。在当时中国的革命是显示得很有希望的。
    革命势力得到这样迅速的发展，主要是由于共产党的领导。一九二四年，新生的共产党和已经衰朽了的国民党合作，在数量上占多数的国民党，在形式上虽然处在领导地位，但在事实上所有一切的革命工作是由共产党在起着推动的核心作用。
    没有共产党的参加，没有苏联的帮助，在广东要建立一个革命的根据地，首先便是不可能的。在北伐军发动以后，在军队里面，有叶挺所领导的独立团，是当时中国的红军，具有模范的战斗力，一出马便把北洋军阀的头子吴佩孚打垮了。军队中的政治工作，主要是由共产党员或左翼的革命分子在担任，有这种进步成份的军队在作战上也就表示了相当的成绩。在军队之外，协助军事行动的工会、农会、学生青年妇女的组织都是共产党在领导；就是国民党的地方各级党部，因为国共合作的关系，领导者也多是共产党员。就这样，由于有共产党的领导，故革命的军事行动得到了极其辉煌的胜利。
    反动派在革命阵营中始终是起着对消作用的。在革命势力高涨的时候，对消作用是被压抑着了。但自蒋介石公开叛变，篡取了革命的果实，代表着买办阶级和地主阶级而与帝国主义勾通的国民党反动派，便四处以“清党”为名，疯狂地摧残革命势力，破坏一切进步的民众组织，使革命势力受到很大的挫折。
    在这样的情势之下，武装的革命力量便不能不和武装的反革命力量明确地分划开来。这就是一九二七年八一革命的历史意义。以“八一”为武装的革命力量的诞生日是很合乎历史发展的程序的。但就和一个个体的诞生、在诞生之前已有在母胎中或蛋壳中的一段存在的一样，中国的武装的革命力量在“八一”之前事实上是已经孕育着的。
    经过二十三年的长期苦斗，武装的革命力量已经空前壮大，中国的革命已经获得了辉煌的成功，“八一”这一武装的革命力量的圣诞，实在值得庆贺。但我们要再接再厉，保持着二十三年来的坚苦奋斗的精神，使我们的武装的革命力量更加精粹，更加近代化、合理化，来完成我们中国人民革命事业。
    西藏是要解放的，不成问题。台湾是要解放的，不成问题。美帝国主义狂妄地以武装侵略我们的台湾，企图阻挠我们对于台湾的解放，那是美帝国主义的自掘坟墓。
    美帝国主义对于亚洲的侵略，野心倒是够宏大的。特别是对于我们中国，它在海上布了一条长蛇阵，想来封锁我们，从南朝鲜起，经由日本、琉球、台湾、菲律宾，一直到越南。在这条长蛇阵的两端还选好了两个登陆地点，即朝鲜与越南。因此，这条长蛇很明显地还是一条毒狠的两头蛇呢。然而这条蛇的北头已经在朝鲜人民的铁槌之下，打得快要粉碎了。这条蛇的南头，我们相信，在越南人民的铁槌之下，也早迟会打成粉碎的。
    我们今天来纪念“八一”就提醒了我们一项当前的任务，便是在解放台湾上，要把这条毒蛇的身子拦腰斩断！
    “武装的革命反对武装的反革命”，这意义在今天已经更加扩大了。以前是中国一国的国内规模，现在是全亚洲人民团结奋斗的国际规模了。今天是全亚洲人民的“武装的革命”反对美帝国主义所领导的“武装的反革命”。
    我们的责任是更加重大了，为了保卫中国，为了保卫亚洲，为了保卫世界和平，我们必须发扬我们的武装的革命，以粉碎帝国主义的侵略。
