Xinhua News Agency, 14th. The People's Republic of China People's Delegation, headed by Guo Moruo and Li Lisan, departed from Beijing for Korea on the 11th. The delegation consists of 21 representatives from various people's organizations, democratic parties, and ethnic minorities, along with two secretaries, totaling 23 people. The delegation's mission is to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the liberation of the Korean people on "August 15th," to express sympathy to the Korean people who are victoriously fighting the war against America, and to deeply thank the Korean people for their past assistance to the Chinese revolution. The delegation carries two banners presented to General Kim Il-sung and the Korean People's Army, as well as medicines, films, letters of sympathy, etc.

Before the delegation's departure, all circles in Beijing held a grand farewell rally at the railway station. Those present included Chen Shutong, Shen Junru, and Shi Liang, representatives of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Huang Yanpei and Luo Longji, representatives of the Government Administration Council; Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing; and Shao Lizi, Zhang Bojun, Ma Xulun, Liu Ningyi, Deng Yingchao, Feng Wenbin, Shen Yanbing, Li Siguang, Tao Menghe, Zhu Kezhen, Xiao Ming, and other representatives from various democratic parties and people's organizations, totaling more than 1,500 people. Huang Yanpei, Deputy Premier of the Government Administration Council, delivered a farewell speech, saying: The Chinese and Korean people have thousands of years of friendship. Today, in the struggle to resist American imperialist aggression, the entire Chinese people are concerned about the victory of the Korean people every day. He hoped that the delegation would convey the warm sympathy and high respect of the entire Chinese people to the Korean people. Shi Liang then spoke, pointing out: While the American imperialists are aggressing against Korea, they are also openly aggressing against our country's territory, Taiwan. This shows that the American imperialists are the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people. Therefore, the victory of the Korean people is also the victory of our Chinese people. Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and Director of the Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea, said: I hope that the delegation will bring the admiration and high respect of our Chinese working class and the Chinese people to all the Korean brothers and sisters, and tell them that the 500 million people of China resolutely stand behind them to win our common victory. Deng Yingchao, Vice Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, said: We extend infinite concern and sympathy to the peaceful Korean people, women, and children who have suffered barbaric bombing and slaughter by the American imperialists. We Chinese women are willing to do everything in our power to support the Korean people's struggle for national reunification and independence. Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Xiao Ming, Director of the Beijing People's Committee Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea, also spoke.

Finally, Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese People's Delegation, delivered a reply, saying: "This time we go, we must wholeheartedly represent all the Chinese people, pay tribute to the Korean people, pay tribute to the Korean People's Army, and pay tribute to General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people! At the same time, we must convey to the Korean people the iron will of the Chinese people: no matter what obstruction the extremely vicious American imperialists create, we must liberate Taiwan and all the territory of China, we must support the just war of the Korean people, and support the revolutionary movement of all Asian people for independence and liberation."

The farewell rally ended in warm applause and shouts of "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!"

Li Zhouyuan, Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, and Counselor Cui Yingzeng led the embassy staff to the railway station to see them off and presented flowers to the delegation.
