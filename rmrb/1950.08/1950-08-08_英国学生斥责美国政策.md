    The "Oxford Union Debate" on June 1st passed a resolution by 224 votes to 179, expressing regret over the influence exerted by the United States on other countries.
    Churchill's son, Randolph Churchill, opposed the proposal and was repeatedly interrupted by many angry voices. At times, Randolph Churchill's voice was drowned out by the clamor of the crowd.
    Professor Joad initiated the meeting, saying: Many countries are heading for disaster, and the United States is driving them in that direction.
