Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The China Peace Committee has issued a notice to all people's organizations regarding the expansion of the peace signature campaign. The full text is as follows: Since the beginning of May, the number of people nationwide who have signed the peace declaration, according to incomplete statistics, has exceeded 50 million. Our country's peace signature campaign has already made an important contribution to the world peace movement. However, our country's peace signature campaign still basically remains within the scope of organized masses and large cities. In order to further expand the peace signature campaign, in order to attract the vast people of hundreds of millions in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas to the struggle to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression, this movement must continue to be expanded. Now, American imperialism has carried out armed aggression against our neighbor, Korea, and our territory, Taiwan. Under these circumstances, it is even more necessary to strengthen the Chinese people's struggle against wars of aggression and to defend world peace. Therefore, we should, on the existing basis, further carry out in-depth propaganda work among the population of men, women, old and young, in urban and rural areas across the country, closely combine the peace signature campaign with the struggle against American aggression, and strive for 150 million to 200 million people to sign the declaration for the defense of peace.

    In order to make the signature campaign more planned, we propose the following signature numbers as the goal of the signature campaign to the leaders of the peace movement in each major administrative region, based on local conditions:
    East China Region: 55 million
    Central and South China Region: 40 million
    North China Region: 35 million
    Northeast China Region: 25 million
    Southwest China Region: 20 million
    Northwest China Region: 5 million

    We hope that the people's organizations in each major administrative region will formulate more detailed plans based on this. We must strive for the complete signature of organized masses, and vigorously carry out the work of collecting signatures from the vast unorganized masses and peasants in small and medium-sized cities and rural areas.

    Regarding the working methods for completing this task, we suggest the following:

    (1) All people's organizations across the country should immediately mobilize and devote all their efforts to this work. Trade unions should mobilize workers to sign through local trade unions and industrial unions. In all large, medium and small cities with trade union organizations, the signature campaign should be widely launched among workers, striving for the majority of workers and their families nationwide to sign the declaration for the defense of peace. The Communist Youth League, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation should give full play to the enthusiasm of young people. The All-China Students' Federation should use the summer vacation to unite teachers to organize peace signature propaganda teams or work teams to go deep into all youth groups in organized and unorganized small and medium-sized cities and villages to carry out propaganda and mobilization work, and strive for the majority of young people and children to participate in the signature. The All-China Women's Federation should strive for the majority of women and children across the country to participate in the signature, and strive for women to account for more than one-third of the total number of signatures. The troops should strive to complete the signature of all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army before the end of August, and mobilize the soldiers, especially the staff, to participate in the work of collecting signatures among the residents. In terms of peasant associations, peasant association organizations at all levels should mobilize and organize activists in rural areas, unite with other local organizations, and strive for more than one-half of the peasants nationwide to participate in the signature. Illiterate people, with their consent, can ask someone to sign on their behalf or draw a cross or fingerprint.

    (2) Conduct full propaganda and mobilization work in the signature campaign, expose the ferocity and outward strength but inward weakness of American imperialism, explain the strength of the world peace and democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, and explain that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, the Korean people will surely achieve victory, and the imperialist aggressors and their running dogs will inevitably fail. In propaganda, flexibly use various methods familiar and loved by the masses to enable the vast masses, especially rural peasants, to consciously participate in the signature.

    (3) Pay attention to summarizing the experience of the signature campaign at any time. Promote and commend successful experiences and the activities of activists in newspapers, magazines, wall newspapers, blackboard newspapers, and radio broadcasts at any time to promote the entire signature work.

    It is hoped that all localities will be able to submit a summary of the signature work to the Beijing Peace Committee before mid-September. The statistics of the number of signatures, the most representative signature booklets, as well as the most representative photos, paintings, works, letters, charts, texts, etc. about the peace signature campaign, should be notified to the Beijing Peace Committee by the fastest method before mid-September. The above-mentioned important materials will be brought to the Second Congress of the World Peace Congress in October by the Chinese delegation attending the congress for reporting and exhibition.

　　我国和大通知各人民团体
    号召扩大和平签名运动  争取两万万人参加签名
    【新华社十三日讯】中国保卫世界和平大会顷发出关于扩大征集和平签名工作给各人民团体的通知，全文如下：自五月初以来，全国人民在和平宣言上签名的人数，据不完全统计，已在五千万人以上。我国的和平签名运动对于世界保卫和平运动已有了重要的贡献。但是，我国的和平签名运动至今基本上仍停留在有组织群众和大城市的范围之内。为了更加扩大和平签名运动，为了把全国几万万中小城镇和农村的广大人民吸引到保卫世界和平反对侵略战争的斗争中来，这一运动必须继续加以扩大。现在美帝国主义已对我国邻邦朝鲜和我国领土台湾实行武装侵略，在这种情形下，加强中国人民反对侵略战争和保卫世界和平的斗争，尤为必要。因此，我们应当在现有的基础上，进一步在全国城乡男女老少的人口中展开深入的宣传工作，把和平签名运动和反对美国侵略的斗争密切地结合起来，争取一万万五千万至两万万人在保卫和平宣言上签名。
    为了使签名运动更带计划性，我们根据各地的条件，向各大行政区保卫世界和平运动的领导者们提议将如下的签名人数作为签名运动的努力目标：
    华东区五千五百万
    中南区四千万
    华北区三千五百万
    东北区二千五百万
    西南区二千万
    西北区五百万
    我们希望各大行政区的人民团体据此制定更详细的计划。必须争取有组织的群众全部签名，并大力向中小城市和农村中的广大无组织群众和农民展开征集签名的工作。
    关于完成这一任务的工作方法，我们建议如下：
    （一）全国各人民团体立即动员起来，全力进行这一工作。工会通过各地方工会和各产业工会，发动工人签名。凡有工会组织的各大中小城市地区，在工人中间普遍展开签名工作，争取全国工人及其家属的大多数在保卫和平宣言上签名。青年团、青联和学联充分发挥青年的积极性。学联利用暑假，联合教员组织和平签名宣传队或工作队，深入到有组织和无组织的中小城市和乡村中的一切青年群众中去进行宣传动员工作，争取大多数青年和少年儿童参加签名。妇联争取全国大多数妇女和儿童参加签名，并争取签名总人数中有三分之一以上的妇女。部队争取在八月底以前完成全国人民解放军全体指战员签名，并动员部队的战士特别是工作员参加居民中的征集签名的工作。农会方面，各级农会组织，动员和组织农村中的积极分子，联合当地的其他组织，争取占全国二分之一以上的农民参加签名。不识字的人经本人同意可以请人代签或画十字、捺手印。
    （二）在签名运动中进行充分的宣传鼓动工作，揭露美帝国主义的穷凶极恶和外强中干，说明以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量的强大，说明中国人民一定要解放台湾，朝鲜人民一定能取得胜利，帝国主义侵略者及其走狗必然失败。在宣传中灵活地运用为群众所熟悉和爱好的各种方式，使广大群众特别是乡村农民群众自觉地参加签名。
    （三）注意随时总结签名运动的经验。随时把成功的经验和积极分子的活动在报纸、杂志、墙报、黑板报、广播中加以推广和表扬，来推动整个的签名工作。
    希望各地在九月中旬以前能作出签名工作的总结送到北京保卫和平大会委员会。签名人数统计，最有代表性的签名册，以及最有代表性的关于和平签名运动的照片、绘画、作品、信件、图表、文字等，希望在九月中旬以前用最快的方法通知北京保卫世界和平大会委员会。上述重要资料都将由出席十月中世界保卫和平大会第二次代表大会的中国代表团带到大会上报告和展览。
