　　Warning MacArthur
    MacArthur, who is implementing the U.S. imperialist policy of armed aggression in the Far East, rushed to Taiwan on July 31 to discuss with the bandit Chiang how to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and then rushed back to Tokyo on August 1. The hasty actions of the imperialist robber MacArthur prove how panicked the U.S. imperialist robbers are in the face of the great victory of the people of the Far East.
    The U.S. imperialist act of armed aggression against Taiwan has long been anticipated by the world. When MacArthur left Taiwan, he issued a statement saying that "the policy that the island of Taiwan, including the Penghu Islands, should not be subjected to military attacks under the present circumstances has been announced, and the implementation of this policy is my responsibility and firm purpose." This only proves that U.S. imperialism is preparing to openly and militarily occupy our territory of Taiwan, and the one responsible for implementing this U.S. aggressive policy is none other than the notorious warmonger MacArthur. He suppresses the people's democratic movement in Japan, supports reactionary forces, condones war criminals, and re-arms Japan. He commanded the U.S. military to attack Korea, ordered U.S. aircraft to indiscriminately bomb peaceful cities in Korea, and massacred large numbers of peaceful residents. Now, he is personally commanding the U.S. Seventh Fleet and the U.S. Air Force, as well as the remnants of the Chiang bandit troops, to prevent the Chinese People's Liberation Army from liberating Taiwan. All of this shows the U.S. imperialist plot to expand the war of aggression in Asia, attempting to conquer the people of Asia by force, and also shows that U.S. imperialism and its plot implementer, MacArthur, are the common enemy of the people of Asia.
    The boastful MacArthur bragged: "Effective liaison methods between the U.S. forces under my command and the Chinese government forces (i.e., the Chiang bandit army) have been completed. If the hostile forces are foolish enough to attempt to launch an offensive, we will be able to respond effectively." Our people have never flinched because of the intimidation of U.S. imperialism; people know that the independence and freedom we enjoy today came precisely under the constant intimidation and large-scale armed intervention of U.S. imperialism. Foreign Minister Zhou pointed out in his statement on June 28: "The Chinese people, who defeated Japanese imperialism and the U.S. imperialist running dog Chiang Kai-shek, will surely victoriously expel the U.S. aggressors and recover Taiwan and all territories belonging to China." This sentence represents the firm will of all the Chinese people. MacArthur and his ilk failed to see the heroic and fearless spirit displayed by the Chinese people in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation, and failed to recognize the invincible strength of the Chinese people, which is pitifully foolish. MacArthur and his ilk, when the U.S. aggressive forces have been basically eliminated on the Chinese mainland, and recently suffered a great defeat in Korea, still believe that the U.S. imperialist warships, airplanes, and the remnants of the Chiang bandits who fled from the mainland to isolated islands can scare the Chinese people, prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and save the Chiang Kai-shek gang from their final doom, which only shows that they are incurable fools.
    Taiwan, once ruled by Japan, is a part of Chinese territory, just as the Northeast, once ruled by Japan, is Chinese territory; the Chinese people have every right to liberate and will surely liberate Taiwan, just as the Chinese people have every right to liberate and have already liberated the Northeast. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will surely victoriously annihilate the remaining Chiang bandit troops, victoriously expel MacArthur and his ilk of U.S. aggressors, and allow the people of Taiwan to see the light of day again.

### 警告麦克阿瑟

　　警告麦克阿瑟
    在远东执行美帝国主义武装侵略政策的麦克阿瑟，于七月三十一日匆匆赶往台湾，和蒋贼商量如何阻止中国人民解放台湾，又匆匆在八月一日赶回东京去。帝国主义强盗麦克阿瑟的行色如此慌张，证明在远东人民的伟大胜利面前，美帝国主义强盗是显得多么的仓皇失措。
    美帝国主义武装侵略台湾的行为，早已在世人预料之中。麦克阿瑟离开台湾时发表了一个声明，说什么“关于台湾本岛包括澎湖在内，在目前情况下，不得遭受军事进攻之政策业经宣布，是项政策之执行，即为余之责任与坚决之目的”。这只是证明美帝国主义准备公开武装侵占我国的领土台湾，而负责执行美国这一侵略政策的，正是早已臭名昭彰的战争贩子麦克阿瑟。他在日本镇压人民民主运动，扶植反动势力，纵容战犯，重新武装日本。他指挥美军进攻朝鲜，在朝鲜令美国飞机滥炸和平城市，大批屠杀和平的居民。现在又要亲自指挥美国第七舰队及美国空军，以及蒋匪残余部队，阻止中国人民解放军解放台湾。这一切说明了美帝国主义阴谋在亚洲扩大侵略战争，要想以暴力征服亚洲人民的罪恶企图，也说明了美帝国主义及其阴谋的实行者麦克阿瑟是亚洲人民的公敌。
    大言不惭的麦克阿瑟吹嘘道：“余统率下之美军与中国政府军队（即蒋匪军）间之有效联系办法业已完成，敌对力量倘愚蠢到企图发动攻势，则吾人当更能作有效之应付。”我国人民从来没有因为美帝国主义的恫吓而畏缩过；人们都知道，我们今天所享受的独立自由，正是在美帝国主义的不断恫吓和大规模武装干涉之下得来的。周外长在六月二十八日发表的声明中指出：“战胜了日本帝国主义和美国帝国主义走狗蒋介石的中国人民，必能胜利地驱逐美国侵略者，收复台湾和一切属于中国的领土。”这句话代表了全中国人民的坚决意志。麦克阿瑟之流未能看到中国人民在八年的抗日战争和四年的解放战争中所表现的英勇无畏的精神，未能认识到中国人民的不可战胜的力量，那才是愚蠢得可怜。麦克阿瑟之流在美国侵略势力在中国大陆上已基本肃清，最近在朝鲜又大失败时，还以为美帝国主义的军舰，飞机，以及从大陆上溃逃孤岛的蒋匪的残兵败将便能吓倒中国人民，便能阻止中国人民解放台湾，便能够挽救蒋家匪帮的最后灭亡的命运，那就只能显示出他们是无可救药的蠢才罢了。
    曾被日本统治的台湾是中国领土的一部分。如同曾被日本统治的东北是中国的领土一样；中国人民有完全的权利解放并必将解放台湾，如同中国人民有完全的权利解放并早已解放了东北一样。中国人民解放军一定能胜利地消灭蒋匪残余军队，胜利地驱逐麦克阿瑟之流的美国侵略者，使台湾同胞重见天日。
