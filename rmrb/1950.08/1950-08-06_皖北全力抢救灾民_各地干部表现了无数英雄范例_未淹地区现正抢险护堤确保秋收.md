Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th—After the Huai River dike broke in mid-July, causing a flood in the Anhui North region, the Anhui North Administrative Office and the Anhui North District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately took emergency measures. In severely affected areas, the first priority was to mobilize boats to rescue disaster victims. The second was to distribute a portion of emergency relief grain to provide immediate assistance to disaster victims. As of late July, 10.06 million jin of this grain had been allocated. At the same time, a large number of late autumn seeds are being prepared to be distributed to disaster victims for replanting after the flood recedes; areas that cannot be replanted will be considered for long-term production and disaster relief. The Anhui North Administrative Office has also been transporting back various late autumn seeds purchased with the assistance of provinces such as Hebei, Henan, and Shandong. In the undammed areas along the Huai River, efforts are being made to protect the dikes to ensure the autumn harvest, in order to reduce the development of the disaster.

Currently, all regions are fully implementing the above arrangements. The Anhui North Administrative Office and the Anhui North District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have implemented joint offices. In addition to individual leading personnel staying behind to preside over the unified command of flood prevention and disaster relief, other responsible personnel have led work teams deep into the disaster areas to help and organize disaster victims to carry out production for self-salvation. In the flooded areas, leading cadres at all levels from the special zone to the county and district have personally engaged in disaster relief and rescue work; in the undammed sections, government cadres are leading the masses to guard and patrol day and night, regardless of wind or rain. The Anhui North District Working Committee of the New Democratic Youth League has also issued instructions to the Youth League committees in various regions, calling for flood prevention and rescue to be the central task of the Youth League at present, and immediately mobilize Youth League members to participate in this movement under the unified leadership of the government. The Preparatory Committee of the Anhui North District Women's Federation also called for the mobilization and organization of women to participate in flood prevention. Tens of thousands of local garrison troops have also been put into dike protection, flood prevention, and rescue work. The directly affiliated organs of Anhui North are carrying out a "one liang of rice" movement to save on expenses and provide relief to disaster victims.

In the rescue, cadres in various regions demonstrated countless heroic examples. For example, Wang Qiyun, the township head of Wang Jieliu Township in Huoqiu County, was over sixty years old. When the Huai River dike broke, everyone else ran away in fear, but he immediately sat at the breach, using his body to block the Huai River, which moved others to return and rescue, ultimately reducing the losses of residents in the area. In some areas, after being flooded, cadres swam to rescue disaster victims; those who could not swim used the buoyancy of bamboo poles to cross the deep water to rescue. Many cadres encouraged each other during the rescue, saying: "We talk about serving the people all day long, now is an important moment to test us!"

　　皖北全力抢救灾民
    各地干部表现了无数英雄范例
    未淹地区现正抢险护堤确保秋收
    【新华社上海四日电】皖北区于七月中旬因淮河堤防溃决而酿成水灾后，皖北行署和中共皖北区党委已立即采取紧急措施。在重灾地区，首先是动员船只抢救灾民。其次是发放一部急赈粮，急救灾民。到七月下旬为止，此项粮食，已拨放一千零六万斤。同时，并准备大批晚秋种籽以待水退后发给灾民补种；不能补种的地区则作长期生产救灾的打算。皖北行署并已将平原、河北、河南、山东等省协助代购的各种晚秋种籽，陆续运回。在淮河沿岸未淹地区，则正在尽力抢险保堤，确保秋收，以减少灾情的发展。
    现各地正根据上述布署全力贯彻中。皖北行署和中共皖北区党委已实行联合办公，除个别领导人员留守机关主持防汛救灾统一指挥外，其他各负责人员均已率领工作队深入灾区帮助和组织灾民进行生产自救。在已淹地区，从专区到县、区各级领导干部，都亲身投入救灾抢险工作；未淹地段，人民政府干部正领导群众不分风雨昼夜全力守护巡逻。新民主主义青年团皖北区工作委员会亦已向各地团委发出指示信，号召把防汛抢险作为目前团的中心任务，立即动员团员在政府统一领导下，投入这一运动。皖北区妇联筹委会亦号召动员与组织妇女参加到防汛中去。当地警备部队数万人亦投入护堤防汛抢险工作。皖北直属机关正开展节约救灾的“一两米”运动，救济灾民。
    在抢险中，各地干部表现了无数的英雄范例。如霍邱县王截溜乡乡长王启云已六十多岁，当淮河堤破时别人都吓跑了，但他却即时坐在决口处，以身体挡住淮水，感动了别人又跑回来抢救，终使这一带居民减少了损失。有些地区被水淹后，干部们便泅水抢救灾民；有的不会泅水的，则借助竹竿的浮力渡过深水去抢救。许多干部在抢险中互相勉励说：“我们成天说为人民服务，现在正是考验我们的重要关头！”
