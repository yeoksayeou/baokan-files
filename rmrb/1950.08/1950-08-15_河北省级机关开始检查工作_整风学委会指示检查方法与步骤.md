　　Hebei Provincial Organs Begin Inspection Work
    Rectification Study Committee Instructs on Inspection Methods and Steps
    [This Dispatch] The Hebei Provincial Party and Mass Organization System organs have begun inspection work. To this end, the Provincial Rectification Study Committee has issued specific instructions regarding the steps and methods of inspection: Generally, inspection work will begin on August 6th and end on August 27th; the first two weeks will be devoted to comprehensive inspection and summary work, and the last week will be used to resolve key personnel and issues. The inspection method starts with inspecting and summarizing work, and through inspecting and summarizing work, addresses individual ideological, viewpoint, stance, and methodological problems in order to achieve the goal of improving work. Any method of inspecting thought that is divorced from practical work, isolated, and empty will not achieve good results. Therefore, it is necessary to: First, at the beginning of the inspection, the person in charge of a unit, a department, or a section should first make a self-criticism and summary report on the situation of the unit, and then conduct a full discussion. And link it with each person's work review. Second, when inspecting and summarizing work, formalism that is all-encompassing should be prevented; the central link should be grasped according to the specific situation of the department and the individual, and one or two or several main problems should be solved with emphasis. When the main problems are solved, other secondary problems will also be solved accordingly. Third, the following links must be grasped in the inspection work: (1) Questions should be specific; (2) Criticism and self-criticism should be fully developed; (3) Analyze the causes and impact of the problems; (4) Formulate improvement methods and future work plans. Fourth, the scope of inspection and summary work should not be narrowly limited to matters within the organs, but should be linked to the situation at the lower levels; it must start with the implementation of policies, the formulation of plans, the promotion and control of business work, etc., and check and discover problems in the work from the work site and the results of policy implementation. If problems occur at the lower level, then it is necessary to carefully examine whether there are errors in the work guidelines and plans formulated by oneself? Is there insufficient supervision and inspection from above? So as to strengthen the view of being responsible to the higher authorities and at the same time being responsible to the lower authorities. Fifth, relevant documents should also be consulted when inspecting and summarizing work. Study committees at all levels can designate necessary reference documents at any time. Sixth, special attention should be paid to implementing the method of combining the general with the individual, and combining leadership with the masses during the inspection process. Study committees at all levels can select one or two branches or groups to systematically study some experiences to promote the overall situation.

　　河北省级机关开始检查工作
    整风学委会指示检查方法与步骤
    【本报讯】河北省级党群系统各机关已开始检查工作。为此该省整风学委会对于检查的步骤与方法作了专门的指示：一般的从八月六日开始检查工作，到二十七日结束；前两周进行全面的检查与总结工作，后一周解决重点人、事问题。检查方法是从检查与总结工作入手，通过检查与总结工作，联系解决个人的思想、观点、立场、方法问题，以达到改进工作的目的。任何脱离实际工作，孤立的、空洞的检查思想的方法都是得不到好效果的。因此必须：一、检查开始时，一个机关，一个部，处，科的负责人，对本单位的情况，要先作一检讨总结报告，然后展开充分的讨论。并联系每个人的工作检讨。二，检查与总结工作时，应防止面面周到的形式主义的作法；应根据本部门与本人的具体情况，抓住中心环节，有重点的解决一两个或几个主要问题。主要问题解决了，其他次要的问题也随之而解决。三、在检查工作中必须掌握以下几个环节：（一）提问题要具体；（二）要充分展开批评与自我批评；（三）分析问题产生的原因与影响；（四）订出改进的办法与今后工作的计划。四、关于检查与总结工作范围，不能狭隘的局限于机关以内的事情，要与下级的情况联系起来；必须从执行政策，制订计划，推动和掌握业务工作等着手，从工作现场与执行政策的结果中去查看与发现工作中的问题。下面发生了问题则必须好好的审查自己制定的工作方针、计划是否有错误？对下督促检查上有无不够之处？以加强对上负责同时必须对下负责的观点。五、检查与总结工作时，还应当参阅有关文件。各级学委会可随时指定必要的参考文件。六、检查过程中要特别注意贯彻一般与个别相结合，领导与群众相结合的方法。各级学委会可选择一两个支会或小组，系统研究些经验，以推动全面。
