Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 6th: The Miao people in the Xuyong and Gusong areas of southern Sichuan responded to the people's government's call to defend their homes and protect themselves from bandits, and cooperated with the People's Liberation Army to suppress bandits. In April, when the bandit situation in the area was more serious, the Miao people universally organized home-guard teams, posting sentries and standing guard every day to prevent bandit harassment, and cooperated with the troops in three attacks. Luo Jiucai, a Miao resident of Jiancao Township, Xuyong, united dozens of Miao people to organize a home self-defense team, which repeatedly defeated and annihilated small groups of bandits who came to harass them. The Miao people actively led the bandit suppression troops, scouted out the bandit situation, and enthusiastically sent tea and boiled water to the soldiers. The Miao people in various places actively handed over grain to support the bandit suppression troops. The Miao people in Yihe Township, Gusong, completed 95 percent of their grain delivery task within one month. The bandit suppression troops also took time to help the Miao people with their labor, enhancing the friendly unity between the military and civilians and between nationalities.
