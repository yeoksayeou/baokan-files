The Road to Forward Development of the Replication Printing and Dyeing Industry
　　Yu Liting

　　"Hoping that the government will coordinate the overall situation and implement planned production" is the common demand of entrepreneurs in the replication printing and dyeing sector today. This demand indicates that there is currently a phenomenon of blind production in the replication printing and dyeing industry, and in fact, this is indeed the case.

　　Our China has a modern cotton textile replication industry and a printing and dyeing industry with only about thirty years of history. Over the past thirty years, the development of the replication and printing and dyeing industries has been extremely unbalanced. First of all, the distribution of factories is concentrated in coastal ports:

　　Industry　Factories　Location
　　　　　　　　Shanghai　Tianjin　Qingdao　Guangzhou　Other Regions　National Total
　　Printing & Dyeing Industry　24.7　18.8　9.2　——　47.3　100.0
　　Knitting Industry　38.5　——　——　54.6　6.9　100.0

　　In terms of modern equipment, it is even more obviously concentrated in the factories in the above-mentioned ports: for example

　　A. Printing and Dyeing Equipment:
　　Equipment　Region
　　　　　　　　Shanghai　Tianjin　Qingdao　Other Regions　National Total
　　Mercerizing Machines　64.1　19.0　5.0　2.9　100.0
　　Naphthol Dyeing Machines　77.4　3.0　13.0　6.6　100.0
　　Printing Machines　77.8　5.0　10.0　7.2　100.0
　　Boiling Kettles　80.0　2.7　4.5　12.8　100.0
　　Dyeing Vats　34.3　19.7　5.5　40.5　100.0

　　B. Electric Knitting Equipment:
　　Equipment　Region
　　　　　　　　Shanghai　Guangzhou　Tianjin　Other Regions　National Total
　　Tompson Machines　62.5　26.8　7.6　3.1　100.0
　　Wildman Machines　67.0　——　28.2　4.8　100.0
　　Double-sided Machines　72.0　18.2　7.0　2.8　100.0

　　In terms of production capacity, it is out of sync with the supply of raw materials and market needs. The National Replication Printing and Dyeing Conference estimated that if the printing and dyeing industry is equipped with auxiliary machinery and equipment, the nation's maximum annual production capacity can reach 240 percent of the nation's current annual output of cloth (including hand-woven cloth). In other words, the dyeing and printing capacity exceeds the supply of grey cloth by 2.4 times. If hand-woven cloth is excluded and the remaining 60 percent requires machine bleaching and dyeing, the cloth that needs to be bleached and dyed only reaches slightly more than one-fifth of the nation's maximum bleaching and dyeing capacity. This means that our printing and dyeing industry, in terms of its main equipment, has already greatly exceeded the needs. The situation in the replication industry is roughly similar. For example, handkerchiefs, knitwear, towels, blankets, etc., have also reached a state of oversupply and saturation.

　　What caused this situation? From the two aspects of factory distribution and machinery and equipment, it can be seen that it was not caused after liberation, but was caused since China had modern printing and dyeing and replication industries. From this, we can also see the great harm of a semi-colonial economy to the country.

　　On the other hand, because the production equipment required by the replication and printing and dyeing industries can be relatively simple and easy to develop, during the false prosperity of hyperinflation in the past decade or so, they generally developed blindly from a handicraft-style production and decentralized operation basis. As a result, most replication and printing and dyeing factories have innate shortcomings: incomplete equipment, machinery not in complete sets, and operating methods still in a semi-mechanical and semi-manual state. They manufacture sporadically, operate in a decentralized manner, and because they are seasonal, they have never been fully operational. It is precisely because of this situation that they are weak, have an unsound foundation, engage in blind production and disconnect from production and sales. Therefore, in terms of both production and operation, they cannot but create some special difficulties and shortcomings. These difficulties and shortcomings become even more prominent as prices tend to stabilize, false purchasing power disappears, and real purchasing power has yet to be gradually improved. In addition, the knitting industry, for example, has a large proportion of finished products that rely on foreign sales. Their fate, it can be said, is not mainly in their own hands, but is controlled by foreign merchants. Once foreign sales are obstructed and stagnate, difficulties become unavoidable. These facts illustrate how industries that have long been parasitic on and serving imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism are out of touch with the needs of the Chinese people. The reason why our entrepreneurs propose the hope of implementing planned production is precisely the lesson learned from painful experience.

　　To implement planned production, we must overcome the current blind phenomena. This requires formulating a production plan that meets the actual situation in coordination with market needs. The fact before us is that the dyeing and printing and replication equipment we are currently operating has reached a saturation point in supplying market needs. Then, our production policy can only and should only be based on maintaining the status quo for the time being. If we want to increase production today, it is equivalent to blind recovery and blind development. Some regions demand that factories that have stopped work be generally restored immediately, believing that as long as "they voluntarily resume work and undertake processing work, their actual situation can be considered and helped." Some regions are planning to set up new printing and dyeing and replication factories, or purchase new machines from abroad. These are all blind. Blind recovery and blind development are by no means developing production, but creating difficulties. This is one aspect. On the other hand, we should also prevent sudden processing, without foreseeing seasonal needs, rushing to the last minute, forming abnormal phenomena such as sometimes working overtime to rush production and sometimes stopping work to lay off employees, or not calculating the required amount of raw materials, not planning in advance, and temporarily rushing to purchase and order when needed, causing market chaos. This is also blind. We must overcome these phenomena to gradually put the replication printing and dyeing industry on the road to planned production. The production plan formulated by the National Replication Printing and Dyeing Conference after calculating production and sales should be resolutely implemented in various regions to avoid the recurrence of the blind phenomenon of opening and closing factories at the same time.

　　Of course, formulating a production plan does not mean that the difficulties are solved. To solve the difficulties in the enterprise, we must also improve our business management. In this regard: the government can naturally coordinate the overall situation and assist entrepreneurs in overcoming difficulties as much as possible under the principle of giving consideration to both public and private interests. The government's recent convening of various professional meetings to adjust industry and commerce is a concrete measure to assist entrepreneurs in overcoming difficulties. However, among our entrepreneurs, there are also those who regard the meetings for adjusting industry and commerce as purely government meetings to give processing orders. This is inappropriate. In order to maintain production and assist private manufacturers in solving difficulties, state-owned enterprises can process and order a portion under necessary conditions. However, after processing orders, state-owned enterprises must also be able to sell them, otherwise, they will not be able to continue processing orders. Therefore, to expand processing orders, it is necessary to expand the scope of sales, which will affect private commerce. In order to take care of private commerce, Director Chen Yun said in his report at the Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC that "the number of retail stores and department stores set up by state-owned trading organizations should be limited to stabilizing retail market prices, preventing speculation, and preventing merchants from disrupting the market." Therefore, the number of processing orders cannot be arbitrarily increased regardless of the actual situation. The country's financial situation has just begun to improve, and revenue and expenditure are just approaching balance. A large number of processing orders in all walks of life will affect the balance of financial revenue and expenditure and the stability of prices.

　　Therefore, to overcome the difficulties in our enterprises, we cannot just ask for government assistance. The main responsibility should be borne by the entrepreneurs themselves to strive to improve operation and management.

　　This requires:

　　First, organize joint operations. Since most of the replication printing and dyeing industries are small factories and workshops with semi-handicraft production methods, incomplete equipment, and poor technology, it is even more necessary to organize joint operations. Joint operation is a way to change decentralized operation into joint operation. The strength of decentralized operation is small. Once united, it can increase strength. Northeast China and Shanghai have already started doing this and have achieved certain results. The Qingdao printing and dyeing industry has also decided to start with jointly purchasing dyes and gradually move towards joint operation and joint sales.

　　The main purpose of joint operation is to concentrate efforts, solve difficulties, and gradually lead China's replication printing and dyeing industry from handicraft production methods to modern industrial roads. It is neither a monopolistic organization seeking exorbitant profits nor an organization that creates dependence, but an organization that improves operations. Therefore, on the one hand, we should prevent the use of joint operation institutions to monopolize the market, raise prices, and exploit small businesses. Various regions may organize one or several joint operation institutions according to the actual situation. On the other hand, we must also prevent speculators who straddle both sides, who still operate the good machines they have started independently, while joining the unstarted bad machines in joint operations, requesting loans, and resuming production, shifting the responsibility to the government. We should oppose these two situations, because that is not for improving operations and overcoming difficulties, but for speculative profit and shifting blame. We should also support joint operation institutions that are truly based on the principle of voluntariness, provide them with all conveniences and assistance, and enable them to gradually embark on normal operations.

　　Second, we must be meticulous and operate according to business standards. In the large and small manufacturers of the national replication printing and dyeing industry, there are more or less unreasonable phenomena, such as bloated organizations, overstaffing, high expenses, and high costs. In a dyeing factory in Tianjin, among all 160 employees, only 90 were workers, and 70 were staff members! In private knitting factories in Shanghai, there is such a phenomenon: a factory has a total of 48 main machines, employs 44 workers, and has as many as 21 staff members! Including one manager, one deputy manager, one factory director, and one accountant each, one cashier, plus one treasurer, and one salesman, and two cooks! Technicians and assistant technicians account for four people. In addition to the warehouse clerk, there are assistant warehouse clerks, clerks, and dispatchers. The number of titles is staggering. Such operation and management can only be developed under the conditions of hyperinflation and speculation, which is extremely abnormal. Now that prices are stable, it is necessary to be meticulous and operate reasonably. The National Replication Printing and Dyeing Conference has formulated a preliminary draft of operating standards for the printing and dyeing industry and the knitting industry. This draft meticulously stipulates the "four fixings" - fixed materials, fixed personnel, fixed quality, and fixed quantity - based on medium-sized printing and dyeing factories and knitting factories as standards, laying a preliminary foundation for meticulous calculation, improving management, correcting crude manufacturing, and accurately grasping cost accounting, pointing out the direction of operation and management. From now on, it is possible to act in accordance with the regulations, and the existing work will be improved. We should strive to reach the limits stipulated by the operating standards.

　　Third, factory management committees should be established in state-owned factories, and labor-management consultation meetings should be established in private factories. Since the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings in a few private dyeing and weaving industries, their achievements have been shown. The example of labor-management consultation in Shanghai Huafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory to produce at cost, and the example of streamlining and saving in Shanghai Xinguang Underwear Factory are both vivid and effective typical examples. These examples show that as long as we can proceed from improving production based on the principle of mutual benefit for labor and management, respect each other, take care of each other, and seek labor-management unity, it is possible to overcome difficulties and strive for improvement. Although labor-management consultation meetings have been established in some replication printing and dyeing industries in various regions, most factories have not yet established them. All those that have not established labor-management consultation meetings should be established in a timely manner to solve the existing labor-management problems and establish new labor-management relations.

　　Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen and improve trade associations. It can be seen in the National Replication Printing and Dyeing Conference that the relationship between the same industry and the trade association is not close enough in most regions. This makes it impossible to exchange experiences between factories in the same region, making it difficult to improve work, and also increasing the difficulty for the government to understand the actual situation of private factories. It is difficult to help even if you want to. For the replication printing and dyeing industry with a large number of units and scattered operations, it is particularly necessary to strengthen and improve trade associations. Trade associations should play an organizational and guiding role for manufacturers, help and urge the industry to improve production, improve management, abide by and implement common resolutions, and promote work. For the government, it is to reflect the situation and put forward opinions, so that the administration and manufacturers can communicate with each other and facilitate problem-solving. This is also an important link in improving operation and management.

　　As long as we can overcome blind production and improve operation and management, the current difficulties existing in the replication and printing and dyeing industry are not difficult to overcome gradually. Replication and printing and dyeing are both industries that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. With the gradual improvement of the country's financial situation, it will undoubtedly be gradually improved. The prospect of its development is certain.

　　复制印染工业向前发展的道路
　　俞鲤庭
    “希望政府统筹全局，实行计划生产”，这是今天复制印染部门企业家们的共同要求。这一要求说明了目前在复制印染业中，存在着盲目生产的现象，而事实上也确是如此。
    我们中国有近代化的棉纺复制工业与印染工业，不过三十年左右历史。三十年来，复制业与印染业的发展是极不平衡的，首先是工厂的分布，集中在沿海口岸：业别  厂家  地点      上海      天津      青岛      广州      其他地区    全国总计印染工业              二四·七  一八·八  九·二    ——      四七·三    一○○·○针织工业              三八·五  ——      ——      五四·六  六·九      一○○·○
　　论近代化设备，则更明显地集中于上述口岸的工厂中：例如
    甲、印染设备：设备地区      上海      天津      青岛      其他地区      全国总计精元机        六四·一  一九·○  五·○    二·九        一○○·○纳夫妥机      七七·四  三·○    一三·○  六·六        一○○·○印花机        七七·八  五·○    一○·○  七·二        一○○·○浸练釜        八○·○  二·七    四·五    一二·八      一○○·○染槽          三四·三  一九·七  五·五    四○·五      一○○·○
    乙、电力针织设备：设备地区      上海      广州      天津      其他地区       全国总计汤姆生机      六二·五  二六·八  七·六    三·一         一○○·○台麦鲁机      六七·○  ——      二八·二  四·八         一○○·○双面机       七二·○   一八·二  七·○    二·八         一○○·○
    论生产能力，则与原料供应及市场需要脱节的。全国复制印染会议估计印染业如配齐辅助机器设备，全国全年的最高生产能力，可以达到目前全国全年所产布匹（连手工织布在内）的百分之二百四十。换句话说，印染的能力超过坯布的供应量二·四倍。如果除开手工织布，其余按其中百分之六十需要机器漂染计算，全国须漂染的布匹，仅达全国最高漂染能力五分之一强。这就是说，我们的印染业，就其主要设备而言，已经是大大超过了需要了。复制业的情况也大致相似，例如手帕、针织品、毛巾、被毯等，也已达到过剩与饱和的状态。
    是什么原因造成了这种状态？这从工厂分布与机器设备两项可以看出，绝非解放以后所造成，而是中国有近代印染业与复制业以来就造成了的。从这里也可看出半殖民地经济对于国家危害性之大。
    另一方面，由于复制业与印染业所需要的生产设备可以比较简单，容易发展，在过去十几年通货膨胀假性繁荣期间，一般地就从手工式的生产和分散经营的基础上盲目发展起来。结果大部分复制业与印染业厂家具有先天的缺点设备不齐全机械不成套操作方法，至今仍然处于半机械半手工的状态中，零星制造，分散经营，而且因其有季节性，也从未全部开工。正是由于这种情况，形成力量单薄，基础不实，盲目生产与产销脱节，所以无论在生产方面，经营方面，都不能不造成一些特殊困难和缺点。这种困难和缺点，在物价趋于稳定，虚假购买力消失，真实购买力尚待逐步提高的情况下，就益发突出。此外，如针织工业，有很大一部分成品要依赖外销，它们的命运，可以说，主要不是掌握在自己的手上，而是操在外国商人的手上，一旦外销受阻停滞，困难也就无可避免。这些事实说明了长期寄生在和服务于帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义的工业，是怎样与中国人民的需要相脱节。我们企业家之所以提出希望，实行计划生产，正是从痛苦的经验中得出来的教训。
    要实行计划生产，就必须克服目前存在着的盲目现象。这就要配合市场的需要，订出符合实际情况的生产计划。摆在眼前的事实，是我们现在开动着的印染和复制设备，在供应市场的需要上已经达到了饱和点。那么，我们的生产方针，暂时还只能够也只应该以维持现状为主。今天如果要增加生产，即等于盲目的恢复和盲目的发展。某些地区要求将停工的工厂一般地立时恢复起来，认为只要“现在自愿复工承接加工工作，可以考虑其实际情况予以帮助”，某些地区正拟新设印染和复制工厂，或是从国外购入新的机器，这些都是盲目的。盲目恢复与盲目发展绝不是发展生产，而是制造困难。这是一方面。另一方面，也应当防止突击式的加工，没有预见季节性的需要，急来抱佛脚，形成有时加班赶做，有时停工解雇等等不正常现象，或是不计算原物料的需要量，事前没有计划，临时需要就临时抢购抢订，造成市场紊乱，这同样是盲目的。必须克服这些现象，才能使复制印染工业逐步走上计划生产的道路。全国复制印染会议计算了产销情况之后所订出的生产计划，各地区应当坚决付之实施，以避免一面开工一面关厂的盲目现象之再产生。
    当然，制订了生产计划，还不等于困难的解决。解决企业中的困难，还必须改善我们的经营管理。在这一方面：政府自然可以统筹全局在公私兼顾的原则下尽可能协助企业家克服困难，最近政府召开各种专业会议，调整工商业，正是协助企业家克服困难的具体措施。但在我们的企业家中间，却也有将调整工商业的会议看成单纯的政府给以加工定货的会议，这是不恰当的。政府为了维持生产和协助私营厂商解决困难，在必需的条件下，国营企业可加工定货一部分。但是加工定货之后，国营企业也必须能销售出去，不然就无法继续进行加工定货。因此要扩大加工定货，势必要扩大销售范围，这就要影响到私营商业。为了照顾私营商业，陈云主任在政协全国委员会第二次会议的报告中曾说，“国营贸易机关所设的零售店和百货公司，其数量以能够稳定零售市场价格，制止投机和商人挠乱市场为限度”，所以加工定货的数字不能不顾实际，任意增加，目前国家财经状况才开始好转，收支才接近平衡，各行各业大量的加工定货，就会影响到财政收支的平衡与物价的稳定。
    因此克服我们企业中的困难，不能只是要求政府的帮助，主要的应该由企业家本身负责努力改善经营和管理。
    这就需要：
    第一，组织联营。由于复制印染工业大多是小型工厂，以及半手工业生产方式的作坊，设备不全，技术较差，更有必要来组织联营。联营是使分散经营改变为联合经营的方式。分散经营的力量小，一旦联合起来就能增加力量。东北上海已开始这样做，并已收到了一定效果。青岛印染业也已决定先从联购染料着手，逐步走向联合经营，联合推销。
    联营的主要目的，是集中力量，解决困难，使中国的复制印染业，从手工业生产方式逐步走向近代化工业的道路，它既不是垄断居奇的机构，也不是造成依赖的机构，而是改善经营的机构。因此一方面应当防止将联营的机构用以垄断市场，抬价居奇，以大吃小。各地无妨按照实际情况，组织一个或几个联营机构，另一方面也要防止脚踏两头船的投机者，他们将开动的好机器仍归自己单独经营，而将未开的坏机器，参加联营，请求贷款，恢复生产，将责任加到政府身上。我们应当反对这两种情况，因为那不是为了改善经营，克服困难，而是为了投机取利，嫁祸于人。我们也应当支持真正以自愿为原则的联营机构，给以一切的便利和帮助，使它们能逐步走上正常经营。
    第二，要精打细算，按照经营标准办事。全国复制印染业的大小厂家中，都或多或少存在着不合理现象，机构臃肿，冗员充斥，开支浩繁，成本高昂。天津一家染厂中，全部职工一百六十人中，工人仅九十人，职员占七十人！上海私营针织厂中，有这样的现象，某厂全部主要的机器共四十八台，雇佣工人四十四人，而职员竟达二十一人！其中包括经理、副经理、厂长、会计各一人，出纳一人之外，又加司库一人，还有营业员一人，厨师二人！技师及助理技师占四人。栈务员之外，又有助理栈务员，事务员，收发员，名目之多，令人咋舌。如此经营管理，当然只能是在通货膨胀投机风行的状态之下发展起来的，是极不正常的。现在物价稳定，就需要精打细算，合理经营。全国复制印染会议已拟订了印染工业与针织工业的初步经营标准草案。这一份草案缜密地规定了以中等印染工厂与针织工厂为标准的“四定”——定料、定员、定质、定量——为今后精打细算，改善管理，改正粗制滥造，正确掌握成本计算，打下了初步基础，指出了经营管理的方向，从此已有照章办事的可能，将现有的工作提高一步。我们应为达到经营标准所规定的限度而努力。
    第三，在公营工厂中应成立工厂管委会，在私营工厂中应成立劳资协商会议。劳资协商会议在少数私营染织业中成立以来，已显出它的成绩。上海华丰染织厂劳资协商保本生产的例子，上海新光内衣厂精简节约的例子，都是生动而有效的典型。这些例子说明了只要能根据劳资两利的原则，从改进生产出发，互相尊重，互相照顾，求得劳资团结，就可能克服困难，争取好转。各地复制印染业一部分虽已成立劳资协商会议，但多数工厂仍未设立，凡未建立劳资协商会议的，都应及时建立，以解决目前还存在的劳资问题，建立新的劳资关系。
    第四，需要加强和健全同业公会。在全国复制印染会议中可以看出来，同业与同业公会的关系，在多数地区中是不够密切的。这就使同一地区内，厂与厂之间的经验无从交流，难以改进工作，并使下情不能上达，同时也增加了政府对于私营工厂实际情况了解的困难，要想帮助也感无从下手。对于单位众多经营分散的复制印染业，加强与健全同业公会，尤有必要。同业公会应对厂家起组织和辅导的作用，帮助和督促同业改进生产，改善管理，尊守和执行共同的决议，推动工作，对政府是反映情况，提出意见，使行政与厂家能上下通气，便于解决问题。这也是改善经营管理的重要环节。
    只要能够克服盲目生产，改善经营管理，复制和印染业目前存在着的困难，是不难逐步克服的。复制和印染业都是有利于国计民生的工业之一，随着国家财经状况的逐步好转，它无疑义地也将获得逐步的好转。它的发展的前途是肯定的。
