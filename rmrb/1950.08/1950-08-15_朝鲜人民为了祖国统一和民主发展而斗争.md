The Korean people, who have achieved glorious victories in the just war to eliminate American imperialism—the thieving, armed aggressor against our country—today welcome the fifth anniversary of national liberation, August 15th.

Five years ago today, the heroic Soviet army led by the Party of Lenin and Stalin completely liberated the Korean people from the shackles of prolonged Japanese imperialist colonial rule.

The Korean people extend the greatest honor and gratitude to the heroic Soviet army and its great leader, Marshal Stalin. He not only liberated the Korean people from the shackles of Japanese imperialist rule, but also provided brotherly assistance in the epoch-making democratic construction of the northern half.

The heroic Soviet army recognized the People's Committees, established based on the spontaneous creativity of the Korean people after liberation, as the true organs of people's power. This enabled the Korean people to become the true masters of the country in political, economic, and cultural life.

All the Korean people in the northern half of the Republic, who became the true masters of the country, implemented democratic elections on a democratic basis in 1946, creating local People's Committees, consolidating and strengthening the People's Committees as the legitimate form of state power.

The People's Committees led the entire people in implementing the Land Reform Ordinance to liquidate feudal land ownership, the Ordinance on Nationalization of Industries, the Labor Ordinance, and the Ordinance on Equal Rights for Men and Women in 1946, thereby creating the conditions for building a democratic and independent country and opening the road to people's democratic development.

In order to restore and develop the people's economy, which was destroyed by the Japanese imperialists, in a short period of time, and to raise the people's material and cultural living standards, the people of the northern half of the Republic entered the path of economic construction on the basis of the victorious implementation of various democratic reforms.

Although facing difficulties and obstacles due to the destruction of most industries, the lack of technical personnel, and the backwardness of technical equipment, the Korean people, with the help of the great Soviet government, displayed highly creative efforts, successfully completed the national plans for 1947 and 1948, and then entered the two-year national plan for 1949-50, completing the planned figures for 1949 and launching a production increase competition movement to complete the 1950 plan ahead of schedule. Some enterprises and factories have already overfulfilled the two-year economic plan.

In the industrial production dominated by the people's economy, if 1946 is taken as 100, it grew by 371.1 percent in 1949. The industrial sector producing machinery exceeded the highest production level of the Japanese imperialists in 1944 by 146.9 percent; the light industry sector increased by 52.7 percent; and in agriculture, grain production exceeded the highest production volume of the Japanese imperialist era in 1939, transforming the northern half of the Republic from a food-deficient area to a food-rich zone.

With the rapid development of the people's economy, the people's material and cultural living standards have been rapidly improved.

In 1949, the number of people's schools (primary schools) in the northern half of the Republic increased 1.8 times compared to 1944 before liberation, while junior and senior high schools increased 20 times, and the number of students increased 23 times. There was not even a single university during the Japanese imperialist rule, but now there are 15 universities, and this year 1,400 graduates have joined the work of the country. Illiteracy among the masses has been basically eliminated. There are 3,700 adult schools and adult middle schools set up for the re-education of adults, with more than 140,000 people participating in learning here.

Thus, in the past five years, the northern half of the Republic has been transformed into a strong democratic base capable of ensuring a unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and strong fatherland in military, political, and economic terms.

However, the southern half of our country, which was liberated by the heroic Soviet army, experienced a completely different phenomenon from the north after the American imperialist bandits landed nearly a month after the Japanese imperialists were defeated and implemented a policy of enslavement in the southern half of our country.

The American imperialist bandits sabotaged the decisions of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference on Korea and deliberately destroyed the cause of the Soviet-American Joint Commission. The American imperialists are frantically trying to turn the southern half of our country into a military base for aggression against the Far East and into a source of raw materials and a sales market for the surplus goods of Wall Street monopolists.

Therefore, American imperialism rejected the legitimate proposal put forward by the Soviet Union in 1948, namely: that the Soviet and American troops withdraw from Korea simultaneously, allowing the Korean people to manage their own affairs. They put on the disguise of the United Nations, passed illegal resolutions on the Korean issue, established the United Nations Commission on Korea, and instigated it to implement the traitorous separate election in South Korea on May 10, 1948. This separate election was fiercely opposed by all the Korean people and 56 patriotic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea. The enemies used brutal massacres and false fabrications of despicable means to conduct the election, and as a result, not a single worker or peasant representative participated. A puppet congress and the Syngman Rhee puppet government were composed of pro-Japanese elements, national traitors, and American lackeys. This was an attempt to fix the artificial division that had already been divided in our country and to bind the Korean people forever under the iron chains of slaves. Therefore, more than 70 patriotic political parties, social organizations, and all the Korean people in North and South Korea held joint conferences in April and June 1948 in order to break the serious situation in the country, decided to implement general elections in North and South Korea, announced the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and established a central government. On August 25, 1948, regardless of the terror and massacres of the American imperialist bandits and the Syngman Rhee bandits, the election of members of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea was implemented in North and South Korea. As a result, 77.52 percent of the eligible voters in the southern half participated in this election, and in the free electoral environment, 99.98 percent of the eligible voters in the northern half of the Republic participated.

The first meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, the highest legislative body of Korea, established with the support of the people of North and South Korea, announced the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in our country, adopted the Constitution of the Republic, consolidated the achievements of the democratic reforms achieved in the northern half of our country, and gave the working people broad political rights, making the reunification and democratic development of the country have broad prospects. The Republic's government approved by the first Supreme People's Assembly is a coalition government composed of basic political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea, and is the only legitimate government supported by all the people.

The great Soviet government, in accordance with the requirements of the first meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea, withdrew its troops from the Korean territory, recognized the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and established diplomatic relations with the Republic's government. This is another new manifestation of Stalin's foreign policy of respecting the autonomy and independence of small and weak nations.

After the establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was announced in our country, the new task before the Korean patriotic political parties and the Korean people was to build a unified, completely autonomous, and independent country. The entire Korean people in the northern half of the country more closely united around the government of the Republic and General Kim Il-sung to launch a solemn construction struggle to promote the reunification of the motherland.

The entire patriotic people in the southern half of the Republic, holding high the banner of the Republic, opposed the American imperialist policy of aggression against our country and launched a struggle to save the country by smashing the Syngman Rhee traitorous bandits.

American imperialism, wearing the mask of the United Nations, created the anti-popular Syngman Rhee puppet government in the southern half of our country, betraying the interests of the Korean people, and signed the ROK-US Military Assistance Agreement and the ROK-US Economic Assistance Agreement with this puppet government, turning the southern half of Korea into a colonial dependency of their colony.

The result of the past five years of American imperialism and Syngman Rhee's traitorous bandits ruling the southern half of our country has been the establishment of a police system of terror, suppression, and massacre. The thieves have fallen into complete isolation and are hated and opposed by the Korean people. However, in order to maintain their reactionary rule, they suppressed and massacred anyone who expressed the slightest dissatisfaction with their reactionary system. Many patriotic people were killed in the southern half of the Republic, and even members of their so-called sacred and inviolable puppet "National Assembly," including 12 people from the right-wing camp, were suppressed and massacred.

Under such enemy suppression and massacres, the people of the southern half responded to reactionary violence with just violence and launched a broader and more comprehensive guerrilla movement.

In such an urgent situation, all the Korean people concentrated all patriotic and democratic forces, united 71 political parties and social organizations in North and South Korea, and organized the "Democratic Front for National Reunification." The Democratic Front for National Reunification discussed the current political situation in the country. In order to oppose the Syngman Rhee gang's attempt to provoke a bloody civil war of fratricide with American weapons and to save the country and the people, the Democratic Front for National Reunification proposed a plan for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Although the plan for peaceful reunification has been enthusiastically supported by all the Korean people, the Syngman Rhee gang not only rejected it, but also carried out massacres of the patriotic Korean people who longed for peaceful reunification.

On June 7, 1950, the Democratic Front for National Reunification once again put forward a plan to promote peaceful reunification in line with the will of all the Korean people who longed for unification and independence. The Syngman Rhee gang once again destroyed it as usual.

On June 19, 1950, the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea resolutely expressed its unyielding will for the reunification and democratic development of the country. According to the aspirations of the democratic parties and people's organizations, it proposed a plan to establish a joint Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the South Korean "National Assembly" as the sole all-Korean legislative body to realize the peaceful reunification of the country.

However, the Syngman Rhee gang, which betrayed the country and the people, launched a civil war of fratricide to answer the peaceful reunification of the country that all the Korean people longed for.

As is well known, the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang, which opposed the peaceful reunification of our country, had long prepared for a civil war of fratricide at the instigation of the American imperialist bandits.

These hateful enemies, regardless of the fact that the people in the southern half were in hunger and cold, increased their exorbitant taxes and levies. Most of the so-called budget was spent on the puppet national defense expenses and the preparation for a civil war of fratricide.

The puppet national defense expenses and police expenses dedicated to massacring the people accounted for 54 percent (52.7 billion won) of the total general budget of 97.4 billion won of the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang in 1950. This figure fully proves the above facts.

In order to cover up their preparations for civil war, these hateful enemies continued to launch conflict incidents on the 38th parallel, causing unrest to the country and the people, and attempting to shift the responsibility for launching conflict incidents to the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang continued to clamor for a "Northern Expedition," provoking more than 1,100 times on the 38th parallel, and invading the sea and air more than 113 times.

The Syngman Rhee traitorous gang, in preparation for the "Northern Expedition," dared to collude with the Japanese warlords, the eternal enemies of the Korean people, at the behest of the American imperialists.

On February 16 this year, Syngman Rhee, along with the puppet government's false foreign minister Lim Byung-jik and Chief of Staff Ding Yiquan, visited the reactionary Yoshida government of the Japanese imperialists, purchased weapons, and signed a treaty on military and political affairs.

In order to purchase weapons to prepare for the fratricidal war, Syngman Rhee, under the orders of MacArthur, transported as many as 5 million stones of grain from the autumn grain to Japan in the past year alone.

In order to launch a civil war of fratricide in Korea, the infamous war monger Dulles, sent by the Washington government, went to Tokyo to confer secretly with MacArthur and then transferred to Seoul. On June 19, he said in the puppet "National Assembly" that "the United States is ready to provide South Korea with material and spiritual assistance in the anti-communist struggle." In this way, the traitors were directly encouraged to provoke a civil war.

The civil war launched by the Syngman Rhee traitorous gang, instigated by the American bandits, basically wiped out the puppet army in less than three days. It personally carried out armed intervention in Korea, exposing its ugliness in front of the people of the world.

The heroic Korean People's Army, which rose up to carry out a just war to eliminate the thieves who invaded our country, is now continuing to advance fiercely towards the enemy's last stronghold, Busan-Jinhae.

The American imperialist executioners, who were repeatedly defeated by the fierce attacks of the heroic Korean People's Army, indiscriminately bombed Korean peaceful cities, rural areas, and innocent old and young people in order to retaliate for their serious failures on the front lines. However, this barbaric act, which disregards international regulations and human morality, cannot prove that they are not a paper tiger, except to increase the thieves' heinous crimes.

The bandits shamelessly said: Only by massacring the peaceful residents of Korea and destroying cultural facilities can the prestige of the United Nations be guaranteed.

However, the Korean land belongs to the Korean people. The Korean people have the right to unify their country. Isn't respecting this right and stopping the thieves who invade other countries the pressing task of the current United Nations?

If it is not remembered that the Korean people's desire and strength to unify the country are just and powerful, and that the power of the people who rise up to defend the country is endless! Then, the Wall Street bandits' miscalculation is inevitable.

It is difficult to teach the enemy with words, the hateful enemies! Carry out your bloody aggression! The Korean people must repay the enemy's atrocities with life for life and blood for blood! The outstanding sons and daughters of Korea who strive for the unification, independence, and national honor of our country must wipe out every invading enemy cleanly.

We must annihilate these thieves who destroy world peace, intimidate and threaten mankind, and strive for final victory in order to repay the fraternal support and assistance given to us by the sincere and kind people all over the world.

The Korean people, who rose up to wage a just war to defeat the invaders, are by no means isolated.

The world democratic camp, headed by the great Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China—more than 800 million united people—are giving fraternal support to our just war.

Victory must belong to the Korean people who are fighting a just struggle for the unification, independence, and freedom of the country and to the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and China!!

　　朝鲜人民为了祖国统一和民主发展而斗争
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使  李周渊
    在消灭美国帝国主义——对我们祖国的强盗般的武装侵犯者——的正义战争中获得辉煌胜利的朝鲜人民，今天迎接着民族的节日八一五解放五周年纪念日。
    在五年前的今天，列宁、斯大林党所领导的英雄的苏维埃军队，把朝鲜人民从长久的日帝殖民地统治的羁绊下整个地解放出来。
    朝鲜人民向英勇的苏联军队及其伟大领袖斯大林大元帅致以最大的荣誉与感谢。他不但把朝鲜人民从日帝统治羁绊下解放出来，并且兄弟般地帮助了划时代的北半部民主建设。
    英勇的苏维埃军队认为解放后根据朝鲜人民自发的创意建立起来的人民委员会，是真正的人民政权机关，这使朝鲜人民在政治、经济、文化生活上成为国家的真正主人。
    在共和国北半部成为国家的真正主人的全体朝鲜人民，于一九四六年在民主主义基础上实行了民主选举，产生了地方人民委员会，巩固并加强了人民委员会——作为合法的国家政权形态。
    人民委员会领导着全体人民在一九四六年实施了清算封建土地所有制的土地改革法令、产业国有化法令、劳动法令、男女平等权法令等从而创造了建设民主主义独立国家的条件，开辟了向人民民主主义发展的道路。
    为了要在短时期内恢复与发展被日帝破坏的人民经济，提高人民的物质、文化生活水平，共和国北半部人民，在实行各项民主改革胜利的基础上，进入了经济建设的途径。
    虽然，由于大部分的产业被破坏，技术人材的缺乏，技术设备的落后，面对着困难和阻碍，但在伟大的苏联政府的帮助下，朝鲜人民却发挥了高度创造性的努力，胜利地完成了一九四七年与一九四八年的国家计划，再进入了一九四九——五○年的两年国家计划，完成了一九四九年度的预定数字，展开了提早完成一九五○年度计划的增产竞赛运动。在部分的企业和工厂，已经超额完成了两年经济计划。
    在人民经济占有主导地位的产业生产量，如一九四六年为一○○，在一九四九年成长了百分之三七一·一。生产机器的产业部门，以百分之一四六·九超过了日帝在一九四四年的最高生产水平；在轻工业部门增加了百分之五二·七；在农业方面粮谷生产量超过了日帝时代一九三九年的最高生产量，使共和国北半部从粮食缺乏变成为粮食丰富的地带。
    随着人民经济的飞跃发展，迅速地提高了人民物质文化、生活水平。
    在一九四九年度，共和国北半部人民学校（小学校）的数目比解放前的一九四四年增加了一·八倍，初中和高中增加了二十倍，学生数增加了二十三倍。日帝统治时代连一个大学也没有，而现在已经有了十五个大学，今年已有了一千四百名的毕业生参加国家的工作了。人民大众中的文盲，基本上业已消灭。为了再教育成人而设的成人学校和成人中学，已有三千七百所，在这里参加学习的人数有十四万名之多。
    这样在过去的五年间，共和国北半部已变成为能够保障统一、独立、民主、富强祖国的军事、政治、经济的坚强的民主基地。
    可是由于英勇的苏联军队而获得了解放的我们祖国南半部，在日帝被击溃将近一个月之后，美帝强盗登陆，施行对我们祖国南半部的奴役政策，造成了与北部迥不相同的现象。
    美帝强盗破坏莫斯科三外长会议关于朝鲜的决定，故意摧毁了苏美共同委员会的事业。美国帝国主义者疯狂地要把我们的祖国南半部变为侵略远东的军事基地，变为华尔街独占资本家的原料供应地和和剩余商品的销售市场。
    所以，美帝国主义拒绝了一九四八年苏联提出的正当提议即：苏美两国军队同时撤出朝鲜，让朝鲜人民自己管理自己的事务。他们又戴了联合国的假面具，通过了关于朝鲜问题的非法决定，成立了联合国朝鲜委员会，并嗾使它在一九四八年五月十日实施了亡国的南朝鲜单独选举。这个单独选举遭受了全朝鲜人民和南北朝鲜五十六个爱国政党社会团体激烈的反对。敌人们就用了残暴屠杀和虚伪捏造的卑鄙手段进行选举，结果没有一个工人和农民代表参加。由亲日派、民族叛徒及美国走狗构成了傀儡国会和李承晚傀儡政府。这是企图固定我们祖国已被两断的人工分裂，束缚朝鲜人民永远在亡国奴的铁链下。所以南北朝鲜的七十余个全体爱国政党，社会团体和全体朝鲜人民，为了打开祖国严重局面，于一九四八年四月和六月召开了联席会议，决定实行南北朝鲜总选举，宣布成立朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，建立中央政府。一九四八年八月二十五日，不顾美帝强盗和李承晚匪徒的恐怖屠杀，南北朝鲜全面的朝鲜最高人民会议议员的选举实行了，结果南半部有选举权者中有百分之七七·五二参加了这个选举，在自由的选举环境中，共和国北半部的有选举权者参加了百分之九九·九八。
    在南北朝鲜人民的支持下所树立的朝鲜最高立法机关，最高人民会议第一次会议，在我们祖国宣布了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的成立，通过了共和国宪法，树立了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国中央政府。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国宪法标志着全体朝鲜人民历代的志望，巩固着我们祖国北半部所获得的民主改革的成果，并给劳动人民以广泛的政治权利，使祖国的统一与民主的发展有宽阔的前途。在第一次最高人民会议所批准的共和国政府是由南北朝鲜基本的各政党社会团体所构成的联立政府，是受全体人民支持的唯一合法政府。
    伟大的苏联政府根据朝鲜最高人民会议第一次会议的要求，撤去了在朝鲜国土上的自己的军队，承认了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，与共和国政府建立了外交关系，这是斯大林对外政策尊重弱小民族的自主权和独立的另一新表现。
    在我们祖国宣布了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的成立以后，摆在朝鲜爱国政党和朝鲜人民面前的新任务是建设统一完全自主独立的国家。北半部全朝鲜人民更紧密的团结在共和国政府和金日成将军的周围，为了促进祖国的统一，展开庄严的建设斗争。
    共和国南半部全体爱国人民高举着共和国的旗帜，反对美帝对我们祖国的侵略政策，并为粉碎李承晚卖国匪帮，而展开救国斗争。
    美国帝国主义戴了联合国假面具在我们祖国的南半部造成了背叛朝鲜人民利益的反人民的李承晚傀儡政府，并与这傀儡政府签订了韩美军事援助协定及韩美经济援助协定，变朝鲜的南半部为他们殖民地的隶属国。
    过去五年间，美国帝国主义和李承晚卖国匪帮统治我们祖国南半部的结果，树立了恐怖、镇压、屠杀的警察制度。贼徒们已陷于完全孤立，受到朝鲜人民的憎恶与反对。可是他们为了维持他们的反动统治制度，无论是谁，只要对他们的反动体系稍表不满，就加以镇压和屠杀。在共和国南半部杀害了许多爱国人民，连他们所谓神圣不可侵犯的傀儡“国会”议员十二名为首的右翼阵营人士也被镇压和屠杀了。
    在这样的敌人的镇压与屠杀下，南半部的人民对于反动的暴力回以正义的暴力，展开了更广泛的全面性的游击运动。
    在这样急迫的情况下，全体朝鲜人民集中了一切爱国民主力量，联合南北朝鲜七十一个政党和社会团体，组织了“祖国统一民主主义战线”。祖国统一民主主义战线讨论了目前祖国所形成的政治形势。为了反对李承晚匪帮妄图用美国武器挑拨同族相争的流血内战和拯救祖国与人民，祖国统一民主主义战线提出了祖国和平统一方案。
    和平统一方案尽管已获得了全体朝鲜人民的热烈支持，但李承晚匪帮不但加以拒绝，而且对于渴望着和平统一的爱国的朝鲜人民还加以大量的屠杀。
    一九五○年六月七日，祖国统一民主主义战线再一次提出了促进和平统一的方案，以符全体朝鲜人民所渴望的统一独立的意志。李承晚匪帮又照例加以摧毁了。
    一九五○年六月十九日，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议常任委员会，对于祖国的统一与民主发展坚决表示了不屈不挠的意志。根据各民主政党与人民团体的志望，提出了以联合朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议与南朝鲜“国会”为唯一的全朝鲜立法机关的方案，以实现祖国的和平统一的方策。
    可是，背叛祖国与人民的李承晚匪帮竟发动了同族相争的内战，来答复全体朝鲜人民所渴望的祖国的和平统一。
    如所周知，反对我们祖国和平统一的李承晚卖国匪帮，在强盗美帝的嗾使下，早对同族相争的内战有所准备了。
    这可恨的仇敌们，不顾南半部人民处于饥寒交迫，更加横征暴敛，所谓预算的大部分竟消耗在傀儡国防费，及同族相争的内战准备上了。
    李承晚卖国匪帮一九五○年度的一般预算总额九百七十四亿元中傀儡国防军费及专用以屠杀人民的警察经费竟占去了全数的百分之五四（五百二十七亿元）。这个数字完全证明了上述的事实。
    这些可恶的敌人们为了掩盖他们所进行的内战准备，继续不断地发动了三八线的冲突事件，使祖国与人民陷于不安，妄图将发动冲突事件的责任转嫁于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国当局。
    美国帝国主义者和李承晚卖国匪帮继续叫嚣着“北伐”，在三八线上共挑衅一千数百次，海空军的侵犯则达一百一十三次之多。
    李承晚卖国匪帮又在“北伐”准备中，奉美帝之命，竟敢与朝鲜人民的世仇——日本军阀勾结起来。
    今年二月十六日，李承晚带同傀儡政府伪外务长官林秉植，参谋长丁一权，赴访日帝反动的吉田政府，购买了军火，并签订了关于军事、政治的条约。
    李承晚为了购买准备同族相争的武器，听从麦克阿瑟的命令，仅去年一年由秋粮中输往日本的粮食就达五百万石之多。
    为了要在朝鲜发动同族相争的内战，华盛顿政府所派的臭名远扬的战争贩子杜勒斯曾到东京与麦克阿瑟密议后转到汉城，六月十九日在傀儡“国会上”说“美国在反共斗争中，已有给韩国以物质与精神的援助准备”。这样，直接鼓舞了卖国贼们挑拨内战。
    美国强盗们嗾使李承晚卖国匪帮所发动的内战，不到三天，傀儡军基本上被消灭了。它亲自实行对朝鲜的武装干涉，在全世界人民的面前暴露了它的丑态。
    为了消灭侵略我们祖国的强盗们，愤起而进行正义战争的英勇的朝鲜人民军，现在已猛向敌人的最后据点——釜山镇海继续挺进着。
    由于英勇的朝鲜人民军的猛击而连败的美帝刽子手们，竟针对着朝鲜的和平城市、农村以及无辜的老幼们滥肆轰炸，要来报复他们前线的严重失败，可是这种目无国际法规和人类道德的蛮行，除了增加贼徒们的滔天罪恶外，是不能证明他们不是一只纸老虎的。
    强盗们无耻的说：只有屠杀朝鲜的和平居民，破坏文化设施，才能保障联合国的威信。
    可是朝鲜的国土是朝鲜人民的。朝鲜人民有统一自己的祖国的权利。尊重这种权利，制止侵略他国的强盗，可不是目前联合国的迫切任务么？
    要是没有记住：朝鲜人民要统一祖国的愿望和力量是正义的、强大的，为保卫祖国而奋起的人民的力量是无尽的！那么，华尔街强盗们的错误估计是不可免的。
    用言语教训敌人是困难的，可恨的敌人们！尽管进行你们的血腥侵略吧！朝鲜人民对于敌人们的暴行一定要以命还命，以血还血！争取我们祖国统一独立和民族荣誉的朝鲜优秀儿女们，一定要把侵略的敌人不留一个的消灭干净。
    我们一定要把这破坏世界和平、恐吓和威胁人类的强盗们歼灭掉，争取最后胜利，来报答全世界真诚善良人民们所给我们的兄弟的声援和帮助。
    为了击溃侵略者起而进行正义战争的朝鲜人民，决不是孤立的。
    伟大的苏联与中华人民共和国为首的世界民主阵营——八亿以上团结起来的人民，对我们的正义战争给予着兄弟的声援。
    胜利一定是属于为祖国的统一独立和自由奋起而进行正义斗争的朝鲜人民和苏联与中国为首的世界和平民主阵营的！！
