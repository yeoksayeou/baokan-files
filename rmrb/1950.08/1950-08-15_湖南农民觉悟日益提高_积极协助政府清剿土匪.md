Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 14th.  The peasants of Hunan Province are becoming increasingly aware in the movement against local bullies and rent reduction. They are now assisting the People's Government in suppressing bandits. In Yuanling County, a farmer led troops to hunt down bandit leader Li Ronghou, traversing sixteen large mountains for nine consecutive days, traveling six hundred li, and only returned home after capturing Li. Bandit leader Xia Buyun, the "Deputy Commander of the Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," disguised himself as a boatman and fled to Luhuajiang in Yiyang. The local militia and backbone team detained him for questioning. Bandit Xia even tried to deny his identity, asking the people on the boat to prove he was a boatman. However, the peasants on the boat said, "Stop pretending, who doesn't know you are the big bully Xia Buyun?" Li Xiaqing, the head of the bandit "Military Intelligence Bureau's Directly Subordinate Dongting Advance Team," disguised himself as a grain-buying country merchant and fled near Cili County, but was also recognized by farmer Zhuo Renmou. Bandit Li tried to bribe Zhuo Renmou with gold rings and silver dollars to let him go. But Zhuo Renmou said seriously, "Gold mountains and silver mountains cannot redeem your sins, come with me to the district government." Bandit leader He Jun, who had murdered our district cadres in Taoyuan County last year, was relentlessly pursued by troops for five days and nights, without eating a single grain of rice. He stumbled into the home of farmer Li Zhilin to beg for food. Li Zhilin instructed his wife to cook while he found six farmers to lie in ambush and monitor bandit He. After He finished eating, he asked Li to lead the way. Li led him to the troops suppressing bandits. Many family members of bandits and people related to bandits have also been actively persuading bandits to register with the People's Government for a new start. For stubborn bandits who refuse to repent, they disregard their relationship and personally lead troops to arrest them. Liu Mazi, a habitual bandit who had plagued the people in Mayang County for more than ten years, was secretly reported by his uncle, who also led troops to arrest him. Among the bandits captured by the militia in the Sixth District of Anhua County, thirteen were their relatives. They even pointed at the bandits and said, "When you become bandits, we don't recognize you as relatives." Currently, the peasants of Hunan Province have formed about 400,000 militias and anti-bandit self-defense teams. They use spears and shotguns to guard and patrol the mountain ridges and key road intersections day and night, protecting the fruits of their victory against local bullies and rent reduction.

　　湖南农民觉悟日益提高
    积极协助政府清剿土匪
    【新华社长沙十四日电】湖南省农民在反恶霸和减租运动中觉悟日益提高，他们现在正在协助人民政府清剿土匪。沅陵县一个农民领着部队追捕匪首李荣厚，一连九天翻了十六座大山，走了六百里，直到把李匪捉住了才回家。“反共救国军副司令”匪首夏步云，化装成船夫逃到益阳芦花江。当地民兵基干队扣住他盘查，夏匪还想抵赖，请船上的人证明他是船夫。船上的农民却说：“别装蒜吧，谁不知你是大恶霸夏步云。”匪“军统局直属洞庭挺进队司令”头子黎夏卿，化装成买谷乡客逃到慈利县城附近，也被农民卓仁谋识破了。黎匪用金圈银洋想收买卓仁谋放他。但是卓仁谋严肃地说：“金山银山赎不了你的罪，跟我上区政府去吧。”去年曾经在桃源县杀害我区干部的匪首何钧，被部队穷追五天五夜，粒米未进，一头钻到农民李之林家要饭吃。李之林一面吩咐他老婆煮饭，一面找了六个农民埋伏监视着何匪。何匪吃了饭要李带路。李就把他带给了剿匪的部队。许多土匪的家属和与土匪有关系的人，也纷纷劝导土匪向人民政府登记自新。对不肯自新的顽固匪徒，他们就不顾情面亲自带部队去抓。在麻阳县为害人民十几年的惯匪刘麻子，就是他叔父密告并领了部队去抓住的。安化县六区的民兵抓住的土匪，有十三人是他们的亲戚。他们还指着土匪们说：“当土匪就不认你是亲戚。”现在湖南全省农民已组成四十万左右的民兵和防匪自卫队，他们用梭标、鸟枪日夜在山岗上，要道口警戒盘查，保卫着他们反恶霸和减租的胜利果实。
