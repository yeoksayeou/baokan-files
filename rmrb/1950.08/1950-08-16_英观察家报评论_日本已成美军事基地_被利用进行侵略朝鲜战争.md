　　British Observer Newspaper Commentary
    Japan Has Become a U.S. Military Base
    Being Used to Wage Aggression in the Korean War
    [Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th] TASS, London, 14th: The Tokyo correspondent of the Observer newspaper, in commenting on the five years of the occupation of Japan, wrote: Japan has "developed into a dangerous state of being the main U.S. military base in the Pacific. U.S. military aircraft are taking off from Japanese soil, Japanese ships are loading military supplies to Korea, and Japanese labor is being hired to do military work." The correspondent pointed out: Japan "suddenly finds itself virtually an important pillar of U.S. military power. The tragedy of this situation is that ordinary Japanese people are truly and wholeheartedly dedicated to peace, and they deeply know the madness and evil of war."
    The correspondent wrote, referring to the U.S. establishment of a Japanese army: "The 75,000-strong National Police Reserve Force will be a highly trained and fully armed paramilitary organization whose duty is to maintain domestic order and suppress subversion. Whatever this organization may become in the future, Japan has undoubtedly restored the nature of a police state."

    日本已成美军事基地
    被利用进行侵略朝鲜战争
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦十四日讯：观察家报东京记者在评论占领日本五年时写道：日本已“发展成为美国在太平洋主要军事基地的危险状态了。美国军用飞机正从日本国土上起飞，日本船只正装载军需品到朝鲜，日本劳动力被雇用来从事军事工作”。记者指出：日本“突然发现它自己实际上是美国军事力量的重要支柱。这种局势的悲剧在于：一般普通的日本人真正全心全意地献身和平，他们深知战争的疯狂和罪恶”。
    记者在谈到美国建立日本陆军时写道：“共有七万五千人的国家警察后备队，将是一种受到高度训练和充分武装的准军事组织，其职责在于维持国内秩序和镇压颠覆活动。无论这种组织将来可能变为怎样，日本无疑地又恢复了警察国家的性质。”
