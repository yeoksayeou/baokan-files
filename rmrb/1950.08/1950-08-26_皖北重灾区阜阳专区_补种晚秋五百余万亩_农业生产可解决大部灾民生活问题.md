　　Fuyang Prefecture, a Heavily Afflicted Area in Northern Anhui
　　Replants Over Five Million Mu of Late Autumn Crops
　　Agricultural Production Can Solve the Livelihood Problems of Most Disaster Victims
　　[Report from this newspaper] Fuyang Prefecture, a heavily afflicted area in northern Anhui, is vigorously leading the masses to replant late autumn crops under the guiding principle of production for disaster relief. Currently, the entire prefecture has replanted over 5.7 million mu. Based on the disaster situation, the prefecture has determined that production for disaster relief (combined with social mutual assistance and government relief) will be the overriding central task for the next ten months. It has also decided to resolve 80 percent of the disaster victims' livelihood issues through agricultural production. It requires severely affected areas to replant three-quarters of the flooded land, with each mu yielding 40 jin of autumn harvest. General areas are required to plant all of the flooded area, with each mu yielding 40 to 60 jin of late autumn harvest. To ensure the completion of this agricultural production plan, governments at all levels and cadres at all levels are leading the masses in drainage, damming breaches, reinforcing embankments, and replanting.
　　While the water had not yet receded, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office allocated 3.5 billion RMB and over 5 million jin of seeds to the prefecture. The Special Commissioner's Office also dispatched personnel to Beijing, Shenyang, Pingyuan, and other places on the 18th of this month to purchase large quantities of buckwheat, turnips, potatoes, and other late autumn seeds. As of August 13th, 3.5 million jin of buckwheat seeds had been purchased, and another 3.5 million jin are expected to be shipped back soon. Cooperatives in various counties are also purchasing late autumn seeds through various channels and mobilizing the masses to raise some on their own. For example, the Linquan County government lent 510,000 jin of seeds to the masses, solving 21 percent of the total seed requirement. The cooperative purchased from other places and solved 8.7 percent, and the masses' free trade and loans solved more than 70 percent. The Yingshang Cooperative purchased seeds for the masses, which was greatly supported by the disaster victims. The Zhangji District government in Bo County used surplus food expenses to purchase 2,000 jin of seeds for disaster victims to replant. Wang Chulin, the Communist Party branch secretary of Wafang Township in Fuyang, prepared seeds for the masses, wading through water to lightly affected areas to mobilize door-to-door to borrow surplus sweet potato seedlings. Men Zhanfang, a party member in a certain village, contributed two fen of sweet potato seedlings, which promoted the village to contribute 300 jin of sweet potato seedlings. The personnel of the Yuanzhai Workers' Cooperative in Fuyang braved the rain to buy 2,400 jin of mung beans and 100 jin of radish seeds from Jieshou, selling them to disaster victims at the original price, which was 1,500 RMB cheaper per jin than the market price. This spirit of actively helping disaster victims solve difficulties and mutual assistance further inspired the disaster victims' confidence in overcoming the disaster.
　　After July 24th, the water levels in inland rivers gradually decreased. Cadres in various places organized the masses to systematically dredge ditches and divert water into rivers. The submerged land successively emerged from the water. Under the slogan of "drain a piece, plant a piece," "follow the water, rush to plant," they overcame all difficulties and launched a tense replanting campaign. In the heavily afflicted area of Funan, after the water receded, some areas had not yet received seeds. The masses tried every means to raise seeds and replant. In Cuiji Village, Yuji District, a heavily afflicted area, 780 mu of land was flooded, and 680 mu emerged from the water, and 600 mu were replanted. Most of the seeds were solved by the masses themselves. Other areas such as Fangji and Zhaoji in semi-disaster and lightly affected areas have replanted two-thirds. Currently, the entire county has replanted more than 230,000 mu. The Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Guoyang County and the head of Guoyang County personally led cadres to the countryside to guide the replanting work. The Mengcheng County government also organized more than 300 people to go to the countryside to guide drainage and replanting. Therefore, the masses' enthusiasm for replanting was particularly high. For example, in some areas of Taihe County, the water had not completely receded, and the masses were inserting sweet potato seedlings in the mud. In general villages in Mengcheng, Fuyang, and other places, farmers plowed sweet potato ridges during the day, and men went to distant places to plant sweet potatoes at night, while women planted sweet potatoes near the village, and livestock were concentrated for care. Under such a tense replanting effort, Fuyang County had 1.58 million mu of completely flooded land, and 790,000 mu have been replanted. Linquan replanted more than 690,000 mu, accounting for 83 percent of the total flooded land. Fengtai and Yingshang, which suffered the most from the disaster with a wide area and deep disaster, also seized the time to replant. Fengtai planted more than 220,000 mu, and Yingshang planted 600,000 mu. Other areas such as Mengcheng, Taihe, Guoyang, and Bo County have all replanted 60 to 80 percent of the total flooded land. As of now (August 10th), according to incomplete statistics, the entire prefecture has replanted 5,718,677 mu, accounting for more than one-third of the 15,310,000 mu of completely and partially flooded land in the entire prefecture.
　　According to the research results of the masses in Mengcheng and Guoyang, replanting one mu of sweet potatoes and three fen of turnips per person, plus other vegetables and sideline production, can survive the famine. In this area, one mu of sweet potatoes can yield 1,000 jin, and three fen of turnips, plus intensive cultivation, can yield 1,500 jin. The minimum daily living for each person is four jin, and ten months can only eat 1,200 jin. Therefore, as long as agricultural production is done well, the masses have a way to survive the famine. The entire Mengcheng County has replanted eight fen of sweet potatoes and three fen of turnips per person. Most of Guoyang meet the standard of one mu of sweet potatoes and three fen of turnips per person. Longshan District in Guoyang has planted one and a half mu of sweet potatoes and five fen of turnips per person. If other crops or early-maturing crops continue to be replanted and various sideline businesses are developed, there is a way to survive the famine.

　　皖北重灾区阜阳专区
    补种晚秋五百余万亩
    农业生产可解决大部灾民生活问题
    【本报讯】皖北重灾区阜阳专区，正在生产救灾的方针下，大力领导群众补种晚秋，现全专区已补种五百七十余万亩。该专区根据灾情，确定以生产救灾（并结合社会互济、政府救济）为今后十个月压倒一切的中心工作，并决定以农业生产解决灾民百分之八十的生活，并要求重灾区补种淹地到四分之三，每亩收秋收四十斤；一般地区要求淹地面积全部种上，每亩晚秋收四十到六十斤。为保证完成这一农业生产计划，各级政府与各级干部正领导群众进行排水、堵口、补堤、补种等工作。
    各地在水未退时，皖北行署即拨给该专区人民币三十五亿元、购买种籽五百余万斤，专署亦于本月十八日派专人赴京、沈、平原等各地采购大批的荞麦、芜菁、马铃薯等晚秋种籽，至八月十三日止已购回荞麦种三百五十万斤，其他尚有三百五十余万斤不日即可运回。各县合作社也多方采购晚秋种籽，并发动群众自己筹划一部。如临泉县政府贷给群众种籽五十一万斤，解决了全部种籽的百分之二十一，合作社自外地采购解决了百分之八·七，群众贩运自由借贷解决了百分之七十多。颍上合作社为群众购种籽，甚得灾民拥护。亳县张集区政府将伙食节余购种籽二千斤，供灾民补种。阜阳瓦房乡中共支书王初林为群众筹备种籽，涉水到轻灾区挨门挨户动员借出多余的红芋秧，某村党员门占芳献出二分红芋秧，推动全村献出了红芋秧三百斤。阜阳袁砦工人合作社人员，冒雨到界首买回二千四百斤绿豆，一百斤红萝卜种籽，照原价卖给灾民，比市价每斤贱一千五百元。这种积极帮助灾民解决困难和互助友爱精神，更鼓舞了灾民战胜灾荒的信心。
    七月二十四日以后，内地河流水位逐渐下降，各地干部即组织群众有计划地疏沟引水入河，受淹土地先后露出水面，在“干一块，种一块”，“跟水走，赶水种”的口号下，排除一切困难，展开了紧张的抢种补种热潮。阜南重灾区水退后，当时部分地区种籽尚未运到，群众即想尽一切办法自筹补种。重灾区的于集区崔集村，淹地七百八十亩，出水六百八十亩，就补种了六百亩，种籽多为群众自己解决。其他如半灾与轻灾区的方集、赵集等地已补种到三分之二，现全县已补种到二十三万余亩。中共涡阳县委书记及涡阳县长亲自带领干部下乡领导补种工作。蒙城县府也组织了三百余人下乡领导排水抢种。因此群众抢种情绪也特别高涨。如太和县有些地区水还未完全下去，群众即在泥中插红芋秧，蒙城、阜阳等地一般乡村的农民，白天犁好红芋垅，晚上男子去远地栽红芋、妇女在庄边栽红芋，牲口集中看管。在这样的紧张抢种下，阜阳县全淹地一百五十八万亩，已补种到七十九万余亩。临泉补种六十九万余亩，占全淹地的百分之八十三。这次受灾最大，面广灾深的凤台、颍上也抓紧时间抢种，凤台种到二十二万余亩，颍上已种六十万亩，其他如蒙城、太和、涡阳、亳县等都补种到全淹地的百分之六十至八十不等。全专区至目前为止（八月十日）据不完全统计，已补种五百七十一万八千六百七十七亩，占全专区全淹半淹地一千五百三十一万亩的三分之一强。
    据蒙城、涡阳群众研究的结果，每人补种一亩红芋、三分葫萝卜，加上其他菜蔬及副业生产，是可以度过灾荒的。这一带种红芋一亩可收一千斤，三分葫萝卜加上精耕细作，能收一千五百斤。每日每人生活最低以四斤计，十个月只能吃一千二百斤，因此，只要农业生产搞好了，群众度荒是有办法的。蒙城全县每人已补种红芋八分，葫萝卜三分。涡阳大部分都合每人一亩红芋、三分葫萝卜标准。涡阳龙山区每人已种红芋一亩半、葫萝卜五分。如继续补种其他作物或早熟庄稼，开展各项副业，度过灾荒是有办法的。
