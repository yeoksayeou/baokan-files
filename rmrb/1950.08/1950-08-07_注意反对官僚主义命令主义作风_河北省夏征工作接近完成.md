　　Pay Attention to Opposing Bureaucratic Commandist Work Style
    Hebei Province Summer Grain Collection Work Approaching Completion
    Grasping the situation, publicizing policies, and overcoming a purely task-oriented viewpoint are three important links in correctly implementing policies.
    [This Newspaper] The summer grain collection work in Hebei Province is about to be completed. The province's summer grain collection work is being carried out in the spirit of opposing bureaucracy and opposing coercion and commandism. Starting from June 15th, the province began to deploy the collection work from top to bottom. By July 15th, most areas had assigned tasks to the villages. After July 15th, it entered the intense grain delivery stage. It is estimated that the task of entering the warehouse can be completed by the end of July. The phenomenon of completing tasks using bureaucratic and coercive commandist methods, which existed in the past, has been greatly reduced.
    According to existing materials, grasping the situation of wheat fields and yields, publicizing policies widely and in-depth, and correcting cadres' erroneous thinking of "conflict between tasks and policies" are the three main links in overcoming bureaucracy and coercion and commandism in collection, and correctly implementing policies to complete tasks. Most areas in the province have done this, especially Zhao County in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, which has done the best. Zhao County was one of the most notoriously "terrible, chaotic, and in arrears" counties in previous collections. However, this year, in implementing policies, it overfulfilled the tasks assigned by higher authorities ahead of schedule on July 12th. The reasons for this achievement are as follows: (1) Investigative research was conducted before the wheat harvest to grasp the real situation of wheat fields and yields, and tasks were correctly assigned to each district and village. (2) The summer grain collection policy was publicized widely and in-depth. (3) At the cadre meetings, the facts of sixteen model village branches that completed tasks by following the mass line and implementing policies in the autumn collection were contrasted with the facts of those who could not complete tasks by coercion and commandism, educating cadres and correcting the erroneous idea that "tasks cannot be completed without coercion and commandism." (4) The exemplary actions of Party members, cadres, and representatives taking the lead in handing over grain broke the resistance and wait-and-see psychology of some of the masses. (5) Leading cadres diligently inspected and promptly exposed the collective embezzlement by the cadres of Fujiawan Village and reported the results of the handling to the entire county; on the other hand, they promptly reported and commended the cadres of Yaojiazhuang and other three villages who were active and responsible and correctly implemented policies. (6) Under the unified leadership of the collection committees at all levels, cadres divided their responsibilities, organizing grain delivery on one hand and leading production – watering cotton and hoeing seedlings – on the other, so as to achieve "no delay in both collection and production," and the burden was fair and reasonable. Therefore, the masses reflected: "The policy is explained clearly, the burden is lighter (meaning lighter than last year), and it is fair and reasonable. We understand it, and we are happy to pay more!"
    The cadres in some individual areas indeed wanted to overcome coercion and commandism and implement policies in their work subjectively. However, they did not do a good job in investigating wheat fields and yields beforehand. When assigning tasks at each level, they knew it was not realistic, but they still assigned it rigidly. As a result, they violated the policy and became detached from the masses. For example, in Hejian County, they did not investigate the situation of wheat fields and yields well in advance, but demanded that the burden be absolutely reasonable. Therefore, the county was divided into 140 economic zones, and trivial matters were also discussed by the masses in meetings. The burden increased or decreased by only half a liter or a few grams, but meetings were held for three days, delaying production. So the peasants said: "A day's work earns a斗 of corn, and work should also be combined with hoeing seedlings!" In some areas of Jiahe, Yongnian, and Shahe counties, they did not conduct in-depth investigations and issued forms to collect statistics on wheat fields, but the more they counted, the less there was. They convened a representative meeting to assess yields without being prepared, and the lower the assessment, the less tasks were assigned. The meeting broke up before tasks were assigned. Some individual cadres in Huolu County were impatient in reporting the acreage, neglecting the principle of combining backbone elements with the masses, and did not allow for sufficient deliberation among the masses, so they launched self-reporting, forming naked dancing with only backbone elements taking the lead and no response from the masses. As a result, even the backbone elements regretted it.
    There were also individual cadres who were afraid of rectification in their minds and were afraid of making mistakes, which would add new material to the autumn rectification. Therefore, they were timid in their work and consciously lowered yields. They mistakenly believed: "If you want to implement policies and make fewer mistakes, it is best to report yields lower rather than higher, and report acreage less rather than more." For example, in Xihantun, Jiahe County, the village Party branch secretary reported 52 jin per mu, while the district secretary still asked him to report as little as possible, even though the yield was 60 jin per mu. At the representative meeting in Jize County, it was assessed that the county's average wheat yield was 78 jin per mu. The prefecture (Handan Prefecture) asked whether this would exceed the burden and violate the policy. The county then took the opportunity to say: "If we emphasize the policy, we can't squeeze out 75 jin." So they reported 60 jin, and finally reduced it to 50 jin.

### 注意反对官僚主义命令主义作风  河北省夏征工作接近完成

　　注意反对官僚主义命令主义作风
    河北省夏征工作接近完成
    掌握情况，宣传政策，克服单纯任务观点，是正确贯彻政策的三个重要环节。
    【本报讯】河北省的夏征工作即将完成。该省的夏征工作是在反对官僚主义和反对强迫命令主义的精神下进行的。六月十五日起，该省开始自上而下的布置征收工作，至七月十五日，大部地区已将任务布置到村，十五日以后，即进入紧张的交粮阶段；估计可于七月底完成入库任务。过去存在的以官僚主义和强迫命令主义的方法来完成任务的现象，已大大减少。
    根据现有的材料来看，掌握麦田和产量的情况，广泛深入地宣传政策，纠正干部的“任务与政策矛盾”的错误思想，是克服征收中的官僚主义和强迫命令主义，正确贯彻政策完成任务的三个主要环节。该省大部分地区都是这样做的，尤以石家庄专区的赵县做得最好。赵县，在历次征收中，是有名的“糟糕、乱、拖欠”的县份之一。可是，今年却在贯彻政策中，提前于七月十二日超额完成了上级给予的任务。这个成绩出现的原因，有以下几点：（一）在麦收前作了调查研究，掌握了麦田和产量的真实情况，正确地分配了各区、村的任务。（二）广泛深入地宣传了夏征政策。（三）在干部会议上，用在秋征中走群众路线，贯彻政策完成任务的十六个模范村支部的事实，和那些以强迫命令而又不能完成任务的事实对照，教育干部，纠正了“不强迫命令就不能完成任务”的错误思想。（四）党员、干部、代表带头交粮的模范行动，打破了部分群众的对抗、观望心理。（五）领导干部勤于检查，及时揭发了傅家湾村干部集体贪污，并将处理的结果通报全县；另一方面，及时通报表扬了积极负责，正确贯彻政策的姚家庄等三个村的干部。（六）各级干部在征收委员会的统一领导下，分工负责，一面组织交粮，一面领导生产——浇棉、锄苗，做到“征收生产两不误”，负担公平合理。所以群众反映说：“政策交待清楚，负担轻了（按即比去年轻），又公平合理，心里明白，多缴点也痛快！”
    个别地区的干部，主观上的确想在工作中克服强迫命令主义，贯彻政策。但事先没有做好麦地和产量的调查工作，在逐级分配任务时，明知不真实，也硬评硬挤的分配下去，结果还是违反了政策，脱离了群众。如河间县，事先没有很好调查麦地和产量情况，而要求负担绝对合理，因而把全县划为一百四十个经济区，琐碎的小事也开会让群众讨论。负担上增减不过半升几两，竟开会三天，耽误了生产，于是农民说：做一天短工一斗玉茭，搞工作也该结合锄苗呀！交河、永年、沙河等县部分地区，不深入调查，发下表格统计麦田，结果越统计越少；没准备好就开代表会评产量，结果越评越低，任务没分配就散会了。获鹿县个别干部，在自报田亩时犯急性病，忽略了骨干和群众相结合的原则，没有在群众中很好酝酿，就发动自报，形成了只有骨干带头而无群众响应的裸体跳舞。结果，骨干也后悔了。
    还有个别干部在思想上怕整风，怕犯错误后，给秋后整风添新材料。于是，在工作中束手束脚，有意识地降低产量。他们错误地认为：“要想贯彻政策，少犯错误，报产量最好宁低勿高，报地亩宁少勿多。”如交河县西旱屯，每亩产麦六十斤，村支部书记报五十二斤，区书记仍让他尽量少报。鸡泽县代表会评议全县每亩产麦七十八斤，专区（邯郸专区）问这是否超过负担，违犯政策呢？县里便乘机说：“要强调政策，七十五斤也挤不出。”于是报六十斤，最后又减到了五十斤。
