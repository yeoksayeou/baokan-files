　　In Rectification, Some Departments in the Northwest Region Failed to Grasp the Main Issues; Some Departments Gained Good Experience

　　[This newspaper dispatch] In the Northwest Region's rectification movement, the first stage corrected the phenomenon of some units starting from individual self-reflection. Now, in general, they can start from examining their work. However, another deviation has recently been discovered, which is that some large units (such as certain departments and bureaus of the Military and Political Committee, and certain departments of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, etc.) examine their work not by starting from the entire department to identify the main problems, but by focusing on general problems in small units such as sections and offices under their jurisdiction. For example, in the first stage of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Commerce's rectification, four problems were exposed: 1. The director of the department did not carefully review official documents; 2. The division of labor in the secretarial office was unclear, and there were no dedicated personnel responsible for proofreading and seal management; 3. The personnel section did not handle cadre issues promptly; 4. The head of the general affairs section was not responsible in his work, the head of the auditing section was not open to suggestions, and the head of the commercial section did not attach importance to learning, etc. These are all problems in the work, but it is impossible to see from these what problems the Department of Commerce has in mastering and implementing commercial policies, leading Shaanxi's trade work, and formulating and implementing work guidelines. Such examples exist not only in the Department of Commerce, but also in other departments. This kind of rectification method that does not grasp the main issues needs to be corrected.
    In addition, some experience has been gained in the Northwest Region's rectification, namely: 1. The heads of divisions and sections, key staff members, and branch secretaries, etc., who are middle-level cadres, should first form the core of work inspection, discuss the focus of work inspection in their units, and then take it to the group to inspire everyone to deliberate and talk freely, so it is easier to identify the main problems. 2. Some units can "check and improve at any time." For example, in the past, every official document received by the Ministry of Water Resources generally had to go through 24 procedures, so it took half a month to 20 days to handle one document, showing a serious bureaucratic style. After research, the official document procedures have been reduced to 11, and important ones do not exceed 13. Now, the fastest documents can be processed on the same day, and ordinary ones do not exceed three days. In the future, it is also decided to handle things according to their importance and urgency, instead of mechanically handling affairs. In this way, the purpose of improving work is realized, and the general cadres see that the opinions they put forward have played a role, which is encouraging, enhances their confidence in rectification, and makes it easy to create a broad mass movement for rectification.

　　西北区有些部门在整风中
    没有抓住主要问题
    有些部门在整风中获得良好经验
    【本报讯】西北区整风运动，在第一阶段纠正了某些单位从个人反省出发的现象，现在一般的都能做到从检查工作着手。但是，最近又发现了另一种偏差，就是某些大单位（如军政委员会的某些部、局以及陕西省政府某些厅等）检查工作，不是从整个部门出发，找出主要问题，而是偏重于本部门所属处、科等小单位中一般问题。如陕西省商业厅在整风第一阶段中，暴露出四个问题：一、厅长批阅公文不细心；二、秘书室分工不明确，校对和监印无专人负责；三、人事科对干部问题处理不迅速；四、庶务股长工作不负责，审计科长接受意见不虚心，商业科长不重视学习等。这些都是工作中的问题，但是并不能从这里看出商业厅在掌握与贯彻商业政策、领导陕西贸易工作以及工作方针的制定与执行上有什么问题。像这样的事例，不仅在商业厅存在，其他部门也有这种现象。像这样不是抓住主要问题的整风方法，是需要纠正的。
    此外，西北区整风中还取得一些经验，就是：一、先由处长、科长、主要科员、支部干事等中级干部，组成检查工作的核心，先商谈出本单位检查工作的重点，然后再拿到小组去启发大家酝酿漫谈，就容易检查出主要问题。二、有些单位能够做到“随时检查，随时改进。”如水利部在过去每来一件公文，一般的需经过二十四道手续，因此办理一件公文竟需半月到二十天的时间，表现出严重的文牍主义作风。经过研究后，公文手续已经减为十一道，重要的也不超过十三道。现在最快的公文，当日即可出案，普通的也超过不了三天。今后并决定根据事情轻重缓急分别处理，而不是机械地办事。这样，实现了改进工作的目的，并使一般干部看到自己所提的意见发生了作用，得到鼓舞，增强整风信心，容易把整风造成广泛的群众性运动。
