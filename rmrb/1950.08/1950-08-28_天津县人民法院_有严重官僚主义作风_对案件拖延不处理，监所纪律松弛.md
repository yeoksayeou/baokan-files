　　Tianjin County People's Court

    Has Serious Bureaucratic Work Style
    Delays in Handling Cases, Slack Discipline in Detention Centers

    [Our Newspaper] The Tianjin County People's Court in Hebei Province suffers from a serious bureaucratic work style in its leadership. It has over one hundred and twenty backlogged cases. Cases are not handled promptly or are handled improperly, preventing the government's policies on judicial work (especially the policy of suppressing counter-revolutionary elements' sabotage activities) from being effectively implemented. Although county and district cadres have repeatedly offered opinions to the court, there has not been much improvement in its work, which has caused great dissatisfaction among the masses and county, district, and village cadres. Based on the above situation, the county government held a county affairs meeting to conduct a preliminary inspection and criticism of the court's work.

  Leading cadres do not attend to important work, and many cases are delayed.

    According to the county government's inspection, the leading cadres of the Tianjin People's Court rarely attend to some important cases, often pushing the work onto the judges. When the county magistrate inspected the work of Vice President Liu Zhiren, who directly leads the court's work, Comrade Liu could only give a general overview. He did not know the details of each case, and most of them were unknown to him. Even the number of prisoners who escaped from the court from the beginning of the year to July, Comrade Liu Zhiren did not know. At the same time, the County People's Court does not inspect the work of the detention center, and there is no specific and strict system for the education of prisoners. The leadership rarely considers these issues. Although there are many serious problems in the court, the leadership always adopts a bureaucratic attitude and never considers how to solve them.

    Currently, the greatest harm to the people's vital interests comes from bandits. Since 1950, the county Public Security Bureau, in conjunction with the masses, has investigated and solved a total of eighteen murder cases involving gangs, capturing twenty ringleaders and seventy-eight bandits. When the Public Security Bureau sends the criminals to the court, the court is always unwilling to accept them, and if they are accepted, they are not handled promptly. Some cases are simply pronounced in the room and then finished. Some are sentenced but not announced to the masses. In April of last year, Wang Zhian of Shuangkou Village in the Fourth District was robbed and murdered by three bandits, including Yang Guowen. At that time, he was captured by the armed work team and handed over to the Public Security Bureau for handling, but it has not been completed for more than a year, which has caused great dissatisfaction among the local masses (especially the victims' families). Zhu Shengrui, the puppet Baochang of Xiao Zhao Beizhuang in the Second District, was reported by the masses for corruption, beating the masses, and raping four women in the village in the past. After liberation, he continued to spread rumors and undermine the masses in the village. The Public Security Bureau arrested the criminal according to law and sent the materials to the court for handling. However, the court neither read the materials nor conducted a detailed interrogation. When someone from the village guaranteed him, they released him without notifying the district or village for understanding. Later, after questioning by the masses and the Public Security Bureau, it was discovered that Zhu Shengrui was indeed guilty of many crimes, but they still did not immediately re-handle the matter, adopting a delaying attitude, so that some of the masses said that the court had been bribed, expressing great dissatisfaction.

    Because Tianjin County is a new district, cases of women being forced to death or killed due to abuse continue to occur. According to a survey from the beginning of 1950 to August alone, there were a total of fifteen cases of women being forced to death or killed, with seventeen deaths. Only three cases, including the case of a mother-in-law forcing her daughter-in-law to death in Shuanggang in the First District, were handled. The county and district women's federations have repeatedly offered opinions on the remaining cases of forced death, but they have not yet been handled. Because these cases are delayed, the result is that many similar cases continue to occur.

  The discipline of the detention center is lax, and there is still a feudal cell boss rule.

    For the management of detention centers, leading cadres also adopt a bureaucratic attitude and rarely go to the detention centers to understand and inspect the situation. Many principled errors have existed for a long time and have not been corrected. The discipline of the detention center guards is lax. Sometimes the guards are completely asleep at night, and the guns are left unattended in the room. A clerk of the court casually gives the family of an important criminal a note from the president to meet the prisoner, without notifying the president. This is a serious phenomenon of disorganization and indiscipline.

    In the detention center, the feudal rule of the cell boss still exists. According to the current situation in the detention center, there are more than one hundred and seventy prisoners in adjudicated or unadjudicated cases. The court organizes them to produce, but the management of these prisoners' production is a feudal local tyrant landlord, who was a major criminal who oppressed the masses and plundered the villagers as the deputy township head of the Kuomintang before liberation; the person in charge of the accounts is also a criminal local tyrant landlord, and also the district leader of the Three People's Principles Youth League. The court actually allowed them to rule everything in the detention center. Every day, the two of them do not work in the detention center and can freely enter and exit the gate of the detention center. When the prisoners are producing, everyone is not afraid when the guards go, but when the two of them go, the prisoners are terribly afraid.

    There is also no discipline in the supervision of prisoners. For example, when planting rice seedlings, the court sent a guard to take eight prisoners to Xiaozhan, which is fifty miles away from the detention center, to work as short-term laborers to plant rice seedlings. During the day, he took them to plant rice seedlings, and at night, the guard found a place to sleep by himself, and told the prisoners to go home to sleep or find a place to sleep by themselves. Another example is Zhang Guilin, the ringleader of a gang of bandits whose interrogation has just been completed by the Public Security Bureau and who has been prosecuted. He was transferred to the court one day and asked to go out to produce the next day. Under this situation, from the beginning of 1950 to July, as many as sixteen prisoners escaped (including a murderer who killed six people). After the prisoners escaped, they did not think of investigating and capturing them. A prisoner in the Second District who often stole escaped and is now at home, but he is not held accountable.

### 天津县人民法院  有严重官僚主义作风  对案件拖延不处理，监所纪律松弛

　　天津县人民法院
    有严重官僚主义作风
    对案件拖延不处理，监所纪律松弛
    【本报讯】河北天津县人民法院在领导上存在严重的官僚主义作风，积压案件一百二十余件，处理案件不及时或处理不得当，使政府对司法工作的政策（特别是镇压反革命分子破坏活动的政策）不能很好贯彻下去。县、区干部虽曾不断向法院提出意见，但该院工作仍无多大改进，因此引起群众及县、区、村干部极大不满。根据以上情况，县政府召开县务会议，对法院工作初步进行了检查与批评。
  领导干部对重要工作不过问，许多案件拖延不处理。
    根据县政府的检查，天津人民法院领导干部对一些重要的案件很少过问，往往把工作推到审判员身上。当该县县长检查直接领导法院工作的副院长刘志仁同志的工作时，刘同志只能说个大概情况，究竟每个案件的详细情形如何，绝大部分均不知道。连今年年初到七月份法院跑了多少犯人，刘志仁同志也不知道。同时，县人民法院对监所的工作也不检查，对犯人教育没有一定的严密制度，而领导上亦很少考虑这些问题。虽然法院中存在着许多严重问题，领导上始终抱着官僚主义的态度，从不考虑如何解决。
    当前对人民切身利益危害最大的是土匪。该县自一九五○年以来，经公安局结合群众侦察破案的伙杀案件共十八起，捕获匪首二十名，匪徒七十八名。当公安局将匪犯送交法院时，法院总是不愿接收，收了也不抓紧处理。有些案件只是在屋子里宣判了就完事。有的判了罪也不向群众公布。去年四月间四区双口村王治安被杨国文等三名匪徒路劫害命，当时经武工队捕获，由公安局交法院处理，直到现在一年多，仍未处理完毕，因此引起当地群众（尤其被害户）极大不满。二区小赵北庄伪保长朱升瑞，被群众检举过去在村贪污、打骂群众、强奸四个妇女，解放后仍在村里造谣破坏，继续欺压群众。公安局依法将该犯逮捕，连同材料一同送法院处理。而法院既没看材料，也没详细审讯，村中来了个人一保，也没通知区、村进行了解即放出去了。后经群众及公安局追问，结果一看材料才知道朱升瑞确实罪恶多端，但是仍不马上从新处理，采取拖延态度，以致有的群众说法院受了贿赂，表示极大不满。
    天津县因系新区，妇女因受虐待被逼死、害死的案件不断发生。仅据一九五○年初至八月份的调查，妇女被逼死或害死的案件共十五件，死亡者十七人，仅一区双港婆婆逼死媳妇等三件进行了处理，其余逼死人命案件经县、区妇联会再三提出意见，至今仍未处理。因为这些案件拖延不处理，结果使许多与此类似的案件仍然不断发生。
  监所纪律松弛，并存在着封建的牢头统治。
    对于监所的管理工作，领导干部也是采取官僚主义的态度，很少到监所进行了解及检查，好多原则性的错误长期存在，未加纠正。监所的看守班纪律松弛。看守员有时晚上完全睡觉，枪就在屋子里放着无人看管。法院的一个文书随便给一个重要案犯家属开院长的条子去接见犯人，并可以不通知院长。这是严重的无组织无纪律的现象。
    在监所里，封建的牢头统治依然存在。根据监所目前的情况，已决或未决案件的犯人共有一百七十余人，由法院组织他们生产，但管理这些犯人生产的是一个封建恶霸地主，解放前是国民党的大乡副乡长，欺压群众渔肉乡民的大罪犯；管理账目的也是一个犯罪的恶霸地主，又是三青团的区队长，而法院竟让他们两人在监所统治一切。每天他两人在监所里不劳动，并可自由出入监所的大门。在犯人生产的时候，看守员去了大家不害怕，而他两人去了犯人都害怕得了不得。
    在对犯人的看管上也毫无纪律。如在插稻秧时，法院派出一个看守员带着八个犯人到离监所五十里地的小站一带去打短工插秧。白天带着他们去插秧，晚上看守员自己找个地方睡觉，叫犯人分别回家睡觉或自找地方睡觉。又如公安局刚刚侦讯终结提起公诉的伙匪匪首张桂林，头一天转解法院，第二天即叫他出去生产。在此种情况下，从一九五○年初至七月份这个期间，逃跑犯人即达十六名之多（内有杀害六条人命的凶犯一名）。犯人跑了之后亦不想法侦察捕捉。二区有个经常偷盗的犯人逃跑了，现在在家里，也不追究。（刘晋峰）
