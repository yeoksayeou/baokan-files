Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, and the All-China Student Federation today issued a statement protesting the crimes of American imperialism in bombing the Korean people. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Since launching its war of aggression against the Korean people, American imperialism has encountered resolute resistance from the heroic Korean people and the Korean People's Army, who are defending their motherland's independence and freedom, and is suffering defeat after defeat. In order to salvage its doomed fate, the American aggressors are using their air force to carry out inhuman and barbaric bombings of cities, schools, hospitals, residential areas, and industrial zones in the rear of Korea, and are massacring peaceful residents on a large scale.

This heinous behavior of the American aggressors is intolerable to every peace-loving people in the world. We – the Chinese people who have suffered long-term oppression and trampling by imperialism – express our firm protest against this extremely sinful behavior of the United States. We express our full support for the statement issued by Korean Foreign Minister Park on August 5, demanding that the Security Council stop the crimes of the U.S. military; we express our utmost concern for the Korean people, and are willing to do everything in our power to support the Korean people's just struggle for the reunification and independence of their motherland.

We firmly believe that the Korean people, who have achieved brilliant victories, will never be intimidated by these barbaric acts of the American bandits; on the contrary, it will increase their hatred and strengthen their courage and strength to fight. Peace-loving people all over the world stand on the side of the just Korean people. The Korean people will surely victoriously drive all the American aggressors out of Korean territory. Victory will surely belong to the Korean people under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung!

All-China Federation of Trade Unions, All-China Democratic Women's Federation, All-China Democratic Youth Federation, All-China Student Federation.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Chinese People's Committee Against American Aggression in Taiwan and Korea issued a statement today protesting the U.S. aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities in Korea. The statement said:

After suffering a serious blow in launching its war of aggression against Korea, U.S. imperialism wantonly and indiscriminately bombed peaceful cities in Korea, brutally destroying the lives and property of the Korean people. This frenzied behavior, which violates international law and humanity, not only shows that the American imperialists have lost their humanity, but also reflects how cowardly and incompetent they are in the face of the People's Army.

We fully support the statement of Korean Foreign Minister Park Heon-yeong on August 5 and strongly protest this violation of international law by U.S. imperialism. We demand that the United Nations Security Council take swift action to stop the crimes of the American interventionists in Korea.

　　中华全国总工会等四团体
    抗议美国轰炸朝鲜人民
    中国人民反对美国侵略委员会亦提出抗议
    【新华社十日讯】中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇联、中华全国民主青联、中华全国学联四团体，今日发表声明，抗议美帝国主义轰炸朝鲜人的罪行。声明全文如下：
    美国帝国主义自发动对朝鲜人民的侵略战争以来，遭遇到了英勇保卫自己祖国的独立和自由的朝鲜人民与朝鲜人民军的坚决反击，正一败再败。美国侵略者为了挽救其失败命运，正用他们的空军对朝鲜后方的城市、学校、医院、住宅和工业区，进行其惨无人道的野蛮轰炸，大规模地屠杀和平的居民。
    美国侵略者这种罪恶滔天的行为，是全世界每个爱好和平的人民所不能容忍的。我们——曾身受帝国主义长期压迫和蹂躏的中国人民，对美国这种罪大恶极的行为，表示坚决的抗议。我们对八月五日朝鲜朴外长要求安理会制止美军罪行的声明。表示完全拥护；对朝鲜人民表示莫大的关怀，并愿尽一切力量，支援朝鲜人民正义的、为祖国统一和独立的斗争。
    我们坚信：取得了辉煌胜利的朝鲜人民，绝不会被这些美国强盗的野蛮行为所吓倒，相反地，更会增加他们的憎恨，更加强他们战斗的勇气和力量。全世界爱好和平的人民都站在正义的朝鲜人民方面。朝鲜人民一定能胜利地把美国侵略者全部赶出朝鲜的国土。胜利一定属于在金日成将军领导下的朝鲜人民！
    中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会。
    【新华社十日讯】中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会，今日发表声明，抗议美国飞机滥炸朝鲜和平城市的暴行。声明称：
    美帝国主义发动对朝鲜的侵略战争遭受到严重打击后，肆意滥炸朝鲜的和平城市，残暴地毁坏朝鲜人民的生命和财产。这种违反国际法、违反人道的疯狂行为，不仅表示美帝国主义者已经丧失人性，而且反映了它在人民军队面前是如何的懦弱无能。
    我们完全支持朝鲜外长朴宪永八月五日的声明，并严重抗议美帝国主义这种违反国际法的暴行。我们要求联合国安全理事会迅速采取行动，制止美国干涉者在朝鲜的罪行。
