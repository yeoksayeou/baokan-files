　　Checking Work to Clarify Rectification Focus
    CPC Shulu County Committee Prepares for Rectification
    [Our Newspaper] In order to clarify the focus of rectification and formulate a rectification plan, the CPC Shulu County Committee in Hebei Province initially reviewed its current work in accordance with the spirit of the CPC Central Committee's rectification instructions. The county party committee dispatched inspection teams to the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts on June 18 to inspect leadership work. Subsequently, the county party committee conducted a preliminary review of its past work and solicited opinions from people's representatives through representative conferences from all walks of life. Through repeated inspections, the Shulu County Committee discovered the following problems in its work:

    I. Lack of systematic investigation and research, such as regular and in-depth inspection work. As a result, they did not understand the situation at the grassroots level and could not act according to the specific circumstances below. When assigning tasks, they only demanded the completion of tasks, pursued figures, and did not explain policies clearly, and lacked concrete methods. For example, during the first quarter tax collection this year, the county party committee did not conduct serious research but instead instructed the relevant departments and bureaus to proceed at their discretion. At that time, the relevant departments and bureaus did not understand the situation either and wanted to quickly distribute the tasks, so they allocated the tasks based on the number of industrial and commercial households in the fourth quarter of last year. In reality, there had been many changes in industrial and commercial households from last winter to this spring. The result, of course, did not match the actual situation, and there were cases of excessive lightness or heaviness in taxation. Before spring cotton planting, the prefectural committee issued a call to exceed the target, and the county party committee rashly arranged to exceed the original target by 72,000 mu (the original target was 285,000 mu). Some districts even proposed to exceed the target by one time, so some villages, in order to complete the task, used coercive measures to collect the grain sowing tools of the masses and leave the cotton sowing tools to sow cotton. As a result, it aroused dissatisfaction among the masses.

    II. Not concerned about the interests of the masses. Problems raised by the masses were not resolved in a timely manner, or were simply delayed or perfunctorily dealt with irresponsibly. After the land certificates were issued in Beoweijing Village, Third District, the village cadres moved the house of middle peasant Zhang Shuzhuang. At that time, the county party committee instructed the district to return the house, but because the district and village cadres could not be convinced, it was delayed. Later, it was not until the village cadres demolished Zhang Shuzhuang's house that the county arrested the village cadres. As a result, it violated the policy and damaged the village cadres. On the issue of cotton seed loans, more than 1.2 million catties of cotton seeds were lent out throughout the county, but because no germination tests were carried out before the loans were issued, some of the cotton seeds were moldy, so the emergence was uneven, which greatly affected the prestige of the Party and the People's Government in leading production.

    III. The leadership's bureaucratic work style was very serious. The county party committee was busy all day long going up and down, running around, and when problems were discovered, they were dealt with on a case-by-case basis, without research or being good at using organizational forces to solve the central problem. The county party committee meetings to study work were often just oral discussions, and then the spirit was conveyed to the districts. Because the cadres' understanding was different, the spirit conveyed to the districts was also inconsistent. After the work was completed, they were not good at summarizing experience. Sometimes writing summaries was also for the sake of "completing the task," rarely starting from improving work.

    IV. The county party committee's democratic style was not enough, and it rarely sought the opinions of lower-level cadres on the leadership. Sometimes it even suppressed criticism. For example, during the ideological review of cadres in February this year, the county party committee asked everyone to raise many opinions, but when answering these questions, they were all negated. And said: "This is to see the county party committee as a mass of darkness." Afterwards, everyone said: "Don't raise any more opinions in the future."

    After the Shulu County Committee checked out these problems, in addition to continuing to conduct in-depth inspections in the rectification, it first set out the following improvement measures: (1) Strengthen the collective leadership of the county party committee, in addition to studying the central work, and also plan to study the work of various departments. (2) When assigning tasks and handling problems, follow the mass line. And regularly and systematically carry out inspection work, summarize work. (3) Discover problems through inspection work, deal with them in a timely manner, and overcome procrastination. (4) Often use all possible occasions to solicit the opinions of lower-level cadres and the masses on the leadership to improve work.

### 检查工作明确整风重点  中共束鹿县委作好整风准备工作

　　检查工作明确整风重点
    中共束鹿县委作好整风准备工作
    【本报讯】中共河北省束鹿县委会，为明确整风重点，制订整风计划，曾根据中共中央整风指示的精神，初步检查了当前工作。该县县委曾于六月十八日派出检查组，分赴三、四、六区检查领导工作。随后县委对过去工作作了一次初步检查。并通过各界代表会征求人民代表意见。经过这样反复检查，束鹿县委发现了工作中存在着如下一些问题：
    一、缺乏系统的调查研究，如经常的进行切实深入的检查工作，因此，不了解下情，不能按下面的具体情况办事；布置工作时，只要求完成任务，追求数字，讲不清政策，而又具体办法少。如今年进行第一季税收时，县委并未认真研究，而是责成主管科、局酌情进行。当时主管科、局亦不了解情况，又要很快分配下去，便根据去年第四季的工商户分配了任务。实际上从去冬到今春工商户已有不少变化。结果当然与实际情况不符，发生了畸轻畸重的现象。春季棉花播种前，地委提出超任务的号召，县委便冒然布置超原任务七万二千亩（原任务为二十八万五千亩）；有的区竟提出要超过一倍，以致有些村子为了完成任务，而用强迫命令的办法，把群众的种粮耧收起来，留下种棉的耧种棉。结果引起群众不满。
    二、不关怀群众利益，群众提出的问题，不及时解决，或根本不负责任的拖延搪塞。三区北位井村发土地证后，村干部又动了中农张书庄的房子。当时县委曾指示区上应将房子退回，但因区村干部思想搞不通，就拖延下来。后来直到该村村干部将张书庄的房子拆毁后，县里才将村干部扣起来。结果违犯了政策，又损坏了村干部。在贷棉种问题上，全县贷出棉籽一百二十余万斤，但由于贷放前未进行发芽试验，其中有些棉籽已经霉烂，因此出苗不齐，大大影响了党与人民政府领导生产的威信。
    三、领导上事务主义作风非常严重，县委整天忙于上来下去，东奔西跑，发现问题便就事论事，不研究，也不善于使用组织力量，和解决中心问题。县委开会研究工作，往往口头讲讲，就回区传达。因为干部领会程度不同，给各区传达精神也就不一致。等到工作结束后，又不善于总结经验。有时写总结，也是为了“完成任务”，很少从改进工作出发。
    四、县委的民主作风不够，很少征求下层干部对领导上的意见。甚至有时还压制批评。如今年二月进行干部思想检查时，县委让大家提了不少意见，可是在解答这些问题时又都否定了。并说：“这样是把县委看成黑漆一团。”事后大家说：“以后可别提意见了。”
    束鹿县委检查出这些问题后，除了在整风中继续深入进行检查外，并先定出以下几点改进办法：（一）加强县委集体领导，除研究中心工作外，并有计划的研究各部门工作。（二）布置工作处理问题，要走群众路线。并经常的有计划的进行检查工作，总结工作。（三）通过检查工作发现问题，及时处理，克服拖拉作风。（四）经常利用一切可能利用的场合，征询下层干部和群众对领导上的意见，改进工作。（中共束鹿县县委副书记张君实，通讯干事刘根茂）
