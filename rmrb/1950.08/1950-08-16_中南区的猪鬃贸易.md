　　Pig Bristle Trade in Central and Southern China
　　By our special correspondent, Xiao Hang

　　Hankou maintains close connections with the major pig bristle producing areas of Central and Southern China, including Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Jiangxi. Hankou's No. 17 bristles have a good reputation in the international market, on par with Shanghai's No. 70 bristles and Tianjin's Improved No. 55 bristles. Therefore, although the Central and Southern China Pig Bristle Company also deals in various livestock products such as cattle hides and casings, its main focus is on the purchase and sale of pig bristles.

　　According to the Central and Southern China Pig Bristle Company, in the first half of this year, it has completed 91 percent of its annual purchase plan for No. 17 bristles and 63 percent for No. 5 bristles. In terms of exports, it has completed 22 percent of its annual plan for No. 17 bristles and 39 percent for No. 5 bristles. In total, it has invested 66.94 billion yuan in the purchase of pig bristles, hides, and other products, and has earned a portion of foreign exchange through foreign sales. Thus, the Central and Southern China Pig Bristle Company has played a significant role in implementing the policy of urban-rural cooperation and domestic-foreign exchange.

　　The Central and Southern China Pig Bristle Company was established on October 19th of last year and now has three branches in Zhengzhou, Changsha, and Guangzhou. The company's most outstanding business achievement is the purchase of pig bristles. In the first six months of this year, the Central and Southern China Pig Bristle Company has purchased 8,820 dan (1 dan equals 121 jin) in Hankou, and it is expected that it will completely exceed the pre-liberation figures by the end of the year.

　　In the past, the Central and Southern China Pig Bristle Company's purchasing business was mainly conducted through small producers. These small producers included urban handicraftsmen, small vendors, and some processing workers. In the past, when private pig bristle companies were operating, they only accepted whole boxes of goods. Each box had to be equipped according to certain dimensions: from 2 inches to 6 inches, every 2.5 li was a number, for a total of 17 numbers, weighing one dan. Generally, small producers had little or no capital and were unable to operate independently, so they could only work for large merchants. After the establishment of the Central and Southern China Pig Bristle Company, it established a policy of supporting small producers, regardless of whether they had half a jin or a jin and a half, it would purchase the goods, and then the company would process and assemble them into boxes. This greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of small producers to go to the countryside to purchase. However, they still had very little capital. After repeated research, the pig bristle company decided to issue loans, totaling more than 10 billion yuan. By the Dragon Boat Festival this year, all of the loans were recovered, with no bad debts. Because pig bristles are a unified sales commodity, and the company is the only one, everyone is willing to abide by the company's credit in order to do business. When the company issued loans, it also took care of private interests in many ways, so everyone made money, and repaying the loans was very smooth. Now, the pig bristle industry in Hankou, including processing workers, is close to 800 households (there were more than 140 after the victory of the War of Resistance). They all made money, with a general net profit of about 10 percent, and some reaching as high as 50 percent.

　　Another method of acquisition used by the pig bristle company is to organize and rely on cooperatives, which is a developing method. Initially, some large merchants wanted to exploit loopholes and organize fake cooperatives to evade taxes. After being exposed by the pig bristle company, they specifically tried to sabotage the establishment of cooperatives. When the pig bristle company organized a cooperative in Sanyanqiao Village in the suburbs, this situation became very clear. Originally, the farmers in Sanyanqiao had always sold semi-finished products to large merchants, because during the period of food shortages, they had to borrow money from large merchants and had to endure heavy exploitation: (1) prices were too low, generally 20 percent lower than the market price; (2) they were cheated by large scales; (3) good goods could only be sold as inferior goods, and inferior goods could only be sold as bad goods. Therefore, large merchants were even more opposed to the establishment of cooperatives, and they seized on the weakness of the cooperative's lack of funds and spread the word: "I heard that the cooperative is going to buy goods, I'll take dozens of dan to sell first." Dozens of dan is several thousand jin, calculated at 240,000 yuan per jin for 6-inch colored bristle at the time, 1,000 jin is 240 million yuan. The big merchants thought that "the cooperative can be crushed with just one squeeze." However, the pig bristle company supported the cooperative, forcing the big merchants to try a new trick, shouting to buy at 20 percent higher than the cooperative's price, in an attempt to make the cooperative unable to do business and collapse. However, the cooperative's price is consistent with the pig bristle company's list price. If the big merchants bought at a high price, they could only sell to the pig bristle company at the list price, which would inevitably lead to losses. Therefore, all the big merchants' schemes failed. The cooperative slowly developed and gave the pig bristle company strong support in its business. For example, the company signed a contract with a foreign merchant, and because of time and other constraints, it was not possible to deliver the finished products immediately, but the deadline for delivery was approaching. Some large merchants, upon hearing this news, immediately raised the price of each box of pig bristles by 500,000 yuan, in an attempt to squeeze the pig bristle company. At that time, the cooperative accepted the pig bristle company's order at the market price and completed it five days in advance.

　　The pig bristle company believes that sending teams to the countryside is an important method of acquisition. The role of these teams is: first, to save farmers from the hardship of long journeys, saving labor and expenses, and accelerating capital turnover; second, to help bring currency to the countryside, so that farmers do not have to sell pig bristles in Hankou and bring goods back, so that the money is always circulating in the Hankou market; third, to help farmers in the producing areas organize cooperatives, establish roots, and facilitate more planned purchases and sales in the future. However, due to limited manpower, not many of these teams have been sent out.

　　As a result of adopting these many methods, the pig bristle company's acquisition plan has been guaranteed to be successfully completed.

　　At present, the pig bristle industry in Central and Southern China, along with the development of the number of households, has brought some new problems. The main problem is that the concentration of operations has decreased and the dispersion has increased, and the specifications of products are not uniform. With more households, it is also difficult for the government to manage. Some businesses that have not joined the guild are not subject to restrictions, which also has an adverse impact on legitimate merchants. Therefore, the pig bristle company is preparing to suggest that the government review pig bristle businesses and advise those with too low technical level and no capital to change careers. For general small producers, it will find ways to organize them, implement joint operations, or establish production cooperatives.

　　At the same time, the pig bristle company should pay attention to uniting private merchants to carry out acquisition work, so that the pig bristle trade in Central and Southern China can be further developed under the correct policy of taking both public and private interests into account.

### 中南区的猪鬃贸易

　　中南区的猪鬃贸易
    本报特派记者  萧航
    汉口和猪鬃主要产地——四川、湖南、湖北、河南、陕西、江西等地保持着密切的联系。汉口的十七号鬃，在国际市场上有很好的信誉，和上海的七十分鬃、天津的改良五十五号鬃有同等地位。所以，中南猪鬃公司虽兼营牛皮、肠衣等各种畜产品，业务重点却是购销猪鬃。
    根据中南猪鬃公司的材料，在今年上半年，已完成十七号鬃全年收购计划的百分之九十一，五号鬃的百分之六十三。在出口方面，已完成十七号鬃全年计划的百分之二十二，五号鬃的百分之三十九。总计在猪鬃、皮货等收购中投放资金六百六十九亿四千万元，并经过外销换取了一部分外汇。这样，中南猪鬃公司在执行城乡互助、内外交流的政策中，已经起了相当的作用。
    中南猪鬃公司于去年十月十九日成立，现已有郑州、长沙、广州三个分公司。该公司最突出的业务成绩是猪鬃的收购工作。今年上半年的六个月中，中南猪鬃公司已在汉口收购八千八百二十关担（每关担一百二十一市斤），预计年底完全可以超过解放前的数字。
    在过去一段时间里，中南猪鬃公司的收购业务，主要是通过小生产者来进行的。这些小生产者包括了城市手工业者、小商贩和一部分加工工人。过去在私人开办猪鬃公司的时候，一向是只收整箱子货。每箱须按一定尺寸配备好：从二寸起到六寸止，每隔二分五厘是一号，共是十七号，重一关担。一般小生产者没有或者很少资金，无力经营，只能去给大商人作工。中南猪鬃公司成立以后，确定了扶助小生产者的方针，不论一斤半斤，有货就收，然后由公司加工搭配成箱。这曾大大鼓励了小生产者下乡收购的积极性。但是，他们依然很少资金。经过了再三的研究，猪鬃公司决定发放贷款，总共发放了一百多亿元。到今年端午节，一律收回了，没有一笔呆账。因为猪鬃是统销物资，公司只有一家，大家全愿意对公司遵守信用，好做生意。公司在发放贷款的时候，又曾多方面照顾了私人利益，结果大家全赚了钱，还账也就很顺当。现在，汉口的猪鬃业，连加工工人算在一起，已近八百家（抗战胜利后是一百四十多家）。他们全赚了钱，一般纯利在百分之十左右，高的达到了百分之五十。
    猪鬃公司的另一种收购方法，是组织并倚靠合作社，这是正在发展中的一种方法。最初，有些大商人想钻空子，组织假合作社来逃避税收。经猪鬃公司揭露后，他们即专门来破坏建立合作社。当猪鬃公司在郊区三眼桥村组织合作社的时候，这种情形就看的很清楚了。本来，三眼桥的农民，一向是把半成品卖给大商人的，因为在青黄不接期间，要向大商人贷款，不得不经受苛重的剥削：（一）价格过低，一般要低于市价百分之二十。（二）受大秤的坑骗。（三）好货只能当次货卖，次货只能当坏货卖。因而大商人对合作社的建立更是反对，他们就抓住合作社资金少的弱点，放出风声说：“听说合作社要收货，我先拿几十担去卖卖。”几十担就是几千斤，按当时六寸花色毛鬃二十四万元一斤计算，一千斤就是两亿四千万元。大商人以为“合作社一挤就能给挤垮”。但是，猪鬃公司支持了合作社，使大商人不得不又翻了个新花样，叫喊高出合作社价格的百分之二十收购，企图叫合作社作不成生意而垮台。但是，合作社的价格和猪鬃公司的牌价是一致的，如果大商人高价收购了，只能按牌价卖给猪鬃公司；必致招致赔本的结果。所以，大商人的计谋全失败了。合作社慢慢地发展起来了，在业务上，曾给了猪鬃公司以有力的支持。如公司和外商签订了一个合同，因为时间和其他条件的限制，急切还不能把成品交出去，可是，交货的期限是迫近了。有些大商人一听到这个消息，每箱猪鬃的价格，立即提高了五十万元，企图敲一下猪鬃公司。当时合作社按照市价接受了猪鬃公司的定货，而且提前五天完成了。
    猪鬃公司认为，派遣小组下乡，是一种重要的收购方式。这种小组的作用是：第一，使农民避免了长途跋涉之苦，既可节省劳力、开支，又能加速资金周转。第二，帮助货币下乡，免得农民来汉卖了猪鬃，带货回去，使票子老是在汉口市场流转。第三，帮助产区农民组织合作社，扎下根子，便于将来更有计划地进行购销。不过，限于人力，这种小组派下去的还不多。
    采用了这许多方法的结果，猪鬃公司的收购计划得到了顺利完成的保证。
    目前，中南区的猪鬃业，随同户数的发展，带来了一些新的问题。主要是经营的集中性减少，分散性增大，产品的规格不统一。户数多了，政府管理起来也困难。一部分没有加入公会的业户，经营不受限制，也给正当商人以不利影响。因此，猪鬃公司准备建议政府，对猪鬃业者加以审查，凡是技术水平太低，没有资金的，劝他们转业。对一般的小生产者，则设法组织起来，实行联营，或者建立生产合作社。
    同时，猪鬃公司应注意团结私商进行收购工作，使中南区的猪鬃贸易，在公私兼顾的正确政策下，更加发展起来。
