Xinhua News Agency, 27th: The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a circular on June 15 to all levels of people's governments, prohibiting residents along railway lines from cutting down trees beside the roads. Planting trees along railway lines was originally intended to consolidate road embankments, prevent floods, regulate the climate, and beautify the lines, directly and indirectly benefiting agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy. This tree planting work has been largely completed along the railway lines; however, residents along the lines do not pay enough attention to protecting the roadside trees, and incidents of breaking branches, digging roots, and felling often occur, preventing the planted trees from growing. To this end, the Government Administration Council specifically issued a circular to all levels of people's governments to post notices prohibiting the felling of trees along railway lines, and to conduct extensive publicity and education among the residents along the lines, so that they can consciously assist railway personnel in jointly undertaking the responsibility of maintaining the trees.

　　政务院发出通令
    铁路沿线禁伐树木
    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府政务院曾于六月十五日通令各级人民政府，禁止铁路沿线居民砍伐路旁树木。铁路沿线种植树木，原是为了巩固路堤，防止水患，调节气候，美化线路，直接间接对于农林水利都有裨益。此项植树工作，已在铁路沿线大部完成；但沿线居民对爱护路树，不够重视，时常发生折枝、掘根、砍伐等情事，致使栽好的树木不能长成。为此，政务院特通令各级人民政府在铁路沿线张贴禁止砍伐树木的布告，并向沿线居民作广泛的宣传教育，俾使他们能够自觉地协助铁路人员，共同担负起养护树木的责任。
