　　Can a Private Factory Apply for a Loan from the People's Bank?
    Answer to Worker Wang Fengsong

    Editor:
    I am a machine worker in a flour mill. Now I plan to open a flour mill with four other people. Can I apply for a loan from the government? If so, what procedures are required?
    Wang Fengsong, August 10th

    Comrade Wang Fengsong:
    The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China answers your question as follows:
    Currently, the purpose of our bank's loans to industry and commerce is to develop production and prosper the economy. Therefore, the principle of lending is: "All industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood should be given loans based on the current degree of the people's need for them, giving priority to those that are more important and urgent, in order to help them develop." That is to say, factories applying for loans from the bank must have their own means of production and working capital. The bank can provide loans to support factories when they temporarily encounter difficulties in capital turnover during the production process. If they have no capital of their own and rely entirely on bank loans to open a factory, the bank cannot provide loans.

　　私人设厂可向人民银行申请贷款吗？
    答工人王凤松问编辑同志：
    我是一个磨粉厂的机器工人，现在准备四个人合开一个面粉厂，是否可向政府申请贷款？如果可以的话，需要什么手续？
    王凤松八月十日
    王凤松同志：
    来信所提问题，由中国人民银行北京分行答复如下：
    目前我行对工商业的贷款目的是为了发展生产、繁荣经济。所以贷款的原则是：“凡有利于国计民生的工商业，根据目前人民对其需要的程度，分别轻重缓急，在现有的基础上给以贷款，以帮助其发展”。也就是说，向银行申请贷款的工厂，自己必须有生产工具及流动资本。在生产过程中临时发生资金周转不灵时，银行可以贷款扶植。如本身没有资本，专赖银行借款开工厂，银行是不能贷款的。
