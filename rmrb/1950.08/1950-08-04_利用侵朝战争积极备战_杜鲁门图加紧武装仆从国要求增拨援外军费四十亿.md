　　Utilizing the Korean War of Aggression to Actively Prepare for War
    Truman Attempts to Intensify the Arming of Puppet States, Demands an Additional Four Billion in Foreign Aid Military Spending
    [Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] The American government is continuing to exploit the war of aggression against Korea that it launched, in order to carry out its plot of exporting crisis and expanding the scope of war. According to a Washington dispatch from the United States Information Service on the 1st: After Truman requested Congress to allocate an additional $10.5 billion for the production of munitions and the expansion of armed forces, he has now sent a letter to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, requesting an additional $4 billion to be added to the so-called "Mutual Defense Assistance Program" that was recently passed by Congress, which is about three times larger than the original plan.
    In his message, in addition to issuing the clichéd platitudes about so-called "American security" and the "free world" being threatened, Truman frankly admitted that one significance of shipping military equipment to other countries is to avoid "large-scale increases" in domestic stockpiles. Truman revealed in his message that the main purpose of the United States' military "aid" to other so-called "free countries" is to drive these countries to serve as cannon fodder for the United States. In Truman's words, it is "to enable them (note: referring to the so-called 'free countries') to make the greatest contribution to common defense." Truman also admitted that expanding military production and expanding the army—which American imperialism is also ordering its puppet states to accelerate—"will create a serious economic burden," but he demanded that they "shoulder this burden" and do their best to do so in a "shorter period than originally planned."
    The allocation of the new appropriations requested by Truman is as follows: $3.504 billion for the North Atlantic region, $193 million for Greece, Turkey, and Iran, and $303 million for the Pacific region, including the continuation of the war of aggression in Korea.

    杜鲁门图加紧武装仆从国要求增拨援外军费四十亿
    【新华社三日讯】美国政府正继续利用它所发动的侵略朝鲜的战争，以遂行其输出危机和扩大战争范围的图谋。据美国新闻处华盛顿一日消息：杜鲁门在要求国会增拨一百零五亿美元生产军火及扩大武装部队之用以后，顷又致函众院议长，要求再拨四十亿美元加于不久以前才经国会通过的所谓“联防援助计划”中，这个数目比原计划的数目约大三倍。
    杜鲁门在咨文中，除了发出所谓“美国安全”及“自由世界”受到威胁的陈词谰调之外，坦白地承认把军事装备输往别的国家的一个意义，就是避免国内存货的“大量增加”。杜鲁门在咨文中透露：美国对其他所谓“自由国家”进行军事“援助”的主要目的，就是要驱使这些国家充当美国的炮灰。用杜鲁门的话说，就是“要使它们（按：指所谓‘自由国家’）对共同防御作最大的贡献”。杜鲁门也承认，扩大军备生产及扩大军队——像美国帝国主义又勒令其仆从国家加速进行的——“将造成严重的经济负担”，但他却要求它们“担起这个负担”，而且要在“比原定计划为短的时期内”尽力为之。
    杜鲁门所要求的新拨款的分配如下：北大西洋地区三十五亿零四百万，希腊、土耳其及伊朗一亿九千三百万，三亿零三百万用于太平洋地区，包括继续朝鲜的侵略战争。
