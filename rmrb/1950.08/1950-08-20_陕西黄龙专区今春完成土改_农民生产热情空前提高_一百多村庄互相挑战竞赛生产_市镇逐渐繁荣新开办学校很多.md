Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th: Since the completion of land reform in the rural areas of the Huanglong Special District in Shaanxi Province this spring, the production enthusiasm of farmers has greatly increased.

The Huanglong Special District is located on the west bank of the Yellow River, north of the Guanzhong Plain, and administers counties such as Huanglong, Huangling, Luochuan, Yichuan, and Yijun around Huanglong Mountain. The land is barren, the people are poor, and the population is sparse. Many of the farmers in this area are refugees who fled from Henan during the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan. They reclaimed wasteland for farming and suffered extremely heavy exploitation by local feudal landlords. Before liberation, the Hu Zongnan bandit troops used this area as a base for blockading and attacking the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Area, and for more than a decade, they brutally plundered the farmers in the counties of this district. Therefore, when the district was liberated in 1948, the poverty of the farmers reached its extreme. The farmers' production morale was also at its lowest.

After liberation, the rural areas of the district underwent rent reduction in the winter of 1948 and land reform from last winter to this spring, and now have a completely new look. The farmers who have obtained land have unprecedented production enthusiasm. Farmers have actively organized to carry out mutual aid in labor exchange. According to statistics from Luochuan, Yijun, and Huangling counties, more than 60 percent of male and female farmers were organized during this year's summer harvest. At present, at least more than 100 villages in the entire district are engaged in production competitions that challenge each other. This year, Luochuan, Huangling, Yijun and other three counties have reclaimed more than 25,700 mu of wasteland, exceeding the original plan by more than 7,000 mu. The planting area of ​​crops such as cotton and hemp promoted by the people's government has also exceeded the plan. About 60% of the autumn fields in the special area were fertilized about twice as much as before the land reform, and deep plowing and careful cultivation were carried out for three times. The number of draft animals has also increased by more than 400. The other two phenomena after land reform are: towns and markets have prospered, and many new schools have been opened. This year, farmers in the special district have added and repaired more than 37,000 pieces of farm tools, so the handicrafts in the towns have been restored. This year, the masses of farmers in Luochuan and other three counties have established a total of 26 primary schools, and the number of students has increased by more than 2,000. Among them, children of poor and hired peasants account for 70 percent.

　　陕西黄龙专区今春完成土改
    农民生产热情空前提高
    一百多村庄互相挑战竞赛生产
    市镇逐渐繁荣新开办学校很多
    【新华社西安十七日电】陕西省黄龙专区农村在今春完成土地改革后，农民生产热情已大为提高。
    黄龙专区在关中平原以北的黄河西岸，辖黄龙山周围黄龙、黄陵、洛川、宜川、宜君等县，地瘠民贫，人烟稀少。该地区农民中很多是抗战初期由河南逃来的难民。他们开荒种地，受到当地封建地主极重的剥削。在解放以前，胡宗南匪军又曾以该地区作为封锁和进攻陕甘宁解放区的基地，十几年来对该区各县农民残暴抢掠。因此，当该区于一九四八年解放时，农民贫困达到极点。农民的生产情绪也低到极点。
    该区农村在解放以后，经过一九四八年冬季的减租和去冬今春的土地改革，现已面目一新。获得土地的农民，生产热情空前提高。农民纷纷组织起来，进行变工互助。据洛川、宜君、黄陵三县统计，今年夏收中组织起来的男女农民已达百分之六十以上。现在全专区至少有一百多个村庄，处在相互挑战的生产竞赛之中。洛川、黄陵、宜君等三县今年开荒达二万五千七百余亩，超过原订计划七千多亩。人民政府提倡的棉麻等作物的播种面积也超过了计划。全专区百分之六十的秋田，施肥比土地改革以前增加了大约一倍，而且都作到了深耕细作，耕锄三遍。耕畜共也增加四百多头。土地改革后的另两个现象是：市镇已经繁荣起来，新开办的学校很多。今年该专区农民添置和修理农具三万七千多件，因此，市镇上的手工业都恢复了。洛川等三县今年由农民群众自己开办的小学共二十六所，学生增加了两千多人。其中贫雇农子弟占百分之七十。
