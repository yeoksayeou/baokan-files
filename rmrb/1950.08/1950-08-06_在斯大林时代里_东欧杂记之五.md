　　In the Stalin Era
    ——Eastern European Miscellany, Part Five
    Feng Zhi
    April in Budapest is a beautiful spring city. Hungarians love bright colors, and at this time, especially women and children, wear dazzling clothes. On Margaret Island in the center of the Danube River is a green meadow, with neatly arranged bright red benches. We strolled on the island, looking south at the bridges over the river, talking about the war five years ago. Our host told us that in the winter of 1944, as the German fascists watched the reactionary Horthy government collapse under the victories of the Soviet army, they sent troops to occupy Hungary and seize Budapest. Budapest was surrounded by the Soviet army on December 24th. The Soviet army, unwilling to make the residents and buildings of Budapest victims of the war, sent two envoys on the 29th to inform the encircled fascist army not to engage in a desperate struggle, and to persuade them to hand over the city intact. But the fascist bandits, disregarding international law, murdered the envoys as soon as they entered their positions. Nevertheless, the Soviet army still followed Stalin's instructions not to harm the residents and buildings of Budapest, and did not use heavy artillery in the most intense fighting. However, on January 18, 1945, when the Soviet army liberated Pest, east of the Danube, the fascist bandits blew up the bridges over the river one by one. When they could no longer hold Buda, west of the river, in mid-February, they blew up their armories and carried out widespread destruction, turning most of the houses in Budapest into ruins. Budapest at that time was nothing like it is today. At that time, everyone was dejected, saying that the city could not be restored for thirty years. But now, in five years, Budapest has become a beautiful, colorful Budapest again! People have not only restored the old, but also built new things. Our host pointed to a bridge under construction on the Danube River to the north and said, "This is a new building, the Stalin Bridge. It is built entirely for the workers, because one end of the bridge is a factory, and the other end is a worker's residential area. Workers used to have to take a big detour to get from their homes to the factory, but when this bridge is completed, it will provide many conveniences for the workers and save a lot of time."
    In fact, not only Budapest, but the whole of Hungary, when it was liberated on April 4th, faced a scene of desolation: the fascist bandits destroyed factories, dragged away machines, burned villages, and slaughtered cattle and horses; moreover, there was not a single truck left in the country, and 80 percent of the railways were destroyed. The people endured hunger, and inflation broke all historical records. But the Soviet Union did not treat Hungary as a defeated country. It believed that it was Hitler's accomplice, the reactionary Horthy government, that declared war on the Soviet Union in 1941, not the Hungarian people. Therefore, as soon as it had removed the reactionary forces from Hungarian soil, it immediately extended a helping hand to the Hungarian people. When Hungary's transportation could not be restored immediately, the Soviet Union sent it 250 trucks on June 24th; when there were no cattle or horses in the countryside, the Soviet army sent many cattle and horses on September 24th; when there was a shortage of clothing, the Soviet Union shipped a large quantity of cotton on October 5th. This was only the first year after the war. Thereafter, we saw Hungary's reparations to the Soviet Union being reduced time and time again, while the Soviet Union's technical and material assistance to Hungary gradually increased, enabling Hungary, under the active leadership of the Workers' Party, to complete the Three-Year Plan promulgated on August 1, 1947, ahead of schedule, and to stipulate a new Five-Year Plan from this year onwards. We felt that the speed of Hungary's recovery and construction in these five years was almost miraculous, but the Hungarians always answered, "We thank Stalin!"
    "Not just politics and economics," one day in the Hungarian Writers' Association, the author of "Carpathian Rhapsody," Illyés Gyula, said to me, "In cultural aspects, we have even more to thank the Soviet Union. In the past, during the rule of the reactionary government, many writers and artists were exiled abroad or lived in prisons. Our greatest modern proletarian poet, József Attila, added a lot of rich content and expressive methods to our poetry, but due to poverty and persecution, he committed suicide in 1936 at the age of only thirty-four. Now we are all free and can create in a free world. Soviet literature has also been introduced in large quantities in these five years, educating our next generation of youth. From now on, no one will take Proust or Joyce as examples and seek a dead end in a blind alley."
    The Soviet Union liberated Hungary politically, economically, and culturally, and also returned to Hungary the flag of freedom that the Tsarist army had taken from the Hungarian people a hundred years ago. In 1849, the Hungarian people's anti-Austrian struggle was about to win, but the Russian Tsar sent troops to support the Austrian Emperor, dispersed the Hungarian people's army, and also seized many Hungarian flags as trophies. Now that the Hungarian people have won victory with the help of the Soviet Union, those flags have also returned to the hands of the people. During the grand parade, I saw these faded and wounded flags being held high and leading the way, radiating the great glory that had been submerged for a hundred years.
    In contrast to Budapest, in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, the bridges over the Vltava River and the ancient buildings on both sides were not destroyed, but people say that this is also thanks to Stalin. On May 5, 1945, the Soviet army had already captured Berlin a few days earlier, and the people of Prague armed themselves and fought fiercely with the Nazi army, occupying the radio station and several important transportation lines. But the Nazi army was still struggling to the death, preventing the Czech People's Army from advancing. The People's Army used the radio station to make an urgent appeal to Stalin, who immediately ordered the tank units of the Ukrainian front stationed in Berlin to rush to the aid of Czechoslovakia, liberating Prague on May 9th. People said, "The Soviet army came with lightning speed, and the Nazi army did not have time to destroy Prague before retreating." Following Prague, the entire Czechoslovakia was also liberated.
    Two years later, Czechoslovakia experienced a rare drought in its history, which would result in a loss of 15 billion crowns due to the poor harvest of agricultural products. Reactionaries took advantage of this opportunity to advance their political conspiracies. They tried every means to create hunger and chaos, inciting the people to express their dissatisfaction with the people's democratic government. They advised farmers not to sell grain to the government. Landlords and rural capitalists sent a quarter of their harvest to the black market. Their slogan at the time was: "The worse - the better." But the general farmers and middle peasants were not fooled by them. Under these circumstances, the government was still able to collect 66,000 carloads of grain. At this time, the Soviet Union transported 40,000 carloads of grain, saving the people of Czechoslovakia from starvation and helping the newly liberated Czechoslovakia overcome a political crisis.
    The Soviet Union has done its great help to the Czechs and to the Hungarians; even to the defeated Germany, its help has not diminished. As early as 1942, when the Nazi army was rampaging on Soviet territory, Stalin delivered that great speech on February 23, saying that the Red Army did not want to exterminate the German people or destroy the German state. Therefore, as soon as the Nazi regime came to an end in May 1945, the Soviets did not regard themselves as victors, but rather treated the German people as assistants. During the war, the fascist bandits plundered a lot of grain from Ukraine, Poland, and other places, and piled it up in warehouses in Berlin. On the eve of the collapse, they burned all these warehouses, so that after the Soviet army entered Berlin, the gunfire had not yet stopped, they had to transport a large amount of bread to relieve the citizens of Berlin. Some of the destroyed factories in East Germany have now been restored, but before they were restored, local officials were often asked by Soviet officers, "Why are these factories still empty? Are you unwilling to restore them?" If the Germans tiredly replied, "Where do we start?" The Soviet officers would say, "Where have the leaders of Germany gone? Please tell me, what do you need, we will help you. How much cement? How much glass? How much special supplies for the workers?..."
    I have not been to other Eastern European democratic countries, but I know that the happy lives and construction enthusiasm of their people are no different from those of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Moreover, how much hatred and disputes used to exist between these Eastern European countries in the past, and how harmonious they are now after liberation! They come and go, helping each other, like a big family, your success is my success, my victory is your victory. They jointly defend against Tito's spies, and jointly raise the children sent by the Greek democratic soldiers who persist in the mountainous areas....
    From here, we will feel more keenly the concrete meaning contained in the title "Leader and Teacher of the Working People of the World," and we will understand why the people of Eastern European democratic countries offer wreaths in front of the Soviet Army Martyrs' Memorial Monument on every holiday, and we will understand how much the gifts displayed in the Moscow Stalin Gift Exhibition represent the true feelings of the working people: they move their best products from factories, from the countryside, from art studios and present them to their leaders and teachers, because only in the Stalin era can they happily and bravely embark on the road of construction just after emerging from a war on the verge of death.

    The Soviet army brought not only freedom, but also love and bread to the children of Hungary.

　　在斯大林时代里
    ——东欧杂记之五
    冯至
    四月的布达佩斯是一座美丽的春城。匈牙利人爱好鲜明的色彩，这时，尤其是女人和小孩子，都穿上耀人眼目的衣裳。多瑙河中心马尔基特岛上是一片绿油油的草地，草地上整整齐齐摆列着鲜红的长椅。我们在岛上散步，向南望着河上的桥梁，谈起五年前的战争。我们的主人向我们说，一九四四年冬季，德国的法西斯看着霍尔梯的反动政府在苏军的胜利中就要崩溃，于是，派兵占领了匈牙利，盘据了布达佩斯。布达佩斯于十二月二十四日被苏军围住。苏军不忍使布达佩斯的居民和建筑成为战争的牺牲，二十九日派出两个使者，通知被包围的法西斯军队不要作困兽的斗争，劝他们把城完好地交出来。但法西斯匪徒们不顾国际公法，使者刚走入他们的阵地，便被他们戕杀了。虽然如此，苏军还遵守斯大林的指令，不要伤害布达佩斯的居民和建筑，在最剧烈的斗争中也没有使用重炮。可是在一九四五年一月十八日，苏军解放了多瑙河东的佩斯，法西斯匪徒们便把河上的桥梁一座一座地炸毁了。等到二月中旬，河西的布达他们也保持不住时，他们又炸毁了他们的军火库，进行普遍的破坏，使布达佩斯大部分的房屋都变成废墟。那时的布达佩斯哪里是今天的这个样子，那时人人都垂头丧气，说这座城非三十年不能恢复。但是现在呢，五年的功夫，布达佩斯又成为一个美丽的，色彩鲜明的布达佩斯了！人们不只恢复了旧的，而且建筑了新的。我们的主人用手指着北方多瑙河上游的一座正在兴建的桥说：“这就是一座新的建筑，斯大林桥。这完全是给工人建筑的，因为桥的一端是工厂，另一端是工人住区，从先工人到工厂，要绕一个很大的弯子，将来这座桥建筑成功，工人便会得到许多方便，节省许多时间。”
    事实上，不只布达佩斯，就是整个的匈牙利，在它四月四日全国解放时，人们的面前更是一片荒凉：法西斯匪徒们破坏了工厂，拖走了机器，烧毁了村庄，宰杀了牛马；而且全国没有剩下一辆载重汽车，铁路毁掉百分之八十。人民忍受着饥饿，通货膨胀打破一切历史的纪录。但是苏联并没有把匈牙利当作战败国。它认为一九四一年向苏联宣战的是希特勒的帮凶霍尔梯反动政府，并不是匈牙利的人民，所以它刚刚把反动势力从匈牙利的土地上铲除出去，就立即向匈牙利人民伸出来援助的手。匈牙利的交通不能立即恢复，苏联在六月二十四日送给它二百五十辆载重汽车；农村里没有牛马，苏军在九月二十四日送来许多牛马；缺乏衣服，十月五日苏联运来了大批的棉花。这不过是战后的第一年。此后我们便看见匈牙利对苏联的赔款一次一次地减低，苏联对匈牙利技术上与物质上的帮助却逐渐增加，致使匈牙利在工人党积极的领导下提前完成了一九四七年八月一日颁布的三年计划，并且从今年起又规定了新的五年计划。我们觉得匈牙利这五年内恢复与建设的迅速有些近于奇迹，但是匈牙利人总是这样回答，“我们感谢斯大林！”
    “不只是政治和经济，”一天在匈牙利著作家协会里，“喀尔巴阡山狂想曲”的作者伊利施·培拉向我说，“文化方面我们更要感谢苏联。在过去反动政府的统制时期，多少作家和艺术家都流亡外国，或是过着监狱生活，我们近代最伟大的无产阶级诗人约塞夫在我们的诗歌里添了许多丰富的内容与表现的方法，但是由于贫困与被迫害，在一九三六年自杀了，死时才三十四岁。如今我们都获得自由，可以在自由的天地中创作了。苏联的文学在这五年内也大量地介绍过来，教育着我们下一代的青年。此后再也不会有人把普鲁斯特，乔伊斯当作榜样在死胡同里寻求死路了。”
    苏联在政治、经济和文化上解放了匈牙利，并且给匈牙利送回来一百年前沙皇的军队从匈牙利人手中夺去的自由的旗帜。一八四九年匈牙利人民的反奥斗争已经快要胜利，但是俄国的沙皇派军队来支援奥皇，打散了匈牙利人民的军队，还抢走许多匈牙利人的旗帜当作战利品。如今匈牙利人民在苏联的帮助下获得胜利，那些旗帜也回到人民的手里。在盛大的游行时，我曾看见这些褪了色，受了伤的旗帜被人高高举起，向前引路，发扬出湮没了一百年的伟大的光辉。
    与布达佩斯相对照，在捷克斯洛伐克的首都布拉格，弗尔塔瓦河上的桥梁和两旁古代的建筑却都没有毁坏，但是人们谈起来，这也要感谢斯大林。一九四五年五月五日，苏军已经在几天前攻克柏林，布拉格的人民武装了自己和纳粹军队作激烈的战斗，他们占据了无线电台和几条重要的交通线。但是纳粹军队还要垂死挣扎，使捷克的人民军不能进展。人民军利用电台向斯大林作紧急的呼吁，斯大林立即命令驻在柏林的乌克兰线的坦克部队驰援捷克，于五月九日解放了布拉格。人们都说，“苏军来得神速，纳粹军队没有来得及破坏布拉格便撤退了。”随着布拉格，捷克斯洛伐克全国也得到解放。
    两年后，捷克斯洛伐克发生了历史上稀有的旱灾，由于农产品的歉收要损失一百五十亿克朗。反动分子便利用这个机会推进他们政治的阴谋。他们千方百计制造饥饿和混乱，煽动人民对于人民民主的政体表示不满。他们劝农民不要向政府售粮。地主和乡村资本家们把他们收获的四分之一都送入黑市。他们当时提出的口号是：“越坏——越好”。但一般的农民和中农并不受他们的蛊惑，政府在这情形下还能收集起六万六千辆车皮的粮食。这时，苏联却运来四万辆车皮的谷类，使捷克斯洛伐克的人民免于饥饿，并且帮助解放不久的捷克斯洛伐克在政治上度过了一个难关。
    对于捷克，对于匈牙利，苏联尽了它伟大的帮助；就是对于战败的德国，它的帮助也没有减少。远在一九四二年，当纳粹的军队在苏联的领土上横行时，斯大林在二月廿三日就发表那伟大的讲演，说红军并不要灭绝德国的人民与消灭德国的国家。所以在一九四五年五月纳粹政权一告终止，苏联人便不以胜利者自居，而是以辅助者的姿态来对待德国人民了。战争期内法西斯匪徒们从乌克兰、波兰各地掠夺来很多粮食，都堆集在柏林的仓库里，在崩溃的前夜，他们把这些仓库全部烧毁，致使苏军攻入柏林后，枪声还没有停止，便不得不运来大批的面包，救济柏林的市民。东德的一些被破坏的工厂如今都恢复了，可是在它们没有恢复时，当地的负责人常常被苏联的军官问：“这些工厂怎么还是空的呢？你们不愿意重新恢复它们吗？”如果德国人疲倦地回答，“从何做起呢？”苏联的军官便说，“德国的带头作用的人们都到哪里去了？请告诉我说，你们需要什么，我们帮助你们。多少水泥？多少玻璃？对于工人们用多少特殊的给养？……”
    我没有到过其他的东欧民主国家，但是我知道它们人民快乐的生活与建设的热情与匈牙利和捷克并没有两样。而且这些东欧的国家在过去国与国之间曾经存在过多少仇恨与纠纷，如今解放后他们彼此相处又是多么和乐！他们你来我往，互相帮助，像是一个大家庭一般，你的成功就是我的成功，我的胜利就是你的胜利。他们共同防御着铁托的间谍，共同抚养着坚持在山陵地带的希腊民主战士送来的子女……。
    我们从这里更会感到“全世界劳动人民的领袖与导师”这个称号中所含的具体的意义，更会明了东欧民主国家的人民为什么每逢节日便在苏军烈士纪念碑前献花圈，更会理解莫斯科斯大林礼品陈列馆里陈列着的礼品代表着多少劳动人民的真情：他们把他们最好的制作品从工厂里，从农村里，从艺术工作室里搬出来呈给他们的领袖与导师，因为只有在斯大林时代，他们才能刚从濒于死亡的战争里出来便快乐而勇敢地走上建设的道路。（附图片）
    苏军不只带来自由，也给匈牙利的儿童带来爱与面包。
