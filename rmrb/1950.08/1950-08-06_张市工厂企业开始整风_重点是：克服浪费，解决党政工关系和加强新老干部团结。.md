　　Zhang City Factories and Enterprises Begin Rectification Campaign
	Focusing on Overcoming Waste, Resolving Party-Government-Labor Relations, and Strengthening Unity Between Old and New Cadres.
	[Zhangjiakou News] According to the Chahar Daily, the Zhangjiakou City Factories and Enterprises Rectification Study Committee convened a meeting on July 22nd with 300 Party, government, and labor union cadres from 30 factories and enterprises to arrange for the commencement of the rectification study starting on July 25th. Li Rui, Deputy Secretary of the CCP Zhangjiakou City Committee Enterprise Party Committee, pointed out that the current focus of the factory and enterprise rectification campaign is threefold: First, to cherish state property, practice strict economy, overcome waste, and establish a long-term construction ideology. Because there are still serious waste phenomena in factories and enterprises, this is mainly manifested in: production without a plan, or a plan that is not accurate; no quota work done, or if done, not done well; and the security, responsibility, and inspection systems not being seriously established. Second, the phenomenon of paternalistic leadership, leading to the blurring of Party, government, and labor relations. Some factories and enterprises replace the government with the Party, and even replace the labor union with the Party, leaving the labor union to engage in mass movements; labor union cadres are not good at mobilizing the masses to run the labor union together. Third, the closed-doorism and self-proclaimed meritorious service mentality of old cadres and old Party members. They look down on technical personnel and new cadres. Some factories only pay attention to uniting activists, but neglect the unity and transformation of intermediate and backward elements.

　　张市工厂企业开始整风
    重点是：克服浪费，解决党政工关系和加强新老干部团结。
    【张家口讯】察哈尔日报消息：张家口市工厂、企业整风学习委员会，在七月二十二日召集了三十个工厂、企业单位党、政、工干部三百人开会，布置由七月二十五日开始的整风学习。中共张家口市委企业党委会副书记李锐指出当前工厂、企业整风的重点有三：第一是爱护国家财产，厉行节约，克服浪费，树立长期建设思想。因为目前工厂、企业还存在着严重的浪费现象，这主要表现在：生产没计划，或有计划也不精确；没有做定额工作，或作了也没有作好；保安、责任及检查制没有认真建立。第二是领导工作上的包办代替现象，致使党、政、工关系混淆。部分工厂、企业是以党代政，甚至以党代工，离开工会去搞群众运动；工会干部则不善于发动群众大家办工会。第三是老干部老党员的关门主义和以功臣自居的思想。他们看不起技术人员和新干部。有些厂只注意团结了积极分子，却忽视了对中间与落后分子的团结与改造。
