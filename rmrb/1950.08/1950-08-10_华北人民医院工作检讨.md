To the Editors of the People's Garden:

    After reading the criticisms of our work by Comrades Lou Shiyi, Zhang Yaqing, Ding Tuo, and Zhang Qicheng on July 5th and August 3rd, we recognize the serious shortcomings and errors in our work. Their criticisms also provided us with methods to improve our work. We humbly and sincerely accept these affectionate and correct criticisms and suggestions. In addition to deeply reflecting on ourselves, we have organized all hospital staff to conduct rigorous self-criticism to transform our work.

    Since taking over the hospital, we have shown weakness and ineffectiveness in transforming medical ideology and uniting medical personnel, causing undue suffering to sick and wounded cadres. The negative consequences stem from the following reasons:

    Firstly, the leadership has been irresponsible towards sick and wounded personnel, lacking concern for their pain and a revolutionary spirit of fraternity. The case of Comrade Meng Tie exemplifies this. Although we knew there were shortcomings in treatment and care, we did not bravely make self-criticisms to the patient's family. On the contrary, we used "regulations" as an excuse to withhold medical records and autopsy reports. This incident has been reviewed multiple times within the hospital, but the reviews were superficial due to a lack of deep ideological understanding. Consequently, we failed to use this specific event to educate and transform cadres, enabling all hospital staff to love patients and rescue those with urgent illnesses. Another example is Comrade Zheng Yongquan, who died after suffering a gunshot wound from a fire. He lost too much blood upon admission, and there was no timely blood transfusion or rescue. The blood vessel suturing surgery took too long, unfortunately leading to his death. In January, a Comrade Wang with acute appendicitis was admitted at 8:50 AM but was not operated on until 4:25 AM the next day, after it had already developed into localized peritonitis. The surgery then took two hours. Due to inadequate sterilization, pus formed, requiring two more operations and prolonging the recovery period.

    Secondly, technical skills are backward, and diagnoses are inaccurate, showing self-righteousness and stagnation, with obsolete technical standards. There indeed exists the lingering style of former Kuomintang military doctors, such as resistance to consultations and careless, ignorant diagnoses. These are historical issues. For example, when a patient with heart disease invited an outside physician for consultation, the internal medicine doctor expressed dissatisfaction and made sarcastic remarks. However, our leadership failed to seize these facts for rigorous education. Consequently, a serious error of subjectivism occurred in Comrade Wang Mingxiao's consultation. Although a conference was held during the April inspection to strictly criticize the inspection work, it was not thoroughly corrected.

    Thirdly, some medical personnel do not fulfill their duties before inspections and lack a spirit of service to patients. For example, Dr. Li Chongyan of the dermatology department pretended to be capable and wanted to show off, rashly performing four operations. After surgery on Comrades Zhang and Li for circumcision, the wounds did not heal, or there was bleeding, and the patients were transferred to another hospital. They barely recovered after a second operation. Two other comrades with varicocele and phimosis developed local induration after surgery and were not completely cured after three months in the hospital. Director Miller rudely discharged the patients. The mercenary attitude of some personnel, resulting in perfunctory work, still exists seriously. After the inspection, a patient waited for four hours at the outpatient clinic without being admitted to the ward.

    Fourthly, the system is unsound, and regulations are not strictly followed. For example, there are no specialized nurses for critically ill patients, the admitting doctor does not have fixed shifts, nurses are not enthusiastic enough towards patients, and hygiene is extremely poor. Some regulations are left to drift. For example: (1) To emphasize the concept of labor, nurses and workers are not distinguished in their work. Nurses spend their days engaging in egalitarian tasks like sweeping, fetching water, scrubbing floors, and carrying coal, with little or no time for nursing skills, while workers can administer injections and dispense medicine. (2) Nurses deliberately delay work, wandering around the ward all day, inefficient and lacking purpose. Preventive concepts are almost non-existent, knowledge of disinfection is poor, and there are many instances of wrong medications, incorrect injections, delayed medication, and dispensing medication without water. (3) There is significant food waste. The daily meal orders are handled routinely; patients are given the food regardless of whether they can eat it or not, and they keep what is left. Some have half a drawer full of biscuits, while others send them back or throw them away. The drain in the ward is clogged, resulting in three buckets of leftover rice and steamed buns being collected. There are nine master chefs in the kitchen, along with nine managers who are not united.

    In summary, there is serious bureaucratism in the leadership's ideology. Based on the criticisms and suggestions of the People's Garden, and past instances of negligence, responsible cadres will first conduct deep self-reflection and then organize all personnel to study these articles and review their mistakes, followed by a top-down and bottom-up inspection. We believe that in addition to relying on the assistance of higher authorities, the most important thing is for our leaders and cadres at all levels (medical and general affairs) to resolutely change their style, establish a hospital affairs committee with patient participation to implement democratic management, and foster a revolutionary tradition among all personnel to truly love patients and prioritize their needs. We will listen to patient opinions, clearly define rewards and punishments, strictly implement the inspection system, and overcome certain ideological obstacles and the irresponsible behavior of individual medical personnel. We will gradually implement the comrades' suggestions in our work and hope that you and the hospitalized patient comrades will continue to supervise, criticize, and help us so that the People's Hospital can truly bear the responsibility of treating cadres. We will not be dissatisfied with these correct criticisms. It is precisely because everyone cares about our work that we have increased our courage to improve.

North China People's Hospital

My Self-Criticism

    (1) I was ordered to inspect the North China People's Hospital. During the inspection process, I failed to fully understand the intentions of higher authorities and carefully study methods for improvement; nor was I able to grasp the key point of educating cadres through the facts of the inspection, so the effect after the inspection was not great. After the inspection, the higher authorities twice urged me to publish the inspection results in the Party newspaper, but I always wanted to study some transformation experiences and publish them together, so I kept delaying. This unorganized and undisciplined behavior is very serious. Seeing the criticisms and suggestions of the People's Garden, I understood more clearly the serious problems that existed in my thinking and organization.

    (2) I did not take the famous sayings "Cadres are the most valuable asset" and "Tolerance of irresponsible workers is cruelty to comrades" as my basic guidance for hospital management. Knowing that the irresponsible work attitude of the People's Hospital was not in line with revolutionary interests, I maintained a different kind of thinking lacking a mass perspective. I always wanted to try to raise the level of the original cadres and slowly transform them. I failed to reform vigorously and strictly continue supervision. Therefore, medical negligence or errors still occurred after the April inspection, indicating my irresponsibility to patients, insufficient attention to the tasks assigned by the leadership, and my inability to supervise and assist the North China People's Hospital.

    (3) I had promised Xinhua News Agency and Comrade Ding Tuo to publish the results of the inspection. I had said that I would invite the parents to participate in the review of the death of Comrade Lou Mengtie, and I had also planned to examine each of the opinions raised by various organizations about the North China People's Hospital one by one and answer them after obtaining the results. Some of these tasks were partially done, some were delayed, and some were not done at all. This is an irresponsible attitude towards the revolution. Comrade Lou Shiyi's criticism had a great educational significance for me, and I will transform my thinking and style to continue transforming the People's Hospital and overcome certain difficulties and obstacles to respond to it.

    In short, during the rectification of the Party and cadres, the publication of this criticism in the People's Garden has been of great help to the People's Hospital and me. I hope that medical workers and hospitals in all regions will take this as a lesson to transform hospital work.

### 华北人民医院工作检讨

专栏：

　　华北人民医院工作检讨编者同志：
    我们读了七月五日与八月三日楼适夷、张亚青、丁拓和张企程四位同志对我们的批评，指出了我们工作上的严重缺点和错误，也给了我们工作以改进的方法。这些批评与建议是亲切的、正确的，我们抱着虚心的态度，诚恳地接受。除了我们作深刻反省外，并组织全院人员进行严格的检讨，以达到改造我们工作的目的。
    我们的医院从接管到现在对于改造医疗思想团结医务人员表现了软弱无力，使伤病干部遭受到不应有的损失。其恶果是由于下列几方面原因造成的：
    首先是由于领导上对伤病员不负责任，不关心病员的痛苦，缺乏革命友爱精神。例如对孟铁同志的事件就是如此。虽然知道治疗上护理上有缺点，但是没有勇敢地向病员家属做自我检讨，相反的曾以“制度”为借口，不给病历，也没有抄写尸体病理诊断书等。这一件事，在医院也曾经多次检讨过，但由于在思想上认识不够深刻，因此检讨也只是肤浅的，也就不能以此具体事实去教育、改造干部，让全院人员都能热爱病员，抢救急病。又如对于郑永泉同志，因失火枪伤，流血过多入院，没有及时地输血抢救，血管缝合手术时间太长，不幸终至牺牲。一月间一位王同志患急性阑尾炎，八时五十分入院，竟拖延到十六小时二十五分才开刀，已呈局限性腹膜炎，手术就拖了二小时。因消毒不严密生脓，又作手术两次，所以治愈期延长。
    第二、技术落后，诊断不正确。表现了自以为是与固步自封，技术水准陈旧落后。也的确存在着国民党旧军医的残余作风，如对会诊的抵抗，诊断的草率无知。这些是有历史性的，例如有一位心脏病的病员，因为邀请院外医师会诊，内科大夫即表不满，说怪话，可是我们领导上，都没有抓紧这些事实进行严格的教育。因此，王明小同志的会诊，又发生了严重的主观主义的错误，在四月检查工作中，虽然召开了检查工作的大会与干部会进行严格批评，仍然没有获得彻底纠正。
    第三、有些医务人员在检查前不尽职责，没有为病员服务的思想。例如皮肤科李崇言大夫假装会，自己要露脸，冒然作了四次手术。张同志、李同志包皮截除术，手术后因不愈合或出血，病人转院，经第二次手术后才勉强治好。另两位同志精系静脉瘤及包皮过长，手术后局部硬结，住院三个月未彻底治愈，而米勒主任用粗暴的态度使病人出院。部分人员的雇佣观点敷衍塞责，还严重的存在着，在检查工作后曾发生一位病人在门诊时等了四个小时，没有收入病房。
    第四、制度不健全，也没有严格的遵守制度。例如重病无专门护士，接诊医生没有固定值班，护士对病员热情不够，而清洁卫生也极差，有些制度竟任其自流。例如：（１）为了强调劳动观念，使护士与工友工作不分。护士每天平均主义的扫地、打水、刷地板、抬煤，而不作或很少作护病技术工作，工友却可以打针发药。（２）护士工作尽量拖延时间，每天在病房中转来转去，疲塌没有工作效能。预防观点几乎没有，消毒常识亦差，至于发错了药，注射错了针，发药不及时，发药不给水，那就有很多的事实。（３）伙食的浪费很大。每日开饭单，照例办事，病人吃不了或不吃，也照例给，剩下的由病人自己保留着。有的人存了半抽屉饼干，有的送回去，丢掉了。病房水沟不通，结果掏出三桶病人吃剩的饭和馒头，厨房里九个大师傅，而管理人员也用了九个，而且相互不团结。
    总之，在领导思想上是存在着严重的官僚主义的。以上种种，今后我们根据人民园地对医院的批评和建议，根据过去许多失职事实，负责干部先做深刻的反省，并在全体人员中进行学习这些文章与对错误的检讨，然后再组织自上而下自下而上的检查。我们认为除了依靠上级的帮助外，最重要的还是我们领导人员和各级干部（医务和总务）痛下决心改变作风，组织上成立有病人参加的院务委员会实行民主管理，思想上达到全体人员真正热爱病人一切为着病人的革命传统作风，倾听病人意见，奖惩分明，严肃推行检查工作制度，克服某些思想障碍与个别医务人员不尽职责的作风。要把同志们的建议在工作中逐步实现，希望您们和住院的病员同志们继续给以督促批评和帮助。使人民医院真正能负担起干部治疗的责任。我们不因这些正确批评而有所不满。正因大家关心我们的工作，增加了我们改进工作的勇气。
                华北人民医院
    我的检讨
    （一）我奉令检查华北人民医院，在检查工作过程中，没能体会上级意图细心研究改进办法；也没有能掌握通过检查事实教育干部的重点，所以检查后的效果不大。检查后，上级曾两次催我把检查结果在党报上发表，我自己总想研究一些改造经验，一齐公布，所以拖了又拖。这种无组织无纪律的表现是很严重的。我见了人民园地的批评和建议，更明了自己在思想上，组织上存在着这些严重的毛病。
    （二）我没有把“干部是最宝贵的资本”与“对不负责任的工作者的容忍，就是对同志的残酷”的名言，作为自己对医院管理工作的基本指导。明知人民医院的不负责任的工作态度，是不合革命利益的，但存在着另一种没有群众观点的思想。总想尽量争取原有干部提高，慢慢改造，没能雷厉风行地改革，严格地继续督察。因此在四月检查后，仍然发生医疗过失或错误。说明了自己对病员不负责任，对领导上所分配的任务，不够重视；对华北人民医院的督导协助的无能。
    （三）我曾经应允过新华社和丁拓同志，把检查的结果公布，我曾说过对楼孟铁同志死亡检讨要请家长参加，我也曾计划过把各机关对华北人民医院所提的意见，逐一检查，待获得结果后逐一回答。这三个工作有的做了一部分，有的拖着在做，有的就未做。这是对革命不负责任的态度。楼适夷同志的批评对我有很大的教育意义，我将以改造我的思想与作风，继续改造人民医院。克服某些困难和障碍来回答。
    总之，在整党整干的期间，由于人民园地发表此一批评，对人民医院和我有了很大的帮助。我希望各地区的医务工作者和医院，都应以此为教训来进行改造医院工作。
