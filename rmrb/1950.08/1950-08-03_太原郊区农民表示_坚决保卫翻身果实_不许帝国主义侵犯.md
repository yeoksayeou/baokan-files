　　Taiyuan Suburban Farmers Express:
    Resolutely Defend the Fruits of Liberation, Forbid Imperialist Aggression
    [Our Dispatch] The propaganda team organized by the students of the Medical College of Shanxi University set off on July 27th to Jianziwan Village outside Taiyuan City and other places to carry out anti-American aggression propaganda among some households and in the fields. After listening to the propaganda, the farmers resolutely expressed their determination to defend the fruits of their liberation and not allow American imperialism and reactionaries to invade again. An old lady named Lu Changyuan said: I am from Henan. I have been in Shanxi for fourteen or fifteen years, working as a peddler with my husband and son. Before liberation, life was very difficult day and night. We had no house, not even a small plot of land. After our People's Liberation Army liberated Taiyuan, we were allocated fifteen acres of land and two cave dwellings to live in. The government loan also allowed us to buy a donkey. This year's wheat harvest yielded five or six bags, enough to eat for a year. My twenty-one-year-old son went to the mountains to chisel stones, and my husband goes to the fields from early morning. He has weeded the autumn seedlings two or three times. When he has time, he can also pick up two or three baskets of manure and has also taken on the job of administrative cadre in the village. I also go to the fields to help every day in addition to cooking and housework. This year there has been plenty of rain, and there is enough fertilizer, so the wheat seedlings are growing very well! If we have another good autumn harvest, the family won't be able to finish eating it in two years. There were never such good days during the Second War Zone (referring to the rule of Yan Xishan's bandit gang)! I have lived for fifty-one years, and I only turned over this year. If foreigners come to bully us, that won't do. Hao Xuezeng, who is fifty-two years old, said: Our village was not like this before. When the Japanese devils came, they bullied people. Then the Second War Zone came back, conscripting men and demolishing houses. The willows and jujube trees inside and outside the village were all cut down, and the tree roots were dug out to be used as firewood. Look, there is not even a tree in the village now. After liberation, we were allocated land, and we planted more than ten acres of crops and three acres of melons. He pointed to the melon field with a smile and said: If the Second War Zone was still here, would we dare to grow melons? They would have eaten them all long ago! It won't work for Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan to run away to Taiwan. The Korean people can fight the American reactionaries, and we will chop off their fingers too! It is a dream for the old Americans to occupy our Taiwan. We must produce well, produce more grain to hand over as public grain, and support our People's Liberation Army in attacking Taiwan.

　　太原郊区农民表示
    坚决保卫翻身果实  不许帝国主义侵犯
    【本报讯】山西大学医学院同学组织的宣传队于七月二十七日出发太原城外剪子湾村等地，到部分住户和田野中进行反对美国侵略的宣传。农民们在听了宣传后，坚决表示了保卫自己的翻身果实，不让美帝国主义和反动派再来侵略的决心。农民路长远老太太说：我是河南人，来山西十四、五年，与男人和儿子做小贩。解放以前一天到晚生活很困难，房无一间，地无一垅。咱们解放军，解放了太原后，分得了十五亩地，还有两个窑洞住，政府的贷款又买下个毛驴，今年的麦子打下五、六口袋，够一年吃得。二十一岁的儿子去山上凿石块，男人从早起就下地，秋苗锄了两、三遍，有时间还能拾两、三筐粪，并且担任了村上的行政干事；我每天除做饭做活外还要下地去帮忙。今年雨水又勤，肥料也足，麦苗长得可好哩！如果再有个好秋收，一家子两年也吃不清。二战区（按指阎锡山匪帮的统治）在那有这好日子呀！我活了五十一岁今年才翻了身，如果洋人来欺侮咱那可不行。五十二岁的郝学增说：以前咱们这个村可不是这个样，日本鬼子来了欺侮人，接着二战区回来，抓丁又拆房，村里村外的杨柳树枣林砍了个光，树根挖出当柴烧，你瞧村里现在连一棵树也没有。解放后分了田，种的十几亩庄稼，还有三亩瓜。他笑盈盈地指着瓜田说：如果他妈的二战区在咱们还敢种瓜？早被它们吃光啦！蒋介石阎锡山跑到台湾去也不行，朝鲜人民能打美国反动派，咱们也会剁它个指头！老美想占咱们的台湾是梦想，我们一定要好好生产，多打粮食交公粮，支援咱们的解放军打台湾。
