Editor's Note: Regarding the incident of Xing Xiaoxian, Director of the Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, refusing criticism from the Worker's Daily, this newspaper summarized the report on page this page on July 25th. The following is the investigation report of the People's Supervision Committee of the State Administration Council of the Central People's Government on the case, which has been approved by the State Administration Council. This report is of great educational significance to cadres in various regions, and the full text is hereby published.

(I) Course of the Incident

	On April 25th, the Worker's Daily published a letter from Yang Enqing, a worker correspondent from the Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory, reflecting many problems in the factory's leadership. After the letter was published, Director Xing Xiaoxian not only did not accept the criticism and correct the shortcomings, but was greatly dissatisfied. He even found reporter Wang Yuan of the Worker's Daily to talk at the factory, making sarcastic remarks without any principles. On May 17th, after several urging by the newspaper, the factory wrote a reply, explaining many of the problems reported by the correspondent, believing that they were not entirely in line with the actual situation. Director Xing's erroneous attitude towards criticism from the newspaper completely violated the principle of criticism and self-criticism. In order to promote the development of criticism and self-criticism, this committee, in cooperation with the Ministry of Railways, sent personnel to form a supervision team to investigate the factory on June 1st.

(II) Understanding of the Reported Situation

	After the supervision team went deep into the factory's employees to listen to their reflections and investigate on the spot, it proved that the situation reported by Yang Enqing was correct. Reporter Wang Yuan's report (Wang Yuan's report was published in the Worker's Daily on May 25th. – Editor) was also basically correct, with only a few inaccuracies in the report on individual issues. The first was writing the union organizing committee member in charge of the management committee election as "a clerk in the warehouse." Second, when mentioning quality issues in the report, it said: "The so-called quality only requires the square iron to be square, and not to be rhomboid. In fact, even if it is rhomboid, it can be used." Such a statement is inappropriate. After the supervision team pointed out the above two points, Comrade Wang Yuan humbly accepted them and admitted that he was also somewhat emotional after talking with Director Xing. Xing Xiaoxian's initial suspicion that the correspondent and reporter's motives for criticism were impure and his attitude towards them were very naive and wrong.

(III) Problems Existing in the Factory's Leadership

	1. The ideology of relying on the working class to run the factory well is not clear.

	The lack of a clear understanding of relying on the working class to run the factory well is first manifested in the leadership of the management committee. The management committee was hastily conceived and established. The factory's leadership and the members of the management committee themselves have an unclear understanding of the nature and role of the management committee. After the management committee was established, it only held one meeting, and then it was merged with the factory affairs meeting, which performed daily administrative tasks, which was actually equivalent to canceling the management committee. The management committee dared not boldly let the members convey the resolutions to the workers, fearing that the worker members would convey them incorrectly, and attempted to replace them with simple administrative announcements. Before the management committee meeting, it did not widely solicit opinions from the masses. Even if individual workers raised issues, they were not publicly conveyed to the workers after discussion, but only "explained to the original proposer." Therefore, many workers reflected: "The management committee does not play a role at all," "only represents the opinions of a few people," "never tells us, and does not know what they are doing."

	Secondly, in dealing with trade union work, it also showed a lack of clear understanding of relying on the working class. The trade union cadres elected from the workers are active and enthusiastic in their work. General Xing believed that their level was low, their ability was weak, and they could not do anything well. He only reprimanded and blamed them, and did not patiently help them. When mobilizing to give up the year-end double salary, the workers were dissatisfied with the trade union. Xing did not try to reverse this situation and support the prestige of the trade union, but publicly reprimanded the director of the trade union, which hit the mood of the trade union members. Xing did not respect the independence of the trade union organization and did not realize that the trade union is a mass organization of the working class. Xing also interfered with the trade union's purchase of drums and bugles with cultural and educational funds. Therefore, cadres were afraid of taking responsibility, and trade unions dared not make decisions in case of trouble, and had to ask the factory director for a decision, which was actually equivalent to canceling the trade union organization.

	For example, the unity of old technical personnel also reflects this kind of thinking. For example, the workers of a factory were dissatisfied with the factory director Wan Shufang and the engineer Yi Jiming, and suggested that they were not responsible and did not pay attention to the workers' rational suggestions. Xing Xiaoxian did not conduct appropriate education on Wan and Yi to urge them to correct their mistakes, but instead mobilized the workers not to mention their opinions, fearing that it would affect their work mood.

	2. Serious bureaucracy and patriarchal style.

	After Xing Xiaoxian arrived at the factory last December, although subjectively he wanted to run the factory well, he only spent all day in the office arranging work and listening to reports. He rarely went deep into the site and did not understand the production situation and the workers' thoughts and emotions. He did not even attend the mobilization meeting for production. At the general staff meeting in March this year, the workers made criticisms to Xing, but Xing replied: "I want to rely on the organization to promote the work. I only know the directors of each section in the factory, and I only know the factory director in the first and second factories. If you want me to approach you, who should I look for?" The handling of problems is also very subjective and hasty. For example, in order to distinguish the active, intermediate, and backward elements among the employees, instead of understanding from the production movement, he asked the trade union members to make non-public appraisals for each worker. Not only was the task not completed, but because some workers heard that they were said to be backward in the appraisal, they were very dissatisfied with the trade union. In April, in order to complete the production task of sleepers, instead of mobilizing the enthusiasm of the employees and improving technology, he took the method of asking the workers to process for two hours every day, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers. The issue of model evaluation on May 1st was unprepared and unarranged in advance. The temporary evaluation failed to encourage the enthusiasm of the employees in production.

	The leadership always delays and fails to solve the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers, as well as issues related to production, sanitation, and welfare. For example, the smothering furnace in the West Workshop is an open-air device. Rain and wind affect work. Worker Zhao Chengqi suggested to the factory director and deputy factory director to build a board room at the end of last year, and proposed it again in April this year, but it has not been resolved so far; there is no oil box under the gear box of the iron pulling machine in the iron pulling department, and the oil flows into the ditch, which is a great waste. Worker Wang Xixian suggested to the factory director twice to cast an oil box or repair an oil tank, but it was not adopted. In January this year, worker Qi Jian also proposed to make several oil boxes out of iron sheets, and only three were placed in places with more oil spills, but the machine oil in other places still flowed into the ditch; the original horsepower electric roll used by the iron pulling department often heats up and has to stop to cool down, which affects the work greatly. A small 200-horsepower electric roll was purchased from Beijing last June, but it was not installed until May this year; the boiler for boiling water in the first factory is too small. It is not enough to supply drinking water for all the workers in the factory, and it was proposed to the administration half a year ago, but it has not been resolved so far. Therefore, the workers reflected, "It is useless to make suggestions anyway, it can't be solved."

	Xing Xiaoxian's patriarchal leadership style is also very serious. Trade union members and management committee members are afraid of him and dare not raise any opinions. He severely reprimands trade union cadres for any shortcomings and mistakes. For example, when giving up double pay, trade union director Li Shiyuan was not in the factory, and trade union member Ding Minggang did not do a good job. Xing not only lost his temper with Ding, but also kept chasing Li, which made Li cry. Xing stomped his feet and said, "Why are you so fragile? I can't stand crying. If you cry again, I have even more powerful methods." Such criticism actually hits the mood of the cadres. Therefore, trade union cadres all said: "I am afraid that the work will not please both ends, and I am unwilling to do it."

(IV) Xing Xiaoxian's Transformation

	When the supervision team first went to Xing Xiaoxian, he repeatedly emphasized: The accessories factory is a mess left by the enemy and puppet regime, and shortcomings are inevitable; when the former military representative Zhang Peng was there, the work was very chaotic; subjectively, he wanted to do a good job, and he also made an effort to rectify the organization, but before it was rectified, the reporter came to criticize, and did not point out a direction for the factory. In general, Xing was still unwilling to accept the criticism from the newspaper at that time, and suspected that the reporter's reporting motives were bad. In the conversation, he particularly emphasized that his "relying on the organization and being responsible at each level" work method was completely correct. Based on this situation, the supervision team decided to go deep into the site first, understand the situation, and then solve the problem from the ideological leadership. After two days of investigation, it was proved that the situation in the factory was indeed serious. On the third day, he began to talk to Xing, first pointing out: Yang Enqing's report was correct, and the reporter's investigation report was basically correct. The motives and spirit of the criticism are good and have a positive effect on the improvement of the factory's work; the direction of the work should be obtained from the review, and it is wrong to refuse to accept the criticism on the pretext that the reporter only made criticisms and did not point out the direction and could not come up with a solution; when reviewing the shortcomings and mistakes in the work, we should focus on the subjective aspects and should not emphasize objective reasons. If the work of the management committee and the trade union is not done well, we should first review it from the leadership. And he emphasized: "The problems mentioned in the report are only a part, and the main problem lies in the ideological leadership and work style." And he listed some examples to illustrate the shortcomings and mistakes in his past handling of those problems, and how he should do it to achieve good results. He adopted the method of analyzing and criticizing specific problems to help him recognize his mistakes. In the two talks, Xing vaguely admitted some shortcomings, such as his impatience, bad attitude towards trade union cadres, too much criticism, and too little persuasion and education. The way to deal with the management committee is not to let go boldly, but to be small-handed and small-footed. But he still emphasized that the objective situation and the subjective motives were to do a good job. He still did not realize the problems existing in the ideological leadership and work style. Xing once said: "I can't do the work, my health is not good, and I ask the higher authorities to transfer me." And he proposed: "Everyone disagrees with my opinion, then I will admit my mistake. Whatever punishment the higher authorities give me is fine." He began to take a liberal and passive attitude towards his mistakes.

	After studying this kind of thinking, he continued to talk to Xing, on the one hand pointing out that he must be humble and calm in dealing with problems, and he could boldly put forward different opinions, but he should face the truth and face reality. The main purpose of checking the work is to absorb experience and educate cadres, and should not first consider the issue of punishment; on the other hand, it affirms that his work motives are good, and he has also done some work. However, the subjective motive to do a good job does not mean that the work is done well. Checking the work is not checking the motives, nor is it checking what has been done, but mainly checking how well it is done? For example, the "relying on the organization and being responsible at each level" work method is correct in principle. However, the trade union has collapsed, the management committee does not play a role, cadres at all levels dare not take responsibility or are not responsible, and the leadership does not go deep into the site to understand the situation, only listens to reports, and does not check afterwards. In this case, the so-called "relying on the organization and being responsible at each level" work method is actually empty talk. In addition, he was shown the specific investigation materials and introduced him to read some relevant documents. During this period, Xing Xiaoxian's ideological struggle was fierce, and his emotions were also very painful (it is understood that he often took cardiac stimulants and sleeping pills at that time). After five talks, Xing Xiaoxian began to admit that his ideology of relying on the working class was not clear and that he had a patriarchal style. At this time, Xing had taken the initiative to talk to the supervision team, striving to correct his mistakes and asking to make a public review to all the factory employees. On the 7th and 8th, Xing wrote a reflection outline all day long, staying up all night. When he couldn't figure out some problems, he asked the supervision team to help him analyze. After the outline was written, Xing asked for a preliminary talk, first of all, he admitted that "after arriving at the factory, he subjectively believed that the trade union cadres were useless and wanted to re-elect them. Therefore, on the one hand, he was harsh and even hit the trade union cadres, and on the other hand, he restricted the activities of the trade union cadres. He denied and obliterated the achievements of the trade union work, and only saw its shortcomings. The establishment of the management committee was not only hasty, but also because the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways had an instruction in February to establish a management committee in the near future. In order to complete the task, it was hurriedly established, not for the purpose of implementing democratic management and feeling the need for work. Therefore, before the election, it was believed that truly capable committee members could not be elected." Secondly, he realized that he did have serious bureaucracy and a patriarchal style, and said many specific facts. For example, the trade union bought drums and bugles with trade union cultural and educational funds according to the workers' request without telling him, so he blamed Li Shiyuan for being dictatorial and scolded Li for not having a mass viewpoint. The Tianjin Trade Union notified the preparation of the "May 1st" parade's entertainment program. When he was in Beijing, Li Shiyuan notified the trade unions of the first and second factories to organize workers to practice Yangko in their spare time. After he returned to the factory, without clarifying the details, he called Li Shiyuan sarcastically and said: "Director of the trade union, I ask you for instructions, who told you to do the May Day parade? How come I don't know? Can you just take more than 500 people from the factory out casually? You have to be responsible!" Li was about to explain, but he hung up the phone. Regarding the "relying on the organization and being responsible at each level" work method, he also admitted that "he only emphasized it one-sidedly and mistakenly opposed it to going deep into the site, understanding the situation. For the past six months, I often felt that the work could not be promoted, but I did not realize that I should take the mass line well and give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses in production; on the contrary, I was conservative and left the masses and production to rectify the organization, and as a result, no organization was relied on." Regarding the reporting issue, he admitted that "the initial attitude towards the correspondent and the reporter was wrong, only arguing about trivial issues, and not considering the basic spirit of criticism." In the conversation, he expressed his complete acceptance of the criticism in the newspaper, agreed with the editor's note of the Worker's Daily (when the Worker's Daily published reporter Wang Yuan's report on May 25th, the editor added an editor's note, pointing out that Director Xing's attitude towards newspaper criticism was wrong. – Editor), and thanked the correspondent, the reporter and the supervision team for their help. He said: "Without the criticism from the correspondent and the reporter and the patient help of the supervision team, the work of the accessories factory would not change, and the personal mistakes could not be corrected. If it continues to develop, it will be very dangerous for the factory and for the individual." At this time, Xing Xiaoxian had changed his negative mood and revealed an active and happy mood, and he also had confidence in the work of the accessories factory. This is indeed not easy for Comrade Xing Xiaoxian, who is very subjective and quite self-righteous. Therefore, the supervision team encouraged him on the one hand and pointed out that this was only the beginning, and the important thing was how to implement the spirit of the review into the work. On the afternoon of the 10th, Xing Xiaoxian finally made a public review at the general staff meeting, admitting his mistakes and expressing that "in the future, he will definitely put down the bureaucratic airs, go deep into the site, and closely connect with the staff and comrades to jointly do a good job in the work of the accessories factory."

(V) Handling Opinions

	Xing Xiaoxian's resistance to the criticism from the Worker's Daily is wrong. This mistake is inseparable from his bureaucratic leadership, distrust of the masses, self-righteousness, unwillingness to learn, and old-fashioned style. However, after this exposure and criticism, Xing has realized his mistakes ideologically, made a relatively profound self-criticism at the general staff meeting, and expressed his determination to correct his mistakes and do a good job; at the same time, Xing Xiaoxian subjectively wanted to run the factory well and also made some achievements. The existence of many problems in the accessories factory is due to the wrong leadership methods on the one hand, and the poor conditions of the factory, the lack of factory work experience, and the lack of help from the higher-level leaders on the other hand. For this reason, this committee decided to exempt Xing Xiaoxian from punishment.

(VI) Several Suggestions

	The following are a few suggestions for the factory's work in the near future:

	1. The Party, government, trade union, and youth league should unify their steps, concentrate their efforts, face production, and launch a new production movement. Pay attention to saving and preventing waste.

	2. Improve the organization of the management committee and the trade union, and earnestly do a good job in the work of the management committee and the trade union. Clarify the relationship between the administration and various organizations. Realize the policy of democratization of factory management.

	3. The rationalization proposals put forward by the workers, especially the opinions on production and labor protection issues, should be carefully studied and discussed. All the correct ones that can be done should be resolved immediately, and those that cannot be resolved temporarily must be explained clearly to the workers. We must resolutely eradicate the irresponsible attitude of procrastination.

	4. During this investigation, the factory's leadership reflected that the relevant departments of the Ministry of Railways, such as the Materials Bureau and the directly affiliated trade union, did not provide enough help to them, "asking for more and giving less." I hope you will pay attention to this in the future.

　　关于铁道部材料局天津钢铁配件厂
    厂长邢笑先不接受报纸批评事件的调查、处理报告
    中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会
    编者按：关于铁道部材料局天津钢铁配件厂厂长邢笑先不接受工人日报批评的事件，七月二十五日本报本版曾摘要报道。下面是中央人民政府政务院人民监察委员会关于该案的调查报告，业经政务院批示同意。这一报告对于各地干部有重大教育意义，特将全文发表。
    （一）事件经过
    四月二十五日，工人日报登载了一封天津钢铁配件厂工人通讯员杨恩庆的来信，反映该厂领导上存在很多问题。该信登出后，厂长邢笑先不但未接受批评，纠正缺点，反大为不满，竟找工人日报记者王源至该厂谈话，冷嘲热讽，毫无原则。五月十七日，该厂在报社几次催促下写了一封回信，对通讯员报道的问题，多所解释，认为与实际情况不尽相符。邢厂长这种对待报社批评的错误态度，是完全违反批评与自我批评的原则。为了推动批评与自我批评的开展，本委协同铁道部派员组成监察组，于六月一日赴该厂调查。
    （二）报道情况的了解
    监察组深入该厂职工中听取反映并在现场调查后，证明杨恩庆报道的情况是正确的。记者王源的报道（王源的报道刊载于五月二十五日工人日报。——编者）基本上也正确，仅有个别问题的报道失实。第一是把主持管委会选举的工会组织委员写成“仓库的一个职员”。第二是报道中提到质量问题时说：“所谓质量只是要求方铁要方，不成菱形便成了。其实就是菱形也一样用。”这样的说法是不合适的。上述两点经监察组指出后，王源同志即虚心接受，并承认自己与邢厂长谈话后，也有些感情用事。邢笑先最初怀疑通讯员及记者批评动机不纯及其对待的态度均是十分幼稚与错误的。
    （三）该厂领导上存在的问题
    １、依靠工人阶级办好工厂的思想不明确。
    依靠工人阶级办好工厂的思想不明确，首先表现在对管委会的领导上。管委会从酝酿到成立都很草率。厂的领导上及管委会委员本身对管委会的性质和作用都认识不清。管委会成立后，只开过一次会，以后就与执行日常行政任务的厂务会议合并召开，实际上等于取消管委会。管委会的决议不敢大胆的让委员到工人中去传达，怕工人委员传错，而企图以简单的行政布告来代替。管委会在开会前，未普遍征求群众意见，即有个别工人提出问题，讨论后也不公开向工人传达，只是“向原提议人作解释”。因此，许多工人反映：“管委会根本不起作用”，“只代表少数人意见”，“从来也不给我们说说，不晓得他们在搞些什么”。
    其次在对待工会工作上，也同样表现了依靠工人阶级思想不明确。从工人中选举出来的工会干部，工作积极热情。邢总认为他们水平低，能力弱，办不了事，一味训斥责备，不去耐心帮助。动员放弃年终双薪时，工人对工会不满。邢没有设法扭转这一情况，扶持工会威信，却对工会主任当众训斥，打击了工会委员的情绪。邢对工会组织上的独立性尊重不够，没有认识到工会是工人阶级群众性的组织。工会用文教费买鼓、号，邢亦干涉。因此，干部怕负责任，工会遇事不敢作主，要请示厂长决定，实际上等于取消了工会的组织。
    再如对旧技术人员的团结，也反映了这种思想，如一厂工人对该厂主任万树芳、工务员仪吉明不满，提出他们不负责任，不重视工人的合理建议。邢笑先不对万、仪进行适当的教育，促其改正，反而动员工人不要提他们的意见，怕影响他们的工作情绪。
    ２、严重的官僚主义及家长制的作风。
    邢笑先去年十二月到厂后，虽主观上是想把工厂搞好，但只是终日在办公室里布置工作，听取汇报，很少深入现场，对生产情况及工人的思想情绪不了解，连布置生产的动员大会也不去参加。今年三月全体员工大会上，工人向邢提出批评意见，邢却回答说：“我要依靠组织推动工作，我在厂内只认得各股主任，在一、二厂只认得厂主任，要我接近你们，叫我找谁？”处理问题亦十分主观和草率。例如为了想区别职工中的积极、中间、落后分子，不是从生产运动中去了解，而是让工会委员给每个工人做不公开的鉴定。不但任务未完成，且因某些工人听到鉴定里说他落后，对工会大为不满。四月份为完成垫板生产任务，不是发动职工的积极性和改良技术，而采取每日叫工人加工两小时的办法，引起工人不满。“五一”评模问题，事前无准备，无布置，临时匆忙评议，未能做到鼓励职工生产情绪的积极作用。
    工人提出合理化的建议，以及有关生产、卫生、福利的问题，领导上总是拖延不予解决。例如：西厂房焖火炉是露天装置。下雨刮风，都影响工作。工人赵承淇去年底就向厂主任及副厂长建议修建板房，今年四月再次提出，至今未能解决；拔铁部拔铁机齿轮箱下没有油盒，油都流到地沟里，浪费很大，工人王希贤两次向厂主任建议铸一油盒或修一油槽，均未被采纳。今年一月工人齐建又提议用铁皮做几个油盒子，才做了三个放在流油较多的地方，但其他地方的机油仍流入地沟；拔铁部原来使用之马力电滚，经常发热要停车待凉影响工作很大。去年六月自北京买来了一个小型二○○马力电滚，一直拖到今年五月才按装上；一厂烧水锅炉太小。不够供给全厂工人饮水，半年前就向行政上提出，但至今尚未解决。因此，工人反映，“提意见也是白提，反正解决不了。”
    邢笑先家长制的领导作风，亦是很严重的。工会委员、管理会委员都怕他，有意见也不敢提。对工会干部是一有缺点与错误，就严予训斥。如放弃双薪时。工会主任李士元未在厂，工会委员丁明刚没搞好工作，邢不仅对丁大发脾气，且一在追逼李，急得李哭了起来。邢跺脚说：“你怎么这样脆弱，我见不得哭，再哭我还有更厉害的办法。”这样的批评，事实上是打击了干部的情绪。因此，工会干部都表示：“怕工作两头不讨好，不愿意干”。
    （四）邢笑先的转变
    邢笑先在监察组初去时，一再强调：配件厂是敌伪留下的烂摊子，缺点是不可免的；前任军事代表张鹏在时，工作就搞得很乱；主观上是想搞好工作，亦努了一把力，整顿了组织，但尚未整理好，记者就来批评，亦没有给工厂指出个方向。总的说来，当时邢对报社的批评仍然不肯接受，并怀疑记者的报道动机不良。谈话中特别强调其“依靠组织，逐级负责”的工作方法是完全正确的。根据这种情况，监察组就决定先深入现场，了解情况，然后再从领导思想上来解决问题。经过两天调查，证明该厂情况确实严重。第三天即开始找邢谈话，首先指出：杨恩庆的报道是正确的，记者的调查报道基本上也是正确的。批评的动机和精神都是好的，对工厂工作改进有积极作用；工作方向要从检讨中获得，借口记者只是作了批评，没有指出方向，拿不出办法而不肯接受批评是错误的；检讨工作中的缺点和错误时应该着重主观方面，不应强调客观原因，如管委会、工会工作没有搞好，就应先从领导上去检讨。并着重指出：“报道中所提的问题仅是一部分，主要的问题还在于领导思想与工作作风上”。并列举了一些例子，说明其过去处理那些问题有缺点，有错误，应该怎样做才能收到好的效果。采用了分析，批判具体问题的方式，帮助他认识错误。两次谈话中，邢笼统的承认了一些缺点，例如自己脾气急躁，对待工会干部态度不好，批评多，说服教育少。对管委会的作法不是大胆放手，而是小手小脚等。但仍强调客观情况和主观动机是想搞好工作的。对于领导思想与作风方面所存在的问题，当时仍未认识到。邢曾表示：“工作干不了，身体不好，要求上级调动”。并提出：“大家都不同意我的看法，那我就承认错误。上级怎样处分都可以。”对于自己的错误开始采取了自由主义的消极态度。
    研究了这种思想，遂继续找邢谈话，一方面指出对待问题必须虚心冷静，不同意见可大胆提出，但应该面向真理，正视现实。检查工作，主要是吸取经验，教育干部，而不应首先考虑处分问题；另方面肯定其工作动机是好的，也做了若干工作。但主观动机想搞好工作，并不等于工作就作好了。检查工作并不是检查动机，也不是检查作了什么，而主要是检查作得怎么样？例如“依靠组织，逐级负责”的工作方法，原则上是对的。但工会垮了，管委会不起作用，各级干部不敢负责或不负责任，而领导上又不深入现场了解情况，只听取汇报，事后亦不检查。在这种情况下，所谓“依靠组织，逐级负责”的工作方法，实际上成了一句空话。另外，又把调查的具体材料给他看，并介绍他阅读一些有关文件。这一期间，邢笑先的思想斗争是剧烈的，情绪上亦十分苦痛（据了解当时他常打强心剂、吃安眠药）。经过了五次谈话后，邢笑先才开始承认自己依靠工人阶级思想不明确，有家长制作风。此时，邢已主动找监察组谈话，力求改正错误，要求向全厂职工公开检讨。七、八两日，邢整天写反省提纲，通宵不眠。有些问题想不通时，就要监察组帮助他分析。提纲写好后，邢又要求预谈一次，首先，他承认“到厂后主观上就认为工会干部不中用，想把他们改选掉。因此，一方面苛责甚至打击工会干部，一方面限制工会干部的活动。否定、抹煞工会工作的成绩，只看见它的缺点。成立管委会，不仅是草率而且是由于铁道部材料局二月份有个指示，要在最近时期内建立管委会，为了完成任务才匆忙建立起来，并不是为了实行民主管理和感到工作上需要。因此，选举前就认为选不出真正能办好事情的委员来”。其次，他认识到自己的确存在着严重的官僚主义及家长制的作风，并说了许多具体事实。如工会根据工人要求用工会文教费买了鼓号，未告诉他，他就责备李士元独裁，斥李没有群众观点。天津地区工会通知准备“五一”游行的文娱节目，他在北京，李士元即通知一、二两厂工会组织工人在业余时间练习秧歌。他回厂后，不问清底细，就打电话讽刺李士元说：“工会主任，我向你请示，五一游行是谁叫你搞的？我怎么不知道？你随便把厂里五百多人带出去，行吗？你要负责！”李正要解释，他却把电话挂上了。关于“依靠组织，逐级负责”的工作方法，他也承认“只是片面强调，并错误地把它和深入现场，了解情况，对立起来看。半年以来经常感到工作推不动，却没有认识到应该很好的走群众路线，在生产中发挥群众的积极性与创造性；相反地是抱残守缺，离开了群众，离开了生产来整顿组织，结果一个组织也没依靠上”。报道问题。他承认“当初对待通讯员及记者的态度是错误的，只从枝节问题上去争执，不从批评的基本精神上考虑”。谈话中，表示完全接受报纸上的批评，同意工人日报编者的按语（工人日报于五月二十五日刊出该报记者王源的报道时，编者加上按语，指出邢厂长对待报纸批评的态度是错误的。——编者），并感谢通讯员、记者及监察组的帮助。他说：“如果没有通讯员及记者的批评和监察组的耐心帮助，配件厂的工作不会改变，个人的错误亦不可能改正。发展下去，对工厂、对个人都是十分危险的。”此时邢笑先已经改变了消极的情绪，流露出积极愉快的心情，对配件厂的工作亦有了信心。这对于主观性很强而又相当自以为是的邢笑先同志来说确是不容易。因此监察组一面给以鼓励，一面指出这仅是开始，重要的是如何把检讨的精神贯彻到工作中去。十日下午，邢笑先终于在全厂职工大会上公开检讨，承认错误，并表示“今后一定放下官僚架子，深入现场，和职工同志紧密的联系起来，共同把配件厂的工作搞好。”
    （五）处理意见
    邢笑先抗拒工人日报的批评是错误的。这种错误是与其在领导上的官僚主义，不相信群众，自以为是，不爱学习，老一套作风分不开的。但经过此次揭发批判，邢已从思想上认识了自己的错误，在全厂职工大会上作了比较深刻的自我检讨，并表示决心改正错误，搞好工作；同时，邢笑先主观上确是想把工厂办好，也作出了一些成绩。配件厂存在很多问题，一方面是由于领导方法不对头，另一方面工厂条件差，缺乏工厂工作经验，以及上级领导帮助少，亦是事实。为此，本委决定对邢笑先免予处分。
    （六）几点建议
    对该厂在最近期内的工作，有如下几点建议：
    １、党、政、工、团统一步调，集中力量，面向生产，展开新的生产运动。注意节约，防止浪费。
    ２、健全管委会、工会的组织，认真搞好管委会、工会工作。明确行政和各种组织的相互关系。实现工厂管理民主化的方针。
    ３、工人所提出的若干合理化建议，特别是关于生产与劳保问题的意见，应认真研究讨论。凡是正确的并能够办到的，应立即解决，暂时不能解决的，必须向工人解释清楚，要切实铲除拖延不理的不负责任态度。
    ４、此次调查中该厂领导上反映铁道部有关部门如材料局及直属工会等对他们的帮助是很不够的，“要求多，给得少。”希望今后注意。
