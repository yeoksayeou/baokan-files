Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 1st. After a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army entered Wuqia, a border area in western Xinjiang, in early March this year, it immediately began actively carrying out various production activities. Wuqia is located on the Pamir Plateau, with a severely cold climate. Even in June, the mountains are still covered with snow. Under various difficult conditions, the officers and soldiers of the unit planted more than 500 mu of cold-resistant crops such as highland barley, mined "zeke" (a type of dye), extracted rock salt, and carried out other production and construction. During production, the soldiers sometimes spent the night in uninhabited barren mountains, and sometimes could not get oil or salt, making life extremely hard, but their work morale was very high.

　　新疆西部乌恰驻军战胜严寒积极生产
    【新华社迪化一日电】新疆人民解放军某部于本年三月初进驻新疆西部边境的乌恰后，立即积极进行各项生产。乌恰地处帕米尔高原，气候严寒，六月的天气，山上仍积雪皑皑。该部指战员在各种困难条件下，种植青稞等耐寒作物五百余亩，并挖掘“则克”（一种染料），开采岩盐及进行其他生产建设。生产中，战士们有时夜宿荒无人烟的荒山中，有时吃不上油、盐，生活极为艰苦，但他们的劳动情绪很高。
