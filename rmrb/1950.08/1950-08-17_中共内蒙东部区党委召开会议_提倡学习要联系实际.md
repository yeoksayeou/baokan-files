The CCP Inner Mongolia Eastern District Committee Convenes Meeting
    Advocates Learning Should Be Combined with Reality
    [This newspaper dispatch] The CCP Inner Mongolia Eastern District Committee convened a study meeting of party member cadres from directly affiliated organizations on August 3rd to discuss rectification and study issues. At the meeting, Gao Jinming, Minister of the Organization Department, reported on the learning situation in directly affiliated units over the past half-month and pointed out the attitudes and methods for future learning. He said: Although some units have adopted the method of combining document study with work inspection, some units have still taken detours and exhibited deviations. One deviation is looking for too many reference books, relaxing the study of formal documents, or simply studying documents and rigidly adhering to the wording without linking it to actual work, resulting in emptiness and nothing gained. Another deviation is unwillingness to study documents, lacking interest in them. They say, "Anyway, we'll be rectified sooner or later, why bother going around in circles!" Consequently, they overemphasize linking to reality and solving problems, believing that studying documents is a waste of time. Regarding this issue, Minister Gao pointed out: According to the spirit of the North China Bureau's instructions, rectification must have clear goals and steady steps. First, focus on reading documents for a certain period of time, link it to work, and conduct preliminary inspection and summarization to deeply understand the spirit and essence of the documents. Then, launch criticism and self-criticism to comprehensively inspect and summarize work. However, this does not mean rigidly dividing rectification and study into two unconnected stages. The study of documents itself is part of rectification, and in the next step of launching review and criticism, it is also necessary to repeatedly read the documents, using the spirit of the documents as the standard for summarizing work. Regarding how to link to practical problems, he pointed out that there are basically two methods. One is to start from work to make connections, and the other is to start from the individual to make connections. Based on the preliminary experience of directly affiliated organizations over the past half-month and the report in the July 29th People's Daily on the rectification situation across the country, we should start from work and then connect to the individual. Because in this way, we can discover and solve the main and basic problems in the work, and avoid unprincipled arguments over personal life details. To strengthen the leadership of rectification, leaders must personally take action, conscientiously lead the study, mobilize party member cadres in the study, determine the focus of rectification in their own unit, and promote and influence the enthusiasm of all cadres with their own exemplary role. The CCP branches in the organs should help the leaders complete the rectification plan, become a powerful assistant to the leaders, and be the backbone of the rectification movement, ensuring the promotion of democracy. Regarding the focus of rectification, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, overcoming bureaucracy and commandism is the focus of rectification for the entire party, but each department should determine its own focus of rectification based on its own specific circumstances. That is to say, we should determine what to eliminate and what to promote and strengthen based on the situation of our own department. On the contrary, it is not enough to simply generally propose overcoming bureaucracy and commandism.

### 中共内蒙东部区党委召开会议  提倡学习要联系实际

　　中共内蒙东部区党委召开会议
    提倡学习要联系实际
    【本报讯】中共内蒙东部区党委于八月三日召开直属机关党员干部学习会议，讨论整风学习问题。会上组织部部长高锦明报告半个月来直属单位的学习情况，并指出了今后学习的态度与办法。他说：虽然有些单位采取了学习文件结合检查工作的方法，但有些单位仍走了弯路出了偏向：一种偏向是找过多的参考书，放松对正式文件的学习，或单纯学习文件，死扣条文，不联系实际工作，结果是空空洞洞的一无所获。另一种偏向是不愿学习文件，对文件无兴趣，他们说：“反正迟早也是整，转弯绕圈干啥！”因而过急的强调联系实际，解决问题，认为学习文件是耽误时间。对此问题高部长指出说：根据华北局指示的精神，整风必须有明确的目标，稳健的步骤。首先在一定时间内以阅读文件为主，联系工作，进行初步检查总结，以求深刻了解文件的精神与实质。然后展开批评与自我批评，全面地检查总结工作。但这并不是把整风学习截然分成毫无联系的两个阶段。学习文件的本身，也是整风的一部分，而在下一步展开检讨批评的时候，也必须反复阅读文件，以文件的精神作为总结工作的标准。如何联系实际问题，他指出基本上有两种方法。一种从工作出发进行联系，另一种从个人出发进行联系。根据直属机关半个月的初步经验以及七月二十九日人民日报关于全国各地整风情况的报道，应当是从工作出发，而后联系到个人。因为这样，能发现与解决工作中的主要和基本问题，并可避免无原则的个人生活细节的争论。为加强整风的领导，首长必须亲自动手，认真领导学习，在学习中对党员干部进行启发动员，确定本单位整风的重点，并以自己的模范作用，推动与影响全体干部的积极性。机关中的中共支部要帮助首长完成整风计划，成为首长的有力助手与整风运动的骨干。保障发扬民主。关于整风重点，根据中央和毛主席指示，克服官僚主义与命令主义，这是全党的整风重点，但各部门应根据各个不同的具体情况出发，确定自己的整风重点。即是说应根据自己部门的情况确定整掉什么？推广和加强什么？相反的仅仅一般地提出克服官僚主义，命令主义是不够的。
