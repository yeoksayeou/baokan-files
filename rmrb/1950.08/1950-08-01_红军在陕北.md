　　The Red Army in Northern Shaanxi
    He Chengjian
    The People Love the Red Army
    In 1932, the Red Army led by comrades Gao Mingjin, Liu Shanzhong, Yang Jincai, and others was active in the area of Yanchuan, Yanchang, Qingjian, and Anding (at that time, my uncle joined the Red Army, and I was just a commoner, only sixteen years old). They hid in the mountain caves of Hejia Gou during the day and came out to operate at night, using relatives and friends to spread the word that the Red Army was the people's army, fighting for the people to live a good life, and would fight the local tyrants, distribute land, and eliminate feudalism in the future, so that everyone would have land to cultivate and live a good life. The broad masses of people became more aware and warmly grasped the hands of the Red Army.
    In April, the third squad leader, Feng Zhansheng, and quartermaster Liu Zhicheng fell ill and stayed at my house to recuperate. One morning, the village was suddenly surrounded by more than two hundred enemy soldiers. When they heard the news, they ran out. Comrade Feng Zhansheng was unfortunately shot and killed while running. Thereupon, the enemy insisted that our village was hiding Red Army soldiers, and they hung up all the villagers and beat them with wooden sticks and iron tools. Some people were beaten unconscious, and some were beaten until their heads were bleeding, but no one said where the Red Army was hiding.
    When Comrade Liu Zhicheng discovered that the enemy had entered the village, he retreated and hid in the space between the grain bin and the wall of my uncle's house. My aunt put four or five feet of wool on him. When the enemy searched, they hit the wool several times with sticks, but found nothing and went elsewhere.
    Growing in Battle
    In 1935, I had already joined the Red Army as a communication worker. In May, the Eighty-fourth Division of the Twenty-seventh Red Army passed through the Yangjiatunzi battle in Yanchang and transferred to Wubao. At that time, the equipment of the troops was very poor, and half of the people used red-tasseled spears. At this time, Yan Xishan, the bandit, sent two regiments to attack us. At dawn, we began to attack the enemy. In the hail of bullets, our army bravely advanced and broke through the enemy's nine lines of defense. At about 2 p.m., we occupied the highest ground, annihilated one regiment of the enemy, and seized a large number of weapons and ammunition. As a result, our army's equipment was strengthened, and we could not only carry out guerrilla warfare at night, but also conduct larger-scale battles, and the scope of activities was also expanded compared to before.
    The Red Third Regiment Wisely Annihilated the Enemy
    In September 1935, the Red Third Regiment was ordered to go to the Guanzhong Soviet Area to assist the Guanzhong Guerrilla Detachment in consolidating the Soviet regime. At that time, I was the deputy squad leader in the communications squad of the Red Third Regiment.
    Shanshuicheng was built at the foot of the mountain, and an enemy battalion was stationed there. The city was flanked by mountains, which were more than three miles high. There were many earth forts near the city, and many fortifications were also built on the mountainside, defended by some enemy militias. At that time, our Guanzhong Guerrilla Detachment did not have the strength to eliminate the enemy, but only disturbed them from time to time, firing a few shots on the mountain, and the enemy would come out to pursue. After understanding the situation, Regiment Commander Yuan Guanghua and Political Commissar Gao Weisong decided to use the Red Third Regiment as the main force, in cooperation with the Guanzhong Guerrilla Detachment, to set up an ambush. When a small number of detachment comrades lured the enemy to chase to within forty or fifty meters of our army, our army concentrated its firepower to shoot at the enemy and rushed forward to fight. After an hour of battle, the enemy battalion commander was killed, and more than two hundred enemy soldiers, including the deputy battalion commander, were captured. More than sixty people were killed and wounded, and a small cannon and six light machine guns were seized, as well as a lot of rifles and ammunition. This established the prestige of the Red Army and strengthened the local guerrilla detachment's confidence in continuing the armed struggle.
    Our army bandaged the wounded enemy soldiers, coffined the dead enemy soldiers, and sent them back to the enemy garrison in Shanshuicheng. After a short period of education, some of the prisoners joined our army, and some were given six silver dollars, a pair of shoes and socks, and a pack of cigarettes, and sent home. The stories of the Red Army's heroism and kindness spread widely in the Soviet area and the enemy area.

　　红军在陕北
    贺成健
    人民热爱着红军
    一九三二年高明进、刘善忠、杨进才等同志领导的红军在延川、延长、清涧、安定一带活跃着（那时我的叔父参加了红军，我还是个老百姓，才十六岁）。他们白天隐藏在贺家沟山洞中，黑夜出来活动，通过亲戚朋友，宣传红军是人民的军队，为人民过好日子而斗争，将来要打土豪，分田地，铲除封建，使每一个人都有地种，都可过好的生活。广大的群众觉悟提高了，都亲切地拉紧了红军的手。
    四月间第三队长冯占声、司务长刘志成二同志病了，留在我家休养。有一天早晨，村子忽然被二百多个敌军包围了。他们听了这消息后就往外跑，冯占声同志不幸在奔跑途中被枪杀了，于是敌军一口咬定我村藏有红军，把全村人都吊了起来，用木棒、铁器拷打。有的人被打晕过去了，有的人被打得头破血流，但是没有一个人说出红军藏在什么地方。
    刘志成同志当发现敌军已经进村时，就退了回来，藏在叔父家的粮囤与墙壁空隙处了。婶母在他身上放了四、五尺厚的羊毛，敌人搜查时用棍子向羊毛捶了几次，啥也没发现，就到别处去了。
    在战斗中成长
    一九三五年我已经参加了红军，当交通员。五月，红军第二十七军八十四师经过延长杨家囤子战役，转移到吴堡，那时部队的装备很差，一半人使的是红缨枪。这时，阎匪锡山派了两个团来袭击我们，黎明，我们开始向敌人攻击，在枪林弹雨中我军奋勇前进，突破敌人九道防线，下午二时许，占领了最高地，歼灭了敌人一个团，缴获了大批武器弹药。于是我军的装备增强了，已经不仅可以在夜间活动打游击，而且可以进行较大规模的战斗，活动范围也比以前扩大了。
    红三团智歼敌人
    一九三五年九月，红三团奉命开往关中苏区，负责配合关中游击支队，巩固苏区政权，那时我在红三团通讯班当副班长。
    山水城筑在山脚，驻着敌军一个营，城两边是山，山有三里多高，城附近有很多土堡，山腰也修着很多工事，由一些敌民团防守着，当时我关中游击支队没有力量消灭敌人，只是时常扰乱他们，在山上打几枪，敌人就出来追赶。团长袁光华、政委高维松同志，了解这些情况后，就决定以红三团为主力，配合关中游击支队，布置了埋伏。当少数支队同志诱敌军追赶到离我军四、五十米时，我军一面集中火力向敌人射击，一面就向前冲杀，经过一小时的战斗，敌军营长被打死了，还俘虏了敌军副营长以下二百余人，打死打伤六十多人，缴获小炮一门、轻机枪六挺，还有很多步枪弹药，树立了红军的声威，加强了地方游击支队继续坚持武装斗争的信心。
    我军把负伤的敌军包扎好，死亡的敌军装殓好，给山水城里的敌军驻兵送回去，俘虏们经过了短期教育，一部参加了我军，一部发给白洋六元，一双鞋袜，一筒香烟，遣散回家。红军的英勇善战和宽大仁慈的故事，在苏区、敌区都广泛地流传开了。
