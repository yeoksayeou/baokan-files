Several Problems in Social Development History Readings
    Wang Cheng
    The study of social development history has formed an enthusiastic movement among general cadres, workers, students, and other people. This has played a significant role in transforming thinking and establishing a revolutionary worldview. To meet the needs of the vast number of readers, authors and publishers have produced many readings on social development history. However, there are still many problems in these readings. Here, I would like to raise some issues I have seen for discussion with everyone.
    
    The Basic Issues of Social Development
    Most social development history readings begin by discussing the basic issues of social development, which is indeed one of the most fundamental issues in learning social development history.
    
    So, what is the most basic law of social development? According to the viewpoint of historical materialism, it is the law of production development. On this basic issue, in the social development history readings published recently, except for a very few religious books, most can explain social development from a scientific perspective. However, some works still do not have a correct understanding of some issues related to production. For example, the "Study Outline of Social Development History" published by the Knowledge Bookstore has a "Diagram of Social Structure" attached. In the "Mode of Production" section, it indicates that the mode of production is composed of "labor force" and "means of production" (which should be production tools). Obviously, the so-called "mode of production" here is only one aspect of the mode of production—productive forces; and the other aspect of the mode of production—people's relations of production—is not mentioned. This is an erroneous interpretation of Marxism-Leninism.
    
    Another more common and noteworthy argument regarding the most basic law of social development is expressed in the issue of social productive forces. Many books believe that social productive forces are composed of three elements: labor force, labor tools, and labor objects. This is worth discussing.
    
    I think the saying of three elements is inappropriate. To clarify this issue, first, we must study: What are social productive forces? Stalin gave a brilliant exposition on this issue. He said:
    
    "The instruments of production wherewith material values are produced, the people who operate the instruments of production and carry on the struggle with nature for the production of material values, possessing production experience and labour skill – all these taken together constitute the productive forces of society." (See the Moscow edition of "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" published by the Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House)
    
    That is to say: Social productive forces are composed of two elements: production tools (or instruments of labor) and producers (or labor force). For people (producers), it also particularly emphasizes production experience and labor skills. It does not mention production objects (or objects of labor).
    
    Why are social productive forces composed of two elements: production tools and producers, rather than three elements: production tools, producers, and production objects? Because the concept of social productive forces refers to the relationship between people and objects and the forces of nature, and these objects and forces of nature are used to produce material materials. Understanding this concept will make it clear that the relationship between people and nature, people and the production tools they master are active and positive, and are factors that change faster and are more active in the history of human development. Nature is passive and passive, and its changes are extremely small. If we look at human history, we will understand: human beings have gone from using stone tools to inventing atomic energy, and human beings have evolved from primitive life to highly civilized life. Over the years, nature can be said to have not changed much. From this we can see that the relationship between people and nature depends almost entirely on what tools people use and people's production experience and labor skills. Iron ore was not non-existent in nature in primitive communist society, but people at that time did not use iron tools for production; the materials for manufacturing airplanes and ships also existed in feudal society, but people at that time did not know how to manufacture and use airplanes and ships. Therefore, the degree to which people master the laws of material movement and change in nature plays a major role here. Therefore, the reason why social productive forces do not include the element of production objects is very obvious. Stalin told us: "The state of the productive forces answers the question – with what instruments of production do men produce the material values they need?" It is a concrete answer to this question. In order to further clarify this issue, he gave a vivid picture of the development of productive forces from ancient times to the present. He said:
    
    "Here is a general picture of the development of the productive forces of society throughout human history. The transition from crude stone tools to the bow and arrow, and the accompanying transition from the hunting life to the domestication of animals and primitive pasturage; the transition from stone tools to metal tools (the iron axe, the iron plough, etc.), with a corresponding transition to tillage, to agriculture; further improvement of metal tools for the production of metal, followed by the introduction of the bellows, pottery, and with a corresponding development of handicrafts, the separation of handicrafts from agriculture, the development of independent handicraft production and, subsequently, of manufacture; the transition from handicraft manufacture to machine production, followed by the transformation of manufacture into large-scale machine industry; the transition to the machine system, followed by the appearance of modern large-scale machine industry – such is a general and far from complete picture of the development of the productive forces of society throughout the history of mankind. And it goes without saying that the development and improvement of the instruments of production has been effected by men, and not independently of men; consequently, men, as the most important element of the productive forces, have also been changing and developing all the time with the development and improvement of the instruments of production, with the growth of their experience in production, their skill in operating the instruments of production." (Ibid.)
    
    Stalin's explanation of productive forces is very specific and thorough here. This is a great contribution to historical materialism. However, many works do not explain productive forces in this way. This is a basic theoretical issue worth studying.
    
    The Question of the Origin of Classes
    The history of class struggle is a major content of social development history. Studying social development history requires studying the history of class struggle. In some social development history readings, the understanding of the origin of classes is incorrect. For example:
    
    In the book "Study Outline of Social Development History" by Mr. Shi Xiaochong (World Knowledge Press, June 1950), it says: "Classes have not always existed in human history, nor will they exist forever. Classes only emerged when society developed to a certain historical stage." This is correct. But how did classes arise? He said: "The emergence of classes is due to the division of labor in society, the development of the division of labor, the means of production becoming private, and the establishment of a private property system in society." (See the section "Establishing a Class Viewpoint—Class Struggle") That is to say, the emergence of classes is based on the establishment of the private property system, and the establishment of the private property system is "due to the division of labor in society." This is obviously inappropriate. We can also see the same view in the "Social Development History Study Manual" by Mr. Xue Song (Puwen Publishing House, April 1950). The book says: "The emergence of classes is closely related to the entire course of social development. In the late stage of clan society (primitive communist society), animal husbandry and agriculture had the first division of labor, which led to the development of animal husbandry, especially the development of agriculture, which improved labor productivity, resulting in a surplus of production. The emergence of this surplus production is a major condition for the emergence of classes." (See the chapter "Class Struggle and Revolution") That is to say: the emergence of classes is promoted, the emergence of surplus production is the main condition, and the emergence of surplus production is due to "animal husbandry and agriculture having the first division of labor." From the two examples cited above, we can see a common argument: Due to the division of labor, surplus products appeared. With surplus products, classes emerged. This gives readers the impression that the development of production, leading to the emergence of surplus production and the emergence of classes, is due to "division of labor." Obviously, this understanding is not correct, because division of labor is the result, not the cause. What is the cause? The cause is the development of productive forces. Productive forces develop to a certain stage before there is a division of labor, and then the division of labor promotes the development of productive forces.
    
    I would like to quote Engels' explanation of the origin of classes here. He said:
    
    "The increase of production in all branches — cattle breeding, agriculture, domestic handicrafts — gave human labour-power the capacity to produce a larger product than was required for its maintenance. At the same time it increased the amount of work that daily fell to the lot of each member of the gens, household community or single family. The incorporation of new labour forces became desirable. War supplied these; captives were transformed into slaves. Under the given general historical conditions, the first great social division of labour, by increasing the productivity of labour and therefore wealth, and enlarging the field of production, necessarily carried slavery in its train. Out of the first great social division of labour arose the first great division of society into two classes: masters and slaves, exploiters and exploited." (See Zhang Zhongshi's translation of "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State")
    
    That is to say, the emergence of classes is the result of the growth of productive forces. "Under certain historical conditions," there was a division of labor, and the division of labor promoted the development of production, thereby creating classes. Many works do not have a clear understanding of the intermediate relationship in the emergence of classes, so they do not look at the issue from the basic perspective of the growth of productive forces. Simply saying that the division of labor leads to the emergence of classes is incorrect.
    
    The Question of Labor
    Studying social development history can enable us to know the truth that labor creates man and labor creates the world, so that we can understand that man was not created by God, but developed in the process of labor, and the history of social development was not created by any "God" or ghosts, or any heroes, but the result of human labor. In this way, we will realize that the working people are the masters of society and the value of labor, eliminate the various erroneous ideas of the old society that despise the working people and believe that labor is shameful, and thereby establish a labor viewpoint.
    
    But what exactly is the meaning of the so-called labor here? This question is not answered satisfactorily in all readings on social development history. I once read the "Simplified Table of Social Development History" published by the Reader Bookstore, which mentioned that the tools used by the primitive group were "natural branches and stones." Obviously, on this issue, the author's understanding of labor is still vague. By labor, we mean people using tools for production and producing means of livelihood. In ancient times, apes only knew how to use natural branches and stones. After years of labor, they learned to make tools (stone tools) and used tools for production. In this way, they distinguished themselves from animals and became human beings. Therefore, Engels said in the essay "The Role of Labor in the Transformation from Ape to Man": "Labor begins with the making of tools." He also said: "Not a single ape hand has ever made the crudest stone knife." Obviously, the labor we mean by labor creating the world refers to this kind of labor. If we say that the "tools" used by the primitive group were "natural branches and stones," how can we say that they were tools? Since they used "natural branches and stones," how could they be human?
    
    Mr. Jia Zuzhang's "Labor Creates Man" (published by Kaiming Bookstore) is also not very clear on this issue. In the process of change from ape to man, he pointed out various changes in the ape's body, pointing out that these changes were also due to labor. But what is the meaning of this "labor"? Is this the same as the labor that is a characteristic of humans? The book does not explain. People will ask: many other animals also "labor", aren't beehives and spider webs woven very delicately? What is the difference between their "labor" and the labor we are talking about?
    
    Marxism-Leninism tells us that the history of social development is first and foremost the history of production development, and the changes and development of production always begin with the changes and development of production tools. Therefore, a correct understanding of labor is not only related to the issue of transformation from ape to man, but also related to the basic issues of the entire social development, and is worthy of attention.
    
    The Question of New Democracy and the Superstructure
    The table of contents of general social development history works are mostly like this: primitive communist society, slave society, feudal society, capitalist society, socialist and communist society. As for the new democratic society that is very relevant to us, it is generally not mentioned.
    
    Obviously, it is a defect to talk about the history of social development without linking it to reality and without talking about new democracy. Books published earlier may have justifiable reasons due to insufficient conditions, but it is absolutely necessary to make appropriate explanations about the new democratic society in newly published readings.
    
    Also, the fact that many social development history works do not talk about the superstructure of society is also a major defect. Because there are various kinds of misconceptions about the state, political parties, religion, art, ideology, etc. in many people's minds, and these misconceptions should be clarified.
    
    Other
    The above are the descriptions of some shortcomings existing in social development history readings, but it does not mean that there are no successful works in social development history readings. What should be particularly mentioned here is that the two books "Historical Materialism—Teaching Outline of Social Development History" and "Historical Materialism—Lectures on Social Development History" written by Comrade Ai Siqi are relatively well written. In addition to the "Brief History of Social Development" published by the Liberation Society, these two books are very helpful for beginners. Because the author can "use the history of social development as the backbone to explain several major points of historical materialism." And can link to reality, so that readers can not only have a general understanding of the development of society from the study of the history of social development, but also can establish the idea of labor creating the world, the idea of class struggle, and the Marxist theory of the state from the study. So as to achieve the purpose of transforming old ideas and establishing new ideas of serving the people. Comrade Ai Siqi's two works should be recommended to readers.

　　社会发展史读物中的若干问题
    王城
    学习社会发展史，在一般干部、工人、学生及其他人民间形成了热烈的运动。这对于改造思想，建立革命的人生观，起了重大的作用。著作者和出版者为了适应广大读者的需要，关于社会发展史的读物出版得很多。不过，在这些读物中还存在着许多问题，这里就个人所见到的若干问题，提出来与大家商讨。
    社会发展的基础问题
    大多数社会发展史的读物，开头总谈到社会发展的基础问题，这确乎是学习社会发展史中的一个最基本的问题。
    那么，社会发展最基本的规律是什么呢？按照历史唯物主义的见解，就是生产发展的规律。在这个基本问题上，近来出版的社会发展史的读物中，除了极少数几本宗教书之外，一般都能根据科学观点来解释社会发展。但是，有些著作中，对于有关生产的一些问题了解得还不大正确。比方说，知识书店出版的“社会发展史学习提纲”一书，附有一个“社会构造图解”，在“生产方式”一项里，标明生产方式系“劳动力”与“生产手段”（按应为生产工具）两者构成的。显而易见，这里所谓“生产方式”，只不过是生产方式的一个方面——生产力；而生产方式的另外一方面——人们的生产关系，就没有提到。这是对马列主义的错误解释。
    对于社会发展最基本规律另外一种较普遍的值得商讨的论点，表现在关于社会的生产力的问题上。很多书认为社会的生产力是劳动力、劳动工具和劳动对象三个要素构成的。这是值得商榷的。
    我认为三个要素的说法不妥。为了搞清这个问题，首先，我们必须研究一下：什么是社会的生产力呢？斯大林对这个问题有过杰出的阐述。他说：
    “生产物质资料时所使用的生产工具，以及因有相当生产经验和劳动技能而发动着生产工具并实现着物质资料生产的人——这些要素总合起来，就构成社会的生产力。”（见苏联外国文书籍出版局莫斯科版“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”）
    这就是说：社会的生产力是生产工具（或劳动工具）和生产者（或劳动力）两方面的要素构成的。对于人（生产者）来说，又特别强调生产经验和生产技能。这里没有提到生产对象（或劳动对象）。
    为什么社会的生产力是生产工具与生产者两要素所构成，而不是生产工具、生产者和生产对象三要素所构成呢？因为社会的生产力这一概念，是表明人们对于物件和自然界力量的关系而说的，而这些物件和自然界力量是被利用来生产物质资料的。明白了这一概念，就会知道：人与自然的关系，人们以及他们所掌握的生产工具，是主动的、积极的，是在人类发展史中变化较快、比较活跃的因素。而自然界则是消极的，被动的，它的变化极其微小。我们看一看人类的历史就会明白：人类从最初使用石器到现在发明了原子能，人类从原始生活进化到高度文明，而这多年来，自然界可以说没有什么很大变化。由此可知，人与自然的关系，几乎完全取决于人们运用什么工具，取决于人们的生产经验和生产技能。铁矿在原始共产社会并不是在自然界不存在的，但人们当时并不会用铁器进行生产；制造飞机和轮船的材料在封建社会也存在的，那时人们可并不会制造和使用飞机轮船。所以说人们对于自然界物质运动变化法则掌握的程度，在这里是起着重大的作用的。因此，社会的生产力不包含生产对象这一要素在内，理由是很明显的。斯大林告诉我们：“生产力的状况所回答的问题是人们用怎样的生产工具来生产他们所必需的物质资料的问题”正是具体的解答了这个问题。他为了进一步阐明这个问题，曾把从古到今生产力发展的情景，给了一个鲜明的图画。他说：
    “以下便是从古到今日的生产力发展的一般情景。由粗笨的石器过渡到弓箭，并与此相适应由狩猎生活过渡到驯养动物和原始畜牧；由石器过渡到金属工具（铁斧、铁口锄等等），并与此相适应而过渡到种植植物，过渡到农业；金属的制造工具继续改良，过渡到冶铁风箱，过渡到陶器生产，并与此相适应而有手工业的发展，手工业脱离农业的分立，独立手工业生产以及后来手工业工厂生产的发展；由手工业生产过渡到机器，手工业工厂生产转变为机器工业；再进而过渡到机器制，以及现代机器化工业的出现，——就是人类史上社会生产力发展的一个大致而远不完备的情景。同时，生产工具的发展和改善当然是由参加生产的人们所实现，而不是与人们无关，所以，由于生产工具的变更和发展，人们，即生产力中最重要的原素，也随着变更和发展起来，他们的生产经验，劳动技能以及运用生产工具的本领，也随着变更和发展。”（同上书）
    斯大林关于生产力的解释，在这里说得非常具体透彻。这是对于历史唯物主义的伟大贡献。然而，很多著作对于生产力的解释并不是这样。这是一个值得研究的基本理论问题。
    阶级起源问题
    阶级斗争的历史是社会发展史的一个主要内容。学习社会发展史必须研究阶级斗争的历史。在若干社会发展史的读物中，关于阶级起源的理解是不正确的。例如：
    石啸冲先生著的“社会发展史学习提纲”（世界知识社一九五○年六月版）一书中说：“阶级在人类历史中不是向来就存在的，也不是永远存在着。只有在社会发展到一定的历史阶段才产生了阶级。”这是不错的。但阶级是怎样产生的呢？他说：“阶级的产生是由于社会有了分工，分工有了发展，生产手段变成私有，社会建立了私有财产制度。”（见“建立阶级观点——阶级斗争”一节）这就是说，阶级产生是基于私有财产制度的建立，而私有财产制度的建立，则“由于社会有了分工”。这显然是不妥当的。同样的见解，我们还可以在雪松先生著的“社会发展史学习手册”（普文出版社一九五○年四月版）中见到。该书说：“阶级的出现是跟社会发展的全部行程密切联系着的，在氏族社会（原始公产社会）末期，畜牧业和农业已有了第一次的分工，因而畜牧业发达，尤其是农业的发达，提高了劳动生产性，因而有了生产品的剩余，这剩余生产品的出现，是阶级出现的一个主要条件。”（见“阶级斗争与革命”一章）这也就是说：促使阶级的产生，剩余生产品的出现是主要条件，而剩余生产品的出现，是由于“畜牧业和农业已有了第一次的分工。”从上面所引的两个例子我们可以看到一个共同的论点：由于分工，出现了剩余生产物，有了剩余生产物，才产生阶级。这就给读者一种印象，以为生产的发展以至有了剩余生产物而产生阶级，是因为“分工”的缘故。显然，这样的理解不是正确的，因为分工是果，并不是因。因是什么呢？因就是生产力的发展。生产力发展到一定的阶段，才有分工，从而分工又促进了生产力的发展。
    我愿在这里引用恩格斯关于阶级产生的说明，他说：
    “在一切部门——牧畜、农业、家内的手工业——的生产之增进，足使人类劳动力生产比维持生活所必需的更多之物。同时它更增大氏族家，或单一家族的每个成员所负担之每日劳动量。新的劳动力之参加，是所欢迎的事情。它由战争而得供给——把俘虏转变为奴隶。在一定的历史条件之下，社会劳动之最初的大分业，是因劳动生产性之增进，富之加多，必然地要引起奴隶制的。从社会劳动之最初的大分业，发生了社会之最初的大分裂，即主人与奴隶，榨取者与被榨取者之二阶级。”（见张仲实译“家族私有财产及国家之起源”）
    这就是说，阶级的产生，是生产力增长的结果，“在一定的历史条件下”有了分工，分工又促成生产的发展，从而产生阶级。许多著作中对于阶级产生的这中间的关系搞得不大清楚，因此就没有从生产力的增长这一基本观点来看问题，简单地说，有了分工，就产生阶级，这是不对的。
    劳动问题
    学习社会发展史，可以使我们知道劳动创造了人、劳动创造世界的道理，从而使我们明白：人不是上帝造的，是在劳动的过程中发展成的，社会发展的历史，也不是什么“上帝”鬼神创造的，或什么英雄好汉创造的，而是人类劳动的结果。这样，就会使我们认识到劳动人民才是社会的主人和劳动的可贵，消除旧社会看不起劳动人民，认为劳动可耻的种种错误观念，从而建立起劳动观点来。
    但这里所谓劳动，它的含义究竟是什么呢？这个问题，在关于社会发展史的读物中，并不是都能回答得令人满意。我曾读过读者书店出版的“社会发展史简表”，其中有原始群所用的工具为“天然的木枝和石块”一点。显然，在这个问题上，表现作者对于劳动的了解还是模糊的。我们所谓劳动，指人利用工具进行生产，生产生活资料而言。在古时候，类人猿只会使用天然的木枝石块，由于多少年的劳动，他们才学会制造工具（石器），用工具进行生产。这样他们就把自己从动物中区别开来，变成了人。因此，恩格斯在“劳动在从猿到人过程中的作用”论文中说：“劳动是同制造工具一起开始的。”又说：“没有一只猿手曾经制造过一把最粗笨的石刀。”很明显，我们所谓劳动创造世界，就是指这种劳动说的。如果说原始群所用的“工具”是“天然的木枝石块”，怎么能说那是工具？既然他们所用的是“天然的木枝石块”，他们又怎么是人呢？
    贾祖璋先生著的“劳动创造了人”（开明书店出版），对于这个问题的说明也不大清楚。他在从猿到人的变化过程中，指出类人猿身体上种种的变化，指出这些变化，也都是因为劳动的关系。但这种“劳动”的含义是什么呢？这和作为人的特点的劳动是否同样的呢？书中没有交代。人们会问：旁的很多动物也会“劳动”啊，蜜蜂的巢，蜘蛛的网不是造织得很精致吗？它们的“劳动”与我们所说的劳动有什么区别呢？
    马列主义告诉我们：社会发展史，首先就是生产发展史，而生产的变更和发展，无论何时又首先从生产工具的变更和发展开始。所以，对于劳动的正确理解，不仅关系到从猿到人这个问题，同时也关系到整个社会发展的基本问题，是值得注意的。
    关于新民主主义与上层建筑问题
    一般社会发展史的著作，目次大都是这样的：原始共产主义社会、奴隶社会、封建社会、资本主义社会、社会主义和共产主义社会，至于跟我们非常有关的新民主主义社会，大都没有讲到。
    显而易见，讲社会发展史，不联系实际，不讲新民主主义，是一个缺陷。出版较早的书，或者因为条件不够，尚有可说，新出版的读物中对新民主主义社会作适当的说明，是完全必要的。
    还有，很多社会发展史的著作没有讲社会的上层建筑这一部分，也是一个大缺陷。因为关于国家、政党、宗教、艺术、思想意识等等，在不少人的脑子里存在着各式各样的错误观念，这些错误观念，是应该澄清的。
    其他
    以上所述，是说明社会发展史读物中存在的一些缺点，但并不是说，在社会发展史的读物中没有成功的著作。这里特别应当提出的是：艾思奇同志所著“历史唯物论——社会发展史讲授提纲”与“历史唯物论——社会发展史讲义”这两本书写得比较好。除了解放社出版的“社会发展简史”外，这两本书对初学读者的帮助很大。因为作者能“以社会发展史为骨干，来说明历史唯物主义的几个主要论点。”且能联系实际，使读者从社会发展史的学习中，不但对社会的发展有一轮廓的认识，而且能从学习中建立劳动创造世界、阶级斗争的思想与马克思主义的国家学说。从而达到改造旧思想，建立为人民服务的新思想的目的。艾思奇同志这两本著作，是应当向读者推荐的。
    一九五○、八、十五。
