Inspecting Leadership's Inspection Work
    Northeast Railway System Begins Rectification

    [Northeast News] The rectification movement in the Northeast Railway System has been widely launched. A mass work conference, a conference on economic accounting, and a transportation work conference are planned to be held in phases during August and September to inspect and implement the economic accounting system and improve the relationship between the Party and the masses and external relations, as the focus of the rectification movement.

    In mid-June, the Northeast Railway Party Committee convened a rectification mobilization meeting. Since late June, it has been studying rectification documents and has conducted preliminary self-criticism targeting the shortcomings and errors in the work of various departments. It has now entered the stage of inspecting leadership and inspecting work. The Joint Rectification Committee of the Political Department of the Northeast Railway, the Northeast Regional Committee of the Railway Trade Union of China, and the Northeast Railway Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League recently held several meetings of Party member cadres above the section chief level. With the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, the leadership style and the past lack of close relations between the Party, government, and trade union, inconsistent work pace, and the losses suffered in guaranteeing the completion of transportation tasks were reviewed. Research on how to improve future work is still ongoing.

    The focus of the rectification of the China Changchun Railway Bureau is mainly on checking the attitude and methods of learning advanced experience from Soviet comrades. It was found that although the enthusiasm of the vast majority of comrades for learning from the Soviet Union was high, some comrades had a rather strong tendency towards being overly ambitious and sticking to conventions. They were insensitive to some of the advanced Soviet experiences and methods being promoted, and did not learn from actual work in a down-to-earth manner. On the one hand, they shouted slogans about learning a complete set of things, and on the other hand, they felt that there was nothing to learn from these things. Some also believed that the Soviet methods were good, but they would not work on the current Chinese railways, and it was useless to learn them. During the rectification, the above-mentioned erroneous thoughts and attitudes were reviewed and criticized, and advanced Soviet experience was boldly accepted, and some work systems were improved. For example, the Supervision Office previously had forty-seven types of forms, which have now been reduced to twelve, which is not only simpler and more economical, but also allows for a clearer understanding of the work situation.

    The Qiqihar Railway Bureau convened a rectification meeting of cadres above the department head level in mid-July, and found that in the past, the leadership assigned many tasks, the requirements were not specific enough, the instructions lacked methods, and the work pace of the Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Youth League was inconsistent. It also formulated preliminary improvement measures based on the actual situation. The Jinzhou and Jilin Railway Bureaus and their branches have also begun to inspect their work.

    However, there are also some shortcomings in the current rectification work of various bureaus and units. For example, some have unclear rectification guidelines, believing that the railway is too complicated and there are many problems, and they do not know what to rectify; some mechanically divide the study of documents and the inspection of work into two stages, and the inspection of work is very superficial and lacks focus; some have insufficient democratic development, criticism and self-criticism have not been carried out, and in the meetings, a few leading cadres speak more, and the cadres below have no opportunity to speak. The East Railway Party Committee and the Party Committees of various bureaus are correcting these shortcomings.

### 检查领导检查工作  东北铁路系统开始整风

　　检查领导检查工作
    东北铁路系统开始整风
    【东北讯】东北铁路系统的整风运动已普遍开展。并拟于八、九月间分期召开群众工作会议、关于经济核算的会议及运输工作会议，检查并贯彻经济核算制和改善党群关系及对外关系，作为整风运动的重点。
    六月中旬，东北铁路党委即召开整风动员会，自六月下旬开始学习整风文件，并针对各部门工作中的缺点和错误，进行了初步的检讨，现已进入检查领导和检查工作阶段。东北铁路政治部、中国铁路工会东北地区委员会、中国新民主主义青年团东北铁路委员会联合整风委员会，最近曾数度召开课长以上党员干部会，以批评与自我批评的精神，检讨了领导作风及过去党政工关系不密切，工作步调不一致，对保证生产完成运输任务所受到的损失。现仍在继续研究如何改进今后工作。
    中长铁路局的整风重点，主要是检查向苏联同志学习先进经验的态度和方法问题。检查出绝大多数同志向苏联学习的热情虽高，但有些同志好高鹜远和墨守成规的思想相当浓厚，对所推行的一些苏联的先进经验和方法失去敏感，不切切实实的从实际工作中学习，一方面空喊要学一套，另方面又觉得这些东西没有什么可学；也有的认为苏联的办法是好，但在目前中国铁路上行不通，学也无用。整风中对上述错误的思想和态度进行了检讨和批评，并大胆的接受苏联的先进经验，改进了一些工作制度。如监察室过去有四十七种表格，现在改为十二种，不但简便、节约，而且还能更清楚的了解工作情况。
    齐齐哈尔铁路局于七月中旬召开了处长以上干部的整风会，检查出过去领导上分配任务多，要求不具体，指示办法少，党、行政、工会和青年团工作步调不一致等缺点，并根据实际情况初步制定了改进办法。锦州及吉林两铁路局及各分局亦开始检查工作。
    但目前各局各单位的整风工作也存在着若干缺点，如有的整风方针不明确，认为铁路太复杂问题很多，不知整什么好；有的把学习文件和检查工作机械的分作两个阶段，检查工作又很浮泛，没有重点；有的民主发扬不够，批评和自我批评没有展开，开起会来几个领导干部讲的多，下边干部无发言机会。这些缺点，东铁党委及各局党委正在进行纠正。
