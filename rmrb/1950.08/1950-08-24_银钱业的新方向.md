　　New Directions for the Banking Industry
    The National Joint Conference of the Financial Industry was successfully convened in Beijing on August 1st and closed on August 10th. The convening of this conference took place after the Central People's Government successfully curbed the twelve-year-long inflation and stabilized prices. Based on the Central People's Government's general policy of adjusting industry and commerce, this conference discussed adjusting and transforming the three most important relationships in China's financial industry. These are: First, adjusting the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce; second, adjusting the public-private relationship within the financial industry; and third, adjusting the labor-capital relationship within the financial industry. The purpose of adjusting these three relationships is to enable China's financial industry to adapt to the new situation of currency stability and fulfill its task of supporting industry and commerce, developing production, and prospering the economy.
    The past development of China's banking industry was deformed. Around 1911, China began to establish banks. However, because China's national industry and commerce suffered long-term oppression and devastation from imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the banking industry could not be integrated with industry and commerce, and was instead coerced and utilized by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Imperialism used banks and money shops in China to purchase native products and promote foreign goods; feudal warlords and the Kuomintang's four major families used banks and money shops to plunder wealth and raise funds for civil wars. The banking industry clustered in Shanghai, largely relying on imperialist and bureaucratic capital, pursuing speculative profits in government bonds, gold and silver, foreign currencies, and real estate. Since the War of Resistance Against Japan, inflation has lasted for twelve years, deepening the suffering of the people. While industry and commerce declined, the banking industry showed a deformed prosperity. These banking institutions at the time either directly participated in speculation or were linked to speculative operations in industry and commerce. Therefore, their development and prosperity were built on the foundation of speculation. Speculation and exorbitant profits corrupted the banking industry, causing them to blindly expand their institutions, add personnel, raise salaries, and engage in extravagance and waste; gradually, they became detached from legitimate industry and commerce, and even more detached from the people. This development and prosperity were false, leading to an abnormal increase in banking institutions in large cities, while in small and medium-sized cities they decreased sharply. Although their speculative profits and interest rates, and interest rate spreads were very high, and their income was large, the actual value of deposits decreased. After currency stabilization in March of this year, the shortcomings of the banking industry were fully exposed, and a serious crisis occurred. According to surveys, the balance of deposits in private banks and money shops was only one-fortieth of the pre-war level, but their personnel still accounted for 66% of the pre-war level. Therefore, the recent concentrated closures of banks and money shops in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places were caused. According to surveys in seven major cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an, there were 446 private banks and money shops at the end of 1949, but only 213 at the end of June 1950, with 233 closures, accounting for 52% of the total number of original private banks and money shops.
    However, a new era has arrived in which China's banking industry is supporting industry and commerce, and striving to develop production and prosper the economy. At present, currency and prices have both stabilized, the possibility of speculation is shrinking, and legitimate banking credit systems have the conditions to be re-established. After the adjustment of industry and commerce, it has gradually entered a solid development path. Therefore, the banking industry has also been able to carry out normal deposit, loan, and remittance businesses to support the development of legitimate industry and commerce. The adjustment of the three relationships called for by the National Joint Conference of the Financial Industry will place the financial industry in difficulty on a normal foundation.
    To adjust the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce, the direction of the financial industry serving industry and commerce should be determined, making the financial industry an indispensable part of the national economy, developing with the development of industry and commerce. At present, there are still some problems in the relationship between the financial industry and industry and commerce that need to be solved urgently. First, the connection between the financial industry and industry and commerce should be strengthened. At present, this connection is not very deep or widespread. For example, among the more than 30,000 industrial and commercial households in Wuhan, only 3,000 have connections with banks and money shops, accounting for 10% of the total number of industrial and commercial households; in Beijing, only 9.7% of industrial and commercial households have business dealings with banks and money shops. This situation should be improved. Second, in terms of deposits and loans, the current requirements of the banking industry are: higher interest rates, larger interest rate spreads, and shorter terms. However, the requirements of industry and commerce are the opposite. They require lower interest rates, smaller interest rate spreads, and longer terms. In this case, it creates the current unreasonable contradiction: on the one hand, industry and commerce suffer from not being able to find circulating funds; on the other hand, the banking industry suffers from having money to lend out. This situation also needs to be adjusted urgently. Because the purpose of the financial industry is to support industry and commerce, to achieve the development of production, and to prosper the economy; since the financial industry is a part of industry and commerce, then its duty should be to strive to absorb social funds and support the development of industry and commerce. In particular, private banks and money shops should strengthen the spirit of service in this area. Under this spirit, the past methods of deposits and loans that simply started from the perspective of profit should be changed. It should be recognized that the financial industry's support for industry and commerce should not only provide as much capital as possible, but also provide as cheap capital as possible. It should be recognized that interest is a part of surplus value, and the level of interest rates should be limited to what the average profit rate of industry and commerce can afford. The current interest rate is too high; the interest rate spread is still too large. Taking Shanghai as an example, the highest loan interest rate recently is 3.9% per month, which is about twice as high as before the war. The pre-war deposit and loan interest rate spread was about 1 to 3, while the current rate is 1 to 6. This obviously needs to be adjusted. Of course, at present, private banks and money shops have difficulties in attracting deposits, funds are short, and the position is not enough to cope with. Therefore, too large and too fast adjustment of interest rates will also aggravate the existing difficulties of private banks and money shops. However, in order to help industry and commerce reduce production costs, the current interest rate should be gradually reduced, and the interest rate spread should be gradually reduced, in order to reach the pre-war level, which is very necessary. In addition, private banks and money shops should also strive to streamline institutions, save expenses, and reduce costs, in order to achieve the purpose of not having to reduce deposit interest rates, but being able to reduce loan interest rates. The loan term should also be based on the principle of adapting to the requirements of industry and commerce. The financial industry should not only expand its connection with industry and commerce, but also deepen this connection, understand the business plans of industry and commerce, so as to appropriately support and supervise its production to ensure that loans reach legitimate purposes.
    The public-private relationship in the financial industry should also be adjusted. In this regard, state-owned banks should take the lead, and through financial management and business contacts, organize the strength of the banking industry, help each other, take care of each other, and develop together. At present, there are still some wrong ideas in the public-private relationship in the financial industry. Some people mistakenly believe that the public and private sectors are mutually exclusive, and that the development of state-owned banks affects the decline of the business of banks and money shops, and thus put forward the so-called "who should eat this bowl of rice" question. However, the facts prove that in the past six months, when private banks and money shops have experienced a large number of closures, state-owned banks have developed faster than private banks and money shops in terms of institutions and business. But this is the result of implementing the agency treasury and implementing cash management. For example, private deposits in state-owned banks only account for 8%, and 90% of industrial and commercial businesses have not had business relations with banks and money shops. It can be seen that the development of state-owned banks does not affect the development of private banks and money shops. Fundamentally speaking, the development of China's financial industry cannot meet the needs of the entire social and economic development. Therefore, the correct public-private relationship should be to unite the public and private forces in the financial industry, and seek common development on the basis of supporting production, in order to meet the needs of the national economy. Businesses that private banks and money shops can handle should be allowed to handle. However, the responsibilities of state-owned banks in supporting the restoration and development of the national economy are different from those of ordinary private banks and money shops. First of all, it must strive to complete the special tasks entrusted to state-owned banks by the government and meet the needs of the country and the people. Secondly, according to Article 39 of the Common Program, it must lead, supervise and help private financial undertakings that operate according to law; as long as private banks and money shops strive to serve production and support legitimate industry and commerce, state-owned banks can also provide necessary support. State-owned banks should establish extensive business contacts with private banks and money shops. In business, state-owned banks should assist private banks and money shops in allocating funds, developing remittances, and facilitating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas; when credit delays occur, they can take the form of transfer deposits to help private banks and money shops overcome difficulties. At present, state-owned banks are planning to conduct transfer mortgage business to reduce the worries of private banks and money shops in the process of supporting industry and commerce, and to provide accommodation in times of financial difficulties. However, private banks and money shops should abandon the idea of simply relying on state-owned banks, such as requiring state-owned banks to provide unlimited transfer mortgages, transfer deposits, and fixed interest rate increases. Private banks and money shops should strive to transform themselves, and seek development in actively supporting industry and commerce, so as to obtain appropriate help from state-owned banks.
    The labor-capital relationship in the financial industry should also continue to be adjusted. The government's competent authorities and trade unions should help both labor and capital to conduct negotiations. Strive to streamline and save, improve operations, and transform the unreasonable operating methods formed by private banks and money shops during the past inflation period. Change the institutions, personnel, and expenses of the financial industry to be able to adapt to the new situation of currency stability. We hope that the employees in private banks and money shops will completely abandon the profit-seeking operating methods, and at the same time, do not emphasize generous treatment standards. The past false prosperity of private banks and money shops was not good for the national economy; the past prosperous life of employees was also built on the poverty of the vast majority of the people. It is not worth remembering and recalling, and we should think from the perspective of long-term interests and strive to gradually change old habits. At present, the treatment of employees in private banks and money shops is still much higher than the treatment of employees in state-owned banks. According to surveys in North China, the treatment of employees in private banks is one and a half to three times higher than the treatment of state-owned banks. This is obviously not conducive to operation.
    We believe that after the adjustment of the banking industry, all those who seriously transform themselves and strive to support legitimate industry and commerce will have certain development and improvement. The deposit and loan business of the banking industry has doubled since March, and is still increasing. With the price stability and the gradual improvement of industry and commerce, the financial industry itself will continue to develop if it is streamlined and economical. The key now is whether private banks and money shops are willing to resolutely and effectively carry out this transformation.
    Generally speaking, large banks have a long history and assets, which are good conditions; however, if the institutions are bloated, there are many personnel, and the expenses are huge, it will still be difficult to overcome the difficulties if streamlining and savings are not carried out effectively. Small and medium-sized banks and money shops have small capital and greater risks during periods of credit stagnation; however, the business situation of adopting the form of joint operations has improved. In the future, if the joint venture organization can be strengthened and the centralized use of funds is further strengthened, there is a future.
    The banking industry seeks improvement and development from supporting industry and commerce and self-transformation. This is the direction pointed out by the National Joint Conference of the Financial Industry. We hope that the employees of private banks and money shops will earnestly study and implement it in order to strive for business improvement. Similarly, the staff of state-owned banks should also study and implement the policies of the National Joint Conference of the Financial Industry and unite with private banks and money shops to achieve the goal of supporting the development of legitimate industry and commerce.

　　银钱业的新方向
    全国金融业联席会议八月一日于北京召开，八月十日胜利闭幕。这次会议的召开，是在中央人民政府胜利地制止了十二年来的通货膨胀，使物价趋向稳定之后。这次会议，根据了中央人民政府调整工商业的总方针，商讨了调整与改造我国金融业最重要的三种关系。这就是：第一、调整金融业与工商业的关系；第二、调整金融业中的公私关系；第三、调整金融业中的劳资关系。调整这三种关系的目的，是为了使我国金融业能够适应通货稳定的新情况，完成其扶植工商业、发展生产、繁荣经济的任务。
    中国银钱业过去的发展是畸形的。在一九一一年前后，我国开始有银行的创立。但是，由于中国民族工商业饱受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义长期的压制与摧残，以致银钱业不能与工商业相结合，而被帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义所胁持与利用。帝国主义利用银行钱庄在我国收购土产、推销洋货；封建军阀和国民党四大家族通过银行钱庄搜括财富，筹措内战军费。银钱业麇集上海，大部依靠帝国主义和官僚资本，追求公债、金银、外币和房地产等投机的利润。抗日战争以来，通货膨胀绵延十二年，人民困苦加深，正当工商业凋敝，然而银钱业却呈现畸形的繁荣，当时的这些银钱业，或直接参与投机，或与工商业中的投机经营相连结，因此，他们的发展与繁荣，是建筑在投机的基础之上的。投机与暴利腐蚀了银钱业，使他们盲目地扩大机构，增添人员，提高待遇，铺张浪费；逐渐脱离了对正当工商业的联系，更脱离了人民。这一发展与繁荣是虚假的，造成了银行机构在大城市的畸形增加，在中小城市则急剧减少。虽然他们的投机利润和利率、利差都很高，收益很大，但存款实值反而减少。今年三月通货稳定后，银钱业的缺点完全暴露，发生了严重的危机。据调查，各私营行庄存款的余额，只有战前的四十分之一，但其人员却还有战前的百分之六十六。因此，造成了不久以前京、津、沪等地行庄集中倒闭的情况。据京、津、沪、汉、广州、重庆及西安等七大城市调查，一九四九年底有私营行庄四四六家，一九五○年六月底仅有二一三家，倒闭了二三三家，占原有私营行庄总数的百分之五十二。
    但是，现在我国银钱业扶助工商业，为发展生产繁荣经济而努力的新时期，已经到来了。目前通货和物价都均已趋向稳定，投机的可能性已日趋缩小，正当的银行信用制度有条件重新建立。工商业调整后，已逐渐进入坚实发展的道路。因之，银钱业也已经有可能开展正常的存款、放款和汇款等业务，以扶助正当工商业的发展。全国金融业联席会议所号召的调整三种关系，将把困难中的金融业放在正常的基础之上。
    要调整金融业与工商业的关系，应该确定金融业为工商业服务的方向，使金融业成为国民经济中不可缺少的组成部分，随着工商业的发展而发展。目前在金融业与工商业的关系中，还存在着一些问题，亟待解决。首先，金融业与工商业的联系应该密切起来。目前这种联系是很不深入和不广泛的。如武汉市三万余户工商业中，与银钱业有联系的仅有三千户，即占工商业总户数的百分之十；北京市工商业与银钱业有来往的，也只占全体工商户的百分之九点七。这种情况是应该努力改善的。其次，在存放款方面，目前银钱业的要求是：利率要高些，利差要大些，期限要短些。但工商业的要求相反。他们要求利率要低些，利差要小些，期限要长些。在这种情况下，就造成目前不合理的矛盾现象：一方面，工商业苦于找不到周转的资金；另一方面，银钱业苦于有钱放不出去。这种情况也是亟应加以调整的。因为金融业既然以扶助工商业，达到发展生产，繁荣经济为目的；金融业既然为工商业的一部分，那末，它的职责就应该是努力吸收社会资金，扶助工商业的发展。特别是私营行庄更应该在这一方面加强服务的精神。在这种精神下，过去那种单纯从赢利观点出发的存款和放款的办法，就应该有所改变。应该认识，金融业对工商业的扶助，不仅要做到尽可能地供给资金，并且应该做到尽可能地供给便宜的资金。应该认识，利息是剩余价值的一部分，利率的高低，应以工商业平均利润率所能负担的为限度。现在的利率是过高的；利差也仍嫌过大。以上海来说，最近放款利率，最高为月息三分九，较战前约高出一倍。战前存放款利差约为一与三之比，而目前则为一与六之比。这显然是应该调整的。当然，目前私营行庄吸收存款有困难，资金短绌，头寸不够应付，因此，过大过速地调整利率，也将加重私营行庄现有的困难。但是，为了扶助工商业降低生产成本，现在的利率应逐渐降低，利差应逐渐缩小，以便达到战前的水平，这是很必要的。此外，私营行庄还应该力求精简机构，节省开支，减低成本，才能做到不必降低存款利息，而能减低放款利率的目的。放款期限亦应以适应工商业的要求为原则。金融业不但要扩大与工商业的联系，并且还应该深入这种联系，了解工商业的业务计划，以便适当地加以扶助，监督其生产，以保证贷款达到正当的用途。
    金融业中的公私关系，同样应该加以调整，在这一方面，国家银行应负起领导的责任，通过金融管理与业务联系，把银钱业的力量组织起来，互相帮助，互相照顾，共同发展。目前在金融业的公私关系中，还存在着一些错误的思想。有的人错误地认为目前公私之间是互相排挤的，认为国家银行的发展，影响了行庄业务的衰退，因而提出所谓“一碗饭该谁吃”的问题。但是，事实证明，近半年来，当着私营行庄发生大批倒闭的时候，国家银行在机构与业务上，虽然比私营行庄发展得快些。但这是执行代理国库、实行现金管理的结果。比如，在国家银行中的私人存款只占百分之八，此外还有百分之九十的工商业未与银钱业发生业务关系。由此可见国家银行的发展，并不影响私营行庄的发展。从根本上说，中国金融业的发展，还不能满足整个社会经济发展的需要。因此，正确的公私关系，应该是团结金融业中的公私力量，在扶持生产的基础上求得共同的发展，才能满足国民经济的需要。凡是私营行庄可以办理的业务，应当准许办理。但国家银行在扶助国民经济的恢复与发展中，所负的职责则与一般私营行庄有所不同。它首先要努力完成政府赋予国家银行的特殊任务，满足国家和人民的需要。其次，根据共同纲领第三十九条的规定，它要领导监督和帮助依法营业的私人金融事业；只要私营行庄努力为生产服务，扶助正当的工商业，国家银行还可以给予必要的支持。国家银行对私营行庄应建立广泛的业务联系。在业务上，国家银行应协助私营行庄调拨资金，开展汇兑，便利城乡物资交流；遇到信用发生迟滞的时候，可以采取转存款的方式，帮助私营行庄克服困难。目前国家银行正拟举办转抵押的业务，以减少私营行庄在扶助工商业过程中的后顾之忧，在周转困难时予以通融。但私营行庄应该摒弃单纯依赖国家银行的思想，如要求国家银行给予无限制的转抵押、转存款和固定的加息等优待。私营行庄应努力改造自己，并在积极扶植工商业中，自求发展，从而取得国家银行的适当帮助。
    金融业中的劳资关系，也还应该继续进行调整。政府主管机关和工会应帮助劳资双方，进行协议。努力精简节约，改善经营，改造私营行庄在过去通货膨胀时期所形成的不合理的经营方式。使金融业机构、人员、开支等项，改变到能够适应通货稳定的新情况。我们希望在私营银钱业中的从业人员，彻底抛弃求取暴利的经营方式，同时不要强调优厚的待遇标准。过去私营行庄虚假的繁荣，对于国民经济并无好处；过去从业人员的优裕生活，也是建筑于广大人民的贫困之上，不值得留恋回忆，应该从长远的利益着想，努力逐渐改变旧的习惯。目前私营行庄从业人员的待遇，仍然远比国家银行人员的待遇为高。据华北区的调查，私营银行从业人员的待遇均比国家银行的待遇高出一倍半到三倍。这显然是不利于经营的。
    我们相信，银钱业经过调整以后，凡是认真改造自己，努力扶持正当工商业的，都将会有一定的发展与好转。银行业的存放业务，自三月以来已增加一倍，最近尚在增加之中，随着物价日趋稳定和工商业逐渐的好转，金融业本身如再经过精简节约，业务亦将继续有所发展。现在问题的关键就在于私营行庄是否愿意坚决切实进行这个改造。
    一般地说，大银行历史久、有资产，这是良好的条件；但机构臃肿，人员众多，开支庞大，如不切实进行精简节约，困难仍然是不容易克服的。中小行庄资力小，在信用迟滞时期风险较大；但是采取联营的方式，其业务情况已日趋好转；今后如能加强联营组织，进一步集中运用资金是有前途的。
    银钱业从扶植工商业及自我改造中求得好转与发展，这是全国金融业联席会议所指出的方向，我们希望私营行庄的从业人员切实进行学习研究，使之贯彻实现，以争取业务的好转。同样，国家银行的工作人员也应该研究与执行全国金融业联席会议的方针，团结私营行庄，以达到扶助正当工商业发展的目的。
