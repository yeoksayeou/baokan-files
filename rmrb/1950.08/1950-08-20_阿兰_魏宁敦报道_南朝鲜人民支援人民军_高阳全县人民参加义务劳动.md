　　South Korean People Support the People's Army
    Goyang County's Entire Population Participates in Voluntary Labor
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th dispatch] TASS, London Dispatch: Alan Winnington, special correspondent in Korea for the *Daily Worker*, reported on how the recently liberated South Korean people are assisting the People's Army. He cited the example of Goyang County in Gyeonggi Province: every man and woman in the entire county is assisting the People's Army. This county has a total of 180,000 residents, and from July 24th to August 15th, a total of 54,000 people volunteered for voluntary labor to support the People's Army. This figure does not include the regular repair teams that are automatically repairing local bombing damage, nor does it include the women mobilized by the Women's Association. If women who are too young or too old are excluded, this number approaches 100% of the county's available labor force.
    Two thousand volunteers from this county have joined the army, and an equal number are waiting to enlist.
    Similar situations can be seen in all liberated areas of South Korea.

　　南朝鲜人民支援人民军
    高阳全县人民参加义务劳动
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：《工人日报》驻朝鲜特派记者阿兰·魏宁敦报道最近解放的南朝鲜人民是怎样协助人民军的。他举了京畿道高阳县的例子：全县的每个男子和妇女都协助人民军。这一个县共有十八万居民，从七月二十四日到八月十五日，共有五万四千人志愿参加义务劳动支援人民军。这个数字并没有把自动进行修复当地轰炸损害的正规修复队计算在内，也没有包括妇女协会所动员的妇女。如果把年龄太小或太老的妇女除去不算，这数字接近全县可用人力的百分之百。
    这个县有二千名志愿兵加入了军队，尚有相等数目的人在等待入伍。
    在南朝鲜所有解放地区都可以看到类似的情况。
