    The Syngman Rhee gang, under the direct instigation of U.S. imperialism, massacres Korean patriots.
    U.S. imperialists directly instructed the Syngman Rhee gang to use the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people – the patriots – as shooting targets.
    These photos (①②) are proof of this fact.
    These photos depict the tragic scene of the Syngman Rhee gang's "National Defense Forces," under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, cruelly shooting Korean patriots.
    These photos were left behind by the "U.S. Embassy" personnel in their hasty escape due to the fierce attacks of the Korean People's Army, and were discovered in the "U.S. Embassy" files.
    The photos show how the bandits gathered the patriots together and shot them from behind.
    These were taken by "U.S. Embassy" personnel.
    The following three (③④⑤) were discovered in the homes of the so-called U.S. military advisors in the South Korean puppet government.
    The so-called National Defense Force military police, under the instructions of the U.S. military advisors, used unbearably cruel methods to shoot patriotic people, hanging targets on the patriots' hearts, and tying their necks, arms, and legs with ropes before shooting them.

    李承晚匪帮在美帝国主义直接指使下屠杀朝鲜爱国者
    美帝国主义者直接指使李承晚匪帮，将朝鲜人民的优秀儿女——爱国者，做了射击的标的。
    这些照片（①②）就是这一事实的证明。
    这些照片是受美帝国主义指使的李承晚匪帮“国防军”，残忍枪杀朝鲜爱国者的惨景。
    这些照片是由于朝鲜人民军的猛烈进攻仓惶逃走的“美国大使馆”人员所遗掉，系在“美国大使馆”文件中发现的。
    由照片中可以看出匪徒们将爱国者聚集在一起，由背面射击而枪杀。
    这是“美国大使馆”人员所摄的。
    其次三张（③④⑤）是在南朝鲜傀儡政府的所谓美国军事顾问家中发现的。
    所谓国防军宪兵受美国军事顾问的指示，以不忍目睹的残酷方法，枪杀爱国人民，在爱国者的心脏位置挂上标的，用绳子捆住颈项、手臂和腿腕然后枪杀。
