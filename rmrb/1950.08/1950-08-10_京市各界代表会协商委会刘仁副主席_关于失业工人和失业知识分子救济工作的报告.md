　　Before liberation, due to the long-term rule of imperialism and domestic reactionary forces, the social economy was in an abnormal state, creating a constant unemployment problem. Especially during the three years of Kuomintang rule after the Japanese surrender, industry and commerce were devastated. Not only were most of the industries "taken over" by the Kuomintang left in ruins, but also a quarter of private factories were in a state of shutdown or semi-shutdown. Private commerce also suffered greatly. This further increased the number of unemployed workers.

　　Since liberation, the number of unemployed workers, intellectuals, and other unemployed people has greatly decreased compared to pre-liberation times. This is because:

　　(1) Due to the recovery and development of production, and the expansion and increase of public and private industries, the industrial population has increased. According to statistics from the time of liberation to June of this year, state-owned factories have increased their employees by 18,377, and private factories have increased their employees by 12,033, for a total increase of 30,410 employees (an increase of about 50 percent). This has provided employment opportunities for a considerable number of unemployed workers. In addition, some small handicraft workers have also increased. Although there has also been a reduction of workers in some industries that do not meet the needs of the people or are excessive, they have not yet found employment. Tricycle workers have also experienced some unemployment due to the development of modern transportation such as trams and buses. But the number is small, and the vast majority have been properly resettled.

　　(2) From the perspective of commerce: all commercial activities that do not meet the needs of the people, such as selling luxury goods and superstitious items, and those that served the reactionary ruling class, have rapidly declined, thus increasing the number of unemployed shop assistants. At the same time, because Beijing is surrounded by old liberated areas, because of the development of trade between urban and rural areas after liberation, and because Beijing is the capital, all commercial activities that meet the needs of the people have developed. Therefore, the commercial population as a whole has not changed much compared to pre-liberation times. Among the unemployed shop assistants, some have returned to their hometowns, and some have found new employment. There are still some who have not yet found employment.

　　(3) From the perspective of cultural and educational undertakings: since liberation, the entire school education system has developed, especially the number of primary school and spare-time school teachers and staff has increased. In addition, revolutionary cadre schools such as the Revolutionary University and the Military and Political University, as well as the Southward Working Group, have absorbed a large number of unemployed intellectuals, trained them, and assigned them work. Within the municipal government system, with the exception of bad elements who were purged, the vast majority of the streamlined staff members have also been introduced to new jobs after training. Therefore, since liberation, the number of unemployed intellectuals has also decreased, not increased.

　　(4) Because the municipal government has taken measures such as immigration, re-employment, production for self-salvation, returning to the countryside for production, and work relief for the unemployed population, it has also solved the employment and relief problems for a considerable number of unemployed workers, intellectuals, and other unemployed people. According to extremely incomplete statistics, approximately 16,000 people have participated in production and found fundamental employment, including: 7,197 people who immigrated to the Northeast and Northwest (of whom 6,100 were workers, accounting for more than 80 percent), 397 people introduced to work in the Benxi Coal Mine in the Northeast, 1,800 workers organized to participate in production cooperatives, and 6,865 people mobilized to return to their hometowns for production. In addition, only the Sanitation Engineering Bureau has an average of more than 4,000 people participating in work relief every day. Furthermore, those who have found re-employment in the city have not been included in the calculation.

　　However, because the number of unemployed people caused by the long-term reactionary rule in the past is very large, the unemployment problem has not been completely solved. In addition, some workers and shop assistants who were dismissed after liberation have not yet found employment. In the process of continued social and economic restructuring in the future, some workers and shop assistants may also be dismissed. This problem must be solved comprehensively.

　　At the first session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, a resolution was passed on the issue of relieving unemployed workers and staff, which the municipal government implemented in February of this year. At the beginning of the implementation, some cadres in the trade union and the labor bureau did not implement it resolutely, but this was quickly corrected, and the results of the trial implementation were good. However, because the purpose of this unemployment relief method is to solve the difficulties encountered by some factories and larger workshops in the recovery and development of production in terms of the dismissal issue, so as to obtain the convenience of improving management and reducing costs, it can only solve the unemployment relief problem for workers and staff dismissed by factories and workshops with more than ten people, but cannot solve the entire unemployment problem. The fundamental solution to the unemployment problem requires a fundamental improvement in the economic situation and the completion of the national land reform, and further recovery and development of production. Only then can it be, and will it certainly be, completely solved. There is no unemployment in the Northeast now, and Beijing has added 30,000 workers in the past. This is ironclad proof. But before we fundamentally solve the problem of worker unemployment, we should have temporary measures. Chairman Mao and the Central Committee have given us clear instructions. In his report "Struggle for a Fundamental Turn for the Better in the Nation's Financial and Economic Situation," Chairman Mao clearly instructed us: "We must earnestly carry out relief work for unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals, and help the unemployed find employment step by step." To this end, the Government Administration Council issued the "Instructions on Relieving Unemployed Workers" and the "Provisional Measures for Relieving Unemployed Workers." Based on Chairman Mao's instructions and the Government Administration Council's methods for relieving unemployed workers, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Standing Committee have now formulated the following plan:

　　(1) Scope of relief: Should include unemployed workers and staff in public and private industrial and commercial enterprises and transportation undertakings, as well as unemployed personnel engaged in cultural, artistic, and educational work, both before and after liberation.

　　(2) Relief measures:

　　(1) The Labor Bureau and the trade union should adopt various methods to help the unemployed find employment. The work in this area over the past year has been very successful, and some experience has been gained. This should continue to be done.

　　(2) According to the experience of Beijing, mobilizing the unemployed population to return to their hometowns for production is also an effective way to solve the urban unemployment problem. However, some people who are accustomed to living in the city are very attached to the city and are unwilling to return to their hometowns for production. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out good propaganda and persuasion, especially to get the family members to agree, in order to mobilize them to return to their hometowns on a voluntary basis. Secondly, people who return to their hometowns for production should not only be given the necessary travel expenses and a certain amount of relief money for themselves and their families, but also should be given a certificate so that they can obtain resettlement from the local people's government after returning to their hometowns.

　　(3) Organizing unemployed workers to participate in work relief can not only solve the livelihood problems of unemployed workers and other unemployed people, but also develop various construction projects, and provide unemployed workers and other unemployed people with collective labor training and cultural and political education. This is really a win-win situation.

　　(4) Under overall planning, organize unemployed workers' production cooperatives or production groups, and provide guidance and assistance in terms of business direction, capital, technology, raw material supply, and product sales.

　　(5) The method of retraining and re-employing unemployed workers and intellectuals is successful. The municipal government and the People's Printing Factory used this method to solve the problem when dealing with surplus personnel. At the same time, in order to meet the needs of future production and cultural development, technical, cultural, and political education should be given to unemployed workers and intellectuals under possible conditions, based on the principle of voluntarism. In addition, street beggars and children should also be concentrated for education.

　　(6) Unemployed workers and intellectuals who cannot be resettled by adopting the above-mentioned relief methods should also be given relief money in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Government Administration Council.

　　In order to implement the above methods, the Municipal People's Government has established an Unemployed Workers Relief Committee.

　　As for the method of relieving unemployed workers previously decided by Beijing, the main purpose is to provide some factories and large workshops with convenient conditions for dismissing some workers in order to improve management, and at the same time, to protect the lives of these dismissed workers. After a detailed summary of the implementation experience, it will be submitted to the conference for handling separately.

　　At present, the unemployment problem in Beijing is still very serious. This is a major issue of common concern to the government and the people, and a painful historical legacy left to us by the imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule. In the future, with the development of our economy, it will certainly be gradually resolved. But before our production has a greater development, and under the conditions that our country's finances are still very difficult, we must also do everything possible to responsibly help the unemployed working people overcome their current difficulties. This is the problem we must deal with now.

### 京市各界代表会协商委会刘仁副主席  关于失业工人和失业知识分子救济工作的报告

　　京市各界代表会协商委会刘仁副主席
    关于失业工人和失业知识分子救济工作的报告
    解放以前，由于帝国主义和国内反动势力的长期统治，社会经济处于不正常状态，造成了经常的失业群。特别是日寇投降后，国民党统治的三年中间，工商凋敝。不仅被国民党“劫收”的工业，多数陷于破烂不堪，私营工厂亦有四分之一陷于停工和半停工状态。私营商业也受到很大的摧残。这样，更增加了失业工人的数量。
    解放以来，失业的工人、知识分子及其他失业人口，较之解放前大为减少了。这是因为：
    （１）由于生产的恢复和发展，公私工业的扩大和增加，工业人口增加了。根据解放以来至本年六月的统计，公营工厂增加职工一八、三七七人，私营工厂增加职工一二、○三三人，共计增加职工三○、四一○人（即增加约百分之五十），这使相当大的一部分失业工人得到了就业的机会。此外，一些小手工业工人也有增加，虽然也有一部分不合乎人民需要和过剩的行业中裁减下来的工人，还没有就业。三轮车工人也因电车、公共汽车等现代交通工具的发展，有一部分失业。但为数不大，而且绝大多数都得到了适当的安置。
    （２）从商业方面来看：凡是不合于人民需要的，如贩卖奢侈品、迷信品的，曾为反动统治阶级服务的商业，都迅速衰落了，因此，增加了一部分失业的店员。同时，由于北京市周围是老解放区，由于解放后城乡贸易的开展，由于北京是首都，故凡是合乎人民需要的商业都发展了，因而商业人口在总的方面与解放前并无多大变化。失业店员中，一部分回乡了，一部分重新就业了，现在还有一部分没有就业。
    （３）从文化教育事业方面来看：解放以后，整个学校教育发展了，特别是小学和业余学校教职员都增加了。此外，革大、军大等革命干部学校和南下工作团，又吸收了很大数量的失业知识分子，加以训练，分配了工作。在市人民政府系统下除清洗的坏分子外，其余精简的工作人员，经过训练后，绝大多数也都介绍了新的工作。因此，解放以来，失业知识分子的数目也是减少了，不是增加了。
    （４）由于市人民政府对于失业人口采取了移民、转业、生产自救和还乡生产、以工代赈等项措施，又解决了相当数量的失业工人，知识分子及其他失业人口的就业和救济问题，根据极不完全的材料统计，参加生产，根本就业的约一万六千余人，计：移民东北和西北七、一九七人（其中工人六、一○○人、占百分之八十以上），介绍去东北本溪煤矿工作者三九七人，组织参加生产合作社工人一、八○○人，动员回乡生产者六、八六五人。另外，参加以工代赈的人，仅卫生工程局平均每日就有四千余人。此外，在本市转业就业者，尚未计算在内。
    但是因为过去长期的反动统治所造成的失业人口的数量很大，因此，失业问题还没有获得完全解决。加以解放后被解雇的工人、店员，也还有一部分没有就业。在今后社会经济继续改组过程中，还可能有一部分工人、店员被解雇。这个问题，必须通盘解决。
    在本市第二届第一次各界人民代表会议上，曾经通过了关于救济失业员工问题的决议，市人民政府已于本年二月执行。在开始执行时，工会和劳动局部分干部，执行得很不坚决，旋即纠正，试行的结果也是好的。但因为这种失业救济办法的目的，是为了解决一部分工厂和较大的作坊在恢复与发展生产中所遇到的解雇问题上的困难，使其能够取得改善经营、减低成本的便利条件，所以只能解决十人以上工厂、作坊所解雇职工的失业救济问题，而不能解决整个失业问题。失业问题的根本解决，需要经济情况的根本好转，需要全国土地改革的完成，生产的进一步恢复与发展，那时才可能，也一定能完全解决。现在东北已经没有失业的了，本市过去已增加了三万工人，这就是铁证。但我们在根本解决工人失业问题前，应该有临时措施。毛主席和中央已给了我们明确的指示。毛主席在“为争取国家财政经济状况的基本好转而斗争”的报告中，曾明确指示我们：“必须认真地进行对失业工人和失业知识分子的救济工作，有步骤地帮助失业者就业。”政务院为此，曾颁布了“关于救济失业工人的指示”和“救济失业工人的暂行办法”。根据毛主席的指示和政务院救济失业工人的办法，现在北京市人民政府和协商委员会特拟定了以下的方案：
    （一）救济范围：应当包括解放前后在公私营工商企业与运输事业中的失业工人和职员，以及从事文化艺术教育工作的失业人员。
    （二）救济办法：
    （１）劳动局和工会应采用各种方法，帮助失业者就业。过去一年来在这一方面的工作是有很大成绩的，并且已经取得了一些经验，应该继续这样做。
    （２）根据本市的经验证明，动员失业人口还乡生产也是一个解决城市失业问题的有效办法。但惯居城市的人有一部分是很留恋城市的，不愿回乡生产，因此，必须经过很好的宣传说服，尤其要打通其家属的思想，才能在自愿的原则下，动员他们还乡。其次，对还乡生产的人，不仅要发给本人及其家属以必需的旅费及一定数目的救济金，还应发给证明文件，使他们在还乡之后，能够取得当地人民政府的安置。
    （３）组织失业工人参加工赈，不仅可以解决失业工人和其他失业人口的生活问题，而且可以发展各项建设事业，并给予失业工人和其他失业人口以集体劳动的训练和文化政治的教育，实在是一举两得。
    （４）要在通盘筹划之下，组织失业工人的生产合作社或生产小组，并给以经营方向、资金、技术、原料供给和产品推销的指导和帮助。
    （５）对失业的工人和知识分子采取先训练后转业的办法，是成功的。市人民政府和人民印刷厂在处理编余人员时，都用这样的办法解决了问题。同时，为了适应将来生产和文化事业发展的需要，应在可能条件下对于失业工人和知识分子，根据自愿原则，给以技术的、文化的、政治的教育。此外，对于街头乞讨儿童，亦予以集中教养。
    （６）对于采用上述救济办法，仍不能安置的失业工人和知识分子，亦应按政务院规定的办法，发给救济金。
    为了执行以上的办法，已由市人民政府成立失业工人救济委员会。
    至于本市前所决定的救济失业工人办法，主要的目的，是给一些工厂和大作坊为了改善经营而解雇一部分工人以便利条件，同时，保障这些被解雇的工人的生活，待将实施经验详细总结后，另提大会处理。
    目前本市失业的问题，还是很严重的，这是政府和人民一致关心的一个重大问题，是帝国主义和国民党反动统治所留给我们一个痛苦的历史遗产。今后随着我们经济的发展，是一定能够逐渐解决的。但在我们的生产还没有更大的发展以前，在我们国家的财政还是十分困难的条件下，我们也要竭尽一切可能，负责地帮助失业的劳动人民度过目前的困难，这就是我们现在所要处理的问题。
