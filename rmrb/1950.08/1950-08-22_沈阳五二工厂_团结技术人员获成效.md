Shenyang No. 52 Factory
Achieves Success in Uniting Technical Personnel

[This News Report] According to the Northeast Daily, the Shenyang No. 52 Factory has achieved remarkable results in uniting technical personnel and staff. Technical personnel in the factory have shifted from passively sitting in the office waiting for work assignments to actively going into practice to find work to do. Work efficiency has been significantly improved, and ideological understanding has also taken a step forward. The factory's successful experiences: (1) It implemented the Northeast Bureau's instructions on uniting technical personnel and staff, further clarifying that "technical personnel and staff are part of the working class." Therefore, from the factory's leading cadres to general cadres, the policy of uniting, educating, winning over, and transforming technical personnel and staff is clear. The Party has designated this work as the main task of the Party, correcting the tendency of closed-doorism. (2) It boldly uses technical personnel and staff, giving them responsibility and authority, and providing them with assistance in both ideological and practical work. The slogans "combining theory with practice" and "combining technical personnel with workers" are put forward. Technical personnel are praised for their achievements in work, and are given appropriate education and criticism for poor work. After rewarding a group of technical personnel and staff in March, it played a significant role in promoting production. (3) Providing appropriate opportunities to participate in political activities strengthens their sense of ownership. Representative figures are absorbed to participate in the factory management committee as representatives or attend meetings as nonvoting delegates, and their correct opinions are accepted. They are also often absorbed to participate in various meetings for arranging and summarizing work. (4) Organizing theoretical study. In studying the history of social development, they theoretically understood the principles of the labor viewpoint and the mass viewpoint. Studying On People's Democratic Dictatorship, the Common Program, and Political Economy, and organizing meetings for ideological education of cadres, they are also absorbed to participate, giving practical education. (5) Correctly resolving the relationship between veteran cadres and technical personnel and staff. Experience shows that whenever the relationship between veteran cadres and technical personnel and staff is properly resolved, the enthusiasm of technical personnel and staff is improved. The current problem is that the atmosphere of veteran cadres actively learning professional skills from technical personnel and staff is not strong enough. (6) Correctly resolving the relationship between workers and technical personnel and staff. Technical personnel and staff have initially established the labor viewpoint and the mass viewpoint, going into practice and combining with workers, changing the view of underestimating workers and looking down on workers' creativity. The workers are more willing to approach them. A worker, Xie Guangxuan, is very popular with workers, because engineer Xie can combine with workers, learn from workers, and guide workers' technology. When implementing the policy of "uniting technical personnel," we should also educate and correct some workers' views such as "engineers are not as good as workers." The leadership should patiently explain that technical personnel and staff each have their own strengths and their own roles; only when technical personnel and workers combine, with workers first accepting the technical guidance of technical personnel, and technical personnel also learning from workers' practical experience, can the work be done well. The above points are based on the implementation of policies, and are complemented by ideological education and the resolution of cadre relations and employee relations. Our experience is that after the above problems are correctly resolved, the work of technical personnel and staff will have a new transformation and a new atmosphere will emerge.

　　沈阳五二工厂
    团结技术人员获成效
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：沈阳五二工厂团结技术人员和职员，获得显著成效。该厂技术人员由被动地坐办公室等待分配工作，转变为主动的深入实际找工作做，工作效率显著提高，思想认识也提高了一步。该厂的成功经验：（一）执行了东北局关于团结技术人员与职员的指示，进一步明确了“技术人员与职员是工人阶级的一部分”，因此从厂的领导干部到一般干部对团结、教育、争取、改造技术人员与职员的方针是明确的，在党内并把这一工作定为党的主要工作，纠正了关门主义偏向。（二）大胆使用，使技术人员与职员有责有权，在思想和实际工作中都给他们帮助，提出“理论与实际结合”“技术人员与工人结合”的口号，技术人员工作有成绩就表扬，工作不好就给以适当的教育批评。三月份奖励了一批技术人员与职员后，对推动生产起了很大作用。（三）给予适当的参加政治活动的机会，加强其主人翁感觉，吸收其代表人物参加工厂管理委员会为代表或列席，接受他们的正确意见，并经常吸收他们参加各种布置工作和总结工作的会议。（四）组织理论学习。在学习社会发展史中，他们从理论上懂得了劳动观点和群众观点的道理；学习论人民民主专政，共同纲领
  政治经济学，又组织干部思想教育的会议，也吸收他们参加，给予实际教育。（五）正确的解决了老干部与技术人员、职员的关系问题。经验说明，凡是老干部与技术人员、职员的关系得到适当解决，技术人员与职员的积极性就提高。目前存在的问题，是老干部积极向技术人员和职员学习业务的空气还不够浓厚。（六）正确的解决工人和技术人员、职员的关系。技术人员与职员初步建立了劳动观点和群众观点，深入实际与工人结合，改变了轻视工人和看不起工人创造性的观点，工人们更加愿意和他们接近。一所工人非常欢迎谢光选工程师，因为谢工程师能和工人结合，向工人学习，又能指点工人的技术。在执行“团结技术人员”政策时，也应教育与纠正某些工人中“工程师不如工人”等看法，领导上应耐心说明技术人员和职员各有其长处，各有其作用；只有技术人员和工人结合，工人首先接受技术人员的技术指导，技术人员也学习工人的实际经验，工作才能搞的好。以上各点，是以执行政策为主，并与思想教育和解决干部关系、职工关系等相辅而行的。我们的经验，以上问题正确解决后，技术人员与职员的工作便有了新的转变，出现了新的气象。
