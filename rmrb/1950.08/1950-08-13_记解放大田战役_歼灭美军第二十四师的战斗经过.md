　　The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops’ so-called “counter-offensive line” of the Geum River-Daejeon defense line finally collapsed under the raging onslaught of the Korean People's Army. At six o'clock in the afternoon on July 20th, over the smoky, blood-soaked ruins of Daejeon, the flag of the People's Republic began to flutter. This banner, symbolizing the victory of the Korean people, was planted amidst shouts of “hurrah” by the soldiers of the combined arms units (Seoul 4th Division) of Li Quanwu (transliteration) and the Song Dewan (transliteration, same below) units, after they broke into the inferno that was Daejeon.

　　In breaking through the four-kilometer-wide and twenty-five-kilometer-long Geum River defense line, the Song Dewan unit, crossing the Geum River from a point southwest of Daejeon, not only cut off the enemy's retreat from Daejeon to Geumsan and Daegu, but also performed great meritorious service in a large-scale annihilation battle, being the first to break into Daejeon and engage in hand-to-hand combat.

　　The enemy forcibly mobilized more than 20,000 people, dug countless trenches like honeycombs on the left bank of the Geum River, and constructed solid fortifications. The preliminary battles began; without a swift crossing of the Geum River, it would be impossible to attack Daejeon. The artillery battle, unfolding along the river, continued day and night, the flames illuminating the river's surface, shells constantly flashing. Within every quarter of an hour, thousands of cannons roared, day and night, the sea of fire and towering dust of explosions filling the surrounding area.

　　Taking advantage of the night fog, the soldiers of the Song Dewan unit broke through the enemy's crossfire network near Mount Baowu (transliteration), four kilometers upstream from Gongju, and began to cross the river. The soldiers used boats, rafts, or walked, approaching the cut-off points of the defense line. Our soldiers crossed over corpses and the blood-red river, broke into the riverbank, and charged through the cut-off points of the defense line. In this way, the Song Dewan unit penetrated deep into the enemy's rear.

　　Our troops continued to break through the enemy's defense line, either flanking or crossing the river; the enemy's bombing and machine-gun strafing, and illuminating flares could not stop our advance.

　　A portion of our People's Army liberated the historically significant city of Gongju on the 15th.

　　Before the liberation of Gongju, the Song Dewan unit clashed with enemy reinforcement troops at the river crossing point, encircling and annihilating more than one hundred enemies. By this time, the enemy confirmed that the People's Army had crossed the river, abandoned part of their positions, and frantically carried out artillery fire and bombing while retreating. But our troops swept away the enemy from the river crossing point and advanced all the way to Daejeon.

　　The Song Dewan unit’s lightning-fast liberation of Nonsan terrified the enemy in the preliminary battles on all fronts of Daejeon. The soldiers forcibly marched, following the mountain peaks, from high ground to high ground, and began the siege of Daejeon.

　　Every time they reached a gorge, they were subjected to concentrated enemy fire, but the Song Dewan unit penetrated deep into the enemy's rear and, on the night of the 19th, reached the high ground that could completely cut off the U.S. military's retreat route on the Geumsan-Daegu road. In this way, Daejeon was completely sealed off by our iron pincers. The pincers were shrinking every moment, spending hours before the charge in the midst of fire and soaring smoke.

　　Before the street fighting began, a fierce artillery battle was launched to cover the infantry's advance. Squad Leader Cui Ruhuo (transliteration) of the ×× unit gloriously sacrificed himself in this battle. Before his sacrifice, he said to the soldiers: "You must avenge me. I believe in your victory. I will always be with your righteous advance..." These words inspired the same confidence in every soldier, and the fierce bayonet charge to wipe out the enemy began.

　　At one o'clock in the morning on the 20th, the soldiers of the Song Dewan unit and the Li Dongbai (transliteration) detachment received the order to "Charge, advance!" The soldiers shouted hurrah and broke into the city. The enemy desperately fired all their light and heavy machine guns, 47mm mortars, and 155mm cannons at the charging soldiers. Rocket launchers and howitzers also opened fire.

　　Our soldiers broke through every street defense line and advanced bravely. Every time they shouted hurrah, the enemy's positions were broken down, mixed with the ugly cries of U.S. soldiers falling after being shot.

　　The sound of shouting hurrah also shook near the airport.

　　The Song Dewan unit and the Li Dongbai detachment launched fierce bayonet combat at every intersection from Daejeon Station.

　　The enemy set fire to the streets and then began to retreat, retreating towards the Geumsan road in jeeps or various artillery vehicles. The commander of the U.S. 24th Division, Dean, fled in terror.

　　The Li Dongbai detachment continued to pursue the enemy.

　　The sound of the tank guns and the majestic sound of the tank treads further boosted the morale of the soldiers. From the direction of Longfang Mountain (transliteration) high ground in the northeast, the cheers of hurrah from our army were also heard.

　　During the street fighting, a seventeen-year-old young soldier stabbed sixteen enemies to death before collapsing from exhaustion, but he immediately struggled to stand up and chase after the enemy again. All bayonets and gun muzzles closely followed the retreating enemy.

　　Our follow-up troops continued to launch a mopping-up operation in Daejeon, and the enemy collapsed and retreated to the cut-off point on the Geumsan Road. The Song Dewan unit and the Park Weishan (transliteration) detachment concentrated their firepower here to intercept the enemy.

　　The U.S. military, caught in a pincer attack on the Geumsan Highway, fled towards the Daegu Highway. However, a portion of the Song Dewan unit was also on the Daegu Highway, intercepting the enemy at the road cut-off point. The enemy was completely surrounded in a valley.

　　In this way, a large annihilation battle against the enemy's armed forces was launched. The sound of cannons had stopped, and intense hand-to-hand combat unfolded.

　　Day was breaking a little, without clouds. The two highways in the gorge were filled with various vehicles. The enemy was also stabbed to death in the vehicles. A nineteen-year-old soldier wrestled with two U.S. soldiers on a truck, throwing both to the ground.

　　The brave shouts of our soldiers, the screams of the enemy, and the metal sounds of enemy fighter planes and the roar of various firepower intertwined into one. Because of the hand-to-hand combat between the enemy and us, even the enemy's fighter planes could not strafe. The enemy tank reinforcement troops coming from the Daegu side also fled back in panic halfway.

　　In the bayonet battles on the two highways, the Sun Jiushi (transliteration) company and the Jin Haojian (transliteration) company used up all their bullets and seized enemy weapons to wipe out the enemy. The gun barrels of the machine guns were bent due to excessive firing.

　　The final mopping-up battle was even more intense. Even hand grenades were thrown at each other. The enemy fled in panic into the mountains, and we continued to pursue and mop up the enemy. The people who had taken refuge in the mountains actively helped us carry the wounded soldiers, food, ammunition, etc.

　　The beastly U.S. military finally exposed its nature, using the people who had taken refuge as trenches, and resting the butt of the gun on the people's shoulders to fight back. The soldiers stopped shooting and approached the enemy's gun muzzle barehanded, throwing the enemy to the ground and hitting the enemy with the butt of the gun. The people also joined the fight and captured the enemy alive.

　　The enemy was completely surrounded and annihilated by us. This battle became the burial place for Dean, the commander of the U.S. 24th Division, and his subordinates. The division's military flag was also captured, and the brigade commander and Dean's concubine were also captured alive.

　　At six o'clock in the afternoon, on the high ground overlooking the two highways of Geumsan and Daegu from Daejeon, the cheers of victory, "hurrah," were transmitted to the world.

　　Hundreds of vehicles, artillery vehicles, and thousands of U.S. military corpses were scattered throughout the gorge.

　　The soldiers of the Song Dewan unit were the first to charge into Daejeon, killing and wounding nearly 1,500 enemies, and planted the flag of the Republic everywhere. From six o'clock in the afternoon, they turned to search operations.

　　记解放大田战役
    ——歼灭美军第二十四师的战斗经过
    平壤《民主朝鲜》特派记者  金永龙
    美帝国主义侵略军队号称“反攻线”的锦江—大田防线，在朝鲜人民军怒涛般的猛攻之下终于崩溃了。七月二十日下午六时在硝烟笼罩着的血腥的大田市废墟上，开始飘扬人民共和国的国旗。这象征着朝鲜人民胜利的旗帜是李权武（译音）各兵种联合部队（汉城第四师团）和宋德万（译音，下同）部队的将士们突入了火海般的大田市之后，在高喊万岁声中插上的。
    在突破宽四公里长达二十五公里的锦江防线时，宋德万部队，从大田西南地点渡过锦江，不但截断敌人从大田到锦山、大邱的退路，并且在大规模歼灭战中立了大功，首先突入了大田市，展开白刃战。
    敌人强迫动员了两万多人民，在锦江左岸像蜂窝一般挖了无数的战壕，构筑了坚固要塞。前哨战开始了，假如不迅速渡锦江就无法攻入大田市。夹着河展开的炮击战，不分昼夜继续着，火焰照红了江面，炮弹不断在闪击。每一刻钟之内数千门的炮在咆哮，不分昼夜，火海与耸天的炮尘弥漫着附近一带。
    宋德万部队将士们趁着下夜雾时，在公州上流四公里地点宝物山（译音）附近，突破了敌人的十字形火网开始渡河了。战士们用船、筏、或者步行向防线的切断处迫近。我们的战士们跨过尸体越过血红的河流，突入里岸，冲过防线的切断处，宋德万部队就这样深入了敌人防线的后方。
    我们的部队继续突破敌人的防线，或是迂回渡河，敌机的轰炸与机枪扫射，照明弹都不能阻挡我们的进击。
    我人民军的一部兵力在十五日解放了有历史意义的城市公州。
    解放公州之前宋德万部队，在渡河点与敌援兵部队交锋，包围歼灭了敌人一百多名，至此时，敌人才确认人民军已经渡河，放弃了一部分阵地，一面败退一面疯狂地进行着炮击与轰炸。但我部队就从渡河地点扫荡敌人，向大田一路进击。
    宋德万部队闪电式的解放了论山后，在大田各前线前哨战中吓倒了敌人。战士们强行进军，顺着山峰，从高地到高地，开始对大田的围攻。
    每到山峡地带，就受敌人火力的集中攻击，但宋德万部队却深入敌人后方，十九日夜到达了能完全截断美军退路的金山大邱道路的高地。这样大田完全被我们的铁钳所封锁了。铁钳时时刻刻在缩小，在火和炮烟冲天中度过了冲锋前的几小时。
    巷战开始之前，展开了猛烈的炮战，掩护步兵前进，××部队小队长崔如忽（译音）就在这次战斗中壮烈牺牲了，他在牺牲前对战士们说：“你们一定要替我报仇，我相信你们的胜利，我永远与你们正义的前进在一起……”这句话鼓舞了每一个战士的同样信心，扫荡敌人的炽烈白刃战开始了。
    二十日上午一时，宋德万部队与李东白（译音）区分队的将士们接到了“冲锋、前进！”的命令。战士们高喊着万岁突入了市区。敌人以所有的轻重机枪、四七公厘迫击炮，一五五公厘炮来向冲锋的战士拼命射击，火箭炮、榴弹炮也开了火。
    我们的战士突破了每一巷的防线，勇敢的前进，每当高喊万岁时，敌人的阵地接着被冲溃，夹杂着被枪击而倒下去的美军丑恶的叫声。
    飞机场附近也震动了高喊万岁的声音。
    宋德万部队和李东白区分队，从大田车站起，在每一个十字路口展开了炽烈的刺刀战。
    敌人在街上纵火后即开始退却，用吉普或各种炮车向着金山道路退却。美军第二十四师师长迪安魂飞魄散地逃掉了。
    李东白区分队继续追击敌人。
    坦克部队的坦克炮的声音和轮带的雄壮声音更鼓舞了战士们的士气。从东北方向龙方山（译音）高地方面也传来了我军的万岁呼声。
    在巷战当中，十七岁的少年战士刺死了十六个敌人后力尽而倒下去，但马上又挣扎着站起来追击敌人去了。所有的刺刀与枪口紧跟着退却的敌人。
    我们的后续部队继续在大田市展开扫荡战，敌人溃不成军的向锦山路上的切断地点退却。宋德万部队与朴伟善（译音）区分队在此地集中火力邀击敌人。
    在锦山公路上受夹击的美军，一部向大邱公路溃逃。但在大邱公路上也有宋德万部队的一部兵力，在公路切断地点上迎击了敌人，敌人在一个山谷里完全被包围了。
    这样展开了对敌人武装的一个大歼灭战。炮声已停止，强烈的肉搏展开了。
    天亮了一点，没有云彩，山峡的两条公路上，挤满了各种车辆。在车上也刺死了敌人。有一个十九岁的战士在卡车上与两个美军摔角，把两个都摔到地上去了。
    我们战士的勇敢喊声、敌人的悲鸣与敌人驱逐机的金属声音和各种火力的吼声，交织成一片。由于敌我进行的肉搏战，连敌人的驱逐机都无法扫射。从大邱方面来的敌坦克增援部队也在半途上惊惶失措地往回逃跑了。
    在两条公路上的白刃战中，孙久石（译音）中队与金镐剑（译音）中队用尽了子弹，缴获了敌人的武器来扫荡敌人。机枪的枪身由于过度的射击而烧弯了。
    最后的扫荡战更激烈。甚至用手榴弹互相投掷，敌人仓惶逃入山中，我们继续追击扫荡敌人。避难到山中的人民积极地帮助我们搬运伤兵、粮食、弹药等。
    兽性的美军终于暴露了它的本质，把避难的人民当做战壕，把枪托在人民的肩膀上应战。战士们停止射击，徒手向敌人枪口迫近，把敌人摔到地上以枪托打了敌人，人民也参加搏斗，活捉了敌人。
    敌人完全被我们包围歼灭了。这次战斗成了美军第二十四师师长迪安与其属下美军的葬身处。师军旗也被俘获，旅长与迪安的妾也被活捉。
    下午六时，从可以了望到大田的锦山、大邱两条公路的高地上，向全世界传出了胜利的万岁欢呼声。
    数百辆汽车，炮车和千余美军尸体布满了山峡。
    宋德万部队将士们首先冲入大田，毙伤将近一千五百名敌人，到处插上了共和国国旗。从下午六时起转入搜索战。
