People's Liberation Army, North China Military Region, Special Class Meritorious Person, Li Guoying

Editor's Note: Comrade Li Guoying was a special class meritorious person in the Cang County battle in June 1947 and is currently the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the North China Military Region. He is one of the representatives of the People's Liberation Army at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. In March of this year, our country sent a youth delegation abroad, and Comrade Li Guoying was sent as a representative of the troops. After going abroad, he participated in the Hungarian celebration of the 5th anniversary of liberation, the Czech commemoration of the "May 1st" celebration and the 5th anniversary of liberation, as well as the All-German Youth Conference held in Berlin. This article is Comrade Li Guoying's broadcast script for the Central People's Broadcasting Station on July 31st in celebration of the "August 1st" Army Day.

Fellow compatriots, comrades: In March of this year, I represented the youth of the troops and joined the Chinese Youth Delegation to go abroad. I participated in the German National Youth Conference, the Hungarian celebration of the 5th anniversary of liberation, the Czech "May 1st" Labor Day commemoration, and the Czech celebration of the 5th anniversary of liberation. I also visited some economic and cultural constructions in Moscow and the new democratic countries of Eastern Europe. Now that we have returned to our motherland, we are just in time for the 23rd anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. On such a great festival, I think it is very meaningful to introduce to you the powerful forces of the world's people in defending peace that I have seen.

  A Review of the Strength of the Hungarian and Czech People
　　On March 13th, our delegation departed from Beijing. On April 4th, we participated in the celebration of the 5th anniversary of Hungary's liberation in the capital. At the meeting, Prime Minister Rakosi made a report, thanking the great Soviet Red Army for liberating the Hungarian people five years ago. After the meeting, a large parade of 700,000 people was held. In the parade, we saw the high enthusiasm of the Hungarian people in opposing aggression and defending world peace. The Hungarian armed forces participating in the parade included the army, air force, navy, and parachute troops, all of which were motorized equipment. The grand parade continued for eight hours, and the people's emotions were always very enthusiastic.

　　On May 1st, we participated in the 300,000-person "May 1st" parade in the Czech capital. Then, on May 7th, we participated in the celebration of the 5th anniversary of Czech liberation and a grand parade of more than one million people. In the parade, we saw the same strong emotions of opposing aggressive war and supporting world peace as the Hungarian people. At the same time, we saw better armaments. Czech industry is very developed, and their troops are also particularly well-equipped. We saw that the cannons on their tanks were as big as howitzers, their mortars were also pulled by cars, and their rifles also had a special device.

  The Brave German Democratic Youth
　　On May 28th, we participated in the All-German Youth Conference and a 700,000-youth parade in Berlin. These youths came to Berlin from various provinces of East Germany. 28,000 youths from West Germany and West Berlin under the rule of US, British and French imperialism also came to participate in this grand parade. It was originally estimated that 15,000 people could come from West Germany, but 25,000 came; it was estimated that 1,000 people could come from West Berlin, but the result was 3,000. The imperialists established layers of blockades, attempting to prevent West German youth from participating in the conference, but they could not stop them. The 28,000 youths from West Germany still came completely.

　　The Berlin 700,000-youth parade continued for nine hours. President Pieck of the German Democratic Republic, who was over 70 years old, also stood solemnly for more than nine hours, reviewing this magnificent youth team, reviewing the strength of the German people. It was raining that day, but President Pieck remained motionless; and the marching crowd below were always enthusiastically shouting slogans such as defending world peace, demanding the unification of Germany, and long live Stalin, long live Mao Zedong, etc. At night, each person in the marching crowd held up a torch, and 700,000 torches illuminated the entire city of Berlin. This magnificent manifestation of the great power of the people is truly indescribable in words. And we fully saw the German people's firm will to demand peace and demand unification. On the other hand, we also saw the imperialists' panicked ugliness. On that day, the imperialist rulers of West Berlin spread rumors saying that the East German youth were going to rush into West Berlin. So they deployed many tanks and artillery on the border of West Berlin, as if a battle was about to break out. Here we saw how the nervously weak imperialists feared the awakened people and used rumors to deceive the people under their rule.

  The Economic Construction of People's Democratic Countries is Flourishing, and People's Lives are Prosperous
　　In Hungary and Czechoslovakia, we visited their industrial construction and the achievements in healing the wounds of war and restoring national construction. We visited the power plant and steel plant in Hungary, and the steel plant, automobile factory, and shoe factory in Czechoslovakia, and received a warm welcome from the workers, and saw their advanced industry. The industry of Czechoslovakia has already accounted for more than 70% of the entire national economy. We saw the workers' dormitories in the Czech factory, each five-story building can house 90 families of workers, and the equipment inside is almost completely mechanized and electrified. The workers' clothes are washed by machine and ironed dry by electricity. When the female workers go to work, they send their children to the nursery, and the equipment in the nursery is also very good, and the children's club has all kinds of toys. We can say that the lives of the children of Czech workers are also very comfortable. Like adults, they enjoy the civilized life under the highly developed industrial construction. In Hungary, we visited a rural cooperative, and they used machines to cultivate the land completely. Each cultivation machine can cultivate 140 mu of land per day. We visited a village called Nizicai. This small village was completely destroyed by the German fascists in the past, but now a better new village has been rebuilt, and the facilities are also very good. The lives of the villagers are almost completely electrified. In Czechoslovakia, we saw a construction team of thousands of young men and women, and a very long railway was completely built by them. Here, we see that, under the help of the Soviet Union and the mutual assistance between the Eastern European countries, especially with the concerted efforts of their people, in the short five years after the war, the construction of these new democratic countries in Eastern Europe has achieved great results.

  The Victorious Chinese People are Welcomed and Respected Everywhere
　　During the few months we were abroad, we deeply felt the significance of the victory of the Chinese people in consolidating world peace. The situation where we Chinese people were welcomed and respected so warmly everywhere has never happened before. On every occasion, our Chinese delegation was cheered and surrounded. Wherever we went, we could hear people shouting "Long live the Chinese people!" and "Long live Mao Zedong!" In many places, people rushed to shake hands with us, ask us to sign autographs, and ask us to speak. In the capital of Czechoslovakia, the youth blocked our car, picked us up from the car, and lifted us high into the air. They paraded on the busiest streets, and people lifted us up like crazy, shouting Mao Zedong and crowding around us. When we went to Berlin, the German people organized a 400-mile-long welcoming line. Along the way, we were welcomed everywhere. While advancing towards Berlin, we also participated in five grand welcoming meetings. During the 700,000-youth parade in Berlin, we could not only see Chairman Mao's portraits everywhere and hear slogans celebrating the victory of the Chinese people and consolidating the solidarity of the Chinese and German people, but they also organized a Mao Zedong team of 700-800 people, holding Chairman Mao's portraits completely and shouting slogans enthusiastically. When they discovered our Chinese representatives, they were even more fanatical. In the marching crowd, in youth and children's activities, and in the economic construction team, we could hear the name of the Mao Zedong team everywhere. The victory of our 475 million Chinese people vigorously assists the peace cause of the world's people, and at the same time, the struggle of the great world's people also consolidates the victory of our Chinese people.

  Oppose American Aggression Crimes, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan!
　　Now, our Chinese delegation has returned, and we are excited to come back to participate in today's celebration of the founding of our People's Liberation Army. I am a revolutionary soldier. I have actively participated in the heroic struggle of the Chinese people's revolutionary cause. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of our country have gone through arduous and heroic struggles, and we have finally achieved today's victory. Now, American imperialism and its accomplices have launched a war of aggression against the Korean people, sent a fleet to our Taiwan, attempting to prevent us from liberating it, and using various conspiracies to step up the aggression and enslavement of the people of various countries in the East. The peace-loving people of the world firmly oppose this evil action of American imperialism, and we, the Chinese people and all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, will unite and strengthen preparations to give them a crushing blow at any time. The Chinese people are like a giant, no matter how crazy the imperialists are, Taiwan must be liberated, the Korean people will surely achieve final victory, and any conspiracy of aggression can only accelerate the death of the aggressors themselves.

　　我看到了世界人民的强大力量
    人民解放军华北军区某部特等功臣  李国英
    编者按：李国英同志是一九四七年六月沧县战斗中的特等功臣，现任华北军区某部三营营长。中国人民政治协商会议解放军代表之一。今年三月，我国派遣青年代表团出国，李国英同志被派为部队代表。出国后，参加了匈牙利庆祝解放五周年大会，捷克纪念“五一”大会和庆祝解放五周年大会，以及在柏林举行的全德青年大会。这篇文章，是李国英同志为庆祝“八一”建军节，于七月三十一日在中央人民广播电台的广播稿。
    各位同胞，各位同志：今年三月我代表部队青年参加中国青年代表团出国，参加了德国全国青年大会，参加了匈牙利庆祝解放五周年的大会，参加了捷克的”五一“劳动节纪念大会和捷克解放五周年大会，并且参观莫斯科和东欧新民主主义国家的一些经济和文化的建设。现在我们又回到祖国，刚好逢到我们中国人民解放军的建军二十三周年纪念日，在这样一个伟大的节日，我来向大家介绍一下我所看到的世界人民保卫和平的强大力量，我想是很有意义的。
  匈牙利、捷克人民力量的检阅
    三月十三号，我们代表团从北京起身。四月四号，我们参加了匈牙利首都庆祝解放五周年的大会。会上由拉科西总理作了报告，感谢伟大的苏联红军在五年前解放了匈牙利人民，会后举行了七十万人的大游行。在游行的行列中，我们看到了匈牙利人民反对侵略保卫世界和平的很高的热情。参加游行的匈牙利武装部队，有陆军，有空军，有海军，还有降落伞部队，这一切都是摩托化的装备。大游行继续了八个钟头，而人们的情绪始终是非常热烈的。
    五月一号，我们参加了捷克首都的三十万人的“五一”大游行。接着，五月七号，我们又参加了庆祝捷克解放五周年的大会和一百多万人的大游行。在游行中间，我们看到了同匈牙利人民同样的那种反对侵略战争，拥护世界和平强烈的情绪。同时，我们看到了更好的武装，捷克的工业是非常发达的，他们部队的装备也特别好。我们看到他们坦克车上的大炮就有榴弹炮那么大，他们迫击炮也是用汽车拉着，他们的步枪上也有一种特殊的装置。
  英勇的德国民主青年们
    五月二十八号，我们在柏林参加了全德青年大会和七十万青年大游行。这些青年是由东德各省来到柏林的，美英法帝国主义统治下的西德和西柏林的二万八千名青年也来参加了这个大游行。原来估计西德能来一万五千人，他们却来了二万五千；估计西柏林能来一千人，结果却来了三千人。帝国主义建立了层层的封锁线，企图阻止西德青年参加大会，但他们是无法阻挡的，西德的二万八千名青年还是完全过来了。
    柏林的七十万青年大游行，一直继续了九个钟头，七十多岁的德意志人民共和国皮克总统也庄严的一直站了九个多钟头，检阅着这个雄壮的青年的队伍，检阅着德国人民的力量。那一天下着雨，但皮克总统却一动也不动；而下面游行的队伍也永远在热狂的喊着保卫世界和平，要求统一德国的口号和斯大林万岁毛泽东万岁等等的口号。到了夜里，游行的队伍每人都高举起一个火把，七十万火把照耀红了整个的柏林城。这种壮观的伟大的人民力量的表现，真是不能用语言文字形容出来的。而德国人民要求和平、要求统一的坚强意志我们就完全看到了。另一方面，我们也看到了帝国主义的惊慌的丑态，那一天，西柏林的帝国主义统治者造谣说：东德的青年要冲到西柏林来了。于是他们在西柏林的边界上布置了许多坦克和大炮，好象就要发生战斗的样子。在这里我们看到了神经脆弱的帝国主义者，是怎样惧怕觉悟了的人民，而且用造谣来欺骗他们统治下的人民。
  人民民主国家经济建设蓬勃发展，人民生活富裕
    我们在匈牙利和捷克参观了他们的工业建设和医治战争创伤恢复国家建设的成就。我们参观了匈牙利的发电厂和制钢厂，参观了捷克的制钢厂、汽车工厂和皮鞋工厂等，受到了工人们的热烈欢迎，看到了他们的先进工业。捷克的工业已经占了全部国民经济的百分之七十以上。我们看到了捷克工厂的工人宿舍，每一座五层楼，可以住九十家工人，里边的设备差不多完全是机械化电气化的，工人的衣服都是用机器洗，用电气熨干的。女工们上工时，就把孩子交到托儿所里，托儿所的设备也是非常好的，儿童俱乐部的玩具什么都有。我们可以说，捷克工人子弟的生活也是非常舒服的，他们和大人一样，享受到了工业建设高度发展下的文明生活。我们在匈牙利参观了一个农村合作社，他们是完全用机器耕种土地的，每架耕种机一天可以耕地一百四十亩。我们参观了一个叫做尼子才的村庄，这一个小村，过去被德国法西斯完全平毁了，而现在已经重建了一个更好的新村，其中的设备也是非常的好，村民的生活差不多也完全电气化了。在捷克，我们看到了一个几千人的男女青年的建设大队，有一条很长的铁路是完全由他们建筑起来的。在这里，我们看到，东欧新民主国家，在苏联的帮助之下，在东欧各国之间的互助之下，尤其是在他们全国人民一致的努力之下，在战后短短五年当中，他们的建设事业，已经获得了极大的成绩。
  胜利的中国人民到处受到欢迎和尊重
    在我们出国的几个月时间里，使我们更加深刻的感到了我们中国人民的胜利对于巩固世界和平的意义。我们中国人到处受到这么热烈的欢迎和尊重的情形是从来没有过的。在每个场合之下，我们中国代表团都受着欢呼和包围，我们走到那里都可以听到人们在高呼中国人民万岁和毛泽东万岁，在许多地方，人们拥过来要和我们握手，要我们签名，要我们讲话。在捷克的首都，青年们把我们的汽车挡住，把我们从汽车上抱下来，把我们高举在空中。在最热闹的大街上游行，人们象发狂一样的来抬着我们，呼喊着毛泽东，拥挤在我们的周围。当我们到柏林去的时候，德国人民组织了四百里长的一条欢迎线，一路上我们到处被欢迎，一面向柏林前进，一面还参加了五个盛大的欢迎会。在柏林七十万青年人大游行的时候，我们不但到处可以看到毛主席的画像和听到庆祝中国人民胜利和巩固中德人民团结的口号，而且他们还组织了一个七、八百人的毛泽东队，在那里完全拿的是毛主席像，而且热烈的喊着口号，当他们发现了我们中国代表的时候，更是狂热的不得了。在游行的队伍里，在青年和少年的活动当中，以及在经济建设的队伍当中，我们到处都可以听到毛泽东队的称号。我们四万万七千五百万中国人民的胜利，有力的援助着世界人民的和平事业，同时，伟大的世界人民的斗争，也同样的巩固着我们中国人民的胜利。
        反对美国侵略罪行，坚决解放台湾！
    现在，我们中国代表团回来了，我们兴奋的回来参加今天纪念我们人民解放军的建军节。我是一个革命的军人，我曾经积极的参加了中国人民革命事业的英勇斗争。在中国共产党领导之下，我们全国人民经过了艰苦英勇的奋斗，我们终于得到了今天的胜利。现在美帝国主义及其帮凶发动了侵略朝鲜人民的战争，开了舰队到我们的台湾，企图阻止我们去解放，并且使用各种阴谋手段来加紧对东方各国人民的侵略和奴役。对于美帝国主义这种罪恶行动，是全世界爱好和平的人都坚决反对的，而我们中国人民和人民解放军全体指战员都将一致的起来，加强准备，随时都可给以粉碎的打击，中国人民就象一个巨人一样，任凭帝国主义如何的疯狂，台湾一定要解放，朝鲜人民必将得到最后的胜利，任何的侵略阴谋，都只能加速侵略者自己的死亡。
