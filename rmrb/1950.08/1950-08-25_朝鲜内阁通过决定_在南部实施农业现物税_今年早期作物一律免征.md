　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 24th: The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in accordance with the decree of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly on implementing land reform in the southern half of the Republic, passed a resolution on the 18th regarding the implementation of agricultural tax in kind in the southern half of the Republic. This decision aims to change the backwardness of the economy and culture of farmers in the southern half of the Republic, who have already been freed from the reactionary rule of the Syngman Rhee gang and the oppression of landlords; and to improve the living standards of farmers under democratic principles, giving farmers the possible conditions to actively participate in national economic construction.

　　The decision stipulates that the agricultural tax in kind for early crops (wheat, barley, early vegetables, early fruits) in 1950 will be exempt. The tax in kind for late crops will be levied in accordance with the current decree - the decision on revising the agricultural tax in kind. Agricultural tax in kind will not be levied on land reclaimed by farmers themselves for less than three years; crops damaged by war will be reduced or exempted from taxation depending on the circumstances.

　　朝鲜内阁通过决定
    在南部实施农业现物税
    今年早期作物一律免征
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁，根据最高人民会议常任委员会关于在共和国南半部地区实施土地改革的政令，于十八日通过一项关于在共和国南半部地区实施农业现物税的决定。这项决定旨在改变业已摆脱了李承晚匪帮反动统治及地主压迫的共和国南半部农民经济及文化的落后性；并在民主原则下提高农民生活水平，予农民以积极参加国家经济建设的可能条件。
    决定规定一九五零年早期作物（小麦、大麦、早期蔬菜、早期果实）的农业现物税予以免收；晚期作物的现物税则将根据现行法令——关于改订农业现物税的决定来征收。农民自己开垦的土地不满三年者不征收农业现物税；由于战争遭到损害的农作物，则根据情况予以减收或免收。
