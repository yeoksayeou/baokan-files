Constantly Cultivating Female Labor Advanced Producers
    ——The Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' Experience in Organizing Female Workers to Participate in Production Emulation Drives

Under the organization and leadership of trade unions at all levels, mass production movements are flourishing across the country. Female workers, a part of the working class, have generally lagged behind in production technology, politics, and culture as a result of long-term discrimination and oppression in the old society. This requires the trade union's women's work department to put in extra effort to enlighten female workers' class consciousness and production enthusiasm, and to help and promote them to participate in production emulation drives just like male workers, and to shoulder the glorious construction tasks of the working class. The Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has achieved preliminary results and experience in this regard.

In January of this year, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions selected and rewarded municipal model workers, but only one female worker was among the 121 model workers selected. This issue drew the attention of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' women's work department, which believed that with more than 30,000 female workers in the city (accounting for 9.43 percent of the total number of workers), especially in industries such as textiles and tobacco where the vast majority are direct production workers, the failure to have female model workers playing a leading role would make it difficult to mobilize the enthusiasm of the female worker masses, which would hinder and damage the production movement. Therefore, in conjunction with the production department, it put forward three criteria for evaluating outstanding female workers based on the existing level of female workers: (1) Active in production and exceeding targets. (2) United with the masses and overcoming difficulties. (3) Putting forward rationalization proposals or improving work methods and tools to increase output, quality, and save raw materials. Factories were mobilized to select 255 outstanding female workers in production. After preliminary review by the various industrial trade unions, 67 of the most outstanding were selected. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' women's work department then held a symposium to introduce each person's outstanding deeds and discussed them in groups. Finally, 31 first, second, and third-class model workers were selected. At the city's nearly 3,000-person female worker and female student joint celebration of "March 8th" International Women's Day, the female model workers wore glorious red flowers and received various prizes personally awarded by Huang Huoqing, director of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. The Tianjin Daily published photos of the female model workers and a special issue, and the glory board of the Cultural Palace also listed their names and outstanding deeds in detail.

Due to the leadership's emphasis on selecting and cultivating outstanding female workers, the grand ceremony of the "March 8th" awards ceremony and the outstanding deeds of the female model workers greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the city's female workers to learn from the outstanding female workers, and also promoted the attention of administrative trade unions of enterprises and factories to cultivate the outstanding female workers of their own factories. After "March 8th," many units, such as the People's Bank of China and garment factories, conducted their own evaluations and awards for outstanding female workers, which played a significant role in promoting production. In 59 factories in the city with female workers, the female workers actively participated in the production emulation drive. In the No. 3 Textile Mill, female workers accounted for 40 percent of the more than 3,000 workers. In the Red May emulation drive, 190 female workers won awards, accounting for more than 50 percent of all the award winners. Female workers at the Yitang Rubber Factory, who make military shoes, have greatly improved their output and quality. Their most recent finished products have been approved for inspection-free status.

Since being selected as model workers and receiving awards, the outstanding female workers themselves have been working harder to improve themselves. Coupled with the supervision of the masses, they have made rapid progress in recent months. A recent survey of the 31 outstanding female workers selected on "March 8th" showed that 17 had made rapid progress, while 14 had maintained their original state with poorer results. For example, Li Zhaozhen of the No. 4 Garment Factory is an administrative team leader who previously only worked hard to increase output. After being selected as a model worker and seeing the outstanding deeds of others, she felt inadequate and paid more attention to uniting with her fellow workers. Whenever the trade union made calls, she would discuss them with everyone, encourage everyone to work hard, save water and electricity, save materials, improve quality, and pay attention to avoiding defective products. She called on everyone in the team to use the prizes she won on "March 8th" and cared about other people's problems, making everyone more united and harmonious. When some backward workers made strange remarks and did not pay attention to saving and hygiene, she would automatically help them sweep the floor, wipe the machines, and turn off the lights for them after work, which moved them to become more active. When some teams quarreled with her team, she bought sugar and fruit out of her own pocket and invited everyone to a symposium to explain the misunderstandings. She felt that it was not enough to improve one team or one workshop, but that everyone should work together to improve the entire factory. Liu Yinfu, a thread-twisting female worker at the No. 3 Textile Mill, used to be taciturn and did not approach the masses much. Because her home was far away, she did not participate in night school. After being selected as an outstanding female worker, she often cared about the diseases and menstrual pain of the female worker masses and actively helped them find female worker committee members to solve their problems. In the Red May emulation drive, she not only exceeded her own plan but also helped others exceed their plans. After "March 8th," she joined the night school and mobilized and organized all the workers in her workshop to participate in cultural studies. She has a very good relationship with the masses. On the "July 1st" Party Day, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

On July 16th, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions' women's work department convened the second symposium of outstanding female workers. During this period, most of the outstanding female workers who had been selected had made great progress, and many new outstanding female workers had emerged. Everyone reported their new contributions to the production emulation drive, exchanged experiences, and improved production. Hua Guizhen of the No. 5 Textile Mill created a method of threading reeds. In the past, two people worked on one shaft, threading six in thirteen hours, which was not enough for the fabric factory. She proposed that one person thread the shaft, with a board in the middle to replace the manpower, using her left hand to batch the thread from below and her right hand to take the hook from above, which was even faster than two people doing it. She could do seven a day, threading so many shafts that the fabric factory could not use them all. Wei Guanzhu, a fine yarn female worker at the Beiyang Yarn Factory, discussed with everyone and proposed a mutual aid work method, with doffers helping spinners to join threads, and spinners helping doffers to sweep the aisles, wind threads, and help doffers who are running to the front and back of the frames, so that everyone could go to the toilet and breastfeed without delaying their work. As a result, the number of hanks run per day increased from 9.22-9.3 to 9.43-9.67, and the amount of waste cotton returned decreased from 9.5-13 pounds to 8 pounds. This not only avoided trouble but also earned more wages. Dong Yanbin, a female worker at the Hengyuan Yarn Factory, organized more than 70 female workers to learn conservation technology in their spare time every week, learning from veteran technical workers, fostering good teacher-student relationships, and learning to install frames. These achievements made all the outstanding female workers more clear about their future goals.

Selecting outstanding female workers is a good way to encourage female workers to actively participate in production emulation drives. In this work, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has the following preliminary experiences:

(1) Starting from the existing level of female workers, finding outstanding examples among the masses, and rewarding and commending them, using the outstanding actions of the masses themselves to educate and encourage the masses, so that female workers will not lose their self-confidence, and will actively and gradually improve their skills, study their business, and play a greater role in the production movement.

(2) Through such selection work, the women's work departments of trade unions at all levels and the leadership can understand and grasp the production activists among the female worker masses, help and cultivate them, and through them, implement the resolutions of the trade union among the female worker masses.

(3) Regularly convene symposia of outstanding female workers to exchange experiences and constantly improve the level of the original outstanding female workers, so that they can develop into comprehensive models. More new outstanding female workers can emerge through each selection. (Compiled by Shi Meimei, Women's Work Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions)

　　经常地培养女工先进生产者
    ——天津市总组织女工参加生产竞赛的经验
    在各级工会的组织和领导下，全国各地群众性的生产运动正在蓬勃展开。女工——工人阶级的一部分，因在旧社会长期地受歧视与压迫的结果，一般的在生产技术、政治、文化水平方面较差一步。这就需要工会女工部多加一把力，启发女工的阶级觉悟和生产积极性，帮助和推动她们与男工一样地参加生产竞赛，担负起工人阶级光荣的建设任务。天津市总工会女工部在这方面曾获得了初步的成绩和经验。
    今年一月，天津总工会曾评选奖励全市劳动模范，在评选的一百二十一名模范中只有一个女工。这个问题引起市总女工部的注意，认为全市三万多女工（占工人总数百分之九点四三），特别是纺织、烟草等业中绝大多数是直接生产工，如果没有女工模范在其中起带头作用，女工群众的积极性不易发动，将使生产运动受到阻碍与损失。因此与生产部共同研究，从女工现有水平出发，提出三个评选优秀女工的标准：（一）生产积极、超过任务。（二）团结群众、克服困难。（三）提出过合理化建议或改进工作方法、工具，提高产量、质量，节省原料的。发动各厂评选出生产中的优秀女工共二百五十五人，经各产业工会初步审查确定更优秀的六十七人，并由市总女工部召开座谈会，互相介绍各人的优秀事迹，分组讨论，最后评定出一、二、三等模范三十一人。在全市近三千人的女工、女学生联欢庆祝“三、八”节的大会上，女工模范带着光荣的大红花，由市总工会黄火青主任亲自发给各种奖品。天津日报为女工模范登了照片、出了专刊，文化宫的光荣榜上也详细列出了她们的名字与优秀事迹。
    由于领导上对选拔培养优秀女工的重视，“三、八”节发奖大会隆重的仪式及女工模范的优秀事迹，大大鼓舞了全市女工群众的情绪，要求向优秀女工学习，也推动了各企业、工厂行政工会注意培养本厂的优秀女工。“三、八”节后，很多单位如人民银行、被服厂等都在本单位进行了优秀女工的评选和发奖，对推动生产起了很大的作用。全市五十九个有女工的工厂，女工都积极参加了生产竞赛。中纺三厂三千多工友中女工占百分之四十，红五月竞赛中得奖女工一百九十人，占全体得奖的百分之五十强。义堂橡胶厂女工做军鞋，产量、质量大大提高，最近做出的成品都准予免检了。
    优秀女工本身，自当选模范，受了奖励后，更积极努力提高自己，加上群众的督促，几个月来，进步很快，最近调查“三、八”选上的三十一名优秀女工，进步很快的十七人，维持原状成绩较差的十四人。如被服四厂李兆珍是行政小组长，以往只是闷头干活，提高产量。当选模范后，看到别人的优秀事迹，自觉不够，更注意团结工友。工会有号召就和大家商量，鼓励大家好好干，节约水电、材料，提高质量，注意不出废品。在组里把“三、八”得的奖品叫大家使用，关心别人的问题，使大家搞得更团结融洽。有个别落后的工友说怪话，不注意节约与卫生工作，她就自动帮他们扫地、擦机器、下班后代他们关灯，感动得他们也积极起来。有的小组与她组闹意气，她自己掏钱买了糖和水果叫大家在一起开座谈会联欢，解释了误会。她觉得搞好一个小组，一个车间还不够，要和大家一起努力搞好全厂。中纺三厂捻头女工刘荫福，过去性情沉默，不大接近群众，因家远也没参加夜校学习。当选优秀女工后，经常关心女工群众的疾病和经期痛苦，积极地帮助她们找女工委员解决。红五月竞赛中，不但自己超过计划，还帮助别人超过计划。“三、八”节后，她就参加了夜校，并动员组织了本车间全体工友参加了文化学习。与群众关系非常好，“七一”党生日，她光荣的参加了中国共产党。
    七月十六日市总女工部又召集了第二次优秀女工座谈会，这期间被评选的优秀女工多半有很大的进步，另外又涌现了很多新的优秀女工。大家报告了在生产竞赛中的新贡献，互相交流经验，搞好生产。中纺五厂花桂珍创造了一个穿棕的工作方法，过去两个人?一个轴，十三小时?六个，供不上布厂用，她提议一个人?轴，中间弄块板代替人工，左手在底下批线，右手在上面拿钩子，还比两个人?的快，一天能做七个，?的轴使布厂用不完。北洋纱厂细纱女工魏冠珠与大家商量提出互助的工作方法，落纱工帮助当车工接头，当车工帮助落纱工扫弄堂，缠线，跑车头车尾的拨过来又帮助落纱，使大家在上厕所和奶孩子时不耽误活，结果每天跑亨司从九点二二——九点三提高到九点四三——九点六七，回花从九点五——十三磅减少到八磅，既避免了麻烦，又多挣了工钱。恒源纱厂女工董妍斌组织了女工七十余人，在每星期业余时间学习保全技术，向老技术工人学习，搞好师徒关系，学会了装车。这些成绩使所有的优秀女工更明确了今后努力的目标。
    评选优秀女工是鼓励女工积极参加生产竞赛的一个好办法，在这一工作中，天津市总女工部有这样几点初步经验：
    （一）从女工现有水平出发，找出群众中的优秀榜样，加以奖励表扬，用群众自己的优秀行动来教育和鼓舞群众，使女工不致失掉自信心，而积极的逐步提高技术，钻研业务，在生产运动中发挥更大的作用。
    （二）经过这样的评选工作，各级工会女工部及领导上可以了解掌握女工群众中的生产积极分子，加以帮助培养，并通过她们把工会的决议贯彻到女工群众中去。
    （三）经常的定期的召集优秀女工座谈会，交流经验，不断提高原有优秀女工的水平，使她们发展成全面的模范。并可以通过每次评选，涌现出更多的新的优秀女工。（全总女工部史美玫整理）
