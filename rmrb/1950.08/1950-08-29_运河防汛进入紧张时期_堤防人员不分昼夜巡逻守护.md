　　Canal Flood Control Enters Tense Period
    Dike Personnel Patrol and Guard Day and Night

    [This Newspaper Comprehensive Dispatch] The canal flood control has entered a tense period. Currently, the Huai River flood peak has entered the canal via Hongze Lake. On the 10th of this month, the water level at Jiangba in Hongze Lake reached 13.31 meters, after which the water level began to slowly decline, falling to 12.82 meters on the 27th. The water level of Gaoyou Lake rose to 8.59 meters on the 22nd, and then began to decline, dropping to 8.48 meters on the 27th. The canal water level is slowly rising and is expected to reach its peak.

    In order to safely pass the current flood peak and prepare for possible storm attacks, the repair of dangerous sections and elimination of hidden dangers of the Honghu Dam have been completed after strict inspection. After the establishment of the Honghu Dam Flood Control Headquarters, a unit of the People's Liberation Army has been redeployed to garrison the construction site, ready to deal with emergencies at any time. The west dike of the Li Canal continues to be reinforced with stone revetments and the construction of secondary embankments. The West Dike Command Post has been established to be responsible for protection. Within the Gaoyou territory, the area from Shigongtou to Jieshou is divided into four sections for defense. Two hundred and fifty-eight technicians have formed a West Dike Emergency Repair Team, patrolling day and night, and taking responsibility for their assigned sections. In addition, six large boats are fully loaded with sacks, straw bags, bricks, and stones for emergency repair materials, ready for urgent needs. At the most dangerous sections, such as Yumatou, electric lights have been installed to facilitate patrols and emergency repairs. The east dike project of the canal, at dangerous sections such as Zhongba and Tieniuwan within Gaoyou territory, has been initially consolidated after emergency repairs. However, due to excessive flood pressure, seepage and slope collapses of the dike body continue to occur. In order to learn from the lessons of the Zhongba incident, a full-line inspection has been carried out, and emergency repairs are carried out whenever dangers are discovered. The main dangerous sections in the southern section have been repaired successively since the 20th, and the heightening and thickening project in the northern section has been completed more than 90% by the 22nd. In addition to the original unit of the People's Liberation Army assisting, a 3,000-strong emergency repair team has been organized as a mobile force. The flood control organization along the dike has been strengthened and consolidated compared to before, and materials are fully prepared. Therefore, although the water level has been rising daily since the 22nd, no serious danger has occurred so far. The canal defense has gradually shifted from passive to active. Currently, the water level is approaching its peak, and flood control personnel along the dike are closely patrolling and guarding day and night, regardless of wind or rain, to prevent the occurrence of dangerous situations.

　　运河防汛进入紧张时期
    堤防人员不分昼夜巡逻守护
    【本报综合讯】运河防汛已进入紧张时期。目前淮河洪水峰已经洪泽湖进入运河。本月十日，洪泽湖蒋坝水位到达一三·三一公尺后，水势即开始缓缓下降，二十七日已落到一二·八二公尺。高邮湖水位，二十二日涨至八·五九公尺，以后即开始下降，二十七日已降到八·四八公尺。而运河水位则缓缓上升，目前已将达顶点。
    为争取安度当前洪水峰，准备应付可能的风暴袭击，洪湖大堤的险工修补及暗险的消灭，经严密检查后，现已完工。洪湖大堤防汛指挥所成立后，现已补调解放军一部，驻守工地，准备随时抢险。里运河西堤，现仍继续加强护堤石堰和加修子埝，并已增设西堤指挥所负责防护。在高邮境内由石工头至界首分四段防守，并组成了二百五十八个技工的西堤抢险队，日夜巡逻，分段负责；另备有大船六只，满贮麻袋、草包、砖石等抢险器材，以备急需；在最险的工段上如御码头等处，已装设电灯，便利巡查抢险。运河东堤工程，高邮境内之中坝、铁牛湾等处险工发生险象后，经抢修已初步巩固。但由于洪水压力过大，堤身窨潮塌坡仍续有发生。为吸收中坝出险教训，已进行全线检查，发现险象随时抢修。现南段各主要险工均于二十日陆续修竣，北段加高培厚工程二十二日已完百分之九十以上。除原调解放军一部协助外，现又组织三千民工之抢险队，作为机动力量。沿堤防汛组织已较前健全巩固，器材亦准备充分，因此自二十二日起，水位虽逐日上涨，但至今尚无严重险象发生。运河防务已渐由被动转入主动。目前水位已近顶点，沿堤防汛人员正不分昼夜风雨严密巡逻守护，防止险象发生。
