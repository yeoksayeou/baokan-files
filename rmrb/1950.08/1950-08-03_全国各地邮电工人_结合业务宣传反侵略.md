　　National Postal and Telecommunications Workers
    Combine Business with Anti-Aggression Propaganda
    [This newspaper dispatch] Postal and telecommunications workers across the country, responding to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, have enthusiastically launched a movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. The Tianjin postal district's telegraph section, starting on July 16th, organized propaganda teams to go to the streets to disseminate information every day at 6:30 PM. When the propaganda teams took to the streets, many people joined their ranks to march, and passengers on streetcars also responded enthusiastically. All postal workers in the Shandong Provincial Postal Administration Bureau studied important documents related to defending world peace on July 21st and 22nd. It was decided that all employees of the bureau, except for a small number on duty, would participate in anti-American aggression demonstrations. The Tangshan Post Office printed more than 100,000 small slips with propaganda slogans, and the Jinan Post Office printed more than 30,000, asking letter writers to paste them on envelopes to widely publicize the shameful crimes of American aggression in Taiwan and Korea. The staff of the Nanning Post Office in Guangxi pasted anti-American aggression slogans on 35,000 outgoing and incoming letters and sent them out together. In order to express their firm opposition to this act of aggression by the United States, postal and telecommunications workers in Shanghai and other places set up signature areas at the entrances of various business departments, mobilizing the masses to sign the peace declaration in order to strengthen the forces defending world peace. The staff of the Nanyang Telecommunications Bureau in Henan actively mobilized their families to participate in the signing. The delegates of the Fourth Congress of the Wuhan Telecommunications Trade Union sent a telegram on July 19th to all telecommunications workers in the Hubei region: "Intensify production and do a good job in the people's telecommunications business with practical actions to support the liberation of Taiwan and support the Korean people in their war against American aggression." All the staff of the Beijing Post Office held an emergency discussion meeting, expressing extreme indignation at the United States' blatant aggression in Taiwan and Korea. Everyone unanimously recognized that the world peace camp is powerful, and the United States' mad aggression is tantamount to digging its own grave, and will only lead to its own demise in the end.
