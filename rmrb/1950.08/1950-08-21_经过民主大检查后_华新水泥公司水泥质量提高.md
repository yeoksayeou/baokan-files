　　After Democratic Inspection
    Huaxin Cement Company Improves Cement Quality
    [This newspaper's Hankou report] Following a joint inspection by the Central-South Region People's Supervisory Committee, the Central-South Heavy Industry Department, and the Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions into a serious accident involving substandard quality cement at the jointly operated public-private Huaxin Cement Company in Daye, Hubei, the company actively improved production. In June, it created a new record for the physical performance of cement since the kiln's opening, with increased production, extended kiln life, and significantly reduced coal consumption.
    From August of last year to March of this year, the company produced over 10,000 tons of substandard cement, accounting for about one-third of the output during the same period. Currently, 8,000 tons of this substandard cement remain within the factory, while the rest has entered the market. This not only ties up billions in capital but, more seriously, the use of bad cement in national construction will cause incalculable losses. As early as August of last year, the factory discovered that the cement had a quick-setting phenomenon, but it did not attract attention. In November and December of last year, the deterioration of this cement became more severe, and it was found that the tensile strength did not meet the standard, but this still did not attract the attention of the company's leadership. In January of this year, the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government ordered cement and requested ash samples from the company. The company could not find forty pounds of standard sample in more than six thousand tons of cement in four warehouses. This serious situation did not prompt the company's leadership to be vigilant and actively seek ways to improve quality. On the contrary, the company adopted the deceptive means of speculative merchants, barely putting together forty pounds of ash sample, accompanied by advertisements for cement quality, and sent it to the Ministry of Railways of the Central Government. When cement was selling well this year, the company mixed 25 kilograms of quick-setting ash into each bag of cement, resulting in more than 550 tons of bad ash entering the market. The company did not recognize that this kind of behavior would bring serious damage to national construction and the lives of the people, but thought "It's all right as long as we make money back." By March of this year, users had reported that the school buildings of the Central-South Military and Political University and the piers of the Daijiashan Bridge built by the Hubei Highway Bureau had cracked because of the use of cement from the factory.
    In order to correct the above serious phenomena, under the mobilization of the joint inspection team, the factory launched a mass democratic inspection from May 1st to 20th, exposing the serious situation of the company's leadership being irresponsible to the people's enterprise and being divorced from the masses. Wang Jian, the deputy military representative of the factory, had a vague production point of view, shouting production slogans, but he himself stood outside of production, not only not producing but also not learning, not understanding the production situation and not inspecting, only satisfied with the numbers, not paying attention to improving quality. In his self-criticism, he said: "I only thought that it was enough to know the production process. I looked at the production monthly report at the beginning, but later I couldn't understand some places, so I didn't look at it at all." Wang Tao, the general manager of the company, knew that the raw materials of the stone mountain were impure and might cause quick-setting problems, but he did not pay attention to it. In November last year, when the cement quality had a serious problem, he only made a brief phone call to inquire about it, and when he heard that it had been corrected, he never bothered with it again. His thinking influenced many senior staff members, forming a common work style of being irresponsible to the people's enterprise. Last November, the staff and workers put forward more than 400 rationalization proposals, many of which were related to improving quality, but the company did not adopt or attach importance to them at all, and even some suggestions were not read at all. In this way, the company's leadership was seriously divorced from the masses, which dampened the production enthusiasm of the masses, so that the masses were unwilling to raise their opinions again. Secondly, based on the above reasons, the unscientific and unreasonable nature of the company's production organization failed to be reformed in time, which also directly affected production. For example, the work of various departments was not connected to each other, and each department acted on its own, so that the production procedures (kiln, mill, and laboratory departments) that should not be divided were divided into three separate stages, causing chaos in the work system. At the same time, due to the lack of a production responsibility system and a job assessment system, the responsibilities were unclear, and rewards and punishments were not clear.
    After in-depth inspection, the Central-South Heavy Industry Department has submitted a request to the Central-South Military and Political Committee to transfer to the Central Government for the deserved punishment of the company's derelict personnel; and promulgated emergency measures to improve the company's quality, stipulating the production responsibility system and administrative responsibility system that should be established, and strengthening the inspection of products. On June 2, the company formally established a democratic management committee, and then the entire factory began reorganization, solving some unreasonable phenomena in the organizational structure and personnel. Through the efforts of all staff and workers, the quality of the company's products in June was unprecedentedly improved; according to three-day statistics, the average tensile strength was 452 pounds (per square inch), and the average compressive strength was 4215 pounds (per square inch), which exceeded the standard by a lot. The quick-setting phenomenon was completely eradicated, and the color changed from yellow to cyan-black, creating a new record for physical performance since the kiln's opening. In addition, the life of the kiln has been extended from one or two weeks to twenty-nine days, thus increasing production, and coal consumption has also been greatly reduced. All staff and workers are uniting to improve quality, increase production, and reduce costs.

### 经过民主大检查后  华新水泥公司水泥质量提高

　　经过民主大检查后
    华新水泥公司水泥质量提高
    【本报汉口讯】今年五月间，中南区人民监察委员会、中南重工业部及湖北省总工会联合检查湖北大冶公私合营华新水泥公司质量不合规格的严重事故后，该公司积极改进生产，六月份已创造了开窑以来水泥的物理性能新纪录，产量增加，窑的寿命延长，煤耗也大大降低。
    该公司从去年八月到今年三月，共出产不合规格的水泥一万吨以上，约占同时期产量的三分之一。目前此种不合规格的水泥存在厂内的尚有八千吨，其余均已流入市场，这不仅积压了几十亿的资金，更严重的是坏水泥用于国家建筑上，将造成难以估计的损失。去年八月，该厂就发现水泥有快结现象，但未引起注意。去年十一、十二两月，此种水泥变质情形更加严重，已发现拉力不合标准，但仍未引起该公司领导上的重视。今年一月，中央铁道部订购水泥，向该公司要灰样，该公司在四个仓库六千多吨水泥中竟找不出四十磅合标准的样子，这一严重情况并没有促使该公司领导上的警惕，积极设法改进质量。相反，该公司采取了投机商人的欺骗手段，勉强凑了四十磅灰样，带上水泥品质的广告，送到中央铁道部。今年水泥畅销时，该公司就在每包麻袋水泥中掺入二十五公斤快凝灰，致使五百五十多吨坏灰流入市场。该公司没有认识到此种行为会给国家建设和人民生命带来严重损害，却认为“赚钱回来就算了”。到今年三月，用户纷纷反映：中南军政大学校舍、湖北公路局所筑戴家山桥梁桥墩等，均因用该厂水泥，已发生裂缝现象。
    为纠正上述严重现象，在联合检查组的发动下，该厂自五月一日至二十日开展了群众性的民主大检查，暴露了该公司领导上存在着对人民企业不负责任及脱离群众的严重情况。该厂副军事代表王健生产观点模糊，空喊生产口号，自己却站在生产以外，不仅生产也不学习，不了解生产情况也不检查，只满足于数字，不注意提高品质。他在自我检讨中说：“只以为能知道生产过程就可以了，生产月报开始时还看看，以后因有些地方看不懂，根本就不看了。”该公司总经理王涛明知石山原料不纯，可能产生快结毛病，但未加注意。去年十一月，水泥品质发生了严重毛病，他只草草打电话询问一下，听说已经纠正，就再也不管了。他的思想影响了很多高级职员，形成普遍的对人民企业不负责任的工作作风。去年十一月职工共提出四百多条合理化建议，其中有许多是有关改良品质的，但该公司一概不予采纳和重视，甚至有一部分建议根本没看。这样，就造成该公司领导的严重脱离群众，打击了群众生产情绪，使群众有意见也不愿再提。其次，基于以上原因，该公司生产机构的不科学和不合理，未能得到及时的改革，也直接影响了生产。如各部门工作互不联系，各自为政，使不应分割的生产程序（窑、磨、化验三部）划为三个单独阶段，造成了工作制度混乱。同时由于没有生产责任制，没有考工考勤制，使职责不清，赏罚不明。
    经过深入检查，中南重工业部对该公司失职人员，已呈请中南军政委员会转请中央给予应得的处分；并颁布了改进该公司品质的紧急措施，规定了应该建立的生产责任制和行政责任制，加强了产品的检验。六月二日该公司正式成立民主管理委员会，接着全厂开始整编，解决了组织机构及人事上若干不合理的现象。经过全体职工的努力，该公司六月分产品质量空前提高；据三天统计，拉力平均为四五二磅（每平方英寸），耐压力平均四二一五磅（每平方英寸），超过标准很多。快凝现象完全根除，颜色由黄色变为青黑色，创造了开窑以来物理性能的新纪录。此外，窑的寿命已由一两个星期延长到二十九天，因而增加了产量，煤耗也大大降低。全体职工正团结一致为提高质量、增加产量、降低成本而努力。
