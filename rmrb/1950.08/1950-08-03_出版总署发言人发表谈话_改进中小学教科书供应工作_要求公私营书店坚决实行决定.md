Xinhua News Agency: A spokesman for the Central People's Government's Publishing Administration issued a statement regarding the improvement of textbook supply for primary and secondary schools and the reduction of textbook prices for the fall semester:

Regarding the publication and distribution of textbooks for primary and secondary schools, with the exception of the Northeast region, which is entirely managed by Xinhua Bookstore and has gradually become regularized over the past year, most regions within the customs are operated jointly by Xinhua Bookstore and private bookstores. Beijing and Shanghai have joint public-private joint publishing house organizations. Their work has been successful. However, their work also has many shortcomings, especially the textbook supply work in the newly liberated areas, which experienced many unreasonable and chaotic phenomena during the spring semester of this year, and necessary improvements should be made quickly.

Judging from the textbook supply situation in various regions this spring, the basic shortcomings are untimely supply, inaccurate supply quantities, and high book prices. Some schools have been in session for quite some time, and students have not yet received some of the new textbooks that must be used. Although this is mainly due to the overdue completion of editing and reviewing work, it is also because the publishing and distribution work has not seized the time, resulting in inaccurate supply quantities. Either a large amount of inventory is piled up and cannot be sold, or the number of copies printed is insufficient for distribution and must be reprinted, which increases costs and wastes time. In order to ensure accurate supply quantities, publishers must conduct serious investigations to grasp the actual situation, and at the same time, rely on the close cooperation of educational administrative authorities and schools. Due to the impact of excessively high prices, students cannot afford books, and the phenomenon of two or three people sharing one book or relying on teachers to copy on the blackboard has occurred, which is worthy of attention. According to the current state of the country's finances, it is not possible to provide huge subsidies for textbooks, and private capital participating in textbook supply must be guaranteed a certain legitimate profit. However, within the realm of possibility, striving for rationalized operations and reducing profits to reasonably lower textbook prices is still necessary. Whether public or private publishers, they have an obligation to do so in textbook work.

The prices of textbooks this spring varied greatly in different regions. For example, the price in individual areas of Sichuan was about three times higher than in North China, and the price in Changsha was about twice as high as in North China. This imbalance is not entirely due to the different printing costs in different regions. In Guangzhou, the Xinhua Bookstore, in conjunction with local private bookstores, organized a textbook supply committee, and the prices of the textbooks it printed were calculated in terms of bank real savings units, so that the actual selling price changed daily. This is even more obviously for the benefit of the publisher, without considering the interests of those who buy and use textbooks. Changsha's public and private bookstores jointly printed textbooks, investing in 3,300 reams of white paper, and after settlement, the net profit reached 6,000 reams, which is 180% of the investment amount. The profits of public-private joint ventures in Hankou, Hangzhou, Jinhua and other places are all more than doubled. This kind of behavior of seeking illegal profits on textbooks is completely wrong and it is absolutely impossible to use reasons such as lack of experience or price fluctuations during printing, adding the loss of rising prices when calculating costs, and then prices falling when collecting book payments, etc., as an excuse. The Xinhua Bookstore in these regions failed to lead the private bookstores well in this work and should be blamed first. At the same time, on the other hand, there are also phenomena in some places where Xinhua Bookstore refuses to cooperate with private bookstores. For example, in Chongqing, the Xinhua Bookstore failed to organize private bookstores to participate in the publication and distribution of textbooks in the spring, so that on the one hand, many schools did not get new textbooks, and on the other hand, more than 600,000 copies of inventory failed to be sold, which is of course also a wrong practice.

After reviewing the textbook supply situation this spring, the Publishing Administration believes that the Administration should also be responsible for failing to make timely arrangements for the work in various regions in the past. As the fall textbook supply work is about to begin, the Publishing Administration has specifically consulted with the Ministry of Education and issued the "Decision of the Ministry of Education and the Publishing Administration of the Central People's Government on Textbooks for Primary and Secondary Schools in the Autumn of 1950" and the "Decision of the Ministry of Education and the Publishing Administration of the Central People's Government on Reducing and Unifying the Prices and Supply Methods of Textbooks in the Autumn of 1950" two documents, notifying all regions to implement them uniformly, on the one hand, in order to gradually unify the textbooks used in primary and secondary schools in various regions, and on the other hand, to improve the textbook supply work and reasonably reduce book prices to reduce the burden on students. The decision stipulates the pricing standards for autumn textbooks, so that textbook prices are first unified in the North China, East China, and Central South regions. At the same time, in order to prevent adding additional costs to readers in remote rural areas, it also stipulates a unified payment method of 5% of freight nationwide, with the shortfall subsidized by the Publishing Administration. According to the new pricing standards, textbook prices this fall will be considerably lower than this spring in all regions, and will be much lower in some regions.

Implementing the methods in the decision may be very difficult for individual places with particularly difficult conditions. Moreover, since the publication and distribution of textbooks for primary and secondary schools is a very complex task, and the conditions in various places are different, some unforeseen difficulties may arise. The Publishing Administration believes that implementing these decisions is beneficial to the 17 million primary and secondary school students nationwide, can play a good role in promoting education in various regions, and will also help adjust the public-private relationship in the publishing industry. Therefore, the Publishing Administration first requires the public, public-private joint venture textbook publishing and distribution institutions in various regions to resolutely implement these decisions and lead private bookstores to cooperate in their implementation. If you encounter various difficulties and problems, you can ask your superiors for assistance in solving them. However, it is absolutely not allowed to refuse to implement these decisions for this reason. On the other hand, if public and private bookstores in various places sell textbooks in violation of the above decision, failing to sell them at the monetary prices marked on the books, or if there are various shortcomings and errors in the textbook distribution work, it is hoped that schools and people from all walks of life in various places will report to the local news publishing bureau and news publishing office at any time so as to urge improvement.

### 出版总署发言人发表谈话  改进中小学教科书供应工作  要求公私营书店坚决实行决定

    改进中小学教科书供应工作
    要求公私营书店坚决实行决定
    【新华社讯】中央人民政府出版总署发言人为改进中小学教科书供应工作并减低秋季教科书售价事，发表谈话如下：
    关于中小学教科书的出版和发行工作，除东北完全由新华书店负责，一年来已逐渐走上正轨外，关内各地区大都由新华书店及私营书店合作经营，北京和上海有公私合营的联合出版社的组织。他们的工作都是有成绩的。但同时他们的工作中也还有很多缺点，特别是各新解放区的教科书供应工作，在今年春季开学时，出现了许多不合理的混乱现象，应该迅速进行必要的改进。
    就今年春季各地区教科书的供应情形来看，基本缺点是供应不及时，供应数量不准确和书价太高。有的学校开学已甚久，学生还没有得到某些必须采用的新课本。这虽然主要由于编辑审订工作逾期完成，但也由于出版发行工作没有抓紧时间，供应数量不准确的结果。或者积压大量存书，卖不出去，或者印数不够分配，必须添印，既增成本，又误时间。为使供应数量准确，出版者必须认真进行调查，掌握实际情况，同时也要靠教育行政当局和各学校的密切配合。由于售价过高的影响，学生买不起书，二三人合用一书，或靠教师在黑板上传抄的现象已经发生，这是值得注意的。按目前国家的财政状况，尚不可能对教科书作巨额的津贴，而对于参加教科书供应的私人资本，又须保障其一定的合法利润。但是在可能范围内，力求经营合理化，并减低利润，使教科书的定价合理地降低，仍是必要的。无论公私出版业者，在教科书工作上都有义务这样作。
    今年春季的教科书书价在各地区很不一致。例如四川个别地区售价比华北高约三倍，长沙比华北高约二倍。这种不平衡现象并不都是由于各地区印书成本高下不等。广州由新华书店联合当地私营书店组织教科书供应委员会，其所印教科书定价以银行折实储蓄单位计算，以致实售价每日更动。这更显然是为出版者的利润打算，全不从购用教科书的人的利益着想。长沙公私营书店联合印行教科书投资白报纸三千三百令，结算后获净利达六千令，为投资额的百分之一百八十。汉口、杭州、金华等地公私联营获利都在一倍以上，这种在教科书上逐取非法厚利的行为是完全错误的，决不能够拿没有经验或印刷时物价正波动，计算成本时预加物价上涨的损失，而收回书款时则物价跌落等等原因作为借口。各该地区的新华书店没有能在这工作上好好地领导私营书店，应该首先受到责备。同时，在另一方面，有些地方，又有新华书店拒绝和私营书店合作的现象。例如在重庆，新华书店未能组织私营书店参与春季教科书出版发行工作，以致一方面许多学校得不到新的教科书，一方面有六十余万册存书未能销出，这当然也是错误的做法。
    在检讨了今年春季教科书供应情形后，出版总署认为，本署过去对于各地工作，未能及时预为布置，也应当负责。由于秋季教科书供应工作即将开始，出版总署特与教育部会商，颁发了“中央人民政府教育部、出版总署关于一九五○年秋季中小学教科用书的决定”和“中央人民政府教育部、出版总署关于一九五○年秋季教科书减低并划一售价及供应办法的决定”两个文件，通知各地统一执行，一方面即是为了使各地中小学采用的课本逐渐趋向划一，一方面也是为了改善教科书的供应工作并合理地抑低书价以减轻学生负担。决定规定了秋季教科书的定价标准，使教科书售价在华北、华东、中南三个地区内首先统一，同时为防止对边远农村读者增加额外费用，在运费上也规定了全国范围内百分之五的统筹支付办法，不足部分由出版总署津贴。按照新的定价标准，今年秋季的教科书售价在各地区都会比今春相当降低，有的地区并且会降低很多。
    实行决定中的办法，对于条件特别困难的个别地方可能很吃力。而且由于中小学教科书的出版、发行是很复杂的工作，各地情况不同，也可能产生一些未及预料的困难。出版总署认为，实行这些决定对于全国一千七百万中小学生是有好处的，对于各地教育普及工作能起良好的配合作用，并且也有助于出版业公私关系的调整。因此，出版总署首先要求各地公营的、公私合营的教科书出版发行机构坚决实行这些决定，并且领导私营书店配合执行。如果遇到各种困难和问题，可以向上级请示协助解决。但决不允许借此拒绝执行这些决定。另一方面，各地公私营书业发售教科书，如有违反上项决定，不遵照书面所标货币价格出售的，或者在教科书发行工作上还有各种缺点和错误的，希望各地学校方面及各界人士随时向当地新闻出版局、新闻出版处报告，以便督促改进。
