　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The main bandit forces in the Northwest region, which were pre-arranged by the US imperialists in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek remnant bandit gang, have now been basically eliminated. These main bandit forces include the Usman and Yaolebos bandit troops who were directly under the command of the US imperialist secret service and roamed eastern Xinjiang, the Demuchukepulu (i.e., the so-called "De Wang") and Li Shouxin bandit troops who roamed the Alxa and Ejina banners of Ningxia, the habitual bandit Zhang Tingzhi troops who harassed Tongxin and Helan Mountain areas of Ningxia, the Hu Zongnan remnant bandit Wen Daosheng troops who attempted to rely on Bashan to establish a so-called "guerrilla base" in southern Shaanxi, and the Ma Bufang and Ma Hongkui remnants who repeatedly stirred up trouble in the ethnic minority areas of Qinghai and Gansu. According to preliminary statistics, as of June this year, the achievements of the People's Liberation Army Northwest Military Region in bandit suppression, including the annihilation of the above-mentioned main bandit forces, amounted to the annihilation of more than 56,000 bandits in half a year, including more than 3,800 bandit leaders such as Ma Ying (killed), more than 24,700 bandits captured including the puppet "Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Henan-Hubei Pacification Headquarters" Wang Lingyun and habitual bandit Tie Xiaoge, and more than 28,300 bandits including Sun Minghai, deputy commander of the First Division of the Demuchukepulu and Li Shouxin bandit troops, Qin Fengming, and Jilizhantai, commander of the Second Division, and Tabala, deputy commander, who surrendered to our side. Our army seized a total of 68 various artillery pieces, 400 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 8,700 various guns.
　　Currently, there are still some remnant bandits roaming in the mountainous areas bordering various provinces and some ethnic minority areas. The bandit suppression troops in various places are continuing to vigorously suppress them with the assistance of the local people's governments and people of all ethnic groups.
　　One of the major characteristics of the bandit situation in the Northwest region is that the bandits in various places used the ethnic divisions and hatred caused by the reactionary rule of previous dynasties to provoke ethnic relations and incite and coerce some backward masses to engage in riots. In response to the above situation, the bandit suppression work in the Northwest region adopted the policy of "giving equal importance to military affairs and political affairs, combining suppression and appeasement," especially in ethnic minority areas, focusing on carrying out political disintegration work, striving to win over the coerced masses, and concentrating superior forces to conduct continuous encirclement and suppression of bandit forces who are unrepentant and dare to resist stubbornly on the basis of mobilizing the masses of all ethnic groups. The bandit suppression troops in various places have conducted in-depth mobilization and education on ethnic policies, and in cooperation with the local organizations of the Chinese Communist Party and the local people's governments, organized armed work teams or work groups to conduct extensive propaganda in the bandit-active areas, explaining the various policies of the people's government and the domestic and international situation, exposing the rumors of bandits and secret agents, and carrying out persuasion and disintegration work within the bandits through various social relations. In the Hui and Han ethnic minority areas of Qinghai and Gansu, the People's Liberation Army, the People's Government, and the local committees of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the principles of ethnic equality, unity, and mutual assistance, organized Hui-Han unity committees, formulated mutual assistance covenants, and jointly prevented bandits. Due to our army's adoption of correct bandit suppression policies and correct implementation of ethnic policies, more than 15,000 members of over ten Kazakh tribes in Xinjiang who had been deceived and coerced by the Usman bandit gang were won over to the People's Government, isolating the Usman bandit forces and quickly annihilating most of the bandits. The riots of bandits and secret agents in various parts of Gansu in mid-May were also quickly quelled by us.

　　采取了“军政并重剿抚兼施”的正确方针
    西北区半年歼匪五万六千
    【本报讯】新华社电：美帝国主义勾结蒋介石残余匪帮在西北地区预布的主要股匪现已被基本肃清。这些主要股匪包括直接受美帝国主义特务机关指挥的在新疆东部窜扰的乌斯满、尧乐博斯匪部，流窜于宁夏阿拉善、额济纳两旗的德穆楚克普鲁（即所谓“德王”）、李守信匪部，骚扰宁夏同心及贺兰山区的惯匪张廷芝部，在陕西南部企图依托巴山建立所谓“游击基地”的胡宗南残匪温道生部以及在青海、甘肃民族杂居地区数度蠢动的马步芳、马鸿逵两残余匪部。据初步统计，截至今年六月，人民解放军西北军区所属各部的剿匪战绩，连同歼灭上述主要股匪在内，半年内已歼匪五万六千余众，毙伤匪首马英（毙）以下三千八百余人，俘匪伪“川陕豫鄂绥靖公署总指挥”王凌云及惯匪铁孝戈以下二万四千七百余人，并迫使德穆楚克普鲁、李守信匪部第一师副师长孙明海、秦凤鸣，第二师师长吉利占泰、副师长塔巴拉以下二万八千三百余人向我投诚。我军共缴获各种炮六十八门，轻重机枪四百挺，各种枪支八千七百余支。
    目前，尚有若干残余股匪流窜在各省交界边境的山区及部分民族杂居地区，各地剿匪部队正在当地人民政府和各族人民协助下继续大力清剿中。
    西北地区匪情的重大特点之一，是各地匪首利用历代反动统治造成的民族隔阂与仇视，挑拨民族关系，煽动和胁迫部分落后群众进行骚乱。针对上述情况，西北区的剿匪工作便采取了“军政并重，剿抚兼施”的方针，特别是在民族杂居地区，着重展开政治瓦解工作，争取胁从群众来归，对怙恶不悛和敢于顽抗的匪股，在发动各族群众的基础上，集中优势兵力，进行连续围剿。各地剿匪部队曾进行了深入的动员和民族政策的教育，配合中国共产党的地方组织和各地人民政府，组织武装工作队或工作组，在土匪活动地区进行广泛宣传，讲解人民政府各项政策及国内外形势，揭破土匪特务谣言，并通过各种社会关系，对土匪内部进行争取和瓦解工作。在青海及甘肃回汉民族杂居地区，解放军和人民政府以及中共地方党委依据民族平等、团结、互助原则，组织回汉团结委员会，订立互助公约，联合防匪。由于我军采取正确的剿匪方针，和正确执行了民族政策，争取了新疆的被乌斯满匪帮欺骗和胁迫的十余哈族部落一万五千余人归顺人民政府；孤立了乌斯满匪部，并将该匪迅速地大部剿灭。在五月中旬甘肃各地土匪特务的暴乱活动，也被我迅速平息。
