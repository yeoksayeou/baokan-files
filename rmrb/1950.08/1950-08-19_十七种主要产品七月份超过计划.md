Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th - In July, among the 33 major products produced by state-owned factories and mines in Northeast China, 17 completed and exceeded their planned targets. Electrolytic aluminum saw the biggest overachievement, reaching 172% of the original plan. Ball bearings came in second, exceeding the plan by 29.2%. The remaining 16 products did not meet their planned targets, largely due to mechanical repairs or proactive production cuts. For example, the production of conveyor belts and transmission belts was above 20% in the first half of the year, so mechanical repairs were carried out in July, and only about 70% to 80% of the plan was completed. Another example is raw coal, where the state decided to reduce production based on needs, so only 86.6% of the plan was completed.
    A better situation in July than in the first half of the year was that the worker attendance rate increased by 2.5%. The total average reached 93.1%.

　　十七种主要产品七月份超过计划
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】七月份东北国营工矿生产的三十三种主要产品，有十七种完成并超过了计划。其中以电解铝完成最多，达原计划百分之一百七十二。滚珠轴承次之，超过计划百分之二十九点二。另有十六种产品未完成计划，大部是进行机械检修或主动减产所致。如运输皮带与传动带等产品因上半年已超过计划百分之二十以上，故在七月份进行了机械检修，只完成计划百分之七十至八十左右。又如原煤因国家根据需要情况决定减产，只完成计划百分之八十六点六。
    七月份有一个比过去为好的情况是工人出勤率比上半年提高了百分之二点五。总平均达到百分之九十三点一。
