　　Hunan After the Early Rice Harvest
    Luo Houren
    Vast Disaster Areas Turned into Fertile Fields
    This year, Hunan has had a bumper harvest of early rice, especially in the lakeside area known as the "Southwest Granary." Some places that used to have poor harvests in most of the last ten years, and where farmers suffered from floods for several years, have, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, repaired dikes and embankments with grain loans, overcome disasters, and turned the disaster areas that were once vast expanses of water into an endless ocean of golden rice waves.
    At present, the early rice in Changsha and other lakeside areas has almost been completely harvested. It is estimated that at least 90% of the crops have been harvested, with the lakeside area increasing production by double compared to last year. The countryside after the bumper harvest is filled with a new atmosphere. Farmers who have suffered from disasters and displacement for many years are now building new houses everywhere. The farmers are all overjoyed and smiling. They hang Chairman Mao's portrait high in their newly built main rooms. Seeing the fruits of their hard work, looking at Chairman Mao, and thinking about the past, the farmers cannot help but feel emotional. Ou Jialin, a farmer in Yiyang, said: "This area hasn't harvested any grain for several years. Last year, even the outhouse was washed away by the flood. This year, we are enjoying Chairman Mao's blessing. If the People's Government hadn't provided grain loans to repair the dikes, how could we have had this bumper harvest?"
    Slow-Moving Native Cloth Now Has a Market
    After the bumper harvest, the purchasing power of farmers has increased, and urban industry and commerce and trade between urban and rural areas have also become active. This is first reflected in the market. Farmers have to quickly dry a portion of the early rice to exchange for fertilizer, lime, add agricultural tools, prepare to plant late rice and welcome the autumn harvest, so a large number of new grains have flooded into the market. New grain entering the Changsha market in early August reached as high as seventy to eighty thousand dan a day, with more than one hundred thousand dan still in stock at the river docks, breaking the unprecedented record for grain and rice entering the Changsha market. The trading volume averages about 20,000 dan per day. The sales of industrial products such as salt, yarn, kerosene, and daily necessities have also greatly increased. For example, the Hunan Provincial Salt Industry Company's sales of edible salt in the province in July increased by more than 64,000 dan compared to June, with daily sales of salt reaching 3,000 dan. The sales of major commodities by private merchants in Changsha have also generally increased. Compared with June, sales of edible salt increased by 171%, cotton yarn increased by 87.48%, and kerosene increased by 11%. In addition, the blue cloth needed by farmers, which was previously slow-moving and caused serious difficulties for two or three hundred native cloth weaving and dyeing factories, is now in short supply. The daily sales of yarn by the cotton yarn and cloth company have also surged to more than 100 pieces.
    Government Vigorously Purchases to Stabilize Grain Prices
    In the early stage of the new grain entering the market, grain prices in various places once fell sharply, and the prices of individual daily necessities such as oil, salt, and cloth rose sharply due to the smooth sales. For example, in Changsha, the commodity exchange ratio in late May was one piece of 20-count yarn for 6.371 jin of rice, and one dan of Huai salt for 218 jin of rice. By early August, the grain price had fallen to 320 yuan per jin, one piece of 20-count yarn could be exchanged for 10.994 jin of rice, and one dan of edible salt could be exchanged for 249 jin of rice. According to farmers in Binhu County, before the new grain entered the market, one jin of high-quality salt could be exchanged for one and a half sheng of rice, and one jin of vegetable oil could be exchanged for two and a half sheng of rice. After the new grain entered the market, the price of salt rose to three sheng of rice per jin, and vegetable oil had to be exchanged for eight sheng of rice. At that time, farmers who transported grain to the city for sale were frowning because of the falling grain prices.
    After the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce discovered the sharp drop in grain prices, in order to prevent low grain prices from harming farmers and affecting future production, it immediately notified the grain company and various counties in Binhu to accurately grasp the price policy and intensify the purchase work. The Changsha Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce also issued a notice allowing rice merchants to transport grain for sale outside the city. The Grain Company and Trust Company mobilized all manpower to intensify purchases to avoid congestion of grain ships and difficulty in diversion; and to prevent farmers who were eager to sell new grain from suffering losses due to price cuts by unscrupulous merchants. Since the active expansion of purchasing work in various places, grain prices have generally tended to stabilize, and although transactions in various places are booming, most sellers no longer feel panicked. A farmer in Changde said: "In the past months, the government ran a fair price sale, provided grain loans to repair dikes to overcome the famine; this month, the government purchases grain, and grain prices do not fall, always thinking of the people. In the past, when doing business with grain firms, they discounted money at a rate of 37.5, deducted weight by 5%, and we still lost a lot on the price."
    Urban and Rural Material Exchanges Tend to Be Active
    In order to fully supply farmers with industrial products at reasonable prices after selling new grain, the state-owned trading companies, in addition to transporting large quantities of oil, salt, and general merchandise to rural areas, also organized private merchants or organized hawkers through farmers' associations to go to the countryside to promote sales, and the trading companies gave a certain profit on prices. At the same time, the People's Bank also organized currency to go to the countryside, combined with the collection and exchange of gold and silver yuan, and issued loans to support the export of local products to solve the rural financial difficulties and promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. The increasing activity of urban and rural trade can also be seen from the highway freight. According to statistics, the highway transportation volume in July reached 1.1 million tons, an increase of seven times compared with May. The goods transported out included more than 1,000 tons of tung oil, 17.28 million jin of rice, and more than 800,000 jin of rice. Local products are the main exports. For example, the volume of material exports from Shaoyang in June increased tenfold compared with March, of which local products accounted for 88%. The 134 private cars in Shaoyang are deeply insufficient.
    Because the state-owned trading companies correctly grasped the price policy, maintained the normal state of the difference between industrial and agricultural products, promoted the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and united and encouraged private industrial and commercial enterprises to face the countryside, private industrial and commercial enterprises also tended to recover. For example, in Changsha, only 40 industrial and commercial households closed down in July, and 168 opened, with the ratio of openings to closures being four to one. The number of vegetable oil exporters in Changsha increased from four to eleven; the number of pig bristle companies in Xiangtan increased from thirty to more than seventy; and the number of paper umbrella companies in Yiyang developed from dozens to 176.
    Intensify Preparations to Welcome the Autumn Harvest
    Due to the bumper harvest of early rice and the upcoming autumn harvest, urban and rural trade in Hunan has faced a new situation. State-owned trade should pay special attention to the following tasks:
    First, intensify preparations to welcome the autumn harvest: The bumper harvest of early rice this year has increased the purchasing power of farmers compared with previous years. They urgently need to exchange the harvested grain for fertilizer, add agricultural tools and all daily necessities, so the amount of new grain entering the market in various places this year has exceeded several times that of previous years, but some trade cadres have not fully estimated this year's bumper harvest and the needs of farmers in their thinking, and have not made sufficient preparations in advance, resulting in prices plummeting once the new grain poured in, and the work once appeared very flustered. With the arrival of the autumn harvest, grain will pour in in larger quantities. How state-owned trade prepares to purchase and unite private merchants for appropriate purchases, correctly grasps the price policy, strengthens work planning, and fully prepares the materials needed by farmers to supply the countryside is an urgent and serious task.
    Second, prepare warehouses: According to past experiences and lessons, when purchasing food grains, most of them are stored in private warehouses due to insufficient warehouse equipment. Sometimes, private merchants move them away and sell them secretly, and some even buy blank checks, resulting in serious losses to state and people's property. This kind of situation has been found in many counties such as Changsha and Yuanling. After the autumn harvest this year, the purchase, autumn collection, recovery of agricultural loans, warehouses and storage issues must be resolved quickly.
    Third, the purchase quality must pay attention to inspection: Most of the early grain arriving in port this time is wet, only 60% to 70% dry, which makes it difficult to store and manage, but we cannot hold the idea of "being afraid that new grain is not easy to store" and not buy it, nor can we "buy grain when we see it." In addition to restricting and improving the purchase price by grading it according to quality, we must also persuade farmers to dry the grain and transport it to the city through newspapers, especially through extensive publicity and explanation by township cadres.
    Editor's note: In order to welcome the autumn harvest, to prevent the difference between industrial and agricultural product exchanges from becoming too large, and to take good care of the new grain so that state property does not suffer unnecessary losses, not only should Hunan's state-owned trade departments intensify preparations for the above three tasks, but state-owned trade departments throughout the country should also intensify preparations.

　　早稻丰收后的湖南
    罗厚仁
    汪洋的灾区变成了良田
    今年湖南早稻丰收，特别是号称“西南米仓”的滨湖区域，有些十年九不收的地方，农民遭受了几年的水灾，今年在共产党和人民政府领导之下，贷粮修好了堤垸，战胜了灾荒，把往年一片汪洋的灾区，变成了一望无涯金黄稻浪的海洋了。
    现长沙及滨湖各地的早稻差不多已全部收割，据估计至少有九成以上的收成，滨湖较去年增产一倍。丰收后的农村，充满了一片新的气象。农民连年遭受灾荒，流离失所，现在到处都盖起新房子来了。农民们一个个欢天喜地，笑逐颜开。他们把毛主席的像，高高悬挂在新建的堂屋里。农民看到自己辛勤收获的果实，望望毛主席，想到过去，不禁感慨起来。益阳农民欧家林说：“这块地方，几年没收得谷，去年连茅房都被大水冲走了，今年享毛主席的福，不是人民政府贷粮修堤，那有这个丰收？”
    滞销的土布也有了销路
    丰收后的农民，购买力加强，城市工商业与城乡贸易也随着活跃起来了，首先是表现在市场方面。农民都要将早稻赶紧晒干一部分，去换肥料、石灰，添置农具，准备种晚稻和迎接秋收，因而大批新谷皆涌入市场。长沙市场八月初的新谷上市，最高一天曾达七、八万担，河下尚积货十余万担，突破长沙谷米上市的空前纪录，成交量每天平均有二万担左右。工业品的盐、纱布、煤油、日用品等销货额亦随之大大增加，如湖南省盐业公司七月份全省食盐销货额较六月增加六万四千余担，每日销盐达三千担。长沙市私商主要商品销货额亦普遍增多，以七月与六月份比较，食盐增加百分之一百七十一，棉纱增百分之八十七点四八，煤油增百分之十一。此外，如农民所需要的青布，过去滞销，两三百家土布织染厂商因而遭遇严重的困难，现在产品却供不应求。花纱布公司销纱量每日亦激增至一百余件。
    政府大力收购，稳定谷价
    在新谷登场初期，各地谷价曾经急剧下落，个别地区的日用品如油、盐、布则因销路转畅，呈猛涨现象。如长沙在五月下旬商品交换比率是一件二十支纱换大米六、三七一斤，淮盐一担换米二一八斤，至八月上旬，谷价每斤落至三二○元，一件二十支纱可换米一○、九九四斤，食盐一担换米二四九斤。据滨湖县农民反映：他们在新谷米上市前，上等盐每斤换一升半米，菜油每斤换米二升半，新谷上市后，盐每斤涨至换米三升，菜油要换米八升。当时乡下运谷来城求售的农民，眼见谷价下落，都显得愁眉苦脸。
    湖南省商业厅发现谷价猛落现象后，为防止谷贱伤农，影响今后生产，立即通知粮食公司及滨湖各县，正确掌握价格政策，加紧展开收购工作。长沙市工商局亦发出准许米商运谷外销的通告。粮食公司和信托公司则动员全部人力加紧收购，以免粮船麇集，疏导困难；并使急于脱售新谷的农民，免受奸商压价的损失。自各地积极展开收购工作后，粮价全面趋于稳定，各地交易虽然畅旺，但一般卖主已不感恐慌了。常德农民说：“陈月，政府办平粜，贷粮修堤度荒；新月，政府收购，谷价不跌，处处为人民着想。往年和粮行做生意，三七五兑钱，九五扣秤，价钱还不知吃多少亏。”
    城乡物资交流趋活跃
    为了充分供应农民在出售新谷后能以合理代价购回工业品，与收购同时，各国营贸易公司除了本身以大批油、盐、百货等，源源运往农村外，并组织私商或通过农会组织小贩下乡推销，贸易公司在价格上给予一定的利润。同时人民银行也组织货币下乡，结合进行收兑黄金银元，并发放贷款扶助土产外销，以解决农村资金困难，促进城乡内外物资交流。再从公路货运方面，亦可看出城乡贸易日趋活跃。据统计，七月份公路运输量达一百一十万吨，较五月份增加七倍。运出物资包括桐油千余吨，稻谷一、七二八万斤，米八十余万斤。土产是输出大宗，如邵阳六月份物资输出量较三月份增加十倍，其中土产占百分之八十八，邵阳的一三四辆民营汽车，已深感不够支配。
    由于国营贸易公司正确掌握了价格政策，使工农业品间的差额保持了正常状态，促进了城乡物资的交流，并团结、鼓舞私营工商业面向农村，因此，私营工商业亦趋复苏。如长沙市工商业户，七月份歇业仅四十家，开业的达一百六十八家，开业与歇业比较是四比一。长沙植物油出口业由四家增至十一家；湘潭猪鬃业由三十家增至七十余家，益阳纸伞业由几十家发展至一七六家。
    加紧准备迎接秋收
    由于早稻的丰收和即将来到的秋收，湖南城乡贸易已面临一个新的局面，国营贸易方面还应特别注意以下几件工作：
    第一，加紧准备，迎接秋收：今年早稻的丰收使农民购买力较往年提高，他们急需将收获的谷子换购肥料，添置农具及一切日用品，所以今年各地新谷上市超过往年几倍，但部分贸易干部思想上对今年的丰收和农民的需要估计不足，事前未作充分准备，致一旦新谷涌到，价格狂泻，工作上曾一度表现得很慌乱。秋收到来，粮食将更会大批涌到，国营贸易如何准备收购并团结私商适当收购，正确掌握价格政策，加强工作计划性，充分准备农民需要的物资供给农村，这是一个迫切而严重的任务。
    第二，准备仓库：根据以往经验教训，一般收购食粮，因仓库设备不够，大部分寄存私人仓库，有时为私商挪空盗卖，甚至有些买的是空头或白条子，以致国家人民财产，受到严重的损失。这类情形，在长沙、沅陵各县发现不少。今年秋收后，要收购、秋征、收回农贷、仓库及保管问题，必须迅速解决。
    第三，收购品质须注意检验：这次到埠早谷大部分潮湿，只有六、七成干，这对收仓保管有困难，但也不能抱“怕新谷不易保管”便不收，也不能“见谷就购”，除收购价格按成色分级定出高低予以限制改进外，还须通过报纸、特别是在乡干部多方宣传解释，劝导农民必须将谷晒干运进城来。
    编者按：为了迎接秋收，使工农业产品交换差额不致过于扩大，为了保管好新粮，不使国家财产受到不必要的损失，不仅湖南国营贸易部门应加紧准备以上三件工作，全国各地国营贸易部门亦应加紧准备。
