　　People's Hero Yang Lianxiu
　　Zhang Shanyou
    Yang Lianxiu, the machine gun and artillery company commander of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tangshan, is a first-class model worker of the Red May Labor Model Conference held in Tangshan City this August, and he is also a first-class combat hero of the former Jidong Military Region.

    After joining the Jidong Local Corps in 1947, Yang Lianxiu has been fighting inside and outside the Great Wall.

    The cold wind outside the Great Wall rolls with snowflakes, and the top of the high mountain cannot be seen at a glance. Yang Lianxiu and his comrades often fought in the "no-man's land" created by the enemy. When the Kuomintang bandit army was struggling to death, the masses on the Pingquan-Chengde line suffered severe burning, killing, and looting. They waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against the enemy to defend the spring plowing and autumn harvest in the new district.

    When the seasons changed between spring and summer, the grain hidden by the mountain people was robbed by the Kuomintang bandits. The People's Liberation Army shared the hardships with the people who had no clothes or food, using green tree leaves and tree bark flour to satisfy their hunger, while also fighting. Company Commander Yang once went hungry, carried a machine gun with his soldiers, and insisted on fighting six battles while sick. Crossing mountains and wading through rivers, enduring hunger, and overcoming various difficulties, he cooperated with the Northeast Army to liberate the suffering people outside the Great Wall.

    At that time, a story was circulating among the people in the Jire Border area inside and outside the Great Wall: The People's Liberation Army's heavy machine gun fired three bursts in a row, as if asking the enemy: "Are you afraid?" "Afraid, afraid, afraid!" The American heavy machine guns used by the Chiang bandits replied. Yang Lianxiu not only fired bursts from the heavy machine gun, but was also good at using the heavy machine gun to single out enemies with single shots. In the Battle of Longxumen, the enemy bared its fangs and claws and pounced on our position. Yang Lianxiu knocked down four or five enemies with a burst from his heavy machine gun. The enemy was in chaos, and the heavy machine gun sounded again "Are you afraid? Are you afraid?", annihilating more than eighty bandits in a row. His heavy machine gun also played a major role in battles such as Yingshouyingzi and Daxiaoshibapan. This is the result of Yang Lianxiu's hard training and willingness to study shooting techniques. In every battle, with Yang Lianxiu's "Type 92" heavy machine gun, the soldiers were more confident of victory. Therefore, at the Second Congress of Heroes of the Jidong Military Region, Yang Lianxiu was selected as a special shooter - a first-class combat hero.

    After Chairman Mao issued instructions on the army's participation in production and construction work in 1950, Yang Lianxiu actively responded. He made a plan at the cadre meeting: strive to be a labor model. In March of this year, the troops entered the banks of the Luan River, shouldering the glorious task of repairing the river堤.

    "Carry one more basket of soil, and the people of Luannan will suffer less." This is the people's wish and the will of revolutionary soldiers. As soon as the starting whistle sounded every day, the soldiers shouted in unison: "Strive for the first basket!" The river堤 was filled with the soldiers' cheerful songs. In addition to carrying soil basket by basket and load by load with the soldiers, hero Yang Lianxiu also took time to study dike-repairing techniques and inspect the quality of dike repair. Whenever he discovered a new working method, he quickly and widely promoted it. When he found out that soldiers Sun Ting and Chen Liyi were working while sick, he used orders to stop them from working after everyone's dissuasion. He explained to the whole company the principle of "production should be planned for the long term," and everyone was deeply moved. Some said: "Winning battles in combat, carrying big baskets in dike repair, caring about everyone's food; taking care of sick soldiers. We will never forget Company Commander Yang!" After hearing this, Comrade Yang Lianxiu said: "The revolutionary team is a big family; it shouldn't be about not forgetting the company commander, it should be about not forgetting the revolution!" The relationship between officers and soldiers in the company was so harmonious, united, respectful, and loving. Under his leadership, the soldiers displayed their creativity, digging up tree bark from the soil of the river堤 and twisting it together to use as rope, saving public expenses. His company's digging rate averaged more than six cubic meters of soil per person, creating the highest record in the upper section of the Luan River project. After the river堤 was completed, it was inspected and evaluated, and the company's repair was the most solid, and it also united and befriended the neighboring troops the best. Therefore, not only did two model platoons and many heroes and models (including Yang Lianxiu, who was the first model) emerge from the company, but it also won the award of "Dike-Building Model Company."

    Company Commander Yang also works very hard to study culture. He signed a contract with the cultural instructor to ensure teaching and learning, and studied culture earnestly. When he had time on the river堤, he used his fingers to draw on the ground, recited along the way back to the team after work, and took time to study mathematics in the evening. Under his influence, the soldiers also actively started studying, creating a wave of cultural learning throughout the company. During the dike repair, the whole company had already recognized more than 200 characters. Company Commander Yang's arithmetic level has reached the level of higher primary school, and he said happily: "It will be more convenient to use heavy machine guns and artillery in the future, and it will be more reliable to measure and observe distances and calculate with mathematics."

　　人民的英雄杨连秀
　　张善友
    人民解放军驻唐山某部机炮连长杨连秀，是今年八月唐山市召开的红五月竞赛劳动模范大会的甲等模范，他又是前冀东军区的甲等战斗英雄。
    杨连秀在一九四七年参加冀东地方兵团后，就一直战斗在长城内外。
    塞外的寒风卷着雪花，一眼看不到高山顶。杨连秀与他的战友们，经常战斗在敌人造成的“无人区”。在国民党匪军进行垂死挣扎的时候，平（泉）承（德）线上的群众遭受到严重的烧杀抢掠，他们为保卫新区的春耕和秋收，对敌人进行了英勇顽强的斗争。
    当春夏青黄不接的时候，山地人民藏粮被国民党匪帮抢劫一空。解放军即与无衣无食的人民同甘苦，拿青树叶煮树皮面来充饥，同时还要进行战斗。杨连长曾饿着肚皮，与战士一同扛着机枪，带病坚持过六次战斗。翻岭涉水，忍受饥饿，克服了种种困难，配合东北大军解放了塞外受苦人民。
    当时在长城内外冀热边界的人民中间，传流着这样一个故事：解放军的重机枪三声连发，就像问敌人：“怕不怕？”“怕怕怕！”蒋匪军用的美式重机枪这样回答。杨连秀打重机枪不光打连发，还善于用重机枪点名打单发。龙须门战斗中，敌人张牙舞爪地向我阵地扑来，杨连秀重机枪一梭子，就打倒了四五个敌人。敌人乱了，重机枪又“怕不怕、怕不怕”地响了起来，一连歼灭了八十多个匪军。鹰守营子、大小十八盘等战斗中，他的重机枪也都起了重大作用。这是杨连秀平时苦练，肯钻研射击技术的结果。每次战斗中，有了杨连秀的“九二”重机枪，战士们就更增加了胜利信心。因此，在冀东军区第二届群英大会上，杨连秀就被选为特等射手——甲等战斗英雄。
    毛主席关于一九五○年军队参加生产建设工作的指示发表后，杨连秀就积极响应，他在干部会上订出计划：争取做个劳动模范。今年三月间，队伍开入滦河畔，担负着修河堤的光荣任务。
    “多抬一筐土，滦南人民少受苦。”这是人民的愿望，革命战士的意志。每天开工号一响，战士们就不约而同地嚷起来：“争取第一筐！”河堤上到处洋溢着战士们愉快的歌声。英雄杨连秀除了与战士们一筐筐、一担担地抬土外，还抽空钻研修堤技术，检查修堤质量。每当他一发现新的工作方法，他就迅速普遍的推广。当他发现战士孙庭、陈立义带病劳动，经大家劝阻仍然不听，就用命令制止了他俩劳动。他给全连讲“生产要为长期打算”的道理，大家很受感动。有的说：“战斗中打胜仗，修堤中抬大筐，关心大家伙食；照顾病号。我们永远忘不了杨连长！”杨连秀同志听到后，说：“革命的队伍，就是大家庭；不是忘不了连长，应该是忘不了革命！”连里的官兵关系，是那样融洽、团结、互尊互爱。在他的领导下，战士们发挥了创造性，从河堤土里挖出树皮，拧在一块当绳子用，节约了公家开支。他连的挖土率每人平均六方余土，创造了滦河上段工的最高纪录。河堤修竣后，经过检查评定，该连修的最坚固，团结友邻部队也最好。因此，该连不但出现了两个模范班和许多英雄、模范（其中杨连秀就是模范第一名），还荣获了“筑堤模范连”的奖状。
    杨连长学习文化也很努力。他与文化教员订了包教保学合同，认真学文化。他在河堤上有空时就用手指在地下划，在收工回队途中用嘴念，晚上抽空学数学。在他的影响下，战士们也积极学习起来，造成全连学文化热潮。在修堤中，全连都已经认识了二百字以上。杨连长的算术程度已达到高小程度，他高兴地说：“以后使重机枪、大炮更加方便了，测量、观察距离，用数学计算更有把握了。”
