Xinhua News Agency, August 24th: TASS, New York, August 23rd: The Security Council continued its discussion of the Korean issue on August 22nd. Council President Malik presided over the meeting.

　　Malik, speaking first as the Soviet representative, stated that he wished to respond to the statement made by the U.S. representative at the last meeting of the Security Council. Malik declared that the discussion of the Korean issue in the Security Council clearly demonstrates that the representatives of the American bloc do not want a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue. He pointed out that since the Soviet Union proposed a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, and requested that representatives of the Korean people be invited to attend the Security Council during the discussion of the Korean issue, the representatives of the American bloc have consistently refused to invite representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, instead wanting to only invite representatives of the Syngman Rhee regime.

　　Malik pointed out that the representatives of the American bloc do not talk about the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, do not talk about the barbaric bombing of Korea by American aircraft and the shocking destruction suffered by Korea, and also avoid talking about the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's protest against the bombing. But the Security Council must immediately consider and resolve these pressing issues.

　　Malik emphasized that the armed intervention in Korea by the American armed forces under the command of Truman and MacArthur cannot be disguised with the signboard of the "United Nations". In international law and the rules of international relations, the principle of non-interference is paramount and has been accepted by all governments. The clear definition of aggression is the aggression of one country against another, and no one considers civil war to be aggression. Some governments brazenly violate international law and practice, and send troops to fight Koreans, only these governments are the governments that are aggressing against Korea. But no matter how international law is distorted, no matter how facts are distorted, it cannot cover up the American aggression in Korea, which is a direct act of aggression by those ruling groups who use the Truman Doctrine to suppress and enslave the people of other countries.

　　Malik further pointed out that MacArthur is striving to send more troops to Korea, and pointed out that the three major imperialist countries of Britain, France, and the Netherlands have agreed to send such troops there. This proves that the American ruling group and the ruling groups of other countries have openly invaded the peoples of Asian countries, but still want to use the banner of the United Nations to disguise it. This aggression is nothing more than a colonial war against the peoples of Asian countries. Even the newspapers of the American ruling class do not attempt to describe the characteristics of the Korean situation as a "police action", but call it a war.

　　Malik pointed out that the only thing the U.S. representative to the Security Council has done is to gather his majority vote in the Security Council to support the U.S. aggression against Korea. The Security Council's illegal actions in Korea have been endorsed by the fifty-three countries participating in this aggression, but this number is incorrect. In reality, only one country supports U.S. actions in Korea - Britain. Several other countries will send perhaps hundreds of troops to Korea to participate in this despicable war. However, this cannot obscure the fact that the United States is attempting to continue imperialist aggression against the Asian people. The United States is establishing "colonial institutions" aimed at enslaving the Asian people. It is clear that the ruling groups are trying to maintain their oppression of the colonial people.

　　Malik pointed out that the United States has obtained huge profits from the countries of the Far East, which is one reason why the impoverished people of Asia have been unable to develop and have stagnated.

　　Malik compared the situation of the oppressed Asian countries with the people of the Uzbek and Turkmen Republics. He listed the economic, educational and cultural achievements of the people of this republic since the Great October Revolution of 1917.

　　Malik pointed out that the U.S. representative is appealing to the Security Council's illegal decisions, but the United States is avoiding the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference's legal decision to establish a unified Korean state. The United States is trying to prove that "free elections" were held in South Korea, but what everyone knows is that the Syngman Rhee regime was forcibly imposed on the Korean people.

　　Malik pointed out that when the sun of freedom and liberation began to shine on Korea after Japan's surrender, he pointed out the land reform and the growth of education, science and culture in North Korea. The situation in South Korea is completely opposite. In South Korea, Syngman Rhee, under the protection of American bayonets, began to turn the country into an American colony, suppressing the freedom of the people and arresting thousands of patriotic elements.

　　Malik said that the United States attempted to make Korea a market for American-made goods and implemented a policy of de-industrializing Korea. In the poverty-stricken South Korean agriculture, 80 percent of the farmers had no land and worked like serfs. Unemployment and illiteracy increased, and the rich Korean culture gradually disappeared. The result of this anti-people policy of the United States made the people of South Korea feel that their situation was worse than under Japanese rule.

　　Malik pointed out that the terror regime in South Korea cannot eliminate the democratic will of the people, who, together with the North Koreans, elected representatives to the Supreme People's Assembly. The South Korean people do not support the Syngman Rhee regime, and have been conducting activities against American monopoly capitalists from the very beginning.

　　Malik said that the Korean War has become a national war for the liberation of the Korean people. The United States intends to expand the war against the Korean people and place the entire Korean country (not just South Korea) under the rule of American monopoly capitalists and fascist leaders. The U.S. armed forces deliberately bombed the industrialized areas of North Korea. The United States is unwilling to give up its broad powers of domination in Korea, but no people of any country are willing to live under such domination. The Security Council should no longer cover up the actions of the United States and call them actions of the "United Nations". The Security Council should make it possible for the Korean people themselves to decide their own destiny. The Security Council should listen to appeals from both sides.

　　Malik declared that we should not allow the United States to carry out aggressive colonial actions against the people of Korea, China, Vietnam, and other countries in the Far East under the mask. The people of Europe are condemning U.S. actions in Korea; the organizations of the United Nations receive many telegrams every day expressing this true public opinion of the people of the world. Unless the United States ceases its aggression against the people of Korea and Asian countries, all talk about the freedom of the people is nothing but a mask.

　　Malik concluded that only the withdrawal of troops can end the bloody aggression of the United States and achieve a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue.

　　After Malik spoke, British representative Jebb spoke, asserting that Malik had created a "dead end" situation in the Security Council because representatives of the Syngman Rhee group had not been invited to attend the Security Council meetings.

　　In his lengthy speech, Jebb attempted to prove that there was no Korean civil war.

　　Then Jebb tried to confirm his position, saying long and short, he refused to invite representatives of the Korean people to attend the Security Council meeting, and then talked about the philosophy of Marxism.

　　Following Jebb, U.S. representative Austin spoke, and he rudely opposed the Soviet Union's suggestion to invite representatives of North Korea to attend the Security Council.

　　Austin tried hard to praise the policies implemented by the United States in South Korea.

　　After Austin spoke, the Council adjourned and will reconvene on August 25.

### 安理会继续讨论朝鲜问题  马立克斥美国公开侵略亚洲人民  主张安理会应迅速制止美国的殖民战争

　　安理会继续讨论朝鲜问题
    马立克斥美国公开侵略亚洲人民
    主张安理会应迅速制止美国的殖民战争
    【新华社二十四日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：安全理事会在八月二十二日继续讨论朝鲜问题。理事会主席马立克主持会议。
    马立克首先以苏联代表身份发言称：他愿答复美国代表在安理会上次会议中所作的声明。马立克宣称：安理会中对于朝鲜问题的讨论，很清楚地说明了美国集团的代表们并不希望和平解决朝鲜问题。他指出：自从苏联提出建议，要求和平解决朝鲜问题，要求在讨论朝鲜问题时邀请朝鲜人民的代表出席安理会以来，美国集团的代表一直拒绝邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表，而要只邀请李承晚政权的代表。
    马立克指出：美国集团的代表不谈从朝鲜撤退外国军队，不谈美国飞机的野蛮轰炸及朝鲜所遭受的惊人破坏，而对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国抗议轰炸一事也避而不谈。但安理会必须立即考虑并解决这些迫不及待的问题。
    马立克强调说：美国武装部队在杜鲁门及麦克阿瑟的指挥下对朝鲜进行武装干涉，不是用“联合国”的招牌掩饰得了的。在国际法及国际关系的规则上，不干涉的原则是至高无上的，而且已为一切政府所接受。侵略的明确界说是一国对另一国的侵略，没有任何人认为内战是侵略。有些政府蛮横地违反国际法与惯例，竟派兵去打朝鲜人，只有这些政府才是侵略朝鲜的政府。但不论怎样曲解国际法，怎样歪曲事实，都不能掩盖美国在朝鲜的侵略，这是那些用杜鲁门主义来镇压和奴役他国人民的统治集团的直接侵略行动。
    马立克进一步指出麦克阿瑟力求加派军队去朝鲜，并指出英、法、荷三个首要帝国主义国家已答应派遣这种军队前往。这证明：美国统治集团及其他国家的统治集团已公开侵略亚洲各国人民，却还想用联合国的旗帜来加以掩饰。这种侵略只不过是对亚洲各国人民的殖民战争而已。甚至美国统治阶级的报纸也不企图将朝鲜局势的特点描写为“警察行动”，而称之为战争。
    马立克指出：美国驻安理会代表所作的唯一事情，就是集合他在安理会的多数票来拥护美国侵略朝鲜的行动。安理会对朝鲜的非法行动已为参加这次侵略的五十三国所赞成，但这数字是不正确的。实际支持美国在朝鲜的行动的，只有一个国家——英国。若干其他国家将派遣可能是数百名军队前往朝鲜，参加这一卑劣的战争。然而，这并不能掩蔽这一事实，即美国企图继续帝国主义的侵略，反对亚洲人民。美国正在建立旨在奴役亚洲人民的“殖民机构”。很明显地，统治集团力图维持他们对殖民地人民的压迫。
    马立克指出美国曾自远东各国获得巨额利润，这就是使亚洲贫困的人民不得发展和停滞不前的一个原因。
    马立克将被压迫的亚洲各国人民与乌兹贝克及土库曼共和国人民的情况作一对比。他列举出这个共和国的人民自从一九一七年伟大的十月革命以来在经济上、教育上和文化上的成就。
    马立克指出：美国代表向安理会的非法决定乞援，但是美国却对莫斯科外长会议关于建立统一的朝鲜国家的合法决定避而不谈。美国企图证明，南朝鲜曾举行“自由选举”，而大家知道的是，李承晚政权是硬栽在朝鲜人民头上的。
    马立克在宣称当日本投降以后自由和解放的阳光开始照耀朝鲜时，指出了北朝鲜的土地改革和教育、科学及文化的成长。南朝鲜的情景却与此完全相反，在南朝鲜，李承晚在美国刺刀的保护之下开始将该国变成美国的殖民地，镇压人民的自由并且拘捕了千万个爱国分子。
    马立克说：美国企图使朝鲜变成美国制成品的市场而实行使朝鲜非工业化的政策。在贫困所摧残的南朝鲜农业中，有百分之八十的农民没有土地，而且像农奴一样地工作着。失业和文盲增加了，而丰富的朝鲜文化也在逐渐消失。美国这种反人民政策的结果使南朝鲜人民感觉处境比在日本统治之下还坏。
    马立克指出，南朝鲜的恐怖政权消灭不了人民的民主意志，他们与北朝鲜人一同选举最高人民会议的代表。南朝鲜人民并不拥护李承晚政权，并且从最初就一直进行着反对美国垄断资本家的活动。
    马立克说：朝鲜战争已经变成朝鲜人民争取解放的全民战争，美国意欲扩大反朝鲜人民的战争，将朝鲜全国（而不只是南朝鲜）置于美国垄断资本家和法西斯头子的统治之下。美国武装部队故意轰炸北朝鲜工业发达的地区，美国不肯放弃在朝鲜的广泛统治大权，但是却没有那一国人民愿意在这种统治之下生活。安理会应该不再替美国的行动作掩护，而称之为“联合国”的行动，安理会应该使朝鲜人民自己有可能来决定他们的命运。安理会应该听取两方的申诉。
    马立克声称：我们应该不准美国在假面具下对朝鲜、中国、越南及远东其他各国人民进行侵略性的殖民行动。欧洲人民都在痛斥美国在朝鲜的行动；联合国所属各组织每天都收到许多封表示世界各国人民这种真正舆论的电报。除非美国中止它对朝鲜和亚洲各国人民的侵略行动，一切关于人民自由之类的说法都不过是假面具而已。
    马立克在结语中称，只有撤退军队才能结束美国的血腥侵略，才能使朝鲜问题达到和平解决。
    在马立克发言以后，英国代表杰伯发言时，断言马立克已在安理会中造成了“此路不通”的情况，因为李承晚集团的代表并没有被邀请来出席安全理事会的会议。
    杰伯在其冗长的发言中企图证明没有朝鲜内战存在的事实。
    接着杰伯又企图证实他的立场，说长说短都是拒绝邀请朝鲜人民代表出席安理会的会议，并且接着还讲到马克思主义的哲学。
    继杰伯以后，美国代表奥斯汀发言，他又无礼地反对苏联关于邀请北朝鲜代表出席安理会的建议。
    奥斯汀竭力赞颂美国在南朝鲜所举行的政策。
    奥斯汀发言以后，理事会即行休会，至八月二十五日再开会。
