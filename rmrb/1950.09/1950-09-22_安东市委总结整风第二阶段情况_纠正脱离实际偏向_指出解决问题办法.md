The AnDong Municipal Committee Summarizes the Second Stage of the Rectification Campaign: Correcting the Tendency to Separate from Reality and Pointing Out Solutions

[This Newspaper News] Since July, the rectification campaign in AnDong City, after studying documents and examining work, is currently focusing on resolving the main problems in the work. In the inspection work, in general, it is possible to make specific inspection plans according to the instructions of the provincial and municipal committees, and carry out inspections in a planned and step-by-step manner. Leading cadres of various units have also made enlightening speeches based on the implementation of the basic policies of their units and the problems in the central work. Some units have also convened symposiums of technical personnel, symposiums of non-party cadres, general meetings of party members, general meetings of workers, and various business meetings to listen to the opinions and criticisms of cadres and the masses on the work. Therefore, most of the main problems in the work have been exposed, so that each unit can conduct in-depth inspection and solve the main problems. However, the rectification of some units has some deviations. After being pointed out by the Municipal Party Committee, they are being corrected one after another. The most important ones are: First, instead of inspecting the main work, they are conducting general inspections and summarizing general work. As a result, the leadership is carrying out democracy without purpose or leadership, and everyone is blindly raising opinions without a center. Therefore, a lot of trivial matters of life were raised, and they were entangled with matters of principle, making it impossible to solve the problems. Even individual cadres verbally abused the leaders at the meeting. Second, instead of examining ideological style from the implementation of policies and work, they are isolating and abstractly rectifying ideology, style, and relations, resulting in worse and worse relations. Some factories initially made self-criticisms by the main cadres based on the current work, improving the relationship between the Party and the government and strengthening the unity of the cadres. However, without a center or purpose, they mobilized the Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League to raise opinions to each other, resulting in disagreements with each other.

The main reason for these deviations is that the leading cadres are not clear in their thinking and have not followed the instructions of the Northeast Bureau to carry out rectification in the production movement and the implementation of various policies. In addition, the Municipal Party Committee did not pay close attention to the leadership of the rectification movement during this period, and failed to discover and correct deviations in time. Everyone is accustomed to personal reflection and will not link personal reflection with checking the work.

Based on the current rectification situation in the city, the Municipal Party Committee put forward the following opinions: (1) The leaders of each unit should analyze and synthesize the problems and opinions that have been discovered, find the main problems, and propose solutions for everyone to discuss. This will prevent everyone from falling into disputes over trivial matters of life. (2) In-depth inspection and summary of work must closely combine bottom-up inspection with top-down inspection. This will facilitate distinguishing right from wrong, recognizing the crux of the problem, so as to find specific ways to improve work and improve leadership style. And through inspection work, establish a regular system of criticism and self-criticism, and establish a regular inspection system. (3) In connection with the central work, firmly grasp the organizational principles, and carry out criticism and self-criticism to improve the relationship between cadres and the relationship between the administration and the Party and the masses.

　　安东市委总结整风第二阶段情况
    纠正脱离实际偏向  指出解决问题办法
    【本报讯】七月份以来，安东市的整风运动，经过学习文件，检查工作，目前正在有重点的解决工作中的主要问题。在检查工作中，一般能够根据省、市委的指示，作出具体的检查计划，有计划有步骤地进行检查。各单位领导干部，并根据本单位基本政策执行情况及中心工作中的问题，作了启发性的发言。还有些单位召开了技术人员座谈会、非党干部座谈会、党员大会、工人大会，各种业务会议，听取干部群众对工作的意见与批评。因此工作中的主要问题大部已经暴露，使各单位可以深入的检查与解决主要问题。但是若干单位的整风，是存在着一些偏向的。经市委指出后正陆续纠正。其中最主要的是：一、不是检查主要工作，而是进行泛泛地检查与总结一般工作。结果领导上是无目的、无领导的发扬民主，大家是无中心的盲目的提意见。因此，生活琐事提了一大堆，与原则问题纠缠不清，使得问题无法解决。甚至发生了个别干部在会上谩骂领导的现象。二、不是从执行政策与工作中来检查思想作风，而是孤立地抽象地整思想整作风整关系，结果把关系愈整愈坏。有的厂最初由主要干部根据当前工作，以自我批评精神作了检讨，改进了党、政关系加强了干部团结。但又无中心无目的地发动党、政、工、团互相提意见，结果弄得互相闹意见。
    所以会发生这些偏向，最主要的是领导干部思想不明确，没有遵照东北局指示的在生产运动与贯彻各种政策中，来进行整风。此外，是市委这一时期对整风运动的领导抓的不紧，未及时发现偏向，进行纠正。大家又习惯于个人反省，不会从检查工作中来联系个人。
    根据目前全市整风情况，市委提出了以下意见：（一）各单位领导上应对已发现的问题和意见，进行分析综合，找出主要问题并提出解决办法，交给大家讨论。这样不致于使大家陷入生活琐事的争论中。（二）深入检查总结工作，必须把自下而上的检查与自上而下的检查密切结合起来。这样便于分清是非，认识问题的症结所在，以便找出改进工作、改进领导作风的具体办法。并通过检查工作，树立经常的批评与自我批评制度，建立经常的检查制度。（三）结合中心工作，抓紧组织原则，展开批评与自我批评，来搞好干部关系和行政与党群关系。
