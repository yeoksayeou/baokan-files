　　A Striking Contrast
　　Diéxī
　　The People's Daily reported on the 15th of this month: Just as Truman signed the wartime economic control bill, the Soviet Council of Ministers announced the decision to build the massive Turkmen Main Canal project, which will irrigate 1.3 million hectares of newly cultivated cotton fields and turn 7 million hectares of desert into fertile land. This is a striking contrast between socialist and imperialist countries, proving to the people of the world who are the instigators and creators of war, and who are the builders of the cause of peace.
　　"Facts speak louder than words" is an old saying, but it is always true. Malik's simple language can move the hearts of peace-loving people all over the world, while the saliva of the Austins can never wash away the blood of the Korean people on the United Nations flag stolen by the American aggressors. In the face of solemn facts, the shameless "Voice of America" is completely exposed.
　　American imperialism understands this. This is the basic reason why it fears peaceful competition. The greater the achievements of the Soviet Union and the new democracies in peaceful construction, the redder the eyes and the more panicked the heart of the American imperialism that relies on aggression for food, and the more frantic its actions become, in order to save its dying fate. However, the more frantic it becomes, the closer it gets to death!
　　As the situation develops to this day, the future of American imperialism is very clear. The roarings of Trumans and Achesons are actually nothing more than the dying sounds of apes and cranes.

　　鲜明的对照
    迭西
    本月十五日报载：正当杜鲁门签署战时经济管制法案的时候，苏联部长会议发布了开凿土库曼大运河的巨大建设工程的决定，将使一百三十万公顷新垦棉田获得灌溉，将使七百万公顷的沙漠变为良田。这是社会主义国家和帝国主义国家的鲜明对照，向全世界人民证明了谁是战争的挑拨者和制造者，谁是和平事业的建设者。
    “事实胜于雄辩”是一句老话了，然而永远是真理。马立克的朴素语言能够打动全世界爱好和平的人民的心坎，而奥斯汀之流的口沫却永远洗不了被美国侵略者所盗窃的联合国旗帜上的朝鲜人民的鲜血。在庄严的事实面前，无耻的“美国之音”妖形毕露了。
    美帝国主义是懂得这一点的。这就是它害怕和平竞赛的基本原因。苏联和各新民主主义国家和平建设的成绩越大，则靠侵略吃饭的美帝的眼睛越红，心越慌，行动就越发疯狂了，为了挽救其死亡的命运。然而它越疯狂，也越接近死亡！
    时势发展到今天，美帝的前途是很清楚了。杜鲁门、艾奇逊之流的咆哮，实际上不过是猿鸣鹤唳的尾声。
