(Report from the Lüda People's Daily) The CCP Lüda District Committee convened a rural work inspection meeting on August 7th and 8th, in accordance with the rectification plan. Seventy-nine people attended, including responsible comrades from the District Committee, various city and county committees, and relevant departments. At the meeting, a preliminary inspection of the implementation of several basic rural policies was carried out in a spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

(1) Regarding the issue of organizing and developing production: The meeting believed that after the First Party Congress of the Lüda District and the implementation of land adjustment throughout the district, this idea was established among the masses. Various cities and counties have rectified the past mutual aid teams that were designated or forcibly compiled by cadres. Due to the initial implementation of the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, allowing farmers the freedom to choose mutual aid or individual farming, farmers dared to develop production to make their lives prosperous. Therefore, a new atmosphere of vigorous agricultural production emerged in the countryside. Farmers in various places have added farming livestock and vehicles. In Lushun Tieshan District alone, 72 heads of farming livestock were added after land adjustment, and 15 vehicles were added in the central district after land adjustment. The basic problems in implementing the mutual aid policy at present are: the policy has not been fully explained. Although voluntariness has been emphasized, some still put forward incorrect slogans such as "no household or mu of land should not participate in mutual aid," or adopt coercive measures. On the other hand, some only emphasize voluntariness, resulting in laissez-faire, which led to the collapse of mutual aid teams due to a lack of leadership. There are also inappropriate wage rates in equal exchange.

(2) Regarding the issue of developing special crops and horticultural crops: The meeting believed that the main shortcomings in the past were: the tax and purchase policies lacked active encouragement for this, and the sales problem has not been resolved. There was a lack of technical guidance in assisting operations. This year, the peanut seeds lent to farmers in Lushun were shelled, but they were distributed to farmers without testing, resulting in a germination rate of only 50%. In addition, there was a lack of management of orchards. Generally, it was believed that public orchards did not need to be inspected, and private orchards were abandoned, resulting in some orchards being left barren. In the development of vegetable gardens, there was a lack of planning, and no plans were made based on the needs of the city in terms of variety and quantity, resulting in an imbalance between supply and demand, and fluctuating vegetable prices, causing farmers to suffer undue losses.

(3) Regarding the issue of agricultural loans: The meeting believed that great achievements have been made in supporting agricultural production over the past few years. The main problems at present are: in rural loan work, the focus on vigorously supporting the development of special crops and horticultural crops has not been grasped. At the same time, there are also phenomena of blindness and egalitarianism in distribution. During the spring plowing of 1949, farmers did not have much difficulty, but the bank still issued a large number of loans, and the remaining loans were not recovered, resulting in a phenomenon of apportionment. Last year's typhoon and falling prices created difficulties in recovery. Furthermore, due to the average apportionment, farmers who really needed loans did not receive the necessary assistance, while some workers and small merchants who were dispersed from the city to the countryside obtained too many loans. Due to the above situation, and the failure to properly grasp the issue of pre-purchasing agricultural product loans this year, and some in-kind loans being higher than market prices, farmers were overburdened with debt. Secondly, loans were not timely enough. Due to the lack of in-depth inspection by cadres, there have also been cases of embezzlement by a small number of cadres.

The problem with rural supply and marketing cooperatives is that they have failed to properly combine farmers' production and timely supply farmers with living and production materials, and have failed to organize and plan the purchase of agricultural products to connect the urban and rural economies through the ties and bridges of cooperatives. There is still a purely profit-oriented viewpoint and a fear of trouble in the work of cooperatives.

Regarding the production of fishing and salt industries, the main problem is the lack of unified leadership. After correcting the overly left-leaning phenomenon in the implementation of the labor-capital mutual benefit policy in the fishing areas in the past, there are now phenomena such as shipowners delaying wages and not allowing boatmen to join trade unions. Secondly, the sales of fish have not yet been resolved. Fisheries loans are not timely or are recovered too early, so fishermen dare not borrow.

In addition, regarding the issue of agricultural product purchases, the main shortcoming is that the purchase price is inappropriate, thus giving speculators room to maneuver.

On the issue of the people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas, there are still tendencies towards simple control or laissez-faire towards the control of landlords and former rich peasants. There is a lack of further unity with middle peasants and intellectuals.

On the issue of the ideological style of rural cadres, cadres lack a democratic style and are not good at using the strength of the masses. Therefore, the work style is simple, and there is a phenomenon of coercion and command. This is one of the important reasons why many guidelines and policies have not been well implemented.

Finally, Comrade Ouyang Qin, Secretary of the District Committee, spoke. He put forward many opinions on how to implement several basic rural policies, and particularly pointed out that the main shortcomings in the work style of Lüda's rural cadres at present are a lack of attention to investigation and research, a failure to go deep into the masses, a failure to proceed from reality, and coercion and command. In the future, in terms of leadership, we should especially strengthen the ideological and policy education of cadres, and emphasize going deep into work, linking with the masses, and seeking truth from facts.

After the meeting, the rural rectification throughout the district will be transferred to various rural cities and counties to further inspect and discuss according to the situation in each region.

　　中共旅大区党委召开农村工作检查会议
    检查农村政策执行情况
    【本报讯】据旅大人民日报消息：根据整风计划，中共旅大区党委于八月七、八两日召开农村工作检查会议。出席者有区党委、各市县委及各有关部门负责同志共七十九人。会上对农村工作几个基本政策的执行情况，以批评与自我批评的精神，进行了初步检查。
    （一）关于组织起来，发展生产的问题。会议认为在旅大区第一次党代表会及全区实行土地调剂后，即在群众中确立了这个思想，各市县都整顿了过去那些由干部指定或强迫编制的互助组。由于初步的贯彻自愿两利的原则，允许农民有选择互助或单干的自由，农民就敢于发展生产使自己生活走向富裕，在农村中因此出现了蓬蓬勃勃发展农业生产的新气象。各地农民纷纷的增添耕畜、车辆，仅旅顺铁山区在土地调剂后就增加了耕畜七十二头，中心区在土地调剂后增加了车辆十五台。目前在执行互助政策中的基本问题是：政策尚未完全交代清楚，虽然强调了自愿，但有的仍提出“不准有一户或一亩地不互助”的不正确口号，或采取强迫命令办法。另方面有的只强调自愿，产生了放任自流，使互助组没有领导而致垮台。在等价交换上还有工价不适当的现象。
    （二）关于发展特殊作物和园艺作物的问题。会上认为过去主要的缺点是：税收政策与收购政策对此缺乏积极的鼓励，销路问题也一直没有解决。在扶助经营方面缺乏技术指导，今年旅顺贷花生种是剥了皮的，但没有试验便发给农民，结果出芽率仅有百分之五十。此外对果园缺乏经营管理，一般的认为公营的勿须检查，对私营的又放弃领导，致有些果园听其荒芜了。在发展菜园中缺乏计划，没有根据城市的需要制定种类数量的计划，因此造成了供求不平衡，菜价忽涨忽降，使农民受到了不应有的损失。
    （三）关于农贷问题。会议认为几年来在扶助农业生产上是获得了很大成绩的。目前的主要问题是：农村贷款工作中，没有掌握大量扶助发展特殊作物和园艺作物的重点。同时发放中也有盲目性和平均主义现象。一九四九年春耕中，农民困难不大，但银行仍发放大批贷款，对剩余贷款又不收回，结果形成了摊派的现象。去年台风和物价下降又产生了回收的困难。并且由于平均摊派，使真正需要贷款的农民没有得到必要的帮助，而有些由城市分散到农村去的工人和小商人，却过多的取得了贷款。由于上述情况，及今年预购农产品的贷款问题没有很好掌握，以及某些实物贷款高于市价，致使农民负债过重。其次贷款不够及时。由于干部缺乏深入检查，还发生了少数干部贪污的现象。
    农村供销合作社的问题在于未能很好的结合农民的生产，及时的供给农民以生活资料和生产资料，未能有组织有计划的收购农产品，通过合作社的纽带和桥梁作用，沟通城乡经济。在合作社工作中还存在着单纯的利润观点和怕麻烦的思想。
    关于渔、盐业生产问题，主要是缺乏统一领导。渔区中纠正了过去劳资两利政策执行中过左现象后，现又产生船主滞发工资及不准船工参加工会等现象。其次鱼的销路尚未解决。对渔业贷款不及时或回收过早，致渔民不敢借贷。
    此外，在农产品收购问题上，主要缺点是收购价格不适当，因而予投机商人以活动空隙。
    在农村人民民主专政问题上，对地主旧富农的管制，还存在单纯的管制或放任不管的偏向。对中农和知识分子缺乏进一步的团结。
    在农村干部思想作风问题上，干部缺乏民主作风，和不善于运用群众力量，因而工作方式简单，有强迫命令的现象。这是许多方针政策未能很好贯彻下去的重要原因之一。
    最后，区党委书记欧阳钦同志发言，他对如何贯彻农村几个基本政策提出了很多意见，并特别指出，目前旅大农村干部作风主要的缺点是不注意调查研究，不深入接近群众，不从实际出发，以及强迫命令等。今后在领导方面应特别加强干部的思想政策教育，强调深入工作，联系群众，实事求是的作风。
    会后，全区农村整风将分别转入各农村市县，根据本地区情况进一步的检查研讨。
