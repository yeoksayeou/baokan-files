　　"Our Work is Friendship"
    Director Varlamov's Speech at the Completion Ceremony of "The Victory of the Chinese People"
    Dear comrades! Let us first extend our warm, fraternal greetings to you, the literary and art workers.

    We, the Soviet film workers, began filming this film with great pleasure and hope a year ago, and it will be screened today.

    Thanks to the leadership and assistance of the Central Committee and the Military Commission of the Chinese Communist Party, all conditions were created for our work.

    Our comrades, no matter which field army they were in, were warmly received everywhere and received friendly assistance in completing their tasks.

    Although it is a thing of the past, it is still necessary to mention that at the beginning many of our comrades were not accustomed to the marching speed of the People's Liberation Army and found it a bit difficult.

    However, the consciousness of the commanders and fighters and political workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, their loyalty to their people, and their heroic spirit of self-sacrifice were so great that they encouraged us in the arduous march.

    It once happened that when the soldiers learned that Soviet comrades had come to them to film "The Victory of the Chinese People," they immediately wrote to us saying that they would welcome the Soviet comrades from afar with actions, that is, to strive for the initiative in the first combat mission assigned to the company and battalion.

    One of the conditions for deciding to make this film was to cooperate with Chinese comrades, whether in literature, music, or film.

    On behalf of all our comrades, I would like to thank our colleagues Liu Baiyu, Wu Benli, He Shide, Zhou Feng, and many other comrades who participated in the filming of this film.

    Our work is one of friendship, and this friendship is born in mutual debate and criticism.

    We believe that our film is the first practical cooperation between literary and art workers of the People's Republic of China and Soviet literary and art workers.

    Only after the liberation of China have there been such conditions under which the Chinese people can understand the lives, habits, and art of the Soviet people.

    Now in Moscow, Soviet audiences are watching with great interest the first batch of artistic films of young Chinese cinema that serve the people.

    Great and glorious tasks lie before our literary and art workers, and that task is to consolidate the lasting friendship between our two great nations.

    Now everything is very clear, our friendship is a strong fortress of world peace.

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people's struggle for so many years has been so great and heroic that it is impossible to express its entire history in one film.

    As everyone knows, in the near future, the second film, directed by Comrade Gerasimov, will be screened. According to the plan, that film will mostly focus on the historical introduction of the Chinese Communist Party and the initial achievements of the construction of New Democratic China.

    Our task is to show the main stages of the life and struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, to show the infinite heroism of its commanders and fighters, and to show the people's love and help for their army, whether on the front lines or in the rear.

    What you will see in the film are historical records. These records clearly tell the audience that the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is of historical significance in the establishment of the heroic People's Liberation Army, and is the key to this great victory.

    Long live the heroic People's Liberation Army that won freedom and independence for the Chinese people!

    Long live the Chinese Communist Party that leads the Chinese people's struggle!

    Long live Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people!

　　“我们的工作是友谊的”
    编导瓦尔拉莫夫在“中国人民的胜利”摄制完成大会上的讲演
    亲爱的各位同志们！让我们首先向你们，向文艺工作者致热烈的、兄弟的敬礼。
    我们，苏联电影工作者，在一年前以极大的愉快与希望开始摄制这部影片，它今天将要献映了。
    由于中国共产党中央与军委的领导与帮助，给我们的工作创造了一切条件。
    我们的同志，无论在那个野战军里，他们到处都受到亲切的招待，并在完成他们所负的任务中得到了友谊的帮助。
    虽然已是过去的事了，但是还需要提一下，就是开始我们许多同志对人民解放军部队中的那种进军速度不习惯，觉得有些困难。
    可是中国人民解放军的指战员和政治工作人员的自觉性，他们对自己人民的忠实，他们的英雄主义的、自我牺牲的精神是那样的伟大，以至于在艰苦的进军中鼓舞了我们。
    曾经发生过这样的事情：就是当战士们知道了苏联同志来到他们这里摄制关于“中国人民的胜利”影片之后，马上写信给我们说：他们将以行动来欢迎远道而来的苏联同志们，那就是在连里营里交给的第一次战斗任务里首先争取主动。
    摄制这部影片决定的条件之一，是与中国同志共同合作，无论在文学音乐方面，无论在电影方面都是如此。
    我应当代表我们全体同志向我们的同人刘白羽、吴本立、何士德、周峰、以及其他许多参加摄制本片的同志们致谢。
    我们的工作是友谊的，而这种友谊是在互相争论与批评中产生的。
    我们认为我们的这部片子，是中华人民共和国文艺工作者与苏联的文艺工作者第一次的实际合作。
    只有在中国解放后才有了这样的条件，在这些条件之下，中国的人民群众才有可能了解苏联人民的生活、习惯与艺术。
    现在在莫斯科，苏联的观众以极大的兴趣在看为人民服务的、年青的中国电影第一批艺术片。
    在我们文艺工作者面前摆着伟大而光荣的任务，这个任务就是巩固我们二大民族间的永久友谊。
    现在一切已很明显了，我们的友谊就是全世界和平的强大堡垒。
    在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民多少年来的斗争是那样的伟大与英勇，他的全部历史要在一部片子里表现出来，那是没有可能的。
    大家都知道，在不久的将来，在格拉西莫夫同志领导下所摄制的第二部片子，就要献映了。按计划来说，那部片子多半是偏重于中国共产党历史介绍和新民主主义中国建设的初步成绩。
    我们的任务是表现中国人民解放军生活与斗争的主要阶段。表现其指战员无限的英雄主义，表现无论是前线或者是后方，人民对自己军队的爱与帮助。
    在影片中你所要看到的是历史的纪录。这些纪录，明确的告诉观众，在英勇的人民解放军建军当中，中国共产党的领导是有历史意义的，是决定这一伟大胜利的关键。
    为中国人民争得了自由与独立的英勇人民解放军万岁！
    领导中国人民斗争的中国共产党万岁！
    中国人民的领袖毛泽东万岁！
