　　New Knowledge Forum
    Change to Liao Luyan Speaking on Land Reform Issues
    The message that the Beijing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) had invited Wang Xinyuan, Deputy Minister of the Central Ministry of Light Industry, to the New Knowledge Forum at 7:30 PM on the 10th to give a speech was published in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that in order to meet current needs, the association has specially changed the speaker to Comrade Liao Luyan, who will speak on "Issues Concerning Land Reform and Class Division" (location and time remain the same). The invitation to Deputy Minister Wang to convey the spirit and content of relevant professional conferences on light industry has been rescheduled.
