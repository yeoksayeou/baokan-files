    Liu Qingxiang, Creator of the "Surface Plate Lapping Machine"
    Jinan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions
    Liu Qingxiang, a fitter in the fitter section (formerly the model section) of the Second Factory of the Jinan Industrial Bureau, possesses the unparalleled wisdom and creativity of the working class. He started as an apprentice in an iron factory at the age of fourteen and is now thirty-two years old. In the old society, his wisdom and creativity were suppressed and stifled. Only today, when the working class has become the master, and under the care, education, and help of the Communist Party, has Liu Qingxiang's creative ability begun to shine brightly.
    In less than two years since liberation, Liu Qingxiang has received five awards for his excellent work performance. His greatest contribution is the creation of the surface plate lapping machine, which China had never been able to manufacture before.
    Surface plates, also called standard steel blocks, are composed of steel blocks of different sizes. A box is considered a set, some with eighty-two pieces and some with ninety-two pieces. They can be assembled into a wide variety of measuring scales, with an error of no more than two to eight millionths of an inch. They are the most precise, accurate, and innovative type of measuring instrument, highly needed by laboratories, research institutes, and factory workshops. In the First Factory of the Jinan Industrial Bureau, surface plates are used to inspect and repair models of precision instruments. Without surface plates, it is impossible to manufacture models, and without models, it is difficult to manufacture parts that meet standards. However, surface plates that have been used for a long time will lose accuracy. At that time, the Second Factory of the Jinan Industrial Bureau was the only place in Jinan that had a set of surface plates, which had been in use since the Japanese occupation. After the liberation of Jinan, in order to prolong its lifespan, the leadership stipulated that it could only be used to inspect models and not to manufacture models, which brought great difficulties to the workers making models. At that time, the Second Factory was undertaking the task of manufacturing shells and repairing cannons for the southward-bound army. In order to ensure the smooth completion of this important task and to overcome the difficulties in manufacturing models in the future, Liu Qingxiang expressed to the leadership his intention to try to manufacture a surface plate lapping machine, which received the active support and encouragement of the superiors.
    Liu Qingxiang was determined to manufacture a surface plate lapping machine, but what kind of machine to use? What kind of manufacturing process to follow? He had neither seen it nor heard of it. While pondering in his mind, he consulted with group leader Lu Zhenghua, department director Li Jiuhong, and others.
    After indescribable painstaking research, the drawings were completed. To save materials, he rummaged through scrap iron piles. He found a broken gear disc from a car engine, removed the teeth, and made two circular plates, with holes drilled in the center of each plate, and pulleys installed in between. Only then did he see the hope of success. However, some fellow workers even became jealous and sarcastic. Liu Qingxiang had no personal considerations; he only felt that the factory needed it and the country needed it, so he did not argue with others but instead sought the help of everyone. He said, "I can't do anything alone; even if I succeed, it will be everyone's achievement." He took the parts or charts and humbly went to ask this person "Is this okay?" and went to ask that person "Is this right?" In this way, the relationship between him and his fellow workers had no barriers.
    After many improvements and two months, Liu Qingxiang finally manufactured a surface plate lapping machine using 80% scrap materials, and it was successfully test-run on September 2nd of last year. In February of this year, he produced four boxes of surface plates, which were as exquisite as imported ones. In the manufacturing process, Liu Qingxiang also created six accessories, such as small polishing tools and separation tables.
    The Jinan Industrial Bureau notified all factories of the exemplary deeds of Liu Qingxiang and others, and commended him and Comrade Lu Zhenghua. A celebration and award conference was held, and everyone happily listened to Liu Qingxiang's report on the creative process.
    First, they solved the material problem. Making surface plates requires steel with very little expansion and contraction, which is difficult to find. After research by him and Lu Zhenghua, they decided to use wind steel as a substitute. With the material, how to grind it flat? This was the most difficult problem. Liu Qingxiang initially used a grinding wheel on an open grinder. He ground it this way and that way, but the thin steel sheet was either convex on this side or concave on that side. After half a month, although he had improved the center points and other parts on the machine, he still did not succeed.
    At this time, some workers said: "Forget it, it's useless to put in effort! Engineers at the Kunming 51st Arsenal under the Kuomintang studied it for a long time without success, how can we make it?" Others said: "This is done by bread-eating foreign devils, how can China make it?" However, department director Li Jiuhong always encouraged him. While working, he thought: This thing cannot only rely on the open grinder; we have to think of other ways. In the morning, in the evening, during breaks, his mind was always thinking about the manufacturing of "surface plates," even while walking. Once, he rubbed his hands together to generate heat, and he thought: If two pieces of iron clamp something in between, and one turns this way and the other turns that way, the grinding force would be the same, and the heat generated would be the same, then the steel sheet ground out would not be bent, right? He was very happy and went to draw a diagram, but because he had only studied old books for three or four years, he had no scientific theoretical knowledge; and there were no drawings or objects to compare with, so he could only draw and look, look and tear, tear and think, think and draw again; sometimes he would run to the machine to study it. Gradually, Liu Qingxiang couldn't eat and couldn't sleep, and after day and night of hard work, Liu Qingxiang became thinner and more yellow day by day, and finally fell ill. But in his heart, he was still thinking about "surface plates" all the time. As soon as he felt a little better, he ran to the factory and went to work while ill. His mother discouraged him, and his wife also discouraged him, but Liu Qingxiang comforted them: "Don't worry, I'm not sick, I'll get better after the research is successful."
    Liu Qingxiang's successful creation, under the slogan of "Self-reliance, smashing the imperialist blockade" at the time, not only solved the difficulties of the factory and encouraged everyone's creativity; it also played a certain role in the national industry. He broke the erroneous notion of some people relying on foreign countries in everything. This spring, the surface plate lapping machine created by Liu Qingxiang was sent to the Beijing Industrial Exhibition, winning praise and acclaim from the scientific community, the industrial community, and even international friends.
    Liu Qingxiang is a child from a poor family who started as an ironworker at the age of fourteen and suffered enough beatings and scoldings from his boss. After liberation, he came to work in the people's factory. He is unspeakably happy in his new life, working hard every day, creating many achievements, and repeatedly receiving awards from his superiors. Liu Qingxiang often says with a smile, "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class can invent, can create, and can overcome all difficulties to build a new China for the people in their own factories."

　　创造“对板精磨机”的刘庆祥
    济南市总工会
    刘庆祥，是济南工业局二厂钳工部（以前是样板部）的钳工，具有着工人阶级的无比的智慧和创造力。他十四岁开始到一家铁工厂当学徒，今年三十二岁。在旧社会，他的智慧和创造力受尽压抑和扼杀；只有在工人阶级做了主人的今天，在共产党的爱护、教育和帮助之下，刘庆祥的创造能力才开始发出灿烂的光辉。
    刘庆祥在解放后不到两年的功夫，由于他工作的优良成绩，连受五次奖励。他的最大的贡献是创制了中国从来不能制造的对板精磨机。
    对板又叫标准钢块，是由一些不同大小的钢块组成的。一盒算一套，有的八十二块，有的九十二块。可以凑成极多种的测量尺度，差误数不能超过一英寸的百万分之二——八，是最精密、最准确，也是最新颖的一种测量器，对试验室、研究室、工厂车间都很需要。在济南工业局一厂，是用对板检验、修制精密器械的样板。没有对板就没法制造样板，没有样板就很难制造出合乎标准的零件。但用久了的对板就会减低准确性。当时，济南市只有工业局二厂有一套对板，从日本统治时期就开始在用了。济南解放后，为了延长它的寿命，领导上就提出只能用它检验样板，不准用它制造样板，这就带给了制样板的工人们极大的困难。而当时二厂正担负着为南下大军制造炮弹和修理大炮的任务。刘庆祥为使这一重要任务能顺利完成，为克服今后制造样板的困难，他向领导上表示出自己想试制对板精磨机的意图，并得到了上级的积极支持和鼓励。
    刘庆祥下决心要制造对板精磨机，但是用什么样的机器作？经过什么样的制造过程？他既没有见过，也没有听说过。他一面在心里思索着，一面就找组长陆正华、部主任李久洪等人商量。
    经过难以形容的苦心钻研，图样画好了。为了节省材料，他就在废铁堆里翻来翻去，他找到汽车引擎上的一个破牙盘，把齿子弄去，制成了两个圆盘，两盘中心打上了孔，两个中间装上皮带轮。这时，才看到了成功的希望。但是，有的工友竟然妒嫉、讽刺起来了。刘庆祥没有什么为自己打算的地方，只是感到厂内需要，国家需要，所以他不去和人争长论短，而是去争取大伙的帮助。他说：“我一人是什么也干不成的，就是成功了也是大家的成绩。”他拿着零件或图表，虚心的走到这个跟前问问“行不行”？走到那个跟前问问“对不对”？这样，他和工友间的感情也就没有什么隔阂了。
    经过多次的改进，两个多月的时间，刘庆祥用百分之八十的废料，终于制造成了一部对板精磨机，在去年九月二日试车成功。今年二月，制出了四盒对板，这些对板和舶来品一样精美。在制造过程中，刘庆祥还创造出小的磨光器、分离表等六种附件。
    济南市工业局把刘庆祥等人的模范事迹通报各厂，嘉奖了他和陆正华同志。开了庆奖大会，个个欢天喜地地听刘庆祥报告创造经过。
    首先他们解决了材料问题。做对板要用伸缩性很小的钢，这种材料很难找。他和陆正华研究结果是用风钢来代替。有了材料，怎样将它磨平呢？这是最困难的问题。刘庆祥开始是在开口磨机上用砂轮磨，这样磨，那样磨，但那薄薄的钢片，不是这边凸就是那边凹，经过半月的时间，虽也改进了机器上的顶尖等零件，但总没有成功。
    这时，有的工人说：“算了，用劲也是白搭一支腊！国民党时昆明五十一兵工厂工程师研究好久都不成，咱还弄成了？”也有的说：“这是吃面包的洋鬼子干的，中国怎能制出来？”可是，部主任李久洪同志总是鼓励他。他一面干着，一面想：这玩意不能光在开口磨机上打主意，得另想办法。早晨，晚上，在休息的时候，他脑子里无时不在想“对板”的制造问题，甚至走着路也想。有一次，他把两手对起来磨擦生热，他想：假如两块铁夹着一块东西，一向这转，一向那转，磨力一样大，发热也一样，那样磨出的钢片不就不弯了吗？他非常高兴的去画图，但因为他仅仅读过三、四年旧书，自己没有什么科学理论知识；又无图样或实物可以比着画，他只有画了看，看了撕，撕了想，想了再画；有时又跑到机器上去钻研。渐渐的刘庆祥饭也吃不下去了，觉也睡不好，经过日日夜夜的克苦努力钻研，刘庆祥眼看着一天天的黄了瘦了，最后终于病倒了。但他心里却还时时刻刻的想着“对板”。病稍好点，他就往厂里跑，带病上工。母亲劝阻，老婆也劝，刘庆祥反去安慰她们：“放心吧，我没有病，研究成功后就会好了。”
    刘庆祥的创制成功，当时在“自力更生，粉碎帝国主义的封锁”的口号下，不仅解决了厂里的困难，鼓舞了大伙的创造性；就在全国工业上，也有一定的作用。他打破了某些人处处依靠外国的错误观念。今年春天，刘庆祥创制的对板精磨机送到北京工业展览会上，博得科学界、工业界，甚至国际友人的赞扬与好评。
    刘庆祥是一个贫家的孩子，十四岁就学铁工，受够了老板的打骂。解放后，他才到人民的工厂工作。他在新的生活中，说不出的愉快，每天积极努力，创造了许多成绩，屡次受到上级的奖励。刘庆祥常常微笑的对人说：“中国的工人阶级在中国共产党的领导下，在人民自己的工厂里，能发明，能创造，能战胜一切的困难，来建设人民的新中国。”
