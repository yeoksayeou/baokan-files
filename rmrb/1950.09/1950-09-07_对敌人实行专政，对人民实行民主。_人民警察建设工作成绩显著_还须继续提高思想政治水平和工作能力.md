	Exercise Dictatorship over the Enemy, Practice Democracy among the People.
    The Work of Building the People's Police Has Achieved Remarkable Results; It Is Still Necessary to Continue to Improve Ideological and Political Level and Work Ability
    [This Newspaper News] In the first National Public Security Administrative Work Conference convened by the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government, the guiding principles and plans for further building the People's Police were determined. This was proposed on the basis of the achievements already made in the construction work of the People's Police in various parts of the country over the past year. Over the past year, under the leadership of the public security organs of the people's governments at all levels, the people's police in various parts of the country have achieved many successes in the continuous struggle against the remnants of the counter-revolution, severely suppressed the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, and established a revolutionary order in order to defend the victorious achievements and legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people. Many people's police in various places have demonstrated a fine style of hard struggle. For example, police officers Liu Hongnian and Xu Yunsheng of the Fourth Police Station of the Sixth Branch of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, police officer Wu Yunfu of the Lifu'an Police Station of the Third Branch of the Nanjing Public Security Bureau, and police officer Huang Weisheng of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, fought bravely and sacrificed heroically in fighting bandits. These are the most striking examples. Many policemen said, "We are people's police today, and we must be responsible to the people." In the past six months, public security bureaus and police stations in major cities across the country have generally established a working system for holding regular residents' meetings, often reporting their work, reviewing their shortcomings, and soliciting opinions from the masses at the meetings. On the one hand, it has enhanced the enthusiasm and vigilance of the masses and effectively strengthened the connection between the public security organs and the masses; on the other hand, it has also enabled the police officers to receive profound education under the supervision of the masses. When the police stations in Andong City, Northeast China, held residents' meetings last winter, they mobilized the masses to boldly put forward criticisms and suggestions, totaling 261 items, of which 121 were criticisms of the old working style of the police personnel. There were also 70 suggestions for improving the work of the police station. This not only educated the police personnel, but also enabled the masses to recognize the fundamental difference between the people's police and the reactionary police. They said, "We used to think that the people's police station was just like the past, only managing the people, but it turned out that they did so many good things for us!" "This is really the people being the masters! The police station reviewed its work with us, black is black, white is white, and mistakes are corrected. They serve us wholeheartedly!" This won the support of the masses. In Shenyang, due to the development of this work, in less than a month, more than 3,000 residents' reflections were received, which powerfully assisted the public security organs in solving various cases.
    The reason why the people's police in various places have achieved these achievements is mainly because the public security organs across the country have correctly implemented the public security policies, especially the policy of educating and reforming the old police personnel, so that all public security personnel have received ideological education and policy education on serving the people through rectification, salary evaluation, appraisal, people's representative meetings, and rectification campaigns, and have obtained the supervision and assistance of the broad masses of the people. However, because the majority of police personnel in various places are old police officers retained, or new police officers who have just joined the work, some of the retained old police officers are still seriously affected by the bad style of the Kuomintang rule period, and have not been completely transformed until now. They generally showed a strong mercenary point of view, and a few people were still doing evil, even colluding with bandits and disturbing public order. Among some new police officers, although their composition is relatively pure, they are not politically strong enough, their professional skills are not proficient, and some have even been infected with bad habits. In order to eliminate bandits and special agents, and consolidate the great achievements of public security work, the public security organs across the country must continue to improve the ideological and political level and work ability of the people's police, and continue to improve their work, so as to effectively implement the glorious task of "exercising dictatorship over the enemy and practicing democracy among the people."

　　对敌人实行专政，对人民实行民主。
    人民警察建设工作成绩显著
    还须继续提高思想政治水平和工作能力
    【本报讯】在中央人民政府公安部所召开的第一次全国治安行政工作会议中，确定了进一步建设人民警察的方针和计划。这是根据一年来全国各地人民警察的建设工作已得的成绩为基础而提出的。一年来全国各地人民警察，在各级人民政府公安机关的领导下，为保卫中国人民胜利的成果和合法权益，在与反革命残余进行不断的斗争中，获得了不少成绩，对反革命分子的活动进行了严厉的镇压；建立了革命秩序。各地不少人民警察表现了艰苦奋斗的优良作风。如北京市公安六分局第四派出所警士刘鸿年、徐云生，南京市公安局三分局李府庵派出所警士伍云甫，上海市公安局员警黄伟生等，在与匪徒格斗中，奋不顾身，英勇牺牲。这些就是最显著的例子。许多警察都说：“我们今天是人民警察了，要对人民负责。”近半年来，全国各大城市公安分局、派出所，均普遍建立定期召开居民会议的工作制度，经常在会上向群众报告工作，检讨缺点，征询群众意见。一方面提高了群众的积极性和警惕性，有效地加强了公安机关与群众的联系；另一方面也使干警在群众的监督下，受到了深刻的教育。东北安东市各派出所去冬召开居民会议时，发动群众大胆提出批评与建议的意见，先后有二百六十一条，其中关于批评警察人员旧作风的达一百二十一条之多。另有改进派出所工作的建议七十条。这不仅教育了警察人员，群众亦由此认清了人民警察与反动警察的根本区别。他们说：“早先我们认为人民警察派出所也跟过去一样是光管人民的，原来还给咱们做了那么多好事情呀！”“这真是老百姓做主人！派出所向咱们检讨工作，黑是黑，白是白，有了错就改，人家是全心全意为咱们服务！”从而取得了群众的拥护。沈阳市亦由于这一工作的开展，不到一月，即收到三千多居民反映的材料，有力地协助了公安机关破获各种案件。
    各地人民警察之所以获得这些成绩，主要是由于全国各公安机关正确执行了公安政策，特别是教育改造旧警察人员的政策，使所有公安人员通过整训、评薪、鉴定、人民代表会议、整风等方式，接受了为人民服务的思想教育和政策教育，并取得了广大人民的监督与帮助的结果。但是因为各地警察人员中绝大部分是留用的旧警察，或新参加工作的员警，在留用的旧警察中，有的还受着国民党统治时期恶劣作风的严重影响，至今还没有彻底地改造过来。他们普遍表现了浓厚的雇佣观点，有少数人仍在为非作歹，甚至勾结盗匪，扰乱治安。在一部分新的警察中，他们虽然成份较纯洁，但政治上不够坚强，业务技术不熟练，甚至有的还沾染上坏习气。为了肃清土匪特务，巩固公安工作的巨大成绩，今后全国公安机关还须继续提高人民警察的思想政治水平和工作能力，继续改进工作，以便有效的执行“对敌人实行专政，对人民实行民主”的光荣任务。
