Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 28th: Compared to the powerful Northeast steel industry, the relatively weaker Northeast machinery industry is gradually growing stronger. Over the past year or more, the machine equipment and number of workers in the eleven units under the Northeast People's Government Machinery Administration have significantly increased. Comparing June of this year with the takeover period at the end of 1948, the number of various operational machine tools has increased several times. The number of employees increased from 2,800 in January of last year to more than 20,000 in June of this year. In the past year, the factories under the Machinery Administration have produced thousands of various machine tools, rock drills, transportation machines, air compressors, water pumps, melting furnaces, etc. The total output value for the first half of this year exceeded the total output value for the entire last year by 38.8 percent. During the puppet Manchukuo era, rock drills were entirely imported from Japan. After a successful trial production in November of last year, mass production began immediately. Ball bearing retainers and grinding wheel raw material, corundum, etc., can now be manufactured domestically.

While the entire machinery industry is gradually growing stronger, the various units of the Northeast Machinery Administration have also made various efforts to improve product quality, such as re-establishing reasonable and strict quality standards, strengthening the product inspection system, and paying attention to the technical training of new workers. As of the end of June, 5,000 new workers have received technical training to improve their skills. One of the main gains from the mechanical industrial units learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union is the implementation of the continuous operation method on the basis of preliminary quota management, which makes production more orderly, with clear stages of procedures, clear responsibilities, and easy inspection. Due to the above-mentioned various efforts, the quality of mechanical industrial products has improved significantly. The lathes produced by the First Machine Tool Factory in the first quarter had a 100% failure rate due to strict new technical standards, but in the second quarter, the pass rate rose to 94%.

Currently, the various units under the Bureau still face many difficulties in their progress. For example, due to the lack of design and drafting personnel, many products cannot be manufactured temporarily. Due to the large increase in new workers, the technical level has relatively decreased, and due to the lack of raw materials or poor quality of raw materials, the improvement of production efficiency and quality has been affected. Efforts are currently being made to resolve these issues.

　　东北机械工业日渐壮大
    凿岩机金钢砂等均能自制
    【新华社沈阳二十八日电】和强大的东北钢铁工业相比而显得薄弱的东北机械工业，已渐趋壮大。一年多来，东北人民政府机械管理局所属十一个单位的机器设备和工人的数量，都有显著增加。以今年六月份与一九四八年底接管时期比较，各种可以运转的工作母机已增加数倍；职工由去年一月的二千八百人增至今年六月份二万多人。一年来机械局各厂生产各种工作母机、凿岩机、运输机、空气压缩机、水泵、熔铁炉等，共达数千台；今年上半年的生产总值超过去年全年百分之三十八点八。凿岩机在伪满时代，全由日本输入。去年十一月试制成功后，即开始大量生产。滚珠保持器以及砂轮原料——金钢砂等，现已能自己制造。
    在整个机械工业渐趋壮大的同时，东北机械管理局各单位，对改进产品质量，也作了种种努力。如重新制定合理严格的质量标准；加强产品检查制度；注意新工人的技术训练等。截至六月底为止，已有五千新工人受到了提高技术的训练。机械工业单位学习苏联先进经验的主要收获之一是在初步定额管理的基础上实行了连续作业法，使生产进行得更有秩序，工序阶段分明，职责明确，便于检查。由于上述各种不同的努力，机械工业产品质量提高相当显著。第一机械厂第一季生产的车床，因新技术标准严格，百分之百不合格，到了第二季合格率即上升到百分之九十四。
    现该局各单位仍存在着许多前进中的困难。如由于设计和制图人员的缺乏，不少产品暂时还不能制造；由于新工人的大量增加，技术水平相对减低，以及由于原材料缺乏或原材料质量不好，生产效率和质量的提高受到影响等。现正设法解决中。
