　　Huang Yisan of Mianyang County, Hubei
    Unjustly Detains Informant
    County Government Dismisses Him

    Li Nong, a wine merchant from Fengkou Town, Sixth District, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, made some progress in his thinking after being educated by the Communist Party and the People's Government after liberation. In January of this year, he was invited to participate in the first Mianyang County People's Representative Conference. At the meeting, he reported the facts of the warehouse cadre Dong Qishun's embezzlement and malfeasance and the fact that Wu Zhijia, the chairman of the town's Chamber of Commerce, increased the burden on merchants and civilians. After the meeting, the Mianyang County People's Government sent people to investigate and deal with the matter. Dong Qishun was removed from his post and investigated, and Wu Zhi was criticized. Later, Li Nong moved to Fuchang Street in the district because of his improper behavior, which was opposed by the masses. Li then discovered that Li (name unknown), the chairman of the street's Chamber of Commerce, and Luo Muxiang, the vice-chairman, had embezzled tax money, so he secretly reported to the county government, mentioning that Jiang Jinyuan, the deputy district chief of the district, had condoned the situation.

    In mid-February, Huang Yisan, deputy section chief of the Civil Affairs Section of the Mianyang County People's Government, went to Fuchang to inspect the dike repair work and investigate the case of the chairman and vice-chairman of the street's Chamber of Commerce engaging in embezzlement. After Huang arrived at the place, he stayed at the home of Chairman Li, believing that this would facilitate the investigation of Li's embezzlement. However, as a result, Huang was deceived and instigated by them, believing that Li Nong was suspected of false accusation. The Chamber of Commerce detained Li overnight, interrogated him, and charged Li with unfounded crimes such as "falsely accusing cadres" and "disrupting the market." Afterwards, he was sent to the district (and was later released by Jiang Jinyuan, the deputy district chief of the district).

    In late February, 28 people from Fengkou Town anonymously accused Jiang Jinyuan, the deputy district chief of the district, to the Mianyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office. The Mianyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office forwarded the case to the Mianyang County People's Government for investigation and handling. After Huang Yisan, the deputy section chief, received this case, because of his previous prejudice against Li Nong, he subjectively estimated that Li Nong was the one who caused the trouble, and issued a summons to the district, ordering Li Nong to be brought to justice. On March 29, when the district sent Li to the county bound up, Huang had gone to the province for a meeting. Others did not understand the situation and had to send Li to the Public Security Bureau for detention overnight. The next day, the county magistrate ordered Li Nong to be released.

    After the Mianyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this matter, the Discipline Inspection Committee immediately sent someone to investigate. According to the results of the investigation, the Prefectural Committee believed that although Li Nong himself did not have high prestige among the masses and was not qualified to be a representative of merchants and civilians, no conscious sabotage behavior against the People's Government was found. Regardless of Li Nong's motivation for reporting the dereliction of duty of cadres, the several things he reflected were completely factual. Although someone anonymously accused Deputy District Chief Jiang Jinyuan, there was no basis to prove that Li Nong did it, but only Comrade Huang Yisan's subjective estimation.

    Comrade Huang Yisan is not only a member of the Communist Party of China, but also serves as the deputy section chief of the Mianyang County People's Government. He should adopt a sincere and welcoming attitude towards various constructive criticisms from the people. However, he not only failed to pay full attention to the criticism from the masses, but also violated the Common Program and adopted an attitude of attacking critics, arbitrarily imposing the crime of "false accusation" on people and detaining them twice. In addition, under the cover of Li, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, a bad element, he actually listened to false accusations, causing damage to the political prestige of the Party and the People's Government. Therefore, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Prefectural Committee decided to give Comrade Huang Yisan a criticism within the Party and suggested that the government dismiss him (the Mianyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office has now dismissed him).

### 湖北沔阳县黄益三  无理扣押密告人  县政府已予以撤职处分

　　湖北沔阳县黄益三
    无理扣押密告人
    县政府已予以撤职处分编者同志：
    湖北沔阳县六区峰口镇酒商李农，解放后在共产党和人民政府的教育下，思想上有了一定的进步。今年一月，他被邀参加沔阳县第一届各界人民代表会。他在会议上检举了该镇仓库干部董其顺贪污舞弊和该镇商会会长吴智加重商民负担的事实。会后，沔阳县人民政府即派人进行调查处理，董其顺被撤职查办、吴智则受到批评。后来，李农因行为不检，遭到群众反对，遂迁居到该区府场街。李又发现该街商会正会长李某（名不详）、副会长罗木香有贪污税款行为，即向县政府密告，其中并提到该区副区长姜进元有纵容情事。
    二月中旬，沔阳县人民政府民政科副科长黄益三到府场检查修堤工作，并调查该街商会正副会长营私舞弊案。黄至该地后宿在李会长家中，自以为如此便于调查李的贪污事迹。但结果黄受了他们的蒙蔽和挑拨，认为李农有诬告嫌疑，在商会将李押了一夜，并加以审讯，加李以“诬告干部”、“捣乱市场”等莫须有的罪名。随后又将其送区（后经该区副区长姜进元释放）。
    二月下旬峰口镇有二十八人向沔阳专署匿名控告该区姜进元副区长，沔阳专署即将该案转沔阳县人民政府调查处理。黄益三副科长接到此一案件后，因以往对李农存有成见，便主观地估计是他捣的鬼，发传票至区，命传李农到案。三月二十九日，区把李捆送到县时，黄已去省开会。别人不了解情况，只得将李送交公安局看押一夜，次日县长令将李农释放。
    中共沔阳地委发现此事后，当即由纪律检查委员会派专人前往调查。根据调查结果，地委以为李农本人虽在群众中威信不高，不足以为商民代表，但并未发现李农对人民政府有任何有意识的破坏行为。不管李农检举失职干部的报告的动机如何，他所反映的几件事情则完全是事实。虽然有人匿名诬告副区长姜进元，但没有任何根据足以证明系李农所为，而仅是黄益三同志的主观估计。
    黄益三同志既是中共党员，又身任沔阳县人民政府副科长，应对来自人民群众中的各种建设性的批评，采取竭诚欢迎的态度。但他对群众的批评不仅未予以充分重视，反而违反共同纲领，采取对批评者施以打击的态度，随便给人加以“诬告”罪名，予以两次扣押。此外，他在坏分子商会会长李某的蒙蔽下，竟听信诬告，使党和人民政府的政治威信，受到损失。为此，地委纪律检查委员会决定：党内给黄益三以批评处分，并建议政府予以撤职（现沔阳专署已予以撤职处分）。
