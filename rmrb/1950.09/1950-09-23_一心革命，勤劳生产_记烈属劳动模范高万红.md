　　Wholeheartedly Dedicated to Revolution, Diligent in Production
    ——Remembering Martyr's Family Member and Model Worker Gao Wanhong

    On September 26th, at the model worker selection meeting in Chahar Province, farmer model worker representatives unanimously voted to elect Gao Wanhong as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor, Peasant, and Soldier Model Representatives.
    Gao Wanhong is from Dongjiagou, Yanqing, and is thirty-four years old this year. Dongjiagou is in a mountain valley more than eighty li east of Qinglong Bridge. From 1938 onwards, this village became an essential transit point between the Pingxi and Pingbei anti-Japanese base areas. Intelligence and transportation stations were established in the village. With the help of comrades working at the transportation station, Gao Wanhong's consciousness gradually improved. In April 1939, she joined the Communist Party. Under her influence and assistance, her husband also made progress and became a Communist Party member. Later, her husband became the village head, and she became the director of the Women's National Salvation Association. Both of them worked very actively.

  Bravely and Calmly Participating in the Struggle

    One morning in October 1941, a unit of our army was pursued by the enemy from the mountain northeast of the village. Enemies were also spotted on the mountain peaks to the southeast and northwest. The situation was very urgent. At this time, she did not hesitate to put down her child and led the troops out of the enemy's three-sided encirclement. Old Ren, a county cadre, was injured, and she hid him in a mountain gully to recuperate. Once, when mobilizing women to make cotton clothes for the army, the materials had just been distributed to each household when the enemy set out. Each household sent them back. Gao Wanhong calmly bundled up the cotton and cloth, carrying bundle after bundle into the mountain cave. She even held her child there to guard them.

  Enthusiastically Rescuing the Wounded

    In the spring of 1947, her husband gloriously sacrificed his life while supporting the troops in attacking Yongning City. Comrade Wanhong hated the enemy even more. In early September, the Chicheng County Brigade passed through Dongjiagou after a battle. One soldier was wounded in the leg and could not keep up with the troops. Gao Wanhong automatically carried his rifle and grenades on her back, helping him to the mountain gully and entrusting someone to send him to the hospital. On her way back, she met another soldier whose legs had been injured by machine gun fire, making it impossible for him to move. She immediately pulled up kudzu vines to use as ropes, made a harness, and carried the soldier five li to the village ahead. She found a stretcher, padded the wounded soldier with her jacket, and watched him being sent away before braving the cold night wind to return home. In November, when our army attacked strongholds such as Erdaohuzi, Lianhuatan, and Gaoshan Temple, she exchanged her half-sheng of millet for one sheng of rice and mobilized seven women to go to Shatangou to comfort the wounded. It was snowing heavily, and the weather was very cold. The feet of the civilian laborers carrying the stretchers were frozen and could not quickly carry the wounded to their destination. The eight women immediately joined the stretcher team.

  Actively Participating in Labor and Production

    After her husband's sacrifice, Gao Wanhong relied entirely on her own labor to make a living. The family had only four mu of land, two rooms, and some tattered furniture, and owed others one shi and five dou of millet. Raising four children, the house was burned down by Chiang bandits that winter, and life was very hard. The government lent her two bolts of homespun cloth, and she borrowed two more from her sister, bought a donkey, and ran transportation and farmed, crossing mountains and ridges, just to get through the difficulties. In the autumn, she harvested two shi of corn and one shi of grain. In the winter, she earned two hundred and fifty jin of millet and eighty jin of naked oats from transportation. Last spring, she built a large tile-roofed house and bought a lot of furniture. Last year's harvest was not good; the six and a half mu of land (she was allocated another two and a half mu during the land reform) yielded only eight hundred jin of sweet potatoes and one dustpan of grain. But she had prepared a lot of sweet potato leaves and apricot leaves to survive the famine. This year, she applied more than seventy loads of fertilizer to her six and a half mu of land, and the autumn crops were weeded three times. The corn and beans are growing very well. This spring, she planted four hundred and eighty fruit trees, and also one thousand other trees such as poplars and willows. Some people envied and said: "Gao Wanhong is stronger than a man, leading four children, and making a good life!"

  Leading Everyone to Practice Mutual Aid

    Gao Wanhong relied on mutual aid for plowing and sowing her land. She not only managed her own production well but also led everyone. This spring, after returning from a meeting in the county, she organized three women's work exchange teams, and all twenty-one women in the village capable of labor were organized. They worked together with the men, and after planting more than five hundred mu of land in the village, they drew out eighteen male laborers to sell their labor outside to survive the famine. Weeding was mainly completed by the women's work exchange team and the children's organization under the leadership of Gao Wanhong. Combined with weeding, she also launched the digging of wild vegetables to prevent famine. In the summer, she also led the work exchange team to plant more than two thousand four hundred trees and opened eighteen mu of summer fallow.

    She herself is a martyr's family member, but not only does she not want the village to farm for her, but she also always cares about the production of military dependents. Each of the three women's work exchange teams contracted three mu of land for military dependents, and they also checked each other to see who was doing well. They also planted more than seven hundred trees for military dependents and pressed more than ninety bundles of wormwood fertilizer. Some military dependents did not save the preferential grain they received, so she went to persuade them. In addition, she used different methods to reform four lazy women, leading them onto the right path of production.

    Gao Wanhong cares about everyone in the village. She said: "I want everyone to have a good life!" The whole village also loves her. Last spring, when she built her house, everyone automatically helped her with thirty-one workdays. She said: "Without the help of the whole village, I would not have a good life!"

　　一心革命，勤劳生产
    ——记烈属劳动模范高万红
    九月二十六日，在察哈尔省评选劳模会议上，农民劳模代表一致投票选举了高万红为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议代表。
    高万红是延庆董家沟人，今年三十四岁。董家沟在青龙桥东面八十多里地的山沟里。从一九三八年后，该村就成为平西与平北两个抗日根据地交通来往必经的村庄。村里建立了情报站和交通站。高万红在交通站工作同志的帮助下，觉悟慢慢提高了。在一九三九年四月，她就参加了共产党。在她的影响和帮助下，她的丈夫也进步了，并成为共产党员。以后，她丈夫又当了村长，她当了妇女救国会主任。她们俩工作都很积极。
  勇敢沉着参加斗争
    一九四一年十月的一天早晨，我军一部被敌人从村东北面的山上追了过来；东南、西北两面山头上也发现了敌人，情况非常紧急，这时她毫不犹豫的放下小孩，引着部队突出了敌人的三面包围。县干部老任挂了彩，她把他藏在山沟里去休养。有一次，发动妇女给军队做棉衣，材料刚分配到各家，敌人出发了。各家又都送回来。高万红沉着的把棉花、布都捆了起来，一捆一捆的扛到山洞里。自己还抱着孩子在那里看守着。
  热心救护伤员
    一九四七年的春天，她丈夫在支援部队攻打永宁城时，光荣地牺牲了。万红同志对敌人更加仇恨。九月初，赤城县大队作战后走过董家沟，有一战士腿部负了伤，跟不上部队，高万红就自动的给他背上大枪、手榴弹，扶着送到山沟，托人转送到医院去。她在回来的路上，又遇见了一个战士，两腿都被机枪打坏，行动不得。她马上拔了葛条当绳子，挽成套，把这个战士背了五里地，到了前面的村里，找好了担架，又把夹袄给伤员垫上，看着把伤员送走了，她才冒着黑夜的寒风回了家。十一月间，我军攻打二道河子、莲花滩、高山寺等据点，她用自己的升半小米换了一升大米，动员了七个妇女到沙滩沟去慰劳伤员。下着大雪，天气很冷。抬担架的民工脚都冻坏了，不能很快的把伤员抬到目的地。她们八个妇女马上参加了担架队。
  积极劳动生产
    丈夫牺牲后，高万红全靠自己劳动过活。家里只有四亩地，两间房子及一些破烂家具，还欠了别人一石五斗小米。抚养着四个孩子，房子在当年冬天为蒋匪烧了，生活很苦，政府借给她两匹土布，她又从姐姐家借了两匹，买了一头驴，就爬山过岭的跑运输、种地，就这样的度过了困难。秋天，打了两石玉茭、一石谷子。冬季跑运输赚了二百五十斤小米，八十斤莜面。去年春天盖起了一大间瓦房，还买了不少家具。去年收成不好，六亩半地（土改时又分给她二亩半）只收了八百斤白薯、一簸箕谷子。但她却早准备下很多度荒的白薯叶和杏叶。今年她六亩半地上有七十多驮粪，大秋庄稼都锄了三遍，玉米和豆子长得都很好。今年春天，她栽了果木树四百八十棵，其他杨柳等树也有一千棵。有些人羡慕的说：“高万红比男人还强，领着四个孩子，把光景过好了！”
  带动大家拨工互助
    高万红土地的养种都是靠拨工互助，她不但搞好了自己的生产，还带起了大家。今春她从县里开会回去，就组织起了三个妇女拨工组，全村五十三户能劳动的二十一个妇女都组织起来了。她们和男人们共同拨工，把全村五百多亩地种上以后，又抽出了十八个男劳动力出外卖工度荒。锄苗主要是高万红领导着妇女拨工组和儿童组织拨工完成的。结合着锄苗，她还发动了挖野菜，防备灾荒。夏天，她还带动拨工组栽了二千四百多棵树，开了十八亩夏荒。
    她自己是烈属，不但不要村上代耕，还时时关心着军属的生产。三个妇女拨工组，每组给军属包耕了三亩地，并且还互相检查，看谁做的好。她们并给军属栽了七百余棵树，压了九十多捆蒿肥。个别军属领下优待粮不节约，她就去说服他们。此外，她还用了不同的方式，改造了四个懒婆，使她们走上了生产的正路。
    高万红关心着村里的每一个人，她说：“我愿意大家全把光景过好！”全村的人也热爱她。去年春天她盖房时，大家自动的帮了她三十一个工，她说：“没有全村人的帮助，我也过不好光景！”
