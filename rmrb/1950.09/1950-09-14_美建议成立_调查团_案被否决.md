Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 13th: TASS, New York, September 13th - The Security Council's September 12th meeting began to consider the People's Republic of China's accusation against the United States for bombing Chinese territory. In this regard, the Security Council had two draft resolutions before it: Firstly, the Soviet Union's proposal to condemn these illegal actions and demand that the United States prohibit them; and secondly, the U.S. suggestion to establish an investigation team to investigate the bombing incidents.

Although the Chinese People's Government had filed the accusation, the United States, with the help of its satellite states, had on September 11th prevented the Soviet proposal that the Security Council should invite representatives of the Chinese government to attend and hear their statements from passing. Moreover, although the Soviet proposal was submitted on August 31st, and the U.S. proposal was submitted on September 1st, the U.S. delegation still tried to have the Security Council consider the U.S. proposal first. At the beginning of the meeting, Security Council President Jebb acknowledged that if the Security Council considered the U.S. proposal first, it would violate the Security Council's rules of procedure. He suggested that the Security Council hold a general discussion on the issues of the Soviet and U.S. proposals first, and then decide which proposal to vote on first. U.S. Representative Austin then blatantly advocated violating the Security Council's rules and urged the Security Council to vote on the U.S. proposal first.

Jebb, speaking in his capacity as the representative of the United Kingdom, supported the U.S. request that the Security Council vote on the U.S. proposal first, and then the Soviet proposal.

Soviet Representative Malik then responded sternly to Austin, saying that Austin's argument was unfounded. He said that Austin's suggestion to consider the U.S. proposal first would not save the Security Council's time, but would actually hinder the discussion. Malik said that the Security Council should follow the rules of procedure and consider major proposals in the order in which they were submitted. The Soviet proposal was submitted first, so it should be voted on first. The United States has long adopted a policy of violating the Charter and the Security Council's rules of procedure, and is now starting up its mechanical voting machine, attempting to violate the rules of procedure again. The U.S. delegation is also resorting to distorting the facts. In response to Austin's statement on September 11th that the Soviet Union was forcing the bombing of Chinese territory onto the Security Council's agenda, Malik said that the whole world knows that this issue, as well as the invasion of Taiwan, was raised to the Security Council by the Chinese People's Government. Austin's argument does not conform to reality. Malik pointed out that the Soviet representative, in his capacity as President of the Security Council in August, rightfully brought the Chinese government's accusation to the Security Council. Regarding Austin's claim that these items were put on the agenda to damage the reputation of the "United Nations forces" in Korea, Malik pointed out that this statement is also not in accordance with reality. He said that it is the United States armed forces that are carrying out aggression against the Korean people, not the "United Nations forces."

Malik further replied to Austin, saying: The inclusion of these two cases on the Security Council's agenda proves that the United States is not only an aggressor against Korea, but also an aggressor against Chinese Taiwan and the Northeast. After interfering in the Korean War, the U.S. ruling clique continued to invade Taiwan and attack peaceful Chinese residents, thereby expanding the aggression. After obstructing the proposal to invite Chinese representatives to the Security Council, the U.S. is now attempting to force the Security Council to accept its proposal. Malik pointed out that without the participation of the country concerned, the Security Council obviously cannot decide to send an investigation team to any country. The United States is accustomed to sending its special envoys and missions to wherever it wants to go without consulting the countries concerned. But free people cannot allow the fascist heads and spies of the United States in various regions to go wherever they want. He said that the United States is suggesting that the Security Council accept America's shameless method, dispatching an investigation team to China without consulting the Chinese People's Government or obtaining its consent. The United States not only put forward this proposal, but also attempted to force others to accept its proposal with extremely hasty procedural practices. The Security Council must not adopt this illegal policy.

In response to Austin's statement that the Security Council currently lacks sufficient materials regarding the U.S. bombing of China, Malik pointed out that Zhou Enlai's telegrams to the Security Council included materials on this situation. He also said that the Security Council also heard Austin admit that U.S. aircraft violated Chinese airspace. Austin attempted to present "mitigating circumstances," but did not deny the U.S. attacks. Malik then asked, who is preventing the Security Council from obtaining more facts? He said that it is the United States that is obstructing China from participating in the Security Council meeting. Malik pointed out that Austin's attitude is self-contradictory, and said: If the United States had not prevented the Security Council from inviting China, the Security Council would have obtained all the facts long ago. Malik concluded: The Soviet delegation believes that it is reasonable to discuss the Soviet and U.S. proposals, but these proposals should be voted on in accordance with the Security Council's rules of procedure, in the order in which they were submitted.

Then, Jebb said that the Soviet Union claimed that the Security Council member states were acting according to the will of the United States. This is simply an "unprovoked attack." He said that if the Security Council changes the order of voting on the two proposals before it, it would not violate Rule 32. Jebb suggested voting on the question of whether the U.S. proposal or the Soviet proposal should be considered first. Indian Representative Rau said that he would abstain on the question of which proposal should be voted on first. Egyptian Representative Fawzi said that he would support the suggestion to vote on the U.S. proposal first, because the Security Council can make its own decisions, so it can modify the order of voting. Fawzi also said that if the Soviet proposal is put to a vote first, he would vote against the Soviet proposal. Similarly, French Representative Chauvel asserted that the Security Council has the right to violate the rules of procedure.

Soviet Representative Malik then spoke again, saying that on September 11th, the U.S. delegation obstructed the adoption of a decision to invite representatives of the Chinese People's Government, and is now rushing to force others to accept the suggestion of establishing an investigation team. Malik insisted that there is no reason to amend Rule 32 on this issue.

Jebb then put the question to a vote. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Egypt, Norway, Ecuador, and Cuba supported the suggestion to vote on the U.S. proposal first, the Soviet Union voted against, and Yugoslavia and India abstained.

Jebb therefore announced that the simultaneous discussion of the two proposals would begin. Malik then spoke first and began the general discussion. He pointed out that the Security Council received two telegrams from Chinese Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on August 28th and 30th regarding the U.S. aggression against Chinese territory. Malik pointed out: The telegram of August 28th describes how U.S. military aircraft invaded the airspace of the People's Republic of China on August 27th, flying along the right bank of the Yalu River and strafing stations and houses, killing and injuring a number of Chinese people. The telegram went on to say: On the same day, two U.S. B-29 bombers circled over Ji'an city for more than ten minutes, and three U.S. P-51 aircraft and one Mosquito aircraft flew to the area of Dalizi, strafing the station. Malik also said: Another four U.S. military aircraft flew to the same area and strafed the station facilities with machine guns, injuring one driver and one resident. On the same day, one U.S. B-29 bomber flew over Andong city for reconnaissance. At 16:40, another two U.S. P-51 aircraft strafed for two minutes, injuring 19 workers, killing 3 workers, and destroying 2 trucks. Malik then pointed out: Zhou Enlai's telegram of August 30th reported that U.S. military aircraft invaded Chinese airspace on August 29th and killed and injured a number of Chinese people. Malik then emphasized that Zhou Enlai believes that these provocative acts are the most serious acts of infringing on Chinese sovereignty. Malik continued, Austin, in his statement to the Security Council on August 31st, did not deny that U.S. aircraft had violated China's border airspace and strafed Chinese airfields. The Security Council must condemn these illegal acts on the part of the United States and must hold the United States fully responsible for all responsibilities and consequences. The Security Council must demand that the United States avoid repeating such actions. The Soviet Union believes that the adoption of the Soviet proposal will promote peace and security.

As for the U.S. proposal, Malik pointed out that the U.S. representative admitted in his letter to the Security Council on August 31st that the United States had violated China's borders and caused damage. Malik emphasized that Lie had sent the U.S. letter to Zhou Enlai. Therefore, it is also an admission that the United States invaded Chinese territory. Malik declared: Therefore, there is no need to establish any investigation team to investigate this incident. Austin's stubborn opposition to the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the Chinese People's Government to attend the Security Council proves that the United States is afraid of a full investigation. He further said that the United States is trying to bypass the Security Council, prevent the Security Council from conducting any detailed discussion of this issue, and not allow the Security Council to listen to the opinions of Chinese representatives.

Malik reiterated that the U.S. opposition to inviting Chinese representatives to attend the Security Council violates the United Nations Charter, the Security Council's rules of procedure, and precedent. The United States is trying to obstruct the investigation, divert people's attention from U.S. acts of aggression, and drag out the issue. In further explaining the U.S. motives, Malik stated that the United States' ultimate hope is to place its personnel in the investigation team to act as spies within China.

Malik continued, the United States' expressed willingness to compensate for losses and its attempt to portray this as a generous act is not the first time. It is time to expose these attempts to conceal their crimes with hypocritical generosity. The following things cannot be concealed: First, the United States violated international law; Second, the United States committed acts of aggression, causing many lives to be lost. No amount of dollars can compensate for the loss of life caused by the United States' inhumane and barbaric bombing of the Chinese people, nor can dollars bring these people back to life.

Malik then read out numerous telegrams sent by various Chinese people's organizations. The telegrams all supported Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, demanding that the Security Council stop U.S. aggression and protect the legitimate rights of the Chinese people. Malik said that these telegrams represent the voice of the Chinese people. Malik mentioned that Austin expressed surprise at Zhou Enlai's statement that the Chinese People's Government would consider any decision on the Chinese accusation passed by the Security Council without the participation of representatives of the Chinese people to be illegal, and said that this is a legitimate statement of an unyielding people.

In conclusion, Malik asked: If a matter concerning the United States is discussed without the U.S. government's consent or participation, would the U.S. government be willing to accept the Security Council's decision to send an investigation team to U.S. territory?

Austin later tried in vain to reply to Malik, saying that "Malik's attack" on the United States was intended to "split" the Security Council and weaken the Security Council's ability to resist some imagined "Soviet aggression." Austin declared that Malik's sharp rebukes to the United States would have an incalculable impact on public opinion. He continued to threaten that if the Security Council allows the Soviet Union to succeed in this tactic, then every country will have to deal with the Soviet Union individually. After delivering this speech, Austin requested the Security Council to vote on the U.S. proposal on September 12th.

Indian Representative Rau said that India would abstain when voting on the U.S. proposal because, as he had previously stated, the U.S. proposal asked India to serve as a member of the investigation team. If the Security Council passes the U.S. proposal, India will appoint appropriate representatives, but without China's cooperation, the investigation team clearly cannot effectively perform its duties. Then Rau declared that he would vote against the Soviet proposal because it supposedly condemned the United States without any preliminary investigation.

After the representatives of Ecuador and the Kuomintang delivered speeches repeating Austin's argument about the "necessity of investigation," Malik said that what he said about fascist heads and spies only referred to the actions of the United States.

Next, Jebb announced the vote on the U.S. proposal. The Soviet Union voted against the U.S. proposal; Yugoslavia and India abstained; the Kuomintang representative did not participate in the vote. All other countries voted in favor of the proposal. The proposal was therefore rejected because a permanent member of the Security Council—the Soviet Union—voted against it.

Then, the Security Council voted on the Soviet proposal. The Soviet Union voted in favor of the proposal, Yugoslavia abstained, the Kuomintang representative did not participate in the vote, and all others voted against.

After the vote, Jebb attempted to announce a recess until Monday, September 18th. But Malik emphasized that the Security Council still has the agenda item regarding the accusation of aggression against Taiwan, and urged the Security Council to consider inviting representatives of the Chinese People's Government to participate in the discussion of this agenda item.

In order to achieve his intention and adjourn the Security Council until September 18th, Jebb requested an immediate vote on the Soviet motion. But Malik pointed out that Jebb's request for a vote was a bit hasty, and said: Some representatives may want to discuss this issue.

At this time, Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu moved to adjourn the meeting until September 18th. The U.S. bloc passed this motion with a mechanical majority.

### 美建议成立“调查团”案被否决

　　安理会审议我国控诉美机侵袭案
    美建议成立“调查团”案被否决
    马立克揭露美国企图借调查为名派间谍来我国
    并指出野蛮扫射造成的生命损失用多少美元都赔偿不了
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十三日讯：安理会九月十二日会议开始审议中华人民共和国政府控诉美国轰炸中国领土案。在这一方面，安理会面前有两个决议草案：一、苏联谴责这些非法行动以及要求美国予以禁止的提案；二、美国建议成立调查团调查轰炸事件的提案。
    虽然中国人民政府已提出控诉案，但美国在其卫星国的帮助下已于九月十一日使苏联关于安理会应邀请中国政府代表出席并听取其陈述意见的建议不能通过。而且，虽然苏联提案是在八月三十一日提出的，而美国提案则是于九月一日提出的，但美国代表团仍力图使安理会首先审议美国提案。在会议开始时，安理会主席杰伯承认，安理会如果首先审议美国提案，就有背于安理会程序规则。他建议安理会首先就苏美两国提案的问题，举行一般性的讨论，然后决定首先表决何项提案。美国代表奥斯汀继而露骨地倡导违犯安理会规则，敦促安理会首先表决美国的提案。
    杰伯以联合王国代表资格发言，支持美国要安理会先表决美国提案、然后表决苏联提案的请求。
    苏联代表马立克于是严词答复奥斯汀说，奥斯汀的论点是没有根据的。他说，奥斯汀请求尽先审议美国提案的建议，不但没有节省安理会时间，而且实际上已妨碍了讨论。马立克说，安理会应遵循程序规则，按照提出的先后次序审议重大提案。苏联的提案是首先提出的，因此应该首先表决。美国很久以来就采取违犯宪章与安理会程序规则的方针，现在又开动机械的表决机器，企图再度违犯程序规则。美国代表团并且不惜强奸事实。马立克在答复奥斯汀九月十一日所称苏联强把轰炸中国领土案列入安理会议程的说法时说，全世界都知道，这一问题以及侵犯台湾问题是中国人民政府向安理会提出的。奥斯汀的论点不符合实际。马立克指出，苏联代表在八月份以安理会主席的资格正当地把中国政府的控诉案提到安理会上。关于奥斯汀所谓把这些项目列入议程是为了毁损在朝鲜的“联合国部队”的声誉的说法，马立克指出，这一说法也是不符合实际的。他说，对朝鲜人民进行侵略的是美国武装部队，而不是“联合国部队”。
    马立克进一步回答奥斯汀说：两案之列入安理会议程证明美国不仅是对朝鲜的侵略者，而且是对中国台湾和东北的侵略者。美国统治集团在干涉朝鲜战争之后，继续侵犯台湾，并袭击中国和平居民，从而扩大了侵略。美国代表团在阻挠了邀请中国代表前来安理会的建议案之后，现在又企图强迫安理会接受其提案。马立克指出，如果没有当事国参加，安理会显然是不能决定派遣调查团到任何国家去的。美国惯于不征询有关国家的意见就派遣其特使与使团去到它所愿意去的地方。但是自由的人民是不能允许美国在各地区的法西斯头目们与间谍们到他们所愿意去的地方的。他说，美国是建议安理会接受美国的无耻的方法，不征询中国人民政府意见，不得其同意，即派遣调查团到中国去。美国不仅仅提出这个提案，而且企图以非常的仓促的议事程序，强迫人家接受它的提案。安理会必须不采取这一非法的方针。
    在回答奥斯汀所说安理会目前缺乏有关美国轰炸中国的充分材料一节时，马立克指出，周恩来致安理会的各项电文中即包括了关于这一情况的材料。他并说，安理会还听到奥斯汀承认美国飞机侵犯中国领空。奥斯汀企图提出“情有可原的情况”，但没有否认美国的袭击。马立克继而问道，谁不让安理会获得更多的事实呢？他说，阻挠中国参加安理会会议的是美国。马立克指出奥斯汀的态度前后矛盾，并说：如果不是美国阻止安理会邀请中国的话，安理会老早就获得了一切事实。马立克结语说：苏联代表团认为讨论苏美两国提案是合理的，但这些提案应按照安理会程序规则，按其提出的先后次序予以表决。
    于是，杰伯说，苏联声称安理会理事国系按照美国的意志行动。这简直是“无端的攻击”。他说，安理会如果改变表决它面前的两项提案的次序，并不会违犯第三十二条规则。杰伯建议表决究竟应首先审议美国提案还是先审议苏联提案的问题。印度代表劳氏说，在究竟应首先表决那一提案的问题上，他将弃权。埃及代表法齐说，他将支持首先表决美国提案的建议，因为安理会是可以自己作主的，因此它能够修改表决的次序。法齐并说，如果苏联提案首先提付表决的话，他将投票反对苏联提案。同样地，法国代表萧维尔断言，安理会有权违背程序规则。
    苏联代表马立克继起发言说，在九月十一日，美国代表团阻挠采取邀请中国人民政府代表的决定，现在又慌忙企图强迫人家接受设立调查团的建议。马立克坚称，在这一问题上修正第三十二条规则毫无理由。
    杰伯继而即将问题提付表决。美国、英国、法国、埃及、挪威、厄瓜多尔和古巴支持关于首先表决美国提案的建议，苏联投反对票，南斯拉夫和印度弃权。
    杰伯因而宣布开始同时讨论两个提案。于是马立克首先发言开始了一般的讨论。他指出安理会收到中国外交部长周恩来八月二十八日和三十日关于美国侵略中国领土的两项来电。马立克指出：八月二十八日的来电叙述美国军用飞机在八月二十七日侵入中华人民共和国领空、沿鸭绿江右岸飞行并扫射车站和房屋、杀伤若干中国人的情况。该电进而说到：同日，美国Ｂ——２９轰炸机两架在辑安城上空盘旋十余分钟，另有美国Ｐ——５１飞机三架及蚊式飞机一架飞抵大栗子地区上空，扫射车站。马立克又说：另有美国军用飞机四架飞抵同一地区，并以机枪扫射车站设备，伤司机一人，居民一人。同日，美国Ｂ——２９轰炸机一架飞抵安东城上空侦察。在十六时四十分，又有美国Ｐ——５１飞机两架扫射两分钟，伤工人十九名，打死工人三名，击坏卡车两辆。马立克于是指出：周恩来的八月三十日的来电报告：美国军用飞机在八月二十九日侵入中国领空，并杀伤中国人民若干名。马立克随后强调说，周恩来认为这些挑衅行为是侵犯中国主权的最严重的行为。马立克继续说，奥斯汀在其八月三十一日向安理会发表的声明中并未否认美国飞机曾侵犯中国的边境领空和扫射中国飞机场。安理会必须谴责美国方面的这些非法的行为而且必须要美国担负全部责任和后果。安理会必须要求美国避免重演这种行动。苏联相信，通过苏联的提案，就会促进和平与安全。
    至于美国的提案，马立克指出，美国代表在其八月三十一日致安理会的公函中承认美国曾侵犯中国的边境而且造成损害。马立克强调说，赖伊曾把美国的来函送交周恩来。因此，也就是承认美国侵犯了中国领土。马立克宣称：因此，没有必要成立任何调查团来调查这一事件。奥斯汀顽强地反对苏联所提邀请中国人民政府代表出席安理会的提案，这证明美国害怕充分的调查。他进一步说，美国企图越过安理会，阻止安理会对这问题作任何详尽的讨论，并且不允许安理会倾听中国代表陈述意见。
    马立克重申，美国反对邀请中国代表出席安理会，违背了联合国宪章、安理会程序规则和先例。美国力图阻挠调查，转移人们对美国侵略行为的注意力，并且把问题拖下去。马立克在进一步说明美国的动机时表示，美国最后的希望是把自己的人员安插在调查团中，在中国境内充当间谍。
    马立克继续说，美国表示愿意赔偿损失与力图把这说成是慷慨的行动，这不是第一次。现在是揭穿这些用虚伪的慷慨掩饰其罪行的企图的时候了。下面的事情是无法掩饰的：第一，美国违犯了国际法；第二，美国犯有侵略行为，造成许多生命的损失。美国非人道地野蛮地轰炸中国人民所造成的生命损失用多少美元都赔偿不了的，美元也不能够使这些人复活。
    马立克继即宣读中国各个人民团体拍来的无数电报。电报都支持周恩来外长，要求安理会制止美国的侵略及保障中国人民的合法权利。马立克说，这些电报代表了中国人民的声音。马立克提到奥斯汀对周恩来所说中国人民政府将认为安理会如果在没有中国人民的代表参加之下通过的有关中国控诉案的任何决定都将是非法的一点表示惊奇，并说，这是不屈的人民的合法声明。
    马立克在结语时问道：如果不经美国政府同意或没有美国参加就讨论有关美国的问题，美国政府是否愿意接受安理会派遣调查团进入美国领土的决定呢？
    奥斯汀后来徒然地企图答复马立克，他说：“马立克攻击”美国是想“分裂”安全理事会，并削弱安理会抵抗某种想像中的“苏联侵略”的力量。奥斯汀宣称，马立克对美国的尖锐的斥责会对舆论发生无法计算的影响。他继续恫吓说，如果安理会使苏联这种战术成功，那么，每个国家就不得不单个地对付苏联。在发表了这篇演说后，奥斯汀要求安理会于九月十二日表决美国的提案。
    印度代表劳氏说，在表决美国提案时，印度将弃权，因为，一如他先前提出的，美国提案请印度担任调查团的一员。如果安理会通过美国的提案，印度将指派适当的代表，但如果没有中国的合作，调查团显然不能有效地执行职务。然后劳氏又声明他将投票反对苏联的提案，因为据说该提案未经任何初步的调查就斥责美国。
    在厄瓜多尔代表及国民党代表发表演说重复奥斯汀关于“调查的必要性”的论点之后，马立克说，他所说关于法西斯头目与间谍人员的话，只是指美国的行为。
    接着，杰伯宣布表决美国提案。苏联投票反对美国提案；南斯拉夫和印度弃权；国民党代表没有参加表决。所有其他国家都投票赞成该提案。提案因而被否决，因为安理会一常任理事国——苏联——投票反对。
    然后，安理会表决苏联提案。苏联投票赞成该提案，南斯拉夫弃权，国民党代表未参加投票，其他都投票反对。
    杰伯在表决后企图宣布休会到九月十八日星期一。但是马立克强调指出，安理会面前仍然有关于控诉侵略台湾的议程，并敦促安理会考虑邀请中国人民政府代表参加讨论这项议程。
    为了实现他的意图并使安理会休会到九月十八日，杰伯即要求立即表决苏联的动议。但马立克指出杰伯要求表决稍嫌仓促，并说：若干代表可能要讨论这个问题。
    这时，国民党代表蒋廷黻动议休会到九月十八日。美国集团乃以机械的多数通过了这个动议。
