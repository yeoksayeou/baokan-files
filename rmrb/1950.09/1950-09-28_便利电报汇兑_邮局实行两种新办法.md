　　Convenient Telegraphic Money Order
    Post Office Implements Two New Methods
    In order to alleviate the burden on telegraphic money order remitters and facilitate the cashing of telegraphic money orders for recipients, the Beijing Postal Administration Bureau and its subordinate bureaus have recently implemented two registration methods for telegraphic money orders: "Code Name and Code Word" and "Held for Collection Telegraphic Transfer."
    If remitters who frequently use postal telegraphic transfers fill out an application form and register the recipient's name and address with the post office, the post office will compile the recipient's name and address into a "Code Name and Code Word." In the future, when issuing a telegraphic money order to the recipient from the post office, the "Code Name and Code Word" registered with the post office can be used instead of the recipient's name and address, saving on telegraphic fees.
    If recipients who frequently receive postal telegraphic money orders register their name, address, and telephone number with the post office, leave a pre-approved seal impression, and submit a guarantee, the post office will issue a "Held for Collection Telegraphic Transfer Registration Certificate." After the above registration, the recipient can notify the remitter to use "Held for Collection at [Name of Post Office] ○○○" (i.e., the recipient's name) instead of the recipient's name and address when issuing the telegraphic money order.
    For this type of "Held for Collection Telegraphic Money Order," the post office can notify the recipient by telephone to bring the registration certificate and seal impression to collect the money directly, without the need for additional guarantee procedures.

　　便利电报汇兑
    邮局实行两种新办法
    北京邮政管理局及其所属各局为减轻电报汇票汇款人负担及便利受款人兑取电报汇票，最近已实行电报汇兑“代号代字”及“留交电汇”两种登记办法。
    经常利用邮政电汇之汇款人如将受款人姓名，住址填具申请书在邮局登记后，即由邮局将受款人之姓名，住址编成“代号代字”。以后如向邮局开发受款人之电报汇票时，即可用在邮局登记之“代号代字”代替受款人姓名、住址。可以节省电报费。
    经常接收邮政电报汇票之收款人如在邮局将姓名，住址及电话号码登记，并预留印鉴，缴存保证书后，即由邮局发给“留交电汇登记证”一份。经过上述登记后，受款人可通知汇款人用“留交某某局○○○”（即受款人姓名），代替受款人姓名、住址。开发电报汇票。
    邮局对于此项“留交电报汇票”可以用电话通知受款人携带登记证及印鉴迳来取款，毋须另备保证手续。
