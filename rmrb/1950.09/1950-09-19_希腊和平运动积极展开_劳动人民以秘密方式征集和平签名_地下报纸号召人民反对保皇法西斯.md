Xinhua News Agency, 16th: According to broadcasts from the Free Greece Radio Station: Despite the brutal suppression by the royalist fascist government, the Greek people's movement to defend peace continues to make progress. In Athens and Piraeus, thousands of working people are secretly collecting signatures for peace. At a factory in Piraeus, 95 percent of the workers have secretly signed the peace declaration. One young peace supporter collected 300 signatures on his own. Even in the army, a peace signature movement is underway, with 280 soldiers from one unit signing.

   A large number of underground newspapers and leaflets are being published and circulated in Athens and Piraeus, calling on the people to fight to thwart the war plans of the American and British imperialists and their royalist fascist lackeys. These newspapers include: "Fighter for Freedom and Peace," published by young workers; "Banner," of the Youth Peace Supporters Front; "Proletarian," of the Communist Party of Piraeus; and "Youth," of the Greek Youth Resistance Organization, etc.

   In the city of Piraeus, several thousand leaflets were distributed a few days ago, reading: "Greeks will not shed a drop of blood in Korea!" "Hold general elections based on proportional representation!" "Implement amnesty, support democratic independence and peace!".

    劳动人民以秘密方式征集和平签名  地下报纸号召人民反对保皇法西斯
    【新华社十六日讯】据自由希腊电台广播：虽然有保皇法西斯政府的残酷镇压，希腊人民为保卫和平而斗争的运动，仍不断获得进展。在雅典与比里犹斯两地，成千的劳动人民以秘密方式征集着和平签名。比里犹斯某工厂，已有百分之九十五的工人，秘密地在和平宣言上签了名。有一个青年和平拥护者，独自就征集了三百人签名。甚至在军队中和平签名运动也在进行，有一个部队就曾有士兵二百八十人签名。
    雅典与比里犹斯出版并流传着大量的地下报纸与传单，号召人民为挫败美英帝国主义者及其保皇法西斯奴仆的战争计划而斗争。这些报纸中有：劳动青年的《争取自由与和平战士报》，青年和平拥护者阵线的《旗帜报》，比里犹斯共产党的《无产者报》，希腊青年抵抗运动组织的《青年报》等等。
    在比里犹斯城内，前几天并有人散发了数千张传单，写着：“希腊人决不在朝鲜流一滴血！”“根据比例制，举行大选！”“实行大赦，拥护民主独立、和平！”。
