　　The Clever and Brave Sang Jinqiu
    "Under any circumstances, with the leadership of the Party and the strength of the masses, victory can be achieved."
    Hu Zheng
    Comrade Sang Jinqiu, throughout the entire People's Liberation War, fought from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain to the frontier, from the Northeast to the Southwest. The war transformed him from a puppet soldier into a Communist Party member, from a soldier to a deputy battalion commander, from the son of an ordinary poor peasant to a people's hero. The experiences and changes in this heroic journey are extremely rich.
    During the final counter-offensive of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Jinqiu appeared on the city wall of Caoxian with a tenacious heroic posture. That time, he served as a shock trooper three times in a row. The first two times failed to achieve the goal, and the third time he participated in the assault team of a friendly neighboring regiment as a representative of the entire company. Due to their unparalleled bravery, they completed the task of breaking through the city wall, allowing our army to quickly eliminate the Japanese invaders and puppet troops defending the city, and Caoxian was recovered that night. At that time, Comrade Jinqiu was a new soldier who had been liberated from the puppet army for just over a month. Although he had not received Party education for long, he quickly became aware, so he received praise from the masses and commendations from his superiors in his first battle. But this was only the prelude to the hero's meritorious deeds.
    Sang Jinqiu not only displayed unparalleled bravery in attacking fortified positions, but also showed unparalleled tenacity in defending them. In the Pinghan Campaign in October 1945, their task was to defend Shawo, cut off the enemy, and cooperate with friendly neighboring regiments to capture Zhangbei. The enemy launched six consecutive attacks, all of which were crushed by them. At this time, the entire company suffered heavy losses, with all cadres above the squad level killed or wounded, leaving only thirty-eight people including the cooks. They had to hold the entire company's position. The enemy was still organizing charges. Everyone temporarily formed two squads, and elected Comrade Sang Jinqiu to command the second squad, taking on the most dangerous position. If this position were broken through by the enemy, the victorious attack of the friendly neighbors could not be guaranteed. But they finally crushed the enemy's final assault. In the end, only he and Li Jingui were left in Sang Jinqiu's squad.
    This tenacious heroic spirit was also demonstrated in several fierce battles during the advance into the frontier. The first time was in February 1946. Comrade Sang Jinqiu served as the leader of the combat group. Their regiment was blocking the enemy on Suda Mountain between Chengde and Pingquan. This was the most frantic period for the enemy. The formidable enemy facing them was the Chiang bandit's fully U.S.-equipped main force, the 13th Army. That early morning, the enemy used twenty cannons to cover an entire company of troops, launching a fierce attack on their squad's position. The shells exploded, filling the mountain with smoke, making it impossible to see people. By the time people could be seen, the enemy had already rushed in front of them. Under these circumstances, they repelled two full-company assaults by the enemy. Then the enemy organized more than a hundred officers above the rank of lieutenant and a battalion of reserves to make a third desperate attack. This group of enemies kept crawling up, regardless of how the machine guns swept them. At that time, they had only five comrades left. Facing this emergency situation, some people panicked. Comrade Sang Jinqiu immediately put forward a powerful slogan: "We have already defeated their two assaults, and we will definitely defeat them this time!" He quickly told everyone to take all the grenades from the bodies of the killed and wounded comrades. Sure enough, when the enemy climbed to thirty meters from the position, they were repelled by a fierce explosion.
    The enemy's final vigor was suppressed. They looked back and saw that the main force had already left. Comrade Jinqiu and his four comrades looked at each other and smiled with relief. Because they had completed the task of covering the main force's transfer. In this battle, Comrade Jinqiu was selected as a first-class hero in killing the enemy.
    The second time was during the Red Stone Station battle in the Rehe Eastern Campaign in April 1946. The focal point of the battle was on the stone bridge in front of the station. The enemy was guarding the bridgehead with two heavy machine guns. The assault squad chose the riverbed gully five hundred meters away from the bridge as the starting point for the assault. The assault began at dusk. They ran to the grave mounds in front of the bridge and lay down. This was the area with the most intense enemy fire, and they could not stay there for long. Comrade Jinqiu then led his group, threw a row of grenades, and took advantage of the explosion smoke to rush to the enemy and seize the enemy's American-made rifles. The enemy panicked, and the second and third platoons immediately came up from both wings and seized the bridgehead position. The troops suffered no casualties that time and successfully controlled the station. This was the result of Comrade Jinqiu's bravery and cleverness. The regimental headquarters recorded a second major merit.
    In 1947, not long after Sang Jinqiu entered the Dabie Mountains with the troops, on a rainy night in September, the army engaged in battle with the enemy on the mountains near the Popi River. The regimental headquarters ordered the stretcher platoon leader Gao Yugui and the nursing leader Shi Xincheng to lead twenty-two wounded and sick soldiers and medical support personnel to the military hospital in the direction of Baiqueyuan. Comrade Jinqiu was seriously ill at the time and was lying on a stretcher. But they ran into the enemy halfway, and the hospital had already been moved. The enemy situation in the Dabie Mountains was serious at the time. This group of wounded and sick soldiers, who had lost command and support, had no medicine or supplies, were getting farther and farther away from the main force, and were being chased and surrounded by the enemy everywhere. At this time, everyone's thoughts were naturally confused. So Comrade Jinqiu proposed to organize the branch, establish Party leadership, in order to overcome difficulties and find the main force. Under his active suggestion at the time, a branch committee was established as the leadership core. Six groups were also formed, dividing the work and helping each other to prepare food, armed self-defense, and do mass work. After the organization was rectified, everyone had support and their morale was high. They placed four seriously ill patients in the homes of the common people in the mountains, and then advanced into the deep mountains in the southeast. At that time, Comrade Jinqiu was still very ill, but he still personally led everyone to cross mountains and ridges, preparing food while marching.
    The situation became increasingly serious: the enemy was searching and looting everywhere, and the people were evacuating to leave empty houses. Food was even more difficult, and it was common to go without food all day. On August 14th, they were chased by the enemy into a mountain gully. The situation forced them to continue to break through, but everyone was too hungry to walk, and the wounded and sick soldiers could not walk even more. They had no choice but to pick some pumpkins on the spot, dig a hole in the pumpkins, and divide the little bit of rice that had been stored for a long time to everyone, and pour it into the pumpkins to cook. The rice was cooked and the pumpkins were also cooked. The wounded and sick soldiers ate the rice, and they ate the pumpkins. They circled the enemy in the mountains like this. They hadn't tasted salt for more than twenty days. One day they found a handful of salt, and everyone gathered around to look at it. What a rare treasure! But after a serious study by the branch committee for a long time, it was decided not to eat it, but to leave it for the wounded to wash their wounds. During the day, they had to climb mountains barefoot because they had no shoes. At night, they camped on the hillside without blankets, so they had to cover themselves with straw. After three months of this fighting life, everyone's injuries and illnesses had also improved. In the fourth month, they found the Jinxi County People's Government. They accepted the leadership of the Party, formally established the county's guard company, and were responsible for opening up the work of one district.
    Comrade Jinqiu was appointed as the deputy company commander. Under his command, they conducted three months of guerrilla warfare. They fought eight battles in total. Under Sang Jinqiu's flexible and mobile command, not only were there no casualties, but the number of people increased from sixty-four to eighty-four. It was not until February 1948 that they crossed the Huai River to the north and returned to the army under the warm welcome of the entire regiment. Sang Jinqiu was then promoted to company commander of the first company.
    After this severe test in the Dabie Mountains, Sang Jinqiu became more robust. So in the Huaihai Campaign and the Chengdu Campaign, he gave even greater play to his genius for heroic command and leadership.
    During the first stage of the Huaihai Campaign, the task of their regiment was: to block the Chiang bandit's main force, the 12th Army, on the banks of the Fei River, and to cover our main force in deploying a huge pocket-shaped formation to completely wipe out the enemy. The company commanded by Sang Jinqiu built fortifications near Banqiao. This was the enemy's main attack direction. The regimental headquarters conveyed the order: build the fortifications firmly, and prepare to deal with a thousand enemy shells and ten aircraft bombings tomorrow. After receiving the task, the company commander held a meeting to mobilize all the commanders and fighters to complete six bunkers and one shelter for each person, as well as all the communication trenches, overnight. At the same time, he called on everyone to dig while discussing how to complete the task. The soldiers had not slept for three days and three nights, but because the company commander worked and discussed with them, they completed the task before dark, and before dark they also distributed the fire boundaries and tasks of each squad and platoon. At noon the next day, the enemy began to attack. The enemy first concentrated dozens of cannons and three bombers to bombard the positions around Banqiao, and also deployed several groups of light and heavy machine guns to block their bunker gun holes. The enemy used an entire battalion of troops to pounce on the position, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Sang Jinqiu ordered all the machine guns to be transferred from the bunkers to the positions that had been selected in advance to wait for firing. When the enemy rushed in front of the position, with a command, all the firepower was suppressed, causing severe casualties to the enemy. So this fierce attack by the enemy was completely bankrupt again.
    Although the enemy had been repelled, Sang Jinqiu was seriously injured. No matter who tried to persuade him, he resolutely refused to leave the front line. When the deputy battalion commander personally went to the position to see him, he could no longer speak. He had no choice but to use his blood-stained finger to write the name of the person who would take his position on the ground: "Yuan Qifeng". The deputy battalion commander, on behalf of the Party, ordered him to go down, and then he lay on a stretcher and was carried to the rear.
    During the Chengdu Campaign, Sang Jinqiu had been promoted to deputy battalion commander. He personally led a company and miraculously rushed into the central position of the enemy's four armies. After quickly wiping out a battalion, he disrupted the enemy's deployment on the enemy's position, causing the enemy to panic and waver, and attracted the enemy's artillery fire to his own surroundings, allowing our main force to smoothly and completely wipe out the enemy's four armies.
    The Liu-Deng Army, which was honored as the "Four-War Army," like other fraternal units, has cultivated thousands upon thousands of outstanding heroes. Comrade Sang Jinqiu is one of them. He has been credited five times and selected as a first-class combat hero four times in these important battlefields of the frontier, the Dabie Mountains, the Huaihai, and the liberation of the Southwest, and in the entire People's Liberation War. When he summed up his own experience, he said: A good combatant, as long as he combines bravery and flexibility well, can protect himself and kill the enemy. A good commander, as long as he combines determination and meticulousness well, can win battles. But what he realizes most deeply is: under any circumstances, with the leadership of the Party and the strength of the masses, victory can be achieved. He said that his honors today are all the merits of the Party and the masses. (Attached picture)

　　机灵勇敢的桑金秋
    “在任何情况下，有了党的领导和群众的力量，就能得到胜利。”
    胡征
    桑金秋同志在整个人民解放战争中，从冀鲁豫平原打到塞外，从东北打到西南，战争把他从伪军改造成共产党员，从战士提升到副营长，从一个普通贫农的儿子培养成一个人民的英雄。这一条英雄道路中的经历和变化是太丰富了。
    金秋同志在抗日战争的最后反攻中，就以顽强的英雄姿态出现在曹县的城头上。那回他连续担任三次突击手。头两次没达到目的，第三次作为全连的代表参加了友邻团的突击队。由于他们无比的英勇，完成了突破城墙的任务，使我们大军得以迅速地消灭了守城的日寇和伪军，当夜就把曹县收复了。那时候，金秋同志是刚由伪军解放过来一个多月的新战士。虽受党的教育时间不长，而他觉悟得很快，所以在首次战斗中就获得群众的赞颂和上级的通令表扬，但这仅仅是英雄立功业迹的序幕。
    桑金秋不但在攻坚中显示了无比的英勇，而且在坚守中也表现出无比的顽强。一九四五年十月的平汉战役中，他们的任务是坚守沙窝，割断敌人，配合友邻团攻取张北。敌人连续六次攻击，都被他们打垮了。这时候全连损失很重，班以上的干部伤亡已尽，连炊事员只剩下了三十八人，必须守住全连的阵地。敌人还在继续组织冲锋。大家临时组成两个班，选桑金秋同志指挥二班，担任最险要的阵地。如果这个阵地被敌人突破，那就不能保证友邻胜利地进攻。可是他们终于把敌人的最后突击打垮了。最后桑金秋的班只剩下他和李金桂两个人。
    这种顽强的英雄气魄，又表现在挺进塞外的几场激烈的战斗中。第一次是一九四六年二月。桑金秋同志担任战斗组长。他们团在承德与平泉之间的苏大山上阻击敌人。这时是敌人最疯狂的时期。迎面的劲敌，是蒋匪全副美械装备的主力十三军。那天清早，敌人用二十门大炮掩护一个整连的兵力，向他们一个班的阵地猛攻。炮弹炸得满山烟雾，看不见人。到看见人的时候，敌人已冲到面前了。就在这种情况下，他们打退了敌人的两次整连冲锋。接着敌人组织了百多名尉级以上的军官和一个营的后备队来作第三次的挣扎猛扑。这一伙敌人，不管机枪如何扫射，一直弯着腰往上爬。当时他们只剩下五个同志。面对这个紧急情况，有人惊慌起来。桑金秋同志马上提出有力的口号：“我们已经打垮他两次冲锋，这次一定能把他打垮！”迅速叫大家把伤亡同志身上的手榴弹全部拿来。果然不错，敌人爬到离阵地三十米的时候，被一阵猛烈的爆炸轰退了。
    敌人最后的锐气压了下去。他们回头一望，主力已经走了。金秋同志和他的四个战友互相看看，都安心地笑了起来。因为他们已完成了掩护主力转移的任务。这次战斗，金秋同志被选为一等杀敌英雄。
    第二次是一九四六年四月热东战役，攻取红石车站的时候。战斗的集中点，是在车站前面的石桥上。敌人用两挺重机枪守着桥头。突击班选择离桥五百米的河滩沟作冲锋出发地。黄昏时开始冲锋。他们跑到桥前的坟堆后爬下了。这是敌人火力最紧的地方，不可久停。金秋同志就带着他的一个组扔出一排手榴弹，乘爆炸的烟雾冲到敌人跟前，夺下敌人的美造步枪。敌人惊慌了，二三两排随即从两翼上来夺下了桥头阵地。那次部队没有伤亡，顺利地控制了车站。这是金秋同志英勇和机灵的结果。团部给记了第二次大功。
    一九四七年，桑金秋随部队进入大别山不久，在九月的一个雨夜，大军在泼皮河附近的山上和敌人展开战斗。团部命令担架排长高玉贵和看护长史心诚带领二十二个伤病号和医务杂务人员，送往白雀园方向的随军医院。金秋同志当时病重，躺在担架上。可是半路碰见敌人，并且医院已经转移。当时大别山敌情严重。这一群失掉指挥失掉依靠的伤病员，既无医药又无给养，和主力越离越远，又到处遭敌人的追击和包围。这时候大家的思想混乱是很自然的。于是金秋同志提出把支部组织起来，建立党的领导，才能克服困难，找到主力。当时在他积极的建议下成立起支委会，作为领导核心。又编了六个小组，分工互助进行筹备粮食、武装自卫以及作群众工作。组织整顿好了，大家有了依靠，情绪都高了。他们把四个重病号寄放在大山里面老百姓家里，然后向东南方深山里挺进。当时金秋同志的病还是很重，可是他仍然亲自领导大家翻山越岭，一面行军一面筹备粮食。
    情况越来越严重：敌人到处搜抢，人民都空室清野转移了。粮食更加困难，整天吃不上饭是常事。八月十四那天，他们被敌人追到大山沟里，情况是逼迫着继续突围，可是大家饿得不行，伤病员更不能走，只好就地摘些南瓜，在瓜上挖个洞，把保存了很久的一点米分给大家，灌在瓜里来烧饭。米煮熟了瓜也烧好了，伤病员吃饭，他们吃瓜。他们就这样在大山里面和敌人转圈，已经二十多天没尝到盐味了，有一天找到了一把盐，大家都围起来看。这是多稀罕的宝贝啊！可是最后经过支委会严肃地研究了很久，决定不吃，留给伤员洗伤口。白天，没有鞋子只好打赤脚爬山。夜晚在山坡上露营没有被子，只好盖稻草。这样战斗的生活经过了三个月，大家的伤和病也好了。第四个月的时候，他们找到了金西县人民政府。他们接受了党的领导，正式成立县的警卫连，并负责开辟一个区的工作。
    金秋同志被任为副连长。在他的指挥下，又进行了三个月的游击战。前后战斗八次，在桑金秋灵活机动的指挥下，不但没有一个伤亡，而且由六十四人发展到八十四人。直至一九四八年二月，他们北渡淮河，才在全团的欢迎下归建了。于是桑金秋随即被升为第一连连长。
    经过这次大别山严重的考验，桑金秋锻炼得更结实了。于是在淮海战役和成都战役中，更高地发挥了英雄指挥与领导的天才。
    淮海战役第一阶段时，他们团的任务是：在淝河岸上阻击蒋匪主力十二兵团，掩护我们主力布置巨大的袋形阵地好全部消灭敌人。桑金秋指挥的连队在板桥附近构筑工事。这是敌人的主攻方向。团部传达命令说：把工事筑牢，明天准备应付敌人的一千发炮弹和十架飞机的轰炸。接受任务后，连长开会动员全体指战员，连夜完成六个碉堡和每人一个掩体，以及全部交通沟。同时号召大家一面挖，一面展开讨论如何完成任务。战士们已经是三天三夜没睡觉，但因连长和他们一起工作和讨论，天黑前就完成了任务，并且乘天黑前分配好各班排的火力界限和任务。第二天正午，敌人开始进攻。敌人事先集中了几十门大炮和三架轰炸机向板桥一带阵地轰击，又布置了几组轻重机枪封锁他们的碉堡枪眼。敌人用一个整营的兵力向阵地扑来，情况十分险恶。桑金秋命令把机枪全部从碉堡里面转到事先选好了的阵地上待命射击。等敌冲到阵地面前，一声命令，全部火力压下去，给敌人严重的杀伤。于是敌人这次猛攻又完全破产了。
    敌人虽已被打退，可是桑金秋却负了重伤。任何人劝，他都坚决不下火线。副营长亲自到阵地看他时，他已经不能说话了。只好用沾血的手指头在地上写着代理他职位的人的名字：“袁起凤”。副营长代表党命令他下去，这才躺上担架抬往后方。
    成都战役时，桑金秋已升任副营长。他亲自带领一个连，神奇地冲进敌人四个军的中心阵地，迅速消灭了一个营之后，在敌人阵地上打乱了敌人的部署，使敌人惊慌动摇，并把敌人的炮火吸引到自己周围，让我们的主力顺利地全部消灭了敌人四个军。
    被荣称“四战之军”的刘邓大军中，和其他的兄弟部队一样，培养出了千千万万出色的英雄。桑金秋同志就是其中的一个。他在塞外、大别山、淮海和解放西南这些重要的战场上，在整个人民解放战争中，曾立了五次功，四次被选为一等战斗英雄。他总结自己的经验时说：一个好的战斗员，只要把勇敢与灵活结合好，就能保己杀敌。一个好的指挥员，只要决心与细致结合好，就能打胜仗。但他体会最深的是：在任何情况下，有了党的领导和群众的力量，就能得到胜利。他说今天自己的这些荣誉，都是党和群众的功绩。（附图片）
