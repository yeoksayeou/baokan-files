　　Blasting Hero Huo Lantian
　　He is a resourceful and courageous demolition expert, and also a creator of engineering techniques. Under the Party's nurturing and education, he regards engineering as his lifelong career.
　　Comrade Huo Lantian, the blasting hero, is an outstanding hero in the engineering corps of the Fourth Field Army. He is from Boxing County, Shandong Province, and is 42 years old this year. He joined the army in June 1939 and has served as squad leader, platoon leader, staff officer, blasting instructor, etc. He is currently the captain of the engineering school of the Central and South Military Region.
　　During the late stage of the War of Resistance against Japan and the early stage of the Liberation War, we had to use inferior equipment to carry out siege warfare, seize Japanese strongholds, eliminate the American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek's army, and capture cities. Blasting replaced heavy artillery. Huo Lantian was a resourceful and courageous demolition expert, bravely active on the front lines of battle; he was also a creator of engineering techniques, which greatly facilitated the troops in siege warfare and reduced many unnecessary casualties.
　　In the summer of 1943, during the battle of Qiliba, a major stronghold of the Japanese and puppet troops in the Bohai area of Shandong, the enemy had three companies and very strong fortifications. We sent two blasting teams to carry out the mission, with Huo Lantian as the leader of the second team. When the first team carried explosives to charge the bunker, the explosives were unfortunately hit by the enemy, and the entire team heroically sacrificed. The dying enemy noticed the direction of our main attack and frantically opened fire, igniting patches of light around the outer trench. Two more demolitionists in Huo Lantian's team successively sacrificed, leaving only him. Huo Lantian proposed to Commander Wang, who was directing the battle, to "choose a place where the enemy's firepower is weak to carry out blasting." The battalion commander agreed. Under the cover of two special-class grenade throwers, he took off his clothes, barefooted, rolled in mud, and ran towards the predetermined target with explosives. The explosives exploded, blowing open a breach, enabling the troops to successfully complete the task of annihilating all the defending enemies. In this year alone, he blasted eleven solid enemy fortresses, and was awarded the title of "Blasting Hero" at the Shandong Bohai Military Region Hero Model Conference.
　　In the past siege battles, he relied on his combat experience to make many innovations in blasting technology. For example, sometimes the comrades felt that the breakthrough was too small and the hole was too low, making it inconvenient to charge. He imitated the "yangcha," a tool used by the common people for threshing, and created a "high fork" method for delivering explosives, which enlarged the blast opening. When our army attacked Wangjiaji, a demolitionist failed to complete the task of delivering explosives through the outer trench and instead fell into the outer trench. After pondering deeply, he created a "live fork" method for delivering explosives, so that demolitionists could blow up the enemy's walls without crossing the outer trench. Other tools for delivering explosives, such as "connecting rods," reduced casualties for the engineers in blasting, shortened the time to complete the task, and enhanced the blasting effect. In 1944, during the Zhangxu and Wangma campaigns, when our army used assault bridges to cross the trenches and approach the enemy, the enemy piled up a high ridge on the inner edge of the trench, making it easy for our troops crossing the trench to be shot down into the trench. To overcome this difficulty, he invented the "assault ladder," using a bridge to push the ladder, with the ladder carrying the bridge in continuous action to cross the trench and climb the earthen wall. In addition, he created the "somersault" and the "trench bridge" with shelters, enabling the assault troops to overcome enemy obstacles and charge smoothly and quickly. In terms of equipment, he also created the "double-barreled wooden handle flare," "rice bag blasting," and "homemade anti-tank incendiary bottle."
　　Since he began researching blasting technology in 1943, he began to take on the educational work of blasting technology. At that time, in the fifth sub-district of Bohai, landmine technology was used to train militiamen, armed work teams, and independent battalions, so that blasting was mastered by the masses, launching a mass blasting movement and consolidating the anti-Japanese base areas. He successively opened fifteen short-term blasting training courses, training more than 500 demolitionists for the troops. After the troops marched into the Northeast, he opened cadre training classes and research classes for platoons, companies, and battalions, summarizing and widely disseminating blasting experience and technological innovations. In 1948, he was transferred to the engineering school, where he educated three brigades, about 2,500 people, in five months.
　　Under the Party's nurturing and education, Comrade Huo Lantian has regarded engineering as his lifelong career, and he has unswervingly focused his thinking on his work. After he was wounded in the right arm while attacking the Xingjiayutou stronghold, making it almost impossible for him to carry explosives and perform blasting tasks, he did not diminish his confidence in the engineering cause. He said, "Although my hand is weak, my brain can still think, and I can still create some engineering technology things to replace my hand to kill the enemy." Supported by this idea, he constantly researched and constantly created. Now he feels that his cultural level is low and it is slow to absorb knowledge from books, which restricts his political and technical improvement. Therefore, he is tirelessly working hard at cultural learning. (Attached picture)

　　爆破英雄霍蓝田
    他是一个智勇双全的爆破手，也是一个工兵技术的创造者。在党的培养教育下，他把工兵事业作为自己的终身事业。
    爆破英雄霍蓝田同志，是四野工兵部队中杰出的英雄人物。山东省博兴县人，今年四十二岁，一九三九年六月入伍，历任班、排长、参谋、爆破教员等职，现任中南军区工兵学校队长。
    抗战末期和解放战争初期，我们要以低劣的装备进行攻坚战，夺取日寇据点，消灭美械装备的蒋匪军和攻取城市，爆破代替了重炮。霍蓝田就是一个智勇双全的爆破手，勇敢的活跃在战斗的最前线；同时也是一个工兵技术创造者，给予部队攻坚时很大的方便，且减少了许多不必要的伤亡。
    一九四三年夏天，山东渤海区攻打日伪军的主要据点祁犁巴战战斗时，敌人有三个中队，工事很坚固，我们两个爆破组去执行任务，霍蓝田为二组组长。当一组扛着炸药冲向碉堡时，不幸炸药被敌人击中，全组光荣牺牲。垂死的敌人察觉了我们主攻的方向，疯狂的向外开火，在外壕周围燃起了一片片的火光。霍蓝田组的两个爆破员又相继牺牲，只剩下他一个人了。霍蓝田向指挥战斗的王营长提出：“选择敌人火力薄弱的地方，进行爆破。”营长同意了，在两个特等投弹手的掩护下，他光着身子，打着赤脚，滚上一身黄泥，抱着炸药就往预定的目标跑去。炸药爆炸了，轰开了一个突破口，使部队胜利的完成全歼守敌的任务。仅这一年内，他总计爆破了敌人十一个坚固的堡垒，在山东渤海军区英模大会上，荣获了“爆破英雄”的称号。
    在历次的攻坚战中，他凭着自己的作战经验，对爆破技术有许多创造。比如：有时爆破的结果，同志们总感到突破太小，洞太低，冲锋不方便，他就摹仿老百姓打场用的扬叉，制造了“高叉子”送炸药的办法，扩大了爆破口。我军攻打王家集，一个爆破员通过外壕送炸药未完成任务，反把自己掉在外壕里。他苦思研究后，又创造了“活叉子”送炸药的办法，使爆破手不要越过外壕，就能爆破敌人的围墙。其他如“接杆”等送药的工具，都使工兵在爆破中减少了伤亡，缩短了完成任务的时间，增强了爆破的效果。一九四四年，张许、王马等战役中，当我军大量使用冲锋桥渡过壕沟接近敌人时，敌人就在壕的内缘堆起一道高高的大岗，使我们过壕部队易被打落在壕沟里。为克服这个困难，他又发明了“冲锋梯”，用桥推梯子，梯子带桥连续动作的办法，越过壕沟，爬上土墙。另外，他还创造了“翻身子”，以及带有掩体的“坑道桥”，使突击部队能够克服敌人障碍，顺利而迅速的冲锋。在器材方面，他还创造了“双管木柄拉火把”，“米袋爆破”，和“土制反坦克燃烧瓶”。
    自一九四三年他开始研究爆破技术起，就开始担任爆破技术的教育工作。当时在渤海五分区，以地雷技术训练民兵、武装工作队和独立营，使爆破为广大群众所掌握，展开了群众性的爆破运动，巩固了抗日根据地。他先后开办了十五期短期爆破训练班，为部队培养了五百多名爆破手。部队进军东北后，他又开办班排连营的干部训练班和研究班，总结和广泛的传播爆破经验与技术上的创造。一九四八年，他被调到工校，在五个月中，教育了三个大队，约二千五百人。
    霍蓝田同志在党的培养教育下，把工兵事业作为他自己的终身事业，他始终不渝的把自己的思想集中在工作上。当他在攻打邢家予头据点右臂负伤后，几乎不能再扛炸药担负爆破任务了，但他并没减低对工兵事业的信心，他说：“我的手虽然没劲了，但我脑子还可以想，还可以创造一些工兵技术的东西，代替自己的手去杀敌。”就在这种思想的支持下，他不断的研究，不断的创造。现在他感到自己的文化水平低，吸收书本知识慢，在政治和技术的提高上受到限制，因此，他又在孜孜不倦的努力于文化学习了。（附图片）
