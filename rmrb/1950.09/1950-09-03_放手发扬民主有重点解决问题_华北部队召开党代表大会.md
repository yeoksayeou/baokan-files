　　Boldly Promote Democracy, Focus on Solving Problems
    North China Troops Hold Party Congress

    [Report from this newspaper] According to the decision of the North China Military Region, the North China troops will universally convene Party congresses and representative meetings at all levels this year. Through these meetings, democracy will be promoted, the enthusiasm of Party members will be brought into play, and the leadership of Party committees and branches at all levels will be strengthened to overcome various undesirable tendencies and implement the tasks of rectification and training, production, and bandit suppression. Under this guideline, for more than half a year, Party congresses have been convened in the following units: directly subordinate teams of the Military Region Headquarters, all departments of the Logistics Department, all directly subordinate divisions and some units of a certain army corps, and all sub-districts of the Hebei, Pingyuan, and Chahar Military Regions. Some units have also convened Party representative meetings.

    Due to the troops being in a war environment for a long time, the Party congresses and representative meetings could not be convened on schedule, and the democratic life within the Party was not normal enough. After the transition to rectification and training, a sense of pride and complacency became relatively widespread. Some cadres could not withstand the test of a victorious environment and developed decadent, degenerate, hedonistic, and corrupt ideas, and violations of discipline and law continued to occur. Bureaucratic work styles, such as superficial leadership, with only arrangements and no inspections, and being busy with administrative affairs, were also quite common. Some cadres also exhibited extremely serious warlordist work styles. The existence of these non-proletarian ideologies and work styles caused the leadership to become detached from the masses, damaging military-government, military-civilian, and military-internal relations, and becoming an obstacle to the advancement of the troops. The key to solving these problems lies in strengthening Party leadership, rectifying the ideological work style of cadres, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, improving the normal democratic life within the Party, and implementing the CCP Central Committee's resolution on convening Party congresses and representative meetings. Party organizations at all levels generally attached importance to this work, and the Party congresses and representative meetings of various units generally achieved results: the leadership of the Party committees was examined, various undesirable tendencies were criticized, the ideological work style of cadres underwent some changes, the principle atmosphere improved, organizational discipline was strengthened, and the troops were more united and consolidated than in the past. The following experiences were also gained:

    (1) First, it is necessary to clarify the direction, purpose, and tasks of the congress, and concentrate efforts on solving the main problems. At the meetings of various units, the leadership of the Party committees and past work were generally examined, and key problems that needed to be solved were proposed based on the specific situation of the unit. For example, the logistics department focused on launching a movement to protect and cherish national property, correcting the undesirable tendency of irresponsibility towards state property. The health department proposed strengthening the unity of new and old cadres and improving professional skills. Local military regions, such as Hebei, studied how to implement the current central tasks of production and eliminating the remaining bandits and special agents. Combat troops focused on solving the problems of officer-soldier relations, military-political cadre relations, and military-civilian relations. This allowed the congress to focus on solving problems without becoming a mere formality. To achieve this, it is necessary to do sufficient ideological and organizational preparatory work before the meeting: the Party committee itself must reach a consensus on the problems to be solved at the congress, prepare a work report, formulate opinions on future work guidelines, and embody the spirit of self-criticism in the report. Before the congress, it is also necessary to conduct democratic education for a certain period of time, study relevant documents, and make Party members and representatives understand the significance of the congress and their responsibilities. This is especially important for units that usually lack a democratic work style within the Party. Some units placed too much emphasis on formalistic preparations, or were not good at combining the preparations of the leadership with the preparations from below, or were not good at grasping the key points based on the actual situation and preparing work reports and resolutions, which made it impossible to properly solve problems and achieve satisfactory results.

    (2) The leadership's repeated expression of determination to accept criticism and deep self-examination is the key to promoting democracy. At the beginning of the Party Congress of the Transportation Department, some representatives still had concerns about carrying out democracy, such as "fear of retaliation," "not being effective," and "getting a bad impression." Only after the leading comrades of the Party committee sincerely expressed their determination to carry out democracy were the ideological obstacles cleared and the principle spirit of the congress strengthened. The responsible comrades of some district Party committees in Hebei were insufficiently democratic in their work style. After the exposure and self-criticism at the congress, they were finally able to distinguish right from wrong, unify their understanding, and maintain a happy unity between superiors and subordinates. After a deep self-examination by the leadership, the congress was able to smoothly launch the ideological struggle against various undesirable tendencies.

    The congress generally absorbed representatives of the masses to attend as non-voting delegates. Many units were able to encourage them to speak their minds and criticize the shortcomings of the leadership and Party member cadres. This not only made the masses lean towards the Party, but also transformed the Party's resolutions into the masses' own things through the masses' personal experience. The Party Congress of the Aviation Department commended the exemplary actions of the masses, and Party members examined their closed-doorism mentality, which greatly moved the representatives of the masses. They also examined their own shortcomings and actively provided suggestions to the congress.

    Judging from the general situation of the congress, persisting in promoting democracy is a arduous ideological struggle process. Some leading cadres do not fully understand this. Although they want to promote democracy at the beginning, they often waver as soon as opinions from below emerge. They are afraid to let go boldly, afraid of getting themselves wet, and afraid that it will be difficult to end the situation. Comrades from higher-level leading organs attending the congress must firmly grasp the principles, help them clear their minds, and, through ideological struggle and the actual education of the congress, make them truly realize the benefits of promoting democracy so that they can consciously and boldly carry out criticism and self-criticism.

    (3) Holding a successful Party congress is only the beginning of improving work. To implement the resolutions of the Party congress, it is necessary to improve the collective leadership of the Party committee and branch, carry out democratic movements from top to bottom, establish a normal democratic life inside and outside the Party, and convene work meetings of various departments step by step to examine and improve work styles. After a certain period, the Party representative meetings of various units should be convened again to examine and summarize the work since the Party congress and to solve the more important problems that still exist.

    In units where the Party congress was successfully held, the leadership of the Party committee and branch was improved and strengthened. The Party committee became more united internally, and the bureaucratic, administrative, warlordist, and undemocratic work styles of leading cadres were exposed and criticized. The ideological awareness of Party members has also been improved, and liberalism, lack of organization, lack of discipline, and anarchism have been basically overcome. The relationship between superiors and subordinates, military-government relations, officer-soldier relations, and Party-masses relations in the troops have been fundamentally improved, the confidence of cadres in their work has been enhanced, and the troops have been consolidated. However, some units still do not fully recognize the importance of this work and must implement it in the rectification movement.

　　放手发扬民主有重点解决问题
    华北部队召开党代表大会
    【本报讯】根据华北军区决定，今年华北部队普遍召开党的各级代表大会和代表会议。通过这些会议发扬民主，发扬党员的积极性，健全各级党委和支部的领导，以克服各种不良倾向，贯彻执行整训、生产、剿匪任务。在这一方针下，半年多以来，已召开党代表大会的计有：军区司政直属队，后勤各部，各直属师及某兵团一些单位，河北、平原、察哈尔军区的各分区。有的单位并召开了党的代表会议。
    由于部队长期处于战争环境，党代表大会和代表会议不能按期召开，党内民主生活不够正常。转入整训以后，比较普遍地滋生了骄傲居功情绪，部分干部经不起胜利环境的考验，滋长了颓废堕落、享乐腐化思想，违法犯纪之事不断发生；领导工作不深入，有布置无检查，辛辛苦苦，忙于事务的官僚主义作风也相当普遍；某些干部还存在极为严重的军阀主义作风。这些非无产阶级思想作风的存在，使领导与群众脱节，军政、军民、军内各种关系受到损害，成为部队前进中的障碍。解决这些问题的关键，在于加强党的领导，整顿干部的思想作风，开展批评和自我批评，健全党内的正常民主生活，贯彻中共中央关于召开党的代表大会和代表会议的决议。各级党组织一般均重视了这一工作，各单位党的代表大会和代表会议一般都开得有成绩：检查了党委的领导，批判了各种不良倾向，干部的思想作风有所转变，原则空气提高，组织性纪律性加强，部队较之过去更加团结巩固。并获得如下经验：
    （一）首先必须明确大会的方针、目的与任务，集中力量解决主要问题。各单位的会议上，一般均检查了党委的领导与过去的工作，并根据本单位具体情况，提出须待解决的重点问题。如后勤部门着重开展保全与爱护祖国财产运动，纠正对国家财产不负责任的不良倾向；卫生部提出加强新老干部团结和提高业务技术；地方军区如河北则研究如何贯彻当前生产与肃清残余的土匪特务等中心任务；战斗部队则着重解决官兵关系、军政干部关系、军民关系问题等。这样就使大会能有重点的解决问题而不流于形式。要做到这一点，须在会前做充分的思想上与组织上的准备工作：党委本身对大会要解决的问题在认识上取得一致，做好工作报告，制订关于今后工作方针的意见，并在报告中贯彻自我批评精神。大会以前还须以一定时间进行民主教育，学习有关文件，使党员及代表明了大会意义及自己职责，这对于平素党内缺乏民主作风的单位，尤为重要。有些单位准备工作偏重形式，或不善于把领导的准备与下面的准备结合进行，或不善于针对实际情况，抓住要害，做好工作报告和决议，就不能恰当地解决问题，收效就差。
    （二）领导上反复表示接受批评的决心，并深刻地自我检讨，是发扬民主的关键。运输部党代表大会开始时，部分代表对开展民主仍存在“怕报复”、“不顶事”、“落个坏印象”等顾虑，经党委负责同志诚恳表示开展民主的决心，才扫除了思想障碍，加强了大会的原则精神。河北某些分区党委负责同志民主作风不足，经过大会的揭发与自我批评，最后是非分明，统一了认识，上下团结愉快，在领导上进行了深刻的检讨之后，大会就能顺利地展开反对各种不良倾向的思想斗争。
    大会一般均吸收了群众代表列席，不少单位能启发他们说真心话，批评领导上和党员干部的缺点。这样不仅使群众向党靠拢，并且使党的决议通过群众的切身体验，变成群众自己的东西。航空处党代表大会表扬了群众的模范行动，党员检讨了关门主义思想，使群众代表受很大感动，他们也检讨了自己的缺点，并向大会积极提供建议。
    从大会的一般情况看，坚持发扬民主乃是一个艰巨的思想斗争过程。有些领导干部对此认识不足，开始时虽想发扬民主，但下面意见一露头，往往就动摇了，不敢大胆放手，怕自己下水，怕难以收场。上级领导机关出席大会的同志，须紧紧掌握原则，帮助他们打通思想，经过思想斗争和大会的实际教育，使他们真正地体会到发扬民主的好处，才能达到自觉，放手展开批评和自我批评。
    （三）开好党代表大会，只是改进工作的开端。要将党代表大会决议贯彻执行，必须健全党委和支部的集体领导、自上而下地开展民主运动，建立党内外正常的民主生活、有步骤地召开各个部门的工作会议，检查工作，改进工作作风。经过一定时期，再召开各单位的党代表会议，检查与总结党代表大会以来的工作，解决当前尚存在的比较重大的问题。
    党代表大会开得好的单位，党委和支部的领导改进和加强了。党委内部更加团结了，领导干部的官僚主义、事务主义、军阀主义、不民主等作风得到了揭露和批判；党员觉悟水平也有所提高，自由主义、无组织、无纪律、无政府状态基本克服；部队上下级关系、军政关系、官兵关系、党群关系，有了基本改善，干部工作信心提高，部队巩固。但有些单位对这一工作的重要性尚认识不足，须在整风运动中加以贯彻执行。
