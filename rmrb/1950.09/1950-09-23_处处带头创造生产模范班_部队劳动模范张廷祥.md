Comrade Zhang Tingxiang is the squad leader of the Second Company of the Training Battalion of a certain unit in the Suiyuan Military Region. He was selected to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers.

He is from Dengjia Village, Youyu County, Chahar Province. Since he was a child, he worked in the fields and carried coal for landlords, suffering exploitation and abuse. When he was seventeen, the Japanese devils surrendered, and the people's government was established in his village. He became a militiaman. Later, the masses elected him as the village head. In January 1946, he voluntarily joined the guerrilla team and became an armed soldier of the people.

He never stopped production in the army. When he was transferred from the guerrilla team to the supply department of the Fifth Military Sub-district of Suiyuan as a messenger, he and seven comrades were responsible for planting eleven mu of vegetable fields. He took the lead in plowing, digging waterways, and carrying manure. He also used a crane to draw water for irrigation and sacrificed his nap time to weed and cultivate the seedlings. As a result, the vegetables grew very well. In addition to supplying 120 people, more than 4,000 catties were left over. During the summary, he was rated as a first-class labor model.

In February 1947, he was transferred to the guard company of the sub-district as a soldier. At that time, the company had to go more than 20 li to carry coal, passing through two large mountains, which was quite difficult. However, Comrade Tingxiang always carried 160 to 170 catties each time. Under his influence, the task of carrying coal was successfully completed, and he received three verbal commendations.

There are many similar things. For example, in June 1947, when he was in the Fifth Sub-district Training Team, he had to carry grain 120 li away. He carried more than 120 catties each time (a total of six or seven times). Later, he was merged into the Suimeng Military Region Training Team. The team's coal burning was all done by the troops themselves, from digging to carrying. He volunteered to go down to the kiln to dig coal and also carried it himself. There was a large ditch between the coal kiln and the駐地, and the slope was very steep. However, Comrade Tingxiang always carried 160 to 170 catties of coal each time, and at most he carried 220 catties (about 40 times). He walked very fast, often carrying the coal back himself, and then turning back to help other comrades carry it.

In April 1948, he was transferred to work in the replenishment training regiment. Once, the troops marched from Shijiazhuang to Hejin, Shanxi. During the march, Comrade Tingxiang not only carried the supplies for the whole squad, but also took care of the new soldiers enthusiastically, carrying six or seven backpacks for one person, walking more than 80 li every day. He was so tired that he fainted, but when he woke up, he still insisted on marching.

Comrade Zhang Tingxiang is now the squad leader of the training team. However, four of the nine people in the squad are company-level cadres. He felt that it was inconvenient to lead them now that he was usually under their leadership. But he also thought that since the superiors had given him the task, he should take it on. He always led everyone with his own exemplary actions. Before the spring plowing this year, he took the lead in accumulating fertilizer, getting up early and going to bed late every day, and using his rest time to pick up manure. Until the land reclamation, his squad picked up more than 6,000 catties of manure, and he himself picked up more than 5,400 catties. When spring plowing began, he repeatedly explained the importance of production to his comrades, and at the same time actively took the lead in plowing. He plowed the difficult land, and after he finished plowing, he helped others plow. When everyone was tired from the fields and lay on the kang without moving, he brought them water to wash their faces, brought them food, and swept the floor. Finally, he motivated everyone to become active as well. He also launched the whole squad to challenge other squads, setting off a production upsurge in the whole team. In production, he personally created a record of reclaiming 1.3 mu of land per day. The whole squad reclaimed more than 80 mu of land in more than 20 days. After each land reclamation, he also mobilized everyone in the squad to carry back a bundle of dry firewood for the kitchen, and he carried the most. After returning, he also used his rest time to carry water for the kitchen. During the production period, his squad enthusiastically carried out "soldier-acting-soldier" recreational activities, performing an average of one program per week. During the production summary, he won the title of Model Class. The troupe of the division created a play called "The Production Upsurge of Zhang Tingxiang's Squad," which was performed in the whole division and played a certain role in promoting production work.

He combined production and learning very well. In production, he brought literacy textbooks and used his rest time to recognize characters, writing on the ground with wooden sticks. He recognized more than 400 characters and can now read the army's tabloids.

When asked why he was able to work so hard and overcome difficulties, he said: "This is the power of the Party. When I encountered difficulties, I quickly remembered what the instructor said when I joined the Party: 'Party members should not be afraid of difficulties, and the personal interests of Party members must resolutely obey the interests of the organization…'"

The twenty-two-year-old Comrade Zhang Tingxiang is such an outstanding figure.

　　处处带头创造生产模范班
    部队劳动模范张廷祥
    张廷祥同志，是绥远军区某部教导大队二中队的班长，这次他被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表。
    他是察哈尔省右玉县邓家村人，从小就给地主种田、背炭，受尽了剥削和打骂。十七岁那年，日本鬼子投降了，他村建立起人民的政权，他便当了民兵。后来群众又选举他当村长。一九四六年一月，他自动参加了游击队，便成为一个人民的武装战士了。
    他在军队里时刻也没停止过生产。由游击队调到绥远五军分区供给处当通信员时，他和七个同志负责种十一亩菜地，他带头刨地、挖水道、担粪，又用吊杆打水浇菜，并牺牲午睡拔草锄苗。结果菜长得很好，除供给一百二十人吃用外，还剩余四千多斤。总结时，他被评为甲等劳动模范。
    一九四七年二月调到分区警卫连当战士，那时连里烧炭要到二十多里地以外去背，途经两座大山，相当困难，但是廷祥同志每次总是背一百六、七十斤。在他的影响下，顺利完成了背炭任务，曾得到三次口头表扬。
    类似这样的事情还有很多。如一九四七年六月间，在五分区教导队时，要到一百二十里远的地方去背粮，他每次都背一百二十余斤（共计六、七次）。后合并到绥蒙军区教导队，队上烧炭全由部队自刨自背。他自报奋勇下窑刨炭，并且自己也跟着背。炭窑与驻地之间有道大沟，坡度很陡，但廷祥同志每次背炭总是一百六、七十斤，最多曾背到二百二十斤（共背四十次左右）。走得又快，常常自己背回来以后，再回头去帮助别的同志背。
    一九四八年四月，他调到补训团工作。有一次部队从石家庄开到山西河津，行军途中，廷祥同志除背全班给养外，并热情照顾新战士，一个人背六、七个背包，每天走八十余里，曾累得晕了过去，但醒过来仍然坚持着行军。
    张廷祥同志现在是教导队的班长，可是一班九个人就有四个是连级干部，他认为平常自己在人家领导下，现在领导他们真有许多不便。但他又想上级既然交给了任务，就应当担负起来。他处处用自己的模范行动来领导大家。今年春耕开始前，他即带头积肥，每天早起晚睡，利用休息时间去拾粪。直到开荒为止，他班共拾粪六千多斤，他自己就拾到五千四百多斤。春耕开始，他又反复地向同志们解释生产的重要性，同时自己在刨地中积极带头，难开的地他开，他先开完了，就帮助别人开。从地里回来，大家疲劳了都躺在炕上不动，他给大家打洗脸水，打饭扫地。终于带动大家也积极起来了。他又发动了全班向其他班挑战，掀起全队的生产热潮。在生产中，他个人创造了每天开荒一亩三分地的纪录，全班开荒二十多天，共开地八十余亩。每次开荒完了，他还发动全班每人给伙房背回干柴一捆，而他背的最多，回来后还利用休息时间给伙房担水。在生产期间，他班热烈地开展了“兵演兵”的文娱活动，平均每周演出一个节目，在生产总结时，获得了模范班的称号。并由师文工团编出“张廷祥班的生产热潮”一剧，在全师公演，对生产工作起了一定的推动作用。
    他把生产与学习结合得挺好。在生产中，带上识字课本，利用休息时间认字，用木棍在地上写，共识字四百多，现在已经可以看部队的小报了。
    问他为什么能这样辛勤劳动，克服困难呢？他说：“这是党的力量，当我遇见困难时，就很快地想起了入党时指导员说的话：‘党员要不怕困难，党员的个人利益要坚决服从组织利益……。’”
    二十二岁的张廷祥同志，就是这样出色的人物。
