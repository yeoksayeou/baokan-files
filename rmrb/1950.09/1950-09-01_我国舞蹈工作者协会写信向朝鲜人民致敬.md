The China Dance Workers Association Sends Letter of Respect to the Korean People

[Our Newspaper News] Dai Ailian, Chairman of the All-China Dance Workers Association, and Wu Xiaobang, Vice Chairman, wrote a letter on behalf of dance workers across the country to the Korean people who are fighting heroically, extending their respects to them. The full letter is as follows:

Dear Korean Brothers and Sisters:

Like peace-loving people all over the world, we, the Chinese people, are daily rejoicing at the heroic achievements of the heroic Korean People's Army, which is rapidly moving towards complete victory.

The imperialists' aggression against Korea is part of the Wall Street cannibals' mad aim to dominate the world. As the Korean people are victoriously completing national liberation and unification, we are also determined to liberate Taiwan.

We have full confidence in the power of united and unwavering people, and in the victory of the brave Korean people.

Long live the victory of the Korean people!
