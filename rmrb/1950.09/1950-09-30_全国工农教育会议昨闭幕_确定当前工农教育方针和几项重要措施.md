　　Xinhua News Agency, September 29th—The first National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education, lasting ten days, concluded on September 29th. After in-depth and detailed discussions, the conference achieved three main gains: First, the conference clearly stipulated that carrying out workers' and peasants' education is an important weapon for consolidating and developing the people's democratic dictatorship. The current guidelines for workers' and peasants' education should be based on the current overall national situation and tasks, with cultural education (primarily literacy education) as the main content, appropriately combined with political education, production technology education, and hygiene education. It should first focus on the education of workers' and peasants' cadres and activists, and gradually extend this education to all workers and peasants who urgently need to learn, especially organized young men and women. Second, based on the above guidelines, several important measures were determined, and the following six draft documents were approved: Instructions on Running Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools and Workers' and Peasants' Cultural Supplementary Schools, Instructions on Carrying Out Farmers' Spare-Time Education, Provisional Implementation Measures for Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle Schools, Provisional Implementation Measures for Workers' and Peasants' Cultural Supplementary Schools, Provisional Implementation Measures for Employee Spare-Time Education, and Organizational Regulations for Employee Spare-Time Education Committees at All Levels. These drafts will be submitted to the Government Administration Council, the Central Ministry of Education, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions for review, approval, and promulgation. Third, the conference exchanged valuable experiences related to workers' and peasants' education from various regions and departments.
    This conference received instructions from Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Vice Chairman Li Jishen, and received assistance from educational departments at all levels of government, cultural and educational departments of trade unions at all levels, labor departments, industrial management departments, and people's organizations, resulting in a successful outcome.
    The conference concluded with a closing speech by Ma Xulun, Minister of the Central Ministry of Education. He pointed out the gains of this conference, called on everyone to overcome difficulties and work hard, and expressed hope that when the Second National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education is convened, workers' and peasants' education will have greater development and higher achievements, and that more model teachers and model students will emerge, and better methods and experiences will be created.

    确定当前工农教育方针和几项重要措施
    【新华社二十九日讯】第一次全国工农教育会议历时十天，已于二十九日闭幕。会议经过深入和详尽地讨论后，取得了三个主要收获：第一、会议明确地规定了开展工农教育就是巩固和发展人民民主专政的重要武器。当前工农教育的方针要根据当前国家的总情况和总任务，以文化教育（首先是识字教育）为主要内容，并适当地结合政治教育、生产技术教育和卫生教育；首先着重对工农干部和积极分子的教育，并逐步地推广这种教育到一切迫切要求学习的工农群众中去，首先是有组织的男女青年中去。第二、根据以上方针，确定了几个重要的措施，通过了关于举办工农速成中学和工农文化补习学校的指示、关于开展农民业余教育的指示、工农速成中学暂行实施办法、工农文化补习学校暂行实施办法、职工业余教育暂行实施办法，以及各级职工业余教育委员会组织条例等六个草案。这些草案都作为建议，提请政务院、中央教育部、全国总工会审查批准后颁布施行。第三、会议交流了各地各部门有关工农教育的宝贵经验。
    此次会议获得了毛主席、朱总司令、刘少奇副主席、李济深副主席等的指示，并得到了各级政府教育部门、各级工会文教部门、劳动部门、各产业管理部门、各人民团体等的协助，使得会议结果圆满。
    会议最后由中央教育部马叙伦部长致闭幕词。他指出此次大会的收获，号召大家克服困难，努力工作，并希望在召开第二次全国工农教育会议的时候，工农教育有更大的发展，更高的成就，涌现出更多的模范教师和模范学员，并创造出更好的办法和经验来。
