Qian Anliang, Skilled in Close Combat
    In battle, he is brave and tenacious, skilled in close combat, and throws a mean hand grenade.

    Comrade Qian Anliang has been in the army since 1943, fighting from northern Jiangsu to Northeast China, and then from Northeast China to South China. He has been awarded eight major merits, the Mao Zedong Medal issued by the Fourth Field Army, and a commendation telegram from Commander Lin Biao. He has the glorious title of Iron Hero.

    In battle, he is brave and tenacious, charging fiercely. He is best at close combat and throws a mean hand grenade. During the Northeast Summer Offensive in 1947, he was the squad leader of the Ninth Squad and led his squad in the assault mission on the Siping Airport. As they crossed more than 30 meters of open ground, barbed wire blocked their path, and the enemy swept over with intensive fire. Ninth Squad combat team leader, Mou Xingwu, failed to cut the barbed wire with shears. Qian Anliang was anxious, leaped out, ran to the barbed wire, and with a forceful tug, pulled down the barbed wire. He immediately charged to the first bunker. The enemy was forced to flee along the communication trench. He quickly jumped into the communication trench, throwing hand grenades and chasing after them to the second bunker. An enemy soldier was facing him, firing a machine gun that was hot from use. Qian Anliang cleverly circled to the flank, launching a surprise attack, and pounced on the enemy, grabbing the machine gun. The skin on his right palm and wrist was scorched, but he ignored the pain and fiercely fought with the enemy, finally seizing the machine gun. Then, they took down three more bunkers and pounced on the red brick house. The enemy was compressed in the communication trench behind the house. He used superior grenade-throwing skills, inflicting great casualties on the enemy. Finally, in less than an hour, they annihilated the so-called "model company" of the bandit army's 88th Division, earning Commander Lin's telegram commendation.

    After the Siping siege, Qian Anliang was promoted to deputy platoon leader of the second platoon. In the autumn of 1947, during the battle of Faku, in a deep penetration battle, an enemy battalion relied on a building in the center of the city, using fire to frantically block the alleyways. Bullets kicked up dust on the road. The battalion commander ordered him to take the small building. He looked at the terrain, took the Fifth and Sixth Squads into a small courtyard, pushed down the wall, and slipped into a house facing the street, seeing the enemy only twenty meters away through the door seam. He deployed his troops on the roof and at each doorway. The first grenade he threw exploded in front of the enemy, and then the two squads threw hand grenades in unison, suppressing the enemy's firepower. He took the lead in seizing the opportunity to rush up, capturing five prisoners and seizing a light machine gun, occupying the small building. Then, he calmly and forcefully threw more than thirty hand grenades, repelling the enemy's several counterattacks.

    In the autumn of 1948, during the Jinzhou Campaign, the superiors ordered him to lead a platoon to carry out the assault mission north of Jinzhou—crossing the Xiaoling River and penetrating into the city. The Xiaoling River was about fifty meters wide, and there was a plain of three hundred meters from the north bank to the edge of the city, making the terrain quite unfavorable. But he was not deterred by the difficulties and immediately mobilized everyone to start preparations. On September 13, the general offensive began. After a fierce artillery barrage, Qian Anliang, accurately grasping the battle opportunity, quickly said to everyone: "Attack immediately, the formation should be dispersed, the movements should be fierce." As soon as he finished speaking, several more shells exploded on the city walls and bunkers. "Charge! Comrades, it's time to make meritorious contributions." His battle cry increased everyone's courage. At this time, enemy aircraft strafed at low altitude even more frantically. Shells caused waves in the Xiaoling River. The brave Qian Anliang did not think about these things, only caring about leading his sharp knife platoon, braving the enemy's artillery fire, quickly crossing the Xiaoling River, taking advantage of the dense artillery smoke, pouncing on them, opening the breakthrough, and developing into the depths of the city. When entering Nü'er Street, they encountered stubborn resistance from the enemy. He calmly directed machine-gun fire, covering the Ninth Squad's destruction of the enemy's core bunker, and continued to penetrate, until at two o'clock in the afternoon, they met up with brother troops at the enemy's final fatal location—Baiyun Park.

    The battle ended victoriously. This platoon captured more than three hundred enemies alone. Qian Anliang was awarded the Mao Zedong Medal issued by the Fourth Field Army. (Attached image)

　　善于近战的钱安良
    在战斗中他勇敢顽强，善于近战，又打得一手漂亮的手榴弹
    钱安良同志，自一九四三年入伍后，随军转战，由苏北到东北，又从东北到华南，已立下了八大功，荣获四野颁发的毛泽东奖章和林彪司令员传令嘉奖，有钢铁英雄的光荣称号。
    战斗中他勇敢顽强，猛打猛冲，最善近战，又打得一手漂亮的手榴弹。一九四七年东北夏季攻势中，他是九班班长，带领全班受命执行四平飞机场战斗的突击任务。当他们穿过三十多米的开阔地时，铁丝网挡住了进路，敌人以密集的火力扫过来，九班战斗组长牟兴武用剪子破铁丝网没成功。钱安良急了，一跃而出，跑到铁丝网跟前，用力一掣，把铁丝网拉倒了，随即冲到第一个碉堡跟前，敌人被迫沿着交通沟逃窜，他迅速跳到交通沟里，一面打手榴弹，一面追到第二个地堡跟前。迎面敌人正端着一挺打热的机枪在射击。钱安良机灵的绕到侧翼，出敌不意，猛扑上去抓住了机枪。他的右手掌和手腕的皮肤都给烫焦了，但他不顾疼痛和敌人猛烈搏斗，终于把机枪夺下来。接着他们又打下了三个地堡，猛扑到红房跟前，敌人被压缩在房后的交通沟里，他用超越的投弹技术，给了敌人很大杀伤。终于在不到一点钟的功夫，歼灭了匪军八十八师的所谓“模范连”，获得了林司令员的传令嘉奖。
    四平攻坚战之后，钱安良升为二排副。一九四七年秋打法库，在纵深战斗中，敌人一个营凭着一座在城中心的楼房，用火力疯狂的封锁着巷口，子弹打得马路上直翻土花。营长当面命令他拿下小楼。他看了地形，带着五、六班走进一个小院，推倒墙头，钻进一座临街的房子，从门缝看到敌人离他们不过二十米。他把队伍分布在屋顶和各门口，投出的第一个手榴弹，炸在敌人跟前，紧接着两个班一举投出手榴弹，把敌人的火力压住了。他带头乘机冲上去，抓了五个俘虏，缴了一挺轻机枪，占领了小楼。接着又沉着的一股劲打了三十多个手榴弹，把敌人几次反冲锋都打垮了。
    一九四八年秋，锦州战役中，上级命令他率领一个排执行锦州北面的突击任务——越过小凌河，杀入城内。小凌河宽约五十米，从北岸到达城边还有长达三百米的一片平原，地形相当不利，但他并没有被困难吓住，立即动员大家，开始了准备工作。九月十三日总攻开始，在一阵猛烈的炮火过后，准确掌握战机的钱安良忙向大家说：“马上就出击，队形要疏散，动作要猛。”他的话刚完，又是几个炮弹炸在城墙和地堡上。“冲啊！同志们，立功的时候到了。”他的喊杀声增加了每个人的勇气。这时，进行低空扫射的敌机，更加疯狂。炮弹打得小凌河的水翻起浪花，英勇的钱安良没有想到这些，只顾带着他的尖刀排，冒着敌人的炮火，迅速的渡过了小凌河，乘着浓密的炮烟，扑上去，打开了突破口，向市内纵深发展，当进到女儿街时，遇到敌人的顽抗，他沉着的指挥机枪火力，掩护九班炸塌敌人的核心碉堡，又继续的插下去，一直到下午两点钟在敌人最后的致命地——白云公园，和兄弟部队会合了。
    战斗胜利结束了，这个排光俘敌就有三百多，钱安良荣获了四野发的毛泽东奖章。（附图片）
