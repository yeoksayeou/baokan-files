The recipient of the First-Class People's Hero Medal of East China, Liu Kuiji, is a renowned young hero battalion commander in the Third Field Army. In 1949, he attended the Second Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth as one of the Chinese youth representatives. His attendance was met with enthusiastic cheers from youth representatives from all over the world, because they saw in him the heroic spirit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the iron will of the struggling Chinese youth.

Liu Kuiji is only twenty-four years old this year. He was wounded nine times during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, leaving him with sixteen scars from head to toe. In courageous battles, he served the people with outstanding achievements despite having a disabled right arm, making him an outstanding combat hero.

Liu Kuiji is a man with the strong will characteristic of the working class: When he obtained the leadership and education of the Communist Party and realized how he and millions of working people could be liberated, he fought stubbornly to the end. Liu Kuiji enlisted in the army for only eighteen days before his right arm was disabled in combat, forcing him to be demobilized. However, a few months later, he returned to the front with five militiamen. Soon after, he was wounded twice more in combat. The first time, he was hit in the head by shrapnel, but he ran back to the front line from the hospital before his injury healed. Later, he was wounded below his right eye during the war, but he refused to leave the front line, saying, "As long as I'm alive, I'll fight the enemy to the end!" Because neither his new nor old wounds had healed, the superiors wanted him to be demobilized, but he ran back to the front line from the demobilization team. He said, "I want to make revolution, I can't leave the army!" So he returned to his company and fought even more bravely than before. Because of his steadfastness and loyalty, Liu Kuiji became a glorious Communist Party member in 1946.

In July 1947, Liu Kuiji participated in the Battle of Zhilanzhuang along the Jiaoji Railway in Shandong. As soon as he joined the battle, he was shot in the head and fell to the ground. At this time, the road was tightly blocked by enemy fire, making it impossible to destroy the bunker. While everyone was hesitating, Liu Kuiji, disregarding his pain, jumped up from the ground, picked up a machine gun to provide cover for a comrade, and the comrade stepped forward and destroyed the bunker in an instant. Liu Kuiji then charged towards the enemy with everyone else, reaching a house only a few meters away from the enemy, where their retreat was cut off. There were only five of them, and all five were wounded, while the enemy had hundreds. Liu Kuiji and the others bombarded the enemy with volleys of hand grenades. During lulls in the fighting, they bandaged each other's wounds and motivated each other: "Comrades, hold on! If the enemy gets close, take their lives! Ignore them if they're far away!" They finally held on for the whole night, and the next day they successfully joined up with the follow-up troops. When launching the general offensive against the enemy, Liu Kuiji was the first to charge forward. The enemy's machine guns fired frantically at him, putting five or six holes in his pants, but he still charged forward bravely, eventually climbing over the low wall and jumping into the courtyard held by the enemy. He burst into the main room alone. Just as he stepped over the threshold, the enemy inside the room shouted, and two machine guns and a submachine gun were pointed at his chest and head. Without hesitation, Liu Kuiji used all his strength to charge towards the enemy, taking the opportunity to seize the enemy's machine gun.

"Surrender your guns! Or we'll shoot you dead!" Liu Kuiji shouted, leaning against the wall and holding the machine gun.

The enemies in the room were completely intimidated by Liu Kuiji's power, and they obediently surrendered their guns. The enemies in the wing room were still shooting outside, so Liu Kuiji crawled along the base of the wall, grabbed the machine gun at the door, and the scorching barrel almost burned his hand. The machine gun fired once, and a bullet grazed his calf. He threw two hand grenades fiercely into the room, silencing the machine gun, and the enemy had no choice but to surrender. In this battle, Liu Kuiji killed and wounded more than twenty enemies and captured seventeen alive.

Soon, Liu Kuiji was selected as a combat hero by the division and the Jiaodong Military Region, and he was promoted from soldier to squad leader and platoon leader.

Liu Kuiji is a person with such a high degree of class feeling: utter hatred for the enemy and ardent love for comrades. He always enthusiastically helped and cared for his comrades. In one battle, it was pouring rain and the roads were very difficult to walk on. In addition to carrying his own two hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition and a machine gun barrel, Liu Kuiji also helped a weak comrade carry four hundred rounds of ammunition. When a new recruit rolled into the mud and couldn't get up, he carried his two hundred and fifty rounds of ammunition and a rifle on his own body. Under the inspiration of his great friendship, the whole squad closely followed the team and maintained a strong fighting capacity. At the same time, Liu Kuiji often helped new recruits dispel various ideological concerns and learn combat techniques, transforming them from fear to fearlessness.

In 1948, during the attack on Zhoucun, he led a company responsible for breaking through the wall. He was shot and fell to the ground as soon as he approached the breach. He woke up from unconsciousness and led the soldiers to climb the wall again. Halfway up the ladder, he was shot again and fell from the ladder. So he lay in the enemy's intense fire and organized everyone to attack. After the gate was blown up, he crawled in through the doorway, and was wounded for the third time inside the wall. His leg was broken and he couldn't stand up, so he lay there and directed the entire company to defeat the enemy's counterattack, and persisted in the enemy's nest for a whole day.

Why was Liu Kuiji so strong? Liu Kuiji answered this question in his "August 1st" statement this year:

"I used to be a poor boy, and I worked as a coolie at the age of thirteen. I was cruelly trampled underfoot by the Kuomintang reactionaries and never lived a human life. When I was eighteen, I found the Communist Party, and I stood up and became a real person. The Party often teaches me: Don't forget your roots! Whenever I am in difficulty, I think of this sentence, and I think of myself as a Communist Party member, and I become particularly brave and strong." This is the source of the endless strength of Liu Kuiji and countless heroes in the People's Liberation Army!

　　英勇顽强的刘奎基
    华东一级人民英雄奖章的获得者刘奎基，是第三野战军中著名的青年英雄营长。他曾于一九四九年作为中国青年代表之一出席世界民主青年联盟第二次代表大会。他的到会受到了来自世界各处的青年代表的热烈欢呼，因为从他身上，大家看到了中国人民解放军的英雄气概，看到了斗争中的中国青年的钢铁意志。
    刘奎基今年才二十四岁。他在抗日战争和解放战争中曾经负伤九次，从头到脚有十六处伤痕。在英勇的战斗中，他带着一条残废的右臂为人民立下了卓著的功勋，使他成为一个杰出的战斗英雄。
    刘奎基是具有工人阶级所特有的坚强意志的人：当他获得了共产党的领导和教育，认识了怎样才能使自己和千万劳动人民获得解放的时候，他就倔强地斗争到底。刘奎基参军只十八天就因在作战中负伤而使右臂残废了，不得已只好复员。几个月之后，他却带了五个民兵回到前方来了。不久，他又在作战中负伤两次，第一次被炮弹片打伤头部，他没有等伤好就从医院里跑回前线，在战争中右眼下面又负了伤，但他拒绝下火线，他说：“只要我还活着，就要跟敌人拚到底！”因为新伤旧伤都没长好，上级要他复员，他又从复员大队跑回前线。他说：“我要革命，我不能离开部队！”于是他就回到了自己的连队里，而且作战时比以前更勇敢了。因为他的坚定和忠诚，一九四六年时，刘奎基就成为一个光荣的共产党员。
    一九四七年七月，刘奎基参加了山东胶济路旁的芝兰庄战斗，刚投入战斗，头部就被打伤倒在地上。这时道路被敌人的火力严密封锁住了，无法炸毁地堡，大家正在犹豫时，刘奎基不顾伤痛从地上一跃而起，抱起一挺机枪给一个同志打掩护，一个同志上前，倾刻就把地堡炸毁了。刘奎基接着就和大家一起向敌人冲过去，冲到距敌人只有几米达的一个房子里，后路被截断了。他们只有五个人，但五个人都负伤了，而敌人却有几百个。刘奎基和大家一起用成排的手榴弹轰击敌人。有一些空隙时就给大家包扎伤口，一个挨一个的动员：“同志，坚决守住，敌人来近了就要他命，离的远了就不睬他！”他们终于坚守了一整夜，第二天与后续部队胜利的会合了。向敌人发起总攻击时，刘奎基又第一个冲了上去。敌人的机枪拚命的向他射击，在他裤子上穿了五、六个洞，他仍奋勇向前冲去，一直翻过了矮墙，跳进了敌人据守的院子，就一个人撞进正房里去了。他一只脚刚踏进门槛，屋里的敌人一声吆喝，两挺机枪和一枝冲锋枪正指着他的胸口和脑袋。刘奎基毫不犹豫的用尽全身力气，猛向敌人冲去，趁势夺下了敌人的机枪。
    “快缴枪！不缴打死你们！”刘奎基端着机枪，偎在墙边高喊。
    一屋子的敌人完全被刘奎基这种声威慑服了，他们乖乖的缴了枪。厢房里的敌人还在向外面打枪，刘奎基就沿着墙根爬过去，一把抓住了门口的机枪，滚烫的枪筒差点把他的手烙住了。机枪响了一声，子弹从他的腿肚擦过去。他狠狠的向屋里投了两枚手榴弹，就把那挺机枪打哑了，敌人只好被迫投降。这一仗，刘奎基打死打伤敌人二十多个，活捉敌人十七个。
    不久刘奎基就被选为师的和胶东军区的战斗英雄，并且由战士升到班长、排长。
    彻底的恨敌人，热烈的爱同志，刘奎基就是具有这种高度的阶级感情的人。他总是热烈的帮助和关心同志。在一次作战中，大雨滂沱，道路非常难走，刘奎基除了背着自己的二百五十发子弹和一个机枪筒外，又帮体力弱的同志背了四百发子弹。一个新战士滚到烂泥里爬不起来，他又把他的二百五十发子弹和一枝步枪背在自己身上。全班在他高度友爱的感召下，紧紧跟上队伍，保持了顽强的战斗力。同时，刘奎基常帮助新战士解除各种思想顾虑，学习战斗技术，使他们由恐惧到无畏。
    一九四八年打周村时，他带领一个连负责突破围墙，刚接近突破口就被打伤倒地。他从昏迷中醒过来，又领着战士向围墙上爬，爬到梯子中间，又被打伤从梯子上跌下来。于是他就躺在敌人炽烈的火网里，组织大家突击。爆破了大门后，他就从门洞里爬了进去，在围墙里又负了第三次伤，腿被打坏站不起来，他就躺在那里指挥全连打垮了敌人的反击，并且在敌人窝里坚持了一整天。
    刘奎基为什么这样坚强无比呢？刘奎基曾在今年的“八一”感言上答复了这个问题：
    “我过去是个穷小子，十三岁时就做苦力工人，被国民党反动派残酷的踏在脚底下，没有过过一天人样的生活。十八岁时我找到了共产党，我才站立起来，成为一个真正的人。党常常教育我：不要忘本！每当艰难困苦的时候，我就想起了这句话，想起了我是个共产党员，便格外勇敢坚强起来。”这便是刘奎基和人民解放军中无数英雄的无穷力量的来源！
