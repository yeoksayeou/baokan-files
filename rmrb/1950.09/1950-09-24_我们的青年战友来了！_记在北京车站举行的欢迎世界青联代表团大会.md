　　Our Young Comrades-in-Arms Have Arrived!
    On the Welcoming Rally for the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation Held at the Beijing Railway Station
    By Our Correspondent Tan Wenrui
    After many days of anticipation, our comrades-in-arms—the representatives of the world's young peace fighters, the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation, arrived in Beijing on the morning of September 23rd, on the eve of our National Day anniversary. They will celebrate our National Day with us. As Delegation Leader Boukella said, they are here to cheer for our victory! "October 1st will not only be a festival for the Chinese people and youth, but also for the people and youth of the whole world."
    At 9:05 AM, the special train from Tianjin slowly entered the station platform amidst music and cheers. As soon as Boukella and the representatives from thirty-two other countries stepped off the train, Young Pioneers and female students swarmed forward, vying to present them with flowers. Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, and Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Military Commission, were the first to shake hands with Boukella and the representatives, expressing the welcome of the youth of all China and the youth of the capital. Then the other welcomers, including representatives of our young labor heroes and combat heroes, were introduced to the distinguished guests. However, the sound of cheering drowned out the individual greetings.
    The two-week visit to various parts of Northeast China did not tire the representatives; every representative's face beamed with a cheerful smile. Although everyone's mood was different, the Soviet representatives, Semi Chastny and Irina, as well as the representatives of the People's Democratic countries, were full of joy. The Korean representative, Jeon Jong-hwan, and the Vietnamese representative, Vu Xuan Vinh, wearing military uniforms, as well as the representatives of other countries engaged in national liberation struggles, would never forget their homeland's struggle. The Algerian representative, Kraba, who had just emerged from an Algerian prison, and the representatives of other capitalist countries would remember their suffering compatriots. However, at this moment of arriving in New China, they all felt incomparable excitement and joy.
    As the representatives, their arms full of flowers, walked out of the station, the welcoming crowd of more than seven thousand young people erupted in thunderous cheers. The representatives stood on their chairs, waving the bouquets in their hands to thank the welcomers. Behind them, more than thirty national flags of various countries appeared even more vibrant under the sunlight. This colorful bond symbolized the close unity of the democratic youth of the world and the unparalleled strength of the peace camp.
    Under the banner of "Workers of All Countries, Unite!", Liao Chengzhi, on behalf of the youth of China and Beijing, expressed a warm welcome to the representatives and paid a high revolutionary tribute to the democratic youth of the world they represented. He thanked them for their heroic struggle and diligent work in playing a significant role in the cause of safeguarding world peace and for their continued encouragement to the Chinese youth to fight alongside them for world peace. When he, on behalf of the Chinese youth, paid tribute to the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League and the Soviet youth, who stood at the forefront of the world's democratic youth, to the Korean youth who bravely resisted the American aggressors and achieved brilliant victories, to the youth of the People's Democratic countries who worked hard to build their motherland and defend world peace, to the youth of all oppressed nations around the world who fought for national liberation, and to the youth of various capitalist countries who struggled against wars of aggression and for peace and democracy, these young peace fighters were met with enthusiastic cheers time and time again. As American imperialism was carrying out its frantic aggression in Asia, and as the movement to defend peace was flourishing around the world, the Chinese youth expressed heartfelt welcome and sincere respect to their comrades-in-arms in this common struggle with the greatest enthusiasm.
    The words of Comrades Semi Chastny and Boukella stirred every young heart. Yes, "Undoubtedly, the two major forces in the World Federation of Democratic Youth—the Soviet youth and the Chinese youth—will more resolutely dedicate all their strength to consolidating the cause of peace and the democratic camp." "As long as we are united, we will be able to build a happy and free new world, and the dawn of this new world has already emitted a beautiful light in China!"
    They will see that our Chinese people and youth are working actively for the peaceful construction of the motherland and have created great achievements, so that they can go back and tell the people of the world what a strong will we have to defend world peace!

　　我们的青年战友来了！
    记在北京车站举行的欢迎世界青联代表团大会
    本报记者  谭文瑞
    盼望了多天，我们的战友——全世界青年和平战士的代表，世界民主青年联盟代表团，在我们国庆一周年前夕，九月二十三日的早晨来到了北京。他们将与我们一起庆祝我们的国庆，正如团长布加拉说的，他们是来欢呼我们的胜利的！“十月一日将不仅是中国人民和青年的节日，而且是全世界人民和青年的节日”了。
    九点五分，从天津开来的专车，在乐声与欢呼声中缓缓开进车站月台。布加拉和其他三十二国的代表一下车，少年儿童队员和女学生们就簇拥上前，争着向他们献花。中华全国民主青年联合总会主席廖承志、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记冯文彬和军委总政副主任萧华三位首先和布加拉与各代表们握手，代表全中国的青年和首都的青年表示欢迎。跟着其他的欢迎者，其中包括我们的青年劳动英雄与战斗英雄的代表，被介绍与贵宾见面。但是欢呼的声音掩盖了个别互相问好的声音。
    在东北各地两周的访问并没有使代表们感觉疲劳，每一个代表的脸上都露着愉快的笑容。虽然各人的心情不一样，苏联代表赛米恰斯尼与依丽娜以及人民民主国家的代表们是满心的喜悦，穿着戎装的朝鲜代表全宗焕和越南代表武春荣以及其他正在进行民族解放斗争国家的代表们会时刻不忘他们祖国的战斗，刚走出阿尔及尔监狱的阿尔及利亚代表克拉巴以及其他各资本主义国家的代表会怀念着在受苦难的同胞，但是，他们在到达新中国的这一刻，莫不感到无比的兴奋与高兴。
    当怀中抱满鲜花的代表们走出车站，七千多青年的欢迎队伍发出震天的欢呼。代表们都在椅子上站起来挥动他们手中的花束向欢迎者致谢。他们背后三十多面各国的国旗，在阳光照耀下显得加倍的鲜艳。这一条彩色的纽带，象征着全世界民主青年的紧密团结，也象征着和平阵营力量的无比强大。
    廖承志在“全世界民主青年团结起来！”的横标语下，代表中国和北京的青年向代表们表示了热烈的欢迎，同时向他们所代表的全世界的民主青年致崇高的革命敬礼，感谢他们英勇战斗与勤劳工作对保卫世界和平事业所起的巨大作用，以及一直鼓舞着我们中国青年和他们一起为争取世界和平而战斗的决心。当他代表中国青年向站在全世界民主青年最前列的苏联列宁共产主义青年团和苏联青年们致敬，向英勇地反抗美国侵略者而且取得了辉煌胜利的朝鲜青年们致敬，向为建设祖国、保卫世界和平而努力的人民民主主义国家的青年们致敬，向为争取民族解放而战斗的全世界一切被压迫民族的青年们致敬，向为反对侵略战争争取和平民主而斗争的各资本主义国家的青年们致敬的时候，这些青年和平战士们一次又一次的受到狂热的欢呼。当美国帝国主义正在亚洲进行疯狂侵略的时候，在保卫和平运动在全世界蓬勃展开的时候，中国的青年以最大的热情对他们共同斗争中的战友表示衷心的欢迎与崇敬。
    赛米恰斯尼和布加拉两同志的话激动着每一颗青年的心。是的，“毫无疑问，世界民主青年联盟中的两大队伍——苏联青年与中国青年，将更坚决的把所有的力量都贡献给巩固和平与民主阵营的事业。”“只要我们团结一致，将能建立一个幸福自由的新世界，这个新世界的曙光已在中国发出美丽的光辉了！”
    他们将看见我们中国人民与青年为祖国的和平建设而积极工作和已创造了伟大的成就，让他们回去可以告诉全世界的人民，我们是有着何等坚强的保卫世界和平的意志！
