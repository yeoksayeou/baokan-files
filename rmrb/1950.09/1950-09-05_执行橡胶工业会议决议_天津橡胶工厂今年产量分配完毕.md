　　Implementing Resolutions of the Rubber Industry Conference
    Tianjin Rubber Factories Complete Production Allocation for This Year
    The Tianjin rubber industry has, in accordance with the production guidelines and plans for the rubber industry stipulated by the National Rubber Industry Conference, allocated the production for the final four months of this year among Tianjin's factories. In the allocation process, the principle of "considering both public and private interests, rewarding progress, taking historical factors into account, and considering the overall situation" decided by the National Rubber Industry Conference was generally implemented. During the assessment, the state-owned North China Machine Company Rubber Parts Factory, in order to take care of private factories, voluntarily reduced its original plan, transferring 400,000 A-inch V-belts to private factories for production. The planned output of V-belts for state-owned factories such as Zhenhua was approved by their respective higher authorities. After discussion among the industry, it was decided to allocate production according to their original plans. The Dafushou brand automobile inner tubes produced by the Dalu Factory have consistently been of good quality, so the production quota allocated to the factory for automobile inner tubes was twice as high as that of factories with similar equipment. To encourage specialization, the amount of products allocated to factories specializing in rickshaw inner tubes (Yongfeng), rickshaw outer tubes (Yuhua), and sneakers (Dazhonghua) was also higher than that allocated to factories that also produced other goods.
    Before the production allocation, the Rubber Industry Trade Association surveyed the production capacity, sales situation, and other aspects of each factory, and studied the allocation method. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce also convened relevant industries such as department stores, bicycles, and hardware, as well as the Municipal Department Store Company and Trust Company, to exchange views on product sales issues. Then, each factory adopted a self-reporting and public discussion approach, dividing into groups according to the type of finished product to carry out the allocation. When reporting production volume, most factories initially reported inflated figures, causing the total of self-reported figures for some products to far exceed the total to be allocated. This was only corrected after persuasion and explanation.
    While carrying out the production allocation, the industry also established a statistical inspection committee to understand the production and sales situation of each factory at any time and to ensure that product specifications met the standards.

　　执行橡胶工业会议决议
    天津橡胶工厂今年产量分配完毕
    【新华社天津四日电】天津市橡胶业已根据全国橡胶工业会议规定的橡胶工业的生产方针和计划，分配了天津各厂今年中最后四个月的产量。在分配过程中一般地执行了全国橡胶工业会议决定的“公私兼顾、奖励进步、照顾历史、照顾全面”的分配原则。在评议时，国营华北机器公司橡胶配件厂为了照顾私营工厂，自动减少原计划，将四十万Ａ英寸三角带让给私营厂生产。公营振华等厂因三角带的计划产量，已经各该厂上级批准，经同业决定按其原计划予以分配。大陆厂所产的大福寿牌汽车内胎，一贯质量较好，所以分配给该厂汽车内胎的生产数额就比同等设备的工厂多一倍。为鼓励专业化，评议中对专作力车内胎的永丰，专作力车外胎的钰华，专作球鞋的大中华等厂分配的产品数额也比兼营各种制品的工厂为多。
    在分配产量前，橡胶业同业公会曾调查了各厂的生产能力、产销情况等，并研究了分配办法。市工商局也召集了百货、自行车、五金等有关行业及市百货公司、信托公司等就产品的销路问题交换了意见。然后各厂采取自报公议的方式，按所产成品的种类分组进行分配。在报产量时，大部工厂开始都有多报现象，使某些制品的自报总数远超过了应分配的总数，后经说服，解释，才得到纠正。
    与进行分配生产的同时，该业并成立了统计检查委员会，以随时了解各厂的产销情况和保证产品规格合于标准。
