Cavalry Hero Tai Xide

    "Live on horseback, die on horseback, let the saber see blood, and perform meritorious service for the people!" - Tai Xide

    In December 1947, it was the height of winter, with heavy snow falling. The cavalry division of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army was ordered in September to annihilate the 271st Regiment of the enemy's 79th Army. This battle was fought at Dawa, north of Siping. At this time, Comrade Tai Xide was serving as a staff officer in the 3rd Regiment of the division. The regiment ordered him to command the 2nd Company in combat, with the mission of charging on horseback. Even if only one person and one horse remained, the task had to be completed.

    The enemy advanced from Siping towards Dawa. When they realized we were prepared, they were too frightened to move forward. However, we could not let them escape so easily. We immediately launched a charge. Comrade Tai Xide took the lead, and the cavalrymen waved their sabers and spurred their horses onward. A violent blizzard swept across the plain. The enemy opened fire in a panic, trying to stop our advance. About 150 meters from the enemy, Comrade Tai Xide shouted loudly: "Live on horseback, die on horseback, the time has come for the saber to see blood and perform meritorious service for the people!" Following his slogan, the cavalry comrades loosened their reins, struck their horses' backs, crouched down, and plunged into the enemy ranks. They slashed with their sabers, kicked with their feet, trampled with their horses, and rammed with their bodies. The enemy was thrown into chaos, some surrendered, and some fled.

    After a brief reorganization, the troops launched another charge.

    Three light machine guns were firing at us from the front. Tai Xide spurred his horse forward and, with a swift stroke of his saber, first killed the three gunners, silencing the enemy's firepower and allowing the troops to advance smoothly. When two heavy machine guns blocked our way, he charged forward again and eliminated the enemy. When two 60mm mortars shelled us, he rode forward again and slashed those two fellows. Thus, the path of the charge was broadly opened by the 2nd Company led by Comrade Tai Xide. The entire regiment's and division's cavalry swept across the field, and the enemy was completely annihilated.

    In this battle, he alone killed more than forty enemies, captured three light machine guns, two heavy machine guns, and two 60mm mortars. At the entire regiment's military personnel meeting, he was awarded a special merit and won the "Hero Medal" of the Northeast Democratic Allied Army. The regiment and division issued commendations, saying that he had greatly demonstrated the power of the cavalry's mounted charge.

    Comrade Tai Xide is a Mongolian, from Linjiang Ga'erzhou Village in Tailai County, Heilongjiang Province, the son of a poor farmer. As a child, he herded cattle and horses for landlords. He was good at riding, liked to fight, and stood up for the wronged, possessing the unique simplicity, loyalty, and courage of a Mongolian. He joined the army after August 15th, 1945, and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1946. His first battle was the liberation of Qiqihar. In this battle, he demonstrated an outstanding spirit of self-sacrifice. At that time, he was a riding instructor in the cavalry company of the original 2nd Sub-district 2nd Regiment. The company's mission was to break through the enemy's defense line in the southeast of Qiqihar, seize the enemy's escape route, Baligangzi, and then expand the battle results towards the urban area to cooperate with friendly forces in eliminating the defending enemy "Restoration Army."

    Comrade Tai Xide requested to undertake the task of the assault group from the company commander. The company commander granted his request and sent two soldiers with a machine gun to accompany him. On the way forward, he used the few Chinese sentences he had just learned, "Hand over your guns, don't resist, lenient treatment for prisoners!" to persuade more than a dozen enemies to surrender their weapons. When he approached Baligangzi and rolled into a brick kiln, he was discovered by the enemy. The enemy suppressed him with heavy firepower, and the lights on the enemy's vehicles shone directly in front of him, making it impossible for him to advance or retreat. At this time, he was left alone with an empty gun and four hand grenades. Should he advance, or should he retreat? He thought: the task was one he had requested, and his determination when he swore the oath to join the Party was: charge ahead, retreat behind. What reason did a Communist Party member have to retreat?! So he took off his cotton-padded coat soaked in sweat and crawled forward. In this way, holding an empty gun, he fought the enemy while shouting slogans until the end of the battle. He captured an enemy major general, three captains, and more than one hundred soldiers alive, and seized six vehicles, four artillery pieces, and eight light machine guns.

    Under the cultivation of the Party, Comrade Tai Xide has grown stronger and participated in more than 200 battles, including forty mounted charges, and participated in famous battles such as Qiqihar, Siping, Changchun and Shenyang. He is currently the Deputy Chief of Staff of a cavalry regiment of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, and is only twenty-three years old this year. What a young, what a brave hero!

　　骑兵英雄邰喜德

    “活在马上，死在马上，马刀见血，为人民立功！”—邰喜德
    一九四七年十二月，正是隆冬严寒大雪纷纷的时节。东北民主联军的骑兵师，在九月奉命歼灭敌人七十九军二七一团。这个战斗就在四平以北的大洼打响了。此时，邰喜德同志在该师三团当参谋。团命令他去二连指挥作战，任务是乘马冲锋。即令是剩下最后一个人、一匹马也要完成任务。
    敌人由四平向大洼前进。等知道我们早有准备时，便胆怯得不敢向前。但是，我们却不能放他白白逃走。于是立即发起冲锋，邰喜德同志一马当先，骑士们挥舞战刀，策马冲上。平地卷起一阵暴烈的风雪。敌人仓惶地开了火，妄图阻止我们前进。离敌人还有一百五十来公尺，邰喜德同志高声喊道：“活在马上，死在马上，马刀见血，为人民立功的时候到了！”随着他的口号，骑兵同志们松开缰绳，打着马背，伏下身子，纵马跃入敌阵。他们用刀砍，用脚踢，马踏、人撞。敌人乱成一团，有的投降，有的逃跑。
    部队略一整理，又发起了冲锋。
    前面有三挺轻机枪向我扫射。邰喜德打马冲了上去，手起刀落，首先砍杀了那三个射手，窒息了敌人的火力，使部队得以顺利进展。前面又有两挺重机枪阻挡我们，他又冲上去消灭了敌人。前面还有两门六○炮向我轰击，他又乘马向前，刀劈了这两个家伙。于是冲锋的道路为邰喜德同志率领的二连广阔地打开了。全团全师的马队，漫野席卷而来，敌人全部被歼。
    这次战斗仅他一个人就砍死敌人四十多个，缴获三挺轻机枪、两挺重机枪、两门六○炮。全团军人大会上，给他评了一个特等功，并荣获东北民主联军“英雄奖章”。团、师都传令嘉奖，说他大大发挥了骑兵乘马冲锋的神威。
    邰喜德同志蒙古人，家在黑龙江省泰来县临江嘎尔洲屯，一个贫苦农民的儿子。小时给地主放牛牧马，善骑，好斗，打不平，有着一个蒙古人特有的淳朴、忠诚、勇敢的性格。“八一五”以后参军，一九四六年加入了中国共产党。他参加第一次战斗是解放齐齐哈尔。在这次战斗中，他表现了突出的自我牺牲的精神。那时，他在原二分区二团骑兵连任骑术教员。该连的任务是突破齐市东南敌人的防线，攻占敌人逃路八里岗子，再向市区扩张战果，协同友军消灭守敌“光复军”。
    邰喜德同志向连长要求担任突击组的任务。连长允诺了他的请求，并派两个战士携一挺机枪跟他一起。在前进的途中，他用刚学会的几句汉话“缴枪不要命，优待俘虏！”争取了十几个敌人缴了枪。当他已接近八里岗子，用身子滚进到一座砖窑旁边的时候，被敌人发觉了。敌人以强大的火力压制他，敌人汽车上的灯也直射到他的跟前，使他进退不得。这时只剩他一个人、一支空枪、四颗手榴弹了。前进呢，还是后退？他想到：任务是自己请求的，入党宣誓时自己的决心是：冲锋在前，退却在后。共产党员有什么理由后退！？于是他脱下了被汗水浸透的棉袄，向前爬去。就这样，他手执空枪，一边喊着口号，一边与敌人进行搏斗，一直到战斗结束的时候，他活捉了敌人少将一名、队长三名、士兵一百多名、缴获汽车六辆、大炮四门，轻机枪八挺。
    邰喜德同志在党的培养下，坚强地成长起来，身经二百多次战斗，四十次乘马冲锋，参加过齐齐哈尔、四平、长沈等著名的战役。他现任内蒙军区骑兵某部的团副参谋长，今年才二十三岁。多么年青，多么勇敢的英雄！
