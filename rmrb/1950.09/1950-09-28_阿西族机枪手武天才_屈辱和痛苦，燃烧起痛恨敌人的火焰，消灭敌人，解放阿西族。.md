Axi Machine Gunner Wu Tiancai
    Humiliation and pain ignite flames of hatred for the enemy; eliminate the enemy and liberate the Axi people.
    In January 1928, the hero Wu Tiancai was born into a poor Axi family in Ayu’an Village, Xishan District, Mile County, Yunnan Province. The family of ten had two mu of land, and life was as poor as water.
    Wu Tiancai became a "cowherd" at the age of seven. Just as Wu Tiancai himself felt: at that time, people had a harder time than cows. People worked like cows, cows could eat their fill of grass, but people couldn't eat their fill of rice. The hero's childhood was spent drifting in the sea of hunger and poverty.
    In 1944, he had grown up. One day, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang ordered the Bao chief to tie up Wu Tiancai and send him to the bandit 22nd Division as a soldier.
    In the Chiang bandit 22nd Division, Wu Tiancai and six other Axi people were assigned to the same squad. Wu Tiancai said: being a soldier there was actually being a cow. The officers gave them nothing but insults, beatings, and mockery.
    Humiliation and pain cultivated a deeper hatred. In the early spring of 1947, Wu Tiancai fled back to Ayu'an. From then on, he embarked on the road of revolution. One day, a local Communist Party member, Yang Ziting, secretly told him: "The Axi people can only turn themselves over by trying to overthrow the Chiang Dynasty!"
    "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Wu Tiancai used Yang Ziting's words to gather more than twenty Axi youths who also harbored hatred in their hearts. They often followed Wu Tiancai's cattle to the mountains to hold meetings and figure out solutions. Soon, these twenty-odd broad-shouldered and round-waisted men all joined the township militia team of the Zhuyuan Town Public Office.
    One winter night in 1947, the clock had struck twelve. It was very cold, and the wind whistled through the trees on the mountainside like the whistles of guerrillas. The officers of the township militia team were curling up like shrimp, smoking opium. It was Wu Tiancai and his twenty-odd men's turn to patrol the night. They walked out of the town public office as usual, all the way to the ancient forest in the western district. They took away thirty-five rifles, two submachine guns, five pistols, and six thousand rounds of ammunition that they didn't have to pay for, especially Wu Tiancai, who also carried a light machine gun.
    After arriving in the mountains, Wu Tiancai asked everyone to rest and study on the mountain, and he disguised himself and ran down the mountain to spread propaganda to the various villages of the Axi people. Soon, another eighty-seven Axi youths joined, and Wu Tiancai formed a strong militia team in Xishan, Mile.
    The growth of the people's power was extremely unpleasant for the enemy.
    When the second year of spring arrived, Lu Guoxiang, the big local tyrant and security captain of Mile County, led a large team of soldiers to attack Wu Tiancai's militia team. Wu Tiancai led his militia team, using spears, homemade guns, and those weapons they brought without payment, in a fierce battle with the enemy for five hours on the rocky shore of Malu Village. The bandit army was routed, and the militia team chased all the way to Lu Guoxiang's house – Yanglin Village, capturing one submachine gun and one large horse.
    This victory attracted the attention of more enemies. A regiment of the Chiang bandit 26th Army came to Mile County to suppress the riot in Zhuyuan Town.
    Wu Tiancai's one hundred native-born militiamen scattered in the dense mountains and forests, fighting the enemy day and night.
    Once, Wu Tiancai, carrying his machine gun and accompanied by two militiamen, accidentally encountered the enemy on a hill. Dozens of enemies pounced on him. Wu Tiancai flashed and jumped into a ravine. Just when the enemy was confused, Wu Tiancai's machine gun angrily sounded behind the enemy. Two bursts of bullets killed four enemies, wounded one, and the rest fled.
    The enemy continued to fail, and the enemy continued to increase. Seeing the excessive disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, Wu Tiancai and his men all joined the "Yunnan People's Army to Punish Chiang and Save Themselves" led by General Zhu Jiabi.
    Their first battle after joining the army was to attack Shizong County. In this battle, Wu Tiancai personally captured the pseudo-county magistrate Bao Guoxiang, who was trying to disguise himself and hide. The counter-sweep was launched in Shizong. One day, Wu Tiancai and two others were on sentry duty on a mountain near Machang, when they suddenly discovered a team of enemies coming towards them. He raised his machine gun and fired, and a burst of bullets killed or wounded eighteen enemies. From then on, Wu Tiancai became a machine gunner who hit every shot. The team withdrew from Shizong to Mile. The enemy tracked them and pursued them. When they arrived at Sanjia Village, the superiors ordered Wu Tiancai to lead sixteen soldiers to ambush the enemy. The enemy's advance guard platoon passed! He didn't allow them to fire. The main force passed! He still didn't allow them to fire. When the rearguard was about to pass, he ordered a fierce attack. Just at this time, the front troops also counterattacked from the rear, and the enemy was attacked from both sides, holding their heads and scurrying around, with thirty-three dead and wounded, and completely collapsed.
    On the evening of May 16th, it was raining heavily, and the troops arrived under the city of Guangnan. This city was originally intended to be liberated by means of internal cooperation, but now there was a problem with the liaison, and it was clear that things could not proceed according to plan. At the same time, everyone understood that withdrawing now would inevitably cause meaningless casualties. The situation became a difficult problem for the commanders. At this time, Wu Tiancai stepped forward and offered to find a way to sneak into the city and open the city gate himself. He led the troops to the city gate, temporarily handed over his beloved machine gun to the soldiers, hung four bombs on his waist, and crawled into the city through the unimaginable, narrow, and foul-smelling mud-filled waterway. When he opened the city gate and took back his gun, he immediately ran up the city tower and captured thirteen prisoners. At this time, the troops had all poured into the city, and Wu Tiancai, with two soldiers, attacked eastward along the city wall, and in another blockhouse, they captured another forty-six men.
    In July of that year, the hero Wu Tiancai gloriously became a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.
    In October, the team returned to the original place to fight again. Unexpectedly, they suddenly ran into the enemy on the road. At that time, many combatants were having malaria attacks, and Wu Tiancai was one of them. The enemy suddenly rushed over, and Detachment Leader Li Rongxing, with a guard and Wu Tiancai, were surrounded on a hillside. The detachment leader was wounded.
    A company of enemies, without firing their guns, almost hand-in-hand surrounded them, obviously wanting to capture them alive. The three of them sat back-to-back. Each held their own weapon. Wu Tiancai was running a high fever, not shooting, and not speaking. The enemy was only ten meters away from them. Suddenly, Wu Tiancai's machine gun fired, which was completely unexpected by the enemy. The enemy turned and ran, and Wu Tiancai stood up and strafed the enemy's backs. He fired so fiercely that the enemy dared not turn their heads. Wu Tiancai carried the detachment leader on his back and walked two li of mountain road before catching up with the team.
    Wu Tiancai's struggle, in the national people's liberation movement, finally enabled the Axi people to turn themselves over. (Attached picture)

　　阿西族机枪手武天才
    屈辱和痛苦，燃烧起痛恨敌人的火焰，消灭敌人，解放阿西族。
    一九二八年一月间，英雄武天才诞生在云南省弥勒县西山区阿雨庵村的阿西族贫农之家。全家十口人，二亩田，日子像水一样清贫。
    武天才七岁就当了“牧牛郎”。正像武天才自己感觉的：那时候人比牛更难过。人和牛一样劳作，牛能吃饱草，而人却不能吃饱饭。英雄的童年，就这样的在饥饿穷困的苦海中漂过。
    一九四四年，他已经长大了。一天蒋介石匪帮命令保长把武天才捆绑起来，送到匪部二十二师去当兵。
    在蒋匪二十二师，武天才和其他六个阿西人编在一个班里。武天才说：在那里说是当兵，其实是当牛。官长除掉给他们辱骂、鞭打和调笑之外，一切都没有。
    屈辱和痛苦，培养着更深的仇恨。一九四七年的早春，武天才逃回了阿雨庵。自此以后，他走上了革命的道路。有一天，当地有个共产党员杨志庭，暗暗地告诉他：“阿西人要翻身，只有想法打倒蒋朝廷！”
    “星星之火，可以燎原。”武天才用杨志庭的话，聚拢了二十多个同样在心里埋着仇恨的阿西青年。他们常常跟着武天才的牛群到山上开会，想办法。不久这二十多个膀宽腰圆的汉子，全部参加了竹园镇公所的乡丁队。
    一九四七年的一个冬夜，挂钟已经响过了十二点。很冷，风像游击队的口哨似的呼叫在山腰上的树林里。乡丁队的官长们，把身子蜷的像虾米一样，正在吸着鸦片。这时正轮到武天才他们二十多人巡夜。他们完全和往常一样走出了镇公所，一直向着西山区古老的森林走去。他们带走了不化代价的步枪三十五支，冲锋枪两支，手枪五支，子弹六千发，特别是武天才还扛了一挺轻机枪。
    到了山上之后，武天才要大家在山上休整和学习，自己化装跑下山，到阿西族的各个村舍去宣传。很快又有八十七位阿西青年参加了，于是武天才在弥勒西山组成了强壮的民兵队。
    人民力量的成长，对于敌人是极不愉快的事。
    第二年春天到来的时候，弥勒县大恶霸保安队长鲁国祥，带领大队士兵，向武天才的民兵队进攻来了。武天才带着他的民兵队，用长矛、土枪和他们那些没化代价带来的武器，在马鹿村的岩岸上与敌激剧作战五小时。匪军溃散了，民兵队一直追到鲁国祥的家屋——杨林寨。缴获冲锋枪一支，大马一匹。
    这一次的胜利引起了更多敌人的注意。蒋匪二十六军的一个团，为镇压竹园镇的暴动，开到弥勒县来了。
    武天才的这一百个土生土长的民兵，散伏在茂密的山林，与敌人日夜不停的斗争。
    有一次，武天才扛着自己的机枪，带着两个民兵，和敌人偶然遭遇在一个山岗上。几十个敌人向他猛打过来。武天才一闪便跳下山沟里。等到敌人正感迷惑的时候，武天才的机枪又愤恨的在敌人背后响起来。两梭子弹，打死四个敌人，伤一人，其余逃散了。
    敌人不断的失败，敌人也不断的增加。武天才看到敌我力量的过分悬殊，他们就全部参加了朱家璧将军领导的“云南人民讨蒋自救军”。
    他们参军后第一次作战，是袭击师宗县城。在这次战斗里，武天才亲手捉住了企图化装隐藏的伪县长保国祥。反扫荡在师宗展开了。一天，武天才等三人在马厂附近的山上放哨，忽然发现一队敌人迎面走来，他端起机枪就打，一梭子弹，敌人死伤了十八个。从此以后，武天才成了百发百中的机枪手。队伍从师宗撤回弥勒。敌人跟踪追击，到三家村的时候，上级指定武天才带十六个战士伏击敌人。敌人尖兵排过去了！他不许打。本队过去了！他还不许打。后卫快过完时，他才命令猛烈射击了。恰在这时，前面部队也向后反击过来，敌人前后挨打，抱头乱窜，死伤三十三人，全部溃退。
    五月十六日晚间下着大雨，部队来到广南城下。这座城本来是打算用里应外合的办法来解放的，可是现在联络出了问题，显然事情是不能按照计划进行了。同时，谁也懂得现在要想撤退，必然造成毫无意义的伤亡。情况在指挥员面前成了难题。这时，武天才挺身而出，愿意自己设法钻进城去开城门。他把部队带到城门口，把亲爱的机枪暂时交给战士，腰里挂上四颗炸弹，从那令人不能设想的狭小而又被污臭的泥浆淤塞着的水道里钻进城去。当他开开城门，接过自己的枪的时候，立即就跑上城楼，捉住十三个俘虏。这时队伍已经全部涌进城来，武天才带着两个战士，顺城墙向东打去，在另一个堡楼里，他们又捉了四十六名。
    就在这年七月，英雄武天才光荣的成为中国新民主主义青年团员。
    十月，队伍重新返回原地作战。实在没想到，在路上和敌人突然碰了头。当时许多战斗员都正在发着“摆子”，武天才也是其中之一。敌人忽然猛冲过来，支队长李荣兴带着一个警卫员和武天才三个人，被围在一个山坡上。支队长负了伤。
    一连敌人，不打枪，几乎是手拉手的围上来，很明显是想要活捉他们的。他们三个人背靠背的坐着。各人拿着自己的武器。武天才全身发着高热，不射击，也不说话。敌人离他们只有十公尺了。突然，武天才的机枪响起来，这是敌人完全没有想到的。敌人翻身就跑，武天才更站起来向敌人的脊背扫射。打得敌人不敢回头。武天才背上支队长，赶了两华里的山路，才赶上了队伍。
    武天才的斗争，在全国人民解放运动中，使阿西人也终于翻过身来了。（附图片）
