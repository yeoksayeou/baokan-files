The Beijing Municipal Cotton Yarn Company, in the Spirit of Rectification,
    Examines Cotton Purchasing Work Over the Past Year
    Decides to Cooperate with Industrial and Commercial Departments to Strengthen Market Management and Overcome Bureaucracy in Storage Work
    [This newspaper dispatch] Correspondent Yuan Zhonghe reports: The China Cotton Yarn Company, Beijing Municipal Company, before accepting this year's task of purchasing raw cotton, conducted an inspection and summary of the previous stage (from August of last year to August of this year) of raw cotton purchasing work in the spirit of rectification. From the summary work, it was affirmed that there were great achievements in the past, but there were also many shortcomings and deviations.
    In terms of achievements, the company purchased 5.602 million jin of raw cotton in the past year, basically completing the estimated purchase quantity and providing the raw materials needed by the textile industry in a timely manner. It also correctly implemented the cotton-grain price ratio, ensuring the interests of cotton farmers. In addition, through purchasing and processing, it supported cooperatives and private cotton merchants and cotton processing industries. It united 25 private merchants who purchased raw cotton on its behalf, with these purchases accounting for one-tenth of the total purchases. Twenty-five ginneries were supported, with commissioned processing of raw cotton accounting for 80% of the total.
    The main manifestations of shortcomings and deviations were the failure to correctly implement the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests and the policy of freedom of trade. For example, a small number of cadres in the market took restrictive actions directly against private merchants, replacing the local government, emphasizing the implementation of license registration, and restricting the quantity of purchases and the entry and exit of seed cotton, which invisibly formed an exclusion of private merchants and affected the operation of their businesses. Phenomena that hindered public-private relations also occurred in the processing with private ginneries. For example, when the Zhuoxian branch company entrusted private merchants with processing, the contract stipulated that 60% of all cottonseed would be paid as processing fees. Afterwards, the Beijing Municipal Company discovered that the processing fees of the Nanyuan branch company were lower than those of Zhuoxian, so it forcibly ordered the Zhuoxian branch company to change the contract and reduce the processing fees to 55% of all cottonseed. This change caused dissatisfaction among private merchants with state-owned trading companies, who believed that the public could fail to fulfill contracts. Therefore, it was changed back to the original state. The main reason for these errors was that no serious investigation was conducted before the contract was signed, coupled with the cadres' insufficient understanding of the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests, and even the privileged thinking that "public should come before private." The single-minded task-oriented view of some cadres, eager to complete the purchase figures, also neglected the mastery of policies, which was one of the reasons for the errors.
    Secondly, in terms of mastering cotton prices, two biases also occurred: First, the grasp of regional price differences was not appropriate enough, sometimes forming a reverse flow of cotton. This not only caused a waste of transportation capacity, but also caused the stagnation of transportation and sales business because cotton merchants had no profit to make. Second, in mastering the price ratio between seed cotton and lint cotton, seed cotton was often higher than lint cotton. While this had a certain effect in ensuring quality and collecting good varieties, it also affected the operation of private merchants because they had no profit to make after purchasing seed cotton, processing it, and selling it.
    Again, fires occurred continuously in warehouse storage, exposing the serious bureaucracy and red tape in the leadership style of the Municipal Company. In order to deploy the three-prevention (fire prevention, anti-espionage, anti-theft) work, the company initially issued nearly a hundred documents (including instructions, measures, etc.) to lower-level branch companies, but the inspection work was very poor. A large number of instructions not only failed to improve cadres' vigilance against defense work, but on the contrary played a paralyzing role. Since the collection of cotton, there have been as many as 30 fires in picking, ginning, and cleaning. In March of this year alone, the Dingxing branch company suffered a fire because a cotton-picking worker accidentally struck a match on the ground, losing more than 9,000 jin of cotton.
    After this inspection and summary of raw cotton purchasing work, the company concluded that the following experiences should be noted in carrying out this work this year: 1. Strengthening market management should be carried out with the cooperation of local industrial and commercial departments, and under the firm implementation of the policy of freedom of trade, strictly prevent speculation from manipulating or driving up cotton prices, causing cotton turbulence, and harming the interests of cotton farmers. 2. In strengthening market management, attention should be paid to taking into consideration both public and private interests, preventing the privileged thinking of "public before private." State-owned companies should assist legitimate cotton merchants who purchase cotton. At the same time, when signing purchase or processing contracts with private merchants or cooperatives, careful consideration and thorough planning must be made in advance to avoid changes afterwards. 3. It is necessary to reasonably master the price of seed cotton and lint cotton and regional price differences so that transporters and sellers can make a profit and promote the appropriate exchange of materials. 4. Drawing on last year's fire prevention experience, resolutely overcome the bureaucratic leadership style. After each work instruction and work deployment, regular inspections and specific guidance should be carried out.

　　京市花纱布公司以整风精神
    检查一年来购棉工作
    决定配合工商部门加强市场管理并克服保管工作中的官僚主义
    【本报讯】通讯员袁忠和报道：中国花纱布公司北京市公司在接受今年收购原棉任务前，曾以整风精神对前一阶段（自去年八月至今年八月）收购原棉工作进行了检查与总结，从总结工作中，肯定过去是有很大成绩的，但也曾发生不少缺点和偏差。
    在成绩方面，该公司一年来收购了原棉五百六十万零二千斤，基本上完成了预计收购的数量，适时地供应了纺织工业所需原料。并正确地执行了棉粮比价，保证了棉农利益。此外，通过收购、加工，对合作社及私营棉商、棉花加工业进行了扶植。团结代购原棉的私商有二十五家，代购占总收购量的十分之一；被扶植的轧花业二十五家，委托加工原棉占总数百分之八十。
    缺点与偏差的主要表现是没有正确实行公私兼顾政策与贸易自由政策，如少数干部在市场上代替地方政权直接向私商采取限制行动，强调实行证照登记，限制收购数量和籽棉的进出，以致无形形成对私商的排挤，影响了私商业务的经营。在与私营轧花业进行加工中也曾发生妨碍公私关系的现象。如在涿县支公司委托私商加工时，合同议定以全部棉籽百分之六十为工缴费，其后北京市公司发现南苑支公司工缴费低于涿县，遂强令涿县支公司更改合同，降低工缴费为全部棉籽百分之五十五。由于这种更改，引起私商对国营贸易公司的不满，认为公家可以不履行合同。因而又改回原状。这些错误的造成，主要是因为订合同前没有认真调查，加上干部对公私兼顾政策认识不够明确，甚至有特权思想认为应该“先公后私”。有些干部的单纯任务观点，急于完成收购数字，便忽视了对政策的掌握，也是造成错误的原因之一。
    其次，表现在棉价的掌握上，也曾发生过两个偏向：第一是对于地区差价掌握不够适当，有时形成棉花逆流。这样不仅造成运输力的浪费，同时因棉商无利可图而形成运销业务的停滞。第二是在掌握籽棉与皮棉价格比例上，籽棉常高于皮棉，这样在保证质纯与收集优良品种上固有一定作用，但也因私商购进籽棉加工后出售无利，而影响其业务的进行。
    再次表现在仓库保管上曾连续发生火灾，暴露了市公司领导作风上存有严重的官僚主义与文牍主义。该公司为布置三防（防火、防特、防盗）工作，在初期就有近百件文件（包括指示、办法等）发给下级支公司，但检查工作则很差，大量的指示不仅没有提高干部对防卫工作的警惕，相反的起了麻痹作用，在收花以来在拣花、轧花、清花当中先后发生火灾有三十次之多，只今年三月间定兴支公司因拣花工人不慎擦着地上火柴而酿成一次火灾，就损失棉花九千余斤。
    该公司经过这次对收购原棉工作的检查与总结，得出了在今年进行这一工作中应该注意的几点经验：一、加强市场管理，应在当地工商部门的配合者进行，并在坚决执行贸易自由政策下，严防投机下操纵或哄抬棉价，造成棉花乱流，妨害棉农利益。二、在加强市场管理，应注意公私兼顾，防止“先公后私”的特权思想，国营公司应对正当收购棉商予以协助。同时与私商或合作社订定代购或加工合同时，必须事前慎重考虑，周密计划，避免事后更改。三、必须合理掌握籽棉与皮棉价格及地区差价，让运销者有利可图，促进物资适当交流。四、接受去年防火经验，坚决克服官僚主义的领导作风，在每一工作指示和工作布置后，应经常进行检查和具体指导。
