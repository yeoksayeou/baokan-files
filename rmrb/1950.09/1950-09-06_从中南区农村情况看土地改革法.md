　　Land Reform Law as Seen from the Rural Situation in Central South China
　　Zhang Gengsheng, Director of the Investigation and Research Department of the Land Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee

　　(1) The Necessity of Land Reform as Seen from the Land Ownership Status of Various Classes in Rural Central South China.

　　In his report on the land reform issue at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out that the reason why China had to carry out land reform was "because China's original land system was extremely unreasonable." However, when studying and researching land reform work documents in various parts of Central South China, some people raised the following different views in connection with the local conditions: "The seriously unreasonable phenomenon of China's land system refers to the whole country; as for the Yangtze River Basin and the Pearl River Basin, they are different from the Yellow River Basin and the Northeast." "Years of war have dispersed the land." "Land is dispersed in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, there are no big landlords, and most of the landlords have gone bankrupt." This seems to be saying that land reform in the South is not as important as in the North, because the landlords in the South are already very poor. Is this the actual situation? Our existing survey materials on the rural social classes in various provinces of Central South China can answer this question.

　　Based on the analysis of the entire economic structure of the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Guangdong, and Henan, and based on the analysis of the survey materials of 69 relatively representative and reliable townships, there are the following three types of areas in terms of the degree of land concentration:

　　1. Areas with the most dispersed land. According to the surveys of 21 villages including Xiaokou Village in Mianyang County, Hubei Province, Huangtupo Village and Shishan Village in Wuchang County, Guanying Village in Baofeng County and Suncun Village in Luoyang, Henan Province, and ten townships in Gaoan County and Fuxing Township in Yiyang County, Jiangxi Province, landlords account for 3% of the population and own more than 15% of the total land (including public land – school land, clan land, association land, etc.); rich peasants account for 5% of the population and about 15% of the land; middle peasants, poor peasants, farm laborers, and other working people account for about 92% of the population and own about 60% of the land. 2. Areas with a general degree of land concentration. According to the surveys of 25 villages including the First Administrative Village of the Third District of Hanyang, Hubei Province, Shiqiao Village in Huangpi County, Zhaotou Village in Luoyang, Henan Province, Xinfang Village in Yichun, Jiangxi Province, Xinping Township in Yuanling, Hunan Province, and Shuibei Village in Longchuan, Guangdong Province, landlords account for slightly more than 3% of the population and 30% of the land (including public land); rich peasants account for 5% to 6% of the population and 15% of the land; middle peasants, poor peasants, farm laborers, and other working people account for more than 90% of the population and own 50% of the land. 3. Areas with concentrated land. According to the surveys of 23 villages including Xinyi Village in Huangpi, Hubei Province, Luowandi Village in Huangchuan, Henan Province, one village in Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, and Hefeng Township in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, landlords account for 3% to 4% of the population and 50% of the land (including public land), with the most reaching 90% (including public land); rich peasants account for 5% of the population and more than 15% of the land; middle peasants, poor peasants, farm laborers, and other working people account for more than 90% of the population and own 20% to 30% of the land. According to the above three different types of areas, and based on the detailed survey materials of various provinces, we studied the proportion of these three types of areas in the entire Central South China region. The result of the study is roughly: 1. Areas with concentrated land account for about 45% of the rural population of the entire region, that is, about 60 million people. 2. Areas with a general degree of land concentration account for about 40%, that is, about 50 million people. 3. Areas with dispersed land account for about 15%, that is, about 15 million people. If we compare the situations of various provinces, the degree of land concentration in Hunan and Guangdong provinces is the highest, with the areas with concentrated land accounting for about 70% to 80% of the rural population of the entire province; followed by Hubei Province, with the areas with concentrated land accounting for about 40% of the entire province's population; and the land in Jiangxi and Henan provinces is relatively dispersed.

　　Secondly, from the perspective of changes in land ownership since the Great Revolution. There have been changes, especially in some areas of Jiangxi and Hubei. In these areas, after the Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, land is more dispersed than in the past; but from the above survey materials, in most areas, the landlord class still occupies more than 30% to 50% of the land. The current situation is: the average agricultural population in the entire region has about 1.5 to 2 mu of land per person, while landlords have an average of 10 to 20 mu per person, and poor peasants have only half a mu. That is to say, one landlord still exceeds the average number of all agricultural population per person by more than ten times, and if compared with the land of poor peasants now, it is 30 to 40 times more. In addition, it is worth noting that during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, many reactionary bureaucrats and landlords took the opportunity to seize a large amount of land, so in some areas such as Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and most areas of Hunan province, the land not only did not disperse, but became more concentrated. Many big landlords in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan colluded with the puppet government to seize land near the lake on a large scale, reaching nearly 10,000 mu every year. Local farmers have the saying "a land in sight," meaning that all the land seen by the eye belongs to the landlords. In Hefeng Township, Xiangyin County, there are a total of 20,000 dou of fields, and landlords occupy 14,000 dou; more than 1,300 farmers have only 5,000 dou. The warlords and bureaucrats in Guangdong all occupy a very large amount of land. According to a survey of four villages in Xingguo, Jiangxi Province, after the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north to resist Japan, four big landlords increased their grain fields by 6,200 dan; among them, Xie Sifeng, a big landlord in Fenglin Village, originally had 4,200 dan of fields, and now increased to 6,000 dan. Yao Yinan, a big landlord in the northern township of Fuliang, originally had 4,000 mu of land, and after the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army withdrew, he seized another 7,000 mu, now totaling 11,000 mu.

　　From the above situation, it can be seen that the wars since the Great Revolution have caused a certain degree of change in land ownership, but the actual situation is that most of the land is still concentrated in the hands of a small number of feudal landlords. From this, it can be proved that the rural land situation in the Jiangnan area is not more dispersed than in the North. If we compare the situation of the landlord class with that of the poor peasants, then land reform in the newly liberated areas of Central South China is also the most important work that must be carried out, just like in other parts of the country, and now the peasants in various places have also actively put forward such demands. At the conference of peasant representatives in Hubei Province held in March, more than 80 of the more than 200 proposals put forward by representatives from various places were requests for land reform. The Jiangxi Gannan Administrative Office receives an average of 25 to 30 letters from peasants requesting land reform every day. Many of these letters are jointly written by dozens of peasants. In short, judging from the rural situation survey in the newly liberated areas of Central South China, land reform is warmly welcomed and hoped for by more than 120 million peasants in the entire region. The "Southern Special Theory" is completely unfounded.

　　(2) Several Important Policies of the Land Reform Law as Seen from the Situation of Various Classes in Rural Central South China.

　　The Land Reform Law correctly stipulates various policies, and according to the materials obtained from our investigation, it completely conforms to the actual situation of the rural areas in the newly liberated areas of Central South China.

　　1. The Landlord Class's Cruel Exploitation of Peasants

　　A. An Investigation Material

　　Huang Buyun, a landlord in the 11th Bao of Langli Township, First District, Changsha County, Hunan Province, has more than 2,000 dan of fields, all of which are rented out. In addition to the exploitation of deposits and extra gifts and helping with work, the rent is 50%, and no reduction is allowed regardless of drought, flood, or insect disaster; the deposit is equal to the rent; the rent grain must be winnowed twice and delivered to the warehouse, allowing the peasants to send it to Changsha; if the tenants pay the rent in cash, they must also pay 2 jiao of silver ocean per dan as transportation fee.

　　Wu Bingming, a farmer of the 5th Jia of the Bao, and his four brothers jointly rented 520 dan of grain fields (calculated according to output) from the Huang family in the ninth year of the Republic of China, with a deposit of 1,240 silver oceans and a rent of 240 dan, and had to pay an additional 62 dan of interest grain every year. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Wu family returned 80 dan of grain fields, and the deposit of 600 silver oceans should be refunded, but the landlord only returned 600 circulation coupons, worth only 100 silver oceans. For more than 30 years, the Huang family asked the Wu family to give gifts and help with work for every wedding and funeral. For the Huang family's birthday alone, Wu Bingming and others helped with work for 60 days. In the twelfth, twenty-ninth, and thirty-fourth years of the Republic of China, there were droughts, and there were only five or six years of good harvests, and the rent was not allowed to be reduced, resulting in all the grain being taken away. In addition, the contract also stated that the tenants had to carry the landlord's sedan chair for 50 days a year. Wang Youguang and other farmers of the 10th Bao rented 100 dan of grain fields from the Huang family. The original rent was 30 dan, but it was increased to 56 dan in the second year. In total, the Huang family received more than 1,000 dan of rent a year, and exploited the peasants by lending out the deposits at high interest rates. The family mostly lived in Changsha, living a life of luxury and debauchery.

　　The above is just a common example of the exploitation of peasants by the entire landlord class, and it can be seen how deep the sins of the entire landlord class are.

　　B. The vast majority of the landlord class completely relies on rent for their livelihood, and they never care about production. Among the 19 landlord households in Xinfang Village, Nanmiao District, Yichun County, Jiangxi Province, only three households hire laborers and manage part of the land themselves, while the remaining 16 households completely rely on rent for their livelihood, and only 80 mu of their 1,300 mu of land are managed and cultivated by themselves. The landlord class occupies a large amount of land, not only does not participate in labor themselves, but even does not care about the management of production at all. Although the peasants are very willing to manage the land well, because most of their income is taken away by the landlords, they do not have the ability to manage it well.

　　C. The serious feudal clan society rule in the southern rural areas is one of the poisonous means by which the landlord class exploits peasants. The heads of households, fangzhangs, clan leaders, and society leaders in various places are almost all controlled by landlords and bullies. They have supreme power over the peasants and carry out various illegal exploitations. In many villages in Jiangxi, in addition to the clan leaders, there are also more than 20 or 30 kinds of societies, such as the Red Gang, the Green Gang, the New Construction Association, the Property Protection Group, the Military New Construction Society, the Biao Association, the Tang Association, the Seven Branch Association, the Nine Branch Association, the Four-Year Group, the Shrine, etc. In places with the most societies, such as Changjing Village in Xingguo County, there are as many as 95 kinds. These societies all occupy a considerable amount of land, and these lands are also completely manipulated by landlords and bullies, who collect rent and manage them, embezzle and misappropriate them at will, and many lands are gradually occupied by them. According to surveys in Xiang, Gan, and the Jiangnan area of Hubei, public clan fields generally account for more than 10% to 15% of all cultivated land, while in Guangdong they generally account for 30%, and the most is in the Xijiang area, usually accounting for 40%, and in Shunde County it accounts for 60%.

　　From the above situation, it can be seen that a small number of the landlord class occupies most of the entire cultivated land, and each landlord usually has more than ten times the average number of all agricultural population per person. This shows that each landlord has taken away the land that dozens of peasants should have, and each person in the landlord class is sucking the blood and sweat of dozens of poor peasants. Of course, those big landlords who own thousands or even tens of thousands of dan of fields have an even greater scope of exploitation. They only hinder production and do not have any benefits. Therefore, the Land Reform Law stipulates that all land of the landlord class should be confiscated and all public fields such as ancestral halls, temples, monasteries, schools, and social organizations should be expropriated and distributed to landless and land-poor peasants, which is completely reasonable. Only in this way can the lives of peasants be improved, and can they have the strength to expand reproduction and develop agricultural production.

　　2. Investigation and Analysis of Rich Peasant Economy

　　A. As can be seen from the aforementioned survey materials, rich peasants generally account for about 5% of the population in Central South China and own about 15% of the land. From the perspective of the average amount of land owned per person, it is generally equivalent to twice the local average per person, and some even reach more than three times. For example, in three villages including Shiqiao Village in Huangpi County, Hubei Province and Lianqiao Village in Xishui, the average land per person is 1.28 dan, while rich peasants have 4.57 dan per person.

　　Compared by region, the rich peasant economy accounts for a larger proportion in most of Henan, the areas along the Yangtze River in Hubei, and the old Soviet areas in Jiangxi. In some villages, the rich peasants have more land than the landlords, and some even account for more than 20% of the total land.

　　B. Many of the rich peasants in the rural areas of Central South China rent out land. According to a survey of 32 villages in 13 counties in Henan Province, 141 out of 422 rich peasant households rented out land, accounting for 33% of the total number of households, and the land rented out accounted for 35% of their total land. According to a survey of 15 bao in three counties including Changsha, Hunan Province, there are a total of 256 rich peasant households, of which 48% rent out land, and the land rented out accounts for 42% of all their land. The feudal nature of the rich peasants in Huangsha Township, Shangyou, Jiangxi Province is even stronger. The 28 rich peasant households have a total of 1,979.8 mu of land, only 1,001 mu of which are cultivated by themselves, 15 long-term workers are hired, and the rest is all rented out. Only one of the 28 households does not rent out land, and 18 households lend money at high interest rates. The income from land rent and high-interest loans accounts for almost two-thirds of their total exploitation income. Among them, there are 10 households whose rented land exceeds the land cultivated by themselves and hired people, which are so-called semi-landlord rich peasants.

　　C. Rich peasants generally have better means of production. According to the survey of five townships including Mingwang Township, Lituo Township, Qiutang Township in Changsha and Hefeng Township in Xiangyin County, and Zhenzhong Township in Shaoyang County, rich peasants all account for about 20% of all cultivated livestock, and other agricultural tools such as waterwheels, plows, and rakes are also more complete.

　　According to the above investigation and analysis, the provisions of the Land Reform Law on the policy of rich peasants are completely in line with the situation in the Central South region. Generally speaking, preserving the rich peasant economy, protecting the land cultivated by rich peasants themselves and the land managed by hired workers, and retaining a small amount of rented land are of great significance for isolating the landlord class, uniting the middle peasants, and stabilizing the mood for production. Moreover, in general areas, not moving the land of rich peasants, only confiscating and expropriating the land of landlords and public land and distributing it to landless and land-poor peasants can roughly solve the land problem of poor and hired peasants. Each person can get about 70% to 80% of the average amount of land in the whole village. If the people's government actively leads and supports production, and the peasants actively manage it themselves, they can seek initial improvement in living standards and increase some capacity for expanded reproduction, and further develop agricultural production. However, on the other hand, there are indeed some areas, such as northern and central Henan, and the old Soviet areas in Jiangxi, southern Hunan, and the areas along the Yangtze River in Hubei, where the land is relatively dispersed, and rich peasants own a lot of land (accounting for about 15% to 20% of all land), and rent out a large amount of land. In such areas, if part of the rented land of rich peasants is not expropriated, the land obtained by poor and hired peasants will be too little. According to the investigation of the above typical villages, some (such as Huangtupo Village in Wuchang, Hubei) can only get 50% of the average of the entire village, or even less than 50%, so that the vast majority of poor peasants cannot even maintain the minimum living standards. Therefore, in such areas, it is completely correct to expropriate part or all of the rented land of rich peasants with the approval of organs above the provincial people's government.

　　Secondly, it is extremely beneficial to the development of production to expropriate the rented part of the land of so-called semi-landlord rich peasants and distribute it to poor peasants. Because they rent out a large amount of land, they themselves have lived a semi-parasitic life. If they are retained, there is no benefit to production. Therefore, in the above two situations, expropriating part or all of the large amount of land rented out by rich peasants is completely consistent with the purpose of preserving the rich peasant economy in order to facilitate the restoration and development of agricultural production.

　　3. Small Land Lessors

　　According to the survey of three villages including Xinyi Village, Shiqiao Village, and Huangtupo Village in Huangpi, Hubei Province, there are generally some handicraft workers, peddlers, doctors, teachers, and individual disabled, orphaned, widowed, and elderly people in the countryside who own more land than the average peasants and rent it out. The average amount of land they own is less than twice the local average per person, and generally speaking, their lives are not particularly wealthy. Moreover, they were originally mostly laborers, and their land mostly came from labor. Now our country does not have social insurance for these people. Once they lose their land, they will have no way to live; moreover, the number of these people is small, and the proportion of land they occupy is not large (generally 3% to 5%), and the adverse impact on rural production is also small. Therefore, the provisions of Article 5 of the Land Reform Law are extremely necessary. The experience of land reform in Henan proves that this policy is quite satisfactory and sympathetic to the vast majority of people. Although the poor peasants get a little less land (only a few li of land per person), they can get broader social sympathy; and it helps to stabilize social order.

　　4. Consolidating the Unity of Middle Peasants

　　Middle peasants do not have as large a proportion in the rural areas of the newly liberated areas as in the old liberated areas of North China, and the land they own is not as much as that of the middle peasants in the old liberated areas. In provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, middle peasants generally account for about 30% of the population and slightly more than 30% of the land; in some areas of Guangdong, it is even less, with some accounting for only more than 10% of the population. Therefore, in the rural areas of Central South China, many middle peasants rent part of the land of landlords and rich peasants because they have little land themselves. Among the 119 middle peasant households in Xinyi Village, Huangpi County, 38 households rent part of the land. In other places, usually one-third of the middle peasants are also tenants. Therefore, in this spring's rent reduction, middle peasants actively participated in the movement and joined the peasant associations. The Land Reform Law also stipulates the protection of the property of middle peasants and generally does not move the property of rich peasants, which will inevitably help to stabilize the production mood of middle peasants and political unity. But in addition to this, attention should also be paid to the fact that when distributing land, we must take appropriate care of the original farmers in extracting and distributing the land of landlords in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Land Reform Law, which is extremely important for both restoring and developing production and consolidating the unity of middle peasants.

　　5. Poor Peasants, Farm Laborers, and Other Working People

　　It can be seen from the aforementioned materials that poor peasants and farm laborers in the rural areas of various provinces in Central South China generally account for more than 50% of the total number of households and more than 50% of the total population (farm laborers account for about 10% of the total number of households, 8% of the population, and 0.5% of the land), and only own about 15% of the land. In the 16th Bao of Zhenyan Township, Yiyang, Hunan Province, the total number of households is 1,203, and the number of hired poor peasants is 781, accounting for 65% of the total number of households (if manual workers and other working people are included, there are 882 households), and the land they own is generally only one-fifth of the average of the entire village, and there are 259 extremely poor households that have no land at all. The lives of these poor peasants cannot be maintained by cultivating their own land alone, so 70% to 80% of the poor peasants have to rent the land of landlords or borrow high-interest loans from landlords. They work hard all day long, but most of what they earn in a year is taken away by the landlords, which is not enough to eat or wear. As a result, many peasants have had even their own small amount of self-cultivated land taken away by the landlords, and they have to become hired workers, and even forced to wander around to make a living.

　　The number of farm laborers is also large in the Jiangnan area, usually accounting for about 10% of the total number of households, but the land they own is less than 1% of the total amount of land, that is, eight or nine out of ten households have no land at all. The wages of hired workers are also very low. In the 10th Bao of Langli Township, Changsha, Hunan Province, there are a total of 58 hired workers, of which only one has the highest wage, only 26 dan of grain a year, 34 have 10 dan to 20 dan of grain, 12 have 5 dan to 6 dan of grain, and 11 (including two female workers) have only 3 dan to 4 dan of grain. In addition to providing meals for the hired workers, the employers do not care about anything else. If they are sick, the employers not only do not provide medical treatment, but also deduct wages for missed work during the illness. In Dingtun Village, 2nd District, Fengcheng, Jiangxi Province, the wages of hired workers were originally only 15 dan of grain a year, but this year they have been reduced to 7 dan. Moreover, in many areas, many hired workers have been laid off, so their lives are even more difficult.

　　In addition, there are also more manual workers, peddlers, and self-employed people in the rural areas of the South. In provinces such as Hunan and Guangdong, they account for about 10% of the total number of households and the population, while in Hubei and Jiangxi they are slightly worse, accounting for about 5%, and in Henan Province they are the least, accounting for about 1% or 2%. In the rural areas near the suburbs of cities, some individual places account for about 20%. The land they own is generally very little, mostly accounting for only 1% or 2% of all land. Before and after liberation, because the relationship between urban and rural areas has not become normal, and the sales of some handicraft products have decreased, some people also feel difficult in their lives. They hope to be able to get a share of land in the land reform, which is a problem that should be paid attention to in the land reform.

　　Overall, poor peasants, farm laborers, manual workers, peddlers, etc. account for more than 60% to 70% of the rural population, and only own 10% to 15% of the land, especially in Hunan and Guangdong provinces, where the extremely poor peasants who have no land at all account for more than 15% of the total number of households, and even 20% to 30%; therefore, the vast majority of hired poor peasants, more than 80 million in the entire Central South region, most urgently demand the rapid implementation of land reform in order to obtain a considerable amount of land, so as to facilitate the restoration and development of production. This is also the reason why land reform must rely on the hired poor peasants to unite the middle peasants.

　　从中南区农村情况看土地改革法
    中南军政委员会土地委员会  调查研究处处长  张根生
    （一）从中南区的农村各阶级土地占有状况来看土地改革的必要。
    刘少奇副主席在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上关于土地改革问题的报告中，指出中国之所以要实行土地改革，“就是因为中国原来的土地制度极不合理”。但在中南区各地联系本地区情况学习与研究土改工作的文件时，有人却提出了以下不同的说法：“中国土地制度的严重不合理现象，是指全国说的；至于长江流域及珠江流域，则不同于黄河流域和东北。”“连年战争，土地分散了。”“长江中游土地分散，没有什么大地主，地主已大部破产了。”这好像在说，土地改革在南方不如在北方重要，理由是南方地主已经很穷。这是不是实际情况呢？我们现有的中南区各省农村社会阶级情况的调查材料，可以解答这一问题。
    根据湘、鄂、赣、粤、豫五省整个经济结构的分析，根据比较有代表性的也是比较可靠的六十九个乡的调查材料的分析，从土地集中的程度来看，有下述三类地区：
    一、土地最分散的地区。根据湖北沔阳县小河口村、武昌县黄土坡村、石山村，河南宝丰县官营村、洛阳孙村，江西高安十个乡、弋阳县复兴乡等二十一个村的调查，地主占人口的百分之三，占有全部土地的百分之十五以上（包括公田——学田、族田、会社田等）；富农占人口的百分之五，土地的百分之十五左右；中农、贫农、雇农及其他劳动人民约占人口的百分之九十二，占有土地的百分之六十左右。二、土地集中程度一般的地区。根据湖北汉阳三区第一行政村、黄陂县石桥村，河南洛阳冢头村，江西宜春新坊村，湖南沅陵信平乡，广东龙川水背村等二十五个村的调查，地主占人口的百分之三强，土地的百分之三十（包括公田）；富农占人口的百分之五至百分之六，土地的百分之十五；中农、贫农、雇农及其他劳动人民占人口的百分之九十以上，占有土地的百分之五十。三、土地集中地区。根据湖北黄陂新义村，河南潢川罗弯地村，江西南昌一个村，湖南湘阴县和丰乡等二十三个村的调查，地主占人口的百分之三至四，土地的百分之五十（包括公田），最多的达到百分之九十（包括公田）；富农占人口的百分之五，土地的百分之十五以上；中农、贫农、雇农及其他劳动人民占人口的百分之九十以上，占土地的百分之二十到三十。按照以上三种不同类型地区，根据各省的详细调查材料，我们研究了这三种类型地区在整个中南地区中所占的比重。研究的结果大致是：一、土地集中地区，约占全区农村人口的百分之四十五左右，即约有六千万人口的地区；二、土地集中程度一般的地区，约占百分之四十，即约有五千万人口的地区。三、土地分散地区，约有百分之十五左右，即约有一千五百万人口的地区。如再把各省情况加以比较，则湘、粤两省的土地集中程度最大，其土地集中地区约占全省农村人口的百分之七十至八十；次为湖北省，土地集中地区约占全省人口的百分之四十；赣、豫二省的土地则比较分散。
    其次从大革命以来土地占有状况的变化上来看。这种变化是有的，尤以江西、湖北一部地区较显著。在这些地区，经过大革命，土地革命，抗日战争，解放战争，土地比之过去是分散了一些；但从上述的调查材料来看，在绝大多数地区，地主阶级却仍然占有了百分之三十到五十以上的土地。现在的情况是：全区农业人口每人平均约合土地一亩半到二亩，而地主平均每人则有十亩到二十亩，贫农却不过半亩。这就是说，地主一人仍超过全部农业人口每人平均数的十倍以上，如和现在贫农的土地比较，则要多三、四十倍。此外值得注意的是，在国民党反动统治时期，不少反动官僚及地主趁机霸占了大批土地，所以有些地区如粤、桂两省及湘省大部地区，土地不但没有分散，反而更形集中。湖南洞庭湖滨许多大地主勾结伪政府大肆霸占滨湖土地，每年即近万亩以上。当地农民有“一望之地”的说法，意思是说，只要用眼望到的土地，全归地主所有。湘阴县和丰乡共有二万斗田，地主即占有一万四千斗；农民一千三百余人，只有五千斗。广东的军阀官僚都占有极大量的土地。据江西兴国四个村调查，在中国工农红军北上抗日之后，四户大地主就增加了六千二百石谷田；其中枫林村大地主谢思风，原有田四千二百石，现在增至六千石。浮梁北乡区大地主姚以南，原有地四千亩，在工农红军撤退后，又霸占了七千亩，现在共有一万一千亩。
    从以上情况可以看出，大革命以来的战争，曾使土地占有状况发生了一定程度的变化，但实际情况是，绝大部分的土地依然集中在少数封建地主手中。从此可以证明：江南的农村土地情况，并不比北方分散。如果把地主阶级和贫苦农民的情况对比一下，那么，土地改革之在中南新解放区也和在全国其他地区同样是必须进行的一项最重要的工作，现在各地农民也积极提出了这样的要求。三月间举行的湖北省农民代表会上，各地代表提出的二百多件提案中，就有八十几件是要求实行土改的。江西赣西南行政公署每天平均接到农民要求土改的信件达二十五封到三十封之多，这些信件，许多是几十个农民联名写的。总之，从中南新解放区农村的情况调查来看，土地改革是为全区一亿二千万以上的广大农民所热烈欢迎和希望的。“南方特殊论”，是毫无根据的。
    （二）从中南区农村各阶级情况来看土地改革法的几项重要政策。
    土地改革法正确地规定了各种政策，根据我们调查所得材料来看，它完全合乎中南新解放区农村的实际情况。
    一、地主阶级对农民的残酷剥削
    甲、一个调查材料
    湖南长沙县一区榔黎乡十一保地主黄步云，有田二千余石，全部出租。除去押金及额外之送礼、帮工等剥削外，租额是百分之五十，无论水旱虫灾，一律不减；其押金与租额相等；租谷要经二次风车，指仓交纳，让农民送往长沙；佃户拿钱折租，每石还要交纳银洋二角作运费。
    该保五甲农民吴丙明，弟兄四人，民国九年合佃黄家五百二十石谷田（按产量计），押金银洋一千二百四十元，租额二百四十石，每年另须支付利息谷六十二石。民国十年，吴家退佃八十石谷田，应退押金六百元，但地主只退给流通券六百，仅值银洋一百元。三十余年来，黄家每逢婚丧，全要吴家送礼、帮工，仅黄家一次作寿，吴丙明等即帮工六十天。民国十二年，二十九年，三十四年皆遇旱灾，仅有五六成年景，租额亦不准减，结果将全部粮食夺去。此外契约上还载明佃户每年给地主抬轿五十天。十保农民王佑光等佃耕黄家一百石谷田，原定租额三十石，第二年即加租五十六石。总计黄家一年收租千石以上，并把收取之押金放高利贷剥削农民。一家人大都住在长沙，过着花天酒地的生活。
    以上还只是整个地主阶级剥削农民的一个平常事例，也就可以看到整个地主阶级的罪恶是如何深重了。
    乙、地主阶级绝大部分完全靠地租生活，他们对生产从不过问。江西宜春县南庙区新坊村的十九户地主中，只有三户雇有雇工，自己经营一部土地，其余十六户则完全靠地租生活，其一千三百亩土地中也只有八十亩是自己经营耕种。地主阶级占有大量土地，不但自己不参加劳动甚至连生产的经营也丝毫不加过问，农民虽极愿好好经营土地，但因其收入多被地主夺去，没有能力去很好经营。
    丙、南方农村中严重的封建宗族会社统治，是地主阶级剥削农民的毒辣手段之一。各地的户长、方长、族长、会社长差不多都被地主恶霸所掌握，他们对农民有无上权力，并进行各种非法剥削。江西许多村庄除宗族长外，还有二三十种以上的会社，如红帮、青帮、新建会、保产团、军界建新社、标会、堂会、七支会、九支会、四年团、神社等等。会社最多的地方如兴国县长径村，竟有九十五种之多。这些会社都占有相当大量的土地，这些土地也完全为地主恶霸所操纵，归他们收租管理，任意贪污挪用，不少土地则逐渐被他们据为己有。据湘、赣及湖北江南地区调查，公族田一般皆占全部耕地的百分之十至百分之十五以上，广东则一般皆占百分之三十，最多的是西江地区，通常都占百分之四十，顺德县则占到百分之六十。
    从以上情况来看，少数的地主阶级占有了整个耕地的大部，每个地主通常都要比全部农业人口每人平均数多十倍以上。这就说明了，每个地主都夺去了几十个农民应有的土地，地主阶级每人都在吸吮着几十个贫苦农民的血汗。当然那些据有几千石田，甚至几万石田的大地主，其剥削范围也就更大了。他们对生产只有障碍，没有一点好处。因之土地改革法规定没收地主阶级一切土地及征收一切祠堂、庙宇、寺院、学校、会社团体等公田，分配给无地少地农民，是完全合理的。也只有这样，农民生活才能得到改善，才有力量去扩大再生产，以发展农业生产。
    二、对富农经济的调查与分析
    甲、根据前述的调查材料已可看出：富农在中南区一般占人口的百分之五左右，占有土地的百分之十五左右，如从其占有土地的每人平均数来看，一般相当于当地每人平均数的二倍，有的则到三倍以上。如湖北黄陂石桥村浠水连桥村等三村，每人平均土地一·二八斗，富农每人则有四·五七斗。
    按地区来比较，则河南的大部、湖北的沿江地区以及江西的老苏区，富农经济比重较大，有些村的富农，比地主土地为多，有的甚至占到全部土地的百分之二十以上。
    乙、中南区农村的富农，有许多是出租土地的。据河南十三个县三十二个村的调查，在四百二十二户富农中，出租土地的达一百四十一户，占总户数的百分之三十三，出租土地占其土地总数的百分之三十五。据湖南长沙等三个县十五个保的调查，富农户数共计二百五十六户，其中有百分之四十八的户出租土地，出租土地占其全部土地的百分之四十二。江西上犹黄沙乡富农的封建性更为浓厚，二十八户富农，共有土地一九七九·八亩，仅自耕一千零一亩，雇长工十五个，其余则全部出租，二十八户中仅只有一户没有出租，放高利贷者则有十八户，地租与高利贷的剥削收入差不多要占其全部剥削收入的三分之二，其中出租土地超过其自耕及雇人耕种之土地者，有十户，即所谓半地主式的富农。
    丙、富农一般占有较好的生产资料。根据对长沙明望乡、黎托乡、秋塘乡及湘阴县和丰乡，邵阳县震中乡等五个乡的调查，富农皆占有全部耕畜的百分之二十左右，其他如水车、犁、耙等农具亦较齐全。
    根据以上调查、分析，土地改革法对富农政策的规定是完全适合中南地区情况的。总的来说，保存富农经济，保护富农自耕与雇工经营部分的土地及保留小量出租土地，对于孤立地主阶级，团结中农，稳定生产情绪是有重大意义的。而且在一般地区，不动富农土地，只没收征收地主及公田分配给无地少地农民，亦可以大体解决贫雇农的土地问题，每人大约可得到全村平均数的百分之七十到八十左右的土地，如再加人民政府积极对生产的领导扶助，及农民自己积极经营，即可以求得初步生活改善，并能增加一部分扩大再生产的能力，而进一步发展农业生产。但是另一方面，也确有一部分地区如河南北部中部、及江西老苏区、湖南南部、湖北沿江地带，土地比较分散，富农占有土地很多（约占全部土地百分之十五到二十），而且大量出租土地，这样的地区如果不征收富农出租土地一部，则贫雇农所得到的土地就太少了。根据上列各典型村调查，有的（如湖北武昌黄土坡等村）则只能得到相当于全村平均数的百分之五十，甚至还少于百分之五十，这样就使广大贫苦农民连最低限度的生活也不能维持。因此在这种地区，经过省人民政府以上的机关批准，征收富农出租土地之一部或全部是完全正确的。
    其次，对所谓半地主式的富农土地的出租部分加以征收，分给贫苦农民，对发展生产是极为有利的。因为他们出租大量土地，他们自己已过着半寄生虫的生活，如果保留下来对生产是没有任何好处的。因之在上述二种情况下，征收富农出租之大量土地一部或全部，是和保存富农经济，以利于恢复发展农业生产的目的，完全一致的。
    三、小土地出租者
    根据湖北黄陂新义村、石桥村、武昌黄土坡村等三村调查，乡村中普遍皆有一部分手工工人、小贩、医生、教员及个别的残废、孤、寡、老弱者，占有一部较一般农民为多的土地并出租。他们占有土地平均不到当地每人平均数的二倍，一般说生活并不特别富裕。而且他们本来多是劳动者，其土地来源也多是劳动得来的，现在我国对这些人还没有社会保险，他们一旦失去土地，则无法生活；况且这些人数不多，所占土地比重不大（一般在百分之三到五），而对农村生产不利影响也小，因之土地改革法第五条之规定，是极为必要的。河南土改的经验证明，这一政策颇为广大人民所满意与同情。这样贫农虽然少分得一点土地（每人相差只几厘地），但可取得更广泛的社会同情；并有助于稳定社会秩序。
    四、巩固团结中农问题
    中农在新解放区农村中，没有像华北老区那样大的比重，他们占有的土地也没有像老解放区中农那样多。在湘、鄂、赣等省，中农一般约占人口的百分之三十，土地的百分之三十稍多一点；在广东有些地区则更少，有的只占到人口的百分之十几。因此在中南区农村中，中农因为自己地少，兼租地主、富农一部土地者很多。黄陂县新义村的一一九户中农中，即有三八户兼租土地一部。其他各地通常也都要有三分之一的中农兼为佃户。因之在今春减租中，中农都积极参加运动，参加农民协会。土地改革法又规定了保护中农财产与一般不动富农财产，这必然更加有助于对中农生产情绪的稳定与政治上的团结。但除此之外，还要注意在分配土地时，必须按照土地改革法第十二条的规定，在抽出地主土地分配时，对原耕农民加以适当照顾，这无论对恢复与发展生产以及巩固对中农的团结上，都是极为重要的。
    五、贫雇农及其他劳动人民
    从前述材料中可以看出，中南区各省农村中的贫农及雇农普遍要占总户数的百分之五十以上，占总人口的百分之五十以上（雇农约占总户数的百分之十，人口的百分之八，占土地的千分之五），而只占有土地的百分之十五左右。湖南益阳箴言乡十六保总户数是一、二○三户，雇贫农即占七八一户，为总户数的百分之六十五（如连手工工人等劳动人民计算在内，即有八八二户），占有土地则一般只有全村平均数的五分之一，而丝毫没有土地的赤贫就有二五九户。这些贫农的生活，只靠耕种自己的土地是没法维持的，所以十分之七八的贫农要租种地主田地或借用地主高利贷。他们终日辛勤劳动，但一年所得的大部却被地主剥夺而去，不够吃、没得穿。因而有许多农民连自己仅有的一点自耕地，也全被地主剥夺了去，不得不去当雇工，甚至逼得流浪各地去谋求生活。
    雇农的数量在江南地区数量也较大，通常约占总户数的百分之十左右，而他们占有的土地却不到土地总数的百分之一，就是说，十户有八九户就根本没有土地。雇工工资也是很低的。湖南长沙榔梨乡十保共五十八个雇工，其中工资最高的只一个，一年才二十六石谷，有三十四个是十石到二十石谷，有十二个是五、六石谷，有十一个（内有女工二个）却只三、四石谷。雇主除给雇工吃饭外，其余一概不管，有病雇主不但不给医治，病间误工还要扣除工资。江西丰城二区丁村雇工工资原来一年就只十五石谷，今年反而减低到七石。而且不少地区许多雇工已被解雇，因之他们的生活就更加困苦。
    此外乡村的手工业工人、小贩、自由职业者等劳动人民在南方农村中亦较多，湘、粤等省约占总户口、人口的百分之十左右，鄂、赣稍差，约占百分之五，豫省最少，约占百分之一、二，在城市近郊农村中，个别地方有的占到百分之二十左右。他们占有的土地一般很少，大多只占全部土地的百分之一、二。在解放前后，因为城乡关系未趋正常，及某些手工业产品的销路减少，有一部分人生活亦感困难，他们希望在土改中能分到一部分土地，这是土改中应该注意的问题。
    综合起来看，贫农、雇农、及手工工人、小贩等，就要占农村人口的百分之六十到百分之七十以上，只占有土地百分之十到百分之十五，尤其在湘、粤两省，完全没有土地的赤贫农即占总户数的百分之十五以上，甚至到百分之二、三十；所以中南全区八千万以上的广大雇贫农，就最为迫切要求迅速实行土地改革，以分得一份相当数量的土地，以利恢复与发展生产。土改之所以必须依靠雇贫农团结中农的道理也就在此。
