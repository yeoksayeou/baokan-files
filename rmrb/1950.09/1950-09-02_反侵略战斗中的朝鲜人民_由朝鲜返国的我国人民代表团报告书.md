Xinhua News Agency, September 1st: The Chinese People's Delegation, which recently returned from Korea, had its deputy head, Li Lisan, read the delegation's report on the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing, reporting to the people of the whole country on the heroic anti-aggression war waged by the Korean people. The report is titled "The Korean People in the Anti-Aggression Struggle," and the full text is as follows:

    The Chinese People's Anti-American Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Movement Committee decided to send a people's delegation to visit Korea, celebrate the fifth anniversary of the "August 15th" liberation of the Korean people, and express sympathy to the heroic Korean people and the People's Army, and at the same time express gratitude for the Korean people's past contributions to the Chinese revolution.
    After repeated consultations and individual selections, a delegation consisting of twenty-one representatives from various people's organizations, democratic parties, and the People's Liberation Army, and two secretaries, was formed. On August 7th, an inaugural meeting was held at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and Guo Moruo was elected as the head of the delegation, and Li Lisan as the deputy head.
    The delegation departed from Beijing on the evening of the 11th, entered the Korean border at Sinuiju on the evening of the 13th, and arrived in Pyongyang on the evening of the 14th. On the 15th, they visited the bombed areas of Pyongyang, visited the American prisoner-of-war camp, and participated in the "August 15th" fifth anniversary celebration. On the 16th, they visited two wounded soldier hospitals to express sympathy. On the evening of the 17th, Li Lisan and five others departed for Seoul, and Zhang Naiqi and seven others departed for Wonsan. Both arrived at their destinations on the morning of the 18th. The Seoul team visited the bombed Yongsan industrial area and the Han River Railway Bridge, and went to the wounded soldier hospital to express sympathy. The Wonsan team visited the bombed area and visited Tari Village, Anbyon County (Prefecture). Both teams returned to Pyongyang on the evening of the 20th. Guo Moruo and eight others stayed in Pyongyang and visited Kim Il-sung University, the Revolutionary Martyrs' School, the National Film Studio, and the grain processing factory, and visited the hometown of General Kim Il-sung. On the evening of the 21st, the entire delegation participated in the farewell banquet hosted by Chairman Kim Tu-bong, departed on the evening of the 22nd, arrived in Andong on the morning of the 23rd, and returned to Beijing on the evening of the 24th.
    We were received with unparalleled enthusiasm and cordiality by the Korean government and the Korean people in various parts of Korea. We listened to many reports. Our Korean friends provided us with various assistance and all conveniences so that we could successfully complete our mission. We must express our heartfelt thanks here.

            I. The Korean People Tempered into Steel
    Korea is a heroic nation with a long history, having repelled foreign invasions four times in its three thousand years of existence. The Japanese imperialists enslaved Korea for thirty-six years, but not only failed to subdue the Korean people, but instead tempered them even more strongly. The armed anti-Japanese struggle continued to grow, and a large number of revolutionary cadres emerged from it, becoming the leadership center today. The anti-Japanese struggle made the people of China and Korea more closely united. The Chinese Revolution of 1926-27, the subsequent land revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation, each revolutionary battle had Korean comrades participating. The number was greater each time. They learned the combination of internationalism and patriotism very early, and paid the price of blood and flesh.
    The tempering after the "August 15th" liberation is even stricter and more precious for the entire Korean people. The "38th Parallel" has become a watershed between two worlds. In less than five years, the American imperialist lackey, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, under the instigation of the American imperialists, crossed the 38th Parallel and armed invaded North Korea more than a thousand times. The peace-loving North Korean people, for the independence and unification of their country, for the safety of their lives and property and their wives and children, had to arm themselves in self-defense. Therefore, on "June 25th," in this last intolerable encroachment by Lee's bandits, they had no choice but to pursue and annihilate them after repelling the enemy, in order to strive for lasting peace and to rescue the brothers and sisters in the southern half who were in dire straits. This situation is roughly the same as the process in China during the War of Liberation, where the people went from being forced to fight to launching a counter-offensive and finally achieving complete victory. The American imperialist lackey, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, was the provocateur of the Chinese civil war, and the American imperialist lackey, the Lee Seung-man bandit gang, was the provocateur of the Korean civil war. Although the American imperialists have wantonly put the hat of "aggression" on the heads of the Korean people, this is precisely the fascist trick of "the thief crying 'catch the thief.'"

            II. The Korean People Do Not Want War, But Must Resist Aggression
    The Korean people, like the rising sun, unanimously demand peace. However, demanding peace inevitably requires resisting the destroyers of peace. The North Korean people are working hard on peaceful construction, and have already achieved brilliant successes. Every Korean friend, when talking about national plans and their own production plans, appears excited and animated, because construction has given them happiness and hope. Any country that is people-oriented and actively engaged in construction needs peace, and needs lasting peace. Such a country, wholeheartedly dedicated to construction, will never suspend its plans to provoke war, but will never want its hard work to be destroyed.
    Thanks to the correct leadership of General Kim Il-sung and the brotherly help of the Soviet Union, North Korea has overfulfilled the two one-year national plans for 1947 and 1948, and is victoriously carrying out the two-year national plan for 1949-50. Industrial production in 1949 has increased to 371.1 percent of 1946, and in the first half of 1950 it increased to 167.9 percent of the first half of 1949, reaching four and a half times the production level of 1946. It is also more than 17.5 percent higher than 1944, the peak year of the Japanese imperialist rule. The proportions among various industries have also been roughly adjusted and balanced, completely eliminating the dependence and subordination of colonial production, and achieving independence in production and technology.
    The railway transportation capacity in the first half of 1950 has increased to six and a half times that of the first half of 1946. The volume of commodity circulation in the same period increased to 12.4 times that of the entire year of 1946. Workers' wages have increased by 80 percent compared to 1946, while prices have fallen by half. Therefore, the lives of workers have been greatly improved.
    The achievements in agricultural production are also enormous. Although there was a drought in 1949, the grain harvest was still 20.9 percent higher than in 1944, the peak year of Japanese imperialist rule. North Korea, which used to be short of food, has become surplus. This year the rainfall is moderate, and the harvest will be greatly increased compared to last year.
    The progress in agriculture is mainly due to the completion of land reform. Nearly one million chongbo (one chongbo equals more than 15 mu) of farmland was distributed to farmers free of charge, and only landlords, who accounted for 4 percent of the population, were hit. Before liberation, farmers had to hand over more than 70 percent of their agricultural products to landlords and Japanese imperialists, but now they only have to bear 23 to 27 percent of the agricultural tax. This has greatly improved the farmers' production enthusiasm. The average grain yield per chongbo of paddy field has increased from three and a half tons before liberation to five tons. Li Huashi, an agricultural model in Gangwon Province, created a record of harvesting 13.15 metric tons of rice per chongbo last year. Park Kyung-saeng, an agricultural model in the same province, is preparing to break this record with 15 tons this year. This record should be a great encouragement to China's agricultural production.
    The progress in cultural and educational construction is equally astonishing. Illiteracy was basically eliminated in 1949. The number of primary schools has increased 18 times compared to 1944, the peak year of Japanese imperialist rule, middle schools have increased 20 times, various specialized schools have increased 12 times, and the number of universities has increased from none to 15 today. Cultural and recreational facilities have also been greatly increased. Korea has produced its own orchestra and opera, and is able to manufacture its own films and records. With the encouragement of the state, a large number of talented artists are emerging, adding brilliance and vitality to the new country.

            III. Great Unity and Strong Organizational Power
    Under the leadership of General Kim Il-sung, although the Korean people's economic and cultural construction is limited to North Korea, its political influence has long spread throughout the country.
    Korea established a unanimous central people's government two years ago. The Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was elected simultaneously from North and South Korea on August 15, 1948, using universal suffrage. North Korea adopted direct elections, and 99.97 percent of voters cast their ballots. South Korea, due to the brutal oppression of the American and Lee, adopted indirect elections. The preliminary election was conducted underground, and the number of voters reached 77.52 percent of the electorate. Of the 572 seats, South Korea accounted for 360 seats, and North Korea accounted for 212 seats. The deputies include representatives from various revolutionary classes and various democratic parties and groups, symbolizing the great unity of the patriotic and democratic forces of the whole country.
    In June 1949, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, 71 political parties and organizations from North and South Korea formed the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland. The scale of the lineup and the breadth of representation were unprecedented. This united front has repeatedly put forward plans for peaceful unification, but they have all been rejected by the Lee Seung-man bandit gang.
    What is strikingly expressed is the organizational power of the Korean people. The Workers' Party, which leads the Korean revolution, has about 1.8 million members. The General Federation of Trade Unions of North Korea (i.e., the All-China Federation of Trade Unions) has 540,000 members, organizing slightly less than 82 percent of all 660,000 employees. The Democratic Youth League of North Korea (Mingeon) has 1.3 million members. The Democratic Women's League of North Korea has 1.5 million members. Although South Korea is under the crazy oppression of the American and Lee, the National Council of Trade Unions has also developed to 300,000 members, Mingeon 1.2 million, and the Democratic Women's League 1.3 million. It is indeed rare and valuable for Korea with a population of 30 million to have such a large number of organized people.
    We contacted many representatives of political parties and organizations, and they unanimously expressed their great determination to oppose American aggression to the end. They showed a high degree of harmony and cooperation with each other. The leadership of the Workers' Party and General Kim Il-sung won unanimous praise and support with heartfelt conviction.

            IV. The Heinous Rule of the American and Lee
    The rule of the American and Lee in South Korea is unparalleled cruel—far exceeding the rule of Japan. In less than five years, American imperialist capital has seized 91.23 percent of the total industrial capital of South Korea, monopolized foreign trade, and created huge import surpluses. Under the manipulation, oppression, and massive dumping of American goods by American capitalists, most of the factories and mines have shut down, and 1.5 million people have lost their jobs. The harassment of the military police, the heavy burden of taxes, and the compulsory purchase of grain have forced farmers to abandon farming. The area of cultivated land has decreased by 55 percent compared to before liberation, and the harvest has decreased by five million stones. Under MacArthur's instructions, Lee's bandit gang requisitioned 200,000 tons of grain this year and transported it to Japan, causing South Korea, which was once famous for its abundant grain production, to become short of grain, and many people had to endure hunger.
    Lee's bandit gang's intelligence organization accommodates American, Japanese, and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang special agents, bringing together the culmination of brutality and bloodlust. In less than five years, it has arrested, detained, and slaughtered hundreds of thousands of people. By 1949, the number of people arrested had reached more than 400,000. In Jeju Island alone, more than 37,000 people were killed. Twelve well-known right-wing parliamentarians were also persecuted and massacred. On the eve of the defeat, their slaughter was even more frantic. A killing field near Daejeon slaughtered more than 7,000 people.
    Under the dark rule of the American and Lee, the Korean people unanimously believe that Pyongyang is the holy land of national liberation, and General Kim Il-sung is a symbol of light.
    The Korean people, who have lived a miserable life of slavery for thirty-six years, once they have been liberated, established their own government, managed their own industries, distributed their own land, and earned a human life through their own hard work, will never give up the revolutionary fruits they have obtained and go back to living a life of slavery. Every worker, farmer, youth, woman, and even child we contacted can tell this truth, so everyone is willing to risk their lives to resist American imperialist aggression.

            V. "Everything for the Front! Everything for Victory!"
    "Everything for the Front! Everything for Victory!" This is General Kim Il-sung's call, and the heroic and skillful fighting of the People's Army has made the sound of this call even louder. Since the outbreak of the war, in just one and a half months, 90 percent of the territory of South Korea and 92 percent of the population have been liberated. This victory is indeed very brilliant.
    American news agencies have constantly put forward the four words "infiltration tactics." This is indeed a tactic that the American army "changes color at the mention of a tiger" and is commonly used by the People's Army. The People's Army fully understands that the American army relies only on airplanes and artillery. Once they rush past the enemy's artillery range and enter a situation where they are intertwined with the enemy, making it impossible for American planes to bomb, it will be a "no man's land." The American army only needs to face the People's Army, either fleeing or surrendering. Bayonets and grenades are the two weapons that the American army fears the most.
    The heroic deeds of the People's Army are countless and endless. Naval hero Kim Ki-wo led four torpedo boats and sank an American 10,000-ton cruiser. Air Force hero Li Dong-gyu shot down nine enemy planes, Kim Gi-ok shot down ten, and anti-aircraft gunner Hong Min-guk shot down thirteen. In terms of the morale of the wounded soldiers, we visited several wounded soldiers, and everyone said that they hoped to heal their wounds as soon as possible and return to the front line to kill the enemy.
    In the eyes of the Korean people, the People's Army has become a top-notch glorious title. Therefore, under the call of General Kim Il-sung, more than 800,000 people in North Korea and more than 400,000 people in South Korea have applied to join the army. The number of people applying to join the army far exceeds the needs of troop replenishment, and the government has to patiently persuade them to stay in their original jobs and work hard.
    The Democratic Youth League played a great role in the mobilization to join the army. Almost all students above the high school level have joined the army, and the enthusiasm of women to join the army is also unprecedented. Among the 568,000 men and 281,000 women who applied to join the army in North Korea, except for 50,000, the rest are all members of the Democratic Youth League. Among the 130,000 people who applied to join the army in Gangwon Province, women accounted for more than 60,000. In addition to serving in the army, women also armed themselves to participate in guerrillas and garrison teams. In Seoul, more than 220,000 women participated in the repair team.
    The working class, which leads the Korean revolution, has achieved particularly outstanding results in the war. Some workers formed military industrial teams and took on the task of restoring transportation. The Han River Railway Bridge was bombed more than 50 times and repaired more than 50 times. Telecommunications lines in various places were quickly repaired as soon as they were bombed. This repair work is often carried out in the face of enemy bombing and strafing, and the task is as arduous as fighting on the front line.
    The workers on the production front are also carrying out the same heroic struggle. "What am I contributing to the anti-aggression war?" is a slogan that every worker sticks in front of them. They launched the "double-up movement" to produce double the products to respond to the enemy's destruction. Many factories have completed 200 to 300 percent of their quotas. Model young worker Sun Changmo has already completed 500 percent of his quota.
    Technical improvements have also created new records. A machine that used to require ten people to transport only requires two people to transport after the workers' collective research and modification, and the transport rate has increased to 600 percent of the past.
    Due to the requests of the working masses, the government promulgated a decree to increase working hours from eight hours to twelve hours and abolish holidays. Workers donated their processing wages to the state and launched the "donate airplanes and tanks movement."
    In order to make up for the lack of railway and automobile transportation, thousands of farmers organized human transportation teams, risking the danger of enemy bombing and strafing, to send military supplies to the front and food to the cities. Women and teenagers participated in this great work.
    Cultural workers are also working extremely hard during the war. Slogans and cartoons are posted in every corner of the countryside, and many are handwritten. They have mobilized to go to the front to serve the soldiers. Several well-known scholars, writers, and actors have been wounded or killed in battle on the front line.

            VI. The Atrocities of the American Army
    During our stay in Pyongyang, enemy planes bombed every day. In the city of Pyongyang, the area around the Pyongyang Railway Station was the most severely bombed. This used to be a prosperous area. In addition to shops and residences, there were also cultural institutions such as schools, newspapers, and bookstores, which have now all been bombed. When we went to visit the ruins, some people were still digging for their belongings in the ruins. A refugee family of five lost three members in the bombing. When asked what he thought, he resolutely said: "Only by driving the American army into the sea."
    Seoul was bombed more than 800 times, destroying more than 1,500 houses, 24 factories, one hospital, and one school. More than 2,500 civilians were killed and more than 5,000 were injured. The people of Seoul responded to the enemy's indiscriminate bombing with combat, and the number of applicants to join the army exceeded 100,000.
    Wonsan was bombed more than 170 times, destroying more than 1,300 houses, 142 factories, and the Red Cross hospital was also destroyed. More than 1,200 civilians were killed and more than 3,000 were injured. The citizens gradually accumulated air defense experience, and the number of casualties gradually decreased.
    Many religious people lived around a Catholic church in a certain place. They thought they were protected by the cross on the roof and did not need to take shelter. As a result, the church and the surrounding houses were all bombed, and many people were killed and injured.
    Such indiscriminate bombing of peaceful cities in the rear aroused our common anger. The atrocities of American planes in Korea are even worse than the atrocities of Japanese planes in China. Considering that the American representative Austin is pretending to be "just" and "peaceful" in Chenggong Lake, one cannot help but say that he is "shameless"!

            VII. The Life and Expressions of American Prisoners
    The most brutal people in the world are often the most cowardly people. This is the feeling we had after visiting the American prisoner-of-war camp. The prisoner-of-war camp is a tall Western-style building. The prisoners eat two meals of bread and one meal of rice a day. There is meat and cigarettes. Several prisoners still have watches on their wrists. Presumably, what they lack is only a safety razor, and they are not able to shave every day, which makes them look not beautiful enough. Four prisoners were sitting face to face, playing bridge. One had a violin beside him, which the administrator had prepared for him. The generous prisoner policy made them understand that the American and Lee's anti-propaganda is false. Preliminary political education seems to have given them some awareness. Therefore, they are willing to take the initiative to broadcast and even march.
    In this prisoner-of-war camp, there are 338 prisoners, all of whom are Americans, but including twenty-one different nationalities. When asked why they joined the army, they all replied "to get money." When asked why they attacked Korea, most answered "don't know," one answered "ask Truman," and another answered "originally just wanted to visit Korea."
    One of them is an air force prisoner of war. Logically, he should be hated by everyone in the Korean people, but he is also treated generously. At first, he flatly denied that American planes would bomb non-military targets. The administrator accompanied him to visit a bombed area in Pyongyang once, and he lowered his head in silence.
    On one occasion, enemy planes deliberately strafed American prisoners who were being escorted. It flew so low that the faces of pedestrians on the ground could be seen. The American prisoners raised their hands to express their intentions, but the strafing started immediately. As a result, three of the five American prisoners died, but the escorting Korean soldiers were unharmed. The two surviving American prisoners reported to their companions, which caused a great stir. The administrator wanted to paint the English words "American Prisoners" on the roof, but was met with unanimous opposition from the prisoners. They probably already fully understand that it is not the Korean people who are killing American prisoners, but the American imperialists themselves.

            VIII. Learn from Korea! Support Korea!
    The victory of the Korean people is not accidental. Under the wise and correct leadership of General Kim Il-sung, and with the selfless help of the Soviet Union, five years of national construction and the improvement of people's lives should become the material basis for victory. The ideological preparation for completing this foundation is undoubtedly the long-term oppression of Japanese imperialism and the unparalleled brutality of the American and Lee, which have made the Korean people better at combining internationalism and patriotism, becoming extremely sharp weapons for revolutionary struggle and national construction.
    Chairman Mao told us: American imperialism is a paper tiger that looks strong but is actually weak. The victory of the Chinese people punctured one side of the paper tiger—indirect interference. American imperialism can no longer foster a puppet regime as large as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and equip an anti-people armed force as large as the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang anywhere in the world today.
    The victory of the Korean people has punctured the other side of the paper tiger—direct interference. Korea with a population of 30 million can defeat the armed aggression of American imperialism, and it will never want to find any cheapness in the war of aggression.
    The victory of the Korean people has given American imperialism a serious lesson: the power of the people cannot be insulted. This is a great contribution to world peace. The people of the world should thank the Korean people. At the same time, the Chinese people who have been invaded by American imperialism should thank the Korean people even more—they have gloriously fought a victorious outpost battle for us.
    However, American imperialism has always been unwilling to accept historical lessons, and more cruel battles may still be behind. Just for ourselves, the American troops that invaded Taiwan are still to be driven out. On August 27th, the fourth day after we returned to Beijing, American planes unscrupulously invaded our Northeast airspace on the Yalu River, harming our people and property. Isn't this a warning sign for us?
    We Chinese people and the people of the world must be more vigilant, learn from the Korean people, learn their high degree of organization and discipline, and learn their unparalleled heroism. The Korean people are prepared to cope with the more frantic attacks of American imperialism. They have the determination: in order to drive away American imperialism, they must prepare to fight to the last drop of blood. Today, supporting Korea is defending peace. All the Chinese people and the people of the world must recognize this point, and must work hard to support the Korean people's just war, give the invaders a more tragic counterattack, and strive for the final victory as soon as possible!
    The Korean people's renewed efforts, the close unity of the Chinese and Korean people, and the unanimous support of the world's peace and democracy camp "will surely bury the war instigators of the heinous American imperialism in the raging fire of the great national independence struggle!"

　　反侵略战斗中的朝鲜人民
    由朝鲜返国的我国人民代表团报告书
    【新华社一日讯】日前由朝鲜回国的中国人民代表团副团长李立三代表该团在北京中央人民广播电台宣读该团的报告书，向全国人民报告朝鲜人民英勇进行反侵略战争的情形。报告书题为《反侵略战斗中的朝鲜人民》，全文如下：
    中国人民反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动委员会决定派遣人民代表团访问朝鲜，庆祝“八·一五”朝鲜人民解放五周年纪念，慰劳英勇作战的朝鲜人民和人民军，同时对于朝鲜人民过去帮助中国革命的功劳表示感谢。
    经过反复的协商和各别的推选，包括各人民团体、各民主党派和人民解放军的代表二十一人，秘书二人所组成的代表团产生了。八月七日在中华全国总工会开了成立会，推选郭沫若为团长，李立三为副团长。
    代表团于十一日晚由北京出发，十三日晚进入朝鲜国境新义州，十四日晚到达平壤。十五日参观了平壤被炸区，访问了美军俘虏营，参加了“八·一五”解放五周年庆祝大会。十六日到两处伤兵医院慰问。十七日晚李立三等六人出发汉城，章乃器等八人出发元山。均于十八日晨到达目的地。汉城队参观了被炸的龙山工业区和汉江铁桥，并赴伤兵医院慰问。元山队参观了被炸地区，访问了安边郡（县）塔里（村）。两队均于二十日晚回到平壤。郭沫若等九人留在平壤，参观了金日成大学、革命遗族学校、国家电影制片厂和谷产加工工厂，并访问了金日成将军的故乡。二十一日晚全体参加了金枓奉委员长的送别欢宴，二十二日晚动身，二十三日晨到达安东，二十四日晚返抵北京。
    我们在朝鲜各地受到朝鲜政府和朝鲜人民无比热烈的欢迎和无比亲切的招待，听取了多次的报告，朝鲜友人们给与我们以种种协助和一切的便利，使我们能够圆满地达成任务。我们须在此表示衷心的感谢。
            一、锻炼成钢的朝鲜人民
    朝鲜是一个历史悠久的英雄民族，立国三千余年，曾经四次击退了外来的大军侵犯。日帝奴役朝鲜三十六年，不但没有能够使朝鲜人民屈服，反而把他们锻炼的更加坚强。武装反日斗争不断的增长着，从那中间涌现出来大批的革命干部，成为今天的领导中心。反日斗争使得中朝两国人民更加密切地团结在一起。中国一九二六——二七年的大革命，其后的土地革命，抗日战争和解放战争，每一革命战役都有朝鲜同志参加。人数是一次比一次多。他们很早就学会了国际主义与爱国主义的结合，付出了血肉的代价。
    “八·一五”解放以后的锻炼对于整个朝鲜人民是更加严格而又更加珍贵的。“三八线”成为两个世界的分水岭。不满五年之间，美帝走狗李承晚匪帮在美帝的策动之下越过三八线武装侵犯北朝鲜达一千数百次。爱好和平的北朝鲜人民为了祖国的独立和统一，为了自己的生命财产和妻儿子女的安全，不能不武装自卫了。因而在“六·二五”，在这忍无可忍的最后一次李匪的进犯，不能不在击退了敌人之后，予以追击歼灭，以争取持久的和平，并解救南半部在水深火热中的兄弟姊妹。这种情形，与中国在解放战争当中人民由被迫作战转入反攻而终于取得全胜的经过大致相同。美帝走狗蒋介石匪帮是中国内战的挑衅者，美帝走狗李承晚匪帮是朝鲜内战的挑衅者。尽管美帝把“侵略”的帽子横加在朝鲜人民的头上，这正是法西斯的惯技，“贼喊捉贼”而已。
            二、朝鲜人民不愿意战争，但必须反抗侵略
    有如旭日东升的朝鲜人民是一致要求和平的。然而，要求和平就不可免的要反抗和平的破坏者。北朝鲜人民正在努力进行和平的建设，而且已经获得了光辉的成就。每一位朝鲜朋友谈到国家计划和自己的生产计划都显得兴高彩烈，眉飞色舞，因为建设已经给予了他们以幸福和希望。凡以人民为本，积极从事于建设的国家都需要和平，而且需要持久的和平。这样的国家，专心致志于建设工作，决不会中止自己的计划去挑拨战争，但也决不愿自己的惨澹经营遭受到破坏。
    由于金日成将军的正确领导和苏联友邦兄弟般的帮助，朝鲜北半部已经超额完成了一九四七年和一九四八年两次的一年国家计划，而且正在胜利地进行一九四九——五○年的两年国家计划。一九四九年的工业生产已经增加到一九四六年的百分之三七一·一，一九五○年上半年又增加到一九四九年上半年的百分之一六七·九，达到一九四六年生产水平的四倍半。比起日帝统治时代的一九四四年也超过了百分之十七·五。各种产业之间的比重也大致调整就绪，达到了平衡，完全扫除了殖民地生产的依赖性和从属性，取得了生产上和技术上的独立。
    一九五○年上半年的铁路运输力，已经增加到一九四六年上半年的六倍半。同一时期的商品流通量增加到一九四六年全年的十二倍·四。工人工资比一九四六年增加了百分之八十，而物价则已跌落了一半。因此，工人生活已经大大地改善了。
    农业生产上的成就也是巨大的。一九四九年虽然遭遇到旱灾，谷物收获量仍比日帝统治时代的一九四四年增加了百分之二○·九。一向粮食不足的北朝鲜变成有余粮了。今年雨水调匀，收成要比去年大大地增加。
    农业上的进步主要由于土地改革的完成。将近一百万町步（每町步合十五亩余）的农田无偿地分配给农民，遭受打击的只限于占户口百分之四的地主。解放前农民要把农产的百分之七十以上交给地主和日帝，现在就只须负担百分之二三至二七的农业税了。这样就大大地提高了农民的生产情绪，每町步水田的平均谷物产量已经由解放前的三吨半提高到五吨了。江原道农业模范李华石去年已经创造了每町步收获稻谷十三公吨一五○公斤的纪录，同一道的农业模范朴庆生今年更准备以十五吨的数字打破这个纪录。这种纪录对于中国的农业生产应该是有很大的鼓励作用的。
    文教建设的进步同样惊人。文盲在一九四九年就已经基本扫除。小学比日帝统治时代一九四四年增加了十八倍，中学增加了二十倍，各种专门学校增加了十二倍，大学由完全没有到了今天的十五所。文化娱乐的设备也大大地增加，已经产生了自己的管弦乐队和歌舞剧，能够自己制造影片和唱片了。在国家的鼓励下，大批的天才艺术工作者正涌现出来，为新国家增加了光彩和活力。
            三、伟大的团结和强大的组织力
    在金日成将军领导下朝鲜人民的经济、文化建设虽然只限于北朝鲜，但政治影响却早已遍及全国。
    朝鲜已经在两年以前成立了举国一致的中央人民政权。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议是在一九四八年八月十五日用普选方法同时从南北朝鲜选举出来的。北朝鲜采用直接选举，百分之九九·九七的选民投了票。南朝鲜由于美李的残暴压迫，采用间接选举。初选是在地下进行的，投票人数也达到选民的百分之七七·五二。在五七二议席中，南朝鲜占三六○席，北朝鲜占二一二席。议员包括各革命阶级和各民主政党、社团的代表，象征着全国爱国民主势力的大团结。
    一九四九年六月又在劳动党的领导下，南北朝鲜七十一个政党和社团组成了祖国统一民主主义战线，阵容的壮阔和代表性的广泛是前所未有的。这一统一战线曾一再提出了和平统一的方案，都遭受到李承晚匪帮的拒绝。
    有惊人表现的是朝鲜人民的组织力。领导朝鲜革命的劳动党拥有党员约一百八十万人。北朝鲜职业总同盟（即总工会）有盟员五十四万人，组织了全部职工六十六万人的百分之八十二弱。北朝鲜民主青年同盟（民青）有盟员一百三十万人。北朝鲜民主女性同盟有盟员一百五十万人。南朝鲜虽然在美李的疯狂压迫之下，劳动组合全国评议委员会也曾经发展到盟员三十万人，民青一百二十万人，民主女性同盟一百三十万人。三千万人口的朝鲜能有如此巨大数目的有组织人民，的确是难能可贵的事。
    我们接触了许多政党和社团的代表人物，他们一致地表示反对美国侵略到底的重大决心，他们相互之间表现了高度的和谐与合作。劳动党和金日成将军的领导博得了心悦诚服的一致的赞扬与拥护。
            四、穷凶极恶的美李统治
    美李在南朝鲜的统治无比残酷——远远地超过了日本的统治。在不满五年的时间内，美帝资本已经攫夺了南朝鲜产业总资本额的百分之九一·二三，独占了对外贸易，造成了巨额的入超。在美国大资本家的操纵、压迫和美货大量倾销之下，大部分的厂矿停顿了，一百五十万人失了业。军警的骚扰、捐税的苛重和粮食的强制收购，使得农民只好放弃耕作。耕地面积比解放前减少了百分之五五，收获量减少了五百万石。在麦克阿瑟的指示下，李匪帮今年又征购了二十万吨的粮食运往日本，致使一向以粮产丰富出名的南朝鲜变成了粮食不够，许多人要忍受饥饿。
    李匪帮的特务组织容纳了美帝、日帝和蒋匪帮的特工人员，集残暴嗜杀的大成，在不满五年之间，逮捕拘禁、屠杀了数十万的人民。至一九四九年为止逮捕的人数达四十余万人。单在济州岛一处，便有三万七千多人被杀。十二名的著名右翼议员也遭受了迫害和屠杀。在溃败的前夕，他们的屠杀是更加疯狂了。大田附近一处的杀人场就屠杀了七千多人。
    在暗无天日的美李统治下，朝鲜人民不约而同的认为平壤是民族解放的圣地，金日成将军是光明的象征。
    过了三十六年悲惨的奴隶生活的朝鲜人民，一旦得到了解放，建立起来自己的政权，管理了自己的产业，分得了自己的土地，用自己的勤劳挣得了人的生活以后，再想要他们放弃已经获得的革命果实，重新去过奴隶般的生活，那是万万做不到的。我们所接触的工人、农民、青年、妇女以至儿童，每一个人都能说出这一番道理，因而每一个人都愿意拚性命反抗美帝的侵略。
            五、“一切为前线！一切为胜利！”
    “一切为前线！一切为胜利！”这是金日成将军的号召，人民军的英勇善战使得这一号召的声音更加响亮了。战争发动以来，在短短一个半月的时间当中，便解放南朝鲜领土百分之九十，人口百分之九十二，这一胜利的确是十分辉煌的。
    美国的通讯社曾经不断地提出“渗透战术”四个字。这的确是美军“谈虎色变”而又为人民军所惯用的战术。人民军完全明白美军所依靠的只是飞机大炮。冲过了敌人大炮射程，进入和敌军处于犬牙交错的形势，使得美机无从轰炸，那就到了“无人之境”了。美军只须面对人民军，不是逃跑便是投降。刺刀和手榴弹是美军最害怕的两样武器。
    人民军的英勇事迹是数不清，说不完的。海军英雄金基沃率领四艘鱼雷艇打沉了一艘美军万吨的巡洋舰。空军英雄李东奎打下了敌机九架，金矶玉打下了十架，高射炮手洪民国打下了十三架。更就伤兵的情绪来说，我们慰问了几处的伤兵，每个人都表示希望早日治愈创伤，重返前线杀敌。
    在朝鲜人民的心目中，人民军已经变成了头等光荣的称号。因此在金日成将军的号召之下，北朝鲜已经有八十多万人申请参军，南朝鲜也有四十多万人申请参军。申请参军的人数远远地超过了兵员补充的需要，政府还得耐心说服他们留在原工作岗位努力。
    在参军动员中，民青所起的作用是很大的，单只高中以上学生便几已全部参军，妇女参军的踊跃也是前所未有的。北朝鲜申请参军的，男子五六八、○○○人，和女子二八一、○○○人中，除五万人外其余均为民青盟员。江原道申请参军的十三万人当中，女性占六万多人。妇女除了担任军队中的服务以外，也有武装参加游击队和警备队的。在汉城，有二十二万多妇女参加修复队。
    领导朝鲜革命的工人阶级在战争中所表现的成绩尤其卓越。一部分工人编成了军工队，担任恢复交通的任务。汉江铁桥被炸断五十多次，修复五十多次。各地电讯线路一被炸断迅即修复。这种修复工作往往是冒着敌机的轰炸、扫射进行的，任务的艰巨一如前线作战。
    生产战线上的工人也在进行同样英勇的斗争。“我在反侵略战争中贡献些什么？”是每一个工人贴在自己前面的标语。他们发起了“倍加运动”，要生产加倍的产品来答复敌人的破坏。许多工厂都完成了定额的百分之二百至三百。模范青工孙昌模则已经完成定额的百分之五百。
    技术改进也创造了新纪录，一架过去需要十人转运的机器经过工人们的集体研究改装后，只需要两人转运，转运率反而提高到过去的百分之六百。
    由于工人群众的请求，政府颁布了法令，将工作时间由八小时加到十二小时，取消了休假日。工人们把加工工资捐献给国家，展开了“献飞机、坦克运动”。
    为着补救铁路、汽车运输之不足，千千万万的农民组织了人力运输队，冒着敌机轰炸、扫射的危险，送军用品到前方去，送食物到都市去。妇女和少年都参加了这一个伟大的工作。
    文化工作者在战时的工作也是异常努力的，每一个乡村的角落都张贴着标语和漫画，而且很多是手写的。他们纷纷动员到前方去为士兵服务，已有几位著名的学者、作家和演员，在前线负伤或阵亡了。
            六、美军的暴行
    我们在平壤的期间每天都有敌机空袭。在平壤市中，以平壤火车站周围受炸最烈。这儿本来是繁盛的区域，除了商店和住宅之外还有学校、报馆、书店等文化机关，现在已全部被炸毁了。当我们去访问废墟的时候，有些人仍在废址中发掘自己的物品。有一位难民一家五口，在轰炸中死了三口。问他作何感想，他很坚决地说：“只有把美国军赶下海去。”
    汉城被空袭八百多次，毁房屋一千五百多所、工厂二十四所、医院一所、学校一所。死亡平民二千五百多人，伤五千多人。汉城人民用战斗来答复敌机的滥炸，申请参军人数超过了十万人。
    元山被空袭一百七十多次，毁房屋一千三百多所、工厂一四二所，红十字会医院也被毁了。死亡平民一千二百多人，伤三千多人。市民逐渐积累了防空经验，死伤人数逐次减少了。
    某处天主教堂周围住着许多信教的人，他们自以为是有了屋顶上的十字架的保障而无须躲避。结果，教堂和周围的房屋全部炸毁，死伤了不少的人。
    这样对后方和平城市的滥肆轰炸使我们燃起了共同的忿怒。美机在朝鲜的暴行，比起日机在中国的暴行，真是有过之而无不及的。联想到成功湖上，美国代表奥斯汀正在满口“正义”“和平”的装腔作势，不能不说他是“恬不知耻”！
            七、美俘的生活和表示
    世间最残暴的人往往正是最怯懦的人，访问了美国俘虏营之后使得我们发生这样的感想。俘虏营是一所高大的洋楼，俘虏们每天吃两顿面包和一顿饭，有荤菜，而且有香烟。好几个俘虏的手腕上依然带着手表。大概他们所缺少的只是保安剃刀，没有能每天刮胡子，显得不够美丽而已。有俘虏四人对坐，在玩桥牌。有一位身边放着一只小提琴，据说是管理员为他准备的。宽大的俘虏政策使得他们明白：美李的反宣传是虚伪的。初步的政治教育似乎也使他们得到了一些觉悟。因此，他们才愿意自动去广播，以至游行。
    在这个俘虏营中，俘虏人数三三八名，都是美国人，但包括二十一种不同的民族。问他们为什么要当兵，一致回答“为着拿钱”。问他们为什么要进攻朝鲜，多数答称“不知道”，有一个人回答“去问杜鲁门”，另有一个人回答“本来只想到朝鲜游玩一番”。
    内中有一名是空军俘虏，依理应该是朝鲜人民人人痛恨的，但也同样受到宽大的待遇。他起初矢口否认美机会轰炸非军事目标，管理员陪同他去看一次平壤被轰炸区域，他才垂首无言了。
    敌机有一次还故意地扫射在押解中的美俘。它低飞到可以看见地面行人面目的距离，美俘举手表示意思，扫射却马上开始。结果五名美俘死了三名，押解的朝鲜士兵却无恙。两名生还的美俘向同伴们做了报告，引起了很大的激动。管理员曾想在屋顶漆上“美国俘虏”的英文大字，遭到俘虏们的全体反对。他们大概已经完全明白：残杀美俘的不是朝鲜人民，而正是美帝自己。
            八、学习朝鲜！声援朝鲜！
    朝鲜人民的胜利不是偶然的。在金日成将军英明正确的领导之下，在苏联大公无私的帮助之下，五年来的国家建设，人民生活的改善，应该成为胜利的物质基础。完成这一基础的思想准备，无疑的是日本帝国主义的长期压迫和美李的无比残暴，使得朝鲜人民更善于结合国际主义与爱国主义，成为了锐利无比的革命斗争和国家建设的武器。
    毛主席告诉我们：美帝是外强中干的一只纸老虎。中国人民的胜利戳穿了纸老虎的一面——间接干涉。美帝今天再也不可能在世界上的任何角落，扶植像蒋匪帮一样庞大的傀儡政权，装备像蒋匪帮一样庞大的反人民武装了。
    朝鲜人民的胜利又戳穿了纸老虎的另一方面——直接干涉。三千万人口的朝鲜都能打败美帝的武装侵略，它再也休想在侵略战争中找到什么便宜了。
    朝鲜人民的胜利给予了美帝一个严重的教训：人民力量是不可侮的。这对于世界和平是一个极大的贡献。全世界人民应该感谢朝鲜人民，同时，受到美帝侵略的中国人民更应该感谢朝鲜人民——他们已经很光荣地为我们打了胜利的前哨战。
    但是，美帝一向是不肯接受历史教训的，更残酷的战斗可能还在后面。单就我们自己来说，侵略我台湾的美军尚待驱逐，而在八月二十七日，我们回京后的第四天，鸭绿江边美机竟肆无忌惮地又侵犯我东北领空，伤害我人民财产，不是对于我们的一个警号吗？
    我们中国人民和全世界人民都必须更加警惕，并向朝鲜人民学习，学习他们高度的组织性与纪律性，学习他们无比的英勇气概。朝鲜人民是准备应付美帝更疯狂的进攻的。他们有决心：为要把美帝赶走，必须准备战到最后一滴血。在今天声援朝鲜就是保卫和平，全中国人民和全世界人民都必须认识到这一点，必须努力声援朝鲜人民的正义战争给予侵犯者以更惨重的回击，早日争取到最后的胜利！
    朝鲜人民的再接再厉，中朝两国人民的紧密团结，全世界和平民主阵营的一致声援，“必能把穷凶极恶的美国帝国主义的战争制造者，最后埋葬在伟大的民族独立斗争的怒火中”！
