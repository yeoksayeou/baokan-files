　　Typical Experiences of the Rural Peace Signature Campaign
    Zhuang Puming

    The Liuxia District of Hangzhou County, Zhejiang Province, initially launched the peace signature campaign in Liuxia Town, the district seat. This was in mid-June, when the rural areas were busy with planting rice seedlings. The district did not conduct in-depth publicity, and village cadres went to each household to mobilize signatures. As a result, men signed, but women did not, or only the head of each household signed. The workers in Liuxia Town were more active and organized a propaganda team, but they lacked leadership and their enthusiasm was low. They stopped after encountering setbacks. This caused many concerns and suspicions among the masses. Some believed that signing was a "sign-in," a "household registration check," a "distribution of grain," or perhaps "recruiting strong men for war," and so on.

    The district leadership summarized the reasons for the failure, believing that the main reasons were: it was not combined with the central work of the rural areas and was carried out in isolation; there was no sufficient publicity and education beforehand; and the role of various organizations and activists among the masses was not brought into play.

    At that time, the district was launching a large-scale pest control campaign. The district and township leaders accepted the lessons learned from the past and then planned to combine the peace signature campaign with the pest control campaign. First, they used various gatherings to educate the masses on the international situation and publicize the significance of the peace signature campaign; and organized 36 people including town workers, primary school teachers, Communist Youth League members, and women representatives to form a propaganda team. They not only publicized lighting lamps to control pests, but also conducted publicity for the peace signature campaign. On August 15th, every household in Liuxia Town lit lamps and everyone worked together to control pests. As soon as it got dark, the masses locked their doors and came to the fields to cool off under the lamps, play the huqin, sing operas, read newspapers, and chat. Vendors also came to peddle their wares. At this time, the propaganda team beat gongs and drums, led the masses to sing, and used loudspeakers to publicize to the masses gathered on the roads, using very simple and concrete materials to connect with the masses' thinking to explain why they should sign and what the use of signing was. Signature stations were set up on the roads and main road intersections. In the enthusiastic atmosphere, the masses scrambled to sign, and that night, 716 people signed.

    Wuchang Township accepted the experience of Liuxia Town. On August 17th and 18th, they briefly explained the significance of the peace signature campaign at the pest control mobilization meetings in each village, giving the masses a preliminary understanding. On the 19th, they mobilized more than 2,500 people throughout the township to collectively remove egg masses. Before the large team set off, village cadres called on everyone to go to the signature stations by the side of the road to sign when taking turns to rest. They also organized 15 Communist Youth League members and young activists to be responsible for the arrangement, publicity, and service of the signature stations. In this way, combined with the pest control movement, 85 percent of those who participated in pest control signed, accounting for 40 percent of the entire population of Wuchang Township.

    Liuxia Town's Fifth Village and Wuchang Township's Tenth Village, respectively, made use of egg collection mobilization meetings and farmers' association meetings, followed by village cadres, farmers' association committee members, activists, Communist Youth League members, and women representatives holding discussions, first further clarifying the significance of the peace signature campaign and discussing how to make the significance of the signature campaign known to every household and encourage everyone to sign consciously. The discussion resulted in a decision to use farmers' association committee members and group leaders as the core, with the assistance of Communist Youth League members and women representatives, to visit households or convene group meetings to publicize and mobilize signatures. In this way, the peace signature campaign was universally launched in the two villages. Within one day, the number of people signing in Liuxia Town's Fifth Village accounted for more than 90 percent of the village's farmers, and in Wuchang Township's Tenth Village, it accounted for 75 percent. The next day, each village continued to publicize to every household. As of August 24th, Liuxia Town collected 3,621 signatures, accounting for 81 percent of the town's population, and Wuchang Township collected 4,981 signatures, accounting for 88 percent of the total population.

　　农村和平签名运动的典型经验
    庄浦明
    浙江杭县的留下区最初发动和平签名是在该区留下镇，那时正是六月中旬，农村下种插秧较忙的时候。区里面没有进行深入的宣传，村干部就到每家去动员签名，结果男的签，女的不签，或是每家家长签了就算了。留下镇的职工比较积极，组织了宣传队，但缺乏领导，情绪不高，碰了壁也就停顿了。群众中反而引起了许多顾虑和怀疑，如有的认为签名是“签到”，是“调查户口”，是“发粮食”，或许是“要抽壮丁打仗”等等。
    区领导上总结了失败的原因，认为主要的是：没有和农村中心工作结合，孤立进行；事先没有充分宣传和教育；没有发挥各组织及群众中积极分子的作用。
    当时区里正在展开大规模的治虫运动，区乡领导接受过去的经验教训，随即有计划地把和平签名与治虫运动结合起来进行。首先利用各种集会场合对群众进行国际形势的教育及和平签名意义的宣传；并组织了镇上职工、小学教员、青年团员、妇女代表三十六人成立了宣传队，一面宣传点灯治虫，一面进行和平签名的宣传。八月十五日留下镇全镇户户点灯，人人动手治虫。天一黑，群众都锁了门到田畈里来，在灯下乘凉、拉胡琴、唱戏、读报、闲谈，小贩也来叫卖。这时宣传队就打起锣鼓，领导群众唱歌，并用喇叭筒向聚集大路上的群众进行宣传，用极简单而具体的材料联系群众思想说明为什么要签名？签了名有什么用？在公路上、大路要口上设立了签名处，在热烈情况下群众都争先签名，那一夜即有七百一十六人签名。
    五常乡接受了留下镇的经验，八月十七、十八两天，在各村动员治虫会上简单地说明了和平签名的意义，使群众有了初步认识。十九日发动了全乡二千五百余人集体摘卵块运动，村干部在大队出发前号召大家在轮流休息的时候到大路旁的签名处去签名。他们又组织了青年团员和青年积极分子十五人，担任签名处的布置、宣传、服务。在这样与除虫运动结合之下，参加除虫的人百分之八十五签了名，占五常乡全乡人口百分之四十。
    留下镇五村、五常乡十村分别利用采卵块动员会及农会的会议后，由村干部、农会委员、积极分子、青年团员、妇女代表举行座谈，首先自己再进一步搞通和平签名的意义，并讨论如何使签名意义家喻户晓，每个人都自觉地签名。讨论结果决定以农会委员小组长为核心，并由青年团员妇女代表协助，按家访问或召开小组会宣传并发动签名。和平签名就这样在两个村普遍展开起来，一天内留下镇五村签名的人就占全村农民百分之九十以上，五常乡十村占百分之七十五。第二天各村继续向每家每户宣传，截至八月二十四日，留下镇征集了三千六百二十一人签名，占全镇人口百分之八十一，五常乡征集了四千九百八十一人，占全人口百分之八十八。
