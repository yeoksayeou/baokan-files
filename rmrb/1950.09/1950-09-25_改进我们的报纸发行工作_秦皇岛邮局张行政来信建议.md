　　Improving Our Newspaper Distribution Work
　　Letter of Suggestion from Zhang Xingzheng of Qinhuangdao Post Office
　　To the Editorial Comrades:

　　The bureau has repeatedly raised the issue of integrated postal delivery and distribution, and called on our postal workers to learn how to do distribution work and vigorously promote newspapers. All the employees of our bureau have taken action and are welcoming this glorious task with joy. However, the distribution sections of various regional management bureaus under the leadership of the Distribution Department of the General Bureau do not pay enough attention to the distribution work, and errors often occur, which greatly hinders the promotion of newspapers. Take the distribution section of the Beijing Postal Management Bureau as an example. In June, it continuously under-delivered the People's Daily for two days, 152 copies each day. The reason was that the receiving and dispatching staff opened and suppressed the increase/decrease notification slips. In September, it under-delivered the newspaper for two consecutive days again, 82 copies each day. The newly developed "World Knowledge" notification slip was sent on August 30, but the publication has not yet been issued, nor has a reply been received. The distribution section of the Tianjin Postal Management Bureau also often experiences similar phenomena. On the 1st of this month, 30 copies of the Tianjin Daily were under-delivered, one copy each on the 4th and 5th, five copies on the 6th, ten copies on the 7th, and seven copies in August. The distribution section of the Northeast Postal Management Bureau also has this situation. The Northeast Daily from the 1st to the 4th of this month was not delivered at all. It was not until the 5th that the newspapers for the five days were delivered all together. After our inquiry, we learned that the person in charge of the office was on sick leave and no one was in charge. As a result, some subscribers came with receipts to demand a refund, and some thought we were cheaters and wanted to accuse us in the newspapers.

　　In addition, the distribution sections of various bureaus have a careless work style, while the Distribution Department of the General Bureau has a bureaucratic work style. They only know how to issue calls, ask the distribution sections of various management bureaus for tasks and figures, but do not go deep into understanding the work situation, and try to help and improve the distribution work, so errors occur continuously. I hope that the distribution sections in various places will, in this rectification movement, combine their own work, conduct serious inspections, find out the causes of the errors, formulate methods to overcome the shortcomings, and strive to do a good job in our newspaper and journal distribution work.

### 改进我们的报纸发行工作  秦皇岛邮局张行政来信建议

　　改进我们的报纸发行工作
    秦皇岛邮局张行政来信建议编辑同志：
    局方曾一再提出邮发合一的问题，并号召我们邮政员工都要学会做发行工作，大量推广报纸。我局全体员工已经行动起来、以愉快的心情迎接这个光荣的任务。但是，在总局发行处领导下的各区管局发行科，对发行工作不够重视，经常发生错误，对报纸推广工作给予了很大的困难。拿北京邮管局发行科来说，在六月份曾连续少发两天人民日报，每日各一百五十二份。其原因是由于收发员将增减通知单拆开后压下了。九月份又连续少发两天的报纸，各八十二份。本月七日人民日报又少正页二份。新发展的“世界知识”通知单在八月三十日就寄去了，但刊物迄今尚未发下，也未获答复。天津邮管局发行科也常发生与此类似的现象。本月一日少发天津日报三十份，四五两日各少一份，六日少五份，七日少十份，八月少七份。东北邮管局发行科也有这样的情形，本月一——四日的东北日报全数未发，到五日才将五天的报纸一齐发来。经过我们问询以后，才知道该处负责人因请病假无人负责。因此，有的订户便拿着收据来要求退钱，有的认为我们是骗子，要在报纸上指责我们。
    此外，各局发行科有粗枝大叶的作风，而总局发行处则存在官僚主义作风，他们只知道发号召，向各管局发行科要任务，要数字，而不去深入地了解工作情况，设法帮助和改进发行工作，因此连续发生错误。我希望各地发行科在这次整风中，结合本身的工作，认真进行检查，找出错误的原因，订出克服缺点的办法，为搞好我们的报刊发行工作而努力。                秦皇岛邮政局  张行政
