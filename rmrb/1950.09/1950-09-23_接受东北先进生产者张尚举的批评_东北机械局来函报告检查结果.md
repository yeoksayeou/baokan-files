　　Editor's Note: After this newspaper published Comrade Zhang Shangju, an advanced producer in the Northeast, on the second page of the August 21st issue, criticizing the production leadership of the Northeast Mechanical Bureau, the bureau immediately held consecutive meetings to conduct inspections, and on September 11th, sent a letter reporting the results of the inspection, expressing welcome for this criticism and suggestions that were beneficial to improving work. The original letter is published as follows:

　　To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:

　　Comrade Zhang Shangju of the No. 3 Machine Factory raised a public criticism regarding the stoppage of work and waiting for materials during the July lathe task of the No. 3 Factory due to the delayed supply of the 32212 roller, which even affected the quality of the product. This spirit of actively taking responsibility for national production is worth promoting. This matter shows that there are many shortcomings in the business leadership of our bureau, such as unclear responsibilities of various departments and insufficient communication, which caused problems like the one in the No. 3 Factory. In order to accept this lesson and improve future work, we have convened several meetings to specifically inspect this matter. The results of the inspection indicate that, in addition to the above-mentioned reasons that should be improved, the two directly related sections also have the following shortcomings:

　　1. Planning Section – The plan of the Planning Section was issued on April 17th, with the content being 20 sets to be produced in June, 80 sets in July, and 80 sets in August. However, the No. 3 Factory needed to use them in March, April, and May, but the Planning Section had not planned for this. This fully demonstrates that the plan was divorced from actual needs and was merely subjectively imagined, so mistakes occurred. Of course, the Materials Section, Business Section, Manufacturing Section, and the using units are related in that they failed to provide accurate materials in a timely manner, but it is also wrong that the Planning Section failed to actively contact the relevant departments.

　　2. Manufacturing Section – Although the Planning Section failed to provide an accurate plan, the production tasks of each factory were determined by themselves, and they were aware of the urgency and slackness of production in each factory. It is undeniable that they did not pay close enough attention. They are also undeniably responsible for failing to pay enough attention to the strictness of the tolerance of the 32212 roller.

　　Finally, we welcome criticisms and suggestions like those from Comrade Zhang Shangju, and call on all employees to learn from this spirit of being brave enough to take responsibility in order to improve and enhance our work. With respect!

　　Mechanical Bureau September 11th

### 接受东北先进生产者张尚举的批评  东北机械局来函报告检查结果

　　接受东北先进生产者张尚举的批评
    东北机械局来函报告检查结果
    编者按：八月二十一日本报二版发表了东北先进生产者张尚举同志对东北机械局生产领导的批评后，该局即连续召开会议，进行检查，并于九月十一日来函，报告检查的结果，表示欢迎这一有利于改进工作的批评与建议。兹将原函公布如下：
                人民日报编辑部：
    机器三厂张尚举同志对三厂七月份车床任务由于三二二一二号滚轴供应迟延，发生停工待料现象，甚至影响了产品质量问题，提出公开的批评。这种对国家生产积极负责的精神，是值得发扬的。从这件事情说明我局在业务领导上是存在不少缺点的，如关于各部门的职责不明确，联系不够密切，所以造成像三厂这一类问题的发生。我们为了接受这一经验教训并改进今后工作，曾召集了数次会议，专门对此事进行检查，检查的结果，认为除上述原因应加改进外，直接有关的两个科，也存在着以下缺点：
    一、计划科——计划科的计划是四月十七日下的，内容是六月份生产二十套，七月份八十套，八月份八十套。但三、四、五月份三厂即要使用，而计划科还未计划到。这充分说明了计划脱离了实际需要，只是凭主观想出来的，所以出了错误。当然材料科、业务科、制造科，以及需用单位，未能及时的提供确实的材料是有关系的，而计划科未能主动与有关部门去联系，也是不对的。
    二、制造科——虽然计划科未能提供确实计划，而各厂的生产任务是自己下的，对各厂生产上的急和缓也是知道的，这是无可讳言的是抓的不紧。其对三二二一二号滚轴公差的严格性未能引起足够注意，也是责无旁贷。
    最后我们欢迎像张尚举同志这样的批评与建议，并号召全体职工向这样勇于负责的精神学习。以改进与提高工作。敬礼！
            机械管理局  九、十一
