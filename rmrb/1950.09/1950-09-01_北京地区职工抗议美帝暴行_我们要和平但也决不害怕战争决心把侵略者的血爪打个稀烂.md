　　Beijing Workers Protest U.S. Imperialist Atrocities
    We Want Peace But We Are Not Afraid of War, Determined to Smash the Aggressor's Bloody Claws
    [Our Newspaper] Beijing area railway workers, factory workers, and model workers have protested the U.S. imperialist's atrocities of invading our airspace and wantonly strafing, causing loss of life and property to our people. The workers have expressed their resolute determination to strengthen unity and work hard to give the American provocateurs a heavy blow.
            Railway Workers
    Upon hearing the news of U.S. planes invading our airspace, railway workers in the Beijing area were extremely indignant. They held meetings and discussions, unanimously denouncing the shameless atrocities of U.S. imperialism and proposing practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly defeating U.S. imperialist aggression and defending the sacred and inviolable sovereignty of the motherland. Zhao Tongnian, a track maintenance foreman from the engineering section, said, "We must produce more and not be complacent, so that American and Chiang Kai-shek spies cannot exploit any loopholes." Survey workers Zhang Gengshen, Fu Guiqing, Wang Qinglu, and Lü Shilin all expressed: We should unite with democratic countries around the world and peace-loving people to defeat the U.S. imperialist forces of aggression. Gong Rulin also proposed: Guarantee to work with fellow workers to complete the year's task by the end of October – repairing 153 kilometers and overhauling 32 kilometers and 700 meters without any accidents. Sun Zhonglian and Zhang Wenqing said: "Our response to the U.S. imperialist atrocities is not only to support the liberation of Taiwan but also to support the Korean People's Army in defeating U.S. imperialism!" Hu Tongfeng, a passenger conductor from the Beijing Train Section, said, "U.S. imperialism is following the old path of Japanese fascism, like a mad dog, biting anyone it sees." The entire section, on the basis of completing 500,000 kilometers of accident-free operation, proposed launching a ten-day accident-free practical action to support this protest. Baggage handlers and passenger attendants also proposed improving joint labor, eliminating accidents, and strengthening internal unity to strive to complete and exceed production targets. Workers at the Xizhimen inspection station said: "Those who provoke war will be the first to perish. We must strengthen train inspection work, consolidate the achievements of a day without accidents, eliminate accidents forever, improve production efficiency, support the People's Liberation Army, liberate Taiwan as soon as possible, and smash U.S. imperialist aggression."

            Telecommunications Workers
    Beijing telecommunications workers were very indignant upon seeing the news in the newspaper that U.S. imperialist military aircraft had invaded our northeastern airspace and strafed our people and buildings. Chen Shilin, a model long-distance operator who had made no mistakes in six months, said: "U.S. imperialism invaded our airspace and injured our people, and it will be subjected to the just sanctions of peace-loving people around the world. Our telecommunications bureau is now launching a production competition movement to eliminate errors. I have not made any mistakes in the past six months, and I am willing to further improve this achievement and take practical action to protest the U.S. imperialist aggression."
    Yuan Shikun, a line worker who manufactured carbon powder substitutes and reduced costs by 200 times, said: "The United States thinks it has good weapons, so it is recklessly invading. It invaded our territory Taiwan and used airplanes to invade our northeast. It is like a mad dog running around and biting. We workers must do a good job in production, build up strength, defeat the aggressors, and recover our territory – Taiwan."
    The directly subordinate committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, upon learning of this news, held a symposium at noon on the 29th. The twenty-odd comrades who attended the meeting unanimously pointed out: "Tell the American aggressors that we are not afraid of them. As long as we are united and work hard in production and work, we will completely defeat this paper tiger."
    The Beijing Telecommunications Area Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union, on behalf of all employees, issued a statement on the 29th protesting the U.S. infringement of our sovereignty: "We, representing the 3,600-plus telecommunications workers in Beijing, express our serious protest to the U.S. imperialists for this brutal and inhuman provocation against our country. We believe that the crimes of U.S. imperialism will be unanimously opposed by all peace-loving people around the world, and the arrogance of U.S. imperialism will only make it enter its coffin faster. In addition to firmly supporting the serious protest made by Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government to the United States and the just demands made in the telegram to the United Nations Security Council, we, all telecommunications workers in Beijing, will take practical actions to launch production competitions, eliminate errors, and reduce obstacles as a strong warning to U.S. imperialism."

            Beijing Automobile Repair Factory
    All employees of the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory wrote to this newspaper on August 28, strongly protesting the U.S. imperialist aggression against our territory and airspace. The protest letter stated: "We, all employees of the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory, strongly protest this arrogant atrocity of U.S. imperialism. The working class of our People's Republic of China, through its own heroic actions, won independence, freedom, and democracy from the bloody rule of Japanese fascism and Chiang Kai-shek, the national traitor directly equipped and commanded by the United States; we have also invested in the construction of a new China with the same heroism. Now we are using this heroism and determination to defend the free, peaceful, and democratic life we have won with blood. We want peace, we do not want war, but we are not afraid of war. If you dare to stretch your bloody claws into our territory, we will not hesitate to smash them to pieces!"
    The protest letter also called on: The working class of all China and the peace-loving people of the world, be vigilant against the conspiracies of the war-mongers, strengthen unity, and fight to the end for lasting peace and people's democracy!
            Liulihe Cement Plant
    All employees of the Liulihe Cement Plant of the North China Kiln Industry Company expressed extreme anger at the brutal act of U.S. imperialism invading our northeastern airspace. All employees of the plant stated: The U.S. government must be required to immediately severely punish the perpetrators, compensate for losses, and withdraw the troops invading Taiwan and Korea. The employees mourned the victims with a heavy heart and extended cordial condolences to the injured and their families. Everyone is determined to unite and do a good job in production competition, and take practical actions to demand blood debts from the U.S. aggressors.
                                                     (Ren Zuo)
            Fourth District Model Workers
    At the celebration of the first batch of model workers convened by the Fourth District Federation of Trade Unions of Beijing on August 29, model workers from 43 factories and industries in the district, and 1,600 participating workers, were very angry about the U.S. imperialist invasion of our airspace, which caused loss of life and property to our people. The model workers who spoke at the meeting expressed their gratitude for the leadership of the Communist Party and denounced the atrocities of U.S. imperialism. Model worker Ji Shuncai said: "We resolutely oppose this open aggression by U.S. imperialism, and we believe that we have enough strength to crush any attempt by U.S. imperialism!" The conference unanimously passed a protest against the crimes of U.S. imperialism. Everyone is determined to intensify production, improve culture and technology on different production posts and fight against U.S. imperialism.

            Second Nail Manufacturing Plant
    Wang Yanlong, a model worker from the Second Nail Manufacturing Plant of the Mechanical Bureau, expressed his views, denouncing the shameless act of U.S. imperialist aircraft invading our northeastern airspace and strafing our people. He believes that the U.S. imperialist act of undermining peace and openly provoking is like a moth flying into a flame, courting its own destruction, and cannot threaten the great working class. Wang Yanlong expressed his firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and called on all the factory's workers and technicians to strengthen unity, improve work efficiency, and strive to increase the original rolling task of 180 tons in September to 200 tons; at the same time, to mobilize and complete the repair of the rolling heating furnace in three days (repairing the heating furnace required 40 days under the puppet Manchukuo and Kuomintang reactionary rule), to present a gift to the National Day, and to respond to the provocation of U.S. imperialism.
