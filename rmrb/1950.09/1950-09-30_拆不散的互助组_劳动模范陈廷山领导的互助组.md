　　An Inseparable Mutual Aid Team
    — The Mutual Aid Team Led by Labor Model Chen Tingshan
    If we think of more ways, discuss more with team members, produce more grain, and take care of sideline occupations, the farmers will be willing to help each other.

    Chen Tingshan's mutual aid team was organized in 1947 by six farm households. In the first year, each laborer averaged seven shi of grain; this year it has grown to eleven households, and it is estimated that each person can average twenty-five shi of grain.

    The deeds of Chen Tingshan's mutual aid team have spread throughout Liaodong Province and the Northeast region, becoming a banner for mutual aid teams.

    Why has the grain production of Chen Tingshan's mutual aid team increased so quickly? Chen Tingshan said: "There should be various methods of increasing production, and we must grasp the fat (the main points) and not let go."

    Most of the land in their team is low-lying and swampy, with nine out of ten years resulting in poor harvests. The ridges are small and the ditches are shallow, and the land floods easily. After studying the situation, Chen Tingshan came up with a solution: he led everyone to change three ridges into two and dug twenty-one drainage ditches. Land that originally yielded five or six dou now yields an additional one shi and two dou per mu after improvement. Manure is applied to the cultivated land every year, and large plows and strong livestock are used for spring plowing. The previous practice of two plowings and two harrowings has been changed to two plowings and three harrowings, increasing the land's drought resistance, flood resistance, and fertility.

    In early 1949, Chen Tingshan attended a labor model conference in the province. After listening to the leaders' report on planting paddy rice to produce more grain, he felt enlightened. Upon returning to the village, he carefully calculated the team's labor force and existing land area, estimating that there was not enough land for planting. He then discussed with the team members about reclaiming swampy meadows to grow rice. These swampy meadows in his village were reclaimed by the "pioneering corps" of the puppet Manchurian regime, but because of poor drainage, they did not produce grain and were abandoned. There were many grass roots and tree roots in the meadows, which ordinary plows could not break. Chen Tingshan came up with the idea of installing a plow knife on the plow beam so that the plow knife would cut the grass roots first when plowing, allowing the plow to be used. Ten mu of paddy fields were reclaimed, but they did not know how to grow rice. The first time, they spoiled more than 300 jin of rice seeds. Some people ridiculed them, saying, "It's not easy to eat rice!" Chen Tingshan did not lose heart and went to the nearby Korean farmers who grew rice to learn. The second time, they planted very well. But then there was another problem: there was not enough water for the paddy fields. At this time, Chen Tingshan led the team members to dig ditches and divert the three streams surrounding the village to the paddy fields. As a result, the ten mu of paddy fields yielded twenty-four shi of粳 rice. Other small groups in the village also learned from them to reclaim swampy meadows. Last winter, Chen Tingshan attended the provincial labor model conference for the second time, where the issue of improving mutual aid teams was discussed. After returning to his hometown, he promoted the benefits of organizing and shared his experience at various conferences in the district and village. This spring, the mutual aid team he led added three households and paid more attention to technical improvements. Before sowing, careful seed selection was carried out. The seeds were disinfected with copper sulfate and mixed with blood meal during sowing. At the same time, new farm tools such as reclamation plows, weeding machines, and paddy field weeders awarded by the provincial government were adopted. They also bought a XiongYue耙 harrow and a small foreign plow, which greatly saved labor.

    The team members in Chen Tingshan's mutual aid team said that these achievements were due to the good leadership of Team Leader Chen. When introducing his leadership experience, he said: Mutual aid teams are good, but they are difficult to manage; if you want to manage a mutual aid team well, it is not enough for the team leader to just say nice things, you must always think of ways to produce more grain.

    The team leader cannot be like a tobacco pipe - hot at one end (selfish). For example, when hoeing the ground, the team members all want to hoe their own land first. The team leader should speak up first, hoe his own land first, make a modest gesture, and then let everyone discuss it. The team leader does not assign work, and everyone divides the work with respect and concession. This is called "The meat is fat and the soup is also fat, no one loses out."

    The team leader must be good at planning. How can we save labor? What should we do with the labor saved? If we can save labor and find a way out for the labor force, the team members will be energetic. Therefore, the division of labor must be planned, looking at the amount of land, distance, how easy it is to cultivate, and what crops, and then match the elderly and children according to the strength, and experience of the labor force. Our team always hoes dry land on good days, and weeds the paddy fields, digs drainage ditches in the swampy land, or repairs small field dams when it rains. Last year, the whole team only rested for one day from spring plowing to autumn harvest, and the team members were still happy to say "not tired," and became more energetic the more they worked.

    The team leader must always understand the team members' thoughts, discover problems, and solve problems. Liu Yunzeng in our team is a strong young man. After the land reform, his family of two was given six mu of land and one cow. The team owed him work, and Lao Liu felt that he was "working for others" in the mutual aid team. However, without saying anything, Chen Tingshan discovered his thinking and brought it up at the team meeting. After discussion, the result was to give him two and a half mu of the wasteland reclaimed last year, and everyone would reclaim another three mu of wasteland to repay Lao Liu's work. In this way, Lao Liu worked even harder. The labor price of Chen Lanhua's cow in the team was lower than the general labor price. Chen Lanhua took the cow home silently and would not let others use it. At this time, Chen Tingshan led everyone to discuss and increase his cow labor price.

    Chen Tingshan said: It's not enough to just do this. The team leader must also be a "women's association chairman," which means that you must also understand the situation of the women in the team members' families and organize them to engage in sideline occupations. Otherwise, some people will hold back. Last year, the village's income from raising chickens, raising pigs, weaving straw hats, pulling carts, and collecting firewood was 60.36 million yuan (Northeast currency), accounting for 20% of agricultural income.

    In Chen Tingshan's mutual aid team, everyone discusses matters and only does things with consent; if there is disagreement, they discuss again. With four years of experience, the team members have seen that personal interests and the interests of the whole team are consistent, and they no longer care about personal small interests. They have made very good achievements, but they are not proud. They often exchange experiences with other mutual aid teams and help individual farmers solve difficulties. In this way, they gradually attracted individual farmers to participate in or organize mutual aid teams.

    Chen Tingshan said: "You don't need to ask the farmers, they are happy if they produce more grain. The same work, the group has more harvest. Such a mutual aid team cannot be broken up."

　　拆不散的互助组
    —劳动模范陈廷山领导的互助组
    多想办法，多和组员商量，多打粮食，并且照顾副业，庄稼人就愿意互助起来了。
    陈廷山的互助组，是由六户农家、在一九四七年组织起来的。第一年，每个劳动力平均打粮七石；今年发展到十一户，预计平均每人可打粮二十五石。
    陈廷山互助组的事迹传遍了辽东省，传遍了东北区，成为互助组的旗帜。
    陈廷山互助组增产粮食为什么这样快？陈廷山说：“增产方法要多样，抓住肥的（主要的）不放松。”
    他们组里多是涝洼地，十年九不收，垅小沟浅，见水就淹。陈廷山研究了情况，想出了办法，领导大家，把三垅改成两垅，挖了二十一条排水沟。原来五、六斗产量的地，经过改良，一亩地多打了一石二。耕地年年多上粪，春耕用大铧、硬牲口，往年二铲二趟改成二铲三趟，增加了土地抗旱、抗涝和肥力。
    一九四九年初，陈廷山到省里开劳动模范大会，听了首长关于种水田多打粮的报告，心里好像开了个窃。回到村里，他便把全组的劳动力和现有的地亩仔细算了一下，估计地亩不够种。他便和组员商量开水草甸子（沼地）种稻子。他村这水草甸子是伪满的开拓团开的，因排水不好不打粮食，就给荒了。甸里草根树根多，普通犁杖开不动。陈廷山想出把犁辕上装上一把犁刀，耕时犁刀先把草根割开，这样犁杖就能用了。水田开出了十亩，但不会种稻技术。第一次把三百多斤稻种生坏了。有人讽刺他们说：“大米饭不容易吃啊！”陈廷山并不灰心，去找附近种水稻的朝鲜农民学习。第二次就种的很好。可是又有问题，水田水不够用，这时陈廷山又领导组员挖沟，把绕着村的三股水合引到水田去。结果十亩水田，收了二十四石粳。村里别的小组也都学他们开垦水甸了。去年冬天，陈廷山第二次参加省劳模会，讨论到提高互助组问题。他回乡后，在区、村各种会议上，都宣传了组织起来的好处，并介绍了经验。今年春天，他领导的互助组增加了三户，并更加注意技术改良。播种前，进行了精细的选种。播种时用王铜消毒，用血粉拌种。同时又采用了省府奖给他们的开荒犁、除草机、水田除草器等新农具。自己又买了一台熊岳?耙，和一架小洋犁，大大节省了劳动力。
    陈廷山互助组里做出这些成绩，组员们都说是陈组长领导的好。他介绍自己领导经验时这样说：互助组好，就是难搞；要想搞好互助组，当组长光说漂亮话不行，总得想出办法来多打粮食。
    当组长不能像烟袋——一头热（自私自利）。譬如铲地，组员都想给自己先铲，组长就该先说话，自己铲后。作一个谦让的样子，再让大家讨论。当组长的不分工，大家分工有尊有让。这就叫“肉肥汤也肥，谁也不吃亏”。
    当组长要会打算，怎样才能省工？省出劳动力怎么办？能省工，能给劳力找着出路，组员干的才能有劲。所以分工就要有计划，看地多少，远近，好不好耕种，什么庄稼，然后再根据劳力的强弱，有无经验，把老头小孩也配搭上。我们组总是好天铲旱田，下雨给稻田拔草、挖涝地排水沟、或修小田坝。去年全组从春耕到秋收就八月节歇了一天，组员还都高兴的说“不累”，越干越有劲。
    当组长要经常了解组员思想，发现问题，解决问题。我们组刘云增是个硬实小伙子。两口人土改分了六亩地，一条牛，组里都欠他的工，老刘觉着在互助组“好像给人家扛活”。可是没有开口，陈廷山发现他这种思想后，就在小组会上提出来，大家商量结果把去年开的荒地给他二亩半，下欠的工，大家再开三亩荒还老刘。这样老刘干的就更带劲了。组里陈兰华的牛工价比一般的工价低了。陈兰华不吭声把牛牵回家，不给别人使了。这时，陈廷山就领导大家商量，给他增加了牛工价。
    陈廷山说：光这样还不行。当组长的还要当“妇女会长”。就是组员家的妇女情况也得了解、组织她们搞副业。要不，有的会扯腿。村里去年养鸡、养猪、编草帽、拉脚和打柴共收入六千零三十六万元（东北币），占农产收入的百分之二十。
    陈廷山互助组是有事大家商量，同意才办；不同意再商量。四年的经验，组员都看出个人利益和全组利益一致，再不计较个人的小利害。他们做出很好的成绩，但并不骄傲。常常和别的互助组交流经验。还帮助单干户解决困难。这样，逐渐吸引了单干户参加或组织起互助组来。
    陈廷山说：“庄稼人不用问，多打粮食就高兴。一样干活，小组多收成。这样的互助组拆也拆不散。”
