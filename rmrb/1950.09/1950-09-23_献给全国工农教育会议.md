　　Dedicated to the National Conference on Workers and Peasants Education
    Huang Yanpei
    The term "workers and peasants education" is indeed not new. But the meaning it carries today is very new.

    Reading Article One of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: The People's Republic of China is based on the alliance of workers and peasants. A segment of workers and peasants has already taken on the fundamental task of nation-building. However, the vast masses of workers and peasants are still enrolled in the army of illiteracy. The People's Government is naturally willing to make the greatest effort to shoulder the responsibility of liberating them spiritually. Moreover, since the national liberation and the implementation of land reform, the demand for education from the workers and peasants has become stronger and stronger, developing like a surging tide.

    But the work of workers and peasants education has been done in China for a long time. Ancient Chinese books speak of education. The earliest is Mencius saying "Houji taught the people to cultivate," isn't this a form of partial workers and peasants education! But ultimately, none of these count as education. Otherwise, how would there be a term like "intellectual class"? The establishment of the term "intellectual class" illustrates that education is limited to this class. Outside of it, there is no education. Representing this class are the "scholars." Other than the "scholars," "workers" and "peasants" are born without the opportunity to enjoy education.

    For fifty years, China has implemented new education. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, some have advocated universal education – then called compulsory education. Later, some advocated rural education – also called village education. Twenty-five years ago, some advocated spare-time education. The targets of these initiatives all included workers and peasants. However, there has never been a comprehensive plan, all were unsystematic and incomplete. Today, only through the power of the government can it be carried out on a large scale. Making this term become old turned new.

    In this incomplete education movement, I once joined with comrades and put in some effort. Today, I am very happy and, based on my experience, I offer the following two suggestions:

    (1) Education cannot be achieved quickly. Workers and peasants education is naturally no exception. However, reducing time through streamlining is entirely possible, and greatly needed.

    The issues discussed at the Workers and Peasants Education Conference mainly concern workers and peasants spare-time education, including literacy education, workers and peasants quick-track middle schools, and so on. Let's first talk about middle schools. The standard age for regular middle school is thirteen, fourteen, and fifteen for junior high school, and sixteen, seventeen, and eighteen for senior high school. Workers and peasants who are older, due to more contact with practical life, are more mature in thought and have richer common sense. Although it is still middle school, the pace can certainly be accelerated. This is one aspect. Another aspect is that if the middle school curriculum is condensed, retaining what workers and peasants need while eliminating what they don't need as much as possible. The original general middle school curriculum and teaching materials are too complex, too heavy, and too deep. Applying them to workers and peasants requires much greater reduction, thus shortening the time. Speaking of literacy education, I would like to solemnly introduce Mr. Li Buqing, who is present. The literacy education method he invented is absolutely effective. Why do I determine it to be absolutely effective? Because I have personally tested it. The experience of testing this teaching method is written below:

    In April 1935, I traveled to Kaifeng and went out of Cao Gate – the southeast gate, to a peasant's home. An illiterate 46-year-old grandmother's son was teaching her to read using the new method used in the Kaifeng Education Experimental Zone, which was run by Mr. Li Buqing. He used strips of paper to write sentences from common speech, teaching her to read them. Such as "Have you eaten?" "I'm hungry," etc. She quickly became familiar with them because they were all everyday words. He also wrote the character "门" (door) on the door and pasted it up. He wrote "桌子" (table) on the table and pasted them up. I wanted to test her, writing the difficult-to-write and difficult-to-recognize character "盐" (salt) to see if she knew it. She seemed to think I was looking down on her and immediately replied: "Isn't this salt?!" Turning her neck. That moment of impression is still in my mind today.

    In May, I traveled to Mount Hua. It was late, and I stayed overnight at the South Peak. I gathered a group of porters and carriers who came with me and asked who could read. One person replied: I can. The others could not. So I talked to those who were illiterate, still using Mr. Li's method, taking the sentences from each person's answers and writing them on strips of paper, such as "My home is in Shangdong'er," "I don't smoke opium," etc., teaching them to read them one by one. The next morning, when we reached the foot of the mountain, I asked them one by one, and they could all read. They were as happy as if they had found gold. They wanted me to open a school in Shangdong'er. One of them was inspired with patriotism from the conversation and pointed to a "Bandit Brand" cigarette on the table, asking me: "Is this a Chinese product?" I replied: "It's a foreign product." He immediately threw away a pack of cigarettes, saying: "We shouldn't smoke foreign cigarettes."

    Mr. Li's method is indeed effective. The benefit is that it combines education with life. Utilizing their living environment, absorbing it as educational material, this is the most streamlined method. Now that Mr. Li has been invited to attend, I hope to inquire and adopt his methods.

    (2) The first step in workers and peasants education is to focus on political education. Combine it with cultural education. But it must ultimately lead to technical education and production education.

    The above example of inspiring patriotism from literacy education and immediately throwing away Bandit Brand cigarettes is the powerful influence that political education combined with cultural education can have.

    Workers and peasants who initially receive cultural education, such as Mr. Li's method, suddenly seem to regain their sight and are naturally very interested. If political education is integrated, the interest is even stronger. But according to my experience, it is necessary to further help them in their lives to strengthen their enthusiasm for learning. Especially older learners, driven by a desire for knowledge on one hand, and inevitably feeling the pressure of life on the other, if their practical needs cannot be met, their temporary excitement will be difficult to sustain. I advocate that workers and peasants middle schools must provide technical training in the later stages, perhaps needing to be divided into specialized subjects. Two thousand years ago, under the feudal system, "the son of a craftsman is always a craftsman," "the son of a farmer is always a farmer," is of course not in line with the requirements of the current era, but in the initial stage of the new China's construction, it is precisely necessary to develop production and prosper the economy. Educating workers and peasants so that they come from the production environment, return to the production environment, or never leave the production environment, this kind of education should be considered the best. We must strive for this.

    Finally, I would like to raise one more point. The human mind is an inexhaustible treasure. The minds of workers and peasants are also treasures, which have not been well explored. We must use all our strength to explore these many new treasures. This initial exploration is the workers and peasants education that is beginning today. Moreover, the future of the new China requires even greater strength in defending peace. The People's Liberation Army has only a few million people. If the vast masses of workers and peasants, accounting for 80-90% of the country's population, are fully educated in politics, culture, and technology, and stand up, unite, and produce more powerfully, they will certainly give the world peace and human security an infinitely great influence in terms of human and material resources. This is truly worth great effort.

　　献给全国工农教育会议
    黄炎培
    工农教育一名词，说它并不太新，是确的。但今天提到它，这意义倒是很新的。
    读人民政协共同纲领第一条，中华人民共和国。是以工农联盟为基础的。一部分工人和农民已经负起建国基本任务了。但广大的工农群众，依然被编制在文盲大队里，人民政府自然愿意尽最大努力来担负精神上解放他们的责任。而况全国解放，土改实行以后，工农群众的要求教育，一天强烈一天，正像狂潮般在发展。
    可是工农教育这件事，中国从早就搞过的。中国古书讲教育。顶早是孟子说“后稷教民稼穑”，这还不是部分的工农教育吗！到底这些都说不上教育的。不然，怎么会有“知识阶级”一名词呢？知识阶级一名词的成立，就说明了教育限于这一阶级。以外是没有教育的了。代表这一阶级，是“士”，士以外“工”“农”，他们生来就没有机会享受教育。
    五十年来，中国施行新教育，从民国成立起，就有人提倡普及教育——当时称义务教育，后来还有人倡办农村教育——亦称乡村教育，二十五年前有人倡办业余教育。这些对象中间，都包括工农的。可是从来没有整个计画，都是无系统，不彻底。到了今天，才由政府的力量来大规模举办。使这个名词，变成了旧翻新。
    我在这不彻底的教育运动中间，曾经结合了同志，卖过一番力。今天太高兴了，本着我的经验，贡献下开两点意见：
    （一）教育不可能速成的。工农教育，当然无例外。只是从精简中节减时间，倒是大大可能，而且是大大需要。
    工农教育会议所讨论的问题，主要是工农业余教育，包括识字教育，工农速成中学等。先来谈谈中学。正规的中学，标准年龄，初中是十三十四和十五。高中是十六十七和十八。工农出身若是年龄较大些，因实际生活的接触较多，思想较成熟了，常识较丰富了。虽然同是中学，进度当然可以加快些。这是一层。又一层如果把中学课程紧缩些，保留工农所需要的，而尽量删减他们所不需要的。原来一般中学课程和教材，失之太繁，太重，太深。施之于工农，更需要大大地删减，这样，时间便节短了。说到识字教育，我愿意很郑重地介绍在座一位李步青老先生，他所发明的识字教育方法是绝对有效的。我何以断定为绝对有效？因为我是亲身试验过的。把试验这教法的经过写在下边：
    一九三五年四月我游开封出曹门——东南门，到一农民家，一位四十六岁老奶奶，不识字，她的儿子用李步青老先生主办的开封教育实验区所用新方法教她识字，用纸条写通常说话中间的句子，教她读。如“你吃过饭没有”，“我肚子饿了”之类，一读便熟，因为都是日常话语的缘故。还在门上写一“门”字贴起来。桌子上写“桌子”两字贴起来，我想考验一下，写一个很难写难识的“盐”字使她识，她似乎嫌我太轻视她样子，立刻答复我：“这还不是盐么？！”把头颈一扭。一霎那间印象，至今在我脑海里。
    五月游华山，天晚，宿在南峰。招同来的一群轿夫挑夫团坐，问谁识字？一人答：我识。余人不识。乃和不识字者谈，仍用李老先生方法，取每人答问的语句，写在纸条上，如“我家在上洞儿”，“我不抽鸦片”等，教他们一个个读。明早，到山下，一个个问，都能读了。他们快活得像拾着黄金一样。要我在上洞儿地方开一学校。中间一人从谈话中激发了爱国心，指桌上强盗牌香烟，问我：“是否中国货”？我答：“是外国货”，他立即把一盒烟扔掉，说：“我们不应该吃外国烟”。
    李老先生的方法确实有效。好处就是教育和生活结合。利用他们生活的环境，吸收来做教育的资料，这就是最精简的方法。今李老先生被邀出席了，希望问明采用。
    （二）工农教育第一步要重点发挥政治教育。拿来和文化教育结合。但必须归宿到技术教育，生产教育。
    上文从识字教育中激发了爱国心，立刻把强盗牌香烟扔掉，这就是政治教育结合了文化教育所发生出来的有力的影响。
    工人农民们初步接受到文化教育，如李老先生的方法，顿时好像盲目复明，自然大感兴趣。如渗入了政治教育，兴趣更浓。但依我的经验，必须进一步使他们于生活上得到帮助。才能坚定他们好学的情绪。尤其是年长失学者们，一面为求知欲所驱使，一面又免不了感受到生活压迫，如无法满足他们事实上要求，一时的兴奋，其势将难于持久，我主张工农中学后期必须予以技术训练，也许需要分科，二千年前封建制度下“工之子恒为工”，“农之子恒为农”，当然不合现今时代要求，但新中华建设初期。正需要发展生产，繁荣经济。使工人农民们受到教育，从生产环境中来，回到生产环境中去，或更始终不离生产环境，这种教育应认为是最好的。我们必须尽力争取这一点。
    末了，更愿提出一点，人类的脑海，是取之无尽，用之不穷的宝藏。工人农民们的脑海，同样是宝藏，还没有好好发掘过。我们要运用一切力量，去发掘这许多新的宝藏，这初步的发掘工作，就是今天开始进行的工农教育。而况新中国的前途，在保卫和平上还需要更大的力量。人民解放军只几百万人。如果全国百分之八九十这样广大的工农群众，因充分接受了政治文化教育和技术教育，更有力地大家站立起来，团结起来，生产起来，在人力上，物力上，定将给予世界和平和人类安全以无穷伟大的影响。这真值得大大努力。
              一九五○年九月二十一日
