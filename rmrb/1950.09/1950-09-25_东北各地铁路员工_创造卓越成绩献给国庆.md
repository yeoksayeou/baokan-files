Northeast China Railway Employees
    Create Outstanding Achievements to Dedicate to National Day
    [Our Newspaper] Railway employees in various parts of Northeast China are working with high production enthusiasm to create outstanding achievements as a gift to the first National Day. For example, the first contracted repair team of the Suihua Locomotive Depot Factory has safely traveled 1,861,257.2 kilometers without a single overhaul accident from November 8, 1948, to September 11, 1950, thanks to the efforts of all workers in the team, setting the highest record for safe kilometers traveled by a contracted repair team in Northeast China's railways. The entire team has proposed to achieve the goal of 2 million safe kilometers traveled before October 1st as a gift to welcome National Day. The contracted locomotive teams of Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot have also set out plans to resolutely guarantee the completion of 500 kilometers for five consecutive days to welcome National Day. In reality, the Locomotive Team No. 926 has exceeded 500 kilometers for six consecutive days since September 2nd, averaging 565 kilometers. Other teams, such as Locomotive Team Nos. 1036 and 1032, have also exceeded 500 kilometers for five or six consecutive days. All workers in the Huanggu Tun Rolling Stock Depot are determined to repair a dilapidated passenger car that has been exposed to wind and rain for many years before October 1st. The Sanke Shu Rolling Stock Depot has revived two dead cars from the scrap iron pile and saved 500 million Northeast currency as a gift for National Day. From September 1st to 11th, the Siping Rolling Stock Depot has also repaired two locomotives in eleven days. The Yixian and Xifuxin engineering sections of the West Fuxin Sub-bureau are striving to complete the maintenance of the lines under their jurisdiction according to the new road maintenance method before October 1st to ensure traffic safety and lay a good foundation for winter transportation as a gift for National Day. Among them, the Yixian Engineering Section has completed 162 kilometers and 924 meters of lines from August to early September, and the Xifuxin Engineering Section has completed 195 kilometers and 419 meters, completing 88.2 percent of the lines under the jurisdiction of the entire sub-bureau. The two engineering sections are now determined to guarantee the completion of all tasks before September 26th and achieve a level of 20 percent excellent and 30 percent good, while ensuring no engineering responsibility accidents. Although the Zhengjiatun Station lost its banner for winning the advanced cycle award in August due to two responsibility accidents, all workers at the station expressed their determination to win back the banner in the September production competition. The Baichengzi Station responded to the challenge of the Changchun Railway Bureau and launched challenges and responses between individuals, teams, and departments, and made a "Challenge Victory Board."
    Some units want to use early completion of tasks as a gift. For example, the Jiamusi Engineering Section, in addition to completing the annual production tasks of more than 159 kilometers of mainline, more than 56 kilometers of sidings, and more than 190 sets of turnouts, 26 days ahead of schedule by September 4th, has now proposed to universally find small pits and fill them three times by the end of September to ensure safe winter transportation. After completing the annual road maintenance work, the Yimianpo Road Maintenance Area, all workers are now preparing to help the unfinished work areas complete their tasks. Workers in various places are enthusiastically engaged in production competitions, constantly playing the advanced role of advanced producers as a gift to commemorate the first anniversary of the founding of New China.

    有的单位要用提前完成任务作为献礼。如佳木斯工务段除将全年生产任务本线一百五十九公里多；侧线五十六公里多；道岔一百九十余组，截至九月四日止，全部提前二十六天胜利完成外，现该段又提出到九月末普遍找小坑作三遍，保证冬季运输安全。一面坡养路工区完成全年养路修补工作后；现全体工友又准备去帮助没有完成的工区完成工作任务。各地工友均以高度生产热情，紧张地投入生产竞赛，以不断发挥先进生产者的先进作用来作为对新中国成立一周年纪念的献礼。（李文芝、王岁悦、瑞涛、任庆海、东北日报）
