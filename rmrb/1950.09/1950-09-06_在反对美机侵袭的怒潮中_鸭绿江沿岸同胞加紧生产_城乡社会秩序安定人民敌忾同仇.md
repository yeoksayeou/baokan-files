Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 5th: Amidst the tide of anger against American aircraft intruding into our airspace and strafing our compatriots, the people along the Yalu River are further intensifying production, and social order is very stable.

The Linjiang and Dalizi railway stations, shortly after being strafed by American aircraft on August 27th, had already resumed normal operation of passenger and freight trains. Except for a shortfall of 400 tons on the 27th, freight transport tasks have been completed at 100% of the planned tonnage since the 28th.

Locomotive No. 268, which was damaged by American aircraft, was repaired on the same day and continued to operate normally between Tonghua and Linjiang. Locomotive No. 1147, after round-the-clock repairs by workers, was also fired up and put into operation on the evening of August 29th. The remaining locomotives Nos. 928, passenger car No. 262, and guard car No. 446, which were damaged by American aircraft, are being actively repaired.

The miners near the Dalizi railway station are also highly enthusiastic about production. They organized current affairs studies, discussed and further recognized the American imperialists' aggressive conspiracy, and at the same time continued to launch a production competition to welcome National Day according to the original plan. The ore output on August 30th increased by more than 8% compared to August 26th.

In the villages near the Linjiang city Jiangqiao bridge, preparations for the autumn harvest are also complete. While writing various indignant slogans on blackboard newspapers condemning the crimes of American aircraft invasion, the farmers also announced their fertilizer accumulation achievements for next year's increased production and this year's autumn harvest plan. Since the American aircraft raid on Jiangqiao Hexi Village on August 27th, the farmers have become more concerned about current affairs studies. The village's women's literacy night school has increased from more than ten people to more than thirty in a few days.

The market in Linjiang city is also very stable, and the stores have prepared all the goods to supply the people for the Mid-Autumn Festival. From August 27th to September 4th, 20 private sundry goods shops and weaving businesses have applied to the People's Government for business licenses. In the areas near Andong in the lower reaches of the Yalu River, urban and rural material exchanges have become more active recently than before. State-owned trading companies have organized large-scale transportation work, continuing to purchase large quantities of surplus grain from farmers while supplying the people with general merchandise, winter coal, cloth and other materials needed for autumn and winter. According to incomplete statistics, since the beginning of the third quarter, more than 10,680 carloads of these goods have been transported via the Changchun Railway and the An(dong)-Shen(yang) Railway.

　　在反对美机侵袭的怒潮中
    鸭绿江沿岸同胞加紧生产
    城乡社会秩序安定人民敌忾同仇
    【新华社沈阳五日电】鸭绿江沿岸人民在反对美机侵入我领空扫射我同胞的怒潮中，正进一步加紧生产，社会秩序十分安定。
    临江、大栗子两车站，在上月二十七日遭受美机扫射后不久，客货车即已恢复正点运行。货物运输任务除二十七日少运四百吨外，自二十八日起都是百分之百地完成计划吨数。
    被美机击坏的二六八号机车于当日修好后，仍照常运行于通化临江等各地。一一四七号机车经工人的昼夜抢修，亦于上月二十九日晚升火开行。其余被美机击坏的九二八号机车、二六二号客车及四四六号守护车均在积极抢修中。
    大栗子车站附近的矿山工人，生产热情也很高涨。他们曾组织了时事学习，讨论了并进一步认识了美帝国主义的侵略阴谋，同时继续按照原订计划掀起了迎接国庆节的生产竞赛热潮。上月三十日的矿石产量，已较同月二十六日增加百分之八强。
    临江城江桥附近的村庄，秋收准备工作亦已就绪。农民们一面在黑板报上写着反对美机侵略罪行的各种激愤的标语，一面公布了自己为明年增产而进行的积肥成绩和今年的秋收计划。江桥河西村农民自上月二十七日美机空袭该地后，对于时事学习更加关心。该村妇女识字夜校在数天内即由过去十余人增至三十余人。
    临江城内市面也甚为安定，各商店为供应人民过中秋节的货物均已准备齐全。自上月二十七日至本月四日间，并有二十家私营杂货铺及织布业向人民政府申请开业经营。鸭绿江下游安东附近各地，近来城乡物资交流比前更趋活跃。国营贸易公司组织了庞大的运输工作，一面继续收购农民的大量余粮，一面供应人民秋冬需要的百货、冬煤、布匹等物资。据不完全统计：自第三季度开始，这些货物经过中长铁路和安（东）沈（阳）铁路运输的即达一万零六百八十余车。
