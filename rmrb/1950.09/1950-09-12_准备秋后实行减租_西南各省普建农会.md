Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 2nd: Vast rural areas in the Southwest Administrative Region are universally establishing farmers' associations in preparation for implementing rent reduction after this year's autumn harvest. According to incomplete statistics from the four administrative regions of Eastern Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, Western Sichuan, and Northern Sichuan, there are already approximately 2.5 million members of farmers' associations, along with tens of thousands of militiamen in self-defense forces. Seventy percent of the counties in these four regions have established preparatory committees for county farmers' associations. In Guiyang and Zunyi in Guizhou Province, many areas in central, eastern, and southern Yunnan Province, and Ya'an in Xikang Province, farmers are also organizing.

Farmers in the Southwest are gradually organizing during the progressive development of rural work such as bandit suppression, grain requisition, and production. The vast majority of bandit remnants in the Southwest's rural areas have been eliminated, over 90 percent of the grain requisition task for 1949 has been completed, and the agricultural production movement is also unfolding. Through these mass movements, the consciousness and enthusiasm of the farmers have greatly increased. The development of farmers' association organizations in these areas generally involves county-level training of activists from poor and hired farmers who have emerged in rural work in each county. These activists then return to their villages to establish farmers' association groups, developing members around these groups as the core. In rural areas where bandit harassment is more intense or feudal remnants are stronger, enlightened farmers are also establishing their own organizations with the assistance of cadres from higher-level farmers' associations through individual membership recruitment. Many counties in Eastern and Southern Sichuan, among other regions, have recently convened county people's representative conferences or county farmer representative conferences. The preparatory committees of the county farmers' associations are promoting outstanding farmer representatives with pure class backgrounds who attend these meetings to return to their villages to undertake the work of propaganda and establishing farmers' association organizations. Consequently, the development of farmers' association organizations in these areas is relatively rapid.

In the development of farmers' associations, various regions have already discovered biases in two aspects. Some regions have a tendency towards closed-doorism, such as requiring three registration forms for membership with numerous procedures, and even demanding excessively high conditions from farmers wishing to join the farmers' association, such as "those with three mu of land cannot join" and "members must be completely selfless." The majority of middle peasants and poor intellectuals in these rural areas are often rejected from membership. Other regions have a tendency towards formalism, developing members through signature registration, allowing some bad elements to take the opportunity to infiltrate the farmers' association. Currently, over fifty counties in Eastern Sichuan, Southern Sichuan, and Western Sichuan have opened training classes for township farmers' association cadres, with over eight thousand township farmer cadres studying documents such as the "General Rules for the Organization of Farmers' Associations" and the classification of classes in order to develop members and rectify existing organizations after returning to their villages. Some regions are rectifying while learning.

The development and rectification of farmers' associations is a central link in the preparatory work for rent reduction in the Southwest region. In addition, the Southwest Bureau of the CCP and various provinces and administrative regions are training rent reduction cadres; provincial (regional) and county governments have mostly convened people's representative conferences or farmer representative conferences. The Yunnan and Guizhou Provincial Committees of the CCP and the Northern Sichuan Regional Committee of the Party have convened Party congresses. The central topic of these meetings is how to implement the rent reduction regulations of the Southwest Military and Political Committee in various provinces to implement rent reduction.

### 准备秋后实行减租  西南各省普建农会

　　准备秋后实行减租  西南各省普建农会
    【新华社重庆二日电】西南大行政区的广大农村正在普遍地建立农民协会，准备在今年秋后实行减租。据川东、川南、川西、川北四个行政区的不完全统计，农民协会会员已有二百五十万左右，并有民兵自卫队十几万人。这四个区百分之七十的县都已有了县农民协会筹备委员会的组织。贵州省贵阳、遵义等地，云南省滇中、滇东、滇南许多地区，和西康省雅安等地，农民都正在组织起来。
    西南农民是在剿匪、征粮和生产等农村工作的逐步开展中逐步组织起来的。西南绝大部分农村股匪已经肃清，一九四九年的征粮任务已经完成了百分之九十以上，农业生产运动亦正在展开。经过这些群众性的运动，农民的觉悟和积极性都已大大提高。这些地区农民协会组织的发展，一般是由县集训各该县在农村工作中涌现的贫雇农民中的积极分子，然后由他们回乡建立农民协会的小组，以小组为核心发展会员。在土匪骚扰较烈或封建残余势力较大的农村，觉悟的农民也正在上级农民协会干部的协助下，以个别吸收会员方式建立自己的组织。川东、川南等区许多县最近纷纷召开县各界人民代表会议或县农民代表会议。各县农民协会筹委会，即推动出席这些会议的成份纯洁的优秀农民代表，回乡担任宣传和建立农民协会组织的工作。因之，这些地区，农民协会的组织发展较为迅速。
    在农民协会的发展中，各区已经发现两方面的偏向。有的地区有关门主义的偏向，如入会必须填表三张，手续繁多，甚至有的向要求加入农会的农民提出“有田三亩不能入会”、“会员必须大公无私”等过高条件。这些地区的大多数中农和农村中的贫苦知识分子多被拒于会外。而另一些地区则有形式主义的偏向，以签名登记方式发展会员，致使一些坏分子得以乘机混入农会。现川东、川南和川西已有五十多县开办了乡农民协会干部的训练班，八千多名乡农民干部正在学习《农民协会组织通则》和划分阶级等文件，以便回乡后一面发展会员，一面对原有组织进行整顿。有些地区则在一面学习一面整顿。
    农民协会的发展和整顿，是西南区减租准备工作的中心一环。此外，中共西南局及各省、各行政区都在训练减租干部；各省（区）、县政府多已召开了各界人民代表会议或农民代表会议，中共云南、贵州省委会和川北区党委会，均已召开了党代会议。这些会议，都是以如何在各省贯彻执行西南军政委员会的减租条例实施减租为其中心议题。
