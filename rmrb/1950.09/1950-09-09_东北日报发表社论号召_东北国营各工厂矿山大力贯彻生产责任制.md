　　[Report from this newspaper] The Northeast Daily published an editorial on August 27th entitled "Further Implement the Production Responsibility System." The article first affirmed the achievements since the Northeast Industrial Department issued decisions on establishing a production responsibility system, launching a major safety inspection campaign, and ensuring and improving product quality. At the same time, it pointed out that there are still many problems in implementing the production responsibility system. This is manifested in: although the safety work of some factories and mines has improved, it has not fundamentally improved. For example, although the number of serious injuries and deaths in the Fuxin Coal Mine in the second quarter decreased compared with the first quarter, there were still 6 deaths, 34 serious injuries, and 153 minor injuries, and the number of accidents increased by 18.4% compared with the first quarter. Fushun Coal Mine and various factories had 342 accidents in April. Although the number decreased to 132 in May, most of them were still responsibility accidents. In terms of ensuring quality: the most serious problem is the poor quality of basic construction projects, which causes huge losses to the country. According to statistics from the Ministry of Industry, the direct losses caused by poor quality of red bricks, asbestos tiles, and wood alone amounted to more than 800 billion yuan (Northeast currency). As for the low quality of basic construction projects caused by the poor quality of building materials, the losses to the country are even greater. In addition, waste caused by errors in planning and design by the leadership is also very serious. For example, the Langtou water source construction project of the Andong Smelter was reworked four or five times due to the leadership's lack of attention and technical guidance; when building the Dashiqiao warehouse, the entire frame collapsed after it was erected, injuring workers and breaking the frame. Other situations, such as brick walls being built with convex backs and brick joints being as wide as 30 to 40 millimeters, are common. In terms of production: the defective product rate of Machine Factory No. 6 increased by 1.29% compared with May, the tool factory increased by 5.35%, the vertical drilling machines and bench beds of the Automobile Main Factory are still third- or fourth-class products, and 70% of the cloth produced by Textile Factory No. 1 does not meet specifications.

    The editorial further analyzed the reasons for the above-mentioned phenomena: mainly because some leading cadres of factories and mines do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of establishing a production responsibility system, lack leadership and inspection, and some even oppose the establishment of a production responsibility system and the completion of production tasks. In the implementation, the masses were not fully mobilized, and many responsibility systems were simply stipulated by administration; the work of uniting technical personnel and staff was not done well, and the determination of their responsibilities was ignored; the main cadres relaxed leadership over basic construction work and did not realize that poor basic construction would affect the continued development of production. Therefore, in the implementation of the production responsibility system, there was an unbalanced phenomenon, and some even became a mere formality, especially the technical responsibility system and the responsibility system for basic construction lagging behind the production responsibility system of on-site workers. But more importantly, the industrial departments and the leadership of industrial and mining enterprises have not yet established the necessary responsibility system for business management, which affects the failure to implement the production responsibility system of workshops and individuals.

    How to further implement the production responsibility system in the future? The editorial pointed out the following points:

    1.  It is necessary to educate cadres to recognize that the establishment of a production responsibility system is an important step in improving production management, increasing labor productivity, and implementing economic accounting; otherwise, it will bring disaster to the national industry and is a crime. At present, the first thing is to continue to implement the quality and safety responsibility system, and at the same time establish and strengthen the business management responsibility system and the technical responsibility system. To this end, it is necessary to earnestly implement the policy of further uniting technical personnel and staff, stipulate their job responsibilities and work systems, so that they have duties and powers in their work, so as to give play to their enthusiasm and creativity; formulate technical management systems, educate workers to abide by technical guidance, and, according to their possibilities and needs, mobilize technical personnel to go deep into the site and combine with the actual labor and production experience of workers.

    2.  The implementation of the responsibility system must be combined with the democratization of management to achieve results. When the responsibility system is established, the masses should be fully mobilized to actively participate in exposing the phenomenon of no one being responsible, and discuss and formulate various rules and regulations; after the responsibility system is established, the masses should be mobilized to consciously abide by and implement mass supervision. Only a responsibility system based on democracy will not become a mere formality.

    3.  Regular and in-depth inspection work and timely rewards and punishments are important keys to ensuring and consolidating the production responsibility system. In order to ensure the regularity of inspection work, it is necessary to formulate some specific work systems and regulations, such as regular meetings, reporting systems, summary systems, handover systems, notification systems, reward and punishment regulations, etc. When carrying out inspection work, the leadership must be combined with the masses, find problems, investigate responsibilities; discover and cultivate good models, and combine with the promotion of the Ma Hengchang group's experience. When implementing rewards and punishments, rewards should be the main focus, and special attention should be paid to not arbitrarily setting fines.

    4.  Promoting the contract system is an important method for implementing the responsibility system. Through the form of a contract, the responsibilities of both parties can be specified more specifically, mutual supervision can be achieved, and the erroneous thinking of some employees who "only care about themselves and not the whole" can be overcome. Therefore, on the basis of establishing a responsibility system, the contract system should be widely promoted.

    5.  The implementation of the responsibility system should be combined with strengthening the labor discipline of employees. Only by educating employees to consciously abide by technical guidance and safety, technology and other regulations can the implementation of the responsibility system be guaranteed. At the same time, the implementation of the responsibility system must also be combined with production competitions and innovation records, and combined with the current important policies in industrial production. Only in this way can the responsibility system be implemented well, and can economic construction be pushed forward.

### 东北日报发表社论号召  东北国营各工厂矿山大力贯彻生产责任制

　　东北日报发表社论号召  东北国营各工厂矿山大力贯彻生产责任制
    【本报讯】东北日报于八月二十七日发表“进一步贯彻生产责任制”的社论。该文首先肯定了自从东北工业部发出关于建立生产责任制、开展保安大检查运动及保证与提高产品质量等决定以来的成绩。同时指出在贯彻生产责任制上还存在很多问题。这表现在：有些厂矿的保安工作虽有改进，但还不是根本好转。如阜新煤矿第二季重伤和死亡虽比第一季减少，但仍死亡六名，重伤三十四名，轻伤一五三名，且事故次数反比第一季增多百分之十八点四。抚顺煤矿及各工厂四月份发生事故三四二次，五月份虽减为一三二次，但大部仍为责任事故。在保证质量方面：最严重的是基本建设工程质量低劣，国家损失极大。据工业部统计，仅红砖、石绵瓦、木材三项，因质量不好所遭受的直接损失即达八千余亿元（东北币下同）。至于因建筑材料低劣，所引起的基本建设工程的质量低劣，给予国家的损失则更大。此外，因领导上计划设计错误，而造成的浪费也很严重。如安东冶炼厂修建浪头水源地，因领导上不重视和技术指导错误，反工四、五次；建筑大石桥仓库时，房架立起后，全部塌下来，压伤了工人，摔坏了房架。其他如砖墙砌成凸背，砖缝竟宽达三、四十毫米的情况很多。在生产方面：机器六厂的废品率比五月份增加百分之一点二九，工具厂增加了百分之五点三五，汽车总厂的立式钻床和台床仍是三、四级品，纺织一厂不合规格的布匹占百分之七十。
    社论进一步分析了上述现象产生的原因：主要是由于有些厂矿领导干部对建立生产责任制的重要性认识不足，缺乏领导与检查，有的甚至把建立生产责任制和完成生产任务对立起来，贯彻中又未充分发动群众，把许多责任制度简单的由行政规定；对团结技术人员和职员的工作做得不够，忽略对他们职责的确定；主要干部对基本建设工作放松领导，没有认识到基本建设搞不好，将影响生产的继续发展，因而在贯彻生产责任制中，出现了不平衡的现象，有的甚至于流于形式，特别是技术责任制和基本建设方面的责任制落后于现场工人的生产责任制。但更重要的是由于工业部门及工矿企业领导中还没有建立起必要的经营管理方面的责任制，这就影响到车间与个人生产责任制未能很好贯彻。
    今后如何进一步贯彻生产责任制呢？社论指出下列几点：
    一、要教育干部认清建立生产责任制是改进生产管理，提高劳动生产率，贯彻经济核算制的重要步骤；否则，便给国家工业招来奇灾大祸，便是犯罪。在目前，首先是把质量和保安责任制继续贯彻下去，同时把经营管理的责任制和技术责任制建立并加强。为此就必须认真执行进一步团结技术人员和职员的政策，规定他们的工作职责与工作制度，使他们在工作上有职有权，以发挥他们的积极性和创造性；制订技术管理制度，教育工人遵从技术指导，并可根据其可能与需要，发动技术人员深入现场，与工人的实际劳动和生产经验相结合。
    二、贯彻责任制必须与管理民主化相结合，才能收到效果。责任制建立时，要充分发动群众积极参加揭发无人负责的现象，讨论制订各种制度规章；责任制建立后，要发动群众自觉地遵守和实行群众监督。只有建立在民主基础上的责任制，才不致流于形式。
    三、经常深入的检查工作和及时进行奖惩，是保证和巩固生产责任制的重要关键。为保证检查工作的经常，要制订一些具体工作制度和条例，如定期会议、汇报制度、总结制度、交班制度、通报制度、奖惩条例等。检查工作时领导必须与群众相结合，发现问题，追究责任；发现和培养好的典型，和推广马恒昌小组经验相结合。执行奖惩时，应以奖励为主，特别注意不要乱订罚则。
    四、推行合同制是贯彻责任制的重要方法。通过合同的形式可以更具体的规定双方的责任，可以达到互相监督，可以克服某些职工“只顾个人，不管整体”的错误思想。所以在建立责任制的基础上，应广泛推行合同制。
    五、贯彻责任制要和加强职工劳动纪律相结合，只有教育职工自觉的遵从技术指导和保安、技术等规程，才能保证责任制的贯彻。同时贯彻责任制还必须与生产竞赛和创新纪录相结合，和工业生产中当前的重要政策相结合，只有这样，才能将责任制实行得好，才能把经济建设向前推进一步。
