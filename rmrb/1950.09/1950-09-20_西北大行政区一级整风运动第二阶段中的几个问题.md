　　Several Issues in the Second Stage of the Rectification Movement in the Northwest Grand Administrative Area
    Ye Xin

    I. Several Links in Solving Problems

    The purpose of rectification is to improve cadres and improve work. This is also the clear goal of solving problems. To solve problems, we must thoroughly examine the shortcomings and errors that have arisen in our implementation of the Party's basic policies and major work tasks, analyze the nature of these shortcomings and errors, pursue their roots in ideology and systems, thereby improve thinking, improve work style, and establish and improve reasonable work systems and work relationships to ensure the smooth progress of future work and avoid these errors, shortcomings, and repetitions. This is a unified process of improvement and betterment; lacking any link, the purpose of rectification cannot be fully achieved.

    But so far, some study units are not clear enough about this principle. The Industry Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee is an example.

    In the rectification movement, through examining work and discussing problems, the Industry Department has improved the policy and ideological level of its cadres to a certain extent, and some improvements have also been made in its work. This is the main aspect. But one cannot ignore one shortcoming, that in the examination of past work, the focus has been on discussing and analyzing these tasks themselves; but not enough has been done to closely combine them with current work tasks and to formulate specific methods for improving work in the future. This is reflected in the fact that, whether in exposing problems or solving problems, many people have mentioned that the department's work guidelines are not clear, the relationships are unreasonable, and the systems are not sound. These are indeed key issues within the Industry Department and are also issues that most cadres are eager to resolve.

    But throughout the rectification process, these issues have not been given due discussion, or even due attention. As a result, there has been no corresponding improvement in the specific work of the department. Therefore, many comrades believe that the rectification has not been very effective. Until recently, when the department's rectification was basically over, the discussion of specific ways to improve work was started to make up for the above-mentioned defects.

    This shows that in the specific examination of a certain work, it is necessary not only to deeply review and analyze to elevate understanding to general ideological issues and style issues; at the same time, according to the needs of future work, it is necessary to formulate methods to improve work, establish and improve various necessary work systems, and rational work relationships to consolidate the achievements of the work inspection. If we simply solve the so-called ideological problems, the work cannot be guaranteed to be effectively improved.

    Experience proves that in the rectification movement, the leadership must clearly grasp the direction of the rectification and the main problems existing in the department, as well as the clear goals to be achieved in solving these problems; otherwise, it will be passive, blind, and lose its direction. The leadership of the Industry Department's rectification was not good enough in this regard, and therefore the above shortcomings arose. The Industry Department's rectification leadership initially determined that the examination of several major tasks was basically correct, but it did not have a good grasp of what problems to solve by examining these tasks. In the process of rectification, the leadership lacked timely research on the situation, analyzed the problems, and combined the needs of the masses, so that the problems could be solved correctly and completely. Therefore, this rectification did not achieve the due effect.

    However, this does not mean that solving problems can be done without improving ideology, or only by relying on the system. In fact, in some departments of the first-level organs in the Northwest Region, there is still another tendency. For example, the rectification is entangled in solving the transactional problems of a department, or trapped in the problems of cadres disagreeing with each other and being ununited; some have not gone through a deep examination of past work, nor have they made a specific analysis of the current actual conditions, and simply formulated some system regulations; regardless of whether these regulations meet actual needs and whether they are feasible, they are considered to have solved the problem. Undoubtedly, adopting this method of solving problems cannot achieve the purpose of improving cadres and improving work.

    II. Treat Criticism and Self-Criticism with a Correct Attitude

    At present, some comrades still have an incorrect attitude towards solving problems. The main manifestation is the lack of a spirit of criticism and self-criticism.

    It is obvious that to make solving problems truly achieve the purpose of improving cadres and improving work, it is impossible without carrying out full criticism and self-criticism. Only through full criticism and self-criticism can we find the crux of the problem, thoroughly expose the shortcomings and errors in ideology and work style, and come up with practical and effective methods to improve work.

    But in this regard, many agencies have not done very well. Generally speaking, there is still a lack of serious criticism between superiors and subordinates, and among each other. When discussing and analyzing problems, instead of taking a responsible attitude towards the work and boldly exposing errors and shortcomings, they adopt an attitude of appeasement and saying as little as possible. When it comes to themselves, instead of conducting a deep review and seeking improvement in ideology and work style, they adopt a passive and perfunctory attitude. Here is just one example: In the Northwest Military and Political Committee's Labor Department, when a responsible comrade of a certain section wrote a written review of his shortcomings during the exposure of problems, he was very embarrassed. He put down his pen halfway through, sighed, and said, "I don't know if writing it this way will meet everyone's requirements!"

    This lack of criticism and self-criticism shows that some of our comrades still do not have a sufficient understanding of the spirit of this rectification movement, and thus intentionally or unintentionally believe that solving problems is only for others, so they take an attitude of "getting through" and simply meeting everyone's requirements. Of course, this attitude is not beneficial to work, comrades, or oneself.

    Generally speaking, the reason why criticism and self-criticism cannot be carried out normally lies in the leadership. According to the situation in the first-level organs in the Northwest Region during the rectification movement: wherever the leadership can deeply review themselves in connection with the main work, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism is strong, and the rectification mood is active; if the leadership lacks criticism and self-criticism, the following will produce two moods: one is a passive attitude of "say as little as possible" and "let it go"; the other is to take an激愤激愤 [激愤jīfèn stirred up; aroused] attitude, criticizing often one-sidedly and excessively, or even to vent their anger. Undoubtedly, such rectification is impossible to solve the problem in depth.

    III. What Counts as Solving a Problem

    Some comrades have an incomplete view of what counts as solving a problem, and need to be pointed out and paid attention to. For example, some people believe that only punishment is solving a problem. A comrade with a certain leadership responsibility in the Xi'an Masses Daily has acted for personal gain. During the rectification, many people made comments. This comrade made a relatively serious reflection at the conference, and the newspaper's leadership announced that the matter would be handed over to the Northwest Bureau's Discipline Inspection Committee for handling; but some people still believe that the problem has not been solved; because this comrade has not "rolled down from the leadership position." Similarly, some people think that the rectification has not solved the problem because the problem is not solved to their satisfaction, or because their opinions are not completely correct and cannot be solved. There are also people who demand the so-called "thorough" solution to the problem, that is, regardless of the actual conditions, whether it can be done, or to what extent it can be done, they demand that everything be changed well at once, and changed to an "ideal degree," otherwise it is not solving the problem, or not completely solving the problem.

    Of course, these views are one-sided and incorrect. Because rectification is to improve thinking and correct shortcomings, not simply punish; it is to solve the problems that need to be solved and can be solved in our work, among which the main ones are important issues regarding the implementation of the Party's basic policies and major work tasks, and not to solve all the problems regardless of their importance and whether it is possible.

    Of course, this does not mean that only some problems are solved, and other problems that have been exposed and can be solved are not solved; but it is necessary to distinguish between the importance and urgency, and solve them as much as possible in different ways according to needs and possibilities. Here, any excuses or delays in solving problems are incorrect.

　　西北大行政区一级整风运动第二阶段中的几个问题
    也辛
    一、解决问题的几个环节
    整风的目的是提高干部，改进工作。这也就是解决问题的明确目标。解决问题，就是要彻底检查我们在执行党的基本政策和主要工作任务中所产生的缺点和错误，分析这些缺点错误的性质，追求它在思想和制度等方面产生的根源，从而提高思想，改进作风，并建立和健全合理的工作制度和工作关系，以保证今后工作的顺利进行，并避免这些错误、缺点和重犯。这是一个统一的提高和改进的过程，缺乏任何一个环节，就不能完满的达到整风的目的。
    但到目前为止，有些学习单位对这一原则，还是不够明确的。西北军政委员会工业部就是如此。
    工业部在整风中，经过检查工作，讨论问题，使干部的政策思想水平有了一定程度的提高，工作上也曾有了一些改进，这是主要方面。但有一个不可忽视的缺点，就是在检查过去的几件工作中，主要是局限在对这些工作本身进行讨论分析；而对于密切结合当前的工作任务，订出今后改进工作的具体办法，却作得不够，这表现在：不论在暴露问题或解决问题中，好多人都提到部里工作方针不明确、关系不合理、制度不健全等问题，这在工业部内部工作中确是带有关键性的重要问题，也是大多数干部急于要求解决的问题。
    但在整个整风过程中，对这些问题却没有展开应有的讨论。甚至没有给以应有的注意。结果，自然在部的具体工作方面，就得不到应有的改进。因此好多同志认为整风作用不大。直至最近，该部整风已经基本结束，为了弥补上述缺陷，才又讨论具体改进工作的办法。
    这就说明，在具体检查某项工作时，不但要深入检讨、分析，提高到一般的思想问题、作风问题上去认识；同时，要根据今后工作需要，定出改进工作的方法，建立和健全各种必要的工作制度，和合理的工作关系，把检查工作的成果巩固下来。假若只是单纯的解决所谓思想问题，工作就不能有保证的得到切实的改进。
    经验证明：在整风运动中，领导上一定要清醒的掌握整风的方向和本部门存在的主要问题，以及解决这些问题所要达到的明确目标；不然就会被动、盲目，而迷失方向。工业部整风领导上在这方面是做得不够的，因此产生了上面的缺点。工业部整风领导最初确定检查的几件主要工作，基本上是正确的，但对通过检查这些工作，解决些什么问题，却没有很好掌握。在整风进行中，领导上又缺乏及时的研究情况，分析问题，结合群众的需要，使问题获得正确、完满的解决，因此这次整风就没有收到应有的效果。
    但是这也绝不是说解决问题就可以不提高思想，或只靠制度办事。事实上，目前在西北区一级机关某些部门中，还存在另一种倾向。如把整风纠缠在解决一个部门的事务性问题上，或陷到干部彼此闹意见，不团结等问题中；有的并没有经过对过去工作的深刻检查，也没对当前的实际条件作具体分析，就简单的订出一些制度条文；不管这些条文是否切合实际需要，以及是否切实可行，就认为是解决了问题。无疑的，采取这种方式解决问题也不可能达到提高干部、改进工作的目的。
    二、以正确态度对待批评与自我批评
    目前，有些同志对解决问题所采取的态度还是不正确的。主要表现在缺乏批评与自我批评的精神。
    十分明显，要使解决问题真正能达到提高干部、改进工作的目的，不展开充分的批评与自我批评是不行的。只有通过充分的批评与自我批评，才能找出问题的症结所在，才能深入揭发思想作风上的缺点和错误，才能得出切实有效的改进工作的方法。
    但在这一方面，好多机关都是做得不很好的。一般的说，上下、彼此间还缺乏认真的批评空气。在讨论、分析问题时，不是抱对工作负责的态度，大胆的揭发错误和缺点，而是采取息事宁人、少说为佳的态度。在涉及自己的时候，不是深刻的检讨，求得思想作风上的改进，而是采取一种被动的应付的态度。这里只举一个例子：西北军政委员会劳动部在暴露问题中，一个处的负责同志，在对自己的缺点写书面检讨的时候，十分为难，中途把笔一放，长叹一声说：“这样写出来，不知道能不能达到大家的要求呵！”
    这种缺乏批评与自我批评的态度，说明我们有些同志对这次整风的精神还认识不足，因而有意无意的认为解决问题只是为了别人，于是抱“过关”的态度，单纯的去满足大家的要求。当然这种态度对工作、对同志、对自己都是没有好处的。
    一般的说，批评与自我批评所以不能正常的展开，关键在于领导。根据西北区一级机关整风中的情况看：凡是领导上能结合主要工作，深刻的检讨自己的，批评与自我批评的空气就浓厚，整风情绪就活跃；领导上缺乏批评与自我批评的，下边就会产生两种情绪：一种是“少说为佳”“随它去吧”的消极态度；一种是采取一种激愤的态度，批评起来往往片面过火，甚至为了泄愤。无疑的，这样的整风是不可能深入的解决问题的。
    三、怎样才算解决问题
    对于怎样才算解决了问题，有些同志还有不够全面的看法，需要提出加以注意。如有人认为只有惩办才是解决问题。西安群众日报社一位负有一定领导责任的同志，有假公济私的行为。整风中好多人提了意见，这位同志在大会上作了比较认真的反省，报社领导上并宣布把这件事交西北局纪律检查委员会处理；但有人仍认为没有解决问题；因为这位同志还没有“从领导岗位上滚下来”。类似的也有人因为问题解决得不满自己的意，或因自己的意见不完全正确，得不到解决，就认为整风没有解决问题。还有人要求所谓“彻底的”解决问题，就是不管实际条件如何，能不能办到，或办到怎样的程度，要求一下子把什么都改变好，并且改变到“理想的程度”，不然就不是解决问题，或不是完全解决问题。
    当然，这些意见都是片面的、不正确的。因为整风是为了提高思想，改正缺点，而不是简单的惩办；是解决我们工作中的需要解决并可能解决的问题，其中主要的又是关于执行党的基本政策和主要工作任务方面的重要问题，而不是不分轻重、不分可能与否，去解决所有的问题。
    当然，这也不是说：只解决某些问题，其他已经暴露并可能解决的问题也不去解决；而是要分清轻重缓急，根据需要与可能，以不同的方式尽可能的予以解决。在这里任何借口、拖延，不解决问题，都是不正确的。
