　　Neglecting Factory Safety Work
    Letter of Self-Criticism from Qinghe Woolen Mill

To the Editor:

　　After the publication of Comrade Su Ren's letter criticizing our mill for "neglecting factory safety regulations" in the People's Forum on September 4th, we convened the Management Committee for a self-examination. The main reasons for the continuous accidents in our factory, from the perspective of leadership, are as follows:

    I. Complacency. Although higher authorities and newspapers have repeatedly emphasized the importance of factory safety, and Soviet experts also raised this issue during their visit, we paid very little attention to it in this regard, and our education for workers was also insufficient. It was not until the Liu Shirong incident that it aroused everyone's attention.

    II. Lack of concern for workers' lives. We have not summarized the experiences regarding factory safety to make them into safety regulations and systems. Only after the Liu Shirong incident did we convene a meeting of foremen and safety team members. After discussion by workers and approval by the Management Committee, we formulated factory-wide safety rules.

    III. Procrastination, which is why we did not handle the aftermath of the accidents promptly. After accepting safety suggestions from various parties, we failed to implement them quickly, which prevented the factory's safety work from becoming a mass movement, leading to continuous accidents.

    This is a painful lesson, which we should deeply understand and remember. Regarding the aftermath of Comrade Liu Shirong's death, we allocated 1260 jin of millet as Liu's funeral expenses and allocated half of his monthly salary to his family as a pension for a period of ten years.

### 忽视工厂安全工作  清河制呢厂来信检讨

　　忽视工厂安全工作
    清河制呢厂来信检讨编辑同志：
    九月四日人民园地发表了苏任同志批评本厂“忽视工厂安全条例”的信后，我们召开了管委会，进行了检讨。我们工厂之所以连续发生事故，从领导上来检查，主要有以下三个原因：
    一、思想麻痹。上级机关和报纸虽曾一再强调注意工厂安全工作，苏联专家来此参观时亦曾提出这个问题，但我们在这方面注意得很差，对工人同志的教育也不够。直到刘士荣事件发生后才引起大家的重视。
    二、不关心工人生活。关于工厂安全的经验，我们都没有把它总结起来，使它成为安全条例和安全制度。刘士荣同志事件发生以后，我们才召开了工长会议，安全组员会议，经过工人讨论与管委会通过，制订了全厂的安全规则。
    三、工作拖拉，因此在事故发生以后，我们没有及时处理。对各方面的安全建议，接受后不能迅速付诸实施，这样就不能使工厂的保安工作成为群众性的工作，以致事故连续发生。
    这是一个惨痛的教训，我们应该深刻的领会和记取。对刘士荣同志的善后问题，我们拨出小米一千二百六十斤作为刘的丧葬费，并按其每月工资的半数拨给他的家属作为恤金，期限为十年。
