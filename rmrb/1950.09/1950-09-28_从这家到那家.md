　　From This House to That House...
    (Soviet Union·Bizeminssiji)
    I took a bundle of the Stockholm Appeal from the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and collected signatures for peace on a street in Moscow.
    Comrades working in factories, offices, and schools had already signed at their workplaces. Therefore, I prepared to visit those who were not working anywhere: the elderly parents of Soviet citizens, housewives and female workers, those receiving pensions, and those on sick leave.
    In the first house I visited, I was welcomed like a dear guest. I was led into the dining room. The women in the house hurried to tidy up and put a "festive tablecloth" on the table. Then the hostess, Maria Petrovna Konovalova, solemnly said:
    "Now, it's ready."
    Maria Petrovna was the first to sign.
    She put her glasses in her pocket and said to me, "Thank you, Comrade. Please tell everyone that we mothers can extinguish war with our own hands!"
    She stared at her working hands, which had operated a loom for many years.
    ...At the entrance of the second house, three elementary school girls and an old woman were waiting for me.
    "Please come here, come here!" they eagerly invited me.
    "No," the old woman said quietly, "You should come to my place first..." She added, "My husband and son both died in the war..." There were no tears in her voice—only a stern and firm tone. The schoolgirls made way. So, the second signature was obtained.
    The people in this building all knew I was coming. I didn't need to ring the doorbell; the doors of every household upstairs opened by themselves.
    In house number eight, there seemed to be many people. Some guests had just arrived from Siberia—cheerful, strong, and broad-shouldered people.
    They shook my hand and led me into a large room. A large table was prepared in the room, with a large vase of flowers on it. The hostess, Maria Semenovna Golyayeva, stood by the table. She briefly told me about her life, which was itself a poem of the socialist country. Maria Semenovna was formerly a poor worker, a proletarian, in a candy factory. In the early years of the Soviet regime, she and her husband—a cutter—studied culture together, worked in the factory, and served as members of the district Soviet of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies. Her children—an engineer, a pilot, a head nurse, a painter, a lathe operator, and a medical student. They were able to achieve this only because the socialist motherland provided them with full opportunities to study, work, and grow. The twelve-year-old daughter, Lisa—one of the three schoolgirls who waited for me on the stairs—was still studying at school.
    "Please take these eleven signatures," she said finally, "We are ordinary people, but our signatures have some significance. May the working people of the world be happy, and may our enemies be distressed!"
    ...In house number twelve, Stepan Severyev, a disabled veteran of the First World War, signed.
    "I know you," he said, "You are a writer. You have written poems about how the power and will of the people are more powerful than the atomic bomb. Now, write a poem like this: Truman has the atomic bomb and wants to drop it on everyone who opposes his policies, while we, who have mastered the secret of atomic energy production, are leading a nationwide movement to ban atomic weapons."
    "Well, I want to write a poem about your signing the peace declaration," I suggested, "Your signature is the best poetic creation for the topic you raised, isn't it?"
    ...In house number fourteen, a comrade who was temporarily bedridden due to illness didn't let me leave for a long time.
    "I am a miner," he said, "and now a student at a mining vocational school. Please believe me, I am a humble person. But I very much desire that my signature on the peace declaration will be published in the newspaper. Perhaps, a miner in France will receive this newspaper, and then he will see that there is also a miner Morozov who supports peace along with him, a Stakhanovite worker from Donbas, a future engineer, and an ordinary soldier in the Soviet miners' peace ranks. I really like the heroic struggle of the French miners! Therefore, when they let me choose a foreign language, I chose French. If I could meet a French miner, maybe we could talk to each other in broken French. However, there is no need to speak, we will understand each other, because we are talking about friendship, peace, and comradely love."
    ...I went from this house to that house. I didn't need to mobilize anyone—they were all waiting for me.
    I came out of the last house. All the signatures were collected without exception! However, the word "collect" is very inaccurate in this case; the signatures were submitted by each person themselves.
    At the entrance, Ilya Borisovich Minkin, a resident of house number seven, ran into me.
    He suddenly stopped.
    "Please tell me," he said, "When did Comrade Stalin sign?"
    "I don't know," I replied, looking into his eyes, "I think his signature is when you signed. You and I both know that Comrade Stalin stands with anyone who fights for the cause of peace, for the happiness of all working people."
    "Comrade Stalin signs together with all the people, and the people sign together with Stalin."
    The happiness that flickered in Ilya Borisovich's eyes requires a long poem to describe.
    In our country, in the Soviet Union, hundreds of millions of signatures have been collected.
    In every country around the world, hundreds of millions of signatures have also been collected.
    The people who signed the Stockholm Appeal have united into a powerful force, united into an unconquerable will. In front of this force, in front of this will, the warmongers are powerless!
    Peace will triumph!

### 从这家到那家……

　　从这家到那家……
    苏联·比则民斯）
    我拿了世界保卫和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩宣言一束，在莫斯科的一条大街上，征集和平签名。
    那些在工厂、机关及学校中工作的同志们，已经在他们的工作地点签了名。因此我准备访问那些不在任何地方工作的人们：苏联公民的高龄的双亲，家庭主妇和女工，那些领年金的以及因病休假的人们。
    在我所访问的第一家，我受到亲爱的客人一般的欢迎。把我接进了饭厅。妇女们在屋子里急忙收拾一下，拿了“节日的桌布”铺在桌上。然后女主人玛丽亚·彼特罗夫娜·科诺瓦洛娃郑重地说：
    “现在，可以了”。
    玛丽亚·彼特罗夫娜第一个签了名。
    她把眼镜放进了衣袋，便向我说：“谢谢你，同志。请转告大家，我们做母亲的人们，是能够亲手熄灭战争的！”
    她定睛看看自己劳动的手掌，这双手管理织布机已有多年了。
    ……第二家门口，有三个小学女生和一位老太太正等候着我。
    “请到我们这里来，到我们这里来吧！”她们争先恐后地邀请我。
    “不要，”老太太静悄悄地说：“您还是先来我这儿吧……”她再加一句：“我的丈夫和儿子都是在战争中死了……”她的声音里没有泪——那一种又严峻又坚定的声音。女学生让开了道路。于是第二个签了名。
    这座房子中的人们，全都知道我来了。我用不着再按门铃，楼上每户的门都自己打开了。
    在第八号住宅，人好像很多。从西伯利亚刚刚来到了一些客人，愉快的、健壮的、阔肩膀的人们。
    他们和我握握手，把我接到一个大房间中去。屋中准备好一张大桌子，桌上有一大瓶花。女主人玛丽亚·谢美诺夫娜·高梁耶娃站在桌子旁。她向我简略地谈到她的生活，这生活本身就是社会主义国家的一首诗篇。玛丽亚·谢美诺夫娜先前本是糖果工厂的穷苦工人，无产者。在苏维埃政权的最初几年里，她和丈夫——削截工人——一同学习了文化，在工厂中作工，并做了区工农代表苏维埃的委员。她的孩子们——一个工程师，一个飞行员，一个女护士长，一个画家，一个旋工，一个医科大学学生。他们能够如此，只是因为社会主义祖国使他们得到了学习、工作和生长的充分可能性。十二岁的小女儿丽萨——在楼梯上等候我的三个女学生之一——还在学校中读书。
    “请你把这十一个签名带去，”她最后说：“我们是普通人，但我们的签名是有些意义的。愿全世界的劳动人民幸福，让我们的敌人苦恼吧！”
    ……在第十二号住宅，第一次世界大战的残废军人斯契潘·色维列夫签了名。
    “我认识你，”他说：“你是一个作家。你写过关于人民的力量和意志比原子弹更有力的诗句。现在，你写一首这样的诗吧：杜鲁门有了原子弹，想把它投向一切反对他的政策的人们，而我们，掌握了原子能制造的秘密，却领导着禁止原子武器的全民运动。”
    “呃，我要写一首关于你在和平宣言上签名的诗”，我提议说：“你的签名对于你所提出的题目就是最好的诗创作，可不是吗？”
    ……在第十四号住宅中，有一位暂时因病躺在床上的同志，他很长时间不放我走。
    “我是一个矿工，”他说，“而现在是矿业专门学校的大学生。请相信我，我是一个谦逊的人。但是我非常渴望我在和平宣言上的签名会登在报上。也许，法国的某一个矿工会得到这份报纸，那么他就会看到和他一齐拥护和平的有矿工马罗佐夫，顿巴斯的斯塔哈诺夫工作者，未来的工程师，苏联矿工和平队伍的普通战士。我非常喜欢法国矿工的英勇斗争！因此，当他们让我选修一门外国语的时候，我选了法文。如果我能够遇到一个法国矿工，也许我们可以用法语似懂非懂地互相谈谈吧。不过，用不着说话，我们也会彼此了解的，因为我们说的都是友爱、和平和同志般的爱的话。”
    ……我从这家走到那家。我用不着鼓动任何人——他们都在等候我。
    我从最后的一家走出。签名毫无例外地全部征集起来了！但是，“征集”这个字在这种情况下很不确切，签名是各人自己投来的。
    在大门口，第七号住宅的居民伊里亚·包里索维奇·明金碰见了我。
    他忽然站住了。
    “请你告诉我，”他说，“斯大林同志是什么时候签的名？”
    “不知道，”我回答说，一边看着他的眼睛，“我想，他的签名正是你签名的时候。你我都知道，斯大林同志是和任何一个为和平事业，为全体劳动者的幸福而斗争的人站在一起的。”
    “斯大林同志和全体人民一道签名，人民也和斯大林一道签名”。
    伊里亚·包里索维奇眼中闪铄着这样的幸福，需要一首长诗来描写。
    在我国，在苏联，成亿成万人的签名征集起来了。
    全世界各个国家中，成亿成万人的签名也征集起来了。
    在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人们，团结成一支强大的力量，团结成一个不能克服的意志。在这支力量前面，在这个意志前面，战争贩子们是无力的！
    和平一定会胜利！
      （君强译自《和平拥护者》第十四期）
