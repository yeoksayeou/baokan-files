The Struggle of African Youth
An Interview with African Representative Momoni

On the afternoon of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation's arrival in Beijing, we began our conversation with Momoni in a spirit of brotherly friendship.

We started by discussing the cruel rule, exploitation, and oppression of the imperialists in Africa:

"After the Second World War, the political consciousness of the oppressed people generally increased, and national independence movements surged forward. People from all over Africa organized mass organizations and political groups from 1946 onwards. In November and December 1947, representatives from various regions gathered in Bamako for a National Representative Conference. At the conference, different groups and parties were unified, and the unified 'African People's Democratic Alliance' was established to lead the African people's movement for independence and liberation. At the same time, the conference decided on many important programs and general guidelines for future actions. Since then, this movement has expanded day by day. By 1948, the number of members had grown to one million, which attracted the attention of France, which implemented unreasonable and tyrannical oppression. Despite this, our movement continued to develop in every corner.

"Since France joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it began to accept orders from its American masters and the Marshall Plan, particularly strengthening its oppression of the colonies, demanding that we send troops and use our naval ports as air and naval bases.

"As a result of the cruel oppression and exploitation by imperialism, the lives of the African people have fallen into a very painful situation. All the income they earn from their hard work, after most of it is exploited and plundered by imperialism, is hardly enough to maintain their minimum standard of living. Therefore, they eat poorly, generally suffer from malnutrition, have many diseases, and the mortality rate is increasing. This is the Africa of today under the trampling of imperialism!"

However, the African people are not willing to be slaves forever, especially the younger generation, Momoni continued:

"Young people occupy a very important position in the African people's liberation movement because they suffer the most severe oppression. Only about five percent of African children are able to receive education. The others are forced to start working from the age of twelve or thirteen. Because they are the most oppressed, their level of awareness is also the highest. When the 'African People's Democratic Alliance' was first established, young members accounted for half of the membership.

"The youth organization in Africa is the 'African Democratic Youth Alliance,' which is directly under the leadership of the 'African People's Democratic Alliance.' This organization has only been established for a year, but it has already done a lot of work, such as running literacy night schools, leading young people in demonstrations or armed uprisings against the arrest of patriotic leaders by the French imperialists.

"In the cultural field, young people do not give up their struggle either. The French imperialists force Africans to learn French, but we have launched a movement to organize our own culture, engage in the organization of literature, folk songs, dramas, legends, novels, etc., and some young people are engaged in the writing of folk art."

Finally, Momoni described his impressions of his two weeks in New China. He was deeply moved by the high degree of enthusiasm of Chinese youth in the cities, villages, factories, farms, and schools of Northeast China. He said, "This enthusiasm, especially for me as a colonial youth, is the most understandable, the most valued, and the most aware of its value."

He also said that the victory of the Chinese people is a great encouragement not only to the Asian people but also to the African people. Momoni said: "Therefore, the victory of the Chinese people is also our victory because it has helped us, encouraged us, strengthened our confidence, and made us more united and persistent in our struggle!"

    非洲青年的斗争
    访问非洲代表摩摩尼
    在世界民主青年联盟代表团来到北京当天的下午，坐在摩摩尼的房间里，我们完全以兄弟般的友情开始谈话了。
    我们先从帝国主义者们在非洲的残酷统治、剥削和压榨谈起：
    “在二次大战后，被压迫的人民的政治觉悟普遍提高，民族独立运动澎湃开展。非洲各地人民从一九四六年起组织了民众团体和政治团体，一九四七年十一、十二月，各地代表集中在巴麻哥地方举行了国民代表会议，会上统一了各个不同的团体和政党，成立了统一的‘非洲人民民主联盟’，领导着非洲人民的独立解放运动。同时会上决定许多重要的方案和今后行动的总方针。此后这一运动日益扩大，到一九四八年，盟员已发展到一百万人，因此引起了法国的注意，实行无理的横暴的压迫，虽然这样，我们的运动仍在各个角落里开展着。
    “自从法国加入了北大西洋公约之后，它开始接受美国主子的命令和马歇尔计划，特别加强对殖民地的压迫，要我们出兵，要利用我们的军港作为海空军根据地。
    “由于帝国主义残酷的压迫和剥削的结果，非洲人民生活已陷于非常苦痛的境地。他们辛辛苦苦工作所得的全部收入，除去大部分被帝国主义剥削、抢掠而外，剩下来的很难维持自己最低限度的生活。因此，他们吃得很坏，一般的营养不良，疾病多，死亡率日益增大。这就是在帝国主义蹂躏下的今日非洲！”
    但是，非洲人民是不甘心永远做奴隶下去的，特别是年青的一代，摩摩尼接着说：
    “青年们在非洲人民的解放运动中占了极重要的位置，因为他们所受的压迫最厉害。非洲儿童能够受到教育的不过百分之五，其他的，从十二三岁时就被迫着开始劳动，由于他们受压迫最重，所以觉悟程度也最高，当‘非洲人民民主联盟’初成立时，青年盟员占了一半。
    “非洲青年的组织为‘非洲民主青年联盟’，直接受‘非洲人民民主联盟’的领导。这个组织成立才只一年，却已做了很多工作，如办识字夜校、领导青年反对法帝逮捕爱国领袖而游行示威或者武装暴动。
    “在文化领域中，青年们也不放弃他们的斗争，法帝强迫非洲人学法文，但我们发起了整理我们自己文化的运动，从事文学民歌，戏剧，传说，小说等的整理，还有些青年们从事于民间文艺的写作。”
    最后，摩摩尼叙述了他来到新中国两星期来的感想，他在东北的城市、乡村、工厂、农场、学校里，使他深深感动的是中国青年高度的热情。他说：“这种热情，特别对作为一个殖民地青年的我来说是最了解，最重视，也最知道它的价值的。”
    他并说：中国人民的胜利，不仅是对亚洲人民、对非洲人民也同样是一个极大的鼓励。摩摩尼说：“因此，中国人民的胜利，也正是我们的胜利，因为它帮助了我们，鼓舞了我们，加强了我们的信心，使我们更加团结，坚持斗争！”（附图片）
