    Over Ten Million Mu of Cotton Fields Expected to Have a Bumper Harvest
    [This newspaper's dispatch] According to the "Liberation Daily" news: Over ten million mu of cotton fields in Shandong, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu and other places generally show signs of a bumper harvest.

    Following the bumper harvest of early rice, Southern Jiangsu's cotton this year can also complete the task of increasing production. The area of cotton planting in Southern Jiangsu this year was originally 2,565,862 mu, and the area has slightly decreased in some areas due to drought and flood disasters. The actual cotton field area is now 2,456,654 mu. However, due to the vigorous support and leadership of the people's government, farmers have been timely processing and applying fertilizer, eliminating pests, and lending a large amount of cotton seeds, fertilizers, and machinery. The Central People's Government has also stipulated a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio, and the propaganda of the land reform has greatly improved the cotton farmers' enthusiasm for production, coupled with timely rainfall. Therefore, although the cotton planting area has slightly decreased, it can still meet the requirements for increased production. According to existing statistical materials, in general areas planting Zhongmian cotton, the average yield of seed cotton per mu can reach 90 jin, equivalent to 30 jin of ginned cotton, exceeding the original planned requirement of 24 jin of Zhongmian cotton per mu. As for improved cotton, with 2,400 seedlings per mu, and each seedling bearing six bolls, with every 120 bolls equaling one jin of seed cotton, the yield of seed cotton per mu can reach 120 jin, equivalent to 40 jin of ginned cotton. Zhou Huiping, a cotton farmer in Tuanjie Township, Changyin District, Changshu, can produce 250 jin to 300 jin of seed cotton per mu. Based on this, it is estimated that Southern Jiangsu can produce 770,000 dan of ginned cotton this year, exceeding the original planned increase of 50,000 dan.
    Northern Jiangsu planted a total of 3,540,000 mu of cotton this year, an increase of more than 900,000 mu compared with last year. In order to promote fine cotton varieties, more than 260,000 mu of cotton fields were selected in Nantong, Rudong, and Taipei counties as pure Daizi cotton and Dezi cotton seed management areas. Currently, the cotton seedlings are growing vigorously and are generally blooming. The cotton seedlings in the purebred management areas are as high as three to four feet, with about 20 bolls per plant. Harvesting began in late September. If there are no accidents, the production increase plan can be completed (it is estimated that Northern Jiangsu will produce a total of 60.042 million jin of ginned cotton this year, an increase of 17.54 million jin compared with last year). The cotton-growing areas in Northern Jiangsu are all formed by beaches and are full of weeds. Moreover, the cotton-growing areas generally lack labor. Therefore, mobilizing weeding and solving the difficulty of labor are the keys to ensuring increased production. Under the leadership of the people's government, cotton farmers in various places first fully used the existing labor force, organized labor mutual aid, and mobilized people from outside areas to come to the cotton-growing areas to weed. Some areas also mobilized surplus labor in towns and townships, and troops stationed in the cotton-growing areas went to the fields to help weed the seedlings. The East China Military and Political Committee also allocated 15 million jin of rice to help cotton farmers solve the difficulties of lacking food rations and employing workers. As of the end of August, cotton fields throughout the region had generally been weeded four to five times, with the most reaching eight times, so the cotton seedlings are particularly strong.
    According to the first survey, the cotton planting area in Shandong Province this year was 5.33 million mu. Later, due to wind, hail, water, insects, and lack of seedlings, the cotton planting area decreased by about 3%. The province now has a total cotton field area of ​​5.15 million mu (originally planned 6 million mu). Although the cotton planting area has decreased, leaders at all levels have grasped the leadership of cotton farmers in cultivating, weeding, applying topdressing fertilizer, repairing cotton, removing insects, and preventing waterlogging. In addition, the rainfall this year is well distributed, and the cotton seedlings are growing well. Therefore, it is estimated that the province can produce 1.54 million dan of ginned cotton this year (93 jin of seed cotton per mu), close to completing the production task of 1.56 million dan of ginned cotton. Xinmian, one of the main cotton producing areas in the province, has begun to enter the market in Dezhou area. In order to protect the interests of cotton farmers, the local Huasha Cloth Branch has appropriately increased the market price of seed cotton and started purchasing.

### 山东、苏南、苏北等省区  千余万亩棉田可望丰收

　　山东、苏南、苏北等省区
    千余万亩棉田可望丰收
    【本报讯】据解放日报消息：山东、苏南、苏北等地千余万亩棉田，普呈丰收景象。
    继早稻丰收后，苏南今年棉花亦可完成增产任务。今年苏南植棉面积，原为二百五十六万五千八百六十二亩，部分地区因遭到旱涝等灾害面积略有减少，现在实际棉田面积为二百四十五万六千六百五十四亩。但由于人民政府大力扶助、领导农民及时加工施肥、扑灭虫害、贷放了大量棉种、肥料、药械，中央人民政府又规定了合理的棉粮比价，以及土地改革的宣传，使棉农生产情绪大为提高，加上天雨适时，因此，虽然植棉面积略有减少，而仍可达到增产要求。据现有材料统计，一般种植中棉的地区，平均每亩可收籽棉九十市斤，合皮棉三十市斤，超过原定计划每亩中棉产二十四市斤的要求。至于改良棉，每亩以留苗二千四百株，每株结六个铃，每一百二十个铃合一市斤籽棉计，则每亩可产籽棉一百二十斤，合皮棉四十市斤。常熟常阴区团结乡棉农周惠萍，每亩可产籽棉二百五十市斤到三百市斤之多。由此，估计今年苏南皮棉可产七十七万担，较原定增产计划要超过五万担。
    苏北今年共植棉三百五十四万亩，较去年扩大九十余万亩。并为推广优良棉种，特在南通、如东、台北等县选择棉田二十六万余亩，作为纯岱字棉、德字棉种管理区。现棉苗旺盛，普遍开花，纯种管理区棉苗高达三至四尺，每颗结铃二十个左右。至九月下旬已开始收花。如无意外，可以完成增产计划（全苏北预计今年共计产皮棉六千零四十二万斤，较去年增产一千七百五十四万斤）。苏北棉区均系海滩形成，杂草丛生。且棉区一般缺乏劳动力，故发动锄草、解决劳动力困难是保证增产的关键。各地棉农在人民政府领导下，首先充分使用已有劳力，组织劳动互助，并发动外区群众来棉区锄草，部分地区并动员市镇剩余劳力、驻棉区机关部队下田帮助锄苗。华东军政委员会并特拨大米一千五百万斤，帮助棉农解决缺乏口粮及雇工工资的困难。至八月底止，全区棉田已普遍锄过四至五遍，最多的达八遍，故棉苗特别壮旺。
    山东今年全省植棉面积，据第一次调查为五百三十三万亩，后由于风、雹、水、虫及缺苗等原因，植棉面积减少约百分之三，现全省实有棉田面积共五百一十五万亩（原计划六百万亩）。植棉面积虽减少，但各级领导上抓紧领导棉农中耕除草、施追肥、修棉、除虫、防涝等工作，加之今年雨水调和，棉苗生长较好，因此估计今年全省可产皮棉一百五十四万担（每亩产籽棉九十三斤），接近完成一百五十六万担皮棉的生产任务。该省主要产棉区之一德州地区新棉已开始上市，当地花纱布支公司，为保护棉农利益，已将籽棉市价适当提高，开始收购。
