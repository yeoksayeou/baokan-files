Short Commentary

　　The Central Committee of the Party’s decision on launching criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals states: “If the criticism published in newspapers and periodicals is entirely true, the criticized party should immediately declare acceptance in the same newspaper or periodical and announce the results of correcting the errors. If part of it is untrue, the criticized party should immediately make a factual correction in the same newspaper or periodical, and accept the correct part of the criticism. If the criticized party refuses to express its attitude, or retaliates against the critic, it should be dealt with by the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission. The parts of the above-mentioned matters that violate administrative discipline and laws should be handled by the state supervisory and judicial organs."
    Many of the criticisms published in this newspaper have been promptly responded to by those criticized, and many have met the requirements stipulated by the Party Central Committee as mentioned above. However, some of those criticized have not done so. They either respond very slowly, or their responses are not serious enough, or they have not responded at all. This is all very wrong.
    The purpose of open, mass criticism and self-criticism is to continuously improve the work of the Party and the government under the supervision of the masses. This is a method that revolutionary parties must pay special attention to in order to prevent and correct bureaucracy, and it is precisely a manifestation of being seriously responsible for the cause of the people. The criticized party should conduct a review based on correct criticism, formulate measures to improve work, earnestly implement them, and publish the results of the review and the measures to improve work. If there are any inaccuracies, factual corrections can also be made. In this way, there is no loss to the criticized party, but it will enhance the political prestige of the self-criticized, promote the improvement of the people's relevant undertakings, and also provide an important political education for the vast number of readers.
    We request that comrades who have been criticized by this newspaper and have not yet responded, respond quickly, so that the vast number of readers can specifically understand the great role of the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, so as to more widely carry out criticism and self-criticism, and more effectively promote our work.

　　应该认真答复批评
    党中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定中说：“批评在报纸刊物上发表后，如完全属实，被批评者应即在同一报纸刊物上声明接受并公布改正错误的结果，如有部分失实，被批评者应即在同一报纸刊物上作出实事求是的更正，而接受批评的正确部分。如被批评者拒绝表示态度，或对批评者加以打击，即应由党的纪律检查委员会予以处理。上述事情触犯行政纪律法律的部分，应由国家监察机关司法机关予以处理。”
    本报所发表的批评，很多已及时得到被批评者以答复，其中，很多已做到了上述的党中央所规定的要求。但也有些被批评者没有这样做，他们或者答复得很慢，或者答复得不够认真，或者还根本没有答复。这都是非常不应该的。
    公开的群众性的批评与自我批评的目的，在于使党与政府的工作能在群众的监督下不断改进。这是革命政党为了防止与纠正官僚主义所必须特别注意采取的方法，这正是对人民事业认真负责的表现。被批评者根据正确批评进行检讨，订出改进工作的办法，切实加以执行，并将检讨结果和改进工作的办法加以公布，如有不完全实在之处，也可以加以实事求是的更正。这样，对被批评者不但毫无损失，而且会提高自我批评者的政治威信，促进人民有关事业的改进，对于广大读者也是一种重要的政治教育。
    我们要求被本报批评尚未作答复的同志，迅速答复，使广大读者具体认识批评和自我批评这一武器的重大作用，以便更广泛地开展批评与自我批评，更有效地推进我们的工作。
