Xinhua News Agency, September 26th:

Among the representatives attending this National Conference of Combat Heroes are many heroes and model workers from ethnic minorities. They demonstrated outstanding revolutionary heroism in the struggle against the national oppression of the Kuomintang and for the independence of the motherland.

　　Twenty-three-year-old Mongolian youth, Tai Jiade, deputy chief of staff of a certain cavalry regiment, was awarded the title of combat hero in his first battle six months after joining the army in 1945. He has experienced more than 200 battles of various sizes. In the battle to liberate Qiqihar, as a cavalry instructor, he requested to participate in the assault group. He and his two comrades forced more than 120 enemies to surrender with four hand grenades. In the battle of Beida Wa in Siping Street in December 1947, this hero of the People's Cavalry once again waved his saber and led his iron cavalry into the enemy's formation, single-handedly cutting down more than 40 enemies and capturing five light and heavy machine guns and two 60mm mortars. Another Mongolian combat hero, Hao Telao, although he only participated in six or seven battles, has already been credited with three major merits, capturing and killing more than 30 enemies and seizing 24 guns. He also holds the honorary title of model worker. In his labor, he used his model worker actions to ensure that the class he led chopped 1,300 to 1,400 bundles of firewood every day. He has now been promoted to deputy platoon leader of a certain cavalry unit.

　　Combat hero Radonov of the Fifth Army of the People's Liberation Army (formerly the National Army of Xinjiang) was born into a poor Uyghur peasant family in Yili, Xinjiang. When the Xinjiang people's guerrillas attacked Yili City in November 1944, he selflessly helped the guerrillas and joined this Xinjiang people's armed force after the battle. This Uyghur youth established many merits with the rifle he captured from the enemy. In the Jinghe County campaign, he volunteered to take on the blasting mission. He led five comrades, braving the fire of five enemy machine guns, approached the enemy's碉堡 [diāobǎo, blockhouse], and finally destroyed three enemy碉堡 [diāobǎo, blockhouse], and he himself was wounded.

　　Another Uyghur youth, Kurbanov, who joined the Fifth Army only last November, and the "Kurbanov Assault Team" he led, are a shining banner of labor. When building the Yili Royal Canal, he dug 26.7 cubic meters of frozen earth in eight hours of labor. He was the first on the list of heroes of the Water Conservancy Construction Committee and was praised as an outstanding model worker of the Fifth Army.

　　Li combat hero Chen Liwen, who persisted in the arduous struggle behind enemy lines in Qiongya at the southernmost tip of the motherland, is an outstanding son and daughter of the thousands of heroic people of Qiongya. He joined the Qiongya Column of the People's Liberation Army in 1944, and since the autumn offensive launched in 1948, he has participated in eight assault battles, bravely completing his tasks each time. He has been gloriously wounded three times, but the blood shed by him and his many comrades has finally won the freedom and liberation of the people of Hainan Island.

　　The militia hero Wu Tiancai, who attended this National Conference of Combat Heroes, is an Axi nationality. He was originally a team member of a village defense team under the rule of the Kuomintang. He led more than 20 village defense team members in an armed uprising against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in Zhuyuan Town, Mile County, Yunnan Province, on a winter night in 1947. After that armed uprising, he then called on more than 80 Axi youths to join their ranks. This team of more than 100 people had fought with tens of thousands of puppet security forces, and had severely attacked a regiment of Kuomintang bandit troops besieging them in the great forest. Soon, they joined the Yunnan People's Armed Forces led by General Zhu Jiabi. In the attack on Guangnan County in 1948, Wu Tiancai crawled into the city from a sewer filled with mud and stinking water to meet the attacking troops and entered the city. He captured more than 50 prisoners alone in one night.

　　Another Yunnan militia hero, Lin Ziqing, is a Woni youth from Abaocu in the northern suburbs of Eshan County, Yunnan. The Abaocu area is inhabited by Woni compatriots, and this area is now the most successful in Eshan County's mass work, thanks to Lin Ziqing's efforts over the past two years. In early 1949, when Chiang Kai-shek's 26th Army arrived in their area, Lin Ziqing mobilized the masses to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, and organized the militia to completely seal off the village. The enemy could not figure out the reality of the village and never dared to break in. Even now, the people in this area are very tightly organized, and special agents and bandits who try to sneak into the area are captured as soon as they enter the village. Because of his connection with the masses, he completed the grain requisition work in his area within a month.

　　出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的少数民族战斗英雄
    【新华社二十六日讯】出席这次全国战斗英雄代表会议的代表中，有很多少数民族的英雄模范。他们在反抗国民党的民族压迫和争取祖国独立的斗争中表现了卓越的革命英雄主义。
    二十三岁的蒙族青年、某骑兵部队团的副参谋长邰嘉德，在一九四五年入伍六个月后的首次作战中就荣膺为战斗英雄的称号。他经历过大小战斗二百多次。在解放齐齐哈尔的战斗中，他以骑兵教员的身份，请求参加突击组战斗，他和他的两名战友用四颗手榴弹逼使一百二十多个敌人缴械投降。而在一九四七年十二月四平街北大洼的战斗中，这位人民骑兵部队的英雄又挥舞着战刀带领铁骑冲入敌阵，一人砍倒四十多个敌人，缴获轻重机枪五挺、六零炮两门。另一位蒙族战斗英雄好特老，虽然只参加了六、七次战斗，他却已立了三次大功，俘掳和杀死敌人三十多名，缴获枪支二十四支。他兼有劳动模范的光荣称号。在劳动中，他以自己的劳动模范行动，使他所领导的班每天打柴一千三、四百捆。现在他已调升为某骑兵部队的副排长。
    人民解放军第五军（原新疆的民族军）的战斗英雄拉多诺夫出生在新疆伊犁一个维吾尔同胞贫苦的农家。当一九四四年十一月间，新疆人民的游击队攻入伊犁城时，他奋不顾身地帮助了游击队，并在战斗结束后参加了这支新疆人民武装。这个维族青年用他自己缴自敌人的步枪，建立了多次功勋。在精河县战役中，他自动要求担任爆炸任务。他带领着五个战友，冒着敌人五挺机枪的射击，接近了敌人的碉堡，终于将敌人的三座碉堡炸毁，他自己也负了伤。
    去年十一月才参加第五军的另一个维族青年库尔巴诺夫和他领导的“库尔巴诺夫突击队”则是一面光辉的劳动旗帜。他在兴修伊犁皇渠时，以八小时的劳动开冻土二十六点七立方公尺。水利修建委员会的英雄榜上他立了头功，被誉为第五军出色的劳动模范。
    曾在祖国最南端琼崖坚持艰苦的敌后斗争的黎族战斗英雄陈理文，就是琼崖万千英勇人民中的优秀儿女。他在一九四四年参加了人民解放军琼崖纵队，并在一九四八年展开秋季攻势以来，参加了八次攻坚战斗，每次都勇敢地完成了任务。他曾三次光荣负伤，但他和他的许多战友们流的血，终于换取了海南岛人民的自由和解放。
    出席这次全国战斗英雄代表会议的民兵英雄武天才是阿西族人，原是国民党统治下一个乡丁队的队丁。他领导了二十多个乡丁，在一九四七年冬天的一个夜晚，在云南弥勒县竹园镇举行了反抗国民党反动统治的武装起义。在那次武装起义后，他接着就号召了八十多个阿西青年参加了他们的队伍。这一支一百多人的队伍曾经和上万的伪保安队作过战，曾经在大森林中痛击围攻他们的国民党匪军一个团。不久，他们参加了朱家璧将军领导的云南人民武装。在一九四八年攻击广南县城时，武天才从塞满污泥臭水的水道中钻进城去，接应攻城部队打进了城，他在一夜中一人捉了五十多个俘虏。
    还有一位云南民兵英雄林子清，他是云南峨山县北郊阿保租的一位窝尼族青年。阿保租一带都是窝尼同胞，现在这一地区是峨山县群众工作做得最有成绩的，这就是林子清两年多努力的结果。一九四九年初，当蒋匪二十六军开到他们地区时，林子清就动员群众坚壁清野，组织起民兵，把村子完全封锁起来。敌人弄不清村内虚实，始终不敢闯进来。一直到现在，这一地区的人民组织得很严密，企图潜入该地区的特务土匪一进村子就被捉将起来。由于他联系群众，所以他这一区的征粮工作在一个月内就完成了任务。
