Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 23rd dispatch: The Administrative Committee of the Transport Workers' International, one of the industrial departments of the World Federation of Trade Unions, held a meeting in Warsaw from the 19th to the 21st. Representatives from the transport workers' unions of the Soviet Union, China, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, France, and Italy attended.

At the meeting, Mahini delivered a report on the tasks of the Transport Workers' International in the struggle for peace. He pointed out that the current stage of the struggle for peace requires expanding the mass base of the peace movement to the greatest extent. The working class is not limited to collecting signatures for peace declarations and promoting peace programs but must push this movement to the industrial level. For example, workers in capitalist countries must refuse to produce and transport munitions and military supplies. All transport unions must use all means to promote and implement new methods of peaceful struggle proposed by the masses.

The meeting passed a resolution on future activities and a letter to transport workers worldwide, calling on transport workers in all countries to expand the organization of peace committees and calling on transport workers in capitalist countries to launch a movement to paralyze the transport of military supplies by warmongers.

The meeting decided to accept the transport workers' unions of Cuba, Finland, and Australia as members.

The meeting passed a telegram of greetings to Stalin, the teacher and leader of the working class worldwide. The meeting sent a telegram of greetings to the heroic Korean transport workers and a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, protesting the armed aggression against Korea by American imperialism and firmly demanding the immediate withdrawal of American troops from Korea.
