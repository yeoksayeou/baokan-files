　　Beijing Electric Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant
    Completes Annual Task in Eight Months
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Electric Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant has completed its annual production task four months ahead of schedule. When the factory's employees held the first company-wide employee representative meeting at the end of June, they wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting their production achievements, proposing the slogan: "Strive to complete the annual production task by the end of September." Starting on July 1st, they launched a production competition. The workers displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm, adjusted labor organization, improved tools, and improved operating methods, greatly increasing production efficiency. In the competition, the factory's employees changed the slogan from "Strive to complete" to "Guarantee to complete," and finally changed "Guarantee to complete" to "Complete ahead of schedule." As a result, the forging team took the lead and completed the annual plan by the end of July, followed by the electrical panel team on August 16th. By August 31st, the entire task of building eighteen new cars and overhauling twelve locomotives and trailers each for the year was completed. The carpentry team also used the saved materials to build an "Economy Car" in early this month.

　　京市电车公司修造厂
    八个月完成全年任务
    【京市新闻处讯】京市电车公司修造厂的全年生产任务，已经提前四个月完成。该厂职工在六月底举行第一次全公司职工代表会议时，曾向毛主席写信报告生产成绩，提出：“争取九月底完成全年生产任务”的口号，“七一”起他们就展开了生产竞赛，工人们发挥高度劳动热情，调整劳动组织、改进工具、改进操作方法，生产效率大大提高。全厂职工在竞赛中又把口号由“争取完成”变到“保证完成”最后把“保证完成”又改为“提前完成”。结果，锻工班一马当先，七月底就完成了全年计划，电案班接着八月十六日完成。到八月三十一日，全年造新车十八辆、大修机车拖车各十二辆任务便全部完成了。木工班还用节省下来的材料于本月上旬造出一辆“节约车”。
