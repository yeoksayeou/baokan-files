    Twenty, Leadership's Self-Criticism
    As soon as Li Yong left, Representative Zhang immediately convened a cadre meeting specifically to discuss the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" issue.
    After everyone had silently considered for a while, the section chief was the first to speak. He said:
    "The 'Mao Zedong Locomotive' takes the lead in implementing the responsibility system, and its running performance is the greatest. However, the workers are not united. If this problem is not resolved quickly, or not resolved well, the achievements will not be consolidated."
    The union director, Lao Chen, was the earliest driver of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive." When he was transferred for training, Li Yong took over his work, so he understood Shang Baoheng, Zheng Dugong, etc. very well. He said:
    "Shang Baoheng has individual heroism, Zheng Dugong likes to be lazy, and Old Hero does a good job with a strong sense of responsibility, but he takes his personal interests too seriously. After his rice was confiscated, his speech and attitude changed. He looked at everyone unfavorably, so he couldn't unite people. This is one aspect. On the other hand: After Representative Song left, we only praised and encouraged them, without carrying out good ideological education. I think the leadership should take responsibility!"
    The branch secretary continued:
    "Lao Chen's opinion is very correct. The main responsibility should lie with the branch. There are no party members in the Mao Zedong Locomotive, and the branch has not given them good help and education to quickly raise their class consciousness."
    The section chief said again:
    "I think if we want to do a good job, without having Old Hero get off the train, we should transfer Shang Baoheng and Zheng Dugong away. They can never get along well together!"
    The branch secretary disagreed:
    "Transferring any of them away is not a fundamental solution to the problem. My opinion is that the Party should strengthen their education and leadership, correct their ideological problems, overcome their shortcomings, and unite them."
    "I completely agree with that!" Union leader Lao Chen raised his hand.
    "Then what are the specific measures?" the section chief asked.
    "Keep the old ones, replace the new ones, and transfer Party members to the train!" the branch secretary replied.
    Representative Zhang also said finally:
    "The Liberation War has shifted from counter-offensive to offensive, and the transportation tasks are becoming more and more urgent day by day. The 'Mao Zedong Locomotive' should take the lead and absolutely cannot collapse. I agree with the branch secretary's opinion to transfer Party members to the train."
    The final decision was: replace the new workers sent a few days ago and transfer special-class hero Guo Shude to the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" with two Party members.

    二十、领导上检讨
    李永一走，张代表立刻召开干部会，专门讨论“毛泽东号”的问题。
    大家沉默考虑了一会，段长头一个发言，他说：
    “毛泽东号带头推行负责制，跑车成绩最大。可是工友们不团结。如果这问题不赶快解决，或解决得不好，成绩就会巩固不住。”
    工会主任老陈原是“毛泽东号”最早的司机长，他调去受训时，李永接了他的工作，因此他对商宝恒、郑笃恭等很了解，他发言道：
    “商宝恒有个人英雄主义，郑笃恭爱偷懒，老英雄工作好，责任心强，但是把个人利益看得过重，没收他大米以后，说话、态度都变了，看谁也不顺眼，因此就团结不住人。这是一方面。另一方面：宋代表走了以后，咱们对他们只有表扬鼓励，没有很好的进行思想教育，我看领导上要负责任！”
    支部书记接着说：
    “老陈的意见很对，主要应该由支部负责。毛泽东号没有党员，支部也没有给他们很好的帮助和教育，把他们的阶级觉悟很快提高。”
    段长又说：
    “我看要想搞好，不叫老英雄下车，就把商宝恒、郑笃恭调走，他们几个在一块怎么也闹不好！”
    支部书记不同意：
    “把他们哪一个调走，也不是根本解决问题的办法，我的意见是：党要加强对他们的教育和领导，纠正他们的思想毛病，克服各人的缺点，使他们团结起来。”
    “这我完全同意！”工会老陈举了手。
    “那末具体办法呢？”段长问。
    “老的一个不动，把新的换下来，调党员上车！”支部书记回答。
    张代表最后也说：
    “解放战争由反攻转向进攻，运输任务一天比一天紧，‘毛泽东号’应该带头前进，绝对不能垮下去，我同意支部书记的意见，调党员上车。”
    最后决定：把前些日子派去的几个新工友换下来，另调特等英雄郭树德带两个党员到“毛泽东号”去。
