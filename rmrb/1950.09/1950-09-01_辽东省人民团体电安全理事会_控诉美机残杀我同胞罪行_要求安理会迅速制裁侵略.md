Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st: People's organizations in Liaoning Province, including the Preparatory Committee of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Provincial Democratic Women's Federation, and the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles, jointly sent a telegram to the Security Council on the 28th, lodging an accusation and demanding that the Security Council immediately take measures to stop the atrocities of the American invading troops in Korea. The telegram begins by stating: On August 27th, aircraft of the American invading troops in Korea illegally intruded into the airspace of Ji'an and Linjiang in our Liaoning Province, and the vicinity of the Dalizi Railway Station, as well as the airspace above Andong City, and continuously strafed Andong, Linjiang, and Dalizi Railway Station. As a result of the American aircraft's strafing, twenty-four of our compatriots were killed or injured, and two trucks, one passenger car, three locomotives, and one guard van were damaged. The telegram stated: The people of our Liaoning Province personally witnessed American military aircraft intruding into our national airspace, and we personally heard the sounds of machine guns fired by American military aircraft at our compatriots. In particular, when we personally saw the injured workers lying in the hospital, some had their lungs pierced by American bullets, and others had their arms broken by American bullets. Comrade Sun Yugui unfortunately sacrificed his life after being rushed to the hospital due to excessive blood loss because his spleen had been pierced by American bullets. Our anger is difficult to contain. We represent the 8.5 million people of Liaoning Province and fully support the serious protest lodged by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, to the United States government, and we request the Security Council to accept our accusations and suggestions, to swiftly sanction the American aggressors' illegal intrusion into our national airspace, the killing of our people, and the destruction of our property, and to immediately take measures to order the American government to completely withdraw its invading troops in Korea.
