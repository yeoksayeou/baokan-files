Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd:

　　The following is a summary of the opening speech made by Ma Xulun, Minister of Education of the Central People's Government, at the National Conference on Worker-Peasant Education on September 20th:

　　At present, worker-peasant education in our country has two basic components: one is the spare-time education of workers and peasants, mainly literacy education; the other is the cultural education of worker-peasant cadres.

　　In the past year, the spare-time education of workers and peasants nationwide has made preliminary progress. Nearly 700,000 workers have participated in spare-time schools. Last winter, in areas where land reform had been carried out, more than 10 million peasants participated in winter literacy classes. The primary task of this education at present is to carry out literacy campaigns and gradually reduce illiteracy. Literacy education is the starting point of worker-peasant education. Only by cultivating the ability of workers and peasants to read, write, and calculate can we further improve their culture and gradually train them to become cultured and educated people.

　　Literacy education should be combined with education on political current events and production technology. In the past, some comrades in some places underestimated the value of culture and did not recognize the political significance of literacy education, which was wrong. Similarly, conducting cultural education in isolation or having a purely cultural perspective is also incorrect.

　　Literacy education should be carried out in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner according to the actual conditions of each region (such as the different levels of awareness and learning requirements of the masses in newly liberated areas and old liberated areas; the different busy and slack seasons for farmers south of the Yangtze River and in North and Northeast China). At present, we should first focus on eliminating illiteracy among worker-peasant cadres, and then select worker districts with suitable conditions, as well as rural areas with suitable conditions after land reform, to carry out literacy campaigns among organized workers and peasants. At the same time, we should create conditions and accumulate experience nationwide to prepare for a comprehensive elimination of illiteracy. This is the policy that national worker-peasant spare-time education should adopt today.

　　Worker-peasant cadres who are already literate, as well as a portion of young activists among workers and peasants who have a preliminary cultural level and can pursue advanced studies, require another type of education, that is, cultural improvement. Although this group of people is only a minority among all workers and peasants, improving their cultural level is, in terms of its significance, even more important than the spare-time education of the general masses. Many of them have had no opportunity to attend school in the past, and coupled with years of heavy revolutionary tasks, they have had no time to study, so their culture is still very low today. Therefore, today, it is still temporarily difficult for them to undertake more complex work tasks. The state should and must give them the opportunity to study culture. One form of cultural education for worker-peasant cadres is to run worker-peasant cultural supplementary schools for them, and according to the different situations and ages of the students, to raise them to a cultural level equivalent to that of junior high school graduates within a certain period of time. They are transferred from various organs, leave their work, concentrate on studying, and after graduation, can still return to their local organs. This is very important for the revolution and for national construction. Such schools should generally be run by local organs and groups. However, the state should have a unified policy and certain educational standards, teaching plans, curricula and teaching materials, as well as examination and graduation systems for such schools. In fact, some places already have such schools. We hope that this conference can summarize the existing experiences and stipulate a method so that it can be universally and correctly carried out in various places.

　　Another main form of cultural education for worker-peasant cadres is the worker-peasant rapid middle school. This is specifically for training worker-peasant cadres and outstanding worker-peasant youth, preparing them for further studies in institutions of higher learning in the future, and training them into senior construction talents. The requirements for the students admitted to this type of school should be relatively strict. They must have a cultural level equivalent to that of a higher primary school graduate, have the ambition to make progress, have the determination to study for a long time, and be qualified to complete the courses of institutions of higher learning. The main difference between this type of school and cultural supplementary schools is in further education. This is an important step for the state to cultivate new-type intellectuals and experts from worker-peasant backgrounds in a planned manner. Without running this type of school, and without running this type of school well, people from worker-peasant backgrounds will not be able to enter the gates of institutions of higher learning in a short period of time. Eighteen such schools have now been started on a trial basis across the country. Because there was no experience in the past, and the policy was not clear enough, in fact, there may be principled differences from what I am saying now. It is hoped that everyone will repeatedly discuss this at this conference, and strive to clarify the policy, exchange the experiences of the past year, and find ways to solve its educational standards, teaching plans, curriculum, teaching materials, teachers and other important issues.

### 中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长  在全国工农教育会上开幕词的摘要

    在全国工农教育会上开幕词的摘要
    【新华社二十二日讯】中央人民政府教育部马叙伦部长九月二十日在全国工农教育会议上所作的开幕词，摘要如下：
    我国工农教育在目前有两项基本内容：一项是工人、农民的业余教育，主要是识字教育；另一项是工农干部的文化教育。
    一年来，全国工农群众的业余教育有了初步的发展。工人参加业余学校学习的已近七十万人。去年冬季，在经过土地改革的地区，农民参加冬学学习的已有一千余万人。这种教育在目前的首要任务是开展识字运动，逐步减少文盲。识字教育是工农教育的起点，要培养了工人、农民读、写、算的能力，才能进一步提高他们的文化，使他们逐渐学成有文化、有教养的人。
    识字教育应当与政治时事和生产技术的教育相结合。过去有些地方，有些同志，轻视文化的价值，没有认识识字教育的政治意义，是不对的。同样，孤立地进行文化教育或单纯的文化观点，也是不对的。
    识字教育要按照各地区的实际情况（如解放不久的地区与老解放区群众觉悟程度与学习要求不同；长江以南与华北、东北农民的忙闲季节不同），有计划有步骤有重点地进行。目前首先应着重扫除工农干部中的文盲，其次是选择有条件的工人区，以及土地改革后有条件的农村，在有组织的工人农民中开展识字运动，同时在全国范围内创造条件，积累经验，作全面扫除文盲的准备。这就是全国工农业余教育在今天要采取的方针。
    已经识字的工农干部，以及工农群众中有一部分具备初步文化水平可以深造的青年积极分子，需要另一种教育，即在文化上提高。这一部分人在全部工农群众中虽只是少数，但是提高这一部分人的文化水平，按其意义说，却比一般群众的业余教育还要重要。他们之中的很多人，由于过去没有机会上学，加以连年繁重的革命任务，无暇学习，所以现在文化还很低。因此在今天，他们还暂时难于担负较复杂的工作任务。国家对于他们应该而且必须给以学习文化的机会。工农干部文化教育的一种形式，就是为他们办一种工农文化补习学校，按学生各人不同情况、年龄，希望在一定时期，提高到等于初中毕业的文化程度。他们从各机关抽调出来，脱离工作，专心学习，毕业以后，仍可以回到本地的本机关去。这对于革命，对于国家建设，都是十分重要的。这类学校，一般应由各地方各机关、各团体来办。但国家对这种学校应有一个统一的方针和一定的教育标准、教学计划、课程和教材，以及考试和毕业的制度。这类学校，事实上有的地方已经有了。我们希望这次大会能把已有的经验总结起来，规定一个办法，以便在各地普遍地正确地办起来。
    工农干部文化教育还有一种主要的形式是工农速成中学。这是专为培养工农干部以及优秀的工农青年，准备将来升入高等学校进一步深造，培养成高级建设人才为目的的。这一种学校所收的学员，对他们的要求要比较严格，一定要有高小毕业的文化程度，要有上进的志趣、有长期学习的决心、能修完高等学校的课程的人方合格。这种学校与文化补习学校的差别，主要是在升学。这是国家有计划地培养工农出身的新型知识分子、专门家的一个重要步骤。不办这类学校，不办好这类学校，工农出身的人就无法在短时期走进高等学校的门。这类学校现在全国已开始试办了十八所。因为过去没有经验，方针上也还不够明确，因此，在事实上，也许和我现在说的有原则的出入。这就希望大家在这次会议中，反复地讨论，务必使方针明确，并交换一年来的经验，设法解决它的教育标准、教学计划、课程、教材、师资等等重要问题。
