　　"Wipe Out the American Imperialists Who Dare to Provoke War on Our Defense Line!"
     A Record of the North China Military Region Combat Heroes Symposium
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    "To master modern combat techniques more skillfully, to intensify the regularization training of the troops, to become a strong national defense force, and to wipe out the American imperialists who dare to provoke war on our defense line." This was the unanimous call of more than fifty combat heroes from the North China Military Region at the symposium.

    The heroes who participated in this symposium were all outstanding commanders, both wise and courageous, and proficient in both military and civilian affairs, who had grown up under the cultivation of the Communist Party and had been tempered by long years of war. From the speeches of the heroes, it can be seen how the People's Liberation Army defeated the Japanese invaders and the American imperialist running dog, Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army, in the past War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War. At the same time, the powerful lineup of the People's Liberation Army today can also be seen. Tank hero Dong Laifu, 23 years old, had only two years of schooling in the past, but after three years of hard training and combat, he has become an excellent and technically skilled tank driver. In the Liaoxi-Jinzhou Campaign, he drove a dilapidated old tank captured from the enemy, braving Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army's intensive artillery fire, and attacked the enemy five times in a row, overcoming difficulties each time and successfully completing his mission. He was awarded a major merit in this campaign, and the tank he drove was gloriously named "Meritorious Service Vehicle." Immediately afterwards, he participated in the Tianjin Campaign. Although the tank was only repaired two hours before the attack, he still completed the combat mission. He was awarded another major merit in this campaign. There are now many excellent tank soldiers like him in the People's Liberation Army tank force. Artillery hero Li Qiyuan was initially transferred from the infantry to work in the artillery unit. He was not familiar with the names of some artillery pieces, but after four weeks of training, he participated in actual combat and confidently coordinated with the infantry in every battle. The artillery company he led achieved an average hit rate of 93%. Now he can not only operate field guns freely, but also use various other types of artillery. Combat hero Pu Qingtang led a platoon to wipe out a battalion of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army in the Battle of解放石家庄 Shijiazhuang. In the Battle of Taiyuan, combat hero Lu Genbao led a squad to capture three solid bunkers of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan's bandit army in one night, wiping out a company of the enemy. Because of his flexible and calm command, only one person in the entire squad was slightly injured.

    Why were they able to achieve such glorious victories? What strength supported them to be so brave and tenacious? The heroes all said this: In the past, they had to beg for food and work as hired laborers (some were miners). Only after the Communist Party and Chairman Mao came did they have land, and their families could live happily. However, their ideals did not stop there. They had even greater causes and victories waiting for them to work hard for. The Mongolian youth combat hero Tai Xide said in broken Chinese, "I have seen Beijing, the capital of the people, and I have also seen the future of the new China. Our task is to defend our motherland, to defend the benefactor of the people, Mao Zedong, so that our motherland can quickly carry out construction and the people can live the happiest life." These are the sources of the heroes' strength, and the sources of the strength of the entire People's Liberation Army.

    The heroes expressed infinite hatred for the aggressive behavior of American imperialism and its running dogs. Combat hero Zhao Guolin said excitedly, "After hearing the news of the American imperialist planes bombing Andong in Northeast China, I became even more aware of the face of American imperialism. I will not put down my gun until the imperialist elements in the world are completely eliminated." The old hero Lü Junsheng, who stabbed twenty-seven enemies to death with a bayonet in the Xiajin battle during the War of Resistance Against Japan, said, "I know the skills of those young master soldiers of American imperialism. They won't lie down without a wool blanket, and they won't fight without cigarettes and bread. If American imperialism dares to invade our territory, I will use the combat experience of the past War of Resistance Against Japan to wipe them out." The Mongolian youth hero Tai Xide, who used a machete to kill forty-seven Chiang Kai-shek soldiers in one battle during the People's Liberation War, said, "I am a Mongolian. The cultivation and education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao have made me a hero. This is the glory of our Mongolian people. This time I will definitely study the experiences of all the heroes carefully. If the paper tiger American imperialism dares to provoke war, I will use my machete to chop the invading enemies to death on our defense line." The heroes present unanimously stated, "We are determined to liberate Taiwan, liberate Tibet, and protect the integrity of our motherland's territory. As long as imperialist elements exist, we will fight for one day!"

　　“将敢于挑动战争的美帝国主义者消灭在我们的国防线上！” 
     记华北军区战斗英雄座谈会
    本报记者  朱波
    “更熟练的掌握现代化的作战技术，加紧部队正规化的训练，成为坚强的国防军，将敢于挑动战争的美帝国主义者，消灭在我们的国防线上”。这是华北军区五十多位战斗英雄在座谈会上的一致呼声。
    参加这次座谈会的英雄们，都是在共产党培育下经过长期战争的锻炼而成长起来的智勇双全、文武兼备的优秀指挥员。从英雄们的发言中，可以看出人民解放军在过去抗日战争及人民解放战争中，是怎样击败日寇及美帝走狗蒋匪军的。同时，也可以看出今天人民解放军的强大的阵容。二十三岁的战车英雄董来扶，过去只读过二年书，但是经过三年的苦练与战斗，已使他成为优秀的技术熟练的坦克驾驶员，他在辽西锦州战役中，驾驶着一辆从敌人手中缴来的最破的旧式坦克，冒着蒋匪密集的炮火，连续向敌人攻击了五次，每次都排除困难胜利的完成了任务。在这次战役中，他立了一大功，他驾驶的坦克车，也光荣的被命名为“功臣号”。紧接着又参加了天津战役，虽然在进攻前两小时才把坦克修好，但仍然完成了作战任务。在这次战役中，他又立了一大功。像他这样优秀的坦克兵，在人民解放军战车部队里，现在已经有很多。炮兵英雄李启元，开始从步兵调到炮兵部队工作时，有些炮的名称还不熟悉，经过四个星期的训练后即参加了实际作战，并在每次战斗中，都十分有把握的配合了步兵作战。在他所带领的一个炮兵连队，射击纪录平均达百分之九十三的命中率。现在他不仅对野炮操纵自如，对其它各种炮也能运用了。战斗英雄蒲庆棠，在解放石家庄战役中，他曾带领一个排的兵力，歼灭蒋匪军的一个营。战斗英雄卢根保在解放太原战役中率领一个班，一夜连克蒋阎匪军的三个坚固碉堡，歼灭敌人一个连，因为他的指挥灵活、沉着，全班只轻伤一人。
    为什么他们能取得这样光辉的胜利，什么力量支持着他们如此勇敢顽强呢？英雄们都是这样说：过去要过饭、当过雇工（有的是矿工），共产党毛主席来了以后才有了土地，亲人们才能愉快的过着幸福的时光。但是，他们的理想并没有因此而停止，他们有更远大的事业和胜利等待着他们去努力。蒙族青年战斗英雄邰喜德用不熟练的汉话说：“我看见了人民的首都北京，也看见了新中国的将来，我们的任务，就是要保卫我们的祖国，保卫人民的恩人毛泽东，使我们的祖国能迅速的进行建设，使人民过着最幸福的生活。”这些，就是英雄们的力量的源泉，就是全体人民解放军力量的源泉。
    英雄们对美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略行为，表示无限的愤恨。战斗英雄赵国林很激动地说：“我听到美帝国主义的飞机轰炸东北安东的消息后，使我更认清了美帝国主义的面目，世界上的帝国主义分子不完全消灭，我是不会放下枪杆的。”过去在抗日战争中的夏津战斗时，一连用刺刀刺死二十七个敌人的老英雄吕俊生说：“美帝国主义那些少爷兵的本领我是知道的，他们没有洋毯就不卧倒，没有香烟、面包就不打仗。美帝国主义真敢侵犯我们的国土，我将以过去抗日战争中的战斗经验，来消灭他们。”在人民解放战争中，在一次战斗中曾用马刀劈死四十七个蒋匪军的蒙族青年英雄邰喜德说：“我是蒙古人，经过共产党和毛主席的培养教育使我成了英雄，这是我们蒙古人民的光荣。这一次我一定好好的学习各位英雄的经验，纸老虎美帝国主义真敢挑动战争，我将用我的马刀将进犯的敌人劈死在我们的国防线上。”到会的英雄们都一致表示：“坚决解放台湾，解放西藏，保护我们祖国领土的完整。帝国主义分子存在一天，我们将战斗一天！”
