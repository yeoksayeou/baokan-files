Xinhua News Agency, 27th:
The head office of the People's Bank of China has instructed the Bank of China to change the foreign exchange rate system from a single price (with a 0.5% handling fee) to a bid-ask spread system, effective September 28th. Under the changed system, foreign exchange rates will be set with a 0.1% spread between the buying and selling prices. The buying price for US dollars is 31,000 yuan, and the selling price is 31,320 yuan; the buying price for Hong Kong dollars is 4,750 yuan, and the selling price is 4,790 yuan; the buying price for British pounds is 78,210 yuan, and the selling price is 78,990 yuan.

Regarding the reasons for this change in the pricing system, the responsible person of the People's Bank of China head office stated: In the past, the foreign exchange rate system has always implemented a single price system, with buying and selling conducted at the same rate. However, in order to take into account the necessary expenses of foreign exchange designated banks and the burden of import and export merchants, a certain handling fee was charged. Initially, it was generally set at 1%, but after prices stabilized in March and April of this year, the handling fee was reduced to 0.5%, which is much lower than the 2.5% to 2.6% spread during the Kuomintang reactionary government era, fully taking care of import and export trade. In terms of overseas remittances, not only has no handling fee been charged, but preferential overseas remittance rates have also been set when the exchange rate was relatively low. However, since the implementation of this method, some people are still not used to it and request the implementation of two prices for buying and selling and the cancellation of handling fees. This is partly because the commercial practices of all countries in the world (including socialist and capitalist countries) separate buying and selling prices; on the other hand, it can also avoid calculation troubles. The head office of the People's Bank of China is complying with this request and has decided to change to a bid-ask spread system starting from September 28th. As for overseas remittances, no handling fees will still be charged.

### 中国银行改变外汇牌价为买卖差价制度

　　中国银行改变外汇牌价为买卖差价制度
    中国人民银行总行顷指示中国银行，自九月二十八日起，将外汇牌价由过去买卖同一牌价（各收千分之五手续费）改变为买卖差价制度。改变制度后的外汇牌价均按千分之十的差价订出买入价和卖出价，其中美汇买入价为三一、○○○元，卖出价为三一、三二○元；港汇买入价为四、七五○元，卖出价为四、七九○元；英汇买入价七八、二一○元，卖出价为七八、九九○元。
    关于此次改变牌价制度的原因，据中国人民银行总行负责人称：过去外汇牌价始终实行一个牌价制度，买进卖出都依此进行。但为照顾外汇指定银行的必要开支和进出口商人的负担起见，酌收若干手续费。开始时，一般订为千分之十，今年三、四月物价稳定后，手续费又降为千分之五，比较国民党反动政府时代千分之二十五到二十六的差价低了许多，充分地照顾到了进出口贸易。而在侨汇上，不仅一直不收分文手续费，而且在牌价较低时，曾易订侨汇优待牌价。但此项办法实行以来，仍有一部分人不甚习惯，而要求实行买进卖出两个牌价，并取消手续费办法。这一方面因为世界各国（包括社会主义和资本主义国家）的商业习惯都分开买进卖出两个牌价；另一方面也可以免除计算手续上的麻烦。中国人民银行总行顺应此项要求，决定自九月二十八日起改为买卖差价制度，至于对侨汇，则仍然不收手续费用。
