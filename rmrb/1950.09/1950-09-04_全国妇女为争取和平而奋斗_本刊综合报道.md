　　National Women Strive for Peace

　　A Comprehensive Report by This Publication

　　Women across the country have demonstrated fervent enthusiasm during the height of the signature campaign to defend world peace. They have eagerly signed the peace declaration and actively participated in the publicity and collection work for the peace signature campaign. In peace signature campaigns across the country, women have played a significant role in promoting the movement.

　　According to statistics from four cities and eight counties in Songjiang Province, Northeast China, by the beginning of August, women accounted for over 247,000 of the 550,779 signatories in these cities and counties, representing slightly less than 45% of the total signatures. 60% of the women in these cities and counties have already signed. Among them, 6,500 women in Tangfang District, Bin County, have signed, accounting for slightly less than 96% of the total of 6,777 women in the district. In Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, 34,840 women had already signed by the end of June, exceeding one-third of the city's female population. In Xi'an City, the number of women who had signed reached over 36,000 by the end of July. They also wrote 755 letters of慰问 (wèi wèn -congratulations and solicitude) to the soldiers of the Korean People's Army who were fighting to defend world peace. According to statistics from Nanzheng City and nine counties in the Xianyang sub-region of Shaanxi Province, 160,000 rural working women have already signed. In the tenth township of Wangqu District, Chang'an County, the number of women signatories reached 208. In Yijun County, the number of women who had signed reached 1,775 by the end of June. Li Xuewa from Hejiashan, Sanxiang, Puhua District, Lantian County, not only signed her own name, but also wrote the names of her three children, saying, "One more person is one more strength. For the happiness of our children, we must resolutely defend world peace." In Lanzhou City, many housewives brought their children to the signing locations. By the end of June, according to incomplete statistics, 18,263 women had signed. In Linxia City, after publicizing the significance of the peace signature campaign, more than 300 people from the Hui and Han ethnic groups signed within one hour, of which more than 80 were Hui women. The Democratic Women's Federation of Bachu County, Xinjiang Province, carried out extensive publicity, and by the beginning of August, had mobilized 1,949 women from various ethnic groups to sign. In Tianjin City, the number of women signatories had reached over 151,000 by the beginning of August, including more than 90,000 housewives, 32,000 female workers, and nearly 30,000 other women. More than 147,000 rural women in the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Region have already signed. The majority of organized women in rural areas of Funing, Pixu and other counties in the region have signed. In Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, more than 50,000 housewives signed in five days at the end of June. Some women even made the peace declaration on silk and signed it solemnly. In Kaifeng City, Henan Province, more than 70,000 women have signed.

　　Women's organizations in various regions have mobilized women to sign and participate in publicity and collection work for the peace signature campaign. On July 27, the Preparatory Committee of the Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation, the Xi'an City Women's Federation, the Women's Association of the Northwest General Branch of the China Democratic League, and the Women Workers' Department of the Northwest General Labor Union jointly convened a demonstration meeting of women from all walks of life in Xi'an City against the American invasion of Taiwan and Korea. In addition to calling on everyone to sign at the meeting, they also printed 800 copies of the peace signature book, and the women present rushed to sign the books and take them back to mobilize their neighbors to sign. The Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation and the Xi'an City Women's Federation also dispatched dozens of cadres, forming three groups to conduct publicity on the streets. The women's organization of the fourth township of the fifth district of Huayin County, Shaanxi Province, organized four peace signature groups, using blackboards, slogans, speeches, and other methods for publicity. By mid-July, more than 570 women in the township had signed. In June, the Women's Federation of Dihua City, Xinjiang, cooperated with the China and Xinjiang Branch of the China Peace Committee to mobilize people of all ethnic groups to sign, and more than 3,000 people personally went to the Women's Federation to sign. The Ningxia Zhongyu County organized a women's propaganda team, which did not stop publicizing even in heavy rain. In the third township of the first district alone, more than 780 women had signed. The Wuhan City Women's Federation mobilized 2,000 women to conduct publicity through family visits, lectures, and other methods. They mobilized more than 3,000 people to sign. More than 3,500 women in Chengdu City participated in the publicity and collection work for the peace signature campaign. The Yangzhou City Women's Federation in northern Jiangsu first convened a women's representative meeting to conduct publicity, and then the representatives used their influence as the backbone to conduct publicity and collect signatures among the broad masses of women. Thanks to their efforts and promotion, women accounted for approximately 50% of the 78,508 signatories in the city. The Xuchang City Women's Federation in Henan also held three women's representative meetings to conduct publicity.

　　Many of the activists who emerged in the peace signature campaign across the country were women. Zhang Zhen, a member of the Shanghai Women's Federation, is the mother of six children. She overcame her busy household chores and single-handedly promoted the signatures of more than 4,000 people, setting the city's highest record for the number of people mobilized for peace signatures by an individual. Zeng Saizhu, a cadre of the Wuhan City Women's Federation, mobilized more than 3,000 people to sign on her own. Gao Yuquan and Zhang Yangshi, two housewives over the age of 50 in Beijing, wore pictures of peace doves and anti-American aggression slogans, and traveled everywhere to collect signatures. In ten days, they collected 8,234 signatures on the peace declaration. Wang Lianru, a Hui woman in Xi'an City, tried every means to conduct publicity. She was illiterate, so she cooperated with Shi Caiping, a literate woman. She did the publicity herself, and Shi Caiping helped others sign. Together, they mobilized more than 3,000 people to sign. Jia Shuqin, another housewife in Xi'an City, automatically organized nine propaganda groups, and they mobilized more than 9,000 people to sign. Zhang Yingzhen, another housewife in Xi'an City, posted the slogans and some anti-American aggression leaflets issued to her by the City Women's Federation on a door panel, and bought two pens and an inkstone to put outside the door, often publicizing the significance of the peace signature campaign to passers-by. An elderly lady in her seventies who lived nearby was moved after listening to her publicity and said, "If the imperialists really want to fight us, even though I am old, I will fight them with a kitchen knife." Zhang Yingzhen has collected 1,300 signatures. They have recently received the "Defend World Peace" medals and other prizes awarded by the China and Xi'an Branch of the China Peace Committee.

　　In response to the call by the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and Against American Aggression and Chairman Cai Chang of the All-China Women's Federation that women should account for one-third of the total number of signatures nationwide, women's organizations in various regions are continuing to actively deploy and mobilize women from all walks of life to sign enthusiastically. The Northeast Democratic Women's Federation has notified the women's federations of various provinces and cities to use the method of convening women's representative meetings to deepen the peace signature campaign into the small and medium-sized towns and the broad masses of rural women. The Shenyang City Women's Federation has decided to send cadres to the suburban districts and villages to convene women's representative meetings to mobilize 300,000 women in the suburbs to participate in the signature campaign. After the armed provocation by American imperialist planes strafing our people on August 27, it aroused great anger among the people of the whole country. National women who are striving for peace will continue to sign the peace declaration more enthusiastically to show their united and incomparably strong power, resolutely defeat the armed provocations of American imperialism, and stop all wars of aggression.
