The China Railway Union Northeast Regional Committee
    Writes Letter to Chairman Mao
    Firmly Supports Foreign Minister Zhou's Protest Statement

　　[This newspaper's dispatch] The China Railway Union Northeast Regional Committee, representing 210,000 railway workers in Northeast China, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, expressing firm opposition to the shameless atrocities of the American imperialists and firm support for Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the US government. The full text is as follows:
    Respected Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    The military aircraft of the American invading army in Korea violated our national airspace, strafing our buildings, stations, and vehicles, and injuring our workers and residents, including one railway worker. The sovereignty and property of the country have suffered enormous losses. We, the 210,000 employees of the Northeast Railway, are extremely indignant at this shameless and brutal provocative crime of the American aggressors. We firmly support the solemn protest lodged by Foreign Minister Zhou to the US government and the complaint and recommendations submitted to the Security Council. We are stepping up our work and are determined, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and you, to use all our strength to support the heroic and powerful People's Liberation Army, consolidate national defense, defend the border, and resolutely smash the aggressive actions of US imperialism.
                                      China Railway Union Northeast Regional Committee
                                                 August 29
