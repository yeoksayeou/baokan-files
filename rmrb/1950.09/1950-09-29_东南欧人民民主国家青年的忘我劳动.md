　　The Selfless Labor of Youth in People's Democratic Countries of Southeast Europe

　　The People's Democratic countries of Southeast Europe—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania—have, in the short few years since the war, carried out great construction work and achieved brilliant successes, and have steadily embarked on the road of building socialism. In these construction efforts, the youth of each country have played a great role, dedicating immense strength and actively participating in the construction of the new nations with selfless labor.

　　In Poland, as early as 1945, eight thousand young people responded to the call to participate in labor production in Łódź, the center of the textile industry, enabling the rapid recovery of Poland's textile industry, which had been paralyzed by the war. In 1948, Polish youth established a unified youth organization, the Polish Youth Union (now with over 1.1 million members). In the same year, the "Service for Poland" team was organized, absorbing 100,000 young people aged sixteen to twenty-one. They built the highways of Warsaw, the Boruky Great Railway, the dams from Chakrokin to Visla and Koni to Valter, and many other projects. They worked five hours a day, spending the rest of their time studying. The service team educated its members in the spirit of internationalism and patriotism through study classes, construction teams, technical training classes, and social service camps. Poland's six-year plan, which began this year, plans to increase the output of machinery manufacturing by more than two times compared to 1949, and the total industrial output by more than one and a half times. Polish youth are participating in all aspects of work with great enthusiasm, striving to complete this huge plan.

　　Czechoslovak youth construction teams participated in many aspects of work. In the Bratislava region, the youth construction team spent a year and a half building a railway 21 kilometers long, including many caves and bridges. In 1945, 260,000 young people participated in harvest teams. During the Two-Year Plan, members of the Czech Youth League built 231 houses for miners, rebuilt the village of Lidice, which had been razed by the German invaders, and built two transmission lines. During the Five-Year Plan, Czech youth participated more widely in production and construction, and currently more than 140,000 young people are participating in socialist competitions and shock brigade movements. In 1950, the Czech Youth League took on three major tasks: 25,000 youth construction team members were to participate in the construction of Ostrava, 14,000 youth were to participate in the construction of the Slovak Friendship Railway, and 22,000 youth were to build the youth dam in the Slovak region.

　　In Hungary, there were 900 youth production groups, 500 youth construction teams, and 40,000 individual competitors, who played a huge role in the struggle to complete the Three-Year Plan in two years. Last year, young workers carried out voluntary processing to welcome the World Youth Festival held in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, producing goods worth 20 million forints for the country. Among the 534 shock brigades formed in factories, 5,000 were young workers. Preparations are now underway to establish "Youth Enterprises," entrusting all work from production to management to the youth.

　　Romania organized youth construction teams after liberation. They laid 51 kilometers of gas pipelines and 37 kilometers of coal gas pipelines. More than 28,600 young people built the 61-kilometer-long Salva-Vișeu railway. Three thousand three hundred and fifty-nine youth construction teams built two embankments with a length of 54 kilometers. In the industrial and oil field areas, youth built steel furnaces and youth oil wells. In 1948, 200,000 young people in Romania participated in construction work, building a carriage repair factory, the largest in Southeast Europe, in Craiova, 37 kilometers and 53 kilometers of transmission lines, and huge drainage projects. Now there are 800 youth work teams participating in the construction of new ports and 60 kilometers of canal projects.

　　The number of Bulgarian youth participating in construction teams increased from 6,000 in 1946 to 250,000 in 1949. They built the Hanboes mountain ridge highway running through the north and south of Bulgaria, completed the Mehuadera to Profdvov transmission equipment, built 54 kilometers of railway, and built the 800-meter-long Dimitrov Dam and the largest Rositz Dam in the country. Starting in the summer of 1948, they built the modern industrial center of Dimitrov City in sparsely populated towns, and also engaged in the construction of reservoirs, telephone networks, highways, tractor stations, joint factories, canals, and houses. Between 1947 and 1948, the youth construction team produced goods worth over 2.1583 billion leva for the country, saving the country 700 million leva. In 1949, there were 2,000 youth production groups in Bulgaria, and many labor heroes emerged. To express their respect for the leader of the Chinese people, 60 construction teams were named "Mao Zedong Construction Team."

　　Under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Youth League, the youth of Albania carried out selfless labor, enabling Albania to rapidly break away from its backward state and establish a modern industry. In 1946, 4,000 young people built a 65-kilometer-long highway in five months. In 1947 and 1948, 60,000 young people successively completed a 47-kilometer-long railway and a 36-kilometer-long youth railway, giving Albania its first railway. In 1949, tens of thousands of young people participated in the construction of a canal, building a highway in the Lulanica coal mining area and a railway in the Gaza industrial area. This year, Albanian youth will undertake three major construction projects: the Stalin Textile Factory in Tirana, the Malik sugar factory, and a new railway 33 kilometers long.

　　The youth of the People's Democratic countries of Southeast Europe not only heroically build new countries, but also vigilantly defend the fruits of their constructive labor. They actively participate in and promote the peace signature movement, and they resolutely oppose the imperialist conspiracy to prepare for aggressive wars. [Xinhua News Agency]

　　东南欧人民民主国家青年的忘我劳动
    东南欧的各人民民主国家——波兰，捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚等国，在战后短短的几年内，进行了伟大的建设工作，获得了辉煌的成就，业已稳步走上了建设社会主义基础的道路。在这些建设工作中，各国的青年起了伟大的作用，他们曾献出了巨大的力量，以忘我的劳动积极参加了新国家的建设。
    在波兰，一九四五年便有八千青年响应号召，到纺织工业中心的罗兹城参加劳动生产，使波兰因战争而陷于瘫痪的纺织工业迅速恢复。一九四八年波兰青年成立了统一的青年组织波兰青年联盟（现有盟员一百十余万人）。同年组织了“为波兰服务队”，吸收了由十六岁到二十一岁的十万青年参加。他们修筑了华沙的公路，波鲁基大铁路，查克罗金到维斯尔和康尼到瓦尔特的水坝和许多其他工程。他们每天工作五小时，其余时间进行学习。服务队通过学习班、建设队、技术训练班及社会服务营等方式，以国际主义和爱国主义的精神教育团员。波兰今年起开始实行的六年计划，准备使机器制造业的产量较一九四九年增加二倍以上，全部工业总产量增加一倍半以上。波兰青年正以巨大的热情参加各方面的工作，为完成这个庞大的计划而努力。
    捷克斯洛伐克的青年建设队参加了多方面的工作。在布拉底斯拉发州，青年建设队以一年半的时间修筑了一条长二十一公里，包括许多山洞和桥梁的铁路。一九四五年有二十六万青年参加了收获队。在二年计划中，捷克青年联盟员曾为矿工修建了二百三十一所房子，建设了被德寇夷平的里底斯村，修筑了两条输电线路。在五年计划时期，捷克青年更为广泛地参加了生产建设，目前已有十四万余青年参加社会主义竞赛与突击队的运动。一九五○年，捷克青年联盟担负起三大任务：二万五千青年建设队员要参加俄斯特拉发城的建设，一万四千青年要参加斯洛伐克的友好铁路的建设，二万二千青年将建筑斯洛伐克区的青年堤。
    在匈牙利，有九百个青年生产组，五百个青年建设队与四万个个人竞赛者，他们曾在争取两年完成三年计划的斗争中，发挥了巨大的作用。青年工人去年为迎接在匈京布达佩斯举行的世界青年联欢节进行义务加工，为国家多生产了价值两千万福林的物品。在工厂中组成的五百三十四个突击队中，有五千人是青工。现在正准备成立“青年企业”，把从生产到管理等全部工作，都交给青年来担任。
    罗马尼亚在解放后就组织了青年建设队。他们曾敷设了长五十一公里的冶气管，三十七公里的煤气管。二万八千六百余青年修筑了长六十一公里的萨尔伐——维沙铁道。三千三百五十九个青年建设队建筑了长五十四公里的两个堤岸。在工业区和油田区，青年建设了炼钢炉和青年油井。一九四八年罗马尼亚有二十万青年参加建设工作，曾在克拉奥夫城修筑了一所东南欧最大的车厢修理厂，长三十七公里与五十三公里的输电线路和巨大排水工程等。现在有八百个青年工作队，参加建筑新港口和六十公里的运河工程。
    保加利亚青年参加建设队的人数，在一九四六年有六千人，到一九四九年发展到二十五万人。他们筑成了贯穿保加利亚南北的汉波斯山岭公路，完成了梅花德拉到普罗夫的夫的输电设备，修筑了五十四公里的铁路，建筑了长八百公尺的季米特洛夫水坝和全国最大的罗西茨水坝。他们从一九四八年夏季开始在人烟稀少的小镇上，建筑现代化的工业中心季米特洛夫城，另外还从事建设蓄水池，电话网，公路，拖拉机站，联合工厂及运河，房屋等。在一九四七到一九四八年间，青年建设队为国家生产了价值二十一亿五千八百三十余万保币的物品，为国家节省了七亿保币。一九四九年保加利亚全国有两千个青年生产组，涌现了很多劳动英雄。为了表示他们对中国人民领袖的崇敬，有六十个建设队都以“毛泽东建设队”为名。
    在阿尔巴尼亚共产主义青年联盟的领导下，阿尔巴尼亚的青年进行了忘我的劳动，使阿尔巴尼亚迅速地脱离了落后的状况，建立起了现代的工业来。一九四六年，四千青年在五个月内修筑了六十五公里长的公路，一九四七和一九四八年，六万青年相继完成了长四十七公里的铁路和长三十六公里的青年铁路，使阿尔巴尼亚第一次有了铁路。一九四九年，数万青年参加了修筑运河的工程，修筑了率拉尼察煤矿区公路和加萨工业区的铁路。今年，阿尔巴尼亚青年要担负三大建设工程，即：地拉那的斯大林纺织工厂，马利克的制糖厂和长三十三公里的一条新铁路。
    东南欧各人民民主国家的青年不仅英勇地建设着新国家，并且警醒地保卫着他们的建设性劳动的成果。他们积极参加和推动和平签名运动，他们坚决反对帝国主义准备侵略战争的阴谋。【新华社】
