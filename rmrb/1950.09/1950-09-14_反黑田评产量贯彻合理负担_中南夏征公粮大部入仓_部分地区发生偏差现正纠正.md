　　Oppose Black Field Assessment of Production and Implement Reasonable Burden:
    Most of the Summer Grain from Central and Southern China is in Storage;
    Deviations Occur in Some Areas and are Being Corrected
    [Our newspaper Hankou News] The summer grain collection in Henan, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guangzhou provinces and cities in the Central and Southern District has generally been put into storage. Henan and Hubei provinces have mostly completed it, while Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guangzhou provinces and cities have now entered the storage stage. As of now, more than two-thirds of the total summer grain collection task in the entire region has been completed. As of mid-August, Henan had stored 90.54 percent of its total task, and six special districts, fifty-nine counties, and three cities had all completed their tasks. Hubei had mostly completed its task by August 15th, and the work is nearing completion. Guangdong has also entered the grain delivery stage, and many areas have completed their tasks. It is expected that the province will complete all grain deliveries by mid-September. Guangxi's summer grain collection covers four special districts, including Yulin, Wuzhou, Pingle, and Nanning. From mid-July to mid-August, the burden was completely distributed to households, and storage began at the end of August. It is expected to be completed by the end of September. Guangzhou is now entering the storage stage.
    In the summer grain collection work in various places, people's representative conferences, farmer representative meetings, cadre meetings, and village meetings were generally convened to discuss and publicize the summer grain burden methods, deeply mobilize the masses to oppose black fields, assess production, and implement reasonable burdens. The grain collection committees actively supervised the summer grain collection work, checked in a timely manner, corrected deviations, straightened out policies, and trained grain collection cadres. Therefore, the smooth progress of the summer grain collection work was ensured. Henan, by grasping the central link of opposing black fields and assessing production, and implementing the policy of reasonable burden, greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of the masses. It also promptly exposed the rumors of special agents, especially in conjunction with the production and disaster relief movement, which encouraged the masses to deliver grain. Guangdong and Guangxi provinces also had a longer preparation time, organized pilot committees, created models, and guided the overall situation. Within a certain period of time, grain collection was taken as the central task, and the main leaders of the Party and government were personally responsible for it. The Beijiang District Committee and Commissioner of Guangdong Province went to the countryside to organize temporary work committees to lead the work; the county Party committee secretaries and county heads of Xijiang District went to the countryside separately to grasp the key points. In the work, due to the thorough publicity and mobilization work, the summer grain collection work proceeded relatively smoothly. However, in some individual areas, the publicity of policies, mobilization of the masses, and correction of deviations were not deep or timely enough. Some cadres had a simple task-oriented view, disliked trouble, sought convenience, or simply wanted to be quick, and thus produced deviations in carrying out summer grain collection with simple administrative orders. Some even implemented average apportionment, violating the production incentive policy of producing more grain and not having to bear more burden. Even fewer village and township cadres and farmer representatives had local selfish ideas, concealing their own fields or collectively concealing fields, resulting in disproportionately light or heavy public grain burdens, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses and made the summer grain collection take a detour.
    Most areas made thorough plans and full preparations for the storage work in advance; the warehouses also carefully checked the quality of the grain, so the public grain stored in various places was generally clean, and the order of grain delivery was also very good. However, some areas lacked publicity and mobilization and specific inspection before storage, resulting in chaotic order, wet grain, containing chaff, containing soil, and insect infestation. A small number of warehouses neglected preparatory work in advance, lacked specific plans and organization, and could not guarantee receipt upon arrival, coupled with the rigid style of cadres, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses, so that individual areas found masses beating cadres in the grain collection. For example, in the grain collection of the Second Branch Warehouse in Ye County, four grain warehouse cadres were injured. The above-mentioned deviations in the storage work are being or have been corrected.

　　反黑田评产量贯彻合理负担
    中南夏征公粮大部入仓
    部分地区发生偏差现正纠正
    【本报汉口讯】中南区河南、湖北、广东、广西、广州等省市夏征公粮，已普遍入仓，河南、湖北两省已大部完成，广东、广西、广州等省、市现已进入入仓阶段。截至目前为止，全区夏征公粮已完成总任务的三分之二以上。河南截至八月中旬，入仓公粮占总任务百分之九十点五四，六个专区及五十九个县三个市已全部完成任务。湖北截至八月十五日，已大部完成，工作行将结束。广东亦已进入交粮阶段，也有不少地区全部完成了任务，全省公粮预计九月中旬可全部交齐。广西夏征计郁林、梧州、平乐、南宁等四专区，于七月中旬至八月中旬全部把负担分配到户，八月底开始入仓，预计九月底可完成入仓任务。广州市现已进入入仓阶段。
    各地夏征工作中，普遍召开了各界人民代表会议、农民代表会、干部会和村民大会，讨论和宣传了夏征负担办法，并深入发动群众反黑田、评产量、贯彻合理负担。征粮委员会积极督导夏征工作，及时检查，纠正偏向，端正政策，并训练了征粮干部。因此，保证了夏征工作的顺利进行。河南由于抓紧了反黑田，评产量这一中心环节，贯彻了合理负担政策，也大大刺激了群众生产热情。并及时揭露特务谣言，特别是结合了生产救灾运动，鼓舞了群众交粮的情绪。广东、广西两省也由于准备时间较长，组织试点委员会，创造典型，指导全盘。并在一定时间以内将征粮作为中心任务，党政首长亲自负责掌握。广东北江区地委、专员下乡分区组织临时工作委员会来领导工作；西江区县委、县长分别下乡，掌握重点。工作中，由于宣传动员工作较彻底，故夏征工作进行得比较顺利。但也有个别地区宣传政策、发动群众、纠正偏向均不够深入、及时，有些干部存在单纯任务观点，嫌麻烦、图省事或单纯图快，因而产生了以简单行政命令进行夏征的偏向。有的并实行平均摊派，违反了多生产多打粮食不多出负担的奖励生产政策。更有少数村乡干部和农民代表，存在着本位自私的观念，自己瞒田或集体瞒田，造成了公粮负担的畸轻畸重现象，引起群众的不满，使夏征绕了弯路。
    入仓工作，大部地区事先都作了周密计划和充分准备；仓库也认真地检查粮质，故各地入仓公粮一般较干净，而送粮秩序也很好。但也有部分地区入仓前缺乏宣传动员与具体检查，发生了秩序混乱、粮湿、含糠、含土及生虫现象。少数仓库事先忽视了准备工作，缺乏具体计划与组织，不能保证随到随收，加以干部作风生硬，引起群众不满，以致个别地区在收粮中发现群众打干部的现象。如叶县第二分仓收粮中，粮仓干部被打伤四名。上述入仓工作中的偏向，现正进行或已经纠正。
