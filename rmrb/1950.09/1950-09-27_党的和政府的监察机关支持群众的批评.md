Party and Government Supervisory Organs Support Mass Criticism

　　The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee’s "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" stipulates: After criticism is published in newspapers and publications, "if the criticized party refuses to express their attitude, or retaliates against the critic, the Party's Discipline Inspection Commission should handle the matter. If the aforementioned circumstances violate administrative discipline and laws, the state supervisory organs and judicial organs should handle them." In order to implement this decision, the Changjiang Daily published a letter exchange between the newspaper and the Central-South Military and Political Committee's People's Supervisory Committee regarding this issue on August 31.

　　In its letter to the Central-South Region People's Supervisory Committee, the Changjiang Daily pointed out that since the launch of criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers, most of the criticized organs or individuals have been able to publicly respond and conduct self-examination based on the criticism in the newspapers, and formulate measures to improve their work. "However, some organs or individuals have adopted an attitude of ignoring the criticism in the newspapers… some have even ignored repeated letters urging a response. As a result, a phenomenon of criticism without response has formed, preventing the public's criticism from achieving its due effect, and will invisibly reduce the people's active concern and supervision of the government's work, affecting the further close relationship between the government and the people." Therefore, they suggested to the Central-South Military and Political Committee: "For criticism manuscripts from readers directed at government organs or individuals, on the day of publication in this newspaper, we will directly send a letter to the criticized party, attaching a clipping of the original criticism, and setting a deadline for a response to the newspaper; if no response is received by the deadline, it will be announced in the newspaper, and another deadline will be given for a response. If they still ignore it, or deliberately delay without responding or handling the matter, we will not only submit it to the criticized party's superior leadership organ for handling, but also intend to report it to the Central-South Military and Political Committee's People's Supervisory Committee and request the Supervisory Committee to accept and resolve it."

　　The Central-South People's Supervisory Committee fully supported this suggestion. In their reply, they expressed their support for and earnest implementation of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee's decision on launching criticism and self-criticism, and decided that "in addition to continuing to conduct in-depth and extensive propaganda and education on criticism and self-criticism among Party members, government personnel, and the masses, in accordance with the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, so that government personnel consciously appreciate the important significance of this work, and create a large-scale mass supervision of government actions," they agreed with the measures proposed by the Changjiang Daily. For government organs and personnel who seriously violate policies, laws, and regulations, and harm the interests of the state and the people, after being criticized by the newspaper, and after the aforementioned procedures, if the criticized party repeatedly refuses and ignores it, "it can be formally transferred to this committee for handling, in order to achieve effective and reasonable resolution and strictly enforce administrative discipline. However, if it is a general issue, please forward it to the criticized party's direct superior leadership organ for handling, in order to facilitate direct and rapid resolution of the problem; if it falls within the scope of judicial affairs, please forward it to the procuratorial organ for handling, so as to avoid confusion of responsibilities."

　　This exchange of letters has attracted widespread attention in the Central-South region, and newspapers in various provinces of Central-South have reprinted it. After the Henan Daily reprinted this letter, the Discipline Inspection Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Supervisory Committee of the Henan Provincial People's Government also wrote to the Henan Daily editorial department, similarly expressing their support for criticism and self-criticism in the newspapers. These letters were published in a prominent position on the first page of the Henan Daily on September 15.

　　The Discipline Inspection Committee of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party said in its letter: "Accepting cases of Party organizations and individuals violating the Party Constitution and Party discipline is the responsibility of this committee… In the future, all criticisms and suggestions published by you, whether the criticized party is a Party organization or a Party member individual, must openly conduct self-examination and response in the newspaper. If there is intentional delay or refusal to respond, you can inform its superior Party committee to handle and resolve it, and submit it to this committee for handling at the same time. In addition, we will promptly inspect and handle the major issues and events published."

　　The Henan People's Supervisory Committee said in its letter: "Currently, in some organs and individual cadres in our province, there is still a bad work style of ignoring correct criticism from the masses in the newspapers, and even suppressing the masses from reflecting situations to the newspapers. This phenomenon of suppressing democracy should not be allowed to continue and exist. In order to prevent and overcome the growth and existence of bureaucracy and commandism in all organs and at all levels of cadres, as well as the occurrence of illegal and undisciplined behavior, in the future, if the criticized party still ignores the matter after the procedures you have proposed, please transfer it to this committee for handling. At the same time, we hope that in the future, for relevant major events, please publish them in the newspaper and send them to this committee, so that timely inspection and handling can be carried out… And we hope to strengthen our mutual contact in this work in the future."

　　Since newspapers in various regions have implemented the central decision and launched criticism work, good results have generally been achieved. However, the phenomenon of adopting a bureaucratic attitude towards criticism and suppressing or even retaliating against mass criticism still exists in individual departments in various regions. This is an obstacle to further launching criticism and self-criticism, improving the work of the Party and government, and strengthening the ties between the Party and government and the people. For newspaper workers, to overcome these obstacles, the main thing should be to rely on the newspaper to conduct repeated and continuous publicity and education on the spirit of the central decision, so that the spirit of correct criticism and self-criticism is implemented among the masses; and to carry out necessary struggles against serious resistance, suppression, and retaliation. Comrade Stalin pointed out in his article "On Worker Correspondents": "Persecuting worker correspondents is a barbaric act, a remnant of bourgeois habits. The newspaper itself should be responsible for protecting its correspondents from persecution, because only the newspaper can stir up a sharp, revealing agitation against reactionary obscurantism." For newspaper workers, in order to overcome the obstacles in launching criticism, they should first play this role of public opinion, rely on the masses, and rely on the supervisory power of public opinion to implement correct criticism and self-criticism.

　　Of course, the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee and the government's People's Supervisory Committee have the responsibility to support correct criticism in the newspapers, and have the responsibility to inspect and handle whether a certain Party organization or a certain Party member, or a government organ and its staff, have violated the Party Constitution, Party discipline, or government discipline and laws. In this regard, it is an important way for newspapers to proactively maintain close contact and cooperation with the Party's Discipline Inspection Committee and the government's People's Supervisory Committee to obtain the assistance of these organs and ensure the effectiveness of criticism. The Changjiang Daily and Henan Daily have already done this, which is of great significance for implementing correct criticism and self-criticism.

### 党的和政府的监察机关支持群众的批评

　　党的和政府的监察机关支持群众的批评
    中共中央《关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定》中规定：在报纸刊物发表了批评意见之后，“如被批评者拒绝表示态度，或对批评者加以打击，即应由党的纪律检查委员会加以处理，上述情事，触犯行政纪律和法律的部分，应由国家监察机关和司法机关予以处理。”为了执行这一决定，长江日报在八月三十一日发表了该报与中南军政委员会人民监察委员会关于这一问题的往来函件。
    长江日报在给中南区人民监察委员会的信中指出，自从报纸上展开了批评和自我批评之后，大部分被批评的机关或个人都能自动根据报纸上的批评进行公开答复和检讨，并订出改进工作的办法。“但也有些机关或个人，则对报纸上的批评抱置之不理的态度，……有的甚至数次去信催促也不答复。因之，形成有批评无答复的现象，使群众的批评收不到应有的效果，无形中将会降低人民对政府工作的积极关心和监督，而影响政府和人民关系的更进一步的密切。”因此，他们向中南军政委员会建议：“读者对政府机关或个人的批评稿件，在本报发表的当天，我们将直接给被批评者去信，将批评原文剪报附去，并限定其足可答复的日期，给报纸复信；如到期不回信，即在报纸上公布，再给予限期请其答复，如到期仍置之不理，或故意拖延不加答复和处理，我们除送交被批评者的上级领导机关处理外，并拟向中南军政委员会人民监察委员会提出检举，请求监察委员会受理解决。”
    中南人民监察委员会完全支持了这一建议。他们在复信中表示拥护与认真贯彻执行中共中央关于展开批评和自我批评的决定，并决定“除了还应该遵照中共中央的指示，在党内外政府公务人员以及群众中继续深入广泛进行批评和自我批评的宣传教育，使政府公务人员自觉体会这一工作的重要意义，造成大规模的群众性的监督政府行动外，”同意长江日报所提的办法，对政府机关和公务人员有严重违犯政策法令和损害国家人民利益事件，经报纸批评，并经前述的程序，而被批评者再三拒绝，置之不理时，“可正式移交本委处理，以求有效合理之解决，严整行政纪律。但如系一般问题，则请转交被批评者直接上级领导机关处理，以便于直接迅速解决问题；如系属司法范围，则请转交检查机关处理，以免混乱责任。”
    这个来往函件在中南地区引起了广泛的重视，中南各省的报纸多已加以转载。河南日报转载了这个函件之后，中共河南省委纪律检查委员会和河南省人民政府人民监察委员会也写信给河南日报编辑部，同样作了支持报纸上的批评和自我批评的表示。这些函件发表在九月十五日河南日报第一版的显著地位。
    中共河南省委纪律检查委员会在信中说：“受理党的组织与个人违犯党章、党纪的行为是本会应尽的责任。……今后凡经你们刊登的批评和建议，被批评的无论是党的组织或党员个人，均必须公开的在报纸上检讨答复，如有故意拖延或拒绝答复者，你们可一面转告其上级党委处理解决，一面提交本会处理，同时我们对所刊登的重大问题与事件，当即检查处理。”
    河南人民监察委员会在信中说：“目前我省在有的机关及个别干部中，仍有对群众在报纸上正确的批评，抱置之不理甚至压制群众向报纸反映情况的恶劣作风，这种压制民主的现象，是不容其继续发展和存在的，为了防止和克服一切机关及各级干部中之官僚主义命令主义的滋长和存在，以及违法乱纪行为的发生，今后凡经过你们所提的办法程序以后，被批评者仍置之不理时，请转交本会处理。同时希望今后有关重大事件，请一面在报纸上公布，一面寄交本会，以便及时进行检查处理。……并希今后在这一工作中加强我们彼此的联系。”
    自从各地报纸执行中央决定，开展批评工作以来，一般地已有了很好的收获。但对批评采取官僚主义态度，对群众的批评采取压制甚至报复手段的现象，在各地的个别部门依然存在。这是进一步开展批评和自我批评、改进党和政府的工作、密切党和政府与人民群众的联系的障碍。对于报纸工作者来说，要克服这些障碍，主要的应该依靠报纸对中央决定的精神进行反复不断的宣传教育，使正确的批评和自我批评的精神贯彻到群众中去；并对于严重的抗拒、压制和报复的行为进行必要的斗争。斯大林同志在《论工人通讯员》一文中指出：“迫害工人通讯员是野蛮行为，是资产阶级习气的残余。保护自己的通讯员不受迫害，应当由报纸本身负责，因为只有报纸才能掀起剧烈的揭发性的鼓动来反对反动的蒙昧主义。”对于报纸工作者来说，为了克服展开批评中的障碍，首先便应该发挥这种人民舆论的作用，依靠群众，依靠舆论的监督力量，来贯彻正确的批评和自我批评。
    当然，党的纪律检查委员会和政府的人民监察委员会有责任支持报纸上的正确批评，有责任检查和处理党的某一组织或某一党员、或者政府机关及其工作人员是否违犯党章党纪或政纪法令。在这方面，报纸主动与党的纪律检查委员会和政府的人民监察委员会保持密切的联系和合作，是取得这些机关的帮助和保证批评的有效性的重要办法。长江日报和河南日报已经这样做了，这对于贯彻正确的批评和自我批评是有重要意义的。
