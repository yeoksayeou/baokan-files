　　The Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly opens today at Flushing Meadow in New York.

　　Since the day the United Nations, this international organization, adopted and signed its Charter in San Francisco on June 26, 1945, people all over the world have placed great hope in it for maintaining international peace and security. The four major purposes explicitly stated in the opening articles of its Charter are also in line with this hope. Unfortunately, for five years, despite the active maintenance by the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, the development of the imperialist aggression policies of the US-British bloc, with their rampant tactics of deception, has been strangling the United Nations and turning it into a tool for openly carrying out imperialist wars. Obviously, during the period when the Soviet Union was absent and our country could not attend the Security Council, American imperialism had cunningly stolen the name of the United Nations to launch an imperialist war of aggression against Korea. In the five years of the United Nations, especially after the Fourth General Assembly, under the control of the US-British bloc, the achievements of its actual actions rarely matched the specific content stated in its purposes. However, the spirit of the Charter and the direction it indicates are still supported by peace-loving people all over the world, and the United Nations organization is still cherished and strived to be salvaged by peace-loving people all over the world.

　　The international situation during the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly is precisely when the US-British bloc is frantically preparing for war, when the US imperialist aggression against Korea is being carried out wildly, but also when the peace movement of the peace camp around the world continues to grow. The struggle between war and peace will inevitably be reflected in the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and it will inevitably be reflected in the achievements of the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly itself. Will it continue to serve the US-British imperialist war of aggression under the further control of the US-British bloc? Or will it, under the supervision of the people of the world and through the efforts of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, Belarus, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, turn to return to the spirit of the Charter of maintaining international peace and security? It will inevitably have to make a choice. Of course, peace-loving people all over the world will resolutely oppose the first prospect and strive for the second.

　　In the year after the Fourth General Assembly, the United Nations, under the control of the US-British bloc, did two of the most shameful things. The first is the unreasonable obstruction of the legal representatives of the People's Republic of China from attending the United Nations and its various agencies; the second is to use the name of the United Nations to carry out the war of aggression against Korea for US imperialism.

　　On November 15, 1949, during the Fourth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and since then, Foreign Minister Zhou of our Central People's Government has repeatedly sent telegrams to the United Nations, solemnly demanding the expulsion of the "representatives" of the Kuomintang remnants, notifying the list of representatives appointed by our country to attend the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, other specialized agencies, and the most recent Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, and declaring that our country's representatives should attend the United Nations and participate in the meetings and work of various United Nations organizations. But from the Security Council onwards, except for the Universal Postal Union, all United Nations organizations have failed to take a method that conforms to international obligations to accept this just and reasonable proposition. Due to the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, the Chinese people have fundamentally overthrown the general representative of the interests of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—the Kuomintang government. The People's Republic of China, which has been solidly established with the support of all Chinese people and all nationalities, has been solemnly announced by Chairman Mao as the "sole legal government representing the people of the whole country of the People's Republic of China" as early as October 1, 1949. The People's Republic of China, as a sovereign state, is fully equipped with the conditions from all aspects. However, the United Nations has always refused to allow the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend various meetings of the United Nations, and has always allowed the so-called "representatives" of a small group of traitors despised by the people of China to remain in the United Nations, does this have any reason? China is a large Asian country with a population of 475 million. As an international organization, the United Nations, as a United Nations that discusses world affairs, refuses to allow the legal representatives of the People's Republic of China, representing a large Asian country, to attend, and allows the pseudo-"representatives" who do not represent any Chinese people to usurp the seat of "representatives" and remain in the United Nations, does this have any reason? The reason why the representatives of the People's Republic of China should attend the United Nations and the "representatives" of the Kuomintang remnants should be expelled from the United Nations does not need to be cited from other sources, and even United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has long been unable to deny it. However, until today, the representatives of the United States and Britain are still sitting hand in hand with Jiang Tingfu, and Jiang Tingfu is still following behind the representatives of the United States and Britain with great respect. Naturally, everyone knows that this is the result of the manipulation of American imperialism.

　　At the Fourth General Assembly, there was the so-called "accusation against the Soviet Union" by the "representatives" of the Kuomintang remnants. Although it was ridiculed by the people of the world and strongly refuted by the Soviet representatives, although the General Assembly did not have the face to discuss it and transferred it to the "Little Assembly," although the "Little Assembly" only perfunctorily held a meeting for ten minutes in February of this year, this agenda has been put into the Fifth General Assembly again. This agenda is baseless. Because without the attendance of representatives of the People's Republic of China, there can be no Chinese proposals. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance in February 1950 has completely eliminated any arguments for the "accusation against the Soviet Union." The Chinese people and their country are fully friendly with the Soviet people and their country. Any attempt to instigate by using this proposal cannot damage the close unity and mutual assistance of the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union in the slightest.

　　One day that the representatives of the People's Republic of China cannot attend the General Assembly of the United Nations and other various meetings, one day that the People's Republic of China does not recognize any motions involving China made by such organizations and meetings; the People's Republic of China determines that those resolutions are illegal and therefore invalid; the People's Republic of China must reserve the right to take its own actions on these issues.

　　Regarding the Korean issue, the United Nations, since the Second General Assembly was raped by Marshall to propose and pass the establishment of the Korean Commission, has been complying with the will of American imperialism. Throughout the Third General Assembly and the Fourth General Assembly, pig-style elections invented by Cao Kun of China were carried out, Li Chengwan, who had been living in the United States for 27 years and had American citizenship, was cultivated, the progressive movement in South Korea was suppressed, armed provocations against North Korea were carried out, and before the Fifth General Assembly, it reached its peak by organizing the "United Nations Army" under the command of the American warmonger MacArthur to launch a large-scale attack on Korea. This series of crimes of interfering in the internal affairs of Korea and armed aggression against Korea, the United Nations passed illegal resolutions under the control of US imperialism. Especially in June and July, during the period when the Soviet representatives did not attend and the Chinese representatives could not attend the Security Council, the ugly things were done even more shamelessly. After searching through the Charter of the United Nations, one cannot find a clause in which the United Nations has the power to launch an armed attack on a peaceful country. Naturally, everyone knows that this was done by the bloody hands of the American imperialists, and Secretary-General Lie voluntarily acted as the pitiful Emperor Xian of Han, and also sent his own liaison officer; also, one after another, as Secretary-General, he urged MacArthur "Marshal" to collect cannon fodder. The Korean issue at the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly, according to the report of the Korean Commission drafted by the US State Department, will strengthen the aggression against Korea, will greatly scold those countries that rely on the United States for food because of their poor performance in sending troops, and will make the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea more "United Nations-ized." But the people of the world have conscience, have eyes, and the sympathy of the people of the world is on the side of Korea, not on the side of the American aggressors. The US imperialists launched the aggression against Korea, and thereby invaded China's territory of Taiwan under the pretext of "neutralization", and made the air force invading Korea intrude into China's northeastern airspace. We have accused the United Nations Security Council of this. The US imperialists, by using the aggression against Korea, greatly infringed upon our country's sovereignty and threatened our country's security. If the United Nations is still like the United Nations, it should make another resolution to condemn the atrocities of the US imperialists, stop the aggression of the US imperialists, force the US army, navy, and air force to withdraw from Korea, and allow the Korean internal affairs to be resolved by the Korean people themselves; and condemn the US imperialists for expanding the war of aggression against Korea to the crime of infringing on our country's territory, territorial waters, and airspace. Only in this way can it conform to the solemn purpose of the United Nations Charter; and only in this way can it maintain international peace and security, especially peace and security in the Far East.

　　China before October 1, 1949, and China after, must be viewed separately in world history. If the United Nations, under the control of American imperialism, continues to ignore this major distinction, ignores the importance of China after October 1, 1949, to world affairs, and ignores China's huge power in maintaining peace in the Far East, and attempts to exclude it from any international organization and world affairs, then the United Nations will become the New York office of the US State Department and Department of Defense, then the spirit and purpose of the United Nations Charter will be completely destroyed by American imperialism. The Chinese people and the people of the world will resolutely oppose such reckless actions by the imperialist bloc.

### 联合国第五届大会和它的前途

　　联合国第五届大会和它的前途
    联合国第五届大会今天在纽约佛拉辛草地开幕。
    联合国这个国际组织，自一九四五年六月二十六日在美国旧金山宪章通过签字之日起，全世界的人民是寄以极大的维持国际和平及安全的希望的，其宪章开宗明义所标载的四大宗旨，也是符合于这一希望的。可惜五年以来，虽有苏联和捷克与波兰的积极维护，但由于美英集团的帝国主义侵略政策的发展，大肆其偷天换日的手段，正把联合国加以扼杀，而把它变为一个公开进行帝国主义战争的工具。显然的，在苏联不出席与我国不能出席安全理事会的时期，美国帝国主义已奸诈地盗窃了联合国的名义，去发动侵略朝鲜的帝国主义战争。联合国五年以来，特别是四届大会以后，在美英集团多数操纵之下，其实际行动的成就，和它的宗旨所标明的具体内容，很少有相符之处。可是，宪章的精神和它标示的方向还是全世界爱好和平的人民所拥护的，联合国组织还是全世界爱好和平的人民所爱惜而力图加以挽救的。
    联合国第五届大会时期的国际局势，正是美英集团疯狂准备战争的时候，正是美帝侵朝战争疯狂进行的时候，但也是和平阵营的全世界和平运动继续增涨的时候，战争与和平的斗争，必然在联合国第五届大会上反映出来，也必然在联合国第五届大会的本身成就上反映出来。它还是在美英集团多数操纵之下，更进一步继续为美英帝国主义的侵略战争服务？它还是在全世界人民的监督之下，在苏联、乌克兰、白俄罗斯、捷克与波兰的努力之下，转而回复宪章维持国际和平与安全的精神？它必将有所抉择。当然，全世界爱好和平的人民，必将坚决反对第一个前途，力争第二个前途。
    联合国在第四届大会以后的一年中，在美英集团多数操纵之下做了两个最可耻的事。第一是对于中华人民共和国合法代表出席联合国及其各种机构的无理阻挠；第二是以联合国的名义替美帝进行侵略朝鲜的战争。
    一九四九年十一月十五日，正在联合国第四届大会会期中，自从那时起，我国中央人民政府周外长迭次致电联合国，严正地要求驱逐国民党残匪的“代表”，通知了我国委派出席安全理事会、经社理事会、托管理事会、其他各专门机构与最近联合国第五届大会的代表名单，声明我国代表应该出席联合国并参加联合国各种组织的会议和工作。但从安全理事会起，除了万国邮政联盟之外，所有联合国组织，都没有采取一个合乎国际义务的办法，来接受这个正义的合理的主张。由于中国人民解放战争的胜利，中国人民已把那帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义利益的总代表——国民党政府根本打倒了；得到全中国人民与各民族拥护的中华人民共和国已经巩固地建立起来了；我中央人民政府“为代表中华人民共和国全国人民的唯一合法政府”，早在一九四九年十月一日就为毛主席所庄严地公告了。中华人民共和国之为一个主权国家，无论从那方面来看，其条件都是具备无缺的。而联合国始终拒绝中华人民共和国的代表团出席联合国的各种会议，始终让那个被全中国人民所唾弃的一小撮叛国分子的所谓“代表”，留在联合国内，这难道有丝毫理由吗？中国是拥有四万七千五百万人口的亚洲大国，作为一个国际组织的联合国，作为一个讨论世界事务的联合国，拒绝代表亚洲大国的中华人民共和国的合法代表的出席，而让那个不代表任何中国人民的伪“代表”，僭窃“代表”的席位，留在联合国内，这难道有丝毫理由吗？中华人民共和国的代表之应出席联合国，国民党残匪“代表”之应驱逐出联合国，其理由完全用不着旁征博引，就连联合国秘书长赖伊先生也早已无法否认了。但是，直到今天，美英的代表们还是和蒋廷黻拉手附耳地坐在一块，蒋廷黻依然打恭作揖地跟在美英代表的屁股后面，自然，谁都知道，这是美国帝国主义一手把持的结果。
    在第四届大会上有所谓国民党残匪“代表”的“控苏案”，虽然遭受到全世界人民的嘲笑与苏联代表的严词驳斥，虽然大会也没面孔讨论而转到“小型联大”，虽然“小型联大”一年当中也仅在今年二月间在会议上敷衍了十来分钟，但这个议程又被放进第五届大会了。这个议程是毫无根据的。因为没有中华人民共和国代表的出席，就决不能有中国的提案，一九五零年二月中苏友好同盟互助条约的签定，已完全肃清了该“控苏案”的任何论据，中国人民和它的国家与苏联人民和它的国家是充分地友好的，任何利用这一提案进行挑拨的企图，都不能丝毫地损伤中苏两大民族的亲密团结与互相帮助。
    中华人民共和国的代表，一天不能出席联合国大会及其他各种会议，中华人民共和国就一天也不承认那样的组织及会议所作的任何涉及中国问题的议案；中华人民共和国断定那些决议都是非法的，因而也是无效的；中华人民共和国就一定要保留在这些问题上采取自己的行动的权利。
    联合国对于朝鲜问题，自第二届大会被马歇尔所强奸而提出并通过成立朝鲜委员会之后，一直在顺从着美国帝国主义的意旨。通过第三届大会、第四届大会的整个时期，进行了中国曹锟发明的猪仔式选举，培植着居留美国二十七年有美国国籍的李承晚，镇压了南朝鲜的进步运动，进行了对北朝鲜的武装挑衅，发展到第五届大会之前，登峰造极地组织了“联合国军队”，由美国战争贩子麦克阿瑟挂帅，大举进攻朝鲜。这一连串的干涉朝鲜内政和武装侵略朝鲜的罪行，联合国都在美帝国主义的控制下通过了非法的决议。特别在六七月间，苏联代表没有出席与中国代表不能出席安全理事会的期间，丑事就做得更加无耻。查遍联合国的宪章，找不出一条联合国有武装攻击一个和平国家的条文。自然，谁都知道这是美国帝国主义者的血手干出来的，而赖伊先生却自愿地扮作可怜的汉献帝，还派出他自己的联络员；还接二连三地以秘书长资格替麦克阿瑟“元帅”催索炮灰。联合国第五届大会上的朝鲜问题，照美国国务院代拟的朝鲜委员会的报告，必将加强对朝鲜的侵略，必将对那些靠美国吃饭的国家之出兵不力，大肆吆喝一顿，必将把美帝侵略朝鲜的战争更加“联合国化”。但是全世界的人民是有良心的，是有眼睛的，全世界人民的同情是在朝鲜方面，而不是在美国侵略者方面。美帝发动侵略朝鲜，并从而借口“中立化”来侵略中国领土的台湾，并使侵朝的空军侵入中国东北领空，我们已向联合国安全理事会加以控诉了。美帝利用对于朝鲜的侵略，大大地侵犯了我国的主权，威胁了我国的安全。联合国如果还像联合国的话，它应该另行做一个决议，谴责美帝的暴行，制止美帝的侵略，强制美国的海陆空军撤出朝鲜，使朝鲜内政由朝鲜人民自己解决；并谴责美帝由侵略朝鲜的战争扩大到侵犯我国领土、领海、领空的罪行。只有这样，才能符合联合国宪章的庄严宗旨；也只有这样，才能维持国际和平及安全，特别是远东的和平及安全。
    一九四九年十月一日以前的中国，和以后的中国，在世界历史上，必须分开来看。如果联合国在美国帝国主义的操纵之下，继续漠视这一个重大的分别，漠视一九四九年十月一日以后的中国对于世界事务的重要性，并漠视中国在维持远东和平的巨大力量，而企图把它排拒在任何国际组织与世界事务之外，那么，联合国就变成美国国务院与国防部在纽约的办事处，那么，联合国宪章的精神和宗旨，就将完全被美国帝国主义所毁灭。中国人民和全世界的人民，将坚决反对帝国主义集团这样的胡作非为。
