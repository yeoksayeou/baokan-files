    Speed Up Production to Greet the National Day
　　China Chang Railway Employees Exceed This Season's Task
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily: Employees of all departments of the China Chang Railway Bureau have been actively engaged in a production competition to welcome National Day, and have exceeded the third quarter's tasks ahead of schedule. They are now seizing the last few days of September to strive to exceed more tasks as a gift for National Day.
    While announcing the eight-month production and financial plan, the leadership of the bureau put forward sixteen guarantee conditions, which were actively responded to by all employees, who proposed specific methods to guarantee the completion and launched a production competition. The employees demonstrated a high level of work enthusiasm in the competition, practiced careful calculation, and strived to complete the third quarter's production and financial plan ahead of schedule to welcome National Day. Most units have now achieved results. For example, the Mudanjiang Third Branch won first place among the five branches in August, completed 126% of its loading task, and eliminated major accidents throughout the month. From August 20th to September 12th, the Shenyang Train Section's train freight team saved a total of 147 railcars in just 22 days. Shuangchengpu Station strived to save 100 million yuan (Northeast currency) in September as a gift for National Day, and had already saved more than 43.83 million yuan from September 1st to 10th. In particular, the telecommunications department under the Mudanjiang Partition Committee completed the third quarter's work task 35 days ahead of schedule on August 25th, and completed the annual intermediate maintenance task on August 15th. As a result of the employees' efforts, most of the sixteen guarantee conditions put forward by the leadership have been realized to date, achieving the following results:
    Transportation Department: It was originally proposed that the loading volume in August and September should be guaranteed to exceed the original plan by 10%, and the vehicle turnaround rate should be reduced by 2.4 hours from the quarterly plan of 2.25 days. As a result, the loading volume in August exceeded the original plan by 22%, the loading volume in the first ten days of September exceeded by 7.1%, and the vehicle turnaround rate in the first ten days of September was shortened by 0.23 days compared with the quarterly plan.
    Locomotive Department: It was originally proposed to guarantee that the daily car mileage would reach 391.1 kilometers according to the quarterly plan, but it reached 417.4 kilometers in the first ten days of September. The locomotive turnaround rate was 14.8 hours according to the quarterly plan, and was shortened by another 0.5 hours, and has been shortened to 14.3 hours in the first ten days of September. The technical speed was originally planned to be 34 kilometers, but it has been increased to 35.4 kilometers in the first ten days of September. The proportion of cars repaired in the section was 12.6% in July, and has been reduced to 8.8% in the first ten days of September.
    Engineering Department: It was originally proposed to guarantee that the regular maintenance of trunk lines and station lines should exceed the plan by 80 kilometers and guarantee quality. According to the statistics of the first ten days of September, 2778.9 kilometers of trunk lines have been completed, and 21.1 kilometers have not yet been completed. In addition, 23.6 kilometers have not been accepted. 9557 kilometers of station lines have been completed, and 43 kilometers have not been completed, and 46.4 kilometers have not been accepted.
    Telecommunications Department: It was originally proposed to guarantee the completion of the signal overhaul work 30 days ahead of schedule and the completion of the communication intermediate repair work 15 days ahead of schedule, which has now been completed and exceeded as scheduled.
