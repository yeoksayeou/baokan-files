　　Hou Tianlu Has Changed
    The old society turned him into a blind man who only ate, drank, and did nothing. Since liberation, he has transformed into an active worker.
    The blind man Hou Tianlu is from Chengnan West Street, First District, Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province. He was not blind when he was young, and in his youth, he was a good hand at farming, but he was unwilling to work hard. He worked as a patrolman and cavalryman in the reactionary army of the old society. In the old society’s reactionary army, he acquired many bad habits. After returning home, he refused to work again.
    Later, he developed an eye disease and became blind. From then on, he only ate, drank, and did nothing, living a muddled life. His family had no way to make a living, and his mother worried every day, her brow furrowed.
    After Lingchuan was liberated, society changed, and Tianlu gradually changed too. Now, although he is blind, he asks his daughter to lead him to carry water, deliver manure, and even carry coal at the kiln. When it snows, he husks corn, makes brooms, strips hemp, and spins ropes, never idle all day long. When neighbors see him, they all praise him for working hard. He says even more happily: "Now, in the new society, you can’t get by without working. Although I can't see, I can still work hard!" His mother often says happily: "Before liberation, Tianlu had eyes but was unwilling to work! But now, he is blind, and he is willing to work. Before, Tianlu was not good, and I had no heart to live a good life, just wanting to get through one day at a time! Now, I've lived for over forty years, and I still want to live for fifty more!"

　　侯添鹿变了样
    旧社会使他变成吃喝不做事的瞎子，解放以来他又变成积极劳动者。
    瞎子侯添鹿是山西省陵川一区城内西街人。他小时并不瞎眼，年青时还是种地的好把式，就是不肯好好干。他在本地当过巡警，又当过骑兵。在旧社会的反动军队里，他染了许多不良嗜好。回到家后，他再也不肯劳动了。
    后来，他害了眼病，变成了瞎子。从此，他每天吃喝不做事，糊里糊涂地鬼混。家里生活没办法，他母亲天天发愁，眉毛打结。
    陵川解放后，社会变了样，添鹿也慢慢转变了。现在他虽然眼瞎了，但叫他的女儿引他担水、送粪，并且还到窑上担煤，下雪天就剥玉茭、做条帚、剥麻、纺绳、整天不闲。邻家见了，都夸奖他劳动好。他更高兴地说：“现在新社会里，不劳动是吃不开了。我虽是看不见了，可是出气力干活我还能行呀！”他母亲常常高兴地说：“解放前，添鹿有眼还不肯劳动呢！可是现在，他瞎了眼，也肯劳动了。以前添鹿不好，我也无心好好过活，光想对付一天算一天！现在呢，我活了四十几岁了，还想活五十年哩。”
