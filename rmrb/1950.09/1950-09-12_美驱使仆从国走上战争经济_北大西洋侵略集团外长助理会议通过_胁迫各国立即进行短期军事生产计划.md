　　US Drives Vassal States Towards War Economy
    North Atlantic Aggression Group Assistant Foreign Ministers' Meeting Approves
    Coercion of Nations to Immediately Implement Short-Term Military Production Plans
    [Xinhua News Agency, August 8th] The second meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Assistant Foreign Ministers, which began on August 22nd in London, concluded on September 2nd. According to a press release issued on the 4th, the United States has forced its vassal states to adopt a short-term plan prioritizing arms production, compelling each signatory nation to: "Fully utilize existing capabilities, immediately place orders for the various types of specialized equipment and materials most urgently needed by the forces to be established under the military plans each nation has adopted." This plan will be forcefully submitted to the governments of each nation for implementation. As the Associated Press stated: "Each of the delegates is taking back to their own government a powerful recommendation." The chairman of the meeting, U.S. representative Spofford, also urged at a press conference on the 4th that "orders for the urgently needed equipment specified in the plan should begin to be placed within the next two or three weeks."

    This so-called short-term plan was proposed by the United States because it felt that its vassal states were moving too slowly in expanding their arms and preparing for war. Even before this meeting, on August 12th, the United States Information Service quoted so-called well-informed sources in Washington, which in reality meant the opinion of the U.S. government, saying: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Assistant Foreign Ministers' meeting is planning to have signatory nations begin a new short-term military production plan within the next two or three weeks, without waiting for the passage of new military budgets in each nation." Therefore, this short-term plan that has been adopted is only the beginning of the United States' preparations to have its vassal states fully transition to a war economy. The press release clearly announced that the so-called "priority plan should be reflected in long-term production and financial plans." Spofford further emphasized that the vassal states' promises regarding their military expansion were "insufficient in terms of manpower, financial resources, and material resources," and stressed that the memoranda on rearmament given to the United States by each nation "should not be regarded as the final statement regarding the measures each nation is willing to take." In order to implement a plan that could satisfy the United States' demands, the meeting's press release brazenly demanded an attack on the people's living standards, stating: "Further efforts and sacrifices remain necessary." Spofford also yelled wildly: "Further increases in social services must be delayed."

    Both the meeting's press release and Spofford declared that the meeting had conducted urgent discussions on the following two issues: The first was the so-called strengthening of military institutions, namely the issue of merging the Western European Union into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and establishing a unified supreme command; the second was the so-called resolution of the financial problems of rearmament and the collective use of national resources (i.e., implementing the Schuman Plan). However, neither of these issues yielded results. Regarding the latter issue, Spofford revealed: "None of the various proposals for maintaining the Atlantic military plan were adopted." This indicates that the United States' primary goal of turning Western Europe into a military base, the so-called "integration" of Western Europe that has been constantly proposed since last winter, continues to encounter resistance from its vassal states and has suffered yet another setback.

　　美驱使仆从国走上战争经济
    北大西洋侵略集团外长助理会议通过
    胁迫各国立即进行短期军事生产计划
    【新华社八日讯】八月二十二日起在伦敦举行的北大西洋侵略集团外长助理会议第二次会议，已于九月二日闭会。据四日发表的会议公报透露，美国在会上已强使其仆从国家通过一项优先生产军火的短期计划，胁迫各签字国：“充分利用现有能力，立即订购根据各该国所通过的军事计划拟建立的部队所最急需的种种特殊装备物资。”这一计划将以强力提交各国政府执行。如合众社所称：“代表们每人都为他们自己的政府带回了一项大力的建议”。而会议主席，美国代表斯波福，还在四日记者招待会上力促“计划中指定的急需装备，能在今后两三周内即开始订购”。
    这个所谓短期计划，是美国认为各仆从国在扩军备战方面动作过于迟缓而提出来的，早在此次会议以前，美国新闻处即于八月十二日引所谓华盛顿消息灵通方面，实即美国政府方面的意见称：“北大西洋公约外长助理会议正计划使签字国在今后两三周内着手进行新的短期军事生产计划，不必待各国新军费预算通过。”因此，这次通过的短期计划还只是美国准备使其仆从国家全面走上战争经济的开端。公报明白宣布：所谓“优先计划，应体现于长期的生产与财政计划中”。斯波福更强调各仆从国家在他们扩军的诺言中，“人力、财力、物力三方面都不够”，并强调各国就重整军备给予美国的备忘录“不得认为是关于各国所愿采取之措施的最后申述”。为了实行能满足美国要求的计划，会议公报悍然要求向人民生活水平实行进攻称：“更进一步努力与牺牲仍属必要。”斯波福也狂叫：“社会服务方面更多的增加必须予以迟延。”
    会议公报与斯波福都宣称：会议曾就下面两个问题进行紧急讨论，第一个是所谓加强军事机构，即把西欧联盟合并入北大西洋公约并成立统一的最高司令部的问题，第二个是所谓解决重整军备的财政问题与集体使用各国资源（亦即实行舒曼计划）的问题。但是都未能获致结果。关于后一问题，斯波福曾透露：“维持大西洋军事计划所需费用的各种建议，没有一个被采纳。”这就表示美国使西欧军事基地化的主要目标，即自去冬以来就不断提出的所谓使西欧“整体化”的目标，仍然继续遇到其仆从国家的抵抗而遭受了又一次的挫折。
