Editor's Note: In the rectification movement, how different departments determine the content of rectification in their own departments based on their work and characteristics, as well as the significance and role of leading cadres taking charge and doing it themselves, are well explained in this article. Excerpts from the original text are as follows:

The directly subordinate departments of the CPC Central Committee's Central South Bureau and the Central South Military and Political Committee are different from the provincial, municipal, and county-level organs. Their characteristics are: cadres are more concentrated, and there are more leading cadres; and they do not directly interact with the broad masses, but can only come into contact with the broad masses through various levels of organs and cadres. The general tasks are to understand the situation, grasp and formulate policies, and guide their implementation within the entire region. These characteristics are obviously different from lower-level organs and cadres working in lower-level organs. Therefore, the content, methods, steps, and time allocation in the rectification must also be different from those of lower-level organs and lower-level party member cadres. For example, the most prominent commandism style among some lower-level cadres is not easily found in the directly subordinate organs because the cadres do not directly contact the broad masses. However, due to insufficient understanding of the situation below, it is inevitable that the formulation of policies, the proposal of plans, and the arrangement of tasks will not be in line with the actual situation below, which is often one of the root causes of the occurrence and development of commandism. Therefore, the opposition to commandism in the directly subordinate departments needs to start from this aspect, and cannot mechanically seek out facts of direct command to the masses, which is obvious.

So, how should rectification be carried out in the directly subordinate departments? We believe:

First, each department must summarize the central work according to its own tasks. For example: whether the central link is often grasped in one's own work arrangements, instead of being entangled in trivial matters all day long; whether the formulation of policies is in line with the spirit of the central government's policies and combined with the actual situation below; whether the partiality in the implementation below has been fueled due to the imperfections in the allocation of policies, plans, and tasks. Based on these main aspects, a careful examination of the work of one's own department for a period of time—for example, half a year or a year—should be carried out and a summary made. This will not only improve future work, but also enable the cadres of each department to improve in the summary work. That is to say, removing various forms of bureaucracy ensures the accuracy of the department's leadership. It must be recognized that this kind of summary starts from the department's tasks and its central work, and definitely does not start from personal life and trivial matters.

Since the cadres of the directly subordinate departments are relatively concentrated and have a deeper understanding of each other, the connection between the heads of the departments and the working cadres should be very close. Therefore, it is easier and more necessary to implement the method of "the head is responsible and personally takes action" in such departments. That is, the head of the department must take the lead in summarizing the work and conducting a review. The purpose of taking the lead is, on the one hand, to eliminate the concerns of the cadres below about the criticism from the leadership, and more importantly, to enlighten the thinking of the cadres below and point out the direction for conducting the review, so that the summary of the work can follow a correct center. Such a leading role can also enable the heads of departments to experience whether the initiative of the lower levels has been fully utilized in the daily work of the department, whether frequent close relations have been maintained with the lower-level departments, whether the lower-level departments have been frequently guided, and whether they have frequently helped them solve the difficulties in their work. In order to more deeply review the relationship with lower-level departments, opinions from lower-level departments can also be solicited to enrich the content of one's own review. After the head of the department takes the lead in summarizing the review, the cadres of the department are then mobilized to launch a discussion, and finally the head of the department comprehensively summarizes everyone's opinions and makes an accurate summary. In this way, the right and wrong and responsibilities in the work will naturally be clarified in the discussion and summary, which will improve both the upper and lower levels.

In order to achieve the purpose of summarizing departmental work and examining leadership style, in addition to studying the generally prescribed documents, important documents related to one's own department's business must also be added according to different departments as the basis for summarizing the work. This will enable our department's rectification movement to be more closely integrated with our own business and work tasks, and achieve more practical results. Since there are many non-Party members and Party member cadres working together in the directly subordinate departments, mainly the directly subordinate departments under the Central South Military and Political Committee, this adds a specific content to the cadre rectification movement in these departments, that is, it is necessary to correct the incorrect understanding of the united front policy and the incorrect attitude towards non-Party members in the cadres' minds, in order to enhance the close relationship with non-Party members and thoroughly implement the CPC Central Committee's instructions to the whole Party on studying the document "Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communists' Ability to Unite and Cooperate with Non-Party Masses". Only in this way can we consolidate the foundation of the people's democratic united front regime and enable our broad masses of Party member cadres to work hand in hand with non-Party members in the construction of the country.

For the leadership of rectification, it is generally necessary to focus on solving the most prominent problems at the center. It is impossible to rectify all the work of all departments or solve all the problems at once in this rectification. As long as the main problems are solved, the solution of other problems will have smooth conditions.

　　在不同部门中进行整风应有不同的内容方法和步骤
    ——武汉长江日报社论摘要
    编者按：整风运动中，不同部门怎样根据自己工作的情况和特点，确定本部门的整风内容，以及首长负责亲自动手的意义与作用，在这篇文章中都有很好的说明。现将原文摘要如下：
    中共中央中南局和中南军政委员会各直属部门与省、市、县各级机关不同，其特点是：干部比较集中，领导干部较多；并且不是直接地与广大群众发生关系，而是经过各级机关和各级干部才能与广大群众接触。一般的工作任务是了解情况，掌握和制订政策，并在全区的范围内指导其实现。这些特点显然是和下级机关和在下级机关中工作的干部有所不同。因此，在整风的内容、方法、步骤和时间的分配上，亦均须和下级机关与下层党员干部有别。例如在有些下层干部中最突出的命令主义作风，在直属机关中由于干部并不直接和广大群众接触，因此就不易发现直接的命令主义作风的表现。但由于对下面的情况了解不够，对于制订政策，提出计划，布置任务，难免发生与下面实际情况不符之处，这又往往是造成命令主义发生和发展的根源之一。因此在直属部门中的反对命令主义作风就需要从这一方面着手，而不能机械地去寻找对群众直接命令的事实，这是显而易见的。
    那末，在直属部门中究竟应该怎样进行整风呢？我们认为：
    首先各个部门必须根据自己的任务来总结中心工作。例如：在自己的工作布置上是否经常掌握了中心环节，而不是整天纠缠于琐碎事务之中；在制订政策中是否和中央的政策精神相符，是否与下面的实际情况相结合；是否由于政策、计划和任务的分配有未尽善之处而助长了下面执行中的偏向。根据这几个主要方面，把自己部门一个时期的——例如半年或一年的工作进行一次仔细的检查，并作出总结，这不但能使今后的工作获得改进，而且能使各部门的干部在总结工作中获得提高。这就是说去掉了各种形式的官僚主义作风就使部门的领导更保证了其准确性。必须认清这种总结是从部门任务及其中心工作出发的，决不是从个人生活和琐碎事务出发。
    由于直属各部门的干部比较集中，相互了解比较深入，部门的首长和工作干部的联系就应当是很密切的。因此在这样的部门实行“首长负责，亲自动手”的方法进行整风就更易作到和更加必要。即必须是由部门的首长带头总结工作进行检讨。带头的目的一方面可以消除下面干部对于领导上批评的顾虑，而更重要的则是启发下面干部的思想，指出进行检讨的方向。使工作的总结能够遵循着一个正确的中心进行。这样的带头作用还可使部门首长体验出，在本部门的日常工作中是否充分发挥了下级的积极性，是否和下级部门保持经常的密切的关系，是否经常对下级部门进行指导，是否经常帮助他们解决了工作中的困难。为着更深刻地检讨对下级部门的关系，还可征求下级部门的意见以充实自己的检讨内容。经过部门首长的带头总结检讨然后再发动部门的干部展开讨论，最后再由部门首长综合大家意见作出确切的总结。这样，在讨论和总结中自然就明确了工作中的是非和责任，这就会使上下都得到提高。
    为着达到以总结部门工作检查领导作风的目的，除了学习一般规定的文件以外，还须根据不同部门增加与自己部门业务有关的重要文件，作为总结工作的依据。这样就会使我们部门的整风运动更能与自己的业务和工作任务结合起来，而收到更实际的效果。由于在直属部门中，主要是中南军政委员会所属的直属各部门中有不少的党外人士和党员干部在一起共同工作，这就在这些部门的干部整风运动中增加了一个特定的内容，就是必须纠正在干部思想中对于统一战线政策的不正确的认识和对党外人士不正确的态度，以增进与党外人士的密切关系，彻底执行中共中央关于学习“斯大林、毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作”的文件给全党的指示。只有这样，才能巩固人民民主统一战线政权的基础，使我们广大的党员干部在国家建设工作中能够与非党人士携手并进。
    对于整风的领导，一般应该着重解决中心的最突出的问题。希望在这次整风中把所有部门工作整好，或把所有问题一齐解决是不可能的。只要主要问题解决了，其他问题的解决就有了顺利的条作。
