　　Special-Class Female Combat Hero Guo Junqing
    Wang Jinfeng
  (I) Father Froze to Death in a Snowdrift

　　On a windy and snowy night in Lindong County, Rehe, thirteen-year-old Guo Junqing and her mother, draped in a tattered cotton quilt, trembled in the mountain沟 for half the night, searching for her father who had gone up the mountain early in the morning to dig tree stumps for the landlord. The fierce wind carried snowflakes as large as goose palms, hitting their faces directly. The cotton quilt was soaked through, pressing on her back like a block of ice. Little Junqing hadn't eaten all day, and hunger and cold had almost made her lose consciousness. When she heard her mother howling "her father," and opened her eyes, she saw her father lying frozen in a snowdrift, his hand clutching the iron pickaxe for digging tree stumps, beside him a tree stump covered with snow.

　　Her mother knelt before the landlord Meng Dechen, weeping and begging to borrow some food. Meng Dechen stood at the door, glancing at the cart with a sneer and began to curse. Little Junqing felt sorry for her father and also for her mother, spat on the ground, and pulled her mother away.

　　Her father lay on the kang for five days unable to move. Meng Dechen, carrying a horsewhip, relentlessly forced him to work, forcing him to pay back the money. Little Junqing couldn't bear it any longer and began to scold him at the top of her voice. Her father also responded a few times from the kang, and this scolding brought disaster.

　　In the snow, which was knee-deep, her father was dragged away by the police barefoot, not even having time to put on his shoes. Her mother collected all the pots, pans, bowls, and spoons in the house and sold them. She presented the shining silver dollars to Meng Dechen with both hands. Her half-dead father died less than three days after being brought home. From then on, little Junqing bore this irreconcilable hatred against the landlords.

　　Mending city walls, repairing nurseries, doing odd jobs, Guo Junqing did everything to support her mother.

　　But life was still impossible. Guo Junqing and her mother, along with her younger brother, begged all the way to Linxi. The landlord's family sneered from the side: "See her walking to her death!"

  (II) Enlisting in the Eighth Route Army

　　The hard-boned Guo Junqing didn't walk to her death, but found a way to live.

　　After the "August 15th" Northeast Liberation, the Soviet Red Army entered Linxi City, Rehe. Guo Junqing suddenly saw female soldiers in the Red Army on the street. She was both surprised and happy. "Girls can be soldiers too?!" She thought, "My parents didn't raise me in vain, I can still be a soldier to avenge my father!"

　　Draped in a tattered fur coat, wearing torn cotton pants, and with a "child's hairstyle," fourteen-year-old Guo Junqing went to the Eighth Route Army to enlist. The first time, they didn't accept her because she was too young. The second time, she changed her name to Guo Fu, exaggerated her age by two years, pretended to be a boy, and put on a yellow cotton military uniform and became a soldier.

　　"This is a way to live," she thought happily, eating her fill and wearing warm clothes, "Living on, I can avenge my father!" She entered the Eighth Route Army with such simple class hatred.

　　The Eighth Route Army's grievance-airing movement brightened her eyes even more. "There are many poor people in the world, and there are also many landlords. To avenge my father—we must overthrow the landlord class, overthrow old Chiang!" Just as she was pondering this, she heard the news that her father's murderer, Meng Dechen, had been overthrown by the masses in Lindong County. With tears in her eyes, she said loudly to her comrades: "The Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army avenged me, and all the poor brothers avenged me. I am determined to go to the front to fight old Chiang and avenge all the poor brothers!"

  (III) Fight Old Chiang, Avenge the Blood Feud!

　　Guo Junqing never wavered during the arduous marching and training in the bitterly cold weather of the northern frontier. She practiced bayonet drills with a large-caliber rifle taller than herself, and practiced riding on inferior horses that she couldn't even reach the stirrups on. She fell off the horse and suffered head injuries, and her shoulders were swollen from carrying the large-caliber rifle, but she gritted her teeth without uttering a sound. She understood that she had to learn her skills well to fight old Chiang and avenge the blood feud.

　　Fifteen-year-old Guo Junqing became an excellent cavalry messenger, delivering urgent documents in the snowy nights and under the enemy's fire blockade. As she galloped through the enemy's dense fire net, clinging tightly to the horse's back, she firmly thought: "If I get hit, I'll swallow it immediately. I can die, but I can't let the military documents fall into the hands of the enemy!" Hatred for the class enemy made Guo Junqing a brave soldier.

　　At seventeen, she was a combat squad leader. Her squad performed well in training and was assigned to be a shock squad to capture a large hilltop position outside Pingquan City, Rehe. The defending enemies numbered fifty or sixty, possessing rocket launchers, mountain guns, and heavy machine guns. Her squad only had twelve rifles. The soldiers and she were going into battle for the first time. She knew the seriousness of the task and worried while digging fortifications with the soldiers. The pace of digging fortifications unknowingly slowed down. "Squad leader, are you tired? Let me dig." A soldier took the pickaxe from her hand. Just as she was about to argue, she saw the pickaxe flash and suddenly thought of her father's hand, frozen in the snowdrift, tightly clutching the pickaxe. A surge of anger and grief filled her heart. She fixed her bayonet onto the rifle and vigorously began to dig fortifications.

　　The bugle for the charge sounded. Guo Junqing, holding her bayonet, charged ahead. Three combat teams closely followed her and rushed to the first ridge. The enemy's heavy weapons began firing, rocket launchers, mountain guns, and heavy machine guns roared. Airplanes also appeared in the sky, strafing and shooting. The soldiers were a little flustered. Guo Junqing ordered everyone to scatter and hide, while encouraging them, saying: "Today is the time for us to turn the tables, to fight old Chiang and settle the accounts. Let's strive to perform meritorious service on the front line...." Before she could finish speaking, she felt a daze and her body weakened. Guo Junqing woke up and realized that her period had started. She struggled to crawl to the deputy squad leader's side, instructing him to guard the position. She bent over and ran behind a large rock, her body in so much pain that she could no longer stand up straight. "Guo Junqing, are you going to die here today?" she groaned in her heart, "Die on the battlefield without fighting?" She asked herself, and anger welled up in her heart. "I am a Communist Party member, and there are no difficulties that a Communist Party member cannot overcome!" She blurted out, and her spirits suddenly surged. She crawled back to the position. She was happily talking to the deputy squad leader about starting a frontline competition when there was a "boom" and a shell landed nearby. She had just crawled out of the dirt when she saw that half of the deputy squad leader's head had been blown off. She angrily shouted to everyone: "Comrades! The deputy squad leader sacrificed himself for everyone, for the liberation of us poor people! We must avenge him!" She bent down, held her rifle, and took advantage of the smoke from the shell explosion to rush up. The soldiers followed her and charged up the hillside. The enemy was muttering: "This barrage of fire must have wiped them all out." Guo Junqing secretly hardened her resolve: "'No one' left? Hmph! People are here." She used hand signals to order everyone to fix their bayonets and prepare hand grenades. At a command, ten or so hand grenades flew onto the hilltop. She led the soldiers to take advantage of the situation to charge up, and their squad that was in reserve also followed. The fifty or sixty enemies were so scared that they turned around and ran. But after the enemy reinforced with two more squads, a total of seventy or eighty people counterattacked Guo Junqing and her twenty or so men. The hilltop was repeatedly charged back and forth four times. Guo Junqing was already exhausted and her mouth was dry. At this time, two tall and burly enemies rushed fiercely towards her. How could Guo Junqing, alone, withstand them? Her first thought was: "I'll risk it and fight them, I can't let the enemy capture me alive!" She quickly untied the quick-release buckle on her backpack, dropped the twenty or so pounds of the backpack, raised her bayonet, and concentrated all her strength to fight. The bright bayonets in front of her flashed. With a "clang," the enemy's bayonet in front was blocked. She quickly turned around and used the butt of her rifle to push away the bayonet of the enemy behind her. The two enemies retreated a step almost simultaneously. "Good, so you're so useless!" Her courage suddenly rose, and she took another step forward with her bayonet, swinging her legs and fighting the enemies back and forth. "Fight well! Guo Junqing, revenge is at hand!" She secretly encouraged herself, fighting with more and more energy. Just as she was about to defeat one enemy with force and was about to relax and fight the other enemy, that one had already fled in panic. They victoriously occupied the hilltop.

　　At the merit evaluation meeting, Guo Junqing was awarded two merits. The squad she led was awarded the banner of "Combat Model Squad."

  (IV) A Strong Female Combat Hero

　　Guo Junqing has been tempered in the People's Liberation War and has become a female hero. Guo Junqing, the daughter of a poor peasant, has disguised herself as a man for five years, fighting from the Northeast all the way to the South, always standing at the forefront of the people's liberation struggle, using bayonets to dig fortifications to attack the enemy, and using bullets to shoot the enemies who drove her father to his death. It was not until April of this year that she revealed that she was a woman due to illness. At this time, she was already a nineteen-year-old deputy political instructor of a company.

　　Today, she was honorably elected as the army's special-class female combat hero and a representative to the National Combat Heroes Congress. This good daughter of the Chinese people, whose chest shines with the glory of the Mao Zedong Medal, recognized the hardships she had experienced and the honor she had obtained under the cultivation of the Party and the people. She resolved and said: "I will always be a combatant, standing at the forefront of defending the motherland. If the imperialists dare to invade us, I will definitely pick up my gun again and go to the front!" (Attached picture)

　　特等女战斗英雄郭俊卿
    王金凤
  （一）爹冻僵在雪堆里
    热河林东县大风雪的夜间，披着一床破棉絮的十三岁的郭俊卿和她娘颤抖地在山沟里转了半夜，寻找着一清早就上山给地主刨树疙瘩的爹。狂风夹带着鹅掌大的雪片，直打在她们脸上。棉絮湿透了，冰块一样地压在她背上。小俊卿一天没有吃，冻饿使她几乎失去了知觉。等到她听到她娘嚎叫着“她爹”，睁开眼来一看，她爹已经躺在雪堆里冻僵了，手里捏着刨树疙瘩的铁镐，身旁一块盖满了雪的树疙瘩。
    娘跪在地主孟德臣的面前，哭着求着借一点吃的，爹直挺挺躺在车上。孟德臣顶门站着，斜着眼望了一眼大车就破口大骂。小俊卿心疼着她爹，又心疼着她娘，往地上吐了口唾沫拉起她娘就走。
    爹躺在炕上五天不能动弹，孟德臣提着马鞭子见天逼着爹上工，逼着爹倒还工钱。小俊卿再也忍不住，拉开嗓子就骂。爹在炕上也应了几声，这样就骂出了祸殃。
    没膝深的雪地里，爹赤着脚被警察拖走了，连鞋也来不及穿。娘把家里锅盆碗勺都收罗起来变卖了。白花花的银洋，双手捧到孟德臣面前。半死的爹接回家不上三天就咽了气。小俊卿从此对地主们记下了这一笔不共戴天的大仇恨。
    补城墙，修苗圃，打小工，郭俊卿为了自己的娘，啥活都干。
    日子还是过不下去，郭俊卿和她娘跟小兄弟沿路乞讨到林西去。地主家在一旁冷笑着：“看她走的死路！”
  （二）报名去当八路军
    硬骨头的郭俊卿没有走死路，走出活路了。
    “八一五”东北解放，苏联红军开进热河林西城。郭俊卿在街上猛一眼看到红军中的女兵，她又惊讶又高兴。“女的也能当兵？！”她想着：“爹娘算没白养我，我还能当兵给我爹报仇！”
    披着件破皮袄，穿着条破棉裤，留着个“孩儿发”的十四岁的郭俊卿到八路军报名当兵去了。第一次人家见她小没收她，第二次换个地方，改名郭富，多报了两岁年纪，混说是个男的，就穿上黄棉军服当了兵。
    “这是条活路”，她吃饱了，穿暖了，喜孜孜地这样想：“活下去就能给爹报仇！”她带着这样单纯的阶级仇恨走进八路军。
    八路军的诉苦运动，把她的眼睛抹亮了一层。“天下穷人多得很，天下地主也多得很。要给爹报仇——要打倒地主阶级，打倒老蒋！”正当她这样捉摸着，她听到杀父仇人孟德臣被林东县群众斗倒的消息。她含着眼泪，大声和伙伴说：“这是共产党、八路军给我报的仇，是大伙穷兄弟给我报的仇，我坚决上前方打老蒋，给大伙穷兄弟们报仇！”
  （三）打老蒋，报血仇！
    在北方边地酷寒的天气里艰苦的行军和练兵，郭俊卿从没动摇过。她举着比自己身体还高的大盖枪练劈刺，跨着连马蹬也够不到的劣马练骑术；马上摔下来跌得头破血流，大盖枪扛得肩膀红肿，她咬着牙没有哼一声。她明白练好本领好去打老蒋报血仇。
    在大风雪的夜里，在火力封锁网下送着紧急的公文，十五岁的郭俊卿就成为一个出色的骑兵通讯员。当她将身体紧贴着马背急驰过敌人的密集火网，她一手紧握住胸前的文件，牢牢想着：“只要一中弹，立刻吞下它，死也不能让军事文件落到敌人手里去！”对阶级敌人的仇恨，使郭俊卿成了一个勇敢的战士。
    十七岁，她是一个战斗班长。她的一班练兵立了功，被派做突击班去夺取热河平泉城外一个大山头阵地。守御的敌人有五六十，拥有火箭炮、山炮、重机枪。她们一班只有十二条步枪。战士们和她都是第一次上阵。她知道任务的严重，和战士们一面挖着工事，一面心里发着愁。挖工事的动作不知不觉慢了下来。“班长你累了？让我来挖。”一个战士夺去了她手里的铁镐。她正待争辩，只见铁镐一闪，猛然想到她爹冻僵在雪堆里那只紧捏住铁镐的手，一阵愤怒和悲痛充塞了她的心胸。她拔出刺刀上在枪头，就使劲挖起工事来。
    冲锋号响了，郭俊卿端着刺刀，第一个冲在前面。三个战斗小组紧紧跟着她，一下冲到了第一道山梁。敌人的重武器开始发射，火箭炮、山炮、重机枪响成一片。飞机也出现在天空俯冲扫射。战士们有些心慌。郭俊卿一面命令大家分散隐蔽，一面鼓励着大家说：“今天是咱们打翻身仗的时候，打老蒋，算总帐，咱们争取火线立功。……”话还没落音，一阵迷糊，人软下来了。郭俊卿醒过来，知道自己月经来到了。她挣扎着爬到副班长身边嘱咐他，看待着阵地。自己弯着身体跑到一块大石头背后，身体就疼痛得再也直不起腰来。“郭俊卿，你今天要死在这里了”，她在心里呻吟着，“死在没有打仗的阵地上？”她追问了一句，心中不禁冒出火来。“我是一个共产党员，共产党员没有克服不了的困难！”她不觉念出声来，精神陡然旺盛，又爬回了阵地。她正高高兴兴和副班长说着要来个火线竞赛，“轰”的一声，一颗炮弹落在身旁。她刚从土里爬出来，就看到副班长的脑袋已经炸掉了一半。她愤怒地向大家喊着：“同志们！副班长是为了大伙，为了咱们穷人翻身，牺牲了！咱们要报仇！”她躬起身来，端着枪，趁着炮弹爆炸的浓烟冲上去。战士们跟着她，冲上了山腰。敌人正在叽咕着：“这一阵炮火可把他们消灭得没人了。”郭俊卿暗暗地发着狠：“‘没有人’了？哼！人可来了。”她用手势命令大家上好刺刀，准备好手榴弹。一声口令，十来颗手榴弹飞上了山头。她领着战士们趁势冲上去，接应他们的一班也跟了上来。五六十个敌人吓得回身就跑。但敌人在增援了两个班以后，一共七八十人又向着郭俊卿她们二十多个人反冲锋过来。山头上来回反复冲锋了四次。郭俊卿已经累得口枯舌干了。这时，两个身材高大的敌人凶恶地直向她冲来。郭俊卿自己一个人，怎能抵挡呢？她第一个念头就是：“豁出去和他们拼了，也不能让敌人抓活的！”她飞快地解开背包的活扣，卸掉了二十来斤重的背包，端起刺刀，集中起全身的力量拚，面前明晃晃的刺刀闪烁着。“铛”的一声，前面敌人的刺刀挡开了。她飞快地转过身来，就势用枪托拨开后面敌人的刺刀。两个敌人几乎同时后退了一步。“好，原来你们这般不中用！”她的勇气顿然上升，端着刺刀又逼上一步，抡开步子和敌人前后拚杀着。“打得好！郭俊卿，报仇在今朝！”她在心里暗暗鼓励着自己，愈打愈有劲。等到她用力把一个敌人打翻，正待放心来拚另一个敌人时，那一个已经狼狈逃跑了。他们就胜利地占领了山头。
    评功会上，郭俊卿被评了两功。她领导的班荣获了“战斗模范班”的锦旗。
  （四）一个坚强的女战斗英雄
    郭俊卿已经从人民解放战争中锻炼出来，成了女英雄。郭俊卿，一个贫农的女儿，五年来女扮男装，从东北一直打到江南，始终站在人民解放斗争的最前线，用刺刀来挖掘着攻打敌人的工事，用枪弹来射击着逼死她父亲的敌人。直到今年四月因病才说明了自己是女性。这时，她已经是一位十九岁的连队副政治指导员了。
    今天，她光荣当选为军的特等女战斗英雄和出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的代表。这位胸前闪耀着毛泽东奖章光辉的中华人民的好女儿，认识到自己经历的艰苦和在党与人民培育下获得的荣誉，她下决心说：“我要永远当个战斗队员，站在保卫祖国的最前线。如果帝国主义敢来侵略我们，我一定再拿起枪来上前线去！”（附图片）
