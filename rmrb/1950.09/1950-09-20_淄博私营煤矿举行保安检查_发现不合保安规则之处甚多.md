　　Zibo Private Coal Mines Conduct Safety Inspection
　　Many Violations of Safety Regulations Found
　　[Jinan News] According to the *Dazhong Daily*, with the assistance of the Boshan County People's Government, Zibo private coal mines in Shandong Province conducted a major safety inspection in July and August, discovering many serious problems that did not comply with safety regulations. Measures are now being taken to improve the situation.
　　On July 2nd, a water inrush accident occurred at the private Huadong Coal Mine. In order to learn from this lesson and prevent similar incidents, the Boshan County People's Government, after several discussions with the County Mining Association, decided to incorporate the experience of state-owned coal mines in strengthening safety work. A Safety Inspection Committee was established, with the Boshan County Mining Association as the main body, and engineers and technicians from state-owned coal mines were invited to help form an inspection team, which was divided into eight groups: drainage, ventilation, transportation, mining, mechanical and electrical, supports, civil engineering and construction, and hygiene. The inspection began on July 28th. It was found that the drainage capacity of each mine was very weak, and the amount of water increased in most mines during the rainy season. For example, the two 100-horsepower electric pumps at Zhenye Coal Mine had water tanks that were old and dilapidated, resulting in very low drainage efficiency. In addition, there was no sump, and a lot of water accumulated in the old pits, making it very easy for accidents to occur. The drainage equipment at Dacheng Coal Mine's Fengjia Well consisted of leather bags, draining 400 tons per day, while the highest water inrush during last year's rainy season reached 3,000 tons. If equipment is not added, the mining area may be flooded. In addition, the drainage capacity of Huadong Coal Mine and Dongfang Coal Mine cannot keep up with the water inrush. Failure to increase equipment will directly affect production.
　　Secondly, insufficient ventilation affects workers' health and poses a risk of spontaneous combustion. According to national regulations, the air volume should be three cubic meters per person per minute. However, the current air volume in each mine is generally around 0.5 cubic meters per person per minute. Due to poor ventilation, the temperature is generally between 27 and 30 degrees Celsius, except for Ruicheng Coal Mine, where the temperature does not exceed 25 degrees Celsius. The temperature in the Huazi Room of Dongfang Coal Mine is as high as 34.5 degrees Celsius. The reason for the low air volume is the chaotic ventilation system, serious air leakage, and insufficient mechanical ventilation equipment. In terms of transportation: all mine entrances use baskets to lift coal, and the steel cables used at the mine entrances have been knotted several times, making it very easy for accidents to occur. The wooden legs of the headframes at Zhenye and Hengtong mines are rotten and need to be completely replaced. The winch roads or rampways in each mine are not wide enough and lack safety equipment. Once a danger occurs, it cannot be stopped. In terms of roadway construction, most mines do not have sidewalks, and the few that do have them have not been repaired. For example, there are high-voltage lines in the sidewalk of Dacheng Coal Mine, which is very dangerous for pedestrians. The transportation roadway of Zhenye Coal Mine has not been repaired since the water was drained in August 1949, and coal is being extracted. Now, the top plate of the main roadway is cracked, and the sheds are rotten, posing a danger of roof collapse at any time.
　　More seriously, coal mining in each mine is still stuck in the backward residual pillar mining method. There is a high risk of roof collapse during backfilling, and the recovery rate is not high. In terms of mechanical and electrical equipment and explosives, some winches do not have foot brakes or safety valves, and the location of the boiler room is too close to the well, making it very easy for boiler explosions and other accidents to occur. All mines lack formal explosive storage facilities, which is extremely unsafe.
　　In total, the inspection revealed 807 safety violations of varying degrees, of which 661 need to be addressed urgently. Currently, the Safety Production Supervision Committee of the Boshan County Private Coal Mine Mining Association is discussing solutions based on the problems identified and specifying completion dates.

　　淄博私营煤矿举行保安检查
    发现不合保安规则之处甚多
    【济南讯】据大众日报消息：山东淄博私营煤矿在博山县人民政府帮助下，于七、八月间进行了保安大检查，发现许多不合乎保安规则的严重问题。现正设法改进。
    七月二日，私营华东煤矿发生透水事件，博山县人民政府为接受教训，防止类似事件发生，经与该县矿业公会数次研讨后，确定吸收国营煤矿加强保安工作的经验，成立保安检查委员会，并以博山县矿业公会为主，聘请国营煤矿工程、技术人员帮助，组成检查大队，下分排水、通风、运搬、采掘、机电、支柱、土木建筑、卫生等八组。七月二十八日开始检查。发现各矿排水能力十分薄弱，大部分矿井雨季水量增加，如振业煤矿的两台一百匹马力的电泵，水箱年久失修，排水效率甚小，加以没有水仓，老坑积水很多，极易发生事故。大成煤矿冯家井排水设备为牛皮包，每日排四百吨，而去年雨期涌水量最高则达三千吨，如不增添设备，该矿区将有被淹可能。此外如华东煤矿、东方煤矿的排水能力都赶不上涌水量，如不增加设备，将直接影响生产。
    其次，风量不足影响工人健康，且有发生自燃危险。按国家规定风量，每人每分钟三立方米。但目前各矿风量一般是每人每分钟○·五立方米左右。由于通风不良，温度除瑞成煤矿没过摄氏二十五度外，一般都在二十七至三十度，东方煤矿滑子房温度竟高达三十四·五度。风量低的原因是通风系统紊乱，漏风严重，以及机械通风设备不够。运搬方面：各矿井口全系用筐提煤，井口用的钢丝绳都打过几次结，极易发生事故。振业、恒通两矿井口大架木腿均已腐烂，需全部更换；各矿绞车道或轮子坡都不够宽，又无防险设备，一旦发生危险，便没法制止。巷道修建方面，各矿大部分没有人行道，个别矿虽有也未加修理。如大成煤矿人行道内有高压线，行人很危险。振业煤矿运搬巷道自一九四九年八月排出水后，未加修理即出炭，现大行顶盘崩裂，棚子腐烂，随时有冒顶危险。
    更严重的是各矿采煤仍停留于落后的残柱采掘法。回采时容易有冒顶危险，且回收率不高。机电火药方面，有的绞车没有粘脚或保险汽门，而且锅炉房的位置离井太近，极易发生锅炉爆炸及其他事故。各矿都无正式火药库，极不安全。
    总计检查结果，发现大小不合安全规则的有八百零七件，其中需急办的有六百六十一件。现博山县私营煤矿矿业公会所属安全生产督导委员会，正根据检查出的问题，研讨解决办法，并具体规定完成日期。
