　　Worldwide Students Fight for Peace
    ——An Interview with IUS Representative Eblers

    I.
    Eblers, an Executive Committee member of the International Student Union, is from Australia. He graduated from the Law and History departments of Australian universities in 1946 and 1948 respectively. In 1948, he served as the secretary of the Australian National Student Union, and in the following year, he joined the International Student Union. Now, he has come to China with the profound friendship and concern of students from all over the world. On the day of his arrival in Beijing, he met with reporters. The following is his conversation with the reporter.

    II.
    Since its establishment in 1946, the International Student Union has continuously called on students around the world to fight to defend world peace. This call has played a significant role. The issuance of the call varies depending on the country, generally being of a principle nature, but sometimes accompanied by detailed suggestions.

    To students in the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, they are called upon to study hard, produce hard, and build their own countries to defend peace.

    To students in colonial countries, such as Burma or Latin American countries, they are called upon: the student movement should be combined with the movement for national independence.

    Student movements in capitalist countries must be good at adopting struggle methods suitable to their own national conditions; at the same time, they should pay great attention to the economic struggle, because in countries such as the United States, Italy, and France, most of the financial expenditure is used for military purposes, and education funds are decreasing. Students are fighting at home to improve economic conditions, which is also fighting to defend peace. For example, military spending in the United States accounts for 70 percent of the total budget; this year's scholarships for American university students, including private scholarships, are only 5.5 percent of what they used to be. In Italy, police expenses account for 38 percent of the total budget, and the cost of raising horses alone is much higher than the cost of postgraduate studies. This year, France reduced social insurance subsidies for students by 50 percent.

    The International Student Union has published publications exposing how imperialist policies affect students' studies and economic situation.

    III.
    In preparation for the Second World Student Congress held in Prague, Czech Republic, on August 14 this year, the IUS Executive Committee held two meetings in London and Moscow respectively. Both meetings emphasized that the student movement should strengthen the struggle to defend world peace; one of the best ways to defend world peace at present is to widely carry out the peace signature campaign. Students all over the world responded enthusiastically to this call and greeted the conference with action. For example, 100 percent of university students in Moscow and Leningrad signed their names, more than 97 percent of university students in Romania signed their names, and 85 to 90 percent of students in French colonies signed their names.

    Based on the report of the Executive Committee, the conference summarized the past work and decided on the current tasks. It pointed out that the main issue is that all struggles must be combined with the peace movement; it is necessary to stop the threat of aggressive war. The resolution also called on students from all countries to support the resolution of the World Peace Council Executive Bureau and send representatives to the Second World Peace Congress to be held in November. The resolution also mentioned concerns about students' economic situation and health, and decided to establish international student sanatoriums in the Czech Republic and China, the latter specifically for Asian colonial countries' students to recuperate from lung diseases; and to restore the International Student Relief Organization, which had once ceased to exist.

    The conference also sent a telegram condemning the American imperialists' interference in Korea, Vietnam, Malaya, and China's territory of Taiwan.

    The conference fully demonstrated and strengthened the solidarity of international students. Eight hundred and sixty-four representatives from seventy-one countries, representing five million students, participated in the conference. After British student representative Jenkins made anti-Soviet remarks and violated the resolution of the International Student Union, eight hundred and thirty representatives expressed their unanimous support for the conference report and resolution and further made many suggestions for strengthening future work. This shows that students all over the world are peace-loving and united, and no provocation or conspiracy can change this desire and unity in the slightest.

    IV.
    Eblers visited medical schools, industrial schools, and primary schools in the Northeast, and met with some student leaders and responsible persons of education work. These visits and contacts gave him a good impression. He believes that Chinese students have a high enthusiasm for learning, and students and teachers cooperate very well.

    He also praised that Chinese students' understanding of the view of serving the people is so clear. He said: "This is very different compared to Australian students. When you ask an Australian medical student why they are studying medicine? He will definitely tell you that being a doctor is for making money. But in China, I have never encountered this answer."

    Eblers was particularly moved by the internationalist spirit of Chinese students. As he said: This internationalist spirit is not only manifested in the warm welcome of the delegation, but also in the fact that Chinese students care about the student movements in other countries and have helped students from other countries participate in the World Student Congress; more importantly, Chinese students are working hard and preparing for the construction of New China, which is a powerful contribution to world peace.

### 全世界学生为和平而斗争——访国际学联代表艾贝尔斯

　　全世界学生为和平而斗争
    ——访国际学联代表艾贝尔斯
    一
    国际学生联合会执委艾贝尔斯是澳大利亚人。他在一九四六年与四八年两度毕业于澳大利亚大学的法律系与历史系，一九四八年任澳大利亚全国学生联合会的书记，第二年就到国际学联工作了。现在他带着全世界学生的深厚友谊和关怀来到中国。抵达北京的当天，他便接见了记者。下面是他和记者的谈话。
    二
    国际学联自一九四六年成立以来曾不断地号召全世界的学生为保卫世界和平而斗争。这号召曾起了很大的作用。号召的发出视不同的国家而有所区别，一般只是原则性的，但有时也附有详细的建议。
    对于苏联及各人民民主国家的学生们，号召他们，努力学习，努力生产，建设自己的国家来保卫和平。
    对于各殖民地国家，如缅甸或拉丁美洲等国的学生，号召他们：学生运动要与争取民族独立运动相结合。
    在资本主义国家的学生运动要善于采取适合于本国情况的斗争方式；同时并应对经济方面的斗争予以极大的注意，因为美、意、法等国家的财政支出大半用于军事，教育经费愈来愈少；学生们在国内为争取经济条件改善而斗争，也就是为保卫和平而斗争了。如美国的军费占总预算的百分之七十；美国今年大学生的奖学金，包括私人奖学金在内只有过去的百分之五·五。意大利的警察费占总预算的百分之三十八，仅养马的费用就比研究生的费用多得多。法国今年把学生的社会保险津贴减少了百分之五十。
    国际学联曾出版刊物揭发帝国主义的政策如何影响学生的学习与经济情况。
    三
    为了准备今年八月十四日在捷京布拉格举行的第二次世界学生代表大会，国际学联执委会曾先后在伦敦、莫斯科举行了两次会议。两次会议中都强调指出学生运动要加强为保卫世界和平而斗争；保卫世界和平在目前最好的办法之一是广泛的开展和平签名运动。全世界学生热烈地响应了这一号召，并以行动来迎接大会。如莫斯科、列宁格勒的大学生百分之百的签了名，罗马尼亚的大学生百分之九十七以上签了名，法国殖民地的学生百分之八十五到百分之九十签了名。
    大会根据执委会的报告，总结了过去的工作并决定了当前的任务。指出：主要的问题是一切斗争要与和平运动相结合；要制止侵略战争的威胁。决议并号召各国学生支持和大执行局的决议，派代表出席十一月举行的第二次和大会议。决议中也曾关心地提及学生经济情况和健康问题，决定在捷克和中国成立国际学生疗养院，后者专为亚洲殖民地国家学生疗养肺病之用；并恢复曾一度不存在的国际学生救济组织。
    大会并曾通电谴责美帝对朝鲜、越南、马来亚等国以及中国领土台湾的干涉。
    大会充分显示与加强了国际学生的团结，七十一个国家的八百六十四位代表，代表着五百万学生参加了大会。在英国学生代表詹金斯发表反苏言论与破坏国际学联的决议后，八百三十位代表表示了要一致的拥护大会报告与决议并进一步地对加强今后的工作提出很多建议。这说明着全世界学生是酷爱和平、团结一致的，任何的挑拨和阴谋并不能使这种意愿和团结有丝毫改变。
    四
    艾贝尔斯在东北曾参观了医学院、工业学校、和小学等，并会晤了一些学生领袖及教育工作的负责者。这些参观和接触使他得到一个良好印象，他认为中国学生学习的情绪很高，学生与教员间合作得非常好。
    他并赞扬中国学生们对于为人民服务的观点是认识得如此明确。他说：“这和澳大利亚的学生比起来有很大的差别。当你问一个澳大利亚的医学生为什么学医？他一定会告诉你做医生是为着赚钱。而在中国就从未遇到此种回答。”
    艾贝尔斯对中国学生的国际主义精神尤为感动。正如他所说：这种国际主义精神不仅表现在热烈的欢迎代表团这件事情上，还表现在中国学生们关心其他各国的学生运动并曾帮助其他国家的学生参加世界学代会；更重要的是，中国学生的正在为新中国的建设事业而努力学习着、准备着，这就是对世界和平的有力贡献。（附图片）
