　　The Commanders and Fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    Enthusiastically Launch a Peace Signature Campaign
　 --Comprehensive Report from This Publication
　 The millions of commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have enthusiastically launched a peace signature campaign. From the lush green fields to the grasslands of the frontier, from the bandit suppression battlefields in the towering mountains to the railway and highway construction sites and the river embankments under urgent repair, a surge of peace signatures by commanders and fighters swept through. The hands of the commanders and fighters, accustomed to holding guns and cannons, powerfully wrote their names on the peace declaration. These thousands of names represent the determination and strength of the great Chinese People's Liberation Army in the struggle to defend world peace.
　 When the various units heard that American imperialism had launched aggression against Korea and Taiwan, they were filled with indignation. They had personally annihilated more than eight million Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, mostly trained and equipped by American imperialism, and they were extremely indignant towards American imperialism. Many units held solemn oaths to defend peace while carrying out the peace signature campaign. They wrote down their pledges. The commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army wrote in their pledge: "Although we hold weapons in our hands, we deeply love peace. At the same time, we are not afraid of war. If the warmongers of imperialism dare to invade our motherland, then we will resolutely wipe them out!"
　 At the same time, all units combined the peace signature campaign with in-depth education in patriotism, revolutionary heroism, and internationalism. The commanders and fighters more deeply recognized the strength of the peace camp and the growing prestige of the world people's movement to defend peace, thus strengthening their confidence in defending peace and defeating the aggressors.
　 The commanders and fighters all attached great importance to this great movement. In the Central South Military Region, a very large number of units had more than 80 percent of their personnel sign. In the Northwest Military Region, more than 55 percent of the entire army signed, and 100 percent of a certain corps stationed in Shaanxi signed. In the East China Military Region and the North China Military Region, the number of signatures exceeded 65 percent of the entire army. The signature campaign of the commanders and fighters of the Northeast Military Region is also unfolding enthusiastically. A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army was on its way to the Wanshan Islands when they received news of the signature campaign. The soldiers rushed to sign on the decks of the warships. Twelve soldiers of a certain company, who were guarding a railway bridge eight miles away from their station, immediately took turns returning to the company to sign after hearing the news. The troops stationed in the countryside of the East China Military Region actively assisted the local government in holding village meetings, carrying out propaganda work, and mobilizing the peasants to sign. The troops of the Zhejiang Military Region engaged in bandit suppression in the mountainous areas, publicizing the peace signature campaign while suppressing bandits, and mobilizing many people to sign. The troops stationed on the Xikang Plateau engaged in bandit suppression and large-scale construction projects enthusiastically participated in the signature campaign. The bandit suppression troops of the Guizhou Military Region also carried out the signature campaign in the Miao ethnic areas in the deep mountains. Comrade Liu Zhengming of the North China Military Region, who had participated in the revolution for twenty-two years and lost his right hand in the war, heard the news of the signature campaign while recuperating in a sanatorium. He signed his name with his left hand and wrote: "If the warmongers dare to launch a war, I still have my left hand to fight them!" Comrade Chen Chu, who lost his sight in the war, also groped and signed his name. Many seriously wounded and sick soldiers propped themselves up in bed and solemnly wrote their names on the peace declaration. Some soldiers who could not write asked people to teach them how to write their names overnight, and the next day they excitedly signed the declaration.

　　中国人民解放军的指战员们
    热烈展开和平签名运动
　 ——本刊综合报道
　 中国人民解放军的数百万指战员们，热火朝天地展开了和平签名运动。从葱绿的田野，到边疆的草原；从崇山峻岭中的剿匪战场，到正在修建中的铁路、公路施工地和抢修中的河堤上，都卷起了指战员们保卫世界和平签名的狂潮。指战员们拿惯了枪、摸惯了炮的手，有力地在和平宣言上写下了自己的名字。这千万个名字代表了伟大的中国人民解放军在保卫世界和平斗争中的决心和力量。
　 各个部队听到了美帝国主义对朝鲜、台湾发动了侵略，他们愤慨得不得了。他们曾经亲手歼灭了大部为美帝国主义训练、装备的八百多万蒋匪军，他们对美帝国主义是万分愤慨的。很多部队在开展和平签名运动时，举行了庄严的保卫和平的宣誓。他们写下了决心书。西北军区暨第一野战军某部的指战员在决心书上写着：“虽然我们手握着武器，但是我们万分地热爱和平。同时，我们决不怕战争。如果帝国主义好战分子胆敢侵略我们的祖国，那我们就要坚决地消灭它！”
　 各部同时结合和平签名运动，深入地进行了爱国主义、革命的英雄主义和国际主义的教育。指战员们更深切地认识到和平阵营力量的坚强，世界人民保卫和平运动声威的壮大，因此更加强了他们保卫和平，打垮侵略者的信心。
　 指战员们都万分重视这一个伟大的运动。中南军区有极多的单位有百分之八十以上签了名。西北军区全军有百分之五十五以上签了名，驻陕西某兵团百分之百的人都签了名。华东军区、华北军区签名人数都超过了全军的百分之六十五。东北军区的指战员们的签名运动更是在热烈地展开。第四野战军某部在向万山群岛进军途中，他们得到了签名的消息，战士们便在舰艇的甲板上抢着签名；某连的十二名战士在驻地八里外警卫铁桥，听到签名的消息后，他们马上轮流赶回连上去签名。华东军区驻农村的部队积极协助地方政府召开村民大会，展开宣传工作，动员农民签名。浙江军区在山区剿匪的部队，一面剿匪一面宣传和平签名，动员了很多群众签了名。远在西康高原上剿匪和从事巨大规模建设工程的部队，踊跃地参加签名运动；贵州军区剿匪部队并将签名运动开展到了深山中的苗胞区。华北军区的一位参加革命二十二年、在战争中失去了右手的刘正明同志，在疗养院休养中听到了签名消息，他用左手签上自己的名字，并写着：“如果战争贩子们敢于发动战争，我还有左手可以与他们斗争！”另一位在战争中双目失明的陈础同志，也摸索着签了名。很多重伤病员在病床上支起身体，郑重地在和平宣言上写上自己的名字。一些不会写字的战士们连夜请人教会写自己的名字，第二天就兴奋地在宣言上签了名。
