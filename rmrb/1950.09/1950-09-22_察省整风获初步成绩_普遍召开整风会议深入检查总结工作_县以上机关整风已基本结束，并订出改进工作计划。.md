　　Initial Successes in Rectification in Chahar Province

　　Rectification Meetings Widely Held for In-Depth Review and Summary of Work

　　Rectification in Organs Above County Level Basically Completed, Improvement Plans Formulated

[Report from this newspaper] The rectification movement for cadres in organs above the county level throughout Chahar Province, which began in mid-July, has now basically concluded its review and summary phase. Plans for improving work are currently being formulated. This will greatly advance the implementation of policies in the future.

In June, the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session and the directives from the Central Committee and the North China Bureau, issued rectification instructions to Party committees at all levels and conducted rectification mobilization. In early July, the spirit of rectification was implemented at the Chahar Provincial People's Representative Conference, and work was reviewed. In mid-July, the Provincial Committee convened a rectification meeting for main cadres above the county level. By the end of August, cities and counties had held rectification meetings. These meetings lasted from seven to ten days, focusing on conveying and discussing Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session, using it as the basis for reviewing work, policies, ideology, and work style. These meetings emphasized the implementation of four policies: adjusting industry and commerce, correcting the direction of rural production, the united front, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. Through these meetings, the policy and ideological level of cadres was raised, the attitude toward rectification was corrected, rectification backbones were trained, and rectification experience was gained. After the meetings, each district or county began to arrange the "Three Autumns" work (autumn harvesting, plowing, and sowing) and initially implemented the spirit of rectification. Now, due to the start of the autumn harvest, district-level cadres have gone to the countryside, so they are using the method of self-study of documents to prepare for rectification during agricultural slack time.

This rectification involved checking policies and work style through rectification meetings. Methods such as top-down, Party members first then non-Party members, gentle breeze and fine rain, and steady progress were adopted, avoiding major deviations. However, in some counties, the concentration of most cadres in meetings had some impact on work at lower levels. In some counties, the scale of the meetings was too small and the implementation was insufficient (such as the rectification meeting in Chongli County, which only had fifty people). Some counties lacked focus, the scope of the review was too broad, and the solutions for improving work were not specific enough, resulting in a very poor depth of resolution. Some counties only reviewed the leadership without reviewing themselves, and did not properly grasp criticism and self-criticism. Once discovered, attention was paid to remedying and correcting these issues.

Leadership Busy with Meetings, Instructions Often Based on Subjective Thinking

The review revealed that cadres at all levels were generally active, responsible, and hardworking, and completed various tasks, with achievements being the main aspect. However, it was also found that cadres at all levels had varying degrees of bureaucracy and commandism. Among responsible cadres at the provincial, municipal, prefectural, and county levels, a more common problem was insufficient understanding of the situation, inability to handle matters according to specific circumstances, and solving problems mostly based on "generalities" or "close enough." Everyone was busy with daily affairs, busy with meetings and writing instructions. The Provincial Finance Department alone issued 683 instructions from January to July, with each document requiring as many as sixteen handling procedures, trapping the leadership in bureaucratic red tape. There was more arrangement than inspection in work, and less specific assistance to lower levels. There was an urgent demand to complete tasks. In key tasks such as seed soaking, autumn plowing, and disaster relief, many deviations occurred and even some serious problems arose due to a lack of understanding of the situation. For example, the Provincial Civil Affairs Department only saw a few typical materials of improved disaster conditions and estimated that the disaster situation in the entire region had improved, leading to leadership passivity and starvation deaths in disaster areas.

A more common problem among cadres below the district level was a lack of research on policies. When encountering difficulties in implementation, they resorted to coercion and command, pitting responsibility to the people against responsibility to superiors, often resulting in great losses to work and affecting the prestige of the Party and the government. Secondly, some cadres still held the one-sided view of poor peasants and hired laborers, believing that "poverty is glorious" and "poverty is justified," thus neglecting to unite the entire people and implement the production policies of organizing, developing production, and making the lives of all peasants prosperous.

In addition, the review also revealed that some cadres had degenerative thoughts and "retirement" thoughts, as well as serious corruption and waste.

Jointly Formulating Plans to Improve Work, Cadres Energetic and Confidence Increased

After more than a month of preliminary rectification, cadres at all levels realized the harm of bureaucracy and commandism to work and resolved to correct them, jointly formulating plans to improve work. As a result, everyone was energetic and happy. In agricultural production, it was decided to start by correcting forced lending and forced mutual aid to rectify the direction of agricultural production. On the issue of urban and rural areas, the economic relationship between urban and rural areas was adjusted. In terms of uniting the broad masses of the people and non-Party members, it was decided to strengthen the work of People's Representative Conferences at all levels. Regarding the relationship between Party and non-Party cadres, many organs and factories have already seen significant improvements. Even the commandism and rigid work style at lower levels has begun to change. The red tape and complicated procedures of the Provincial Government are being improved, and work efficiency has begun to increase.

Based on the above situation, Chahar Province has determined that in the further in-depth rectification in the future, it is necessary to focus on individuals and clarify responsibilities. The problems identified should be dealt with specifically, and cadres who have achieved success in their work should be commended. It must also be emphasized that the achievements of rectification should be tested in work to strengthen the enthusiasm of cadres. Meetings should be held periodically for review, summary, and awards, so that the rectification movement can be further deepened and improved.

The most important of the four basic experiences is to inspect key work in a planned and prepared manner, and formulate a plan for improvement.

During this period of rectification, the following basic experiences were gained:

(1) Start with checking the work. The most important thing in checking the work is to base it on Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session. In addition, according to the nature of the department, some reference documents can be determined, such as trade unions and enterprise departments can study the Trade Union Law, and the People's Daily's "February 7th" editorial. In the review, it is necessary to grasp the main problems of the department and not involve too wide a range. "Rectify whatever exists" means starting from reality, different departments have different centers, not a horizontal listing of many problems without a center. Otherwise, it is easy to deviate from the general direction and requirements of rectification and get entangled in life details. After the inspection, focus on thinking of ways and making plans (including individual department or regional plans). Emphasizing this point can prevent empty talk.

(2) Leading cadres should set an example when checking the work. At the beginning, leading cadres should make an enlightening self-criticism on the main problems existing in their departments, actively participate in guidance during the inspection process, and finally draw a clear conclusion. This can grasp the key points, take fewer detours, clarify thinking, and improve everyone. Experience has proven that this method is successful. On the contrary, if leading cadres adopt an attitude of "avoidance" or "watching from the sidelines," standing in the position of being inspected, letting subordinates criticize and speak first, and not expressing their own attitude, it is bound to fail.

(3) To absorb non-Party cadres to participate in rectification, first, rely on the exemplary influence of Party members. This time, because Party members were rectified first and then non-Party members, and because the self-criticism of Party members was generally profound, many non-Party masses were very moved. They said: "We lack training, and we should be stricter with us." Second, in organs with a large number of non-Party cadres, a rectification committee was organized (on the basis of the original administrative leadership) to absorb non-Party cadres to participate in the leadership. The active activities of these people have played a great role in the rectification of non-Party cadres. Third, hold more forums for non-Party cadres hosted by leading cadres. This is of great help to the rectification of both Party and non-Party cadres.

(4) Welcome the enthusiastic help of the broad masses of the working people in rectification. When many counties in Chahar South held rectification meetings, they absorbed rural working cadres and people with good standing to participate, and put forward many vivid and valuable opinions on policy implementation and cadres' work style. It has great educational significance for cadres. Now many county and district cadres are preparing to report the problems and improvement suggestions checked out by the county and district leaders to the county and district people's congresses for comments. This is of great help to inspection and summary.

　　察省整风获初步成绩
    普遍召开整风会议深入检查总结工作
    县以上机关整风已基本结束，并订出改进工作计划。
    【本报讯】察哈尔全省县以上机关干部的整风运动，自七月中旬开始到现在，检查与总结工作基本上已告结束。现在正在拟定改进工作的计划。这对今后政策的贯彻将大大向前推进一步。
    六月间，中共察哈尔省委即依据毛主席三中全会报告和中央及华北局指示，对各级党委发出整风指示；并进行了整风动员。七月初，省各界人民代表会议上贯彻了整风精神，检查了工作。七月中，省委召开了县级以上主要干部的整风会议。至八月底，市、县都召开了整风会议。会议的时间七天到十天，均以传达讨论毛主席三中全会报告为中心；并以此作为检查工作、政策思想和作风的依据。在这些会议上，着重贯彻了调整工商业、端正农村生产方向、统一战线、镇压反革命等四项政策。经过这些会议，提高了干部政策思想水平，端正了整风态度，训练了整风骨干，吸取了整风经验。会后各区或县在布置三秋工作并初步贯彻了整风精神。现因进入秋收，区级干部下乡，所以采用自修文件的方法，准备抽农隙时间整。
    这次整风，是通过整风会议方式，检查政策、检查作风。并采用自上而下，先党内后党外，和风细雨，稳步前进等办法，未出多大偏向。但是有的县也因干部大部集中开会，下边工作曾受到一些影响。有的县会议规模过小，贯彻不足（如崇礼县整风会议只有五十人）。有的县缺乏重点，检查面过广，对改进工作办法不够具体，解决的深度很差。有的县单纯检查领导不检查自己，对批评与自我批评掌握不好。经发现后，已注意弥补和纠正。
  领导忙于开会指示办事多从主观出发
    从检查中可以看到：各级干部，一般积极负责，辛勤工作，完成了各项任务，成绩是主要的。但同时发现各级干部存在有程度不同的官僚主义、命令主义作风。在省、市、专、县的负责干部中，较为普遍的问题是：了解情况不够，不能按具体情况办事，解决问题多从“大体上”或“差不多”出发。大家忙于日常事务，忙于开会写指示。只省府财政厅一月至七月即发出指示六百八十三件，每个文件处理手续达十六道之多，使领导陷于文牍主义圈内。工作上布置多，检查少，对下边的具体帮助差，要求完成任务急。在浸拌种、秋耕地、救灾等中心工作上，因为不了解情况，出了不少偏向，甚至发生不少严重的问题，如：省府民政厅只见到灾情好转的几个典型材料，便估计全区灾情好转，致使领导被动，灾区有饿死人的现象发生。
    区以下的干部，较为普遍的问题是：对政策不研究，执行中遇到困难时，便强迫命令，把对人民负责和对上级负责对立起来，因此给工作常常带来很大损失，影响了党和政府的威信。其次，有些干部还存在着“穷光荣”、“穷有理”的片面的贫雇观点，因而忽视了团结全体人民，贯彻组织起来，发展生产，使全体农民生活走向富裕的生产政策。
    此外，还检查出一部分干部有蜕化思想和“退休”思想，和严重的贪污浪费现象。
  共同拟定改进工作计划，干部精神饱满，信心增加。
    各地经过一个多月的初步整风后，由于干部从思想上认识到官僚主义、命令主义对工作的危害，决心改正，共同定出了改进工作的计划。因此大家精神饱满、心情愉快。在农业生产上，决定从纠正强迫借贷和强迫互助下手，端正农业生产方向；在城乡问题上，调整城乡经济关系；在团结广大人民与党外人士方面，决定加强各界人民代表会的工作。关于党与非党干部的关系，不少机关、工厂已有显著改进。就是下边的强迫命令、生硬作风，也开始有了转变。省政府的文牍主义和繁杂手续正在着手改进，工作效率开始提高。
    根据上面情况，察哈尔省确定，在今后深入一步的整风中，需要有重点地联系个人，查明责任。对检查出来的问题要进行具体处理，对一些工作有成绩的干部要予以表扬。并须强调整风成绩要在工作中去加以考验，以加强干部工作的积极性。在一定时期，要开会进行检查、总结与评奖，使整风运动再深入与提高一步。
  四条基本经验中最主要的是有计划地有准备地检查主要工作，并定出改进工作计划。
    在这一段整风运动中，取得了以下几条基本经验：
    （一）一开始就要从检查工作入手。检查工作中最主要的是依据毛主席三中全会报告。此外还可以根据部门性质，确定一些参考文件，例如工会和企业部门可以学习工会法、人民日报的“二七”社论等。检查中必须抓住本部门的主要问题，不能涉及过广。“有啥整啥”是指从实际出发，不同部门有不同中心，并不是没有中心地平列许多问题。不然，很容易脱离整风总的方向和要求，纠缠到生活细节上去。检查后着重想办法、定计划（包括个人部门或地区计划），强调这点可以防止说空话。
    （二）检查工作时，领导干部应以身作则。一开始领导干部就应就本部门存在的主要问题作一启发性的检讨发言，并于检查过程中积极参加指导，最后作出明确结论。这样就可以抓住要害，少走弯路，明确思想，提高大家。经验证明：这一方法是成功的。相反的，如果领导干部采取“回避”、“旁观”的态度，站到被检查的地位，先让下级批评发言，自己不表明态度等一套方法，是必然失败的。
    （三）吸收非党干部参加整风，一、要依靠党员模范影响。这次由于先整党内后整党外，并且由于党员一般检讨的深刻，许多非党群众很受感动，他们说：“我们缺乏锻炼，对我们应严格些。”二、非党干部较多的机关，曾组织了整风委员会（在原行政领导的基础上），吸取非党干部参加领导。这些人的积极活动对非党干部的整风作用很大。三、要多开些由领导干部主持的非党干部座谈会。这样对党员干部与非党干部整风，帮助很大。
    （四）欢迎广大劳动人民的热情的帮助整风。察南许多县召开整风会议时，吸收了农村劳动正派的村干部、群众参加，对执行政策和干部作风，提出了许多很生动很宝贵的意见。对干部教育意义很大。现在许多县区准备把县区领导检查出的问题和改进的意见，拿到县区人民代表会上去报告征求意见。这样作对检查总结帮助很大。
