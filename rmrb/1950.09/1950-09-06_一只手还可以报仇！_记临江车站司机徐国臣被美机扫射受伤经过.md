　　"One hand can still take revenge!"
    ——An account of the injury of Linjiang Station driver Xu Guochen after being strafed by American aircraft

    At around 11:00 AM on August 27th, Xu Guochen, a driver from the Linjiang Station locomotive section, and several other workers were busily loading coal onto a locomotive on the coal platform. This locomotive was scheduled to pull a long line of freight cars to Tonghua at 12:00 noon. Beside it, there were two other locomotives parked. Suddenly, a worker shouted, "Airplane!" Xu Guochen looked in the direction the worker was pointing and saw a plane diving down directly above them. When he identified it as an "American airplane!" he quickly jumped off the coal platform. At that moment, the American plane opened fire with its machine guns, and another American plane flew in. He thought, "With so many locomotives together, they should be dispersed." So, he braved the gunfire and climbed onto locomotive number 928, intending to drive it to a nearby cave. At this time, the sound of machine guns was deafening, and countless machine gun bullets, trailing streaks of crimson flame, flew and landed with a "whoosh" all around him, above and below. He bravely and resolutely started the locomotive. Just as he had driven the locomotive about twenty meters, he discovered that the track switch ahead had not been moved over, so he had to stop the locomotive and crawled under it, resting his chin on the back of his left hand to take cover.
    Suddenly, his face was completely buried in dirt. Xu Guochen brushed away the dirt and saw that all four fingers of his left hand, except for the thumb, were shattered to pieces, with blood flowing non-stop. The locomotive cylinder, hit by the American aircraft, was hissing with steam, and the American plane was still continuing its mad strafing. He was so indignant that he forgot his own pain, held his left wrist tightly with his right hand to stop the bleeding, and calmly ran towards the operations room.
    After the American plane strafed for more than ten minutes and flew away, the workers quickly extinguished the fire on the locomotive and sent Xu Guochen to the Linjiang County Hospital. The doctor performed emergency surgery on him. From then on, his left hand was left with only a thumb. That evening, he was escorted to the Tonghua City Railway Workers' Hospital for treatment.
    In the hospital, Xu Guochen said to those who came to express their sympathy, "The American plane has crippled my left hand, but I can still use my right hand to work harder and take revenge." Various government agencies, factories, and schools sent letters to express their sympathy to this driver who had been harmed by the American beasts. Many letters stated: "We must learn from your spirit of self-sacrifice, work hard, and prepare to smash the conspiracy of American imperialism to expand its aggression."

　　“一只手还可以报仇！”
    ——记临江车站司机徐国臣被美机扫射受伤经过
    周群
    八月二十七日上午十一时左右，临江车站机务段司机徐国臣和其他几个工友正在煤台上紧张地给一台机车上煤。这台机车在正午十二时就要牵引一长列货车开往通化去。在它的旁边还有两台机车停放着。忽然一个工友叫起来：“飞机！”徐国臣顺着这个工友所指的方向看去，一架飞机恰在他们的上空向下俯冲。当他辨识那是“美国飞机！”的时候，便火速地跳下煤台。而这时美机的机枪就扫射了，接着又飞来一架美国飞机。他想“这样多的机车在一起，应该疏散开才对。”于是他就冒着弹雨爬上了九二八号机车，想把它开往附近的山洞去。这时，机枪声响成一片，无数机枪子弹曳着一条赤红色的火焰，在他前后左右、头上脚下，嗖嗖地飞落着。他勇敢而坚定地开动了机车正当他把机车开出二十公尺时，他发现前面的道岔未搬过来，他只得停了车，并爬到机车下面，下颚垫在左手背上躲伏着。
    突然，他的脸部全被土埋起来。徐国臣摆开土块，看见左手除了姆指以外，其余四个手指全被打的零零烂烂，鲜血在不停地流着。被美机击伤的机车汽缸在哧哧地冒着汽，美机还在继续疯狂的扫射。他愤慨得忘记了自己的痛苦，用右手紧握住左手腕，不让它流血，沉着地跑向运转室去。
    美机扫射十余分钟逸去后，工人们一方面迅速地把着火的机车救熄，一方面把徐国臣送到临江县立医院。医生给他施行了紧急手术。从此他的左手便只剩下一个大姆指了。当晚，他又被护送到通化市铁路职工医院去治疗。
    徐国臣在医院里对向他慰问的人说：“美机打残废了我的左手，我还可以用右手来加倍工作和报仇。”各机关工厂学校纷纷写信慰问这位遭到美国野兽残害的司机。许多信都写着：“我们一定要学习你的自我牺牲的精神，紧张地工作，准备粉碎美帝国主义扩大侵略的阴谋。”
