　　The 73-Year-Old Hero – Jiang Weiping
　　Qin Jiang
　　Comrade Jiang Weiping is a model worker in the army, currently serving as the Deputy Section Chief of the Business Section of the Chahar Military Region Production Cooperative General Branch. He joined the army at the age of sixty and soon after joined the Chinese Communist Party. He participated in medical, farm, and other work in the army, establishing many achievements. When he was working on the farm, Comrade Xie Juezai once sent him a seven-character poem:
　　"Soldier, farmer, etiquette, and music, proficient in all,
　　Hands, feet, mind, and spirit, excelling in everything,
　　Having traversed the nine continents, returning to establish a garden,
　　An old monkey in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit."
　　This time, he was selected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Laborers, Model Workers, and Soldiers. Before attending, he prepared a challenge to the national model workers, requesting to forever be loyal to serving the people and to promote the role of role models. He resolutely opposes American imperialist aggression and is determined to defend world peace.
　　The 73-year-old hero, Jiang Weiping, was originally a labor hero and model worker in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. He is from Fangshan County, Hebei Province, and came from a poor family. He worked as an apprentice, a hired hand, and also worked in coal mines and the old army. In 1919, he was dismissed from the warlord's army and returned to his hometown, where he began studying Western medicine, opened a rural hospital and a Western pharmacy, and treated poor people. After so many years of running around and honing his skills, he gradually discovered a path - to follow the Communist Party. In February of his sixtieth year (1938), when a unit of the 359th Brigade of the Eighth Route Army advanced into Pingxi, he brought all his medicines to join the revolution, serving as a doctor in the army to treat the wounded and sick. Two months later, he joined the Chinese Communist Party. He himself said: "After joining the Party, my life has finally found its belonging. I am determined to dedicate my life to the Party and the people, and I have no other personal desires." Since then, he accepted the Party's education, further transformed his thinking, and wholeheartedly worked for the Party and served the people.
　　Half a year later, the Western medicine he brought was used up. He read Chairman Mao's "On Protracted War" and became worried. "Protracted war, yes! We must carry out a protracted war of resistance." "But what about medicine?" He thought over and over and found a solution - use traditional Chinese medicine. So he followed the army to each place and asked the village cadres which family had secret recipes. After finding out, he personally visited the villagers, using the principles of protracted war and national resistance to persuade them, and recorded those secret recipes. There were recipes for treating malaria, for treating typhoid fever... he visited and found more than 300 secret recipes. The most useful were more than 40. Then, he went to each place, found villagers who knew herbs, accompanied them personally, climbed high mountains and ridges, and asked the villagers to find the herbs, explain the names, effects, and harvest periods. At the same time, he found Chinese medicine shops and rural Chinese medicine practitioners, asked about medicine manufacturing and usage methods, and borrowed some medicine manufacturing books. After several studies, he achieved initial success. So, he led the young nurses to the mountains to collect herbs, and when they returned, they found some earthenware pots, iron pots, even teapots, set up a fire, and while the young nurses were decocting medicine, he diagnosed and treated the soldiers. His Western medicine was self-taught, and he was even more of an amateur when it came to traditional Chinese medicine. But he was not afraid of the hard work of collecting and making medicine, painstakingly researched, questioned and examined more during diagnosis, and used medicine boldly but carefully, finally overcoming the difficulty of medicine and curing the soldiers' illnesses. In such arduous guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, for three or four years, his troops did not experience medicine shortages, and he also helped the villagers treat many illnesses.
　　In the spring of 1941, the 359th Brigade arrived in Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, and the entire brigade was concentrated for defense. There were quite a few sick people, but there was no medicine at all. At this time, Old Jiang volunteered to make medicine for the brigade's health department. The old man led more than forty young people to sweep the snowy white alkali (mirabilite) on the banks of the Wuding River. He took these raw materials, decocted, precipitated, and experimented with formulating them. At that time, he was also sick, but he still continued to experiment painstakingly. After four or five failures, he finally made sodium sulfate, which was urgently needed by the troops at that time, within more than twenty days. It had the same effect as imported products and did not have any precipitation. After making a large batch of sodium sulfate, he then collected and researched in many ways, using local Shaanxi products, animal, plant, and mineral raw materials, and successively formulated "Scabies Be Gone," "Bright Eyes Medicine Powder," "Malaria Pills," "Surgical Decay Removal Paste," and other pills, powders, creams, and needles such as "Compound Calcium Oxide," totaling more than forty kinds, solving the medication problem of the entire brigade and helping the villagers cure many diseases. He also sold some medicines to solve part of the economic difficulties for the public.
　　In the spring of 1942, the troops moved from Mizhi to the famous Nanniwan in northern Shaanxi. At that time, the Kuomintang's four hundred thousand troops did not fight the Japanese, but besieged the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Their slogan was to trap us to death in this poor place in northern Shaanxi. Our troops were responsible for defending the border region and could not increase the burden on the people of northern Shaanxi. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu proposed the policy of stationing troops. At this time, Old Jiang proposed to General Wang Zhen (then the Brigade Commander of the 359th Brigade) to change his profession, not to work in the health team anymore, but to go to the mountains to open up a farm. After his repeated requests, the superiors agreed to him, asked him to be the director of the Jiulongquan 719th Regiment Farm in Nanniwan, and allocated more than one hundred surplus personnel to him to open up mountains and cultivate land.
　　When they arrived at the farm, it was actually a wilderness of overgrown grass and trees. Old Jiang personally planned to find land, organize labor, and prepare for land reclamation and production. He carried out effective political and ideological education for this group of surplus personnel preparing for demobilization. Under the unified regulations of the superiors, a balance between public and private interests was implemented. Everyone's production enthusiasm was high. Under his hard work in taking the lead in labor, more than 400 acres of land had been reclaimed and planted with crops. In his spare time, he also organized everyone to engage in sideline production, established a woodworking factory, a rice mill, a medicine-making group, a tea-making group, a weaving group, and a charcoal-burning group, so that everyone could make the most of their strengths and be properly placed. He also established a transportation and marketing cooperative to promptly transport sideline products to various places for sale. After less than a year of painstaking management, their production income solved two months' worth of food for all the personnel of the farm, more than 3,000 sets of cotton clothes for the entire regiment, and also handed over a portion to the superiors. Each person on the farm was given a leather overcoat, a blanket, and cash savings. Old Jiang was a man who couldn't stand idleness. He used his spare time to plant more than 4,700 peach trees, 2,600 walnut trees, and grafted fifty or sixty pear trees. He collected various flower seeds in Yan'an and scattered them all over the mountains. The farm set up a magnificent gate, the cave dwellings where the farm lived were very clean, and there were also two pavilions where they could rest and sit. A large road was opened outside the farm, with flowers, grass, and trees neatly arranged on both sides, and not a single weed could be seen. The people on the farm seemed to be living in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. Everyone had food and clothing, a rich life, and a beautiful environment. Jiulongquan (their residence) became a scenic spot (under the joint efforts of various troops, the barren Nanniwan was developed into the "Jiangnan of Northern Shaanxi"). Once, Comrade Xie Juezai went to the farm to see Old Jiang and sent him a seven-character poem: "Soldier, farmer, etiquette, and music, proficient in all, Hands, feet, mind, and spirit, excelling in everything, Having traversed the nine continents, returning to establish a garden, An old monkey in the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit." Indeed, his farm achieved partial self-sufficiency in the first year, complete self-sufficiency in the second year, and abundance in the third year.
　　In the winter of 1945, he arrived in Zhangjiakou. In 1946, he became the director of the farm (vegetable garden) of the then Jin-Chahar-Hebei Military Region. The old director led more than forty prisoners from the military law office and planted more than one hundred acres of vegetable fields, supplying all the vegetables for the headquarters, the political department, and five or six other units, and also sold many. At the end of the year, after deducting all expenses, he made a net profit of more than 11 million border currency (equivalent to more than 100,000 catties of millet). More importantly, because he cared for his comrades and patiently educated them, he transformed all forty prisoners, and several production models emerged.
　　When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launched a nationwide counter-revolutionary civil war, Old Jiang repeatedly requested to go to the front line. At the beginning of 1947, he obtained permission from his superiors and went to the front, serving as the deputy director of the first branch of the Peace Hospital. Later, they received 1,200 wounded soldiers from the Qingfengdian and Shijiazhuang battles. He personally led the most difficult to manage and most problematic Third Company (more than 400 lightly wounded soldiers), and through continuous inspiration, education, and taking the lead in labor, he created the model Third Company. He is currently working as the Deputy Section Chief of the Business Section of the Chahar Military Region Production Cooperative General Branch. This spring, when the troops in Zhangjiakou planted trees, this 73-year-old man still did not hesitate to work hard, running all over the mountains and guiding the troops to plant 200,000 trees. In the early summer of this year, he again requested to join the comfort group to visit the troops engaged in canal construction and production in the Datong area.
　　He is seventy-three years old this year, but he is very strong, and his political ambition is no less than that of ordinary young revolutionary soldiers. This time, he is attending the National Congress of Laborers, Model Workers, and Soldiers, and he has prepared a challenge to the national model workers: he will always be loyal to serving the people, promote the role of role models, dedicate his life to the Party and the people, and vow to carry the revolution through to the end. He resolutely opposes American imperialist aggression and is determined to defend world peace. If the American imperialists dare to take risks, he will not admit his old age, will not fear sacrifice, and will resolutely defend the motherland's territory and people.

　　七十三岁的老英雄——蒋维平
    秦江
    蒋维平同志是一位部队模范工作者，现任察哈尔军区生产合作总分社经营科副科长。他六十岁时参加部队，不久即参加中国共产党，在部队参加过医务、农场等工作，建立了许多功绩。当他在农场工作时，谢觉哉同志曾送给他一首七言诗：
    “兵农礼乐般般会，
    手脚心神件件优，
    九洲踏遍归立圃，
    花果山中一老猴。”
    这次被选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议代表，他在出席前，并准备了一份向全国劳模提出的挑战书；要求永远忠诚为人民服务，发扬英模的作用。他坚决反对美帝侵略，决心保卫世界和平。
    七十三岁的老英雄蒋维平，原是陕甘宁边区的劳动英雄兼模范工作者。他是河北房山县人，家境贫苦，当过学徒，扛过长工，也在煤矿和旧军队干过事。一九一九年，他被军阀部队撤职回乡，便开始研究西医，开设了一个乡村医院和一个西药房，救治穷人。他经过了这样多年的奔波和磨练，逐渐的发现了一条道路——跟共产党走。他六十岁那年（一九三八年）二月，八路军三五九旅一部挺进平西，他就带上自己的全部药品参加了革命，在部队当医生治疗伤病员。两个月后，他便加入了中国共产党。他自己说：“入党后，我的终身算是有了依归了。我决心以终身献给党和人民，自己没有其他的私人欲望。”从此他接受党的教育，进一步改造思想，全心全意为党工作，为人民服务。
    半年后，他带来的西药用尽了。他读了毛主席的《论持久战》，发愁了。“持久战，对呵！我们要持久抗战”。“可是，医药怎么办呢？”他想来想去，有一个办法可以解决——用中药。于是他随着军队每到一个地方，就找村干部打听谁家有什么秘方。打听到后，他就亲自到老乡家去访问，用持久抗战全民抗战的道理去说服，记下了那些秘方。有治疟疾的，有治伤寒的……总共访到秘方三百多种。最有用的有四十多种。然后，他又每到一个地方，找到认识草药的老乡，亲自陪着，爬上高山峻岭，请老乡找出药草，讲清药名、效用和采期。同时，他又找中药铺和乡村中医，请教制药和用药法，又借到了一些制药书，经过了几番研究，初步成功了。于是，他就领着小看护们上山去采药，回来找了些沙锅，铁锅，甚至茶壶，架起火来，小看护们一面熬药，他就一面诊断，为战士们治病。他的西医是半路出家，而对于中医就更是外行呵。可是他不怕劳苦的采药制药，煞费心机的研究，诊断时多盘问，多考查，大胆而又小心的用药，终于克服了医药的困难，治好了战士们的病。在那样艰苦的敌后游击战争中，三四年来没有使他的部队发生过药品困难，而且还帮助老乡治了不少病。
    一九四一年春季，三五九旅到了陕北米脂县，全旅集中驻防，病号可不少，药品却一点也没有。这时，蒋老便自报奋勇要给旅卫生部制药。老头子带着四十多个小鬼，到无定河岸边扫括雪白的白碱（芒硝），他拿这些原料，熬煎沉淀，试验配制。那时他自己也病着，可是他仍然不断的苦心试验，经过四五次的失败，终于在二十多天内制成了当时部队急迫需用的硫酸钠，与舶来品有同等效力，而且没有沉淀。制成了大批硫酸钠后，接着他又多方采集研究，利用陕北的土产动植矿物原料，陆续配制成了“疥疮一扫光”，“光明眼药散”，“疟疾丸”，“外科治腐膏”等丸散膏丹和针药“复方氧化钙”等共达四十余种，解决了全旅的用药问题，帮助老乡治好了许多病。并出卖些药品，为公家解决了一部分经济困难。
    一九四二年春天，部队从米脂到了有名的陕北南泥湾。那时候，胡匪的四十万人马不打日本，而围困着陕甘宁边区，他们的口号是要把我们困死在陕北这个穷地方。我们部队担负着保卫边区的任务，又不能增加陕北人民的负担，毛主席朱总司令便提出了屯兵政策。这时候，蒋老便向王震将军（当时的三五九旅旅长）提出要改行，不干这卫生队了，他要上山去开辟农场。经过他再三的要求，上级才答应了他，叫他当南泥湾九龙泉七一九团农场的场长，拨给他一百多个编余的人员去开山种地。
    到了农场，实际是一片草木丛生的荒山，蒋老便亲自筹划找地，组织劳动力，准备开荒生产。他对这一批准备复员的编余人员，进行了有力的政治思想教育。在上级的统一规定下，实行了公私兼顾。大家的生产情绪高涨了，在他辛辛苦苦带头劳动下，已开出了四百多亩地，种上了作物。农余时间，他又组织大家搞副业生产，成立了木工厂，碾米坊，制药组，制茶组，编织组，烧木炭组，使每个人各尽所长，各得其所。又成立了运销合作社，及时的把副业生产品运往各地出售。这样经过不到一年的苦心经营，他们的生产所得，解决了农场全体人员两个月的食粮，全团三千多套棉衣，又交了一部分给上级。农场人员每个人置了一件皮大衣，一床毛毯，还有现款积蓄。蒋老是一个闲不得的人，他利用公余时间，种了四千七百多棵桃树，二千六百棵核桃，接了五六十棵梨树。他到延安搜集了各色花籽，撒了个满山遍野。农场设立了壮观的大门，农场里住的窑洞非常整洁，还有两座亭子可以休息坐坐。农场外开辟了一条大马路，两旁花草树木井井有条，见不到一棵杂草。农场里的人们，好像住在花果山上了。大家有吃有穿，生活丰裕，环境优美，九龙泉（他们的驻地）变成了一个风景区（在各部队共同努力下，把荒凉的南泥湾开辟成“陕北江南”）。有一次谢觉哉同志到农场去看蒋老，送给他一首七言诗：“兵农礼乐般般会，手脚心神件件优，九洲踏遍归立圃，花果山中一老猴。”的确，他的农场第一年达到了部分自给，第二年全部自供自给，第三年便丰衣足食了。
    一九四五年冬，他到了张家口，一九四六年当了当时晋察冀军区农场（菜园）的场长。老场长带着四十多个军法处的犯人，种了一百多亩菜地，供给了司令部、政治部五六个单位的全部吃菜，并且出卖了许多。年终结账时，除了一切开支，还净赚了当时的边币一千一百多万元（约合小米十万余斤）。更由于他关心同志，耐心教育，把这四十多个犯人都改造好了，而且出现了好几个生产模范。
    当蒋介石匪帮发动了全国性的反革命内战后，蒋老就屡次的要求上前线。一九四七年初，得到上级的许可，到了前方，担任和平医院一分院副院长。后来他们接收了清风店、石家庄两战役下来的一千二百名伤员。他亲自带着最难管理、问题最多的第三连（四百多个轻伤员），经过不断的启发教育和带头劳动，创造了模范的第三连。现在他担任察哈尔军区生产合作总分社经营科副科长工作。今年春天张家口部队植树时，这个七十三岁的老人，仍然不辞劳累的满山奔波，指导部队植树二十万株。今年夏初，他又要求参加慰问团，到大同一带慰问修渠生产的部队。
    今年他是七十三岁了，但身体很健壮，而且政治上的上进心更是不下于一般年轻的革命军人。他这一次参加全国工农兵劳模代表会议，又准备了一份向全国劳模提出的挑战书：他要永远忠诚的为人民服务，发扬英模的作用。终身献给党和人民，誓将革命进行到底。他坚决反对美帝侵略，决心保卫世界和平，如果美帝敢来冒险，他将不服年老，不怕牺牲，坚决的捍卫祖国领土与人民。
