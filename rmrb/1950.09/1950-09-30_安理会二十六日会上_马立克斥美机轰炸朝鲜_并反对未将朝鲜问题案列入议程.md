Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 28th: According to TASS reports, the Security Council convened on the afternoon of September 26th.

　　The meeting began by hearing the translation of the speech made by Soviet Representative Malik at the previous meeting regarding the US proposal on the Korean question. Following this, the provisional agenda for the current meeting, which had already been drafted, was examined. This included: (1) The accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan; (2) Egypt's accusation against Israel; (3) The Kashmir issue; (4) Indonesia's application to join the United Nations.

　　Malik opposed the exclusion of the Korean question, which had not been fully discussed at the previous meeting, from the agenda, pointing out that this was contrary to procedural rules. Malik requested that the Security Council member states pay attention to the telegrams sent by Park Hon-yong, Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, on September 7th and September 18th regarding the barbaric bombing and strafing of peaceful Korean residents by the US Air Force, and that they be dealt with immediately. He emphasized that as a result of pressure exerted by the United States, which continues its aggression in Korea, representatives of several countries deliberately evaded and were unwilling to take a decision on this important issue. However, these barbaric actions of the United States in bombing peaceful residents continue, and the United States has flagrantly violated recognized rules of international law. The Soviet delegation therefore proposed that the Security Council adopt a resolution instructing the United States government to cease the barbaric bombing and strafing of peaceful residents and cities in Korea.

　　However, due to the manipulation of the majority by the US-British bloc, the meeting ultimately only approved the inclusion of Indonesia's application to join the United Nations and the accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan on the agenda.

　　After debating Indonesia's application to join the United Nations, the Security Council passed the application with ten votes in favor and decided to recommend it to the United Nations General Assembly.

　　Malik spoke again, recalling the Soviet delegation's proposal, made a long time ago, to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend, and insisted that this proposal must be discussed first when discussing the Taiwan issue.

　　US Representative Gross then delivered a lengthy debate, attempting to prove that the Soviet Union's efforts in the General Assembly and the Security Council to promote discussion of the Taiwan issue would cause confusion.

　　When Malik attempted to respond to Gross, Chairman Jebb rudely interrupted him by banging his gavel. The meeting passed a motion to adjourn with eight votes in favor, the Soviet Union voting against, and Yugoslavia and India abstaining.

　　安理会二十六日会上
    马立克斥美机轰炸朝鲜
    并反对未将朝鲜问题案列入议程
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十八日讯：安全理事会九月二十六日下午开会。
    会议首先听取苏联代表马立克在上次会议上就美国所提出的朝鲜问题提案所发表的演说的译文。接着便审议已拟就的本次会议的临时议程，包括：（一）控诉武装侵略台湾案；（二）埃及控诉以色列案；（三）克什米尔问题；（四）印尼申请加入联合国案。
    马立克反对没有把上次会议未讨论完的朝鲜问题案列入议程，指出这是不合程序规则的。马立克要求安理会理事国注意朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外相朴宪永在九月七日及九月十八日拍来的关于美国空军野蛮轰炸与扫射朝鲜和平居民的电报，并立即予以处理。他着重指出：由于继续在朝鲜进行侵略的美国施加压力的结果，有几个国家的代表存心规避，而不愿在这个重要问题上采取决定。但是，美国的这种野蛮轰炸和平居民的行动仍在继续中，美国已横暴地违反了公认的国际法规则。苏联代表团因此提议要求安理会作出决议，训令美国政府停止对朝鲜和平居民和城市的野蛮轰炸及扫射。
    但是，由于美英集团操纵多数会议最后仅通过将印尼申请加入联合国案及控诉武装侵略台湾案列入议程。
    安理会就印尼申请加入联合国案进行辩论后，即以十票赞成通过这一申请而决定向联合国大会推荐。
    马立克再次发言，追述苏联代表团很早以前就提出邀请中华人民共和国代表出席的提议，并坚持在讨论台湾问题时必须首先讨论这个提议。
    美国代表葛罗斯接着发表冗长的辩论，企图证明苏联在联大及安理会力促讨论台湾问题将引起混乱。
    马立克要答复葛罗斯时，主席杰伯竟粗暴地以小槌击桌打断了他的说话。会议以八票赞成通过休会，苏联投票反对，南斯拉夫及印度弃权。
