　　On the Tasks of the "Red Youth" Magazine (Note)
　　　　Stalin
　　Note: Stalin's short article was first published in the first (fifth) issue of "Red Youth" in January 1925 and is now included in Volume 7 of "The Complete Works of Stalin" published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House in 1947. This article contains two pertinent general instructions for our magazine circles: First, magazines, like newspapers, should be weapons for uniting the masses to conduct criticism to improve work, and should not simply publish a pile of insignificant and aimless articles in each issue; second, each magazine should have its own specific task needed for the people's cause, and should not repeat each other – at least, repetition should be avoided as much as possible.
　　　　——Editor

　　Comrade Stalin, in a conversation with the editorial staff regarding the tasks of the magazine, stated the following:

　　This magazine should take as its basic task the absorption of non-Party college students from the proletariat to participate in the work of the Soviet regime and the Communist Party. This can only be done when the magazine actually becomes a genuine Soviet college student magazine. The work of higher education institutions, the People's Education Committee, and other organs certainly has many shortcomings. College students know these shortcomings more clearly than anyone else. They should expose, criticize, and point out these shortcomings in order to improve our work with joint efforts. Therefore, it is necessary to widely absorb outstanding elements from among the non-Party proletarian college students to participate in running this magazine. College students should feel that this is their own magazine that can help them work and develop.

　　Comrade Stalin, when speaking about the magazine's columns, pointed out the following:

　　The political column of this magazine must only clarify the basic issues in the work of the Party and the Soviet regime. There is no need to make copies of other magazines here. Each of our Soviet publications should have its own specific position in the overall work. The columns that should be greatly developed are: "College Student Life," "Literature and Art," and "Science and Technology." These are precisely the columns in which college students themselves can actively participate and express themselves. In the "Higher Education Reform" column, in addition to teachers and professors, college students must also be involved in solving individual problems.

　　This magazine will be able to better fulfill its tasks and truly become its own organ magazine for Soviet college students when it implements the slogan "Rely on College Students."

　　(Note) "Red Youth" was a monthly magazine for college students; from May 1924 to November 1925, it was published by the Central and Moscow Proletarian College Student Standing Bureau. Molotov was the editor-in-chief of "Red Youth." In November 1925, the magazine was renamed "Red College Student." ——Editorial Department of the Russian edition of "The Complete Works of Stalin," Volume 7

　　论《红色青年》杂志的任务（注）
    斯大林
    注斯大林的这篇短文第一次发表于一九二五年一月《红色青年》第一（五）期，现在编入一九四七年苏联国家政治书籍出版局印行的《斯大林全集》第七卷。这篇文章对于我们的杂志界有两个切中时弊的一般性指示：第一，杂志和报纸一样，应当是团结群众进行批评以改进工作的武器，而不应当每期不关痛痒地无目的地发表一堆文章完事；第二，各个杂志应当有自己的为人民事业所需要的特定的任务，而不应当互相重复，——至少应当尽可能避免重复。
    ——编者
    斯大林同志在与编辑人员的谈话中论到该杂志的任务时，声明如下：
    这个杂志应当把吸收无产阶级的非党的大学生来参加苏维埃政权和共产党的工作作为自己的基本任务。这一点只有这个杂志在事实上成为真正的苏维埃大学生杂志的时候才能办到。高级学校、人民教育委员会以及其他机关的工作，当然还有许多缺点。大学生对这些缺点比任何人都知道得清楚，他们应当揭发，批评和指出这些缺点，以便用共同的力量来改善我们的工作。因此，必须广泛地吸收非党的无产阶级大学生中间的优秀分子来参加办理这个杂志。大学生应当感到这是他们自己的能帮助他们工作和发展的杂志。
    斯大林同志讲到该杂志各栏时，指出如下：
    这个杂志的政治栏所必须阐明的只是党和苏维埃政权工作中的基本问题。在这里用不着去作其他杂志的副本。我们苏联的每一种刊物在总的工作中应当有自己特定的岗位。应当有巨大发展的是以下各栏：《大学生生活》栏，《文艺》栏，《科学技术》栏。这些正是大学生自己能积极参加和表现自己的各栏。在《高级学校改革》栏里，除了教师和教授而外，同时必须吸收大学生参加解决个别问题。
    这个杂志在实行“向大学生靠拢”这个口号时，就能更好地完成自己的任务，真正成为苏维埃大学生自己的机关杂志。
    （注）《红色青年》是大学生月刊；从一九二四年五月到一九二五年十一月系中央和莫斯科无产阶级大学生常务局出版。《红色青年》的主编是莫洛托夫。一九二五年十一月该杂志改名为《红色大学生》。——《斯大林全集》第七卷俄文版编辑部注
