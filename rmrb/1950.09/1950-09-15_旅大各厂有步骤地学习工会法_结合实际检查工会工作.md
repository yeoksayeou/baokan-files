[Dalian News] *Lüda People's Daily* news: Factories in Lüda are conscientiously studying the Trade Union Law, combining it with practical situations to inspect trade union work. Most units have formulated study plans for learning the Trade Union Law, and some have already begun to study systematically according to the plans. The Dalian Port Trade Union first had its main cadres study, made a preliminary summary, and then organized group leader-level trade union cadres to study and discuss based on the summary, deeply reviewing the trade union's work. They also used various spare time to explain the Trade Union Law to the workers. The Dalian Transportation Company Trade Union had cadres who studied at the Trade Union Law training class organized by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions give reports, and then organized workers to conduct discussions. The Dalian Machinery Factory organized more than ninety cadres above the branch committee level into a study class. In addition to the Trade Union Law, the study materials of each factory also included documents such as Stalin's and Mao Zedong's on criticism and self-criticism, and Comrade Deng Zihui's report at the enlarged meeting of the Preparatory Committee of the Central and Southern China Federation of Trade Unions.

During the study, trade union work was inspected in accordance with the spirit of the Trade Union Law, focusing on the following aspects: (1) Trade union cadres have insufficient understanding or lack experience in focusing on production. Many trade union cadres have not yet realized that production competition should be a regular activity and the main way for trade unions to promote production; therefore, most of the competitions organized in the past were shock-style. For example, the Dalian Transportation Company used to organize production competitions as follows: when the movement came, it was bustling, and after the upsurge passed, it died out on its own. Trade union cadres of Jianxin Company reviewed, "In the past, we thought that production competition was a shock-style work, and we had to stop and rest for a period of time before doing it again." Another manifestation of insufficient understanding of focusing on production is that the various departments of the trade union cannot carry out their work around production, and are trapped in the circle of事務ism. For example, the production committee of the Jianxin Company Trade Union is busy all day long compiling various statistics, and rarely goes deep into the front line to understand production problems; the cultural and educational departments of the Dalian Transportation Company and other factory trade unions are mostly busy printing teaching materials, writing slogans, and compiling materials, and rarely conduct publicity and mobilization work aimed at production; the organization department collects membership fees, renews membership cards, introduces membership relations, etc., and is busy all day long without leaving the desk. (2) Insufficient understanding of the mass character of the trade union, picking faults when recruiting members, and having a tendency toward closed-doorism. To this day, 20% to 30% of the employees of the Dalian Kiln Factory and the Metal Machinery Factory have not been admitted to the trade union, and this situation is still quite common. (3) Trade union cadres are bureaucratic and not concerned enough about welfare, labor protection, and health work. For example, the workers' dormitory in the Dalian Kiln Factory is very bad, leaking when it rains, and too crowded, and some workers who sleep outside get sick, but the trade union cadres do not make suggestions and cooperate with the administration to solve the problem in a timely manner; the Jianxin Company Trade Union conducts very poor safety education for workers, and there were more than 40 personal accidents in the company's factories in the first half of the year; the trade union cadres of the Dalian Transportation Company reviewed that they approached the masses like a dragonfly skimming the water. When workers raise various difficulties, they do not actively think of ways to solve them or patiently explain them, but only shout some political slogans to the workers, making the workers feel that the trade union is just giving blind orders and cannot solve problems. In addition, many factory trade unions do not promote democracy enough and do not report their work to members for years.

An important reason why many trade union cadres have a事務ist style of work and are busy and chaotic is that they have not mobilized everyone to do trade union work, and have not given play to the organizational strength. Big and small things are only done by a few cadres who are divorced from production, which makes the cadres isolated.

Some factory trade unions have already started to improve the shortcomings that have been identified, and some trade unions have begun to transform shock-style competitions into organized and regular production competitions; the Dalian Transportation Company has formulated specific methods on how to further focus on production and closely contact the workers, mobilize everyone to run the trade union, and enrich the content of trade union group activities.

### 旅大各厂有步骤地学习工会法  结合实际检查工会工作

　　旅大各厂有步骤地学习工会法
    结合实际检查工会工作
    【大连讯】旅大人民日报消息：旅大各厂认真学习工会法，结合实际，检查工会工作。对工会法的学习，大部分单位都订了学习计划，有的已根据计划有步骤地进行学习。大连海港工会先由主要干部学习，做出初步总结，再组织小组长一级工会干部，根据总结进行学习讨论，深入检讨工会工作，并利用各种业余时间，向工人讲解工会法。大连交通公司工会是由在总工会所办的工会法训练班学习的干部作传达报告，然后组织工人进行讨论。大连机械工厂工会将支会委员以上的九十余名干部组成学习班。各厂学习材料除工会法以外，并有斯大林、毛泽东论批评与自我批评，邓子恢同志在中南区总工会筹委扩大会上的报告等文件。
    在学习中，曾根据工会法的精神检查工会工作，着重检查了以下几方面的问题：（一）工会干部对面向生产认识不足或缺乏经验。许多工会干部还没有认识到生产竞赛应是经常性的，是工会推动生产的主要方式；所以，过去组织的竞赛大多是突击性的。如大连交通公司过去组织生产竞赛是：运动来了，热火朝天，热潮过去，自消自灭。建新公司工会干部检讨道：“过去我们认为生产竞赛是突击性的工作，到一定阶段必须停下休息一个时期再搞。”对面向生产认识不足的另一种表现，是工会各部门不能围绕着生产进行工作，陷在事务主义圈子里。如建新公司工会生产委员整天忙于统计各种数目字，很少深入现场了解生产问题；大连交通公司及其他工厂工会的文教部多是忙着印发教材、写标语、统计材料，很少针对生产进行宣传鼓动工作；组织部则收会费，换发会员证，介绍会员关系等，整天忙的离不开桌子。（二）对工会的群众性认识不足，在吸收会员时挑小毛病，有关门主义偏向。大连窑厂、金属机械工厂至今还有百分之二十至三十的职工未被吸收入工会，此种情形还相当普遍。（三）工会干部官僚主义，对福利、劳保、卫生工作关心不够。如大连窑厂工人宿舍很不好，下雨漏水，住的又太挤，有些工人在外边露宿得了病，工会干部也不提意见和配合行政及时解决；建新公司工会对工人安全教育进行甚差，该公司各厂上半年发生人身事故四十余次；大连交通公司工会干部检讨自己接近群众时像蜻蜓点水，一掠而过。工人提出各种困难，也不积极想办法解决或耐心进行解释，只是向工人喊出些政治口号，使工人觉得：工会只是瞎招呼，不能解决问题。另外，还有很多工厂工会发扬民主不够，成年累月不向会员报告工作。
    很多工会干部所以存在事务主义作风，工作忙乱，其重要原因之一是由于未发动大家来做工会工作，未发挥组织力量，大小事情都只是由几位脱离生产干部来作，致使干部陷于孤立。
    对检查出的缺点，有些工厂工会已着手改进，有的工会已开始将突击式的竞赛转变为有组织的经常性的生产竞赛；大连交通公司对如何进一步面向生产和密切联系工人群众，发动大家办工会，充实工会小组活动的内容等问题，已订出具体办法。
