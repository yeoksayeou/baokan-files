Agricultural Scientist Li Ming
　　Zhang Jingtao
　　Comrade Li Ming was elected as a representative to the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Workers and Peasants for his successful research in preventing and controlling wheat bunt and dwarf bunt.

　　In recent years, wheat bunt and dwarf bunt have been relatively serious in Shandong. According to incomplete surveys in the province in 1949, the disease occurred in 57 counties, with an incidence rate of up to 30%, and in severe cases, over 90%. It was estimated that wheat production was reduced by more than 50 million catties. Farmers complained and blamed fate without any solutions.

　　In the spring of 1946, Comrade Li Ming learned about the damage caused by bunt and dwarf bunt at a symposium in the Provincial Agricultural Cadre Training Class, and began to pay attention to the problem. After the wheat harvest that year, more than 800 catties of bunt grains were collected when the public grain was collected in Dashanqian Village near the station. It was estimated that the village could harvest more than 4,000 catties of wheat less that year. Similar situations existed in nearby villages, so he paid more attention to this problem and regarded it as one of the important experimental research works.

　　He first consulted several agricultural books, which all stated that the disease was transmitted by seeds. At that time, he thought this was correct. In addition to publishing articles in newspapers advocating various methods of seed disinfection, he also sent someone to Dashanqian Village to guide the masses in seed disinfection during the autumn planting. The person also personally helped several households to soak seeds in warm water, copper sulfate, and lime water, etc., to demonstrate to the masses. The Dadian Farm also conducted seed inoculation experiments. The following year (1947), after the wheat harvest, Comrade Li Ming went to the village to check the results. Some said that the bunt had decreased, some said it was the same as last year, and some said it was even more severe than last year. Obviously, this prevention and control guidance failed.

　　The failure of the above experiments caused his suspicion, and he believed that there must be other routes of transmission besides seed transmission. Comrade Li Ming repeatedly considered this issue, so he decided on a method: to be determined to investigate among the masses, learn from the masses, and summarize and experiment after in-depth investigation and research.

　　In the summer of 1947, when the enemy was still frantically attacking Shandong, Comrade Li Ming began his planned investigation. In more than a dozen rural villages in Junan County, he individually interviewed 17 households severely affected by bunt and dwarf bunt. He also held symposiums for several village cadres and mutual aid groups to listen to everyone's experience, and came to a preliminary conclusion: that the main cause of the disease was fertilizer; seeds were secondary. From many investigation materials, it can be seen that bacteria can be transmitted into the manure by wind, water, soil, and wheat bran, and the manure collected from diseased plants fed to livestock is also very likely to be infectious.

　　In order to confirm this preliminary conclusion, during the autumn planting that year, he started more than 20 kinds of experimental methods in Shizilu Farm, Ju County Farm and Xiaoguanzhuang Farm according to a unified plan. At the same time, he also found dozens of contracted farmers in many villages to do the same experiments, for a total of more than 100 times.

　　The results of these experiments unanimously proved that the preliminary investigation conclusion was completely correct. Before the wheat harvest in 1948, he investigated two districts in Ju County and came to the same conclusion. In 1948 and 1949, he repeated experiments, demonstrations, and investigations in many farms and farmers' households, which fully proved that fertilizer is the main transmission medium. How could it not fail in the past when only seed treatment was advocated? His research on prevention and control methods must start from two aspects: on the one hand, the seeds must be cleaned, and more importantly, the fertilizer should not be mixed with bacteria. It has also been proven that: (1) If there are bacteria in the fertilizer, the fertilizer and seeds can be isolated during sowing; (2) The simplest and most effective method for cleaning seeds is to select seeds with salt water or muddy water and wash them with clean water, without using any chemical disinfection or warm water treatment. This year, the most complete method of isolating fertilizer and wheat seeds has been summarized, which is to apply fertilizer to the soil first, cover it with a thin layer of soil, and then sow and cover the soil, which has a very good disease prevention effect and normal wheat growth. The peasants accepted this method and automatically created improved planters, which are powerful agricultural tools for implementing the separation of fertilizer and seeds. The East China Agricultural Science Research Institute also proved that the spores discharged from the feces of horses, cattle, and sheep that have eaten bunt wheat still germinate, confirming the correctness of Comrade Li Ming's experimental conclusion.

　　In the past, Wangjiazhuangzi, Ju County, which was the most seriously affected by bunt and dwarf bunt, has greatly reduced bunt and dwarf bunt due to the adoption of prevention and control measures. In 1948, bunt wheat accounted for 55% of the village, in 1949 it only accounted for 12%, and in 1950 it was only 3 per thousand. Dashanqian Village harvested 10,130 catties of bunt in 1948, which was reduced to 1,397 catties in 1949, and only about 100 catties of bunt were harvested this year. Bunt has been basically eliminated in these two villages. Wulian County reduced wheat production by more than 2.8 million catties last year due to bunt, which has been reduced to 1.79 million catties this year, increasing production by more than 1 million catties. Jiuli District of Ju County has dropped from a disease rate of 10% to 4%.

　　Comrade Li Ming is currently the director of the Shandong Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute. In addition to his successful research in the prevention and control of wheat bunt and dwarf bunt, he has also studied wheat nematode disease for three years and obtained simple prevention and control methods; he has studied stalk smut for two years and this year has surveyed nearly 200 wheat fields in more than a dozen counties, and has obtained preliminary conclusions; he is starting to study various smut diseases of millet and sorghum. In the process of smut disease research, he deeply realized that it is not feasible to rely solely on past books. He said: "Seeking truth from facts, learning from the masses, investigation and research, and repeated experiments are the main reasons for this success, and also the main direction of future research work." This is a valuable experience for agricultural scientists.

　　农业科学工作者李明

    李明同志是以研究防治小麦腥乌麦病成功，而当选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表的。
    近年来山东的小麦腥乌麦病是比较严重的。一九四九年据全省不完全的调查，发病地区有五十七个县，发病率多达百分之三十，严重的达百分之九十以上，估计减产小麦约五千万斤之多。农民怨天尤命毫无办法。
    一九四六年春，李明同志在省农业干部训练班座谈会中，了解了一些关于腥乌麦为害情况，便开始注意了腥乌麦的问题。当年麦收后，驻地附近大山前村收公粮时，收起八百多斤乌麦粒，估计当年全村共能少收四千多斤麦子。临近其他村庄也有同样情况，因此他更加重视了这个问题，把它当做重要试验研究工作之一。
    他首先参看了几种农业书籍，那些书上，都说这种病害是由种子传染的，当时他以为这是对的。他除在报纸上发表文章提倡各种办法实行种子消毒外。秋种时又派了专人到大山前村指导群众实行种子消毒，去的人并亲自动手帮助几户用温汤浸种，用硫酸铜、石灰水浸种等。以向群众示范。大店农场又作了种子接种试验。第二年（一九四七年）麦收后李明同志到该村检查结果，有的说乌麦减少了，有的说和去年一样，更有的说比去年还厉害了。很明显的，这一次的防除指导是失败了。
    由于以上试验失败，引起他的怀疑，认为除了种子传染而外一定还有另外传染途径。李明同志反复的考虑着这个问题，因此确定了一个办法：下决心向群众调查，向群众学习，深入调查研究以后再来总结与试验。
    一九四七年夏，敌人还在疯狂的向山东进攻，李明同志却开始了他的有计划的调查工作，在莒南县十几个农村中，个别的访问了十七家腥乌麦严重户。并召开了若干村干部、变工组等座谈会，听取了大家的经验，得出了初步结论：即发病原因主要的还是粪；种子倒是其次。从许多调查材料中看出，病菌由风、由水、由泥土、由麦糠中都可以传播到粪内，病株喂牲口攒的粪，也大有传染的可能。
    为了证实这个初步的结论，当年秋种时，他在十字路农场、莒县农场及小官庄农场三个地方，按照统一的计划开始作了二十多种方法的试验。同时又找了许多村几十家特约农户作了同样一些试验，共总作了一百多次。
    这些试验的结果，一致证明初步调查的结论是完全正确的。一九四八年麦收前又在莒县调查了两个区，也得出一致的结论。一九四八、一九四九一连两年又在许多农场、农户中重复试验、示范和调查，完全证明粪是主要的传染媒介，过去单单提倡处理种子，那能不失败呢？他研究防除的方法必须从两方面着手：一方面要清洁种子，更重要的一方面是不要叫粪里混进病菌去。并且证明：（一）如果粪里有了病菌，由播种时可把粪和种子隔离；（二）清洁种子最简单而有效的办法是盐水或泥水选种与清水洗种，不必用什么药剂消毒和温汤处理。今年并总结出粪与麦种隔离的最完善办法。是：把粪先施土中，盖层薄土，再播种覆土，防病效力很好，小麦生长正常。农民接受了这个方法，自动创造出改良耩子，是实行粪、种隔离办法的有力农具。华东农业科学研究所，也证明马、牛、羊吃了腥乌麦排出的粪，病胞子仍然发芽，证实李明同志试验的结论正确。
    以往腥乌麦最严重的莒县王家庄子，由于接受了防除办法，腥乌麦大为减少。一九四八年全村腥乌麦占百分之五十五，一九四九年只占百分之十二，一九五○年仅有千分之三了。大山前村一九四八年麦收时打乌麦一○一三○斤，四九年减至一三九七斤，今年全村只打了一百来斤乌麦，这二个村子的乌麦基本上是消灭了。五莲县去年因腥乌麦少收二百八十多万斤小麦，今年已减少至一百七十九万斤，增收百多万斤。莒县九里区已由百分之十的病率降到百分之四。
    李明同志现任山东省农业科学研究所所长，除了在防治小麦腥乌麦病上有着成功的研究外，对小麦的线虫病，也研究过三年，得有简易防治办法；杆黑穗病有两年研究，今年调查有十多个县将近二百处麦田，得了初步结论；对谷子、高粱的各种黑穗病正在开始研究。他在腥黑穗病研究过程中，深深体会到单单依靠过去的书本是不行的，他说：“实事求是，向群众学习，调查研究，反复试验，就是这次成功的主要原因，也是今后研究工作的主要方向。”这是农业科学工作者宝贵的经验。
