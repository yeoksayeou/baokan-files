　　Public Grain Storage Improved in Various Parts of North China; Spoilage Phenomena Have Been Reduced
    [Our Newspaper] Public grain storage has been improved in various parts of North China, and certain achievements have been made in the past six months. Newly harvested summer wheat has now been put into storage, and as the rainy season has not completely passed, various localities are further paying attention to improving storage work.
    In overcoming the phenomenon of grain spoilage, 150 million jin of stored grain in eight special districts including Baoding in Hebei Province were inspected during the early summer rainy season and found to have no spoilage. In the first half of the year, the total amount of grain spoilage in Chahar Province decreased from 160,000 jin last year to more than 20,000 jin, a reduction of seven-eighths. The reason why the above two provinces achieved these results is primarily due to the constant supervision and inspection by the financial and grain leadership organs and cadres at all levels. During the rainy season, the Hebei Provincial Grain Bureau continuously instructed warehouses at all levels to conduct careful inspections and salvage damaged public grain. For example, when the Ninghe County Grain Depot discovered that the grain was heating up, all the cadres immediately carried out moving and turning over of the grain, and drying and ventilation, preserving 300,000 jin of grain. Secondly, in terms of storage system, the grain depots at all levels in Hebei and Chahar Provinces, in conjunction with local governments, public security, armed forces and other departments, organized public grain storage committees. In Chahar Province, by May, three-fifths of the grain depots in the province had established public grain storage committees. Under the leadership of the storage committees, the grain depots at all levels, on the one hand, established a system of division of labor with individual responsibility, regular inspections, and rewards and punishments, changing the past phenomenon of "everyone is in charge, and no one is responsible"; on the other hand, they relied on the masses of the warehouse neighbors and launched a mass grain protection movement. As of the end of April, about 80 percent of the counties in five special districts, including Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, had implemented a system of division of labor with individual responsibility and regular inspections, and most counties had organized grain protection teams for the four neighboring areas of the warehouses. In addition, Chahar repaired more than 3,000 warehouse rooms and built 86 new warehouses in the first half of the year; the cadres of the Hebei grain depots adopted farmers' methods of ventilation and straw mats to protect the grain, to make up for the lack of warehouse equipment, which also reduced or avoided grain spoilage.
    Before the general survey of grain depots in the provinces of Pingyuan, Shanxi, and Suiyuan from April to July, due to the lack of strict management systems and bureaucratic leadership, serious phenomena such as grain spoilage, embezzlement, theft, and discrepancies between the book figures and inventory figures occurred. However, these have been corrected and cleared up after the general survey. For example, in Pingyuan, through the work of merging warehouses, weighing, and accounting, more than 12 million jin of grain that had not been recorded in the past were cleared out, thereby making the book figures and inventory figures consistent. In Shanxi Province, after discovering more than one million jin of grain that had been spoiled, embezzled, stolen, or otherwise lost, all seven special districts in the province established warehouse protection committees, implemented a system of dedicated personnel responsible for storage, regular inspections, and cadre rewards; embezzlement cases have also been dealt with severely. In the Houtao and Baotou special districts of Suiyuan, before liberation, most of the public grain was entrusted to households for storage, and most of the household storage personnel were landlords. Therefore, for six or seven years, they arbitrarily misappropriated and embezzled more than 13 million jin of public grain. After the People's Government conducted a general grain survey, it merged and concentrated the more than 360 abnormally dispersed warehouses in Houtao, reducing the number of household storage depots by four-fifths; more than 360,000 jin of misappropriated and embezzled public grain have been recovered. The Suiyuan Provincial Government also promulgated interim measures for rewarding and punishing grain storage in late July, ordering grain depots at all levels to conscientiously implement the storage and disbursement system.
    According to the climate of North China, the period before September is still the rainy season, and at the same time, a large amount of newly harvested summer wheat has been put into storage. Therefore, various localities are currently further strengthening warehouse protection work to safely pass the final stage of the rainy season. For example, in order to store 2.5 million jin of new grain well, the Ninghe County Grain Depot in Hebei inspected and repaired the warehouses before receiving the grain, and established a system of general inspections every five days. The Pingyuan Provincial Government also instructed grain depots at all levels in the province in early August to pay close attention to the characteristics of the current climate, to conduct a general inspection of warehouse storage and security work, and to carry out turning over and drying of newly stored grain if it is damp.

### 华北各地改进公粮保管  霉坏现象已经减少

　　华北各地改进公粮保管  霉坏现象已经减少
    【本报讯】华北各地改进公粮保管，半年来已获一定成绩。目前夏征新麦已经入仓，雨季尚未完全过去，各地正在进一步注意改进保管工作。
    在克服粮食霉损现象上，河北保定等八个专区一亿五千万斤的库存粮，在夏初霉雨季节检查时，无一霉损；察省上半年全省粮食霉烂数字，已从去年的十六万斤降至两万余斤，减少了八分之七。上述两省之所以获得成绩，首先是各级财粮领导机关与干部的经常督促与检查。河北省粮局在霉雨季节中不断指示各级仓库认真检查，抢救受损公粮。如宁河县粮库发现粮食有发热现象时，全体干部马上进行搬运倒仓，翻晒出风，保全了三十万斤粮食。其次，在保管制度上，河北、察哈尔两省各级粮库结合当地政府、公安、武装等部门，组织了公粮保管委员会。察哈尔全省粮库中，在五月即有五分之三的粮库已建立公粮保管委员会。在保管委员会领导下，各级粮库一方面建立分工负责、定期检查和奖惩制度，改变过去“大家都管、又都不负责”的现象；另一方面依靠库邻群众，发动了群众性的护粮运动。截至四月底，河北省石家庄等五个专区百分之八十左右的县份即已执行了分工负责和定期检查制度，大部分县份并组织了仓库四邻的护粮小组。此外，察哈尔在上半年中修补了三千余间仓房和建立起八十六间新仓；河北粮库干部采用农民的通风、垫草等办法护粮，以补仓库设备的不足，也都减少或避免了粮食的霉损。
    平原、山西、绥远三省在四至七月份普查粮库工作前，由于没有严格的管理制度及领导上的官僚主义，曾发生粮食霉烂、贪污、失盗及账簿与库存数字不符的严重现象。然经过普查均已得到纠正与清理。如平原在普查中，通过并仓、过秤和算账等工作，清出过去没上账的粮食一千二百余万斤，从而使账库数字走向一致。山西省在发现有一百余万斤霉烂、贪污、失盗等损耗粮食后，全省七个专区均成立了护仓委员会，实行专人负责保管，定期检查和干部奖励等制度；对贪污案件，亦已从严处理。绥远后套及包头专区等地，因在未解放前，大部公粮系委托民户保管，而民户保管员中又多为地主，故六、七年来任意挪用、贪污的公粮达一千三百余万斤。此次人民政府经过粮食普查后，已将后套异常分散的三百六十多个仓库合并集中，减缩了六分之五的民户保管库；挪用及贪污的公粮，已追回三十六万余斤。绥远省政府并于七月下旬颁布了粮食保管奖惩暂行办法，责成各级粮库认真执行保管与支拨制度。
    按华北气候，九月前仍属雨季，同时大批夏征新麦又已入仓，故目前各地正进一步加强护仓工作，以求安全度过雨季的最后阶段。如河北宁河县粮库为了保管好二百五十万斤新粮，在收粮前，将仓房普遍检查修补了一遍，并建立起五天普查一次的制度。平原省政府亦于八月上旬指示该省各级粮库，深切注意目前气候的特点，普遍检查粮库保管及保卫工作，入仓新粮如有潮湿，应即进行翻晒。
