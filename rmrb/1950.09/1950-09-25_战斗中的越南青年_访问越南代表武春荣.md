　　Vietnamese Youth in Combat
    ——An Interview with Vietnamese Representative Vo Xuan Vinh
    The Vietnamese people's war for national liberation has been going on for more than five years. Over the past five years, the Vietnamese Liberation Army has grown in combat, and its strength has grown day by day. They have shifted from passive to active, from defense to offense, and have now liberated more than 90 percent of the country's land.
    From the very beginning, the youth of Vietnam joined the Vietnamese people in their national liberation struggle, and they have made great contributions. The war history of Vo Xuan Vinh, a young Vietnamese representative, is an example. He joined the Liberation Army during the August Revolution in Vietnam in 1945, bravely participated in the battle to defend Hanoi, and in the past few years, he has fought in various battlefields, growing from a soldier to a resourceful and brave regimental chief of staff in combat. Millions of Vietnamese youths, especially young farmers, have joined the ranks of the Liberation Army, making the Vietnamese people's armed forces increasingly strong. Countless young combat heroes have emerged in the fighting. They fought the enemy regardless of their own safety. Young warriors like Nguyen Van Soai (transliteration), who sacrificed himself to block the enemy's machine gun fire, and General Thai Dung (transliteration), the one-armed general who terrified the enemy, created brilliant achievements in the liberation war.
    Vietnamese young workers and farmers not only enthusiastically joined the army, but also actively participated in production and supported the front lines in difficult environments. In guerrilla warfare, young farmers fought the enemy by combining production and combat. They built many fortifications in the countryside, and when the enemy attacked, they laid landmines everywhere to block them; after the enemy retreated, they returned to their production posts to work. Young workers in factories worked selflessly to produce materials needed for combat. For example, Ngo Van Phu, a young worker in a certain arsenal, exceeded his production quota by 360 percent.
    Countless young intellectuals left their schools to participate in mobilizing and organizing the masses. Many young people bravely persisted in underground work in enemy-occupied areas, mobilizing the people to launch strikes, go-slows, sabotage and other struggles to strike at the enemy. Young students have made great contributions to the democratic construction in the liberated areas. Thanks to the participation of the vast number of young students in the great literacy campaign, 15 million people have been relieved of the suffering of illiteracy, and they are now moving towards the goal of completely eliminating illiteracy.
    The youth of Vietnam have realized that their national liberation struggle is part of the struggle to defend world peace. The victory they have achieved is the victory of the peace camp, and also the victory of the progressive people all over the world. While strengthening their struggle for national liberation, the youth of Vietnam also show the greatest enthusiasm for the movement to defend world peace. The peace signature campaign is not only booming in the vast Vietnamese liberated areas, but also actively being carried out in the cities occupied by the French imperialists. They are using the power of heroic combat and the peace movement to defeat the war-mongers of American and French imperialism.
    As Vietnamese youth representative Vo Xuan Vinh said, the Vietnamese national liberation struggle is a struggle in which the entire people participate against the aggressors of American and French imperialism. Now more than 20 million people across Vietnam are using all their strength to prepare for a general counter-offensive to completely defeat the enemy. Their slogan is "Everything for the front, everything for victory!"
    Under the leadership of the Viet Minh and the Vietnam Youth League, the youth of Vietnam are fighting to accomplish this sacred and great task! (With picture)

　　战斗中的越南青年
    ——访问越南代表武春荣
    越南人民争取民族解放的战争已进行五年多了。五年来越南解放军在战斗中成长，力量一天天壮大。他们从被动转为主动，从防御转为进攻，到现在已解放了全国百分之九十以上的土地。
    越南的青年一开始就和越南的人民在一起参加他们的民族解放斗争，而且有极大的贡献。越南青年代表年轻的武春荣自己的战争历史就是一个例子。他在一九四五年越南八月革命时代就参加了解放军，英勇地参加保卫河内的战斗，几年来转战各战场，从一名战士在战斗中锻炼成为一名饶勇善战的团参谋长。千百万的越南青年，尤其是青年农民，参加解放军的队伍，使越南人民的武装力量日益壮大，而且在战斗中涌现了无数年轻的战斗英雄。他们奋不顾身地与敌人作战。像舍身堵住敌人机枪射击口的阮文帅（译音），使敌人闻之丧胆的独臂将军泰勇（译音）等青年勇士，在解放战争中创造了光辉的业绩。
    越南的青年工人和农民不仅踊跃参军，而且在困难的环境中积极参加生产，支援前线。在游击战争中，青年农民们以一面生产一面战斗的方式，与敌人进行斗争。他们在乡村中建立很多的防御工事，敌人进攻，他们就四处埋地雷以阻击敌人；敌人撤退后，他们又回复到生产岗位上去工作。青年工人在工厂中以忘我的劳动，制造作战所需的物资。如某兵工厂的青年工人吴文富，他的生产成绩超过生产定额百分之三百六十。
    无数的年轻知识分子走出学校，参加动员和组织群众的工作，有许多青年勇敢地在敌人占领区坚持地下工作，动员人民展开罢工、怠工、破坏等斗争，以打击敌人。青年学生在解放区的民主建设工作中有巨大的贡献。由于广大的青年学生参加伟大的扫除文盲运动，已使一千五百万人民解除了文盲的痛苦，现在正在向着彻底消灭文盲的目标前进。
    越南的青年已认识到他们的民族解放斗争就是保卫世界和平斗争的一部分。他们所取得的胜利就是和平阵营的胜利，也就是全世界进步人民的胜利。越南的青年们一面加强他们争取民族解放的战斗，同时以最大的热忱关怀保卫世界和平的运动。和平签名的运动不但在广大的越南解放区中蓬勃展开，而且也热烈地在法帝占领下的城市中进行着。他们正以英勇的战斗与和平运动的力量，来击败美法帝国主义的战争贩子。
    正如越南青年代表武春荣所说的，越南的民族解放斗争是一个全民参加反对美法帝国主义侵略者的斗争。现在全越两千多万的人民都在以全部力量为彻底击败敌人而准备着总反攻。他们的口号是“一切为了前线，一切为了胜利！”
    越南的青年在越盟与越南青年联盟的领导下，正为完成这一神圣而伟大的任务而奋斗！（附图片）
