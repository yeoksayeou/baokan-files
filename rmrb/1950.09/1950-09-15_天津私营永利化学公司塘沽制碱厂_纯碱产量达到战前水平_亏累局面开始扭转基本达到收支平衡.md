Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 13th: The Tianjin Private Yongli Chemical Company's Tanggu Alkali Plant has reached pre-Second Sino-Japanese War levels in its soda ash production. Current daily output reaches 170-180 tons. The plant's caustic soda production is also in high demand due to the government's ban on foreign imports, with daily output increasing from 7-8 tons a month ago to 14-15 tons. Recently, the government provided a special loan of 1.6 billion yuan to help the plant expand its caustic soda factory. Due to increased production, reduced costs, and smooth sales of alkali, Yongli Company's past losses have begun to turn around, basically achieving a balance of income and expenditure.

In February and March of this year, the plant's production suffered serious difficulties due to sluggish product sales. At that time, workers made some efforts to assist the capitalists in overcoming the difficulties, such as voluntarily and appropriately reducing wages, which saved the factory 550,000 catties of corn flour per month. At the same time, the plant established a labor-capital consultation conference, and established production technology research and rationalization proposal committees under the consultation conference, striving to improve production. The workers created many amazing feats in production savings and improvement of work. For example, Zhang Yanxi, the leader of the repair group, selected many useful materials from scrap iron, which saved 270,000 catties of corn flour. Worker Yang Yanhuan suggested improving the water pipes, which improved work efficiency and saved more than ten tons of coal per day. In July, the entire plant was shut down for major repairs, which were completed in only six hours thanks to the efforts of all employees, saving more than 1,000 workdays compared to the original plan. Starting from September 1st, the plant's workers have also begun to carry out production competitions with a focus on the caustic soda plant.

Currently, the plant's problem is that it has not established a systematic reward system, and the factory has not given any rewards to the workers' various production achievements in the past year. If this shortcoming is not corrected, it will affect the continued smooth development of future production.

　　天津私营永利化学公司塘沽制碱厂
    纯碱产量达到战前水平
    亏累局面开始扭转基本达到收支平衡
    【新华社天津十三日电】天津私营永利化学公司塘沽制碱厂，所产纯碱已达到抗日战争以前的水平。目前日产量达一百七八十吨。该厂所产烧碱也由于政府禁止了外货进口，供不应求，日产量由月前七、八吨，增加到十四五吨。最近政府特贷款十六亿元帮助该厂扩建烧碱工厂。由于产量提高，成本降低，碱的销路顺畅，永利公司过去亏累的局面已开始扭转，基本上达到收支平衡。
    今年二、三月间，该厂曾因产品滞销使生产遭到严重困难，当时，职工为了协助资方克服困难，曾作了若干努力，如主动地适当减低薪资一项，每月即为工厂节省了五十五万斤玉米面的开支。同时，该厂又建立了劳资协商会议，并在协商会议下设立了生产技术研究、合理化建议等委员会，努力改进生产。职工们在生产节约和改进工作上，创造了许多惊人事迹。如修理组工长张延喜由废铁中选择出很多能用的材料，可节省玉米面二十七万斤。工人杨延焕建议改进水管，提高了工作效率，每天可省煤十余吨。七月份全厂停工大检修，在全厂职工努力下仅历六小时即告完成，较原计划节省了一千余工。九月一日起，该厂职工并已从烧碱厂开始，有重点地展开了生产竞赛。
    目前该厂存在的问题是没有建立有系统的奖励制度，一年来职工各种生产成绩都没得到厂方任何奖励。这一缺点如不纠正，将会影响今后生产继续顺畅发展。
