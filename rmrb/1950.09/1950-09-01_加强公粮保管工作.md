Strengthen the Work of Public Grain Storage
　　Public grain is the fruit of the laboring people's blood and sweat, and also an important source of financial revenue for the People's Government. Doing a good job in public grain storage is the most important task of the grain administration departments in various regions. Generally speaking, the grain storage departments in various regions are able to be proactive and responsible, constantly finding ways to protect grain, prevent grain from spoiling, and ensure that national wealth is not lost. This is commendable. However, in some areas, some departments, and some personnel do not pay enough attention to the work of public grain storage, and even adopt an irresponsible attitude, allowing the grain to spoil. Some even lend the spoiled grain to the masses, causing dissatisfaction among the masses towards the government. This is an unforgivable and serious mistake.
    The basic reason for this phenomenon is that the grain authorities in some areas do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of grain, and treat grain storage work with a bureaucratic attitude. They do not conduct strict inspections, do not pay attention to preventive work, and do not regularly educate the personnel directly responsible for grain storage. Even when large quantities of grain have spoiled, they do not take the initiative to find ways to rescue it, but only ask for instructions from and wait for instructions from higher authorities, resulting in continued spoilage and serious losses. This significant loss should arouse serious vigilance among relevant departments and party and government leading bodies in various regions. They should regularly inspect the condition of grain depots. Those that have already been found to be spoiled should be promptly rescued, while those that have not been spoiled should effectively carry out preventive work to ensure that all stored grain no longer suffers losses.

### 加强公粮保管工作

　　加强公粮保管工作
    公粮是劳动人民血汗的结晶，也是人民政府的重要财政收入。做好公粮保管工作，乃是各地粮政部门头等重要的任务。一般说来，各地粮食保管部门都能积极负责，经常设法保护粮食，防止粮食的霉烂，保证了国家财富不受损失。这是值得表扬的。但也有某些地区某些部门某些人员对公粮保管工作不够重视，甚至采取不负责任的态度，听任粮食霉烂，有的还把坏了的粮食贷给群众，引起群众对政府的不满。这是不可宽恕的严重错误。
    产生这种现象的基本原因，是某些地区粮食主管部门对粮食的重要性认识不够，以官僚主义的态度对待粮食保管工作。不严格检查，不注意预防工作，也不经常教育直接保管粮食的人员。甚至在大批粮食发生霉烂的时候，还不主动设法抢救，而只向上级请示和等待，以致继续发生霉烂，造成严重损失。此种重大的损失应该引起各地有关部门以及党政领导机关的严重警惕，应该经常检查粮库情况。对于已发现霉烂的应及时加以抢救，而对未发生霉烂的，应切实做好预防工作，保证全部库粮不再遭受损耗。
