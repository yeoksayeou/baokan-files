Xinhua News Agency, 14th: TASS, 12th: Grigorievich, in an article in Pravda, mocked the American aggressors' cheers for the Belgian Social Christian Party member and former Belgian Minister of Defense, Meulan, who volunteered to join the American invading army in Korea. He wrote: The failures of the American aggressors' bloody adventure in Korea, make them feel danger every day, forcing them to increase pressure on their vassal states, and more and more anxiously force the vassal states to send ground troops to save MacArthur. However, in the Marshallized countries and the United States, the movement to recruit volunteers has completely failed. For example, everyone knows the efforts of Gasperi, Sherba, and other gold-dollar lackeys in Rome to recruit "volunteers" for MacArthur. However, the only result of these efforts is that the signatures collected in Italy for the Stockholm Declaration have increased many times in recent weeks. The same thing is happening in Australia, the Netherlands, and other countries. Politicians in Washington know that even Americans are unwilling to go to Korea to die for the interests of the Morgan and Rockefeller families.
	Since the Korean War, the number of marriages in the United States has suddenly increased, because, until now, parents have not been drafted into the army. Regardless of their efforts, the authorities are still desperately shouting for "volunteers."
	The author satirically wrote: "At this time, a jobless knight Meulan appeared, and he finally found an opportunity to express his loyalty to the foreign old district. Washington decided to use this waste for propaganda. A minister-volunteer is indeed a novelty. The overjoyed Voice of America obviously wants to make a big noise for him until he is hoarse."

　　美帝搜罗炮灰失败
    各国人民不愿为华尔街利益送命
    真理报评美征募“志愿兵”计划的破产
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社十二日讯：格里哥罗维奇在真理报撰文，嘲笑美国侵略者对比利时社会基督教党党员、前比利时国防部长梅兰志愿参加朝鲜美国侵略军所作的喝采。他写道：美国侵略者在朝鲜进行血腥的冒险的失败，使他们天天都感到危险，迫使他们对他们的仆从国增加压力，愈益着急地强迫仆从国派遣地面部队去拯救麦克阿瑟。然而，在马歇尔化各国和美国，征召志愿兵的运动都彻底失败了。例如，加斯贝利、谢尔巴及罗马的其他金元仆从们竭尽全力为麦克阿瑟征召“志愿兵”的努力，是大家都知道的。但是，这些努力的唯一结果，是意大利为斯德哥尔摩宣言征集的签名在最近几周内增加了许多倍。在澳大利亚、荷兰和其他国家，也正在发生同样的事情。华盛顿的政客们知道，甚至美国人也不愿为摩根及洛克菲勒家族的利益而到朝鲜去送死。
    自从朝鲜战事发生以来；美国结婚的人数即突然增多，因为，到现在为止，家长还没有被召入伍。不管他们的这些努力，有关当局仍在绝望地叫喊着召募“志愿兵”。
    作者讽刺地写道：“正在这个时候，出现了一个失业的梅兰骑士，他终于找到了他对外国老区表示忠诚的机会。华盛顿方面决定把这个废料拿来进行宣传。部长志愿兵的确是个新奇的东西。喜不自胜的美国之音显然要替他大肆喧嚣，直到声嘶力竭为止”。
