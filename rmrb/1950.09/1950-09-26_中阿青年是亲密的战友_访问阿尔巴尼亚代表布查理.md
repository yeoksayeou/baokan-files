Visiting the World Federation of Democratic Youth Representatives

    Sino-Albanian Youth are Close Comrades-in-Arms
    Interview with Albanian Representative Buchali
    On the first afternoon of the arrival of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation in Beijing, we visited Comrade Buchali, the youth representative from one of the Eastern European People's Democracies – the People's Republic of Albania. He began by introducing Albania’s geographical situation, saying: Albania is a country in the Balkan Peninsula, close to the Adriatic Sea, with an area of about 28,500 square kilometers and a population of 1.2 million.
    We asked him to describe the heroic struggles of the people in their country, and the contributions and achievements of the youth in the recovery and reconstruction. He said:
    Since November 29, 1944, when the Soviet Red Army drove the German and Italian fascist troops from Albanian territory, the Albanian people established the People's Republic on January 11, 1946. Under the leadership of the Workers' Party, they are enthusiastically building a democratic and free new motherland.
    In the struggle for national independence and the construction of the motherland, the youth, under the leadership of the Workers' Party, have a heroic history.
    The Albanian Workers' Party was officially established on November 8, 1941, and the Communist Youth League was also established, becoming the vanguard of Albanian youth organizations. In order to further mobilize the broad masses of Albanian youth to participate in the anti-fascist struggle, the Central Committee of the Workers' Party decided in April 1942 to establish the Anti-Fascist Youth League, uniting youth from all walks of life, with different political views and different religions, to participate in guerrilla warfare and conduct underground struggles in the fascist-occupied areas. At that time, a total of 70,000 people participated in the war of liberation, of which young men and women accounted for 70 percent. On September 15, 1949, a unified congress of youth organizations was held in the city of Shkodra, establishing the Albanian Labor Youth League.
    After liberation, Albanian youth plunged into the wave of construction, and all youth participated in construction work. Now, they are striving to build a 43-kilometer railway from Elbasan to Peqin to welcome the anniversary of the Soviet Socialist Revolution on November 7 this year.
    The young People's Republic of Albania has also made great achievements in education. During the imperial era, Albania had only 50,000 students, and illiteracy accounted for 80 percent of the national population. Now there are 200,000 students nationwide, and only 20 percent are illiterate. 70,000 young people have joined the Labor Youth League, and they are very clear that they are fighting for peace, democracy, and future happiness. Today, all the young people of Albania have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal.
    When he talked about his impression of our country, he said: The youth of Albania have always respected the youth of our country who participated in the liberation war. He is the first Albanian youth to come to China and hopes to write a booklet about China after returning home, so that the Albanian youth can learn more about the victorious Chinese people, especially the youth. He also emphasized: "Chinese youth and Albanian youth are close friends; China's victory is Albania's victory, and our future is the same." (Attached picture)

    中阿青年是亲密的战友
    访问阿尔巴尼亚代表布查理
    在世界民主青年联盟代表团到达北京的第一天下午，我们访问了东欧人民民主国家之一——阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国青年代表布查理同志。他首先介绍了阿尔巴尼亚的地理情况说：阿尔巴尼亚是在巴尔干半岛靠近亚得里亚海的国家，面积约两万八千五百平方公里，人口一百二十万。
    我们要求他介绍一些关于他们国内人民英勇斗争的情况，和青年们在恢复和建设中的贡献和成就。他说：
    自一九四四年十一月二十九日，苏联红军从阿尔巴尼亚的国土上赶走德意法西斯的军队后，阿尔巴尼亚人民在一九四六年一月十一日成立了人民共和国。在工人党的领导下热忱地建设民主、自由的新的祖国。
    在争取民族独立的斗争和祖国的建设的工作中，青年在工人党的领导下，有着英勇的历史。
    阿尔巴尼亚工人党在一九四一年十一月八日正式成立，共产主义青年联盟也随之成立，成为阿尔巴尼亚青年组织的先锋队。为了进一步动员阿尔巴尼亚广大青年群众参加反法西斯斗争，一九四二年四月，工人党中央委员会决定建立反法西斯青年联盟，团结各阶层、各种不同政治见解与不同宗教的青年参加游击战争，并在法西斯占领区进行地下斗争。当时参加解放战争的共有七万人，其中青年男女占百分之七十。一九四九年九月十五日在希高特拉城举行了青年组织统一代表大会，成立阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟。
    解放后，阿尔巴尼亚青年卷入了建设的浪潮，青年都参加了建设工作。现在，他们正争取建筑一条从爱尔巴桑到培根长四十三公里的铁路来迎接今年的十一月七日苏联社会主义革命纪念日。
    年轻的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，在教育方面也有了很大的成就。在帝制时代，阿尔巴尼亚仅有学生五万人，文盲占全国人数的百分之八十。现在全国已有二十万名学生，文盲只有百分之二十了。七万名青年加入了劳动青年联盟，他们都很清楚的知道他们是为和平、民主、和将来的幸福而斗争。今天阿尔巴尼亚的全体青年们都在斯德哥尔摩和平呼吁书上签了名。
    当他说到对我国的印象时，他说：阿尔巴尼亚的青年们对我国参加解放战争的青年一向是非常尊重的。他是阿尔巴尼亚青年到中国来的第一个人，希望回国后能写一本关于中国的小册子，使阿尔巴尼亚的青年们能更多了解胜利的中国人民，尤其是青年的情况。他并强调的说：“中国青年和阿尔巴尼亚青年是亲密的朋友；中国的胜利就是阿尔巴尼亚的胜利，我们的前途是一致的。”（附图片）
