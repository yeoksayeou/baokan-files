　　Xinhua News Agency, 31st: Washington News: Under the request of US President Truman, the US Congress has passed the 1950-51 budget案, which will further drive the United States towards a war economy. The House and Senate first passed the regular appropriation bill totaling $36,155,350,000 on the 25th and 28th respectively. This bill was signed into effect by Truman on the day it was passed by the Senate. Subsequently, the House passed an additional military expenditure appropriation bill of $16,771,100,000 proposed by Truman after the United States provoked the Korean War, on the 26th. This bill will be discussed and passed in the Senate within days.

　　The first appropriation above was proposed by Truman at the beginning of the year. Before its passage by both houses, a joint conference committee of the two houses decided to generally reduce non-direct military expenditures by one-fifth, while increasing direct military expenditures in the budget to more than $15 billion. Therefore, in the aforementioned post-war unprecedentedly large US budget案, which will total $53 billion, direct military expenditures alone will be nearly $32 billion, more than double the previous year and $10 billion more than the military expenditure in the second year (1942) after the United States entered World War II. Moreover, indirect military expenditures in the remaining part of the budget, such as the development of atomic energy and appropriations for the Marshall Plan also used for aggression, account for a large proportion. Thus, the funds actually used for the national economy are negligible. Therefore, the new budget案 has fully proven to be a war budget.

　　The aggressiveness of the new budget案 is also manifested in the use of so-called "non-military expenditures." According to the now-passed regular appropriation bill, the third-year appropriation for the Marshall Plan is $2,527,000,000. Congress stipulates that Marshall Plan countries must contribute to the US war of aggression in order to obtain this appropriation. Congress also authorized Truman not to provide loans to any Marshall Plan country that he believes refuses or neglects to support the United States with armed personnel, war materials, or labor.

　　In addition, the new budget案 also increased a $62.5 million loan to fascist Spain. During the House debate on the above loan, Labor Party Representative Marcantonio vehemently opposed it, pointing out that the supporters of this loan were attempting to use the pretext of containing communism to shield fascism.

　　According to US Democratic Representative Mahon, who revealed in the House on the 25th, Truman intends to request Congress for an additional $10 billion in military spending for this year soon, which will bring the total direct military spending to over $40 billion.

### 美国会通过本年度预算案  直接军事费用达三百余亿  预算案的侵略性充分暴露

　　美国会通过本年度预算案
    直接军事费用达三百余亿
    预算案的侵略性充分暴露
    【新华社三十一日讯】华盛顿消息：在美国总统杜鲁门要求下，美国国会已通过使美国进一步走上战争经济的一九五○——五一年度预算案。众院与参院先在二十五日及二十八日先后通过了总额达三百六十一亿五千三百五十万美元的经常拨款法案，这一法案于参院通过当日即已由杜鲁门签署施行。接着众院又于二十六日通过了杜鲁门于美国挑起朝鲜战争之后提出的一百六十七亿七千一百万美元的额外军事费用拨款法案，这一法案日内即将在参院讨论通过。
    上面的第一项拨款，系杜鲁门于年初提出，在这次两院通过前，曾经两院联席会议委员会决定，普遍削减其中非直接军事性费用五分之一，而将预算中的直接军事费用增加到一百五十多亿美元。因此，在上两项合计将达五百三十亿美元的美国战后空前庞大的预算案中，仅直接军事费用即将近三百二十亿美元，较上年度增加一倍以上，较美国参加第二次世界大战后第二年（一九四二年）的军费尚多一百亿美元。而预算其余部分中的如发展原子能以及同样用于侵略的马歇尔计划拨款等项间接军事费用，也占着很大比重。这样，实际上用于国民经济的款项已微不足道。因此，上项新预算已充分证明是一个战争预算。
    新预算案的侵略性还表现在所谓“非军事费用”的用途上。按照现在通过的经常拨款法案，马歇尔计划第三年的拨款为二十五亿二千七百万美元。国会规定马歇尔化国家要取得这项拨款，必须为美国的侵略战争出力。国会并授权杜鲁门对于他认为拒绝或怠忽以武装人员、战争物资或劳务支持美国的任何马歇尔化国家，得不予贷款。
    此外，新预算中还增加了一项六千二百五十万美元的对法西斯西班牙的贷款。在众院辩论上项贷款时，劳工党众议员马肯托尼奥曾激烈反对，指出这一贷款的支持者企图假遏止共产主义作为庇护法西斯主义的口实。
    据美国民主党众议员马洪二十五日在众院透露，杜鲁门打算不久还要向国会要求再增拨本年度军费一百亿美元，这将使直接军事费总数高达四百亿以上。
