Why do American Imperialists call my Taiwan "Formosa"?
To the Editor:
	The newspapers report that American imperialists are stubbornly calling our Taiwan "Formosa" in the United Nations Security Council. What is the reason for this? Please explain.
	Li Keming

Comrade Li Keming:
	"Formosa" is originally a historical term. In the 16th century, when the Portuguese invaded Taiwan, they saw the beautiful scenery of the island and called Taiwan "Formosa," meaning "Beautiful Island." Now, the intention of the American imperialists to use this name to replace "Taiwan" is clear: it is to not recognize "Taiwan" as a Chinese place name.
	This shows that the American imperialists are not only robbers, but also hooligans and rascals!
	A hooligan steals someone else's property but refuses to admit that he is a robber. He shamelessly says to the victim who accuses him of robbery: "Is this thing yours? You call out to it and see if it answers!"
	However, the people of Taiwan love the motherland, so the American hooligan says: "What I robbed was Formosa, not Taiwan!"
	We should tell the American imperialists: The Chinese people know how to deal with robbers and hooligans. The Japanese robbers called China "Shina" instead of "China," but what was the result? "China" was not abolished because of this, but rather the complete destruction of the robbers and aggressors!

### 为什么美帝国主义者称我台湾为福摩萨？

　　为什么美帝国主义者称我台湾为福摩萨？编者同志：
    报载美帝国主义在联合国安全理事会硬称我们的台湾为福摩萨，这是什么道理？请你们解答。
    李克明李克明同志：
    福摩萨原是一个历史上的名词。十六世纪葡萄牙人侵入我台湾，因见此岛山水秀丽，即称台湾为福摩萨（Formosa），意即“美丽之岛”。现在美帝国主义者要用这个名称来代替台湾，用意是清楚的：就是不承认“台湾”这个中国地名。
    这说明了美帝不但是强盗，而且是流氓、无赖！
    流氓抢了别人的物件，却不承认自己是强盗。他会厚颜无耻地对控告他抢劫的失主说：“这东西是你的吗？你喊一声看，看它会不会应！”
    然而台湾人民是热爱祖国的，于是美国流氓说道：“我抢的是福摩萨，而不是台湾！”
    我们应该告诉美帝国主义：中国人民是懂得如何对付强盗和流氓的。日本强盗称中国为“支那”，不称“中国”，但是结果是什么呢？“中国”并没有因此取消，而是抢劫和侵略者的彻底灭亡！
