　　Cotton Growing Expert Tong Xiangchen
　　His Cotton Field: Good Seedlings are Over Three Feet Tall, Each Plant Bears Thirty-Two Cotton Bolls, Average Yield of 214 Jin of Seed Cotton Per Mu.
　　Cotton growing model Tong Xiangchen lives in Tubaozi Village, Seventh District, Yixian County, Western Liaoning Province, Northeast China. The mutual aid group he leads is a model cotton growing mutual aid group in the whole county, and Tubaozi Village is a model cotton growing village in the whole county. Therefore, people call him "Cotton Growing Expert Tong Xiangchen."
　　Successful Trial Planting of Cotton in Mountainous and Low-Lying Areas
　　In the spring of 1949, the government called for a large-scale development of cotton fields. The villagers were afraid of suffering losses and paying more public grain, and said, "Tubaozi Village is mostly mountainous and low-lying, and it is not suitable for growing cotton." At that time, Lao Tong believed the government's words and first planted 14 mu of cotton in his own two low-lying plots. Affected by Lao Tong, the households in the group planted 16 mu, and the whole village also planted 37.5 mu of cotton. Because he cultivated well, his 14 mu of cotton harvested 3,000 jin of seed cotton, with an average yield of 2,140 jin of seed cotton per hectare, which was 1,140 jin of seed cotton more than ordinary cotton fields. His best cotton was three feet two inches tall, bearing thirty-two cotton bolls, and the general average was also above fifteen cotton bolls (others grew only one or two feet tall, bearing four or five cotton bolls). This was the first successful experiment. After returning from the provincial labor model conference this year, he first publicized the government's policy of rewarding cotton planting at the district people's representative meeting, calling on everyone to grow more cotton. After returning to the village, Lao Tong planted 22 mu of cotton on his own 24 mu of land. Others said that cotton could not be grown on mountain slopes, but Lao Tong also tried to plant it this year, and the cotton seedlings grew four inches taller than ordinary cotton seedlings, and many cotton bolls were also produced. Lao Tong's experience is: as long as you sow in a timely manner and tend to it diligently, cotton can be grown in both mountainous and low-lying areas. Under the influence of Lao Tong's growing more cotton, the whole village planted 220 mu this year, accounting for 73 percent of the total cultivated area.
　　"It's all thanks to Lao Tong's good guidance!"
　　This spring, the government called for removing "newly sprouted buds," but the masses were not accustomed to this. Lao Tong first removed the buds from his own 22 mu of cotton fields, and the masses in the whole village followed suit and removed the buds from 60 percent of the land. Lao Tong's technical guidance was often introduced to everyone in the form of meetings. When insect pests were first discovered, the masses were not in a hurry and were afraid of spending money on spraying medicine. He first sprayed his own land twice with "rotenone powder" and once with lime-sulfur mixture, promptly eliminating the insect pests. He used his own practical examples to calculate the details for the villagers, proposing to save as many plants as possible; then he explained when to spray, what medicine to spray, and how to spray it. This triggered a wave of spraying medicine, and the whole village generally sprayed twice, with some spraying up to four times, ensuring that the cotton fields were not damaged by insect pests. Lao Tong's methods of tending cotton are not only timely but also meticulous. The cotton seeds he plants are all purebred seeds selected from the best plants of the previous year. When sowing, he applies 360 piles of manure per hectare, 300 jin per pile, and also applies topdressing fertilizer (ammonium sulfate) of 100 jin during the weeding. In addition to removing newly sprouted buds, he can do five weedings and four hoeings to ensure that there are no weeds in the field. When the cotton grows to more than one foot tall, he often leads his seven able-bodied family members to the field to top, pinch and remove dense leaves. He also holds meetings in the group to discuss which plots have not been topped, how to top them, and why to remove dense leaves, etc. Under his promotion, most of the cotton fields in their group have completed five weedings and four hoeings, and the whole village has done four weedings and four hoeings. Now the seedlings are an average of one and a half feet tall, with five to seven cotton bolls per plant. It is estimated that the whole village can produce 1,600 jin of seed cotton per hectare, an increase of 600 jin per hectare compared to last year. The villagers all say, "It's all thanks to Lao Tong's good guidance!"
　　Last year, Tong Xiangchen's family produced 6,000 jin of cotton, which was exchanged for 40 shi of grain, equivalent to the harvest of eight hectares of large fields. In addition to paying public grain, he also bought a large cart and two donkeys, and still has surplus grain. Lao Tong said, "We have been liberated. As long as we produce well and grow more cotton, our lives will definitely get better and better!" This autumn, he will not only select seeds from his own plants, but also lead the whole village to ensure that the whole village will completely plant purebred "Guannong No. 1" next year. He also plans to turn all 24 mu of his land into cotton fields.

　　植棉能手佟相臣
    他的棉田：好苗高三尺多，每棵结桃三十二个，平均每亩产籽棉二百一十四斤。
    植棉模范佟相臣，家住东北辽西省义县七区土堡子村。他领导的互助组是全县植棉模范互助组，土堡子村又是全县植棉模范村。所以人们叫他“植棉能手佟相臣”。
  山洼地试种棉花成功
    一九四九年春天，政府号召大量发展棉田。老乡们怕吃亏、怕多纳公粮，又说：“土堡子村多是山地和洼地，不适合种棉。”当时，老佟相信政府的话，先在自家二洼地种上了十四亩棉花。小组各户受了老佟影响，种了十六亩，全村也多种了三十七亩五分棉花。因为他耕作得好，他的十四亩棉花收三千斤籽棉，平均每垧产二千一百四十斤籽棉，比一般棉田多收一千一百四十斤籽棉。他最好的棉花有三尺二寸高，结三十二个桃，一般平均也在十五个桃以上（别人种的只长一、二尺高，结四、五个桃），这是第一次试验成功。今年他由省劳模会回去以后，首先在区人民代表会上宣传了政府奖励植棉的政策，号召大家多多种棉花。回村后，老佟又在自己二十四亩土地上种了二十二亩棉花。别人说山坡地种不了，老佟今年也试着种上，结果棉苗长的比一般棉苗还高四寸，桃也结的很多。老佟的经验是：只要适期播种及时侍弄，不论山地、洼地都能种。在老佟多种棉花的影响下，今年全村种了二百二十亩，占总耕地面积的百分之七十三。
  “都靠咱老佟指导得好啊！”
    今年春天，政府号召铲“萌生”，群众没有这个习惯，老佟先把自己的二十二亩棉田铲了一遍，全村群众跟着也铲了百分之六十的地。老佟的技术指导常常是用开会方式介绍给大家的。在虫灾刚一发现时，群众都不着忙，还怕打药水花钱。他先在自己地上打两遍“鱼藤粉”和一遍石灰硫黄合剂药水，及时地消灭了虫害。他用自己的实际例子给老乡们算细账，提出能救活一棵是一棵；然后又讲什么时候打，打什么药，怎样打法。从而掀起了打药热潮，全村普遍打了两遍，最多有打四遍的，保住了棉田未遭虫害。老佟在侍弄棉花的方法上，不但及时而且能做到精细。他种的棉花种籽都是头年棵选的纯种。播种时每垧地上三百六十堆粪。每堆三百斤，铲趟中还上追肥（硫胺）一百斤。除铲萌生外，他能作到五铲四趟，保证地里没草。在棉花长到一尺多高时，他常领着家里七个能干活的人，全部下地打尖、摘密叶。并在小组开会研究那块地没打尖？怎样打法？为什么要摘掉密叶等等。在他推动下，他们这组棉田大都完成了五铲四趟，全村做到四铲四趟。现在苗高平均一尺五，每棵结桃五个到七个。估计全村每垧可产一千六百斤籽棉，比去年每垧可增产六百斤。老乡们都说：“都靠咱老佟指导得好啊！”
    佟相臣家去年产棉六千斤，换粮四十石，顶八垧大田的收成。他除交公粮外，还买一辆大车，两头驴，现在还有余粮。老佟说：“咱们翻了身，只要好好生产，多种棉花，生活定会一天天好起来！”今秋他不但要自己棵选种籽，还要带起全村，保证明年全村完全种上纯种的“关农一号”。并计划将自己家二十四亩地，全部种成棉花。
