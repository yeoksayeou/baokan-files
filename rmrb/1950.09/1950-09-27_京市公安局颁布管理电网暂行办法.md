　　Beijing Public Security Bureau Issues Provisional Measures for the Management of Electrical Grids

　　To ensure the safety of citizens, the Beijing Public Security Bureau has recently promulgated the "Provisional Measures of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau for the Management of Electrical Grids." The measures clearly stipulate that all public and private institutions and organizations that install electrical grids within the city's jurisdiction must submit a written application to their respective Public Security Sub-bureaus for registration, await personnel to conduct inspections, and finally be reviewed and approved by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Institutions and organizations installing new electrical grids must register before installation and can only begin construction after approval. The area where the electrical grid is installed should have wooden signs with the words "Danger: Electricity" hung around its perimeter. Red warning lights should be installed on the support poles of the electrical grid at appropriate intervals to facilitate nighttime identification. Electrical grids must not be installed on walls lower than two and a half meters. A protective moat should be dug around ground-level electrical grids, with a minimum distance of one meter between the grid and the moat. At the same time, the measures also regulate the use of voltage, stipulating that it shall not exceed 500 volts in urban areas and shall not exceed 3,300 volts in suburban areas. The measures also clearly stipulate the discharge time of the electrical grid. The measures finally stipulate that all Public Security Sub-bureaus and police stations may inspect the premises where electrical grids are installed at any time, and those who violate the regulations shall be ordered to immediately modify or dismantle them. If a citizen is injured or killed due to violations, the installer shall bear legal responsibility.
