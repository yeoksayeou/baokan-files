    On the Eve of National Day, a Letter to Chairman Mao Reporting Production Achievements
　　All Workers of Qingdao Sifang Railway Factory
    Rush to Complete the "National Day" New Locomotive
    Scheduled to Arrive in Beijing Today to Dedicate to Chairman Mao
    [This newspaper reports] Comprehensive News: All workers of the Qingdao Sifang Railway Factory rushed to manufacture a new locomotive before National Day and decided to strive to complete the annual production task in November to celebrate the first National Day of the People's Republic of China after its founding, and use the new locomotive as a gift from the factory workers to Chairman Mao. The new locomotive was carefully manufactured under the unprecedentedly enthusiastic emotions of all workers in the factory, and it was completed on the 15th of this month, and the official trial run on the 22nd was successful. This locomotive is the first newly manufactured locomotive within the customs after the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was named "National Day" by Minister of Railways Teng Daiyuan and is scheduled to arrive in Beijing on the 29th to be dedicated to Chairman Mao as a gift for National Day. Minister Teng will accept the gift on behalf of Chairman Mao at that time.
    After the new locomotive was completed on September 15, all the workers in the factory also wrote a letter to report to Chairman Mao. The original letter is as follows:
Dear Chairman Mao:
    October 1st is coming soon! All of us workers have been looking forward to this day for a long time, because it is the first birthday of our People's Republic of China, which is the happiest and most joyful day for us workers.
    Dear Chairman Mao: Under your leadership, our new country, our own new government, has not only defeated the Chiang Kai-shek scum militarily and driven them into the sea, but also won an economic victory, stabilizing prices across the country and improving our lives.
    Chairman Mao: Didn't you say that we should strive to fundamentally improve the national economic situation in about three years? We must work hard to do this; now our factory has decided to complete the annual production task in November and produce more things to build our new country.
    Chairman Mao: There are nearly three thousand workers in our factory. Among these nearly three thousand workers, many have been working for thirty or forty years. We have been subjected to the rule of Japanese devils twice and the rule of Kuomintang reactionaries twice in this factory. We were beaten, scolded, treated as beasts of burden, and could not even get enough to eat.
    Dear Chairman Mao: We report to you that since our liberation, since the founding of our People's Republic of China, we workers have really changed! We have truly become the masters of the country; everyone is contributing their strength to build their own country. Production has become everyone's own business!
    Chairman Mao: Celebrating the country's first birthday is a major event. All of us workers have long thought: How should we workers express our feelings? We have already made a plan! In August, all the employees of our factory held an employee representative conference. At this meeting, we decided to make a brand new locomotive to dedicate to you as a birthday gift from all of us workers to our People's Republic of China; we guarantee that this gift will be of good quality and beautiful. Now we report to you: this new locomotive has been completed!
    We wish you good health forever!
    Respectfully yours, All Workers of Sifang Railway Factory
          September 15

    国庆前夕上书毛主席报告生产成绩
　　青岛四方铁路工厂全体职工
    赶制完成“国庆号”新机车
    定今日开抵北京献给毛主席
    【本报讯】综合消息：青岛四方铁路工厂全体职工于国庆节前赶制新机车一台及决定争取在十一月份完成全年生产任务以庆祝中华人民共和国开国后的第一个国庆日，并以新机车作为该厂职工向毛主席的献礼。新机车在该厂全体职工空前热烈的情绪下精心制造，已于本月十五日落车，二十二日正式试运成绩良好。这台机车是中华人民共和国成立后关内第一台新制的机车，经铁道部滕代远部长命名为“国庆号”，定于二十九日开抵北京献给毛主席，作为国庆日的献礼。届时将由滕部长代表受礼。
    九月十五日新机车落车后，该厂全体工人并上书报告毛主席。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    十月一日快来到了！我们全体工人老早就盼着这个日子，因为这是我们中华人民共和国成立的第一个生日，也就是我们工人最高兴最快乐的日子。
    亲爱的毛主席：我们的新国家，我们自己的新政府在您的领导下，不但在军事上把蒋介石败类赶到了海里去，还在经济上打了胜仗，使全国的物价稳定，使我们的生活改善了。
    毛主席：您不是说要在三年左右争取全国经济状况的基本好转吗？我们一定努力这样作；现在我们的厂子里已经决定在十一月份完成全年的生产任务，多生产东西来建设我们的新国家。
    毛主席：我们厂子里有将近三千工人同志，这将近三千工人中，有不少干了三四十年的老工人，我们在这厂里两度经受了日本鬼子的统治和两度国民党反动派的统治，挨打挨骂，当牛当马，一天不得一饱。
    亲爱的毛主席：我们向您报告，自从我们解放以后，自从我们的中华人民共和国成立以后，我们工人真是大变了样啊！我们真正当了国家的主人；每个人都为建设自己的国家而供献出自己的力量。生产已经变成了我们每个人自己的事了！
    毛主席：庆祝国家第一个生日这是件大事，我们全体工人老早就想：我们工人应该怎样表表自己的心呢？这个，我们早就打好谱啦！在八月里我们全厂职工开了个职工代表大会，在这个会议上，我们决定要制一台全新的机车献给您，作为我们全体工人给我们中华人民共和国做生日的礼物；这件礼物，我们保证做的质量好又漂亮。现在我们向您报告：这台新机车已经落成了！
    祝您身体永远健康！
    四方铁路工厂全体工人敬启
          九月十五日
