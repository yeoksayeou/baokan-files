　　Northeast China and Beijing Electrical Workers Pledge to Complete Tasks
    Support Foreign Minister Zhou's Protest Against the U.S.
    [This Newspaper's Report] Electrical workers in various regions are resolutely protesting against the atrocities of American imperialism. Staff members of various sections and substations of the Northeast China Electric Power Bureau held discussions one after another to protest the atrocities of American planes. Workers at the Xiaodong, Shengli, Quangong and other substations unanimously expressed that they will intensify inspections to protect machinery from any failures, ensure safe power delivery, and heighten vigilance against spies and air raids. The Northeast Regional Committee of the Electrical Workers' Union, representing all electrical workers in Northeast China, wrote letters to Foreign Minister Zhou and the China Peace Committee, expressing their support for Foreign Minister Zhou's protest by ensuring power supply for industrial and mining enterprises and rapidly restoring and developing China's industry.
    All staff members of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau issued a protest statement on September 1st, stating: "On August 27th, American imperialist planes invaded our Northeast China's airspace five times in a row, killing and injuring our worker brothers. This shameless behavior has aroused the anger of people all over the world. American imperialist planes dared to invade our Northeast China's airspace again on the 29th and shoot our compatriots. This is something we can never tolerate. All of us unanimously support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest and resolutely guarantee to complete production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfill quotas, and prepare our strength to strike at American imperialism."
