　　The Chinese Working Class – The Vanguard of Anti-Aggression (Part 2)
    ——A Comprehensive Report from This Publication
  Passenger Signature Campaign
    Workers from various regions and industries, in addition to enthusiastically participating in the peace signature campaign themselves, also extended the signature campaign to the broad masses of the people. Many railway, postal and telecommunications, shop employee, and municipal workers combined their specific duties and created various forms to carry out the propaganda and mobilization work for peace signatures. From Northeast to Southwest, railway workers in various regions launched extensive passenger signature campaigns. For example, Zhang Zhonghou, a model member of the Communist Youth League in the Qiqihar Train Section, led the members of his chartered car group in actively publicizing to passengers through slogans, spoken slogans, broadcasting, and individual explanations. By the end of June, they had collected signatures from 13,000 passengers. Conductors of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau's Zhengzhou Transport Section universally launched a peace signature campaign on passenger trains, using passenger rest time to report major domestic and international events to passengers through loudspeakers, and promote the significance of the peace signature campaign; they used two people to hold up the red cloth for signatures and personally walked to passengers' seats with pens to facilitate passenger signatures. People signed very enthusiastically. On some trains, all passengers signed their names. Many passengers could not wait for the signature cloth to come to them and rushed up to request signatures. Women on children's cars also squeezed forward to sign while holding their children.
    Workers at the Yichang Post Office in Jiangxi Province used a large stamp engraved with "People who love peace, enthusiastically sign the peace book" on every envelope. The six members of the Guangfeng County Postal Workers' Union group used the opportunity of postal delivery to the countryside to promote and mobilize peasants in various townships to sign. Under their influence, 685 peasants immediately signed. The Tianjin Municipal Postal and Telecommunications Union has been cooperating with mobile postal vehicles for days to expand publicity to citizens. The postal vehicles are equipped with loudspeakers, and peace signature books and comics are posted on them, along with propaganda stamps. During Shanghai’s Peace Signature Campaign Week, the Shanghai Shop Employees' Union mobilized a total of 150,000 citizens to sign. Deliverymen from the Qingdao Salt Industry Company and Grain Company carried signature books with them at all times and seized any free time to conduct propaganda. A young worker in the Western food service industry placed the signature book on the table while serving guests and promoting signatures. The Shanghai Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s Yangtze River liners, Jianghan, Jiang’an, and Jianghua, were decorated with large red cloth banners and red cloth tables in the main dining rooms when sailing to Hankou, so that passengers could sign the peace book. Employees of the business section of the Huadian Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union of Municipal Workers printed red stamps with "Oppose aggressive war, defend world peace" on every bill envelope sent to users. Employees of the meter reading team promoted peace signatures to users when reading meters, and employees of the payment collection team called on users paying electricity bills to sign. The Shanghai Gas Company Branch also attached a peace signature book to the bills of each user. After consultation with the administration of the Telephone Company Branch, four operators were specially assigned to ask users with phone numbers beginning with "2": "Have you signed the peace book?" "Please mobilize your relatives and friends to sign the peace book." The other five automatic exchanges also conducted propaganda when testing lines for users. In addition, there was a dedicated phone number, "94100," staffed to answer questions about peace signatures.
  Mobilizing Citizens to Sign on the Streets
    Many workers in various regions who worked hard in factories spared time during their holidays or after work, under the principle of not affecting production, to go to the streets to mobilize citizens to participate in peace signatures. The street propaganda work of Shanghai’s workers was particularly active. For example, a signature table was set up at the entrance of China Textile Factory No. 12, and the workers were busy drawing cartoons and posting them at the entrance for propaganda. The workers in charge of broadcasting even shouted themselves hoarse. On July 5th, the team from the Clothing Industry Union set out. In the morning, they held a masquerade parade on Nanjing Road, playing the roles of Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, Quirino, and Yoshida, and in the afternoon, they went to the factory area to conduct propaganda. The Communist Youth League of the People's Printing Factory dispatched 133 people, divided into 16 small teams, to propagate the significance of the signature to the masses. The masses welcomed them very much. Some people sent boiled water to the propagandists to quench their thirst, and some sent sugar cane. Many people signed. The workers of the barbershop signed their names and also asked customers to sign. Even when it rained, the propaganda team continued to advance and publicize. When they returned to the factory, they calculated that they had signed a total of 3,295 people. Members of the trishaw union mobilized citizens to sign in the streets, alleys, and railway stations every day. By July 7th, they had mobilized more than 100,000 people to sign. Workers from the Dazhong Industrial Cooperative took a megaphone to the nearby vegetable market early in the morning to mobilize signatures. On July 6th, students from the unemployed workers' training class of the Chongxin Yarn Factory continued to collect signatures in the suburbs. A vendor named Lü Youcai, who was holding a three-year-old child, sadly wrote his name and held the child's hand, saying: "Baby, write your name in the peace book too. Your mother was killed by the American-Chiang bandit plane on May 2nd. When you grow up, never forget this hatred!" He finally spent a lot of effort, with red eyes, holding the child's hand, and crookedly wrote the three characters Lü Xiaofu.
  Going to the Countryside to Conduct Propaganda
    Many workers in Shanghai, Yichang, and other places also went to the countryside specifically for propaganda, and each time they were warmly welcomed by the peasants. When they left, the peasants sent them off and said: "Come to the countryside more often when things like this happen in the future." Workers at the Yichang Cigarette Factory found that the peasants were harvesting wheat and it was inconvenient to publicize. They helped the peasant brothers harvest wheat while conducting propaganda. The peasants were extremely moved, and more than 200 people signed their names automatically at that time.
    The family members of the workers are the basic masses for the workers to mobilize signatures. The vast majority of workers across the country have successfully completed the task of mobilizing their family members to sign.
    After the American imperialist aircraft strafed the people of Andong in our country on August 27th, an act of armed provocation, it aroused greater anger from the working class. Standing at the forefront of the Chinese people in defending world peace, the Chinese working class is determined to continue to actively expand the peace signature campaign and will respond to the atrocities of American imperialism with practical actions to further increase production.

　　中国工人阶级——反侵略的先锋（下）
    ——本刊综合报道
  乘客签名运动
    各地各产业的职工们，除了本身踊跃参加和平签名以外，还把签名运动推展到广大的人民群众中去。许多铁路、邮电、店员、市政的职工们，都结合着自己的具体业务，创造了各种形式进行着和平签名的宣传动员工作。从东北到西南，各地的铁路工人发动了广泛的乘客签名运动，如齐齐哈尔列车段的模范团员张忠厚领导的包车组组员们用标语、口号、广播、个别讲解等方式，积极地对乘客进行宣传。他们在六月底已征集了一万三千名乘客签名。郑州铁路局郑州车务段乘务员在各次乘客列车上普遍展开和平签名运动，利用乘客休息时间，用喇叭筒向乘客报告国内外大事，宣传保卫和平签名运动的意义；用两人拉开签名的红布，拿了笔亲自走到乘客座位旁边，以便乘客签名。签名的人非常踊跃。有几趟车，全车旅客每人都签了名，有很多乘客等不到签中布拿到跟前，就抢着跑上去要求签名，儿童车上的妇女们怀抱着孩子，也都挤上去签名。
    江西宜昌邮局的职工们用刻有“爱好和平的人们，踊跃在和平书上签名”的大图章，盖在每一个信封上，广丰县邮政工会小组六人，利用邮运下乡的机会，宣传并动员各乡农民签名，在他们影响下立刻有六百八十五名农民签名。天津市邮电工会连日配合行动邮车向市民扩大宣传，邮车上装有扩音机，张贴和平签名书，漫画等，并备有宣传戳。上海店员工会在上海市和平签名运动周里，共计发动了十五万市民签名。青岛盐业公司，粮食公司的送货员，随时带着签名簿，抓紧空隙时间，进行宣传。西餐业某青年工人把签名簿摆在餐桌上，一面招待客人，一面宣传签名。上海招商局长江班江汉、江安，江华轮，在开航驶汉时，船上大菜间布置大红布标语，红布桌子，让旅客们在和平书上签名。上海市政工会华电分会营业科职工在每一个寄给用户的账单信封上加印“反对侵略战争，保卫世界和平”的红戳子，抄表股职工在抄表时向用户进行宣传和平签名工作，收金股的职工就号召缴电费的用户来签名。上海煤气公司分会给每家用户的账单也附了一张和平签名书，电话公司分会经与资方行政商量后，特地调动了四个接线员，向“二”字头电话用户询问：“你在和平书上签过名没有？”“请你发动亲友在和平书上签名”，其他五个局自动机间对用户试线时，也同样进行宣传工作。另外有一只“九四一○○”号电话，专人伺候着，解答有关和平签名的问题。
  上街动员市民签名
    各地在工厂里努力生产的许多工人们，在不影响生产的原则下，挤出休假日或是放工后的时间，上街头去动员市民们参加和平签名，尤其是上海的职工们，街头宣传工作展开得最为活跃。如中纺十二厂的门口搭起一个签名台，工友们忙着画漫画贴在门口宣传，担任广播的工友连声音也喊哑了。七月五日那天，衣着业工会的队伍出动了，上午在南京路化装游行，扮演蒋介石、李承晚、季里诺、吉田四贼，下午到工厂区进行宣传。人民印制一厂的青年团出动一百三十三人，分十六小队出发向群众宣传签名意义，群众很欢迎，有人送开水给宣传员解渴，也有送甘蔗的，签名的人多极了，理发店的工友自己签了名还叫顾客签名。天下雨了，宣传队还继续前进宣传，回到厂里一算，一共签了三二九五人。三轮车工会的会员们天天在街头、里弄、火车站等地发动市民签名，到七月七日为止，已发动了十万人以上签名。大中工业社工友们，大清早带了传话筒，到附近小菜场里去发动签名。崇信纱厂失业工人学习班的同学，七月六日继续到郊外去征集签名时，有一位抱着三岁小孩的小贩吕有才，悲痛地写上自己的名字，并握着小孩的小手说：“宝宝你也在和平书写个名字，你的母亲在五月二日被美蒋匪机炸死，你长大了可千万不要忘记这个仇恨呀！”他终于红着眼圈花了很大气力，握着孩子的小手，歪歪斜斜的写下了吕小福三字。
  下乡进行宣传
    上海宜昌等地还有不少职工特地下乡宣传的，每次都得到农民们热烈的欢迎，临走时送他们，还说：“以后遇上这样的事，多下乡来。”宜昌烟厂工人们发现农民们在割麦，一时不便宣传，便一面帮农民兄弟割麦，一面进行宣传，农民极受感动，当时自动签名的就达二百多人。
    职工的家属们，便是职工们动员签名的基本群众，全国各地绝大部分的职工，已胜利地完成了发动家属签名的任务。
    八月二十七日美帝飞机扫射我国安东人民的武装挑衅行为发生后，激起了工人阶级更大的愤怒，站在中国人民保卫世界和平最前线的中国工人阶级已决心继续积极的扩大和平签名运动，并将以进一步提高生产的实际行动来回答美帝的暴行。
