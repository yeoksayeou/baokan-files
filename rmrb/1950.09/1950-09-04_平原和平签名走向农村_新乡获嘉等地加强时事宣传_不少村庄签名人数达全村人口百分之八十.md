The Peace Signature Campaign in Pingyuan Province Moves Towards Rural Areas
Xinxiang, Huojia and Other Places Strengthen Current Affairs Propaganda
Signature Numbers in Many Villages Reach 80% of the Entire Village Population

[Report from this newspaper] According to the Pingyuan Daily, the peace signature campaign in Pingyuan Province is gradually penetrating the rural areas from the cities and towns, and is gradually expanding from organized masses to unorganized masses. According to incomplete statistics, to date, more than 500,000 people have signed the peace declaration. In cities where the signature work is better, such as Xinxiang City, the number of signatures has reached more than one-half of the total population; in counties where the signature work is better, such as Huojia County, the number of signatures has reached 57.5% of the total population of the county (more than 110,000 people); in better villages, such as Dongmeng Village in the Second District of Xinxiang County and Zexia Village in Lin County, the number of signatures has reached more than 90% of the total population.

The characteristic of the peace signature campaign in Pingyuan Province is to deepen this campaign into the vast rural areas.

Many rural areas have correctly recognized the importance of propaganda and education work for the masses when carrying out the peace signature campaign. First, they mobilized Party members, Youth League members, cadres at all levels, representatives at all levels, people's organizations, rural primary school teachers, and activists among the masses to become organized propaganda teams, such as the propaganda and mobilization groups and propaganda base points in Puyang Prefecture, and rural propagandists and propaganda associations in Anyang Prefecture. On the basis of this large-scale propaganda, current affairs education has been regularized. In some areas, such as Xinxiang, the leadership attaches importance to and accepts the demands of the masses, and regularly offers current affairs classes in people's schools and night schools, all of which have achieved good results.

Secondly, many areas have combined the peace signature work with the current central work. For example, the Fifth District of Xinxiang County closely combined the propaganda methods and content with production work and burden work. When the district arranged the signature work to the villages, it implemented the movement against American imperialist aggression by discussing the current increase in cotton and grain production and summarizing the burden work, and used current affairs lectures at the meeting to link up with commending model villages that actively produce and pay public grain quickly and well. The village level also proceeded according to this policy. For example, Zhao Di Village arranged this work through the work of formulating a production plan, so that increasing production, the summer levy work, and the anti-American imperialist aggression propaganda work were specifically combined. The masses' production enthusiasm and enthusiasm for paying public grain were therefore even higher. For example, the masses in Zhao Di Village said: "After signing, we must do a good job in production and immediately pay public grain to support the front line to defend our good times." As a result, the village paid off the public grain in only half a day. After current affairs education, the farmers in Langgongmiao Village in Xinxiang realized that American imperialism is a paper tiger and is not terrible. Someone said: "The United States can't even beat North Korea, it's a real bear!" After the masses generally recognized the importance of defending peace, more than 800 people signed in two days, reaching 80% of the total village population. Of the 300 people in Zhudi Village, 230 signed. Except for the children, almost all the adults signed.

In order to achieve the goal of winning 7.5 million people in the province to participate in the signature campaign, striving for a majority of citizens in each city, the vast number of farmers in the old liberated areas, and the organized farmers in the new liberated areas to sign the peace declaration, Pingyuan Province decided to give full play to the strength of all organizations, closely combine with the current central work, and make the greatest efforts to deepen the movement into the rural areas, and absorb the successful experiences of other regions, and, on the basis of the masses' conscious willingness, expand the peace signature movement universally in an organized and planned manner.

　　平原和平签名走向农村
    新乡获嘉等地加强时事宣传 
    不少村庄签名人数达全村人口百分之八十
    【本报讯】据平原日报消息：平原省和平签名运动，从城镇逐步深入农村，从有组织的群众逐渐扩展到无组织的群众。据不完全的统计，至目前止，已有五十万以上的人在和平宣言上签了名。城市签名工作较好者如新乡市，签名人数已达人口总数的二分之一以上；县城签名工作较好者如获嘉县，签名人数已占全县人口百分之五十七·五（十一万人以上）；较好的村庄，如新乡县二区东孟庄、林县泽下村，签名人数达到人口总数百分之九十以上。
    平原省的和平签名运动的特点，就是把这一运动深入到广大的农村中去。
    许多地方的农村在开展和平签名运动时，都正确地认识到对群众的宣传教育工作的重要，首先发动了各级党团员、干部，各级代表会和人民团体、农村小学教员以及群众中的积极分子，成为有组织的宣传队伍，如濮阳专区的宣传鼓动组、宣传基点，安阳专区的农村宣传员、宣联会等。在这一大规模的宣传基础上，把时事教育经常化起来。有些地区如新乡，领导上重视并接受群众的要求，并定期在民校、夜校上时事课，均收到良好的效果。
    其次，许多地区把和平签名工作与当前的中心工作结合起来，如新乡县第五区在宣传方法与内容上紧密结合着生产工作与负担工作。区向村布置签名工作时即以讨论当前棉粮增产与总结负担工作贯彻了反对美帝国主义侵略运动，并在会议上利用讲解时事而联系到表扬积极生产与缴纳公粮又快又好的模范村子。村级亦是按此方针进行。如赵堤村通过订生产计划的工作布置了这一工作，使增加生产与夏征工作和反美帝侵略宣传工作具体结合了起来。群众的生产情绪与缴纳公粮的热情因之更为高涨。如赵堤村的群众说：“签上名，更要搞好生产，马上缴上公粮，支援前线以保卫我们的好时光。”结果该村只半天时间公粮便缴齐了。新乡郎公庙村的农民在经过时事教育后，认识到美帝国主义是纸老虎，并不可怕。有人说：“美国连朝鲜都打不过，真熊包！”群众普遍地认识了保卫和平的重要性后，两天内便有八百多人签名，达全村人口百分之八十，朱堤全村三百人口中签名的达二百三十人。除下小孩，成年人几乎都签了名。
    平原省为了要达到争取全省七百五十万人参加签名运动，争取每个城市的多数市民、老区的广大农民和新区已有组织的农民在和平宣言上签名，决定发挥一切组织的力量，并密切结合当前中心工作，用最大的努力把运动深入到农村中去，并吸收其他地区成功的经验，在群众自觉自愿的基础上，有组织有计划地把和平签名运动普遍扩大。
