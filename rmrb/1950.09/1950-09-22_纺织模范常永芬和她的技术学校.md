　　Textile Model Chang Yongfen and Her Technical School
　　Chang Yongfen is a female worker at the No. 2 Silk Weaving Factory of the Yingkou-Zhaizi Sericulture Company in Liaodong Province. She is twenty years old this year, a new record creator, a model member of the Communist Youth League, and a glorious member of the Communist Party. She has seven years of work experience. Since coming to the state-owned factory from a private factory, she has been even more enthusiastic in production. She often remembers the suffering she endured when she was an apprentice at the age of thirteen, having to work on an empty stomach every day. She also often remembers that she is a member of the Communist Youth League. When she first arrived at the No. 2 Silk Weaving Factory, it was right when the factory was launching a new record movement, so she started to use her brain, diligently practiced thread joining, and was determined to create a new record. On November 10th of last year, she created a new record of joining 2,760 warp threads of 300-gauge silk in one minute and forty-nine seconds, saving two minutes and ten seconds of working time; she could save 129 hours per month, which could weave 657 yards of silk. At that time, the factory's quota was four minutes and eighteen seconds. The workers all used the method of splicing, with the fastest being three and a half minutes and the average being five or six hours. At the factory's award ceremony, Chang Yongfen said to everyone, "We should guarantee to Chairman Mao that we will maintain the glorious tradition of the working class. We must use all our strength, think of new methods, and create more and better new records. I will teach everyone the thread joining technology, we will improve quality and output, and strive to complete the factory's annual production tasks!" Everyone immediately responded to Chang Yongfen's call, learning her technology and striving to complete and exceed the production tasks.
　　On December 17th of last year, they signed their first apprenticeship contract. Chang Yongfen was the teacher, with six students (five female workers and one male worker). At that time, the Youth League branch leadership's understanding of technical learning being led by the administrative leadership was not clear enough. Therefore, some difficulties were encountered in the technical learning process. Take the frame used for learning thread joining as an example, the Youth League branch secretary ran around, sweating profusely, but did not solve the problem. The trade union director asked him, "What are you doing building a frame for?" He said, "Learning thread joining!" The trade union director then said, "The frame you made wouldn't even kill a mouse, and the wind could blow it away!" Because the frame was useless, they didn't learn very well. Thus, the apprenticeship contract did not play a significant role in the initial stage.
　　The provincial enterprise bureau leadership criticized the administration and trade union of the Yingkou-Zhaizi Sericulture Company at a symposium for not making efforts to promote new operating methods. The leaders of the Yingkou-Zhaizi Sericulture Company began to pay attention to this issue and held a symposium with the Chang Yongfen group to study the method of learning thread joining.
　　Chang Yongfen taught everyone technology very sincerely and patiently. For example, Liu Jinchen joined the slowest, so Chang Yongfen carefully guided him by the side. When she discovered that he was taking an extra step compared to others, she immediately corrected him. Chang Yongfen encouraged everyone with her high enthusiasm for teaching technology, which increased everyone's confidence in learning technology. Because there were not enough frames in the workshop, everyone needed to learn by exchanging labor and helping each other. Some workers had low silk weaving skills. When they exchanged work with others, they often wove first-class silk into second-class or third-class silk. Some had emotional problems because they damaged their own silk during the exchange of work. Some cried and said, "I will never exchange again. Although I practiced the technology by joining the threads for her, I also saved her time, but look at how she wove the silk! What to do!" Chang Yongfen often patiently educated such students. Most of the students were willing to earn less wages and insisted on technical learning. The administration and trade union also educated the workers in the silk weaving room and formally announced, "No matter who is exchanging work, they must pay attention to quality. Whoever weaves it badly is responsible!" In this way, the workers' enthusiasm for learning technology became even greater.
　　On "March 8th" Women's Day, the first test was held. Wang Shirong, Yan Shuyun, and Qu Kun exceeded the conditions stipulated in the contract; the other three workers also met the conditions stipulated in the contract when the test was held at the expiration of the contract. Chang Yongfen also improved her own skills in the process of teaching. It only took her one minute and twenty-nine seconds to join a 503-strand thread. Chang Yongfen achieved great success in teaching apprentices, but she modestly said, "This is mainly due to their own efforts. It is useless to just teach patiently if he does not learn with an open mind!"
　　At the end of the first phase of the apprenticeship contract, a symposium was held to summarize the experience of this stage of technical learning. In order to meet the requirements of more young workers to learn thread joining technology, the second phase of the apprenticeship contract was signed on April 18th, with 56 workers (23 male workers and 23 female workers) participating in the study. The six students who graduated in the first phase also became teachers. The leadership gave it the name "Chang Yongfen Technical School." This time, the learning conditions were much better than the previous phase; the wooden frames met the standards, and a meeting system was established to regularly discuss and solve the difficulties in learning. Qu Guiying, Xu Rong, and Jiang Guixiang had already graduated 45 days early.
　　Now, the workers of the No. 2 Silk Weaving Factory have set off a wave of learning technology. Some workers do not leave after get off work in order to learn technology. Now, 85% of the workers in the factory have learned the thread joining operation method. The thread joining technology has not only been promoted in the No. 2 Silk Weaving Factory, but the workers of the No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory are also learning enthusiastically. Everyone wrote large slogans in the workshop: "Learn from Chang Yongfen!" "Follow Chang Yongfen's path!"

　　纺织模范常永芬和她的技术学校
    常永芬是辽东省营柞蚕公司织绸二厂的女工，今年二十岁，是新纪录创造者，是模范的青年团员，是光荣的共产党员。她有过七年的工龄，从私人工厂来到公营工厂以后，生产上更加起劲了。她时常记得自己从十三岁起当学徒的时候，每天饿着肚子还得去干活的苦处，她也时常记得自己是个青年团员。刚到织绸二厂的时候，正赶上厂子里开展新纪录运动，她就开动了脑筋，努力练习捻头，下决心创造新纪录。在去年十一月十日，她创造了用一点四十九分钟捻三○○号规格绸子的二七六○经线头子的新纪录，节省工时两点十分；每月能节省一百二十九小时，可织六百五十七码绸子。当时厂子里的定额是四点十八分，工友们都用接头的办法，最快的是三点半，一般的是五、六个钟头。常永芬在厂子里的发奖大会上，曾对大家说：“我们应该向毛主席保证，我们要保持工人阶级的光荣传统。拿出我们所有的力量，多想新办法，创造更多更好的新纪录。我把捻头的技术教给大家，我们提高质量和产量，努力完成全厂全年的生产任务！”大家立即响应常永芬的号召，学习她的技术，争取完成并超过生产任务。
    在去年十二月十七日，她们第一次订立了师徒合同，常永芬是老师，有六名学员（女工友五名、男工友一名）。当时团的支部领导上对技术学习应由行政领导的思想不够明确，因此在技术学习当中就碰到了一些困难，就拿钉学捻头用的架子来说，团支部书记跑来跑去，忙的满头大汗，也没有解决问题，工会主任问他：“钉架子干什么？”他说：“学捻头！”工会主任就说：“你做的这个架子打耗子都不死，风一刮都能刮跑！”由于架子不顶用，也没有很好的学起来。这样，就使师徒合同在初期所起的作用不大。
    省企业局领导上在一个座谈会上批评了柞蚕公司的行政和工会，不努力推广新操作方法。柞蚕公司的领导上开始重视了这个问题，召开了常永芬小组座谈会，研究学习捻头的办法。
    常永芬教大家学技术非常诚恳耐心。如刘金宸捻的最慢，常永芬就在一旁细心的指导，发现他比别人多费一道手续，就立即纠正过来。常永芬拿自己教技术的高度热情来鼓励大家，使大家学习技术的信心提高。因为车间架子不够，大家需要以换工互助的办法进行学习。有的工友因织绸技术水平低，和别人变工时常把甲等绸子织成乙等或丙等，有的因换工时把自己的绸子织坏了，就闹情绪，有的哭着说：“再也不换了，给她捻头虽然我练习了技术，可也给他节省了时间，看她把绸子织成这个样子！怎么办！”常永芬对这样的学员经常进行耐心的教育。大部分学员情愿因此少得工资也坚持了技术学习。行政和工会对织绸间的工友也进行了教育，并正式宣布：“无论谁在换工的时候都要注意质量，谁织坏谁负责任！”这样一来，工友们学习技术的劲头更大了。
    在“三八”节那天举行第一次测验，王世荣、阎淑云、曲堃坤都超过了合同上规定的条件；其他三名工友在合同到期举行测验时，也达到合同上规定的条件。常永芬在教的过程里，自己的技术也提高了一步，捻一个五○三绺，只用一点二十九分就可以了。常永芬在教徒弟时获得了很大的成绩，但她却谦虚的说：“这主要是靠他们自己的努力，单靠耐心教，但他不虚心学也白费呀！”
    在第一期师徒合同结束时，开了个座谈会，总结了这一阶段技术学习的经验。为了满足更多青年工友学习捻头技术的要求，就在四月十八日签订了第二期师徒合同，有五十六名工友（男工友二十三名、女工友二十三名）参加学习，第一期出徒的六名学员也成为老师。领导上给它起个名字叫“常永芬技术学校”。这一次的学习条件比上一期好的多了；木架子合乎标准了，又建立了会议制度，经常讨论和解决学习里的困难。曲桂英、徐荣、姜桂香已提前四十五天出徒。
    现在的织绸二厂工友们，已掀起了学习技术的热潮，有的工友为了要学技术，在下班以后还不走。现在全厂有百分之八十五的工友，都学习了捻头的操作方法。捻头的技术不但在织绸二厂推广开了，织绸一厂的工友们也在热烈学习，大家在车间里写上了大字标语：“向常永芬学习！”“走常永芬的道路！”
