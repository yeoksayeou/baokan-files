　　The Crime of US Imperialism in Re-arming Japan

　　For five years since Japan's surrender, US imperialism has continuously carried out its conspiracy to re-arm Japan, destroying the Potsdam Proclamation and the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission on policy towards Japan. MacArthur, in his reply to Soviet representative Derevyanko of the Allied Council for Japan on May 4th this year, regarding the protest against the re-arming of Japan, brazenly declared: "The bases and facilities of Great Britain and the United States in Japan must be maintained in a state that is constantly sufficient to deal with any eventuality." After launching the war of aggression against Korea, the US imperialists' conspiracy to re-arm Japan has become even more overt. According to a July 4th United Press Washington dispatch: "US military authorities are reviewing the possibility of re-arming Japan in preparation for the future." Undoubtedly, US imperialism wants to further tighten its grip on Japan to make it a military base for aggression in the Far East. Truman's special foreign affairs advisor Harriman's visit to Japan earlier this month, according to an Agence France-Presse Washington dispatch, was also related to the US re-organization of Japanese armed forces.

　　The US occupation authorities in Japan, headed by MacArthur, deliberately preserved Japan's military potential from the outset, allowing Japan to retain the "Demobilization Bureau," a disguised military general staff headquarters, engaged in concealing, accommodating, and reorganizing Japanese military personnel. After the visits of war-mongers Johnson, Bradley, and Dulles to Japan in June, it was reported that a "Special Military Committee" including fifteen Japanese soldiers such as Iwakuni had been secretly formed to plan the establishment of a 150,000-strong "Japanese Defense Force" after the United States made an "undeclared peace" with Japan. (According to "Truth Special Communications" Nos. 137 and 141)

　　The Japanese army has long been rebuilt under the guise of the police. Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, MacArthur approved the expansion of the "National Police Reserve" by 75,000 men on July 8th. According to Kyodo News Agency and Tokyo Broadcasting, this police reserve will be lent all necessary weapons by the occupation forces, including heavy weapons. Its captain will have the title of Cabinet member and be directly under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Prime Minister. The actual number of Japanese police has now reached 300,000, about five times the pre-war total of 60,000 Japanese police, exceeding the pre-war Japanese standing army of 230,000. On February 2nd this year, Whitney, the director of the MacArthur Headquarters Civil Affairs Bureau, submitted a secret memorandum to the Japanese government, calling for the "reorganization" of the Japanese police into an armed force of 580,000 men, recruiting 400,000 to 450,000 police in the first half of this year, training them by US Army officers, and issuing them with the same weapons as US police. MacArthur's approval of the addition of 75,000 police reserves this time is a preliminary plan for expanding the Japanese armed forces. The Yoshida government has announced that it will begin recruiting police reserves on September 15th. MacArthur also announced on the 8th of this month that he intends to further expand the security police. In addition, hundreds of thousands of former Japanese soldiers are hidden in disguised organizations such as the so-called "Pioneer Group" and "Military Immigration Group" with complete military establishments, which are equivalent to a strong Japanese reserve army.

　　The reconstruction of the Japanese navy is being carried out under the guise of the "Maritime Safety Agency," established under the pretext of "preventing smuggling." This April, the United States handed over 27 escort frigates to the Japanese government that were lent to the Soviet Union during the war under the Lend-Lease Act and recovered in 1949. MacArthur recently handed over 46 former naval vessels to the Japanese government as the core of the future Japanese navy. Under the support of the US occupation authorities, this disguised naval ministry has rapidly expanded, reaching 10,000 armed personnel and 300 ships of various types with a total tonnage of 50,000 tons by July of this year. In April of this year, the Japanese government openly recruited 2,000 sailors. On July 8th, MacArthur approved an increase of 8,000 armed personnel, and the number of ships will also double to 600, making the "Maritime Safety Agency" even larger. A portion of former Japanese naval personnel are also combined into fishing fleets. Most of those fishing boats are equipped with weapons, radio, and surveying equipment, and whaling ships in particular are easily converted for military use at any time. In addition, it is worth noting that the so-called "Cultural Renaissance Data Research Association," headed by former Navy Operations Director Sadatoshi Tomioka, is actually a strategic research institution, engaged in collecting and sorting out various technical research data of the Japanese Navy in the last war, preparing for a new war.

　　The naval bases of Yokosuka, Sasebo, Kure and its famous ports, since Japan's surrender, have not only not been demolished, but have also been added with new American equipment and expanded. US imperialism has decided to use these Japanese naval bases, together with the bases of Okinawa and Guam, to form an aggressive "forward base network." Among them, Yokosuka is regarded as "the best-equipped US naval headquarters in the East," and the naval base can accommodate a special fleet of two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and eight destroyers; the nearby Oppama has also been opened as an air force base, exclusively for naval aircraft to take off and land. In Sasebo, US imperialism spent 10 billion yen to set up gasoline depots, expand equipment, and build a large-scale base. The Karieda port base newly opened in northern Kyushu during the Japanese war is also being expanded. Recently, it was also reported that US imperialism has a plan to "lease" military bases in Japan for ninety years; at the same time, according to the "US News & World Report" weekly, the Yoshida puppet government is also preparing to cede bases in exchange for a permanent US-Japan military agreement.

　　The reconstruction of the Japanese air force is being carried out under the guise of civil aviation. The so-called "Aviation Security Agency" is established under the Ministry of Electric Communications. The US occupation authorities have recruited a large number of Japanese pilots (including kamikaze pilots), who are trained in Japan and secretly sent to the United States for training to form special air force units, and some are directly incorporated into the US Air Force. In April of this year, the US Far East Air Force Personnel Office publicly stated: "The training of Japanese personnel serving in the US Air Force began on April 10th."

　　The US Air Force has more than ten air force bases in Japan. The original two hundred or more airfields in Kyushu, Honshu, and Hokkaido have not only not been reduced, but have also been greatly expanded. During the US occupation, a total of thirty-three large airfields were newly built in Yokohama and other places. More than 3,500 American heavy bombers can take off from these airports every day. The Misawa Airport built in Aomori Prefecture at the northern tip of Honshu is large in scale and is said to be able to accommodate the largest bombers still being designed by the United States to take off and land. This base is only 700 miles away from Vladivostok, within the flight distance of fighter jets, and is obviously aimed at the Soviet Union. The main US air force base in southern Japan is Itazuke in Kyushu. In addition, there are several air force bases in Miyagi Prefecture, near Izumi, Kagoshima, Akita in northern Honshu, and the Sapporo area of Hokkaido. On Okinawa, US imperialism has built permanent airport facilities. Regarding this move, MacArthur claimed: "Only the US government has the right to decide on military activities in this area in any circumstances it deems appropriate," and openly said: "On Okinawa, I have established twenty-five airfields, which can guarantee our largest bombers take off 3,500 times a day."

　　An important link in the US imperialist conspiracy to make Japan a military base is to turn Japan into an "Asian arsenal." After Japan's surrender, most of the munitions, weapons, and ships that should have been destroyed remained intact and were received and preserved by MacArthur Headquarters; some of them have been returned to the Japanese government. At the same time, MacArthur has been trying to support the revival of Japanese military industry, repeatedly removing military factories listed on the reparations list, allowing Japan to retain them. Under the cover and support of MacArthur Headquarters, Japan's 300 aircraft manufacturing plants, 178 arsenals, and hundreds of other military-related enterprises such as shipyards, steel plants, and chemical plants have all started operations, manufacturing various new weapons in large quantities. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the stock prices of so-called "old military industrial" stocks on the Tokyo stock market soared, and the number of orders received by various arms factories increased dramatically. This proves that the plan admitted by Niburg, chief of ordnance of the US Far East Command, that "the US occupying forces are using Japanese factories and manpower to store war materials" has begun to be realized.

　　The US imperialists' conspiracy to make Japan its base for aggression in the Far East has reached a blatant stage, but the Japanese people, with the support of the vast peace-loving working people of the world, are waging a struggle for peace and democracy against militarization and colonization. After the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, the broad masses of Japanese people are responding to the call issued by the Japanese Communist Party to "fight for national independence and oppose participation in the Korean War in any way." Shipyard workers and transport workers have joined the struggle to refuse to repair US warships and transport military supplies. The US imperialists' attempt to militarize Japan is bound to fail.

　　美帝重新武装日本的罪行
    日本投降五年以来，美国帝国主义者不断进行其重新武装日本的阴谋，将波茨坦文告及远东委员会关于对日政策的决议破坏无遗。麦克阿瑟今年五月四日在答复盟国对日管制委员会苏联代表德勒维扬哥抗议重新武装日本的质询时，竟肆无忌惮地宣称：“英国与美国在日本的基地与设备，必须维持在经常足以应付任何事故的状态。”美帝在发动侵略朝鲜的战争后，重新武装日本的阴谋更表面化了。据七月四日合众社华盛顿电讯称：“美国军事当局为准备未来，正进行检讨日本再武装的可能性。”无疑的，美帝要更加紧使日本成为侵略远东的军事基地。本月初杜鲁门外交特别顾问哈里曼访日，据法新社华盛顿电讯称，亦与美国重整日本武装有关。
    以麦克阿瑟为首的美国驻日占领当局，一开首就蓄意保存日本的军事潜力，使日本保留了“复员局”这一个变相的军事参谋本部，从事隐蔽、收容和整编日本的军事人员。六月间詹逊、布莱德雷和杜勒斯三战贩访日后，据传已秘密组成一个包括有岩畔等十五名日本军人在内的“特别军事委员会”，计划在美国对日“不宣而和”后，建立十五万人的“日本防卫军”。（根据《真相特别通信》第一三七、一四一号）
    日本的陆军早已在警察名义的伪装下重建起来。朝鲜战事爆发后不久，麦克阿瑟又于七月八日核准日本扩充“国家警察后备队”七万五千名。据共同社及东京广播称，这个警察后备队，将由占领军借予一切必要的武器，包括重武器在内。其队长将具有内阁阁员衔，受日本首相直接管辖。目前日本警察的实际数目已达到三十万，约等于战前日本警察总数六万名的五倍，超过战前日本常备陆军二十三万的数目。本年二月二日麦克阿瑟总部民政局长惠特奈曾向日本政府提出秘密备忘录，要将日本警察“改编”为五十八万人的武装力量，本年上半年征募警察四十万至四十五万人，由美国陆军军官加以训练，并发给美国警察一样的武器。这次麦克阿瑟核准增加七万五千名警察后备队，就是扩充日本武装部队的初步计划。吉田政府已宣布于九月十五日开始招募警察后备队。麦克阿瑟并于本月八日宣布，拟再扩充保安警察。此外，还有数十万旧日本军人隐藏在完全军事编制的所谓“开拓团”和“军事移民团”等伪装组织内，就等于是日本强大的后备军。
    日本海军的重建，是在借口为“防止走私”而设立的“海上保安厅”的伪装下进行的。美国本年四月曾将战时根据租借法案借给苏联而于一九四九年收回的二十七艘护航快舰交给日本政府，麦克阿瑟最近又把四十六艘前海军舰船交给日本政府，作为日本未来海军的核心。这个变相的海军省，在美国占领当局的扶植下，规模迅速扩大，至本年七月，已拥有武装人员一万名、各种船舰三百艘，总吨数达五万吨。本年四月间日本政府并公开招募水兵两千名。七月八日麦克阿瑟又核准增加武装人员八千名，船舰也将增加一倍至六百艘，“海上保安厅”的规模将更庞大。还有一部分日本旧海军人员则结合在渔船队中。那些渔船多半有武装及无线电与测量等设备，特别是捕鲸船，尤其易于随时改装以作军事用途。此外，值得注意的，以前海军作战部长富冈定俊为首的所谓“文化复兴资料调查会”，实际上是一个研究战略的机构，正在从事收集日本海军在上次战争中的各种技术研究资料，加以整理，为新战争作准备。
    横须贺、佐世保、吴港及其著名港口的海军基地，自日本投降后，不但没有拆毁，而且还增添了美国的新式设备，扩充起来。美帝决定以这些日本海军基地，配合了冲绳岛、关岛的基地，形成侵略的“前进基地网”。其中，横须贺被视为“美国海军在东方装备最好的司令部”，该海军基地可容纳有两艘航空母舰、四艘巡洋舰和八艘驱逐舰的特种舰队；附近的追滨并已开辟了一个空军基地，专供海军飞机起降之用。在佐世保，美帝花费了一百亿日元设立汽油库，并扩大装备，建筑成大规模基地。日本战时在九州北部新辟的刈田港基地亦在扩充中。最近并传美帝有向日本“租借”军事基地九十年的计划；同时，据《美国新闻与世界报导》周刊说，吉田傀儡政府亦准备割让基地以交换永久的美日军事协定。
    日本空军的重建是在民用航空的伪装下进行的。在电气电信省下设有所谓“航空保安厅”。美国占领当局大量征募日本飞行员（包括神风队队员），除在日本训练外，还秘密送往美国训练，组成特别航空部队，有些则直接编在美国空军之内。今年四月间美国驻远东空军人事处公开声明：“对在美国空军中服务的日本人员的训练已于四月十日开始。”
    美国空军在日本有十个以上的空军基地。九州、本州及北海道等原有的二百多个飞机场不但没有减少，而且均已大大扩充。美国占领期间，在横滨等各地一共增建了三十三个大飞机场。每天可以有三千五百架以上的美国重轰炸机由这些机场起飞。在本州北端青森县所建的三泽机场，规模庞大，据说可供美国尚在设计中的最大的轰炸机升降。这个基地离海参崴仅七百英里，在战斗机飞行距离之内，显然是针对苏联而设的。美国在日本南部的主要空军基地是九州的板附。此外，宫城县、鹿儿岛出水附近、本州北部的秋田、北海道的札幌区，也有好几个空军基地。在冲绳岛，美帝更建筑了永久性的机场设备。关于这一举动，麦克阿瑟竟称：“只有美国政府在它认为适当的场合下有权决定这个地区的军事活动”，并且公然说：“在冲绳岛上，由我建立了二十五个飞机场，这些飞机场可以保证我们最大的轰炸机每天起飞三千五百次。”
    美帝使日本军事基地化的阴谋计划中，一个重要的环节就是把日本变成“亚洲兵工厂”。日本投降后，应被销毁的军火、武器与舰只，大部分原封未动，由麦克阿瑟总部接收保存：其中一部分已交还日本政府。同时麦克阿瑟并极力扶植日本军事工业的复兴，一再将被列入赔偿清单中的军需工厂从清单上剔除，任由日本保留。在麦克阿瑟总部的掩护与扶持之下，日本的三百家飞机制造厂、一百七十八家兵工厂及数百家其他有关军事企业如造船厂、炼钢厂、化学工厂等均已全部开工，大量制造各种新武器。朝鲜战事爆发后，东京股票市场的所谓“旧军需工业”股票价格暴涨，各军火工厂接到的订单大量激增。这证明美国远东司令部军械处长尼布格所供认“美国占领军正在利用日本的工厂与人力储存战争物资”的计划已经开始实现了。
    美帝使日本成为其侵略远东基地的阴谋已到了明目张胆的地步，但是日本人民在全世界爱好和平的广大劳动人民的支持之下，正在进行反对军事基地化与殖民地化的争取和平民主的斗争。美帝发动侵略朝鲜的战争后，广大的日本人民正纷纷响应日共所发出的“争取民族独立并反对任何方式参加朝鲜战争”的号召，造船工人和运输工人群起参加拒修美舰与拒运军事物资的斗争。美帝使日本军事基地化的妄图，是必然归于失败的。
