Editor's Note: After the first stage of the rectification study in the first-level organs of the Northwest Grand Administrative Region, which focused on exposing problems, the General Study Committee convened an enlarged meeting of the General Study Committee on August 4th and 5th. The meeting was personally presided over by Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Secretary of the Northwest Bureau of the CPC Central Committee. The meeting reviewed the learning achievements of the previous stage, examined and analyzed some deviations in the movement, and found that some units only started from documents without linking to reality; some units did not seriously study documents, indiscriminately labeled during self-criticism, and missed the point; some organs started from individuals instead of examining the overall work; some engaged in endless pursuit of trivial matters in the examination of work, failing to grasp the essence of the problem from complex phenomena. Finally, Comrade Xi Zhongxun made a summary at the meeting, instructing on how to continue the rectification in the future. The following is the full text of Comrade Xi Zhongxun's summary.

After two months of mobilization and study, our rectification movement has unfolded. The characteristic of this period of the movement is that each department and unit has generally carried out the study of documents, organized deliberation, promoted democracy, and mastered and used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to examine work and expose many problems in the work. At present, the rectification study is about to deepen, that is, based on the spirit of the documents, to solve these actual problems that have been discovered and will continue to be discovered, and to effectively improve work. This meeting is to study and solve some issues related to entering the next phase of rectification study.

The basic link in leading the rectification movement "is to closely integrate the rectification movement with various work tasks. Any rectification that deviates from reality will be fruitless or will not have good results." Some organs are still starting from abstract documents, chanting slogans of rectification, and have little effect on improving work, which urgently needs to be corrected.

The purpose of this rectification movement is to oppose the bureaucracy and commandism that actually exist in our work. This is the basic content of the rectification. Any rectification that deviates from this reality will also be fruitless or will not have good results. We must have a clear understanding of bureaucracy. Not understanding the situation below is certainly a manifestation of bureaucracy; however, simply understanding the situation, sleeping next to the problem, and not dealing with it is also a bureaucratic style. What we require is to both understand the situation and have a truly responsible attitude towards the masses, and actively deal with problems. Some problems require repeated deliberation and careful consideration before making a decision; other problems must be dealt with promptly and quickly. It is correct as long as the problem is handled appropriately and in a timely manner. Some comrades do not analyze the actual situation and only look at the surface phenomena. They criticize slow handling as bureaucracy; they also say that quick handling is undemocratic and also bureaucracy. This phenomenon of indiscriminate labeling is actually treating the rectification study with an incorrect attitude, and the result is just firing some blank shots, which is of no benefit to improving work. Some organs, although superficially connected to reality, are confused by the messy phenomena, swimming blindly in the midst of myriad phenomena. They also do not analyze reality, and cannot discover the essence of the problem, grasp the key to solving the problem. This kind of rectification study, which has not yet emerged from trivial daily details, has no future. The more details are rectified, the more details emerge, the root cause cannot be found, there is no confidence, and it is exhausting. These are all bad.

Rectification study is aimed at things, not people. It is to overcome and oppose erroneous ideological styles with correct ideological styles, to educate and improve cadres through improving work, and to achieve the purpose of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and treating the illness to save the patient." Some organs start with examining individuals at the beginning, finding faults, and rehashing old accounts, which can easily cause the rectification study to lose its focus, which is detrimental to improving work and improving cadres.

The steps for leading the rectification movement should be from top to bottom, first rectifying the leadership, and then going deep into the lower levels. This will enable the rectification movement to be carried out with a center, direction, and scope, and to be more closely integrated with reality. Developing in this way, the lower-level rectification will have a basis, take fewer detours, and achieve twice the result with half the effort. We must first rectify within the Party and then extend to outside the Party, using the exemplary actions of internal Party rectification study to influence and promote the progress of non-Party cadres. This requires being good at using democratic and enlightening methods to launch an in-depth rectification movement, so that everyone understands that rectification is beneficial to everyone, mobilizing everyone to consciously participate in the study, and avoiding the phenomenon of coercion and forcing!

The focus of the first stage of rectification study is to promote democracy and discover problems; but we should also seize the time to solve those problems that can be solved at any time, in order to dispel the concerns of lower-level cadres, increase confidence, and enable more thorough exposure of problems. The purpose of exposing problems is to solve problems and improve work. If problems are not solved at all, then the exposed things become meaningless and ineffective, which is detrimental to the Party's rectification study and inspection of work. The next stage of rectification study should focus on solving problems; but we should also pay attention to continuing to promote democracy and discover problems. Here, I want to emphasize several issues that should be paid attention to in the future rectification study.

Rectification is for consolidating achievements and correcting shortcomings. Even if the achievements are small, they must be promoted and consolidated. Leaders must be good at discovering new things. Consolidating achievements is as important as correcting shortcomings. Failure to consolidate achievements and failure to correct shortcomings are both losses. Therefore, summarizing the experience of the previous rectification study is a strong guarantee for promoting in-depth rectification study in the next stage. The General Study Committee should effectively strengthen its leadership over the study of each unit, specifically help them summarize their experiences, select the focus of problem-solving, study methods for in-depth rectification study, and avoid generalized leadership methods.

The focus of future rectification study is to solve the major problems that have been exposed, in order to improve cadres, strengthen unity (between new and old cadres, Party and non-Party cadres, various departments, and various units), establish systems and reasonable working relationships, and improve work. The most common phenomenon in the leadership work of first-level organs in the Northwest Region is busyness, chaos, and slowness. A new system has not yet been established, and old, outdated experiences are still being used everywhere. A small number of leaders in various departments and units are overwhelmed by the large and small accidents pouring in from all sides; while most of the general staff have either no fixed workload, or are idle, or have work but do not know how to do it, and cannot get the help and improvement they deserve. This requires us to jump out of the old environment. Liberate ourselves from those messy, trivial, and clueless affairs, implement division of labor and responsibility under unified leadership, establish new systems and methods of handling affairs, so that leading cadres can calmly consider overall work, think more about directional and principled issues; and also have the time and energy to help others and train cadres. Training cadres is an important political task at present, and it is also a very meticulous work. Ten percent of the old cadres is not a small number. The problem is that their political level is not high, and their progress is not fast, so they need help. Most of the ninety percent of new cadres are clueless in their work and do not know how to work, so they need more help. Each cadre should be given work to do without reservation. In the process of doing, give each person appropriate help of different degrees and weights, so that they can achieve results, continuously accumulate experience, and get improved. Only by improving cadres can work be carried out. This is the central issue in improving leadership work at present.

The rectification movement must revolve around the current main work and implement the Party's basic policies. Therefore, in checking work and solving problems, each department and unit must have a focus and a specific plan. We must oppose the problem of being disorganized and unplanned, as well as the problem of having a plan but being generalized. What standard should be used to check work? It is Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, which is the pointer for all current work and should be used as the basis for checking and summarizing various tasks. The inspection work of various departments of the People's Government system should generally be based on the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the reports and resolutions of the recent Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and important laws and decrees promulgated by the Central People's Government, such as the Land Reform Law. In particular, the Common Program of the CPPCC should be used as a universal criterion. All thoughts and styles that violate the Common Program should be corrected. Because the Common Program is the general goal of the joint struggle of the people of the whole country at this stage, violating the Common Program is violating the highest interests of the people of the whole country. In the rectification study, non-Party members should be welcomed and encouraged to participate. Passivity and laissez-faire should not be allowed, and even less should they be rejected. However, in terms of learning methods, special attention should be paid to enlightening and consciously guiding non-Party members, and any form of coercion should be opposed. Party member cadres must also check their own thoughts and styles in accordance with the Party Program and Party Constitution, and Party leadership organs must evaluate the merits and demerits, rights and wrongs of Party member cadres in accordance with the Party Program and Party Constitution, and require all Party member cadres to act in accordance with the Party Constitution.

In checking work, it is necessary to grasp the principle of starting from a comprehensive review of work, connecting it to the transformation of individuals, and improving cadres; rather than focusing on reviewing individuals first, and then connecting it to a comprehensive review of work, which will inevitably hinder the comprehensive review of work. As long as everyone recognizes which parts of the work are correct and which parts are wrong; researches the root causes of the errors and the methods of correction, the merits and demerits, rights and wrongs of individuals will naturally be judged as the work problems are solved. Improving cadres in the process of improving work is the best way to conduct cadre rectification study in combination with the actual work. Experience has proven that this is the correct approach. Specific issues should also be addressed in a step-by-step, differentiated manner: if the rectification study involves violations of Party and People's Government discipline, or other organizational issues, they can be handed over to the relevant specialized organs for handling, so that the progress of the rectification study will not be affected by solving these cadres' violations of laws and regulations, and at the same time, the solution of these serious problems will not be delayed by the rectification study; general problems in the work should be handled through and relying on the relevant organizations at all levels in the rectification study; as for major policy issues with universality, cadres should be organized to repeatedly deliberate and launch discussions to seek to open up their minds and completely solve them in order to improve work.

The first-level organs of the Northwest Region plan to end the rectification study by the end of September. Everyone should earnestly examine and approve the rectification plan and strive to be in line with the specific situation. As long as we grasp the spirit of the documents, have a correct understanding and direction of rectification, it is not difficult to do, and it does not need and cannot take a long time. Because the rectification study is just a major mobilization and major inspection of our policies, thoughts, and work style. More important learning is to rely on our continuous efforts in long-term work. In the future, everyone should pay attention to checking, summarizing, and reporting at any time during the rectification movement so that the General Study Committee can regularly grasp the overall situation, promptly promote achievements, correct shortcomings, and lead the rectification movement correctly forward.

　　结合实际解决问题
    习仲勋同志在西北大行政区一级机关总学委会扩大会议上的总结
    编者按：西北大行政区一级机关整风学习，以暴露问题为主的第一阶段结束后，总学委会于八月四、五两日召集总学委扩大会议。会议由中共中央西北局书记习仲勋同志亲自主持。会议中检查了前一阶段的学习成果，检讨与分析了运动中的一些偏向，发现有的单位只从文件出发，而不联系实际；有些单位不认真研究文件，在检讨中乱戴帽子，无的放矢；有些机关从个人出发，而不从检查整个工作入手；有的在检讨工作中无休止地追究生活琐事，而不能从复杂现象中抓住问题的本质。会议最后由习仲勋同志作出总结，指示今后整风继续进行办法。下面就是习仲勋同结志的总全文。
    经过两月来的动员和学习，我们的整风运动已经展开了。这一时期运动的特点，是各部门、各单位都有先有后的普遍进行了学习文件，组织酝酿，发扬民主，掌握和使用了批评与自我批评的武器检查工作，揭发和暴露了工作中的很多问题。目前，整风学习即将深入一步，即依据文件精神，解决这些已经发现的和还要继续发现的实际问题，切实改进工作。这次会议，就是研究和解决如何进入下一期整风学习有关的一些问题。
    领导整风运动的基本环节，“就是要把整风运动和各项工作任务密切结合起来。一切离开实际的整风都将是没有结果或者是不会有好的结果的。”有些机关仍然在从抽象的文件出发，空喊整风，对改进工作，收效不大，亟需改正。
    这次整风运动的目的，就是要反对在我们工作中实际存在的官僚主义、命令主义。这就是整风的基本内容。离开了这一实际的整风，亦都将是没有结果或者不会有好的结果的。对于官僚主义，必须有明确的认识，不了解下情，固然是官僚主义的表现；但是，光是了解情况，睡在事情的旁边，不去处理，同样是官僚主义作风。我们所要求的，是既要了解情况，又要有真正对群众负责的态度，积极的去处理问题。有些问题，是要经过反复酝酿，慎重周详的考虑，然后做出决定；有些问题，则必须及时迅速处理。只要将问题处理得适时而合理就都是正确的。有些同志不去分析实际情况，光看表面现象，看到事情办得慢了，批评是官僚主义；看到事情办得快了，又说不民主，也是官僚主义。这种乱戴帽子的现象，实际还是以不正确的态度对待整风学习，结果不过是放了一些空炮，对改进工作毫无益处。有的机关虽然是表面上联系了实际，但他们是被杂乱的现象所迷惑，是在千头万绪的现象中盲目的游泳，他们也是不去分析实际，不会发掘问题的本质，抓住问题的关键去解决问题。这种还没有从繁琐的生活细节中钻出来的整风学习，是没有前途的，越整细节越多，找不出病根，没有信心，疲倦不堪。这些都是不好的。
    整风学习是对事不对人，是用正确的思想作风克服和反对错误的思想作风，从改进工作中去教育和提高干部，达到“惩前毖后，治病救人”的目的。有些机关一开始就从检查个人着手，找岔子，翻陈账，发展下去，容易使整风学习失去中心，对改进工作与提高干部，都是不利的。
    领导整风运动的步骤，应是由上而下，先整好领导，然后再深入到下边去。这样才能使整风运动有中心、有方向、有范围的进行，结合实际更紧。这样发展下去，下边整风就会有所依据，少走弯路，事半功倍。要先整党内，再及党外，以党内整风学习的模范行动，去影响和推动党外干部进步。这就要善于用民主的启发诱导的方法，开展深入的整风运动，使大家懂得整风对每个人都是有好处的事，发动大家自觉地参加学习，避免强迫命令的又追又逼的现象！
    第一阶段整风学习的重点，是发扬民主，发现问题；但也应当随时抓紧解决那些能够解决的问题，以解除下边干部的顾虑，提高信心，使问题揭发得更多更彻底。揭发问题的目的，是为的解决问题与改进工作，如果完全不解决问题，那揭发出来的东西，就成为无意义和无作用，对全党整风学习、检查工作，都是不利的。下一阶段的整风学习，要以解决问题为重点；但也要注意继续发扬民主，发现问题。这里着重讲今后整风学习中应注意的几个问题。
    整风是为的巩固成绩，改正缺点。成绩那怕很小，也要加以发扬和巩固。领导上要善于发现新鲜事物。巩固成绩与改正缺点同样重要，有了成绩不巩固与有了缺点不改正，同样是损失。所以，总结前期整风学习的经验，是推动深入下期整风学习的有力保证。总学委要切实加强对各单位学习的领导，具体帮助他们总结经验，选择解决问题的重点，研究深入整风学习的方法，避免一般化的领导方法。
    今后整风学习的重点，是解决揭发出来的各项重大问题，以达到提高干部，加强团结（新、老干部，党与非党干部，各部门，各单位之间等），建立制度与确立工作中的合理关系，改进工作之目的。现在西北区一级机关领导工作中最普遍的现象，是忙、乱、慢。新的一套尚未建立，旧的过时的经验仍在到处搬用。各部门、各单位少数领导工作者被各方面拥来的大小事故挤得喘不过气；而一般的工作人员，则大多数是事无定额，或闲着无事，或有事而不会办事，又都得不到应有的帮助和提高。这就要求我们必须从旧的环境中跳出来。从那些杂乱琐碎的、茫无头绪的事务中解放出来，实行统一领导下的分工负责，建立新的制度和办事方法，使领导干部能够安静地考虑全盘工作，多想一些方针性、原则性的问题；也能够有时间和精力去帮助别人，培养干部。培养干部是当前的一个重要的政治任务，又是一个很细致的工作。老干部有百分之十，不为少，问题是政治水平不高，进步不快，需要给以帮助。百分之九十的新干部大部分在工作中摸不上头绪，不会工作，要更多地给以帮助。每个干部都要放手地给他工作做。在做的过程中，给各个人以不同程度、不同分量的恰当的帮助，使他们能做出成绩，不断地积累经验，得到提高。只有提高干部，工作才能开展。这是目前改进领导工作的中心问题。
    整风运动，必须围绕当前的主要工作，贯彻党的基本政策。因此，检查工作，解决问题，每个部门、单位都要有重点，有具体计划。反对零乱无计划及有计划又一般化的毛病。拿什么标准去检查工作？就是毛主席在三中全会上的报告，这是目前一切工作的指针，应以此作为检查和总结各项工作的依据。人民政府系统各部门的检查工作，一般的以中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领及最近政协全国委员会第二次会议中的报告和决议、经中央人民政府颁布的土地改革法等重要法令为依据。特别是要以人民政协共同纲领为普遍准则，凡违背共同纲领的思想和作风，均应进行纠正。因为共同纲领是现阶段全国人民共同奋斗的总目标，违背了共同纲领，就是违背了全国人民的最高利益。在整风学习中，要欢迎和鼓励党外人士参加，不应消极放任，更不应予以拒绝。但在学习方法上，对党外人士应特别注意启发自觉，反对任何形式的强迫。党员干部还必须依据党纲、党章来检查自己的思想和作风，党的领导机关要根据党纲、党章去评定党员干部的功过和是非，要求一切党员干部按照党章办事。
    在检查工作中，必须掌握从全面检查工作，联系到改造个人，提高干部；而不是以检查个人为重点，再联系到全面的检查工作，这样势必妨害了全面检查工作。只要大家认识了工作中那些是正确的部分，那些是错误的部分；研究出错误的根源和改正的办法，个人的功过是非，自会随着工作问题的解决而判明。在改进工作中提高干部，这就是结合工作实际而进行干部整风学习的最好办法。经验证明这是正确的方针。解决各项具体问题，也要采取有步骤、有分别的办法去对待：凡在整风学习涉及到违犯党的和人民政府纪律的问题，或其他组织问题，可交由有关的专门机关去处理，这样就可以不因解决这些干部违法乱纪问题而影响整风学习的进行，同时也不因为整风学习而拖延解决这些严重问题；凡工作中一般的问题，均应通过和依靠有关的各级组织在整风学习中去处理；至于带有普遍性的重大政策问题，则更应组织干部反复酝酿，展开讨论，求得打通思想，彻底解决，以改进工作。
    西北区一级机关整风学习，拟于九月底结束。大家要切实审订整风计划，务求切合具体情况。只要我们掌握了文件的精神，对整风有了正确的认识和方向，做起来是不很难的，是不需要也不可能花费很长的时间的。因为整风学习只是给我们在政策思想上、工作作风上来一次大动员和大检查。更重要的学习，是要靠我们在长期工作中的不断努力。今后大家要注意在整风运动进行过程中，随时检查，随时总结，随时报告，以便总学委能够经常掌握全盘情况，及时发扬成绩，纠正缺点，领导整风运动正确前进。
