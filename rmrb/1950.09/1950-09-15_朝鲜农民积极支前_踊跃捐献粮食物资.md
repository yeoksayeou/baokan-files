　　朝鲜农民积极支前
    踊跃捐献粮食物资
    【新华社十三日讯】综合塔斯社消息：朝鲜农民踊跃地捐献农产品、积极支援英勇的人民军。八月中旬，江原道铁原县的农民李海谢（译音）曾把他收获的稻子送给金日成将军，并附了一封信说：“我们全体农民都在竭力增加粮食生产。我现在把今年收割的第一次稻米献给你，你为我们农民取得了自由与快乐。”
    许多农民跟李海谢一样，给人民军送粮食和其他物品。京畿道的农民向前线送去了十五万九千二百四十公斤的米和大麦，还有许多牲口与现款。忠清北道的农民们除了捐献米、麦等粮食外，还送了五百九十个慰劳袋。
    在忠清南道、江原道、全罗北道和其他各地，农民们也同样热烈地支援着自己的军队。
