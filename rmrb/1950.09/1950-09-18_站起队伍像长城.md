　　Standing in Formation Like the Great Wall
    Lugong
    Countless people with hearts linked as one,
    Standing in formation like the Great Wall;
    Signing our names to support peace,
    One after another closely following………
    Old Zhang is an engineer,
    Celebrating the National Day;
    He is designing a large engine,
    He says while signing his name:
    “To defend peace,
    I will dedicate my skills to the people!”
　
    Old Li is a sand molder,
    Skilled in casting large iron wheels for trains;
    His large hands pick up a pen,
    He says: “Truman has the heart of a tiger and wolf!
    If he dares to invade us;
    I will not only cast wheels but also make cannons,
    Let him go find his godfather Hitler!”
    Little Liu's eyes are wide and round,
    Clenching his fist and pounding his chest:
    “Good, I will sign my name!
    If Truman dares to destroy peace;
    I will swing my hammer and smash his dog head!”
　
    The union chairman signed his name,
    He says: “Our power is boundless!
    If Truman provokes a war;
    He will be digging his own grave!”
    The factory director signed his name with a smile,
    He says: “I represent all the workers,
    Writing a letter to Chairman Mao;
    To defend world peace,
    To welcome the coming National Day,
    We will produce an extra × tons of steel every day…!”
　
    Countless people with hearts linked as one,
    Everyone opposes aggressive war!
    One by one, all signed their names,
    Standing in formation like the Great Wall!

　　站起队伍像长城
    路工
    数不清的人们心连心，
    站起队伍像长城；
    拥护和平去签名，
    一个一个紧相跟………
    老张是个工程师，
    为着庆祝开国纪念日；
    他在设计装置大引擎，
    他一边签名一边说：
    “为了保卫和平，
    我要把技术献给人民！”
　
    老李是个翻沙工，
    会浇火车大铁轮；
    簸箕大手抓起笔，
    他说：“杜鲁门长的虎狼心！
    他敢侵略打咱们；
    我不铸车轮造炮弹，
    叫他去找希特勒干爸爸！”
    小刘瞪起眼睛圆滚滚，
    捏紧拳头捶捶胸：
    “好，我来签上名！
    杜鲁门胆敢破坏和平；
    我抡起铁锤敲他狗脑门！”
　
    工会主席签了名，
    他说：“咱们力量无穷尽！
    杜鲁门要是挑起战争；
    就是自掘坟墓自葬身！”
    厂长签上名笑嘻嘻，
    他说：“我代表全体工人，
    向毛主席写封信；
    为了保卫世界和平，
    为了迎接开国纪念日来临，
    我们每天多出钢×吨……！”
　
    数不清的人们心连心，
    大家一心反对侵略战争！
    一个一个都签上了名，
    站着队伍像长城！
