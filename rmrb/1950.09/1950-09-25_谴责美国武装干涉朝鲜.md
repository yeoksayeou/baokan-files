　　Condemn the U.S. Armed Intervention in Korea
    Hu Zhongchi
    During the preparation for the Second World Peace Congress, peace defenders around the world received instructions on the action program from the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress Committee (see the previous issue of this journal). The four points in the program are: (1) Intensify opposition to atomic weapons; (2) Demand universal disarmament under international control; (3) Prohibit any country from using any means to promote war; (4) Expose aggression wherever it occurs and condemn foreign armed intervention in the internal affairs of any country.
    As everyone knows, the U.S. armed intervention in Korea has developed to an extremely serious degree. To conceal its political and military setbacks in Korea, the interventionist openly violated the Hague Convention (which prohibits the bombing of undefended towns and villages by any means, especially by air and naval forces), and is inhumanely carrying out barbaric bombings and frenzied killings in places with no military targets whatsoever within Korea. This heinous crime, which is clearly an attempt to expand the aggression, is the fundamental factor in the increasingly deteriorating international situation, thereby threatening world peace. Under such circumstances, peace defenders should, in accordance with the last point of the aforementioned action program, forcefully condemn the U.S. armed intervention in Korea and make this the central link in the current struggle.
    The two documents published in this issue of the journal, from the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress Committee and the Secretariat of the Soviet Writers' Union to the United Nations Security Council, express the heartfelt wishes of hundreds of millions of peace defenders around the world, condemning the U.S. armed intervention in Korea and demanding that it be stopped immediately. This condemnation and demand have become such a widespread and powerful movement around the world, which we can clearly see from the Soviet delegation's repeated righteous and eloquent arguments in the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly. On September 5th, Malik stated at the Security Council that, as of that time, more than 20,000 letters and telegrams had been sent to the Security Council from all over the world demanding an end to the U.S. aggression against Korea.
    In the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly, the United States manipulated the voting machine, doing everything possible to obstruct the Soviet delegation's various efforts to oppose aggression and strive for peace. The two proposals put forward by Malik in the Security Council, "Peaceful Settlement of the Korean War" and "Request to Instruct the U.S. Government to Stop Bombing Korean Towns and Killing Peaceful Residents," were illegally rejected by the majority group manipulated by the United States. The draft resolution proposed by Vyshinsky in the United Nations General Assembly to invite representatives of our country to attend also suffered unreasonable obstruction. However, after the fierce debates caused by these issues, the ugly face of the United States as an aggressor, which it tried to conceal, was ultimately exposed more thoroughly, and the peace and justice striven for by the Soviet Union shone even brighter. In particular, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky clearly and resolutely pointed out the correct path for the United Nations and, after proposing the "Declaration on the Cessation of Threats of a New War and the Strengthening of World Peace and Security," hundreds of millions of people around the world who hate war and yearn for peace received tremendous new encouragement. This declaration expresses the true desires of all mankind based on conscience and contains unshakable power of justice. All the shameless deceptive propaganda manufactured by the U.S. war-mongers cannot but be immediately shattered under this pressure of justice.
    This declaration is a plan for establishing lasting peace, and only a very few war-mongers who are willing to be enemies of mankind will oppose it. The points mentioned in the declaration regarding the prohibition of propaganda for new wars, opposition to atomic weapons, and disarmament are completely consistent with the spirit of the action program instructed by the Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress. The last paragraph states: "The General Assembly of the United Nations, proceeding from the necessity of consolidating peace, and taking into consideration the special responsibility of the permanent members of the Security Council in guaranteeing peace, unanimously expresses the following wishes: A, The United States, Great Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union combine their peaceful efforts and conclude among themselves a pact for the consolidation of peace; B, These great powers reduce their current armed forces (ground forces, military aviation of various forces, navy) by one-third in 1950, in order to submit the issue of further reduction of armed forces for consideration at the most recent session of the General Assembly." This constructive, clear, and specific proposal not only fully demonstrates the great peaceful diplomatic policy of the Soviet government, but also truly grasps the key to eliminating the danger of a new world war currently created by the United States.
    There is no doubt that our 450 million people warmly support this plan for establishing lasting peace proposed by the Soviet Union. In order to strive for the implementation of this plan, our peace defenders must intensify their actions during the preparation for the Second World Peace Congress, condemn the U.S. armed intervention in Korea, and all its inhuman and barbaric atrocities. Because, it is very clear that in order for the U.S. war-mongers to abandon their armed intervention in Korea, thereby creating the opportunity to conclude a five-power pact, it is absolutely necessary for peace defenders around the world to give the U.S. war-mongers even greater pressure through concerted action.

　　谴责美国武装干涉朝鲜
    胡仲持
    在第二次世界保卫和平大会的筹备期间，全世界的和平保卫者们从世界保卫和平大会委员会执行局获得了关于行动纲领的指示，（见上期本刊）纲领中的四点就是：（一）加紧反对原子武器；（二）要求在国际管制下，普遍裁减军备；（三）禁止任何国家采用各种方式宣传战争；（四）揭露任何地方发生的侵略，并谴责对任何国家内部事务的外国武装干涉。
    大家知道，美国对朝鲜的武装干涉已经发展到异常严重的程度。干涉者为了掩饰政治和军事方面的本身在朝鲜的挫败，公然破坏了海牙公约（这公约禁止以任何手段，尤其是以海空军轰击不设防城镇与村庄）正在朝鲜境内毫无军事目标的地方，惨无人道地进行着野蛮的轰炸和疯狂的烧杀。这种显然企图扩大侵略的万恶罪行就是目前国际形势日益恶化，从而威胁世界和平的基本因素。在这样的情势之下，和平保卫者们也就应当按照上述行动纲领的最后一点，有力地谴责美国对朝鲜的武装干涉，并以此为目前斗争的中心环节。
    本刊这一期所登载的世界保卫和平大会委员会执行局和苏联作家协会秘书处致联合国安理会的两种文件，都表达了全世界亿万和平保卫者们的衷心愿望，谴责美国对朝鲜的武装干涉，并要求立即予以制止。这种谴责和要求在全世界已经成了多么广泛有力的运动，这我们从苏联代表团在安理会和联合国大会上历次的正义雄辩中间，就可以得到明确的印象。九月五日马立克在安理会上声明说，从世界各地送达安理会的要求终止美国对朝鲜的侵略的函电，截至当时为止，就已达两万件以上了。
    在联合国安理会和联合国大会上，美国操纵了表决机器，千方百计地阻挠着苏联代表团反对侵略争取和平的各种努力。马立克在安理会上所提出的“和平解决朝鲜战争”和“要求责成美国政府停止轰炸朝鲜城镇与杀害和平居民”这两个提案是被美国所操纵的多数集团非法地否决了，维辛斯基在联合国大会上所提出的邀请我国代表出席的决议草案同样遭受了无理的阻挠。然而经过了这些问题所引起的激烈的辩论，美国力图掩饰的本身丑恶的侵略者面目终究暴露得更彻底了，苏联所力争的和平与正义也显出了更大的光辉。尤其是苏联外长维辛斯基清楚而坚决地给联合国指出了正确的道路，提出“制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”以后，全世界憎恨战争渴望和平的数以亿万计的人民得到了莫大的新的鼓舞。这一宣言表达了全人类从良知出发的真正愿望，包含着无可动摇的正义力量。美国战争贩子所制造的一切无耻的欺骗宣传在这正义的压力之下是不能不立即粉碎的。
    这一宣言是建立持久和平方案，只有极少数甘作人类公敌的战争贩子才会加以反对。宣言中所提到的禁止新战争的宣传、反对原子武器及裁减军备各点是与世界和大执行局所指示的行动纲领的精神完全一致的。最后一段说：“联合国大会从巩固和平的必要出发，并且考虑到安全理事会常任理事国在保证和平上负有特殊责任，特一致表示下述愿望：甲，美、英、法、中、苏联合它们的和平努力，并在彼此之间缔结一个巩固和平的公约；乙，这些大国在一九五○年把它们目前的武装部队（地面部队、各种部队的军用航空队、海军）裁减三分之一，以便在大会最近的一届会议上把武装部队再行裁减的问题提出审议。”这一项具有建设性的明确具体的建议，不但充分表现了苏联政府伟大的和平外交政策，而且真正掌握了用以消除目前美国所造成的新的世界战争的危险的关键。
    毫无疑问，我国四万五千万的人民是热烈拥护苏联所提出的这一建立持久和平的方案的。为了争取这一方案的实施，我国的和平保卫者们在筹备第二次和大期间，还得加紧行动，谴责美国对朝鲜的武装干涉，及其一切惨无人道的野蛮暴行。因为，十分明显，要使美国战争贩子放弃了对朝鲜的武装干涉，从而造成缔结五强公约的契机，全世界的和平保卫者们以一致的行动给予美国战争贩子更强大的压力，这是绝对必要的。
