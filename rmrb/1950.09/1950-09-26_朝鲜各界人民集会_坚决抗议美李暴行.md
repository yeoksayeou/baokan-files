Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 23rd: The second report on the investigation of the atrocities of the American and Li Syngman clique by the Central Standing Committee of the Korean Democratic United Fatherland Front has been published, further arousing the Korean people's hatred for the American aggressors and the Li Syngman gang. In recent days, factories, institutions, schools, and rural areas in the suburbs of Pyongyang have held mass rallies to denounce the criminal acts of the American and Li Syngman bandit troops, and have sent telegrams to the United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie to lodge solemn protests.

　　Kim Deok-seok, a worker at a factory in Pyongyang, denounced the American aggressors for shamelessly using the United Nations banner to invade Korea and massacre the Korean people at a general meeting of all employees. He said: We must smash the enemy's atrocities, avenge our suffering compatriots, and do everything possible to carry out the struggle for increased production, support the front, and strive for the final victory of the Fatherland Liberation War. Female worker Chen Dehua said: We must settle the blood debt owed by the American aggressors.

　　Farmer Shin Sang-yeol said at a farmers' meeting in Daetodong: On September 4th, our village was bombed by enemy planes, and my child was killed. I will definitely pay the in-kind tax for the late crops in advance to support the front and avenge my child.

　　The telegram of protest from the general meeting of all employees of the factory led by Manager Li Jingda to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie stated: "You are trying to abuse the United Nations banner to legitimize the American bandits' aggression and openly stand on the side against the Korean people. We will never allow you to bear this serious responsibility and crime against the Korean people. We express our resolute protest."

    【新华社平壤二十三日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央常务委员会关于美李暴行的调查报告第二号发表后，更加激起了朝鲜人民对美国侵略者与李承晚匪帮的憎恨。日来平壤地区各工厂、机关、学校及郊区农村，纷纷举行群众大会，一致痛斥美、李匪军的罪恶行为，并致电联合国秘书长赖伊提出严正抗议。
    平壤某工厂工人金德锡在全体职工大会上斥责美国侵略者无耻地利用联合国招牌来侵略朝鲜，屠杀朝鲜人民。他说：我们一定要粉碎敌人的兽行，为受难同胞报仇，并尽一切力量来进行增产斗争，支援前线，争取祖国解放战争的最后胜利。女工陈德华说：美国侵略者所欠下的血债我们一定要清算。
