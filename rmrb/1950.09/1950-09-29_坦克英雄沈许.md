　　Tank Hero Shen Xu
　　In brave battles, under the education of the Communist Party, he became a heroic, tenacious and technically proficient tank warrior, a shining example of mastering modern combat technology.
　　Shen Xu is a combat hero of the Third Field Army's tank unit, a resourceful and brave tank gunner.
　　On the Mid-Autumn Festival night of 1948, the young People's Tank Force showed its skills for the first time in attacking Jinan City. Shen Xu climbed onto Tank No. 102 and advanced in formation with three other tanks, unleashing a barrage of fire on the enemy positions. The enemy's artillery fire suddenly and surprisingly stopped. But after a while, the enemy regained its composure and began firing at our army again. At this time, the moonlight was hazy and the smoke was thick, rendering the periscope on the tank ineffective for observation and preventing targeting. Shen Xu thought that as a Communist Party member, he should resolutely complete the task, so he bravely stood up, disregarding the bullets coming from all sides, opened the tank's hatch, and used his naked eyes to replace the periscope, clearly seeing the target and observing the enemy's firing points. Then, he skillfully rotated the turret and fired shells. Shen Xu continuously observed amidst the whistling bullets, firing more than thirty shells in succession, finally destroying the enemy's fortifications and covering the infantry's successful advance.
　　The second battle was to cooperate with the infantry in a strong attack on Yonggu Gate, the outer city of Jinan. The tank group advanced under the bombing and strafing of nine enemy planes, and began devastating fire at the front line of the position, twenty yards from the enemy, collapsing the enemy's large and small bunkers, and successfully opening the way for the infantry's advance. Next, the tank group cooperated with the infantry to attack the inner city. Shen Xu's tank suddenly fell into a large bomb crater and could not get out. Enemy planes and ground artillery frantically bombarded the tank, violently shaking the vehicle body. Radio communication was also cut off, so Shen Xu voluntarily requested to establish contact. He dashed out of the hatch, jumped off the turret in one stride, and nimbly passed through the enemy's interwoven layers of fire, running twenty *li* to find the command post. The captain's order was to persist in combat and resolutely preserve the tank. Shen Xu ran back through the sky full of fire. He said to the driver, "This tank was given to us by the Party and the people. As long as we are here, it will be here!" He and everyone else persevered in the tank for two days and one night of battle, trying every possible means, and finally drove the tank out.
　　In the winter of 1948, the tank unit reappeared on the snowy Huaihai battlefield. In the first battle, Shen Xu's Zhu De tank was at the front of the tank group. When it rushed to a position one hundred yards from the enemy, a tank behind it got stuck in a snow ditch. The Zhu De tank fired at the enemy while driving back to provide support. Disregarding the danger, Shen Xu jumped out of the tank, untied the trailer rope, and tied it to the tank behind. Then, braving the enemy's dense artillery fire, he helped everyone drag the tank out on the open ground, and together they charged towards the enemy's position.
　　In the second battle, the tank group attacked the enemy's stronghold, Qianpingzhuang. At this time, one tank was wounded, and Shen Xu's tank was hit by thirteen shells, damaging both tracks. In order to cover the wounded tank and the wounded soldiers, and to prevent them from being in danger, Shen Xu encouraged all the comrades in the vehicle not to leave the front line, and to bombard back and forth in front of the enemy's position. The enemy also concentrated all its weapons to counterattack. Shen Xu fired more than thirty shells with the fastest and fiercest shooting action. When the direct-fire gun malfunctioned, he used even fiercer actions to continuously fire boxes of machine gun bullets at the enemy, silencing the enemy's artillery fire, allowing the wounded tank to retreat safely. In the final stage of the Huaihai Campaign, their tanks pursued and annihilated the enemy's armored forces.
　　Through the education of the Communist Party and continuous battles, Shen Xu has gradually developed into a heroic, tenacious and technically proficient tank warrior. He is from Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, and is now twenty-five years old. At the age of nineteen, he joined the East River Column to resist Japan, and after Japan surrendered, he retreated north to Shandong. In long-term battles, he has consistently been loyal and brave. In 1945, he joined the Communist Party of China. In January 1947, the People's Liberation Army annihilated Chiang Kai-shek's rapid column in southern Shandong, seizing a large number of tanks and beginning to build the People's Tank Force. Shen Xu began to learn tank technology at this time, humbly learning from the liberated tank soldiers. He often stayed up all night, studying hard, putting strips of paper with the names of the parts on various components to read and recognize. He finally became familiar with the complex machines and became an accurate and brave gunner. Now Shen Xu is a commander of a tank company. He is a shining example of people's soldiers quickly mastering modern combat technology.

　　坦克英雄沈许
    在勇敢的战斗中，在共产党的教育下，使他成为一个英勇顽强而又精通技术的坦克战士，成为掌握现代化作战技术的光辉榜样。
    沈许是第三野战军坦克部队的战斗英雄，是一个智勇兼备的坦克射击手。
    一九四八年的中秋之夜，年青的人民坦克部队在攻击济南城时初显身手，沈许跨上一○二号坦克，与其他三辆坦克一起列阵前进，向着敌阵一阵猛轰，敌方的炮火突然吃惊地停止了。但过了一会，敌人神魂稍定，又开始向我军射击了。这时月色迷蒙，烟雾弥漫，坦克上的潜望镜失去了观察效力，无法轰击目标。沈许想到自己是个共产党员，应该坚决完成任务，于是就不顾从几面射来的子弹，勇敢地站起来，打开坦克的窗门盖，用肉眼代替潜望镜，看清目标，观察敌人的火力点，然后机敏地旋动炮塔把炮弹打过去。沈许连续地在子弹呼啸中观察，连续打了三十几发炮弹，终于摧毁了敌人的工事，掩护步兵胜利突进。
    第二次战斗，是配合步兵强攻济南外城永固门。坦克群在九架敌机的轰炸扫射中前进，在离敌二十码的阵地前沿，开始了毁灭性的射击，打塌了敌人的大小地堡，胜利开辟了步兵前进的道路。接着，坦克群又配合步兵攻击内城，沈许的坦克突然陷到一个大炸弹坑里，冲不上来，敌机和地面的炮火，拼命向坦克轰击，车身猛烈地震撼着，无线电联络也中断了，沈许就自动要求去联络。他猛冲出窗门盖，一个箭步从炮塔上跳下来，敏捷地穿过敌人交织着的层层火力网，跑了二十里路，才找到指挥所。队长的命令是坚持作战，坚决保全坦克。沈许又通过漫天火网，跑回来。他对驾驶手说：“这辆坦克是党和人民交给我们的，有我们在，就有它在！”就和大家一起在坦克里坚持了两天一夜的战斗，想尽办法，终于把坦克开了出来。
    一九四八年冬，坦克部队又出现在漫天风雪的淮海战场上。第一次战斗，沈许的朱德号坦克走在坦克群的最前面，在冲到敌人阵地前一百码时，后面的一辆坦克陷入了雪沟。朱德号就一面向敌人射击，一面开往后面去接应。沈许不顾危险，跳出坦克，把拖车铁绳解下来，系在后面那辆坦克上，然后又冒着敌人密集的炮火，在开阔地上帮助大家把那辆坦克拖了出来，一齐向敌阵冲去。
    第二次战斗，坦克群向敌人据点前平庄进攻。这时有一辆坦克负伤了，沈许的坦克也中了十三发炮弹，两边履带都受了伤，这时为了掩护受伤的坦克和伤员，使他们不受危险，沈许就鼓励全车同志不下火线，在敌人阵地前来回轰击。敌人也集中所有火器反击。沈许以最快最猛的射击动作，发射了三十余发炮弹。平射炮生了故障，他就以更猛的动作把成箱的机枪子弹连续向敌人射去，打哑了敌人的炮火，负伤的坦克得以安全的退了下来。在淮海战役的最后阶段，他们的坦克又追歼了敌人的装甲兵。
    在共产党的教育和连续的战斗中，沈许逐步锻炼成为一个英勇顽强、同时又精通技术的坦克战士。他是广东惠阳县人，现年二十五岁，十九岁时参加了东江纵队抗日，日本投降后，北撤至山东。在长期战斗中，他一贯忠诚勇敢，一九四五年参加了中国共产党。一九四七年一月，解放军在鲁南歼灭了蒋匪的快速纵队，缴获了大批坦克，开始建设人民的坦克部队。沈许从这时开始学习坦克技术，虚心的向解放过来的坦克手学习。他常常通宵不眠，苦学苦练，把一张张写着机件名称的纸条，贴在各种机件上读认，他终于熟谙了复杂的机器，并成为一个精确勇敢的射击手。现在沈许已经是一个坦克连队的指挥员了。他是人民战士迅速掌握现代化作战技术的光辉榜样。
