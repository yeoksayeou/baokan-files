　　The "Victory of the Chinese People," a grand color documentary jointly produced by the Beijing Film Studio of the People's Republic of China and the Central Documentary Film Studio of the Soviet Union, is the first color documentary in the history of Chinese cinema with great political and educational significance and high artistic standards. This film, through the efforts of Chinese and Soviet film workers, has been fully completed and will be simultaneously released in fifteen major cities across the country starting at the end of this month.
　　For the remarkable success of this work, the General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army specially held a celebratory gala at the "Dahua Cinema" in Beijing on the evening of the 19th of last month to celebrate the completion of "Victory of the Chinese People." At the meeting, Nie Rongzhen, Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, delivered a speech praising the success of this film. Because this film tells the people of the world how the Chinese People's Liberation Army, closely united with the people, implements the policies personally prescribed by Chairman Mao, grows stronger from battles, and ultimately achieves a great victory on a national scale. Acting Chief of the General Staff Nie Rongzhen also pointed out that the public release of this film will bankrupt the propaganda deliberately fabricated by the imperialists and their lackeys to depict China as backward and insult the Chinese people.
　　Subsequently, Commander-in-Chief Zhu read out the certificate of honor and presented it to the film's director, Varlamov. After receiving the award, Varlamov said, "The honor is not only my own glory but also the glory of Soviet film workers."
　　The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government also held a celebration assembly at the "Capital Cinema" in Beijing on the morning of the following day to celebrate the completion of the film "Victory of the Chinese People." The meeting began with an opening speech by Sha Kofu, Director of the General Office of the Ministry of Culture, followed by a speech by Shen Yanbing, Minister of Culture. Minister Shen first congratulated the success of this film, believing it comprehensively demonstrates the great historical achievements of the Chinese people's victory and is also the first color documentary in the history of Chinese cinema with great political and educational significance and high artistic standards. He then pointed out the film's significant international implications and the reasons for its success, and called on Chinese film workers to learn from Varlamov and other Soviet comrades. Finally, he said, "We sincerely hope that this first cooperation is a great beginning. We firmly believe that in future cooperation, our joint work will play a great role in combating warmongers and striving for world peace!"
　　Following this was a speech by Yuan Muzhi, Director of the Central Film Bureau. After congratulating the achievements of this film, he pointed out that in the process of cooperating with Soviet film comrades, he realized that Chinese film workers must learn from Soviet comrades their cultivation of Marxism-Leninism, the view that art should serve politics, a high sense of mission, and other advantages.
　　Finally, the film's director, Varlamov, delivered a speech. He first thanked the leading comrades of the Central People's Government for their concern and constant guidance regarding this film, as well as the strong support from leaders in various regions and the People's Liberation Army in the production work. He pointed out that this film focuses on portraying the boundless bravery of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people's loyalty and love for them. In his speech, he repeatedly praised the new patriotic spirit of the Chinese people's army.
　　After the speeches, in order to celebrate this excellent cooperation and to thank director Varlamov and other Soviet comrades for their outstanding achievements in this film, the Ministry of Culture, the Film Bureau, and the Beijing Film Studio successively presented flowers and gifts. Minister Shen personally pinned a commemorative medal on Varlamov, and the Beijing Film Studio presented a silk banner with the inscription "Permanent cooperation to defend world peace with cinematic weapons."
　　Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Varlamov excitedly said, "I know that your love for me like this represents the Chinese people's love for the Soviet people. I will definitely bring this deep feeling back to the Soviet Union." (Attached picture)
