Korean Central News Agency Frontline Correspondent Report:

[Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd] The Korean Central News Agency frontline correspondent reported on the crossing of the Nakdong River by a unit of the People's Army, stating: After liberating Daejeon, an incomparably heroic unit of the People's Army continuously broke through enemy defense strongholds in Okcheon, Yeongdong, and Gimcheon, pursuing the enemy and arriving at the banks of the Nakdong River. The river flowed quietly, having been permeated by the blood of the local outstanding sons and daughters – the People's Guerrilla fighters – over the past five years. Today, the People's Army gathered in large numbers, completing all preparations for crossing the river, awaiting the order to cross.

The officers and soldiers of the People's Army were filled with fighting spirit. All combatants unanimously swore to their superiors, guaranteeing to be loyal to the motherland and the people, and to fight in the river crossing operation.

The order to cross the river finally came. At 8:00 PM on August 7th, as night began to shroud the river's surface, People's Army soldiers began to cross the river under the cover of earth-shaking artillery fire.

The Nakdong River is approximately 200 meters wide and 1.75 meters deep. The People's Army river crossing force was led by the Jin Zengdun detachment, with the Jin Wansu detachment on the left flank, followed by the Cui Yushi tank unit, then the Zheng Bingjia mechanized infantry detachment, and then other units. The column, several kilometers long, braved the enemy's intense artillery fire, calmly crossing the river in succession. The enemy was panic-stricken, and enemy planes continuously dropped flares, concentrating light and heavy machine guns, rocket launchers, tank guns, and mortars to fire at us. But before long, the first green signal flare appeared on the opposite bank, and the tank unit successfully crossed the Nakdong River. Then, signal flares continued to ignite. A unit of the People's Army completely crossed the Nakdong River without suffering major losses and continued to advance under the leadership of the tank unit.

    强渡洛东江经过
    朝鲜中央通讯社前线特派员报道
    【新华社平壤三日电】朝鲜中央通讯社前线特派员报道人民军某部强渡洛东江的经过称：英勇无比的人民军某部，在解放大田后，连续突破沃川、永同、金泉等敌人防御据点，追击敌人，到达了洛东江江岸。江水静静地流着，在过去的五年中，它曾浸渗过当地优秀儿女——人民游击队员的鲜血。今天，人民军大军云集，完成了渡江的一切准备工作，等待着渡江的命令。
    人民军官兵战意昂扬。全体战斗员一致向自己的首长宣誓，保证为祖国与人民尽忠，渡江作战。
    渡江的命令终于下来了。八月七日晚八时，当夜幕开始笼罩江面的时候，人民军战士们在震天动地的炮火掩护下，开始渡江。
    洛东江宽约二百公尺，水深一点七五公尺。人民军渡江部队以金增敦区分队为首，左翼是金万肃区分队，后面是崔雨植坦克部队，再往后是郑炳甲机械化步兵区分队，接着是其他部队。数公里长的队伍，冒着敌人的强烈炮火，沉着地陆续渡江。敌军惊慌失措，敌机不断地投掷照明弹，轻重机枪、火箭炮、坦克炮、迫击炮集中向我射击。但没有多久，对岸就出现了第一颗绿色的信号弹，坦克部队胜利地渡过了洛东江。接着，信号弹连续地燃起。人民军某部没有遭受重大损失，就完全渡过了洛东江，并在坦克部队的前导下，继续前进。
