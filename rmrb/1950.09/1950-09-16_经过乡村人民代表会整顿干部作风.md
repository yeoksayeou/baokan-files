　　Rectifying Cadre Work Style Through Village People's Representative Conferences
    Political and Legal Affairs Committee Counselor's Office, Government Administration Council
    Our work team went to the Tenth District (a semi-old liberated area) of Yanggao County, Chahar Province at the end of May this year to assist local cadres in carrying out village-level democratic governance work for a month and a half. From the perspective of the 36 villages in the district that had established representative conferences, the main issues discussed and resolved at the village representative conferences generally pertained to urgent matters such as organizing production and addressing difficulties in surviving the famine. However, we also encountered another widespread problem, namely, the work style of cadres and the relationship between cadres and the masses. The people had considerable opinions about the work style of cadres and demanded solutions. Therefore, rectifying the work style of cadres through representative conferences became one of the important contents of these village representative conferences. Facts have proven that rectifying cadre work style, improving work, and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses through representative conferences is one of the effective methods. The progress and our experiences are introduced below:

    (1) After investigation, the cadres in the 37 villages of the district can be roughly divided into the following types: One type is essentially good, with a good work style, close ties with the masses, and deep support from the masses, but they are few in number. Another type is essentially good, with considerable contact with the masses and achievements in their work; on the other hand, they have made some mistakes of commandism in their work and their work style is not correct. The masses basically support them, but they demand that they correct certain shortcomings. This group accounts for a large number. The third type is serious commandism, doing evil, and deeply dissatisfying the masses. Although there are few such cadres, their impact is very bad, and the masses resolutely demand their removal or punishment. Generally speaking, commandism is the main shortcoming that needs to be corrected among village cadres.

    1. The commandist style of work is very common in leading production. For example, some villages, in order to pursue a 100% soaking rate (assigned by the higher authorities), implemented forced soaking and sent militiamen to stand guard at the village entrance for inspection. Those who did not soak were not allowed to plant. Some villages, in the autumn plowing and spring land preparation, in order to rush to cultivate the land, universally prohibited carts and horses from leaving the village, and even commercial carts and horses were not allowed to go out. The masses said: "Isn't raising livestock for nothing?" Even an old man who was tired from plowing and let his cattle rest temporarily was identified by a county public security cadre named Tian as being lazy in cultivation. The old man was tied up, and his family was also fined to cultivate land for the village cadres.

    2. There are also many instances of indiscriminate deductions and fines: For example, in one village, a field inspector was detained in a cellar and fined two bolts of homespun cloth for arriving slightly late. In several villages, women who could not sing at the civil school were fined half a liter of grain each. When land certificates were issued, someone was fined seven bolts of cloth for demanding land measurement three times. In the crackdown on secret societies, some villages forced members to eat meat and gnaw bones, and some were tied up and forced to drink dog meat soup. To this day, they run away when they see cadres entering the village. The captain of the Tianjiazhai militia did not give his widowed aunt a land certificate and had her tied up and sent to the sub-district because he disapproved of her remarriage with property.

    3. Corruption and waste are also serious problems. In the 37 villages of Yanggao's Tenth District, cadres in 20 villages were involved in corruption, and several villages even engaged in collective corruption. Bao Sheng, the party secretary of Jinjiazhuang, embezzled more than 40 dan of grain, and the old grain officer of Wangqianhuling embezzled about 20 dan of grain. The cadres of Zhangguantun village ate and drank more than four dan of grain allocated for laborers. Hetacun village bought gongs, drums, stage curtains, and performances, consuming more than three dan of grain from the village's tree sale proceeds. The masses are extremely dissatisfied with these and eagerly hope that they can be replaced as soon as possible. The masses in Jinjiazhuang village even captured Bao Sheng and sent him to the district, demanding that he be punished.

    (2) Resolving these issues through representative conferences:

    In villages with the above situations, the urgent demands of the masses are to criticize certain cadres, inspect the village's work and financial income and expenditure; or to remove and punish bad cadres and elect a new village government. Based on the government's policies, laws, and the demands of the masses, we resolved these issues through representative conferences.

    1. The village government reports to the representative conference and launches criticism:

    Regarding the above issues, we believe that the best way to educate cadres, transform their work style, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses is for village cadres to report their work to the representative conference and launch criticism and self-criticism. Therefore, after understanding the situation and grasping the materials, we persuaded and mobilized the village cadres, analyzed the situation based on each fact, clarified right and wrong, affirmed their achievements and advantages, criticized their shortcomings and mistakes, and clarified which responsibilities should be borne by the higher authorities or themselves, so that they could consciously report their work to the masses, answer questions, and conduct self-examination. After doing this, the masses also raised some criticisms and vented their long-suppressed dissatisfaction, thus eliminating estrangement and strengthening unity. The village cadres, through this democratic education, realized their shortcomings and mistakes and could begin to correct them. This further strengthened the relationship between village cadres and the masses. Even in villages with better cadres, due to insufficient democratic life, things are often done without consulting with everyone, and the masses are not informed afterwards, so the masses also have some doubts or misunderstandings. Therefore, in such villages, it is also necessary for village cadres to report and review their work to the representative conference. By doing so, the doubts of the masses can be dispelled, bad elements can be exposed and isolated, and the masses' trust in the cadres can be further enhanced. For example, the village chief of Anmagou village was positive and upright, but because he tightly controlled bad elements, he provoked dissatisfaction. When the representative conference was established, bad elements raised a total of 14 opinions against the village chief, but none of them were correct. The masses refuted these opinions on the spot, recognized right and wrong, and supported the village chief even more, which is an example.

    2. Important issues must be discussed and resolved through representative conferences:

    Due to the masses' aversion to commandism, corruption, and waste, they demand that everything be discussed by everyone, that the village's work be made clear, and that financial income and expenditure be made public. This is a legitimate and reasonable demand. Some villages in Yanggao's Tenth District have established some democratic systems through democratic governance work: major events and important issues are discussed and resolved at representative conferences and implemented after being reported to the district for approval; the work of the village government and the financial income and expenditure are reported to the representative conference within a certain period. Smaller issues are discussed and handled by the village government committee, and daily matters (such as assigning meals, assigning substitute labor, etc.) are handled separately by the various departments of the village government. Facts have proven that this is very necessary. This can prevent a few cadres from monopolizing and dominating, which helps to overcome commandism; and it can place the village's work and cadres under the supervision of the masses, reducing the possibility of making mistakes. Moreover, work done by everyone is much smoother, avoiding the chaos of a few cadres. Now some villages have learned to use representative conferences to solve problems. For example, Dongjiazhuang held three representative conferences to discuss how to deal with the proceeds from selling trees. The opinions were inconsistent and the debate was heated, but an appropriate solution was finally reached. However, some villages do not handle important issues through representative conferences. For example, the distribution of 1,000 jin of relief grain in Qiaotou village was still simply distributed by the party secretary and village cadres, which made the masses feel unfair and very dissatisfied. The representatives also said, "What are we representing then?"

    3. The representative conference discusses and handles cadres who are corrupt or derelict in their duties:

    In the past, when cadres made mistakes, they were often simply replaced by the higher authorities, without explaining to the masses or educating the cadres. Therefore, it is easy for cadres to be responsible only to the higher authorities and not to the masses. This time, in order to make the representative conference a truly people's organ for exercising state power, we asked the representative conference to handle these issues. Those who are found to be corrupt are properly handled by the representative conference after discussion and ordered to publicly admit their mistakes to everyone. If the masses still do not trust them, the representative conference will make a resolution, approved by the district, to remove them. Individuals who have committed serious illegal acts and are deeply dissatisfied with the masses are reported to the district and sent to the county for handling. When doing this, it is necessary to conduct detailed investigation and research beforehand to clarify the facts; and in the discussion, combine the propaganda of policies and laws to help everyone draw a clear line between right and wrong, so that the policies and laws are mastered by the masses. Facts have proven that the people, through the representative conference, exercise state power to remove cadres who have made serious mistakes, which has a more positive educational significance than simply removing them from top to bottom. After doing this, the masses' sense of ownership is also greatly enhanced.

    4. Elect village cadres and improve the organization of the village government:

    The masses often do not trust cadres who are commandist, have a bad work style, or are corrupt and derelict in their duties, and demand partial or complete re-election. In villages where the village government is controlled by individual bad elements, the masses are even more eager for re-election. Under such circumstances, the masses' opinions should be followed and partial or complete re-elections should be held by the representative conference. The results of the re-election have vividly demonstrated that good cadres who are fair and upright in their work style will inevitably be re-elected with highly concentrated votes; and individual cadres with major problems and bad elements will inevitably be voted out. This is a good appraisal and education for village cadres. After the re-election, the masses in the village reflected: "Each round is stronger than the previous round (referring to before and after the land reform), and this round is even stronger. As long as they do a good job, no one will replace them." This shows the masses' satisfaction with the newly elected cadres and the close relationship between the newly elected cadres and the masses; it also shows the necessity of electing the village government by the representative conference.

    5. Combining with the representative conference to rectify the party's grassroots organizations:

    Some party members of the Chinese Communist Party branches in some villages violate policies, have a bad work style, are dissatisfied by the masses, and hinder the connection between the party and the masses. It is also necessary to combine with the representative conference to rectify them in the branch. For example, Bao Sheng, the party secretary of Jinjiazhuang, was corrupt and illegal and hated by the masses. This time, after the representative conference investigated and clarified the facts, the higher party committee expelled him from the party and the district government sent him to the county for legal action. The masses reacted very well. Another example is that the Didi Shui branch was collectively corrupt, which had a very bad impact. Under the supervision and criticism of the masses, the branch returned the embezzled funds and materials, and the branch secretary publicly reviewed and admitted his mistakes to the representative conference, expressed his determination to correct them, and guaranteed to play an exemplary role in various tasks in the future. The masses were very satisfied and restored the party's prestige among the masses. In some branches, due to the major problems of the secretary, re-elections were also conducted in the rectification of the branch, and the shortcomings and mistakes revealed by the masses and the illegal facts of individual party members were discussed within the branch, which was of great educational significance. We believe that this is necessary. Only when the party organization is sound can it better lead the government.

    (3) A few experiences:

    1. It is a very effective method to rectify the ideology and work style of cadres by reporting work to the representative conference and using criticism and self-criticism. It is a good self-education for both cadres and the masses. However, to do this, it is first necessary to investigate and study and grasp the materials in order to powerfully explain the harm of commandism to the work and educate the cadres to consciously admit their mistakes and conduct self-examination. Secondly, because some rural areas lack democratic life, the masses are often afraid to speak boldly at the beginning. Therefore, the leadership must let go and mobilize the masses, resolutely support the masses, and deeply persuade and mobilize them to break their ideological concerns before they dare to raise criticisms in the posture of masters; on the other hand, after the masses are mobilized, the leadership must grasp it well, prevent extreme democracy, and sectarian retaliation. In dealing with the issue of corruption, the facts must be investigated and handled seriously; but the masses must also be educated to know when to stop, not to insist on settling old scores, and not to form a "purge"; nor should they be sent to the court at every turn. At the same time, we must also be vigilant against the sabotage of hooligans and bad elements and expose and isolate them at any time.

    2. The content of rural democratic governance, in addition to holding representative conferences to solve the urgent problems that the masses demand to be solved, should also gradually elect the government conditionally. This is especially true at the village level, because the consistency between the village representative conference and the village government is more obvious. Facts have proven that doing so not only meets the demands of the masses, but also strengthens the organization of the village government through re-election; and because they directly exercise state power, it can further inspire the masses' sense of ownership. Therefore, although our current democratic governance work mainly focuses on holding representative conferences of all sectors, we should also gradually expand its power and implement the election of the government as conditions develop. We cannot think that holding representative conferences of all sectors means that the government should not be elected at all.

    3. In carrying out democratic governance work in rural areas, we should also help establish various democratic systems (such as the requirement that important issues must be discussed by the representative conference, that representative conferences and village government committees be held regularly, that the village government regularly report its work to the representative conference, and that financial income and expenditure be made public) to consolidate the achievements of democratic governance and further build and strengthen the village government of the people's democratic dictatorship.

    4. The commandism in the implementation of work is inseparable from the bureaucracy of the leadership. This time, due to the exposure of the village representative conference, the district leadership learned many problems that they had not known for a long time, and were greatly surprised. They deeply felt the seriousness of the problem and realized that if they did not seriously review and rectify it, it would cause even greater losses to the work. This educated the leadership and promoted them to conduct self-examination, combining criticism from below with inspection from above, which would greatly help to improve the leadership's work style. For example, the district secretary of the Tenth District said at the district representative conference when reviewing the leadership: "We use village cadres more and educate them less, and we have a tendency to be accommodating. We have not dealt with some problems in time and seriously, and we do more work in a small circle of village cadres, failing to go deep into the masses. As a result, we are sometimes deceived by individual bad cadres and still think they are good. In the future, we must learn to use the organizational form and basic methods of the representative conference to connect with the masses and promote work." Indeed, as long as the leadership overcomes bureaucracy, the commandism in the implementation will be easier to overcome.

　　经过乡村人民代表会整顿干部作风
    政务院政法委员会参事室
    我们一个工作组于本年五月底到察哈尔阳高县第十区（半老区）帮助地方干部进行了一个半月的乡村民主建政工作，从全区已建立起代表会的三十六个村的情形来看，各村代表会上，主要讨论解决的问题，一般是属于组织生产及解决度荒困难等迫切的问题；但同时也遇到另一个带有普遍性的问题，即干部作风和干群关系问题。人民对于干部作风颇有意见，要求解决。因此通过代表会，整顿干部作风，也成为这些村代表会重要内容之一。事实证明，经过代表会，整顿干部作风，改进工作，改善干群关系，乃是有效办法之一。现将进行情况和我们的一些体验介绍于下：
    （一）经过了解，全区三十七村的干部大体上有以下几种类型：一种是本质上好，作风也好，与群众有密切联系，深得群众拥护的，但为数较少。一种是本质上还好，一方面与群众有相当联系，工作也有成绩；另方面在执行工作中犯有某些强迫命令的毛病，作风不正。群众基本上拥护，但对某些毛病要求他们纠正。这部分人，数量很大。另一种是严重的强迫命令，为非作歹，深为群众所不满。这类干部为数虽少，但影响很坏，群众坚决要求撤换或予处分。一般说来强迫命令是村干部中极需纠正的主要毛病。
    一、强迫命令作风在领导生产中很普遍。如有些村为追求浸种数字达到百分之百（上级布置的），即实行强迫浸种，并派民兵在村口站岗检查，不浸不让种。有些村在秋耕和春翻地中，为突击耕地，一律禁止车马出村，连经商车马也不准外出，群众说：“养牲口也养下不是啦”。甚至有一老汉耕疲乏了，放牛暂息，被县公安干部田某指为怠耕，把老汉绑起，还罚他家给村干部耕地。
    二、滥扣滥罚的情形也很多：如某村因一看田队员来队稍晚，即捆押地窖，并罚土布二匹。有几个村因上民校妇女不会唱歌，每人罚谷半升。发土地证时，因嫌某人要求丈量土地三次，即罚布七匹。取缔会道门中，有些村强迫道徒吃肉啃骨头，并有的被绑起硬灌狗肉汤，至今一见干部进村就跑。田家寨中队长嫌其寡婶要带产改嫁，不仅不给她土地证，且被绑送小区。
    三、贪污浪费也严重存在。阳高十区共三十七村，即有二十个村庄的部分干部有贪污情事，还有几村是集体贪污，金家庄支书包生贪污达四十余石谷，王千户岭旧粮秣员贪污约二十余石谷。张官屯村干把齐工粮四石多吃了酒肉。贺塔村买锣鼓、剧幕和演戏，吃喝了村中卖树款三石多粮。群众对于这些极为不满，切盼能早日撤换他们。金家庄村的群众并把包生捉起送区，要求惩办他。
    （二）经过代表会，处理这些问题：
    有上述情形的村庄，群众的迫切要求是批评某些干部，检查村中工作及财粮收支；或撤换和惩办坏干部，另选村政府。我们就根据政府的政策法令和群众要求，经过代表会来解决这些问题。
    一、村政府向代表会报告工作，展开批评：
    对于上述问题，我们认为由村干部向代表会报告工作，展开批评与自我批评，是教育干部改造作风改善干群关系的最好方法。因此我们在了解情况掌握材料后，即对村干部进行说服动员，根据每一事实，帮助分析情况，弄清是非，肯定其成绩优点，批判其缺点错误，并弄明那些是上级或自己该负的责任，使他们自觉的向群众报告工作，解答质问，进行自我检讨。这样做了之后，群众也提出若干批评意见，吐出了他们长期积压在心头的不满，于是隔阂消除，团结增强。村干部经此民主教育，认识了自己的缺点和错误，也能开始改正。这样就使得村干部和群众的关系进一步密切起来。至干部较好的村，因民主生活不足，做事往往不和大家商量，事后也不向群众交代，群众也是有某些怀疑或误会的。因此，在此种村庄由村干部向代表会报告与检讨工作，亦属必要。这样作了之后，可以化除群众的疑惑，揭露和孤立坏分子，更提高群众对干部的信赖。如鞍马沟村长积极正派，因对坏分子抓得紧，惹起不满，在建立代表会时，坏分子对村长共提了十四条意见，但无一正确，群众当场驳斥了这些意见，认清了是非好坏，对村长更加拥护，即是例证。
    二、重要问题必须通过代表会讨论解决：
    由于群众厌恶强迫命令和贪污浪费，他们要求有事大家商量，要求明了村中工作情形，要求财粮收支公开。这是正当而合理的要求。阳高十区已有一些村庄经过民主建政工作树立起一些民主制度：有大事和重要问题，均召开代表会讨论决议报区批准后执行；村政府的工作和财粮收支情况，在一定时期内向代表会做报告。至于较小的问题即由村政府委员会商量办理，日常事情（派饭、派代耕工等）由村政府各部门分头去做。事实证明这是很必要的，这样既可防止少数干部包办把持，有助于克服强迫命令；且可把村中工作和干部置于群众监督之下，减少犯错误的可能。并且工作由大家来作顺利得多，避免了少数干部的忙乱。现在有一些村庄已学会运用代表会解决问题，如董家庄为处理卖树款，曾三次开代表会商量，意见不一致，争论很热烈，终于获得适当解决。但也有一些村不通过代表会处理重要问题，如桥头村分配一千斤救济粮，仍是由支书和村干部简单分配，致群众认为不公，很不满意，代表也说“我们还代表个什么呀”。
    三、由代表会讨论处理贪污失职的干部：
    过去干部犯了错误，往往是只由上级简单撤换了事，既不向群众交待，也未对干部进行教育。因此易于发生干部只对上级负责，而不对群众负责的偏差。此次我们为使代表会成为名符其实的人民行使政权的机关，即将这些问题请代表会处理。凡贪污有据者，由代表会讨论适当处理，并令公开向大家承认错误，群众仍不予信任时，即由代表会做出决议，经区批准，予以撤换。个别违法情节严重为群众深所不满的，报区送县处理。这样做时，事前须详细调查研究，弄清事实；并应在讨论中，结合宣传政策法令，帮助大家划清是非界限，使政策法令为群众所掌握。事实证明，人民经过代表会行使政权，撤换错误严重的干部，远较单纯地自上而下的撤换，更有积极的教育意义。经过这样做，群众的主人翁思想也大为提高。
    四、选举村干部，健全村政府的组织：
    群众对强迫命令，作风恶劣或贪污失职的干部，往往是不予信任而要求部分改选或全部另选的。至村政权为个别坏分子掌握的村，群众更迫切要求改选。在此种情形下，应即按照群众意见由代表会部分改选或另选。改选结果，曾鲜明地表现出：凡办事公正作风正派的好干部必然连选连任，票极集中；个别毛病大的干部及坏分子，也必然要被选掉，这对村干部是一番很好的鉴定和教育。经过改选的村庄群众反映：“一楂比一楂强（指土改前后），这一楂更强，只要好好干，没人换他们”。这说明了群众对新选干部的满意及新选干部和群众联系的密切；也说明了由代表会选举村政府的必要。
    五、结合代表会，整顿党的基层组织：
    有些村庄中共支部的某些党员，违反政策，作风恶劣，为群众所不满，障碍着党与群众的联系，也须要结合代表会，在支部中加以整顿。如金家庄支书包生贪污不法，为群众所痛恨，此次经过代表会查明事实，由上级党委将其开除党籍，并由区政府送县法办，群众反映很好。又如滴滴水支部集体贪污，影响很坏，支部在群众监督与批评之下，退出贪污款物，支书并向代表会公开检讨认错，表示决心改正，并保证今后在各种工作中起模范作用，群众很满意，挽回了党在群众中的威信。有的支部，因书记毛病大，在整顿支部中也进行了改选，有的并把群众揭发出的缺点错误和个别党员的违法事实，在支部内进行了讨论，教育意义很大。我们认为这是必要的，只有党的组织健全了，才能更好的领导政权。
    （三）几点体会：
    一、经过向代表会报告工作，运用批评与自我批评的方法，整顿干部思想作风，是很有效的方法之一，对干部和群众都是一个良好的自我教育。但这样做，首先须要调查研究，掌握材料，才能有力地说明命令主义对工作的危害，教育干部自觉地承认错误，进行检讨。其次，由于有些农村民主生活不足，开始时群众往往不敢大胆讲话，因此领导上须要放手发动群众，坚决给群众撑腰，深入说服动员，打破其思想顾虑，才敢于以主人翁姿态，提出批评；另方面，当群众发动起来之后，领导上须要很好的掌握，防止极端民主，和宗派报复。在对待贪污问题上，要查清事实，认真处理；但也要教育群众适可而止，不可硬算老账，形成“清算”；也不可动辄送法院。同时还要警惕流氓坏分子的捣乱破坏，应随时揭露孤立他们。
    二、农村民主建政的内容，除开好代表会解决群众当前迫切要求解决的问题外，还应有条件地逐步选举政府。特别在村级，更应如此，因为村代表会与村政府的一致性，表现得更明显些。事实证明：这样做，既合于群众要求，又能通过改选，健全村政府的组织；并因直接行使政权，还能进一步启发群众的主人翁自觉。因此，我们目前进行民主建政工作，虽然主要是开好各界代表会议，但也应视条件的发展，逐步扩大其权力，实行选举政府，不能认为召开各界代表会，就一律不选举政府。
    三、在农村进行民主建政工作，还应把各种民主制度（如重要问题定要经过代表会讨论，定期召开代表会及村政府委员会，村政府定期向代表会报告工作，实行财粮收支公开等）帮助建立起来，以巩固民主建政的成果，进一步建设与加强人民民主专政的村政权。
    四、执行工作中的命令主义是和领导上的官僚主义分不开的。此次由于村代表会的揭发，使得区领导上知道了许多长期所不知道的问题，因而大吃一惊，深感问题之严重性，认识到如再不认真检讨整顿，将给工作招致更大损失。这样就教育了领导，推动了他们进行自我检讨，把自下而上的批评和自上而下的检查结合起来，将大有助于改进领导作风。如十区区书在区代表会上检讨领导时说：“我们对村干部使用多，教育少，且有迁就思想，发现些毛病，亦未及时认真处理，做工作多在少数村干部中打圈子，未能深入群众，致有时被个别坏干部所蒙蔽，还认为他们好，今后要学习运用代表会这一组织形式和基本方法联系群众，推行工作。”的确，只要领导上克服了官僚主义，那么执行中的命令主义也就易于克服了。
