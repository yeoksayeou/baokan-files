　　My Thoughts on the Conference
　　Li Yong
　　Editor's Note: Li Yong, a national model worker representative to the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, a model worker in industry, and the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Administration, expressed his written thoughts on the eve of the opening of the conference. The full text is as follows:

　　Participating in this National Model Worker Conference is an honor for our working class. In the past, we suffered oppression and exploitation, and no one treated us workers as human beings. It is thanks to the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party that we workers have what we have today! Having arrived in Beijing this time, I want to send my regards to Chairman Mao and all the leaders. I feel really uneasy about everyone's welcome and hospitality along the way. Everyone's contributions are like the sea, and I can't do anything without everyone's help. This morning, the bureau chief invited us to dinner and asked me about the lives and work of the workers on the ground and what opinions I had. I told him what I knew, and the bureau chief listened carefully and was very happy. In the past, it was difficult to even see the section chief, let alone the bureau chief. Now that the workers have turned over and become masters, there is no waiting for that day if you don't work hard! In the past, the reactionaries sowed discord and slander, and workers, peasants, and soldiers looked down on each other. Brothers in the same family were not united and suffered all kinds of hardships. This time I am going to Beijing to participate in the conference, I will humbly learn from the experiences of the soldier and peasant brothers, come back and tell everyone, and jointly improve and develop our railway work.

　　我对大会的感想
    李永
    编者按：全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议工业模范、天津铁路管理局北京分局丰台机务段“毛泽东号”机车司机长李永，在大会开幕前夕，发表书面感想，全文如下：
    这次参加全国劳模会，是咱们工人阶级的光荣。过去咱受尽压迫、剥削，谁把咱工人还当人；有了毛主席共产党的领导，咱们工人才有了今天！这次到了北京，要向毛主席和各位首长问安。一路大伙欢迎、招待，我心里实觉不安。大伙功劳像大海，我离了大伙什么也难办。早上局长请我们吃饭，问我现场工友生活工作和有什么意见，我把我知道的说了，局长仔细听了，非常喜欢。过去别说见局长，就是见段长也很难。现在工人翻了身作了主人，不加劲干活还等待那天！过去反动派挑拨中伤，工、农、兵互相小看，一家兄弟不团结，受尽了苦辣辛酸。这次我到北京参加大会，要虚心学习兵、农兄弟的经验，回来告诉大伙，共同把咱铁路工作提高和发展。
