Xinhua News Agency, August 28th dispatch from Paris: According to TASS reports, the eighteen French peace supporters from Roanne who were arrested five months ago for demonstrating against trains carrying military supplies for the war of aggression against Vietnam, have been declared not guilty and released thanks to the strong support of all the French people.

Since the trial began on the 22nd, the Lyon Military Tribunal has constantly received countless protest telegrams, letters, and petitions from all over France. More than 20,000 workers in Lyon went on strike on the 24th to show their support for the peace advocates on trial. The General Confederation of Labor of the Loire department has also decided to hold a general strike throughout the province if they are not released again. In court, those who testified for the defendants unanimously pointed out that this unreasonable trial violated the democratic rights of the people and declared that the struggle waged by these patriotic people for freedom and peace was entirely in the interests of France. The French people expressed their respect and love for the persecuted peace advocates.

Due to the strong pressure from the people, the judges were finally forced to declare all defendants not guilty. The Paris newspaper *Ce Soir* pointed out: This verdict is a victory for peace, a victory for honor and justice, and a victory for France. By declaring the peace advocates not guilty, the French military court condemned the warmongers, condemned all those who are prepared to subject France to enslavement, and condemned the criminal policies that follow the dictates of their American masters. The Lyon judges have had to acknowledge the legitimacy of the people's peace struggle.

　　在全法人民支援下
    罗安被捕和平战士宣告无罪
    【新华社二十八日讯】综合塔斯社巴黎消息：五个月前因示威抗议列车装运侵略越南战争的军火而被捕的十八名法国罗安和平拥护者，已在全法国人民的有力支援下被判无罪开释。
    自审讯于二十二日开始后，承审的里昂军事法庭即不断收到法国各地无数的抗议电报、信件和请愿书。里昂两万多工人特于二十四日举行罢工，声援被审讯的和平拥护者。罗亚尔省总工会并已决定如再不开释，即举行全省抗议总罢工。在法庭上，为被告作证的人们一致指出这个无理的审讯侵害了人民的民主权利，并声称：这些爱国志士们为自由与和平而进行的斗争，完全符合法国的利益。法国人民对于被迫害的和平拥护者表示敬爱。
    由于人民的强大压力，法官们终于被迫宣布全体被告无罪。巴黎《今晚报》指出：这个判决是和平的胜利，荣誉和正义的胜利，法兰西的胜利。法国军事法庭由于宣布和平拥护者无罪而谴责了战争贩子们，谴责了所有那些准备让法兰西接受奴役的人们，以及那些奉行美国主子之命的犯罪政策的人们。里昂法官已不得不承认人民所从事的和平斗争的合法性。
