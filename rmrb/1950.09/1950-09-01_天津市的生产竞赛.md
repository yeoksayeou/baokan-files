Tianjin's Production Competition
    By Our Correspondent  Zeng Wenjing

    Since the commencement of the city-wide production competition in Tianjin's state-owned factories on May 1st, production efficiency has generally improved. The Tianjin Textile Company exceeded its competition production plan by 9.4% from May to July, with profits exceeding the planned amount by the equivalent of 6.6 million jin of millet. The rate of prime-quality cloth reached 98.15%, achieving the highest record in the country. After the No. 2 Factory of the Telecommunications Industry Department created an assembly line method for motor manufacturing, the manufacturing time for a three-horsepower motor was reduced to 48 hours, breaking the national record. Wang Shengsan, foreman of the Dingxing Engineering Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, created a "assembly line operation, division of labor planning" method for track maintenance, which the Ministry of Railways has ordered to be implemented nationwide. Qian Jiaguang, a lathe operator at the China Textile Machinery Factory, modified the chain milling machine, increasing work efficiency by 45 times.

            How was the competition organized?

    First, it is necessary to correctly assess the conditions for launching a city-wide competition and propose a general goal for the competition. Since liberation, the old bureaucratic management system in Tianjin's state-owned factories has been initially reformed, and many factories have established factory management committees. Industrial production has basically returned to normal, and most factories already have production plans. The working class has been basically organized, and their class consciousness and production enthusiasm have been increasing daily. From January to April this year, more than 50 factories have successively launched production and thrift movements. Under these circumstances, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions decided to launch a city-wide production competition with the general goals of "increasing production, improving quality, improving production organization and management systems, and laying the foundation for quota management."

    Before the competition movement was launched, the following preparatory work was carried out: (1) Mobilizing workers, staff, and even factory directors and military representatives of state-owned factories throughout the city to actively participate in the competition; (2) After democratic discussion, each factory drew up a three-month competition plan; (3) Rectifying grassroots trade union organizations and factory management committees; (4) Overhauling machinery and preparing sufficient materials and working capital; (5) Stipulating temporary reward measures.

    After all the preparatory work was completed, Huang Huoqing, Chairman of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Huang Jing, Mayor of Tianjin, publicly called on the employees of state-owned factories throughout the city to launch a production competition at the May 1st Labor Day mass rally and in the Tianjin Daily. Subsequently, the employees of Tianjin Steel Plant announced the terms of the competition in the newspaper and challenged factories throughout the city. Units such as the Water Company immediately responded to the challenge. Other factories also launched various competitions within the factory, with workshops, groups, and individuals as units. By July, 59 of the city's 66 state-owned factories had launched production competitions. In addition, seven private factories were also swept into the tide of competition.

    The method used by trade union organizations in various factories to organize the competition was to first set a plan for advanced groups and then challenge other groups to promote the full-scale launch of the competition within the factory. A distinctive feature of mobilizing the masses in the Tianjin production competition was the attention paid to uniting and transforming technical personnel and staff. The method was to conduct in-depth class education and democratic management education, so that technical personnel and staff enjoyed equal treatment with workers in terms of social status, rewards, and welfare; helping them formulate personal plans and departmental plans, establishing teaching contracts between engineers and technicians, exchanging theoretical knowledge and production experience, and establishing a responsibility system and promotion and reward system; organizing technical learning, so that staff members who entered through connections in the past and those with poor skills also felt that they had opportunities for advancement. As a result, staff and technical personnel have made great progress. For example, Huang Baoshan, a maintenance technician at the cloth field of the China Textile Factory No. 3, guaranteed to unify the speed of the loom on a regular basis, drew up a detailed plan, and also united the staff of the cloth factory to challenge the staff of the yarn factory.

    After the masses were mobilized, in order to consolidate the achievements of the competition, various contracts were signed and various systems were established on the basis of mass enthusiasm. For example, handover contracts were signed to clarify responsibilities as a prerequisite for competition between shifts. Apprenticeship contracts were signed to improve the technical level of workers and apprentices. Liaison contracts were signed to overcome the disconnection between workshops, processes, and types of work left over from the past, and the uneven development caused by competition. The Water Company's liaison contract was established by workshops with a solid foundation proposing their own conditions and requirements to other workshops and challenging other workshops. Therefore, the liaison contract ensures that the competition is conducted under the condition of mutual guarantee of completion of the regulations. In order to improve quality, it is also necessary to establish and improve the inspection system and the inspection and statistical system, and mobilize the masses to consciously abide by them and check each other in the competition. For example, through liaison contracts, mutual inspections between processes and workers were carried out; the scoring method of the assessment system was revised to increase the quality score, and the masses awarded prizes according to this regulation; when important quality-related issues were discovered, the masses were mobilized to find solutions together. In order to improve work efficiency in the competition, the Tianjin Railway Bureau established several special responsibility systems. In order to exchange technical experience in the competition and find production quotas under the existing conditions, and to promote technical learning in an organized and led manner, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions convened the first professional meeting of engineers and technicians from various factories to study boiler problems. The boiler room of the China Textile Factory No. 1 also challenged the boiler rooms of various factories throughout the city, which created a new form of competition.

    Over the past three months, Tianjin's production competition has made many achievements, which must be affirmed. Of course, there are many shortcomings in the competition. The main key lies in the continuity and leadership of the competition.

            Problems that should be paid attention to

    Competition is a regular working method for mobilizing the masses to ensure the completion and exceeding of production plans. When Tianjin started the production competition, it was called as "launching the production competition movement from 'May 1st' to 'August 1st'", so many cadres and workers thought that the production competition was a matter for these three months, and they should work hard during these three months; after three months, they could take a rest. At the same time, the leadership just proposed that increasing labor intensity was a key point. Therefore, in the process of the competition, the following problems occurred: (1) A few factories simply pursued output and ignored quality. For example, the rubber factory under the Municipal Industrial Bureau manufactured tires, and the proportion of second-class products exceeded 20% on a certain day. (2) The phenomenon of adding shifts and working overtime occurred in various factories. The North Branch of the Electric Factory No. 1 had many waxing workers and extrusion workers who came two hours early in the morning and left three hours late in the evening. (3) Due to the hot weather, factory hygiene and environmental hygiene were not paid attention to in the competition, and in addition, the workers were physically exhausted during the blitz, and the number of sick people in some factories suddenly increased. For example, in July, the number of sick people in the Tram Company and the Automobile Company accounted for 70% of the total number of people. (4) The casualty rate was relatively high. For example, in June and July, the Tram Company injured 15 people and crushed one person to death. (5) After August, many employees thought that "the competition is over, and we should take a break", and individual factories even abandoned the system established in the competition. The time for freight cars to stay at Tianjin East Station of the Tianjin Railway Bureau even increased from 11 hours to 20 hours. These situations all show that the competition has some blitz characteristics. The workers' selfless and self-sacrificing labor enthusiasm should be commended and cherished. The leader's responsibility is how to guide it to regular competition, and should guarantee the workers' safety, machine safety, and quality. In Tianjin's production competition, due to the leadership's gradual clarification of the continuity of the competition, several steps have been taken to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. For example, since June, product inspection has been strengthened to overcome the phenomenon of ignoring quality; restricting adding shifts and working overtime, and guiding workers' labor enthusiasm to develop rationalization proposals and improve technology and working methods, and gradually overcome the bias of simply increasing labor intensity; signing contracts and establishing systems in order to consolidate the achievements of the competition; publicizing the continuity of the competition among cadres and workers, and criticizing the phenomenon of slackness. In this way, the output and quality of various factories in August generally did not decrease, and some factories even had an upward trend. In the future, if various factories implement material rewards, product inspections, and various contracts and systems, and formulate plans on a monthly, quarterly, or even half-yearly or yearly basis (including quality, labor protection, etc.), and mobilize workers to carry out competitions according to the plan, the competition will be carried out regularly, and rationalization proposals, technical improvements, etc. will become the main content.

    On the other hand, competition is also a conscious and voluntary activity of the working masses, and it is the masses' own business. The trade union is the workers' own organization and a school for learning to manage production. Therefore, the competition should be organized by the trade union. Tianjin established a Production Competition Committee to lead the city's production competition and stipulated that the Factory Management Committee should lead the competition in each factory. Of course, it is very necessary for the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League in the enterprise sector to work together to do a good job in the competition, and this is still one of the main factors for the success of the competition. However, the organizational system should be respected, and the functions of each organization should be fully utilized. The Party committee and branch should provide effective leadership for the production competition. However, the Party's leadership is realized through the correct grasp of the direction and the use of Party members' publicity and mobilization and exemplary role. It is still the responsibility of the factory administration to determine production plans, ensure material conditions such as raw materials, equipment, working capital, technical safety, and sanitation, in order to facilitate the smooth development of the competition. It is also necessary for Party and administrative cadres to provide assistance to trade union cadres in some factories who have weaker abilities, but it is not right to replace and take over everything, because this will only hinder the exertion of workers' enthusiasm. Some workers in Tianjin said: "The competition is a matter for us workers, so why is the administration issuing orders?" This reflection deserves attention. Now, in order to overcome this shortcoming, Tianjin is preparing to end the Production Competition Committee after the current assessment of models, and the trade union will organize the competition, and at the same time absorb new active members from the employees to enrich the leadership of the trade union.

    In addition, there are many other shortcomings, such as the fact that individual competition, which is the basic form of competition, is not yet widespread, the rationalization proposal movement has not been carried out in a planned and organized manner, the mass mobilization of small and medium-sized factories (such as units under the Industrial Bureau) has not been done well, and many individual plans, group plans, and contracts have become formalities. But as long as the leadership is improved and the competition is made regular, these shortcomings can be overcome.

　　天津市的生产竞赛
    本报记者  曾文经
    天津各公营工厂自“五一”展开全市性生产竞赛以来，生产效率普遍提高。天津中纺公司五、六、七三个月超过竞赛生产计划百分之九·四，超计划利润达小米六百六十万斤。正布率达百分之九八·一五，达到了全国最高纪录。电讯工业处第二厂创造了马达制造的流水作业法后，三匹马力马达的制造工时，减至四十八小时，突破了全国纪录。天津铁路局定兴工区工长王省三创造“流水作业、分工计划”的养路法，铁道部已通令全国推行。中纺机械厂车工钱嘉光改造铣链子机，工作效率提高四十五倍。
            竞赛是怎样搞起来的？
    首先，要正确估计展开全市性竞赛的条件，提出竞赛的总目标。天津各公营工厂自解放以来，旧的官僚管理制度已经初步改革，许多工厂成立了工厂管理委员会。工业生产基本上已趋正常，多数工厂已经有了生产计划。工人阶级已经基本上组织起来，他们的阶级觉悟和生产热忱已日益提高。今年一月至四月，已经有五十多个工厂先后分别展开生产节约运动。在这种情况下，中共天津市委和天津市总工会才确定在全市范围内展开以“增加产量，提高质量，改善生产组织和管理制度，打下定额管理的基础”为总目标的全市性的生产竞赛。
    竞赛运动展开前，并进行下列准备工作：（一）发动全市公营工厂的工人、职员以至厂长、军事代表，踊跃参加竞赛；（二）各厂经过民主讨论，订出三个月的竞赛计划；（三）整顿工会基层组织和工厂管理委员会；（四）检修机器，准备充足的材料和流动资金；（五）规定临时奖励办法。
    各项准备工作就绪后，市总工会主席黄火青和市长黄敬在“五一”劳动节群众大会和天津日报上公开号召全市公营工厂职工展开生产竞赛。接着，天津钢厂职工在报上公布竞赛条件，向全市各厂挑战，自来水公司等单位立即起来应战。其他工厂也都纷纷在厂内进行以车间、小组、个人为单位的各种竞赛。到七月，全市六十六个公营工厂中，已有五十九个工厂展开生产竞赛。此外，有七个私营工厂，也卷入了竞赛的热潮。
    各厂工会组织竞赛的方法，是先订好先进小组的计划，然后向各小组挑战，来推动工厂内竞赛的全面展开。天津市生产竞赛中发动群众的特色，是注意了团结改造技术人员和职员。其方法是深入进行阶级教育和民主管理教育，使技术人员和职员在社会地位、奖励、福利等方面和工人享受平等待遇；帮助他们订个人计划和部门计划，订立工程师和技工之间的教学合同，交流理论知识和生产经验，确立负责制和升级奖励制；组织技术学习，使过去靠“门子”进来和技术不好的职员也感到有上进的机会。这样一来，职员和技术人员有很大进步。如中纺三厂布场保全技师黄宝珊保证定期统一布机转数，订出详细计划，还团结布厂职员向纱厂职员挑战。
    在群众发动以后，为了巩固竞赛的成果，便在群众热情的基础上，订立各种合同和建立各种制度。如订立交班合同，分清责任，作为班与班竞赛的先决条件。订立师徒合同，以提高工徒的技术水平。订立联系合同，来克服过去遗留下来的车间、工序、工别的互不衔接和由于竞赛而产生的发展不平衡现象。自来水公司的联系合同，是由工作有基础的车间提出自己的条件和对其他车间的要求，向其他车间挑战而订立起来的。所以，联系合同是使竞赛在互相保证完成规定条件下进行的。为了提高质量，又需要建立和健全检验制度和检查统计制度，并在竞赛中发动群众自觉遵守，互相检查。如通过联系合同，展开工序间和工人间的相互检查；修改考核制度的评分办法，提高质量分数，群众根据这规定评奖；发现有关质量的重要问题，便发动群众共同设法解决等。为了在竞赛中提高工作效率，天津铁路局建立了若干专责制。为了在竞赛中交流技术经验，在现有条件下找出生产定额，有组织有领导的推动技术学习，市总召集各厂工程师和技术工人举行第一次专业会议，研究锅炉问题。中纺一厂锅炉间并向全市各厂锅炉间挑战，这又创造了新的竞赛形式。
    三个月来，天津市的生产竞赛，曾做出许多成绩，这是必须肯定的。当然，在竞赛中，缺点也是不少的。而主要的关键，则在于竞赛的经常性和领导问题上。
            应该注意的问题
    竞赛，是动员群众保证生产计划完成和超过的经常工作方法。天津开始展开生产竞赛时，是以“开展‘五一’至‘八一’的生产竞赛运动”作为号召的，因而许多干部和工人以为生产竞赛是这三个月间的事情，在这三个月内要好好的拚一拚；过了三个月，就可以歇一歇了。同时，领导上正好提出增加劳动强度是一个重点。因此，在竞赛过程中，便发生下面的几个问题：（一）少数工厂单纯追求产量，忽视质量，如市工业局所属橡胶厂某日制造车胎，二等品占百分之二十以上。（二）各厂普遍发生加点加班现象，电工一厂北分厂曾有许多涂腊工人和挤胶工人早晨早来二小时，晚上迟走三小时。（三）由于天气炎热，工厂卫生和环境卫生在竞赛中未加重视，加之工人在突击工作中体力疲惫，有些工厂的病号突然增加。如电车公司和汽车公司七月份病号均占总人数百分之七十。（四）伤亡率较大，如电车公司六、七两月份撞伤十五人，压死一人。（五）在八月后，不少职工以为“竞赛过去了，可得休息一下”，个别工厂甚至放弃了竞赛中建立起来的制度。天津铁路局天津东站货车留站时间，竟有由十一小时延长到二十小时的现象。这些情况，都说明竞赛中带有某些突击性。工人的奋不顾身，自我牺牲的劳动热情是应该嘉许和珍贵的，领导者的责任是如何把它引导向经常性竞赛方面去，并应在工人身体安全、机器安全、质量等方面进行保证。在天津市生产竞赛中，由于领导上对于竞赛的经常性的认识逐渐明确，已采取了若干步骤来克服上述的缺点。如自六月起，加强产品检验，克服忽视质量的现象；限制加点加班，把工人劳动热情引向开展合理化建议，改进技术和工作法方面去，逐步克服单纯提高劳动强度的偏向；订立合同和建立制度，以期巩固竞赛的成果；在干部和工人中宣传竞赛的经常性，批评松懈的现象等。这样，八月份各厂产量和质量一般尚未降低，有些工厂且有上升趋势。今后各厂如把物质奖励、产品检查以及各种合同和制度贯彻下去，按月按节以至半年、一年订出计划（包括质量、劳保等），并发动工人按计划来进行竞赛，竞赛就经常展开起来了，而合理化建议，改进技术等就会成为主要内容了。
    另一方面，竞赛又是劳动群众自觉自愿的活动，是群众自己的事情。工会是职工自己的组织，是学习管理生产的学校，因此，竞赛应该由工会来组织。天津市成立生产竞赛委员会来领导全市的生产竞赛，并规定在各厂内由工厂管理委员会来领导竞赛。当然，企业部门中的党、政、工、团一致要把竞赛搞好，这是非常必要的，而且这还是竞赛获得成功的主要因素之一。但组织系统是应该被尊重的，各组织的机能是应该充分发挥的。党委和支部对于生产竞赛应作有效的领导。但党的领导，是对方针的正确掌握，方法上运用党员的宣传鼓动和模范作用等来实现的。对于定生产计划、保证原料、设备、流动资金、技术安全、清洁卫生等物质条件，以利竞赛的顺利展开，还是工厂行政上应尽的责任。有些工厂工会干部能力较弱，党和行政干部给予扶助，也是必要的，但一切代替包办，都是不对的，因为这只有妨碍工人积极性的发挥。天津有些工人说：“竞赛是咱们工人的事，为什么倒是行政来下命令了？”这种反映是值得注意的。现在为了克服这种缺点，天津市已准备在这次评定模范之后，便将生产竞赛委员会结束，由工会来组织竞赛，同时吸收职工中新的积极分子来充实工会的领导。
    此外，还有许多缺点，如作为竞赛基本形式的个人竞赛还不普遍，合理化建议运动还没有做到有计划有组织的展开，中小工厂（如工业局所属各单位）的群众发动做的差，许多个人计划、小组计划以及合同等流于形式。但只要改进领导，把竞赛使之经常化，这些缺点都是可以克服的。
