Serious waste due to chaotic management
Shenyang No. 53 Factory Formulates Improvement Measures During Rectification

[This newspaper Shenyang News] In the Shenyang No. 53 Factory, due to the close combination of upper and lower levels, both inside and outside the Party, and the promotion of democracy under leadership, the rectification work has revealed serious problems in business management and branch work, and preliminary solutions have been proposed.

The factory's rectification work began with an inspection of business management, which revealed that business management was far behind the requirements of production. This was primarily reflected in the unsound statistical work, with discrepancies between many inventory materials and book figures. For example, the machines allocated by the factory to other factories had been moved away for more than half a year, but had not yet been written off in the books. When making the semi-annual final accounts, it was discovered that 32 machines, worth more than 360 million yuan (Northeast currency), had not been recorded. The inspection system was not strict; sometimes qualified products were counted as defective products, or defective products were counted as qualified products, affecting the accuracy of cost calculation. For example, 3,000 jin of qualified molds, originally worth 120 million yuan (Northeast currency), were entered into the defective products warehouse and calculated at only 3 million yuan as defective products. Cadres lacked an overall concept; when making budgets, they all had the idea of "it doesn't hurt to report more." Individual units even reported 20% more than the quota. More seriously, sometimes they asked for whatever the higher authorities gave them, regardless of need, resulting in an increase in material reserves and unnecessary capital backlog.

Secondly, it was reflected in the failure to establish many systems in a timely manner, and the failure to implement those that had been established well. When other factories and mines universally established the production responsibility system, the factory leaders believed that "the situation in this factory is different" and did not implement it. This made it impossible to quickly eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible in production, and the technical responsibility system was particularly chaotic. There was no fixed contact system between technical personnel, so they each did their own thing and could not exert collective wisdom. Although it was stipulated that technicians and engineers should bear full responsibility for quality, there were no specific provisions on what responsibilities they should bear. Because of this, technical personnel did not go deep enough into the field and did not combine their work with the workers' experience, resulting in errors in the drawings and waste in production. The Party's work in guaranteeing and supervising production was not in-depth enough, and it did not pay attention to summarizing experiences or seizing typical examples to promote work. The Party's work plan often only put forward general appeals and did not point out which key issues each unit should grasp in the implementation of the plan. Therefore, some branches simply transmitted and discussed tasks in the same way, without grasping the actual problems in the work. For example, Zhao Enbo's team in the factory created very good experience, but the branch failed to summarize and promote it. When other factories came to visit and asked how the Zhao Enbo team was cultivated, the branch could not answer a single sentence. In the third quarter's Party work plan, it was proposed to learn from the experience of the Zhao Enbo team. When the Fifth Branch conveyed this plan, a Party member asked the branch secretary, "What is the experience of the Zhao Enbo team?" The branch secretary replied, "I don't know either."

The factory also revealed serious bureaucratic work style on the leadership's part during the inspection: they were not good at using inspection and summary to promote work and improve cadres, and they regarded summary as simply making reports to the higher authorities, so they were finished once they wrote and sent them. Secondly, they were not good at utilizing organizational structures and did not implement a hierarchical responsibility system, resulting in everything being brought to the factory director, who was busy all day with talking, stamping, and approving notes.

After checking out the above shortcomings, the factory has begun to rush to produce business procedures and technical procedures to overcome the chaotic state of business management, and decided to take the following measures to overcome the leadership's bureaucratic tendencies: 1. Adhere to the system of inspection and summary work, and promote work and improve cadres through summary. 2. Improve and adhere to regular example meetings and reporting system, and minimize ad hoc meetings. 3. Adopt written requests and reporting methods to avoid oral lectures that are forgotten after speaking. 4. Improve the organizational structure, allocate cadres, and solve the problem of low ability through training. Clarify the powers and work systems of cadres, and ensure that responsibilities are assigned at each level. 5. Strengthen the planning of work. All levels of leading cadres must plan the work for the next day in the afternoon of each day, and plan the work for the next week every weekend.

### 经营管理紊乱浪费现象严重  沈阳五三工厂整风中制定改进办法

　　经营管理紊乱浪费现象严重
    沈阳五三工厂整风中制定改进办法
    【本报沈阳讯】沈阳五三工厂的整风工作，由于上、下、党内、党外的密切结合，和有领导的发扬民主，在检查工作中，揭发出经营管理上及支部工作中的严重问题，并初步提出克服的办法。
    该厂整风工作，是先从经营管理方面着手检查的，从中发现经营管理大大落后于生产的要求。这首先表现在统计工作不健全，不少库存材料与账面数字不符。如该厂拨给外厂的机器，已经搬走半年多了，但账上还没有勾销；作上半年决算时，发现有三十二台机器没上账，约值三亿六千余万元（东北币）；检查制度不严格，有时竟把合格品当成废品统计，或把废品当合格品统计，影响计算成本的精确性。例如曾把三千斤合格的模子打入废品库，这些模子原值一亿二千万元（东北币），当成废品后仅按三百万元计算。干部思想中缺乏整体观念，作预算时，都存在着“多报点没亏吃”的想法。个别单位甚至照定额多报百分之二十，更严重的是有时不管需要与否，只要上级给就要，致使材料储备量增加，造成不应有的资金积压。
    其次，表现在许多制度没有及时建立，建立的也不能很好贯彻。当其他厂、矿普遍建立生产责任制时，该厂领导上认为：“本厂情况不同”，没有贯彻执行。这就使得生产中的无人负责现象，不能迅速清除，技术责任制尤为混乱。技术人员之间，没有一定的联系制度，因而各干各的，不能发挥集体的智慧。虽然规定技师、工程师在质量上负完全责任，但到底负那些责任，却无具体规定。正因为这样，技术人员深入现场不够，没有结合工人的经验，制出的图纸，以致常出错误，造成生产上的浪费。党对保证监督生产方面的工作很不深入，不重视总结经验、不会抓住典型，推动工作。党的工作计划，常常只提出了一般性的号召，没有指出各单位在执行中，应抓住那些关键问题，来贯彻总的计划。因此，有的支部就依样画葫芦的传达、讨论任务，而抓不住工作中的实际问题。例如该厂赵恩波小组创造了很好的经验，支部未能总结推广。外厂来参观，问到赵恩波小组是如何培养的，支部就一句也答不上来。第三季度党的工作计划中，提出学习赵恩波小组的经验。五支部在传达这个计划时，一个党员问支书“赵恩波小组有啥经验？”支书答：“我也不知道。”
    该厂在检查工作中，并揭发了领导上的严重的事务主义作风：不善于利用检查、总结来推动工作，提高干部，把总结看成是单纯给上级做报告，因此写完送走就算完事。其次是不善于利用组织机构，没有实行按级负责制，结果是大小事都找厂长，使厂长整天忙于谈话、盖章与批条子等琐事。
    检查出以上缺点后，该厂已着手赶制业务规程与技术规程，以克服经营管理上的混乱状态，并决定采取以下几个办法，克服领导上的事务主义：一、坚持检查总结工作制度，通过总结，推动工作，提高干部。二、健全、坚持正规例会及汇报制度，尽量减少临时会议。三、采用书面请示与报告方式，避免口头一讲，讲了又忘。四、健全组织机构，调配干部，能力低的由培养中解决。明确干部的职权与工作制度，切实做到按级负责。五、加强工作的计划性，各级领导干部每天下午必须计划出次日的工作，每周末计划出下周的工作。
