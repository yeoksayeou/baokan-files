	A Political Instructor from a Military Company Stationed in Xiangtan County
	Illegally Beats a Township Chairman
	Editor:
	Recently in Baishigang, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan County, Hunan, an incident occurred in which a stationed military unit (a machine gun company of a certain regiment of the Fourth Field Army) illegally tied up and beat the township chairman, Weng Hansheng. The course of events is as follows:
	On September 10th, Weng Hansheng, the chairman of Six Hearts Township, went to the Wang military representative of the power plant to discuss the price of the power plant's foundation. When he entered, the guard, not believing Weng's identification as township chairman, refused to let him in, and an argument ensued. Later, after Weng's repeated requests, he was allowed to enter. After Weng found the Wang military representative and settled the matter, he told him about the argument he had with the guard. Wang said, "You are both at fault and should apologize to each other!" Weng said, "Since both of us are at fault, let's just forget about it!" Wang said, "That won't do, it won't solve the problem." Wang also argued with Weng about this. Yin, the squad leader of the third squad stationed at the plant, then called Zhu, the political instructor of the company, and told him about the matter. Zhu ordered Weng to be sent to the company headquarters for handling. Weng initially refused to go; later he said that if he had to go, the soldier who argued with him would have to go with him. Squad Leader Yin called Political Instructor Zhu again. Zhu then said that Weng was a bad element, disrupting the power plant, and ordered him to be tied up and sent to the company headquarters. Weng said, "Today I came to discuss the problem with you, and Representative Wang knew me in the past. I am not a bad element destroying the power plant, why are you tying me up and sending me to the company headquarters?" At this time, a comrade in the squad punched Weng to the ground, tied him tightly with a thick rope, dragged Weng backwards, and cursed him while dragging him. Soon, Weng fell into a coma, and the skin on his back and arms was scraped off. After the Zhuzhou Town Government discovered this, it immediately sent Comrade Zhang Wenli to understand the situation, but Squad Leader Yin was evasive and said that he had sent him to Baishigang. Comrade Zhang Wenli immediately rushed to Baishigang and saw that Weng was still in a coma. The next morning, Zhang went to the power plant again and raised his concerns with Representative Wang and Political Instructors Zhu and Zhang, but Zhu and Zhang not only did not accept them, but also said, "It would be right if this Weng died; it would be nothing to execute him."
	We believe that Political Instructor Zhu of this company's arbitrary order to tie people up is an act of violating human rights. And Military Representative Wang, knowing that Weng was the township chairman and came to discuss the problem, did not stop their illegal behavior, and should be severely criticized.

### 湘潭县驻军某连政指  非法殴打乡主席

　　湘潭县驻军某连政指
    非法殴打乡主席编辑同志：
    湖南湘潭县株州白石港最近发生驻军（四野某团机枪连）非法捆打乡主席翁汉生的事件。事情的经过是这样的：
    九月十日，四心乡主席翁汉生为发电厂地基的价格问题，去找该厂王军事代表商谈。进门时，警卫战士因不相信翁的乡主席身份证明，不准他进去，双方遂发生口角。后来经过翁的再三请求，才允许他进去。翁找到王军事代表把问题谈妥后，即将他和警卫战士口角的事告诉他。王说：“你们都有错误，应该互相道歉！”翁说：“既然两个人都有错误，就算了吧！”王说：“那不行，不能解决问题。”王代表与翁也因此争执起来。驻该厂三班尹班长即打电话给该连朱指导员，把这事告诉了他。朱叫将翁送连部处理。翁最初不肯去；后来他说，要去就得和跟他发生口角的战士同去。尹班长再打电话给朱指导员。朱即说翁是坏分子，捣乱电厂，叫把他捆送到连部去。翁说：“今天我是来和你们商谈问题的，王代表过去就认识我。我不是破坏电厂的坏分子，为什么要把我捆送到连部？”此时该班某同志将翁一拳打倒在地，用巨绳紧捆，将翁倒拖着走，并且边拖边骂。不久，翁即昏迷不省人事，背上、手臂上的皮都擦破了。株州镇公所发觉此事后，即派张文理同志前往了解情况，但尹班长竟支吾其词，说已把他送往白石港去了。张文理同志马上赶到白石港，见翁尚在昏迷中。第二天早上，张又前往发电厂，向王代表和朱张两指导员提出了意见，可是朱张两人不但不接受，反而说：“翁这个人死了也活该；枪毙了也没啥。”
    我们认为：该连朱指导员随便下令捆人，是侵犯人权的行为。而王军事代表明知翁是乡主席，又是来商谈问题的，却不去制止他们两人的违犯法纪的行为，应受到严格的批评。
