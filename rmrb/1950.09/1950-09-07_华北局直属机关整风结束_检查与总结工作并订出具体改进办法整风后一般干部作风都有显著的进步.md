[Reported by this newspaper] The rectification of organs directly under the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China began on June 21st and concluded in mid-August, lasting approximately fifty days. This rectification was carried out while adhering to daily work and theoretical and cultural studies. Theoretical and cultural studies were suspended for only about three weeks during the most intense period, and a portion of work time was used.

After the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the decision on rectification and the North China Bureau issued instructions on rectification, general cadres in various departments directly under the North China Bureau expressed their support, believing that rectification was in line with current needs. However, some cadres believed that they had already undergone two appraisals last spring and winter and an annual work inspection, and there was "nothing to rectify"; some felt that other places should be rectified, the lower levels should be rectified, and the organs "had no officials to be bureaucratic, no orders to give, and nothing to rectify." After rectification mobilization, explaining the purpose and method of rectification, this incorrect attitude was quickly corrected.

The rectification steps in each department were: first, using one to two weeks to study documents in a way that connected with reality, then transitioning to checking work. Generally, the focus was first on checking the overall work of the divisions and sections, explaining the work situation, identifying problems in the work, and making detailed and realistic analyses from the aspects of leadership style, work systems, and work methods; determining right and wrong, clarifying responsibilities, and then transitioning to individual-focused checks connected to the overall situation. Finally, based on the inspection results, methods for improving work were formulated.

Most Prominent and Universal Problems
Poor work quality and low efficiency. Lack of initiative and creativity among cadres.

During the work inspection, the most prominent and universal problems found in the work of various departments were: poor work quality and low efficiency. Lack of initiative and creativity among cadres. Although there had been improvements and enhancements in this regard in the past six months, they were still not keeping up with the needs of the new work situation and work tasks. This situation was caused by two factors: one was the issue of leadership style, and the other was the issue of ideological style of general cadres.

In terms of leadership style, most were busy with daily affairs, dealing with problems on a case-by-case basis, handling issues in isolation rather than systematically; leaders themselves were busy with work, with little understanding and concrete assistance to subordinates; and there was insufficient planning and strict inspection of work. In addition, the failure to appropriately improve the old organizational forms and division of labor according to the new tasks also contributed to the growth of bureaucratism.

In terms of the work style of general cadres, there was insufficient study and a lack of initiative. A few cadres even developed the old bureaucratic work style, holding the passive attitude of "doing things when there are things to do, and doing nothing when there is nothing to do" and "waiting for tasks." Ideologically, some cadres had a sense of complacency and arrogance, comparing themselves to others, calculating personal gains such as status and treatment, envying the "official positions" in government departments, and not being content with their work. Another part of the cadres who came from peasant backgrounds and worked in administrative and economic departments had negative thoughts of "no culture, no future," which affected their work enthusiasm.

During the work inspection, criticisms and self-criticisms were conducted on the above-mentioned problems in leadership style and cadre ideology, and specific improvement methods were proposed.

Basic Methods for Improving Leadership Style
Grasp the central tasks and main links Systematically Study and Handle Problems in Work

Regarding improving leadership style, the basic method should be to firmly grasp the central tasks and main links in the work. Problems that occur in the work should be systematically studied and handled. Instructions should be issued, circulars should be written, and experiences should be introduced in a planned manner; inspections should be carried out continuously, shortcomings should be corrected in a timely manner, and experiences should be summarized. As for daily problems, policy-related or common problems should be solved in a more systematic and concentrated manner to avoid handling too many fragmented issues. This can overcome the problem of bureaucratism. When studying and handling these major problems, work cadres must use the method of combining theory and practice, that is, both studying practical materials and finding theoretical bases. In this way, the policy and theoretical level and ideological ability of cadres can be improved, which can improve work quality and increase efficiency.

After serious criticism and repeated analysis in large and small meetings regarding the undesirable tendencies in the thinking of cadres, everyone realized that the non-proletarian thoughts of "complacency and arrogance" and personal calculations were invisibly eroding the progressive spirit of work cadres in politics, thus causing losses in work. Many people were determined to correct and overcome them in a timely manner.

As a result of solving the above problems, general cadres have made significant progress in work enthusiasm, work attitude, handling affairs, and abiding by rules and regulations after rectification. The leaders of various divisions and sections have generally formulated more specific work plans. For example, in the past, the division of labor in the various sections of the Propaganda Department was unclear, and when tasks came, everyone did them separately; now, according to the nature of the division of labor, specific weekly and monthly plans can be made. The enthusiasm and initiative of cadres have also been improved. They not only provide opinions to the leaders before formulating plans; in the process of completing tasks, they also constantly discuss with the leaders in a timely manner, and the relationship between superiors and subordinates is closer than in the past.

Several Basic Experiences in Rectification
The following basic experiences were gained in the rectification of various departments directly under the North China Bureau:

First: The method of firmly grasping the basic link of inspecting and summarizing work and deeply carrying out the rectification movement has proven to be completely correct. This method is to start from the actual work situation and current tasks, specifically inspect the work situation in various aspects, repeatedly observe and affirm the achievements in the work, find the main shortcomings and errors, and make realistic analysis and criticism in connection with the leadership and personal work style, attitude, thinking methods, and ideology, weigh the pros and cons, determine the responsibilities, and formulate improvement methods in a realistic manner. As long as the work is thoroughly inspected, it will inevitably be related to the things and people related to the work, and the truth of the matter can be exposed, so the criticism will be to the point, and the conclusion will be accurate and powerful.

Second: The leadership of rectification must be a combination of administrative aspects and the branch, with administrative leadership as the main focus. The leading cadres must take personal responsibility and do it themselves. Because this rectification is mainly focused on checking and summarizing the work, and focuses on the leading organs and leading cadres, it is easier for administrative responsible cadres to personally reflect and check, and lead everyone to check, to understand the situation, promote the development of the movement, and be able to grasp the main problems and seek solutions. At the same time, the direct leadership of the responsible cadres is easy to grasp and implement the rectification policy and reduce deviations.

Third: A better method of inspecting and summarizing work is the method of focusing on top-down as the main priority, closely cooperating with bottom-up, and repeated and staggered implementation. The advantage of top-down as the main priority is that it can point out the main key issues at the beginning, enlighten and guide everyone to develop in the correct direction, and avoid or reduce deviations; at the same time, it also reflects a better inspection method and leadership attitude, which is extremely important for the development of rectification. However, if there is no widespread cadre from the bottom up to check themselves and check the leadership in cooperation with the leadership's inspection, it is difficult to rectify well. Only mutual cooperation, repeated interleaving, can inspire each other, complement each other's shortcomings, and make the problem profound and comprehensive.

Fourth: Unfolding serious and realistic criticism and self-criticism is the key to whether rectification can be carried out in depth. After the start of rectification, the North China Bureau organs proposed a "gentle breeze and light rain" criticism method. This shows that checking work and rectifying thoughts is a complex and meticulous task, and simple and rough methods cannot be used, but it does not mean to weaken criticism in the slightest. Most of those who are criticized are happy to accept criticism using this method. For individual cadres who do not make humble reviews and attempt to cover up their mistakes, the criticism should be stricter, which is necessary and beneficial to warn them.

　　华北局直属机关整风结束
    检查与总结工作并订出具体改进办法整风后一般干部作风都有显著的进步
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局直属机关各部门的整风，于六月二十一日开始，八月中旬结束，历时五十天左右。这次整风，是在坚持日常工作和理论文化学习的情况下进行的，只是到最紧张的时候，才停止了三周左右的理论文化学习，占用了一部分工作时间。
    自中共中央颁布整风决定和华北局发出整风指示后，华北局直属机关各部门一般干部都表示拥护，认为整风切合当前需要，但也有部分干部认为去年已经经过春冬两次鉴定和年终工作检查，现在“无啥可整”了；有的觉得别处应整，下面应整，机关“无官可僚、无命可令，没有什么好整的”。经过整风动员，阐明整风的目的和方法后，很快地纠正了这种不正确的态度。
    各部门的整风步骤是：先以一周至二周的时间，用联系实际的方法学习文件，接着就转入检查工作。一般先以检查处、科的全面工作为主，说明工作情况，找出工作中的问题，从领导作风、工作制度、工作方法等方面作细致的实事求是的分析；判明是非，分清责任，然后再转入以个人为主联系全面的检查。最后，根据检查结果，制订改进工作的办法。
    最突出和普遍性的问题
    工作质量欠高，效率不大。干部的工作主动性创造性差。
    在工作检查中，发现各部门工作中最突出和带有普遍性的问题是：工作质量欠高，效率不大。干部的工作主动性和创造性差。半年来，在这方面虽有改进和提高，但还赶不上新的工作情势和工作任务的需要。这种情况是由两方面造成的：一方面是领导作风问题，另一方面是一般干部的思想作风问题。
    领导作风上，大多忙于日常事务，对问题就事论事，孤立地处理多，系统研究和系统处理差；领导者自己工作忙碌，对下边的了解和具体帮助少；工作计划性不够，检查不严。此外，根据新的任务适当改进旧的组织形式和分工不够，也助长了事务主义的滋长。
    一般干部作风上，表现钻研不够，主动性差，少数干部甚至滋长着旧公务员作风，抱着“有事就干，没事就算”和“等任务”的被动态度。在思想上，有一部分干部存在着居功自傲，比高低，计较地位、待遇等个人打算，眼热于政府部门的“一官半职”，不安心工作。另一部分出身农民的行政经济部门工作的干部，存在着“没文化，没前途”的消极思想，因而影响到工作的积极性。
    在工作检查中，对于上述领导作风和干部思想上的问题，进行了批评和自我批评，并提出了具体改进的办法。
    改善领导作风的基本方法
    掌握中心任务和主要环节  系统研究处理工作中的问题
    关于改善领导作风，基本的方法，应紧紧地在工作中掌握中心任务和主要环节。对于工作中所发生的问题，应系统地加以研究和处理。要有计划地发布指示、写通报、介绍经验；不断地进行检查，及时纠正缺点，总结经验。至于日常问题，凡属政策性或具有共同性的问题，要采取较系统较集中的解决办法，避免过多地处理零碎问题，这样可以克服事务主义的毛病。在研究和处理这些重大问题时，工作干部必须运用理论和实际相联系的方法，即既研究实际材料，又要找出理论根据。这样，干部的政策理论水平和思想能力提高了，就可使工作质量提高，效率增强。
    对于干部思想上的不良倾向，经过大会小会的认真批评和反复分析后，大家认识到“居功自傲”和个人打算的非无产阶级思想，有形无形地腐蚀着工作干部在政治上的前进心，因而在工作上遭受损失。很多人都决心要改正，及时加以克服。
    由于解决了上述问题，整风后一般干部在工作情绪、工作态度、处理事情和遵守制度等方面，都有显著进步。各处、科领导上已普遍订出了比较具体的工作计划。例如过去宣传部各科分工不明确，任务来了，大家分头做；现在则能依据分工的性质，定出每周、每月的具体计划。干部的积极性和主动性也提高了，不仅在制订计划前向领导提供意见；在任务完成过程中，还不断与领导及时商讨，上下级的关系，也比过去更加密切了。
    整风中的几点基本经验
    此次华北局直属机关各部门的整风，得到下面几点基本经验：
    第一：紧紧抓住检查与总结工作这个基本环节，深入开展整风运动的方法，证明是完全正确的。这方法就是从实际工作状况和当前任务出发，具体检查各方面的工作情况，经过反复观察肯定工作中的成绩，找出主要的缺点和错误，联系领导和个人的作风、态度、思想方法、思想意识等作切实的分析批判，衡量轻重，判明责任，实事求是地订出改进办法。只要切实地检查了工作，就必然会联系到工作有关的事和人，事情的真相就能裸露出来，因而批评也就切中要害，结论会确切有力。
    第二：整风的领导必须是行政方面和支部相结合，并以行政领导为主。必须首长负责亲自动手。因为此次整风既以检查和总结工作为主，且以领导机关和领导干部为重点，所以行政负责干部亲自动手，反省检查，并领导大家来检查，才易于了解情况，推动运动发展，并能很好地掌握主要问题，求得解决。同时，负责干部的直接领导，容易掌握和贯彻整风方针，减少偏差。
    第三：检查和总结工作的较好方法，是以由上而下为主为先，和自下而上密切配合，反复交错进行的方法。由上而下为主为先的好处，是一开始就能指出主要的关键问题，启示和引导大家循着正确的方向发展，避免或减少偏差；同时，也体现了较好的检查方法和领导态度，这对于整风的开展极为重要。但如果没有广大干部由下而上的检查自己，检查领导与领导上的检查相配合，也难于整好。只有相互配合、反复交错，才能互相启发、互补不足，使问题深刻而全面。
    第四：展开严肃的实事求是的批评与自我批评，是整风能否深入开展的关键。整风开始后，华北局机关曾提出“和风细雨”的批评方法。这说明检查工作、整顿思想，是一件复杂而细致的工作，不能采用简单粗糙的办法，但丝毫不是说要减弱批评。用这种方法进行批评，被批评者大多乐于接受。对个别不做虚心检讨，企图掩饰错误的干部，就要批评的严厉一些，这对警醒他们是必要的，有好处的。
