(Editorial from *The Bolshevik* Magazine)

The heroic Party of Lenin and Stalin has traversed a glorious path of struggle and victory. From small Marxist groups and circles, it has grown into the great Bolshevik Party that leads the Soviet state and guides our people in the immense creative work of building communism.

The most important source of the Bolshevik Party's growth and strength is its close and fully consolidated ties with the broadest masses of working people. The Party has achieved success in all stages of the struggle for the freedom and happiness of the people, for the independence and prosperity of our motherland, because it has always relied on the creative initiative of millions of Soviet people and constantly consolidated its ties with the masses.

Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin shattered the reactionary view of social development (according to which the masses are merely "stepping stones" for outstanding figures) and created a scientific worldview filled with boundless trust in the creative abilities of the working people. Comrade Stalin taught that the history of social development is "the history of the working people, who are the basic force of the production process and who produce the material wealth necessary for the survival of society."

The greatest strength of the Bolshevik Party lies precisely in this: based on advanced theory that reflects the demands of the development of society's material life, the Party has a correct expression of what the people are conscious of, and what millions of working people feel and experience. The most remarkable thing about the Party of Lenin and Stalin is its ability to listen to the voice of the masses, to deeply study the practice of their struggle, and to check the correctness of its policies in this practice. The Party of Lenin and Stalin not only teaches the masses but also learns from them.

As early as the initial stage of establishing the Marxist party in Russia, Lenin laid the foundation for the significance of the Party's close connection with the masses, and determined the characteristics that this connection should have. Consolidating the connection with the masses means moving forward, indicating the road, solving all the theoretical, political, and organizational problems raised in the mass movement, gradually raising the socialist consciousness of the masses, and mobilizing the masses to participate in the struggle. The Party pays special attention to ensuring that the decisions of all Party organizations are understood by the working people. Comrade Stalin taught that the Party's policies should be explained patiently because the success of the Party's policies depends on the active struggle of the broad masses to realize the policies. This view of linking the masses as the essence of the Party's leadership of the mass movement has been fully developed in the works of Lenin and Stalin and is practically embodied in the heroic activities of the Bolshevik Party.

When realizing its leadership over the masses, the Party puts forward clear goals of struggle in front of the masses, points out the road to victory, resolutely supports everything advanced that arises from the masses' practical life, and raises the backward to the level of the advanced. The Party requires all its organizations and cadres to work more skillfully among the masses and to develop the initiative and activism of the working people. The achievements our country has made in economic and cultural construction, and the truly nationwide scale of the socialist competition, prove that the Party organizations have successfully implemented the Party's instructions and have raised the broad masses of working people to struggle for the realization of these instructions.

Not long ago, the Party congresses of various districts and states pointed out that the Party organizations have further expanded their connection with the masses. The congresses cited many examples of how activists have been dramatically increasing recently, and what kinds of suggestions advanced elements and innovators—these extraordinary figures—are now making to enterprises and collective farms. Those leaders who are good at correctly organizing and guiding the high level of enthusiasm of the masses will surely reap great rewards.

Many instances with the following characteristics were cited at various congresses: the level of the leaders of the Party organization's work has improved, and the Party's political work among the masses has improved. But various congresses also reflected another aspect: they pointed out that in some cases the Party leaders are not good at utilizing the rising enthusiasm of the masses and their initiative. These leaders have not paid attention to the processes occurring in life and have not recognized the new demands placed on them in the current situation. As is well known, the Party's work among the masses cannot remain unchanged. The content and form of this work are enriched in the process of development. Bolsheviks do not regard even the concept of "masses" abstractly, but take into account concrete historical conditions.

"The concept of 'masses'," Lenin said, "is constantly changing and is adapted to the changes in the nature of the struggle... When we were in revolution, often thousands of workers represented the masses... When the revolution is fully prepared, the concept of 'masses' becomes another situation: thousands of workers can no longer constitute the masses. This word still means something else. The concept of the masses has changed in the majority of people understood, and it is not only a simple majority, but the entire exploited majority; for revolutionaries, another understanding is not permissible."

After the victory of the socialist revolution, the concept of "masses" has greatly expanded and changed in nature. Batches of new working people have been thrown into creative construction work, and millions of new figures have participated in active social and political life. In our era, when socialism has triumphed in the Soviet Union, and the Party is leading the country to develop along the road of gradual transition from socialism to communism, the masses – that is, the entire people, united by moral and political consensus, and building communism under the leadership of the Party of Lenin and Stalin.

Our Party organizations have accumulated important experience in mass work with a truly national scale. In this regard, the election movement of the Soviet of Workers' Representatives played a special role, at which time the Party organizations truly approached every working people in their propaganda and mobilization activities. However, as has been pointed out at almost all Party congresses, the scale of mass work is not done enough during the non-election movement period. In many areas, worker and collective farm member congresses are rarely convened to report on political, economic, and other issues. Residents of all strata express great concern about the international situation, the struggle for peace unfolding in various countries, and the socialist construction in the people's democratic countries. However, these questions have not always been satisfied. Party organizations also sometimes fail to consider the growing concern of the working people about the problems of Soviet domestic life and the achievements of communist construction.

Some Party committees, concentrating on the total number of reports, speeches, and talks made, often pay attention to the huge numbers, but do not pay attention to some collective farms that have not had any reports for several months, and do not pay attention to some factories in which the mass work only includes a small number of workers. And the Party organizations have enough power to carry out mass work most widely and more differentially.

During the period of transition from socialism to communism, when the growth of the communist consciousness of the masses directly affects the speed of our progress, Party organizations should regard mass political work and ideological education work as their most important task in the struggle to implement the various tasks put forward by the Party.

The matter is not only about making mass work larger, but should make the content of this work itself more profound. In the years of socialist construction, people themselves, their spiritual outlook, and their relationship to the things around them have undergone fundamental changes. Our people are not the people of yesterday, and will not be like today tomorrow. Unless one is blind, one cannot see the growth of the people, the improvement of their cultural and political level, and their enthusiasm. But can it be said that all the leaders of the local Party organizations have drawn practical conclusions for themselves based on this obvious fact? Unfortunately, no.

Mass work – is not an end in itself. Carrying out propaganda and mobilization work is to awaken the working people to active activities, improve their creative abilities, and improve their knowledge, political, and cultural level. Doing mass work – means creating conditions so that the working people can more fully and effectively contribute their abilities, experience, and initiative to the cause of building communism.

The unique characteristic of the socialist system lies in developing the abilities and talents of each person, and cultivating a creative attitude towards all public welfare undertakings.

Under capitalism, the worker becomes an appendage of the machine, and the achievements of all creative ideas become the objects of buying and selling, becoming a source of wealth for a small group of monopoly capitalists and a means of preparing for war – under this system, there is no way to talk about the creativity of the masses. Lenin wrote: "Capitalism is strangling, suppressing, and damaging the talented masses among workers and laboring peasants. These talents are destroyed under the oppression of poverty, poverty, and the trampling of human personality." Only a few people can show his creative ability in the suffocating atmosphere of the exploitation system. The philosophers hired by the bourgeoisie, attempting to erase the irreconcilable contradictions of capitalism, intentionally created various fallacies, such as describing the essence of creativity as "merely the easy inspiration of outstanding figures," "extraordinary excitement," "something irrational," and so on.

Only by eliminating capitalism can the conditions for developing the creative abilities of each person be created. The socialist system's social ownership of the means of production cultivates the feeling of the working people as the masters of the country. People's concern for increasing social wealth is growing, and all work, even the work that is known to be the most technical, is loved by people. The years of socialist construction are characterized by the continuous growth of new talents among the working masses. The cause is to turn the creative attitude towards all work into a model, into the natural and only possible attitude of the Soviet people towards labor.

And once this is the case, a new attitude is needed towards the task of leading the masses. In the current stage of the socialist competition and the Stakhanov movement, significant achievements can only be obtained by rapidly popularizing the experience of advanced elements and raising the backward elements to ensure a general upsurge. The Party's practice is accumulating more and more instances of how to organize people's creative labor and guide their growing initiative. Take the "Kalibr" factory as an example. It has become a collective Stakhanov work enterprise, where every new rationalization proposal is quickly valued. The realization of every new improvement in the factory's various departments is warmly concerned by everyone. The factory is constantly moving forward. Among the factory's entire staff, these technical engineers or Stakhanov workers are precisely planning for each unit, and they do not secretly transmit the method of improving work in their own departments. The torrent of rationalization proposals and invention applications is vast, which gives the factory huge benefits.

Naturally, all these achievements are not entirely due to the fact that there are some special people working in the "Kalibr" factory. Here, they are good at guiding, encouraging, and developing the initiative of the staff. In any Soviet enterprise, the conditions for transitioning to collective Stakhanov work have already been established, or are growing rapidly anyway. The entire cause depends on the organizers and leaders, depends on their ability to carry out mass work.

Unfortunately, there are still situations where the creative initiative of the working people encounters the obstacles of bureaucracy, indifference, and formal attitudes towards advanced plans on its path. Even in the leadership of the socialist competition—the largest mass movement of the contemporary era—there sometimes exists a formal attitude. Certain Party organizations are not as concerned about how many working people participate in the competition, what suggestions are put forward, and what difficulties are encountered, as they are about the number of contracts signed. This attitude towards competition can only be called a bureaucratic attitude—because it stifles initiative and shackles the ability and automaticity of the masses.

Certain Party organizations are doing exceptionally little to spread effective experience. It goes without saying that whoever does not actively support new and advanced things is hindering progress. A leader who is not good at paying attention to and supporting new and advanced things in a timely manner—in fact, cannot be regarded as a leader who understands the meaning of the word Bolshevik.

The recent actions of the Party Committee of the Kursk Oblast can be regarded as a beneficial lesson. Everyone knows what kind of results the previous leaders of the Kursk Oblast Party organization brought about because they did not understand that labor in collective farm production should be organized. The leaders of Kursk, not paying attention to new and advanced things, not studying and analyzing the actual situation of collective farms, made a great mistake by replacing the production team in the collective farm with isolated groups, and thereby prevented the large-scale adoption of machine technology in agriculture. In particular, when discussing these mistakes in the Oblast Party organization, some facts were exposed, proving that the Oblast Committee's connection with the masses was terrible, and proving that the Oblast Committee was not good at relying on those advanced elements in the collective farm. It was by no means accidental that the Oblast Committee paid almost no attention to the political work in the tractor station and tractor team, and embarked on the incorrect path of establishing rural Party organizations in the region to replace the production collective farm Party organizations. This weakened the Party's political work in the collective farm.

What happened in the Kursk Oblast should be taken as a serious lesson for all Party organizations, and should be repeatedly remembered: leading the masses in the Bolshevik way – means deciding the direction towards the advanced instead of towards the backward, and being good at discovering the advanced things and using the full authority of the Party organization to support it.

The growth of the masses' enthusiasm and their desire to clear the way for new and advanced things is one of the most significant manifestations. The flood of letters that the Party and Soviet organs receive from workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals is one of the most significant manifestations. Only a rigid bureaucrat can regard these letters as personal complaints from meddling petitioners. In fact, the letters sent by the Soviet people to the Party or Soviet organs, even if they contain personal complaints – this is first and foremost a document proving their ardent desire to help correct shortcomings and improve work. The letters received by the Party and Soviet organs are diverse in content: reports on the patriotic initiatives of advanced elements in production, and warnings about the poor work and bureaucracy in individual departments.

The Party organization's attitude towards the letters of the working people is a reliable indicator of the degree of its connection with the masses, whether it listens to the voices of the masses, and how it answers the needs and questions of the masses. It was pointed out at the congress that recently many Party committees have somewhat improved the work of handling letters, and are supervising the handling of letters or appeals in the Soviet and economic organs, and are exposing the responsibility of bureaucrats for taking an indifferent attitude towards letters. But in many cases, the answers to the letters of the working people are of a vague and irrelevant nature. In many organs, there are still some staff members who do not try to handle the letters of the working people, but simply forward these letters to another level of the organ in their original form.

The Party Committee should delve into the content of the letters of the working people, and strive to make the leaders handle the letters in all organizations and organs, rather than secondary staff members. In short, the Party organization itself must be good at discovering those problems with major principled significance and requiring decisions suitable for the Party, based on the voices and appeals of the working people. Obviously, there are not a few examples of extremely important Party resolutions and regulations of state organs that originate from the letters and appeals of ordinary staff members.

The political maturity of the Party's leaders, the sense of freshness, and the ability to lead the masses are mainly manifested in how he can grasp the main problems in the complex daily work and focus the attention of the Party organization on this aspect. At the congress, some staff members were severely criticized for being immersed in trivial affairs and letting go of major issues related to the future. Why are those leaders (whose responsibility should be to guide the masses forward) often limited to today and cannot see the future? The criticism and self-criticism展开 at the Party congress gave a complete answer to this question: pay more attention to the Party's work methods and methods.

The strength of the Party's leadership also lies in this: after putting forward the general guidelines, the majority of Soviet and social organizations should be made to effectively implement the decisions of the Party and the government, and mobilize the broad masses to carry out an active struggle to realize these decisions, and organize an inspection of the implementation of these decisions. However, some Party committees, instead of directly leading economic affairs as Comrade Stalin taught, are doing everything through the Soviet and economic organs, turning the Party organs into some kind of all-encompassing and omnipotent organ. These Party committees do not work in conjunction with activists, do not rely on grassroots organizations, and mobilize the broad masses of working people, but would rather operate with the help of a small group of staff members. The congress cited some convincing examples, proving that this bad action has an extremely adverse impact on the economy and weakens the connection between the Party organization and the masses.

The following task was sharply put forward at all congresses: improve the Party's leadership methods and methods. According to the Constitution of the Communist Party of China (Bolshevik), the role of grassroots Party organizations should be improved, and the masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals should be linked to the Party's leading organs. The closer the grassroots organizations are to the masses, the faster they will know the needs and requests of the masses, and know the new initiatives generated in factories and collective farm production teams. The Party's leading organs should also carry out mass work through grassroots organizations.

With the help of the mass organizations – the flexible branches of Soviets at all levels, trade unions, communist youth leagues, etc., the Party organizations are able to connect more closely with the working people. The Party organization is the leading core of all these organizations, and has the responsibility to resolutely fight to improve their activities. Therefore, the instructions of the Party organs must be well-thought-out and must avoid biases that may occur during implementation. Some Party leaders always fail to pay attention to how great the prestige of the Party's organs is for all national and social organizations, and fail to pay attention to what kind of results may be caused by errors made in the Party's instructions. The Party Committee must be responsible not only for the decisions it makes, but also for the results of the decisions.

The biggest shortcomings in the work of several district committees, municipal committees, and state committees are that they have relaxed their leadership over the Soviet organs. The delegates to the state Party congresses justly accused the Pingzi State Committee of the Communist Party of China (Bolshevik) and its departments of failing to lead the activities of the state's organizations and attempting to replace their work. Some district committees repeated this incorrect action of the state committee. They attempted to decide all economic issues themselves, removing the district Soviet executive committee and other district organizations from the responsibility of completing their direct tasks, and not caring about the new activists growing up around the Soviet organs. Resolutely improving the leadership of the Soviet, fully utilizing the great strength of these capable labor mass organizations, to further consolidate the connection with the workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals, and mobilizing them to solve economic and political tasks – is an extremely important cause for all Party organizations. The Soviet must, especially the lower-level Soviets – the village, township, district, and municipal Soviets – unite broader masses around themselves, and attract them to participate in the work of their various departments and standing committees.

The mission of the Party organization is to help the trade union, guide its work, and improve its role in the communist education of the working people, in the development of the socialist competition, and in the production life of the enterprise. In the work of the trade union organs, it is necessary to overcome bureaucratic factors, overcome the attitude of indifference towards the working people, and overcome the violation of trade union democracy. At the various Party congresses, these trade union staff members were sharply criticized for forgetting their responsibility to the trade union members, arbitrarily making decisions, and thinking that they could not be criticized. Some trade union staff members did not fight to implement collective contracts and to improve labor conditions and the material living conditions of the workers. At the various congresses, facts were cited, proving the insufficient leadership of the trade union organizations; the Party committees should strengthen the leadership of the trade union organs, and improve the sense of responsibility of the Communist Party members – the trade union staff members – to the masses, requiring them to have a sensitive and sympathetic attitude towards the needs and requests of the trade union members.

The Party should pay more attention to the work of the Communist Youth League, and regard it as a mass organization responsible for helping to educate the younger generation with communism. However, due to the lack of leadership from the Party Committee, some Communist Youth League organizations have not fulfilled their tasks well. In many collective farms and in many enterprises, the Communist Youth League organizations have united only a small part of the youth, they are few in number and weak in strength. The setting of the work of the various Communist Youth League organizations often does not take into account the age characteristics of the youth, and has not taken on the responsibility for the youth's increasing ideological questions and the determination to serve the cause of the Party and the Soviet motherland. The Party organization must focus the attention of the Communist Youth League on the task of educating the youth, on the task of guiding them to carry out political study and participate in active social and productive life.

The Party must always rely on the vast activists of the non-Party working masses. "Without the help of these activists," Comrade Stalin pointed out, "the Party cannot realize the leadership of millions of people. This is one of the basic laws of leadership." It is necessary to increase the ranks of activists, educate them politically, and rely more on them in their work.

The Party and Soviet leading staff members should personally participate in mass work, attend meetings of workers and collective farm members, and present reports on the various decisions of the Party and the government, and reports on the current tasks of the state, city, and district. Regularly consult with the masses, know their questions and interests, needs and emotions – this is the most important requirement for a Bolshevik leader.

The successful resolution of the tasks of economic and cultural construction depends first and foremost on the level of the Party's leadership, and on the Party organization's political and organizational work among the masses. Comrade Stalin pointed out that the strength and invincibility of the Bolshevik leadership lies in connecting with the masses, consolidating this connection, and listening to the voices of the masses at all times:

"Correct leadership – means:

First, correctly decide the problem, and it is impossible to correctly decide the problem without considering the experience of the masses.

Second, organize the implementation of this correct decision. However, it is impossible to do this without the direct assistance of the masses.

Third, organize the inspection of the implementation of this decision. However, it is also impossible to do this without the direct assistance of the masses."

The working people are accumulating a lot of practical experience, and using this experience, it is possible to realize the creative leadership of communist construction. In order to learn and use the experience of the masses to further improve all our work, the Party resolutely developed criticism and self-criticism.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (Bolshevik) wrote in its appeal to all voters: "The Party requires all Party and non-Party comrades to boldly expose the shortcomings in our work and point out the ways to overcome these shortcomings. The Party will take it as its task to support and develop beneficial criticism of the work of the Soviet and economic organs, and take all countermeasures to overcome the shortcomings revealed."

The Party is resolutely fighting against all attempts to suppress criticism and self-criticism, and regards those staff members who are unwilling to pay attention to criticism from below as bureaucrats who spread anti-Party styles and undermine the Party's leadership prestige.

Constantly strengthening and consolidating the connection with the masses – this is one of the basic organizational principles of the Bolshevik Party. Comrades Lenin and Stalin taught that the Communist Party is the embodiment of the connection between the advanced ranks of the working class and the millions of working masses, and the breadth of historical influence and the depth of revolutionary transformation depend directly on attracting millions of working masses to consciously participate in these transformations. Lenin pointed out: "The reason for our victory is that our Party and the Soviet regime directly issued instructions to the working masses on all current difficulties and current tasks; they were good at explaining to the masses why, in this or that situation, they must put all their efforts sometimes on this aspect of Soviet work and sometimes on that aspect; they were good at improving the ability, heroism, and enthusiasm of the masses, and concentrating the revolutionary energy on the most important task at hand."

The Party's work aims to improve the combat effectiveness of the Party organizations, strengthen the Party's influence among the masses, and inspire millions of working masses to participate in active political and productive life in batches. In order to strive for the early completion of the 1950 national economic plan, and in order to strive for new achievements in industry and agriculture, the socialist competition should be widely carried out.

When summing up the experience of the Bolshevik Party, Comrade Stalin ingeniously developed Lenin's theory on the art of political leadership of the masses. Resolutely following the instructions of the great Stalin, mastering the working methods of Lenin and Stalin, the Party is developing and consolidating its connection with the masses, and is achieving ever-increasing achievements in the struggle to build communism.

　　与群众密切联系是党的领导力量的源泉
    （《布尔什维克》杂志社论）
    列宁——斯大林英勇的党，已经历了斗争和胜利的光荣途程。她由不大的马克思主义团体和小组，已成长为领导苏维埃国家、领导我们人民从事建设共产主义之巨大创造工作的伟大的布尔什维克党。
    布尔什维克党的成长和力量之最重要的源泉，是她与最广大的劳动群众之密切的和完全巩固的联系。在争取人民的自由和幸福、争取我们祖国的独立和繁荣而斗争的一切阶段上，党所以获得成就，是因为她永远依靠千百万苏维埃人民之创造的积极性，不断巩固自己与群众之间的联系。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林粉碎了关于社会发展的反动观点之后（按照这个观点群众是只能当作卓越人物的“踏脚石”），创造了对劳动人民的创造能力充满无限信任的科学世界观。斯大林同志教导说：社会发展的历史，是“劳动人民的历史，他们是生产过程的基本力量，他们生产了为社会生存所必须的物质财富”。
    布尔什维克党最伟大的力量，正是在于：根据着反映社会物质生活发展要求的先进理论，党对人民所觉悟到的、对千百万劳动人民所感觉到和体会到的东西，有着正确的表示。列宁——斯大林的党最卓越的地方就是善于倾听群众的呼声，深刻地研究他们斗争的实践，在这个实践上检查自己政策的正确性。列宁——斯大林的党不只是教导群众，而且要向群众学习。
    还在俄国建立马克思主义政党的初期，列宁就已经奠立了党与群众紧密联系的意义，并确定了这种联系应具的特征。巩固与群众之间的联系——这就是说：向前进，指示道路，解决群众运动中所提出之一切理论的、政策的和组织的问题，逐步提高群众社会主义意识，动员群众参加斗争。党特别重视的一点是，一切党组织的决定，应为劳动人民所理解。斯大林同志教导说，应耐心地解释党的政策，因为党的政策的成功，有赖于广大群众为实现政策而进行的积极的斗争。这样将联系群众作为党对群众运动领导的实质的观点，在列宁和斯大林的著作中获得了全面的发展，并实际体现在布尔什维克党的英勇活动中。
    党在实现对群众的领导的时候，在群众面前提出了鲜明的斗争目标，指明走向胜利的道路，坚决支持群众生活实践中所产生的一切先进的东西，把落后的提高到先进的水准。党要求她的一切组织和干部，更加熟练地在群众中进行工作，发展劳动人民的积极性和主动性。我国在经济建设和文化建设中所达到的成就，及那在社会主义竞赛中所获得的真正全民的规模，证明各党组织顺利实现了党的指示，将广大劳动群众提高到为实现这些指示而斗争。
    不久以前，各区的和各州的党代表会议曾指出，各党组织已进一步扩大了自己与群众的联系。代表会议上曾引证许多实例，如近来积极分子是在如何激剧地增加着，先进分子、革新者——这些非凡的人物，现在对企业和集体农庄提出了一些什么样的意见。那些善于正确地组织和指引群众高度积极性的领导者们，一定会得到巨大的收获。
    在各个代表会议上曾引证许多具有下列特征的实例：党组织工作领导者们的水准提高了，在群众中党的政治工作改善了。但各个代表会议也反映了另一方面：他们指出，在若干情况下党的领导者们不善于运用群众高涨着的积极性和他们的主动性。这种领导者们没有去注意生活中所发生的那些过程，没有认识到在当前的情况下向他们所提出的那些新的要求。如众所周知，党在群众中的工作是不能一成不变的。这个工作的内容和形式，是在发展的过程中丰富起来的。布尔什维克，即使对“群众”本身的观念，也不是去抽象地看待，而要考虑到具体的历史条件的。
    “‘群众’观念，”——列宁说，“是时常变化的，是与斗争性质的变化相适应的………当我们革命时，常常是数千工人就代表了群众………当革命已有充分准备时，“群众”观念就变成另外一种情况：数千工人已经不能再构成群众。这个字还意味着另外的某种意思。群众观念在人们所理解的多数上，意思是有变化的，而且也不仅是简单的多数，而是整个被剥削的多数；对于革命者，别种理解是不能容许的。”
    社会主义革命胜利之后，“群众”观念有了很大程度上的扩展和性质上的变化。一批一批新的劳动人民投入到创造性的建设工作中，千百万新的人物参加到积极的社会生活和政治生活中。在我们这时代，当社会主义已在苏联胜利，而党正领导着国家、沿着由社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的道路发展时，群众——那即是全体人民，由道德上政治上一致团结起来的人民，在列宁——斯大林党领导之下建设着共产主义的人民。
    我们的党组织，已经积累了具有真正全民规模的群众工作的重要经验。在这一方面，劳动者代表苏维埃的选举运动，起了特别的作用，这时党组织在其宣传鼓动的活动上真正接近了每个劳动人民。然而，正如在差不多所有党代表会议上所曾指出的，群众工作的规模在非竞选运动时期还是做得不够。在许多地区，很少召集工人和集体农庄庄员大会，来作政治、经济和其他问题的报告。各阶层的居民表示很关心国际形势，很关心在各国所展开的争取和平的斗争和人民民主国家中的社会主义建设。但是，这些问题总没有得到满足。对于劳动人民对苏维埃国内生活问题、对共产主义建设成绩之日益增长的关心，党组织也有时不加考虑。
    一些党委会，专心致志所做的报告、讲演、和谈话的总数字，却常常为了巨大的数字，不去注意一些已经数月没有任何报告的集体农庄，不去注意一些在其中的群众工作只是包括了一小部分工人的工厂。而党组织是有足够的力量，最广泛地和较有区别地来进行群众工作的。
    在由社会主义过渡到共产主义的期间，当群众之共产主义自觉的成长，直接地影响到我们前进的速度时，各党组织应该将群众政治工作、思想教育工作，当作自己在为执行党所提出的各项任务的斗争中的最首要的任务。
    事情不仅在于使群众工作获得更大的规模，而应使这件工作本身的内容成为更加深刻。在社会主义建设的年份里，人们自己、他们的精神面貌、他们对周围事物的关系，已有了根本的改变。我们的人民已经不是昨天的人民，而明天也将不会像今天这样。除非一个瞎子，才看不见人民的成长，他们文化水准和政治水准以及他们积极性的提高。但能否说：地方党组织的所有领导者们，根据这个显然的事实给自己做出了实际的结论呢？可惜没有。
    群众工作——本身不是目的。进行宣传鼓动工作是为了唤醒劳动人民去积极活动，提高他们的创造能力，提高他们的知识、政治和文化水准。做群众工作——是意味着创造条件，以便劳动人民能够更充分更有效地贡献出自己的能力、经验与对建设共产主义事业的主动性。
    社会主义制度之特有的特征，在于发展每个人的能力和天才，培养对一切公益事业之创造的态度。
    在资本主义下，工人变成了机器的附属品，而一切创造性思想的成就变成了买卖的对象，变成了一小群垄断资本家们致富的源泉和备战的手段，——在这种制度下，是不能谈到什么群众的创造性的。列宁写道：“资本主义是在绞杀、压制、损害着工人和劳动农民中的有天才的群众。这些天才毁灭在困苦、贫穷以及对人类个性的凌辱这些压迫的下面。”仅只少数人在剥削制度窒息的气氛中，能够显示出他的创造能力。资产阶级雇佣的哲学家们，企图抹杀资本主义之不可调和的矛盾，有意地制造了各种谬论，诸如把创造力的实质描写做“仅是优异人物的轻易的灵感”、“不平凡的激动”、“某种非理性的东西”等等。
    只有消灭了资本主义，才能创造出发挥每个人创造能力的条件。社会主义制度生产手段的社会所有制，养成了劳动人民之作为国家主人翁的感觉。人们对增加社会财富的关心在增长着，而一切工作，甚至一看便知道是最带技术性的工作，都为人们所热爱。社会主义建设的年份，是以劳动群众中新的天才之不断增长为其特征的。事业是在把对一切工作的创造态度变为模范，变为苏维埃人对劳动之自然的和唯一可能的态度。
    而一经如此，对领导群众的任务，便需要有一种新的态度。在社会主义竞赛和斯达汉诺夫运动的现阶段中，只有经由迅速普及先进分子的经验和提高落后分子以保证一般的高涨，才能获得重大的成就。党的实践积累着逐渐增多的实例，即现在应该怎样去组织人们创造性的劳动，引导他们增长着的主动性。兹举“卡里布尔”工厂为例。它已成为集体的斯达汉诺夫工作的企业，这里每一个新的合理化的建议，都迅速受到了重视。在厂内各部实现每一个新的改进，都为大家所热烈关切。工厂是在不断的前进着。在工厂全体人员中，这些技术工程人员们或斯达汉诺夫工人们是在精确地为各个单位打算，他们不把那一种改善工作的方法秘传在自己的部门里。合理化建议和发明申请书的洪流是浩大的，这给工厂以巨大的成效。
    自然，所有这些成就，完全不是由于“卡里布尔”工厂中有某种特别人物在工作。这里善于引导、鼓舞和发展工作人员的主动性。在任何一个苏维埃的企业中，过渡到集体的斯达汉诺夫工作的条件，是业已具备了，或者无论如何是在迅速成长着。全部事业有赖于组织者和领导者们，有赖于他们善于进行群众工作。
    可惜，还有这种情况，即劳动人民的创造主动性，在自己的道路上碰到了官僚主义、漠视、对先进计划采取形式的态度的阻壁。甚至在社会主义竞赛——这个当代最大的群众性运动——的领导上有时也存在着形式的态度。某些党组织之关心有多少劳动人民参加竞赛，提出些什么建议，遇到些什么困难，并不如关心缔结合同的数量那样郑重。对竞赛的这种态度，只能称为官僚主义的态度——因为它窒息了主动性，束缚了群众的能力和自动性。
    某些党组织，对传播有效经验是作得异常不够的。无须证明，谁不积极支持新的先进的东西，那就是阻碍前进。不善于及时注意和支持新的先进东西的领导者——实际上，不能算是对布尔什维克这个字有所理解的领导者。
    党的库尔斯克州委会最近的举动，可以当作有益的教训。大家知道，库尔斯克州党组织以前的领导者们，为了不理解集体农庄生产中的劳动应该是有组织的，是招致了什么样的结果。库尔斯克的领导者们，不去注意新的先进的东西，不去研究分析集体农庄的实际情况，犯下了极大的错误，用孤立的小组来代替集体农庄中的生产队，并由此阻止更大量地在农业中采用大规模的机器技术。特别是，在本州党组织中讨论这些错误时，暴露了一些事实，证明着州委会与群众的联系是糟糕的，证明着州委会不善于依靠集体农庄中的那些先进分子。绝非偶然，州委会几乎没有去注意拖拉机站和拖拉机队中的政治工作，走上了不正确的、建立地区的农村党组织以代替生产的集体农庄党组织的道路。这就削弱了集体农庄中党的政治工作。
    库尔斯克州所发生的这件事，对于一切党组织来说，应当引为严重的教训，要一再记起：按照布尔什维克的方式领导群众——就是朝着先进的而不是朝着落后的东西来决定方向，要善于发现先进的东西，用党组织的全部威权去支持它。
    群众积极性的增长，他们为新的先进的东西扫清道路的愿望，其显著表现之一，就是党和苏维埃的机关从工人、集体农庄庄员和知识分子中间所得到的洪流一般的信件。只是僵化了的官僚分子，才能把这些信件看做冒渎的请求者的个人牢骚。实际上，苏维埃人民寄给党或苏维埃机关的信件，即使带有个人牢骚，——这首先也是一种证明着热烈希望帮助矫正缺点和改善工作的文件。党和苏维埃机关所收到的信件，内容是多样的：关于生产上的先进分子们的爱国主义创举的报道，关于个别部门工作恶劣及官僚主义等等事实的警惕。
    党组织对劳动人民信件的态度——是她与群众联系的程度，是否倾听群众的呼声，并怎样答复群众的需要和质问的可靠指标。在代表会议上曾指出，近来许多党委会多少改进了处理信件的工作，并在监督着苏维埃机关和经济机关中对信件或声诉的处理情况，在检举着官僚分子们对信件采取漠视态度的责任。但有不少时候，对劳动人民信件的答复，带着空泛不着边际的性质。在许多机关中还有些工作人员不去设法处理劳动人民的信件，而只是把这些信件原封转给某个另外一级的机关。
    党委会应当深究劳动人民信件的内容，力求使一切组织和机关中处理信件的是领导者，而非次要的工作人员。总之须使党组织本身，善于根据劳动人民的呼声和声诉，发现具有重大原则性的意义的和要求适合于党的决定的那些问题。显然，极其重要的全党的决议，国家机关的规定，其根源乃是平常的工作人员的信件和呼声，这种例子是不在少数。
    党的领导者政治上的成熟、对新鲜事物的感觉、与善于领导群众，主要是表现于他在繁复的日常工作中，如何能抓到主要的问题，并把党组织的注意力集中在这一方面。在代表会议上，一些工作人员曾受到严重的批评，他们沉没在琐碎的事务里，放过了关系前途的重大问题。到底那些领导者们（他们的责任应该是引导群众前进的）为什么常常局限于今天，而看不到将来呢？在党代表会议上展开的批评与自我批评，对这个问题给了圆满的答复：要更加重视党的工作方式和方法。
    党的领导的力量还在于：在提出总方针后，要使苏维埃和社会的大多数组织，来切实执行党和政府的决定，发动广大群众为实现这些决定而进行积极的斗争，有组织的检查这些决定的执行情况。但是某些党委会，不是如斯大林同志所教导的，来直接领导经济事业，而是通过苏维埃和经济机关包办一切，把党的机关变成某种包罗万象无所不能的机关。这些党委会不去结合积极分子进行工作，不去依靠基层组织和发动广大劳动群众，而宁愿在一小组工作人员的帮助下来活动。代表会议上引证了一些使人信服的实例，证明这种恶劣的行动，在经济中发生极不良好的影响，削弱了党组织与群众之间的联系。
    在所有代表会议上很尖锐地提出了下列任务，改善党的领导的方法和方式。根据联共（布）党章提高基层党组织的作用，使工人、农民和知识分子群众与党的领导机关联系起来，基层组织愈是接近群众，它就会愈快地知道群众的需要和请求，知道在工厂和集体农庄生产队中产生的新的创举。党的领导机关进行群众工作，也正应该通过基层组织。
    在群众性组织——各级苏维埃、职工会、共产主义青年团等等灵活的分支机关的帮助之下，党组织是有可能与劳动人民更加紧密地联系起来的。党组织乃是所有这些组织的领导核心，并有为改善他们的活动而坚决斗争的责任。因此，党机关的指示必须是经过深思熟虑的，必须避免实现时可能发生的偏向。某些党的领导者，总是不注意现在党的各机关对所有国家的和社会的组织具有如何巨大的威信，不注意党的指令中所作的错误将可能引起怎样的结果。党的委员会不仅要对他所采取的决定负责，而且要对决定实行的结果负责。
    若干区委会、市委会、州委会工作上最大的缺点，就是他们放松了对苏维埃机关的领导。州的党代表会议的代表们关于这一点曾公正地责备了联共（布）平兹州委会及其各部，没有去领导州的各组织的活动，而企图代替他们工作。某些区委会重复了州委会这种不正确的行动。他们企图自己决定所有的经济问题，摘除区苏维埃执行委员会和其他区组织对完成他们直接任务的责任，不去关心围绕着苏维埃机关成长起来的新的积极分子。坚决改进苏维埃的领导，充分运用这些有能力的劳动群众组织的伟大力量，以进一步巩固与工人、集体农庄庄员和知识分子的联系，并动员他们来解决经济政治任务——是各个党组织极端重要的事业。必须使苏维埃，特别是下层的——各村的、各乡的、各区的和各市的苏维埃——把更广大的群众团结在自己周围，吸引他们参加自己各部门和各种常设委员会的工作。
    党组织的使命是帮助职工会，指导它们的工作，在对劳动人民的共产主义教育上，在发展社会主义竞赛上、与在企业的生产生活上，提高它们的作用。在职工会各机关的工作中，须要克服官僚主义因素，克服对劳动人民漠不关心的态度，克服对职工会民主的侵犯。在各党代表会议上，这些职工会工作人员曾受到尖锐的批评，他们忘记了对职工会会员的责任，专横地作出决定，认为自己可以不受批评。某些职工会工作人员没有为执行集体合同、为改善劳动条件和工人们的物质生活状况来作斗争。在各代表会议上，曾列举事实，证明对各职工会组织领导的不充分；各党委会应加强对职工会机关的领导，提高共产党员——职工会工作人员——对群众的责任心，要求他们对职工会会员的需要和请求有一种敏感和同情。
    党应加重注意共青团的工作，把它当作有责任帮助以共产主义教育青年一代的群众性组织。然而由于党委会方面领导的不够，某些共青团组织把自己的任务没有执行好。在许多集体农庄以及许多企业中，共青团组织团结了很少的一部分青年，他们人数不多而且力量薄弱。各共青团组织的工作的设定，常常不考虑青年之年龄上的特质，未对青年日益增多的思想上的疑问和竭诚为党的事业和苏维埃祖国服务的志愿，负担起责任。党组织必须集中共青团的注意力在教育青年的任务上，在引导他们进行政治学习、参加积极的社会生活和生产生活的任务上。
    党要经常依靠非党的劳动群众的广大积极分子。“没有这种积极分子的帮助，——斯大林同志指出，——党是不可能实现对千百万人民群众的领导的。这是领导的基本法则之一”。必须增加积极分子的队伍，在政治上教育他们，在工作中更加依靠他们。
    党和苏维埃的领导工作人员，应亲身参加群众工作，出席工人和集体农庄庄员的会议，提出有关党和政府的各种决定的报告，有关州、市、区当前任务的报告。经常与群众商量，知道他们的疑问和兴趣，需要和情绪——这对于布尔什维克的领导者是一个最重要的要求。
    顺利解决经济和文化建设的任务，首先有赖于党的领导水准，有赖于党组织在群众中的政治工作和组织工作。斯大林同志指出，布尔什维克领导的力量和不可战胜性，就在于与群众联系，巩固这个联系，随时倾听群众的呼声：
    “正确的领导，——这就是说：
    首先，正确的决定问题，而正确的决定问题，不考虑到群众经验是不可能的。
    其次，组织这个正确决定的执行。然而，没有群众方面的直接帮助，是办不到的。
    第三，组织对这个决定执行情形的检查。可是，没有群众直接的帮助，同样也是不能办到的。”
    劳动人民积累着很多的实际经验，利用这些经验，就可以实现对共产主义建设之创造性的领导。为了学习和运用群众的经验以进一步改进我们的一切工作，党坚决地发展了批评与自我批评。
    联共（布）中央委员会在它的告全体选民书中曾写道：“党要求一切党和非党的同志，大胆地揭发我们工作中的缺点和指出克服这些缺点的途径。党要把支持和发展对苏维埃和经济机关工作之有益的批评，采取一切对策以克服所揭发的缺点，作为自己的任务。”
    党坚决地与压制批评与自我批评的一切企图进行着斗争，对于那些不愿重视下面来的批评意见的工作人员，看做传布反党作风，破坏党的领导威信的官僚分子。
    经常增强和巩固与群众的联系——这是布尔什维克党基本的组织原则之一。列宁和斯大林同志教导说：共产党就是工人阶级的先进队伍与千百万劳动群众联系的化身，历史影响的幅度和革命改造的深度，直接有赖于吸引千百万劳动群众来自觉地参加这些改造。列宁曾指出：“我们胜利的原因是：我们的党和苏维埃政权，对一切当前的困难和当前的任务，直接向劳动群众发布了指示；善于向群众解释为什么在这个或那个情况下，须要把全付力量时而放在苏维埃工作的这一方面，时而放在那一方面；善于提高群众的能力、英雄主义和热情，把革命紧张的精力集中在当前最重要的任务上。”
    党的工作旨在提高党组织的战斗力，加强党在群众中的影响，鼓舞千百万劳动群众一批一批不断地参加积极的政治生活和生产生活。为争取提前完成一九五○年国民经济计划，为争取工业和农业的新成就，尚须广泛地展开社会主义竞赛。
    斯大林同志在总结布尔什维克党的经验时，天才的发展了列宁关于群众之政治领导的艺术的原理。坚决地遵循伟大斯大林的指示，掌握列宁斯大林的工作方式，党发展着和巩固着自己与群众的联系，在建设共产主义的斗争中正获致日新月异的成就。
