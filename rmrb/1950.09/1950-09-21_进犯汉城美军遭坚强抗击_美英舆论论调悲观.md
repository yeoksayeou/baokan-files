Xinhua News Agency, September 20th: U.S. troops invading Korea in an attempt to salvage their failing fortunes, having landed at Incheon and advancing towards Seoul, are now encountering staunch resistance from the Korean People's Army. Incheon is only 30 kilometers from Seoul, and the U.S. military has been ashore for five or six days, yet their two-pronged force is still blocked on the south bank of the Han River. According to a United Press report from Tokyo on the 19th, both invading armies are encountering "increasingly stiff resistance" in their advance. Agence France-Presse in Tokyo also reported on the 18th that the strength of the People's Army defending Seoul "has been greatly strengthened." After returning to Tokyo from Incheon, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Moorehouse said, "There may be more fierce battles ahead."

The United States' desperate gamble not only scraped together all American forces in the Far East, except those on the Busan and Daegu fronts, but also pieced together the Syngman Rhee puppet army and American units, as well as some ships from Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, the Netherlands, and other countries. Half of the U.S. 7th Division that landed at Incheon was composed of Syngman Rhee puppet troops who had only recently been trained in Japan. Moreover, according to sources close to the U.S. Navy Department, many of the fifty landing craft used by the United States during the Incheon landing had Japanese sailors.

Despite this, some reactionary American and British public opinion is not so confident in this military adventure by the American aggressors. Associated Press correspondent Bagwell, stationed in Korea, reported on the 15th: "The Incheon landing is one of the large-scale, carefully prepared military gambles. It may quickly end the war, or it may cause a long-term, cold stalemate." An American "observer" in Tokyo quickly responded to the dream of ending the war quickly. According to an Associated Press report from Tokyo on the 18th, "Tokyo observers believe that the eye-catching Incheon landing will not have a decisive effect on the entire war." The observer admitted that the Korean People's Army "outnumbers the 'United Nations forces' in Incheon and the southeastern defense perimeter." At the same time, reactionary British newspapers also issued pessimistic tones. The military correspondent of the Conservative Party newspaper *The Times* wrote: "Public sentiment may have turned from excessive pessimism to excessive optimism. Now the U.S. military is far apart, and there will be hard fighting ahead of them." Agence France-Presse, London, September 17th.

### 进犯汉城美军遭坚强抗击  美英舆论论调悲观

　　进犯汉城美军遭坚强抗击
    美英舆论论调悲观
    【新华社二十日讯】为挽救其失败命运而在仁川登陆并向汉城进犯的侵朝美军，现正遭遇朝鲜人民军的坚强抗击。仁川距汉城仅三十公里，美军登陆为时已达五六天，其两路部队现仍被阻于汉江南岸。据合众社东京十九日电承认：两路侵略军在推进中均“遭遇到愈来愈坚强的抵抗”。法新社东京十八日电也认为人民军保卫汉城的力量，“已加强许多”。美国海军中将穆尔浩斯从仁川回到东京以后说：“以后也许还有恶战”。
    美国此次孤注一掷的冒险行动，不仅搜罗了除釜山、大邱前线以外的远东的所有美国兵力，而且还拚凑了李承晚伪军和美国部队，以及加、澳、新西兰、法、荷等国的一些船只。在仁川登陆的美军第七师中，有一半是在日本训练不久的李承晚伪军。而且据接近美国海军部人士谈称：美国在仁川登陆时使用的五十艘登陆艇中大都有日本水手。
    尽管这样，一些美、英反动舆论对美国侵略者这次军事冒险的信心并不那么高。美联社驻朝鲜记者包义尔十五日报道说：“仁川登陆是大规模的仔细准备过的军事赌博之一，它可能很快地使战争结束，或者会引起一个长期的冷酷的僵持”。而在东京的美国“观察家”很快就回答了可能很快结束战争的梦想。据美联社东京十八日电称：“东京观察家相信：惹人注意的仁川登陆，并不能对整个战争发生决定性的作用”。该观察家承认朝鲜人民军“比起仁川与东南防御方阵的‘联合国部队’的数目还要超过”。同时，英国反动报纸也发出了悲观论调。保守党报纸《泰晤士报》的军事记者写道：“人们的情绪可能已从过分的悲观转到过分的乐观。现在美军正被远远地分隔开，在他们的面前还要有艰苦的战斗”。【法新社伦敦十七日电】
