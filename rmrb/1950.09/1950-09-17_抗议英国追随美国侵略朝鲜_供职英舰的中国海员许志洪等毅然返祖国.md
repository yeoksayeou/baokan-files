Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th: Chinese seamen, including Xu Zhihong, who were employed on British aircraft carriers, resolutely left their British ships and returned to the motherland in protest against Britain's following of the United States in launching a war of aggression against Korea. Xu Zhihong originally worked as a bartender on the British aircraft carrier "Unicorn." After the outbreak of the American war of aggression against Korea at the end of June, the ship was loaded with artillery shells, bullets and planes and sailed from Singapore to Japan. At that time, the Chinese seamen on board expressed their opposition. Xu Zhihong said to everyone: These artillery shells and bullets are being transported to slaughter the Korean people. The American imperialist aggression against Korea is a criminal act that destroys world peace, and Chinese workers must resolutely oppose it. When the ship arrived at Sasebo Naval Base in Japan, Xu Zhihong even initiated a joint signature protest with Chinese employees on another British ship, the "Triumph." They wrote in the protest letter: "We are here to work, not to carry bullets, nor to participate in the war." At the same time, representatives were sent to negotiate with the British officers of the two ships. However, their just demands were unreasonably rejected by the British naval officers of the two ships, and they were demoted and prohibited from going ashore. Xu Zhihong and fifty-seven other Chinese employees insisted on their anti-aggression stance and resigned to return to Hong Kong. After arriving in Hong Kong, Xu Zhihong and three other sailors resolutely returned to the motherland. Xu and others have now returned to Guangzhou and have been warmly welcomed by Guangzhou seamen and people from all walks of life.

　　抗议英国追随美国侵略朝鲜
    供职英舰的中国海员许志洪等毅然返祖国
    【新华社广州十六日电】供职于英国航空母舰的中国海员许志洪等，因抗议英国追随美国发动侵略朝鲜战争，毅然脱离英舰返回祖国。许志洪原在英国航空母舰“独角兽”号上做酒吧工作。六月底美国侵略朝鲜的战事爆发后，该舰即装载炮弹、子弹和飞机离开新加坡驶往日本。当时舰上中国海员即表示反对。许志洪向大家说：这些炮弹、子弹是运去屠杀朝鲜人民的，美帝国主义侵略朝鲜是破坏世界和平的罪恶行为，中国工人必须坚决反对。当该舰到达日本佐世保军港时，许志洪更发动另一英舰“凯旋”号上的中国员工联合签名抗议。他们在抗议书上写着：“我们是来做工的，不是来抬子弹的，也不是参加战争的。”同时派出代表和该两舰的英国军官谈判。但他们的正义要求遭到该两舰的英国海军军官无理拒绝，他们并被降职和禁止上岸。许志洪和另外五十七个中国员工坚持反侵略的主张，辞职回到香港。到香港后，许志洪即和其他三位海员毅然返回祖国。现许等已返抵广州，受到广州海员和各界人民的热烈欢迎。
