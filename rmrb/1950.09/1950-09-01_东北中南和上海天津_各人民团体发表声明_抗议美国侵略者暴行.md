Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th. The aggressive and provocative acts of American aircraft intruding into the airspace of Northeast China, strafing our buildings, stations, vehicles, and Chinese people, causing casualties, have aroused immense anger among the people of all circles in Northeast China. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, the Northeast Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Northeast Student Federation, the Northeast Association of Health Workers, the Northeast Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Northeast Democratic Women's Federation, among other major people's organizations, have all issued written statements, unanimously expressing their support for Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and lodging a serious protest with the American government.
    The protest letter from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions stated: The people and working class of Northeast China should rise up in unison, increase vigilance a hundredfold, and make full preparations to resist the American army's acts of aggression against Northeast China and Taiwan! Defend the motherland, defend the frontier, and defend our economic construction.
    The Northeast Working Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Northeast Student Federation issued a written statement stating: All youth and students in Northeast China, in addition to publicizing and exposing such aggressive crimes of American imperialism among the broad masses of people, and becoming more vigilant, will support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions of intensifying production, diligent work, and study. We vow to fight for the early liberation of Taiwan and Tibet, for the defense of the motherland's borders, and for the smashing of any aggressive attempts by American imperialism.
    The Northeast Democratic Women's Federation issued a written statement stating: We women of Northeast China have the experience of fourteen years of anti-Japanese struggle, several years of self-defense war experience, and more than a year of economic construction experience. We are determined to support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions of participating in various industrial and agricultural production and construction, and actively prepare to liberate Taiwan and Tibet and defend the motherland's borders!
    The Northeast Federation of Literary and Art Circles issued a written statement stating: We believe that this shameless provocation by the United States is another open act of aggression following its aggression against Korea and our territory of Taiwan, and it also exposes once again the aggressive ambition of American imperialism to instigate war and undermine world peace. We will increase our vigilance against war instigators a hundredfold, dedicate all our strength, support the People's Liberation Army, liberate Taiwan and Tibet, defend the motherland's borders, and let the aggressors find their own graves there.
    The Northeast Association of Health Workers issued a written statement stating: We unanimously call on the Security Council to sanction this provocative act by the American army invading Korea, and to take immediate measures to withdraw it from Korea. Since American imperialism's aggression against China has new facts, every peace-loving person should unite more closely after signing the declaration in support of peace, rise up in unison, increase vigilance, and never allow the sovereignty of our territory and airspace to be invaded by imperialism again. All health workers in Northeast China will join the people from all walks of life across the country, concentrate our efforts, work harder for the construction cause, and fight for the defense of the frontier and for a peaceful and happy life.
    The Northeast Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association issued a written statement stating: We, representing 1.2 million members of the Northeast Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, demand that the Security Council stop the illegal act of the US imperialism of openly violating our country's airspace, demand that the US imperialism compensate for all losses, and we also call on members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in all parts of Northeast China to take active action, vigorously launch a signature campaign to defend world peace, and safeguard world and Far East peace with practical work.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 31st. People's organizations in the Central South Administrative Region and Wuhan expressed great anger at the unreasonable intrusion of American imperialist aircraft into our country's airspace, strafing our buildings in the Northeast, and injuring our compatriots, unanimously supported Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest to the American government, and condemned the crime of the American imperialists. The Preparatory Committee of the Central South Federation of Trade Unions, representing three million workers in the entire Central South Region, said in a telegram to the Security Council: "For the sake of peace in Asia and the world, the United Nations should immediately stop this act of aggression by the American imperialists." The Central South Branch of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Democratic Women's Federation, the Central South Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Preparatory Committee of the Central Plains Democratic Youth Federation, the Central Plains Student Federation, and the Preparatory Committee of the Central South Branch of the All-China Sports Federation, and other organizations all issued protest letters, vowing to oppose the American imperialists' aggressive acts against Northeast China and Taiwan with all their might.
    The Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, in addition to sending telegrams to Malik, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Lie, protesting the American imperialist acts of aggression, also issued a protest letter, expressing its willingness to be the government's backing with all the strength of the industrial and commercial circles. All the representatives of the city's Second Labor Model Symposium stated in a telegram protesting the American planes' invasion of our country's airspace: We are willing to work with all the workers to continuously improve our technology, build our motherland into a strong peace fortress, and support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement with our practical actions, so that the imperialists' conspiracy will never be realized. The Wuhan branch of the China Democratic League and the Preparatory Committee of the Wuhan branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association both expressed their determination to fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the American government in telegrams protesting the American planes' invasion of our airspace. The statement of the Wuhan branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association stated: "This incident not only shows that the American imperialists are expanding their armed aggression in Korea and our territory of Taiwan, but also 100% confirms that all the statements of the American imperialists and their representatives regarding 'not carrying out aggression' are completely lies."
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 30th. The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, the Shanghai Suburban Farmers Association, the Shanghai Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation, the Shanghai Student Federation, the Shanghai Consultative Committee, the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Shanghai Educational Trade Union, and other people's organizations, all issued written statements on the 29th, protesting the atrocities of American aircraft invading our country's airspace and shooting our people, and unanimously expressed their support for the protest lodged by our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the American government on August 27 and the just demands made to the Security Council.
    The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions stated: Under the leadership of our own People's Government, we workers of Shanghai are fully confident in liberating Taiwan and safeguarding lasting world peace. The imperialist aggressors who dare to provoke will surely eat their own bitter fruit!
    The Shanghai Suburban Farmers Association stated: We will never allow the United States to invade our country's airspace, territorial waters, and territory. We will work hard to produce and support the People's Liberation Army, and liberate Taiwan and the entire China as soon as possible.
    The Shanghai Working Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League stated: Shanghai youth express unparalleled anger at the provocative and aggressive actions of American aircraft. We will never allow any imperialists to invade our airspace, territorial waters, and territory again.
    The Shanghai Democratic Women's Federation said: The serious crimes of the United States attempting to expand the war and undermine peace are intolerable to the Chinese people. Shanghai women are determined to fight to the end to defend world peace in order to strive for the happiness and safety of themselves and their children.
    The Shanghai Student Federation pointed out in its statement: The provocation of American aircraft completely exposed the ugly faces of American aggressor war-mongers and exposed the shameless sophistry of the American government and its representatives in the Security Council.
    The Shanghai People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee stated: Foreign Minister Zhou's protest represents the just will of nearly 500 million Chinese people. In particular, the people of Shanghai, who have personally suffered from the continuous bombing of American-made bandit planes, cannot tolerate the United States wreaking havoc on our compatriots again! We, representing the five million people of Shanghai, solemnly warn American imperialism: We are absolutely not afraid of the threats of American aggressors, and we are determined to strengthen unity, make full preparations to realize Chairman Mao's call to "defeat any provocation by American imperialism." The American aggressors who dare to provoke will inevitably suffer a more disastrous defeat than in Korea.
    The Shanghai Federation of Literary and Art Circles stated: The United States should bear all responsibility and consequences for its crimes of invading our country's airspace and massacring our people.

We, representing the people of the entire city of Tianjin, resolutely support the demands made in Foreign Minister Zhou's telegram to the United Nations and the protest lodged with the American government. We demand that the United Nations Security Council sanction this provocative and brutal act by the American army invading Korea, and quickly take measures to stop American aircraft wantonly bombing the Korean people and invading our airspace and strafing our people, so that the American government completely withdraws its invading army in Korea and maintains peace and security in Asia and the world.
