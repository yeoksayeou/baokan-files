An Excellent Young Commander – Zhang Ming

In the great revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, has trained countless excellent commanders with high political consciousness, resourcefulness, courage, and both literary and military capabilities. Zhang Ming, the regimental commander and combat hero of the Third Field Army, is one such young commander.

Like the vast majority of commanders and soldiers in the People's Liberation Army, he comes from a poor family. He is twenty-six years old this year. In 1938, at the age of fourteen, he joined the Eighth Route Army, fighting the arduous anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines in Shandong. Over the past twelve years, under the education and cultivation of the Communist Party and the people, he rose from being a service member to deputy regimental commander. He has participated in more than forty battles. He is not only a famous combat hero but also a model worker and a model Party newspaper correspondent.

During the War of Liberation, Zhang Ming was wounded seven times, six of which he continued fighting without leaving the front line. However, this bravery and tenacity do not fully explain his combat style. His greatest characteristic is his composure and calmness. He can step forward during the most brutal and critical moments of battle, inspiring his comrades, turning the situation around, and seizing the final victory. In the winter of 1946, during the famous Su(qian)bei Campaign, Zhang Ming captured an important commanding height – Fengshan Peak – which played a significant role in the overall battle. At that time, Zhang Ming was the deputy political instructor of the battalion. The battalion launched three attacks on Fengshan Peak at night, all of which failed, resulting in heavy casualties, and the battalion commander was also wounded. Dawn was approaching, and time was of the essence. Zhang Ming gathered more than thirty soldiers, gave a short but impassioned political mobilization, and personally led these soldiers to launch an assault on the enemy at the peak. Just as he jumped into the enemy's outer trench, a piece of shrapnel hit his head. The intense pain almost made him fall, but realizing the impact a commander's injury or death would have at this critical moment, he steadied himself and climbed onto the enemy's wall. By this time, the soldiers had thrown explosives at the routed enemy, and the battle was won. In the battle to liberate Kaifeng for the first time in 1948, during the final annihilation of the enemy compressed in the "Longting" core stronghold in the northwest corner of the city, Zhang Ming led his battalion and stubbornly held the Jiaoyangyuan position near Longting under intense artillery and aircraft fire, creating favorable conditions for the final resolution of the Longting defenders.

A high sensitivity to new things, diligent study, and a serious and responsible attitude towards war have enabled Zhang Ming to enrich his war knowledge and command skills in increasingly large-scale wars, and solve many difficult combat missions. In the battles of Luoyang, Jinan, and Huaihai, Zhang Ming demonstrated outstanding talent in organizing combat.

During the Luoyang Campaign in the spring of 1948, the battalion commanded by Zhang Ming was responsible for breaking through the east gate of Luoyang. While the troops were marching towards Luoyang, Zhang Ming mobilized his subordinates to investigate the enemy's fortifications along the way by inquiring with residents. After entering the position, Zhang Ming went to the front line several times to observe the terrain, discuss with the cadres, and carefully arrange the battle. Each company, platoon, squad, blasting team, and assault team in the battalion also studied their respective tasks, carefully examined the terrain, asked questions, and came up with solutions. After the blasting squad of the third company accepted the arduous task of clearing multiple layers of obstacles outside the city, they spent a full day and a half investigating the terrain with residents and conducting exercises. After the second company accepted the task of breaking through the first line of fortifications, the second platoon leader, Second-Class Combat Hero Song Cangfu, and all the soldiers in the platoon carefully studied how to break through, the direction of the breakthrough, and even how many grenades should be thrown in advance. After such a mass military democracy movement, everything was ready, and the heroic soldiers, under the command of their heroic battalion commander Zhang Ming, launched an attack on the east gate according to the pre-determined plan. After fierce fighting, the east gate was broken through, and the flag of victory flew over the ancient capital of Luoyang. Zhang Ming was wounded on the front line, but he continued to command the battle without batting an eye. After the battle, this battalion was awarded the glorious title of "Luoyang Battalion."

Zhang Ming is not only an excellent military commander but also an excellent political worker and cultural worker. He is good at using patient persuasion and education to correct the mistakes made by soldiers. When he was the political instructor of the company, once, medical orderly Xia Yuzeng and Li Liangcai did not observe order in class. After class, Zhang Ming went to talk to them and saw that they were washing their scabies. Zhang Ming automatically lit a fire for them to make them comfortable. After they finished, Zhang Ming called them to the company headquarters and pointed out their mistake of not observing order in class in a kind manner. Both of them accepted it wholeheartedly. Zhang Ming remembers the naming day of every heroic and model squad and platoon in his battalion and the day of martyrdom of heroic figures. When the time comes, others often forget, but he personally presides over the memorial meeting to educate the troops in revolutionary heroism. He is also a powerful agitator, and his fiery words add infinite courage to the soldiers on the battlefield.

Zhang Ming loves literary books very much. He has read Soviet masterpieces such as "How Steel Was Tempered," "Fear and Fearlessness," and "Days and Nights" several times. He often writes for Party newspapers. During the War of Liberation, he wrote more than thirty literary works and news reports. His report on the People's Liberation Army soldiers implementing policies and discipline in the Luoyang Campaign, "The Clock on the Table," was praised by the Xinhua News Agency.

The reason why Zhang Ming has been able to achieve such achievements is because he is a Communist Party member. He is willing to accept the education of the Party and the criticism of the masses, and he is good at humbly examining and correcting his shortcomings. He has also had unsuccessful battles, and he has also had ideological errors and shortcomings, but he never hides his mistakes and shortcomings, but correctly uses the weapons of criticism and self-criticism to correct them, so that he always maintains a youthful spirit of continuous progress and a vast and far-reaching future in the revolutionary cause. He is not proud and complacent because of his achievements. He once said: "The revolutionary army is a big family and a big school. The Party has given glory to each of us and made us strong and useful... I keep firmly in my mind: without the Party, there would be no honor, and all honor should belong to the Party and the people!"

　　优秀的年青指挥员——张明
    在中国人民的伟大革命斗争中，中国人民解放军在中国共产党领导之下，锻炼出了无数具有高度政治觉悟和智勇双全、文武兼备的优秀指挥员。第三野战军的团长、战斗英雄张明，就是这样的一个年轻的指挥员。
    像人民解放军中绝大多数指战员一样，他出身于一个贫苦的家庭。今年二十六岁。一九三八年，在他十四岁的时候，就参加了在山东敌后艰苦抗日的八路军。十二年中，他在共产党和人民的教育培养之下，由一个勤务员而擢升为副团长。他参加过四十多次战斗。他不但是著名的战斗英雄，而且是工作模范和模范的党报通讯员。
    在解放战争中，张明负过七次伤，其中有六次是带伤作战不下火线的。但是这种英勇顽强还不能说明他的全部战斗作风，他的最大特色是沉着镇静，能够在战斗最残酷、情况最危急的时候挺身而出，鼓舞自己的战友们，把局势转变过来，夺取最后的胜利。一九四六年冬，著名的宿（迁）北战役中，张明就曾经这样夺下一个重要的制高点——烽山顶，对战役全局起了重大作用。当时张明任营的副教导员。该营夜里对烽山顶作了三次攻击都没有奏效，伤亡很大，营指挥员也负了伤。天色将明，时机紧迫。张明集合了三十多名战士，作了简短的激昂的政治鼓动后，就亲自带着这些战士向山顶敌人发起冲锋。正当他奋身跳进敌人工事外壕时，一块弹片打进了他的头部，剧痛使他几乎倒下去，可是他想到在这生死成败的关头，指挥员的伤亡会有多么大的影响，他就站稳了欲倒的身体，向前爬上敌人的圩墙。这时战士们已经把炸药投向溃乱的敌人，战斗取得了胜利。一九四八年首次解放开封的战斗中，在最后歼灭被压缩在城西北角“龙亭”核心据点里敌人的时候，张明带着他的一个营，曾经在敌炮飞机的猛烈轰击之下顽强坚持了龙亭附近的教养院阵地，为最后解决龙亭守敌造成了有利条件。
    对新事物的高度敏感和努力学习，对战争的严肃负责精神，使张明在规模日益巨大的战争里，丰富了自己的战争知识和指挥艺术，解决了多次艰巨的作战任务。在洛阳、济南、淮海等历次战役中，张明都表现了出色的组织战斗的天才。
    一九四八年春解放洛阳战役中，张明所指挥的营担负突破洛阳东门的任务。还在部队向洛阳开进时，张明就动员部下一路向居民调查洛阳敌人的工事情形。进入阵地以后，张明又好几次到前沿去观察地形，和干部研究商量，细致的布置了战斗。全营各连、排、班和爆破组、突击队也都研究各自所担负的任务，认真地看了地形，提问题、想办法。该营三连的爆破班接受了扫除城外多层障碍的艰巨任务以后，就整整花了一天半时间向居民进行调查，观察地形，并且作了演习。二连接受突破第一道工事的任务以后，二排长乙等战斗英雄宋苍富和全排战士细心研究了如何突破，突破口朝什么方向，甚至该打几个手榴弹都事先研究好了。经过这样群众性的军事民主运动，一切准备就绪，英雄的战士们就在他们的英雄营长张明指挥之下，按预定计划对东门发起攻击。经过激烈战斗以后，东门被突破了，胜利的旗帜飞上了洛阳古都的城头。张明在前沿阵地上负了伤，但他仍然不动声色地继续指挥作战。战后，这一个营获得了“洛阳营”的光荣称号。
    张明不但是一位优秀的军事指挥员，而且是一位优秀的政治工作者和文化工作者。他善于以耐性的说服教育来纠正战士们所犯的错误。当他还是连的政治指导员时，有一次，卫生员夏雨增和李良才上课不守秩序。下课以后，张明去找他们谈话，见他们两人正在洗疥疮，张明就自动给他们烧起火来，让他们舒舒服服的烤了一下。烤完以后，张明把他们叫到连部，和蔼地指出他们上课不守秩序的错误，两人都心悦诚服地接受了。张明记得自己营里每一个英雄模范班、排的命名日，和英雄人物的殉难日，到时候往往别人忘了，他却亲自去主持召开纪念会，对部队进行革命英雄主义的教育。他也是一个有力的鼓动家，他的火一样的话语，在战场上给战士们增添了无限的勇气。
    张明酷爱文艺书籍。《钢铁是怎样炼成的》、《恐惧与无畏》、《日日夜夜》等苏联名著他都读过几遍。他经常给党报写稿，在解放战争中他写过三十多篇文艺性作品和新闻通讯。他在洛阳战役中报道解放军战士执行政策纪律的通讯“桌上的表”，曾经得到过新华总社的表扬。
    张明之所以能够有这样的成就，是因为他是一个共产党员。他能勇于接受党的教育和群众的批评，善于虚心的检讨与纠正自己的缺点。他也曾有过失利的战斗，也曾有过思想上的错误和缺点，但他从不掩饰自己的错误和缺点，而是正确地运用了批评和自我批评的武器加以纠正，因此使自己永远保持了前进不息的青年气概和在革命事业中的辽阔远大的前程，他并没有因为自己的成就而骄傲自满，他曾经说过：“革命部队是个大家庭，大学校。党使得我们每一个人都有了光荣，都强健有用起来……我心里牢牢记着：没有党就没有荣誉，一切荣誉应该归于党，归于人民！”
