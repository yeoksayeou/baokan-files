　　Preventing Infectious Diseases from "Traveling"!
　　Introduction to the Northeast Railway Hygiene Experimental Line
　　By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

　　This is a painful historical lesson:
　　Two careless travelers once caused the largest infectious disease outbreak of the 20th century worldwide.
　　In 1910, plague broke out in Dauria, near Lake Baikal in Russia. On October 12th, two Chinese carpenters working there took the Siberian Railway train to Manchuria. Soon after, they coughed up blood and died, and the plague began to spread in the Northeast. By the end of the year, Shandong workers who were working in the Northeast returned home for the Chinese New Year, and the plague followed this group of returning travelers along the Beijing-Fengtian Railway (now the Beijing-Shenyang Railway) from the Northeast to Hebei. Thus, from November 1910 to March 1911, more than 60,000 people died of plague in Northeast China, Hebei, and other places, becoming the largest epidemic of the 20th century.
　　China's more than 20,000 kilometers of railways transport approximately 100 million passengers annually. In the past, under the reactionary rule that murdered people like flies, no one cared or could care about how many diseases and seeds of death were spread along these more than 20,000 kilometers of railways, directly or indirectly causing how many epidemics and harming how many lives.
　　Only when the people themselves have seized power is it possible to guarantee the people's lives and health in all aspects. Starting this year, the first railway hygiene experimental line in China has appeared – from Manchuria to Shanhaiguan. On this thousand-kilometer railway line, the twenty-seven passenger trains running daily must strictly prevent passengers with infectious diseases from boarding.
　　This is the concrete implementation of the "prevention first" policy in transportation hygiene.
　　At the main stations on this hygiene experimental line, epidemic prevention agencies have been established—epidemic prevention stations, quarantine stations, and temporary isolation rooms. The epidemic prevention stations of the Harbin, Shenyang, Jinzhou, and other railway administrations have also set up laboratories. The entrances and exits of major stations and long-distance trains running more than 400 kilometers are equipped with epidemic prevention workers. If they find passengers with major infectious diseases, they will prevent them from boarding or advise them to get off the train and send them to the quarantine station for examination, and if necessary, transfer them to the hospital. From January to April this year, fourteen quarantine stations in Harbin and other places inspected 15,482 trains, found 1,105 patients, and advised or prevented 146 seriously ill patients from boarding, and sent 142 people to the hospital. The result of doing so not only directly protects the lives of these passengers, but also prevents the spread of major infectious diseases.
　　Stations that were extremely old and dilapidated due to the destruction by enemy puppets and the Kuomintang have begun to be repaired and renovated; resting benches, canteens, hot water equipment, etc. have also been gradually replenished or added in various stations, and a hygiene responsibility system has been established in waiting rooms and platforms. These facilities and measures have initially improved the environmental hygiene of the stations.
　　In order to protect the safety and health of mothers and infants, mother-and-child waiting rooms and mother-and-child ticket gates have been set up at stations with a large number of passengers in Shenyang, Changchun, Jinzhou, Siping, and other places, and all passenger cars running on the line have special mother-and-child cars.
　　A hygiene responsibility system has also been established in passenger cars—attendants share the hygiene responsibility for each car. Public security personnel are responsible for supervising passengers to keep clean. Epidemic prevention workers are responsible for epidemic prevention, hygiene guidance, inspection, and publicity and education work. When the passenger car returns to the depot after each run, it is cleaned and disinfected to eliminate carbon dioxide, bedbugs, and fleas. When leaving the depot, the train captain, epidemic prevention worker, attendant, and public security personnel jointly inspect it. This greatly improves the hygiene of the train. Clean carriages bring passengers a pleasant journey.

### 不让传染病“旅行”！  东北铁道卫生实验线介绍

　　不让传染病“旅行”！
    东北铁道卫生实验线介绍
    本报记者  金凤
    这是一个惨痛的历史教训：
    两个不谨慎的旅客，曾经造成二十世纪全世界最大的一次传染病。
    一九一○年俄国贝加尔湖达乌里乌地方发生了鼠疫。十月十二日，在那里做工的两名中国木工乘着西伯利亚铁道火车到达满洲里，不久他们吐血身亡，鼠疫即开始在东北蔓延。到了年底，在东北做工的山东工人回家过年，鼠疫又随着这一批归家的旅客沿着京奉铁道（即现在的京沈路）从东北到了河北。这样，从一九一○年十一月到一九一一年三月，中国东北、河北等地因鼠疫死亡的共有六万多人，成为二十世纪世界上曾经发生过的最大一次流行病。
    中国全境两万多公里的铁道，每年乘降旅客在一亿左右。在过去反动统治杀人如麻的时代，究竟有多少疾病、死亡的种子沿着这两万多公里的铁道散布开去，直接、间接酿成了多少次流行病，伤害了多少人的生命，这是没有人过问也过问不了的。
    只有人民自己掌握了政权，才可能从各方面来保障人民的生命和健康。从今年起，在中国出现了第一条铁道卫生实验线——从满洲里到山海关。在这一千公里的铁道上，每天奔驰着的二十七次客车，都要严格防止有传染病的旅客上车。
    这是“预防为主”的方针在交通卫生方面的具体贯彻。
    在这卫生实验线上的主要车站，都设立了防疫机关——防疫站、检疫所和临时隔离室。哈尔滨、沈阳、锦州等管理局防疫站内还设立化验所。主要车站的出入口和运行四百公里以上的长途列车都配备了防疫员。他们发现有重要传染病的旅客，就阻止他上车或劝告他下车，送检疫所检查，必要时转送医院。从今年一月到四月，哈尔滨等十四个检疫所检查了一万五千四百八十二次列车，发现了一千一百○五名病人，被劝告下车或被阻止上车的严重病人有一百四十六人，送进医院的有一百四十二人。这样做的结果，不仅直接保障了这些旅客的生命安全，同时阻止了主要传染病的蔓延。
    由于敌伪、国民党的破坏而致十分陈旧、破败的车站开始得到修整和刷新；休息长椅、食堂、开水设备等也都陆续在各车站充实或添设起来，候车室和站台建立了卫生负责制。这些设备和措施初步改善了车站的环境卫生。
    为保护母亲、婴孩的安全和健康，沈阳、长春、锦州、四平等处乘客较多的车站都设立了妇婴候车室和妇婴剪票口，所有该线运行的客车都有妇婴专用车。
    客车内也建立了卫生负责制——乘务员分担各节车的卫生责任。公安人员负责督促旅客保持清洁。防疫员负责防疫、卫生的指导以及检查和宣传教育的工作。当客车运转一次入库时，都进行清洁消毒，消灭炭酸气、臭虫和跳蚤。出库时由当次车车长、防疫员、乘务员及公安人员联合检查。这就大大改进了列车的卫生情况。清洁的车厢带给旅客们一个愉快的旅行。
