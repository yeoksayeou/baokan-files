Xinhua News Agency, 26th: At the second morning of the National Conference of Combat Heroes Representatives, combat heroes Liu Sihu, Zhang Yingcai, Zhang Ming, and female combat hero Guo Junqing successively gave model speeches at the meeting. This is the beginning of the hero model representatives reporting their glorious deeds and exchanging combat and work experience. When the four heroes spoke, they all warmly paid tribute to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. They all pointed out that victory and honor belong to the people and the people's leader. The hero models also congratulated each other on their gathering and paid tribute to all the commanders and fighters of the brother units. A warm and united atmosphere filled the venue.

　　Steel Battalion Commander Zhang Yingcai
　　Among the four heroes who spoke this morning, two were young commanders who grew up during the more than ten years of the People's Liberation War. Combat hero Zhang Yingcai, who has twice won the honorary title of "Steel Battalion Commander," has participated in sixteen campaigns and more than sixty major battles since joining the army in 1939. He has been wounded six times in battle. Due to his outstanding combat achievements, he has now been transferred and promoted to acting deputy regimental commander of a certain unit of the Second Field Army. This steel-like combat hero demonstrated outstanding command ability in the Yu-Dong Sui-Qi campaign in July 1949 and the Huaihai Campaign in 1948. In the three battles of the above two major campaigns, Zhang Yingcai's battalion fought bravely against Chiang Kai-shek's bandit troops, which were dozens of times larger in number and supported by air force and tanks, and finally successfully completed the combat tasks. In the above three battles, Zhang Yingcai used the tactical principle of combining the use of mobile reserve troops with precise organization of firepower to defeat the powerful enemy. In the battle of Xiaozhangzhuang to annihilate the Huang Wei Corps, all commanders and fighters of Zhang Yingcai's battalion were gloriously rewarded with a major merit each.

　　Luoyang Battalion Commander Zhang Ming
　　The Yichuan Campaign in Shaanxi and the campaign to liberate the ancient city of Luoyang in the spring of 1948 were two great victories that complemented each other at the time. Combat hero Zhang Ming, now deputy regimental commander of a certain unit of the Third Field Army, was the battalion commander of a certain battalion that cooperated with brother units to capture the city of Luoyang. The battalion he led successfully entered the city of Luoyang after clearing fifteen modern and strongly fortified defense works of the Chiang bandit army. After the war, they were gloriously named the Luoyang Battalion. This twenty-six-year-old young commander reported the process of this siege battle at the meeting, thereby vividly illustrating the process of the commanders of the People's Liberation Army mastering regular operations in the war. In the early days of the War of Liberation, he was a junior commander who won the love of soldiers for his brave fighting. However, modern warfare cannot be won by bravery alone. Before the Luoyang campaign, his comrades put forward new demands on him. He did not disappoint them. He learned the art of using wisdom and combining it with bravery in combat.

　　Combat Hero Liu Sihu
　　Combat hero Liu Sihu, who stabbed and wounded seven enemies in the Yichuan campaign, reported in detail on his deeds in this battle at the meeting. At the end of this battle, only he was left in the squad he led. He was not afraid and still moved forward bravely. The hero spoke of his steel-like determination to hate the enemy: "We must win. If one person is left, we must fight to the end, eliminate the enemy, and bite the enemy to death with our mouths!"

　　Female Combat Hero Guo Junqing
　　Female combat hero Guo Junqing, who fought side by side with male soldiers on the battlefield, reported her amazing and glorious struggle history. For more than five years, she had been concealing her true gender. When she joined the Communist Party of China, the Party required everyone to be loyal and frank. She said: "I concealed it from the Party in order to persist in carrying out combat missions." During the long march south last year, she fell ill due to gynecological problems caused by marching and fighting. In order to preserve her life and work for the revolution for a long time, she entered the hospital and reported that she was a woman. This nineteen-year-old female hero vowed to continue her combat life. She firmly said: "Yesterday I saw Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, they gave me greater strength. In order to defeat the aggression of American imperialism, I will continue to participate in the great battle to defend the motherland." The female hero's strong words aroused warm applause from the audience.

　　战斗英雄典型发言
    他们都指出：胜利和荣誉属于人民和人民的领袖
    【新华社二十六日讯】全国战斗英雄代表会议第二日上午，战斗英雄刘四虎、张英才、张明和女战斗英雄郭俊卿先后在会上作了典型发言。这是英雄模范代表们报告自己光辉事迹和交换战斗、工作经验的开始。四位英雄发言时，都热烈地向毛主席、朱总司令致敬。他们都指出：胜利和荣誉属于人民和人民的领袖。英雄模范们并为自己的聚会而互相祝贺，并向各兄弟部队全体指战员致敬意，会场上洋溢着亲密团结的气氛。
  钢铁营长张英才
    今天上午发言的四位英雄中，有两位是从十多年人民解放战争中成长起来的青年指挥员。两次荣膺“钢铁营长”光荣称号的战斗英雄张英才，从一九三九年参军到现在，已经参加过十六次战役，计六十多次主要战斗，并在战斗中负伤六次，由于他建立了卓著的战斗功勋，现已调升为第二野战军某部代理副团长。这位钢铁式的战斗英雄，在一九四九年七月的豫东睢杞战役和一九四八年淮海战役的作战中，表现了卓越的指挥才能。在上述两大战役的三次作战中，张英才营与数量上强大数十倍，并有空军、坦克掩护的蒋介石匪军奋战，最后出色地完成了战斗任务。在上述三次战斗中，张英才运用了使用机动后备部队与精密组织火力相结合的战术原则战胜了强大的敌人。在歼灭黄维兵团的小张庄战斗中，张英才营全体指战员获得了每人各记大功一次的光荣奖励。
  洛阳营指挥员张明
    一九四八年春天陕西宜川战役和解放洛阳古城的战役，是当时交相辉映的两个伟大胜利。现为第三野战军某部副团长的战斗英雄张明是当时配合兄弟部队夺取洛阳城某营的营长。他所率领的营在扫除了蒋匪军十五道现代化强固防御工事后胜利攻入了洛阳城，他们在战后荣膺了洛阳营的光荣命名。这位二十六岁的青年指挥员在会上报告这个攻坚战斗的经过，从而生动地说明了人民解放军指挥员在战争中掌握正规作战的过程。在解放战争初期，他是以勇敢作战获得战士们爱戴的初级指挥员。然而现代的战争不是光靠勇敢可以取得胜利的。在洛阳战役前，他的战友们向他提出了新的要求。他没有使他们失望。他在战斗中学会了使用智慧并结合勇敢的作战艺术。
  战斗英雄刘四虎
    在宜川战役中刺死刺伤敌人七名的战斗英雄刘四虎，在会上详细地报告了他这次作战的事迹。在这次作战的最后，他带领的一个班只留下了他自己一个人。他没有畏惧，仍勇往直前。英雄说出了憎恨敌人的钢铁般的决心：“我们一定要胜利，留下一个人，要战到最后，要消灭敌人，用嘴也要咬死敌人！”
  女战斗英雄郭俊卿
    在战场上曾和男战士并肩作战过的女战斗英雄郭俊卿报告了她令人讶异的光辉斗争史迹。五年多来，她一直隐瞒了自己的真正性别。在她参加中国共产党的时候，党要求每个人必须忠诚坦白。她说：“我为了要坚持执行战斗任务而隐瞒了党。”去年南下的长途进军中，因为在行军作战中所得下的妇女生理病，使她病倒下来。为了保留自己的生命为革命长期工作，她走进了医院，并报告了她自己是个女性。这位十九岁的女英雄誓言要继续她的战斗生活。她坚决地说：“昨天我看见了毛主席和朱总司令，他们给了我更大的力量。为了打垮美帝国主义的侵略，我要继续参加保卫祖国的伟大战斗。”女英雄的壮言激起了全场热烈的掌声。
