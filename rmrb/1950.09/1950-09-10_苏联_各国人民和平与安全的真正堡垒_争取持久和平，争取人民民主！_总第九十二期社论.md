All advocates of peace, all advanced and progressive people, unanimously express their great satisfaction and joy regarding the communiqué issued by the Soviet Peace Committee concerning the completion in the Soviet Union of the signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress.

From June 30th to August 1st, in just one month, one hundred fifteen million, two hundred seventy-five thousand, nine hundred and forty Soviet citizens – the entire adult population of the country – participated in the signing, unanimously expressing opposition to war, advocating the prohibition of atomic weapons, demanding the establishment of international control to supervise the implementation of this prohibition, and demanding that any government that first uses this weapon of mass extermination against other countries be declared a war criminal.

The great Soviet people, the victors and builders of communism, unanimously signed in support of the Stockholm Appeal for Peace. This action once again demonstrated to the world the Soviet people's deep love of peace, their unwavering will to uphold peace and cooperate with the people of other countries, and their vanguard role in the struggle for human happiness.

The peace signature campaign was conducted under the auspices of the Soviet Peace Committee. This movement truly had a nationwide character. It powerfully demonstrated the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society, showing the Soviet people's loyalty to their government, to the Bolshevik Communist Party, and to the great standard-bearer of peace, the teacher of people all over the world – Comrade Stalin.

The signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal for Peace within the Soviet Union proved the solidarity of the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Communist Party, and their determination to protect humanity from the new war and disasters being prepared by Anglo-American warmongers. This can be clearly seen in the resolute declaration against atomic weapons put forward by the highest organ of Soviet power, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in its endorsement of the Stockholm Appeal for Peace. Further proof is provided by the statements made by hundreds of thousands of Soviet people at various meetings and rallies. By signing the Stockholm Appeal for Peace, the Soviet people also demonstrated their enthusiastic support for the peaceful Stalinist foreign policy pursued by the Soviet government, a policy based on the recognition of the equality of all nations and respect for the sovereignty, freedom, and independence of all nations. The Soviet people unanimously declared that they are ready at any time, under the leadership of their government, to stand at the forefront of the opposition to war and, together with peace-loving countries, to safeguard peace. They fully believe that the imperialist warmongers will be curbed, and the just cause of defending peace will triumph.

The unanimous signing of the Stockholm Appeal by the Soviet people, their powerful demonstration of support for peace fighters worldwide, has made another contribution to the noble struggle of all progressive humanity against war, to consolidate peace, and to strive for the security of all nations. The active participation of the Soviet people in the movement to defend peace has inspired peace fighters, greatly increased their strength, and further expanded the scope and mass base of the peace movement. The people of all countries are gradually recognizing that the Soviet people are a loyal and reliable fortress in the organized international peace front; in the struggle for peace, the people of all countries can unhesitatingly believe that the Soviet Union is the most resolute opponent of a new war. It is no coincidence that, at the very time when the Soviet people were signing the Stockholm Appeal for Peace against war, and the U.S. imperialists were instigating war in Korea, a new wave of pro-peace activity surged up in all countries. Up to now, a total of 273,470,566 people from countries around the world have signed in support of the Stockholm Appeal for Peace. If we consider that only adults sign, it can be said that a total of 600 million people, or one-quarter of the world's population, have already endorsed the Peace Appeal. Therefore, the peace movement has achieved a truly magnificent scale, expressing the will of the people of all countries, regardless of their political or religious views, and regardless of their social status.

Millions more good people, determined to shatter the evil conspiracies of the enemies of mankind, are being drawn into the struggle for peace and against the warmongers.

The aggression of the U.S. troops in Korea has provoked fierce protests from hundreds of millions of people in all countries, and angry cries of "Hands off Korea!" are resounding throughout the world. Among the people of all countries, a fiery hatred has been ignited for the American interventionists and their accomplices such as Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, and Australia.

All the efforts of the U.S. ruling class to disguise the U.S. armed intervention in Korea in the name of the United Nations and to drag other capitalist countries into the bloody adventure in Korea are futile.

The people of all countries see clearly where peace is and where war is; what is a policy of peace and what is a policy of aggression; what is a policy of launching new military adventures, and what is a policy of deliberately planning the destruction of mankind for the profits of a handful of Anglo-American monopoly capitalists. The imperialists can never use the banner of the United Nations to conceal their vile deeds against humanity.

The whole world knows that from the day the United Nations was founded, the Soviet government has strived to transform the United Nations into an effective organ for international cooperation, an effective tool for maintaining peace and international security.

This effort of the Soviet government is specifically manifested in the Soviet proposal that the five major powers, Britain, the United States, France, China, and the Soviet Union, sign a peace treaty, unconditionally ban atomic weapons, and reduce the armed forces of these five major powers by one-third. This proposal is called the "peace plan" by the people of all countries. This effort of the Soviet government is in line with the interests of all peace-loving nations.

The Soviet government's efforts to strive for world peace were recently manifested in Stalin's reply to Nehru's proposal. Stalin stated that the Korean issue should be resolved peacefully by the Security Council, with the participation of representatives of the five major powers, including the Government of the People's Republic of China. He stated that the Security Council must listen to the opinions of the representatives of the Korean people.

Based on this statement by Stalin, the Soviet representative raised two very urgent issues to the Security Council: one was "to recognise the representative of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China as China's representative," and the other was "to peacefully resolve the Korean issue."

The U.S.-British bloc – the bloc of warmongers and their accomplices – refused to consider the Soviet proposals, openly and arrogantly exposing their extremely hostile attitude towards peace. The actions of the U.S. rulers, who ignorantly distort the basic principles and practices of international law and manipulate the Security Council, once again expose them as deliberate aggressors who will stop at nothing to achieve their predatory, blatant imperialist goals.

The U.S. rulers rejected the Soviet proposal, secured the support of an obedient "majority," and submitted a resolution to the Security Council – a resolution falsely entitled "Complaint Regarding the Aggression Against the Republic of Korea" – deliberately preventing a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. What they care about is not peace but war. The U.S. rulers have long embarked on the path of aggression, seeking to achieve world domination. They use slander and outright lies to try to conceal their true purpose. However, the lies fabricated by U.S.-British propaganda regarding the outbreak of the Korean War have been exposed to the world by the Soviet Union, which proved that the Korean War was a civil war, caused by the Syngman Rhee gang's attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; the U.S. armed intervention in this civil war is an act of direct armed aggression. This aggression by the United States is spreading to other countries in Asia. The U.S. imperialists are openly interfering in the internal affairs of China, Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries. The U.S. government is mobilizing more troops, rushing them to various war bases, and a frantic arms expansion movement is underway. The United States and its vassal states are taking broader military measures. All this further proves that the U.S. aggression in Korea is only part of the U.S. imperialist aggression plan, and humanity is facing the threat of the United States directly attempting to launch a new world war.

But what the people of all countries around the world want is peace, not war. They not only want peace, but are actively striving for peace. The unprecedented expansion of the peace movement is a serious warning to the imperialist camp. It is not the Soviet Union and the peace-democracy camp it leads that fear war, but the imperialists and aggressors.

The Soviet Union, China, and other people's democracies are advancing under the banner of lasting peace and world peace. In all countries, millions of people are united without exception under this banner, contributing all their energy to the great cause of striving for peace. More millions of people must be called upon in all countries to condemn war. The organized will of the people of all countries will surely thwart the evil, bloody plans of the instigators of a new war.

　　苏联——各国人民和平与安全的真正堡垒
    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”总第九十二期社论
    一切和平的拥护者，全体先进与进步的人们，对于苏联和平委员会关于苏联国内完成世界和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的征集签名运动所发表的公报，都一致表示极大的满意和欣慰。
    从六月三十到八月一日，仅仅在一个月之内，就有一亿一千五百二十七万五千九百四十个苏联公民——全国全部成年的人口——参加了签名，一致表示反对战争，主张禁止原子武器，要求建立国际管制，监督这种禁令的执行，并要求宣布首次使用这种大批消灭人类的侵略武器以对付其他国家的任何政府为战犯。
    伟大的苏联人民，共产主义的胜利者和建设者，一致签名拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言，这种行动又一再对全世界表明了苏联人民深爱和平，拥护和平并与其他国家的人民合作的不屈不挠的意志，这种行动也表明了苏联人民在争取人类幸福的斗争中的先锋作用。
    和平签名运动是在苏联和平委员会主持下进行的。这一运动真正具有全国范围的性质。它有力地显示了苏联社会在精神上与政治上的团结，显示了苏联人民对于他的政府，对于布尔什维克共产党，对于伟大的和平旗手，全世界人民的导师——斯大林同志——的忠诚。
    苏联国内为斯德哥尔摩和平宣言征集签名的运动证明了苏联人民、苏联政府和共产党团结一致，决心保护人类，反对英美战争贩子正在准备的新的战争和灾害的决心。这可以从苏联政权最高权力机关——苏联最高苏维埃——发表的拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言中所提出的禁止原子武器的坚决宣言中明显地看出来。其他的证明是成千成万的苏联人在各种会议和集会上所发表的言论。苏联人民在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签名，这也就表明他们热烈赞成苏联政府所执行的和平的斯大林外交政策，这种外交政策是以承认各民族平等，尊重各民族的主权、自由与独立为基础的。苏联人民一致声明他们随时准备在他们政府的领导下，站在反对战争的前线，并与爱好和平的国家一起，维护和平。他们充分相信帝国主义战争贩子将被遏止，保卫和平的正义事业将要取得胜利。
    苏联人民的一致在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，他们声援全世界和平斗士的强有力的示威，对于全体进步人类反对战争、巩固和平、争取各民族安全的崇高斗争又作了一种贡献。苏联人民积极参加保卫和平的运动，鼓舞了和平斗士，大大地增加了他们的力量，更加扩大了和平运动的范围和群众基础。各国的人民逐渐认识到苏联人民是有组织的国际和平阵线忠实可靠的堡垒；在争取和平的斗争中，各国人民可以毫不迟疑地相信苏联是新战争最坚决的反对者。正当苏联人民签名拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言反对战争，而美帝国主义者却在朝鲜挑动战争的时候，一切国家中拥护和平的活动又涌起了新的浪潮，并不是一件偶然的事。到现在为止，全世界各国签名拥护斯德哥尔摩和平宣言的人共有二亿七千三百四十七万五百六十六人之多。假使我们估计到只有成年的人才签名，可以说一共有六亿人，或者全世界人口的四分之一，已经拥护了和平宣言。因此和平运动取得了真正壮阔的规模，它表达各国人民的意志，不管他们的政治与宗教见解如何，他们的社会地位怎样。
    千百万更多的善良并决心粉碎人类敌人罪恶阴谋的人，正被卷入争取和平、反对战争贩子的斗争中。
    美国军队在朝鲜的侵略引起了一切国家中亿万人民猛烈的抗议，全世界各地响彻着“不许干涉朝鲜”的愤怒的呼声。在各国人民中间，对于美国干涉者及其英、加、荷、澳等帮凶们，燃起了火焰般的憎恨。
    美国统治阶级企图以联合国的名义去掩饰美国在朝鲜的武装干涉，并拖其他资本主义国家参加在朝鲜的血腥冒险，这一切的努力都是徒劳的。
    各国人民看清了那儿是和平，那儿是战争；什么是和平政策，什么是侵略政策；什么是发动新的军事冒险的政策；什么是为了一小撮英美垄断资本家的利润而蓄意计划毁灭人类的政策。帝国主义者绝不能够用联合国的旗帜遮掩他们反对人类的下流勾当。
    全世界都知道，从联合国成立的那天起，苏联政府就努力想把联合国变成一个有效的国际合作的机构，一个维持和平与国际安全的有效工具。
    苏联政府的这种努力，具体表现于苏联提议由英、美、法、中、苏五国签订一个和平条约，无条件禁止原子武器，裁减这五大国的军队三分之一，这种建议被各国人民称为“和平方案”。苏联政府的这种努力，是与爱好和平各民族的利益相符合的。
    苏联政府争取世界和平的这种努力最近表现于斯大林对于尼赫鲁建议的答复。斯大林声明应由包括中国人民政府在内的，五大国的代表必须参加的安全理事会来和平解决朝鲜问题。他声明安全理事会必须听取朝鲜人民代表的意见。
    根据斯大林这个声明，苏联代表向安全理事会提出两个非常迫切的问题：一个是“承认中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表为中国的代表”，另一个是“和平解决朝鲜问题”。
    美英集团——战争贩子与其同谋犯的集团——拒绝考虑苏联的建议，公开而傲慢地暴露他们极端敌视和平的态度。美国统治者无知地曲解国际法的基本原则与惯例，把持安全理事会，这种行动又一次地暴露他们是有计划的侵略者，不惜采用各种手段实现他们掠夺的，明目张胆的帝国主义的目标。
    美国统治者拒绝了苏联的建议，取得了唯命是听的“多数”的支持，向安全理事会提出决议案——这个决议案虚伪地名为“关于侵略朝鲜共和国的控诉”——有计划地阻止用和平方法解决朝鲜问题。他们所关心的不是和平而是战争。美国统治者早就走上了侵略的道路，以求达到独霸全世界的目的。他们利用污蔑和公开撒谎以图掩饰他们的真正目的。但是关于朝鲜战争爆发问题，美英宣传捏造的谎言，已被苏联向全世界揭穿，苏联证明了朝鲜战争是内战，是由李承晚匪帮向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进攻而引起的；美国武装干涉这次内战，是一种直接武装侵略的行为。美国的这种侵略正伸展到亚洲其他的国家。美国帝国主义者正在公开地干涉中国、越南、菲律宾等国的内政。美国政府正在动员更多的军队，赶派到各战争基地，疯狂的扩张军备运动正在进行中，美国及其附庸国家正在采取更广泛的军事措施。这一切更证明美国在朝鲜的侵略只是美帝国主义侵略计划的一部分，人类面临着美国直接企图发动新的世界战争的威胁。
    但是全世界各国人民所要求的是和平而不是战争，他们不仅要求和平，而且在积极争取和平。和平运动空前的扩大，对于帝国主义阵营是一种严重的警告。害怕战争的不是苏联和它所领导的和平民主阵营，而是帝国主义者和侵略者。
    苏联、中国和其他人民民主国家是在持久和平、全世界和平的旗帜下前进。在各国内，千百万的人民毫无例外地团结在这旗帜下，贡献他们全部的精力，为争取和平的伟大事业而奋斗。必须在各国内号召更多的千百万人民谴责战争。各国人民有组织的意志必能挫败新战争挑拨者罪恶的流血计划。
