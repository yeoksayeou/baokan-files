Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The representatives from the five provinces of North China attending the National Conference of Worker, Peasant, and Soldier Labor Model Representatives have all been selected by the beginning of September. A total of 28 industrial labor models, 44 agricultural labor models, and 6 military labor models were selected from the entire region. The selected representatives include advanced heroic and model figures from various industrial and agricultural production fronts. Among them are Lian Wanlu and Ma Liu Hai, the top-notch models from the Datong Coal Mine in Chahar, who led the entire mine in continuously setting new records; Li Xiujun, the special-grade production advanced worker from the Tangshan Power Plant in Hebei, who set a new national coal consumption record; Liu Jiuxue, the safety model from the Jiaozuo Coal Mine in Pingyuan Province, who created an unprecedented record of no casualties in nineteen months; Wang Guiying, the steelmaking model from the Taiyuan Steel Plant in Shanxi; Liu Jubao, the agricultural production technology improvement expert from Lucheng County in Shanxi Province; and Liu Suochan, the labor model from Suiyuan Province who selflessly blocked the breach in the dike during flood control and rescue efforts.
　　The model selection meetings in various locations introduced the deeds of heroes and models and exchanged production experiences through typical reports, photo exhibitions, and other methods, making the selection of labor models a broad mass movement to promote new heroism.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 13th. The 50 industrial representatives and 40 agricultural representatives from the Northeast region attending the National Conference of Worker, Peasant, and Soldier Labor Model Representatives have all been selected. The elected worker and peasant labor model representatives are all outstanding individuals with meritorious service in production, prestige among the masses, and have repeatedly won the titles of labor heroes or labor models in various provinces, cities, and enterprises. Among the industrial representatives are 38 model workers in improving product quality, ensuring safe power supply, improving technology, making rationalization proposals, and protecting factories, one model engineer and one technician, three model factory directors, three model staff members, two model medical workers, and two model trade union cadres. Among them are three women and two workers from private enterprises. Among the agricultural representatives are 12 model farmers in labor mutual aid, intensive farming, and production for disaster relief, three model rural cadres, three model tractor drivers from state-owned farms, seven models in special products such as cotton planting, tussah silkworm raising, fruit trees, flax, and fishing, three animal husbandry models, three models in forest protection and afforestation, two water conservancy models, one production model for honorary soldiers, and six model cooperative workers. Among them are three women and two ethnic minorities.
　　Various localities have fully promoted the spirit of democracy in the elections and have universally carried out production competitions in conjunction with current practical work, inspiring everyone's production enthusiasm. For example, after the Benxi Coal and Iron Company put forward the slogan "Improve quality, reduce costs, and do a good job in business management," the employees immediately took action. The workers of the Jilin Fanjiatun Sugar Factory automatically paid attention to saving materials during the construction work, and have already saved raw materials worth more than 300 million yuan (Northeast currency).
