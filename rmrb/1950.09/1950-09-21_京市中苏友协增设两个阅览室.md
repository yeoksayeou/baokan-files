　　Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Adds Two Reading Rooms

    In order to make it convenient for its members to read various books and periodicals about the Soviet Union at any time, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, in addition to jointly establishing a reading room with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education in the Second District (No. 5, West Xiejie, Xidan) in early July, successively established two reading rooms with the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education in the Eleventh District (No. 3, West Erdao Street, Nanyuan) and the Fifth District (No. 31, Shatan) in August and September. It is now actively preparing reading rooms in the other thirteen districts inside and outside the city, striving to establish them all in October, so as to provide members with a wider range of reading materials.

　　京市中苏友协增设两个阅览室
    北京市中苏友好协会为便于广大会员能够随时阅读到有关苏联的各种书刊，除于七月初与京市文教局在第二区（西单西斜街五号）联合成立了一个阅览室外，在八、九月内与京市文教局联合先后成立了第十一区（南苑西二道街三号）与第五区（沙滩三十一号）两个阅览室。现在正积极筹备市内外其他十三个区阅览室，争取十月份里全部成立。以便更广泛地供会员阅览。
