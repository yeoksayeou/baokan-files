The Lüda Grain Company established a system for storing grain in the first half of this year and created some methods, thereby ensuring that state property was not lost.

(I) The Key to Success
None of the company's six warehouses are modern granaries. The best are brick walls, iron frames, and cement floors. In the first half of this year, they stored 89,250 tons of various grains, including corn with a moisture content of around 20% and sorghum, millet, and soybeans with a moisture content of around 17%. However, thanks to the active efforts of all storage personnel, by the end of July, they had not only completed the task of drying more than 50,000 tons of wet grain, but the total losses, including the residual grain dug up from the warehouse floor from last year, were only a little over two tons, a loss rate of one in 44,000.

The key to achieving this success, in addition to the work system and methods, was primarily solving the empiricist and conservative thinking that existed from top to bottom within the company. First, they broke the conservative idea that “grain can only be dried in April and May.” In early February, they convened a grain drying meeting for the directors, inspectors, and workers of all affiliated grain depots. It was pointed out that although drying grain in February is not as effective as in May, drying it for two extra days can be equivalent to one day in May. Leading comrades personally inspected and tested the effect of grain drying, using practical examples to educate cadres and workers. As a result, 50,000 tons of wet grain were dried in advance, laying the foundation for safe storage through the summer.

Secondly, they broke the idea that “insect infestations are inevitable every year and there is no way to control them.” After discovering insects in April and May, the leadership paid attention to last year’s insect prevention experience and convened a joint meeting of warehouse directors to study insect control methods. In addition to applying last year’s methods of wind screening and drying, they also organized manpower to catch insects and implemented a dedicated responsibility system, launching an insect control campaign. This fundamentally eliminated insect infestations in the grain depots this year.

The elimination of conservative thinking increased the confidence of the staff, coupled with the coordinated actions of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, with Party and Youth League members taking the lead in promoting the work. Combined with the merit campaign, the creativity and enthusiasm of the staff were brought into play, and manpower was organized to think of more ways, create tools, establish systems, and implement a dedicated responsibility system. Therefore, in very poor warehouse conditions, they overcame mold and insects, the two enemies in grain storage, in the first half of the year.

(II) Three Methods
1.  Testing: Testing is a prerequisite for understanding the specific conditions of grain. All grain must be sampled and tested upon entry into the warehouse to determine the composition of the grain – the percentage of moisture and impurities it contains. Based on the composition of the grain, the number of temperature checks, turning, tamping, ventilation, sifting, drying, and other work is determined to maintain the good quality of the grain. The method is as follows:

    Sampling – Taking a small portion of a certain amount of grain to represent the whole, so sampling must be as accurate as possible. The company’s sampling method (grain carried in cars or trains is sampled before entering the warehouse) is as follows: For loose grain in cars, samples are taken from the four corners, the center point, and the upper and lower layers. For packaged grain in cars, one sample is taken for every ten bags if there are more than one hundred bags. For loose grain in trains, the sampling should be determined based on the size of the car. For loose grain in the warehouse, samples are taken from the middle and four corners of every 100 cubic meters. For bagged grain stacked in the warehouse, one sample is taken for every ten bags if there are more than one hundred bags.
    
    Moisture Testing – After the grain samples are taken, they are mixed and separated through a mixer, then mixed again and separated, until the last twenty centimeters are left, which are used as the grain sample for testing.

    Impurity Analysis – The grain samples are mixed and separated like preparing for moisture testing until the last fifty centimeters remain.

    In order to guarantee the quality and specifications of the grain, the laboratory must master the exact figures of moisture and impurities contained in the grain samples and notify the warehouse of various treatment methods at any time to carry out various storage tasks in a timely manner.

2.  Temperature Checking: When grain enters the warehouse, moisture is tested and impurities are analyzed to determine the quality and the storage method. At the same time, temperature checking is started.

    The three types of temperatures that grain warehouses need to understand are: the outside temperature (ambient temperature), the inside temperature (warehouse air temperature), and the grain temperature (temperature inside the grain pile). Among these, the grain temperature is more important. During the inspection, the upper, middle, and lower layers of the grain pile, the shaded and sunny sides, and the four sides and center should be thoroughly inspected to know the current state of the grain and decide on treatment methods.

    To measure the outside temperature, the thermometer (thermometer) must be hung on a wooden pole in the open space outside the warehouse, with the surface facing the sun. To measure the inside temperature, the thermometer must also be suspended in the air. When measuring the grain temperature, the temperature checker must be familiar with the quality and location of the grain. Grain with high moisture content and many impurities, places where water and snow leak, the part of the surface that is exposed to sunlight through the skylight, and the central part of the high grain pile, the low side part, are most prone to heat and insects, and must be checked first. The number of inspections depends on the season, weather changes, and the amount of moisture in the grain. In general, each pile should be inspected at least once a day. If the grain pile is too large to be fully inspected in one day, it can be divided into several sections and inspected separately in sequence.

    If the grain has a lot of moisture and impurities and it is not winter, it must be checked at least three times a day, and the grain must be probed to observe whether the color and smell are normal. Grain entering the warehouse in winter, with a temperature below zero degrees or not exceeding five degrees, must also be checked daily, because grain with high moisture content or many impurities can also generate heat or mold even in winter. Dry grain should be checked at least twice every five days. The number of inspections should be increased according to seasonal and weather changes. New grain entering the warehouse must be checked every day to master the grain temperature.

    The best time for regular temperature checking is during the time of day when the temperature is highest. If the weather is abnormal, such as after rain turns to sunshine, sunshine turns to rain, wind rises, heavy fog, or low pressure causes sultriness, the grain temperature changes more drastically, so it is necessary to observe the outside temperature at all times. If the temperature rises, even if it is not the scheduled temperature checking time, temperature checking must be carried out. After discovering abnormal temperature, deterioration, or insects, the inspector immediately reports, asks for instructions, and quickly handles the situation, and records it for summary.

    At the same time, in order to enable the personnel in the storage section and the warehouse to understand the specific situation of all grains at any time, the following two reporting systems are stipulated:

    Inspection Daily Report – The temperature checker fills in the daily inspection results according to the columns and indicates the type and location of the grain, and the situation of deterioration and insects.

    Inspection Record Form – The temperature checker also records the daily inspection situation in detail in the form. In addition to recording the temperature inside and outside the warehouse in the temperature column, the grain temperature must record the shaded and sunny sides and the upper, middle, and lower layers of the grain pile. The quality column should record the smell, degree of deterioration, moisture content, and location of the grain pile.

    After grasping the situation of the grain, the grain company's handling method for grain with high moisture content is mainly drying the grain. Generally, it is safer if the moisture content of the grain does not exceed 13% or is below this limit. In terms of controlling temperature, in addition to opening windows for ventilation and turning the piles, the grain company also created a mobile electric wind sifting machine based on the principle of a fixed wind sifting machine, which is specially used for wind sifting grain. Grain sifted by the wind sifting machine can not only lower the temperature, but also remove impurities and insects.

3.  Insect Control: Pests are the perennial enemies of grain warehouses, and if they are not eliminated, they can cause damage to large quantities of grain. There are many ways to eliminate them. The methods used by the company are as follows:

    Using Chemicals – Insecticides include formalin, nickel sulfate, and carbolic acid. To eliminate night robbers (insects attracted to light), a basin of water can be placed under each lamp, with carbolic acid added to the water, so that insects will die when they fall into it. Formalin and nickel sulfate are dissolved into liquid and sprayed directly to kill adult insects and larvae. Spraying the chemicals on the sacks is also effective in killing insects. But it is best to strictly pay attention to cleaning and disinfection before the sacks enter and leave the warehouse, so that insects and insect eggs cannot enter the grain depot.

    Using Manpower – Regularly disinfecting and cleaning the warehouse and plugging the cracks and small holes in the walls is very effective. Weevils have the vitality to hide in the soil five or six inches deep around the warehouse to spend the winter. Therefore, digging the soil around the warehouse one foot wide and one foot deep in winter and dragging the grain bags on the open ground to freeze them is also a good way to eliminate insects. Pouring boiling water on the cracks and small holes on the walls and ground will make the ground warm and humid, and the insects will quickly crawl out, allowing them to be captured and killed. The most effective way to eliminate insects is to organize manpower to catch them. The grain company organized employees to catch insects in the first half of this year and achieved extremely significant results. At the beginning, they could catch more than ten catties a day, but later it decreased. Now it is almost impossible to catch insects. Even if they are occasionally found, they can be caught immediately.

(III) System

If all storage methods are not guaranteed by a system, it is very difficult to do them properly in actual work. The grain company accepted the experience and lessons from last year when a large amount of grain was lost due to the lack of a strict storage system. At the end of last year, after a meeting and research, a warehouse storage system was formulated. All the work in the warehouse, such as storage, weighing, accounting, matching work, night watch, inspection, grain drying, and insect control, are organized and assigned to dedicated personnel. The storage section implements centralized leadership over the warehouse, breaking the phenomenon that responsible comrades of various units dare not take responsibility. At the same time, the storage section and the warehouse also specifically divide work and define the scope of responsibility. For example, if the warehouse unloads too much grain, the reserve materials are insufficient, and the problem is not solved in time, resulting in losses, the storage section is responsible; if the grain in the warehouse has problems, the inspection and reporting are not timely, the grain is not dried when it should be, or it is dried when it should not be, resulting in losses, the warehouse is responsible. This year's insect control work also established an insect control committee. Each warehouse established a group, assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible, delimited boundaries, and assigned a certain number of people to catch insects. Within the scope of responsibility of each group, if insects are found that have not been caught, the group is responsible. Because of this clear division of labor and implementation of a dedicated responsibility system, the sense of responsibility and vigilance of the staff has been strengthened, and work efficiency has been improved. In order to ensure that the storage system can be strictly implemented and adhered to, and to give play to the enthusiasm of the staff, in addition to regular reporting and inspection work between the storage section of the grain company and the various warehouses, a merit campaign was also combined this spring, breaking the conservative idea that everyone thought that "nothing can be achieved in commercial work," making the staff actively use their brains to improve tools, dry grain early, and seize insect control, so that the system can be implemented, and achievements can be made in storage work.

　　旅大粮食公司保管粮食经验
    旅大粮食公司，在今年上半年，建立了保管粮食的工作制度，又创造了某些方法，因而保证了国家财产不受损失。
    （一）获得成绩的关键
    该公司所有的六个仓库，没有一个是现代化的粮仓，最好的是砖墙、铁架、洋灰地。他们今年上半年保管的各种粮食有八九、二五○吨，其中有水分在百分之二十上下的苞米，水分在百分之十七上下的高粱、谷子、大豆，但在所有的保管人员的积极努力下，到七月底为止，不但完成了五万多吨湿粮的晒粮任务，而且全部的损失，包括仓库地上挖起来的去年的残粮在内，只二吨多一点，损失率是四万四千分之一。
    这个成绩的获得，除了工作制度和工作方法以外，最主要的关键是在解决了该公司自上而下存有的经验主义的保守思想。首先打破了过去“四五月间才能晒粮”的保守思想。在二月上旬就召开了所属各粮库主任、检查员和工人的晒粮会议。提出二月晒粮虽然不如五月里上干，但多晒二天也能顶上五月里的一天。领导同志并亲自检查试验晒粮效果，以实际例子教育干部和工人。因此使五万吨湿粮提前晒干，为安全度夏打下基础。
    其次是打破了过去“生虫子是年年有的事，没有法治”的思想。今年四、五月份发现虫子后，领导上便注意了去年防虫子的经验，召开了仓库主任联席会议，研究除虫办法。除了应用去年的风筛、干燥等办法外，还组织了人力捉虫，实行专责制，掀起除虫竞赛。使今年各粮库的虫害根本消灭。
    保守思想的打消，使职工们增加了信心，加上党、政、工、团的配合行动，党、团员带头推动工作，再结合立功运动，发挥了职工们的创造性和积极性，组织人力，多想办法，创造工具，建立制度，实行专责制，因此在很不好的仓库条件下，在上半年战胜了霉烂和虫子这两个粮食保管工作中的敌人。
    （二）三个方法
    一、化验：化验是了解粮食具体情况的一个先决条件。一切粮食在入库当时，必须取样化验，以确定粮食的成份——所含水分、夹杂物的百分比。根据粮食的成份决定进行检温次数、翻晒、捣仓、捣垛、通风、过筛、干燥等工作，以保持粮食的良好品质。其方法如下：
    取样——在一定数量的粮食内取出一小部分，以代表全体，所以取样必须力求正确。该公司的取样方法（汽车或火车所载粮食在入库前就取样）是，汽车中散装粮食按四角和中心点、上下两层取样。汽车中包装粮在一百袋以上，每十袋取样一个。火车中散装粮取样要根据车厢大小决定。仓库散粮每一百立方米在中间及四角取样。仓库码垛取样在一百袋以上，每十袋取一个样。
    水分化验——粮样取来后，通过混合器混合后分开，再混合再分开，直至剩下最后二十公分，作为化验用粮样。
    夹杂物分析——也像准备水分化验一样把粮样混合分开，到剩下最后五十公分为止。
    为了保证粮食的品质和规格，化验室对粮样中所含的水分和夹杂物的精确数字必须掌握。并且随时以各种处理办法通知仓库，及时进行各种保管工作。
    二、检温：粮食入库时，一面化验水分和分析夹杂物，鉴定品质，确定保管方式，另一方面就着手进行检温。
    粮食仓库需要了解的三种温度是：库外温度（大气常温），库内温度（库内气温）和粮食温度（粮堆内部温度）。其中粮温更为重要，检查时需对粮堆上中下层、阴阳面、四围和中心，都该详细检查，才可能随时知道，粮食现在处于什么状态之下，而决定处理办法。
    测量库外温度，须把温度计（寒暑表）挂在库外空地木杆上，使表面向阳。测量库内温度，温度计也须悬空挂置。测量粮食温度时，检温员要熟知粮食的品质和放置地位。水分大，夹杂物多的粮食，漏水、雪的地方，满面天窗透光的部分，堆积较高粮堆的中心部，低边部，最易发热、生虫，须首先注意检查。检查次数根据季节的不同、天气变化和粮食水分的多少而定，一般的每堆至少每日检查一次。如粮堆过大，在一天内不可能全面检查时，可分成几段，分别先后逐段检查。
    如果粮食水分很大，夹杂物较多，又非冬季，每天至少检查三次，并探出粮食，观察色泽气味是否正常。冬季入库粮食，温度在零度以下或不超过五度，也须每日检查。因水分大或夹杂物多的粮食，即在冬季也能发烧或霉烂。干燥的粮食每五天至少检查二次。根据季节和天气的变更增加检查次数。新入库粮食为了掌握粮温必须天天检查。
    平时检温时间最好在一天中温度最高的时间进行。如果天气不正常，在雨后转晴，晴后下雨，起风，大雾，低气压引起闷热等情况下，粮温变化更厉害，就须时刻观察库外温度，如温度升高，即使不在规定检温时间，也须进行检温。检查员在发现温度失常、变质、生虫等情况后，即马上报告、请示，急速处理，并记录以备总结。
    同时，为了使保管科和仓库中人员都能随时了解所有粮食的具体情况，规定了如下的两种表报制度：
    检查日报——由检温员把每日检查的结果，按栏填写，并注明粮食种类和位置，变质生虫情况。
    检查记录表——也由检温员把每日检查情况详细记在表内。温度栏除记仓库内外温外，粮温须记阴面阳面和粮堆的上中下三层。品质栏要记明粮垛的气味，变质程度，水分大小和位置。
    在掌握了粮食的情况后，粮食公司对于水分大的粮食的处理办法，主要是晒粮。一般粮食所含水分在不超过百分之十三或在这个限度之下，比较安全。在控制温度方面，除了开窗通风，倒垛翻垛以外，粮食公司还根据固定风筛机的原理，创造了一种流动式电动风筛机，专门用来风筛粮食。经过风筛机筛过的粮食，不单温度可降低，还可除去夹杂物和虫子。
    三、除虫：害虫是粮食仓库的长年的敌人，如不加以消灭，就足以使大批粮食遭受损害。消灭它们的方法很多，该公司所用的方法如下：
    用药剂的——除虫药剂有佛尔马林、硫酸尼革镇、石炭酸等。除夜盗虫，可在每个灯下放一盆水，水里放石炭酸，虫一跌下去就死。佛尔马林、硫酸尼革镇则溶解成液体后，直接喷杀成虫和幼虫。或把药剂喷在麻袋上，杀虫也很有效。但最好是在麻袋出入库前，严格注意进行清扫和消毒，使虫和虫卵不可能进入粮库。
    用人力的——经常做消毒和清扫仓库、堵塞墙缝和小洞，很见效力。象鼻虫有能在库仓四周五六寸深泥土下藏着度冬的活力。所以在冬天将仓库周围泥土挖出一尺宽，一尺深，将粮袋拖在空地上冻也是除虫的很好办法。用开水烫墙上、地面的裂缝和小洞，地见热水发暖有了潮气，虫子就会很快爬出来，即予捕杀。最有效的除虫方法是组织人力捉虫，粮食公司今年上半年组织职工捉虫，获得极显著成绩。开始一天能捉十几斤，以后就减少，目前几乎捉不到虫子，就是偶有发现，也可立即捉掉。
    （三）制度
    一切保管方法如果没有制度来保证，要在实际工作中做得恰到好处是很困难的。粮食公司接受了去年因为没有严格的保管制度而致损失大批粮食的经验教训，在去年年底经过开会研究，制订了仓库保管制度。仓库中所有保管、过秤、会计、配工、打更、检查、晒粮、除虫等工作，都组织专人负责。保管科对仓库实行集中领导，打破各单位负责同志不敢负责现象。同时保管科和仓库也具体分工，划定责任范围。如仓库卸粮太多，备品不足，解决问题不及时而遭到损失，由保管科负责；仓库粮食发生情况，检查汇报不及时，叫晒不晒，不叫晒而晒，因之遭受损失，由仓库负责。今年的防虫工作，也成立了防虫委员会。各仓库建立小组，指定专人负责，划分界限，指定一定人数捕捉。在每组的责任范围内，如果发现没有捉净的虫，就由该组负责。由于这样明确分工，实行专责制，加强了职工们的责任感和警惕性，提高了工作效率。为了使保管制度能严格执行和坚持下去，发挥职工们的积极性，粮食公司保管科和各仓库之间，除了经常的汇报和检查工作以外，今年春天还结合了立功运动，打破了过去大家都以为“商业工作干不出什么成绩来”的保守思想，使职工们积极开动脑筋，改进工具，提早晒粮，抓紧除虫，使制度得以贯彻，在保管工作上才获得了成绩。
