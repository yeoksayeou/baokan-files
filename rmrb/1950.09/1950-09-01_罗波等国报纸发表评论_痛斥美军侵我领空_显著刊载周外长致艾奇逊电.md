Xinhua News Agency, Prague, August 31st: European democratic newspapers have prominently published Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's telegrams to Acheson and the UN Security Council on the 27th, strongly protesting the U.S. aircraft's invasion of our airspace and the killing of our people, and have successively published articles sternly condemning the U.S. government's criminal acts of aggression against China and attempts to expand the war.

　　The Romanian Workers' Party organ, "Scânteia," published a commentary on the 29th stating: China's note to the Security Council demonstrates that the Chinese government has the firm will to liberate all of China's territory and, at the same time, to do everything possible to defend world peace and crush the criminal plans of the imperialist aggressors. "Scânteia" pointed out: The American warmongers are using every possible means to expand the war to the entire Asia. It is not accidental that U.S. planes bombarded and strafed peaceful Chinese residents at the very moment that the Security Council received China's request to discuss sanctions against U.S. aggression against Taiwan. The new U.S. policy toward Asia is based on open aggression.

　　The Warsaw newspaper "Życie Warszawy" pointed out in an editorial entitled "U.S. Expands Aggression": The U.S. air bandits' attack on China "is not the first hostile act of U.S. adventurers against China." After carrying out aggression against Korea, the U.S. military surrounded China's territory of Taiwan. The newspaper, in denouncing the shameless lie of the U.S. government that Taiwan had been occupied by Japan in the past and declared that it belonged in fact to Japanese territory, said: "This sounds as if Poland, Czechoslovakia, France, etc., were in fact German territories." "Trybuna Ludu" commented on the provocation of U.S. planes invading our airspace, pointing out that the United States had finally torn off its mask, and Truman's attempt to defend the American aggression against Korea and Taiwan in the United Nations was extremely bad.

　　"L'Humanité" in France stated in its commentary: "Taiwan is Chinese territory. The American imperialists do not care much about this. What the American imperialists are concerned about is how to prepare for war against the Soviet Union and China. And MacArthur does not conceal from the American imperialists that Taiwan is the pivot in their aggression plan. In this case, Truman's letter to the Security Council on the 28th, stating that the United States wants to make Taiwan 'neutral,' is an obvious conspiracy aimed at concealing the true intentions of the United States, and these true intentions have been revealed by MacArthur."

　　The London "Daily Worker" also pointed out that MacArthur's statement exposed "the real purpose of American war policy, which is why it was ordered to be withdrawn."

　　罗波等国报纸发表评论
    痛斥美军侵我领空         
    显著刊载周外长致艾奇逊电
    【新华社布拉格三十一日电】欧洲民主报纸均以显要地位刊载我周恩来外长二十七日为严重抗议美国飞机侵入我国领空，射杀我国人民而分别致艾奇逊与联合国安理会的电报，并纷纷著论严斥美国政府侵略中国，并企图扩大战争的犯罪行为。
    罗马尼亚工人党机关报《火花报》二十九日发表评论称：中国致安理会的照会说明：中国政府有坚决的意志，要解放中国全部领土，同时要尽一切力量来保卫世界和平，并粉碎帝国主义侵略者的犯罪计划。火花报指出：美国战争贩子们正在用一切可能的办法来把战争扩大到整个亚洲，正当目前安理会接到中国要求讨论制裁美国侵略台湾的问题时，美国飞机轰炸与扫射中国的和平居民，并不是偶然的。美国对亚洲的新政策已基于公开的侵略。
    波兰华沙报在题为《美国扩大侵略》的专论中指出：美国空中强盗对中国的袭击“并不是美国冒险者对中国的第一次敌对行动”。在进行对朝鲜的侵略后，美国军队便围住了中国的领土台湾。该报在斥责美国政府借口台湾过去曾被日本占领而宣布它在事实上属于日本的领土的无耻谎言时说：“这听起来好像是说波兰、捷克、法国等在事实上都是德国的领土一样。”波兰自由战士报在评论美国飞机侵入我国领空挑衅一事时指出：美国已最后撕去了它的假面具，杜鲁门企图在联合国中为美国的侵略朝鲜与台湾辩护是极劣的。
    法国人道报著论称：“台湾是中国领土。美国帝国主义者对于这一点是不大在乎的。美帝国主义者所注意的，就是如何准备反对苏联和中国的战争。而麦克阿瑟对于美国帝国主义者把台湾当作他们侵略计划中的枢纽这一点并不加以隐瞒。在这种情况下，杜鲁门二十八日致函安理会说美国要使台湾‘中立’，就是一种明显的旨在掩饰美国真实意图的阴谋，而这种真实意图，恰恰被麦克阿瑟泄露了。”
    伦敦工人日报也指出：麦克阿瑟的声明暴露了“美国战争政策的真正目的，因此才被下令予以撤销”。
