Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: Since Truman issued a statement on the 14th regarding a peace treaty with Japan, which violates the principles of the Potsdam Declaration, reports from American news agencies openly admit that the United States' attempt to use its majority vote in the Far Eastern Commission to achieve a unilateral peace treaty with Japan is aimed at accelerating the rearmament of Japan, annexing the Ryukyu Islands, and openly using Japan as a tool and base for the United States to expand its war of aggression in the Far East. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 15th, quoting "authoritative sources," various departments of the United States government have agreed that the peace treaty with Japan should: "(1) impose no restrictions on Japanese armaments; (2) authorize the stationing of American air, naval, and land forces in Japan after the signing of the treaty; (3) grant the United States strategic United Nations trusteeship over Okinawa and other Ryukyu Islands. This is tantamount to the United States merging these islands... The United States can establish bases on these islands and prohibit United Nations representatives from visiting these bases."
    Actively preparing for a unilateral peace treaty with Japan, allowing the United States to openly continue arming and occupying Japan, is a major part of the United States' overall war preparation plan. The United States is trying to force Britain, France, and other countries to endorse its Japan policy. Prior to the U.S., British, and French foreign ministers' meeting in New York on the 12th, an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 9th revealed that "according to the highest policy decision of the United States," the United States would "seek an early peace treaty with Japan" at the three-foreign ministers' meeting. Furthermore, according to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from New York on the 15th, when British and French Foreign Ministers Bevin and Schuman arrived in the United States, Acheson "immediately and secretly" informed them of the United States' decision to unilaterally initiate preliminary talks on a peace treaty with Japan. The dispatch also stated that the United States' decision announced by Truman on the 14th "is consistent with the United States' policy put forward at the New York tripartite conference."
    The United States' treacherous attempt to unilaterally make peace with Japan is a violation of the interests of the Japanese people and the people of the Far East. Therefore, this conspiratorial plan of the United States will inevitably be met with unanimous opposition from peace-loving people all over the world.

### 美国积极准备对日片面媾和图公开继续武装及占领日本

　　美国积极准备对日片面媾和图公开继续武装及占领日本
    【新华社二十二日讯】自杜鲁门于十四日发表违反波茨坦宣言原则的关于对日和约的声明后，美国通讯社的报道公开承认，美国企图利用其在远东委员会的多数票来实现对日片面媾和的目的，是在于加速重新武装日本，吞并琉球群岛并公开利用日本为美国在远东扩大侵略战争的工具及基地。据合众社华盛顿十五日电引“权威人士”谈话称：美国政府各部门都已同意对日和约应该是：“（一）对日本军备应不加任何限制；（二）在和约签订后，授权美国空、海、陆军驻在日本；（三）给予美国对冲绳岛及其他琉球群岛的战略性的联合国托管权。这等于美国合并这些岛屿……美国可以在这些岛屿上建立基地，而且禁绝联合国代表访问这些基地”。
    积极准备对日片面媾和，使美国公开继续武装及占领日本，是美国整个备战计划的主要一环。美国力图迫使英、法等国附和美国的对日政策。在这次美、英、法三国外长会议于十二日在纽约召开以前，据美联社华盛顿九日电透露，“按照美国最高政策决定”，美国将在三外长会议上“觅取早日对日媾和”。又据法新社纽约十五日电称，当英、法外长贝文与舒曼到达美国后，艾奇逊“立即秘密地”把美国将片面地发起对日和约初步会谈的决定告诉了他们。该电并称：十四日由杜鲁门宣布的美国这一决定，“是与纽约三强会议上所提出的美国政策相一致的”。
    美国背信弃义地企图片面对日媾和，是违背日本人民及远东人民的利益的。因此，美国这一阴谋计划，必将遭到世界爱好和平的人民的一致反对。
