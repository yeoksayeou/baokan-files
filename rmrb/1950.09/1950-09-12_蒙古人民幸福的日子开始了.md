　　The Happy Days of the Mongolian People Have Begun

　　(I) Past Suffering

　　Ulanqab League covers an area of approximately 390,000 square li, a vast grassland. Due to the continuous devastation caused by the reactionary rule of the Manchus, Japanese invaders, and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, the local people lived in extremely backward and impoverished conditions. For example, there was only one primary school for the more than 4,000 Mongolian people in the entire Siziwang Banner. Among the 250 herders in the Xilehada area, only seven had a rudimentary knowledge of Mongolian. Poor herders wore tattered clothes and worn-out boots. The yurts were covered with a few pieces of broken felt, and when it rained, the inside of the yurts leaked. Diseases and disasters frequently attacked the herders and their livestock. Currently, the entire Ulanqab League has a population of about 100,000, of which about 25,000 are Mongolian. They are scattered across approximately 290,000 square li of grassland. Sometimes, one could ride a horse for a whole day without encountering a single household. The population here has been declining for many years. Fourteen years ago, Siziwang Banner had more than 6,500 people, but now it has decreased by 28 percent. The decline in livestock numbers is even more alarming. When the Japanese invaders first occupied Siziwang Banner, the entire banner had about 350,000 sheep, but now, including the "civilian land" (Ulanqab League refers to agricultural areas as civilian land), there are a total of 117,000 sheep, a decrease of more than two-thirds.

　　Why have the population and livestock numbers in Ulanqab League declined so drastically? According to preliminary understanding, the main reasons are as follows:

　　First, venereal diseases are the main cause of the population decline in Ulanqab League. We have statistically analyzed the general situation of 100 married women giving birth: 26 women have one child, and only eight women have three children. The rest are mainly unable to give birth due to venereal diseases. Venereal disease is a fairly common and serious disease among the Mongolian people. According to a preliminary investigation by the Peking University Anti-Syphilis Team in Siziwang Banner: among 242 herders in the Xilehada area, 64 percent had syphilis, and among 200 herders in the Bainaimiao area, 75 percent had syphilis. In addition, there are many patients with gonorrhea and soft chancre.

　　The main causes of venereal diseases are inseparable from the long-term reactionary rule. Three hundred years ago, the Manchus implemented the vicious "Ten Policies for Destroying the Mongols" in Mongolian areas, vigorously promoted Lamaism, and forced men to become lamas. Taking Siziwang Banner as an example, lamas accounted for more than 36 percent of all men in the banner. The number of men who could marry gradually decreased. In addition, during the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, they rampantly drafted men and soldiers and massacred progressive youth, creating an abnormal phenomenon of more women than men. Currently, apart from lamas, there are twice as many women as men in the entire Ulanqab League, and many women cannot find marriage partners. Although lamas are not allowed to marry here, it has become an open secret that they are promiscuous, which has made male-female relationships extremely chaotic. We saw many women like Ying Gejima on the grassland: she was forced to have sexual relations with men as early as the age of thirteen, began to comb her hair with an axe at fifteen (combing hair is a sign of married women in Mongolia), became a Chabuganqi (Mongolian nun, still living at home, and can marry) at the age of twenty-five, and still has many boyfriends coming and going. Secondly, the feudal marriage system is also one of the reasons for the abnormal male-female relationships. In the past, marriages were basically arranged or bought and sold by the Sumuda (equivalent to the district head), and women were in an oppressed position. The marriage age for men was often twice that of women, and many women were forced to marry men they did not love, and even cases of forced marriage occurred.

　　Second, medical and health conditions are very poor. There are no clinics or hospitals on the grassland. When ordinary herders are seriously ill, most of them ask lamas to chant scriptures. We saw a herder in Santaicun who was bitten by a mad horse. After the lama chanted scriptures, he told him that he could not go out or cross the river for a hundred days, and the wound would heal. But after more than seventy days, the herder's condition had worsened. Occasionally, there are "quack doctors" from outside who not only fail to cure the disease but also try to extort the herders' cattle and sheep. One herder spent six sheep to treat a small carbuncle on his foot. We calculated that even if the medicines used by this "doctor" were priced ten times higher, including the treatment fee, it would only cost 36,000 yuan RMB, which is less than half a sheep. But it is not easy for herders to hire such "doctors."

　　The reasons for the decline in livestock numbers, in addition to the rampant levies and plunder during the rule of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits, also include wolf attacks, freezing disasters, and livestock diseases.

　　Since 1938, the Japanese invaders forcibly requisitioned more than 10,000 heads of livestock from Siziwang Banner every year. After the Chiang Kai-shek gang replaced the Japanese invaders in 1945, in addition to the rampant levies, they also carried out ruthless plunder. Siziwang Banner collected more than 1,200 sheep for consumption every winter, and a large number of horses were requisitioned for military use. According to the decline in livestock in the banner from 1946 to 1949, the number of horses decreased by 7,393, sheep decreased by 21,747, and camels decreased by more than 530 (some of which were lost due to wolf attacks, freezing disasters, and diseases) in three years. Danbao Erque, a herder living in Naobaotou, had to drive his cattle and sheep to the mountains every day to spend the night in order to avoid the plunder of the Chiang Kai-shek army. He said: "At that time, even your boots would be taken away if you encountered bandits (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek army)."

　　Wolf attacks are the most serious of the disasters. Ulanqab League has about 360,000 livestock, and an average of about 20 percent of livestock are eaten by wolves every year. Qu Lu, a herder in Maoming'an Banner, had 27 horses, large and small, and nine (seven foals) were eaten by wolves last year. Three hundred sheep of Wangqingsi Road in Darhan Banner were killed by wolves in one night. The losses caused by livestock diseases are second only to wolf attacks. Taking the cattle plague that occurred in Darhan and Siziwang Banners this year as an example, 800 cattle died. Sheep are generally covered with mange and suffer from a "Hate" (Mongolian) disease, with a mortality rate of about 10 to 20 percent. Due to the lack of wood on the grassland and the increasing poverty of the herders, livestock do not have sheds or corrals, and some do not even have fences. Freezing disasters occur in some colder areas in winter and spring. In the winter of 1947, 50 percent of the 150 sheep of Baoyintuoge in the Second Sumu of Siziwang Banner froze to death. In the freezing disaster in May of this year, 568 sheep and more than 50 horses froze to death in the six Sumu of the banner. There are no veterinarians on the grassland. The herders have long been subjected to feudal superstitious propaganda and education, and they have always "left it to fate" regarding wolf attacks and diseases. They say: "Wolves are celestial dogs, and the more you fight them, the fiercer they become"; cattle plague is a "plague god descending," and in addition to burning incense and praying, they ask lamas to chant scriptures, without prevention or treatment, which causes a large number of livestock deaths.

　　(II) Moving Towards a New Life

　　Since the liberation of Ulanqab League half a year ago, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Ulanqab League Autonomous Government, the construction of a new Ulanqab League has begun. In April of this year, the first session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles in the League unanimously adopted a resolution to implement the victory over diseases and disasters and move towards "prosperity of both people and livestock," and decided to launch a "wolf-fighting and livestock-protecting" movement. In mid-April, the wolf-fighting movement was generally launched in various banners. Nearly a thousand herders in the East Three Banners (accounting for 10 percent of the population of the East Three Banners) are conducting this sensational movement on the grassland under the leadership of the Wolf-Fighting Movement Committee organized by the banner government. Sixty women and thirty lamas also participated. In the first wolf-fighting campaign, in just twenty days, a total of 1,095 wolves of all sizes were killed in the six banners of the League, exceeding the total task of killing 1,050 wolves throughout the year. The creativity of the masses was brought into play in the wolf-fighting movement, and many heroic models emerged. Darhan Banner used the method of encirclement and suppression to prevent cunning female wolves from escaping. Na Ge Daoerji killed eighteen wolves by himself and won the title of "Wolf-Fighting Hero." Baoyin Bilige, the banner chief of Siziwang Banner, led four wolf-fighting teams and personally killed seven wolves. He showed bravery, resourcefulness, hard work, and responsibility in his leadership, and won the admiration and love of the people of the entire banner. Since the wolf-fighting movement began, wolf attacks have not been as rampant as in the past. Most herders not only recognized the correctness of the leadership of the Communist Party and the strength of their own forces, but also broke the superstitious idea that "wolves are celestial dogs, and the more you fight them, the fiercer they become."

　　Under the slogan of "prosperity of both people and livestock," the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government's cattle plague prevention and treatment team went to the East Three Banners twice from March to May this year to carry out the work of eradicating cattle plague. Although some livestock were still lost due to the lack of timely work and the insufficient allocation of medical and prevention team personnel, more than 90 percent of the sick cattle were cured after treatment. More than 3,000 cattle in Siziwang Banner have been vaccinated, which has basically eliminated cattle plague in the banner. Now, in order to protect and develop animal husbandry, the Ulanqab League Autonomous Government has mobilized herders to carry out work such as mowing grass, building fences, and building sheds. The Suiyuan Branch of the People's Bank of China has also issued livestock loans of 140,000 jin of millet to help herders solve their difficulties.

　　With the coordinated implementation of various tasks, the herders' enthusiasm for production has been improved. Wherever we go, we can see those hardworking women working from morning to night. They cherish their livestock as if they were their own children, sleeping next to the sheep at night and guarding their flocks.

　　What is most warmly welcomed by the Mongolian people in Ulanqab League is the syphilis prevention and treatment team sent to Ulanqab League by the Suiyuan Provincial Health Bureau and the Peking University Anti-Syphilis Team from Beijing. With the assistance of the Ulanqab League Banner Government, they have focused on carrying out syphilis treatment and investigation work. In less than half a month after the Peking University Anti-Syphilis Team arrived in Dahu La and Bainaimiao in Siziwang Banner, more than 600 herders from all over the area gathered to be examined. Herders from Tuhemu, sixty miles away from Dahu La, also came to be examined in the rain. The herders of the Seventh Sumu, hearing that these were doctors specially sent by Chairman Mao from Beijing to treat them, were willing to come for examination whether they were sick or not. Many herders said with emotion: "The world of the Communist Party has really changed drastically. In the past, you couldn't find such good doctors even if you spent money!"

　　We once met a woman in Naobaotou who had just recovered from syphilis. Her name was Erke Jima. Three months ago, syphilis had made her unable to move, and her hair had fallen out. She said: "At that time, I really didn't think I could survive." After being treated by the provincial medical and prevention team, Er Gejima's hair grew back, and she could do everything from herding sheep to milking cows. When she talked about the medical and prevention team, she was moved to tears. She said: "The League Banner Government is helping us eliminate the enemies of people and livestock - syphilis and wolves. The happy days of our Mongolian people have truly begun."

　　Naturally, on this land that has been plundered and ravaged by reactionaries for a long time, the disasters of the Mongolian people are still profound. Currently, more than 90 percent of syphilis patients are eager to receive treatment. Wolf attacks and diseases still pose a considerable threat to the herders' livestock. Today, all the construction work of our new Ulanqab League has just begun, and it is still far from the requirements and hopes of the Mongolian people. For example, we do not yet have a comprehensive and well-planned plan on how to completely eradicate syphilis in the entire Ulanqab League; in addition to treatment, this plan must also include how to conduct education and necessary reforms of some old systems to make male-female relationships normal and reasonable. Regarding the protection of pastures and animal husbandry, we have had incidents of forcibly reclaiming pastures and randomly buying livestock (especially female livestock) in pastoral areas in the past, which have affected the development of animal husbandry. In the future, special attention should be paid to earnestly implementing the people's government's policy on "protecting pastures and animal husbandry" and helping the people of Ulanqab League build this relatively backward area.

### 蒙古人民幸福的日子开始了

　　蒙古人民幸福的日子开始了
  （一）过去的苦难
    乌兰察布盟的面积约三十九万平方里，是一片辽阔广大的草原。由于过去连续遭受满清、日寇、蒋匪等反动统治的摧残，当地人民生活在极其落后与穷困的苦境中。举例来说，整个四子王旗四千多蒙民中只有一所小学。惜勒哈达一带二百五十个牧民，粗识蒙文的只有七个人。贫苦的牧民，穿着褴褛的衣服和磨透了底的靴子。蒙古包铺着几片碎毡，下雨的时候，包里漏满了水。疾病和灾害经常袭击着牧民和他们的牲畜。现在，全乌盟约有十万人口，其中蒙民约二万五千人。他们散居在大约二十九万平方里的草地上。有时骑马走一天也遇不见一户人家。这里的人口多年来不断地在下降着。四子王旗十四年前有六千五百余人，现在减少了百分之二十八。牲畜数字的下降更是惊人。日寇初侵占四子王旗时，全旗有羊约三十五万只，现在连同“民地”（乌盟称农业区为民地）在内，共有羊十一万七千只，减少了二倍多。
    乌盟人畜数字为什么会这样下降呢？据初步了解，主要原因有以下几种：
    第一、性病是造成乌盟人口下降的主要原因。我们统计一百个已婚妇女生育的一般情况：生一个孩子的有二十六人，生三个孩子的只有八人，其余主要均由于性病关系而不能生育。性病是蒙民中相当普遍而严重的疾病。据北京大学抗梅队在四子王旗初步调查：惜勒哈达一带二百四十二个牧民中，梅毒患者占百分之六十四，白乃庙一带二百个牧民中，梅毒患者占百分之七十五。此外，还有不少的淋病、软性下疳等患者。
    造成性病的主要原因，与长期的反动统治是分不开的。三百年前，满清在蒙地施行毒辣的“灭蒙十策”，大倡喇嘛教，并强迫男子出家当喇嘛。以四子王旗为例，喇嘛即占全旗男子百分之三十六以上。可以结婚的男子逐渐减少，再加上蒋匪帮统治时期大肆拉夫抓兵和屠杀进步的青年，造成了女多男少的畸形现象。现在，除开喇嘛外，全乌盟女子比男子多一倍，很多女子找不到结婚对象。这里喇嘛虽不准结婚，而乱找女人已成公开事实，这使男女性关系异常混乱。我们在草地见到不少像英的格玛这样的女子：她十三岁已开始被迫同男子发生性关系，十五岁拜斧子梳头（梳头是蒙地女子已婚的标帜），二十五岁当查不干齐（蒙地尼姑，仍留居家中，并可结婚），现在仍有很多男友来往。其次，封建的婚姻制度也是造成男女性关系不正常的原因之一。这里过去基本上是由苏木达（相当区保长）包办或买卖婚姻，女子处于被压迫的地位。结婚年龄，男子往往超过女子一倍，很多女子被迫和她们所不爱的男子结婚，甚至有抢婚事件发生。
    第二、医药卫生条件很差。草地没有一所诊所和医院。一般牧民病重时，多数去请喇嘛医念经。我们在三台村见到一位被疯马咬伤的牧民，喇嘛念经后告诉他一百天不能出门，不能过河，伤就会好的。但已经过了七十多天，这位牧民的伤势反更加重了。这儿偶尔也有外来的“江湖大夫”，有时不但治不好病，而且设法敲诈牧民的牛羊。有一位牧民治脚上一个小痈，就花了六只羊。我们计算一下，把这位“大夫”所用的药品，都以十倍计价，连同治疗费在内，一共不过三万六千元人民币，连半只羊都用不了。但是像这样的“医生”，牧民也是不容易请到的。
    牲畜数字下降的原因，除日寇和蒋匪统治时期进行暴征与掠夺外，与之俱来的还有狼害、冻灾和畜病。
    一九三八年以来，日寇向四子王旗一地每年强征牲畜万余头。从一九四五年蒋匪帮代替日寇统治后，除暴征外，并进行无情的掠夺，四子王旗每年冬季征收食用的羊，即达一千二百多只，大批的马被征作军用。根据该旗一九四六年到一九四九年牲畜下降的状况看，三年来马减少七千三百九十三匹，羊减少二万一千七百四十七只，骆驼减少五百三十余只（其中有一部分是受狼害、冻灾、疾病的损失）。住在脑包头的一位牧民丹包阿尔却为了躲避蒋匪军的掠夺，过去每天都赶着牛羊到山上去过夜。他说：“那时候碰见土匪（指蒋匪军）连靴子也要被脱走的”。
    狼害是灾害中最严重的一个问题。乌盟大约有三十六万牲畜，而每年平均被狼吃掉的牲畜有百分之二十左右。茂明安旗牧民屈路有大小二十七匹马，去年被狼吃去九匹（有七匹小马）。达尔罕旗王庆寺路三百只羊，一夜被狼咬死三十只。牲畜因疾病而受到的损失仅次于狼害。以今年达尔罕和四子王两旗所发生的牛瘟为例：牛死亡达八百头。羊普遍长癞和生一种“哈特”（蒙语）病，死亡率也在百分之十到二十左右。由于草地木材缺乏与牧民的日趋贫困，牲畜没有棚圈，有的甚至连围墙也没有，每逢冬春两季，在部分较寒冷地带即发生冻灾。一九四七年冬，四子王旗二苏木宝音托格一百五十只羊冻死一半。今年五月的冻灾，全旗六个苏木冻死羊五百六十八只，马五十余匹。草地没有兽医。牧民长期受封建迷信的宣传教育，对于狼害和疾病一贯是“听天由命”。他们说：“狼是天狗，愈打愈凶”；牛瘟是“瘟神下降”，除焚香祈祷外，便是请喇嘛念经，亦不加以预防与治疗，这便造成牲畜大量的死亡。
    （二）走向新的生活
    乌盟解放后半年以来，在共产党及乌盟自治政府领导下，已开始了新乌盟的建设工作。今年四月间，全盟首届各界人民代表会议一致通过贯彻执行战胜疾病和灾害，走向“人畜两旺”的决议，并决定了开展“打狼保畜”运动的计划。四月中旬，打狼运动即在各旗普遍展开。东三旗有近千（占东三旗人口百分之十）的牧民在旗政府所组织的打狼运动委员会领导下，进行这一个轰动草原的运动。参加的并有妇女六十名、喇嘛三十名。第一次打狼，仅二十天时期，全盟六个旗共打死大小狼一千零九十五只，超过全年计划打狼一千零五十只的总任务。打狼运动中发挥了群众的创造性，并涌现出很多的英雄模范，达尔罕旗用循环围剿的方法，使狡猾的母狼亦无法逃脱。那格道尔吉一个人打死十八只狼，获得“打狼英雄”的称号。四子王旗旗长宝音比利格领导四个打狼组，并亲自打死七只狼。他在领导中表现了勇敢、机智、刻苦、负责的精神，博得全旗人民的敬仰与爱戴。自从打狼运动进行后，狼害已不像过去那样猖獗。大部分牧民不仅认识了共产党领导的正确和自己力量的强大，而且打破了过去“狼是天狗，愈打愈凶”的迷信思想。
    在“人畜两旺”的号召下，内蒙自治政府牛瘟医防队从今年三月到五月曾两度到东三旗进行扑灭牛瘟的工作。虽然因工作不够及时，同时医防队人员不敷分配，仍有部分牲畜遭到损失。但经过治疗后，百分之九十以上的病牛都好了。四子王旗经防疫注射的牛有三千多头，使该旗牛瘟基本上已经肃清。现在，乌盟自治政府为保护和发展牧畜，已发动牧民进行打草、盖圈、搭棚等工作。人民银行绥远分行并发放畜牧贷款十四万斤小米，帮助牧民解决困难。
    在各项工作配合进行下，牧民生产情绪提高了。我们走过的地方，到处都会看到那些辛勤的妇女们，从早到晚都在劳动着。她们像爱护自己孩子一般的爱护自己的牲畜，夜晚睡在羊群的旁边，守护着自己的羊群。
    最受到乌盟蒙民热烈欢迎的，还是绥远省卫生局派往乌盟的梅毒医防队和由北京去的北大抗梅队。他们在乌盟盟旗政府的协助下，有重点地进行了梅毒治疗与调查工作。北大抗梅队到达四子王旗大虎拉和白乃庙两地不到半月时间，从各地聚集来检查的牧民，就有六百人以上。离大虎拉六十里的土和木的牧民也冒雨来检查。第七苏木的牧民们，听说这是毛主席特别从北京派来给他们治病的医生，有病没病都愿意来检查，很多牧民感动的说：“共产党的天下，真是大变了，过去花钱也找不到这样好的医生啊！”
    我们在脑包头曾经遇见一位梅毒初愈的妇人，她名叫儿克吉玛。三个月前，梅毒病已使她不能行动，头发都秃落了，她说：“那时候真没想到自己还能活下去。”经过省医防队治疗后，儿格吉玛头发重新长出来了，放羊、挤奶样样劳动都能做了。当她谈到医防队的时候，感激得留下泪来。她说：“盟旗政府帮助我们消灭人和牲畜的仇敌——梅毒和狼，我们蒙古民族幸福的日子是真正开始了。”
    自然，这块曾经被反动派长期搜刮、掠夺和蹂躏的土地上，蒙民的灾难还是深重的。现在，还有百分之九十以上的梅毒患者渴望得到治疗。狼害和疾病依然相当严重的威胁着牧民的牲畜。今天我们新乌盟的一切建设工作刚刚开始，距蒙民的要求和希望仍然很远。如：关于如何彻底肃清全乌盟的梅毒，我们还没有一个全面而周密的计划；这个计划除治疗外，还必须包括如何进行教育和对一些旧制度的必要改革，使男女性关系走向正常合理的途径。关于保护牧场和牧业方面，我们过去曾发生过强垦牧场和在牧地乱买牲畜（尤其是母畜）的事情，这些都影响了畜牧业的发展。今后特别要注意认真执行人民政府关于“保护牧场和牧业”的政策，好好帮助乌盟人民把这块比较落后的地方建设起来。
