CCP Wangdu Three-Dyke Village Branch in Hebei
Reports Leading Production and Harvest
Mobilizing the Masses to Plan for Increased Production Next Year, Striving to Produce More Grain to Combat Aggressors

[Our Newspaper] Correspondent Zhu Zhongzhi reports: All the members of the Communist Party of China (CCP) Three-Dyke Village Branch in Wangdu County, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting that they played an active leading role in production. The masses' efforts in one year of production and the implementation of government policies rewarding cotton planting and encouraging improved agricultural technology have resulted in a harvest this year that exceeds previous years. They also reported that they are already mobilizing the masses to make production plans for next year, to increase grain production further, and to strengthen the forces against imperialist aggression. The original letter is as follows:

Dear Chairman Mao:

The first anniversary of the birth of our great People's Republic of China – October 1st – is coming. In this year, thanks to your wise leadership and the united efforts of the military and civilians across the country, China today is very different from China a year ago. This year, all the people of our Three-Dyke Village are living glorious and happy days after the basic liberation of the mainland, actively and peacefully carrying out the production movement. As we celebrate this great National Day anniversary, all the party members of our Three-Dyke Village are writing to you with the happiest of hearts to thank you for your wise leadership and to tell you about the harvest situation in our village this year.

All the party members in our Three-Dyke Village have remembered the sentence in the Common Program that says, "...Love of the motherland, love of the people, love of labor, love of science, and care for public property are the public virtues of all citizens of the People's Republic of China." We all understand that labor is glorious and laziness is shameful. Therefore, we have all actively plunged into the upsurge of the great production movement and have played an exemplary leading role in various production tasks. Over the past year, we have achieved great results. Today, we are reporting these achievements to you as a gift from all our party members for National Day.

First, let’s talk about planting cotton: Our village planted 1,605 mu of cotton last year, and the task for this year was 2,000 mu. Through the party members’ combination with village cadres in grouping and segmenting to conduct in-depth propaganda, and through the leading role of the party members as backbone, we completed 2,920 mu. Even Su Qingshan, who was skeptical about planting cotton in the past, planted 13.5 mu of cotton after in-depth publicity and mobilization (he has a total of 16.5 mu of land). Therefore, our branch was awarded the title of Model Branch for cotton planting.

In addition, we have achieved careful and meticulous cultivation. This year, we generally plowed the land twice, with 40 percent of the land plowed three times; 40 percent of the land was hoed four times. Cotton fields were hoed six times for 65 percent of the area, and some were hoed seven times. We also ensured timely pruning, removing side shoots, and eliminating pests and diseases. In terms of fertilization, last year we used four cartloads of grass manure and 45 jin of sesame cake per mu; this year, we used five cartloads of grass manure and 70 jin of sesame cake.

Due to the deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and large-scale fertilization this year, the harvests have exceeded previous years. Speaking of cotton alone, last year the average yield was 95 jin per mu, and this year the average yield is expected to be 120 jin. It is estimated that the village will harvest 350,000 jin of cotton. Because of the bumper cotton harvest, the masses are so happy that they can't close their mouths. They all say that this year's bumper cotton harvest is due to Chairman Mao's good leadership. Farmer Su Luoxian said, "I will plant whatever you tell me to plant in the future, and I will surely harvest more." Two sentences are widely circulating among the masses in our village: "If you want to improve your life, you must follow Mao Zedong."

But we also have a shortcoming, which is that "organizing to allocate labor for mutual assistance" has not been done well. There are only three labor allocation groups in the village. We have already made a self-criticism and are prepared to work hard in this area.

In order to continue to carry out large-scale production next year, all our party members have launched extensive publicity and mobilization among the masses. Due to the leading role of the party members, the masses throughout the village are making production plans for next year. According to preliminary statistics, the village plans to keep 3,500 mu of cotton fields, 600 mu more than this year. Although 407 mu less wheat will be planted than last year, we will plow and cultivate carefully, and strive to plant less wheat but not harvest less wheat. We plan to promote 72 wheat on 588 mu. Because of this year's bumper harvest, we already have the strength to increase livestock, farm tools, and water conservancy projects. We plan to increase livestock by 35 heads next year and replace small donkeys with good donkeys; increase large carts by 15, hoes by 30, increase waterwheels by 25, and dig 10 new wells. In order to increase fertilizer, we are planning to carry out a large-scale pig raising campaign. Next year, we will produce more grain to support the front lines, rapidly liberate Taiwan and Tibet, consolidate national defense, oppose American imperialist aggression, and defend world peace.

With respect! And wishing you eternal good health!

All members of the Three-Dyke Village Branch of the CCP in Wangdu County, Hebei Province

　　中共河北望都三堤村支部
    报告带头生产和丰收
    正发动群众作明年增产计划争取更多打粮食打击侵略者
    【本报讯】通讯员朱忠智报道：中共河北省望都县三堤村支部全体党员，写信给毛主席，报告他们在生产中起了积极带头作用，群众在一年生产中的努力，和实行了政府奖励植棉、鼓励改进农业技术的政策，使得今年收成超过了往年。并报告他们已经在发动群众作明年的生产计划，要更多增产粮食，增强反对帝国主义侵略的力量。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们伟大的中华人民共和国诞生的一周年纪念日——十月一日到来了。在这一年当中，由于你的英明领导和全国军民的一致努力，今天的中国和一年前的中国又大不相同了。这一年，我们三堤村的全体人民，在过着全国大陆基本解放后的光荣幸福的日子，积极而又安心地开展着生产运动。在庆祝这个伟大的国庆纪念日的时候，我们三堤村的全体党员，带着最快乐的心情来给你写信，感谢你对我们的英明领导，并告诉你我们村子今年的丰收情形。
    我们三堤村全体党员，都记住了共同纲领上所说的“……爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物为中华人民共和国全体国民的公德。”这句话，我们都了解劳动是光荣的，懒惰是耻辱的。因而我们都积极地投入了大生产运动的热潮中，并在各种生产工作中起了模范带头作用。一年来，得到了很大的成绩。今天我们将这些成绩报告你，作为我们全体党员对国庆日的献礼。
    先说种棉花吧：我们村去年种棉一千六百零五亩，今年的任务是二千亩。经过党员结合村干部分组、分片深入宣传与党员的骨干带头作用，我们完成了二千九百二十亩。就连过去对种棉有怀疑的苏庆山，经过深入宣传动员，也种棉十三亩半（他共有地十六亩半）。因此，我们支部获得了植棉的模范支部的称号。
    此外，我们做到了精耕细作。今年普遍作到了耕两遍，其中百分之四十的地耕了三遍；有百分之四十的地锄了四遍。种棉花地百分之六十五锄了六遍，有的还锄了七遍。并做到了及时的整枝、打杈及消灭病虫害。在施肥方面，去年我们每亩使草粪四车、麻饼四十五斤，今年施草粪五车、麻饼七十斤。
    由于今年作到了深耕细作及大量施肥，收成都超过了往年。光说棉花一项，去年平均每亩收九十五斤，今年平均可收到一百二十斤。估计全村可收棉花三十五万斤。因为棉花丰收了，群众欢喜得合不上嘴。都说今年棉花丰收是毛主席领导得好。农民苏洛献说：“以后叫你种什么你就种什么，准能多收”。我村群众普遍流传着这样两句话：“要想生活向上升，就得跟着毛泽东。”
    但我们也有一个缺点，即“组织起来拨工互助”做得较差。全村只有拨工组三组。我们已做了检讨，准备在这方面努力。
    为了明年继续开展大生产，我们全体党员已向群众展开了广泛宣传动员。由于党员的带头，全村群众正在作明年的生产计划。据初步统计，全村准备留棉田三千五百亩，比今年多种六百亩。虽然比去年少种麦四百零七亩，但要深耕细作，努力做到少种麦而不少收麦。准备推广七二小麦五百八十八亩。因为今年丰收，我们已有力量增加牲畜、农具和兴修水利。准备明年增加牲口三十五头，并将小驴换成好驴；增加大车十五辆、耠子三十个、增加水车二十五辆、打新井十眼。为了增加肥料，我们正计划开展喂大猪运动。明年要更多地增产粮食，好支援前线，迅速解放台湾和西藏，巩固国防，反对美帝的侵略，保卫世界和平。此致敬礼！并祝你身体永远健康！
        中共河北省望都县三堤村支部全体党员同启
          九月二十四日
