    [Our Newspaper] Korean combat hero, Quan Zonghuan, the Korean representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, met with Chinese combat hero Li Guoying today. They exchanged cordial greetings and sincere respect to the people's armies of China and Korea. Li Guoying had previously traveled to Korea with the Chinese People's Representative Delegation to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the liberation of Korea. He said: He personally witnessed the heroic and skillful combat performance of the People's Army in Korea. This spirit greatly encouraged the fighting will of the Chinese and Asian people to resist the aggression of American imperialism. He powerfully stated: The fraternal forces of China and Korea will unite closely in the future and fight to defeat the common enemy, the war instigators. Quan Zonghuan said: The historically significant great victories already achieved by the Chinese People's Liberation Army have long been praised and cheered by the whole world. The young Korean People's Army should learn from the Chinese People's Liberation Army's thirty years of rich combat experience and work hand in hand for lasting peace and national independence.
