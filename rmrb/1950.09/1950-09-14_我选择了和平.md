　　I Chose Peace
    (6)
    In April 1950, General Keilly, commander of the Rhine Army (i.e., the British occupation forces in Germany), was standing behind the bar selling wine at the British Press Club in Berlin, casually toying with a wine glass, and said to me:
    "Not long ago, I discussed everything with Munch (i.e., Montgomery - note by Pitt), and he fully agreed with my opinion: it is necessary to rebuild the German army as soon as possible. Although some political groups are still opposed, we will soon achieve our goal."
    From the confidence and natural attitude expressed by the general when he spoke, one can draw a conclusion: these words were not unusual for him. Obviously, he had said such things more than once in various official meetings and among high-ranking officials.
    The plan of the Western powers, under the leadership of the United States, to rebuild the German army and the complete disregard for the Potsdam Agreement, which aimed to eradicate German militarism, was no longer a secret to me. The attempt by the American ruling group to recruit the West German army had been fully exposed at least two years ago. However, the details of these plans and the British commander-in-chief in Germany's cheerful and open determination to announce his full agreement with the Americans, and the citation of the same position of Field Marshal Montgomery, commander-in-chief of the "Western European Union" forces, were new to me.
    Since 1948, the British and American authorities have begun to restore the influence and power of West German industrialists and Nazis, whom Hitler used to incite the war in 1939. It is worth pointing out that newspapers in the West, both in Germany and outside Germany, have tried their best to prevent the broad public from realizing the seriousness of all the crises caused by the West German re-militarization policy.
    A Major Brukel of Hitler's General Staff participated in the formulation of a plan in 1944, which stated that the officer corps must be rebuilt after Germany's defeat. This fact was revealed by Brukel. I personally telegraphed this news to London, but the Western newspapers were completely silent.
    From these exposures and other facts, it can be understood that after a quiet period following Germany's defeat, the officer corps and war participant groups gradually became active. Their conflict with the Bonn "government" is temporarily irreconcilable. News leaked from Bonn fully proves that the above-mentioned plan is now in the final stage of implementation: in a few weeks, or at most a few months, a new German army will be established, which will be the army of American employers.
    From colleagues working in West Germany, I learned that many young British officers and officials are now seeking the possibility of consulting with former senior German officers, hoping to rebuild the German army in the near future, so that the officers contacted can obtain favorable positions.
    In Berlin, the restoration of German militarism is not as significant as in West Germany. However, here, one can now more often see the "incumbent" old Nazi officers and diplomats. I will only give one example to illustrate: Rutte, who claims to be a Social Democrat and is the mayor of West Berlin, has an assistant named Obert. This gentleman's face is covered with scars, and he himself likes to talk about the "lovely times" when he was an official in Hitler's embassy in Vienna from 1934 to 1938. At that time, the embassy controlled many clues of Austrian Nazi activities. It organized the assassination of Prime Minister Dolfuss and prepared the foundation for Hitler's occupation of Austria in March 1938.
    Mr. Obert may not be directly responsible for all these crimes, but he himself does not want to prove that he did not participate in these matters. On the contrary, he never misses an opportunity to boast that he was an official of the embassy.
    During the two and a half years that I worked as a Reuters reporter in Berlin, the accuracy of the news about Berlin and East Germany published in British and American newspapers has continuously declined.
    During the preparation for the All-German Youth Congress in Berlin at the end of May 1950, those reports were particularly hysterical and openly inciting. The plan to hold this conference was announced in early February. As usual, I and some of my colleagues reported the news to our company. Also, as usual, news about this situation was not published. Two or three weeks later, the infamous Schumacher declared that he had obtained "secret information" that an army of 500,000 members of the Free German Youth League seemed to be planning to "violently occupy Berlin" on the day of the conference. Therefore, he asked the occupation authorities to send tanks to "defend" the western part of Berlin.
    Schumacher's hysterical roar of this conspiracy was published on the front pages of Western newspapers under large headlines. Reporters sent out telegrams of thousands of words, talking about "the plan of communist thugs," talking about "Russians who tried to occupy the West Berlin radio station, all dressed in plain clothes" and other imaginary fabrications. Some of these messages were the fruits of their own imagination, and some were excerpts from West Berlin newspapers.
    This entire slander campaign continued for three full months. As for honest and sober reports that showed no signs of anything other than powerful demonstrations for peace in the democratic area of Berlin, there was no chance of publication. In March, I kept reporting this kind of "futile" communications to London. Then I received an angry telegram, questioning why I did not report at all on the "terrorist incidents" that other reporters were paying special attention to.
    The days of May came, and the Western powers and their German servants did their best to incite hatred and terror: reinforcements arrived in Berlin, West Berlin police armed themselves with tear gas, and the American army held a very strange exercise in Grunewald, during which a group of soldiers playing the role of "communist marchers" sang their self-compiled "Volga Thug Song"...
    At the same time, famous American politicians made provocative speeches across the ocean, threatening that if a young peace fighter crossed the border of the western district of Berlin, an atomic bomb would be dropped.
    The reports fabricated by the reporters contributed to the war hysteria propaganda to some extent, but they themselves did not take their threatening reports seriously. As a result of this propaganda, some officials in the Western government moved their families out of Berlin in mid-May. As for the reporters, who had taken such similar actions, I did not know.
    All this made me so disgusted, so I made up my mind: the time has come to refuse to play the role of transporting gunpowder for the war merchants. With the help of honest reporting, I can definitely promote the construction of a better world - this hope is no longer a fantasy. I am seriously considering: how can I truly serve the cause of peace.

### 我选择了和平

　　我选择了和平
    （六）
    一九五○年四月，莱因军（即英国驻德占领军）司令凯利将军站在柏林不列颠记者俱乐部中卖酒的柜台旁，一边随便地玩弄着酒杯，一边对我说：
    “不久以前，我曾与蒙奇（即蒙哥玛利——皮特注）讨论了一切事情，他完全同意我的意见：需要尽快地重建德军。某些政治团体虽然还在反对，但是我们不久总可以达到自己的目的。”
    从这位将军说话时所表示的那种自信和自然的态度，可以得出一个结论：这些话对于他并不是不寻常的，显然，在各种官方会议和高级官员中，他已不止一次地说过这种话了。
    西方列强在美国领导下，重建德军的计划以及对于旨在铲除德国军国主义化的波茨坦协定的完全蔑视，在我看来早已不是什么秘密了。美国统治集团企图征募西德军的事情，至少在两年前就已完全暴露了。但是，这些计划的细节和不列颠驻德总司令如此愉快而公开地决心宣布自己与美国人的充分协议；而且引证“西欧联盟”军总司令蒙哥玛利元帅的同一立场这件事，对于我却是新鲜的。
    从一九四八年起，英美当局就开始恢复西德工业家和纳粹分子的影响与威力，希特勒曾借助于这些人在一九三九年煽起了战争。这是值得指出的：不论在德国或德国以外的西方报纸，都竭力阻止广大的舆论界意识到西德重新军国主义化政策所引起的一切危机的严重性。
    希特勒参谋总部的一位少校布鲁开尔，曾于一九四四年参加制订一项计划，其中说到德国失败后必须重建军官团。这一事实被布鲁开尔揭露出来。我个人曾把这个消息发电到伦敦去，但是西方报纸却都完全沉默着。
    从这些暴露和其他事实中可以明白，德国战败以后，经过了一个安静时期，军官团体与战争参加者团体就逐渐活跃起来，他们与波恩“政府”之间的冲突暂时还不能调和。从波恩泄露出来的消息充分证明：上述的计划，现正处在实现的最后阶段：再经过几个星期，或者最多经过几个月，新德国军队将被建立起来，这支军队将是美国雇主们的军队。
    从在西德工作的同事的口中我弄明白：许多年青的英国军官和官吏现在正寻求着与从前德军高级军官协商的可能性，他们希望在不久的将来重建德军，使所联络的军官们获得有利的位置。
    在柏林，德国军国主义的恢复，到如今还没有像西德那样显著。但是，在这里，现在更经常地看得到“正在上任的”旧纳粹军官和外交官了。我只举一个例子来说明：自称社会民主党人同时是西柏林市长的鲁特尔，他有一位助手名叫什么奥泊尔特。这位先生的脸上满布伤痕，同时他自己喜欢谈起那些“可爱的时光”，即他在一九三四——一九三八年时曾是希特勒驻维也纳大使馆中的一名官员。这个大使馆当时掌握着奥地利纳粹活动的许多线索，它组织了对总理道尔夫斯的暗杀并为希特勒一九三八年三月占领奥国准备好基础。
    奥泊尔特先生，也许不是这一切罪行的直接负责人，但是他自己也不想证明他并未参与这些事。相反地，他从不放过夸耀自己是该大使馆一名官员的机会。
    我做路透社记者在柏林的两年半时间中，英、美报纸所刊载的关于柏林及东德的消息的确实程度，是连续地下降了。
    在筹备一九五○年五月底柏林全德青年大会的期间，那些报道尤其带有歇斯特里和公开煽动的性质。举行这一大会的计划是二月初公布的。和往常一样，我和我的一些同业们都把这个消息向本社报道了。同时，也和往常一样，关于这种情形的消息没有刊登出来。过了两三个星期，臭名昭彰的舒马赫声明，他获得“秘密消息”，说是，自由德国青年联盟盟员的五十万大军似乎计划在大会那一天要“暴力占领柏林”。因此，他向占领当局请求派遣坦克以“保卫”柏林的西部地区。
    舒马赫这种阴谋的歇斯特里的咆哮，以大号标题刊登在西方报纸的第一版。记者们拍出长达千言的电报，谈到“共产主义暴徒的计划”，谈到“企图占领西柏林广播电台的俄国人，都换上了便服”以及其他幻想的捏造消息。这些消息有的是他们自己幻想的果实，有的是从西柏林报纸上摘录下来的。
    这整个的诽谤运动继续了整整三个月。至于，说到柏林民主区除了强有力的保卫和平的示威游行，看不出其他任何迹象的那一种诚实的清醒的报道可就没有任何公布的机会了。三月间，我一直向伦敦报道着这一类“白费劲”的通讯。于是我收到了激怒的电报，质问我有什么理由丝毫不报道其他记者们所异常注意的“恐怖事件”。
    五月的日子来到了，西方列强及其德国的从仆们尽力煽动憎恨及恐怖：增援部队到达了柏林，西柏林警察武装了摧泪弹，而美国军队在哥鲁尼瓦尔德举行了异常奇怪的演习，演习时一群扮演“共产主义游行者”的士兵，大唱其自编的“伏尔加暴徒之歌”……
    同时著名的美国政治家却在海洋彼岸发出挑拨性的演说，威吓着说，如果有一个青年和平战士越过了柏林西区的界限，就要投掷原子弹。
    记者们所捏造的通讯是多少助长了战争歇斯特里的宣传的，然而他们自己却没有认真对待自己这些威吓性的报道，这种宣传的结果，西方官厅便有一些职员在五月中把家属迁出了柏林。至于记者们，谁曾有过这样类似的行动呢，我却没有知道。
    这一切情况使我如此厌恶，于是我下了决心：拒绝再做为战争贩子服务的运输火药的角色的时间已经来到了。借助于诚实的报道，我一定可以促进建设更好的世界——我这一个希望已经不再是幻想了。我认真地考虑着：我要怎样地真正为和平事业服务。
