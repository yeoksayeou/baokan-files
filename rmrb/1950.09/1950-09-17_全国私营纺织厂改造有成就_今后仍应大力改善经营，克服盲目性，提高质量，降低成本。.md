　　[Reported by our special correspondent Yu Liting] In the past six months, private cotton textile factories nationwide have achieved certain successes in their transformation, laying the foundation for further normal development in the future. Before liberation, private cotton textile factories generally exhibited irrational phenomena such as prioritizing speculation over operation and business over management. In 1949, major cotton textile industrial areas across the country were liberated successively. Due to four price fluctuations, private textile factories generally continued their past habits, with little or no transformation to suit the needs of the new democratic economy. After the nationwide financial and economic unification in March of this year, and with prices beginning to stabilize, the latent weaknesses of private textile factories were exposed. Some factories, having withdrawn funds before liberation, found it difficult to maintain operations and shut down. Most factories suffered from poor management and heavy losses. Only a small number of well-managed factories were able to move forward steadily. Taking private textile factories in Shanghai as an example, of the total losses incurred in the ten months from liberation to the end of March this year, excessively high interest rates on debt and wasteful consumption accounted for about 70 percent, while losses due to the disconnection between cotton yarn and fabric prices accounted for about 20 percent. In order to adjust industry and commerce and support private textile industries that benefited the national economy and people's livelihood, the People's Government purchased finished products on one hand and supplied raw cotton (including some foreign cotton) on the other, entrusting processing, spinning, and weaving. It is estimated that commissioned spinning accounted for 78 percent of the total spinning volume of all private yarn factories, and commissioned weaving accounted for 75 percent of the total volume. At the same time, the People's Government, based on the medium standards of cotton textile factories in various regions, appropriately increased labor fees, helping private textile factories to gradually transform and maintain self-sufficiency. Over the past few months, this work has achieved great success, and private cotton textile factories nationwide have basically begun to improve. Factories in North China have been able to obtain considerable profits on a monthly basis since April. Even the Shanghai private yarn factories, which faced the greatest difficulties, had gradually repaid two-thirds of their old debts by the end of June. Most manufacturers were close to breaking even, and some manufacturers, such as Hongfeng and Zhaofeng, even had a slight surplus. Recently, a new trend of reducing commissioned spinning and increasing self-spinning has emerged. Cotton textile factories in Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China have overcome temporary difficulties due to the care of state-owned enterprises, and those with better management have been able to obtain profits.
    During this period, workers of various yarn factories actively united with capitalists, took the lead in overcoming difficulties, such as reducing treatment, saving to maintain capital, improving technology, improving quality, reducing costs, and launching production competitions, demonstrating a high degree of production enthusiasm, promoting capitalists to improve management from commissioned spinning, and recognizing new paths, thereby greatly moving and improving the capitalists' enthusiasm for management. Bulky institutions began to undergo gradual transformation. The five textile factories of the Shanghai private Shenxin system established a general management office in May, adjusted some unreasonable salaries, and reduced excessive business affairs personnel. Shanghai Rongfeng Yarn Factory dismissed five managers, deputy managers, and senior staff, as well as ten "consultants" who received fixed salaries. Hangzhou First Yarn Factory originally had as many as seven managers, deputy managers, assistant managers, and deputy assistant managers, and also underwent streamlining. Chongqing Yuhua Yarn Factory also adjusted the unreasonable system of senior staff receiving special salaries. During this period, the output of private textile factories in various regions generally increased gradually. Tianjin Private Beiyang Yarn Factory's average output of 20-count yarn per spindle in 20 hours was 0.8018 pounds in March this year. By May, the highest reached 0.926 pounds, and although the weather was hot in June, it still reached 0.8809 pounds. Shijiazhuang Daxing Yarn Factory's average output of 20-count yarn per spindle in 24 hours in February this year was 1.03 pounds. It gradually increased month by month after March, reaching 1.097 pounds in May. In Shanghai, the average output of 20-count yarn per spindle in 20 hours for all private yarn factories was only 0.7 pounds in March. It gradually normalized from April, and by June this year, it had increased to 0.82 pounds. Suzhou's Sulun Yarn Factory's output per spindle in 20 hours in April was 0.7 pounds, and in June, it reached 0.84 pounds. Jiangyin Liyong Yarn Factory's output per spindle before liberation was 0.7 pounds, and now it has reached 0.87 pounds, with a maximum of 0.92 pounds. Yarn factories in Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China also saw an increase in output, and the situation of weaving cloth also increased proportionally. Due to the government's supervision of private textile factories to deliver goods according to certain specifications in commissioned spinning and weaving, the quality of finished products was promoted. Shanghai, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places have successively begun pre-inspection systems.
    Due to the increase in production, the lives of workers have also been relatively improved. The Hengyuan, Beiyang, and Dasheng yarn factories in Tianjin, and the Daxing yarn factory in Shijiazhuang have all gradually improved the welfare of their workers due to the improvement of production and the factory's profit. Facts have proven that only by doing a good job in production can we improve our lives.
    From the national scope, we can see a situation that, in addition to the government's care and supervision, the regions and factories where labor-capital consultation meetings were established earlier and achieved success generally have better production and management conditions. For example, the factories in North China, followed by some yarn factories in Shanghai and Southern Jiangsu. Therefore, factories that have not established labor-capital consultation meetings should establish labor-capital consultation meetings, and those that have been established should strengthen their organizational structure and enrich their content.
    However, there are still many problems existing in private textile factories. Some capitalists have the idea of long-term dependence on the government, one-sidedly emphasizing objective difficulties, and demanding to increase the raw cotton in commissioned spinning and increase labor fees, while forgetting their own transformation and whether the transformation has reached reasonable operating standards. Some capitalists even show terrible deceptive behavior—in the process of commissioned spinning and weaving, there have been many phenomena such as cutting corners, replacing raw cotton, swapping bad cloth, shoddy workmanship, and insufficient quantity. There were even events of delaying the delivery of commissioned yarn and cloth while privately selling it. Many factories still retain bloated institutions, and some capitalists are unwilling to offend relatives and friends, adopting a passive avoidance attitude, while always wanting to make plans on the workers. Some capitalists are afraid of trouble and lack the spirit of careful calculation, and there are still serious waste phenomena in the factory, making it difficult to maintain capital. Some manufacturers, seeing that self-spinning is profitable, do not try to solve the raw material problem themselves, but one-sidedly demand that the government sell raw cotton at a low price; manufacturers in certain regions, regardless of whether the raw materials are sufficient, add new spindles without applying to the government, or start work without a plan, privately working overtime, only seeking private interests. The vast majority of manufacturers have not yet paid attention to improving quality, and the quality of finished products is generally low. Among the 23 factories in Shanghai that have been inspected for commissioned spinning and weaving, only 13 have yarn and cloth that meet the standard of Grade B or above. In addition, the finished products of factories in Northern Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places are almost all below the standard. Therefore, it is necessary to further correct shortcomings and continue the transformation. Overcoming the blindness and anarchy of production, improving production and management methods, improving product quality and reducing costs are the main goals of the private textile industry in the future.

　　全国私营纺织厂改造有成就
    今后仍应大力改善经营，克服盲目性，提高质量，降低成本。
    【本报讯】特约通讯员俞鲤庭报道：全国私营棉纺织厂在过去半年的改造过程中，获得了一定的成就，奠定了今后进一步走向正常发展的基础。解放之前，私营棉纺织厂，一般地说来，存在着投机重于经营，业务重于管理等不合理的现象。一九四九年内，全国主要棉纺织工业地区先后解放，因物价曾四次波动，私营纺织厂仍一般地继续着过去遗留下来的积习，没有改造或很少改造，以适合新民主主义经济的需要。今年三月全国财经统一，物价开始稳定以后，私营纺织厂潜存的弱点一起暴露出来。部分工厂由于解放前将资金抽逃，难以维持，停工关厂；大部分工厂由于经营不善，赔累不堪；只有小部分经营较善的厂家，才能稳步前进。以上海私营纺织厂来看，自解放至今年三月底止的十个月内，亏损的总数字中，由于借债所负的过高拆息及消耗浪费，即占百分之七十左右，因花纱价格脱节而致亏损的占百分之二十左右。人民政府为了调整工商业，扶助有利国计民生的私营纺织工业，曾一面收购成品，一面供给原棉（内有一部分外棉），委托加工代纺代织。估计代纺的数字占全部私营纱厂的纺纱总量的百分之七十八，代织的数字占总量的百分之七十五。同时人民政府根据各地棉纺织厂的中等标准，适当提高工缴，帮助私营纺织厂逐步改造，保本自给。几个月来，这一工作获得了很大的成就，全国私营棉纺织厂基本上已开始好转。华北各厂，从四月份起，已能按月获得了相当利润。即以困难最大的上海私营纱厂而论，到六月底止，也已陆续偿还旧欠纱布三分之二；大部分厂家已接近保本；若干厂家如鸿丰、兆丰等且已稍有盈余。最近并已出现减少代纺增加自纺的新趋势。中南、西南、西北地区的棉纺织厂，由于国营企业的照顾，度过了暂时的困难，经营较好的已可获得利润。
    在这期间内，由于各纱厂职工的主动团结资方，带头克服困难，如减低待遇，节约保本，改进技术，提高质量，降低成本，发动了生产竞赛等，发挥了高度的生产热情，推动资方从代纺中改善经营，认清新的道路，从而大大地感动了和提高了资方的经营的积极性，臃肿的机构开始有了逐步的改造。上海私营申新系统的五个纺织厂，于五月起成立了总管理处，调整了部分不合理的薪给，减少了过多的业务事务人员。上海荣丰纱厂，裁汰了经、副理及高级职员五人，拿干薪的“顾问”十人。杭州第一纱厂原有正副经理、协理、襄理达七人之多，也进行了精简。重庆裕华纱厂也调整了高级职员拿特别薪不合理的制度。在这期间，各地私营纺织厂的产量都一般地逐步上升。天津私营北洋纱厂今年三月平均二十支纱每锭二十小时生产○．八○一八磅，到五月份，最高已达○．九二六磅，六月份天气虽热，仍达○．八八○九磅。石家庄大兴纱厂今年二月二十支纱每锭二十四小时平均产量是一．○三磅，三月以后逐月提高，至五月份已达一．○九七磅。上海方面，全部私营纱厂三月份二十支纱二十小时每锭平均产量仅○．七磅，四月起逐渐正常，到今年六月提高到○．八二磅。苏州的苏纶纱厂四月份二十小时每锭产量是○．七磅，六月份到达○．八四磅。江阴利用纱厂解放前每锭产量是○．七磅，现已达○．八七磅，最高到○．九二磅。中南、西南、西北地区的纱厂，产量也都有了提高，织布的情形也同样成正比例的上升。由于政府在代纺代织中，督促私营纺织厂按一定的规格交货，促进了成品品质的提高。上海、苏南、苏北、浙江等地，并先后开始事先的检验制度。
    由于生产的提高，职工的生活也得到相对的改善。天津的恒源、北洋、达生，石家庄的大兴等纱厂都由于生产的改善，厂方获得了盈余，也逐步改善了职工的福利。事实证明，只有搞好生产，才能改善生活。
    从全国的范围内可以看出一种情况，即除了政府的照顾和督促之外，凡是劳资协商会议成立较早，而获得成绩的地区和工厂，生产和经营情况一般地也较好。例如华北的各厂，其次是上海苏南的若干纱厂。因此，未成立劳资协商会议的工厂应成立劳资协商会议，已成立的加强其组织机构，充实其内容。
    但是，存在于私营纺织厂中的问题仍然很多，有些资本家存在着长期依赖政府的思想，片面强调客观困难，要求增加代纺中的原棉，提高工缴，而忘了自身的改造，和改造的是否已达到合理的经营标准。有些资本家更表现恶劣的欺骗行为——在代纺代织加工中间，发生过不少的偷工减料，抽换原棉、掉换坏布、粗制滥造、数量不足等现象，甚至有一面拖交代纺纱布，一面私自出售的事件。许多工厂中间依然保存着臃肿的机构，有些资本家不愿得罪亲戚朋友，采取消极逃避，另方面却总想在工人头上打算盘。有些资本家怕麻烦，缺乏精打细算的精神，在工厂里仍然有严重的浪费现象，难以做到保本。有些厂家见到自纺有利，自己不设法解决原料，而是片面要求政府廉价出售原棉；某些地区的厂家不顾原料是否充足，不向政府申请即添加新锭，或则是不按计划开工，私自加班，只求私利。绝大部分的厂家还没有重视质量的提高，成品的品质一般是低下的。经过检验的上海代纺代织的二十三家工厂中，纱布合乎乙级以上标准的只十三家。此外苏北、浙江等地工厂的成品几乎全在标准之下。因此，还必须进一步的纠正缺点，继续改造。克服生产的盲目性和无政府状态，改善生产经营方式，提高产品质量和减低成本，为今后私营纺织业中主要的努力目标。
