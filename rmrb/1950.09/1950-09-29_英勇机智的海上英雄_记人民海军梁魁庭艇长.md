Heroic and Resourceful Naval Hero
    ——In Memory of People's Navy 艇长 Liang Kuiting
    Bai Sheng
(I)
    艇长 Liang Kuiting's Liberation gunboat, after participating in the Hainan Island liberation campaign and successfully completing its mission, quickly accepted the glorious task of liberating the Wanshan Islands. In this battle, his gunboat and two other gunboats took on the responsibility of being the first line of attack, cooperating with the army in attacking Lajiwei Island in the Wanshan Islands.
    At 2:00 AM on the night of May 25th, they began their advance towards Lajiwei on the pitch-black sea. Because signal communication was impossible at sea, the Liberation gunboat lost contact with the other two gunboats. At dawn, the Liberation gunboat sailed near Miaowan Bay of Lajiwei, and suddenly discovered that more than 20 enemy ships, large and small, of the Second Fleet were anchored in the arc-shaped bay.
    It was clear that the Liberation gunboat could only attack the enemy's Second Fleet alone, attracting the enemy's forces, allowing the other gunboats to cover the army's smooth landing, otherwise, the landing might be hindered.
    Under these circumstances, 艇长 Liang Kuiting resolutely made the decision to attack the enemy's Second Fleet. Once the decision was made, the Liberation gunboat charged straight into the harbor. The enemy flagship "Taihe" fired a burst of machine gun fire from 2,000 meters away, frantically trying to escape out of the harbor with another enemy ship, the "Zhongzi" class. Some enemy ships started up in a panic without even having time to raise their anchors. The enemies on the ships, bare-chested, ran around on the deck, shouting and crowding together. They never dreamed that a small gunboat could sail across the sixteen-nautical-mile-wide sea in the pitch-black night, arrive among this group of ships with a total tonnage three hundred times greater than its own, and dare to charge straight ahead.
    Seizing this good opportunity, the bullets and shells of the Liberation gunboat roared furiously. 艇长 Liang Kuiting directed while shouting: "Comrades, fire!" Machine gunner Ou Zhenhua shot down an enemy standing on the bridge of the "Taihe" with a burst of bullets (later it was learned that the one shot down was the commander of the enemy's Second Fleet, Qi Zhihong), and the enemy became even more panicked.
    The Liberation gunboat exerted infinite power, accurately shooting at the bridges, gun positions, and middle cabins of the enemy ships. The enemy ship Zhonghe had been hit by several shells in a row, and thick smoke began to rise. At this time, the enemy's concentrated artillery fire from the enemy ships and the island was like a kaleidoscope, and the harbor with a diameter of one kilometer was turned into a sea of fire. 艇长 Liang Kuiting calmly and flexibly steered the rudder, weaving through the enemy's network of artillery fire. In the chaotic shooting, one enemy ship was set on fire by the shells of another enemy ship.
    Suddenly, with a loud noise, the hull shook violently, and the bow of the Liberation gunboat was hit by a shell. Platoon Leader Zhu Chaoke, who commanded the short-range powerful cannon, heroically sacrificed his life, and gunner Zhao Dongming was also injured. However, the two gunners squatting next to him immediately climbed up, gripped the cannon, and continued firing. Then the right side of the bridge also caught fire after being hit by a cannon, and 艇长 Liang Kuiting was injured in more than ten places on his body and face by shrapnel; he quickly ordered the fire to be put out with sacks and quilts. He resolutely directed the shooting while steering the rudder, skillfully dodging the enemy's artillery fire.
    At this time, two enemy ships blocked the mouth of the bay, cutting off the rear route, and the firepower on the boat had also weakened. Liang Kuiting thought, "Ram the boat over and fight the enemy hand-to-hand." But he felt that this was too uneconomical. He decided to rush out. Suddenly, he discovered a gorge about fifty meters wide in the southeast corner of the harbor, but it was tightly blockaded by the enemy's firepower on both sides. "Rush, we must rush out!" He gripped the steering wheel tightly and rushed straight towards the gorge at top speed, regardless of everything. All the enemy's gunboats and the artillery fire on the island suddenly poured down on the gorge like a storm, and the gunboat was temporarily shrouded in thick smoke, but it immediately emerged again, rushed out of the fifty-meter-long gorge, and sailed straight southeast. Traveling at a speed of fifteen knots per hour for five nautical miles, it finally sailed out of the enemy's fire net. In this battle, Comrade Liang Kuiting's gunboat disrupted the entire Second Fleet of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, sinking two enemy gunboats and damaging the enemy's Taihe and other ships.
    It was just after eight o'clock in the morning, and the Liberation gunboat had been fighting since dawn, entangled with the enemy for three or four hours, completing the task of attracting the enemy's forces and covering the army's successful landing.
    When this small gunboat, carrying more than a hundred shell wounds, returned to its original station after bravely fighting with more than twenty enemy ships, all the brother gunboats cheered enthusiastically. This was a miracle of naval warfare.
(II)
    艇长 Liang Kuiting, who grew up on the sea since he was a child, is now forty-three years old. He is from Nanhai, Guangdong. His grandfather, father, and himself, three generations of them are maritime workers. Because of the poverty of family life, he joined the Kuomintang navy as a sailor at the age of thirteen. Thirty years of reactionary naval life made him suffer from the oppression and enslavement of the Kuomintang, and also see through the Kuomintang's corruption and incompetence. He first thought that as long as he worked hard, the maritime workers would eventually turn over. However, his bravery and efforts finally disappointed him. With full of enthusiasm, such an old seaman with rich experience at sea began to look forward to a new direction. In 1949, when the heroic People's Liberation Army fought to Guangdong, Liang Kuiting was then the deputy艇长 of the enemy's Wufeng gunboat. A new vitality invaded him, so he and the艇长 of the Wufeng gunboat, Li, discussed an uprising. Finally, on October 22, he and all the comrades of the Wufeng gunboat heroically sailed the gunboat directly from Jiangmen to Guangzhou. They heroically revolted and joined the embrace of the people's motherland.
    In the ranks of the People's Navy, they lived and studied happily. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, he had a deeper understanding of the Communist Party's policies and the greatness of the people's power. He constantly demanded progress. This March, when the superiors called for the liberation of Hainan Island, he resolutely requested to participate in the battle, and at the same time encouraged all the seamen comrades of the original Wufeng gunboat. In the battle to land on Lajiwei, he created another miracle. (Attached picture)

　　英勇机智的海上英雄
    ——记人民海军梁魁庭艇长

  （一）
    梁魁庭艇长领导的解放号炮艇，在参加解放海南岛战役，胜利完成任务后，很快的又接受了解放万山群岛的光荣任务。在这次战斗中，他的炮艇和其他两个炮艇，担任了第一线突击，配合陆军进攻万山群岛中的垃圾尾岛的任务。
    五月二十五日夜二时，在漆黑的海面上，他们开始了向垃圾尾的进军。因为在海上不能用信号连络，解放号和其他两个炮艇失掉了连系。拂晓，解放号驶抵垃圾尾庙湾口附近，突然发现在弧形的湾子里，停泊着敌人第二舰队大小二十多艘舰艇。
    事情很明白，解放号只有单独向敌人第二舰队进攻，吸引敌人的兵力，让其他炮艇掩护陆军顺利登陆，否则登陆即可能受到阻碍。
    在这种情况下，梁魁庭艇长果敢地下了决心；向敌人第二舰队进攻。决心既下，解放号就向港湾内直冲进去。敌旗舰“太和号”从两千米外打来一梭机枪，惊惶地想和另一艘敌舰“中字号”向港外逃跑。有的敌舰慌张地连锚也来不及起就开动了。舰上的敌人光着膀子，在甲板上乱跑乱嚷，挤做一团。做梦也没想到，一只小炮艇，能在漆黑的夜里，驶过十六海里宽的海面，来到这全部吨位比它大三百倍的舰艇群中，而且敢于向前直冲。
    抓紧这个好机会，解放号的枪弹、炮弹疯狂地怒吼起来了。梁魁庭艇长一面指挥着，一面喊着：“同志们，打呀！”机枪手欧振华一梭子弹，撩倒了站在“太和号”驾驶台上的一个敌人（后来了解，被撩倒的就是敌人第二舰队司令齐志洪），敌人更加慌乱了。
    解放号发挥着无限的威力，准确地射击着敌舰的驾驶台、炮位、中舱位。敌舰中和号已一连被击中几颗炮弹，冒起了浓烟。这时敌舰与岛上敌军的密集的炮火，像万花筒一样射击着，直径一千米的港湾，打成了一片火海。梁魁庭艇长沉着地灵活地操着舵，在敌舰群的炮火网中穿插着。敌人在慌乱的射击中，一艘敌舰被另一艘敌舰的炮弹打着了火。
    突然一声巨响，艇身猛烈震动，解放号的船头中了一炮。指挥短距离威力炮的朱朝科排长英勇地牺牲了，炮手赵东明也受了伤。但蹲在旁边的两个炮手，立即爬上来，握着炮继续射击。接着驾驶台右侧也中炮着火，梁魁庭艇长身上脸上十多处被弹片迸伤；他迅速命令用麻包、棉被把火扑灭。他坚毅地一面指挥着射击，一面操着舵，巧妙地躲避敌人的炮火。
    这时两艘敌舰封锁了湾口，后路被切断，艇上的火力也已经减弱。梁魁庭想：“把艇撞过去，和敌人肉搏吧。”可是他又觉得这太不合算了。他决心冲出去。忽然他发现在港湾的东南角，有一个宽约五十米的峡口，但被两岸敌军的火力严密地封锁着。“冲，一定要冲出去！”他紧握着舵轮，以最高速度，不顾一切地直朝峡口冲去。敌人的全部炮舰和岛上的炮火，顿时像暴风雨一样向峡口泻来，炮艇一时被浓烟笼罩，但马上又钻了出来，冲出了这五十米长的峡口，直向东南驶去。以每小时十五海里的速度，航行了五海里，最后驶出了敌人的火网。在这次战斗中，梁魁庭同志的炮艇，打乱了蒋匪海军的整个第二舰队，击沉敌炮艇两艘，击伤敌太和号和其他舰艇数艘。
    这时正是早上八点多钟，解放号从拂晓打起，已经和敌人纠缠了三四个钟点，完成了吸住敌人兵力，掩护陆军胜利登陆的任务。
    当这一带着一百多个炮弹创伤的小炮艇，在与二十多艘敌舰进行了英勇搏斗、驶回原驻地的时候，所有的兄弟炮艇都热烈地欢呼着，这是海上战斗的一个奇迹。
  （二）
    从小就生长在海上的梁魁庭艇长，今年已经四十三岁了，他是广东南海人，祖父、父亲、他自己，他们三代都是海员工人。因为家庭生活的贫困，十三岁上就参加了国民党海军做一名小水手。三十年的反动海军生涯，使他受尽了国民党的压迫和奴役，也看透了国民党的腐败无能。他先想只要自己好好干下去，我们海员工人总归会翻身的。然而他的勇敢和努力，最后也终于使他失望了。怀着满腔的热望，这样一个在海上有着丰富经验的老海员，开始对新的方向有所憧憬了。一九四九年当英勇的人民解放军打到广东的时候，梁魁庭当时正在敌舞凤艇当副艇长，一股新的活力侵袭着他，于是他和舞凤艇的艇长李商议起义，终于十月二十二日，他和舞凤艇的全艇同志英勇地把炮艇自江门直驶达了广州。他们英勇地起义过来，投到了人民祖国的怀抱。
    在人民海军的队伍里，他们愉快的生活和学习着，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，使他更深刻的认识到共产党的政策和人民力量的伟大。他不断地要求着进步。今年三月，当上级号召解放海南岛时，他坚决地要求参加战斗，同时还鼓舞了原舞凤艇的全体海员同志。在登陆垃圾尾的战斗中，他又创下了奇迹。（附图片）
