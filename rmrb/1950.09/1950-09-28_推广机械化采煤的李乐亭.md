Li Leting, Promoter of Mechanized Coal Mining
    Lin Li

    In the Hegang Coal Mine of Northeast China, everyone knows Li Leting as an expert in "eating high falls" (Note 1). At the end of 1948, he was recognized as a second-class labor model of the mine for his superior drilling (Note 2) skills. When the new record movement was launched in 1949, his face's output increased by 25.7 percent, and no casualties occurred. Therefore, he made two major contributions to safety production and innovation records. But his greater achievement lies in promoting mechanized coal mining. He overcame the backward thinking of some employees who did not accept new tools and defeated the initial chaos in the implementation of mechanized coal mining with his high organizational skills and leadership art. The strict division of labor, unified cooperation working methods and face committee organization he created promoted the progress of mechanization. It has now been widely promoted in all faces of the Hegang Mine.

  Hegang to Use Machines Instead of Manual Labor

    Since liberation, the Hegang Coal Mine has made two major leaps in coal mining methods. Here, like other coal mines across the country, the ancient "high fall" coal mining method was used. Last year, the trial implementation of the filling longwall method was successful, advancing the backward coal mine production. Mechanization began in May of this year, showing a new situation in coal mine production. That is, using coal cutters to replace manual slotting, using pneumatic picks and electric drills instead of hand-swinging picks, and using card machines and coal chutes instead of manual transportation. Mechanization means a major revolution in production methods, that is, moving from heavy and backward coal mine production methods to a new road to liberate manual laborers.

  Numerous Difficulties Hinder the Implementation of Mechanization

    However, this big change encountered many new difficulties. For example: they don't know how to use the machines when they arrive; they can learn how to use them, but they don't know how to repair them. Although pneumatic picks and electric drills are good, they are not used to operating them for a while, and the coordination of various tasks is not coordinated. Mechanization has begun to close many small faces, and cadres and workers must be re-equipped. People who are new to the new faces are unfamiliar with the place. After going down the pit, the tunneling workers cannot find the location, and the recovery workers do not know where to go, etc., which at one time formed an uneven workload and a large number of "nesting work" (Note 3). This affected the reduction of output, the reduction of wages, and the increase in costs. Some workers complained, and even individual leading cadres doubted the effect of mechanization.

  Li Leting Uses His Brain to Overcome Difficulties

    At this time, Li Leting was working in the No. 103 face of the Xingshan Mine. At first, he also felt that the coal cutter was very loud after it was put down the pit, and it was not as enjoyable as everyone having a pick when eating high falls. However, this expert in "eating high falls" who was famous for swinging a pick did not follow the crowd and rant. He began to change from physical labor to using his brain. He recalled the scene when the high fall style was changed to the filling longwall style. At that time, he also encountered opposition from some people. Li Leting himself personally suggested to the mine manager: "Filling the longwall will not be successful. How good is eating high falls? One shot can produce hundreds of tons of coal?" At that time, the mine manager persuaded him with the principle of "coal mining must protect the mine," and in later practice, it proved that filling the longwall was safe and could improve the recovery rate. Since then, Li Leting has become an active promoter of filling longwalls. He reviewed the reforms since the People's Government accepted the Hegang Coal Mine, and came to the conclusion that "reform is definitely beneficial to workers. The superiors will not 'pit' us." Starting from this simple and plain truth, Li Leting carefully observed and compared various machines. He affirmed that mechanization was more efficient than manual labor in any case. How much effort do workers save by machine coal mining?! The problem now is that we haven't mastered the machines yet.

    He talked about his own ideas and opinions with the workers in the Yushan Mine everywhere, which also stabilized the emotions of the workers.

  High Degree of Organization and Clear Division of Labor

    However, the overall situation after the implementation of mechanization is complex, unlike the era of swinging a pick when "eating high falls," as long as the masses' thoughts are cleared and the masses' confidence is strengthened, and then a few activists take the lead, it can be done. What is needed now is for everyone to master the machines and technology, and it is necessary to use strong organizational skills to guide the masses to the correct path.

    At this time, Li Leting consulted with experienced workers, studied with technicians, and discussed with activists in various groups and teams to strengthen organizational methods. Finally, he discovered that the reason hindering the progress of the work was that there was no strict division of labor in the first place. In the face of mechanization, people are still like when they were swinging picks: they go to coal mining when they are tired of drilling, they are unwilling to mine coal, so they go to support pillars, and sometimes the people who push carts also go to swing picks... This chaotic phenomenon causes "nesting work" waste and uneven workload. From then on, he proposed to change the labor organization and carry out a strict division of labor. The specific method is to divide machinery, coal mining, filling, transportation, etc. into four groups, each with its own responsibilities and not affecting each other. And arrange the working hours and tasks of each group according to the labor process. This overcomes the chaotic phenomenon of blind recklessness and concretely implements the accountability system for the use and management of tools. The administration approved his suggestion, and the efficiency of the No. 103 face quickly increased from 1.9 tons to 2.9 tons.

  Unified Leadership

    Li Leting further reformed the management system. Originally, the three-shift operation here had no contact between shifts. In the past, there was a phenomenon that each shift only cared about producing more coal and did not care about the difficulties of the next shift. In the implementation of mechanization, this situation of each doing its own thing hindered the progress of the work and affected the engineering specifications and safety. Li Leting proposed: break the past management method of dividing only by time, each three shifts form a central group, elect a leader and deputy leader, and grasp the three shifts' production plan and production progress. This can not only promote the unity of employees, strengthen the overall concept, but also strictly enforce engineering specifications and improve the handover system.

  Organize Learning

    While solving the complex problems of strict division of labor and unified cooperation, he organized people to learn technology. Young workers with a cultural level were planned to be assigned to the coal cutter group, and a master-apprentice system was implemented, so they quickly mastered the technology and overcame the difficulty of "machines not listening to people." The advance speed of the coal cutter gradually increased from 10 meters per hour to 35 meters. The coal mining efficiency of direct workers increased from 3.03 tons to 7.55 tons. More importantly, it made people see the function of the machines and strengthened their confidence in comprehensively carrying out mechanization.

  Establish a Face Committee

    Due to Li Leting's efforts, the mechanization movement of the No. 103 face ran ahead of all mechanized faces. The daily output increased from 200 tons to 399 tons in one month. Li Leting believes that the reason why he can come up with various improvement methods is because of his extensive contact with the masses. Therefore, with the development of mechanization, he formed the original informal meeting for soliciting the opinions of employees into a face committee. In addition to absorbing the leaders of each class group, several members were elected from the workers. During the meeting, the central group leader was the chairman by default, and pit leaders and technicians were invited to attend the guidance. The meeting is held once a week to deal with the urgent problems that need to be solved. In addition, it is to check the implementation of the production plan, check the product quality, engineering specifications, safety equipment, and lead technical research. This face committee is essentially a small democratic management committee. The result of the implementation of the No. 103 face is to closely connect the leaders and the masses, and strengthen the unity of technicians and workers. Therefore, the Hegang Mining Bureau decided to promote it to all mines and faces. Li Leting was also recognized by the entire mine as the flag bearer for promoting mechanized coal mining.

    Note:

    (1) The high fall style is one of the coal mining methods. Eating high falls is the colloquial term for the high fall style.

    (2) Drilling is the first step in blasting coal with gunpowder.

    (3) Nesting work refers to being at work with no work to do, wasting labor.

　　推广机械化采煤的李乐亭
    林里
    在东北鹤岗煤矿上，只要提起李乐亭，谁都知道这是一位“吃高落”（注一）的能手。一九四八年底，他以优越的打眼（注二）技术，被评为该矿二等劳动模范。一九四九年开展新纪录运动，他掌子的产量提高了百分之二十五点七，并且没有发生死伤事故。因而他在安全生产与创新纪录方面立下两大功劳。但他更大的功绩还是在于推行机械化采煤。他曾以高度的组织才能和领导艺术，克服了部分职工不接受新式工具的落后思想，战胜了实行机械化采煤的初期混乱现象。他所创议的严密分工、统一合作的工作方法与掌子委员会的组织，推动了机械化的进度。现已普遍推广于鹤岗全矿各掌子。
  鹤岗要用机械代人工
    鹤岗煤矿解放以来，在采煤方法上跨跃了两大步。这里，原来和全国其他煤矿一样，是用着古老的“高落式”采煤。去年试行充填长壁方法获成功。使落后的煤矿生产前进了一步；今年五月开始实行机械化，出现了煤矿生产上的新局面。这就是用截煤机代替了人工掏槽，用风镐、电钻代替了手抡镢，用卡机、煤溜子代替了人力运输。机械化意味着生产方法的大革命，也就是从煤矿笨重落后的生产方法，走向解放体力劳动者的新道路。
  重重困难，阻碍机械化推行
    但是，这个大改变就遇着很多新的困难。比如说：机器来了不会用；学会用了不会修理。风镐电钻虽然好，但一时操作不习惯，各种工作配合不协调；机械化开始停闭了许多小掌子，干部工人都要从新配备，初到新掌子的人们人生地不熟，下坑后掘进工找不到地点，回采工不知道去向等等，一时形成忙闲不均和大量“窠工”（注三）。并由此影响到产量降低，工资减少，成本增高。有些工人发怨言，甚而个别领导干部怀疑机械化的效果。
  李乐亭动脑筋克服困难
    这时，李乐亭在兴山矿一○三大掌子工作，当初他也感到截煤机下坑后响得厉害，没有吃高落时每人一根镐镢来得痛快。然而这位以抡镐镢驰名的“吃高落”能手，没有跟在群众屁股后头乱嚷嚷，他开始由体力劳动转而为动脑筋。他回忆当年由高落式改变为充填长壁式时的情景。那时，同样遭遇到若干人的反对，李乐亭自己就亲自向矿长提意说：“充填长壁不会成功。吃高落多好呢，一炮能下好几百吨煤？”那时矿长曾用“采煤必须护矿”的道理说服了他，并在以后实事中，证明了充填长壁既安全，又能提高回收率。从此李乐亭成了推广充填长壁的积极分子。他回顾人民政府接受鹤岗煤矿以来的历次改革，并从而得出结论说：“改革一定对工人有利。上级不会‘坑’咱。”从这个简单朴素的真理出发，李乐亭把各种机械做了细心的观察、比较，他肯定了机械化无论如何比人工的效率高。机器刨煤工人多省劲啊？！现在的问题，就在于我们还没有掌握了机器。
    他把他自己的想法和看法到处和与山矿的工人谈，也就稳定了职工情绪。
  高度的组织性与明确分工
    然而实行机械化后的整个情况是复杂的，不像“吃高落”抡镢把的时代，只要打通了群众思想，并坚定了群众信心，再有个积极分子带头就干开了。而现在所需要的，是要大家掌握机器和技术，是需要用坚强的组织才能把群众引导到正确途径。
    李乐亭这时就找有经验的工人商议，找技术人员研究，找各小组、各小班的积极分子讨论加强组织性的办法，终于发现了阻碍工作进行的原因首先是没有严密的分工。人们在机械化面前，还像抡镐把时一样：打眼累了去刨煤，刨煤不愿干了去支柱，有时候推车的也去抡镐头……这种漫无秩序的现象造成“窠工”浪费与忙闲不均。从此他提议改变劳动组织，进行严格分工。具体办法是把机械、采煤、充填、运输等分为四组，各负专责，互不影响。并按着劳动过程排列各组的工作时间和任务。这就克服了盲无头绪的混乱现象，并具体贯彻了工具使用与管理的专责制。行政上批准了他的建议，一○三掌子的效率很快由一点九吨，上升为二点九吨。
  统一领导
    李乐亭并进一步改革了管理制度。原来这里的三班制作业，是班与班之间互不联系。过去就存在着各班只顾自己多出煤，不顾下班困难的现象。在实行机械化时，这种各自为政的局面阻碍着工作进行，影响了工程规格与安全。李乐亭提议：打破过去单以时间划分的管理方法，每三班组成一个中心组，选举正副组长，掌握三班生产计划与生产进度。这样既可促进职工团结，加强整体观念，又可严格工程规格与健全交接班制度。
  组织学习
    在解决严格分工与合作统一的复杂问题同时，他组织人们学习技术。把具有文化水平的青年工人，有计划的分配到截煤机组，实行一个徒弟，跟一个师傅的跟班制，因而很快掌握了技术，克服了“机器不听人使唤”的困难。截煤机手的前进速度，也就逐渐由每小时的十米增至三十五米。促使直接工的采煤效率由三点○三吨，上升为七点五五吨。更重要的是使人们看到了机械的功能，坚定了全面开展机械化的信心。
  成立掌子委员会
    由于李乐亭的努力，一○三大掌子的机械化运动，跑到了各个机械化掌子的前面。日产量在一个月的时间内就从二百吨上升到三百九十九吨。李乐亭认为他所以能够想出种种改进办法，是由于他和群众的广泛联系。所以随着机械化的开展，他就把原来那种不定形的征求职工意见的会议组成掌子委员会，除吸收各班小组长外，并由工人中选举若干委员，开会期间中心组长为当然主席，邀请坑长、技术人员出席指导。会议每周一次，处理当前所急需解决的问题。此外就是检查生产计划的执行，检查产品质量、工程规格、安全设备，与领导技术研究等。这个掌子委员会，实质上就是小型的民主管理委员会。一○三大掌子实行的结果，是密切了领导与群众的联系，加强了技术人员和工人的团结。因此，鹤岗矿务局决定把它推广到各矿各掌子。李乐亭也同时被全矿公认为是推广机械化采煤的旗手。
    注：
    （一）高落式是采煤方法之一种。吃高落就是用高落式的俗称。
    （二）打眼是用火药崩煤时的第一步工程。
    （三）窠工是指上了班无工可做，浪费工的意思。
