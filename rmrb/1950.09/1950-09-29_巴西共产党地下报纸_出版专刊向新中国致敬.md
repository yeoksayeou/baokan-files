　　Brazilian Communist Party Underground Newspaper
    Publishes Special Issue Paying Tribute to New China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 28th] The Brazilian Communist Party's organ, "Voice of Labor," published underground, released a special issue on the People's Republic of China on June 24th, and published an editorial entitled "The Road of China" as well as several articles about China by Chairman Mao Zedong, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, and other Chinese leaders, as well as Soviet and Brazilian writers. The newspaper's editorial pointed out: "The Chinese people have shaken off years of feudal and colonial oppression and are forever liberated. Their historic victory is the most earth-shattering event of the contemporary era since the great October Socialist Revolution in the Soviet Union. This victory not only broke the strong chains of imperialism, enabling one of the world's largest countries with a population of nearly 500 million to stand up, but it is also a powerful revolutionary factor and a strong encouragement to all oppressed peoples in carrying out national liberation struggles." The editorial also pointed out: "The victory of the Chinese people points out the road for us. We in Brazil must also follow this direction and strive to liberate our people from the shackles of the American imperialists and their running dogs."
    The first page of the newspaper had a large headline that read: "Salute to New China, revolutionary forces around the world unite and fight against imperialism."

    【新华社布拉格二十八日电】在地下出版的巴西共产党机关报《工人之声》，六月二十四日出版中华人民共和国专刊，并发表了一篇题为“中国的道路”的专论及数篇毛泽东主席、朱德总司令及其他中国领袖和苏联及巴西作家所著关于中国的文章。该报专论指出：“中国人民已挣脱了多年的封建和殖民地压迫，永远解放了，他们的历史性胜利，是从苏联伟大的十月社会主义革命以来当代最为翻天复地的事件。这胜利不仅挣断了坚牢的帝国主义锁链，使人口几及五万万的世界最大国家之一站立了起来，而且更是一个有力的革命因素，是对一切被压迫的各族人民开展民族解放斗争的有力鼓舞。”专论并指出：“中国人民的胜利给我们指出了道路，我们巴西也必须遵循这方向，争取从美帝国主义者及其走狗的枷锁下解放我们的人民。”
