　　Lang Jiehua, the People's Female Teacher
　　 Zheng Yi
　　Comrade Lang Jiehua, who was recently honorably elected as the Vice Chairman of the National Committee at the First National Congress of the Educational Workers' Union, is a famous model female teacher in the Tangshan Prefecture of Hebei Province. Her glorious deeds of "transforming a backward mountain village into a model village" through years of arduous efforts have been widely circulated in the vast rural areas of Tangshan Prefecture.

　　I. Laboriously Organizing Children to Attend School in a Poor Mountain Village

　　Comrade Lang Jiehua is twenty-seven years old this year. She grew up in a poor citizen's family in Beijing. After graduating from middle school, she was forced by family difficulties to go to the countryside with her father, who was over fifty years old, and began to engage in elementary education in Lulong County, Hebei Province. In the spring of 1947, she was sent to teach in Xiazhuang, District Three. The village was a poor small mountain village close to the foot of the Great Wall, with only seventy-five households. During the Anti-Japanese War, the school's buildings and equipment were burned and ravaged by the Japanese and puppet troops, and the school was forced to close. So when she first arrived in the village, the school was desolate, and it was clearly very difficult to start school. However, she was not discouraged by this. She actively contacted village cadres, collected desks and chairs, repaired classrooms, and mobilized for school, barely gathering twenty students (less than one-third of the village's school-age children). Then she patiently conducted home visits, deeply understanding the children's difficulties in attending school and the parents' requirements. Thirteen poor girls, under her enthusiastic mobilization, moved their spinning wheels to the school, spinning thread while studying. After ten days of persuasion and mobilization, the number of students gradually increased from twenty to forty-two. But there were still some poor children grazing cattle. She then began to mobilize seven children who were grazing cattle, organized a reading group, and used the summer lunch break time to slowly teach them to read. After four months of study, the seven children who were grazing cattle could all write more than two hundred Chinese characters.

　　In order to encourage children to study hard, she often launched competitions between groups and classes. She cordially mingled with the children every day, deeply understanding each child's personality and psychology, adopting various different methods for enlightenment and guidance, and seizing the students' strengths and weaknesses, giving criticism or praise on the blackboard newspaper at any time, constantly encouraging the students' interest in reading. In daily life, she enthusiastically educated the students to be diligent and hygienic, so that every student developed good habits such as automatically padding the pigsty and cleaning the yard when they returned home from school every day, which was universally supported by the parents, thus gradually consolidating the students' learning mood.

　　II. Rather Not Earn Teaching Salary, Than Let Children Drop Out of School

　　In the autumn of 1948, hailstorms were common along the Great Wall, and crops were poor, making the lives of the people in Xiazhuang even more difficult. In the spring of 1949, because the masses were really unable to afford school funding, the village cadres advocated closing the school. Lang Jiehua, concerned about the pain of the children dropping out of school, told the village cadres that she was willing not to earn a teaching salary and insisted on starting school, relying on the teaching income of her elderly father to maintain the lives of the mother and daughter. Unfortunately, her father died of illness at this time, losing the source of living expenses. She then sold her remaining clothes, and her mother went to the mountains to dig wild vegetables to maintain their lives. In the difficult days of eating two meals of vegetable porridge a day, she always insisted on teaching without懈怠，坚持了六个月。

　　In order to lead the students to help their families produce and survive the famine, she led the students to chop firewood on the mountain every day after class. The firewood chopped by the students was sent to the students' homes, and the firewood she chopped was kept in the school. One day she discovered that white clay was produced on the hillside, so she carefully studied it, filtered the white clay into fine powder with a cloth, mixed it with rice soup, and made chalk with iron tubes. Not only was the quality white, but it was also strong and durable. In addition to supplying the school, she also led the students to produce chalk and sell it throughout the district. In half a year, she sold more than 560 kilograms of millet. In addition to solving the students' textbook and stationery expenses, when the autumn vacation came, she distributed the earned millet to the students according to the amount of labor each student contributed. The students' parents were extremely excited and said, "After studying, we can read and write, and we also earned millet. Teacher Lang is really good!"

　　Because Comrade Lang Jiehua taught seriously, the students' grades were very good. Last summer, when the district held a primary school student's general examination, the second and fourth-grade elementary school students in Xiazhuang took the first place in the district, and the third grade took the second place, which was praised and supported by the masses in the district. The masses in Liujiakou Village, a neighboring village, personally sent their thirty-two children to Xiazhuang to study with Teacher Lang. The number of students suddenly increased to eighty, and she was so tired that she coughed up blood, but she still insisted on teaching.

　　III. Under the Education and Influence of Lang Jiehua, the Backward Mountain Village Became a Model Village

　　After the local land reform in the winter of 1947, the emancipated peasant women improved their political consciousness and felt the pain of illiteracy. She actively led twenty-one women to organize literacy classes, which lasted for two years, so that most women learned more than four hundred characters. With the patient help of Teacher Lang and their own active efforts, three women, Li Surong, Qin Aiju, and Chen Sulan, have learned to write simple letters.

　　Last spring, when the government called for planting peanuts by soaking seeds, the masses had concerns. She actively publicized and explained, cleared the masses' thinking, and made everyone soak seeds to plant peanuts. She also used Sundays to personally help military families rush to plant. Some village cadres were not active in their work, so she often stayed up all night to help village cadres work, which had a great impact on the village cadres. When the government called for planting wheat, the village arranged to investigate each household's wheat planting plan and the total area that could be planted in the village. The village cadres wanted to use an estimated number to perfunctorily complete the task. She immediately spent two lunch breaks without rest, personally going to each household to understand, which moved the village cadres, so they cooperated with her and investigated together. Under her repeated model actions, the village cadres' enthusiasm for work gradually increased. In each central task, they all started together and completed the task ahead of schedule, turning the backward mountain village into a model village and repeatedly receiving commendations from the district government.

　　IV. Honorably Elected as Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Education Union, Becoming a Banner for Educational Workers to Advance

　　Female teacher Lang Jiehua, because of her such a high degree of enthusiasm for serving the people and consistently sharing weal and woe with the masses, is warmly loved by the masses. When she was ill, the people in the village constantly visited and comforted her, just like their own relatives. Last spring, when the news that the district wanted to transfer her away reached Xiazhuang, all the adults and children in the village were reluctant to part with her and resolutely asked the district government to keep her.

　　Last "June 6th" Teachers' Day, at the Lulong County Model Teachers Election Conference, she was elected as the county's first-class model teacher. At her urgent request, on June 8 last year, the Lulong County Committee of the Communist Party of China approved her to join the Communist Party. After returning to the village, she wrote a challenge letter to her husband (who was mobilized by her to join the army in 1946) in the Fourth Field Army with a fervent mood, encouraging her husband at the front to work hard to kill the enemy and make meritorious deeds, and a revolutionary competition unfolded between the husband and wife. In August, she represented Lulong County in the Tangshan Prefecture Model Teachers Election Conference. At the conference where one hundred and twenty-five people participated in the voting election, she was honorably elected as the first model teacher in the entire prefecture with one hundred and twenty-five votes (at that time, the meeting stipulated that she also had the right to vote for herself). So her name, along with the return of model teachers from various counties to the village, quickly spread throughout every village in the entire prefecture, becoming a glorious banner guiding the more than 9,000 primary school teachers in the entire district to advance.

　　This spring, she was transferred to Changli County Middle School as a teaching director and received the direct training of the prefectural party and government, actively mobilizing all teachers and students in the school, organizing clubs, and greatly enlivening the learning life of all teachers and students in the school.

　　Recently, as a representative of primary school teachers in Hebei Province, she was invited to attend the First National Congress of the National Education Union and was honorably elected as the Vice Chairman of the National Committee at the meeting. After the news of her victorious return spread, it caused a sensation in the education community of Tangshan Prefecture and in various primary and secondary schools in Changli City. Before going to Beijing to take office, when I visited her, she said to me cordially with excitement and joy: "Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, I, a primary school teacher from a poor background, could not imagine having today's liberation and glory. I deeply thank the Party and the government for their training. After I go to Beijing to take office this time, I will definitely live up to the hopes of the Party, the government, and the people, and serve the people's education cause wholeheartedly."

　　人民的女教师郎洁华
    郑毅
    最近在全国教育工会第一次代表大会上光荣当选为全国委员会副主席的郎洁华同志，是河北省唐山专区的著名模范女教师。她几年来艰苦努力，“变落后山庄为模范村”的光辉事迹，在唐山专区的广大农村中广泛流传。
    一、在贫困的小山庄苦心组织儿童上学
    郎洁华同志今年二十七岁，过去生长在北京市的一个贫苦市民家里。中学毕业后，被家庭困难所迫，便随着五十多岁的父亲到了乡间，开始在河北省卢龙县从事小学教育事业。一九四七年的春天，她被派到三区的下庄教书。该村是紧靠着长城脚下的一个贫穷的小山庄，全村仅七十五户人家。还在抗战期间，学校的校舍和设备，被日、满军烧毁和糟蹋光了，学校被迫停顿。所以当她刚到该村的时候，学校一片荒凉，开学显然是非常困难的。但她并没有因此灰心，积极联系村干部，收集桌椅，修理教室，动员开学，勉强凑集了二十个学生（不到全村学龄儿童的三分之一）。接着她即耐心的进行了家庭访问，深入了解儿童们的上学困难和家长的要求。十三个贫苦的女儿童，在她的热情动员下，把纺车搬到学校里，一边纺线一边念书。经过十天的说服动员，学生逐渐由二十名增加到四十二名了。但还有些贫苦的儿童在放牛。她便着手动员了七个放牛的儿童，组织了一个读书小组，利用夏季歇晌时间，慢慢教他们认字，经四个月的学习，七个放牛的儿童都会写二百多个生字。
    为了鼓励儿童努力读书，她经常发动学生进行组与组、班与班的竞赛。每天和儿童们亲热的打成一片，深入了解每个儿童的个性与心理，采取各种不同的方法，进行启发和辅导，并抓住学生的优缺点，随时在黑板报上给以批评或表扬，不断鼓舞着学生们的读书兴趣。在日常生活中，她热情的教育学生要勤劳、讲卫生，使每个学生每天放学回家时，都养成了自动的垫猪圈打扫院子等优良习惯，受到了家长们的普遍拥护，从而日渐巩固了学生们的学习情绪。
    二、宁肯不赚教薪，不让儿童失学
    一九四八年秋，长城沿线普遍遭受雹灾，庄稼歉收，下庄老百姓的生活更加困难了。一九四九年春季，因群众实在无力负担学校经费，村干部们都主张关闭学校。郎洁华关心着儿童们失学的痛苦，便告诉村干部，她情愿不赚教薪，坚持开学，靠着年老的父亲教书收入，来维持母女的生活。不幸父亲却在这个时候一病死去，失掉了生活费的来源。她于是出卖自己剩余的衣服，母亲上山挖野菜借以维持生活。在一天吃两顿菜粥的艰苦日子里，她始终不懈地坚持着教学，这样坚持了六个月。
    她为了领导学生帮助家里生产度荒，每天课余，率领学生一齐上山打柴。学生打的送到学生家里，自己打的留在学校。一天她发现了山腰上产白土子，就精心研究，把白土子用包袱滤成细末，用米汤粘合，用铁筒制成粉笔，不但质地洁白，而且坚韧耐用。除供给学校用外，还领导学生进行粉笔生产，推销到全区，半年中卖得小米五百六十多斤，除解决了学生们书籍文具的费用外，放秋假时，还按每个学生出劳动力多少，将赚得的小米分给了学生。学生们的家长都异常兴奋地说：“念了书，识了字，还挣了小米子，郎老师可真好啊！”
    因为郎洁华同志认真教学，学生成绩都很好。去年夏季，区里举行初小学生会考时，下庄的二、四年级小学生考取了全区的第一名，三年级考了第二名，受到了全区群众的赞扬和拥护。邻村刘家口村群众亲自把自己的三十二个儿童，也送到下庄来跟郎老师念书，学生骤然增加到八十名，累得她吐了血，但她仍然坚持着教学。
    三、在郎洁华的教育、影响下落后的山庄变成了模范村
    一九四七年冬季当地进行土地改革后，翻身农妇提高了政治觉悟，感到不识字的痛苦，她就积极领导二十一个妇女组织了识字班，一直坚持了二年，使一般妇女都学会了四百多字。妇女李素荣、秦爱菊和陈素兰三个人，在郎老师的耐心帮助和他们自己的积极努力下，已经学会写简单的书信了。
    去年春季，政府号召用浸种方法种花生，群众有顾虑，她便积极宣传解释，打通了群众思想，使大家都浸种种花生。她还利用星期日，亲自下手帮助军属抢种。有的村干部工作不积极，她就经常整夜不休息的帮助村干部工作，给村干部们很大的影响。在政府号召种麦时，村里布置调查每户种麦计划和全村可能播种的面积。村干部们想用估计个数字敷衍了事。她即自动地在两个晌午不休息，亲自到各户去了解，使村干部们受了感动，便和她配合起来，一齐调查。在她屡次的模范行动影响下，村干部们的工作热情也日渐增高，在每个中心工作中，都是一齐下手，提前完成任务，使落后的山庄，一变而为模范村，屡次受到区政府的表扬。
    四、光荣当选教育工会全国委员会副主席成为教育工作者前进的旗帜女教师郎洁华，因为具有这样高度为人民服务的热情，一贯与群众同甘共苦，所以受到群众的热烈爱戴。她病了，村里的人们都像对自己的亲人一样，不断的去看望和慰问。去年春天区里曾想把她调走的消息传到了下庄，全村大人小孩对她难分难舍，坚决向区政府要求，挽留下来。
    去年“六六”教师节，在卢龙全县模范教师选举大会上，她当选为全县的甲等模范教师。在她的迫切要求下，于去年六月八日，中共卢龙县委批准她参加共产党。回村后，她便以狂热的心情，给她在四野的丈夫（一九四六年经她动员参军的）写了一封挑战书，鼓励她前线的丈夫努力杀敌立功，夫妻间展开了革命竞赛。八月间，她代表卢龙县参加了唐山专区模范教师竞选大会，在一百二十五个人参加投票选举的大会上，她以一百二十五票（当时会议规定自己也有投票选自己的权利）光荣当选为全专区第一名模范教师。于是她的名字，便随着各县模范教师的回村，迅速的传遍了全专区的每个村庄，成了引导全区九千多位小学教师前进的光辉旗帜。
    今年春天，她被调到昌黎县立中学任教导干事，更得到了专区党和政府的直接培养，积极发动全校师生，组织了俱乐部，大大的活跃了全校师生的学习生活。
    最近她作为河北省小学教师的代表，被邀出席了全国教育工会第一次代表大会，在会上又光荣的当选为全国委员会的副主席，胜利归来的消息传开后，轰动了唐山专区的教育界和昌黎城各个中小学校。在赴京就职前，我去访问她时，她以兴奋和愉快的心情，亲切地对我说：“没有中国共产党的领导，我这贫苦出身的小学教员，就不能想像会有今天的解放和光荣。我深深感谢党和政府对我的培养。我这次到北京就职后，一定不辜负党和政府以及人民的希望，全心全意为人民的教育事业服务。”
