Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 5th—The people of Wulongbei District, Andong City, held a rally at 3 p.m. on the 3rd to protest the atrocities of U.S. aircraft and mourn the martyred heroes. More than 1,600 representatives of workers, peasants, and students from the district participated in the rally. Chen Beichen, Mayor of Andong City People's Government, and Li Cheng, Deputy Secretary of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, also attended.

　　In the incident on the 27th of last month when U.S. aircraft strafed Andong Airport, residents Wang Guanzhong and Sun Zilin were brutally murdered; Dong Chengde, Tang Guishan, Li Rongfa, Zhang Desheng, Wu Longchen, Fu Yongjun, and Fang Shirong (originally from Dalian City, now residing in Wulongbei Village) were injured.

　　A week after their sons were killed and injured by the U.S. Air Force, the people of Wulongbei District, with immense grief and indignation, denounced the atrocities of the U.S. aircraft in slaughtering the Chinese people at the meeting and expressed their deep condolences to the martyred heroes.

　　The mothers of the martyred Wang Guanzhong and Sun Zilin sat on the right side of the altar with their families. The altar was filled with elegiac couplets, mourning curtains, and wreaths from more than fifty units representing all levels of the Party, government, military, and people of Liaodong Province, Andong City, and Wulongbei District, with portraits of the two martyrs, Wang and Sun, hanging in the center.

　　After the public memorial ceremony, Wang Guanxiang, the eldest brother of martyr Wang Guanzhong, and Sun Shuying, the second elder sister of Sun Zilin, stepped onto the stage to denounce the crimes.

　　Wang Guanxiang and Sun Shuying are both workers at the No. 1 Silk Weaving Factory in Liaodong Province and the Wulongbei Village Fur Factory. Wang Guanxiang is also a member of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. In his denunciation, he said: "American planes killed my brother, I hate them to death, I want to avenge this blood debt!" He also said: "My brother was also a Youth League member before his death. He sacrificed gloriously for all of us to live a good life. We must learn from him!"

　　Sun Shuying denounced: "The American devils don't want the Chinese people to live a good life, we must resolutely oppose them to the end! We must step up production in the rear, strive to become production models, and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to defeat the American devils' aggression and avenge my brother."

　　Fang Shirong, a worker who was injured in the left leg by the U.S. Air Force, also personally attended the meeting to denounce the crimes. As soon as he stepped onto the stage, he cursed: "American planes strafing our Chinese people is outrageous. They injured my leg, I must break their legs!"

　　When the victims' families and the injured denounced the crimes, the crowd repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Avenge the blood debt and avenge the martyred compatriots!" "Resolutely defeat the aggression of U.S. imperialism!"

　　Chen Beichen, Mayor of Andong City People's Government, Li Cheng, Deputy Secretary of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Gao Laibin, Village Chief of Wulongbei Village, and twelve others delivered protest speeches at the meeting. The meeting finally passed a cable of denunciation to the United Nations Security Council.

　　The cable said: We have seen with our own eyes the corpses brutally killed by U.S. aircraft, and we have heard with our own ears the cries of the families of the deceased. Everyone gritted their teeth and beat their chests. Our anger is difficult to contain. We must avenge this blood debt. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the U.S. government, demanding that the United Nations Security Council immediately take effective measures to quickly punish the U.S. imperialists for their crimes of invading Chinese airspace and killing the Chinese people, and demanding that the U.S. imperialists withdraw their invading troops from Korea in order to maintain peace in the Far East and world peace. The cable finally firmly stated that all the people in the district must unite and take practical actions to intensify production, work hard, and study actively, to prepare to avenge the dead and redress the grievances of the wounded.

　　安东五龙背区人民集会
    沉痛追悼死难烈士
    坚决表示要向美帝讨还血债
    【新华社安东五日电】安东市五龙背区人民于三日下午三时，举行抗议美机暴行暨追悼死难烈士大会。参加这次大会的有该区工人、农民、学生代表共一千六百余人。安东市人民政府市长陈北辰、中共安东市委副书记李澄等负责人均前往参加。
    在上月二十七日美机扫射安东机场的事件中，该区居民王管忠、孙子林二人惨遭屠杀；董成德、唐桂山、李荣发、张德生、吴隆臣、傅永俊、房世荣（原籍大连市人，现居五龙背村）等七人被杀伤。
    五龙背区人民在他们的子弟被美国空军杀伤后的一个星期，怀着极大的悲愤，在会上控诉了美机残杀中国人民的暴行，并向死难烈士致深切的哀悼。
    死难烈士王管忠和孙子林的母亲都带着全家人坐在祭坛前右侧。祭坛上布满了辽东省、安东市和五龙背区各级党、政、军、民各界共五十多个单位送来的挽联，挽帐及花圈，中悬王、孙二烈士的遗像。
    公祭仪式举行后，烈士家属王管忠的长兄王管祥和孙子林的二姊孙淑英接着登坛控诉。
    王管祥和孙淑英都是辽东省营柞丝第一纺织厂五龙背村毛皮厂的工人，王管祥并是中国新民主主义青年团团员。他在控诉中说：“美国飞机杀死了我的兄弟，我恨死了他们，我要讨还这笔血账！”他又说：“我的兄弟生前也是一个青年团员，他为了我们大伙儿过好日子光荣牺牲了，我们要好好地向他学习！”
    孙淑英控诉说：“美国鬼子不让我们中国人民过好日子，我们要坚决反对到底！我们要在后方加紧生产，争取当生产模范，配合人民解放军，打垮美国鬼子的侵略，替我的兄弟报仇。”
    被美国空军打伤了左腿的工人房世荣，也亲自到会上控诉。他一走上台就痛骂说：“美国飞机扫射咱中国人，太岂有此理了。他打伤了我的腿，我一定要打断他的腿！”
    当受难者家属及受伤者控诉时，台下不断的高呼：“讨还血债，替死难同胞报仇！”“坚决打垮美帝国主义的侵略！”等口号。
    安东市人民政府市长陈北辰，中共安东市委副书记李澄，五龙背村村长高来宾等十二人都在会上相继发表了抗议的演说。大会最后通过了给联合国安全理事会的控诉电文。
    电文中说：我们亲眼看见被美机惨杀的尸体，亲耳听到死难者家属的悲哭声，人人切齿，个个捶胸，我们的愤怒是难以遏制的。我们一定要讨还这笔血债，我们坚决拥护周外长对美国政府的严重抗议，要求联合国安全理事会立即采取有效措施，迅速制裁美帝国主义侵入中国领空残杀中国人民的罪行，要求美帝国主义撤退在朝鲜的侵略军队，以维护远东和平与世界和平。电文最后坚决表示该区全体人民要团结起来以加紧生产、努力工作、积极学习的实际行动，准备为死者报仇，为伤者雪恨。
