　　The North China Film Management Company of the Film Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture, following the instructions of higher authorities, convened a symposium of film industry representatives from the North China region from September 5th to 7th, in order to further improve the relationship between public and private sectors, listen to the opinions of the masses, and review its own work. More than 50 representatives of cinemas and film manufacturers from Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan and other places attended the meeting. During the meeting, more than 90 opinions were put forward by all parties and discussed and studied in a harmonious atmosphere. They unanimously expressed their warm support for striving for the advantage of progressive films and unifying film scheduling policies. The meeting also summarized the work in the first half of 1950. Due to the implementation of the unified film scheduling policy and the efforts of comrades working in cinemas in various places, state-owned films, Soviet films, and progressive films from private companies occupied an absolute advantage in the market, attracting a total of more than 12 million viewers, thus resisting American films and some unhealthy films in China, and solving the difficulty of cinemas finding films on their own, and strengthening the unity among cinemas. At the same time, the meeting reviewed the shortcomings of the work of the company's subordinate units, and criticized and self-criticized the bad work styles and attitudes of some staff members, in order to better grasp the policies and improve the film distribution work in North China on the existing basis in the future.
