Wang Daqiu, the special-class model worker in guiding the Yi River, who is well-known in northern Jiangsu, was originally named Wang Zhaoshan. He is from Shuanghe Township, Zhangji District, Shuyang County, northern Jiangsu. From childhood, he farmed rented land and worked as a hired hand, eating grass roots and suffering from hunger. In 1939, his father died of illness, and the twelve mu of land he rented was also seized by the landlord. It was not until the land reform in 1946 that he was allocated eighteen mu of land. Seven or eight mu of his eighteen mu of land were often plagued by floods; however, he had an idea: "The Communist Party and the People's Government will one day lead us to overcome floods and grow good crops."

In the spring of 1949, Shuyang County repaired the Chai Mi River embankment. He was extremely happy to hear about the embankment repair for flood prevention. He brought an exceptionally large hoe, and each hoe of mud weighed twenty or thirty jin. Everyone called him "Wang Daqiu" (Big Hoe Wang). After the embankment repair was completed, his team was rated as a "First-Class Model" in the county, and Wang Daqiu was rated as a "First-Class Model Laborer." Wang Daqiu's name spread. During this water management project, due to his active efforts, he gloriously joined the Communist Party.

In the winter of the same year, the Yi River Guiding Project began. He led a team of thirteen laborers and made a new, large hoe. After recounting the suffering from floods, the entire team realized that water management was their own major concern. They wrote a letter of determination, made a plan to earn merits, and challenged Feng Dianzhen, a production model in the county.

On the second day of work, just as dawn broke, shivering from the cold, he took the lead and started working. In the evening, he calculated carefully with the team, saying that pushing one more cart of mud would earn three liang of grain, encouraging everyone to "work more, get more grain, and go home to survive the disaster." At the same time, he taught the team how to dig mud blocks, often using the slogans "Digging the river prevents flooding, digging the river survives the disaster, digging the river is for ourselves" to educate the team. Therefore, their project surpassed others in two or three days. The laborers from all nine teams in the township said, "Are they (referring to Wang Daqiu's team) human and we are not?" They unanimously proposed, "Follow Wang Daqiu!" In a few days, at the district's laborers' meeting, thirty labor teams made a plan to "catch up with Wang Daqiu."

During the competition, everyone followed Wang Daqiu's team's example. More than one hundred and twenty teams in the district were swept into the competition frenzy. After estimating the volume five days later, the results showed that the average laborer in the district dug 2.9 cubic meters of earth per day, while Wang Daqiu's team dug 5.5 cubic meters of earth.

In order to promote the rapid progress of the entire project, the Yi River Guiding Headquarters and Political Department, while deploying the merit-earning competition movement for 250,000 laborers, called for "discovering and cultivating thousands of Wang Daqiu-style model laborer banners!" and introduced the reasons for the increased engineering efficiency of Wang Daqiu's team at the meeting.

Wang Daqiu usually cared for the laborers very much, taking care of them very thoughtfully. Because the weather was cold, Zhang Yongfu was still wearing thin clothes and had no quilt to cover himself at night, so everyone let him sleep in the warm middle. Xue He was weak, so Wang Daqiu let him sleep inside, and he slept outside. Every time Wang Daqiu woke up at night, he would always check if the clothes of the people next to him had fallen off. One night, he helped Zhang Yongfu and Xue He cover themselves twice. Xue He said, "Wang Daqiu is even better than my own brother."

During work, they achieved "getting up fast in the morning, pushing the cart with quick legs, and digging the mud with a fast hoe." At the highest speed, each person could dig more than seven cubic meters of earth in a day. At the laborers' representative meeting of more than a thousand people from ten counties, the representatives from each county, after hearing about Wang Daqiu's glorious deeds, unanimously proposed to "compete with Wang Daqiu, learn from Wang Daqiu!" From then on, the labor competition of 250,000 laborers was launched vigorously. New model figures such as "Zhao Da?" and "Wang Dakang" in Shuyang, "Wang Shifang" in PiSui (newly established county), and "Dong Datiao" in Suqian emerged along with the competition, promoting the rapid progress of the entire project. Wang Daqiu's labor team completed the project at an astonishing speed of twenty-six days. At the celebration meeting of more than 1,200 people, Wang Daqiu won a huge silk banner. This time he was elected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

### 导沂特等功臣王大鍬

　　导沂特等功臣王大鍬
    闻名苏北的导沂特等功臣王大鍬，原名王兆山，苏北沭阳县章集区双河乡人。他从小就种租田，做雇工，吃过草根，挨过饿。一九三九年父亲病死，租种的十二亩地也被地主夺去，直到一九四六年土地改革时，他才分得了十八亩土地。他的十八亩地中，有七、八亩地常遭水患；但是他有一个想法：“共产党、人民政府总有一天会领导我们战胜水灾，种好庄稼的。”
    一九四九年春天，沭阳县修整柴米河堤。他听说修堤防水，高兴极了，带的鍬特别大，挖一鍬泥块总有二、三十斤重，大家就叫他“王大鍬”。修堤结束了，他的小组被评为全县“一等模范”，王大鍬被评为“一等模范民工”。王大鍬的名字就传开了。在这次治水中，由于他积极努力，光荣地参加了共产党。
    当年冬天，导沂工程开始了，他又带领了十三个人的民工班上工，新打了一把大鍬。经过了诉水苦，全班人认识了治水是自己的大事，就写了决心书，订下立功计划，并向全县的生产模范冯殿珍提出挑战。
    在开工的第二天，天刚发亮，寒冷得使人发抖，他就带头上了工。晚上睡下来，又和班里人算细账，用多推一车泥，就要多得三两粮，鼓励大家“多做工多得粮回家度灾荒”。同时，他又教班里人学会挖泥块子，常以“扒河不受淹、扒河度灾荒、扒河为自己”的口号教育班里的人，因此他们的工程两三天后就超过了旁人。全乡九个班的民工都说：“他（指王大鍬班）是人我们不是人吗？”一致提出：“跟着王大鍬走！”不几天区里的民工大会上，就有三十个民工班订了计划——“追上王大鍬”。
    竞赛过程中大家都跟着王大鍬班看齐。全区一百二十多个班都卷入了竞赛热潮。在五天以后估方的结果是：全区民工平均每人每天挖二点九公方土，王大鍬班是五点五公方土。
    为了推动整个工程的迅速进行，导沂司令部、政治部在布置开展二十五万民工的立功竞赛运动时，号召“要发现、培养出千万个王大鍬式的民工旗帜来！”并在会上介绍了王大鍬班工程效力提高的原因。
    王大鍬平常对民工都很关心，照顾的十分周到。因为天气冷，张永富还穿的单衣，夜里没被子盖，大家就让他睡在中间温暖的地方，薛鹤的身体瘦弱，王大鍬让他睡在里面，自己睡在外边。夜里王大鍬每次醒来总要摸摸旁人的衣服有没有翻掉，有一夜接连帮张永富、薛鹤盖了两次衣裳。薛鹤说：“王大鍬比嫡亲的哥哥还好。”
    作工中，他们做到了“早上起身快，推车脚腿快，挖泥土鍬头快”，速度最高时，每人一天能挖七公方多土。在十个县千余人的民工代表大会上，各县代表听到王大鍬的光荣事迹后，都一致提出要向“王大鍬竞赛、看齐！”从此，二十五万民工的劳动竞赛，便轰轰烈烈的展开了。沭阳的“赵大?”、“王大筐”，邳睢（新设县）的“王十方”，宿迁的“董大挑”等新型的模范人物，便随着竞赛而涌现出来，推动着整个工程的迅速进行。王大鍬民工班以二十六天的惊人速度完工了。在一千二百多人的庆功大会上，王大鍬荣获巨幅锦旗。这次当选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议代表。
