　　To Meet People's Needs After Autumn Harvest
    East China Expands Processing Plan
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, August 31st】China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, East China Branch, has decided to expand the processing plan of state-owned and private yarn factories throughout the region starting in September, increasing the supply of cotton yarn to prepare for the large demand from the people in various regions after the autumn harvest. The large amount of raw cotton that the company has purchased and stored in recent months is sufficient to supply the processing needs until the new cotton comes on the market. According to the expanded processing plan, private factories in Shanghai will generally increase processing by two shifts per week (ten hours per shift), totaling ten shifts including the original eight shifts; state-owned factories will increase from ten shifts to twelve shifts; factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will generally increase processing by three shifts per week, totaling eleven shifts including the original eight shifts; state-owned factories in Jinan and Qingdao will also operate twelve shifts per week. The increase in the operating rate will appropriately reduce costs; however, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation will still pay processing fees according to the original standard, in order to allow private yarn factories to further strive for break-even and profit.

　　适应秋收后人民需要
    华东扩大代纺计划
    【新华社上海八月三十一日电】中国花纱布公司华东区公司决定自九月份起扩大全区公私营纱厂代纺计划，增加棉纱供应量，以备秋收后各地人民的大量需要。该公司近数月来所陆续购备的大量原棉，足够供应代纺所需直到新棉上市。根据扩大的代纺计划，上海私营厂每周将普遍增加代纺二班（每班十小时），连原开八班共十班；公营厂将由十班增至十二班；江苏、浙江地区各厂每周将普遍增加代纺三班，连同原开八班共计十一班；济南及青岛各公营厂每周也将开十二班。开工率的增加，将使成本适当降低；但是，花纱布公司仍按原定标准发付工缴费，以照顾各私营纱厂得以进一步争取保本和盈余。
