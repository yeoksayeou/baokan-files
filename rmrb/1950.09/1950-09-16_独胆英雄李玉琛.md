　　Lone Brave Hero Li Yucheng

　　Special Class Combat Hero Li Yucheng is a representative of a certain army of the People's Liberation Army attending the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference. His most outstanding battle of "planting the red flag on Gaotai Mountain" is a glorious epic in the Chinese People's Liberation War.
　　In the severe winter of 1947, Gaotai Mountain, the commanding height outside Zhangwu City in Liaoxi Province, Northeast China, was covered with a layer of snow. The enemy defended one pillbox after another, mutually supporting each other, with a battalion's main force. When a company of our main attacking force charged towards the northwest corner of Gaotai Mountain, they were suddenly intercepted by enemy machine gun fire from a bunker on the southeast slope. The entire company was exposed in the enemy's fire net. At this critical moment, Li Yucheng did not hesitate to venture with his squad leader through a deep ditch on the flank, rolling and crawling forward, rushing to the front of the chevaux-de-frise (obstacle fortification). He spared no effort to open a gap in the chevaux-de-frise, braving the enemy's rain of bullets to rush straight to the bunker position, stuffing a demolition tube into a bunker opening, instantly destroying the bunker. The victorious red flag fluttered on the bunker. Just as the entire company was about to charge upwards, the enemy's sub-bunkers organized a fire net again. In particular, an enemy main bunker in front, with a solid structure and two layers of loopholes, swept over with light and heavy weapons like a storm. Seeing the critical situation, Li Yucheng immediately rolled and crawled to the front of the large main bunker, stuffing two demolition tubes into the bunker opening. However, as soon as he lit the fuse, the enemy desperately pushed the demolition tubes outward, and they failed to explode three times in a row. Li Yucheng became anxious, thinking that if the mission was not completed, the entire company would inevitably suffer a severe blow from the enemy. So he tightly grasped the demolition tubes, desperately pushing them into the bunker opening. With a loud bang, the entire bunker collapsed, and he was also injured and fainted.
　　When he woke up, he saw that the large and small bunkers on Gaotai Mountain were still spewing out bursts of sparks, and rifle grenades exploded on the snow, raising bursts of white smoke, but several comrades from the entire company still charged up the mountain. Ignoring his injuries, he took a demolition tube from his comrade and charged towards a bunker in front, blowing it up. At this time, the enemies in the remaining bunkers were frightened by the brave charge and high demolition skills of the "Lone Brave Hero" Li Yucheng, and they did not dare to cower in the bunkers any longer, hurriedly scrambling to escape. Just as these forty or fifty enemies were about to launch a counter-attack and escape, Li Yucheng and his comrades, in the smoke of rifle grenades and hand grenades, picked up the hand grenades left by the enemy in the bunkers and threw them violently at the enemy, driving the enemy back into the碉堡 (diaobao - reinforced blockhouse/pillbox), making this 碉堡 (diaobao - reinforced blockhouse/pillbox) finally become the enemy's tomb.
　　At this time, the remaining enemy command post was still desperately resisting. Li Yucheng once again blasted through the barbed wire and seized the enemy's command post, planting the victorious "August 1st" red flag on the highest peak of Gaotai Mountain.
　　In the series of battles in Tongliao, Dahushan, Yikeshu, Shuangshanzi, and Jinzhou, Li Yucheng also demonstrated the great spirit of heroism and patriotism.
　　This year, he was transferred to a certain company of the "Liberation Camp" in the Pearl River Delta to work on the education and transformation of surrendered and captured Kuomintang troops. Under his patient education, the surrendered Kuomintang officers and soldiers made rapid progress. After the three-month study period, they all firmly demanded to join the People's Liberation Army.
　　Li Yucheng is a child who grew up in a poor peasant family. From the age of eleven, he worked for landlords, herding livestock. His childhood was spent under the oppression of the cruel feudal system. The Communist Party is here! Li Yucheng was given land and houses and no longer went hungry or cold. He watched the people's lives improve day by day after liberation, and saw the prospects for a rich and prosperous New China, deeply realizing the reasons for the past suffering, which made him determined to fight for the long-term interests of the broad masses of people and be a loyal soldier of the people.

　　独胆英雄李玉琛
    白英
    特等战斗英雄李玉琛是人民解放军某军出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的代表。他最出色的“把红旗插到高台山”的战斗，是中国人民解放战争中一页光辉的史诗。
    一九四七年严冬，东北辽西省彰武城外的制高点高台山已经铺满了一层莹白的雪衣。敌人用一个营的主力防守着一个个犄角相望的子母堡。当我军主攻部队一个连的兵力，向高台山西北角往上冲杀的时候，突被敌人在东南山坡地堡机枪的火力所阻截。全连已暴露在敌人的火网内。在这危急的关头，李玉琛毫不犹豫地同班长冒险从侧翼的深沟，连滚带爬地迂回向前，冲到鹿砦（障碍工事）前面，费尽了劲把鹿砦打开了缺口，冒着敌人的弹雨直冲地堡阵地，把爆破筒往一个地堡眼塞进去，只一下子就把这个地堡搞垮了。胜利的红旗飘扬在地堡上。全连正待向上冲杀，但敌人的子母堡又组织起火网，特别是前面一座构筑坚固、有两层枪眼的敌母堡，用轻重火器像狂风暴雨般扫射过来。李玉琛看见情势危急，立刻又连滚带爬的冲到大母堡跟前，把两根爆破筒塞进地堡眼。但是，他刚一拉火，敌人就死劲把爆破筒向外推，一连三次都没爆炸成功。李玉琛急了，暗想要是任务完不成，全连必然遭到敌人严重的打击。于是他紧紧握住爆破筒，死命地把它推到地堡的眼里去。一声巨响，整个地堡垮了下来，他也受伤昏倒。
    待他苏醒后，看见敌人在高台山的大小地堡还是喷射出一阵阵的火花，枪榴弹炸在雪地上腾起阵阵的白烟，但全连仍有几个同志冲上山来。他毫不理会自己的伤势，把战友的爆破筒拿过来，向前面的一个地堡冲去，把它爆倒了。这时，其余地堡的敌人，被“独胆英雄”李玉琛的勇猛冲杀和高度爆破技术吓得心胆交颤，不敢再在地堡里蜷伏，急急忙忙夺路奔逃。就在这四五十个敌人正要反冲锋突袭逃走的时候，李玉琛和他的战友又在枪榴弹与手榴弹的烟雾里，检起地堡里敌人所遗留的手榴弹向敌人猛烈投掷，把敌人赶回碉堡，使这座碉堡终于成为敌人的墓地。
    这时，剩下敌人的指挥所还在拼命顽抗。李玉琛又一次把铁丝网爆破，夺取了敌人的指挥所，把胜利的“八一”红旗插在高台山的最高峰。
    在通辽、打虎山、一棵树、双山子、锦州一连串的战役里，李玉琛也一样表现了英雄主义和爱国主义的伟大精神。
    今年，他被调到珠江三角洲某地“解放营”某连担任教育改造投降及被俘的国民党军队的工作。投降的国民党官兵在他耐心教育下进步很快，三个月学习期满后，他们都纷纷坚决要求参加人民解放军。
    李玉琛是一个生长在贫苦农民家庭的孩子，从十一岁起就替地主扛活（做工）、放牲口。他的少年时代是在残酷的封建制度压榨下挨过去的。共产党来了！李玉琛分到了地和房，再也不挨饿受冻了。他眼看着解放后人民生活一天天改善，看到丰饶富足的新中国的远景，深刻地认识到过去痛苦的原因，这使他决心为广大人民的长远利益而斗争，做一个人民忠诚的战士。
