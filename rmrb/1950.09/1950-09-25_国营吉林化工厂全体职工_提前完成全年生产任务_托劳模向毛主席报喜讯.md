　　All Employees of the State-Owned Jilin Chemical Plant
    Complete Annual Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule; Entrust Model Worker to Report Good News to Chairman Mao

    [Our Newspaper] Before Wang Yazhou, a model worker representative from the state-owned Jilin Chemical Plant, went to Beijing, all employees worked hard to complete the annual production tasks of quicklime and yellow phosphorus ahead of schedule. They entrusted Wang Yazhou to bring this news of production victory to Chairman Mao as a gift from all employees of the plant. After Wang Yazhou, a technician at the calcium carbide plant, was selected as a representative of Jilin Province to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, all employees felt very honored and excited. Labor heroes are respected by everyone, which directly boosted the morale for production. Under the leadership's call and the close cooperation of all cadres, technicians, and workers, a high level of work efficiency was brought into play. On August 27th and September 16th at 5:00 AM, they completed the annual production tasks of quicklime and yellow phosphorus four months ahead of schedule (the annual production task of calcium carbide is expected to be completed on September 22nd as well). The plant is now working hard to further complete overproduction. (Xiong Moyuan)
