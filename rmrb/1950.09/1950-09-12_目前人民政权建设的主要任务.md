　　The main tasks of the civil affairs departments at all levels currently are threefold: democratic political construction, relief work (including disaster relief, preferential treatment for families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs, and urban social relief), and demobilization work. All three are proactive and long-term endeavors. Among them, democratic political construction is particularly important. These three aspects should not be neglected or treated as mutually exclusive; they should be carried out through democratic political construction. We cannot put the other two main tasks aside because we are busy with democratic political construction. To this end, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central Government convened a national civil affairs conference to convey and discuss these tasks, with people's democratic political construction as the main topic, which is very timely and necessary.

　　The report of the National Civil Affairs Conference on people's democratic political construction should be taken seriously by Party and government workers at all levels and carefully organized for dissemination and discussion. Based on this, the achievements and shortcomings of this work over the past year and a half should be examined, especially the ideological understanding of cadres on the issue of political construction.

　　The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates: "To implement the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the alliance of workers and peasants, and uniting all democratic classes and nationalities within the country, to oppose imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." It can be seen that the content of the people's democratic dictatorship includes both democracy for the people and dictatorship over the enemy, which should be implemented in all work, especially in the construction of political power. The political power we are to establish nationwide, as stated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, is, on the one hand, "the political authority of the people's democratic united front composed of the Chinese working class, peasantry, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and other patriotic democratic elements." On the other hand, "for general reactionaries, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists, after disarming them and eliminating their special privileges, their political rights must still be deprived according to law for a necessary period." Our political construction work should be carried out correctly in accordance with this comprehensive guideline. The better we do our political power construction work, the more the people's democracy will be promoted, and the more consolidated the dictatorship over the enemy will be.

　　Political construction should be carried out step by step. The main task of political construction at present is to convene people's representative conferences of all circles, because the people's representative conferences of all circles are a better organizational form of the people's democratic united front in various places at present, and also a more appropriate system for the people to exercise political power. Therefore, we must not only hold people's representative conferences of all circles at all levels, but also gradually make them exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress and elect people's governments at all levels. This should be done in areas where land reform has been completed, and in some places where land reform has not been carried out, as long as the work is done well and the conditions are generally met, this can also be done. Our political system is a system of democratic centralism. Our people's representative conferences are not like the representative system of capitalist countries, which are organs for idle talk, wrangling, or checks and balances against the government. Our people's representative conferences and people's governments are a unified and organic whole for the people to exercise political power.

　　This work has not just started now; it has been done in various places for a year and a half, and has achieved many successes. Among them, the people's representative conferences of all circles in major administrative regions, provinces, and major cities have mostly become institutionalized, and some are preparing to convene. Various places already have many experiences and established rules that can be followed. Therefore, the focus of current work should generally be placed at the county level. The county is the hub connecting the upper and lower levels of political power. If the people's representative conference of all circles in the county is held well, the work of the county will receive the support of representatives of the people from all walks of life, and the county people's government can also be gradually elected, further promoting democracy. In this way, the improvement of district and township political power will be very easy. In the year and a half since then, of the 2,069 counties in the country (excluding banners), 1,707 counties have held county people's representative conferences of all circles. Those that have already been held should be made a regular system and gradually exercise the functions and powers of the people's congress; those that have not been held should be convened quickly and universally. The civil affairs departments of each province should focus on this work at present, and then gradually go deeper into districts and townships.

　　We should follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "We must conscientiously hold people's representative conferences of all circles that are sufficient to unite people from all walks of life to carry out work together." Uniting people from all walks of life to carry out work together is the fundamental purpose of the people's representative conferences of all circles. However, if we deviate from various specific tasks, the people's representative conferences of all circles will become formalistic. For example, at present, various places have many tasks such as disaster relief, demobilization, autumn grain collection, autumn plowing, land reform, rent reduction, rectification, preferential treatment, municipal administration, and relief, which the government should submit to the people's representative conferences of all circles for discussion, make resolutions, and mobilize the people to assist the government in its full efforts to implement them. At the same time, for the urgent problems raised by the people, the main ones should be selected and submitted to the meeting for discussion and resolution. If they cannot be resolved, they should be explained. Within a region, within a certain period, there will not be too many such pressing problems that are brought up at the meeting for resolution, and the meeting should accept them, submit them for discussion, and decide on solutions. The people's representative conferences of all circles should not only discuss the issues prepared and raised by the government, but also ignore the issues raised by the people.

　　Since the people's representative conferences of all circles are organizational forms of the people's democratic united front's political power, attention should be paid to the breadth of representation, and representatives from all aspects should be able to participate. At present, it is generally not appropriate to immediately conduct universal elections, but rather to adopt the method of consultation to elect and specially invite some representatives, so that representatives from all aspects can participate. This is much more democratic than universal elections under immature conditions, and it is also easier to take care of the minority aspects other than the working people in the quota of representatives. Attention should be paid to absorbing representatives from enlightened people, in order to unite all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal forces. We should adopt the method of consultation to seek the breadth of the composition of representatives, and at the same time, it is easy to listen to and concentrate the opinions of all parties when discussing and solving problems, including the opinions of a minority of representatives. These are all impossible for the false democratic system of capitalist countries to achieve. The so-called majority in the parliament of capitalist countries precisely represents the interests of the few ruling bourgeoisie; while the majority in our meetings truly represents the vast laboring people who are the majority. Our meetings also widely absorb representatives of the minority people to participate, listening to and absorbing opinions that are correct even if they are from a minority. By doing so, we can achieve true democratic centralism and unite the vast majority of the people. Every important task of our People's Government has been discussed by the conference, consulted by all parties, and repeatedly revised. Therefore, once a resolution is made, it will inevitably become a huge force unanimously supported by all parties.

### 目前人民政权建设的主要任务

　　目前人民政权建设的主要任务
    各级民政部门在目前有三件主要工作，这就是：民主建政、救济工作（包括救灾、优抚和城市社会救济等）和复员工作。所有这三件工作，都是积极性和长期性的工作。其中民主建政工作尤为重要。三者不可偏废和对立，应该通过民主建政去进行，不能因为忙于民主建政而将其他两件主要工作搁置不管。为此，中央内务部召集了全国民政会议，传达和讨论了这些工作，并以人民民主建政为主要议题，这是非常适时和必要的。
    全国民政会议关于人民民主建政的报告，各地各级党政工作人员都应该重视，认真组织传达和讨论。并依此以检查一年半以来这一工作的成绩和缺点，特别应该检查干部对建政问题的思想认识。
    中国人民政协共同纲领规定：“实行工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的、团结各民主阶级和国内各民族的人民民主专政，反对帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义”。可见人民民主专政的内容，包括有对人民民主与对敌人专政的两方面，应该贯彻于一切工作之中，特别是要贯彻到政权建设工作中去。我们要在全国范围内建立的政权，正如人民政协共同纲领所说，一方面，“中国人民民主专政是中国工人阶级、农民阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级及其他爱国民主分子的人民民主统一战线的政权”。另一方面，“对于一般的反动分子、封建地主、官僚资本家，在解除其武装、消灭其特殊势力后，仍须依法在必要时期内剥夺他们的政治权利”。我们的建政工作，应该依照这一全面的方针正确地去进行。我们政权建设工作越做得好，则人民的民主越发扬，对敌人的专政也就越巩固。
    建政要有步骤。目前建政的主要任务是开好各界人民代表会议，因为各界人民代表会议是目前各地人民民主统一战线的较好的组织形式，也是目前人民行使政权的较合时宜的制度。因之，我们不仅要开好各级的各界人民代表会议，而且要逐步地使之代行人民代表大会的职权，选举各级人民政府。在土地改革完成的地区要这样做，在未进行土改的有些地方，只要工作作好，而条件大体上具备了，也可以这样做。我们的政权制度，是民主集中的制度。我们的人民代表会议，不是如资本主义国家的代议制那样的清谈和吵嚷或是和政府牵制对立的机关，我们人民代表会议和人民政府，是人民行使政权统一的有机的整体。
    这一工作，不是现在才开始的；一年半以来，各地都在做，而且收到了不少的成绩。其中，各大行政区、省和各大城市的各界人民代表会议，大多已成为制度，有的正准备召开。各地已有许多经验和成规，可以取法。所以目前的工作重心，一般应该放在县级。县是上下级政权沟通的枢纽。县各界人民代表会议开好了，县的工作就得到了各方面人民代表的支持，县人民政府也可以随着逐步地由选举产生，进一步的发扬民主。这样，区乡政权的改进就很容易了。一年半以来，全国二千零六十九个县（不包括旗），已开过县各界人民代表会议的，计有一千七百零七个县。已开过的，应该使之成为经常制度，并逐步代行人民代表大会职权；未开过的，应该迅速普遍召开。各省的民政部门，目前应该注重这一工作，然后逐渐深入到区乡。
    我们应该按照毛主席的指示：“必须认真地开好足以团结各界人民共同进行工作的各界人民代表会议。”团结各界人民共同进行工作，这是各界人民代表会议的根本目的。但是，如果离开了各项具体工作，就会使各界人民代表会议流为形式主义的东西。譬如目前各地有救灾、复员、秋征、秋耕、土改、减租、整风、优抚、市政、救济等许多工作，政府都应分别提交各界人民代表会议讨论，做出决议，并动员人民协助政府全力去执行。同时，对于人民提出的急待解决的问题，应选择其主要的交由会议讨论解决。不能解决的应加以解释。在一地之内，在一定的时期，被提到会议上要求解决的这类迫切问题，总不会太多，会议都应该加以接受，交付讨论，议定处理办法。各界人民代表会议不应该仅仅讨论政府准备与提出的问题，而忽视人民群众所提出的问题。
    各界人民代表会议既然是人民民主统一战线的政权组织形式，因此就要注意到代表的广泛性，应该使各方面的代表人物都能参加。目前一般地尚不宜立即进行普选，而应采取协商的方式来推选及特邀一些代表，使各方面代表人物都能参加进来。这较之条件不成熟的普选更要民主得多，在代表的比额上，也易于照顾劳动人民以外的少数方面。对开明人士中的代表人物，应注意加以吸收，以便团结一切反帝反封建的力量。我们应采用协商的方式以求得代表成份的广泛，同时即是求得在讨论与解决问题时易于听取和集中各方面的意见，其中也包括代表少数人的意见.这些都是资本主义国家的假民主制度所不可能做到的。资本主义国家的议会中的所谓多数，恰恰是代表少数，代表为数甚少的居于统治地位的资产阶级的利益；而我们的会议中的多数，则是真正的代表多数的广大的劳动人民。我们的会议同时又广泛吸收代表少数人民的代表参加，倾听和吸收虽是少数人但是正确的意见。我们这样做，就能实现真正的民主集中，使绝大多数人民团结一致。我们人民政府的每一重要工作，都经过会议的讨论与各方的协商和反复修正，因此，一经决议就必然成为各方一致拥护的巨大力量。
