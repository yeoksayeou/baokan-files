　　US Military in Japan
　　(1)
　　In January 1950, a group of top U.S. military leaders, headed by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley, "visited" Japan. From that time on, the U.S. occupation forces stationed in Japan more obviously prepared for wars of aggression, intending to serve as an important wing in the U.S.'s global war against the Soviet Union.
　　In fact, the aggressive war preparations of the U.S. forces stationed in Japan had already become quite concrete in the fall of last year, when General Walker, a tank warfare expert, succeeded Eichelberger as commander of the Eighth Army. At that time, the occupation forces were reorganized into combat troops and focused on combat training. In mid-June of this year, before Secretary of Defense Johnson, Bradley, John Foster Dulles, and State Department advisor Dulles arrived in Japan, a large-scale landing combat exercise involving the army, navy, and air force of the entire Far East region was already planned, centered on Sagami Bay. The war of aggression against Korea broke out shortly after this exercise; therefore, we can well understand that the outbreak of the Korean War was not accidental.

　　American and Japanese journalists often debated the strategic value of the Japanese archipelago. However, it is generally believed that Japan's strategic value is very small; therefore, in the event of an anti-Soviet war, the United States would not necessarily defend Japan and might withdraw immediately. Even some Japanese people, based on this view stemming from subjective wishes, hold an optimistic attitude towards the danger of war. But in fact, the U.S. military is blatantly carrying out the work of turning the Japanese archipelago into a military base.
　　The U.S. occupation forces have not only repaired the Yokosuka naval port, one of the leading ports in the Far East, but are also working day and night on the repair of Sasebo, Kure, Hakodate, and other naval ports. On the other hand, nearly thirty air force base networks have been built throughout Japan, and radar networks have been set up along the long Japanese coastline, from Hokkaido in the north to Kyushu in the south. Especially recently, they have begun to expand the Kanto base group and the base groups in Kanoya, Kagoshima Prefecture, and Sukumo, Kochi Prefecture, which are linked to Okinawa Island, on a larger scale. Most of these expenses are paid from taxes extracted from the Japanese people in the name of "war aftermath expenses."
　　Japan's heavy industry and old military industries are also being used for U.S. military plans in this form. One form is to designate certain factories as direct factories (P.D. factories) for U.S. military plans, engaged in the production and repair of weapons; another form is to retain their "independence," and then accept U.S. military supplies orders through the Japanese government's Special Procurement Board. At present, Japan's entire economy is completely dominated by the production of these military supplies and the use of these payments. Under these circumstances, industries and peace industries that have not colluded with the United States are facing a crisis of collapse. Not only that, but this situation has also created corruption and depravity among U.S. military personnel and bureaucrats. The major corruption cases that have occurred in Japan after the war, such as the Showa Denko incident, have all occurred in collusion with American military personnel and bureaucrats.
　　(3)
　　The U.S. occupation forces often manipulate two opposing political forces to strengthen their control over Japan. This manipulation is carried out in the following way: on the one hand, some people, led by Major General Willoughby of the Second Section (G2) of MacArthur Headquarters, are closely united with Shigeru Yoshida and his faction, old soldiers, and right-wingers, and use Japan's old militarist forces as pawns in the U.S. aggressive policy. On the other hand, some people, led by Brigadier General Courtney Whitney of the Government Section, support the Katayama and Ashida factions, advocating moderate politics. However, since the Wall Street reactionary forces openly began to promote war plans, the influence of the moderate political faction has been significantly weakened, and the policy of attempting to rearm Japan as a pawn in the U.S. war of aggression has taken the most important position. The specific manifestation of this policy is first to force the Japanese Communist Party to become virtually illegal, in order to undermine the JCP's influence among the people, and to establish a 75,000-strong police reserve force and strengthen the Maritime Safety Agency, thereby further suppressing all people's forces.
　　Shigeru Yoshida has openly advocated intervention in the Korean War and assistance to the U.S. military. Shigeru Yoshida and his party are extremely fearful of a peace conference with Japan attended by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and attempt to create a de facto state of peace unilaterally with the United States, catering to the U.S. policy of permanent military control over Japan. Shigeru Yoshida and his cronies are planning to lift the purge orders against the leaders of Japanese imperialism, especially political figures such as Ichiro Hatoyama, leaders of the financial cliques, and old soldiers, and restore their activities.
　　(4)
　　However, on the other hand, the Japanese people's aversion to war and their demand for peace are increasing day by day. This aversion to war and demand for peace has also developed widely among U.S. soldiers. In early July, an incident occurred in Tokyo in which some black soldiers distributed leaflets against the war and were arrested by U.S. military police for launching a signature campaign against sending troops to Korea. The American soldiers sent to fight in Korea were decided by lottery from the U.S. occupation forces stationed in Japan, but the soldiers who were selected almost all ran to the brothels set up for American soldiers to cry. In Gifu Prefecture, a group of black soldiers refused to be sent to Korea, fired guns, and forced the train to stop for six hours. The more blatantly the U.S. military reveals its mad intention of aggression, the more the Japanese people's anti-war and anti-American sentiments rise.
　　Obviously, the U.S. occupation forces are extremely fearful of the Japanese people's anti-American and anti-war feelings and the consequences of their development; therefore, they are increasingly frantically suppressing the democratic forces of the Japanese people, led by the Japanese Communist Party. All democratic gatherings or parades are prohibited, and newspapers and leaflets with anti-American and anti-war colors have suffered ruthless suppression, which is virtually equivalent to declaring martial law.
　　Nevertheless, a resistance organization in the Japanese people led by the Japanese Communist Party, including a wide range of workers, intellectuals and farmers. has adopted new ways to conduct a vigorous struggle. The fate of the American imperialist army stationed in Japan and the Japanese domestic reactionary forces colluding with the U.S. military is destined to fail in the face of the awakened Japanese people, and the actual situation it has encountered in China and other Far Eastern countries is sufficient to prove this judgment.

### 美军在日本

　　美军在日本
    （一）
    一九五○年一月，以参谋长联席会议主席布莱特雷为首的美国军部最高首脑部的一批人员“访问”了日本。从这个时候起，驻扎在日本的美国占领军就更明显地准备侵略战争，打算充任美国在全世界规模上对苏战争中的重要一翼。
    事实上，在去年秋季坦克战专家瓦克中将继艾肯伯格接任第八军司令官的时候，驻日美军的侵略战争准备就已相当的具体化。当时，占领军各部队被重新改编为战斗部队，并注重战斗训练。今年六月中旬，在国防部长詹森，布莱特雷，约翰·郝斯德，国务院顾问杜勒斯等抵达日本之前，原已计划以相漠湾为中心，举行由整个远东区域陆海空军参加的大规模的登陆战斗演习。就在这个演习之后不久，侵略朝鲜的战争便爆发了，因此，我们很可以理解到朝鲜战争的发生，并不是偶然的。
    （二）
    关于日本列岛的战略价值，美国和日本的新闻记者经常在纷纷争论中。然而一般都认为：日本的战略价值很小，因此，一旦发生反苏战争，美国不至于固守日本，可能立刻撤退。甚至一部分日本人也依据这种出自主观愿望的看法，对战争的危险性抱着乐观的态度。但事实上美军却正在露骨地进行日本列岛军事基地化的工作。
    美国占领军不但已修复了远东首屈一指的横须贺军港，而且正在日以继夜地从事于佐世保，吴港，函馆等各军港的修复工程；另一方面，日本全国建设了将近三十处的空军基地网，同时，又沿着北自北海道，南至九洲的漫长的日本海岸线上设置雷达网。尤其在最近，更大规模地开始扩充关东基地群及与冲绳岛连结在一起的鹿儿岛县鹿屋、高知县宿毛的基地群。这些费用的大部分，是以“战争善后费”的名义从日本人身上抽来的税金中拨付的。
    日本的重工业和旧军需工业也在这种形式下被利用于美国的军事计划。其形式的一种，是将某些工厂划为美国军事计划的直辖工厂（Ｐ·Ｄ·工厂），从事武器的生产和修理；另外一种，则仍然保留其“独立性”，然后通过日本政府的特别调达厅接受美国的军用品订货。目前，日本的整个经济完全受着这些军用品的生产和这些货款的运用所支配。在这种情形之下，未曾与美国勾结在一起的工业与和平产业，正面临着崩溃的危机。非但如此，这种情形同时亦造成了美军军人和官僚的腐化堕落。如昭和电工事件等战后在日本陆续发生的大贪污案件，都是在美国军人与官僚勾结下所发生的。
    （三）
    美国占领军经常操纵着两个对立的政治势力，以加强其对日本的支配。这种操纵，是以下面的这种方式进行着的：一方面是以麦克阿瑟司令部参谋第二课（Ｇ２）魏洛比少将为首的一些人，与吉田茂及其同派系的人物和旧军人，右派等紧紧地结合起来，并利用日本旧军国主义势力作为美国侵略政策的爪牙，另一方面则以民政局霍意德尼准将为首的一些人，支持着片山、芦田一派，主张中庸政治。然而，自从华尔街反动势力公开地开始推进战争计划以后，中庸政治派的势力已显著地削弱，而企图重新武装日本作为美国侵略战争的爪牙的政策，则已占了最重要的地位。这种政策的具体表现，首先便是迫使日本共产党实际上变成不合法化，以图破坏日共在人民群众中的影响，并建立七万五千名的警察后备队和加强海上警备队，从而进一步抑压一切人民势力。
    吉田茂已公然主张干涉朝鲜战争和协助美军。吉田茂及其同党极端恐惧苏联和中华人民共和国参加的对日媾和会议，妄图与美国单独造成。一种事实上的和约状态，迎合美国永久对日本的军事支配的政策。吉田茂和他的党羽，正在策动解除对日本帝国主义的指导者们，尤其如政治头目鸠山一郎与财阀指导者们以及旧军人的整肃令，并使其恢复活动。
    （四）
    然而，另一方面，日本人民对于战争的厌恶和对于和平的要求，却在日益加强。这种厌恶战争要求和平的情绪，同样已在美军士兵之间广泛地发展着。七月初旬，在东京曾经发生过一部分黑人士兵散发反对战争的传单，及因发动反对出兵朝鲜签名运动而横遭美国宪兵逮捕的事件。派往朝鲜作战的美国兵，是从驻日占领军中用抽签的方式作决定的，然而中签的士兵，差不多都为此而跑到专为美兵设立的娼妓处去大哭一场。在岐阜县，曾有一群黑人士兵拒绝被送往朝鲜，发射手枪，迫使火车停驶达六小时之久。美军愈是露骨地暴露了疯狂的侵略意图，日本人民的反战反美情绪也愈益高涨起来。
    显然，美国占领军是极端恐惧日本人这种反美反战的感情及其发展的后果的，因此，愈益疯狂地弹压以日本共产党为先锋的日本人民的民主势力。一切民主集会或游行，均被禁止，带有反美反战色彩的报纸及传单，遭受了无情的弹压，事实上已等于宣布了戒严令。
    虽然如此，在日本人民方面一种以日本共产党为领导的，包括广泛的劳动者，知识分子及农民的抵抗组织。已经采取新的方式进行有力的斗争了。美国帝国主义驻在日本的军队以及勾结美军的日本国内反动势力的命运，在觉醒了的日本人民面前，是注定了要失败的，它在中国及其他远东国家所遭遇的实际情况已经足以证明这一种判断了。（七月十六日寄）（康大川译）。
