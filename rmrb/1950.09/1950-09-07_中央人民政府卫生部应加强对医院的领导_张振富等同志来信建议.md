Comrades Zhang Zhenfu and Others Suggest the Central People's Government's Ministry of Health Should Strengthen Leadership Over Hospitals

Comrades Zhang Zhenfu and Li Tianwu write to the editor:

We believe that since its establishment, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has made achievements in its work; however, its work still falls short of the demands of the masses. For example, in hospitals in Beijing, Tianjin, Baoding, Tanggu and other places, which have been liberated for nearly two years, serious incidents of dereliction of duty in treatment continue to occur. After these incidents occur, we rarely see the Ministry of Health issue any instructions or reflections.

Therefore, we suggest that during the rectification movement, the Ministry of Health should plan how to take appropriate measures promptly and effectively to strengthen leadership over various hospitals to prevent irresponsible phenomena in treatment work.

Comrade Hanliu writes to the editor:

After reading the criticism of the work of the North China People's Hospital in the "People's Garden," I feel that this is a serious issue.

Taking this opportunity, I would like to talk about the problems existing in medical work that I have seen and my opinions.

First, medical work has made progress since liberation. Especially in public medical departments, the vast majority of new and old staff members have made contributions and achieved results for the revolution and the people. However, problems similar to those that have occurred in the People's Hospital are by no means unique to the People's Hospital, but exist or have occurred in many health and medical departments. For example, some doctors in the outpatient department of Beijing Hospital (Nos. 3 and 4 in internal medicine) (this is what I and several comrades personally saw) are very irresponsible to patients. They just ask a few cursory questions, write a prescription, and give the patient some harmless medicine. Sometimes when patients complain about their condition, they don't like to listen, find it troublesome and verbose, and want the patient to leave quickly. Their attitude towards patients is also very cold.

In the hospital in Kaifeng, Henan, I also saw this intolerable phenomenon. For example, in April of this year, I went to the Kaifeng Railway Hospital to see a hospitalized comrade. In a small room less than eight feet long and wide, there were two patients (one with malaria and one with typhoid fever), and the air was extremely bad. Under the bed was a bedpan full of urine and feces, and the stench was overwhelming. When the nurse brought porridge to the patient, she still ignored the bedpan and left.

This serious problem should be taken seriously by the health administration department, and it must not be regarded as an isolated problem, while neglecting in-depth inspection and correction in this regard.

Second, it is hoped that the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government will launch an inspection campaign from top to bottom and from bottom to top to oppose this bad ideology and style, thereby educating medical workers, improving their skills, and improving their work. This work should be placed on the agenda of every health and medical unit as a regular task.

Third, if medical workers commit serious errors, such as incidents caused by negligence or irresponsibility, the leading organs should investigate and give them due punishment. This should be listed as a discipline of medical work in the future. Although this is a passive method, it can still achieve some results under today's conditions.

Fourth, strengthen the political education and ideological transformation of medical staff, so that they can establish the concept of serving the people, and improve their professional skills and working abilities.

Editor's note: The opinions put forward in the letters from Comrades Zhang Zhenfu, Li Tianwu, and Hanliu are basically correct. The irresponsible phenomena that exist in some health and medical departments are very unfavorable to the people. Therefore, the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government should lead the national health and medical departments in this rectification movement to thoroughly examine this undesirable phenomenon in order to improve work. After being criticized by the newspaper, the North China People's Hospital conducted a relatively in-depth examination, which resulted in certain improvements in its work. This fact is a very good experience.

Comrade Hanliu suggested in his letter: "If medical workers commit serious errors, such as incidents caused by negligence or irresponsibility, the leading organs should investigate and give them due punishment." This is necessary in principle. However, in the execution, it is necessary to carefully analyze the situation, judge the cause of the error and the magnitude of the responsibility, and deal with them separately, so as to avoid causing some medical workers to be afraid to treat patients. However, in the basic aspect, the spirit of exemplary health and medical workers should be promoted, the enthusiasm of all health and medical staff to serve the people should be stimulated, so that all health and medical staff can consciously be serious and responsible, and improve their work. Punishment should not be the main means of promoting the improvement of health and medical work.

### 中央人民政府卫生部应加强对医院的领导  张振富等同志来信建议

专栏：

　　中央人民政府卫生部应加强对医院的领导
    张振富等同志来信建议
    张振富、李天武同志来信编辑同志：
    我们认为，中央人民政府卫生部自成立以来，工作是有成绩的；但是它的工作却还赶不上群众的要求。例如解放将近二年的京、津、保、塘等地医院，都不断地发生着严重的治疗失责的事件。而在事故发生以后，我们很少看见过卫生部发出什么指示和检讨。
    因此，我们建议：在整风运动中，卫生部应计划一下，如何及时地、有效地采取适当措置，加强对各医院的领导，以防止治疗工作中的不负责任现象。
    杨柳青镇河北省、天津市联防指挥部张振富、李天武
    寒流同志来信编辑同志：
    看了“人民园地”关于华北人民医院工作的批评以后，我觉得这是一个严重的问题。
    乘此机会，我把我所看到的医务工作上存在的问题和我的意见说一下。
    第一，解放后的医务工作是有进步的。特别是公立医务部门中，绝大部分的新旧工作人员对革命、对人民都是有贡献、有成绩的。但是，类似人民医院所发生的问题，决不只是人民医院发生过，而是不少卫生医务部门存在着或是发生过的问题。如北京医院的门诊部（这是我和几个同志亲眼看到的）的某些大夫（内科三、四号），对病人是很不负责任的，只是潦草地问一下，就写个单子，让病人吃点不关痛痒的药。有时病人诉说自己的病情，他们也不爱听，嫌麻烦啰嗦，要病人快点离开，对病人的态度也非常冷淡。
    在河南开封的医院，我也看到这种使人不能容忍的现象。如今年四月间，我到开封铁路医院去看一个住院的同志。在一间长宽不到八尺的小屋里，住有两位病号（一个是疟疾，一个是伤寒），空气极坏。病床下面放着一个满装尿粪的便盆，臭气扑鼻。当护士送稀饭给病人吃的时候，仍然不管便盆就走了。
    这种严重的问题，应该引起卫生行政部门的重视，决不能以为这是个别问题，而忽视了这方面的深入检查和纠正。
    第二，希望中央人民政府卫生部展开一个从上到下，从下到上的检查运动，反对这种恶劣的思想和作风，从而教育医务工作者，提高技术，改进工作。应该把这个工作列入每一个卫生医务单位的议事日程上，作为一个经常性的工作。
    第三，医务工作者犯了严重错误，如因疏忽、不负责任而造成的事件，领导机关应加追究，给以应得的处理。这在今后应列作医务工作的纪律。这虽是一个消极的办法，但在今天的条件下，还是能得到一些效果的。
    第四，加强医务工作人员的政治教育和思想改造工作，使他们树立为人民服务的观念，并提高他们的业务和工作能力。
    中央公安部  寒流
    编者按：张振富、李天武和寒流同志来信所提出的意见，基本上是正确的。现在某些卫生医务部门中所存在的不负责任的现象，对人民是十分不利的。因此，中央人民政府卫生部应在这次整风运动中领导全国卫生医务部门来彻底检查这种不应有的现象，以改进工作。华北人民医院经过报纸批评后，进行了比较深刻的检查，因而使工作有了一定的改进。这件事实就是一个很好的经验。
    寒流同志来信提出：“医务工作者犯了严重错误，如因疏忽、不负责任而造成的事件，领导机关应加追究，给以应得的处理。”这，在原则上是必要的。但是在执行的时候，必须认真地分析情况，判别错误发生的原因和责任的大小，分别处理，以免造成某些医务工作者不敢替病人治病的偏向。然而，基本的方面，应当发扬模范的卫生医务工作者的精神，激发所有卫生医务工作人员的为人民服务的热情，使所有卫生医务工作人员能自觉地认真负责，改进工作。惩罚不应当是促进卫生医务工作改进的主要手段。
