　　Mutual Aid Model Huang Yongde
    Leads Impoverished Peasants on the Road to Prosperity, Transforming Loafers into Diligent Producers.
    In the vicinity of Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, if you ask the locals about where Huang Yongde lives, they will say, "Are you asking about the model worker? He lives in Zhangjia Wopu in Yongle District." They will also tell you: Huang Yongde's family even has a set of new Soviet-style farm tools!
    Huang Yongde is an ordinary farmer, 56 years old this year, with a family of seven. His tall frame has been slightly bent by decades of hard labor, and his kind face is covered with wrinkles. Before liberation, he did not own a single room or a single piece of land. After liberation, during the land reform, he was allocated land and housing. He also actively responded to the government's call to "organize to improve production."
    In 1946, his mutual aid group had only two households; the following year, it increased to four households. In 1948, it increased to eight households. The newly added four households included Tang Zongliang, a loafer rejected by other exchange labor groups; Hao Fengqi, who had run a small stall; Lu Desheng, a former Taoist priest; and a landlord after the land reform. At that time, the group's production conditions were: 22.5 *qing* of cultivated land, one cow, three horses, and one cart. In terms of food, Huang Yongde's family had six *shi*, Lan Guozhong's family had four *shi*, and the other six households had enough for half a month, or twenty days. On the first day of the group's formation, Huang Yongde gathered them together and asked, "Are you all willing to produce?" They replied in unison: "Yes!" But they raised many difficulties: lack of food, lack of farming tools, and lack of skills. Huang Yongde said, "Don't worry, I'll lend you food, I have ropes and tools at home, and I'll teach you how to work if you don't know how!"
    For the first two days of work, everything was fine, and Huang Yongde often encouraged them. But after a few days, Tang Zongliang, the loafer, felt weak and his legs ached, and he couldn't bend down to work, so he asked for a break. Huang Yongde seized the opportunity to educate him, saying, "Labor habits are developed gradually. The first few days of work are tiring, but you'll get used to it after a few days. Surely you, a young man, are not worse than this old man like me?" He persuaded him every day, and Tang Zongliang was embarrassed to take a break. One day, Tang Zongliang had a relapse of his laziness and lay in bed refusing to get up. Huang Yongde gathered all the group members to criticize him: "Before, when you smoked opium, people didn't treat you like a human being. Now you have livestock and land, you should work hard! Otherwise, what do you expect to live on? In this day and age, you can't survive without working!" Tang Zongliang admitted his mistake and also educated the others.
    When hoeing began, Huang Yongde's family also didn't have much grain left. The days were getting longer, and they were eating more. Huang Yongde mobilized the women to dig wild vegetables. Soon, the government lent them a batch of soybean cakes. Every morning, they ate porridge with wild vegetables, at noon they ate cornbread made from unhusked millet, and in the evening they ate wild vegetables mixed with soybean cake flour. Because Huang Yongde managed things well, they successfully survived the summer grain shortage.
    When hoeing, Tang Zongliang, An Zilin, and Hao Fengqi didn't know how to use a hoe, so Huang Yongde patiently taught them. But they weren't used to working under the hot sun and couldn't bear it. But then they thought: What is Lao Huang doing this for? He's teaching us how to work, and he's tightening his belt and going through the famine with us. If it weren't for Lao Huang, we might have starved to death! Thinking of this, they no longer slacked off. They worked harder, and the sorghum, millet, and soybeans were hoed and tilled three times. That autumn (1948), Huang Yongde harvested an average of 9 *shi* 8 *dou* and 4 *sheng* per *qing* of land, and the whole group averaged 7 *shi* per *qing*. Given the production conditions at the time, this was a significant achievement.
    Before hoeing began in 1949, it was slightly dry, and the farmers waited for rain before hoeing. Huang Yongde took the lead in leading his group to start hoeing and challenged everyone during the village meeting, which motivated the farmers to start in time. Near the end of hoeing, the drought became very severe. The government estimated that there would be a poor harvest and called on farmers to grow vegetables, dig wild vegetables, and save for famine relief. Huang Yongde was the first to respond, mobilizing the group to plant cabbage and radishes in the wheat fields, and organizing the group to make a lot of thatch, which they sold to buy grain.
    Because of Huang Yongde's successful leadership in production last year, he not only gained the love and trust of his group members, but also many farmers in the village felt that he had experience and methods in leading exchange labor groups, and they all asked to join his exchange labor group. For example, Cheng Shaotang's large group in the village insisted on merging with them. After the merger, there were a total of 26 households and 77.69 *qing* of land. Cheng Shaotang's original group had 14 households short of grain and 8 households short of fodder. At that time, some people advocated eliminating these households to avoid burdening everyone. Huang Yongde refused, saying that we were all in difficulty before, and we must help each other and overcome poverty. He patiently led everyone in production, lending grain and fodder to the households in difficulty, and with the government's loans, the difficulties were resolved. His outstanding achievements in leading the exchange labor group in production led to his being selected as a model worker at the district, county, and provincial levels several times. In January of this year, the Northeast People's Government lent him a brand-new set of Soviet-made animal-drawn farm tools. This event caused a sensation in Songjiang Province. Farmers from nearby districts and villages, staff members of the provincial and county governments, and reporters from newspapers all ran to visit this old man who was the first in the province to use new farm tools.
    During the spring plowing, the Northeast People's Government sent technicians to teach them how to use the new farm tools. After a month, Huang Yongde, Cheng Shaotang, Lao Huang's daughter, and others became skilled technicians. The whole group used the new farm tools to plant 7.2 *qing* of Ukrainian wheat, 2 *qing* of sugar beets, 2 *qing* of "Full Granary Gold" soybeans, and 5 *qing* of corn. In addition, they used a double-wheeled single-furrow plow to open 7 *qing* of wasteland, saving a lot of labor and horse labor, and accomplishing a lot more work.
    In February, Huang Yongde and his daughter and son-in-law joined the Chinese Communist Party on the same day. This was hailed as a good story by the people in the village. In March, Songjiang Province held its first People's Representative Conference, and he was invited as a representative and was also elected as a member of the Provincial People's Government Committee.
    Huang Yongde not only led his own group well and motivated the farmers in the whole village, but also farmers from other districts and areas often came to learn from him. Many agricultural production labor models in various counties of Songjiang Province have proposed: "Learn from Huang Yongde, follow Huang Yongde's example." Huang Yongde's deeds have inspired the farmers' enthusiasm and confidence in production.
    In the new society, Huang Yongde improved his life with his own hands. He currently has two horses, two cows, two carts, and ten *qing* of land. Compared with the past when he had only two rice bowls and half a *dou* of rice, it is like heaven and earth. Huang Yongde often says to people: "My prosperous life, my glory, are all given by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Otherwise, with my life of suffering, having carried the burden of thirty-seven or eight years, how could I have today!"

　　互助模范黄永德
    领导贫苦农民走上富裕生活的道路，改造二流子勤劳生产成为新人。
    在松江省双城县附近，如果你问老乡们打听黄永德住在那里，他们会这样说：“你问劳模吗？他住在永乐区张家窝铺。”随后还会告诉你：黄永德家里还有一套苏联新式农具哩！
    黄永德是个普通的庄稼人，今年五十六岁了，全家共有七口人。他那高高的身躯，被几十年的劳苦岁月折磨得微弯了，慈祥的脸上布满了皱纹。这位解放前房无一间、地无一垅的受苦人，解放后，在土地改革中分得了土地和房屋，他并积极响应了政府所提出的“组织起来提高生产”的号召。
    一九四六年，他的互助小组只有两户，次年增加到四户。一九四八年增加到八户。新增加的四户中，包括别的换工组不要的二流子唐宗梁，摆过小摊的郝凤起，还俗老道陆德胜，还有一户土地改革以后的地主。当时全组的生产条件是：耕地二十二垧半，牛一头，马三匹，车一辆；吃粮呢，黄永德家里有六石，组员蓝国仲家有四石，其他六户各有半月、二十天吃的不等。编组的第一天，黄永德就召集他们开会，问道：“大家愿不愿意生产？”齐声回答说：愿意！但是他们提出了很多困难：缺吃粮，缺种地的家具，没有本事。黄永德说：“不怕，没粮我借给你们，绳套家具我家有，不会做活我来教！”
    开始干活的头两天还好，黄永德常常鼓励他们。可是过了几天，二流子唐宗梁手软腿酸煞不下腰，要求歇工。黄永德就抓紧时机教育他说：“劳动习惯是慢慢养成的，头两天干活累，熬过这几天就好了，难道你这青年小伙子还不如我这老头子？”他每天这样劝说着，唐宗梁便不好意思歇工了。有一天，唐宗梁赖病复发，躺在炕上不起来。黄永德召集了全组的人去批评他：“以前你抽大烟，人家不拿你当人看；如今你有牲口有地，就该好好干活！要不你指望什么来生活呢？如今不劳动可吃不开呀！”唐宗梁承认了错误，同时也教育了其他的人。
    开铲时，黄永德家剩的粮食也不多了，天又长，正是吃粮多的时候。黄永德就发动妇女挖野菜。不久，政府贷下了一批豆饼，他们这组每天早上稀饭加野菜，中午吃带皮的谷子面饽饽，晚上吃野菜掺豆饼面。因为黄永德调配得好，胜利地度过了夏季粮荒。
    铲地时，唐宗梁、安子林和郝凤起都不会使锄，黄永德就耐心地教导他们。但他们都没有在烈日下劳动的习惯，觉得受不了。不过又一想：人家老黄是为了什么，教咱们干活，还勒紧了肚皮和咱们一起度荒。要不是老黄，说不定咱们就会饿死！想到这里，也就不再怠慢了。他们干活加了劲，高粱、谷子、豆子都铲、趟了三遍。当年（一九四八）秋天，黄永德一垧地平均打了九石八斗四升，全组平均起来，一垧地打七石。根据当时的生产条件，这个成绩是不小的。
    一九四九年开铲之前，天稍旱，农民都等雨不铲地。黄永德首先带领全组人下地开铲，并趁村里开大会的时候向大家挑战，推动了农民及时下手。将近挂锄时，天旱得非常厉害。政府估计将要歉收，号召农民种菜蔬，挖野菜，节约备荒。黄永德首先响应，动员全组在麦地里种了白菜、萝卜，组织全组打了很多苫房草，卖了钱买进粮食。
    由于黄永德去年领导生产有成绩，不仅得到本组组员的爱戴和信任，就连村里的许多农民都觉得他领导换工组有经验，有办法，纷纷要求参加他的换工组。如本村程少堂的一个大组，一定要求合编进来。两组合并后，共有二十六户，七十七垧六亩九分地。程少堂原组有十四户缺粮，八户缺马料。当时有人主张把这些户淘汰出去，免得带累了大家。黄永德不肯，他说，我们原先也都是困难户，要互相帮助，战胜贫困。他很耐心地领导大家生产，借给困难户粮草，加上政府的贷粮，便解决了困难。领导换工组生产的突出成绩，使黄永德几次地被选为区、县和全省的模范。今年一月，东北人民政府贷给他一套崭新的苏联马拉农具。这件事轰动了松江省，附近区、村的农民，省、县政府的工作人员，以及报社的记者们，都跑来访问这位全省第一个使用新农具的老人。
    春耕时，东北人民政府派来技术人员教导他们使用新农具。一个月后，黄永德、程少堂、老黄的女儿等人，就成了熟练的技术人材。全组用新农具种了七垧二亩乌克兰小麦，两垧甜菜，两垧“满仓金”大豆，五垧苞米。此外，用双轮一铧犁开了七垧荒，省了很多人工马工，又多做出了很多活。
    二月，黄永德和女儿、女婿在同一天加入了中国共产党。这被村里的人们传为佳话。三月松江省召开首届各界人民代表会议，他被邀请为代表，又被选为省人民政府委员会委员。
    黄永德不但领导好自己的小组，带动了全村的农民；本区、外区的农民也常跑来向他学习。松江省各县的很多农业生产劳动模范，都提出：“向黄永德学习，向黄永德看齐”。黄永德的事迹鼓舞了农民们的生产热情与信心。
    在新社会，黄永德凭着双手提高了生活。他目前有两匹马，两头牛，两辆车，十垧地，如和过去两只饭碗半斗米的光景比较，真是天上地下。黄永德常对人说：“我的富裕生活，我的光荣，都是共产党、毛主席给的。若不是，就凭咱这扛过三十七、八年大活的受苦人，那能有今天！”
