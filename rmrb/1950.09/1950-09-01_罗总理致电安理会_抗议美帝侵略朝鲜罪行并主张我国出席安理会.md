Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, August 31st: The Romanian News Agency reported from Bucharest on the 29th that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic, Groza, on behalf of the government of the Romanian People's Republic, sent a telegram to the President of the Security Council, Malik, protesting the American aggression against Korea, stating: The Romanian government believes that the conflict caused by the intervention of the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force in Korea is a serious blow to the peace and freedom of the Asian people, and a threat to international peace and security. Representing the Romanian people's aspirations for peace, the Romanian government declares that it fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal at the Security Council meeting on August 4th: to allow representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Security Council; to listen to the opinions of the Korean people's representatives during the consideration of the Korean issue; to cease military actions and withdraw foreign troops from Korea. The Romanian government believes that the Soviet Union's proposal is in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the will of peace-loving people worldwide.

The telegram strongly condemns the US government's conspiracies and tricks to obstruct the proceedings in the Security Council, pointing out that its purpose is to cover up the crimes of the United States in barbarously bombing Korean civilians and to obstruct a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue.
