　　Xinhua News Agency, August 30th: The national rubber industry conference convened by the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central People's Government has formulated the current production policy for the rubber industry and the production plan for 1951. Based on the production capacity of the national rubber industry, the supply of major raw materials, and the needs of transportation, industrial and mining construction, and people's daily use in the recent two years, the conference decided that the current production policy of the rubber industry is: to generally maintain, focus on reorganization and restoration, avoid blind expansion, and gradually move towards planned production. The conference also decided that in the future, under the guidance of the national construction plan, the rubber industry should focus on and gradually develop towards the manufacturing of production materials such as automobile tires and rubber belts.

　　In order to overcome losses caused by blind production, the conference, based on the principle of balancing production and sales, set the minimum and maximum planned output for the whole country and different regions. The minimum figure applies to the second half of this year, while the maximum figure adapts to the possibility of a slight increase in domestic sales next year. As for the specific production figures, the Ministry of Light Industry will flexibly control and adjust them in a timely manner. Regarding the allocation of production figures for each factory, the conference decided that the local industrial authorities should grasp the spirit of considering both public and private interests, rewarding progress, taking care of history, and taking care of the overall situation to guide the rubber trade association in the allocation.

　　In view of the rubber industry's long-standing dependence on foreign supplies for raw materials, the conference, based on the principle of self-reliance, studied ways to open up a domestic self-sufficiency road and formulated specific methods and steps for self-sufficiency in the production of raw rubber and chemical ingredients. At the same time, it also formulated raw material import plans and conservation methods to help solve the current raw material difficulties. The conference brought together technical experts from public and private factories to uniformly stipulate the names, units, and specifications of rubber raw materials and products, as well as the raw material consumption standards for several major products. The conference also conducted discussions on how to improve operations and production and reached a consensus.

　　The conference was held from July 15th to 27th. More than 70 people attended, including representatives of public and private rubber industries, experts, and representatives from industrial authorities in major cities and relevant departments of the Central People's Government.

　　轻工业部召开橡胶工业会议
    制定橡胶工业生产计划 
    克服盲目生产开辟原料自给道路
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府轻工业部召开的全国橡胶工业会议已制定当前橡胶工业的生产方针和一九五一年的生产计划。会议根据全国橡胶工业的生产能力，主要原料的供应情况和最近一两年内交通、工矿建设及民生日用等方面的需要，决定当前橡胶工业的生产方针是：一般地维持，有重点地整理恢复，避免盲目的扩充，逐步地走向计划生产。会议并决定今后橡胶工业应在国家建设计划的指导之下，有重点有步骤地向汽车轮胎、橡带等生产资料的制造方面发展。
    为了克服盲目生产造成损失，会议根据产销平衡的原则，定出了全国和分区的最低和最高的计划产量。最低数字适用于今年下半年，最高数字则适应于明年内销路可能稍有增加的情况。至于生产的具体数字，则由中央轻工业部机动掌握，及时调整。关于各厂生产数字的分配，会议决定：各地工业主管机关应掌握公私兼顾、奖励进步、照顾历史、照顾全面的精神指导橡胶同业公会进行分配。
    鉴于橡胶工业的原料一向依赖国外供应，会议根据自力更生的原则，研究了开辟国产自给的道路，制定了生橡胶和化学配料方面生产自给的具体办法和步骤。同时也拟定了原材料进口计划和节约的办法，以协助解决目前原料的困难。此次会议集合了公私营厂的技术专家统一规定了橡胶原料、制品的名称、单位和规格标准，以及几种主要制品的原材料消耗标准。会议对于如何改善经营和生产等等，也经过研讨取得了一致的意见。
    会议系于七月十五日至二十七日举行。出席者有各大城市公私营橡胶工业代表、专家和各地工业主管机关、中央人民政府有关部门代表等七十余人。
