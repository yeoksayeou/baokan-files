　　Ministry of Health Decides on Emergency Measures
    Preventing Encephalitis Epidemic in Beijing
    Municipal Public Works Bureau Mobilizes Cleaning Teams to Block Tree Holes
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st] The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government convened a meeting on the 30th to discuss emergency measures to prevent the encephalitis epidemic in Beijing. More than 30 representatives and experts from units such as the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Beijing Working Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Beijing Democratic Women's Federation, relevant bureaus of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, and the Beijing Municipal Health Committee participated in the meeting.
    Premier Zhou Enlai is very concerned about the encephalitis epidemic in Beijing and has given specific instructions. At the meeting, Vice Minister He Cheng of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government conveyed Premier Zhou's instructions. Experts reported on the process of researching the "Aedes mosquito transmitting encephalitis" issue.
    The meeting finally decided on three emergency measures, to be implemented by the Beijing Municipal Health and Public Security authorities: (1) Strengthen publicity to make citizens aware of avoiding mosquito bites; (2) Fill in tree holes to eradicate Aedes mosquitoes; (3) Empty standing water in basins, jars, and other containers in courtyards, and clear standing water in empty vats in sauce shops, dye houses, and other stores. Regularly change the water in domestic water tanks. If citizens discover encephalitis patients, they should immediately report it to the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau and send them to the hospital.
    In other news: The Ministry of Health will send a disease prevention team of more than 300 people to assist the Beijing Municipal Health authorities in implementing the above resolutions.
    [Beijing News Agency] In order to prevent the encephalitis epidemic, the Beijing Municipal Public Works Bureau mobilized 45 mobile cleaning team members from the city to go to the moat around the inner and outer city and the banks of the Jin and Chang Rivers to begin mosquito eradication work a few days ago (August 30). This work mainly involves spraying DDT on more than 4,000 riverside trees with cavities, and then blocking the tree holes with brick ash. All work will be completed today (1st).
    (Note: The encephalitis epidemic period is July, August, and September. Children and young people are more likely to contract this disease, and the mortality rate is very high. Experts have confirmed that it is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes that breed in tree holes and standing rainwater in jars and cans during the rainy season. There is currently no specific treatment, only mosquito eradication and prevention.)

　　卫生部决定紧急办法
    防止京市大脑炎流行         
    卫生工程局动员清洁队堵塞树洞
    【新华社三十一日讯】中央人民政府卫生部为防止京市大脑炎的流行，已于三十日召开会议，商讨紧急措施。会议有军委卫生部、中共北京市委员会、青年团北京市工作委员会、北京市民主妇女联合会、北京市人民政府有关各局、京市卫生委员会等单位代表和专家等共三十余人参加。
    周恩来总理对于北京市大脑炎的流行甚为关切，并曾有具体指示。会议上中央人民政府卫生部贺诚副部长传达了周总理的指示。并由专家们报告了研究“黑斑蚊传染大脑炎”问题的经过。
    会议最后决定三项紧急办法，由京市卫生和公安机关负责执行：（一）加强宣传，使市民注意避免蚊子咬；（二）填死树洞，扑灭黑斑蚊；（三）倾倒院中积水的盆、罐等器皿，清除酱园、染房等商店的空缸积水。太平水缸经常换水。市民如发现大脑炎患者，应立即报告京市公共卫生局并送往医院。
    另息：中央卫生部将派防疫总队三百余人协助京市卫生机关执行上列决议。
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府卫生工程局为了防止大脑炎流行，已于日前（八月三十日）动员全市机动清洁队员四十五人，分赴全市内外城护城河及金、长河沿岸开始扑灭黑斑蚊工作。这次工作主要是对四千余株带有洞穴的河道树，施以ＤＤＴ喷射后，用砖灰将树洞堵塞。全部工作今（一）日即可完成。
    （按：大脑炎流行期为七、八、九三个月，小孩和青年人染此病的较多，死亡率很高；已经专家证实是由一种雨季生长在树洞里和积留雨水的缸罐内繁殖的黑斑蚊所传染，目前还无特效治法，只有灭蚊，预防发生。）
