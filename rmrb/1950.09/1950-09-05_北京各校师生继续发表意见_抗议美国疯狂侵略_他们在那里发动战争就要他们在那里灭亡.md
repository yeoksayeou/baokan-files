Beijing Schools' Teachers and Students Continue to Express Opinions
Protesting American Mad Aggression
Where They Start Wars, They Must Perish!
[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Teachers and students from various schools in Beijing continue to express their opinions, protesting against the American imperialist provocations.

　　　　Jiaotong University Beijing Management Institute
The protest from the Student Union of Jiaotong University's Beijing Management Institute stated: The American imperialist airplanes invaded our Northeast airspace multiple times on August 27th and 29th, committing the gangster crime of killing and injuring our compatriots. This demonstrates that American imperialism is suffering from an extremely insane aggression sickness, daring to stick its pig nose into the territory of our five hundred million people who are united as one. All the students of China Jiaotong University express extreme indignation at this provocative act of American imperialism. In addition to resolutely supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's protest against American imperialism and the two accusations made to the United Nations, we firmly believe that the people of the world who uphold justice will stand with us, so that the imperialist aggression will suffer a complete defeat!

　　　　Central Academy of Fine Arts
The protest letter from the Student Union of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, representing all the students of the academy, said: On August 27th, the American imperialist airplanes boldly invaded the airspace over our sacred Northeast territory and indiscriminately strafed, killing our compatriots. We, the Chinese people, cannot tolerate this mad imperialist act of aggression. The Student Union, representing all students in the factories and on campus, expresses our protest and resolutely supports Foreign Minister Zhou's protest. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we will definitely strengthen unity, study, and struggle to defend the motherland, strive for lasting world peace, and guarantee the fulfillment of all the glorious responsibilities of the Chinese people and Chinese youth.

　　　　People's Revolutionary University
All the students of Class Two, Second Division of the Beijing Xiyuan Revolutionary University signed a protest letter, expressing their determination to treat the signing as a pledge to protest the provocations of American imperialism. The wall posters are filled with articles such as: "Resolutely lean towards the Soviet Union and smash the conspiracies of American imperialism!" "If imperialism wants to start a war there, let them perish there immediately!" "When necessary, we are four hundred and seventy million warriors!"
All the students of Class Two stated: In addition to strengthening the propaganda of the movement to defend peace, everyone should take the positive action of strengthening study and establishing a worldview of serving the people to resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest and just demands to the American government.

　　　　Tsinghua University
The protest letter from the Trade Union of Educational Workers and the Student Union of Tsinghua University stated: "The Chinese people have defeated the aggressive attempts of imperialists more than once. Today, the victorious Chinese people will never fear any aggressive actions of American imperialists." "All our teachers and students warmly support the protest of Foreign Minister Zhou of the Central People's Government and the just struggle of the Soviet representative in the Security Council, and are prepared to respond to any call of the motherland at any time, and fight to defend the motherland and world peace."

　　　　Central Academy of Drama
The protest letter from the Trade Union and Student Union of the Central Academy of Drama stated: "When the American imperialist aggressive troops were suffering heavy losses in Korea and were about to be driven into the sea by the Korean People's Army, they not only showed no remorse but also recklessly expanded their scope of aggression, daring to invade our airspace and strafe our peaceful people and transportation construction, further seriously disrupting world peace. We resolutely protest the crime of American imperialism's armed aggression against China's airspace and territory. The American government must punish the American air force that invaded China's airspace and strafed, must compensate for all losses, and must bear all the serious consequences of this crime."

　　　　Beijing Experimental Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle School
The protest letter from the Student Union, the New Democratic Youth League, and the Trade Union of Educational Workers of the Beijing Experimental Workers' and Peasants' Rapid Middle School stated: "We, the Chinese people who have stood up, will never allow our territory and airspace to be invaded by any imperialists again. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement: demanding that the United Nations Security Council sanction the crime of American aggressor airplanes illegally invading our airspace and killing our compatriots, and ordering the American government to completely withdraw its aggressive troops in Korea."
