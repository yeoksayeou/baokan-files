Fang Zhenliu, the leader of the Hai Liao ship uprising
    His uprising pointed out the path that sailors under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang should take.
    Fang Zhenliu was the captain of the Hai Liao ship. On September 19, 1949, under his instigation and leadership, the Hai Liao ship resolutely broke away from the dark rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, overcame dangers and difficulties, and returned to the embrace of the motherland.
    Fang Zhenliu escaped from Shanghai, which was ruled by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, in 1949, and was forced to sail the Hai Liao ship to Taiwan. At that time, he had seen clearly the brutality and corruption of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and had the motherland in his heart, but he suffered from having no opportunity to seize. Later, the Hai Liao ship was transferred to Hong Kong and was forced to sail to Xiamen for military use. Fang Zhenliu was overjoyed when he received this news and immediately discussed the uprising with several friends. Fang Zhenliu explained to them that he was a member of the Chinese people and should return to the embrace of the people of the motherland and serve the motherland; otherwise, there would be no way out under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and they would inevitably head towards death. They set a plan, and on September 19, 1949, they resolutely sailed the Hai Liao ship out of Hong Kong. On the way to Xiamen, Fang Zhenliu summoned all the crew members to announce the uprising. At that time, some people were still deeply poisoned by the deception and麻醉of the reactionaries. Some still had illusions about the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and opposed the uprising, while others attempted to escape. At this extremely tense and difficult moment, Fang Zhenliu did not consider his personal safety. He painstakingly persuaded and mobilized everyone, exposing the mistakes of having illusions about the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Finally, everyone was moved by his sincerity and realized that only by relying on the people could they have a bright future. He united many forces and overcame all kinds of difficulties before gloriously returning to the embrace of the motherland – the Northeast – across the Pacific Ocean, and was immediately warmly welcomed by the people. His uprising pointed out the path that sailors under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang should take. Soon after, the Hai Xuan ship launched an uprising in Singapore, and all the employees of the China Merchants Bureau in Hong Kong announced their uprising. Many partners who had worked with him were also inspired by his actions and flocked to the motherland.
    Comrade Fang Zhenliu is now the Deputy Director of the Shipping Department of the Dalian Maritime Bureau. The new revolutionary education has inspired his high level of enthusiasm for labor, dedicating his skills to the people and teaching them to others. He often works day and night and never talks about his personal achievements. On the contrary, he often takes the initiative to examine his shortcomings and asks comrades for help. Therefore, his progress is exceptionally rapid. In the great construction cause of the motherland, Comrade Fang Zhenliu is contributing all his strength.

　　海辽轮起义的领导者——方枕流
    他的起义，给蒋匪帮统治下的海员指出了应走的道路。
    方枕流是海辽轮的船长，一九四九年九月十九日，海辽轮在他的策动与领导下，毅然脱离了蒋匪帮的黑暗统治，冲破危险与困难，回到祖国的怀抱。
    方枕流于一九四九年逃出蒋匪所统治的上海，又被迫驾驶海辽轮开往台湾。那时他已看清蒋匪帮的凶残腐败，心怀祖国，但苦于无机可乘。后来海辽轮调到香港，并又逼令开往厦门作军用；方枕流得到这消息喜出望外，即同几个好友商量起义。方枕流向他们说明，自己是中国人民的一分子，应当回到祖国人民的怀抱，为祖国服务；不然，在蒋匪统治下决无出路，必然走向死亡。他们定下了计划，在一九四九年九月十九日，便将海辽轮毅然由港开出，在航往厦门的途中，方枕流召集全体船员宣布起义，当时尚有部分人员因受反动派欺骗、麻醉的毒害较深，有的对蒋匪还有幻想，反对起义，有的企图逃走，在此异常紧张与困难时际，方枕流并未考虑到个人的安危，他苦口婆心向大家说服动员，揭破对蒋匪幻想的错误，最后，大家终于被他的真情所感动，认清只有投靠人民，才是一条光明大道。他团结了许多力量，克服了种种困难，才经过太平洋光荣的回到祖国的怀抱——东北，立即受到了人民热烈的欢迎。他的起义，给在蒋匪帮统治下的海员，指出了应走的道路。不久就有海玄轮在新加坡起义，招商局在香港的全体员工宣布起义，并有不少曾和他一起工作过的伙伴为他的行动所感召，纷纷投向祖国。
    方枕流同志现任大连航务局航运处副处长，新的革命教育启发了他的高度劳动热情，把自己的技术供献给人民，教给别人，他经常不分昼夜的工作，从不谈起个人的功劳；相反的，他经常主动检讨自己的缺点，请求同志帮助，因此他的进步是异常迅速的。在祖国伟大的建设事业中，方枕流同志正贡献出自己所有的力量。
