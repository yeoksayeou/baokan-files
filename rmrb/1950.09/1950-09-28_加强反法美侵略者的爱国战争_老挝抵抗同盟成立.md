　　Strengthening the Patriotic War Against the French and American Aggressors
    Lao Resistance League Established
    [Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 27th Dispatch] The Lao Resistance League was established in early September, with the aim of strengthening the Lao people's patriotic war against French and American aggressors. The League called on the Lao people to cultivate twice as much land as last year, to cultivate nineteen times more highland farmland, to implement the literacy campaign, and to help the People's Liberation Army fight against the enemy's "encirclement and suppression." Laos is located west of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on the left bank of the Mekong River, with an area of more than 89,000 square miles and a population of one million. The Lao people have established their own armed forces and political power, and have been fighting for years against the enslavement of French colonialists and for national liberation.
