　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Following the US House of Representatives' passage of a fascist political persecution bill on August 30th, the US Senate overwhelmingly amended and passed the even more reactionary McCarran Act on September 13th. According to a United Press report, the bill, passed by the Senate with a vote of 70 to 7, not only stipulates, like the House bill, that all "Communists" and so-called "affiliated organization members" must immediately register with the Department of Justice, but also authorizes the government to put them into concentration camps "in the event of war or unrest."

　　Simultaneous with Congress's creation of legislation to suppress democratic parties and groups, according to an Agence France-Presse report, FBI Director Hoover requested a special appropriation from the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 7th to closely monitor all "Communists" so that they could be arrested in one fell swoop at any time. He also revealed that the FBI plans to arrest at least 12,000 "Communists" once the United States launches a major war.

　　In addition, according to TASS: In some US states and cities, overt fascist police rule has been intensified. In Miami, Florida, reactionaries have enacted legislation forcing Communists and "those who follow the Communist line" who stay in the city for more than 48 hours to register and be photographed at the police station. A similar decree has also been issued in Sevierville, Tennessee. Arbitrary arrests of Communists and democrats have also occurred. Police in Pittsburgh closed the local Communist Party headquarters. Police in Oklahoma arrested the local Communist Party secretary.

　　TASS pointed out: "The rampant reaction in the United States has aroused increasing opposition and protest among the broad masses of working people in the country."

　　美参议院通过反动法案
    将加紧法西斯警察统治
    【新华社十四日讯】继美国众院于八月三十日通过法西斯化的政治迫害法案之后，美国参院于九月十三日以压倒多数修正通过为更反动的麦卡伦法案。据合众社消息，参院以七十票对七票通过的这个法案，不但如众院的法案那样规定所有“共产党人”及所谓“附属组织分子”必须立即向司法部登记，并且授权政府在“一旦发生战争或骚动时”，把他们投入集中营。
    与国会制造取缔民主党派团体的立法同时，据法新社消息，美国中央特务机关联邦调查局局长胡佛于七日在参院拨款委员会要求拨出一笔特别费用，以供严密监视所有“共产党分子”之用，以便随时进行一网打尽的逮捕。他并透露该局计划在一旦美国发动大战时，将至少逮捕一万二千名“共产党员”。
    此外，据塔斯社报道：在美国某些州市，公然的法西斯性质的警察统治已见加紧。在佛罗里达州的迈阿密城，反动派制定了一项立法，强制在该城逗留四十八小时以上的共产党员及“遵循共产党路线的人”向警察局登记留影。田纳西州的西维尔维城也定出了类似的法令。专横逮捕共产党人与民主人士的事件也已发生。匹兹堡的警察封闭了当地共产党的总部。俄克拉何马的警察逮捕了当地共产党的书记。
    塔斯社指出：“美国的猖獗的反动，已在国内广大劳动人民中引起日益增涨的反对和抗议”。
