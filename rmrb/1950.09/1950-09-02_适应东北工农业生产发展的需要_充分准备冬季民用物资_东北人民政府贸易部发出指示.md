　　Meeting the Needs of Northeast China's Industrial and Agricultural Production Development
    Fully Preparing Winter Civilian Supplies
    Northeast People's Government Trade Department Issues Instructions
    [Our newspaper, Shenyang News] Correspondent Jin Xin reports: The Northeast People's Government Trade Department recently issued instructions regarding the preparation of civilian supplies for this winter, in order to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production development. The instructions first pointed out: This autumn, the quantity of agricultural products, industrial raw materials, and by-products will greatly increase compared to last year. The overall purchasing power of farmers will increase significantly compared to last year. The broad masses of people's demands for various commodities will increase in terms of variety, quantity, and quality. Therefore, in the planning and distribution of materials, it is necessary to adhere to the principle of considering both public and private interests, to give play to the positive roles of various economic sectors, and to enable various commercial entities to divide labor and cooperate, each fulfilling its role, to promote the smooth flow of exchanges between urban and rural areas. In addition to ensuring the solid preparation of the main materials managed by state-owned trading companies, trade departments at all levels must pay close attention to organizing, leading, and encouraging cooperatives and private businesses to participate in this huge commodity preparation work. If only state-owned trade is taken care of, or if there is an attempt to have state-owned trading companies bear everything, while neglecting to encourage and organize cooperatives and private businesses to participate, it will inevitably affect the supply of commodities to farmers and the sale of agricultural products.

    The instructions also pointed out: In order to do a good job in the planning and distribution of materials this winter, trade departments at all levels must do three things well in their own operations: clarify the scope of commodities managed by state-owned trading companies, accurately study and check supply plans, and establish sound wholesale organizations. State-owned trading companies should only manage the main materials needed by urban and rural people (such as grain, cotton cloth, oil, salt, coal, kerosene, and essential daily necessities). Using all possible conditions, strive to achieve appropriate quantities, suitable quality, reasonable prices, and timely supply. Each specialized district company should, based on the operating plan approved by the Trade Department, send the prepared material names, quantities, times, specifications, and samples (samples can be sent in mid-September) to administrative departments of each province, city, and county, and companies at all levels before the end of August. Starting in September, they should provide a weekly report on the source of materials and distribution status, informing each province and city. Each province and city should, based on the needs of the local people (by county), submit ordering plans. And accurately understand the supply plan of the district company, local production conditions, and the strength of local cooperatives and private businesses to accurately study the supply plan. The relevant provincial and municipal commercial bureaus and relevant district companies (such as the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company) are responsible for actively planning to establish wholesale organizations in central cities such as Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, and Dalian. Strive to start work in September. Formulate organizational charters, work regulations, delineate wholesale areas and units, and draft wholesale contracts, etc., so that after September, wholesale organizations in various localities, under the leadership of the local provincial and municipal bureaus, can convene allocation meetings for receiving wholesale units, and establish various contact systems and procedures.

    The instructions concluded by saying that trade departments at all levels should carefully study how to organize and lead cooperatives and private businesses to serve the people's needs. State-owned trading companies should be responsible for organizing, leading, and encouraging cooperatives and private businesses to operate commodities that are not within their own operating scope. Provincial and municipal commercial bureaus can conduct pilot projects in several key locations, convene symposiums on specialized issues with the participation of various industries and representatives from various fields, clarify the scope of operations, so that various industries have their own operating goals, and procurement, production, and sales plans, and encourage and organize private industrial and commercial enterprises to sign production and sales contracts with each other to meet the requirements of urban and rural economic development. To be more practical, opinions on situation analysis from all parties should be absorbed as much as possible to avoid causing unnecessary losses. Cooperatives should be gradually organized to directly order goods from public and private factories, so that planning is more accurate and commodity additional costs are reduced (by reducing allocation levels). Local state-owned trade agencies, in addition to materials allocated by the district company, can also directly process and order goods from private factories under a unified plan, according to their own needs and strength. However, this should be limited to major commodities. Private businesses should be wholesaled and retailed at reasonable prices in order to lead the market, take care of the same industry, and protect consumer interests, so as to achieve a rational division of labor and common development of various economies.

　　适应东北工农业生产发展的需要
    充分准备冬季民用物资
    东北人民政府贸易部发出指示
    【本报沈阳讯】通讯员晋新报道：东北人民政府贸易部最近发布关于今年冬季民用物资准备工作的指示，以适应工农业生产发展的需要。指示中首先指出：今年秋后农业产品、工业原料、副产品的数量比去年大为增加，农民总的购买力比去年增加很多，广大人民对各种商品的要求，不论在品种、数量、质量等方面均将提高，因此，在物资来源的筹划与分配方面，必须根据公私兼顾的原则，发挥各种经济的积极作用，使各种商业分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个城乡交流的通畅，各级贸易机关除了把国营贸易公司经营的主要物资切实准备好以外，同时必须密切注意，组织领导和鼓励合作社与私商参加这巨大的商品准备工作。如果只照顾国营贸易或企图让国营贸易公司负担一切，而忽视了去鼓励和组织领导合作社与私商来参加，将必然影响对农民商品的供应与农产品的销售。
    该指示又指出：为了作好今冬物资筹划与分配工作，各级贸易机关在本身经营上必须作好三件事，明确国营贸易公司经营商品的范围，准确研究和检查供应计划，建立起妥善的批发组织。各级贸易公司只经营城乡人民需要的主要物资（如粮食、纱布、油、盐、煤、煤油、主要人民日用百货等）。运用一切可能条件，尽量作到数量恰当，质量合适，价格合理，供应及时。各专业区公司应依据贸易部批准的经营计划，于八月底前把准备好的物资品名、数量、时间、规格、样本（样本一项可在九月中）送达各省市县行政部门与各级公司，并自九月份起每旬末作一次检查物资来源与分拨情况的通报，告知各省市，各省市依据当地人民需要情况（分县的）提出订货计划。并准确了解区公司供应计划，地方生产条件，当地合作社和私商力量，来准确研究供应计划。责成有关省市商业厅局和有关区公司（如花纱布公司），积极筹划在沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、大连等中心城市建立起批发组织。争取九月份内能开始工作。制好组织章程，工作条例，划定批发地区单位，批发合同草稿等，求得九月以后，各地批发组织，在当地省市厅局领导下，召开接受批发单位的调拨会议，建立好各种联系制度和手续。
    该指示最后说，各级贸易机关应很好研究，如何组织领导合作社和私人商业供应人民需要服务。各国营贸易公司不属于本身经营范围的商品，应负责的组织领导和鼓励合作社和私商去经营。各省市商业局厅，可在几个重点地方试办，召开有各种行业的，以及有各方面代表参加的专门问题的座谈会，明确划分经营范围，使各种行业各有自己的经营的目标，和采购、生产、销售计划，鼓励和组织私营工商业之间互订产销合同，以适应城乡经济发展的要求。为更符合实际起见，应尽量吸取各方面对情况分析的意见，避免招致不必要的损失。对合作社应逐渐组织其直接向公私工厂订货，以便计划更准确，商品附加费用更降低（因减少调拨层次），各地国营贸易机关。除由区公司调拨之物资外，在统一计划之下，根据本身需要与力量，亦可向私人工厂直接进行加工与订货。但应限于主要商品。对私人商业应以合理的价格进行批发和零售，以领导市场，照顾同业，保障消费者利益，以期各种经济合理分工，共同发展。
