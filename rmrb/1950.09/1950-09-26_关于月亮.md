　　About the Moon
    Mass Astronomy Society
    The Mid-Autumn Festival is here, and many people will be moon gazing. However, in our country, most people still lack scientific knowledge about the moon, and even hold erroneous and superstitious beliefs. Here, we briefly introduce some scientific knowledge about the moon.

  The Moon Seems Brighter During Mid-Autumn Festival
    We often hear this saying, but it is actually just a psychological effect. The moon is the Earth's satellite, orbiting the Earth regularly. Its light is the reflection of sunlight, and it has been like this for billions of years. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, it doesn't particularly approach the Earth, nor is it particularly brighter. In our country, the autumn moon is particularly noticed and appreciated only because of the season. Moon gazing during Mid-Autumn Festival has become a traditional folk custom in our country. We can take this opportunity to explain astronomical principles to people, popularize scientific knowledge, arouse everyone's interest in natural phenomena, and further pursue scientific knowledge.

  The Size and Distance of the Moon
    The moon is spherical, with a diameter of more than 3,400 kilometers. If it fell on the Earth, it would be exactly the size of China. Its volume is one-fiftieth of the Earth's. But why does the moon look so small? This is due to the distance. The moon is 384,000 kilometers away from the Earth, but it is still the closest to us among all celestial bodies!

  When Will the Bright Moon Appear?
    Moonlight comes from the sun. The moon always faces the sun with one side, called the bright side, while the other side is dark. Because it orbits the Earth once a month, the amount of its bright part that we see increases and decreases, thus forming a very regular change in the lunar phases (new moon, full moon, first quarter, last quarter). The moon's rising and setting times also vary every day, with the moon rising approximately fifty minutes later each day. Generally speaking, at the time of the new moon (the beginning and end of the lunar month), the sun and the moon rise and set at the same time, and we cannot see the moon. At the first quarter (around the seventh day of the lunar month), the moon rises at noon and sets at midnight, with its half-bright side facing west. At the full moon (around the fifteenth day of the lunar month), the sun sets when the moon rises, and the moon sets when the sun rises. The situation at the last quarter is exactly the opposite of the first quarter. Many people mistakenly believe that the waxing and waning of the moon are due to the Earth's obstruction, which is incorrect. The full moon closest to the autumnal equinox (September 23rd) is called the Harvest Moon. This year's Mid-Autumn Moon (September 26th) is the Harvest Moon. Although the moon usually rises fifty minutes later each night, in the northern hemisphere in September, the ecliptic (the moon's orbit) and the horizon form the smallest angle, so the moon rises only slightly later each night; this phenomenon is more pronounced the further north you go. Knowing the reasons for the lunar phase changes and the moon's rising and setting times is very helpful for daily life.

  The True Face of the Moon
    Many people say that there is Chang'e dancing, a rabbit grinding medicine, and a cassia tree on the moon... These are all fantasies and superstitions. In fact, astronomers have studied the moon very clearly with telescopes. It is a desolate world filled with mountains (the bright parts on the moon's surface) and plains and deserts (the dark parts on the moon's surface), without air, without water, and with too large a difference between day and night temperatures. Plants and animals cannot survive there. In short, it is a dead world, unsuitable for our habitation.

    If you have the opportunity to go to an astronomical observatory to look at the moon with a telescope (the Public Observatory of the Preparatory Office of the Central People's Science Museum is in Beijing), you can see the moon in detail and gain a lot of scientific knowledge. That is a very meaningful thing.

　　关于月亮
    大众天文社
    中秋节到了，很多人都要赏月。但是在我国，大部分人还缺乏关于月亮的科学知识，甚或存有错误的、迷信的观念。这里，我们简单地介绍一些关于月亮的科学知识。
  月到中秋分外明
    这句话我们常常听到，实际上只是心理作用而已。月亮是地球的卫星，有规则地围绕着地球运行，它的光是太阳光的反射，几万万年以来都是这样。在中秋节它并没有特别接近地球，或者特别光明些。在我国秋月是特别被人注意和欣赏的，那只是季节的关系。中秋赏月已成为我国民间的一种传统的风俗。我们正好趁这机会给人们讲解天象原理，普及科学知识，引起大家对自然现象的兴趣，进而追求科学知识。
  月亮的大小和远近
    月亮是圆球形的，它的直径是三千四百多公里，假如它掉在地球上，就正好和中国一样大。它的体积是地球的五十分之一。但是为什么看起来，月亮只有那么一点大呢？这是由于距离远的关系。月亮距离地球有三十八万四千公里，但它在所有的星体中，还是离我们最近的呢！
  明月几时有？
    月光是从太阳上得来的。它总是以一面对着太阳，叫做亮面，另一面则是黑暗的。因为它绕着地球每月走一圈，所以我们看到它明亮部分的多少就时有增减，这样就形成了很规则的月相（朔望两弦）的变化。月亮的出没时间也每天不一，大约每天的月出要比前一天晚五十分钟。大致说起来，朔时（阴历月初月底）日月同时出没，我们看不见月亮；到了上弦（阴历初七前后），中午月出，夜半月没，它的半个亮面朝西；望时（阴历十五前后），日没月出，月没日出；下弦的情形正好和上弦相反。很多人误以为月圆月缺是由于地球遮蔽，那是错误的。最近秋分（九月二十三日）的望月名叫获月。今年的中秋月（九月二十六日）就是获月。月亮普通每夜东升时间虽然总比前一夜迟五十分钟，但是北半球在九月间，白道（月亮的轨道）和地平线成了最小的角度，所以每夜月出的时间也就不比前一夜迟多少；这种现象越北越显著。知道了月相变化的原因和月亮出没时间，对日常生活是很有帮助的。
  月亮的真面目
    很多人说，月亮上有嫦娥跳舞、兔子捣药，还有桂花树……这些都是幻想和迷信。实际上天文学家用望远镜已经把月亮研究得很清楚了。那上面是充满了山地（月面上明的部分）、平原沙漠（月面上暗的部分）的荒凉世界，没有空气，没有水分，而且昼夜寒暑相差太大，动植物是无法生存的。总之，那是一个死亡的世界，不适合于我们的居住。
    你如果有机会到天文台去用望远镜看月亮（北京有中央人民科学馆筹备处的大众天文台），就可以把月亮看个仔细，得到许多科学知识。那是件很有意义的事。
