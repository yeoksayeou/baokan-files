　　Danish Youth Oppose American Aggression
    Visiting Danish Representative Voit
    Danish representative Voit is a young fighter in the Danish peace movement. He is twenty-three years old this year and is already a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of Denmark, the editor-in-chief of the League's organ publication "Forward," and the editor of the Communist Party's organ newspaper "Land and People" responsible for reporting on the peace movement. These three positions place a significant responsibility on him in the work of the peace movement. His hometown is Avs, and he moved to Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, after the age of six. He joined the revolution at the age of sixteen. At that time, when Nazi bandits ruled Denmark, he and other progressive youths were responsible for sabotage against the enemy. His activities gradually attracted the attention of the Nazi bandits, so he was forced to flee to Sweden. In 1945, Denmark was liberated from the Nazi bandits, and he returned to his motherland and soon joined the Communist Youth League.
    In a conversation with the reporter, he first mentioned that the seven political parties in Denmark each have their own youth organizations, but only the Communist Party's youth organization—the Communist Youth League—is trusted by the vast majority of young people. When talking about the reason for this, he said: When the Danish people were still resisting the Nazi bandits, the general political parties promised the youth various electoral rights and the ability to obtain a good life after the war. However, after liberation, the other six political parties did not fulfill their promises, and even went against them. This made some young people very disappointed, believing that "doing politics" is lying.
    "Of course, this is a biased view." Voit said with emphasis: "Young people should not have this pessimistic mood, and should actively participate in the practical struggle to win happiness for the youth. The Danish Communist Party takes this as one of its directions of effort, and therefore wins the enthusiastic support of progressive youth."
    Voit told reporters that during the Nazi rule, Danish progressive youth made a great contribution to the liberation of the motherland. Denmark has no mountains, and it is very difficult to carry out guerrilla warfare, so progressive youths launched sabotage work on enemy factories and transportation. During the day, they worked as usual, and at night they began various activities. This courageous fighting spirit of Danish youth was actively led and assisted by the Danish Communist Party. The leaders of other political parties actually disagreed from the standpoint of narrow interests, which greatly lost the trust of the young people in their organizations. This is the main reason why the Danish Communist Party was able to widely unite the youth in the struggle against the Nazis.
    "At present, the vast number of progressive youth are throwing themselves into the upsurge of the peace movement, resolutely opposing the North Atlantic Treaty, and are unwilling to be cannon fodder for American and British imperialists." Speaking of this, Voit cited many vivid stories, he said: "Just when the Danish parliament was discussing the North Atlantic Treaty, Danish progressive youth held a grand parade and demonstration in front of the parliament, holding up an eight-meter banner with the words: "Young people say: No!" "Young people don't die for Wall Street!" Five young people were arrested in the parade, but the Danish government did not dare to openly try them, fearing that it would cause greater anger among progressive youth, so they had to release them all. Later, a British Admiral Fraser came to Copenhagen to discuss the North Atlantic Treaty, and he was also fiercely opposed by progressive youth. In this demonstration, nine young people were arrested by military police, one of whom was Ingemann Wagner, chairman of the Communist Youth League. This kind of demonstration against the North Atlantic Treaty has been widely launched throughout Denmark."
    Voit talked about the enthusiastic situation of the peace signature campaign in Denmark, pointing out that it was led by the Danish Democratic Youth League. Before he left Denmark on August 21, more than 122,000 people had signed their names, including about 40,000 young people. This is still incomplete statistics, and the number of signatures is still continuing to rise.
    "Danish progressive youth expressed serious protest against the US imperialist aggression against Korea," Voit said. "The United States, through the United Nations, asked Denmark to send troops, but this request was immediately opposed by the vast number of progressive youth. Under the just demands of the people, the Danish government had to reject the US imperialist request, and only sent a ship of ammunition as a gesture."
    While opposing the US imperialist aggression against Korea, Danish progressive youth unanimously demanded that the government agree to support the representative of New China to attend the United Nations conference. The Democratic Youth League also issued letters calling on young people from all over the world to support the proposal of Stalin and Nehru for the representative of New China to participate in the United Nations. Since the Danish government has established diplomatic relations with New China, not only the Danish Communist Party's organ newspaper expressed its support, but other newspapers also supported this point. Therefore, the Danish Foreign Minister announced that he would allow a vote in the United Nations conference in favor of the representative of New China's participation.
    "Danish progressive youth see the US imperialist aggression very clearly." Voit cited an example: "Not long ago, the US imperialists, under the pretext that an airplane was missing in the Baltic Sea, brought a large number of airplanes, including B-17s, to land at a Danish civil aviation base, and falsely claimed that the planes were not armed, but only came to investigate this incident. The Danish Communist Party's organ newspaper "Land and People" revealed the secret of the US imperialists with facts the next day - the newspaper published a photo proving that the plane was equipped with guns. At that time, the Danish government did not express its opinion, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the vast number of progressive youth, who demonstrated and marched one after another, forcing the American planes to flee in a hurry before the scheduled stay date."
    Finally, Voit enthusiastically told the reporter: "The Danish Communist Party's organ newspaper "Land and People" frequently reports news of New China; Danish progressive youth and people are very excited about the great victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War." When the reporter asked him about his impression of visiting New China, he said without hesitation: "Chinese youth are enthusiastic and happy to work hard to build their own country, which is difficult for a youth from a capitalist country to imagine. Obviously, this is the result of the people turning over and becoming masters." Voit said that after returning to his country this time, he must report the true situation of New China to the Danish people more, so that they know that the Chinese people are a hardworking and courageous nation, and are currently fighting to build their own country and defend world peace!

### 丹麦青年反对美国侵略行为  访问丹麦代表伏伊脱

专栏：世界青联代表访问记

　　丹麦青年反对美国侵略行为
    访问丹麦代表伏伊脱
    丹麦代表伏伊脱，是丹麦争取和平运动中的青年斗士。他今年二十三岁，已经是丹麦共产主义青年团中央委员、团的机关刊物《前进报》主编、共产党机关报《土地与人民报》中负责报道和平运动的编辑。这三个职务，使得他在争取和平运动的工作上，负担着重大的责任。他的故乡是在阿夫斯，六岁以后便迁居到丹京哥本哈根来，十六岁时参加革命。那时正值纳粹匪徒统治丹麦的时候，他和当时的进步青年一同负责对敌人的破坏工作。他的活动逐渐的为纳粹匪徒所注目，因之他被迫逃往瑞典。一九四五年，丹麦从纳粹匪徒手中解放出来，他才重回祖国，不久便加入了共产主义青年团。
    在和记者的谈话中，他首先便谈到：丹麦的七个政党都有各自的青年组织，其中只有共产党的青年组织——共产主义青年团才为广大的青年们所信任。在谈到这个原因时，他说：当丹麦人民还在反抗纳粹匪徒的时候，一般政党都答应青年们在战后将有各种选举权利，能够获得美好的生活。但在解放以后，其他六个政党都不履行他们的诺言，甚至背道而驰。这样，便使一些青年们大失所望，认为“搞政治”就是说谎话。
    “自然，这是一种有偏差的看法。”伏伊脱着重语气的说：“青年们不应当产生这种悲观的情绪，应当积极的参加到为争取青年幸福的实际斗争中去。丹共就是把这点当作努力方向之一的，因此获得进步青年的热烈拥护。”
    伏伊脱告诉记者：在纳粹统治时期，丹麦进步青年对解放祖国的贡献是很大的。丹麦没有山，进行游击战争有很大困难，进步青年们便展开对敌人工厂和交通的破坏工作。日间，他们照常工作，夜间便开始各种活动。丹麦青年这种勇敢的战斗精神，获得丹共的积极领导与协助。其他政党的领袖们竟站在狭隘利益的立场上不赞成，这样便大大的失去了他们组织中青年们的信任。这是反抗纳粹斗争中丹共能够广泛团结青年的主要原因。
    “目前，广大的进步青年正投身在争取和平运动的热潮中，坚决的反对北大西洋公约，不愿作美英帝国主义者的炮灰。”说到这里，伏伊脱举出很多生动的故事，他说：“正当丹麦国会讨论北大西洋公约的时候，丹麦进步青年在国会前举行了盛大的游行示威，高举着八公尺的标语，上面大书：“青年人说：不要！”“青年人不为华尔街送死！”游行中有五个青年被捕，但是丹麦政府不敢公开审判，恐怕引起进步青年更大的愤怒，结果只好都放走了。后来，又有一个英国海军上将佛拉塞到丹京来商讨北大西洋公约的问题，他也同样遭到进步青年们激烈的反对。在这次示威游行中，九位青年被军警捕去，其中一人是共产主义青年团主席英格曼·瓦格纳。像这种反对北大西洋公约的游行示威运动，已经在丹麦各地普遍的展开。”
    伏伊脱谈到和平签名运动在丹麦的热烈情况时，指出这是由丹麦民主青年联盟所领导的，他在八月二十一日离开丹麦前，已有十二万二千以上的人签了名，其中青年有四万人左右。这还是不完整的统计材料，目前，签名的人数仍在继续上涨中。
    “丹麦进步青年对美帝进攻朝鲜表示严重的抗议，”伏伊脱说，“美国通过联合国要求丹麦出兵，这一要求立即遭到广大进步青年的反对，丹麦政府在人民正义的要求下，不得不拒绝美帝的要求，仅仅装送一船军火作为下场。”
    在反对美帝侵略朝鲜运动的同时，丹麦进步青年一致要求政府答应赞成新中国代表出席联合国会议。民主青年联盟并发出函件，号召各地青年支持斯大林、尼赫鲁提出新中国代表参加联合国的建议。由于丹麦政府已与新中国建立邦交，不但丹共机关报表示赞成，其他报纸在这点上也予以支持。因此，丹麦外长宣布，允许在联合国会议投票赞成新中国代表参加。
    “丹麦进步青年对美帝侵略行为看得非常清楚。”伏伊脱举出一个例子说：“不久前，美帝借口有一架飞机在波罗的海失踪，运来大批包括空中堡垒的飞机在丹麦一个民航基地着陆，并伪称飞机上并无武装，只是为了调查这一事件而来。丹共机关报《土地与人民报》在次日便用事实揭发了美帝的秘密——报上刊出一张照片，证实飞机上面装有枪炮。当时，丹麦政府不作表示，这样引起了广大进步青年的不满，纷纷示威游行，使得美国飞机不得不在预定停留时日以前匆匆的逃跑了。”
    最后，伏伊脱热情的告诉记者说：“丹共机关报《土地与人民报》经常的报道新中国的消息；丹麦的进步青年和人民对中国人民解放战争的伟大胜利感到非常的兴奋。”记者问他对在新中国参观的印象时，他毫不迟疑地说：“中国青年热情而愉快的为建设自己的国家而努力，这是一个从资本主义国家出来的青年难以想像得到的。显然，这是人民翻身作了主人的结果。”伏伊脱表示，这次返国后，一定要把新中国的真实情形更多的报道给丹麦人民，使他们知道中国人民是一个勤劳而勇敢的民族，目前正在为建设自己的国家和保卫世界和平而奋斗！（附图片）
