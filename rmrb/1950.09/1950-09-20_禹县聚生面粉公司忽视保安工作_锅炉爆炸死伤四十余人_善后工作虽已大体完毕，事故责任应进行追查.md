　　Yuxian Jusheng Flour Company Neglects Security Work
    Boiler Explosion Kills and Injures Over Forty
    Post-Accident Work Largely Completed, Accident Responsibility Should Be Investigated
    [Report from this newspaper, Xuchang] A major incident occurred on September 1st at the Yuxian public-private joint venture Jusheng Flour Company, involving a boiler explosion that killed and injured over forty workers and nearby residents. The primary cause was the company's administration and technicians neglecting security work, failing to comply with technical regulations, and being careless. In January of this year, the company purchased a used generator at a low price, the large boiler used had a small crack in the second section. To save trouble and money, the company temporarily repaired it and continued to use it. To avoid danger, workers usually only burned it to 80 pounds on the steam gauge before stopping (a good boiler can burn to 120 pounds). On August 30th, steam was again found to be leaking from the old crack. After some minor repairs on the 31st, water was reloaded, and on September 1st, the fire was restarted. At 6 p.m. that day, although the steam gauge indicated 74 pounds, the actual temperature had long exceeded 100 pounds. The furnace workers, due to their short tenure and lack of experience, also failed to detect the problem. Technician Zhang Songting, an hour before the accident, carelessly said, "There's no problem with safety." However, the boiler ultimately could not withstand such significant pressure and exploded at the old crack with a deafening roar, causing the engine room to collapse. A total of ten people from the company were killed or burned to death (including nine workers and one technician surnamed Zhao), three were seriously injured (including the manager), and five were slightly injured. Three nearby residents were crushed to death, two were seriously injured, and twenty-three were slightly injured. Eighteen houses were destroyed, and equipment such as automobiles, wheat filters, wheat stringing machines, stone mills, steel mills, and materials such as wheat and machine oil were lost.

    The occurrence of this major accident was the result of the company leadership's consistent neglect of security work and carelessness. The company manager was an outsider to machinery. He did not understand the non-standard equipment in the factory, such as the large boiler, small chimney, too many bends in the steam pipes, and unsuitable engine installation location. He did not understand it himself, nor did he supervise the technicians to inspect and improve it. Although four malfunctions had occurred successively in recent months, they did not arouse the vigilance of the administrative leadership and technicians. Regarding the use of the machines, technical regulations were not observed. The boiler had only been cleaned three times in four or five months, and the steam gauge had not been cleaned for two months, causing it to malfunction (the original requirement was to clean it every half month), thus leading to the occurrence of this accident.

    After the incident, the county Party, government, and trade union authorities immediately mobilized cadres from various organs, workers from various factories, and nearby residents to carry out emergency rescue. The Provincial Department of Industry, Public Security Department, Labor Bureau, and Federation of Trade Unions all sent people to jointly form a post-accident handling committee to handle all post-accident work. The bodies of the deceased have now been claimed by their families and buried. The coffin costs for the deceased and the medical expenses for the injured are all borne by the company. The families of the affected workers have received temporary relief. The post-accident handling committee will submit its opinions on the issue of compensation for the families of the deceased to the higher authorities for approval based on labor insurance regulations and the company's economic situation. The company's current workers are temporarily receiving one month's salary to maintain their livelihood during the work stoppage (Jiang Hao).

    Editor's Note: Although all post-accident matters have been handled, the People's Government and the People's Supervision Organs should strictly investigate responsibility for such a major accident. Relevant parties should form an inspection team to assist the company in conducting an in-depth inspection of its work, learn lessons from it, study and improve methods, and give due punishment to those who should be held responsible for this incident.

　　禹县聚生面粉公司忽视保安工作
    锅炉爆炸死伤四十余人
    善后工作虽已大体完毕，事故责任应进行追查
    【本报许昌讯】禹县公私合营聚生面粉公司于九月一日发生锅炉爆炸，死伤工人及附近居民四十余名的重大事件。其主因是由于公司行政及技师不重视保安工作，不遵守技术规则，麻痹大意所致。本年一月该公司曾以低价购买旧发电机一部，所用之大锅炉内第二节有一小裂缝。该公司为了省事省钱，经临时修补后即照常使用。为了怕出危险，平时工人只烧到汽表八十磅即停烧（好锅炉能烧到一百二十磅）。八月三十日锅炉旧裂缝处又发现冒气，三十一日稍加修理后即又装上水，九月一日复开始烧火。当日下午六时，汽表虽指在七十四磅上，但实际热度早超过百磅；烧炉工人因工龄短、经验少，也发现不出毛病；技师张松亭在肇事前一小时，还麻痹大意的说：“保险没问题”。但锅炉终因不堪负荷如此重大压力，遂在旧裂缝处爆炸，轰然巨响，机房倒塌。计该公司被炸死烧死十人（内工人九人、赵姓技师一人）、重伤三人（经理在内）、轻伤五人，附近居民被压死三人、重伤二人、轻伤二十三人，烧毁房屋十八间，损失汽车、滤麦机、串麦机、石磨、钢磨等机件及小麦、机油材料等物资。
    这次重大事故的发生，是由于该公司领导上一贯不重视保安工作和麻痹大意的结果。该公司经理对机器是外行，对于厂房中锅炉大、烟筒小、汽管转弯太多、引擎装置地点不妥等设备不合规格之处，自己不懂，又不督促技师检查改进。在近数月内虽曾先后发生四次毛病，但并未引起行政领导及技师的警惕。对机器的使用，则不注意技术规则，锅炉在四、五个月内只洗过三次，汽表已两月未曾洗刷致已失灵（原规定半月洗刷一次），因而酿成此次事故的发生。
    事情发生后，该县党、政、工会当局立即发动各机关干部及各厂工人附近居民等进行紧急抢救。省工业厅、公安厅、劳动局、总工会等均先后派人赶到，共同组成了善后处理委员会，处理一切善后工作。现死难者的尸体均已由家属认领葬埋，死者棺木费、伤者医疗费全由该公司担负，被难工友家属均获临时救济，死者家属抚恤问题亦由善后委员会根据劳保条例及该公司经济实况提出意见呈请上级批准中，该公司现有工人则暂发一个月工资维持停工期间生活（江浩）。
    编者按：对于此次事件的一切善后事宜虽已处理，但如此重大事故，人民政府及人民监察机关应严格追查责任。有关方面应组成检查组，协助该公司深入检查工作，从中接受教训，研究改进办法，并给予应负此次事件责任的人员以应得处分。
