Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, August 28th: The autumn harvest in Henan and Hubei provinces is imminent. Local farmers are now actively purchasing agricultural tools and repairing threshing grounds to prepare for harvesting. Although some areas of the above two provinces suffered from floods, droughts, and insect pests since the summer, the autumn crops in most areas are growing well. The vast rural areas of Henan Province present a scene of bumper harvest. Sorghum is currently being dried, with large and full ears and strong stalks. It is estimated that each mu (approximately 1/6 acre) can yield more than 200 jin (approximately 220 pounds) of grain, and in good areas, it can yield more than 300 jin. Millet has also generally matured, with ears as long as seven or eight inches. Late autumn crops such as beans, cotton, and sweet potatoes are also growing better than last year. Currently, the early autumn crops such as sorghum and millet have begun to be harvested in some areas, with an average yield per mu increasing by one-third compared to last year. In Hubei Province, except for some areas affected by floods, droughts, and insect pests that experienced reduced harvests, the general yields are also around 70-80%. Harvesting will begin in full soon. As the autumn harvest is imminent, local people's governments have begun to organize autumn protection teams with militiamen as the backbone to patrol the fields or cooperate with farmers to build sheds for guarding, in order to prevent sabotage and looting of crops by bad elements. The Henan Military Region Command has also instructed the troops of the entire military region to help farmers with the autumn harvest. Many areas in the two provinces have convened meetings of representatives from all sectors of society and meetings of militia representatives to specifically determine measures for safeguarding the autumn harvest and launch a mass autumn protection movement.

(Report from our newspaper in Mixian, Henan) From Mixian to Xuchang, passing through Xinzheng, Changge, and other counties, across an area of about 200 li (approximately 66 miles), all autumn crops are growing luxuriantly. West of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, corn is the main autumn crop, accounting for more than 60% of all autumn crops; east of the railway, sorghum and millet are the main crops, also accounting for about 60% of the total autumn crop area, with the remainder being beans, sesame, and sweet potatoes. Since the summer, although rainfall has been slightly high, it has been sunny after the rain, with sufficient underground moisture and ample sunshine above ground. In addition, after the peasants were emancipated (most villages have undergone land reform), their enthusiasm for production has been high, and they have engaged in intensive cultivation and fertilization. Therefore, the autumn seedlings are growing rapidly, strong, and lovely. More than half of the wheat stubble corn west of the railway has already sprouted tassels. Farmers report that both early and late corn can achieve good harvests. The sorghum east of the railway has all matured, with tall stalks and plump grains. Harvesting began partially around August 15th, with an average yield of 250 jin per mu. Early millet is also nearing maturity, and the late millet (wheat stubble millet) seedlings are also very fertile, with some about to head. Other beans, sesame, sweet potatoes, cotton, etc., are all growing vigorously. Sesame has formed pods, and cotton is partially beginning to be picked. There is a 70-80% certainty of a general bumper harvest.

(Report from our newspaper in Zhengzhou) New sorghum from Zhengzhou Special District, Henan, has begun to enter the market, and a bumper autumn harvest is expected. In the seven counties of the district, except for more than 30 townships in the areas of Huiguo, Luzhuang, and Jiaowan in Gongxian County, where rain fell later (penetrating rain fell on August 10th), the entire district had penetrating rain around July 4th. Due to the people's government leading the masses in actively planting and cultivating carefully, crops grew exceptionally vigorously. Except for four districts in Chenggao County, three districts in Zheng County, and one district in Mixian County, where some villages and townships were flooded, and three districts in Gongxian County, where partial reductions in production were caused by late rainfall, more than 90% of the entire district is showing signs of a bumper harvest.

(Report from our newspaper in Shishou) All 100,000 mu of early millet in Shishou County, Hubei Province, was completely harvested and threshed by August 15th, with an average yield of 80%, producing about 3 shi (approximately 440 pounds) per mu. All 80,000 mu of glutinous millet has matured, and harvesting began on August 10th and is now nearing completion. Except for some areas where floods, droughts, and insect pests have affected the harvest, causing a reduction of about 20%, most areas have achieved excellent harvests, with an average yield of 4 shi of millet per mu, an increase of 30% compared to previous years. Currently, most of the early millet and glutinous millet fields that have been harvested in the county have already been planted with late autumn crops such as late rice and buckwheat.

　　河南湖北秋收开始
    广大农村一片丰年景色
    【新华社汉口二十八日电】河南、湖北两省秋收在即，当地农民现正积极添购农具，修整场院准备收割。上述两省入夏以来虽有一部分地区遭受水旱虫灾，但大部分地区秋季作物都成长良好。河南省广大农村一片丰年景色，高粱正在晒米，穗大粒实，杆棵茁壮，估计每亩可收粮二百余斤，好的可收三百斤以上。谷子也已普遍成熟，谷穗长达七八寸。晚秋作物如豆子、棉花、红薯等亦均比去年长得好，现部分地区的高粱、谷子等早秋作物已开始收割，平均每亩产量较去年增加三分之一。湖北省除部分水、旱、虫灾区歉收外，一般年景也都在七八成左右，不久即可全部开镰。由于收秋在即，各地人民政府为防止坏分子破坏和抢劫庄稼，已开始组织以民兵为骨干的护秋队，下地巡逻，或配合农民搭棚看守。河南军区司令部更指令全军区部队帮助农民秋收。两省不少地区曾召开各界代表会议及民兵代表会议，具体确定了保卫秋收的办法，展开群众性的护秋运动。
    【本报河南密县讯】从密县到许昌，经过新郑、长葛等县，约二百里的地带，所有秋禾均生长丰茂。京汉铁路以西，以玉茭为主要秋季作物，约占全部秋禾百分之六十以上；路东以高粱、谷子为主，亦约占全部秋禾面积的百分之六十以上，其余为豆类、芝麻及红薯等。今夏以来，虽雨量稍大，但雨后即晴，地下水分充裕，地上阳光充足；兼以农民翻身后（大部乡村经过土改），生产情绪高涨，精耕细作，加工施肥，因此秋苗均生长迅速，肥壮可爱。路西麦茬玉茭半数以上亦已出顶穗。农民反映：不论早晚玉茭，均可获得良好收成。路东的高粱已全部成熟、杆高籽肥，八月十五日左右即已部分开始收割，每亩平均有二百五十斤的收成。早谷亦已接近成熟，晚谷（麦茬谷）苗儿亦甚肥嫩，有的即将吐穗。其他豆类、芝麻、红薯、棉花等均生长茁壮。芝麻已结荚，棉花部分开始收摘，普遍丰收已有七八分把握。

    【本报郑州讯】河南郑州专区新高粱开始上市，秋季丰收可望。该专区七个县，除巩县回郭、鲁庄及焦湾等区共三十余乡落雨较晚（八月十日落透雨）外，全区均于七月四日前后普落透雨。由于人民政府领导群众积极抢种，加工细作，庄稼生长异常茂盛。全区除成皋县四个区、郑县三个区，密县一个区部分村乡遭受水淹，巩县三个区因落雨较晚部分减产外，占全区百分之九十以上的地区，普呈丰收景象。

    【本报石首讯】湖北省石首县十万亩早谷，至八月十五日已全部割完登场，平均八成年景，每亩产三石左右。八万亩糜谷均已成熟，八月十日开始收割，现已接近结束。除若干地区因水、旱、虫灾影响歉收约百分之二十外，大部地区收成极佳，每亩平均产谷四石，较往年产量增加百分之三十。现该县已收割之早谷和糜谷田，大部分已播种晚稻和荞麦等晚秋作物。
