Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 19th: The Security Council reconvened on September 18 to examine the issue of the United States' invasion of Taiwan (Formosa). On this issue, the Security Council has before it a Soviet proposal. The proposal condemns the United States for aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs, and demands that the United States immediately withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan (Formosa) and other territories belonging to China. However, the President of the Security Council, British Representative Jebb, attempted to postpone the deliberation of the issue of the invasion of Taiwan (Formosa), and requested that the "accusation of aggression against the Republic of Korea" be adopted as the first provisional agenda item. The first proposal intended to allow the U.S. delegation to read General MacArthur's report, which insisted that the Soviet Union was supplying weapons to the Korean People's Army. In response to Malik's questioning, Jebb was forced to admit that MacArthur's document was only distributed to the members of the Security Council after they had entered the meeting room. Malik pointed out that he could not discuss a document he had just received. Malik pointed out that MacArthur's report was extremely lengthy, and that representatives should have the opportunity to study the document before the Security Council deliberated and discussed it.

The U.S. Representative, Austin, said that if the Security Council adopted the proposed agenda, the U.S. delegation would only read the report and would not request a discussion of it. Jebb supported this attitude, which was clearly intended to delay the deliberation of the issue of the invasion of Taiwan, giving the U.S. the opportunity to release a propaganda smokescreen to divert people's attention from U.S. aggression. However, Malik again strongly opposed this trick. He reiterated that the full text of MacArthur's report was only delivered to the representatives on September 18. He said that when the document was presented, the Security Council must study it before deliberating it. Speaking of Austin and Jebb's claim that they only wanted the Security Council to "receive" MacArthur's report, Malik said: The Soviet Union cannot agree to receive a document it is not familiar with. He also pointed out that MacArthur's report has not yet been translated into Russian and other official languages ​​of the United Nations. At the very least, the presentation of this issue is inappropriate and premature. Malik concluded by saying: The Soviet Union opposes placing this item on the agenda.

The French representative, Chauvel, and the Kuomintang representative, Jiang Tingfu, spoke in favor of reading MacArthur's report.

Jebb suggested that the Security Council should agree to have the U.S. representative read MacArthur's report. Malik repeated to Chauvel that he could not agree to receive a document he had not read. Malik pointed out: Jebb originally stated that the purpose of including the first item on the agenda was to enable the Security Council to receive the report, but Jebb now claims that his purpose is only to read MacArthur's report. Malik bluntly asked: Why read this report? -- Is it just to vibrate the waves of the air? Or is this report being presented so that the Security Council can receive it? But how can the representatives of the Security Council member states do this when they have not even read the report? Malik pointed out that he had asked the President to have the report translated into Russian, and said: The French representative may not want the report translated into French, but on the other hand, some Spanish-speaking countries may be willing to translate the document into their languages. Malik finally said that if the procedure commonly used by the Security Council of translating documents and distributing them to the members for study is abandoned simply because the U.S. representative wants to do so, and a hasty reading method is adopted instead, this may create the impression that the report is being presented to divert the Security Council's attention from the current issue, thereby preventing deliberation of the issue of armed invasion of Taiwan.

Quito of Ecuador supported the U.S. trick of diverting attention. Austin and Chauvel made various excuses to include MacArthur's report on today's agenda, but Malik continued to oppose this trick of delaying the deliberation of the issue of U.S. aggression against Taiwan. Jebb then requested a vote on whether to adopt the provisional agenda. At this time, Egyptian representative Fawzi made a proposal to postpone the deliberation of the issue of the invasion of Taiwan (Formosa). He suggested that the Security Council should discuss the Egyptian accusation of the expulsion of one thousand Palestinian Arabs into Egyptian territory and Israel's violation of the Egyptian-Israeli armistice agreement before discussing the Taiwan issue.

Malik opposed delaying the discussion of the issue of the invasion of Taiwan. The Soviet delegation believes that it is fair and in accordance with procedural rules for the Security Council to conduct a discussion of the Taiwan issue. Malik pointed out that the Soviet delegation has already suggested that the representatives of the People's Republic of China should be invited to participate in the discussion of the Taiwan issue. He said that the Security Council should discuss this matter. Jebb again requested a vote on whether to adopt the proposed agenda. But Malik pointed out that there was no need to vote on whether to include the Taiwan and Palestine issues on the agenda, because no one opposed their inclusion. He suggested that the Security Council should only vote on the issue of whether to include MacArthur's report, because there was opposition to this issue.

After a brief discussion on this procedural issue, Jebb requested a vote on whether the so-called Korean issue—MacArthur's report—should be included on the Security Council's agenda. The U.S. voting machine then started up and decided to include MacArthur's report on the agenda. The Soviet representative opposed this proposal to delay the deliberation of the Taiwan issue, and the other ten members of the Security Council supported this proposal. After the agenda was adopted, Jebb immediately invited Syngman Rhee's representative, Chang Myon, to take a seat.

American Representative Reads MacArthur's Report Attempting to Cover Up Crimes of Aggression Against Korea
Malik then reminded Jebb that throughout the previous discussion, the Soviet delegation had suggested that the Security Council should first discuss the Taiwan issue, because the Soviet delegation had raised the issue of inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the meeting at the end of the last meeting. Jebb replied that the Security Council had adopted Jebb's opinion of listing the Korean issue as the first item on the agenda by adopting the agenda with the Korean issue. Malik immediately exposed Jebb's conspiracy. He pointed out that the Soviet delegation suggested that the Security Council should first decide on the agenda, and then decide on the order of discussion. He pointed out that Jebb did not state that the order of discussion was also included when putting the agenda to a vote. Therefore, Malik finally said: The Soviet delegation suggests that the Security Council should first discuss the Taiwan issue. Jebb then ruled that the Security Council's adoption of the agenda also meant adopting the order of the items on the agenda. However, Malik pointed out that the Soviet delegation had suggested that the Security Council first discuss the issue of the invasion of Taiwan before Jebb made his ruling.

But Jebb insisted on his ruling, so he invited U.S. Representative Austin to read MacArthur's report. MacArthur's report described the development of the Korean War from August 16 to 31, insisting that the Soviet Union was supplying the Korean People's Army with Soviet war materials. MacArthur also attempted to deny that the troops under his command were engaged in a brutal war of destroying Korean cities and people. The report also accused the People's Republic of China of sending "a large number of combat-hardened troops of Korean origin." MacArthur's report attempted to defend the U.S. Air Force's barbaric attacks on defenseless Korean civilians, and blamed the atrocities on the North Korean army. Regarding the food situation in the areas controlled by MacArthur's headquarters, the report stated that the existing reserves were insufficient to supply civilians with even the minimum food needs even after mid-September. The report summarized the military developments.

After the report was translated into French, Jebb invited Ecuadorian Representative Quevedo to speak. Quevedo claimed that he wanted to discuss the report, but said that given the lateness of the hour, he proposed a recess.

So, Chairman Jebb immediately seized on Quevedo's proposal, eager to achieve the purpose of adjourning the meeting, attempting to have the Security Council hastily vote on the suggestion to adjourn.

However, Malik requested to speak according to the rules of procedure, thereby exposing this trick. Malik said that because the document read by Austin contained slander against the Soviet Union, he wanted to speak on the facts, regardless of the procedural tricks used by the U.S. bloc to prevent him from speaking. However, Jebb attempted to prevent further discussion, claiming that if Malik made a statement, other representatives might also want to speak. Jebb stated that the Security Council must decide whether to hear Malik's speech or adjourn the meeting, and emphasized that the motion to adjourn should be voted on first.

Quevedo expressed his willingness to postpone the vote on his proposed motion to adjourn.

Malik Speaks to Expose the Nature of U.S. Aggression Against Korea, Accuses U.S. Representatives of Playing Tricks to Confuse the Public
Then, Malik made a lengthy speech, exposing the U.S. aggression against Korea and the attempts of U.S. imperialists to divert people's attention from this aggression. He said: The U.S. representative read MacArthur's lengthy report on U.S. aggression against Korea, and prevented the deliberation of the Taiwan issue and the issue of inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China. He pointed out: This is not the first time the U.S. delegation has played this trick; he cited the situation at previous Security Council meetings, where the U.S. delegation had put forward proposals to prevent the Security Council from deliberating the Soviet proposal for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue. He declared that the purpose of the U.S. playing this trick is to prevent the Security Council from deliberating on certain issues, and to divert people's attention from U.S. aggression against China.

Malik then said: MacArthur's report is clearly a document aimed at confusing the public. He recalled that the Soviet delegation had exposed the nature of U.S. aggression against Korea a long time ago.

Malik cited the documents of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea describing the U.S.'s barbaric bombing of Korea, pointing out that the Security Council had not taken any action to stop this bombing. He said: The U.S. imperialism, enraged by its defeat on the front lines, is destroying the peaceful residents and industries of Korea. He cited many pieces of evidence proving that U.S. bombers had attacked peaceful towns and villages.

Malik continued: A large part of the national wealth of Korea has been destroyed by U.S. bombing. He said: In order to increase the extent of the destruction, the United States has used specially designed time bombs, which explode when the people come out of hiding to rescue the injured. All of these are acts of rudely violating accepted standards of international law. The crimes of the U.S. Air Force in Korea prove that U.S. imperialism unscrupulously uses the most despicable and barbaric means to achieve its goals.

Malik then referred to the telegram issued by Pak Hon-yong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on September 16, strongly protesting the bombing by U.S. aircraft of a clearly marked hospital building in the center of Pyongyang, emphasizing: These documents expose the lies in MacArthur's report to the Security Council. Malik then quoted the account of the reporter of the Paris newspaper Le Monde about the unspeakable terror suffered by 300,000 Korean people, who were driven by the Americans into a valley and abandoned there, without shelter or food, left to starve to death. Malik mentioned a Reuters report that Attlee had said in reply to Churchill that the Korean War was being conducted by the United States. Malik said that the Americans should be responsible for the war commanded by MacArthur. Regarding MacArthur's report's claim that the Soviet Union supplied weapons to North Koreans, Malik said: It is necessary to repeat his statement made on August 11 that the existing weapons of North Korea were sold to the North Korean government by the Soviet Union during the withdrawal of Soviet troops in December 1948. Jebb immediately suggested that the meeting be adjourned immediately, proposing that Malik's statement be translated into English and French at the next meeting.

Malik proposed that it be translated into English now, but the Security Council rejected this proposal. Only Malik voted in favor, with six votes against and four abstentions. Jebb asked the Security Council to give him the power to decide when to convene the Security Council again. After Jebb assured Malik that the next meeting would not be delayed for too long, the Security Council adjourned.

　　安理会十八日会议上
    苏代表坚持讨论美国侵台问题
    美英代表无理拖延讨论，转移对美国侵略的注意
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约十九日电：安理会于九月十八日复会，审议美国侵犯台湾（福摩萨）问题。在这一问题上，摆在安理会面前的有苏联的提案。该提案谴责美国侵略中国和干涉中国内政，并要求美国立即从台湾（福摩萨）和其他属于中国的领土撤退其全部武装部队。但安理会主席英国代表杰伯却企图推延侵犯台湾（福摩萨）问题的审议，而要求通过以“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”作为第一项临时议程，第一提案打算允许美国代表团宣读麦克阿瑟将军硬说苏联以武器供给朝鲜人民军的报告。在回答马立克的质问时，杰伯被迫承认麦克阿瑟的文件在安理会各理事进入会议室后才分发给他们。马立克指出，他无法讨论他刚收到的文件。马立克指出：麦克阿瑟的报告极为冗长，在安理会审议和讨论这一文件前，代表们应有机会将文件加以研究。
    美国代表奥斯汀说，如果安理会通过所建议的议程，美国代表团将仅仅宣读报告，而不请求讨论报告。杰伯支持这一态度，这种态度显然是想推延侵略台湾问题的审议，使美国有机会放出宣传烟幕，转移人民对于美国侵略的注意。但是，马立克又强有力地反对这种花样。他再度指出，麦克阿瑟报告的全文在九月十八日才送达各位代表。他说，当文件提出时，安理会在审议报告前必须先加以研究。谈到奥斯汀与杰伯所谓他们只希望安理会“受理”麦克阿瑟的报告的说法时，马立克说：苏联不能同意受理它所不熟悉的文件。他又指出，麦克阿瑟报告尚未译成俄文和联合国的其他正式语言。至少，这个问题的提出是不合时宜和为时过早的。马立克在结语中说：苏联反对将这一项目列入日程。
    法国代表萧维尔和国民党代表蒋延黻发言赞成宣读麦克阿瑟的报告。
    杰伯建议安理会应同意由美国代表宣读麦克阿瑟的报告。马立克在回答萧维尔时重复地说，他不能同意受理他未曾读过的文件。马立克指出：杰伯原先表示，将第一个项目列入议程，目的是要使安理会能够受理这个报告，但杰伯现在却声称，他的目的不过是把麦克阿瑟的报告宣读一下。马立克直截了当地问道：为什么要宣读这个报告呢？——难道只是为了要振动一下空气的波浪吗？还是把这个报告提出来以便安理会能受理它呢？但是，安理会各理事国代表们连读也没有读过这个报告，如何能这样做呢？马立克指出他曾要求主席把这个报告译成俄文，并说：法国代表或者不希望把这个报告译成法文，但另一方面，若干西班牙语国家可能愿意把这个文件译成它们的语文。马立克最后说，如果只是因为美国代表希望这样做便把安理会所惯用的将文件译出分发各理事研究的程序弃置不用，而改用匆匆宣读的办法的话，这可能造成一种印象，以为这个报告的提出是为了要转移安理会对当前问题的注意力，从而阻止审议武装侵略台湾问题。
    厄瓜多尔的奎维铎支持美国的这种转移注意力的花样。奥斯汀和萧维尔又提出各种借口，要把麦克阿瑟的报告列入今天的议事日程中，但马立克继续反对这种推延美国侵略台湾问题之审议的花样。杰伯继即要求投票表决是否通过临时议程。这时埃及代表法齐提出关于延缓审议侵略台湾（福摩萨）问题的建议。他建议：安理会在进行讨论台湾问题之前先讨论埃及控诉把一千名巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人驱入埃及领土及以色列违反埃及——以色列停战协定案。
    马立克反对延缓讨论侵略台湾问题。苏联代表团认为，安理会进行台湾问题的讨论是公正的且符合程序规则的。马立克指出，苏联代表团已经建议在讨论台湾问题时要邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加。他说，安理会应该讨论这件事情。杰伯又要求投票表决是否通过所提出的议程。但马立克指出，没有必要投票表决是否把台湾和巴勒斯坦问题列入议程中，因为无人反对把它们列入。他建议安理会只应表决是否把麦克阿瑟的报告列入的问题，因为在这一问题上有人提出反对。
    在对这一程序问题稍事讨论之后，杰伯要求投票表决是否应把所谓朝鲜问题——麦克阿瑟的报告——列入安理会议程的问题。美国的表决机器便开动起来，决定将麦克阿瑟的报告列入议程。苏联代表反对这一推延审议台湾问题的提案，其他十位安理会理事赞成这一建议案。通过议程后，杰伯即请李承晚的代表张勉入席。
    美代表宣读麦克阿瑟报告  企图掩饰侵略朝鲜的罪行
    马立克继即提醒杰伯说，在以前的整个讨论中，苏联代表团便已建议安理会应首先讨论台湾问题，因为在上次会议结束时苏联代表团便提出了邀请中国人民政府代表出席会议的问题。杰伯回答说：安理会通过把朝鲜问题列入议程即是通过了杰伯所提的，把朝鲜问题列为议程第一项的意见。马立克当即揭破杰伯的阴谋。他指出：苏联代表团建议安理会先决定议程，然后再决定讨论的次序。他指出：杰伯在把议程付表决时并未说明其中也包含讨论次序的问题。因此，马立克最后说：苏联代表团建议安理会先讨论台湾问题。杰伯继即裁决称：安理会通过议程也就是通过了议程上各项目的次序。但是，马立克指出：在杰伯行使裁决前，苏联代表团曾建议安理会首先讨论侵略台湾的问题。
    但杰伯坚持他的裁决，于是便请美国代表奥斯汀宣读麦克阿瑟的报告。麦克阿瑟的报告述及自八月十六日至三十一日这一时期朝鲜事件的发展，硬说苏联以苏联的战争物资供给朝鲜人民军。麦克阿瑟并企图否认他所指挥的部队在从事毁灭朝鲜城市与人民的野蛮战争。报告并指责中华人民共和国送出“大批原籍朝鲜的久经战斗的军队”。麦克阿瑟的报告企图辩护美国空军野蛮袭击赤手空拳的朝鲜平民，把暴行诿之于北朝鲜军队。关于麦克阿瑟司令部控制下的区域的粮食情况，报告声言现有的存储量甚至在九月中旬以后即不足以供应平民最低限度的粮食需要。报告综述军事发展的情况。
    在报告用法文翻译之后，杰伯请厄瓜多尔代表奎铎锌发言。奎维铎声称他希望讨论这份报告，然而又说，鉴于时间不早，他提议休会。
    于是，主席杰伯立刻抓住奎维铎的提议，急于达到休会的目的，企图使安理会匆匆表决休会的建议。
    然而，马立克要求据议事规则发言，从而揭破了这个诡计。马立克说，因为奥斯汀所宣读的文件含有对苏联的诽谤，因此他希望就事实真相发言，而不管美国集团用程序上的花样来阻止他发言。但是，杰伯企图阻止进一步的讨论，声言如果马立克发表声明，其他代表可能也希望发言。杰伯声言，安理会必须决定是否听取马立克发言或者休会，并且强调休会的动议应尽先表决。
    奎维铎表示愿意延缓表决他所提出的休会的动议。
    马立克发言揭露美国侵朝性质  指斥美代表玩弄花样混淆听闻
    接着，马立克作长篇发言，揭露美国对朝鲜的侵略行为和美国帝国主义分子企图转移人们对这一侵略行为的注意力。他说：美国代表宣读了麦克阿瑟关于美国侵略朝鲜的冗长报告，并且阻止了审议台湾问题和邀请中华人民共和国代表的问题。他指出：美国代表团玩弄这种花样，并不是第一次；他引证安理会前几次会议的情形，在那些会议上，美国代表团曾提出一些提案，借以阻止安理会审议苏联所提关于和平解决朝鲜问题的提案。他宣称：美国玩弄这种花样的目的，在于不让安理会审议某些问题，和转移人们对美国侵略中国的注意力。
    马立克接着说：麦克阿瑟的报告显然是一个旨在混淆视听的文件。他追述苏联代表团很早以前就揭露了美国对朝鲜的侵略的性质。
    马立克引证朝鲜民主主义人民共和国叙述美国野蛮轰炸朝鲜的情形的文件，指出：安全理事会一直没有采取任何行动来制止这种轰炸。他说：美帝国主义在前线遭受失败，恼羞成怒之下，便毁灭朝鲜的和平居民和工业。他引证了许多证据，证明美国轰炸机曾袭击和平的城镇和乡村。
    马立克继续说：朝鲜的国民财富的一大部分已被美国的轰炸所毁灭。他说：为了增加破坏的程度，美国曾使用专门设计的定时炸弹，正当老百姓从隐蔽处出来救护受伤的人时，这种炸弹就爆炸起来。所有这些都是粗暴地破坏公认的国际法标准的行为。美国空军在朝鲜的罪行，证明美帝肆无忌惮地使用最卑鄙和最野蛮的手段来达到他们的目的。
    马立克于是提到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永于九月十六日所发出的强烈抗议美国飞机轰炸平壤市中心区有显明标帜的医院建筑的电文，他强调：这些文件揭露了麦克阿瑟致安理会报告中的谎言。马立克于是援引巴黎报纸世界报记者关于三十万朝鲜人民所遭受的不可言状的恐怖的叙述，他们被美国人驱逐到一个山谷里并被遗弃在那里，既没有住处也没有食物，任其饿死。马立克提到路透社消息说，艾德礼在答复邱吉尔时曾说朝鲜战争是由美国进行的。马立克说，美国人应对麦克阿瑟所指挥的战事负责。关于麦克阿瑟报告中硬说苏联以武器供给北朝鲜人一节，马立克说：把他在八月十一日所作的声明再说一遍是有必要的，北朝鲜现有的武器是苏联在一九四八年十二月苏军撤退期间卖给北朝鲜政府的。杰伯当即建议立即休会，提议到下次会议时再把马立克的声明再用英文与法文。
    马立克提议现在就用英文翻译，但安理会否决了这个提议。仅仅马立克投票赞成，六票反对，四票弃权。杰伯要求安理会给他以斟酌何时再召集安理会的权力。在杰伯向马立克保证下次会议不致延迟得太久之后，安理会即休会。
