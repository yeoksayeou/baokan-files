　　The One-Armed Demolition Hero, Chai Xuejiu
　　Xia Yang
(1)	His Right Arm Was Blown Off
　　In the early stages of the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War, our army lacked heavy weapons, and engineering demolition often played an important role in siege battles. Countless engineering demolition heroes emerged in the battles.
　　Comrade Chai Xuejiu, the engineering battalion commander of a certain unit of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, is one such outstanding demolition hero. In the past thirteen years, he has created various firearms and trained nearly two thousand engineers. In the past battles, he was wounded seven times, credited twenty-seven times, received two "People's Hero" medals, received three commendations, and won the honorary title of "One-Armed Demolition Hero."
　　He was born in Xizhi Village, Xingtai, Hebei. His family was poor, and his parents died early. As a child, he herded cattle and cut grass. In 1938, when he was seventeen years old, he joined the Eighth Route Army Jixi Guerrilla, which was active in his hometown. He went in and out of the enemy's rear, training militias to launch widespread landmine warfare against the enemy. In 1940, he joined the Communist Party of China.
　　In July 1942, after graduating from the eighth phase of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, he participated in the Taihang Military Region Engineering Team for study. In October of the same year, he led the militia in the Xuting area of Zanhuang to fight the Japanese and puppet troops in the border area. While explaining the structure and performance of hand grenades to the militia, he was unfortunately injured in six or seven places when unloading a detonator, and his right arm was blown off.
(2)	The Enemy Would Not Surrender; He Blew Them Up in the Bunker
　　In August 1945, the autumn dew fell in the North Henan Plain, and our army launched a full-scale counteroffensive. The Taihang troops marched day and night to North Henan. Chai Xuejiu's engineering company (at this time, he was already the deputy company commander, and soon after, he became the company commander) coordinated with the infantry to capture Qinghua City in one fell swoop, annihilating more than 1,300 puppet troops. In the end, only one squadron of more than 120 Japanese troops remained in the large bunker in the northwest corner of the city. At that time, our army had no artillery. Seeing the large bunker twenty meters away, it could not be taken down for a day and a night. The enemy stubbornly resisted and constantly counterattacked us. Just when the situation was critical, he organized a demolition squad, approached the bunker, installed explosives, and personally lit the fuse, but only blew a hole in it. He turned pale with anger, picked up ten kilograms of explosives with one hand, and rushed forward. The enemy's machine guns fired continuously, but he did not flinch. A loud bang was heard, and another opening was blown in the bunker. The enemy was a little panicked, but still refused to surrender. He immediately found a way to create a kind of explosive package, took the engineers, climbed to the roof of a nearby house, and threw more than a dozen of them into the bunker. At the same time, he threw dry firewood into the bunker's exit and set it on fire, while continuing to throw grenades, blowing up or burning all the enemies inside.
(3)	Demonstrated the High Creativity and Self-Sacrificing Spirit of the People's Army
　　In the Battle of Jiaozuo in northern Henan, Comrade Chai Xuejiu demonstrated the high creativity and self-sacrificing spirit of the people's army.
　　Jiaozuo was a modern fortified city. The outermost layer was a dense bunker complex, the second layer was an electric fence, the third layer was an outer moat, and the fourth layer was an outer wall. Outside the electric fence were densely arranged electric mines, and between the electric fence and the outer moat, as well as on the outer wall, there was a searchlight every hundred meters. At that time, our army had shifted from guerrilla warfare to siege warfare. In addition to mortars, there were no heavier firearms. Most of the cadres and soldiers were still unfamiliar with electric fences and searchlights. Chai Xuejiu also secretly felt that it was difficult to start. However, blowing up the electric fence was the key to taking Jiaozuo. He went to the newly liberated Xida Well Factory in Jiaozuo while ill to study ways to destroy the electric fence. He initially asked a person wearing rubber clothes and rubber gloves to cut the electrified barbed wire with a guillotine wrapped in rubber on the wooden handle. As soon as the knife was cut down, sparks flew everywhere, spewing out a foot or two of flames, but the electric fence was not damaged at all, and the guillotine was sometimes sucked by the electric fence. After a week of careful research and experimentation, he created a very powerful explosive tube and also created a small grappling hook detector. He personally demonstrated it to the troops and explained the principle of the electric fence, dispelling everyone's ideological concerns.
　　The order to attack the city came down.
　　Chai Xuejiu was assigned the task of blowing up the electric fence. He was suffering from malaria, his face was pale, and his body was very weak. But he bravely accepted the task.
　　In the early autumn weather, the sorghum and corn were taller than people. The three of them, he, a communicator, and a soldier, crawled forward in the open farmland. The explosive tube often bumped into the crops, making a rustling sound. The searchlights crisscrossed and swept across, and the strong light made his eyes blurry. Soon, they crawled to the edge of the field. Passing through the twenty-meter-wide open area in front would lead to the electric fence. But in this area, completely exposed under the enemy's intersecting fire and the glare of the searchlights, it was not easy to pass. He hesitated slightly, made a gesture to the communicator and the soldier behind him, and rushed to the electric fence with everything he had. Before the explosives were completely buried, the enemy's machine guns had already started firing, and bullets were burrowing into the soil with a swishing sound beside their feet. They quickly connected the long fuse of the electric igniter and desperately ran back, hiding behind a soil ridge, waiting for the signal to attack. Suddenly, the first signal rose, but a serious question entered his mind: what if the explosive tube didn't explode when the second signal rose? There was no doubt that if the electric igniter didn't explode, he would immediately rush up and blow it up, but he would most likely die with it! At this time, the communicator next to him also thought of the same question and asked him worriedly, "Deputy Company Commander! What if it doesn't go off?" He immediately replied in a serious tone: "If it doesn't go off, we will rush up and blow it up!"
(4)	Using Chai Xuejiu's Explosion as the Signal for the Entire Line to Break Through
　　In March 1947, in order to contain the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's New Third Division in Jiaozuo and directly cooperate with the North Henan Campaign to annihilate Sun Dianying's bandit troops, our army had to blow up the large and small bridges between Jiaozuo and Xiuwu overnight. The battle-tested one-armed hero once again undertook the arduous task of blowing up the largest nine-arch bridge west of Xiuwu City, using the explosion of the nine-arch bridge as the signal for the entire line to break through simultaneously.
　　Not long after dark, he and four engineers set off with eighty kilograms of explosives. Crossing the rice fields, they reached the enemy's road protection blockade line, and they had to proceed with extra caution. After passing the blockade line, they vaguely saw the nine-arch bridge and the bridgehead bunkers at both ends. They quickly went down to the river and, using the slope of the riverbank, concealed themselves to observe the terrain and the enemy's movements. He thought: the bridgeheads are at both ends of the bridge, and it is impossible to go up to the bridge deck to blow it up. If they were discovered, the sacrifice would be a small matter, but the task would not be completed. If they blew it up from under the bridge, it would not work because the bridge seat was very high, and blowing up the bridge foot could not completely break the bridge either. So he followed the riverbank, approached the iron bridge, then went down into the river, wading through knee-deep water, and moved towards the two bridge seats in the middle. The riverbed stones were very slippery, and he would fall if he was not careful. He finally reached the bridge foot, immediately climbed up the two bridge seats, placed the explosives at the junction of the bridge frame and the bridge seat, then lit the fuse and jumped down to run. By the time the enemy discovered them and launched a crossfire at them, the nine-arch bridge had already been blown into several sections with a "boom" in the middle. Then more than thirty bridges on the Daqing Line were blown up overnight.
　　Chai Xuejiu returned with a victorious smile. There were five of them when they left, and there were still five of them when they returned.
(5)	One Arm Was Broken, and Three or Four Thousand Arms Stretched Out
　　Comrade Chai Xuejiu, with his tenacious will and high spirit of research, has never given up research work in the environment of frequent battles over the years. He has successively created more than ten kinds of explosive firearms and engineering construction techniques, such as explosive packs, explosive cannons, slogan bullets, curved shooting mortars for convenient hand shooting, and改造ed extending shells, mortar launching explosives, river crossing grass bags, contact light bridges and pontoon bridges.
　　As early as 1948, he began to run engineering training classes. Liveliness and creativity are the characteristics of Chai Xuejiu's teaching method. What is even more admirable is his continuous research on academic theory and his responsible attitude and serious spirit in teaching. At the beginning of the training class, he concentrated all his energy on planning how to conduct coaching. Often, because a problem was not figured out, he would not sleep late at night, and the next day, as soon as dawn broke, he would go to teach his comrades to dig anti-personnel landmines. When conducting water training, he was with the students, not returning to the dormitory for four or five nights, and even bringing meals to the riverbank. Under his education, engineering soldiers graduated from one term after another and were sent to the troops batch after batch. He ran a total of twelve training classes, training 1,870 engineers, many of whom became meritorious heroes, outstanding demolition heroes, or bridging heroes directly under the division or army.
　　One arm was broken, and three or four thousand arms stretched out! This is another great contribution of Comrade Chai Xuejiu to the people.
　　In August 1948, he followed the counter-offensive army across the Yellow River. After completing the task of training engineers and blowing up railways with his extremely weak body, he followed the army across the Yangtze River in 1949. In June, he became the engineering battalion commander of a certain army, undertaking the important task of training new recruits and advancing into the southwest. Regardless of his own weakness, he insisted on working day and night. When building the Qujiang Huangjincun Bridge, he fainted on the bridge during the three days and four nights of rush work. After waking up, he still insisted on working. In less than a year, he and his engineering battalion traveled through the seven provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, building 64 bridges. Each time, they completed the task perfectly ahead of schedule, winning him the honorary title of "Pioneer of Road Opening" awarded by the corps. (Attached picture)

　　独臂爆破英雄柴学久
    夏扬
  （一）炸断了右臂
    抗日战争和解放战争初期，我军缺乏重武器，攻坚战斗中，工兵爆破常常起重要作用。在战斗中涌现了无数工兵爆破英雄。
    人民解放军第二野战军某部工兵营营长柴学久同志，就是这样的出色爆破英雄之一。十三年来，他创造了多种火器，训练了近两千的工兵。历次战斗中，他负过七次伤，立过二十七次功，得过两颗“人民功臣”奖章，受过三次通令嘉奖，荣获“独臂爆破英雄”的光荣称号。
    他是河北邢台西峙村人，家贫，父母早亡，幼时放牛、割草。一九三八年，他十七岁时，参加了在他家乡一带活动的八路军冀西游击队，出入敌后，进行训练民兵，对敌人展开普遍的地雷战。一九四○年，加入中国共产党。
    一九四二年七月，在中国人民抗日军政大学第八期毕业后，参加太行军区工兵队学习，同年十月，在赞皇许亭一带领导民兵和日伪进行边沿区斗争，为给民兵讲手榴弹构造和性能，不幸在卸雷管时手榴弹爆炸，负伤六、七处，炸断了他的右臂。
  （二）敌人不投降，把他炸死在碉堡里
    一九四五年八月，豫北平原秋露初降，我军举行全面大反攻，太行部队昼夜兼程向豫北进发。柴学久的工兵连（这时他已任副连长，此后不久，任连长。），配合步兵一举攻入清化城，歼灭伪军一千三百余人，最后只剩下城内西北角日寇一个中队一百二十余人所据守的大碉堡。当时我军没有大炮，眼看相距二十公尺的大碉堡，一天一夜攻不下来，敌人还顽强抵抗，并不断向我反扑。正当情况紧急的时候，他组织了一个爆破班，接近碉堡，安上炸药，亲自点火，结果只炸了一个窟窿。他气得脸色发白，一只手抱起十公斤炸药，冲向前去，敌人的机枪连珠射来，他毫不畏缩。只听见轰隆一声，碉堡又炸开了一个口。敌人有些恐慌了，但仍然不肯投降。他立即设法，创造了一种炸药包，带着工兵，爬上邻近的屋顶，一连向碉堡里投了十几个过去。同时向碉堡出口扔干柴，放火烧，一边继续扔手榴弹，把敌人全部炸死或烧死在里面。
  （三）发挥了人民军队高度的创造性和自我牺牲精神
    在豫北的焦作之战，柴学久同志，发挥了人民军队高度的创造性和自我牺牲精神。
    焦作是一座现代化的设防城市，最外层是严密的碉堡群，第二层是电网，第三层是外壕，第四层是外墙，电网外面，密布电雷，电网外壕间，以及外墙上每百公尺一个探照灯。当时我军由游击战争转入攻坚战，除迫击炮外，没有更重的火器，大部分干部战士，对于电网和探照灯，还很生疏。柴学久也暗暗感到不好下手。但爆破电网，是攻下焦作的关键。他于是带病跑到刚解放的焦作西大井工厂，研究破坏电网的方法。他起先叫一个人穿着胶皮衣服，戴着胶皮手套，用木柄上裹了胶皮的铡刀去砍通了电的铁丝网，刀刚砍下去，只见火星四溅，吐出一两尺长的火舌，而电网丝毫未受损失，铡刀有时还被电网吸住。经过一周时间的精心研究和实验，他创造了一种威力很大的爆炸筒，又创造了刁把钩探电器，亲自演习给部队看，讲解电网的原理，消除了大家的思想顾虑。
    攻城令下来了。
    柴学久担任爆破电网任务。他正在发疟疾，面色苍黄，身子很衰弱。但他勇敢地接受了任务。
    初秋天气，高粱和玉茭比人还高，他们三个人：他，一个通讯员和一个战士，在开阔的庄稼地里匐伏前进，爆炸筒常撞着庄稼，发出??的磨擦声。探照灯纵横交错的扫射着，强光照得他眼睛发花。不久，他们爬到了地的边缘，再通过前面二十公尺的开阔地带，就是电网了。但在这敌人交叉的火网内，探照灯强光照射下，要通过这段完全赤裸的地带，是不容易的。他略为踌躇了一下，向身后的通讯员和战士做了个手势，就不顾一切的一起冲到电网跟前。炸药还没完全埋好，敌人的机枪已经打起来，子弹就在脚边嗤嗤地钻进土去。他们迅速地结好电发火的长长的引火线，就拚命往回跑，在一个土坎后隐蔽起来，等待着攻击的信号。突然第一个信号起来了，一个严重的问题却钻进了他的脑子：如果第二个信号起来，爆破筒炸不了怎么办？毫无疑问：如果电发火炸不了，他会马上冲上去把它炸了的，但自己多半要同归于尽！这时，身边的通讯员也想到同一的问题，耽心地问他：“副连长！不响怎么办？”他立刻以严肃的口气回答：“响不了，冲上去也要把它炸了！”
  （四）以柴学久的爆炸声作为全线破击的信号
    一九四七年三月，为了牵制焦作的蒋匪新三师，直接配合歼灭孙殿英匪部的豫北战役，我军须在一夜间炸毁焦作、修武间的大小桥梁。身经百战的独臂英雄又承当了炸毁修武城西最大一座九孔桥的艰巨任务。并以九孔桥的爆炸声，作为全线同时破击的信号。
    天黑不久，他就和四个工兵，扛着八十公斤的炸药出发了。穿过稻田，就是敌人的护路封锁线，他们得特别小心地轻步前进。过了封锁线，就隐约望见了九孔桥和两端的桥头堡垒。他们迅速下到河边，借着河岸的倾斜度，隐蔽着察看地形和敌人的动静。他想：桥的两端是堡垒，上到桥面爆破是不可能的，万一被发觉，牺牲是小事，任务却不能完成了。如果从桥下爆破，因为桥座很高，也不济事，炸桥脚也不能将桥彻底炸断。于是他沿着河岸，接近铁桥，然后下到河中，涉着齐膝的河水，向中间的两个桥座移动。河底河石很滑，稍不小心就会跌倒。好容易到了桥脚，立刻爬上两根桥座，把炸药安置在桥架与桥座的接头处，然后点燃引线，跳下来就跑。等到敌人发觉，展开交叉火网向他们扫射时，九孔桥已“轰隆”一声，从中炸成数段。接着道清线上三十多座桥梁，都在一夜间炸毁了。
    柴学久带着胜利的微笑回来了，他们去时是五个人，回来时还是五个。
  （五）一只臂膀断了，三四千只臂膀伸了起来
    柴学久同志，以其坚韧的毅力与高度的钻研精神，几年以来，在战斗频繁的环境中，一直未放弃过研究工作，先后创造了炸药包、炸药炮、标语弹、曲射炮筒便手射，改造了延性炮弹、迫击炮发射炸药、渡河草包、接触轻便桥及浮桥等共十余种爆炸火器和工兵建筑技术。
    远在一九四八年，他就开始办工兵训练班。活泼、富于创造性，是柴学久教授法的特点，更令人敬佩的是他对学理的不断钻研，以及教学上的负责态度与认真精神。训练班开办之初，他就集中全部精力，盘算着如何进行教练，往往因为一个问题没有想通，深夜也不睡觉，而第二天天一微明，又去教同志们挖抗埋地雷了。在进行水上教练时，他和学员们在一起，四、五夜没回宿舍，连吃饭都送到河岸。在他的教育下，一期一期的工兵毕业了，又一批一批送到部队去。他总共办了十二次训练班，训练出了一千八百七十名工兵，其中有不少成了师或军直的功臣、出色的爆破英雄或架桥英雄。
    一只臂膀断了，三、四千只臂膀伸了起来！这就是柴学久同志对人民的又一伟大贡献。
    一九四八年八月，他随着反攻的大军，渡过黄河，以极瘦弱的身体，完成训练工兵、炸毁铁路的任务后，又于一九四九年随军打过长江，六月，任某军的工兵营营长。担任起训练新兵，进军西南的重任。他不顾自己体弱，日夜坚持工作。在建筑曲江黄金村大桥时，在三天四夜的赶工中，他曾晕倒在桥上，苏醒过来，仍坚持工作。不到一年，他和他的工兵营走遍赣、湘、桂、粤、滇、黔、川七省，修建桥梁六十四座，每次都是完满的提前完成任务，获得了兵团赠送给他的“开路先锋”的光荣称号。（附图片）
