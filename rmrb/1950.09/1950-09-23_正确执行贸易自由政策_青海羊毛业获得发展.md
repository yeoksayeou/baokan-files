Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th. As a result of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government's correct implementation of the free trade policy, the wool industry in the province's pastoral areas has developed. More than half of Qinghai Province's population relies on animal husbandry for a living, and wool products are the main source of income for herders. Before the province's liberation, the Ma Bufang bandit gang implemented a policy of unified purchase and sale, forcibly purchasing wool transported to Xining City by Mongolian and Tibetan herders at low prices, so that the herders' transportation income was often insufficient to cover transportation costs. Therefore, herders preferred to bury wool in the soil or let it rot rather than sell it. After the province was liberated in August last year, the Qinghai Provincial Trading Company correctly implemented the policy of free trade and equal exchange, established purchasing stations in major towns, purchased large quantities of wool at reasonable prices, and promoted essential goods for the people's lives. In Yushu District (a Tibetan area), more than 1,600 li from Xining City, the trading company also launched purchasing operations under extremely difficult conditions. According to statistics, from August last year to May this year, the province's public and private merchants purchased approximately seven million catties of wool. The state-owned fur company alone purchased 900,000 catties in half a year. Due to the correct implementation of the free trade policy by the People's Government, the ratio between wool and industrial products has also changed greatly. In the past, every hundred catties of wool could only be exchanged for two zhang of blue serge cloth, but now it can be exchanged for three pi of blue serge cloth (calculated as three pi equals three zhang). As wool trade developed, the purchasing power of herders has gradually increased. In the past six months, the province's trading company transported and sold more than 14,000 pi of cotton cloth, more than 10,000 pi of homespun cloth, and more than 13,000 packages of Fucha tea to various places. In addition, it purchased 15,000 dan of grain to supply herders in various places. For example, comparing months, sales of tea in May were more than 2,200 packages, and in June they increased to more than 9,100 packages.

### 正确执行贸易自由政策  青海羊毛业获得发展

　　正确执行贸易自由政策
    青海羊毛业获得发展
    【新华社西安十六日电】青海省人民政府正确执行贸易自由政策的结果，该省畜牧区的羊毛业已获得发展。按青海省半数以上的人口，均以畜牧为生，羊毛产品是牧民主要的收入。该省未解放前，马匪步芳实行统购统销政策，对蒙、藏牧民运往西宁市的羊毛，强迫低价收购，致使牧民贩运所得往往不够运费。因此，牧民们宁愿把羊毛埋入土内或让其烂掉，也不愿出卖。去年八月该省解放后，青海省贸易公司正确执行了贸易自由与等价交换政策，在各主要城镇建立了收购站，以合理价格大量收购羊毛，并推销群众生活必需品。在距西宁市一千六百余华里的玉树区（藏民区），贸易公司亦在极其困难的条件下展开了收购业务。据统计：自去年八月至今年五月，全省经公、私商的收购羊毛约达七百万斤。仅国营皮毛公司半年中即已收购九十万斤。由于人民政府正确执行了贸易自由政策，羊毛与工业品的比价也大大地改变了，过去每百斤羊毛仅换青斜纹布两丈多，现在可以换到青斜纹布三匹（按三匹等于三丈）。因为羊毛贸易发展，牧民的购买力已逐渐提高。半年来，经该省贸易公司运销各地的包括大布一万四千余匹，土布万余匹，茯茶一万三千余封。此外，并购买了一万五千市石粮食，供应各地牧民。如按月比较，五月份销茶两千二百余封，六月份即增至九千一百余封。
