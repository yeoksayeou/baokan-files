　　Donate Winter Clothing to Disaster Victims!
    The disaster victims in some disaster-stricken areas in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan are urgently in need of winter clothing!
    Due to the past destruction of the Huai River water system by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's breaching of the Yellow River into the Huai River, the people in the Huai River basin have long lived a life of suffering in continuous floods. Since July of this year, the above-mentioned areas have again encountered floods, with the disaster in northern Anhui being particularly severe. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, the people in the disaster areas are bravely fighting against the disaster and have basically realized the slogan of "no one starves to death." Now we must also put forward and strive to realize the slogan of "no one freezes to death." We warmly hope that the General Association for Soliciting Winter Clothing for Disaster Victims in northern Anhui, northern Jiangsu, Hebei, and Henan, and its branches in various places, can complete this task in a timely manner. We also hope that the people of the whole country will fully promote the spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship, and actively donate winter clothing to disaster victims!
    Under the leadership of the Central People's Government, the Chinese people, who are rich in struggle experience, have begun to escape from disaster. This year, in addition to the above-mentioned areas being affected by disasters, all parts of the country have generally had bumper harvests. We believe that the task of collecting winter clothing for disaster victims this winter will surely be completed soon with the enthusiastic donations from the people of the whole country!

　　捐助灾民寒衣！
    皖北、苏北、河北、河南等部分受灾地区的灾民，正迫切地需要寒衣！
    由于过去蒋介石匪帮决黄入淮，打烂了淮河水系，使淮河流域的人民，长期在连续性的水灾中过着痛苦的生活。今年七月以来，上述各地，又遭遇了水灾，皖北的灾情，尤为惨重。灾区人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府正确的领导下，英勇地与灾难作斗争，已经在基本上实现了“不饿死人”的口号。现在我们还要提出并努力实现“不冻死人”的口号。我们热烈地希望皖北、苏北、河北、河南灾民寒衣劝募总会和各地分会，能够及时地完成这个任务。我们更盼望全国人民，充分发扬团结互助和友爱的精神，踊跃捐助灾民寒衣！
    富有斗争经验的中国人民，在中央人民政府的领导下，已经开始脱离了灾难，今年除上述部分地区受灾之外，全国各地都普遍丰收。我们相信为今冬灾民募集寒衣的任务，一定能够在全国人民热情捐输之下，早日完成！
