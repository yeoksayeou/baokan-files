　　Inspecting Work While Summarizing Experience
    Northeast Industrial Departments Conduct Deep Rectification

    [Shenyang News] According to the Northeast Daily, the departments under the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department are implementing the spirit of the Northeast Bureau's Industrial Work Conference by focusing on enterprise management as the main content of their work inspections. Various methods and steps are currently being taken to implement this policy.

    The Northeast Industry Department convened the directors and section chiefs of its subordinate bureaus to report on the rectification situation. After correcting some deviations that occurred at the beginning of the rectification, the rectification began to get on the right track. Each section, bureau, and company grasped the key points of the rectification: "low quality, high cost, and large waste," and inspected each problem one by one, proposing improvement measures. Most units sent work inspection teams to focus on on-site inspections and study improvement measures.

    During the rectification, shortcomings in the work were inspected, and advanced experiences were summarized. After the Industrial Work Rectification Conference, the Northeast Industry Department, based on the current industrial production situation and needs, studied and proposed the experience of Chen Yucai's model workshop at Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 5. It also promulgated a decision to strengthen workshop work to help factories and mines grasp the grassroots organization of production—the workshop—and implement various specific management tasks within the workshop. The Industry Department is preparing to convene a symposium for workshop management personnel, striving to summarize and study more experiences. The Light Industry Administration is also summarizing the experience of the Shixian Paper Mill in implementing production instruction charts, preparing to promote it in various factories.

    In order to exchange experience and improve production, the Industry Department also convened a special steel production conference in Benxi, Fushun, and Dalian. The focus of the conference was on solving the quality problems of special steel. In order to adapt to the needs of Northeast industrial and mining construction and production, and to unify scientific research and industrial inspection work, the Northeast Scientific Research and Industrial Inspection Work Conference was convened. These conferences will greatly contribute to future technical improvements in production.

    In order to further implement the security responsibility system, it has been decided to conduct a comprehensive autumn security inspection. This inspection will be led by the Industry Department, with cadres from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast People's Government's Labor Department and Public Security Department participating. The Industry Department has also instructed the leading cadres of each bureau, company, factory, and mine to personally take action, mobilize all workers, technicians, and staff to participate, so that this inspection becomes a mass movement of inspection and rectification.
