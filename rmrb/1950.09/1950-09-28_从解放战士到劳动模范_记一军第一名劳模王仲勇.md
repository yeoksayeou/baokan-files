　　From Liberation Soldier to Labor Model
    ——A Record of Wang Zhongyong, the Number One Labor Model of the First Army
  Grievance-telling education improved awareness
    Wang Zhongyong is the number one labor model of the First Army of the First Field Army. He was selected to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. He is a soldier in the Fifth Platoon of the Machine Gun Company of the First Battalion of the × Regiment, twenty-three years old, and from Shanghuyu Village, Shouyang, Shanxi. Wang Zhongyong was born into a poor peasant family and began working in the fields at the age of nine. At the age of nineteen, he was conscripted into the Hu bandit army. In the two years in the reactionary army, he suffered all kinds of torture.
    It was not until the Fumei Campaign in 1949 that Wang Zhongyong was liberated. He was initially incorporated into the Replenishment Training Regiment. After the grievance-telling education, his class consciousness was raised. Therefore, during the two-thousand-mile march in the Northwest, he demonstrated a spirit of perseverance, responsibility, unity, and mutual assistance and was selected as a marching model for the entire regiment.
    He was added to the Sixth Regiment last October. This January, after Chairman Mao called on the army to participate in production, his enthusiasm increased even more. In the three tasks of land reclamation, water mill construction, and construction of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, he was selected as the number one labor model of the entire company.
    Later, in the entire battalion, he was rated as the labor model of the battalion. Soon after, he joined the New Democratic Youth League and soon gloriously joined the Communist Party.
  Determined to make great contributions on the Qinghai-Tibet Road
    In the spring, he heard that the higher authorities had arranged for them to build the Qinghai-Tibet Highway and immediately made up his mind: "To make great contributions on the Qinghai-Tibet Road." Soon, this became a resounding slogan in the army at the time.
    Building the Qinghai-Tibet Highway required traversing the most arduous Mount Ela. Mount Ela is high and steep, more than 4,500 meters above sea level, with a cold climate and thin air, and is subject to snow, rain, wind, and hail. At the same time, it is a marshy mud area. When digging marshy mud to build the road surface, the soldiers had to work barefoot in the cold mud. Under the active leadership of Wang Zhongyong, each person in his platoon averaged two cubic meters per day (each cubic meter required digging up more than 2,000 catties of marshy mud and padding with more than 4,000 catties of stones). In the Jingbiyan Beach area, when opening up new roadbeds, his group averaged as much as 7.2 cubic meters per person per day. In order to make the roadbed more solid and durable, it was decided to dig down eight centimeters to remove the marshy mud. However, after digging three centimeters, the soil below was frozen like stone. Comrades with weak bodies could not dig it. Wang Zhongyong dug for a day, and several cracks appeared on his hands, and the cracks bled as he dug; but he finally conquered the frozen ground and successfully completed this arduous task.
  Carrying 3,500 catties of stone in one morning
    The Xiaodongliang project was also in marshy mud. In the project, it was necessary to carry stones through 300 meters of muddy road. Wang Zhongyong volunteered to take on the task of carrying stones. Each day, in four hours of work in the morning, he carried stones thirty-five times, averaging more than a hundred catties each time. In one morning, he carried more than 3,500 catties of stone, creating the highest record in the entire company. The cold wind cracked his feet, and they bled as he walked. The platoon leader knew that the cracks on his feet were very severe and told him to rest, but he replied happily, "Now is the time to overcome difficulties."
    Mount Ela, this marshy mud area, has many springs. If there were no good drainage ditches, the roadbed would not be consolidated. Under the call of the battalion party committee to "Everyone is responsible, everyone thinks of ideas, and resolutely builds the road firmly and well," many new creations emerged in various units.
  Create new drainage ditches
    The Third Platoon of the Second Company first invented a semi-drainage ditch. The method was: at the spring, a stone ditch was built to allow the water to flow out. When Wang Zhongyong saw it, he thought: In this way, spring water can still seep out from the stone crevices, and the roadbed will still not be consolidated. He thought carefully, experimented several times, and finally succeeded in a new method: first paving the bottom of the ditch with stone slabs, then stacking stone slabs on both sides of the ditch, filling it with fine sand; covering the top with stone slabs, and building the ditch opening like a gun eye in a machine gun emplacement. The semi-drainage ditch built in this way was the best in the entire battalion during inspection.
    The semi-drainage ditch is a new creation in the construction of marshy mud in Mount Ela. Something that does not exist in engineering. It has a great drainage effect, can drain the spring water inside the roadbed and the rainwater that seeps into the road surface, and keep the road surface dry, solid, and durable. The successful experiment of Comrade Wang Zhongyong brought confidence and courage to the troops. Various units have created many new things, thus improving the quality of road construction and labor efficiency. He often encouraged other comrades, saying: "The Tibetan people are eagerly awaiting us to liberate them. If the road is not built firmly, it will not be passable after two trips." This is precisely his spirit of high responsibility for road construction.
  High degree of class love
    Wang Zhongyong has a high degree of class love and is good at uniting the masses. In order to help others, he often forgets everything about himself. When he went to carry stones with his comrades on Mount Ela, he often quietly pulled the rope closer to himself to save his comrades effort. The platoon leader often tried to stop him, but he always smiled and said: "It doesn't matter, I am in good health." Once, the deputy platoon leader Zhao Tingyuan was very ill, and Comrade Wang Zhongyong took care of his needs. Zhao Tingyuan needed to drink water and take medicine at night. The climate on the grassland is often minus eighteen degrees at night, but he forgot everything about himself and got up five or six times a night to boil water for him.
    Comrade Wang Zhongyong not only has a strong desire to improve himself, but also cares about the progress of his comrades. The platoon leader had a bad personality and often lost his temper with everyone. He talked to the platoon leader to help him overcome his shortcomings. The soldier Guo Quancai did not have a strong labor concept and did not work hard. Comrade Wang Zhongyong had individual talks with him and said: "Your family was liberated long ago. You came very late and did not fight in the war; now is the time to build the motherland, and we should make contributions to the people in construction."
    Comrade Wang Zhongyong is the head of the cultural study group and is responsible for leading the study of culture. Li Ji, Wen Jifu, Guo Quancai, and others in their platoon liked to play cards. He persuaded them and gave them the fountain pen awarded to him by the battalion and the paper awarded to him by the company. Every day after the culture class, he urged everyone to review their lessons. With his help, the progress of all the comrades in the class has been very rapid. (Attached picture)

　　从解放战士到劳动模范
    ——记一军第一名劳模王仲勇
  诉苦教育提高了觉悟
    王仲勇，是第一野战军一军的第一名劳动模范。这次被选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议代表。他是×部一营机炮连五班的战士，现年二十三岁，山西寿阳上湖峪村人。王仲勇出身于贫苦的农民家庭，九岁时，就开始下地受苦。十九岁那年，被胡匪军抓去当兵。在反动派军队的两年中，受尽了折磨。
    一九四九年扶眉战役时，王仲勇才得到解放。开始编入补训团。经过了诉苦教育，他的阶级觉悟提高了。所以，在西北两千里的进军时，表现了坚苦负责，团结互助的精神，而被选为全团的行军模范。
    去年十月补入六团。今年一月，毛主席号召军队参加生产以后，他的积极性更加提高了。他在开荒、修筑水磨、修建青藏公路三次任务中，都被选为全连第一名劳动模范。
    以后在全营中，评为营的劳动模范。接着他加入了新民主主义青年团，不久又光荣的参加了共产党。
  要在青藏路上立大功
    春天，他听说上级布置好要他们修建青藏公路，即下了决心：“要在青藏路上立大功”。不久，这便成了当时部队响亮的口号。
    修青藏公路要经过最艰险的鄂拉山。鄂拉山地势高峻，拔海四千五百公尺以上，气候寒冷，空气稀薄，时雪雨，时风雹。同时它是泛浆泥地区，挖泛浆泥修路面，战士们都得赤着脚在冰冷的泥泞中劳动。在王仲勇积极带头下，他班里每人每天平均挖二立方（每立方要挖掉泛浆泥两千余斤，垫石头四千斤以上）。在精鼻眼滩地区，新开路基时，他组每人每天平均竟挖到七点二立方。为了使路基更加坚固持久，决定往下挖掉泛浆泥八公寸。可是挖了三公寸，下面的土冻得像石头一样。身体弱的同志，是挖不动的。王仲勇挖了一天，手上也挣开了几个裂口，挖起来裂口往外流血；但他终于征服了冻地，胜利地完成了这个艰苦的任务。
  一上午背三千五百斤石头
    小东梁的工程又是泛浆泥。工程中须要经过三百米泥泞的道路去背石头。王仲勇就抢着担任了背石头的任务。每天上午四个钟头劳动时间，他背石三十五次，平均每次百余斤。一上午就要背石头三千五百余斤，创造了全连最高纪录。寒风吹裂了他两脚，走起路来就往外流血。班长知道他脚上裂口裂得很厉害叫他休息，但他却愉快地回答：“现在就是克服困难的时候。”
    鄂拉山，这泛浆泥地区，泉眼很多，如果没有很好排水沟，路基就不会巩固。在营党委提出“人人负责，个个想法，坚决把路修牢、修好”的号召下，各单位都出现了很多新的创造。
  创造新排水沟
    二连三排先发明了半排水沟。作法是：在泉眼处，用石砌成水沟，让水流出。王仲勇看见了，想道：这样泉水仍能从石缝中浸出，路基还得不到巩固。他就周密思考，三番五次试验，终于试验成功了一个新的办法：把沟底先用石板铺好，然后沟两边用石板垒起，填满了细沙；上边用石板盖顶，并把沟口砌成和机枪工事的枪眼一样。这样修成的半排水沟，在检查时，为全营最好的一个。
    半排水沟是鄂拉山修泛浆泥中新的创造。工程学上没有的东西。排水作用很大，能排出路基内部的泉水和路面上浸入的雨水，使路面保持干燥，坚固持久。王仲勇同志的试验成功，给部队带来了创造的信心与勇气。各单位都创造了很多新的东西，因此也提高了修路质量与劳动效率。他常鼓励其他同志说：“西藏人民正渴望我们去解放他们，如果不把路修坚固，走上两次就不能通车了。”这正是他为修路高度负责的精神。
  高度的阶级友爱
    王仲勇有着高度的阶级友爱精神，善于团结群众。他为了帮助别人，常常忘掉自己的一切。他在鄂拉山和同志去抬石头，为了让同志省力，常悄悄地把绳子拉到自己跟前。班长经常劝止他，但他总是微笑着说：“不要紧，我身体好。”一次，副班长赵廷元病得很重，王仲勇同志便给他端屎端尿。赵廷元晚上要喝水吃药。草原上气候，夜间常是零下十八度，但他却忘掉了自己的一切，一夜起来五、六次，给他烧开水。
    王仲勇同志不但自己要求进步的心很强，并关心同志的进步。班长个性不好，常对大家发脾气。他就找班长谈话，帮助他克服缺点。战士郭全才劳动观念不强，作工不出力，王仲勇同志就和他个别谈话说：“你的家早解放了，你来得很迟，又没有打仗；现在正是建设祖国的时期，我们应该在建设中为人民立功。”
    王仲勇同志是文化学习小组长，对领导学习文化也负责任。他们班里李计、文吉甫、郭全才等爱打扑克，他便对他们进行说服工作，并把营里奖给他的水笔和连里奖给的纸张，送给他们。每天上文化课后，他就督促大家温习功课。在他的帮助下，全班同志，学习进步都很快。（附图片）
