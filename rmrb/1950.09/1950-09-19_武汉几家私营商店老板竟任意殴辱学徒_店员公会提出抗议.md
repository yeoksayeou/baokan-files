To the Editor:

Recently, several incidents of shop owners brutally beating apprentices have occurred in Hankou City. I hope to publish them in the newspaper to draw everyone's attention.

Gao Yingzhong, the owner of Gao Xinji Western Clothing Store at 89 Jiqing Street, Hankou, stabbed Zhou Yintang, a fifteen-year-old apprentice, with scissors. The incident unfolded as follows: In July, when Gao Yingzhong's child had a birthday, the apprentice Zhou Yintang brought tea into the room, and the cup made a loud noise. Gao, hearing this from outside, assumed the cup was broken. He then grabbed tailoring scissors, ran into the room, and stabbed Zhou Yintang twice in the right leg, threatening him not to speak about it. Several days after the incident, the apprentice Zhou Yintang's mother came to the shop to collect bedding for washing and noticed that her son's leg was wrapped in cloth. She asked Zhou Yintang about it, but he was afraid to tell the truth. Upon unwrapping the cloth, the wound was already festering and smelled foul. After repeated questioning by his mother, he finally revealed that the owner had stabbed him with scissors. At that time, the apprentice's mother negotiated with the owner, Gao Yingzhong, hoping he would provide medical treatment, but Gao Yingzhong refused. Left with no choice, Zhou's mother took her son home and sought medical attention from a doctor for ten consecutive days before he recovered, incurring a total of 174,000 yuan in medical expenses. When Zhou Yintang returned to the shop after recovering, Gao Yingzhong refused to take him back.

In addition, Yang Yongyao, the owner of Zhonghe Radio Shop at 1329 Zhongshan Avenue, has brutally beaten apprentice Wang Shengxue three times since the liberation of Wuhan. Each time he made a self-criticism, he always guaranteed not to hit people again, but on August 16th, he beat him again. Zhou Sanrong, the owner of Zhou Yifa on Sanmin Road, returned from Zhongshan Park at 11:30 pm on August 16th and stayed awake upstairs until after 12:00 am. The apprentice, Hu Changxiong, seeing that it was past 12:00 am and unsure whether the shop owner was asleep upstairs, turned off the lights. Zhou Sanrong then went downstairs, slapped Hu Changxiong several times, and proceeded to kick him, hitting him with leather slippers, causing swelling of the face and injuries to the waist and legs. Afterwards, Zhou Sanrong instructed the shop's cashier, "Do not allow Hu Changxiong to pay a single penny of medical expenses at the shop!" Only after the union learned of the incident was Hu Changxiong sent to the hospital for treatment.

Beating people is a barbaric act. Beating people is illegal. The local shop assistants' union, representing 30,000 shop assistants, has protested to these private shop owners. We hope that relevant departments will pay attention to this and handle it quickly.

### 武汉几家私营商店老板竟任意殴辱学徒  店员公会提出抗议

　　武汉几家私营商店老板竟任意殴辱学徒
    店员公会提出抗议编辑同志：
    最近，汉口市接连发生了几件商店老板毒打学徒的事件。希望把它们在报纸上发表，以引起大家的注意。
    汉口吉庆街八十九号高新记西服店老板高应中，用剪刀刺伤十五岁学徒周银堂。事情的经过如下：七月间，高应中的小孩做生日，学徒周银堂端茶到房内，杯子碰得很响。高在外面听到以后，以为是把杯子打破了。他于是拿着裁衣剪刀，跑到房里来，在周银堂的右腿上连刺了二下，并威胁他不准声张。事情发生后几天，学徒周银堂的母亲到店来拿被褥洗，看见儿子腿上包裹着布，即向周银堂询问。但周银堂不敢讲出来。周母解开布一看，伤口已经腐烂发臭。经周母再三追问，他始说出是老板用剪刀刺的。当时，学徒的母亲向老板高应中交涉，希望给他诊治，但高应中拒绝了。周母无法，只好将儿子领回家中，找医生连诊十天，方才痊愈，共化医药费人民币十七万四千元。周银堂伤愈回店时，高应中竟拒绝收留。
    此外，中山大道一三二九号中和无线电行老板杨永耀，武汉解放以来，毒打过学徒王胜学三次，每次检讨时，总说保证以后不再打人，但在八月十六日又毒打了一次。三民路周义发老板周三荣八月十六日晚十一时半由中山公园回来后，一直到十二点多钟在楼上还未睡觉。学徒胡昌雄看见已过十二点钟，又不知店主在楼上睡觉与否，就把灯关了。周三荣就下楼打了胡昌雄几个耳光，接着用脚踢，脱下皮拖鞋打，将胡脸部打肿腰腿打伤。事后周三荣并嘱咐该号出纳说：“不准胡昌雄在店支付一个钱的医药费！”工会得悉此事后，才将胡昌雄送到医院诊治。
    打人是一种野蛮行为。打人是违法的。此间店员工会，代表三万店员已对这几家私商老板提出抗议。我们希望有关部门予以重视，并迅速处理。
