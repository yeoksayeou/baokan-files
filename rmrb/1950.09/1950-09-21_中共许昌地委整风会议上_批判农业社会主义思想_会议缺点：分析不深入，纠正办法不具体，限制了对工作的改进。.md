The CCP Xuchang Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting
    Criticizes Agricultural Socialism Ideology
    Shortcomings of the Meeting: Analysis Not Thorough, Corrective Measures Not Concrete, Limiting Improvement of Work.
    [This Newspaper's Report] The CCP Henan Xuchang Prefectural Committee's rectification meeting began on August 16 and ended on September 5. After studying documents, the meeting examined the implementation of policies and the work style of cadres, focusing primarily on criticizing agricultural socialist thinking among cadres. After the land reform, some cadres mistakenly applied the "rely on the poor and hired peasants, unite with the middle peasants" line from the land reform to production. Consequently, they resisted certain specific production policies, such as freedom of lending, freedom of land sales, and freedom of hiring labor, and did not earnestly implement these policies. Because land rights were not clearly defined, poor and hired peasants were afraid to improve and fertilize the land they had been allocated, and a few had the idea of relying on the government and squeezing the middle peasants. The general middle peasants were afraid to work harder and develop production. Based on these situations, the meeting carefully studied the current production policies, repeatedly explained the guarantee of freedom of lending, renting, hiring labor, and buying and selling land, and clarified that organizing to develop production so that the lives of all peasants move towards prosperity is the only correct direction for rural production in the future.
    Secondly, the meeting exposed the commandism and bureaucratism in work. The coercive command style of cadres has changed somewhat compared to last year, after two mass work conferences exposed and criticized such behavior. In the second half of last year, cadres who beat people accounted for more than 50% of the total; in the first half of this year, they accounted for 8.3% of the total. These errors mostly occurred in work that required explaining and mobilizing the masses, such as river management and grain requisition. Some leaders confused initiative with coercive command, believing that "although mistakes are made, the work is active," and thus "a self-criticism settles the matter." This erroneous thinking indulged the commandism errors of the cadres below. (Editor's Note: The error of coercive command is not only manifested in illegal behaviors such as beating people or arbitrarily detaining and scolding people. All crude and simplistic work methods that do not proceed based on the level of awareness of the masses, do not conduct patient explanations and persuasion to the masses, and do not humbly consult with the masses are manifestations of commandism. On this point, the inspection of the Xuchang Prefectural Committee's rectification meeting is insufficient.)
    Bureaucratic work styles are manifested in the following four aspects: First, when mobilizing the masses to complete work tasks, party committees at all levels do not grasp policies for earnest leadership, but instead hand it over to a certain department and then completely ignore it, without any further supervision and inspection of this work through the party organization. This has led to many incidents that seriously harm the interests of the people. During the grain transport in June, more than 150 cattle were overworked, frozen, or died in the entire region, seriously damaging the interests of the people. Second, in production work, the leading organs are satisfied with general calls. The lower levels then use "numbers" to respond to the higher levels, which fostered a formalistic work style. Some also indiscriminately issue forms and instructions, resulting in nothing being accomplished. Third, in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, a principle-less leniency is adopted. In some places, prisoners who should not have been released were released because "it costs too much to feed the prisoners and the expenses cannot be reimbursed." Fourth, the phenomenon of not cherishing state property is quite serious. Based on the above inspection, the meeting proposed: strengthening policy education for cadres, conducting investigations and analyzing situations when assigning tasks and issuing instructions, carrying out democratic movements within and outside the party, and strengthening discipline as basic methods for improving leadership.
    During the meeting, the leadership paid attention to correcting deviations at any time. First, at the beginning of presenting the situation, the leadership of some units did not let go and promote democracy. Some were busy explaining the speeches of the lower levels, some required others' criticisms to be 100% correct, some branches retrieved materials reported by the小组 (xiǎozǔ, group) to the presidium, and some still had the idea of "family scandals should not be made public" and concealed errors. After the leadership discovered this, they promptly criticized those who suppressed criticism, publicly exposed the errors of those who concealed errors, and launched criticism and self-criticism from top to bottom. They also corrected deviations that entangled personal historical baggage or departmental relations.
    Secondly, at the beginning of the inspection, some branches listed dozens or even hundreds of opinions without any central focus. Then it was "we have finished speaking, let's see the leadership's self-criticism." The leadership then had no way to analyze and examine this pile of opinions. Some branches presented and rectified a little at a time, adding a label to each fact, and thus could not delve deeply. The method of correcting this deviation was to gradually focus on a few major issues and expose materials around these issues; then, select one of these issues as a typical example and conduct a comprehensive analysis and inspection.
            (Xuchang Prefectural Committee Rectification Meeting Communication Group)
    Editor's Note: It is very necessary for the Xuchang Prefectural Committee to inspect the implementation of rural production policies and expose some commandist and bureaucratic errors in the rectification meeting. However, there is still a lack of in-depth analysis of these errors. The understanding of commandism is one example. The corrective measures are also not concrete enough, which limits the role of improving cadres and improving work.

　　中共许昌地委整风会议上
    批判农业社会主义思想
    会议缺点：分析不深入，纠正办法不具体，限制了对工作的改进。
    【本报讯】中共河南许昌地委整风会议于八月十六日开始，九月五日结束。会议经过学习文件，检查了政策执行情况与干部作风，首先着重批判了干部中的农业社会主义思想。土地改革后有些干部错误地把土改中的“依靠贫雇，团结中农”路线搬运到生产中来，因而对生产中的一些具体政策，如借贷自由，土地买卖自由，雇工出租自由等有思想抵抗，就不认真执行这些政策。由于地权未确定，贫雇农不敢在分得的土地上加工上肥，并有少数有困难的，有依靠政府和挤中农的思想；一般中农不敢加紧劳动，发展生产。根据这些情况，会议上仔细研究了当前的生产政策，反复解释保证借贷、出租、雇工及买卖土地等自由，明确了组织起来发展生产使全体农民生活走向富裕是今后农村生产的唯一正确方向。
    其次，揭发了工作中的命令主义和官僚主义作风，干部中的强迫命令作风，经过去年两次群众工作会议的揭发批判，今年的情况已有所不同。去年下半年区干部打人者占总数的百分之五十以上，今年上半年占总数的百分之八点三。这种错误多半发现在治河、征粮等需要向群众解释动员的工作上。某些领导者把积极性和强迫命令混淆起来，认为“虽犯错误，但工作积极”，于是“检讨检讨了事”。这种错误思想放纵了下面干部的命令主义错误。（编者按：强迫命令的错误并不只表现在打人或随便扣押人骂人等违法行为上。一切不根据群众觉悟程度办事，不向群众进行耐心的解释说服，不虚心地和群众商量的粗暴和简单的工作方式，都是命令主义的表现。在这一点上，许昌地委整风会议的检查是不够的。）
    官僚主义作风表现在以下四个方面：一、在动员群众完成工作任务时，各级党委不掌握政策认真领导，而是交给某一部门去办后就根本不管了，再不通过党的组织，对这一工作的监督与检查。这就发生了很多严重危害人民利益的事件。六月间运粮中，全专区就累死冻死耕牛一百五十余头之多，严重的损害了人民利益。二、在生产工作上，领导机关满足于一般号召。下边就以“数字”来支应上级，滋长了形式主义作风。有的则滥发表格、指示，结果一事无成。三、在镇压反革命分子上，采取无原则的宽大，有的地方为了“犯人吃饭多无法报销”而释放了不应释放的犯人。四、不爱护国家财产的现象相当严重。根据以上检查，会议提出了：以加强干部政策教育，布置任务发指示要调查研究分析情况，开展党内外的民主运动，加强纪律性等作为改进领导的基本办法。
    会议中，领导上注意了随时纠正偏向。首先，在开始摆情况时，若干单位领导上不放手发扬民主，有的忙于对下边的发言作解释，有的要求别人的批评百分之百的正确；有的支部把小组反映给主席团的材料追回；有的还存有“家丑不可外扬”的思想而隐瞒错误。领导上发现后，都及时给压制批评者以批评，公开揭发隐瞒错误者的错误，自上而下展开批评与自我批评。并纠正了纠缠于个人历史包袱或部门关系等问题上的偏向。
    其次，在检查开始，有些支部漫无中心的罗列了几十条甚至几百条意见。然后是“我们说完了，看领导上检讨吧”。领导上对于这一堆意见则无从下手分析检讨。有的支部是摆一点整一点，一个事实加一个帽子，因此钻不进去。纠正这一偏向的方法是逐步集中几个主要问题，围绕这些问题揭发材料；然后从中选择某个问题，做为典型，进行全面的分析检查。
            （中共许昌地委整风会议通讯组）
    编者按：许昌地委在整风会议中检查了农村生产政策的执行情况，并揭发了若干命令主义、官僚主义的错误，这是十分必要的。但是对于这些错误还缺少深入的分析，对命令主义的认识即是一例。纠正的办法也还不够具体，这样对于提高干部、改进工作的作用是有限制的。
