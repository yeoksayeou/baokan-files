　　The Suiyuan Uprising Troops Are Moving Forward
    Xin Min
    Successfully completed reorganization, established various systems of the People's Liberation Army.
    The Suiyuan troops who revolted on "September 19th" last year, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's policy of unity and striving for progress, reforming the old system and implementing new policies, and with the efforts of Generals Fu Zuoyi and Dong Qiwu, have made significant progress in the past year. The original command organs of the uprising troops were merged with the Suiyuan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army in December last year. On New Year's Day this year, the newly formed leading organ – the Suiyuan Military Region – was announced, undertaking the task of leading the unity and transformation work of the uprising troops. In January this year, the Suiyuan Military Region, headed by Generals Fu and Dong, convened army, division, and brigade commanders of the uprising troops, as well as army and division-level political cadres preparing to be sent to the uprising troops, and held a senior cadre study class, which conducted serious research on the nature, army-building principles, and political work system of the People's Liberation Army over two weeks. In early February, the military region held a high-level cadre meeting and passed the reorganization plan for the uprising troops. In late February, the establishment of political organs at the army, division, and regiment levels began. By early April, the reorganization of various units was largely completed. The military region then convened meetings on staff, supply, and health work, establishing various systems of the People's Liberation Army in the troops. In mid-April, various units successively entered into large-scale production. During the production period, various democratic systems of the People's Liberation Army were initially established, transforming the ideology of the troops, improving officer-soldier and military-civilian relations, and significant progress was made. On the basis of the continuous progress of the troops, the task of cultivating more than 110,000 mu of land and building 2,023,200 cubic meters of canals and dams was completed (calculated up to the end of June).
    Transforming thinking, taking the people's road.
    Raising awareness of the New Democracy and transforming old ideas has become a craze in the uprising troops. All on-the-job cadres in various organs and units have implemented a system of two hours of study per day. The military region also established a military and political cadre study group, and each army and division also held short-term rotation training teams.
    Over the past year, everyone has studied the history of social development and current affairs policies. The doubts that once existed among cadres, such as worrying that the Communists would despise and attack them, and adopting a wait-and-see attitude of neither advancing nor retreating, neither progressing nor opposing, have been largely eliminated. When the first phase of the third detachment of the study group was assigned work, the entire class wrote a letter to the cadres of the study group, determined to wholeheartedly serve the people, guaranteeing that they would not do anything harmful to the people after returning to the team, and would do their best to do things beneficial to the people, and they did indeed do so. The commander of a certain cavalry regiment once attacked Hejian in Jizhong in 1948. In the past, he did this to carry out orders. During the study process, he realized that he had let the people down by doing so. After several fierce internal struggles, he automatically handed over the Kuomintang Renaissance Society and other reactionary organization documents and three privately hidden pistols. After watching the movie "Children of China," he shed tears of shame and pain. He also wrote a letter of determination, vowing to make amends for his sins in future work. A certain company commander of a certain division was full of doubts before studying, his work was sluggish, and he wanted to pull up the flag and become a bandit. After returning to the company after studying, he summoned all the soldiers of the company and publicly reviewed his past mistakes of beating and scolding soldiers and embezzling funds, and guaranteed that he would never repeat them. He checked the company's roster of weapons, ammunition, personnel, and horses, and reported the "empty quotas" to the regimental headquarters for cancellation. In order to implement the new system, he concentrated the meals (which were previously divided), improved the soldiers' lives, and took out his old savings to buy seven pots and one hundred bowls to establish a company housekeeping system. He began to regularly talk to the soldiers individually, asking about their well-being. He personally carried water and swept the yard every morning.
    Many uprising cadres, after studying and transforming, broke down their doubts, criticized and negated their past, and wholeheartedly wished to fight for the New Democracy, and redetermined to take the people's road. Among the 1,069 people in the first detachment of the study group, 525 automatically confessed their reactionary party affiliations, 70 confessed their secret agent relations, and 94 pieces of privately hidden documents, guns, and communications equipment were handed over. At the same time, 84 people were rated as study models, and 105 joined the New Democratic Youth League. Due to ideological progress, many uprising cadres showed a new style and new atmosphere of humbly learning, working hard, and actively participating in production.
    The democratic system in the troops is gradually established.
    After the establishment of political organs and political work at all levels, military and political committees above the regimental level, military and political groups at the company and battalion levels, and democratic systems such as economic groups, political work groups, study groups, discussion meetings, evaluation meetings, and other conference reports were established in the company. The system of beating and scolding was generally abolished, the political status of soldiers was improved, the awareness of soldiers was raised, and the troops were consolidated.
    In the process of implementing the above-mentioned democratic system, many problems initially occurred. The soldiers believed that they were liberated, democratized, and wanted to turn the tables and take revenge, but they did not dare to come forward. The cadres were afraid of democracy, regarding democracy as dangerous and harmful, and attributed many abnormal phenomena to "democracy," or used "democracy" to continue to oppress soldiers, such as a certain company commander calling on everyone to "democratically discuss" how to beat a soldier. In this way, both cadres and soldiers complained about democracy. In order to change this situation, according to the army-building principles of the People's Liberation Army, on the one hand, the awareness of soldiers was raised, and at the same time, cadres were united and educated. The method was to correctly use democracy through various organizations and conference reporting systems, ensure that human rights were not violated, so that lower-level soldiers dared to put forward opinions, and at the same time respect and obey the correct discipline of cadres. On the other hand, cadres were educated and helped to abandon the warlordist attitude, abolish beatings and scoldings, humbly listen to the opinions of subordinates, review and correct their own mistakes, respect the personality of soldiers, and carry out criticism and self-criticism.
    Now, in some troops, due to the correct use of democracy, the thinking of both cadres and soldiers has been improved, officer-soldier relations have been improved, and there is a new atmosphere in the troops. For example, a certain division is a better unit in carrying out democracy. During the production period, the division carried out democratic education and a discipline rectification campaign, and after democratic evaluation of profit sharing and selection of models, it reversed the original demoralized, low-spirited, and chaotic emotions, and brought out the enthusiasm of the soldiers and strengthened their sense of ownership. They said: "It was wrong to be a soldier in the past, but it is glorious to be a soldier now." After the implementation of the democratic system, officers also felt that it was easier to lead soldiers and believed that the democratic system was good.
    The direction for the future
    In the past year, although the Suiyuan uprising troops have made the above-mentioned achievements, as General Dong Qiwu said: "The progress of our troops is like planting trees. Although they have sprouted and grown leaves, they have not yet taken root and cannot withstand wind and rain." Now, in addition to checking and summarizing the work of the past year during the September 19th anniversary, the troops will generally combine the establishment of various systems of the People's Liberation Army and military training work this winter to carry out political education and ideological education. Now, all officers and soldiers are welcoming the upcoming further military training, production, and ideological education work with enthusiasm and confidence, in order to become a strong People's Liberation Army.

　　绥远起义部队在前进中
    新民
    胜利完成整编，树立解放军的各种制度。
    绥远去年“九一九”起义的部队，在毛主席团结一致，力求进步，改革旧制度，实行新政策的方针下，在傅作义、董其武诸将军的努力擘划下，一年来有了显著的进步。原起义部队的指挥机关，系于去年十二月与人民解放军绥远军区合并。今年元旦，合编后的新的领导机关——绥远军区宣告成立，担当起领导起义部队团结改造工作的任务。今年一月，绥远军区以傅、董二将军为首召集了起义部队军、师、旅长及准备派到起义部队的军、师级政治干部，举办了高级干部研究班，在两周内对人民解放军的性质、建军原则及政治工作制度等作了认真研究。二月初，军区召开高干会议，通过了起义部队整编方案。二月下旬，开始建立军、师、团各级政治机关。四月上旬，各部整编大体完成。军区又先后召开了参谋、供给、卫生工作等会议，在部队中树立起人民解放军的各种制度。四月中旬，各部相继投入大生产。在生产期中，初步建立了人民解放军的各种民主制度，改造部队思想，改善官兵和军民关系，有了显著的进步。在部队不断进步的基础上，完成了种地十一万余亩，修渠打坝二百零二万三千余公方的任务（按六月底以前计算）。
    改造思想，走人民的道路。
    提高对新民主主义的认识，改造旧思想，成了起义部队的热潮。各机关部队的在职干部，都实行了每天两小时学习的制度。军区并办了军政干部学习团，各军各师也举办了短期轮训队。
    一年来大家学习了社会发展史和时事政策，干部中所曾经存在的疑虑，如担心共产党人轻视和打击他们，采取不前不后、不进步也不反动等观望态度已经大体消除。学习团三大队第一期分配工作时，某班全体给学习团干部写信，决心要全心全意为人民服务，保证回队后做好工作，对人民有害的事一件不做，对人民有益的事尽量去做，他们并且确实这样做了。骑兵某团团长曾经在一九四八年袭击过冀中的河间，过去这样做是为了执行命令，他在学习的过程中，认识了自己这样做对不起人民，经过几次激烈的内心斗争，自动地交出了国民党复兴社等反动组织证件和私藏的三支手枪。他看了电影《中华儿女》后惭痛地落了眼泪。他又写了个决心书，要在今后的工作中立功赎罪。某师一个连长，学习前满怀疑虑，工作消沉，想拉杆了当土匪去。经过学习回到连队后，他便召集全连士兵，当众检讨了过去打骂士兵，吃空额的错误行为，保证再不重犯。他检查了本连的武器弹药和人员马匹花名册，把“空额”报到团部呈请取消。他为执行新的制度，集中起伙（过去是分伙的），改善士兵生活，便拿出旧日的积蓄，买了七口锅，一百个碗，建立连队家务。他开始经常地找战士个别谈话，问寒问暖。每早起来，并亲自担水扫院。
    许多起义干部从经过学习改造，打破了怀疑，批判和否定了自己的过去，心悦诚服地愿为新民主主义奋斗，重新确定走人民的道路。在学习团一大队的一千零六十九人中，自动坦白反动党派关系的有五百二十五人，坦白特务关系的有七十人，交出私藏证件、枪枝、电讯器材等九十四件。同时有八十四人被评为学习模范，一百零五人加入了新民主主义青年团。由于思想上的进步，使许多起义干部表现了虚心学习，努力工作，积极参加生产的新作风和新气象。
    部队中的民主制逐步建立
    各级政治机关和政治工作建立以后，就开始建立团以上的军政委员会，连营的军政小组及在连队中建立经济组、政工组、学习组、讨论会、评比会及其他会议汇报等民主制度。并一般地废除了打骂制度，改善士兵政治地位，提高战士觉悟，巩固部队。
    实施上述民主制度过程中，开始曾发生过不少问题。战士中认为解放了，民主了，要翻身。要报复，但也不敢出头露面。而干部则是害怕民主，把民主看成是危险的和有害的，把许多不正常的现象推到“民主”身上。或利用“民主”来继续压迫士兵，如某连长召集大家“民主讨论”如何打一个战士的板子。这样干部战士双方都对民主发生了怨言。为了改变这种情况，便根据人民解放军的建军原则，一方面提高士兵的觉悟，同时团结教育干部。方法是通过各种组织和会议汇报制度，正确运用民主，保证人权不受侵犯，使下级士兵敢提意见，同时尊重与服从干部的正确管教。另一方面教育帮助干部放弃军阀主义态度，废除打骂，虚心倾听下级意见，检讨与改正自己的错误，尊重士兵人格，并开展批评与自我批评。
    现在有些部队，因正确运用民主，干部战士的思想都提高了一步，改善了官兵关系，部队中有了新的气象。如某师开展民主是较好的单位，该师在生产期中进行了民主教育和整饬纪律运动，又经过民主评议分红和评选模范，把原来士气涣散、低落、混乱的情绪扭转过来，发挥了战士的积极性，加强了主人翁的感觉。他们说：“过去当兵冤枉，现在当兵光荣。”在实行民主制度以后，官长也感到兵好带了，认为民主制度好。
    今后的方向
    一年来，绥远起义部队，虽然有了上述的成绩，但也正如董其武将军所说：“我们部队的进步，正如栽的树，虽然已经生芽长叶了，但还未扎稳根，还经不起风吹雨打。”现在部队除趁九一九纪念的日子，检查总结一年工作外，将在今冬普遍地结合建立人民解放军的各种制度和练兵工作，展开政治教育与思想教育。现在全体官兵，正以热情和信心，迎接即将到来的进一步的练兵、生产和思想教育工作，以期成为一支坚强的人民解放军。
