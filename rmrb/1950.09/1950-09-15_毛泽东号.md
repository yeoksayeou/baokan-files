　　Mao Zedong Locomotive (Serialized Novella)
    By Ding Kexin and Qingying
    Twenty-Six: The World Has Changed

　　After the re-division of shifts, Shang Baoheng saw that Wang Qingquan and Yang Daofang were working especially hard, and were very honest, listening to every word and respecting him in every way. There was no way to say anything bad about them.

　　Guo Shude initially consulted him on technical problems twice, which made him feel a little awkward. He thought that this was just political work, and that they didn't really respect him. But Guo Shude consulted with the old hero on problems and solved them together. That time, he was also sincere and earnest, and there was no hint of pretense. As time went on, Lao Shang slowly felt that Guo Shude was indeed a good person in dealing with matters and people, qualified to be a Communist Party member. Even the two young Party members really had nothing to criticize. …

　　Lao Zheng was not clear about Lao Shang's thoughts. He thought that Lao Shang would not be convinced by Guo Shude anyway, because he himself looked down on Guo Shude for becoming a driver at such a young age. Once, on the way back to Harbin from Yimianpo, the switchman at Acheng Station asked them to switch the train, and he deliberately cursed:

　　"Damn it, if I were driving, I wouldn't switch for him!"

　　Guo Shude said nothing and carefully switched the train. Lao Zheng came back and excitedly told Lao Shang about it, but Lao Shang said:

　　"Don't curse people like that again!"

　　"Are you afraid of being criticized at the meeting! I don't care!"

　　But Lao Shang didn't say anything else. Lao Zheng thought: "You're all soft, just watch me!"

　　Sure enough, when they arrived at Acheng again and had to switch the train, he confronted the people at the station directly:

　　"You sleep comfortably at night, but you have to switch trains during the day. What responsibility do you bear?"

　　The people at the station said with a smile:

　　"Come on, you are model workers, we want to learn from your Mao Zedong Locomotive..."

　　This time Guo Shude immediately criticized him:

　　"Lao Zheng, that's not right. What are you afraid of doing a little more? How embarrassing is it to be laughed at?"

　　"Well, I—"

　　Lao Zheng was about to retort, but Sun Changxin spoke up:

　　"What are you 'umming' about? You're making the whole train lose face. How glorious is that for you!"

　　Since being in the same shift as Guo Shude, Sun Changxin saw that Guo Shude was extraordinarily careful and worked hard, and usually constantly explained problems and told them revolutionary principles, and he secretly admired him more and more. Seeing Lao Zheng arguing randomly time and again, he became dissatisfied.

　　Lao Zheng twisted his neck and said:

　　"You landlord are scolding me!" Sun Changxin was tall and big, and people jokingly called him a landlord.

　　Lao Sun glared his eyes and said very seriously:

　　"Don't call me 'landlord' randomly! Who is a landlord?"

　　Seeing that Sun Changxin was really opposing him, and knowing that he was wrong, Lao Zheng softened.

　　Then, at another group meeting, Sun Changxin brought up these two things again. Yang Daofang, Wang Qingquan, the old hero, Hu Chundong, and Xiao Zhu all spoke to criticize him.

　　Some said:

　　"It's wrong to curse people when you don't want to switch the train!"

　　Some said:

　　"We work for the people and for the revolution, not for any one person."

　　Some even said:

　　"Lao Zheng always likes to be lazy and play tricks, making fun of people and cursing people; it has a bad impact on the Mao Zedong Locomotive, and it's not good for himself either."

　　Seeing that everyone was dissatisfied with him, which was very different from before, and that the world had changed, Lao Zheng did not dare to say anything more and was sweating profusely.

　　Finally, Guo Shude said:

　　"Although Lao Zheng has these shortcomings, we can't completely blame him. We all came from the old society, and everyone has some problems. In the past, we also lacked mutual criticism and mutual help, otherwise, I believe Lao Zheng would have corrected these shortcomings long ago. Lao Zheng doesn't need to be sad, everyone is criticizing you for your own good!"

　　At this time, Shang Baoheng said:

　　"I, Lao Shang, most agree with what Driver Guo said! Lao Zheng," he looked at him, "it's nothing, from now on, just follow the crowd."

　　Zheng Dugong wiped his sweat, his face burning, squeezing his eyelids, with some tears in the corners of his eyes, as if he was about to cry. (Attached image)

### 毛泽东号

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作
    二十六、天下变了
    重新编班以后，商宝恒看王清权、杨道芳的工作特别卖力，而且都很老实，说一句听一句，处处对他很尊敬。这些，怎么说也不能说人家不好。
    郭树德开头两次向他请教技术问题，他感到有点蹩扭。他想，这是做政治工作哩，并非真心看得起他。可是郭树德一遇到问题就和老英雄找他商量共同解决，那一次也是诚诚恳恳的，真心实意的，看不出一点虚假来。日子久了，老商慢慢觉得郭树德这人处事待人确乎不赖（不错），够共产党员的资格。就说两个小青年党员吧，也实在没有叫人挑剔的地方。……
    老郑对老商的心思是不清楚的，他以为反正老商是不会信服郭树德的，因为他自己就看不起郭树德年青青的就当上司机。有一次从一面坡回哈尔滨，到阿城站时调车员要他们调车，他就有意胡乱骂起来：
    “他妈的，要是我开车就不给他调！”
    郭树德没有说什么，认真的把车调好了。老郑回来就兴冲冲的把这事告诉老商，那知道老商说道：
    “以后可不要再这样乱骂人！”
    “你是怕开会检讨你吧！我可不在乎！”
    可是老商竟没有再说什么。老郑想：“你们一个一个都松包吧，看我的！”
    果然，又一次到阿城又要调车，他就当面向站上的人顶起来：
    “晚上你们睡舒服觉，偏要白天调车，你们负的什么责任？”
    站上的人笑着说：
    “得了，你们是模范，我们要向你们毛泽东号学习哪。……”
    这次郭树德立刻就批评他：
    “老郑，这不对，多干点怕什么，叫人家笑话咱们有多难看？”
    “嗯，我——”
    老郑正要回搅，没想到孙长信开口了：
    “你嗯什么，叫全车都跟着你丢人，你可真光彩！”
    孙长信自从和郭树德一班以后，看郭树德工作分外经心努力，平时又不断的和他们解释问题，讲革命道理，暗暗地就对他越来越佩服，见老郑两次三番的胡乱吵，也就不满意起来。
    老郑脖子一扭道：
    “你大地主也训我呀！”孙长信个儿长的高大，人们都笑称他大地主。
    老孙瞪起两眼很认真地说：
    “别大地主大地主的乱叫！谁是大地主？”
    老郑见孙长信真的反对起他来，又知道自己并没有理，就软下来了。
    接着在另一次小组会上，孙长信又把这两件事提出来，杨道芳、王清权、老英雄、胡春东和小朱，都发言批评了他。
    有的说：
    “不愿意调车还骂人，太不对！”
    有的说：
    “咱们是为人民为革命工作，不是为哪一个人。”
    有的甚至说：
    “老郑总爱偷个懒耍个滑，调调皮骂骂人；对毛泽东号影响不好，对他自己也不好。”
    老郑一看大家都不满意他，和以前大不相同了，天下变了，就没有敢再说什么，蹩了一头大汗。
    临末郭树德说了：
    “老郑虽然有这些缺点，可是也不能全怪他。咱们都是从旧社会里来的，谁都有些毛病。以前大家也缺少互相批评互相帮助，要不然，我相信老郑早就把这些缺点改了。老郑也不必难过，大家批评你都是为了你好！”
    这时商宝恒说道：
    “郭大车这话我老商最赞成！老郑，”他看了看他：“没有什么的，从今以后，跟着大伙走就是了。”
    郑笃恭抹着汗，脸发烧，挤着眼皮，眼角上有些泪水，似乎快要掉下来的样子。（附图片）
