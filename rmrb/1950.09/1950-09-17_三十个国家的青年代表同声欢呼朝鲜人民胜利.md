　　Youth Representatives from Thirty Countries Cheer for the Victory of the Korean People

　　On the morning of September 15th, the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth inspected a grand youth welcoming procession in Shenyang. In front of the towering Tower for the Defense of World Peace, youth representatives from various countries and youth from Shenyang expressed international youth's solidarity and friendship. A wave of cheers rose from the huge youth procession.

　　After the welcoming ceremony, Korean youth representative and combat hero Quan Zonghuan met with youth representatives from thirty countries, presenting the most moving scene of international youth unity. American female youth representative Weiss immediately ran up to embrace Quan Zonghuan upon seeing him, and said enthusiastically, "We have been looking forward to meeting you all the way." Quan Zonghuan said, "I am equally excited because our Korean people and the American people are fighting the same enemy." The Korean and American youth spoke warmly of their common suffering and victory. Another American youth representative, Mark An, also ran up and shook hands firmly with Quan Zonghuan, saying, "The American people and the Korean people are fighting side by side against the American aggressors. American youth are mobilizing all their strength to demand the withdrawal of American troops and oppose the aggression against Korea." Youth representatives from various countries came to shake hands with the Korean representatives, congratulating them on the victory of the Korean people. The meeting between the Korean and Vietnamese representatives was a meeting of the youth of brotherly countries that are marching towards victory in the national liberation war. Youth representatives from various countries cheered for them. The Korean youth representative was a battalion chief of staff, and the Vietnamese youth representative was a regimental chief of staff. These two heroes, who had been tempered by war, congratulated each other on early liberation and early victory. Quan Zonghuan said, "Entrusted by the Korean people and youth, I pay tribute to the Vietnamese youth, because we are standing together on the front line against aggression." The Vietnamese youth representative said enthusiastically, "The Vietnamese people and the Korean people are fighting for national freedom and independence. We are common comrades-in-arms with the same goals." The Soviet youth representative also repeatedly expressed heartfelt congratulations to Quan Zonghuan. Youth representatives from the Netherlands, Italy, Canada, the United Kingdom and other countries told the Korean youth representatives how they were using concrete actions to support the just struggle of the Korean people. The British youth representative said, "I have brought many declarations and pamphlets from British progressives and youth against American aggression against Korea. I hope you will take them back to Korea and tell the Korean people about the will of the British people to oppose American aggression against Korea." Quan Zonghuan thanked the youth representatives of these countries and said, "When we heard the news at home that Dutch workers, British youth, and Australian dockworkers refused to transport military supplies and supported the struggle of the Korean people, we became even more convinced that the just struggle of the Korean people, with the strong support of the people of the world, will surely achieve complete victory."

　　Quan Zonghuan ran to the Soviet youth representative and shook hands with the Soviet youth representative again. He said, "Korea has been able to achieve such accomplishments in construction today, and the Korean people have been able to severely hit the enemy, thanks to the liberation of Korea by the Soviet Red Army led by Stalin in 1945. Korea would not have had today's victory without the liberation by the Soviet army. The entire Korean people and youth express their gratitude to the Soviet people for their righteous act of supporting the Korean people's just struggle."

　　When the representatives sat down to talk, Weiss, who was sitting with Quan Zonghuan, saw Quan Zonghuan take out an American-made military knife to peel a pear, and asked where the knife came from. Quan Zonghuan told her that the Korean People's Army not only captured American knives, but also countless heavy artillery and tanks. The Korean People's Army now calls Truman the "Chief Quartermaster of Military Supplies." Weiss smiled and said, "The lessons Truman has learned are not enough. The Korean People's Army calls him the 'Chief Quartermaster,' and the Chinese people call him a 'paper tiger,' which is completely justified." The hall was filled with pleasant conversations and triumphant laughter.

### 三十个国家的青年代表同声欢呼朝鲜人民胜利

　　三十个国家的青年代表同声欢呼朝鲜人民胜利
    九月十五日清晨，世界青联代表团在沈阳市检阅了盛大的青年欢迎行列，在矗立的保卫世界和平塔前，世界各国青年代表和沈阳市青年互相表达了国际青年的团结和友爱。巨大的青年行列中，响起了一片欢呼的声浪。
    欢迎会后，朝鲜青年代表战斗英雄全宗焕和三十个国家的青年代表会师了，表现出国际青年之间最动人的场面。美国女青年代表魏斯一看到全宗焕，立刻跑上去拥抱他，并且热情地说：“我们一路就盼着和你会面。”全宗焕说：“我也同样地兴奋，因为我们朝鲜人民和美国人民正在和同一的敌人作斗争。”朝鲜青年和美国青年亲切地诉说着共同的苦难和胜利。另一个美国青年代表马克安也跑上来和全宗焕紧紧地握手，他说：“美国人民和朝鲜人民正在并肩战斗反对美国侵略者，美国青年正动员一切力量要求撤回美军，反对侵略朝鲜。”各国青年代表都走拢来和朝鲜代表握手，为朝鲜人民的胜利祝贺。朝鲜代表和越南代表的晤面，是正在走向民族解放战争胜利的兄弟国家青年的会师，各国青年代表为他们欢呼。朝鲜青年代表是营参谋长，越南青年代表是团参谋长，这两位久经战火锻炼的英雄，互相祝贺早日解放，早日胜利。全宗焕说：“我受朝鲜人民和青年的委托，向越南青年致敬，因为我们正一同站在反侵略的最前线。”越南青年代表热情地说：“越南人民和朝鲜人民正在为民族自由独立而战，我们是目标一致的共同战友。”苏联青年代表也向全宗焕再三表示衷心的祝贺。荷、意、加、英等国青年代表都纷纷告诉朝鲜青年代表，他们如何用具体的行动支援朝鲜人民的正义斗争。英国青年代表说：“我带来许多英国进步人士和青年反对美国侵略朝鲜的宣言和小册子，希望你带回朝鲜，告诉朝鲜人民关于英国人民反对美国侵略朝鲜的意志。”全宗焕向这些国家的青年代表致谢，并且说：“我们在国内听到荷兰工人、英国青年、澳大利亚码头工人拒运军火和声援朝鲜人民斗争的消息时，越发坚信在世界人民有力支援下的朝鲜人民的正义斗争，一定可以获得完全的胜利。”
    全宗焕跑到苏联青年代表面前，又一次和苏联青年代表握手，他说：“朝鲜在建设方面能有今天这样的成就，朝鲜人民能够严重地打击敌人，这是斯大林领导的苏联红军在一九四五年解放朝鲜的结果。朝鲜没有苏军的解放就没有今天的胜利。对于苏联人民声援朝鲜人民正义斗争的义举，全朝鲜人民和青年都表示谢意。”
    当代表们坐下说话时，和全宗焕坐在一起的魏斯，看到了全宗焕拿出美制的军用小刀削梨，便问这小刀的来源。全宗焕告诉了她：朝鲜人民军不仅缴获了美军的小刀，而且缴获了无数的巨炮和坦克。朝鲜人民军现在都喊杜鲁门为“军火运输大队长”了。魏斯笑着说：“杜鲁门所受的教训还是不够的，朝鲜人民军喊他为‘运输队长’，中国人民喊他是‘纸老虎’，完全是有道理的。”大厅里到处是愉快的谈话和胜利的笑声。
