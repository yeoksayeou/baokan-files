　　Wang Qi and the Daizhaoling Supply and Marketing Cooperative
　　I. Wang Qi is not afraid of difficulties and is determined to run the village supply and marketing cooperative well.
　　Daizhaoling is an administrative village in the fifth district of Wu乡, with nine natural villages under its jurisdiction, a total of 159 households, 536 people, and 3,325 mu of cultivated land. The village cooperative was established in 1945. At that time, 190 shares were raised, with a share capital of 8,000 yuan (冀钞, Ji currency). A group of people got together with the masses, and three cadres were selected to set up a 평机 (píng jī, weaving machine), start a workshop, and engage in business. Because the cooperative cadres were divorced from the masses and engaged in corruption and waste, the business could not be developed after three years, which aroused dissatisfaction among the masses. The original shares of struggle fruits were all distributed, and the purchased furniture occupied the funds, which could not be turned over. As a result, external debts could not be repaid, and external debts could not be recovered. The members reflected that it was a "living capture society" and a "eating society". The cadres also retreated.
　　In October 1947, Comrade Wang Qi came to lead the cooperative. When he first arrived at the cooperative, he was unfamiliar with the work, the village cadres ignored him, external debts could not be recovered, funds could not be turned over, and the masses looked down on him. However, Comrade Wang Qi was not afraid of difficulties and was determined to reverse the village cooperative's image in the minds of the masses. He reduced one cadre and saved money himself, using the method of "diligence in buying, selling, and running errands" to solve the cooperative's financial difficulties. He carried a carrying pole, got up early and went to bed late, and picked up some supplies from other places to supply the masses cheaply. He also took the initiative to contact the fifth district cooperative and adhered to his credit, gaining the trust of the district cooperative and daring to give goods on credit. Therefore, the business gradually expanded. After a year of hard work, he returned three shi of millet in external debt and distributed a dividend of 6.3 yuan per yuan, restoring the village cooperative's credit and laying the foundation for later transformation.
　　II. Enthusiastically serving the masses, supply and marketing business gradually developed
　　In April 1949, Wang Qi returned from the county and publicized the benefits of running a supply and marketing cooperative. The masses ignored him. The women said, "Blind Wang Qi, what can the cooperative do? You say the supply and marketing cooperative can serve the masses, so please handle the missing spindles for our spinning wheels!" Wang Qi said, "Let's try it. If it's done well, it's the cooperative's merit. If it's not done well, it's because I'm incompetent." He immediately investigated the required numbers and went to the nearby Duan Village market to buy 50 spindles, which were supplied to the women. They were both cheap and easy to use, and the women were all satisfied. The men said, "There is a shortage of agricultural tools and fertilizers for spring plowing." When Wang Qi heard this, he quickly invited Old Hu, an old blacksmith from Lin County (who had long been trusted by the masses), to repair and make 450 pieces of agricultural tools for the village and solve 1,400 jin of fertilizer. Everyone was happy. The women said, "The cooperative can also do things. This year, we don't have to worry about not having cloth shirts." The men said, "It's not that the cooperative is bad, it's that the people who ran it in the past were not good. Wang Qi can do things, so let's run the cooperative well!"
　　Just at this time, the county cooperative allocated a batch of necessities such as sea salt, towels, and baskets (agricultural tools for loading soil). The masses saw that these goods were both cheaper and more convenient than those at the Duan Village market, so they all rushed to buy them. Wang Qi seized the opportunity to publicize and mobilize everyone to run the supply and marketing cooperative together. He also cleared up the four-year old accounts and posted the list on the street. The villagers all scrambled to read it. Five people said, "We shouldn't owe the cooperative money that we owe." They immediately paid the money voluntarily. The village cooperative praised them on the blackboard newspaper and mobilized everyone to pay their debts. Within a few days, all external debts were recovered.
　　In May, the village cooperative decided to supply the masses with salt, cotton, and sesame cakes on time in exchange for the members' grain. In July, it seized the season to sell 70 shi of wheat. Last winter, Wang Qi accepted the spirit of the production and marketing conference. Relying on the county cooperative, he adhered to the principle of "what the masses have, we promote; what the masses want, we get." He used the method of ordering contracts to get back 310 jin of cotton, 160 chi of cloth, and other miscellaneous goods from the county cooperative to supply the members in exchange for large hemp and millet to the county cooperative. Not only did he complete the winter material exchange task, but he also met the needs of the members. In the middle of sending grain, he also organized nine transport carts, earning 28 shi of rice. The members said, "The cooperative is really our family business."
　　III. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various villages exchange experiences, and the Daizhaoling village cooperative is praised
　　At the beginning of spring plowing this year, the cooperative responded to the government's call and mobilized the masses to grow cotton. However, because the masses have never had the habit of growing cotton, Wang Qi used the method of comparing the accounts of growing cotton and growing grain to get through their thinking and mobilized 20 households to grow 20 mu of cotton, supplying 131 jin of cotton seeds. He also adjusted four dou of high-quality grain seeds as a trial planting experiment and led the Shi Bingxu mutual aid group to mix the seeds with white wine and kill insects with black alum, supplying 11.5 jin of white wine and 11 jin of black alum. He also supplied the members with baskets and a plough, with a total value of 519,700 yuan. During the wheat harvest season, Wang Qi considered that the members would delay work in buying goods during the busy farming season, and small vendors would inevitably take advantage of the opportunity to speculate. Therefore, he carried goods to the countryside and supplied and marketed them door-to-door. Through mobile supply and marketing, he promoted the establishment of supply and marketing groups in various natural villages, and the group leaders absorbed reflections, counted needs, and supplied them on time. In the past six months, he has supplied the members with daily necessities such as salt, cotton, white paper, cloth, towels, and matches, with a total value of 9,946,470 yuan. Sales of surplus products: grain, melon seeds, eggs, wool, hemp, and part of apricot kernels and rope ends, with a total value of 6,309,000 yuan. The total value of supply and marketing is 16,775,170 yuan. The turnover of working capital in half a year reached as many as 13 times. The transaction volume with the county cooperative was 16,348,970 yuan, accounting for 97.4% of the total transaction volume. He was able to rely on the county cooperative from above and the members from below, without depositing money in the cabinet, and the capital turnover was rapid. Therefore, this year, the county cooperative held a representative meeting of cooperatives to exchange work experience. The Daizhaoling village cooperative was praised by everyone. More than a dozen village cooperatives, such as Xiaoliang, Guangzhi, and Laoao, shouted the slogan: "Follow Wang Qi's direction." The county cooperative also praised him, saying, "He goes to the market, delivers grain, and carries goods to the countryside, becoming a strong assistant to the county cooperative."
　　Last autumn, the members automatically deposited grain, and the cooperative attached a credit department. This year, 13.4 shi of grain were deposited, and all of them were lent to 21 households before sowing (monthly interest of 1% for deposits and 2% for loans), most of which were used for production. Combining the masses' own funds to buy cattle and sheep, or repair houses, etc. At the end of spring, the loan households reflected that "the green and yellow are not connected and cannot be repaid." Wang Qi immediately convened a meeting of loan households, solicited the opinions of the loan households, and borrowed eight shi of millet from the bank to repay the depositors, and the loan households postponed the repayment until after the summer harvest. Some members said, "After the wheat is harvested this year, I will deposit all the surplus grain into the credit department after deducting the burden." Sure enough, after the wheat harvest, the amount of wheat deposited increased by 28.1 shi.
　　IV. Educating and enlightening members to implement democratic cooperative management
　　In addition to being hard-working, enthusiastic, and active, Wang Qi is also humble, meticulous, and good at listening to the opinions of the masses. Last autumn, the members realized that "the cooperative can really do things, but there is too little money and the shares should be increased." Wang Qi then proposed to expand the capital and increase the shares twice in succession. The number of members increased from 190 to 352, and each share increased from 3 sheng to 5 sheng, raising 17.6 shi of share capital. Moreover, in order to educate the members and enlighten them to run the cooperative democratically, he convened a members' meeting, summarized the achievements of supply and marketing, and calculated the accounts in detail, so that the members realized that the cooperative could solve their difficulties, save labor and money. On the basis of reviewing the reasons for the collapse of the cooperative in the past, a set of relatively complete democratic systems was formulated: it was determined not to distribute dividends, the members were divided into groups of ten, one representative was selected for every 25 people, and the representatives formed the cooperative committee, which met once every half month to study supply and marketing business. In advance, the members proposed the names and quantities of needed items, and the cooperative committee comprehensively organized the distribution according to their opinions; a meeting of members' representatives was convened once a month. In advance, the cooperative summarized the work of the previous month and formulated the plan for the next month, which was passed by the members' representatives for amendment and implemented as a resolution. In the first half of this year, Wang Qi not only made a work summary report to the members' congress (attended by group leaders), but also focused on commending the villages (Qinglongnao, Xiaoxindian) that complied with the system and the particularly enthusiastic people (Shi Bingxu, Wu Zhicheng, etc.). The representatives put forward three opinions at the meeting: (1) There is no in-depth leadership, creation of experience, and improvement of technology in organizing production. (This point should be studied and improved by the technical committee and the mutual aid group, and the cooperative can provide assistance in the supply and marketing of medicines, machinery, and agricultural tools.) (2) The village cooperative's business must strengthen planning, and some of the work is not enough. In summer, the members wanted 15 wooden hoes, but only eight were supplied. (3) The capital is 17.6 shi, the furniture occupies 5 shi, the county cooperative invests 7 shi, and the working capital is only 5.6 dou. It is necessary to increase the shares and expand the capital. Wang Qi immediately accepted the opinions, and everyone decided to increase the share amount from 5 sheng to 1 dou. According to statistics in less than ten days, the number of members increased by seven, and the newly added share capital was 10.65 shi of wheat.
　　At present, the members and village cadres enthusiastically support Wang Qi and cherish the supply and marketing cooperative. Last spring, during the busy farming season, the members automatically organized to farm for Wang Qi. This summer, a businessman sold matches in Taipingzhuang, Baicaoyan, and other villages, not only asking for high prices but also saying, "The matches of the supply and marketing cooperative are fake." When the members Wu Xiaobi and Wei Gailian (female) heard this, they retorted, "You can't insult the supply and marketing cooperative casually." Because of Comrade Wang Qi's own spirit of wholeheartedly serving the masses, and accepting the leadership of the county cooperative, he reversed the Daizhaoling supply and marketing cooperative from the past pure profit-making point of view and gradually developed the supply and marketing business. Because he effectively solved many problems for the masses, he was supported by the masses.

　　王杞和代照岭供销社
  一  王杞不怕困难，坚决要办好村供销社
    代照岭是武乡五区的一个行政村，所辖九个自然村，共一百五十九户，五百三十六人，耕地三、三二五亩。村社于一九四五年成立，当时凑集一百九十股，股金为八、○○○元（冀钞）。又结合群众一部门争果实，推出三个干部，置平机（即织布机），闹作坊，跑买卖。由于合作社干部脱离群众和贪污浪费，搞了三年，业务不能开展，结果引起群众不满，将原入股的斗争果实全部分去，所买家具占住资金，不能周转。遂形成欠外不能还，外欠收不起。社员反映是“活捉社”“吃干社”，干部也打了退堂鼓。
    一九四七年十月王杞同志来领导合作社，初到社内，工作不摸，村干部不理，外欠要不回，资金周转不开，群众瞧不起。但王杞同志不畏困难，坚决要扭转村社在群众中的印象。乃减去一个干部，自己省吃俭用，以“勤买勤卖勤跑腿”的办法，解决社内资金困难。一条扁担，起早搭黑，从外地挑些用品，便宜供给群众，并主动与五区区社联系，坚守信用，取得区社信任，敢于赊给货物，因此业务逐渐扩大，经过一年的辛苦经营，归还外欠小米三石，分红每元六元三角，挽回了村社信用，打下后来改造的基础。
  二  热心替群众办事，供销业务逐渐开展
    一九四九年四月，王杞从县上回来，宣传办理供销社的好处，群众不理，妇女们说：“瞎王杞，合作社能办啥事？你说供销社能为群众服务，现在我们纱车缺锭子，就替我们办办吧！”王杞说：“咱试试看，办好是合作社的功劳，办不好是咱没能耐。”当即调查好需要数字，跑到附近段村集上买回锭子五十只，供给妇女使用，既省钱又好使，妇女都满意，男人又说：“春耕缺乏农具肥料。”王杞听到反映急忙请来林县老胡（在群众中早有威信的老铁匠）到村修打农具四百五十件，并解决肥料一千四百斤，大家无不欢喜。妇女们说：“合作社也能办事，今年不愁没布衫啦。”男人们说：“不是合作社坏，是过去办的人不好，王杞能办事，咱们还是把合作社好好搞起来吧！”
    恰巧这时县社拨来一批海盐、毛巾、箩头（装土用的农具）等必需品，群众看到，这些货比段村集上既便宜，又方便，都争着来买。王杞便抓紧宣传，动员大家齐来办理供销社，并清理四年老账，拉出清单，贴到街上。村里人都争着看，有五个人说：“咱欠合作社的账，不应再欠不还”，当即自动交款；村社就在黑板报上表扬，动员大家还账，不几日外欠全数收起。
    五月村社确定按时供给群众食盐、棉花、麻饼，换取社员粮食。七月掌握季节推销小麦七十石。去年冬天王杞接受产销会议精神，依靠县社抱定“群众有啥咱推啥；群众要啥咱弄啥”的原则，用订合同办法从县社拿回棉花三百一十斤，布一百六十尺及其他零货供给社员，换交县社大麻和小米，不但完成了冬季物资交流任务，也满足了社员需要。送粮中间，并组织运输车九辆，赚米二十八石，社员们说：“合作社真是咱们的家业了。”
  三  各村供销社交流经验，代照岭村社受到赞扬
    今年春耕开始，合作社响应政府号召，发动群众种棉。但因群众历来没有种棉习惯，王杞便用种棉种粮对比算账打通思想，发动二十户种棉二十亩，供给棉籽一百三十一斤。并调剂优良谷种四斗作为试种实验，领导史炳旭互助组用白酒拌种，黑矾杀虫，供给白酒十一斤半，黑矾十一斤。又供给社员箩头，铧子一部，总值五一九、七○○元。麦收时节，王杞考虑农忙中社员买货误工，难免小贩钻空投机，乃担货下乡，上门供销，并通过流动供销，推动各自然村成立供销组，由组长吸收反映，统计需要，按时供给。半年来供给社员食盐、棉花、白纸、布匹、毛巾火柴等生活日用品，总值九、九四六、四七○元。推销剩余产品：粮食、瓜子、鸡蛋、羊毛、大麻及杏仁绳头一部总值六、三○九、○○○元，供销总值一六、七七五、一七○元，半年流动资金周转达十三次之多，与县社交易额一六、三四八、九七○元，占交易总额的百分之九七·四。作到上靠县社，下靠社员，柜内不存款，资金周转迅速。因此今年县社召开合作社代表会，交流工作经验，代照岭村社受到大家的赞扬，小良、广志、老凹等十余个村社喊出口号：“走王杞方向”，县社也称赞他说：“逢集赶集、送粮，背集担货下乡，成为县社的有力助手了。”
    去秋社员自动存粮，合作社附设了信贷部，今年存粮一三·四石，下种前全部贷给二十一户群众（月利存一分贷二分），大部用于生产，结合群众自己资金买牛、羊，或修房屋等。春末还粮日期，贷户反映“青黄不接还不上”。王杞即召开贷户会议，征求了贷户意见，另向银行贷小米八石，还给存户，贷户挪到夏收后归还。有的社员说：“今年打下麦子，除去负担，我把余粮全部存入信贷部”，果然麦收后增存小麦二八·一石。
  四  教育启发社员实行民主办社
    王杞除去吃苦耐劳，热心积极，而且虚心细致，善于听取群众意见。去秋社员体会“合作社真能办事，就是资金少，应该增股”。王杞便先后两次提出扩大资金增加股份，社员由一九○增至三五二，每股由三升增至五升，集起股金一七·六石。而且为了教育社员，启发社员民主办社，召开了社员大会，总结供销成绩，具体算账，使社员认识合作社能为他们解决困难，省工省钱。并从检讨过去合作社垮台的原因的基础上，订出一套较为完整的民主制度：确定不分红，社员十人编成一个小组，二十五人选一代表，由代表产生社委会，半月召开一次，研究供销业务，事先由社员提出需要品名数量，社委会综合意见组织配售；一月召集一次社员代表会，事先由社内总结上月工作，制定下月计划，通过社员代表提议修改，作为决议执行。今年前半年王杞不但向社代会（小组长参加）作了工作总结报告，而且着重表扬了遵守制度的村（青龙瑙、小新店）和特别热心的人（史炳旭、武志成等）。会上代表提出三点意见：（一）对组织生产上没有深入领导、创造经验、改进技术。（此点应由技术委员，和互助组研究提高，合作社可在药械、农具等供销上给予帮助。）（二）村社业务必须加强计划性，有些作的不够，夏天社员要木锨十五把，只供给了八把。（三）资金一七·六石，家具占五石，县社入股七石，流动资金只有五石六斗，必须增股扩大资金。王杞当即接受了意见，并由大家决定股额由五升增到一斗，据不到十天的统计，增加社员七人，新增股金麦子一○·六五石。
    目前，社员和村干无不热烈拥护王杞，爱护供销社。去春农忙，社员便自动组织，为王杞代耕，今夏一个商人在太平庄、白草烟等村卖火柴，不但索高价并且还说：“供销社的洋火是假的”，社员武小狊、魏改莲（女）听见，就反驳道：“你不能随便侮辱供销社。”由于王杞同志自己热心为群众服务的精神，接受县社的领导，扭转代照岭供销社由过去的单纯营利观点，逐步的发展了供销业务，因为切实为群众解决了许多问题，受到群众拥护。
