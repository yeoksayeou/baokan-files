　　Zheng Jinshan, Who Works Hard to Improve Tools
    ——An Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Peasants, and Soldiers, Part 7
    Wei Wanxian

　　Everyone in the Northwest Machinery Factory knows Zheng Jinshan.

　　He is bold, calm, and likes to delve into things. Having lived in the factory for a long time, he has become a well-informed and skilled veteran worker. He has rich experience in various technologies in machine factories, such as mold making, casting, machining, fitting, forging, riveting, and assembly; especially riveting and boiler manufacturing, which are his most proficient skills. Therefore, the workers praised him like this: "He can do ironwork, sand casting, and manages the whole workshop." However, before liberation, due to the oppression of the reactionary regime, he had to adopt an attitude of just trying to make a living, and he was unwilling to come forward in matters large or small, and the wisdom and creativity of the working class could not be brought into play for a long time.

　　After liberation, under the influence of the Party's correct policies, his work attitude quickly changed. Not long after liberation last year, the factory had not yet officially started work, and the factory was tasked with repairing cannons for a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army. Originally, this was not Lao Zheng's job, but he worked day and night with his fellow workers and successfully completed the glorious task of supporting the front. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted to Deputy Section Chief of the Manufacturing Section.

　　Because liberation gave him the possibility to display his talents and wisdom, he showed a series of exemplary deeds, constantly creating and improving tools, greatly improving work efficiency.

　　First, he created a safety hook for fine yarn spindle disks. The spindle part of the spinning frame has a set of safety hooks. In the past, its base was made of cast iron, which was easily damaged. The Second Northwest Textile Factory suggested using iron plates for manufacturing, which was strong but too costly. Zheng Jinshan designed a new style, still using cast iron, which was not only strong but also saved labor and materials. According to past material records, it is estimated that making ten spinning frames can save labor and material costs of six thousand real units. The improved safety hook has been tested by the Second Northwest Textile Factory and found to be better than the old style and easier to operate.

　　Second, he collaborated with technician Zhang Chunzheng to design a casting iron water ladle. In the past, the castings in the factory's foundry, regardless of size, were poured with molten iron by manpower. When pouring castings weighing more than one ton, although the iron water ladle was hung on a crane, it still required ten people to hold the handle of the iron water ladle and pry it with levers to pour out the molten iron, which was both labor-intensive and extremely dangerous. He assisted technician Zhang Chunzheng in designing a new and large iron water ladle with a maximum capacity of two and a half tons. Its mechanical principle is to use a figure-eight wheel to drive the worm nut and turbine. The turbine is connected to the iron water ladle. Now, only two people need to apply twenty pounds of force to the sixteen-inch handwheel to pour out two tons of molten iron. The manufacturing of this iron water ladle not only saves eight people's labor but also increases the safety of the workers.

　　Third, he joined forces with Zhang Chunzheng to repair the crane in the foundry. The five-ton crane in the factory's sand turning yard was originally pulled by manpower using a pulley. The weight of the crane was entirely borne by the four wheels. The assembly of the wheels and axles was very rough, and coupled with poor lubrication, even an empty car required five or six people to pull it. After he and technician Zhang Chunzheng worked together to modify it, the wheels, gears, and other rotating parts were modified to use roller bearings, the axles were replaced, and good lubricating oil was used. Now, although the crane is lifting several tons of weight, only one person can pull it at a fast speed.

　　Fourth, he is currently designing and suggesting the manufacture of an arc-shaped flat plate machine with a pressurized tin-lined shroud. This machine can solve the problem that the factory has not overcome for many years in making steel wire machines – the tin-lined shroud is not precise – which greatly improves the quality.

　　Fifth, the cover strips on the steel wire machine are extremely prone to bending during sand casting, and before liberation, the scrap rate due to bending reached more than 50%. To avoid this loss, he specially designed a cover strip straightening machine, which can turn scrapped cover strips into useful ones.

　　In addition, he is currently designing a milling cover strip machine, a cover strip punching machine, a cover plate tapping machine, and a steel collar ring polishing machine. These machines, if successfully tested in the future, will have a very important effect on production.

　　Although Lao Zheng has excellent technology and rich experience, he is never arrogant. "Skills are passed on to sons, not to worthy men" is a conservative style left over from the old society by technicians, but he often takes the initiative to point out technical errors and shortcomings to all technicians and apprentices; when others ask him, he is always amiable and patient in explaining. Therefore, he has established a high prestige among the masses. For example, the tool for making rocking comb pieces made by technician Yao Yintan was not easy to use, so he discussed it with Lao Zheng. Lao Zheng patiently explained to Yao: "I am willing to help more, but I don't want to do everything myself, otherwise, it will not be beneficial to the improvement of your skills. I hope you spend more time thinking and draw another picture, and I will modify it for you." With Zheng's specific help, Yao successfully modified the rocking comb piece. Zheng Jinshan often says: To do a good job in production, only the close unity of older technical workers and young workers is needed. This sentence is absolutely correct.

　　努力改进工具的郑金山
    ——工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之七
    魏万显
    提起郑金山来，西北机器厂里人人都知道。
    他胆大、沉着、好钻研。由于长期生活在工厂中，他变成了一个百事通的熟练老工人。对于机器工厂的各种技术诸如模、铸、机、钳、锻、铆、装配等，都有丰富的经验；尤其是铆工及锅炉制造，更是他最精通的业务。因此工友们这样称赞他：“打铁带翻砂，车间都管抓。”但解放前由于反动政权的压迫，他只得抱着混饭吃的态度，大小事情都不愿出头露面，工人阶级的智慧与创造性长期不得发挥。
    解放后，在党的正确政策影响下，他的工作态度很快就转变过来了。去年刚解放不久，厂中尚未正式开工，该厂担负了为解放军某部修理大炮的任务。本来这不是老郑份内的事，但他不分昼夜，帮着工友一块干，胜利地完成了支前的光荣任务。此后不久，他就被提升为制造科副科长了。
    由于解放后给予他发挥才能与智慧的可能，他就表现了一连串模范事迹，不断创造与改进工具，大大提高工作效率。
    第一、创造了细纱锭盘保险钩——精纺机的锭子部分有一套保险钩，它的底盘以往是用生铁作的，很易损坏，西纺二厂建议改用铁板制造，虽然坚固，但成本过高。经郑金山另设计了一种新的式样，仍用生铁作，这样不但坚固，而且省工省料，根据过去工料纪录估计，每作十部精纺机即可节省工料费六千个折实单位。此种改良后的保险钩，经西纺二厂试验结果，较旧式效用好，操作也容易。
    第二、协同技术员张纯正设计铸工铁水包——过去该厂铸工场的铸件，无论大小，都是用人力倒铁水，遇到浇铸一吨以上的铸件时，虽然铁水包挂在吊车上，但仍需十个人拿住铁水包的把子用杠子撬着，才能把铁水倒出来，既费人力，又极危险。经他协助技术员张纯正设计了一个新而大的铁水包，最大容量两吨半，其机动原理系利用八字轮来传动涡母和涡轮，涡轮是和铁水包相连的，现在只需两个人用二十磅的力量作用于十六英寸的手轮上，就能把两吨的铁水倒出来。这个铁水包的制造，不但可节省八个人力，而且增加了工友的安全。
    第三、与张纯正合力修好铸工场的吊车——该厂翻砂场的五吨吊车，原是由人力拉着道轮走。吊车的重量，完全负担在四个轮子上。轮子和轮轴的装配非常粗糙，加以滑润不好，即是空车，也要五、六人才能拉动。经他和技术员张纯正合力修改，把轮子、齿轮等各种转动部分改用滚轴配合，换了车轴，并利用良好的滑油润滑，现在吊车上虽然吊着几吨重的重量，但只需一个人就可拉着飞跑了。
    第四、由他的设计及建议正在制造中的有压锡林围板的弧形平板机，此机可以解决该厂所作钢丝机多年来的没有克服的问题——锡林围板不精确——使质量大为提高。
    第五、钢丝机上的盖条，在翻砂时极易发生弯曲，解放前因弯曲报废的达百分之五十以上。为了避免此种损失，他特别设计了一种盖条调直机，可以使报废的盖条变为有用。
    此外他正在设计中的有铣盖条机，盖条打眼机、盖板攻丝机、钢领圈打光机等，这些机器在将来试验成功后，对于生产上的作用，将会是非常重要的。
    老郑虽有很好的技术和丰富的经验，但他从来不自傲。“手艺传子不传贤”是旧社会技术人员遗留下来的保守作风，但他经常主动地给所有的技工及学徒们指正技术上的错误及缺点；当别人询问他时，他一贯是和蔼地耐心地解释。所以他在群众中建立了很高的威信。例如：技工姚荫坦做了一个摇梳片工具不好使用，就和老郑商量。老郑耐心的给姚解释说：“我愿多加帮助，不愿一手包办，否则，对你技术的提高上是没有什么好处的。希望你多费些脑筋再绘一个图，我代你修改。”姚在郑的具体帮助下，把摇梳片改制成功。郑金山常说：想搞好生产，只有老年的技术工人与青年工人密切的团结起来。这句话是一点不错的。
