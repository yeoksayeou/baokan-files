　　New Book and Journal Introduction
　　*World Knowledge*, Issue 12
　　The international affairs weekly *World Knowledge*, Volume 22, Issue 12, was published on September 23rd. To commemorate the 19th anniversary of the "September 18th Incident," this issue publishes an editorial entitled "Old Hatreds and New Grievances," pointing out that it has only been five years since Japanese fascists were driven out of China, and today American imperialists are fostering Japanese fascist forces again, and are personally following in the bloody footsteps of the defeated Japanese fascists to invade our country, attempting to slaughter the Chinese people and launch a third world war. The editorial calls on the people of the country to heighten their vigilance against old and new enemies, to smash the conspiracies of American imperialism, to liberate Taiwan, and to resolutely defend world peace.
