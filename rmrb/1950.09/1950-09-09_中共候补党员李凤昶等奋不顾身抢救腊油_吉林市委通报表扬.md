　　Reserve CCP Member Li Fengchang and Others
    Bravely Rescue Lard Oil
    Jilin Municipal Committee Commends Them in a Circular
    [Report from this newspaper] On August 10th, an oil leak occurred at the Yingjiangnan Chemical Factory in Jilin Province. Li Fengchang, Yang Zixin, Zhai Zhendong, Fu Baolin, Li Hanlin, and other reserve Communist Party members of the factory bravely jumped into the lard oil pool containing caustic soda to repair the discharge pipe, saving 130.9 tons of lard oil (worth approximately 2,273,960,000 Northeast currency) in the storage tank. The Jilin Municipal Committee issued a circular of commendation and sent people to the factory to express sympathy and give rewards. At around 9 p.m. on August 10th, workers working next to the lard oil storage tank discovered lard oil seeping through the base of the wall, flowing all over the ground, and quickly reported it to the factory负责人 [负责人 is hard to translate, but maybe "person in charge"]. When the factory director, the general branch secretary, the engineer, and the department director immediately inspected the site, they found that the discharge pipe of the storage tank containing 164.9 tons of lard oil was spewing oil like a dragon, and the ground in the 15-meter-long and wide room was covered in half a foot of lard oil. The oil pit in front of the discharge pipe was churning, and the oil was flowing out more and more rapidly. Because the lard oil contained caustic soda, there was a danger in going in to rescue it. So some suggested filling it with earth, and some wanted to find a water pump to pump it out, but none of these methods worked. Li Fengchang, the reserve Communist Party member and leader of the dry distillation team, silently took off his clothes, grabbed a pair of torn pants, and jumped down, immersing himself completely in the oil pit to block the discharge pipe. At that time, he felt heartbroken seeing the oil flowing out, thinking that even if he got burned, he could be treated; but if so much oil flowed out, the public would suffer a great loss. Because there was a lot of oil in the storage tank, the pressure was high and the oil flowed very fast. Li Fengchang couldn't block it alone. Then reserve Communist Party members Yang Zixin, Zhai Zhendong, Fu Baolin, Li Hanlin, and others successively jumped into the oil pit to block the discharge pipe. After a long time, their bodies were burned by the caustic soda to the point where they couldn't bear it anymore, so they took turns jumping out of the pit to wash off before going back down. The workers were moved by their selfless spirit. Everyone automatically brought water down to wash their faces, so as not to burn their eyes. After blocking for a long time, they finally blocked it, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. Suddenly, oil gushed out again. Li Fengchang quickly went down again and found that the 2.5-inch pipe had broken, so he quickly asked others to find a "plug" (a plug with a screw thread on the pipe head). The "plug" was found, and they jumped into the oil pit again to screw it in one turn at a time, until they plugged the pipe opening and saved 130.9 tons of lard oil in the storage tank. After Li Fengchang and others blocked the pipe, they ignored their fatigue and led the workers to use an oil pump to pump back the 30.6 tons of lard oil that had flowed onto the ground, further reducing the loss by nearly 531,570,000 Northeast currency. Thanks to their courageous rescue, the accident only resulted in the loss of 3.4 tons of lard oil, worth 56,260,000 Northeast currency. However, Comrade Li Fengchang couldn't hear much even eight days later because lard oil had entered his ears. The faces of the five people were swollen from the burns, and some people's skin was even broken, but they insisted on working as usual the next day. When someone asked them why they had such selfless courage, they answered very simply: "We are Communist Party members, and we should protect state property."

　　中共候补党员李凤昶等
    奋不顾身抢救腊油
    吉林市委通报表扬
    【本报讯】吉林省营江南化学工厂于八月十日发生漏油事故，该厂中共候补党员李凤昶、杨子新、翟振东、傅宝林、李翰林等奋不顾身，跳入含有火碱的腊油池中抢修排出管，保住了贮槽中一三○点九吨腊油（约值东北币二十二亿七千三百九十六万元）。吉林市委特通报表扬，并派人前往该厂，慰问奖励。八月十日午后九点多钟，在腊油贮槽隔壁做工的工友，发现腊油由墙根透过，流了满地，就急忙报告本厂负责人。当厂长、总支书记、工程师、部主任立即到该处视察时，发现装有一六四点九吨腊油的贮槽排出管像水龙一样往外冒油，长宽十五米屋地上已积存半尺深的腊油，排出管跟前的油坑直在翻花，愈流愈多。因为腊油中含有火碱，进去抢救是会有危险的，于是有的提议用土填，有的想找抽水泵来抽，但是这些办法都没有用处。干溜组长中共候补党员李凤昶，一声不响的脱光衣服，拿了一条破裤子，跳下去，全身浸在油坑中去堵排出管。当时他看着油淌出来心疼得很，就想着把自己烧坏点还能治；油淌出这么多，公家要受多大损失啊。贮槽中油多压力大，油流的很急，李凤昶一个人堵不住。接着中共候补党员杨子新、翟振东、傅宝林、李翰林等相继跳下油坑去堵排出管。时间长了，他们全身被火碱烧得实在支持不住，几个人轮流跳出坑来冲洗一下再下去。工友们被他们这种忘我的精神感动了，大家自动端水下去给他们洗脸，免得烧坏眼睛。堵了好久，好容易堵住了，大家松了一口气。忽然又冒出油来，李凤昶连忙又下去，发现原来是二寸五的管子开了，赶快叫别人去找“补心”（管子头上带螺丝口的堵头），“补心”找来了，他们几个又跳在油坑里一扣一扣的拧，直到把管子口堵好保住了贮槽里的一三○点九吨腊油。李凤昶等堵好管子后，又不顾疲劳带领工友用抽油泵去抽回流在地上的三○点六吨腊油，又减少了将近五亿三千一百五十七万元东北币的损失。经过他们的奋勇抢救，这事故只损失了三点四吨腊油，值五千六百二十六万元东北币。而李凤昶同志因为耳朵里进了腊油，八天后还听不见什么。五个人的脸都烧肿了，有的人身上还烧破了皮，但他们第二天就又照常坚持工作。有人问他们为什么有这样忘我的勇敢，他们回答得很简单：“我们是共产党员，应当爱护国家财产。”
