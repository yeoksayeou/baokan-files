　　A Record of Huang Jingtang, Production and Disaster Relief Model of Suxian County, Northern Anhui, Going to Beijing
　　Zhou Shimin

Huang Jingtang, the Communist Party branch secretary of Wangji Township, Suxian County, Northern Anhui, was elected as a model worker for production and disaster relief at the prefectural commendation conference and was nominated as a representative to the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. His joy was beyond words! A poor man who had begged for over twenty years never imagined he would go to Beijing for a meeting! Going to Beijing for a meeting would take about a month, and he wasn't comfortable leaving the township's work without clear instructions. Early in the morning of September 10th, he took time out from Suxian City to go back to the township. He entered the Dadian District government office, and it happened that all eighteen township cadres in the district were in a meeting. As soon as they heard that Huang Jingtang had been selected as a representative to the National Congress of Labor Models, all the cadres jumped up with joy and crowded around him, everyone vying to say, "Congratulations, Lao Huang! You'll get to see Chairman Mao this time!"

Amidst the applause, Huang Jingtang smiled and said to everyone, "This time I was selected as a representative of the national labor models, and this is not my accomplishment alone. I couldn't have done a good job of organizing disaster relief and production self-sufficiency for the whole township by myself. It's mainly thanks to the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all the township cadres, and also the efforts of more than 5,000 people in the township. Speaking of going to Beijing and being able to see Chairman Mao, I'm honored, and the cadres of Wangji Township and all the people of the township are equally honored, as are the people of the entire district and county!" He also said, "I will work even harder to lead the disaster-stricken people in production and self-sufficiency in the future, and I hope everyone will do the same. Everyone must be determined to do a good job and strive to be a model."

Taking advantage of the recess, Huang Jingtang made proposals to four township cadres, including the township head Ma Guanghua: now we should quickly distribute a portion of the disaster relief grain, we should continue to mobilize to hoe the sweet potatoes and buckwheat one more time, and we should start sideline production of spinning, weaving, oil pressing, and mat weaving. We should still dig ditches where we can, and we should mobilize to turn over the more than 3,000 mu of sunken land to plant a crop of wheat. He thought of everything. That night, he walked thirty li in the dark back to the Wangji Township government office to talk to some activists. More than eighty village cadres, militiamen, and ordinary people from the surrounding three or four li all rushed to see him that night. Ma Guangdong, the village chief of Ma Temple Village, clapped his hands with joy and said, "You're going to Beijing for a meeting, and you'll see the heroic models from all the provinces! You'll definitely learn a lot of good ways to promote production and disaster relief, and you can come back and teach us, and our township will have even better ways to promote production and disaster relief!" When the topic turned to the township's work, Lao Huang repeatedly instructed, "As long as we keep a close watch and patrol diligently, discuss things with everyone when things happen, and the village cadres must earnestly lead the digging of ditches and building of dams, we must not slack off in any of the disaster relief and production work." The village cadres happily said, "Don't worry about the meeting! We'll take care of everything in the village."

Wang Zuyi, a sixty-year-old white-haired poor peasant, heard that Lao Huang would be able to meet Chairman Mao this time, and he found a piece of paper that night and asked someone to write down three suggestions to bring to Chairman Mao: First, thank the Communist Party and the People's Government for distributing grain and saving the lives of thousands of disaster victims; Chairman Mao is the greatest benefactor, thinking of ideas for the disaster victims to produce and overcome the famine. Second, some cadres below are being a little too lenient in implementing the lenient policy, and many bandits and spies who have killed people have not been dealt with. Third, the large-grain buckwheat seeds we borrowed this year are not sprouting, and we don't know why.

In addition to expressing his responsibility to convey the message, Lao Huang also offered some explanations. Regarding the problem of buckwheat seeds not sprouting, he said, "This may be due to climate or soil conditions. This time when we go to Beijing, we will definitely discuss it with the representatives from the Northeast and Shandong." When he was about to leave the township government office, more than eighty men, women, and children asked him to convey their regards to Chairman Mao's health.

When the sun was high, Huang Jingtang returned to his home. His daughter, Guiying, holding her three-year-old younger brother, saw her father returning with a big red flower on his chest at a glance, and asked, jumping like a sparrow, "Dad, where did you get the flower?" Huang Jingtang was too embarrassed to say that he had become a labor model, so he only told his family that he was going to Beijing for a meeting. His seventy-year-old mother, who was cooking in the kitchen, heard that her son could go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao, and she was so excited that she opened her mouth and only managed to say after a long time, "This is truly the glory of our ancestors!" Huang Jingtang also told his family that he would not be back for a month, and instructed his wife to hoe the one mu of red sweet potatoes and two and a half mu of turnips again, and to hire someone to plow the one mu of vacant land so that wheat could be planted before he returned. His wife was cooking and replied quickly, "Even if you go for two or three months, our family's fields won't be barren. Don't worry about the family. The red sweet potatoes and turnips can yield several thousand catties, and with spinning and weaving, we won't have to worry about our livelihood." As she spoke, she cooked four eggs, saying they were "joy eggs," and insisted that he take them with him. After Huang Jingtang had breakfast, he was about to return to Sucheng. He patted his youngest son and said, "Mao Hai! Dad is going to see Chairman Mao!"

On the afternoon of the 11th, the public stadium in Sucheng was packed with people, with over a thousand people coming to see off the representatives going to Beijing. Huang Jingtang and Zhou Dekun, two labor models, wearing red flowers on their chests, got into a decorated car amidst the densely packed crowd, and the sounds of gongs and drums, firecrackers, and the noise of the people reverberated throughout Sucheng County. Carrying the glory and will of the people of Suxian who stubbornly fought against the famine, they set off for the capital.

　　记皖北宿县生产救灾模范黄景堂上北京
    周世民
    皖北宿县王集乡中共支部书记黄景堂，在全专区评功会上当选为生产救灾劳动模范，并被推选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表；他心里的欢喜，就不用说啦！一个讨过二十多年饭的穷人，那里想到过进北京开大会呢！上北京开会，来回要得个把月，乡里的工作，不交待清楚有点不放心。九月十日大清早，他从宿县城抽空回去一趟。进了大店区政府，正好全区十八个乡的干部都在开会，一听说黄景堂被选为全国劳模代表会议代表了，全体干部都欢喜的跳起来，一轰围住他，大家争着说：“恭喜老黄，你这次可见到毛主席了！”
    在掌声中，黄景堂笑着向大家说：“咱这次选成全国劳动模范的代表，这不是我一个人功劳，靠我一个人是搞不好全乡灾民生产自救工作的。主要还是党领导得正确和全乡干部的功劳，也是全乡五千多人民的功劳。说到上北京能看到毛主席吧，我光荣，王集乡干部和全乡人民同样光荣，也是全区和全县人民的光荣！”他又说：“我以后更要好好领导灾民生产自救，也希望大家这样做，个个要下决心做好工作，争取当模范。”
    黄景堂趁着休会时间，就向本乡乡长马光华等四个乡干部提出：现在应该赶快把一部救灾粮放下去，山芋、荞麦还要抓紧动员再锄一次，纺纱、织布、打油、编席这些副业生产，就要动手，能挖的沟还是要挖，三千多亩凹地要动员翻过来，种上收一季麦子。什么工作他都想到了。当天晚上，他又摸了三十里黑路，回到王集乡公所，找些积极分子谈话，周围三、四里的村干、民兵和老百姓们，八十多人，都连夜跑来看他，马庙村村长马广东喜得拍着手说：“你上北京开会，要看见各省的英雄模范啦！一定能学不少生产救灾好办法，回来传教传教，咱乡生产救灾更有办法啦！”提到乡里工作，老黄再三嘱咐：“只要抓紧打更放哨，遇事大家多商量，挖沟打坝，各村干部要认真领导，各项生救工作，千万不能松劲。”村干部高兴的说：“你放心开会吧！村里一切有我们负责。”
    六十多岁白发苍苍的贫农王祖益，听说老黄这次能会见毛主席，连夜找了张纸，请人写了三条意见托老黄带给毛主席：第一条、感谢共产党和人民政府，发放粮食救了千万灾民的性命；毛主席是第一大恩人，替灾民想主意生产，度过灾荒。第二条、下边有些干部执行宽大政策有点偏向，对杀过人的土匪、特务，有很多也未办。第三条、今年贷的大粒子荞麦种，不发棵，不知什么理道？
    老黄除表示负责转达外，并作了一些解释。对荞麦种不发棵问题，他说：“这可能是气候或土质关系，这次咱到北京，一定同东北、山东等地代表研究研究。”临离开乡公所时，八十多个男女老少，都请他代为问候毛主席健康。
    太阳竹杆高，黄景堂回到自己家里。女儿桂英抱着三岁的弟弟，一眼看见爸爸胸前带着大红花回来，喜得像雀子一样跳着问道：“大大，那来的花呀？”黄景堂没好意思说当了劳动模范，只告诉家里，说他要上北京开会。正在烧锅的七十岁的老妈妈，听说儿子能去北京见到毛主席，兴奋得张着嘴，半天才说出一句：“这真是咱家祖上的光荣啊！”黄景堂并告诉家里，他要一个月才能回来，吩咐妻子赶快把一亩红芋，二亩半葫萝卜再锄一遍，一亩闲田要请牛工翻过来，不等他回来就可种麦。妻在做饭，连忙回答说：“你去两个月、三个月咱家田也荒不了，你莫愁家里，红芋萝卜能收大几千斤，再纺纱织布，生活还愁吗？”边说边煮好了四个鸡蛋，说是“喜蛋”，硬要他带着。黄景堂吃过早饭，要回宿城了。他拍拍小儿子说：“毛孩呀！大大去见毛主席啦！”
    十一日下午，宿城公共体育场上挤满了人，一千多人来欢送晋京代表。黄景堂和周德坤两位劳动模范，胸前挂着红花，在挤不动的人群当中坐上了挂彩的汽车，前后的锣鼓声、鞭炮声、人们的噪杂声，震动了宿县城。他们带着和灾荒顽强斗争的宿县人民的光荣和意志，向首都出发了。
