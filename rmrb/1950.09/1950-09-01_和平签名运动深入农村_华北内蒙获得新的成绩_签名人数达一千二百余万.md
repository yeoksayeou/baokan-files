Xinhua News Agency, August 28th: The peace signature campaign in various provinces of North China, Beijing, Tianjin, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region continues to achieve new successes. According to incomplete statistics as of recently, the number of people in the aforementioned areas who have signed the Peace Declaration has reached 12,259,300.

After mass activities such as the Peace Movement Propaganda Week and the Anti-American Imperialism Aggression Against Taiwan and Korea Movement Propaganda Week in North China, the broad masses of people have significantly improved their understanding of international current affairs and the significance of the peace signature campaign, and have enthusiastically signed. In the sparsely populated Ar Horqin Banner of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, male and female herders in the Baiyindila Nuutuk area rode horses, carrying their children, to remote places to sign. As of August 15th, the number of signatures in Inner Mongolia had reached 432,000. Mass organizations such as the regional Federation of Trade Unions, the Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have issued notices calling for the joint efforts of all propaganda forces to strive for 800,000 signatures. The number of signatures in Hebei Province is approaching 5 million. Lin Tie, secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, called on the people of the province to strive for 16 million signatures on the Peace Declaration by the end of September. People's organizations in Tangshan City, Hebei Province, organized 180 signature propaganda stations to promote the peace signature campaign; in addition, 22,000 workers and students formed 100 propaganda teams, using various propaganda tools, and collected 220,000 signatures in a short period of time, accounting for 66 percent of the city's population. In addition, the Propaganda Department of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party printed more than 25,000 propaganda manuals, and the provincial and large sub-committees printed more than 300,000 propaganda posters, leaflets, and maps. Various localities have also systematically organized county and district cadres to study and discuss documents on defending world peace and opposing wars of aggression. The number of signatures in Shanxi Province has reached 1,992,000, of which more than 1,640,000 are farmers. Students in various cities in the province, in coordination with rural cadres and rural intellectuals, combined current affairs propaganda with production and went deep into farmers' homes to carry out propaganda, which has made the signature campaign a truly conscious action of farmers. In Chahar Province, organized masses such as workers, students, cadres, and cultural troupes used methods such as chats, speeches, posting cartoons, and performing dramas to promote the peace signature campaign. The total number of signatures in the province has reached 1.39 million, of which nearly one million are farmers. The province is now striving for 2 million signatures. As of the 8th of this month, there were more than 452,000 signatures in Suiyuan Province. The number of peace signatures in Pingyuan Province has exceeded 500,000.
