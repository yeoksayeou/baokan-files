Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, August 31st: With the strong support of the National Bank, private banks in Guangzhou have begun to get on the right track.

The two joint state-private banks in Guangzhou, Xinhua and China Industrial, as well as the five private banks Shanghai Industrial, Jin Cheng, He Cheng, Ju Xing Cheng, and Guo Hua, have all seen business development recently. Deposits and loans are increasing month by month. The total deposit balance of the above seven banks in January was 1.3 billion yuan, which increased to 39.6 billion yuan by July. The loan balance in January was 300 million yuan, which increased to 18.4 billion yuan in July. Among them, industrial loans increased from 7 percent of the total loans in April to 12 percent in July. In terms of remittances: from January to July, a total of 257.4 billion yuan was remitted out and 361.6 billion yuan was remitted in.

The development of private banks' proper business has played a certain role in promoting trade between urban and rural areas, assisting production, and facilitating overseas remittances. At the same time, the banks themselves have also turned from losses to profits. In February, only two of the above seven banks made a profit; at the end of the first half of the year, only two were still losing money; in July, all of them had a surplus. The reason for this is, on the one hand, that the overall industrial and commercial situation has improved initially recently; on the other hand, it is the result of the National Bank's assistance measures such as increasing interest rates on transferred deposits, charging 80% of the original exchange rate to help allocate funds, and holding re-mortgage rediscounts. In particular, these banks have been approved as designated foreign exchange banks, and under the principle of "foreign exchange belongs to the public, profits belong to the private," they have gained considerable profits in export settlement business.

　　穗私营银行在国家银行扶助下
    业务开始步入正轨
    【新华社广州八月三十一日电】广州市各私营银行在国家银行大力扶助下，业务已开始步入正轨。
    广州市新华、中国实业两家公私合营银行及上海实业、金城、和成、聚兴诚、国华五家私营银行，近来业务均有开展。存款、放款逐月递增。上述七家银行一月份存款余额共为十三亿元，至七月份增至三百九十六亿元；一月份放款余额为三亿元，七月份增至一百八十四亿元，其中工业放款由四月份占放款总额百分之七增至七月份的百分之十二；汇兑方面：一至七月份合计汇出二千五百七十四亿元，汇入三千六百一十六亿元。
    私营银行正当业务的开展，对促进城乡内外贸易，扶助生产，疏通侨汇均起了一定的作用。同时银行本身也因此由亏损走向盈余。二月份上述七家银行获利的仅有两家；上半年结算，已仅有两家亏损；七月份则全部都有了盈余。其原因，一方面是由于整个工商业情况近来已初步好转；另一方面是国家银行采用加息转存款办法、按原汇率八折收费帮助调拨头寸、以及举办转抵押重贴现等扶助的结果。特别是这些银行均被核准为外汇指定银行，在“外汇归公、利润归私”的原则下，他们在出口结汇业务中获得不少利润。
