　　Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: Polish Press Agency dispatch: Warsaw's People's Tribune commented on the Security Council meeting on September 18th, stating: Openly discussing the sensitive issue of the invasion of Taiwan (Formosa) is very embarrassing for the United States, because the undeniable fact is that the United States has no reason whatsoever to send its naval and air forces to Chinese territory. The United States wants to get rid of their predicament by a very simple method, that is, by violating the procedural principles of the Security Council. By starting up their infamous voting machine, they make it impossible to discuss this issue. However, it is not the U.S. voting machine that decides Taiwan's fate; the Chinese people will decide their own fate.

　　波报斥美违反安理会程序
    美表决机器不能决定台湾命运  决定台湾命运的将是中国人民
    【新华社二十一日讯】波兰通讯社讯：华沙人民论坛报二十日评安理会九月十八日会议称：公开讨论侵略台湾（福摩萨）这样一个微妙的问题，对于美国是很难堪的，因为无可置辩的事实是美国没有丝毫的理由就把它的海空军开到中国领土上。美国想用一种非常简单的办法，即违反安理会的程序原则，来摆脱他们的尴尬局面。把他们臭名远扬的表决机器开动起来，而使得这个问题不可能讨论。但是，决定台湾的命运的不是美国的表决机器，中国人民将会决定他们自己的命运。
