　　Northeast Coal Mine Model Worker Zhang Zifu and Others Represent 160,000 Miners
    Submitting a Letter to Chairman Mao, Reporting Their Determination to Work Hard and Produce
    [This Newspaper's Report] Eight coal miner model worker representatives, including Zhang Zifu, attending the National Congress of Labor Models, on September 20th, on behalf of 160,000 coal miners in the Northeast region, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to pay their respects, determined to use practical actions of increasing production, ensuring quality, and reducing costs to oppose the aggression of American imperialism, support the early liberation of Taiwan and Tibet by our great army, and strive to the end for the construction of the New China. The original letter stated: Respected Chairman Mao:
    We are representatives of 160,000 coal miners in the Northeast region, and will be attending the National Congress of Labor Models. We respectfully salute you. This meeting is convened under the wise leadership of our leader Chairman Mao, closely uniting the people of the whole country. The victory achieved after nearly thirty years of heroic struggle is a victory for the Chinese working class and a victory for the Chinese people. Such a great meeting is unprecedented in Chinese history, and it is also impossible in any feudal or capitalist country. We deeply feel that such a meeting can only be held under the regime led by the working class. Therefore, we are deeply grateful to our own working class party and our leader for the encouragement and leadership given to us. In order to welcome this great meeting and the arrival of the first National Day, we, on behalf of the 160,000 coal miners in the Northeast region, must take practical actions, work hard to produce, ensure the completion of the glorious tasks given to us by our superiors, strengthen organization and discipline, implement the responsibility system, eliminate accidents due to negligence, so that our miners can carry out production under safe conditions, and also improve efficiency, ensure quality, reduce consumption, reduce costs, accumulate national funds, and accelerate our industrial construction and economic construction. We will use our greatest strength to support lasting world peace, vow to oppose the American imperialist war of aggression to the death, support our great army to liberate Taiwan and Tibet as soon as possible, and strive to the end for the construction of the New China! We wish you good health!
  Northeast Coal Miners Representatives: Zhang Zifu, Shi Yuhai, Zhao Huanan, Liu Xianting, Li Qingxuan,
            Zhang Xiuying, Li Leting, Qu Fuming. September 20th
