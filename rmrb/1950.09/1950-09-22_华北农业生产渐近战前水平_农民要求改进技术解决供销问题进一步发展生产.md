    Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: North China's agricultural production, which is rapidly advancing after land reform and the organization of mutual aid in labor, is gradually approaching the pre-War of Resistance Against Japan production levels. Farmers in North China are now demanding improved technology and solutions to supply and marketing problems in order to further develop production.
    In the old liberated areas of North China, after Chairman Mao proposed organizing production campaigns in the spring of 1943, mutual aid work teams developed universally. Because of this organization, North China's old areas were able to avoid excessive decline in agricultural production levels during the most difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, and were able to support the front lines on a large scale during the War of Liberation. With the end of the war and the completion of land reform, the productive forces (labor, draught animals, farm implements) and production levels in North China's rural areas recovered rapidly. As of the first half of this year, the agricultural production level in North China's old areas has reached approximately 83% of the pre-war level, with a few areas having already reached the pre-war level, and individual counties even exceeding it; the newly liberated areas during the War of Liberation have also reached approximately 60% to 70% of the pre-war level. The promoting role played by mutual aid work teams in this process has been significant. However, due to the changes in the aforementioned production conditions, farmers in North China's old areas are no longer satisfied with simple mutual aid work; they are further demanding improved technology, requiring the People's Government to strengthen leadership in technology, and to solve rural supply and marketing difficulties in order to develop sideline production.
    Regarding the improvement of technology, North China's farmers universally demand the prevention and treatment of plant diseases and insect pests, the improvement of varieties, farm implements, soil, and cultivation methods, the increased application of fertilizer, and the improvement of fertilization techniques, etc., with the most urgent demand being the prevention and treatment of plant diseases and insect pests. Farmers say, "If the production policy is correct, it is useless if pests cannot be controlled." Last year, North China's grain production was reduced by approximately 5 billion jin due to disasters such as floods, droughts, and insect pests, and this year's wheat production was also reduced by more than 900 million jin. Facts have proven that improving technology is the key to further developing production.
    People's Governments at all levels in North China have paid great attention to improving technology this year. For example, this year's river management and dike construction projects have greatly reduced flood disasters; various localities have organized people to catch and kill pests, called on people to select and soak seeds, and distributed some insecticides and machinery, thereby basically preventing the spread of plant diseases and insect pests; organizing people to dig wells and repair canals, lending waterwheels, and organizing water carrying for sowing in spring in areas lacking rain have also remedied the drought in some areas. In particular, the Anyang Special District of Pingyuan Province has created preliminary experience in agricultural technology leadership. The Anyang Special District, with the Special Commissioner's Office Agricultural Section as its main body, absorbed relevant departments such as farms and technology promotion stations, and teachers with scientific knowledge to establish a technology research association, and implemented systematic guidance to technology research associations at the county, district, and village levels. More than 600 villages in the special district have organized villages with technical committees centered on experienced farmers, which ensures the implementation of technical guidance. In the farmers' mutual aid groups, emphasis is also placed on promoting individual skills, teaching each other, learning from each other, dividing labor according to strengths, and scientifically using labor. In this way, some technical core figures have gradually emerged in the mutual aid groups. This not only improves farmers' technology, but also further consolidates the mutual aid organizations. At the same time, the government actively rewards and supports those with special technical skills (such as veterinarians, handicraftsmen who create farm implements), eliminating their old ideas of "not passing on secrets."
    On the issue of combining scientific technology with farmers' experience, the important experience of Anyang Special District is: first, cadres must learn technology and bring technology to the countryside. This year, the special district used methods such as running training classes, printing and distributing technical manuals, and organizing various (high-quality varieties, drawings of pest control, new farm implements, etc.) roving exhibitions to enable all rural work cadres, from leading cadres in the special district and county to village cadres, to learn technology. They brought technology to the countryside, combined it with the promotion of production policies, and at the same time promoted the improvement of technology and conducted on-site experiments, which were very popular with farmers. This also relieved the distress of rural work cadres in production leadership. Cadres in the villages, together with the village technology research associations, used methods such as "comparing seedlings," "comparing harvests," and "running small farms" (i.e., farmers leave small plots of land in the fields to try out various varieties) to research, organize, and promote farmers' production experience while promoting scientific technology, which has been very effective. This not only makes scientific technology easier for farmers to accept, but also finds the source of technology from the masses and from practice, solving the cadres' idea of only asking superiors for technology.
    The supply and marketing difficulties in North China's rural areas are the difficulty in selling agricultural and rural sideline products (mainly sideline products) and the problem of some areas not being able to buy enough industrial products. In order to solve this problem, the People's Government has taken the following three measures: First, it has ordered state-owned trade organs at all levels to ensure the completion of the procurement tasks for agricultural and sideline products such as grain, cotton, medicinal materials, furs, and eggs; second, it has assisted in the development of rural supply and marketing cooperatives; and third, it has organized and encouraged private merchants to go to the countryside to engage in local product business. Among these, the supply and marketing cooperative in Linqi Town, Linxian County, Pingyuan Province, uses a supply and marketing chain contract method that is most popular with farmers. After the cooperative signed a contract with the provincial cooperative warehouse to exchange food for salt, it signed a contract with the Changzhi Yincheng Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi to exchange salt and native cloth for ironware (farm implements) (Yincheng is a distribution center for ironware in southeastern Shanxi), and then supplied the ironware to farmers, and signed a contract with surrounding village cooperatives to exchange ironware for grain and native cloth. In this way, local farmers obtained inexpensive ironware and salt, and grain and native cloth also had a sales outlet.
    Another demand of the farmers is to solve the problem of labor output during the slack season in order to increase income. Therefore, they demand the development of sideline occupations and care for sideline occupations. In the old areas of North China, most of the mutual aid groups that have persisted for three, four, six, or seven years are those that combine agriculture and sideline occupations. People's Governments at all levels in North China have paid attention to leading farmers to engage in sideline production and support the sideline occupations that are needed by the people and the country and have a way out; and they have paid attention to combining agriculture and sideline occupations.
    In North China, in areas where agricultural production recovery is relatively poor, organization still plays a major role in overcoming the difficulties of lack of labor, livestock, and agricultural tools. In areas where the level of production has reached or exceeded pre-war levels, attention has been paid to improving technology and strengthening the state's economic leadership over agricultural production on the basis of organization, in order to further improve agricultural production.

### 华北农业生产渐近战前水平  农民要求改进技术解决供销问题进一步发展生产

　　华北农业生产渐近战前水平
    农民要求改进技术解决供销问题进一步发展生产
    【新华社二十一日讯】经过土地改革和组织劳动互助，迅速前进的华北农业生产，已逐渐接近抗日战争以前的生产水平。华北各地农民现正要求改进技术，解决供销问题，以便进一步发展生产。
    华北老解放区，在一九四三年春毛主席提出组织起来开展生产运动后，变工互助组织就普遍发展起来。因为组织起来，华北老区在抗日战争最困难的时期，农业生产水平才未过分下降，并能在解放战争中大规模地支援前线。随着战争结束和土地改革的完成，华北农村生产力（劳动力、畜力、农具）和生产水平都很快恢复了。截至今年上半年，华北老区的农业生产水平已相当于战前水平的百分之八十三，少数地区已达到战前的水平，个别县份甚至已经超过；解放战争中解放的新区，也已相当于战前水平的百分之六十到百分之七十。变工互助组织在这中间所起的推动作用是很大的。但是，由于上述生产条件的变化，华北老区的农民，对于单纯的变工互助已不能满足，他们进一步要求改进技术，要求人民政府在技术上加强领导，和解决农村供销困难以便发展副业生产等问题。
    在改进技术方面，华北农民普遍的要求是防治病虫害、改良品种、农具、土壤和耕作方法，增施肥料和改进施肥技术等等，而最迫切的要求则是防治病虫害。农民说：“生产政策对了，治不了虫也是枉然。”去年华北因水、旱、虫等灾原粮减产约五十亿斤，今年小麦又减产九亿多斤，事实证明：改进技术是进一步发展生产的关键。
    华北各地人民政府在改进技术方面今年已给予很大注意。例如今年进行治河修堤等工程，曾大大地缩小了水灾；各地曾组织人民捕打害虫，号召人民选种浸种，并发放了一部分杀虫药剂和器械，因而基本上制止了病虫灾害的蔓延；组织人民打井修渠，贷放水车和在春季缺雨地区组织担水下种等也补救了部分地区缺雨的旱象。特别是平原省安阳专区在农作技术领导上更创造了初步的经验。安阳专区以专署农业科为主，吸收农场、技术推广站等有关部门和有科学知识的教员成立技术研究会，对县、区、村各级技术研究会实行系统的指导。该专区以老农为中心组织有技术委员会的村庄已有六百多村，这样就保证了技术指导的贯彻。在农民的互助组中也强调发扬一技之长，互教互学，按所长分工合作，科学地使用劳动力。这样，互助组中也逐渐出现了一些技术上的核心人物。这不仅提高了农民技术，并进一步巩固了互助组织。同时，政府对有技术特长者（如兽医、对农具有创造的手工业者）积极予以奖励和扶植，消除了他们的“秘诀不传”的旧思想。
    在科学技术与农民经验结合的问题上，安阳专区的重要经验是：首先要使干部学会技术，带技术下乡。该专区今年以办训练班、印发技术手册、组织各种（优良品种、防治病虫害的图画、新农具等）巡回展览等方法，使所有农村工作干部，从专区和县的领导干部到村干部都学会了技术。他们带了技术下乡，结合宣传生产政策，同时宣传提高技术，当场试验，大受农民欢迎。这样，也就解脱了乡村工作干部在生产领导上的苦闷。干部在村中和村技术研究会一起，用“比禾苗”、“比收成”、“办小农场”（即农民在地头留出小块土地试种各种品种）的方法，一面研究、整理和推广农民的生产经验，一面推广科学技术，收效很大。这样不仅科学技术容易为农民所接受，也从群众中从实际中找到了技术的来源，解决了干部光向上级要技术的思想。
    华北农村的供销困难，是农业和农村副业产品（主要是副业产品）的销路困难和部分地区买不到足够的工业品的问题。为了解决这个问题，人民政府已采取了下列三个办法：一、责成各级国营贸易机关保证完成对粮食、棉花、药材、皮毛、鸡蛋等农副产品的收购任务；二、协助发展农村供销合作社；三、组织和鼓励私商下乡经营土产。这中间平原省林县临淇镇供销合作社订供销连锁合同的方式最为农民所欢迎。该社以粮食与省合作货栈等订了换食盐合同后，即以食盐和土布与山西长治荫城镇供销社订了换铁货（农具）的合同（荫城为晋东南铁货集散地），然后又以铁货供应农民，与周围各村合作社订了铁货换粮食和土布的合同。这样，当地农民既获得了廉价的铁货和食盐，粮食和土布也有了销路。
    农民的另一个要求是解决农闲时劳动力的出路问题，以便增加收入。因此，他们就要求发展副业，和照顾副业。华北老区凡坚持了三、四或六、七年的互助组，大都是农副业结合的。华北各地人民政府已注意领导农民进行副业生产，扶植为人民和国家所需要的有出路的副业；并已注意使农业与副业相结合。
    在华北，在农业生产恢复较差的地区，组织起来在克服缺乏劳动力、畜力和农具的困难方面，仍起着重大的作用。在生产水平已达到或已超过战前的地区，则已注意在组织起来的基础上，着重改进技术和加强国家对农业生产的经济领导，以求进一步提高农业生产。
