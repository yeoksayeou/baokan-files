Australian Youth Fight Against Menzies' Reactionary Government
An Interview with Australian Youth Representative Ebeles

Ebeles, the Australian representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, told reporters about the struggle of Australian youth against domestic reactionaries and in defense of world peace. He said: "Since Menzies came to power last December, as a result of his anti-policy, the cost of living has risen by 11 percent, and 400,000 people lack housing. Rising prices and severe housing shortages directly affect the lives of the Australian people and youth. Many young people get married but have no houses to live in, and their lives are becoming increasingly difficult.

"In January of this year, in order to protect the 25 million pounds of investment of big capitalists in Malaya, the reactionary Menzies government actually ordered conscription, intending to send domestic youth to Malaya to assist Britain in suppressing the national liberation movement of the Malayan people. However, Australian young workers and students actively opposed this reactionary measure. Under the call of the Australian Eureka Youth League, youth across the country held rallies on February 21st, the World Day of Struggle for Colonial Youth. At the meeting, everyone was determined to oppose the conscription order, and after the meeting, a delegation was organized to appeal to the Menzies government to revoke the conscription order.

This August, young workers held a rally under the call of the Sydney trade union, unanimously opposing the conscription law. Due to the active opposition of the people and youth across the country, it is very difficult or even impossible for the reactionary Menzies government to implement his conscription law.

Australian youth enthusiastically participated in the movement to defend world peace. In April of this year, the Australian people held a peace conference, and the participants unanimously condemned the Menzies government for assisting the British Empire in the colonial war in Malaya and illegally promulgating the conscription order. The conference responded to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and quickly launched a peace signature campaign across the country. Young people took the lead in this movement, and about one-third or more of the signatures nationwide were collected by young people.

"The Menzies government has always adopted repressive measures against progressive forces. Sharkey, the General Secretary of the Australian Communist Party, and the manager of the Australian Communist Party's newspaper 'Tribune' have both been unreasonably sentenced to imprisonment. The Menzies government has further proposed a bill to outlaw the Australian Communist Party, plotting to declare the Australian Communist Party illegal. This reactionary measure has been opposed by the Australian people."

Ebeles said: "Australian youth are paying great attention to the victory of the Chinese revolution. Australian youth, who are under the clutches of American and British imperialism, fully understand the significance of the struggle of the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries for independence, freedom, and liberation."

Finally, Ebeles talked about his impression of New China and said: "The happy life and enthusiastic learning and work of Chinese youth are absolutely unseen in capitalist countries. Talking to any Chinese student, you can find that they are very happy and have a fire-like enthusiasm. As for the youth in Australia, they hope to work as little as possible, because no one wants to make money for the bloodsucking reactionary capitalists. After coming to China, I distinctly felt that I had entered a new world." He said that in Northeast China, he saw how Chinese young workers were working selflessly for the construction of New China. They are rebuilding large-scale factories on the ruins plundered and destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits. He firmly believes that the Chinese people have the confidence and strength to liberate all of their territory.

　　澳大利亚青年为反对孟席斯反动政府而斗争
    澳大利亚青年代表艾贝尔斯访问记
    世界民主青年联盟代表团澳大利亚代表艾贝尔斯，告诉了记者关于澳大利亚青年反对国内反动派、保卫世界和平的斗争情况。他说：“自去年十二月孟席斯上台之后，由于他实行反对政策的结果，生活指数上涨了百分之十一，有四十万人缺少住房。物价上涨与房荒严重，直接影响了澳大利亚人民与青年的生活，很多青年结了婚而没有房子住，生活日益困窘。
    “今年一月孟席斯反动政府为了保护大资本家在马来亚的二千五百万镑的投资，竟下令征兵，想把国内青年送到马来亚协助英国镇压马来亚人民的民族解放运动。但是澳大利亚青年工人、学生们积极反对这一反动措施。全国各地青年在澳大利亚尤里加青年联盟的号召下，在二月二十一日世界殖民地青年斗争日举行集会，会上万众一心坚决反对征兵令，会后并组织代表团向孟席斯政府呼吁撤销征兵令。
    今年八月，青年工人在悉尼工会的号召下举行了集会，一致反对征兵法令。由于全国人民和青年积极反对，使得孟席斯反动政府很难甚至根本不可能去实行他的征兵法令。
    澳大利亚青年热烈地参加了保卫世界和平运动，今年四月间澳大利亚人民举行了和平大会，与会者一致谴责孟席斯政府帮助英帝进行马来亚殖民战争的罪行及非法颁布征兵令。大会响应了和大常委会的号召，在全国迅速展开和平签名运动。青年们在这一运动里起了带头作用，全国约三分之一以上的签名是青年征集来的。
    “孟席斯政府对进步力量一贯采取镇压手段，澳共总书记夏基，澳共机关报《论坛报》的经理均先后被无理判处徒刑。孟席斯政府并进一步地提出取缔澳共议案，阴谋宣布澳共为非法，这种反动措施受到全澳人民的反对。”
    艾贝尔斯说：“澳大利亚青年以极大的热情来关注中国的革命的胜利。处在美英帝国主义魔手下的澳大利亚青年他们充分体会到殖民地及半殖民地国家人民为争取独立自由解放而斗争的意义。”
    最后艾贝尔斯谈到对新中国的印象说：“中国青年的幸福生活及热情的学习与工作，在资本主义国家里是绝对看不到的，随便和那一个中国学生谈话，都可以发现他们非常愉快，有火一般的热情。至于澳大利亚的青年们却希望工作得越少越好，因为没有人愿意替吸血的反动资本家赚钱的。来到了中国后，截然分明地感觉进入了一个新世界。”他说，在东北他看到中国青年工人怎样在为着新中国的建设忘我地工作着。他们就在日寇和国民党匪帮所劫掠与破坏的废墟上，重新建设起规模宏大的工厂来。他坚决相信：中国人民有信心、有力量解放全部国土。
