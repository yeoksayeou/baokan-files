　　Conducting Self-Criticism and Learning the Mass Line
    Wuxi Rural Work Group Receives Enthusiastic Welcome from the Masses
    [Our Paper News] The Wuxi Rural Work Group of Jiangsu Province, after rectification and study, has basically overcome the commandist style and initially improved its relationship with the masses. Since the work group went to the countryside in September last year, it has mobilized and organized the broad masses of peasants through movements such as organizing peasant associations, autumn grain collection, rent reduction, and production for disaster relief, achieving great results. However, due to the commandist style in its work, some estrangement existed between cadres and the masses, and between work team cadres and local cadres. In June of this year, the entire group concentrated on rectification, focusing on examining commandism, criticizing the erroneous idea that "tasks cannot be completed without coercion and command," clarifying the unity of policy and tasks, improving the policy and ideological level of all cadres, and strengthening the mass viewpoint.
    After the rectification, the work teams went to various townships and first conveyed the spirit of the rectification at township cadre meetings, conducting self-criticism. After dispersing to the villages, they continued to implement the spirit of rectification at various village cadre meetings and meetings of all sizes, and made face-to-face self-criticism and apologies to cadres or masses who had been offended by coercion and command in the past. The work team's spirit of self-criticism greatly moved the masses. Villagers in Liujia Dang, Sitou Township, said, "The comrades of the work group came to the countryside to help us stand up, and if they do something wrong, they still apologize to us. Only the Communist Party and the People's Government can do this." The masses began to break down their concerns and boldly put forward their opinions to the work group comrades. For example, at a cadre meeting in Taian Township, more than a dozen people raised twenty opinions. Some local cadres and masses also followed suit and launched criticism and self-criticism. In this way, some of the estrangement between the work team and local cadres and the masses gradually disappeared. Local cadres and masses who had previously been passive are now active and close to the work team.
    After the rectification, the work style of the work team comrades underwent great changes. The first manifestation was the mastery of the working method of following the mass line. The seventh group of the fourth team was originally a group with a very serious commandist style, but after the rectification, it made great progress. Xinbei Township, where the group works, is close to Taihu Lake. In mid-July, it was discovered that some people were cutting the green reeds along the lake. Cutting the green reeds caused the lake water to hit the shore, which would damage the rice on the shore. At that time, the farmers on the shore and the owners of the green reeds asked the work team to come forward to prohibit and severely punish the thieves. However, other farmers, because they had not suffered any losses themselves, held a "who cares" attitude. Some people even thought that stealing green reeds was also for the sake of eating and was not a big mistake. The work team studied this situation and first publicized the harm of cutting green reeds at cadre meetings and mass meetings, pointing out that cutting green reeds would not only affect the rice of a few households on the shore, but also cause the lake water to gradually push inward in the future, which would affect everyone and affect production. After such education, cadres and the masses realized that stealing green reeds was wrong. Then, the peasant association convened a farmers' meeting to mobilize everyone to protect the green reeds. After the masses were mobilized, no one cut green reeds anymore. Under the influence of the work team's work style, the work style of local cadres also changed. For example, Zhao Wenhua, the director of the peasant association of the fifteenth village in the township, used to act arbitrarily, but now he knows to consult with the masses when something happens.
    Secondly, in leading production, the work team personally participated in labor and patiently and specifically led the masses. In early July, there were continuous heavy rains, and more than a thousand acres of farmland in Liucang Township were flooded. The comrades of the work team braved the rain to mobilize the farmers to bail water. Two of them fell and were covered in mud, but they persisted tirelessly, saving all the rice seedlings. In mid-to-late July, Jingfu, Xiangping and other townships experienced drought. The work team patiently persuaded the water bailers, cart drivers, and farmers to solve the difficulty of bailing water through democratic consultation, ensuring the irrigation of the rice seedlings. Through leading production work, the work team further strengthened its ties with the masses. In mid-August, the work team held a centralized study. When they returned to the countryside in September, they were warmly welcomed by the masses everywhere. Many villagers rushed to the work team's residence to ask about their well-being.
    After the rectification, although the commandist style has been basically overcome, many cadres in some places still have a paternalistic style. Secondly, after overcoming commandism, some comrades have become too cautious in their work, which needs to be overcome in the future.
    The work group has the following points of experience in this rectification and overcoming the commandist style:
    1. Overcoming commandism is a long-term and arduous task. Sometimes, after one form is overcome, another form appears. Therefore, examining and summarizing work, conducting criticism and self-criticism, strengthening the mass concept and policy viewpoint, and overcoming the purely task-oriented viewpoint should be regarded as a regular and important part of future cadre education.
    2. The commandism of subordinates in carrying out tasks is inseparable from the bureaucracy of the leadership. Therefore, while overcoming commandism, attention should be paid to overcoming bureaucracy. The leadership should regularly go deep into the lower levels to check work and help lower levels solve difficulties; when summarizing and arranging work, they should listen to the opinions of lower levels. Otherwise, if the higher authorities assign too many and too urgent tasks, commandism will easily breed in order to complete the tasks.
    3. It is necessary to carry out criticism and self-criticism between cadres and the masses, and mobilize the masses to supervise cadres to ensure the correct implementation of policies. Facts have proved that in places where criticism and self-criticism have been launched after rectification, errors in work are quickly corrected. For example, in Zuoqi Village, Liucang Township, the cadres' lending of bean cakes was not democratic. After the masses raised criticisms, the deviation was quickly corrected.

### 开展自我批评学走群众路线  无锡农村工作团受到群众热烈欢迎

　　开展自我批评学走群众路线
    无锡农村工作团受到群众热烈欢迎
    【本报讯】江苏无锡农村工作团，经过整风学习后，基本上克服了命令主义作风，初步改善了与群众的关系。该工作团自去年九月下乡以来，通过组织农会、秋征、减租、生产救灾等运动，发动组织了广大农民群众，获得很大成绩；但由于工作中存在命令主义作风，使干部与群众、工作组干部与地方干部之间存在一些隔阂。今年六月，全团集中整风，着重检查了命令主义，批判了“不强迫命令不能完成任务”的错误思想，明确了政策与任务的统一性，提高了全团干部的政策思想水平，加强了群众观点。
    整风结束后，工作队到达各乡，先在乡干部会上传达整风精神，进行自我检讨。分散到村后，又在各村干部会和各种大小会上继续贯彻整风精神，并向以往因强迫命令而得罪了的干部或群众当面检讨认错。工作队这种自我批评的精神，大大感动了群众。寺头乡刘家宕的村民说：“工作组同志下乡来帮助我们翻身，做错了事，还要向我们认错，只有共产党、人民政府才能做得到。”群众开始打破顾虑，大胆向工作组同志提出意见。如泰安乡干部会上就有十几个人，提了二十条意见。有些地方干部和群众，也跟着展开了批评与自我批评。这样一来，工作队与地方干部及群众中间的一些隔膜也逐渐消除了。过去表现消极的地方干部和群众，现在都积极起来，并和工作队靠拢了。
    整风后，工作队同志的工作作风有了很大的转变。首先表现在开始掌握了走群众路线的工作方法。四队七组原来是强迫命令作风很严重的一个组，经过整风后，有了很大进步。该组进行工作的新北乡靠近太湖，七月中发现有人割湖边的青芦。割了青芦，湖水往岸上打，岸边稻子就要受损失。当时岸边农民与青芦主人要求工作队出面禁止，予偷割者以严厉的处分。但其他农民因为自己未受到损失，抱着“无所谓”的态度；有的人还认为偷青芦也是为了吃饭，没有大错。工作队研究了这个情况，首先在干部会、群众会上将割了青芦的坏处进行宣传，指出割了青芦不但是岸边几户人家的稻子受影响，将来湖水逐渐往里推，大家都要受损失，影响生产。经过这样教育后，干部、群众都认识了偷青芦的不对。接着，农会便召集农民大会，动员大家保护青芦。群众发动后，便不再有人割青芦了。在工作队这样工作作风的影响下，地方干部的作风也有了转变。如该乡十五村农会主任赵文惠过去做事独断独行，现在有事也知道找群众商量了。
    其次，在领导生产方面，工作队亲自参加劳动，耐心具体地领导群众。七月初连日大雨，刘仓乡千多亩田被淹，工作队同志冒雨动员农民戽水，其中两个人跌得满身泥浆，仍坚持不懈，使秧田全部得救；到中、下旬，荆福、香平等乡有旱象，工作队就耐心说服戽水商、包车头及农民三方，用民主协商办法解决戽水困难，保证了稻苗的灌溉。通过领导生产工作，工作队更加密切了与群众的联系。八月中，工作队曾集中学习，九月回到乡下时，到处受到群众热烈欢迎，许多村民争着到工作队住所来问长问短。
    整风后，强迫命令虽然基本上克服了，但不少地方的干部中仍有包办代替作风；其次，有些同志在克服了命令主义后，在工作中又产生了束手束脚的偏向，有待今后克服。
    工作团在这次整风与克服命令主义作风当中，有如下几点体会：
    一、克服命令主义是一个长期艰苦的工作，有时这一种形式克服了，又出现另一种形式。因此，通过检查总结工作，开展批评与自我批评，加强群众观念与政策观点，克服单纯任务观点，应作为今后教育干部的经常的重要内容。
    二、下级执行任务中的命令主义和领导上的官僚主义是分不开的。因此，与克服命令主义同时，应注意克服官僚主义。领导上要经常深入下层检查工作，帮助下级解决困难；在总结布置工作时要多倾听下级意见。不然上级布置任务太多太急，下级为了完成任务，命令主义又易滋长。
    三、要开展干部与群众间的批评与自我批评，发动群众来监督干部，保证政策的正确执行。事实证明，整风后已展开了批评与自我批评的地方，工作中发生的错误很快便得到纠正。如刘仓乡邹岐村干部贷豆饼不民主，群众提出了批评以后，偏向很快便纠正了。
