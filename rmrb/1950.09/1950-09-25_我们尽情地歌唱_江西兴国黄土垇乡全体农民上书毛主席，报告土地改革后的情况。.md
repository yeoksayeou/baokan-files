　　"We sing with all our hearts..."
    All the farmers of Huangtu'ao Township, Xingguo, Jiangxi, write to Chairman Mao, reporting on the situation after land reform.
    Dear Chairman Mao:
    We are excited and happy to tell you that the land in our township has been successfully distributed. In accordance with the Land Reform Law, we did not touch the land of rich peasants, and each person received eight *dan* of paddy fields and five *dan* of lumber and peach trees (only two *dou* of paddy fields and three *dou* of mountain land less than if we had touched the rich peasants' land), thus neutralizing the rich peasants and reassuring the middle peasants even more. In the land reform, we clearly saw that the policy of not touching the land of rich peasants was completely correct. This enabled us to complete the land reform faster and more smoothly. Our land distribution and our liberation are all the result of your wise leadership. We are even more reminded that as early as 1928, under your leadership, we overthrew the feudal forces, distributed land, and lived a happy life.
    Chairman Mao, since you led the Red Army north to resist the Japanese, we have been beaten, buried alive, burned, and killed by the enemy (the Kuomintang)...; crazy landlords also took the opportunity to cruelly oppress us, take back the land we had been allocated, and occupy our houses, leaving our wives and children scattered. They gave us the label of "bandits" and arbitrarily arrested and slaughtered us. The six Communist Party members in our village were killed by these cruel landlords. Comrade Cai Xianhan, the women's minister, died the most tragically, being inhumanely strangled to death. The landlords also threatened us by withdrawing land and seizing tenants, using various methods to send the grain we earned in a year of labor into their granaries. We worked desperately every day and still couldn't afford to eat, living an unbearable life. During these years of suffering, we looked forward to your early return every day to lead us in distributing land again. This wish has finally been realized, and our land has returned to our homes for the second time. Now that we have this lifeline, we must cultivate diligently, work hard to improve production, and strive to rapidly improve our lives. Today, all the people in our township are enthusiastically gathering on Songjiang Mountain to celebrate the return of the land to its owners. Red flags are flying, gongs and drums are deafening at the venue, we are shouting with all our hearts, singing with all our hearts, and laughing with all our hearts. In these joyful days, we will tell you about our land reform. We wish you good health!
            All the farmers of Huangtu'ao Township, Xingguo, Jiangxi

### “我们尽情地歌唱……” 江西兴国黄土垇乡全体农民上书毛主席，报告土地改革后的情况。

　　“我们尽情地歌唱……”
    江西兴国黄土垇乡全体农民上书毛主席，报告土地改革后的情况。亲爱的毛主席：
    我们兴奋愉快地告诉您，我们全乡的土地已经胜利地分配好了。我们遵照土地改革法，不动富农的土地，每人分得八担田、五担木桃（比动富农土地只少分二斗田、三斗山），使富农中立，中农更安心了。在土地改革中，我们清楚地看到了不动富农的政策是完全正确的。这使我们更快更顺利地完成了土地改革。我们的分田、我们的翻身，都是您英明领导的结果。我们更想起早在一九二八年，在您的领导下，我们打倒了封建势力，分过田地，过着幸福的日子。
    毛主席，自从您带着红军北上抗日后，我们就被敌人（国民党）吊打、活埋、烧杀……；疯狂的地主也乘机残酷地压迫我们，收回我们分得的土地，霸占我们的房屋，弄得我们妻离子散。他们给我们带一个“土匪”的帽子，就随便逮捕屠杀我们。我们村里的六个共产党员，就被这些狠心的地主所杀害了。妇女部长蔡贤汉同志死的最惨，被他们惨无人道地绞死。地主还用抽地夺佃来威胁我们，用各种方法把我们一年劳动所得的粮食送进他们的谷仓里。我们天天拼命的干，还吃不上饭，过着不能忍受的生活。在这些受苦的岁月里，我们天天盼望着你早日回来，领导我们再分田地。这个愿望终于实现了，我们的土地又第二次回老家了。我们有了这命根子，一定要勤劳耕种，努力把生产搞好，争取我们的生活迅速改善。今天我们全乡群众热烈地集合在松江山上，庆祝土地还家。会场上红旗招展，锣鼓喧天，我们尽情地高呼，尽情地歌唱，尽情地欢笑。在这欢笑的日子里，我们就将我们的土地改革情况告诉你。祝您身体健康！
            江西兴国黄土垇乡全体农民
                        八月二十五日
