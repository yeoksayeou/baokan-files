Xinhua News Agency, 9th. Farmers' associations are flourishing in the vast rural areas of the Central-South, East China, Southwest, and Northwest Administrative Regions.

According to incomplete statistics: farmers' associations in the above-mentioned regions (including seventeen provinces and eight administrative regions equivalent to provinces) already have more than 39,850,000 members. Among them, the Central-South Region has 25,120,000, the East China Region has 10,530,000 (excluding the old liberated areas of Shandong Province), the Southwest Region has more than 2,840,000, and the Northwest Region, according to statistics from the newly liberated areas of Gansu and Shaanxi provinces, has 1,350,000 members. Due to the different times of liberation in various places, the development of farmers' associations in each region is also uneven. Among the above-mentioned regions, Henan and Hunan provinces have the most widespread development of farmers' associations. Henan Province alone has 9,820,000 members (of which 7,300,000 are in areas where land reform has been completed, a previous telegram mistakenly stated that the entire province had 7,300,000). Guizhou, Yunnan, and Xikang provinces in the Southwest Region, and Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia provinces in the Northwest Region, are actively developing or beginning to develop. Most of the seventeen provinces and eight administrative regions have convened provincial (or regional) farmer representative conferences and established provincial farmers' associations or their preparatory committees.

Farmers' Associations Unite the Broad Masses of Farmers, Guaranteeing the Smooth Completion of Social Reforms

Farmers' associations in various places were organized during a series of rural social reforms, such as suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, and land reform, and in rural production movements. In these movements, farmers' associations also exerted great power, guaranteeing the smooth completion of rural social reforms.

First of all, members of farmers' associations in various places actively assisted the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits. They sent letters, acted as guides, and scouted out information for the People's Liberation Army. Especially in clearing out scattered bandits, members of farmers' associations and the broad masses of farmers used various social relationships to win over a large number of bandits to surrender. In the grain requisition work, members of farmers' associations took the lead in paying grain, and also persuaded the landlord class to pay grain. For lawless landlords who resisted the policy of reasonable burden and shifted the burden, the anti-concealed land struggle was launched through the farmers' association, squeezing out a large amount of undeclared land. Farmers' associations further united the broad masses of farmers and launched anti-local bully and rent reduction movements in most areas. Through these struggles, the farmers have become increasingly united, and their awareness has also been increasing. Before this year's wheat harvest, the farmers' association in Henan Province led farmers in half of the province to complete the task of land distribution.

Farmers' associations in various places have gradually assisted the people's government in reforming political power in rural areas, and have made themselves the core of the people's democratic dictatorship in rural areas. Many farmer leaders and farmers' association cadres in various places have been elected by the people as cadres of the people's government. For example, in the past year, the Xuchang Special District of Henan Province has trained more than 10,000 farmer cadres, and some outstanding individuals have been promoted to district chiefs of the people's government. After the establishment of farmers' associations in the Southwest Region, the Baojia system is also being gradually abolished.

Various Localities Are Actively Consolidating Farmers' Associations, Laying the Foundation for Land Reform and Rent Reduction

At present, the areas in East China, Central-South, and Northwest regions with more than 100 million agricultural population preparing to implement land reform this winter, as well as the areas preparing to carry out rent reduction this winter, are actively engaged in the development and consolidation of farmers' associations. Farmers' associations in various places are conducting training cadres and educating members to form a stronger and purer farmer team, and to improve the working ability of farmer association cadres and the political awareness of members, in order to lay the foundation for leading the land reform and rent reduction movement this winter.

In the development process, farmers' associations in various places still have many shortcomings. In many areas, the composition of farmers' associations is not pure enough. A small number of village and township farmers' associations have even been usurped by landlords and bad elements, hindering rural social reforms. For example, in the rural farmers' association organizations in Hunan Province, those usurped by the landlord class and ruffians accounted for about 20% of the province. In Jiangxi Province, about 30% of the rural farmers' association cadres are of impure composition. In the work of establishing and developing farmers' associations, there are tendencies of closed-doorism and formalism in some places. The former is exemplified by the excessively complicated and strict membership procedures in the development of farmers' association organizations in the Eastern Sichuan Administrative Region. In Tongliang County, three forms had to be filled out to develop a member. Some areas have a tendency to exclude middle peasants and poor intellectuals from joining the association, thus weakening the strength of the rural anti-feudal united front. In addition, in some areas, in the development of members, no detailed publicity and education work is done, and even the old Baojia chiefs or farmer representatives are simply ordered to register the roster as members. This is one of the reasons why landlords and ruffians can take the opportunity to infiltrate the farmers' associations.

At present, the vast areas of East China, Central-South, Southwest, and Northwest are consolidating farmers' associations. All localities have grasped the principle of education and transformation in consolidating farmers' associations, distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves, treating them separately, educating cadres or members with good composition but poor style, and resolutely purging class alien elements who have infiltrated farmers' associations. Only false farmers' associations that are entirely organized by landlords and bad elements, and whose composition is largely impure, will be disbanded and reorganized.

### 中南、华东、西南、西北农民协会正在蓬勃发展  十七个省和八个行政区已有会员近四千万  发挥巨大力量成为农村人民民主专政核心

　　中南、华东、西南、西北农民协会正在蓬勃发展
    十七个省和八个行政区已有会员近四千万  发挥巨大力量成为农村人民民主专政核心
    【新华社九日讯】中南、华东、西南和西北四大行政区的广大农村，农民协会正在蓬勃发展中。
    根据不完全的材料统计：上述地区的农民协会（包括十七个省和八个相当于省的行政区）已拥有会员三千九百八十五万余人。其中中南区二千五百一十二万人，华东区一千零五十三万人（不包括山东省的老解放区），西南区二百八十四万多人，西北区甘肃省和陕西省新解放区的统计，有农民协会会员一百三十五万人。由于各地解放先后不同，各地区农民协会的发展也是不平衡的。上述地区以河南、湖南等省农民协会发展最为普遍，仅河南省即有会员九百八十二万人（其中已完成土地改革的地区的七百三十余万人，前电误为全省七百三十余万人）。西南地区的贵州、云南、西康等省，西北地区的新疆、青海、宁夏等省，正在积极发展，或开始发展当中。十七个省和八个行政区，大多已召开过省（或区）农民代表会，成立了省农民协会或其筹备委员会。
    农民协会团结了广大农民  保证社会改革的顺利完成
    各地农民协会都是在剿匪、反恶霸、减租、土地改革等一系列的农村社会改革中，和在农村生产运动中组织起来的。在这些运动中农民协会也发挥出巨大的力量，保证了农村社会改革的顺利完成。
    各地农民协会会员首先积极协助了人民解放军剿匪。他们为人民解放军送信、做向导、侦察匪情。特别是在清剿散匪时，农会会员们和广大农民群众利用了各种社会关系，争取了大批的土匪投降。在征粮工作上，农会会员带头缴粮，同时也说服地主阶级缴粮。对于顽抗合理负担政策和转嫁负担的不法地主，则通过农民协会开展了反瞒田斗争，挤出大量黑地。农民协会更团结了广大农民，在大部分地区内展开了反恶霸、减租运动。经过这些斗争，农民已日益团结起来，他们的觉悟也日益提高。在今年麦收以前，河南省的农民协会，领导该省一半地区的农民完成了分配土地的任务。
    各地农民协会逐步地协助人民政府改造了农村中的政权，并使自己成为农村中人民民主专政的核心。各地许多农民领袖、农民协会干部被人民选为人民政府的干部。如河南省许昌专区一年来即培养了农民干部一万多人，有些优秀分子且被提拔为人民政府的区长。西南地区在农民协会建立后，也正在逐步地废除了保甲制度。
    各地正积极整顿农民协会  为进行土改和减租打基础
    现在，华东、中南和西北准备今冬实行土地改革的一亿余农业人口的地区，以及准备在今冬进行减租的地区，都正在积极从事农民协会的发展和整顿工作。各地农民协会都在进行训练干部、教育会员等工作以便组成一支更加强大而纯洁的农民队伍，并提高农会干部的工作能力和会员群众的政治觉悟，为领导今冬的土地改革和减租运动打下基础。
    各地农民协会在发展过程中，还有不少缺点。许多地区农民协会的成份还不够纯洁，少数村、乡农民协会甚至为地主及坏分子所篡窃，阻碍农村的社会改革。如湖南省的乡村农协组织中，被地主阶级和流氓分子所篡窃的，竟约占全省的百分之二十。江西省也有约百分之三十的乡村农民协会干部成份不纯。在建立和发展农会的工作中，某些地方有关门主义和形式主义的偏向。前者如川东行政区在发展农民协会的组织中，入会手续过于复杂和严格。铜梁县发展一个会员要填三张表格。若干地区有排斥中农和贫苦知识分子入会的偏向，因而削弱了农村反封建统一战线的力量。此外，有些地区在发展会员中，不做细致的宣传教育工作，甚至只简单地命令旧保甲长或者农民代表登记名册当作会员。这是使地主、流氓等得以乘机混入农民协会的原因之一。
    现在，华东、中南、西南、西北的广大地区都在整顿农民协会。各地整顿农民协会均掌握了以教育、改造为主的方针，分清敌我，加以分别对待，对成份好但作风不良的干部或会员，进行教育；对混入农民协会的阶级异己分子，则坚决清洗。只有完全是地主、坏分子组织的，绝大部分成份不纯的假农会，才予以解散，另行组织。
