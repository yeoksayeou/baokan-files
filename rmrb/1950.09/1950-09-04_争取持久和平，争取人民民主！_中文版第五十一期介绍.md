　　Xinhua News Agency, September 3rd: "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, Issue 51 (General Issue 90) has been published.

　　The editorial in this issue, "Two Worlds – Two Policies," points out: Stalin's reply to Indian Prime Minister Nehru on July 18 regarding the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue is another powerful proof of the Soviet Union's consistent peace policy and a concrete manifestation of the peace-loving actions of the great socialist regime. The editorial points out: The Korean situation clearly demonstrates two policies and two lines on the international battleground: one is the policy of the democratic and anti-imperialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, the foundation of which is the recognition of the equal status of all nations and respect for the freedom and autonomy of each nation; the other is the policy of the imperialist camp, led by American imperialism. The editorial concludes by emphasizing that, given the intensification of the war crisis and the direct acts of aggression taken by American imperialism, the democratic camp must be further strengthened and consolidated, and supporters of the forces of peace must be more united. A fundamental condition for curbing the instigation of new wars is to strive to expand the mass base of the peace movement, bringing broad masses of peasants, urban middle class, women and youth, and all intellectuals into the Stockholm Peace Petition movement, to increase practical actions against the bloody adventures of imperialism. Hundreds of millions of good people in all countries of the world will shatter the evil plans of the imperialists and block the road to war!

　　This issue of the journal is titled "American Troops Get Out of Korea!" and provides comprehensive coverage of protests from people around the world against the bloody war of aggression launched by American imperialism in Korea.

　　This issue of the journal publishes important essays such as "The Six-Year Plan for Poland's Economic Development and Laying the Socialist Foundation" by Minc, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, and "The Labor Law of the Romanian People's Republic" by Apostol, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party.

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！” 
    中文版第五十一期介绍
    【新华社三日讯】“争取持久和平，争取人民民主!”中文版第五十一期（总第九十期）已经出版。
    该刊本期社论《两个世界——两种政策》指出：七月十八日斯大林对印度尼赫鲁总理关于朝鲜问题和平解决的答复，是苏联一贯的和平政策的又一有力的证明，是伟大社会主义政权爱好和平的行动又一具体表现。社论指出：朝鲜的事情明确地表现了国际斗争战场上的两种政策，两条路线：一个是以伟大苏联为首的民主、反帝阵营的政策，这个政策的基础是承认所有民族的平等地位，并尊重各个民族的自由与自主；另外便是帝国主义阵营的政策，其中以美国帝国主义为主导力量。社论最后着重指出，鉴于战争危机的尖锐化，及美帝国主义采取了直接进行侵略战争行为，民主阵营更须加强巩固，和平势力的支持者更须团结。遏止挑拨新的战争之一个基本条件，是尽力扩大和平运动的群众基础，把广大的农民群众，城市中产阶层，妇女及青年，以及知识分子全体吸到斯德哥尔摩和平签名运动中来，以便增加反对帝国主义血腥冒险的实际行动。世界各国亿万善良人民将击破帝国主义者的罪恶计划，将战争的道路堵住！
