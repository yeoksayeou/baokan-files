　　Strengthening Guidance and Management of Production by Government Agencies
    Beijing Municipality Handles Registration of Agency Production
    [Beijing News Agency] In order to strengthen guidance and management of production by government agencies, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to handle the registration of all government agency-run industrial and mining enterprises within the urban area, starting from September 11th.

    The industrial and mining enterprises operated in the urban area of Beijing by government agencies, military units, schools, and mass organizations at all levels, including those jointly operated with private capital, total approximately two hundred. Except for about thirty mining enterprises, most of which have already registered for business, only one hundred and two industrial enterprises have registered for business, and even among these, some factory and mining registration items have changed, such as changes in affiliation or relocation of address, without any change registration being carried out. The registration report forms filled out at the time of registration are also mostly not detailed and accurate enough. This makes it difficult for the municipal government to understand the production capacity and production and sales situation of agency production, and therefore, it is not easy to give appropriate guidance. Therefore, the municipal government has now formulated an investigation form for industrial and mining enterprises run by government agencies to conduct a more detailed and comprehensive survey of all factories and mines, both unregistered and registered.

    The registration period is one month. Factories and mines that fail to register within the deadline will be subject to suspension of business by the government.

　　加强对机关生产的指导与管理
    京市办理机关生产登记
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府为加强对机关生产的指导和管理，决定自九月十一日起办理市区以内所有机关生产工矿企业的登记。
    各级政府机关、部队、学校和群众团体在北京市区内经营的工矿企业，包括与私人资本合营的在内，共约二百多户。除矿业约三十户大部已经办理营业登记外，工业只有一百零二户办理过营业登记，且其中还有一部分厂矿的登记事项已经变更，如改变隶属关系或迁移地址等，也没有办理变更登记；登记时填报的登记报告表也多不够详细确切。这就使市政府不易了解机关生产的生产能力和产销情况，因之，也就不易给以适当的指导。因此市政府现又制订了机关生产工矿企业调查表，对未登记的和已登记的一切厂矿进行一次比较详尽的普遍调查。
    这次登记的期限为一个月，逾期不办理登记的厂矿，政府得停止其营业。
