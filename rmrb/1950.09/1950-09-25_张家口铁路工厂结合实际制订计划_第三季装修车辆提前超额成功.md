　　Zhangjiakou Railway Factory Combines Theory and Practice to Formulate a Plan:
    Third Quarter Renovation of Vehicles Completed Ahead of Schedule and Above Target
    [Reported from Zhangjiakou by this newspaper] The Zhangjiakou Railway Factory of the Tianjin Railway Administration completed the vehicle task for the third quarter ahead of schedule and above target. The third quarter (July, August, and September) freight car repair task set by the Ministry of Railways was 24 dead repairs and 15 bureau repairs, totaling 39 vehicles, equivalent to 66.8 general overhauls. However, in July and August, 12 rebuilds, 5 dead repairs, and 11 bureau repairs had already been completed, totaling 28 vehicles, equivalent to 73.3 general overhauls. Calculated by the conversion rate, the task was completed 10 percent ahead of schedule and above target. This is mainly because the workshop played a central role, going deep into the field to rely on the masses, formulating a plan that combined theory and practice, and constantly communicating with the field to solve problems in a timely manner. In the past, planning was done by the workshop and section chiefs alone, simply picking out the vehicle numbers to be repaired and subjectively estimating the completion date based on working hours. As a result, it was rare to achieve the plan. Since July, the method of making plans has been changed. In the last ten days of the previous month, the workshop first selects the vehicle numbers to be repaired based on the damage status table of the incoming vehicles, then goes deep into the field to inspect each vehicle with the section chief, and then convenes the relevant group leaders and inspection personnel to conduct group investigations, deciding on the spot where to repair, what to replace, and how to repair. The workshop then formulates a preliminary plan based on the number of construction days required by the main groups, prints it, and distributes it to the field. After discussion by each group, if there are any inappropriate points, they are slightly modified, and then the plan is implemented. Every Saturday, the workshop holds a vehicle meeting to check work progress and solve special problems. At other times, it constantly communicates with the field to understand the work situation at any time and solve all work-related problems in a timely manner. In terms of material supply, the workshop takes the initiative to estimate the materials to be used on site, lists them, and sends them to the material room for purchase, and is often responsible for supervising and urging. After the materials arrive, the site is immediately notified to issue a requisition form, and the transport group is contacted to deliver them to the site, saving the technicians' time to collect materials.

　　张家口铁路工厂结合实际制订计划
    第三季装修车辆提前超额成功
    【本报张家口讯】天津铁路管理局张家口铁路工厂提前超额完成第三季车辆任务。第三季（七、八、九三月）货车修复任务；铁道部定为死复二十四辆，局修十五辆，计三十九辆，折合一般大修六六·八。但在七、八两个月内已完成了重造十二辆，死复五辆，局修十一辆，计二十八辆，折合大修七三·三，以折合率计算，提前超额完成任务百分之十。这主要是由于工作室发挥了核心作用，深入现场依靠群众，订出结合实际的计划，并不断与现场联系及时解决问题。过去订计划都是由工作室与所主任单纯的挑出拟修复的车号，主观的依照工时估计出厂日期，结果很少能够按计划实现。自七月份起，改变了订计划的办法，在前一个月下旬，即由工作室首先根据入厂车的破损状态表，选择出拟修的车号，再深入现场会同所主任按号逐车考察，然后召集有关各组长及检查负责人员，施行小组调查，当时决定何处修，何处换，以及如何修法等问题。再由工作室根据主要小组需用之施工日数，订出初步计划，油印后发到现场，经过各小组讨论，如有不适当的即略加修改后，即依计划进行。并于每星期六，由工作室召开车辆会议一次，检查工作进度，解决特殊问题。平时则经常不断的与现场联系，随时了解工作情况，及时解决一切有关工作的问题，在材料供应方面，工作室在每次计划决定之后，就主动的估计了现场应用的料，列单送到材料室去购置，经常负责督催。材料来到后就立刻通知现场出领单；并连系运搬组给送到现场去，以节省技工取料的时间。（浮云）
