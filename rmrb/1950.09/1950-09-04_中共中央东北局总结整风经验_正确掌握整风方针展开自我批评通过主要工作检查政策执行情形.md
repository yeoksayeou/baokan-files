　　The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee Summarizes Rectification Experiences
    Correctly Grasps the Rectification Policy, Launches Self-Criticism, and Reviews Policy Implementation Through Major Work Inspections
    [News from this newspaper] According to the Northeast Daily, the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a meeting of party member cadres from directly affiliated organs and Shenyang City on August 23rd. Comrade Zhang Mingyuan reported on the main experiences of the previous period's rectification:
    First, it is necessary to repeatedly mobilize cadres to ensure that everyone deeply understands the Northeast Bureau's rectification policy and conducts rectification based on this correct policy. This is the key to the success or failure of rectification. Based on the previous stage of rectification, units that have grasped the rectification policy stipulated by the Northeast Bureau, using criticism and self-criticism, and inspecting major work, have achieved more results, initially solved some problems, and improved the understanding and confidence of cadres. Units that have not grasped this policy, or have conducted rectification in a formalistic manner, or have messed up the steps, have experienced deviations and need to be corrected immediately.
    In some units, cadres still have incorrect understanding and attitudes towards rectification: some do not understand that rectification is an important link in promoting current work, thus they separate rectification from work, even treating it as a task given by the higher authorities, turning it into a work burden. Some are limited by narrow experience; when rectification is mentioned, they start from inspecting individuals. They don't know how to use the new rectification method, which is to check the implementation of policies and work styles through major work.
    In order to correct the above deviations, rectification must be carried out with focus and in a step-by-step manner. Don't check too many issues, and don't try to solve all the problems at once. Be good at grasping the key points, and solve other problems incidentally by solving the main problems. For example, there are many problems in industrial construction today, and it is impossible to solve all of them in rectification. The industrial work conference solved the problem of business management in industrial production, which grasped the main problem. Once this problem is solved, other problems will be easier to solve. At the same time, the inspection must be in-depth, analytical, and summarized. Some units also check work, but it is very formal, lacking analysis, simply listing a lot of phenomena, so naturally nothing can be solved. This urgently needs to be corrected.
    Second, correctly use criticism and self-criticism, and fully promote democracy. At present, this is not done well enough. In the future, on the one hand, we must correct the phenomenon of leaders being afraid to promote democracy. In some units, cadres ask the leaders to state their position and make rules, which shows that the leaders were not democratic in the past and must be corrected. On the other hand, we must also correct democracy without leadership, only calling on everyone to make suggestions without indicating a clear direction, not praising correct opinions, and not criticizing wrong opinions. This will lead to the phenomenon of extreme democracy, vulgarizing criticism and self-criticism.
    Some individual units mechanically separate criticism and self-criticism, only criticizing others and not examining themselves, attributing all shortcomings to superiors and subordinates, completely exonerating themselves. Some only make self-criticism without mutual criticism, and do not raise opinions among themselves. Some are not active in rectification and take a bystander attitude. These are all wrong and should be corrected. There are even individual comrades who have impure motives, thinking that rectification is a good opportunity to take revenge and settle old scores. Focusing on people and not on matters is completely wrong and should be resolutely corrected.
    When carrying out criticism and self-criticism, the leadership should well grasp its development law. Generally, when starting the review, some cadres will have some concerns, and we must find ways to eliminate their concerns. When criticism unfolds, some wrong opinions may arise, and the leadership should be good at guiding everyone to develop in the correct direction. This will neither dampen everyone's enthusiasm nor clarify right and wrong, allowing criticism and self-criticism to unfold smoothly.
    Third, through the rectification movement of inspecting work, establish a systematic work inspection system and establish a regular and unremitting style of criticism and self-criticism. The gains of the movement should be consolidated with necessary systems. Establishing a regular work inspection system is the best way to overcome bureaucracy. Criticism and self-criticism should become a regular part of party life. The phenomenon of some responsible cadres not participating in branch life in the past should be corrected.
    Fourth, rectification must establish a leadership core, and consensus should be reached within the core on various opinions on rectification. The rectification of enterprises in the city should be led by the Municipal Party Committee, but it must be combined with administrative work to ensure the implementation of rectification requirements. The core of rectification in factories and mines should be the Party Committee with the participation of the factory director, while administratively, the Standing Committee of the Management Committee should be the core, with the factory and mine directors as the main leaders within the core.
    Fifth, grasp the progress of rectification, provide specific guidance in a timely manner, analyze the situation, and raise questions to move the movement in the correct direction. Meetings must be fully prepared and must solve problems. After the preliminary rectification of the main leading cadres comes to an end, it is necessary to drive the rectification of general cadres. The second step should focus on leading the rectification of various counties, provincial and municipal organs, various departments and bureaus, sections and offices, and various factories and mines. Each rectification unit should summarize the experience of the previous stage to guide the next step of rectification.

### 中共中央东北局总结整风经验  正确掌握整风方针展开自我批评通过主要工作检查政策执行情形

　　中共中央东北局总结整风经验
    正确掌握整风方针展开自我批评通过主要工作检查政策执行情形
    【本报讯】据东北日报消息：中共中央东北局于八月二十三日，召集直属各机关及沈阳市党员干部会，由张明远同志报告前一时期整风的主要经验：
    第一、首先要在干部中反复进行动员，使大家都能深切了解东北局的整风方针，并根据这一正确方针来进行整风。这是整风进行好坏的关键。根据前一段整风情况来看，凡是掌握了东北局所规定的整风方针，以批评和自我批评的方式，以检查主要工作来进行整风的单位，都收到了较多的成绩，初步解决了一些问题，提高了干部的认识与信心。凡是未掌握这一方针的单位，或者是形式主义地进行整风，或者搞乱了步骤，都发生了偏差，需要立即纠正。
    在某些单位中，干部还存在对整风不正确的认识和态度：有的不了解整风是推动目前工作的重要环节，因而脱离工作进行整风，甚至当成上级所给的任务，变成工作负担。有的被狭隘的经验所限制，一提整风，就从检查个人作起；对新的整风方法，即通过主要工作来检查政策的执行与作风，则不会运用。
    为了纠正上述偏向，必须有重点、有步骤地进行整风。检查的问题不要太多，不要企图一下子解决所有的问题，要善于抓住要害，通过解决主要问题把其他问题也附带求得解决。比如今天工业建设中的问题很多，不可能在整风中一个一个都得到解决。工业工作会议解决了工业生产的经营管理问题，这是抓住了主要问题，这个问题解决了，其他问题也就较容易解决。同时检查要深入，要有分析，有总结。有些单位也检查工作，但是很形式，缺乏分析，现象罗列一大堆，结果自然不能解决什么问题。这是急需改正的。
    第二、要正确运用批评与自我批评，充分发扬民主。目前这点作得还很不够。今后必须一方面要纠正领导上不敢发扬民主的现象，有的单位干部要求领导上表明态度，约法几章，这说明领导上过去不民主，必须纠正。另方面也要纠正没有领导的民主，只号召大家提意见，而不指示明确方向，对的意见不加表扬，错的意见不加批判，这样就会发生极端民主的现象，把批评与自我批评庸俗化了。
    有个别单位把批评与自我批评机械分开，只批评别人，不检查自己，缺点一律归咎于上级和下级，自己脱的一干二净。有的只作自我批评，而没互相批评，彼此间有意见不提出。有的对整风不积极，采取旁观态度。这都是不应该的，应当纠正。还有个别同志，甚至动机不纯，认为整风是个好机会，企图乘机报复算旧账。对人不对事，这是完全错误的，应当坚决改正。
    在开展批评与自我批评时，领导上应很好掌握其发展规律。一般开始检讨时，有些干部会有些顾虑，必须设法消除他们的顾虑。当批评展开后，可能发生若干错误意见，领导上应当善于引导大家向正确方面发展。这样既不挫伤大家积极性，又能弄清是非，使批评与自我批评顺利展开。
    第三、通过检查工作的整风运动，建立系统的检查工作制度，树立经常不懈的批评与自我批评的作风。运动的收获，要用必要的制度把它巩固起来。建立经常的检查工作制度，是克服官僚主义的最好办法。要把批评与自我批评变成党内生活的经常内容。过去有些负责干部不过支部生活的现象应当纠正。
    第四、整风要建立领导核心，对整风的各种意见，应首先在核心中取得一致。城市中各企业的整风，应由市委领导，但一定要与行政上结合起来，保证整风要求的贯彻。在厂矿中的整风核心应该是有厂长参加的党委会，行政上则应以管委会常委为核心，在核心内应以厂矿长为主。
    第五、要掌握整风进度，及时加以具体指导，分析情况，提出问题，使运动朝正确方向前进。会议必须有充分准备，必须解决问题，在主要领导干部初步整风告一段落之后，就要带动一般干部整风。第二步应以领导各县、省市机关各厅局处科与各厂矿的整风为主。各整风单位应总结前一段经验，指导下一步的整风。
