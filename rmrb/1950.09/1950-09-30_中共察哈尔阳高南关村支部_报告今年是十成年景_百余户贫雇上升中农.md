　　CPC Chahar Yanggao Nanguan Village Branch
    Reports This Year is a Ten-Year Harvest
    Over a Hundred Impoverished and Hired Laborers Rise to Middle Peasants

    [This newspaper reports] The entire membership of the Chinese Communist Party's Nanguan Village Branch in Yanggao County, Chahar Province, wrote to Chairman Mao on the eve of National Day, reporting on their efforts to lead the village farmers in overcoming difficulties and striving for production, resulting in a ten-year harvest. They also examined shortcomings in their work, promising to improve their methods in the future, leading the entire village to 100% completion of autumn plowing and grain delivery, with no idle villagers this winter. They also pledge to strengthen Party member education, strive to unite the masses, and do a good job in production, to achieve the goal of everyone living a good life. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    We, the entire membership of the Communist Party branch of Nanguan Village, Yanggao County, are reporting to you on the production work of the spring, summer, and autumn seasons this year in commemoration of the October 1st National Day. Our Nanguan is an agricultural street with a total of 236 households and 1,207 people. There are 332 full laborers, 150 semi-laborers, and 31 Party members. Now we have 314.5 mu of garden land and 1,574.1 mu of dry land. Some of these lands were distributed during the land reform. In the past, the whole village only had 114.5 mu of garden land and 874.1 mu of dry land. One hundred and eighty-three impoverished and hired peasant households used to rent land from landlords in the city, working hard all year round but unable to eat their fill or clothe themselves warmly. Since the implementation of land reform the year before last, landless and land-poor peasants have gained land, and have turned over politically and economically. Party members took the lead, leading the masses to actively produce, work diligently, promote technology, reclaim wasteland, apply more manure, buy livestock, and increase agricultural implements. This year, agricultural production has exceeded the pre-war level. The masses said, "We haven't seen such a bumper year in over twenty years; it is because of the good leadership of the Communist Party." This glorious title belongs to Chairman Mao; it is also the glory of the people of Nanguan. This year, we have achieved a ten-year harvest, increasing grain production by more than 1,400 dan (converted to grain) compared to last year's seventy percent. The masses in the whole village have enough to eat and wear. This year, all 181 impoverished and hired peasant households have risen to the level of middle peasants. Cao Pi, Zhang Youyi, and Wang Zhiguo all harvested half as much grain more than last year. Zhang Shengtang and Li Qishun, two layabouts who did not engage in production in the past, later joined the labor exchange groups under the leadership of Party members, and are now reformed into people who love labor. They plant crops very well. Li Qishun alone can harvest three or four dan of grain. Although they have not reached the level of middle peasants, they will not lack food and clothing this year.

  Party Members Lead the Masses in Seed Soaking, Gaining Enthusiastic Support from the Masses

    The entire membership of Nanguan Village responded to your call, leading the masses to strive to restore pre-war production levels. All the land last year was cultivated. This spring, more than 600 mu were harrowed and plowed, resulting in frost protection, seedling establishment, and good crop growth. The masses in the whole village all happily said, "Who wouldn't do this good thing? This year, we will cultivate the land early, even if we are not told to do so." New technologies were widely promoted. When soaking seeds, some people did not believe it, fearing that they would be burned to death and unable to sprout. First, the thinking of the Party members was unified, implemented within the Party, and then publicized and explained to the masses. Party members Li Sheng and Lü Shengrui helped each household soak seeds with thermometers. During the sowing of the large fields, 163 households soaked their seeds. Now, in comparison, the stalks are strong, the ears are large, and the plants are round. People in other villages reflect that seed soaking is not effective. The people in our village say that not only do the crops grow well, but as long as you soak them according to the standard of two parts boiling water and one part cold water, they will not become moldy. Zhang Sanwa's crops were moldy, saying that seed soaking was not effective. As a result of inspection, it was still because he did not believe it and was afraid of burning the seeds to death, so he used too much cold water. With such a demonstration, the masses said, "Let's do it! It's never wrong to follow the Communist Party." The whole village added five waterwheels (three borrowed, two bought). During spring plowing and sowing, livestock were lacking. In order to plant early and seize the frost, the seventeen labor exchange groups with eighty-eight people were all mobilized, organizing human and animal cooperation, people pulling plows, people pulling seeders, for cultivation and sowing, completing the cultivation and sowing tasks in ten days. At the beginning of summer weeding, because this year the seedlings were dense and there was heavy rain and weeds, ideological mobilization was carried out to promote the labor exchange groups to actively weed the fields, and no one's crops were neglected. More than 140 women participated in weeding the fields. Sweet potatoes and millet were all weeded three times, and barley and soybeans were weeded four times. The whole village added 1,400 large carts of fertilizer, an average of one cart per mu of paddy field and half a cart per mu of dry land. Zhang An and Zhang Youyi fertilized an average of three carts per mu, and Sun Ai fertilized fourteen carts on two mu of garden land, harvesting more than four dan more grain than last year. Two hundred and eighty mu of new wasteland were reclaimed, which can increase grain by eighty dan. Party members Wang Zhiguo and Zhao Guanguan reclaimed forty-two mu of wasteland, increasing grain by more than ten dan. Lu Gui reclaimed one mu of wasteland to plant broomcorn millet, harvesting eight dou. The masses said, "You don't need to urge us to reclaim more wasteland (referring to cadres). No taxes, no corvée, and the grain harvested belongs to us. Who wouldn't do this business!" The village added 552 major agricultural implements, and increased livestock by twelve heads within a year. Party members Zhang Wanxiao, Meng Xi, and others bought six heads of livestock. In July, when they were weeding the fields, rumors of "cutting off testicles" spread throughout the district, and the masses were panicked about production. Our village held a branch meeting and a village representative meeting to discuss and study according to the instructions from the higher authorities, and came up with a way to put out the rumors. Party members went to households to publicize and explain, and stood up for the masses. More than 40 young and middle-aged people were organized to take up weapons and take turns on duty every night, and the masses were relieved. After only one rumor, it did not happen again, and the rumor was put out from then on.

  Organize Sideline Occupations Before Autumn Harvest, Grasp Autumn Harvest and Autumn Plowing Tightly

    The masses were relieved to engage in production and successfully completed the task of weeding three times. After putting down their hoes, it was still a long time before the autumn harvest. Except for a few people running transportation and sales, most people did nothing. Party members took the lead in organizing 153 households and more than 300 people to collect grass and firewood, fully preparing winter fuel and grass for livestock. In half a month, they collected a total of 158,000 jin of grass. Lü Shengrui and Lü Cai's households collected 15,000 jin of grass. Before the autumn harvest started, a branch meeting and a people's representative meeting were convened to arrange autumn production work, harvest one piece when it's ripe, select seeds on one piece, plow one piece as it's harvested. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, ninety-two households selected 14 shi, 8 dou and 8 sheng of seeds in three days. As of the 24th of this month, sweet potatoes, millet, and broomcorn millet have been harvested. Only more than 300 mu of sorghum remain to be harvested. Now our work focus has shifted from autumn harvest to autumn plowing, organizing twenty cattle yokes to fully harness up and seize the season to launch a blitz of autumn plowing.

    Because we carried out rectification last winter, appropriately returning the things that infringed on the middle peasants through consultation, the middle peasants felt very satisfied. Party members also often encouraged their production enthusiasm. Because the production policy was grasped correctly, people from all strata actively labored in production, without any ideological concerns, and bought houses, land, and livestock one after another. Duan Shengxi bought a house with seven shi of rice, and the people who had been struggled against also actively labored after being reformed. Zhang Wenhuan bought a leather cart, and Ma Tinglong bought a leather cart with two million yuan.

  Insist on Studying, There are Achievements, Most of the Illiteracy in the Party has been Eliminated

    Our branch grasps learning very tightly, insists on holding Party classes once a week, Party members read newspapers in the literacy classes, leading everyone to study. Within a year, more than half of the illiteracy within the Party has been eliminated. Only Li Gendong and Dong Danv (elderly) are not willing to actively learn and know few words. Other Party members know two or three hundred new characters. Li Sheng, Lü Shengrui, and Zhang Youlu had never gone to school for a day and were illiterate. After a year of study, they can not only fill out household registrations and keep accounts, but also write reports to the district. These are our work achievements in less than a year.

    In addition, we still have several major shortcomings: We have too little inspection of our work. For example, this year we planted more than 30,000 trees, but the survival rate is only more than half. At the beginning of seed soaking, we did a poor job of patiently persuading the masses. Some people are dissatisfied with our way of working; now we can forgive each other. There are deviations in learning, and the leadership does not pay enough attention to reading newspapers in the literacy classes. In addition to striving to overcome the above shortcomings, we must also guarantee the following work: 1. Change the way of working, do not force, persuade more, mobilize all the cattle yokes in the village to fully harness up, and complete autumn plowing 100% ahead of schedule. 2. Educate the masses to harvest grain well, mill rice well, and prepare to deliver public grain, ensure good quality, deliver quickly, and not owe a single grain. 3. This winter, ensure that there are no idle people in the village. In addition to people and animals working together to run transportation and sales, organize carrying sand to fill the tidal flats, and mobilize women, children, and semi-laborers to collect firewood and pick up manure. 4. The branch must strengthen the education of Party members, first establish a regular learning system, promote democracy, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and work harder to unite the masses, do a good job in production, to achieve prosperity through hard work, improve life, and enable everyone to live a good life. I wish you good health!

　　中共察哈尔阳高南关村支部
    报告今年是十成年景
    百余户贫雇上升中农
    【本报讯】中国共产党察哈尔省阳高县南关村支部全体党员于国庆前夕上书毛主席，报告今年他们领导全村农民克服困难努力生产，使收获达十成年景的经过情形，并检查出工作中的缺点，保证今后改进工作方法，领导全村百分之百地完成秋耕、缴粮，今冬村中无闲人。并加强党员教育，努力团结群众搞好生产，以达到人人把光景过好的目标。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    我们阳高县南关村共产党支部全体党员，为了纪念十月一日国庆日，向您报告今年春、夏、秋三季的生产工作。我们南关是条农业街，全街二百三十六户，一千二百零七口人。整劳力三百三十二个，半劳力一百五十个，党员三十一个。现在有园子地三百一十四亩五分、旱地一千五百七十四亩一分。这些土地有一部分是土改时分到的，过去全村只有园子地一百一十四亩五分、旱地八百七十四亩一分。有一百八十三户贫雇农都是租佃城内地主的土地耕种，成年劳苦却吃不饱饭，穿不上衣。自前年实行了土改，无地少地贫雇农都得到了土地，政治上、经济上都翻了身。党员带头先干，领导群众积极生产、勤劳耕作、推广技术、开荒、多上粪、买牲口、增农具等。今年农业生产超过了战前水平。群众说：“二十余年没见过今年这个丰收年，就是共产党领导的好。”，这个光荣的称誉是毛主席的光荣；也是南关人民的光荣。今年达到十成收成，比去年七成多增产粮食一千四百余石（折谷）。全村群众都有吃有穿了，一百八十一户贫雇农今年一年全上升到中农。曹丕、张有义、王治国都比去年多打一半粮。张生堂、李七顺两个二流子，过去不生产，后来由党员带动参加了拨工组，现在也改造成爱劳动的人了。庄稼种得很好，李七顺一口人能打三、四石粮。虽然没达到中农，今年也吃穿不缺了。
  党员领导群众浸种获得群众热烈拥护
    南关村全体党员响应您的号召，领导群众为恢复战前生产水平而努力。去年的土地全部耕过，今春普遍耙磨翻过六百余亩，得到了保霜、作苗、庄稼长得好的效果。全村群众都喜欢地说：“照这好事谁不办，今年不说也要早耕地。”普遍推广新技术，在浸种时有些群众还不相信，怕烧死出不了芽，首先打通了党员的思想，从党内贯彻，然后向群众宣传解释，党员李生、吕生瑞拿着温度计帮助各户浸种。大田播种时一百六十三户全部浸了种。现在一比，秸杆长得硬、穗大、棵圆。其他村群众反映浸种不顶事，我们村群众说：不但庄稼长得好，只要按两开水、一冷水的标准浸，就不起霉，张三娃庄稼有霉，说浸种不顶事，结果一检查，还是因为他不相信，怕烧死，用的冷水多了。这样一证明，群众说：“干吧！跟上共产党走没个错。”全村增加水车五辆（贷的三、买的二），春耕播种时，牲口缺乏，为了早种抢霜，将十七个拨工组、八十八个人都推动起来，组织了人畜合犋，人拉犁、人拉耧，进行耕播，十天时间全部完成耕播任务。夏锄一开始，因为今年苗稠雨大草丛，即进行了思想动员，推动了拨工组积极锄地，谁的庄稼也没有荒了。有一百四十多个妇女参加了锄田、山药、谷子全部锄了三遍，大麦、大豆锄了四遍，全村增加肥料一千四百大车，平均水地每亩增加一车、旱地一亩增加半车，张安、张有义每亩平均增肥三车，孙艾二亩园地上粪十四车，比去年多打粮四石多。新开荒地二百八十亩，能增加八十大石粮，党员王治国、赵官官二人开荒四十二亩，增加十余石粮，鲁贵开荒一亩种黍打了八大斗。群众说：“再开荒不用你们督促（指干部），不征税不应差，打上粮食归自己，这买卖谁也做哩！”村中新添主要农具五百五十二件，一年内增加了牲口十二头，党员张万孝、孟习等五人，买了六头牲口，七月间正在锄田时，全区都发生了“割蛋”的谣言，群众对生产惶惶不安。我们村开了支部会、村代表会，根据上级的指示进行讨论研究，想出了扑灭谣言的办法。党员分头深入到户宣传解释，给群众做主。又组织了青壮年四十余人拿起了武器，每晚轮流值班下夜，群众才放心下来，只谣传一次后就没有再发生，从此就把谣言扑灭了。
  秋前组织搞副业秋收秋耕抓得紧
    群众安心生产起来，顺利完成了全部锄三遍的任务。放下锄头，离秋收还很远，除少数人跑运销外，大部分没做的。党员带头组织一百五十三户、三百余人打草打柴，充分准备冬天燃料和牲口喂草，半个月共打草十五万八千斤。吕生瑞、吕才两户打草一万五千斤。秋收未开始就召开了支部大会、人民代表会、布置了秋季生产工作，熟一片、选一片；收一片、耕一片。秋收一开始有九十二户三天选种十四石八斗八升，截至本月二十四日止山药、谷子、黍子收割完了。就余下三百多亩高粱还未收割。现在我们工作重点由秋收转向秋耕，组织二十犋牛犋全上套，抓紧季节突击秋耕地。
    由于我们去冬进行了纠偏，将侵犯中农的东西以协商态度适当给退回，使中农感到非常满意。党员又经常鼓励着他们的生产情绪，因为生产政策掌握得端正，各阶层人民都积极劳动生产，丝毫没有了思想顾虑，纷纷买房、买地、买牲口。段生喜用七石米买房一所，被斗户经过改造也积极劳动起来。张文焕又买皮车一辆，马廷龙用二百万款买皮车去了。
  坚持学习有了成绩党内文盲大半消灭
    我们支部学习抓得很紧，每星期坚持上党课一次，党员在民校读报、带动大家学习，一年内党内的文盲消灭一半多。只有李艮栋、董大女（年老）不肯积极学习识的字少，其它党员都识二、三百生字。李生、吕生瑞、张有禄，过去没上过一天学不识字，经过一年的学习，不但能填户口、记账、还给区里写报告。这是我们不到一年的工作成绩。
    此外，我们还存在着几个大缺点：对工作检查少，如今年植树三万多棵，成活率只有一半多。浸种开始时向群众耐心说服做得差，有的群众对我们工作方式不满；现在已能互相原谅。学习上有偏差，领导上对民校读报不够重视。除努力克服以上缺点外，我们还要保证做到以下工作：一、改变工作方式，不强迫、多说服、动员全村牛犋全上套，百分之百提前完或秋耕地。二、教育群众收好粮、碾好米、准备交公粮，保证质量好、交得快，一粒也不欠。三、今冬做到全村没闲人，除了人畜合伙跑运销外，组织担沙垫滩地，发动妇女儿童半劳力打柴拾粪。四、支部要加强党员的教育，首先建立正轨的学习制度，发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评，更要努力团结群众，搞好生产，达到勤劳致富，改善生活，人人把光景过好。祝您身体健康！
            中共阳高南关村支部全体党员
                         九月二十五日
