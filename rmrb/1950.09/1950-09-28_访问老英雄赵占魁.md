Visiting Old Hero Zhao Zhankui
    Ai Fang
    On the eve of the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, this reporter visited Comrade Zhao Zhankui, an old hero and representative attending the conference, in Xi'an. I agreed on a time with him beforehand on the phone, and he said, "Let's make it twelve o'clock tomorrow! Because I need to hold a meeting first to let everyone give me more suggestions, then it will be better to talk." How sincere and responsible his words were!
    The next day, I met him as scheduled in his office. He is a kind old man. During the conversation, he fully revealed that he has a strong will. He is already fifty-four years old this year, his hair is gray, and the deep, powerful wrinkles on his forehead and the corners of his eyes depict his decades of hard work.
  Zhao Zhankui's Path
    He talked about his life of labor. His family was in a rural village in Dingxiang County, Shanxi. His family was a poor peasant. Unable to maintain a livelihood under the high pressure and exploitation of the landlords, he left home at the age of seventeen to become an apprentice blacksmith. Later, he drifted to Taiyuan, and until 1938, he worked in the copper coin factory, the Taiyuan Arsenal, and the Tongpu Railway. After the Japanese invaders occupied Taiyuan, he and other workers from the Tongpu Railway went to Yan'an together. In May 1938, he entered the Anwu Youth Training Class and later transferred to the Yan'an Workers' School. In 1939, he voluntarily requested to work in the Yan'an Agricultural Implement Factory. This was a factory that manufactured agricultural implements and munitions, and he made great contributions here. Because he was able to overcome all difficulties to complete tasks and was good at leading everyone, everyone learned from him. Under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the famous Zhao Zhankui Movement was launched in Yan'an in 1943. This was a mass production movement. In 1948, he participated in the Sixth National Labor Congress. From 1949 to 1950, he was successively elected as a representative of the People's Political Consultative Conference, a standing committee member of the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions, and the Central People's Government appointed him as Deputy Minister of the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee.
  Heroic Deeds in Production
    He went from the Workers' School to the Agricultural Implement Factory. Here, he was first tested for his selfless work ethic and amazing labor enthusiasm. At that time, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was under enemy blockade, which added many difficulties to the Yan'an factories. The main problems were a lack of raw materials, machines, poor factory equipment, little experience, and low technology. However, their tasks were important: to manufacture a large number of munitions and agricultural implements to support the revolutionary war and agricultural production. How to overcome these difficulties? In the factory, it meant increasing labor enthusiasm and strengthening technical learning to improve production and save raw materials. Zhao Zhankui was the most outstanding in these areas. On hot days, he stood beside a furnace with a temperature of about 2,000 degrees Celsius, without asbestos clothing, using cotton clothing instead, and his clothes were often soaked with sweat. While working, he also taught apprentices. He told the apprentices when to add charcoal, when to add iron, the size of the wind force, how to avoid wasting materials, and how to save labor. Zhao Zhankui was an old sand-turning worker. He taught the young apprentices the experience he had accumulated over the years, bit by bit, so that their skills continued to improve.
    When the apprentices were not yet able to work independently, he was unwilling to hand over the work to them immediately. But once, he fell ill and had a high fever, so only the apprentices could take over. The apprentice had an accident while watching the furnace: a lump was formed in the furnace. When he heard about it, he struggled to get up. Unable to walk, he went to watch the furnace with a cane for a day, so that the factory did not suffer any losses. In 1943, he was once scalded on the foot by molten iron. The workers sent him to the hospital, and many comrades came to comfort him and give him many things. Deng Fa, the leader of the Chinese workers' movement, personally went to the hospital to see him at that time. Zhao Zhankui was not concerned about himself, but about the work in the factory and the soldiers at the front. Therefore, he gave all the things that the comrades had given him to the front-line troops.
    Usually, in production, he would pick up even a small piece of scrap iron on the ground, because he knew how difficult it was to obtain iron. He cherished the machines more than his own life. He said, "We are now working for the revolution and also for ourselves." He was working in the factory entirely as a master.
  Leading Everyone Forward Together
    Zhao Zhankui is not only a production expert, but more importantly, he can unite the workers and lead everyone forward together. He has a high degree of class friendship and a spirit of serving the people. Here I record a few things:
    In 1947, when the enemy invaded Yan'an, Zhao Zhankui was responsible for leading dozens of female comrades and their children from the factory to evacuate. They were acting in an organized manner under unified command. One day, they lost contact with their superiors and did not understand the changes in the enemy's situation. He had such a great responsibility, and despite his fatigue, he tried every means to protect everyone's safety. Sometimes they had to walk seventy miles of mountain roads in one night. What to do when the children could not walk and there were no livestock? Zhao Zhankui took turns carrying the children. When they arrived at the campsite, everyone else rested, but he had to plan the cooking and ask if this person had drunk water and see if that person had washed their feet. Zhao Zhankui was already over fifty years old at this time.
    When the factory moved to Hedong (the former Jin-Sui Liberated Area), the environment was better, so he organized a workers' primary school, which relieved the mothers of a lot of trouble and gave the children the opportunity to receive education. He said, "I didn't go to school when I was young and suffered a lot, and I can't let the children suffer this again." It was very difficult to build a school in the mountains at that time. First, there had to be money. This was solved by the government and the trade union each contributing a part. The teachers were people with higher education in the factory who also took on this role. A room, a bench, and many specific problems took a lot of thought, but the school was eventually established. He was very concerned about this school. When Comrade Zhao Zhankui returned from Harbin in 1948 after attending the Sixth Labor Congress, he bought stationery and game equipment for the school from afar.
    During the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Self-Defense, Zhao Zhankui united the vast number of workers with such a spirit to complete the great task of supporting the revolutionary war.
  A Good Leader After Participating in Government
    Now, Zhao Zhankui is participating in government work as a representative of the workers, serving as Deputy Minister of the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, and managing major national affairs. This is a heavy responsibility. He works all day during the day, and at night he tosses and turns in bed thinking about work. One of the cadres under his leadership said, "Minister Zhao not only tells you how to work, but also calculates the numbers for everything very clearly for you." Many new cadres were reluctant to go when they were first assigned to the Labor Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, but after they went, they were reluctant to leave. Wang Xiuzheng once said, "Going to the Labor Department is like going to your own home, not like going to a new agency." Zhao Zhankui patiently teaches new cadres, just like he taught apprentices in the factory. When something goes wrong at work, he first examines himself. He often says, "This is because the arrowhead is not straight, so the arrow shaft is crooked."
    He has close contact with the workers. In February of this year, some unemployed workers in Xi'an went to "Old Zhao" to find a solution. Comrade Zhao Zhankui paid close attention to this issue. According to his understanding, although the unemployment problem in the Northwest is not serious compared to other places, there are more than 20,000 registered unemployed. In addition to a comprehensive plan to solve the problem, he first helped the unemployed workers in Xi'an establish a shoe factory to make shoes for the army, which were ordered by the army. He negotiated with the troops to borrow money from them first. In this way, the factory now earns an average of seven catties of flour per person per day, and the lives of several family members are guaranteed. The factory now has 700 workers and has completed 70,000 pairs of shoes in the half year since its establishment.
    He has recently focused on two more tasks: one is to inspect factory safety and hygiene, and the other is labor-management consultation meetings in private enterprises. His working method is: first, explain things clearly to everyone. For example, for factory hygiene, universally print and explain the central government's factory hygiene regulations, and then inspect. Second, solve problems as soon as they are discovered during the inspection if they can be solved. Third, he said, "The good should be praised, and the bad should be criticized."
    He is now leading the solution of these problems, so that the 500,000 workers in the Northwest can more smoothly build the Northwest.
  Talking About Building the Northwest
    Talking about the prospects for the construction of the Northwest, Zhao Zhankui is full of confidence. He pointed out: the Northwest has the vast pastures of Xinjiang and Qinghai, which can be used for the development of leather and woolen textile industries. The oil in Gansu and Shaanxi is an important fuel for industrial construction. Guanzhong produces cotton, which can develop the textile industry. The Northwest produces grain everywhere, which is also a convenient condition for building the Northwest. The Northwest has broad development prospects. He said, "Now the most important problem is transportation. Without transportation lines, machines cannot be transported in, and products cannot be transported out, so there is no way. Yumen's oil has the power to increase production by another double, but because more production cannot be transported out, it has to stop at the current output." He said, "We have ways to overcome these difficulties. Now tens of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers are rushing to repair the Tianbao and Tianlan Roads. This is a great project. The army is paving the way for the construction of the Northwest, and we workers must hurry up and prepare for various engineering constructions."
    The construction of the Northwest is a long-term and arduous struggle. As long as the transportation problem is solved, development will be fast. (Attached picture)

　　访问老英雄赵占魁
    艾方
    全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议前夕，记者在西安访问了出席会议的代表老英雄赵占魁同志。事先，在电话中和他约定时间，他说：“明天十二点吧！因为要先开个会，让大家对我再提些意见，然后谈，会更好些。”话是那么恳切而富责任感！
    第二天，如期在他的办公室里见到了他。是个慈祥的老人。谈话间充分流露出他有着坚强的意志。他今年已经五十四岁，头发斑白，前额和眼角上的几道深深的，有力的皱纹，刻画出了他几十年来的辛劳。
  赵占魁走过的路
    他讲起了他劳动的一生。他家在山西定襄县的农村里。家庭是贫农。在地主的高压和剥削下不能维持生活，他十七岁上离开了家，去当一个铁匠的学徒。以后流落太原，一直到一九三八年为止，他辗转在铜元厂、太原兵工厂、同蒲铁路做工。日寇占领太原后，他和同蒲路的其他工人一道到了延安。一九三八年五月入安吴青训班，后转入延安工人学校。一九三九年他自动请求，到了延安农具工厂做工。这是个制造农具和军火的工厂，他在这里贡献很大。由于他能克服一切困难完成任务，并善于带领大家，因此，大家都向他学习，在党中央的直接领导下，一九四三年在延安掀起了有名的赵占魁运动。这是个群众性的生产运动。一九四八年他参加了全国第六次劳动大会。一九四九年到一九五○年，先后被选为人民政协代表，西北总工会常务委员，中央人民政府又任命他做西北军政委员会劳动部副部长。
  生产中的英雄事迹
    他从工人学校，到了农具工厂。在这里第一次考验了他忘我的工作精神，和惊人的劳动热情。当时的陕甘宁边区是在敌人的封锁下，因此给延安的工厂增加了很多困难。主要是缺乏原料、机器，工厂设备差，经验少，技术低。但是，他们的任务却是重大的：要制造大批的军火和农具，来支援革命战争，和农业生产。怎样来克服这些困难呢？在工厂里，就是提高劳动热情，加强学习技术，以提高生产，节约原料。赵占魁就是在这几方面表现最出色的一个。炎热天，他站在两千度左右高温的熔炉旁，没有石棉衣，以棉衣来代替，衣服经常被汗水湿透着。他这样，一面工作，一面教徒弟。他告诉学徒什么时候加炭，什么时候加铁，风力大小，怎样才能不浪费东西，又节省人力。赵占魁是个老翻沙工人。他把他长年累月积下的经验，一点一滴地传授年青的学徒，使他们的技术不断地提高。
    当学徒还不能独立进行工作的时候，他是不肯把工作一下交给学徒的。但有一次，他生了病，周身发高烧，只能由徒弟来担任。徒弟看炉发生了事故：炉里炼成了疙瘩。他听说后，挣扎着起来。不能走路，拄着棍子去看了一天炉，使工厂没有受到损失。一九四三年，有一次他被铁水烫伤了脚。工人们把他送到医院里，很多同志去慰问他，给他送了很多东西。中国职工运动领导者邓发同志，当时曾亲自去医院看他。赵占魁所关心的不是他自己，而是工厂里的工作，和前方的战士们。因此他把同志们送给他的东西，全部转交给前方部队了。
    平时在生产中，地上有一点碎铁，他都拾起来，他知道铁的来路是多么困难。他爱护机器超过爱护自己的生命。他说：“我们现在是为革命做工，也是为自己做工。”他完全是以主人翁的地位在工厂里进行工作的。
  率领大家一同前进
    赵占魁不仅是生产能手，更重要的是，他能团结工人，率领大家一同前进。他有高度的阶级友爱，为人民服务的精神。这里我记下这样几件事：
    一九四七年敌人侵犯延安的时候，赵占魁负责率领着工厂的几十个女同志和她们的孩子撤退。他们是在统一指挥下有组织行动的。一天和上级失掉了联系，又不了解敌情变化，负的责任又这样大，他不顾疲劳，想尽各种办法保护大家的安全。有时一夜要走七十里地的山路，孩子走不动，又没有牲口，怎么办呢？赵占魁就轮流着抱着孩子走。到达宿营地，别人都休息了，他要筹划做饭的事，问问这个喝了水没有，看看那个洗了脚没有。赵占魁这时已经是五十岁以上的人了。
    当工厂搬到河东（过去晋绥解放区）的时候，环境比较好了，他就组织起了一个工人小学，给母亲们解除了很多麻烦，又使小孩有受教育的机会。他说：“我小时没有上学，吃了苦，不能再让孩子们吃这个苦。”当时在山地里建立个学校是很困难的。第一、要有钱。这是由政府和工会各出一部分来解决了。教员，是由工厂里文化程度较高的人来兼任。一间房子，一条凳子，很多具体问题都是很费心思的，但学校终究是办起来了。他很关心这个学校，当一九四八年赵占魁同志去哈尔滨参加六次劳大回来的时候，从远地给学校买回了文具，及游戏用具等。
    在抗日战争和自卫战争中，赵占魁就是以这样的精神团结广大工人一道来完成支援革命战争的伟大任务的。
  参政后是个好的领导者
    现在，赵占魁是以工人代表的身份参加政府工作，担任西北军政委员会劳动部副部长的职务，管理国家的大事情。这是个繁重的职务。白天他工作了一天，晚上躺到床上也翻来覆去地考虑工作。一个在他领导下的干部说：“赵部长不仅告诉你工作办法，就是把一件事情的数字都给你计算的很清楚。”许多新干部，开始被派去西北军政委员会劳动部的时候不愿去，但去了后就又不愿离开了。王秀正曾这样说：“到了劳动部就像到了自己的家一样，不像到了一个新机关。”赵占魁耐心地教导新干部，就像在工厂的时候教导学徒一样。当工作中出了岔子，他首先检讨自己。他常说：“这是箭头不正扭了箭杆。”
    他和工人有密切联系。今年二月，西安一些失业工人去找“老赵”想办法。赵占魁同志很注意这个问题。据他了解，西北的失业问题，比较起来虽不算严重，但登记的失业者有两万多。除了统盘计划解决外，他先帮助西安的失业工人建立了一个鞋厂，给军队做鞋子，由军队订购。他交涉请部队上先借钱给他们。这样，这个工厂现在平均每人每日能得七斤面的工资，一家几口人的生活就有了保障。现在该厂已有七百名工人，自成立到现在半年来完成了七万双鞋。
    他最近又抓紧了两个工作：一是检查工厂安全卫生，一是私营企业中的劳资协商会议。他的工作方法是：第一，先把事情给大家讲清楚。如工厂卫生，把中央规定的工厂卫生条例普遍印发、解释，然后检查。第二，检查中发现了问题，能够解决的随时解决。第三，他说：“好的要表扬，坏的要批评。”
    他现在领导解决这些问题，使西北五十万工人更顺利地建设西北。
  畅谈建设西北
    谈到西北建设的远景，赵占魁满怀信心。他指出：西北有新疆、青海的广大牧场，可供制革、毛纺业的发展。甘肃、陕西的石油是工业建设上的重要燃料。关中出棉花，可以发展纺织业。西北到处产粮食，这也是建设西北的便利条件。西北有广宽的发展前途。他说：“现在最重要的问题，就是交通问题。没有交通线，机器运不进，产品运不出，就没有办法。玉门的石油，本来有力量再提高生产一倍，因为产多了运不出，就只好停在现在的产量上。”他说：“这样一些困难，我们是有办法克服的。现在有几万人民军队赶修天宝、天兰路。这是个伟大的工程。军队给建设西北开道，我们工人要赶紧准备各种工程建设。”
    西北的建设是个长期坚苦的斗争。只要交通问题解决了，发展也是快的。（附图片）
