　　With Gradual Improvement in Industrial and Commercial Production and Sales
    Shanghai's Private Banks' Deposits Gradually Increase
    In the Future, Banks Will Face Legitimate Industry and Commerce
    [Report from our Shanghai Bureau] With the adjustment of public-private relations and the gradual improvement of industrial and commercial production and sales, deposits in Shanghai's silver and money industry have increased. As of the end of July, there were still 66 private banks and 10 foreign banks in Shanghai. Since the central government began adjusting industry and commerce and public-private relations in May, the concentrated closure phenomenon of Shanghai's private banks since March ceased in June. For example, 35 closed in March, 24 in April, and 20 in May; while in June, only two voluntarily closed, and only one voluntarily closed in July. At the same time, private banks themselves are also actively carrying out transformation, organizing four vertical business banking groups, participating in public-private joint lending offices, organizing labor-management consultation meetings, reasonably improving business methods, and holding red flag competitions to mobilize employees to face production and jointly strive for business improvement. At present, except for a small number, most banks have been able to break even and be self-sufficient, and some have even had surpluses. The proportion of private bank deposits in the total private deposits in Shanghai has gradually increased, which also shows that the business of private banks has broad development prospects under the premise of developing production and prospering the economy. The deposit ratios for each month are as follows: 32.6 percent in March, 36.1 percent in April, 37.9 percent in May, 41 percent in June, and 41.4 percent in July. In particular, after the National Financial Industry Joint Conference was held in Beijing on August 1st, private banks became more aware of their responsibilities, and also reviewed that private banks had not provided good support and assistance to legitimate industry and commerce in the past. Therefore, how to serve the development of industry and commerce in the future has become the center of discussion and work for the returned Shanghai silver and money industry representatives.

　　工商业产销情况逐步好转下
    沪私营行庄存款渐增   
    今后各行庄将面向正当工商业
    【本报上海讯】随着公私关系的调整与工商业产销情况的逐步好转，沪银钱业存款增加。截至七月份止，沪市尚有私营行庄六十六家，洋商银行十家。自五月份中央开始调整工商业和公私关系后，沪私营行庄自三月份以来的集中性倒闭现象，到六月份即告中止。如三月份停业三十五家，四月份停业二十四家，五月份停业二十家；而在六月份中，仅自动停业两家，七月份自动停业的只有一家。同时，私营行庄本身也积极进行改造，组织了四个纵营银团，参加公营私营联合放款处，组织劳资协商会议，合理改善经营方式，并举办红旗竞赛，发动职工面向生产，共同争取业务好转。目前，除一小部分外，大部行庄已能保本自给，且有的已有盈余。私营行庄存款在上海全市私营存款总数中的比例逐渐增加，也表示了私营行庄的业务，在发展生产、繁荣经济的前提下，是有它广阔的发展前途的。各月份存款比例如下：三月份百分之三十二点六，四月份百分之三十六点一，五月份百分之三十七点九，六月份百分之四十一，七月份百分之四十一点四。尤其是八月一日在京召开全国金融业联席会议后，私营行庄更明了了自己的责任，又检讨了私营行庄过去对于正当工商业并没有很好的扶植和帮助，因而今后如何为工商业的发展服务，已为回沪银钱业代表们讨论和工作的中心。
