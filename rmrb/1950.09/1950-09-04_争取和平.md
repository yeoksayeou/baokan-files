Strive for Peace
Han Xueye, Chairman of the Korean Democratic People's Republic Committee for the Defense of World Peace

There is such a passionate word, as if it had grown wings, flying from this country to that, from this home to that, repeated countless times from this person's mouth to that person's, in hundreds of languages and dialects, like a song, touching and igniting hearts.

Peace! This stirring word once shimmered on the proud Soviet flag erected on the roof of the smoking Reichstag in Berlin, and now it spreads across the earth with renewed strength.

"Peace!" said the dockworkers of Marseille and Antwerp, and the heavy American tanks and boxes filled with shells rolled into the sea.

"Peace!" repeated the railway workers of France, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands, and in Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, and Greece, soldiers holding weapons and mortars stood there woodenly...

"Peace!" shouted the simple people of the world, and the roar of this brief word is a stern warning to all who attempt to force working people to slaughter each other, who attempt to stain the peaceful rivers that irrigate the fields with the blood of war.

The fifth spring has come to Korea. Why the fifth spring? Because in our country, we count the springs from the memorable summer: that is, when the Soviet tanks climbed the steep Changbai Mountains, the Soviet elder brothers wiped out our enemies of many years, and brought us freedom and what they had won in the bloody battle to liberate Korean land.

When we speak of it now—of the spring in Korea—we do not forever remember the rose-colored April mornings. We cherish that spring filled with human emotion and bright hopes. This spring was brought to Korea under the scorching sun of the South by Soviet sergeants wearing dusty uniforms that still carried the smell of war, on that day in August 1945.

Our dear guests did not stay long in our country. They stayed exactly long enough to teach us those things we would not have otherwise learned, things forbidden for many years.

We learned to build factories and smelters, mines, clubs, and hospitals. We learned how to obtain bountiful harvests, we taught our children those wonderful ancient songs that had been buried, and began to create new songs, praising the glorious destiny of the people as old as the earth. For the first time, we felt ourselves to be masters of the country, creators of our own happiness.

Our elder brothers told us when they left:

"Live happily in your beautiful land! Do not stint on labor, so that the mountains that have been stripped bare by foreign and enemy hands are covered with lush forests, so that two ears of wheat grow where one once grew, so that your children leap in the most beautiful gardens, where for decades only the intimidating shouts of Japanese guards could be heard, so that cultural palaces and universities, schools and hospitals, blast furnaces and well-lit new houses spring up like bamboo shoots..."

Five springs have transformed the face of our country.

Look at our fields! Strange, ingenious machines—tractors—walk confidently along the fields. Powerful plows dig deep into the land that for centuries has only been dug with spades, loosening the soil like poplar fluff. Farmers, wearing their best clothes, approach the machines with an unspeakable joy, machines they are seeing for the first time in their lives.

Look at our factories! There are many brand-new, labor-saving machines. Before, Koreans—whom the Japanese called "inferior Eastern races"—were only allowed to make jars for holding rice. But now, so many brand-new machines have appeared—coal-cutting machines in the mines that can quickly cut through coal seams, electric motors that turn powerful machine tools, small motorboats that go out to sea, and many other machines that we have created with our own hands. Yesterday's coolies have become the masters of the factories today, and they have mastered great, varied labor skills, working selflessly.

The unquenchable flame burns everywhere in the north of the republic. This flame is in the furnaces and Martin furnaces, in the rumbling of new factories, in the rustling of modern rice mills, and in the hearts of the people. The people are peacefully building our country, laying one stone upon another, laying an unshakable foundation for a bright, democratic future.

But what is this? Do you hear gunfire? Do you see cannons firing?

The war stopped five springs ago. But the mad jackals of the South, brought to the stage by masters across the ocean, have turned the 38th parallel into a front line. That is why they are shooting at peaceful villages every day, causing the thick smoke ignited by the Syngman Rhee gang to fly over the peasants' huts, and that is why the "Children's Homes" are filled with orphans who have lost their parents!

Curse those who have stained the peaceful, fragrant land with the blood of brothers! Let this multifaceted monster—Wall Street—let him shake the world's dollars and hydrogen bombs. They cannot buy off the working people with money, nor can they intimidate them with bombs!

Ask the tractor driver of Wonsan: does he want to drive a tank? Does he want to trample on that newly cultivated, fertile field?

Ask the fisherman of Pounam-town—his fishing net is full of fresh fish that now belong only to him—is he willing to float black sea mines in the water instead of herring and mackerel shoals?

Ask any loving mother in any city or village, north and south: is she willing to let her son be a victim of war?

Ask the millions of honest Koreans, simple people like us—are they willing to take off their light, peaceful clothes and put on hard military overcoats? Are they willing to put aside plows, hammers, fishing nets, locksmith's tools, books, pens, brushes, violins, and pick up guns and carry military supply bags?

Ask all the people—do they need war? They will all shout:

"No war!"

That is why the fifth spring in Korea—this is the spring of the struggle for peace. That is why 13,157 committees for the struggle for peace have been established in provinces and counties, in cities and villages; at the same time, the number of people signing to ban the use of atomic weapons and to demand world peace and security is constantly growing.

More than five million North Koreans have declared before all of humanity that they do not want war. These people are of different occupations, views, and beliefs, and they are now united in a noble human passion.

The textile worker Li Jinman (transliteration) of Yongheung County shouted when she signed the Stockholm Appeal:

"Let the warmongers understand:—we, the simple people,—are the majority! If we—all the simple people in the world—order the gun muzzles aimed at us to turn in another direction,—how can you expect that those bullets will not directly hit the display windows of Wall Street?!..."

Old farmer Li Yinjie (transliteration) of South Hamgyong Province never liked to talk much. But when his fellow villagers convened a meeting to talk about peace, he grabbed a handful of rice and said:

"Life has become as white as this rice. I don't want this rice to be burned to ashes by the flames of war. I just learned to write, and the name I signed today on this declaration that hundreds of millions of people around the world have already signed—this is the first time I have ever signed my name in my life!"

The monk of Seongbok Temple (transliteration) said:

"In our temple, there are more than five hundred Buddha statues. If they were not made of marble and bronze, they would definitely sign the peace declaration. We, these honest monks, are all signing today. None of us are communists. But we see and feel: at this time, if you stand silently by—that means you support war. So now everyone should fight for peace, as long as a living heart is still beating in this person's chest, and not covered with a cold stone..."

The American masters are trying to hide from our brothers in the South that kind of thing that is now stirring the globe. Not a word was mentioned in the treacherous Syngman Rhee newspapers and radio stations about the Stockholm Congress in support of peace. But now the truth of mankind is without obstacles. The truth will penetrate people's hearts through batons.

The patriotic comrades of the underground newspaper "The Laborer" of the South Korean Labor Party printed hundreds of thousands of copies of the Stockholm Peace Declaration, and the peace declaration penetrated desolate mountain villages, mines, factories, and guerrilla bases hidden in inaccessible valleys.

"No war!" we shout sternly to the warmongers.

"No war!" comes the cry from our brothers on the other side of the 38th parallel, brothers who cannot openly sign alongside us today, but who wholeheartedly join us, and hundreds of millions of people around the world, in striving for peace and opposing war.

"Strive for world peace!" The battle cry is shaking the earth. It flies around the peaks of the Tianshan and Pamir Mountains, over the raging tides of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, over the vineyards of St. Bernie and the skyscrapers of New York, in the orange groves of Italy and the rice fields of Japan, in the rocky fjords of Norway and the fertile plains of Poland. Batch after batch, new and new millions of honest, simple people stand up to meet this call.

专栏：

　　争取和平
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席韩雪野
    有这么一个热情的字眼，仿佛生上了翅膀似的，从这国飞到那国，从这家飞到那家，从这个人的嘴上飞到那个人的嘴上，用数百种语言和方言屡次重复着，像歌声一样，触动着和燃烧着心灵。
    和平！这个激动的字眼曾经闪烁在那一面竖在冒着烟的柏林国会屋顶上的骄傲的苏维埃旗帜上面，现在带着新的力量传播在大地上了。
    “和平！”马赛和安特卫普的码头工人说了这句话，于是笨重的美国坦克和装满炮弹的箱子滚到海里去了。
    “和平！”法国、比利时、意大利和荷兰的铁道工人反复说，于是，在越南、缅甸、马来亚和希腊，手持武器与迫击炮的士兵们木然呆立在那里……
    “和平！”全世界纯朴的人们高呼着，这简短的字眼的吼声，对于凡是企图强迫劳动人民互相残杀的、企图用战争的血把灌溉田地的和平河流染红的人们来说，是一个严厉的警告。
    第五个春天来到了朝鲜。为什么是第五个春天呢？因为在我国，计算春天是从值得纪念的那个夏天开始的：那就是当苏联坦克爬上了险峻的长白山岭，苏联老大哥们消灭了我们多年的敌人，把自由和他们在解放朝鲜土地的血战中所赢得的东西带给我们的时候。
    当我们现在——在朝鲜的春天——谈起的时候，我们不是永远记着玫瑰色的四月早晨。我们怀念着那充溢人类情感和光辉期望的春天。这个春天是在南方烈日照射下，苏联军士们穿着积有灰尘的，残留着战争气味的军服，在一九四五年八月那天带到朝鲜的。
    我们亲爱的客人们在我国逗留并不久。他们为了在停留的时间，教给我们本来不会的、多年来被禁止学习的那些东西，他们就停留得恰正这么久。
    我们学会了建筑工厂和熔矿炉、矿井、俱乐部和医院。我们学会了怎样获得丰饶的收获，我们把那些曾被埋没的绝妙的古代歌曲教给我们的孩子，并开始创作一些新的歌曲，讴歌像大地一般古老的人民的光辉命运。我们首次感到自己是国家的主人，是自己的幸福的创造者。
    我们的老大哥们在离别的时候告诉我们说：
    “在你们美好的土地上幸福地生活吧！不要吝惜劳动吧，为了使那些被外国人和敌人的手所掠光的山上铺满了繁茂的森林，为了使一个麦穗的地方长出两个麦穗来，为了使你们的孩子跳跃在最美丽的花园里，数十年来这儿是只能听到日本卫兵的威吓的叱咤的，为了使文化宫和大学，学校和医院，熔铁炉和光线充足的新住宅像春笋似的兴建起来……”
    五个春天已使我国的面貌改观了。
    看看我们的田野吧！奇怪的，精巧的机器——拖拉机沿着田野自信地走着。强有力的犁深深地掘入数世纪来仅知用铁锹来掘的土地里，使土地松软得像杨树的毛茸。农民穿着自己最好的衣服，心里充满一种说不出的高兴走近机器去，这些机器在他们的生活中还是第一次看见呢。
    看一下我们的工厂吧！那里有许多簇新的、减轻人力的机器。从前对于朝鲜人——日本人曾叫我们“劣等的东方种族”，——是只准烧制装米的罐子的。可是现在，已经出现了这么多崭新的机器—在矿坑中能够迅速切断煤层的挖煤机、转动强有力的机床的电动机、下海的小汽艇及其他许多我们亲手造成的机器。昨天的苦力们到今天成为工厂的主人，他们掌握了伟大的、各种各样的劳动技术，在忘我地劳动着。
    不能扑灭的火焰在共和国北部到处燃烧着。这火焰是在熔炉和马丁炉中，在新工厂的辘辘声中，在近代式米舂的沙沙声中，在人们的心中。人民和平地建设着我们的国家，放下一块石头又一块石头，给光明的民主的未来，奠定不可动摇的基础。
    但是，这是什么？你听见枪声了吗？你看见大炮在发射吗？
    五个春天以前，战争停止了。但是，海洋彼岸的主人牵上台来的南方疯狂的豺狼却把三八线变成了前线。这就是为什么他们每天都在射击和平的村庄，弄得李承晚匪帮所燃起的浓浓的烟团在农民的小屋上飞扬起来，这就是，为什么“儿童之家”充满了失去父母的孤儿！
    谁用兄弟们的流着的血染污了和平的、馥郁的土地，就诅咒谁吧！让这个多面的怪兽——华尔街，让他摇晃着世界的美元和氢弹吧。他们用金钱收买不了劳动人民，他们用炸弹也恫吓不了他们！
    请问元山的拖拉机手：他想驾驶坦克吗？他想践踏那刚被开垦好的，肥沃的田野吗？
    请问一下浦南镇的渔夫——他的鱼网里充满了新鲜的、现在仅属于他自己的鱼——他愿意把黑色的水雷飘在水下来代替鲱鱼和鲭鱼群吗？
    请问一下北部和南部的任何城市乡村的慈母：她愿意让她的儿子作战争的牺牲者吗？
    请问一下数百万正直的朝鲜人，像我们一样的纯朴的人，——他们愿意脱下轻便的和平的衣服换上坚硬的军服大氅吗？他们愿意把犁、锤子、鱼网、锁匠的工具、书、笔、画笔、提琴放在一边，而拿起枪来，背起军用给养袋来吗？
    请问一下所有的人们，——他们需要战争吗？他们全都会高呼：
    “不要战争！”
    这就是为什么在朝鲜的第五个春天——这是争取和平斗争的春天。这就是为什么在省和县，在城市和乡村已有一万三千一百五十七个争取和平斗争的委员会建立起来；同时签名要求禁止使用原子武器和要求世界和平与安全的人们的数目总是在增长着。
    五百万以上的北朝鲜人民已在全世界人类的前面宣称：他们不愿意战争。这些人是各有不同的职业，观点和信仰的，他们现在团结在高贵的人类的激情中。
    永兴县的纺织工人李金曼（译音）在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名时高呼说：
    “让战争贩子们明白：——我们，纯朴的人们，——是多数的！如果我们——世界上全体纯朴的人们——命令那瞄向我们的枪口转向另一个方向，——你怎么能够预料，那些子弹不会直接打中华尔街的橱窗玻璃的呢？！……”
    咸镜南道的老农民李印捷（译音）任何时候都不爱说话。但是当他的本乡居民召集大会谈到和平时，他却抓起了一把米说：
    “生活变得像这些米一样的白净了。我不愿意这些米被战火烧成灰。我刚刚学会了写字，我今天在这个全世界亿万人已经签了名的宣言上所签的名字，——这是我有生以来第一次的签名呢！”
    圣福寺（译音）的和尚说道：
    “在我们寺院里，有五百多个佛像。如果不是大理石和青铜作成的，他们一定会在和平宣言上签名。我们，这些诚实的和尚，今天都签名了。我们都不是共产党员。但是我们看见而且感觉到：现在这个时候，如果沉默地站在一边——就是说拥护战争。所以现在谁都应当为和平而斗争，只要这个人的胸膛中还跳着一颗活的心，而不是盖着一块冰冷的石头的话……”
    美国主子们企图对我们南方的兄弟们，瞒住了那一种现在引得全球激动的事情。卖国的李承晚的报纸和电台没有一句话提到关于拥护和平的斯德哥尔摩大会。但是现在人类的真理是没有障碍的。真理会通过警棍渗入人们的心中。
    南朝鲜劳动党的地下报纸《劳力者》的爱国同志们，把斯德哥尔摩和平宣言印刷了数十万份，和平宣言深入了荒凉的山村、矿坑、工厂、和掩藏在不能通过的山谷中的游击队基地。
    “不要战争！”我们向战争贩子严厉地高呼。
    “不要战争！”从三八线彼方送来了我们兄弟们的疾呼，这些兄弟们在今天不能公开地和我们并肩签名，但是他们却全心全意地和我们，和全世界数百万人共同争取和平，反对战争。
    “争取世界和平！”战斗的呼声在大地上震荡着。它飞绕在天山和帕米尔山峰，在大西洋和太平洋的怒潮上，圣伯尼的葡萄园和纽约的摩天楼上，在意大利的橘子林和日本的稻田中，在挪威的岩石重叠的峡江和波兰肥沃的平原上。一批批新而又新的数百万正直的、纯朴的人们迎着这个呼声站立起来了。
