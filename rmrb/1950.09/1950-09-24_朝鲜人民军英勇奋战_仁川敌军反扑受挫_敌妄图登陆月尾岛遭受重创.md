A battalion of the People's Army coastal defense force stationed on Wolmi Island conducted a defensive battle to prevent the enemy, which had more than ten times its strength, from landing. In this battle, the People's Army units displayed unparalleled heroism and an indomitable spirit of dedication and patriotism to the motherland and the people, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

Starting on September 15th, the American invaders landed in Incheon under the cover of more than 300 warships (including battleships and aircraft carriers) and more than 500 aircraft, and launched an offensive towards Seoul, Yeongdeungpo, Gimpo, and Suwon. The enemy attacking towards Suwon was blocked by our army's brave counterattack and suffered great losses. The enemy attacking towards Yeongdeungpo and Gimpo was killed and wounded more than 2,000 people in several days of fighting, lost many tanks and various artillery pieces, and encountered strong resistance.

On September 22nd, the People's Army units defending the Seoul and Incheon areas, supported by the patriotism and dedication of the citizens of Seoul and the residents of the two cities, are preventing the attack of the enemy, which is superior in number, and are engaged in fierce battles to defend every inch of the battlefield.
