　　Hebei Jin County Labor Hero Xu Laomo Practices Intensive Farming
    Cotton Yield Reaches 600 Jin Per Mu
    [Our Newspaper] Jin County Committee Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China, Hebei Province, Jiao Yufeng reports: Xu Laomo, a famous labor hero in Beipeng Village, Jin County, practices intensive farming, and this year the cotton yield per mu is expected to reach a maximum of 600 jin (the general yield is about 100 jin). Xu Laomo originally had experience in growing cotton. This spring, in response to the government's call to grow cotton, he planted S-character 2B cotton on twelve mu of his twenty mu of land. After Lao Mo's meticulous cultivation and intensive farming, the cotton seedlings are strong. When inspected in early September, there were about 2,600 cotton plants per mu, and each plant bore an average of 19 peaches. If the peaches on the top tips also bloom, calculated at 80 peaches per jin of picked cotton, each mu can pick 600 jin. (Editor's note: According to the data from the Industrial Raw Materials Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government: In 1941, Zhao Pengcheng, a cotton farmer in Chengli West Street, Ding County, Hebei, picked 508 jin of good cotton per mu. If Xu Laomo's cotton yield this year can reach 600 jin, it will exceed Zhao Pengcheng's yield.)
    Xu Laomo's cotton planting process is as follows: The cotton field was deeply ploughed twice and harrowed three times before sowing this year, and five large carts of manure (carts pulled by two animals) were applied per mu; S-character 2B cotton seeds were planted, which were exchanged from the farm last year, and planted in large ridges. The cotton seedlings were very fertile and strong when they emerged from the soil. When they grew to three inches high, they were thinned once, and when they were more than five inches high, the seedlings were fixed. The plant spacing is two and a half feet, staggered in rows. Therefore, the cotton seedlings absorb sufficient sunlight and nutrients, and grow well. When cotton aphids occurred in June, Lao Mo used his experience in controlling aphids last year and led his family to treat them twice in one go, and all the aphids were eliminated. When stripping the lower leaves, Lao Mo also used fertilizer powder to apply topdressing to the weak plants. After watering once, the seedlings were hoed six times in a row; when hoeing for the last time, the soil was piled up at the bottom of the cotton plants to protect the stability of the cotton plants. When the cotton seedlings were taller than the knees, pruning and branching were carried out. After the completion of various farming management procedures, the cotton plants generally bloomed and bore peaches, and it is expected to harvest an unprecedented yield of 600 jin of seed cotton.
    Xu Laomo is fifty-five years old this year, a member of the Communist Party of China, and currently serves as the Organization Committee Member of the Beipeng Village Branch of the Communist Party of China. He was poor since childhood and engaged in farming. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the Party, he actively engaged in production, accepted scientific principles, and humbly studied and improved production techniques, so that cotton production increased year by year; especially after the land reform, he worked harder in production, and his life became more and more prosperous. This year, Beipeng Village planted a total of 1,400 mu of cotton, accounting for more than 51% of the village's cultivated land area. Under the leadership and exemplary influence of Xu Laomo, with careful processing and overcoming cotton aphids, cotton generally grows well. Many people are combining cotton harvesting with seed selection, and are planning to plant more cotton and select and retain cotton fields next year.

### 河北晋县劳动英雄许老墨精耕细作  棉花每亩产量可达六百斤

　　河北晋县劳动英雄许老墨精耕细作
    棉花每亩产量可达六百斤
    【本报讯】中共河北省晋县县委宣传部焦玉峰报道：晋县北彭家庄著名劳动英雄许老墨精耕细作，今年每亩棉花产量预计最高可达六百斤（一般产量为一百斤左右）。许老墨原是有种棉经验的，今年春天，响应政府种棉号召，在二十亩土地中，种了十二亩斯字二Ｂ棉，经过老墨的悉心培育，精耕细作，棉苗茁壮，九月初检查时，每亩棉花约有二千六百棵，每棵平均结桃十九个，如顶尖上的桃也开了，按八十个桃摘花一斤计算，每亩能摘六百斤。（编者按：据中央人民政府农业部工业原料司的资料记载：一九四一年，河北定县城里西街棉农赵鹏程，每亩曾摘好花五百零八斤。如果许老墨今年的棉花产量能达六百斤，即可超过赵鹏程的产量。）
    许老墨植棉的经过是：今年播种前的棉田曾深耕了两遍，耙了三遍，每亩上粪五大车（两个牲口拉的车）；种的是去年向农场换来的斯字二Ｂ棉籽，并耩成大垅。棉苗出土即很肥壮。长到三寸高时，间了一次苗，五寸多高时定了苗。株距都是二尺半，纵横交错成行。因此棉苗吸收阳光、养分充足，生长良好。六月棉蚜发生时，老墨即以去年治蚜的经验，带动全家人一气治了两遍，蚜虫全部被消灭。捋土叶时，老墨又顺便用肥田粉拣弱棵施了一次追肥。浇一次水后，即连续锄苗六遍；锄最后一遍时，将土壅到棉棵根底下，以保护棉棵稳固。棉苗高过膝时；进行了整枝打杈。各项耕作管理手续完竣后，棉棵即普遍开花结桃，可望收摘籽棉六百斤的空前产量。
    许老墨今年五十五岁，中共党员，现任中共北彭家庄村支部组织委员。自幼贫苦，务农为业。在人民政府和党的领导下，积极生产，并接受科学道理，虚心研究改进生产技术，使棉产量逐年增加；尤其是经过土改后，更加努力生产，生活也更日渐富裕。今年北彭家庄共植棉一千四百亩，占全村耕地面积百分之五十一强。在许老墨的领导与带头影响下，加工细作，战胜棉蚜，棉花一般都生长良好。不少群众都正在结合收棉进行选种，并计划着明年多种棉花，选留棉田。
