　　Statement by the Soviet Writers' Association
    The Soviet Writers' Association has issued the following statement to the United Nations Security Council: Lake Success, New York, United Nations Security Council:
    The people of all countries in the world are deeply concerned for the fate of billions of peaceful people, for the lives of children and the elderly, for the future of millions of young men and women, and for the fate of the culture and civilization of all mankind.
    Due to the instigation of American diplomats and politicians, a bloody war has unfolded in Korea. The result of this war is the daily killing of thousands of peaceful residents, the destruction of Korean cities and villages, and the destruction of the brilliant cultural achievements of the Korean people over many centuries.
    We Soviet writers, who have experienced the bloody battle against German fascism alongside our own people, and witnessed many cities turn into ruins, and countless libraries, museums, and cultural and scientific facilities reduced to ashes, therefore, we can particularly understand the protests and sacred anger of the Korean people and all progressive humanity against the cruel atrocities of the American aggressors.
    We demand that the United Nations Security Council fulfill its true obligations, restore peace in Korea, and enable the Korean people to determine their own destiny without interference from others.
    In addition to the well-known crimes already committed by the American aggressors, we have seen many new and outrageous crimes from the report of the Investigation Committee on the atrocities of the American-Li Syngman clique of the Korean Fatherland Unification Democratic Front.
    What is referred to here is the slaughter of peaceful people working in the fields by the American air force in order to destroy the Korean economy and plunge the Korean people into poverty, as well as the bestial bombing of Korean factories and workshops. Schools, hospitals, and residential areas that have nothing to do with military facilities have also been subjected to barbaric and deliberate bombing. The blood of the people has flowed throughout Korea.
    We cannot help but be angry when writing about these situations!
    The United Nations must no longer use the sky-blue flag of peace to cover up the crimes of the aggressors!
    We call upon and demand that the Security Council listen to the voices of hundreds of millions of people around the world, stop the bloody atrocities in Korea, sanction the aggressors, and restore the credibility of the Security Council and the United Nations, which has already been swept away.
    In this demand, we believe that we are the successors of the world-renowned Russian classical writers Tolstoy and Gorky in the struggle for the victory of the great ideals of true humanitarianism.
    In this demand, we are united with the best writers of all countries in the world; those countries that now have official representatives attending the Security Council, the eternal conscience of their classical writers is with us: for example, Whitman and Dreiser of the United States, Byron and Dickens of England, Zola and France of France, Ibsen of Norway, Tagore of India, and Henri José Rodó, who has guided the thinking of Latin American progressive intellectuals for many years.
    We, in the name of Soviet writers, want to join our voices in the angry tide of protests from people all over the world. We demand:
    1.  Stop the American aggression in Korea as soon as possible.
    2.  Prohibit the bombing of peaceful Korean cities and residents unconditionally and as soon as possible.
    3.  Withdraw all foreign troops from Korea as soon as possible.

### 苏联作家协会声明

　　苏联作家协会声明
    苏联作家协会向联合国安理会发出了如下的声明：纽约成功湖联合国安全理事会：
    全世界各国人民为了亿万和平人民的命运，为了儿童们和老年人的生命，为了千百万男女青年的将来，为了全人类的文化和文明的命运，已经感到极大的忧虑。
    由于美国外交家和政客们的策动，在朝鲜展开了流血的战争。这一战争的结果就是每天杀害了成千的和平居民，毁灭了朝鲜的城市和村庄，摧毁了朝鲜人民许多世纪来的光辉的文化果实。
    我们苏联作家，曾经和本国人民一道经历过反抗德国法西斯的血战，目睹许多城市变成废墟，无数图书馆、博物馆和文化科学设施，化为灰烬，因此朝鲜人民和一切进步人类对于美国侵略者的残忍兽行的抗议，及其神圣的愤怒，我们是特别可以理解到的。
    我们要求联合国安理会履行自己真正的义务，恢复朝鲜的和平，使朝鲜人民有不受他人干扰而决定自己命运的可能。
    除了美国侵略者所已造成的尽人皆知的罪行，我们从朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线美李暴行调查委员会的报告中，又看到了许许多多新的令人发指的罪状。
    这里所指的就是美国空军为了要破坏朝鲜的经济，使朝鲜人民陷于贫困，对在田地里工作的和平人民的残杀，以及对朝鲜工厂、作坊所施的兽性滥炸。与军事设施毫无关系的学校、医院、住宅区也遭到了野蛮的蓄意的轰炸。人民的鲜血流遍了整个朝鲜。
    写到这些情况时，我们是不能不愤怒的！
    联合国绝不能再用和平的天蓝色的旗子来遮掩侵略者的罪行了！
    我们呼吁并要求安理会倾听全世界千百万人民的声音，制止在朝鲜的血腥暴行，制裁侵略者，挽回安理会和联合国已经扫地的威信。
    在我们这一要求中，我们自认为，我们就是举世闻名的俄国古典作家——托尔斯泰和高尔基为争取真正人道主义的伟大理想的胜利斗争的继承者。
    在我们的这一要求中，我们是和全世界一切国家的最优秀的作家们一致的；那些现在有官方代表出席安理会的国家，他们的古典作家们的永生的良心是和我们在一起的：例如美国的惠特曼和德来赛，英国的拜伦和狄更斯，法国的左拉和弗朗司，挪威的易卜生，印度的泰戈尔，多年来引导着拉丁美洲进步知识分子的思想的亨利·霍赛·罗多。
    我们，以苏联作家的名义，要把自己的声音汇合在全世界人民抗议的怒潮中。我们要求：
    一、从速制止美国在朝鲜的侵略行为。
    二、从速无条件地禁止对朝鲜和平城市与居民的轰炸。
    三、从速撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队。
