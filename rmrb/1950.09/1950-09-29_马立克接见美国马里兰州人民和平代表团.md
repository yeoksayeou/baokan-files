　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 28th: TASS reports that the Maryland Peace Committee of the United States, representing the people of the state and the city of Baltimore, sent a letter to the Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik, expressing the will of broad sections of the American people to safeguard peace. This letter, signed by more than a thousand people from all walks of life, was also sent to the US delegation attending the UN General Assembly. The letter asks the US and Soviet governments to frankly and openly answer four questions, believing that affirmative answers would facilitate peace negotiations to avoid a world war. The four questions are: "1. Will your government agree not to be the first to use atomic bombs? 2. Do you support the proposal for universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons under a strict system of control and supervision by all countries within the United Nations? 3. Do you support (or would you agree to) convene a meeting of the top leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union to discuss existing US-Soviet disputes in order to achieve world peace? 4. Do you support the free exchange of opinions and information between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union, with a view to achieving the mutual understanding necessary for lasting peace?"

　　Malik received the delegation of the committee on September 25th and gave affirmative answers to all the above questions on behalf of the Soviet government. The delegation members expressed satisfaction with Malik's answers. In a friendly conversation with the Soviet representative, the delegation members told Malik that strengthening and maintaining peace, banning atomic bombs, peacefully resolving all outstanding issues between the United States and the Soviet Union, and strengthening friendship between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union are the ardent expectations of all the people of Baltimore and Maryland, as well as the fervent hopes of all the American people.

　　The delegation handed Malik an appeal to the US and Soviet governments signed by 1,150 Baltimore citizens and gave Malik a statement from the committee to be released to the press. In this statement, the committee, representing the people of Maryland, hopes that the current UN General Assembly will be able to "lay the foundation for maintaining lasting peace" and reiterates the people's demands for the prohibition of atomic weapons, universal disarmament, peaceful coexistence between the US and the Soviet Union, and the resolution of disputes through negotiation. The statement insists that "the voices of people everywhere who demand peace should be heeded."

　　However, the US government refused to give frank and affirmative answers to these important and specific peace questions raised by the American people. According to a report by the US Information Service on the 26th, a State Department spokesperson, in his remarks, slandered the affirmative answer given by the Soviet representative to the Security Council, Malik, regarding this ardent peace demand raised by the American people, as "trite propaganda."

　　马立克接见美国马里兰州人民和平代表团
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社纽约二十七日消息，美国马里兰州和平委员会代表该州及巴尔的摩城的人民，致函苏联驻安理会代表马立克，表示美国广大阶层保障和平的意志。这封由包括各个阶层的千余人签名的信函，也送给了出席联合国大会的美国代表团。信中请苏美两国政府坦率公开地回答四个问题，认为肯定的答复将便利于进行和平谈判以避免世界大战。四个问题是：“一、贵国政府将答应不首先使用原子弹么？二、你们支持各国在联合国的严格管制和监督制度之下，普遍裁军和禁用原子武器的建议么？三、你们支持（或是否同意）召集美国和苏联的最高领袖开会讨论美苏现有争端，以达到全世界的和平这一建议么？四、你们支持美苏两国人民自由交换意见和消息，以期达到持久和平所必需的互相了解么？”
    马立克于九月二十五日接见了这个委员会的代表团，代表苏联政府对上述问题都作了肯定的回答。代表团团员对马立克的回答表示满意。代表团团员在和苏联代表的友好会谈中，告诉马立克，加强并保持和平、禁用原子弹、和平解决美苏间一切未决问题及加强美国与苏联人民间的友谊，是巴尔的摩和马里兰州全体人民的热切期望，也是美国全体人民的热烈期望。
    代表团交给马立克一个由一千一百五十个巴尔的摩公民签名的致苏美两国政府的呼吁书，并以委员会的声明一件交给马立克，供给向报界发表。在这一声明中，委员会代表马里兰州的人民希望本届联大能够“奠定维持持久和平的基础”，并重申人民对禁止原子武器，普遍裁减军备，苏美两国和平相处和以谈判方法解决争端的要求。声明坚持“各地要求和平的人民的呼声应受到注意”。
    但是，美国政府对美国人民所提的这几个重要而具体的和平问题，拒作坦率的肯定答复。据美国新闻处二十六日报道：国务院发言人在谈话中，污蔑苏联驻安理会代表马立克肯定答复的关于美国人民所提的这一热切的和平要求，是“陈腐的宣传老调”。
