        Thirty-one, Continued Efforts
    "Did you hear? People snatched over a hundred minutes in half a month!"
    "Heard it!"
    "Technical speed of 41.8 kilometers."
    "Great!"
    The third one chimed in:
    "They also announced the work achievements for the three months of winter."
    "Is it summarized?" "How was it?" "How was it?" Everyone clamored, wanting to know first:
    "How much mileage did they get each month?"
    "7,500 kilometers."
    "How much coal did they save?"
    "166 tons. In addition, they saved 52.5 kilograms of mixed oil and 8.4 million yuan in material costs!"
    "Look at them!" "Worthy of being called the Mao Zedong Locomotive!..."
    "There's more, listen to me, listen to me, the bureau stipulated 35,000 kilometers for Class A inspection, they extended it..."
    "Extended by 5,000? 10,000?"
    "Neither guess is right! It's more than 19,600!"
    "There's more!"
    "No need to say more, no need to say more, anyway, others can't catch up, look at their January results!"
    January arrived.
    It passed quickly and intensely.
    Still running to Yimianpo, still uphill.
    Actually broke 10,000 kilometers!—ran 10,047.6!
    Far exceeding the bureau's standard!
    It is the highest record for locomotives in the entire section!
    It is also the latest record in the history of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive"!
    This impact was huge, and the new operation system was quickly promoted throughout the section.
    The entire section received a bonus of 5 million, and the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" accounted for 3 million.
    Guo Shude suggested at the team meeting: This achievement is inseparable from the factory's repair team, and part of the bonus should be given to them.
    The First Repair Team happily accepted the 400,000 yuan bonus, saying:
    "It is indeed the Mao Zedong Locomotive, fair and generous!"
    "In the future, we will repair the car even more carefully and better!" (Attached picture)

        三十一、再接再厉
    “人家半个月抢点一百多分钟，听说了吧？”
    “听说了！”
    “技术速度四十一点八公里。”
    “真棒！”
    第三个插上去了：
    “他们冬季三个月的工作成绩也宣布了。”
    “总结好了吗？”“怎么样？”“怎么样？”人人乱嘈嘈，谁都想抢先知道：
    “每月行车到多少了？”
    “七千五百公里。”
    “省了多少煤？”
    “一百六十六吨。此外还节省混合油五十二公斤半、材料费八百四十万元！”
    “你看看人家！”“配叫毛泽东号！……”
    “还有哩，听我说听我说，局方规定甲检公里三万五千，他们延长了……”
    “延长五千？一万？”
    “都没猜着！是一万九千六百多！”
    “还有哩！”
    “不用说啦，不用说啦，反正别人是追不上啦，看他们一月份的吧！”
    一月份来了。
    飞快紧张的过去了。
    还是跑一面坡，还是上坡道。
    竟突破了一万公里！——跑了一万零四十七点六！
    远远超过了局定标准！
    是全段机车的最高纪录！
    也是“毛泽东号”有史以来的最新纪录！
    这影响是巨大的，新运行制很快在全段推行开了。
    全段得奖金五百万，“毛泽东号”就占了三百万。
    郭树德在小组会上提议：这成绩是和工厂包修组分不开的，应把奖金分给他们一部分。
    第一包修组欢欢喜喜地接受了四十万奖金，他们说：
    “到底是毛泽东号，公平大方！”
    “以后把车修得还要细，还要好！”（附图片）
