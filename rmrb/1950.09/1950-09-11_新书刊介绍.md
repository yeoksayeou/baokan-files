New Book and Periodical Introductions

　　*New Observer*, Issue 6
　　The sixth issue of the current affairs periodical *New Observer* was published on the 10th. The main contents include: Mui’s "Severely Sanction American Aggressors!" provides detailed analysis and exposure of the U.S. imperialists' intensifying aggression against Taiwan, the unreasonable provocations by American planes in Northeast China, the massacre of our compatriots, and the conspiracy to expand the war of aggression and further undermine world peace. He Ping's "Vibrant Nationwide Peace Signature Campaign" provides a good explanation of the strong determination of the people across the country to enthusiastically sign and defend world peace, as well as the important influence and role that has occurred in this movement. Luo Feng's "Construction of New China's Industrial Base" reports on the achievements and experiences of industrial construction in Northeast China, with very concrete materials. Others include Guan Shuixin's "On the Development of Rural Cooperative Enterprises," Zhao Xu's "Model Advanced Production Team," Zhang Jiachi's "Savior of Private Enterprises," Qian Feng's "Travel Notes on the North China Plain," etc.
　　Regarding the introduction of model workers and heroes, there are Chu Guohua's "Recent Events Concerning Worker Flag Zhao Zhankui" and Qiu Zhuang's "Jilin Special-Class Agricultural Labor Hero Han En," among others.
　　This issue's "Current Affairs Explanation" column includes "Protesting the American Robbers' Provocations and Brutal Acts," "Great Unity of All Ethnic Groups," and "Welcome to the World Federation of Democratic Youth Delegation to China." The "News Notes" column includes "Why Did Truman Dismiss MacArthur's Statement?" and "American Activities Continuing Aggression Against Taiwan."
　　Inside the picture pages, this issue has a total of twenty-seven photos, including "New Taiyuan Under Construction," "Model of Advanced Production Team," and "Happy People."
　　*Sino-Soviet Friendship*, Volume 2, Issue 5
　　The monthly *Sino-Soviet Friendship*, edited and printed by the General Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, Volume 2, Issue 5, has been published. Important papers in this issue include the editorial of *Bolshevik* magazine: "On the New Upsurge of the Great Soviet State," Plotnikov's "Socialist State Budget," Chernigovsky's "Maintaining Creative Development of Pavlov's Scientific Heritage," and Stalin's "Answers to Comrades." The first two articles introduce the main situation of the financial budget of socialist countries; the third introduces the academic conference jointly held by the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences from June 28 to July 4 to discuss issues related to Academician Pavlov's physiological theories. From this article, one can get a glimpse of the course of the conference and its great achievements. Stalin's "Answers to Comrades" is a response to individual questions in linguistics written after "On Marxism in Linguistics" and "On Several Issues in Linguistics." In order to thank and commemorate the six Soviet scholars who came to China to lecture at the invitation of the General Council of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association from March to July this year, this issue specifically compiled a pictorial "Soviet Six Professors Lecturing in China" to reflect the general situation of the Soviet scholars' lecturing activities in China. Starting from this issue, the journal has newly opened three columns: "Soviet Knowledge Lecture Series," "Window on the Soviet Union," and "Literature and Art." "Soviet Knowledge Lecture Series" is translated from the popular political reading material "Reference Book for Political Schools" recently published in the Soviet Union. The content is rich and systematic and will be published continuously in each issue from now on. "Window on the Soviet Union" is based on news and communications from major Soviet newspapers, which are excerpted, translated and compiled. From here, you can see the current social, political, economic, cultural, scientific, and artistic aspects of life in the Soviet Union. The "Literature and Art Column" publishes Yegolin's essay "Stalin and Soviet Literature" (continued), Polivoi's factual short story "Kuzmin's Last Day," and five "Selected Soviet Poems." In addition, there are articles such as "A Major Event in Sino-Soviet Cultural Exchange" and "Visit to the Soviet State Lenin Library."
　　*People's Literature*, Volume 2, Issue 5
　　This issue of *People's Literature* focuses on introducing works from Eastern European new democratic countries. It publishes the poem "China—That is You" by Bulgarian young poet Orlinov, translated by Ge Baoquan. The poem is full of enthusiasm, expressing foreign writers' concern for the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people. In addition, there are four translated poems from Poland, Romania, Hungary, and the German Democratic Republic. There are three novels, including "Golden Apple" by Czech writer Weisskopf (currently the ambassador to China), translated by Zhu Baoguang. This is a wonderful short story. The story is simple and moving, full of a mother's love for her son, concern for the cause of justice, and full of great internationalist spirit. The picture pages introduce Romanian sculptures and Polish wood carvings. In addition, there are seven original works: Wang Zhenguang's "New Glory" and Dai Fu's "Hero at Sea" depict the images of new heroism in factories and troops. There are four theoretical criticisms, including Chen Yong's "Ding Ling's *The Sun Shines Over the Sanggan River*."
　　*People's Education*, Issue 5
　　*People's Education*, Issue 5, has been published. The main content of this issue is to prepare ideologically for the first National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education to be held in Beijing. Therefore, this issue specifically wrote "Ideological Preparation for the National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education" and Arsingjief's "Answers on Eliminating Illiteracy and Developing Workers' and Peasants' Education." The former article serves as an important reference for representatives and leading organs from various places attending the conference; the latter has principled guidance for our understanding and solving today's workers' and peasants' education issues. In addition, in the article "Preparation and Implementation of Educational Practice in Normal Colleges," the author makes a clear exposition on the direction of normal education. In addition, important articles include: "General Conditions of Family Education," "On National Morality" (Part II), Re-discussion of "Academic Style for the Sake of Academic," "Several Experiences in Class Teacher Work," "How We Reform Our Chinese Language Teaching," as well as "Question and Answer," "Cultural Learning in the Army," and "Educational Documents," among others.
　　*Beijing Worker*, Volume 2, Issue 3
　　The bi-monthly *Beijing Worker*, Volume 2, Issue 3, was published on September 1. The main content of this issue includes current affairs talks: "American Imperialism Suffered a Major Defeat in Korea and Had to Use Planes to Indiscriminately Bomb Peaceful Residents"; "Continue to Expand the Peace Signature Campaign and Strive for Everyone in Organized Masses to Sign." On the production front, there is: "Only Competition Can Achieve Results," which writes about the production situation of foundry workers in the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. "Our Company Has Produced a Great Hero," which writes about the production competition of workers in the repair shop of the Bus Company. "From Losing Money to Making Money," written by Li Shuping, a clerk in a state-owned medicine store, and "Labor-Capital Consultation Meetings Really Work" of the Zihua Weaving Factory. There is also a small anti-Japanese story about militiamen written by the writer Kang Zhuo: "Tunnel Warfare."
