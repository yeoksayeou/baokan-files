　　Review of "High School Modern Chinese History" (Volume 1)
　　Chen Changbo

According to the opinion of the History Teaching Group of Guangzhou Pui Ching Middle School, Song Yunbin's "High School Modern Chinese History" (Volume 1) is a simplified version of Song's original work, "A Century of Modern Chinese History." The opinion stated that "the original book had a smooth and coherent writing style." However, the adaptation into a textbook, due to the division into chapters, lost the original advantages. I have not read the original "A Century of Modern Chinese History," but as far as I know, this textbook can be described as a not-so-clever abridgment of Li Jianong's "Recent Thirty Years of Chinese Political History" (published by Shanghai Pacific Bookstore in 1930). From the Reform Movement onward, Song's book almost entirely follows Li's book's threads, even the tone has not changed much, sometimes even whole paragraphs are copied, plus some recent explanations. If I were to give examples, I would have to copy the entire book. If teachers teaching this book can find Li's book for reference, that would be extremely convenient (Li Jianong also has "A Century of Modern Chinese Political History," but I don't have this book on hand, so I can't determine the relationship between the textbook and it).

Historical works rarely have originality. Especially textbooks, most of them are compiled. We are not saying that we cannot adopt the advantages of others, but like this, completely using a modern history work published twenty years ago as the base, under today's new situation, it is not enough. Moreover, Li's book is marked as a political history, which makes the editor always unable to integrate the new explanations, even accidentally falling into the old rut, losing the position, although he attempts to add new explanations. Readers only see many reactionary rulers, warlords, and bureaucrats active there, but cannot see the clues of modern Chinese social economy and revolutionary development.

The teachers of Pui Ching Middle School praised this textbook as having "correct viewpoints and clear organization." I think it's a bit of an overstatement. In terms of layout, the opinion says that the original book had subheadings at the beginning of chapters, and "the textbook should retain them appropriately," which is a very correct view. The textbook is divided into six chapters, and each chapter is divided into sections. Some sections are as long as ten pages, and they don’t even bother to divide them into paragraphs. The whole book is black and dense, without leaving a space (such as pages 64-65, 188-189), which not only makes students daunted and feels heavy and dull, but also makes the outline unclear. Reading it in a lengthy manner, it is not easy to grasp the central points. Lack of clear organization is the biggest shortcoming of this book.

The following are individual facts for discussion.

A. Belonging to principles:

(1) Chapter 4, "The Coup of 1898 to the Boxer Rebellion," is after the chapter "The Sino-Japanese War," while the Westernization Movement is attached to the first section of Chapter 4 ("From Westernization to Reform"). The loss of vassal states before the Sino-Japanese War is attached to the Sino-Japanese War chapter. The Westernization Movement started in 1862, far before the Sino-Japanese War. The textbook's arrangement is not clear enough in terms of time concept. It is better to follow the "Junior High School Modern Chinese History Textbook" compiled by the History Research Office of North China University, and use "The Westernization Movement and the Scramble for Concessions" as a chapter, placed before the "Sino-Japanese War." This is both consistent in time and allows students to clearly see that people like Li Hongzhang were both running the so-called "enriching the country and strengthening the army" Westernization, while constantly signing many unequal treaties with aggressors, losing land and humiliating the country, is a thorough capitulationist. It exposes that the so-called "enriching the country and strengthening the army" is all deception, and finally "ran" out of the Sino-Japanese War, announcing the complete bankruptcy of the "Westernization Movement."

Secondly, the word "Boxer Rebellion" is a very serious laziness (saying "laziness," because the four words "Gengzi Boxer Rebellion" are also copied from Li's book program. I believe that Song will not recognize the anti-imperialist movement of the Righteous Harmony Society as "rebellion," but just took it casually when writing, without thinking about it. In fact, many shortcomings or errors in the textbook are due to "taking it casually," to put it nicely, it is "hastily written").

(2) Page 34, "The two Guangdong provinces have been hit by famine for years, and bandits have risen everywhere." The error is the same as "Boxer Rebellion."

(3) Pages 42-43, almost two pages are used to quote and explain Zeng Guofan's "Exhortation to the Cantonese Bandits"; but for the revolutionary proclamation of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, not a single word is mentioned. It is really inappropriate to take and remove historical materials.

(4) Page 48, for the foreign gun teams that helped the Qing Dynasty to put down the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, they are called "Ever Victorious Army," it is inevitable to increase the prestige of others and destroy their own spirit. In fact, the foreign gun teams were often defeated by the Taiping Army on the battlefield. Calling them the "Ever Victorious Army" is the self-promotion of the aggressors and their slaves. Also, page 44 says that in the early days of the revolution, the powers adopted a neutral attitude, "but the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom lacked diplomatic talents." As if as long as there are diplomatic talents, the aggressors will not help the Qing Dynasty. In fact, the aggressors took advantage of the revolutionary era to extort many benefits from the Qing Dynasty. After the Treaty of Tianjin was signed, their interests were unified with the Qing Dynasty, and they were eager to eliminate the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom and open up the market along the Yangtze River.

(5) Page 116, "The Boxers used up the so-called 'magic weapons' such as soul-inducing banners, mixed sky flags, thunder fire fans, yin and yang bottles, nine links, wishful hooks, water cards, flying swords, etc., but none of them worked, only killed a German minister, Klint." This is really the so-called "striving for more and more." Listing so many "magic weapons" is not only completely unnecessary, but the attitude is also a big problem, and it is inevitable to have a suspicion of cold irony and ridicule of the Boxers, at least not serious enough. Also, it was Dong Fuxiang's army that killed Klint, not the Boxers, and it should be corrected.

(6) Page 202 says that Yuan Shikai "this generation of treacherous heroes, passed away in anger, remorse, and shame (note that it should be 'resign,' if you say 'pass away,' you can't 'with the world,' because the world will not perish with Yuan Shikai)." "Remorse and shame" I don't know what the basis is. And the tone seems to have infinite sympathy for the death of the thief Yuan, and even reluctant to say the word "death." This is a kind of literary man playing with words and ink, playing with spears, "harming the meaning with words." Page 139, the deaths of the Empress Dowager Cixi and Emperor Guangxu are all used as "collapse," although brackets are added, but ordinary students will not understand the wonderful use of brackets, and its disadvantages are the same as above.

(7) The book uses a lot of space to describe Yuan Shikai's usurpation of power, dictatorship, and betrayal of the country, but it does not mention a word about the fake public opinion telegram that "shows the process of Yuan's henchmen singing a puppet show of public opinion, and at the same time reflects a common secret of the landlord and comprador classes ruling the nation since the end of the Qing Dynasty and the Republic of China." This makes him feel "particularly rare" about the so-called national system voting of 1,913 votes completely advocating monarchy, "the national congresses of various provinces even pushed the emperor to the throne during the national system voting, and the wording of the promotion books was the same in all provinces." As Chen Boda said, without experiencing these secrets, "one will not understand the politics of the Chinese landlord and comprador class, and will show one's own immaturity." (See "Yuan Shikai, the Stealing Thief") The Yuan Shikai imperial system section of the textbook can be determined that these are based on Li's political history as a blueprint, but the confidential telegrams that were fully recorded in the political history were discarded, so it is said to be a not-so-clever abridgment.

(8) In the book, the years are recorded in many places using the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches, and the months and days are mostly in the lunar calendar. The style is not pure, and it should be uniformly changed to the Gregorian calendar.

(9) In the book, the Qing emperors are all customarily referred to by the year name plus the word "Emperor," such as "Emperor Xianfeng" and "Emperor Guangxu," without using names and posthumous names, which is indeed convenient. Only the Empress Dowager Cixi is called "Nala Empress," which seems unnecessary.

B. Belonging to historical facts:

(1) Page 7, "The British Parliament passed the declaration of war against China after three days and three nights of debate. In February 1840, the British government ordered mobilization..." It is found that in February 1840, Britain sent George Elliott as the plenipotentiary minister for negotiations with China, as a prelude to military action. In April, the Parliament passed the declaration of war, and officially dispatched the invading army, led by George Elliott. Although the textbook does not specify the date of the declaration of war, the meaning of the text seems to be before February. Also, it is not appropriate to issue a mobilization order in February. And the Parliament may not continue to meet at night. Most books say "fierce debate for three days." Adding "three nights" in the textbook may also be inappropriate. The reason why the debate was so fierce was because some members believed that the opium trade was a disgraceful trade and should not start a war because of it. It should also be mentioned briefly so that students can understand that the British cannot deny that the Opium War was a disgraceful war on the British side.

(2) Page 26, Aigun Treaty "(1) Ceded the area of Yaksa on the north bank of the Ussuri River to Russia," the Ussuri River is a mistake for the Heilongjiang River.

(3) Page 34, the Taiping Army "took Quanzhou, and successively fell to Guiyang, Anren, Chaling, Liling and other counties. They besieged Changsha, but could not take it down for two months, and Feng Yunshan and Xiao Chaogui died in battle one after another." Feng Yunshan was killed in Suoyi Ferry, Quanzhou, and Xiao Chaogui died in the siege of Changsha. The text has the disadvantage of making people mistakenly think that Feng Yunshan also died in Changsha.

(4) Page 41, Yang and Wei's infighting "Shi Dakai rushed back from Anqing upon hearing the news." At that time, Shi Dakai was in Hongshan, Hubei. Upon hearing the change, he returned to Nanjing to blame Chang Hui for excessive killing. Chang Hui wanted to kill Dakai, and Dakai began to raise troops in Anqing to quell the rebellion. He did not rush back from Anqing at first.

(5) Page 45, "Zeng Guofan once led a part of the army to attack Jinggang," Zeng Guofan led the navy, so he drowned himself after being defeated by the Taiping Army.

(6) Page 63, "In 1802, Nguyen Phuc Anh unified Annam with the help of French troops, and agreed in advance to cede Huainan Island to France as a reward. Afterwards, Nguyen Phuc Anh did not fulfill his promise, and the French government was very dissatisfied." The Franco-Annam alliance was drafted in 1787, but it was not signed due to the French Revolution. Although the Annam King had obtained French aid, it cannot be said that not implementing the unsigned treaty is a failure to fulfill the promise. In 1856, France again requested the implementation of the treaty, which was 69 years apart, obviously just an excuse.

(7) Page 72, Sino-Japanese War "Li Hongzhang had to reluctantly prepare for war under the urging of the whole country, but... only used the transport ships Gaosheng and Caojiang to transport a small number of troops... to aid Yasan... while sailing, they were attacked by Japanese warships." Page 74, "When the Korean rebellion first broke out, only the Jiyuan ship led the Yangwei and Pingyuan ships to go. When the Japanese army gathered, the Jiyuan commander Fang Baiqian surrendered with the Jiyuan ship. Li Hongzhang recalled all the ships back to the country. When Japan captured the Korean king, the situation worsened, and the Weiyuan, Guangyi and other ships were sent to Yasan one after another... while sailing, they were attacked by Japanese warships and fled in embarrassment." It should be the Battle of Fengdao on July 25th. When Sino-Japanese negotiations were extremely serious, Li Hongzhang sent 2,000 troops to aid Yasan, hiring British merchant ships, Gaosheng, and other three ships to transport troops, and the warship Caojiang escorted them. The Tianjin telegrapher sold the news to Japan. On the 25th, the Gaosheng and other ships arrived at Yasan. The Jiyuan and Guangyi, which were originally anchored in Yasan, came to meet them, and were attacked by Japanese warships. (On this day, the Japanese army began to attack the Chinese garrison in Yasan, and the war broke out.) The Jiyuan escaped, the Guangyi was injured, and the captain set fire to it and led the crowd to Yasan. The Gaosheng was sunk, and the Caojiang surrendered. Textbook errors: (1) The Gaosheng was not a transport ship, but a British merchant ship. Li Hongzhang "always dared to act only with some foreign relations" (Fan Wenlan, "Modern History of China"), also hoping that Britain would intervene. (2) The Jiyuan once raised a white flag to surrender in this battle, but the Japanese warships were relentless, so they fired and hit the Japanese warship and escaped. Fang Baiqian falsely claimed credit and defrauded 2,000 taels of silver. Later, in the Battle of the Yalu River, he escaped again, and accidentally crashed and sank the Yangwei. Fang Baiqian was killed on the 24th of the ninth lunar month for fleeing before the battle ("Chronicle of Major Events in China in Sixty Years"). The textbook says that the Jiyuan surrendered before the war started, which is wrong.

(8) Page 74, "Yasan was lost, the Chinese army gathered in Pyongyang, a great battle was imminent, Li Hongzhang sent Naval Admiral Ding Ruchang to lead the fleet to support. At that time, the Japanese navy had dominated the Korean waters. When the Chinese fleet arrived at the sea near the Dadonggou at the mouth of the Yalu River, it was attacked by Japanese warships and fought in a panic." Page 75, "The Chinese fleet was defeated, the Jingyuan ship was captured, and the Zhiyuan, Chaoyong, Yangwei, and Guangbing ships were sunk." (1) On August 13 (lunar calendar), Li Hongzhang sent Liu Shengxiu to lead 12 battalions of the Ming army by ship to aid Pyongyang, escorted by Ding Ruchang leading the fleet. The army landed in Dadonggou, and the fleet planned to return to Lushun. On the 18th (September 17 Gregorian calendar), they encountered Japanese warships on the sea off Dadonggou. The war occurred several days after the Chinese fleet arrived in Dadonggou. The textbook's "arrived when...was attacked" is wrong. (2) No Chinese warships surrendered in this battle. The Jingyuan and Zhiyuan were injured and planned to drive fast to hit the Japanese warships, but they were sunk by mines. (3) The Guangbing was not sunk, and later collectively surrendered to Japan with the Beiyang Fleet in Weihaiwei. The Guangdong authorities wrote to Japan requesting its return because the Guangbing belonged to the Guangdong Fleet, saying that the war had nothing to do with Guangdong. (4) After the fierce battle, both sides retreated. Although China sank four or five warships, the main ships Dingyuan and Zhenyuan were unharmed. The Japanese ships Hiei, Akagi, Saijo, and Matsushima were seriously damaged (Fan's book says one sunk), and nearly 300 officers and soldiers were killed and injured. And China had torpedo boats, but Japan did not, and dared not pursue. Therefore, this battle can only be said to be a small defeat, not a "big defeat." Saying "big defeat" is Li Hongzhang's deliberate exaggeration, "as an excuse to implement a consistent defeatism" (Fan Wenlan). Also, in this battle, Zhiyuan commander Deng Shichang and Jingyuan commander Lin Yongsheng both wanted to crash into Japanese warships and die with the entire ship's soldiers. Army commander Zuo Baogui died in Pyongyang, and his whole family was martyred. They should all be praised.

(9) Page 114, "Shandong Governor Li Bingheng... greatly rewarded the Righteous Harmony Boxing, thus leading to the Caozhou Case in 1897. Li Bingheng was therefore dismissed. The succeeding Governor Yuxian still tried his best to protect the Righteous Harmony Boxing... so the Righteous Harmony Society openly operated." The Empress Dowager Cixi "heard that the Righteous Harmony Society had magic to drive away foreigners, and was naturally very happy." Yuxian killed more than 2,000 members of the Righteous Harmony Society in one year during his tenure as Prefect of Caozhou in 1896, hence the name "Yuxian the Butcher." Appointing him as Governor at this time was of course to have him slaughter the Righteous Harmony Boxing. After he took office, he sent troops to investigate, but was killed by thousands of Righteous Harmony Boxing members. Because he had boasted to the Qing court in advance that "the bandits have been eliminated," he could not ask for assistance, and the Righteous Harmony Boxing put forward the slogan "Support the Qing and Destroy the Foreigners" in order to absorb anti-Christian masses. Yuxian was originally a stubborn faction and hated foreigners. At this point, he issued a notice changing the Righteous Harmony Boxing to the "Righteous Harmony Regiment," expressing his recognition as a folk militia, and the Righteous Harmony Society openly operated. This kind of publicity was obtained through struggle. Yuxian did not protect the Righteous Harmony Society from the beginning, but was forced to cooperate with the Righteous Harmony Society after being repeatedly defeated by it in order to maintain his position. The Empress Dowager Cixi was the same. Six days before the declaration of war, she also ordered "strictly arresting the troublemaking Boxer bandits, handing them over to the Ministry of Justice for legal handling, and demolishing all the altars and sheds in the city." But the foreigners were pressing her, and the power of the Righteous Harmony Society overwhelmed it. She was finally forced to declare war, but she was not "very happy" with the Righteous Harmony Society, so only five days after the declaration of war, she began to suppress the Righteous Harmony Society and stop providing aid to it. On the one hand, she surrendered to imperialism, but on the other hand, she ordered the Righteous Harmony Society to continue to besiege the embassy. It is necessary to expose this kind of conspiracy to kill people with a knife.

(10) Page 115, "The Righteous Harmony Society killed Sugiyama Akira, the secretary of the Japanese embassy," is also incorrect. Sugiyama Akira was also killed by Dong Fuxiang's army. The diplomatic corps had proposed to the Qing Dynasty to transfer Dong's army to a place 50 miles away from Beijing, so Dong deeply hated foreigners.

(11) Page 157, on the eve of the Wuchang Uprising, Ruicheng "secretly agreed with the consul of a certain country to request military ships to enter Wuhan to suppress the uprising." Which country is it, why not say it clearly?

(12) Page 159, Hunan became independent, and Jiao Dafeng was the governor. The original note: "Jiao was soon killed, and Tan Yankai became the governor." This is a conspiracy by the constitutionalists to massacre true revolutionary elements and usurp revolutionary power. This conspiracy finally destroyed the revolution and led to the failure of the Xinhai Revolution. It should be solemnly pointed out that the textbook is too brief. The situation in Jiangsu is the same.

C. Belonging to typos or proofreading omissions:

(1) Page 46, "Xiucheng swore an oath to Zongyang," "Zong" should be "Cong."

(2) Page 53, line 13, "Zhengjiang" should be "Chengjiang."

(3) Page 77, line 5, "Rongcheng" should be "Rongcheng."

(4) Page 78, line 4, "Shao Wenqian," "Qian" should be "Lian."

(5) Page 143, line 5, "Lu Haodong," "Hao" should be "Hao."

(6) Page 144, line 13, "Huang Dusheng," "Huang" is a mistake for "Yang."

(7) Page 147, line 2, the first meeting of the Tongmenghui in Beijing was in "1903," "3" should be "5."

(8) Page 152, line 7, Xiong Chengji "assassinated Zaixun," "Xun" should be "Tao."

(9) Page 157 and 158, the Governor of Huguang, Ruicheng, is mentioned three times, and "Cheng" is mistakenly written as "Zheng" each time.

(10) Page 160, Su Fu Cheng Dequan, "Cheng" is mistakenly written as "Chen."

(11) Page 213, line 9, "Cao Kun," "Kun" should be "Kun."

(12) Page 218, "Guangdong Military Governor Chen Jiongming," should be "Chen Bingkun."

Finally, it should be said that this textbook is basically correct and progressive. It is completely different from the textbooks edited in the era of the Kuomintang reactionary rule and cannot be compared. But to meet today's new situation and new requirements, it is obviously not enough. We urgently hope that it can be adapted, and are willing to put forward several principles as a reference for adaptation:

(1) The organization should be clear. The chapter titles should be as concise and clear as possible to put forward the basic nature of each historical period or historical event in coordination. The paragraphs should be divided under the sections, and there should also be subheadings at the beginning of the book, so that students can have a clear concept first. The writing should be divided into more paragraphs to seek clarity. Because the textbook's organization is not clear enough, and there are no subheadings, students mostly feel that they cannot grasp the key points of the book. In our teaching practice, we have had to write outlines separately.

(2) Strive for simplicity. The whole book is 226 pages (if it is arranged in the general textbook format with more paragraphs, it may add 20-30 pages); with 15 weeks of actual teaching per semester, a total of 45 hours (actually mostly less than this number), each hour needs to teach 5 pages, which is already difficult to chew thoroughly, not to mention that new materials need to be added during adaptation, and there are really many unnecessary or redundant places in the textbook, which should be deleted as much as possible, such as Zeng Guofan's proclamation and the "magic weapons" of the Righteous Harmony Society mentioned above. The evolution of political parties and factions in the early Republic of China are all disturbances of unprincipled bureaucratic politicians, which can be simplified a bit - Pui Ching's opinion says "not very detailed, it seems that it should be added," I think saying a few more words will still not make students clear about these unprincipled disturbances. If it is really necessary, the list method of "Chinese Political History" can be adopted.

(3) Supplement necessary new materials, such as the fake public opinion telegrams of Yuan Shikai mentioned above, I think they should all be included. No amount of narration and explanation can paint the original form of Yuan Shikai (and even the original form of Chiang Kai-shek's "National Congress Representatives," "Legislators," and "Presidents") as clearly as these short twelve telegrams. There is also a lack of information on social and economic development; the development of Chinese capitalism before the Xinhai Revolution should be increased and made into a separate section (attached to the section "Economic Aggression Against China by the Powers and Its Impact" in the textbook) in order to better explain the nature of the Xinhai Revolution.

History is a weapon of class struggle, and its role in ideological education is even greater than that of political lessons. We urgently need a more complete textbook to facilitate teaching and better accomplish the task of history teaching.

　　评《高中本国近代史》（上册）
    陈昌勃
    宋云彬《高中本国近代史》（上册），据广州培正中学历史科教学小组的意见书说，是由宋氏原著《中国近百年史》简编而成的，“原书行文流畅，一气呵成。”改编成课本，为了分章节的关系，失去了原来的优点。我没有看过原著《中国近百年史》，但就我所知，这本课本实在可说是李剑农《最近三十年中国政治史》（一九三○年上海太平洋书店出版）的不很高明的节本。李书起于维新运动，宋书从维新运动一节起就几乎完全依照着李书的线索节录，连语气也没有多少改变，有时甚至是整段照抄，再加上一些新近的解释而已。如果要举例，势非抄完全书不可。读者可拿两书对照。教授这本书的先生若能觅得李书做参考，那真方便极了（李剑农另有《中国近百年政治史》，手头没有这书，不能断定课本和它的关系）。
    历史著作这东西，原也少有创作。尤其是课本之类，多是编纂而成的；我们并不是说不能采取他人的优点，但是像这样完全拿二十年前出版的近代史著作做底子，在今天新形势之下，无论如何是不够的。何况李书还标明是政治史，这就使得编者虽然企图加上新的解释，却总是不能水乳交融，甚至一不小心，就滑落旧窠臼，失去立场。读者只见到许多反动统治者、军阀、官僚在那里活动，却看不出近代中国社会经济和革命发展的线索来。
    培正中学的先生们称赞这课本“观点正确，条理清楚。”我认为有些溢美。就编排说，意见书说原著书头有小标题，“课本应酌予保留”，这是极正确的见解。课本分六章，章下分节，每节有长达十页的，连分段也懒得分，全编黑压压，不留一空格，（如六四页至六五页，一八八页至一八九页），不但使学生望而生畏，有苦重沉闷之感，而且眉目不清醒，连篇累牍，读了也不容易把捉到中心要点。条理不分明，正是本书最大的缺点。
    以下提出个别事实的商榷。
    甲、属于原则性的：
    （一）第四章《戊戌政变到庚子拳乱》在《甲午战争》一章之后，而以洋务运动附于第四章第一节（《从洋务到维新》），甲午战前藩属的丧失则附于甲午一章。查洋务运动起于一八六二年，远在甲午之前，课本这样编排，在时间观念上不够明晰，不如依华北大学历史研究室编的《初中中国近代史课本》，以《洋务运动与割地狂潮》为一章，放在《甲午战争》之前，时间上既吻合，且可使学生明白看出李鸿章之流一面在办所谓“富国强兵”的洋务，一面却不断的和侵略者订立许多失地丧权辱国的不平等条约，是彻底的投降主义者。揭发所谓“富国强兵”全是欺人之谈，终于“办”出了甲午战争，宣告“洋务运动”的全部破产。
    其次“拳乱”二字，是一个非常严重的偷懒（说“偷懒”，因为“庚子拳乱”四字也是从李书节目上抄下来的，相信宋氏不会认义和团的反帝运动是“作乱”，不过编写时信手拈来，不加考虑而已，其实课本许多缺点或错误，都由于“信手拈来”，说得好听一点，就是“匆促成书”）。
    （二）三十四页“两广连年饥荒，盗匪蜂起”，错误与“拳乱”同。
    （三）四二——四三页，几乎以两页的篇幅引述和解释曾国藩的《讨粤匪檄》；而对于太平天国的革命檄文，竟没有只字提及，于史料的取去之间，实在不适当。
    （四）四八页对于侵略者替满清帮凶扑灭太平天国革命的洋枪队，都称“常胜军”未免长他人威风，灭自己锐气。事实上洋枪队在战场上常被太平军击败，称“常胜军”是侵略者及其奴才的自我宣传。又四四页说革命初期，列强采取中立态度，“但太平天国缺乏外交人才”。仿佛只要有外交人才，侵略者就不会给满清帮凶似的。实际上是侵略者乘革命时代，向满清敲诈得许多利益，天津条约订立后，他们的利害跟满清统一起来，急于要消灭太平天国，开拓长江沿岸的市场了。
    （五）一一六页“义和团用尽了引魂幡，混天大旗、雷火扇、阴阳瓶、九连环、如意钩、水牌、飞剑等等所谓‘法宝’，一些儿效验都没有，仅仅杀了一个德国公使克林德。”这真是所谓“务多为博”，列举这许多“法宝”，不但全无必要，而态度上也大成问题，难免有对义和团冷嘲热讽之嫌，至少也不够严肃。又杀克林德的是董福祥军，不是义和团，也应当改正。
    （六）二○二页说袁世凯“这一代奸雄，在愤怒、懊悔、惭愧的心情之下与世长逝（按当作“辞”，若说“长逝”，就不能“与世”，因为世界是不会跟袁世凯一同毁灭的）了”。“懊悔、惭愧”四字不知有什么根据。而语气好像对袁贼之死无限同情，连“死”字也不忍说。这是一种文人舞文弄墨，耍花枪的把戏，“以辞害意”了。一三九页西太后和光绪帝的死，皆用“驾崩”，虽然加上括弧，但一般学生不是都会领会括弧的妙用的，其弊与上同。
    （七）书中用来叙述袁世凯的窃权、独裁、卖国的篇幅不能说不多，惟独于“表现出袁氏党徒唱民意傀儡剧的经过，同时反映出清末和民国以来大地主大买办阶级统治民族一种共同的秘密”的伪造民意密电，却一字不提。这就使得他对于所谓国体投票一千九百十三票完全主张君主，“各省国民代表大会在国体投票时竟连皇帝都推戴定了，推戴书的文字各省一律”，觉得“尤为希奇”。诚如陈伯达所说，不体验这些秘密，“就不会通晓中国大地主大买办的政治，就会表现自己的幼稚。”（见《窃国大盗袁世凯》）课本袁世凯帝制一节，可以断定这些采用李著政治史做蓝本，而却把政治史里备录的密电丢弃了，所以说它是不高明的节本。
    （八）书中纪年，许多地方用干支，纪月日多用阴历，体例不纯，应一律改用公元。
    （九）书中称清帝皆依习惯用年号加一“帝”字，如“咸丰帝”，“光绪帝”，不用名及谥，确实方便，独于西太后则称“那拉后”，似可不必。
    乙、属于史实的：
    （一）七页“英国国会经过了三天三夜的辩论，通过了对中国的宣战案。一八四○年二月英政府下令动员……”查英国于一八四○年二月派乔治义律为对华谈判全权大臣，为军事行动先声，四月国会通过宣战案，始正式派遣侵略军，以乔治义律统率陆军。课本虽未说明宣战日期，文意似在二月以前。又以二月下动员令，皆欠妥。且国会夜里未必继续开会，各书多说“激辩三日”，课本加“三夜”，恐也有未妥。辩论所以这样剧烈，是因为议员中有人认鸦片贸易是不名誉的贸易，不能因此开战，也应略说，使学生明白英人也不能否认鸦片战争在英国方面说是不名誉的战争。
    （二）二六页爱珲条约“（一）割乌苏里江北岸雅克萨一带为俄国领土”，乌苏里江是黑龙江之误。
    （三）三四页太平军“取全州，连陷桂阳、安仁、茶陵、醴陵等县。进围长沙，两月不能下，而冯云山、萧朝贵先后阵亡。”按冯云山战死于全州蓑衣渡，萧朝贵则死于围长沙之役。文义有使人误冯云山也死于长沙之弊。
    （四）四一页杨韦内讧“石达开闻讯，从安庆赶回”，按当时石达开在湖北洪山，闻变回南京，责昌辉残杀太甚，昌辉欲杀达开，达开始走安庆举兵靖难，初非从安庆赶回。
    （五）四五页“曾国藩曾自率一部陆军攻靖港”，查曾贼所率为水师，所以被太平军打败了就投水寻死。
    （六）六三页“一八○二年阮福映借法国兵力统一安南，事前允许割化南岛给法国作为酬报，事后阮福映不实践诺言，法政府大为不满。”查一七八七年法安同盟草约，因法国发生大革命没有签押，后来安南王虽曾得法国之助，但决不能说不实行未签押之条约为不践诺言。一八五六年法国再要求实行条约，已隔了六十九年，显然不过是一种借口。
    （七）七二页甲午战争“李鸿章在全国上下督促之下，不得不勉强备战，但……只用运输舰高升、操江运载少数陆军……以援牙山……驶至中途，被日舰袭击。”七四页“当朝鲜变乱初起时，仅派济远舰率扬威、平远两舰前往，等到日军大集，济远管带方柏谦以济远舰投降，李鸿章竟尽召诸舰回国。等到日本俘虏朝鲜王，局势更恶化，才又派威远、广乙等舰，先后驶至牙山……行至中途，即受日舰袭击，狼狈逃回。”按二处都未说明日期，应当同是七月二十五日丰岛之役。当中日交涉极端严重时，李鸿章才派兵二千人往援牙山，雇英国商轮高升号等三轮运兵，使军舰操江号护送。天津电报生将消息出卖给日本。二十五日高升轮等抵牙山，原泊牙山之济远、广乙出迎，被日舰邀击。（这一天日陆军开始进攻牙山中国驻军，战争从此爆发）济远逃遁，广乙受伤，舰长举火焚毁，率众奔牙山，高升被击沉，操江投降。课本错误：（一）高升不是运输舰，是英国商船，李鸿章“总要带一些外国关系才敢行动”（范文澜《中国近代史》），还希望英国因此出面干涉。（二）济远于此役曾升白旗投降，但日舰穷迫不已，始发炮击中日舰逃脱，方柏谦反饰功骗得二千两赏银。后来在大东沟之役，他又逃遁，误撞沉扬威。旧历九月二十四日方柏谦以临阵先逃被戮（《中国六十年大事记》）。课本说济远在开战前就投降，是错误。
    （八）七四页“牙山失守，中国大军云集平壤，大战迫在眉睫，李鸿章才派海军提督丁汝昌率舰队前往应援。那时候日本海军已雄据朝鲜海面，当中国舰队到达鸭绿江口大东沟附近海面时，即遭日舰攻击，仓皇应战。”七五页“中国舰队大败，经远舰被俘，致远、超勇、扬威、广丙四舰被击沉。”按：（一）八月十三日（旧历）李鸿章派刘盛休统率铭字军十二营乘船往援平壤，由丁汝昌率舰队护送，陆军在大东沟登陆，舰队拟驶回旅顺，十八日（阳历九月十七）在大东沟海面与日舰遭遇。战争发生在中国舰队到达大东沟后数日，课本“到达时………即遭攻击”有误。（二）此役中国兵舰无投降者，经远与致远皆受伤，拟开快车撞日舰，中雷沉没。（三）广丙未被击沉，后于威海卫和北洋舰队集体投日，广东当局曾致书日本要求放还，因为广丙属广东舰队，谓此次战争和广东无关。（四）激战后双方收队，中国虽沉没了四五艘兵舰，但主力舰定远镇远无恙，日舰有比睿、赤城、西京、松岛等受重伤（范书说一艘沉没），死伤官兵近三百名，且中国有水雷艇，日方没有，不敢追击。所以此役只能说是小败，不是“大败”。说“大败”是李鸿章故意夸张，“作为借口，实行一贯的失败主义”（范文澜）。又此役致远管带邓世昌、经远管带林永升都欲撞日舰以俱沉，与全舰兵士壮烈牺牲，陆军总兵左宝贵战死平壤，全家殉难，都应当表扬一下。
    （九）一一四页“山东巡抚李秉衡………对义和拳大加奖励，因此酿成一八九七年的曹州教案，李秉衡因此革职，继任的巡抚毓贤，对义和拳仍竭力庇护………于是义和团公开活动。”西太后“听到义和团有法术可以赶走洋人，自然也十分高兴。”查毓贤于一八九六年曹州知府任内，一年中杀义和拳二千余人，因此有“毓屠户”之称，这时候任命他做巡抚，当然是要他来屠杀义和拳，他到任后派兵查办，反而被义和拳杀死数千人。因为事前向清廷夸说过“匪已肃清”，不能请援，而义和拳为了吸收反教群众，提出“扶清灭洋”口号，毓贤原是顽固派，仇恨洋人，至此出告示改称义和拳为“义和团”，表示承认为民间团练，义和团才公开活动起来。这种公开，是经过斗争得来的。毓贤并不是一开始就庇护义和团，而是在屡次被义和团打败，为了保住地位，才被迫和义和团合作的。西太后也是一样，宣战前六日，她还下令“严拿滋事拳匪，交刑部法办，城内坛棚尽行拆除。”但洋人进迫着她，义和团的力量压倒了它，她终于被迫宣战，但对义和团并不“十分高兴”，所以仅仅在宣战后五日，就开始压制义和团，停止对义和团接济。一面进行向帝国主义投降，但一面又令义和团继续围攻使馆。对于这种借刀杀人的阴谋，有揭发的必要。
    （十）一一五页“义和团戕杀日本使馆书记官杉山彬”，也不对，杉山彬也是董福祥军杀的。公使团曾向满清提出把董军调驻于距北京五十里以外之地，董因此深恨洋人。
    （十一）一五七页武昌起义前夜，瑞澄“秘密与某国领事相约，请调军舰入武汉，以资镇压。”到底是哪一国，为什么不明白说出来？
    （十二）一五九页湖南独立，焦达丰为都督，原注：“焦不久被害，由谭延闓任都督。”按这是立宪派屠杀真正的革命分子篡夺革命政权的阴谋，这种阴谋终于破坏了革命，使辛亥革命陷于失败，应该郑重指出，课本太简略。江苏方面情形也一样。
    丙、属于笔误或校对疏忽的：
    （一）四六页“秀成誓师纵阳”，“纵”应作“枞”。
    （二）五三页十三行“征江”应作“澄江”。
    （三）七七页五行“荣城”应作“荣成”。
    （四）七八页四行“邵文谦”，“谦”应作“濂”。
    （五）一四三页五行“陆浩东”，“浩”应作“皓”。
    （六）一四四页十三行“黄笃生”，“黄”是“杨”之误。
    （七）一四七页二行同盟会比京第一次会在“一九○三”年，“三”应作“五”。
    （八）一五二页七行熊成基“谋刺载洵”，“洵”应作“涛”。
    （九）一五七页一五八页三次说到湖广总督瑞澄，“澄”都误作“征”。
    （十）一六○页苏抚程德全，“程”误作“陈”。
    （十一）二一三页九行“曹琨”，“琨”当作“锟”。
    （十二）二一八页“广东督军陈炯明”，应作“陈炳焜”。
    最后，应当说：这本课本基本上是正确的，进步的，它和国民党反动统治时代编辑的课本有天渊之别，不可同日而语，但要满足今天的新形势、新要求，它显然是不够的。我们迫切希望能够加以改编，并愿提出几个原则，作为改编时的参考：
    （一）条理要分明，章节标题尽可能扼要明确的把每一历史时期或历史事件的基本性质配合提出，节之下分段，书头也要有小标题，使学生先有一个明确的观念。行文要多分段，以求清醒。为了课本条理不够分明，和没有小标题，学生大多感到把捉不到书中的重点，我们在教学的实践中，曾不得不另写提纲。
    （二）力求精简，全书二百二十六页（假如按一般课本多分段的编排法，可能增加二三十页）；以每学期实授十五星期计，共四十五小时（实际多不及此数），每小时须讲授五页，已嫌咀嚼不烂，何况改编时势需加上新材料，而且课本中实在有许多不必要或累赘噜嗦的地方，应尽量删去，如前述曾国藩檄文和义和团“法宝”。民初政党和派系的演化，都是一些无原则的官僚政客的纷扰，可以简略一点——培正意见书说“不甚详明，似应加以补充”，我以为多说几句，也还是不能使学生弄清楚这些无原则的纷扰，如确有必要，可采取《中国政治史》列表的办法。
    （三）补充必需的新材料，如前述袁世凯伪造民意密电，我以为应全部收入。多少叙说和解释，都没有这短短十二封电文把袁世凯的原形（以至蒋介石的什么“国大代表”、“立法委员”、“总统”的原形，画得这样清楚。关于社会经济发展的资料也嫌不够；辛亥革命前中国资本主义的发展，应增加材料，独立为一节（课本附于《列强对华的经济侵略及其影响》节内），才能更好的说明辛亥革命的性质。
    历史学是阶级斗争的武器，它在思想教育中所起的作用，甚至比政治课还要大。我们迫切需要一本更完善的课本，以便利教学的进行，更好的完成历史教学的任务。
