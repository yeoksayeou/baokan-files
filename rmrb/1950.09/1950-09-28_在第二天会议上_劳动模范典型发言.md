Xinhua News Agency, September 27th:

　　On the morning of the 26th, nine representatives gave typical speeches at the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. These nine model worker representatives, from different positions and with great contributions, are new types of figures who have emerged under the people's regime.

　　Li Yong
　　Li Yong, the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, is a 50-year-old veteran railway worker. He started working on the railway at the age of seventeen. Although he studied diligently, he spent a full twenty years as a driver in the old society and suffered countless times from the bullying and abuse of the Japanese. After Japan surrendered and the Northeast was liberated, his technical talents were discovered. Because he was alert and responsible, he had avoided locomotive accidents many times and became a well-known labor hero in the Northeast in 1946. Therefore, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, the national locomotive banner, was driven by the crew he led from the very beginning. Since he led the crew of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, it has safely traveled 182,400 kilometers. During this period, his crew, by accepting advanced experience from Soviet train operations, created new records in safe driving, increasing mileage, improving train management, and protecting the locomotive; and successively completed demonstration tasks at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot and Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot in the interior.

　　Zhao Guoyou
　　Zhao Guoyou, a 27-year-old young lathe worker, entered the factory as an apprentice at the age of fifteen. Less than a year after the liberation of Shenyang, he created the astonishing record of reducing the time for processing turret wheels from 24 hours to 50 minutes by using the "lathe and milling combination" method, becoming the leader of the vigorous new record creation movement in the Northeast. After visiting Soviet construction and attending the Second National People's Political Consultative Conference this year, his spirit of creation and research was greatly encouraged, and he created a new record for improving product quality.

　　Tian Guiying
　　The speech of female driver Tian Guiying illustrates how, under the leadership of the people's regime, women, who have always been the most disadvantaged in the old society, have mastered modern technology today. It took Li Yong twenty years to become a driver in the old society; it only took Tian Guiying eight or nine months to learn to drive a train. The different creation of people in two different societies is so disparate. With the patient education of Soviet experts and the encouragement and help of superiors, Tian Guiying finally became the first female driver in China.

　　Yang Fuchun
　　Yang Fuchun, chairman of the trade union of the Linkou Locomotive Depot in Northeast China, reported to the conference how he implemented the trade union's policy of facing production. Because he was able to consider the interests of the country everywhere and care for the workers, unite all the workers to implement the responsibility system, and launch the Iron Ox movement, the entire depot safely traveled 1,140,000 kilometers in the 288 days before April 15th this year. Among them, the "No. 1016" backbone Iron Ox locomotive even reached the national record of traveling 210,000 kilometers. From January to the end of August this year, the locomotives of the entire depot carried a total of more than 478,000 tons of excess load (exceeding the specified load), which is equivalent to the locomotives traveling 440 extra trips. Eighteen of the nineteen locomotives in the entire depot became "Iron Oxen." The Linkou Locomotive Depot has transformed from a damaged depot to a model depot.

　　Ding Zhihui
　　Ding Zhihui is an outstanding model female medical worker in the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, beloved by the wounded and sick. She joined the revolutionary ranks in 1939, and for twelve years she followed the troops in battles in East China, Northeast China, North China, and Central South China, actively and responsibly serving the wounded and sick in the intense combat life. In 1941, when the Japanese invaders swept through Yancheng in northern Jiangsu, the fighting was very intense, and she often disguised herself as a girl digging wild vegetables to treat the wounded. After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, she went north with the army, taking more than 400 wounded soldiers, and completed the safe transfer of the wounded after a long trek of 28 days in the wind and sand inside and outside the Great Wall, enduring all fatigue and hardship. In the battle to liberate Tianjin, she treated the wounded with a high degree of self-sacrifice, performing more than twenty operations in a row in one morning while ill. After the liberation of Tianjin, she led her subordinates to carry out a surprise treatment, curing more than 600 wounded and sick soldiers in one month.

　　Yu Songru
　　Yu Songru, an engineer in the Power Department of Tianjin Zhongfang No. 1 Factory, described his experience in improving production in his speech and talked about the process of his ideological transformation since liberation. Yu Songru's two major production contributions are improving boiler equipment to save coal and overhauling turbine engines. The former reduced the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of electricity in Zhongfang No. 1 Factory from the average minimum record of 1.202 kilograms since the factory was built to 0.632 kilograms. In total, from January to July this year, more than 2,600 tons of coal were saved, equivalent to about 600,000 jin of millet. This experience has now been promoted in Tianjin. In addition, after his research, the overhaul of the turbine engine was successful, which has extended the life of the machine and saved the country the expense of ordering from abroad, equivalent to more than 300,000 jin of millet.

　　Zhang Shibao
　　Zhang Shibao, a factory protection model of the Shanghai Electric Power Company who made special contributions in the anti-bombing struggle on February 6th this year, is a representative figure among the indomitable and tenacious fighting workers. After the US-Chiang bandit planes indiscriminately bombed Shanghai, in order to restore power supply for Shanghai and the light for six million people in the city, he united all the workers in the factory under the leadership of the trade union and carried out the work of repairing the power generation furnace in a tense manner. In the initial two days and one night of emergency repairs after the enemy bombing, he only slept for three hours, thus quickly enabling Shanghai's electricity to begin to recover partially.

　　Yang Liandi
　　Yang Liandi, the high-climbing hero of the Second Company of the First Regiment of the First Division of the Railway Corps, due to his bravery and resourcefulness, climbed to the 45-meter-high pier isolated in the Luo River when repairing the No. 8 Luo River Bridge, and carried out the blasting of dangerous work on the top of the pier. His spirit of not fearing sacrifice and his amazing deeds promoted the speed of progress of the entire on-site project, allowing the bridge to be completed twenty days ahead of schedule. It also saved the country 20,000 scaffolding poles, 5,000 jin of iron wire, and more than 400 man-days.

　　Hayin Jin
　　Hayin Jin, a model herdsman in Inner Mongolia with 40 or 50 years of herding experience, narrated with overflowing joy and excitement his transformation from decades of herding horses for the herdboss in the old society, while he himself always wore rags and ate sour and smelly food, to the "prosperity of both people and livestock" under the leadership of the Communist Party after liberation.

　　在第二天会议上
    劳动模范典型发言
    【新华社二十七日讯】二十六日上午，全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议上有九位代表作了典型发言。这九位岗位不同贡献很大的劳动模范代表，都是在人民政权下出现的新型人物。
  李永
    “毛泽东号”机车的司机长李永是一位五十岁的老铁路工人。十七岁起就在铁路做工，虽然他勤研苦学，但在旧社会作一个司机整整熬了二十年的时间，不知受了多少次日本人的欺侮虐待。日本投降、东北解放后，他的技术才能被发现了。因为他机警负责，曾多次地避免了机车事故，还在一九四六年便成为东北闻名的劳动英雄。也因此，全国机车旗帜的“毛泽东号”机车一开始就由他率领的包乘组驾驶了。从他领导包乘“毛泽东号”机车以来，已安全行车十八万二千四百公里。这期间，他所领导的包乘组因接受苏联乘务方面的先进经验，曾在安全行车、提高行车里程、改进乘务管理、保护机车等方面创造了新的纪录；并先后在关内丰台机务段、郑州机务段完成了示范任务。
  赵国有
    二十七岁的青年车工赵国有，十五岁就进工厂当学徒。沈阳解放后还不到一年时间，他便以“车铣结合”的工作方法，创造了车塔轮时间由二十四小时降到五十分钟的惊人纪录，成为东北轰轰烈烈的创造新纪录运动的带头者。今年参观苏联建设和出席二届全国人民政协会议以后，他的创造钻研精神更受到极大的鼓舞，又创造了提高产品质量的新纪录。
  田桂英
    女司机田桂英的发言，说明了在人民政权领导下，一向在旧社会中最没有地位的妇女今天如何掌握了现代技术。李永在旧社会二十年才熬成司机；田桂英学会开火车却只用了八九个月时间。两个不同社会对人的不同造就是如此悬殊。田桂英受到苏联专家的耐心教育、上级的鼓励帮助下，终于成了中国第一个女司机。
  杨福春
    东北林口机务段工会主席杨福春，向会议报告了他怎样执行了工会面向生产的方针。由于他能处处为国家利益打算并关心工人，团结全体工人贯彻实行负责制，展开了铁牛运动，使全段在今年四月十五日以前的二百八十八天中安全行走了一百一十四万公里。其中“一○一六号”基干铁牛机车更达到走行了二十一万公里的全国纪录。今年一月至八月底全段机车共超轴（超过规定载重量）四十七万八千多吨，等于机车多走了四百四十趟。全段十九台机车，有十八台成了“铁牛”。林口机务段从破损段变成了模范段。
  丁志辉
    丁志辉是中国人民解放军第四野战军中的一个为伤病员所爱戴的优秀模范女医务人员。一九三九年参加革命队伍，十二年来随部队转战华东、东北、华北和中南，一直在紧张的战斗生活中积极负责地为伤病员服务。在一九四一年日寇扫荡苏北盐城的时候，战斗十分紧张，她常常化装成挖野菜的姑娘，出去给伤员们治疗。抗日战争结束，她随军北上，带了四百多伤员，在长城内外的风沙中经过二十八天的长途跋涉，忍受一切疲劳艰险完成了安全转运伤员的任务。在解放天津的战役中，她以高度的自我牺牲精神带病治疗伤员，在一个上午一连开刀二十几次。天津解放后，她领导所属实行了一次突击治疗，在一个月内治愈六百多名伤病员。
  于松如
    天津中纺一厂原动部工程师于松如在发言中叙述了他改进生产的经验，并且谈到他解放以来思想转变的过程。于松如的两大生产贡献是改进锅炉设备节省用煤和检修透平机。前者使中纺一厂每度电耗煤量由建厂以来平均最低纪录的一点二○二公斤减到零点六三二公斤。总计从今年一月到七月，用煤节省了二千六百多吨，约合六十万斤小米。这一经验现已在天津推广。此外经他研究后检修透平机成功，已延长了机器寿命，为国家节省向国外定货的开支折合小米达三十余万斤。
  张世宝
    在今年二月六日反轰炸斗争中有特殊功勋的上海电力公司护厂模范张世宝，是不屈不挠顽强斗争的工人中的代表人物。在美蒋匪机滥炸上海以后，他为了恢复上海的动力用电和全市六百万人的光明，曾在工会的领导下，团结了全厂工人，紧张地进行修复发电炉的工作。在敌机轰炸后最初的两日一夜抢修中，他只睡了三小时，因而迅速地使上海的电力开始局部恢复。
  杨连弟
    铁道兵团第一师一团二连登高英雄杨连弟，由于他的英勇和机智，在抢修洛河八号桥时，登高到孤立在洛河之中的四十五公尺高的桥墩上，并在桥墩上进行了墩顶险工的爆破。由于他不怕牺牲的精神和惊人的事迹，推动了整个现场工程进展的速度，使该桥提前二十天完工。并为国家节省了两万根脚手杆子，五千斤铁丝和四百多人工。
  哈音金
    有着四五十年牧畜经历的内蒙古牧业劳动模范哈音金，以洋溢着的喜悦和兴奋叙述他从旧社会里给牧主放马数十年而自己却一直穿破烂、吃酸臭，到解放以后共产党领导下达到“人畜两旺”的转变。
