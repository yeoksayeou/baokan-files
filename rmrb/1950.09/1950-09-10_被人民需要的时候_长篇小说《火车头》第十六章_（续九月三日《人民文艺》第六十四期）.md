When Needed by the People
    —Chapter 16 of the Novel "Locomotive"
    (Continued from "People's Literature" No. 64, September 3rd)
    Cao Ming
    "We in the assembly shop are idle early. We can't cut the steel plates, we can't install the boiler, so we have no work to do. Yesterday, we just did some finishing work, making 'No. 27' look nicer," someone from the assembly shop answered Old Man Lin.

    A short guy from the turning section also said with a smile, "Will this month be like last month? Even without overtime this month, we can complete the task. Tianjin has been liberated, and Beijing will be soon. The People's Liberation Army is advancing so fast, our repaired locomotives can't keep up!"

    "That's right, Beijing might be taken before February 7th, and our 'No. 27' can be driven through the pass, to Zhengzhou! I heard the 'Beiping' locomotive of the locomotive depot is almost repaired."

    Director Xiao arranged everything and went back to the main building to find Director Liu.

    Li Xuewen had already led four people to get the boxes; Lin Zhongxiu looked at these people who were determined to help, and without hesitation, assigned each of them a task. After making the phone call, Old Liu popped his black face out of the boiler and called out with a smile:

    "Old Li's method is really good. Electric welding cuts threads as well as gas." As he spoke, he climbed down, ran to the prepared boiler plate, called two young men, and was about to start cutting.

    Old Man Lin saw him and shouted from afar, forbidding him:

    "Old Liu, wait for Li Xuewen to come back before you start. He said he needs to install a water tank, fearing the electric cylinder can't handle it. He's gone to find a water tank."

    "Go ahead, by the time he finds the water tank, my boiler plate will already be cut open." Old Liu put the iron plate in place, connected the gas line, clamped the carbon rod with the electric welding pliers, and put on his fireproof glasses.

    Old Man Lin was anxious and said loudly, "Old Liu, if you don't wait for him, who will be responsible if the electric cylinder burns out?"

    "I'm responsible, I guarantee it!" Old Liu simply didn't believe the electric cylinder couldn't handle it.

    "Okay, you're responsible. If you don't listen to my instructions, remember, don't blame me for criticizing you at the next democratic meeting," the old man said grumpily, running back and forth.

    Xiao Chen and two other young men had already run to Old Liu to help him hold the iron plate. Xiao Chen encouraged him from the side, "Do it, what's there to be afraid of!"

    He installed the live wire, the carbon rod lit up, and the purple light flashed and crackled. Red molten iron splattered everywhere, and a small opening was cut into the thick iron plate. Xiao Chen shouted loudly, "It's cut open, Foreman Lin, it's cut open, come and see."

    Old Man Lin turned from worry to joy and hurried over to see. People nearby dropped their work and ran to see. At this moment, Li Xuewen and several others happened to be carrying a heavy fire box in. He heard Xiao Chen's shout from afar, knowing that someone had already started. Anxiously, he put down the box and stepped forward, pushing the crowd away. He grabbed Old Liu with one hand, but before he could unplug the wire, the flame suddenly went out. Old Liu thought it was Li Xuewen's fault for pushing him, and hurriedly reconnected the wire, but it wouldn't light. The people working there also began to complain.

    "What's wrong, no power?"

    "The electric cylinder is burned out! Who told you to start?" Li Xuewen asked sternly.

    People stood there dejectedly. Xiao Chen hid behind Old Man Lin in fear. Old Man Lin knew he had caused trouble and shook his head. Old Liu saw that he had caused a mess, put down the electric welding pliers, took off his fireproof glasses, turned his face away, and looked regretfully at Li Xuewen's angry, triangular eyes.

    Li Xuewen looked at the iron plate with a two-inch-long opening, at the electric wires, carbon rods, and electric welding pliers scattered all over the ground in a mess. He felt annoyed in his heart and clenched his two copper-filled front teeth.

    Liu Guoliang and Xiao Ziying suddenly appeared. The joy and smile on Liu Guoliang's face frightened the people standing there as if they were attending a funeral. "What's going on?" he almost said to himself.

    As soon as people saw the director appear, their dejected expressions turned to panic, and they all lowered their heads.

    "What's going on?" he asked with a slightly stern tone.

    "The electric cylinder is burned out!" Old Man Lin raised his head and answered, not daring to look at him.

    "Do you know how much an electric cylinder costs?" Liu Guoliang looked at the lowered faces, remembering the cost of burning out an electric cylinder. Anxiously, he turned to Li Xuewen and said, "Master Li, didn't I specifically tell you to be careful with the electric cylinder? I didn't expect you to—"

    Xiao Ziying ran over to comfort everyone, saying, "It's okay, don't worry, the electric cylinder can be repaired. Let me go and see." His tone of voice was clearly inconsistent with Liu Director's stern tone. Because he knew that in such a situation, he could only encourage the workers to try again, and other methods would not be good. After he finished speaking, he went to check the electric cylinder and re-organize the work.

    Liu Liangchen took half a step forward with his right foot, hesitating to admit his mistake. Li Xuewen saw this, bravely raised his head, and said in a slow tone, preemptively, "It's my fault, Director! – I'll take responsibility for the electric cylinder, deduct it from my salary monthly."

    "Master Li, you don't have to take responsibility alone, we'll all share the responsibility." A dozen workers said one after another.

    "It's my fault for not leading well." Old Man Lin still wanted to say something, but stopped.

    Liu Liangchen was quietly shedding tears over there. Xiao Chen desperately gnawed at his fingernails. Hearing someone say everyone would share the responsibility, people felt lighter in their chests. Some sighed, some shifted their feet, and some peeked at Director Liu. Deputy Director Deng of the Riveting Factory stopped the people at the other end from complaining because they couldn't work without electricity, and tiptoed over, standing quietly behind Director Liu.

    Liu Guoliang began his long lecture, saying, "You don't understand the meaning of waste. Can't a large railway factory afford an electric cylinder, so you have to pay for it? That's not the point. Burning out an electric cylinder increases the cost of the locomotive, that's called waste. Moreover, the iron plate hasn't even been cut open yet? This is obviously not worth the loss… Didn't everyone know earlier that the electric cylinder couldn't handle it? Why did you still let the electric cylinder burn out? This electric cylinder doesn't belong to me, nor to any individual, it belongs to all the people in the country, so none of us has the right to burn it out. With the power outage, many people can't work, how much loss is that? Master Li is at fault, but I hope he can make up for his mistake by performing meritorious service, try again…"

    Dong Guixin from the Power Distribution Shop arrived at this time. After understanding what was going on, he secretly regretted being late: "It would have been good if I had come a quarter of an hour earlier." Seeing Director Liu's heartache over an electric cylinder, he was a little puzzled. He waited for Director Liu to finish speaking and suggested, "The motor team repaired two electric cylinders yesterday. I'll ask them to install them right away." Without waiting for others to speak, he turned and left to make a phone call.

    Hearing that the electric cylinder could be installed soon, everyone's chests felt lighter again. Li Xuewen was very anxious. If Director Liu's words continued, the new electric cylinder would be installed, but his water tank hadn't been made yet. Wouldn't that delay cutting the iron plate? Director Liu, fearing that the workers wouldn't understand, repeated the same words several times. Li Xuewen looked at the bundle of thick wires that Technician Dong had just brought, and at the water tank, his eyes widened with anxiety.

    Xiao Ziying came back and suggested to Director Liu that the workers should repair the water tank first so that they could test it as soon as the electric cylinder was installed. Liu Guoliang was afraid that the workers would not understand, and wanted to say more. But in the end, he accepted his opinion, ended his speech, and returned to the main building. As soon as he left, everyone breathed a sigh of relief and began to move nimbly. At this time, the propaganda committee member also led Fang Xiaohong over to comfort and encourage everyone to try again. Xiao Ziying joked with everyone and helped everyone wrap the wires. The atmosphere of fear and stalemate that had been here just now disappeared, as if nothing unpleasant had happened here. The people who had stopped working on the other side came over to help repair the water tank, while others helped install the electric cylinder. Before long, the electric cylinder was installed and the water tank was installed. People excitedly monitored this experiment.

    This time, Li Xuewen controlled the electric welding himself; Dong Guixin personally tested the voltage and directed people to add water and salt; Old Man Lin and Old Liu were worried and nervous, their faces covered in sweat. Xiao Ziying was cheering everyone up and comforting people. This temporary electrolytic cell increased the voltage, and the electric cylinder was safe and sound. People shouted, "The water is hot!" "There's not enough salt!" Dong Guixin's calm and confident expression comforted everyone. At this time, he gave people the guidance they needed. On this side, Li Xuewen bent down his tall body, lowered his big head wearing fireproof glasses, and the electric welding pliers were particularly steady in his broad, skilled palm. The same purple light, the same crackling sound, but the opening in the thick iron plate grew bigger and bigger. Although people couldn't see the expression in Li Xuewen's eyes, they could see that his mouth was wide open, sometimes pressing it into an oval shape, sometimes grinding his teeth. His right hand, raised to control the wire, maintained an astonishing stability, as if it were just resting there. The wise, patriotic blood flowed through the bulging veins on the back of this tense hand.

    This time, the young men were much calmer, holding their breath until the boiler plate was cut open before daring to speak.

    Li Xuewen straightened his back, pushed away the fireproof glasses with one hand, and wiped his sweat with the other. Director Xiao ran over, hugged his waist, and shook his pine-like body; Xiao Chen also took the opportunity to hug his master's leg. Fang Xiaohong happily shook hands with Li Xuewen and Dong Guixin. Everyone gathered around, using their eyes, words, and actions to congratulate and praise this riveter. Li Xuewen also smiled gratefully, smiled happily. His honest eyes widened foolishly, making him look even better. He began to understand: "Only when I am needed by the people can I have true happiness."

    Xiao Chen jealously said to his master intimately, "No wonder the old women all love him!"

    Old Man Lin couldn't bother to compliment his beloved nephew, and was busy telling people to bring the boiler plate to bake. Old Liu also worked happily and nimbly. Xiao Ziying shook his head and said, "You are a riveter, and I am also a riveter, but you are better than me. Workers really need to use their brains and improve their skills. In the field, technology determines everything! Everyone should learn from Master Li's example. Look how smoothly he cuts, the opening is much different from Master Liu's…."

    "How can you cut the opening smoothly?" Xiao Chen asked first.

    "This kid just loves to ask." Li Xuewen affectionately touched his apprentice's head, then faced everyone and said, "First, your hand must be steady, and second, you must be fast. When you usually work, after finishing the first pass, you should look around, compare, and think about where the problem is; the second pass will be smoother. After finishing the second pass, you still have to look and compare; the third time you'll get it. After you're skilled, you might as well think about how to save time and materials…"

    "That's right, it would be good if every worker could learn from your example and use their brains. Actually, this technology stuff gets more interesting the more you do it. It's only meaningful to create something new and succeed!" As soon as Director Xiao mentioned working, he forgot that he was the director of the branch factory.

    "Electric welding to cut iron plates is not really a new trick. People have used it a long time ago," Li Xuewen explained.

    "That water tank can be considered an invention!" Lin Zhongxiu shouted like a witness. Then he reminded everyone: "We still have to cut iron plates and pipes. Don't put down the work and chat. If 'No. 27' doesn't come out, the invention is useless!"

    Hearing this, everyone laughed and immediately got to work, returning to their posts. Xiao Ziying ran to Dong Guixin, who was still single-mindedly tidying up the water tank, and held out his hand to him. The technician was concentrating on fiddling with the water tank, looked up at Director Xiao, and then lowered his head again. Xiao Ziying softly requested:

    "Let's shake hands, comrade. This time, you helped everyone a lot. To repeat an old saying: workers should cooperate and bring out their talents!"

    Technician Dong shook hands with Director Xiao, feeling a little embarrassed to hear the other party praising him, and didn't say anything. After a while, he raised his head and said in a casual tone, like talking to a familiar person, "I like to play with new things. I've already modified a few small tools in the power plant, but I'm afraid the higher-ups won't agree, so I haven't taken them out to use. In the future, if the riveting factory has any difficulties and needs help from the power plant, please tell me and let me think of a way to try."

    "You should take out the tools you've modified and try them out. What are they? I don't understand electricity much…"

    The two of them were talking enthusiastically, and people from the turning and assembly shops came one after another to see the iron plate cut open by electric welding, to see the water tank, making the scene very lively. Old Man Lin, Technician Dong, and Xiao Ziying, imperceptibly, became explainers, explaining to everyone how electric welding could cut open iron plates and why a water tank was needed.

    Li Xuede also ran over, squeezed through the crowd, and watched his younger brother cutting the iron plate with his muffled energy. He worried when he looked at the cold, hard, and thick iron plate; but where the light reached, the iron plate slowly cracked open, and the opening grew deeper and deeper. Once cut open, the two pieces of iron plate, separated from the whole, fell heavily to the ground. Li Xuede's heart was also happy and excited, as if it was about to split in half. The heavy sorrow he had felt for the past two days suddenly fell to the ground. He experienced this kind of surprising happiness for the first time. - No, when his wife was about to give birth for the first time, he was frightened by his wife's painful cries. He thought she would die: but then, after the baby's cry, as if reporting to mankind, ended her painful groans. Not only did she not die, but she brought a new life. His sorrow immediately turned to joy. - The joy of that time and the joy of today both had an indescribable taste. He saw his younger brother stand up and wipe his sweat, and he wondered why his younger brother was particularly tall and his face was particularly cute today. Usually, he thought he was clumsy and unsightly; but now he was so kind and smart. He stood in front of his younger brother, tapping his own head, and said, "Third brother, my head is like that hard iron plate, but you are that spark, you melted my head. From now on, I won't object to you experimenting with this and inventing that. Everyone, look, inventing something is better than working ten and a half days of overtime! Without you, how could the boiler plate be cut open? 'No. 27' wouldn't be able to get out!"

    Li Xuewen looked down and saw that it was his eldest brother. He was embarrassed, turned his face away, suppressed the joy in his heart, pushed his eldest brother away with his hand, and said jokingly:

    "I'm not a spark, my sister-in-law is the spark!"

    A roar of laughter echoed through a corner of the riveting branch factory.

    Since electric welding replaced oxygen to cut open iron plates, the morale of the workers in the factory has generally been high. Many staff members and technicians have also changed their views on the workers and have automatically become close to them. When there is a shortage of materials or any difficulty, the branch director and technicians also come to ask the workers.

    Li Xuewen has also been busy since that day. Director Xiao asked him and Technician Dong to summarize this experience; the union asked him to tell the entire factory about the motivation and process of electric welding to cut iron plates; and newspaper reporters came to interview him. Workers from various branch factories who wanted to create something and encountered difficulties also came to ask him. Sister-in-law Li also promoted him everywhere to her neighbors; therefore, when he returned home, he was often asked questions by the old men and old women. He suddenly became a famous person in the Majiawan Railway Factory.

    Li Xuewen himself was very surprised by this change. He felt that nothing had changed, his head was still the same size, his hands were still the same rough, what exactly had he added to his body? Why were people suddenly different towards him? He didn't understand at all. On the contrary, since that day, he felt that the difficulties were increasing. He was originally not good at speaking, but he was forced to go on stage to talk about his experience in overcoming difficulties. He spoke once and his voice was weak for three days and three nights. When workers from various branch factories came to ask him about technical difficulties, he was ashamed. He understood a little about electric welding and boilers; but what did he know about other crafts?

    But he did begin to understand: "Solving difficulties for everyone is what makes life meaningful and brings joy and comfort. But the more everyone needs me, the more I feel that my brain is not enough!"

    Dan Zhi originally planned to raise the price of the oxygen that his cousin had hoarded to make a good profit; this time, his fantasy failed. At this time, the whole factory was happy, and he alone was frustrated. He gradually felt that his frustration was shameful.

    Lu Maolin was very happy to see that others had succeeded in cutting iron plates with electric welding, and he was more confident in his plan to transform iron molds. After thinking for three nights in a row, his mind became clear. He drilled many small holes in the iron mold, and then inserted small iron rods of the same thickness into each small hole, allowing the gaps naturally formed between the small iron rods and the round holes to exhaust the gas. As a result of the experiment, the copper tile had no sand holes. Since then, the scrap rate of copper tiles has been reduced from 35% to 7%.

    Old Man Han of the turning shop, seeing that others had made contributions, could not accept it, and also stayed up all night to find a way to transform a spring-making machine, which was ten times faster than the semi-manual one. He and Liu Jingkuan and Shen Hong also transformed a chopping machine and a slide machine for making steel knives.

    Not only could "No. 27" be rolled out and ignited according to the original plan; but also temporary substitutes for overcoming difficulties, improvements to machinery to increase production, and donations of equipment appeared one after another like bamboo shoots after a rain. The plan for January was completed one day ahead of schedule.

　　被人民需要的时候
    ——长篇小说《火车头》第十六章
    （续九月三日《人民文艺》第六十四期）
    草明
    “咱们装车的早闲着啦，铁板割不下来，锅炉安不上，咱没活干啦。咱们昨天一天就做加工活，把‘二七号’弄得漂亮些。”装车分厂有人回答老林头。
    旋盘的一个矮个也笑着说：“本月份还同上月么？这个月不加夜班也就能完成任务。天津解放了，北京也快了。人家解放军前进得多快，咱修的火车头赶不上啊！”
    “可不是，二月七号以前说不定北京已拿下，咱们的‘二七号’可以开进关，开到郑州去！听说机务段的‘北平号’已经修得不大离了。”
    萧主任布置好一切，便回大楼去找刘厂长去了。
    李学文早已领着四个人去取箱子；林忠秀看着这一些决心来帮忙的人，也就不客气，每人都分配他一样工作。自己打完电话回来，老柳一脸黑呼呼的从锅炉里探出头来，笑嘻嘻地叫道：
    “老李的办法真行，电焊割丝扣，和瓦斯一样好使。”他说着，爬了下来，跑到人家准备好的锅炉板跟前，招呼了两个小伙，动手就要割。
    老林头瞅见了远远嚷着，禁止他说：
    “老柳，等李学文回来再动手。他说还要装只水箱，怕电缸抗不了，他找水箱去啦。——”
    “去吧，等他找水箱回来，我的锅炉板已割开啦。”老柳把铁板放好，瓦斯线按上，电焊钳子夹好了炭棒，戴上防火镜子。
    老林头一急，大声说：“老柳，你不等他，电缸烧坏了，谁负责？”
    “我负责，我包！”老柳根本不相信电缸会抗不住。
    “好，你负责，你不听我的摆弄，记住，下一次开民主会你不要怪我批评你。”老头气嘟嘟地说。两头跑来跑去。
    小陈和另外两个小伙早就跑到老柳跟前，帮他扶铁板，小陈在旁边怂恿了一句：“干吧，怕什么！”
    安上火线，炭棒点着了，紫色的火光闪亮着、嗤呀嗤呀地响着，红色的铁水四面飞溅着，厚厚的铁板割开了个小口，小陈就大声叫道：“割开啦，林班长，割开啦，快来看。”
    老林头转忧为喜，赶着跑去看，附近有人撇下自己的活跑去看。这时李学文几个人正好抬着沉重的消防箱进来。他老远就听见小陈的嚷叫，晓得有人已经动手；他一急，赶忙撂下箱子，上前推开众人，一手抓住老柳，还来不及拔他的天线，火焰突然灭了。老柳当是李学文推他之过，急忙再把天线接上，点不着了。那边干活的人也嚷开了。
    “怎么啦，没电？”
    “电缸烧坏了！是谁叫动手的？”李学文严厉地问。
    人们立刻颓丧地站着，小陈害怕得躲在老林头背后，老林头知道闯了祸，摇了摇头。老柳看见自己闹了乱子，撂下电焊钳子，摘下防火镜子，转过脸来，后悔地望着李学文那双生气的、压成三角形的眼睛。
    李学文看着那块张开了二寸来长口的铁板，看着狼狈地撂满一地的电线、炭棒、电焊钳子；心中烦恼起来了；咬紧了两颗铜镶的门牙。
    刘国梁和萧子英突然出现了，刘国梁脸上的高兴和笑容，给送葬似地站着的人们吓回去了。“这是怎么回事？”他几乎是自言自语。
    人们一看见厂长出现，颓丧的脸色再加上惊慌，都把头低下来。
    “什么回事。”他略带严厉地问。
    “电缸烧坏了！”老林头抬起头来回答，不敢望他。
    “一个电缸值多少钱，你们知道吗？”刘国梁望了望那些俯低的脸，想起了烧毁一只电缸，心里一急，转向李学文说：“李师傅，我不是特别嘱咐你当心电缸的么？没想到你这回没立下功劳就——”
    萧子英跑过来，安慰大家说：“没事，不要紧，电缸好修，等我去看。”他和刘厂长的严厉的口气显然不协调。因为他知道在这样的时候，对工友只能鼓励他们再试，别的办法都是不好的。他说完，便又马上去看电缸和重新布置工作去了。
    柳亮臣右脚上前半步，迟疑地想开口承认自己的错误；李学文看见，勇敢地抬起了头，用缓慢的调子抢先说：“我错啦，厂长！——电缸我包了它，按月扣我的开支吧。”
    “李师傅，不用你一个人来包，我们大家伙来包。”十来个工友争先恐后地说。
    “是我领导的不好。”老林头还想说什么，可又停住了。
    柳亮臣在那边悄悄的流眼泪。小陈拚命啃自己的手指甲。听谁说了大家伙来包。人们觉得胸口轻快了些。有吁吁气的、有换换脚的、也有抬头偷眼望刘厂长的。铆工厂的邓副主任禁止住那一头因没电不能干活的人吵嚷、便蹑手蹑脚地走过来，悄悄站到刘厂长背后。
    刘国梁开始了他长长的教导说：“浪费的意思，你们还不明白。一个电缸，这大一个铁路工厂出不起，要你们来包？不是的。烧坏一个电缸、这机车的成本就增加了，这就叫浪费。何况铁板还没割开？这显然得不偿失。……大家不是早知道电缸抗不住么？为什么还让电缸烧坏？这个电缸不是我的，也不是那一个个人的，是属于全国人民的，因此我们谁也没有权力烧坏他。停了电，许多人不能干活，这又损失多少？李师傅是有过失的，但是我希望他带罪立功，再试验……”
    动力分厂的董桂新这时赶到了，听明白是什么一回事，他暗地里后悔自己来迟了：“我早来一刻钟就好。”他看见刘厂长那么心痛一只电缸，心里有点不明白。他等刘厂长说的差不多，便提议说：“昨天电机班修好了两个电缸，我去叫他们马上来装。”他没有等别人说话，转身就走去挂电话去了。
    听说马上能装好电缸，大家的胸口又轻快了一些。李学文心里很焦急，如果刘厂长的话还要说下去，人家新的电缸已装上了，他的水箱还没弄好，岂不耽误了割铁板？刘厂长呢，生怕工友们听不明白，把话翻来复去说好几遍，李学文望着刚才董技术员送来的那捆粗线，望着那个水箱，急的直瞪眼。
    萧子英回来了，向刘厂长建议先让工人们去修水箱，好等电缸一装上就能试验。刘国梁生怕工友听不明白，还想再说。但是他到底接受了他的意见，把讲话结束，回大楼去了。他一走，大家松了一口大气，便都灵活地动起手来。这时宣传委员也领着方晓红跑过来，安慰大家，鼓励大家再试验。萧子英戏谑地和大家说着笑话，也动手帮大家缠电线。刚才这里的那种害怕的僵持的空气，不晓得跑哪儿去了，好像这里并没有发生过什么不愉快的事似的。那边停了工的人们，有一部分过来帮忙修水箱，另一部分帮忙按电缸。不一会工夫，电缸按上了，水箱已装好了。人们兴奋地监视着这一回的试验。
    这一回李学文自己掌握电焊；董桂新亲自试电压、指挥人们添水加盐；老林头和老柳操心和紧张得一脸是汗。萧子英在给大家打气，安慰人心。这只临时的电解槽使电压增加，电缸安全无恙。人们嚷着“水热啦！”“盐少啦！”董桂新的沉着而自信的脸色安慰了大家。在这时候他给人们以应有的指点。这边李学文弯下高大的身子，俯低了戴上防火镜的大脑瓜，电焊钳子在他那宽阔熟练的手掌里特别平稳。一样紫色的火光，一样的嗤呀嗤呀的音响，厚铁板裂开的口子却越来越大了。人们虽然看不见李学文眼睛的表情，但是看见他的嘴巴张得很大，有时把它压成扁圆形，有时两排牙齿磨着。他那举起控制把线的右手，保持着十分惊人的稳定，好像它在那儿不过平平地放着似的。智慧的，热爱祖国的血液，就在这紧张的手背上的突起的血管里流过。
    这一回小伙们也冷静多了，敛住了呼吸，一直到锅炉板割开，才敢说话。
    李学文伸直了腰，一手推开防火镜，一手擦着汗，萧主任跑过来，当腰抱着了他，摇撼着他那松树似的身子；小陈也过去乘机抱着师傅的腿。方晓红快活地和李学文与董桂新握了手。大家围拢过来，用眼光，用语言，用动作来对这个铆工表示庆贺和称赞。李学文也感激地笑了，愉快地笑了。他那敦厚的眼睛傻里傻气地瞪大，更觉好看了。他开始理解：“自己被人民所需要的时候，才产生真正的快乐。”
    小陈亲昵地嫉妒着他师傅：“怪不得老娘们都爱他！”
    老林头顾不上来恭维他的心爱的侄儿，忙着叫人端锅炉板去烤，老柳也快活地敏捷地工作。萧子英摇头摆脑地说：“你是铆工，我也是铆工，你比我行啦。工人真要开动脑瓜，提高技术，在现场，技术决定一切！大家都应该学李师傅的好样。你瞅他割的特别平，比柳师傅割的口子不同多啦。……”
    “怎样才能叫割口割的平？”小陈抢先问。
    “这小子就爱问。”李学文宠爱地摸了摸徒弟的头、然后面对着大家说：“第一手要稳，第二就要快。平常干活，干完头一遍之后就要到处瞅瞅，比比，想想毛病在那儿；第二遍就顺手一些。干完了第二遍还得瞅，比；第三回就得手了。手熟以后，就不妨寻思寻思，换个样儿，怎样干才能更节省时间，更节省材料……”
    “对啦，每个工友都能学你的样子，都花花脑子就好。其实，技术这玩艺儿，越干越有味儿，创造个花样，成功啦，才有意思啊！”萧主任一提起干活，就忘了自己是分厂的主任。
    “电焊割铁板，其实不算新花样，在早就有人用过。”李学文解释说。
    “那只水箱，可算得发明啦！”林忠秀像证人似地叫道。随后他提醒大家：“还得割铁板、割管子啦，别把活撂下唠嗑，‘二七号’出不来，发明了也白搭啊！”
    大家一听，笑着，立刻动作起来，回到岗位又干开了。萧子英跑到那位还在一心一意拾掇水箱的董桂新跟前，向他伸出手来。技术员正在专心摆弄水箱，抬头看了看萧主任，又俯下头去。萧子英又柔声柔气地请求他说：
    “让我们来握握手吧，同志。这一回你对大家的帮忙不小啦。又是老话一句：职工应该合作，发挥天才啊！”
    董技术员和萧主任握了手，听对方称赞自己，觉得有点不好意思，不吱声。过了一会，他抬起头来，用和熟人说话一样随便的口气说道：“我爱弄新玩艺儿，在动力厂我已经改造了几样小工具，怕上头不同意，还没拿出来使唤。以后铆工厂有什么困难需要动力厂帮忙的，请告诉我一声，让我想想办法试试看。”
    “你改造的工具该拿出来试一试啊。是什么玩艺儿？电气我可不大明白……”
    他们俩个正谈的津津有味，旋盘和装车厂陆续有人来看被电焊割开的铁板，看水箱，把现场挤的好热闹。老林头、董技术员和萧子英，无形中就变成了说明人，对大家说明电焊怎样能割开铁板，为什么要加一只水箱。
    李学德也跑了过来，挤开了大家，挨到弟弟跟前看着他用闷劲割铁板的样儿。他瞅着那块冷冰冰的又硬又厚的铁板就操心；但是火光所到的地方，铁板缓缓儿裂开了口，口儿越张越深了，割开了，从整体里分裂开来的两块铁板沉重地掉地了。李学德的心儿也高兴和兴奋得快要裂开了两半似地。他这两天的沉重的忧愁，忽然掉地了，像这样惊奇式的快乐，他第一次体验到。——不，当他的妻子第一次临产时，他被妻的痛苦的呼喊吓坏了，他以为她会死的：但是，后来，儿子那向人类报到似的哭啼响叫以后，她的痛苦的呻吟也结束了。她不特没有死，——并且带来了一个新生命。他的忧愁立刻变成了快乐。——那一次的快乐，和今天的快乐都有点说不出来的味道。他看见弟弟一面站起来一面擦汗，他奇怪着弟弟今天为什么特别高、面孔也特别可爱。平常他觉得他愣头愣脑、不顺眼的时候多；现在却是这么和气、聪明。他站到弟弟跟前，敲着自己的脑瓜说：“老三，我这个脑瓜好比那块硬铁板，你却是那一朵火核，你把我的脑瓜化开啦。今后我不反对你试验这个，发明那个了。大伙瞅瞅，发明一样东西，比咱们加十天半月的夜班还强呀！没有你，锅炉板怎能割开？‘二七号’准出不去呀。”
    李学文低头一看，是他大哥，他不好意思，避开了脸，压抑着心中的高兴，用手推开他大哥，戏谑地说：
    “我不是火核，大嫂子才是火核！”
    哄堂的大笑响遍了铆工分厂的一角。
    自从电焊代替氧气割开铁板以后，现厂里工友们情绪普遍高涨了，许多职员和技术人员对工人也改变看法，自动和他们亲密起来，遇到缺乏器材或什么困难时，分厂主任和技术员也来问问工人们。
    李学文从这一天起也忙了起来。萧主任叫他和董技术员总结这一次的经验；工会里请他向全厂讲述电焊割铁板的动机和经过；新闻记者来访问。各个分厂的工人有人想创造一样东西，遇到困难时，也来问问他。李大嫂还在邻居前替他到处宣传；因此他回到家常被那些老头老太太问长问短。他突然成为马家湾铁路工厂的一个有名的人物了。
    李学文自己很惊异这样的改变。他觉得自己什么也没有变动，脑瓜还是一样大，手还是一样粗，究竟身上增加了一些什么呢？为什么人们对他突然不同了呢？他完全不明白。相反的自从那一天起，他感到困难越来越多了。本来不会说话的，硬叫上讲台讲他克服困难的经验。他讲了一次话嗓子三天三夜都不带劲。各分厂的工友来问到他技术上的困难时，他才惭愧的不成；电焊呀，锅炉呀，他还明白点；别的手艺，他那里懂得？
    但是他的确开始理解：“要替大伙解决困难，人才活的有意思，才得到快乐和安慰。可是，大伙越是需要自己，就越觉得脑瓜不够用！”
    单志本来打算把他老表囤起来的氧气抬高价钱，好好挣一笔钱；这一来，他的幻想失败了。这时全场都高高兴兴，独他一个人懊丧，他渐渐觉得自己的懊丧是可耻的。
    路茂林看见人家拿电焊割铁板成功，满心高兴，他的改造铁型计划就更有信心了。一连想了三个晚上，他脑筋开朗了，将铁模钻上许多小孔，每个小孔上又塞上同样粗细的小铁棍，让小铁棍和圆孔之间自然形成的缝隙去排除气体。试验的结果，铜瓦没有砂眼了。此后，铜瓦废活从百分之三十五减至百分之七。
    旋盘厂的老韩头看见人家立了功，那能服气，也漏夜想办法改造了一台制弹簧的机器，比半手工制的快十倍。他又和刘景宽、沈洪二人改制出一台剁锉机和一台制钢刀用的滑道机。
    不仅“二七号”能按原定计划落车、点火；一时发明代用品来克服困难的，和改良机械提高产量的、献器材的，像雨后的春笋一样，一桩接一桩出现。一月份的计划，提早一天完成了。
