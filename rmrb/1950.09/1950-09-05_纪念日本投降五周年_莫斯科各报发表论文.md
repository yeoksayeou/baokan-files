Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 4th: According to TASS, Moscow newspapers published lengthy articles on the 3rd to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Japan's unconditional surrender. The articles unanimously pointed out the decisive role played by the Soviet Armed Forces in destroying the Japanese war machine, and the Soviet Union's unwavering desire to quickly resolve the post-war Far East issues on a democratic basis.

Vasiliev wrote in Pravda: The Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward concrete proposals for the quickest possible conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. However, the US government has rejected these proposals, stubbornly undermining the conclusion of a peace treaty based on the Potsdam Declaration. The American occupiers are trying to impose a separate "peace treaty" on the Japanese people, a treaty no different from the occupation regulations in West Germany. The author pointed out: American imperialists, who want to make Japan a base for aggression in the Far East, are, with the help of the traitorous Yoshida clique, doing their best to stifle the democratic movement of the Japanese people in order to secure their "rear" in Japan. The American aggression against Korea and Taiwan, the bandit-like air raids on Chinese towns, and the assistance provided by the British and French aggressors to the aggressive war, all demonstrate that the American imperialists are even more unscrupulously suppressing the people of Asia than the Japanese samurai. However, the author continued: Truman and MacArthur's aggressive plans are doomed to fail. The powerful peace front is growing stronger day by day, and freedom-loving people are full of determination to thwart the war-mongers' evil plans.

The Izvestia and Red Star newspapers published articles by Markov and Major General Sapozhnikov, respectively. Markov denounced the American occupiers for violating the Potsdam Declaration and doing their best to remilitarize Japan and turn Japan into an American military base.

　　纪念日本投降五周年
    莫斯科各报发表论文
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科各报三日为纪念日本无条件投降五周年，发表了长篇论文。论文一致指出苏维埃武装部队在摧毁日本战争机器中所起的决定性的作用，以及苏联在民主的基础上迅速解决战后远东问题的不变的愿望。
    瓦西里耶夫在真理报上写道：苏联曾不止一次地为最迅速地缔结对日和约提出了具体的建议。但是，美国政府拒绝了这些建议，顽固地破坏在波茨坦宣言的基础上缔结和约。美国占领者力图把单独“和约”强加在日本人民身上，这种和约与西德的占领法规毫无二致。作者指出：想使日本成为侵略远东的基地的美国帝国主义者，在卖国的吉田集团帮助下，竭力扼杀日本人民的民主运动，以便保障他们在日本的“后方”。美国侵略朝鲜和台湾，强盗式地空袭中国城镇，以及英法侵略者对侵略战争所提供的援助，都说明美帝国主义者是比日本武士还要无法无天地镇压亚洲人民的宪兵。但是，作者继称：杜鲁门与麦克阿瑟的侵略计划是注定要失败的。强大的和平阵线正在一天比一天加强，爱好自由的人民充满着挫败战争贩子们的罪恶计划的决心。
    消息报和红星报分别刊载马可夫和萨波日尼科夫少将的论文。马可夫斥责美国占领者破坏波茨坦宣言并竭力重使日本军国主义化和变日本为美国军事基地。
