　　On the Current Exchange Rate Issue

　　Since the implementation of the decision on unified financial and economic work nationwide, domestic finance and prices have gradually stabilized, and new developments have emerged in exchange rates.

　　Since April of this year, the adjustment of exchange rates has reversed the upward trend of the past and formed a downward trend; the US dollar exchange rate has fallen from a high of 42,000 yuan in early April to the current 32,200 yuan. Before June, people understood that this change was due to the decline in domestic prices, but after June, domestic prices have generally stabilized, but exchange rates have continued to decline, so some people have questioned, what is the basis for determining exchange rates? Is the current exchange rate too low? Is the magnitude of the exchange rate reduction too large?

　　To answer these questions, we believe that the basis for determining exchange rates should first be clarified in order to obtain the correct answers.

　　Generally speaking, the exchange rate is a reflection of the purchasing power of the currencies of two countries; specifically, the change in the exchange rate depends on several factors: domestic general prices, import and export prices, and foreign prices. Because these factors can directly reflect the changes in the internal and external purchasing power of the currencies of the two countries, which can be fully explained in the process of exchange rate changes.

　　Before April of this year, exchange rates were frequently adjusted upwards, which not only indicated the government's policy of encouraging exports and facilitating overseas remittances, but also adapted to the unstable domestic prices at that time. Therefore, exchange rates always followed domestic general prices and export prices, making upward adjustments.

　　After April, the listed price adjustments began to show a downward trend:

　　During the period from April to June, the decline in exchange rates was mainly due to the steady decline in domestic general prices and export prices. However, the decline in exchange rates was not as large as the decline in prices, thus showing that exchange rates were too high. For example, in Tianjin, the average general price in April, May, and June fell by 20% compared with March, and export prices fell by 6%, while exchange rates fell by only 5.7%. Here, we must particularly point out that although the decline in exchange rates was much smaller than the decline in general prices, the decline in export prices was similar to the decline in exchange rates. The reason is that export prices followed exchange rates during this period, instead of falling in line with general prices. Although this shows the government's support for exports, there are still aspects worth studying from the overall perspective.

　　After the US imperialists directly instigated the Li Chengwan bandit gang to launch the war of aggression against Korea on June 25, US prices rose across the board. According to Xinhua News Agency reports, they rose by 16.72% within one month after the war of aggression against Korea was launched. According to the Moody Index, if April is taken as 100, US prices rose by 25.7% by early August. Although the degree of price increase in the UK was more moderate, it also rose by 11.3% during the same period. This fully shows the degree of devaluation of the currencies of the US and British imperialist countries.

　　The devaluation of the currencies and the rise in prices of the US and British imperialist countries are the result of their new war adventures. After the US imperialists passed the 1950 fiscal expenditure budget of US$42.948 billion on July 8, Truman successively proposed six additional appropriations totaling US$17.261869729 billion. The total of the two is US$60.209869729 billion, while the revenue budget and the income from increased taxes are only about US$42 billion, with a deficit of more than US$18.2 billion, which is nearly 30% of the total expenditure. The method of making up for this is only to issue more currency or exploit the people in other ways. It is estimated that one month after launching the war of aggression, the US imperialist government's debt increased by US$1,025,940,214.96, and gold assets decreased by US$94,457,693.92, while the amount of US dollar circulation increased by more than 130 million yuan from June 21 to August 3. This shows that the war of aggression launched by the US imperialists has brought profound disasters to the American people; on the other hand, it also shows the internal crisis of the imperialist economy. The situation in the British Empire is also the same. Amid the sound of military expansion and war preparations, it issued 50 million pounds of bonds on June 27 as preparation for increasing currency issuance, and on August 3, under the pressure of the US imperialists, it announced a three-year military expansion plan with a cost of 3.4 billion pounds. The number of pounds in circulation also increased by about 40 million pounds from June 21 to August 3. All of this shows that the degree of currency devaluation in imperialist countries will become more and more serious.

　　Looking back at the US dollar exchange rate in our country, it fell by a total of 24.2% from April to early August. That is to say, the decline in our country's exchange rate is even lower than the rate of increase in US prices (25.7%), while during the same period, our country's prices, taking Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou as examples, also decreased by 5.1%. Therefore, during this period, our exchange rate must be adjusted in a timely manner, otherwise our domestic prices will be raised by the impact of rising US prices, that is to say, the RMB will depreciate along with the devaluation of the US dollar.

　　Therefore, if the rise or fall of exchange rates in the previous stage was mainly due to the rise or fall of domestic prices, then the downward adjustment of exchange rates at present is undoubtedly mainly due to the new factor of rising foreign prices.

　　The following facts can illustrate whether the current exchange rate is too low or too high.

　　First, from the export perspective:

　　From the conversion rate of goods and exchange rates: In January and February of this year, one US dollar was converted into millet, except for a period of price fluctuations during the Spring Festival, which was as low as 16-18 jin, it was often around 25-26 jin; since April, it has always been equivalent to more than 30 jin. Looking at the real exchange rate in various places, before April, one US dollar was equivalent to 5-6 units in Tianjin and 4-5 units in Shanghai, respectively; and since April, until now, it has been equivalent to 7 units and 6 units or more, respectively. According to the past experience of exporters, it is profitable if one US dollar can be equivalent to 28 jin of millet or 6 real units. As of the exchange rate change on August 7, in Tianjin, it was equivalent to 6 and a half real units and more than 35 jin of millet, which shows that the current exchange rate can still take care of exports. Naturally, taking care of exports does not mean that every export item can be profitable. This is not a problem that can be solved by exchange rates alone, and other methods can be used to compensate. As for the price changes of certain export goods abroad, which are not completely consistent with the general price changes abroad, this is also a fact. However, the state must not, in order to take care of these goods, shift the loss of foreign currency devaluation onto the shoulders of the general Chinese people.

　　Looking at it from the import perspective:

　　In the past, exchange rates generally took more care of exports, so exchange rates were often too high, which was in line with the situation at the time in encouraging the export of foreign sales materials and striving for foreign exchange. However, since the stabilization of prices, in coordination with domestic economic construction, appropriate care should also be given to imports. Before May of this year, due to the stagnant state of industry and commerce, there were very few sales channels for imported goods, and the prices of imported goods fell behind the prices of exported goods. Since the liberation of Zhoushan and the basic elimination of the maritime blockade, industry and commerce generally improved in June, and the demand for industrial equipment increased. Import prices rebounded in early June. From late June to the end of July, after the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, the international commodity market set off a price increase, which affected the further rise in import prices in the three ports of Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. During this period, import price indices successively exceeded export price indices. Taking the average import and export indices in early August as an example, Tianjin was 200.07 and 182.38 respectively, Shanghai was 196.83 and 187.65 respectively, and Guangzhou (August 10) was 128.79 and 89.55 respectively (base period: April 1-20 of this year). During this period, exchange rates were adjusted downwards all the way, and importers already had considerable profits, especially since the exchange rate was adjusted on August 7, the import profit has increased significantly. However, it should be noted that this situation cannot last without continuing to seek coordination from exchange rates, because looking only at the prices of several major imported goods in the Hong Kong market, if late June is set to 100, the average prices in the upper, middle, and lower ten days of July are 106, 128, and 136 respectively, reaching 152 at the end of July, while the domestic import price index has not exceeded 30% since late June. At present, the prices in the international market still have a tendency to continue to rise, and the US imperialists are using the excuse of "strategic materials" to block me, and are also forcing the British Empire to restrict exports to me in Hong Kong, all of which are factors that increase my import costs. If we do not take care of it in terms of exchange rates, the profits of imports will inevitably decrease, and the supply of imported goods will also be affected. Therefore, in the future, imports will have the same importance as exports, and we must take into account both imports and exports in order to be in line with the domestic and international situation.

　　Finally, from the perspective of overseas remittances:

　　The current exchange rate can take care of the purchasing power of overseas remittances. This can be proved by the following facts:

　　First, since domestic prices have stabilized, the black market price of foreign currencies has often revolved around the exchange rate, changing with a very small range. According to recent reports, the black market of foreign currencies in various parts of South China has fallen below the exchange rate, and there is a tendency to continue to decline.

　　Second, compare the actual living expenses and commodity prices at home and abroad: According to the "Far Eastern Economic Review" published on July 27, a family of five in Guangzhou needs 500,000 yuan per month for three meals a day (superior white rice and dishes), which is equivalent to 96 Hong Kong dollars, which can only buy one dan of white rice in Hong Kong.

　　Let’s compare the prices of real objects. On July 20, Hong Kong rice was 65 cents per catty in Hong Kong dollars, which is equivalent to 3 jin and 2 taels of rice in Guangzhou and 1 jin and 11 taels in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou at the exchange rate of the day. On the same day, pork in Hong Kong was 3 yuan and 95 cents, but it could be bought for about 2 jin in Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou.

　　From the above, it can be seen that the current exchange rate not only takes care of imports and exports, but also facilitates overseas remittances. Judging from the stable value of the RMB and the continuous devaluation of currencies caused by the imperialist countries launching wars, the flexible adjustment of the current exchange rate is very necessary. As for the magnitude of exchange rate changes, it should of course take care of import and export trade, but it is basically determined by the magnitude of changes in the financial prices of the two countries. Taking care of import and export trade can be more practical by starting with the timing of foreign exchange settlement, just like the past deferred foreign exchange settlement of the Bank of China and the current pre-settlement of foreign exchange. For the care of overseas remittances, other methods can be adopted in individual areas to ensure the lives of overseas relatives. It is naturally difficult to ask for the solution of all problems with exchange rates.

　　In short, a high exchange rate promotes exports but restricts imports; a low exchange rate encourages imports but affects exports, and it also involves the issue of overseas remittances. Our exchange rate work is to seek a general unity among these three, so everyone should deeply recognize that: partial interests should obey overall interests, and partial difficulties can be overcome by partial methods.

　　关于目前汇价问题
    在全国执行统一财政经济工作决定以后，国内金融物价逐渐趋于稳定，反映在汇价上，也出现了新的情况。
    今年四月以来，汇价的调整一反过去上升的局面，而形成下降的趋势；美汇从四月初最高的四万二千元下降至目前的三万二千二百元。在六月份以前，人们都了解这种变动是由于国内物价趋低的结果，但在六月以后，国内物价大体上已经稳定下来，汇价却又连续降低，于是就有人发生了疑问，汇价是根据什么订定的呢？目前的汇价是否过低？汇价降低的幅度是否过大？
    对于这些问题，我们以为首先应把决定汇价的根据弄清楚，才能得到正确的答案。
    一般的说，汇价是两国货币购买力的反映；具体的说，汇价的变动，是取决于国内一般物价、进出口物价和国外物价这几个因素的。因为这些因素能直接表现出两国货币对内与对外购买力的变化，而在汇价变动的过程上可以得到充分的说明。
    在今年四月以前，汇价是经常向上调整的，这不仅表明了政府鼓励出口与便利侨汇的方针，同时也适应着当时国内物价尚未稳定的情况。因此，汇价始终追随在国内一般物价和出口物价之后，作上升的调整。
    四月以后，牌价的调整即开始呈下降的趋势：
    从四月到六月这一时期中，汇价的下降，主要是因为国内一般物价及出口物价的平稳下落，不过，汇价的下降却不如物价下落那样大，因此便表现出汇价偏高。譬如天津四、五、六三个月的一般物价平均较三月份落２０％，出口物价落６％，而汇价仅落５．７％。在这里我们要特别指出的是：汇价下落幅度虽远较一般物价下落的幅度为小，但出口物价下落幅度却与汇价下落幅度相近。其原因是由于这一时期内出口物价追随着汇价，而没有和一般物价一致下落。这点虽表明政府对出口的扶持，但就整个说来，还有值得研究的地方。
    六月二十五日美帝直接指使李承晚匪帮发动侵略朝鲜的战争以后，美国物价全面上涨，根据新华社报道，在发动侵略朝鲜战争后一月内便上涨了１６．７２％，根据蒙迪氏（Moody）指数，若以四月为一百，美国的物价至八月上旬上涨了２５．７％。英国物价上涨的程度虽较和缓，而在同期中也上涨了１１．３％。这充分表明了美英两帝国主义国家货币贬值的程度。
    美英帝国主义货币贬值、物价上涨是它们进行新的战争冒险的结果，美帝自七月八日通过了达四二九亿四千八百万美元的一九五○年度财政支出预算后，杜鲁门又陆续提出六项增拨款项达一七二亿六千一百八十六万九千七百二十九美元，两者合计为六○二亿零九百八十六万九千七百二十九美元，而收入预算和增税所得，则仅四二○亿美元左右，赤字达一八二亿美元以上，几为全部支出３０％，其弥补方法，自只有增发通货，或以其他方式剥削人民，计在发动侵略战争一个月后，美帝政府的负债便增加了一、○二五、九四○、二一四·九六美元，黄金资产减少了九四、四五七、六九三·九二美元，而美钞流通量由六月二十一日至八月三日，却增加了一亿三千余万元。这就说明了美帝发动的侵略战争，已给美国人民带来了深重的灾难；另一方面也说明了帝国主义经济内部的危机。英帝情况，亦复如此，在扩军备战声中，六月二十七日增发债券五千万英镑，作为增发通货的准备，八月三日又在美帝压迫下宣布费用达三十四亿英镑的三年扩军计划，英镑流通数量，由六月二十一日至八月三日，也增加了四千万镑左右。凡此种种，都说明帝国主义通货贬值的程度，将日甚一日。
    反观我国美汇牌价，由四月份至八月上旬，计共降落２４．２％。这就是说，我国汇价的降落比美国物价上涨的比率（２５．７％）还低一些，而在同一时期内我国物价，以津、沪、穗三地而论，还降低了５．１％。因此，在这一段时期内，我们的汇价是必须及时调整的，否则我国国内物价，必将受美国物价上涨的影响而提高，也就是说人民币将随美元的贬值而贬值。
    因此，如果说在前一阶段中，汇价的上涨或下跌主要是由于国内物价的上涨或下落，那末，在目前汇价的向下调整，无疑的主要是由于外国物价上涨的这个新因素了。
    对于目前的汇价是否过低或偏高的问题，可从下述事实中得到说明。
    先对出口方面来说：
    从实物和汇价的折换率来看：在今年一、二月间美汇一元折合小米，除新春物价波动的一个期间内低到十六——十八斤外，经常都在二十五六斤左右；从四月份以来，则始终合到三十斤以上。再从各地折实牌价来看，四月以前，美汇一元分别合天津五——六个单位及上海四——五个单位；而在四月以后，一直到现在，则已分别合到七个及六个单位以上。根据过去出口商的经验，美汇一元能合二十八斤小米或六个折实单位，出口即属有利。如八月七日汇价变动后，以天津论，合折实单位六个半，合小米三十五斤以上，可见目前汇价仍旧能照顾出口的。自然，照顾出口并不等于能使每一种出口物品都有利，这不是汇价单独所能解决的问题，可另设法弥补，至于某些出口货在国外的价格变动，并不与国外一般物价变动尽相一致，这也是事实。但是国家决不能为照顾这些物品，而把外国货币贬值的损失，落到中国一般人民的肩上。
    再从进口方面来看：
    过去的汇价一般是照顾出口多，因此汇价往往是偏高，这在鼓励外销物资出口及争取外汇上是符合当时情况的。但自物价稳定以来，配合着国内经济建设，对于进口也要给以恰当程度的照顾。在本年五月以前，由于工商业尚在停滞状态，进口物资销路甚少，进口物价落在出口物价之后。自舟山解放，海上封锁基本消除，六月间工商业一般好转，工业器材需要增加，六月上旬起进口物价就回升，六月下旬到七月底，美帝发动侵朝战争以后，国际商品市场掀起涨风，影响到国内津沪穗三港口进口物价的更形上扬，这一时期的进口物价指数，都先后高过出口物价指数，以八月上旬平均的进出口指数为例，天津各为二○○·○七和一八二·三八，上海各为一九六·八三和一八七·六五，广州（八月十日）各为一二八·七九和八九·五五（基期：本年四月一日——二十日）。在这期间，汇价一路往下调整，进口商已有相当利润，尤其自八月七日调整汇价以来，进口利润有显著的增大，但要注意到这一局面若不继续从汇价上求配合是不能持久的，因为仅从几种主要进口货在香港市场的价格来看，设以六月下旬为一○○，七月上中下三旬平均各为一○六、一二八和一三六，七月底已达一五二，而国内进口物价指数，从六月下旬以来迄今涨势尚未超出３０％，目前国际市场的价格仍有继续上涨的趋势，加以美帝借口“战略物资”对我封锁，还迫使英帝在香港对我限制出口，都是加高我进口成本的因素，假使在汇价上面不加照顾，进口的利润势必减少，进口物资的供应，也受影响，所以今后对进口是与出口有同等的重要性，必须出进口兼顾才能与国内外的形势相配合。
    最后对侨汇方面来说：
    目前的汇价是能照顾侨汇的购买力的，这可以从下列事实得到证明：
    第一、自从国内物价稳定以来，外币黑市价格经常环绕在汇价的周围，以极小的幅度在变化，据最近的报导，华南各地外币黑市均落到汇价以下，且有继续下降的趋势。
    第二、把国内外实际生活费用与实物价格对比一下：据七月二十七日《远东经济评论》登载，在广州五口之家每日三餐（上等白米及菜肴）月需人民币五十万元，合港币九十六元，此数在港仅能购白米一担。
    再拿实物价格来比较，七月二十日香港大米每斤港币六角五分，照当日汇价折合人民币则在广州可购大米三斤二两，在福州、厦门、泉州可购一斤十一两。同日猪肉港价三元九角五分，但在广州、福州、厦门、泉州各地均可买到二斤左右。
    由上所述，可知目前的汇价不仅兼顾了出进口，同时也便利了侨汇。就人民币币值稳定和帝国主义国家因发动战争而引起的货币继续贬值的情形来看，目前汇价的机动调整是非常必要的。至于汇价变动幅度的大小，固然应照顾出进口贸易，但基本上是决定于两国金融物价变动的大小的。对于出进口贸易的照顾，还是从结汇时间的先后上去着手来得切实些，正如中国银行过去的延期结汇，和现在的预结外汇那样。对于侨汇的照顾，在个别地区可以采取其他办法去保证侨眷的生活。要求用汇价解决一切问题，那自然是有困难的。
    总之，汇价偏高推动了出口，却限制了进口；汇价偏低，鼓励了进口却又影响了出口，而且这里面还牵涉着侨汇问题。我们的汇价工作就是要在这三者之间，求得大体上的统一，所以每一个人都应该深刻的认识到：部分的利益应该服从全体的利益，部分的困难是可以用部分的办法去克服的。
