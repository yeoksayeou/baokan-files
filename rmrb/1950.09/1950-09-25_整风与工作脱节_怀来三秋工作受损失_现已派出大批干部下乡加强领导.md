　　Rectification Detached from Work
    Huailai's Autumn Harvest Suffers Losses
    A Large Number of Cadres Have Now Been Sent to the Countryside to Strengthen Leadership

[Our Newspaper’s Dispatch] According to news from the Chahar Daily: In Huailai County, Chahar Province, the rectification campaign has become detached from the autumn harvest work, and the leadership lags behind the actions of the masses, resulting in losses in the autumn harvest work. Corrections are currently being made. In mid-August, the county party committee’s enlarged rectification conference also made arrangements for the autumn harvest work. At the end of August, districts conveyed this to the villages. However, by the beginning of September, the masses in various places had already begun harvesting. In just over ten days, yams and millet were completely harvested, and some villages had already harvested half of all their autumn fields. At this time, the county leadership was busy with rectification and did not promptly understand the specific situation below, causing the autumn harvest movement to proceed spontaneously among the masses, resulting in significant losses in some areas. The biggest loss was the failure to achieve simultaneous harvesting and plowing. After the millet was harvested and half the grain crop was harvested, autumn plowing only began in some villages, and most villages had not yet harnessed their cattle. Some villages had not even assembled the plows. According to statistics from thirteen villages in the Third District, only seven villages had harnessed twenty-two plowing animals and started plowing, while the other six villages had not moved at all. In Tumuchuan Village, over three thousand mu of the six thousand mu of land had been harvested, but not a single mu had been plowed. Because the cadres failed to effectively organize and lead the field selection of seeds, some of the masses found it troublesome and simply did not do it, causing them to miss the good opportunity for field selection of seeds in the previous stage.

    The emergence of these phenomena is due, on the one hand, to the county and district leadership focusing solely on rectification, without closely integrating it with the actual situation and current autumn tasks, thereby relaxing the leadership of the autumn harvest work; on the other hand, the cadres also have problems with complacency and carelessness in their thinking. The autumn harvest work last year was relatively successful, and some cadres developed a sense of complacency. Some cadres said: The benefits of field selection of seeds and autumn plowing last year have been practically experienced by the masses (the crops grew well), so this year, without leadership, the masses will do it themselves. After the cadres' style of commandism was severely criticized in the rectification campaign, some people showed hesitation and dared not boldly lead the masses, fearing to commit commandism again. Therefore, after verbally publicizing and mobilizing, they did not specifically promote it. After the leadership discovered this deviation, they immediately reversed the incorrect understanding existing in the cadres' minds. A large number of cadres were transferred from various county-level departments to go deep into the districts and villages to lead the masses in the autumn harvest and autumn plowing. It was emphasized that the masses should be specifically organized to combine and insert plows, so as to achieve universal autumn plowing and strive for seed selection in every household. After learning of this situation, the Chanan Prefectural Committee has telegraphed this lesson to the county party committees to avoid similar deviations from occurring in other counties.

    Editor's Note: The lesson of the detachment of rectification from the autumn harvest work in Huailai County should attract the attention of rectification leading organs in various places. Chairman Mao has long instructed that the rectification movement should be carried out in close combination with, rather than separation from, various work tasks, in order to achieve the goal of improving cadres and improving work. This requires not only grasping the main problems in the work for inspection and summarization during the rectification, but also implementing the spirit of rectification to strengthen and improve the leadership of current practical work. However, the leading organs in Huailai County relaxed their leadership of the autumn harvest work during the rectification, causing unnecessary losses to the seed selection and autumn plowing work related to next year's production. In this way, no matter how many bureaucratic and commandist errors are exposed in the rectification movement in Huailai County, it has not actually achieved the goal of improving work. Therefore, all practices that separate rectification from work are wrong, and all attempts to wait until the end of the rectification movement before improving work should be opposed. Secondly, the lesson of Huailai County relaxing the leadership of the autumn harvest once again proves that the pride and complacency of cadres will inevitably lead to losses in work. In addition to taking concrete measures to strengthen the leadership of the autumn harvest, Huailai County must also earnestly correct all blind complacency in the rectification movement to improve the ideological level of cadres.

### 整风与工作脱节  怀来三秋工作受损失  现已派出大批干部下乡加强领导

　　整风与工作脱节
    怀来三秋工作受损失
    现已派出大批干部下乡加强领导
    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报消息：察哈尔省怀来县整风与秋收工作脱节，领导落后于群众行动，使秋收工作受到损失，现正进行纠正。八月中旬，县委整风扩大会议上也曾布置了三秋工作，八月下旬各区向村作了传达。但九月初各地群众已开始收割，十多天中山药、黍子全部收完，有些村子全部秋田已收割一半。这时，县领导上正忙于整风，而没有及时了解下面的具体情况，使秋收运动在群众中自发进行，部分地区受了很大损失。最大的损失是没有作到随收随耕。黍子收完了，谷子也收了一半，但秋耕只在部分村庄开始，大部村庄的牛犋还没有上套。有些村的牛犋还没有搭好犋。据三区十三个村的统计，只有七个村套起了二十二犋耕畜开始耕地，其余六村根本未动。土木全村六千多亩地已收割了三千来亩，地还一亩未耕。田间选种工作，因为干部未能很好的组织领导，有些群众嫌麻烦，就根本没有进行，使前一阶段田间选种的良好时机错过了。
    这些现象的产生，一方面是由于县、区领导上单纯进行整风，不按实际情况和当前秋季工作密切结合，因而放松了秋收工作的领导；另外，干部思想上也有麻痹大意的毛病。去年的三秋工作做得较有成绩，某些干部产生了自满情绪。有的干部说：去年田间选种、秋耕地的好处，群众都实际体验到了（庄稼长的好），今年不用领导群众自己也会干。整风中干部强迫命令的作风受到了严厉的批判后，有些人又表现了束手束脚，不敢大胆领导群众，怕再犯强迫命令。所以口头上宣传动员后，就不去具体推动了。领导上发觉这一偏向后，立即扭转了干部思想上存在的不正确的认识。从县级各部门抽调了大批干部，深入到各区、村领导群众秋收、秋耕。强调要具体组织群众合犋、插犋。达到土地普遍秋耕，并争取户户选种。察南地委了解这一情况后，已将这一教训电告各县委，以免类似偏向在其他县里发生。        
    编者按：怀来县整风与秋收工作脱节的教训应该引起各地整风领导机关的注意。毛主席早已指示，整风运动应在和各项工作任务密切地相结合而不是相分离的条件下进行，以达到提高干部改进工作的目的，这就要求在整风中不但要抓紧工作中的主要问题进行检查总结；同时还应贯彻整风精神加强与改进对当前实际工作的领导。而怀来县的领导机关在整风时，却放松了对三秋工作的领导，使有关明年生产的选种与秋耕工作受到不应有的损失。这样，不管怀来县在整风运动中揭发了多少官僚主义与命令主义的错误，实际上却没有达到改进工作的目的。因之，凡是整风与工作相分离的作法都是不对的，凡是企图等待整风运动结束后再去改进工作的作法都是应该反对的。其次，怀来县放松秋收领导的教训再次证明：干部中的骄傲自满情绪必将使工作遭受损失。怀来县除采取具体措施加强秋收领导外，还须在整风运动中认真纠正一切盲目自满情绪，使干部思想水平提高一步。
