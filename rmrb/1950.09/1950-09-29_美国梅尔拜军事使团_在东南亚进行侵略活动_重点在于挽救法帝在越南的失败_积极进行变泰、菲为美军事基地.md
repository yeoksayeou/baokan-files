　　U.S. Melby Military Mission
    Engages in Aggressive Activities in Southeast Asia
    Focusing on Salvaging the French Imperialists' Failure in Vietnam
    Actively Transforming Thailand and the Philippines into US Military Bases
    [Reported by this newspaper] According to a report from the Wah Shing News Agency: The U.S. military mission led by U.S. State Department official Melby, including U.S. Department of Defense representative Erskine, after arriving in the Philippines on July 12 and proceeding to Vietnam, Malaya, and Thailand, returned to the Philippines on the 16th.
    The focus of the U.S. military delegation's two-month-long aggressive activities in Southeast Asian countries this time is to salvage the increasingly hopeless position of French imperialism in Vietnam and to attempt to turn Vietnam into a military springboard for the U.S. ruling clique's aggression against Southeast Asian countries. The U.S. military mission arrived in Saigon on July 17 and spent 20 days in Vietnam. The U.S. military mission promised that "the United States would supply weapons and equipment to make the French army stronger" so that the French army could use American weapons and fight under American command for American aggressive purposes.
    The U.S. military mission went to Bangkok via Singapore on August 26. During its stay in Malaya and Thailand, the U.S. military mission held continuous talks with the heads of the British colonial army in Malaya and Thai Ministry of Defense officials to discuss the issue of "military assistance." According to a Bangkok dispatch from the Kuomintang Central News Agency: The U.S. military mission inspected military facilities in various locations, and Pibul Songkhram also told the cabinet that "Thailand can allow the U.S. military to use these bases." The reactionary Thai government will obtain new equipment from the U.S. "military aid." According to a United Press report on the 20th: Pibul Songkhram told reporters from the Bangkok Forum that the United States would give Thailand weapons worth 30 million US dollars, which could equip nine battalions of men.
    After returning to Manila, the U.S. military mission held meetings with Philippine President Quirino, the heads of the Department of National Defense and the Armed Forces on the 18th and 19th. According to Agence France-Presse: The U.S. and the Philippines are "discussing more broadly implementing the U.S.-Philippine military agreement concluded in 1947" in order to turn the Philippines into a U.S. military base in Southeast Asia.
    The aggressive activities carried out by the U.S. military mission in Southeast Asian countries this time have once again exposed the conspiracy of U.S. imperialists to enslave the people of Southeast Asia.

　　美国梅尔拜军事使团
    在东南亚进行侵略活动
    重点在于挽救法帝在越南的失败
    积极进行变泰、菲为美军事基地
    【本报讯】据华新社讯：由美国国务院官员梅尔拜所率领，包括美国国防部代表厄斯琴的美国军事使团，自七月十二日抵达菲律宾，转赴越南、马来亚、泰国活动后，已于十六日重返菲律宾。
    美国军事代表团此次在东南亚各国进行为时两个月的侵略活动的重点，在于挽救法帝国主义在越南已趋穷途末路的地位，并妄图把越南变为美国统治集团侵略东南亚各国的军事跳板。美国军事使团于七月十七日抵达西贡后，在越南活动达二十天之久美国军事使团允诺以“美国供给武器和装备，使得法国军队更为强大”，以便法国军队使用美国武器、在美国人的指挥下为美国的侵略目的作战。
    美国军事使团于八月二十六日经新加坡转赴曼谷。美国军事使团在马来亚和泰国停留期间，曾与马来亚英殖民军首脑及泰国国防部官员连续会谈，商讨“军事援助”问题。据国民党中央社曼谷讯：美国军事使团曾视察各地军事设备，銮披汶亦曾告诉内阁说：“泰国可以允许美军使用这种基地。”泰国反动政府则将从美国“军援”中获得新式装备。据合众社二十日消息：銮披汶在接见曼谷论坛报记者时称：美国将给泰国价值三千万美元的武器，可装备九营人。
    美国军事使团在返抵马尼拉后，于十八、十九日与菲总统季里诺、国防部和武装部队等首脑们举行会议。据法新社消息：美菲双方“正商议更广泛地实行美菲一九四七年缔结的军事协定”，以便把菲律宾变成美国在东南亚的军事基地。
    美国军事使团此次在东南亚各国进行的侵略活动，再一次暴露了美帝国主义者企图奴役东南亚人民的阴谋。
