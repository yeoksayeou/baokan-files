Short Commentary

	On the Automobile Driver Fuel Theft Incident

	The Government Administration Council agencies discovered automobile driver fuel theft incidents during this streamlining and economizing inspection. The reason this incident was discovered was mainly due to leading cadres conducting thorough inspections, providing drivers and workers with in-depth ideological education, and raising their awareness, which led twenty drivers and workers to voluntarily confess the amount of fuel they had stolen and the methods they used. The amount of fuel stolen reached 1,328 gallons, equivalent to 45 million RMB. The methods of theft were diverse: some colluded with certain private automobile companies to cheat; others conspired with bad elements among the retained police to engage in trickery together. This is a significant waste and should attract the attention of all agencies. In some places, in addition to fuel theft, there are illegal activities such as stealing and selling parts and smuggling. All agencies should regularly inspect and prevent these.

	Such things were commonplace in the old society, and whoever stole the most was considered the most capable. However, in the new society, in the new China, such phenomena should no longer exist. Workers, having become masters of their own country, should cherish the state's resources everywhere, economize on state expenditures everywhere, and think of everything for the sake of building our own country. Therefore, we must strengthen the education of drivers and workers and raise their consciousness. We must strengthen management, formulate methods, and have them consciously abide by them in order to correct the corrupt lifestyle of some drivers and workers. Those who have genuine difficulties in life should be given appropriate care. Workers who have made mistakes but can voluntarily confess and correct their fuel theft errors should be encouraged.

	At the same time, private automobile companies that acquire gasoline through speculative and opportunistic means should be given the punishments they deserve. Individual retained police officers who harbor or collude in malfeasance should also be inspected and dealt with by their competent authorities.

　　关于汽车司机偷油事件
    政务院机关在此次精简节约检查中发现了汽车司机偷油的事件。这一事件所以能够发现，主要是由于领导干部深入检查，对司机工人进行了较深入的思想教育，提高了他们的觉悟，使二十个司机工人自动说出了他们偷油的数量与方法。被偷的油，竟达一千三百二十八加仑，折合人民币四千五百万元。其偷窃方法是多种多样的：或与某些私人汽车行拉拢作弊；或与留用警察中的坏分子勾结，共同捣鬼。这是一个很大的浪费，应该引起各机关的注意。有些地方，偷油之外，还有盗卖零件及走私等等不法行为，各机关应该经常加以检查与制止。
    这种事情在旧社会是平常的事，而且认为谁偷的多，谁最能干。但在新社会、新中国，则不应该再有这种现象。工人做了自己国家的主人，就应该处处爱护国家的资财，就应该处处节省国家的开支，就是一切都要为了建设我们自己的国家着想。因此，我们必须加强对司机工人的教育，提高他们的自觉性。要加强管理，制定办法，由他们自觉遵守，以纠正某些司机工人生活腐化的现象。对生活上确有困难的，则应予以适当的照顾。对犯了错误而又能自动坦白与纠正偷油错误的工人，则应予以鼓励。
    同时，对于某些以投机取巧的手法收购汽油的私人汽车行，应给予应得的处分。对于包庇或串通舞弊的个别留用警察，亦应由其主管机关注意检查处理。
