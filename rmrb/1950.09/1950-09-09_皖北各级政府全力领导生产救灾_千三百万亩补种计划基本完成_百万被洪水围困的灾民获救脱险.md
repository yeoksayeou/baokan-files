　　Anhui North Level Governments Fully Lead Production and Disaster Relief
    13 Million Mu of Replanting Plans Basically Completed
    One Million Flood-Stranded Victims Rescued and Safe
    [This newspaper Hefei News] Reporter Lin Hong, Correspondents Jiang Huazhong, Ji Kedong reported: After completing the rescue of disaster victims, the production disaster relief work in the Huaihe River flood area in northern Anhui has achieved significant results. The entire district's 13 million mu replanting plan has been basically completed; disaster relief, resettlement, medical, and other work have all achieved certain results.
    As of the end of July, over one million disaster victims in the Huaihe River area of northern Anhui, trapped by floods on remnant embankments, high ground, rooftops, or treetops, have been rescued from dangerous areas under the emergency rescue efforts of governments at all levels. At the beginning of the flooding, cadres at all levels, as well as some commanders, fighters, teachers, students, and the masses, immediately joined the rescue operation, battling the wind, waves, and rain day and night, fighting the floods, often without a full meal, and unable to sleep for three or five nights, deeply moving the disaster victims. For example, an old woman named Liu Zhuang from Ganji District, Funan County, who was rescued, said: "My three children and I owe our lives to the government. That day when the flood entered the village, I carried one child and held another and climbed onto the roof. It rained so hard all night that we couldn't lift our heads, and the roof collapsed at dawn. We sat on the wall shouting for help. Just then, Township Head Zhang and a soldier rowed up and rescued my children and me. If they had been any later, we would have drifted away to who knows where." After she finished speaking, she cried with gratitude.
    After the disaster in Funan County, the government rescued over 30,000 disaster victims in two days. In Wuhe County, after Deputy Director Li of the Administrative Office received news of the breach of the Mohekou Huai embankment at midnight on July 26th, he immediately woke up the cadres and led the boats to the disaster area overnight in the rain, going up and down in the four-foot-high floodwaters, rescuing along each village. In Yingshang County, all 500,000 disaster victims were rescued quickly by the People's Government. Government workers and troops stationed in Funan County rescued more than 20,000 disaster victims, as well as many draught cattle, clothes, and grain, in two or three days. A total of more than 10,000 boats were mobilized for this rescue, with more than 4,000 in Bengbu alone. Because of the emergency rescue by the People's Government, although this year's flood was more serious than the one in 1931, the losses were much smaller. In 1931, more than 20,000 people died in the flood; this year, only over 400 people were swept away by the floods or crushed to death by collapsed houses because they could not escape in time.
    Rescued Disaster Victims Receive Emergency Aid; Most Have Been Resettled
    After the disaster victims were rescued, in addition to those who had relatives and friends to rely on, the local people's governments immediately took them in and distributed relief grain. Then, they were resettled as much as possible in the less affected areas within the county and special district, to wait for the water to recede and return home to production. Those who lacked food and clothing continued to receive relief grain from the government. The situation was very serious in Fuyang and Suxian Special Districts, with too many disaster victims. According to the decision of the Anhui North Administrative Office, some of them have been evacuated and resettled in the four special districts of Chaohu, Anqing, Lu'an, and Chuxian in Huainan. According to recent incomplete statistics, more than 142,000 seriously affected people have been evacuated from Fuyang and Suxian special districts and resettled in the above-mentioned areas. Chuxian Special District originally had 70,000 seriously affected people. Together with those evacuated from other areas, it resettled a total of 130,000 seriously affected people. Lu'an Special District originally had 100,000 seriously affected people. Together with those evacuated from other areas, it resettled a total of about 120,000 people. Fuyang Special District originally had 620,000 seriously affected people, and Suxian Special District had 300,000 people. In addition to those who have been evacuated and a small number who will continue to be evacuated to other areas, the rest have been resettled within the special districts.
    The people's governments at all levels adopted an extremely cautious and responsible attitude in the work of evacuating and resettling disaster victims. The local governments first mobilized and organized the disaster victims, and responsible cadres personally led them to the resettlement areas. The governments responsible for resettling disaster victims established county, district, and village disaster victim resettlement committees or groups in advance, and prepared housing, furniture, food, and other necessities for the disaster victims, and established reception stations in appropriate locations. The people of Huainan welcomed the arrival of the disaster victims from northern Anhui and demonstrated the spirit of "farmers all over the world are one family." Various places also launched donation campaigns to prepare the necessary items for the disaster victims as much as possible. Therefore, after the disaster victims from northern Anhui arrived in the above-mentioned areas, they were quickly and properly resettled. Moreover, with the help of local cadres and the masses, many disaster victims have begun to engage in production or other work. Only some disaster victims, because they hoped that the Huai River harnessing project would start soon so that they could return to their homes in northern Anhui, or because production problems had not been completely resolved, were uneasy and spontaneously fled. For example, in Chuxian County, out of more than 12,000 people resettled, more than 1,000 spontaneously fled. Other places such as Renhe Township in Dingyuan and Dali Township in Fengyang also saw disaster victims spontaneously leaving the resettlement areas. The main reasons are: (1) The leadership at some county, district, and township levels only paid attention to the resettlement work and did not make great efforts to completely solve the production problem (the short time, the large number of disaster victims, and the small number of cadres were the objective reasons). Education and inspection at the lower levels were also insufficient, and some village cadres still had irresponsible ideas and feared difficulties ideologically. (2) Some local people had not eliminated ideological concerns and were afraid that the arrival of disaster victims would affect their lives, so they developed some "exclusionary" ideas. (3) Some disaster victims had dependent thinking and relied solely on relief. This was because some areas did not provide enough education when mobilizing disaster victims for evacuation, the slogans raised were too high, and after the disaster victims arrived in the resettlement areas, some cadres failed to help them solve specific difficulties. Currently, the Chuxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Anhui North Administrative Office have instructed cadres at all levels to earnestly do a good job in resettling disaster victims in response to these situations.
    In addition, some disaster victims escaped in the face of the rapid rise of the Huai River and the widespread breaches of the dikes, when the situation was extremely critical. A CCP branch in a certain township wrote in a letter of introduction for a party member: "This is to certify that so-and-so is a member of our party and is now fleeing to the highlands." This illustrates the tension of the situation at the time, making it impossible to organize the evacuation of disaster victims. The local governments are also actively taking in this group of unorganized disaster victims who escaped in a scattered manner and are stranded in urban areas such as Chuxian. The Anhui North Administrative Office is also preparing to provide additional relief grain to the sick among them.
    As of now, in order to provide emergency aid to disaster victims without clothing and food, the Anhui North Administrative Office has distributed more than 45.4 million jin of rice from the emergency relief grain and dike-breach-blocking grain allocated by the central government and East China, as well as more than 17.99 million jin of rice for dike-breach-blocking grain as a form of work relief. The total of these two items is more than 63.4 million jin of rice, equivalent to about 95 million jin of raw grain.
    Rush to Block Breaches, Adjust Seeds, and Organize Disaster Victims to Replenish Late Autumn Crops
    Based on the objective conditions in northern Anhui, the Anhui North Administrative Office believes that restoring agricultural production is the basic link in overcoming the disaster in the future. Therefore, replenishing late autumn crops occupies a very important position in all production disaster relief work. From the Administrative Office to the district and village, great importance is attached to this work. In recent months, there has been no rainfall in northern Anhui, and the Huai River has been receding day by day. The plains in the general areas of northern Anhui have mostly emerged from the water, except for the areas close to the banks of the Huai River, such as Funan, Yingshang, Fengtai, and Wuhe counties, where most areas are still flooded. Wherever the water has receded, the local government immediately actively leads the masses to carry out dike blocking and replenishing work. Suxian Special District has blocked 209 breaches. Fuyang Special District blocked 12 breaches along the Shahe River on August 20. Lu'an Special District blocked 3 breaches on August 20. While rushing to block breaches, various places are also working hard to replenish late autumn crops. According to statistics from reports from various places, Fuyang Special District has replenished more than 7.21 million mu, accounting for 46% of the flooded land area; Suxian Special District has replenished 4.2 million mu, accounting for more than 30% of the flooded land area; Chuxian Special District has replenished more than 620,000 mu, accounting for 80% of the flooded land area; Lu'an Special District has replenished 470,000 mu (including only Huoqiu and Shou County), and Bengbu has replenished more than 14,000 mu. The above totals more than 12.5 million mu. If the unreported numbers from various places are added, the replenishing plan of 9 million mu to 13 million mu has been basically completed and may be exceeded.
    In the early stage of replenishment, the most difficult problem was the lack of seeds. With the strong support of the central government and East China, as of August 28, more than 10.52 million jin of seeds have been lent and distributed, and another 6.5 million jin of raw grain and 400,000 jin of rice have been allocated to the three special districts of Fuyang, Suxian, and Lu'an for the masses to purchase seeds themselves, which has largely solved the seed problem. The other small portion of seeds was solved by the masses themselves under the principle of mutual assistance, mutual borrowing, and free lending.
    In the early stage of mobilizing replenishment, the masses generally had concerns about "insect infestations" and "being flooded again," and had the idea of simply relying on government relief. Later, through various means such as convening disaster victim representative meetings, mass meetings, discussion meetings, and activist meetings, by carefully calculating accounts, evaluating and distributing relief grain and loans, and exchanging experience in surviving the famine, the masses' confidence in production was gradually increased and the idea of simply relying on relief was overcome. For example, when Licang Township in Mengcheng County convened a disaster victim representative meeting, Wang Defa from Wanghai Village said: "Fleeing the famine, fleeing the famine, the more you flee, the more barren it becomes; fleeing the famine is not a good solution." Another example is the masses in Funan County, who initially had a strong idea of relying on government relief. After discussion at the disaster victim representative meeting in the county, many representatives realized that the Huai River is hundreds of miles long and tens of miles wide, all of it is water, and it is impossible for the government to provide relief to everyone. Many representatives recalled the government's strong disaster relief efforts this spring and said: "We have been asking the government for help, and we are really sorry to the government. If the Kuomintang was still here, no one would care if we starved to death. We can't just rely on the government, we must all think of ways together!" After repeated and in-depth publicity and explanation in various places, the masses' enthusiasm for production rose, and they rushed to plant day and night.
    Large Numbers of Medical Personnel Rush to Disaster Areas to Vigorously Carry Out Medical and Epidemic Prevention Work
    Since the outbreak of the flood, disaster victims in various places have been exposed to wind and rain, living in damp areas, drinking unclean water, and lacking nutrition, resulting in weakened resistance. Various diseases have begun to spread in the disaster area, with smallpox, gastrointestinal diseases, and relapsing fever being the most common. Governments at all levels have taken emergency measures to transfer medical personnel, mobilize local folk doctors, and jointly form epidemic prevention and medical teams to go deep into the disaster areas to treat the disaster victims. In some areas, epidemic prevention injections have been widely administered to disaster victims to prevent the spread of diseases. For example, in Fuyang Special District, there are more than 26,000 patients, most of whom have gastrointestinal diseases and malaria. The special district health bureau has transferred 87 medical staff from various counties and districts, formed seven groups, and dispatched them to Funan, Fengtai, Yingshang, and Fuyang to provide emergency treatment. As of early August, more than 13,000 disaster victims in the entire special district have received medical treatment. More than 12,000 disaster victims in Chengguan Town, Huaiyuan County, have been completely injected with epidemic prevention agents by the county health bureau. In addition, the Central Ministry of Health, the East China Military and Political Committee Health Department, the Nanjing Health Bureau, and the Southeast Medical College have sent medical teams to the disaster areas in northern Anhui to assist in medical and epidemic prevention work. The above-mentioned units have a total of more than 500 medical personnel distributed in various disaster areas, and they have all achieved great results.

　　皖北各级政府全力领导生产救灾
    千三百万亩补种计划基本完成
    百万被洪水围困的灾民获救脱险
    【本报合肥讯】记者林洪、通讯员江化中、姬克东报道：皖北淮河水灾区域在完成抢救灾民工作之后，生产救灾工作已获显著成绩。全区一千三百万亩的补种计划已基本完成；灾民的救济、安置、医疗等工作均已收到一定成效。
    截至七月底，皖北沿淮地区被洪水围困于残堤、高岗、屋顶或树梢的百余万灾民，在各级人民政府的紧急抢救下，均已脱离危险地带。洪水成灾之初，各级干部及一部分指战员、教员、学生、群众，立即投入抢救运动，昼夜冒着风浪暴雨，与洪水斗争，一天不得一饱，三夜五夜不能睡觉，予灾胞以深切感动。如阜南县干集区刘庄村一位被救的大娘说：“我娘儿三口多亏政府救了命。那天大水进村时，我抱一个夹一个（孩子）上了屋。一夜大雨打得抬不起头，天亮时屋顶也塌下去了，我们坐在墙头上直喊救命，就在那时候，张乡长和一位战士驾船赶上来，把我娘儿救出，再要迟一点，我娘儿们就不知漂到那里去了”。说完，感激得哭了起来。
    阜南县灾情发生后，政府在两天内救出三万多灾民。在五河县，七月二十六日半夜，行署李副主任接到沫河口淮堤溃决的消息后，立即喊醒干部，连夜拖带船只冒雨赶往灾区，在四尺高的水头中翻上翻下，沿着每个村庄抢救。颍上县的五十万灾民，在人民政府迅速抢救下，全部脱险。阜南县人民政府工作人员和驻该地区的部队，两三天中就救出了两万余灾民，以及许多耕牛、衣服、粮食等。此次抢救共动员了一万余只船，仅蚌埠一地即达四千余只。因为人民政府的紧急抢救，今年水灾虽比一九三一年的还严重，但损失却比一九三一年小得多。按一九三一年因水灾死亡的人民达二万多人；今年只有四百余人因逃跑不及给洪水卷去或塌房压死。
    脱险灾民得到急救  大部并已安置就绪
    灾民被救出后，除有亲朋可投靠者外，各地人民政府立即加以收容，发给救济粮。然后在本县和本专区内的轻灾地区，尽量加以安置，以待水退，即回家生产。其中衣食无着者，政府并继续发给救济粮。阜阳和宿县两专区灾情十分严重，灾民过多，其中的一部分，根据皖北行署的决定，已疏散安置到淮南的巢湖、安庆、六安和滁县四个专区。根据最近不完全的统计，由阜阳和宿县两专区疏散安置到上述各地的重灾民，已达十四万二千余人。滁县本专区原有重灾民七万人，连同外区疏散来的，共安置了十三万重灾民。六安本专区原有重灾民十万人，连同外区疏散来的，约共安置了十二万人。阜阳专区原有重灾民六十二万人，宿县专区有三十万人，该两专区除已疏散和还有少数将继续疏散到外区的以外，其余均已在本专区内安置。
    各地人民政府在疏散与安置灾民的工作中，采取了极为慎重和负责的态度，先由当地政府将灾民动员好，组织好，由负责干部亲自率领至安置地区；负责安置灾民地区的政府，均在事前成立了县、区、村的安置灾民委员会或小组，将灾民所需的住房、家具、食物等准备妥当，并在适当地点成立了接收站。淮南各地人民对于淮北灾民的到达，均十分欢迎，发挥了天下农民是一家的精神。各地并掀起了捐献运动，尽可能的为灾民准备好必需的东西。因此，淮北灾民到达上述各地后，迅速得到妥善安置。并且有许多灾民，在当地干部、群众的协助下，已开始进行生产，或从事其他工作。只有部分灾民，因盼望治淮早日动工，以便回到淮北家乡，或因生产问题未得到彻底解决，存在着不安心和自动逃荒的现象。如滁县安插一万二千多人，自动逃荒者有一千余人，其他如定远仁和乡、凤阳大李乡等处也有灾民自动离开被安置地区的现象，考其主要原因：（一）部分的县、区、乡领导方面，只注意了安插工作，还未大力设法彻底解决生产问题（时间短促，灾民多、干部少，是其客观原因），对下面的教育、检查也很不够，还有部分乡村干部在思想上仍存在着不负责任、怕困难的现象。（二）当地部分群众思想顾虑未清除，怕灾民来了自己的生活会受影响，因此产生了某些“排外”思想。（三）部分灾民存在着依赖思想，专靠救济，这是某些地区在动员灾民疏散时，教育不够，提的口号过高，而灾民到了安置地后，部分干部又未能帮助他们解决具体困难所致。现滁县专署与皖北行署已针对这些情况指示各级干部认真做好安置灾民工作。
    此外，还有部分灾民，是在淮水猛涨，河堤普遍溃决，情势十分危急之下逃出来的。某乡中共支部给一个党员的介绍信上，这样写着：兹证明某某是我党党员，现到高地一带逃荒。这可以说明当时情况的紧张，不可能去进行灾民的组织疏散工作。各地政府对于这一批无组织的分散逃出、流落在滁县等城关区的灾民，亦正积极加以收容。皖北行署并准备对其中的病患者，加发救济粮。
    截至目前为止，皖北行署为了急救无衣无食的灾民，已从中央和华东拨下的急救粮与堵口粮中，发放了救济粮四千五百四十余万斤大米，以及以工代赈的堵口粮一千七百九十九万余斤大米。两者合计共大米六千三百四十余万斤，折合原粮约九千五百万斤。
    抢堵决口调剂种子  组织灾民补种晚秋
    根据皖北的客观条件，皖北行署认为恢复农业生产，是今后战胜灾荒的基本环节。因此，补种晚秋在全部生产救灾工作中，占着十分重要的地位。从行署到区、村，对这一工作均十分重视。近月以来，皖北各地未降雨，淮水已逐日下落。淮北一般地区的平地已大部脱出，只有紧靠淮河两岸的阜南、颍上、凤台和五河等县大部地区的积水尚未退去。凡水已退去的地区，当地政府即积极领导群众进行堵口、补种的工作。宿县专区已堵好决口二百零九个。阜阳专区于八月二十日堵好沙河沿岸的决口十二个。六安专区于八月二十日堵好决口三个。与抢堵决口同时，各地并紧张进行补种晚秋。根据各地报告材料统计，阜阳专区已补种七百二十一万余亩，占被淹土地面积的百分之四十六；宿县专区补种四百二十万亩，占被淹土地面积的百分之三十多；滁县专区补种六十二万余亩，占被淹土地面积的百分之八十；六安专区补种四十七万亩（仅包括霍邱、寿县），蚌埠补种一万四千余亩。以上共计一千二百五十余万亩，如加上各地未报来数目估计，九百万亩到一千三百万亩的补种计划已基本完成，并可能争取超过计划。
    在补种初期，最困难的问题是缺乏种籽；经中央和华东大力支援，截至八月二十八日，已贷发种籽一千零五十二万余斤，并另拨给阜阳、宿县、六安三专区原粮六百五十万斤，大米四十万斤，贷给群众自行购买种籽，使种籽问题大部获得解决。另外的小部分种籽，是在互助互借和自由借贷的原则下，由群众自己解决的。
    在动员补种的初期，群众中普遍存在着“怕虫吃”“怕再淹”的顾虑，并有单纯依赖政府救济的思想。后经各地召开灾民代表会、群众会、座谈会、积极分子会等，通过算细账、评发救济粮和贷种，以及交流度荒经验等方式，逐渐提高了群众对生产的信心，克服了单纯依靠救济的思想。如蒙城县立仓乡召开灾民代表会时，王海村的王德法说：“逃荒，逃荒，越逃越荒；逃荒不是好办法。”再如阜南县群众，起初依赖政府救济的思想很重，经该县灾民代表会讨论，许多代表都认识到，淮河沿岸几百里长，几十里宽，都是水，全要政府救济是不行的。许多代表回忆了政府今春大力救灾的情形后说：“我们一直向政府要，真是对不起政府；要是国民党还在这里，饿死了也没有人管。不能光依赖政府，必须大家一齐想办法！”各地经过这样反复深入的宣传解释后，群众的生产情绪高涨，白天黑夜紧急抢种。
    大批医务人员赶赴灾区  紧张展开医疗防疫工作
    自水灾发生以来，各地灾民饱经风吹雨打，住宿潮湿地区，饮水不洁，加上营养不足，抵抗力减弱，灾区已开始流行各种病症。其中以天花、肠胃病、回归热等最多。各地人民政府已采取紧急措施，抽调医务人员，发动当地民间医生，共同组成防疫医疗队，深入灾区，为灾民治病，某些地区并普遍为灾民注射防疫剂，以免疾病蔓延。如阜阳专区有病患者二万六千余人，大部为肠胃病及疟疾等。专署卫生院已抽调各县、区医务工作人员八十七人，编成七个小组，分赴阜南、凤台、颍上和阜阳等地，进行急治。至八月初，全专区经过医疗的灾民已达一万三千余人。怀远县城关镇一万二千余灾民，已经该县卫生院全部注射防疫剂。此外，中央卫生部、华东军政委员会卫生部、南京卫生局和东南医学院等单位，分别派出医疗队赴皖北灾区，协助进行医疗防疫工作。上述各单位分布在灾区各地的医务人员共有五百余人，均已收到很大成效。
