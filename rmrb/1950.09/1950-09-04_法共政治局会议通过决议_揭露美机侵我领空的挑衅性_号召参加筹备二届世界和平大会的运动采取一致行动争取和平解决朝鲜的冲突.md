Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 2nd: TASS, Paris, September 2nd: The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, at its meeting on August 31st, passed a resolution exposing the provocative nature of the bombing of Chinese territory by American aircraft. The Political Bureau emphasized that the aim of American policy is to expand the conflict, and called on all people to immediately participate in the movement to prepare for the Second World Peace Congress to be convened in accordance with the resolution passed in Prague. The Political Bureau urged the French people to take concerted action to achieve a peaceful resolution of the Korean conflict based on the proposal of Soviet representative Malik in the United Nations.

The resolution pointed out that the French government's policy of actively participating in the war has resulted in a massive increase in taxes, making it a heavy burden on the people of the whole country. The Pleven-Mollet government opposes wage increases, and together with the major manufacturers, "Workers' Force," and the leaders of the French Christian Labor Confederation, has determined a minimum wage, which is actually used as an excuse to further reduce wages. The Political Bureau called on working people of all tendencies within the trade unions and non-union workers to further unite their forces in various enterprises so that their legitimate demands - a minimum wage of 17,500 francs - can be met.

The Political Bureau believes that the acquittal of the eighteen peace fighters of Roanne by the Lyon Military Tribunal proves the power of the united action of the masses and the strong movement of peace advocates. This is a condemnation of the Pleven-Mollet government's policy of refusing to protect national interests and its policy of war. It will encourage the people to wage an unyielding struggle to release all imprisoned patriots, peace fighters, and working people.

The Political Bureau called on all people to support the telegrams sent to the government by the General Confederation of Labor, the French Republican Youth League, the French Women's League, and the French Young Women's League, and demanded the immediate exchange of prisoners of war in Vietnam.

　　法共政治局会议通过决议
    揭露美机侵我领空的挑衅性
    号召参加筹备二届世界和平大会的运动采取一致行动争取和平解决朝鲜的冲突
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社巴黎二日讯：法国共产党政治局于八月三十一日会议中通过决议，揭露美国飞机轰炸中国领土的挑衅性质。政治局强调美国政策的目的在于扩大冲突，并号召全体人民立即参加筹备依照在布拉格通过的决议而召开的第二届世界和平大会的运动。政治局敦促法国人民采取一致行动，以达到根据苏联代表马立克在联合国中的提案，和平解决朝鲜的冲突。
    决议指出：法国政府积极参加战争的政策，已经造成捐税的大量增加，使其成为全国人民的沉重负担。普利文——摩勒政府反对增加工资，并且和大制造商们、“工人力量”以及法国基督教劳工联盟的领袖们一致，确定了最低工资，而实际是以此作为进一步减少工资的借口。政治局号召各工会内各种倾向的劳动人民以及非工会会员的工人们，在各企业中进一步团结他们的力量，使他们提出的合法的要求——一万七千五百法郎的最低工资——得到满足。
    政治局认为罗安地方十八名和平战士们之被里昂军事法庭宣判无罪，证明了人民大众的一致行动与和平拥护者的强大运动之力量。这是对普利文——摩勒政府采取拒绝保护民族利益的政策和战争的政策的一种斥责。它将鼓励人民为争取释放一切被监禁的爱国分子、拥护和平的战士以及劳动人民而进行不屈不挠的斗争。
    政治局号召全体人民拥护总工会、法兰西共和青年联盟、法兰西妇女联盟、法国女青年联盟等致政府的电文，并要求立即交换在越南的战俘。
