　　[Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: Under the direct leadership of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the leading cadres of the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in accordance with the spirit of the Trade Union Law and in conjunction with the rectification campaign, reviewed the work of the trade unions and found the following shortcomings: First, regarding the nature of trade unions, everyone's understanding of "trade unions are mass organizations voluntarily combined by the working class" is vague, and staff and technical personnel are not clearly seen as part of the working class. Therefore, although the trade union has organized 68 percent (according to statistics at the end of June this year) of the city's 210,000 employees into the union, it has not been more actively absorbed technical personnel and staff. In order to emphasize the "purity" and advanced role of the trade union, new workers are emphasized on investigation and understanding, fearing that their composition is complicated. For mobile workers, it is considered difficult to organize and that the organization does not play a large role. Trade union work remains in the circle of old cadres, and it is believed that without the dispatch of old cadres, it is impossible to organize a trade union or it is impossible to carry out work after organizing it. As a result, the organization of trade unions in agencies, culture, and education has been delayed. Moreover, the activities of general trade unions are only confined to a narrow circle of a few activists, and have not absorbed the participation of the broad masses. Second, the trade union's implementation of the policy of facing production is not comprehensive and thorough. Although general trade union cadres have realized that they must face production, some factories and mines trade unions have made better achievements in leading production; however, most trade unions are only general appeals, and have not further penetrated into the production process, into the workshop team, grasped the key to production, and organized forces to actively and proactively solve specific problems. At the same time, some factory and mine trade unions only pay attention to production, while ignoring the possible and necessary improvement of workers' lives and working conditions. The view of completing production tasks is often one-sided, paying only attention to ensuring quantity, and lacking a unified understanding of quality and cost. In the work, because the Party, government, and trade union are not well coordinated, they often disengage from each other and offset their strength. Third, regarding the organizational principles of trade unions, although the trade union organizations are basically organized according to the principle of democratic centralism, the phenomena of appointment and officialdom still exist quite seriously. For example, workers do not know about the transfer of trade union cadres, and new cadres are neither elected nor formally notified; on the other hand, the phenomenon of arbitrarily advancing or postponing the re-election of members of the trade union committee in violation of the articles of association is also quite common. The trade union committee does not hold regular meetings to report its work and listen to workers' criticisms and suggestions. Some groups do not hold group meetings for three or four months, and some group leaders do not even know who the members are. The study and implementation of resolutions from higher authorities is very poor, many major issues are not reported, and requests for instructions and reports from lower levels are not answered in a timely manner.

　　After checking out the above problems, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions believes that if the future work of the trade union is not fundamentally transformed and improved in accordance with the spirit of the Trade Union Law, it will not be able to give play to the strength of the trade union organization, which will have a significant impact on economic construction. It has been decided to first seek methods of improvement and implementation in the rectification of cadres above the section chief level, and at the same time, prepare to widely publicize the Trade Union Law through newspapers, radio stations, spare-time schools, and cultural centers.

　　沈阳市总工会在整风中学习工会法检查工作
    在团结全体工人阶级及面向生产方面缺点很多
    将广泛宣传认真贯彻工会法彻底改变工会工作
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：沈阳市总工会领导干部在中共沈阳市委直接领导下，根据工会法的精神，结合整风，检讨了工会工作，发现如下缺点：第一、关于工会性质方面，大家对“工会是工人阶级自愿结合的群众组织”认识模糊，对职员、技术人员未明确的看成是工人阶级的一部分。因此工会虽已把全市二十一万职工中的百分之六十八（今年六月底统计）组织到工会里来，但对技术人员，职员却没有更积极的吸收。为了强调工会的“纯洁”和先进作用，对新工人强调考察了解，怕其成份复杂。对流动性工人，认为难组织，且组织起来作用不大。把工会工作停留在老干部的圈子里，认为没有老干部派去就无法组织工会或组织起来无法进行工作。因之，机关、文教工会迟迟未组织。而且一般工会的活动，只停留在少数积极分子的狭隘圈子里，没有吸收广大群众参加。第二、工会对面向生产的方针执行不够全面和彻底。一般工会干部虽认识到了要面向生产，某些厂矿工会在领导生产上也做出了较好的成绩；但大多数工会只是一般的号召，没有更进一步深入生产过程，深入车间小组，抓住生产关键，组织力量，积极主动的解决具体问题。同时也有些厂矿工会只注意了生产，而忽视职工生活及劳动条件可能与必需的改善。对完成生产任务的观点往往是片面的，只注意保证数量、对质量、成本缺乏统一认识。在工作中因为党、政、工没有配合好，往往彼此脱节，抵消力量。第三、关于工会组织原则，各工会组织虽然基本上是按民主集中制组织起来的，但委派和官办现象仍相当严重存在。例如工会干部调动工人不知道，新派干部没有选举也不正式通知；另方面，不照会章规定，随便提前或推后改选工会委员会委员的现象也相当普遍。工会委员会不定期召开大会，报告自己的工作和听取工人的批评与建议，有的小组三、四个月不开小组会，甚至有的组长不知组员是谁。对上级决议研究和执行的很差，许多重大问题不报告，对下级的请示报告也不及时批答。
    市总工会在检查出上述问题之后，认为今后的工会工作如不根据工会法的精神从根本上认真求得转变与改善，就不能发挥工会组织的力量，将对经济建设有重大影响。特决定先在科长以上干部整风当中，求得改进与贯彻的办法，同时，并准备通过报纸、广播电台、业余学校、文化馆广泛展开对工会法的宣传。
