Xinhua News Agency, September 22nd: The Third Enlarged Meeting of the Executive Committee of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, convened by the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, concluded on September 18th. Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, delivered a report at the meeting entitled "A Summary of the Work of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation in the Past Year," and proposed that the main tasks of women's work for this winter and next spring are: to respond to Chairman Mao Zedong's call and, together with the people of the whole country, create conditions for achieving a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation. To this end, the focus of women's work for this winter and next spring is: First, to actively carry out women's work in land reform areas; Second, to organize and educate women to participate in various industrial and agricultural productions; Third, to actively mobilize women to participate in the winter literacy campaign; Fourth, to continue to assist the judicial organs of governments at all levels in promoting the Marriage Law; Fifth, to continue to carry out international publicity and liaison work. Based on the report by Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, "On Several Issues Concerning Urban Women's Work," the participants focused on discussing the central content and working methods of urban women's work, the organizational forms of women's masses, the continued consolidation and expansion of the unity of women from all strata, and publicity and educational work. Everyone unanimously agreed that the guideline decided by the First National Women's Congress last year, that "urban women's work should focus on female workers, unite other working women, strive for other strata of women, and mobilize and organize working women to participate in production," is completely correct. In the future, it is necessary to further integrate with reality and continue to implement it.
    Regarding the working methods of women's work in the future, the participants unanimously agreed that the main method is to combine with the central tasks of the local people's government, and carry out work in a step-by-step, focused, and planned manner. The work promoted by the Women's Federation must strive for the assistance of all relevant parties: for work that is under the jurisdiction of other organs but is related to women, the Women's Federation should take the initiative to cooperate and coordinate.
    The meeting unanimously adopted Chairman Cai Chang's report "A Summary of the Work of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation in the Past Year" and "Several Major Work Tasks for This Winter and Next Spring," Vice-Chairman Deng Yingchao's report "On Several Issues Concerning Urban Women's Work," and instructed affiliated organizations to implement them. The meeting also approved in principle the "General Rules for Women's Representative Assemblies" proposed to the conference by Shuai Mengqi, Minister of the Organization Department. In addition, the meeting also passed the "Resolution on Accepting the Resolutions of the International Democratic Women's Federation Council and Executive Committee and Continuing to Expand and Strengthen the Peace Signature Campaign," the "Decision to Postpone the Second National Congress of Chinese Women," and the "Decision on Soliciting Winter Clothing for Disaster Victims in Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, Henan, and Hebei." The meeting also elected Qian Ying and Liao Suhua as members of the Executive Committee of the All-China Women's Federation, and Cairin Namu (Tibetan) as an alternate member of the Executive Committee.

　　全国妇联三次执委扩大会议闭幕
    确定今冬明春妇女工作中心
    【新华社二十二日讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会召开的第三次执委扩大会议已于九月十八日闭幕。全国妇联主席蔡畅在大会作了“全国民主妇联一年来工作概况”的报告，并提出今冬明春妇女工作的主要任务是：响应毛泽东主席的号召，与全国人民一起，创造争取国家财政经济基本好转的条件。为此，今冬明春的妇女工作是：第一，积极开展实行土地改革区的妇女工作；第二，组织教育妇女参加各种工业和农业生产；第三，积极动员妇女参加冬学运动；第四，继续协助各级政府的司法机关推行婚姻法；第五，继续开展国际宣传和联络工作。与会人员根据全国妇联副主席邓颖超“关于城市妇女工作几个问题”的报告，着重讨论了城市妇女工作的中心内容和工作方法、妇女群众的组织形式、继续巩固与扩大各阶层妇女的团结及宣传教育工作等问题。大家一致认为：去年第一次全国妇女代表大会所决定的“城市妇女工作应以女工为主，团结其他劳动妇女争取其他各阶层妇女，发动和组织劳动妇女参加生产”的方针是完全正确的。今后要进一步地与实际结合，继续贯彻。
    关于今后妇女工作的工作方法，与会人员一致认为主要是结合当地人民政府的中心任务，有步骤、有重点、有计划地进行工作。妇联负责推进的工作，必须争取有关各方面的协助：属于其他机关主管而又与妇女有关的工作，妇联应主动配合协同进行。
    会议一致通过了蔡畅主席所作“全国民主妇联一年来工作概况”及“今冬明春的几个主要工作任务”两个报告、邓颖超副主席的“关于城市妇女工作几个问题”的报告，并责成属会付诸执行。会议对原则上通过组织部部长帅梦奇向大会提出的“妇女代表会通则”。此外，会议还通过了“关于接受国际民主妇联理事会与执委会各项决议及继续扩大与加强和平签名运动的决议”、“延期召开中国妇女第二次代表大会的决定”、“关于皖北、苏北、河南、河北灾民寒衣劝募工作的决定”。会议并补选钱瑛、廖苏华为全国妇联执委、才仁那木（藏族）为候补执委。
