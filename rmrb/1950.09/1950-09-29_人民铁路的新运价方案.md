　　New Railway Freight Rate Scheme of the People's Railway
　　Feng Dasheng, Huang Beitian
The formulation of railway freight rates not only relates to the development of the People's Railway cause, but also has a significant impact on the exchange of materials and economic prosperity. This work is arduous and complex, requiring careful and meticulous consideration and research to complete smoothly. In the past, due to a lack of complete statistical materials, insufficient experience, and inadequate absorption of advanced Soviet experience, some areas were out of touch with reality. In addition, due to past price fluctuations, freight rates had to be adjusted frequently with prices to ensure railway revenue. Since the publication of freight classifications in July 1949, there have been five adjustments. This made it impossible to make many considerations in terms of policy control. Besides making some possible modifications, many shortcomings in the freight rates could not be corrected in a timely and appropriate manner. Since the unification of national finance and economy in March of this year, prices have begun to stabilize, and the railway bureau's income and expenditure have approached equilibrium. The economic situation has seen new developments. In order to adapt to the new economic situation, the Ministry of Railways, after several months of in-depth investigation and research, reviewed the shortcomings in past freight rates and re-established this new freight rate scheme. Passenger transport has been implemented since July 15th, and freight transport has been implemented since August 1st.

The main spirit of this new freight rate scheme is to uniformly stipulate and reasonably reduce freight rates on the premise of ensuring railway revenue, especially in terms of cargo classification and freight rate ratios. New revisions have been made, which greatly facilitate the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and between domestic and foreign regions. Now, let's elaborate and briefly explore the passenger and freight aspects of this new scheme.

  I. Passenger Transport

　　Passenger fares have always been lower than before the Anti-Japanese War. To implement the spirit of price reduction and to seek unification and rationality, this time it has been reduced by about 8.7 percent. Before the implementation of the new fare scheme, the base price of passenger tickets varied due to the different economic conditions in the north and south, so the north and south were calculated separately. In May of this year, in order to unify the base price, the southern base price of 135 yuan per person-kilometer was also changed to 115 yuan per person-kilometer in the north, which was uniform in terms of freight rates. However, due to the unsuitability of the progressively decreasing rate, separate calculation was still retained, so unreasonable phenomena occurred in individual sections. At the same time, on-site work also became more difficult. This time, the base price reduction changed from 115 yuan to 105 yuan, and the progressively decreasing rate was revised. The north and south are no longer calculated separately, and the calculation method of passenger transport freight rates is unified.

　　In the past, passenger cars were divided into three classes, with the first-class fare being four times that of the third-class. There were few first-class passengers, and the equipment maintenance fee was large, which caused losses to railway revenue and the use of transportation capacity. In order to absorb the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and reduce the waste of transportation capacity, this time the passenger transport has been changed to a two-level system - soft seat and hard seat. The soft seat fare is twice that of the hard seat.

　　Parcels were originally divided into four levels, two reductions, and one specific, for a total of seven types, which only increased the handling procedures for passengers and railways. In addition, the price rate was high, resulting in a gradual reduction in the amount of transportation. This time, the new method combines the four levels of parcels into ordinary parcels, and separately sets fresh and live parcels, and two kinds of specific parcels. The freight rate for ordinary parcels is 40 yuan per 10 kilograms per kilometer, which is about 32 percent lower than the average price of the original first, second, third, and fourth-level parcels. Fresh and live parcels are set at 15 yuan per 10 kilograms per kilometer to take care of time-sensitive fresh fish, shellfish, and fresh vegetables, with an average reduction of about 34 percent. Specific parcels were originally set up for the transportation of news magazines. The original price was 113 yuan per kilogram regardless of distance. Now it is changed to 4 jiao per kilogram per kilometer. However, in order to implement the spirit of price reduction, fees are still charged according to the past price rate for distances exceeding 280 kilometers, and will not be increased.

　　The original freight rate for luggage was 19 yuan per 10 kilograms per kilometer within 50 kilograms, and 25.5 jiao per 10 kilograms per kilometer for the part exceeding 50 kilograms. The price rate was too high, and passengers could not afford it. It was revised to 10 yuan and 20 yuan respectively, with a reduction of about 47 percent.

　　Regarding the progressively decreasing rate of passenger transport, the degree of decrease at 1,000 kilometers was 21 percent in the past, which was even higher than that of freight transport (the degree of decrease at 1,000 kilometers for freight transport was 16 percent), which was unreasonable. Therefore, after the change, the original maximum degree of decrease of 42 percent was reduced to 37 percent. The progressively decreasing rate of luggage parcels was also reduced to be in line with freight zero-load, and was consistent with the Northeast. The past maximum decrease of 42 percent was changed to 26 percent.

  II. Freight Transport

　　Before July 1949, the classification of goods was to list the names of various goods into a list, which could not include all of them. Moreover, with the increasing development of industry and commerce, the names of new goods increased day by day, thus increasing the difficulties for passengers and on-site staff. The classification table promulgated in July 1949 adopted advanced Soviet methods and classified items scientifically, making it easy to determine the level. This was a major change in the classification. However, due to the initial adoption of various parties not being familiar with it, and the failure to coordinate well with China's economic situation when formulating it, some were not realistic. For example, many domestic goods with large transportation volumes, such as bamboo, rattan, and medicinal materials, were not included. On the contrary, some included goods were rare in China. At the same time, there were some deviations in the classification, such as the level of raw materials being higher than that of finished products. This time, according to the discovered shortcomings, appropriate revisions were made, and some specific cargo names were listed as much as possible under the general cargo names, so that passengers and railway staff could easily understand and determine the level. The original 3 doors, 13 departments, 77 categories, 257 items, and 750 cargo names were changed to 2 doors, 13 departments, 78 categories, 327 items, and 920 cargo names. In addition, the cargo name index table was changed to a cargo name inspection table, and cargo names were added as much as possible to facilitate the search for applicable categories and items for the cargo. Most general cargo is included. The level was increased from 20 levels to 30 levels, which can be unified with the Northeast (the 30-level system has been implemented in the Northeast region since April of this year), and it is easier to make the cargo bear reasonably. The level arrangement is based on the original, linked to reality, based on the feedback from passengers and on-site staff, taking into account both public and private interests and facilitating the exchange of materials, and taking into account the use, nature, value, and affordability of the cargo itself, and rearranged it, which makes the cargo division a step further than before. Due to the different monetary systems and economic conditions in the Northeast and the North and South, the levels of some goods cannot be consistent temporarily, and different levels are still applicable to avoid being constrained.

　　This time, due to the modification of the level and freight rate, the freight rates for general cargo have been universally reduced, especially for many high-level cargo, the reduction is even greater. From the perspective of the base price, the degree of price reduction, such as silk fabrics such as silk, was originally 2,781 yuan per ton-kilometer, which was changed to 1,056 yuan, a reduction of 62 percent; electrical materials were originally 1,928 yuan per ton-kilometer, which was changed to 542 yuan, a reduction of 71.9 percent; newsprint was originally 1,020 yuan per ton-kilometer, which was changed to 368 yuan, a reduction of 63.9 percent; cotton yarn was originally 852 yuan per ton-kilometer, which was changed to 542 yuan, a reduction of 36.4 percent. Looking at the degree of price reduction from the perspective of transportation distance, such as tung oil from Hankou to Tianjin, it decreased by 27.7 percent; salt from Hangu to Hankou decreased by 16.3 percent; coal from Guye to Shanghai decreased by 7.8 percent.

　　Regarding the freight rate for goods, the initial difference between the first-class goods and the twentieth-class goods was 200 times. It was later changed to 25 times in December 1949, but the gap was still too large. This time it was changed to 17 times, that is, the first-class goods are 1,702 yuan per ton-kilometer, and the thirtieth-class goods are 100 yuan per ton-kilometer. The method of increasing the adjacent levels by a percentage is adopted. From the 30th level to the 16th level, each level increases by 10.5 percent; from the 16th level to the 1st level, each level increases by 10 percent. As for the freight rate for zero-load goods, in principle, the cost of intermediate reloading and empty car spaces is much higher than that of whole car transportation. However, under the current economic situation in China, to strengthen the exchange of materials, connect urban and rural transportation, and develop production, we should basically provide assistance. At present, there are relatively few whole-car shipments of goods, except for some agricultural and mineral products such as coal, grain, salt, iron, and timber. Generally, small-capital industrial and commercial products are difficult to collect enough for whole-car shipments. Therefore, the past zero-load freight rate was once the whole-car freight rate, which was reduced and changed to 70 percent of the whole-car freight rate.

　　In the past, the progressively decreasing rate used the cumulative decreasing method. From 110 kilometers to 400 kilometers, the cumulative decrease was 0.3 percent. From 410 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers, the cumulative decrease was 0.5 percent. From 1,010 kilometers to 2,000 kilometers, the cumulative decrease was 0.6 percent. Above 2,010 kilometers, the decreasing degree of 2,000 kilometers shall apply. The degree of decrease for medium distances is small, while the degree of decrease for long distances is too large. However, in the current actual transportation situation, medium-distance cargo accounts for the majority of transportation, so the effect is not great. Therefore, this time the degree of decrease in medium distances is increased, and the calculation method is simplified. The fixed base decreasing method is adopted. The decreasing rate is 10 percent from 210 kilometers to 500 kilometers, 30 percent from 510 kilometers to 1,000 kilometers, 60 percent from 1,010 kilometers to 1,500 kilometers, 70 percent from 1,510 kilometers to 2,000 kilometers, and 40 percent above 2,000 kilometers. The past maximum degree of decrease was 42.6 percent, which is now changed to 41.5 percent.

  III. Other

　　Regarding the freight rates for specific goods, in the past, in addition to import and export goods, and the film machinery and accessories of film touring teams, the photographic equipment of photography teams, and epidemic prevention medicines, temporary reduction special prices were formulated successively to remedy the impact of excessive freight rates on the exchange of materials, such as cement, oxygen, fresh fruits, automobiles, porcelain, bamboo, rice, and white flour. Most of them were temporary measures. After the adjustment of the grade freight rates this time, the above-mentioned goods have been adjusted in grade, and the freight has been reduced, so there is no need to retain them, so they are all cancelled. In addition to the original import and export special prices, touring teams, photography teams, film, photography equipment, and epidemic prevention medicines, the newly set special prices include the newly added "return empty special price," which takes into account the convenience of cargo owners. The railway shall not charge freight for the return of cargo owners' own trucks, such as tarpaulins, ropes, mats, and supports, to the starting station. Other empty containers for loading goods, such as barrels, cans, and boxes, can also be returned to the starting station at half price at the request of the cargo owner. The export materials are divided into two types: a 50% reduction and a 30% reduction, distinguishing their importance to the national economy and various related conditions. At the same time, in order to facilitate passengers and on-site work, the reduced special price for Beijing special handicrafts is changed to a fixed level. The original reduction of 40% is changed to calculation at the 13th level.

　　Lightweight zero-load goods are subject to volume conversion, which not only avoids empty vehicles, but also encourages reasonable packaging. Originally, according to the statistical results of various countries, it was handled by converting each cubic meter into 300 kilograms. In December 1949, due to the excessive difference in grades, in order to reduce the burden of zero-load goods, it was temporarily changed to convert each cubic meter into 200 kilograms. Now the difference in grades has been reduced, and the freight rate has also been reduced, so it is still restored to the calculation of 300 kilograms per cubic meter. In the past, the freight rate for whole-car goods was calculated based on the technical loading capacity. Due to the lack of investigation and statistical data and the large number of vehicle types, disputes often occurred. At the same time, the railway suffered excessive losses when charging fees based on actual loading. For example, if 30-ton cars are loaded with 7 tons of straw, only 7 tons of freight will be charged. The advanced Soviet technical loading capacity only plays a role in reasonable loading of cars, and is not related to the calculation of freight. The whole-car goods are charged per car. China's conditions are not sufficient, and the Soviet experience cannot be fully absorbed. Therefore, the minimum tonnage of 15 tons (30-ton marked load car) is specified. Even so, the railway revenue is still not as favorable as transporting general low-level goods. For example, straw is the 22nd level, and charging fees at 15 tons is only 91% of a carload of 28th level goods. A carload of waste paper is the 25th level, and charging fees at the 15th level is only 83% of a carload of 30th level goods. In the future, once the conditions are ripe, further improvements will be needed in this area.

　　In order to recover the minimum ticket fee and handling fee, the minimum weight of zero-load goods is 50 kilograms, and the minimum freight is 3,000 yuan. In order to recover the minimum cost, the minimum freight for whole-car is 204,000 yuan, which is equivalent to the freight for 50 kilometers of 27th level whole-car goods.

　　In the past, there were many items of miscellaneous fees and fines, and the fee rates were too high (such as shunting fees). In order to reduce the burden on cargo owners, after consideration and research, the nature was distinguished, the fees were generally reduced, and seven unnecessary fees were cancelled, including weighing fees, animal storage fees, minimum storage fees, handling fees for transporting or delivering goods on dedicated lines and cargo branch lines, arrival notice handling fees, fines for insufficient technical loading capacity, and fines for insufficient capacity.

　　The above is the general outline of this revision of freight rates. Due to the promulgation of the new freight rate scheme, the unreasonable aspects of the past freight rates have been significantly adjusted. Under the spirit of implementing price reductions, the deviations caused by the original excessively high levels have been reasonably corrected. However, due to the limitations of objective reality, the new scheme is not completely without shortcomings. For example, the progressively decreasing rate is limited to not exceeding the original freight rate, so it is not敢放手去做。 Therefore, in the future, we must conduct investigations and research at any time, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and find ways to make various adjustments in a timely manner according to the development of the economic situation, so that the freight rate policy of the People's Railway can play its greatest role in developing production and promoting economic prosperity.

　　人民铁路的新运价方案
    冯大生　黄悲天
    铁路运价的制定，不但关系人民铁路事业的发展，并且特别对于物资的交流，经济的繁荣，有很大影响。这一工作是很艰巨，很繁杂的，需要谨慎，细致的考虑与研究，才能顺利完成。过去因为缺乏完备统计材料，经验不够，对吸收先进苏联的经验也作的不够好，以致有些地方脱离实际。加以过去物价波动，为了保证路收，运价订定不能不时时随物价而调整，自一九四九年七月运价货等公布以后，曾先后调整了五次，致在政策掌握上不能作很多考虑，除作了些可能的修改，运价上所存在着的许多缺点，不能及时的恰当的改正。自本年三月全国财经统一以来，物价开始稳定，路局收支也接近平衡，经济情况有了新的发展，为求适应新的经济情况，中央铁道部经过了几个月的深入调查和研究，检讨了过去运价中的缺点，才重新厘订了这次的新运价方案，客运自七月十五日起实行，货运自八月一日起实行。
    这次新运价方案制定的主要精神，是在保证路收的前提下，统一规定，合理减低运价，特别是在货物分等和运价比率上面，作了新的修正，大大有利于城乡、内外物资的交流。现就这次新方案的客运和货运两方面，加以阐述并略作探讨。
  一、客运
    客运票价一直是比抗战前为低，为贯彻减价精神，并求统一合理，此次约减低了百分之八点七。新运价方案实行以前，因北南方经济情况不同，客票基价各异，所以北南方分算。本年五月间为了统一基价，南方每人公里一三五元亦改按北方每人公里一一五元计算，在运价上是划一了。但因递远递减率的不适合，仍保留分算，因此在个别区段，就发生了不合理的现象。同时现场工作上，也增加困难。这次减价基价自一一五元改为一○五元，修正了递远递减率，北南方不再分算，统一了客运运价的计算方法。
    过去客车分三个等级，一等票价为三等的四倍，一等旅客少，设备保养费大，对于铁路收入和运输力使用，都造成损失。为吸收苏联先进经验，减少运输力之浪费，这次已将客运改为两级制——软席、硬席，软席票价为硬席的二倍。
    包裹原分四个等级、两个减成和一个特定，计七种，徒增加了客商及铁路的办理手续，加之价率高，致运送数量，日益减少。这次新办法即归并四个等级的包裹为普通包裹，另定鲜活包裹，特定包裹两种，普通包裹运价每十公斤每公里四十元，较原来一、二、三、四级包裹平均价，减低百分之三十二；鲜活包裹为照顾有时间性的鲜鱼介鲜蔬菜等，定为每十公斤每公里十五元，平均约减低百分之三十四；特定包裹原为运送新闻杂志而设，原定不分远近距离每公斤一一三元，现改为每公斤每公里四角，但为贯彻减价精神，超过二八○公里仍按过去价率收费，不予增加。
    行李运价原定五十公斤内每十公斤每公里十九元，超过五十公斤对其超过部分每十公斤每公里二十五元五角，价率过高，旅客负担不起，经分别改定为十元与二十元，约减低百分之四十七。
    关于客运的递远递减率，过去递减程度在一千公里时为百分之二十一，较之货运尤高（货运一千公里递减程度为百分之十六）不合理，故更改后自原递减程度最大百分之四十二缩减为百分之三十七。行李包裹递远递减率，为与货运零担联系，亦均分别改小，并与东北取得一致，递远递减程度过去最大递减为百分之四十二改为百分之二十六。
  二、货运
    货物分等在一九四九年七月以前，是将各种货物的名称，列成表册，既不能全部包括，复以工商业日益发展，新货物名称日增，于是增加客商及现场方面的困难。一九四九年七月公布的分等表系采取苏联进步办法，按科学分类及项，易于判定等级，这是分等方面的一大变革。但由于初期采用各方多不熟习，且制定时未能很好的配合我国经济情况，致有些不切实际，如许多国产而运输量很大的货物如竹、藤、药材等均未列入；反之有些列入的货物，则又为我国所不常见，同时在定等方面也有些偏差，如原料的等级高于成品等，这次根据已发现的上项缺点，作适当的修正，将笼统的货名下，尽量罗列一些具体货名，使客商及路员均易于了解，易于判定等级。原定三门十三部七七类二五七项七五○个货名，改为二门十三部七八类三二七项九二○个货名。另外货物品名索引表改为货物品名检查表，尽量增加货名，以便查找货物适用的类项，一般货物大部包括在内。等级由二十个等级增为三十个，既可与东北统一（东北区管内在本年四月起实行三十等制），更易于使货物负担合理。等级排列以原定为基础，联系实际，根据客商及现场的反映，以公私兼顾及便利物资交流为原则，并照顾到货物本身的用途、性质、价值、负担能力等条件，重新加以排列，这就使货等划分较前更进了一步。为了东北和北南方的币制和经济情况不同，有些货物的等级暂时还不能一致，仍适用不同的等级，免受牵制。
    这次因等级及运价率的修改，一般货物的运价均普遍的降低了，尤其是许多高等级的货物，减的更多。从基价上来看减价程度，如绸缎等丝织品，原每吨公里二七八一元改为一○五六元，减低百分之六二；电料原每吨公里一九二八元改为五四二元，减低百分之七一点九；白报纸原每吨公里为一○二○元改为三六八元，减低百分之六三点九；棉纱原每吨公里为八五二元改为五四二元，减低百分之三六点四。再由运程方面来看减价程度，如桐油自汉口至天津减低了百分之二七点七；盐自汉沽至汉口减低百分之一六点三；煤由古冶至上海减低了百分之七点八。
    关于货物运价率，最初一等货与二十等货等差为二○○倍，嗣于一九四九年十二月改为二五倍，仍感差距过大，这次改为十七倍，计一等货每吨公里一七○二元，三十等货每吨公里一○○元，采用邻等百分比递加办法。自三十等至十六等每等递加百分之一○点五；十六等至一等每等递加百分之一○。至于零担货物运价，在原则方面，因中途换装，虚糜车位，较整车输送的成本高的很多。但是在我国现阶段经济情况之下，为加强物资交流，沟通城乡运输，发展生产，应由基本上予以扶助。现在整车输送货物，除一些农矿产品如煤、粮、盐、铁、木材等外，其他货物是比较少的，而一般小资本工商业产品，很难凑足整车托运，因此将过去零担运价为整车运价之一倍，减低改按整车价率加百分之七十。
    递远递减率过去用累加递减法，由一一○公里至四○○公里，累加递减百分之零点三，自四一○公里至一○○○公里累加递减百分之零点五，自一○一○公里至二○○○公里累加递减百分之零点六，二○一○公里以上按二○○○公里递减程度。使中距离减的少，而长距离减的过多，但是现在实际运输情况，中距离货物占运输的大部分，这样所发生的作用不大。故这次加大了中距离的递减程度，简化计算方法，采用了固定基数递减法，自二一○公里至五○○公里递减率为百分之十，五一○公里至一○○○公里递减率为百分之三○，一○一○公里至一五○○公里递减率为百分之六○，一五一○公里至二○○○公里递减率为百分之七○，二○○○公里以上为百分之四○·递减程度过去最大递减为百分之四二点六，现改为百分之四一点五。
  三、其他
    关于特定货物运价，过去除出入口货物，及电影巡回放映队的电影机械及附属品、摄影队的摄影器材、防疫药品等外，临时为补救运价过高影响物资交流，曾先后制定了减成特价，如洋灰，氧气，鲜水果，汽车，磁器，竹，大米，白面等，大部为临时性措施。这次等级运价调整后，上述货物均调整了等级，运费已减低，无保留之必要，故均取消。新定的特价除原有之出入口特价，巡回放映队摄影队，电影、摄影器材，防疫药品等外，新加了“回空特价”，系照顾货主的便利，对货主自备之货车用具，如篷布，绳索，席子，支柱等运回起运站，铁路免收运费，其他装货之空容器如桶、罐、箱等，亦可应货主之要求，半价运回起运站。对出口物资区别其对于国家经济的重要性及各种有关条件，改为减五成及减三成两种，同时为了便利客商及现场工作，将北京特种手工艺品的减成特价，改为固定等级，原为减百分之四○，改为按十三等计费。
    轻浮零担货物，实行容积换算，既免虚糜车辆，且收鼓励合理包装之效，原系根据各国统计结果，按每一立方公尺折合三百公斤办理，在一九四九年十二月因等差过大，为了减轻零担货物担负，临时改为每一立方公尺折合二百公斤，现等差已缩小，运价亦减低，故仍恢复一立方公尺折合三百公斤计费。过去整车货物计算运价，按技术装载量计算，因调查统计资料缺乏，车辆种类太多，故时生纠葛，同时按实装计费，铁路损失过巨，如装稻草用三十吨车装载七吨，仅收七吨运费。苏联先进的技术装载量仅起合理装车作用，并不与计算运费关联，其整车货物是按车收费的，我国条件不够，尚不能全部吸收苏联经验，因此规定出起码吨数十五吨（三十吨标记载重车）。虽然如此，铁路收入，仍不及运送一般低级货物为有利。例如稻草为二十二级，按十五吨收费，只当一车二十八等货的百分之九一，一车乱纸为二十五等，按十五等收费，只当一车三十等货的百分之八三。将来一俟条件成熟，这方面还需要再作进一步的改进。
    为了收回最低限度的票据费及手续费，零担货物规定起码重量为五十公斤，起码运费为三千元，整车为了收回最低成本费用，规定起码运费为二十万零四千元，相当整车货物二十七等五十公里的运费。
    过去杂费及罚款名目繁多，费率过高（如调车费），为减轻货主负担，经考虑研究后，分别性质，普遍减低，并取消了不必要的费用七种，计过秤费、动物保管费、起码保管费，专用线及货物支线承运或交付货物手续费，到货通知手续费，不足技术装载量罚款，不足容量罚款，均予取消。
    以上所述，就是这次改定运价的大致轮廓。由于运价新方案的颁订，过去运价上不合理的地方，已有了重大的调整，在贯彻减价的精神下，原定等级过高而发生的偏向，都已获得合理纠正。但新方案因为客观现实的限制，也不是完全没有缺点的。如递远递减率，即因限于不超过原有运价，致不敢放手去做。所以，今后还必须随时作调查和研究，学习苏联先进经验，视经济的发展情势，设法及时作各种调整，使人民铁路的运价政策，能在发展生产、繁荣经济中发挥其最大的作用。
