　　China Youth Art Theater
    Will Stage "How Steel Was Tempered"
    The Theater to Recruit Twenty Actors and Twenty Dancers
    The China Youth Art Theater is scheduled to stage "How Steel Was Tempered," written by the famous Soviet writer Nikolai Ostrovsky, at the Capital Youth Palace on September 12th. The play depicts the life of Pavel Korchagin, an outstanding member of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League. His noble Bolshevik qualities and the great revolutionary heroism of self-sacrifice are not only loved by the youth of the entire Soviet Union, but also have a profound impact on progressive youth around the world. Due to the educational role of this novel on the broad masses of Soviet youth, the Soviet government and the Party awarded Ostrovsky the Order of Lenin in 1936. The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League has specifically instructed the theater to perform this play, which has profound significance for the fighting and construction of Chinese youth today. It is reported that the director of this play is Comrade Sun Weishi, who has returned from studying at the Moscow Art Theater. The main actors include Jin Shan, Wu Xue, Zhang Ruifang, and others.
    In addition, in order to meet the needs of its work, the theater has decided to recruit a group of students. The recruitment quota is: twenty members for the actor team and twenty members for the dance team. Application qualifications: Actor team applicants must be high school graduates, aged between eighteen and twenty-five, and physically strong; dance team applicants must have at least two years of high school education and be under twenty years of age. The duration of study is three years. If the performance is excellent, they can participate in work ahead of schedule. During the study period, the theater provides food and accommodation and waives all tuition and miscellaneous fees. Those with excellent academic performance may also be given appropriate subsidies. Application date: September 5th to 12th. Address: No. 345, Dongdan Chongnei Avenue. Application procedures: Applicants must have educational certificates, two recent half-length photos, and a letter of introduction from an organization or school above the district level.
