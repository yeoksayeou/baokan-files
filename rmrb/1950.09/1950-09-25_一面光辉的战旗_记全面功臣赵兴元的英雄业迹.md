　　A Glorious Banner
    ——On the Heroic Deeds of All-Round Meritorious Person Zhao Xingyuan
    Xiao Hang
    It is very difficult to write down Zhao Xingyuan's heroic deeds in their entirety. He is such a hero: making meritorious contributions in everything, year after year. From 1939 to 1950, from a soldier promoted to deputy regimental commander, he has been fighting on the front lines, wounded nine times, with a piece of shrapnel still in his calf. For more than ten years, he has made five major contributions to the Chinese people with his blood, sweat, and wisdom, one special contribution in combat, and one special contribution and one major contribution in peacetime work. He has been elected as a combat hero, model youth captain, model political work cadre, and all-round meritorious person. Therefore, he is honorably called "a glorious banner that never fades" by the entire division. Now, the entire combat hero representatives of the Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army have elected him as the captain of the hero team to lead the team to attend the National Combat Hero Representatives Conference.
    The commanders and fighters who fought alongside Zhao Xingyuan are all clearly aware of his distinct characteristics: he is good at taking decisive steps in decisive battles and cleverly defeating any stubborn enemy. From this, people can easily see his endless courage and wisdom.
    It was October 1948, the last battle in the Northeast—the Jinzhou Campaign. Zhao Xingyuan, who was then the battalion commander, and his First Battalion, were assigned the task of capturing the strong fortified stronghold on the periphery of Jinzhou—the Water Distribution Station.
    The Water Distribution Station was the northern gate of Jinzhou. It controlled a wide avenue leading to Jinzhou City, and three divisions of our army had to pass through this avenue to attack Jinzhou. As a barrier to the north of Jinzhou, it blocked our army's bombardment of the north city. The reason why we had to first seize the Water Distribution Station was also because it was located on high ground and could overlook the enemy's artillery positions, command headquarters, and the enemy's deployment and movement within the city. For such a stronghold, the Kuomintang bandit army had been continuously building and reinforcing it on the basis of the industrial foundations originally built by the Japanese invaders since they entered the Northeast in 1945. By 1948, they already felt that this was an insurmountable golden city. Therefore, they arrogantly wrote on the building of the Water Distribution Station: "The Water Distribution Station is the Second Verdun!" This confidence was strengthened by what they considered their "strong" defensive force. The defending force was a reinforced company, a heavy machine gun company, and a heavy anti-tank artillery platoon. The soldiers in each unit were all selected "old soldiers" with more than four years of military service. They boasted that "those who guard the Water Distribution Station are all iron men." At that time, the front-line commander personally inspected the front line and determined that the battle for the Water Distribution Station was the key battle of the Jinzhou Campaign. And he pointed out that such a stronghold, although relatively easy to break into, was also difficult to defend, and the enemy would definitely do everything possible to counterattack desperately. However, holding the Water Distribution Station was a prerequisite for capturing Jinzhou; and the capture of Jinzhou could not only quickly end the Northeast War, but also greatly shorten the time of the national war. This was the hope of the 475 million people across the country.
    Zhao Xingyuan had a deep understanding of this, and he was known throughout the division for having a clear and firm strategic concept.
    The battle began. As the front-line commander had predicted, when the First Battalion had just entered the Water Distribution Station, the enemy launched a fierce counterattack while our army had not yet gained a firm foothold: three tanks, two bombers, and the artillery fire of the entire city of Jinzhou attacked the Water Distribution Station together. The battle was so fierce that the Water Distribution Station had been reflected into a red expanse by fire and blood in the First Battalion's repelling of the enemy's more than thirty counterattacks. From noon to night, eight hours of bloody battle, there were casualties every minute.
    It was during the fierce and difficult battle that Zhao Xingyuan appeared on the front line. Immediately, a cheer from the soldiers rose on the position: "The battalion commander is here, we will definitely win, keep calm!"
    Zhao Xingyuan calmed himself down and found that less than half of the commanders of the four companies were left, and they had all left their designated positions, and our lineup was obviously chaotic.
    "We must not meet chaos with chaos, if the enemy is in chaos, we must not be in chaos!" Zhao Xingyuan said at an emergency temporary cadre meeting: "We are all Communist Party members, we must firmly hold the position!" After the company commanders expressed their determination, they turned and rushed to their designated positions. Here, Zhao Xingyuan entered the trench.
    In the trench, more than a hundred wounded soldiers lay scattered. The seriously wounded signalman Fan Junqing raised his eyes and looked at his battalion commander with attachment: "I'm done, battalion commander, you must complete the task well!" Another wounded soldier cared about Zhao Xingyuan's hunger and lamely handed over a bag of food: "Battalion commander, are you hungry?" Indeed, Zhao Xingyuan was hungry. He picked up the dry food but couldn't eat it. Looking at the fallen comrades, looking at Fan Junqing's gray and yellow face, tears rolled down his firm face. In the year that followed, every time he picked up a bowl of rice, he clearly recalled Fan Junqing's dying words, which greatly encouraged his enthusiasm for fighting and working. At that time, he had only one thought: to avenge the class brothers who had been wounded and killed. He firmly said to the wounded: "With me here, you are safe." He encouraged everyone: "Our battalion has always been a heroic unit, now is the time to show our backbone role. Comrades, the lightly wounded charge forward!" Following the battalion commander's shouts, more than thirty lightly wounded soldiers rushed towards the enemy. Zhao Xingyuan excitedly saw that the soldiers' strong fighting spirit was not injured. He was deeply moved and rushed to the front of the soldiers. However, a soldier pulled his belt, and two other soldiers hugged his waist and legs: "Battalion commander, you can't go up, the entire battalion relies on you." Zhao Xingyuan turned around, and the four people hugged each other. He felt: "The love of class comrades is profound." But he turned around and rushed up again.
    The enemy's counterattacks were so fierce and continuous. The First Battalion's grenades were used up, and the bullets were about to run out. What was even more serious was that the rear route had been cut off by the enemy, and they were already in a dangerous situation with no ammunition and no reinforcements. The regimental leader urgently inquired on the phone: "Can you hold on?" At this time, Zhao Xingyuan thought of the front-line commander's instructions, the Party's ten years of cultivation, and the fallen comrades. He thought: the superior had taught that it was precisely in the most urgent times that he needed to stand up. He thought: in order to complete the task, in order to avenge the sacrificed comrades, and for the safety of these hundred or so wounded soldiers, he must hold the position. Therefore, he resolutely replied to the regimental leader: "I will definitely hold on!" Therefore, he cleverly organized the unarmed comrades to pick up the enemy's ammunition to ensure a constant supply of ammunition, and defeated the enemy's final counterattack. Finally, in the vast twilight, Zhao Xingyuan organized five uninjured comrades to cooperate with the fraternal units of the Third Battalion to capture the gateway to Jinzhou—the Water Distribution Station.
    Zhao Xingyuan's combat merits are difficult to finish writing. He performed very well in the Mengjia Village battle in Linyi, Shandong in the winter of 1945. Mengjia Village was the last stronghold of the enemy in southern Shandong, and as a springboard, the enemy attempted to rely on it to respond to hundreds of thousands of Kuomintang bandit troops attacking Shandong. Although we had fought for twenty-five days, we had not opened a breakthrough. The enemy's fortifications were strong and cleverly built. At this time, the bullet that had shot into Zhao Xingyuan's right hand had not been taken out, the gunshot wound had festered, and it was impossible to hold a gun. However, he did not leave the battlefield, but pondered in front of the position, worried so much that he couldn't sleep, and smoked eight or nine packs of cigarettes overnight, hoping to find a way to break through. Finally, our army entered Mengjia Village along the gap of more than two zhang wide that Zhao Xingyuan had blown open, and successfully resolved the battle. In the Lanshan battle in Liuhe County, Liaodong, a foot injury forced Zhao Xingyuan to ride a donkey quietly to the position. He cleverly and bravely led the team to occupy a hill, which was enough to control the enemy's life and death, but the enemy had not yet had time to occupy it. The enemy attempted to use four mountain cannons to bomb them back, but these four mountain cannons were captured by Zhao Xingyuan with a squad. The enemy's entire line was shaken. After the battle ended, Zhao Xingyuan rode the animal again. There are many such deeds; however, Zhao Xingyuan's deeds are not only manifested on the battlefield, he is an all-round meritorious person.
    A moving story happened in the summer of 1947. Zhou Wanchun, the squad leader who had fought alongside Zhao Xingyuan for a long time, was wounded in the head in the Nanshanchengzi battle in Qingyuan, Liaodong. Because his nerves were disordered, he was tied to a stretcher and carried off the battlefield. He kept shouting: "Instructor, I'm sorry for you, I didn't complete the task!" "Instructor, give me a task!" He shouted like this for seven days until he died.
    When Zhou Wanchun was shooting at the enemy on the position, he caught a glimpse of Zhao Xingyuan, and he said: "Deputy Instructor, don't worry, I'm here, the position is here." He had expressed such determination to Zhao Xingyuan twice. Another time was when Zhao Xingyuan was promoted from company instructor to deputy political instructor. At the farewell party, Zhou Wanchun thought of the education and care that Zhao Xingyuan had given him: when he first became a squad leader, a soldier nicknamed "King of Strange Talk" Li Zhenfang caused great difficulties in the leadership of the squad, and it was Zhao Xingyuan who helped transform Li Zhenfang. Over the years, Zhao Xingyuan told him stories during every march; and told him about the Party Constitution on the nights of camping. More than once, when he was sound asleep, Zhao Xingyuan quietly took off his leather shoes to let him rest well. Several years of comradeship made him feel that suddenly leaving Zhao Xingyuan was like losing his reliance. He said: "Instructor, for several years, we have been like real brothers, from when I was a signalman, you trained me to be a squad leader. I will never forget your kindness. I have nothing to repay you, I can only make more meritorious contributions in battle and ensure that I lead the entire squad to complete the tasks assigned by the superior." The next day, Zhou Wanchun set off to participate in the Nanshanchengzi battle. He did not violate his oath. Because of his and his comrades' fearlessness of bloodshed and sacrifice, the Nanshanchengzi battle was successfully resolved.
    Zhao Xingyuan is an example for everyone in battle, a famous model in work, and so caring for his comrades in life, while he himself is so arduous. He has made arduous contributions because of this. He suffered from malignant malaria for several years and never stayed in the hospital, but "endured" it. When his hands and feet were injured and unable to move, he sat on the pit to conduct individual education for the soldiers. In any case, he would find an opportunity to work, which easily reminded people of Paul Korchagin's selfless spirit. He moved the soldiers too deeply.
    What is the source of Zhao Xingyuan's courage, perseverance, and wisdom? When he reported his deeds in Hankou on September 15, he answered this question frankly: "I was born into a poor peasant family, joined the army at the age of sixteen, and joined the Party at the age of seventeen. For ten years, the Party's cultivation and education of me has been deeply imprinted in my heart: when there was no way to work, the Party helped me overcome the difficulties; when I had ideological burdens, the Party helped me get rid of them; when I was sick, the Party treated me... I am thinking all the time: how to answer the Party's cultivation of me? I am a soldier, I dedicate my body to the Party. I feel that it is great and glorious to do something for the people."

　　一面光辉的战旗
    ——记全面功臣赵兴元的英雄业迹
    萧航
    要想原原本本地写下赵兴元的英雄业迹，那是很困难的事情。他是这样一个英雄：事事立功，年年立功。从一九三九年到一九五零年，从战士被提拔为副团长，一直战斗在最前线，先后负伤九次，至今还有一块弹片留在小腿里。十多年来，他以自己的血汗和智慧，为中国人民立下了五大战功，一次战斗特功，并且在平时工作中立了一次特功，一次大功。曾当选为战斗英雄，模范青年队长，模范政治工作干部，全面功臣。因此，他被全师荣誉地称为“一面永不褪色的光辉战旗”。现在，中南军区暨第四野战军的全体战斗英雄代表，推选他为英雄队的队长，带队出席全国战斗英雄代表会议。
    和赵兴元战斗在一起的指战员们，全清楚地知道他的鲜明特色：善于在决定性的战斗中采取决定性的步骤，机智地制胜任何顽敌。从这里，人们最容易看出他那无尽的勇敢和智慧。
    是一九四八年的十月，东北的最后一战——锦州战役展开了。在当时还是营长的赵兴元，和他率领的第一营，接受了攻取锦州外围强固据点——配水池的任务。
    配水池是锦州北面的大门。它控制着通往锦州城的一条宽阔大道，我军有三个师的兵力，正必须经此大道进击锦州。作为锦州北城的屏障，它阻挡着我军对北城的炮轰。我们之所以必须首先夺占配水池，还因为它居高临下，可以俯瞰城内敌人的炮兵阵地、指挥部以及敌军的部署和运动。对于这样一个据点，国民党匪军从一九四五年进入东北起，就在日本强盗原筑的工业基础上，一直继续修筑、加固。到一九四八年，他们已经觉得这是一座不可逾越的金城。于是，在配水池的大楼上，狂妄地写道：“配水池是第二凡尔登！”这种自信，又被他们自认为“强大”的守备兵力所加强。守备的兵力是一个加强连，一个重机枪连，一个重战防炮排。各单位的士兵，全是挑选的四年以上军龄的“老兵油子”。他们自吹“守配水池的都是铁打汉”。当时，前线指挥员亲自作了前线视察之后判定：配水池的战斗，是锦州战役的关键性的战斗。并且指示，这样一个虽然比较容易攻入的据点，也是不易坚守的据点，敌人一定会倾其全力拚命反扑。但是，坚守配水池，却是攻占锦州的前提；而锦州的攻占，不仅能够迅速结束东北战争，也将会大大缩短全国战争的时间。这，正是全国四万七千五百万人民的希望。
    对于这一层，赵兴元有着深切的了解，他素以有明确而牢固的战役观念著称全师。
    战斗开始了。正如前线指挥员所预料的，当第一营刚刚攻入配水池的时候，敌人就乘我军立足未稳，组织了凶猛的反扑：三辆战车，两架轰炸机，锦州全城的炮火，一齐向配水池冲击。战斗激烈到这样的程度：在第一营击退敌军三十多次的反扑中，配水池已经为火和血映成一片赤红。自午至夜，血战八小时，每一分钟都有伤亡。
    正是战斗激烈而艰难地进行之际，赵兴元出现于最前线。登时，阵地上扬起一片战士的欢呼声：“营长来啦，我们一定能胜利，沉住气呵！”
    赵兴元定一定神，发现四个连的指挥员剩下不足一半了，而且又全离开了指定的位置，我们的阵容显然混乱起来。
    “决不能以乱对乱，敌人乱了，我们决不能乱！”赵兴元在紧急的临时干部会上说：“我们都是共产党员，必须牢牢地守住阵地！”各连指挥员在表示了决心之后，转身奔向指定的位置。这里，赵兴元进入战壕。
    战壕里，散乱地躺着百多名伤员。重伤的通信员范俊卿抬起眼睛，依恋地望望自己的营长：“我完啦，营长，你好好完成任务！”另一个伤员关怀着赵兴元的饥困，拐着腿把粮袋子递过来：“营长，你饿啦。”的确，赵兴元是饿了，他拿起干粮，却吃不下去，看看躺下去的战友，看看范俊卿的灰黄脸色，眼泪从坚毅的面孔上滚下来。在此后一年的时间内，每当端起饭碗的时候，他就清晰地忆起范俊卿的临终嘱告，这曾大大地鼓舞了他战斗和工作的热情。而在当时，他只有一个念头：给伤亡的阶级弟兄复仇。他坚定地向着伤员：“有我，就有你们的安全。”他鼓动大家：“我们营从来是英雄部队，现在，正是表现我们骨干作用的时候。同志们，轻伤的向前冲呵！”跟随着营长的喊声，三十多个轻伤员扑向敌人。赵兴元激动地看到：战士们旺盛的战志没有负伤。他受了深切的感动，冲向了战士的前面。可是，一个战士拉住了他的皮带，另外的两个战士，抱住了他的腰和腿：“营长，你不能上去，全营就依靠你。”赵兴元扭过身来，四个人拥抱在一起。他感到：“阶级的战友之爱是深沉的。”但是，他转了一个弯子，又冲上去了。
    敌人的反扑是如此的凶猛而又连续不断。第一营的手榴弹却又打光了，子弹眼看也要打完了，更严重的是后路早被敌人切断，他们已经处在弹尽援绝的危境。团首长在电话上急迫地探询：“能不能守住？”这时，赵兴元想起了前线指挥员的指示，想起了党的十年培育，想起了倒下去的战友。他想：上级教导过，正是最紧急的时候，正是需要自己挺身而出的时候。他想：为了完成任务，为了给牺牲的战友复仇，为了这百多名伤员的安全，必须守住阵地。于是，他果决地回答团首长：“我一定守住！”于是，他机敏地组织起徒手的同志，拣拾敌人的弹药，保证弹药的源源供应，击垮了敌人的最后反扑。最终，在一片苍茫的暮色中，赵兴元组织起未伤的五个同志，配合三营的兄弟部队，攻占了锦州的门户——配水池。
    赵兴元的战斗勋迹是很难写完的。他在一九四五年冬天的山东临沂孟家村战斗中，表现得十分出色。孟家村是鲁南敌人的最后据点，作为一个跳板，敌人企图赖以接应几十万国民党匪军袭入山东。我们虽然打了二十五天，却没有打开一个突破口，敌人的工事坚固而修筑得巧妙。这时，射入赵兴元右手的子弹还没有取出来，枪伤化脓了，拿枪是不可能的了。但是，他没有离开战场，却在阵前苦思着，愁得睡不着觉，一夜曾吸了八、九包纸烟，希望找到一个轰开突破口的方法。最终，我军沿着赵兴元炸开的两丈多宽的缺口进入孟家村，胜利地解决了战斗。在辽东六合县的兰山战斗中，脚伤使赵兴元只能悄悄地骑着毛驴走上阵地。他机智而猛勇地带队攻占了一个山头，这是一个足以制敌死命而敌人还没有来得及占领的山头。敌人企图用四门山炮轰退他们，而这四门山炮，却被赵兴元带着一个班夺获了。敌人全线动摇。战斗结束之后，赵兴元又骑上了牲口。像这样的事迹是极多的；但是，赵兴元的事迹，并不仅仅表现在战场上，他是全面功臣。
    一个动人的故事发生在一九四七年的夏天。曾和赵兴元长期并肩作战的班长周万春，在辽东清源南山城子战斗中头部负伤，因为神经已经错乱，他被绑在担架上抬下战场。他不休地呼喊着：“指导员，我对不起你，我没有完成任务啊！”“指导员，你给我任务吧！”他这样呼喊了七天，直到死去。
    还是当周万春在阵地上射击敌人的时候，他瞥见了赵兴元，他说：“副指导员，你放心，我在，阵地在。”这样的决心他曾向赵兴元表示过两次了。另一次是在赵兴元由连指导员升任副教导员的时候。在欢送会上，周万春想起了赵兴元给自己的教育和关怀：当自己初任班长的时候，一个绰号叫做“怪话大王”的战士李振方，使班的领导工作发生了极大的困难，是赵兴元帮助改造了李振方。几年来，每次行军当中，赵兴元全给自己讲故事；在宿营的夜晚，给讲党章。曾是不止一次，当自己熟睡的时候，赵兴元悄悄给脱掉皮鞋，让好好休息。几年的战友之谊，使他觉得骤然离开赵兴元，如同失掉了依靠。他说：“指导员，好几年了，咱们和亲兄弟一样，从我当通信员，培养我当了班长。你的好处，我永远忘不掉。我没有什么可报答你的，我只能在战斗中多立几个功，保证带领全班，完成上级给的任务。”第二天，周万春出发参加南城子战斗，他没有违背自己的誓言，由于他以及他的战友的不怕流血牺牲，使南城子战斗胜利地解决了。
    赵兴元在战斗中是大家的榜样，在工作上是出名的模范，在生活上又是如此的关怀同志，自己却是如此的艰苦，他已经因此立过艰苦功。他害了几年的恶性疟疾，没有住过医院，是“挺”过来的。当手足因伤不能动弹的时候，坐在坑上对战士进行个别教育。在任何情况下他也会找到工作的机会，这很容易使人想起保尔·柯察金的忘我精神来。他给战士的感动太深了。
    赵兴元勇敢、坚毅、智慧的源泉是什么呢？当九月十五日他在汉口报告自己的事迹时，明快地回答了这个问题：“我是贫农出身，十六岁参军，十七岁入党。十年来，党对我的培养，教育，深印在我的心里：当工作没有办法的时候，党帮助我克服了困难；当思想上有了包袱的时候，党帮助我摆脱掉；当我害病的时候，党给我治疗……我时时刻刻在想：如何回答党对我的培育？我是战士，我把身体献给党。我觉得为人民作成一件事情，是伟大而光荣的。”
