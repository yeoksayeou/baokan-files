Xinhua News Agency, 4th. U.S. reactionary magazine "Time Magazine", published on August 21, carried a lengthy report titled "The Ugly War" written by its correspondent in Korea, Osborne. Osborne began by admitting that the inhuman and barbaric acts of the U.S. invading forces in Korea, "This is a report that Americans are unwilling to write. This is an ugly story in an ugly war, because many of the things I am about to describe are both sad and annoying to talk about."

One "ugly" aspect is that the U.S. imperialists are driving "children" to slaughter the Korean people. Osborne wrote: "Most of the soldiers sent to Korea to fight are still children, ranging in age from ten to about twenty. No wonder they are frightened when they go to the front lines. Many times they hear the sound of gunfire and abandon their weapons and flee backwards."

Another "ugly" aspect is the brutal atrocities of the U.S. invaders against the Korean people. Osborne said: "I am talking about this particularly terrible war. Because we want to achieve victory, we force our soldiers to adopt the most barbaric actions and styles on the battlefield. This barbarism is not the ordinary and inevitable barbarism on the battlefield, but even more cruel and barbaric behavior than that. Regardless of whether there are enemies there, villages are completely destroyed, and refugees are indiscriminately killed."

Osborne revealed the situation in which the U.S. invaders ordered the massacre of innocent refugees in South Korea, saying: "Once, at midnight, there were sparse gunshots all around the mountains. The phone rang from the outpost. An officer picked up the receiver, listened for a while, and turned around and said: 'Oh my god, what should we do! Three or four hundred refugees are coming towards B Company.' The commanding colonel replied: 'Order them to turn back!' The orderly asked: 'What if they don't turn back?' The colonel replied: 'Then, fire shots over their heads.' The orderly said: 'What if they still come over after firing shots in the air?' The colonel ordered: 'Then, if you like, just shoot straight at them.' So, the order was passed down the phone like that."

Osborne admitted that the South Korean puppet troops and police driven by the U.S. invaders were just as brutal. He said: "The South Korean troops fighting alongside us are equally barbaric and inhumane. I personally saw South Korean police officers killing prisoners alive for fear of danger while escorting them back to the rear. When they retreated from the front lines, they even strafed civilians crowding the roads in order to escape. The barbaric methods they use to extract information from civilians that we need are even more unspeakable."

　　美《时代杂志》暴露
    侵朝美军怯懦残暴           
    一上火线就害怕听见枪声就逃跑见村庄整个摧毁对难民一律杀害
    【新华社四日讯】八月二十一日出版的美国反动刊物《时代杂志》，刊载了该刊驻朝鲜记者奥斯本所写题为《丑恶的战争》的长篇报道。奥斯本劈头就承认：美国侵略军在朝鲜的毫无人性的野蛮行为，“这是一篇美国人所不愿意写的报告，这是丑恶战争中的丑恶故事，因为我所要叙述的许多事情，说来既伤心，又要惹人讨厌。”
    “丑恶”的一面是美帝国主义者驱使“孩子”们去屠杀朝鲜人民。奥斯本写道：“送到朝鲜来打仗的士兵，多半还是孩子，年龄由十岁到二十岁左右，无怪他们一上火线就要害怕起来，很多时候他们听了枪声，就弃械向后奔逃。”
    “丑恶”的另一面则是美国侵略者对朝鲜人民的残酷暴行。奥斯本说：“我说的是这一场特别恐怖的战争。因为我们要获取胜利，所以就强迫自己的兵士在战场上采取最野蛮的行动和作风。这种野蛮不是在战场上普通的不可避免的野蛮，而是比那还更残忍更野蛮的行为。不管那里有没有敌人，见了村庄就整个地彻底摧毁，对于难民无分别地杀害。”
    奥斯本透露了美国侵略者下令屠杀南朝鲜无辜难民的情形说：“有一次，在午夜的时候，在山岭的四周都有疏落的枪声。前哨摇来的电话响了，一个军官提起听筒听了一会，回头说道：‘哎呀，怎么办！三四百个难民正向Ｂ连走来。’指挥的上校答道：‘喝令他们回头！’传令官问道：‘如果他们不回头呢？’上校答道：‘那么，就向他们的头上放空枪。’传令官说：‘放了空枪他们仍过来时怎么办？’上校命令：‘那么，如果你们高兴，就对正放枪好了。’于是，命令就这样从电话里传下去了。”
    奥斯本承认，在美国侵略者驱策下的南朝鲜伪军警，也一样残暴。他说：“和我们并肩作战的南朝鲜军队，也是同样的野蛮到惨无人道。我亲眼看到南朝鲜警察在押送俘虏回后方时，因为害怕危险而活活地把俘虏杀死。在他们从前线溃退下来时，他们甚至扫射充塞路途的平民，以便夺路奔命。他们向平民探取我们所需要的情报时所用的野蛮手段，更是惨不忍述的。”
