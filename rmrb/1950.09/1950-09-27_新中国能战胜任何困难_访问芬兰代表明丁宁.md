　　New China Can Overcome Any Difficulty
    Interview with Finnish Representative Mintingning
    Finnish Democratic Youth representative Mintingning is 35 years old. He was originally a metal worker and joined the Finnish Communist Party in 1934, dedicating himself to the revolutionary struggle. In 1939, he was arrested and imprisoned by the fascist government. Thanks to the Party's education and cultivation, he learned Russian, English, and Swedish during his six years in prison. He was only liberated from prison after the Soviet Red Army defeated Nazi Germany. After that, he spent four years as a journalist, working as a radio commentator. He is now responsible for organizational work in the Finnish Democratic Youth League.
    This representative from the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," Finland, in his conversation with reporters, first expressed his special gratitude to the great Soviet Red Army for its assistance in the liberation of Finland. Not only was he able to be reborn from the prison of death because of it, but the entire Finnish people were also rescued from the bloody rule of the fascist elements thanks to the victory of the Soviet Red Army. Before this, the Finnish Communist Party could only operate underground, and now all democratic organizations in Finland can operate openly.
    The current Finnish government is mainly composed of the Agrarian League (a political party of the landlord class), with the Swedish People's Party also participating (Swedes account for 10 percent of the Finnish population and have obtained Finnish citizenship rights). Formally it is a "democratic" government, but in essence, it is a bourgeois dictatorship.
    This government, headed by the Agrarian League, protects the interests of capitalists even better than the Social Democratic Party-controlled government before the reorganization. It does not openly clamor against the Soviet Union like the Social Democrats, nor does it openly suppress the democratic activities of the working class. However, Party members and members of the Democratic Youth League among the workers are the first to be laid off when unemployment arrives. Progressive young people and teenagers are also threatened with dropping out of school and being expelled. All of this demonstrates the hypocrisy of the Finnish government, and the people's suffering can only be relieved by implementing a people's democratic system.
    Under the leadership of the Finnish Communist Party, the people of the whole country continue to carry out the people's democratic struggle. And launched a ruthless counterattack against the domestic reactionaries.
    Finland's progressive youth stand at the forefront of the struggle, becoming the largest torrent in the democratic movement.
    The Finnish Democratic Youth League is the strongest and most progressive organization in the youth movement. It was founded on December 31, 1944, and has now grown to 456 branches with more than 33,000 members. Its task is to unite and educate the broad masses of young people and fight for a peaceful and democratic Finland.
    Among the strongest and most progressive youth organizations is the Finnish Democratic Children's Team, founded on June 30, 1945, with 15,000 members and 250 branches.
    There are more than 50 youth organizations in Finland. In addition to the two largest and main progressive organizations mentioned above, there is also a larger reactionary organization, which is the "Finnish Social Democratic Youth League" shamelessly controlled by the Social Democratic Party. This organization is a tool for serving domestic and foreign reactionaries, and therefore, it is despised by the broad masses of Finnish youth.
    Thanks to the correct and strong leadership of the Finnish Communist Party and the Democratic Youth League, one-fifth of the country's population has responded to the Stockholm Peace Appeal and signed the Peace Book. Now it is continuing to work hard to complete the signature campaign of one million people.
    Mintingning finally talked about his impressions of coming to China this time, saying: "If the instigators of war take a trip like him, he will find that the great strength of the people of the new China after the victory is invincible. Although he cannot share the pleasant mood of this visit with me, he will get a good education."
    He continued, saying that he came to New China from a capitalist country, and all the beautiful impressions made him feel passionately happy.
    He discovered many great achievements from the workers, peasants, and school youth of New China, and therefore he believes that an even greater future will appear soon.
    He was also pleased to see that liberated Chinese women have achieved equal status with men in the new society. He heard people everywhere in Dalian talking about Tian Guiying, China's first female train driver. He said that such a miracle could only appear in China under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    This Finnish friend seemed unable to restrain his joyful emotions. He said that all the beautiful things in New China were brought by the Chinese Communist Party and are the achievements of the broad masses of Chinese people and youth engaged in the struggle. With such a party and such excellent youth, any difficulty can be overcome and any great task can be completed! (Attached picture)

### 新中国能战胜任何困难  访问芬兰代表明丁宁

专栏：世界青联代表访问记

　　新中国能战胜任何困难
    访问芬兰代表明丁宁
    芬兰民主青年代表明丁宁，今年三十五岁。原是金属工人，一九三四年参加芬兰共产党，献身于革命斗争。一九三九年被法西斯政府逮捕入狱，由于党的教育培养，在六年的牢狱生活里学会了俄、英、瑞典语文。直到苏联红军击溃了纳粹德国，他才从狱中得到解放。此后，他过了四年记者生活，担任无线电广播评论员。现在芬兰民主青年联合会负责组织工作。
    这位来自“千湖之国”芬兰的代表，在接见记者的谈话中，首先表示特别感谢伟大的苏联红军对芬兰解放所予的帮助。不只是他自己因而能够从死亡的牢狱中得到再生，并由于苏联红军的胜利才把全芬兰人民从法西斯分子血腥的统治下拯救了出来。在此以前，芬兰共产党只能作地下活动，现在芬兰一切的民主组织都可以公开活动了。
    现在的芬兰政府主要是由农民党（是地主阶级的政党）组成的，另有瑞典人民党（瑞典人在芬占芬人口百分之十，都取得了芬兰公民权利）参加。形式上是“民主”政府，实质上是资产阶级专政。
    这个以农民党为首的政府，比起改组以前的社会民主党人所掌握的政权，更好地保护着资本家利益。它不像社会民主党人公开叫嚣反苏，也不是公开的镇压工人阶级的民主活动，但是，工人中的党员、民主青年联合会会员在失业问题到来的时候，首先遭受解雇。进步的青年、少年在学校里也同样受到失学和被开除的威胁。这一切说明了芬兰政府的伪善面目，人民的苦难如要解除，必须实现人民民主制度。
    在芬兰共产党领导之下，全国人民继续进行着人民民主斗争。并且向国内反动派展开了无情的反击。
    芬兰的进步青少年挺立在斗争的前哨，成为民主运动中一支最大的洪流。
    芬兰民主青年联合会是青年运动中最强大最进步的组织。它成立于一九四四年十二月三十一日，现已发展至四百五十六个支部，拥有三万三千多个会员。它的任务是团结教育广大青年群众，为争取和平和民主的芬兰而斗争。
    在最强大最进步的少年组织中，是芬兰民主少年儿童队，它成立于一九四五年六月三十日，现有队员一万五千人，二百五十个支部。
    全芬兰青少年组织共有五十多个，除了上面提到的两个最大的主要的进步组织之外，还有一个反动的较大的组织，它就是在社会民主党无耻把持下的“芬兰社会民主青年联盟”。这个组织是替国内外反动派效忠的工具，因此，它为广大的芬兰青年群众所不齿。
    由于芬兰共产党和民主青年联合会正确坚强的领导，全国已有五分之一的人口响应斯德哥尔摩的和平宣言在和平书上签了名。现在正继续为完成百万人的签名运动而努力。
    明丁宁最后谈到他这次来到中国的印象，他说：“假如战争的挑拨者和他一样作一次旅行的话，他将会发现胜利后的新中国人民巨大力量是不可战胜的，他虽然不能和我共有这次访问的愉快心情，但他会得到很好的教育。”
    他继续说道，他是从资本主义国度来到新中国的，一切美好的印象使他感到激情的欢喜。
    他从新中国的工人、农民、学校青年身上，发现了许多伟大的成就，因而他相信不久将出现一个更伟大的将来。
    他还高兴看到被解放的中国妇女在新社会里和男子取得平等地位的事实。他在大连听到人们到处在说中国第一名女火车司机田桂英的事，他说，只有在共产党领导下的中国才会出现这样的奇迹。
    这位芬兰友人显得抑止不住他的喜悦的情绪，他说，新中国一切美好的事物，是中国共产党带来的，是广大的中国人民与青年从事于斗争的劳绩；有了这样的党和这样品质优秀的青年，就可以战胜任何困难，完成任何巨大的任务！（附图片）
