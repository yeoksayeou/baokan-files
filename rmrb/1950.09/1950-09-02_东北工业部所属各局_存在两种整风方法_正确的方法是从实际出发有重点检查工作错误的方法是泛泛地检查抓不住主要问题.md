(Shenyang News) Northeast Daily News: After studying the rectification documents in July, the various administrative bureaus under the Northeast Industrial Department began inspection work in August. However, due to the adoption of two different rectification methods, two different effects were produced.

One method is to determine the focus of rectification based on the actual situation of each bureau, and then, through joint meetings of the Party, government, and labor union, meetings of employee representatives, symposiums of technical personnel, cadre meetings, and general meetings of Party and Youth League branches, promote the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, inspect one issue at a time, find the root of the problem, and propose future solutions; and from the inspection work, connect the inspection of ideological style and leadership style. For example, the Textile Management Bureau discovered the following three problems from the inspection of product quality: First, when formulating the 1950 production plan, the technical conditions were not fully estimated, and the previous year's 110,000 spindles were increased to 200,000 spindles this year. The second is that the average use of funds for repairing machines meant that they tried to repair every machine, and as a result, no machines were repaired well. The third is that there was no strict inspection of the quality of raw cotton, and a good connection was not established with the Ministry of Trade, so the moisture content of the raw cotton was as high as 20% to 30%. All of the above points are important reasons for the poor quality of yarn. Other bureaus, such as the Coal Mine Management Bureau, the Electrical Engineering Bureau, the Electric Power Bureau, and the Light Industry Management Bureau, all use this method to inspect their work. Some have already proposed improvement methods, and some are still under discussion. This rectification method, which concentrates everyone's efforts on one issue, can not only thoroughly inspect the problem, but also put the rectification on the right track, so as not to abandon the problem and only talk about the leadership style of a certain person or a certain department.

The other method is to carry out inspections in a vague way, without finding the focus or grasping the urgent problems that need to be solved. The so-called letting go and promoting democracy emptily proposes to inspect the leadership. This not only fails to expose the problems, but also often turns into targeting a certain individual or degenerates into life details. For example, the Chemical Industry Bureau convened branch meetings, technical personnel symposiums, section chief joint meetings, and employee representative meetings. Because the leadership failed to grasp the key points, these meetings mainly focused on life issues, in addition to some opinions on the organizational structure. At the beginning, some factories in the Textile Bureau and the Light Industry Bureau also rectified the leadership style in isolation, or rectified relationship issues, which also resulted in deviations. Although the bureaus and factories that have taken detours have begun to reverse the situation, they have not yet been able to grasp the main problems.

On August 16, Wang Heshou, Minister of the Northeast Industrial Department, and Vice Ministers Lu Dong and An Zhiwen, specially convened a meeting of the directors and deputy directors of the ten management bureaus under their jurisdiction, such as the Chemical Industry Bureau, to listen to reports on the above rectification situation. On behalf of the Northeast Industrial Department, Vice Minister An Zhiwen gave three instructions on the future rectification: (1) According to the spirit of the Northeast Industrial Rectification Conference, combined with self-examination, conduct dissemination and discussion, and implement the spirit of the Industrial Conference into the rectification. (2) Each bureau should immediately correct the second rectification method and inspect work according to the first method. The focus of inspection should be on business management issues. (3) Each bureau should form a core group with the main cadres to grasp the direction of the rectification movement.

　　东北工业部所属各局
    存在两种整风方法
    正确的方法是从实际出发有重点检查工作错误的方法是泛泛地检查抓不住主要问题
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北工业部所属各管理局，继七月学习整风文件后，八月份即开始进行检查工作。但由于采取了两种不同的整风方法，以致产生了两种不同的效果。
    一种方法是：根据各该局实际情况，确定整风重点，然后通过党、政、工联席会、职工代表会、技术人员座谈会、干部会、党员、团员支部大会等各种会议，发扬批评与自我批评的精神，一个问题一个问题进行检查，找出问题症结，提出今后办法；并从检查工作中，联系检查思想作风与领导作风。如纺织管理局从检查产品质量中，发现以下三个问题：一个是制订一九五○年生产计划时，未充分估计到技术条件，即将去年十一万锭子提高到今年二十万锭子。另一个是在修理机器方面平均使用资金，什么机器都想修，结果什么机器都没修好。再一个是没有严格的检查原棉质量，未能与贸易部取得很好的联系，因之原棉水分竟高达百分之二十至三十。以上各点，都是影响纱的质量不良的重要原因。其他如煤矿管理局、电工局、电业局、轻工业管理局都用这方法检查工作。有的已经提出改进办法，有的正在讨论。这种由大家力量集中在一个问题上的整风办法，不但可以使问题检查的彻底，同时可以将整风引入正轨，不致抛开问题专谈某一个人或某一个处的领导作风问题。
    另一种方法是泛泛的进行检查，既未找到重点，亦未抓住迫切需要解决的问题，所谓放手发扬民主，空洞的提出检查领导。这样不仅问题不能被揭发出来，且往往变成以某一个人为对象，或流于生活细节。如化工局曾召开了支部会、技术人员座谈会、科长联席会、职工代表会，由于领导上未能掌握住重点，在这些会议上除对组织机构提出一些意见外，大部为生活问题。纺织局和轻工业某些厂在一开始也是孤立地整领导作风，或是整关系问题，结果也发生了偏差。走了弯路的局、厂虽已开始扭转，但至今尚未能抓住主要问题。
    八月十六日东北工业部王鹤寿部长、吕东、安志文副部长特召集所属化工等十个管理局局长、副局长会议，听取了以上整风情况的汇报。安志文副部长代表东北工业部，对今后整风指示三点：（一）根据东北工业整风会议精神，结合自我检讨，进行传达讨论，并将工业会议精神贯彻到整风中去。（二）各局应立即纠正第二种整风办法，按第一种办法检查工作。检查重点应以经营管理问题为主。（三）各局应以主要干部组成核心小组，掌握整风运动方向。
