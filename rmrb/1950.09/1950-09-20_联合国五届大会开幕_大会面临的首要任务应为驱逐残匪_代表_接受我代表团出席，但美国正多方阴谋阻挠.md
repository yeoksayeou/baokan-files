Xinhua News Agency, September 19th—The United Nations Fifth General Assembly opened on the 19th at Flushing Meadow in New York. The Soviet delegation, headed by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, the Belorussian delegation, headed by Kiselev, and the Ukrainian delegation, headed by Baranovsky, arrived in New York on the 19th to attend the Assembly. Over sixty items have already been announced on the agenda for this session, and member states may propose additional agenda items at any time during the session.

Since the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, representing a quarter of the world's population, have not yet been able to attend, the primary task facing the UN General Assembly at this session should be to expel the illegal "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique and accept the attendance of our delegation from the People's Republic of China. However, sources reveal that the United States government is attempting to continue violating UN principles and is engaging in various conspiracies to obstruct our delegation's attendance at this session. To this end, the illegal "Little General Assembly" under US manipulation specifically submitted the so-called "accusation against the Soviet Union" proposed by the Kuomintang bandit gang's illegal "representatives" at the previous UN General Assembly, which was full of shameless slander, to this session for discussion, attempting to slander the Chinese people and the Soviet Union and thereby fulfill its intention of preserving the Kuomintang political corpse within the United Nations. However, our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has already sent a telegram to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on the 16th, solemnly declaring that if the UN Fifth General Assembly proceeds without the participation of representatives from the People's Republic of China, or if it even allows the illegal "representatives" of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique to remain, then any resolutions it makes concerning Chinese issues will be illegal and therefore invalid.

　　联合国五届大会开幕
    大会面临的首要任务应为驱逐残匪“代表”  接受我代表团出席，但美国正多方阴谋阻挠
    【新华社十九日讯】联合国第五届大会已于十九日在纽约佛拉辛草地开幕。以苏联外长维辛斯基为首的苏联代表团，以基塞列夫为首的白俄罗斯代表团与以巴拉诺夫斯基为首的乌克兰代表团十九日抵纽约出席大会。现已陆续公布的本届大会议程已有六十余项，各会员国并可在会期内随时提出议程。
    由于占全世界人口四分之一的中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表尚未能出席，联合国本届大会面临之首要任务应为驱逐国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表”，并接受我中华人民共和国代表团出席大会。但各方面消息透露，美国政府正企图继续违反联合国原则，多方阴谋在本届大会中阻挠我代表团出席。美国操纵下的非法“小型联大”为此特于九月十五日将国民党匪帮的非法“代表”在上届联合国大会所提出的尽无耻诽谤之能事的所谓“控苏案”，交予本届大会讨论，企图以此污蔑中国人民和苏联，而遂行其在联合国内保存国民党政治僵尸的意图。但我周恩来外长已于十六日致电联合国秘书长赖伊，严正宣告，联合国五届大会如无中华人民共和国代表参加，或竟容留中国国民党反动残余集团非法“代表”在内，则其所作任何有关中国问题的决议，均将是非法的，因而也将是无效的。
