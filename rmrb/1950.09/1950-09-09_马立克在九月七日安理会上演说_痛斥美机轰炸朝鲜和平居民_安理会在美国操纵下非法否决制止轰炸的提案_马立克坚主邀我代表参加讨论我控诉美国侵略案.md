Xinhua News Agency, New York, 8th (TASS dispatch): The Security Council held two meetings on September 7th – one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with the same agenda as the previous meeting.

Security Council President Jebb invited Syngman Rhee's representative, Chang Myon, to attend. Soviet Representative Malik protested this ruling, deeming it unjust and illegal because the Soviet proposal was unrelated to the representatives of the Syngman Rhee clique.

Malik pointed out that the complaint against the US Air Force's barbaric bombing of peaceful Korean residents was brought before the Security Council by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, yet the representative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was illegally barred from the Security Council meeting. However, there was absolutely no reason to invite the representative of the Syngman Rhee clique to participate in this discussion because he not only does not care about stopping the barbaric bombing of peaceful Korean residents, but also encourages such barbaric bombing along with MacArthur and American militarists.

Jebb replied that he was "obliged" to invite Syngman Rhee's representative because this discussion was "undoubtedly" within the scope of the agenda item "Complaint of Aggression Against the Republic of Korea," and the Security Council had already decided to invite Syngman Rhee's representative to participate in the discussion of this agenda item.

Malik reiterated that the Soviet delegation considered this ruling illegal.

Malik then requested that the telegram from the Foreign Minister of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the Security Council protesting the barbaric bombing of peaceful Korean residents' homes, hospitals, and schools, etc., as well as the statement issued by the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland regarding the crimes of the Syngman Rhee clique, be included as part of the Security Council record.

Jebb said that both documents had been distributed to the members of the Security Council. He said that the documents were too long to be read at this meeting.

Malik reiterated that, given the importance of these documents, he requested that they be included in the record of today's meeting. However, he accepted Jebb's suggestion to append these documents to the detailed record of the meeting instead of reading them out at the meeting.

Then Malik began to deliver his statement in support of the Soviet proposal, which requested the Security Council to instruct the US government to stop bombing Korean towns and killing peaceful residents. Malik briefly described the content of the telegram from the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea protesting the inhuman and barbaric bombing of peaceful residents in areas with no military targets, as well as the telegram from the Democratic Front for the Unification of the Fatherland regarding the crimes of the Syngman Rhee clique. Malik said that the barbaric bombing and killing of peaceful towns and people in Korea could only be compared to the crimes of Hitler. Malik cited American journalists and official American military reports to prove that the US systematically destroyed non-military targets.

Malik said that the American command had burned entire villages to the ground.

Malik quoted a report from Associated Press reporter Bowyer as saying that Yeongdeok was destroyed like Nagasaki after the atomic bomb explosion after being bombed by the US Air Force and Navy. He said that the US Air Force not only bombed cities and towns, but also strafed pedestrians in the streets and farmers in rice paddies and vegetable gardens.

The American armed forces, under the orders of President Truman, invaded Korean territory, and the American high command violently implemented the "scorched earth" tactics on Korean territory. He cited as an example a report published in the New York Times on August 1st. The news said that the American security forces had begun to burn the houses behind the positions of the First Cavalry (Motorized – editor) Division, on the pretext that these houses could hide guerrillas.

Malik also cited evidence to prove that large numbers of people who refused to leave their homes were executed under the orders of the American militarists and their puppet – the Syngman Rhee clique. For example, one thousand people were executed in Daejeon, and three thousand people were executed in another city. This large-scale bloody terror brought life in large areas to a standstill.

Malik emphasized that the terrorist bombing had nothing to do with military operations, and its purpose was solely to destroy the people and industry of Korea. Malik then said that these bombings were carried out according to the same plan as the cannibalistic total war plan announced by Hitler.

Malik ridiculed MacArthur's excuse that the US destroyed these houses because they concealed military supplies, and said that MacArthur was using clumsy fabrications to justify US aggression in Korea. Malik said that Acheson, in his recent statement, attempted to justify the actions of deliberately destroying the Korean people with the same feeble excuses, but Acheson did not say a word about the barbaric bombing of peaceful cities and villages. This action grossly violated the Hague Convention. Since this convention is still valid, the United States must still be bound by it.

Malik reiterated the telegram from the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea requesting the Security Council to take urgent action to end the barbaric bombing, and protests against this barbaric behavior were also pouring in from all over the world to the Security Council; and concluded by saying that the Security Council must take action and pass the Soviet proposal on this issue.

After the translation of Malik's speech was completed, the Security Council announced a recess.

The afternoon meeting continued to discuss the Soviet proposal calling for a halt to the inhuman and barbaric bombing of peaceful Korean residents and cities.

US Representative Gross weakly attempted to answer Malik's speech exposing the US barbaric bombing, but could only provide indirect evidence for Malik's speech. Gross began his speech by citing Acheson's words at a press conference on September 6th, and insisted that US troops only bombed military targets. He then read excerpts from MacArthur's report to the United Nations, saying that US troops had used radio broadcasts and leaflets to urge Korean civilians to leave the vicinity of "military targets". Gross also read out several such leaflets. However, in doing so, Gross involuntarily provided evidence that US troops were bombing civilian areas. Gross coldly and shamelessly attempted to justify inhumane acts by quoting US Civil War General Sherman's saying, "War is hell!" The US representative asserted that the United Nations would help Korea revive after "peace is restored," in an attempt to reassure the victims of the US barbaric bombing. Gross attempted to divert attention from US crimes, insisting that the Korean army itself engaged in barbaric actions, asserting that the Koreans killed captured US soldiers and used schools and churches for military purposes. Indian Representative Rau, after mentioning the words in the preamble to the Soviet proposal about massacring the Korean people in large numbers by bombing, said: News about this bombing has been circulating for a long time. These messages caused an uproar in Indian public opinion. However, Rau declared that India would vote against the Soviet proposal. He attempted to justify his position by claiming that the Security Council could not act based on "assertions" without prior investigation.

Jebb, speaking as the British representative, like Gross, shamelessly attempted to "justify" the killing of innocent Korean civilians.

Jebb's speech began with a rude anti-Soviet rant. Malik pointed out that in previous speeches, he had quoted the Hague Convention which prohibits bombing undefended towns and villages by any means, especially by air and naval bombardment. He said: He had questioned whether the United States considered itself bound by the Hague Convention, but he had not heard any response from the US representative. This is a policy that completely disregards small countries. This is the policy of those who first destroy the towns and then propose to give "aid" in order to completely enslave the people. Obviously, the Korean people cannot accept this policy.

In conclusion, Malik spoke directly to "Mr. Aggressors and Provocateurs of War," advising them to stop interfering in Korea and give the Korean people the opportunity to organize their own lives without interference. Malik emphasized that the Korean people are fully capable of doing this. He said: The sooner the American imperialists stop interfering, the sooner the Korean question can be resolved peacefully.

Norwegian Representative Sunde stated that he would vote against the Soviet proposal. He insisted that the Soviet delegation had failed to provide evidence for its statement that the US Air Force violated international law. Therefore, despite Malik's presentation of a large amount of evidence proving that the US Air Force systematically and barbarically bombed peaceful Korean residents and destroyed Korean towns, the Security Council, under US manipulation, still failed to pass the Soviet proposal demanding that the United States stop these inhumane acts. The Soviet Union voted in favor of the proposal to stop the bombing, and the US, UK, France, Kuomintang, Ecuador, Cuba, Norway, India, and Egypt voted against it. Yugoslavia abstained.

After the vote, Malik declared that the Soviet delegation considered the action of the majority of the members of the Security Council in rejecting the Soviet proposal to be illegal and unjust. He continued: The Soviet delegation wishes to declare that those countries that voted against the Soviet proposal are responsible for the consequences of this unjust and illegal resolution. Then Jebb asked US Representative Gross to speak on the rules of procedure. He said: He would like to suggest that the Security Council consider the US proposal "Regarding the Bombing of Chinese Territory by Aircraft" before considering the Soviet complaint of "Armed Aggression against Taiwan (Formosa)". Gross urged the Security Council to treat the US proposal as a matter of "priority" discussion. Gross then began to read the original text of the US proposal.

Gross insisted that US aircraft had been given strict instructions not to fly across the Korean border, and Austin had stated that the United States was willing to compensate for any damage caused by the US Air Force to Chinese territory, and to punish the pilots responsible for the incident. He said: Based on these facts, it seems reasonable not to debate the issue until the Security Council receives a report from an on-site investigation. Finally, he urged the passage of the US proposal to send an investigation team composed of representatives from India and Sweden to investigate the alleged attacks on Chinese territory.

Malik said that Gross had not clarified whether he was discussing the substance of the issue or the procedure. Jebb said that it would be best to limit the discussion to the question of whether the agenda should be reversed. He said that if there were no objections, he would be willing to proceed with the discussion of the complaint of bombing Chinese territory at the request of the US representative. Malik pointed out that both issues were included in the agenda at the request of the Chinese People's Government, and said that, according to the practice of the Security Council, when dealing with international conflicts or disputes, it has always been decided to invite the complainant to attend the meeting without prejudice to future decisions or discussions on how to deal with the complaint. Jebb interrupted Malik and insisted that Malik had touched on substantive issues when he raised the issue of inviting representatives of the Chinese People's Government. Malik replied that his words were entirely about procedural issues, and insisted that before a decision was made on procedural issues, a decision should first be made on the issue of inviting representatives of the Chinese People's Government. He emphasized that if the Security Council made a decision without the presence of representatives of the Chinese People, then it would be difficult for it to decide which issue was more important from the standpoint of the Chinese People and needed to be discussed first.

Jebb then declared that the issue of the presence of representatives of the Beijing government at the Security Council was irrelevant to the current issue, which was whether to change the agenda and first consider the US proposal. He suggested that the Security Council hold a vote on this point.

In his reply, Malik declared that the Security Council must follow regular procedures and not follow the will of the United States, which wants the Security Council to do whatever it wants. He declared that it was absurd for the Security Council to arbitrarily decide to discuss which proposal first without inviting Chinese representatives. The Security Council has no right to exclude representatives of a government that has lodged a complaint with the Security Council. The Security Council must invite Chinese representatives who are related to both issues facing the Security Council.

Malik traced back to August 29th when the Soviet Union had suggested inviting Chinese representatives, but the US representative and the representatives of various countries that followed the US blocked the passage of the Soviet proposal.

Malik pointed out that Gross had made it clear that he did not want Chinese representatives to participate in the discussion of the US proposal regarding the bombing of Chinese territory. He also said that this was the crux of the US attitude - an attempt to prevent Chinese representatives from participating in discussions about China. Malik said that at least the US representative had made the Security Council aware of his true intentions, which was to exclude the representatives of the Chinese people when discussing the issue of bombing Chinese territory. But the Security Council must follow the rules of procedure and the Charter, and not the will of the US government.

Those representatives who only want to follow the will of the United States can do so, but the Soviet representative insists that this is not the way to solve the problem, and only inviting the representatives of the Chinese People's Government first is in line with the Charter.

Malik then said: The Soviet proposal regarding Taiwan was proposed before the US proposal, so it should be discussed first. Jebb ruled, after Kuomintang member Jiang Tingfu spoke, that no decision should be made on the issue of inviting Chinese representatives until the Security Council had decided whether to discuss the US proposal or the Soviet proposal first.

Malik accused Jebb's ruling of being illegal and violating the Security Council's rules of procedure.

Jebb asked for a vote on his ruling. The Soviet Union and Yugoslavia voted against Jebb's ruling. Thus, Jebb's ruling was established due to the mechanical vote of the US group, and Jebb then asked the Security Council to vote on the US proposal, namely: The Security Council should discuss the US proposal regarding the bombing of Chinese territory before discussing the Soviet proposal regarding Taiwan.

The US group again used the mechanical vote of the majority. The United States, the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Ecuador, Cuba, Yugoslavia, and the Kuomintang voted in favor of discussing the US proposal first. The Soviet Union voted against it. India and Egypt abstained.

Malik urged the Security Council to vote on the Soviet proposal of September 5th before proceeding with the discussion of this topic, namely: "The Security Council, for the purpose of discussing the complaint of aircraft bombing Chinese territory, decides to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the Security Council meeting."

Gross declared: If the Security Council is willing, he will not oppose this procedure. After some discussion on this matter, Jebb asked for a vote on whether the Security Council should first consider the Soviet proposal to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, France, Norway, India, Egypt, and Yugoslavia voted in favor, Cuba, Ecuador, and the Kuomintang voted against, and the United States abstained.

Jebb proposed a recess. The Security Council decided to hold a closed meeting on September 8 (Friday) to discuss the Security Council's annual work report to the United Nations General Assembly, and to adjourn the meeting after convening on September 11 (Monday).

　　马立克在九月七日安理会上演说
    痛斥美机轰炸朝鲜和平居民
    安理会在美国操纵下非法否决制止轰炸的提案
    马立克坚主邀我代表参加讨论我控诉美国侵略案
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约八日电：九月七日，安全理事会举行了两次会议——一次在早晨，一次在下午，议程与上次会议相同。
    安理会主席杰伯邀请李承晚代表张勉出席。苏联代表马立克抗议这种裁决，认为这是不公正的与非法的，因为苏联所提出的提案是与李承晚集团的代表无关的。
    马立克指出：对美国空军野蛮轰炸朝鲜和平居民的控诉，是由于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国所提的控诉而在安理会上提出的，可是朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表却由于非法的决议竟被拒于安理会会议之外。但是绝没有任何理由邀请李承晚集团的代表参加这个讨论，因为他不但绝不关心制止对朝鲜和平居民的野蛮轰炸，而且还与麦克阿瑟及美国军国主义者一道鼓励这种野蛮的轰炸。
    杰伯答称：他“理应”邀请李承晚的代表，因为这个讨论“无疑”是在“控诉大韩民国的侵略案”这一项议程范围之内，而安理会业已决定邀请李承晚的代表参加这项议程的讨论。
    马立克重申苏联代表团认为这一裁决是非法的。
    马立克随后要求把朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府外交部长致安理会抗议野蛮轰炸朝鲜和平居民的住宅、医院及学校等等的来电以及朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线所发表的关于李承晚集团罪行的声明列为安理会纪录的一部分。
    杰伯说：这两个文件已经分发给安理会的各理事。他说：文件太长，不便在这次会议上宣读。
    马立克重申鉴于这些文件的重要性，他要求将它们列入今日会议的纪录中。但是他接受杰伯的建议，将这些文件附入会议的详细纪录中，不在会上宣读。
    于是马立克开始发表他支持苏联提案的声明，这个提案要求安理会责成美国政府停止轰炸朝鲜城镇与杀害和平居民。马立克扼要地叙述了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交部长抗议对毫无军事目标的地方的和平居民进行惨无人道的野蛮轰炸的电报内容，以及祖国统一民主主义战线关于李承晚集团的罪行的来电内容。马立克说：对朝鲜和平城镇和人民的野蛮轰炸和杀害，只有希特勒的罪行才能和它比拟。马立克援引美国记者和美国官方的军事报告，证明美国有系统地毁灭非军事目标。
    马立克说：美国统帅部把整个整个的村庄烧成一片焦土。
    马立克引据美联社记者包义尔的消息说：盈德在美国空军和海军的轰击后，被摧毁得像长崎在原子弹爆炸后一样。他说：美国空军不仅轰炸城市和村镇，而且还扫射街上的行人和稻田与菜园里的农民。
    美国武装部队奉杜鲁门总统的命令进犯朝鲜领土，美国高级统帅部在朝鲜领土上狂暴地实施“焦土”战术。他引证纽约时报八月一日刊载的消息为例。这个消息说，美国治安部队已开始焚烧第一骑兵（摩托化——编者）师阵地后面的房屋，借口是这些房屋可以隐藏游击队。
    马立克并援引证据，证明大批拒绝离开他们家园的人，在美国军国主义者及其傀儡——李承晚集团的命令下被处死。例如，在大田就有一千人被处死，在另一城市有三千人被处死。这种大规模的血腥恐怖，使得大片地区的生活陷于停顿。
    马立克强调指出，恐怖主义的轰炸与军事行动并无关系，其目的专在毁灭朝鲜的人民与工业。马立克接着说，这些轰炸是按照与希特勒所宣布的吃人生番的总体战计划一样的计划执行的。
    马立克对麦克阿瑟所说美国所以毁坏这些房屋是因为它们掩藏军事供应品这种饰词，加以嘲笑，并说，麦克阿瑟是用笨拙的捏造来辩解美国在朝鲜的侵略。马立克说，艾奇逊在最近的声明中企图用同样无力的借口来辩解蓄意毁灭朝鲜人民的行动，但是艾奇逊对于野蛮地轰炸和平城市与乡村的行动，却一字不提。这种行动粗暴地破坏了海牙公约。既然这一公约仍然有效，美国就必须仍然受它的约束。
    马立克再度提到朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外交部长来电请求安理会采取紧急行动结束野蛮的轰炸，世界各地也纷纷向安理会抗议这种野蛮行为；并作结语说，安理会必须采取行动，通过苏联就这一问题提出的提案。
    在马立克的演说译完之后，安理会即宣布休会。
    下午会议继续讨论苏联所提要求停止惨无人道地野蛮轰炸朝鲜和平居民与城市的提案。
    美国代表葛罗斯软弱无力地企图回答马立克揭露美国野蛮轰炸的发言，但是却只能给马立克的发言提供了间接的证据。葛罗斯在发言时一开始便援引艾奇逊九月六日在记者招待会上所说的话，而且硬说美国部队只轰炸军事目标。随后他还宣读麦克阿瑟给联合国的报告摘录，说什么美国部队曾以无线电广播及传单促请朝鲜平民离开“军事目标”附近地区。葛罗斯还宣读了几张这样的传单。可是这样，葛罗斯却不由自主地提供了证据，说明美国部队轰炸平民住区。葛罗斯冷酷而无耻地企图引用美国内战时的将军薛尔曼所说的“战争就是地狱！”这句话，来为惨无人道的行径辩解。美国代表断言联合国将在“和平恢复”后帮助朝鲜复兴，力图以此使美国野蛮轰炸下的牺牲者“安心”。葛罗斯企图转移人们对美国罪行的注意，硬说朝鲜军队本身从事野蛮行动，断言朝鲜人杀害被俘虏的美军，将学校与教堂用于军事目的。印度代表劳氏在提到苏联提案序言中关于以轰炸来大批屠杀朝鲜人民的话之后，说道：关于这种轰炸的消息，许久以来便已盛传。这些消息使印度的舆论哗然。然而劳氏却宣称：印度将投票反对苏联的提案。他力图为他这种立场辩解，借口说什么安理会不能不作事先调查而依照“断言”行事。
    杰伯以英国代表的身份发言，像葛罗斯一样，他无耻地企图为杀戮朝鲜无辜平民的行为“辩解”。
    杰伯的发言一开始便作粗暴的反苏咆哮。马立克指出，在以前的发言中，他曾引用过禁止以任何手段，尤其是以空、海军轰击不设防城镇与村庄的海牙公约。他说：他曾质问过美国是否认为其本身受海牙公约的约束，可是他却没有听到美国代表作任何回答。这是完全不顾小国的政策。这是那些先毁灭各城镇、在毁灭之后又提议给予“援助”以求彻底奴役人民的人们的政策。很明显地，朝鲜人民是不能接受这个政策的。
    马立克在结语中直接向“侵略者及战争挑拨者先生们”发言，忠告他们停止干涉朝鲜，给朝鲜人民以不受干涉组织他们自己的生活的机会。马立克着重指出：朝鲜人民是完全能够作到这一点的。他说：美帝国主义者越早停止干涉，朝鲜问题便能够越早求得和平解决。
    挪威代表森德声明他将投票反对苏联提案。他硬说苏联代表团未能就其美国空军破坏国际法的声明提出证据。因此，尽管马立克提出大量证据，证明美国空军有系统地野蛮轰炸朝鲜和平居民，毁灭朝鲜城镇，然而安理会在美国操纵下却仍然未能通过苏联要求美国停止这些惨无人道行为的提案。苏联投票拥护要求停止轰炸的提案，投反对票的有美、英、法、国民党、厄瓜多尔、古巴、挪威、印度、埃及。南斯拉夫弃权。
    在表决后，马立克宣称：苏联代表团认为安理会多数会员国否决苏联提案的行动，是非法的和不公正的。他继称：苏联代表团愿声明：那些投票反对苏联提案的国家，要对这一不公正的非法决议的后果负责。接着杰伯请美国代表葛罗斯就议事规则发言。他说：他愿意建议安理会在考虑苏联控诉“武装侵略台湾（福摩萨）”的提案以前，考虑美国“关于飞机轰炸中国领土”的提案。葛罗斯敦促安理会将美国提案作为“优先”讨论事宜。接着葛罗斯便开始宣读美国提案的原文。
    葛罗斯硬说：美国飞机曾奉有严格的训令，不许飞越朝鲜边境，并且奥斯汀已经表示美国愿意赔偿美国空军所加之予中国领土的任何损失，并惩戒应负肇事责任的飞行员。他说：根据这些事责，在安理会获得实地调查报告以前，不就该问题进行辩论似乎是合理的。最后他敦促通过美国所提关于派遣由印度与瑞典代表组成的调查团去调查所传对中国领土的袭击的提案。
    马立克说，葛罗斯没有弄清楚究竟是讨论问题的实质，还是讨论程序。杰伯说，现在最好把讨论仅限于议程应否颠倒的问题。他说，假若没有异议的话，他愿依照美国代表的请求进行讨论轰炸中国领土的控诉。马立克指出，这两个问题都是依照中国人民政府的请求而列入议程的，并称，按照安理会的惯例，向来在进行处理国际冲突或争论的时候，总是决定邀请控诉者出席会议而不妨害将来的决定或讨论该控诉的方式。杰伯打断了马立克的话，并且硬说马立克在提出邀请中国人民政府代表问题时便扯到实质问题上去了。马立克答称，他的话完全是讨论程序问题，并且坚主，在就程序问题作出决定之前，应该先决定邀请中国人民政府代表的问题。他强调称，假如安理会在没有中国人民代表出席的情况下作决定的话，那末它就很难决定从中国人民的立场看来究竟是那一个问题更重要而需要首先讨论。
    杰伯接着宣称，北京政府代表出席安理会的问题，与安理会当前的问题无关，当前的问题就是是否改变议程和首先考虑美国的提案。他建议安理会就这一点举行表决。
    马立克在其答语中宣称，安理会必须遵循正规的程序，而不应遵循美国的意旨，它要安理会怎么做就怎么做。他宣称，安理会不邀请中国代表便擅自决定首先讨论那个提案的问题是很荒谬的。安理会没有权利排斥向安理会提出控诉的政府的代表。安理会必须邀请与安理会所面临的两个问题都有关的中国代表。
    马立克追溯道，早在八月二十九日苏联就曾建议邀请中国代表，但是美国代表和美国亦步亦趋的各国代表阻挠通过苏联的建议。
    马立克指出，葛罗斯已经说清楚，他不希望有中国代表参加讨论美国关于轰炸中国领土的提案。他并称，这就是美国的态度之症结所在——企图阻挠中国代表参加讨论有关中国的问题。马立克说，至少美国代表已使安理会洞悉了他的真实意图，即要在讨论轰炸中国领土问题时排斥中国人民的代表。但是安理会必须遵循议事规则和宪章，而不能遵循美国政府的意旨。
    那些只想跟着美国意旨跑的代表们可以这样做，但是苏联代表坚持主张这不是解决的办法，只有首先邀请中国人民政府的代表才符合宪章。
    马立克然后又说道：苏联关于台湾的提案，是在美国提案之前提出的，所以应该首先讨论。杰伯在国民党人蒋廷黻发言之后裁决称：在安理会尚未决定首先讨论美国提案还是苏联提案之前，不应在邀请中国代表的问题上作决定。
    马立克指斥杰伯的裁决不合法，并违犯安理会的议事规则。
    杰伯要求表决他的裁决。苏联和南斯拉夫投票反对杰伯的裁决。于是，杰伯的裁决便因美国集团的机械表决而得以成立，杰伯然后要求安理会表决美国的提议，即：安理会在讨论苏联关于台湾的提案之前首先讨论美国关于轰炸中国领土的提案。
    美国集团再度运用占多数的机械的表决。美国、联合王国、法国、挪威、厄瓜多尔、古巴、南斯拉夫和国民党投票赞成首先讨论美国的提案。苏联投票反对。印度及埃及弃权。
    马立克促请安理会在进行本题的讨论之前，应表决苏联于九月五日提出的提案，即：“安理会为讨论控诉飞机轰炸中国领土问题，决定邀请中华人民共和国的代表出席安全理事会会议”。
    葛罗斯宣称：如果安理会愿意，他将不反对这个程序。在这件事经过一番讨论之后，杰伯要求表决安理会是否应该先考虑苏联所提邀请中华人民共和国代表这一建议的问题。苏联、联合王国、法国、挪威、印度、埃及、南斯拉夫投票赞成，古巴、厄瓜多尔及国民党反对，美国弃权。
    杰伯提议休会。安理会在决定于九月八日（星期五）举行秘密会议，讨论提交联合国大会的安理会一年工作报告，并于九月十一日（星期一）开会后即行休会。
