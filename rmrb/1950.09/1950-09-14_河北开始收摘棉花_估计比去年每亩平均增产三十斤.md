　　河北开始收摘棉花
    估计比去年每亩平均增产三十斤
    【新华社保定十二日电】河北省一千二百万亩棉田已开始摘花，新棉且已上市。今年全省大部地区因棉农勤劳耕作，雨水调匀，播种适时，并由于战胜了各种虫害，棉花生长良好。估计全省每亩棉田平均可产籽棉八十斤左右，比去年每亩平均增产三十斤。省内良棉指导区的近八十万亩棉田，每亩平均可产棉一百斤以上，个别地区且有产三、四百斤者。全省今年共可收摘皮棉三亿斤以上，同时新花的品质也比去年为好。
    现各地新花已源源上市。保定、定县市场上市新花已占市场棉花总量百分之九十。临清上市的籽棉日达二十万斤左右。为保障棉农利益和适应工业需要，河北省花纱布分公司及其所属各级机构现正在正确掌握棉价政策的原则下，开始收购新花。
