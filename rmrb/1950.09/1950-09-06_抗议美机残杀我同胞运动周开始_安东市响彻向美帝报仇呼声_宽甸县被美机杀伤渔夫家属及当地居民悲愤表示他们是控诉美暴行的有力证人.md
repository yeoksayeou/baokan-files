Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 5th -- The Week of Protesting American Planes Killing Our Compatriots by people from all walks of life in Andong City has begun on the 4th. On that day, striking red slogans were hung across the main thoroughfares of the city, reading: "Protest American Planes Killing the People of Andong City!" In front of the colorful cartoons, wall newspapers, and blackboard newspapers posted everywhere on both sides of the streets, crowds of people were gathered. More than 1,700 employees of the state-owned Andong Paper Mill held a protest rally after work and invited Lü Qi'en, Secretary of the Andong Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, to speak. All the workers present unanimously expressed their determination to actively produce and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan to avenge the murdered compatriots. All cadres of the 14 units under the Andong Municipal People's Government have begun to study and discuss Foreign Minister Zhou's protest statement against the American planes' intrusion and strafing incident. The Andong City Federation of Industry and Commerce convened two discussion meetings on this day, gathering over a hundred representatives from major industries in the city. The representatives unanimously condemned the atrocities of the American planes and unanimously signed the protest letter. The Movement Committee to Protest American Planes Killing Our Compatriots has transferred 220 cadres to form propaganda teams, which will soon go to various neighborhoods to carry out extensive propaganda.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th -- The brutal crime of American planes strafing and killing fishermen on the Yalu River on the 29th of last month has aroused great anger among the families of the victims and local peaceful residents. The reporter of this agency rushed to Gulouzi Village in Kuandian County, located 40 kilometers northeast along the river from Andong City, and the river surface and civilian ships where our workers were killed to make an on-the-spot observation the day after the incident occurred. Among the eleven fishermen killed and injured by American planes this time, six were residents of this village. The people of this peaceful rural village suffered such a sudden misfortune, and the villagers are extremely saddened and angry.

In the home of fisherman Wu Xichun, who was killed by an American plane, there are his nearly 80-year-old mother and an infant less than three months old; including his wife, older children, and younger sister, there are eight people in total. Wu Chunxi's elderly mother, white-haired and blind, cried to the reporter, "The Americans used planes to kill my son. I will never forget this hatred and must deal with them! Must deal with them!" The old lady and her grandchildren personally led the reporter to Wu Xichun's grave to mourn. In the home of another victim, Dong Jingui (previously mistakenly reported as Huang Jingui), we saw his wife and three children. Dong Jingui's body was being prepared for burial, and his wife was so saddened by his death that she could not sleep for two nights. When the reporter asked to take a photo of her husband's body, she cried and said, "Take a photo! Let all of China see that my husband was killed by American planes. We must all avenge him!" When the reporter visited Zhang Yunzhi's wife, who was injured by an American plane and is now being treated at Andong Municipal Hospital, she took out her husband's blood-stained clothes that were torn by the American planes' strafing. The left front and back of the clothes and the lower part of the right sleeve were completely torn and covered with bright red blood stains. She said with grief and indignation, "This is a blood debt owed to us by the American devils, and they must pay this blood debt in full."

Yang Decheng and the other five people who are receiving treatment at Andong Municipal Hospital also expressed their firm determination to the reporter. They said: Some of their arms have been disabled, some of their fingers have been broken, and some of their thighs have been pierced. This is ironclad proof of the crimes of the American devils, and we can never forget it. They expressed that after they recover from their injuries, they will contribute even more of their strength to serve the motherland and the people. "We will not be satisfied until the American imperialist murderers are punished, our losses are compensated, and the American troops invading Taiwan and Korea are withdrawn."

Other injured family members are also filled with unparalleled grief and indignation. They all said: They wish they could have seen those "murderous planes" shot down and caught those murderers on the spot and bitten them to death. When they heard the reporter talk about how our Foreign Minister Zhou had lodged protests and accusations with the United States and the United Nations, they sincerely thanked our People's Government for avenging their loved ones and expressed that they themselves are powerful witnesses to accuse the American air force of killing people.

　　抗议美机残杀我同胞运动周开始
    安东市响彻向美帝报仇呼声
    宽甸县被美机杀伤渔夫家属及当地居民悲愤表示他们是控诉美暴行的有力证人
    【新华社安东五日电】安东市各界人民抗议美机残杀我国同胞运动周已自四日起开始。是日全市通衢大道的上空横悬着鲜红触目的标语，上面写着：“抗议美机残杀安东市人民！”在街道两旁到处贴着的五彩漫画、墙报及黑板报前面，拥挤着围观的群众。国营安东造纸厂职工一千七百余人于下工后举行抗议大会，并邀请中共安东市委书记吕其恩出席讲话。与会的全体工人一致表示要以积极生产，支援人民解放军解放台湾来为被害同胞复仇。安东市人民政府所属十四个单位全体干部已开始学习并讨论周外长对美机的入侵和扫射事件的抗议声明。安东市工商联合会在是日曾两度召集本市主要行业代表共百余人举行座谈会，各行业代表在会上一致痛斥美机暴行，并一致在抗议书上签名。抗议美机残杀我国同胞运动委员会已抽调干部二百二十人组成宣传队，即将分赴各里闾展开广泛宣传。
    【新华社沈阳五日电】美机在上月二十九日扫射杀伤我国鸭绿江上渔夫的残暴罪行，引起了被难者家属和当地和平居民的极大愤怒。本社记者于事件发生之次日，即赶往位于安东市东北沿江上行四十余公里处的宽甸县古楼子村及我国工人遇难的江面和民船上作实地观察。此次被美机扫射死伤的十一名渔夫中，就有六名为该村居民。这一和平农村的人民遭受了如此突然的不幸事件，村民们是万分悲痛和愤怒的。
    被美机打死的渔夫吴锡纯家中，留下了年近八十岁的老母和未及三个月的幼儿；连同他的妻子、较大的儿女和妹妹在内共八个人。白发斑斑双目失明的吴纯锡老母，向记者哭诉着说：“美国用飞机把我儿子打死，我永远不会忘记这个仇恨，一定要办他！要办他呀！”老太太和她的孙儿们亲自领着记者到吴锡纯的坟上去悼念。在另一个死难者董金贵（前误为黄金贵）的家里，我们看到了他的妻子和三个小孩。董金贵的尸体正在装殓，他的妻子为他的死，悲痛得两夜不能成眠。当记者要求为她丈夫的尸体拍摄照片时，她哭着说：“照下来吧！让咱们全中国人都看看我的丈夫是被美国飞机打死的，我们大家一定要替他报仇！”记者访问被美机击伤现在安东市立医院治疗的张云芝的妻子时，她拿出她丈夫身穿的被美机扫射打破的血衣，衣上左前后襟及右袖下部已完全破了，染满了鲜红的血迹。她悲愤地说：“这是美国鬼子欠下我们的血账，这笔血账一定要他们还清。”
    正在安东市立医院养伤的杨德诚等五人，也向记者表示了他们的坚决意志。他们表示：他们有的手臂被打成残废了，有的手指被打断了，有的大腿被打穿了，这是美国鬼子罪行的铁证，我们永远也不能忘记。他们表示要在伤好以后，更加倍地贡献出他们的力量来为祖国和人民服务。“美帝国主义的凶手一天不惩办，我们的损失一天不赔偿，侵略台湾、朝鲜的美国军队一天不撤退，我们是一天也不能甘心的。”
    其他受伤的家属也都怀着无比的悲愤，他们都表示：恨不得当时就亲眼看见把这些“杀人的飞机”打下来，抓住那些凶手，用牙咬死他们。当他们听到记者谈及我国周外长已向美国和联合国提出抗议和控诉时，都衷心地感激我人民政府为他们的亲人报仇伸冤，并表示他们自己就是控诉美国空军杀人暴行的有力证人。
