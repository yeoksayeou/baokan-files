　　Workers Across the Country Welcome National Day with Production Improvement Competitions
    [This newspaper reports] Workers in Northeast China, Tianjin, Qingdao and other places are enthusiastically launching production improvement competitions to welcome National Day.
  Northeast China
    The production competition launched by state-owned and public factories in Shenyang to celebrate National Day, combined with the awarding and promotion of heroes and model workers, has involved the vast majority of workers in the city in a tense production upsurge. The rubber factories of the city's Light Industry Trade Union are competing to improve quality and ensure the completion of tasks. For example, the Rubber No. 7 Factory started the competition in August. On the basis of popularizing the experience of the Ma Hengchang team, the molding workshop No. 2 has emerged as a model workshop, and the finance section calculated the cost for August in four days in early September, creating a new record of calculating the cost in less than five days, which was the fastest in the past. The workers of the factory are conducting the production competition in September. The Rubber No. 2 Factory proposed the competition conditions of ensuring good production quality and reducing defective products and second-class products. The Rubber No. 4 Factory created a new record of reducing defective products in shoe edge pressing. In addition, workers from Rubber No. 1 Factory and No. 6 Factory also participated in the competition. The competition organized by the Tram, Automobile, Waterworks and Gas factories of the Municipal Engineering Trade Union of the city started on September 15. The competition content is to establish a normal responsibility system and promote the experience of the Ma Hengchang team, and do a good job in team work. The Shenyang Chemical Factory and other units in the chemical system focused on implementing workshop economic accounting and responsibility system as the central content of the competition and made plans. The hardening oil plant and the paint plant launched challenge competitions under the specific conditions of reducing costs and ensuring product specifications. Each shift of the power section and the second substation signed competition contracts with the directly related departments to ensure the timely supply of steam and electricity and no accidents; the workers and technicians of the liquid gas department of the electrolysis plant launched a production upsurge to welcome National Day. By September 5, they had completed the annual production task ahead of schedule, and the quality purity increased from 94.3% in the past to 99.8%. Workers in other units such as the Clothing Trade Union and the Electrical Engineering Trade Union also participated in the competition movement.
    The production competition in Shenyang factories has gradually developed from direct production workers to indirect production technicians and staff, which is a progressive phenomenon. The city's Federation of Trade Unions has also called for turning the competition into a regular working method.
    In order to celebrate National Day, the workers of the Harbin Industrial Company Glass Factory decided to complete the total task of 1,960 vats of materials in September ahead of schedule, and also make up for the 6 vats of materials that were not completed in August. The workers have put forward challenges and guarantees. For example, the Diao Naile team proposed to improve the method of losing 40 out of 100 large distilled water bottles (each worth 170,000 yuan) in the past, so that the loss is reduced from 40 to less than 15, and the bottle mouth is not crooked, so that the loss can be reduced by 3-4 million Northeast yuan per day. In the past, a large amount of money was spent on repairing the large furnace in the factory's production. The refractory materials for repairing the furnace had to be bought new from Shenyang, but this time Zhao Zhenlong and others, the advanced producers of the firing team, proposed to repair it with the materials dismantled from the old furnace in the past, and guaranteed that it would be as effective as the previous furnace. It is estimated that 50 million Northeast yuan can be saved on refractory bricks, small steel bricks and other materials.
    The state-owned Northeast Kaishantun Paper Mill overfulfilled the state-ordered task of 440 tons of pulp in August when power outages occurred frequently, and is now striving to complete the third quarter production task as a gift to National Day. In addition, workers of the Jilin State-owned Shixian Paper Mill also enthusiastically launched a competition.
    Workers of Shuangtashan Power Plant launched a competition to save raw materials and increase production. The operation team of the plant guaranteed not to delay the delivery of electricity for one minute and strived to eliminate accidents; the boiler team proposed to save 10,000 kilograms of coal in September by reducing the size of the fan, and guaranteed that the power generation would not be reduced. The maintenance team guaranteed to partially use the coal puller newly created by the workers of the plant on October 1. The workers also made production plans individually.
    In addition, the Beipiao Mining Bureau proposed to reduce the ash content of coal to 20% in September (it was 27.8% to 37.8% in the past), and strengthen security, no longer engage in boarding behavior, and eliminate liability accidents. The Yingkou State-owned Northeast Fifth Textile Factory, in addition to ensuring the completion of production tasks, is also preparing to hold a sports meeting for all employees to strengthen unity and improve production.
  Tianjin
    The No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4 power plants of the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau achieved results in completing the quota work in the third quarter. In August, the coal consumption item saved more than 186 tons of coal in the three factories. In order to consolidate the achievements since the third quarter and celebrate National Day, all employees of the three power plants, under the call of the Electric Power Trade Union, decided to launch a competition movement to overfulfill tasks, create new records, and ensure no accidents. The Public Utilities Bureau of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government and the Trade Union of organs launched an organ work competition movement from the beginning of September to overcome bureaucracy and improve work efficiency.
  Qingdao
    Workers in various industrial units in Qingdao enthusiastically welcome the Labor Model Representative Conference and the first National Day anniversary, and launch production competitions. As of September 8, regular competitions in the China Textile No. 6 Factory, Machinery Factory, etc. have begun. Highway transportation workers are working on quotas to establish a responsibility system and are preparing to launch a comprehensive model motorcade movement. In addition, workers in the hardware, tobacco and postal services, and telecommunications bureaus have also launched competition movements.
  Datong
    The production competition launched by state-owned and public factories and mines in Datong City to welcome National Day has achieved preliminary results in improving production efficiency and reducing costs. The Wu Fa mining team (a Ma Hengchang-style team) of the No. 3 well of Yongdingzhuang Mine under Datong Mine exceeded the production quota by 17.75%. The machine repair factory successfully imitated the ammeter. The Xue Tang tunneling team of Tongjialiang Mine reached a progress of 1.13 meters (the quota is 75 centimeters). After education for some backward workers in Meiyukou, the workers united and actively produced. The rivet team of Meiyukou tried its best to use waste materials to repair 44 coal cars, saving 176 pieces of tile, one 3-point wide and 4-inch thick angle iron, 20 kilograms of rivets, 232 3-inch screws, two iron plates, and many other parts. Workers in Datong City Telecommunications Bureau and Printing Bureau also launched production competitions.
    In addition, the workers of Changzhi Wujian Factory made plans, accepted the experience in the production movement in the first half of the year, and launched a new production movement. Zhang Yiyuan, a worker at the Liulihe Cement Factory, designed a kiln head air door to reduce coal consumption in production as a gift for National Day.
