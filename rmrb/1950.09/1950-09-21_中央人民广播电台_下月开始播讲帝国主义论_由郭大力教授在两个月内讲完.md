The lecture series on the History of Social Development is still being rebroadcast. Currently, listeners are located in twenty-three provinces, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Beijing, Tianjin, and major municipalities directly under the central government. Nearly five hundred organizations, groups, and schools across the country are organizing listening sessions and directly contacting the station. According to statistics from 297 of these units, the total number of listeners is approximately 86,000. Everyone believes that listening to the broadcasts is of great help to their studies.

Furthermore, after the station announced changes to the broadcast schedule on October 1st, it received letters from listeners in various locations requesting that the social science lecture series time not be changed. The station has now decided, based on listeners' requests, that the first, second, and third broadcast times will remain unchanged from October 1st. The fourth broadcast time will be moved forward by one hour, from 17:30 to 23:30. The social science lecture series time will remain unchanged, still from 19:00 to 20:00.
