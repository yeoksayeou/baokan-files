Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 5th. Our reporter reports: After the incident on August 29th in which planes from the American invading army in Korea intruded into our airspace and strafed our civilian ships, our civilian ships along the river are still constantly traveling as usual. In the week from August 29th to the present, more than 107 tons of materials essential for the lives of urban and rural people have been transported on the 70-kilometer route between Andong and Lagu Shao.

The development of China's civilian shipping business on the Yalu River began a little over a month after Andong City was liberated from the hands of the Kuomintang reactionary bandits in June 1947. For three years, the development of river shipping has played a huge role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas in Liaodong Province. In 1949 alone, the total amount of goods entering and leaving Andong City, the largest port on the river, reached more than 65,180 tons. From January to June of this year alone, more than 13,550 tons of materials were transported between Andong and Lagu Shao. Among them, most of the goods exported from Andong upstream to Lagu Shao are daily necessities such as salt, coal, and cloth; the goods transported downstream from Lagu Shao to Andong Port are mainly grain, followed by soybeans, soybean oil, soybean cakes, and firewood. In the total amount of goods going up and down in the past six months, grain accounts for more than three-quarters. This has had a good effect on supplying the needs of the people's lives and revitalizing the rural economy.

According to the current situation, it is estimated that thousands of people along the river mainly or partially rely on shipping for their livelihoods. On the section of the river between Andong and Lagu Shao alone, there are now more than 160 public and private sailing ships traveling, with a total of 643 crew members. Including their families, the lives of about 2,400 people are closely related to the water transport business.

The incident of American planes strafing our fishermen on the Yalu River this time has aroused great anger among the boatmen along the river. Many boatmen said: If American imperialism does not immediately stop this kind of unreasonable provocative behavior and immediately withdraw its troops invading Korea, the safety of civilian shipping on our Yalu River and the peaceful lives of thousands of boatmen and their families will be affected.

　　美机入侵及扫射事件发生后
    鸭绿江民船照常往来
    沿江船员愤恨美帝的挑衅罪行要求迅速撤退侵略朝鲜的美军
    【新华社安东五日电】本社记者报道：八月二十九日美国侵略朝鲜军队的飞机侵入我领空扫射我民船事件发生后，沿江一带我国民航船只现仍照常不断往来。自上月二十九日迄今一周内，在安东至拉古哨间七十余公里的一段航路中，即又运输了城乡人民生活必需之物资一百零七吨以上。
    鸭绿江上的我国民航运输事业，于一九四七年六月安东市自国民党反动匪帮手中解放以后一个多月即告恢复。三年以来，江上航运事业的发展，对于辽东省城乡物资的交流起着巨大的推动作用。一九四九年一年内，江上最大港湾——安东市出入口物资共达六万五千一百八十余吨。今年一月至六月内，仅在安东至拉古哨间，即运输物资一万三千五百五十余吨。其中由安东出口上行运至拉古哨者，绝大部分为食盐、煤炭、布匹等日用品；由拉古哨下行运至安东口岸者，以粮食为大宗，大豆、豆油、豆饼、木柴等次之。半年来，上下行物资总数中，粮食约占四分之三以上。这对于供应人民生活需要和活跃农村经济有着良好的效果。
    根据目前情况估计：沿江一带约有数千人民主要地或部分地以从事船舶运输为生。仅在安东至拉古哨一段江面上，现在往来运输的公营及民间帆船即有一百六十余只，共有船员六百四十三人，连同其家属在内，即约有两千四百余人的生活与水上运输事业密切相关。
    此次美机在鸭绿江面扫射我国渔夫事件发生后，在沿江一带船员中激起了极大的愤怒。许多船员表示：美国帝国主义如不立即停止此种无理挑衅行为，并迅速撤退其侵略朝鲜的军队，我鸭绿江上民航运输的安全和数千船员及其家属的和平生活，均将受到影响。
