　　Xinhua News Agency, September 1st: TASS, New York, September 1st: The Security Council held a meeting on August 31st, chaired by Malik.
    Malik announced that the provisional agenda of the Security Council meeting included the following items: adoption of the agenda, the Korean question, accusation of armed aggression against Taiwan (Formosa), the People's Republic of China's accusation of the US Air Force's intrusion into the Chinese border and attacks on people's houses, and the unending reign of terror and mass executions in Greece.
    Egyptian representative Fawzi opposed including the People's Republic of China's accusation of the US Air Force's intrusion and the unending terror in Greece on the agenda. Fawzi said he would vote in favor of the two items the Security Council had previously accepted, the Korean question and the armed aggression against Taiwan, but would vote against including the latter two on the agenda.
    Malik, speaking as chairman, insisted on including all the provisionally proposed items on the agenda. The reason these issues need to be reviewed is due to the situation that has already occurred in the world—the war launched by the ruling groups of the United States and currently being waged on the Korean Peninsula. Currently, there is also a trend towards a new war breaking out on Chinese territory, because the US Air Force is conducting air raids there, destroying buildings, and deliberately killing people. Malik said that today he received a second telegram from the People's Republic of China regarding these attacks.
    Malik said that he absolutely disagreed with the Egyptian representative's claim that the new items "mixed into the agenda." In fact, these items "leapt into the agenda." Life itself forces people to include them on the agenda. The Security Council must never ignore any issue anywhere that threatens world peace.
    Malik emphasized that the Security Council had never refused additional items because there were too many items on the agenda. In some cases, there were as many as twenty items on the agenda, and even now, there are twenty or twenty-plus items on the agenda, but this situation has never been used as an excuse to oppose including other items if life itself requires it.
    Malik reiterated: The additional items that the Soviet Union has proposed to include are important issues. Malik said: As for the time to review them, the Security Council will find the time to discuss the issues it must resolve. In the past, the Security Council often met twice a day, or even at night. It can meet three times a day to deal with all the issues that threaten peace and security and bring terrible consequences to the world.
    In the month of August, some delegations did not want a peaceful resolution to the Korean question, because they only invited one side of the dispute. The results of the Security Council's work in August cannot be used as an excuse not to include new items on the agenda. If they are not included, these new issues may develop into international conflicts.
    Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu then spoke, opposing the inclusion of the two new items proposed by Malik on August 31st in his lengthy speech.

　　　　Malik Points Out US Air Raids Constitute Aggression
    Cuban representative Álvarez opposed including the US Air Force's bombing of Chinese territory and Greece's continued implementation of terror on the agenda. He said that Malik raised the Taiwan issue in order to have a representative of the People's Republic of China attend the Security Council. According to Álvarez, the Greek terror issue should be submitted to the General Assembly, because the Security Council stopped discussing this issue a long time ago. Malik, speaking as the Soviet representative, then said: He is willing to explain as briefly as possible why the Soviet delegation wants to include these items that have already caused heated debate on the agenda. He pointed out: Regarding China's accusation of the US Air Force's aggression against Chinese territory, the Security Council has received two documents from the People's Republic of China. Malik briefly described the contents of the two documents, and pointed out: According to these documents, a second incident of US Air Force intrusion has occurred; according to international law, this constitutes aggression and a gross violation of China's sovereignty and territory. Malik said: The US Air Force's aggression against Chinese territory, causing loss of life to the Chinese people, is irrelevant to the Kuomintang representative who does not represent the Chinese people. He further pointed out: The US ruling group and MacArthur are interested in expanding the scope of the war in the Far East. Malik then cited the internationally recognized definition of aggression from 1933, and pointed out: The US Air Force's attack on China fully conforms to the above definition of aggression.
    Malik continued, this second act of aggression shows that the US is deliberately carrying out bombings with the intention of expanding the scope of the war. The government of the Chinese people—the victims of this act of aggression—has lodged a strong protest against the killing of peaceful residents and the destruction of property. The People's Republic of China requests the Security Council to urgently consider this issue and take steps to defend China's territory and people, and to stop the aggression of the US armed forces against China. Malik declared that this request is justified and said that the Security Council must immediately consider this issue and take steps to stop the aggression. Malik emphasized that taking action based on this protest is the responsibility of the Security Council. He said that the Soviet delegation supports the request of the People's Republic of China and "firmly insists" on including this request on the agenda. Thus, Malik, on behalf of the Soviet delegation, put forward a proposal that condemns the illegal actions of the United States and holds the United States fully responsible for the damage caused to Chinese territory by such actions and for the further consequences arising from these actions. Regarding the last item on the provisional agenda—the terror in Greece, Malik pointed out that progressive humanity and the United Nations have long paid serious attention to this critical issue. He recounted that in 1948, at the UN General Assembly meeting in Paris, the Soviet delegation raised the issue of death sentences in Greece, and the General Assembly took steps to save the lives of those convicted. Malik said that a year has passed, and terror continues in Greece. In the fall of 1949, Greek military courts sentenced eight Greek heroes who had fought against the Nazi invaders to death. The people appealed to the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union appealed to the General Assembly. The United States tried to obstruct action on this protest through procedural issues, but the General Assembly heard the voices of the world and the voice of conscience, and took steps to save the eight heroes.

　　　　Malik Asks Security Council to Save Greek Patriots
    Malik pointed out that since the end of the Fourth Session of the General Assembly, the royalist-fascist regime has continued to persecute Greek democrats. Malik recounted that the Soviet delegation had repeatedly urged Romulo, the chairman of the Fourth Assembly, and Secretary-General Lie to pay attention to the inhuman suffering of Greek political prisoners. Malik said that recently, as the chairman of the Security Council, he received a telegram from Athens stating that forty-five people are being threatened with the death penalty simply because they refused to abandon democratic principles. Malik said that the Soviet delegation and other delegations had sent letters to the Greek government requesting the Greek government to end police terror, but the only result was that the Greek government slandered those who issued the appeals. But when the letters traveled in a large circle from Lake Success to Greece, and then back from Greece, the bloody executioners continued to abuse and slaughter the Greek people. Finally, Malik cited recent letters from the mothers of warriors convicted of fighting for liberation, appealing for steps to stop the execution of the death penalty, and cited letters from relatives of prisoners with lung diseases, stating that the Greek government moved them from climatically suitable places to dangerous, humid seaside locations. Malik said that the relatives of these victims called on the world to protest and stop further abuse and executions. Malik then mentioned the appeal submitted to the Security Council by the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, requesting immediate consideration of the issue of increasing terror in Greece, and requesting action to prevent the mass execution of patriots and to improve the conditions of prisoners with lung diseases. Malik requested the Security Council to follow the humane handling methods of the Third and Fourth Sessions of the General Assembly, which had intervened and saved the lives of Greek patriots. He requested the Security Council to make urgent decisions to save the lives of those who had fought valiantly for their country. Malik declared that the Security Council cannot ignore the victims of the Greek royalist-fascist regime and must actively intervene. Malik proposed a draft resolution of the Security Council, requesting the Greek government to stop the execution of the death sentences of forty-five National Resistance Movement fighters, to prohibit further executions of political prisoners, and to prohibit moving prisoners with lung diseases to islands with harsh climates.

　　　　Austin Admits US Aircraft Intruded into Our Airspace
    Then Jebb rose to speak. He attacked the Soviet delegation for including those items that he asserted were not urgent on the agenda, for the purpose of delivering "propaganda" speeches, when in fact, it was in this speech that the essence of the problem was discussed. Jebb said: The Soviet government apparently believes that "the Chinese government's serious accusations are completely true, but without any investigation." Without any basis or proof, Jebb attempted to accuse the Soviet Union of intending to "create the greatest degree of tension between the United States and China." Jebb said: Britain would not oppose including this item on the agenda. But at the same time, he spared no effort to attack the draft proposed by the Soviet Union. Regarding the issue of terror in Greece, Jebb asserted: Never put this issue on the agenda, because it is "not a threat to peace." At the same time, Jebb made many despicable shouts to the Soviet Union, which suggested discussing this issue. Afterwards, US representative Austin attacked the way the chairman presided over the Security Council in August. Austin said: Today, when the two final items were included in the provisional agenda, the Soviet representative violated procedure and engaged in discussions on the "essence" of these two items. Austin said: In any war, there will be several accidental crossings of borders. Austin said: Zhou Enlai's accusation to the Security Council of the US aircraft's attack on Chinese territory attempts to portray "the United Nations" affairs as US affairs. He repeatedly said that the US military is supposedly fighting under the "United Nations" command, and supposedly the US military is strictly ordered to avoid flying aircraft over land outside of Korea. Austin claimed that supposedly the US military investigation showed that one P-51 aircraft of the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron "may have mistakenly violated Manchurian territory and strafed the Andong Airport five miles from the Korean border." Austin suggested that the United Nations should establish a committee to immediately investigate the attacks reported by the Chinese government and estimate the damages. He said: The US government will order appropriate punishment for those personnel who violated the border. Austin continued: If the Security Council agrees to change the wording of the proposal to: "The Accusation Case Regarding United Nations Aircraft Bombing Chinese Territory," the United States can accept this item on the agenda. Austin said: If the chairman does not accept this suggestion, Austin will make such a formal suggestion. Regarding the issue of terror in Greece, Austin insisted that seven votes are needed to include this item on the agenda, rather than seven votes are needed to remove this item from the provisional agenda. Chairman Malik pointed out that the US representative's attitude towards the wording of the proposed item on the bombing of Chinese territory had certain contradictions. He pointed out: Austin initially protested that it was inappropriate to prejudge the issue from the title of the agenda item, and Austin later suggested that the title should say "bombing by United Nations aircraft". Austin also requested the United Nations to study this issue. Malik suggested that the Security Council could avoid prejudging only by deleting the words in the title that mention who carried out the bombing. Therefore, he suggested: This item could be called "The Accusation Case Regarding Aircraft Bombing the Territory of the People's Republic of China." Austin then said: He would accept the following wording: "The Accusation Regarding Bombing China." Malik said: He is willing to accept the following wording: "The Accusation Case Regarding Aircraft Bombing Chinese Territory." French representative Chauvel opposed including the item related to the unending terror in Greece on the agenda.
    Yugoslav representative Bebler then explained that he was willing to vote in favor of including these two items on the agenda, because it seemed that the item regarding the bombing of China was generally accepted.
    Then Chairman Malik announced that if no one objected, he would include the proposed item titled "The Accusation Regarding Bombing Chinese Territory" on the agenda without holding a vote.
    However, Cuban representative Álvarez requested a vote in order to record his vote in opposition. The Security Council then held a vote and passed this item with eight votes in favor and three votes against. Cuba, Egypt, and the Kuomintang opposed it. Subsequently, the Security Council rejected the item regarding terror in Greece with nine votes against and two votes in favor. Only the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia supported including this item on the agenda. After the vote, Indian representative Rau said that the Indian representative believed that it would be appropriate to submit this item to the United Nations General Assembly under certain circumstances. However, the Indian representative was not convinced that this item properly fell within the jurisdiction of the Security Council.
    At this point, Austin suggested adjourning the meeting until September 1st. Ecuadorian representative Quevedo said that he voted against including the item regarding terror in Greece on the Security Council agenda because this issue would be discussed at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
    Malik reiterated: The Soviet Union drew the Security Council's attention to the urgency and emergency of this issue, because the death sentences of thousands of Greek patriots could be carried out at any time. He said that if the Security Council was willing, it could take action to save the lives of many people, but many representatives were unwilling to do so and therefore voted against including this item. Malik then announced that the Security Council was adjourned and would meet on September 1st.

　　我控美侵犯领空案
    已列入安理会议程
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约一日讯：安全理事会于八月三十一日举行会议，由马立克担任主席。
    马立克宣布安理会会议临时议程包括下列各项：议程的通过，朝鲜问题，对武装侵略台湾（福摩萨）的控诉，中国人民政府对于美国空军侵犯中国边境与袭击人民房屋的控诉，希腊的无休止的恐怖统治与大规模的处决。
    埃及代表法齐反对把中国人民政府控诉美国空军的侵犯及希腊的无休止的恐怖两项列入议程。法齐说，他将投票赞成安理会先前已接纳的两项，朝鲜问题与武装侵略台湾案，然而将投票反对后面两项列入议程。
    马立克以主席资格发言，坚持将临时提出的所有项目列在议程上。这些问题之所以要审议，是由于世界上已经发生的情势——安理会面临由美国统治集团发动的并正在朝鲜半岛上进行的战争。目前，在中国的领土上也有爆发新战争之势，因为美国空军在那里进行空袭，炸毁建筑物，而且故意地杀害人民。马立克说，今天就接到中国人民政府关于这些袭击的第二封电报。
    马立克说，他绝对不同意埃及代表的说法，说是新的项目“混入议程”。实际上这些项目是“跃入议程”的。生活本身强迫人把它们列入议程。安理会决不可忽略任何地方任何威胁世界和平的问题。
    马立克着重指出，安理会以前从未因议程上的项目多而不接受额外的项目。在若干情形中，议程上的项目多至二十项，即使现在，议程上也有二十或二十余项，但从未利用这种情况作为反对包括其他项目的借口，如果生活本身要求这样的话。
    马立克重申：苏联所建议列入的额外项目，是重要的问题。马立克说：就审议它们的时间而论，安理会将会找到时间来讨论它所必须解决的问题。在过去，安理会时常一天开会两次，或甚至在夜间开会。它能够一天开会三次处理一切威胁着和平与安全的会为世界带来可怕后果的问题。
    在八月一个月中若干代表团方面不想和平解决朝鲜问题，因为他们只要邀请争端的一方面。安理会八月份的工作的结果不能作为不把新项目列入议程的借口，如果不把它们包括在议程之内，这些新问题就可能发展为国际的冲突。
    国民党代表蒋廷黻继起发言，在他的冗长发言中，反对把马立克在八月三十一日所提出的两个新项目列入议程。
            马立克指出  美机暴行构成侵略
    古巴代表阿尔渥里兹反对把美空军轰炸中国领土及希腊继续实施恐怖两项列入议程，他说马立克提出台湾问题，是为了使中华人民共和国的代表出席安理会。据阿尔渥里兹看来，希腊的恐怖问题应提交联大，因为安理会在很久前就不讨论这个问题了。马立克以苏联代表资格继起发言说：他愿意尽量简短地解释苏联代表团为什么要把这些已经引起激烈辩论的项目列入议程。他指出：关于中国控诉美空军侵略中国领土一事，安理会已接到中国人民政府两份文件。马立克扼要叙述两份文件的内容，并指出：根据这些文件，曾发生美国空军第二次侵犯情势；依照国际法，这构成侵略和对中国主权与领土的粗暴侵犯。马立克说：美国空军侵略中国领土，造成中国人民的生命损失，这对于不代表中国人民的国民党代表是无关痛痒的。他进一步指出：美国统治集团和麦克阿瑟对扩大远东战争范围感到兴趣。马立克于是援引一九三三年国际上公认的侵略定义，并指出：美国空军对中国的袭击，完全符合上述侵略定义。
    马立克继续说，这第二个侵略行为显示：美国故意进行轰炸，意图扩大战争的范围。中国人民——这一侵略行为的受害者——的政府对于屠杀和平居民与毁坏财产的行为，提出了有力的抗议。中国人民政府请求安理会迫切地考虑这一问题，并采取步骤，保卫中国的领土与人民，制止美国武装部队对中国的侵略。马立克宣称这个请求是正当的。并说安理会必须立即考虑这一问题，采取步骤制止侵略。马立克强调指出根据这一抗议采取行动，是安理会的责任，他说苏联代表团支持中国人民政府的请求，并“坚决坚持”把这个请求列入议程。于是，马立克代表苏联代表团提出一项提案，该提案谴责美国的非法行为，并要美国对这种行为加于中国领土的损害，以及由这些行为产生的进一步后果完全负责，关于临时议程的最后项目——希腊的恐怖，马立克指出，很久以来，进步的人类和联合国就严重注意这一危急的问题。他追述道，一九四八年在巴黎联大会议上，苏联代表团即提出希腊的死刑判决的问题，联大采取了步骤救出那些被定罪的人的生命。马立克说，一年已经过去了，恐怖在希腊继续着。一九四九年秋，希腊的军事法庭将八名曾经与纳粹侵略者作战的希腊英雄判处死刑。人民向苏联呼吁，苏联向联大呼吁。美国力图通过程序问题，阻挠因这一抗议而采取行动，但联大听到了全世界的呼声与良心的声音，并采取了步骤救出八名英雄。
        马立克要求安理会  拯救希腊爱国者
    马立克指出，自从联大第四届会议结束以来，保皇法西斯政权继续迫害希腊的民主人士，马立克追述苏联代表团许多次促请第四届大会主席罗慕洛与秘书长赖伊注意希腊政治犯所受的非人苦刑。马立克说，最近，他作为安全理事会的主席，曾接到雅典来电，其中说到四十五个人仅因他们拒绝放弃民主原则，就以处以死刑相威胁。马立克说：苏联代表团与其他代表团曾向希腊政府致送函件要求希腊政府终止警察恐怖，但唯一的结果是希腊政府却对发出呼吁的人们加以诽谤。但当信件绕一大圈子从成功湖到希腊，又从希腊转回来时，血腥的刽子手继续虐待与屠杀希腊人民。最后马立克引证被定罪为解放而斗争的战士们的母亲最近呼吁采取步骤制止死刑的执行的来信，并且引证患肺病的囚犯的亲戚的来信，信上说希腊政府把他们从气候适宜的地方移到危险的潮湿的海边去。马立克说：这些受害者的亲戚们呼吁全世界抗议和阻止进一步的虐待与处决。马立克于是提到全苏工会中央理事会送交安理会的呼吁书，要求立即考虑希腊的日益增加的恐怖问题，并要求采取行动阻止大规模处死爱国人士，并改进害肺病的囚犯们的环境。马立克要求安理会遵循联大第三届与第四届会议的人道的处理办法，这两届会议曾出面干预并挽救希腊爱国人士的生命。他要求安理会作紧急的决定，以拯救那些曾为他们的国家英勇地作战的人们的生命。马立克宣称：安理会不能将希腊保皇法西斯政权的受害者置于不顾，而必须积极的加以干预。马立克提出一项安理会的决议草案，要求希腊政府停止执行四十五名全国抵抗运动战士的死刑判决，禁止进一步处死政治犯，并不准把患肺病的犯人移到气候恶劣的岛上去。
            奥斯汀供认  美机曾侵入我领空
    于是杰伯起立发言，他攻击苏联代表团把那些他断言并不紧迫的项目列入议程，其目的在于借此发表“宣传”演说，其实，正是在这个演说里讨论到问题的本质。杰伯说：苏联政府显然认为“中国政府的严重控诉是完全真实的，但是并没有经过任何的调查。”杰伯没有任何根据或证明，就企图指责苏联代表存心“制造美国和中国之间的最大程度的紧张。”杰伯说：英国将不反对把这个项目列入议程中。但他同时却不遗余力地抨击苏联提出的草案。关于希腊的恐怖问题，杰伯断言：决不要把这个问题列入议程中，因为这“并不是对于和平的威胁”。同时，杰伯向建议讨论这个问题的苏联发出许多卑鄙的叫嚣。以后，美国代表奥斯汀即攻击八月份主席主持安理会的情形。奥斯汀说：今天，当两个最后的项目列入临时议程中的时候，苏联代表违反程序从事关于这两个项目的“本质”的讨论。奥斯汀说：在任何战争中，都会有几次偶然地越过边境的。奥斯汀说：周恩来向安理会所提的美国飞机袭击中国领土的控诉，企图把“联合国”的事情说成美国的事情。他一再地说美国军队据说是在“联合国”指挥之下作战，据说美国军队严格奉命避免将飞机飞到朝鲜以外的土地上空。奥斯汀声称，据说美国的军事调查显示：第六十七战斗轰炸机队的一架Ｐ—５１型飞机“或可能错误地侵犯了满州领土和扫射了距朝鲜边境五英里的安东飞机场”。奥斯汀建议，联合国应成立一个委员会，立即调查中国政府所报告的袭击并估计损失。他说：美国政府将下令给那些侵犯边境的人员以适当的处分。奥斯汀继续说：如果安理会同意把提案的词句改为：“关于联合国飞机轰炸中国领土的控诉案”，美国就可以接受议程中的这一项。奥斯汀说：假使主席不接受这个建议，奥斯汀将提出这样的正式建议。关于希腊的恐怖问题，奥斯汀竭力坚持：必须要七票才能把这一项目列入议程，而不是必须要七票才能把这一项目从临时议程上撤消。主席马立克指出美国代表对建议中的关于轰炸中国领土的项目的措辞所持态度，有某些矛盾。他指出：奥斯汀起初抗议说，从议程项目的标题预断问题是不适当的，奥斯汀后来又建议：标题应当说“联合国飞机”的轰炸，奥斯汀同时要求联合国研究这个问题。马立克建议：安理会只有删掉标题上提到谁轰炸的字句，才能避免臆断。因此他建议：这个项目可以称为“关于飞机轰炸中华人民共和国领土的控诉案。”奥斯汀于是说：他将接受下列的措辞：“关于轰炸中国的控诉”。马立克说：他愿接受下列措辞：“关于飞机轰炸中国领土的控诉。”法代表萧维尔反对把有关希腊无休止的恐怖的项目列入议程。
    南斯拉夫代表贝勃勒随即解释称，他愿意投票赞成把这两项列入议程，因为看来一般都接受关于轰炸中国的项目。
    于是主席马立克宣布，如果再没有人反对，他将不举行表决就把所建议的以《轰炸中国领土的控诉》为标题的项目列入议程。
    可是古巴代表阿尔渥里兹要求表决，以便记录反对票。安理会便举行表决，并以八票对三票通过了这个项目，古巴、埃及与国民党反对。随后，安理会以九票对两票否决了关于希腊的恐怖的项目，只有苏联与南斯拉夫支持将此项列入议程。在表决以后，印度代表劳氏说，印度代表在某种情况下认为把这个项目提交联合国大会是适宜的，然而印度代表并不确信这个项目适当地属于安理会管辖范围以内。
    至此，奥斯汀建议休会至九月一日。厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎说，他投票反对把关于希腊的恐怖的项目列入安理会议程，因为这一问题将在联合国大会的会议上讨论。
    马立克重申：苏联提请安理会注意这个问题的迫切性和紧急性，因为希腊数千爱国者的死刑随时都可能执行。他说，安理会如果愿意就能够采取行动拯救许多人的生命，然而许多代表不愿意这样做，因而投票反对列入这个项目。马立克随后宣布安理会休会，于九月一日开会。
