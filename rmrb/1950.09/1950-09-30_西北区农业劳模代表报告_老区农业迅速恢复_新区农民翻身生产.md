　　Report from Northwest Agricultural Labor Model Representatives
    Old Liberated Areas' Agriculture Rapidly Recovering; New Liberated Areas' Peasants Overturning and Engaging in Production
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Northwest Agricultural Labor Model Representatives wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the recovery of agricultural production in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the production enthusiasm of peasants in the new liberated areas. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    In 1947, the bandit Hu attacked Yan'an, and the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region suffered widespread and serious losses. Therefore, the circumstances of the people in the border region were very difficult in 1948; but under the leadership of the Communist Party and you, today, we have not only overcome the difficulties, but also achieved great results. This year, Wangjiaping Village in Suide organized nine mutual aid teams with thirty-two people participating. Among them, six teams are seasonal and three teams are long-term mutual aid. The entire village turned over the millet and sorghum fields twice in the first half of the year, and all were planted. Eighteen mu of cotton were planted, 140 ridges of sugar beets were planted, 25 mu of slopes were managed, 36 mu of riverbanks were reinforced, 80 water cellars were repaired, and 70 ditches were dug. Six weaving teams were organized, with 29 people. They have already spun 236 jin of thread and woven 322 zhang of cloth. This year, the average yield of wheat is four dou per hectare, and all have been put into storage; the women have sorted out 60 bundles of wheat stalks, which can be used to weave 360 straw hats, raised silkworms to earn 2.5 dou of rice, and raised 120 chickens. Zhenjiawan in Ganquan originally had eight mules and horses, about twenty donkeys, eighty cattle, eighty pigs, and over four hundred chickens, all of which were completely devastated by the bandit Hu; but through our active production, relying on raising pigs and chickens to exchange for cattle, in 1948, the pigs prepared for the New Year were exchanged for eight cattle. Now there are more than forty cattle and five donkeys. In addition, the number of pigs and chickens has been restored to the original number. Six mutual aid teams plan to dig 140 mu of land, and have now dug 210 mu. Six women in a mutual aid team, each reclaimed twelve mu of wasteland in two years. Last year, each person harvested more than two shi of grain, and this year they can harvest five shi. Twenty-four women spinning, in the first half of the year, only two groups spun 259.5 jin of thread and wove 371 zhang of cloth. The old folks in the border area are not afraid of difficulties and are able to overcome difficulties. In another three years, we will be able to fully recover and can take a step forward. All this happiness is given to us by you and the Communist Party. Without you and the Communist Party, we could not have the current happiness and glory.
    Under your leadership, the peasants in the Northwest region have all overturned and their production enthusiasm and understanding have been universally improved. During this year, they actively launched a surge of anti-hegemony, rent reduction, supporting the army, and production. After understanding the Communist Party's policy and the spirit that all farmers in the world are one family, the peasants in Gaotai County, Gansu, established their own political power and solved the water conservancy disputes that had not been resolved for decades. They abolished the unreasonable rule on the water canals, enabling more than 6,000 mu of land that could not be irrigated to be irrigated. They smoothly irrigated more than 200,000 mu of land in the county, and saved water to irrigate more than 1,000 mu of land reclaimed by a certain artillery company and communication company of the local army, which increased production. The Luo-Hui Canal in Shaanxi had been under construction for more than ten years under the reactionary government without success, but since the liberation of Guanzhong, thanks to the special concern of the People's Government, the important project was completed and began to release water in more than half a year. In July and August, many cotton and autumn fields were irrigated, which increased the production enthusiasm of the peasants. In terms of crop breeding, the "Bima No. 1" and "6028" wheat varieties have been bred, which are particularly resistant to wheat midges and jaundice, and can play a great role in future production.
    We never dreamed that we would be able to participate in the National Labor Model Representative Conference and be warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. We must carefully learn the production methods and experiences of various places, improve agricultural technology, respond to your and the conference's call, and bring it back to the Northwest to work hard to produce, build a new Northwest, and unite under your banner to strive for the early liberation of Taiwan and Tibet.
        Respectfully,
        Northwest Region Agricultural Labor Model Representatives

　　西北区农业劳模代表报告
    老区农业迅速恢复  新区农民翻身生产
    【本报讯】西北区农业劳模代表上书毛主席，报告陕甘宁边区农业生产恢复情形和新区农民的生产热情。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    一九四七年胡匪进攻延安，陕甘宁边区普遍遭到严重的损失。因此边区人民的光景在一九四八年是很困难的；但在共产党和您的领导下，到今天，我们不但克服了困难，而且获得了很大的成绩。绥德王家坪村今年组织了九个有三十二人参加的变工组，其中六组是季节性的，三组是长期变工，全村上半年谷子、高粱翻了两次，已全部种齐。植棉十八亩、种糖萝卜一百四十畦、溜涯二十五亩、拍畔三十六亩、修水窖八十个、水沟七十道，组织纺织组六个、二十九人，已纺线二百三十六斤，织布三百二十二丈。今年麦子每垧平均收四斗，已全部入仓；妇女们整理麦杆六十捆，能编草帽三百六十顶，养蚕赚米二斗五升，养鸡一百二十只。甘泉甄家湾原有骡马八头、驴二十来只、牛八十头、猪八十只、鸡四百来只，均被胡匪全部蹂躏完了；但经过我们的积极生产，靠喂猪养鸡来换牛，一九四八年准备过年喂的猪就换了八头牛，现在又有牛四十多头、驴五头，此外，猪鸡都恢复了原数。六个变工组计划掏地一百四十亩，现已掏二百一十亩。妇女变工六个人，在两年内每人开荒十二亩。去年每人就打了老石两石多粮食，今年能收五石。妇纺二十四人，光两个组上半年就纺了二百五十九斤半线，织布三百七十一丈，边区的老百姓是不怕困难并且能够战胜困难的，再有三年我们就能全部恢复而且可以提高一步了。这些幸福都是您和共产党给我们的，没有您和共产党，我们就不可能有现在的幸福和光荣。
    西北地区的农民在您的领导下都翻了身，他们的生产情绪和认识普遍的提高了。在这一年的当中，他们积极的掀起了反霸、减租、拥军和生产的热潮。甘肃高台县的农民在了解了共产党的政策和天下农民是一家的精神，建立了自己的政权后，他们自己解决了数十年来未能解决的水利纠纷，取消了以前水渠上不合理的统治，使六千多亩不能浇水的田地获得了灌溉，顺利地浇完了全县二十多万亩的土地，并且节省出水来浇当地某部炮兵连和通讯连所开垦的一千多亩地，增加了生产，陕西的洛惠渠在反动政权下修筑了十几年没有修成，但自关中解放后，由于人民政府的特别关心，在半年多的时间内就完成了重要的工程而开始放水，七、八两月灌溉了许多棉秋田，提高了农民的生产情绪。在作物育种方面，现已育出碧蚂一号和六○二八号小麦，抗吸浆虫和黄疸病能力特强，对今后的生产能起很大作用。
    这次我们能够参加全国劳模代表会议，并受到各界人民的热烈欢迎，是我们从前梦想不到的事。我们要好好学习各地的生产方法和经验，提高农业技术，响应您和大会的号召，并且把它带回西北去努力生产，建设新的西北，团结在您的旗帜下为早日解放台湾和西藏而奋斗。
