　　Coal Mine Safety Production Model Shi Yuhai
　　——Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, Part 10
　　Production Department, Northeast Committee of the China Coal Miners' Union
　　Shi Yuhai, a labor model from the Northeast Xi'an Coal Mine, is 49 years old this year. Twelve years ago, he came to Xi'an Coal Mine from Hebei to mine coal. Years of miner's life have given him extremely rich production experience. He has always been active in his work, good at uniting the masses, and able to overcome difficulties. Because he cherishes his fellow workers as he cherishes his own life and defends against accidents as he defends against enemies, his 51-person production team has never had a fatal accident in more than three years. The workers call him "Old Shi Tou," expressing their affection and love for him.

　　Defend Against Accidents as if Defending Against Enemies

　　Twelve years of life in the pit have made Old Shi Tou deeply realize that production can only be discussed if life is safe. Especially in Xi'an Coal Mine, where natural conditions are complex, he is particularly concerned about work safety. He never relaxes his guard against accidents, like defending against enemies. He conscientiously implements the shift handover system. Each time, he enters the pit in advance, carefully listens to the various situations explained by the previous shift, and checks for any changes in the roof, sand piles, mining areas, sheds, etc., and whether they are strong, whether there are any obstructions to the airflow in the ventilation ducts, whether the wire joints are good, and whether the drilling tool bits have any problems, and whether the switches are flexible. He is very familiar with this series of inspections and has never missed one. After the inspection, he reports the situation to everyone, then allocates the work, and inspects the safety of each person's work location again before starting his own work. He attaches importance to safety regulations and has never changed or removed safety equipment for temporary convenience. For example, if the pit sprayers, rock powder beds, etc., are placed inappropriately and hinder work, he always raises opinions with the security personnel and makes changes after obtaining permission.

　　Take the Lead in Fighting Against Danger and Difficulty

　　On May 24th of this year, the sheds had all collapsed, and there was a lot of gas. He and several old workers discussed it and decided that they had to take out the coal under the shed to allow ventilation in order to eliminate the gas. Under his influence, three people risked their lives and went in to take out the coal, making the wind unobstructed, and as a result, the entire team safely completed the task of 85 carts that day. For example, the board ventilation duct of the sixth lane sent by the seventh lane of the Fuguo Mine's third pit was 15 meters long, and the gas reached two points, making it impossible to blast and difficult to work. They tied their clothes to the tip of the drill and, as the drill turned, the clothes swayed, using this to fan out the gas.

　　Cherish Fellow Workers as Your Own Life

　　New workers who go down into the pit always have the idea of ​​"mine hell" and are not at ease with their work. Shi Yuhai first assigned them to safe places at the chute opening to fill and pull the coal chute. He often told them the valuable experience he had accumulated, so that they were familiar with the technology and had confidence in their hearts, so naturally they were no longer afraid. Old Shi Tou told them: Do not dig out the unexploded cannon, drill a hole next to it to load the cannon, and blast out the dud cannon to avoid injuring people by digging out the live cannon. In order to maintain good ventilation in the working face, leave a temporary safety coal pillar at the ventilation opening to prevent sand from coming down and blocking the ventilation opening, affecting ventilation, and then remove the safety coal pillar after the sand pillar is built. In terms of work safety, he always educated his fellow workers that if stones come down when the sand is falling, don't run around, you can't escape by running, so take the opportunity to block it with a shovel or stick it to the side, or block it with a pillar leg, and you can safely avoid it. Run when the stone roof is chipped, don't look back, otherwise it will just come down on your head, because the stone roof chips quickly. When resting in the pit, try to reduce the area as much as possible, for example, sit when resting, don't lie down.

　　Shi Yuhai can also combine it with practice to educate his fellow workers. Once, a new worker tied the air door because it was convenient to push the cart, letting it stay open; another new worker wanted to make a table, so he cut off the board blocking the air door and wanted to take it to the pit. These two things seriously affected the airflow and almost caused an accident. Shi Yuhai led the whole team and spent a month, whenever they had time, holding group meetings to conduct strict mass criticism of this behavior that damaged security equipment and violated security regulations. At the same time, Shi Yuhai and veteran workers such as Wu Chengtian and Shang Xianqi repeatedly and patiently explained the importance of ventilation and carried out various safety production education. With the unity and help of Old Shi Tou and veteran workers such as Wu Chengtian and Shang Xianqi, in four months, sixteen new workers learned to blast, hoe, and pile sand, and cultivated two drilling hands, Hu Zhongfu and Li Zhi.

　　Boldly Accept Advanced Methods

　　Last year, the mine called for the promotion of a new coal mining method—using the layered longwall coal mining method to replace the high-fall (large caving) coal mining method. He was the first to respond. The next day, he held a mobilization meeting and used examples of the old coal mining method endangering life and safety while resting in the working face. He mobilized and educated the workers, encouraging them to accept the new coal mining method. After the implementation of regular mining, he used his brain day and night to think about how to find the coal seam, chisel sand openings, and rein in sand walls... He humbly learned from technicians and discussed with veteran workers. Soon he became a skilled regular mining operator. The workers saw the improvement in safety from actual experience, and they also saw that the output was increasing day by day, and their wages were also earning more, so they strengthened their confidence in promoting the new coal mining method. After his team implemented the new coal mining method, the daily output increased from 1.53 tons to 1.61 tons, and the pure coal mining efficiency increased from 3.85 tons to 4 tons.

　　Shi Yuhai, a Communist Party member, has always been a production team leader who completes and exceeds tasks under safe production conditions, and has been honorably elected as a representative of coal miners in the Northeast to attend the National Congress of Labor Models.

　　煤矿安全生产模范施玉海
    ——工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之十
    中国煤矿工会东北委员会生产部
    东北西安煤矿的劳动模范施玉海，今年四十九岁。十二年前，从河北来到西安煤矿采煤。多年的矿工生活，使他积累了极丰富的生产经验。他工作一贯积极，善于团结群众，并能克服困难。由于他爱护工友如爱护自己的生命，防御事故如防御敌人，所以三年多以来他领导的五十一人的生产小组从来没有发生过死亡事故。工友们都称他“老施头”，表示对他的亲切与爱戴。
    防御事故如防御敌人
    十二年的坑内生活使老施头深深体验到：只有生命安全，才谈得上生产。尤其西安煤矿自然条件复杂，使他特别关心作业安全问题。平日他对事故一刻也不放松防御，像防御敌人一样。他认真执行交接班制，每次都是提前入坑，细心的倾听上班交待的各种情况，并按其情况检查顶板、砂子垛、采积场、棚子等等有无变化，是否牢靠，排风道有无阻碍风流的地方，电线接头好不好，打眼毛头等工具有无毛病，开闭器是否灵活。他对这一系列的检查工作已经非常熟悉了，没有一次忽略掉。检查完了，向大家报告情况，再分配工作，并到每个人工作地点再检查一次安全，自己才去工作。他重视保安规程，从未因一时工作方便而改变或取掉保安上的设备。如坑内喷雾器、岩粉床子等放的不适当而妨碍了工作，他都是与保安人员提出意见，得到允许后再加以变动。
    带头向危险和困难作斗争
    今年五月二十四日那天，棚子都落地了，瓦斯很大。他和几个老工友一核计，非得把棚底下的煤取出，让它透风才能消灭瓦斯。在他的影响下，三个人冒着危险就钻进去取出了煤，使风畅通，结果全组才安然完成了这天八十五车的任务。又如富国矿三坑七路的板送六路的板风道十五米，瓦斯达二分，不能放炮，作业困难。他们就把衣服绑在钎子头上，随着钎子的运转，衣服也摆动，借此将瓦斯扇出。
    爱护工友如自己的生命
    新下坑的工友对煤矿总是抱有“矿山地狱”的想法，对工作不安心。施玉海首先是把他们分配到溜子口安全地方，担任充填，扒拉煤溜子。并经常把自己积累的宝贵经验告诉他们，使他们熟悉技术，心里有底，自然也就不再害怕了。老施头告诉他们：不响的炮不掏，在旁边打个眼装炮，把废炮磞出，以免掏响炮伤人。为保持掌子面的通风良好，通风口处留个临时的安全炭柱，以免砂子下来把风口堵塞，影响通风，待砂柱砌好，再把安全炭柱取出。在作业安全上，他总是教育工友，下沙子如来了石头，不要乱跑，跑是躲不及的，就趁机用铁锹一挡或向帮上一贴，或用柱腿子一挡，就可以安全躲过。石头顶板一掉碴就跑，不要回头看，不然正好冒在头上，因石头顶板冒的快。坑内作业休息时，想尽办法缩小面积，比如休息要坐着，不要躺卧。
    施玉海又能结合着实际来教育工友。有一次新工友因图推车方便，把风门拴住了，让它常开着；又有一个新工友要作桌子，就把顶风门的板子割下来，想往坑上拿。这两件事严重影响了风流，几乎引起事故。施玉海就领导全组花费了一个月的时间，一有功夫，就开小组会，对这种破坏保安设备违反保安规程的行为，展开了严格的群众性的批评。同时，施玉海和班组长老工人们反复耐心讲解通风的重要，进行各种安全生产教育。在老施头和吴成田、尚先启等老工友的团结和帮助下，四个月中，十六个新工友都学会了放炮、刨镐、垒沙垛子，并培养了胡忠福、李志有两个打眼手。
    大胆的接受先进方法
    去年，矿方号召推行新采煤方法——用分层长壁式采煤法来代替高落式（大冒顶）采煤法。他第一个响应了。第二天就开动员会，并利用在掌子里休息的时候，以旧采煤方法为害生命安全的实例。向工友进行动员教育，鼓舞工友接受新的采煤方法。实行正规回采后，他就日夜用脑子想，琢磨如何去找煤层、鎈沙口、勒沙墙子……虚心地向技术人员学习，和老工友研究商量，很快他已成为一个熟练的正轨回采作业者。工友们从实际的体验中，看到了安全情况的改善，也看到了产量一天天的提高，自己的工资也挣的多了，因此坚定了推行新采煤方法的信心。他的小组实行新式采煤法后，每日产量由一点五三吨增至一点六一吨，纯采煤效率由三点八五吨提到四吨。
    施玉海、共产党员，在安全生产条件下，他一贯是完成和超过任务的生产小组长，已光荣当选为东北区煤矿工人出席全国劳模代表会议的代表。
