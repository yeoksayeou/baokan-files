Gao Guandou and Dahu Jia Village

Under his leadership, over the past seven years, 84% of the households in the village have participated in mutual aid groups, and more than 100 loafers have become diligent producers; the number of livestock has increased from 98 to 243, and the yield per mu has increased from 8 dou of grain to 1 shi and 6 dou; this year, 72 households have built more than 110 new houses, and a prosperous atmosphere has emerged in the village.

The fame of Dahu Jia Village in Shen County, Hebei Province, is due to the emergence of a labor hero, Gao Guandou.

Before 1944, Dahu Jia Village had seven opium dens, two teahouses, restaurants, and gambling dens; there were more than 100 male and female idlers; 70% of the families in the village lived on bran and wild herbs. Now, due to the land reform in 1947 and the increased production led by Gao Guandou, Dahu Jia Village has become a prosperous village.

Seven Years of Mutual Aid History

As early as the spring of 1943, the People's Government called on farmers to organize and help each other in production. Gao Guandou took the lead in responding and organized with Gao Hongzi, Gao Laoqian, and others. During the wheat harvest that year, they exchanged labor and worked together, and the 24 mu of wheat were harvested early; during the slack season, they helped others and earned 1 shi and 2 dou of wheat. Gao Guandou, first experienced the benefits of mutual aid production.

In June 1944, Gao Guandou joined the Communist Party of China. The Party repeatedly educated every Party member to serve the people. Gao Guandou thought: If I can organize the farmers of Dahu Jia Village to help each other in production and live a good life, it will be my service to the people! So he used his unique skills of storytelling, and at night, he summoned the villagers to tell stories for a while, talk about the benefits of organizing, and introduce his mutual aid story from last year. After the publicity, farmers asked to join the mutual aid group. That year, it developed to eleven groups of thirty-seven households.

In September 1944, Gao Guandou went to the county to attend a meeting, reported on the achievements of mutual aid in production, and was elected as a labor hero. In winter, the county and district called on farmers to carry out sideline production during the winter slack season, and the county cooperative assigned a textile task to Dahu Jia Village. Based on this situation, Gao Guandou organized farmers again, developing from eleven mutual aid groups to fifty-four groups and more than 340 households of agricultural and sideline production mutual aid groups. Later, some district and village cadres did not clearly understand the principles of voluntary mutual benefit of mutual aid, emphasized clearing labor and recording work, and emphasized adding a family of resistance members to each mutual aid group, or organizing groups according to land sections, etc. Therefore, except for the seven groups personally led by Gao Guandou, most of them collapsed. But because mutual aid production has benefits, many people still secretly did not disband. Later, after Gao Guandou's individual mobilization, repeated explanations, and emphasis on the principle of "voluntary mutual benefit," the mutual aid group was restored and developed again. Now, out of the 542 households in the village, 457 have participated in mutual aid groups, accounting for 84% of the total number of households in the village.

In mutual aid and work allocation, the difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, and the elderly, widowed, and weak who lack labor were also resolved. Of the 40 military families in the village, 7 are contracted out, and all participated in mutual aid.

From then on, Dahu Jia Village sang this song:

　　"Work for work, do not relax,
　　You pull me until the sun sets,
　　I pull you until the lantern is lit."

Why has the mutual aid group in this village persisted for so long? According to Gao Guandou, first, there is the leadership of the government and the guarantee of Party members. All 83 Party members in the village participated in the mutual aid group, and most of them were elected as group leaders, naturally forming the core of the mutual aid group. Second, the mutual aid group is truly built on the basis of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Everyone has a number in their hearts, and they always want to achieve no loss for both sides. Third, Gao Guandou grasped the psychology of the masses that "seeing is believing, hearing is doubting," and always set an example in mutual aid production. Farmers saw the benefits of mutual aid and asked to organize. In Gao Guandou's words, this is called: focusing on demonstration to promote the overall situation. Fourth, check the production situation and commend model deeds in a timely manner. More commendation and less criticism is one of the important reasons for the persistence and development of mutual aid groups in the past seven years.

From "Dividend" Cooperative to Supply and Marketing Cooperative

In the past, only Gao Guandou's family weaved cloth in Dahu Jia Village. Other farmers bought a piece to wear, and many people's clothes and bedding were torn and worn out. In 1944, Guandou thought: If we can organize a weaving cooperative and use our own cotton and our own labor to weave cloth to wear, it will be cheaper! So he actively publicized it and asked his wife to teach others how to weave. After more than four months, the weaving cooperative was organized. Last year, the village increased to thirteen wooden looms, and the textile group developed to 340 households. Farmers praised Gao Guandou's good idea, saying: In the past, buying a bolt of cloth required 60 jin of rice, now using our own labor and our own skills, only 20 jin of rice is enough! In the past five years, Gao Guandou has also organized cotton ginning, lumber mills, credit and other cooperatives. However, in those days, these cooperatives mostly made money and distributed dividends. It was not until June last year that Gao Guandou led the establishment of a supply and marketing cooperative in the village that purely served the members. When it was first organized, some people said, "Don't rush if you don't seek profit; if the cooperative doesn't make money and doesn't distribute dividends, who will join?!" Party members and Guandou mobilized 28 people to take the lead in buying shares. On the third day, Gao Guandou and Party member Zhang Maorong bought some mats and salt from the district supply and marketing cooperative and sold them to the members at the original price after returning to the village. Each mat was 4 jin of wheat cheaper than at the market, and the goods were sold out before they could be unloaded. As a result, the number of members increased to 170 at once.

"Production Command"

In 1945, after Gao Guandou attended the production conference held in the original Jizhong District, he led the formation of an agricultural production research and guidance group, with 62 veteran farmers, including 6 women. They have all been planting crops for a lifetime and have experience and methods. In recent years, they have made great achievements in improving production technology. In the past, this village used narrow drills that were 1 chi 1 cun and 5 fen wide. After the veteran farmers studied and changed them to wide drills that were 1 chi 3 cun and 5 fen, they not only saved one-fifth of the labor, but also increased the yield by 2 to 3 dou per mu. During droughts, they drilled holes next to the crops with pegs to water them, and the crops were drought-resistant. They also researched several ways to transform alkaline land: one is to plow the alkaline land into ditches in the fall, which can scrape a lot of sandy soil in winter to change the soil quality; the second is to pull a layer of sandy soil into the alkaline land; the third is to plant plants that can resist alkaline land, such as North melons, cotton, brooms, etc. The 18 qing of alkaline land in Dahu Jia Village have all been transformed using these methods, increasing from a maximum of 3 dou of grain per mu in the past to a minimum of 1 shi of grain now. People call the guidance group the production command. In recent years, the village has often suffered from droughts, floods, and insect pests, and the "command" has led the villagers in a timely manner to fight disasters and prepare for famine, overcoming the disasters. The "command" also studied seed selection, seed soaking, and promotion of improved varieties. This year alone, it promoted more than 3,200 jin of Si-character cotton seeds and 6,000 jin of Huafeng No. 4 grain seeds. They have successfully experimented with the intercropping method of cotton and wheat: planting two ridges of wheat every three chi and six cun, and cotton can also be planted the following year. This method has been adopted by many farmers.

Loafers Turn Around to Engage in Production

"Cool from east to west in summer, only sunbathing in the eyes in winter," this is a vivid description of loafers by farmers in this area. In the spring of 1946, Gao Guandou was determined to transform the more than 100 loafers in the village. Village cadre Huang Laokun emphasized that he was busy with work, did not sleep at night, and did not get up in the morning, and did not engage in production properly all year round. Guandou thought: To transform loafers, we must start by transforming cadres. One early morning, Gao Guandou picked up manure and returned to Lao Huang's house, Lao Huang was still snoring in bed. Guandou woke him up. Lao Huang complained, "Why did you get up so early?" and chatted with Guandou. Guandou went for two mornings in a row before saying to him, "The county said to transform loafers, who do you think is lazy in our village?" Lao Huang said, "Huang Erwang, Zhang Quanqi, Sun Qiaopo... there are so many! I'm afraid you can't transform them!" Guandou said, "As long as you are willing to help me, I'm not afraid that I can't transform them." Since then, Guandou went for seven or eight mornings in a row, earlier every day, and went to Lao Huang only after picking up a full basket of manure. Although Lao Huang woke up, he still lay in bed. Until the last day, Guandou said to him, "People on the street are saying that I only talk about transforming loafers, Huang Laokun doesn't fetch water, doesn't plant land, why don't you transform him? Brother, you should get up earlier, so that you can influence those people and help transform them." Lao Huang immediately got up and said, "Brother Guandou, I've been working on me for a long time! I must change!" The next morning, when Guandou went, Lao Huang was already dressed. Guandou mobilized him again, saying, "It's not enough to just get up early, you have to produce!" Since then, Lao Huang has gotten up early every day, picked up manure, carried water, and engaged in production in the fields. Guandou also tried to transform other loafers, and now there is not a single idler in Dahu Jia Village.

A Prosperous Atmosphere in the Whole Village

Under the leadership of Gao Guandou, Dahu Jia Village has changed its appearance in recent years. In 1945, there were 98 large and small cattle, donkeys, and mules in the village, and now it has increased to 243; in the past, women in the village only did needlework, but this year most of the women have participated in field production; in the past, each mu of land only produced 8 or 9 dou of grain, but now it can generally produce 1 shi and 6 dou per mu; in the past, most families ate bran and wild herbs, but now farmers eat white flour during busy farming seasons, and usually eat corn buns and millet rice. Two-thirds of the families in the village have achieved the goal of tilling three and leaving one; this spring, 72 households in the village built more than 110 new houses; a vigorous and prosperous atmosphere has emerged in the village.

In the home of labor hero Gao Guandou, a fat brown cow is tied in the cowshed, and the west room is piled high with snow-white fine cotton. The east room of the main house is filled with millet, corn, and various grains. Gao Guandou said: "We have eaten and worn little since we were young. During the land reform, we were allocated 28 mu of land, and now we have built three new brick houses. Life is getting better day by day. We should really thank the Communist Party and thank Chairman Mao!" (Attached picture)

　　高贯斗和大护驾庄
    在他的领导下，七年来，村里百分之八十四的人家参加了互助组，一百多个懒汉变成勤劳生产者；牲口由九十八头增加到二百四十三头，产量每亩由八斗谷增加到一石六斗；今年有七十二户盖了一百一十多间新房屋，村中出现了一片兴旺的气象。
    河北深县大护驾庄的有名，是因为这里出了一个劳动英雄高贯斗。
    一九四四年以前的大护驾庄，有大烟馆七处，茶馆两家，还有饭店，赌局；男女二流子一百多人；村里百分之七十的人家吃糠咽菜。现在，由于经过了一九四七年的土地改革，由于高贯斗领导着农民提高了生产，大护驾庄变成了生活富裕的村子。
    七年的互助历史
    早在一九四三年春天，人民政府就号召农民组织起来，互助生产。高贯斗首起响应，和高红子、高老乾等先组织了起来。当年麦收时，互助换工，三家一齐干，二十四亩麦子早早收割停当；趁闲空他们又给别人帮忙，挣了一石二斗麦子。高贯斗，首先体验到了互助生产的好处。
    一九四四年六月，高贯斗参加了中国共产党。党一再教育每一个党员要为人民服务。高贯斗想：要能把大护驾庄的农民组织起来，互助生产，都过好日子，也算我为人民服务啦！于是他就运用他特有的说评词的技能，晚上把村里的人召来，说一会评词，讲一会组织起来的好处，介绍他去年互助的故事。经过宣传之后，农民纷纷要求参加互助组。当年发展到十一组三十七户。
    一九四四年九月，高贯斗到县里开会，报告了生产互助的成绩，被选为劳动英雄。冬天，县、区号召农民利用冬闲进行副业生产，县合作社分配给大护驾村一部纺织任务。根据这种情况，高贯斗又组织农民，在十一个互助组的基础上发展到五十四个组、三百四十多户的农、副业结合的生产互助组。后来有些区村干部对互助的自愿两利原则认识不清，强调清工记工，强调每一互助组加一户抗属，或按地段编组等。因此，除了高贯斗亲自领导的七个小组外，大部都垮了台。但因为互助生产有好处，好多人还是明散暗不散，后来又经过高贯斗个别动员，反复解释，强调了“自愿两利”的原则，互助组才又得到恢复和发展。现在，全村五百四十二户，已有四百五十七户参加了互助组，占全村总户数的百分之八十四。
    在互助拨工中，烈军工属、孤寡老弱缺乏劳动力的困难也解决了。全村四十户军属，有七户给人包耕外，都参加了互助。
    从此，大护驾庄唱出这样的歌：
    “工拨工，不放松，
      你拉我个太阳落，
      我拉你个掌上灯。”
    这村的互助组为什么能坚持这样久呢？据高贯斗说：第一，有政府的领导和党员的保证。全村八十三个党员都参加了互助组，且大部分被选为组长，自然地形成互助组的领导核心。第二，互助组真正建筑在自愿两利的基础之上。谁肚里也有数，总要做到两不吃亏。第三，高贯斗掌握了群众“眼见为实，耳听是虚”的心理，在互助生产时，处处先做出榜样。农民见到了互助的好处，就要求组织起来。用高贯斗的话来说，这叫：重点示范，推动全盘。第四，通过检查生产情况，及时表扬模范事迹。多表扬、少批评，是七年来互助组坚持并发展的重要原因之一。
     “分红”社到供销社
    过去，大护驾庄只有高贯斗一家织布，其他农民都是买一件穿一件，好多人的穿盖，都是破破烂烂。一九四四年，贯斗想：要是组织起织布合作社来，用自己的棉花，自己的功夫，织成布穿，就便宜啦！于是他一面积极宣传，一面叫媳妇教给别人织布。经过四个多月，果然把织布合作社组织起来了。去年村里已增加到十三架木机子，纺织组发展到三百四十户。农民称赞高贯斗的好主张说：以前买一匹布需要六十斤米，现在用自己的功夫，自己的手艺，只用二十斤米就够了！高贯斗在近五年中，还组织过轧花、木厂、信用等合作社。不过当时这些合作社多是赚钱分红。直到去年六月，高贯斗才在村里领导建立了纯为社员服务的供销社。刚组织时，有人说：“不图利益不赶早；合作社不赚钱不分红谁还加入呀！？”党员和贯斗动员二十八个人带头入了股。第三天，高贯斗和党员张茂荣到区供销社买了些席子和食盐，回村后照原价卖给社员。每张席子较集上便宜四斤麦子，还没等卸完车，就把东西卖光了。这一来，社员一下增到一百七十名。
    “生产司令部”
    一九四五年，高贯斗参加了原冀中区召开的生产会议回村之后，领导着组成了农业生产研究指导组，共有老农六十二人，其中有六个妇女。他们都种了一辈子庄稼，有经验，有办法。几年来在提高生产技术上创造了很大的成绩。过去这村都是用一尺一寸五宽的窄耧，老农们研究改成了一尺三寸五的宽耧之后，不但可以节省五分之一的人工，每亩地还可增产二斗到三斗粮食。天旱时，他们在庄稼旁边用橛子钻眼浇水，庄稼能耐旱。他们还研究出改造碱地的几种办法：一是秋后把碱地耕成沟，冬天能刮来很多沙土，改变土质；二是拉到碱地里一层沙土；三是种能抗碱地的植物，如北瓜、棉花、扫帚等。大护驾庄有十八顷碱地，都用这些方法改造好了，由过去每亩最多生产三斗粮食，提高到现在的最少生产一石粮。对于指导组，人们都称它为生产司令部。村上近年来常闹旱、涝、虫灾，“司令部”及时地领导全村农民救灾备荒，战胜了灾害。“司令部”还研究选种、浸种、推广优良品种，只在今年就推广了斯字棉棉籽三千二百多斤，华丰四号谷种六千斤。他们试验棉麦间作法已获成功：隔三尺六寸远耩两垅麦子，第二年还能种棉花。这办法已被很多农民所采用。
    懒汉回头闹生产
    “夏天东凉到西凉，冬天光晒眼睛窝”，这是这一带农民对懒汉的生动描写。一九四六年春，高贯斗决心改造村里的一百多懒汉。村干部黄老昆，强调工作忙，夜里不睡，早上不起，一年四季不好好生产。贯斗想：改造懒人得先从改造干部做起。一天清早，高贯斗拾粪回来到了老黄家里，老黄还在炕上呼呼大睡，贯斗叫醒了他。老黄埋怨地说：“你为啥起得这样早？”就和贯斗闲扯起来。贯斗一连去了两个早晨才对他说：“县里说叫改造懒汉懒婆，你说咱村谁懒？”老黄说：“黄二旺、张全起、孙巧坡………多着哩！就怕你改造不了！”贯斗说：“只要你肯帮助我，不怕改造不了。”从此，贯斗一连七八个早晨，一天比一天早，都是拾了满满一筐粪才去找老黄。老黄虽然醒来，仍是躺着不起。直到最后一天，贯斗向他说：“街上人们都说我光说改造懒汉懒婆，黄老昆水不挑，地不种，你不改造他？老弟，你该早些起来，也好影响那些人，帮助改造他们。”老黄立即起来说：“贯斗哥，闹了半天你是来做我的工作！我一定要改！”第二天清早，贯斗去时，老黄已穿好衣服。贯斗又动员他说：“光早起还不算，得生产才行哩！”以后老黄每天都早早起来，拾粪，挑水，下地生产。贯斗又想法改造了其他懒汉懒婆，到现在，大护驾庄没有一个二流子了。
    全村一片兴旺气象
    在高贯斗领导下，几年来，大护驾庄已改变了面貌。一九四五年全村共有大小牛、驴、骡九十八头，现在已增加到二百四十三头；过去村里的妇女光做针线活，今年妇女已绝大部分参加了田间生产；早先每亩地只打八九斗谷子，这会一般每亩能打一石六斗；早先多数人家吃糠咽菜，如今农民农忙时吃白面，平常吃着棒子馍馍小米饭。全村有三分之二的人家已做到耕三余一；今春全村有七十二户盖了一百一十多间新房；村中出现一片蓬勃地兴旺气象。
    劳动英雄高贯斗家里，牛棚里栓着一头肥大的黧牛，西屋炕上，满堆着雪白的良种棉花，正房东间放着谷子、棒子、和各种粮食。高贯斗说：“咱自小少吃没穿，土地改革时分了二十八亩地，现在又盖起三间新砖房，日子是一天天好起来了。真应该感谢共产党，多谢毛主席！”（附图片）
