Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, September 13th. The rectification movement in the leading organs of the CCP Central Committee South China Sub-Bureau, the CCP Guangxi Provincial Committee, the Guangzhou Municipal Committee, and various local committees of Guangdong Province, which began successively in June and July, has now largely concluded the inspection phase and is preparing to implement rectification at each level.

The rectification work in the past stage can be roughly divided into two situations:

The first is that the leading organs correctly grasped the rectification guidelines, that is, adopted the method of "summarizing work, analyzing the situation, and展开展开批评与自我批评" (unfolding criticism and self-criticism), and generally achieved great results. The rectification meetings of various organizations focused on criticizing the ideas of arrogance and complacency and the phenomenon of apathy among party cadres. In reviewing the failure to smoothly complete various central work tasks, everyone deeply realized the importance of policy and understood that whether policies could be correctly grasped and the masses mobilized to implement them was the key to the success or failure of the work. In examining leadership styles, it was found that the main shortcomings were: a lack of investigation and research into the actual situation, so that in carrying out work, there were often only general appeals, lacking concrete guidance on principles and methods. Secondly, due to the failure to inspect work in a timely and regular manner, the problems that occurred in the work could not be systematically handled, deviations in policy implementation could not be corrected in time, and the difficulties of cadres could not be helped to solve in time. When tasks were urgent, the method of "axe hitting chisel and chisel hitting wood" was adopted, urging at every level. This bureaucratic leadership style fostered the commandist work style of lower-level cadres. In addition, some units had many meetings in their daily work, but they did not solve problems, and meetings became a burden for cadres. Some committees had no one in charge, things were "everyone's business," and yet "no one's business." After inspecting and summarizing the work, discovering the problems existing in the work, and thinking of ways to overcome them, various tasks have been improved, rectification has been effective, and cadres are in high spirits. Their understanding of policies has been improved. For example, cadres of local and county committees in Guangdong Province went to the countryside to conduct key experiments during the summer requisition, thus promoting the overall work. Because the main problems were solved in the rectification, many secondary problems such as superior-subordinate relations, cadre unity, etc., were also successfully resolved.

The second situation is that leading cadres did not correctly grasp the rectification guidelines and methods, and the work took a detour. Some units did not seriously study the rectification instructions from higher levels, but instead followed their own narrow experience and created their own set of rules, focusing on reviewing individuals, which led to deviations at the beginning of the inspection work. Some units did not have leading cadres personally summarize the overall work, but instead collected a large number of trivial and fragmented problems, so they could not grasp the central problems and solve them with emphasis, making the rectification meetings become a formality. Some units only rectified the lower levels and not the upper levels; some units rectified both the upper and lower levels at the same time, with dispersed energy and disordered steps, resulting in little effect. The rectification leading organs issued instructions in response to the above situations, proposing to investigate central work, policies, leadership style, and various relationships as the main content of inspection work in various places, so that the above shortcomings in the rectification work of some units were corrected in a timely manner.

　　华南中共各领导机关整风
    检查工作阶段大致结束
    正确掌握整风方针的单位工作已有改进
    【新华社广州十三日电】中共中央华南分局各部委、中共广西省委会、广州市委会及广东省各地方委员会等领导机关的整风运动，自六、七月间先后开始，现已大致结束了检查工作的阶段，正准备向下逐级贯彻整风。
    过去一个阶段的整风工作，大致可分为两种情况：
    第一种是领导机关正确掌握了整风方针，即采取了“总结工作、分析情况、展开批评与自我批评”的方法的，一般获得很大成绩。各组织的整风会议，着重地批判了党员干部的骄傲自满的思想和太平麻木的现象。在检讨各项中心工作任务不能顺利完成时，大家深深地认识到政策的重要性，体会能否正确掌握政策和发动群众来贯彻政策是工作成败的关键。在检查领导作风时，发现普遍存在的主要缺点是：对实际情况缺乏调查研究，因而在进行工作时，往往只有一般的号召，缺乏具体方针和办法的指导。其次是由于没有及时和经常地检查工作，工作中所发生的问题也就未能系统地处理，政策执行上的偏差也未能及时纠正，而干部的困难也未能及时帮助解决。在任务紧迫时，更采取“斧头打凿凿打木”的办法，层层催迫。这种官僚主义的领导作风，助长了下级干部的命令主义的工作作风。此外，某些单位在日常工作中会议很多，但不解决问题，开会成了干部的负担。有些委员会没有专人负责，事情“人人可管”，又是“人人不管”。经过检查和总结工作，发现工作中存在的问题和想出克服的方法后，各种工作已有了改进，整风已收到成效，干部情绪饱满，他们对政策的认识已经提高。如广东省各地委、县委干部，在夏征中都分头下乡作重点实验，因而推动了全盘工作。由于在整风中解决了主要的问题，许多次要的问题如上下关系、干部团结等亦均顺利获得解决。
    第二种情况，是领导干部没有正确地掌握整风方针和方法，工作走了一段弯路。有些单位对上级的整风指示没有认真地去研究，只依照狭隘的经验，自搞一套，着重检讨个人，以致在开始检查工作时，即发生偏差。有些单位不是由领导干部亲自动手总结全盘工作，而是收集了大批枝节零碎的问题，因而就不能掌握中心问题，有重点地加以解决，使整风会议流于形式。有些单位只整下不整上；有些单位则上下同时整，精力分散，步骤零乱，效果很小。整风领导机关曾针对上述情况发出指示，提出以查中心工作、查政策、查领导作风和各种关系，作为各地检查工作的主要内容，使有些单位在整风工作中的上述缺点及时地得到了纠正。
