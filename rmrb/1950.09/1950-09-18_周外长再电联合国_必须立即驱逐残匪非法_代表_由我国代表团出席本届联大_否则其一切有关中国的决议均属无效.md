Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government, on September 17th, as the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly was about to convene, once again cabled UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie, demanding that the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly immediately expel the illegal "representatives" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang and immediately complete all necessary procedures to enable the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend this session of the United Nations General Assembly. He also declared that if this session of the General Assembly proceeds without the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, or if it allows the illegal "representatives" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang to remain, then all resolutions related to China will be illegal and therefore invalid. The text of Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's cable to Trygve Lie is as follows:

To Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, Lake Success, New York:

Since November 15, 1949, for the past ten months, I have repeatedly issued statements to various organizations of the United Nations: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the Chinese people. The remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang has lost any legal or factual basis for representing the Chinese people. The United Nations must expel the illegal "representatives" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Kuomintang from all meetings and institutions of the United Nations and accept the legitimate representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. However, at present, with the exception of the Universal Postal Union, the illegal "representatives" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang still exist in various institutions of the United Nations. This is completely unreasonable and violates the Charter of the United Nations.

As the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly is about to convene, the so-called "Chinese National Government Delegation" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang is still going to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly and is attempting to submit to the United Nations General Assembly a so-called "Case of the Soviet Union Violating the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 14, 1945, and the United Nations Charter, Threatening China's Political Independence and Territorial Integrity, and Peace in the Far East." This is an illegal act of impersonating representatives of the Chinese people, usurping the interests of the Chinese people, and insulting the United Nations, which is resolutely opposed and cannot be tolerated by the Chinese people. I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, solemnly notify you that the so-called "Chinese National Government Delegation" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang absolutely cannot represent the Chinese people, they have no qualifications to participate in this United Nations General Assembly, and they have no right to submit any proposals to the United Nations General Assembly. If the United Nations General Assembly should accept the illegal "delegation" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang and accept and discuss their above-mentioned proposal or other proposals, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China will consider this an extremely unfriendly act by the United Nations towards the Chinese people, resulting in the United Nations General Assembly becoming a tool for this small group of exiles of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang to slander and provoke the 475 million Chinese people. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, in addition to expressing its firm opposition on behalf of the Chinese people, reserves all rights to take action on this issue.

I once again notify you: the Fifth Session of the United Nations must immediately expel the illegal "representatives" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang; at the same time, please immediately complete all necessary procedures to enable the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend this United Nations General Assembly. If the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly proceeds without the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, or if it allows the illegal "representatives" of the remnant reactionary clique of the Chinese Kuomintang to remain, then all resolutions related to China will be illegal and therefore invalid.

Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China

　　周外长再电联合国
    必须立即驱逐残匪非法“代表”  由我国代表团出席本届联大
    否则其一切有关中国的决议均属无效
    【新华社十七日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长九月十七日于联合国第五届大会即将开会之际，再次致电联合国秘书长赖伊，要求联合国五届大会必须将中国国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表”立即驱逐出去，同时立即办理一切必要手续，使中华人民共和国代表团得以出席本届联合国大会；并声明此届大会若无中华人民共和国代表团参加，或竟容留中国国民党反动残余集团非法“代表”在内，则其所作的一切与中国有关的决议均将是非法的，因而也将是无效的。周恩来外长致赖伊电的电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国秘书长赖伊先生：
    从一九四九年十一月十五日起，十个月以来，我曾多次向联合国各项组织提出声明：中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，中国国民党反动残余集团已丧失了代表中国人民的任何法律的与事实的根据，联合国必须将国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表”从联合国一切会议及其机构中驱逐出去，而接纳中华人民共和国中央人民政府合法的代表。但目前，除万国邮政联盟以外，中国国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表”，仍存在于联合国各项机构中，这是完全不合理的，违背联合国宪章的。
    联合国第五届大会开会在即，中国国民党反动残余集团的所谓“中国国民政府代表团”竟仍然前往纽约参加联合国大会；并企图向联合国大会提出所谓“苏联违反一九四五年八月十四日中苏友好同盟条约及联合国宪章，威胁中国政治独立与领土完整及远东和平案”。这是假冒中国人民代表、篡夺中国人民利益、污辱联合国的非法行为，为中国人民所坚决反对而不能容忍。我现在代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府郑重通知阁下：中国国民党反动残余集团的所谓“中国国民政府代表团”是绝对不能代表中国人民的，他们没有任何资格参加此次联合国大会，更没有任何权利向联合国大会提出任何议案。如果联合国大会竟然接纳中国国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表团”，并接受与讨论他们的上述议案或其他议案，中华人民共和国中央人民政府将认为这是联合国对中国人民极不友好的行为，结果使联合国大会沦为中国国民党反动残余集团这一小撮流亡分子向四万七千五百万中国人民进行中伤和挑衅的工具。中华人民共和国中央人民政府除代表中国人民表示坚决反对外，并保留对此问题采取行动的一切权利。
    我再度通知阁下：联合国第五届大会必须将中国国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表”立即驱逐出去；同时，请立即办理一切必要手续，使中华人民共和国代表团得以出席此次联合国大会。联合国第五届大会如无中华人民共和国代表团参加，或竟容留中国国民党反动残余集团非法“代表”在内，则其所作的一切与中国有关的决议，均将是非法的，因而也将是无效的。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
    一九五○年九月十七日于北京
