　　People's Army units advancing south of Waegwan repelled frantic counterattacks by US military and Syngman Rhee's puppet army.

　　People's Army units advancing south of Tabu-dong dealt a powerful blow to enemy forces. In some areas of the battlefront north of Daegu, enemy forces, shielded by armored divisions, offered fierce resistance in an attempt to delay the People's Army's offensive.
　　In battles on this front, People's Army units annihilated and wounded numerous enemy officers and soldiers, including 550 US officers and soldiers, and seized two tanks, fourteen artillery pieces, ten trucks, light and heavy machine guns, rifles, and other equipment and ammunition.
　　Xinhua News Agency, September 17th dispatch from Pyongyang: A battle report released on the evening of September 16th by the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stated: People's Army units operating in the Yongchon and An'gang-ri areas on the east coast are continuing to engage enemy forces attempting to delay the advance of People's Army units with counterattacks.
　　On September 9th and 10th, People's Army units killed or wounded 220 US officers and soldiers and 400 Syngman Rhee's army soldiers in the aforementioned areas, and captured over 20 US soldiers and 600 Syngman Rhee's army soldiers. The following war booty was seized: four tanks, ten trucks, five large-caliber mortars, four 60mm rocket launchers, over twenty light and heavy machine guns, over fifty submachine guns, over one hundred rifles, three portable radio stations, and over 27,000 rounds of ammunition of various calibers.
　　In the southern coastal region, US forces launched numerous counterattacks, but People's Army units victoriously repelled the enemy's counterattacks and continued to maintain the initiative.
　　Xinhua News Agency, September 18th dispatch from Pyongyang: A battle report released on the morning of September 17th by the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stated: Enemy forces, having suffered heavy losses due to powerful blows from People's Army units in the battles south of Pohang, are retreating south and have received personnel reinforcements and are currently conducting counteroffensives under the cover of aircraft.
　　People's Army units in this region continue to fiercely strike the enemy, repelling counteroffensives and inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in personnel and equipment.
　　Over the past few days, People's Army units in battles on this front have killed or wounded over 3,500 enemy officers and soldiers, captured over 1,000, and seized three self-propelled guns, five tanks, eight rocket launchers, four anti-tank guns, five anti-aircraft machine guns, eighteen light and heavy machine guns, over eighty carbines, over four hundred rifles, as well as numerous pistols, ammunition of various calibers, radios, and other equipment.
　　People's Army units operating in this region shot down seven US aircraft and seized two US fighter planes that were about to take off at an airfield south of Pohang. The pilots were also captured.
　　On September 16th, over fifty US aircraft, taking advantage of cloudy weather, barbarously bombed and strafed downtown Pyongyang and other urban areas for nearly three hours, destroying or burning down numerous homes, schools, hospitals, and cultural and educational institutions; many peaceful residents, including women, the elderly, and children, as well as many hospital patients, doctors, and nurses were killed or wounded.
　　Xinhua News Agency, September 18th dispatch from Pyongyang: A battle report released on the evening of September 17th by the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stated: People's Army units are continuing to engage in fierce battles with US forces in the southern coastal area.
　　The remnants of the defeated US 25th Division are continuously subjected to powerful blows from advancing People's Army units, but they continue to engage in fierce counteroffensives under the cover of air force and motorized units. People's Army units operating in this area repelled the enemy's counteroffensives and inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.
　　Other People's Army units operating in the southern coastal area, in close coordination with the navy, are conducting battles to annihilate the remnants of the defeated Syngman Rhee's puppet army.
　　Xinhua News Agency, September 18th dispatch from Pyongyang: According to the General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States, after having concentrated 300 warships (including battleships) and over 500 heavy bombers and fighter planes from the US and UK, landed over 40,000 infantry soldiers equipped with heavy artillery and tanks at Inchon on September 15th and 16th.
　　As everyone can see, after encountering numerous setbacks and disastrous failures in its operations against the freedom-loving Korean people, the US military command in Korea has concentrated almost all US forces stationed in the Far East in the Inchon area. The United States is not relying entirely on its own strength; in this operation, it has also obtained the cooperation of British forces. The United States used such a huge force, which in number is twenty times larger than the People's Army in the Inchon area, and only with such an advantage was it able to occupy Inchon and advance twelve kilometers towards Seoul on September 17th.
　　The heroic Korean People's Army is fighting for every inch of their motherland.

    在多富洞以南挺进的人民军部队予敌军以有力打击。该地敌军在大邱以北的战线的某些地区以装甲师为掩护，进行激烈的抵抗，企图延缓人民军的攻势。
    在该方面的战斗中，人民军部队歼灭和击伤敌军官兵甚多，其中包括美军官兵五百五十人，缴获坦克两辆，炮十四门，卡车十辆，轻重机枪、步枪及其他装备和军火甚多。

    在南海岸地区，美军发动了多次反击，但人民军部队胜利地击退敌军的反击，并继续握有主动。
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民军总司令部十七日晨发表战报称：在浦项以南的战斗中因人民军部队有力打击而遭受重大损失并往南撤退的敌军，已获得人员的补充，现正在飞机的掩护下进行反攻。

    如大家所见到的，美国驻朝军事指挥部在对爱好自由的朝鲜人民的作战中遭遇了许多挫折和惨重失败之后，已在仁川地区集中了几乎全部美国驻远东的军队。美国并非完全倚靠他们自己的力量，在这一作战行动中，它并取得了英国军队的合作。美国使用了如此巨大的兵力，在数量上比仁川地区的人民军大二十倍，在这样的优势下它才能够占领了仁川，并在九月十七日向汉城推进了十二公里。
    英雄的朝鲜人民军正在为他们祖国的每一寸土地战斗着。
