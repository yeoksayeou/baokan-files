　　Labor Model Immigrant Li Jiang
    He originally learned restaurant skills. After moving from Beijing to Suiyuan, he humbly learned agricultural production. As a result, this year's harvest was 20% higher than that of the local experienced farmers.
    Li Jiang, who moved from Beijing to Suiyuan to participate in agricultural production less than half a year ago, has harvested twenty-five *shi* of grain and more than four thousand *jin* of yams this year because he can humbly learn production experience from local experienced farmers and take the lead in organizing labor mutual aid and intensive farming. His harvest is 20% higher than that of local experienced farmers, enough for two people to eat for two years. Therefore, Li Jiang has become a labor model among immigrants recognized by the masses. This time, he was selected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.
    Li Jiang is from Shunyi County, Hebei Province, and is thirty-six years old this year. He knew restaurant skills. In the spring, he did small business in Beijing. In April, the People's Government called for immigration, and he responded by moving to Dongbadicun, Taolin County, Suiyuan with his wife. At that time, the People's Government allocated thirty *mu* of land to him. He also reclaimed twenty-one *mu* of wasteland. After giving eleven *mu* to another immigrant, he cultivated a total of forty *mu* of land.
    The Li Jiang couple were complete laymen when it came to farming. Some local people said, "‘Kua Kua’ cannot engage in production." But he was not convinced and thought, "Just wait and see!" Li Jiang was determined to learn from experienced farmers. He first took the initiative to help the experienced farmers and patiently asked them questions about farming. Over time, everyone became more familiar. He learned farming during the day and took time to read newspapers to the experienced farmers and teach young people to read at night. Seeing that Li Jiang was a good and humble person, the experienced farmers automatically taught him various farming experiences. In this way, Li Jiang not only quickly learned farming, but also improved the experienced farmers' experiences through practical understanding.
    During the summer hoeing season, Li Jiang thought, "It's always better to have more people than just one person, let's start a labor exchange!" So he went to the experienced farmer Zhang Sixiao to exchange labor. At first, Zhang Sixiao was afraid that he would damage the crops and was reluctant. Later, he saw that Li Jiang not only hoeed quickly, but also hoeed cleaner than the experienced farmers. Zhang Sixiao exchanged labor with him. Due to the influence of their labor exchange, six labor exchange groups were organized in the whole village, with forty-seven people participating, and Li Jiang was elected as the leader of the labor exchange group. Later, he gathered everyone to go to the fields in the morning and kept accounts for everyone in the evening, and their labor mutual aid began. They not only did a good job in their own production, but also helped the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers who had no labor force to hoe the land.
    When Li Jiang learned that the local habit of hoeing was: "One hoe and one rake, come what may," he put forward the slogan of "More plowing, more raking, and more weeding." His land was generally hoeed two to three times, earlier than others. His crops grew particularly vigorously. Most of the other people's wheat had black jaundice, but his wheat had very little black jaundice. This year, the experienced farmers' naked oats yielded at most six *dou* per *mu*, but his naked oats yielded eight *dou*. Because he had the spirit of labor mutual aid and achieved significant results in production, he established a high prestige among the masses. The experienced farmers said, "Old Li is capable! Old Li is capable!"
    Li Jiang's sideline production is also no worse than others. During the spring plowing, his rations were insufficient, so he took twenty *jin* of naked oat flour to Qixiaying and exchanged it for ninety *jin* of chives. He then exchanged one *jin* of chives for two *jin* of naked oat flour. In this way, he exchanged back one hundred and forty *jin* of naked oat flour, which not only solved the rations for two people, but also exchanged for a lot of eggs to hatch chicks. During the slack season, he and his wife went to the mountains to pick forty-five *jin* of mushrooms, and exchanged them for four and a half *dou* of naked oats and bought a piglet.
    This winter, he plans to do a good job in sideline production, preparing to buy donkeys and cattle next spring, expand production, and move towards prosperity.

　　移民劳动模范李江
    他原来是学的饭馆手艺，从北京移到绥远后，虚心学习农业生产，结果今年收成比当地老户多打二成。
    从北京移到绥远参加农业生产不到半年的李江，由于他能虚心地向当地老农学习生产经验，并带头组织劳动互助，精耕细作，所以，他今年收获了二十五石粮食、四千多斤山药。他这收成都比当地老户多打二成，足够两口人二年吃用。因此李江已成为群众公认的移民中的劳动模范。这次便被选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表大会的代表。
    李江是河北顺义县人，今年三十六岁。会饭馆手艺。春天在北京做小生意。四月人民政府号召移民，他响应了，就和老婆移到绥远陶林县东坝底村。当下人民政府便调剂给他三十亩地。他自己又开了二十一亩荒，除给了另一个移民十一亩外，共种了四十亩地。
    种地，李江夫妇完全是外行。当地群众有的说：“‘胯胯’搞不了生产。”但他很不服气，心里想：“走着瞧吧！”李江下定决心向老户学习。他先主动的给老户帮忙，在耕作中耐心地向人家问长问短。时间长了，大家就更熟惯啦。他白天学种地，晚上抽时间给老户读报，教青年们认字。老户见到李江人好、虚心，也就自动地教给他各种耕作经验。这样李江不但很快的学会了种地，又把老户的经验，在实际体会中加以提高。
    夏锄时，李江心里想：“一个人干，总不如人多些好，闹变工吧！”于是去找老户张四小变工。起初，张四小怕他锄坏庄稼，不大愿意。后来一看李江不但锄的快，比老户锄的还干净。张四小就和他变工了。由于他们变工的影响，全村接着组织起六个变工组，参加的有四十七人，并推选李江为变工组长。以后，他每天早晨集合大家下地，晚上给大家记账算工，他们的劳动互助就搞起来了。他们不但搞好了自己的生产，还帮助无劳力的烈军工属锄了地。
    当李江知道了这里锄地的习惯是：“一锄一耙，死活由它”时，他就提出：“多耕多耙多锄草”的口号。他的地普遍锄过两遍到三遍，比别人锄的还早。他的庄稼长的特别旺盛。别人的小麦大多生了黑疸病，可是他的麦子黑疸很少。老户今年的莜麦，每亩顶多打六斗，他的莜麦却打了八斗。因为他有劳动互助的精神，并在生产上得到显著的成绩，所以在群众中建立了很高的威信。老户们都说：“老李能干！老李能干！”
    副业生产，李江也不比别人差。春耕时，他的口粮不足，便拿二十斤莜面，到旗下营换了九十斤韭菜，回来一斤韭菜又换二斤莜面。这样换了两次就换回来一百四十斤莜面，不只解决了两口人的口粮，还换了不少的鸡蛋孵小鸡。农闲时，他和老婆上山采了四十五斤蘑菇，又换了四斗半莜麦，买了一口小猪。
    今冬他计划好好搞副业，准备明春买驴、买牛，扩大生产，走向富裕。
