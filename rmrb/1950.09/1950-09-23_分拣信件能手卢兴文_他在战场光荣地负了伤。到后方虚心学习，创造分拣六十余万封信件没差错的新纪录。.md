　　Lu Xingwen, a Skilled Letter Sorter

　　He was gloriously wounded on the battlefield. After arriving in the rear, he humbly studied and created a new record of sorting over 600,000 letters without error.

　　Yu Jing · Xiao Liang

　　Lu Xingwen, a mail clerk at the Shenyang Post Office, is a delegate selected from postal and telecommunications workers in Northeast China to attend the National Labor Model Representative Conference of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. This is because he created a record of sorting over 600,000 letters without a single mistake in his letter sorting work.

　　Comrade Lu Xingwen is 25 years old and a member of the New Democratic Youth League. Due to poverty, he only attended school for one year and then went to work as a cowherd for a landlord. When the War of Resistance Against Japan began in 1937, he joined the local security regiment at the young age of thirteen. Later, he was assigned to the regular forces of the Eighth Route Army, where he served as a orderly, soldier, guard, and platoon leader. In 1944, he led a platoon in central Hebei and destroyed fourteen enemy vehicles, capturing over eighty puppet soldiers, for which he received a collective award. After being transferred to Northeast China in 1945, he fought many battles with the Kuomintang bandit troops in northern Manchuria, eastern Liaoning, and southern Liaoning. Eventually, he was wounded and could no longer keep up with the army, so the leadership assigned him to the Shenyang Post Office in the rear. The postmaster assigned him to work in the mail receiving and dispatching team.

　　Diligently Studying Techniques, Reciting Maps While Sleeping

　　The receiving and dispatching work in the post office involves two tasks: stamping transit postmarks and sorting letters. Doing this job well is not simple. For example, in sorting letters, one must sort thousands upon thousands of letters by route, station, and so on within a few tens of minutes, pack them up, and send them out. If one does not understand the business or is not familiar with place names and routes, mistakes will be made. Therefore, Lu Xingwen was very worried at first. He thought, "This is something that only people with considerable education can do, how can I do it?" But since the leadership had assigned him the task, he was determined to contribute to the people and do the job well. Initially, he could only sort forty or fifty items per minute, which was very slow, and some dispatchers gossiped about him behind his back. However, he was not discouraged by this and was determined to learn the techniques and culture. First, he started by studying geography. He bought two maps of Northeast China and looked at them whenever he had time. When he went to bed, he lay in bed and recited the place names on the map one by one. In this way, after a month, he could recite all the transfer points and districts of the routes he was responsible for without looking at the map.

　　In the receiving and dispatching team, some had ten years of experience, and some had three to five years, and they were all more skilled than him. Lu Xingwen intentionally approached them, discussed business with them, and paid attention to learning their working methods. Within a year and a half, Lu Xingwen's business and technical skills had reached the average second-class technical standard. He could sort large items in just one minute and thirty seconds, and small items in just two minutes and eighteen seconds.

　　Stamping One Hundred Letters, Completed in Thirty-Nine Seconds

　　Stamping ordinary letters with transit postmarks is one of the post office's major tasks. First-class labor model Gao Wanhe set a Northeast record last year by requiring forty-five seconds for every hundred items. Lu Xingwen learned Gao Wanhe's advanced working methods and increased the speed to an unprecedented thirty-nine seconds per hundred items.

　　Now, Lu Xingwen is not only able to independently sort the routes he is responsible for (Shenyang-Anshan line and Shandong), but also, due to his diligent study, he is the only one in the bureau who can independently handle the sorting business of five of the eight trunk lines.

　　Eliminating errors is indeed not an easy task in postal work. In particular, the Shenyang Post Office is the largest post office in Northeast China. Every day, no less than 100,000 letters come from both inside and outside the pass, all of which must be stamped with transit postmarks and sorted by route and transfer point. Items over ten letters must be bundled up and sent out on the train, and there must be no delays. Therefore, the sorters have no confidence in eliminating errors. Although the leadership has repeatedly called for eliminating errors, there are always six or seven hundred errors every month, and sometimes even entire bundles are misdelivered. Once, a letter from the Tonghua Electric Power Bureau requesting materials from the Shenyang Electric Power Bureau was mistakenly sent to the Northeast Bank, which caused losses to the work. From these many concrete facts, Lu Xingwen realized that only by eliminating errors could he do good things for the people, and he was determined to work hard in this area. Last year, when he first arrived at the receiving and dispatching team, Lu Xingwen always had one or two hundred errors every month when he made a summary. Of course, others had many as well. However, from early January to the end of August this year, Lu Xingwen sorted more than 600,000 letters without error, creating a glorious record for the entire Northeast postal bureau.

### 分拣信件能手卢兴文  他在战场光荣地负了伤。到后方虚心学习，创造分拣六十余万封信件没差错的新纪录。

　　分拣信件能手卢兴文
    他在战场光荣地负了伤。到后方虚心学习，创造分拣六十余万封信件没差错的新纪录。
    俞竞·肖亮
    沈阳邮政局收发员卢兴文，是这次东北邮电职工评选出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。这是由于他在分拣信件的工作中，创造了六十多万封没出差错的最高纪录。
    卢兴文同志现年二十五岁，新民主主义青年团员。从小因家贫只上过一年学就到地主家去放牛。在一九三七年抗日战争开始时，他就参加了地方保安团，那时他仅十三岁。后来才编到八路军的正规部队里，他当过勤务员、战士、警卫员，也担任过排长。一九四四年在冀中率领一排人击毁过敌人十四辆汽车，俘获伪军八十余名，受到集体的奖励。一九四五年调来东北后，在北满、辽东辽南等地与国民党匪军曾作战多次，直到身上负了伤，实在跟不上队伍，上级才把他安置到后方的沈阳邮局里。邮局长把他分配到收发组工作。
  努力学习技术  睡觉背诵地图
    邮局的收发有两种：盖经转日戳和分拣信件。要这个工作做的好不是一件简单的事，比如分拣信件，在几十分钟内须把成千成万的信按线路、站口等分拣清楚，包好转出去。倘对业务上不懂，而地名线路又不熟悉，就会出差错。因此卢兴文开始时很着慌，他想：“这是有相当文化程度才能干的，我怎么干的来呢？”但上级分配了任务，他决心为人民贡献力量，一定要把工作干好。起初，每分钟只能分四、五十件，效率很慢，有的收发就背地里说他，但他没有因此而自馁，决心要学技术和文化。首先他从学习地理做起，他买了两张东北的地图，一有空就看，睡觉时躺在被子里就把地图上的地名一个一个的背诵。就这样，经过一个月的时间，他所管的路线，不论那个转口那个小区，不看地图他都能背下来了。
    收发组里有十来年工龄的，也有三年五年的，业务上都比他熟练。卢兴文有意的接近他们，和他们讨论业务，注意学习他们的工作方法。在一年半的时间内，卢兴文业务上和技术上平均已达二等的技术标准了，大拣每件只一分三十秒，小拣每件只二分十八秒。
  一百件信日戳  卅九秒钟盖完
    平信加盖经转日戳，是邮局大量的工作之一。一等劳模高万和去年创东北最高纪录是每百件需时四十五秒，卢兴文学习了高万和的先进工作方法，每百件提高到三十九秒的空前速度。
    现在，卢兴文不单是他管的线路（沈安线和山东）早已独立分拣，由于他的努力学习，全局八条干线的分拣业务，唯有他能单独担任五条线路的工作。
    消灭差错，在邮政工作中的确是件不容易的事。特别沈阳邮局是东北最大的邮局，每天从关里关外来的信不下十万件，都要加盖经转日戳后，按路线、按转口分清楚，十件以上的都要捆起来赶车（火车）发出去，且不能耽搁时间。因此，分拣员都对消灭差错没有信心。上级虽一再号召消灭差错，但每月总有六七百件的差错，甚至还有的是整捆整捆的误投。有一次，通化电业局向沈阳电业局请求材料的信，就被误送到东北银行，使工作受到了损失。卢兴文从这许多具体的事实里，认清只有消灭了差错，才能为人民办好事情，他就决心在这方面来努力。去年，他刚到收发组不久时，每月一总结，卢兴文总有一、二百件的差错，当然别的人也不少；但卢兴文从今年一月上旬起到八月底分信六十多万封没有差错。创全东北邮局的光荣纪录。
