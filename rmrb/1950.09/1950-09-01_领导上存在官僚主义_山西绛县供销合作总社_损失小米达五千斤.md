　　Bureaucracy Exists in Leadership
    Jiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province
    Loses Up to 5,000 Jin of Millet

To the Editor:

    Bureaucratic work style exists in the leadership of the Jiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province, causing undue losses to state and members' property. I am writing to you about several major issues and request that you publish them.

    Since its establishment, the cooperative and its affiliated district cooperatives have experienced six theft incidents, resulting in a loss of more than 5,000 jin of millet. The Second District Cooperative suffered the most, losing more than 3,000 jin of millet. Once, the Second District Cooperative had fifty jin of cotton stolen, and they still don't know where the thief entered. The county cooperative's flower shop lost over 7 million RMB; the thief sat in the warehouse for half a day, and the leadership didn't notice. This shows the irresponsibility of the cooperative's leaders towards state and people's property.

    The cooperative's handling of corrupt cadres is also not timely. For example, He Tianzhuo, the manager of the county cooperative's grain department, privately used over 5,000 jin of grain from the warehouse. The leadership didn't know about it for a long time, until the masses came to expose it. Another example is Zhang Xinmin, the accountant of the Second District Cooperative's store, who alienated himself from the masses, disobeyed leadership, and misused public funds, which was opposed by the masses. However, the leadership delayed the handling of the matter for a long time.

    Furthermore, when the county cooperative's iron and woodworking factory manufactured farm tools such as wooden shovels and sickles for the masses this summer, the factory blindly produced them without prior investigation and research. As a result, the goods produced were not wanted by the masses, and over a thousand wooden shovels and sickles could not be sold. The mid-season accounting showed a loss equivalent to 8,000 jin of wheat.

    The workers in the iron factory are not united, and the leadership has not given appropriate attention to this either. The practice of beating and scolding apprentices often occurs, and the leadership does not correct it.

    It is hoped that the county cooperative will conduct an inspection to improve its work.

### 领导上存在官僚主义  山西绛县供销合作总社  损失小米达五千斤

　　领导上存在官僚主义
    山西绛县供销合作总社
    损失小米达五千斤编辑同志：
    山西绛县供销合作总社领导上存在着官僚主义作风，使国家与社员财产受到不应有的损失。现将几件主要事情写出来，请你们发表。
    该社及所属区社自建社以来，发生失盗事件六次，损失小米五千余斤。其中以二区社为最严重，损失小米三千余斤。有一次二区社被偷去五十斤棉花，还不知贼从那里进去。县社花店失去人民币七十余万元，贼子在库房坐了半天，领导上都不注意。这就说明该社领导人对国家与人民财产的不负责任。
    社方对于贪污腐化干部的处理，也很不及时。如县社粮食部经理何天卓私自动用库粮五千余斤，领导上好长时间都不知道，直到群众前去揭发的时候，才知道何天卓将麦子用了。又如二区社门市部会计张新民，脱离群众，不服从领导，私用公款，遭到群众反对。而领导上拖了好长时期才进行了处理。
    又如：县社铁木工厂在今年夏季给群众制造木锨、镰刀等农具时，该厂在事先不调查研究，盲目地制作，结果做下来的货物，群众不要，使千余张木锨、镰刀无法出售，前半季结账赔了八千余斤麦子。
    铁工厂工人不团结，领导上也没给以适当处理。经常发生打骂徒弟的事，领导上也不加以纠正。
    希望县社进行检查，借以改进工作。
                                     山西绛县供销合作社
