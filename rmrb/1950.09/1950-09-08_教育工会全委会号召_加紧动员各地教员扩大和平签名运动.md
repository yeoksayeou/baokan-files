　　All-China Federation of Education Unions Calls for Intensified Mobilization of Teachers to Expand Peace Signature Campaign

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The National Committee of the All-China Federation of Education Unions issued the following call on September 7 to education union organizations and all patriotic educators across the country:

　　The First National Congress of the All-China Federation of Education Unions unanimously passed a resolution to expand the peace signature campaign. In this resolution, it was called upon that every educator should strive to mobilize at least one hundred people to sign the peace declaration. This task was proposed based on the advantageous conditions of educators in publicizing and mobilizing the masses. If we can do it conscientiously, we are fully confident that it can be achieved.

　　Now China's peace signature campaign is developing from cities to vast rural areas, and the deadline for China's peace signature set by the China Peace Congress – the end of September – is fast approaching. Education union organizations in all regions should seize the opportunity to mobilize all educators, especially rural primary school teachers, to strive to implement the resolutions of the Congress! Complete it as a political task.

　　教育工会全委会号召
    加紧动员各地教员扩大和平签名运动
    【本报讯】中国教育工会全国委员会，于九月七日向全国各地教育工会组织和一切爱国的教育工作者发出如下的号召：
    中国教育工会第一次全国代表大会全体一致的通过了一个扩大和平签名运动的决议，在这个决议中曾号召每个教育工作者要争取至少动员一百人在和平宣言上签名。这一个任务是根据着教育工作者在宣传与动员群众方面上有利条件而提出的。如果我们能够认真地去做，是完全有把握可以实现的。
    现在中国的和平签名运动，正在由城市向广大的乡村发展，而且中国保卫世界和平大会所决定的中国和平签名的期限——九月底已很快就到，各地教育工会组织应抓紧把所有的教育工作者特别是乡村小学教员动员起来，为实现大会的决议而奋斗！把它当做一个政治任务去完成。
