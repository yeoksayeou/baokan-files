Liu Zilin in the Ten Thousand Li March
	Heroism combined with resourcefulness are the basic conditions for an outstanding commander to defeat the enemy. He is an outstanding example of a commander who possesses these qualities.
	Ge Luo, Lu Hao

	When our army reached Xinglongkeng Ridge in Dexing County, Jiangxi Province, we finally caught up with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 143rd Division. Liu Zilin and his company had already marched eight hundred li continuously day and night in the pouring rain.

	Relying on two feet, courage, and resourcefulness, the troops of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army carried out the arduous Ten Thousand Li March to the Southwest last year. Only here can one truly understand how much perseverance and loyalty must be given for each footstep forward, for each step forward.

	Eight hundred li, days of arduous combat. In these days, eating and drying clothes were considered rest. But when the soldiers heard that they had caught up with the enemy, they ran another seven li in one breath, chasing all the way to the foot of the ridge. Dark clouds filled the sky, and the rain was pouring down.

	Xinglongkeng Ridge is a precipitous cliff with rugged terrain. The 143rd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits controlled the towering mountains on both sides. Between the two mountains, there was a muddy path, and in the middle of the path on the mountaintop was a long pavilion called the Double Dragon Pavilion. In this Double Dragon Pavilion, the enemy's regimental commander and battalion commander were stationed, leading more than thirty enemies. The enemy's three heavy machine guns and five light machine guns wove the three-meter-wide path into a dense net of fire, fantasizing about blocking the People's Liberation Army's rapid pursuit.

	As the vanguard of the entire division, Liu Zilin's company had to be like a sharp knife, piercing into the enemy's heart. Regardless of the enemy's sentries, regardless of the two battalions of enemies scurrying around in the villages below the ridge, they bravely chased forward.

	The rain continued to fall, soaking clothes and backpacks.

	When they were forty meters away from the Double Dragon Pavilion, squad leader Wang Mohu was raising his hand to throw a grenade when a burst of machine gun fire knocked him down. A soldier, regardless of burning his palm, rushed forward to drag the enemy's red-hot machine gun barrel, but another enemy's submachine gun shot him down.

	The second squad, at the forefront of the assault, had a total of seven people, but all had been knocked down in the rain. Fresh blood flowed down the mountain with the rain.

	The situation was very critical. The troops were sandwiched in the middle of the mountain, with enemies on both sides.

	The rain continued to fall, and it was getting heavier and heavier.

	The brave Liu Zilin understood that the war cannot be judged primarily on the basis of a comparison of numbers. Now that the troops were inserted into the enemy's heart, if they did not attack, the enemy would counterattack.

	He decisively issued the order to charge. Three machine gunners, carrying three light machine guns, and three riflemen formed a grenade throwing team. He himself was the leader of this assault team. They concentrated all the company's rifle grenades to cover their charge.

	The charge began, with rifle grenades and hand grenades exploding in unison. Taking advantage of the cover of thick smoke, they dodged the enemy's dense fire. According to the planned scheme, Liu Zilin and the three machine gunners pounced bravely towards the front of the long pavilion, while the three soldiers of the grenade team detoured from both sides of the long pavilion to the back door, cutting off the enemy's escape route. In this way, an enemy platoon was annihilated in the long pavilion, and our army heroically occupied the Double Dragon Pavilion.

	At this time, all the soldiers of the company had quickly rushed to the front of the long pavilion, and brother units also rushed up one after another. Liu Zilin directed the troops to continue to develop towards the high mountains on the left and right.

	The enemy lost the Double Dragon Pavilion, and their deployment was disrupted. In the torrential rain, enemies all over the mountain surrendered their weapons in droves. Because Liu Zilin and his company carried out a heroic battle, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 143rd Division was completely annihilated, and the bandit division commander Yan Shangyuan was also taken prisoner.

	An outstanding commander can not only win in war with bravery, but also defeat the enemy with ingenuity. Liu Zilin, the son of a poor peasant, the twenty-five-year-old young commander, is such a resourceful and brave person.

	In November 1949, when the troops marched into Guangdong and Guangxi, Liu Zilin had been promoted to deputy battalion commander. The large army marched towards Yangjiang in several routes, and he led the vanguard company at the forefront. When he was about to reach Nafu Market west of Taishan, Liu Zilin encountered the local people's guerrillas and learned that the Fourth Security Division was stationed in Nafu Market.

	At a distance of twenty li from the troops, there were highlands extending on both sides, and the enemy had a platoon of sentries stationed on the road.

	Liu Zilin led his troops to occupy the highlands on both sides of the sentry post in an hour and a half, and then pounced on the sentry post.

	The enemy's sentry post had more than thirty people. When the enemy discovered Liu Zilin's company, it was too late to fire a shot, and one by one they became prisoners without a sound.

	From the prisoners, he learned the address of the enemy division commander, the password for the night, and other information about the enemy.

	However, the main force was still behind. Now it was a battalion facing a division of the enemy.

	The brave and resourceful Liu Zilin proposed to the regimental chief of staff that he would lead a squad to sneak into the enemy's division headquarters and force the enemy division commander to surrender. The regimental chief of staff agreed to Liu Zilin's wise and courageous proposal, based on the fact that the enemy was afraid of our army's victorious prestige. He also sent Li Xiangming, the organization section chief of the regiment, and Zhao Zhongxin, the staff officer, to go with him.

	Liu Zilin led twelve capable soldiers, each with a submachine gun, and a prisoner as a guide, and advanced towards the gate of Nafu Market. They answered the password correctly, captured the sentry at the entrance of the division headquarters, and went straight to the room of the bandit division commander Guan Zhongyue. When Guan Zhongyue and his operations chief woke up from their dreams, a row of submachine guns were aimed at their chests.

	Liu Zilin said, "We are the People's Liberation Army. You are a security division. Are you going to fight or surrender your weapons?"

	Guan Zhongyue submissively surrendered his weapons. Although he still tried to pretend to be calm, his hands were shaking. He tried to light a cigarette by the kerosene lamp, but he couldn't light it. He repeatedly said, "That's the way it is, that's the way it is."

	Guan Zhongyue finally succumbed to Liu Zilin's power. He helplessly summoned two regimental commanders from the telephone. After the education of Liu Zilin and his comrades, when the enemy's stubborn defense had come to an end, Guan Zhongyue and his regimental commanders had no choice but to agree to surrender completely.

	Liu Zilin's Third Battalion entered Nafu Market at dawn. Rows of prisoners walked out of the village empty-handed. Without firing a single shot, all the weapons of the Chiang Kai-shek Guangdong Fourth Security Division, totaling more than two thousand seven hundred people, were piled up in a school in Nafu Market.

	The heroic deeds of Liu Zilin are endless. For example, in the Dongzhangtun battle in Yichuan, Henan in 1947, the hero and his company broke into the positions of two divisions and killed 150 enemies. For example, in Shuangbanqiao north of Zhengzhou in 1948, he and his company repelled a fierce attack by five battalions of enemy troops, ensuring the complete annihilation of the fleeing enemies in Zhengzhou. For example, in the Huaihai Campaign, they stubbornly defended their position for five days and six nights, completing the task of blocking the enemy. For example, between Luchuan and Bobai in Guangxi, when chasing the 138th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's 48th Army, they had already walked more than two hundred li in one day and one night, but they still insisted on fighting, capturing more than five hundred enemies and more than two hundred livestock. The hero Liu Zilin is only twenty-five years old this year. In the twelve years of combat, he has experienced more than two hundred and fifty battles of various sizes and has been wounded five times. Here are just the heroic achievements of the brave and resourceful young commander Liu Zilin in the Ten Thousand Li March after crossing the Yangtze River. (Attached picture)

　　刘子林在万里进军中
    英勇结合机智，是优秀指挥员制胜敌人的基本条件，他就是具备这种条件的优秀指挥员中杰出的一个。
    葛洛　陆灏
    当我军赶到江西省德兴县兴龙坑岭的时候，终于追上了蒋匪一四三师的部队。而刘子林和他的连队，已经在滂沱的雨里昼夜连续的走了八百里。
    靠两只脚，靠勇敢和机智，人民解放军第二野战军的部队，在去年进行了艰苦的向西南的万里进军。只有在这里，才能真正知道，每迈前一个脚印，每向前行进一步，要交付多大的坚韧和忠诚。
    八百里，艰苦的战斗的日子。在这些日子里，吃饭、烤衣服，就算是休息。但战士们听说追上了敌人，他们一口气又跑了七里地，一直追到岭下。乌云满布，雨正下得很大。
    兴龙坑岭，悬崖绝壁，地形险峻。一四三师控制着两边层峰入云的高山。两山之间，有一条泥泞小道，山巅的小道当中，有一座名叫双龙亭的长亭。这双龙亭上，有敌人的一个团长和一个营长，率领着三十多个敌人把守。敌人的三挺重机枪，五挺轻机枪，将三米多宽的小道织成一面密密层层的火网，忘想挡一挡人民解放军神速的追击。
    作为全师最前卫的刘子林的连队，要像一把尖刀，插进敌人的心脏。不管敌人的军士哨，不管穿过岭下的村庄有两个营的敌人在乱窜，一直勇猛追上去。
    雨继续在下着，衣服、背包，已全身是水了。
    在离双龙亭四十米的时候，二班长王末虎正举手准备将手榴弹扔出去，一梭机枪子弹把他打倒了。一个战士不管烫焦自己的手心，抢上几步用手去拖敌人打得火热的机枪筒，而另一个敌人的冲锋枪却把他打下来。
    冲在最前面的第二班，一共七个人，但已全部被打倒在雨地里。鲜血顺着雨水淌下山去。
    情况很危急，队伍夹在半山中，两面都是敌人。
    雨不停地下着，越下越大。
    勇敢的刘子林懂得，战争不能以数量的对比，作为成败主要的依据。现在队伍插在敌人的心脏中，如不进攻，敌人就要反扑。
    他果断的下了冲锋的命令。三个机枪射手，带了三挺轻机枪，三个步枪兵，组成一个投弹组，他自己就是这个突击队的领头人。集中全连的枪榴弹，掩护他们冲锋。
    冲锋开始，齐发的枪榴弹和手榴弹爆炸了。借着浓烟的掩护，闪过了敌人稠密的火力，按着预定的计划，刘子林和三个机枪射手，勇猛的扑向长亭的前面，投弹组的三个战士则从长亭的两边迂回到长亭的后门，截住了敌人的逃路。就这样，敌人的一个排被消灭在长亭里，我军英勇的攻占了双龙亭。
    这时候，全连的战士已经迅速冲到长亭跟前，兄弟部队也陆续冲上来了。刘子林指挥着队伍向左右两侧高山继续发展。
    敌人失去了双龙亭，部署被打乱了。在滂沱大雨里，满山的敌人，成群成群地交出自己的武器。由于刘子林和他的连队进行了英勇的战斗，蒋匪一四三师遂告全部歼灭，匪军师长阎尚元也当了俘虏。
    一个优秀的指挥员，不但能在战争中以勇猛取胜，而且还能用机智打败敌人。贫农的儿子，二十五岁的年青的指挥员刘子林，就是这样一个智勇双全的人。
    一九四九年十一月，当部队进军两广的时候，刘子林已升任为副营长。大军分数路向阳江挺进，他带领前卫连，走在最前面。在快要到达台山以西的那夫圩时，刘子林碰到了当地人民游击队，知道了保安第四师驻扎在那夫圩的消息。
    在相距部队二十里的地方，两旁有高地延伸，而敌人有一个排哨放在公路上。
    刘子林带领部队，一个半钟头以后，占领了排哨两边的高地，然后向排哨猛扑。
    敌人的排哨有三十多个人。当敌人发现刘子林的连队时，已来不及打枪，一声不响，就一个一个当了俘虏。
    从俘虏嘴里，知道了敌人师长的住址、晚上的口令以及敌人其他的情况。
    但是，主力尚在后面。现在是一个营，面对着一个师的敌人。
    勇敢机智的刘子林，向团参谋长提议自己带领一个班，摸到敌人的师部去，逼迫敌人的师长投降。团的参谋长根据敌人慑于我军胜利的声威，答应了刘子林这个智勇的建议。并派团组织股长李向明、参谋赵忠信和他同去。
    刘子林带领了十二个精干的战士，每人一枝冲锋枪，由俘虏作向导，向那夫圩的寨门前进。他们答对了口令，俘虏了师部门口的哨兵，他们就直奔匪师长关中岳的房间。关中岳和他的作战课长从睡梦中惊醒的时候，一排冲锋枪的枪口正对准他们的胸膛。
    刘子林说：“我们是解放大军，你们是个保安师，是打还是缴枪？”
    关中岳驯从地缴了械。虽然他还要装作镇静，他两手发抖，对着煤油灯，要想抽烟，但烟也点不着。他连说：“事实就是这样，事实就是这样。”
    关中岳终于屈服在刘子林的威力之下，他无可奈何地从电话上召来了两个团长，经过刘子林和他的战友们的教育，当敌人固守已告绝望，关中岳和他的团长们只好答应全部投降。
    刘子林的第三营在天亮的时候进驻那夫圩，成排的俘虏们徒手走出村庄，我军不费一枪一弹，蒋匪广东保安第四师全部二千七百多人的武器，都满堆在那夫圩的一个学校里。
    英雄刘子林的事迹是写不完的。像在一九四七年河南伊川的东章屯战斗中，英雄和他的连队，突入了两个师的阵地，击毙了敌人一百五十名。像一九四八年在郑州以北的双板桥，他和他的连队击退了敌军五个营的兵力猛扑，保证全歼郑州的逃敌。像在淮海战役中，五天六夜顽强地坚守了自己的阵地，完成了阻击任务。像在广西陆川、博白之间，追击蒋匪四八军一三八师的时候，已经是一天一夜走了二百多里，但还是坚持进行战斗，俘虏了五百多敌人，二百多头牲口。英雄刘子林，今年才二十五岁，在十二年的战斗中，经历了大小二百五十多次战斗，身上曾负过五次伤。这里，仅是英勇机智的青年指挥员刘子林在渡江以后万里进军中的英雄业迹。（附图片）
