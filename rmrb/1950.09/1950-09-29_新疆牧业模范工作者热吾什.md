　　Rewush, a Kazakh livestock expert, is the head of the Xinjiang Yining District Livestock Farm and a model worker who has weathered many storms and dedicated himself to the livestock industry. He has been engaged in animal husbandry and veterinary work for eight years, applying progressive scientific theories and technologies to the livestock industry of the masses. He leads more than 200 employees of the Xinjiang Yining District Livestock Farm in transforming the local livestock industry into a new look. The mortality rate of livestock has been greatly reduced; inferior breeds have gradually become superior breeds; and breeding has accelerated. Extensive treatment and prevention work has been carried out for livestock diseases among the vast number of Xinjiang herdsmen, protecting their only property (livestock) and ensuring the lives of the herdsmen.

　　The Yining Livestock Farm has introduced fine breeds of horses, cattle, and sheep from the Soviet Union to cross with local breeds. By the sixth generation, they are similar to the Soviet fine breeds. According to statistics from the First and Second Farms of the Yining Livestock Farm this year: the stud farm has a total of 1,494 horses, including 5 Soviet stud horses, and has now bred 1,030 fine horses. The breeding cattle farm has a total of 456 cattle, including 7 Soviet breeding cattle, and also has 275 improved cattle. The first and second breeding sheep farms have a total of 31,652 sheep, of which 24,833 are Soviet breeding sheep. In addition, artificial insemination is widely used for sheep breeding. According to last year's statistics, 4,946 sheep were artificially inseminated, and this year's plan aims to reach 10,000. Preparations are also being made to widely apply the scientific method of artificial insemination to cattle breed improvement.

　　In the pasture, because the feed is properly allocated and the management is thorough and scientific, the local breeds raised in the farm are also taller and stronger than the average livestock in the area. In this regard, Rewush and his partners adhere to Michurin's theory that "the characteristics of a certain animal or plant that have been formed or changed due to acquired environment can be inherited through heredity" and follow the path of Michurin, thus achieving brilliant achievements. In terms of livestock disease prevention and treatment, he and his partners have made remarkable achievements. From last year to June this year, 453,577 heads of sick livestock in twelve counties have been cured. At least 500 heads of sick livestock are treated every day, and the number of livestock vaccinated is even greater. The farm has been continuously expanding in terms of cultivating breeding livestock. Among the herdsmen in the Yining area of Xinjiang, the breeding cattle, stud horses, and breeding sheep cultivated by the farm have become widespread. When the herdsmen lead these glossy, strong, and energetic livestock, they often think of Rewush.

　　Rewush's family only had one horse in his childhood and mainly relied on his father's wooden bowl making to make a living. When he was in elementary school in Yili, he was a semi-pastoral and semi-studying student.

　　At the age of nine, Rewush transferred to the public school in Almaty. Here, he learned chemistry, biology, and especially animal husbandry, which he had a special interest in. Ten years of effort laid the foundation for him to continue his studies. After graduation, he was admitted to the Almaty University of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine. During the four years of arduous university life, he also worked hard, working as a worker in a brick kiln and as a feeder and servant in the veterinary hospital affiliated to the University of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine. It was also during this period that he came into contact with socialist ideas and began to have a preliminary understanding of the Soviet Union. As he said, "At the university, I learned two subjects. In natural science, I learned about Michurin's theory; in social science, I experienced the path taken by the Soviet Union."

　　In 1942, after graduating from university, Rewush returned to the Yili Veterinary Hospital to work as a veterinarian. During the six or seven years under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, he was very dissatisfied with the reactionaries, but Rewush did not become discouraged because of this. On the contrary, he continued to persist in his arduous career. After liberation last year, he was promoted to the head of the Yining District Livestock Farm. In his work, he relies closely on the masses and often studies all issues of the farm with everyone. He said: The wisdom of the masses is abundant, and we should learn from them.

　　新疆牧业模范工作者热吾什
    天云
    哈萨克族的畜牧专家——热吾什，是新疆伊宁区畜牧场的场长，也是一位饱经风霜、兢兢业业于畜牧事业的模范工作者。他从事畜牧、兽医工作已八年之久；他把进步的科学的理论知识与技术运用到群众的畜牧事业上去。他领导着新疆伊宁区畜牧场二百余名职工把当地的畜牧事业改变为一个新的面貌。牲畜死亡率已大大的减少了；低劣的品种也渐渐变为优良品种了；繁殖也加快了起来。广大的新疆牧民的牲畜，已进行了普遍的畜病治疗与防疫工作，保障了他们唯一的财产（牲畜），也保障了牧民们的生活。
    伊宁畜牧场曾从苏联引入马、牛、羊等优良畜种与当地土种进行杂交，至第六代即与苏联的良种相似。据伊宁畜牧场一、二两场今年统计：种马厂共有马一千四百九十四匹，苏联种马五匹，现已培育骏马一千零三十匹。种牛厂共有牛四百五十六头，苏联种牛七头，改良牛亦有二百七十五头。种羊一、二厂共有羊三万一千六百五十二只，培育苏联种羊则有二万四千八百三十三只。此外，羊子配种，普遍实行了人工授精法，据去年一年统计，用人工授精的即有四千九百四十六只，今年计划争取到一万只。并准备将人工授精的科学方法，普遍运用到牛种改良上。
    在牧场中，因为饲料调配适当及管理的周密与科学化，该场所养育的土种畜，亦较当地一般牲畜高大强壮。在这点上，热吾什和他的伙伴们，是信守着米邱林关于“某种动植物，因后天环境而养成或改变了的特性，能够借着遗传而遗传下去”的学说，并遵循着米邱林的道路，因而获得了辉煌的成就。在牲畜的防疫与疾病医疗上，他和他的伙伴们创造了显著的成绩，从去年至今年六月，十二县医好病畜达四十五万三千五百七十七头。每天至少医疗病畜五百头以上，平时经防疫注射的牲畜数目更多了。该场在培养种畜方面，连年来不断的扩展着，新疆伊宁区一带的牧民中间，普遍获得了该场所培育的种牛、种马和种羊，牧民们当牵着这些毛色润泽、力强体壮、精神旺盛的牲畜时，就常常想着热吾什了。
    热吾什幼年时代的家庭，只有着一匹马的财产，主要靠父亲制造木碗来维持生活。他在伊犁上小学的时候，是一个半牧半读的学生。
    热吾什九岁又转入阿拉木图公费学校读书，在这里他学到了化学、生物，特别是对他有着特殊兴趣的畜牧学。整十年的努力，奠定了他继续深造的基础。毕业后，他考入阿拉木图的畜牧兽医大学。在四年的大学艰苦岁月中，他一直兼做着苦役，曾当过砖瓦窑的工人，也做过畜牧兽医大学的附设兽医医院中的饲养员、勤务员。也就在这期间，他接触到了社会主义的思想，开始对苏联这个国度有了初步认识，正如他所说：“在大学里，我学到了两门学问，在自然科学里，我认识了米邱林学说；在社会科学里，我体验到了苏联所走的道路。”
    一九四二年热吾什在大学毕业后回到伊犁兽医医院担任兽医职务。他在国民党反动统治下的六、七年中，他对反动派非常不满，但热吾什并未因此而颓丧，相反的他一直仍在坚持着他的艰苦的事业。去年解放后，他即被升任为伊宁区畜牧场场长。他在工作中是紧紧地依靠群众，经常和大家一起研究牧场一切问题。他说：群众的智慧是丰富的，我们应当向他们学习。（附图片）
