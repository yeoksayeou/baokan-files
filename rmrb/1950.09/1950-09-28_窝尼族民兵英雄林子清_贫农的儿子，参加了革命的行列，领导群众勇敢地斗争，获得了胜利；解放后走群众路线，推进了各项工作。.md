    Woni Ethnic Militia Hero Lin Ziqing
    Son of a Poor Peasant, Joined the Ranks of the Revolution, Led the Masses in Courageous Struggle, and Won Victory; After Liberation, Followed the Mass Line and Promoted Various Tasks.
    "I didn't plan to be a hero. In fact, I still feel that I'm not good enough and must work hard to improve myself. As for participating in the revolution, it was initially just because my family was too poor, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' government forced us to the point where we couldn't survive. I wanted to make a better life for myself." This is a passage of halting Mandarin that Comrade Lin Ziqing spoke at the beginning. It seems too modest, but from his pure and honest expression, I am convinced that these words are entirely true.
    In early 1948, when Dong Zhian, the principal of Eshan County Middle School in Yunnan Province—a Communist Party member—led students in revolutionary activities against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits' conscription of soldiers, grain, and money, Lin Ziqing, a son of a poor peasant from the Woni ethnic group in Abaozu Village in the suburbs, was recruited into the revolutionary ranks. At that time, Lin Ziqing, who had been a shepherd for Lin Dazhong, a rich peasant in Abaozu, felt that although he had finished elementary school with the money his parents earned from selling firewood, what use was it?! Impoverished days could no longer continue, and he had to resist grain and conscription, hoping for a better life. However, Dong Zhian and the others were troubled by the fact that no one could speak the Woni language, which caused a certain degree of delay in their work in the suburbs. Therefore, when Dong Zhian talked to Lin Ziqing, in addition to his revolutionary determination, it was also because he was a Woni person in Abaozu who understood Mandarin.
    Comrade Lin Ziqing said: The organized revolutionary work began with the establishment of a committee to liquidate the pseudo-Bao chief Lin Tiqun. That was established through individual coordination. At that time, only ten people participated in this meeting, most of whom were unable to make a living because the Bao chief had forced them to conscript soldiers and pay money.
    Our hero, Lin Ziqing, from the beginning adopted the method of propaganda and organization in parallel to organize the masses. What moved the masses the most was that he used his own wages to buy lamp oil, books, pens, and paper to run a night literacy class in the village. The masses worked during the day and attended literacy classes at night. Lin Ziqing, along with the activists of the liquidation committee, was with the masses at all times and in all places. In this way, after half a year of hard work, he gained the love of the masses. Then, Comrade Lin Ziqing formed farmers' associations, women's associations, and Young Pioneers through the literacy class, and led them in an organized way to carry out the liquidation struggle against the Kuomintang bandit gang's "three conscriptions."
    Once the masses were organized, they became an invincible force. The Woni people of Abaozu Village, led by Lin Ziqing, henceforth seized political power, and the village farmers' association became the core of the temporary village government. The strong and heroic Woni people "jumped for joy" (a kind of Woni dance) to their hearts' content on the edge of the village. They sang: "From ancient times to the present, there has not been a good day. Today we are liberated, let's all sing."
    In the spring of the second year, the Chiang Kai-shek 26th Army came to Eshan County. Under the command of this bandit army, local bandits and special agents in neighboring areas combined with landlords to riot everywhere. What a serious threat this was to the people of Abaozu! At that time, there was only one armed work team in the entire Eshan County. The clever Lin Ziqing, seeing this change in the situation, immediately changed his organization, formed the young and strong people into a powerful militia team, and mobilized the masses to clear the houses and fields, strictly guard the sentry posts, and block the news. He also formed a secret group, selecting a group leader for every five households. No matter who had guests staying overnight, they had to report to the farmers' association first. In the hearts of the revolutionary people of Abaozu, the dividing line between the enemy and us was dug deeper and wider. The enemy never had a chance to take advantage of them, and Abaozu was safe.
    What the masses love are people with talent and a genuine desire to serve them. Now Comrade Lin Ziqing has been elected as the chairman of the joint village government and the militia captain.
    In April and May, he led the militia to capture two high-ranking Chiang Kai-shek special agents and one female special agent, and successively repelled the harassment of the bandit Wang Fangxiong, thwarting the enemy's special agents' evil plan to organize riots and destroy the lives of the Woni people.
    The brilliant work achievements and the excellent quality of wholeheartedly serving the people made Lin Ziqing gloriously join the Communist Party of China in August of that year.
    Heroes are often born in arduous tasks. In 1950, in the Southwest region, the first major task for government cadres was to collect grain. Comrade Lin Ziqing revealed his surpassing talent here.
    In March, when the county arranged the grain collection work, some people at the meeting emphasized the objective difficulties and expressed a lack of confidence. But Comrade Lin Ziqing did not think that way. He felt that if a person facing difficulties in the victory of the revolution did not emphasize subjective initiative to overcome them, but instead frightened himself with difficulties, it would be putting the cart before the horse. Therefore, he immediately expressed his guarantee to complete the task and immediately took up the battle.
    Lin Ziqing's method was for himself and all the activists to take the lead in paying grain as an example. At the same time, they persuaded and educated their relatives and friends, clearing their minds. But it must be done sincerely and voluntarily, and only after paying grain automatically, then mobilize relatives and friends to find relatives and friends, carrying out propaganda and organization in parallel to set off a wave of enthusiasm. Lin Ziqing first found Lin Guoliang, a middle peasant who never asked about things, persuaded him, let him pay grain automatically, and then praised him. As a result, Lin Guoliang also actively persuaded others. This matter had a great driving effect. According to Comrade Lin Ziqing, the reason they persuaded the masses was just to explain to the masses: "It has never been the case that grain is not given, but think about who it is given to? In the past, it was given to the Kuomintang, who oppressed us and harmed us after eating it. We were too wronged, and it should not have been given. Now it is given to the People's Government, which was established by ourselves and serves us. Isn't this completely right?! It's like giving food to your own son. Can you just ask your son to farm without letting him eat?!"
    Lin Ziqing tirelessly talked about such simple truths day and night. In the fields, in the houses, on the cliffs where firewood was cut, in the forests where cattle were grazed, wherever there were masses, Lin Ziqing could be seen helping the masses with their work while talking. In less than a month, the entire joint village's grain collection task was overfulfilled.
    However, the grain collection work in the lower Nan district was completely rigid. The peasants did not understand the Party's policies and watched hesitantly. The Party transferred Comrade Lin Ziqing to carry out work here.
    On the first day, Lin Ziqing met the peasant Jin Chaofu who was digging in the field, so he kindly went to help him dig. In the conversation, he learned that the difficulty of the grain collection work in the lower Nan district was mainly caused by the bureaucratism and commandism of Comrade Jin who had been working here. After obtaining the approval of his superiors, he first convened a cadres' meeting. At the meeting, he focused on reviewing Comrade Jin's personal bureaucratic and commanding style, explained the policies of the Party and the People's Government, and released the activist Jin Qizhong. Finally, he explained the truth about grain collection again and proceeded according to the method of Abaozu. The masses were very satisfied. Within a month, they completed 80% of the grain collection task.
    At this point, Comrade Lin Ziqing said in his very labored Mandarin:
    "That's all. These are all things done by the masses, and I myself need a lot of improvement." (Attached picture)

　　窝尼族民兵英雄林子清
    贫农的儿子，参加了革命的行列，领导群众勇敢地斗争，获得了胜利；解放后走群众路线，推进了各项工作。
    “我并没有打算当英雄，其实，现在我也觉得自己很不行，一定要努力在工作中锻炼。至于参加革命，起初那只是因为家里太穷苦，叫蒋匪政府逼得没法过下去，想闹个好日月。”这是林子清同志开头讲的一段生硬的汉话。看来似乎太谦虚，可是，从他纯洁而诚实的神情中确信这话是全然真实的。
    当一九四八年初，云南省峨山县中学校长——共产党员董治安带领学生，进行反蒋匪征兵、征粮、征款的革命活动时，城郊区阿保祖村，窝尼族一个贫农的儿子——林子清，被他们吸收到革命的行列中。当时，曾经做过阿保祖富农林大忠牧童的林子清，感到自己虽然用父母卖柴的钱念完了小学，但这有什么用呢？！穷困日子已经不能继续生活下去，必须抗粮、抗丁，望个好日月。而董治安他们却正苦于无人能通窝尼族的语言，使工作在城郊区发生了一定程度的迟滞。因而当董治安找林子清谈话时，除掉他的思想上有革命的决心等条件外，还因为他在阿保祖是一个懂得汉话的窝尼人。
    林子清同志说：有组织的革命工作，开头是成立清算伪保长林体群的委员会。那是经过个别串通建立起来的。当时参加这个会的只有十个人，大部都是被保长抓丁逼款无法过活的。
    我们的英雄林子清，一开始就采用了宣传与组织并进的办法去组织群众。群众最受感动的，是他用自己卖工的钱卖灯油、书、笔和纸张，在村里开办夜间识字班。群众白天做生活，晚间上识字班。林子清带着他们清算委员会的积极分子，随时随地和群众在一起，这样，经过半年的艰苦工作，获得了群众爱戴。于是林子清同志通过识字班组成了农会、妇会和少先队，有组织有领导的向国民党匪帮进行反“三征”的清算斗争。
    群众一经组织起来，便成为不可战胜的力量。林子清所领导的阿保祖村的窝尼族人，从此取得了政权，村农会成为临时村政的核心。强悍而豪爽的窝尼族人，在村边尽情的“跳乐”（是窝尼族的一种舞蹈）了，他们唱着：“从古到现在，没有好一天，今天得解放，大家来唱唱。”
    第二年的春天，蒋匪二十六军来到峨山县，在这支匪军支使下，邻区土匪特务结合地主四处暴动。这对于阿保祖的人民是何等严重的威胁？当时峨山全县只有一支武工队。聪明的林子清，看到这种情势的变化，立即改变了自己的组织，把青壮年编成一支强有力的民兵队，并动员群众空室清野，严密岗哨，封锁消息。又另外组成机密小组，每五家选一组长，不管谁家有客过夜，必须先报告农会。在革命的阿保祖人民心里，把敌我的界沟挖的又深又宽。敌人始终无隙可乘，阿保祖得到了平安。
    群众爱戴的是有才能又有真心替群众办事的人。现在林子清同志被选为联合村政府主席兼民兵队长。
    四、五月间他带领民兵捉过两个蒋匪高级特务和一个女特务，并连续打退土匪王芳雄的骚扰，挫败了敌特组织暴动，破坏窝尼人民生活的恶毒计划。
    辉煌的工作成绩和诚心诚意为人民服务的优良品质，使林子清在这年八月里光荣的参加了中国共产党。
    英雄往往在艰巨的任务中产生。一九五○年在西南地区，对于政权干部来说，首先接触的巨大任务是筹粮。林子清同志在这里显露了他超越的才能。
    三月间，县里布置筹粮工作时，会议上有一些人强调了客观困难，表示信心不够。而林子清同志却不是那样想。他觉得一个人对于革命胜利中的困难，如果不强调主观能动性去战胜它，反而以困难吓唬自己，那是本末倒置的想法。所以他当场表示保证完成任务，并立时挑起战来。
    林子清的办法是自己和全体积极分子首先以身作则带头缴粮，同时各找亲朋说服教育、打通思想。但必须做到心悦诚服，自动缴粮之后，再动员亲朋找亲朋，宣传与组织双管齐下，以掀起热潮。林子清首先找到从来不问事的中农林国良，说服了他，让他自动缴了粮，就给以表扬。于是林国良也积极去劝起别人来。这件事所起的推动作用很大。他们说服群众的理由，据林子清同志讲，只是向群众说明：“不出粮是自古以来没有的，但看出给谁吃？从前出给国民党，他们吃了压迫我们，残害我们，我们太冤枉，那是不该出的。现在出给人民政府，人民政府是咱们自己成立的，给咱们自己办事，这不是完全应该吗？！就像自己给自己的儿子吃饭是一样，难道你能只叫儿子去种田，不叫儿子吃饭吗？！”
    就这样简单的道理，林子清同志日日夜夜不知倦怠的讲说着。在田里，在屋里，在砍柴的悬崖上，在放牛的林子里，只要有群众的地方，都可能看到林子清同志一面帮群众劳作，一面讲说着。不到一个月，整个联合村的筹粮任务超额完成。
    然而在下南区的筹粮工作，确是全然僵硬的。农民对党的政策不了解。迟疑的观望着。党调林子清同志到这里开展工作。
    林子清第一天就碰到农民晋朝富正在挖田，于是他亲切地去帮他挖起来。闲谈中了解到下南区筹粮工作的困难，主要是原来在这里工作的靳同志的官僚主义与命令主义所造成的。他在取得上级同意后，首先召开了干部大会。会上着重检讨了靳同志个人官僚主义、命令主义的作风，解释了党和人民政府的政策，释放了积极分子晋其中。最后又把筹粮的道理讲了一遍，按照阿保祖的办法进行起来。群众很满意。一月之内，他们完成了百分之八十的筹粮任务。
    到这里，林子清同志用他很吃力的汉话这样说：
    “完了。这都是群众做的事，我自己是很需要锻炼的。”（附图片）
