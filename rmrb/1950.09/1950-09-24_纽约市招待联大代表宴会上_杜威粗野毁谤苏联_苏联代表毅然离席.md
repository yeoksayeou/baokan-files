Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 23rd: TASS, New York, September 23rd: The New York City government hosted a banquet today at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel to welcome delegates from various countries attending the United Nations General Assembly. At the banquet, New York Governor Dewey, as the representative of the host country of this session of the General Assembly, displayed unprecedentedly rude behavior. It was originally thought that Dewey, as the Governor of New York State, should show sincere welcome to the visiting delegations, but this basic courtesy was apparently foreign to Dewey. In his "welcome speech," Dewey began with vicious slander against the Soviet Union. As soon as Dewey uttered the first insulting words, Vyshinsky, Malik, and other members of the Soviet delegation immediately left their seats and walked out of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Dewey's rude behavior even aroused the indignation of Philippine representative Romulo, who had to indirectly rebuke Dewey when he rose to speak after Dewey. Other delegates attending the banquet also expressed disapproval of Dewey's actions. The New York Times stated that some guests at the banquet privately expressed the opinion that Dewey's "choice of this occasion was unfortunate and bad."

　　纽约市招待联大代表宴会上
    杜威粗野毁谤苏联  苏联代表毅然离席
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日讯：纽约市政府今日在华道夫·亚斯托利亚饭店设宴欢迎参加联合国大会的各国代表。在席上，作为本届联大会址所在国代表的纽约州长杜威，表演了空前未有的粗野行为。大家原来以为杜威既然是纽约州州长，就理应对来访的各代表团表示热诚的欢迎，但是这种起码的礼貌对于杜威说来，显然是陌生的东西。杜威在致“欢迎词”时，一开始就对苏联作恶毒的毁谤，当杜威说出第一句侮蔑性的话时，维辛斯基、马立克和苏联代表团的其他团员们即离座走出了华道夫·亚斯托利亚饭店。杜威这种粗野的行为甚至引起了菲律宾代表罗慕洛的愤慨，当他继杜威之后起立发言时，不得不间接地斥责杜威。参加宴会的其他代表也都对杜威的行径表示不赞成。纽约时报称：若干赴宴的贵宾私下表示意见说：杜威“选择这个场合是不幸的而且恶劣的”。
