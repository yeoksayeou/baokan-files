Model Forester Wang Fengming

　　Lüshan Mountain is the only large mountain in Liaoxi Province, and more than a dozen rivers in the province originate here. However, the mountain is barren and treeless. In summer, when it rains heavily, floods carrying sand and rocks rush down, raising the riverbed and frequently causing severe floods. Wang Fengming lives in Shitou Miaozi Village (Sixth District, Yixian County) at the foot of this mountain. Over the past ten years, he has planted more than twenty *qing* of black pine trees on this bare mountain, gradually turning the barren hills green.

　　Wang Fengming was originally from Rehe Province, and his family was very poor. From a young age, he grazed cattle and sheep at home, and at the age of fifteen, he worked as a hired hand for others. At the age of twenty-seven, he went to Lüshan Temple in Beizhen County to work as a hired hand, where he learned the techniques of cultivating seedlings and planting trees from the Taoist priests of the temple. In the year Wang Fengming turned thirty, he brought five thousand black pine seedlings and seven *dou* of black pine seeds from Rehe to Nangou, Shitou Miaozi Village. He then rented temple land and began cultivating seedlings and planting trees. After seven or eight years, he bought a barren mountain himself and planted trees while also farming.

　　This spring, Wang Fengming single-handedly planted three *qing* and five *mu* of black pine, more than 20,000 trees. In order to reward seedling cultivation and afforestation, the People's Government supported his nursery and provided a loan of 20 million yuan (Northeast currency) to help him solve his difficulties. Therefore, Wang Fengming's nursery has been expanded to more than one *mu*, capable of producing 120,000 black pine seedlings and about 40,000 tree seedlings such as *youdi* and locust trees. These small seedlings are now growing very well.

　　Wang Fengming not only plants trees himself but also frequently promotes the benefits of planting trees to the masses. Last year, he led ten households to plant more than 50,000 black pine trees. This February, at the County People's Representative Conference, he voluntarily proposed a plan to "guarantee not to cut down a single tree and to plant and keep alive ten trees per person," and also challenged other villages. In this afforestation competition, Shitou Miaozi planted more than four *qing* of black pine and more than 10,000 trees for riverbank protection (north bank of the Xihe River). Under his influence, other villages also enthusiastically engaged in afforestation, with Goukouzi Village alone planting more than ten *qing* of riverbank protection forests.

　　During this year's rainy season afforestation, Wang Fengming organized an afforestation cooperative in the village (twelve households, sixteen laborers), and contracted with the government to plant six *qing* of black pine (26,000 trees), with a survival rate of over 80 percent. He also plans to mobilize the entire village to join the afforestation cooperative. Seeing that he has greatly benefited from planting trees, the masses have also come to him to discuss, ask for guidance, and establish cooperative nurseries, preparing to cultivate a large number of seedlings and plant trees next year.

　　The result of Wang Fengming's fifteen years of fighting against nature has transformed the barren hills of Nangou and Beigou; his life has also improved accordingly. When he first arrived in Yixian, he was penniless, but now he has five houses, four *qing* of cultivated land, four *qing* of forest land, two head of draft animals, a cart, and thirty sheep. Because he has made remarkable achievements in seedling cultivation and tree planting, he was elected as a county-level afforestation model this January, and this time he was elected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

　　造林模范王凤鸣
    闾山，是辽西省的唯一大山，全省有十几条河流从这里发源。但山是荒芜的，没有树。夏天，下大雨的时候，洪水卷着砂石冲刷下来，河身加高，经常泛滥成严重的水灾。王凤鸣就住在这山东麓的石头庙子村（义县六区）。十几年来，他在这光秃秃的山上栽了二十多垧黑松树，多年的荒山，渐渐的青绿起来了。
    王凤鸣，原来是热河省人，家境非常困难。从小他就在家放牧牛羊，十五岁给人家抗大活。二十七岁到北镇县闾山大庙抗活，跟该庙的道士学会了养苗栽树的技术。王凤鸣三十岁的那年，从热河带了五千棵黑松苗和七斗黑松子，来到石头庙子村南沟。这时，他就租了庙地，开始了育苗植树了。过了七八年，他又自己买了一块荒山，一面造林、一面种地。
    今年春季，王凤鸣一个人已栽了三垧五亩地的黑松，有两万多棵。人民政府为了奖励育苗造林，支持了他的苗圃，并贷款两千万元（东北币）帮助他解决困难。因此王凤鸣的苗圃已扩充到一亩多地，能生产黑松苗十二万株，鼬荻、洋槐等树苗四万株左右。这些小苗现在长的很好。
    王凤鸣不光自己栽树，还经常向群众宣传栽树的好处。去年他即带起十户栽了五万多棵黑松。今年二月，县人民代表会议上，他又自动提出：“保证不砍一棵树，每人栽活十棵树”的计划；还向别的村挑战。在这次造林比赛中，石头庙子栽了四垧多地的黑松，和一万多棵护岸林（细河北岸）。在他的影响下，别的村也热烈展开造林，只沟口子村就栽了护岸林十垧多。
    今年雨季造林的时候，王凤鸣在村里组织了造林合作社（十二户、十六个劳动力），和政府订合同栽了六垧地的黑松（两万六千棵），成活率在百分之八十以上。他并计划发动全村群众普遍加入造林合作社。群众见到他栽树得到很大利益，也都纷纷找他商量，请他指导，成立合作苗圃，准备明年大量育苗栽树。
    王凤鸣十五年来和自然斗争的结果，使南、北沟的荒山变了样；他的生活也随着改善了。他初到义县时，一贫如洗，现在已有五间房子、四垧熟地，四垧林地、两头耕畜、一辆车、三十只羊。因为他育苗栽树有了显著成绩，今年一月，当选了县里造林模范，这次又当选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。
