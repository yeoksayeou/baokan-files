　　Nehru Delivers Foreign Policy Speech
    Advocates for PRC Representation in the UN
    Criticizes UN Ignoring China's Current Reality
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd dispatch] According to the Indian News Service: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered two speeches on foreign policy on the 19th and 21st. On the 19th, in a speech on foreign policy at the Indian National Congress Party's Proposal Committee meeting held in the Nasik district of Bombay, Nehru advocated for the participation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations organization. He said that the issue of the People's Republic of China's participation in the United Nations "is a vital issue concerning the future of the United Nations." "From all perspectives, our great neighbor, China, should have appropriate representation in the United Nations." Referring to the representatives of the "Kuomintang government" "sitting in the United Nations," he pointed out, "It is factually incorrect to call these people representatives of China. If people's claims are based on falsehoods and they do some wrong things, then the things they do later may also be wrong." On the 21st, after the Indian representative's proposal on the People's Republic of China's participation in the United Nations was rejected by the UN General Assembly, Nehru said at the opening meeting of the National Congress Party Congress in Gandhinagar that despite the UN decision to reject India's proposal, this decision did not change the current situation. The Chinese People's Government continues to exercise its functions, and the existence of the Chinese state is also a reality. He said, "Although the United Nations resolution rejected India's proposal, it did not take into account the current reality of China. If the United Nations is still dreaming of the old China, which is now almost dead, then it is closing its eyes to the facts. The new Chinese government did not gain power by chance but through thirty years of long war." He said, "Today, when even the shadow of the old Kuomintang no longer exists in China, if it is still believed that the Kuomintang representatives should continue to remain in the United Nations, this is to disregard the facts. This kind of resolution cannot be said to represent the real situation, therefore it loses its due importance."

　　尼赫鲁发表外交政策演说
    主张联合国应有我代表参加
    斥联合国不顾中国目前真实情况
    【新华社二十二日讯】据印度新闻处讯：印度总理尼赫鲁在十九日和二十一日两次发表了关于外交政策的演说。十九日，尼赫鲁在孟买纳西克区所举行的印度国民大会党提案委员会会议上所作的关于外交政策的演说中主张联合国组织中应有中华人民共和国代表参加。他说：中华人民共和国代表参加联合国的问题“是联合国的前途所系的生命攸关的问题”。“从各种观点看来，我们的伟大的邻邦——中国在联合国中都应当有适当的代表”。他在提到“坐在联合国内的”“国民党政府”代表时指出：“把这种人称为中国代表，在事实上是错误的。如果人们的主张以错误为根据，并且做了一些错误的事，那末他们以后做的事也可能会跟着错下去”。二十一日，当印度代表在联合国大会上提出的关于中华人民共和国代表参加联合国的提案被否决后，尼赫鲁在甘德新那加国大党全国代表大会开幕会议上演说时说：尽管联大决定拒绝了印度的建议，可是此项决定并未改变目前的形势。中国人民政府继续行使其职权，中国国家的存在也是一个现实。他说：“联合国决议案虽然拒绝了印度的建议，但没有顾到目前中国的真实情况。如果联合国仍在梦想着现在差不多已经死亡了的旧中国，那它就是闭起眼睛不看事实。新的中国政府不是由于偶然机会而获得政权，而是经过三十年的长期战争。”他说：“在今天旧国民党人在中国甚至连影子都不存在的情况下，如果仍以为国民党代表应继续留在联合国内这就是不顾事实。这种决议案决不能说是代表真实情况，因此它也就失去其应有的重要性。”
