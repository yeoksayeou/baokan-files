Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 1st. Yang Decheng, a fisherman who was wounded by US aircraft strafing on August 29th, gave a detailed account of the ordeal to our agency's reporter. Yang Decheng was one of the fishermen wounded by US aircraft strafing on the Yalu River waters of Gulouzi Village, Kuandian County, on August 29th. The middle and ring fingers of his right hand were broken, three of his companions were killed, and four others were injured. They had all recently been working as boatmen on civilian boats. The course of events was as follows: The four sailboats led by Yang Decheng were carrying corn from Lagushao port in Kuandian County to Andong City. At 5:00 PM on the 29th, while sailing through the river surface of Gulouzi Village, one ran aground. The nine fishermen on the other three boats rushed to help push it into the water. At that moment—5:50 PM, four US Air Force P-51 fighter planes suddenly flew in from the east. After circling over Gulouzi Village once, they flew low to the river surface. The first three planes quickly swept over the bows of the sailboats, and the last plane dived sharply to low altitude, strafing our fishermen. Liu Fuzhou, a young fisherman standing at the bow of the boat, was shot through the lungs and immediately fell into the water. Fishermen Wu Xichun and Huang Jingui were also killed at that time. Yang Decheng and four other companions were wounded by the planes.

　　被美机扫射受伤渔夫
    向记者详谈遇难经过
    【新华社安东一日电】八月二十九日被美国飞机扫射受伤的渔夫杨德诚向本社记者详谈遇难的经过。杨德诚是八月二十九日在我国宽甸县属古楼子村鸭绿江水面被美国飞机扫射受伤的渔夫之一。他的右手的中指和无名指都被打断了，他的同伴有三人被打死，另外有四人被打伤。他们都是最近在民船上充当船工的。事件的经过是这样的：杨德诚所带领的四艘帆船，载着包谷从我国宽甸县属拉古哨口岸运来安东市，于二十九日下午五时航经古楼子村江面时，有一艘搁浅了，其他三艘船上的九个渔夫都赶来帮助往水里推。正在这时——下午五点五十分钟，美国空军Ｐ五十一式战斗机四架，突然自东飞来，在古楼子村上空盘旋一周后，低飞至江面，前三架从帆船头上迅速掠过，最后一架急降到低空，向我渔夫扫射，站在船头撑船的青年渔夫刘福洲，肺部被子弹贯穿，当即倒入水中，渔夫吴锡纯和黄金贵两人也在当时被打死。杨德诚和另四位伙伴则被飞机打伤。
