Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 3rd: More than a thousand representatives from all walks of life in Lüda gathered at the Cultural Palace Theater today to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the "September 3rd" Victory Day. Guo Shushen, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Lüda District Committee, and Major General Lazkezov, representative of the Soviet Army Command, delivered speeches at the meeting. Guo Shushen said in an impassioned tone: "Just as we are welcoming the fifth anniversary of 'September 3rd,' American imperialist planes have invaded our country's airspace, killing and wounding our peaceful residents. Five years ago, we defeated the Japanese imperialists who invaded China. If the American imperialists dare to invade our country today, we will certainly defeat them too." After recounting the achievements of Lüda's construction in the five years since the liberation by the Soviet army, Guo Shushen said: "The people of Lüda have learned from more than 40 years of rule by Japanese imperialism that imperialism brings people only the terror of hunger and death. Now our lives have greatly improved, and we no longer want to return to the painful abyss of the past. If anyone wants to make us suffer again, we will eliminate them."
On the same day, 39 units, including various Lüda agencies, organizations, factories, and enterprises, laid wreaths at the Soviet Army Memorial Tower in Stalin Square to thank the Soviet army for defeating the Japanese aggressors and liberating Northeast China.

　　旅大人民纪念“九三”
    “五年前我们打败了日本帝国主义美帝敢来侵略我们也一定打败它”
    【新华社大连三日电】旅大各界人民代表千余人，今日于文化宫剧场集会庆祝“九三”胜利节五周年。中共旅大区党委副书记郭述申及苏军司令部代表拉兹克佐夫少将等均在会上发表了演说。郭述申以激奋的口吻说：“正在我们迎接‘九三’五周年纪念时，美帝国主义的飞机侵入我国领空，杀伤我国和平居民。五年前我们打败了侵略中国的日本帝国主义，如果今天美帝胆敢侵略我国，我们也一定打败他。”郭述申在追述旅大在苏军解放五年来的各项建设成就后说：“旅大人民从日本帝国主义四十多年来的统治中得到证明：帝国主义带给人民的只有饥饿之恐怖和死亡。如今我们的生活已大为改善，再不愿回到过去痛苦的深渊。如果有人再想让我们过苦日子，我们就消灭他。”
    同日，旅大各机关、团体和工厂企业等三十九个单位，均向斯大林广场的苏军纪念塔献花，感谢苏军打败日侵略军和解放东北。
