Xinhua News Agency, September 5th:

Since our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai, on August 27th and 30th, successively lodged serious protests with the US government and filed accusations with the Security Council regarding the provocative acts of military aircraft of the US invading forces in Korea violating our Northeast airspace and killing and injuring our people, the reactions from various relevant parties of the US government have been extremely chaotic. US government officials, regarding this crime, initially attempted to deny it, then hesitantly confessed. This fact fully exposes the base and despicable face of the US aggressors who use lies to deceive the world, and also exposes that this crime of the US aggressors was an intentional provocation.

As early as the day after our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued his first accusation regarding the US aircraft violating our territory on August 27th (August 28th), the US Far East Air Force (that is, the aerial bandits who bomb and shoot peaceful Korean residents every day and who shot and killed peaceful Chinese residents in two provocative incidents) headquarters immediately denied this bloody act of aggression completely. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo on August 28th, a US Far East Air Force spokesman said: "No aircraft flew over Manchuria." According to this spokesman, flight personnel had received detailed orders not to cross the border, and they "had good maps, and they knew where they were." This shameless denial by the US Far East Air Force was immediately cited by US State Department press officer McDermott at a press conference that day in an attempt to shirk US responsibility.

The US Chief Representative to the Security Council, Austin, also wrote to UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on August 29th, similarly attempting to deny the incident by claiming that the US Air Force had been ordered not to cross the border.

After our Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai issued a second accusation regarding the US aircraft violating our territory on August 30th, according to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on August 31st, the US Far East Air Force spokesman still shamelessly declared: "We have carefully ordered all our pilots and other flight personnel to cautiously avoid border incidents, and we have reminded them not to cross the North Korean border anywhere." However, on the same day, the US authorities in Washington seemed to have realized that the evidence was overwhelming and denial was impossible. Therefore, the US representative to the Security Council, Austin, declared in the Security Council, after the Soviet representative Malik, the President of the Security Council, announced that he would include my accusation of US aircraft provocation on the agenda: "Many reports have now been received stating that one P-51 aircraft from the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron may have mistakenly flown into Chinese Manchurian airspace on the evening of August 27, 1950, strafed, and bombed a runway. This evidence has not been fully confirmed and only suggests the possibility that one P-51 aircraft may have attacked the Antung Airport in Manchuria, approximately five miles from the Korean border.” (US Information Service, Lake Success, September 1st)

After Austin made this incomplete confession, a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on September 4th followed up by reporting that it had learned from "reliable sources" that a P-51 aircraft had flown over Antung and strafed the airport there. However, the US Far East Air Force Headquarters still "remained silent" on this matter, and the pilot's name was not announced.

Although Austin used many words like "may" and "not fully confirmed" in a vain attempt to mitigate the serious criminal behavior of the US aggressors, and tried to portray the total of seventeen US bombers and fighters that continuously violated our airspace as "one - P-51 aircraft," this is already sufficient to prove that all the previous denials spread by the US Far East Air Force Headquarters, the US State Department, and Austin himself were the most shameless lies. At the same time, people can clearly see from these lies that the US Air Force personnel who violated Chinese airspace were all "under detailed orders and had good maps, knowing where they were." Therefore, people can also clearly understand that the reason why they dared to fly in groups across the Yalu River, intrude into our airspace, strafe our stations, civilian ships, and airports, and kill and injure 35 of our people was by no means due to some "accidental misunderstanding," but a deliberate provocation carried out on orders. From the lies manufactured by the US aggressors to cover up their crimes, and then exposed by themselves, the Chinese people and the people of the world have once again recognized the bandit-like face of the aggressors.

### 美国官员吞吞吐吐供出实情  证明美机系有意挑衅　美侵略者卑劣面目充分暴露

　　美国官员吞吞吐吐供出实情
    证明美机系有意挑衅
    美侵略者卑劣面目充分暴露
    【新华社五日讯】自我国周外长于八月二十七日与三十日先后就美国侵略朝鲜军队军用飞机侵犯我国东北上空和杀伤我国人民的挑衅行为，向美国政府提出严重抗议，并向安理会提出控诉以后，美国政府各有关方面的反应极为混乱。美国政府官员对于这一罪行，始而狡赖，继而吞吞吐吐地招供。这个事实，充分暴露了美国侵略者以谎言欺骗世界的卑劣面目，也暴露了美国侵略者的这种罪行乃是有意的挑衅。
    早在八月二十七日我周外长就第一次美机犯境事件发出控诉的第二日（八月二十八日），美国远东空军（即天天在轰炸并射杀朝鲜和平居民而且在两次挑衅事件中射杀中国和平居民的空中强盗）司令部曾马上把这一血腥的侵略行为赖得干干净净。据美联社东京八月二十八日电，美远东空军发言人曾说：“没有飞机飞越到满洲上空”。据这位发言人说：飞行人员均曾奉到详细的命令，不得越过国境，而且他们“备有良好的地图，他们知道他们到了那里”。美国远东空军这种无耻狡赖，又曾立即为美国国务院新闻发布官麦克德谟当日在记者招待会上引用，企图推卸美国的罪责。
    美国驻安理会首席代表奥斯汀亦于八月二十九日致函联合国秘书长赖伊，同样以美国空军曾受命不得越境为辞企图狡赖。
    至八月三十日我周外长就美机再次犯境事件再度发出控诉以后，据合众社东京八月三十一日电，美国远东空军发言人仍然厚颜无耻地宣称：“我们曾经小心地命令过我们所有的驾驶员以及其他飞行人员谨慎地避免边界事件，我们曾提醒他们注意不要在任何地方越过北朝鲜国界。”但是，就在同一天，华盛顿方面的美国当局似乎已经感觉到铁证如山，赖不过了，于是，美国驻安理会的代表奥斯汀就在安理会上，在安理会主席苏联代表马立克宣布把我控诉美机挑衅问题列入议程以后宣称：“现已获得许多报告，说明六十七战斗轰炸机中队，可能有一架Ｐ——五十一式飞机于一九五○年八月二十七日傍晚误飞至中国满洲领空扫射，并轰炸了一条跑道。这一证据尚未完全证实，仅仅是说明有这种可能性，即可能有一架Ｐ——五十一式的飞机曾经攻击了距朝鲜边境约五英里的满洲安东机场。”（美国新闻处成功湖九月一日电）
    在奥斯汀作了这种不完全的供认以后，合众社东京九月四日电跟着报道说：自“可靠方面”获悉：有一架Ｐ——五十一式飞机曾飞临安东上空，并扫射了那里的飞机场。然而美国远东空军司令部却还是对此“保持缄默”，飞行员的名字也不予宣布。
    虽然奥斯汀还用了不少“可能”与“未完全证实”的字句，妄想减轻美国侵略者的严重的犯罪行为，并想把连续侵犯我国领空的前后共十七架美国轰炸机和战斗机说成“一架——Ｐ五十一式飞机”，但是，这却已经足够证明：所有美国远东空军司令部、美国国务院与奥斯汀本人前此所散布的一切否认，乃是最无耻的谎言。同时，人们从这些谎言中还可以清楚地看到：那些侵犯中国领空的美国空军都是“奉有详细命令，而且备有良好地图，知道到了那里”的。因此，人们也可以明白知道，他们之所以居然成群结队接一连二地飞过鸭绿江江面，侵入我国领空，扫射我国车站、民船和机场，毙伤我国人民达三十五人，就决不是出于什么“偶然的误会”，而是奉命进行的有意的挑衅。从美国侵略者为了掩饰其罪行而制造出来的，最后又为自己所拆穿的谎言中，中国人民和全世界人民又一次认识了侵略者的强盗面目。
