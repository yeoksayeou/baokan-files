　　An-tung Paper Mill Combines Rectification with Self-examination
    Neglecting to Unite Technical Personnel Affects Production
    Failure to Recognize Technical Personnel as a Component of the Working Class Is the Main Reason for the Mistakes.
    [This newspaper's An-tung dispatch] The state-owned An-tung Paper Mill examined its work on uniting technical personnel during the rectification movement. It was discovered that in the past, the leadership did not regard technical personnel as part of the working class, did not clearly define the responsibilities of technical personnel, and did not provide enough political assistance to technical personnel, resulting in many technical personnel being unwilling to work and failing to play their due role in production.
    An-tung Paper Mill currently has 91 technical personnel, of whom 38 are technical personnel and young students recruited from within China last year (the rest are original old technical workers who have been promoted to technicians). In the past, they lacked a realistic understanding of the industrial base and living environment in Northeast China. At the same time, some had personal plans. After arriving in Northeast China, because the leadership did not pay timely attention to strengthening the work of uniting technical personnel, some technical personnel were dissatisfied with party and government cadres, could not get along with workers, and even had disunity among technical personnel. During the rectification and examination, all the factory's employees raised many opinions on the issue of uniting technical personnel, and the leadership also made a preliminary self-criticism:
    First, the basic mistake was not regarding technical personnel as a component of the working class. Therefore, they were either "respected and kept at a distance" or treated with "unprincipled amiability," relaxing the cultivation and education of technical personnel. For example, when some technical personnel were first discovered to have phenomena such as belittling workers' inventions, not helping workers learn technology, and "unwillingness to be second to others" among technical personnel, the leadership did not grasp the ideological education and pay attention to it, but adopted an attitude of "respecting and keeping at a distance," ignoring it. After the higher authorities repeatedly instructed to strengthen the work of uniting technical personnel, the factory leadership mistakenly adopted an attitude of "unprincipled accommodation" and "unprincipled amiability," allowing them to go wherever they wanted when assigning work, and if they didn't want to go, that was fine; there were also phenomena of not complying with rules and regulations at work, and workers were dissatisfied with technical personnel, affecting production.
    Second, in the use of technical personnel, due to unclear responsibilities, technical personnel could not get involved when they arrived at the workshop and could not play their active role. There were three types of performance of technical personnel in the factory: The first type was that they could participate in practical work with the workers, were willing to ask workers if they didn't understand, and could assume the responsibility of technical instructors. These technical personnel were welcomed by the workers; the second type was that they could not get involved when they arrived at the workshop, had no practical work to do, and only helped the workshop fill out forms and write logs, failing to play the role of technical personnel; the third type was that they neither participated in practical work nor helped with filling out forms, and even when workers studied technical problems, they did not participate when invited. The emergence of these phenomena is the inevitable result of the lack of clear responsibilities and systems for the work of technical personnel.
    In response to the above self-examination, the factory leadership first clarified that technical personnel are a component of the working class and recognized that technical personnel have an indispensable role in production. Therefore, technical personnel should not only be used correctly, but also be responsible for their cultivation and education. The factory has now decided that young students who only have theoretical knowledge but lack practical experience should be mobilized to go to the workshop to give them specific operational work and sign mutual learning contracts with workers (now being drafted, the contract stipulates that within a certain period, technical personnel will teach workers those technical theories, and workers will teach technical personnel those practical operation methods); qualified technical personnel with practical operation experience will be assigned appropriate administrative leadership work, and the job responsibility regulations for technical personnel have been formulated so that technical personnel have something to follow in order to give play to their initiative and enthusiasm. At the same time, it calls for criticism and self-criticism, helping technical personnel improve their political understanding politically, so that they can become the people's technical personnel.

　　安东造纸厂结合整风进行检查
    忽视团结技术人员影响生产
    不认识技术人员是工人阶级的组成部分，是发生错误的主要原因。
    【本报安东讯】国营安东造纸厂在整风当中检查了团结技术人员工作。发现领导上过去没有将技术人员看成是工人阶级的一部分，给予技术人员的工作职责不明确，对技术人员从政治上帮助不够，致许多技术人员不安心工作，在生产中没有发挥应有的作用。
    安东造纸厂现有技术人员九一名，其中去年由关内招聘来的技术人员与青年学生就有三八名（其余者是原来的老技术工人，提拔为技术员）。过去他们对东北地区的工业基地及生活环境缺乏现实的了解，同时有些人存在个人打算，到东北后，因为领导上没有及时注意加强团结技术人员的工作，有些技术人员对党、政干部不满，和工人搞不到一起，甚至技术人员之间也有不团结现象。在整风检查中，全厂职工对团结技术人员问题提了很多意见，领导也作了初步检讨：
    第一、基本错误是没把技术人员看成工人阶级的组成部分。因此对技术人员不是“敬而远之”，就是“一团和气”，放松了对技术人员的培养与教育。如初来时，领导上已经发现有些技术人员存有轻视工人创造发明，不帮助工人学习技术及技术人员间的“不甘居人之下”的现象，领导上并未抓紧进行思想教育和提起注意，而是采取“敬而远之”不闻不问的态度。上级一再指示加强团结技术人员工作之后，该厂领导却又错误的采取了“无原则的迁就”和“一团和气”的态度，分配工作时愿去就去，不去也就算了；在工作岗位上也发生不遵守制度和纪律的现象，工人对技术人员存在不满情绪，影响生产。
    第二、对技术人员的使用上，由于职责不明，使技术人员到了车间也插不上手，不能发挥其积极作用。该厂到车间的技术人员有三种表现：第一种，到车间能和工人在一起参加实际工作，不明白的肯问工人，并能负起技术教员的责任，这些技术人员工人很欢迎；第二种，到了车间插不上手，没有实际工作干，就帮助车间填填表，写写日志，没起技术人员作用；第三种是既不参加实际工作，连填表工作也不帮助，甚至工人研究技术问题，邀请他也不参加。这些现象的产生，正是由于技术人员工作没有明确职责和制度的必然结果。
    针对上述检讨，该厂领导首先明确了技术人员是工人阶级的组成部分，认识到技术人员在生产中有不可忽视的作用，因此对于技术人员不仅要正确使用，且应负起培养与教育之责。该厂现已决定对一般只有理论而缺乏实际经验的青年学生，应动员到车间去给以具体的操作工作，与工人订立互相学习的合同（现已开始在订，合同规定在一定期限内技术人员教给工人那些技术理论，工人教会技术人员那些实际操作法）；对有实际操作经验的称职技术人员，分配给适当的行政领导工作，并拟定了技术人员的工作职责条例，使技术人员有所遵循，以发挥其主动积极性。同时号召批评与自我批评，从政治上帮助技术人员提高政治认识，使其成为人民的技术人员。
