　　Zhang Zhiquan Leads Dazhai Village from Poverty to Prosperity
　　Last year, with the male labor force reduced by 28% compared to before the War of Resistance, the average yield per mu of land exceeded 10% compared to before the War of Resistance.
　　In Dazhai Village, on the bank of the Zhuozhang River in Yushe County, Shanxi Province, the crops grow particularly strong, and the fruits are large and plump. If you go into the village and ask, the farmers will tell you: because their mutual aid groups are doing well and they attach importance to the improvement of production technology, last year, with the male labor force reduced by 28% compared to before the War of Resistance, the average yield per mu of land exceeded 10% compared to before the War of Resistance. This village has been selected as a model production village in the county. The person leading the production of this village is Zhang Zhiquan.
　　Zhang Zhiquan is a Communist Party member, elected as a labor hero in 1944, and participated in the Second Taihang District Labor Model Conference in 1946, where he was elected as a First-Class Labor Hero of the Taihang District. This time, he was again elected as a representative to the National Congress of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Labor Models.

  The Birth of Mutual Aid Groups
　　In the autumn of 1944, the Japanese invaders swept through the Taihang Liberated Area. The Japanese devils were stationed in Zhaiguan and Taoyang, fifteen miles away from Dazhai Village. At this time, the masses had to support the war and immediately harvest the crops ripe in the fields. In an extremely urgent situation, Zhang Zhiquan mobilized 20 people and organized two mutual aid groups, himself serving as the work assignment team leader, leading the labor exchange between the front and rear. After half a month of rushing to harvest, the autumn harvest was completed. The following year, Zhang Zhiquan led the mutual aid group to continue. Based on the opinions of the masses, he created a work point board. Work points were assigned based on labor, and work tickets were used, solving the difficulty of accounting. This year, the mutual aid group had expanded to 30 households.
　　In the spring of 1946, Zhang Zhiquan brought back from the county farm a dou of Golden Queen corn and two dou of One-Six-Nine wheat, both improved varieties, and mobilized everyone to plant them. Because of lack of experience, the improved varieties did not grow well that year. But he was not discouraged. At the Labor Model Conference, he specifically visited the labor hero Li Shunda for this purpose. This year, their mutual aid group's work point recording method was changed to a system of grading and adjusting based on the work done. When assigning work, attention was also paid to the quality of skills and the strength of labor. The mutual aid group was further developed and consolidated. Of the 46 households in the village, 39 had joined the mutual aid group, accounting for 85% of the total number of households; the labor force organized accounted for 90% of the village's labor force.
　　In the spring of 1947, Zhang Zhiquan's mutual aid group began to pay attention to improving production technology. When sowing, he mobilized the masses to soak the seeds. Some people found it troublesome, and others were afraid that the seeds would die. He himself first soaked three mu of millet seeds and two mu of corn seeds in warm water. The seeds not only did not die, but the crops also grew particularly strong. In the autumn, the People's Government called for autumn plowing. The masses believed that plowing the millet stubble would prevent the growth of bean pods the following year. Zhang Zhiquan took the lead in responding to the call and plowed five mu. The following year (1948), when sowing in the spring, in addition to seven mu of beans, eight mu of yams, melons, and vegetables, Zhang Zhiquan soaked all the remaining crops. Under his leadership, Zhang Zaiyuan and Zhang Genquan also began to soak seeds. The land he plowed in the autumn was planted with beans this year, and not only did the seedlings emerge on time, but they were also strong and uniform. Some people said: "Don't look at the strong seedlings, look at the pods." In the autumn, the bean pods were full on the stalks. Zhang Zhiquan used the facts to widely publicize the benefits of stubble plowing and organized the masses to visit the fields. The facts shattered the conservative thinking of the masses. After the crops were harvested, Zhang Zhiquan's land was all plowed, and some of the masses also began autumn plowing. During the autumn harvest, he also organized the masses to visit his own planted 811 millet and Golden Queen corn. The masses praised the crops repeatedly, vying to keep the seeds. After the harvest, one and a half mu of 811 millet yielded five shi (each shi is over 160 jin), and half a mu of Golden Queen yielded one shi and five dou. This laid the foundation for the promotion of improved varieties.
　　In that year (1948), the Liberation War was fought fiercely, and large numbers of farmers in the Liberated Areas poured to the front lines to participate in war service. During the Jinzhong Campaign, 20 of the 28 full laborers in Dazhai Village participated in the war; five of the seven donkeys were used for the war effort. Under extremely difficult conditions, Zhang Zhiquan mobilized 25 women to participate in labor exchange and mutual assistance, overcoming the shortage of labor and animal power, and ensuring that support for the front and production were not neglected.

  Attaching Importance to Improving Technology
　　Due to the organization overcoming various difficulties, from 1947 to 1948, the land yield of Dazhai Village had approached the pre-war level. The mutual aid group further proposed: "Improve technology, change the wartime practice of prioritizing speed over quality, and further increase production." Thus, 1949 was the year when agricultural technology developed the fastest in Dazhai. In the spring, Zhang Zhiquan, based on the demands of the masses, mobilized 12 experienced old farmers to form a technology research association, advocating for the improvement of technology. First, when cultivating the land, they selected experienced old farmers with good cultivation skills to hold the plow, ensuring deep plowing and fine harrowing. When sowing, he continued to mobilize the masses to soak the seeds. The Changfu group still did not soak, and as a result, the seedlings of Zhang Zhiquan's group grew uniformly, while the 25 mu of millet in the Changfu group had to be planted three times before the seedlings took root. After the autumn, a mass meeting was held to summarize the soaking and mixing of seeds. At the meeting, the masses generally recognized that Zhang Zhiquan's group had been soaking seeds for three consecutive years, and none of the crops had been diseased. Everyone understood the effectiveness of soaking seeds. When planting wheat, only three mu of the village's 122 mu of wheat fields were not soaked. At the same time, Zhang Zhiquan also led the village to further research weeding techniques, proposing "Lie a cow down in the cornfield (referring to leaving a triangle), lie a dog down in the sorghum field, and broadcast small beans on the hillside." Before weeding, he put forward the slogan "Weed millet by the inch, manure on top." But some of the masses said: "Weeding millet by the inch will cause 'navel wind', and it cannot be dug until forty days." At that time, he did not argue. When the millet grew to one inch high, he led his group to weed it all. The millet not only did not suffer from "navel wind" after weeding, but the seedlings grew thick and large. Zhang Xiaosan weeded his millet late, and the seedlings were small and yellow. The technology research association also led everyone to improve weeding techniques, implementing "The first weeding is shallow and precise, the second weeding is deep and even, and the third weeding piles up roundly." Due to the improvement of production technology, the average yield of Dazhai Village in 1949 exceeded the pre-war level.
　　This year, Dazhai Village paid even more attention to agricultural technology improvement. When sowing, 49 households in the village adopted various improved varieties. In order to further research varieties, Zhang Zhiquan specifically set aside one mu and two fen of good land to trial-plant 16 varieties of millet, and eight fen of land to trial-plant 12 varieties of miscellaneous grains. In addition, he also organized four special contract households to trial-plant more than 10 varieties of improved varieties. The seeds used for trial planting were all soaked and mixed with fertilizer according to the soil conditions. The masses who visited his trial planting results all said: "It's just like the county farm." Later, everyone called it "the small farm." This year, all 370 mu of millet planted in the village were soaked, and more than 90% of the corn and sorghum were also soaked. In addition, the technology research association, based on the fact that Zhang Huaiyuan's clay soil was padded with sand last year, and Zhang Bucheng's padding with white soil resulted in more grain, promoted the improvement of 156 mu of soil throughout the village, and it is estimated that the annual output can be increased by 31 shi (calculated at two dou per mu).
　　In improving agricultural technology, Dazhai Village also paid attention to improving agricultural implements. They created a single-person sowing plow (with a funnel on the plow and a seed delivery tube drilled in the plow handle, one person can sow while plowing, suitable for planting beans), saving one person in the sowing work (generally, two people are needed for sowing). In dry weather, the seeds can also reach the moist soil at the bottom of the plow through the seed delivery tube (suitable for seeds that need to be sown deep). This year, 16 households have used this plow for sowing.
　　Zhang Zhiquan's mutual aid group is well-led. His main experiences are: (1) Close integration of organization and technology improvement. The Dazhai mutual aid group grew up during the war and gradually increased production. The key lies in recognizing the importance of technology improvement and closely integrating technology improvement with the consolidation and development of the mutual aid group on the basis of mass awareness. (2) Fully promoting democracy and truly achieving equivalent exchange. Zhang Zhiquan's mutual aid group has grown from small to large, from temporary to regular, and has gradually achieved reasonable equivalence through methods such as recording work and converting work, to implementing "work tickets", "on-site work evaluation", and "work evaluation based on the work done". Work assignments are also democratically discussed and evaluated according to the urgency of the season and terrain. In this way, it not only overcomes the selfish thinking of some members who only care about themselves and not others, but also gradually leads the mutual aid group to expansion and consolidation. (3) Combining scientific technology with practical experience. The improvement of agricultural technology is first experimented with and then promoted, using the already successful facts to drive the masses. Each time Dazhai Village improves its technology, it encounters resistance from the masses, but when Zhang Zhiquan encounters this situation, he first conducts experiments himself, makes a model, and then breaks the conservative thinking of the masses and promotes it throughout the village through field visits and examples.

  Moving Towards Prosperity
　　Because production is doing well, Dazhai Village has changed from poor to prosperous. Before the war, the village had 35 households, 174 people, and 876.5 mu of land. But of this land, landlords in the city occupied 600 mu, two rich peasant households occupied more than 90 mu, and 33 middle and poor peasant households had only a little over 180 mu of thin land. The peasants paid rent and grain every year, and the vast majority lacked food and clothing. After the War of Resistance, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, Zhang Zhiquan led everyone to implement rent and interest reduction, land reform, labor mutual assistance, and technology improvement, and their land yield has greatly increased. The village's average annual grain output before the war was 964 shi (including rent), which had recovered to 954 shi in 1947. Due to a poor harvest in 1948, it dropped to 739 shi, but in 1949, during the large-scale increase production campaign, the output had increased to 1,158 shi, an average of one dou and one sheng per mu, exceeding the pre-war level. Production is even better this year than last year, and output will increase even more. Due to the development of production, the lives of the masses have significantly improved. The phenomenon of eating chaff and vegetables for half the year is no longer seen. Of the 53 households in the village, except for three households that lack three months of food due to poor management, the vast majority have enough grain for a year, 24 households have surplus grain of 330 shi, and five households have enough grain to eat for three years. The development of livestock has reached the pre-war level. The village already has 25 head of livestock, 125 sheep, and 29 pigs (before the war, only two rich peasant households in the village had two pigs). This spring, they bought two new mules, two carts, built 15 new houses, installed two mills, and 12 households bought wood to build more than 30 houses.
　　Due to the rise in the economic life of the peasants in Dazhai Village, cultural life has also begun to develop. A primary school was established in 1947 (there were no schools before the war, and only the children of seven rich households were literate). In the past three years, 10 young people have participated in youth literacy classes and are literate in more than 500 characters; 12 people have participated in civil schools and are literate in more than 200 characters; all 28 school-age children are enrolled. Under the leadership of Zhang Zhiquan, a reading group of 12 people was organized, subscribing to one copy each of the Shanxi Daily and the Shanxi Peasant Daily. Dazhai, a barren and poor village, has become a prosperous Dazhai, and the ignorance and backwardness left to the peasants by feudal rule has disappeared forever.

　　张志全领导大寨村由穷变富
    去年，在男劳动力比抗战前减少百分之二十八的情况下，每亩土地平均产量超过抗战前百分之十。
    山西省榆社县浊漳河畔，有个大寨村，庄稼长的特别粗壮，果实结得肥大。如果你走进村去访问一下，农民们便会告诉你：他们由于互助组搞得好，重视了生产技术的改进，去年，在男劳动力比抗战前减少百分之二十八的情况下，每亩土地平均产量还超过抗战前百分之十。这个村子已被选为全县生产模范村。领导这个村子生产的是张志全。
    张志全是共产党员，在一九四四年即被选为劳动英雄，一九四六年参加太行区二届劳动模范大会，当选为太行区一等劳动英雄。这次，又当选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。
  互助组诞生了
    一九四四年秋天，日寇扫荡太行解放区。鬼子驻在离大寨村十五里地的翟管、桃阳。这时，群众要支援战争，还要马上收割熟在地里的庄稼。在万分紧急的情况下，张志全发动了二十人，组织起两个互助组，自己任拨工队长，领导前后方变工。经过半个月的抢割抢收，完成了秋收。第二年张志全领导互助组继续搞下去。又根据群众的意见，创造了工票板。按劳力评分，使用工票，解决了算账的困难。这年，互助组已扩大到三十户。
    一九四六年春天，张志全从县农场拿回一斗金皇后玉茭，二斗一六九小麦的优良品种，发动大家种植。因为没有经验，当年良种庄稼长得并不好。但他没有灰心，在劳模大会上，他为此专门访问了劳动英雄李顺达。这年，他们互助组的记工方法，又改用了按活评分和升降的制度。安排工作时，又注意了按技术好坏及劳动强弱。互助组进一步发展与巩固了。全村四十六户，参加互助的已有三十九户，占总户数百分之八十五；组织起来的劳动力，占全村劳动力百分之九十。
    一九四七年春，张志全互助组开始注意改进生产技术。播种时，他发动群众浸种。有些人嫌麻烦，还有人怕把种子浸死了。他自己便先用温汤浸了三亩地谷种和二亩玉茭种。种子不但没浸死，庄稼还长得特别强。秋天，人民政府号召秋耕。群众认为耕了谷茬，下年不结豆荚。张志全首先响应号召，耕了五亩。来年（一九四八年）春播时，张志全除了七亩豆子，八亩山药、瓜菜外，其余庄稼全部浸了种。在他带动下，张在元、张根全也开始浸种了。去年他秋耕的地，今年种上豆子，不但按时出苗，而且苗旺垅齐。有人说：不看苗旺看结荚。秋天，豆荚结满秸秆。张志全就用事实广泛宣传垡茬的好处，组织群众到地里参观。事实打破了群众的保守思想。庄稼收获后，张志全的地全部耕过，部分群众也开始秋耕了。秋收中，他还组织群众参观了自己种的八一一谷、金皇后玉茭。群众见了庄稼连声称好，争着要求留种。收完后，一亩半八一一谷打了五石（每石合一百六十多斤），半亩金皇后打了一石五斗。这就打下了推广优良品种的基础。
    当年（一九四八年）解放战争打得很激烈，解放区的农民大批涌向前线参加战争勤务。晋中战役时，大寨村的二十八个全劳动力参战了二十个；七头毛驴参战走了五头。在极端困难的条件下，张志全发动了二十五个妇女参加变工互助，克服了劳畜力不足的困难，做到了支援前线和生产两不误。
  重视提高技术
    由于组织起来克服了各种困难，一九四七年到一九四八年，大寨村土地产量已接近了战前水平。互助组更提出：“提高技术，改变战争中图快不图好的作法，进一步提高生产。”于是，一九四九年，是大寨农业技术发展得最快的一年。春天，张志全根据群众的要求，发动十二个有技术的老农，组成技术研究会，提倡改良技术。首先在耕作时，选择了耕作技术好的老农掌犁，做到犁深耙细。播种时，他继续发动群众浸种。常福组仍不浸，结果张志全组的苗子长得齐垅，常福组的二十五亩谷子连种三次才捉住苗。秋后，又开群众大会总结浸种拌种，会上群众公认张志全组一连浸种三年，庄稼没有一棵生病的。大家明确了浸种的效用。种麦时，全村一百二十二亩麦田，只有三亩没浸种。同时，张志全还领导全村进一步的研究锄苗技术，提出了“玉茭地里卧下牛（即对三角留），茭子（高粱）地里卧下狗，坡地小豆播下手”。锄地前，提出“谷锄寸，顶上粪”的口号。但有的群众说：“谷锄寸中‘脐风’，非到四十天不能挖。”当时他没有去争辩，谷子长到一寸高，他就带领自己小组都锄了。谷子锄过不但没中“脐风”，苗儿却长得粗又大。张小三谷子锄晚了，苗小又黄。技术研究会还领导大家改良锄草技术，实行了“头锄浅又精，二锄深又平，三锄上堆圆蓬蓬”。由于生产技术的改进，一九四九年大寨村平均产量已超过战前水平。
    今年大寨村更加注意了农业技术改良。播种时，全村已有四十九户采用各种优良品种了。张志全为了进一步研究品种，专门抽出一亩二分好地，试种了十六种谷子，八分地试种了十二种杂粮。另外还组织了四户特约户，试种优良品种十余种。下种时试种的种籽都进行了浸拌，因地施肥。群众参观他试种的成绩都说：和县农场一样。以后大家就叫它“小农场”。今年，全村种的三百七十亩谷子全部浸了种，玉茭、高粱浸种也达百分之九十以上。此外，技术研究会又根据去年张怀元胶泥地垫沙，张补成垫白土多打粮食的事实，推广全村改良土壤一百五十六亩，预计全年可增产三十一石（每亩二斗计）。
    大寨村在改进农业技术中，还注意了改良农具。他们创造了单人播种犁（犁上带一漏斗，犁把凿有输籽管，一个人随犁随种，宜用于种豆），使下种工作省一个人（一般播种需用二人）。天旱时种籽并可通过输籽管直达犁底湿土里（宜深土播种的种籽适用）。今年已有十六户用此犁下种。
    张志全互助组领导得好，他的主要经验是：（一）组织起来与提高技术紧密相结合。大寨互助组在战争中生长起来，并逐渐提高产量，主要关键就是认识了提高技术的重要，在群众觉悟的基础上，提高技术与巩固发展互助组紧密的相结合。（二）充分发扬了民主，真正做到了等价交换。张志全互助组由小到大，由临时到经常，经过了记工折工、到实行“工票”、“就地评工”、“按活评工”等办法，逐步做到了合理等价。做活安排，也根据季节地势等条件，分别缓急，民主评议。这样，不仅克服了某些组员只顾自己不管别人的自私思想，使互助组逐步的走上了扩大和巩固。（三）科学技术与实际经验相结合。农业技术的改进，都是先实验后推广，用已成功的事实推动群众。大寨村每次技术改良，都遇到了群众思想抵抗，但张志全遇到这种情况时，他就先亲自试验，作出样子，然后通过田间参观，用实例打破群众保守思想，推广全村。
  走向富裕
    由于生产搞得好，大寨村已由穷变富。该村战前三十五户，一百七十四人，土地八百七十六亩五厘。但在这些土地中，城内地主的即占有六百亩，两户富农占有九十余亩，中贫农三十三户，仅有薄地一百八十余亩。农民每年交了租粮绝大多数缺吃无穿。抗战以后，在共产党和人民政府领导下，张志全带领大家实行了减租减息，土地改革，劳动互助，改良技术，他们的土地产量大大增加了。该村战前平均每年产粮九百六十四石（连交租在内），一九四七年已恢复到产粮九百五十四石，一九四八年因歉收降到七百三十九石，但一九四九年大量开展增产运动中，产量已增到了一千一百五十八石，平均每亩超过战前水平一斗一升。今年生产比去年更好了，产量更会提高。由于生产的发展，群众生活显著提高。过去糠菜半年粮的现象再也见不到了。全村五十三户，除三户因不会经营，缺三个月吃用外，绝大部分的粮食够一年吃用，有二十四户积余粮三百三十石，有五户存粮够三年吃用。牲畜的发展已达到了战前水平。全村已有牲口二十五头，羊一百二十五只，猪二十九只（战前全村只两户富农有两只猪）。今春新买骡子两头，大车两辆，修盖新房十五间，安了碾子两盘，还有十二户购下盖三十余间房的木料。
    大寨村由于农民经济生活的上升，文化生活也开始发展。一九四七年成立了小学校一座（战前无学校，只有七个富户子弟识字）。三年来有十个青年参加青年补习班，识字五百以上；十二人参加民校，识字二百以上；二十八个学龄儿童，全部入学。在张志全带头下，并组织十二人的读报小组，订了山西日报和山西农民报各一份。地瘠人穷的大寨，变成了富裕的大寨，封建统治遗留给农民的愚昧落后，已一去不复返了。
