Glimpses of the Liberated Areas of Vietnam

Editor's Note: Fei Ge'er is the General Secretary of the French Republican Youth League and former president of the Avant-Garde newspaper. During the occupation of France by the Hitlerite bandits, he was a prominent leader in the French youth struggle. In April of this year, he visited the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for several weeks at the invitation of the Vietnam Youth League. After returning to France, he gave a report to the Paris press on July 13th. This article is a part of that report. According to recent news, the reactionary French government has ordered his arrest for reporting the true situation in Vietnam.

During my two-month stay in Vietnam, I visited dozens of collective activities of various scales, visited various mass organizations, and traveled hundreds of kilometers, sometimes by car, sometimes on horseback, and sometimes on foot.

Wherever I went, I had the same feeling: the Vietnamese people, regardless of their class origin or political views, are united under the same strong will—to strive for the real unification and full independence of the entire country.

People not only say this, but the majority of the people demonstrate their will to strive for unification and independence through great sacrifices, rare heroism, and in the arenas of war and labor. This is more clearly manifested in the sincere unity of the Vietnamese nation. The unity of Vietnam can never be broken by military oppression or political conspiracies.

(I) The Economic Situation of the Liberated Areas

In northern Vietnam, not only are the basic military forces concentrated, but also government organs and a large number of residents evacuated from the cities.

These millions of people live in rugged highlands, and the production of food was insufficient to meet the needs of the local residents before the war.

The French Expeditionary Force Command was not unaware of this situation. Since its offensives suffered sharp defeats in 1947 and 1948, it has tried every means to blockade these areas inhabited by armed people and cut off any supplies from the occupied areas in order to eliminate the armed forces of the Vietnamese people.

To this end, the French military command can be said to have exhausted all means. For example, destructive bombing of crops; setting fire to ripe rice crops about to be harvested; and the cruel method of slaughtering farmers who transport grain and non-staple food from the occupied areas to the liberated areas upon capture.

However, the occupation forces command miscalculated in trying to intimidate the Vietnamese people with these means. The so-called policy of blockade and creating famine is destined to fail completely. I can assure you that there will be no famine in the Vietnamese liberated areas this year.

There Will Be No Famine

I participated in the collective labor of Vietnamese soldiers and civil servants, including ministers. Whether around military camps or office locations, they cut down trees and cultivated land. It is expected that a large amount of vegetables will be produced this summer.

I specifically participated in the amazing conscious labor of North Vietnamese farmers. They opened up vast virgin forests and planted edible plants, corn, and grains. In addition, they are working hard to improve rice fields, and rice paddies that previously only had one harvest can now have two harvests.

On the routes in the fertile area of the Tonkin Gulf Delta, I saw rows of farmers crossing the French military lines, risking danger, and carrying rice on shoulder poles or bicycles to supply the needs of the army and the people.

Currently, land reform has not been universally implemented in the Vietnamese liberated areas. However, land belonging to French colonial corporations, land belonging to large landlords who colluded with the colonial authorities, and other ownerless land have been temporarily distributed to poor peasants and landless laborers. In some areas, vast public lands have been newly distributed.

Recently, the Vietnamese government decided to give priority to implementing policies to reduce land rents and reduce interest rates on cash and in-kind loans; as is well known, usury with cruel exploitation has always existed in Indochina.

In order to prove the prestige of the Vietnamese government in the countryside and the patriotic enthusiasm of all classes, I would like to cite the example of the land donation movement, which is unfolding in the already completely liberated north-central Vietnam, as a very important fact. Landlords, in response to the government's call, donated part of their valuable land for the government to distribute to the families of soldiers.

Industry in the Forests

The industry in the liberated areas is developing at an astonishing rate. The Vietnamese people moved factory machinery from the cities to the depths of the forests and then re-equipped them. The industrial equipment of this kind that I visited was diverse. There are printing factories, as well as paper mills that use bamboo as the main raw material to manufacture all the paper used for combat propaganda and publishing. Particularly exciting is the arms industry. This industrial sector has tens of thousands of workers who are constantly improving technology. Now, it not only produces various infantry weapons, but also produces a large number of hand grenades, rifles, light and heavy mortars, and even howitzers.

In such factories, working conditions are certainly difficult. In the forests, sanitation is inadequate, transportation is difficult, and raw materials are insufficient. However, the skills and perseverance of workers and experts have overcome these difficulties. When I discovered that they were using water pipes moved from the city as rifle barrels, and even using gas storage iron cylinders to make mortar bodies, I couldn't help but marvel. Even the frames of the mortars were made from metal pillars moved from the railway. In addition, the Vietnamese people are also developing various mineral deposits of coal, iron, and non-ferrous metals. From now on, in North Vietnam, the production of pig iron and sulfuric acid is sufficient to meet the needs of industry.

In addition to state-owned industry, private industry in the form of handicrafts also makes a great contribution to the war. The workers and staff of these enterprises paid a heavy price of sacrifice. At the same time, they are armed combatants, and there are countless examples of them fighting the invaders to protect factory equipment and protect the relocation of machines. I want to say that one of these companies has been relocated three times, and readers can imagine the extent of the sacrifice of manual transportation, because there is no other way to transport them, and some machines weigh more than one ton.

The entire country was isolated from the outside world until the end of 1949, and continued to fight a powerful enemy equipped with superior equipment. Under these conditions, the Vietnamese people have not only maintained military victories, but also stabilized and developed the economic base, and ensured a minimum supply of materials to all regions. This is true from northern to southern Vietnam, including the most difficult areas of former Cochinchina.

(II) Cultural Progress by Leaps and Bounds

The various economic conditions I mentioned above cannot alone express the entire Vietnamese people's spirit of sacrifice and the great power of construction. The cultural life in the Vietnamese liberated areas is also worthy of attention.

In the areas full of thorns, I met famous writers, political commentators, musicians, and artists. They had no complaining expressions at all. They left their relatively comfortable homes in cities such as Hue, Hanoi, or Saigon as early as 1946 and joined the ranks of resistance to aggression, and began to create in the forests. All the famous writers and artists have left the cities. Literary magazines generally published in French-occupied cities have to plagiarize most of the articles published by authors in the forests. At the same time, the music broadcast by Hanoi Radio is basically adopted from the songs composed by the musicians of the Vietnamese People's Underground Army.

When the puppet government Bao Dai adopted the national anthem, it adopted "Youth Song" without seeking the author's consent. This song was composed by a young, talented musician. I talked to him in the area governed by the democratic government. He leads an organization of children and teenagers.

The material difficulties of writers and artists can be imagined, but these difficulties have never prevented the development of culture in the liberated areas.

The number of publications and books of various kinds, including poetry collections, works of art, etc., published is staggering.

The monthly magazine "Literature and Art" of the Vietnam Artists and Writers Association is published in thousands of copies every month. There are also many artistic activities such as exhibitions of art works.

When I visited the All-Vietnam Guerrilla Congress, I was amazed by the exhibition of more than 300 paintings, all of which were based on the facts of party members' battles. But without a doubt, the art that has been highly developed is music. Currently, everywhere in the country, you can hear soldiers, workers, and farmers singing moving and combative songs.

Literary and Art School in the Forest

In my memory of visiting Vietnam, the most impressive thing was the visit to the National Literary and Art School, just a few days after the opening ceremony.

This school is in a large village in the forest. All the buildings are made of bamboo. Hundreds of students study in groups according to their interests in the army, factories, and rural literature and art.

The teachers of this school are the most famous painters, writers, and musicians in Vietnam. The school also has a drama group with a very good theater built of bamboo.

From a short new work of the play, I felt admiration for the traditional Vietnamese drama.

Although a difficult war is going on, and under conditions of material scarcity, the government is still committed to such a large-scale school. There is no doubt that such a government has confidence in the future.

A university including four colleges has been built in northern Vietnam, but other colleges cannot be established due to a lack of teachers (a large number of them serve in the army and government agencies).

In any case, the number of Vietnamese students in this university is much larger than that in Hanoi University.

I have been to many primary and secondary schools. The number of schools has increased tenfold compared with before the war. Currently, there is no county without a school and no provincial capital without a middle school in the liberated areas. The facilities are very simple, and there is a great lack of secondary school textbooks, but the young teachers are mostly former university students. Due to their enthusiastic work, the results achieved, according to the university authorities, exceed the original plan.

The Struggle to Eliminate Illiteracy

In the struggle to eliminate illiteracy, the Vietnamese government has achieved amazing results.

The movement to eliminate illiteracy has aroused competition between social groups and administrative organs. Among the provinces and counties, the ones that first announced the eradication of local illiteracy include the provinces of Nam Dinh and Ninh Binh in the Tokyo Triangle. Some provinces completely eradicated illiteracy last year, as did the provinces in north-central Vietnam. The promoters of Vietnamese people's education apply various methods to achieve the goal of eradicating all illiteracy.

I have personally seen a place using the following method to encourage literacy.

At the entrance of a market in a county, two doors, large and small, were opened. The large one allows literate people to enter and exit, and illiterate people can only enter and exit through the small door. To pass through the big door, you must at least be able to read the words on the sign on the door. Women and farmers who cannot read are asked to go to a small door and go to a large room for an hour of class. Taking classes and coming to the market often is the most effective way to learn to write or read. In addition, landlords are forced to teach the workers they employ to read. If the landlord does not comply, the people's education agency will send the illiterate to school, and all expenses will be borne by the landlord.

### 越南解放区见闻

　　越南解放区见闻
    编者按：斐盖尔是法兰西共和青年联盟总书记，前卫报社长，在希特勒匪帮占领法国期间，他就是法国青年斗争中著名领袖之一。今年四月间他应越南青年联盟的邀请，到越南民主共和国参观了几个星期。返法后，曾于七月十三日对巴黎新闻界作了一个报告。本篇就是报告中的一部分。据最近消息，因为他报道了越南的真实情况，法国反动政府竟下令逮捕他。
    在停留越南的两个月期间，我参观了几十处规模不同的集体活动，访问了各种民众组织，走了几百公里，有时坐车，有时骑马，有时步行。
    随便到一个地方，我都有同样的感觉：越南人民不论阶级出身和政见如何，都团结在同一个坚强意志之下——争取全国真正的统一和全面的独立。
    人们不仅在口里这样说，多数人民以伟大的牺牲、罕见的英勇及战争与劳动场所里表现出来他们争取统一和独立的意志。这在越南民族的精诚团结中表现得更清楚。越南的团结决不是军事压迫政治阴谋所能击破的。
            （一）解放区的经济现状
    在越南北部，不但集中了基本的军力，还有政府机关和自城市撤退的大量居民。
    这数百万人民，生活在崎岖的高原，食粮的生产在战前是不足供应当地居民的需要的。
    法国远征军统帅部对这情况并非不知道。自一九四七和一九四八年它的进攻遭到尖锐的失败以后，为了消灭越南人民的武装力量，想尽办法要封锁这些地区武装了的人民，并设法切断来自占领区的任何补给。
    法军统帅部为了这个目的，可算用尽了一切手段。例如对农作物施以破坏性的轰炸；对收割在即的熟稻放火烧毁；对从占领区运粮食和副食到解放区的农民，一经捕获即予屠杀等恶毒办法。
    然而，占领军统帅部想用这些手段吓倒越南人民，是估计错误了。所谓封锁政策和制造灾荒，是注定要全面失败的。我可以向各位保证：今年越南解放区决无灾荒可言。
            灾荒就不会有了
    我参加过越南战士们及包括部长在内的公务员们的集体劳动。无论军营驻扎地或办公场所的周围，他们都砍伐树木。开辟耕地。预计今年夏季就可以出产多量的菜蔬。
    我特地参加了北越农民惊人的自觉劳动。他们开伐了广大的处女林，种植可供食用的植物、玉米和谷物。此外，并努力改良稻田，从前仅有一次收获的水田，现在可以收获两次。
    在东京湾三角洲富饶地区的通路上，我看见成行列的农民，穿过法军警戒线，冒着危险，用扁担或自行车搬运稻米，以补给军队和人民的需要。
    目前越南解放区尚未普遍实行土地改革。然而属于法国殖民者大公司的土地，与殖民当局勾结的大地主的土地及其他无主的土地，都已临时分配给贫农和无地的雇农了。某些部分地区广大的公地实行了新的分配。
    最近越南政府决定尽先实行减少地租，减少现金及实物借贷的利率政策；众所周知，在印度支那向来是存在着残酷剥削的高利贷的。
    为了证明越南政府在农村中的威信及各阶层的爱国热忱，我特举献田运动为例，这运动在业已全部解放的中越北部展开着，是一件很重要的事实。地主们为了响应政府的号召，捐献了部分值钱的土地，借供政府分配于战士家属之用。
            森林里的工业
    解放区的工业正在惊人的发展着。越南人民将城市里的工厂机器迁入森林的深处，然后重新配备。我所参观的诸如此类的工业设备是多方面的。有印刷工厂，还有以竹为主要原料，制造斗争宣传与出版上应用的全部纸张的造纸工厂。尤足令人兴奋的是军火工业。这项工业部门有成千成万的工人，不断的在改进技术，现在不但出产各种步兵武器，同时还能制造大量的手榴弹、快枪、轻重迫击炮以至于榴弹炮。
    在这样的工厂中，工作条件当然是困难的。在森林中，卫生设备不够，运输艰苦，原料不足。然而工人和专家的技巧与毅力却克服了这些困难。当我发现他们用自城市搬来的水管，作快枪筒，甚至于用贮气铁筒造成迫击炮身的时候，我不免暗暗称奇。就连迫击炮的架子，也是用从铁路搬来的金属支柱改造的。此外越南人民还开发着煤、铁以及非铁金属的各种矿藏。从现在起，在北越方面，生铁和硫酸的生产足供工业上的需要。
    在国营工业之外，手工生产形式的私营工业，对战争也有着极大的贡献。这些企业的工人职员付出了重大的牺牲代价。同时他们又是武装的战斗员，他们为了保卫工厂设备，与保护机器迁移同侵略者作战的例子不胜枚举。我要说的在这类企业中有一家曾迁移过三次，读者可以想像得到用人工运输的牺牲之大，因为没有别的搬运方法，而有些机器重量在一吨以上。
    整个国家直至一九四九年底尚与外界隔离，继续与装备优良的强大敌人作战。在这种条件下，越南人民不仅能保持军事上的胜利，还稳定了并发展了经济基础，保证了各地最低限度的物资供应。从越南北部到南部包括前交趾支那最困难的区域都是如此。
            （二）飞跃进展的文化
    我上面所说的关于经济的各种状况，并不能单独表现出整个越南人民的牺牲精神以及建设的伟大力量。越南解放区的文化生活也是值得注意的。
    在满布荆棘的区域，我遇见了著名的作家、政论家、音乐家和艺术家。他们丝毫没有抱怨的神情。他们从一九四六年就离开了顺化、河内或西贡等城市中比较舒适的家庭，投到抵抗侵略的队伍中来，在森林中开始创作。凡是著名的作家和艺术家都离开了城市。一般在法国占领下的城市中出版的文学杂志，不得不抄袭森林中一般作者们发表的大部文章。同时河内广播的音乐，基本上也是采用越南人民地下军的音乐家们所编的歌曲。
    当傀儡政府保大采用国歌时，并未征求作者的同意即采用了《青年歌》。这首歌曲是一位年青的天才乐师所作。我曾在民主政府管辖的地区与他谈过，他领导着一个儿童和少年的组织。
    作家和艺术家在物质方面的困难是可以想像得到的，然而这些困难始终阻止不了解放区文化的发展。
    各种性质的刊物和书籍，包括诗集、艺术作品等，出版的数量是惊人的。
    越南艺术家和作家协会的月刊《文艺》每月都发行数千册。艺术的活动如艺术作品展览会也不少。
    当我访问全越游击队代表大会时，我对那三百多幅图画的展览会，不胜赞叹，作品都是以党员战斗事实为题材的。但是毫无疑问，在艺术中得到高度发展的还是音乐。目前在全国各地都能听到士兵、工人、农民唱着动人的有战斗性的歌曲。
            林中的文艺学校
    在我访问越南的记忆中，印象最深的要算对国立文艺学校的访问，正是举行开学典礼后的几天。
    这个学校在森林中的一个大村庄里。一切建筑都是竹造的。几百个学生根据自己对于军队、工厂、农村文艺的志趣而分组学习。
    这所学校的教员都是越南最著名的画家、文学家和音乐家。学校并设有戏剧组，有一所很好的用竹子建筑的剧院。
    从一出短短的剧本的新作品里，我对越南传统的戏剧感到了钦佩。
    虽然进行着艰苦的战争，在物质缺乏的条件下，政府仍致力于如此规模宏大的学校，这样的政府无可否认未来是具有信心的。
    越南北部建有一所包括四个学院的大学，唯因缺乏教员（他们大批服务于军队及政府机关）致使其他学院不能成立。
    不管怎样，这所大学里的越南学生人数比河内大学要多得多。
    我到过很多的小学和中学，学校的数量比战前增加了十倍，目前在解放区没有一个县没有学校，没有一个省会没有中学。其中设备都很简单，中学教本感到非常缺乏，但年青的教员们大部是从前的大学生，由于他们热心的工作，所获效果据大学当局的意见，超过原定计划的。
            扫除文盲的斗争
    在扫除文盲的斗争中，越南政府获得了惊人的成绩。
    扫除文盲的运动引起了社会团体与行政机关之间的竞赛。在省和县中，首先宣布肃清本地文盲的有东京三角地带的省份南定、宁平等一些省份去年就已全部肃清了文盲，在中越北部的省份，亦是如此。越南人民教育的推动者们应用各种各样的方法来达到肃清全部文盲的目的。
    我曾亲眼看见一个地方用下面的方法鼓励识字。
    在一个县里的市场入口处开了大小两道门，大的可以让识字的人出入，不识字的只能由小门出入。要想从大门经过，最低限度要读得出门上那块牌子上的字，不能读的妇女、农人们就请他们走小门，到一间大屋里上一小时的课。上课和经常到市场来是学习写或读最有效的方法。此外强迫地主教授其雇用的工人识字，如果地主不照办，人民教育机关就把文盲送入学校，全部费用叫地主担负。
