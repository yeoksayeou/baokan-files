Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 23rd (TASS dispatch): The UN General Committee met on the morning of September 22nd to continue reviewing two items on the provisional agenda that it had postponed yesterday (September 21st): the “Formosa Question” proposed by the United States and the Soviet Union's accusation of U.S. aggression against China. After the Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu requested a two- or three-day postponement of the "Formosa Question" due to still awaiting instructions, the committee decided to grant this request. Five members of the committee voted in favor of the postponement, one against, and the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries abstained.

The committee voted to include the Soviet proposal on the agenda, with eleven countries voting in favor, the Kuomintang representative voting against, and the Netherlands and Thailand abstaining.

The committee approved the proposal to establish a “Special Political Committee” without discussion, and also approved the proposal to hold a joint meeting of the Economic Committee and the Social Committee. After a brief discussion, the committee agreed to submit several agenda items directly to the UN General Assembly without prior submission to the committees. These items included: applications for admission of new member states, international control of atomic energy, the drafting and adoption of a twenty-year plan for peace through the United Nations, and a convention on the declaration of death of missing persons. The committee then allocated the items to the First (Political and Security) Committee and the Special Political Committee. The Netherlands suggested that the following agenda items be submitted to the Political Committee: the question of Korean independence; the "United Action for Peace" proposal; the declaration for the elimination of the threat of new war and the strengthening of international peace and security—the Soviet proposal; the threat to the political independence and territorial integrity of Greece; the Kuomintang's false accusation of threatening China's political independence and territorial integrity and peace in the Far East; and the accusation of the alleged Soviet failure to repatriate prisoners of war. The Soviet representative, Malik, then requested the General Committee to submit the Soviet proposal, which it had approved for inclusion on the agenda this morning—the accusation of U.S. aggression against China—to the Political Committee. The committee approved Malik's proposal, with only the Kuomintang representative opposing.

When considering the Dutch proposal to submit various items on the agenda to the Special Political Committee, India urged that India's accusation of the treatment of Indians in South Africa be referred to the First Political Committee rather than the Special Political Committee, but the General Committee rejected this request. The General Committee also recommended that the following issues be submitted to the Special Political Committee: the question of the former Italian colonies, the adjustment of the border between Egypt and Libya, the relations between the United Nations member states and specialized agencies and Franco's Spain, the Palestine question, the question of the recognition of the representatives of member states by the United Nations, and "the question of Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania's observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms" (the Soviet Union abstained when voting on this recommendation, having previously opposed including this item on the agenda on September 21st), and the report of the Security Council. Subsequently, the committee unanimously approved the Secretariat's various recommendations, referring the remaining issues to other committees. However, when voting on referring the "radio interference" section of the "Freedom of Information" item to the Social Committee, the Soviet delegation abstained. The General Committee's agenda was thus completed, and the committee adjourned.

　　联大综合委员会结束讨论议程工作
    苏控美侵略我国案列入议程
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十三日电：联大综合委员会于九月二十二日上午开会，继续审议它昨天（九月二十一日）延期处理的临时议程中的两个项目——美国所提的“福摩萨问题”和苏联对美国侵略中国的控诉案。在国民党代表蒋廷黻因仍未接获训令而要求把“福摩萨问题”延期两三天处理后，委员会即决定同意这个要求。委员会的五个会员投票赞成延期，一个反对，苏联美国及其他国家弃权。
    委员会通过把苏联的提案列入议程，十一国投票赞成，国民党代表反对，荷兰及泰国弃权。
    委员会未经讨论即通过成立“特别政治委员会”的提案，并通过举行经济委员会及社会委员会联席会议的提案。委员会在短时间讨论后，即同意把若干议程项目不预先提交各委员会即提交联大全体会议。这些项目包括：新会员国入会案，国际管制原子能案，制订通过联合国谋取和平的二十年计划案，宣告失纵人士死亡公约案。委员会继即把各项目分配与第一（政治及安全）委员会及特别政治委员会。荷兰建议把下列议程项目提交政治委员会：朝鲜独立问题案；“维持和平的统一行动案”；消除新战争威胁及加强国际和平与安全的宣言案——苏联的提案；对希腊政治独立及领土完整的威胁案：国民党关于威胁中国政治独立与领土完整及远东和平的诬告案；控诉所谓苏联未能遣送战俘案。苏联代表马立克继即要求综合委员会把它今晨通过列入议程的苏联提案——对美国侵略中国的控诉案——提交政治委员会。委员会通过马立克的提议，只有国民党代表反对。
    在审议荷兰关于提交特别政治委员会的议程内各项目的建议时，印度曾敦促把印度控诉对南非境内印度人待遇案交与第一政治委员会而不应交与特别政治委员会，但综合委员会拒绝了这个请求。综合委员会并建议把下列问题提交特别政治委员会：前意大利殖民地问题，埃及与利比亚边境调整问题，联合国会员国家及专门机构与佛朗哥西班牙关系问题，巴力斯坦问题，联合国承认会员国代表问题，“保加利亚、匈牙利、罗马尼亚遵守人权与基本自由问题”（苏联在表决这项建议时弃权，以前在九月二十一日曾反对把这一项目列入议程），与安全理事会的报告。此后，该委员会无异议通过秘书处的各项建议，把剩余各项问题交与其他委员会，唯在表决把“新闻自由”项目中关于“电波干扰”的部分送交社会委员会时，苏联代表团弃权。综合委员会的议程至此完竣，该委员会即行休会。
