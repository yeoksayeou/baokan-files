Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 2nd: The Security Council held a meeting on September 1st under the chairmanship of British representative Sir Gladwyn Jebb. The provisional agenda included the following important items: the Korean issue, the case of armed aggression against Taiwan (Formosa), and the case of the air force bombing Chinese territory.

After passing the agenda, Jebb immediately invited Chang Myon, the representative of Syngman Rhee, to the meeting, citing the Security Council's previous decision to invite him to discuss the Korean issue. Soviet representative Malik immediately requested to speak on a matter of violating the rules of procedure, arguing that Jebb's ruling was inconsistent with Security Council precedents and procedural rules. Malik pointed out that throughout August, the Soviet delegation had insisted on a fair resolution of the issue, suggesting that the Security Council invite both sides of the dispute to attend simultaneously, and therefore the representative of North Korea should also be invited. Malik declared that the US delegation and the representatives of other countries echoing the same tune, lacking any reason to refute the Soviet proposal, then launched into lengthy distortions of the Charter and refused to invite both sides of the dispute. Malik reiterated that when the Security Council discussed the Indonesian issue, the victim country – Indonesia – and the aggressor country – the Netherlands – were both invited to participate in the discussion; on the Kashmir issue, India and Pakistan were both invited to participate in the discussion of the armed conflict issue, and on the Palestine issue, both sides of the dispute were also invited. Malik asked: What is the reason for changing and undermining the United Nations Charter now? He pointed out that on the Korean issue, the United States, the aggressor country, is sitting in the meeting, relying on the help of its vassal states, and opposing hearing the opinions of the party in Korea that has suffered aggression. Some delegations are trying to find some reasons to justify this refusal. But the real basis for their opposition is because the US delegation is opposing it, and some other countries' delegations feel obliged to follow suit and come out to oppose it as well.

Malik said that the Soviet representative must oppose this shameless action of the United States in trying to bring Chang Myon, a criminal traitor to the Korean people, into the Security Council meeting hall. This behavior proves that the United States and its lackeys have brutally and shamelessly trampled on the Charter, and they only act from their own interests. The ruling groups in the United States are willing to invite individuals who cannot represent anyone, even criminals, to the Security Council. However, because the presence of the North Korean representative would be detrimental to the US ruling groups and their gang in the Security Council (because the North Korean representative might reveal the truth about the US aggression against Korea), when we mention the issue of inviting the North Korean representative, the United States and its gang refuse to invite, while the United Nations Charter and international law give the North Korean representative the legitimate right to express their views when the Security Council discusses the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue. Malik suggested that if some delegations did not blindly follow the actions of the US representative but studied the essence of the issue more carefully, they would come to different conclusions. The Soviet delegation has fought for a month to reach an agreement on the issue of fair representation of both North and South Korea. But seeking fairness and reasonableness from the US ruling groups is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree. The aggressive and brutal US foreign policy, aimed at dominating the world, is completely divorced from the concept of fairness. This explains why the Soviet proposal has been obstructed for a whole month by the group headed by the United States. Malik concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation maintains its original position and insists that its proposal of August 1st to invite representatives from both sides should be put to a vote today before starting the discussion of the Korean issue.

Chairman Jebb, in response to Malik's request to immediately vote on the Soviet proposal to invite representatives from both sides, declared that although the Security Council had rejected Yugoslavia's proposal to invite the North Korean representative on June 25th, he would not object to holding a "new vote" before discussing this agenda item if the member states agreed.

Regarding Malik's opposition to the Chairman issuing an invitation to the representative of Syngman Rhee to participate in the discussion, Jebb said that he should make such a ruling, namely: in view of the Security Council's resolution of June 25th, the Chairman believes that he must invite the representative of South Korea to the meeting.

Thereupon, Malik reiterated the reasons for opposing the Chairman's ruling. Malik cited the precedents of the Security Council to explain that the Chairman could only invite a representative of one party to attend the meeting if there was no opposition, but Jebb's ruling did not have such a condition. In the past, when an objection was raised, the issue had to be put to a vote; the Palestine issue was an example. In addition, during August, the Security Council convened three informal meetings and fourteen formal meetings to discuss the issue of inviting representatives from both sides. In these meetings, the US delegation and its echoers refused to follow the path of peacefully resolving the Korean issue. They were only concerned about the issue of inviting Syngman Rhee's representative. The Soviet delegation had a completely different attitude; they insisted on their position on fairly resolving the issue. The Soviet delegation believed that even if its position on the validity of the June 25th resolution did not change, it was still possible for the Security Council to reach an agreement on the issue of inviting representatives from both sides. Malik said that the Norwegian representative, in replying to the Soviet suggestion, also represented the group that included the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France, and several other countries' delegations. He insisted at the time that only the representative of South Korea should be invited. Malik continued, the Norwegian representative said that the issue of inviting the North Korean representative could be considered, but it must wait until the "police action" had ended and the next stage of discussing the resolution of the Korean issue began. Malik declared, we all know what the "police action" is all about; it is not difficult to understand by looking at the more than 10 billion US dollars that Truman requested for this and the hundreds of thousands of troops armed with the latest weapons. He further said that the Soviet delegation had asked the Norwegian delegation to clarify whether the group for which he spoke was willing to take simultaneous action to invite representatives from both North and South Korea without delaying it to the distant future. He continued, the Soviet delegation had pointed out that when one deals with such issues, one must have a clear understanding, otherwise it will only make things worse. Neither the Norwegian representative nor anyone for whom he was speaking gave the Soviet delegation a concrete answer. Therefore, the Soviet representative judged that the Norwegian representative and those who entrusted him to be their spokesman were unwilling to reach a solution, unwilling to invite the South Korean representative and also invite the North Korean representative. This turned all the informal efforts of the Security Council into nothing, and the communiqué announced that the two sides failed to reach an agreement. Malik continued, in this way, due to the stubbornness of the US delegation, three informal and fourteen formal meetings failed to allow the Security Council to break the deadlock. Therefore, the Soviet Union opposes the Chairman's ruling and requests an immediate vote.

At this point, the Security Council supported Jebb's ruling with nine votes against Malik's one vote, with Jebb abstaining. Then, Jebb suggested voting on the proposal to invite the North Korean representative. Malik pointed out that the Chairman's formulation was inaccurate, and he insisted that the Soviet proposal must be voted on, which proposed to invite "representatives of the Korean people, namely representatives of both North and South Korea," and to hear their statements.

Jebb replied that the Security Council had "effectively invited the representative of South Korea," but if the member states did not object, perhaps the Soviet proposal could be put to a vote.

Norwegian representative Stabel firmly opposed, saying: When voting on the Soviet proposal, if the proposal is rejected, the situation will be difficult, because it cannot be clearly known whether the Chairman's previous ruling that the South Korean representative should attend the meeting still stands. Malik pointed out: The United Nations Charter and procedural rules stipulate that any member state has the right to make any proposal and request that the proposal be put to a vote. In addition, Article 32 of the rules stipulates that unless the original mover agrees to a separate vote, the entire proposal must be put to a vote.

The meeting was adjourned for fifteen minutes at Jebb's suggestion, to wait for the official English translation of the Soviet proposal to be completed before resuming the meeting.

The meeting resumed after the break, and the Chairman then read out the English translation of the Soviet proposal: "The Security Council decides that when discussing the Korean issue, it must invite representatives of the Korean people, namely representatives of North Korea and South Korea, and hear their statements at its meetings."

The Chairman then pointed out: As the Norwegian representative had previously proposed, this proposal may cause various difficulties if it is rejected. The Chairman immediately ruled that: "If the Soviet motion is put to a vote and rejected, the rejection of this motion will not prejudice the right of the representative of the Republic of Korea to attend Security Council meetings when discussing the Korean issue." Malik immediately declared: The Soviet Union cannot agree to this prediction of future events. Malik also reiterated that the Soviet Union has repeatedly stated that the decisions made on the Korean issue in the absence of the Soviet representative and the representative of the Chinese People's Government are illegal.

Then, Egyptian representative Fawzi explained that if the Chairman insisted on voting on the Chairman's ruling, he would not participate in the vote. However, Jebb insisted on a vote because of the Soviet representative's opposition. Only the Soviet representative voted against the Chairman's ruling, while the United States, the United Kingdom, France, India, Norway, Ecuador, Cuba, and the Kuomintang representative voted in favor of the Chairman, Yugoslavia abstained, and Egypt did not participate in the vote.

Then, Jebb suggested voting on the Soviet proposal, but Fawzi raised a procedural issue and said that the wording of the Soviet proposal should be changed as follows: "The Security Council decides to invite the North Korean representative when discussing the Korean issue, and hear the representative's statement at its meetings."

Malik repeated that the most absurd and illogical attitude is to advocate inviting the South Korean representative while excluding the North Korean representative. He explained that if the Egyptian representative kept in mind that this is the root cause of the matter, he would understand the absurdity of his own logic.

Indian representative Rau said that regarding the attendance of the South Korean representative, the Security Council has already "taken a decision," so Rau will only discuss the issue of the attendance of the representative of the "North Korean authorities." He then agreed that North Korea should be excluded because the Security Council sometimes receives reports from the "United Nations Military Commander," which may be valuable to the "enemy." He concluded by saying that the Indian government believes that the issue of inviting North Korea should be raised again after the military operations have ended when there is a "possibly controversial" need for the Security Council to review it. "Therefore, I will vote against the suggestion to invite the North Korean representative at present, and I emphasize, at present."

Cuban representative Alvarez then declared that he would vote against the Soviet suggestion. Malik then replied to the Indian representative's law-abiding argument. He said that no lawyer can point out any provision saying that the Security Council should not invite both sides; in order to narrow the scope of the war rather than expand it, both sides must attend. Malik pointed out that when the Security Council took illegal decisions on June 25th and June 27th, it did not mention which article of the Charter the situation at that time applied to. So Malik re-emphasized that Truman ordered the US military intervention in Korea at noon, and the United States later forced the Security Council to approve the illegal decision in the afternoon. He then pointed out that when the United States forced through this illegal decision on June 27th, the Indian representative was wavering, because as a lawyer, he understood that the US invasion of foreign territory was guilty of illegal action. Malik asked, what right does the Security Council have to refuse to invite North Korea? He said that only the opposition of the United States is preventing the invitation, but this is not a legitimate reason for the Security Council to refuse to invite North Korea.

French representative Chauvel agreed with the Indian position. He declared that he was puzzled by Malik's announcement that the attendance of the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek on June 25th prevented Malik from attending the Security Council, and asked Malik how he would explain his current attendance, because his term as chairman had ended and Chiang Kai-shek was present. Malik replied that the Soviet delegation had put forward several proposals in August aimed at strengthening the cause of peace and security, and now it is necessary to defend these proposals. Jebb, speaking as the British representative, said that he fully agreed with the speech of Indian representative Rau.

Then the Security Council rejected the Soviet proposal to invite both sides to participate with eight votes against two votes – the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia – and Egypt "did not participate." Therefore, Jebb allowed the representative of Syngman Rhee, Zhang, to speak. He spoke for more than half an hour, wantonly slandering the Soviet Union and the Korean People's Government. After that, the Security Council decided to meet again on September 5th and then adjourned the meeting.

### 安理会会议讨论朝鲜问题  苏代表坚持邀请朝鲜战争的双方出席  美英集团无理拒绝邀北朝鲜代表参加

　　安理会会议讨论朝鲜问题
    苏代表坚持邀请朝鲜战争的双方出席
    美英集团无理拒绝邀北朝鲜代表参加
    【新华社二日讯】塔斯社纽约二日讯：安全理事会在英国代表杰伯担任主席之下于九月一日举行会议。临时议程包括下列各重要项目：朝鲜问题，武装侵略台湾（福摩萨）案及空军轰炸中国领土案。
    杰伯在通过议程后，立即引据安理会以前所作邀请李承晚代表张勉出席讨论朝鲜问题的决定将张勉邀请到会。苏联代表马立克立即要求就违反议事规则问题发言，认为杰伯的裁决与安理会先例和程序规则不符。马立克指出：在整个八月份中，苏联代表团坚持公平解决这个问题，建议安理会邀请争端双方同时出席，因此也须邀请北朝鲜的代表。马立克宣称：美国代表团及弹着同一个调子的其他国家的代表团，由于缺乏任何理由来反驳苏联的建议，于是就长篇大论地曲解宪章，并拒绝邀请争端的双方。马立克再度指出：在安理会讨论印尼问题时，被害国——印尼及侵略国——荷兰——都被邀参加讨论；在克什米尔问题上，印度与巴基斯坦都被邀请参加讨论武装冲突的问题，还有在巴勒斯坦问题上，争论的双方也都被邀请参加。马立克问道：现在来更改与破坏联合国的宪章，理由在那里呢？他指出：在朝鲜问题上，美国这个侵略国家坐在会议席上，仗着附庸国家的帮助，反对听取朝鲜遭受侵略的一方的意见。有些代表团企图为这种拒绝找出一些理由。但是他们所以反对，真正的基础是因为美国代表团在反对，而其他某些国家的代表团感到他们有义务跟着跑，也出来加以反对的。
    马立克说：苏联代表一定要反对美国这种竭力要把朝鲜人民的犯罪的叛徒张勉带进安理会会议厅来的无耻行动。这种行为证明美国及其仆从粗暴无耻地蹂躏了宪章，它们只从自己的利益出发。美国的统治集团愿意把那些并不能代表任何人的个人，甚至是犯罪的人请到安理会来。但是，由于北朝鲜代表的出席对美国统治集团以及它在安理会中的一伙不利（因为北朝鲜代表可能会把美国侵略朝鲜的真相说出来），所以当我们一提起邀请北朝鲜代表的问题时，美国和它那一伙就拒绝邀请，而联合国宪章与国际法却给北朝鲜代表合法的权利，可以在安理会讨论和平解决朝鲜问题时陈述意见。马立克建议道：如果某些代表团不是盲目地追随着美国代表的行动而是更认真地研究问题的本质，它们就会得出不同的结论。为了要在公平解决北、南朝鲜代表列席的问题上取得协议，苏联代表团已经作了一个月的斗争了。但是要想从美国的统治集团方面求得公平合理正好像缘木求鱼。以统治世界为目的的侵略性的、残暴的美国外交政策，是与公平的概念完全无缘的。这就说明为什么苏联的提案整个一个月来遭到了以美国为首的集团的阻挠。马立克最后说：苏联代表团保持它原来的立场，坚持它于八月一日所提出邀请双方代表出席的提案应在今日未开始讨论朝鲜问题之前先行付诸表决。
    主席杰伯在答复马立克所提立即表决苏联所提关于邀请双方代表的提案时宣称：虽然安理会于六月二十五日曾否决南斯拉夫所提邀请北朝鲜代表的提案，但如各理事国同意的话，他并不反对在讨论本项议程之前举行一次“新的表决”。
    对于马立克反对主席向李承晚代表发出参加讨论的请柬一事，杰伯说：他应该作这样的裁决，即：鉴于安理会六月二十五日的决议，主席认为他必须邀请南朝鲜的代表到场。
    于是马立克再次申述反对主席裁决的理由。马立克引用安全理事会的先例说明主席只有在无人反对的情况下才能邀请某一方的代表列席会议，但杰伯的裁决却没有这样的条件。在过去，当有人提出反对时，问题便须付诸表决，巴勒斯坦问题就是一个例子。此外，在八月当中，安理会召集了三次非正式会议和十四次正式会议，讨论邀请双方代表的问题。在这些会议当中，美国代表团及其应声虫拒绝遵循和平解决朝鲜问题的途径。他们关心的只是邀请李承晚的代表的问题。苏联代表团则完全是另一种态度，他们坚持他们关于公平地解决问题的立场。苏联代表团认为，纵使它对于六月二十五日的决议是否有效这个问题的立场不改，安理会各国仍有可能对邀请双方代表的问题取得协议。马立克说，挪威代表在答复苏联的建议时，也就是代表了那个包括美英法三国及若干其他国家代表团的集团，他当时坚持说，只应当邀请南朝鲜一方面的代表。马立克继续说，挪威代表说，邀请北朝鲜代表的问题可以考虑，但必须等到“警察行动”已经终结，开始下一阶段的讨论朝鲜问题的解决的时候。马立克宣称，我们都晓得“警察行动”到底是怎么一回事，看一下杜鲁门为这而要求的一百亿多美元及数十万有最新式武器武装的军队就不难明白。他更进一步说，苏联代表团曾要求挪威代表团说明白，到底由他出面说话的那个集团愿不愿意采取同时的行动邀请南北朝鲜双方代表而不拖延到渺茫的将来。他继续说，苏联代表团曾经指出，当一个人处理到这种问题的时候，必须要有明确的了解，否则便只会坏事。无论挪威代表或者由他代为出面的任何人都未曾给苏联代表具体的答复。因此，苏联代表判断挪威代表和那些托他当代言人的人都不愿意得到一个解决，不愿邀请南朝鲜代表同时也邀请北朝鲜代表。这就使安理会的非正式努力全化为泡影，而且公报宣布说双方未能取得协议。马立克继续说，就这样，由于美国代表团的顽固不化，三次非正式和十四次正式的会议并未能使安理会打破僵局。因此，苏联反对主席的裁决，并要求立即表决。
    至此，安理会以九票对马立克的一票支持杰伯的裁决，杰伯弃权。接着，杰伯建议表决邀请北朝鲜代表的提案。马立克指出主席的提法是不精确的，他坚持必须就苏联的提案进行表决，这提案要求邀请“朝鲜人民的代表，亦即南北朝鲜双方的代表”，并听取其陈述。
    杰伯回答说，安理会已“有效地邀请了南朝鲜的代表”，但是如果各理事国不反对，也许可以就苏联提出的提案进行表决。
    挪威代表斯塔倍尔坚决反对，他说：在表决苏联提案的时候，如果提案被否决时，那时的情况将很难办，因为不能明确地知道主席前此裁决南朝鲜代表出席会议是否仍然成立。马立克指出：联合国宪章和程序规则规定任何一个会员国有权提出任何提案并且要求将提案付诸表决。此外，第三十二条规程规定：除非原动议人同意分段表决，否则必须把整个提案付诸表决。
    会议在杰伯建议下休会十五分钟，俟苏联提案的正式英译工作完成后再行复会。
    会议在休息后复会，主席乃宣读苏联提案的英译文：“安理会决定在讨论朝鲜问题时，必须邀请朝鲜人民的代表，即北朝鲜和南朝鲜的代表，并在其会议上听取他们陈述”。
    主席继而指出：如挪威代表以前所提出的，此项提案在遭到否决时可能引起各种困难。主席当即裁决称：“如将苏联动议付诸表决并被否决时，将不因是项议案被否决而损害大韩民国代表在讨论朝鲜问题时出席理事会会议的权利”。马立克即宣称：苏联不能同意对未来的事件的这种预断。马立克并重申说：苏联已一再声明在苏联代表和中国人民政府的代表缺席时关于朝鲜问题所作的决定是非法的。
    接着埃及代表法齐解释道，假若主席坚持投票表决主席的裁决的话，他便不参加这种表决。然而杰伯却因为苏联代表的反对而坚持要表决。只有苏联代表投票反对主席的裁决，而美国、联合王国、法国、印度、挪威、厄瓜多尔、古巴和国民党代表投票拥护主席，南斯拉夫弃权，埃及则未参加表决。
    接着杰伯建议表决苏联的提案，但是法齐提出议事规则问题，并说苏联提案的措词应改变如下：“安全理事会决定在讨论朝鲜问题时邀请北朝鲜代表，并在其会议上听取该代表陈述。”
    马立克重复说明，最荒谬和最不合逻辑的态度，就是主张邀请南朝鲜代表而排斥北朝鲜代表。他说明，假若埃及代表心里记着这就是事情的根源所在的话，他就会明白他自己的逻辑的荒谬了。
    印度代表劳氏说，关于南朝鲜代表出席问题，安理会已经“采取了决定”，因此劳氏将只讨论“北朝鲜当局”代表列席问题。他随后同意北朝鲜应该予以排除在外，因为安理会有时接到“联合国军事统帅”的报告，这些报告对“敌人”可能是有价值的。他作结语称，印度政府认为邀请北朝鲜问题应该在军事行动结束后“可能有争议”需要安理会予以审议时再提出来。“因此我将投票反对在目前邀请北朝鲜代表的建议，我强调是在目前”。
    古巴代表阿尔渥里兹随即宣称，他将投票反对苏联的建议。马立克于是进行答复印度代表的遵法立义的论据。他说，没有一个律师能够指出任何条款说安理会不应该邀请双方；为了要缩小战事范围而不是扩大它，就必须双方出席。马立克指出，当安理会在六月二十五日和六月二十七日采取非法的决议时，并没有提及当时局势适用宪章的那一条。于是马立克重行强调，杜鲁门于中午下令美国军事干涉朝鲜而美国后来到下午才强使安理会裁可非法决定。他于是指出，当美国于六月二十七日强行通过这个非法决定时，印度代表是动摇的，因为作为一个律师，他了解美国侵犯外国领土是犯有非法行动罪的。马立克问道，安理会有什么权利拒绝邀请北朝鲜。他说，只有美国的反对才阻挠了邀请，然而这不是安理会拒绝邀请北朝鲜的合法理由。
    法国代表萧维尔赞成印度的立场。他宣称，对于马立克所宣布的六月二十五日国民党人蒋氏的出席阻止了马立克参加安理会这一点感到不解，并问马立克将如何解释他现在的出席，因为现在他的主席任期已告结束，而且又有蒋氏在场。马立克回答说，苏联代表团在八月份提出了几项目的在加强和平与安全事业的提案，现在要为这些提案辩护。杰伯以英国代表的身份发言说，他完全赞成印度代表劳氏的演说。
    然后安理会以八票对两票——苏联与南斯拉夫——否决了苏联提出的邀请双方参加的提案，埃及表示“不参加”。所以，杰伯允许李承晚代表张某发言，他发言半小时以上，大肆诽谤苏联与朝鲜人民政府。之后，安理会决定于九月五日再行开会，随即散会。
