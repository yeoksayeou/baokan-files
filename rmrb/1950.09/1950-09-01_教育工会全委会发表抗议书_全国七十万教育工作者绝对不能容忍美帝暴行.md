　　Education Union National Committee Issues Protest
    Nationwide 700,000 Educators Absolutely Cannot Tolerate American Imperialist Atrocities
    [Report from this newspaper] The National Committee of the Chinese Education Union issued a protest on August 30th, expressing a serious protest against the American imperialist aggression against our national sovereignty. The protest stated:

    On August 27th, American imperialist military aircraft intruded into our country's airspace, strafed our stations and vehicles, and slaughtered our compatriots. This act of aggression against our national sovereignty has aroused great indignation among the people of the whole country. The 700,000 educators across the country firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's serious protest to the US government and his just accusation to the United Nations. We absolutely cannot tolerate this atrocity of American imperialism. We will use our mouths and pens to expose this brutal and barbaric behavior of American imperialism in front of the broad masses of the Chinese people. We want to awaken the people of the whole country and the people of the world to a common hatred of American imperialism, and with practical actions, give this mad dog a severe blow and the punishment it deserves.
