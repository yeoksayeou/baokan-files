　　Hankou Railway Sub-bureau Party Committee Holds Party Congress
    Reviewing the Serious Deviation from the Worker Masses and Establishing the Idea of Relying on the Worker Masses to Manage Enterprises Well

    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Changjiang Daily: The Hankou Sub-committee of the Zhengzhou Railway Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held its first Party Representative Conference from August 17th to 25th. Based on the spirit of rectification, the conference summarized and reviewed the work of the past year. The conference was conducted under the direct help of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC, and the Zhengzhou Railway Party Committee. Deng Zihui, the Third Secretary of the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, also personally provided instructions on issues such as relying on the worker masses to manage enterprises.

    After summarizing the tremendous achievements in taking over, restoring transportation, and restoring production in the past year, the conference focused on analyzing and studying the reasons for the current low production morale of workers and the stagnation or even partial decline in production. The conference pointed out that the fundamental problem lies in the Sub-committee's lack of the idea of relying on the worker masses to manage enterprises well and the lack of specific and clear work guidelines, lines, and unified and centralized organizational leadership. Regarding the lack of the idea of relying on the people's masses, the conference criticized the serious rural viewpoint. Due to the existence of this erroneous viewpoint, it was believed that in the past, the world was conquered by relying on the peasants, not by relying on the workers, and therefore the workers were looked down upon. The fact that the worker masses are the leading class of the country and their role in national construction could not be recognized. On the contrary, it was mistakenly believed that the Hankou workers were "two-faced," working when the Japanese were there and working when Chiang Kai-shek came. Therefore, the erroneous conclusion was drawn that "Hankou workers are backward." This led to a forgetful behavior of not caring about the lives and morale of the workers and not serving the workers wholeheartedly. In order to complete the tasks, bureaucratic work styles of coercion, commandism, and taking over everything were adopted. Some cadres even believed that "tasks cannot be completed without a little coercion and commandism." When workers had opinions, they were considered to have low awareness and were not honest; when workers raised difficulties, they were not resolved, and the workers were considered to be emphasizing difficulties. There were even arbitrary suspicions that workers were spies, resulting in the serious error of detaining workers. They were also indifferent to the workers' lives and welfare. When the Zhengzhou area unified and adjusted wages, although wages in the Hankou area were lowered, the workers generally accepted it happily in order to take care of the overall situation and seek wage balance. However, the leadership underestimated the actual difficulties encountered in the workers' lives and did not care enough. Regarding the Ministry of Railways' decision to "charge for medical treatment," the administration and the trade union did not do a good job of explaining and mobilizing the workers, causing the workers to feel that "the Kuomintang and the Japanese did not charge fees, but when the Communist Party came, family members had to pay for medicine, family members had to pay for transportation, water, electricity, and housing." Some even said: "The trade union is the tax bureau, only collecting money from the workers together with the administration." In June and July, wages were reduced by an average of 11%, and five types of employee benefits were cancelled at the same time. Therefore, the workers were very dissatisfied, and their production morale was seriously affected, resulting in production stagnation or even decline. For example, the Jiang'an factory overhauled and delivered 11 locomotives in May and June, but only delivered 4 locomotives in July and August.

    After the Sub-committee reviewed the above issues, the responsible comrades of the trade union and the administration also made work reviews respectively. All the cadres present agreed that the bureaucratic work style of deviating from the worker masses must be corrected, and the idea of relying on the worker masses to manage enterprises well must be established. They also realized that the past attitude of blaming each other and pushing responsibility upwards was wrong, and that they must work hard to study, correct policies, and thoroughly change their work style in order to do a good job.

    The current key tasks of the Hankou Sub-bureau are: completing the renovation of industrial and civil engineering in production, carrying out the model locomotive team movement, and organizing financial and material systems. In order to complete these tasks, the conference determined that it is necessary to strengthen the Party's leadership, rely on the trade union to mobilize the masses, implement democratic management, improve the lives and welfare of employees, do a good job in security work, and cultivate and promote local worker and staff cadres. At the same time, it is necessary to implement the spirit of rectification, establish a complete production viewpoint and mass viewpoint, and correct and overcome the bureaucratic and commandist work styles in the work.

### 汉口铁路分局党委举行党代会  检讨严重脱离工人群众偏向  确立依靠工人群众管好企业的思想

　　汉口铁路分局党委举行党代会
    检讨严重脱离工人群众偏向
    确立依靠工人群众管好企业的思想
    【本报讯】据长江日报消息：中共郑州铁路党委会汉口分党委于八月十七日至二十五日举行第一次党代表会议，根据整风精神，总结检查一年来的工作。会议在中共中央中南局、中共武汉市委及郑州铁路党委的直接帮助下进行。中共中央中南局第三书记邓子恢同志并亲临指示依靠工人群众管理企业等问题。
    大会总结了一年来在接管、恢复交通和恢复生产上的巨大成绩后，着重分析研究目前工人生产情绪低落，和生产停滞甚至部分下降的原因。大会指出基本问题是在于分党委缺乏依靠工人群众管好企业的思想，和缺乏具体明确的工作方针、路线与统一集中的组织领导。关于缺乏依靠人民群众的思想方面，大会批判了严重的农村观点。由于存在着这种错误观点，认为过去是依靠农民打天下，不是依靠工人打天下，就看不起工人。对工人群众是国家的领导阶级，及其在国家建设中的作用，都无法来认识。相反的，还错误地认为汉口工人是“两面派”，过去日本在时也做工，蒋介石来时也做工，因此得出了“汉口工人落后”的错误结论。也就产生了不关心工人生活和情绪，不能全心全意为工人服务的忘本行为。为了完成任务，采取强迫命令包办代替的官僚主义作风，有的干部还认为“不带点强迫命令就完不成任务”。工人有意见时，认为是觉悟不高，不老实；工人提出了困难不解决，还认为工人强调困难。甚至随便怀疑工人是特务，因而发生了扣押工人的严重错误，对于工人的生活福利，也漠不关心。郑州区统一调整工薪，汉口地区虽然降低了，工人为照顾全局，求得工资平衡，一般的愉快接受了，但领导上对工人生活所遇到的实际困难，估计不足，关心不够，对铁道部决定“医药收费”的问题，行政和工会没有很好向工人进行解释和动员，使工人觉得“国民党与日本人都不收费，共产党来了家属吃药也要钱，家属坐交通车、用水用电、住房子都要钱”。甚至说：“工会是税务局，只和行政一起向工人要钱”。在六、七月间，工资平均降低了百分之十一，同时取消了五种职工福利，因此工人非常不满，生产情绪受到严重影响，生产停滞甚至下降。如江岸工厂五、六月份大修机车出厂十一台，七、八两月份只出厂四台。
    分党委检讨了上述问题以后，工会、行政方面的负责同志也分别作了工作检讨。到会干部一致认识了脱离工人群众的官僚主义作风必须纠正，依靠工人群众管好企业的思想必须确立起来，并认识了过去互相埋怨和往上推的不负责态度都是不对的，必须努力学习，端正政策，彻底转变作风才能做好工作。
    汉口分局当前的工作重点是：完成生产上的工务工程的修整，模范机车队运动的开展，财务、材料制度的整理等三大任务。为了完成这些任务，大会确定必须加强党的领导，依靠工会发动群众，实行民主管理，搞好员工生活福利，做好保卫工作，培养与提拔本地工人职员干部。同时必须贯彻整风的精神，树立完整的生产观点和群众观点，纠正和克服工作中的官僚主义和命令主义作风。
