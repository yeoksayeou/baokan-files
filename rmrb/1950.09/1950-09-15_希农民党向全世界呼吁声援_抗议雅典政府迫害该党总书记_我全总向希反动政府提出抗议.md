Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: The Central Committee of the Greek Peasant Party, in response to the fascist atrocities of the reactionary Greek government in persecuting the party's General Secretary, Gavrilidis, has written to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions requesting support. The Central Committee of the party has also issued a similar appeal to the people of the world. In a letter from the Central Committee of the Greek Peasant Party to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, it stated: "British and American imperialism, in conjunction with the Greek royalist fascists, are using completely illegal means to imprison our Peasant Party's General Secretary—the heroic leader of the Greek peasants, Gavrilidis—in the terrible Makronisos concentration camp. Gavrilidis's life is now on the brink of death. We can only awaken your sympathy and concern while also requesting you to save his life." The appeal to the people of the world states: "We appeal to progressive democrats around the world, to the people and governments of all countries, and to every good citizen. We ask everyone to protest to the Athens government against its illegal imprisonment of Gavrilidis and against its inhuman treatment of Gavrilidis. We hope that in every corner of Greece, and in every corner of the world, such a cry will be heard: 'Release Gavrilidis!'"
    
Xinhua News Agency, August 8th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has lodged a protest with the Greek government regarding the atrocities perpetrated by the Greek government against Gavrilidis, the General Secretary of the country's Peasant Party. The full text of the protest is as follows:
    Prime Minister Venizelos of the Athens Government:
    This Federation strongly protests against the fascist measures taken by you and your government to persecute Gavrilidis (Bsta—gavailides), General Secretary of the Greek Peasant Party.
    Gavrilidis is an outstanding patriotic leader of the Greek peasants. Your government has resorted to violence, illegally arresting and imprisoning him for three years, and subjecting him to torture and persecution in the Makronisos concentration camp, endangering his life. We demand that your government immediately restore freedom to Gavrilidis and other patriotic elements.

Note: The Peasant Party is one of the revolutionary parties in Greece and a member of the Greek National Liberation Front. In the war for democracy and freedom, the Greek people, the Peasant Party and the working class are closely united.

    【新华社八日讯】希腊农民党中央委员会书记巴巴底米特里，为希腊反动政府迫害该党总书记加维利达斯的法西斯暴行，特写信给我国全国总工会要求声援。该党中央委员会也向全世界人民发出同样的呼吁。希腊农民党中央委员会给我国全国总工会的信中说：“英美帝国主义联合希腊保皇法西斯，用完全不合法的手段，把我们农民党的总书记——希腊农民英勇的领袖加维利达斯监禁在那可怕的马克罗尼索斯集中营里，现在加维利达斯的生命已濒于绝境，我们只有一面唤起你们的同情与关怀，一面请求你们来挽救他的生命。”在向全世界人民发出的呼吁书说：“我们向世界上进步的民主人士，各国的人民和政府和每个善良的市民发出呼吁，我们要求大家向雅典政府提出抗议，反对他对加维利达斯的不合法的监禁，反对他对加维利达斯的非人待遇。我们希望在希腊的任一角落，在全世界各国的任一角落，都发出这样的呼声：‘释放加维利达斯’。”
    【新华社八日讯】中华全国总工会为希腊政府迫害该国农民党总书记加维利达斯的暴行，特向该国政府提出抗议。抗议全文如下：雅典政府总理维尼齐诺斯：
    本会坚决抗议你和你的政府迫害希腊农民党总书记加维利达斯（Bsta—gavailides）的法西斯措施。
    加维利达斯是希腊农民杰出的爱国领袖，你的政府竟使用暴力，非法地将他逮捕监禁三年之久，并在马克罗尼索斯（makronissos）集中营中施以酷刑和迫害，致使他遭受性命的危险。我们要求你的政府立即恢复加维利达斯及其他爱国分子的自由。
    按：农民党是希腊的革命政党之一，为希腊民族解放阵线中之一分子。希腊人民在争取民主和自由的战争中，农民党与工人阶级紧密地团结一起。
