Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 2nd: Minority nationalities in various parts of Southwest China are expressing their love and support for the People's Government by actively paying agricultural tax. After the People's Government announced its agricultural tax policy and the tax quotas, a wave of tax payment movements swept through minority areas in Yunnan Province. In Yiliang, Lunan, Mile, Mengzi, Luoping and other counties, the Sani and Yi nationalities had largely completed their tax quotas within three days of the start of the collection. The Yi people living in Tuguan Village, Mengzi County, dried and winnowed the grain to be paid the day before paying the agricultural tax. The next day, they paid off the 80,000 jin of grain that was due. The Dai, Akha and other ethnic groups in the three counties of Cheli, Fo Hai and Nanqiao on the southern border of Yunnan fully demonstrated their patriotic zeal in paying grain. They completed the task of paying five million jin of public grain in two months. They all considered it most glorious to be awarded portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu for delivering good grain and protecting the granaries well. The Yishiting (Council Hall) and all the people of Xishuangbanna (including Cheli, Fohai and Nanqiao counties) also wrote a letter to the leaders of the Yunnan Military Region to express their love for the motherland. The letter said: We are determined to work hard to produce and build new counties such as Cheli, Fohai and Nanqiao to consolidate the border areas.

　　西南少数民族踊跃缴纳公粮
    【新华社重庆二日电】西南各地少数民族，以踊跃缴纳公粮表示对人民政府的热爱与拥护。云南省各地的少数民族在人民政府公布征收公粮政策和宣布公粮任务后，普遍掀起缴粮运动。宜良、路南、弥勒、蒙自、罗平等县，撒尼族、彝族的公粮任务，在开征后三日内便大部完成。居住在蒙自县土官村的彝族人民，在缴公粮的前一天就把要缴的粮食晒干、簸净。第二天就缴清应征的八万斤公粮。滇南边陲车里、佛海、南峤三县的摆彝族、阿卡族等在缴粮中充分表现了爱国的热忱，在两个月内就完成了五百万斤公粮的任务。他们均以缴好粮护好仓，获得毛主席、朱总司令画像的奖品为最光荣。十二版纳（包括车里、佛海、南峤三县）议事庭及全体人民为了表示他们对祖国的热爱，还写信向云南军区首长致敬。信上说：我们决心努力生产，建设新的车里、佛海、南峤等县，以巩固边疆。
