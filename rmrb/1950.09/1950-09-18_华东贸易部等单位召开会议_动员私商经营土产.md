The East China Trade Department and other units hold meeting to mobilize private merchants to manage native produce

[Shanghai News] According to the Liberation Daily: In order to assist private merchants in concentrating funds and organizing the purchase and sale of native products in the vast rural areas, so as to expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, the East China Trade Department, the Native Produce Company, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly invited the heads of relevant native product trade associations in Shanghai to discuss issues such as native product procurement organizations and capital turnover. On September 7th, a mobilization meeting for native product purchase was held for more than 500 representatives of Shanghai's chemical raw materials, domestic pigments, medicinal materials, seafood, northern goods, fruits, local products, pottery and other industries. The meeting mobilized all industries to organize, concentrate funds, face the countryside, and manage native products. At the meeting, Xu Dixing, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, gave a speech, stating that the government not only attaches importance to industry, but also to legitimate commerce, because it is a bridge to promote commodity circulation and connect urban and rural relations; for example, the recent actions of the transportation department to reduce freight rates and simplify procedures, and the native produce company to abolish special distributors and vigorously help private merchants to purchase in the countryside, are all clear evidence of the government's emphasis on commerce. Representatives of private merchants at the meeting also stated that they are willing to assume the glorious task of connecting urban and rural material exchanges under the leadership of the government, thoroughly transform their business policies, shift their business to transportation and sales, and concentrate their efforts on purchasing in the production areas.

After the meeting, members of various trade associations will discuss issues such as the planned management of native products, unity in business, and the improvement of native product management methods.
