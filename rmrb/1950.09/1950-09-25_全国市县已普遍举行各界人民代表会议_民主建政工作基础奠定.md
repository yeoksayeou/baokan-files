Xinhua News Agency, 20th. In the past year or so, people's representative conferences of all circles have been universally held in cities and counties across the country, and provincial people's representative conferences of all circles are also being convened one after another. According to recent statistics: 211 cities, towns, and urban areas across the country have held people's representative conferences of all circles. Of the 2,069 counties (excluding banners) in the country, more than 80 percent, or 1,707, have held people's representative conferences of all circles. Of the 40 banners in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 22 banners, 2 leagues and 7 banners in Suiyuan, and 7 banners in the Northeast have all held league or banner people's representative conferences of all circles. The following ten provinces and two administrative regions equivalent to provinces have held provincial people's representative conferences of all circles and exercised the functions and powers of provincial people's congresses: Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, Liaodong, Jilin, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Rehe, Chahar, and Shaanxi, as well as the North Sichuan and South Jiangsu administrative regions which are equivalent to provinces. Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces have also held people's representative conferences of all circles. The Northeast region has held people's representative conferences of all circles and exercised the functions and powers of the People's Congress. In addition, most districts and villages in the Northeast, and some districts and villages in the old liberated areas of North and Northwest China, have held district and village people's representative conferences of all circles or people's congresses. District people's representative conferences of all circles in large cities such as Guangzhou, Beijing, and Tianjin have been held or are being held successively.

　　People's Representative Conferences of All Circles in Cities and Counties Generally Go Through Two Main Stages

　　People's representative conferences of all circles in cities and counties generally go through two main stages. The first stage is the first people's representative conference of all circles held shortly after liberation, when the people's power began to be established. At that time, people from all walks of life, due to being deceived by the propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries, did not fully understand the various policies of the people's government and had a certain degree of suspicion. At these meetings, the persons in charge of the people's government reported on various tasks to the representatives, explained the various policies and decrees of the government with examples, and humbly listened to the representatives' opinions and criticisms on the work. In general, they were able to initially eliminate the incorrect views and concerns of all parties about the meeting, strengthen the understanding and trust of the people from all walks of life in the government, and smoothly promote the work. In the second stage, after the cities and counties held one or two people's representative conferences of all circles, the people's representatives recognized the nature and significance of the meeting, understood the role of the meeting, and thus their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility were improved. They repeatedly discussed the work reports and work plans of the people's government, put forward the demands and suggestions of the people from all walks of life, and closely integrated the various tasks of the people's government with the interests of the people.

　　In the past year, the frequent convening of people's representative conferences of all circles has played a great role in enabling governments at all levels to successfully complete their tasks in a situation where they were unfamiliar with the business, lacked cadres, and the work was very heavy. Due to the gradual deepening and development of representative conferences in various places, the foundation of the democratic united front in various places has been expanded, the connection between the people's government and the people has been strengthened, the political consciousness and organization of the broad masses of the people has been improved, and the various tasks of the people's government have been better carried out. Facts have proved that Article 14 of the Common Program, which stipulates that "before the convocation of the local people's congresses through universal suffrage, the local people's representative conferences of all circles shall gradually exercise the functions and powers of the people's congresses," is completely correct and completely necessary.

　　Three Main Links to Successfully Convene the People's Representative Conferences of All Circles

　　Local experiences have proved that to successfully convene people's representative conferences of all circles, it is necessary to master three main links:

　　The first is preparation before the meeting. Whether the preparation before the meeting is good or not is the prerequisite for the success of the meeting. In the early stages of holding people's representative conferences of all circles, most regions focused on using forums, market gatherings and other gatherings to publicize the significance and role of the conference, and mobilized people from all walks of life to elect their own representatives. After holding one or two meetings, the main task of preparation before the meeting is to re-elect representatives and expand the basis of representatives, so that they can better represent the interests and opinions of people of all strata. At the same time, the work before the meeting is to seriously listen to the opinions of the masses of the people, investigate and study the most basic demands and ideological trends of the masses, in order to determine one or two major issues to be focused on at the meeting. In some areas, after the central issue was determined, relevant representatives were invited to consult before the meeting. The preparatory work before the meeting is done by a preparatory committee including representatives from all aspects; if a conference has been held and a consultation committee (city) or standing committee has been established, the consultation committee or standing committee is responsible for handling it. The Shenyang Municipal People's Representative Conference of All Circles held in November last year discussed the methods for handling labor-capital relations and winter relief, etc. Because the draft methods were submitted to both labor and capital for discussion as early as September, and sufficient deliberation was carried out. Therefore, everyone had a preliminary understanding of the meeting and the issues to be discussed at the meeting, and prepared their opinions to bring to the meeting. Therefore, discussions could be launched at the meeting, and the problems were truly solved. When discussing land reform in the suburbs of Taiyuan, because this link was grasped, the meeting was held very well, with little time and great results. Conversely, if the first meeting of Huachuan County in Songjiang Province was held, the final decision on what problems to solve at the meeting had not been made on the eve of the meeting, and the methods for solving the problems had not been brewed in advance, the meeting was very poorly held.

　　The second is to promote democracy at the meeting, which is the key to successfully convening the People's Representative Conference of All Circles. Wherever the representatives speak enthusiastically, discuss more, and develop criticism and self-criticism, the meeting is lively and effective; conversely, wherever there are too many reports, too little discussion, and suppression of criticism and self-criticism, the meeting is lifeless and has little harvest. The lack of democratic atmosphere at the meeting is generally caused by two situations: one is that some working cadres of the people's government are not good at listening to the opinions of the masses, and some are even afraid of the people's criticism of the government's work and the bad work style of the cadres. The other is that the working cadres are not good at analyzing the opinions of representatives of all strata and are afraid of disputes. These two tendencies have suppressed the free speech of the representatives at the meeting, making it impossible for the meeting to proceed in a normal democratic atmosphere, and making it difficult for various different opinions to reach agreement. According to local experience: as long as the policies are mastered, the situation is analyzed, and the factual basis is clarified, various different opinions can be unified. Because although the various different revolutionary classes have different interests today, they have their highest common interests. In addition, with the Common Program and the policy guidelines of the Central People's Government as the criterion, most of the divergent opinions can be combined with on-site discussion and off-site consultation, general assembly discussion and small group consultation to seek consensus. At the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, because the leading organs took the initiative to guide the masses to put forward their opinions, they found that the masses were extremely dissatisfied with the unfair burden, and immediately corrected it, solving the big problems that were pressing in the hearts of the masses, and greatly improving the relationship between the Communist Party, the people's government, and the people in the county. When discussing labor-capital relations at the People's Representative Conference of All Circles held in Shenyang in November last year, not only did the labor and capital parties put forward their own opinions, but also the representatives of other circles spoke enthusiastically. Correct opinions were supported, and incorrect opinions were criticized, so that different opinions reached a consensus on the principle of unity. Conversely, at the People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, as soon as the meeting opened, the cadres asked everyone to only talk about the difficulties of the country and not about personal difficulties, which restricted the speeches of the representatives and made it impossible for the meeting to start discussions.

　　The third is the transmission and execution of resolutions after the meeting. The work report and various resolutions of the meeting must be transmitted to the people of all circles through the representatives after the meeting. Local experiences have proved that wherever various forms are widely and deeply used for transmission and explanation, and everyone is mobilized to cooperate with the people's governments at all levels and their subordinate departments to jointly implement the resolutions, the resolutions of the meeting become the actions of the masses. The People's Representative Conference of All Circles in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, combined with the central work of the county, made three resolutions: restoring and developing handicraft and sideline industries, building water conservancy projects and repairing borders and ridges, and planting trees and afforestation. After the meeting, the county government convened a meeting of district heads, and the county committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the party, all of which were transmitted and arranged for county and district cadres to go to the countryside. The county head personally went deep into the villages to provide specific guidance and help the villages overcome difficulties in their work. At the same time, the representatives also generally conveyed the resolutions and actively took the lead in promoting the work. As a result, not only did the various tasks achieve the expected results, but they also exceeded the original plan. For example, the original plan was to plant 500 mu of trees, but 3,200 mu were completed; the original plan was to dig wells and repair canals to increase paddy fields by 140 mu, but 500 mu were completed. The representatives said with emotion: The people's government is good. The government will do what we have decided. In the future, we must better connect with the masses and do a good job.

　　In Some Areas, Various Tasks Cannot Be Carried Out Well If the People's Congress Is Not Held Well

　　In the past year or so, due to the repeated instructions of the Central People's Government and the actual role of holding people's representative conferences of all circles in various places, the staff of the people's governments at all levels have had a certain understanding of the basic national power system of people's representative conferences of all circles. The people's governments at all levels in various places have been able to convene such meetings on schedule and earnestly prepare, discuss, and coordinate with the people to implement the resolutions. However, some areas have not convened or failed to convene such meetings on schedule until now, so the connection between the people's government and the people is not close enough, and various tasks cannot be carried out well. In some areas, the people's representative conferences of all circles that have been convened still have serious shortcomings of formalism and closed-doorism. The performance of formalism: some do not fully prepare before the meeting; there are many reports and few discussions at the meeting; the meeting has no central focus, and most of the resolutions cannot be implemented. They think that as long as the meeting is held, the "task" is completed. Some blindly pursue formalistic excitement and solemnity, ignoring the main purpose of the meeting. For example, a county in Songjiang Province made 103 resolutions at a people's representative conference, most of which could not be implemented; cadres in Niumaowu District, Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, adopted a perfunctory attitude towards the people's representative conference, and most of the representatives who attended were working cadres, replacing the people's representative conference with a cadre meeting. The performance of closed-doorism is: only paying attention to the purity of the representatives and intentionally or unintentionally ignoring the breadth of the representatives. During the discussion, they cannot patiently listen to the different opinions of the representatives, and use mechanical and rigid methods to suppress the development of the discussion. When Yuxi County, Yunnan Province held its first People's Representative Conference of All Circles, because there was no preparation before the meeting, there were many proposals and differences of opinion at the meeting. The responsible cadres suppressed the divergent opinions in a rigid manner. The meeting lasted for three days, but there was no result. In addition, contrary to closed-doorism, a tendency of accommodationism has also occurred in individual places. In order for the People's Representative Conference of All Circles to better play its due role, it is necessary to further and thoroughly correct these shortcomings and biases.

　　全国市县已普遍举行各界人民代表会议
    民主建政工作基础奠定
    【新华社二十日讯】一年多以来，全国各市、县已普遍地举行了各界人民代表会议，省的各界人民代表会议亦正陆续召开。根据最近的统计：全国已有二百一十一个市、镇和城关开过各界人民代表会议。全国二千零六十九个县（不包括旗）中，已有百分之八十以上即一千七百零七个开过各界人民代表会议。内蒙自治区四十个旗中的二十二个旗、绥远二个盟和七个旗、东北的七个旗，都已开过盟的或旗的各界人民代表会议。已举行省各界人民代表会议并代行省人民代表大会职权的有：山东、山西、河南、辽东、吉林、松江、黑龙江、热河、察哈尔、陕西等十省和相当于省的川北、苏南二行政区，浙江、江西和湖南三省也已举行各界人民代表会议。已举行大行政区各界人民代表会议并代行人民代表大会职权的有东北一区。此外，东北的大部分区和村、华北和西北老区的部分区和村，都已开过区、村各界人民代表会议或人民代表大会。广州和北京、天津等大城市的区各界人民代表会议，都已开过或正陆续举行。
  各市、县各界人民代表会议一般都经过了两个主要阶段
    各市、县的各界人民代表会议，一般都经过了两个主要阶段。第一个阶段是在解放之后不久，人民政权开始建立起来的情况下举行的首次各界人民代表会议。当时，各界人民因受国民党反动派的欺骗宣传，对人民政府的各项政策还不够了解，存在着某种程度的怀疑。在这些会议上，人民政府负责人向到会代表报告各项工作，以实例说明政府的各项政策法令，并虚心听取代表们对工作的意见和批评，一般都做到初步消除各方对会议的不正确看法和顾虑，加强了各界人民对政府的了解和信任，顺利地推动了工作。第二阶段，当各市、县开过一次或两次各界人民代表会议以后，各界人民代表认识了会议的性质和意义，了解了会议的作用，因而积极性和责任心提高了，对于人民政府的工作报告和工作计划，进行了反复的讨论，提出了各界人民的要求和建议，使人民政府的各项工作密切地与人民群众的利益结合起来。
    一年以来，各级人民政府之所以能够在业务不熟悉、干部缺少和工作非常繁重的情况下顺利地完成任务，各界人民代表会议的经常召开是起了很大作用的。由于各地代表会议的逐步深入和开展，各地民主统一战线的基础扩大了，人民政府与人民群众间的联系加强了，广大人民群众的政治觉悟和组织程度提高了，人民政府的各项工作更好地开展了。事实证明：共同纲领第十四条规定“在普选的地方人民代表大会召开以前，由地方各界人民代表会议逐步地代行人民代表大会的职权”，是完全正确和完全必要的。
  开好各界人民代表会议的三个主要环节
    各地经验证明：开好各界人民代表会议，要掌握好三个主要环节：
    第一是会前的准备。会前准备的好坏，是会议开好与否的前提。多数地区在初期举行各界人民代表会议时，大都着重利用座谈会、市集等集会，宣传会议的意义和作用，发动各界人民推选他们自己的代表。在开过一两次会议以后，会前的准备工作主要是改选代表和扩大代表的基础，使更能代表各阶层人民的利益和意见。会前结合这些工作同时进行的，是认真听取各界人民群众的意见，调查研究群众最基本的要求和思想动态，以确定会议要着重讨论的一两个重大问题。有的地区在中心问题确定后，并邀集有关的代表进行了会前协商。会前的准备工作，由包括有各方面代表人物的筹备委员会来做；已开过会议并成立了协商委员会（市）或常务委员会的，则由协商委员会或常务委员会负责办理。沈阳市去年十一月举行各界人民代表会议，讨论处理劳资关系的办法和冬令救济等问题，因为早在九月便把办法草案交予劳资双方讨论，进行充分酝酿。因而大家对会议和会议所要讨论的问题先有认识，并且准备好了意见带到会议上来，因此会上能够展开讨论，并真正解决了问题。太原市在讨论市郊土地改革时，也因为掌握了这个环节，会议开得很好，时间少，收效大。相反，如松江省桦川县初次举行会议时，在开会前夜还没有最后确定会议要解决什么问题，解决问题的办法也没有预先酝酿，结果会议开得很不好。
    第二是会上发扬民主，是开好各界人民代表会议的关键。凡是代表发言热烈，讨论多，展开批评与自我批评的，会议开得生动活泼，效果就大；相反，凡是报告太多，讨论少，抑制批评和自我批评的，会议就无生气、收获少。会上缺乏民主空气一般的由于两种情况产生的：一是人民政府的某些工作干部，不善于听取群众的意见，有的甚至惧怕人民群众对于政府工作和干部不良工作作风的批评。一是工作干部不善于分析各阶层代表的意见，惧怕争论。这两种倾向都抑制了会议上代表们的自由发言，使会议不能在正常的民主空气下进行，各种不同的意见难于取得一致。根据各地经验：只要掌握政策，分析情况，弄清事实根据，各种不同的意见是可以统一起来的。因为各个不同的革命阶层今天虽有不同的利益，但却有其最高的共同利益，加上有共同纲领及中央人民政府的政策方针作为准绳，多数分歧的意见，都是可以结合会上讨论与会外协商、大会讨论与小会协商，求得意见上的一致的。山西省定襄县各界人民代表会议，由于领导机关主动地引导群众提意见，发现群众负担不公平表示极大的不满，随即加以纠正，解决了群众压在心中的大问题，使该县共产党、人民政府与人民的关系有了很大的改善。沈阳市去年十一月举行的各界人民代表会议在讨论劳资关系时，不仅劳资双方提出了自己的意见，其他各界代表也热烈发言。正确的意见得到了支持，不正确的意见受到了批评，使不同的意见在团结原则上达到了一致。相反，如云南省晋宁县的各界人民代表会议一开幕，干部就叫大家只谈国家困难，不谈个人困难，限制了代表们的发言，使会议不能展开讨论。
    第三是会后的传达和执行决议。会议的工作报告及各种决议，会后必须通过代表传达到各界人民中去。各地经验证明：凡是广泛和深入地利用各种形式进行传达和说明，动员大家配合各级人民政府及其所属部门，共同来执行决议的，会议的决议就变成群众的行动。山西省陵川县各界人民代表会议与该县中心工作结合，作出了恢复与发展手工业副业、兴修水利和修边磊堎、植树造林三项决议。会后，县府召集了区长会议，中共县委会召集了党的会议，都作了传达，并布置县、区干部下乡。县长亲自深入到村具体领导，帮助各村克服工作中的困难。同时，代表们也普遍传达决议，积极带头推动工作。结果各项工作不仅收到了预期的成绩，而且都超过了原订计划。如原订植树五百亩，完成了三千二百亩；原订打井修渠增水田一百四十亩，完成了五百亩。代表们感动地说：人民政府就是好，咱们作了决议政府就办，以后更要好好地联系群众，把工作做好。
  有些地区没有开好人代会各项工作就不能很好开展
    一年多来，由于中央人民政府的再三指示和各地召开各界人民代表会议的实际作用，各级人民政府的工作人员对于各界人民代表会议这一国家基本政权制度，已有了一定的认识，各地各级人民政府已经能够按期召开这样的会议，并认真地准备、讨论和协同人民群众执行决议。但是，有些地区一直到现在还未召开或未能按期召开这种会议，因而人民政府与人民群众间的联系是不够密切的，各项工作也不能很好地开展。有些地区所召开的各界人民代表会议，还存在着严重的形式主义和关门主义的缺点。形式主义的表现：有的是会前不充分准备；会上报告多、讨论少；会议漫无中心，决议大都无法执行，以为只要开过会便算完成“任务”了。有的是一味追求形式上的热闹、隆重，忽略了会议的主要目的。如松江省一个县在一次人民代表会议上竟作了一百零三条决议，大都无法贯彻；辽东省宽甸县牛毛坞区的干部对人民代表会议采取应付态度，出席代表大都是工作干部，以干部会代替了人民代表会议。关门主义的表现为：只注意代表的纯洁性而有意或无意地忽略了代表的广泛性。在讨论时，不能耐心地倾听代表的不同意见，用机械生硬的方式抑制了讨论的展开。云南省玉溪县在举行第一次各界人民代表会议时，因会前没有准备，会上提案很多，意见分歧。负责干部即以生硬的方式压制了分歧的意见。会议开了三天，但没有结果。此外，与关门主义相反，个别地方也曾经发生过迁就主义的偏向。各界人民代表会议更好地发挥其应有的作用，有待于更进一步地彻底地纠正这些缺点和偏向。
