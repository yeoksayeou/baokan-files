　　How Can a Rural Work Cadre Learn to Manage a Factory?
　　Zhao Lan Discusses Experiences in Factory Management
　　Gu Lei
　　Like many cadres in factories, Comrade Zhao Lan, the director of a smelter, also came from a rural work background.

　　At the end of July 1949, he arrived at the Shenyang Smelter. At that time, either the generator was broken, or there was a problem with the furnace front bed. They were “fishing for three days and drying nets for two,” and often failed to complete tasks. Since he arrived, the face of the smelter has changed starting in October, and it has been able to complete or exceed its targets every month. In the first four and a half months of 1950, the semi-annual production plan for ore-produced blister copper was completed. I put forward this question to Comrade Zhao Lan: "After you transitioned from rural areas to the factory, in a completely unfamiliar environment, how did you find your way to manage the factory?" Zhao Lan shared his experiences on several key issues.

　　Humbly learn, become familiar with the production process, and grasp the key problems.

　　It was very difficult when I first walked into the factory. The set of experiences from the countryside was useless, and I was unfamiliar with new things. How to understand and familiarize myself with the production process was the first problem he encountered. At this time, he honestly read materials, talked to people, held small forums, went to the workshops to learn from everyone, and asked about the cause of every accident. He gradually learned which departments were the main keys in the entire production process, which accidents should be avoided, and which were technical errors. In response to these situations, he had focused on strengthening the work of the heart of the smelter (the smelting department) and the artery department (the power department). In the work process, whenever an accident occurred, he would convene cadres, workers, and technicians to study improvement methods and draw on collective wisdom to make everyone responsible for the factory. From every small improvement and every specific work implementation, various systems were established, responsibilities were clarified, and someone was responsible for everything. As a result, accidents were reduced. The artery department ensured the safe supply of water, electricity, and wind, and the heart department no longer stopped breathing as often as before. Comrade Zhao Lan said: "The reason for doing this in the beginning was because I didn't understand. If I didn't do this, I couldn't be considered to truly understand the factory and take the initiative in leading the work."

　　The characteristics of a factory are concentration, tension, and rapid problem solving; the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League must be unified in their steps, and the basic problem lies in clarifying the production viewpoint.

　　Because he understood the factory, at this time he also understood that the characteristics of the factory are concentration and tension, and that decisions must be made quickly and implemented immediately, otherwise it would bring huge losses to the country in a few minutes. In this environment, which was completely different from the countryside, how to quickly convey instructions and resolutions to workers and staff became the second major problem to be solved urgently. If the relationship between the administration, the Party committee, the Youth League, and the labor union in a factory is not coordinated, and they all emphasize their own business in isolation instead of focusing all their efforts on production, then the factory cannot be successful. In the past, this factory suffered from this. For this reason, under the specific help of the higher authorities, Comrade Zhao Lan proposed the slogan "Consistent thinking, unified steps, the Party, administration, labor union, and Youth League concentrate their efforts on production." With the introduction of this slogan, the work of the factory management committee was strengthened. Every important issue was discussed with the responsible comrades of the Party committee, the Youth League, and the labor union in advance, and after deliberation and discussion, a decision was made and implemented separately through various organizations. In order to help the work of the labor union, he not only provided various conveniences for the work of the labor union, often made sincere suggestions, discussed problems in a timely manner, but also took the initiative to solve workers' welfare problems. Building clinics, running canteens, health canteens, and promptly handing over the bonuses and prizes of the New Record Movement to the labor union to distribute. This not only improved the morale of the employees, but also improved the prestige of the labor union, making the work of the labor union closely centered around production tasks. The establishment of this core leadership with administration as the main body ensured that the strength was concentrated on production. When talking about this issue, Comrade Zhao Lan said: "In the factory, the basic issue of establishing core leadership and unifying the thinking and work steps of the administration, the Party committee, the labor union, and the Youth League lies in clarifying the production viewpoint."

　　A factory is not a laboratory; the factory director cannot stay focused on specialized technical learning, but must organize and utilize all technical forces.

　　In practical work, he also realized that technology will determine everything in the factory. A factory is a complex organization, and many technical difficulties arise every day. These difficulties cannot be solved by the workers' enthusiasm and correct instructions and plans alone, nor by the coordinated work of various leading departments. If the guarantee of science and technology is lost, the plans and resolutions will become empty words. From the study and improvement of many accidents, he understood that the factory cannot be a laboratory, and the factory director cannot stay focused on specialized technical learning, but should organize all technical forces and hold them in the hands of the leaders, so as to promote production and generate great power. Therefore, the factory leadership, headed by him, promoted a large number of workers and technicians with technical experience; organized technicians to go deep into the workshops, combined with workers, and jointly solved technical problems, thereby enabling technicians to enrich their technology from practical operating experience. In order to encourage inventions and creations, the leadership attached great importance to the opinions of the masses, and tried their best to support, guide, and inspire everyone to enthusiastically research and boldly and actively create. The creation of the magnesium brick furnace by the old worker Chen Lian'gao and the technician Zhao Qiming, and the success of the young technician Wang Maochuan in refining metallic bismuth, are the results of this work. Under such a boom, many technical difficulties have been solved, the advanced experience of the Soviet Union can be smoothly promoted, the conservative concept of technology has been shattered, and the factory has this achievement, it is full of vigorous vitality to move forward!

　　The central issue of democratic management is to give play to the enthusiasm of employees in formulating and implementing production plans.

　　Regarding the issue of democratization of factory management, on the one hand, they gave play to the role of the factory management committee and absorbed opinions related to production from all aspects to make the production plan more accurate; on the other hand, they considered how to implement the plan in the workshop and turn the entire plan into the workers' own plan. For this purpose, in addition to conveying the plan to the cadres and employees and mobilizing workers to discuss and formulate specific production plans through the Party, the labor union, and the Youth League, he was also able to regularly convene expanded meetings of the factory management committee (cadre meetings), employee representative meetings, and symposiums for advanced producers. Opinions and experiences from below were drawn from these meetings to check the plan itself and the problems in its implementation, and then to revise it, or put forward the next work requirements, and universally promote advanced experience. In this way, through the production plan, all the employees of the factory were organized into a whole, and everyone was able to understand the impact of their failure to complete the plan on the production of the entire factory. A sense of responsibility for completing the national plan was constantly spurring everyone.

　　一个农村工作干部如何学习管理工厂？
    赵岚谈管理工厂的体验
    顾雷
    和许多工厂里的干部一样，冶炼厂厂长赵岚同志也是由农村工作岗位上来的。
    一九四九年七月末，他到了沈阳冶炼厂。那时工厂里不是发电机坏了，就是大炉前床有毛病。“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，经常完不成任务。自他去后，打十月份起，冶炼厂的面貌就改观了，每月都能完成或超过任务。一九五○年头四个半月，完成了上半年的矿石产粗铜生产计划。我向赵岚同志提出了这样一个问题：“当你由农村转入工厂之后，在一个完全陌生的环境中，如何摸到了管理工厂的门径？”在几个关键问题上，赵岚同志谈出了他的体验。
    虚心学习，熟悉生产过程，抓住关键问题。
    刚刚走入工厂是很苦的。农村的一套经验用不上，新东西不熟悉，如何了解与熟悉生产过程，是他遇到的第一个问题。这时，他老老实实的去看材料，找人谈话，开小型座谈会，到车间去向每一个人学习，寻问每一个事故发生的原因。他逐步了解到在全部生产过程中，那些部门是主要关键，那些事故是应当避免的，那些是技术上的错误。针对着这些情况，他曾经有重点的加强了冶炼厂心脏部门（熔炼部）和动脉部门（动力部）的工作。在工作过程中，每遇到事故，就召集干部、工人、技术人员研究改进办法，集思广益，使大家对工厂都负责任。从每一个细小的改进中，每一个具体工作的实施中，建立各种制度，分清责任，使每一件事都有人负责，结果，事故减少了。动脉部门保证水、电、风的安全供应，心脏部门再也不像以前那样经常停止呼吸了。赵岚同志说：“一开始所以这样做是因为自己不懂得，不这样便不能算真正了解工厂，掌握领导工作上的主动。”
    工厂的特点是集中、紧张，迅速解决问题；党政工团要统一步调，基本问题在于明确生产观点。
    由于他了解工厂，在这时他也懂得了工厂的特点是集中、紧张，遇事要迅速决定，立即执行，否则会在几分钟内给国家带来巨大的损失。在这个与农村截然不同的环境中，如何将指示、决议迅速的贯彻到工人、职员中去，成了当时急待解决的第二个大问题。一个工厂如果行政、党委、青年团、工会的关系不协调，都孤立强调搞自己的业务，不是全力面向生产，那么工厂便不可能搞好。过去，这个厂子就吃了这个亏。为此，赵岚同志在上级的具体帮助下，提出了“思想一致，步调统一，党、行政、工会、青年团集中力量面向生产”的口号。随着这一口号的提出，加强了工厂管委会的工作，每一重要问题事先都与党委、青年团、工会负责同志商量，经过酝酿讨论，做出决定，分头通过各种组织去贯彻。为着帮助工会的工作，他不但是给工会工作以各种方便，经常提出诚恳的建议，有问题及时商量，而且能主动的去解决工人福利问题。盖医务所、办食堂、保健食堂，及时的将新纪录运动的奖金、奖品交给工会发下去。这不仅提高了职工情绪，而且也提高了工会的威信，使工会工作密切地围绕在生产任务的周围。这种以行政为主的核心领导的建立，保证了把力量集中在生产上。谈到这问题时，赵岚同志说：“在工厂中，树立核心领导，统一行政、党委、工会、青年团的思想与工作步骤的基本问题，在于明确生产观点。”
    工厂不是实验室，厂长不能停留在专门技术学习上，要组织、发挥所有的技术力量。
    在实际工作中，他同时体会到，在工厂中技术将决定一切。工厂是一个复杂的组织，每天都会产生着许多技术上的困难。这些，单靠工人的热情与正确的指示和计划，各个领导部门的工作协调还是不行的。如果失去科学技术的保证，计划和决议就会变成一纸空文。从对许多次事故的研究和改进中，他懂得了：工厂不能是实验室，厂长不能停留在专门技术学习上，而应当把所有的技术力量组织起来，掌握在领导者的手里，这样才能去推动生产，产生巨大的力量。因此，以他为首的工厂领导上，大批提拔了有技术经验的工人和技术人员；组织技术人员深入车间，与工人结合在一起，共同解决技术上的问题，从而也使得技术人员从实际操作经验中来充实他们的技术。为着鼓励发明创造，领导上非常重视群众的意见，尽力给以支持，引导和启发大家热情的研究，大胆积极的创造。老工人陈连高与技术人员赵启明创造了镁砖炉，青年技术人员王懋钏提炼金属铋的成功，都是这工作的结果。在这样一个热潮下，有许多技术上的困难解决了，苏联的先进经验也能够顺利的推广，技术上的保守观念被击碎了，工厂有了这一成就，便充满着旺盛的生命力前进！
    民主管理的中心问题是发挥职工的积极性，制订和贯彻生产计划。
    关于工厂管理民主化的问题，他们一方面是发挥工厂管委会的作用，吸收各方面有关生产的意见，使得生产计划更准确；另方面就是如何把计划贯彻到车间里去，使整个计划变成工人自己的计划。为了这个目的，他除了向干部、职工传达计划通过党、工会、青年团去发动工人讨论，订出具体的生产计划外，还能够定期召开工厂管委会扩大会（干部会）、职工代表会、先进生产者座谈会，从这些会上吸取下面的意见和经验，检查计划本身和执行中的问题，然后加以修正，或提出下一步工作要求，将先进的经验普遍的推广下去。这样通过生产计划把全厂职工组织成一个整体，大家都能了解到自己不能完成计划对全厂生产的影响，一种完成国家计划责任感时刻在鞭策每个人。
