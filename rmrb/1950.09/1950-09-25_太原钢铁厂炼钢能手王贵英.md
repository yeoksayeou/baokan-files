Wang Guiying is a steelmaking expert at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and his name is well-known in Taiyuan City. Wang Guiying is thirty-three years old this year and is a team leader on the open hearth furnace. When the workers encourage each other to work harder, they always say, "Why don't you learn from Wang Guiying?"
They are a united team, and their production results are always at the forefront.

In the past, the patching work after each tapping of steel from the open hearth furnace always took more than forty minutes, but Wang Guiying's team completed it in only a quarter of an hour. Wang Guiying accepted the guidance of Soviet comrades on the operation of hot-repairing the furnace hearth, and after careful research, he also used the shortest amount of time when tapping slag and firing the furnace hearth, and the hearth lasted longer.

In October of last year, the front wall of the No. 1 furnace had hanging bricks, and the iron plate melted about 300 millimeters. The furnace roof bricks lost their support, and the furnace roof would expand, loosen, and even collapse. At this time, the workers and cadres were at a loss. After painstaking research, Wang Guiying removed about seven or eight bricks from the furnace roof, found a piece of iron plate of the same size, welded it with an acetylene flame, and installed the bricks. As a result, the repair was successful.

After the furnace was repaired, the steel output increased. By November, the plant's new record for steel output was created. At the commendation meeting, Wang Guiying was gloriously elected as a special-class labor model. In that month, he also became a glorious Communist Party member.

After becoming a labor model, he was not arrogant at all and was even more willing to learn modestly. After becoming a Party member, he was especially good at uniting the masses. He always took the time to visit and comfort injured workers. He also tried his best to solve the difficulties of the workers. For example, worker Wu Shengguo had many family members and had financial difficulties. His wife was threatening divorce. Wang Guiying mobilized all the workers in the team to donate 200 kilograms of millet and persuaded his wife. The workers often said, "We have never seen such a good team leader!"

Understanding the Open Hearth Furnace, Caring for the Open Hearth Furnace

Comrade Wang Guiying is able to learn modestly and study diligently, so he has learned excellent steelmaking techniques on the open hearth furnace for ten years. He accurately grasps the time of smelting and can correctly judge the level of various components in the steel during casting, appropriately adding oxidizing agents and solvents, and appropriately removing slag, so that the composition of the solvents and steel slag meets the requirements and the steel ingots meet the standards.

He is familiar with the condition of the furnace, just as a physiologist is familiar with the human body. He cares for the open hearth furnace as a mother cares for her children. In December of last year, the furnace hearth was badly damaged. At that time, the quality of the magnesia bricks was not good and difficult to use. Wang Guiying came up with a good solution, breaking the magnesia bricks into pieces for substitute use to fill and fire the furnace hearth. As a result, the furnace hearth was used for a long time, saving a lot of labor and materials.

In January of this year, for several days, people said that the gas was too bad, and the gas team tried every means but could not raise the furnace temperature. Wang Guiying discovered the problem. It turned out that the gas filled the furnace, and the pressure was high, so it could not be completely burned. He immediately told the workers to open the chimney. In less than ten minutes, the furnace temperature rose, and the melting of materials was faster.

"The Open Hearth Furnace is Afraid of Wang Guiying!"

The operation of the open hearth furnace is really not a simple matter. But there is a popular saying in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant: "The open hearth furnace is afraid of Wang Guiying!" This is not without reason. Once, when repairing the tapping hole of the open hearth furnace, the first step was to remove the old residual iron and slag. Repairman Gao Dewen used oxygen to burn it and an iron rod to beat it, but he did not complete half of the work in four hours. Wang Guiying became anxious, took over and worked for a while, and quickly broke the tapping hole. Gao Dewen said, "The open hearth furnace is afraid of you!" This spread throughout the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant.

In April, Soviet experts told everyone that "cold charging" should be changed to "hot charging," that is, the iron from the iron smelting furnace should be immediately poured into the steelmaking furnace. This saves time and labor and materials, but it is not easy to do. Wang Guiying accepted the good experience of the Soviet Union and first completed this task in his team, which greatly improved production.

In August of last year, the entire plant launched the autumn competition. Wang Guiying's team took the lead in responding to the call, challenging teams A and B, and also challenging the iron smelting department! All the workers also regarded Wang Guiying as a good example and followed his example. Therefore, the competition was in full swing, and production increased more than six times compared to before liberation.

Three Wishes for Going to Beijing

Wang Guiying was elected as a representative to the National Congress of Laborers, Peasants and Soldiers. He sincerely said, "This is the glory that Chairman Mao has given me." Therefore, his three wishes for going to Beijing are: First, to see Chairman Mao and express his gratitude; second, to report on production to Chairman Mao; and third, to learn from the experience of labor models from all over the country and bring it back to the plant to further improve production.

　　太原钢铁厂炼钢能手王贵英
    太原钢铁厂通讯组
    王贵英是太原炼钢厂的炼钢能手，他的名字在太原市很响亮。王贵英今年三十三岁，是平炉上的班长。工友们鼓动人加油干活时，总说“你怎不向王贵英学习呢？”
  他们这一班团结的好，每次生产成绩总占先。
    平炉每次出钢后的填补工作，过去总需四十多分钟，王贵英这一班只用一刻钟做好了。对热修炉床的操作，王贵英接受苏联同志的指导，再经自己细心研究，每次出渣烧炼炉床时，也用的时间最短，使用的时间又长。
    去年十月间，一号炉前壁挂砖，铁板溶化约三百米厘。炉顶砖失却靠力，炉顶会膨胀松散以至倒塌下来。这时候工友干部们都束手无策。王贵英苦心研究后，把炉顶约七、八号砖拆下，找一块同样大的铁板，用乙炔焰焊接好按上砖，结果修理成功。
    炉子一修好出钢也就多了，到十一月份，就创造了该厂出钢的新纪录。在评选大会上选举模范，王贵英光荣当选为特等劳模。也就在这一月，他成了一名光荣的共产党员。
    他当了劳模，一点也不骄傲，更能虚心的学习，他成了党员，尤其善于团结群众。他对于伤患工友，总是抽工夫就探视慰问，工友有了困难他也尽力给解决。如工友武生国因为家里人口多，生活困难，老婆闹离婚，经王贵英发动全班工友捐助了二百斤小米，又说服了他女人。工友们常说：“我们从来也没有见过这样好的班长！”
  了解平炉，爱护平炉
    王贵英同志能虚心学习，苦心钻研，因此十年来在平炉上，学成了优良的炼钢技术。他对于炼的时间掌握得很准确，在铸炼中能正确地判断钢内各种成份的高低，适当的添加氧化剂和溶剂，适当的出滓，使溶剂和钢滓的成份合乎要求，使钢锭合乎标准。
    他熟悉炉子的情况，就如生理学家熟悉人的身体，他爱护平炉，一如母亲般的爱护子女。去年十二月份，炉床坏得很厉害，那时镁砖的质量不好，难以使用，王贵英想出好办法，把镁砖打碎代用，填补烧炼炉床，结果炉床使用的时间很长，省下很多工料。
    今年一月，有好几天，人们都说煤气太坏，煤气组想尽办法也没能使炉温提高。王贵英发现毛病，原来煤气充满炉子，压力大，不能完全燃烧，他马上叫工友开大烟囱，不到十分钟，炉温升起，化料也快了。
  “平炉就怕王贵英！”
    平炉操作实在不是简单的事。但太原炼钢厂流行的一句话：“平炉就怕王贵英！”这话不是无因的。有一次，修理平炉出钢口，首先要除去旧的残铁残滓，修理工高德文用氧气烧、铁棍打、四个钟头没作出一半活来，王贵英着了急，接上去一阵干，很快就把出钢口断好。高德文说了声：“平炉就怕你！”这话就传遍太原钢铁厂了。
    四月里，苏联专家告诉大家“冷装”要改成“热装”，就是炼铁炉出了铁，马上就倒在炼钢炉里。这样作省时间、又省工料，就是不大好办。王贵英接受苏联的好经验，首先在他这一班完成这一桩工作，使生产大大的提高。
    去年八月份全厂开展了秋季大竞赛，王贵英班首先响应号召，向甲、乙两班挑战，又向炼铁部挑战！全体工友也把王贵英看作一个好榜样，向他看齐，因此竞赛搞得热火朝天，生产比解放前提高了六倍多。
  到北京的三大愿望
    王贵英当选了出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议代表，他诚恳地说：“这是毛主席给我的光荣。”因此，他去北京的三大愿望是：一、见毛主席表示感激；二、向毛主席报告生产；三、向全国各地劳模学习经验，带回厂来更搞好生产。
