　　How did Liu Jianzhang Run a Cooperative?
    Lin Wei
    In his book "Economic Problems and Financial Problems" written at the end of 1942, Chairman Mao said: "In the border areas with vast land and sparse population and a dominance of small-scale peasant economy, to implement the government's economic policies and guide and encourage the people to develop the economy, we must rely on truly mass-based cooperatives to play a leverage role. Therefore, the path of the South District Cooperative is the path of the cooperative undertaking in the border area; developing the South District Cooperative movement is one of the important tasks in developing the people's economy in the border area." The leader of the South District Cooperative mentioned here was Comrade Liu Jianzhang, an old Communist Party member.
    When Chairman Mao visited Liu Jianzhang's village during the Spring Festival of 1947, he said to him: "You have done many things for the masses. You have done it right, and you should do more for the masses in the future."
    Liu Jianzhang always kept in mind the need to do more for the masses. He tried his best to do anything that could help the masses reduce difficulties and increase income, regardless of whether others or other cooperatives had done it before. When the South District Cooperative was founded in 1936, it only used a small amount of shares raised by the masses to run some consumer services, providing the people with necessities such as cloth and matches, saving the people the trouble of running around, and selling them cheaper than on the market. After 1938, their cooperative further organized the masses for transportation, production, and credit services. The production organizations included oil mills and flour mills, and after 1941, there were also textile factories (organizing women to spin), hosiery factories, and pocket factories (in addition to selling groceries, consumer businesses also included pharmacies, warehouses, and mule and horse shops). Although these production organizations were not cooperative undertakings of the producers themselves, but rather joint-stock, wage-earning enterprises, they played a significant role in absorbing rural idle funds and developing handicraft production. At the same time, they solved the employment and livelihood problems of some unemployed workers and cadres' families. At that time and in that place, it was beneficial and harmless, and met the needs. In terms of transportation, the transportation team with more than 100 animals in Goumenshang developed into the Yan'an County Transportation Brigade in 1943. With 187 personnel and 720 mules (equivalent), it became a powerful transportation force. In the same year, a credit cooperative was established in Goumenshang, with a share capital of 27 million yuan and loans of more than 300 million yuan over the years. Later, five other places, including Panlong, followed suit. When Chairman Mao summarized the characteristics of the South District Cooperative, the first point was that it "broke through the dogmatism and formalism of the cooperative and did not adhere to established rules." "Starting with consumer cooperatives; but its business has developed to all aspects of the economic life of the people in the South District."
    The cooperative led by Liu Jianzhang, on the one hand, sought benefits for the people, and on the other hand, was also a powerful institution to assist the government in completing financial and economic tasks. It closely combined the implementation of the government's financial and economic policies with the pursuit of the people's current interests. The method was to turn the burden that the people should pay to the government into shares of the masses and put it into the cooperative, and after the cooperative made profits through turnover, it would pay the burden for the masses. The contract transportation of public salt and the contract payment of public grain after 1941 were the most outstanding examples. It took the people of Yan'an a month to go back and forth to the salt ponds to transport salt and pay public grain, and they could only carry 150 kilograms. Coupled with the casualties and illnesses of the animals and the travel expenses, it was very costly and difficult to complete the transportation of 15 million kilograms of salt. At this time, the South District Cooperative converted the amount of salt to be paid to the government into a price, allowing the masses to pay money or other items to be sold to the cooperative as the shares of the masses, and the cooperative contracted the transportation. The salt was sold for profit, and the public salt was paid for the masses. The contract payment of public grain was also the same. When the mass production movement was launched in 1942, the peasants were afraid of paying more burdens if they produced more grain, and their enthusiasm was not high. The cooperative then allowed the masses to pay the same amount of public grain to the cooperative as the previous year (which could also be converted into other items), and the cooperative would be responsible for any increase in public grain in the future. If there was a decrease, the excess amount would be returned to the masses. At the same time, the public grain prepaid by the masses was regarded as the shares of the masses. In this way, the cooperative fixed the burden of the masses and improved their enthusiasm for production. Some were even willing to prepay two years of public grain. In addition, education fees, sentry station fees, prize savings bonds, etc., all adopted this method. It not only saved the government the trouble of individual charges, but also enabled the masses to increase their income in the future. In the government's organization of immigration and relief to refugees, the cooperative provided loans and lent animals to immigrants and refugees, which also played a role in implementing the policy. Regarding these practices, Chairman Mao said in his summary: "It uses the principle of mutual benefit to the public and private sectors as a bridge to connect the government and the people's economy." "It closely combines the public and private interests of the government, the cooperative, and the people, as well as the individual and collective interests." In accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, Liu Jianzhang organized various businesses such as contracted transportation of military supplies, contracted delivery of soldiers, and disaster relief after March 1947, and achieved many successes.
    In order to organize the masses' meager economic strength into a powerful economic force, they created a variety of methods. The above-mentioned expansion of the masses' share capital in undertaking specialized businesses was a widely adopted method. In addition to various production shares and burden shares, student food supply shares were also established in 1944. In order to establish a primary school, the cooperative asked each student to contribute one stone of rice per year to run an educational cooperative, and used the operating profits for all expenses of the students and the school. After three years, it was completely free. This method was later developed into a cooperative vocational high school with work-study programs. Secondly, expanding share capital in savings-related businesses. This included old-age and child-care trust shares (orphans, widows, and disabled people contribute a certain amount of share capital, and the cooperative provides food and clothing on a monthly basis), loan shares (borrowing 10,000 yuan from the credit union can be counted as 1,000 yuan of share capital), deposit shares (5% of the interest is used as share capital), prize savings and public bond shares, and gold and silver jewelry shares. Thirdly, expanding share capital in transactions. When the masses buy agricultural tools such as plows and shares from the cooperative, the part of the payment that exceeds the cooperative's purchase price is used as the buyer's share capital. Some farmers' wives borrowed a few kilograms of cotton from the cooperative when they had no money to buy cotton, and weaved cloth to sell to the cooperative. In addition to repaying the original loan, the rest was used as share capital, and they continued to take the cotton to spin. There was also a needle-selling share method: sell at market price in the first year, two-thirds in the second year, and half price in the third year. The needle price paid by the buyer in three years is used as their own share capital. After three years, each person can receive a small package of needles (25 needles, enough for a year) every year, without asking for money again. Unfortunately, in the third year, the bandits attacked, and the needles that were about to be distributed were buried and rusted.
    Because this cooperative really did things for everyone, it did not collapse after two major disasters. A major flood in 1942 washed away most of the assets, and a sharp drop in prices in 1945 caused a large amount of share withdrawal and losses, but it soon recovered its former appearance. However, after losing 94% of all assets again during the war in 1947, due to the fact that Liu Jianzhang and other experienced cadres were all working outside (some served as provincial-level cooperative leaders), the vitality has not yet recovered. But Liu Jianzhang believes that the environment and prices are now stable, and as long as someone does a good job in the future, they will definitely be able to do it again.
    Because of his long-term hard work, Liu Jianzhang is now suffering from brain disease, which is not easy to fully recover in a short time. However, he is still serving as the guidance task of the Yan'an Special District Cooperative. And made the cooperative business in the district develop from simply running consumer goods to purchasing pig bristles, fur, casings, etc., transferring them to Tianjin for export; and purchasing salt, alkali, peach and apricot kernels, etc., and transporting them south for sale. To find more ways for the people of northern Shaanxi to produce. In the past, most of these materials relied on private merchants to purchase them, and the purchase price was too small, and the farmers suffered losses, so they were unwilling to produce them. The Yan District Cooperative appropriately increased the price, and the output gradually increased. Last year, only 4,000 kilograms of rubella (medicinal materials) were collected (half of which was done by private merchants), but this year, 200,000 kilograms were collected (110,000 kilograms by private merchants). This item alone earned 300,000 kilograms of rice and exchanged it for cotton, which solved the problem of clothing for 20,000 people.
    When talking about his experience in running cooperatives, Liu Jianzhang emphasized several points. First, there must be supply and sales, and do not stick to one or several businesses. Second, have a democratic style, seek the opinions of the masses in case of trouble, do things that are beneficial to the masses, and use facts to persuade the masses. Third, there is no need to stick to the organizational form. If the supervisory committee does not play a role, there is no need to set it up forcibly. Just do a good job of the board of directors. Fourth, there must be a group of cadres and activists who are capable, understand policies, and are willing to work for the masses. If it is not enough now, we should cultivate them quickly. We must take care of the local situation when transferring cadres outward. Fifth, the state should give more care to the cooperatives, and do not let individual cooperatives suffer losses.

　　刘建章怎样办合作社？
    林韦
    毛主席在一九四二年底所著《经济问题与财政问题》一书中，有一段说：“地广人稀、小农经济占优势的边区，要贯彻政府的经济政策，组织与倡导人民发展经济，就必须依赖真正群众化的合作社起杠杆作用。因此南区合作社的道路，就是边区合作事业的道路；发展南区合作社运动，就是发展边区人民经济的重要工作之一。”这里所讲的南区合作社，其领导人就是老共产党员刘建章同志。
    一九四七年春节毛主席到刘建章的村上去时，曾经对他说：“你们为群众办了很多事情，你们办得很对，以后还应该更多的为群众办事。”
    刘建章时刻牢记在心上的，就是要更多的为群众办事。凡是能帮助群众减少困难、增加收入的事，不管别人别社办过没有，他都尽力去办。一九三六年南区合作社创始时，只是以群众凑集的少数股金办一些消费事业，供人民以布匹、火柴之类的必需品，使人民省去跑路的工夫，卖得也较市上便宜些。一九三八年以后，他们的合作社进而组织群众运输、生产、办理信用业务。生产组织，有油坊、粉坊，一九四一年以后更有纺织厂（组织妇女纺织）、织袜厂、口袋厂等（消费业务除卖杂货外，更有药社、货栈、骡马店等出现）。这些生产组织虽然还不是生产者本身的合作事业，而是合股的雇佣企业性质；但却在吸收农村游资、发展手工业生产上起过相当作用。同时解决了若干失业工人与干部家属的职业和生活问题。在当时当地是有利无害的，切合需要的。运输方面，从沟门上一百多头牲口的运输队，发展到一九四三年的延安全县运输大队。人员一百八十七人，驮骡七百二十头（折合数），成为强大的运输力量。同年在沟门上成立信用合作社，以二千七百万元的股金历年放款达三亿元以上。以后蟠龙等地也仿办五处。毛主席在总结南区合作社的特点时，第一条就是“冲破了合作社的教条主义、公式主义，不拘守成规。”“以消费合作社开始；但它的事业，却发展到南区全体人民经济生活的各方面。”
    刘建章领导的合作社，一方面为人民谋利益，一方面也是协助政府完成财政经济工作任务的有力机构。它把贯彻政府财政经济政策与谋取人民当前利益紧密结合起来。办法是把人民对政府应缴纳的负担变成群众的股金入到合作社，由合作社经过周转取得利润后，代群众出负担。一九四一年以后的包运公盐与包交公粮，是最出色的例子。延安群众分散地各自到盐池去运盐交公，来回一趟一个月，只能驮一百五十斤。加上牲口的伤亡生病与路费，运一千五百万斤盐是消耗很大又难完成的。这时，南区合作社把应交政府的盐数折成价，让群众交钱或交其他要卖的物品给合作社，作为群众的股金，由合作社包运。运来盐卖出获利，替群众交公盐。包交公粮也是如此。一九四二年开展大生产运动时，农民怕多打粮要多负担，情绪不高。合作社便让群众按上年公粮数交与合作社（也可用他物折交），将来公粮如有增加，合作社负责。如有减少，多收之数还给群众。同时将群众预交公粮即作为群众的股金。这样，合作社固定了群众的负担，使生产积极性提高了。有的并愿预交二年公粮。此外，教育费、哨站费、有奖储蓄券等，都采取了这种办法。既省去政府个别收费之烦，也使群众将来可以增加收入。政府组织移民与救济难民中，合作社贷款、借牲口给移民、难民使用，也起了贯彻政策的作用。对这些做法，毛主席在总结中说：“它以公私两利的方针，作为沟通政府与人民经济的桥梁。”“使政府、合作社及人民三者公与私的利益，个体与集体的利益，密切的结合起来。”依照毛主席指示的这一精神，刘建章在一九四七年三月以后的战争期间，曾组织包运军火、包送兵差、救灾等各种业务，获得不少成绩。
    为着把群众微薄的经济力量组织成为强大的经济力量，他们创造了多种多样的办法。上述在承办专门业务中扩大群众股金，是被广泛采用着的办法。除去各种生产入股与负担入股之外，一九四四年并创办了学生伙食供给入股。合作社为兴办一个小学，让每一学生每年入米一石，办教育合作社，以经营利润作为学生与学校一切开支之用。三年后即完全公费。这一办法，以后又发展到半工半读的合作职业中学。其次，是在储蓄性业务中扩大股金。其中包括养老扶幼信任入股（孤寡残废者入一定股金，由合作社按月供给衣食），放款入股（借信用社一万元，可顶一千元股金），存款入股（利息百分之五作股金），有奖储蓄与公债入股，金银首饰入股等。再次，是在交易中扩大股金。群众向合作社买犁、铧等农具时，将所付货款中超过合作社购入价格的部分作为买者的股金。有的农妇到合作社买棉无钱，即借给她几斤，织了布卖给社，除了偿还原借，其余作股金，并继续拿花去纺织。还有卖针入股办法：第一年按市价卖，第二年按三分之二，第三年按半价。买者三年所付针价均作为自己股金，三年后即可每人每年配针一小包（二十五根、够一年用），不再要钱。可惜到第三年正值胡匪进攻，将要配给的针埋锈了。
    因为这合作社真能给大家办事，所以经过两次大灾难都没垮。一九四二年大水冲去大部资产，一九四五年物价暴跌，大量抽股亏损，都不久就恢复旧观。但在一九四七年战争时期再次损失全部资产百分之九十四以后，因刘建章和其他有经验干部全部在外工作（有的担任了省级合作领导干部），至今元气还未恢复。但刘建章相信，现在环境与物价已稳，只要将来有人好好干，一定还会干起来的。
    刘建章因为长年地苦苦工作，现在害着脑病，一时不易全好。但他仍在担任延安专区合作社的指导任务。并使该区合作社业务由过去的单纯办消费进到收购猪鬃、皮毛、肠衣等，转天津出口；收购盐、碱、桃杏仁等向南运销。给陕北人民找出更多生产之道。从前这些物资大半赖私商收购，收价太小，农民吃亏，故多不愿生产。延区合作社适当提高价格，产量便逐渐增大。去年茹核（药材）只收四千斤（私商占一半），今年即收二十万斤（私商占十一万斤）。光这一项挣米三十万斤，换回棉花，解决了两万人的穿衣问题。
    谈到他办合作社的经验时，刘建章强调提出几点。一是有供有销，不拘泥于一种或几种业务。二是民主作风，遇事征求群众意见，办有益群众的事，用事实去说服群众。三、组织形式不必拘泥。如监事会不起作用，就不必硬设。把理事会弄好就行。四、必须有一批有能力、懂政策、肯为群众办事的干部和积极分子。现在不够，应该赶快培养。往外调干部要照顾地方情况。五、国家对合作社应该多给点照顾，不要让个别合作社吃亏。（附图片）
