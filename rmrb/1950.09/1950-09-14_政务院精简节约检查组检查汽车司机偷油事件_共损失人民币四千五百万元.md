To the Editor:
    In this streamlining and economy campaign, the State Council of the Central People's Government uncovered an incident of gasoline theft by car drivers within the organization. After education, the matter has been appropriately resolved. The discovery unfolded as follows:

    A driver stationed at the Beijing Hotel was suspended from work and transferred back to the Transportation Section by the Foreign Affairs Bureau due to improper conduct. Following patient education by leading cadres, he finally admitted that his corrupt expenses stemmed from stealing gasoline. Initially, he confessed to stealing only five gallons, then fifteen gallons, then thirty gallons, and finally admitting to stealing up to seventy gallons of gasoline. This implicated others.

    Based on the information he provided, leading cadres spoke with several young members of the Youth League among the drivers. They also confessed to the facts, revealing the amount of gasoline stolen and their motives. Subsequently, an administrative meeting of all drivers was convened, urging everyone to speak frankly, promising no punishment, no referral to the courts, and no dismissal. A heated session of criticism and self-criticism immediately unfolded. Afterwards, many voluntarily wrote reports to the leadership, detailing their gasoline theft. Some confessed to using the money from the stolen gasoline to get married or to visit prostitutes, watch plays, and drink alcohol. In the confessions of twenty individuals, it was revealed that from the beginning of the preparatory meeting of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) last year until the CPPCC's closing, they had stolen and sold 1,328 gallons of gasoline (stealing an average of one gallon of gasoline out of every five gallons consumed), all of which was purchased by private car companies. This amounts to approximately 45 million RMB. This is indeed a significant sum!

    They confessed to various methods of stealing gasoline: Skilled drivers often used techniques such as coasting with an empty car or clogging fuel lines to save gasoline (which caused significant damage to the parts). Additionally, some individuals falsely reported high consumption amounts by claiming leaking fuel lines or excessive fuel consumption by car parts. They stole and sold gasoline in the mornings or evenings when driving empty cars; sometimes they used the excuse of going to the garage to inflate tires, taking the opportunity to sell gasoline; others did not drive the cars to the garage, pre-arranging times to conduct transactions on the streets. Certain private car companies purchased the gasoline. Some even colluded with corrupt elements within the police force, conspiring to provide cover. The cause of this situation was the lack of technical knowledge among the cadres managing the vehicles, allowing drivers to exploit loopholes. However, the primary reason was the inadequate political education of the drivers by the leading cadres, preventing them from quickly reforming their thinking and lifestyle, leading to significant waste for the country. After this mass inspection campaign, many drivers and workers strengthened their awareness of protecting state property and recognized that stealing gasoline is a criminal act.

### 政务院精简节约检查组检查汽车司机偷油事件  共损失人民币四千五百万元

　　政务院精简节约检查组检查汽车司机偷油事件
    共损失人民币四千五百万元编辑同志：
    中央人民政府政务院在这次精简节约运动中，检查出该机关的汽车司机偷窃汽油的事件。并已经过教育，得到了适当的解决。发现这件事情的经过情况是这样的：
    派驻在北京饭店的一个司机，因为行为不正派，交际处曾停止了他的工作，调回交通科。经领导干部耐心教育的结果，终于使他自己说出了腐化的费用是由偷汽油而来的。最先他只承认偷五加仑，后来承认是十五加仑、三十加仑，以至最后承认偷到七十加仑油。这样就牵涉到其他人了。
    根据他所反映的材料，领导干部又找了几位司机中的青年团员谈话，他们果然也都承认这些事实，并说出了偷油的数量和动机来。于是，行政上召开了全体司机会议，号召大家有什么说什么，说出来决不处分，不送法院，亦不解雇。会上当即热烈的展开了批评与自我批评。会后并纷纷自动地写了材料，向领导上报告了偷油情况。有人并说出用偷油的钱娶了老婆，或去玩妓女、看戏喝酒。在二十个人的坦白中，仅从去年人民政协筹备会开始到人民政协闭幕时为止，即盗卖汽油一千三百二十八加仑（平均消耗五加仑汽油，他们可以偷一加仑油），均为私营汽车行所收购。折合人民币约四千五百万元。这确实是一笔不小的数目！
    他们坦白了多种多样的偷油方法：技术高明的司机时常用溜空车、塞油管等方法以节省汽油。（这对机件的损伤都很大）。另外，某些人借口油管漏油、汽车机件费油而多报消耗量。他们盗卖油的时间都在早上或晚上放空车时；有时借口到车行打气，乘机卖油；也有不将车开到车行，预先和人约定时间在街道上进行交易。收购汽油的是某些私营汽车行。有的还和警察中的不良分子勾结，串通包庇。造成这种情况的原因，是由于管理车辆的干部缺乏技术知识，使司机有空子可钻。但主要是由于领导干部平时对司机同志的政治教育太差，使他们不能很快地改造自己的思想和生活习惯，以致造成国家很大的浪费。经这次群众性的检查运动以后，不少的司机工人加强了爱护国家财产的观念，认识了偷油是一种罪恶的行为。
