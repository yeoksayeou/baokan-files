Hunan Xiangtan Renovates Chairman Mao's Former Residence
Yan'an Plans to Build Revolutionary Historical Buildings
[This newspaper dispatch] Hunan Province, Xiangtan County people plan to renovate Chairman Mao's former residence. Chairman Mao's former residence is located in Shaoshan Village, Xiangtan County. Since its liberation last August, many people from all walks of life have visited, and international friends have also continuously visited. However, the area was damaged during the Kuomintang rule and has been in disrepair for a long time. In order to express their respect and love for their leader, the people of Xiangtan plan to renovate Chairman Mao's former residence and organize special personnel to protect it. According to the specific plans of the county people's government and the Changsha Prefecture, they are preparing to open up a square next to Chairman Mao's former residence and build a new house separately, while preserving the original style of Chairman Mao's former residence. All the places where Chairman Mao grew up, lived, studied, and rested will be in accordance with the original appearance, and the furnishings will be as they were in the past, for visitors to admire. At the same time, a section of road will be built to connect with the Xiangtan-Shaoyang highway so that vehicles can reach directly. The area is surrounded by mountains and forests, with magnificent momentum and beautiful scenery. Currently, surveying and mapping are underway, and some renovation projects have already begun.
