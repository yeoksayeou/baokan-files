　　CCP Yushu County Committee Holds Agricultural Conference
    Broadly Solicits Mass Opinions, Urgently Checks Key Work
    [This News Report] During the rectification movement in Yushu County, Jilin Province, it is planned to hold four conferences successively on agriculture, commerce, burdens, and organization to examine the main problems in these key areas. Each department, in coordination with these four conferences, will focus on checking its own work. According to this plan, the county committee first convened an agricultural conference and achieved significant results.
    The agricultural conference began in mid-July and ended in mid-August. Initially, only key cadres above the county section level were included. Because these cadres were not familiar with agricultural production, although they raised major issues such as the haste in improving agricultural technology and the formalism in organization, the discussions were still rambling and could not delve deeply. In the meeting from August 1st to 5th, trainees from the county's branch secretary training class were absorbed to participate in the discussion. These comrades were directly involved in leading production work, had a deep and concrete understanding of the implementation of policies, and understood the demands and opinions of the broad masses. Therefore, during this period of discussion, they reflected a lot of information and helped the leadership discover many problems. After the 6th, the heads of various sections and bureaus in the county and the district party committee secretaries went into in-depth analysis of the situation based on the spirit of the documents, and made checks and summaries. The meeting ended on the 14th. The conference focused on checking the mass line issue in agricultural production. In promoting the use of the elevated soil-hilling plow, because these new agricultural tools were poorly made and unusable, the masses were unwilling to accept them, resulting in a widespread and serious trend of commandism. Even during the busy farming season, technical training classes were held, concentrating more than 10,000 people from different districts to learn how to use the new agricultural tools. When the masses said they were not easy to use, they were forced to "understand" in the training classes. Some masses, fearing that cadres would scold them for "not accepting new things and having conservative ideas," dragged both new and old agricultural tools to the fields. In addition, in the seed selection and fertilizer accumulation movement, the county committee was not good at leveraging the role of the People's Representative Conference and the government, and instead busied itself with convening district and village cadre meetings to deploy tasks. In the process of implementing tasks, there was a lack of inspection of policy implementation, mass perspective, and democratic style, so the haste and formalism in the work could not be corrected in time.
    The following experiences were gained from this conference:
    1. Checking work should open up the circle of leading cadres of higher-level leading organs and broadly absorb the opinions of lower-level cadres and the masses. This agricultural conference collected a large amount of information through the branch secretary training class. After the leading comrades of the meeting grasped a large amount of information, they could discover major problems by analyzing and studying deeply according to the spirit of the documents. If only the heads of various sections and bureaus in the county were concentrated, it would be difficult to discover major problems because everyone has different job responsibilities and are not closely connected with the masses.
    2. Rectification meetings should begin by checking major problems. Agricultural production is the central task of Yushu County; among agricultural production, the issue of promoting new agricultural tools caused the most complaints from the masses, so the inspection work began with the issue of promoting the use of new agricultural tools. In this way, the masses generally focused their speeches on these major issues. They said: "These new agricultural tools are not easy to use, but we are forced to use them. This is a concrete manifestation of the leadership's subjectivism and lack of mass perspective." Then they examined the haste in agricultural technology improvement, the formalism in the work of organizing mutual aid groups, etc. The problems were discussed one after another, and the meeting was always tense and unremitting.
    3. Relevant documents should be assigned for study at any time according to the needs of inspection work. In the meeting, it was found that some cadres had a vague understanding of the consistency between being responsible to the higher authorities and being responsible to the masses; at the same time, it was also found that the county committee's leadership in agricultural production failed to make good use of the mass line working method. It was then decided to study Liu Shaoqi's "On the Party" on the issue of the party's mass line and the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Leadership Methods." According to the spirit of the documents, the leadership of the county committee was further examined. At the same time, attention was paid to correcting some one-sided erroneous ideas in the discussion process at any time. For example, in order to oppose formalism, the method of using numbers to explain the situation was negated; the assignment of work tasks was negated by criticizing coercion; and the conservatism of the masses was exaggerated in opposition to haste.
    4. Each department should check its own work in connection with the inspection of the central work. Through the inspection of this agricultural conference, the Propaganda Department of the County Committee examined the propaganda of production policies, as well as the inspection of the ideological trends inside and outside the party in the implementation of production policies, thereby discovering the erroneous ideas of squeezing out individual households in the organization and increasing the burden on wealthy households by some village cadres, which were not corrected in time. Other departments also checked their own work, so that the work of each department could also be improved as a result.

### 中共榆树县委召开农业会议  广泛征集群众意见  抓紧检查主要工作

　　中共榆树县委召开农业会议
    广泛征集群众意见  抓紧检查主要工作
    【本报讯】吉林省榆树县整风运动中，计划先后召开农业、商业、负担、组织四个会议，检查这几项主要工作中的主要问题。各部门配合这四个会议，分别有重点的检查本部门的工作。根据这个计划，县委首先召开了农业会议，并取得了显著的成绩。
    农业会议于七月中旬开始，八月中旬结束。会议开始时，原只吸收县科级以上的主要干部参加。因这些干部对农业生产情况不熟悉，虽然在会议中提出了改进农业技术中的急性病，组织起来中的形式主义等主要问题，但讨论起来仍是漫无边际，深入不下去。在八月一日到五日的会议上，就吸收了全县支部书记训练班的学员参加讨论。这些同志是直接领导生产工作的，对于政策执行情况了解得比较深刻具体，同时懂得广大群众的要求与意见，因而在这段讨论中反映了很多情况，帮助领导上发现了不少问题。六日后，县里各科局长和区委书记又根据文件精神，深入分析情况，作出检查总结。会议于十四日结束。会议中集中力量检查了农业生产中的群众路线问题。在推广使用高座培土犁时，因为这些新农具粗制滥造无法使用，群众都不肯要，结果便发生了普遍而严重的强迫命令的偏向。甚至在农忙时，还开办技术训练班，分区集中了一万多人学用新农具。群众说不好使，便在训练班中硬打通思想。有的群众怕干部骂“不接受新事物，保守思想”就拉着新旧两套农具下地。此外在选种积肥运动中，县委也不善于发挥人民代表会议及政府的作用，而忙于召开区村干部会议，布置任务。在执行任务过程中，对于政策执行情况、群众观点、民主作风等方面缺乏检查，使工作中的急性病和形式主义偏向未能及时纠正。
    这次会议中体会到以下几点经验：
    一、检查工作应打开上级领导机关主要干部的圈子，而广泛地吸收下级干部及群众的意见。这次农业会议就通过了支部书记训练班搜集了大量的情况。会议的领导同志在掌握了大量情况后，根据文件精神深入分析研究，就能发现主要问题。如果单是集中县里各科、局长，由于大家工作性质不同，与群众联系不密切就很难发现主要问题。
    二、整风会议要从主要问题开始检查。农业生产是榆树县的中心工作；农业生产中又以推广新农具的问题使群众意见最多，因此检查工作就从推广使用新农具问题开始。这样群众发言一般都集中这些主要问题上。他们说：“这些新农具就不好使用，可是硬叫使用，这是领导上主观主义和没有群众观点的具体表现。”接着又检讨了农业技术改进中的急性病，组织互助组工作中的形式主义等。问题一个连着一个讨论，会议始终紧张不懈。
    三、根据检查工作的需要，随时指定学习有关文件。在会议中发现了有些干部对于向上级负责与对群众负责的一致性认识模糊；同时也检查出县委对农业生产的领导，未能很好的运用群众路线的工作方法，便决定学习刘少奇同志“论党”中的关于党的群众路线问题及“中共中央关于领导方法的决定”两个文件。根据文件精神，进一步检查了县委的领导。同时注意了随时纠正讨论过程中的一些片面的错误思想。例如为了反对形式主义便否定了用数字说明情况的方法；批评了强迫命令，便否定了布置工作任务；反对急性病就过分夸大了群众的保守性等。
    四、各部门应根据中心工作的检查，联系检查本部门的工作。通过这次农业会议的检查，县委宣传部检查了对生产政策的宣传，以及在贯彻生产政策中对党内外思想动态的检查工作，从而发现了在组织起来中排挤单干户，以及部分村干部的加重富裕户负担的错误思想，都未及时得到纠正。其他部门也都检查了自己的工作，这样使各部门的工作也可因而提高一步。
