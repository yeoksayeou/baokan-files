How to Implement the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" Among the Masses?
    Zuo Chuntai, Chief of the Statistics and Adjustment Section, Agricultural Tax Department, Ministry of Finance

    To solve the problem of farmers' burdens, first, there must be a correct burden policy. This issue has been resolved legally with the promulgation of the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas." Second, it is crucial to implement the policy among the masses so that it becomes their own policy and burden system. But how can we implement the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas" among the masses?
    I. Launch a Broad and In-Depth Propaganda Campaign
    Local people's governments at all levels, especially at the county, district, and township (village) levels, should mobilize all staff and people's organizations to go down to the countryside and conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and explanations to grain-burdened households based on the basic spirit and specific measures of the new tax law, so that the people's government's tax policies and burden methods are understood by everyone and known to every household. Facts have proven that only by correctly implementing the policy can the task be completed successfully, and only when the broad masses of farmers master the policy can they combat the rumors and sabotage of special agents and bandits.
    II. Do a Good Job in Sorting Out Land Registers and Assessing Yields
    Land survey and yield assessment are prerequisites for implementing agricultural taxes and are the main key to achieving fair and reasonable agricultural tax burdens. Experience has proven that it is easy to stipulate tax rates but difficult to implement tax laws. Without dedicating enough time and effort to do a good job in sorting out land registers and assessing yields, we cannot overcome the phenomenon of excessively light or heavy burdens. According to the experience of grain collection last year, the phenomenon of concealing land is still quite serious in the new areas, accounting for about 20% of the cultivated land in many regions. The most significant cause is that landlords conceal land, generally accounting for more than 60% of the total concealed land. Therefore, to achieve a reasonable burden, we must first launch a movement against concealing land. Secondly, the township (village) people's government should organize an agricultural tax investigation and evaluation committee, including representatives from all classes, to conduct investigations and evaluations. At the same time, appropriate consideration should be given to the regional representation of the representatives (especially for deputy village and small villages).
    The success or failure of the election of this evaluation committee is directly related to the success or failure of the investigation and evaluation work. It is necessary to fully deliberate and prepare carefully, promote democracy and produce it cautiously, so that it has broad representation and is not usurped by illegal landlords to seize leadership. The evaluation committee members must be upright, selfless, work year-round (landlords can be an exception), and enthusiastic about serving the masses. Furthermore, when necessary, under the leadership of personnel dispatched by the higher-level government, a joint survey and evaluation committee of several villages can be formed to implement joint village survey and evaluation. This is an effective method to overcome village egoism, break the wait-and-see attitude of "the south village equals the north village" and "the east end looks at the west end", and overcome "each administration does its own thing, standards are inconsistent, slick villages benefit, and honest villages suffer". At the same time, it is also the best way to realize the combination of leadership and the masses in agricultural tax investigation and evaluation.
    The assessment of yields must be realistic and based on correct standards. Excessively increasing yields is equivalent to increasing tax rates; unreasonably reducing yields is equivalent to reducing tax rates. This is the central link to reflect the policy of implementing reasonable burdens, and it must be firmly grasped.
    III. Correctly Distribute, Reasonably Reduce and Exempt, and Conscientiously Hold County, District, and Township (Village) People's Representative Conferences
    Last year's experience in grain collection proved that there are two bases and one method to make the burden distribution balanced and reasonable. The two bases are: (1) There must be reliable and systematic grain collection materials and figures that can be used as a basis. Such as population, land area, normal annual yield, disaster situation, annual harvest, land concentration and dispersion, etc. (2) There are tax policies and the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas". By calculating the burden based on reliable figures and regulations, it can be basically balanced and reasonable. However, according to the trial calculation of the Ministry of Finance of the Central Government, the average income per person in Jindian Village, Jinhua County, Zhejiang, and the Fifth Bao of Changsheng Township, Baxian County, is about 700 jin. Because the former has scattered land and more tenanted land, the result of calculating tax for each household according to the rate is that the burden of the whole village accounts for 12.05% of the total output of the village; the latter has concentrated land and more leased land. As a result of calculating tax for each household at the same progressive rate, the burden of the whole village accounts for 22.71% of the total output of the whole village. If the same grain collection task of 15% is allocated according to output, the former is insufficient, which may form an extra levy; the latter has a surplus, which may form tax evasion or embezzlement. The so-called "contradiction between policy and task" that occurred in grain collection last year was mainly due to the failure to fully grasp the situation of rented land and the characteristics of progressive tax, and the allocation of tasks according to output was largely blind. This is a point that must be paid attention to this year.
    According to the current conditions of the new areas, our investigation and research on various materials are still insufficient, and the subjective estimation is still not small. If we want to achieve balance and rationality, we need democratic discussion to make the basis reliable. This balanced and reasonable burden can be accepted and welcomed by the masses. This is the mass line in the implementation of policies. Facts have proven that holding people's representative conferences at the county, district, and township (village) levels (townships are people's representative conferences) and submitting burden policies, agricultural tax regulations, grain collection tasks, distribution plans, and disaster reduction measures to the people's representative conferences for democratic discussion, proposing opinions, making resolutions, and submitting them to people's governments at all levels for implementation is the best organizational form to implement burden policies, unite the broad masses of people to assist the government in completing grain collection tasks, and overcome bureaucracy and commandism. The key to the success or failure of the meeting lies in whether the policy, task, and actual situation of the county and village are adapted and combined. If the adaptation and combination are good and democracy is fully developed, the meeting will be successful; otherwise, it will fail. Therefore, investigation, research, and full preparation are very necessary.
    IV. Overcome Bureaucracy and Commandism, Strictly Abide by Policies, and Strengthen Ties with the Masses
    To quickly and correctly implement the new agricultural tax law among the masses, we must earnestly overcome bureaucracy and commandism. Grain collection staff and taxpayers should unanimously adhere to policies and act in accordance with regulations. Do not exceed the policy to complete the task, and at the same time, we must block loopholes and prevent concealment. On the one hand, if there are cases of inaccurate investigation and unfair evaluation, taxpayers are allowed to appeal in accordance with the law, and the people's government should promptly investigate and adjudicate in accordance with the law. On the other hand, we must be diligent in inspection, correct deviations immediately, commend the good, criticize the backward; individual lawbreakers who take the lead in manipulating or instigating others to deliberately conceal land to evade taxes and resist the payment of public grain and are found to be well-documented should be sent to the people's court for handling; but do not arbitrarily beat or punish them. We must combine people's democracy with people's rule of law, and regard the correct implementation of policies as the power to complete tasks; the ideological viewpoints that oppose people's democracy and people's rule of law, and oppose the implementation of policies and the completion of tasks are all wrong.
    V. Leading Cadres Take Responsibility, Do It Themselves, and Grasp the Main Links
    The final and most important link is: leading cadres take responsibility, do it themselves, and tightly grasp the five major links in grain collection: "ascertaining the situation, implementing policies, correctly distributing, reasonably reducing and exempting, and organizing storage." To strengthen leadership, seize the opportunity, and educate cadres to correct their shortcomings, we can mobilize the masses and complete the task. In areas where land reform is being carried out this winter, the delay in autumn grain collection will affect the timely and smooth progress of land reform. We must concentrate our efforts, unify leadership, and work tirelessly until the final completion.
    The promulgation of the agricultural tax law will make the agricultural tax in the newly liberated areas embark on a unified road from now on. In this year's summer grain collection, certain achievements have been made in implementing policies and overcoming bureaucratic and commandist work styles, which is a good start. After the first national agricultural tax law conference, the national public grain collection conference, and the launch of the rectification movement, this year's autumn grain collection will surely receive greater results.

### 怎样把“新解放区农业税暂行条例”贯彻到群众中去？

　　怎样把“新解放区农业税暂行条例”贯彻到群众中去？
    财政部农业税处统调科科长  左春台
    解决农民的负担问题，第一要有正确的负担政策，这一问题从法令上说是已经解决了，这就是“新解放区农业税暂行条例”的公布。其次，就是如何把政策贯彻到群众中去，使之成为群众自己的政策和担负制度，这是一个极为重要的关键。但是，怎样才能把“新解放区农业税暂行条例”贯彻到群众中去呢？
    一、开展一个广泛而深入的宣传运动
    各级地方人民政府，尤其是县、区、乡（村）三级，应动员全体工作人员及各人民团体，根据新税法的基本精神和具体办法，亲自下乡向公粮负担户进行广泛而深入的宣传解释，使人民政府的税收政策和负担办法人人明白，家喻户晓。事实证明：只有正确的贯彻政策才能圆满的完成任务，只有广大农民掌握了政策，才能打击特务匪徒的造谣和破坏。
    二、做好整理地籍和评订产量的工作
    勘地评产工作是贯彻、实行农业税则的先决条件，是达到农业税负担公平合理的主要关键。经验证明：规定税率易，贯彻税法难，不拿出一定的时间和力量做好整理地籍和评订产量的工作，便不能克服负担上的畸轻畸重现象。根据去年征粮的经验，新区的瞒田现象还是相当严重的，许多地区占耕地的百分之二十上下，其中最主要的是地主瞒田，一般占瞒田总数的百分之六十以上。所以要作到负担的合理，首先必须开展一个反瞒田的运动。其次乡（村）人民政府要组织包括各阶层代表在内的农业税调查评议委员会，进行调查评议；同时还要适当地照顾代表的地域性（特别对副村小庄）。
    这个评委会选举的好坏，直接关系调查评议工作的成败，必须充分酝酿做好准备，发扬民主慎重产生，使之既有广泛的代表性，又不致为不法地主篡夺领导权。评议委员必须是为人正派、大公无私、常年劳动（地主可以例外）、热心替群众办事的。再次，必要时，在上级政府派员主持下，可组几个村的联合勘查评议委员会，实行联村勘评，这是从组织上克服村本位，打破“南庄等北庄”、“东头望西头”的观望心理和克服“各自为政，标准不一，滑头村沾光，老实村吃亏”的有效方法之一，同时也是在农业税调查评议中实现领导与群众结合的最好方式。
    产量的评订必须实事求是，按着正确的标准进行，过高地提高产量等于提高税率；无故降低产量等于降低税率。这是体现政策实行合理负担的中心环节，必须切实掌握。
    三、正确分配、合理减免、认真地开好县、区、乡（村）三级各界人民代表会议
    去年的征粮经验证明：要使负担分配的平衡合理，其根据有二，其方法有一。两个根据是：（一）要有可靠的系统的足资依据的征粮材料和数字。如人口、地亩、常年应产量、灾情、年成、土地的集中和分散等。（二）便是税收政策与新解放区农业税暂行条例。根据可靠的数字和条例来计算负担，便可基本上做到平衡合理了。但根据中央财政部试算，浙江金华县金店村与巴县长生乡第五保，每人平均收入均为七百斤左右，因前者土地分散，佃耕地多，逐户依率计征的结果，全村负担占全村产量百分之十二点○五；后者土地集中，出租地多，按同样累进率逐户计征的结果，全村负担占全村产量的百分之二十二点七一。如果按产量同样分配给百分之十五的征粮任务，前者不足，可能形成额外加派；后者有余，可能形成偷漏或贪污。去年征粮发生的所谓“政策与任务矛盾”，主要就是由于未充分掌握租佃地情况和累进税的特点，按产量分配任务带有很大盲目性的缘故。这一点是今年必须加以注意的。
    按目前的新区条件，我们对于各种材料的调查研究还很不够，主观估计成份仍不在少，欲求平衡合理，就需要民主讨论，使根据可靠，这种平衡合理的负担，才能为群众所接受、所欢迎，这就是执行政策中的群众路线问题。事实证明：县、区、乡（村）三级开好各界代表会（乡为人民代表会），把负担政策、农业税条例、征粮任务、分配方案、减灾办法提交各界代表会民主讨论，提出意见作成决议，交各级人民政府执行，是贯彻负担政策，团结广大人民协助政府完成征粮任务的最好组织形式，也是克服官僚主义、命令主义思想作风的有效方法。会议成功和失败的关键就在于政策、任务与本县本村的实际情况是否相适应、相结合；适应、结合得好又充分发扬民主，会议就会开得成功，否则就会遭受失败。因此，调查研究、充分准备是十分必要的。
    四、克服官僚主义和命令主义、严守政策、加强与群众的联系
    把新农业税法迅速而正确地贯彻到群众中去，必须确实克服官僚主义和命令主义，征粮工作人员和纳税人全体一致地做到严守政策，按条例办事。既不超越政策去完成任务，同时必须堵塞偷漏、防止隐瞒。一方面有调查不实、评议不公情事，允许纳税人依法申诉，人民政府应及时调查，依法裁定。另一方面，要做到勤于检查，有偏即纠，表扬好的，批评落后的；对为首操纵或唆使他人故意瞒田逃税、抗交公粮而查之有据的个别不法分子，应送人民法院处理；但不得乱打乱罚。要把人民民主与人民法治结合起来，要把正确的贯彻政策作为完成任务的力量；那种把人民民主与人民法治，把执行政策与完成任务对立起来的思想观点都是不对的。
    五、首长负责亲自动手，掌握主要环节
    最后和最重要的一环是：首长负责，亲自动手，紧紧掌握征粮中“弄准情况、执行政策、正确分配、合理减免、组织入仓”五大环节。要加强领导，抓紧时机，教育干部改正缺点，才能发动群众，完成任务。在今冬进行土改的地区，秋征的拖拉将影响土地改革的按时顺利进行，尤须集中力量，统一领导，不懈不怠地直至最后完成。
    农业税法的颁布，将使新解放区农业税从此步入统一的道路。在今年夏征中，在贯彻政策克服官僚主义、命令主义的工作作风方面，已作出了一定的成绩，是一个良好的开端。经过全国首届农业税法会议、全国公粮征收会议和开展整风，今年秋征定将收到更大的成效。
