　　Wuhan Yangtze Daily Criticizes Lessons from the Wuhan Chemical Plant Incident
    Lin Wei
    The Wuhan Yangtze Daily published a news item on May 28th, reporting that the publicly-owned Wuhan Chemical Plant, due to blind production, disconnection between production and sales, poor management, poor product quality, and increased costs, suffered from sluggish sales and frozen capital, resulting in the complete shutdown of its soap, oil, and glass departments. Simultaneously, it published a short commentary, reviewing the lessons of the chemical plant's shutdown. On the day the news was published, Song Mengming, Director of the Municipal Industry Bureau, immediately called the reporter for a face-to-face meeting. When Dai Feng, the reporter who covered the story, arrived, Fu Ziying, Director of the Publicly-Owned Enterprises Division of the bureau, criticized, saying: "Such criticism of the shutdown is announcing the collapse of the chemical plant, damaging the prestige of publicly-owned enterprises, and indirectly raising the status of private enterprises. This is a principled error." He demanded that the newspaper make a correction and stated, "Our Municipal Party Committee and Industry Bureau have not yet reached a conclusion on the chemical plant, but you have already come to a summary and proposed lessons. This should be a lesson for you in future reporting." Song and Fu both unanimously believed that the draft was published without being reviewed by the relevant leading authorities, which was the biggest shortcoming. On June 2nd, Yang Guoqing, the manager of the chemical plant, and others went to the newspaper, saying: "Reporter Dai Feng privately and secretly held workers' forums to collect materials, without inviting the factory's Party, government, or union leaders to participate. He just happened to encounter bad elements, so the materials obtained are incorrect." In mid-June, the Yangtze Daily held a forum to clarify the facts, inviting relevant parties to participate (the Industry Bureau did not attend due to other commitments). The meeting, on the one hand, affirmed that the basic facts and basic spirit of the newspaper's report were correct (the chemical plant's work summary in April also contained the same shortcomings as those reported in the newspaper, but they believed they should only be criticized internally), and the chemical plant should make a self-criticism. On the other hand, it affirmed that the report had shortcomings, namely that it only reported the shutdown and did not report the rectification work during the shutdown period and the improvement of the workers' ideology and skills. Moreover, the factory had already resumed production ten days before the news was published (the 18th), and the product quality had also improved, which was not mentioned in the report. The newspaper should make a self-criticism in this regard. At the same time, it pointed out that the original draft not being reviewed by the relevant authorities was not an error; but the chemical plant and the Industry Bureau threatened the workers afterward, making them afraid to approach the reporter again, and attempted to incite the workers' dissatisfaction with the newspaper under the pretext that business was affected, which was an erroneous act of suppressing criticism. Finally, both parties agreed to make their own self-criticisms and publish them in the newspaper. After the meeting, the editors and reporters of the Yangtze Daily made self-criticisms, waiting for the chemical plant's self-criticism to be sent together for publication. However, after repeated urging, it had not been sent by early July. Lu Tianhong, the secretary of the enterprise's Party committee, wrote to the newspaper: "If the Enterprise Bureau does not agree, the chemical plant will not dare to send the self-criticism to the newspaper." At this point, the newspaper organized all the materials and reported them to the Central China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the CPC for processing. The Wuhan Municipal Committee convened a meeting on August 16th, passing the "Decision on Supporting the Criticism Made by the Yangtze Daily on the Wuhan Chemical Plant," and ordering Song Mengming, Director of the Industry Bureau, and Fu Ziying, Director of the bureau, to make self-criticisms for the error of resisting the newspaper's criticism. The Municipal Committee's decision, Song Mengming's self-criticism, and the Yangtze Daily's self-criticism were published together in the Yangtze Daily on August 31st. Fu Ziying's self-criticism was also published on September 1st. The incident was thus resolved satisfactorily.
    From this incident, we should draw some beneficial lessons: in order to correctly implement the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications," it is necessary to enable leaders and Party members at all levels to deeply understand that conducting criticism and self-criticism in newspapers is the best way to overcome shortcomings and errors in work and prevent or reduce damage to the people's cause. On the other hand, it is necessary to enable the editors and reporters of newspapers to recognize that open criticism and self-criticism should have a clear purpose, and that there is only one purpose, which is to overcome the major shortcomings and errors that exist in the work. Generally speaking, everyone admits this point. However, the actual results often prove that some comrades do not truly admit this point. From the perspective of the Wuhan Chemical Plant and the Industry Bureau, they clearly knew that the factory had the various shortcomings discovered by the reporter's investigation. However, they felt that these shortcomings should only be mentioned in internal summaries and should not be openly criticized. Public criticism would "damage the prestige of publicly-owned enterprises" and "affect business." However, the newspaper did not criticize before May; why did the products become unsalable to the point of having to shut down? It can be seen that what affected the business was not the criticism in the newspaper, but the shortcomings that existed in themselves, as pointed out in the newspaper. If these shortcomings can be overcome, so that product quality is improved, meets market needs, and costs are reduced, the business situation will not continue to be bad for a long time. As for the so-called "prestige" issue, the Soviet magazine *Bolshevik* (note) has a very good passage: "Those who suppress self-criticism or do not understand the meaning of self-criticism usually take restrictive and suppressive measures under the pretext of maintaining the prestige of leaders. However, it is well known that the prestige of leaders is only damaged by their own non-Party attitude towards criticism and self-criticism. If the staff does not admit their mistakes, tries to quibble over obvious facts, shirks responsibility, and suppresses criticism and self-criticism, then he will undoubtedly lose the respect of others, because everyone can see that in front of them is a coward who does not have the courage to admit his mistakes, a bad worker who is unwilling to correct his shortcomings, and a person with petty and vulgar self-esteem. On the contrary, if the staff openly admits their mistakes and resolutely fights to correct them, this can only consolidate his prestige and arouse people's respect for him. Everyone will say: This is a true Bolshevik, a courageous person, a trustworthy person, because he puts the interests of the public cause above narrow self-esteem." Conducting in-depth education to make cadres and Party members thoroughly understand this principle is an important step in eliminating resistance and launching open criticism and self-criticism. This is one aspect.
    On the Yangtze Daily side, the understanding of the purpose of criticism to promote work is not thorough enough, which can be seen from the initial draft. The reporter's original draft had already mentioned that the factory carried out rectification work during the shutdown period and achieved improvements. Why did the editor delete it when it was published? The factory had already resumed production ten days before the publication, why wasn't it explained? For general readers in publicly-owned enterprises, it is beneficial for them to accept the lessons of the chemical plant's shutdown; however, it is even more beneficial for everyone to learn from the experience of rectification and improvement! For the chemical plant itself, what was more urgent and more important at that time was to recognize what problems still existed after the rectification, rather than what problems had existed before the rectification. Because they have generally recognized the past problems through their own summary. If the rectification part in the original draft was not specific enough or not correct enough, it was a matter of further interviewing, supplementing, and revising, and should not be deleted in one stroke. The result of the deletion is that the guiding role of this report for current work is greatly weakened. Those who are criticized can only find here the shortcomings that they have already discovered, and cannot find the new help they urgently need. In terms of the authenticity of the report, such a report only has one-sided authenticity, the authenticity of the past, and the authenticity of the present is not written into it. To make the criticism in the newspaper play its due role, this one-sidedness must be overcome. Such a report will make readers feel that the chemical plant is still so bad.
    It was correct for the Wuhan Municipal Committee to support the criticism of the Yangtze Daily, because this criticism is basically helpful in urging the improvement of work. However, the comrades of the Yangtze Daily must not therefore ignore the shortcomings of this report. We should earnestly overcome these shortcomings, so that the criticism in the newspaper is more in line with the Party Central Committee's requirements for us and more effectively plays its role in promoting work. This shortcoming not only exists in the Yangtze Daily, but also exists more or less in many other newspapers, including this newspaper. Therefore, everyone should pay attention to it and work together to overcome it.

### 武汉长江日报批评武汉化工厂事件的教训

　　武汉长江日报批评武汉化工厂事件的教训
    林韦
    武汉长江日报五月二十八日发表新闻一则，报道公营武汉化工厂由于盲目生产，产销脱节，经营不善，产品质量不好，成本加高，因而销路滞塞，资金冻结，致使所属肥皂、机油、玻璃三部先后全部停工。同时发表短评一则，评述化工厂停工教训。消息发表之日，市工业局宋孟明局长即打电话要记者去面谈。采访这一消息的记者戴枫去后，该局公营企业处处长傅子英指责说：“这样批评停工就是宣布了化工厂的垮台，打击了公营企业的威信，无形中抬高了私营企业，这是原则错误。”要报社负责更正。并称：“我们市委、工业局对化工厂还没作结论，你们倒先来做总结，提出经验教训来了。这应该是你们今后采访上的一个教训。”宋、傅并一致认为该稿未经有关领导机关审阅即行发表，这是最大缺点。六月二日，化工厂经理杨国庆等又到报社谈：“记者戴枫私自偷偷摸摸召开工人座谈会搜集材料，也不要厂内党政工负责人参加。刚巧碰上坏分子，因此所得材料不正确。”六月中旬，长江日报为弄清事实而举行座谈会，邀请有关方面参加（工业局因有事未出席）。会议一方面肯定报纸报道的基本事实与基本精神是正确的（化工厂四月份工作总结中，也有与报纸所载完全相同的缺点，但他们认为只应在内部批评），化工厂方面应做检讨；另一方面，肯定报道有缺点，即只报道了停工，而未报道停工期间的整顿工作及职工在思想上业务上的提高。且这一消息发表前十日（十八日）该厂已经复工，产品质量也有了改进，而报道中未曾提及。这方面报纸应作检讨。同时指出：原稿未经有关机关审查，并非错误；而化工厂和工业局在事后威胁工人，使工人不敢再接近记者，并借口营业受到影响，企图挑起工人对报纸的不满，则是一种压制批评的错误行为。最后双方同意各自检讨，在报纸上公布。会后，长江日报的编辑记者都做了检讨，只等化工厂检讨送来时一同发表。但经一再催促，直到七月初旬尚未送到。企业党委陆天虹给报社的信说：“如果企业局不同意，化工厂不敢将检讨投寄报社。”至此，报社乃将全部材料整理，报请中共中央中南局及中共武汉市委处理。武汉市委于八月十六日召开市委会议，通过《关于支持长江日报对于武汉化工厂所做批评的决定》，并责成工业局宋孟明局长与该局傅子英处长检讨抵抗报纸批评的错误。市委的决定与宋孟明的检讨，长江日报的检讨，一同在八月三十一日长江日报发表。傅子英的检讨亦于九月一日发表。事件至此圆满解决。
    从这次事件中，我们应该吸取一些有益的教训：就是为了正确地贯彻执行党中央《关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定》，必须使各级领导干部和党员都能深刻认识：在报纸上进行批评与自我批评，是克服工作中的缺点与错误，使人民事业不受或少受损害的最好方法。另一方面，必须使报纸的编辑和采访人员认识：公开地进行批评与自我批评时应该有明确的目的性，这目的只有一个，就是克服工作中现存的主要缺点与错误。一般地说，大家都是承认这一点的。但实际做的结果，往往证明了某些同志并不真正承认这一点。从武汉化工厂和工业局方面说，他们自己明明知道该厂存在着记者调查发现的各种缺点。但他们觉得这些缺点只能在内部总结中说，而不应公开批评。公开批评会“打击公营企业的威信”，使“营业受到影响”。但是，五月份以前报纸并未批评；为什么产品也会滞销到不得不停工的程度呢？可见使营业受到影响的并不是报纸上的批评，而是自身存在着报纸上所指出的缺点。如果能克服这些缺点，使产品质量提高，合乎市场需要，成本降低，营业状况就不会长期坏下去。至于所谓“威信”问题，苏联《布尔什维克》杂志（注）有一段话讲得很好：“自我批评的抑止者或不懂自我批评意义的人，通常都借口保持领导者的威信而采取限制和抑止的办法。然而人所共知，领导者的威信之所以破坏，只能是因为他们自己对待批评与自我批评的非党的态度。假如工作人员不承认自己的错误，试图狡辩明显的事实，推卸责任，抑止批评与自我批评，那末他无疑地将失去旁人的尊敬，因为大家都可看出在他们面前是一个没有勇气承认自己错误的懦夫，是一个不愿改正自己缺点的坏工作人员，是一个有着微末的、庸俗的自尊的人。而相反地，假使工作人员公开承认自己的错误，并坚决为改正错误而斗争，这只能巩固他的威信，引起人们对他的尊敬。每个人都将说：这才是真正的布尔什维克、有勇气的人、可以信赖的人，因为他把公共事业的利益放在狭隘的自尊之上。”进行深入的教育，使干部、党员彻底明白这种道理，是消除抵抗、开展公开的批评与自我批评的重要步骤。这是一方面。
    在长江日报方面，对于批评是为了推进工作这一目的的认识是不够透彻的，这从最初发表的稿子可以看出来。记者写的原稿已经提到该厂在停工期间进行了整顿工作，取得改进，编辑在发表时为什么又删掉了呢？发表的前十日该厂已经复工，为什么不说明呢？对一般公营企业中的读者来说，要他们接受化工厂停工的教训，是有益的；但是，让大家学习整顿与改进的经验，则是更加有益的！对化工厂本身说，则当时更迫切、更重要的是认识整顿以后还存在什么问题，而不是整顿以前曾经存在过什么问题。因为他们经过自己的总结，一般地已经认识了过去的问题。如果原稿上整顿部分写得不够具体，或不够正确，则是进一步采访补充与修改的问题，而不应一笔删去。删的结果，就使这一报道对当前工作的指导作用大大减弱。被批评者只能从这里找到已经由自己发现了的缺点，而找不到他们更迫切需要的新的帮助。就报道的真实性说，这样的报道只有片面的真实，过去的真实，当前的真实则没有写进去。要使报纸上的批评发挥应有的作用，这种片面性是必须克服的。这样的报道会使读者感到化工厂至今还是那么糟。
    武汉市委支持长江日报的批评，那是正确的，因为这种批评基本上对督促工作的改进是有帮助的。但长江日报同志们却不可因此忽视这篇报道的缺点。应该认真克服这种缺点，使报纸的批评更适合于党中央对我们的要求，更有效地发挥其推进工作的作用。这种缺点不仅存在于长江日报，而且或多或少地存在于其他许多报纸，包括本报在内。所以大家都应该提起注意，共同努力来克服它。
