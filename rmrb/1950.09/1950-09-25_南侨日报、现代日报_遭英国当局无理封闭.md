　　*Nanyang Siang Pau* and *Modern Daily*
    Unreasonably Closed Down by British Authorities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 23rd] Singapore News: The British authorities in Singapore closed down the well-known overseas Chinese newspaper *Nanyang Siang Pau* in Singapore on the morning of the 21st, and detained Hong Sisi, the general manager of the newspaper, and Hu Weifu, the editor-in-chief. On the same day, the government of the Federation of Malaya also ordered the closure of the overseas Chinese newspaper *Modern Daily*, published in Penang. The unreasonable closure of *Nanyang Siang Pau* and *Modern Daily* by the British colonial government in Singapore is clearly a planned act of hostility by the British authorities towards the Chinese people.
    *Nanyang Siang Pau* was founded in November 1946, with Tan Kah Kee as the chairman. Since its publication, the newspaper has adhered to the democratic unity of overseas Chinese society, supported the motherland's liberation war, and promoted the policies of the Central People's Government, and has been valued by overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Since the British colonial government promulgated the so-called "Emergency Ordinance" in June 1948, the newspaper's editing and publishing work has been continuously subjected to interference, obstruction, and sabotage, and its staff members have been constantly subjected to arrest, imprisonment, or deportation.
    *Modern Daily* was founded in October 1936 and was a small newspaper supported by lower and middle class overseas Chinese (publishing one daily and one evening edition each), which always persisted in working under difficult material conditions. Before the Japanese fascists launched the Pacific War, the newspaper called on overseas Chinese to oppose the non-resistance policy of the Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei traitors, and called on overseas Chinese to contribute money and efforts to support the motherland's war of resistance. The newspaper's daily and evening editions and weekly magazines had a wide readership in Malaya and Thailand. During the Japanese occupation, many of the newspaper's staff members were killed. After the Japanese surrendered, the newspaper resumed publication with the support of the broad masses of overseas Chinese.

### 南侨日报、现代日报  遭英国当局无理封闭

　　南侨日报、现代日报
    遭英国当局无理封闭
    【新华社二十三日讯】新加坡讯：新加坡英国当局于二十一日晨封闭在新加坡的著名的华侨报纸《南侨日报》，并将该报总经理洪丝丝、总编辑胡伟夫拘押。同日，马来亚联邦政府亦下令封闭在槟榔屿出版的华侨报纸《现代日报》。新加坡英国殖民政府于二十一日晨宣布封闭《南侨日报》之前，曾于二十日晚派遣警探三十余名，大肆搜查《南侨日报》。英国殖民当局之无理封闭《南侨日报》及《现代日报》显然是英国当局对中国人民的有计划的敌意行为。
    按南侨日报于一九四六年十一月间创刊，董事长为陈嘉庚。该报出版以来，坚持华侨社会的民主团结，声援祖国的解放战争，宣扬中央人民政府的政策，为东南亚各地侨胞所重视。自一九四八年六月英国殖民政府颁布所谓“紧急法令”后，该报编辑发行工作，即不断遭受干涉、阻碍和破坏，工作人员不断遭受拘捕、监禁或被驱逐出境。
    现代日报于一九三六年十月间创刊，是由中下层华侨所支持的小型报纸（出日刊及晚刊各一张），始终在艰苦的物质条件下坚持工作。该报在日本法西斯发动太平洋战争以前，号召侨胞反对蒋汪卖国贼的不抵抗政策，呼吁华侨出钱出力，支援祖国抗战，该报日晚刊和周刊在马来亚和泰国有广大的读者。在日寇占领期间，该报工作人员多人被害。日寇投降后，该报即在广大侨胞的支持下复刊。
