Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 20th: Our correspondent reports: As the combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army are about to gather in the capital to receive the highest honor and respect from the motherland and the people, everyone is simultaneously reminded of those heroic martyrs who are already lying in the Yimeng Mountains, the Huaihai Plain, along the Yangtze River, and on the southeastern coast of the motherland. It is their combined efforts with all their comrades that paved the way for our victory.

　　Among the thousands of heroic martyrs, we first think of the immortal hero, Chen Jinhe, a member of the Chinese Communist Party. In the winter of 1945, during the smashing of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army's frantic attack on the Shandong Liberated Area, machine gun squad leader Chen Jinhe pulled the fuse on a thunder bomb in order to clear an enemy bunker blocking the path of attack, and perished together with the enemy. Chen Jinhe's name spread throughout the army. Whenever the battle became intense, the name of the hero Chen Jinhe summoned the soldiers to bravely and resolutely eliminate the enemy, and the soldiers shouted the slogan "Learn from Chen Jinhe!"

　　During the arduous years of smashing Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army's key offensive against the Shandong Liberated Area in the spring of 1947, platoon leader Cao Wenxuan, who was also a combat hero, a model of unity, a model Communist Party member, and a model Party newspaper correspondent, fell. He had single-handedly taken an enemy bunker with eleven hand grenades under the cover of intense artillery fire. He had defended his position, even after being wounded, amidst the Kuomintang bandit army's encirclement on all sides, allowing subsequent troops to advance smoothly. In the final battle to eliminate the Chiang bandits, he bravely rushed into the headquarters building of the Kuomintang bandit army's 72nd Division, seized the enemy's machine gun, and gloriously sacrificed himself after being seriously wounded. Platoon leader Cao Wenxuan was liberated from the Kuomintang bandit army in the Battle of Yixian in September 1945. Under the patient education of the Communist Party and the People's Army, he raised his class consciousness and increased his fiery hatred for the enemy. He often said: "The enemy is iron, we are steel; as long as we are here, there will be no enemy!" This heroic statement demonstrates the invincible spiritual power of the People's Liberation Army!

　　In the days of victory after victory, the soldiers of the Third Field Army once again won a glorious victory on the Huaihai Plain, annihilating more than 600,000 of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army's main forces. This campaign was one of the decisive campaigns in the Chinese People's Liberation War. In this victory, many martyrs shed their blood, including the blood of immortal heroes like Chen Jinhe, Zhang Shucai, and Guo Jisheng, the excellent commander of the Luoyang Battalion and a first-class people's hero of East China. Stepping on the blood of the heroic martyrs, the soldiers then carried out a earth-shattering advance, crossed the Yangtze River, liberated all of mainland East China, and bravely fought across the sea. But in the first battle to liberate the Zhoushan Islands, the Battle of Daxie Island on September 19, 1949, Lin Maocheng, the commander of the Luoyang Battalion, a famous combat hero and recipient of the First-Class People's Hero Medal of East China, shed his last drop of blood. This 26-year-old young hero fought for the people for eleven years, fought in eighty battles, was wounded twelve times, and thirty-three scars all over his body recorded his glorious war history. When he was just an ordinary soldier, he killed and wounded 1,111 enemies with his own rifle and captured 203 enemies alive. The weapons he personally captured were enough to equip two companies. And after he was promoted to commander, the weapons collectively captured by the troops under his command were enough to equip a regiment. In the summer of 1947, he attended the World Democratic Youth Congress in Prague as a youth representative of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and was praised by democratic youth from all over the world. One hero fell, and thousands of heroes rose up. The hero's comrades finally brought the ocean under their feet and liberated the Zhoushan Islands across the sea.

　　The heroic martyrs came from the working people and suffered deeply from the people's hardships. The hero Guo Jisheng was a coal miner who worked twelve hours or even more every day in the dark and deep underground, swallowing bran cakes and breathing in the foul coal dust. The hero Lin Maocheng grazed cattle and sheep for landlords from an early age and suffered the pain of being treated like an animal. Under the nurturing of the Communist Party, they became outstanding people's soldiers in the People's Liberation Army. For the cause of national independence and people's liberation, they finally selflessly dedicated their lives, thus proving that they were loyal sons of the Chinese people.

　　Today, the red flags of the Chen Jinhe Squad, the Cao Wenxuan Platoon, the Guo Jisheng Company, the Luoyang Battalion, and many new heroes are hoisted high on the southeastern coastal defense line of the motherland. These heroic flags are summoning the soldiers of the entire army and the people of the whole country to bravely advance towards Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit army and the American aggressors on the isolated islands of Taiwan and Jinmen. The soldiers of the Third Field Army recite the names of the heroic martyrs thousands of times. These names inspire them to loyally defend the independence and honor of the motherland and encourage them to continue to advance bravely and selflessly for the cause of the people!

### 三野英雄先烈不朽的英名  感召着全军继续奋勇前进

　　三野英雄先烈不朽的英名
    感召着全军继续奋勇前进
    【新华社南京二十日电】本社记者报道：当人民解放军的战斗英雄们行将齐集首都，接受祖国和人民最高的荣誉和尊敬时，每个人都同时想起了那些已经躺在沂蒙山峦、淮海平原、长江两岸和祖国东南海滨地下的英雄烈士们，正是他们和全体战友们的共同努力，为我们的胜利铺平了道路。
    在千百英雄烈士们中，我们首先想起了不朽的英雄、中国共产党党员陈金合。在一九四五年冬天粉碎蒋介石匪军向山东解放区的疯狂进攻中，机关枪班班长陈金合为了扫除进攻道路上敌人的一个碉堡，拉响了炸雷，使敌人和自己同归于尽。陈金合的名字传遍了全军。每当战斗激烈时，英雄陈金合的名字便召唤着战士们英勇而坚决地去消灭敌人，战士们响亮地喊出“学习陈金合！”的口号。
    在一九四七年春天粉碎蒋介石匪军向山东解放区重点进攻的艰苦岁月里，一身兼为战斗英雄、团结模范、中共模范党员、模范党报通讯员的曹文选排长倒下了，他曾在猛烈炮火的掩护下，单人带十一枚手榴弹夺取了敌人的一个地堡。他在蒋匪军四面封锁中，负伤后仍坚守着阵地，使后续部队顺利突进。在最后消灭蒋匪的战斗里，他又奋勇冲进蒋匪军第七十二师师部大楼，夺下了敌人机枪，在身负重伤后光荣牺牲。曹文选排长是一九四五年九月在峄县战斗中从国民党匪军中解放过来的。他在共产党和人民军队耐心的教育下，提高了阶级觉悟，增长着烈火般的对敌仇恨。他常说：“敌人是铁，我们是钢；只要有我们，就没有敌人！”英雄的这一句壮言表明了人民解放军无敌的精神力量！
    在胜利接着胜利的日子里，第三野战军的战士们在淮海平原上再一次赢得了光辉的胜利，歼灭了蒋匪军主力六十多万人。这个战役，是中国人民解放战争中具有决定意义的战役之一。在这个胜利里，许多烈士流尽了自己的血，其中有着像陈金合一样的不朽英雄张树才和华东一级人民英雄优秀的指挥员郭继胜营长的鲜血。踏着英雄烈士们的鲜血，战士们接着又进行了震撼山河的进军，横渡长江，解放华东全部大陆，并英勇地跨海作战。但就在解放舟山群岛的第一仗，一九四九年九月十九日的大榭岛战斗中，华东一级人民英雄奖章的获得者、著名战斗英雄洛阳营营长林茂成，流尽了自己的最后一滴血。这位二十六岁的青年英雄为人民战斗了十一年，作战八十次，负伤十二次，浑身三十三处伤痕记载着他光荣的战史。当他还是一个普通的战士时，他就用自己的步枪打死、打伤了一千一百一十一个敌人，还活捉了二百零三个敌人，亲手缴获的武器足够装备两个连。而当他升任指挥员以后，他所指挥的部队集体缴获的武器足够装备一个团。一九四七年夏天，他曾作为中国人民解放军的青年代表，出席布拉格世界民主青年代表大会，受到世界各国民主青年的同声赞扬。一个英雄倒下了，千百个英雄起来。英雄的战友们终于使海洋驯服在自己的脚下，跨海解放了舟山群岛。
    英雄烈士们来自劳动人民，身受了人民的深重苦难。英雄郭继胜是一个挖煤工人，在乌黑深邃的地底下，每天工作十二小时甚至更多的钟点，吞着糠饼，呼吸着恶浊的煤屑。英雄林茂成从小就替地主牧牛放羊，受尽牛马般的苦痛。在共产党的抚育下，他们在解放军里成为出色的人民战士。他们为了祖国独立与人民解放事业，终于无私地献出了自己的生命，因而证明他们自己是中国人民忠诚的儿子。
    今天，陈金合班、曹文选排、郭继胜连、洛阳营和许多新的英雄的红旗正高高地插在祖国东南海防线上。这些英雄的旗帜，正在召唤着全军战士和全国人民向台湾、金门孤岛的蒋介石残余匪军和美国侵略者勇敢进军。第三野战军的战士们千百次地背诵着英雄先烈们的名字，这些名字感召着他们忠诚地捍卫祖国的独立和荣誉，并鼓舞他们继续为人民事业忘我地奋勇前进！
