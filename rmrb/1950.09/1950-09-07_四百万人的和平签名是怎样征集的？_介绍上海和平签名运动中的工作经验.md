How were Four Million Peaceful Signatures Collected?
　　——Introducing Work Experience from the Shanghai Peace Signature Campaign
　　By our reporter Cheng Guangrui
　　Shanghai, China's largest metropolis, has seen four million, one hundred seventy-nine thousand, five hundred and one (4,179,501) of its five million residents (83.6% of the city's population) solemnly sign their names to the Stockholm Peace Appeal. Like the good people in other cities throughout China and the world, they are willing to contribute their strength to defend world peace, oppose the use of atomic weapons, and oppose wars of aggression. This huge number of signatures fully demonstrates the firm will and great strength of the people of Shanghai to defend world peace. It is a heavy blow to those warmongers who attempt to undermine peace and conspire to launch wars of aggression, especially the American imperialists who openly invade our territory of Taiwan and engage in armed interference in Korea.
　　Shanghai was a city long ruled by imperialists. Especially after the Japanese surrender, the criminal plunder by the American imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang brought unprecedented disaster to the city. In May of last year, the People's Liberation Army liberated Shanghai, eliminated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and expelled the imperialist forces, enabling the city's five million people to stand up and become masters of their own destiny. However, the American and Chiang bandits' ambitions did not die out. They used planes and bombs to sabotage the city's peaceful construction, used secret agents to disrupt the city's new social order, and used shameless blockades in an attempt to suffocate the breath of this newborn city. But all the bandits' conspiracies have failed. Over the past year, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the people of the city have bravely carried out movements against blockade, against bombing, and so on. Because these movements have been victorious, on the one hand, difficulties have been overcome, and the people have used their own will and strength to build their own city; on the other hand, through these movements, the people's awareness has been raised. The Shanghai peace signature campaign was carried out on this basis.
　　The peace signature campaign in Shanghai began in May. After the Shanghai branch of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace was established on May 1, it immediately responded to the Stockholm meeting's call for peace signatures from the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress and mobilized the people of the city to sign the peace declaration. However, at that time, sufficient time was not seized to make in-depth mobilization arrangements, and cadres at all levels failed to fully recognize that the peace signature campaign was not only a powerful weapon to combat imperialist warmongers, but also a good opportunity to carry out mass education. Some even believed that peace signatures were not in line with national conditions and lacked confidence in this work. In the early stages of this movement, because the thinking of some cadres was not clear, they did not do a good job in publicizing and mobilizing the masses to participate in the signature campaign, with the result that the movement became a mere formality and drifted along on its own. By mid-June, only over 800,000 people had signed.
　　The peace signature campaign is a very concrete task. It must be widely and deeply promoted and mobilized among the masses at all levels in order to enable everyone to understand the great significance of the peace signature and to make everyone voluntarily sign their names on the peace declaration. Therefore, the old methods of holding large meetings and organizing large parades are no longer sufficient. On June 23, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference called for a peace signature campaign week to be held nationwide from "July 1st" to "July 7th." The leading organs further clarified the great significance of the peace signature campaign, stepped up mobilization and arrangements, with the leadership of the Shanghai branch of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace as the core, convened various people's organizations and democratic parties to organize a preparatory meeting for the peace signature campaign week, and in each district, jointly with various organs and organizations, organized propaganda committees or joint meetings to unify the leadership of the work in the district, and determined the guiding principle for collecting peace signatures: "First cadres, then organized masses, and then promote to unorganized masses." Because the movement had already been launched among the organized masses before the movement week, it was decided that during this movement week, in addition to focusing on further promoting the signature campaign among the organized masses on the basis of propaganda and education, attention should also be paid to discovering and vigorously organizing activists to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and education work and collect signatures among the unorganized masses.
　　In order to first clarify the thinking of cadres, before the start of the movement week, propaganda and education work was carried out in various organs and organizations. Cadres at all levels studied Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the CPC, held international affairs symposiums, or listened to reports on the international situation, so that cadres at all levels understood that, on the one hand, due to the American imperialism openly moving towards aggression, the possibility of a third world war still existed, and on the other hand, the peace and democracy camp was growing stronger and stronger and had developed into a force capable of preventing the outbreak of a third world war. The cadres therefore recognized that the peace signature campaign was a powerful weapon for carrying out propaganda work to defend world peace.
　　In the process of the propaganda week, the staff in various departments first overcame the old and superficial shortcomings of the past propaganda work, and used various propaganda tools and various places (large and small newspapers, radio stations, cinemas, theater troupes, propaganda teams, propaganda groups, etc.) and used lively and diverse propaganda methods (reports, casual talks, cartoons, poems, quick reports, living newspapers, street propaganda, neighborhood forums, evening cool gatherings, home visits, masquerade performances, improved operas, waist drum teams, Yangko dances, storytelling, advertisements, etc.), quickly and universally in accordance with the principle of "first cadres, then organized masses, and then promote to unorganized masses," promoted step by step and went deeper at each level; so that the movement unfolded on a grand scale in every corner of the city.
　　Leaders at all levels attached great importance to and fully promoted this work, and at the same time, the staff gave full play to their high degree of initiative and creativity, so this movement achieved great success. The staff participating in this movement and the activists who constantly emerged in the movement totaled more than 61,000 people. It was precisely because of the efforts of these thousands of strong peace fighters that the organizational strength of this movement was able to remain strong and vigorous and develop forward. Factories, schools, organs, shops, and various organized mass organizations all dispatched one or several propaganda teams to go deep into neighborhoods, streets, shantytowns, and various public places to carry out propaganda. Tram and bus ticket sellers publicized and collected signatures from passengers; the gas company printed signature books on the bills that were delivered to households to collect fees; the telephone company used the time announcement station and the information desk to publicize to users; the customs used speedboats to carry out propaganda to boatmen on the river; and the staff on the ferry publicized to passengers. Major factories universally used all mass gatherings and activity places to carry out propaganda activities. The 70,000 members of the tricycle and rickshaw guilds signed their names and mobilized their families to sign their names as well. Members of the Federation of Industry and Commerce launched a three-letter chain movement, with each person mobilizing at least three relatives and friends to sign. Some churches used worship time to publicize and collect signatures from church members. Many shantytowns scattered in remote corners were also swept into the high tide of the peace signature campaign. In the Jinjia Lane shantytown in western Shanghai, there were more Jiangbei people, and the propaganda staff performed Jiangbei opera combined with propaganda to collect signatures. This type of propaganda method, which was popular with the masses, helped and promoted the progress of propaganda work. At the same time, the method of "strip by strip, block by block" arrangement was adopted. In a region, the work scope was divided, and various propaganda teams carried out propaganda work separately; this could not only make the work easy to penetrate, but also avoid repeated signatures.
　　The expansion and depth of this movement exceeded any previous movement, so its influence among the masses was also the most extensive and profound. Through this movement, the masses were universally educated politically, and the political awareness of the masses was greatly improved, so that the broad masses could further understand the imperialists' conspiracy to provoke a new war and the criminal acts of American imperialism in invading Taiwan and Korea, and thus further strengthened their confidence in defending world peace. A mother in the Hunan District, after signing her own name and signing on behalf of her three sons, wrote on the peace signature book: "We want peace, but we are not afraid of war. If the imperialists dare to launch a war, we peace-loving people will eliminate them."
　　Through these movements, organizations at all levels were strengthened and improved, and at the same time, working cadres were trained and educated, and the working method of combining shock movements with daily work was initially learned. The Family Women's Federation, in this movement, through its various work departments—production groups, welfare groups, literacy classes, etc.—carried out propaganda and mobilized the signatures of the broad unorganized masses. Many housewives also joined the Family Women's Federation after signing, so the Family Women's Federation greatly expanded its organization in this movement. In this huge mass movement, the staff further recognized the greatness of the masses' strength. They strived for the help of the masses to carry out propaganda work. Many people, after signing their own names, enthusiastically participated in the propaganda and signature collection work. Mothers signed on behalf of their sons, husbands signed on behalf of their wives, and those who could write signed on behalf of those who could not; some helped the propaganda staff persuade those who had not signed to sign, and some invited their neighbors and relatives to sign. They relied on the masses to mobilize the masses to sign, so that this movement became a movement of the masses themselves. In this movement, the staff learned from the masses in a timely manner and gathered the wisdom of the masses to create many new working methods. The masses often asked questions to the propaganda staff, and sometimes debates were launched on the questions raised by the masses, such as "Why sign?" "Will a third world war happen?" "Who launched the Korean War?"... Questions like these cannot be explained clearly in one sentence. Because some of the masses did not understand clearly, they often put forward opposing opinions and launched debates. But the more the truth is debated, the clearer it becomes, and in the end the problem will always be debated clearly. The propaganda staff absorbed experience from the debate, and when carrying out propaganda work next time, they arranged the propagandists among the masses, let him raise questions and opposing opinions, and carry out questions and answers or debates, and explain a problem in a very layered way, bit by bit, in the answers and debates, so that the masses thoroughly understood and automatically signed.
　　In this movement, hundreds and thousands of activists emerged in many organs and organizations, and many talented propagandists and agitators were discovered, laying the foundation for the propaganda work organizations in various districts in the future, and creating favorable conditions for the further development of various tasks in the future.
　　The peace signature campaign was the most extensive mass propaganda movement in Shanghai since liberation. Many experiences were gained in this movement. The main ones in these experiences are: (1) Correct leadership combined with the active efforts of the staff, boldly and deeply mobilizing the masses, trusting the masses, and educating the masses and raising the political awareness of the masses through the actions of the masses themselves, so that this movement continues to develop forward; (2) For every movement and every task, it is necessary to first clarify the thinking of cadres at all levels, so as to effectively implement the principle of "first cadres, then organized masses, and then promote to unorganized masses," so that the movement develops vigorously; (3) A broad mass movement must have a unified leadership organization, so that the movement can be carried out with leadership, planning, and steps. At the same time, attention should be paid to discovering, uniting, and organizing activists at any time, so that they can become the basic team for carrying out propaganda work. (4) Finally, it must be fully recognized that the peace signature campaign is a sharp political struggle. The peace signature campaign has given the enemy a heavy blow. Therefore, the enemy also uses various shameless methods to sabotage it. In these movements, bandit special agents have used shameless acts such as spreading rumors, spilling concentrated sulfuric acid, and writing threatening letters to sabotage the peace signature campaign. Therefore, in the movement, the enemy special agents' conspiracies should also be exposed at any time, and propaganda and education should be carried out to the masses to strengthen their determination to defend world peace.
　　More than 80% of the people in the entire city of Shanghai have signed the peace declaration. This is a huge achievement. Propaganda work to defend world peace is a long-term task. This peace signature campaign has laid a solid foundation for this work. The experience gained from the initial lack of development to the later vigorous development of this movement is worth learning by leaders of the peace signature campaign and comrades who work for this movement in various places.

　　四百万人的和平签名是怎样征集的？
　 ——介绍上海和平签名运动中的工作经验
　 本报记者  程光锐
　 上海，这个中国最大都市，五百万人口中已有四百十七万九千五百○一人（占全市百分之八十三·六）已在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上庄严地签上了自己的名字。他们和全中国，全世界其他城市的善良的人们一样，为了保卫世界和平，反对使用原子武器，反对侵略战争，愿意贡献出自己的力量。这个巨大的签名数字，充分显示了上海人民保卫世界和平的坚强意志和伟大力量。对于那些企图破坏和平、阴谋发动侵略战争的战争贩子们，特别是公开侵略我国领土台湾和武装干涉朝鲜的美国帝国主义者，是一个沉重的打击。
　 上海曾是被帝国主义者长期统治的城市，尤其是日本投降以后，美国帝国主义者和蒋介石匪帮罪恶的掠夺，使这个城市蒙受空前的灾难。去年五月，人民解放军解放了上海，消灭了蒋介石匪帮并驱逐了帝国主义的势力，使这个城市的五百万人民翻身做了主人。然而美蒋匪帮们野心未死，他们用飞机、炸弹来破坏这个城市的和平建设，用特务来扰乱这个城市的新的社会秩序，用无耻的封锁，企图窒息这个新生城市的呼吸。但是匪徒们的一切阴谋都落了空。一年来，全市人民在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，英勇地进行了反封锁、反轰炸等运动。由于这些运动获得了胜利，一方面克服了困难，人民用自己的意志和力量去建设自己的城市；一方面通过了这些运动，提高了人民的觉悟。上海和平签名运动，就是在这样的基础上进行的。
　 上海的和平签名运动是从五月份开始的。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会上海分会在五月一日成立后，立即响应世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议的和平签名号召，发动全市人民在和平宣言上签名。但当时没有抓紧时间作深入的动员布置，各级干部们也没有能充分认识到和平签名运动不仅是打击帝国主义战争贩子的有力武器，同时也是进行群众教育的良好机会。甚至有人认为和平签名不合国情，对这一工作缺乏信心。在这个运动进行的初期，因为一些干部们的思想搞不通，没有很好地去宣传和动员群众参加签名，结果竟使这个运动流于形式，形成自流，直到六月中旬，签名者才不过八十多万人。
　 和平签名运动是一件非常具体的工作，必须广泛深入各阶层向群众宣传动员，才能使每一个人了解到和平签名的伟大意义，使每一个人自愿地在和平宣言上签上自己的名字。因此，过去开大会，搞大游行等老一套的宣传方式已不够用。六月二十三日，人民政治协商会议全国委员会号召自“七一”到“七七”在全国范围内举行和平签名运动周。领导机关进一步地明确了和平签名运动的重大意义，加紧动员、布置，以中国保卫世界和平大会委员会上海分会的领导为核心，召集各人民团体、民主党派组织和平签名运动周筹备会，并在各区联合各机关、团体组织宣传委员会或联席会议，统一领导本区工作，并确定征集和平签名工作方针，“先干部、后有组织群众，进而推向无组织群众。”因为在运动周前这个运动已在有组织群众中展开，所以决定在这个运动周里，除着重在宣传教育的基础上进一步普遍地在有组织的群众中推进签名外，并注意发现和大力组织积极分子，向无组织群众进行广泛深入的宣传教育工作和征集签名。
　 为了首先搞通干部思想，在运动周开始前，各机关、团体都进行了宣传教育工作，各级干部都学习了毛主席在中共三中全会上的报告，举行了国际问题座谈会或听取关于国际形势的报告，使各级干部们明了一方面由于美帝国主义公开地走向侵略，第三次世界大战的可能性依然存在，而另一方面，和平民主阵营正日益壮大，已发展成为可能阻止爆发第三次世界大战的力量。干部们因而认识到和平签名运动是进行保卫世界和平宣传工作的有力武器。
　 在宣传周的进程中，各部门工作人员首先克服了过去宣传工作中的老一套、不深入的缺点，利用各种宣传工具和各种场所（大小报纸、广播电台、影院、剧团、宣传队、宣传小组等）并且运用生动活泼的各式各样的宣传方式（报告、漫谈、漫画、诗歌、快报、活报、街头宣传、里弄座谈、乘凉晚会、家庭访问、化装表演、改良戏、腰鼓队、秧歌舞、说书、广告等），迅速、普遍地依照“先干部，后有组织群众，进而推向无组织群众”的方针，步步推广，层层深入；使这个运动以壮阔的规模在全市内各个角落里展开。
　 各级领导充分重视并且全力推动这一工作，同时工作人员又发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，因而这一运动获得巨大的成绩。参加这次运动的工作人员与在运动中不断涌现的积极分子，共达六万一千余人，正是由于这些成千成万的坚强的和平战士的努力，这个运动的组织力量乃能始终坚强旺盛，向前发展。各工厂、学校、机关、商店，各有组织的群众团体，都出动一个或几个宣传队，深入里弄、街头、棚户区及各公共场所进行宣传。电车和公共汽车的售票员向乘客宣传，征集签名；煤气公司在挨户收费的账单上印上签名书，电话公司利用报时台和问讯处向用户进行宣传；海关利用汽艇在江上向船户进行宣传；轮渡上的工作人员向乘客进行宣传。各大工厂普遍利用一切群众集会时间和活动场所进行宣传活动。三轮车和人力车公会的七万会员自己签了名以后，并发动他们的家属也签了名。工商联合会的会员发动三封信联锁运动，一个人至少发动三个亲友签名。有些教堂利用作礼拜时间，向教友宣传，征集签名。许多散处于冷僻角落的棚户区，也卷入了和平签名运动的高潮中。沪西金家巷棚户区里江北人较多，宣传工作人员就演出江北戏结合宣传，进行征集签名。这一类的为大众所喜闻乐见的宣传方式，帮助了和推动了宣传工作的进行。同时，采取了“条条块块”布置的办法，在一个地区内，划分工作范围，各宣传队分别进行宣传工作；这不仅可使工作容易深入，而且可以避免签名重复。
　 这次运动的扩大与深入超过了以往任何的运动，因此他在群众中的影响也最广泛与深刻。通过这次运动，在政治上普遍地教育了群众，大大地提高了群众的政治觉悟，使广大群众能在这次运动中更进一步认识帝国主义企图挑拨新战争的阴谋和美帝国主义侵略台湾和朝鲜的罪恶行为，因而更加增强了保卫世界和平的信心。沪南区一个母亲在自己签了名并代她的三个儿子签了名以后，在和平签名册上写道：“我们要和平，但我们并不怕战争。假使帝国主义敢于发动战争，我们爱好和平的人就要消灭它。”
　 通过这些运动，壮大与健全了各级组织，同时也锻炼了和教育了工作干部，初步学会了突击运动与日常工作相结合的工作方法。家庭妇联在这次运动中，曾经通过它的各个工作部门——生产组、福利组、识字班等进行宣传，动员了广大的无组织群众的签名，很多的家庭妇女在签名以后，也参加了家庭妇联，因此家庭妇联在这次运动中大大地扩展了自己的组织。在这个巨大的群众运动中，工作人员更进一步认识了群众力量的伟大。他们争取群众帮助进行宣传工作，很多人在自己签了名以后，都热烈地参加了宣传和征集签名的工作，母亲代儿子签名，丈夫代妻子签名，会写字的代不会写字的签名；有的人帮助宣传工作人员说服未签名人来签名，有的人邀集他的邻居和亲友来签名。他们依靠群众发动群众签名，使这个运动成为群众自己的运动。在这次运动中，工作人员及时地向群众学习，集合了群众的智慧创造出很多新的工作方式。群众常常向宣传工作人员提出问题，有时也就群众所提出的问题展开辩论，例如“为什么签名？”“三次世界大战会不会发生？”“朝鲜战争是谁发动的？”……像这类的问题，不是一句话可以解释清楚的，由于有些群众认识不清楚，常常提出相反的意见而展开辩论。但道理愈辩愈明白，最后问题总会辩论清楚。宣传工作人员就从辩论中吸收经验，在下一次进行宣传工作时，把宣传员布置到群众中去，让他提出问题和相反的意见，进行问答或辩论，把一个问题很有层次地一点一点地在回答和辩论中解释清楚，使群众彻底了解后自动地签名。
　 在这次运动中，不少的机关和团体中涌现了成百成千的积极分子，发现了许多宣传员和鼓动员的人材，给今后各区的宣传工作组织打下了基础，创造了今后各种工作更进一步开展的有利条件。
　 和平签名运动是上海解放以来的最广泛的群众性的一次宣传运动，在这次运动中获得了不少的经验，在这些经验中主要的是：（一）正确的领导配合工作人员的积极努力，大胆地深入地发动群众，相信群众，通过群众自己的行动，来教育群众和提高群众的政治觉悟，使这一运动不断向前发展；（二）每一运动、每一工作，必须先打通各级干部的思想，从而有效地贯彻“先干部、后有组织群众，进而推向无组织群众”的方针，使运动蓬勃地发展；（三）广泛的群众性运动，必须有统一领导的组织，使运动能有领导、有计划、有步骤地进行。同时应随时注意发现、团结和组织积极分子，使他们成为进行宣传工作的基本队伍。（四）最后，必须充分认识和平签名运动是一个尖锐的政治斗争，和平签名运动给予敌人以沉重的打击，因此，敌人也施用种种无耻的方法来破坏；在这些运动中，匪特分子曾用造谣、洒浓硫酸，写恐吓信等无耻行为来破坏和平签名运动，因此，在运动中还应随时揭露敌特的阴谋，向群众进行宣传教育，以加强他们保卫世界和平的决心。
　 全上海市百分之八十以上的人民都在和平宣言上签了名，这是一个巨大的成绩，保卫世界和平的宣传工作是一个长期的工作，这次和平签名运动已给这个工作打下了坚强的基础。这次运动从初期的不甚开展到后来的蓬勃发展所获得的经验，是值得各地领导和平签名运动和为这一运动而工作的同志们学习的。
