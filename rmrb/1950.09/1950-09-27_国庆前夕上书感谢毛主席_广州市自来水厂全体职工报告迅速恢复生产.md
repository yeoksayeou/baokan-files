    Letter to Chairman Mao on the Eve of National Day
　　All Employees of Guangzhou Waterworks Report Rapid Restoration of Production
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Southern Daily News: All the employees of the Guangzhou Waterworks, taking advantage of the Guangzhou model worker representatives going to Beijing to participate in the National Congress of Worker, Farmer, and Soldier Model Representatives, specially wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting their production achievements and their work confidence, and paying their respects to Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the People's Liberation Army. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    We, all the employees of the Guangzhou Waterworks, are taking the opportunity of the labor model representatives going to Beijing to attend the National Congress of Worker, Farmer, and Soldier Model Representatives to send you this letter, expressing our highest respect to you, and reporting our production achievements to you.
    When the reactionaries fled, we protected the factory. Following that, under the leadership and education of the Party and the People's Government, we implemented democratic management, changed our work attitude, and actively carried out our production work. Last winter, we successfully completed the winter machine repair plan; this April, we overcame difficulties that we could not overcome in the past, built an underwater pipeline, transported tap water to Henan, and built the Dongshan Waterworks; this summer, we exceeded the scheduled production plan, reduced costs by 10%, increased sales volume to 42.32% of the supply volume, actual water received accounted for 98.83% of the water due to be received, and improved 20,000 feet of street pipes and expanded users. In June, we summarized our production achievements and selected 101 labor models to welcome the 29th anniversary of the birth of our working class vanguard - the Chinese Communist Party. In the process of this model selection, we have established a new work attitude and labor discipline. Comrades have put forward some rationalization proposals to improve our production situation. Now we have formulated an autumn production plan focusing on construction, and plan to implement a special responsibility system for the external engineering team.
    Respected Chairman Mao, our waterworks workers suffered the oppression and exploitation of the reactionaries in the past, and tasted all the bitterness. Today we have been liberated. We have organized our own trade union and held various welfare undertakings. We would like to express our deep gratitude and respect to you and the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army under your leadership. We feel that the work we are doing today is not enough, and we must further overcome difficulties on the production front, enthusiastically respond to your call at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, strive for a fundamental improvement in our national finance and economy, and strive to build a new Guangzhou for the people! We wish you good health.
              All employees of Guangzhou Waterworks, September 14th

    国庆前夕上书感谢毛主席
　　广州市自来水厂全体职工报告迅速恢复生产
    【本报讯】据南方日报讯：广州市自来水厂全体职工，趁广州市劳模代表赴京参加全国工、农、兵劳模代表会议之便，特写了一封信给毛主席，报告他们的生产成绩与他们的工作信心，并向毛主席、中国共产党、人民解放军致敬。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们广州市自来水厂全体职工，趁着劳动模范代表到北京出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，特地给您捎上这封信，向您表示最崇高的敬意，和向您报告我们的生产成绩。
    当反动派溃逃时，我们把工厂保护下来，跟着我们在党和人民政府的领导和教育之下，实行了民主化管理，改变了劳动态度，积极地进行我们的生产工作。去年冬季，我们胜利完成了冬季修机计划；今年四月我们克服了过去所不能克服的困难，建设了河底水管，把自来水输送到河南，并建设起东山水厂；今年夏季我们超过了预订的生产计划，降低成本百分之十，增加了售水量占供水量百分之四二·三二，实收水量占应收水量百分之九八·八三，以及改善街管二万尺和扩大用户。六月我们总结了生产成绩，选出一百零一个劳动模范来迎接我们工人阶级的先锋队——中国共产党的二十九周年诞生日。在这次选模过程中，我们已经建立起新的劳动态度和劳动纪律，同志们提出了好些合理化建议，改善了我们的生产情况。现在我们已经订出以建设为主的秋季生产计划，并打算进行外勤工程队的专责制。
    敬爱的毛主席，我们水厂工人过去遭受反动派的压迫和剥削，尝尽了辛酸，今天才得到解放。我们已经组织起自己的工会，举办了各种福利事业。我们要向您和您领导下的中国共产党、人民解放军，表示深切的感激与敬意。我们觉得今天所做的工作还不够，还须更进一步在生产战线上克服困难，热烈地响应您在三中全会的号召，为争取我们国家财经的基本好转而斗争，为建设人民的新广州而奋斗！祝您健康
              广州市自来水厂全体职工九月十四日
