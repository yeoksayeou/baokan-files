Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government have recently issued a joint directive to their respective departments concerning the cooperative purchase and processing of high-quality seed cotton in various regions this year. The directive points out: In order to achieve the task of popularizing improved cotton varieties to meet the needs of the textile industry, the purchase and processing of high-quality seed cotton in various regions this year must ensure good seed quality and good germination to gradually establish a promotion responsibility system. The directive states that there are a total of 4.2 million mu of high-quality cotton fields nationwide, and it is estimated that 140 million jin of seed cotton can be purchased, yielding 820,000 dan of cotton seeds after processing. Initial estimates suggest that next year's promotion of improved varieties, including seeds retained by cotton farmers, can reach 19 million mu. To achieve this task, seed cotton produced in high-quality seed management areas will be purchased and processed by the self-operated ginneries of the cotton production departments and high-quality seed management areas of the provincial agricultural and forestry bureaus on behalf of the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation (including the collection and processing of public cotton) in order to preserve the improved varieties. If the high-quality management areas have ginning equipment but lack purchasing power, or lack ginning equipment, the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation can purchase the seed cotton and hand it over to the self-operated ginneries of the high-quality management areas for processing, or the China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation's ginneries can collect and gin the cotton themselves (the cotton production department can assist), or entrust other local public and private ginneries to carry out the processing. However, regardless of the method used, separate collection and ginning, and seed cleaning and screening should be carried out to ensure seed purity, which will be controlled by the cotton production improvement department for promotion next year. The directive stipulates that the price of seed cotton purchased in various regions, in addition to ensuring that the government-announced cotton-grain price ratio and the principle of "better cotton, better price" are implemented, high-quality cotton in high-quality seed management areas should be purchased at a price that is 4% higher according to grade, in order to encourage farmers to separate the harvesting of good and bad cotton, willingly plant high-quality cotton, and actively send seed cotton to high-quality cotton purchasing organizations, so that high-quality seeds are not lost.

　　农业贸易两部发布指示
    合作收购良种籽棉
    分收分轧保持种子纯洁
    【新华社十三日讯】中央人民政府农业部与贸易部顷向所属发出关于今年各地良种籽棉的合作收购与加工的联合指示。指示指出：为达成普及棉花良种任务以适应纺织工业的需要，今年各地良种籽棉的收购与加工工作，必需作到种籽品质好、发芽好，以逐渐建立起推广责任制度。指示说，全国共有良种棉田四百二十万亩，预计可收购籽棉一万四千万斤，加工后可得棉籽八十二万担，初步估计明年良种推广连同棉农自留种可达一千九百万亩。为达此任务，良种管理区内生产之籽棉，均由各省农林厅棉产部门良种管理区之自营轧花厂代花纱布公司收购加工（包括公棉征收加工），以便保全良种，如良管区虽有轧花设备，而无收购力量，或无轧花设备者，可由花纱布公司收购，交良管区自营轧花厂加工，或由花纱布公司轧花厂自收自轧（棉产部门可协助），或委托其他当地公私营轧花厂进行加工；但不论何种方式，都应进行分收分轧，清籽筛籽，使种子纯洁，由棉产改进部门掌握，以备明年推广。指示规定，各地收购籽棉价格，除保证按政府公布棉粮比价优棉优价办法执行外，凡良种管理区内之良种棉花，应按等级再加价百分之四收购，以便鼓励农民好坏花分收、乐意种良棉，踊跃将籽棉送给良棉收购机构，不致使良种散失。
