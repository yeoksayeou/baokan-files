　　Golden Dragon Mountain, Hero of Factory Protection

  A pair of hands worn for twenty-nine years
    Dense, small characters, one by one, slowly being written in a notebook. Writing from one end of the paper to the other, leaving no blank spaces. Holding the pen is a large hand covered in layers of calluses, with every fingernail worn down. This hand has been worn down at the furnace, under the ship hull, for twenty-nine years. When it was still tender, it held its mother's skirt, in its hometown of Gaoyou, going together to help the landlord with short-term labor and herding cattle. At ten years old, this hand picked through coal cinders and scraps of cloth in Shanghai's garbage heaps; it also fought with bullying children scavenging garbage. At eleven years old, this hand began pulling the bellows and heating rivets at the Jiangnan Shipyard... Until now, it cuts steel plates and works as a lathe operator. This hand once received the lowest wage of two and a half jiao a day, and also led more than seven thousand unemployed workers in demanding 2.3 billion yuan in dismissal and maintenance fees from the Japanese invaders. This is a hand of diligent labor and heroic struggle with the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Shanghai working class....
    Jin Longshan was in the guesthouse writing his speech for the conference. The pen looked too small in his large hand. He smiled and said, "I don't write well; it was even worse before. I've been studying at the Party School for a few months recently, so I write a little faster." He told me that he only attended private school for eight months. But I saw that his writing was very neat and careful. He was concentrating on using another tool he was not familiar with. I told him that with such a tenacious fighting will and a spirit of diligent study, any difficulty could be overcome.
    So I asked him to talk about his leadership of the Jiangnan Shipyard's factory protection struggle before the liberation of Shanghai.
  Anti-Relocation, Anti-Evacuation, Anti-Sabotage
    When the People's Liberation Army victoriously concluded the Huaihai Campaign, crossed the Yangtze River southward, and advanced towards Nanjing and Shanghai, the puppet Navy Commander Gui Yongqing plotted to move the equipment and technicians of the nation's largest shipyard, which had a history of more than eighty years and could build ten-thousand-ton ships and manufacture airplanes, to Taiwan. After the workers recognized this conspiracy, they raised the "anti-relocation, anti-evacuation, anti-sabotage" slogan under the leadership of the Party. Under this call, in just two weeks, more than a thousand workers organized three factory protection brigades. Jin Longshan was the production team leader of the hull factory and served as the captain of the Second Brigade. This movement was immediately suppressed by Gui and his secret agents, who sent a division of marine corps to the factory. The agents threatened with arrest and "military law." The workers were not intimidated. On the contrary, they turned the organization of the factory protection team from public to underground and fought the reactionaries more resolutely. Jin Longshan had always been highly respected among the workers. When he organized unemployed workers in 1946, he was arrested and interrogated by the Kuomintang police, who asked him who he knew. This cold-working worker, who entered the factory as an apprentice at the age of eleven, learned boxing at thirteen, taught boxing and took disciples at sixteen, joined the Green Gang at twenty, and joined the Communist Party at twenty-nine, calmly replied, "In Shanghai, I have seven thousand colleagues, five thousand apprentices, and three thousand brothers, totaling fifteen thousand people." The reactionaries feared the strength of the workers and finally released him.
    Under the arrangement of the organization, Jin Longshan carried out mobilization work. Because of his continuous participation in leading the workers' movement over the years, his connection with the masses was very close. Many workers refused to move the factory under his encouragement. He said to the workers who were generally not politically aware, "We can only have work if we have a factory. If the factory is not protected, we will have no food to eat. As long as we have this factory, we will have food to eat." These words grasped the workers' psychology. He told the hot-working, cold-working, and technical workers, "We are not movers; we don't move things." He also encouraged the foremen of the movers to run away so that the enemy could not organize the movers. The enemy used silver dollars as bait to deceive technical workers into going to Taiwan. Jin Longshan persuaded them not to go. He said that at that time, he did nothing else all day but distribute leaflets and secretly talk to people. One technical worker wavered several times. Jin Longshan patiently persuaded him again and again, a total of seven or eight times. Finally, that person stayed before boarding the ship.
  Spending Half an Hour to Remove a Screw
    The bandits' marine corps threatened the workers with words like "You will be shot if you don't move," but it still had no effect. Finally, they had to order more than a hundred armed secret agents from the "Guard Camp," who specialized in suppressing workers, to move. "That's even better; these people don't understand machines; they can't disassemble them, and they can't move them." Jin Longshan said excitedly, "The bandits forced us to disassemble, and we specialized in finding some old, unusable, or unimportant parts to disassemble slowly. It took half an hour to remove a screw. Everyone tried to procrastinate. The important and good equipment was left behind or secretly hidden and buried underground. As a result, only some bulky iron plates and angle irons were moved away."
    "The person in charge of the warehouse was also persuaded by us," Jin Longshan said. "The person in charge of the keys would ask for leave today, and the other would run away tomorrow. The only warehouses that could be opened were those that stored ordinary equipment. The bandits drove in three landing craft and a merchant ship to load things. Originally, a landing craft could hold three thousand tons, but only one thousand tons were loaded."
    I asked him how it was loaded. He said, "That requires brainstorming. When we loaded the equipment onto the ship, we deliberately put it in a chaotic manner. On the one hand, we also united with the engineers to deceive the enemy, saying that the square boxes must be moved away." Jin Longshan explained to me that the square boxes were huge empty iron boxes brought by the Americans to build temporary floating docks. The boxes could be connected to form a dock. These were unimportant things, but they were huge in volume and took up the most space. After three hundred were moved, the cabin was full.
    The technicians were also united. They avoided the factory. Of the ten cranes, only three were running. This was how it started on the first day of moving. On the second day, none of them moved. They had to use the most primitive tools to lever and transport them.
    Half a month before liberation, when the enemy saw that it could not be moved, it arrested the leaders of the trade union. The workers went to bail them out, but they were not released. The condition was to guarantee that two hundred people would move. The workers discussed and agreed. But they mobilized some old men and children to make up the number, so of course, not much could be moved.
    Once, the bandits ordered the loading of eight naval guns onto the ship. The workers deliberately made the ship's hull unbalanced. When the Huangpu River receded, the guns and the ship all capsized into the river. Jin Longshan said with a smile:
    "It was hard to move for more than a month, and only two ships were filled. As a result, one had to be sunk! ... We immediately salvaged what sank like that after liberation."
  Nine Barrels of Gasoline Turned into Clear Water
    On the eve of liberation, the Gui Yongqing gang had no other way but to destroy the shipyard. But Jin Longshan and his comrades united the workers and carried out various flexible struggles with the enemy to protect the people's huge property. They put the broken machines in the center of the factory, moved the good machines to the side in a safe place, stored valuable things separately, took tools home and buried them, and replaced nine of the twelve barrels of gasoline that the enemy had prepared for arson with clear water. ... On May 19th, the enemy sent marines to set up machine guns to guard the factory gate, preventing workers from entering the factory. On May 21st, the enemy was inhumane, insane, and used explosives to explode and set fire to this most important shipyard in China, which was created by the hard work of the working masses.
    Jin Longshan said that at that time, he heard the sound of the explosion in the factory at home, and he felt unspeakable pain and resentment when he thought that the factory where he had worked for twenty-nine years was being destroyed. "My heart at that time was like being filed by a file!" But at the same time, he also thought that when the Kuomintang reactionaries' doomsday arrived, it would be the day when the working class would turn over and become the masters of the house. On the morning of the 25th, before dawn, Jin Longshan was sleeping in a temple in Zhangjiazhai. He got up to urinate outside and saw several horses tied up. He looked closely and exclaimed, "Ah! It's the People's Liberation Army that we have been looking forward to for months and years!" He immediately ran to wake up the nearby factory protection team members, gathered them together, contacted the People's Liberation Army at the factory gate, and entered the factory. Sentries were placed around, and part of the factory protection team was formed into the People's Security Team to protect their factory.
  Saving Ten Billion Yuan
    The other part of the factory protection team was organized into a repair team, which quickly repaired the factory that had been destroyed by the enemy. The Second Brigade led by Jin Longshan, more than half of the two hundred people, organized repairs, and Jin Longshan was responsible. Of the three docks in the Jiangnan Factory, Dock No. 3 was the largest and suffered relatively little damage. Jin Longshan and the workers discussed and told everyone that the task of supporting the front was urgent. It was decided to repair Dock No. 3 and use a crane to lift the gate that was submerged in the water. However, the engineer who was ordered by the administrative department to repair Dock No. 3 calculated that Jin Longshan's estimate of the total weight of the gate, including the water, the silt in the cabin, and the suction of the silt outside the cabin, was incorrect, and the crane could not lift it anyway. Only after building a dam and draining the water in the dock could it be lifted. This project was huge and would take at least three and a half months to complete. Jin Longshan believed that the task was urgent and could not wait that long. Based on his and other workers' work experience of one or twenty years, he believed that their estimate of the weight of the gate was correct, and the method of using a crane would only take one and a half months. The administration and the workers held several meetings together. Jin Longshan even said, "If it doesn't succeed, I am willing to cut off my head." Finally, the administration agreed. During the work, after two failures, he did not lose heart and continued to lead the workers to persevere until the gate was lifted. The entire repair project was completed in forty-two days, three days earlier than his original estimate. It was calculated that using his method saved a total of ten billion yuan in labor and material costs.
    The other parts of the factory were also quickly repaired. A person in charge of the administrative department said, "If we had used this speed to move the factory for the bandits at that time, I'm afraid we would have moved all the soil together!"
    But Jin Longshan said with a smile, "This is not my strength alone; this is everyone's contribution. Without the leadership of the Party and the Party's training, what could I do!" (Attached picture)

　　护厂英雄金龙山
    袁水拍
  一双磨了二十九年的手
    密密麻麻的小字，一个一个地，慢慢地正在笔记本上写下来。从纸的一头写到另一头，不留下任何空白。握钢笔的，是一只起了重重叠叠老茧，每一个指甲都磨损了的粗大的手。这双手在炉子边，船壳下，已经磨了二十九年。当它还是稚嫩的时候，它牵着母亲的衣角，在家乡高邮，一起去帮地主家打短工，放牛。十岁，这双手在上海的垃圾堆上检煤屑，拾布角；也和欺生的检垃圾小孩打架。十一岁，这双手开始在江南造船所拉风箱，烧铆钉……直到现在，它割钢板，做旋工。这双手曾经拿过两角半一天的最低的工资，也领导过七千多失业工人，向日寇索取了二十三亿元解散费和维持费。这是一双具有上海工人阶级的光辉革命传统的辛勤劳动，英勇斗争的手……。
    金龙山正在招待所里写着准备在大会上的发言。钢笔在粗大的手里显得太细小。他笑着说：“我写字写不好，以前更不像样，最近在党校学习了几个月，写得比较快了些。”他告诉我只读过八个月私塾。可是我看他的字写得很整齐，认真。他聚精会神使用着他所不熟习的另一种工具。我对他说，你有了那样顽强战斗的意志和钻研学习的精神，任何困难都能够克服的。
    于是我请他谈谈他在上海解放前怎样领导江南造船所的护厂斗争的经过。
  反搬运、反疏散、反破坏
    当人民解放军胜利结束了淮海战役，南下长江，进军京沪的时候，伪海军司令桂匪永清阴谋要把这有了八十余年历史，能够修建万吨船舰和制造飞机的全国最大规模的造船厂的器材和技工，迁往台湾。工人们识破这个诡计后，就在党的领导下，提出了“反搬运，反疏散，反破坏”的护厂三反口号。在这个号召下，短短两个星期内，就有一千多工人组织了三个护厂大队。金龙山是船体厂的生产组组长，担任第二大队大队长。这个运动立刻遭到桂匪及其特务的压迫，派遣了一个师的海军陆战队进驻工厂。特务们用逮捕和“军法处置”来威胁。工人们并没有被吓倒。相反，他们把护厂队的组织，由公开转到地下，更加坚决地和反动派进行斗争。金龙山一向在工人中威信很高。当一九四六年他组织失业工人时，曾经被国民党警察局抓去讯问过，问他认识那些人。这个十一岁进厂做学徒，十三岁学打拳，十六岁教拳收徒弟，二十岁加入青帮，二十九岁加入共产党的冷作工人镇静地回答说：“在上海我有同行七千，徒弟五千，弟兄三千，一共认识一万五千人。”反动派忌惮工人的力量，终于释放了他。
    在组织的布置下，金龙山进行着动员工作，由于历年来不断参加领导工人运动，他和群众的联系十分紧密，许多工人在他的鼓动下，拒绝搬厂。他对一般政治水平不高的工人说：“我们有了工厂才能有工做。工厂不保护好，我们就没有饭吃。只要有这个厂，我们就有饭吃。”这几句话抓住了工人的心理。他对热作、冷作和技术工人说：“我们不是搬运工人，不会搬东西。”他又鼓动搬运工人的领班逃开，使敌人不能组织搬运工人。敌人以银元作饵，来欺骗技术工人去台湾，金龙山就向他们进行说服劝阻的工作。他说，那时候，他整天不做旁的事，就是发传单和偷偷地找人谈话。有一个技术工人几次三番动摇，金龙山耐心地劝了又劝，一共七八次。最后在临上船前，那人到底留了下来。
  卸一只螺丝花半点钟
    匪帮的陆战队用“不搬就要枪毙”的话来恫吓工人，也还是没有效果。最后只得命令专门镇压工人的一百多名特务武装“警卫营”去搬。“那更好了，这批人不懂机器，不会拆卸，也不会搬运。”金龙山谈到这里兴奋地说：“匪帮强迫我们拆卸，我们专找一些旧的不能使用的或者无关紧要的零件，慢吞吞地拆。卸一只螺丝花半点钟。大家尽量拖拉敷衍。把重要的和好的器材留下来，或者偷偷掩藏，埋在地下。结果只搬走了一些笨重的铁板和三角铁。”
    “仓库的负责人也被我们说服了，”金龙山说：“管钥匙的人今天这个请假，明天那个跑开。能打开的只是一些放普通器材的仓库。匪帮开来三艘登陆艇和一艘商船装东西。本来一艘登陆艇好装三千吨，结果只装了一千吨。”
    我问他怎样装的。他说：“那就要动脑筋，我们把器材装载上船时，故意横七竖八地乱放。一方面和工程师也团结好，欺骗敌人，说必须把方箱搬走。”金龙山给我解释，方箱是美国人运来的一种临时搭浮动码头用的巨大的铁板空箱，箱与箱连结起来就可以做码头用，这是不重要的东西，可是体积庞大，最费地位，搬了三百多只舱里就放满了。
    技工也被团结在一起，他们避不到厂，十架起重机，只开动了三架，开始搬的第一天是这样。到了第二天，一架也不动了。只好用最原始的工具来杠运。
    到了解放前半个多月，敌人眼看搬不动，就逮捕工会的领导分子。工人去保，不放。条件是要保证有两百人搬。工人商议后，答应了。可是他们动员了一些老头子和小孩去凑数，当然搬不走多少东西。
    有一次匪徒命令把八门海军用炮装上船去，工人们故意把船身装得不平衡，当黄浦江退潮的时候，连炮带船全部翻进了江。金龙山微笑地说：
    “好容易搬了一个多月，只装满了两条船，结果还要沉掉一条！……这样沉掉的，解放以后我们马上捞了起来。”
  九桶汽油变成清水
    桂永清匪帮临到解放前夕，再也无法可施，就只有把造船所破坏。但金龙山和他的同志们团结了工人和敌人进行各式各样灵活的斗争，来保护人民的巨额财产。他们把坏机器放在厂的中央，把好机器移到侧边安全的地方，把贵重东西分散储藏，把工具带到家里掩埋，把十二桶敌人准备放火燃烧的汽油换去了九桶，变成了清水。……到了五月十九日，敌人派陆战队架起机关枪把守厂门，不准工人进厂。一十一日，敌人灭绝人性，丧心病狂，用炸药爆炸，并放火焚烧这劳动大众艰苦创造的中国最重要的造船厂。
    金龙山说，那时候，他在家里听到厂里爆炸的声音，想到他工作了廿九年的工厂受到破坏，说不出地痛心和愤恨，“我那时的心，像被锉刀锉着一样！”可是同时，他也想到：国民党反动派末日到来的时候，也正是工人阶级翻身当主人的日子。二十五日早上，天还没有亮，金龙山睡在张家宅的一个庙里，起来到外面小便，看见好几匹马拴着，仔细一看，啊！原来就是月月年年盼望着的解放军！他立刻跑去叫醒附近护厂队队员，一下子集合拢来，和厂门口的解放军一联系，就进厂了。周围布下哨岗，护厂队一部分编成人民保安队，保卫起自己的工厂来。
  节省了十亿元
    另一部分的护厂队就组织成抢修队，迅速抢修被敌人破坏的工厂。金龙山领导的第二大队一半二百多人，组织抢修，由金龙山负责。江南厂三只船坞中，三号船坞最大，损失比较轻。金龙山和工人们一商量，告诉大家支援前线的任务紧急后，决定抢修三号船坞，用吊车把沉在水里的闸门吊起来。但受行政方面命令修理三号船坞的工程师计算后，认为金龙山把闸门连水，带舱里的泥沙和舱外泥沙的吸力，这总的重量估计得不正确，用吊车无论如何吊不起。只有筑坝后把坞里的水抽干，才能吊起。这个工程很大，至少要三个半月才能完成。金龙山认为任务紧急，不能等那么久。凭他和别的几个工人一二十年来的工作经验，认为他们对闸门重量的估计是正确的，而使用吊车的方法只要一个半月。行政和工人一起开了几次会，金龙山甚至说：“如果不成功，我愿意把头砍下来。”最后，行政同意了。工作进行中经过两次失败，他没有灰心，依旧领导工人坚持下去，直到把闸门捞起。全部修理工程在四十二天内完成，比他原来的估计还提早三天。计算采用他的方法，共节省工料费十亿元之巨。
    工厂的其他部分也迅速地修好了，行政部分的一个负责人说：“如果当时用这样的速度来替匪帮搬工厂的话，怕不连泥土也一起搬光！”
    但金龙山微笑地说：“这不是我一个人的力量，这是大家的功劳。要没有党的领导，党的培养，我能做什么！”（附图片）
