Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 13th: In order to welcome the large-scale land reform movement this autumn, the rural areas of the Central and Southern District are universally carrying out the work of rectifying farmers' associations.

After the rent reduction movement this spring, the farmers' associations in the Central and Southern District have gradually grown stronger. The district now has 25,250,000 farmer association members, accounting for 21.3 percent of the district's agricultural population. All six provinces in the district have successively convened provincial farmer representative conferences, electing and establishing the leadership bodies of the provincial farmer associations. In various rural social reform movements, the farmer associations have united the broad masses of farmers to fight against feudal forces, playing a significant role. However, with the exception of Henan Province, the problem of impure composition of grassroots farmer associations in various provinces is still relatively serious. It is estimated that more than 20 percent of grassroots farmer associations are controlled by landlords and feudal forces. Therefore, many grassroots farmer association cadres have engaged in illegal activities by shielding landlords and bullies.

The reasons for the impure composition of grassroots farmer associations, in addition to individual fake farmer associations organized by a few illegal landlords attempting to undermine rural social reform, are mainly due to the premature establishment of farmer associations without regard to specific conditions; and the failure to gradually educate and raise the class consciousness of farmers in the movement before starting identification and absorption. Some cadres have a simplistic view of completing tasks in organizing farmer associations, resulting in a bias towards simply pursuing numerical targets in their work. Now, the work of rectifying grassroots farmer associations in various provinces has achieved some results. Many areas have resolutely and cautiously purged class alien elements who have infiltrated the farmer associations, absorbed a large number of new members, and united farm laborers, poor peasants, middle peasants, and other working people and impoverished intellectuals in rural areas, so that the organization of farmer associations has been enriched and consolidated.

In the work of rectifying grassroots farmer associations in the Central and Southern District, the general approach is to combine it with the central work at the time and place, mobilize the masses of farmers to carry out rectification, promote democracy, and conduct commendation and model-setting through farmer representative meetings, and carry out self-criticism and mutual criticism. Farmer association cadres and members with shortcomings have all conducted self-examinations, or have been criticized and educated by all members. After such rectification, the class consciousness of grassroots farmer association members has generally been raised a step further. Conversely, for example, the rectification of the farmer association in Zhongyangtang Village, Hengshan County, Hunan Province, did not mobilize the masses of farmers, but simply replaced cadres by administrative order. As a result, the leadership of the farmer association in the village was still manipulated behind the scenes by landlords even after three rounds of cadre replacements. Also, some areas have separated from the central work, disregarding the current urgent demands of farmers, and rectified farmer associations in isolation, resulting in low morale among farmers and failure to achieve the purpose of rectification.

The above-mentioned biases in the rectification work have been noted and corrected in various places. In general, emphasis has been placed on treating the original grassroots farmer association cadres differently, opposing the erroneous method of kicking them all away and simply purging them without distinction.

In addition, in the rectification of farmer associations in the Central and Southern District, it was discovered that a few illegal landlords and bully elements took the opportunity to spread rumors and sabotage, sow discord among farmers, and expand the dissatisfaction of some farmers with individual cadres who had become detached from the masses. Now, all localities are paying close attention to this; resolute blows have been dealt to illegal landlords, and attention has been paid to strengthening the solidarity education of farmers, raising their political vigilance.

### 巩固壮大农民队伍迎接土改  中南各地普遍整顿农协组织

　　巩固壮大农民队伍迎接土改
    中南各地普遍整顿农协组织
    【新华社汉口十三日电】为了迎接今年秋后大规模的土地改革运动，中南区农村正普遍地开展整顿农民协会的工作。
    经过今年春季的减租运动，中南区的农民协会已经逐渐壮大。全区现有农民协会会员二千五百二十五万人，占全区农业人口的百分之二十一点三。全区六个省均先后召开了省的农民代表大会，选举与成立了省农民协会的领导机构。农民协会在各项农村社会改革运动中，团结广大农民，与封建势力进行斗争，起了很大的作用。但是，除河南省外，各省基层农民协会成份不纯的现象仍较严重，估计约有百分之二十以上的基层农民协会被地主封建势力所操纵。因此，不少基层农民协会的干部有包庇地主恶霸进行非法活动的行为。
    基层农民协会成份不纯的原因，除少数不法地主企图破坏农村社会改革而组织的个别假农会以外，主要是由于不问具体条件，过早地建立农民协会；不是在运动中逐步教育与提高农民的阶级觉悟，然后开始甄别吸收。部分干部对组织农民协会有单纯完成任务的观点，以致工作中发生单纯追逐数目字的偏向。现在，各省整顿基层农民协会的工作，已经获得了一些成绩。许多地区已坚决地慎重地清洗了混入农民协会的阶级异己分子，吸收了大批新的会员，团结了雇农、贫农、中农以及农村中其他劳动人民和贫苦知识分子，使农民协会的组织得到充实与巩固。
    中南区整顿基层农民协会的工作中，一般是结合当时当地的中心工作，发动农民群众进行整顿，发扬民主，通过农民代表会议进行评功表模，开展自我批评与相互批评。有缺点的农民协会干部和会员，均进行了自我检讨，或者由全体会员展开批评，进行教育。这样经过整顿后，基层农民协会会员的阶级觉悟普遍提高了一步。反之，如湖南省衡山县中洋塘村整顿农民协会，没有发动农民群众，只是用行政命令撤换干部，结果撤换了三次干部，该村农民协会的领导，仍为地主在背后操纵。又如有些地区脱离中心工作，不管农民当前的迫切要求，孤立地整顿农民协会，以致农民情绪不高，整顿的目的亦未达到。
    上述整顿工作中的偏向，各地均已注意纠正。一般都强调了对原有基层农民协会干部的分别对待，反对不加区别地一脚踢开、单纯清洗的错误方法。
    此外，中南各地在整顿农民协会中，曾发现少数不法地主恶霸分子乘机造谣破坏，挑拨农民间的团结，扩大部分农民群众对个别脱离群众的干部的不满。现在各地对此已密切注意；对不法地主进行了坚决打击，同时注意加强对农民的团结教育，提高了农民的政治警觉性。
