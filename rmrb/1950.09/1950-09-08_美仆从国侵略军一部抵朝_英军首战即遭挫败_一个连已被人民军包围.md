Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Driven by U.S. imperialism, ground forces from U.S. vassal states have been thrown into the quagmire of the Korean War. According to a Reuters dispatch on the 3rd: "British troops today began moving to the South Korean front." They were two battalions of infantry that arrived in Korea from Hong Kong on August 29th. According to Agence France-Presse: Another British "commando" unit left Britain by air on the 5th, bound for Korea. Following Britain, an advance contingent of the Australian army, sent to assist the U.S., has arrived in Japan, ready to transfer to Korea. Advance contingents from the Philippines and Turkey are also preparing to depart for Korea this month. U.S. authorities are now doing their best to urge vassal states that have promised to send troops to "quickly" fulfill their promises, while further extorting more cannon fodder from various countries.

To date, the thirteen vassal states that have decided to serve the U.S. include: Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, Bolivia, Costa Rica, and Greece, with a total of approximately 30,000 troops.

U.S. imperialism has taken great pains to organize this motley army. Although the U.S. Congress passed a resolution as early as the end of July authorizing Truman to threaten countries with reduced "economic aid" to force them to send troops, the majority of United Nations member states still did not agree to send troops. In a notification to Lie on August 29th, the Pakistani government reiterated that it "cannot send troops to join the United Nations forces in Korea" (United Press). And the Brazilian authorities, on whom the U.S. placed its greatest hopes, also "formally denied any intention of Brazil to send troops to Korea" on August 26th (Reuters).

Of the thirteen countries that have agreed to send troops, apart from a small number of "advance contingents" from a few countries, the deployment of the remaining motley forces will still take time. Canada's "special infantry brigade" is still in the recruitment phase; the recruitment of Belgium's 1,000 "volunteers" "has not proceeded as planned" (United Press). Most countries have not sent regular armies as requested by the U.S., but have instead used poorly trained "national guardsmen" as "volunteers." Costa Rica's "volunteers" even need to "receive preliminary training in the United States" first (U.S. Information Service). And the so-called "best" infantry selected by the Philippines are "trained according to American standards" and are not suitable for combat in Korea, so "these troops still need to be trained in Korea or Japan before participating in the war to cope with the Korean type of combat" (United Press). These countries' delaying tactics have caused MacArthur's impatience. According to an Associated Press dispatch: MacArthur emphasized in a report to the Security Council on the 2nd: "My most urgent concern is ground troops... I think I should state that this assistance should come quickly without delay."

Xinhua News Agency, 7th. According to Associated Press reporter McBeth, who accompanied the British troops, the British army suffered its first defeat in combat on the Korean front. It is claimed that a company of British troops was surrounded by the Korean People's Army on the evening of the 5th. A senior U.S. military officer said: He deduced that "British soldiers have suffered their first losses in the war." When the British troops entered the position on the evening of the 4th, they were subjected to heavy artillery bombardment, and on the evening of the 5th, they were subjected to a long bombardment.

### 美仆从国侵略军一部抵朝  英军首战即遭挫败  一个连已被人民军包围

　　美仆从国侵略军一部抵朝
    英军首战即遭挫败
    一个连已被人民军包围
    【新华社七日讯】在美帝国主义的驱使下，美国仆从国家的地面部队，已投入朝鲜战争的泥潭。据路透社三日讯：“英国军队今日开始向南朝鲜前线移动”，他们是于八月二十九日由香港到达朝鲜的两营步兵。据法新社讯：另一支英国“突击队”已于五日由英国首途空运赴朝鲜。继英国之后，澳大利亚的援美陆军先遣队一部，已抵日本，准备转赴朝鲜。菲律宾及土耳其的援美先遣队亦准备于本月内开赴朝鲜。美当局现在正尽力催促答应出兵的仆从国家“迅速”履行诺言，同时还进一步对各国勒索更多的炮灰。
    迄今为止，决定为美国效劳的已有：英、澳、加、新西兰、法、荷、比、菲、泰、土、玻利维亚、哥斯达黎加及希腊等十三个仆从国家，兵员总数约三万余名。
    美帝国主义为了组织这支杂牌军，曾经煞费苦心。尽管美国会早于七月底便通过决议，授权杜鲁门以削减“经济援助”威胁各国出兵，但多数联合国会员国仍然没有应承出兵。巴基斯坦政府于八月二十九日致赖伊的通知中再度申明，该国“不能派遣部队参加在朝鲜的联合国部队”（合众社）。而美国指望最殷的巴西当局，也在八月二十六日“正式否认巴西有派遣军队至朝鲜的任何意图”（路透社）。
    在已答应出兵的十三个国家中，除了少数国家的少数“先遣队”外，其余杂牌部队的派出，尚需时日。加拿大的“特别步兵旅”尚在招募阶段；比利时一千“志愿兵”的招募工作“未能按计划进行”（合众社）。多数国家并未按照美国的要求派出正规陆军，而以训练不足的“国民兵”充当“志愿军”。哥斯达黎加的“志愿军”甚至需先“至美国受初步训练”（美新闻处）。而菲律宾所挑选的所谓“最好的”步兵，则因“受的是美国标准的训练”，不适于在朝鲜作战，因而“这些兵员在参战之前，还需在朝鲜或日本受训，以应付朝鲜型的战斗”（合众社）。这些国家的拖延行为，引起了麦克阿瑟的不耐烦。据美联社讯：麦克阿瑟二日在致安理会的报告中强调说：“我最急切关心的是地面部队……我认为我应该说明：这些援助应毫无耽搁地迅速前来。”
    【新华社七日讯】据美联社随英军记者麦克贝斯六日报道：英军在朝鲜前线首次作战即遭挫败。据称：一连英军曾于五日晚间被朝鲜人民军包围。一位美国高级军官称：他推断“英国兵已受到战争中的第一次损失”。英军于四日晚间进入阵地时，即受到大炮的猛轰，五日晚上，又遭到为时颇久的轰击。
