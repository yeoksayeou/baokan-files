A Good Daughter of the People, An Outstanding Communist Party Member
Zhao Guilan
She Maintained Her Party Spirit

December 19, 1949, the whistle signaling the end of the shift had already sounded at the Dalian Jianxin Factory. Zhao Guilan walked out of a workshop, holding a package of fulminate of mercury, ready to send it to the mixing room. When she was twenty-odd steps away from the mixing room, she suddenly felt dizzy, her vision went black, and she couldn't stand steady. She just thought "Oh no," if she fell and the "fulminate of mercury" exploded... she couldn't hold on and fell.

"The fulminate of mercury is going to explode!" It was as if someone shouted this, and she subconsciously wanted to throw the fulminate of mercury away. In this moment of life and death, like a flash of light across her mind, she remembered what the comrades had earnestly taught her during the Party class: "When the interests of the Party conflict with personal interests, we should not hesitate to obey the interests of the Party and sacrifice ourselves." At this time, she clearly saw her beloved factory: twenty steps ahead was the workshop, full of explosive chemicals, and if an explosion occurred there, it would affect the entire factory, and nearby was the warehouse... These were all valuable property of the people. She made up her mind, "Can't throw it away!" "Can't throw it away!" She closed her eyes tightly and used all her strength to hold the package of fulminate of mercury tightly. Finally, with a "boom," the nearby glass shattered, and Zhao Guilan fell in a pool of blood.

The Superior Qualities of a Bolshevik Supported Her in Overcoming Inhuman Suffering

The workers ran over, wrapped her in cotton quilts, and when they put her in the car, Zhao Guilan had already become a bloody figure: half of her left arm was blown away, with bones sticking out; the muscles above and below the joint of her right arm were shattered, and blood vessels were broken; the wounds on her face and head were turned outward, with blood gurgling out; her lips were cracked; and her chest was also injured.

The workers looked at her, and everyone cried.

She did not cry, did not shout, and tried her best to calm herself down. When it was extremely painful, she quietly told her brother, "Hurry up and go!"

In the factory hospital, emergency surgery was performed. The left arm was amputated. The head and chest were bandaged. The right arm was tied to a wooden board and lost sensation. Due to excessive blood loss, her body temperature dropped and her pulse was one hundred and twenty beats per minute. Everyone stared at the doctor's face, but the doctor only shook his head silently.

After the anesthetic wore off, she lay on the bed in unbearable pain, clenched her teeth tightly, and sweat streamed down her face like raindrops. Blood soaked through the gauze, and her body temperature rose to forty-one degrees. She struggled because of the intense pain, unable to sleep or eat, and the wound was severely inflamed. In this way, she endured a night of inhuman suffering without a single scream.

"As Long as the Heart is Still Beating, We Can Work for the Party." She Was Not Sad About Losing Her Left Hand

The next day, when she could barely endure it, she asked her brother in a difficult and low voice when she could be discharged from the hospital and whether she could still work. Her brother held back his grief and said, "You can work, just stay in the hospital for another month and then return to the factory." She said reassuringly, "That's good, as long as I can work!" Her brother's tears couldn't stop flowing.

Four days after the operation, the severe pain slightly subsided, and Zhao Guilan's consciousness began to clear. She felt that her left arm was a little lighter. While her brother was out, she used her left leg to prop up the quilt and looked at it. Her left hand was gone! She couldn't help but feel a pang of sorrow and cried sadly. Her brother came in and rushed to ask, "Sister, what's wrong?" She didn't say anything, her eyes filled with tears as she looked at her brother. After a while, she said heavily, "My hand is gone!" Her brother felt like a knife was twisting in his heart, and he almost cried out too, but he tried to suppress it. But she burst into tears for the first time.

Comrade Qian, deputy secretary of the Jianxin Party General Branch, came and asked her, "Comrade Zhao Guilan, why are you crying?" Zhao Guilan said painfully, "My hand is gone! I can no longer work. The Party has nurtured me in vain. My education is too low, and I won't be able to do more work for the Party in the future." The deputy secretary of the general branch comforted her, saying, "It is glorious for you to be injured for work. The people love you and sympathize with you. The Party has various kinds of work and will assign you appropriate work." Then he told her the story of "How the Steel Was Tempered," telling her that Paul Kochakin, due to his infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause and his high degree of selflessness in the arduous struggle, was blind and paralyzed in his hands and feet, but he continued to work. As long as his life had not completely extinguished, as long as his heart was still beating and his mind was still active, he would not stop dedicating himself to the Party and the revolutionary cause. Comrade Qian also told her the story of Sister-in-law Shuai and Grigory from "This is Just Love"....

Zhao Guilan believed the words of the deputy secretary of the general branch and realized that as long as the heart was still beating, she could work for the Party. She never shed tears again and never felt sad about her disability. A kind of irresistible force seemed to be injected into her body.

The Party Loves Its Good Daughter

The responsible comrades of the factory Party committee came to see her day and night, braving wind and snow, and told her the stories of Paul Kochakin, Danya, Wang Huanan, and Alexei from "A Real Man," supporting her to fight against the pain.

The factory invited five famous doctors for consultation. In order to preserve Zhao Guilan's right hand, Dr. Freisher, the director of surgery at the Sino-Soviet Hospital, took on this sacred task with all his knowledge and experience. He said, "We cannot let a young, upright Chinese female worker and patriot who is friendly to us become a completely disabled person."

Although her right arm was preserved, it was tied to a wooden board, straight and unable to move or bend, like a wooden stick. Freisher thought: Such a girl, with only one hand left, would be distressed when she ate and dressed in the future if it couldn't move. He decided to help her get rid of this distress. So he began the surgery to reconnect the tendons in her right arm. On February 7, another surgery was performed to graft skin from the right side of her abdomen to the wound on her right arm. From then on, her right arm and abdomen were sewn together. Her hand pressed heavily on her stomach, making it difficult for her to breathe. On February 24, the third surgery was performed to completely separate the pedicle graft. This time, the pain from the stitches made her bend over for eight days and eight nights.

She was in so much pain that she was covered in cold sweat until she lost consciousness, but she refused to groan, unwilling to affect others because of her own pain.

The Party loves its good daughter. Ouyang Qin, secretary of the CPC Lüda District Committee, Han Guang, chairman of the administrative office, Guo Shushen, chairman of the Federation of Trade Unions, Mayor Mao of Lüda City, Wu Yanan, chairman of the Lüda Women's Federation, and others all came to visit her one after another, giving her comfort and encouragement, saying that she was a good daughter of the people and an excellent member of the Party; they advised her to take good care of her health: "When you recover from your injury, come to the Party school to study, and we will help you improve your political and cultural awareness and train you to become a more intelligent talent."

She Has Radiant Revolutionary Optimism

Zhao Guilan understood the purpose of her life and struggle, so in the most critical moments, she did not consider her own sacrifice and maintained her Party spirit, which is why she was able to overcome the pain. Therefore, she can always maintain happiness. This is her optimism.

She often told people, "When I think of the suffering I went through in the past, I don't know where I get so much energy to work hard and produce more!" When she was seven or eight years old, she picked grass and manure, and the whole family worked, but they still couldn't make ends meet, and her younger sisters and brothers starved to death. At the age of nine, she ran from Anqiu, Shandong to Dalian. Her father and brother went to work as laborers and apprentices in factories, and she packed apples in a Japanese apple orchard, begged for food, and worked as a coolie. She had seen with her own eyes that poor people could not go to the hospital when they were sick, and when they died, they were rolled up in a broken straw mat and thrown into a ditch...

The Soviet army liberated Dalian, and she saw the light. In the first month of 1948, she entered the Jianxin Factory and regarded the factory as her own home. Her enthusiasm for work attracted everyone's attention and also attracted the attention of the Party. She quickly accepted the Party's education, and in December 1948, she gloriously became a member of the Communist Party. From then on, she worked even harder and loved the factory even more.

She was originally illiterate, not knowing a single word, and only began to study after entering the factory. Because she understood the pain of illiteracy, she was always nervous and tried her best to study. The day after she joined the Party, she took a small notebook and went to Comrade Shen Xinyu of the trade union, asking him to write down the time she joined the Party, the names of the introducers, the time for attending organizational activities, and the issues she should pay attention to in her daily life. She said, "Director Shen, I want to recognize every one of these words you wrote and be able to write them down."

When she was transferred to the chemical mixing room to learn technology, she encountered a female master who was not very willing to teach apprentices. She thought, "Being unhappy doesn't help. It's better to improve my education first, memorize the names of various chemical drugs, and then pay attention to how others mix them and learn slowly." She asked more questions when she saw that the female master was happy, and took time to study writing. She was already able to write the names and quantities of chemical drugs on a list and paste it on the wall. When she forgot, she would look up at the wall, thus overcoming the difficulties.

Her eldest brother did a good job in the Jianxin Factory, but he was unwilling to study. Zhao Guilan accepted the Party's task to influence and transform him. Once, Zhao Guilan asked him, "How's your work? Are you interested?" Her brother glared and said, "Work to eat, what interest is there!" Zhao Guilan smiled and continued, "Who works the best and studies the best in your department? You should learn from those who are the best." Her brother glared at his sister again and said, "I'm not weak at work either, probably much stronger than you!" Her brother became impatient as soon as he heard about studying, so he would argue back every time his sister said something. But his sister didn't get angry and patiently reasoned with her brother. In less than half a year, her brother's thinking opened up. Not only did he participate in studies, but he also made contributions to production and was admitted to the Party.

Zhao Guilan was very concerned about the workers and was willing to help people solve their difficulties, especially by helping them politically. Because she had no personal plans, she was always happy.

Defeat the Enemy, Advance!

On the eve of "May Day" in 1950, Zhao Guilan was discharged from the hospital. She had recovered her health. There were only two small glorious marks on her head and lips, and the incision on her chest had also healed. Her left hand had been fitted with a prosthetic hand. Her right arm, which had severed tendons, was not only preserved, but it could also bend and stretch, hold flowers, open books, and write!

No misfortune or pain has frightened her, nor has it damaged her strong will and courage to fight in the slightest.

Zhao Guilan's name quickly spread throughout the country. While she was sleeping in the hospital, letters of condolence from all over the country kept flowing into the hospital, and the enthusiasm of her great brothers warmed her. When she recovered and appeared in front of the masses, when she was on the train, when she came to Beijing, everywhere she went she could hear people cheering for her. Zhao Guilan brought glory to the working class and to the Party; and the people also gave glory to Zhao Guilan.

She has already joined the Party School in Lüda for study. She firmly remembers what Premier Zhou Enlai told her when he held her hand in June this year: "Be brave and have wisdom. You have done the first step, and you must study hard in the future. With wisdom, you can work better for the Party." In order to do more work for the Party, Zhao Guilan is happily and diligently studying. (Attached photo)

### 人民的好女儿  优秀的共产党员  赵桂兰

　　人民的好女儿  优秀的共产党员
    赵桂兰
    她保持了自己的党性
    一九四九年十二月十九日，大连建新工厂放工的汽笛已经响了。赵桂兰从一个工作室走出来，手里拿着一包雷汞，准备送到配置室去。走到离配置室还有二十几步，她忽然脑子发晕，眼前一阵黑，身子站不稳了。她刚想到“不好”，摔倒了“雷汞”要爆炸……，她已经支持不住而倒下去了。
    “雷汞要爆炸！”好像什么人大叫了这么一声似的，她下意识的想要把雷汞扔出去。在这生死交关的一刹那，像一道闪光掠过她的心头，她记起了上党课时同志们曾认真教育过她的话：“在党的利益与个人利益发生矛盾时，应该毫不犹疑地服从党的利益，牺牲个人。”这时候她就清晰地看见了她心爱的工厂：二十步前边就是工作室，那里边全是爆炸性的化学药品，那里发生了爆炸就会波及全厂，附近就是仓库……。这些都是人民宝贵的财产。她就下了决心，“不能扔！”“不能扔！”她闭紧眼睛，用全身的力量狠狠握住那包雷汞。终于，“轰”的一声，附近的玻璃震碎了，赵桂兰倒在血泊里了。
    布尔什维克的优越品质，支持她战胜非人所能忍的痛苦
    工友们飞跑过来，用棉被包住她送上汽车的时候，赵桂兰已经变成了一个血人：她的左臂的一半炸飞了，骨头伸在外边；右臂关节上下的肌肉已经炸烂，血管被炸断；脸上，头上的伤口往外翻着，汨汨地流着血；嘴唇裂开了；胸部也受了伤。
    工友们看着她，大家都哭了。
    她没有哭，没有叫，极力使自己镇静。痛极了的时候，悄悄告诉她的哥哥说：“快点走啊！”
    在工厂医院里，实行了紧急手术。左臂割断了。头部和胸部都用纱布包扎起来。右臂绑在木板上，失去了知觉。她因流血过多，体温下降，脉膊一百二十次。大家盯住大夫的脸，但大夫只默默的摇了摇头。
    麻药效用过去以后，她躺在床上痛得难以忍受，紧咬住牙关，汗像雨点一样从脸上流下来，血浸透了纱布，体温上升到四十一度，她由于剧烈的痛苦而挣扎着，不能睡，不能吃，伤口在很厉害的发炎。就这样，在非人忍受的痛苦里煎熬了一夜，她没有喊叫一声。
    “只要心脏还在跳动，就能为党工作”。她没有为自己失去左手而悲伤
    第二天她刚刚能忍住一些，就困难地用低微的声音问她的哥哥什么时候能出院，还能不能工作。她哥哥忍住悲痛说：“你能工作，再住一个月就回工厂。”她安心地说：“那就好，我能工作就行！”哥哥的泪止不住地流下来了。
    手术后的第四天，剧烈的痛苦稍微减轻，赵桂兰的知觉开始清醒。她发觉左胳膊有点发轻，趁着哥哥出去，她用左腿把被子支起来一看，左手没有了！她不由自主地一阵心酸，伤心地哭起来。哥哥进来抢着问：“妹妹，怎么了？”她没出声，眼含着泪水瞅着哥哥，一会儿她沉重地说：“哥哥，手没有了！”她哥哥心里像一阵刀绞，差一点也哭出来，她竭力压制下去。她却第一次放声痛哭起来。
    建新党总支副书记钱同志来了，问她：“赵桂兰同志，你为什么哭？”赵桂兰沉痛地说：“我的手没有了！我再也不能工作了。党白白培养了我。我文化太低，往后再不能为党多做工作了。”总支副书记安慰她说：“你为工作负伤是光荣的，人民爱护你，同情你。党有各种工作，会分配给你适当的工作的。”接着他就给她讲了“钢铁是怎样炼成的”的故事，告诉她，保尔·柯察金由于对革命事业的无限忠诚，在艰苦的斗争中高度的忘我精神，眼睛瞎了，手足瘫痪了，可是他还继续工作着。只要他生命还没有完全熄灭，只要他的心脏还在跳动，思想还在活动，他就不停止为党为革命事业献身。钱同志又给她讲了帅大姐和“只不过是爱情”里面戈里高礼的故事………。
    赵桂兰相信了总支副书记的话，认识到只要心脏还在跳动，就能为党工作，她就再没有淌过泪，没有为自己的残废感伤过。她的身上好像注入了一种什么不可抵御的力量。
    党爱护自己的好女儿
    工厂党的负责同志不分日夜，冒着风雪来看她，给她讲保尔·柯察金、丹娘、王化南，“真正的人”里面的阿历克赛的故事，支持她向痛苦作斗争。
    工厂请了五位有名的大夫来会诊。为了保留赵桂兰的右手，中苏医院外科主任医师弗列依舍尔就用他全部知识和经验，负起了这个神圣的任务。他说：“不能让一个跟我们友好的、中国的年青正直的女工和爱国者，变成一个完全残废的人。”
    她的右臂虽然保存下来，但绑在木板上，直直地不能动弹，也不能回弯，像一根木棍一样。弗列依舍尔想：这样一个女孩子，仅仅剩一只手，如果再不会动，将来吃饭、穿衣的时候她会苦恼。他决心帮助她解除这苦恼。于是就开始了右臂接筋的手术。二月七日再动手术，把她腹的右部皮肤用茎植皮术补到右臂缺皮的创伤上去。从此她的右臂和腹部缝在一起了。她的手沉重地压在肚子上，使她喘不过气来。二月二十四日第三次动手术，把茎植皮全部割离，这一次针口疼痛的使她弯着腰过了八天八夜。
    她疼的满头冷汗，直到失去知觉，她不肯呻吟，不愿因自己的痛苦而影响别人。
    党爱护自己的好女儿。中共旅大区党委书记欧阳钦，行署主席韩光，总工会主席郭述申，旅大市毛市长，旅大妇联主席吴亚南等都先后不断来看望她，给她安慰和鼓励，说她是人民的好女儿，党的优秀党员；劝她好好养病：“等你伤好以后，到党校来学习，帮助你提高政治和文化，把你培养成为更能发挥你的智慧的人材。”
    她具有光芒四射的革命乐观主义
    赵桂兰明白自己生活和斗争的目的，因此在最严重的关头，没有顾及到自己的牺牲，保持了自己的党性，这也就是她能战胜痛苦的原因。因而，她能经常保持愉快。这就是她的乐观主义。
    她常对人讲：“我一想起过去受的苦，也不知道从那里来的这么足的劲，要好好干，多生产！”她七八岁就拾草拾粪，全家劳动，种点庄稼还是混不上吃喝，妹妹、弟弟都饿死了。九岁从山东安邱跑到大连，父亲和哥哥进工厂当劳工和学徒，她就在日本苹果园里包苹果，也曾要过饭，当过苦工。她亲眼看见过穷人病了不能进医院，死了用破草席卷一卷扔到大沟里…………。
    苏军解放了大连，她看到了光明。一九四八年正月，她进了建新工厂，就把工厂当做自己的家。她的工作热情引起了大家的注意，也引起了党的注意。她很快地接受了党的教育，一九四八年十二月，就光荣的成为中共党员。从此，她的工作更起劲，更爱工厂了。
    她本来是个文盲，一个字也不认识，到工厂后才参加了学习。因为她懂得不识字的痛苦，所以她总是紧张的，用尽心力来学习。在她入党第二天，她就拿着一个小笔记本找到工会沈新裕同志那里，让他把她入党的时间，介绍人的姓名，过组织生活时间及本身日常所要注意的问题等都写下来。她说：“沈主任，我要把你写的这些字，一个一个的都认识了，而且还要会写下来。”
    她调到化学配置室学技术时，碰上那位女师傅不大愿意教徒弟。他心里想：“老苦闷不顶事，还是先把自己文化提高，能记住各种化学药品名称，再留心看人家怎么配，慢慢学吧。”她瞅着女师傅高兴了就多问，抽空就学习写字。她已经能把化学药品名称和分量写成单子，贴在墙上，有时忘了就抬头看看墙，这样克服了困难。
    她的大哥在建新工厂里做一手好活，但是不肯学习。赵桂兰接受党的任务，要来影响他，改造他。有一次，赵桂兰问他：“你工作怎样，有没有兴趣？”大哥把眼珠一楞说：“干活吃饭呗，什么兴来兴去的！”赵桂兰一笑，又接着说：“你们那里谁干活顶好，学习的顶好？你应该跟那些顶好的学习才行。”大哥又用眼珠子把妹妹一楞，说：“我干活也不弱呵，八成比你强的多！”大哥一听学习，就不耐烦了，所以妹妹说一句他就顶一句。妹妹可不发火，耐着性子跟大哥讲道理。不到半年，大哥思想打通了，不但参加了学习，在生产上也立了功，并且被吸收入了党。
    赵桂兰对于工友们非常关心，肯帮助人解决困难，尤其能从政治上给人以帮助。她由于没有个人打算，所以总是愉快的。
    战胜敌人，前进！
    一九五○年“五一”的前夜，赵桂兰出院了。她恢复了健康。她的头上和嘴边仅有两块很小的光荣记号，胸前开刀处也长平了。左手按上了假手。断了筋的右臂不仅保存下来，而且能屈能伸，能握住花束，能掀开书本，能够写字了！
    任何的不幸和痛苦，并没有把她吓倒，没有丝毫损伤她的坚强的意志和斗争的勇气。
    赵桂兰的名字迅速的传遍了全国。当她睡在医院的时候，全国各地的慰问信不断地流到医院去，伟大的弟兄们的热情温暖着她。当她痊愈了，出现在群众面前的时候，坐着火车，来到北京的时候，到处可以听见人们对她的欢呼。赵桂兰把光荣带给工人阶级、带给党；而人民也把光荣给予赵桂兰。
    她已经参加旅大的党校学习了。她牢牢记住今年六月间周恩来总理握住她的手告诉她的话：“要勇敢，还要有智慧。你做到了第一步，以后还要好好学习，有了智慧才能更好地为党工作。”为了给党做更多的工作，赵桂兰正愉快而辛勤地学习着。（附图片）
