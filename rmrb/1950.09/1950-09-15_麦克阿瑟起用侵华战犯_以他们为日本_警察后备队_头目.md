Xinhua News Agency, September 13th:

　　MacArthur blatantly directed the Yoshida government to employ former Japanese officers, including those who had engaged in aggressive activities in Northeast China, to lead the core of the new Japanese army, the so-called "Police Reserve Force." According to an International News Service report from Tokyo on September 11th: MacArthur Headquarters has allowed the Yoshida government to qualify former Japanese officers who are "not affected by the purge order" to hold "police positions." These former Japanese officers include all regular army and reserve army officers originally appointed as officers who served in the puppet "Manchukuo" in Northeast China from 1933 to 1945. A large proportion of the personnel recruited into the "Police Reserve Force" are former Japanese military personnel. According to a United Press report, among the 1,700 or so "Police Reserve Force" personnel recruited in Tokyo and its neighboring areas who gathered in Kodaira Village, Kitatama, Tokyo, on August 23, about two-thirds had military experience, including about 200 cadres who were former officers.
    According to a Reuters report on September 11th, quoting a Jiji Press dispatch, Justice Minister Takeo Ohashi told the National Diet's Local Administration Committee that small rifles had been distributed to the "Police Reserve Force." In the near future, the force will be equipped with "more powerful weapons," and the purchase of "vehicles with good maneuverability and short-wave telecommunications equipment" will be considered in the budget for the next fiscal year.

    以他们为日本“警察后备队”头目
    【新华社十三日讯】麦克阿瑟公然指使吉田政府起用包括曾在中国东北进行侵略活动的前日本军官，领导日本新陆军核心的所谓“警察后备队”。据国际新闻社东京十一日讯：麦克阿瑟总部允许吉田政府任用所谓“不受整肃令影响的”前日本军官有担任“警察职务”的资格。这些前日本军官包括所有原被任命为军官，而于一九三三年至一九四五年间到中国东北伪“满洲国”任职的正规军和后备军军官在内。在录取的“警察后备队”人员中，很大一部分都是前日本军事人员。据联合通讯社讯，于八月二十三日在东京北多摩小平村集中的在东京及其邻近各地招募的“警察后备队”人员一千七百余名中，有军队经验的竟占三分之二左右，其中前军官出身的干部人员约二百名。
    另据路透社十一日电引时事通讯社消息，法务府总裁大桥武夫告国会地方行政委员会说：小型步枪已分发给“警察后备队”。在最近的将来，该部队将装备“更加有力的武器”，并在下一会计年度的预算中考虑购置“具有良好机动性的车辆和短波电讯设备”。
