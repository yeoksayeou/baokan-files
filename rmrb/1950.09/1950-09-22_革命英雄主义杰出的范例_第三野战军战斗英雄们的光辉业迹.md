　　Outstanding Examples of Revolutionary Heroism
    ——The Glorious Deeds of the Combat Heroes of the Third Field Army
    [Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, September 18th] Our correspondent reports on the glorious deeds of the combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army:
    In the winter of 1945, a unit of the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army fought against the invading Kuomintang bandit troops at Baishan, northwest of Lincheng, Shandong. In order to capture a large bunker on the top of Baishan before dawn, the hero Chen Jinhe volunteered to rush up with a fast-acting grenade, destroyed the bunker, and heroically sacrificed himself in the soaring flames and smoke. Three years later, during the first phase of the Huaihai Campaign in the winter of 1948, demolition man Zhang Shucai also displayed the same immortal heroic behavior as Chen Jinhe. After a unit of the People's Liberation Army launched an attack on a regiment of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Huang Botao's corps besieged in the Nianzhuangwei area, the enemy's company entrenched in the forward bunker hindered the development of the battle. At this critical moment, the demolition hero Zhang Shucai stepped forward, grabbed explosives, pulled the fuse, and rushed towards the bunker to perish together with the enemy. The PLA's assault troops then quickly stormed into the village and victoriously resolved the battle.
    The heroic actions of Chen Jinhe and Zhang Shucai, who selflessly sacrificed themselves for the interests of the motherland and the people, have become shining examples for every commander and fighter in the People's Liberation Army.
    Under the education of the Chinese Communist Party, thousands upon thousands of similar heroic figures have emerged in the People's Liberation Army.
    In the Zhilanzhuang battle in Jiaodong in 1946, the hero Liu Kuiji, wounded, refused to leave the front line and led four wounded soldiers to hold their ground for a night under the fierce attack of enemies several times their number from three sides, becoming the decisive factor in winning the battle. The next day, he single-handedly charged into the enemy's position, wounding and capturing a total of about forty enemies. In the Subei Campaign of 1947, the PLA troops attacked the enemy's position, Fengshan, several times in a row, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. At this decisive moment, the hero Zhang Ming gathered and led more than thirty soldiers to launch a charge, capturing Fengshan with courageous and tenacious fighting, and finally annihilating the enemy. The heroes' resolute and decisive actions encouraged the vast number of commanders and fighters to create equally glorious achievements. In a blocking battle at Baimaguan in Luzhong in 1948, the hero Wei Laiguo single-handedly killed ninety-four enemies. Li Chengrong, a newly liberated soldier from a neighboring unit, heard this news and decided to learn from him, also setting a record of single-handedly killing twenty-nine enemies in one battle.
    The heroes' exemplary behavior is not only reflected in combat, but also in other aspects. In October 1947, a unit of the People's Liberation Army pursued the enemy towards Haiyang County (newly established county) in Jiaodong. When passing over a wooden bridge on the Wuolong River, Huang Xianghe, the battalion political instructor, found that a section of the bridge plank was not strong, so he immediately jumped into the water and used his back and shoulders to support the bridge plank, allowing the troops to pass quickly.
    Under the education and influence of the heroic models, many soldiers liberated from the Kuomintang bandit army have been transformed into active revolutionary fighters in the People's Liberation Army. Zhou Wenjiang, a combat hero of a certain unit, created an outstanding example in this regard during the Huaihai Campaign. His company, after two months of fierce fighting, suffered 111 casualties, but by the end of the campaign, his company had been revitalized from new soldiers to a company of 116 men, and was honored with the title of "First-Class Meritorious Company." Zhou Wenjiang used the gaps in the battle to mobilize veteran soldiers and Communists to warmly welcome the new fighters liberated from the battlefield, and used the method of veteran soldiers introducing their own life experiences to inspire the class consciousness of the new liberated fighters. At the gun awarding ceremony for the new liberated soldiers, he also emphasized how the weapons were obtained, who they were fighting, and how to cherish the weapons exchanged for blood by the old comrades to fight for the cause of the people's liberation. In the Wolf Mountain and Gu Mountain battles to block the Kuomintang bandit Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi corps from reinforcing the Huang Botao corps, a new liberated soldier named Cai Maodou, because he was wounded and unable to move, rolled down the mountain, preferring to die rather than be captured by the enemy.
    A particularly shining example in improving command art is the hero Guo Jisheng, who has gloriously sacrificed his life for the country. In the Tai'an Campaign in 1947, he meticulously and thoroughly organized the battle, giving full play to the initiative of all the commanders and fighters in the company, completed the task of breaking through Xiguan, occupying the Dai Temple with minimal casualties, and repelled more than twenty enemy counterattacks, capturing more than 600 enemies. His command art of "combining bravery with resourcefulness, and combining command with the masses" had an extremely significant impact on the entire army.
    The long-tested heroic models in the People's Liberation Army's Third Field Army will continue to actively and bravely lead the vast number of commanders and fighters in the glorious and arduous task of liberating Taiwan and consolidating national defense, and under the banner of collective revolutionary heroism, they will advance bravely and create new immortal achievements for the independence and honor of the motherland.

　　革命英雄主义杰出的范例
    ——第三野战军战斗英雄们的光辉业迹
    【新华社南京十八日电】本社记者报道人民解放军第三野战军战斗英雄们的光辉业迹称：
    一九四五年冬，人民解放军第三野战军某部在山东临城西北的柏山，和进犯解放区的国民党匪军作战。为了在天明以前攻下柏山顶上的一个大碉堡，英雄陈金合自告奋勇，抱着一个快速手雷冲上去，炸毁了大碉堡，而他自己也就在冲天的烟火之中壮烈牺牲。三年以后，在一九四八年冬天淮海战役的第一阶段作战中，爆破员张树才也表现了和陈金合一样不朽的英雄行为。解放军某部向被围在碾庄圩地区的蒋匪黄伯韬兵团的一个团发起攻击后，因为敌人的一个营据守着前沿地堡，阻碍了战斗的发展。这时，爆破英雄张树才便挺身而出，抱起炸药，拉开导火索，冲向地堡与敌人同归于尽。解放军的突击部队随着即迅速地杀进庄去，胜利地解决了战斗。
    陈金合和张树才这种为了祖国和人民利益而忘我牺牲的英雄行为已经成为人民解放军中每一个指战员的光辉榜样。
    在中国共产党的教育之下，人民解放军中已涌现出成千成万的同样的英雄人物。
    在一九四六年胶东芝兰庄战斗中，英雄刘奎基负伤不下火线，带领四个负伤战士，在几十倍敌人三面包围猛攻之下，坚守阵地一夜，成了取得战斗胜利的决定因素。第二天他又单身冲入敌阵，打伤和活捉敌人共四十名左右。在一九四七年宿（迁）北战役中，解放军部队接连数次攻击敌人的阵地烽山，双方伤亡重大。在此决定时刻，英雄张明便集合了和带领了三十多个战士举行冲锋，用英勇顽强的战斗，夺下了烽山，最后歼灭了敌人。英雄们坚决果敢的行为，鼓舞着广大指战员，去创造同样光辉的业迹。在一九四八年鲁中白马关的一次阻击战斗中，英雄魏来国单枪打死敌人九十四名。友邻部队一个新解放战士李成荣听到这个消息，决心向他学习，也创造了在一次战斗中单枪打死敌人二十九名的纪录。
    英雄们的模范行为不只表现在战斗中，也表现在其他方面。一九四七年十月间，解放军某部向胶东海阳县（新设县）追击敌人，经过五龙河上一座木桥，营教导员黄相和发现有一段桥板不牢固，便马上跳进水去用背和肩膀顶住桥板，让部队迅速通过。
    在英雄模范们的教育影响之下，许多从国民党匪军中解放过来的士兵，在人民解放军中被改造成为积极的革命战士。某部战斗英雄周文江在淮海战役中，曾经在这方面创造了杰出的范例。他所领导的一个连，经过两个月激战，伤亡一百十一人，但战役结束时，他的连因为吸收了大批的新解放战士已从新壮大为一百十六人的连队，并荣膺“一等功臣连”的称号。周文江利用战斗空隙发动老战士和共产党员们，热烈地欢迎从战场上解放过来的新战士，并由老战士介绍自己身世的办法，启发新解放战士的阶级觉悟。在给新解放战士举行授枪典礼时，他又着重说明武器是怎么得来的，是打谁的，和要怎样爱护老同志用血换来的武器去为人民解放事业而战。在阻击国民党匪军邱清泉、李弥兵团增援黄伯韬兵团的狼山、鼓山战斗中，有一个名叫蔡茂斗的新解放战士，因为负伤不能走动了，就滚下山去，宁死也不做敌人的俘虏。
    在提高指挥艺术上特别光辉的例子，就是业已光荣殉国的英雄郭继胜。他在一九四七年的泰安战役中，细致周密地组织了战斗，发挥全连指战员的积极性，以极小的伤亡完成了突破西关、占领岱庙的任务，并击退敌人二十多次反扑，俘敌六百多人。他的“英勇与机智结合，指挥与群众结合”的指挥艺术，在全军中起了极为重大的影响。
    人民解放军第三野战军中久经考验的英雄模范们，将在解放台湾、巩固国防的光荣而严重的任务中继续积极勇敢地带领着广大指战员，在集体的革命英雄主义的旗帜下奋勇前进，为祖国的独立和荣誉创造出新的不朽业迹。
