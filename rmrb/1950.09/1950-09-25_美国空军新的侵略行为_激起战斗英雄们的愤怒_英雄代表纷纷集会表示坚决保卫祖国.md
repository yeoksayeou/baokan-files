　　Several hundred combat hero representatives attending the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference today held gatherings, expressing boiling anger at the new acts of aggression by the U.S. imperialist air force in again violating our country's airspace and bombing the urban area of ​​An Dong, and unanimously stated their firm determination to defend the motherland by resolutely eliminating any aggressors who dare to take risks. Special Class Meritorious Service recipient Li Guoying, who represented Chinese youth on visits to Democratic Germany and North Korea, said: "We resolutely oppose this sinful act of aggression by U.S. imperialism. We demand severe punishment for the murderers. The United States must compensate for all the losses suffered by our country.” Twenty-five combat heroes from the North China Military Region unanimously stated: “In the past, Foreign Minister Zhou raised serious protests against the atrocities of American aircraft. Who knew that U.S. imperialism would become increasingly barbaric? We must demand that the United Nations General Assembly immediately discuss this issue and impose effective sanctions. If American aircraft dare to invade our country's airspace again, we will simply shoot them down.” Fifty-five combat hero representatives from the First Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army further warned the United States government to be responsible for all consequences. Tian Zhande, a combat hero from the field army who had been awarded five major merits, said: “If U.S. imperialism dares to invade our country, we will eliminate it wherever it goes.” Tai Xide, a combat hero from the Inner Mongolia Military Region, said: "We will never forget this newly added debt of blood. We resolutely oppose aggression and have the confidence to eliminate all aggressors on our country's borders." Bao Yitaoge Tao, a representative of minority combat heroes, said: "People all over the world support peace. We will definitely be able to defeat the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism and defend world peace." Currently, the combat hero representatives from various departments are initiating a joint letter to express their condolences to the injured compatriots, and resolutely stated: The armed forces of the Chinese people are strong. If U.S. imperialism dares to take risks, we will, in order to defend the motherland and defend peace, fear no sacrifice and resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the aggressors.
