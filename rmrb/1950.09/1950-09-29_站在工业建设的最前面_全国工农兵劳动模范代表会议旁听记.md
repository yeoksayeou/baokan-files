Standing at the Forefront of Industrial Construction
    ——Notes from Attending the National Conference of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    By Our Reporter Chen Ji
    Labor models are outstanding figures of the entire Chinese nation, and pioneers driving the victorious advancement of the people's cause in all fields. The exemplary reports presented at the National Conference of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers in the past two days have even more brilliantly demonstrated this point. Zhao Guoyou, the founder of the New Record Movement in Northeast China, painstakingly studied technology, repeatedly reformed tools, and, when hoisting the pulley of a belt-driven lathe, created a new record of completing one in fifty minutes, which was five times faster than the highest record of five hours during the enemy and puppet era, igniting a prairie fire of the New Record Movement in Northeast China. In just four months, more than 50,000 advanced producers created more than 20,000 various new records, enabling most factories in Northeast China to complete and exceed their production plans month after month and quarter after quarter. This great leading role is similarly manifested in the production team led by Ma Hengchang. Because the Ma Hengchang team created the experience of an advanced production team, 257 Ma Hengchang-style production teams emerged in public and private enterprises throughout Northeast China, and Ma Hengchang-style teams also appeared in Beijing, Tianjin, and other places within the customs, jointly striving to improve production quality and complete production tasks ahead of schedule. Heroes not only play such a magnificent leading role in industrial production, but also create brilliant precedents in all aspects of the people's cause. The "Mao Zedong" and "Iron Ox" locomotives are driving the rapid advancement of the people's railways, involving 200,000 railway employees in the Iron Ox Movement, creating many moving deeds. Model engineer Yu Songru mobilized the masses, serving the people with technology, pointing out the correct path that technical personnel should take today. Heroes have also opened up a broad path for women in New China to participate in industrial construction. The heroic deeds of female driver Tian Guiying and female tractor driver Liang Jun are educating and motivating women to bravely move forward.
    The representatives who spoke at the conference these past two days were all workers who were oppressed, exploited, and despised in the old society. Li Yong, who worked on the railway for twenty or thirty years, was still a "stinky worker" no matter how hard he worked in the past. Zhao Guoyou, who started as an apprentice in the puppet "Manzhou Work Institute" at the age of fifteen, suffered ten years of hardship. Because he had no money, he watched helplessly as his child died of illness because he had no medicine. Tian Guiying, at the age of seven, followed her father to fish, catch crabs, and harvest oysters on the vast sea, working hard from dawn to dusk throughout the year, but could not withstand the exorbitant taxes and levies of the puppet Manchukuo era and could not get enough to eat and stay warm. Liang Jun, who had been collecting vegetables and mending sacks for landlords since she was a child, was also a poor peasant "girl" who had always been subjected to humiliation.
    But today, they have all stood up, become masters of the country, and become outstanding heroes of the nation. People cheer for them, learn from them, and they have won the highest honor, standing majestically at the forefront of industrial construction, leading the working people of the whole country forward. Why are they able to do this? All the representatives who spoke said: It is the result of the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party and the arduous struggle of the heroic People's Liberation Army. Li Yong said: "Without Chairman Mao, wouldn't we still be stinky workers?" Zhao Guoyou said: "Without the leadership of the Party, how could we create new records?" Tian Guiying and Liang Jun both said in unison: "If the Communist Party had not liberated us, how could we women have become drivers and tractor drivers?" Yu Songru also deeply felt: "If it weren't for the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, our technology would not be developed."
    The reason why heroes are valuable is that they can connect with the masses, unite the masses, and mobilize the masses. From the exemplary reports of the heroes, one can further recognize this importance. The reason why Ma Hengchang was able to lead his ten-member team, with eight people not producing a single defective product in a year, is because he had three magic weapons: taking the lead in work; uniting all fellow workers; and sincerely teaching his skills to others. Yang Fuchun, chairman of the LinKou Locomotive Section Trade Union, said: The LinKou Locomotive Section Trade Union has been able to unite all the workers around it, rely on the strength of the masses to solve problems in production, and improve workers' welfare. Therefore, all the locomotives in the section safely traveled 1.14 million kilometers in 288 days without a single accident. Yu Songru encountered difficulties in welding when manufacturing the steam inlet of a turbine. Although he found the theory of "neutral flame welding nickel-chromium steel" in books, the nickel-chromium steel of the steam inlet still cracked during trial welding. When he went to Tang Yanzhang, a worker with thirty years of welding experience, Tang Yanzhang told him: "When using neutral flame welding to avoid cracks, it is necessary to repeatedly weld both sides simultaneously." As a result, the steam inlet was successfully manufactured. This is a powerful proof that technical personnel must connect with the masses. Why was Zhao Lan, director of the Shenyang Smelter, able to become a model director? He said that the main reason was that he could rely on the masses, learn from the masses, and mobilize the masses to solve important problems in production. With such a model director who can connect with the masses, the Shenyang Smelter was able to transform from a bad factory that often had accidents and could not complete its tasks into a good factory that rarely had accidents and often exceeded its tasks. The report of Li Jinghua, the conductor of the "Masses" train, is an even better illustration. Because they care about the difficulties of the masses and maintain close contact with the masses everywhere, their trains have traveled more than 150,000 kilometers in passenger service from February last year to August this year without a single passenger transport accident, receiving the warm love of the majority of passengers and receiving more than 100 letters of praise from all sides.
    Our country has achieved brilliant results in industrial construction this year. The total value of public industrial production in Northeast China this year will be equal to 193 percent of last year. The national people's railways have been restored to traffic and are normally moving towards development. This is the result of the struggle of labor heroes across the country. Our country has thousands upon thousands of heroes and models connecting with thousands upon thousands of people, overcoming difficulties, and advancing bravely. We have full confidence in striving for the early realization of the beautiful prospect of industrialization.

　　站在工业建设的最前面
    ——全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议旁听记
    本报记者  陈迹
    劳动模范是全中华民族的杰出人物，是带动各方面人民事业胜利前进的先锋。全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议这两天的典型报告，更光辉地表现了这一点。东北新纪录运动创始者赵国有，艰苦钻研技术，一再改造工具，在车皮带车床吊挂塔轮时，创造五十分钟做一个的新纪录，比敌伪时代最高纪录五点钟做一个提高了五倍，燃起了东北新纪录运动的燎原大火。仅仅四个月中，就有五万多先进生产者创造了两万多件各种各样的新纪录，使得东北大部工厂的生产计划月月完成，季季超过。这伟大的带头作用同样地表现在马恒昌领导的生产小组中，由于马恒昌小组创造了先进生产小组的经验，使得全东北公私企业出现了二百五十七个马恒昌式的生产小组，关内北京天津等地也出现了马恒昌式的小组，共同为提高生产质量、提前完成生产任务而奋斗。英雄们不仅在工业生产中发生如此雄伟的带头作用，而且在各方面人民事业里创造着灿烂的先例。“毛泽东号”、“铁牛号”机车带动着人民铁路迅速前进，使东北二十万铁路员工卷入了铁牛运动，创造了不少动人事迹。模范工程师于松如发动群众，把技术服务于人民，指出了今天技术人员应走的正确道路。英雄们还为新中国妇女参加工业建设开辟了大道，女司机田桂英和女拖拉机手梁军的英雄事迹，正教育着、推动着妇女们勇敢前进。
    这两天在会场上发言的代表们，都是过去在旧社会里被压迫、被剥削、被轻视的工人。干了二三十年铁路的李永，在过去怎么卖力地干，也是个“臭工人”。从十五岁起就在伪“满洲工作所”当徒弟的赵国有，尝受了十年的千辛万苦，因为没有钱，眼睁睁地看着自己的孩子没有药吃而病死。田桂英七岁的时候，就随着她父亲在汪洋大海上捕鱼、抓蟹、捞海蛎子，一年到头起早贪黑地干，总抵不住伪满时代的苛捐杂税，不得温饱。从小就给地主家收拾菜园子、补麻袋的梁军也是一个贫农“丫头”，向来受人侮辱的。
    但是在今天他（她）们都翻了身，做了国家的主人，当了全国的出色英雄，人们向他们欢呼，向他们学习，他们获得了最高的荣誉，雄伟地站在工业建设的最前面，带动着全国劳动人民前进。他们为什么能够这样呢？所有发言的代表们都说：是因为毛主席、共产党的正确领导和英勇的人民解放军艰苦斗争的结果。李永说：“没有毛主席，咱还不是个臭工人。”赵国有说：“没有党的领导，咱那能创造出新纪录？”田桂英和梁军都异口同声地讲道：“不是共产党解放了咱们，咱们妇女怎能当上司机、拖拉机手？”于松如也深深感到：“要不是毛主席和共产党的领导，我们的技术是不会发扬的。”
    英雄所以可贵，就在于他能联系群众，团结群众，发动群众。从英雄们的典型报告中，更可以认识到这个重要性。马恒昌之所以能领导他的十人小组，在一年中有八个人没出一件废品，是因为他有三个法宝：带头干活；团结所有工友；诚心把自己的本事教给别人。林口机务段工会主席杨福春说：林口机务段工会能够把全体工人群众团结在自己的周围，依靠群众力量，解决生产中的问题，改善工人福利，因此该段全部机车在二百八十八天中，安全走行一百一十四万公里，没有出过一次事故。于松如在制造透平机的汽口时，曾遇到烧焊的困难。虽然他从书本上找到“中性焰烧焊镍铬钢”的理论，但在试焊时，汽口的镍铬钢仍然张裂。当他去找有三十年烧焊经验的工人唐彦章时，唐彦章告诉他：“使用中性焰烧焊，要避免裂口，必须两面反复同时烧焊。”结果汽口果然制造成功。这是技术人员必须联系群众的有力证明。沈阳冶炼厂厂长赵岚为什么能够成为模范厂长呢？他说主要原因就是他能依靠群众，向群众学习，发动群众，解决生产中的重要问题。有了他这样一个能联系群众的模范厂长，沈阳冶炼厂遂能从过去常出事故，不能完成任务的坏厂子变成很少事故，经常超额完成任务的好工厂。“群众号”列车长李静华的报告，更是一个很好的说明。由于他们处处关心群众困难，密切联系群众，他们的列车从去年二月到今年八月，乘务运行十五万多公里，从未发生客运事故，受到广大旅客的热烈爱戴，收到群众来自各方的赞扬信件一百多封。
    我们国家在这一年当中，在工业建设上获得了辉煌成绩，今年东北公营工业生产总值将等于去年的百分之一百九十三，全国人民铁路已经恢复通车，并正常地走向发展的道路。这是全国劳动英雄们奋斗的结果。我们国家有着这样千千万万的英雄模范联系着千千万万人民，克服困难，奋勇前进；完全有信心争取工业化的美丽远景早日实现。
