How to Assess Land Yield?
　　Zuo Chuntai

According to the report on "Adjusting Tax Revenue Issues" by Bo Yibo, Deputy Director of the Central Financial and Economic Commission, at the Second Session of the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, two things must be done well in the 1950 agricultural tax work: (1) "A unified national agricultural tax law must be formulated and implemented." (2) "To make the public grain work fair and reasonable, all localities must conduct a yield survey and assessment of yields before the autumn grain collection." Because clarifying land yields is the basis for implementing the agricultural tax law and implementing reasonable burdens, and it is also the key to adjusting agricultural taxes so that they meet both the needs of the country and the requirements of farmers. Otherwise, even with a reasonable tax law, unreasonable results may occur.

However, how should the yield assessment work be carried out? China has a vast territory and complex conditions, and it is extremely difficult to do this well, especially in the newly liberated areas. Now, I will introduce some experiences from the North China region for reference.

I. Land ranking, joint village surveying and assessment, democratic deliberation, and higher-level verification are the basic methods for assessing land grades and yields.

(1) "Land Ranking"

"Land ranking" means classifying land according to quality, or, as the villagers say, ranking all the land in the village according to fertility, barrenness, good, and bad, from the top grade, second grade, to the last grade. Depending on the specific situation, there can be several grades. In dividing the grades, three different methods can be adopted as preparation for assessing yields.

1. First discuss the yield amounts between each grade of land, that is, the masses discuss how much less grain the second grade yields compared to the top grade, the third grade compared to the second grade... In this way, all the land in the village is ranked in a vertical formation from the top grade to the last grade. As long as we grasp the real yield of several pieces of land, we can initially estimate the yield of the entire village.

2. Method of converting to "medium mu": that is, selecting a certain grade of land that can represent the general yield as "medium mu," and the masses discuss the conversion ratio of other grades of land to "medium mu," such as how many "medium mu" one mu of top-grade land is equivalent to, or how many mu of last-grade land one "medium mu" is equivalent to. Some areas in the Jiangnan region adopt the conversion method of "field one, land three, marsh five, mountain ten," which also belongs to this type. In this way, as long as we grasp the yield of the "medium mu," we can calculate the yield of each grade of land, but this is a very rough method.

3. Do not discuss yield differences, nor convert to "medium mu," but after dividing the land grades, select a certain amount of representative land from each grade for typical investigation or joint village surveying and assessment to find out the perennial yield of each grade of land. This is a more commonly used and more detailed method.

Dividing land grades is an extremely meticulous and complex task, and we must break the idea of ​​being simple and afraid of trouble. Because farmers who cultivate good land generally do not want to divide too many grades, and will spread the air of "the more grades are divided, the heavier the burden will be," those who cultivate bad land, due to their deep-rooted habit of "allocating by mu," are also watching at the beginning. Therefore, propaganda work must be carried out patiently and repeatedly. At the same time, because the masses' thoughts are changing every day, in struggle, and some people may be carrying out counter-propaganda and destruction every day, it is necessary to organize sufficient propaganda firepower according to the changes in the masses' thoughts, and speak every day, everywhere, explain the principles thoroughly, and expose all rumors. The old land grades (those that have been graded or converted in the past) are also important reference materials. In the discussion, be good at inspiring the masses' disputes. Upright poor and middle peasants, those who cultivate bad land, and those who have suffered from the burden in the past are often the backbone of the discussion. Discover, cultivate, educate, and unite them as the core. At the same time, after discussing in the house, you must also go to the field to survey and compare. Good is good, bad is bad, and it is not good to lie face to face. In short, the grading work should be repeatedly discussed, verified with facts, and finalized in three announcements until the majority of the masses agree.

(2) "Joint Village Surveying and Assessment"

After the land grades of each village are roughly divided, a joint surveying and assessment committee (referred to as the joint assessment committee) can be organized from several villages to conduct joint village surveying and assessment.

The joint assessment committee is composed of district cadres stationed in the village and two to three representatives selected by each village participating in the joint assessment (regardless of the size of the village, the same number of representatives should be selected), with the district cadre as the director. Its purpose is to obtain the real, fair, and consistent standard of land yield in each village participating in the joint assessment. The main work is to jointly survey and assess the yields of each land grade in each village. The general steps and methods are:

1. Mix and group for alternate surveying. Survey village A and then village B; it is best to mix and group representatives from each village (if there is a shortage of cadres, primary school teachers can be hired to serve as recorders for each group). Each village selects standard land by inserting signs in each grade of land (when there is a lot of land in a certain grade, more standard land should be found). The joint assessment team surveys each piece of standard land in groups and alternates, and assesses the yield on the spot. However, do not just look at the standard land, but also review the plots of land without signs. The land division of the whole village should be generally viewed. If unfair land division is found, you can temporarily select good land of this grade to assess the yield, and tell the representatives of the village: "The yield of this grade of land will be determined based on this piece of land," to promote the adjustment of land grades towards rationality. If the representatives' opinions are inconsistent, do not force them to unify. The responsibility of the recorder is to faithfully record the speeches of the assessors and report the ideological situation of the assessors to the joint assessment director. The recorder can also participate in the discussion.

2. Help each other and promote each other. After surveying a village, hold a mass forum in the village and ask everyone to provide extensive opinions on the division of land grades, the selection of standard land, etc., to revise each other and seek unity. Many experiences have proved that this can give play to the leadership and supervision role of the joint assessment committee, and at the same time, it has a great influence on the masses.

3. Unify understanding, compare grades and determine yields. After several villages have been surveyed, the groups can first discuss each surveyed plot village by village (the numbers reviewed by each group can be announced for reference in the group discussion after being approved by the mass forum in each village) in order to unify understanding. Then, compare the grades by village, such as: from the overall soil quality, which village is first, which village is second, is the top grade of this village better or worse than the top grade of that village, and if it is not as good as the top grade, how about comparing the second grade. After comparing in this way, the villages and grades are linked together. As long as the yield of one or two of the most obvious pieces of land in a certain village that everyone has a deep impression of and the group's opinions are close to unanimous is first discussed and approved, the yields of other villages and other grades of land can be estimated based on the comparison of grades between villages or the difference between land grades within the village. In addition, the joint assessment committee should also calculate the total output of each village, as well as the average land per person and the average output per mu by village, and hand it over to everyone for discussion and comparison. If everyone thinks it is balanced and reasonable, the representatives of each village will take the preliminary resolution of the joint assessment committee back to the village for democratic deliberation by the masses.

Joint village surveying and assessment is one of the effective methods to overcome "village centrism." It can not only break the masses' concerns about "being afraid that their own village will report truthfully and other villages will not report truthfully, and they will suffer losses," but also solve the difficulty of the lack of cadres in the yield assessment work and a powerful weapon to promote the work. Practical experience has proved that organizing the farmer representatives selected by each village to conduct joint surveying has a greater effect on mobilizing the masses and promoting the work than the cadre's inspection work. "Everything can't be hidden from the villagers." Farmer representatives know more about soil quality than we do, and their words are more "effective." As long as they have a clear understanding of their ideology, they will make the yield fair and true.

(3) Democratic Deliberation

The yield surveyed and assessed by the joint assessment committee is submitted to the masses for democratic deliberation, discussion, and approval, and listed for public announcement. This is the last step of the yield assessment work. "A thousand hammers strike the gong, one hammer determines the sound." This is also the most important step. "Slowly lift the pot," a series of propaganda work (such as the propaganda of the reduction and exemption policy) and organizational work (cultivating backbones through various meetings, etc.) should be done. When there are different opinions on the joint assessment yield, reasons can be given to request review and reconsideration; if there is anything inappropriate between grades in the village, reasonable corrections can also be made. However, they must be reported to the joint assessment committee, and major changes must be approved by the joint assessment committee. When the majority of the masses have no objection, they should be listed for public announcement so that everyone understands.

(4) Higher-Level Verification

After the yield of a joint assessment area is determined, a register is prepared and submitted to the district and county governments for review and verification.

Some people think that since the democratic assessment has been carried out, why should it be submitted to the higher level for verification? This is because: (1) The degree of mass mobilization is different, and the ability and experience of cadres are also different. Sometimes they may be collectively concealed or blinded by the village centrism. (2) The masses have parochialism, and cadres may sometimes have parochialism. "Working there, towards the masses there," is a good example. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the higher-level government to compare this joint assessment area with that joint assessment area, this district with that district, and verify it based on facts. "Not afraid of not knowing the goods, but afraid of comparing goods." Only from the comparison can balance be achieved, and only then can those who actively report truthfully not suffer losses.

II. Mobilizing the masses, strengthening leadership, demonstrating typical examples, and promoting in waves are relatively stable methods for promoting and leading the assessment of land grades and yields.

(1) The work of assessing land and yields is related to every farmer and every piece of land, so it is necessary to mobilize the masses to make it their own business. At the same time, it is necessary to master the materials and strengthen leadership to do it well. First of all, the policy and method of investigating land and assessing yields should be fully discussed by the people's representatives' conferences or farmers' representatives' conferences at the county, district, and village levels to make a resolution. Then, elect land investigation and yield assessment committees at all levels to carry out the specific tasks. At the representatives' meeting, we must first seriously discuss and study the correct standards for assessing yields. We must link up with the actual local conditions and the examples of unbalanced burdens in the past, so that the representatives attending the meeting fully understand the basic spirit of investigating land and assessing yields and its importance. Make it clear that "one person concealing land, everyone suffers," "one village concealing yields, all villages suffer," and "poor peasants conceal a little, landlords conceal a lot," so that balancing the burden becomes the farmers' own business. Secondly, we must introduce and summarize the good and bad examples in the past yield assessment work, so that everyone fully understands that only by assessing the real yield can the burden be balanced and reasonable. We must ensure that the villages that assess the yield truthfully will not suffer losses in the burden, in order to support justice and reduce everyone's concerns and make them happy to report truthfully.

In this way, with smooth communication between the upper and lower levels, clarifying policies, the masses will treat the work of adjusting the burden as their own business and take active action. Practical experience has proved that some farmers, on the one hand, have selfish and parochial ideas in the yield assessment issue, and on the other hand, they also have the demand to oppose others' selfishness and achieve fairness and reasonableness. As long as they are good at leadership, promote the good side, and overcome the shortcomings, the government cadres will guarantee that they will never subjectively increase the output of various places (this is the most divorced from the masses), and the farmer representatives will also guarantee that they will never conceal land or falsely report output (this is also unfavorable to all farmers). Everyone will be realistic, earnestly implement, and the yield will be assessed well.

(2) Due to the shortage of cadres and lack of experience, the land investigation and yield assessment work should not adopt the practice of "universal flowering" and seeking quick results, which is "more haste, less speed." In general, we should: train cadres, demonstrate typical examples, concentrate our efforts to do a good job in one area, and then do another area or several areas, and expand outwards in a wave-like manner, which is a more stable method. At the same time, this can also ensure that production and yield assessment are not delayed. According to the experience of Hua County, Pingyuan Province, in the villages that have already assessed the output, the good farmer representatives who have emerged in the yield assessment work are organized to help neighboring villages with joint surveying and assist the government's work. As long as the leadership is effective, they are generally active, because their output has already been determined, and they do not want other villages to be untrue. In this way, using the points to drive the area and the area to drive another area, the difficulty of having too few cadres is solved, and the problem of how to combine yield assessment with production is also solved.

(3) The key to doing a good job in yield assessment lies in leadership: without strong leadership, it will not be possible to mobilize the masses well, and the work will fail—not only will it not be possible to adjust the burden well, but also new imbalances will appear. "In order to realize leadership, one must be proficient in the business." If you do not understand the business, you will not be able to point out the direction in time to lead the masses forward, which will inevitably delay the time and affect production. Moreover, because the yield assessment work is a major issue related to millions of people, it cannot be done by financial and grain cadres alone. We should obtain the cooperation of all parties, especially the help of the leadership. If we don't do it, we won't do it. If we want to do it, we must strive to do it well. Otherwise, repeated assessments and revisions will cause dissatisfaction among the farmers and increase the difficulty of the work. Therefore, we must proceed with a plan and step by step according to the objective conditions and subjective forces.

III. Act according to specific circumstances.

The above are just some experiences (and lack of experience against black land) from some old areas in North China, and they are also experiences from the plains. They may not be completely suitable for new areas or mountainous areas. Therefore, they cannot be mechanically copied and must be handled according to the specific situation. Generally, the new areas should first focus on mobilizing the masses to fight against black land and clarify the number of mu of land, and initially assess the yield if possible. For areas that used the old tax register last year, they can first be carefully sorted out, and then distributed to various townships and posted for public announcement, so that the masses can correct them based on facts. When conditions permit, we can first make a large-scale adjustment between regions by stipulating that one "tax yuan" represents a certain amount of output, and then assess the output village by village and section by section. For those areas where the land area figures surveyed last year are more accurate than the old tax register, we can carry out the anti-concealment of land movement in depth (for areas that are preparing to carry out land reform this autumn, it can be combined with the land reform preparation work), divide the land into grades according to quality, and assess the yield.

At present, in areas with approximately 280 million agricultural populations and approximately 700 million mu of land, the foundation for assessing the agricultural tax is extremely poor, or there is no foundation at all. In such a vast area, it is a very arduous task to require that the land survey and yield assessment work be done with certain achievements before the autumn grain collection this year as a preparation for the implementation of the new agricultural tax law! Some of the methods used in the old areas in the past are obviously not enough today due to the different circumstances. Therefore, how to grasp the work of assessing land yields more systematically and scientifically, we must step up our exploration from specific work.

　　怎样进行评定土地产量？
    左春台
    根据中财委薄一波副主任在人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议上关于《调整税收问题》的报告，一九五○年农业税工作要办好两件事：（一）“必须制定一个全国统一的农业税法，付诸实施。”（二）“为了把公粮工作做到公平合理的程度，各地必须在秋征前进行一次产量调查和评产量的工作。”因为搞清土地产量，乃是执行农业税法实行合理负担的基础，也是调整农业税、使之既满足国家的需要又满足农民要求的关键。否则，纵有合理的税法，也可能产生不合理的结果。
    但是，怎样进行评产量的工作呢？我国幅员辽阔，情况复杂，要办好这一件事，是极不容易的，特别是在新解放区，比较更要艰巨一些。兹先将华北区的几点经验介绍出来，以供参考。
    一、土地站队、联村勘评、民主审议、上级核定、是进行评定土地等级与产量的基本方法。
    （一）“土地站队”
    “土地站队”即将土地按质分等，照老乡们的说法，就是把全村土地按肥、瘦、好、坏排一下队，从头等地、二等地直至末等地，按具体情况有几等就划几等。在划分等级中，可采取三种不同的方法，作为评产量的准备。
    １、先讨论各级土地间产量的产额，即由群众讨论二等地比头等地、三等地比二等地……少打多少粮食，这样全村土地由头等到末等便排成纵队形式，我们只要掌握住几块地的真实产量，便可初步推算全村产量。
    ２、折合“中亩”的方法：即选择可代表一般产量的某级土地为“中亩”，由群众讨论其他各级土地与“中亩”的折合比例，如一亩头等地相当多少“中亩”、或一“中亩”相当几亩末等地。江南有些地区，采用“田一、地三、荡五、山十”的折合方法，也属于这一种。这样，我们只要掌握了“中亩”的产量，便可推算出各级土地的产量，不过这是一种很粗糙的方法。
    ３、不讨论产量差额，也不折合“中亩”，而在划分土地等级后，在各级土地中抽出一定量具有代表性的，进行典型调查或联村勘评，求出各级土地的常年产量来。这是比较常用且较为细致的一种方法。
    划分地等是一个极细致复杂的工作，要打破图简单、怕麻烦的思想。因为种好地的农民，一般不愿多划等级，且会散布“分等越多，负担越重”的空气，种坏地的，由于对“按亩摊派”的办法习染已深，开始也在观望。因此宣传工作要不厌其烦反复进行，同时，因为群众的思想，天天在变化，在斗争，而且可能有人天天在进行反宣传，在破坏，所以必须根据群众的思想变化，组织足够的宣传火力，天天讲，到处讲，把道理说得透彻，揭破一切谣言。旧的土地等级（过去分过等或进行过土地折合的）也是重要参考材料。在讨论时要善于启发群众的争论，正派的贫中农、种坏地的、过去负担上吃亏的人，往往是讨论中的骨干，要发现、培养、教育、团结他们，作为核心。同时，在屋里讨论了，还要到地里勘查对比，好就是好，坏就是坏，对着面是不好说谎话的。总之，分等的工作要做到反复讨论，印证事实，三榜定案，直至大多数群众同意为止。
    （二）“联村勘评”
    各村土地等级大体划完后，就可组织几个村的联合勘查评议委员会（简称联评会），进行联村勘评。
    联评会由驻村工作的区干部及联评各村选派代表二至三人组成（不管大小村，要选相同数目的代表），以区干部为主任，其目的在求得联评各村土地产量的真实、公平、标准一致，主要工作在联合勘查和评订各村各地等的产量，一般的步骤和方法是：
    １、混合编组轮番勘查。勘定甲村再勘乙村；各村代表顶好混合编组（如干部缺乏，可聘请小学教师担任各组纪录。）由各村在各级土地中插标选出标准地（某一级的土地很多时，要多找几块标准地），联评小组对每一块标准地，分组轮番勘查，就地评产。但不要光看标准地，不插标的地块也要审查一番，应该把全村土地大体都看一遍，发现分等不公，可临时挑选这一级土地的好地评定产量，并告诉该村代表：“就根据这一块地订这一等级土地的产量”，以促其调整土地等级走向合理，代表意见不一致，不必强求统一。记录员的责任，在忠实记录评议员的发言，并向联评主任反映评议员的思想情况。记录员也可参加讨论。
    ２、互相帮助互相推动。勘定一个村，就在该村召开群众座谈会，叫大家对该村土地等级的划分，标准地的选择等广泛提供意见，互相修正，求得一致。许多经验证明：这样才能发挥联评会的领导和督促作用，同时它给予群众的影响，也是很大的。
    ３、统一认识，比等订产。几个村都勘查完了，可先以小组为单位，就所勘地块逐村互相讨论，（各小组评议数字经各村群众座谈会通过后可公布作各小组讨论的参考），以便统一认识。然后以村为单位比等，如：从总的土质看那一村第一、那一村第二，这村头等地与那村头等地谁好谁坏，比不上头等地，比二等地怎样，这样比完以后，村与村、等与等便连锁交插起来。只要选择某一村某一二块最明显、大家印象最深、小组意见已接近一致的土地产量，先讨论通过，别村别等地的产量，则可根据村与村的比等，或村内各地等的差额推算出来。此外，联评会还要及时把各村总产量，及以村为单位的每人平均土地，每亩平均产量，试算出来，交大家讨论比较，大家认为平衡合理了，就由各村代表把联评会初步决议带回村去，交群众民主审议。
    联村勘评，是克服“村本位”的有效方法之一，不但可以打破群众“怕自己村实报了，别村不实报，自己吃亏”的顾虑，而且也是解决评产工作中干部缺乏的困难和有力推动工作的武器，实际经验证明：把各村选出的农民代表组织起来，进行联勘，这在发动群众、推动工作的作用上，比干部检查工作的效果要大的多。“凡事瞒不得当乡人”，农民代表对土质比我们懂的多，说话也“顶事”的多，只要思想搞通，是会把产量搞公平和真实的。
    （三）民主审议
    联评会勘订的产量，交群众民主审议，讨论通过，并列榜公布。这是评产工作最后的一步，“千锤打锣，一锤定音”，这也是最重要的一步，要“紧烧火，慢掀锅”，要作一系列的宣传工作（如减免政策的宣传）和组织工作（经过各种会议，培养骨干等）。对联评产量有不同意见时，可提出理由请求复查复议；本村范围内等与等之间有不合适的，也可作合理的修正。但均须报告联评会，大的变动，还须经联评会批准。群众大多数无意见时，要列榜公布，做到人人明白。
    （四）上级核定
    一个联评区的产量确定后，即缮写清册，分呈区、县政府审查核定。
    有些人以为既然民主评议了，为什么还要交上级核定呢？这是因为：（１）群众发动的程度不同，干部的能力和经验也不一样，有时可能被集体隐瞒，或被联村本位所蒙蔽，（２）群众有本位主义，干部有时也可能有本位主义，“在那里工作，便向那里的群众，”就是很好的例证。故由上级政府根据这一联评区与那一联评区比较、这一区与那一区比较、并据实加以核定是完全必要的。“不怕不识货，就怕货比货”，从比较中才能做到平衡，才能使积极实报的不吃亏。
    二、发动群众、加强领导、典型示范、波浪推动、是推动和领导评定土地等级与产量工作较为稳妥的方法。
    （一）评定土地和产量的工作，关系到每一个农民，每一块土地，所以必须发动群众，使之成为群众自己的事情，同时又必须掌握材料，加强领导，才能做好。首先要把查地评产的政策和办法，经过县、区、村各界人民代表会或农民代表会充分讨论，作成决议；再选举各级勘地评产委员会，具体执行。在代表会上，首先要认真讨论和研究评产量的正确标准。要联系当地实际情况，和过去负担不平衡的实例，使到会代表充分认识查地评产的基本精神及其重要性。讲明：“一人瞒地，众人吃亏”，“一村瞒产，众村吃亏”，“贫农瞒一点，地主瞒一片”的道理，把平衡负担变成农民自己的事。其次要介绍与总结过去评产工作中的好坏典型，使大家充分认识只有评实产量，负担才能平衡合理。必须保证评产真实的村，在负担上不致吃亏，以扶植正气，使大家减少顾虑，乐于实报。
    这样，上下通气，搞清政策，群众便会把调整负担的工作，当作自己的事情一样，积极行动起来。实际经验证明：有些农民在评产问题上，一方面有自私本位的思想，另一方面也有反对别人自私，做到公平合理的要求，只要善于领导，发扬好的一面，克服缺点的一面，政府干部保证绝不主观提高各地产量（这是最脱离群众的），农民代表也保证绝不隐瞒土地，虚报产量（这对于全体农民也是不利的）。大家都实事求是，认真执行，就会把产量评好。
    （二）由于干部不足，经验缺乏，查地评产工作，不能采取“普遍开花”急切求效的做法，这是“欲速不达”的。一般的应该：训练干部，典型示范，集中力量做好一片，再做另一片或数片，波浪式的向外展开，是较为稳妥的方法。同时这样也可以做到生产、评产两不误。根据平原省滑县的经验，在已经评过产的村庄，把在评产工作中涌现出来的好的农民代表组织起来，帮助邻村联勘并协助政府工作，只要领导有方，一般是积极的，因为他们的产量已经订好了，便不愿别的村不真实了。这样由点及面辗转运用，干部少的困难解决了，评产与生产如何结合的问题也解决了。
    （三）做好评产工作的关键在于领导：没有强有力的领导，就不能很好的发动群众，工作就会失败——不但不能很好的调整负担，且会出现新的不平衡。“为着实现领导，必须精通业务”，如果不懂业务，便不能及时指明方向领导群众前进，势必拖拉时间，影响生产。且因评产工作是关系千百万群众的大事情，不能由财粮干部单独去做，应该取得各方面的配合，特别是领导上的帮助。不做则已，要做便必须力求做好，否则屡评屡改，便会招致农民的不满，增加工作困难。因此，必须根据客观条件和主观力量，有计划有步骤的去推行。
    三、按具体情况办事。
    上面仅是华北区某些老区一些评产的点滴经验（里边还缺乏反黑地的经验）而且是平原地区的经验，对新区或山地可能不完全适合。故不可机械地搬用，必须按具体情况办事。一般新区应首先将重点放在发动群众反黑地与澄清土地亩数方面，并在可能条件下初步评定产量，凡去年利用旧赋册的地区，可先认真整理，然后分发各乡，张榜公布，让群众据实校正。条件许可时，可将一“赋元”规定代表若干产量，先作地区间的大块调整，再逐村逐段的评订产量。凡去年调查的地亩数字，其真实性已超过旧赋册的，则可深入进行反瞒田运动（今年秋后准备实行土改的地区，可与土改准备工作结合进行。）按质分等，评订产量。
    目前，约有二亿八千万农业人口的地区，约七亿亩的土地，农业税订产基础极差，或根本毫无基础，在如此广大的地区，要求在今年秋征前将土地调查和评产量的工作做出一定成绩，作为实施新农业税法的准备，是十分艰巨的工作！过去老区所用的若干方法，由于今天情况不同，显然已经感到不够了。因此，如何更有系统地更科学地去掌握评订土地产量的工作，我们必须加紧从具体工作中去探索。
