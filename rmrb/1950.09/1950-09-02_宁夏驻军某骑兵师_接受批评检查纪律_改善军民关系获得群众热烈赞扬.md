The People's Daily News: A certain cavalry division of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Ningxia accepted criticism from newspapers and the masses, conducted a comprehensive discipline inspection throughout the division, rationally resolved civil-military water disputes, and earnestly observed mass discipline, earning the love and praise of the masses. A certain battalion of a production unit of a certain regiment of the division, stationed in Gaomiao Village, Fourth District, Yongan County, when using the water from the Yangzhao Canal in the area, only cared about their own irrigation, disregarding the interests of the farmers. Furthermore, they had a very poor attitude towards the villagers because of the water dispute, causing dissatisfaction among the local masses. Xu Yan, a farmer, wrote a letter to the Ningxia Daily, criticizing the battalion. The Ningxia Daily published this letter of criticism in a prominent position on the first page of the July 2nd edition, and suggested that the local garrison make a public self-criticism. The Ningxia Daily also published letters from readers Zhang Feng from Jinji County and Zhu Yonglin and Li Jing from Lingwu County on the first page of the July 12th edition, criticizing the local garrison for competing with the people for water, violating mass discipline, individual soldiers hanging and beating the masses, and individual units raising pigs in Muslim homes. On the same day, the Ningxia Daily also published an editorial entitled "Strictly Observe Mass Discipline and Resolve Disputes over Water," pointing out that the above-mentioned undesirable phenomena must be corrected, and hoped that the relevant troops would strengthen education on loving the people among the soldiers and quickly cooperate with the local people's government and the masses to properly handle water disputes.

After receiving the criticism from newspapers and the masses, the CCP committee of the cavalry division made a decision to correct the undesirable tendencies such as violating policies and discipline. The political department of the division also issued specific instructions for implementing the decision of the division's party committee and launching a discipline inspection. The entire division immediately launched a major discipline inspection. According to incomplete statistics from the expanded meeting of the division's party committee, since the division began production, it had successively committed eighteen incidents of infringing upon human rights: four cases of beating people due to water disputes, seven cases of beating people due to urging for forage, and seven cases of beating people due to verbal disputes. In addition, individual troops and soldiers have made mistakes that violated ethnic policies.

A certain regiment of the division, where violations of discipline were more frequent, followed the instructions of the higher authorities and first convened a meeting of cadres above the platoon level to formulate a plan for checking discipline. The regiment commander and political commissar also made profound self-criticisms at the meeting. Subsequently, the cadres of each company returned to their units, convened meetings of squad leaders and platoon meetings, conveyed the resolutions of the cadre meeting, seriously studied the Ningxia Daily's editorial, and then launched a mass discipline inspection campaign in each company. The regiment also established a discipline inspection committee, led by the regiment leaders, to carry out inspection work. The regiment commander, political commissar, director of the political department, and others also personally went to the stationed area of the troops where the disputes occurred, collected opinions from the masses, and studied and resolved the problems. Each company also established discipline inspection teams to cooperate with the director of the local farmers' association and village cadres to solicit opinions from the masses door-to-door in the stationed area and conduct extensive investigations. On the 18th of last month, the regiment commander, together with county government cadres, convened a "joint symposium of the military, government, and people" in the stationed area, inviting village chiefs, village cadres, local residents, and Ahongs. The director of the regiment's political department was responsible for convening a "Muslim symposium," and each company universally convened "landlord symposiums" to widely solicit opinions from the masses, apologize to the masses, and discuss ways to improve civil-military relations. At various meetings, the masses unanimously reflected that civil-military relations were generally very good, especially in production, where the army provided great help to the masses in terms of labor and livestock, which was unanimously praised by the masses. However, individual cadres and soldiers, due to insufficient education, and also in the situation of decentralized production in the army, were prone to violating mass discipline (mainly competing with the people for water and not being respectful enough of Muslim customs). Some of the masses also reviewed their past shortcomings towards the army. Regarding improving civil-military relations, everyone agreed that the military and the people should maintain close contact in the future and raise any opinions at any time. Regarding respecting Muslim customs, the troops, in addition to strengthening policy education, also planned to invite Ahongs to explain Muslim customs, so as to avoid soldiers inadvertently violating policies. In addition, the local people's government also reviewed its own failure to fulfill its responsibilities in certain aspects, which led to civil-military disputes.

The regiment, in addition to requiring comrades who directly committed errors to make public self-criticisms and admit their mistakes to the masses, also gave appropriate criticisms and punishments according to the seriousness of the circumstances. It was also decided that in future elections of production models, compliance with policies and discipline would be one of the important conditions. The regiment also organized a compensation and apology team to compensate and apologize to each household that suffered losses. Regarding the issue of water use, a water conservancy management committee was established on July 16th, with the principle of "benefit both the military and the people, prioritizing the people over the military," to handle water use issues, and specific regulations were made for the water release time for the military and the people.

After the cavalry division conducted this major discipline inspection and rationally resolved all existing problems between the military and civilians, the awareness of the villagers in the stationed area was also greatly improved. Every household praised the excellent qualities of their army and their revolutionary style of considering the interests of the people in everything. For example, Ahong Yang Xuezhi said: "In the past, during the era of bandit armies, soldiers beat and scolded people, and who dared to say no!? Today, our people's army openly admits its mistakes and makes public self-criticisms even if it makes a small mistake. Isn't this a true democratic style?" Farmer Zhang Zhu said: "It is also wrong for us ordinary people to be unreasonable in some places. We must also correct ourselves in the future so that the military and the people can help each other and be like a family." The Ningxia Daily also published an editorial on August 4th, praising the division's spirit of daring to accept criticism and correct mistakes, and emphasized that as long as the military, government, and people maintain close contact, all problems can be solved easily.

　　宁夏驻军某骑兵师
    接受批评检查纪律
    改善军民关系获得群众热烈赞扬
    【本报讯】群众日报消息：驻宁夏人民解放军骑兵某师，接受报纸及群众的批评，进行全师纪律大检查，合理解决军民用水纠纷，认真遵守群众纪律，得到群众的爱戴与赞扬。该师某团驻永宁县四区一乡高庙村生产部队某营，在使用驻地杨沼渠渠水时，只顾自己灌溉，不顾农民利益，并因与民争水，对老乡态度非常不好，引起当地群众不满。农民许彦为此特写信给宁夏日报，对该营提出批评。宁夏日报将这封批评信刊登在七月二日该报第一版的显著地位上，并建议当地驻军，作公开检讨。宁夏日报并在七月十二日该报第一版刊载金积县读者张风及灵武县读者朱永林、李靖等的信，批评当地驻军与民争水，违犯群众纪律，个别战士吊、打群众，个别单位在回民家中养猪等行为。宁夏日报同日并以《严格遵守群众纪律解决与民争水纠纷》为题，发表社论，指出上述不良现象必须纠正，希望有关各部队一方面对战士加强爱民教育，同时应迅速协同当地人民政府和群众妥善处理争水纠纷。
    该骑兵师接到报纸及群众的批评意见后，即由该师中共党委作出纠正违犯政策纪律等不良倾向的决定，师政治部并发出执行师党委决定展开纪律检查的具体指示。全师即展开纪律大检查。据该师党委扩大会上的不完全统计，该师自开始生产以来，先后发生十八次侵犯人权事件：因争夺水利而打人者四件，因催草料而打人者七件，为口角而打人者七件。此外个别部队个别战士还有违犯民族政策的错误行为。
    违犯纪律现象较多的该师某团，依据上级指示，首先召开了排以上的干部会议，订出了检查纪律的计划。该团团长和政委并在会上作了深刻的检讨。接着各连队干部回本部后，召开了班长联席会、排务会，传达干部会议决议，认真学习宁夏日报的社论，然后在各连队普遍展开群众性的检查纪律运动。该团并成立了纪律检查委员会，由团首长领导进行检查工作。该团团长、政委、政治处主任等并亲赴发生纠纷的部队驻地，搜集群众意见，研究、解决问题。各连亦成立纪律检查小组，协同当地农会主任及乡村干部，在驻地挨门逐户征求群众意见，广泛进行调查。上月十八日，该团团长协同县府干部在驻地召集各乡长、乡村干部及当地居民、阿訇等举行了“军政民联合座谈会”，该团政治部主任负责召开“回民座谈会”，各连普遍召开“房东座谈会”，广泛征求群众意见，向群众道歉，并座谈改进军民关系办法。在各种会上，群众一致反映：军民关系一般都是很好的，特别是在生产上，军队对群众的劳畜力帮助很大，获得群众一致赞扬。但是个别干部和战士，因教育不够，又在军队分散生产的情况下，容易违犯群众纪律（主要是与民争用水以及对回民风俗习惯不够尊重。）部分群众对过去对不起军队的地方，也作了检讨。关于改进军民关系，大家一致认为：以后军民应密切联系，彼此有意见随时提出。关于尊重回民风俗习惯方面，部队除加强政策教育外，并准备请阿訇讲解回民风俗习惯，以免战士们无意中违犯政策。此外当地人民政府亦检讨了自己对某些方面未尽到责任，致酿成军民纠纷。
    该团对直接犯错误的同志，除要他们自己作公开检讨，向群众承认错误外，并分别情节轻重，给以适当的批评和处分。并决定在今后选举生产模范时，将遵守政策、纪律作为重要条件之一。该团并组织了赔偿道歉组，向受损失各户进行赔偿道歉。关于用水问题，七月十六日成立水利管理委员会，以“军民两利，先民后军”为原则，处理用水问题，并具体规定军民放水时间。
    该骑兵师经过此次纪律大检查，并合理解决一切军民间存在的问题后，使驻地老乡觉悟也大大提高，家家户户称赞自己军队的优良品质和处处为人民利益打算的革命作风。如阿訇杨学智说：“过去马匪时期军队打人骂人，谁敢说个不字！？今天咱们人民的军队犯了一点错误，便公开承认错误，公开检讨，难道不是真正的民主作风吗？”农民张柱说：“我们老百姓有的地方不讲理，也是不对的。以后我们也要改正，使军民做到互相帮助，和一家人一样。”宁夏日报亦于八月四日发表社论，对于该师勇于接受批评改正错误的精神，备加赞扬，并着重指出：只要军、政、民密切联系，一切问题都可迎刃而解。
