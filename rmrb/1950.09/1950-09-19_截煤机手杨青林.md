　　Coal Cutting Machine Operator Yang Qinglin

　　Yang Qinglin was originally a mechanical and electrical worker at the No. 12 Pit of the Nanshan Coal Mine in Hegang. Before the Hegang Coal Mine's production became mechanized, the leadership sent Yang Qinglin to a coal cutting machine training class to cultivate technical workers. In June of this year, when the No. 149 large workface of Nanshan No. 12 Pit began to implement mechanized coal mining, there was a great shortage of coal cutting machine operators. Yang Qinglin requested to leave his mechanical and electrical work in the pit and go down to work as a coal cutting machine operator in No. 149, which was approved by the leadership.

　　The workers had various understandings of mechanized coal mining. Some workers doubted the coal cutting machine, thinking: "You can use machines for other work, but can you use machines for coal mining?" Most workers did not have a correct assessment of the coal cutting machine, but they all eagerly hoped that the coal cutting machine could exert amazing effectiveness!

　　When coal mining began with the coal cutting machine, due to the lack of skill of the coal cutting machine operators, the machine constantly had accidents, and the efficiency was very low, only cutting three or four meters per hour, which did not meet the specified output. The workers were very dissatisfied, and some began to say strange things: "What kind of mechanization is this? It's not as good as a pickaxe!" Some workers ridiculed the coal cutting machine operators, saying: "If you can't do it, don't pretend." As a result, some coal cutting machine operators developed feelings of discouragement and disappointment. They thought: "We can dig coal just as well as one person, why bother enduring hardship and being scolded?" When Yang Qinglin returned home, his uncle also said to him: "Why bother enduring hardship and not being appreciated? You should go back to the pit and do mechanical and electrical work!" But he was not discouraged and went to the leaders of the Party and the trade union to study ways to overcome the shortcomings. The Party and the trade union taught him to contact the masses more and think of more ways to overcome difficulties.

　　He first called a meeting of the coal cutting machine operators of the three shifts, reviewed the work, and studied the causes of machine failures. Then, he concentrated on studying methods to overcome accidents and exert mechanical efficiency. After work, he went to the No. 150 large workface to learn working methods from experienced coal cutting machine operators. Through his active study, he accepted other people's experiences and created many methods. Finally, in late June, he gradually eliminated accidents and exerted the machine's effectiveness, increasing the cutting speed from three or four meters per hour to twenty meters; soon, it was increased to thirty-five meters, reaching the normal production rate. Yang Qinglin also created a record of fifty meters per hour, exceeding the production task. However, he was not satisfied with his achievements. After finishing his machine work, he took the initiative to help other workers, and he came up with a method of cutting a groove in the shift, leaving it for the next shift to work on. From late June to the present, his machine has not had a single accident.

　　At the Hegang Mining Bureau's conference in July to reward advanced producers, he received a special award from the entire bureau.

　　截煤机手杨青林
    马泰来
    杨青林原是鹤岗煤矿南山矿十二坑的机电工人。在鹤岗煤矿生产走向机械化前，领导上为了培养技术工人，把杨青林送到截煤机训练班学习。今年六月南山十二坑一四九大掌子开始实行机械化采煤时，截煤机手很缺乏。杨青林就要求脱离了坑上的机电工作，下坑作一四九的截煤机手，得到领导上的同意。
    工友们对机械化采煤存在着各种不同的认识，有的工友对截煤机发生怀疑，认为：“干别的活可以使机器，采煤还能使机器？”大部分工友对截煤机都没有正确的估计，但都热望截煤机能发挥惊人的效力！
    开始用截煤机采煤时，由于截煤机手们的技术不熟练，机器不断的出事故，效率也很低，每小时仅能割三四米，达不到规定产量。工友们都很不满意，有的就说起怪话来：“这叫啥机械化，还不如镐头！”有的工友讽刺截煤机手说：“要不能干，就别装蒜。”这样，有的截煤机手就产生了灰心失望的心理，他们想：“我们刨煤也顶一个人，何必挨着累还受骂呢？”杨青林回到家里，他的伯父也对他说：“你何必挨累不讨好，还是回坑上干机电去吧！”但是他并不灰心，去找党和工会的领导人研究克服缺点的办法。党和工会则教他多联系群众，多想办法去克服困难。
    他首先找三个班的截煤机手开会，检讨了工作，研究了机器发生故障的原因后，就集中精力研究克服事故发挥机械效能的方法。下班后，他到一五○大掌子向有经验的截煤机手学习工作方法。在他积极的钻研下，接受了别人的经验，并且创造出许多办法。终于在六月下旬，逐渐消灭了事故，发挥了机器效能，由每小时割三四米提高到二十米；不久又提高到三十五米，达到了正常生产率。杨青林还曾创造出一小时五十米的最高纪录，超过了生产任务。但他不因成绩而感到满足，当他开完机器之后，主动地帮助其他工友干活，并且想出上班割出槽，留给下班去干的办法。从六月下旬到现在，他的机器没发生过一次事故。
    在七月份鹤岗矿务局奖励生产先进者大会上，他得到了全局的特等奖励。
