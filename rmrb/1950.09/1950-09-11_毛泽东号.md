　　Mao Zedong Locomotive (Serialized Medium-Length Novel)
 　　by Ding Kexin and Qing Ying
　　Twenty-Two, “What are you reading in the dead of night?”
　　Guo Shude took the old hero outside to talk, originally intending to inquire in detail about the rules, regulations, and shift handover procedures on the locomotive, and how to start working in the future, etc. However, the old hero had something on his mind and only talked about his own affairs. He said:
　　“Chief Guo, you probably already know that I am not capable enough and don’t know how to lead. Your arrival is just right, I should get off the locomotive.”
　　Guo Shude smiled and said:
　　“It’s not like that. The section asked me to come to help with the work. The ‘Mao Zedong Locomotive’ is a model of the responsibility system. You are the driver chief. I have only been a driver for a short time, and I need to learn from you in all aspects of technology. Who will lead this locomotive if you leave? Don't think like that! Let's study more if there are any difficulties and help each other solve them.”
　　Just as they were talking, Wang Qingquan and Yang Daofang came, angrily and anxiously telling Guo Shude what Lao Shang and Lao Zheng had just said, and also said:
　　“We can’t work on this locomotive. They know more than us, and we can’t lead them.”
　　“Who asked you to lead them?” Guo Shude said, “Because this locomotive is not united and there are some ideological problems, the organization asked us to come to help everyone make common progress and do a better job of the responsibility system. If they know more, we should learn more from them; we should take the lead in our work and work harder. Don't take any improper words to heart, and we will slowly unite with everyone.”
　　Wang Qingquan said with little confidence:
　　“Let’s try it, anyway, we will definitely do more work.”
　　Yang Daofang also continued:
　　“Give me more of the physical work, but don’t ask me to talk about politics. I don’t have the education, and I really can’t argue with them.”
　　The old hero was also a little worried for them as he listened.
　　Guo Shude originally planned to divide the two of them into two shifts, but now he considered that it would be necessary to wait a while, let everyone see each other and understand each other. At the end, he encouraged the two young men:
　　“Work hard, don’t be discouraged, the first shot must be a success.”
　　Guo Shude didn't care on the surface, but he felt embarrassed in his heart. When he returned home at night, he tossed and turned and couldn't fall asleep. After turning off the light, he sat up again and turned on the light.
　　His wife asked sleepily:
　　“What are you doing?”
　　“I’m going to read a book for a while.”
　　“Hey, what kind of book are you reading in the dead of night?” His wife turned over and faced the wall to sleep.
　　He opened his diary. This worn-out notebook had been used since shortly after liberation. He recorded everything in the past two years, recorded a lot, and it was also very messy:
　　Recording the intense work of hauling military vehicles just after liberation;
　　Recording the situation of being trained in the workers' training class;
　　Recording the many revolutionary truths told by comrades in the railway work team;
　　Recording the excited and excited mood during the period of joining the Party and the determination to sacrifice and struggle;
　　Recording the detailed work experience on the “Zhu De Locomotive.”…
　　What attracted him the most was the work record on the "Zhu De Locomotive". He flipped through it again and again, looked at it again and again, and one thing after another, one character after another turned in his mind. Closing the diary, he seemed to have unintentionally derived a summary of the experience of that period of work: To do a good job, you must understand others and help others; be kind and humble; everyone should think of ways and come up with ideas; don't be conservative in technical aspects, teach what you know to others, and learn what you don't know from others; don't make opinions if someone is wrong, talk slowly, criticize well…
　　In fact, these were all his personal experiences, and he had already done them, but after reading the diary again, he unintentionally summarized it, and it seemed to be more organized, with support, and with strength. When he thought of what Representative Zhang and the branch secretary had said to him when he got on the locomotive, saying that this was a glorious task given to him by the Party, and that they believed he could complete this task, he felt even more that as long as he was careful and worked hard, and with the leadership and help of Representative Zhang and the branch secretary, there would be a way, and the difficulties would not be great.
　　He put the diary in his pocket as if it were a treasure, turned off the light and went to sleep; it turned out that he had been reading the diary for a long time, and his upper body was already ice cold. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作
  二十二、“深更半夜看什么书？”
    郭树德找老英雄到外面去谈话，本想详细打问一下车上的制度、规章、交接班情形，今后怎样着手工作等等，可是老英雄心里有事，光说他自己的事情，他说：
    “郭大车，你大概已经知道，我能力不够，不会领导，你来的正好，我该下车了。”
    郭树德笑了笑说：
    “不是这样，段上叫我来，是来帮助工作。‘毛泽东号’是负责制的模范，你是司机长，我刚当司机不久，技术各方面正要向你学习，你离了这车让谁领导？你可别这样想！有什么困难咱们多研究，互相帮助解决。”
    正说着，王清权和杨道芳找来了，又生气又着急地把刚才老商、老郑说的话告诉了郭树德，还说：
    “咱在这车上可干不了，人家比咱还懂的多，咱可领导不了人家。”
    “谁叫你们去领导人家呢？”郭树德说：“因为这车上不团结，思想方面有些问题，组织上叫咱们来帮助大家共同进步，把负责制做得更好。人家懂的多，咱们就得多向人家学习；在工作上咱们处处带头，多辛苦点，听到不三不四的话，不要放在心上，慢慢的就会和大家团结起来的。”
    王清权信心不大地说：
    “试试看吧，反正咱们一定多干活。”
    杨道芳也接着说：
    “卖力气的活多分给我，讲政治可别叫我做，咱没有文化，真讲不过人家。”
    老英雄听着也有点替他们发愁。
    郭树德原打算把他二人分给两个班，现在考虑需要过一时期再说，让大家互相看看，互相了解了解。临末他勉励两个青年道：
    “好好干吧，可不能灰心，头一炮要打响。”
    郭树德表面上不在乎，心里却感到为难，晚上回到家里，翻来覆去睡不着觉。熄了灯，又坐起来把灯开开。
    老婆迷迷糊糊地问：
    “你干什么？”
    “我看一会书。”
    “嗨，深更半夜看的什么书？”老婆翻了个身，脸朝着墙睡去了。
    他翻开日记本。这个破本子解放不久就用上了，两年来什么也记，记的很多，也很乱：
    记着刚解放时拉军用车的紧张工作；
    记着在工人训练班受训的情形；
    记着铁路工作队同志讲的许多革命道理；
    记着入党时期兴奋激动的心情和牺牲奋斗的决心；
    记着在“朱德号”详细的工作经过。……
    最吸引他的是在“朱德号”的工作记录。他翻了又翻，看了又看，一件件事情一个个人物在他脑子里转。合上日记本，他无意中似乎得出了那一段工作的经验总结：要把工作做好，必须了解别人，帮助别人；和气，虚心；大家想办法，出主意；技术方面不要保守，懂的要教给人家，不懂的要向人学习；谁有不对也不要闹意见，慢慢谈，好好批评，……
    其实这些都是他的切身经验，现在已经照着做了，但再看了看日记本，无意中总结了一下，似乎就更加条理分明，有了依傍，有了支持，有了力量。再一想起临上车时张代表和支部书记跟他谈的话，说这是党给他的光荣任务，相信他能完成这个任务，他就更加觉得只要自己细心努力，上面又有张代表和支部书记他们的领导和帮助，有办法的，困难不大。
    他把日记本当作珍宝似的放进口袋里，关了灯睡下；原来他看日记的工夫不短，上身已冻的冰凉了。（附图片）
