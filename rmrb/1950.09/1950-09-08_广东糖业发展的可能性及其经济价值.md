The warm climate, fertile soil, and abundant rainfall in Guangdong Province are suitable for the growth of subtropical crops, making sugarcane a major specialty crop in the province. Based on the distribution of sugarcane fields, the province can be divided into five sugar industry regions: (1) the Pearl River Delta, (2) the North River Basin, (3) the Han River Basin, (4) Hainan Island, and (5) the Leizhou Peninsula. Among these five regions, the Pearl River Delta has the most extensive cultivation and a relatively developed sugar manufacturing industry. Since 1934, Guangdong has successively established six mechanical sugar factories, four of which were built in the Pearl River Delta region. Due to the destruction by the Japanese invaders during the War of Resistance and the sabotage by the reactionaries during their retreat, only the Dongguan and Shunde factories remain, along with more than 30 private semi-mechanized sugar factories. During the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island, they actively plundered our economic resources and planned to develop the sugar industry, dispatching Meiji Sugar Co., Ltd., Nankoku Industries Co., Ltd., and others to prepare for the construction of sugar factories, but this was halted due to their defeat in the war. The Leizhou Peninsula currently only has handicraft-style earthen sugar houses, and its sugar production is far less than that of the Pearl River Delta.

The prominent development of the Pearl River Delta is due to its superior geographical conditions. The three major rivers of Guangdong, the North River, the East River, and the West River, all converge here and flow into the sea, resulting in a thick accumulation of fertile river sediment. Furthermore, the intricate network of river branches facilitates water transport. A foreign sugarcane breeding expert once praised it as the world's most superior sugarcane breeding area. From a natural perspective, this may not be an overstatement. However, the potential conflict between sugar and rice should also be considered. (The competition between sugarcane and rice in Taiwan has seriously affected the development and recovery of the sugar industry there.) Guangdong has always been a grain-deficient province, especially the densely populated Pearl River Delta, where the annual grain shortage is far greater than in other regions. Therefore, further development of the sugar industry in Guangdong should be based on the principle of not affecting the local grain supply. The Pearl River Delta currently has approximately 210,000 mu of sugarcane fields. According to this year's survey, the average yield per mu is 50 dan, resulting in a total harvest of over 10 million dan of sugarcane. This can only meet about 50% of the crushing capacity required by both public and private sugar factories in the region operating for 100 days. Furthermore, a sugar factory in Shitou Town, Panyu County, which was dismantled and relocated from Taiwan before liberation, is being planned for construction. Once completed and put into operation, the sugarcane supply shortage will be even greater. Therefore, to solve the raw material problem, one of two methods must be chosen: first, increase the yield of sugarcane per mu; second, increase the area of sugarcane fields. The first method should be pursued. Before the war, the highest yield per mu in this region reached 140 dan. It is said that a sugarcane breeding farm in Zhongshan County in the region has even reached over 350 dan per mu, indicating that increasing the yield is entirely possible. Moreover, it is possible to increase the sugarcane yield per mu to over 100 dan in almost all parts of Guangdong Province. Some areas may even surpass the Pearl River Delta. Therefore, the first method is not limited to the Pearl River Delta. Regarding the second method, the current land utilization situation in the region makes it highly unlikely, because based on the production capacity of existing sugar factories in the region, the area of sugarcane fields needs to be expanded by more than double to ensure an adequate sugarcane supply, but the arable land in the region has already been utilized to near its maximum extent.

As for the North River Basin and the Han River Basin, the arable land has also been fully developed, and the transportation conditions are far inferior to those of the Pearl River Delta. From a geographical point of view, Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula are more ideal sugar industry regions for future sugar industry construction in Guangdong.

The climate on Hainan Island is slightly hotter than that of the Pearl River Delta, with an average annual rainfall of 8.4 inches. The total area of the island is approximately 3,429,129 hectares, and the estimated area of sugarcane fields is 6,500 hectares. The sugarcane areas are mostly distributed in the plains of the northeast and northwest parts of the island. It is estimated that there are still approximately 20% of the island's total area (approximately 685,826 hectares) of undeveloped wasteland that can be utilized. Although much of it is hilly, the slopes are not steep, and water resources are abundant. With some construction and guidance, there is no need to worry about depletion. If one-third of this vast wasteland (i.e., 228,600 hectares) is developed, with a sugar production of 4.5 tons per hectare (assuming a sugarcane yield of 60 dan per mu and a sugar extraction rate of 10%), approximately 1,000,000 tons of sugar can be produced, which can accommodate 60 sugar factories with a daily crushing capacity of 1,000 tons.

The soil and climate of the Leizhou Peninsula are suitable for sugarcane cultivation, and its superior conditions are no less than those of the Pearl River Delta and Hainan Island. The coastal counties of Haikang and Xuwen in the area have vast stretches of fertile land with black soil layers up to three to four feet thick, mostly undeveloped virgin land. The vast plains are ideal for mechanized farming. According to the construction plan of the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government in 1948, the estimated area for sugarcane planting in Xuwen alone was 1,233,015 mu, and in Haikang it was 2,211,600 mu. Furthermore, it is estimated that Xuwen has 250,000 mu of wasteland. If this is used for sugarcane planting, five sugar factories with a daily crushing capacity of 1,000 tons can be established.

Our country is an agricultural nation, and the new China's economic construction will guide agriculture towards industrialization. The sugar industry is essentially agricultural processing, but because raw materials cannot be stored for long periods, sugar industry construction must consider the limitations of regional natural conditions. Guangdong sugarcane sugar has always been an important resource of the province and is also a sugar-producing area in mainland China with superior natural conditions. It already has a good foundation for a modern sugar industry. If it can be fully developed, the output from Hainan Island alone will be sufficient to meet the national consumption needs. Unfortunately, the reactionary government officials in charge of the sugar industry in the past used the establishment of factories as a cover for large-scale smuggling of foreign sugar for profit (during Chen Jitang's rule in Guangdong, Guangdong sugar was known as "smokeless sugar," meaning that sugar was sold before the factory chimneys even started smoking). They also implemented strict controls, colluding with private merchants to oppress private sugar factories and sugarcane farmers. The Guangdong sugar industry was subjected to competition from the dumping of foreign sugar, oppression by bureaucratic capital, and exploitation by sugarcane merchants. Under such heavy suppression and blows, it declined sharply. The highest sugar production in the past reached 189,280 metric tons (1936), while the production in 1949 was less than half of that.

Due to the superior geographical conditions in Guangdong, sugarcane planting is far more profitable than rice cultivation. Currently, the public sugar factories in Guangdong adopt a sugar-sharing system for purchasing raw materials. Sugar factories near the sugarcane areas share sugar at a ratio of 43% for the factory and 57% for the sugarcane farmers. Sugar factories further away from the sugarcane areas share at a ratio of 40% for the factory and 60% for the sugarcane farmers. Sugarcane farmers receive an average of 58.5%. This year, the average yield of sugarcane per mu is 4,000 jin (this is the lowest yield). With a sugar extraction rate of 9.5%, each mu yields 380 jin of sugar. Sugarcane farmers receive 220 jin. Based on the current market price of grain and sugar, each mu of sugarcane field yields approximately 1,100 jin of rice annually. However, the average annual yield of rice fields per mu in Guangdong is only 265 jin. Even in the most productive Pearl River Delta, the annual yield per mu is only about 500 jin of rice. Five hundred jin of rice milled into rice kernels, calculated at 70%, means that each mu of rice field produces only 350 jin of rice kernels per year. Comparing the two, sugarcane planting is much more profitable than rice cultivation. However, this year, due to the reduction in domestic sugar production, the interruption of sugar supply from Taiwan due to the lack of liberation, and the excess of demand over supply in the market, sugar prices have risen, so the current sugar-grain price ratio is not normal. A suitable sugar-grain price ratio should generally be maintained at one jin of sugar for two jin of rice. Even based on this price ratio, sugarcane planting is more profitable than rice cultivation. In addition, two points are worth noting: First, sugarcane producing areas in Guangdong are not limited to the Pearl River Delta, and land used for sugarcane planting may not yield 500 jin of rice kernels per mu every year if it is converted to rice cultivation. Second, conversely, 4,000 jin of sugarcane per mu of sugarcane field is the lowest yield. Before the war, the yield of sugarcane fields per mu reached 10,000 jin, which could be used to extract 950 jin of sugar. Therefore, if the pre-war yield can be restored, then the sugar received by sugarcane farmers, even if calculated at one jin of sugar for one jin of rice, will still be more profitable than rice cultivation. The government agricultural agencies are actively planning to supply high-quality sugarcane varieties and guide sugarcane farmers to improve cultivation methods. There should be no difficulty in gradually restoring the pre-war sugarcane yield per mu in the future.

Our country has a vast territory, and grain can be planted everywhere, but not everywhere is suitable for planting sugar raw materials. Since sugarcane planting in Guangdong is more profitable than rice cultivation, it is worth considering selecting the most suitable areas, expanding the area of sugarcane fields, and providing sugar factories with sufficient raw materials to enable them to recover and develop.

Based on the above analysis, it can be imagined that the sugar industry has the possibility of development in Guangdong and is economically valuable in rural areas. In the past, the record of per capita sugar consumption in our country was about 2 kilograms per year, with a national consumption of about 1 million tons per year. In the future, as the living standards of farmers improve, the total consumption will be more than this, and the national sugar production (including Taiwan) will not be enough to meet the supply. How to develop the Guangdong sugar industry in a planned and step-by-step manner is worthy of attention.

　　广东糖业发展的可能性及其经济价值
　 陈焚
　 广东气候温暖，土壤肥沃，雨量充沛，适宜于亚热带性农作物的成长，故广东的甘蔗为省内主要的特种作物。全省依蔗田面积的分布，计可分为五个糖业区：（一）珠江三角洲，（二）北江流域、（三）韩江流域、（四）海南岛、（五）雷州半岛。此五区中以珠江三角洲栽培为最广，制糖工业也较为发达。一九三四年起，广东曾先后建立机械制糖厂六家，其中四家即建立在珠江三角洲区内。由于抗战期间遭日敌摧残，和反动派撤走时破坏，现仅存东莞顺德两家，另有私营的半机械制糖厂三十余家。海南岛在日寇占据期间，积极搜刮我经济资源，曾计划开发糖业，派遣明治制糖株式会社，南国产业株式会社等筹备建设糖厂，后因战争失败而中止。雷州半岛现仅有手工业式的土糖房，产糖量远不及珠江三角洲。
　 珠江三角洲的突出发展，有它优越的地理条件，广东三大主要河流的北江、东江、西江均经此汇流入海，肥沃的河流沉淀物积聚甚厚，且河叉交错，水运极便，一位外国甘蔗育种专家曾誉为世界最优越的甘蔗繁殖区。从自然条件来看，也许并非过誉。但也应该考虑到可能发生的糖米之争。（台湾蔗稻争作曾严重影响到台湾糖业的发展与恢复。）广东向为缺粮省份，尤其珠江三角洲人口稠密，每年缺粮数额远在其他各区之上，故广东糖业进一步开拓，应以不影响当地粮食供应为原则。珠江三角洲全区现有蔗田约二十一万亩，依照本年度调查，每亩产蔗以五十担计算，共可收获甘蔗一千万担以上，以之供应全区公私营各糖厂开榨一百天的需要，仅能达到压榨能力百分之五十左右。尚有在解放前由台湾拆迁该区番禺县市头的糖厂，正在计划兴建，一旦竣工开榨，则甘蔗供应的差额更大，因此，为了解决原料问题，必须从两个办法中择一而行：第一是提高甘蔗每亩产量；第二是增加蔗田的面积。第一个办法是应该做的。该区战前每亩产量，最高到达一百四十担，听说在该区的中山县的一个甘蔗繁殖场，且曾到达三百五十担以上（每一市亩），这说明要提高产量是完全有可能的，并且在广东要提高甘蔗每亩产量至一百担以上，差不多全省都有这个可能。有些地区还可以超过珠江三角洲，因此，第一个办法也不限于在珠江三角洲才能办到。第二个办法，就该区土地利用情形来说，目前可能性很小，因为从该区现有各糖厂生产能力来看，尚须拓充蔗田面积一倍以上，才能保证甘蔗供应不缺，但该区可耕地已利用至接近最高的程度。
　 至于北江流域与韩江流域可耕地，也已充分开发，且运输条件，远不如珠江三角洲。今后建设广东糖业，以地理观点而论，则海南岛与雷州半岛为更理想的糖业区。
　 海南岛气候较珠江三角洲稍热，常年雨量平均为八·四英寸，全岛总面积约三、四二九、一二九公顷，蔗田面积据估计为六千五百公顷。蔗区多分布在该岛的东北与西北部平原地带，据估计尚有可资开发之荒地约占全岛总面积百分之二十（约六八五、八二六公顷），其中虽多丘陵地带，但坡度不大，且水源丰富，只要稍加兴修引导，就不虞枯竭了。假使将这片广大的荒地三分之一（即二二八、六○○公顷）加以开发，以每公顷产糖四吨半计算（假定每亩产蔗六十担，出糖率百分之十）约可产糖一、○○○、○○○吨，可容纳每日压榨能力一千吨的糖厂六十家。
　 雷州半岛土壤气候适合于栽培甘蔗，其优越条件，较之珠江三角洲及海南岛毫无逊色，该区沿海的海康，徐闻等县，沃野千里，黑色土层厚达三、四尺，多为未开发的处女地，且平原广漠，极宜于使用机械农具的垦殖，据一九四八年伪广东省府建设计划，估计徐闻一地可植蔗面积为一、二三三、○一五亩，海康一地为二、二一一、六○○亩，另据估计徐闻有荒地二十五万亩，如以之栽植甘蔗，可建立每日压榨力一千吨糖厂五家。
　 我国为一农业国家，新中国经济建设将引导农业逐渐走向工业化。糖业本属农产加工，但由于原料不能趸存，故糖业建设不得不考虑区域的自然条件的限制。广东蔗糖向为该省的重要资源，也是我国大陆上具备优越自然条件的产糖区域，且已略具良好的新式糖业基础，倘能充分开发，仅海南岛一地产量，就足供全国消费的需要。惜过去主管糖业的反动政府官僚，以开厂为掩护，大量走私输入外糖牟利，（陈济棠统治广东期间，广东糖有“无烟糖”之称，意谓糖厂烟囱尚未冒烟，即有糖出售。）并施行严格管制，勾结私商，压迫私营糖厂及蔗农；广东糖业，外受洋糖倾销竞争，内被官僚资本压迫，加以遭受蔗商中间剥削，在这样重重的排挤与打击下，遂至一蹶不振。过去糖产量最高的一年曾达一八九、二八○公吨（一九三六），而一九四九年的产量还不及半数。
　 广东由于地理条件的优越，植蔗的利益远优于种稻。目前广东的公营糖厂采办原料采用分糖制，靠近蔗区的糖厂分糖比例为厂方占百分之四十三，蔗农占百分之五十七；糖厂离蔗区较远的比例为厂方占百分之四十，蔗农占百分之六十；蔗农平均占百分之五十八·五。今年每亩蔗田平均产蔗四千斤（这是最低的产量），以产糖率百分之九·五计算，每亩产糖三百八十斤，蔗农分得二百二十斤，照目前粮糖市价计算，每亩蔗田每年收获约折合大米一千一百斤。但广东的稻田每年每亩平均仅收获稻子二百六十五斤；产量最富的珠江三角洲，每亩每年亦仅产稻五百斤左右，五百斤稻子碾成大米，以七成计算，那么每亩稻田每年产大米不过三百五十斤。两者相较，种蔗比种稻要有利得多。不过今年因为国内产糖量缩减，台湾未解放，台糖来源断绝，市场上供不应求，刺激糖价上涨，因此目前的糖粮比价并不是正常的。适当的糖粮比价大体上应保持一斤糖换两斤米，就照这个比价折算，也是种蔗利益优于种稻。此外，还有两点是值得注意的：第一，广东产蔗区不仅限于珠江三角洲，种蔗的土地，如改种水稻，并非每年每亩都能产五百斤稻子；第二，相反的每亩蔗田产蔗四千斤却是最低的产量。战前每亩蔗田产量曾达一万斤，可以榨糖九百五十斤，因此如能恢复战前产量，那么蔗农所分得的糖，纵以一斤糖换一斤米计算，其利益亦优于种稻。现政府农业机关已积极进行筹划供给优良蔗种，并指导蔗农改良栽培方法，今后逐渐恢复战前每亩产蔗量，当不致有什么困难。
　 我国幅员广大，随地均可种植粮食，但未必随地都可栽植制糖原料。广东植蔗利益既较种稻为优厚，选择最适宜的地区，推广蔗田的面积，供给糖厂以充分的原料，使其恢复和发展，是值得加以考虑的。
　 依据上面的分析，就可想见糖业在广东有发展的可能性，而且在农村中富有经济价值。过去我国每人每年食糖消费量的纪录约为二公斤，全国每年消费约一百万吨；将来农民生活程度提高，总消费量当不止此，全国产糖（包括台湾）将感不敷供应。如何有计划有步骤地发展广东糖业是值得注意的。
