    Truman Appoints Marshall as Replacement
    [Xinhua News Agency, 13th] According to the U.S. News Service: U.S. President Truman announced on the 12th that he had appointed Marshall to replace Johnson as Secretary of Defense. Since the United States launched its war of aggression against Korea and suffered repeated defeats, Johnson has been attacked by many within the American ruling group. At the annual meeting of the American Overseas Veterans Association on August 30th, and at the annual meeting of the "Marine Corps League" (a Marine Corps veterans group) on September 8th, resolutions were passed demanding the immediate removal of Johnson. New York Democratic Congressman Tauriel even published an open letter on September 3rd, demanding that Johnson "resign from his current position for the sake of the United States." They unanimously condemned Johnson for being responsible for America's failures.

    【新华社十三日讯】据美国新闻处消息：美国总统杜鲁门已于十二日宣布任命马歇尔代替詹逊为国防部长。詹逊自美国在朝鲜发动侵略战争并连遭败北以来即受美国统治集团内许多人的攻击。美国海外退伍军人协会在八月三十日年会上，“海军陆战队联盟”（海军陆战队退伍军人团体）在九月八日的年会上，均曾决议要求立即撤换詹逊；纽约民主党众议员陶里乐并于九月三日发表公开信，要求詹逊“为了美国的利益而辞去现职”。他们一致斥责詹逊应对美国的失败负责。
