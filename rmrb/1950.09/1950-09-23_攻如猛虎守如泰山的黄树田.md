Huang Shutian: An Attacker Like a Fierce Tiger, A Defender Like Mount Tai

　　He Began Begging with His Mother at a Young Age, and Only Turned His Life Around When the Communists Arrived

　　Comrade Huang Shutian is the Third Company Commander of the 596th Regiment of the 20th Army. He has been awarded a "Special Merit." He started begging with his mother at the age of eight, and by the age of twelve, he was working as a hired hand for landlords. It wasn't until the Communists came to his hometown (Mancheng County, Hebei) that Huang Shutian turned his life around. He realized that the Liberation Army was fighting for the liberation of the people, so in June 1944, he shouldered his grenades and joined the army, and in 1945, he honorably joined the Communist Party. Because of his consistent bravery in battle, his repeated refusal to leave the front line despite injuries, and his numerous achievements, he became a well-known combat hero. In March 1950, he represented the 20th Army at the First National Youth Congress.

　　During the South Hebei Campaign in April 1947, our Second Column of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Field Army was tasked with the main offensive mission of attacking Zhengding City and isolating the enemy in Shijiazhuang. Such a large-scale siege was a first for us at the time. The walls of Zhengding City were thirty-six feet high, surrounded by forty li, and garrisoned by the puppet army of Hou Ruyong, as well as a regiment of the bandit Zong Nan's Third Army. The enemy boasted, "Zhengding City has well-trained troops and sufficient food, and reinforcements are easily available (only thirty li from Shijiazhuang). It will take the Eighth Route Army at least three months to capture Zhengding City." However, the battle of Zhengding City only took one night to annihilate the enemy.

　　At that time, Comrade Huang Shutian was the squad leader of the Seventh Squad of the Seventh Company of the Fourteenth Regiment of the Fifth Brigade. The Seventh Company was assigned as the regiment's assault team, and the company decided that the Seventh Squad would be responsible for carrying the ladders. At dusk on the 11th, the battle to attack the city began, and our powerful artillery bombarded the enemy's city walls, suppressing the enemy on the city walls and preventing them from raising their heads. At this moment, all eight members of his squad carried a single wooden ladder, more than four zhang high and weighing more than five hundred jin, quickly passed through the blockade line, jumped over a collapsed stone bridge, and climbed over a moat two zhang wide. It only took five minutes for the ladder to reach the city walls. The enemy panicked and desperately threw grenades down, pushed bricks from the city walls, and tried to push the ladder away with iron forks. Grenades exploded in front of and around Huang Shutian and his comrades, the smoke was thick, and people couldn't see clearly. But everyone held on to the ladder and no one let go. Huang Shutian threw grenades at the city wall, retaliating against the enemy. He called on the whole squad to "Hold the ladder! The assault team is coming!" Sure enough, the assault team quickly climbed up the ladder, but the first soldier, Liu Zhenjiang, was knocked down by the enemy with bricks. Huang Shutian then threw more than a dozen grenades, and the enemy was forced to retreat. He was also wounded in the head, and blood flowed down his face, but he still held the ladder tightly until the assault team climbed onto the city wall and occupied the position. Two signal flares flew brightly into the air, and he bandaged his wound himself. In order to quickly resolve the battle, the company ordered Huang Shutian to take forty kilograms of explosives and go down the city to blow up the south gate. He led the whole squad to the south gate and personally lit the explosives. With a "boom!" the city gate was blown open with a small opening. He then took the lead in using his hands to move away the earth bags and dismantle them into a large opening, so that the main force could pour into the city and carry out street fighting. After the battle, Huang Shutian and his Seventh Squad were awarded a special merit. From then on, the name of Huang Shutian spread throughout the troops.

　　Battle After Battle Tempered Huang Shutian

　　Another battle was the attack on Xushui in July 1948. He again proactively and intelligently completed the task of scaling the city and attacking a large bunker, achieving small casualties and great victory, refusing to leave the front line despite injuries, and earning another merit after the battle. Battle after battle tempered Huang Shutian, and he and the Seventh Company became even stronger. In November 1948, the Northeast Army marched into the Guanzhong area, and our army was ordered to cooperate with friendly forces to liberate Zhangjiakou. The enemy in Zhangjiakou was surrounded by our troops and destined for annihilation. However, they still dreamed of opening a gap and fleeing, risking everything to break through. At that time, the Seventh Company's position was at the very front of the entire regiment. On December 8th, the enemy used four battalions to make a probing attack, rushing towards the Seventh Company's position. The battle lasted for four hours, and the enemy was repeatedly defeated, abandoning more than thirty corpses and retreating. The snowy winter night was accompanied by a northwest wind, swirling with white snow. Company Commander Huang and his soldiers worked through the night to build fortifications. The hands holding the shovels quickly became numb with cold, but Huang Shutian and everyone persisted in digging all night.

　　An Attacker Like a Fierce Tiger, A Defender Like Mount Tai

　　Sure enough, the enemy came on the morning of the 9th! This time they mobilized a total of two infantry divisions, about five regiments, and more than a thousand cavalry. The artillery fired densely, and the battle began.

　　The enemy was first discovered in front of the first platoon's position of the Seventh Company. They crowded up, pushing each other. The platoon leader of the first platoon saw that the enemy was close, and immediately ordered, "Fire all together!" Several enemies fell in response. They crawled down and fired at us, not daring to move forward. After a while, the bandit army commander's flag waved again and again, and the enemy soldiers came up again. Seeing that they were only fifty meters away, our soldiers raised grenades and threw them into the enemy crowd. Although the enemy stopped again, the situation was still very critical. Just then, Company Commander Huang led a platoon to meet them and ordered everyone to jump out of the fortifications and rush to attack the enemy, pushing the enemy back from the front. At this time, another group of enemies pressed down densely in three directions. The position of the Eighth Company's Da Shi Bridge was temporarily withdrawn after several group charges by the enemy. The battalion commander immediately ordered Huang Shutian to lead the Seventh Company to retake the Da Shi Bridge position. Company Commander Huang said to the soldiers of the Seventh Company, "The superiors have given us a difficult task, which is our honor. We must retake the position." Then he waved his hand and said, "Comrades, follow me!" He ran ahead, rushing to about thirty meters away from the enemy, and he and his soldiers threw grenades like raindrops. The enemy rolled back in a panic. They chased while picking up grenades from the enemy corpses and hitting the enemy. They retook the position of the Eighth Company. Huang Shutian was wounded in the hip by the explosion, but he ignored it and insisted on fighting.

　　The enemy was temporarily repelled, so he took advantage of the break in the battle to encourage everyone again, saying, "Whoever can endure the greatest hardship will achieve the final victory. This is a good opportunity for us to make contributions." Before he finished speaking, the enemy came up again, running a few steps timidly and lying down to fire a few shots before getting up and running again, trying to encircle Company Huang Shutian. Only fifty meters away, Huang Shutian and the grenade throwing team of the first platoon threw grenades at the most concentrated place of the enemy. The enemy was in chaos, and the supervisor's flag could no longer be raised.

　　It was already past noon, and after four failed attacks, the enemy temporarily stopped. At this time, the gunfire on both sides became tighter, and the enemy artillery concentrated on bombarding Huang Shutian's position. It turned out that most of the enemy had detoured to the rear of our army. So Company Commander Huang led the soldiers to rush towards the enemy again. He divided all the grenades equally among everyone, ordered each soldier to fix his bayonet, and be sure to fight the enemy down! At this time, five or sixty enemies rolled up to the position of the second platoon. The soldiers' eyes were on fire. At a command, they raised their shiny bayonets and jumped out of the fortifications to meet the enemy.

　　Company Commander Huang had already been wounded twice, and blood kept flowing from his hands, face, and buttocks. He limped as he walked. The battalion commander ordered him to go to the emergency station to apply some medicine, but he simply replied, "The front is tight, I can't go down!" This hero and his soldiers defeated three times, five times, and even ten times the enemy's nine charges, and actively counterattacked the enemy six times, killing and wounding a large number of enemies, until the order for a full-scale counterattack came down, cooperating with friendly forces to completely defeat the enemy. At this time, the sun had already set, and countless enemy corpses were left on the battlefield. After the battle, Huang Shutian was awarded a merit.

　　攻如猛虎守如泰山的黄树田
    从小跟着母亲讨饭吃，共产党来了才翻身
    黄树田同志是二十兵团五九六团的三连长。立过“特功”。他从八岁跟着母亲讨饭吃，十二岁上就去给地主扛长活。直到家乡（河北满城县）来了共产党，黄树田才翻了身。他看清解放军打仗是为老百姓求解放，所以在一九四四年六月背起手榴弹参了军，并在一九四五年光荣参加了共产党。因为他在战斗中一贯的勇敢，几次负伤不下火线，屡立战功，成为有名的战斗英雄。一九五○年三月曾代表二十兵团出席了第一次全国青年代表大会。
    一九四七年四月华北南线战役中，我晋察冀野战军二纵队担负攻打正定城，孤立石家庄敌人的主要攻坚任务。这样大的攻坚战当时在我们来说还是第一次。正定城墙高有三丈六，周围四十里，城内驻守着伪军侯如镛的部队，还有胡匪宗南的第三军一个团。敌人曾夸口说：“正定城内兵精粮足增援容易（距石家庄只三十里），八路军要想打下正定城最少要三个月”。但是正定城的战斗只打了一夜就将敌人歼灭了。
    当时黄树田同志是五旅十四团七连的七班长。七连担负了团的突击队，连决定七班担负靠梯子的任务。十一日黄昏，攻城战斗开始了，我强大炮火向敌人城头轰击，城头的敌人被压得抬不起头来。就在这时，他们全班八个人，抬着四丈多高、五百余斤重的独木梯子，迅速地通过封锁线，跳过一道坍塌的石桥，爬过两丈宽的护城沟，只有五分钟梯子就靠上了。敌人着了慌，拚命的往下扔手榴弹，推城头上的砖块，用铁叉子死劲推梯子。手榴弹在黄树田他们眼前、身旁炸开，烟雾迷漫，人都看不清了。但是大家扶住梯子没有人放手，黄树田用力向城上投手榴弹，还击敌人。他号召全班“压住梯子！突击队上来了！”果然突击组飞快地爬上梯子，但是第一个战士刘振江被敌人用砖头打下来了，黄树田接着又扔上十几个手榴弹，敌人被打得后撤了，他的头部也负了伤，血顺脸流下来，但他仍紧紧地扶住梯子，直到突击队爬上城头，占领了阵地，两颗信号弹，明亮地飞向空中，他才自己将伤口包扎了一下。为了迅速解决战斗，连里再命令黄树田带了四十公斤炸药，下城去爆破南门。他带领全班摸到南门，亲自点着了炸药，“轰！”的一响城门被炸开一个小口，他又带头用手搬开土麻袋，拆成一个大口子，大部队才得涌入城内，进行巷战。战后黄树田和他的七班立了特功，从此黄树田的名字，在部队中便传播开了。
    战斗一次又一次的锻炼着黄树田
    又一次战斗是在一九四八年七月攻打徐水。他又主动、机智地完成登城和攻下一个大碉的任务，做到伤亡小，胜利大，负伤不下火线，战后再记一功。战斗一次又一次地锻炼着黄树田，他和第七连更加坚强了。一九四八年十一月东北大军挺进关里来，我军奉命配合友军解放张家口。张家口的敌人，被我团团包围，注定了他们被歼灭的厄运。但是他们还梦想打开一个口子夺路逃走，不惜一切代价，来冒险突围。当时七连的阵地，在全团最前边。十二月八日，敌人用了四个营的兵力作试探性的进攻；向七连阵地猛扑上来了。战斗进行了四个小时，敌人一次又一次地被打垮，遗弃了三十余具尸体缩回去了。下了雪的冬夜刮着西北风，卷起白茫茫的风雪。黄连长和他的战士们为了完成任务，连夜修筑工事，握着锹的手，很快地冻麻了，但黄树田和大家坚持着挖了一夜。
    攻如猛虎，守如泰山
    九日清晨，敌人果然来了！他们这次一共出动了两个步兵师约五个团和千余骑兵。炮火密集地射击着，战斗开始了。
    七连一排阵地前，首先发现了敌人，他们前呼后拥地挤上来了。一排长看着敌人近了，马上命令“一齐开火！”有几个敌人应声倒下。他们爬下来向我们射击，不敢前进了。过了一会儿，匪军指挥官的小旗摆了又摆，敌兵又上来了，眼看只有五十米，我们的战士举起手榴弹打向敌人群中，敌人虽然又停下来，但形势仍然是很危急的。正好黄连长带着一个排迎上来，命令大家跳出工事冲过去打击敌人，把敌人从正面压了下去。这时另一路敌人分三路密集的压下来，八连的大石桥阵地在敌人几次集团冲锋以后，暂时撤下来了，营长当即命令黄树田带着七连把大石桥阵地夺回来。黄连长对七连的战士们说：“上级把艰巨任务交给我们，是我们的光荣，我们一定把阵地夺回来。”然后他挥挥手说：“同志们跟着我来！”自己前头跑着，一直冲到距敌三十米左右，他和战士们把手榴弹雨点般地打过去，敌人仓惶地向后滚，他们一面追一面捡起敌尸上的手榴弹打着敌人。夺回了八连的阵地。黄树田臀部被炸伤了，但他毫不理会坚持着战斗。
    敌人暂时被打退了，他就利用战斗间隙，又鼓动大家说：“谁能忍受最大的艰苦，谁就能取得最后胜利。这正是我们立功的好机会。”话还没有说完，敌人又上来了，畏缩地跑几步就卧倒放几枪再起来跑，企图包围我黄树田连。相距只有五十米，黄树田和一排投弹组向敌人最集中的地方打去，敌人乱成一团，督战队的小旗子再也举不起来了。
    已经是过午时分了，敌人经过四次的攻击失败以后，暂时停止下来。这时两侧的枪声打得更紧，敌人炮火集中向黄树田的阵地轰击，原来大部敌人迂回到我军后边去了。于是黄连长带领着战士们再冲向敌人，他把所有的手榴弹平均分配给大家，下命令每个战士都上好刺刀，一定要把敌人拼下去！这时二排阵地上有五、六十个敌人滚上来，战士们眼睛冒火，在一声口令下举起雪亮的刺刀跳出工事去迎击敌人。
    黄连长已经负伤两次了，手上、脸上、臀部不住流着血，走路也一拐一拐的。营长命令他下去到救急所上点药，他只简短地回答说：“前边要紧，我不能下去！”这个英雄和他的战士们打垮了三倍五倍以至于十倍的敌人九次冲锋，并主动向敌人反攻了六次，大量地杀伤了敌人，直到全面反击的命令下来，配合友军彻底把敌人打了回去。这时太阳已落山了，战场上留下无数的敌尸。战斗结束后，黄树田记了一功。
