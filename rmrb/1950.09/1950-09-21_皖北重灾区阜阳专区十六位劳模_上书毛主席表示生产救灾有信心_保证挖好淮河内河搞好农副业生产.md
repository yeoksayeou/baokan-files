　　According to the "Northern Anhui Daily": Guo Chengzhang, a labor model from Fuyang Prefecture in Northern Anhui, was selected to attend the National Labor Model Representative Conference. Sixteen labor models from various counties in the prefecture collectively wrote a letter to Chairman Mao to pay their respects and report on the local production and disaster relief situation, asking him to take it to Beijing and present it to Chairman Mao. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Respected Leader Chairman Mao:

We are very honored to have been selected as labor models in our respective counties, and we are also very honored to have participated in the prefecture's labor model selection conference. In addition to recommending Comrade Guo Chengzhang to attend the National Labor Model Conference to pay our respects to you, we also want to bring our words to you.

Before the early summer, our entire region suffered a severe drought. After July, continuous heavy rains caused a major flood disaster, destroying 15 million mu of crops, collapsing more than 600,000 houses, and washing away many livestock and furniture. It was truly a disaster unseen in decades. Just when we were in difficulty, you sent trains, cars, and ships to deliver relief grain to us, and also sent a lot of late-autumn seeds, so that we immediately had food to eat and were able to replant the flooded fields. What moved us the most was that you recently sent a large number of medical team comrades to treat our illnesses, saving the lives of many poor people who were sick but had no money for medicine.

Chairman Mao! You are truly our reborn parents. You are more thoughtful to us than parents are to their children. How can we not respect and love you in our hearts? Chairman Mao, let us call you by the most affectionate name: "Chairman Mao, our savior Bodhisattva!"

Chairman Mao, although we have such a great disaster here, we still hope that you take care of your health and don't worry too much about us, because you still have to lead the people of the whole country to do more great things. Don't exhaust yourself for us. Let me tell you, Chairman Mao! Our local government leaders are very enthusiastic about leading us in production for self-relief, and they care about us as much as you love us, constantly thinking of ways to help us replant, catch insects, prevent epidemics, and protect our farm cattle. The government leads us to do our own things every day.

Chairman Mao! With you as our leader and the leadership of the People's Government, we have confidence in production for self-relief. We will definitely do the following things well to repay your care for us: (1) Fight insects and weeds to ensure a good late-autumn harvest, apply more fertilizer, plant wheat early, and work hard to produce for self-relief. (2) Implement your instructions: dredge the Huai River and inland rivers. (3) Work harder to improve our sideline production. (4) Improve our agricultural production. In addition, we also ask you to lead the people of the whole country to do a few more things well: (1) Do a good job in land reform so that the poor can be liberated forever. (2) Take Taiwan and Tibet, and completely eliminate the remnant bandits of the Kuomintang. (3) Unite well with our Soviet elder brother to defend world peace. (4) Resolutely oppose imperialism provoking war and American imperialism invading Korea. (5) Truly liberate women across the country so that they can be as equal as men.

Chairman Mao, these are all words from our hearts. We feel really honored to have this opportunity to tell you everything today. Respectful greetings!

　　皖北重灾区阜阳专区十六位劳模
    上书毛主席表示生产救灾有信心
    保证挖好淮河内河搞好农副业生产
    【本报讯】据皖北日报消息：皖北阜阳专区劳动模范郭成章，被选为出席全国劳模代表后，该专区各县十六位劳动模范，集体写信向毛主席致敬并报告该地生产救灾情形，请他带到北京转呈毛主席。该信全文如下：敬爱的领袖毛主席：
    我们很荣幸的被选为本县的劳动模范，又很荣幸的参加了专区的选模大会，除推选郭成章同志出席全国劳模大会去向你致敬以外，并把我们要说的话带给你。
    我们这里初夏以前，全区大旱；七月以后，连日大雨，又造成了很大的水灾，庄稼被淹毁了一千五百万亩，房屋冲倒了六十多万间，牲畜和家具也漂去了好多，真是几十年来未见过的大灾。我们正在作难的时候，你派了火车、汽车、轮船给我们送来了救济粮，而且又送来好多晚秋种籽，使我们马上有了饭吃。并补种了被淹的田亩。最使我们感动的是：最近你又派大批医疗队同志给我们看病，使我们许多害病没钱吃药的穷人，保全了生命。
    毛主席！你真是我们的再生父母，你对我们真比父母疼儿女还想得周到，我们的心眼里，怎么能不敬爱你呢？毛主席，让我们对你呼一句最亲爱的话吧：“我们救命的菩萨毛主席！”
    毛主席，我们这里虽有这样大的灾难，我们还望你多保重身体，不要过于为了我们操心，因为你还要领导全国同胞办更多的大事情，不要为我们操心累坏了你的身体。告诉你吧：毛主席！我们当地政府首长领导我们生产自救是很热心的，对我们很关心，也和你疼爱我们一样，时时刻刻替我们想法子补种、捕虫、防疫、保护耕牛。我们自己的事，政府都天天领导我们去做。
    毛主席！我们有了你这样领袖和人民政府的领导，我们对生产自救是有信心的。我们一定做好下面的几件事，来报答你对我们的关心：（一）打虫拔草保证晚秋能收，多上粪、早种麦，努力生产自救。（二）执行你的指示：挖好淮河内河。（三）加油搞好我们的副业生产。（四）提高我们的农业生产。另外，还要求你领导全国同胞再做好几件事：（一）搞好土地改革使穷人永远翻身。（二）打下台湾和西藏，彻底消灭国民党残余匪帮。（三）好好的和苏联老大哥联合保卫世界和平。（四）坚决反对帝国主义挑起战争和美帝国主义侵略朝鲜。（五）使全国女同胞真正翻身，能和男人一样平等。
    毛主席，这些都是我们心坎里的话，今天有这个机会都说给你，我们真觉得荣幸。敬礼！
    皖北阜阳专区劳动模范  界首市刘美英  郭金鲜  张明心  蒙城县周华堂临泉县李春和  顾俊秀  涡阳县李崇山  张文英  阜阳县张树本
  阎龙景  吴文明  太和县陈秀元  李克己  凤台县张志坤  侯庆云  亳县马献才
          九月十日敬上
