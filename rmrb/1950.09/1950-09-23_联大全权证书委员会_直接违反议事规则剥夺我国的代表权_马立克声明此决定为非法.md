Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 22nd: TASS, New York, September 22nd: The Credentials Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, in direct violation of the rules of procedure of the United Nations, at its afternoon meeting on September 21st, rejected the Soviet proposal to deny the credentials of the Kuomintang clique and voted to grant the Kuomintang clique full rights and privileges, thereby depriving the Government of the People's Republic of China of its right to representation.

After the Credentials Committee convened, it elected Belgian representative Nisot as chairman without opposition. Subsequently, the secretary of the committee read out the list of governments that had submitted credentials, including the Kuomintang clique.

Soviet representative Malik stood up to formally deny the so-called credentials of the Kuomintang clique. Referring to the formal application previously submitted by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, Malik declared that this government was the only true government representing the Chinese people. He said: The Kuomintang clique cannot represent China or the Chinese people, and in fact represents no one except itself. Malik pointed out: The Chinese people have driven this clique out of China and have established their own government. He said: Therefore, it is clear that the Kuomintang's current attendance at the United Nations and its agencies is illegal, and its ability to attend is largely due to the United States. Malik formally requested the committee not to recognize the representatives of the Kuomintang clique. After representatives from Chile, Belgium, the United States, the United Kingdom, and India participated in the debate, the chairman asked the committee members to vote on whether the Soviet proposal was in order. Representatives from the Soviet Union and India voted in favor of the Soviet proposal, Belgium abstained, and the other six members (the United States, the United Kingdom, Chile, Mexico, Thailand, and Turkey) voted against the Soviet proposal, deeming it out of order.

At this point, Malik raised a point of order, suggesting that his statement be included in the Credentials Committee's report to the General Assembly, his statement saying that the committee's decision to reject the Soviet proposal to deny the credentials of the Kuomintang was "unfair and illegal" and violated the rules of procedure. Malik declared that the record of the committee's September 21st discussion must also be attached to the report to the General Assembly.

Chairman Nisot then requested a vote on this suggestion, clearly hoping to rely on the American mechanical majority to defeat it. However, Indian representative Keshkar opposed this procedure; after further debate, the committee finally reluctantly agreed to include in the final draft of the report to the General Assembly the record of the committee's rejection of the Soviet proposal to deny the status of the Kuomintang clique, and the Soviet Union's statement accusing the committee's decision of being "unfair and illegal."

　　联大全权证书委员会
    直接违反议事规则剥夺我国的代表权
    马立克声明此决定为非法
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日电：联合国大会全权证书委员会（即资格审查委员会）直接违反联合国的议事规则，在九月二十一日下午会议中否决了苏联所提否认国民党集团证书的提案，并表决给国民党集团以充分的权利与特权，而剥夺中华人民共和国政府的代表权。
    全权证书委员会开会后，即选出比利时代表尼索为主席，无人反对。随即由委员会秘书宣读业已递交代表委任状的各国政府名单，其中包括国民党集团。
    苏联代表马立克站起来正式否认国民党集团的所谓全权证书。马立克在提到中华人民共和国中央人民政府以前提出的正式申请书时，宣称该政府为唯一真正代表中国人民的政府。他说：国民党集团并不能代表中国或中国人民，而且事实上除了代表它本身以外并不代表任何人。马立克指出：中国人民已把这个集团逐出中国，并已建立了自己的政府。他说：因此，很明显，国民党目前出席联合国及其各机构是非法的，它之所以能出席，大部分是得力于美国的缘故。马立克正式要求委员会不承认国民党集团的代表。在智利、比利时、美国、英国及印度的代表参加辩论后，主席要求委员会各委员投票表决苏联提案是否合规则。苏联及印度代表投票赞成苏联提案，比利时弃权，其他六个委员（美国、英国、智利、墨西哥、泰国及土耳其）投票否决苏联提案，认为它不合规则。
    至此，马立克提出议事进程的问题，建议将他的声明列入全权证书委员会对大会的报告中，他的声明说：委员会否决苏联所提否认国民党证书的提案的决定，是“不公平的和非法的”，并且是违反议事规则的。马立克宣称：对大会的报告必须也附上委员会九月二十一日的讨论记录。
    接着主席尼索要求对这个建议进行表决，他显然想依靠美国的机械多数来击败这个建议。可是印度代表凯斯卡反对这种程序；经过继续辩论后，委员会终于勉强同意在对大会的报告定稿中，附上委员会否决苏联所提否认国民党集团的地位的记录，和苏联所发表的指责委员会的决定为“不公平的和非法的”声明。
