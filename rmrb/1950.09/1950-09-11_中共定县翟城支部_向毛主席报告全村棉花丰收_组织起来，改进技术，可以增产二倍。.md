　　CCP Ding County Zhaicheng Branch
    Reports to Chairman Mao on the Village's Bumper Cotton Harvest: Organize and Improve Techniques for Doubled Production.
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The CCP Zhaicheng Branch in Ding County, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on August 28th, reporting on the bumper cotton harvest this year and planning to expand cotton fields by 25% next year. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    Following your instructions to expand cotton fields, our village planted 3,800 mu of cotton this year, more than doubling the 1,800 mu from last year. The cotton bolls have now begun to mature. After our actual investigation and the masses' evaluation, each cotton plant has an average of ten large bolls, estimating a yield of 150 jin of seed cotton per mu. The best plants have more than thirty large cotton bolls each, yielding over 400 jin per mu, while the worst have at least five or six cotton bolls, yielding at least seventy or eighty jin. Last year, the average yield was 50 jin of seed cotton per mu. Therefore, the original plan was to increase production by only 40%, which is to say, to yield 20 jin more of seed cotton per mu. Judging from the current actual situation, it will greatly exceed this, with a potential for doubled production.
    How did we ensure increased cotton production? First, we organized a technical team to regularly study and improve farming techniques. At the same time, we also consulted experienced veteran farmers and promoted their experiences. When the cotton seedlings grew to one or two cun, aphids appeared. At this time, everyone was busy with the wheat harvest, and we were all anxious and helpless. Some people worriedly said, "There's nothing we can do about this, it's over!" At that time, we sent people to the county to ask for instructions and learn pest control methods. On the other hand, we researched old experiences in eliminating aphids within the technical team. Later, using methods such as spraying tobacco leaf water, we finally eliminated the aphids. When picking the first batch of cotton bolls, everyone was indescribably happy to see the large cotton bolls they had been longing for. At this time, we said that in order to ensure an even better cotton harvest next year, we must carry out field selection. Everyone happily said, "Following you is the right thing to do, we must plant even more next year!" Our village then carried out field selection. The whole village also proposed to strive to expand to 5,000 mu of cotton next year.
    The second reason for guaranteeing increased production is that we organized mutual aid teams based on the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, solving the difficulties of manpower and animal power. This spring, in addition to reorganizing the original twenty-six mutual aid teams, we organized three or four more teams. During the busy farming season, we used methods such as staggered plowing, exchanging labor, and contracting work to organize all the people in the village, thus being able to plant, control pests, and prune in a timely manner. I must also tell you that our branch has therefore produced five model party members such as Lü Ruidao, Mi Laocan, and Qin Zhizhen.
    When everyone saw that this year's cotton could have a bumper harvest, they all said, "This is your credit!" We said that it should first be attributed to your leadership, the leadership of the Party. Without you and the Party's leadership, how would we know to expand cotton fields, to organize, and to improve farming techniques?!
    Chairman Mao! We often remember your teaching: Do not be arrogant or complacent in victory, continue to work hard. Please rest assured that we will work even harder to ensure a complete cotton harvest. And we are combining the spirit of Party rectification to examine our work style, in order to ensure the proper completion of autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn planting. We respectfully wish you good health!
    Qin Zhongcai, Secretary of the CCP Ding County Zhaicheng Branch, Qin Jinkai, Deputy Secretary, and all branch committee members

　　中共定县翟城支部
    向毛主席报告全村棉花丰收
    组织起来，改进技术，可以增产二倍。
    【本报讯】河北省定县翟城中共支部，于八月二十八日写信向毛主席报告今年棉田丰收情形，并计划明年扩大棉田百分之二十五。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    遵照您的指示：扩大棉田，俺村今年就种了三、八○○亩棉花，比去年的一、八○○亩增加了一倍多。现在棉桃已开始成熟。经过俺们实际调查和群众评议，每棵棉平均有十个大桃，估计每亩可收籽花一五○斤。其中最好的每棵结了三十多个大棉桃，每亩可收四○○斤以上，最坏的也有五、六个棉桃，至少收七、八十斤。去年每亩平均收籽花五十斤，因此原来计划每亩只增产百分之四十，就是每亩要多收籽花二十斤。按眼前实际情况来看，就会大大超过，可以增产二倍。
    俺们是怎样保证棉田增产的呢？首先，俺们组织了技术小组，经常研究改进耕作技术，同时还向有经验的老农请教，推广他们的经验。当棉苗长到一二寸时，就发生了蚜虫，这时正忙着麦收，大家着急的没办法。有些人着急的说：“这可没办法了，完啦！”当时，俺们一面派人去县里请示与学习治虫办法，另一方面，就在技术小组中研究扑灭蚜虫的老经验。后来使用喷烟叶水等办法，终于把蚜虫消灭了。在摘第一期花桃时，大家看到自己心眼里盼望很久的大花桃，真是说不出的高兴。这时俺们说，为了保证明年棉花收成更好，要进行田间选种，大家高兴的说：“跟着你们走就没错，明年还得多种些！”俺村就进行了田间选种。全村并提出明年要争取扩大到五千亩棉花。
    保证增产的第二个原因，即在自愿两利的原则下，组织了互助组，解决了人、畜力的困难。今春除了把原有的二十六个互助组进行了整顿，又组织了三、四个小组外，在农忙时，采用插犋、换工、包工等方式，把全村人都组织起来，因此能够作到及时下种、治虫、整枝。还要告诉您的，我们支部因此出现了吕瑞多、米老餐、秦志振等五个模范党员。
    当大家看到今年棉花可以丰收时，都说：“这是你们的功劳？”俺们说首先应当归功于您的领导，党的领导。没有您和党的领导，俺们怎么会知道要扩大棉田，要组织起来，要改进耕作技术呢？！
    毛主席！俺们常常记得您的教导：在胜利情况下，不要骄傲，不自满，继续努力工作。请您放心，俺们一定要更努力，保证棉花完全丰收。并且正在结合整党精神，检查俺们的工作作风，以保证作好秋收、秋耕、秋种等工作。敬祝您身体健康！
