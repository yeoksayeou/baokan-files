The Translation Community Should Insist on Criticism
    Dong Qiushi
    Since the publication of "Translation Bulletin," the editorial board has received many letters from readers (translation workers), raising many questions and opinions, touching on almost every aspect of translation work. Because there have been few opportunities for everyone to exchange ideas in the past, there are bound to be different views on individual issues, which are expressed in various different opinions. We plan to publish abstracts of all the questions and opinions in the "Translation Bulletin," then sort them out, divide them into several general issues and general opinions, and ask responsible comrades from relevant departments to answer them, or propose them separately for public discussion. Through such treatment, we hope that appropriate solutions and consistent views can be obtained on several important issues and divergent opinions. If we can achieve this step, the quality of our entire translation work will be improved.
    Because opinions from all sides are still being submitted continuously, and the space in "Translation Bulletin" is limited, it must be published in installments and cannot be concluded here; also because we have too few people and have to do other work at the same time, we cannot process it appropriately at any time. This summary work will probably take some time to complete. I only want to talk about one of the many issues mentioned above. This is definitely not a summary; but just to let everyone know that problems do exist in our translation community, and they must be solved.
    What I want to talk about is the issue of translation criticism. The second issue of "Translation Bulletin" published my article "How to Establish Criticism and Self-Criticism in the Translation Community." I will not repeat what I said there. The motivation for writing this article was mainly caused by letters from several readers. Summarizing their opinions, it is roughly: criticism is prone to abuse in the current translation community and should not be advocated. The "abuses" they refer to are the following:
    1. It makes already cautious translators more cautious, so that they dare not start, leaving the territory to those irresponsible translators and publishers, resulting in fewer good translations and more bad translations.
    2. Raising the standard too high makes most new learners of translation daunted, and the new force cannot be expanded, thus failing to meet the current need for translation work.
    3. Criticism inevitably mixes impure motives, using the topic for personal attacks, affecting the unity of the translation community.
    4. Sloppy work is a thing of the past. Now everyone knows to be responsible to the people, and there is no need for criticism at all.
    We admit that the above points of view have some truth. But we cannot but say that those who make the above claims only see one side of the problem and do not see the whole picture; they only see the "abuses" of criticism and do not fully recognize the importance of criticism. We might as well talk about each of the above points separately.
    First of all, correct criticism not only points out the bad, but also praises the good. In any case, it is not a blow. Cautious translators should be encouraged by criticism, strengthen their self-confidence, and work more actively. How can they "dare not start"? Moreover, even cautious translators still need criticism, and especially should not be afraid of criticism. As for irresponsible translators and publishers, they are truly the objects of exposure and condemnation, and our critics will definitely not relax their efforts. The recent closure of such a bookstore in Shanghai is the best proof. Like in the past, not distinguishing right from wrong, not distinguishing the good from the bad, is the most headache for cautious translators. Therefore, we believe that correct criticism is beneficial to cautious translators and will never condone irresponsible people.
    Secondly, whether the standard is high or not is not determined by subjective wishes, but by objective facts. Correct criticism must first recognize objective standards and should not make excessive demands; at the same time, it must also recognize the object and pay attention to guidance and encouragement for new learners of translation. In fact, our translation community should have several different treatments; not only taking care of beginners, but also not burying experts. The method similar to "egalitarianism" in the past was problematic. Under the appropriate care of correct criticism, not only will it not suppress the new force, but it can also expand it rapidly. In addition, we should also note that the standard is not immutable and must be continuously improved, which is also one of the main tasks of criticism.
    As for the motive of criticism, I don't think it is an important issue. The criticism we are talking about is not talking about people behind their backs, but is visible to everyone. As long as his criticism makes sense, even if he has the motive of attacking me, I should still accept it. This is the demeanor and discernment that a modern person should have. If his criticism is entirely out of his dislike for me, picking on faults and making unwarranted accusations, even if the editor publishes it without discrimination, the readers' eyes are also sharp, and the person who abuses criticism will inevitably be condemned in the end. Only with this kind of democratic and open criticism can we reach a consensus and achieve true unity. Appropriate criticism is the true foundation of unity.
    Finally, saying that the era of shoddy work has passed, just a little attention to the current situation of the translation community will know that this is not in line with the facts. The collapse of the old regime does not mean the extinction of old habits and old customs. We still have to fight against the atmosphere of shoddy work for a long time. Our weapon is criticism.
    Extensive criticism is ultimately a new thing in our country, which inevitably causes some people's concerns and distrust. At the same time, because this is a new thing, people who use it are prone to deviations, and those who are criticized feel even more embarrassed. For example, the translation criticism we see now, because it has not recognized the current proper standards, is inevitably too strict; in their eyes, it seems that there is no readable translation book, which is obviously wrong. Some people also treat criticizing translation as correcting homework for elementary school students, correcting it word by word and sentence by sentence, which may have certain benefits for the person being criticized, but it cannot play a role in improving the entire translation community, because this is mostly not typical, not the problem that most people require to solve.
    Compared with the critic, the criticized is even more unaccustomed to criticism. What we used to be accustomed to is flattering in person, and what we dislike most is exposing shortcomings in public. Criticism superficially resembles exposing shortcomings in public, which makes people unable to step down. When criticized, people with high awareness and deep cultivation will inevitably be brave to accept and make self-reflection. But there are also some people who inevitably try every means to find excuses to defend themselves, and even bite back, picking on criticism itself to weaken its due effect.
    For example, for a long book of more than one million words, if you say that you are not qualified to criticize it unless you proofread it from beginning to end against the original book; even if you criticize it, you cannot make any conclusions. This seems to support criticism on the surface, but in fact it eliminates criticism. Because that is not easy for any critic to do, and criticism without conclusions is not criticism. In fact, a book of more than one million words does not need to be read all the way through, as long as you see a certain extent, you can make a correct conclusion on the translation. There is no such reason in the world that the beginning of a translation is full of errors, but the back is translated very appropriately. Even if there is, it cannot be regarded as a good translation.
    We must admit that our current translation criticism is still in a relatively naive stage, far from the mature state. Mainly because we cannot have a comprehensive understanding of the entire translation community, it is not easy to set a standard that is not too high or too low; in addition, everyone is not good at finding typical examples and key points, and is not used to praising advantages, so they cannot exert the due effect of criticism. As long as we truly understand the importance of criticism, our correct attitude must be to understand it, cherish it, cultivate it, guide it, so that it can get out of the naive stage and enter the mature stage as soon as possible. Everything can only be matured in practice. If swimming is not allowed because the posture of beginning swimming is not good, there will never be swimmers in the world.
    Because everyone is not used to criticism, they are inevitably surprised when they encounter criticism. This is just a temporary phenomenon, and it will slowly pass. On the other hand, editors of newspapers and periodicals should recognize this point, persevere, and not be shaken by the temporary noise. In short, criticism and self-criticism is one of the main principles of our era. If we do it badly, we can correct it. In terms of principles, we cannot give in.

### 翻译界应坚持批评

　　翻译界应坚持批评
    董秋斯
    《翻译通报》创刊以来，编委会接到很多读者（翻译工作者）的来信，提出了很多问题和意见，几乎翻译工作上的每一面都接触到了。因为过去很少大家交换意见的机会，对个别问题难免有不同的看法，也就表现了各种不同的意见。我们准备把所有问题和意见摘要发表在《翻译通报》上，然后整理一下，分成几个总问题和总意见，请有关部门负责同志去解答，或分别提出来公开讨论。经过这样的处理，我们希望，对若干重要的问题和纷歧的见解，可以得到适当的解决和一致的看法。能作到这一步，我们整个翻译工作的质量，是会收到提高的效果的。
    因为各方面的意见还在继续不断地交来，加上《翻译通报》的篇幅有限，必须分期登载，不能就此告一段落；也因为我们人手太少，又要兼作别种工作，不能随时作适当的处理，这一总结性的工作，恐怕还需要一些时日，才能作得出来。我现在只想就以上所说的诸多问题中提出一个来谈谈。这断乎不是什么总结；不过借此让大家知道，我们翻译界的确存在着问题，而且非解决不可罢了。
    我所要谈的是翻译批评问题。《翻译通报》第二期登载了我的一篇《怎样建立翻译界的批评与自我批评》。那里边说过的话，这里不再重复。我写这一篇话的动机，主要的是由几位读者的来信引起的。把他们的意见归纳起来，大致是：批评在目前的翻译界容易发生流弊，不应提倡。他们所谓“流弊”，有以下几点：
    一、使本来慎重的翻译工作者更加慎重，以致不敢动手，把地盘让给那些不负责任的译者和出版家，结果是，好的译本更少，坏的译本更多了。
    二、把标准提得太高，使多数新学翻译的人望而却步，新生力量不能扩充，因而无法满足当前对翻译工作的需要。
    三、批评难免夹杂不纯的动机，借题目作个人攻击，影响了翻译界的团结。
    四、粗制滥造是过去的事了，现在大家都知道对人民负责，根本用不着批评了。
    我们承认，上述的几点意见都有一定的道理。但是我们不能不说，作以上主张的人，只看到问题的一面，没有看到问题的全面；只看到批评的“流弊”，没有充分认识批评的重要性。我们不妨就以上几点分别来谈一谈。
    先说第一点，正确的批评，不但指出坏的，还要表扬好的，无论如何，不是打击。慎重的翻译工作者，应当从批评中得到鼓励，加强自信心，更积极地工作，何至于“不敢动手”呢？而且就是慎重的翻译工作者，也还需要批评，尤其不应当怕批评。至于不负责任的译者和出版家，那才真是揭发和指责的对象，我们的批评家断乎不会放松的，最近上海一家这样的书店的倒闭就是最好的证明。像过去那样，是非不分，良莠不辨，才是慎重的翻译工作者最头痛的事。所以，我们认为，正确的批评，对慎重的翻译工作者，是有百利而无一害的，决不会纵容了不负责任的人。
    其次，标准的高或不高，不是由主观愿望来决定的，是由客观事实来决定的。正确的批评，首先要认识客观的标准，不应作过高的要求；同时还要认清对象，对新学翻译的人，要注重指导和鼓励。事实上，我们翻译界原应该有几种不同的待遇；不但照顾了初学的人，也不至埋没了专家。像过去那种类似“平均主义”的办法是有问题的。在正确批评的适当照顾下，不但不会抑制新生力量，反可使它迅速地扩充起来。此外，我们还应当注意，标准不是一成不变的，要继续不断的提高，这也是批评的主要任务之一。
    至于批评的动机如何，我看倒不是重要问题。我们所说的批评，不是在背后说人，而是与众共见的。只要他批评的有道理，尽管他怀有攻击我的动机，我还是应当接受的。这是作一个现代人应有的风度和识量。假如，他的批评完全出于他对我的嫌怨，一味吹毛求疵，深文周纳，就是编者不加辨别地发表出来，读者的眼睛也是雪亮的，受到最后谴责的，必然是那个滥用批评的人。只有靠了这种民主的公开的批评，才能取得一致的意见，达到真正的团结。适当的批评才是团结的真实基础。
    最后，说粗制滥造的时代已经过去，只要稍稍留意一下目前翻译界的情形，就会知道这是不合事实的。旧政权的垮台，并不等于旧习惯旧风气的绝灭。我们还要长时期地与粗制滥造的风气斗争呢。我们的武器就是批评。
    广泛的批评在我国究竟是一件新事情，不免要引起若干人的顾虑和不信任。同时，因为这是一件新事情，运用的人容易发生偏向，受批评的人更是觉得难堪，例如，我们现时常见的翻译批评，由于未认清当前应有的标准，未免要求过严；在他们眼中，好像没有一本可读的翻译书，那显然是不对的。也有人把批评翻译当作给小学生改课卷，逐字逐句地校改，这对被批评的人可能有一定的好处，但对整个翻译界来说，并不能起提高的作用，因为这多半不是典型，不是多数人要求解决的问题。
    对于批评，被批评的人比批评人的人更加不习惯。我们过去所习惯的是当面奉承，最不喜欢的是当众揭短。批评在表面上类似当众揭短，最使人下不来台。受到批评时，觉悟高、修养深的人，必然勇于接受，并且作自我检讨。但也有一些人，不免千方百计地找借口，为自己辩护，甚至反咬一口，去向批评本身吹毛求疵，以削弱它应有的效力。
    例如，对于一部长达百余万字的大书，假若说，非把它从头到尾对照原书校勘一遍就没有资格去批评；就是批评，也不能下任何断语，这在表面上似乎是拥护批评了，实际上却是打消了批评。因为那是任何批评家都不易办到的，而没有断语的批评也就不成其为批评。事实上，一部百余万字的大书，断乎用不着全部看完，只要看到一定的程度，也就可以对译文作出正确的结论。一个译本开头部分错误百出，而后面却译得十分妥贴，世间不会有这样的道理。就是有，也不能算作好译本。
    我们必须承认，我们目前的翻译批评，还处在比较幼稚的阶段，离着成熟的境界还很远。主要地因为我们对整个翻译界还不能有全面的认识，不易定出一个不高不低恰如其分的标准；此外，大家还不长于找典型、找重点，不惯于表扬优点，因而不能发挥批评应有的效用。只要我们真正了解了批评的重要性，我们的正确态度必然是体谅它，爱护它，培养它，指导它，使它早日脱离幼稚的阶段，进入成熟的阶段。凡事只有在操练中才能得到成熟。假如因为开始游泳的姿态不好，就不许游泳，世界上再也不会有游泳家了。
    因为大家不习惯批评，一遇到批评，不免大惊小怪，这不过是一时的现象，慢慢就要过去的。倒是报纸刊物的编辑人，要认清这一点，坚持下去，不要为一时的哗啦哗啦所动摇。总之，批评与自我批评是我们这时代的主要原则之一。作得不好，我们可以改正，在原则方面，我们是不能让步的。
