　　Promoting Urban-Rural Exchange Through Long-Distance Sales
    Nanjing Private Merchants Go to the Countryside to Purchase New Rice
    [This newspaper's report] According to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily: As new rice began to appear on the market, more than forty private grain merchants in Nanjing (including Yong'an, Shenfuxing, Xinhe Joint, Tailong, Minsheng, Mintian, Yang Juhe, Hongyuan, Jiaxiang, etc.) went to suburban areas and nearby rice-producing areas such as Jurong, Tangshan, Xintang, Jiangning, Hushu, Lukou, and Xuancheng to purchase rice, encouraged by the government's call for funds to go to the countryside. Some are also preparing to go to Hunan Province, a more distant rice-producing area.

    Before liberation, there were many obstacles to purchasing in the countryside. Some township and village heads and Baojia feudal forces in rice-producing areas colluded with the local governments of the Kuomintang reactionaries to prevent the transportation of goods, in order to facilitate their manipulation and plunder, creating mutual separation between urban and rural areas. After liberation, the People's Government implemented free trade and encouraged the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. As a result, private grain merchants have found it much easier to purchase in the countryside and receive great convenience and assistance. Therefore, recently, civilian ships carrying grain merchants to various places for purchases have been coming and going in an endless stream. Private manufacturers with thicker capital are preparing to invest independently or jointly to purchase rice in the rice-producing area around Miluo, Hunan. This will play a significant role in promoting the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

　　促进城乡交流进行远途运销
    南京私商下乡收购新稻
    【本报讯】据南京新华日报讯：新稻开始登场后，南京市私营粮商在政府号召资金下乡，面向农村的鼓励下，已有四十余户（计有永安、申复兴、新和联营、泰隆、民生、民天、杨聚和、洪源、嘉祥等）去郊区及附近的句容、汤山、新塘、江宁、湖熟、禄口、宣城等产米区进行采购，并有的准备到较远的产米地区湖南省去。
    在解放之前，因下乡采购阻碍很多，有些产米地区的乡、镇、村的乡、村长及保甲等封建势力，勾结国民党反动派的地方政府，不准随便贩运出境，以便利他们操纵掠夺，造成城乡之间互相隔阂；解放后，人民政府实行贸易自由，鼓励城乡物资交流，因而私营粮商到乡下采购得到很大的方便与协助，因此最近载粮商至各地采购的民船往来络绎不绝。资金较厚的私营厂商，则准备独资或联合起来到湖南汨罗一带的产米地区去采购。这对促进城乡物资交流是有很大作用的。
