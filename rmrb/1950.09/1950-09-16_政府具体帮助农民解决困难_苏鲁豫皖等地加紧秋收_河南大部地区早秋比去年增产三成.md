Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, September 14th: Farmers in Shandong, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, and the riverbank areas of Northern Anhui are currently intensifying their autumn harvest. In Shandong Province's Linqi, Yishui, Tai'an, Dezhou, and Huimin special districts, sorghum, millet, and other crops have been mostly harvested. After completing the harvest of early and mid-season rice, farmers in Northern Jiangsu are now rushing to harvest late-season rice, corn, and soybeans. Farmers in Southern and Northern Anhui are also intensely harvesting mid-season and late-season rice.

The autumn harvest in most of the aforementioned areas has been bountiful. In some areas of Shandong Province, the yield of sorghum and millet has doubled compared to last year. The rice production in Northern Jiangsu this year has also basically achieved the planned 10% increase. The yield of early rice in Southern Anhui is generally at 80% of a normal year, and the yield of early rice along the Yangtze River is generally 20% to 30% higher than in the years before liberation. Although many areas of Northern Anhui suffered from floods this year, the rice production along the river is good. The harvest in the Chaohu special district of that administrative region is, on average, 10% higher than last year.

This year's autumn harvest work has generally been timely and swift. Leading authorities in various regions have conducted thorough ideological mobilization among cadres and the masses before the autumn harvest. The leading authorities in some areas have widely publicized the lessons learned from past losses due to untimely autumn harvests to cadres and the masses, explaining the importance of rushing to harvest. In some areas of Northern Jiangsu, the enthusiasm of farmers for autumn production has been enhanced through activities such as evaluating crops, comparing production, and selecting labor models. In some areas, supply and marketing cooperatives have provided a large number of agricultural tools at the beginning of the autumn harvest to help farmers solve the problem of lacking tools. Furthermore, farmers in various parts of East China have been actively organizing and developing mutual aid teams in the autumn harvest to rationally utilize labor. For example, after reorganization, the farmers in Qinglou District, Yancheng County, Northern Jiangsu, newly established 729 mutual aid teams based on the original 1,374 mutual aid teams. Each mutual aid team has made specific adjustments and mutual assistance based on the amount of paddy and dry land of each household in the team, the maturity of autumn crops, and the amount of labor and tools in the team, so that the autumn rice can be harvested quickly. At the same time, the leading authorities in Chaohu special district, Northern Anhui, have also planned to recruit more than 2,000 migrant disaster victims during the autumn harvest to help local farmers harvest autumn rice, which not only solved the problem of labor shortage in the special district but also helped the disaster victims solve some of their living problems. In the areas along the rivers, the farmers have implemented the methods of "harvesting and threshing simultaneously" and "combining autumn harvest with flood prevention" to ensure timely autumn harvest and avoid losses caused by unexpected disasters.

Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, September 12th: The early autumn crops in most areas of Henan Province have been harvested, and local farmers are now actively plowing the land and transporting manure to prepare for planting wheat. Sorghum and early millet crops in the vast plains of Central and Eastern Henan have now been completely harvested, and the harvesting of early millet in the mountainous areas of Western Henan has also begun. Except for a few areas in the province that have suffered from water, hail, and other disasters, most areas have seen a general increase of 30% in early autumn crops such as sorghum and millet compared to last year. The production enthusiasm of the masses of farmers has been further heightened after the bumper harvest of early autumn crops. They are now carrying out work such as plowing early autumn land, transporting manure, and composting manure, actively preparing for wheat planting. Chenliu County has plowed nine-tenths of its 137,700 mu of sorghum land and is now beginning to transport manure. In order to strive for more fertilizer for wheat fields, 40 farmers in Mazhuang, Xinzheng County, have also composted more than 400 carts of green manure in half a month.

In order to help poor farmers solve the difficulties of lacking cattle, agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizers, so that wheat can be planted in time, the Henan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China has issued agricultural loans of 28.76 billion yuan, which are currently being evaluated and distributed in various places. At the same time, the Henan Provincial People's Government's Department of Agriculture has also loaned all of the 2.86 million jin of high-quality wheat varieties that were evaluated and purchased in various places during this year's wheat harvest to farmers for planting, with a focus on key areas.

　　政府具体帮助农民解决困难
    苏鲁豫皖等地加紧秋收
    河南大部地区早秋比去年增产三成
    【新华社上海十四日电】山东、苏北、皖南和皖北沿江地区广大农民，现正加紧秋收。山东省的临沂、沂水、泰安、德州、惠民等专区的高粱、谷子等作物已大部赶收完毕。苏北农民继收完早稻和中稻后，现正在赶收晚稻、玉蜀黍和黄豆等作物。皖南、皖北等地农民也正在紧张地收割中熟稻和晚稻。
    上述大部地区秋禾都告丰收，山东省有些地区的高粱、谷子产量较去年增加一倍。苏北今年的稻产也基本上完成了增产一成的计划。皖南早稻产量一般都有八成年景，沿长江一带的早稻产量普遍要比解放前一年增产二成到三成。皖北今年虽有不少地区遭受水灾，但沿江地区稻产良好。该行政区巢湖专区收成平均要比去年增产一成。
    今年各地秋收工作，一般做到了及时迅速，各地领导机关于秋收前在干部和群众中均进行了较充分的思想动员。有的地区的领导机关将过去某些地区因秋收不及时而招致损失的教训，向干部和群众广泛宣传，说明赶收赶割的重要。苏北若干地区并通过评庄稼、比生产、选劳动模范等工作，提高了农民秋季生产的积极性。有的地区的供销合作社在秋收开始时贷出了大批农具，帮助农民解决缺少农具的困难。其次华东各地农民在秋收中，更纷纷整理和发展变工互助以求合理使用劳动力。如苏北盐城县庆楼区农民，秋收中，在原有一千三百七十四个互助组的基础上，经过了整理后，即又新建立互助组七百二十九个。他们每个互助组都根据全组各户的水田和旱田的数量，秋季作物成熟的迟早和组内劳动力、工具的多寡等情况，具体进行调剂互助，使秋稻很快地收割完毕。同时，皖北巢湖专区领导机关在秋收中更有计划地招雇了二千多名外来灾民，帮助当地农民收割秋稻，这样不但解决了该专区劳动力不足的困难，而且也帮助灾民解决了一部分生活问题。在沿江河地区的农民群众，则实行了“边收边打”和“秋收与防汛结合”的办法，保证及时进行秋收，避免了意外灾害所招致的损失。
    【新华社开封十二日电】河南省大部地区早秋作物已收割完毕，当地农民现正积极犁地、送粪，准备种麦。豫中、豫东广大平原的高粱和早谷作物现已全部收完，豫西山丘地带的早谷也已开镰。全省今秋除少数遭受水、雹等灾的地区略有歉收外，大部地区高粱、谷子等早秋作物一般都比去年增产三成。农民群众在早秋丰收后生产情绪更形高涨，现正进行犁早秋地、送粪、沤粪等工作，积极为种麦作准备。陈留县十三万七千余亩高粱地已犁完十分之九，现正开始送粪。新郑县马庄四十户农民为争取麦田多施肥料，半月间亦沤出绿肥四百余车。
    中国人民银行河南省分行为帮助贫苦农民解决耕牛、农具、种籽、肥料缺乏的困难，使麦子得以及时下种，特发出农业贷款二百八十七亿六千万元，现各地正在评议、发放中。同时，河南省人民政府农业厅今年麦收时在各地评选收购的二百八十六万余斤的优良小麦品种，也已全部有重点地贷给农民种植。
