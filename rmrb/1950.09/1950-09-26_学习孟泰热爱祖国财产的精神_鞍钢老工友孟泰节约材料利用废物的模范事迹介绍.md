Learn from Meng Tai’s Spirit of Loving National Property
	Introduction to the Exemplary Deeds of Meng Tai, an Old Anshan Iron and Steel Worker, in Conserving Materials and Utilizing Waste

	The people's steel capital, Anshan, suffered severe damage and looting by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits during the Northeast Liberation War. After liberation, many difficulties were encountered during the restoration process, especially the lack of equipment, some of which could not be bought even with money. But the people's steel capital was finally restored. This was the result of the Anshan Iron and Steel workers giving play to the attitude of masters of their own affairs, inspiring great wisdom, collecting all kinds of equipment from the destroyed ruins, utilizing waste materials, overcoming difficulties, and working diligently in construction. Meng Tai, a 53-year-old pipe fitter, is one of the thousands of workers who is most worthy of praise.

	Utilizing waste materials solved the most difficult problem of equipment shortage during the restoration period

	After the liberation of Anshan, all the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel faced the arduous task of restoring the factory. Meng Tai realized that the main difficulty in restoring the factory was the lack of equipment, so he decided to concentrate his efforts to overcome it. Comrade Meng Tai did not complain to the higher authorities, nor did he reach out to the warehouse. Under his leadership, all the workers of the Iron Smelting Plant first searched in the scrap iron piles in the ruins, and found 1,300 three-way water valves (made of copper) alone, enough equipment for the restoration of the cooling equipment of Blast Furnace No. X, saving the country an astonishing amount of wealth, and solving the difficulty of not being able to buy it with money. All the parts and equipment of all the cooling equipment on the × blast furnaces that have been put into operation in the Iron Smelting Plant have been collected by Meng Tai himself from the scrap steel piles, repaired, and then installed on the blast furnaces.

	Because Comrade Meng Tai has consistently and actively collected equipment, the piping team he leads rarely receives equipment from the warehouse. For example, on March 22, when the blast furnace was shut down for the first time, he heard Section Chief Song Yukun say: "The two-inch safety pipe is really worrying. These few are just enough now. If another one breaks, there will be no way to replace it." The next day, he mobilized the workers to search everywhere. In three days, he found 24 pieces and took them to the lathe team for repair. Four pieces were used immediately when the blast furnace was shut down for the second time, which solved a major difficulty in the work. This year, the company plans to build Blast Furnace No. ×. When he heard that there was no material, he led the workers to collect materials everywhere. After three months of work, the important parts of the piping materials for repairing Blast Furnaces No. × and × were collected and used. In addition to half of the equipment used for assembly, there are still: 151 copper air valves, 16 high-pressure air valves, 81 live joints, 49 inside joints, 195 joints, 57 tees, 716 elbows, 15 radiator expansion joints, 400 screws, 50 meters of red electric wire, and two bundles of iron wire weighing 20 kilograms. 24 safety steel pipes, etc. Meng Tai's spirit of loving national property infected others and had a great impact on the workers.

	Improve technology, implement systems, and no responsibility accidents occurred throughout the year

	Meng Tai always cares about the factory more than his own home and his own life. One winter night with heavy snow, Meng Tai couldn't sleep on the kang, thinking about the factory. His wife said, "Are you talking in your sleep?" He said, "It's snowing so heavily, won't the blast furnace water pipes freeze and delay production?" The next morning, he hurried to the factory to check the water pipes. Meng Tai often studied day and night based on the experience of accidents that occurred in the puppet Manchukuo, and came up with ways to improve his work. For example, minerals in the water often settle in the water pipes, which hinders the circulation of water and causes the cooling equipment to be burned out. He came up with a method to use steam or cold air to blow all the pipes twice a month with rubber pipes, so that the impurities deposited in the water pipes were removed. He also improved the technology of the slag outlet ring water section (cooling equipment) by adding an inlet pipe, so the cooling efficiency was improved and the difficulty of low water pressure at that time was solved. Comrade Meng Tai also put forward the slogans of "Three Guarantees" and "Four Diligences." The three guarantees are: "Guarantee no water leakage, no air leakage, and no gas leakage," and the four diligences are: "Be diligent in watching, diligent in walking, diligent in checking, and diligent in repairing." Since the resumption of work in the Iron Smelting Plant, × blast furnaces have been put into operation one after another. Although the cooling equipment and accessories are all made of waste materials, thanks to Meng Tai's improved technology, the establishment of a work system, and his personal example in conscientiously implementing it, no responsibility accidents occurred in the piping work throughout the year.

	Consistently fights against the difficulties in work with a selfless spirit

	Meng Tai consistently fights against the difficulties in work with a selfless spirit. Although he is over fifty years old, he works like a young man. He has never flinched from particularly difficult and dangerous work, and always does it himself. For example, once the middle and upper pipes of Blast Furnace No. × were broken, and gas smoke was coming out. He risked his life and ran to the top to repair them first. Many workers advised him to come down (because the middle and upper part of the blast furnace is very high, and once the gas is very strong, I am afraid it will be too late to hide), but he always insisted on working until he finished the work. Once he was fainted by gas. When the person in charge went to comfort him, he had just woken up and said, "This little thing is nothing." Whenever he accepted the tasks given to him by his superiors, he never bargained. Sometimes the superiors were afraid that he would have difficulties, but he always said with a smiling face, "This is easy to do," "It's nothing." Especially when he accepted the task of installing insulation pipes for the raw material storage tank, the weather was already very cold, and the storage tank was about to freeze, which attracted the attention of all the comrades in the factory. (Because once the ore in the storage tank freezes, it cannot be transported to the blast furnace. This is unimaginable for affecting production.) Meng Tai accepted this urgent task and convened all the workers to discuss and study it, which required 170 workers to complete. As the cold weather continued to increase, Comrade Meng Tai was restless, and he was unwilling to go back after work, and he was always thinking about how to strive for early completion. Meng Tai studied the original plan to cut off and install the joint when the insulation pipe turned, so each pipe head had to be threaded, which not only wasted manpower but also wasted materials. Therefore, Meng Tai changed the original plan and did not thread the pipe when it turned to another direction, but welded it with oxygen, which saved 30 man-hours and 120 elbows, and completed the insulation task of the raw material storage tank ahead of schedule.

	Meng Tai has excellent qualities and gloriously joined the Communist Party

	Meng Tai has the excellent qualities of the working class. He feels very uncomfortable when he sees the waste of national property. During the more than one year from the restoration to the production of Anshan Iron and Steel, the model deeds created by Meng Tai are simply endless. He has been selected as the first-class and special-class meritorious worker of Anshan Iron and Steel, and has been awarded three times.

	Meng Tai drifted from his hometown in Hebei to the Northeast to work when he was 19 years old, and has been working for 33 years now. This long period of painful and tragic life has tempered him into a strong and outstanding member of the working class. After the liberation of Anshan in February 1948, Meng Tai has been promoted from an ordinary worker to a piping technician. In August 1949, he gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party.

　　学习孟泰热爱祖国财产的精神
    鞍钢老工友孟泰节约材料利用废物的模范事迹介绍
    人民钢都——鞍山在东北解放战争中遭受蒋匪严重的破坏和洗劫。解放后，在进行修复过程中遇着许多困难，特别是器材缺乏，有的花钱也买不到。但是人民钢都终于修复起来了。这是鞍钢全体职工发挥了主人翁的劳动态度，启发伟大的智慧，在被破坏了的废墟上，搜集各种器材，利用废物，克服困难，辛勤建设的结果。五十三岁的配管工人孟泰，就是这上千上万个工友中间最值得赞扬的一个。
    利用废物，解决了修复时期最困难的器材缺乏问题
    鞍山解放后，鞍钢全体工友面临着修复工厂的艰巨任务。孟泰认识到修复工厂的主要困难是器材缺乏，于是决心集中力量来克服它。孟泰同志没有向上级诉苦，也没有伸手向仓库要，在他的领导下，炼铁厂全体工友，首先到废墟的乱铁堆中去找，仅三通水门即找到了一三○○个（铜质），足够×号高炉修复冷却设备的器材，给国家节省了一笔惊人的财富，并解决了花钱买不到的困难。现在炼铁厂已经开火的×个高炉上的所有冷却设备的零件器材，全部是经孟泰亲手从乱钢堆里搜集起来，经过修理后，才按装在高炉上使用的。
    由于孟泰同志一贯积极搜集器材，因此，他领导的配管组到仓库领的器材很少。如三月二十二日高炉第一次休风时，他听到宋玉昆科长说：“二寸保险管真愁人。现在这几根刚刚够用，如果再坏一根就没有办法啦。”第二天他就动员工友四处寻找。三天的工夫就找了二十四根，拿到车工组去修理。第二次休风马上就用了四根，这就解决了工作上的重大困难问题。今年公司计划修建×高炉，当他听说没有材料之后，便带领工友到处搜集材料，经过三个月的工夫，修×、×号高炉的配管材料重要部分都搜集够用了。除了装配用去一半器材外，现在还存在有：铜气门一五一个，高压气门一六个，活接头八一个，里面接头四九个，接头一九五个，三通五七个，弯头七一六个，暖气伸缩接手一五个，螺丝四○○个，红色电丝五○米，铁丝二捆二十公斤。保险钢管二四条等。孟泰这样热爱祖国财产的精神感召了别人，在职工们的身上发生了很大的影响。
    改进技术，贯彻制度，全年没有发生责任事故
    孟泰一贯的关心工厂比关心自己的家和自己的生命还重要。去年冬天一个下大雪的晚上，孟泰在炕上就睡不着觉，思念工厂。老婆说：“你说梦话吗？”他说：“雪下得这样大，高炉水管冻了岂不耽误生产吗？”第二天一早就赶紧跑进工厂去检查水管。孟泰常常根据伪满发生事故的经验，日夜研究，想出办法改进了工作。例如水中矿物质经常沉淀在水管中，有碍水的循环，以致引起冷却设备被烧坏。他想出了办法，每月以胶皮管使用蒸气或冷风全部吹洗两次，使沉淀在水管中的杂质，被清去了。他又改进了出渣口环水节（冷却设备）技术，增加了一个进水管，因此冷却效率提高了，解决当时水的压力小的困难。孟泰同志又提出了“三保”“四勤”的口号。三保是：“保证不漏水、不漏风、不漏气”，四勤是：“勤看、勤走、勤检查、勤修理。”炼铁厂自复工以来相继有×个高炉开火，在高炉冷却设备附属品上来说，虽然都是废物利用的，但由于孟泰改进了技术，建立工作制度，并以身作则认真贯彻执行，所以配管工作全年没发生责任事故。
    一贯以忘我的精神，向工作中的困难作斗争
    孟泰一贯以忘我的精神与工作中的困难作斗争。他虽然五十多岁了，但是干起活来如同小伙子一样，对特别艰险的工作从来没有畏缩过，总是亲自动手干。如×高炉上中部管子有一次坏了，上面冒着瓦斯烟，他冒着危险，首先跑到上面进行修理。很多工友劝他下来（因高炉上中部很高，一旦瓦斯冒的很厉害，恐怕躲不及），但他始终坚持工作，一直把工作作完。有一次他被瓦斯熏倒了，负责同志去慰问他时，他刚醒过来便说：“这一点小事算不了什么。”他每当接受上级给他的任务时，他从不还价。上级有时怕他有困难，他总是笑着脸说：“这好办”，“没什么”。特别是接受按装原料贮矿槽保温管的任务时，天气已经很冷了，贮矿槽几乎就要冻结了，所以引起了全厂同志的注目。（因为贮矿槽的矿石，一旦冻结就不能给高炉输送矿石。这对影响生产是不堪设想的。）孟泰接受了这项紧急的任务，召集了全体工友讨论研究，须要一七○个工才能完成。由于天气冷度不断的增加，孟泰同志坐卧不安，下班时也不愿回去，时时在想办法如何争取提前完成。孟泰研究原来计划上保温管在转弯时切断按上接手，这样必须将每个管子头上套成螺丝扣，这不仅是浪费了人工而且也浪费了材料。因此孟泰把原来的计划改变了一下，把管子在转弯到另一个方向时，不套螺丝了，把他以氧焊焊上，这样就节省了三十个人工，而且节省了一百二十个弯头，提前完成了贮矿槽的保温任务。
    孟泰具有优秀的品质，光荣的参加了共产党
    孟泰具有工人阶级的优秀品质。他看到浪费国家资财的时候，心里非常难受。鞍钢从修复到生产的一年多过程中，孟泰创造出来的模范事迹简直难以说尽。他已先后被选为鞍钢的一等和特等功臣，三次受奖。
    孟泰从十九岁就从河北家乡飘落到东北作工，到现在已经有三十三年的工龄。这一个长时间痛苦的和悲惨的生活，已经把他磨练成为工人阶级坚强的优秀的一员。一九四八年二月鞍山解放后，孟泰已从一个普通工人提升为配管技术员。一九四九年八月，他光荣参加了中国共产党。
