Engineer Zhao Naibin Completes Duplex Steelmaking Method
    Li Zhuo, Ye Tao, Liu Ming

    The Tangshan Steel Plant had the remains of two iron smelting furnaces: a decaying cupola furnace body and the empty shell of a Bessemer converter. "Steel is the backbone of industry," and every effort should be made to get steel from any furnace possible. Therefore, furnace repair became the overriding central task of the steel plant.

    The higher authorities entrusted this task to engineer Zhao Naibin.

  Putting Down the Intellectual's Pretentions
    Zhao Naibin is a young engineer, 35 years old this year. He graduated from the Engineering College of Wuhan University during the Anti-Japanese War and later worked in state-run and private steel plants in Sichuan for two years, but then switched to teaching. After liberation, he came to the Tangshan Steel Plant. Due to his continuous ideological progress, he gradually put down the airs of an intellectual. As a result, he was able to humbly learn from the masses in his work, consult with workers on issues, work alongside them, and teach workers steelmaking techniques. The workers of the cupola and Bessemer furnaces, with the help of Zhao Naibin, gradually mastered the technology, and Zhao Naibin was loved by the workers. Everyone affectionately called him "Old Zhao."

  Repairing the Cupola Furnace
    Old Zhao planned to repair the cupola furnace first. When repairing the cupola furnace, the large chimney on top of the furnace needed to be bricked inside, but the top of the furnace was steep and there was no place to stand, and there were no "points of support" on all four sides, making rope ladders difficult to use. Just as everyone was worried, Old Zhao bravely climbed up the furnace and went into the chimney. After thinking about it carefully inside the chimney, he came down and discussed with the workers, deciding to drill holes in the steel shell of the blast furnace and erect iron bars and wooden boards for repairs. In two days, the chimney was completed, creating favorable conditions for firing the cupola furnace.

    During the first trial run of the cupola furnace after it was repaired, the molten iron boiled in the furnace, and thick smoke billowed from the top. The workers were both happy and excited. When it was time to tap the iron, just as they were about to start, they found that the tap hole had solidified. No matter how much they shook it, it wouldn't budge. The molten iron in the furnace boiled more and more, and the workers became more and more anxious. Old Zhao came over and hurriedly began to chisel the "tap hole" himself. The high heat of over 1,000 degrees Celsius pressed directly on Old Zhao, and sweat poured from the top of his head to his heels. Everyone worried that the molten iron would burn his skin. With a crash, the molten iron rushed out of the tap hole, and everyone was so happy that they lifted Old Zhao high into the air.

    The first batch of red-hot molten iron came out of the furnace, but the refractory bricks at the bottom couldn't withstand the erosion of the high-temperature molten iron. Some of the bricks peeled off, and the brick dust combined with the slag in the molten iron, solidifying in the furnace cavity and becoming "nodules" in the furnace cavity. Removing the "nodules" would damage the life of the furnace. At this time, Old Zhao worked with his fellow workers to remove the "nodules."

    Old Zhao took the lead and overcame a series of difficulties, and the cupola furnace began to tap iron normally.

  Bessemer Furnace Produces Steel
    The Bessemer furnace in the plant was originally built by the Japanese devils near the end of the Anti-Japanese War. The Japanese failed to start the furnace after several trials. After the Kuomintang came, they thought that if the Japanese couldn't do it, they certainly couldn't. So the furnace was abandoned. Old Zhao, leading ten young and strong workers with no experience, faced this Bessemer furnace that had been abandoned for more than four years and soaked in floodwater, and felt a little worried. Old Zhao studied the problem with people everywhere and finally drew up the drawings. He took them to the plant to discuss repair methods with the workers and personally guided them to work. The bricks inside the furnace were all damaged, so everyone took them out one by one and replaced them with new bricks. Old Zhao kept an eye on the furnace until midnight. Excessive fatigue caused him to fall asleep by the side of the furnace. When he woke up at dawn, he found that he was covered with a cotton coat, which a fellow worker had taken off and given to him.

    Old Zhao worked stubbornly by the Bessemer furnace, averaging less than four hours of sleep a day. He worked continuously for 30 hours seven times and continuously for 50 hours twice. The furnace was repaired, and the trial smelting was successful. The life of the Bessemer furnace was extended from 16 heats to 28 heats, and the time to smelt a heat of steel was reduced from one and a half hours to one hour.

    The steel production increased, but the quality was not good. When you broke a steel ingot, it was full of small pinholes. This was because the steel contained impurities and large amounts of sulfur and phosphorus. The Ministry of Heavy Industry sent people several times to suggest improving the steelmaking method: the molten steel made in the Bessemer furnace was poured into an electric arc furnace for another smelting. In this way, the impurities and sulfur and phosphorus could be treated to an ideal level, and the steel could be refined from inferior steel to high-grade steel. In the past, when the Bessemer furnace and the electric arc furnace each produced steel separately, the production figures were announced on the bulletin board every day. The workers saw their achievements and were both happy and excited, and everyone worked hard. This time, the two furnaces were combined to make steel, and only the electric arc furnace was seen to produce steel. The Bessemer furnace workers felt unwilling: "Why change? Let's just muddle along! If we don't change well, it will be a waste." Old Zhao was the leader of the Bessemer furnace group. He considered the higher authorities' call for the duplex steelmaking method and felt that this national innovation in the steel industry could be done. He energetically explained and persuaded the workers. Old Zhao had a high prestige among the masses, and everyone gradually understood the idea.

  Trial of Duplex Steelmaking Method Successful
    In the trial of the duplex steelmaking method, the first problem encountered by the Bessemer furnace was how long the molten steel should be smelted in the Bessemer furnace. In the past, when smelting alone, the flame on top of the Bessemer furnace would rise to the top and then start to fall, indicating that the molten steel was mature and could be sealed. This time, the duplex smelting electric arc furnace required the Bessemer furnace to retain 0.3% carbon in the molten steel, which meant that the blowing had to be stopped before the flame on top of the Bessemer furnace began to fall. Where could the "termination point" be found? No scale could be used, no computer could be used, and no old experience could be used. They had to slowly explore the experience. This time, Old Zhao led the workers, taking turns watching the flame on top of the furnace and listening to the sound of the molten steel boiling in the furnace. They changed shifts every eight hours, had a meeting every day, and held a conference every few days. You passed on your experience to me, and I passed on my experience to you. Old Zhao combined the workers' bits of experience with his own, and on a day in Red May, the "termination point" was finally found.

    But difficulties came one after another. The electric arc furnace was eight tons, but the Bessemer furnace was only three and a half tons. The Bessemer furnace had to produce two heats to supply one heat for the electric arc furnace. However, after the Bessemer furnace produced one heat, it needed to be hot-repaired, the hood slag removed, and the furnace nozzle replaced before it could continue to smelt the second heat. This delay in the middle would consume more electricity in the electric arc furnace. What to do? They had to race against time! Old Zhao immediately gathered the workers to brainstorm ideas. Zheng Shiheng suggested: instead of using hands to tamp sand when changing the furnace nozzle, use an air hammer, which would be both stronger and save time. Old Zhao also came up with the idea: before hot-repairing the furnace, mix the brick powder, silica stone, and slurry used for repairing the furnace in advance, and assign work to everyone. Start working as soon as the molten steel comes out to save time. As a result of everyone working in this way, the hot-repair time was shortened by more than 20 minutes.

    But problems arose after duplex smelting. The overheating zone of the furnace was often eroded into deep grooves by silicon, manganese, and carbon, which not only damaged the life of the furnace but also prolonged the blowing time. Old Zhao pondered how to solve this problem while eating and sleeping, and finally he came up with a solution. The Bessemer furnace started like a tank spitting fire. During the first blowing stage, Old Zhao asked the workers to tilt the furnace body five degrees so that the molten steel was below the tuyere bricks, and the overheating zone of the furnace would not be eroded by the blown-out iron oxide and manganese oxide. During the second blowing stage, he asked the workers to erect the furnace body because at this stage the slag in the furnace gradually rose to the tuyere line, and if it was not erected, it would definitely erode the tuyere bricks. In the third blowing stage, he found that the molten steel was rotating in the furnace, and erecting the furnace body would cause the flame to be interrupted. So he tilted the furnace body forward by seven degrees to allow air to enter the molten steel obliquely, causing the molten steel to have an up-and-down exchange effect, and the carbon flame rose vigorously. After the three blowing stages were completed, the red-hot molten steel came out of the furnace and poured into the electric arc furnace from the chute. The overheating zone of the furnace no longer had deep grooves, and the steel was produced six minutes faster than before. "Six minutes is victory!" Everyone shouted, clapping their hands. The factory director shook Old Zhao's hand and said: "We have a way to produce! This is the result of your cooperation with the workers!" (Attached picture)

　　完成双联炼钢法的工程师赵乃斌
    李卓　叶淘　刘明
    唐山制钢厂有两座熔铁炉的遗骸，一座是腐朽的化铁炉炉身，一座是贝斯麦炉空晃晃的炉壳。“钢铁是工业的脊骨”，能争取一座炉子出钢就不能松手。所以，修炉成为制钢厂压倒一切的中心任务。
    上级把这个任务交给了工程师赵乃斌。
  放下了知识分子的架子
    赵乃斌是一位年青的工程师，今年三十五岁，抗战期间毕业于武汉大学工学院，后曾在四川官营及私营的炼钢厂干过两年，但以后就改行教书去了。解放后他到唐山炼钢厂，由于他思想上不断的进步，逐渐放下了知识分子的架子，因而在工作中就能虚心向群众学习，有事就和工人商量，和工人在一起干活，教给工人炼钢技术。化铁炉和贝斯麦炉的工人，在赵乃斌的帮助下，逐渐学好了技术，赵乃斌也就受到了工人们的爱戴，大家伙都亲切地叫他“老赵”。
  修复化铁炉
    老赵打算先把化铁炉修复。在修化铁炉时，炉顶上的大烟筒需要往里砌砖，可是炉顶陡立，站不住人，四顶又没有“着力点”，绳梯不好用。大伙正着急，老赵却勇敢地爬上炉去钻进烟筒，在烟筒里琢磨停当，下来跟伙计们商量，决定用高炉铁壳上穿孔，架起铁棍木板来修。两天时间，烟筒搞好了，为化铁炉创设了升火的有利条件。
    化铁炉修好后第一次试炉时，铁水在炉里沸腾，炉顶上浓烟滚滚，伙计们心底又乐又热。该出铁水的时候，正当要动手，发现出铁嘴凝住了，凭你怎样摇晃也不顶事，炉里的铁水愈沸腾，伙计们的心愈急。老赵走来，急忙亲自动手凿“出铁嘴”，一千多度的高热直逼老赵，汗从头尖直流到脚跟，大伙担忧铁水会烙坏他的皮肉。哗啦一响，铁水从嘴里奔出来，大家乐得把老赵高高地举了起来。
    第一炉红红的铁水出了炉，可是炉底耐火砖经不起高热铁水浸蚀，有的砖掉了皮，砖末和铁水里的渣汁一结合，凝固在炉腔内，成为炉腔的“结核”，不扒去“结核”会损害炉子的寿命。老赵这时和工友一起操作，把“结核”扒出来。
    老赵领头干，克服了一连串的困难，化铁炉出铁正常了。
  贝斯麦炉出钢了
    再说厂内的贝斯麦炉，原是抗战快胜利时日寇造的，日本人试验几次开炉都没有成功。国民党来后，认为日本人都开不好，他们自己更觉得没那个本领，炉子便一直被弃置下来。老赵领着十个年青力壮没有经验的工人，面对着这荒废了四年多、又被大水泡过的贝斯麦炉，心里有点发愁。老赵到处和人研究，终于画好了图样，拿到场里和工友商量修理的办法，又亲自指导工友们干起来。炉里面的砖全坏了，大家把它一块块地取出来，又一块块地砌上新砖，老赵一直盯住炉子干到半夜，过度的疲劳，使他卧在炉边睡着了。天亮醒来，发现身上盖着棉衣，这是工友从身上脱给他的。
    老赵顽强地工作在贝斯麦炉旁，平均一天睡不到四小时，有七次连续工作三十小时，二次连续工作五十小时。炉修好，试炼也成功了，贝斯麦炉的寿命由十六炉延长到二十八炉，炼一炉钢的时间由一小时半缩短到一小时。
    钢的产量是增加了，但质量不好，打断钢锭一看，尽是细小的蜂孔，这是钢里含杂质及多量硫和磷的缘故。重工业部几次派人来提示改进炼钢法；把贝斯麦炉里炼好的钢水再灌进电弧炉里炼一次，这样杂质及硫磷可以处理到理想的程度，钢可以由次钢炼到高材钢。往日，贝斯麦炉及电弧炉各自单出钢的时候，布告牌上天天公布生产的数字，伙计们看到自己的成绩，心底又乐又热，个个蹩足劲干。这回两座炉合起来炼钢，只看见电弧炉出钢，贝斯麦炉工友们心里不甘：“改啥，凑合着干吧！改不好反倒白搭。”老赵是贝斯麦炉的组长，他把上级双联炼钢法的号召一合计，觉得这个全国炼钢工业上的创举可以行，一股劲儿向伙计解释、说服，老赵在群众中威信挺高，大伙的思想渐渐搞通了。
  试炼双联炼钢法成功
    试炼双联炼钢法，贝斯麦炉第一个遇到的难题是钢水要在贝斯麦炉里炼多久？以往单炼，贝斯麦炉炉顶上的火焰冒到顶尖开始往下坠时，表示钢水成熟，可以封炉。这回双炼电弧炉要求贝斯麦炉在钢水里保留千分之三的碳，就是说不等贝斯麦炉的火焰开始下坠就得停吹，往那儿找“终止点”呢？标尺用不上，计算机用不上，旧经验用不上，只好慢慢摸索经验。老赵这回领着伙计们，轮流盯着炉顶上的火焰，耳朵听炉里钢水沸腾的声响。八个钟点一交班，一天一碰头，几天一开会，你把经验传给我，我把经验传给你，老赵把伙计们点滴的经验汇在一起，再加上自己的经验，在红五月的一天里，“终止点”终于被找到了。
    但困难一件接着一件不断袭来。电弧炉是八吨的，贝斯麦炉却是三吨半的。贝斯麦炉必须出两炉才能供电弧炉一炉用。可是，贝斯麦炉出过一炉，需要经过热补炉、去掉罩棚渣子及换炉嘴以后，才能继续炼第二炉。这样中间一耽隔，就多消耗电弧炉用电。怎么办呢？要争取时间！老赵马上找工人们一起想办法。郑士恒建议：换炉嘴打砂不用手打，改用汽锤打，既结实又节省时间。老赵也想出：在热补炉前把补炉用的砖粉、英石、浆水先合好，并且大伙分好工，钢水一出就开始干，可以节省时间。大家这样干的结果，使热补炉的时间缩短二十多分钟。
    但双炼以后问题又来了，炉子的过热带常被矽锰炭浸蚀成深沟，这样不仅损害炉子的寿命，也要延长吹炼的时间。老赵吃饭、睡觉都在琢磨如何解决这问题，终于被他想出了办法。贝斯麦炉像坦克喷火开动了，在第一个吹炼时期，老赵叫工友把炉身放斜五度，这样可使钢水在风眼砖以下，炉子的过热带就不会被吹出的氧化铁、氧化锰浸蚀；在第二个吹炼时期，他叫工友将炉身直立，因为这时期炉内渣子逐渐上涨至风眼线上，若不直立定会浸蚀风眼砖。在第三个吹炼时期，他又发现钢水在炉里发生旋转作用，直立时会使火焰发生中断现象。于是又将炉身向前倾斜七度，使空气斜进钢水中，使钢水又发生一种上下交流作用，炭焰就熊熊上升。在三个吹炼时期完毕后，通红的钢水出炉了，从刨子中哗哗哗倾进电弧炉里。炉子的过热带不再有深沟，而且比以前出钢快六分钟。“六分钟就是胜利！”大伙拍着手叫着，厂长握着老赵的手说：“我们的生产有办法！这是你和工友们合作的结果！”（附图片）
