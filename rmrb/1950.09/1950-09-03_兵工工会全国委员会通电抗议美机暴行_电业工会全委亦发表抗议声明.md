　　The National Committee of the National Industrial Union
    Issues Circular Protesting U.S. Aircraft Atrocities
    The National Committee of the Electrical Workers' Union Also Issues Protest Statement
    [Report from this newspaper] The National Committee of the China National Industrial Union issued a circular protesting the U.S. aircraft's invasion of our country's airspace, calling on all industrial workers nationwide to actively produce and defend the national defense. The circular stated in brief: After reading the news reports about the U.S. aircraft's atrocities in Northeast China, we are extremely indignant. This barbaric act of the U.S. imperialists directly infringing upon our country's sovereignty and killing our people is a mad act of attempting to continue to invade our country and expand the war after exposing their disastrous defeat in Korea. We resolutely resist the aggression of U.S. imperialism, and we fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the U.S. government and the request to the United Nations Security Council. We call on all industrial workers nationwide to actively mobilize, work hard to produce, improve quality, strengthen vigilance, defend our national defense construction, and be prepared to contribute a large number of weapons at any time to support the People's Liberation Army, liberate our country's territory of Taiwan, maintain the integrity of national territorial sovereignty, and drive out U.S. imperialism.
    [Report from this newspaper] The National Committee of the China Electrical Workers' Union issued a statement protesting the U.S. aircraft's invasion of our country's airspace and strafing of our people, stating: The U.S. imperialists' mad dog-like attack on Korea and aggression against our country's Taiwan has aroused the indignation and protests of peace-loving people all over the world! On August 27, the U.S. imperialist aircraft again invaded our country's airspace and barbarously strafed our people; this shameless and beastly act is another act of aggression against the Chinese people following the U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan. We, on behalf of the electrical workers across the country, express our utmost anger, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest, and vow to take practical actions to smash the U.S. imperialists' aggression and defend lasting world peace!
