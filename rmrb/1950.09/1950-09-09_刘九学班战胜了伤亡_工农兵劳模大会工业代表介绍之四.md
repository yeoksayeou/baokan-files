　　Liu Jiuxue's Team Overcame Casualties

　　——Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Peasants, and Soldiers, Part Four
　　Du Wenyuan

　　The Liu Jiuxue Team of the No. 2 Factory of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine has created the glorious achievement of no casualties for nineteen months. The National Coal Mine Management Bureau issued certificates of merit and bonuses, calling them a model team for safe production.

　　Before liberation, no one cared about the safety of coal miners' lives. Liu Jiuxue, who had lived in the mine for thirty-two years, knew that mine safety was very important, but he could only talk about it at that time; in reality, he could not improve safety work. After liberation, "safe production" was regarded as the most important thing. Last October, the Mining Bureau vigorously carried out security work, and the Liu Jiuxue Team immediately strengthened production organization and elected a security team leader. After work or before work, they held review meetings to check engineering specifications and safety matters, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and through meetings, educated and enlightened the workers' attention to security work.

　　But at the beginning, they encountered resistance from conservative ideas. Worker Zhang Wanxiang didn't want to work, didn't want to attend meetings, and didn't want others to attend meetings. He said, "It's enough to earn money for the family, isn't attending meetings just earning those meager grains?" During working hours, he would work for a while and then find a quiet place to sleep. Worker Yuan Minghua said, "It's enough if I don't get hurt, what do I care about others?" Liu Jiuxue told him, "If the person pulling the basket gets hurt in your area, you are also responsible." He still didn't repair the shed pillars properly, so Liu Jiuxue personally went to repair them. He moved him with practical actions, educated him overtly and covertly, and criticized him at meetings. Finally, Yuan Minghua finally said, "Others are individuals, and I am also an individual, why do people always criticize me?" Then he began to express his willingness to make progress. Liu Jiuxue seized on this point and praised him in a timely manner. Yuan Minghua was elected as the security team leader. Liu Jiuxue paid great attention to uniting people with backward thinking, because if one person lags behind, there will be trouble.

　　After Yuan Minghua was elected as the security team leader, he was deeply afraid that he could not bear the security responsibility. Under Liu Jiuxue's guidance, he studied the "division of responsibility" method. It stipulated that the coal miner would be responsible for accidents in the working face, and the basket puller should report any damage to the shed. If it was reported and not repaired, the pillar support worker would be responsible. The basket puller should greet people to avoid bumping into them. Everyone had a clear scope of responsibility.

　　With clear responsibilities, it is also necessary to check frequently. When Liu Jiuxue went down the well, he always carried three things - a small stick, a wind lamp, and a flashlight. Tapping with the small stick, he could know whether it was hollow or slagging; the wind lamp tested the size of the gas; he used the flashlight to see if the shed was built well. Every day when he went to work, he checked it once first, and then assigned personnel according to the good or bad condition of the place. He checked it once in the middle of the work to see what difficulties there were and help solve them. When he was about to get off work, he looked at how the task was completed and how well the project was done. He was very strict in the implementation of the shift handover system, and paid special attention to the inspection of engineering specifications. He never took chances on engineering, and said, "Work must be done reliably."

　　Liu Jiuxue is a thirty-two-year-old veteran miner. With him as the core, he united the whole team, helped each other, and supervised each other. Large pieces of coal were difficult to pull, so the coal miners helped the basket pullers break the coal and helped them load the baskets. When doing large projects, everyone helped each other. Liu Jiuxue said, "No matter how much experience a person has, it is always a little uneasy to do it alone. If someone assists next to you, you will feel at ease." In the past, coal miners, pushcart workers, and basket pullers were oppressed layer by layer. Now they help each other and give play to the spirit of collectivism.

　　The Liu Jiuxue Team has six coal miners, four pushcart workers, five basket pullers, plus a blaster and the team leader, a total of seventeen people. The technical skills of his team members are not very high, but he is good at rationally allocating labor. Liu Jiuxue's legs are diligent, and he is very familiar with the situation in each gully in the well. He also knows everyone's skills and temperaments, and assigns tasks according to who can take on what task. If there is danger in a certain place, he will go to check it himself. In dangerous areas, he repeatedly told the workers to be careful of danger, or helped the workers to work until it was repaired. When the workers were tired, he would help them for a while so that the workers could eat some steamed buns and drink some water. If the workers had anything wrong, he would correct them in time.

　　The glorious achievement of no casualties for nineteen months is inseparable from Liu Jiuxue's daily selection and education of workers. At the beginning of the restoration of the Jiaozuo Coal Mine, the production order was very chaotic. Most of the workers were farmers who came to the mine during the slack farming season. If there was any danger in the well, they might not go to work for several days in a row. Without fixed long-term miners, the safety of the workers' lives would not be guaranteed. Starting from the safety of the workers' lives, Liu Jiuxue never casually introduced workers to work; he only introduced workers who really relied on coal mines for food to register. For the short-term workers who were already working, he tried to persuade them to become fixed. He once specifically accounted for Zhang Wanxiang: "Working as a miner for one day can earn more than ten kilograms of millet, and more than four hundred kilograms a month. How much can you harvest in a year by farming?" After persuasion, Zhang Wanxiang did not miss work for seven months. According to statistics from the past year and a half, the attendance rate of the Liu Jiuxue Team (that is, the ratio of the number of people who should be present to the number of people actually present) was 92.5%. The Liu Jiuxue Team is a neat production team, which has prepared good conditions for safe production.

　　Liu Jiuxue is forty-five years old this year, from Baishan Village, Bo'ai County, Pingyuan Province. His family was very poor. His father died when he was nine years old, so he went to the mine to find food (he worked as a hired laborer in the countryside for three years in between) and has been a miner ever since. In the old society, Liu Jiuxue had never heard of the word "security," and what was left to him was a body full of scars. That was in 1942. Liu Jiuxue was carrying a shed and was pressed underneath. A piece of wood was across his lower back, and a piece of wood was across his waist, sandwiching him in the middle, from ten o'clock in the morning until five o'clock in the afternoon. After others dug him out, he took a few steps, his breath relaxed, and he fell down at once. This was one of the many disasters Liu Jiuxue had experienced. Therefore, Liu Jiuxue deeply experienced the importance of security work to the workers. He often said: Now the workers are the masters, and we must pay attention to the safety of our masters. "If the top is equipped with ten people in the team, we must be responsible for the ten people. If we are equipped with twenty people, we are responsible for the twenty people." When there was no call to strengthen security work, he said to everyone, "Which family doesn't have three or five people? If anyone is injured, they will suffer, and the family will not be able to live." At that time, the iron hooks for pulling baskets were not very strong, and they would break and fall and get injured, so he used his own money to buy more reliable iron hooks for each young basket puller. There were fifteen- or sixteen-year-old young workers pulling baskets, and he would not let them work too hard, and often helped them load baskets.

　　Liu Jiuxue is diligent with his hands, mouth, and legs, and also diligently holds meetings and diligently checks. Therefore, he achieved no work-related injuries for nineteen months and exceeded the production task. From January last year to June this year, the average coal mining efficiency of the Liu Jiuxue Team was 1.3303 tons, exceeding the general work efficiency. When summarizing safe production in the first quarter of this year, the Liu Jiuxue Team was rewarded. In the Red May competition, it was selected as a model. At the miners' congress of the mine, it was decided to carry out the Liu Jiuxue safety campaign throughout the mine.

　　But Liu Jiuxue is not complacent. He knows that in today's coal mining methods throughout the mine are still very backward, it is necessary to further study technology, study culture, and continue to obtain the help of technical personnel in order to improve coal mining methods and strengthen workers' safety work.

　　刘九学班战胜了伤亡
    ——工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之四
    杜文远
    焦作煤矿二厂刘九学班，创造了十九个月无伤亡的光荣事迹。全国煤矿管理总局，颁发了奖状、奖金，称他们为安全生产模范班。
    解放前，煤矿工人的生命安全从来无人过问。过了三十二年矿坑生活的刘九学，虽深知矿山安全问题很重要，然而那时只能说说，实际上不能改善安全工作。解放后，“安全生产”才被提作头等重要的事。去年十月，矿务局大力开展保安工作，刘九学班立即加强生产组织，选举了保安组长。在下班后或上班前，开检讨会，检查工程规格与安全事宜，开展批评与自我批评，通过会议，教育与启发了工人对保安工作的注意。
    但开初就碰到保守思想的抵抗。工人张万祥自己不想干活，不想开会，也不想让别人开会，他说：“把钱挣到家里就算了，开会还不也是挣那些小米？”在工作时间，他干一阵子，就找个背静地方睡起来。工人袁明华说：“我自己不受伤就算了，管别人干什么？”刘九学告诉他：“在你这地方，拉筐的受了伤，你也要负责任。”他仍然不好好修理棚柱，刘九学就亲自去下手修理。以实际行动感动他，明里暗里教育他，会上批评他。最后袁明华终于说：“人家是个人，我也是个人，为啥老叫别人批评我？”才开始表示愿意进步。刘九学抓住这点及时进行了表扬。袁明华被选为保安小组长。刘九学很注意团结思想落后的人，因为有一个人落后，也会出乱子的。
    袁明华被选为保安小组长后，深怕自己负不起保安责任。在刘九学诱导下，研究出“分责任”的办法。规定了掌子有了事故由采煤工负责，拉筐的见棚坏了要报告。报告了，不修理，由支柱工人负责。拉筐的见了人要打招呼，以免碰伤。每个人都有了明确的责任范围。
    责任明确了，还要勤检查。刘九学下井，总带着三件东西——小棍、风灯和手电。小棍一敲，可知道是否空帮，掉渣；风灯试验煤气大小；用手电看棚搭的好坏。每天上班时，他先检查一遍，再根据地方好坏分配人员。工作中间检查一次，看有什么困难，帮助解决。快下班时，看任务完成的怎样，工程做的好坏。他对交接班制度的执行很严格，特别注意工程规格的检查。在工程上，他从不存“侥幸”心理，他说：“干活要干个牢靠。”
    刘九学是三十二年的老矿工，以他为核心，把全班团结起来，互相帮助，互相督促。大块的炭不好拉，掘煤工人就帮助拉筐的把煤打碎，并帮助他们装筐。在做大的工程时，大家来互助干，刘九学说：“一个人无论经验怎样多，干起来总是有些不塌实，如有人在旁边协助，心里就塌实了。”过去采煤工、推车工、拉筐工，一层压制一层，现在是互相帮助，发挥了集体主义精神。
    刘九学班有掘煤工六人，推车四人，拉筐五人，再加放炮员与班长，共十七人。他班的人员技术并不很高，但他善于合理的配备劳力。刘九学腿勤，对井下各个窝头情形很熟悉，他对大家的技术和脾气又摸的清，谁能担任什么任务，就分配什么任务。那一个地方有危险，自己就去检查。在危险地带，他三遍五遍的嘱咐工人要留心出危险，或者帮助工人做活，一直到修好为止。工人累了，他就帮助干一会，让工人吃口馍，喝点水。工人有不对的地方，他及时予以批评纠正。
    十九个月无伤亡的光荣事迹，是和刘九学日常对工人的选拔教育分不开的。焦作煤矿恢复之初，生产秩序非常混乱，工人多半是农闲期间到矿上来的农民，井下一有危险，也可能一连几天不上班。没有固定的长期矿工，工人的生命安全就无保证。刘九学从工人的生命安全出发，决不随便介绍工人上工；真正靠煤矿吃饭的工人，他才介绍去登记。对于已上班的短期工人，他设法劝导，使其固定。他曾和张万祥具体算账：“干一天矿工能赚十多斤小米，一月就赚四百多斤。种地你一年能收多少？”经过劝导，张万祥七个月没有旷工。据过去一年半统计，刘九学班出勤率（即应到人数与实到人数的比率）为百分之九十二点五。刘九学班是一支整齐的生产队伍，为安全生产准备了良好条件。
    刘九学今年四十五岁，平原省博爱县柏山村人，家中很穷，九岁时死了父亲，就到矿场混饭吃（中间曾到农村当了三年雇工），一直当矿工。在旧社会里，刘九学没听过“保安”这字样，留给他的是满身伤疤。那是一九四二年，刘九学抬棚被压在下面，腰下横着一根木头，腰上一根木头，把他夹在中间，从上午十点钟一直压到下午五点钟。旁人把他刨出来后，走了没几步，气一松，一下就跌倒了。这是刘九学经历过许多次灾难中的一次。因此刘九学深深体验到保安工作对工人的重要，他常说：现在工人是主人，不能不注意咱们主人的安全，“上边配备组里十个人，就得负十个人的责任，配备二十个人，就是二十个人的责任。”在没有号召加强保安工作时，他对大家说：“谁家没有三口五口的，伤着谁，谁也要受苦，家里的日子也没法过。”那时拉筐的铁钩很不牢靠，一断就要跌倒碰伤，他就用自己的钱，给每个拉筐的青年工人，买了更牢靠的铁钩。拉筐的有十五、六岁的青工，他不让他们干的太累了，常帮助他们装筐。
    刘九学手勤、嘴勤、腿勤，又加上一个勤开会，勤检查，因此做到十九个月没有公伤，并超过了生产任务。从去年一月份至今年六月，刘九学班的平均采煤效率为一点三三○三吨，超过了一般工作效率。今年第一季总结安全生产时，刘九学班受到奖励。红五月竞赛，又被选为模范。在该矿工代会上，曾决定在全矿开展刘九学安全运动。
    但是刘九学并不自满。他知道在全矿采煤方法还很落后的今天，需要更进一步学习技术，学习文化，继续取得技术人员的帮助，以便改进采煤方法，加强工人安全工作。
