Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: The final agenda for the 49th Annual Conference of the Labour Party, scheduled to begin on October 2nd in Margate, Kent, England, has been announced. According to a TASS dispatch from London: the agenda includes amendments from local Labour Party organizations to the various motions initially released on July 25th. Many of these amendments express concern over the development of the US intervention in Korea and Taiwan, and advocate for representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the United Nations Security Council.

For example, the amendments proposed by the Labour Party organizations of Holborn South St. Pancras (North London) and Stroud and Thornbury in Gloucestershire unanimously advocate for the People's Republic of China to be represented at the Security Council, for the withdrawal of US troops from Taiwan, and for the cessation of the Korean War.

The amendment proposed by the Labour Party organization of Widnes, Lancashire, argues that Britain should state to the Security Council that "MacArthur's discussions with Chiang Kai-shek regarding military plans for Taiwan constitute interference in China's civil war." The amendment also states: "The Beijing government, which the British government has already recognized, should represent China in the United Nations organization."

    【新华社十四日讯】定于十月二日起在英国肯特郡马尔加特举行的工党第四十九次年会的最后议程业已公布。据塔斯社伦敦讯：议程中包括工党各地方组织对七月二十五日初步发表的各项议案的修正案，其中有许多修正案对美国干涉朝鲜和台湾事件的发展表示忧虑，并主张中华人民共和国代表出席联合国安全理事会。
    例如，荷蓬南圣潘克拉斯（伦敦北区）以及格罗斯忒郡的斯特劳德和索恩巴利的工党组织所提出的各修正案中，一致主张中华人民共和国以代表出席安全理事会，美军自台湾撤退，并制止朝鲜战争。
    兰开夏郡威得内斯的工党组织提出的修正案，主张英国应向安理会表明：“麦克阿瑟与蒋介石讨论关于台湾的军事计划，乃是干涉中国的内战。”修正案并称：“英国政府已经承认的北京政府，应该代表中国出席联合国组织。”
