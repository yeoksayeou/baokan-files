　　US Imperialists Forcibly Conscript Laborers in Japan
    Forcibly Recruit Workers to Send to Korea as Cannon Fodder
    [Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch] TASS, 13th Dispatch, citing Tokyo newspapers: The work of forcibly recruiting harbor and dock workers to be sent to Korea is being carried out in Japanese ports such as Yokohama, Otaru, Hakodate, Nagoya, Kure, Sasebo, Moji, Maizuru, Niigata, and Toyama. The newspaper specifically mentioned the experiences of forty fishermen from the Tokoname (transliteration) area of Toyama Prefecture. These fishermen had expressed their willingness to become harbor workers, so they were taken to Yokohama on the 4th. After they heard from the local government's labor section that they would be hired by the military authorities and sent to Korea, they requested to be sent home. However, they were sent to a concentration camp in the Port of Yokohama, where they were under strict guard. Later, six fishermen escaped and reported the matter to the Nakagawa Labor Union Council. The council issued a statement protesting the forced recruitment of workers to be sent to Korea.

　　美帝在日本强拉壮丁
    强迫招募工人送赴朝鲜当炮灰
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社十三日电引东京报纸消息：强迫招募送往朝鲜的海港工人和码头工人的工作，正在横滨、小樽、函馆，名古屋、吴港、佐世保、门司、舞鹤、新泻和富山等日本港口进行。报纸特别提到富山县常生（译音）地方的四十名渔夫的遭遇。这些渔夫曾表示愿意成为海港工人，因此在四日被带到横滨。他们在当地政府的劳工科里听说他们将由军事当局雇用，并将派往朝鲜后，即要求送他们回家。但是他们却被送交横滨港的集中营，受着严格的看管。后来，六个渔夫逃了出来，并向中川的工会协议会报告这件事情。该协议会发表声明，抗议强迫招募送往朝鲜的工人。
