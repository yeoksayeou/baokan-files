　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch:
　　Moscow, September 1st (via TASS) - The World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY) delegation, en route to visit New China via Moscow, met with Moscow youth at the Trade Union Building on August 31st. More than two thousand people, including workers, students, and scientific workers from Moscow, attended the meeting. The delegation received a warm welcome upon arrival.

　　Konstantin Kuznetsov, Secretary of the Moscow Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, delivered a welcoming speech to the distinguished guests, expressing that Soviet youth stand together with democratic youth around the world, resolutely demanding an immediate end to intervention in Korea and the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea.

　　Bugala, head of the WFDY delegation, conveyed the greetings of 70 million youth from the World Federation of Democratic Youth to the people of Moscow. Bugala said: Moscow is the hope of all working people. It is not only the hope of Soviet youth but also the hope of youth worldwide.

　　Bugala continued: Imperialists attempt to sabotage the activities of young peace advocates, imprisoning or persecuting the leaders of the movement. But this does not indicate the strength of the imperialists; rather, it reveals their weakness. They will gain nothing from this approach but will only strengthen the struggle of democratic youth worldwide. Today, we need more than ever to prevent the implementation of the imperialists' criminal plans. The events in Korea have revealed the truth to many. The growing and expanding movement in support of the heroic Korean people is underway. We, along with millions of young men and women, demand an end to American intervention and an end to the bombing of Korea.

　　Bugala concluded: The democratic youth of all countries unanimously support the Soviet Union's peace proposal to fight against imperialist interference in Korean internal affairs.

　　Democratic youth representatives from France, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Cuba, and the United States delivered speeches in succession.

　　Mike McCann, the representative of progressive youth in the United States, said: I bring the message of peace from American youth. They need peace as much as the youth of other countries. American youth will never be exploited as cannon fodder in imperialist wars of aggression. They demand an end to the barbaric bombing of peaceful cities and villages in Korea and firmly demand that interference in Korea not be allowed.

　　The conference proceeded in a warm atmosphere. Speakers at the meeting also included Shumilin, a Stakhanovite worker from the "Red Proletarian" factory; Shamshina, a student at Moscow University; Kovaleva, an actress from the Moscow Art Theatre; and Kozimasov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, among others.

　　莫斯科两千余人举行盛会欢迎世界青联访华代表团
    各国青年代表一致痛斥美国侵朝
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：道经莫斯科前往新中国参观访问的世界民主青年联盟代表团，于八月三十一日在职工会大厦与莫斯科的青年会晤。与会者有莫斯科的工人、学生与科学工作者两千余人。代表团到会时受到了热烈的欢迎。
    苏联共产主义青年团莫斯科委员会书记康士坦丁·库兹涅卓夫向贵宾致欢迎辞，表示苏联青年和全世界民主青年在一起，坚决要求立即停止干涉朝鲜并自朝鲜撤退外国军队。
    世界青联代表团团长布加拉代表世界青联的七千万青年向莫斯科人民致敬。布加拉说：莫斯科是全体劳动人民的希望。它不仅是苏联青年的希望，也是全世界青年的希望。
    布加拉继称：帝国主义者企图破坏青年和平拥护者的活动，把运动的领袖加以禁闭或迫害。但这并不表示帝国主义者的强大，而是表现了他们的软弱。他们这种作法什么也不会获得，只能加强全世界民主青年的斗争。今天，我们比以往更需要阻止帝国主义者犯罪计划的实现。朝鲜的事件已经使许多人看到了真相。声援英勇朝鲜人民的壮大的运动正在增长与扩大。我们跟千百万的青年男女一道要求制止美国的干涉行动，制止对朝鲜的轰炸。
    布加拉在结语中说：各国的民主青年一致支持苏联所提出的为反对帝国主义者干涉朝鲜内政而斗争的和平建议。
    法国、保加利亚、越南、古巴和美国的民主青年代表相继发表了演说。
    美国进步青年代表麦克堪恩说：我带来了美国青年的和平的音信。他们像其他国家的青年一样地需要和平。美国青年决不被人利用作帝国主义掠夺战争中的炮灰。他们要求制止对朝鲜和平城乡的野蛮轰炸并坚决要求不许干涉朝鲜。
    大会在热烈的气氛中进行。在会上发言的尚有“红色无产者”工厂的斯塔哈诺夫式工人舒密林，莫斯科大学学生夏姆希娜，莫斯科艺术剧院的女演员科瓦列娃和苏联共产主义青年团中央委员会书记科齐马索夫等人。
