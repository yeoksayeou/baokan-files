　　I Chose Peace
    John Peet
    V
    During the so-called "blockade" of 1948-1949, West Berlin became a veritable paradise for spies and secret agents. The American, British, and French occupying authorities cooperated with each other on the same anti-Soviet front, the purpose of which was the infamous "Western Defense." But at the same time, the three countries were constantly fighting each other. Each of the three countries had its own spy network; its mission was not only to spy on East Germany and the Soviet occupation forces in East Germany, but also to monitor each other.
    American spies eavesdropped on British telephones—and some responsible British officials, as is well known, accepted American money; the staff of the French Second Bureau (i.e., the spy agency—editor's note from Wenxuebao) appeared confused in the three-way detective network. At the same time, none of the three Western commanders in Berlin was willing to inform the others about even the most trivial matters.
    Espionage work in the American-occupied zone was more thorough, because almost every American administrative department had its own very active espionage department.
    At that time, a news agency spread the news that the Soviet side seemed to be making military deployments. The source of this news was "American officers doing intelligence work." I tried my best to find the source of this news. But everyone I found immediately sent me to someone else. At the U.S. Army Intelligence Office, they said to me: "We have nothing to do with this matter. Go and ask Lieutenant X of the Naval Intelligence Office."
    Lieutenant X also completely denied being involved in this matter, and advised me to ask the State Department. But there, I was sent to another agency again. Therefore, I still couldn't figure out whether this news was spread by an officer doing intelligence work or the result of the fantasy of an American journalist.
    The competition between espionage organizations often leads to mutual attacks. But this situation by no means means that the Western powers' subversion and espionage activities against East Germany are not extremely dangerous factors.
    In conversations with senior British and American officials, I often heard that one of the reasons why the Western occupying authorities would not give up Berlin was that the city was "the best stronghold for monitoring Eastern Europe," in other words, an exceptionally suitable spy center. Berlin's geographical location, right in the heart of the German Democratic Republic, is conducive to organizing intelligence and any form of sabotage—from arson of large enterprises to subverting the Republic's economy through smuggling and looting of metals that are extremely necessary for industry.
    West Berlin is also a base used by the United States, Britain, and France to conduct anti-Soviet espionage activities.
    I came across an example of this kind of espionage purely by accident. An employee of the British military agency (the so-called "Lancaster House") asked me to talk about buying my car.
    I saw Soviet maps densely hanging on the wall of his office. The table was full of floor plans of many Soviet cities and even factories. In the conversation, he said that he was interrogating a group of German prisoners of war who had returned from the Soviet Union to West Berlin.
    "We can get the best news from them about the cities and enterprises where they worked"—he explained. So he showed me an exceptionally detailed floor plan of a factory, with side-line markings and an index of the product styles of each workshop.
    German spies play a major role in the spy networks of the Western powers. Many of these Germans are former National Socialist Party members or personnel from Nazi spy organizations.
    Some journalists also have direct connections with the spy organizations of the Western powers. Some of my colleagues often want to complete some "special tasks." Journalists from those Western newspapers, when attending the Leipzig Fair or going to the German Democratic Republic for other events, are often summoned to some British or American agencies for detailed inquiries.
    The occupying authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France do not agree on almost all issues regarding the occupation. The main point is that the British and French resist the arrogant Americans, because these Americans believe that the policies of the Western powers should only be decided by the United States.
    However, despite the frequent contradictions between the Western occupying authorities, there is one point on which they agree: the residents of West Berlin must be made to "resolutely oppose the dangers from the East." The local government and newspapers in the western district of Berlin, together with the occupying authorities of the Western powers, have used any reason to fire all employees with progressive tendencies, slander the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union, and do everything possible to turn West Berlin into a den of warmongers.
    But what about the actions of foreign journalists during this period? In private conversations, many journalists admitted that undisguised military propaganda was being carried out in Berlin, and that the Western powers had only one sensible way out: to withdraw their troops from Berlin, and then completely withdraw the occupying forces stationed in Germany, so that Germany could be reunited. However, due to cowardice, greed, and prejudice, we continued to spread to the world the lies fabricated by the United States about the Western powers "defending poor little Berlin from the Russian bear."

　　我选择了和平
    约翰·皮特
    五
    在一九四八——一九四九年所谓“封锁”期间，西柏林变成了各种间谍与暗探的真正天堂。美、英、法三国占领当局在同一的反苏阵线上互相合作，这一阵线的目的就是恶名昭著的“西方防御”。但同时三国彼此间却进行着经常的斗争。三国中每国都设有自己的间谍网；那使命不仅是刺探东德及苏联在东德的占领军情况，而且还有彼此相互的监视。
    美国间谍偷听着英国电话——而有些负责的英国职员，如众所周知，接受着美国人的钱；法国第二局（即间谍机关——文学报编者注）的工作人员在三方面的侦探网中显得迷乱，同时，柏林的三个西方司令官，甚至连最微不足道的事情也没有一个人肯告知别人。
    美占区的间谍工作更加周密，因为几乎每一个美国行政部门都有本身极活跃的间谍部。
    当时一个通讯社散布消息说，苏联方面似乎作着军事部署，这一消息的来源是“做情报工作的美国军官”。我竭力想找出这一消息的来源。但是我所找到任何一个人，都立刻把我打发到另一个人那儿。在美国陆军情报处，他们向我说：“我们与这件事没有关系。你去问一下海军情报处的Ｘ少尉”。
    Ｘ少尉也完全否认自己与这件事有关，而劝我去问一下国务部。但在那里，我又被打发到另外一个机关去了。因此，我毕竟弄不清楚这条消息是做情报工作的军官所散布的呢，还是某一美国新闻记者的幻想的结果。
    间谍组织的彼此竞争时常引起相互的攻击。但这个情况决不意味着西方强国反对东德的颠覆活动和间谍工作不是极端危险的因素。
    在与英、美高级官员的谈话中间，我时常听到西方占领当局不放弃柏林的原因之一，就在这个城市是“监视东欧的最好据点”，换句话说，就是一个异常适合的间谍中心。柏林的地理位置正在德意志民主共和国的心脏，利于组织情报及任何形式的破坏活动——从放火焚烧大企业以至通过了走私和对工业上异常必需的金属的掠夺等手段来颠覆共和国的经济。
    西柏林同时也是美、英、法所利用的进行着反苏间谍活动的基地。
    我完全出于偶然地碰到过这种间谍活动的一个例子。不列颠军事机关（即所谓的“兰卡斯德房子”）的一个职员，约我去谈一下关于购买我的汽车的事情。
    我看见他的办公室墙上密密地挂着苏联地图。桌子上放满着苏联的许多城市甚至工厂的平面图。在谈话中间，他说到他正在审问一批从苏联回到西柏林的德国俘虏。
    “从他们的口头可以得到他们工作过的一些城市及企业的最好消息”——他这样解释说。于是他指给我看一个工厂的异常详细的平面图，这个图附有侧线标志和每个车间产品样式的指图。
    在西方列强的间谍网中，德国间谍们起着很大的作用。这些德国人很多是从前的国社党员或纳粹间谍组织中的人员。
    有一些记者也与西方列强的间谍组织有着直接的联系。我的一些同业们时常想完成一些“特殊任务”。那些西方报纸的记者们，在参加莱比锡展览会，或为其他事件到德意志民主共和国的时候，常被召唤到英、美的什么机关，加以详细的询问。
    英、美、法三国占领当局在关于占领的几乎一切问题上意见并不一致，主要点就在英国人与法国人抵抗傲慢的美国人。因为这些美国人认为西方列强的政策只有由美国来决定。
    但是，西方占领当局之间尽管时常有着矛盾，却有一点是一致的：必须使西柏林居民“坚决反对东部的危险”。柏林西区的地方政权和报纸，和西方列强占领当局，都利用了任何原因开除一切有进步倾向的职工，诽谤德意志民主共和国和苏联，并尽一切可能使西柏林变为战争贩子的巢穴。
    但是在这个时期，外国记者们的举动怎样呢？在私人的谈话中间，许多记者都承认柏林进行着无法掩饰的军事宣传，承认西方列强只有唯一的有见识的出路：就是从柏林撤出军队，接着再把驻在德国的占领军完全撤退，使德国重新成为统一国家。然而，由于怯懦，由于贪欲，由于偏见，我们还是把美国所捏造的关于西方列强“保卫着可怜的小柏林来防避俄国熊”的谎言，连续传布于全世界了。（待续）
