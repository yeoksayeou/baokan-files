The Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government is sponsoring the Photo Exhibition of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Struggle in celebration of the 5th anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The exhibition is scheduled to open on September 2nd at the Yuexin Hall in Beihai Park and will close on September 7th. The exhibits are mainly photographs, including the atrocities of the French imperialists in Vietnam, the heroic resistance of the Vietnamese people, and the political, economic, and cultural activities of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The exhibition vividly introduces the Vietnamese people's struggle to liberate themselves and fight against the French imperialist invasion, regardless of all sacrifices. From their heroic struggle, we can see that Vietnam will eventually achieve complete liberation, the failure of French imperialism is doomed, and the final victory will belong to the Vietnamese people.

The exhibition's photos first introduce the Vietnamese revolutionary anniversary. In August 1945, the Vietnamese revolution was launched in Hanoi, unfolding the struggle against French imperialism. On September 2nd of the same year, the first people's regime in Vietnamese history, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, was formally established. In order to resist the French imperialists' launch of a war of aggression, the Vietnamese people used a scorched-earth policy to deal with the French colonialists. People in various places organized guerrillas and militias, launched a full-scale war of resistance, and attacked the enemy. Under the pressure of the powerful Vietnamese people's forces, French colonialists are weakening day by day.

The sixth collection of pictures shows the daily life of the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army, telling us how the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party, educate and train their army, how they help the people with their work, and the cooperation between the army and the people. The seventh and eighth collections of photos introduce the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army's armed equipment and flexible strategies and tactics for attacking the enemy, as well as the huge losses suffered by the French invading army under the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army's feigned attacks.

The Vietnamese People's Liberation Army's struggle for justice and independence has won the sympathy and assistance of the people of many countries around the world. Many international friends have volunteered to join the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army to help the Vietnamese people resist French imperialism. At the same time, many soldiers from France and other European countries (including former Nazis) who joined the French colonial army were completely deceived by the distorted propaganda of imperialism, or were forced to fight the Vietnamese people. Therefore, the Vietnamese people used various methods to awaken them. They then defected to the People's Liberation Army in batches, turning their guns around and fighting alongside the Vietnamese People's Liberation Army to eliminate the common enemy.

In the eleventh collection of photos, we see how workers in Vietnam's rudimentary arsenals are working hard to manufacture munitions to supply the People's Liberation Army, and how the People's Liberation Army seizes enemy weapons to arm themselves.

In terms of economy, the government of the Republic of Vietnam has implemented three major principles of economic policy since the beginning of the war of resistance, namely (1) strengthening agricultural and handicraft production; (2) restricting the consumption of imported goods; and (3) implementing thrift in all departments. On the one hand, due to the government's thorough implementation of this policy, and on the other hand, due to close cooperation with the people, the difficulties of Vietnam's wartime economy have been overcome.

Due to the obscurantist policies of the French colonialists and Japanese imperialists, education in Vietnam was relatively unpopular in the past. The Republic of Vietnam is carrying out compulsory education and eliminating illiteracy while resisting the war. By the end of 1949, 1,500,000 men and women had been freed from illiteracy. In this type of photo, we can see the Vietnamese people happily learning revolutionary theory and cultural knowledge.

Under the imperialist blockade, Vietnam was short of medicine, and the Ministry of Public Health made its best efforts to establish many pharmaceutical laboratories to overcome this difficulty.

The Democratic Republic of Vietnam also attaches great importance to the education of the future masters of Vietnam and the Young Pioneers. Children live happy and fulfilling lives.

Vietnam's war of resistance is comprehensive, and Vietnamese women also actively participate in production and work on the front lines. Their contribution to the Vietnamese war of resistance is no less than that of men.

Several charts are also hung in the venue, with statistics on the achievements of Vietnam's war of resistance and the economy. The materials are extremely valuable. The last part is Vietnamese books and newspapers, which can be used as reference for experts. The printing aspect is similar to the publications of our anti-Japanese base areas in the past, which makes us more imaginable of the arduous struggle of the Vietnamese people.

Although this exhibition is not large in scale, the materials are very valuable. At a time when the US imperialists and reactionaries are stepping up their aggression in Southeast Asia, these photos tell us how the Vietnamese people are carrying out their anti-imperialist struggle and shouldering such a major task in the movement to defend world peace.

### 越南人民解放斗争图片展览会介绍

　　越南人民解放斗争图片展览会介绍
    中央人民政府文化部，为庆祝越南民主共和国成立五周年纪念，特主办越南人民解放斗争图片展览会。展览会定于九月二日在北海公园悦心殿开幕，九月七日闭幕。展览品以图片为主，内容包括法帝在越南的暴行、越南人民的英勇抗战以及越南民主共和国政治、经济、文化等方面活动的情形。该展览会生动地介绍了越南人民不顾一切牺牲，反抗法帝的侵略，进行解放自己的独立斗争。从他们的英勇斗争中，我们可以看出来越南终久要得到全部的解放，法帝国主义的失败是注定的，最后的胜利必属于越南人民。
    展览会照片首先介绍了越南的革命纪念日。一九四五年八月越南革命在河内发动，展开反抗法国帝国主义的斗争，同年九月二日越南史上第一个人民政权——越南民主共和国正式成立。为了抵抗法帝发动侵略战争，越南人民以焦土抗战政策来对付法帝殖民主义者。各地人民组织游击队和民兵，发动全面抗战，打击敌人。在强大的越南人民力量的压力下，法帝殖民主义者正在一天一天消弱下去。
    图片的第六辑是越南人民解放军的日常生活情形，它告诉我们越南人民在越南共产党领导下如何教育和训练他们的军队，如何帮助人民工作以及军民合作等等情形。第七辑和第八辑的照片又介绍了越南人民解放军的武装配备和进攻敌人的灵活的战略战术以及在人民解放军声东击西的打击下，法国侵略军遭受到巨大的损失。
    越南人民解放军为正义、为争取独立的斗争，得到了世界上许多国家人民的同情和援助。不少国际朋友自愿参加越南人民解放军，帮助越南人民反抗法帝。同时许多参加法国殖民军的法国和欧洲其他国家（包括前纳粹）的士兵是完全受了帝国主义的歪曲宣传的欺骗，或者是被迫来和越南人民作战的，因此越南人民用种种方法来唤醒他们。他们便一批一批投到人民解放军来，倒转枪口与越南人民解放军并肩作战，消灭共同敌人。
    在第十一辑的照片里，我们看到越南规模粗具的兵工厂的工人如何努力制造军火来供应人民解放军，同时人民解放军如何夺取敌人的武器来武装自己。
    在经济方面，越南共和国政府从抗战开始就实行着经济政策的三大原则，就是（一）加强农业和手工业的生产；（二）限制进口货物的消耗；（三）各部门实行节约。一方面由于政府的彻底实行这种政策，一方面由于和人民的密切合作，克服了越南战时经济的困难。
    由于法国殖民主义者和日本帝国主义者的愚民政策，越南的教育在过去比较不普及。越南共和国一面抗战，一面进行义务教育，扫除文盲。一九四九年底，已扫除男女文盲一一、五○○、○○○人。在这一类的照片上，我们可看到越南人民在愉快地学习革命理论和文化知识。
    在帝国主义的封锁下，越南的医药缺乏，公共卫生部以最大的努力创立了许多制药实验室，克服了这方面的困难。
    越南民主共和国对于未来的越南主人翁和少年先锋队的教育也非常重视。儿童过着愉快幸福的生活。
    越南的抗战是全面的，越南的妇女也积极参加生产，实地参加战地工作。对于越南的抗战的供献并不亚于男子。
    会场里还挂着几张图表，是关于越南抗战的成果和经济方面的统计，材料极其珍贵。最后一部分是越南文的书报，可以供专家的参考。印刷方面和我们过去抗日根据地的出版品相似，更可想见越南人民坚苦奋斗的情形。
    这次展览会虽然规模不大，但材料很宝贵，在此美帝和反动派加紧侵略东南亚的时候，这些照片告诉我们：越南人民如何在进行着反帝的斗争，并在保卫世界和平运动中担负着如何重大的任务。
