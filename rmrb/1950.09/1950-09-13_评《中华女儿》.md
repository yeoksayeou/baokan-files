　　Review of "Daughter of China"
    Lie Valamov
    (Honored Art Worker of the Soviet Union)

    "Do I look like a soldier?" a daughter of the Chinese people asks.

    "We've already enlisted you as a soldier in the Thirteenth Platoon," the guerrilla instructor replies.

    "Let's all join the guerrillas!..."

    This happened in 1931.

    From the film "Daughter of China," produced by the Northeast Film Studio, we see scenes of the Chinese people's great revolutionary struggle. I have met with the entire crew that made this film. "Daughter of China"—is not a documentary, but it was born in the flames of the Chinese people's liberation movement, and its creators are participants in the great battles and the Long March. They don't need to act or study documents; they are simply recalling past experiences in this film.

    The patriotic women of China—mothers, wives, sisters—shared hardships with their fathers, husbands, and brothers, dedicating all their strength to the cause of the Chinese people both behind the lines and at the front. From the image of female instructor Leng Yun (who grew from a rural school teacher to a guerrilla leader), we can see many such Chinese women. In the film, the scene where Leng Yun and her lover Zhou—a guerrilla captain who accepts the task assigned to him by the Party to do underground work—part ways is simple yet moving. During these difficult days of guerrilla warfare, Leng Yun used her own heroic and firm will to inspire the soldiers of the unit. She heroically endured the news of the sacrifice of Captain Zhou, her lover. When the guerrillas are threatened by deadly danger, she and her female comrades turn the enemy's attack towards themselves in order to save the main force of the unit. She sacrificed herself, but her death became a banner for future victory.

    The actress Yue Shen, who plays the instructor Leng Yun, reminds Soviet audiences of the immortal achievements of the daughters of the Russian people.

    Audiences love the female guerrilla fighter Hu Xiuzhi. The fact that her husband, who was bedridden with illness, was burned to death in their poor house by the invaders did not destroy the spiritual strength of a simple peasant woman. She turned grief into anger. Great hatred led her to join the guerrillas. She performed outstanding feats in battle and eventually joined the Communist Party of China.

    "I swear," she said, "to absolutely obey the Party's decisions, to fight to the end for the proletarian cause, to keep the Party's secrets, and never to betray the Party."

    In the film, along with the patriotic women of China, there is a lovely image of a Korean girl named An. Wherever she is, the girl named An always believes that fighting against the invaders is her own sacred duty.

    "We, the Koreans, also do not want to be slaves," the female Korean guerrilla fighter named An said to her Chinese female comrades. On the days when the film showing the glorious story of the Chinese people's struggle for independence is shown on our screens, we know that the brothers and sisters of the Korean girl named An, who are fighting against American imperialism, are shouting:

    "Down with the American invaders!"

    They believe they will win, just as the Chinese people won in the sacred war for freedom. I am truly happy: I was able to see on Chinese soil the historically significant victorious battles of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and its leader Mao Zedong.

    The young Chinese cinema, born in the flames of the liberation struggle, already has a contingent of talented directors, actors, cinematographers, and artists from the people and wholeheartedly loyal to the people, replacing the Kuomintang cinema, which was stained with the corrupt spirit of Hollywood. A new, progressive people's cinematic art has arrived. This is why this film is full of true realism, simple, and inspiring spirit.

    Everything here is natural and simple, and the greatness of truth can be seen everywhere. Although the film reflects the many hardships, difficulties, and poverty experienced by the Chinese people in the severe years of fighting against the Japanese invaders, the film "Daughter of China" inspires people to victory with feelings of optimism, confidence, and strong will. At the Prague International Film Festival film competition, it won the "Award for the Struggle for Freedom."

    The brilliant names of those Chinese sons and daughters who established immortal merits for saving and reviving the nation will forever remain in the memories of freedom-loving people of all countries.

    "Communism is irresistible! A single spark can start a prairie fire! Long live the martyrs!"

    The true patriotic film "Daughter of China" is inspired by these words of Mao Zedong.

　　评《中华女儿》
    列·瓦尔拉莫夫
    （苏联功勋艺术工作者）
    “我像战士吗？”一个中华人民的女儿这样问。
    “我们已经把你编为第十三班战士了，”游击队的指导员这样回答她。
    “我们都去参加游击队吧！……”
    这是一九三一年的事情。
    从东北电影制片厂所摄制的《中华女儿》影片中，我们看到了中国人民伟大革命斗争的情景。我曾经和摄制这部影片的全体人员会面过。《中华女儿》——不是记录片，然而它是在中国人民解放运动的炮火中产生的，它的创作者们就是伟大战斗和长征的参加者，——他们用不着扮演，也不必研究文件材料，他们在这部电影里只是回忆过去的体验而已。
    中国人民的爱国妇女——母亲、妻子、姊妹们——和父亲、丈夫、兄弟们一齐备尝艰苦，她们在后方和前线把全部力量贡献给中国人民的事业。从女指导员冷云（她由乡村女教师成长为游击队领导者）的形象中，我们可以看出许多这样的中国妇女。在影片中，冷云和她的爱人周某——接受党交给他的任务而去做地下工作的游击队队长——分别的一幕，简单而又动人。冷云在这些进行游击战争的艰苦日子里，用自己英勇的坚定的意志去鼓舞部队的战士。她是这样英雄地忍受了关于周队长——她的爱人牺牲的消息。当游击队受到致命危险的威胁时，她和女战友们一起使敌人把攻击目标转向自己，以拯救部队的主力。她牺牲了，但她的死成为未来胜利的旗帜。
    扮演指导员冷云的演员岳慎，使苏联观众想起俄国人民女儿永垂不朽的功绩。
    观众喜爱女游击队员胡秀芝。她那因病而卧床不起的丈夫被侵略者烧死在贫穷的房子里，这并没有摧毁了一个纯朴农妇的精神力量。她把悲痛变为愤怒。伟大的愤恨使她参加了游击队。她在战斗中功绩卓著，终于参加了中国共产党。
    “我宣誓”她说，“绝对服从党的决定，为无产阶级事业奋斗到底，保守党的秘密，永不叛党。”
    在影片里，和中国爱国妇女们一起，出现了一个姓安的朝鲜少女的可爱形象。无论她在什么地方，姓安的少女总是认为反抗侵略者的战斗是她自己的神圣义务。
    “我们，朝鲜人，也不愿作奴隶，”姓安的女游击队员对中国女同志说，在表现中国人民为独立而斗争的光荣故事之一的影片在我国银幕上放映的日子里，我们知道姓安的朝鲜少女的为反抗美帝国主义而战斗着的兄弟姊妹们喊道：
    “打倒美国侵略者！”
    他们相信会战胜的，也像中国人民在争取自由的神圣战争中战胜了一样。我真幸福：我能够在中国大地上看到在中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东领导下的中国人民富有历史意义的胜利战斗。
    在解放斗争的炮火中诞生的年青的中国电影，已经有了来自人民而又全心全意效忠于人民的有才干的导演、演员、摄影师、和艺术家等干部，代替了那薰染了好莱坞腐化精神的国民党电影。新的、前进的人民电影艺术降临了。这就是为什么这部影片富有真正现实主义的、纯朴的鼓舞精神的缘故。
    这里一切都是很自然的、纯朴的，到处可以看到真理的伟大。虽然片中反映了中国人民在与日本侵略者战斗的严重岁月里所体验的许多艰难、困苦、贫穷，可是《中华女儿》这部影片，以乐观、信心、坚强意志等感觉，鼓舞人民走向胜利。在布拉格国际电影节影片竞赛会上，它获得了“争取自由斗争奖”。
    那些为了拯救和复兴民族而树立不朽功绩的中国儿女的光辉名字，将永远留在全世界爱好自由的各国人民的记忆里。
    “共产主义是不可抗御的！星星之火可以燎原！死难烈士万岁！”
    真实的爱国主义的影片《中华女儿》便是被毛泽东这些话赋以灵感的。
