　　Xinhua News Agency, September 17th: American imperialism is unilaterally and actively preparing for a peace treaty with Japan in order to let go of and arm Japan, using it as an accomplice in expanding its war of aggression in the Far East. According to a United States Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 14th, Truman announced at a press conference that he "has authorized the State Department to hold informal discussions with other member states of the Far Eastern Commission on the future procedures for a peace treaty with Japan." An Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the same day quoted American diplomatic sources as saying: "The State Department has just notified the thirteen countries of the Far Eastern Commission separately that the State Department hopes to begin discussions with them within the next two weeks on the procedural issues of a peace treaty with Japan."
    As is well known, according to the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration regarding the procedures for preparing a peace treaty with defeated nations, the peace treaty with Japan should be prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, and should adhere to the principle of great power unanimity. However, as early as 1947, the US government violated the Potsdam Declaration and unilaterally decided that the peace treaty with Japan should be prepared by the member states of the Far Eastern Commission. The purpose of this unreasonable behavior by the US government is to fundamentally destroy the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration regarding the demilitarization and democratization of Japan, to abolish the principle of great power unanimity, and to pave the way for the US plan to continue occupying and arming Japan in the form of a US-Japan alliance. A US Information Service dispatch from Washington on the 15th quoted "an official of the US government" as revealing this conspiracy of the US. The official said that the peace treaty that the United States hopes for is that "when the treaty comes into effect and the occupation ends, there will still be American troops stationed in Japan," and that "the United States will retain bases in Okinawa"; the United States does not want to place "any restrictions on the rearmament carried out when Japan is rearming" in the peace treaty; the United States hopes that "the Ryukyu Islands should become part of the United Nations trusteeship system and the United States should serve as the trustee country"; the United States hopes that the treaty "does not stipulate excessive reparations or compensation." From this, people can see that the US insistence on having the majority of member states of the Far Eastern Commission, which it manipulates, pass the peace treaty with Japan is merely an attempt to use this to legalize and perpetuate the US's separate occupation of Japan, thereby accelerating the work of arming Japan that has long been underway, making Japan an accomplice in its war of aggression in the Far East.
    This conspiracy plan of the US government not only attempts to disregard the right to speak and the legitimate interests of the Chinese and Soviet people, who played a decisive role in defeating Japanese imperialism, and to disregard the interests of the people of other countries that fought against Japan, but also to drag the Japanese people onto the path of destruction. Therefore, this conspiracy of the United States, like the reactionary proposition it put forward as early as July 11, 1947, that the peace treaty with Japan should be prepared by the member states of the Far Eastern Commission, and like the clamor for a separate peace treaty with Japan that it has issued since last September, will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the people of all countries in the world and the Japanese people.

### 阴谋放手武装日本扩大在远东的侵略  美帝积极准备对日片面媾和  忽视在击败日本中起决定作用的中苏人民的权益

　　阴谋放手武装日本扩大在远东的侵略
    美帝积极准备对日片面媾和
    忽视在击败日本中起决定作用的中苏人民的权益
    【新华社十七日讯】美帝国主义正在片面地积极准备对日媾和，以便放手武装日本，作为美国在远东扩大侵略战争的帮凶。据美国新闻处华盛顿十四日电，杜鲁门在招待记者会上宣布：他“已授权国务院与远东委员会的其他会员国家，就对日和约的未来程序问题，举行非正式的讨论”。合众社华盛顿同日电引美国外交人士透露：“国务院顷已分别通知远东委员十三国说：国务院希望在今后两周内与它们开始讨论对日和约的程序问题。”
    如所周知，按照波茨坦宣言关于准备对战败国家和约程序的规定，对日和约应由苏、中、美、英四国外长会议负责准备，并遵守大国一致的原则。但美国政府早在一九四七年即曾违反波茨坦宣言，片面地决定由远东委员会各会员国准备对日和约。美国政府这种无理行为，目的在于根本毁弃波茨坦宣言关于日本非军事化与民主化的规定，取消大国一致的原则，并为美国以美、日同盟的形式，继续占领与武装日本的计划，开辟道路。美国新闻处华盛顿十五日电引“美国政府的一位官员”的谈话，即道出了美国的这种阴谋。该官员说，美国所期望的对日和约是“在和约生效，占领告终时，在日本仍将驻有美国部队”，“美国将在冲绳保留基地”；美国不想在和约中对日本“要重新武装时所进行的重整军备加以任何限制”；美国希望“琉球群岛应成为联合国托管制的一部分而由美国充任托管国家”；美国希望和约“不规定过多的赔款或赔偿”。人们由此可以看出，美国坚持由其操纵的远东委员会多数会员国家通过对日和约，不过是图借此把美国在日本的单独占领合法化、永久化，从而加速早在进行的武装日本的工作，使日本成为其在远东扩大侵略战争的帮凶。
    美国政府这一阴谋计划，不仅企图忽视在击败日本帝国主义中起决定作用的中、苏两国人民的发言权和正当利益，忽视其他对日作战国家人民的利益，而且将把日本人民拖上毁灭的道路。因此，美国这一阴谋，如同它早在一九四七年七月十一日所提出的由远东委员会各会员国准备对日和约的反动主张一样，如同它在去年九月以后所发出的对日单独媾和的叫嚣一样，必将遭到世界各国人民与日本人民的坚决反对。
