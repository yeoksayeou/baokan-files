　　"No high mountains, no visible plains!"
    Datong miners admire Ma Liuhai
    Chaha'er Provincial Federation of Trade Unions
    Ma Liuhai is a tunneling worker at the Baitong Mine of the Datong Mining Bureau. Together with his close partner Lian Wanlu, he has created a series of new records in manual tunneling, leading workers throughout the mine to break quotas, improve production efficiency, and reduce costs, creating a large amount of wealth for the country.
    In early April of this year, the mine implemented quota management. Most workers lacked confidence and discussed, "The highest efficiency during the enemy's time was only 45 centimeters. Today, we want to reach 50 centimeters, it's impossible!" "This place won't work, we'll have to go somewhere else!" Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu carefully considered their two or thirty years of experience in coal mines and believed that reaching a quota of 50 centimeters was no problem, and they could even exceed it. At the mobilization meeting to implement the new quota, Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu proposed a guarantee to tunnel 70 centimeters, challenging other groups to compete. However, only a few people accepted the challenge, and the administrative leaders also lacked confidence. Most of the workers ridiculed, "I think they don't want to live anymore!" "Want to tunnel 70 centimeters, what a load of bull! If we're talking nonsense, I can tunnel 100 centimeters!" These ridicules did not shake the will and confidence of Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu, on the contrary, they secretly added fuel and were determined to make an example.
    Ma and Lian organized their tools, brought extra picks, and allocated the time for undercutting, slotting, blasting, and scraping the sides and roof. The two worked hard all day and indeed reached 70 centimeters. The next day, it increased to 75 centimeters, and the third day reached 80 centimeters. This further encouraged their confidence in improving production. They continued to study diligently, improve their skills, and rationally divide the work. As a result, the tunneling efficiency gradually increased to a record of 1.36 meters, exceeding the quota at the time by 172 percent. In June, they created a new record of 2.08 meters.
    The news of Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu's continuous new records immediately spread throughout the mine. But at first, people didn't believe it, saying unconvinced, "It must be that the tunnel is soft, and if I go, I can achieve the same!" Individual cadres also echoed, "It's just that the tunnel is soft. Once I hit it with a stick, several bowl-sized pieces of coal fell down." Some backward workers said, "Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu have ruined the market. Now it's impossible to complete the task by tunneling only 20 or 30 centimeters." "You don't want to live, and you want to drag others to their deaths!" Some people even intentionally tried to sabotage. Once, when Ma and Lian were working hard, someone shouted from above, "It's time to get off work!" When they came out, there were still two hours left. Despite this, the two of them continued to work hard, and production continued to rise. The production activists were also unconvinced. Ding Fuliang, Li He, and others repeatedly requested to exchange tunnels with them. The leaders agreed. The result of the trial was that Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu advanced 90 centimeters, while Ding Fuliang and Li He only advanced 35 centimeters. Ma and Lian did not mock them, but adopted a positive attitude to help them, explaining the nature of the coal, where the explosives should be placed, and personally loading the explosives. As a result, Ding Fuliang and Li He achieved a tunneling rate of 70 centimeters that day.
    In July, Baitong Mine switched to using nitrate for blasting. Everyone couldn't figure out the properties of the medicine for a while, and it wouldn't explode. One shift fired four shots in a row without ignition, and another shift only fired one shot out of three. Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu went to help Ma Baoshan's shift study down the well. As a result, three shots blasted 70 centimeters. "They are really capable!" "It's true that without high mountains, there are no visible plains!" Some unconvinced people spoke their minds.
    Wherever the work was difficult, Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu requested to go there. No. 4 tunnel was the hardest, and no one wanted to work there. After the entire well broke the quota, the standard for No. 4 tunnel was also raised from 30 centimeters to 50 centimeters. As a result, no one wanted to go there, so it was shut down for more than 50 days. The administration assigned Ma and Lian to work in the tunnel. They gladly accepted the task and raised the standard to 60 centimeters. As a result, the monthly average still exceeded the quota by 50 percent. Under the influence of Ma Liuhai and Lian Wanlu, many advanced producers emerged in the Datong mines, greatly promoting the production efficiency of the entire mine.

### “不见高山，不显平地！”  大同矿工人人佩服马六孩

　　“不见高山，不显平地！”
    大同矿工人人佩服马六孩
    察哈尔省总工会
    马六孩是大同矿务局白洞矿的掘进工人，他和他的亲密伙伴连万禄共同创造了一连串的人工掘进新纪录，并带动了全矿工人纷纷突破定额，提高了生产效率，降低了成本，为国家创造了大量财富。
    本年四月初，矿上实行定额管理，大多数工人都没有信心，纷纷议论说：“敌人在的时候最高效率才刨四十五公分，今天想达到五十公分，办不到！”“这地方吃不开，还会到别的地方去！”马六孩和连万禄仔细一琢磨，凭二、三十年的在煤矿上的经验，认为达到五十公分定额没有问题，而且还能超过。在贯彻新定额动员大会上，马六孩和连万禄就提出保证掘进七十公分，向其他组挑战竞赛，可是只有少数人应了战，行政领导上也缺乏信心，大部分工友却讽刺说：“我看他们是不想活了！”“想刨七十公分，真他妈的吹牛！说空话我还能刨一百公分呢！”这些奚落并没有动摇马六孩和连万禄的意志与信心，反倒更暗中加油，决心要干一个样子出来。
    马、连两人整理好工具，多带镐头，把刨根拉槽、放炮、擦帮搜顶的时间都分配好，两个人加劲干了一天，果然达到了七十公分，第二天又增到七十五公分，第三天达八十公分。这更加有力的鼓舞了他们提高生产的信心，他们继续苦心钻研，改进技术，合理分工，于是掘进效率逐渐升达一米三十六公分的纪录，超过当时定额百分之一百七十二；六月份又创造了二米零八公分的新纪录。
    马六孩和连万禄连创新纪录的消息，立刻传遍了全矿。但开始人们还不信，不服气的说：“一定是洞子软，叫我去同样能达到！”个别干部也随声附和：“就是洞子软，有一次我拿棒子一通，就通下碗大的几块炭。”部分落后工人说：“马六孩、连万禄给坏了行情，现在刨二、三十公分已交不了账，”“你们不要命，还想把别人拉死！”有人甚至有意进行捣乱，有一次，马、连干活正起劲的时候，洞上有人叫喊：“下班时间到了！”出来一看还差两个钟头。虽然如此，他二人仍埋头苦干，生产一直上升。生产积极的也不服气，丁福亮、李和等三番五次要求和他们换洞子，领导上答应了，试行结果马六孩和连万禄前进九十公分，丁福亮、李和只前进三十五公分。马、连二人对他们没有嘲笑，而采取了积极帮助的态度，说明炭的性质，炮应按在那里放，并亲自给装炮、结果丁福亮、李和当天就达到了七十公分的掘进率。
    七月份白洞井改用硝?装炮，大家一时摸不着药性，放不响，有一班连放四炮没过火，另一班三炮才响一炮。马六孩和连万禄就去帮助马保山班下井研究，结果三炮打下七十公分。“人家就是行！”“真是不见高山，不显平地！”一些不服气的人们都说了心里话。
    那里工作困难，马六孩和连万禄就要求到那里去。四号洞子是最硬的一个，谁也不愿到那里干活。全井突破定额后，四号洞的标准也由三十公分提高到五十公分，这一来更没人愿意去了，因此曾停工五十多天。行政上又分配马、连两人去该洞工作，他俩愉快地接受了任务，并且把标准提高到六十公分，结果，全月平均仍超额百分之五十。在马六孩和连万禄的影响下，大同各矿涌现了不少先进生产者，大大推进了全矿的生产效率。
