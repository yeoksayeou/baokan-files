Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: The Worker's Daily published an editorial today titled "Strengthen Trade Union Women Workers' Work," stating: The experience of women workers' work over the past year proves that women workers' work is an indispensable and unignorable important part of the entire trade union work. Especially in industrial sectors such as the textile industry, women workers' work is particularly important. The editorial pointed out that one of the important reasons why women workers' work has not kept up with the requirements of the objective situation in the past is that general trade union organizations have not paid enough attention to women workers' work in the past, and rarely or never specifically discussed women workers' work issues; not only was the specific leadership and assistance to the women workers' department very poor, but cadres of the women workers' department were also frequently transferred, and some individual trade union organizations even cancelled the women workers' department; other work departments in the trade union organization also rarely cared about and considered the relationship between women workers and the work of their departments.

The editorial pointed out: Women workers' work is by no means only the task of the women workers' department; however, it is also wrong to think that because women workers' work is a part of the entire trade union work, the women workers' department can be cancelled. The only reason to specifically establish a women workers' department in trade union organizations with women workers is to prevent the special needs of the broad masses of women workers from being ignored in the general work of the trade union.

The editorial said: Over the past year, the work of women workers' departments at all levels has often been in a state of flux between two deviations: either only paying attention to combining with general work, the women workers' department has no central business of its own, "cooperating" everywhere, passively coping, losing the due role of the women workers' department, and some have virtually cancelled the work of the women workers' department; or emphasizing the special problems of women workers, forgetting to combine with general work, and thus being "isolated and helpless," with many difficulties. The editorial pointed out: In the future, the specific tasks of the women workers' department are, on the one hand, to check whether the various documents issued by the trade union organization and the work of various departments have paid attention to women workers' issues; to put forward suggestions and criticisms to closely integrate women workers' work with general trade union work, and develop simultaneously. On the other hand, the women workers' department must grasp the specific problems that women workers urgently demand to be solved and can be solved, such as nurseries, maternal and child health issues, etc. The editorial emphasized: Comrades doing women workers' work must pay attention to "ordinary trivial matters" of this kind that are most specific and of most concern to the masses. Only by truly and effectively doing a few specific tasks that are most closely related to the masses of women workers can the women workers' department most practically give the women workers a helping hand, reduce and eliminate the burden and constraints of women workers in production and life; and only in this way can the masses of women workers be closely connected, problems can be discovered from the masses of women workers, and practical and feasible solutions can be proposed to promote the entire trade union organization to do a good job in women workers' work. In addition, the work of employees' families is also one of the important tasks of the women workers' department. An average worker has two family members, and when calculated together with the worker themselves, they often account for more than half of the urban population. Therefore, organizing the families of workers and uniting them around the trade union organization plays a significant role in ensuring the completion of production tasks; and it has extremely important political significance for supporting and consolidating the construction of the people's regime.

The editorial called on trade union organizations in various places to conscientiously review the past situation of leadership in women workers' work in accordance with the spirit of this National Women Workers' Work Conference, and in combination with the current central tasks of the local area, formulate a plan for future women workers' work, focusing on key points and strengthening women workers' work step by step, in order to mobilize the strength of the entire working class and strive for a fundamental improvement in the country's financial and economic situation.

### 加强工会女工工作  工人日报社论摘要

　　加强工会女工工作
    工人日报社论摘要
    【新华社二日讯】此间工人日报今日发表“加强工会女工工作”社论称：一年来女工工作的经验证明：女工工作是整个工会工作中不可缺少、不可忽视的一个重要部分。特别是在纺织业等产业部门中，女工工作尤其重要。社论指出过去女工工作还赶不上客观形势要求的重要原因之一是：过去一般的工会组织对于女工工作不够重视，很少或没有专门讨论过女工工作问题；不仅对于女工部的具体领导和帮助很差，而且还经常抽调女工部的干部，有个别的工会组织甚至取消了女工部；工会组织中的其他工作部门，也很少关心与考虑到女工与自己部门工作的关系。
    社论指出：女工工作决不仅是女工部的任务；但是认为女工工作既是整个工会工作的一部分，就可以取消女工部，这种思想也是错误的。在有女工群众的工会组织中要专门设立女工部的唯一的理由，就是为了防止在工会的一般工作中，忽视广大女工群众的特殊要求。
    社论说：一年来，各级女工部的工作，经常处在两种偏向的动荡之中：或者只注意了与一般工作相结合，女工部没有自己的中心业务，处处“配合”，被动应付，失去了女工部应有的作用，有的在实际上等于取消了女工部的工作；或者强调女工的特殊问题，而忘掉了与一般工作相结合，因而“孤立无援”，困难很多。社论指出：今后女工部的具体任务，一方面是要检查工会组织所发布的各种文件及各部门工作是否注意了女工问题；提出建议与批评使女工工作与一般工会工作紧密结合，同时发展。另一方面，女工部必须抓住女工群众中迫切要求解决而又可能解决的具体问题，如托儿所、妇婴卫生问题等。社论强调指出：做女工工作的同志必须重视托儿所、妇婴卫生等这样一类最具体和群众最关心的“平凡小事”。女工部只有真正切实做好几件与女工群众关系最密切的具体工作，才是最实际地给女工加了一把力，减少和消除女工在生产上与生活上的负担与束缚；也只有如此才能够密切地联系女工群众，从女工群众中发现问题和提出切实可行的解决办法，推动整个工会组织把女工工作做好。此外，职工家属工作，也是女工部的重要任务之一。一个工人平均有两个家属，连工人本身一起计算起来，往往占到城市人口的一半以上。所以把工人家属组织起来，使之团结在工会组织的周围，这对保证完成生产任务，是有重大作用的；对于支持与巩固人民政权的建设上，更有极其重大的政治意义。
    社论要求各地工会组织根据这次全国女工工作会议的精神，切实检讨一下过去对于女工工作领导的情况，并且结合当地目前的中心任务，订出今后女工工作的计划，有重点、有步骤地把女工工作加强起来，以便动员整个工人阶级的力量，为争取国家财政经济状况的根本好转而奋斗。
