(From Our Correspondent) The Jinzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Liaoxi Province inspected the city-wide rectification movement in late August. Some units have grasped the key problems in their current work, conducted inspections and summaries, and work has begun to improve. However, other units still have many problems that hinder the inspection and summarization of work. The more important problems are the following incorrect phenomena existing in the development of democracy and the use of criticism and self-criticism: One is that some leading cadres in some units cannot take the lead in self-examination, so that ordinary cadres are worried when making criticisms. They raise problems that are distant rather than near, secondary rather than major, and about leaders who have left office rather than responsible cadres in office. In short, they "watch the situation" and fear "getting burned." Another is that some leading cadres leave the meeting to let everyone express their opinions, relying only on reports and records from others to consider problems. Secondly, some units, although they have identified the main problems, cannot analyze and study them, but instead summarily label them with several "ism" tags. Some units are satisfied with the initial results of the inspection. As soon as problems are identified, they are eager to formulate systems and draft clauses, and relax the continued inspection, analysis, and research. There are even individual units that are still conducting personal self-examinations instead of examining their work.

In order to overcome the above biases, the Jinzhou Municipal Party Committee instructed all units to pay attention to the following issues: (1) Responsible cadres of each unit must first put forward the key problems in their work, mobilize everyone to discuss them, and summarize these opinions. Then, conduct inspections and summaries by department. (2) Correctly develop democracy and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Necessary criticism should be given to individual responsible cadres who are proud, complacent, and unwilling to listen to opinions from below, or who adopt an evasive attitude towards rectification. On the other hand, leading cadres who do not examine themselves and attribute all mistakes to the main responsible cadres should be promptly educated and corrected. In the inspection, opinions raised by everyone should be humbly considered and summarized. Opinions related to the focus of rectification should also be examined in front of the masses to guide everyone to raise opinions on key aspects. Necessary explanations and clarifications can be made for some opinions that do not conform to the facts. (3) Adopt a method of combining internal and external forces, convene cadres from relevant departments, people's representatives, and some non-Party masses to hold seminars, or go deep into the masses to collect opinions and criticisms on work. Government departments have achieved successful experience in this regard. However, self-examination and summarization from top to bottom should not be ignored or relaxed. (4) In the inspection work, we must also study and determine methods for improvement in order to achieve the goal of rectifying and reforming at the same time. However, attention must also be paid to correcting the bias of rushing to formulate improvement measures or waiting for higher authorities to come up with solutions before problems have been identified, analyzed, and researched to find the causes.

　　锦州市某些单位整风中
    运用自我批评有偏向
    市委已指出具体改进办法
    【本报讯】辽西中共锦州市委会，在八月下旬检查了全市整风运动，其中有若干单位已抓住当前工作中的关键性的问题，进行检查与总结，工作也开始有了改进。但是另有一些单位，仍存在很多问题，障碍了工作的检查与总结。其中较重要的是在发扬民主与运用批评与自我批评方面，存在以下两种不正确现象：一种是由于有些单位的领导干部不能带头检讨，因此使一般干部在进行批评时有所顾虑，提问题提远的不提近的，提次要的不提主要的，提已离职的领导干部不提在职的负责干部，总之“看火候”怕“惹火烧身”。另一种是有些领导干部为了使大家提意见，开会时退出会场，仅凭别人的汇报及记录来考虑问题。其次是有的单位，虽然把主要问题检查出来了，但不能分析研究，而是笼统的扣上几个“主义”的大帽子。有的单位满足于初步检查的成绩，问题刚检查出来，就急于订制度、拟条文，放松了继续检查分析研究。甚至还有个别单位，还在作个人检查而不检查工作。
    锦州市委为了克服以上偏向，指示各单位应注意以下几个问题：（一）各单位负责干部，必须首先提出工作中的关键性的问题，发动大家讨论，并归纳这些意见。然后按部门进行检查与总结。（二）正确地发扬民主，开展批评与自我批评。对个别骄傲自满、不虚心听取下面意见，或对整风采取应付态度的负责干部，应进行必要的批评。另一方面，对于一些不检讨自己、把一切错误归诸于主要负责干部的领导干部，应迅速教育纠正。在检查中，对大家所提的意见，应虚心考虑与归纳。对与整风重点有关的意见，还应在群众面前进行检讨，以引导大家向重点方面提意见。对于一些与事实不符的意见，可以进行必要的解释与说明。（三）采取内外结合的方法，召集有关部门干部，人民代表及一些非党群众开座谈会，或深入群众搜集对工作的意见与批评。政府部门已在这方面取得成功的经验。但不能忽视与放松了自上而下的检查与总结。（四）在检查工作中，同时要研究与定出改进的办法，以达到边整边改的目的。但是对于问题尚未集中，也未分析研究，找出原因，就急于定出改进办法或等待上级给想办法的偏向，亦须注意纠正。
