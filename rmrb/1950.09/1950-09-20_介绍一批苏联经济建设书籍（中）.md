　　Introducing a Batch of Soviet Economic Construction Books (Part Two)
    Liu Jichen
    III. On Strengthening and Implementing Economic Accounting System
    The books introduced last time focused on the overall national economic plan of the Soviet Union. Now, let me introduce some books on the internal planning of Soviet enterprises.
    The foundation of the Soviet Union's overall national economic plan is built on the internal plans of enterprises, and the key to enterprise internal planning lies in the implementation of the economic accounting system. The so-called economic accounting system is the principle guiding every socialist enterprise: "Its purpose is to systematically improve the economic effect of every ruble spent and every ton of raw materials and fuel, and to increase labor productivity and reduce production costs"; "Its task is to ensure the most rational and economical organization of production." The implementation of the Soviet economic accounting system ensures the accurate progress and early completion of the Soviet economic plan, accumulating huge wealth for Soviet socialist society. Our state-owned enterprises in Northeast China, by learning from the Soviet Union and implementing the economic accounting system, have already achieved significant results in reducing costs, increasing profits, and improving product quality. In the future, all our public and private enterprises should immediately learn from Northeast China, implement the economic accounting system, accumulate funds, and expand reproduction, in order to accelerate the recovery and development of our national economy.
    I would like to introduce the following books on the economic accounting system:
    《The Economic Accounting System in Socialist Society》 (Volumes 1 and 2)
          Translated and printed by the Survey and Statistics Department of the Northeast Financial and Economic Committee
    《How to Implement the Economic Accounting System》 Compiled and printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    《Strengthening the Economic Accounting System and Overcoming Waste in Industrial Production》
          Compiled and printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    《Quota Management》 Compiled and printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    The above four books (excluding Volume 2 of "The Economic Accounting System in Socialist Society," which will be discussed later), the first two focus on the theoretical analysis and elucidation of the economic accounting system, and the latter two focus on general application explanations and introductions. They can all be considered good books for learning the economic accounting system at present.
    《The Economic Accounting System in Socialist Society》 Volume 1 was originally published by the Soviet Political Literature Publishing House in 1944. It systematically explains a series of issues concerning the economic accounting system from a theoretical perspective and is a good book for understanding the essence of the economic accounting system. The book first explains the economic accounting system through planned economy and the law of value, pointing out that "the law of value in socialist society exists in a new form... In socialist society, it is not a law of blind movement, but a tool consciously used by society for socialist planned economy," "The role of the law of value in socialist society does not cause waste of materials and labor, nor does it cause the meaningless disappearance of social wealth and social productive forces; on the contrary, the struggle to rationally and systematically utilize the law of value will surely guarantee the greatest savings of materials and labor, and guarantee the growth of social resources and the welfare of the entire people of socialist society." In order for society to systematically utilize the law of value, it is necessary for enterprises to implement the economic accounting system; therefore, "the economic accounting system is the most rational organizational form of enterprise activities, the most capable of adapting enterprise activities to the tasks of the law of value." From this, it can be seen that the economic accounting system is inseparable from the planned economy. The book also clearly points out that "the economic accounting system can only complete its tasks when it obeys the plan, serves the plan, and struggles to complete the plan." To obey and complete the plan, it is also necessary to take into account the overall interests of socialist society; otherwise, using extra-plan methods to increase profits would be an act of violating the state and hindering the overall economic development. "Therefore, the leadership of the economic accounting system must be Bolshevik, and in promoting the principles of the economic accounting system, the overall interests of socialist society must be taken into account, because only by fighting for these interests can the victory of communism be achieved." Secondly, it explains the relationship between money and the economic accounting system; the Soviet economic accounting system can only be realized through monetary calculations, such as formulating plans, calculating costs, judging the socially necessary labor consumption, and various systems included in the economic accounting system that have a stimulating effect, all of which must be done through monetary calculations. Therefore, "in managing socialist enterprises, in order to realize statistics and supervision and implement the economic accounting system, money is indispensable; because in the development stage of socialism, there is no other tool that can statistically measure the entire economy." In addition, it systematically analyzes and elaborates on the organization of enterprise funds in the economic accounting system, the commodity costs of state-owned socialist enterprises, cost value and prices, economic contracts and commercial economic accounting systems, the balance of payments of enterprises, and the state's use of currency circulation to supervise the progress of plan execution. 《The Economic Accounting System in Socialist Society》 Volume 2 is a collection of four translated articles. The content is largely repetitive with 《How to Implement the Economic Accounting System》 and 《Strengthening the Economic Accounting System and Overcoming Waste in Industrial Production》. The latter two books can include the former, but the former cannot include the latter two, so they will not be introduced here.
    《How to Implement the Economic Accounting System》 is a relatively large book with 360 pages, covering many aspects. It is a comprehensive book on the economic accounting system. It not only discusses the economic accounting system itself but also includes issues of business leadership and various methods for implementing the economic accounting system. The content is novel and rich, and it is worth reading. In particular, the two articles by A. Briegali, "The Essence of the Soviet Economic Accounting System," and Kovalev's "Individual Economic Accounting System is an Important Method for Increasing Profits," are essential reading for us. The first article first describes the development of the Soviet economic accounting system, explaining that the content or implementation methods of the economic accounting system have undergone fundamental changes in various stages of socialist construction. Initially, the Soviet government "knew that heavy industry was significant for reforming the entire national economy and increasing the country's economic and defense power, and provided necessary financial assistance to enterprises that could not generate profits for the time being, especially heavy industry." Later, with the development of socialist economy and technology, "in order to make all heavy industry profitable sectors of the national economy, the Soviet government completely abolished the subsidy system for enterprises in 1936 and implemented various measures related to consolidating the economic accounting system." As a result, "the total profits obtained by various industrial people's committees from 1935 to 1939 increased from 4.1 billion to 9.9 billion, an increase of more than two times." This change in the content and methods of the Soviet economic accounting system increased the country's wealth by such a large amount, entirely relying on the Soviet government's ability to skillfully grasp the laws of economic development and appropriately adopt correct policies. In the economic construction path of our New Democratic society, this experience of the Soviet Union is invaluable. The second point discussed is the characteristics of the Soviet economic accounting system, first making an essential analysis of the difference between the socialist economic accounting system and the capitalist "principle of economic efficiency": "The so-called 'principle of economic efficiency' is to endlessly pursue profits in everything," while "the socialist economic accounting system is exactly the opposite of this capitalist 'principle of economic efficiency,' because its foundation is not individual interests but the interests of the entire society." Then, it puts forward the basic characteristics of the socialist economic accounting system: "The fundamental feature of economic accounting is to arouse enterprises' material concern for their business performance in order to stimulate their activities and enable them to complete and exceed the plan." "The Soviet Union's financial policy towards enterprises is to strengthen the management of enterprises with the economic accounting system, abolish the previous practice of using government funds to increase the fixed and working capital of enterprises, and adopt the method of relying as much as possible on enterprises' own accumulation to increase their fixed and working capital." These two experiences of the Soviet Union are also very valuable for our enterprise management and operation. All enterprise managers and others engaged in enterprise management must keep the above two points in mind at all times and try to make them a reality.
    Secondly, Kovalev's article "Individual Economic Accounting System is an Important Method for Increasing Profits" mainly introduces the experience and achievements of the Soviet individual economic accounting system. Previously, the implementation of the economic accounting system in Soviet enterprises "was considered to be only possible at the workshop level, and at most at the shift level... The savings index of individual workers was not calculated." However, since the recent implementation of the individual economic accounting system, the quality of products has greatly improved. The experience of the Bilenzhnikovsky Soda Factory tells us that "the individual economic accounting system can create extra-plan accumulation, better utilize working capital, improve production technical knowledge, and transform the quality of products." This is the latest valuable experience of the Soviet Union, which is worth learning.
    "Strengthening the Economic Accounting System and Overcoming Waste in Industrial Production" mainly talks about general technical issues in the economic accounting system. It explains the classification of production costs, the composition of costs, the methods of calculating costs, the methods of reducing production costs, and the methods of improving quality. In Cherkov's article "Classification of Production Costs and Components of Costs," the first thing put forward is a typical item of expense classification (there are many items, which are not convenient to list), and at the same time, the significance of the classification is explained: "In order to know the production cost of finished products and semi-finished products, all expenses must be estimated according to the items listed above," "The correct establishment of production cost accounting is determined by the expense classification..." Chernov's article "How to Reduce the Cost of Production" provides a concise analysis and explanation of the basic factors affecting the changes in production costs, such as the impact of labor productivity material consumption, administrative management and sales expenses, etc., on the changes in production costs. In addition, Cao Lu's two articles, "On Standard Cost Accounting" and "Management Issues of Standard Specifications," are also good materials worth reading. The former discusses the issues of setting raw material standard costs, labor standard costs, standard manufacturing expenses, and standard manufacturing labor costs, etc.; the latter discusses the issue of purchasing raw materials for factories after the war and the standard specification management of producing finished products with purchased goods.
    《Quota Management》 is about quota issues. It tells us that "the so-called quota is to determine the standard quality of a certain product according to a certain technical level and technical equipment, determine the standard number of raw materials, materials, and personnel used to produce the product, determine the standard production time for producing a certain product, determine the standard quantity of products produced by using a certain machine in a certain period of time, determine the standard quantity of various expenses, determine the depreciation of machines, etc." The book contains Stalin's article "New Talents and New Technical Norms," which criticizes the shortcomings of technical norms formulated based on technical backwardness, criticizes the erroneous view of talking about scientific principles without practical experience, and criticizes the erroneous view of not needing any technical norms. At the same time, it correctly indicates a standard for setting quotas: "The technical norms we need now should be a norm between the current technical norms and the standards reached by Stakhanov and Bussegen and others." This average advanced quota is closely related to mobilizing the potential forces within the enterprise. The second article, Ivanov's "On Average Advanced Quotas and Industrial Potential," explains this issue. In addition to explaining the various issues that should be considered when setting quotas in order to mobilize enterprise potential, it also introduces the different effects of various production factors caused by different economic sectors and the classification of technical norms stipulated by the Soviet state plan. In addition, the book also contains several articles introducing the experience of implementing quota management in Northeast China's industry, which is also very valuable.
    The above are general books on the economic accounting system; in addition, there are several small pamphlets that belong to the technical application aspect, deal with individual problems, and are more practical, which are also very good. They are introduced on the left:
    《Technical and Industrial Financial Plan of Industrial Enterprises》 written by Chepurov, translated by Jin Zhijun
          Printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    《Ways to Reduce Costs》 written by Kamarov, translated by Su Mingxi
          Printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    《Production Costs and Cost Reduction Methods in Soviet Mechanical Manufacturing》 written by Bulmestrlov
          Printed by the Xinhua Bookstore
    《Calculation of Fixed Assets of Industrial Enterprises》 written by Tatur and Krasnov, translated by Ma Bin
          Published by the Dalian Economic Research Association
    《How Soviet Industrial Enterprises Use Working Capital》 written by A. E. M. Birman
          Translated by the Economic Department of the Northeast Industrial Department
    《Expense Plan for Recurring Expenses in Trade Departments》 written by Ivannikova and Milashevic, translated by Yang Zuoren
          Published by the Era Publishing House
    《Technical and Industrial Financial Plan of Industrial Enterprises》 is a record of a public lecture given by the author at the Moscow Soviet National Association for the Popularization of Political and Scientific Knowledge in 1948. It first points out the shortcomings of the old industrial financial plan and how to formulate a new and correct technical and industrial financial plan. Secondly, it explains what the task of the technical and industrial financial plan is, how many parts its content includes, how to compile the technical and industrial financial plan, how to do it for the whole year, how to do it for the quarter, how many steps there are in the preparation stage, how to do each step, and how to do the completion stage. Finally, it explains how to account for and supervise the implementation, and according to which documents to implement it. The book is concise and clear, and it is an excellent reader for those engaged in enterprise management.
    《Ways to Reduce Costs》 briefly and vividly depicts the work experience of the Moscow "Sickle and Hammer" Metallurgical Factory, which won the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor. It provides a vivid introduction to how the factory strived for high labor productivity, reduced production costs, and implemented the economic accounting system, as well as the achievements it has made. (There is also a translation of this kind by the Writer's House, called 《Experience of Soviet Factories in Reducing Costs》).
    《Production Costs and Cost Reduction Methods in Soviet Mechanical Manufacturing》 is written by the author Bulmestrlov based on the materials he collected during his 25 years of continuous work in the planning department of the mechanical manufacturing industry and the results of his discussions with workers in the planning departments of various factories and workshops. It provides a concise explanation of production costs, product unit cost calculation, cost reduction plans, and cost fees and cost reduction methods, etc., and includes charts for reference. Although the content of this book focuses on the mechanical manufacturing industry, many materials can also be used in general enterprises.
    《Calculation of Fixed Assets of Industrial Enterprises》 provides a scientific, concrete, and systematic introduction to the Soviet industrial enterprises' experience in accounting treatment, classification, and valuation of fixed assets. Here, a clear concept is given for working capital and fixed assets, and it is pointed out how to classify them and how to conduct depreciation. The book contains examples and charts, which are clear, concrete, and practical.
    《How Soviet Industrial Enterprises Use Working Capital》 is a pamphlet, which is a lecture given by Birman, the economic editor of the Soviet Pravda newspaper, in the Moscow Central Lecture Hall. It provides a detailed analysis of the specific organization of working capital in industrial enterprises, various methods for accelerating the turnover rate of working capital in industrial enterprises, and the significant effect of accelerating the turnover rate of working capital on the development of the national economy. Moreover, we can also see from this book that the use of working capital in Soviet enterprises is far superior to that in capitalist countries: "If an American capitalist enterprise has one dollar of fixed assets, it must have one and a half dollars of working capital, which is an unavoidable transaction; but at the same time, in Soviet industry, if there is one ruble of fixed assets, there only needs to be 70 kopecks of working capital, which is less than fixed assets. By using socialist economic wealth, many enterprises have achieved very great achievements in the use of working capital..." Under the Soviet planned economic system, it overcomes the various unreasonable uses of enterprises in capitalist countries and enables working capital to grow year by year, reaching a huge amount: "The increase in working capital in 1948 alone reached 10.7 billion rubles, and in 1949, with the increase in national economic power, the new funds invested in working capital reached 23.6 billion rubles."
    《Expense Plan for Recurring Expenses in Trade Departments》 is a rare good book on the accounting of expenses in trade departments. It first gives a clear concept of recurring expenses in trade departments; then, it briefly explains the conditions for reducing recurring expenses, the importance of recurring expenses in evaluating performance, the important principles for compiling the recurring expense plan, the impact of commodity circulation and commodity categories on the level of recurring expenses, and the impact of labor productivity on the level of wage expenses; secondly, it provides a more detailed explanation of the importance of analyzing recurring expenses and the main methods of analysis; finally, it analyzes the names of recurring expense items in more detail, dividing them into 18 items, and explains their significance and calculation methods in trade departments separately. This book is a must-read for those engaged in trade department work.
    The economic accounting system can never be implemented well only by relying on statistics and accounting figures. It is more necessary to follow the mass line. Such as launching labor competitions, establishing factory committees, thoroughly implementing democratic management, implementing rationalization proposals, and implementing the responsibility system, etc., are all important methods to strengthen and implement the economic accounting system. Regarding such books, I have read the following:
    《Production Competition》 Compiled and printed by the Xinhua Bookstore
    《Democratization of Enterprise Management》 Compiled and printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    《Rationalization Proposals》 Compiled and printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    《Production Responsibility System》 Compiled and printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    《Collective Contracts in the Soviet Union》 written by Bashershtnikov, translated by Liqun
              Printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore
    Lenin saw early on that competition was the main force in socialist construction. The day after the workers and peasants seized power, he stipulated that organizing competition was one of the important tasks of the moment. The first article in the above book 《Production Competition》 is what Lenin published at that time to call for the organization of competition. Lenin exposed the deception of bourgeois writers who extremely praised the competition and private enterprise of the capitalist system, and pointed out that socialist society was the first time in history to create the possibility of truly large-scale application of competition. At the same time, he called on the broad masses of people to wage a decisive struggle against the evils and dross left over from capitalist society, such as stubborn conservatism, servility, selfishness, carelessness, haste, cowardice, and other corrupt habits. He finally instructed everyone: "Only by combining theory and practice can we eliminate those conservative ideas and establish a new attitude towards labor." The other articles in this book are about the Stakhanov movement, describing how glorious, noble, brave, and heroic labor is in the Soviet Union. How great and infinite is the initiative and creativity that labor has unleashed in the Soviet Union. In short, the implementation of the Soviet enterprise economic accounting system and the over-completion of the planned economy mainly rely on socialist competition.
    The book 《Democratization of Enterprise Management》, one part of which points out how to follow the mass line in order to do a good job in production, and the other part separately explains the organizational form and specific organizational methods of enterprise management. The third part introduces the production meetings of Soviet enterprise departments, pointing out that the production meetings within Soviet enterprises are emotional institutions closely related to workers and enterprises, and they have become the greatest driving force of Soviet industry. They have become a field for deciding important issues in factories, striving to mobilize and apply all possibilities for over-completing production tasks, and extensively carrying out self-criticism, overcoming shortcomings, and promoting creative initiative.
    The book 《Rationalization Proposals》 introduces the experience and achievements of the Soviet Union in implementing rationalization proposals. Rationalization proposals are one of the important methods for the Soviet Union to manage factories and implement the economic accounting system. Needless to say, it is also one of the best methods for relying on the working class to run factories well and strengthen the mass line of the economic accounting system. It is a vivid embodiment of the democratic management of factories. Without it, Soviet industry would not have such a brilliant and active development as it has today. In the first half of 1949, more than 55,000 rationalization proposals were put forward in the iron and steel industry alone, which increased labor efficiency by 16% and reduced production costs by 7%.
    The book 《Production Responsibility System》 describes the achievements of the Northeast Railway and some factories in learning from Soviet experience and implementing the responsibility system and the one-chief system in the Soviet Union. The first article in this book is Stalin's 《Organization of Labor》 (speech at the conference of economic workers in 1931). Here, the misinterpretation of the continuous production system and the phenomenon of no one being responsible are criticized, and it is correctly pointed out that "the task now is to eliminate the phenomenon of no one being responsible, improve labor organization, and correctly deploy labor in enterprises." The next few articles introduce the experience and achievements of the Northeast Crew Responsibility System, the Production Responsibility System of the Andong Public Factory, the Three-Shift Special Responsibility System implemented by the Benxi Foundry, and the Special Responsibility System of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory. In these articles, the characteristics and advantages of the responsibility system, the reasons for the existence and the environment in which the phenomenon of no one being responsible exists, certain misinterpretations of the responsibility system, and how the responsibility system should be promoted, etc., are explained and introduced in detail.
    Finally, the author of the book 《Collective Contracts in the Soviet Union》 is a Soviet Doctor of Law. He clarifies the political, legal, and moral significance of Soviet collective contract politics based on Soviet labor law and other relevant regulations. This is a feature of this book. When he clarifies the significance of collective contracts based on legal provisions, he says: "The collective contract in the Soviet Union is a two-party political and economic document. It not only includes legal provisions, but also includes the provisions of socialist morality, and the moral significance is very great. But this is not a purposeless and irresponsible invocation of 'justice' or 'good morality,' as is often contained in contracts stipulated by bourgeois laws. In fact, their clauses are only intended to prove that the exploitation of the exploiting class is correct." He also said: "The combination of political, moral, and legal factors in the collective contract is an important feature, showing the difference between Soviet collective contracts and collective contracts in capitalist countries. The socialist nature of the Soviet social system, the Soviet political system, no one exploits anyone, and the goals of the workers and the Soviet state are consistent. These conditions determine the aforementioned combination." "Therefore, the collective contract is a document of first-rate national economic significance and first-rate political and educational significance." These three short paragraphs are enough to express the spirit and characteristics of this book. It not only exposes the false 'justice' disguise used in collective contracts in capitalist countries, but also fully clarifies the rich meaning contained in Soviet collective contracts. If we read this book carefully from beginning to end, it will definitely give us great inspiration and gain. Here, I want to add a note: As far as I have seen, there are four translations of this book. In addition to the translation listed above, there are the following three translations:
    Translated by Qin Yi, published by the Mass Bookstore 《Collective Contracts in the Soviet Union》
    Translated by Li Xiangchong, published by the Sino-Foreign Publishing House 《Soviet Collective Contracts》
    Translated by Lin Da, published by the Zhonghua Book Company 《Collective Contracts in the Soviet Union》
    In addition, the book 《Collective Contracts》 (compiled and printed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore) is also worth reading. It makes a correct explanation of the relationship between collective contracts and the labor efficiency wage system, and then introduces the actual experience of Soviet enterprises and Northeast enterprises in signing collective contracts. At the same time, we can see from here how significant the role of collective contracts is in implementing the economic accounting system.

　　介绍一批苏联经济建设书籍（中）
    刘及辰
    三、关于加强和贯彻经济核算制的
    上次介绍的那些书，是着重在苏联整个国民经济计划方面的；以下让我进而介绍一些关于苏联企业内部计划的书。
    苏联整个国民经济计划的基础是建筑在企业内部计划上的；而企业内部计划的关键又是在经济核算制的实行。所谓经济核算制，就是领导每个社会主义企业的原则：“它的目的在于有系统地提高每一卢布的开支与每吨原料燃料的经济效果，并在于提高劳动生产率与减低生产费”；“它的任务，在于保证最合理的、最节约的生产组织”。苏联经济核算制的实行，保证了苏联经济计划的精确进行与提早完成，给苏联社会主义社会积累了巨额的财富。我们东北国营企业，由于学习苏联实行了经济核算制，已经在减低成本、增加利润以及提高产品质量上获得了显著成绩。今后我国公私企业，都应立即向东北看齐，实行经济核算制，积累资金，扩大再生产，以加速恢复和发展我们的国民经济。
    我要介绍的关于经济核算制的书有下列几种：
    《社会主义社会的经济核算制》（上、下辑）
          东北财经委员会调查统计处译印
    《如何贯彻经济核算制》    东北新华书店编印
    《加强经济核算制克服工业生产中的浪费》
          东北新华书店编印
    《定额管理》    东北新华书店编印
    上列四本书（《社会主义社会的经济核算制》下辑除外，后面另有说明），前两本是着重在经济核算制理论上的分析和阐明，后两本是偏重于一般应用上的说明和介绍，都该算是目前学习经济核算制的好书。
    《社会主义社会的经济核算制》上辑，原系一九四四年苏联政治文献出版局出版的。它从理论上系统地阐明了关于经济核算制的一系列的问题，是了解经济核算制本质的一本好书。本书首先是由计划经济经由价值法则来说明经济核算制的，它指出：“社会主义社会的价值法则是以新的形式存在的……在社会主义社会中它不是盲目地运动法则，而是社会所意识到的、利用为社会主义计划经济的工具”，“社会主义社会下价值法则所发生的作用，不是引起物质与劳动的浪费，不是引起社会财富和社会生产力的无味消失；相反的，为合理并有计划地运用价值法则而展开的斗争，必能保证物质和劳动最大的节省，保证社会资源与社会主义社会全民福利的增长。”而使社会能够有计划地运用价值法则，那就必须使企业实行经济核算制；所以“经济核算制就是企业活动最合理的、最能使企业活动适应价值法则任务的组织形式。”由此可知，经济核算制是和计划经济分不开的。本书也明确地指出了：“经济核算制只有在它服从计划，服务于计划并为完成计划而斗争的时候，它才能完成自己的任务。”要想服从计划和完成计划，也必要照顾到社会主义社会的全面利益；否则，若用计划外的办法以提高利润，那就是阻碍整个经济发展的违反国家的行为。“因此，经济核算制的领导必须是布尔什维克的，在推行经济核算制的原则时，必须照顾社会主义社会的全面利益，因为只有为了这种利益而进行斗争，才能获得共产主义的胜利。”其次说明货币和经济核算制的关系；苏联经济核算制只有通过货币计算才能实现，诸如制定计划、计算成本、判别社会必需的劳动消费量、以及那些包括在经济核算制中的具有刺激作用的各种制度，都必须通过货币计算。所以“在管理社会主义企业方面，为了实现统计和监督以及实行经济核算制，没有货币是不可能的；因为在社会主义的发展阶段中，找不到另一种可以统计整个经济的工具。”此外，对于经济核算制企业资金的组织、国营社会主义企业的商品成本、成本价值与价格、经济合同与商业经济核算制、企业的收支平衡，以及国家利用货币流转实现卢布对计划执行进程的监督等等，都做了有系统的分析和阐述。《社会主义社会的经济核算制》下辑是由四篇译文汇集的，内容十九和《如何贯彻经济核算制》、《加强经济核算制克服工业生产中的浪费》两书重复，后两书能包括前者，而前书却不能包括后二者，在这里就不再介绍了。
    《如何贯彻经济核算制》，篇幅较大，有三百六十页，包括的方面很多，是关于经济核算制的一本综合性的书。所讲的不仅是经济核算制的本身问题，还包括了业务领导问题和贯彻经济核算制的种种方法问题。内容新颖丰富，值得我们一读。特别其中的埃·布列格里的《苏联经济核算制的本质》和可凡烈夫的《个别经济核算制是提高利润的重要方法》两篇，是我们更须要精研细读的。该书第一篇首先叙述的是苏联经济核算制的发展，说明了经济核算制在社会主义建设的各阶段中，其内容或实行方法都有着本质上的变化。苏联政府起初“深知重工业对于改革全部国民经济和提高国家经济力量及国防力量方面的意义，而对于暂不能生利的企业特别是重工业给以财政上的必要援助。”以后随着社会主义经济和技术的发展，“苏联政府为使全部重工业都成为国民经济的生利部门，便于一九三六年完全废除了对于企业的补助制度而施行了有关巩固经济核算制的各种方策。”这样一来，“各工业人民委员部便从一九三五年至一九三九年这一期间所得的利润总计，已由四十一亿增加为九十九亿，即增加到两倍以上。”苏联经济核算制的内容及其方法的这种变化，使国家增加了如此巨额的财富，这完全是靠着苏联政府能巧妙地掌握经济发展的规律并适当地采用了正确的方策。在我们新民主主义社会的经济建设道路中，苏联的这个经验是再宝贵没有的。其次说明的是苏联经济核算制的特征，先把社会主义经济核算制和资本主义的“经济性原则”之不同做了一个本质上的分析：“所谓‘经济性原则’就是对于一切事情，毫无止境地去追求利润”，而“社会主义的经济核算制原则，恰和这资本主义‘经济性原则’相反，因为它的基础并不是个人利益而是社会全体的利益。”接着就又提出了社会主义经济核算制的基本特征：“经济核算的根本特征，就是唤起各企业在物质上对其业务成绩的关心，以刺激各企业的活动，使其完成和超过完成计划。”“苏联对企业的财政政策是为了加强以经济核算制来管理企业，废止以往多年用政府经费来增加企业的固定资本及流动资本的办法，而采取了尽量倚靠企业本身积累来增加其固定资本及流动资金的办法。”苏联的这两点经验，对于我们的企业管理和经营也是非常宝贵的。凡各企业经理及其他从事管理企业的人都要把以上两点经验时刻记在心头，设法使其实现。
    其次，可凡烈夫的《个别经济核算制是提高利润的重要方法》这篇文章，主要的是介绍了苏联个别经济核算的经验和成就。以前苏联企业经济核算制的推行，“被认为只能以工场为单位，最多也只能以一班为单位……个别工人的节约指数是不加以计算的。”但自从最近推行了个别经济核算制以后，产品质量又大见提高了。毕连智尼可夫斯克苏打工厂的经验告诉我们说：“个别经济核算制能造成超计划的积累，更好的利用流动资金，提高生产技术知识，改造产品的质量。”这是苏联最新的宝贵经验，值得我们学习的。
    “加强经济核算制克服工业生产中的浪费”，主要的是讲经济核算制上一般技术问题的，它对于生产费用的分类、成本的组成、计算成本的方法、减低生产品成本的方法，以及提高质量的方法等等，均有说明。在契尔柯夫的《生产费用的分类及成本的组成部分》这一篇中，首先提出的就是一个典型的费用分类项目（项目繁多，不便列举），同时并说明了分类的意义：“为了知道制成品和半制成品的生产成本，必须按照以上所列的项目对一切费用加以估计”，“生产品成本的核算的正确建立，是受着费用分类……来决定的。”契尔诺夫的《怎样降低生产品的成本》一篇，对于影响生产品成本变化的基本因素，诸如对于劳动生产率物材的消费、行政管理和销售费用等等影响到生产品成本变化的要素，都做了简明的分析和说明。另外，曹鲁的《关于标准成本计算》和《标准规格的管理问题》两篇，也是值得一读的好材料。前一篇所讨论的是关于原料标准成本、人工标准成本、标准制造费用、以及标准制造工费等等的订定问题；后一篇是关于战后工厂原材料的购入问题及用购入品生产成品的标准规格管理问题。
    《定额管理》，是讲定额问题的，它告诉我们说：“所谓定额，这就是根据一定的技术水平和技术设备来确定一定产品的标准质量，确定为生产该项产品所使用的原料、材料、人员的标准数，确定生产某种产品的标准生产时间，确定使用某种机器在一定时日产品的标准数量，确定各种经费的标准数量，确定机器的折旧等等。”本书有斯大林的《新的人材和新的技术定额》一篇，这里批评了以技术落后性为出发点而规定的技术定额的缺点，批评了离开实践而讲科学原理的错误观点，批评了不需要任何技术定额的错误观点，同时又正确地指示了一个规定定额的标准：“我们现在所需要的技术定额，应该是一个介乎现行技术定额与斯达汉诺夫和布塞根等人所达到的标准间的定额。”这种平均先进的定额和动员企业内部潜在力量有着密切关系。第二篇伊凡诺夫的《论平均先进定额与工业潜力》，就是阐明这个问题的。它在说明了为了发动企业潜力在规定定额时所应加考虑的种种问题以外，并介绍了由各个不同的经济部门引起的各个生产要素的作用不同，及由苏联国家计划所规定的技术定额的分类。另外，本书还有几篇介绍了东北工业实行定额管理的经验，也是很有价值的。
    以上所介绍的是关于经济核算制一般的书籍；另外还有几本属于技术应用方面、处理个别问题的、更切合具体实用的小册子，也都很好，兹介绍于左：

          时代出版社发行
    《工业企业的技术工业财务计划》，是一九四八年作者在莫斯科苏联全国政治和科学知识普及协会所作公开讲演的记录。这里首先指出了旧的工业财务计划的缺点在哪里，并如何制定新的正确的技术工业财务计划。其次说明了技术工业财务计划的任务是什么，它的内容包括着多少部分，怎样编制技术工业财务计划，全年的怎样做，季度的怎样做，准备阶段有几个步骤，都是怎样做的，完成阶段是怎样做的等。最后说明了怎样执行状况的核算和监督，并根据那些文件去执行。本书简明扼要，条理清晰，是从事企业经营管理工作者的一本优良读物。
    《减低成本的途径》，简明而生动地描写出荣获列宁勋章及劳动红旗勋章的莫斯科“镰刀与铁锤”冶金工厂的工作经验，它对于该厂是怎样争取了高度劳动生产率、减低生产费的途径，以及如何实施了经济核算制和其所获得的成就等等具体情况，都做了生动的介绍。（作家书屋也有此种译本，名为《苏联工厂减低成本的经验》）。
    《苏联机械制造业之生产费及成本减低法》，是著者布尔墨斯特洛夫根据他在机械制造业计划部门中继续工作二十五年所搜集的材料和他与各工厂及车间的计划部门工作者们讨论的结果而写成的，它对于生产费、产品单位成本计算、成本降低计划，以及成本费和成本降低法等等，都做了简洁的说明，并附有图表，以资参考。本书内容虽着重在机械制造业，然有许多材料亦可通用在一般企业上。
    《工业企业固定资产的计算》，把苏联工业企业对于固定资产的会计处理、分类及估价等经验，都做了一个科学的具体的且有系统的介绍。这里对于流动资金与固定资产给了一个明确的概念，并指出了应该怎样去划分类别，怎样去进行折旧。书中列有实例图表，明确具体，切合实际应用。
    《苏联工业企业如何运用流动资金》，是一本小册子，是苏联真理报经济编辑比尔曼在莫斯科中央讲演厅的一篇讲演稿子。它对于工业企业运动资金的具体组织，加速工业企业流动资金周转率的种种方法，以及加速流动资金周转率在国民经济发展上所起的重大效能等，都作了详尽的分析。并且从本书中我们还可以看出，苏联企业流动资金的使用远比资本主义国家的为优越：“美国的资本主义企业如有一个美元的固定资产，总须有一个半美元的流动资金，这是不得已的勾当；但同时在苏联的工业中，如有一个卢布的固定资产，则只须有较固定资产为少的七○个哥比的流动资金。利用社会主义的经济财富，有很多的企业从流动资金的使用中，得到了非常大的成就……。”在苏联计划经济制度下，克服了资本主义国家企业种种不合理的使用，使流动资金逐年增长，达成了庞大的数量：“一九四八年一年中流动资金的增加额即达一百七亿卢布，一九四九年随着国民经济力的增大而投向流动资金的新资金已达二百三十六亿卢布。”
    《贸易部门经常费支出计划》，是一本关于贸易部门经费核算的难得的好书。它首先对于贸易部门经常费给了一个明确的概念；接着就简洁地说明了经常费减低的条件、经常费在考核成绩上的重要意义、编制经常费计划支出的重要原则、货物流转及商品类别对于经常费支出水准的影响关系、以及劳动生产力对工资支出水准的影响等等问题；其次，是把分析经常费支出的重要性和分析工作的主要方法，加了一个比较详细的说明；最后，更详尽地分析了经常费支出项名称，把它分为十八项，分别地说明了它们在贸易部门中所具有的意义和计算的方法。本书是从事贸易部门工作者必读的一本好书。
    经济核算制，决不是仅靠统计和会计数字就可以实行得好的，更必须走群众路线。诸如发动劳动竞赛，设立工厂委员会，彻底实行民主管理，实行合理化建议，以及实行责任制等等，都是加强和贯彻经济核算制的重要方法。关于这类的书，我读过的有下列的几本：
    《生产竞赛》        新华书店编印
    《企业管理民主化》            东北新华书店编印
    《合理化建议》      东北新华书店编印
    《生产责任制》      东北新华书店编印
    《集体合同在苏联》            巴舍尔斯特尼科著、立群译
              东北新华书店印行
    列宁早就看到竞赛是社会主义建设的主要力量。他在工农取得了政权后第二天，就把组织竞赛规定为当前的重要任务之一。上列《生产竞赛》一书中第一篇文章，就是列宁那时为了号召组织竞赛而发表的。列宁揭破了资产阶级作家们对于资本主义制度的竞争和私人进取心极端赞美的欺骗性，指出了社会主义社会是破天荒第一次造成真正大规模运用比赛的可能。同时他又号召了广大人民要对资本主义社会残留下来的恶疾糟粕，诸如顽固守旧、奴才习气、自私自利、疏忽、草率、急躁、胆怯以及其他腐败习惯，去作殊死的斗争。他最后指示给大家：“只有把理论和实践结合起来，才会扫除那些保守思想，才能建立一种新的劳动态度。”本书另外的几篇，是关于斯达汉诺夫运动的文章，叙说了劳动在苏联是一种多么光荣的、高贵的、勇敢的、和英雄的事业。劳动在苏联所发挥的积极性和创造性是多么伟大而无穷尽的。要之，苏联企业经济核算制的贯彻实行，计划经济的超额完成，主要是靠着社会主义竞赛的。
    《企业管理民主化》一书，其中一部分指出了为了搞好生产应如何走群众路线，另一部分是分别地说明了企业管理化的组织形式及其具体组织的办法。第三部分是介绍了苏联企业部门的生产会议，指出了苏联企业内部的生产会议是工人和企业结合着血肉相关的感情机构，它成了苏联工业最伟大的原动力，它成了决定工厂重要问题，努力动员并应用超计划完成生产任务的一切可能，以及广泛开展自我批评、克服缺点、发扬创造性积极性的园地。
    《合理化建议》一书介绍了苏联实行合理化建议的经验及其成就。合理化建议是苏联管理工厂和贯彻经济核算制的重要方法之一，不消说它也是依靠工人阶级办好工厂加强经济核算制的群众路线的最好方法之一。它是民主管理工厂的生动体现，没有它，苏联的工业不会有像今日那样的辉煌而活跃的发展。苏联在一九四九年上半年仅仅钢铁工业所提出的合理化建议就有五万五千多件，使劳动效率提高了百分之十六，生产成本降低了百分之七。
    《生产责任制》一书，是叙述了东北铁路和某些工厂学习苏联经验而实行责任制的成绩和苏联的一长制的。本书第一篇为斯大林的《劳动组织》（一九三一年在经济工作人员会议上的演说），这里批判了对于不断生产制的曲解和无人负责的现象，并正确地指示出了“现在的任务是要消灭无人负责现象，改善劳动组织，在企业里正确布置劳动力”。其次几篇是介绍了东北乘务负责制、安东公营工厂的生产责任制、本溪铸造厂改行的三班专责制以及华北农业机械总厂专责制的经验和成绩。在这几篇里，把责任制的特质、优点，无人负责现象存在的原因和产生的环境，对于负责制的某些曲解，以及应该如何推行负责制等等问题，都有详细的说明及介绍。
    最后，《集体合同在苏联》一书，著者是苏联的法学博士，他依据苏联劳动法及其他有关法规阐明了苏联集体合同政治的、法律的与道德的意义，这是本书的特点。在他依据法律条文阐明集体合同的意义时说：“苏联的集体合同是一种双方的政治经济文件。其中不仅包括法律条文，并且包括社会主义道德的条文，这道德的意义是很大的。但这并不是无目的与不负责的援引‘正义’或‘善良道德’，像资产阶级法律所规定的契约中所常包含的一样，其实他们的那些条款不过是想证明剥削阶级的任意胡闹都是正确的而已。”又说：“政治、道德及法律因素在集体合同中之结合为一重要特点，显示苏联集体合同与资本主义国家集体合同之间的差异。苏联社会制度之社会主义的性质，苏联的政治制度，没有人剥削人，劳动者与苏维埃国家之目标一致，这些条件决定了前述的结合。”“因此，集体合同，就是有第一等的国民经济意义及第一等的政治教育意义的文件。”这短短的三段话，就足以表现出本书的精神和特点。这里不但揭穿了资本主义国家集体合同中所援用的虚假的‘正义’伪装，且又充分地阐明了苏联集体合同中所包含的内容丰富的涵义。我们若把本书从头至尾仔细读一遍，一定会给我们以很大的启示和收获。这里我要附带说明一下：这本书，就我已见到的，有四种译本，除前列译本外，还有下列三种译本：
    秦佚译、大众书店版《苏联的集体合同》
    李相崇译、中外出版社版《苏联集体合同》
    林达译、中华书局版《苏联的集体合同》
    另外还有《集体合同》（东北新华书店编印）一书，也有一读的价值。它把集体合同和劳动效率工资制度的关系做了一个正确的说明，复又介绍了苏联企业和东北企业签订集体合同的实际经验。同时我们由这里可以看出，集体合同对于贯彻经济核算制所发挥的作用是如何的重大。
