[Beijing Municipal News Agency] In order to prevent explosions, fires, and other harmful incidents, and to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the broad masses of people in the capital and its cultural heritage buildings, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has decided to implement measures for the relocation of factories manufacturing dangerous goods such as explosives, flammables, and toxic or malodorous substances within a specified time limit. All such factories located in the urban area and surrounding suburbs, whether publicly owned, privately owned, or jointly owned by public and private entities, must comply with the requirement to relocate to a designated area in the southern suburbs within the specified time limit. Within the designated area, factories are only permitted to be located at sites at least 300 meters away from highways, railways, villages, power lines, telephone lines, and other such infrastructure. The deadlines for the relocation of various types of factories are calculated from today: match factories, a deadline of four months; firecracker workshops, a deadline of two months; mineral oil refineries, a deadline of four months; other factories manufacturing explosive, flammable, toxic, or malodorous substances, such as sulfur factories and phosphorus sulfide factories, will be subject to separate relocation deadlines to be determined after investigation. All such factories located outside the urban and suburban areas should report to the Public Security Bureau within half a month from today for inspection and handling. After finding a suitable factory site in the designated area in the southern suburbs, each factory should immediately submit three copies of detailed drawings to the Public Security Bureau, the Bureau of Industry, and the Bureau of Construction for application and inspection, and construction can only begin after approval. Any factory that intends to wait and see or delay compliance, and still fails to relocate after the deadline, the Municipal People's Government will not only seal its manufacturing tools and forcibly relocate its raw materials and finished products, but may also order it to cease operations and revoke its business license.

[Another Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government has stipulated the following boundaries for the designated area in the southern suburbs to which factories manufacturing dangerous goods must relocate:

	1. Eastern Boundary: From Zuo'anmen southward, passing through Xiaoshuangqiao Village, Chengshousi Village, Hongsi Village, to Guanjiazhuang.
	2. Western Boundary: From You'anmen southward, passing through Jiao'erbu, Dayouzhuang, to Xingong Village.
	3. Southern Boundary: From Xingong Village in the west eastward, passing through Wangjiazhuang, Hejiazhuang, Wudian Village, to Guanjiazhuang.
	4. Northern Boundary: From 1,500 meters outside You'anmen in the west to 1,500 meters outside Zuo'anmen in the east.
