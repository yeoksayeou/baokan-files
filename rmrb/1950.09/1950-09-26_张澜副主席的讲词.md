Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Central People's Government Vice Chairman Zhang Lan's speech at the opening ceremony of the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference and the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representative Conference. The full text is as follows:

Chairman:

Dear comrades, representatives of national combat heroes, and comrades, representatives of national labor models:

I feel unparalleled honor and excitement to participate in the opening ceremony of this representative conference today and to meet with you all so warmly.

Esteemed representatives, it is under the leadership of Chairman Mao that the Chinese people were liberated from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and China was able to quickly heal and recover from the wounds of war, and begin the construction cause at an early date. You embody a banner symbolizing the brilliant victories achieved on the military front and on the production front; you will forever be the symbol of victory and glory. The reason you have this victory and glory is inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and inseparable from the establishment of the new China and the arrival of the new era. Looking back at the past under reactionary rule, our working people could only endure the pain of being beasts of burden; we were not allowed to become heroes or models, and there was no such glory as today. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can all people give full play to their talent, knowledge, and creativity in the cause of revolution and the masses, achieve great accomplishments, and become heroes and models, respected and praised by the people.

Today's grand, unprecedented, and historically significant conference is certainly to commend the heroes and models on the military front and the production front, and also to "encourage the frontline troops to thoroughly annihilate the remaining bandits, and to reduce the burden on the people and develop the production movement; to encourage workers across the country to develop a new attitude towards labor, overcome difficulties, and increase labor productivity; and to encourage farmers across the country to implement mutual aid in production, improve technology, cultivate deeply and meticulously, increase agricultural production, and expand cultivated land area"; to exchange and summarize experiences and lessons so as to further improve the cause of consolidating national defense and developing the economy in the future. The presence of you representatives at this conference is truly a victorious gathering of combat heroes and labor models from all over the country, demonstrating the strength of the people of the new China, with unparalleled heroic fighting spirit and a great diligent work attitude. It is truly a grand gathering of founding heroes and nation-building heroes of the new China.

I would like to shout to you with infinite excitement:

Long live the great unity of the working people!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live Chairman Mao!

    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民政府张澜副主席在全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议开幕典礼上的讲词。全文如下：主席：
    亲爱的全国战斗英雄代表同志们、和全国劳动模范代表同志们：
    本人今天参加这个代表会议开幕典礼、和您们热烈的见面，实在感觉无上的光荣、无限的兴奋。
    各位代表们，是在毛主席的领导下，使中国人民从蒋介石匪帮统治下获得解放，使中国由战争创伤中得以迅速医治恢复，早日开始建设事业。在您们的身上，是象征着从军事战线上、从生产战线上取得光辉胜利的一面旗帜；在您们的身上，永远是标志着胜利和光辉。您们所以有了这种胜利和光辉，是和中国共产党的领导分不开的，是和新中国的建立、新时代的到来分不开的。回想过去在反动统治之下，我们劳动人民是只有做牛马的痛苦，是不让我们成为英雄、成为模范的，那里还有像今天这样的光荣。只有在共产党的领导之下的一切人们，都可在为革命为群众的事业中，尽量发挥自己的天才知识和创造性，获得伟大的成就，使自己成为英雄，成为模范，被人民敬佩，被人民表扬。
    在今天举行的这个盛大的空前的有历史意义的会议里，固然是来表扬军事战线上和生产战线上的英雄和模范，并且是要“为了鼓励前线部队彻底歼灭残余匪帮，和为了减轻人民负担、开展生产运动；为了鼓励全国工人发扬新的劳动态度，克服困难、提高劳动生产率；并为了鼓励全国农民实行生产互助，改进技术，深耕细作、增加农业生产、扩大耕地面积”；来交换和总结经验教训，以便今后把巩固国防事业和发展经济事业更提高一步。各位代表同志们来出席这个会议，真正是全国各地战斗英雄和劳动模范的胜利大会师，是显示了新中国人民的力量，具有无比的英勇的战斗精神、和伟大辛勤的劳动态度。真正是新中国开国功臣、建国功臣的大会合。
    我谨以无限的兴奋心情，向您们高呼：
    劳动人民大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
