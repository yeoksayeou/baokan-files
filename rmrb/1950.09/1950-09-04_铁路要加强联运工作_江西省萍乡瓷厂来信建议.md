To the Editorial Staff:

　　We are experiencing a transportation problem, and we hope you will publish it to find a suitable solution.

　　Most of the electrical porcelain manufactured in our factory is transported to the Central China Telecommunications Bureau in Hankou. However, when we ship from Luxi Station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the railway bureau often does not attach the carriages when it reaches the Yuehan Railway; or after it is transported to Wudong, the original carriages cannot be brought back quickly. This increases the difficulty of transportation for us, because if we unload the goods in Zhuzhou and load them onto the Yuehan Railway carriages, the freight will not be cost-effective, and the loss of porcelain will be very large. According to our estimation, the reason for this phenomenon is, on the one hand, the implementation and inspection of the intermodal transportation method is not enough; on the other hand, it may be because our freight is paid to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, and the Yuehan Railway did not get the freight, so they are not happy to transport it. We hope that the Ministry of Railways will strengthen supervision and inspection in this regard at any time, so as to avoid the phenomenon of uncoordinated intermodal transportation between various railway bureaus.

### 铁路要加强联运工作  江西省萍乡瓷厂来信建议

　　铁路要加强联运工作  江西省萍乡瓷厂来信建议编辑同志：
    我们有一个运输上的困难问题，希望你们发表，以便求得适当解决。
    我们厂里制造的电瓷，大部分运往汉口华中电信局。可是我们从浙赣铁路卢溪车站起运，到粤汉路的时候，路局方面多半不把车皮挂上；或者运到武东以后，不能把原车皮迅速的带回来。这就增加了我们运输上的困难。因为如果我们在株州卸货，再装上粤汉路的车皮，运费既不合算，而且瓷品的损失也很大。据我们估计，发生这种现象的原因，一方面是联运方法的贯彻与检查不够；另一方面，可能因为我们的运费是缴给浙赣路局的，粤汉路没有得到运费，所以不高兴运。希望铁道部在这方面随时加强监督检查，以免发生各路局联运不调协的现象。
