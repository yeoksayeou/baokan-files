　　Inner Mongolia Model Herdsmen's Heartfelt Words
　　Grassland Herdsmen Love Chairman Mao
　　[This dispatch from Zhangjiakou] According to the Inner Mongolia Daily: Ha Yin Jin and Zhong Dui, two model herdsmen from Inner Mongolia attending the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, asked a reporter to write down their heartfelt words for Chairman Mao while passing through Zhangjiakou on their way to Beijing. They wanted to let Chairman Mao know how much the herdsmen on the Inner Mongolian grasslands respect and love him. Zhong Dui, who grew up in the Second Baga of Huerlehouzuo in Chen Barag Right Banner, wanted to tell Chairman Mao: "When the Japanese were in the grasslands, all the good horses, cattle, and sheep were driven away by them. There was no freedom to prevent fires or hunt wolves. Herdsmen who bought poison to poison wolves were also arrested and punished by the Japanese. When Hulunbuir League was liberated on August 15th, there were only 600,000 head of livestock left. Since the Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Chairman Ulanhu came, we have a home. The league has established a livestock epidemic prevention team and organized us to prevent fires, hunt wolves, and dig wells. Now the four banners have increased their livestock to more than 1,030,000 head, our lives are getting better and better every day, and our livestock is increasing year by year. Grassland women used to suffer the most, but now they are liberated. Many women have joined the government and are truly equal to men. They are all grateful to Chairman Mao. After the children launched model competitions in their studies, their enthusiasm for learning is even higher. I used to be oppressed by feudal forces, with no food and no clothing, no matter how hard I worked, I was still a pauper. Today, our lives have improved, and we can even enter the government, which is something I never even dreamed of before.” Ha Yin Jin from the Fifth Group of the Fifth Zuo of the Western United Banner of Xilin Gol League said: "I never thought I would go to Beijing to attend the meeting. I hope that I can see Chairman Mao, who is most respected by the herdsmen, this time. Because the lives of the people in the grasslands have improved under the leadership of Chairman Mao, people like me who used to graze livestock for the herdbosses all my life now have a home and herds of horses, cattle, and sheep. I have also become a labor model.” He also said: "I am sixty years old now, and I can still live for a few more years and graze horses for a few more years. I will work hard to increase one hundred horses to nine hundred in four years." Finally, he also wanted to tell Chairman Mao: "The bandits in the grasslands have been eliminated, and now the only thing that harms livestock is wolves. I am an accurate shooter, and I have a fast gun awarded to me by the government. I will eliminate more wolf pests for the herdsmen in the grasslands."

　　内蒙牧业劳动模范的心里话
    草原牧人热爱毛主席
    【本报张家口讯】据内蒙古日报消息：内蒙出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的牧业劳模哈音金及忠对二人，于赴京途经张家口时，要记者替他们写下心里话转告毛主席，他们要让毛主席知道内蒙古草原上的牧人，是如何地尊敬与爱戴他。生长在陈巴尔虎右旗胡尔勒后佐第二巴嘎的忠对要告诉毛主席：“过去日本人在草地的时候，好的马、牛、羊都被他们赶走了。防火、打狼根本没有自由，牧民买毒药毒狼也被日本人抓去处罚。呼纳盟“八一五”解放当时只剩下六十万匹牧畜，自从共产党、毛主席、乌兰夫主席来了，使我们有了家，盟内设立了家畜防疫队，并为我们组织防火、打狼、打井等。现在四个旗牲畜已增加到一百零三万多头了，我们的生活一天比一天好了，我们的牲畜一年比一年多了。草地的妇女过去最受苦，现在解放了。很多妇女参加了政府工作，真正和男子一样。她们都在感谢毛主席。儿童们学习展开了模范竞赛后，学习情绪更高。我过去是受封建势力的压迫，没有吃、没有穿，任凭怎样劳动也是穷光蛋，今天我们的生活改善了，而且能走进政府，真是从前想也没想到的事。”锡林郭勒盟西部联合旗第五佐第五小组的哈音金说：“我真想不到要到北京去参加会议。我希望着自己这次能够见到牧民们最尊敬的毛主席。因为草地的人民在毛主席的领导下生活已经改善，像我这样过去一辈子给牧主放牧的人，现在有了家，有了马、牛、羊群。我还成了劳动模范。”他又说：“我现在六十岁了，我还能够活几年，还能够放几年马，我要努力把一百匹马在四年中放到九百匹。”最后他还要告诉毛主席：“草地的土匪已被肃清，现在危害牲畜的就是狼；我是一个射击准确的猎手，我有一支政府奖给我的快枪，我要在草地为牧民多除狼害。”
