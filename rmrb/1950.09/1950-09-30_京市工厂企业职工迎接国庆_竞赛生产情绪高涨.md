Beijing Factory and Enterprise Workers Greet National Day
    Competing in Production with High Morale

[Report from this newspaper] Workers in many factories and enterprises in Beijing are competing in production to greet the National Day of the new China. All the workers of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory have been enthusiastically engaged in a production competition since September 1st. In the past half month, the red curves on the production charts of each workshop have been rising continuously, and the gray lines of defective products have been declining continuously. For example, the Yang Zheng Gang team in the forging workshop completed the entire monthly production task of 4,000 plow blades and 4,000 sets of hooks for September in fifteen days; only two of these 8,000 products were defective. The steel rolling department originally planned to roll 38,000 catties of steel in twenty days, but as a result of the competition, they completed 70,000 catties in sixteen days. In coal alone, they saved 4,400 catties of millet for the people. Other products, such as plow bottom plates and flanges in the casting workshop, and plow assembly work in the fitter workshop, have been continuously improving in quality, and the defect rate has been greatly reduced compared with August. In terms of tool improvement: for example, engineer Zhang Dejun and Wang Wanjun designed a dynamometer for the horse-drawn plow, which has been successfully trial-produced by worker Wang Zhaochen; technician Li Zhenyu has improved the mountain plow as a gift for National Day. To greet National Day, engineer Chen Li and technician Zhou Liang are studying the improvement of the new-style windmill. In the tool factory, due to the close cooperation between workers and technicians in the competition, two special and important machines (eight-wheel shovel tooth machines) that had been abandoned for a long time were repaired, with a value of about 450,000 catties of millet, as a gift to National Day.

To greet National Day, the employees of the Water Company strive to ensure that the citizens in urban areas can basically eat and use cheap and clean tap water as a National Day gift. According to statistics as of September 25, the population in urban areas using tap water has increased from 50% at the beginning of this year to 83%. Two other gifts from the company's employees to celebrate National Day are: First, the Mentougou tap water installation project was completed ten days ahead of schedule on September 23. Workers in the Mentougou district and nearby farmers no longer need to drink water extracted from coal kilns with a lot of sulfur, or very dirty river water. Second, in order to solve the drinking water problem for the parade on National Day, the workers rushed to complete the task of connecting 2,500 meters of water pipes and 200 water taps near Tiananmen Square in four days. At least 1,000 tons of water can be supplied on that day. This task usually takes half a month.

The Beijing Machine General Factory and its branches launched a "Do One Thing Well" campaign to greet National Day. The heads of the factory's Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League took the lead in formulating personal plans to do one thing well. Now, more than 1,000 employees in the factory are actively and conscientiously using "Do One Thing Well" as a gift to National Day. Due to the different work of each department, the specific content of the competition for the employees of the tram company is also different. In addition to exceeding the annual production task four months ahead of schedule as a National Day gift, the repair factory also proposed to further develop the competition to improve quality by establishing finished product specifications and strengthening maintenance; the vehicle road department launched a competition to ensure good driving intervals, maintain the cleanliness of the car, and strive to eliminate personal accidents. The employees of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau are celebrating National Day by improving tools and eliminating faults, and have also made many outstanding achievements. Under the slogan of "Increase Production and Reduce Costs," the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory has been carrying out production competitions since September. As of the preliminary statistics on the 26th, most workshops and teams have completed their tasks ahead of schedule. For example, the rubber workshop completed the entire month's production task in just fourteen days since the competition started; other units such as the copper sleeve group and the forging workshop completed the entire month's task before September 23. A total of more than 1,150 work hours were saved, and about 6,000 catties of coal were saved. In addition, special handicraft companies and the North China Coal Mine Trade Union are also actively preparing National Day gifts. The special handicraft company will also hold a special exhibition for domestic and foreign delegations participating in the National Day ceremony, and will also offer special discounts.

　　京市工厂企业职工迎接国庆
    竞赛生产情绪高涨
    【本报讯】北京市不少工厂企业职工，竞赛生产来迎接新中国的国庆日。华北农业机械总厂全体职工自九月一日起热烈展开生产竞赛。近半个月来，全厂各车间里的生产表上红色曲线一直在上升，废品的灰色线条不断下降，如锻工房杨振刚小组，十五天中就完成了四千个犁刀和四千套钩的九月份全月生产任务；这八千件产品中只有两件废品。轧钢部原定二十天轧钢三万八千斤，竞赛结果，以十六天完成七万斤，只是煤斤一项，就给人民省下四千四百斤小米。其他，如铸工房的犁托板、法兰盘；钳工房的犁头装配工作等，质量都在不断提高，废品率较八月份大减。在改良工具方面：如工程师张德俊、王万钧设计了马拉犁上的拉力仪，已由工友王昭宸试制成功；技术员李振宇已把山地犁改良好，作为国庆献礼。工程师陈立、技术员周亮两人为迎接国庆，正研究改良新式风车。工具工厂在竞赛中，由于工人与技术人员的密切合作，把废置已久的两个特种重要机器（八字轮铲齿机）修好，价值约四十五万斤小米，献给国庆。
    自来水公司职工迎接国庆，以争取城区市民都能基本上吃用廉价而清洁的自来水作为国庆献礼，到九月二十五日的统计：城区吃用自来水的人口已由今年初的百分之五十增加到百分之八十三。该公司职工庆祝国庆的另外两个献礼是：第一、提前十天于九月二十三日完成门头沟按装自来水的工程，门头沟区的工人和附近农民再不吃用从煤窑里抽出来的含硫很多的水，或很脏的河水了。第二、为了解决国庆日游行队伍的喝水的问题，工人们在天安门附近，用四天工夫就突击完成接装水管二千五百公尺、水嘴二百个的任务，当天可供水至少一千吨，这任务在平时需要半个月的时间。
    北京机器总厂和各分厂以发起做好“一件事”运动来迎接国庆，该厂党、政、工、团负责人带头拟订个人做好一件事的计划。现在全厂一千多职工都积极认真地以“做好一件事”作为国庆献礼。电车公司的职工由于各部门工作不同，竞赛的具体内容也不一样，修造厂除去把提前四个月超额完成全年生产任务作为国庆节献礼外，还提出以建立成品规格和加强检修来进一步开展提高质量的竞赛；车路上则展开了保证走好行车间隔，保持车内清洁，争取消灭人身事故的竞赛。北京电信局的职工用改进工具和消灭故障庆祝国庆，亦已有很多的突出成就。北京汽车修配厂在“提高产量、降低成本”的口号下，从九月份开始生产竞赛以来，截至二十六日初步统计：已有大部车间小组提前完成任务。如橡胶间自竞赛开始后，仅十四天即完成全月的生产任务；其他如铜套组、锻工间等单位均在九月二十三日前完成了全月任务。共计节省了一千一百五十余工时，省煤约六千斤。另外，特种手工艺公司、华北煤矿工会等单位亦积极准备国庆献礼。特种手工艺公司并为欢迎参加国庆大典的国内外代表团，准备举行特约展览，同时予以特价优侍。
