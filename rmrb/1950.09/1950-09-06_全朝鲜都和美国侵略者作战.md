　　All of Korea Fights Against American Aggressors
　　By Our Special Correspondent in the Korean War Zone, Li Zhuang
　　On the streets of Jongno in the center of Seoul, there is a bright red and very eye-catching slogan that reads: "All of Korea fights against American aggressors!" According to my observations over more than a month, this slogan is entirely in line with the actual situation in Korea. Every patriotic Korean, without exception, participates in this war against American aggression. The sacrifices are significant. However, for the victory of the war, the Korean people consciously and bravely bear these inevitable sacrifices.
　　On July 2nd, an immortal heroic story happened in Seoul. At that time, the Han River Bridge was destroyed by the enemy, and the temporary pontoon bridge became the only passage for the People's Army to advance south to strike the enemy. The pontoon bridge was narrow and soft, and cars had to drive slowly. However, the drivers were willing to cross the Han River quickly and deliver ammunition to the rapidly advancing front-line soldiers as soon as possible. More than twenty trucks loaded with ammunition accumulated on the bridge for a time. Suddenly, the alarm sounded loudly, and American planes came to attack the Han River Bridge, bombing the pontoon bridge frantically. One truck was hit by a rocket, and it immediately burst into flames. Obviously, the damaged truck would explode immediately, and if there was no other way, the pontoon bridge and all the trucks on the bridge would perish together. The situation was extremely critical. Young driver Yoon Myung-yi quietly jumped onto the burning truck, started the engine, and drove into the river. The heroic Yoon Myung-yi sacrificed himself, but with his sacrifice, he saved the pontoon bridge, ammunition, and the lives of dozens of comrades.
　　The Korean working class persists in the patriotic war with unparalleled tenacity. I personally witnessed the Seoul workers fighting stubbornly against the B-29s. In just two months after the liberation of Seoul, American planes attacked the Han River Bridge 2,200 times (cumulative number of one plane at a time), dropping 5,460 bombs, many of which weighed one ton. The Han River Bridge had been destroyed more than fifty times. The workers of Seoul, in collaboration with the workers of the People's Army, repaired it as soon as it was bombed, always ensuring the supply of military and civilian transportation. On July 13th, fifty-four B-29s madly bombed the Han River Bridge, killing and wounding 102 workers. However, the workers were never intimidated by the enemy planes. They worked silently and quickly repaired the bridge again. On July 15th, nineteen B-29s seriously damaged the Han River Bridge again, and the workers repaired it day and night. I had a long conversation with a short, very robust bridge repair worker named Kim Seong-seon. He held a Chinese-style pipe and said humorously, "They (referring to the Americans - editor) are specially scaring people with neurasthenia, but the nerves of us Koreans are very healthy, they can't scare us." Later, American planes adopted a new tactic, specifically using fighter planes to attack bridge repair workers. They might be thinking, "If the Koreans don't dare to go to the bridge, the Han River will never be repaired." Indeed, the Han River Bridge is 1,200 meters long, and it is impossible to avoid a plane attack in the center of the bridge. The workers simply scattered and lay down on the bridge to deal with the enemy, ignoring their frantic strafing. The American planes' "new tactic" failed again.
　　American planes attacked Seoul day and night, which partially affected the city's work, but absolutely failed to force its activities to stop. Water and electricity are supplied steadily. In this rear-area war, the power workers of Seoul showed the same tenacious and heroic spirit. The lines near the Han River Bridge were destroyed by enemy planes 1,890 times at once, and various activities there were once suspended, but the Seoul Telecommunications Bureau mobilized fifty workers and restored these destroyed lines with a day of intense work. The lines from Seoul to Yeongdeungpo were also destroyed by enemy planes 1,810 times at once. Yeongdeungpo is the most important industrial area in Seoul, and the power supply cannot be interrupted. Seoul is about ten kilometers away from Yeongdeungpo, separated by the Han River, and the repair work is quite difficult. The Telecommunications Bureau made an intensive repair plan, with sixty-eight workers, to repair the lines in a week. The working class understands best the significance of power supply for modern industrial production, and they worked at super speed, completing the task in just four days. According to the workers, it is very troublesome to encounter air raids on power poles. However, they dealt with enemy planes with calmness and alertness. When enemy planes approached, they quietly slipped down, and when the sound of the planes faded away, they climbed up to work again. Some workers had to climb up and down a power pole seven or eight times in one work period. When the Syngman Rhee puppet army fled, they buried thirty large time bombs in the power room of the Han River Central Telecommunications Bureau, plotting to turn Seoul into a dark world. The workers discovered the enemy's conspiracy twenty-five minutes before the bombs exploded, and they risked their lives to remove all the bombs.
　　I saw several times the ranks of workers joining the army in Seoul. The people in front carried huge banners of the Republic's national flag, national emblem, and portraits of General Kim Il-sung and Marshal Stalin. Children held flowers. The workers joining the army walked in the middle, wearing oil-soaked work clothes, with red cloths with the words "Volunteer Army" written on their heads. Some people smiled, but most people's faces were as cold as iron blocks, without any expression. At the end of the line were the women who came to see them off and the men who beat gongs and drums. The character of the Korean people was originally very lively, but in this cruel war era, they naturally became serious. This is understandable. At this time, their country is being brutally invaded by brutal enemies, and they are going to the front line, to the battle, and the task of this war is serious. Korean workers are extremely enthusiastic about joining the army. According to Hyun Heung, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Professional League, 17,763 workers in Seoul alone have joined the army. More than 400 female workers from the Chaidenburg Textile Factory volunteered to go to the front line to participate in rescue work. They encountered many attacks by American planes, but the enemy's cruelty increased their hatred of the enemy, and they did not want to return to the rear, and all demanded to join the volunteer army and stay on the front line. The comrades in charge of the troops knew that many of them had children to take care of, and it was difficult to leave home, so they sent many cadres to mobilize them to go back. However, only more than 100 people listened to the advice and returned to the rear, and the remaining three-quarters joined the volunteer army. The Korean newspapers often publish volunteer letters from the entire student body of universities and middle schools requesting to join the army collectively, and young students account for a large proportion of the volunteer army. Of course, the basic members of Korea's 1.3 million new soldiers are still farmers. In a small village of 140 households in Goyang County that I visited, more than 70 farmers joined the volunteer army, an average of one person from every two households.
　　The late August in the solar calendar is the time of the bright moon. In the bright moonlight on the streets of Seoul, a torrent of people constantly passed by, including workers, students, and citizens, men and women, who were going to participate in various restoration works. During the day, American planes can wantonly invade the airspace of Korea. But the early autumn nights, which are convenient for work, belong to the diligent and brave Korean people. Several thousand people participate in the restoration work in Seoul every day, which is one of the important reasons why the city can continue to work. The arduous restoration work is not only in the cities, but also in the countryside. The farmers of Damcheong River left me with unforgettable and profound memories. They took off their clothes and jumped into the cold river to repair the bridges destroyed by enemy planes. Hundreds of people hammered piles together, emitting coordinated, thick, and powerful shouts. During the day, several American planes bombed here for several hours, destroying two holes in the bridge, with craters everywhere nearby. When we passed this bridge, the smell of burnt wood still floated in the fresh air. At night, the farmers gathered hundreds of people, filled in the craters, and hammered wooden stakes, demanding that the bridge be repaired in the shortest possible time.
　　I passed through many villages in Korea. When the children in the village heard the sound of a car, they immediately ran to the street and shouted "Long live!" to the people in the car. The children thought that everyone sitting in the car was a member of the People's Army. Therefore, they expressed their greatest respect to them. I have walked across many bridges in Korea. If the bridges are intact, there must be two or three farmers with spears patrolling and guarding the bridges. Their tasks are twofold: one is to prevent sabotage by special agents; the other is to tell the car drivers if there is an air raid or if something else has happened. If the bridges are destroyed, there must be many farmers who risk danger to participate in the restoration work. And their labor is completely voluntary.
　　I have eaten "fist rice" many times on the front line, which is rice balls made from steamed rice. Some "fist rice" is filled with sugar or pickles. Women volunteer to do the work of cooking for the army, saying that this is one of the best ways for them to participate in the war. However, many of the furniture in the battlefield villages have been destroyed by the Americans and the puppet army, and it is difficult to find bowls, which is a big problem for eating. So this "fist rice" was invented. This kind of rice, if wrapped in paper and stuffed into the soldiers' pockets, is very convenient to carry.
　　In fact, there are two battlefields in Korea, one on the front line and one in the rear. The American aggressor troops are retreating steadily on the front line, where they have suffered heavy blows from the Korean People's Army, and the final victory will undoubtedly belong to the People's Army. However, the American aggressors are extremely cruel, and from the beginning of the war, they have used planes to bomb and strafe peaceful cities and peaceful residents in the rear. The Korean people have to support the life-and-death struggle on the front line on the one hand, and deal with the poisonous attacks from the sky on the other hand, and this burden is quite heavy.
　　In the rear, only the air defense force can directly strike the enemy planes. I visited two air defense officers with the greatest respect. One is Hong Myung-guk, the gunner of the anti-aircraft gun. He is a smart and beautiful young man of nineteen years old. Since the beginning of the war, his gun has shot down thirteen American planes. Once, his anti-aircraft gun was transferred to a new position, and before the cover was completed, the air raid alarm came. Hong Myung-guk and his comrades were digging fortifications while preparing to shoot. This time, the opponent was four American jet planes, which attacked the anti-aircraft gun positions with rockets and machine guns from the east and north. Shortly after the battle began, Hong Myung-guk's comrades were killed and wounded one after another, and finally only he was left. He said, "In this emergency, the most important thing is to be calm. My comrades are lying next to the anti-aircraft gun, and I must avenge them. At this time, I only have one thought - to calculate the speed, direction, and position of the enemy planes." His gun was a good gun, and the gun body was hot, and there was no slightest malfunction. He took off his clothes, wrapped the gun body, reduced the heat, and continued to shoot. So he alone served as ammunition handler, shooter, and observer. He shot down three jet planes in this battle.
　　Hong Myung-guk enlisted in the army on July 15 last year. Last year, he graduated from Pyongyang Public Middle School, left the school gate on the first day, and entered the barracks on the second day. He said, "At that time, I knew that my country was in danger, and the Americans would come to fight us sooner or later. I chose the anti-aircraft gun as my arm of service, and I studied day and night, preparing to strike the aggressors. I have shot down some American planes, and if it does not leave our country, I will continue to shoot it." The other is Choi Sang-moo, the commander of the anti-aircraft gun squadron, who commands four guns. From the beginning of the war to August 10, his guns had shot down twenty American planes. "How was this achievement achieved?" I asked him. He frowned for a moment, and then said: "The enemy is too brutal. My soldiers hate the enemy so much that the rockets exploded right next to them, but they acted as if they didn't hear it. The soldiers all know why they are fighting, so they are not afraid of sacrifice, and this kind of battle is easy to fight. Of course, my soldiers study very well, and their skills are not bad either."
　　This fearless will and determination of the Korean people stems from the basic aspect of the just patriotic war for unification. The righteous people all over the world naturally understand this endless source of power. Even the captured Americans are beginning to recognize this truth. Thompson, a lieutenant pilot of the U.S. 53rd Air Squadron (belonging to the U.S. Seventh Fleet), said: "The United States should not have interfered in the Korean democratic unification war. According to my current view, interference is a waste of effort. The Korean people fight so bravely, they will surely win." Thompson was originally a person with strong American-style fascist ideas. For example, he said: "We came to Korea to fight on the orders of the United Nations. We Americans have the responsibility and the power to carry out police duties in Korea." Now, he has been in the prisoner-of-war camp for more than half a month. He has seen many things, listened to some truths, and is beginning to have some degree of change.
　　"All of Korea fights against American aggressors" has already achieved brilliant results. Under this slogan, American imperialism will inevitably be driven out of Korea in the end.

### 全朝鲜都和美国侵略者作战

　　全朝鲜都和美国侵略者作战
    本报特派朝鲜战地记者  李庄
    在汉城市中心钟路街的街头，贴着一张鲜红的十分醒目的标语，上面写道：“全朝鲜都和美国侵略者作战！”据我一个多月的观察，这个口号是完全合乎朝鲜的实际情况的。每一个爱国的朝鲜人，都毫无例外地参加了这个反对美国侵略的战争。牺牲是重大的。但是，为了战争的胜利，朝鲜人自觉地勇敢地承受了这种不可避免的牺牲。
    七月二日，汉城发生了一件永垂不朽的英勇故事。当时，汉江大桥被敌人炸毁了，临时架成的便桥，成为人民军南下击敌的唯一孔道。便桥又窄又软，汽车必须徐行。但是，司机们都愿意迅速通过汉江，早些把弹药送给飞速进军的前方战士。一时桥上积聚了二十多辆载着弹药的卡车。突然，警报声音大作，美国飞机已来袭击汉江桥，它们对准便桥疯狂轰炸。一辆卡车被火箭炮击中，立刻燃烧起来。显然，负伤的卡车马上就会爆炸，如果没有其他办法，便桥和桥上的全部卡车，都要同归于尽了。情况是万分危急的。青年司机尹明义悄悄地跳上着火的汽车，开足马力，驶入江中，英勇的尹明义是牺牲了，但，他以自己的牺牲，拯救了便桥、弹药和几十个战友的生命。
    朝鲜工人阶级以无比的顽强坚持着爱国战争。我亲眼看到了汉城工人顽强地同Ｂ２９作战的情景。汉城解放不过两月，美国飞机袭击汉江桥已达二千二百次（一机一次累积数）投弹五千四百六十枚，许多炸弹是一吨重的。汉江桥已被炸毁过五十回。汉城的工人协同人民军的工友，随炸随修，始终保证了军需民运。七月十三日，五十四架Ｂ２９狂炸汉江桥，工人死伤一○二人。但是，工人们绝没有被敌机吓倒，他们默默无言的工作，很快又把桥修好了。七月十五日，十九架Ｂ２９又严重地炸毁了汉江桥，工人们又日以继夜地修好了。我曾和一个矮个子的非常茁壮的修桥工人长谈，他的名字叫金星善，他噙着一个中国式的烟斗，很幽默的说：“他们（指美国人——编者）专门吓唬神经衰弱的人，不过，我们朝鲜人的神经都很健康，他们吓不倒我们。”后来，美国飞机采用了一种新战术，专门以战斗机打修桥工人。他们或许在想：“朝鲜人如果不敢走到桥上去，汉江是永远修不好的。”的确，汉江桥长一千二百米，在桥中央遇到飞机袭击，那是躲避不及的。工人们只是、暂时分散伏在桥上来对付敌人，任你如何疯狂扫射，他们都置之不理。美国飞机的“新战术”又失败了。
    美国飞机昼夜袭击汉城，曾经部分地影响了这个城市的工作，但是，绝对未能迫使它的活动停顿下来。水电是源源供应着的。在这种后方的战争中，汉城的电业工人表现了同样的顽强英勇的气概。汉江桥附近的线路一次被敌机炸毁一八九○处，那里的各种活动曾经一度陷于停顿，但是汉城电讯局动员五十个工人，用一天的紧张动作，恢复了这些被毁的线路。汉城到永登浦的线路，也曾一次被敌机炸毁了一八一○处。永登浦是汉城最重要的工业区，电力供应是不能中断的。汉城距永登浦约十公里，中间隔着汉江，修复工程相当艰巨。电讯局作了一个紧张的修复计划，以六十八个工人，用一周时间把线路修好。工人阶级最懂得电力供应对于现代工业生产的意义，他们超速度地工作，结果只用了四天，就完成了任务。据工人们说：在电线杆上遇到空袭，是件很麻烦的事。但是，他们用沉着与机警对付敌机。敌机临空，悄悄地溜下来，机声渐远，再爬上去工作。有的工人曾经一次工作时间内在一个电线杆上爬上爬下七、八回。李承晚傀儡军逃窜时，曾在汉江中央电讯局动力室中埋下三十枚大型定时炸弹，阴谋使汉城成为黑暗世界。工人们在炸弹爆发以前二十五分钟，发现了敌人的阴谋，他们冒着生命的危险，把炸弹扫数取走。
    我在汉城看到好几次工人参军的行列。前面的人抬着巨幅的共和国国旗、国徽和金日成将军、斯大林元帅的画像。儿童拿着鲜花。参军的工人走在中间，他们穿着油浸的工作衣，头上裹着写有义勇军字样的红布。有些人笑着，大部分人的脸却像铁块一样的冷静，没有任何表情。队伍的最后面是送行的妇女和敲锣打鼓的男人。朝鲜人的性格原很活泼，但在这残酷的战争年代里，他们很自然地严肃起来了。这是可以理解的。在这种时候，他们的国家正受着残暴的敌人的野蛮的侵略，他们正在走向前线，走向战斗，而这个战争的任务是严重的。朝鲜工人参军极踊跃。据朝鲜职业同盟中央副委员长玄勋说：仅汉城工人参军者，已有一万七千七百六十三人。柴登堡纺织厂有四百多个女工，自愿到前线参加救护工作。她们遇到许多次美国飞机的袭击，但是，敌人的残酷增加了她们的敌忾，她们都不想再回后方，都要求参加义勇军，留在前线上。部队负责同志晓得她们许多人有孩子拖累，离家是困难的，于是派了许多干部，动员她们回去。但是，听从劝告回到后方的只有一百多人，其余四分之三，都参加了义勇军。朝鲜的报纸上，经常登载着大学、中学全体学生要求集体参军的志愿书，青年学生在义勇军中占了很大的比重。当然，朝鲜一百三十万新战士的基本成员还是农民，我在高阳郡看过的一个一百四十户人家的小村中，就有七十多个农民参加了义勇军，平均两户出去了一人。
    阳历八月下旬，正是月明时节。在汉城街头的明朗月光中，不断走过人的洪流，其中有工人，学生和市民，有男人也有妇女，他们是去参加各种恢复工作的。在白天，美国飞机可以肆无忌惮地侵略朝鲜的领空。但是便于工作的初秋的夜晚，却属于勤苦勇敢的朝鲜人民。汉城每天有几千人参加恢复工作，这是这个城市能够坚持工作的重要原因之一。艰苦的恢复工作，不仅在城市，而且在农村。澹清江的农民留给我难忘的深刻的记忆。他们脱光衣服，跳入清冷的江水中，修复被敌机炸毁的桥梁。上百的人在一起打桩，发出协同的粗壮有力的呼声。白天，几架美国飞机在这里轰炸了几小时，桥被炸毁两孔，附近弹坑累累。我们路过此桥时，焦木气味依然飘浮在清新的空气中。夜间，农民们集合了几百人，填好弹坑，打起木桩要求最短期间把桥修好。
    我在朝鲜经过许许多多的村庄。村里的儿童听到汽车响，马上跑到街上来，向车上的人高呼“万岁！”。儿童们以为所有坐在汽车上的人都是人民军。因此向他们表示自己最大的敬意。我在朝鲜走过许多的桥梁，桥梁如果是完好的，一定有两三个拿着梭标的农民，在桥上巡逻放哨。他们的任务有两个，一是防止特务的破坏；一是告诉汽车司机，有空袭，或者发生了其他的事情。桥梁如果被炸毁了，那里一定会有许多冒着危险，参加恢复工作的农民。而且他们的劳动完全是义务的，自愿的。
    我在战争的前方吃过许多次“拳头饭”，那是用蒸熟的大米作成的饭团子。有些“拳头饭”的心里还包着砂糖或咸菜。妇女们自愿担任给军队作饭的工作，她们说：这是她们参加战争的最好方法之一。但是，战地村庄的家具很多都被美国人和傀儡军破坏了，找不到饭碗，对于吃饭是很大的困难。于是发明了这种“拳头饭”。这种饭，如果用纸包住，塞进战士们口袋里，携带是很方便的。
    事实上，朝鲜共有两个战场，一在前线，一在后方。美国侵略军在前线上节节败退，他们在那里遭受了朝鲜人民军沉重的打击，最后的胜利无疑地一定属于人民军。但是，美国侵略者残酷万分，从战争开始之初，他们就对于后方和平城市与和平居民用飞机来进行轰炸扫射。朝鲜人民一方面要支援前线的生死斗争，又要对付来自天空的狠毒的袭击，这种负担是相当沉重的。
    在后方，能直接打击敌机的只在防空部队。我怀着最大的敬意访问了两个防空军官。一个是高射炮炮长洪明国。他是个十九岁的精明漂亮的青年。自从战争开始以来，他这门炮打落了十三架美国飞机。有一次，他的高射炮转移到一个新阵地，掩护还未作好，空袭警报就来了。洪明国和战友们一面赶挖工事，一面准备射击。这次的对手是四架美国喷气式飞机，它们从东、北两个方向，用火箭炮和机关枪攻击高射炮阵地。战斗开始后不久，洪明国的战友们纷纷死伤，最后只剩下他一个人了。他说：“在这种紧急时候，最要紧的是沉着。战友们躺在高射炮的旁边，我必须给他们报仇。这时候我只有一个思想——计算敌机的速度，方向和位置。”他的炮是一门好炮，炮身打得热热地，没有发生丝毫故障。他把身上的衣服脱下来，裹住炮身，减少热力，继续射击。他一个人于是兼做弹药手，射击手和观测手。他在这次战斗中打下三架喷气式飞机。
    洪明国是去年七月十五日入伍的。去年他在平壤公立中学毕业，第一天离开校门、第二天进了军营。他说：“那时候我就知道，我的祖国是在危险中，美国人迟早要来打我们的。我选了高射炮这个兵种，日夜学习，准备打击侵略者。我已经打落了一些美国飞机，如果它不离开我国，我要继续打它。”另一位是高射炮中队指挥官崔尚武，指挥四门炮，从战争开始到八月十日，他的炮已经击落了二十架美国飞机。“这种成绩是怎样得来的呢？”我问他，他眉头一瞬，然后说：敌人太残暴了。我的战士们是这样仇恨敌人，火箭炮明明在他们身边炸开了，他们却和没有听见一样。战士们都知道为什么打仗，因此都不怕牺牲，这样的仗就容易打了。当然，我的战士们学习得很好，他们的技术也是不坏的。”
    朝鲜人这种无畏的意志和决心，是从正义的爱国统一战争这个基本地方产生出来的，全世界的正义人士自然都很懂得这个无穷无尽的力量泉源，就是被俘的美国人，也开始认识了这个道理。美国五十三航空中队少尉驾驶员汤姆逊（属美国第七舰队）说：“在朝鲜民主统一的战争中，美国其实是不应该干涉的。据我现在的看法，干涉也白费气力。朝鲜人打仗那样勇敢，他们一定会胜利。”汤姆逊原来是一个具有浓厚的美国式的法西斯思想的人，例如，他说：“我们来朝鲜作战，是奉了联合国的命令。我们美国人，有责任，也有力量，到朝鲜担负警察任务。”现在，他已在俘虏营中住了半个多月。他看了许多事情，听了一些真理，开始有某种程度的改变了。
    “全朝鲜都和美国侵略者作战”已经有了光辉成绩，在这一口号下，美帝国主义必然最后被赶出朝鲜。
