Xinhua News Agency, September 9th—The general trend of national prices continued to remain stable in August. According to the weighted regional index statistics of five categories of commodities—grain, cotton yarn and cloth, non-staple food, fuel, and miscellaneous items—from six major cities (Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and Chongqing), compiled by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government, using December 31 of last year as the base period, the general index on July 31 of this year was 163.8, and on August 31 it was 163.7, a difference of only one-thousandth.

The characteristics of the national price trend in August are firstly, that grain prices in various regions stopped falling and stabilized. New rice was introduced to the market in East China, Central South, and Southwest China, and rice prices once fell slightly in early August. After state-owned grain companies made large-scale purchases from mid-August, prices began to stabilize and gradually rise. In total, the general price index for grains in the six major cities on August 31 decreased by only 5.6% compared to July 31; coarse grain prices in North and Northwest China were also largely similar. Only wheat prices in various regions were lower than the listed prices due to oversupply and the failure of the companies to adjust their listed prices in a timely manner.

Secondly, new cotton has been introduced to the market successively in various regions, but because new grain prices continued to fall, the price difference between cotton and grain widened. The ratio of cotton to grain prices in the cotton-producing areas of North China, Central South, and East China far exceeded the standards stipulated by the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government.

Thirdly, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas during the autumn harvest season has become more active on the basis of the gradual improvement over the past three months. The actual sales volume of yarn, cloth, rice, and flour in various markets has increased significantly. For example, taking the total transaction volume in April as 100, in Shanghai, the August figures were 259.5 for rice, 124.1 for cotton yarn, and 176.1 for cotton cloth. According to the same base period statistics, the August figures in Tianjin were 168.7 for flour, 633.3 for cotton yarn, and 206 for cotton cloth. Other major cities also showed the same trend of increasing activity month by month.

Fourthly, the prices of some imported goods rose in August due to hoarding and speculation by some private merchants.

The current problems with prices in various regions are: although grain prices in various regions have basically stopped falling, the listed prices of rice and coarse grains are still higher than market prices in general areas. New cotton generally has more water and impurities, but its price is even equal to that of old cotton in some areas. Regarding wheat prices, referring to the natural law of wheat-rice conversion in the past, wheat is lower than rice during the wheat harvest season, and about a month after the wheat harvest, the price of wheat begins to be higher than the price of rice. Based on this, current wheat prices in various regions seem to be low. Currently, state-owned trading companies in various regions are actively adjusting cotton prices and striving to make the listed and market prices of rice, wheat, and coarse grains converge at a reasonable level; purchasing new grain and new cotton in large quantities, while organizing a large supply of grain, general merchandise, oil, salt, and local products to farmers, withdrawing currency, and preventing currency from concentrating in one place, which would cause local price fluctuations.

### 八月份全国物价继续保持稳定  国营贸易公司正积极调整粮棉价格

　　八月份全国物价继续保持稳定
    国营贸易公司正积极调整粮棉价格
    【新华社九日讯】八月份全国物价总趋势继续保持稳定。根据中央人民政府贸易部所作的天津、上海、汉口、广州、西安、重庆六大城市的粮食、花纱布、副食品、燃料、杂项五类商品地区加权指数统计，以去年十二月三十一日为基期，今年七月三十一日总指数为一六三点八，八月三十一日为一六三点七，两数相差只千分之一。
    八月份全国物价趋势的特点首先是各地粮价止跌回稳。华东、中南、西南各地新稻上市，上旬米粮价格曾一度下跌。中旬以后经各地国营粮食公司大量收购后即开始趋于稳定，并陆续回升。总计六大城市八月三十一日粮食类价格总指数与七月三十一日相比仅下降百分之五点六；华北、西北各地粗粮价格亦大体与此相似。各地仅小麦因供过于求，加以公司牌价未作及时调整，市价曾低于牌价。
    其次、各地新棉已经先后上市，但因新粮价格续下落，形成棉粮差价扩大现象。华北、中南、华东各产棉区的棉粮比价都远超过中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会所规定的标准。
    第三、秋收季节中城乡物资交流情况已在三个月来逐步好转的基础上愈形活跃。各地市场纱布、米面实销量都有显著增长。如以四月份总成交量为一百，在上海，八月份大米为二五九点五，棉纱为一二四点一，棉布为一七六二点一。以同一基期统计，天津八月份面粉为一六八点七，棉纱为六三三点三，棉布为二零六。其他各大城市也同样呈现逐月活跃的趋势。
    第四、某些进口物资由于某些私商储囤居奇，在八月份价格上涨。
    目前各地物价存在的问题是：各地粮价基本上虽已停止下跌，但一般地区大米及粗粮价格牌价高于市价情况依然存在。新棉一般水杂较多，而其价格在有些地区竟与陈棉相等。麦价方面，参阅历来麦米换算的自然规律是麦收季节麦低于米，麦收一月左右以后，麦价即开始高于米价，据此当前各地麦价即觉偏低。目前各地国营贸易公司正在积极调整棉价，并努力促使大米、小麦及粗粮的牌价、市价在合理的水平上趋于一致；大量收购新粮新棉，同时组织大量粮食、百货、油盐、土产等供应农民，回笼货币，防止货币集中一地，形成局部物价波动。
