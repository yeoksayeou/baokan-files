    The Anti-Imperialist Struggle of Indonesian Youth
    Visiting Indonesian Representative Slamet
    Slamet, the representative of the Indonesian Democratic Youth of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation, spoke frankly to reporters about the heroic struggle of Indonesian youth in opposing imperialist aggression and striving for world peace. Slamet clearly pointed out that the staunch and unyielding struggle waged by Indonesian youth against the American and Dutch imperialists who were invading Indonesia is a part of the world people's struggle for peace.

    Slamet first pointed out that after the Second World War, the aggressive claws of American imperialism also extended into Indonesia, greedily exploiting the blood and sweat of the Indonesian working people, attempting to turn Indonesia into its military base.

    However, today, as oppressed people around the world shatter the chains imposed upon them by imperialism, the Indonesian people have similarly launched a widespread anti-imperialist movement. Slamet said that under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, Indonesian youth, together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and other strata of the people, have formed a People's Democratic Front to fight for the independence and freedom of their motherland. The Indonesian Student Union, uniting 300,000 Indonesian youth and students, and the Indonesian Socialist Youth League are the strong core of this People's Democratic Front. Indonesian youth in the cities frequently hold demonstrations to oppose the rule of American and Dutch imperialism and domestic reactionaries. At the same time, a heroic armed struggle is being waged in the vast rural areas, and a large part of the Indonesian people's armed forces is composed of youth and student teams.

    Another aspect of the struggle is the widespread peace movement launched among the Indonesian people. The Indonesian Student Union, the Indonesian Socialist Youth League, and the Indonesian General Labor Union are actively promoting the peace signature campaign. At present, peace committees have been established in major cities in Indonesia, conveying the call of the world's people for peace to all corners of Indonesia. A vast number of Indonesian people have signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal. The Indonesian people have integrated the struggle against American imperialism with the struggle for world peace.

    Slamet finally excitedly said that the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution has greatly inspired the Indonesian people who are fighting for the independence and freedom of their motherland. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, progressive Indonesian newspapers and periodicals have been vying to publish reports on the construction of the new China and to introduce the revolutionary experience of the Chinese people. Slamet said that the success of the Chinese People's Revolution has pointed out the direction of the Indonesian people's struggle, and the Indonesian youth will stand together with the broad masses of the Indonesian people, forever standing in the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, to fight to the end for lasting world peace and people's democracy.

    印尼青年的反帝斗争
    访问印尼代表斯拉迈特
    世界民主青年联盟代表团的印尼民主青年代表斯拉迈特，对记者畅谈了印尼青年在反对帝国主义侵略、争取世界和平中的英勇斗争。斯拉迈特清楚地指出了印尼青年对侵略印尼的美、荷帝国主义所展开的坚强不屈的斗争，是世界人民争取和平斗争中的一部分。
    斯拉迈特首先指出：在第二次世界大战以后，美帝国主义的侵略魔爪同样地伸入到印尼，贪婪地压榨印尼劳动人民的血汗，企图把印尼变为它的军事基地。
    然而，在世界受压迫的人民纷纷粉碎了帝国主义所加于他们身上的锁链的今天，印尼人民同样展开了广泛的反对帝国主义的运动。斯拉迈特说：印尼的青年在印尼共产党的领导下，和广大的工人、农民及其他阶层的人民，结成了人民民主阵线，为争取祖国的独立、自由而斗争。团结着三十万印尼青年学生的印尼学生联合会和印尼社会主义青年团就是这个人民民主战线的坚强核心。印尼的青年们在城市中经常举行示威游行，反对美、荷帝国主义和国内反动分子的统治。同时，在广大的农村中进行了英勇的武装斗争，印尼的人民武装中间有一大部分是青年学生的队伍。
    斗争的另一面是在印尼人民中间发动了广泛的争取和平运动。印尼学生联合会，印尼社会主义青年团和印尼总工会一道，积极推动了和平签名运动。目前，在印尼的主要城市中都已经成立了拥护和平委员会，把世界人民争取和平的呼声传到印尼的各个角落。极大数目的印尼人民在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言书上签了名。印尼人民已经把反对美帝国主义和争取世界和平的斗争结合在一起。
    斯拉迈特最后兴奋地说：中国人民革命取得了胜利，给予正在为争取祖国的独立、自由而斗争的印尼人民以极大鼓舞。在中华人民共和国成立以后，印尼的进步报刊都纷纷争着刊载新中国的建设情况，介绍中国人民的革命经验。斯拉迈特说：中国人民革命的成功指出了印尼人民斗争的方向，印尼的青年将和广大的印尼人民在一起，永远站在以苏联为首的和平阵营里，为争取世界的持久和平、和人民民主而斗争到底。
