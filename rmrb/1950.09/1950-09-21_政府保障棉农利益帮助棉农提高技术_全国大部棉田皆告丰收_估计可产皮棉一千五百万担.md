Xinhua News Agency, 20th. This year, most cotton fields across the country have reported a bumper harvest. Cotton farmers in various regions have already begun harvesting cotton, and in some areas, new cotton has already been put on the market.

This year, a total of more than 60.25 million mu of cotton fields were sown across the country. Except for more than 4 million mu of cotton fields that suffered reduced yields or were replanted with other crops due to natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and insects, the remaining approximately 56 million mu of cotton fields are laden with bolls, with large cotton bolls, a rare bumper harvest in recent years. In the Hunan region near Dongting Lake and the Luoyang area of Henan Province in the Central South region, each mu of cotton field can yield 30 jin of ginned cotton. In Shandong, Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu and other cotton fields in the East China region, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu is more than 30 jin, an increase of two to three times compared with last year. In the southern Jiangsu region, 370,000 mu of improved cotton seed fields yielded an average of 40 jin of ginned cotton per mu, exceeding the output of general cotton fields this year. In Liaodong Province, the main cotton-producing area in the Northeast, this year's cotton production is about 70% to 80% of normal. Near Shijiazhuang in North China, each mu of cotton field can yield 150 to 200 jin of seed cotton (three jin of seed cotton can be converted into one jin of ginned cotton), and in some areas even 300 to 400 jin. Although southern Shaanxi Province suffered a drought, the cotton harvest is still better than last year, generally about 70% of a normal year. It is estimated that the country can produce about 15 million dan of ginned cotton this year (last year the country produced 8.5 million dan of cotton), an increase of about 75% compared with last year, and thus can overfulfill the glorious task of producing 13.28 million dan of ginned cotton nationwide this year.

The bumper harvest of cotton in various parts of the country this year is due not only to timely and even rainfall and timely sowing, but also and most importantly to the policies adopted by the People's Government to protect the interests of cotton farmers and reward cotton planting. The Central People's Government promptly issued a circular on the ratio between cotton and grain prices, and stipulated that cotton could be used to pay public grain, thus effectively safeguarding the interests of cotton farmers. The leading organs of the major administrative regions also promulgated various measures to reward cotton planting. In some areas, state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies and cooperatives even signed purchase contracts with farmers in advance. These measures effectively eliminated farmers' concerns about cotton planting and greatly increased cotton farmers' enthusiasm for cotton planting. At the same time, the help of national financial and material resources has also played a huge role. This year, the central and local people's governments spent a total of more than 60 million jin of rice on cotton investment, purchasing a large number of insecticides, fertilizers, and seeds, and lending them to cotton farmers. People's governments at all levels also dispatched a large number of technical cadres to guide farmers in cotton planting, effectively helping cotton farmers solve various difficulties in cotton planting. Local people's governments have also planned to allocate and purchase more than 78 million jin of cotton seeds, enabling cotton-producing areas across the country to complete sowing in a timely manner. In addition, the people's governments in various cotton-producing areas have led cotton farmers to carry out timely weeding, pest control, and increased fertilizer application, which is also one of the reasons for ensuring this year's bumper cotton harvest. This year, cotton fields across the country were generally weeded six or seven times, and in some cases up to eight times. At the same time, the amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields in many areas has also increased compared with previous years. Cotton fields that have been hoeed and fertilized are growing vigorously and the seedlings are strong. Local people's governments have also led cotton farmers to vigorously control pests, which has also greatly reduced the degree of harm caused by cotton pests, ensuring this year's bumper cotton harvest.

The new cotton produced nationwide this year, in addition to supplying hand spinning and batting, can also guarantee the annual needs of the 4.2 million spindles currently operating nationwide. New cotton has been put on the market successively in various regions. In order to protect the interests of cotton farmers and adapt to the needs of industry, state-owned cotton yarn and cloth companies in various regions are paying attention to correctly grasping reasonable prices and purchasing large quantities of new cotton.

　　政府保障棉农利益帮助棉农提高技术
    全国大部棉田皆告丰收
    估计可产皮棉一千五百万担
    【新华社二十日讯】今年全国大部棉田皆告丰收，各地棉农现已开始收摘棉花，有些地区新棉且已上市。
    今年全国共播种棉田六千零二十五万余亩，除四百多万亩棉田因遭受水、旱、虫等自然灾害减收或改种其他作物外，其余约有五千六百万亩棉田结桃累累，棉桃硕大，为数年来罕见的丰收。中南区湖南滨洞庭湖地区和河南省洛阳一带棉田，每亩可收皮棉三十市斤。华东区山东、浙江、苏南等地棉田，平均每亩收获皮棉三十市斤以上，比去年增加二倍到三倍。苏南区三十七万亩改良棉种棉田，平均每亩收皮棉达四十斤，超过今年一般棉田产量。东北主要产棉区辽东省今年棉产约达七、八成。华北石家庄附近棉田每亩可摘籽花（三斤籽花可折皮棉一斤）一百五十斤至二百斤，个别地区且达三、四百斤。陕西省南部虽遭旱灾，但棉花收成仍较去年为好，一般约有七成年景。据估计，今年全国可产皮棉一千五百万担左右（去年全国产棉八百五十万担），较去年增产百分之七十五左右，因而可超额地完成今年全国生产一千三百二十八万担的皮棉的光荣任务。
    全国各地今年棉花获得丰收，除雨水调匀、播种适时以外，最重要的原因是人民政府采取了保护棉农利益和奖励植棉的政策。中央人民政府曾及时地发布了棉粮比价的通告，并曾规定棉花可代缴公粮，因而切实有效地保障了棉农的利益。各大行政区领导机关也颁布了奖励植棉的各项办法。有些地区的国营花纱布公司和合作社更预先与农民订立购花合同。这些措施都有效地消除了农民对植棉的顾虑，大大提高了棉农的植棉情绪。同时国家财力物力的帮助也起了极大的作用，今年中央和各级人民政府共支出棉花投资米计达六千余万斤，购买大批杀虫药械、肥料、种籽，贷放给棉农。各级人民政府并派遣大批技术干部指导农民种棉，有力地帮助棉农解决种棉时的各种困难。各地人民政府还有计划地调剂和购买了棉种达七千八百余万斤，使全国各产棉区能够适时地完成播种。此外，各产棉区人民政府领导棉农及时进行锄草、除虫和增施肥料，也是保证今年棉花丰收的原因之一。今年全国各地棉田普遍锄了六、七遍草，多者达到八遍，同时，很多地区棉田的施肥量亦比往年增加，经锄苗和施肥的棉田，生长旺盛，苗棵茁壮。各地人民政府并领导棉农大力防治虫害，也大大减轻了棉虫的为害程度，保证了今年棉花的丰收。
    今年全国所产新棉，除供给手纺和胎絮之用外，并可保证全国现在运转着的四百二十万枚纱锭一年之需。现各地新棉已陆续上市。为保障棉农利益和适应工业需要，各地国营花纱布公司正在注意正确地掌握合理价格，大量地收购新棉。
