　　Henan Summer Grain Tax Storage Nears Completion; Cadre Training and Thorough Preparations Made Before Storage
　　[This Newspaper Despatch] The summer grain tax collection in most areas of Henan Province began to be stored in early July. With the exception of the Huangchuan and Xinyang regions, the remaining regions successively completed this glorious storage task between the end of July and mid-August, with the stored grain accounting for 96 percent of the target.
　　Before the grain was stored, all regions and counties conducted training for warehouse cadres, improving their political and professional levels and establishing a correct understanding of warehouse work. For example, Zhao Huayun, an inspector at the Liuhe Warehouse in Ningling County, refused to accept substandard grain submitted by his uncle. Although his uncle scolded him severely, he explained, "This is public grain, and I cannot accept such grain." He adhered to the principle that grain that is not dry, clean, and good will not be accepted.
　　Sufficient preparations were also made before storage. In June, grain depots in various regions began to carry out warehouse cleaning and consolidation, as well as necessary repairs to warehouses and the purchase of various equipment. In addition, tea and water refreshment stations were set up, and doctors and veterinarians were mobilized and organized to establish medical stations. Because the peasants personally experienced that the People's Government was always working for them, their enthusiasm for delivering grain was very high, and they ensured that the grain delivered was dry, clean, and of good quality. Generally speaking, the quality of this year's grain has improved compared to previous years.

　　河南夏征粮入库接近完成
    入库前进行了干部整训并作了充分准备工作
    【本报讯】河南省大部地区夏征粮食已于七月上旬开始入库，除潢川、信阳两专区外，其余各专区均于七月底到八月中旬先后完成这一光荣入库任务，入库粮食占任务百分之九十六。
    在粮食入库前，各专、县均进行了仓库干部的整训，提高了干部的政治与业务水平，树立起对仓库工作的正确认识。如宁陵县柳河仓库检查员赵华云拒绝收下他舅舅缴的不合标准的粮食，虽挨他舅舅大骂，仍解释说：“这是公粮，我不能收这等粮食。”坚持了粮食不干不净不收的原则。
    入库前并做了较充分的准备工作。在六月间各地粮库就展开了清仓与并仓工作，并进行了库房的必要修补及各项器材的购置。此外，还设立了茶水招待站，并动员、组织了医生和兽医成立医疗站。由于农民亲身体验到人民政府时刻在为自己办事，所以交粮情绪非常高，并且做到交的粮干、净、好。一般说来，今年的粮质较往年是提高了一步。
