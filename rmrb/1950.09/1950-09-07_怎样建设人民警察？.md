The National Public Security Administrative Conference convened by the Ministry of Public Security of the Central People's Government has concluded. This conference summarized many important experiences in national public security administrative work over the past year, defined the responsibilities of public security administrative departments, and put forward future work tasks. Among them, the issue of building the people's police should arouse our universal attention.

The people's police are one of the main tools of our people's democratic dictatorship. "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China, namely the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the People's Police, belong to the people's armed forces. Their task is to defend China's independence and the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, to protect the revolutionary achievements and all legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese people." This is stipulated in Article 10 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This means that the task of the people's police is, on the one hand, to resolutely suppress and control all enemies of the people, effectively eliminate bandits, secret agents, and thieves, and maintain social order; on the other hand, to always care about the interests of the people, protect all legitimate rights and interests of the people, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Suppressing enemies and protecting the people, exercising dictatorship over enemies and practicing democracy within the people, are two aspects of a unified task.

From this, it can be seen that the Chinese people, who have just won a nationwide victory, should not weaken the people's police, who suppress enemies and protect themselves, but should strengthen them a hundredfold through various efforts. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Our current task is to strengthen the state apparatus of the people, which mainly refers to the people's army, the people's police, and the people's courts, in order to protect national defense and the interests of the people. This will enable China to steadily advance from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a new democratic society to a socialist and communist society, to eliminate classes and achieve great harmony under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party. The state apparatus such as the army, police, and courts are tools for class oppression. For hostile classes, it is a tool of oppression, it is violence, and it is not something 'benevolent'." Lenin also repeatedly taught us in "The State and Revolution": "The standing army and the police are the main tools of state power."

However, the state apparatus of the reactionary ruling classes in the past was used to oppress and enslave the broad masses of the people. The reactionary police organs had long enslaved and suppressed the people, and their evil deeds aroused great hatred among the people. We, the Chinese people, have also suffered a lot of abuse and oppression from the reactionary police in the past. Due to this objective historical reason, there has arisen among the masses, and even among many of our cadres, a serious blurring of the distinction between the people's police and the reactionary police, or equating them, mistakenly believing that the people's police are also not glorious. They do not understand that the people's police serve the broad masses of all revolutionary classes and protect the interests of the majority of the people; therefore, it is essentially different from the reactionary police in the past who only served a few reactionary rulers and oppressed the broad masses of the people, and therefore the system and style of the people's police are also fundamentally different from the reactionary police. In the past year, public security departments at all levels have not paid enough attention to the work of building the people's police, and have achieved very little, because public security cadres at all levels do not have a very clear understanding of the nature and importance of the people's police. In order to smoothly carry out the construction of the people's police, it is necessary to correctly understand the important role of the people's police in the people's state power and to eliminate all kinds of misconceptions about the people's police.

Building a police force that truly serves the people is still an extremely arduous task. The National Public Security Conference has determined the guiding principles and plans for the construction of the people's police, that is, on the one hand, to strengthen leadership and education for the existing people's police; on the other hand, to cultivate backbones and supplement necessary fresh blood to strive to establish a people's police force with high political awareness and familiarity with business within two or three years (about two years for old areas, and roughly three years for semi-old areas and new areas). This guideline and plan are correct. We should make every effort to achieve it. There are three keys to achieving this: first, rectifying the organization; second, education and training; and third, mass supervision. Each region should strive to achieve this in a planned and focused manner according to the specific circumstances and the different development of work.

Judging from the current organizational situation of the police, it is still not healthy enough, and there is still a distance from the standard of a true people's police. A true people's police should have the awareness to serve the people wholeheartedly in politics, and be pure in organization and style. Therefore, to build a true people's police, the first decisive key is to rectify the organization. First of all, it is very necessary to infuse enough fresh blood into the ranks of the people's police. Only by infusing enough fresh blood and having a strong backbone can the old be thoroughly transformed, and new forces can fully grow, and a people's police that lives up to its name can truly emerge. Only such a true people's police is a reliable force for defending national security, protecting the interests of the people, and suppressing counter-revolutionaries. For this purpose, a group of outstanding elements from urban workers and revolutionary intellectuals should be transferred to the ranks of the people's police in a planned and step-by-step manner, striving to reach a certain proportion of these components within two or three years, so that the existing people's police can be sufficiently supplemented and further transformed in terms of organizational composition. This is a necessary condition and a decisive condition. Only with this fundamental condition can the thorough transformation of the retained old police be better realized.

According to statistics, there are currently about 80,000 police officers nationwide. Among them, except for some cities in Northeast China that were liberated earlier, the retained old police generally account for more than 60% of the existing police in other regions. After the reactionary regime of the Kuomintang was overthrown, a large part of the old police personnel turned to the people's side, joined the ranks of the people's police, and after a certain period of education and transformation, under the leadership of people's public security organs at all levels and under the supervision of the broad masses of the people, played a certain role in maintaining urban social order, and it should be admitted that this is their contribution. This also shows that the policy adopted by the People's Government of retaining them and educating and transforming them is correct and necessary. Experience has proved that many of them can be thoroughly transformed through education and can stand on the people's position and serve the people well. However, since the old police had been influenced by the reactionary class for a long time, and had consciously or unconsciously served the interests of the reactionary class for a long time and opposed the people, there were indeed serious problems in their politics, ideology, and style. For example, bad behaviors such as extortion and blackmail, corruption and degeneration, deeply rooted mercenary concepts, difficulty in absorbing new things ideologically, and difficulty in truly approaching the people politically have not been fundamentally overcome. It is wrong to lump together and one-sidedly think that the retained old police are all good, or all bad, and to take inappropriate handling methods based on these one-sided views. Our policy of education and transformation is clear and firm. Except for individual counter-revolutionary elements hidden in the people's police, and those who hold stubborn reactionary ideas and a strong Kuomintang style, and still do not change after repeated education, in general, we should work hard on all old police who can be educated and transformed, strive for them, and encourage them to serve the people wholeheartedly. The achievements of various places in transforming the old police in the past year should be re-evaluated correctly and comprehensively. Pessimism, disappointment, and complacency are all wrong; simply playing with statistical figures cannot explain the essence of the problem. Now the retained old police, as long as they are determined to continue to transform themselves, thoroughly eliminate bad habits, cultivate a new style of hard struggle and loyal service to the people, and prove in practice before the people that they have indeed transformed, we should all welcome them.

The second decisive key to building the people's police is to strengthen the education and training of the people's police. In particular, in the future, all new members of the people's police should be given extensive education on policies and business. Some places in the Northeast that have already changed in composition should make every effort to carry out this education so that they can truly master policies and be familiar with business, and should also specifically train a certain number of cadres as the backbone of the people's police. The Ministry of Public Security of the Central Government, the public security departments of major administrative regions and directly-controlled municipalities should all run a school for training police officers and police cadres within the next two years, to train middle and lower-level police cadres and new police officers separately, in order to supplement the people's police and their backbone elements within their respective jurisdictions, and to first enrich and strengthen the police stations of urban public security grassroots organizations. For all old police officers, education and transformation should be carried out without exception through rotation training classes or selecting them for study; in particular, emphasis should be placed on revolutionary political education and ideological transformation education, in order to strive for them to achieve a truly thorough transformation in ideology and style as much and as quickly as possible. At the same time, discipline education for the people's police is also very necessary. They should be educated and trained with the working rules and reward and punishment regulations of the people's police, modeled on the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention of the People's Liberation Army, so that they can truly become people's police who deeply hate the enemies of the people, cherish the masses of the people, and loyally serve the people.

The third decisive key to building the people's police is to widely implement mass supervision. The people's police have the most direct and frequent contact with the people. For example, the public security police stations in cities are not only responsible for enforcing public security laws and regulations, but also for doing a good job in household registration, managing household registrations, and carrying out the elimination of secret agents and bandits and fire prevention. Police stations cannot but care about the implementation of all government laws and regulations, and care about all issues related to the interests of the people. This direct and frequent daily relationship with the people provides opportunities for bad elements in the police to do evil; but for all police officers who are loyal to the people, it is an opportunity to serve the people at all times. To expose bad people and bad deeds, and to reward good people and good deeds, in addition to in-depth inspection and supervision by leaders, the most important thing is to rely on the supervision of the broad masses of the people. At certain meetings of people's representatives from all walks of life and people's organizations, good and bad police officers and their good and bad styles can and should be commended and reported. Marx mentioned in "The Civil War in France" that one of the experiences of the "Paris Commune" was to transform the police "into responsible and always revocable organs of the Commune." Since our people's police should be placed under the supervision of the people, then the people should also be able to "revoke" bad police officers at any time. Only under the close supervision of the masses can a police force that truly serves the people be built.

In addition, the treatment of the people's police should still be in accordance with the regulations for different levels. The salary of the lowest-level police officer is generally equivalent to the standard of supporting one and a half people; each higher level increases the salary by one percent. Those below this standard should be brought up to this standard, but it is inappropriate to demand salaries exceeding this standard at present (the original political and material treatment of personnel selected and transferred from the People's Liberation Army and enterprises should not be reduced). For some welfare issues of the people's police, various places should properly resolve them under the principle of ensuring the work and life of the people's police and taking into account the country's financial difficulties. Pensions for police officers injured or killed should also be implemented in accordance with regulations.

After this National Public Security Conference, all localities should earnestly pay attention to the arduous work of building the people's police. We must ensure that the people's police, which is related to the broad masses of the people and moves like blood vessels in the body of our people's country, is filled with fresh revolutionary blood; we must build it into a people's police force that is pure in politics, organization, and style, proficient in business, and wholeheartedly serves the people, in accordance with the standards required by the Common Program.

### 怎样建设人民警察？

　　怎样建设人民警察？
    中央人民政府公安部所召开的全国首次治安行政会议业已闭幕。这个会议总结了一年来全国治安行政工作的许多重要经验，确定了治安行政部门的工作职责，提出了今后的工作任务。其中，关于人民警察的建设问题，应该引起我们普遍的重视。
    人民警察是我们人民民主专政的国家政权的主要工具之一。“中华人民共和国的武装力量，即人民解放军、人民公安部队和人民警察，是属于人民的武力。其任务为保卫中国的独立和领土主权的完整，保卫中国人民的革命成果和一切合法权益。”这是人民政协共同纲领第十条的规定。这就是说，人民警察的任务是一方面坚决镇压与管制一切人民的敌人，有效地肃清土匪、特务和窃盗，维护社会治安；一方面时刻关心人民群众的利益，保护人民的一切合法权益，全心全意为人民服务。镇压敌人和保护人民，对敌人实行专政和在人民内部实行民主，这是一个统一的任务的两个方面。
    由此可见，刚刚取得全国规模胜利的中国人民对于镇压敌人、保护自己的人民警察，不但不应该使它软弱无力，而且应该通过各种努力，使它百倍地加强起来。毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”中曾明确地指出：“我们现在的任务是要强化人民的国家机器，这主要地是指人民的军队，人民的警察和人民的法庭，借以保护国防和保护人民利益。以此作为条件，使中国有可能在工人阶级及共产党的领导之下稳步地由农业国进到工业国，由新民主主义社会进到社会主义社会与共产主义社会，消灭阶级和实现大同。军队、警察、法庭等项国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”列宁在“国家与革命”中也曾一再教导我们：“常备军和警察是国家权力的主要工具。”
    但是，过去反动统治阶级的国家机器是用以压迫与奴役广大人民的。反动的警察机关长期奴役与镇压人民，它们的罪恶行为激起了人民极大的憎恨。我们中国人民，过去也受了反动警察的很多凌虐与压迫。由于这种客观的历史原因，就产生了在群众中，甚至于在我们不少的干部中也严重地存在着对于人民警察和反动警察混淆不清或相提并论的模糊观念，错误地认为人民警察也是不光荣的。他们不懂得人民警察是为各个革命阶级的广大人民服务的，是为保护大多数人民利益的；因而它和过去只为少数反动统治者服务、压迫广大人民的反动警察有本质的不同，因而人民警察的制度和作风也与反动警察根本不同。过去一年以来，各级公安部门对于建设人民警察的工作重视不够，成绩还很少，就都因为各级公安干部对于人民警察的性质及其重要性认识得不很清楚。为了顺利进行人民警察的建设工作，正确认识人民警察在人民国家政权中的重要作用，清除各种各样的对人民警察的错误看法，是十分必要的。
    要建设真正为人民服务的警察，还是一件极艰苦的工作。这次全国治安会议确定了人民警察的建设方针和计划，即是一方面对于现有的人民警察加强领导，加强教育；一方面培养骨干，补充必要的新鲜血液，来争取在两三年时间内（老区争取在两年左右，半老区及新区则大体在三年左右），建立一支有高度政治觉悟的和熟悉业务的人民警察队伍。这个方针和计划是正确的。我们应该用一切努力来实现它。实现的关键有三个：一是整顿组织；二是教育训练；三是群众监督。各地区应该根据具体情况和工作发展的不同，有计划有重点地求其实现。
    从现有的警察的组织情况看来，它还是不够健康的，离开真正的人民警察的标准还有一段距离。真正的人民警察应该是在政治上有全心全意为人民服务的觉悟，在组织和作风上都是纯洁的。因此，要建设真正的人民警察，第一个决定的关键就是整顿组织。首先要灌输足够的新鲜血液到人民警察的队伍中去，这是非常必要的。只有灌输了足够的新鲜血液，有了坚强的骨干，旧的也才能够得到彻底的改造，新的力量才能够充分地生长起来，名符其实的人民警察才能够真正地出现。也只有这样真正的人民警察，才是保卫国家安全、保卫人民利益、镇压反革命的可靠力量。为了这个目的，就应该有计划、有步骤地征调一批城市工人、革命知识分子中的优秀分子到人民警察的队伍中去，争取在两三年内使这些成份达到一定的比例，使现有的人民警察，从组织成份上得到足够的补充和进一步的改造。这是一个必要的条件，也是一个带决定性的条件。有了这个根本条件，也才能够更好地实现对于留用的旧警察的彻底改造工作。
    据统计，全国现有八万左右的警察。其中，除东北解放较早的若干城市以外，在其他各地现有的警察中，留用的旧警察一般地占了百分之六十以上。在国民党反动政权被推翻以后，旧有的警察人员，有很大部分转到了人民方面来，加入了人民警察的队伍，经过了一定的教育和改造，在各级人民公安机关的领导下，在广大人民的监督下，对于维护城市社会治安起了一定作用，应该承认这是他们的功劳。这也说明了人民政府采取留用他们并加以教育改造的政策是正确的和必要的。经验证明，他们中有许多都是可以经过教育得到彻底改造，并能站在人民的立场上很好为人民服务的。但是，由于旧警察曾长期受着反动阶级的影响，长期自觉或不自觉地为反动阶级利益服务，同人民对立，因而他们在政治上、思想上、作风上就确实存在着严重的问题。例如勒索敲诈、贪污腐化等恶劣行为，根深蒂固的雇佣观念，思想上不容易吸收新鲜事物，政治上不容易真正靠近人民等等缺点，都还没有根本被克服。笼统地片面地认为留用的旧警察都是好的，或者都是坏的，并根据这些片面看法而采取不适当的处理办法，是错误的。我们教育改造的方针是明确的和坚定的，除了个别隐蔽在人民警察中的反革命分子，以及抱着顽固的反动思想和浓厚的国民党作风，经过再三教育仍旧不改的分子以外，一般地说，我们对于一切可以教育改造的旧警察都要用心地向他们进行工作，都要争取他们，鼓励他们全心全意为人民服务。过去一年来各地改造旧警察的成绩，应重新加以正确的全面的估计。悲观失望和麻痹自满都是不对的；单纯的摆弄统计数字也不能说明问题的本质。现在留用的旧警察，只要他们决心继续改造自己，彻底肃清坏的作风，养成艰苦奋斗、忠心服务人民的新作风，用实际行动在人民面前证明确已转变了的，我们都应该欢迎他们。
    建设人民警察的第二个决定的关键，是加强人民警察的教育训练工作。特别是今后对于人民警察中的一切新成份，都应该进行广泛的政策与业务的教育。东北有些已经在成份上有了改变的地方，更应全力进行这种教育，使他们真正能够掌握政策，熟悉业务，并且要专门培养一定数量的干部作为人民警察的骨干。中央公安部、各大行政区和中央直辖市的公安部门，在今明两年内都应该办好一个培养警察和警察干部的学校，分别培养中下级警察干部和新警察，以便补充所属范围内的人民警察及其骨干分子，并首先充实与加强城市公安基层组织的派出所。对于一切旧警察，应该无例外地采取轮训班或选调他们学习的方式，进行教育改造；尤其要着重进行革命的政治教育与思想改造的教育，以争取他们尽可能更多更快地在思想上、作风上有真正彻底的转变。同时，人民警察的纪律教育也是非常必要的。应该仿照人民解放军的三大纪律、八项注意的办法，用人民警察的工作守则及奖惩条例来教育他们，训练他们，使他们真正成为对人民的敌人深恶痛绝、对人民群众爱护备至、忠心为人民服务的人民警察。
    建设人民警察的第三个决定的关键，就是要广泛实行群众的监督。人民警察和人民群众有着最直接的、最频繁的接触。如城市中的公安派出所，不但要负责执行治安法令，而且要做好户籍工作，管理户口，进行清除特务盗匪及防火等工作。派出所不能不关心政府一切法令的执行，关心与人民群众利益有关的一切问题。与人民群众的这种直接的频繁的日常关系，对于警察中的坏分子，固然有便于为非作恶的机会；但对于一切忠于人民的警察，则是时时刻刻为人民服务的机会。要揭发坏人坏事，奖励好人好事，除了领导上的深入检查与督促以外，最主要的就是要依靠广大人民群众的监督。在各界人民代表会议和人民团体的某些会议上，都可以也应该表扬与检举好坏警察和他们的好坏作风。马克思在《法兰西内战》一书中提到“巴黎公社”的经验之一，就是把警察“变为公社的负责的随时可以撤换的机关”。我们的人民警察，既然应该被放到人民的监督之下，那末，人民也应该“随时可以撤换”坏的警察。只有在人民群众的密切监督之下，才能够建设真正为人民服务的警察。
    此外，人民警察的待遇仍然应该按照分别等级的规定，最低级警察的薪给，一般地相当于养活一个半人的标准；每高一级提高薪给百分之一。低于这个标准的应该使之达到这个标准，但在目前如果要求超过这个标准的薪给则是不适当的（从解放军中和企业中选调出来的人员，其原来的政治待遇和物质待遇应该不被降低）。对于人民警察的若干福利问题，各地在保障人民警察的工作与生活的原则下，在照顾国家财政困难的条件下，应该予以适当解决。对警察伤亡的抚恤亦应照章实行。
    经过这一次全国治安会议之后，各地应该切实注意建设人民警察这个艰巨的工作。我们一定要使关系着广大人民群众的、像血管一样在我们人民国家的机体中活动的人民警察，充满着新鲜的革命血液；一定要按照共同纲领所要求的标准，把它建设成为一支在政治上、组织上和作风上纯洁的、在业务上熟练的、忠心耿耿地为人民服务的人民警察队伍。
