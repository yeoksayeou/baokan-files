Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th: "Izvestia" and "Pravda" published articles by Afonin and Vasilyev respectively, discussing how U.S. imperialism is intensifying fascistization at home and in satellite countries to coordinate with its plan to expand the war. Afonin pointed out that Wall Street big capitalists and their servants in the government are actively creating an atmosphere of terror and war hysteria in the United States, attempting to stifle the people's mass movement and accelerate the shift of the U.S. economy and national life to a wartime system. The American ruling group fears that their expansionist and military adventure policies will inevitably lead to increased popular protests, so they are taking urgent steps to "consolidate the rear."

The longer the U.S. imperialist adventure in Korea drags on, the more popular dissatisfaction grows. The defeats of the American army in Korea, the prospect of a continued decline in the U.S. living standards—all of these are affecting the mood of ordinary Americans. Therefore, since the beginning of the Korean incident, Congress has discussed many repressive bills. The reactionaries are attempting to focus on attacking the working class and its vanguard—the Communist Party. Afonin pointed out that from June 25 to August 1, more than 200 people have been arrested in the United States for "political reasons." State authorities, emulating the federal government, are also not lagging behind in fanatically spreading the plague of reaction and barbarism, persecuting progressive leaders. Recently, attempts to strengthen fascist organizations have become increasingly blatant. The activities of the Ku Klux Klan are gradually being revived.

Afonin emphasized that the madness of the reactionary forces in the United States is not proof of the strength of the warmongers, but proof of their weakness. The growth of the peace movement, the large number of open refusals to enlist in the army, the failure of the plan to recruit volunteers to participate in the Korean War—these are only a few signs that millions of ordinary American people are increasingly dissatisfied with the adventurous policies of the ruling class at home.

Vasilyev pointed out that the U.S. government is driving its satellite countries down the same path. Truman has announced that he will carry out an anti-communist movement in all Marshall Plan countries. The French government has recently arrested and deported hundreds of democratic anti-fascists, including Spanish Republicans, as well as citizens of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the Soviet Union residing in France. The Belgian government, which protects the murderers of Lahaut, leader of the Belgian Communist Party, has decided to purge Communists and their sympathizers from government agencies. Britain and Switzerland are also taking similar despicable measures. Anti-communist hysteria is being incited in Italy, Denmark, Sweden, and other Marshall Plan countries.

Vasilyev stressed that the fascist movements of Western European governments illustrate the instability of their positions in their own countries, and they are therefore attempting to maintain their regimes by means of terror. The masses of the people are giving a strong rebuff to the reactionary forces' attempts to revive fascism. The recent provocations by the French authorities have aroused a wave of indignation both inside and outside France. In Britain, Italy, Norway, Switzerland, and other countries, the working people are responding to the fascist measures taken by the governments with rallies, demonstrations, and protest strikes. The democratic forces of all countries are increasingly uniting in the struggle against the reactionaries.

    美帝配合其扩大侵略战争计划  在国内及仆从国加紧法西斯化
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报及真理报分别刊载了阿福宁及瓦西里耶夫的文章，论述美帝国主义为配合其扩大战争的计划而在本国及仆从国家加紧法西斯化。阿福宁指出：华尔街大企业家们及其在政府中的从仆们，正积极地在美国制造恐怖气氛与战争歇斯底里，企图以此来扼杀人民的群众运动，以加速把美国经济与全国生活推上战时体制。美国的统治集团害怕他们的扩张与军事冒险政策不可避免地会引起人民抗议的增长，便采取紧急步骤来“巩固后方”。
    美帝国主义在朝鲜的冒险行为拖延得愈久，人民的不满就愈多。美国军队在朝鲜的失败、美国生活水准的继续下降的远景——所有这些都影响了美国普通老百姓的情绪。因此，自朝鲜事件开始以来，国会已讨论了许多镇压性的法案。反动派的企图是要着重打击工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党。阿福宁指出：从六月二十五日至八月一日止，在美国已以“政治理由”逮捕了二百多人。各州当局效法联邦政府的榜样，在狂热地散布反动和野蛮的瘟疫，迫害进步领袖方面也不甘落后。最近，加强法西斯组织的企图日益嚣张。三Ｋ党的活动逐渐复活起来。
    阿福宁强调称：美国反动势力的发疯不是证明战争贩子有力量，而是证明他们的孱弱。和平运动的增长，大批公开拒绝参军的事件，征募参加朝鲜战争的志愿兵的计划的失败——这些只是说明千百万普通美国人民日益不满国内统治阶级的冒险政策的少数迹象而已。
    瓦西里耶夫指出美国政府正驱使其卫星国家走上同样的道路。杜鲁门已宣布要在所有马歇尔化国家中进行反共运动。法国政府近来已将数百民主反法西斯分子加以逮捕和驱逐出境，他们是在法国居住的西班牙共和分子以及波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、苏联的公民。庇护谋杀比利时共产党领袖拉豪特的凶手的比利时政府，已决定自政府机构中清除共产党人和他们的同情者。英国与瑞士也正采取同样卑劣的措施。意大利、丹麦、瑞典及其他马歇尔化国家中正在煽动反共的歇斯底里。
    瓦西里耶夫着重指出：西欧各国政府的法西斯运动，说明了它们在本国地位的不稳固，他们因此企图以恐怖手段来保持政权。人民群众给反动力量复活法西斯主义的企图以强有力的反击。法国当局最近进行的挑衅，曾在法国国内外引起了愤慨的浪潮。在英国、意大利、挪威、瑞士及其他国家中，劳动人民以集会、游行示威、抗议罢工，来回答各国政府所采取的法西斯措施。一切国家的民主力量在反对反动派的斗争中日益团结起来了。
