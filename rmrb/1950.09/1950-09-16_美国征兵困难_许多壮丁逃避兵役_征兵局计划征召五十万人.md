Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 15th: TASS, Washington, 14th - The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee released a report made by Major General Hershey, director of the Selective Service System, at a secret meeting of the committee on September 1st. Hershey declared that the government plans to conscript 370,000 to 500,000 men into the military before July 1, 1951. Hershey requested approval of supplementary appropriations for the use of the Selective Service agencies.

Many facts show that a high percentage of conscripted men are trying to evade military service. For example, according to Colonel Cober, director of the New York City Selective Service Office, 22 percent of those called for Selective Service physical examinations did not report on September 12. On September 11, the Selective Service authorities reported the names of 160 people, supposedly "deliberate offenders," to the FBI and asked the FBI to arrest them. If they cannot explain the reason for not reporting, they will be prosecuted. According to New York newspapers, a World War II veteran, when conscripted for active duty, injured himself in the officer's office and said, "The army will not be able to make me a soldier again."

　　美国征兵困难
    许多壮丁逃避兵役
    征兵局计划征召五十万人
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十四日讯：美国参议院拨款委员会发表了征兵局局长赫希少将九月一日在该委员会秘密会议上所作的报告，赫希宣称政府已计划在一九五一年七月一日以前征召三十七万到五十万人参军，赫希要求批准补充拨款，以备征兵机构之用。
    许多事实显示，百分比很高的被征壮丁试图逃避兵役。例如，据纽约市征兵处处长科伯上校报告，被召受征兵体格检查的人，有百分之二十二在九月十二日未报到，征兵当局在九月十一日将据说是“故意犯法”的一百六十人的姓名报告了联邦调查局，请联邦调查局加以逮捕。如果他们不能解释不报到的理由，就要对他们提起公诉。据纽约报纸报道，第二次世界大战的一个退伍军人于被征参加现役时，在军官的办公室中自己毁伤了身体，并说：“陆军将再不能让我当兵了。”
