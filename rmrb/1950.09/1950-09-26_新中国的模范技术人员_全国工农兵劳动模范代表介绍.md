Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: Model technicians who are making outstanding contributions to the construction of the motherland are emerging in batches in the people's New China. The knowledge and talents of these technicians, combined with the labor experience of the broad masses of workers and peasants, are powerfully driving forward the productive forces of New China. Many of the representatives selected to attend this National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers are such new-type technicians.

In the power sector, Yu Songru, an engineer in the Power Department of Tianjin China Textile Construction Company No. 1 Factory, applied the latest scientific theories to改造 [remodel/transform] old boilers, significantly improving their efficiency while greatly saving coal. His creative work provides the best example for technicians on how to improve production under existing conditions. In August, the factory's chain furnace consumed only 0.682 kilograms of coal per kilowatt-hour, 43 percent lower than the factory's lowest coal consumption in April 1947. As a result, the factory saved more than 2,600 tons of coal from January to July this year. Currently, his coal-saving method is being widely promoted in Tianjin and has achieved considerable results.

Zhang Deqing, head and chief engineer of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company's Mechanical Department, noting that fuel gasoline needs to be purchased from abroad, painstakingly researched and created the fifth-style comprehensive white coal furnace, converting gasoline vehicles into white coal vehicles. Cars equipped with the white coal furnace neither damage the original parts nor differ from gasoline vehicles in performance. The price of white coal is only one-seventh that of gasoline, saving the transportation company 2.2 billion yuan in fuel costs each month and saving the country foreign exchange.

In the telecommunications sector, the "crossovers" of China's long-distance telephone lines were all designed by foreigners in the past, mechanically copying the American "crossovers," resulting in significant crosstalk and wasted materials. Hou Deyuan, Deputy Director and Engineer of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau, after painstaking research, designed a set of "Type 88 Line Crossovers" suitable for Chinese materials. By using this "crossover," each pair of lines can carry three carrier telephone circuits, so the wires on a single telephone pole can allow ninety-six people to speak simultaneously without interference. This "crossover" not only reduces crosstalk and maintains secrecy but also saves materials. By adopting this "crossover," the country saved the equivalent of over 947,000 catties of millet in steel plates alone this year.

To improve China's productivity, improving agricultural farming methods is very important. However, in the past, China's machinery manufacturing industry rarely improved agricultural tools for farmers. Liu Dianyu, Deputy Technician of the Hubei Mechanical Reclamation Office's Machine Manufacturing Plant, designed and manufactured a set of new agricultural tools from plowing to harvesting in just seven months this year. These include a single-sided light plow, animal-powered spring harrow, five-row seeder, animal-powered five-tooth cultivator and weeder, animal-powered harvester, dragon-bone waterwheel, and other nine types. These agricultural tools have all been tested on farms and have excellent efficiency. For example, the production efficiency of the five-row seeder is five times higher than that of the old type.

In Yumen Oilfield—a Gobi Desert that many people believe cannot produce miracles—the young Assistant Engineer Wang Yuecai created a miracle. He created a DC amplifier, an electrical measuring instrument used to measure oil wells. This instrument can accurately measure the nature of the formation and the depth of the oil layer, overcoming the inaccurate shortcomings of the American electrical measuring instrument originally used by the oilfield. Thanks to his creation, Yumen Oilfield has safely drilled seven oil wells.

In New China, there are many other outstanding technicians who have made great contributions to the people, in addition to those mentioned above. For example, Sun Zhaosen, an engineer at Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant, and Zhao Naibin, an engineer at Tangshan Steel Plant, are both good representatives.

These technicians were generally not valued or even were excluded during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. Therefore, in Old China, their work enthusiasm was not brought into play, and their knowledge and skills were not fully utilized. For example, when Liu Dianyu worked in the Agriculture Rehabilitation Committee of the Kuomintang government's Relief Administration, he often made suggestions to the person in charge for improving agricultural tools, but the answer he received was: "If we want to do it, we will ask Americans to come. What can you do!?" For example, Zhang Deqing once served as the director of the Shanghai Public Transportation Company's automobile repair and manufacturing plant during the Kuomintang rule but resigned and left due to constant humiliation and exclusion. However, in New China, they have received attention and encouragement, and they have obtained the opportunity to serve the motherland and the people. For example, Zhang Deqing was invited back to serve as the head of the Mechanical Department after the liberation of Shanghai by the transportation company. For example, Hou Deyuan, due to his expertise in telecommunications transmission, was first invited to serve as the head of the First Division of the Engineering Department when the East China Telecommunications Administration was established, then transferred by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications of the Central People's Government to serve as the Deputy Director of the Technical Department of the Telecommunications Bureau, and then promoted to the current position of Deputy Director of the Long-Distance Telecommunications Bureau. This past March, the National Long-Distance Telecommunications Engineering Conference decided that his "crossover" should be adopted nationwide. The government issued him a bonus of 4,000 catties of rice in July. Due to the attention and encouragement from the state, and because they have gradually realized and felt from personal experience that they are indeed the masters of New China, members of the working class, and should wholeheartedly serve the people, their work attitudes have undergone significant changes. Yu Songru, who refused to repair the turbine even when invited before liberation, automatically suggested to the administrative person in charge three times in a row that he was willing to undertake the work of repairing the turbine. Zhang Deqing, who was enjoying higher treatment at Texaco Foreign Company, happily returned to the transportation company. Their work enthusiasm is so high and their creative desires are so strong in New China that Liu Dianyu sat in the office for four days and nights to painstakingly study the design of the seeder during the Spring Festival, while others went home for family reunions. Although the problem was very complicated, Hou Deyuan's "Type 88 Line Crossover" was completed in his spare time. Ma Shuren, an engineer at the Chahar Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, personally went into the bone-chilling water to direct workers to work in order to save construction projects, so that the project could be maintained.

In New China, these technicians have begun to realize that only by combining their scientific knowledge with the practical experience of the working masses can they quickly open the door to creativity and ensure that their designs have good results in use. Yu Songru encountered difficulties in welding when manufacturing the steam port of the turbine. Initially, he found the theory of "neutral flame welding nickel-chromium steel" in books, but when he tried welding, the nickel-chromium steel of the steam port still cracked. So he went to Tang Yanzhang, a worker with 30 years of welding experience, to study, who said: "To avoid cracking when using neutral flame welding, you must weld both sides repeatedly at the same time." As a result, the steam port was successfully manufactured. Liu Dianyu also often uses the experience of the working masses to enrich his knowledge and wisdom. He and his workmates organized a technical research group and often exchanged opinions informally. The mold he designed for driving screws was relatively clumsy, and the screws were not easy to take out. When he and his workmates studied, a forging assistant said: "This is not difficult, just peel it like a peanut!" Inspired by this, Liu Dianyu changed the model to a two-part combination, which worked better. In the process of designing the white coal car, Zhang Deqing also often invited coppersmiths, technicians, and relevant engineers to study and discuss together, and constantly revised the drawings of the white coal furnace based on their opinions. Sometimes he even brought a lunch box and worked with the workers, guiding their work at any time. After the white coal car was successfully converted, he was afraid that the drivers would not use it, and it was not easy to gather the drivers scattered on the lines, so he picked up a small blackboard and drawings and ran to various cars to explain.

In the old society, the view of not being involved in politics was prevalent among technicians. Zhang Deqing was also one of them in the past, so he did not participate in political study when he entered the transportation company. However, in the process of working, he has discovered that without studying politics, he cannot serve New China well, serve the people well. One day at a study group meeting, everyone began to notice that Zhang Deqing was sitting there with a book on the history of social development, wearing glasses. Since then, he has become a regular member of political study.

　　新中国的模范技术人员
    全国工农兵劳动模范代表介绍
    【新华社二十五日讯】在祖国建设事业上作着卓越贡献的模范技术人员，已成批地开始在人民的新中国产生。这些技术人员的知识、才能和广大工农群众的劳动经验结合起来，正在有力地推动着新中国的生产力向前迈进。这次被选出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表中就有许多是这样的新型技术人员。
    在动力部门，天津中国纺织建设公司一厂原动部工程师于松如，应用最新科学理论，改装了老旧锅炉，使其效能显著提高，而燃煤却大为节省。他的创造式的工作给技术人员提供了如何在现有条件下提高生产的最好范例。八月份该厂链子炉发一度电只用燃煤零点六八二公斤，比该厂煤耗最低的一九四七年四月还低百分之四十三。因之该厂自今年一月至七月已节省燃煤二千六百余吨。目前他的这个节煤方法正在天津普遍推广，并已收到相当成效。
    上海公共交通公司机务处长兼总工程师张德庆鉴于燃料汽油需自国外购入，苦心钻研，创造了第五式综合白煤炉，把汽油车改装为白煤车。白煤炉装的车子既不损伤原有机件，走起路来和汽油车也没有两样。而白煤价格只及汽油的七分之一，这就给交通公司每月节省了二十二亿元的燃料费，并为国家节省了外汇。
    在电信部门，过去我国的长途电话线路“交叉”都是外国人设计的，并且机械地搬用美国的“交叉”，所以串音很大，又很浪费材料。中央人民政府邮电部长途电信总局副局长兼工程师侯德原经过苦心研究，设计出了一套适合于我国材料的“八八式线路交叉”。应用这种“交叉”，每对线都能通三路载波电话，所以一根电线杆子上装的电线，可以有九十六对人同时讲话，互不干扰。这种“交叉”不但串音少，还能保持秘密，又节省材料。由于采用这种“交叉”，今年在全国只交叉钢板一项节省费用就合九十四万七千多斤小米。
    要提高中国的生产力，改进农业耕作方法是非常重要的，可是过去我国机器制造业却很少去为农民改良农具，湖北机械农垦处机器制造厂副技师刘殿宇则在今年短短的七个月中，设计制成了一套从翻土到收割的新式农具。其中包括单边轻便犁、畜力弹簧耙、五行播种机、畜力五齿中耕除草机、畜力收割机、龙骨水车等九种。这些农具都已在农场试用，效率很好。如五行播种机的生产效率就较旧式的提高了五倍。
    在玉门油矿——许多人都认为是作不出奇迹来的戈壁滩上，年青的助理工程师王曰才却作出了奇迹。他创造了一部测量油井使用的电测仪器——直流放大器。这个仪器可以准确地测出地层的性质和油层的深度，克服了原来油矿使用的一部美国电测仪器的不准确的缺点。由于他的创造，目前玉门油矿已安全地开凿了七口油井。
    在新中国为人民作了一巨大贡献的优秀的技术人员，除上面所举的以外还有很多。如鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂工程师孙照森、唐山钢厂工程师赵乃斌等都是很好的代表。
    这些技术人员在国民党反动统治时期，一般是不被重视甚至是被排挤的。因此在旧中国，他们的工作热情没有得到发挥，知识技能也没有得到充分应用。例如刘殿宇解放前在国民党政府救济总署农业复员委员会工作时，就经常向主管人提出改良农具的建议，但是得到的回答却是：“要搞，请美国人来，你能干什么！？”又如张德庆在国民党统治时期就曾作上海公共交通公司汽车修造厂厂长，但因常受欺辱排挤，而弃职离开。但是，在新中国，他们却受到了重视和鼓励，他们得到了为祖国为人民服务的机会。例如张德庆，在上海解放后被交通公司邀请回来担任了机务处长。又如侯德原由于在电信传输上确有专长，在华东区电信管理局成立时，首先就被请担任了工务处第一处处长，接着由中央人民政府邮电部调任电信总局技术处副处长，接着又调升现任的长途电信总局副局长。今年三月全国长途电信工务会议并决定全国都采用他的“交叉”。政府又在七月间发给他四千斤米的奖金。由于受到国家的重视和鼓励，又由于他们已逐渐认识并从切身体验中感到自己确实是新中国的主人翁，是工人阶级的一员，应该全心全意为人民服务，他们的工作态度已有了显著的改变。在解放前被邀请也不肯检修透平机的于松如，一连自动三次向行政负责人建议愿意担负检修透平机的工作。正在德士古洋行享受着较高待遇的张德庆又欣然回到了交通公司。在新中国他们的工作热情是这样高，创造欲望是这样强，以至刘殿宇为了设计播种机，在过年的时候，眼看别人都回家团圆去了。自己却整整四昼夜坐在办公室里苦心钻研。尽管问题很复杂，而侯德原设计的“八八式线路交叉”，竟然是利用业余时间来完成的。察南专署水利局马树人工程师，为了抢救建筑工程，亲自下到寒气刺骨的水里指挥工人工作，使工程得以坚持下来。
    在新中国，这些技术人员已开始认识到只有把自己的科学知识和工人群众的实际经验结合起来，才能迅速地打开创造的大门，才能使所设计的东西在使用中收到良好效果。于松如在制造透平机的汽口时，曾遇到烧焊的困难。起初他从书本上找到“中性焰烧焊镍铬钢”的理论，可是试焊时，汽口的镍铬钢仍然张裂。于是他就去找有三十年烧焊经验的工人唐彦章研究，唐说：“使用中性焰烧焊，要避免裂口，必须两面反覆同时烧焊”。结果汽口果然制造成功。刘殿宇也是经常以工人群众的经验来丰富自己的知识和智慧的。他和工友们组织了一个技术研究小组，不拘形式地经常互相交换意见。他设计的打螺丝的模子比较笨拙，螺丝不容易拿出来。他和工友们研究时，一个锻工助手说：“这还不容易，像剥花生一样的剥就行了！”经这一启示，刘殿宇把模型改为两半合成的就好使了。张德庆在设计白煤车的过程中，也经常邀请铜匠、技工和有关工务员一起来研究讨论，根据他们的意见不断地修正白煤炉的图样。有时他甚至带着饭盒，和工人们一起干活，随时指导工人工作。在白煤车改装成功后，他怕司机不会使用，而司机又散在线路上不易集中，他就拿起小黑板和图样，跑到各处汽车上去讲解。
    在旧社会，技术人员中普遍地存在有不问政治的观点。张德庆过去也是其中的一个，因此他进交通公司时是不参加政治学习的。但是在工作过程中他已发现不学习政治就不能很好地为新中国服务、为人民服务。有一天在学习小组会上，大家开始发现张德庆挟着一本社会发展史，带上眼镜端坐在那里。从此以后，他已成为政治学习的经常的一员。
