　　Wang Yuecai's Transformation of the "Vacuum Tube DC Amplifier"
    Ushers in a New Era for Electric Surveying Work at the Yumen Oilfield
    Comrade Wang Yuecai is a young engineer at the Yumen Oilfield Mining Bureau. For the past year since liberation, he has been responsible for drilling electrical surveying work.
    Under the call to support the front lines, he worked day and night, highly leveraging his spirit of active innovation to research and improve electrical surveying instruments. The improvement of the "Vacuum Tube DC Amplifier" is the result of his efforts. At that time, materials were extremely scarce, and he used scrap materials to piece together a P-R type current reverser to transform a weak direct current into a square wave alternating current. He then amplified it with a vacuum tube amplifier with an extremely low frequency (around 20C), and then converted the amplified square wave alternating current into an intermittent direct current using a constant current reverser to drive a reflective galvanometer. This not only stabilized the unstable baseline phenomenon of oilfield electrical surveying results, resistance coefficient, and natural potential curves that had persisted for many years, but also allowed for the measurement of three curves simultaneously. At the same time, the amplification factor was increased and could be adjusted at will, and repairs became much more convenient than before. Due to his creation, the Yumen Oilfield will gradually transition from qualitative to quantitative oil layer analysis, ushering in a new beginning for electrical surveying work. Thanks to his creation, the Yumen Oilfield has safely drilled seven oil wells so far. In addition, his creations, such as the automatic current and voltage regulation instrument for ultraviolet lamps, are also valuable contributions.
    This is because, under the leadership and education of the Chinese Communist Party and through his own personal experience, Comrade Wang Yuecai recognized that he is the master of the country, established a new work ethic, and was able to integrate with the workers. Comrade Wang Yuecai has always been proactive in his work, always taking the lead in drilling operations, often working with the workers until late at night. He does his best to help solve the workers' difficulties, especially caring for those who are sick. Therefore, the workers are closely united around him, enabling the combination of science and technology and labor, and allowing the wisdom of the working class to be brought into play.
    It also shows that Comrade Wang Yuecai has the characteristics of daring to innovate boldly, breaking the conservative viewpoint of technology. According to a 1947 article in an American magazine, stabilizing the power supply for DC amplification requires six vacuum tubes, with a stabilization rate of over 25,000. Japanese engineers also believed in their writings that it was not easy to do well. However, the young Chinese engineer, Comrade Wang Yuecai, diligently studied and boldly created, breaking the conservative viewpoint with facts under difficult conditions.
    The construction work of the new China has also brought new tasks to the Yumen Oilfield, which is to cultivate new oilfield talents. Comrade Wang Yuecai is responsible for the apprenticeship work in the electrical surveying department. He is very patient, often taking the time to explain some simple electrical surveying principles to the worker comrades and new learners. He always discusses things with everyone and helps them solve difficulties so that everyone can master the technology and principles as quickly as possible. Because he understands that only by improving everyone's skills can production be improved.
    Comrade Wang Yuecai possesses the advantages of a new type of technical personnel, being able to combine theory and practice, and being able to form an integrated whole with the worker masses. In the "May 1st" merit campaign, he was democratically evaluated as a people's hero. This time, he was selected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. (Attached picture)

### 王曰才改造“真空管直流放大器”  使玉门油矿电测工作走向新时期

　　王曰才改造“真空管直流放大器”
    使玉门油矿电测工作走向新时期
    王曰才同志是玉门油矿矿务局的青年工程师。解放一年来，他一直担负着钻井电测工作。
    在支援前线的号召下，他不分昼夜的工作，高度发挥积极创造的精神，研究改进电测仪器。“真空管直流放大器”的改良，就是他努力的成果。当时，材料异常缺乏，他利用废料拚凑，使Ｐ——Ｒ式的电流变向器将微弱的直流，变成矩波状交流；用极低周率（２０Ｃ左右）的真空管放大器放大，然后再将放大之矩形波状交流经常流，变向器变为断续直流，推动反照型电流计。使多年来油矿电测结果、电阻系数和固有电位曲线的基线不稳现象，不仅可以稳定，并且还可以测出三条曲线；同时放大的倍数增加，能够随意调节；修理起来，更较以前方便的多了。由于他的创造，将使玉门油矿逐步的由油层的定性而走向定量，使电测工作走向新的开始，由于他的创造，目前玉门油矿已安全地开凿了七眼油井。此外，还有紫外光灯的自动调节电流、电压的仪器等创造，也是很有价值的贡献。
    这是由于王曰才同志在中国共产党的领导和教育下，和自己的亲身体验中，认识到自己是国家的主人翁，树立了新的劳动态度，并能和工人打成一片的结果。王曰才同志工作一贯积极，在钻井工作中，总是亲自动手，以身作则，常常和工人一起工作到深夜。对于工人们的困难，他能尽力帮助解决，特别是关心病了的工人。因此工人们都紧紧地团结在他的周围，使科学技术和劳动得以结合，使工人阶级的智慧得以发挥。
    同时也说明：王曰才同志具有勇于大胆制造，打破了技术保守观点的特点。关于直流放大为稳定电源，据一九四七年美国某杂志刊载称：需用六个真空管，稳定率要在二五○○○以上。日本工程师的著作上也认为是不易作好的。但是，中国年青的工程师——王曰才同志，努力钻研，大胆创造，在困难的条件下用事实打破了保守的观点。
    新中国的建设工作，给玉门油矿也带来了新的任务，就是培养新的油矿人材。王曰才同志担负了电测部门的带徒弟工作，他很耐心，经常抽时间给工人同志和新的学习人员讲解一些浅近的电测原理，有事总和大家商量，帮助他们解决困难，使大家能尽快的掌握技术和原理。因为他懂得：只有使大家提高技术，才能使生产搞好。
    王曰才同志具备了新型技术人员的优点，能够把理论和实践结合起来，能够和工人群众结成一体，“五一”立功运动中，他被民主评议为人民功臣；这次，又被评选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。（附图片）
