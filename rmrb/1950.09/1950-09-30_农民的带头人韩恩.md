　　Han En, who was awarded the title of Special-Class Labor Model of Jilin Province, is the secretary of the Communist Party branch in Bao'an Village, Jiaohe County. He was elected as a member of the District Committee at the Xin'an District Party Representative Conference last December. At the same time, he is one of the outstanding model village cadres in the province and a representative of the First Northeast People's Representative Conference.

　　Since the land reform in the spring of 1947, Han En responded to the government's call and, together with other activists, organized three mutual aid teams. Because they utilized the power of organization and overcame the difficulty of lacking draught animals, the average yield of grain per hectare during the autumn harvest was six and a half shi (石, unit of dry measure), which was one and a half shi more than during the puppet Manchukuo period. After the autumn harvest, individual households followed suit and voluntarily joined the teams. At this time, he changed the fixed small groups into flexible joint groups according to actual production needs. Over the years, this method has become more and more practical, eventually developing into the current form of joint groups.

　　This year, Han En's mutual aid team has a scale of: thirty-five male and female full and half laborers, forty-four livestock, fourteen carts, and a set of Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements. Their crops in both paddy and dry fields are growing very well (especially the eighteen hectares of land cultivated using horse-drawn farm implements, the seedlings are particularly robust). It is estimated that the average yield of dry land per hectare will be ten shi; the highest yield of paddy fields can be forty shi, an increase of more than 50% compared to 1947.

　　The reason why Han En's mutual aid team is doing so well is that it has good leaders, and Han En is one of the main ones.

　　Han En is able to create new working methods based on objective needs. For example, when the mutual aid was first organized, there was no exchange of labor between groups. A job that could have been done by five people required all seven laborers in the group to be mobilized, and after finishing it, they would go elsewhere, wasting labor on the road. Therefore, Han En came up with a way to allocate labor. Labor was allocated according to the needs of each piece of land, and the boundaries between groups were broken down. This "flexible organization of fixed groups" conformed to the requirements of production and laid the foundation for moving towards joint groups.

　　Secondly, he is familiar with the moods of the team members and appropriately adjusts labor according to each person's actual situation. For example, Liu Zuorong and his son often argued, so Han En separated them, and later they both had more energy when working. Ye Jin's wife was very young, and separating her from her husband would affect their emotions, so they were assigned to work together. In this way, their enthusiasm for labor was encouraged, and production efficiency was improved.

　　Thirdly, he pays attention to uniting and winning over individual households. In the spring of 1947, Zhang Yuhai and three other households were afraid of suffering losses, so they worked on their own. Later, whenever the team held meetings or settled accounts for sideline occupations, Han En invited them to listen in. They slowly realized the benefits of the mutual aid team, and finally they voluntarily requested to join the mutual aid team.

　　His work style is democratic, and everyone discusses matters together. At each meeting, Han En never started by giving a long lecture, but rather raised the issue and let everyone discuss it. He listened carefully to others' opinions before finally speaking: summarizing everyone's opinions and explaining the instructions from higher authorities; at the same time, he unified and combined the two into a resolution of the meeting, calling on the masses to implement it. In this way, the masses could all implement the resolution as if it were their own business. For example, the implementation of the exchange labor system in their team was the result of detailed discussions by everyone and was resolutely implemented by everyone.

　　In addition, his work is planned. For example, before arranging work, a meeting of party members and cadres is first held to draw up a draft plan for the next step, and then a general meeting is held to solicit the opinions of the masses, and finally a work plan is determined and handed over to everyone to ensure its completion.

　　Han En never forgets that he is a Communist Party member and is always concerned about the affairs of the masses. During festivals, he often visits door to door, caring about whether others have difficulties. He is especially mindful of military families, and he helps solve any problems, big or small, in production at any time. Last year, An Yongda (Korean)'s paddy field suffered from insect pests, so Han En lent him 100 jin of his own rice and borrowed another 200 jin from the district to solve the problem of rice seeds for An Yongda.

　　In the past, Bao'an Village was a "poor stick alley" looked down upon by others. Thanks to Han En's three years of active leadership in production mutual aid, the village has changed its face, and the lives of the peasants have gradually become prosperous. Yang Chengxue, who couldn't even afford a kang mat in the early days, has now replaced his family with new clothes and also has two horses. Liu Zuorong, who wore a burlap sack during the puppet Manchukuo period, now has a horse, a fat pig weighing more than 300 jin, and a rubber-tired cart. After the land reform, Chi Dianwen not only married a wife, but also owned four large cattle. Except for the three newly moved households, the remaining twenty-four households in the village have risen to become middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants.

### 农民的带头人韩恩

　　农民的带头人韩恩
    韩恩曾荣获吉林省特等劳动模范的称号，他是中共蛟河县保安屯的支部书记。去年十二月新站区党员代表大会上，他被选为区委委员。同时他又是全省出色的模范村干部之一，第一届东北各界人民代表会议的代表。
    自一九四七年春天土地改革后，韩恩即响应了政府的号召，和其他积极分子一起，组织起三个互助组。因为发挥了组织的力量，克服了缺乏耕畜的困难，当年秋收，每垧地即平均就有六石五斗粮的收成，比伪满时多收了一石五斗。秋后，单干户也就跟着自动地参加了组。这时，他就根据实际生产的需要，把固定的小组变成为灵活的联组。几年来运用这种办法，越做越切合实际，最后发展到现在的联组形式。
    今年韩恩互助组的规模是：全组有三十五个男女整半劳力，四十四头牲口，十四辆大车，一套苏联式的马拉农具。他们水旱田庄稼长得都很好（特别是使用马拉农具耕种的十八垧地，苗禾更是肥壮）。估计旱田每垧地平均可有十石收成；水田最高收成可有四十石，较一九四七年每垧增产百分之五十强。
    韩恩互助组所以能搞得好，原因是在有好的带头人，韩恩就是其中主要的一个。
    韩恩能够根据客观的需要，创造新的工作方法。譬如在刚组织互助时，组与组之间不换工，本来五个人能干完的活，全组的七个劳动力都出动，干完后再转到别处去干，把工都消耗在道上了。于是韩恩就想出拨工的办法。根据每块地的需要去拨工，并打开了组与组的界限。这种“死组活编”的组织形式，正合乎生产的要求，奠定了走向联组的基础。
    其次是他能熟悉组员们的心情，依据每个人的实际情况适当地调剂劳力。譬如刘作荣父子俩在一起常常争吵，韩恩就把他们分开，以后干活时他们就都有了劲。叶金的妻子很年青，若把她与丈夫分开干活，会影响彼此的情绪，于是把他们夫妇俩拨在一起干。这样，就鼓舞了他们的劳动热情，而提高了生产效率。
    再次，是注意团结和争取单干户。一九四七年春天，张玉海等三户怕吃亏，就自己单干。以后每逢组里开会或是副业结账时，韩恩都请他们来旁听。他们慢慢地认识到互助组的好处，最后他们自动要求参加了互助组。
    他的作风民主，有事大家商量。韩恩在每次开会时，决不是自己先说一套大道理，只是把问题提出来，让大家展开讨论。他细心倾听别人的意见，最后才发言：一面归纳大家的意见，一面讲出上级的指示；同时又把这二者统一结合，变成大会的决议，号召群众来执行。这样，群众都能把决议当成自己的事情去贯彻。像他们组里实行换工制度时，都是经过大家详细讨论的，并由大家坚决执行了。
    另外，他工作有计划。如在布置工作前，先召开党员干部会议，订出下一步的计划草案，然后开大会，征求群众的意见，最后确定工作计划，交由大家保证完成。
    韩恩任何时候也忘不了自己是个共产党员，时时关心着群众的事情。逢年过节，他常挨家访问，关心别人是否有困难。特别对军属，他更留心，不论生产上的大小事情，他都随时帮助解决。去年安永达（朝鲜人）的水田遭了虫灾，韩恩就把自己的大米借给他一百斤，又从区里给他借了二百斤，给安永达解决了稻种问题。
    从前，保安屯是被人瞧不起的“穷棒子瞧”，由于韩恩三年如一日的积极领导生产互助，该村已改变了面貌，农民生活已逐渐走向丰衣足食。早先连炕席都铺不起的杨成学，现在全家已换上了新衣，还有二匹马。伪满时披着麻袋片的刘作荣，今天也有了一匹马，一个三百多斤的大肥猪和一辆胶皮车。迟殿文在土改后不但娶了媳妇，并且还拥有四条大牛。全屯除了新搬来的三户外，其余二十四户都上升为中农和富裕中农。
