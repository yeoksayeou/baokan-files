Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The "Regulations on the Standards for Determining Agricultural Tax Land Area and Normal Annual Yield," drafted by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government, has been submitted to and approved by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and promulgated for implementation. The purpose of formulating this document is to standardize the calculation standards for land area and normal annual yield, so as to ensure the correct implementation of the "Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas." The document states that these regulations apply not only to newly liberated areas, but also to old areas. The contents of this document are as follows:

　　I. The "市亩" (shì mǔ, city mu) shall be the basic unit for land area, with each 市亩 being sixty 方市丈 (fāng shì zhàng, square city zhang) (each 市丈 is ten 市尺 (shì chǐ, city chi), and each 市尺 is equal to one-third of a meter). However, in areas where 市亩 is not yet commonly used, district and village registrations may temporarily use local customary mu or "垧" (shǎng) as units, which shall be converted into 市亩 by the county people's government, reported in a list, and explained in detail.

　　II. Land yield shall be based on the normal annual yield. Normal annual yield refers to the yield that various types of land should harvest throughout the year based on their natural conditions, local general management conditions, and planting habits under normal crop years.

　　1. Natural conditions of the land refer to: soil quality, water conservancy, terrain (high, low, flat), climate (temperature, rainfall), wind direction, sunlight, etc.

　　2. Land management conditions refer to: the labor, animal power, fertilizer, and cultivation techniques applied to the land by general farmers in the area. For land of equal quality, if the harvest exceeds the normal annual yield of the same land due to diligent cultivation and good management, the increased portion shall not be counted; if the harvest is less than the normal annual yield of the same land due to negligent cultivation, the reduced portion shall not be deducted.

　　3. Planting habits refer to: the number of plantings and the types of crops planted by general farmers under local natural conditions and general management conditions. Whether one crop, two crops, or three crops are harvested in a year, the entire annual yield shall be calculated; whether three crops are harvested in two years, four crops in three years, or five crops in three years, the average annual yield shall be calculated (e.g., for three crops in two years, the total yield of the three crops is divided by two, and the rest are analogous). The stalks, stems, and grasses of each season's crops shall not be included in the harvest.

　　III. Land planted with various cash crops (such as cotton, hemp, peanuts, tobacco, etc.) shall be determined according to the standard of the normal annual yield of general grains planted on the same type of land.

　　IV. The normal annual yield shall be converted into staple grain for calculation. Staple grain refers to: the most commonly planted grain in the area (such as millet in North China, sorghum in Northeast China, rice in Jiangnan, wheat in Northwest China, etc.). The conversion ratio of various crops to staple grain shall be stipulated by the provincial (municipal) people's government and reported to the Greater Administrative Region People's Government (Military and Political Committee) for verification.

　　V. The 市斤 (shì jīn, city catty) shall be the basic unit of calculation for staple grain (each 市斤 is one-half kilogram, i.e., 500 grams, equivalent to 13.5 taels of Kuping weight), and the 市斗 (shì dòu, city peck) shall be the auxiliary unit (市斗 is the same as 公斗 (gōng dòu, metric peck), which is 10,000 cubic centimeters). In areas where 市斤 and 市斗 are not yet commonly used, districts and villages may temporarily register according to local units, which shall be converted and reported by the county (municipal) people's government with detailed notes.

　　VI. The Greater Administrative Regions or provincial (municipal) people's governments may, based on these regulations and with reference to local conditions, formulate specific regulations and report them to the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government for the record.

　　中央人民政府财政部规定
    计算土地面积及常年应产量标准
    保证新区老区农业税征收政策的正确执行
    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府财政部所拟定的《农业税土地面积及常年应产量订定标准的规定》，业经呈奉政务院财政经济委员会批准公布施行。制定这个文件的目的，是为了统一土地面积和常年应产量的计算标准，以便保证《新解放区农业税暂行条例》的正确执行。文件中说明：此项规定不仅适用于新解放区，同样也适用于老区。这个文件内容如下：
    一、土地面积以“市亩”为基本单位，每市亩为六十方市丈（每市丈为十市尺，每市尺等于三分之一公尺），但在市亩尚未通行地区，区村登记得暂以当地习惯亩或“垧”为单位，由县人民政府折合市亩，列表具报，并详加说明。
    二、土地产量以常年应产量为标准。常年应产量是指：各种土地根据其自然条件和当地一般经营条件及种植习惯，在平常年成下，全年所应收获的产量。
    １、土地自然条件是指：土质、水利、地势（高、洼、平坦）、气候（温度、雨量）、风向、阳光等。
    ２、土地经营条件是指：当地一般农户对土地所施劳力、畜力、肥料及耕作技术等。同等的土地，因勤劳耕作，善于经营，其收获量超过同等土地的常年应产量者，其增加部分不多计；因怠于耕作，收获量不及同等土地的常年应产量者，其减产部分亦不少计。
    ３、种植习惯是指：在当地自然条件与一般经营条件下，一般农户种植的次数和种植的作物。一年收一季、一年收二季或一年收三季的，均按一年全部应产量计算；二年收三季、三年收四季或三年收五季的，均按每年平均应产量计算（如二年收三季者，即以二除三季总产量，其余类推）。各季作物的秸、秆、禾草均不计入收获之内。
    三、种植各种经济作物（如棉花、麻、花生、烟叶等）的土地，应按相同的土地种植一般谷物的常年应产量的标准订定之。
    四、常年应产量应折合主粮计算。主粮是指：当地种植最多的谷物（如华北的粟谷、东北的高粱、江南的稻谷、西北的小麦等）各种作物与主粮折合比例由省（市）人民政府规定，报请大行政区人民政府（军政委员会）核定之。
    五、主粮以市斤为基本计算单位（每市斤为二分之一公斤，即五百格兰姆，合库平制秤十三两五），以市斗为辅助单位（市斗即公斗，为一万立方厘米）。市斤与市斗尚未通行地区，区、村得暂按当地通行单位登记，由县（市）人民政府折合具报，并加注明。
    六、各大行政区或省（市）人民政府得根据本规定，参照当地情况，拟订具体的规定，报请中央人民政府政务院备案。
