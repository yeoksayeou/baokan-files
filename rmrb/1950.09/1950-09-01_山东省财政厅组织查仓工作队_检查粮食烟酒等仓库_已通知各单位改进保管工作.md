The Shandong Provincial Department of Finance Organizes Warehouse Inspection Team
    Inspects Grain, Liquor, and Other Warehouses
    Notifies All Units to Improve Storage Work
    [This newspaper's Jinan dispatch] In order to prevent warehouse materials from mildewing and being damaged during the rainy season, the Shandong Provincial People's Government's Department of Finance specially transferred 35 cadres to organize a warehouse inspection team. The team inspected the warehouses of six units, including grain and liquor. The work began on July 31st and ended on August 5th.

            Grain Warehouse Keepers are Responsible and Conscientious; Large Quantities of Stored Grain are Saved from Insect Infestation and Mildew
    During the inspection, it was found that the staff of various departments were generally able to be active, responsible, and conscientious in their work. Specifically, grain warehouses generally have relatively sound organizations, relatively formal work systems, clear divisions of labor in each group, and have established dedicated personnel to inspect grain. Tools and materials are also in good order. They have also made considerable achievements in grain storage during the rainy season, appropriately adjusting temperature, and avoiding insect infestation. For example, after several efforts of inventorying and sorting, Jinan Grain Station has generally changed the phenomenon of discrepancies between grain ledgers and actual grain. Warehouse management personnel further use scientific instruments to measure grain temperature and warehouse temperature, and test grain moisture. In the rainy season, they maintain a normal state where grain temperature is lower than warehouse temperature, so that all stored grain does not experience insect infestation, mildew, or heating. For example, 2 million catties of corn transported from Pingyuan to the grain station had excessive moisture and were experiencing insect infestation and mildew. After actively turning the grain, flipping bags, and killing insects, the moisture content was reduced from 16% to 14%. Insects outside the bags and near the edges of the bags have been killed, and insects inside the bags can also be completely eradicated after sieving. After insecticide application, the grain temperature dropped from the original 37 degrees to 33 degrees. This proves that insect infestation is one of the causes of increased grain temperature. At the same time, some model figures with excellent performance have emerged among the staff. For example, Song Wenshan of Jinan Grain Station inspects all warehouses once a day and reports the results of grain temperature, warehouse temperature, insects, and moisture to the responsible comrades every day and puts forward handling opinions. Wang Lunyi, the leader of the storage group of Jinan Second Grain Depot, and Zhang Chuankai, the receiving and dispatching clerk, even worked while sick, climbing to the roof at night when it rained to close the skylights. Also, Zhang Qinglian of the depot has a good democratic style, is enthusiastic about learning scientific grain storage methods (such as using wet and dry hygrometers and thermometers for experiments), has a strong sense of responsibility, and her work is also planned.

    In terms of tobacco and alcohol warehouses, the electrical equipment of Huangtai Cigarette Factory is still relatively complete, with fuse boxes, fuses, lightning arresters, etc. Various materials are stored separately, neatly and orderly, with clear numbers and relatively formal procedures.

    The materials in other warehouses are of about 1,000 kinds, with a total value of 1 billion yuan. Except for 7,545 barrels of paint, which may change if stored for too long, other materials have been sun-dried three times, re-sorted, and stored separately. Those originally close to the wall and easily affected by dampness have been moved. Camphor pills have been added to materials such as silk, hemp, leather, and fur. According to the current situation, insect infestation and mildew are unlikely to occur during the rainy season. In order to prevent electric leakage and fire, indoor wires have also been removed. The management of sentry posts, doors, and windows is also very strict, and accidents are generally unlikely to occur.

            Serious Losses and Waste Occur in Huangtai and Jinan Alcohol Factories
    However, some units are suffering serious losses and waste of assets due to insufficient management. For example, Huangtai Alcohol Factory used gasoline barrels to store alcohol, resulting in more than 130 barrels (over 40,000 catties) of alcohol being unsellable due to the gasoline smell. Jinan Alcohol Factory also had the same situation, causing more than 10,000 catties of alcohol to be returned from Tai'an and other places, wasting more than 400,000 yuan in transportation costs. However, the factory still believes that this "is not a loss or the loss is not large." Huangtai Alcohol Factory currently has about 500,000 catties of millet stored in bulk warehouses, with widespread insect infestation about half an inch thick. 30,000 catties of stored corn also have 2.5% insect infestation. The factory's coal storage site has never been cleaned up, so there is coal everywhere in the grass, air-raid shelters, and low-lying areas. After a year of wind and water erosion, the factory estimates that the loss is more than 50,000 or 60,000 catties.

    Furthermore, some valuable machine parts are mixed with scrap iron, and the storage is also disordered. If they are not handled quickly, it may lead to losses. Huangtai Alcohol Factory has about 40 tons of this scrap iron, and Jinan Alcohol Factory also has about 5 tons.

            All Units Do Not Pay Enough Attention to Fire Prevention; No Repairs are Made to Leaking Electrical Wires
    According to preliminary understanding, all units do not pay enough attention to fire prevention equipment and are negligent in their thinking, with the idea that "there is no problem." For example, Huangtai Alcohol Factory is satisfied that its electrical equipment is good and will not cause problems. The factory's electrical technician said: "We haven't had a fire here in over 20 years." Although there are "No Smoking" signs posted everywhere in the factory, workers and staff still smoke in the warehouse. The Tobacco and Alcohol Company's Transportation Department bought a box of fire extinguishers and placed them in the dormitory. The fire extinguishers of Huangtai Cigarette Factory are placed in the storage room. A motor wire in Jinan Alcohol Factory is leaking electricity, making pedestrians afraid to approach. When the switch is turned on in Jinan Grain Station's Small No. 4 warehouse, the door and lock are all electrified, and the wall also leaks electricity when it rains. These phenomena deserve the vigilance and attention of all units.

    The reason for the above situation is that the departments concerned do not start from the existing conditions to gradually and actively improve their work, but instead demand to solve the problems once and for all. They want to do it well if they do it at all. If they cannot reach the ideal state, they rely on others, wait, and put things off. Moreover, they do not go deep into their work and do not understand their business, so they cannot actively solve problems. After the inspection, the Provincial Department of Finance has notified the relevant departments to correct the problems one by one and report the results.

　　山东省财政厅组织查仓工作队
    检查粮食烟酒等仓库 
    已通知各单位改进保管工作
    【本报济南讯】山东省人民政府财政厅，为防止雨季仓库物资霉烂损坏，特抽调干部三十五名，组织查仓工作队。对粮食、烟酒等六个单位的仓库进行检查。自七月三十一日开始至八月五日全部工作结束。
            粮库保管人员认真负责  大批存粮免于虫蚀霉烂
    检查中，发现各部门工作人员，一般都能积极负责、认真工作，具体表现在：粮食仓库一般组织均较健全，工作制度较正规，各组有明确分工，并建立专人检查粮食，工具物资亦井然有序。并在雨季粮食保管、适当调节温度、避免虫蚀等方面，都作出了不少成绩。例如：济南粮站经过几次的努力清点、整理的结果，一般已改变了过去粮账不符的现象，仓库管理人员更进一步运用科学仪器，测量粮温、仓温，并化验粮食水分，在伏雨季节保持粮温低于仓温的正常状态，使所有存粮未发生虫蚀、霉烂、发热等现象。又如该粮站从平原运来的二百万斤苞米，水分过高，以及发生虫蚀、发霉，经过积极倒仓、翻包、杀虫等工作，使水分从百分之十六降为百分之十四；袋外和靠近袋边的虫均已杀死，袋内虫子过筛后亦可以全部根绝。经过施药杀虫后，粮温从原三十七度降至三十三度。由此，证明虫害是粮温增加的原因之一。同时，工作人员中，还涌现了一些表现很好的模范人物。例如济南粮站宋文山，每天检查所有仓库一遍，将检查的粮温、仓温、虫子、水分等结果，逐日向负责同志报告，并提出处理意见。济南第二粮库保管组长王伦义，收发张传楷更带病工作，夜间下雨爬上楼顶，关闭天窗。又该库张庆莲，民主作风较好，热心学习科学存粮方法（如用干湿计、温度计进行试验），工作责任心强，工作也显得有计划。
    在烟酒仓库方面，如黄台烟厂之电气设备还较完全，有保险盒、保险丝、避雷器等，各种物资均分别存放，整齐有序，数字清楚，手续较正规。
    其他仓库的物资，品类约有一千种，总值达十亿元。除颜料七千五百四十五桶，如存储时间过多，会发生变化外，其他物资已翻晒三次，重新整理，分类存放，原离墙较近、易受潮湿者，均移动了位置。绸、麻、皮、毛等一类物资均加了樟脑丸。根据目前情况，雨季不致发生虫蚀、霉烂等现象。为了防止走电失火，并将室内电线拆除。岗哨门窗管理亦甚严，一般不致发生意外。
            黄台济南两酒精厂损失浪费现象严重
    但目前有些单位由于管理不够完善，使资财遭受了严重的损失和浪费，如黄台酒精厂用汽油桶装酒精，致使一百三十余桶（四万余斤）酒精因有汽油味而卖不出去。济南酒精厂也有同样情形，使一万余斤酒精运到泰安等地，又如数退回，白花路费四十多万元，但该厂尚有认为这“不是损失或损失不大”的思想。黄台酒精厂现有小米约五十万斤，散仓存放，普遍生虫约一指半厚。存玉米三万斤亦有百分之二·五生虫。该厂存炭场所因从未整理，以致草棵里、防空洞里、洼坑里都是炭。年余风吹水流，其损失数据厂方估计在五、六万斤以上。
    再就是有些贵重机器零件与废铁掺杂一起，保管也无次序，如不迅速处理即可能招致损失。黄台酒精厂存有这种废铁约四十吨，济南酒精厂亦约有五吨。
            各单位均不重视防火  电线走电亦不加修理
    在防火设备上，据初步了解，各单位均不太重视，思想上麻痹大意，存在着“无问题”的想法。如黄台酒精厂满足于电气设备好不会出问题，该厂电气技师说：“我们这里二十多年没有失过火。”又该厂虽然到处贴有禁止吸烟的条子，但工人职员仍在仓库吸烟。烟酒公司保运部买的消防弹一箱，放在宿舍里。黄台烟厂的消防弹放在保管室内。济南酒精厂有一个马达电线走电，使行人不敢接近。济南粮站小四号仓房当电门一开，门上、锁上全都有电，下雨时墙上亦走电。这些现象是值得各单位加以警惕和注意的。
    产生以上情况的原因是，各该部门对工作不从现有条件出发，逐步的积极着手改进，而是要求一劳永逸，要办就办好，如达不到理想就依赖、等待、搁置不办，而且工作不深入，不了解业务，也就不能主动解决问题。经过检查，省财政厅已通知各有关部门逐一纠正，并将结果具报。
