Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 4th: The Southwest District financial authorities have completed 92.67% of the total grain procurement task for the Southwest District in 1949, as recently approved by the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government.

	The Southwest District was only liberated at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, so the public grain collection started relatively late. At that time, in order to supply the advancing army to the west and nearly one million uprising and surrendered troops, there was not enough time to collect grain according to a scientific class burden rate, and had to temporarily use the method of grain collection based on "tax yuan" from the Kuomintang era, with individual adjustments, in order to quickly concentrate the grain for use.

	During the collection process, the vast number of farmers in the Southwest wholeheartedly supported their liberators, and model examples of competing to hand over grain and good grain emerged everywhere. The Miao compatriots in Guizhou, the Yi compatriots in Yunnan, and the people of other fraternal ethnic groups also took the lead in actively handing over grain. Cheli and Fohai counties in the southernmost border of Yunnan were only liberated in May this year, but the Yi compatriots there completed the grain handover task earlier than other counties.

	At the same time, however, the grain procurement work encountered serious difficulties due to the sabotage of Kuomintang bandits and secret agents, and the resistance of landlords and local bullies and feudal forces. Some landlords even desperately wasted the wealth they had previously plundered from the farmers in the cities. The population of Guiyang City increased by 30,000 after liberation, most of whom were landlords.

	The People's Government, considering that some landlords had sold grain and saved cash at the beginning of the liberation of the Southwest in order to avoid burdens, therefore allowed them to pay public grain in cash, and repeatedly extended the grain handover time. However, by the end of the summer this year, few landlords had paid grain or money. In March and April this year, the Southwest region as a whole had only completed 30% to 40% of the grain procurement task.

	On the other hand, the People's Government, due to the initial establishment of institutions, few and weak cadres, unfamiliarity with local conditions, and the fact that some of the old township Baojia personnel still had strong old views and old styles of work, also experienced phenomena in some areas where the scope of the burden in grain procurement was too narrow and disproportionately light or heavy.

	Under such circumstances, two working methods emerged among local work cadres in completing the grain procurement task.

	The correct method, represented by Wanxian and Changshou counties in eastern Sichuan, was to hold people's representative conferences and farmer representative conferences, mobilize the peasant masses, unite rural intellectuals and enlightened gentry, mobilize all social forces to assist in grain procurement, control township Baojia chiefs, commend law-abiding landlords, persuade backward landlords, apply social pressure and even legal sanctions to landlords who resisted grain and refused to hand it over, and make appropriate adjustments to those whose grain quota was indeed disproportionately light or heavy. The result was that not only was the grain procurement task completed, but also the people of all strata were united and the rural united front was consolidated.

	Another method was to be helpless in the face of heavy tasks, tight deadlines, and landlord denial, which led to serious bureaucratic and commandist errors, alienating themselves from the masses, landlord resistance, social chaos, and cadre isolation, giving bandits and secret agents an opportunity to exploit.

	The Southwest Military and Political Committee and the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China quickly promoted the good experiences of Wanxian, Changshou and other places, corrected the rigid work style of cadres in various places, and at the same time adhered to the correct policy of collecting all public grain, supported the grain procurement cadres, and broke the landlords' attempts to deny their obligations. Thanks to the hard work of the grain procurement cadres, this correct policy has been quickly implemented, and many landlords have finally had to hand over the public grain they should have paid. After May, the grain procurement stalemate gradually broke, and the number of grain entering warehouses increased daily.

	The near completion of grain procurement in the Southwest is not only a victory in financial work, but also plays a huge role in stabilizing prices. The three price fluctuations at the end of last year and in February, March, and July this year were all suppressed by the government and state-owned trading companies controlling large amounts of grain and coordinating with other materials. At the same time, because the People's Government controls the grain, it has the power to support neighboring areas and relieve disasters. When there was a shortage of food in East China this spring, the Finance Department of the Southwest District supplied and transported 157 million catties of food to assist in disaster relief in East China. When parts of about 50 counties in the Southwest suffered from disasters this summer, the People's Government also had the power to allocate grain for relief and issue loan grain, so that the disaster situation quickly stopped developing. In addition, the more important gain is that during this grain procurement process, the peasants were mobilized, the resistance of the landlords and local bullies was attacked, and the foundation was laid for the rent reduction movement in the future.

### 西南征粮工作接近完成  正确的工作方法巩固了农村统一战线  官僚主义与命令主义造成孤立与混乱

　　西南征粮工作接近完成
    正确的工作方法巩固了农村统一战线
    官僚主义与命令主义造成孤立与混乱
    【新华社重庆四日电】西南区财经机关已完成了中央人民政府财政部最近所核定的西南区一九四九年征粮总任务的百分之九十二点六七。
    西南区至去年底和今年初才告解放，因此公粮开征较晚。当时为供应西进大军和将近一百万人的起义及投诚过来的部队，曾来不及按照科学的阶级负担率征粮，而不得不暂时沿用国民党时代按“赋元”征粮的方法并加以个别调整之后便迅速开征，以期粮食能迅速集中使用。
    在征收过程中，西南广大农民衷心拥护自己的解放者，到处都涌现了争先交粮与竞交好粮的模范。贵州苗胞和云南彝胞及其他各兄弟民族人民也带头踊跃交粮。云南极南边疆的车里、佛海等县今年五月始告解放，该地彝胞完成交粮任务却较他县为早。
    但同时，由于国民党土匪特务的破坏和地主恶霸封建势力的抗拒，征粮工作曾遭到严重的困难。一部分地主甚至到城市中拚命浪费他们往日从农民身上剥夺得来的资财。贵阳市解放后人口增加三万，其中绝大部分就是地主。
    人民政府考虑到若干地主在西南解放之初曾为了逃避负担而出卖粮食，保存现金，因而容许他们以现金折交公粮，并一再宽延交粮时间。但至今年夏季结束，地主交粮交款者仍少。今年三四月间，西南全区仅完成征粮任务的百分之三十到四十。
    另一方面，人民政府由于机构初建，干部少而弱，对地方情况不熟，同时旧的乡保甲人员中有的人还带着浓厚的旧观点旧作风，因而在某些地区也发生了在征粮中负担面过窄以及畸轻畸重的现象。
    在这样的情况下，各地地方工作干部在完成征粮任务中出现了两种工作方法。
    正确的方法以川东万县、长寿等县为代表，即开好各界人民代表会议和农民代表会议，发动农民群众，团结农村知识分子和开明士绅，动员一切社会力量，协助征粮，扩大负担面，掌握乡保甲长，对守法地主加以表扬，对落后地主进行劝说，对抗粮不交地主施以社会压力以至法律制裁，对负担粮额确实畸轻畸重者予以适当调整。这样做的结果，不仅完成了征粮任务，而且团结了各阶层人民，巩固了农村统一战线。
    另一种方法是在任务繁重、时间紧迫和地主抵赖的面前束手无策，因而发生了严重的官僚主义与命令主义错误，使自己脱离群众，地主顽抗，社会混乱，干部孤立，予土匪特务以可乘之机。
    西南军政委员会和中共中央西南局曾迅速地推广了万县、长寿等地的良好经验，纠正各地干部作风生硬的错误，同时又坚持征齐全部公粮的正确方针，给征粮干部撑腰，击破地主的抵赖企图。由于征粮干部的艰苦努力，这一正确的方针已迅速贯彻下去，许多地主终于不得不交出应当缴纳的公粮。五月以后征粮僵局便逐渐打开，粮食入仓数字日增。
    西南征粮工作的接近完成，不仅是财政工作的胜利，而且在争取物价稳定上起了巨大作用。去年底和今年二、三月及七月间三次物价波动，都由于政府和国营贸易公司掌握了大量粮食并配合其他物资将涨风抑止下去。同时，由于人民政府掌握了粮食，便有力量来支援邻区与救济灾荒。今春华东区青黄不接时，西南区财政部曾供运食粮一亿五千七百万斤协助华东区的救灾工作。当夏季西南各地约有五十余县的部分地区发生灾荒时，人民政府也有了力量去拨粮救济和发放贷粮，使灾情迅速地停止发展。此外，更重要的收获，是在此次征粮过程中，发动了农民，打击了地主恶霸的顽抗，为今后的减租运动打下了基础。
