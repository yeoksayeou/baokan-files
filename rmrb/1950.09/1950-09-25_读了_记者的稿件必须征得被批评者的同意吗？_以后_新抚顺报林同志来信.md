　　After Reading "Must Reporters Obtain the Consent of Those Being Criticized for Their Articles?"
    -- Letter from Comrade Lin of the Xin Fushun Newspaper

To the Editor:

    I am a reporter for the Xin Fushun Newspaper (formerly the Fushun Workers' Newspaper). I have some opinions on the letter from Comrade Lu Bo criticizing the Machine Repair Factory, which was published in the People's Garden on September 16th. I am submitting them for your reference.

    According to my understanding, the shortcomings of the Machine Repair Factory pointed out by Comrade Lu Bo are indeed facts. However, Comrade Lu Bo's article lacks necessary analysis. The reasons for the factory's waste, losses, and poor product quality are objectively due to the factory's old equipment, damaged parts, and urgent tasks. Subjectively, it is because the factory director's business skills are low, he lacks experience, his thinking is subjective, and he is not good at mobilizing and relying on technical personnel and the masses of workers to conduct thorough research and overcome difficulties. When a reporter conducts criticism, he should base it on objective facts, add calm analysis and correct estimation, and point out the direction for the criticized to improve their work. This is complete criticism. Comrade Lu Bo's article did not do this very well.

    Originally, in mid-June, our newspaper sent a female reporter to the factory to understand the situation. After seeing some shortcomings in the factory, this comrade simply listed them and gave them a label of "bureaucracy." The factory director, Wang Yang, argued with her and wrote a letter to the Municipal Party Committee (which was forwarded to the newspaper). Director Wang's attitude towards criticism was very bad, saying things like "imperial envoys flying all over the sky" and "treating fleas as tigers." We were all unhappy when we saw it, and Lu Bo was especially angry.

    Later, the newspaper assigned Comrade Lu Bo to understand the situation at the Machine Repair Factory. He went to the factory, got the work summary for the past six months, and collected many of the factory's shortcomings, writing an article (the one published in the People's Garden). After reading this article, I told Lu Bo my opinion, but he said angrily, "I don't care what he (referring to Director Wang Yang) does, anyway he has shortcomings, and I will write them out" (words to that effect). Obviously, this critical attitude is not correct enough.

    However, the Fushun Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department's handling of Lu Bo's article was also inappropriate. Since they did not agree to publish Lu Bo's manuscript, they should have quickly investigated and dealt with the shortcomings of the Machine Repair Factory that he discovered, in order to facilitate the development of criticism and self-criticism. But the Municipal Party Committee delayed again and again without handling it. We believe that the People's Daily's handling is correct, as it will allow shortcomings to be corrected quickly.

    Finally, I would like to mention my opinion on Director Wang Yang. He is loyal to the Party and the people, has a high level of political theory, and has a long revolutionary history, but his thinking is subjective, his mass viewpoint is poor, his self-criticism spirit is not enough, and some "warlordism" habits still remain. The example of him slapping the factory's lathe operator Zhang Shengtang on September 4th is one example. Therefore, the worker masses have a very bad impression of him. However, he is still enthusiastic about running the factory. In August, the situation in the factory's important link -- the foundry -- has improved, the product quality has increased by about 80%, and the general working conditions are also better than before.

                Lin

    Editor's Note: The letter from Comrade Lin, a reporter for the Xin Fushun Newspaper, proves on the one hand that the shortcomings of the Machine Repair Factory pointed out by Comrade Lu Bo are all facts, and on the other hand, points out that Comrade Lu Bo's criticism lacks a calm analysis of these shortcomings. This attitude is good. Both critics and those being criticized should deeply recognize that criticism is a positive weapon for helping and improving work, and is by no means a blow. Only under the guidance of this thinking can criticism and self-criticism be carried out correctly, and only then can the due effect be achieved.

### 读了“记者的稿件必须征得被批评者的同意吗？”以后——新抚顺报林同志来信

　　读了“记者的稿件必须征得被批评者的同意吗？”以后
    ——新抚顺报林同志来信编辑同志：
    我是新抚顺报（即前抚顺工人报）的记者。我对九月十六日人民园地上发表的鲁渤同志批评机修厂的信件，有一些意见，现提出来供你们参考。
    据我的了解，鲁渤同志所指出的机修厂的缺点确是事实；但鲁渤同志这篇稿子缺乏必要的分析。该厂浪费、损失、产品质量不高的原因，客观上是由于该厂设备破旧，机件残缺，任务紧迫；主观上是因为该厂厂长业务水平低，缺少经验，思想方法主观，不善于发动与依靠技术人员与职工群众，周密研究，克服困难。一个记者进行批评时，应当根据客观事实，加以冷静的分析和正确的估计，给被批评者指出改进工作的方向，这才是完整的批评。鲁渤同志的稿子就没有很好做到这一点。
    原来六月中旬本报曾派一个女记者到该厂了解情况，这位同志看到该厂一些缺点后，便简单地把它们罗列出来，给扣上一顶“官僚主义”的大帽子。该厂厂长汪洋就跟她发生了争吵，并给市委写了一封信（这信曾转给报社）。汪厂长对待批评的态度是很不好的，说什么“钦差大臣满天飞”、“拿跳蚤当老虎”一类的话。我们看了都不高兴，鲁渤尤为气愤。
    后来报社分配鲁渤同志去机修厂了解情况。他就去该厂把半年的工作总结要来了，并搜集了该厂的好多缺点，写成一篇文章（就是人民园地发表的那篇）。我看了这篇文章以后，曾把我的意见告诉了鲁渤，但他气愤地说：“我不管他（指汪洋厂长）怎样，反正他有缺点，我就给他写出来”（大意如此）。很明显，这种批评态度，是不够正确的。
    但是抚顺市委宣传部对于鲁渤这篇文章的处理也不妥当。他们既不同意发表鲁渤的稿件，就该对他所发现的机修厂的缺点，迅速进行调查处理，以利于批评和自我批评的开展。但市委一拖再拖，不加处理。我们认为人民日报的处置是对的，这样会使缺点很快得到纠正。
    最后，我再提一下我对汪洋厂长的意见。他对党对人民是忠诚的，政治理论水平较高，革命历史较长，但是思想主观，群众观点差，自我批评精神不够，尚残留一些“军阀主义”习气。九月四日他曾掌掴该厂车工张升堂便是一个例子。因此，工人群众对他的印象很坏。不过他还是热心的搞工厂，八月份该厂重要环节——铸造场——的情况已见好转，产品质量已提高百分之八十左右，一般工作情况也比以前好些。
                林
    编者按：新抚顺报记者林同志的来信，一方面证明鲁渤同志所指出的机修厂的缺点都是事实，另一方面又指出鲁渤同志的批评缺乏对于此等缺点的冷静的分析。这种态度是好的。无论批评者或被批评者都应该深刻认识批评是一种积极的帮助与改进工作的武器，而绝不是一种打击。只有在这种思想的指导下进行批评和自我批评，才能端正批评和自我批评的态度，才能收得应有的效果。
