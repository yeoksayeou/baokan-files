    Farmers are actively preparing to plant wheat
    Henan Provincial People's Government loans out 100 million jin of wheat seeds
    [Report from Baoding] Farmers in various counties of Hebei are combining autumn harvesting with plowing and harrowing wheat fields, preparing wheat seeds, and accumulating and transporting manure to prepare for wheat planting. Suining County began autumn harvesting in mid-August, and by early September, sorghum and millet had been completely harvested. Of the county's 100,090 mu of grain fields, more than 88,000 mu have been plowed once; of the 111,100 mu of sorghum fields, more than 25,000 mu have been plowed once, and some have been plowed twice. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient manpower and animal power, the county paid attention to mobilizing men and women with full and semi-labor power to participate in production, and organizing labor mutual aid to improve labor efficiency. According to incomplete statistics from 25 villages in the first district, a total of 330 mutual aid groups have been organized, with 888 households and 2,181 people participating. Under the slogan of "Women threshing and picking up odd jobs, freeing up men to transport manure, plow and harrow the land," more than 45,900 women in the county participated in the autumn harvest, accounting for 90 percent of the county's 51,000 women with full and semi-labor power. Farmers in the fifth district of Anguo County are plowing the land while harvesting the autumn crops. The wheat fields in 14 villages including Beizhanggezhuang have all been plowed and harrowed, and most of them have been manured. Dacheng Village in the fifth district of Zaoqiang, learning from the lessons of this summer's wheat harvest (those who plowed deeply and applied more fertilizer harvested more, and those who planted wheat during the Autumn Equinox harvested more), paid attention to deep plowing and applying more fertilizer. Many households transported manure to the fields before the crops were ripe. Currently, 280 households in the village have transported manure to the fields, and most of the 320 households in the village can guarantee planting wheat during the Autumn Equinox.
    Most areas of Hebei Province are very suitable for planting wheat and cotton. In order to lay the foundation for increasing cotton production next year and overcome the contradiction between planting wheat and planting cotton, in leading the wheat planting preparation work, counties, in addition to paying attention to deep plowing, applying more fertilizer, exchanging improved varieties, disinfecting with warm water, and issuing seed loans, also paid attention to selecting and reserving cotton fields for next year. Qiu County, Longyao County and other counties put forward the slogan "Wheat planting obeys cotton planting," and systematically guided farmers to select and reserve sufficient cotton fields. For example, Longyao County has a total of more than 885,000 mu of cultivated land, and planted 150,000 mu of cotton this year, and plans to increase it by 50,000 mu next year. Qiu County, due to some areas suffering from hail disasters, and some areas where farmers are not accustomed to planting cotton, the planned cotton field area next year will remain the same as this year (237,000 mu). In disaster areas and areas not accustomed to planting cotton, cotton fields will be appropriately reduced compared to this year, and more wheat will be planted to shorten the disaster period. In non-disaster areas that are accustomed to planting cotton, wheat planting will be reduced and more cotton fields will be reserved. This year, the province's 12 million mu of cotton fields generally achieved a bumper harvest, and the government's grain and cotton price policy guaranteed the interests of cotton farmers, providing favorable conditions for planned selection and retention of cotton fields and increasing the cotton planting area next year.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 16th] Farmers in various counties in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province are now actively preparing to plant wheat. Some areas in northern Shaanxi and the Linyou mountainous area have begun sowing. Since the summer harvest this year, there has been drought and no rain in some areas of Guanzhong, and some areas did not plant early autumn crops, resulting in reduced production in early autumn. In order to make up for the poor harvest, farmers in various counties, in addition to systematically reserving land needed for expanding cotton fields next year, are striving to plant wheat in all possible wheat-growing areas. Farmers in 11 counties including Weinan and Chengcheng had already prepared manure and transported it to the fields two months ago. Recently, after widespread rainfall, farmers are stepping up their efforts to plow the wheat fields. Most of the more than 20 million mu of wheat fields in Guanzhong have been plowed twice. Some places have already begun to repair harrows and select and inspect seeds. In order to promote improved varieties, the provincial Department of Agriculture has loaned 10,800 jin of Bima No. 1 and No. 2, and No. 302 wheat seeds purchased this year to 11 counties including Wugong, Baoji, Huaxian, and Lintong. For some areas in southern and northern Shaanxi that have suffered from hail disasters, it has been decided to issue 1.5 million jin of wheat loans. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Government recently issued instructions on wheat planting, specifically stating that in the Guanzhong area where land reform is about to be carried out, it is necessary to deeply and widely publicize the "whoever plants, harvests" policy to dispel any concerns that may arise and ensure that winter wheat sowing is not affected.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 16th] The Henan Provincial People's Government has loaned out 100 million jin of wheat seeds to help farmers throughout the province solve the seed shortage during autumn wheat planting. The wheat field area in Henan accounts for 70 percent of the total cultivated land area of the province. Whether wheat can be planted on time this autumn has a direct impact on the recovery and development of agricultural production in the province and the people's lives. This year, many areas in the province have suffered from disasters such as floods, droughts, and hail, resulting in a shortage of wheat seeds for many farmers; the poor peasants and farm laborers in the newly completed land reform areas this spring also lack wheat seeds due to their lack of savings. In order to help farmers solve the difficulty of lacking wheat seeds, the Henan Provincial People's Government had previously loaned out more than 7.4 billion yuan for plowing cattle and agricultural implements. This time, it has allocated 100 million jin of wheat seeds and instructed the subordinate people's governments at all levels to quickly conduct democratic discussions through farmer representative meetings, and send capable cadres to key areas to specifically guide the loan distribution work, and strive to loan all the wheat seeds to farmers before the 25th of this month so that they can be sown in time.

　　河北省及陕西关中等地
    农民积极准备种麦
    河南人民政府贷出麦种一亿斤
    【本报保定讯】河北各县农民正结合收秋，进行耕耙麦地，准备麦种、积肥送粪等种麦准备工作。肃宁县自八月中旬开始秋收，到九月初高粱、谷子已全部收割完毕。全县十万零九千余亩谷地，已有八万八千余亩耕过头遍；十一万一千余亩高粱地，耕过头遍的已有两万五千亩，个别的已耕二遍。为解决人、畜力不足的困难，该县注意了发动男女整半劳力参加生产，和组织劳动互助提高劳动效率。据一区二十五个村不完全统计，共组织了三百三十个互助组，计有八百八十八户，两千一百八十一人参加。在“妇女打场拾掇零星活，腾出男人送粪耕地耙地”的口号下，全县有四万五千九百多名妇女参加了秋收，占全县妇女整半劳力五万一千多名的百分之九十。安国县五区农民一面收秋一面耕地，北张各庄等十四村的麦地已全部耕耙过来，并大都送了粪。枣强五区大成村，接受了今夏麦收时比庄稼的教训（深耕和上粪多的收得多，秋分种的麦子收得多），都注意了深耕和多上肥料，很多户庄稼还未成熟就把粪送到地头上了。现该村已有二百八十户把粪送到地里，全村三百二十户绝大部分能保证种上秋分麦。
    河北省大部地区种植麦、棉都很适宜，为打下明年棉花增产的基础，克服种麦和种棉的矛盾，各县在领导种麦准备工作中，除注意了深耕、多施肥及调换良种、温汤消毒、发放种籽贷款等工作外，还注意了选留明年的棉田。邱县、隆尧等县提出“种麦服从种棉”的口号，有计划地领导农民选留了足够的棉田。如隆尧县共有耕地八十八万五千多亩，今年共种棉十五万亩，明年计划再增加五万亩。邱县因部分地区遭受雹灾，还有些地区农民没有种棉习惯，明年计划棉田面积仍保持今年数量（二十三万七千亩），灾区和不习惯种棉地区，棉田将较今年适当减少，多种麦子，以缩短灾期：非灾区而又习惯种棉地区，将减少种麦多留棉田。该省今年一千二百万亩棉田一般均获丰收，政府的粮棉价格政策又保障了棉农利益，给有计划的选留棉田，增加明年种棉面积，提供了有利条件。（通讯员许子真、高芝芬、程敬星、李振文）
    【新华社西安十六日电】陕西省关中各县农民，现正积极准备种麦。陕北及麟游山区部分地区，已开始播种。今年关中部分地区从夏收后，干旱无雨，部分地区晚秋没有种上，早秋因此减产。为了弥补歉收，各县农民除有计划地保留明年扩大棉田所需要的土地外，在可能种植小麦的地方，争取全部种麦。渭南、澄城等十一县农民早在两月以前，即已将粪土捣好送到地里。最近各地普遍落雨后，农民都正在加紧赶翻麦地，关中两千余万亩麦田大部都已犁过两遍。有些地方现已开始整修耙和选检种籽工作。为了推广优良品种，该省农业厅已将今年收购的一万零八百斤碧码一、二号，三○二号等麦种，贷发武功、宝鸡、华县、临潼等十一县。对陕南、陕北部分遭受雹灾地区，决定发放一百五十万斤的小麦贷款。陕西省人民政府最近发出种麦指示，特别提出：在即将进行土地改革的关中地区，必须深入普遍地宣传“谁种谁收”政策，以解除可能引起的一些顾虑，使冬麦播种不受影响。
    【新华社开封十六日电】河南省人民政府已贷出麦种一亿斤，帮助全省农民解决秋季种麦时的种籽困难。河南麦地面积占全省总耕地面积的百分之七十，今秋麦子能否全部及时下种，对于全省农业生产的恢复与发展以及人民的生活有直接影响。今年因省内不少地区遭受水、旱、雹等灾害，以致许多农民缺乏麦种；在今春新完成土地改革地区的贫农、雇农，也因素无积蓄，亦缺乏麦种。为了帮助农民解决缺乏麦种的困难，河南省人民政府前此已贷出耕牛、农具贷款七十四亿余元，这次又拨出麦种一亿斤，并指示所属各级人民政府，迅速通过农民代表会议进行民主讨论，并派得力干部深入各重点地区具体指导发贷工作，争取在本月二十五日前将全部麦种贷放到农民手里，以便及时播种。
