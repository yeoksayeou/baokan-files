　　I Have the Right to Report Work Situations to the Party Newspaper
　　Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council
　　Second District Office Ma Keqiang's Letter
　　Editor's Note: On August 28th, we received a letter from Comrade Ma Keqiang criticizing the work of the Second District Office of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council. We immediately forwarded the original to the Municipal Trade Union Council on August 30th.
　　On September 8th, we received another letter from Comrade Ma Keqiang, stating that he had been criticized by Comrade Zheng Kefeng, the section chief of the Organization Department of the Municipal Trade Union Council, for submitting a letter of criticism to this newspaper. We now publish Comrade Ma Keqiang's two letters below.

　　Comrade Ma Keqiang's Opinions on the Second District Office of the Municipal Trade Union Council Editor Comrades:
　　Over the past year, the Second District Office of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council has made achievements; however, there are still some problems hindering the progress of the work. Now, I will tell you simply and concisely, hoping you can help solve them.
　　In terms of work, it can be said that the Second District Office has not thoroughly checked its own work, nor has it reported the work of the unit to everyone. There are many meetings, but they do not solve problems. The instructions for the activities of the Communist Youth League branch have been delayed for more than a month. The summaries of some groups are often submitted ten days late. The three-day work brief is also not submitted. In the industrial group, there is not a single factory that can conduct production competitions. Problems are handled in a handicraft-like manner, dragging on and on. For example, when registering unemployed workers, only ten or so people are registered a day, but six cadres are used.
　　Looseness is also manifested in learning. In the morning, everyone only studies for an hour and then disperses. The Trade Union Law has not been fully studied to this day. Discipline is not strict. Some comrades are often late, but no one urges them; some comrades even stay out overnight at will.
　　The work morale of the cadres is generally very poor. Everyone is waiting for rectification. Some comrades are in a bad mood. Therefore, few comrades can truly go down to work. As a result, the work cannot be promoted.
　　I hope to forward the above situation to our district committee or the Municipal Trade Union Council so that the problems can be solved as soon as possible.
　　Ma Keqiang
　　(We have already forwarded Comrade Ma Keqiang's original letter to the Municipal Trade Union Council for processing. This letter was rewritten by Comrade Ma at our request based on the original letter – Editor)

　　Comrade Ma Keqiang's Second Letter Editor Comrades:
　　Some time ago, I reported some shortcomings in the work of the Second District Office of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council to the Party newspaper, hoping that you would forward them to the relevant departments to solve the problem quickly so that the work would not be affected.
　　Today, Comrade Zheng Kefeng, the section chief of the Organization Department of the Beijing Municipal Trade Union Council, called me in. There, I saw the letter you forwarded. After I told him about the recent situation of the office, he said: "The Municipal Trade Union Council is about to find a way to solve the internal affairs of the Second District Office. You should raise your opinions through the organizational system and should not submit articles to the newspaper; if you have any opinions, you can talk to Comrade Xiao Ming" (paraphrased). At that time, I thought to myself: Since I am a member of the Communist Youth League, I should examine myself if I have shortcomings. But my purpose in writing to the Party newspaper was to solve the problem quickly and improve the work of our unit.
　　After studying the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on unfolding criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals and the "Is it in accordance with organizational discipline for Communist Party members to raise criticisms and suggestions to the Party newspaper regarding the work of the government?" in the People's Daily People's Mailbox on July 18th, I realized that my reporting the situation to the Party newspaper is loyal to the revolutionary cause, and I reported the situation to the Party newspaper after the superior Party, League, and administrative authorities knew about it. I don't think I did anything wrong.
　　Therefore, I believe that Comrade Zheng of the Municipal Trade Union Council's act of calling me in for criticism is not in line with the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's decision on unfolding criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals. Obviously, this is an act of suppressing readers from reporting situations to the Party newspaper.
　　Ma Keqiang

　　我有权利向党报反映工作情况
    京市总工会
    二区办事处  马克强来信
    编者按：八月二十八日，我们接到马克强同志批评北京市总工会第二区办事处工作的信，我们即于八月三十日将原件转送市总工会。
    九月八日，我们又接到马克强同志的信，说他因前次将批评信投给本报而受到市总工会组织部干部科长郑克风同志的批评。现将马克强同志的两次来信发表于后。
    马克强同志对市总工会第二区办事处的意见编辑同志：
    一年来北京市总工会第二区办事处的工作是有成绩的；但是还有一些问题，阻碍着工作的开展。现在，我简单扼要的告诉你们，希望你们帮助解决。
    工作方面，二区办事处可以说没有很好的检查过自己的工作，也没有向大家报告本单位的工作。开会很多，但不解决问题。对团支部的活动的指示，拖了一个多月还没作出来。某些组的总结往往晚交十天。三日工作书面简报也不交。在产业组，没有一个厂子可以搞生产竞赛的。用手工业的方式处理问题，拖拖拉拉，如登记失业工人时一天才登记十余人，但用了六个干部。
    学习方面也表现松散的现象。早晨，大家只学习一个钟头就散了。工会法到今天还没学完。纪律不严，有的同志往往迟到，但没人去督促；有的同志竟随便外宿。
    干部的工作情绪多很不好，大家等着整干。有的同志闹情绪，因此，真正能下去工作的同志很少。工作也就推不动了。
    希望把以上这些情况转告我区区委或总工会，以便快些解决问题。
    马克强
    （马克强同志的原信，我们已经转给市总工会处理。这封信是我们请马同志根据前信原意重写的——编者）
    马克强同志二次来信编辑同志：
    前些日子我向党报反映了北京市总工会第二区办事处的一些工作缺点，并希望你们转给有关部门快点解决这个问题，不叫工作受到损失。
    今天北京市总工会组织部干部科长郑克风同志把我叫去了。在他那里我看见了你们转去的信。我对他谈了关于办事处的最近情况以后，他说：“关于二区办事处内部的事，总工会正要设法解决，你应该按组织系统提意见，不应该往报上投稿子；倘有什么意见，找萧明同志谈也可以”（大意）。当时我心里想：我自己既是一个团员，本身有缺点就应该检讨。但我给党报写稿的目的，是为了快一点解决问题，改进本单位的工作。
    在我学习了中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定和七月十八日人民日报人民信箱“共产党员向党报提出对政府工作的批评和建议是否合于组织纪律”二文件以后，认识我向党报反映情况是忠于革命事业的，并且我是在上级党、团、和行政知道了以后才向党报反映情况的。我觉得我没有作错。
    因此，我认为市总工会郑同志把我叫去批评的行为，是与中共中央关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定的精神不相符合的，显然这是压制读者向党报反映情况的行为。
    马克强
