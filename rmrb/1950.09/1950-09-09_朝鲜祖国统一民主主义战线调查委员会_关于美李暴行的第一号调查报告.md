　　On July 14, 1950, after the Central Standing Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland organized this investigation committee, headed by Supreme People's Assembly Chairman He Xian, based on fully investigated facts, it reached the indisputable conclusion that the American armed interventionists, in order to forcibly turn our country into its colony and enslave our people, were brutally violating international regulations and the principles of humanitarianism, and were adopting cruel methods of conducting war.

　　As the American interventionists' intervention in Korea fails, they are becoming more and more vicious in their war against the Korean people, attempting to weaken our people's fighting spirit and confidence in victory.

　　The American plunderers believe that, with the help of many pro-American factions on the Security Council – who, in violation of the UN Charter and under the direction of the United States, stamped their seals on the resolution recognizing the aggression against Korea – they can legitimize the bestial massacres being carried out by the United States in Korea. But the American colonialists must know that the Korean people will never tolerate the bloody barbarism they are carrying out on Korean territory, nor will they allow them to unjustifiably infringe upon the rights of the Korean people and kill our children and parents.

  手持杀人武器侵入我国的美国干涉者，正受到全体朝鲜人民为拥护自己祖国的自由、独立而奋起的决定性的抵抗。
  美国干涉者随着自己干涉朝鲜的失败，就愈加凶恶地进行反对朝鲜人民的战争，企图削弱我们人民的斗志和对胜利的信心。
  美国掠夺者以为：在那些安全理事会许多亲美派的帮助下——他们违反联合国宪章，受美国的指示，在承认侵略朝鲜的决议上盖章，能使美国在朝鲜进行的兽性屠杀合法化。但美国殖民者们必须知道：朝鲜人民决不能忍受他们在朝鲜领土上所采取的流血的蛮行，更不能容许他们无理侵犯朝鲜人民的权利及杀害我们的儿女和父母。
  朝鲜人民永远不会忘记美国侵略者给朝鲜人民带来的未曾有过的灾难，并将加强对它的憎恨。
  我们确信：朝鲜人民对美国干涉者蛮行的愤恨，将获得全世界一切善良人士的同情。美国干涉者及其帮凶们决不能摆脱由于他们进行的流血蛮行而招致的责任。
