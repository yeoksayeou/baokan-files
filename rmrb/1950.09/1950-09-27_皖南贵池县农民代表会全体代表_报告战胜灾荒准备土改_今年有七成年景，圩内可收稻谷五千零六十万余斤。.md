[Reported by this newspaper] All representatives of the Third Farmers' Representative Conference of Guichi County, Southern Anhui Province, wrote to Chairman Mao to report on the situation of the county's efforts under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the joint efforts of the masses to overcome the winter famine and the successful fight against the floods and droughts this year, and to request instructions on the direction of future efforts. The letter stated: Respected Chairman Mao:

Under your wise leadership, on April 21st of last year, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River and liberated the vast lands and people of southern Jiangsu. The people of our entire county celebrated this unprecedented great victory with twelve thousand points of joy. Guichi is a county town located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, with 290 administrative villages, a population of over 300,000, and over 500,000 mu of farmland. It is known as a land of fish and rice, producing fish, rice, bamboo, wood, charcoal, tea mountain tung trees, and other natural materials. However, due to the destruction and sabotage by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the people suffered greatly. In particular, they only cared about their anti-people war and neglected the maintenance of the river and embankment projects along the Yangtze River, causing our county's polder fields to suffer from unprecedented floods for two consecutive years, making the lives of the masses even more difficult.

However, in just over a year since liberation, thanks to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the conscientious responsibility of the staff of governments at all levels, our farmers have taken a step forward politically and economically. We heard the county head's work report at each representative meeting, so we know that the government has done a lot for us. At the same time, it has made us more clearly aware of how the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government led us to successfully overcome the difficulties in the face of such a serious disaster, so that we all sincerely thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.

Last winter, the disaster situation in our county was severe, with as many as 85,000 refugees in the county. With the joint efforts of the Party, government, army, and people of the county, production self-rescue, mutual assistance, and mutual aid were fully launched in 1950. The government also used work-for-relief to help overcome the famine, which had a great effect. Taking dike repair and embankment restoration as an example: a total of 17 key embankments were repaired in the county, using 1,530,000 man-days and 1,630,943 cubic meters of earthwork. 3,400,190 jin of public grain rice was spent, saving 557,272 jin of rice from the 25% reserve grain in the original budget. The above-mentioned key embankments were all completed by layering and ramming earth under the automatic and mutually challenging competition of the masses. This was a large project unprecedented in Guichi, which safely protected 99,060 mu of polder fields and 106,232 mu of polder land. Since the beginning of summer, the cadres have led the polder residents to carry out dike protection and flood prevention work. The government subsidized more than 170,000 jin of rice for flood prevention materials. The masses vigorously raised thatch and small wood, actively carried out wave blocking, flood prevention, digging reserve soil, and making earth cattle, and patrolled in shifts day and night. Therefore, all the embankments in the county safely passed the flood season this year. At present, the flood prevention work has basically come to an end, and most of the rice in the embankments has been harvested. This year is a 70% harvest year, and it is estimated that more than 50,068,600 jin of rice can be harvested in the embankments (calculated at 350 jin per mu of paddy field and 150 jin per mu of dry land).

Since the beginning of summer this year, there has been little rain, and some areas of our county have been threatened by drought. However, with the joint efforts of the Party, government, army, and people, drought resistance and seedling protection, water extraction, and the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects have also solved many problems. The government lent more than 62.67 million yuan in RMB, added 107 waterwheels, repaired 229 dams and weirs, and repaired 90 ponds and embankments, benefiting 15,417 mu of farmland, which can increase production by 393,575 jin. After the heavy rain on August 18, the masses vigorously rushed to plant late-harvest crops and vegetables, making up for part of the losses caused by the drought.

The government has lent a total of 1,513,000 jin of various production loans and 1,011,859 jin of relief grain. The masses have borrowed more than 360,000 jin of grain from each other. Last year, the rent reduction was implemented, reaching more than 1 million jin in the county. At present, the disaster has been successfully overcome in the county, and preparations are being made for the autumn harvest, checking and rectifying the land, in order to complete the collection task, ensure military and civilian use, vigorously support the Liberation War, quickly liberate Taiwan, liberate the whole of China, and completely eliminate the Kuomintang's remaining armed forces. The farmers of our county have been exploited and oppressed by the landlord class and feudal forces for many years through high rents and high profits, and they are eager for land reform. At present, the masses and cadres are enthusiastically studying the land reform documents, and they want to complete the land reform this winter and next spring in order to restore and develop production. Today, Luo Guangming, a model worker of our county's farmers, has emerged to participate in the National Model Worker Representative Conference. We hope to receive instructions on the direction of future efforts. We wish you good health!

Initiated by all representatives of the Third Farmers' Representative Conference of Guichi County.

　　皖南贵池县农民代表会全体代表
    报告战胜灾荒准备土改
    今年有七成年景，圩内可收稻谷五千零六十万余斤。
    【本报讯】皖南贵池县第三届农民代表会全体代表，上书毛主席，报告该县解放后一年多以来，在共产党、人民政府领导及群众一体的努力下，度过去冬灾荒、胜利战胜今年水旱灾荒的情形，并请示今后努力的方向。该函称：敬爱的毛主席：
    在您的英明领导下，去年四月二十一日解放大军横渡长江，解放了江南的广大土地和人民，我全县的人民都以十二万分的高兴庆祝这史无前例的伟大胜利。贵池是位于长江南岸的一个县城，全县有二百九十个行政村、三十多万人口、五十余万亩田地，向称鱼米之乡，出产品有鱼、米、竹木、柴炭、茶山桐子等，天然的物质条件很好；但因国民党反动派百般的摧残破坏、人民受到了莫大的痛苦，尤其是他们只顾了他们的反人民的战争，对长江沿岸的江河堤岸工程失修，致使我全县圩田连遭了两年空前未有的大水灾，群众生活更是困难。
    但是，解放后才一年多的工夫，由于中国共产党的正确领导，及各级人民政府的工作人员的认真负责，我们农民们从政治上、经济上都提高了一步。我们在每次的代表会上都听到县长的工作报告，所以知道政府是给我们作了很多的事情，同时也使我们更明确的认识了中国共产党和人民政府，在我们面临着这样严重的灾荒下，如何领导我们胜利的度过了难关，使我们大家由衷地感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党。
    去年冬天，我县一度的灾情严重，全县难民达八万五千人之多，在我全县党、政、军、民共同的努力下，于一九五○年全面的展开了生产自救，互助互济。政府又以工代赈协助度过灾荒，收到很大效果。仅以修堤复圩来说：全县共修了十七个重点圩，用了一百五十三万个人工，修了一百六十三万零九百四十三公方土。开支公粮米三百四十万零一千九百一十斤，在原预算百分之二十五的预备粮中节余了五十五万七千二百七十二斤米以上重点圩并且都是层土层夯出于群众的自动，互相挑战的竞赛下完成了贵池从未所闻的大工程，使圩田九万九千零六十亩，圩地一十万零六千二百三十二亩得到安全的保护。入夏以来，干部又领导圩内的圩民进行了护堤防汛工作，政府补助了防汛材料米十七万余斤，群众大力筹借了毛草、小木，并积极的进行挡浪、防汛、挑预备土、打土牛，日夜轮流巡逻，因之，今年全县各圩都安全的度过了汛期。目前防汛工作已基本上告一结束，圩内大部分稻谷已收割，今年有七成年景，估计圩内可收到五千零六十万八千六百斤稻谷（田按三百五十斤计算，地按一百五十斤计算）。
    今年入夏以来，雨水很少，我县部分地区受到了旱灾的威胁，但在党政军民的共同努力下，实行了抗旱保苗、拨工戽水、兴修小型水利，也解决了不少问题。政府贷出了人民币六千二百六十七万余元，添置了水车一百零七具，修好坝塥二百二十九处，修好塘堰九十处，受益田亩一万五千四百一十七亩，可增加产量三十九万三千五百七十五斤。八月十八日大雨后，群众大力抢种晚收作物及蔬菜，弥补了部分旱灾的损失。
    政府共贷出了各种生产贷粮一百五十一万三千斤、救济粮一百零一万一千八百五十九斤，群众互借粮三十六万余斤，去年执行减租，全县即达一百余万斤。目前全县灾荒已胜利的度过去了，正在作好秋征的准备工作，查整田地，以期完成征收任务，保证军需民用，大力支援解放战争，迅速的解放台湾，解放全中国，彻底的消灭国民党残余武装。我们全县的农民是受了地主阶级、封建势力多年来的高租大利剥削压迫，渴望土改，现在群众及干部正在热心的学习土改文件，要在今冬明春完成土改，以便恢复和发展生产。今天涌现了我县农民劳动模范罗光明同志参加全国劳模代表会议，希指示今后努力的方向。并祝身体健康！
