[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The labor model representatives from various public and private factories, enterprises, industries, and cultural and educational organizations in Beijing, 145 people in total, jointly telegraphed the United Nations Security Council, demanding the swift sanctioning of US imperialist acts of aggression. The text is as follows:

To Mr. Jebb, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General:

On June 27th, the US government President Truman issued a statement openly sending the Seventh Fleet to invade our country's Taiwan, attempting to prevent our army from liberating Taiwan. Following this, on August 27th and 29th, US invading air forces from the Korean War continuously intruded into our country's Northeast airspace, killing and wounding our people. We, the labor model representatives of Beijing, express extraordinary anger and hatred towards this shameless and barbaric act of armed aggression and provocation of war by the United States. We firmly support the serious protest lodged by our country's Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to the US government and the accusations made to the United Nations. We demand that the United Nations swiftly sanction the US government's acts of aggression, immediately withdraw US troops invading Taiwan and Korea, to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world.

Liu Dezhen, Cao Xianbo, Li Shuhe, Zhang Fengquan, Hou Deyuan, Hu Quangui, Wang Zhonghe, and 138 other labor model representatives from various public and private factories, enterprises, industries, and cultural and educational organizations in Beijing.
