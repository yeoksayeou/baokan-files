Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 18th: A comprehensive TASS dispatch reports: The Third Congress of the International Association of Journalists continued its sessions on the 16th. Representatives of the German Democratic Republic and progressive newspapers of West Germany have arrived. The number of representatives attending the congress has now reached sixty, representing thirty countries.

　　Polish representative, Grodezdeski, delivered a report at the meeting on the task of newspapers fighting for peace. He pointed out that newspapers now face a particularly important task of striving for peace and exposing warmongers. Newspapers must help mobilize the people of all countries to fight for peace and must demonstrate the invincible strength of the people of all countries' determination to strive for peace.

　　In the afternoon session on the 16th, the congress discussed the Polish representative's report. Soviet representative, Bourkov, emphasized that progressive newspapers in all countries have a responsibility to openly, sincerely, and truthfully tell all the people about the new war danger being prepared by American imperialism, and to use all methods to fight against war preparations and strive for peace.

　　French representative, Cohen, emphasized that the progressive forces of the French people will continue to stand at the forefront of the peace camp.

　　Representatives from the People's Democratic countries of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania all described the peace-building work and the struggle for peace that is currently underway in their countries, as well as the true freedom of the press in these countries. All speakers expressed their strong confidence that peace-supporters will be able to crush the plans of the new war instigators.

　　Nguyen Van Hong (transliteration), the representative of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, emphatically declared in his speech that the fraternal unity of all peoples is more powerful than the atomic bomb.

　　Wu Wentao, the representative of the People's Republic of China, spoke about the great role played by Chinese democratic journalists in the victorious struggle of the Chinese people and in the great construction work that the Chinese people are now engaged in.

　　Secretary-General of the International Association of Journalists, Hranek, then read a letter from the famous American journalist, Kahn, who was unable to attend the congress because the U.S. authorities refused to issue him a passport. In his letter, he emphasized that American newspapers, which have close ties with monopoly capital, are using every means to carry out deceptive propaganda for war preparation. However, more and more Americans are realizing that warmongers are pushing them into an abyss. American youth do not want to fight against the Korean people. In San Francisco, 37 out of 70 people conscripted for the Korean War did not report for duty, while in New York and Los Angeles, 25 percent of those conscripted did not report. Despite the frantic war propaganda, the American peace movement is growing, and more and more people are signing the peace declaration. Kahn concluded by declaring: We, these American progressive journalists who have dedicated our lives to peace, extend our heartfelt congratulations to the Congress and wish it complete success.

　　The delegates to the Congress warmly welcomed the speech by Ki Seok-bok, the head of the delegation from Korea. He emphasized that the liberation struggle of the Korean people is part of the worldwide struggle of the peoples of all countries for peace and democracy.

　　The Congress unanimously approved the acceptance of the journalists' organizations of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as members of the International Association of Journalists.
