　　Broad Masses of Workers Across the Country Greet National Day with Gifts
    Striving to Fulfill Production and Improve Quality

    [Report from this newspaper] To welcome the first National Day of the new China, a competition has been launched encompassing large, medium, and small cities in major administrative regions. In Northeast China, cities like Shenyang, Harbin, Qiqihar, and Yingkou have already seen many factories creating impressive achievements in the competition. For example, the construction work at the Shenyang Glass Factory was administratively planned for three months, but the workers are preparing to complete it in two months. Other units, such as Rubber Factory No. 4 and the Baizong Clothing Factory, are also enthusiastically engaging in the competition. In Harbin, the competition movement in various factories has become a mass movement, from which many model deeds and heroic figures have emerged. At the Shuanghesheng Flour Mill, under the slogan "Everything for the National Day gift," veteran worker Ren Shumao improved the equipment and produced 5,154 bags of flour in 24 hours, breaking the original budget of 4,500 bags while also improving quality. In Qiqihar, workers in various factories proposed to improve quality and reduce costs in the competition. For example, technician Wang Gengxu of the Ceramics Factory experimented with using acidified soil, clay, and grey clay after firing to make batteries and high-voltage lines, and has now successfully trial-produced them. This is a significant contribution to the development of the North Manchuria Electric Power Industry. Other factories such as Jianhua, Nenjiang Match Factory, Nenjiang Textile Factory, and Supply Factory are also launching production competitions. Yingkou City convened a joint meeting of grassroots trade unions on September 16, calling on workers to use production competitions to welcome National Day. Northeast Fifth Textile Factory, Cigarette Factory, Shipyard, Knitting Factory, and other units have also put forward guarantees tailored to their specific conditions. Among them, the Northeast Fifth Textile Factory guaranteed to complete the September production plan as a National Day gift.
    The Mudanjiang Electric Power Bureau Power Plant launched a long-term production competition on August 1 to further implement the production responsibility system, eliminate accidents, and achieve safe power supply. The Jingbo Lake Hydroelectric Power Plant challenged the Mudanjiang Power Plant and proposed to strive for zero accidents in a year. Currently, in order to further advance the competition, the Electric Power Trade Union is promoting the advanced experience of the Ma Hengchang小组 (Ma Hengchang Group) and preparing to create a typical Ma Hengchang-style group as a National Day gift. In addition, the Tashan Power Plant in Rehe Province proposed to increase production to welcome National Day. Northeast Fourth Textile Factory aimed to complete the September production task ahead of schedule as a National Day gift. For example, the weaving workshop proposed to guarantee completion of the task two days ahead of schedule, increase the first-grade cloth rate to 98.5%, and reduce the third and fourth-grade cloth by 10%. Other workshops also made similar guarantees. Furthermore, the factory's spinning output in the first half of September reached 1,701.12 pieces, 105.5% of the original plan, and weaving reached 29,230 bolts, 105.9% of the original plan. There are many other similar examples.
    Other enterprises such as Harbin Chicken and Duck Company, Shiye Company Glass Factory, Andong Paper Mill, Sujiatun Fried Wheel Factory, Liaodong Province Yingguanghua Chemical Factory, Jilin Chemical Factory, and the Material Factory of the Finance Department of the Northeast People's Government also launched National Day gift campaigns, guaranteeing to complete production plans ahead of schedule. Among them, Jilin Chemical Factory proposed to exceed the annual task by 40% for calcium carbide, 50% for lime, 36% for yellow phosphorus, and 10% for construction in the next three months.
    In the Fengfeng Mining Area of Hebei Province, state-owned, public-private joint ventures, and private factories and mines successively launched innovation record movements in September, among which the innovation record movement of the Fengfeng State-owned Coal Mine Repair Factory has already achieved significant results. Workers from units such as the steelmaking department of Tangshan Steel Plant, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, and Tangshan Power Plant are also taking practical actions to welcome National Day and creating production achievements as National Day gifts. Since the Tianjin Steel Plant challenged the Zhongfang No. 3 Factory and the Electric Industry No. 2 Factory on September 11, the output of steel ingots has increased by 370%, wire rod has increased by 24%, and steel bars have increased by 38%, with improvements in quality. The workers of the No. 3 Power Plant under the Tianjin Electric Power Bureau have achieved "safe power transmission without a single accident of responsibility." Workers at the Tianjin Central Electrical Equipment No. 2 Manufacturing Factory reduced the manufacturing time of transformer oil tanks from 60 hours to 37 hours and the renovation time of motors from 34 hours to 31 hours, creating a national record. In addition, workers at the Tianjin Automobile Assembly Factory renovated a "National Day" motorcycle in 15 days. Workers at the Tianjin Haihe Engineering Office renovated a "National Day" large fishing boat. Wuhan Jiji Hydropower Plant and E’nan Wuchang Power Plant are also using reducing coal consumption rate as the main goal of the competition. The Northwest Automobile Repair Factory in Gansu Province is currently collecting waste materials and preparing to repair 48 broken and abandoned vehicles that have been parked for more than three years as a gift for National Day. All workers of the Yinchuan Xinhua Paper Mill in Ningxia also guaranteed to improve product quality, quantity, and save raw materials in the competition; and challenged other factories. The Qingdao Sifang Railway Factory has completed the annual production task of wrought iron ahead of schedule. The Automobile Repair Factory of the Logistics Department of the Fourth Field Army in Wuhan overfulfilled the two-month competition goal in August. Zhang Shibao, a labor model from Shanghai Electric Power Company, called on 1,400 workers in the power plant to repair boilers No. 30 and No. 29, and coal grinder No. 4 as a National Day gift.
