Over Ten Thousand Village Cadres in Zhejiang Participate in Rotational Training for Rectification
[This Newspaper News] According to the Zhejiang Daily, over ten thousand village cadres in Zhejiang Province are participating in rotational training in various counties for rectification. After the rotational training, they will participate in the autumn grain collection and land reform movement. Most of the trainees are township-level cadres, and a small number of peasant activists. Among the township-level cadres, most are newly appointed cadres, with generally low levels of education. These cadres have a high enthusiasm for learning, but in terms of ideology, they generally have ideological concerns and incorrect ideas, such as fearing "being transferred away from their hometown after studying," fearing being punished, or thinking that "it will be difficult to work if we can't use coercive orders in the future," and so on.
Based on the above situation, the educational content and steps taken by each county are roughly as follows:
First, conduct in-depth mobilization to stabilize learning emotions and establish correct learning attitudes. In most counties, responsible cadres make mobilization reports, explaining to the trainees that the purpose of rectification is to transform old ideas and old work styles, improve political awareness and policy level, in order to welcome land reform; and expose bandit and special agent rumors to dispel their ideological concerns.
After the trainees' emotions are generally stabilized, the leadership immediately conducted current affairs education and class education. The main purpose of current affairs education is to guide the trainees to correctly estimate the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the strength of the world's democratic camp, and to use comparative methods to illustrate the superficial strength of American imperialism, and to show that we have the full strength to liberate Taiwan, etc.; to strengthen the trainees' confidence in victory and establish the idea of production and construction.
After the current affairs study, it turns to rectification. In the rectification, each county generally adopts the method of summarizing work: First, the responsible comrades of the county make an analytical and critical enlightening summary report, exposing the bureaucratic and commandist work style in the work, and repeatedly explain the purpose and attitude of the rectification, requiring the trainees to correctly estimate the achievements and advantages on the one hand, and criticize the errors and shortcomings on the other when summarizing the work. Then, unfold the discussion and conduct self-criticism. According to the review of township cadres in Linpu and Chenbei districts of Xiaoshan County training class, the main shortcomings are two: First, lack of policy concept, lack of legal concept, and commandist work style; Second, selfishness, eagerness to gain victory fruits, unstable positions, and acceptance of landlord bribes, etc. In the rectification, most of the trainees in various places can make relatively deep revelations. When checking, each county generally used the method of typical demonstration: praising good typical examples to establish uprightness and make trainees learn from their strengths; analyzing and criticizing bad typical examples to recognize their harm, study the causes of shortcomings, and find out the methods to correct them in the future. The method of typical demonstration has been regarded as one of the most important and effective methods by various counties, and has been widely used in various counties.
In the previous stage of learning in various places, there are the following gains. 1. Initially recognized the power of the people and the superficial strength of the reactionaries, and had the ability to criticize the rumors of bandits and special agents. 2. Initially established a sense of responsibility as masters of the country and a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people. And realized that in order to serve the people well, it is necessary to transform their own ideology and work style. 3. Recognized the harm of commandist work style to work. In the study, some trainees requested to review their mistakes in public, so that they could be transformed and educate everyone.
The shortcomings in learning are, first of all, that the leadership does not pay enough attention to it. The county party committees of some counties did not do it themselves, the report preparation was not sufficient, or it was not specific enough, and the problems could not be solved. In the learning process, they also failed to grasp the ideological situation of the trainees and correct the deviations in time. Some of them used weaker cadres to lead the training class, so that they could not give timely and satisfactory answers to the questions raised by the trainees. The second is that the ideological problems of the trainees have not been thoroughly solved. For example, some people still have family concerns, some people still have complacency, a small number of trainees still have unclear understanding of the current situation, or feel that they "have no wind to rectify" and are not motivated to learn. The third is that there is a deviation in the discussion that fails to grasp the key points. Finally, the analysis and criticism of typical examples is not comprehensive enough, some only talk about the good side, and some only talk about the shortcomings.
The learning time of training classes in various counties is generally about fifteen days. The first phase will be completed in early September. The second phase will begin at the end of September.

### 浙江万余乡村干部参加轮训进行整风

　　浙江万余乡村干部参加轮训进行整风
    【本报讯】据浙江日报消息：浙江省万余乡村干部分别在各县参加轮训，进行整风。轮训完毕后将参加秋征工作及土地改革运动。学员大部为乡级干部，及少数农民积极分子。乡级干部中，大部分是新参加工作的干部；文化程度一般不高。这些干部要求学习的情绪很高，但在思想方面，大都存在思想顾虑和错误观念，如怕“学习后调走，远离家乡”，怕受处分，或认为“今后不能用强迫命令，工作就难作了”等等。
    根据以上情况，各县所进行的教育内容与步骤大致如下：
    首先深入动员，安定学习情绪，树立正确的学习态度。各县多是由负责干部做动员报告，向学员说明整风的目的是为了改造旧思想旧作风，提高政治觉悟和政策水平，以便迎接土地改革；并揭破匪特谣言，解除其思想顾虑。
    待学员情绪大体安定后，领导上随即进行了时事教育与阶级教育。时事教育主要是引导学员正确地估计中国人民革命的伟大胜利，及世界民主阵营的力量的强大，用对比方法，说明美帝的外强中干，说明我们完全有力量解放台湾等；坚定学员的胜利信心，树立生产建设的思想。
    时事学习之后，即转入整风。各县在整风中一般都是采用总结工作的方法：首先由县的负责同志作一有分析有批判的启发性的总结报告，揭发工作中的官僚主义和命令主义作风，并反复说明整风的目的和态度，要求学员总结工作时，要一方面正确估计成绩与优点，一方面批判错误和缺点。然后展开讨论，进行自我检讨。根据萧山县训练班临浦、城北两区乡干部的检讨来看，主要缺点有二：第一、缺乏政策观念，缺乏守法观念，和强迫命令作风；第二，自私自利，多得胜利果实，和立场不稳，接受地主贿赂等。各地学员在整风中，大部均能做到较深刻的揭发。各县在检查时，一般都运用了典型示范的方法：表扬好的典型，树立正气，使学员学习他的长处；分析批判坏的典型，认清其危害，研究产生缺点的原因，找出今后纠正的办法。典型示范的方法已被各县认为是最重要、最有效的办法之一，已在各县普遍运用。
    各地在上一阶段学习中，有如下几点收获。一、初步认识了人民力量的强大，认识了反动派的外强中干，对匪特的谣言，有了批判能力。二、初步树立了国家主人翁的责任感和为人民服务的革命人生观。并认识到要想很好地为人民服务，必须改造好自己的思想作风。三、认识了强迫命令作风对工作的危害。在学习中，有的学员要求将自己的错误当众检讨，使自己得到改造也教育了大家。
    学习中的缺点，首先是领导上重视不够。有的县党委没有亲自动手，报告准备不充分，或不具体，不能解决问题。学习中也未能掌握学员思想情况，及时纠正偏向。有的就因为以较弱的干部领导训练班，以致对学员提出的问题，不能作及时的完满的答复。其次是解决学员的思想问题尚不够彻底。如有人仍有家庭顾虑，有人还有自满情绪，少数学员对目前形势仍然认识不清，或觉得自己“无风可整”，学习不起劲。再次是讨论中有抓不住重点的偏向。最后是分析批判典型尚不够全面，有的只谈好的一面，有的只谈缺点。
    各县训练班学习时间一般多为十五天左右。第一期于九月上旬即可结束。第二期九月底开始。
