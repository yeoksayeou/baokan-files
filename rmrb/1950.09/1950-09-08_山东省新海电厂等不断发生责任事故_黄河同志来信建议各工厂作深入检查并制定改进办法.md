Comrade Editor:

　　In August, some state-owned factories in Xinhailian City, Shandong Province, experienced continuous accidents due to negligence regarding safety in production, resulting in the loss of a large amount of state property.

　　At the Xin Hai Power Plant, due to serious bureaucratic work styles of the leadership and technicians such as Zhang Duoqi and Zhang Huasong, a 500 kVA transformer was burned out during repairs in late June, resulting in a loss equivalent to over 30,000 catties of wheat. After this incident occurred, the plant's leadership did not investigate responsibility, nor did they effectively research methods to eliminate accidents. On the 11th of this month, another 500 kVA transformer at the Sunjiashan Substation was burned down, causing the Lianyungang dredger to stop working for two months. The plant's losses in repairs and other expenses were estimated at 4,524 catties of wheat. The losses of various factories during the power outage were incalculable.

　　When the Huaxing Iron Factory was casting ridge rollers for the Dongxin Farm, the estimated amount of scrap iron was insufficient. The first casting required 600 catties, but only 400 catties of iron were used, resulting in failure. The second casting was successful, but there was a void inside, and it was only completed after rework. The waste was equivalent to over 2,000 catties of wheat. The fuse of the 200-horsepower motor at the Haizhou Flour Mill exploded once during start-up, affecting production. The mill's metal tiles smoked once due to negligent supervision (oil on the tiles burned, posing a risk of burning down the entire machine room). Due to lax inspections by the leadership, inferior flour was produced once in early August, affecting sales volume.

　　At the Longdong Match Factory (joint public-private), 113 bundles of matchsticks (100 catties per bundle) were mildewed due to careless storage in late August. The loss was equivalent to over 1,000 catties of wheat. The occurrence of the above accidents has caused huge losses to state property. All enterprise departments should conduct thorough inspections in the future and promptly formulate effective measures to eliminate accidents.

　　山东省新海电厂等不断发生责任事故
    黄河同志来信建议各工厂作深入检查并制定改进办法编者同志：
    山东新海连市部分公营企业工厂，八月份因对安全生产未加重视，不断发生责任事故，损失了大批国家资财。
    新海电厂，由于领导上及技工张多奇、张花松等有严重的官僚主义作风，于六月下旬修理五百基罗变压器时机器被烧坏，损失约合小麦三万余斤。此事发生后，该厂领导上没有追究责任，也没有很好的研究出消灭事故办法。本月十一日孙家山变电所又有一台五百基罗变压器给烧毁了，使连云港挖泥船停工两个月，厂中损失修理等费计四千五百二十四斤小麦。停电时间中各工厂的损失更是无法计算。
    华兴铁工厂在给东辛农场铸压垅滚子时，对花生铁的数目估计不足，第一次需六百斤重，但只花了四百斤铁，因而未铸成。第二次铸成后，内有一个窖笼，经反工后才铸成。浪费合小麦二千余斤。海州面粉厂二百马力马达的保险丝曾在开车时间爆炸一次，影响了生产。磨子五金瓦，因看管不严，冒烟一次（瓦上油类燃烧，有使全部机房被烧危险）。领导上因放松检查，在八月上旬曾一度磨出劣等面粉，影响销售量。
    陇东火柴厂（公私合营），八月下旬因保管不细心，霉烂火柴杆一百一十三包（每包一百斤）。其损失折合小麦千余斤。以上事故的发生，使国家资财受到巨大损失。各个企业部门今后应深入检查，并从速制定有效办法，以消灭事故。                                       
    黄河
