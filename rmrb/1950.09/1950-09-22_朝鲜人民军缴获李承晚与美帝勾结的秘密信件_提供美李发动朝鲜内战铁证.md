Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st: The Pyongyang newspapers "Nodong Sinmun" and "Democratic Korea" published a secret letter written in English by the Korean traitor Syngman Rhee to his "Special Envoy to the United States" Cho Pyong-ok on April 10, 1949. This letter provides ironclad evidence of the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang's conspiracy to launch the Korean civil war and exposes that the Syngman Rhee gang's so-called "Northern Expedition" plan was premeditated for a long time. Syngman Rhee wrote: "I think the question you raised in the telegram as to whether it is appropriate to publicly request military assistance is very timely. However, I am afraid that doing so will undermine Ambassador Muccio's top-secret plan, so I do not intend to proceed publicly. When Ambassador Muccio visited me with Counselor Tillem, I gently asked him: How is it going? He said: 'Military assistance has been approved, and the President (referring to Truman) has already signed the relevant documents.' ... He also said that direct requests for increased military assistance, if known to the general public, would ruin the plan. I think he is right. Many people are against giving weapons to Korea, just as they are against giving sharp knives to children."

"What you and I are about to do seems very despicable, but we must make the whole world believe that what we are doing is not despicable. ... Publicly requesting weapons and ammunition is a very risky behavior. That's why I gave you a secret mission."

"Furthermore, I should also tell you the reason why we do not need to take sneaky actions. ... We ask for weapons to protect ourselves and the security of the United States. If we are ignored again, not only Korea but also the United States will suffer disaster. ... I think you can secretly discuss this situation with senior officials of the United Nations and the United States and tell them our plan for the unification of North and South in a very secret way. In fact, except for the problem of lacking weapons and ammunition, we have made all the preparations for unification in other aspects. ... If the North is purged, everything will be satisfactory to us."

The letter went on to explain that after "attacking the North," the Syngman Rhee army also planned to make "combat preparations" on the Yalu and Tumen Rivers bordering China and the Soviet Union. For this purpose, Syngman Rhee said that the United States needed to supply two 8,000-ton warships equipped with 18-inch guns, fast patrol boats and aircraft, and also needed to equip an organized and trained army of 200,000.

Syngman Rhee wrote: "We can organize an army of 200,000 in a short period of time. We have hundreds of thousands of people who were forcibly conscripted into the Japanese army and went to the front lines. Many of them sacrificed on the islands of the South Pacific and the Manchurian front. But most of the generals were trained in Japanese universities, and they behaved very honestly for fear of being called pro-Japanese. People hardly know their details. ... As long as we have enough weapons to equip them, they can fight desperately."

Syngman Rhee finally said: "I think all of this can make you understand why I asked you to make long-term and secret requests. You must achieve results when talking with American and United Nations officials."

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 21st: Pyongyang newspapers have published a letter written by Cho Pyong-ok, former Syngman Rhee puppet government's special envoy to the United States, to Syngman Rhee on October 12, 1949. This letter fully exposes the fact that the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee gang conspired to launch a civil war.

The letter wrote: "I read with great interest President's letter to Dr. Oliver on the issue of unification and the situation of the North Korean regime. The plan proposed by Your Excellency in the letter is the only correct direction to achieve our long-cherished desire for unification under the current situation; it is a very appropriate way."

"But after considering the attitudes held by all the important people, I believe that now is not the time to implement the plan."

"First of all, I still have great doubts about our preparations; and international public opinion will not agree with us to take such action."

"The Greek government wanted to take military measures against Albania, but later accepted the advice of friendly countries and stopped. ..."

"Ambassador Chang Myon and I discussed this issue with Dr. Oliver and reached a consensus that when we are ready and at a certain time, we can implement the plan as the basic policy of our government."

"President, please forgive me for expressing this personal opinion in front of you. I am loyal to Your Excellency, so I told it straight."

　　朝鲜人民军缴获李承晚与美帝勾结的秘密信件
    提供美李发动朝鲜内战铁证
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】此间《劳动新闻》与《民主朝鲜》等报刊载了朝鲜人民军缴获的朝鲜卖国头子李承晚于一九四九年四月十日，用英文写给他的《驻美特使》赵炳玉的一封秘密信件。这封信提供了美国帝国主义和李承晚匪帮阴谋发动朝鲜内战的铁证，并且暴露了李承晚匪帮的所谓“北伐”计划是蓄意已久的。李承晚写道：“我认为你在电报中所提出的公开要求军事援助是否妥当的问题，是很合时机的。但是，我因害怕那样作会破坏缪锡俄大使的极秘密的计划，所以不拟公开进行。缪锡俄大使偕特勒姆来特参赞来访我的时候，我曾轻轻地问他：办得怎么样了？他说：“军事援助已获批准，总统（按指杜鲁门）在有关此事的文件上业已签署”。……他并说，关于增加军援的直接要求如被一般人知道，就会使计划破产。我认为他说得很对。有许多人反对给朝鲜以武器，正如反对给小孩子以利刃一样。”
    “你我所要作的事情好像是很卑劣的，但我们一定要使全世界相信我们所作的事情并不卑劣。……公开要求武器弹药是很冒险的行为。正因为如此，我才赋予你秘密的使命。”
    “再者，我也应该把我们不需要采取鬼头鬼脑的行为的理由告诉你。……我们要求武器，是为了保卫我们自己和美国的安全。假如再要不理我们的话，那末不但韩国，就连美国也要遭受灾难。……我认为你可以把这种情形秘密地向联合国和美国的高级官员提出加以讨论，并以极秘密的方式把我们南北统一的计划告诉他们。事实上我们除了缺乏武器弹药这一个问题以外，其他方面都已有了统一的准备。……假如肃清了北方，一切事情就会令我们满意。”
    该信继即说明李承晚军计划在“打到北方”以后，还要在与中苏两国交界的鸭绿江与图门江作“战斗准备”。为了这一目的，李承晚说需要美国供给装有十八英寸口径炮的八千吨级军舰两艘，需要快速巡逻艇与飞机，还需要装备有组织有训练的陆军二十万。
    李承晚写道：“我们能够在短时期内组织二十万陆军。我们有数十万曾被日本人强征入伍上过前线的人。其中有许多人在南太平洋的各岛屿和满洲战线牺牲了。但是大部分将校是在日本大学受过训练的，他们因为唯恐别人称他们为亲日派，所以表现得很老实。人们差不多都不知道他们的底细。……只要我们有充分的武器把他们装备起来，他们是可以拚命斗争的。”
    李承晚最后说：“我想这一切情况可以让你明白我为什么叫你进行长期而秘密的要求。你在和美国及联合国官员谈话时一定要获得成果”。
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】平壤各报顷刊载人民军所缴获的前李承晚傀儡政府驻美特使赵炳玉于一九四九年十月十二日写给李承晚的信。这封信充分暴露了美国帝国主义与李承晚匪帮阴谋发动内战的事实。
    信内写道：“我以极大的兴趣恭读了总统阁下就统一问题和北韩政权处境问题，写给奥里勃博士的信。阁下在该函中所提出的方案，在目前形势下，是达成我们统一宿望的唯一正确方针；是很适当的办法。
    但是我考虑了一切要人所持的态度后，认为现在还不是实现该计划的时期。
    首先，我对我们的准备还抱着很大的怀疑；并且国际舆论也不会赞同我们采取那种行动。
    希腊政府曾想对阿尔巴尼亚采取军事措施，后来接受友邦各国的劝告而停止了。……
    我和张勉大使曾就这一问题与奥里勃博士讨论过，并获得一致的意见，认为等到我们有了准备，到了一定时期，就可以把该计划当作我们政府的基本政策来实行。
    总统阁下，请原谅我在你面前提出的这种个人见解，我是为阁下尽忠的，所以直截了当地提了出来。”
