　　【Shenyang News】According to the Northeast Daily, some units under the Northeast Industrial Department have not been thorough enough in their work inspections during the rectification campaign. Some leading cadres lack self-criticism, which urgently needs to be corrected.

　　Although most bureaus and companies have put forward key points for work inspection and formulated rectification progress plans, according to the August situation inspection, some units have failed to achieve this according to the plan. Some issues that should have been concluded were not completed by the deadline, and some had not even completed the inspection of one issue. Others failed to grasp the key points and were all-encompassing but extremely superficial. For example, the Mechanical Bureau mentioned production plans, quality, unity with technical personnel, business management, and leadership inspection in its summary, but each issue lacked depth. It failed to identify the root cause of the problems or propose specific measures to improve the work. The formation of this phenomenon is mainly due to the fact that the leaders of some bureaus and companies emphasized that the rectification campaign conflicted with the time for formulating the 1951 production plan, and they were too busy to cope, thus relaxing the leadership of work inspection in the rectification campaign. In the work inspection, many units did not pay attention to the study of specific materials and figures, but only put forward problems in terms of regulations and empty words, lacking specific materials and correct figures that could illustrate the problems. This made it impossible to further discover problems and propose improvement measures adapted to the specific situation.

　　Another serious problem worthy of attention is the lack of strict self-criticism spirit among some leading cadres. In the summary of the inspection of leadership style, in addition to blaming subordinates and listing many problems that occurred with subordinates, when it came to leadership problems, they only generally stated: "This is because there was only a plan, but no inspection, specific assistance, and timely summary of experience." "Because the understanding of the situation below was not specific, there was no focus." or "Leadership was trapped in routine affairs" and "Insufficient attention was paid to this issue." As for what responsibilities the leadership should bear? What are the basic problems of the leadership style, especially on important issues? They were not specific or profound enough. For example, the Mechanical Bureau's singular production viewpoint is one of the bureau's important problems. In the inspection, it was only mentioned that this kind of thinking was wrong in the past, but the kind of losses it brought to the work under the guidance of this production viewpoint was not deeply inspected and given a powerful criticism. Situations similar to the above will seriously hinder the thorough inspection of leadership ideology and style in the inspection work, which will also be an obstacle to improving future work.

　　In order to promote the rectification campaign further, the Industrial Department issued a notice to all bureaus and companies on September 5, urging them to pay attention to correction.

### 东北工业部部分单位整风发生偏向  领导干部缺乏自我批评  工作检查没有抓住关键

　　东北工业部部分单位整风发生偏向
    领导干部缺乏自我批评  工作检查没有抓住关键
    【沈阳讯】据东北日报消息：东北工业部所属部分单位，整风中检查工作不深刻，某些领导干部缺乏自我批评，急待纠正。
    各局、公司在整风中虽大都提出了检查工作的重点，制订了整风进度计划，但据八月份情况检查，部分单位并未能按计划实现。有的是应该结束的问题到期没有结束，甚至连一个问题还没检查完；有的是没有抓住重点，面面俱到，极不深刻。如机械局在总结中，提到了生产计划、质量、团结技术人员，经营管理及领导检查等方面，但每个问题都不深刻，既未找出问题的症结所在，亦未提出改进工作的具体办法。这种现象的形成，主要是由于某些局、公司的领导强调整风与制订一九五一年生产计划的时间有冲突，忙不过来，放松了在整风中检查工作的领导。在检查工作中，不少单位不重视对具体材料和数字的研究，只是条文的、空洞的提出问题，缺乏能够说明问题的具体材料和正确数字，这就不能深入一步发现问题和提出适应具体情况的改进办法。
    再一个值得注意的严重问题，是某些领导干部缺少严格的自我批评精神。在检查领导作风的总结中，除责备下级与列举下级所发生的许多问题外，涉及到领导问题时，只是一般的提出：“是由于只有计划，没有检查、具体帮助、及时的总结经验。”“由于对下面情况了解不具体，没有重点。”或“领导陷于事务”和“对这一问题也不够重视。”至于领导上究竟要负什么责任？领导作风特别在重要问题上的基本毛病究竟在那里？却提的不够具体也不深刻。如机械局单一化的生产观点是该局的重要问题之一，在检查中只提到过去有这种思想不对，但在这种生产观点的指导下，给工作带来怎样的损失未能进行深刻检查，给予有力的批判。类似上述情况，将严重的阻碍着在检查工作中对领导思想作风的彻底检查，这对于改进今后工作，也将是一种阻力。
    为使整风推进一步，工业部已于九月五日通报各局、公司注意纠正。
