　　Marching Towards Socialism with Full Confidence
    A Record of the Exhibition of the People's Republic of Romania
    Chen Youwei

　　The "Exhibition of the People's Republic of Romania Marching Towards Socialism," which opened on September 11th at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace, is the most grand and comprehensive exhibition organized by our Central People's Government's Ministry of Culture. It will play a very important role in promoting friendship and cultural exchange between the Chinese and Romanian people.

　　Thanks to more than two months of preparation and the meticulous design and arrangement by three Romanian experts, the interior of the main hall of the Cultural Palace, which serves as the exhibition venue, has been completely transformed. Visitors entering the venue will no longer see an ancient palace with carved beams and painted rafters, but a spacious, bright, and harmoniously colored, completely modern exhibition hall.

　　Upon entering, we can see the portrait of Chairman Mao, carefully painted by Romanian artist Adina, hanging high on the wall. In several photos of mass rallies and parades, we can see the portraits of Chairman Mao and Stalin, and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej being held high by the people. The Romanian people love the leaders of the world's working people and the leaders of the Chinese people as much as they love their own leaders.

　　The content of the exhibition begins with pictures of Romanian history. Like other Eastern European people's democratic countries, old Romania was a poor and backward country ruled by imperialists and the landlord-bourgeois regime. In one picture, we can see: a terrifying and ugly green octopus, stretching its demonic hands—tentacles, controlling Romania's oil, electricity, mines, and all its rich resources. This is a portrayal of the rule of the reactionary Hohenzollern dynasty of old Romania. Next to the octopus is a tragic scene: a middle-aged woman in tattered clothes sitting in a pile of rubble, looking completely despairing at the dying child in her arms. Under the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Hohenzollern dynasty, the working people of Romania, like this woman, fell into the disasters of hunger, poverty, and death. But the flames of the laboring people's struggle for improved living conditions immediately burned up. Influenced by the Russian bourgeois democratic revolution of 1905, Romanian peasants rose up in 1907, which was the largest peasant uprising in Romanian history. However, this uprising was violently suppressed by the reactionary ruling class. It was not until the founding of the Romanian Communist Party in 1921, influenced and inspired by the great Russian October Revolution, that the struggle of the working people had correct leadership and direction. Under the leadership of the RCP and its leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, in February 1933, the national railway and oil factory workers held a general strike. This large-scale strike shook the ruling foundation of the bourgeois regime. During the terrible and dark years of occupation by the German invaders from 1941 to 1944, the RCP always led the Romanian people in carrying out an unwavering national liberation struggle.

　　On August 23, 1945, the great Soviet army liberated Romania from the long-term rule of the landlord-bourgeois regime and the enslavement of the German invaders, opening up the path to freedom, brightness, happiness, and socialism for the Romanian people. At the entrance of the venue, we can see the portrait of Stalin, the leader of the working people of the world. Below it to the left stands a large relief created by a Romanian sculptor: Romanian workers, women, and children are sending bouquets of flowers in one direction—to their great liberator—Stalin. At the same time, from other pictures and a large wall tapestry with embroidered pictures, we can also see the Romanian people's sincere respect and love for the Soviet army.

　　After liberation, Romania, under the leadership of the Workers' Party (formed in 1948 by the merger of the RCP and the left wing of the Romanian Social Democratic Party), implemented a series of democratic reforms: the land reform of 1945; the currency reform of 1947; and the nationalization of major industries and banks in June 1948. This enabled the national economy, which had been severely damaged by the war, to recover and develop, thus creating conditions for the implementation of the 1949 economic plan. The figures in various production charts in the exhibition show that Romania's industrial and agricultural production has made great progress. The output of steel in 1949 increased by 34% compared with 1948, and cast iron increased by 43%. After the completion of the 1950 national economic plan, the industrial production level will increase by 37% compared with last year, the output of steel will reach 1.25 million tons, an increase of 59% compared with 1948, the number of machine and tractor stations will increase from 70 in 1948 to 138, and the number of cooperatives will increase from 2,624 in 1945 to 5,497.

　　The great progress in economic construction has made it possible to improve the living standards of the working people. The living standards in 1950 have increased by 200% compared with 1944. In contrast to the picture of the tragic life of the people under the Hohenzollern dynasty, is a photograph of a mother and daughter full of confidence in victory and happiness, looking into the distance. As their country marches towards socialism, they have seen an even better future.

　　The supply of food and clothing has been generally improved and increased, the right to rest can also be widely enjoyed, and schools have opened the door to knowledge for the broad masses of working people. Vocational schools and evening schools are increasing day by day. The cultural level of the workers has also been improved. After a day of hard work, they can go to the opera house to receive the edification of music and drama. The dramas written by Romanian writers with the life of workers as their theme are loved and appreciated by the broad masses of Romanian working people.

　　In a corner of the exhibition, various Romanian publications are also displayed, including the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, which are loved and must-read by the broad masses of Romanian people, the works of Russian writers and famous Soviet writers, the works of Chairman Mao and Comrade Liu Shaoqi, and the Romanian translation of Lu Xun's novels.

　　The road of development in Romania for the past six years is a victorious road shining with the brilliance of the people's democratic system. Relying on the friendly assistance of the great Soviet Union, the achievements made by the Romanian people's democratic regime in the past six years are more than what was done in a hundred years under the reactionary regime. Today, the people of Romania are marching towards the road of socialism with full confidence. The experience of building socialism that they have learned from the Soviet Union in the past six years can serve as a reference for the Chinese people who are today immersed in economic construction. The road they have taken in the past six years is also the road we are going to take today. We believe that through this rich and vivid exhibition, we will not only increase our understanding of the People's Romania, but also strengthen our confidence in fighting for peace and creating a better future.

　　满怀信心地走向社会主义
    记罗马尼亚人民共和国展览会
    陈有为
    九月十一日在北京劳动人民文化宫揭幕的“向社会主义迈进的罗马尼亚人民共和国的展览会”，是我中央人民政府文化部所主办的、规模最宏大内容最丰富的展览会。它对于中罗人民友谊的增进、中罗文化的交流，将起十分重要的作用。
    由于经过两个多月的筹备与三位罗马尼亚专家精心设计布置的结果，已使作为展览会会场的文化宫正殿内部完全改观，参观者在进入会场后所见到的已不是古色古香的有着雕梁画栋的宫殿，而是一所宽敞明朗、色泽调和的完全现代化的展览室。
    进门后我们就可以看到高悬在墙上的由罗马尼亚画家阿迪那所精心绘制的毛主席的画像。在好几幅群众集会游行的照片中，我们都可以看到毛主席和斯大林、乔治乌·德治的画像被人们高举着，罗马尼亚的人民正像爱戴他们自己的领袖一样地爱戴着世界劳动人民的领袖与中国人民的领袖。
    展览会内容从罗马尼亚历史的图片开始。正如其他的东欧人民民主国家一样，旧罗马尼亚也是一个在帝国主义者与地主资产阶级政权统治下的贫困落后的国家。在一幅图片中，我们可以看到：一头可怕的丑恶的绿色大鱆鱼，伸张着它的魔手——触须，控制了整个罗马尼亚的石油、电业、矿井与一切丰富的资源。这就是旧罗马尼亚反动的何汉卓伦皇朝统治的写照。在鱆鱼的旁边，是一幅悲惨的图景：一个坐在瓦砾堆里的衣衫褴褛的中年妇人，完全绝望地看着在她怀抱中的奄奄一息的孩子，在何汉卓伦皇朝的残酷压榨与剥削下，罗马尼亚的劳动人民都像这个妇人一样，陷入了饥饿贫困与死亡的灾难之中。但劳动人民为要求改善生活条件而斗争的火焰立刻燃烧起来，受着一九○五年俄国资产阶级民主革命的影响，罗马尼亚农民在一九○七年揭竿而起，这就是罗马尼亚历史上最大的农民起义。但这次起义结果被反动的统治阶级以暴力镇压下去了。直到罗马尼亚共产党，因受伟大的俄国十月革命影响与感召于一九二一年成立以后，劳动人民的斗争才有了正确的领导与方向。在罗共及其领袖乔治乌·德治的领导之下，一九三三年二月全国铁路与油厂工人举行总罢工，这次大规模的罢工摇撼了资产阶级政权的统治基础。在一九四一——一九四四年德国侵略者所占领的恐怖与黑暗的年月里，罗共始终领导罗马尼亚人民进行着坚持不渝的民族解放斗争。
    一九四五年八月二十三日，伟大的苏联军队，把罗马尼亚从长期的地主资产阶级的统治政权与德国侵略者的奴役下解放出来，为罗马尼亚人民打开了自由、光明、幸福与走向社会主义的道路。在会场的进口处，我们可以迎面看到全世界劳动人民的领袖斯大林的画像，在它的左下方，竖立着一座罗马尼亚雕刻家所创作的大浮雕：罗马尼亚的工人、妇女和儿童们，把一束束的鲜花送往一个方向——送给他们的伟大的解放者——斯大林。同时，从另几幅图片与一幅绣着图画的大墙毯中，我们还可以看到罗马尼亚人民对于苏军所表示的真诚的崇敬与热爱。
    获得解放后的罗马尼亚，在工人党（一九四八年由罗共与罗马尼亚社会民主党左翼联合组成）领导下的人民民主政权实行了一系列的民主改革：一九四五年的土地改革；一九四七年的币制改革；一九四八年六月主要工业与银行等的国有化。这就使被战争所严重破坏的国民经济得以恢复与发展，因而创造了实行一九四九年经济计划的条件。展览会中各种生产图表的数字显示，罗马尼亚的工业生产与农业生产已有巨大的进展，一九四九年钢的产量已较一九四八年增加百分之三十四，铸铁则增加百分之四十三。一九五○年国民经济计划完成以后，工业生产水平将较去年增加百分之三十七，钢的产量将达一百二十五万吨，而较一九四八年增加百分之五十九，机器与拖拉机站将由一九四八年的七十个增加至一百三十八个，合作社将由一九四五年的二千六百二十四个增加至五千四百九十七个。
    经济建设的巨大进展，使得劳动人民生活水平的提高成为可能。一九五○年的生活水平已较一九四四年提高了百分之二百。与在何汉卓伦皇朝统治下的人民的悲惨生活图画相对照的，是一幅充满着胜利和幸福的信心，眼望着远方的母与女的照片，在她们的国家向着社会主义迈进的时候，她们已看到了更为美好的未来。
    食物与衣着的供应已有普遍的改善与增加，休息权亦可广泛地享受，学校已为广大的劳动人民打开了求智的大门，专业学校与业余学校正在日益增加。工人的文化生活水平亦已提高，当他们经过一天辛勤的劳动后，可以前往歌剧院中去领受音乐、戏剧的陶冶。罗马尼亚作家所写的、以工人生活为主题的戏剧都为广大的罗马尼亚劳动人民所喜爱欣赏。
    在展览会的一角，还陈列着各种罗马尼亚文的出版物，其中包括为广大的罗马尼亚人民所爱好与必读的马恩列斯的著作，俄国文学家与苏联名作家的作品，毛主席、刘少奇同志的著作与鲁迅的小说也有罗马尼亚文的译本。
    罗马尼亚六年来发展的道路，是一条闪耀着人民民主制度光辉的胜利的道路，依靠着伟大苏联的友谊的帮助，罗马尼亚人民民主政权在过去六年内所获得的成就，已较在反动政权统治之下一百年所做的还要多。今天罗马尼亚的人民正满怀信心地向社会主义的道路迈进，他们在六年中从苏联学习来的建设社会主义的经验，可以作为今天正在埋头进行经济建设的中国人民的借镜。他们六年来所走的道路，也正是我们今天所要走的道路。我们相信，通过这次内容丰富而生动的展览会，我们不但会增进对于人民罗马尼亚的认识，而且将加强我们为争取和平、创造美好的将来而斗争的信心。（附图片）
