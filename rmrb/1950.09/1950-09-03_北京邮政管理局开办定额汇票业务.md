　　Beijing Postal Administration Opens Fixed-Amount Postal Money Order Service
    To meet the needs of the people, the Beijing Postal Administration began handling fixed-amount postal money order services on September 1st. All levels of post offices in Beijing and designated agencies are handling the service. This fixed-amount postal money order is available in six denominations: 5,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 20,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, 100,000 yuan, and 200,000 yuan. The remittance and withdrawal procedures are more convenient than usual. When purchasing a money order, it is not necessary to fill out an application form. When purchasing this money order from an agency, it is not necessary to specify the paying post office. As long as there is a post office or agency with remittance services, the money can be withdrawn. (Chen Buxiang)
