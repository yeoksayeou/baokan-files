　　The Victory of the People of the World!
    ——Congratulating the Public Release of "The Victory of the Chinese People"

    The completion of the color film "The Victory of the Chinese People," from the perspective of culture and art, concretely demonstrates the friendly mutual assistance between China and the Soviet Union. It also illustrates that our—the Chinese people's—culture and art, in certain aspects, just like our other production and construction endeavors, must learn from the Soviet elder brother and must have the help of the Soviet elder brother in order to be completed happily and quickly.
    Now, with joy and gratitude, we congratulate the completion and public release of this film. The public release of this film coincides with the first anniversary of the founding of our People's Republic of China, the National Day celebration. On such a joyous day, it is of great significance to review our past through this film, or rather, to see our "The Victory of the Chinese People."
    As everyone knows, "The Victory of the Chinese People" is a victory not only for the Chinese people. Without exaggeration, it is another great victory for the people of the world after the October Revolution. This victory provides a good example for the liberation struggles of semi-colonial and colonial countries, and it also strengthens the confidence of the people of semi-colonial and colonial countries in carrying out liberation struggles against imperialism and traitors. It is this truth that victory always belongs to the people: we are like this, and other peoples invaded by imperialism, such as the Korean and Vietnamese people, will also be like this.
    At the same time, this victory—the victory of 475 million people—further strengthens the peace camp. Because, as Chairman Mao declared in his opening speech at the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference: "The Chinese, who account for a quarter of humanity, have stood up." The meaning of "standing up" is victory, is becoming the masters of the country, and in terms of the future of all mankind, we have become one of the most important protagonists. Our leaning towards the peace camp led by the Soviet Union forces the warmongers to have some concerns when they want to launch a world war. This is another significant meaning of "The Victory of the Chinese People."
    Therefore, "The Victory of the Chinese People" is the pride and joy of our Chinese people, and of course, we should be proud and joyful. Only those people who have gone through this can understand our feelings. This victory did not fall from the sky. Under the leadership of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought, we tenaciously overcame many difficulties and finally drove the U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek out of the Chinese mainland, and the new China was victoriously established. "The Victory of the Chinese People," this color film jointly produced by Chinese and Soviet filmmakers, records this. It also shows how our victory is closely related to the Soviet Union and even the working people of the world.
    We are like this, but the enemy is certainly different. The enemy is afraid of our victory, hates our victory, and tries every means to undermine our victory. U.S. imperialism openly invades our Taiwan, attempting to prevent our army from completing the liberation of Taiwan across the sea. This is the best illustration. Therefore, to consolidate the victory of our Chinese people and ensure that we move towards our bright future, we must liberate our Taiwan. No matter what U.S. imperialism or the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang does, we will, as we have in the past, victoriously come through and victoriously move towards the future. "The Victory of the Chinese People" is the fact, and the Chinese people will use the fact of victory to answer the U.S. imperialist aggressors and their running dogs. After watching "The Victory of the Chinese People," we are filled with such confidence to welcome the victory of liberating Taiwan.

　　全世界人民的胜利！
    ——贺《中国人民的胜利》公映

    彩色片《中国人民的胜利》的摄成，从文化艺术这一部门来说，是具体地表现了中苏的友好互助。也说明我们——中国人民的文化艺术，在某些方面正如我们其他生产建设一样，必须向苏联老大哥学习，必须有苏联老大哥的帮助，才能愉快地迅速地完成。
    现在，我们以欢欣和感谢的心情，来祝贺这部片子的摄成和公映。公映这部片子的时候，是我们中华人民共和国开国纪念第一周年的国庆日。在这样一个大喜庆的日子，从这部影片来检阅我们的过去，或者说来看我们的《中国人民的胜利》，这是有其重大意义的。
    众所周知，《中国人民的胜利》，这胜利不止于中国人民。毫不夸大的说，这是全世界人民继十月革命后又一伟大胜利。这胜利提供了半殖民地、殖民地的解放斗争的好范例，也加强了半殖民地、殖民地国家的人民对帝国主义和卖国贼作解放斗争的信心。就是这个真理，胜利是永远属于人民：我们是这样，其他被帝国主义侵略的朝鲜、越南人民等等也将会是这样。
    同时，这胜利——四亿七千五百万人的胜利更壮大了和平阵营。因为我们如毛主席在中国人民政治协商会议第一届全体会议上的开幕词中所宣示：“占人类总数四分之一的中国人从此站立起来了。”“站立起来”的意义，就是胜利，就是作了国家的主人，而且在全人类的前途来说，我们成了举足轻重的主角之一。我们倒向以苏联为首的和平阵营这一边，战争贩子想发动世界大战就不得不有所顾虑。这是《中国人民的胜利》的又一重大意义。
    因此，《中国人民的胜利》，是我们中国人民的骄傲和喜悦，当然，我们是应该骄傲和喜悦的。了解我们这种感情的，只有那些曾经这样走过来的人民。这胜利不是从天而降，是在马列主义——毛泽东思想领导下，顽强地克服了许多困难，最后从中国大陆上赶走了美帝及其走狗蒋介石，新中国才胜利地建立了起来。《中国人民的胜利》，这中苏两国的电影工作者联合摄制的彩色片，就纪录了这个。也说明了我们的胜利，是如何与苏联以至全世界的劳动人民休戚相关。
    我们是这样，敌人当然是另一样。敌人是害怕我们的胜利的，是讨厌我们的胜利的，而且还千方百计来破坏我们的胜利。美帝国主义公然侵略我们的台湾，妄图阻止我们大军的渡海完成台湾的解放，这就是最好的说明。因此，要巩固我们中国人民的胜利，保障走入我们美好的将来，我们一定要解放我们的台湾。不管美帝或者是蒋介石匪帮怎样，我们会如我们过去一样，胜利地走了过来，也会胜利地走向将来。《中国人民的胜利》就是事实，中国人民会用胜利这事实来答复美帝侵略者及其走狗们。看了《中国人民的胜利》，就充满了这样信心，来迎接解放台湾的胜利。
