　　Conspiracy to Sabotage Asian Labor Movement and National Liberation Movement
　　Reactionary International Confederation of Free Trade Unions Establishes Espionage Organization in Asia
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 17th] TASS reported, citing the Electrical Communication Agency: The so-called "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," established and funded by the U.S. State Department, announced on the 15th the establishment of an "Intelligence Advisory Bureau" in Singapore, which is an espionage agency. It will also establish branches in Japan and the Philippines to train special agents in these regions, conduct activities to sabotage the Asian workers' movement and the national liberation movements in Southeast Asia.
　　Note: The reactionary International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sent a delegation to the Far East for two months, starting on July 1st. They visited Tokyo, Taiwan, and Manila. The imperialist bloc, alarmed by the increasing development of national liberation movements in Malaya, the Philippines, and elsewhere, and by the increasing opposition of Japanese trade unions to all attempts to revive Japanese militarism, is attempting to use reactionary trade unions to undermine the unity of workers' movements in Asian countries. Now, these splitters have openly acted as spies for imperialism, thus exposing their base features of opposing the interests of the working class.

　　阴谋破坏亚洲工运及民族解放运动
    反动国际工会联合会在亚洲设立间谍组织
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社布拉格十七日电引电通社消息：由美国国务院设立和资助的所谓“国际自由工会联合会”，于十五日宣布在新加坡成立谍报机关性质的“情报咨询局”，并将在日本及菲律宾等地设立分局，以便在各该地区训练特务，进行破坏亚洲的工人运动及东南亚各民族的解放运动的活动。
    按：反动的国际自由工会联合会，曾于七月一日派遣代表团来远东活动两个月，曾先后到过东京、台湾及马尼拉等地。帝国主义集团慑于马来亚、菲律宾等地民族解放运动的日益开展，和日本的工会越来越多地反对复兴日本军国主义的一切图谋，妄图利用反动工会来破坏亚洲各国的工人运动的团结。现在这些分裂分子公开充任了帝国主义的间谍脚色，从而暴露了他们反对工人阶级利益的卑劣面目。
