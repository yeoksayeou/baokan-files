Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 30th: State-owned coal mines in Northeast China are actively carrying out a comprehensive reform of coal mining methods. To date, the number of sites that have initially implemented or are ready to implement new coal mining methods accounts for more than half of all coal mining sites still in production in Northeast China. Among them, thirteen sites have fully mechanized the coal mining process, from the basic coal mining process to underground transportation. By the end of this year, it is estimated that 70 percent of coal mining sites will implement new coal mining methods, and the basic coal mining process at forty sites will be fully mechanized.

The new coal mining method adopts the "longwall" system, which has a long working face, high recovery rate, standardized operation, and can fully utilize mechanical efficiency. It can not only ensure production safety and increase output but also reduce costs. This new method is exactly what Northeast China's coal mines urgently need because in a few years, the demand for coal in Northeast China will exceed more than double the production capacity of Northeast China's coal mines last year. At the same time, in a few years, many mine entrances in Northeast China will become obsolete due to the exhaustion of coal reserves, and the number of coal-producing entrances will decrease. If the coal mining method is not changed, the needs at that time cannot be met. To this end, the Northeast Coal Mining Administration has decided that each mining bureau must regard the implementation of new coal mining methods as a major task for 1950 and make every effort to complete it.

Currently, sites that have generally implemented the new coal mining methods have saved more than half of their labor force compared to before. The production efficiency of direct coal miners has increased by one to three times. The recovery rate of thick coal seams has increased from 30 percent to 60 or 65 percent, with the highest reaching about 80 percent; the recovery rate of thin coal seams has also increased from 60 to 70 percent to more than 90 percent. After the new coal mining methods are implemented throughout Northeast China, it will extract tens of billions of tons of coal from the ground for the country.

### 东北国营煤矿  半数场子用新法采煤

　　东北国营煤矿
    半数场子用新法采煤
    【新华社沈阳八月三十日电】东北国营煤矿正积极进行采煤方法的全面改革。迄今初步实行或准备就绪即将实行新法采煤的场子，约占东北全部尚在生产中的采煤场子的半数以上，其中十三个场子由煤矿生产基本过程的采煤工作至坑下部分运输工作，已全部机械化。至今年年底，预计将有百分之七十的采煤场子实行新法采煤，四十个场子的采煤基本过程全部使用机械。
    新采煤方法是采用“长壁式”，其工作面长，回收率高，作业正规，机械效能可以充分发挥，不仅能保证生产安全，提高产量，又能降低成本。这种新法正是东北煤矿所极须采用的，因为数年后东北需煤量将超过去年东北煤矿生产力的一倍以上，同时，数年后东北煤矿中将因不少坑口煤量采完而作废，产煤坑口因之减少，如不改变采煤方法，即不能满足届时的需要。为此，东北煤矿管理局决定，各矿务局必须把实行新采煤方法当作一九五零年的重大任务，尽全力加以完成。
    目前一般已实行新法采煤的场子，劳动力较前节省一倍以上。直接采煤工人的生产效率提高到一倍至三倍，厚煤层的回采率自百分之三十提高到百分之六十或六十五，最高提高到百分之八十左右；薄煤层的回采率，也自百分之六七十，提高到百分之九十以上。全东北实行新法采煤之后，将为国家多从地下开采出数十亿吨煤。
