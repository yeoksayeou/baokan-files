Xinhua News Agency, London, 21st dispatch by TASS: British Labour MP Harold Davies, during a debate in the House of Commons on the government's war preparedness policy on the 13th, condemned the British government's act of sending troops to participate in the war of aggression against Korea. Davies stated that Prime Minister Attlee attempted to justify the expenditure of £3.6 billion in military spending and the extension of conscription to two years in Parliament by claiming that North Korea had committed an act of aggression within its own borders. Davies said that spending such a large sum on expanding armaments was "criminal and nonsensical." He criticized Attlee for allowing Britain to be drawn into this large-scale, arrogant adventure without investigating the situation in Korea. He pointed out that the entire Far Eastern news propaganda machine was controlled by the extremely eccentric MacArthur, while British newspapers were content to publish second- or third-hand news that had been vetted by MacArthur. He said, "British newspapers have never advocated totalitarianism so obsequiously as they have in these days, and have never shown such a complete lack of objectivity and responsibility."

Davies stated that "the United Nations Security Council is now merely the tail of the White House." All the evidence and reliable witnesses from the Korean incident powerfully prove that it was not North Korea that launched the aggression, but the South Korean regime.

Davies said that increasing military pay cannot compensate parents for the loss of their sons or wives for the loss of their husbands, especially in this most despicable military adventure in the history of war. Parents would consider increasing military pay as the most despicable bribe.

　　英工党议员戴维斯
    斥英政府参加侵朝战争
    揭露艾德礼推行战争计划的罪恶
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社伦敦讯：英国工党议员哈罗德·戴维斯十三日在下院辩论政府备战政策时斥责英国派军队参加侵朝战争的行为。戴维斯称：艾德礼首相企图在议会中以所谓北朝鲜在自己国内犯了侵略行为为理由，来为支出军费三十六亿英镑和延长兵役到两年的措施辩护。戴维斯说，花费这样一大笔款项来扩充军备是“罪恶的和胡闹的”。他斥责艾德礼未经调查朝鲜局势即听任英国被卷入这个大规模的狂妄的冒险。他指出：整个远东新闻宣传机器为极其乖张的麦克阿瑟所操纵，而英国报纸则以登载这种经麦克阿瑟检查过的第二三手的新闻为满足。他说：“英国报纸从来没有像在这些日子里这样奴颜婢膝地主张极权，从来没有表现出这样完全缺乏客观性和责任心”。
    戴维斯称，“联合国安全理事会现在只不过是白宫的尾巴”。朝鲜事件的一切证据和可靠的证人都有力地证明：发动侵略的不是北朝鲜，而是南朝鲜政权。
    戴维斯说：增加军饷补偿不了父母之失去儿子和妻子之失去丈夫。特别是在这一战争史中最可鄙的军事冒险行动中。增加军饷会被做父母的认为是最卑鄙的贿赂。
