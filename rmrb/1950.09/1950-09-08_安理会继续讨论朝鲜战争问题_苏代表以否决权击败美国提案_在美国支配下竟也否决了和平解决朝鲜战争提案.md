Xinhua News Agency, 7th: TASS, New York, 7th – The United Nations Security Council met on September 6th to continue discussing the Korean War issue.

After adopting the agenda (the same as the agenda for the September 5th meeting), Soviet Representative Malik requested Security Council President Jebb to ask the Assistant Secretary-General to read out the letter from the Soviet government to the President of the Security Council, which included a copy of the Soviet government's note to the United States regarding the unprovoked attack by eleven U.S. fighter planes on unarmed Soviet training aircraft.

After the letter was read out, Jebb suggested that the Security Council should consider the Soviet letter when discussing the Korean War, just as it had previously agreed to consider the U.S. letter regarding the shooting down of Soviet aircraft.

Malik raised a point of order, pointing out that the Soviet government had notified the Security Council members of the original text of the Soviet note to the U.S. government, which was unrelated to the U.S. letter previously sent to the Security Council, and did not state that the Security Council should discuss this note.

Malik reiterated: The Soviet government's note was addressed to the U.S. government, so it is a matter between the two governments and not for the Security Council to discuss. However, U.S. Representative Austin asserted that the Soviet representative's letter was addressed to the Security Council and should therefore be decided by the Security Council.

Austin attempted to shift the responsibility for attacking Soviet aircraft onto the United Nations, insisting that all actions taken by the U.S. government in Korea since 1947 were actions of the United Nations. He said: The Soviet letter is before the Security Council, and the United States will request a discussion in the Security Council at the appropriate time.

Malik pointed out: There is nothing new in the U.S. representative's argument, he has been trying to use the United Nations label to cover up all U.S. actions in Korea since 1947. Malik said: Since the United States is now barbarously bombing Korean cities, villages, and peaceful residents, thereby killing Korean people, it is not surprising that the U.S. representative is trying to use the shield and banner of the United Nations to conceal all U.S. actions in Korea. But the Soviet government believes that the U.S. government should bear full responsibility for the actions of the U.S. military authorities, who have disgraced themselves by blatantly violating international law. The Soviet government insists on punishing the perpetrators of this crime and compensating for the loss of one aircraft and the deaths of three crew members. He concluded: These are actions taken by the U.S. military authorities for which the U.S. government should bear full responsibility, and these actions have nothing to do with the United Nations.

After Malik's speech, Jebb said: When the United States submitted the note regarding the aircraft incident, he had suggested considering it during the discussion of the "Complaint of Aggression Against the Republic of Korea." Therefore, he ruled that both the Soviet note and the U.S. note should be considered.

Malik replied: Jebb's statement is incorrect because, firstly, the Soviet delegation never said it favored discussing the U.S. note. Secondly, this issue has nothing to do with the agenda item cited by Jebb. Thirdly, if a member of the Security Council wants to discuss something, that is their right, but that does not mean his statement is an issue to be considered.

Jebb then asked Cuban Representative Alvarez to discuss the various proposals related to the Korean War. Alvarez declared that he would vote in favor of the U.S. proposal.

Kuomintang Representative Jiang Tingfu, in a lengthy anti-Soviet speech, said he would support the U.S. proposal, even though it was "not sufficient."

Egyptian Representative Fawzi and Ecuadorian Representative Quevedo also agreed with the U.S. proposal. Quevedo said that the Korean People's Republic's protest against the bombing and killing of peaceful residents should not be addressed until the Security Council receives the opinion of the "United Nations Command" on the matter.

Syngman Rhee's group's representative, Chang Myon, then expressed the hope that the member states of the Security Council would vote in favor of the U.S. proposal and reject the Soviet proposal.

Malik immediately requested clarification that although Chang Myon was illegally attending the Security Council discussion, his status was limited to making submissions to the Security Council and did not include expressing opinions on the proposal. Malik declared that no one was interested in Chang Myon's opinion.

Jebb, in his reply, insisted that this was not the case and announced that the United Kingdom would vote in favor of the U.S. proposal and against the Soviet proposal. Jebb then proposed a vote on the U.S. proposal.

Malik pointed out that at the meeting on September 5th, it was agreed that voting would be held after the debate, in the order in which the proposals were presented. He said that he would therefore agree to vote on the U.S. proposal and the first Soviet proposal. However, he decided to make a statement on the second Soviet proposal regarding the bombing of peaceful residents, in order to explain the reasons why the Soviet representative had put forward this proposal. He expressed his willingness to make this statement either before any voting took place or after the U.S. proposal and the first Soviet proposal were put to a vote.

Jebb said that the Soviet representative "may be right," and he suggested that the Security Council vote on the U.S. proposal and then "consider whether it could" adjourn.

Malik said that if a vote was held, both the U.S. proposal and the first Soviet proposal should be put to a vote.

The Security Council then voted on the U.S. proposal, under the pretext of "localization," to expand and deepen the Korean War, the so-called "Complaint of Aggression Against the Republic of Korea." The Soviet Union voted against this proposal, thus defeating it under the principle of unanimity among the great powers. Those voting in favor of the proposal included the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Norway, the Kuomintang, Ecuador, Cuba, Egypt, and India. Yugoslavia abstained.

Before the U.S. proposal was put to a vote, Malik requested the opportunity to briefly respond to two points made by Ecuadorian Representative Quevedo. Malik said that these statements were close to slandering the Soviet Union and the Soviet people. After quoting Quevedo's remarks about the so-called Soviet intolerance of other countries' philosophies and contempt for small countries, Malik pointed out that he did not believe the Ecuadorian representative intended to slander, but rather lacked understanding. He said: This is partly because Ecuador is too far from the Soviet Union, and partly because Ecuador and the Ecuadorian people must live and work under the constant hostile anti-Soviet propaganda of the "Voice of America."

Malik first quoted Stalin's words to U.S. Republican leader Stassen on April 9, 1947: We should avoid excessive indulgence in criticizing other people's systems. History will prove which system is better. People do not have to have completely identical systems in order to cooperate.

Malik also quoted Stalin's words on the Soviet Union's attitude towards small countries when the Soviet Union and Finland signed an agreement in April 1948: The Soviet people believe that every country—no matter how big or small—has its own distinctive nature, its own unique characteristics that are possessed by no other country, and these characteristics are each country's contribution to the treasure house of world culture.

Ecuadorian Representative Quevedo expressed his gratitude to Malik for his explanation. He said: The Ecuadorian delegation consistently respects other delegations and hopes to receive their respect.

After Malik and Quevedo made their remarks, the Security Council voted on the U.S. proposal.

After the U.S. proposal was rejected, Jebb suggested voting on the Soviet proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War. Jebb insisted that the Security Council had decided to hear the opinion of the representative of "the Republic of Korea" and suggested that Malik delete the words in the Soviet proposal suggesting that the opinion of the representatives of the Korean people should also be heard.

Malik replied: The Soviet Union has already expressed its opinion on this issue, and the Soviet Union believes that the Security Council's invitation to South Korea on June 25th was illegal. He said: The Soviet Union insists that the Security Council vote on the original text of the Soviet proposal.

Chairman Jebb said: If the Soviet proposal is put to a vote as a whole, Jebb is willing to do so, but only on the premise that the ruling of September 1st remains in effect (this ruling decided that regardless of the outcome of the vote, the invitation previously extended to Rhee Syngman's representative will remain valid). Thus, under the domination of the U.S. delegation, the Security Council rejected the Soviet proposal for a peaceful resolution of the Korean War. During the voting, the Soviet Union voted in favor, Egypt and Yugoslavia abstained, and other countries opposed. The Security Council then adjourned and will reconvene on September 7th.

### 安理会继续讨论朝鲜战争问题  苏代表以否决权击败美国提案  在美国支配下竟也否决了和平解决朝鲜战争提案

　　安理会继续讨论朝鲜战争问题
    苏代表以否决权击败美国提案
    在美国支配下竟也否决了和平解决朝鲜战争提案
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社纽约七日讯：联合国安全理事会于九月六日开会，继续讨论朝鲜战争问题。
    在通过议程（与九月五日会议的议程一样）后，苏联代表马立克要求安理会主席杰伯请助理秘书长宣读苏联政府致安理会主席的公函，该函内容包括苏联政府致美国的关于十一架美国战斗机无端袭击未武装的苏联教练机的照会副本。
    在该函宣读后，杰伯建议，安理会在讨论朝鲜战争时应审议苏联的公函，就像以前同意审议美国关于击落苏联飞机的公函一样。
    马立克提出规则问题，指出苏联政府把苏联致美国政府的照会原文通知安理会理事国，与美国以前致安理会的公函无关，并且未说要由安理会讨论此照会。
    马立克重申：苏联政府的照会是致美国政府的，所以它是两国政府间的问题，而不是由安理会讨论的问题。但美国代表奥斯汀断言，苏联代表的公函是致安理会的，所以应由安理会决定如何处理之。
    奥斯汀试图把攻击苏联飞机的责任推在联合国身上，硬说自一九四七年以来美国政府在朝鲜的一切行动就是联合国的行动。他说：苏联的公函在安理会中，美国将在适当的时候要求在安理会里进行讨论。
    马立克指出：美国代表的论点中，并没有什么新鲜东西，他一直试图用联合国的招牌掩饰美国自从一九四七年以来在朝鲜的一切行动。马立克说：既然美国现在正对朝鲜的城市、乡村及和平居民进行野蛮的轰炸从而杀害朝鲜人民，美国代表力图用联合国的盾牌和旗帜掩饰美国在朝鲜的一切行动是不足为奇的。但是苏联政府认为：美国政府对于美国军事当局的行动应负完全责任，美国军事当局已因为这种明目张胆地破坏国际法而自贻羞辱。苏联政府坚持：惩办这一罪行的肇事者并且赔偿一架飞机被毁和三名机员死难的损失。他在结语中称：这些是美国军事当局所做出的行动而美国政府应对之负完全责任，而且这些行动是和联合国毫不相干的。
    在马立克发言后，杰伯说：当美国提出关于飞机事件的照会时他已经建议讨论“控诉对大韩民国的侵略案”时审议。因此，他裁决苏联照会以及美国照会都予以审议。
    马立克回答说：杰伯的声明是不确实的，因为第一，苏联代表团从来没有说过它赞成讨论美国的照会。第二，这个问题与杰伯引证的议程项目毫无关系。第三，假使安理会的一个理事国想要讨论什么问题，那是他们的权利，但这并不是说他的声明就是应予审议的问题。
    杰伯于是请古巴代表阿尔渥里兹讨论各项有关朝鲜战争的提案。阿尔渥里兹宣称：他将投票赞成美国提案。
    国民党代表蒋廷黻在冗长的反苏演说中说：他将支持美国的提案，尽管该提案并“不充分”。
    埃及代表法齐与厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎也赞同美国的提案。奎维铎说：朝鲜人民政府对轰炸与杀害和平居民的抗议非等到安理会获得“联合国司令部”关于此事的意见后不应处理。
    李承晚集团的代表张勉继即表示希望：安理会各会员国将投票赞成美国的提案并否决苏联的提案。
    马立克立即要求阐明虽然张勉非法地出席安理会讨论会，但是他的地位仅限于向安全理事会提作申述，而并不包括就提案发表意见。马立克宣称：张勉的意见任何人都不感兴趣。
    杰伯在其答复中硬说不是这样，并宣布：联合王国将投票赞成美国的提案，反对苏联的提案。杰伯继即提议表决美国提案。
    马立克指出在九月五日的会议中，大家同意依照提案提出的先后次序在辩论结束后举行表决。他说，因此，他将同意表决美国的提案和第一个苏联提案。不过，他决定就苏联关于轰炸和平居民的第二个提案作一发言，以便说明苏联代表所以提出这个提案的理由。他表示愿意在举行任何表决之前或在美国提案与第一个苏联的提案付诸表决后发表这种声明。
    杰伯说，苏联代表“可能是对的”，于是他建议安理会表决美国提案，然后“考虑是否可以”休会。
    马立克说，如果举行表决，美国的提案与苏联的第一个提案都应付诸表决。
    安理会于是表决美国在“局部化”的借口下为扩大并加深朝鲜战争提出的所谓“控诉对大韩民国的侵略”案。苏联投票反对这个提案，因此在大国一致原则下击败了这一提案。投票赞成这个提案的包括美国、联合王国、法国、挪威、国民党、厄瓜多尔、古巴、埃及和印度。南斯拉夫弃权。
    在美国提案提付表决之前，马立克要求有机会简单地答复厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎的两点说法。马立克说这种说法近似诽谤苏联与苏联人民。马立克在引述奎维铎关于所谓苏联并不对其他国家的哲学表示容忍，而且对小国家表现藐视的说法后指出：他这一次倒不认为厄瓜多尔代表是存心诽谤，而勿宁说他是缺乏了解。他说：这一方面是因为厄瓜多尔与苏联的距离太远，另一方面也是因为厄瓜多尔和厄瓜多尔人民必须在“美国之音”的不断的含有敌意的反苏宣传之下生活和工作。
    马立克首先引证斯大林在一九四七年四月九日对美国共和党领袖史塔生所讲的话：我们应该避免过度耽于批评别人的制度。历史会证明哪一个制度好些。人们不必因为要合作就必须有完全相同的制度。
    马立克又引证斯大林在一九四八年四月当苏联与芬兰签订协定时就苏联对小国的态度所讲的话：苏联人民认为每一个国家——不论大小——都有它自己特出的性质，它自己所独有而为其他国家所无的特性，这些特性就是每一个国家对世界文化宝库的贡献。
    厄瓜多尔代表奎维铎对马立克的解释表示感谢。他说：厄瓜多尔代表团一贯地尊敬其他的代表团，并希望得到它们的尊敬。
    在马立克与奎维铎发表谈话以后，安理会就表决美国的提案。
    在美国提案被否决以后，杰伯建议表决苏联所提关于和平解决朝鲜战争的提案。杰伯硬说安理会已决定听取“大韩民国”代表的意见，并建议马立克取消苏联提案中所提允宜听取朝鲜人民代表的意见的字句。
    马立克答称：苏联已经在这个问题上表示过意见，苏联认为安理会在六月二十五日向南朝鲜发出的邀请是非法的。他说：苏联坚持安理会表决苏联的提案原案。
    主席杰伯说：如果将苏联的提案作为一个整体来付诸表决，杰伯愿意这样做，但必须有一个前提，即：九月一日的裁决仍然有效（此项裁决决定：不论表决的结果如何，从前向李承晚代表发出的邀请将继续有效）。于是，在美国代表团的支配之下，安理会否决了苏联的和平解决朝鲜战争的提案。投票时，苏联赞成，埃及及南斯拉夫弃权，其他国家反对，安理会随即休会，至九月七日再开。
