    US, Britain, and France to Hold Foreign Ministers' Meeting
    Attempting to Advance Expanded Aggression Plans
    Facing the Powerful Resistance of People Worldwide, Unable to Attend to Both the West and the East
    [Xinhua News Agency, September 9th] The US State Department and the British and French Foreign Ministries recently announced that the foreign ministers of the US, Britain, and France will hold their second meeting of the year in New York from September 12th to 14th, before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly (September 19th). Simultaneously, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) aggressive bloc is scheduled to hold its fifth council meeting, attended by the foreign ministers of twelve countries, from September 15th to 16th. To this end, officials from the US, Britain, and France began a preparatory meeting for the three foreign ministers' meeting in Washington on August 30th.
    These two high-level meetings of the imperialist bloc were originally decided upon at the London Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting and the Fourth Council Meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in May of this year. The purpose at that time was to solve the tasks that the London meeting failed to complete and to accelerate the pace of war preparations worldwide. However, since then, the United States has launched a war of aggression against Korea and carried out armed aggression against China's territory of Taiwan. Other imperialist countries such as Britain and France have also participated in the war of aggression against Korea under US coercion. Now, on the one hand, US imperialism is trying to expand this war, but on the other hand, it has suffered serious military and political failures due to the powerful resistance from the Korean people, the Chinese people, and the people of the world in various aspects, thereby causing increasingly growing contradictions within the imperialist camp. Therefore, various sources reveal that the primary purpose of the United States at this three foreign ministers' meeting and the NATO Council meeting will be to rectify the increasingly chaotic steps within the imperialist camp, further coerce Britain, France, and other vassal states to support its war of aggression in the Far East, and seek to "unify" its steps at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly in order to oppose the just accusations of the Chinese and Korean peoples against US aggression, which have been put forward by the Soviet Union. Agence France-Presse (AFP) Washington dispatch on September 3rd stated: "The Far East issue will occupy a primary position in the three foreign ministers' meeting." According to AFP, the issues on the agenda are primarily the Korean issue, and closely related to this are: "The question of Taiwan's future, the issue of a peace treaty with Japan, the issue of China's representation in the United Nations," and the issue of providing military and economic assistance to Southeast Asian puppet governments, etc. Reuters Washington dispatch on August 31st further stated that the preparatory meeting for the three foreign ministers' meeting, which is currently being held in Washington, is "seeking a plan to coordinate policies on Taiwan."
    In addition, another purpose of the United States at the New York meeting will still be to continue its line at the last London meeting, further integrating West Germany into the Western European war machine and making it its backbone. US Secretary of State Acheson announced at a press conference on September 6th that the three foreign ministers would discuss the issue of arming West Germany, and openly clamored that "it is very important to find a suitable way for Germany to participate in Western European defense." Acheson also explicitly declared that at the New York meeting, the "scope and scale of the German issue may be larger than what has been discussed at past foreign ministers' meetings."
    This New York meeting will be an important step for the United States to advance its warmongering aggression plans worldwide. However, the United States is facing the powerful resistance of people worldwide and the serious difficulty of its own weak strength. An AFP dispatch on September 6th quoted Washington sources as saying that the "main characteristic" of this New York meeting will be "the issue of the United States' strength being divided between the East and the West." These Washington sources acknowledged that "the United States cannot provide Europe with all the necessary assistance, mainly because it has its own obligations in Asia." "The United States is determined to send as much assistance as possible—including the army—to Europe, but these troops can only be sent if it does not harm more urgent needs such as the Korean War, and when the mobilization of US industry and armed forces reaches a peak sufficient to cope with the needs of both the East and the West." Attending to the East but not the West, attending to the West but not the East, in reality, being unable to attend to both the East and the West - this is the unsolvable contradiction and distress of the American aggressors, who have already made enemies on all sides and cannot extricate themselves, when advancing their aggression plans.

### 美英法将举行外长会议  图推进扩大侵略计划  面临全世界人民的强大抗击既顾不了西方也顾不了东方

　　美英法将举行外长会议
    图推进扩大侵略计划
    面临全世界人民的强大抗击既顾不了西方也顾不了东方
    【新华社九日讯】美国国务院与英法两国外交部最近宣布：美英法三国外长将于联合国大会开幕（九月十九日）以前自九月十二日至十四日在纽约举行本年第二次会议，同时北大西洋公约侵略集团亦定于十五至十六日举行由十二国外长参加的第五次理事会议。美、英、法三国官员为此已于八月三十日起在华盛顿举行三外长会议预备会议。
    帝国主义集团的这两个高级会议，原是在今年五月伦敦三外长会议与北大西洋公约第四次理事会议上就决定召开的，当时的目的是为了要解决伦敦会议所未能完成的任务，加紧在全世界的备战步骤。但是，从那时以来，美国已对朝鲜发动了侵略战争，对中国领土台湾实行了武装侵略，英、法等其他帝国主义国家也已在美国胁迫下参加了对朝鲜的侵略战争。现在，美帝国主义一方面正力图扩大这一战争，但是另一方面却由于朝鲜人民、中国人民与全世界人民各方面的强大抗击而连续在军事上与政治上遭到严重的失败，并从而引起了帝国主义阵营内部日益增长的矛盾。因此各方消息透露，美国在这次三外长会议与北大西洋公约理事会上的首要目的，将是整顿帝国主义阵营内部日益混乱的步骤，进一步胁迫英法及其他附庸国家支持其在远东的侵略战争，并寻求在即将开幕的联合国大会上的步调“一致”，以反对已由苏联提出的中国人民与朝鲜人民对美国侵略的正义的控诉。法新社九月三日华盛顿消息即称：“远东问题在三外长会议中将占有首要地位”。据法新社透露，在议程上的问题首先是朝鲜问题，与此紧密联系的有：“关于台湾前途的问题，对日和约问题，中国出席联合国问题”，以及给予东南亚傀儡政府以军事及经济援助问题等。路透社八月三十一日华盛顿电更称：现已在华盛顿进行的三外长会议预备会议，正在“寻觅协调对台湾政策的方案。”
    此外，美国在纽约会议上的另一目的，仍然将是继续其在上次伦敦会议上的路线，进一步使西德参加西欧战争机器并成为其骨干。美国国务卿艾奇逊已于九月六日在记者招待会上宣布三外长将讨论武装西德的问题，并公然叫嚣“找到一个适当的办法使德国能够参加西欧防务是很重要的。”艾奇逊还明白宣称在纽约会议上，德国“问题的范围与规模可能比过去外长会议中所讨论的都大”。
    这次纽约会议将是美国企图在全世界推进其好战侵略计划的一个重要步骤。但是美国却面临着全世界人民的强大抗击与自身力量薄弱的严重困难。法新社九月六日电曾引华盛顿人士的意见称：此次纽约会议“主要的特点”，将是“美国力量分用于东西两方的问题”。这些华盛顿人士承认：“美国不能供给欧洲一切必要的援助，主要因为它在亚洲有它自己的义务。”“美国决心以可能的最大援助——包括陆军，派往欧洲，但这些部队唯有在不致使更迫切的需要如朝鲜战争因此受到损害的情况下，以及当美国工业和武装部队的动员达到足以应付东西两方面需要的高峰时才能派遣。”顾了东方顾不了西方，顾了西方又顾不了东方，实际上是既顾不了东方，也顾不了西方，这就是业已四面树敌，不能自拔的美国侵略者在推进其侵略计划时无法解决的矛盾和苦闷。
