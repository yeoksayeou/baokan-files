Xinhua News Agency, 13th. Since mid-August, new cotton has been successively put on the market, and state-owned yarn and fabric companies in various places are now actively carrying out purchasing work.

This year, new cotton has been put on the market earlier and in larger quantities in various places, because the cotton-grain price ratio is higher, and cotton farmers are happy to sell in order to buy grain. In late August, the daily amount of new cotton on the market in Shanxi and Henan provinces each reached about 200,000 jin, and the daily amount on the market in Linqing area of Hebei reached more than 100,000 jin. Nanguan, Handan, and Shijiazhuang also had tens of thousands of jin on the market every day. In addition, some areas (such as the Northwest region and Shanxi province) had early-maturing new cotton due to drought, so they were put on the market more than half a month earlier than expected. After new cotton was put on the market, yarn and fabric companies in various places immediately grasped reasonable prices and purchased new cotton in large quantities. In total, the amount of cotton purchased nationwide excluding the Northeast in August exceeded the original plan by more than double, of which the amount purchased in late August reached 10 million jin, more than the planned purchase amount for the entire month.

When new cotton was put on the market in various places, it coincided with the widespread bumper harvest of grain across the country, and grain prices once fell in August, thus forming a phenomenon that cotton prices were generally high in the cotton-grain price ratio in various places. For example, in Shijiazhuang, each jin of ginned cotton could be exchanged for 12.9 jin of millet, and in Linfen and other places, each jin of cotton could be exchanged for more than 12 jin of millet. In Xinxiang, it once reached 14.7 jin; in rice areas such as Hankou, each jin of cotton could once be exchanged for 10.3 jin of rice. The Trade Department of the Central People's Government and the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Corporation, in view of the fact that the continued development of this trend would be detrimental to industrial and agricultural production, have made appropriate adjustments since the beginning of September. After the adjustment, the price of each jin of cotton in Xinxiang and Shijiazhuang can be exchanged for about 10.4 jin of millet, while in Taiyuan, Linqing, and other places, it can be exchanged for 10 jin, and in Hankou in the Central South region, each jin of cotton can be exchanged for about 8.5 jin of rice. The adjusted cotton price is more reasonable than in August, and the cotton-grain price ratio still maintains a high standard.

On the other hand, in some areas, when new cotton was put on the market in large quantities, due to the failure of state-owned yarn and fabric companies to allocate funds in a timely manner or the failure to set up institutions, or the lack of market grain supply, private merchants lowered prices to purchase or grain prices rose. In response to the above situation, China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Corporation in various places is now actively strengthening institutions, rationally controlling prices, allocating funds, and continuing to purchase new cotton in large quantities; at the same time, with the cooperation of state-owned grain, department store, coal, and salt specialized companies, they continue to transfer large amounts of grain, department stores, coal, salt, and other materials to cotton-producing areas, preparing to recover most of the cash invested in cotton purchases, so as to avoid price fluctuations due to the concentration of currency in cotton areas. In addition, various places are now beginning to pay attention to market management, prevent speculation and panic buying, and vigorously advocate cotton joint purchase work in cities with concentrated textile industries, in order to ensure the appropriate distribution of textile raw materials under the principle of overall consideration of public and private interests.

According to this year's national cotton production estimate of about 15 million dan, of which about 10 million dan can be used for textiles. This number is sufficient to guarantee the annual needs of the more than 4.2 million spindles currently operating in the country.

　　今年棉产足供一年纺织需用
    国营公司大力开展收购
    粮棉比价曾一度发生不正常现象，经调整后已趋合理。
    【新华社十三日讯】八月中旬以来新棉已先后上市，各地国营花纱布公司现正积极开展收购工作。
    今年各地新棉上市较早，数量亦多，原因是棉粮比价较高，棉农乐于出售，以便换购粮食。八月下旬山西、河南两省每日上市新棉都各达二十万斤左右，河北临清一带每日上市也达十多万斤，南宫、邯郸、石家庄每日亦有数万斤上市。此外部分地区（如西北区及山西省等地）则因气候亢旱，新棉早熟，因而比预期早半个多月上市。各地花纱布公司在新棉上市后即掌握合理价格，大量收购新棉。总计八月份全国除东北外购棉超过原定计划一倍以上，其中八月下旬收购量即达一千万斤，比全月预定收购量还多。
    各地新棉上市时，适值全国粮产普告丰收，八月份粮价曾一度下跌，因此形成各地棉粮比价中棉价一般偏高的现象。如石家庄每斤皮棉可换小米十二斤九两，临汾等地每斤棉花都可换值小米十二斤以上，新乡曾达十四斤七两；大米区如汉口每斤棉花曾可换大米十斤三两。中央人民政府贸易部及中国花纱布公司鉴于这一趋势的继续发展将不利于工农业生产，因此自九月初以来即予以适当调整。调整后新乡、石家庄两地每斤棉价可换小米十斤四两上下，太原、临清等地可换十斤，中南区汉口每斤棉花可换大米八斤半左右。经调整后的棉价较之八月份更趋合理，至今棉粮比价仍保持较高标准。
    另一方面，在有些地区，当新棉大量上市时，由于国营花纱布公司未及时调拨资金或未设置机构，或市场粮食供应不济，曾发生私商压价收购或粮价上涨的现象。针对上述情况，各地中国花纱布公司现正积极加强机构，合理掌握价格，调拨资金，继续大量收购新棉；同时在国营粮食、百货、煤、盐等专业公司的配合下，续向产棉区调运大量粮食、百货、煤、盐等物资，准备将大部投出的购棉现金回笼，以免因棉区货币集中而影响物价波动。此外，各地现正开始注意市场管理，防制投机抢购，并在各纺织业集中的城市大力倡导棉花联购工作，以期在公私统筹兼顾的原则下，保证纺织原料的适当分配。
    按今年全国棉产估计达一千五百万担左右，其中约一千万担可供纺织之用。此数足可保证全国现在运转着的四百二十多万枚纱锭一年之需。
