　　Bo'ai Xiaoyi Village Cadres Overcome "Going It Alone" Work Style
    Complete Urgent Tasks Such as Flood Control and Production on Time
    Mainly Achieved by Clearly Defining Responsibilities and Appropriately Arranging Work
    [This newspaper's news] Huanghe Flood Control Headquarters News Group reported: In leading the Xiaoyi Village, Third District of Bo'ai, Pingyuan Province, attention was paid to appropriately arranging work and assigning responsibilities, ensuring that flood control, production, and the summer grain tax were not neglected, overcoming the "going it alone" work style prevalent among lower-level cadres in the Huanghe flood control work, where one task was done at the expense of others.
    Xiaoyi Village, Third District of Bo'ai, is a village close to the Qin River (Editor's note: The Qin River is a major tributary of the Huanghe River, and the Qin River flood control work is under the unified command of the Huanghe Flood Control Headquarters). On July 16th, the village held a meeting of cadres to study the integration of the three major tasks of the summer grain tax, flood control, and production. At that time, some people felt that these three tasks were urgent and too large, and they lacked confidence in completing them on time through integration. The village Party branch secretary, Lin Shilu, and others explained that the government's call for production and flood control were both for the benefit of the people, which ultimately convinced everyone. Immediately afterward, research was conducted separately at the village Party branch and the village people's representative meeting. After heated discussions, it was decided that the summer grain tax, production, and flood control would be carried out simultaneously. Village cadres would be assigned to take charge of each task, ensuring that none were neglected. The village head and the appraisal committee would lead the summer grain tax and production; Party branch secretary Lin Shilu and deputy village head Chang Peibi would lead flood control. At the same time, based on the actual situation, the working hours were scheduled in a planned manner, and it was decided that weeding would be completed within three days from July 18th to 19th, and after the 19th, efforts would be concentrated on completing the remaining project of repairing the embankment line. The plan also anticipated that if weeding could not be completed within three days, priority would be given to weeding silted land first, followed by sandy land, and it was called for mutual aid and labor exchange to strive for timely completion of all weeding. Preparations and mobilization were carried out among the masses in advance. After such arrangements and mobilization, the masses fully supported it. The masses then began weeding intensely, going out early and returning late, and some even ate their meals in the fields, and by the 20th, all the urgent work in the village's fields was completed. In this way, not only was production not delayed, but flood control promoted production. In the work of repairing the embankment line, the village first had deputy village head Chang Peibi lead several people to mark the soil extraction points, soil dumping points, and access roads for each section of the project, and then Lin Shilu led the specific division of labor. After the work started, the enthusiasm of the masses was very high, and as a result, the three-day task was completed in two and a half days. At present, the village's flood control organization has been established, and the temporary flood control personnel include fourteen small teams of young and middle-aged people, totaling thirty-four people, ten small teams of elderly people, totaling seventy-eight people, and four small teams of children, totaling fifty-eight people, totaling twenty-eight small teams of one hundred and seventy people, all under the unified leadership of the village brigade.
    Editor's note: In flood control, production, and other work, cadres in various places, due to heavy tasks, tight deadlines, and a lack of skill in appropriately arranging work, have created contradictions between flood control and production. From the facts of Xiaoyi Village in Bo'ai, it seems that as long as the leadership can clearly define responsibilities, mobilize the masses, and arrange work in a step-by-step and planned manner, this contradiction can be completely overcome.

　　博爱孝义村干部克服“单打一”工作作风
    按时完成防汛生产等紧迫任务
    主要是作到明确分工适当安排工作
    【本报讯】黄河防汛总指挥部通讯组报道：平原省博爱三区孝义村领导上，注意适当安排工作，分工负责，作到防汛、生产、夏征三不误，克服了在黄河防汛工作中下级干部普遍存在的作一件丢一件的“单打一”的工作作风。
    博爱三区孝义村，是靠近沁河的一个村庄（编者按：沁河为黄河一大支流，沁河防汛工作受黄河防汛指挥部统一指挥）。该村于七月十六日，召开村干部会，研究夏征、防汛、生产三大任务结合问题。当时开始有些人感觉这三个工作都很紧迫，任务太大，对三者结合按时完成缺乏信心。该村支部书记林世禄等说明政府号召生产，防汛都是为了老百姓，最后打通了大家的思想。紧接着就在村支部与村人民代表会议上分别进行研究，经热烈讨论后，决定夏征、生产、防汛同时进行。由村干部分头负责，切实作到三不误。村长及评议委员会领导夏征、生产；支部书记林世禄及副村长常佩璧领导防汛。同时根据实际情况，有计划的把工作时间排列开，决定七月十八日至十九日三天内完成锄苗，十九日以后集中力量完成修整堤线残余工程。计划内并估计到如果三天内不能全部完成锄苗，即先锄淤地，后锄沙地，并号召变工互助，争取按时全部锄完。在群众中预先进行了酝酿和动员。经过这样安排动员后，完全得到了群众的支持。群众便紧张的开始锄苗，早去晚归，有的饭都在地里吃，至二十日全村地里的紧活全部干完。这样不但未耽误生产，而且防汛推动了生产。在修整堤线工作中，该村首先由副村长常佩璧带领数人，将各段工程起土、倒土地点、往来道路等按设标志，另由林世禄领导具体进行分工。开始工作后群众情绪非常高涨，结果三天任务两天半完成。目前该村防汛组织已建立，临时防汛员已有青壮年队十四个小队，共三十四人，老年班十个小队，七十八人，儿童四个小队，五十八人，共计二十八个小队一百七十人，统一受村大队领导。
    编者按：各地干部在防汛、生产等工作中，由于任务繁忙，时间紧迫，和不善于适当安排工作，以致形成防汛和生产等工作矛盾。从博爱孝义村的事实看来，只要领导上能够作到明确分工，发动群众，有步骤有计划安排工作，这种矛盾是完全可以克服的。
