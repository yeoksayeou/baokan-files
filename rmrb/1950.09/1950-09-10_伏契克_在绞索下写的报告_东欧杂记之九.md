　　Fucik's "Report Written Under the Gallows"
    ——Miscellaneous Notes on Eastern Europe IX
    Feng Zhi
    Editor's Note: Seven years ago, the Hitler bandits murdered Julius Fuchik, the great revolutionary and outstanding journalist of Czechoslovakia. He was a writer beloved by the Czech people, a political leader, the editor-in-chief of the Czech Communist Party's newspaper "Red Power," and a member of the Party Central Committee. During the occupation of Czechoslovakia, he and his comrades heroically led the people of the motherland in a tenacious underground struggle against the Nazi enemy. He was unfortunately arrested in the spring of 1942 and sacrificed on September 8th of the following year. During his imprisonment, he wrote a notebook recording prison life, people, and thoughts, namely the "Report Written Under the Gallows" introduced here. This work has now become a widely circulated reading material for progressive people around the world, and it "rings through Europe like a bell, from this shore to that shore" (Howard Fast). The Czech people, in order to admire Fucik, have designated September 8th as their Journalist's Day. The Czech Embassy in our country held a memorial gathering the day before yesterday.
    In Czechoslovakia, there are few who do not know the name Julius Fuchik. He is a good example for young people and journalists. Therefore, Fucik's image is engraved on the "Study Diligently" medal of the Czech Youth League, the most outstanding youth cultural troupe is called the "Fucik Cultural Troupe," and journalists designate his death day, September 8th, as "Journalist's Day," and contributing journalists receive the Fucik Prize on this day every year. On the night we first arrived in Prague, a cadre of the Youth League recommended Fucik's "Report Written Under the Gallows" to us, saying, "This is not an ordinary reportage, it is a classic of the Czech people."
    Fucik (1902-1943) was born in the city of Pilsen, famous for producing beer, was the son of a worker's family, a communist, and worked as a newspaper editor in Prague; he wrote political commentaries, literary reviews, drama reviews, reports on Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, and short stories; he was optimistic, brave, and young. On March 15, 1939, when Fascist Germany occupied the entire territory of Czechoslovakia, this journalist, familiar to many, suddenly disappeared. At the same time, a "Professor Horak" with a full beard, direct gaze, and unrecognized by anyone appeared in Prague or other small Czech towns. This disguised "professor" adopted a detached posture that did not ask about current affairs or politics, avoiding the attention of Nazi agents. But at this time he was actively participating in the Czech people's independence movement, often leading the Czech Communist Party's underground newspaper "Red Power." This newspaper is now the largest, most influential, and must-read newspaper in Czechoslovakia. At that time, underground, due to Fucik's powerful writing, it was also the sharpest anti-fascist weapon. On June 22, 1941, when Hitler attacked the Soviet Union, Fucik distributed leaflets that very night, clarifying the significance of this war. On February 23, 1942, when Stalin delivered that great speech to the Soviet army, readers of "Red Power" were able to read it on the evening of the 24th. The newspaper spread widely, and the work progressed smoothly, but unfortunately, an accidental oversight caused this "Professor Horak" to fall into the hands of Nazi agents on April 24, 1942. The agents recognized him as Fucik and sent him to the Pankrac prison near Prague. He was tortured severely every day, and they asked him to reveal organizational secrets, but he remained silent. He had not been in prison for a month when Heydrich, the head of the Nazi gang in Prague and a notorious executioner, was assassinated. Prague was immediately placed under martial law. During the martial law period, the Nazis retaliated, killing tens of thousands of people and razing the two villages of Lidice and Ležáky near the assassination site of Heydrich to the ground. Every day, many people were taken out of Pankrac prison to be hanged or shot. Fucik was likely to be taken out at any time, but the agents always hoped to get some important secrets from him, so he was left alive. It was also during this period of martial law that, one day unexpectedly, a prison guard gently asked him: "How are you?" Fucik replied: "I don't know. They tell me I'm going to be shot tomorrow." Then the guard said: "Maybe they will. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe later, maybe not at all. But in these times... it's best to be prepared at all times..." He paused for a moment and said: "In case of misfortune... would you like someone to pass some messages to the outside? Or would you like to write something? You need to understand, not for now, but for the future, how you got here, whether someone betrayed you, what the attitude of the people here is... so that what you know doesn't perish with you..."—Then he sent Fucik paper and pencils.
    Fucik always maintained his silence in front of the secret police, but when he held the pencil in his hand and faced the precious paper, he was no longer silent. He began to tell his comrades, the Czech people, and all mankind about the various people in prison, the lovely, the hateful, and the disgusting, and about his great thoughts, his love for the Soviet Union, and his confidence in the future of Czechoslovakia. He wrote some and handed it to the guard to take out secretly and keep it in a safe place. He kept writing until June 9 of the following year, when the agents were about to send him to Berlin. He knew that he would die soon, and he would no longer have the opportunity to write "reports." He ended with these few words:
    "My play is coming to an end. I cannot describe this ending. I do not yet know it. This is no longer a play. This is life.
    "In life, there are no bystanders.
    "The curtain falls.
    "People, I love you. Be vigilant!"
    On September 8, 1943, he was murdered in Berlin. A year and eight months later, the Hitler regime collapsed, Czechoslovakia was liberated, Fucik's wife came out of another concentration camp, found the guard in Pankrac prison that year—his name was Kolinsky—, and pieced together the scattered pages written by Fucik, which is now the Czech people's classic "Report Written Under the Gallows."
    In May, the streets of Prague were filled with happy life, people changed into light spring clothes, and various children's toys, glass, and pottery were displayed in some shop windows. Many people had been whipped by the Nazi bandits during the war and lived in secret police concentration camps. They are now happy and healthy, and it seems that for the promising construction of the motherland, no one wants to recall the gloomy and cold stories of the past at work. But if they are accidentally mentioned Fucik, they immediately become serious. This seriousness contains two different emotions: grief and respect. They grieve that such an outstanding son of the Czech people suffered so much unimaginable devastation and torture at the hands of Nazi agents; they respect this loyal and patriotic Communist who showed such a lofty spirit under indescribable physical pain, constantly inspiring and educating them. One relatively free day in mid-May, I bought the German translation of this "Report" in a bookstore in Prague. Back in the hotel, I opened it to read. This book tied me from the first page, sentence after sentence, paragraph after paragraph, chapter after chapter, there was no place that could make me put it down, until the last line: "People, I love you. Be vigilant!"—Every word radiated the smell of blood and the light of loyalty. When I finished reading, I opened the window and looked at the happy and busy life coming and going on the streets of Prague, "People, I love you. Be vigilant!" This sentence replaced thousands of words, and the author's last sentence kept churning in my heart.
    From this day on, I wanted to read one or two paragraphs from this book whenever I had time, because almost every paragraph is a beautiful and lofty poem. He wrote about how the comrades in prison communicated with each other and formed a great collective, how the secret police were inhumane, how several "guards" like Kolinsky secretly assisted the victims in prison, and some cowards who pleased both sides, "If you are drowning, they stand by, if you are close to the river bank, they hand you a hand." He also wrote about the firmness of many people who were unyielding until death. During the martial law period, Czechs were killed in the hundreds and thousands. A revolutionary fighter said to the agents before his death: "This is useless to you. Many of us will have to sacrifice, but in the end, it is you who will be defeated..." When Fucik was interrogated, the agents asked him: "Don't you understand? This is the end, do you understand, you have lost everything."
    "Only I have lost," Fucik said.
    "So you still believe in the victory of the Communist Party?"
    "Of course."
    "Still believe in the victory of Russia?"
    "Of course. The war cannot have any other ending."
    If such a book were to record all the touching places, it would be equivalent to copying or translating the entire book from beginning to end. Now I will only record two paragraphs about "May Day" below. Fucik spent two "May Days" in prison. On the first "May Day," he had only been in prison for a week and had almost died from torture. He wrote his thoughts that day:
    "May 1st! At this time, we have risen up around many cities, ready with our flags. At this time, the first teams on the streets of Moscow have already gone to the parade ground, and now hundreds of millions of people are engaged in the final struggle for the freedom of mankind, and millions of people are sacrificed in this struggle. I am one of them. Acting as one of them, acting as one of the soldiers in the final war, is wonderful."
    On "May Day" in 1943, it happened to be Kolinsky's day on duty. Fucik said that this was a blessing. On this day, there was another moment to act as a Communist journalist, writing a report describing the May Day parade of fighting forces in this new world. He reported this way:
    "Now is our morning walk. I practice first. Children, today is May Day, we are starting some different movements from the past, although the guards are surprised. The first movement, one, two, one, two, hitting the hammer. The second movement, harvesting. Hammer and sickle. With some imagination, comrades will understand. Hammer and sickle. I look around. They smile and excitedly repeat these exercises. They understand: this is our May Day congress, this pantomime—is our May Day oath, even if we go to death, we will always be loyal.
    "Back in the cell. Nine o'clock. Now the Kremlin clock is striking ten, and the parade is starting on Red Square (note). Father, we walk together! The Internationale is being sung there, and now the Internationale is resounding throughout the world, and it should also be sung from our cells. We sing. Then one revolutionary song follows another, we don't want to be alone, we are not alone, we belong to those who are now singing freely and fighting like us..."
    (Note) Prague time is one hour later than Moscow time.
    (Postscript) Back in Beijing, I learned that this book has a Chinese translation, titled "Report When the Noose is Around the Neck," translated by Liu Liaoyi from Russian, published by Dalian Guanghua Bookstore in 1948. The translations quoted in this miscellaneous note are based on the German version and refer to the Chinese translation. It is difficult to find the Chinese translation in bookstores in Beijing. Later, Comrade Wu Boxiao sent me a copy he had collected from Changchun, so that I could read the Chinese translation. I am very grateful to him.

　　伏契克“在绞索下写的报告”
    ——东欧杂记之九
    冯至
    编者按：七年前，希特勒匪徒在集中营里屠杀了捷克斯洛伐克的伟大革命者和卓越的新闻记者尤利乌斯·伏契克（Julius Fuchik）。他是捷克人民爱戴的作家、政治领袖、捷克共产党机关报《红色权力》的主编和党中央委员。在捷克沦陷期间，他和他的同志们英勇地领导祖国人民与纳粹敌人作顽强的地下斗争。不幸在一九四二年的春天被捕，到次年九月八日牺牲。在囚禁期间他写了一部记载狱中生活、人物和思想的笔记，即这里介绍的“在绞索下的报告”。现在这部著作已经成为世界进步人民传诵的读物，它“像钟声一样响彻着欧洲，从此岸到彼岸”（哈华特·法斯特）。捷克人民为了崇敬伏契克，已把九月八日定为他们的记者节。前天捷克驻我国大使馆曾举行纪念集会。
    在捷克斯洛伐克很少有不知道尤利乌斯·伏契克这个名字的。他是青年和新闻记者的好榜样，所以捷克青年联盟“学习优良”的奖章上刻着伏契克的像，最卓越的青年文工团被称为“伏契克文工团”，新闻工作者把他的死日，九月八日，定为“记者节”，有贡献的新闻记者每年在这天获得伏契克奖金。我们刚到布拉格的那天晚上，一个青年联盟的干部就向我们推荐伏契克《在绞索下写的报告》，他说，“这不是普通一般的报告文学了，是捷克人民的经典。”
    伏契克（一九○二——一九四三）生在产啤酒出名的皮尔森城，是一个工人家庭的儿子，共产党员，在布拉格作报纸编辑；他写过政论，文评，剧评，关于捷克和苏联的报告，短篇小说；他乐观，勇敢，年青。一九三九年三月十五日法西斯德国占领了捷克全境，这个许多人都熟悉的新闻记者忽然不见了，同时在布拉格或其他捷克的小城中出现了一个满面胡须，目光直视，谁也不认识的“荷拉克教授”。这个伪装的“教授”作出一种不问时事，不问政治的超然姿态，躲避了纳粹特务的注意。但他这时正积极参加捷克人民的独立运动，经常领导着捷克共产党的地下报纸《红色权力报》。这报纸如今在捷克斯洛伐克是一份最大、最有影响，人人必读的报纸，那时在地下由于伏契克有力的文字也是一件最锋锐的反法西斯的武器。一九四一年六月二十二日希特勒进攻苏联，当天晚上伏契克就散发传单，阐明这次战争的意义。一九四二年二月二十三日斯大林向苏军发表了那伟大的演说词，《红色权力报》的读者在二十四日晚就能够读到。报纸广泛地传播着，工作也顺利进行，但不幸一件偶然的疏忽使这个“荷拉克教授”于一九四二年四月二十四日落在纳粹特务的手里了。特务们认出他是伏契克，把他送入布拉格附近潘克拉斯地方的监狱。每天严刑拷问，叫他说出组织上的机密，他始终保持沉默。他在狱里没满一个月，纳粹匪帮在布拉格的首领，著名的刽子手海特利许被刺了，布拉格立即戒严。在戒严期内，纳粹实行报复，杀戮了成千成万的人，把海特利许被刺处附近的两个村落里狄斯和雷察基夷为平地，从潘克拉斯监狱里每天都有不少的人被拉出去绞死或枪毙。伏契克随时都有被拉出去的可能，但是特务们总希望能够从他口里得到一些重要的机密，所以他留下来没有死去。也正是在这戒严时期，一天出乎意外，一个狱里的监视人轻轻问他：“你怎么样？”伏契克回答：“我不知道。他们告诉我，我明天就要枪毙。”随后监视人说：“可能他们这样做。也许不是明天，也许迟些天，也许根本不。但是在这些时候……最好时时准备着……”他沉默了片刻又说：“万一不幸……你愿意让人向外面传递一些消息吗？或是你愿意写些东西？你要了解，不是为了现在，是为了将来，你怎么到这里来的，是否有人出卖了你，这里人们都是什么态度……使你知道的不至于和你一起沦亡……”——随后他就给伏契克送来了纸和铅笔。
    伏契克在特务警察面前始终保持他的沉默，但当他手里握着铅笔，面对这宝贵的纸张时他就不沉默了，他起始向着他的同志，向着捷克人民和全人类述说狱里的形形色色，可爱的，可憎恨的，以及可嫌厌的人物，述说他伟大的思想，对于苏联的热爱与对于捷克将来的信心。他写完一些，就交给那个监视人偷偷地带出去，放在安全的地方保存起来。一直写到第二年的六月九日，特务们要把他解往柏林，他知道不久就要死去，此后他再也没有机会写“报告”了，他用这样几句话作了结束：
    “我这出戏也要终结了。我不能描写这个终结。我还不知道它。这再也不是戏。这是生活。
    “在生活里没有旁观者。
    “幕落下来。
    “人们，我爱你们。你们要警惕！”
    一九四三年九月八日，他在柏林被害。过了一年又八个月，希特勒政权崩溃，捷克斯洛伐克解放，伏契克的夫人从另一个集中营里出来，找到当年潘克拉斯监狱里的监视人——他的名字叫柯林斯基——，把伏契克写的零张碎页连缀在一起，就是这部如今成为捷克人民的经典的“在绞索下写的报告”。
    在五月，布拉格的大街上充溢着快乐的生活，行人都换上轻便的春服，一些商店陈列窗里摆出各色各样的儿童玩具，玻璃和陶制的器皿。有不少的人在战争时期受过纳粹匪徒的鞭打，住过特务的集中营，他们如今都快乐，健康，好像为了祖国前途无量的建设，在工作中谁也不愿意回想过去的那些阴惨而冰冷的故事。但若是偶然和他们提起伏契克，他们便立即变得严肃了。这严肃包含着两种不同的情感：悲悼与尊敬。他们悲悼这样一个优越的捷克人民的儿子在纳粹的特务那里受到那么多难以想像的摧残与折磨；他们尊敬这个忠贞爱国的共产党人在身体难以形容的痛苦下表现了那样崇高的精神，不断地在启发他们，教育他们。我在五月中旬比较空暇的一天，在布拉格一家书店里，买到这部“报告”的德文译本。回到旅馆里就打开来读。这本书从第一页起就把我系住了，一句接着一句，一段接着一段，一章接着一章，没有一个地方能够使我把它放下，一直读到最后的一行：“人们，我爱你们。你们要警惕！”——其中每个字都放射着血的气味与忠贞的光芒。当我读完了，把窗子打开，望着布拉格大街上来来往往，快乐而匆忙的生活，“人们，我爱你们。你们要警惕！”这句代替了千言万语，作者最后的一句话不住地在我心里翻腾着。
    从这天起，我得暇便想从这本书里诵读一两段，因为其中的每一段几乎都是一首美丽而崇高的诗篇。他写着监狱里的同志们怎样声气相通，形成一个伟大的集体，特务警察们是怎样灭绝人性，几个像柯林斯基那样的“监视人”怎样暗地里援助狱中的被难者，还有一些两面讨好的懦夫，“如果你要淹死了，他们袖手旁观，如果你靠近了河岸，他们向你递过来手”。他又写出许多人临死不屈的坚强。在戒严时期捷克人成千成百地被杀戮，一个革命战士在死前对特务说：“这对你们毫无用处。我们有许多人还要牺牲，但是归终被打倒的是你们……”伏契克被审问时，特务们问他：“你难道还不明白吗？这是结局了，你明白吗，你们一切都输了。”
    “只是我输了。”伏契克说。
    “那么你还相信共产党的胜利吗？”
    “当然。”
    “还相信俄国的胜利吗？”
    “当然。战争不能有旁的结局。”
    这样的一本书，如果把它感人的地方都记录下来，就等于把全书从头到尾抄一遍或是翻译一遍。现在我只把两段关于“五一”的文字记在下边。伏契克在狱里度过两次“五一”。第一次的“五一”时，他到狱里刚刚一个星期，被拷打几乎死去了，他写那天的感想：
    “五月一日！这时候我们已经在许多城市的周围起来了，预备好我们的旗帜。这时莫斯科的街上头一批的队伍已经走向检阅场，并且现在这时有千百万人为了人类的自由从事最后的斗争，千万人牺牲在这斗争里。我是他们里边的一个。充作他们里边的一个，充作最后战争的战士里的一个，是美好的。”
    一九四三年的“五一”，正巧柯林斯基值日，伏契克说，这是一个幸福。在这天又有片刻时间充作共产党的新闻记者，写一个报告叙述这个新世界里战斗力量的五月检阅。他这样报告：
    “现在是我们早晨的散步。我先操练。孩子们，今天是五一，我们开始一些与往日不同的动作，虽然守卫们在惊讶。第一个动作，一，二，一，二，打锤头。第二个动作，收割。锤头与镰刀。用一些幻想，同志们就会明白。锤头与镰刀。我向四围看。他们微笑着，并且兴奋地重复这些演习。他们明白了：这是我们的五一大会，这个哑剧——是我们的五一宣誓，纵使我们走向死亡，我们也永久是忠贞的。
    “回到牢房里。九点钟。现在克里姆林宫的钟正敲十下，红场上开始检阅（注）。父亲，我们跟在一起走！那里正在唱国际歌，现在国际歌歌声响彻全世界，它应该也从我们的牢房里唱出来。我们歌唱。于是一个革命歌曲跟着另外的一个，我们不愿意是孤单的，我们并不孤单，我们属于那些现在正自由地歌唱而和我们同样在战斗中的人们……”
    （注）布拉格时间比莫斯科时间晚一小时。
    （附记）回到北京，才知道这本书有中文的译本，书名《绞索勒着脖子时的报告》，刘辽逸自俄文转译，一九四八年大连光华书局出版。这篇杂记里引用的译文，系根据德文版，并参照中译。中译本在北京的书店里很难找到，后来蒙吴伯箫同志从长春把他收藏的一本寄给我，使我能读了一遍中文的翻译，我非常感谢他。
