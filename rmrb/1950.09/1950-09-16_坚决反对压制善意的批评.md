　　The letters from Comrades Lu Bo and Ma Keqiang published in today's issue of this journal, as well as several similar letters published previously, indicate that some leading comrades in certain regions and units still do not understand the significant meaning of展开ing criticism and self-criticism in newspapers and periodicals. Consequently, they are wrongly using various methods and excuses to suppress public criticism of the shortcomings of their own units' work. The most common excuse for suppressing public criticism is to say that such criticism does not conform to organizational discipline, and the error of this excuse has been very clearly explained by this newspaper's mailbox on July 18 in "Does it conform to organizational discipline for a Communist Party member to make criticisms and suggestions to the Party newspaper regarding the work of the government?" Another excuse for suppressing public criticism is to say that the criticism "does not conform to the facts" or "does not completely conform to the facts." If the criticism made by the critic is completely untrue, that is not appropriate; if a newspaper publishes a piece of criticism that is completely untrue, the newspaper must also be responsible for making a public review and correction. But this is not what is happening now. As for whether there are aspects of the criticism that "do not completely conform to the facts," as long as it is well-intentioned, the criticized person should treat it with the attitude of "correcting mistakes if they exist, and being encouraged if they don't," and should never take a rough or indifferent attitude. The CCP Central Committee's "Decision on展开ing Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals" states: "Enabling the people to freely publish their criticisms and suggestions to the Party and the People's Government in newspapers and periodicals, even if these criticisms and suggestions are not completely mature or completely correct, and they will not be attacked or ridiculed because of this, is a serious step towards increasing the people's awareness and enthusiasm and attracting the people to actively participate in the national construction cause. Therefore, the Party's leading organs and cadres at all levels must adopt a revolutionary attitude of warmly welcoming and resolutely protecting criticisms that reflect the opinions of the masses, and oppose the bureaucratic attitude of ignoring, restricting the publication of, and attacking, retaliating against, and ridiculing the critics." Only in this way can we stimulate the enthusiasm of the masses for criticism and universally and deeply展开 mass criticism and self-criticism.
    Facts tell us that to universally and deeply展开 public criticism and self-criticism is by no means an easy task, and serious struggle must be waged against those who resist and suppress well-intentioned criticism. In order to accomplish this task, newspapers must assume their due responsibilities and play their due roles. While newspapers should not irresponsibly publish criticisms that violate principles, they must also never adopt a compromising attitude towards those who suppress or resist criticism. In this regard, the person in charge of the Fushun Workers' Newspaper should also conduct a review.

### 坚决反对压制善意的批评

　　坚决反对压制善意的批评
    今天本刊发表的鲁渤和马克强二同志的来信以及前此发表的若干类似的来信，说明了某些地区某些单位某些领导同志还没有了解在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的重大意义，因而错误地用各种方法和借口来压制对本单位工作缺点的公开批评。压制公开批评的最普通的借口是说这种批评不合组织纪律，而这种借口的错误已由七月十八日本报信箱“共产党员向党报提出对政府工作的批评和建议是否合于组织纪律”解释得非常清楚了。压制公开批评的另一个借口是说批评“不合事实”或“不完全合乎事实”。如果批评者所批评的完全不合事实，那是不应该的；报纸如果发表了完全不合事实的批评稿件，报纸也要负责作公开的检讨与更正。但是现在所发生的并不是这样的事情。至于批评中如果有“不完全合乎事实”之处，只要它是善意的，被批评者也应以“有则改之，无则加勉”的态度来对待它，决不应采取粗暴的或置之不理的态度。中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”中说：“使得人民群众能够自由地在报纸刊物上发表他们对于党和人民政府的批评和建议，纵然这些批评和建议并非完全成熟与完全正确，而他们也不会因此受到打击与嘲笑，乃是提高人民群众的觉悟性和积极性，吸引人民群众踊跃参加国家建设事业的严重步骤。因此党的各级领导机关和干部必须对于反映群众意见的批评采取热烈欢迎和坚决保护的革命态度，而反对对群众批评置之不理、限制发表和对批评者实行打击、报复与嘲笑的官僚主义态度。”只有这样，才能激发群众批评的积极性，才能普遍深入地开展群众性的批评与自我批评。
    事实告诉我们：要普遍深入地开展公开的批评与自我批评，决不是轻而易举的事，必须对善意批评的抗拒者和压制者进行严重的斗争。为了完成这个任务，报纸必须负起应负的责任，发挥其应有的作用。报纸固然不应不负责任地发表违反原则的批评，但也决不应对压制或抗拒批评者采取迁就的态度。在这一点上，抚顺工人报的负责人也应该进行检讨。
