Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: While launching military aggression against Taiwan, American imperialists are intensifying their economic aggression against Taiwan. A group of American "economic experts" have arrived in Taiwan for activities. According to a Central News Agency (Kuomintang) dispatch from Taipei this month on the 13th, Nathan, the former director of the China program for the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, arrived in Taiwan on the 13th. Nathan's trip to Taiwan is an action by the United States to strengthen its economic control over Taiwan. As Deputy Director of the ECA Taiwan Branch, Nathan will implement his aid-the-bandit plan. Another dispatch from the bandit Central News Agency on the 6th stated that several American "economic experts" have arrived in Taiwan, including Jia Fujin, Grant Avery, and Ge Ling.

The U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration's aid to the Kuomintang remnant bandits has increased. According to Muir, Director of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration Taiwan Branch, the average monthly value of major supplies provided to Taiwan by the agency from January to the first half of this year was $2 million; since July, the monthly average has increased to over $3.5 million (Bandit Central News Agency Taipei, August 8th dispatch). As of the end of August this year, the U.S. ECA has provided a total of $183,279,000 in aid to the bandits (according to a report from the U.S. Information Service in Washington on August 30th, relayed by the Kuomintang Taipei Radio).

American imperialism is also using Japan to recklessly exploit Taiwan's material resources and dump Japan's surplus industrial goods on Taiwan. The trade agreement between Japan under MacArthur's rule and the Taiwan Kuomintang bandit gang was officially signed on the 6th of this month. According to a report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency, the so-called "Taiwan-Japan Trade Agreement" stipulates that the total trade volume of both parties is 50 million U.S. dollars each. The main finished products exported from Taiwan to Japan are salt, sugar, and wood pulp, including strategic materials. The main supplies exported from Japan to Taiwan are fertilizers, textiles, machine parts, and electrical equipment and other surplus Japanese industrial products.

　　美加紧对台经济侵略
    一批美“经济专家”抵台活动  并利用日本榨取台湾物质资源
    【新华社十五日讯】与展开对台湾的军事侵略活动同时，美帝国主义者正加紧对台湾的经济侵略。一批美国“经济专家”已到达台湾活动。据国民党中央社台北本月十三日电称：前任美国经济合作总署中国方案执行人纳森已于十三日抵台。纳森此次赴台，是美国加强对台湾经济控制的一个行动。纳森将以经合总署台湾分署副署长资格，执行其援匪方案。另据匪中央社六日电称：到达台湾的美国“经济专家”已有贾福金、葛兰特·艾维和葛陵等多人。
    美国经合总署供给国民党残匪的援助已有增加。据美国经合总署台湾分署署长穆懿尔透露：自今年一月起，上半年内，该署供应台湾的主要物资每月平均价值为二百万美元；自七月起，每月平均增至三百五十万美元以上（匪中央社台北八月八日电）。截至本年八月底止，美经合总署先后援匪款项已达一亿八千三百二十七万九千美元（据国民党台北电台转引美新闻处华盛顿八月三十日电）。
    美国帝国主义并利用日本放肆地榨取台湾的物质资源，并向台湾倾销日本的过剩工业品。麦克阿瑟统治下的日本与台湾国民党匪帮之间的贸易协定，已于本月六日正式签字。据国民党中央社报道，所谓“台日贸易协定”规定双方的贸易总额各为五千万美元。由台输日的主要成品为包括战略物资在内的盐、糖、木浆等。由日输台的主要物资为肥料、纺织品、机器零件和电力设备等项日本过剩的工业品。
