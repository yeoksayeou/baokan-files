The Dauntless and Unyielding Militia Hero, Zeng Shiyou

　　In a small mountain village in Guangdong, he led his militia, using inferior weapons, to resist an enemy with more than ten times the superior weaponry, then received the southward People's Liberation Army and liberated his hometown.

　　Comrade Zeng Shiyou is from Gaopo Village, Huangcha Township, Yangshan County, Guangdong Province. He is of peasant origin, 42 years old this year, and currently serves as the Deputy Head of the Second District People's Government of Yangshan County. In June of this year, he attended the First Guangdong Provincial Peasants' Representative Conference and was elected as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Peasants' Association. This time, he is a militia hero from the Guangdong Military Region attending the National Model Heroes Representative Conference.

　　Gaopo Village is located in high mountains, facing the Xiaobei River. The land is barren, with over sixty households, about five hundred people. For decades, they suffered from the exploitation of landlords, the harassment of bandits, and the oppression of reactionary governments. Everyone's situation deteriorated year by year, but the people were strong-willed and full of fighting spirit. More than ten years ago, Comrade Zeng learned boxing and practiced shooting, united the people of the entire village, organized armed resistance against bandits, and defended their homes. He fought bandits sixteen times. On two occasions, he defeated a large group of bandits of over five hundred people who wanted to pass through, and recovered a lot of grain, cattle, clothing, and other items stolen by bandits from neighboring villages. He gained the respect and love of the people in nearby villages, and the name of Zeng Shiyou began to spread throughout Huangcha Township.

　　Zeng Shiyou not only dared to fight bandits but also dared to resist the unreasonable oppression of the reactionary government. Once, the puppet township office came to Gaopo to conscript men, and he confiscated a handgun, and called on dozens of villagers to beat those guys until they shrank into the blockhouse for eleven days, afraid to come out.

　　In August 1948, our guerrilla team came to Gaopo Village. When he learned that it was the people's army, he actively helped the troops, raising grain, guiding the way, gathering intelligence, purchasing and transporting supplies, and mobilizing comfort activities. Under his leadership, the masses of the entire village united with the troops, and more than ninety militiamen were quickly organized, with him as the captain. The surrounding villages, through his promotion and influence, also gradually approached the troops and organized militias. From then on, Gaopo Village became the core of our guerrilla base.

　　Under the leadership of Comrade Zeng, the strong Gaopo villagers' militia, with the leadership of the Communist Party's guerrilla forces, improved their awareness, became more courageous and active, and never stopped standing guard and patrolling. They checked pedestrians and strictly guarded against enemy sneak attacks, and once discovered four enemy communication personnel. Once, two militiamen ambushed more than ten bandits, wounded two, and drove the bandits into the mountains, mobilizing all village militiamen to surround the bandits, demanding their surrender. However, the bandits wanted Comrade Zeng to go there in person, so Comrade Zeng decisively went up the mountain and brought the bandits down. He also rescued eight women who had been captured by the enemy.

　　In the early autumn of 1949, taking advantage of the opportunity when our main guerrilla force went north to meet the southward army, the enemy launched a large-scale mopping-up operation against our guerrilla base in Yangshan County, coercing the village militias to surrender, claiming that if they did not surrender, they would implement a "three-all policy" (kill all, burn all, loot all). Zeng Shiyou's Gaopo militia stood firm, unanimously believing: "Surrender is the most shameful thing, we would rather die than surrender." Seeing that coercion failed, the enemy changed its tactics and tried to lure Comrade Zeng, saying, "If you surrender, we will give you fifteen Browning pistols and invite you to be an official in the county government." But no trick could shake Comrade Zeng's strong will.

　　After the enemy's coercion and enticement failed, on July 19 (lunar calendar), they concentrated over a hundred troops and began to attack Gaopo Village. Our militiamen were already prepared. After half a day of fighting, they killed five enemies and won the initial victory, further strengthening their confidence.

　　At 10:00 a.m. on July 28, the enemy increased to more than 300 people, equipped with two small cannons and five light machine guns, and launched a large-scale attack on Gaopo Village from the east and west. The east road was the main attack, charging under the cover of intense artillery fire. After half a day of fierce fighting, the enemy's countless charges were repelled. By dusk, the enemy had suffered more than forty casualties and retreated to nearby villages and mountains. In this battle, only one militiaman was sacrificed.

　　On the evening of August 5, the enemy prepared four barrels of kerosene, concentrated more than 400 people, and tried to burn Gaopo Village. The enemy approached the edge of the village from the east. It was very dark, and the militiamen defending the village had not yet noticed it, until the enemy tied cotton to the tips of bamboo poles, smeared them with kerosene, and lit them to extend them to the eaves of the houses to burn the houses, then the militiamen noticed. With a gunshot, the militia's sharpshooter shot the bamboo pole in half. The fire burned on the ground, illuminating it like daylight. The militiamen could clearly see every enemy lurking in every corner of the village edge. From the east tower, from the large watchtower in the village, the militiamen in the houses all aimed accurately and fired. The enemies fell one by one, cries rising everywhere, making the enemy commander on the mountain shout, "Extinguish the fire!", "Don't use fire!" The enemies charged and were shot down one by one, stubbornly holding on for one night. When dawn was approaching, the enemy carried more than forty corpses and retreated to the mountains and nearby villages.

　　After the enemy suffered serious blows from three attacks, they could no longer organize an offensive, and could only live in nearby villages, occupying the high mountains to the south, and using artillery fire to block Gaopo Village. As soon as the door was opened during the day, the enemy's machine guns would fire, controlling the small river, making it impossible to fetch water to drink during the day. This was the enemy's dream of starving the people of Gaopo Village to death.

　　But the people of Gaopo Mountain could not be trapped. Under the leadership of Comrade Zeng Shiyou, they had full confidence and could actively strike at the enemy. If they couldn't fetch water from the river during the day, they would fetch it at night; if they ran out of firewood, they would dismantle the bamboo fences of the vegetable gardens at night; bullets and salt could also be smuggled in. Over time, the war tempered the people, and some people dared to work boldly during the day. When the tea seeds were ripe, they would post guards and go up the mountain to harvest them day and night, and all the tea seeds were brought back to the village. When the rice in the fields in front of the village was ripe, one night, they posted strict guards, mobilized the entire village to work, and harvested more than 7,000 catties of rice.

　　The enemy tried all means but still could not succeed, so they concentrated the forces of several counties, a total of 1,600 people, and on December 2, at 1:00 p.m., attacked from the east, west, and north. Mortars, 60mm cannons, and light and heavy machine guns fired densely. The militiamen calmly responded to the battle. When the enemy charged, they fired fiercely and drove them back. They would not fire unless the enemy came up, and the fierce battle continued until dusk, when the enemy stopped the attack. But they were tightly surrounded on three sides, and communication with the outside was also cut off.

　　On the 3rd, the enemy forced an old woman from a neighboring village to send a letter and a pass, asking them to surrender, and carried out a shouting campaign. Coercion and enticement did not shake the iron will of Zeng Shiyou and his militiamen. Comrade Zeng convened a cadre meeting, explaining: "The situation is favorable to us. The southward army is about to arrive. If we can persevere, we can win. We will never surrender!" Everyone enthusiastically supported Comrade Zeng Shiyou's proposal, unanimously stating: We will resolutely fight to the end, we will rather die than surrender, and we will make a name for ourselves in this battle. At the same time, they shouted to the enemy: "Those with cattle badges (Kuomintang soldiers) will not be killed if they surrender. The Communist Party treats prisoners leniently."

　　On the 4th, the enemy began a general attack, and the fiercest battles unfolded in all directions of the village. The number of enemy charges increased, and the enemy's artillery fire was very intense. The militiamen also roared, single-shot rifles, 7.9mm rifles, powder guns, and homemade cannons all fired, smashing the enemy's charge. The battle lasted for five days and five nights, and Zeng Shiyou and all the villagers had not rested.

　　The enemy's encirclement tightened day by day, communication with the outside was cut off, some enemies had already occupied the houses on the edge, completely controlling the small river, and the water source was cut off. Under the difficult circumstances of lack of ammunition and water, on October 7, he led all 500 men, women, and children in the entire village, under the cover of the militia, to safely evacuate to the south (towards the enemy's rear) via a detour. The next day after they evacuated, the enemy still dared not enter the village. It was not until the third day that they entered the Gaopo Village that had already been evacuated.

　　This time, the 96 militiamen of Gaopo Village, led by Zeng Shiyou, with four good 7.9mm rifles, and more than 90 leaky 7.9mm rifles, homemade single-shot rifles, and homemade cannons, resisted an enemy with more than ten times the superior weaponry, defended Gaopo Village for 108 days, killed more than 120 enemies, and wounded more than 40 enemies. Comrade Zeng alone killed 18 enemies.

　　After Comrade Zeng Shiyou evacuated his hometown and settled the old and young in the entire village, he led more than 40 militiamen north to Xingzi, near Hunan, to meet the southward army and liberate his hometown. After returning to the destroyed Gaopo Village, he immediately mobilized the entire village to build thatched huts and restore production. With the government's relief and assistance, and their efforts to produce and help themselves, Gaopo Village successfully completed the summer harvest and autumn planting.

　　Note: (1) There was a leap July in 1949 (lunar calendar), so the total is 108 days.
　　 (2) The above dates are all lunar calendar.

　　英勇不屈的民兵英雄曾石有
    在广东的一个小山村里，他领导着他的民兵队，以低劣的武器，抗击十多倍武器优良的敌人，然后接应南下解放军，解放了家乡。
    曾石有同志是广东省阳山县黄岔乡高坡村人，农民出身，今年四十二岁，现任阳山县第二区人民政府副区长。今年六月间曾出席广东省第一届农民代表会议，被选为广东省农民协会委员。这次又是广东军区出席全国英模代表会议的民兵英雄。
    高坡村是在高山丛中，前临小北江，土地贫瘠，有六十余户人家，约五百多人。几十年都是受着地主的剥削，土匪的骚扰，反动政府的压榨，大家的光景都一年不如一年，但民性强悍，富于斗争精神。曾同志早在十多年前就学打拳术与练习射击，团结了全村的人民，组织武装打击土匪，保卫家乡，先后与土匪打过十六次仗。有两次曾打败要借路经过的五百余人的大股土匪，夺回过很多邻村被土匪抢去的粮食、牛、衣物等东西，得到附近各村人民的尊敬与爱戴，于是曾石有的名字便开始在黄岔乡传开了。
    曾石有不但敢于打击土匪，并敢于反抗反动政府的无理欺压。一次伪乡公所到高坡要壮丁，被他缴了一支手枪，并号召几十个村民把那班家伙打得缩到炮楼里十一天不敢出来。
    一九四八年八月，我游击队活动到了高坡村，他知道这是人民的队伍，就积极帮助部队，筹粮、带路、探情报、购运物资、发动慰劳，忙个不了。在他的带领下，全村的群众与部队结合在一起了，并很快组织了九十多个民兵，他当了队长。周围的村庄经过他的推动与影响，也都陆续靠近了部队，组织了民兵。从此，高坡村就成了我们游击根据地的核心了。
    在曾同志带领下的强悍的高坡村民兵，有了共产党游击部队的领导，觉悟提高了，更英勇积极了，站岗放哨从未停过，盘查行人，严防敌人的偷袭，曾盘查出四名敌人的通讯人员。一次，两个民兵伏击土匪十余人，打伤了两名，并把土匪赶到山上，动员各村民兵将土匪包围起来，要他们缴枪投降。但是土匪要曾同志亲自前去，曾同志就果断地上山把土匪带下来。并曾救出被敌人抓去的八个妇女。
    一九四九年秋初，敌人乘我游击队主力北上接应大军南下的时机，向我阳山县的游击根据地大举扫荡，威迫各村民兵投降，声言不投降就实行“三光政策”。曾石有的高坡民兵屹立不动，一致认为：“投降是最耻辱的，打死也不投降。”敌人见威迫不成，于是就改变花样，利诱曾同志，说：“如投降就给他十五条驳壳枪，请他到县政府做官。”但任何花样都动摇不了曾同志的坚强意志。
    敌人威迫利诱失败后，于七月十九日（旧历）集中百余兵力开始进攻高坡村。我们的民兵早就准备好了，经过半天的战斗，打死了敌人五名，赢得了初次的胜利，更增强了他们的信心。
    七月二十八日上午十时，敌人增至三百余人，配两门小炮，五挺轻机枪，分东西两路向高坡村大举进攻。以东路为主攻，在猛烈的炮火掩护下冲锋。经过半天的猛烈战斗，敌人无数次的冲锋，都被打退了。黄昏时，敌人伤亡了四十余人，退回附近村庄及山上。这次战斗中民兵只牺牲一名。
    八月初五晚，敌人准备了四桶洋油，集中四百余人，想火烧高坡村。敌人从东面摸到村沿，天黑得很，在村中坚守的民兵还未发觉，直至敌人用棉花扎在竹竿尖上粘了洋油点起火来伸到屋檐烧屋了，民兵才发觉。一声枪响，民兵的神枪手一枪就将竹竿打断了，火在地上烧着，照得如同白昼，伏在村沿每个角落的敌人都被民兵看得清清楚楚。东楼上，村中的大碉楼上，房子内的民兵都瞄得准准的射击，敌人一个个的倒下了，哀声四起，急得在山上的敌人指挥官高叫“熄火”，“不要火了”。敌人冲来便一个个打倒下去，顽强的坚守了一个夜晚。天将亮时，敌人背着四十多具死尸退到山上及附近庄子去了。
    敌人三次进攻受到严重的打击后，再不能组织进攻了，只有住在附近村庄，占领南面高山，用炮火封锁高坡村。白天一开门，敌人的机枪就打过来，控制了小河，白天挑不上水吃。这是敌人梦想要困死高坡村的人民。
    但高山坡的人民是困不倒的，他们在曾石有同志的领导下，有着充分的信心，并能主动的打击敌人。白天不能去河里挑水，晚上去挑；柴没了晚上去拆菜园的竹篱，子弹与盐也可偷运过来。日子久了，战争锻炼了人民，白天也有些人大胆地工作了。茶籽熟了，就放出警戒，白天黑夜的上山收摘，茶籽全部收回村来。村前的田禾熟了，一个晚上，放出严密的警戒，动员全村动手，抢收了七千余斤谷子。
    敌人用尽办法，仍不得计，乃不顾一切的集中了几个县的兵力一千六百余人，于十二月二日下午一时，从东、西、北三面进攻。迫击炮，六○小炮，轻重机枪密密的打来。民兵们沉着应战，敌人冲来了便猛烈射击，把他们打回去，敌人不上来他们不放枪，激战至黄昏，敌人停止了进攻。但三面被紧紧的包围着，对外的联络也给切断了。
    初三日，敌人迫着邻村的老太婆送来信与通行证，要他们投降，并进行喊话。威迫利诱，都没有动摇曾石有和他的民兵们的铁的意志。曾同志召集干部会议，说明：“形势对我们有利，南下大军即要到来，能坚持就能胜利，绝不投降！”大家热烈地支持曾石有的主张，一致表示：坚决打到底，打死也不投降，并要求在这次战斗中打出个名堂来。同时也对敌人进行喊话：“牛骨（匪军）投降不杀，共产党优待俘虏。”
    初四日，敌人开始总攻，最激烈的战斗在村子各方面展开。敌人一次次冲锋的人数增多了，敌人的炮火打得很厉害。民兵们也怒吼了，单响，七九，粉枪，土炮，全都响起来，打垮了敌人的冲锋。战斗坚持了五天五夜，曾石有与全村人民一直没休息。
    敌人的包围一天天的紧缩了，与外面的联系断了，有些敌人已进占到边沿的房子，完全控制了小河，水源断了。在弹缺水缺的困难情况下，他便在十月七日带领全村男女老少全部五百余人由民兵掩护向南（敌人后方的方向）绕道安全的撤退出来。他们撤离后的第二天，敌人仍不敢进村，直到第三天，才进入了已经撤空了的高坡村。
    这次，曾石有领导下的高坡村民兵九十六人，以四支好的七九步枪，及九十余支漏底七九、土造单响、土炮等劣势武器，抗击十多倍武器优良的敌人，坚守高坡村一百零八天，共击毙敌人一百二十余人，杀伤敌人四十余人，只曾同志个人就击毙敌人十八名。
    曾石有同志撤离家乡，安置全村老幼后，即带领四十余个民兵北上至接近湖南的星子接应南下大军，解放家乡。回到被敌破坏的高坡村后，即发动全村盖茅舍，进行恢复生产，在政府的救济帮助下，在他们努力生产自救下，高坡村胜利的完成了夏收秋种。
    注：（一）一九四九年旧历有闰七月，故合计是一百零八天。
        （二）以上日期都是旧历。
