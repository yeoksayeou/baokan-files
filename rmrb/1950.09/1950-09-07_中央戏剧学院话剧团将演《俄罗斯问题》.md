　　Central Academy of Drama Theater Troupe to Perform "The Russian Question"
    To expand the propaganda of the peace preservation movement and thoroughly expose the essence of the reactionary rule of the United States, the Central Academy of Drama Theater Troupe will stage the famous Soviet play "The Russian Question" this month. The play was originally written by the famous writer K. Simonov, translated by Mao Dun, and won the Stalin Literary Award in 1946.
    The play sharply exposes the false mask of American so-called "democracy and freedom" through the unfortunate experience of an honest American journalist, and the despicable conspiracy of imperialism to deliberately provoke war. It also illustrates how the long-oppressed progressive people of the United States are longing for true democracy and freedom, and yearning for the great peace and democracy fortress – the Soviet Union.
    The Central Academy of Drama Theater Troupe is carefully preparing for this performance, directed by Professor Zhang Min, designed by Professor Liu Lu, and rehearsed by the main members of the troupe, to improve the quality of the performance to express the profound ideological content of the script.

　　中央戏剧学院话剧团将演《俄罗斯问题》
    中央戏剧学院话剧团为扩大保卫和平运动的宣传，彻底揭露美国反动统治的本质，将于本月中上演苏联名剧《俄罗斯问题》。该剧为名作家Ｋ·西蒙诺夫原著，茅盾翻译，曾于一九四六年荣获斯大林文艺奖。
    剧本通过一个诚实的美国记者的不幸遭遇，尖锐地揭破了美国所谓“民主与自由”的假面具，和帝国主义居心挑拨战争的卑鄙阴谋，并且说明了久受压榨的美国进步人民是如何地渴望着真正的民主与自由，和向往着伟大的和平民主堡垒——苏联。
    中央戏剧学院话剧团慎重地准备这次演出，由章泯教授导演，刘露教授设计，集中该团主力排演，提高演出质量以表达剧本深刻的思想内容。
