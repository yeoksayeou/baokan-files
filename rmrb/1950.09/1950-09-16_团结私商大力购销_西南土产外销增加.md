Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 11th: State-owned trading companies in Southwest China have, in the past six months, united with private merchants to organize the export of local products, which has led to a marked improvement in the production and sales of major native products in the region.

Prior to the liberation of the Southwest, the plunder and sabotage by the Kuomintang remnants had brought the production and sales of local products to a standstill. Tung oil and gallnuts in eastern Sichuan and Guizhou were left to rot in the fields, while the production of medicinal herbs and tea in western Sichuan decreased by more than 80% last year. The production of silk, sugar, and bristles also declined sharply. After the liberation of the Southwest, state-owned trading companies were established one after another and immediately began to support the export of native products. However, before May of this year, due to bandit harassment and the disruption of urban-rural relations, it was not possible to purchase native products smoothly. After May, with the victory of the suppression of bandits and the restoration of transportation, the isolation between urban and rural areas gradually improved, and the purchase work was carried out on a large scale. In total, state-owned trading companies in Southwest China invested more than 400 billion RMB in the purchase of native products in the past six months. The state-owned Oil, Native Produce, and Bristle Companies, as well as the joint state-private "Sichuan Silk Company," purchased 5,076 metric tons of tung oil, 13,773 dan (1 dan = 121 jin) of pig bristles, 3,200 dan of raw silk, 5,708 dan of medicinal herbs, and other fur and tea.

In order to organize the export of native products, state-owned trading companies solved the difficulties of shipping and trucking. As a result, the volume of exports of native products increased significantly after May. According to incomplete statistics from Chongqing, the export of tung oil in July increased by 197.8% compared to June, pig bristles increased by 3%, and cowhide increased by 40%. The state-owned trading company in southern Sichuan increased the purchase and export of tung oil in June by two times compared to May, and the transportation and sales of ramie and homespun cloth increased by 25 times. The total value of native products exported from Guizhou Province in June increased more than three times compared to May. The output of native products in Yunnan Province in June exceeded 60% of May.

With the improvement of the purchase and sales of native products, the rural market has become increasingly active. For example, the transaction volume of medicinal materials in Songpan and Guanxian areas of western Sichuan in June and July exceeded the total from January to May of this year. The prices of native products have also gradually risen. Due to the timely purchase of jute by the Sichuan East Trading Company, the price in July increased by two times compared to March, approaching the normal price. The scope of RMB circulation in rural areas has also expanded as a result. For example, in western Yunnan and the border areas of Sichuan and Guizhou, the RMB has gradually circulated due to the purchase of tung oil and other products by state-owned trading companies. Industrial products have also begun to flow steadily into the countryside. The total value of industrial products supplied to rural areas in Yunnan Province in June reached 29.6 billion RMB. The production of native products in various places, which was severely devastated by the Kuomintang remnants, is gradually recovering. For example, tea, the most important specialty of Xikang Province, is gradually recovering.

State-owned trading companies in various parts of Southwest China have adopted the method of entrusting private merchants to purchase and process native products. Banks have also provided a large number of loans to support them. The Chongqing Branch of the Bank of China handled export mortgage loans of 7.9 billion RMB for private exporters of native products from April to July. Due to the profitability of purchasing native products, the number of private merchants engaged in the business has gradually increased. For example, the number of private pig bristle factories in Chengdu increased from six to nineteen, and in Luxian from eight to fifty-one.

The main shortcomings of the state-owned trading companies in various parts of Southwest China in supporting the production and sales of native products are: first, in some areas, the state-owned trading companies did not dare to boldly and promptly carry out purchases when prices fell, which caused some losses to the interests of farmers. For example, in the Neijiang area of southern Sichuan, after sugar prices stabilized in March of this year, the state-owned trading companies did not dare to purchase freely, which led to a general decline in sugar prices below cost, causing losses to sugarcane farmers. Second, at present, the state-owned trading companies are still only purchasing native products that can be exported, and have not paid attention to the products sold in Southwest China, such as rapeseed oil and tobacco leaves in Guizhou Province, which are still in a state of sluggish sales. Third, there is a shortcoming of not paying attention to quality in the purchase of native products. For example, when purchasing tung oil, the state-owned Oil Company in eastern Sichuan did not pay attention to the color of the tung oil, so that some peddlers even mixed wood oil, rice soup, sesame oil, and other things into the tung oil. These shortcomings have now begun to be corrected, and the Trade Department of the Southwest Military and Political Committee has submitted a request to the Trade Department of the Central People's Government for an allocation of 50 billion RMB as a fund to support the sale of domestic native products and develop local trade in the future.

### 团结私商大力购销  西南土产外销增加

　　团结私商大力购销
    西南土产外销增加
    【新华社重庆十一日电】西南各地国营贸易公司半年来团结私商，组织土产外销，已使西南各地主要土产品的产销情况开始好转。
    在西南全区解放以前，由于国民党残余匪帮的掠夺破坏，土产品的产销曾经陷于停顿状态。川东、贵州一带的桐子、五棓子货弃于地，川西的药材、茶叶去年减产竟达百分之八十以上，丝、糖、猪鬃等生产也都一蹶不振。西南解放以后，各地国营贸易公司相继建立，立即开始扶助土产外销；但在今年五月以前，由于土匪骚扰，城乡关系阻塞，还不能顺利地收购土产。五月以后，随着剿匪胜利，交通恢复，城乡隔绝的情况逐步好转，收购工作即大规模地开展起来。总计半年来西南各地国营贸易公司投入于收购土产的资金共达人民币四千多亿元。经国营油脂、土产、猪鬃等三个专业公司和公私合营的“四川丝业公司”收购的土产品，计有桐油五千零七十六公吨，猪鬃一万三千七百七十三关担（每关担合一百二十一市斤），生丝三千二百关担，药材五千七百零八担，以及其他毛皮、茶叶等。
    为着组织土产外销，国营贸易公司解决了轮船和汽车运输的困难，因此在五月份以后，土产输出量有了显著增加。据重庆市的不完整统计：七月份输出桐油较六月份增加百分之一百九十七点八，猪鬃增加百分之三，牛皮增加百分之四十。川南国营贸易公司六月份收购和外运的桐油均较五月份增加两倍，夏布、土布的运销增加二十五倍。贵州全省六月份土产外运总值比五月份增加三倍以上。云南省六月份土产输出超过五月份的百分之六十。
    随着土产购销情况的好转，农村市场已日趋活跃。如川西松潘、灌县一带六、七两月药材成交量即超过今年一月至五月的总和。土产价格亦逐步上升。川东的大青麻，由于川东贸易公司及时收购，七月份价格比三月份增加两倍，已接近正常价格。人民币在农村中的流通范围也已因此扩展，如在滇西和川黔边境，因国营贸易公司收购桐油和其他产品，人民币已逐渐流通。工业品也开始源源下乡。云南省六月份供应农村需要的工业品总值达二百九十六亿元。曾被国民党残匪严重摧残的各地土产生产事业，开始逐渐恢复。如西康省最重要的特产——茶叶即在逐步恢复中。
    西南各地国营贸易公司在收购土产中都采用了委托私商代购和加工的方式。银行方面也发放了大量贷款予以扶助。中国银行重庆分行四月至七月曾办理私营出口商土产出口押汇贷款七十九亿元。由于收购土产有利，经营土产的私商逐渐增多。如成都私营猪鬃厂由六家增至十九家，泸县由八家增至五十一家。
    西南各地国营贸易公司在扶植土产品产销工作中的主要缺点是：第一，某些地区的国营贸易公司在物价下跌时，不敢大胆地及时地进行收购，因而使农民利益遭受了某些损失。如川南内江专区的蔗糖，在今年三月间物价平稳以后，因国营贸易公司未敢放手收购，以致糖价普遍下落到成本以下，蔗农因而受到损失。其次，目前各国营贸易公司所收购的仍只限于能够出口的土产，对于西南内销产品仍未注意，如贵州省的菜油、烟叶尚陷于滞销状态。再次，在收购土产中有不重品质的缺点。如川东区国营油脂公司在收购桐油时，未注意桐油成色，以致有部分贩运商竟将木油、米汤、麻油等渗入桐油。这些缺点目前已开始纠正，西南军政委员会贸易部并已呈准中央人民政府贸易部，拨出人民币五百亿元，作为今后扶植内销土产，开展地方贸易的资金。
