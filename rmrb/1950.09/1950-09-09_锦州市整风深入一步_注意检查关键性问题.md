　　Jinzhou's Rectification Deepens
    Attention to Key Issues
    [Our Newspaper] The rectification campaign in Jinzhou City, Liaoxi Province, has entered the inspection phase in various units. Most of these units have been able to focus on key issues, resulting in more in-depth inspections that have uncovered a greater number of significant problems. However, a few units have experienced deviations due to a lack of understanding of the rectification policy by leading cadres.

    In Jinzhou's enterprises, the focus is mainly on checking economic accounting. Due to the lack of thorough planning among factory leaders, a lack of clear understanding, or due to procrastination and lax systems, funds are tied up, raw materials are wasted, and capital turnover is seriously affected. The Jinzhou Paper Mill has several hundred million yuan in working capital, about half of which is tied up in raw materials and more than half in finished products that cannot be sold temporarily. As a result, 100% of the working capital is frozen, and the factory relies on bank loans to maintain operations. Waste of raw materials is also a serious issue. The Machinery Factory even melted a washing machine body and band saw, worth over 100 million yuan, as scrap iron. Other units also have serious waste issues. There are also many problems with leadership style. For example, the Construction Company, in pursuit of profit, has engaged in private networking and using public office for private gain, such as giving gifts to personnel at the West Machinery Factory, treating them to shows and restaurants, and spending over 30 million yuan in public funds. In addition, some units have found that their business policies are unclear and their work is not playing its due role. For example, the Trust Company, which should be serving industry by promoting industrial products and purchasing raw materials, has mainly been dealing in grain. In the government sector, the Tax Bureau has identified a tendency to emphasize tasks while neglecting policies.

    Due to in-depth inspection of work, cadres are gradually recognizing the errors and shortcomings in their work and style, and their harmfulness to the work and the people. And there have been some improvements in work, and work efficiency has begun to improve. For example, the director of the technical office of the Construction Company took the initiative to convene a meeting of technicians to study and improve technology. The director of the Fur Factory actively led everyone to clean the warehouse and improve the system for receiving raw materials. The Trust Company has drafted proposals for improving business policies and various systems, and began implementing them on August 15.

    Some deviations have also occurred in the rectification process, mainly reflected in the fact that some units are still unable to integrate the study of documents with the inspection of work; or, in the inspection work, they are still unable to proceed according to the established policies. For example, the Grain Company is still inspecting individuals instead of work, the Wood Company has turned the inspection of work into a general review meeting, and the Kaiming Company has formulated an "Inspection Outline" that restricts everyone from making suggestions. The Jinzhou Paper Mill issued several broad topics during the mobilization report, making everyone feel that it was "like a tiger eating the sky, with nowhere to start" and that it was difficult to make suggestions.

    At present, the problems have generally been identified in various units, but they need to be analyzed and studied in depth to find the causes of the problems as a basis for improving work, so that the movement can continue to move forward.

### 锦州市整风深入一步  注意检查关键性问题

　　锦州市整风深入一步
    注意检查关键性问题
    【本报讯】辽西省锦州市各单位的整风已进入检查工作阶段。其中大多数单位能够注意检查关键性的问题，因此检查也比较深入，发现问题较多也较重要。但也有少数单位，因为领导干部对整风方针掌握不够，就发生了一些偏差。
    锦州市在企业单位中，主要是检查经济核算问题，由于各厂领导上缺乏周密计划，心中无数，或因作风拖拉、制度松懈，以致积压资金，浪费原料，严重地影响了资金周转。锦州造纸厂共有若干亿流动资金，其中约有一半积压在原料上，有一半多积压在一时无法销售的成品上，流动资金因此百分之百被冻结了。结果靠银行贷款来维持营业。浪费原料的现象也很严重，机械厂将价值一亿多元的洗床身子和带锯，竟当废铁熔化了。其他各单位也有严重浪费的现象。领导作风上也存在不少问题，例如建设公司为了追求利润，竟发生私人拉拢，假公济私等现象，给西机厂人员送礼物，请人看戏下馆子，动支公用费三千万元以上。此外，有些单位检查出业务方针不明确，工作未起到应有的作用，例如信托公司，本应为工业服务，推销工业产品与收购原料，但该公司主要经营了粮食。在机关方面：税务局检查出重任务轻政策的观点等。
    由于深入检查了工作，使干部逐渐认识到工作与作风中的错误与缺点，及其对工作对人民的危害性。并且在工作上已有某些改进，工作效率开始提高。如建设公司技术室主任，主动的召集技术人员会议，研究改进技术。皮毛厂业主任积极领导大家清理仓房，改进领取原材料制度，信托公司在改进业务方针与各种制度上已拟出草案，并已于八月十五日开始实施。
    在整风过程中，也发生了一些偏向，主要表现在某些单位学习文件还不能结合检查工作；或者检查工作中，还不能按照既定的方针进行。如粮食公司还是检查个人，不检查工作，木器公司把检查工作变成了一般的检讨会，开明公司制定了“检查提纲”，限制了大家提意见，锦州造纸厂在动员报告时，出了几个大题，使大家感到“老虎吃天，无处下口”不好提意见。
    目前各单位一般的都把问题检查出来了，但须进行深刻的分析研究，找出问题产生的原因，作为改进工作的依据，使运动继续向前深入一步。
