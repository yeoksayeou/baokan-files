"Please accept my sincere respect!"
    A letter from Cai Zhiping, a family member of a revolutionary martyr, to Chairman Mao

    Dear Chairman Mao:

    I am Cai Zhiping, the son of Cai Xiemin from Huarong County, Hunan Province. My father graduated from the Peasant Movement Training Institute you established in Guangdong in 1925. From beginning to end, he was consistently and wholeheartedly dedicated to the people's revolutionary cause. This past April, Minister He of the Ministry of Heavy Industry wrote to inform me: "Your father served as a political commissar of a certain regiment in Jinggang Mountain, later transferred to be the Director of the Organization Department of a certain division, and was finally sent to Fujian to carry out underground work. Unfortunately, he was killed in 1934, sacrificing himself for the people!" Chairman Mao, you must still remember that glorious revolutionary history of my father.

    Chairman Mao, the reactionary faction's methods of treating the families of revolutionaries are so cruel! The shocking massacre of General He Changgong's entire family throughout Hunan Province is evidence of the reactionary faction's crimes against revolutionary families at that time. Although my family evaded for a while, we still suffered relentless persecution. Our houses and land were confiscated, and our entire family, young and old, were wanted with rewards on our heads. As a result, my mother was finally arrested and suffered severe torture. At that time, I was very young and could only spend those series of tragic days crying!

    In 1943, the Kuomintang reactionaries even began to monitor me again, making me taste bitterness! However, under the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, I always maintained my identity as a descendant of revolutionaries, waged a resolute struggle against the enemy, and waited for the coming of bright days.

    After Huarong County was liberated last year, Comrade He Guanghua, sent by Minister He, found me and introduced me to work in the government. This year, Minister Zeng Zhi of the Ministry of Heavy Industry of the Central and South Military and Political Committee introduced me to study at the Central Plains University Political Institute. After graduating, the organization assigned me to work at the Xiangtan Electric Factory.

    Chairman Mao, I, a child who suffered humiliation and discrimination under the bloody rule of the reactionary faction, am now liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by you! Moreover, I graduated from the people's own university and am working in the people's own factory. I feel honored and delighted! Before, every time I thought about the tragic days of the past, I felt infinite sorrow in my heart and couldn't help but shed tears! But I will never do that now. I will turn my tears into strength, inherit my father's legacy, wholeheartedly serve the people, and avenge my father and countless uncles and granduncles who were killed by the reactionary faction just like my father!

    Dear Chairman Mao, I now clearly realize that only under your leadership and the leadership of the Communist Party can the people stand up and live a happy and joyful life. I am willing to follow you forever. Please accept my sincere respect! I wish you good health!

         Cai Zhiping, family member of a revolutionary martyr
            August 29th, at Xiangtan Electric Factory

### “请你接受我诚挚的敬意吧！”  烈属蔡至平给毛主席的信

　　“请你接受我诚挚的敬意吧！”
    烈属蔡至平给毛主席的信亲爱的毛主席：
    我是湖南省华容县蔡协民的儿子。我的父亲于一九二五年在广东你所办的农民讲习所毕业后，自始至终，一贯忠心耿耿为人民革命事业而奋斗。今年四月间，据重工业部何部长写信告诉我：“你父亲在井岗山任××团政治委员，后来调任×师组织部长，最后派赴福建担任地下工作，不幸于一九三四年遇害，为人民牺牲了！”毛主席，我父亲的那一段光荣的革命史实，你一定还记得的。
    毛主席，反动派对待革命家属的手段是多么残酷啊！轰动湖南全省的屠杀何长工将军全家的血案，就是反动派当时对待革命家属的罪证。我家里的人虽然躲避了一下，但仍然遭到了无情的迫害，房屋田产被没收了，我们全家老小都被悬赏缉拿。结果，我母亲终于被捕，受尽了严刑拷打。那时候，我年纪还很小，只能用哭来打发这一连串悲惨的日子！
    一九四三年，国民党反动派竟然又对我开始监视起来，使我尝尽苦楚！但是，我在蒋匪帮的淫威之下，始终保持了革命后代的身份，与敌人作坚决的斗争，等待着光明时日的来临。
    去年华容县解放后，何部长派何光化同志找到了我，并介绍我参加政府工作。今年，中南军政委员会重工业部曾志部长，介绍我进入中原大学政治学院学习，毕业后，组织上派我到湘潭电工厂工作。
    毛主席，我这个在反动派的血腥统治下受尽侮蔑和歧视的孩子，如今在以你为首的共产党领导之下，得到了解放！而且在人民自己的大学里毕了业，又在人民自己的工厂里做着工作。我感到了荣幸和欢欣！以前，我每一回想到过去悲惨日子的时候，内心就感到无限的沉痛，情不自禁的淌下眼泪来！但是，我现在决不会这样了，我要把我的泪水变成力量，继承父亲的遗志，全心全意为人民服务，为我父亲和无数的和我父亲同样惨遭反动派杀害的伯伯叔叔们复仇！
    亲爱的毛主席，我现在已经明确的认识到，只有在你和共产党的领导下，人民才能翻身，才能过着愉快幸福的日子。我愿意永远跟着你走，请你接受我诚挚的敬意吧！祝你健康！
          烈属蔡至平
            八月二十九日于湘潭电工厂
