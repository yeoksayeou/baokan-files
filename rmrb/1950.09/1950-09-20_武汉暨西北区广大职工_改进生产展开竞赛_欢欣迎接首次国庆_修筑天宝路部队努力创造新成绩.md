Xinhua News Agency, September 19th: Broad workers in Wuhan in the Central South region and the Northwest region are enthusiastically launching a production competition to greet National Day with new labor achievements. In mid-July, the Wuhan Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to "launch a production competition to greet National Day." The competition was launched in several factories in August. Among them, the workers of the farm tool manufacturing plant of the Hubei Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Department actively assisted the administration in the competition and initially established several quota managements such as fixed time, fixed quantity, fixed material, and fixed quality. In August, the average plant overfulfilled the production plan by 10%. The workers of the automobile repair plant of the Logistics Department of the Fourth Field Army clearly stipulated that reducing the scrap rate should be the main competition goal in this competition. After the efforts of all the workers to study and improve technology, the scrap rate of the 150 rate circle in August was reduced to 6.5%; the scrap rate of the 150 gas top rose to 9.5%, which has overfulfilled the competition goal for two months. In terms of output, the whole factory also overfulfilled the production plan by more than 10% on average. The competition of the Jiji Hydropower Plant and the E'nan Wuchang Power Plant is mainly aimed at reducing coal consumption. In August, the coal consumption rate of the E'nan Power Plant was reduced by 5.4% compared with July. The power generation increased by 2.7% compared with the planned plan. There were no accidents throughout the month. The coal consumption rate of the Jiji Hydropower Plant was reduced by 0.6%. Workers in other enterprises, such as the automobile repair plant of the Central South Transportation Company, the Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau, and the privately-owned Zhongxin and the joint state-private Zhenhuan Textile Factories, have also achieved remarkable results in the production competition.

The competition movement in Xi'an, Ningxia, Gansu and other places in the Northwest region has also been launched. All the workers of the Xinhua Paper Mill in Yinchuan City, Ningxia Province, first proposed a one-month red flag competition, and formulated a specific plan to ensure that the quality and quantity of products are improved and raw materials are saved in the competition, and challenged other factories. Other factories involved in the competition include machinery, fur, and leather factories. The Northwest Automobile Repair Factory in Gansu Province is now collecting waste materials, preparing to revive 48 broken and abandoned automobiles that have been parked for more than three years. All the workers of the Chang'an Electric Section General Repair Room of the Xi'an Railway Sub-bureau launched a production movement on September 5.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 19th: The People's Liberation Army troops building the Baoji-Tianshui section of the Longhai Railway have overcome all kinds of difficulties and worked actively. In the past four months, they have completed 44% of the total earth and stone works, totaling more than 3.6 million cubic meters of earth and stone. Under the slogan of "Labor plus technology, overcoming nature," the commanders and fighters of the road construction troops have created many new tools and methods, which greatly improved work efficiency. In order to welcome the first National Day of New China, the political department of the road construction troops specially called on the entire army to launch a movement to create new achievements on the production and learning front.

In order to comfort the road construction troops and understand the project situation, all sectors of Xi'an City organized a comfort group, led by Vice Mayor Zhang Fengbo, carrying movies, books, medicines, banners and other comfort items, and arrived at the site along the line to express condolences and visit the heroic models that emerged during road construction. From August 16 to September 10, in more than 20 days, the group visited 13 units and showed more than 40 films. The visit of the delegation further encouraged the road construction mood of the troops. One company, in order to ensure the opening of traffic and rush to repair landslides, worked continuously in the mud for three days and nights.

    西北区的西安、宁夏、甘肃等地竞赛运动亦已展开，宁夏省银川市新华造纸厂全体职工首先提出一个月为期的红旗竞赛，订出具体计划，保证在竞赛中提高产品质量，数量和节省原料，并向其他工厂提出挑战。其他卷入竞赛的有机器、皮毛、制革等工厂。甘肃省西北汽车修理厂现正收集废旧器材，准备把停放三年以上的四十八辆破废汽车复活起来。西安铁路分局长安电务段总修理房全体职工于九月五日展开了生产运动。

    为了慰问修路部队及了解工程情况，西安市各界曾组织慰问团，由张锋伯副市长率领，携带电影、书籍、药品、锦旗等慰问品抵达沿线现场慰问并访问修路中出现的英雄模范。从八月十六日到九月十日的二十余天中，该团先后慰问了十三个单位，放映电影四十余场。慰问团此行，更鼓舞了部队的修路情绪。有一个连队为了保证通车，抢修塌方，竟在泥浆里连续工作三昼夜。
