　　The Grassland Horse Herding Expert, Ha Yin Jin
    Bai Lan
    Ha Yin Jin, one of the representatives attending the National Congress of Labor Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, is a simple grassland herdsman who is already sixty years old this year. He was born into a poor herding family in the Fifth Zuo of the Western United Banner (formerly the Fourth Zuo of the West Abaga Banner) in the Xilin Gol League of Inner Mongolia. He began herding horses for pasture owners at the age of thirteen, and accumulated extremely rich herding experience over his long years of hard work. He is not only a skilled herdsman, but also a capable hunter. He has superhuman eyesight; he can see far into the distance, and he can track and hunt foxes. Moreover, he shoots accurately, hitting his target every time. He pays close attention to the nutrition and health of the horses, and he always follows the herds tirelessly, finding them fresh water and grass. From spring to autumn, he tries his best to find places with "Agen" and "Tacao" (white artemisia and wild onion). In this way, he can make the horses fat and strong for the winter. In winter, he grazes them on the plains. He leads the horse, follows the horse, slowly letting the horse eat grass, so as not to let the snow grass be trampled by the horse's hooves, and the horse cannot eat the grass. In autumn, he waters the horses at noon, so that the horses do not eat grass well at night if they drink too early - "a horse cannot be fat without night grass." In summer, he waters the horses in the morning and evening, because if the horse drinks at noon, the horse does not like to come out of the water, and it is easy to get hoof disease. Drinking water in the morning can also avoid sweat disease. When he talked about herding experience, he said: "It is necessary to change water and grass in all seasons, follow the grass, and do not let the horses run fast when grazing, and do not call the horses together. You should follow the herd day and night to ensure that the horse does not suffer any losses." Under Ha Yin Jin's care, the horses have never been bitten by a wolf. These herding skills and experience are indeed not easy for ordinary herdsmen to achieve, which is one of the reasons why Ha Yin Jin became a labor model.
    When he was thirty years old, he herded horses for a pasture owner. Originally, there were only four hundred horses, but after four years of careful herding, the herd increased to one thousand. One year, one hundred and fifty foals were born, and at the same time, none died. But how did the pasture owner treat him? Ha Yin Jin was very sad when he recalled this matter. Although Ha Yin Jin worked hard day and night, in all kinds of weather for the pasture owner, not to mention that he could not eat rice and noodles, even in winter he only ate the head, hooves and offal (such as sheep intestines). When Ha Yin Jin could no longer bear it and decided to leave the pasture owner, the pasture owner only gave him a horse, and it was a "reward."
    However, the Communist Party has brought happiness to the herdsmen. Under the policies of the Party and the People's Government to develop the pastoral economy, Ha Yin Jin now has eight horses, five cows, three sheep, a Mongolian yurt, and an ox cart, and has married a wife.
    In 1948, he was selected as a labor model of the league for his contribution to breeding forty horses. Among them were nineteen horses that were not of breeding age, but he carefully grouped and mated them, and also bred six horses. At the same time, he also killed fourteen wolves of all sizes, reducing the harm to livestock.
    In May of this year, the Xilin Gol League suffered a snow disaster. Due to careful management, Ha Yin Jin's herd of horses suffered minimal losses. He fought against the cold in the blizzard for a day and two nights. In order not to freeze the horses to death, he sometimes drove the horses to run, and sometimes let the horses stand there and eat grass. He drove the horses back and forth, exercising, and his whole body became hot, and he finally overcame the snow disaster. In the blizzard, everyone thought that the old man (referring to Ha Yin Jin) had frozen to death, and the horses were gone. But when he overcame the disaster and appeared in front of everyone with the horses, everyone welcomed him, loved him, and comforted him so warmly.
    Being selected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers was something Ha Yin Jin could not have imagined. He felt that he was a herdsman in the Mongolian grasslands, and he had never participated in such a grand event. He was afraid that he would not be able to speak; he asked someone to write down his herding situation and report it to Chairman Mao.

　　草原牧马能手哈音金
    白岚
    出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议代表之一的哈音金，是个纯朴的草原牧人，今年已经六十岁了。他出生在内蒙锡林郭勒盟西部联合旗第五佐（原西阿巴哈那尔旗第四佐）一家贫穷的牧人家里。从十三岁起就给牧主放马，他在长期辛勤的放牧岁月中，积累了极丰富的放牧经验。他不但是一个放牧的能手，而且也是一个精悍的猎手。他有超人的目力，他能看见的远处，他能跟着足迹猎获狐狸。并且射击准确，百发百中。他非常注意马的营养和疾病，他总是不怕劳苦地追随着马群，给它们找到清鲜的水草。从春天到秋天，他尽力地去找有“阿根”和“塔草”（白蒿草和野葱）的地方。这样他能使马群肥壮过冬。冬天，在平原上放牧。他牵着马，跟着马，慢慢地让马吃草，免得雪草被马蹄踏实，马吃不上草。秋天，他在中午饮马，免得马饮早了晚上不好好吃草——“马无夜草不肥”。夏天，他在早晚饮马，因为晌午饮马，马进水中不爱出来，且易得马蹄病。做到早晨饮马，又可避免汗病。他谈到放牧经验时说：“要四季水草调换好，随着草走，放牧时不让马快跑，不叫马挤在一起。应该白天黑夜跟着马群，才能保证马不受任何损失。”在哈音金的看管下，马群从来未被狼咬过一匹。这些牧养技术和经验确实是一般牧人不容易做到的，这就是哈音金成为劳模的原因之一。
    当他在三十岁的那年，他替一家牧主放马，原来只有四百匹的马群，经他四年的精心放牧，马群竟增加到一千匹。有一年下了一百五十匹驹子，同时作到了没有一匹死亡。可是牧主对他怎样呢？当哈音金在回忆这事情时是十分伤心的。哈音金替牧主放马，虽然一年到头风霜雨雪日夜辛勤，但不用说米面吃不上，就是到了冬天也只吃点头蹄下水（羊肠之类）。当哈音金再也不能忍受，决定离开这家牧主的时候，牧主仅仅给他一匹马，而且是“赏赐”的。
    但是，共产党给牧民们带来了幸福。哈音金在党和人民政府发展牧业经济的政策下，现在他已经有了八匹马，五头牛，三只羊，一个蒙古包，一辆牛车，并娶了老婆。
    一九四八年，他以繁殖四十匹马立功被选为盟的劳动模范。其中有不到繁殖年龄的十九匹马，经他细心分群交配，也繁殖了六匹。同时，还打死大小狼十四只，减少了对牲畜的危害。
    今年五月锡盟风雪成灾，哈音金放牧的马群，由于经管细心，损失微小。他在暴风雪中，与寒冷搏斗了一天两夜。为了不冻死马，他有时赶着马儿跑，有时又让马站在那儿吃草。他来回地赶着马儿跑着，运动着，全身发热，于是终于战胜了风雪灾害。在暴风雪中，大家以为老头儿（指哈音金）冻死了，马群也已没有了。但当他战胜灾害，赶着马群在大家面前出现的时候，大家是那么热烈地欢迎他，爱戴他，慰问他。
    这次被选为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议代表，这是哈音金想不到的事情。他觉得自己是一个蒙古草原的牧人，从来没有参加过这样的盛会，害怕自己讲不出话来；他曾请人把他的放牧情形写出来，报告给毛主席。
