　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: The "Pravda" of the 15th published a special article by Soviet Minister of Agriculture Benediktov, discussing the impact of the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal on the development of animal husbandry and agriculture in the region, stating: Currently, the collective farms located in the canal area own approximately 600,000 goats and sheep, 70,000 head of beef cattle and dairy cows, and approximately 19,000 camels. Moreover, they also raise Astrakhan sheep and fat-rumped sheep. After the canal diverts water to 7 million hectares of pasture, it will greatly increase the feed base in the Turkmen Republic, thereby promoting the development of animal husbandry. The number of sheep, beef cattle, dairy cows, and camels will increase sixfold, and the productivity of livestock products will also greatly increase.

　　The article continued: The Grand Canal will more than double the area of irrigated land in the Turkmen Republic and more than double the irrigated area in the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic. These irrigated lands will be mainly used for planting cotton, as well as rice, vegetables, potatoes, and other crops to meet the needs of the industrial centers in western Turkmenistan.

　　The article concluded: The decisions of the Soviet Council of Ministers regarding the construction of the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations, the decision to excavate the Turkmen Grand Canal, and the decision to adopt new irrigation systems have opened a new page in the history of agriculture. In the near future, the waters of the Volga and Amu Darya rivers will irrigate hundreds of thousands of hectares of newly reclaimed land on collective farms and state farms. Large-scale irrigation work has already been carried out in the Volga Basin and the Central Black Earth Region, in the Rostov Oblast, Transcaucasian, and Central Asian republics. After the implementation of Stalin's farmland irrigation plan, the production of grain, industrial crops, vegetables, and fruits in the irrigated areas will increase several times, and the impact of drought will be eliminated, ensuring good harvests every year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: The director of the Irrigation Department of the Soviet Hydroelectric Engineering Design Bureau and Stalin Prize winner, Zhubrik, told a TASS reporter regarding the Soviet government's order to excavate the Turkmen Main Canal: Following the issuance of the two significant orders concerning the construction of the world's largest Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station and the Stalingrad hydroelectric power station, the government has now issued an order to excavate the Amu Darya-Krasnovodsk Canal. This is a great new contribution to the Stalinist plan for transforming nature currently being carried out in the Soviet Union, and it proves the indomitable will of the Soviet people to engage in peaceful and creative work.

　　The Amu Darya-Krasnovodsk Canal will bring life to 1.3 million hectares of desert and will supply water to nearly 7 million hectares of pastures in the Kara-Kum Desert. New life: cotton fields, gardens, vineyards, and forests will flourish along the entire canal line, along the irrigation canals. It will fundamentally change the nature of the desert, change the climate, and stop the movement of sand.

　　As is well known, the Amu Darya, one of the largest rivers in Central Asia, has until now been rarely utilized. The torrents of the Amu Darya have always flowed into the inland Aral Sea without being utilized. In the areas through which the Amu Darya flows, there are vast and boundless plains that are dry due to lack of water. If irrigated, these lands will be able to grow the most valuable varieties of cotton and other crops.

　　Such a huge transformation of water-deficient deserts is only possible in a socialist country. In the future, the Turkmen Main Canal from the Amu Darya to Krasnovodsk will become a rushing artery, bringing life to vast lands.

　　The canal will cross the Kara-Kum and flow into the Caspian lowlands of western Turkmenistan. Its starting point will be at Takhiatash, a narrow section of the Amu Darya. Moreover, locks and hydroelectric power stations will be built on the Amu Darya. In this area, several irrigation canals will be built from the locks. This entire system will divert water to irrigate 500,000 hectares of fertile land in the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic and the northern states of Turkmenistan, and to irrigate 300,000 hectares of land near the Amu Darya delta. The irrigation of these lands will restore the landscape of ancient Khorezm (i.e., modern-day Khiva), the old state of which Soviet archaeologists have recently discovered. The canal will draw 350 to 400 cubic meters of water per second from the Amu Darya, thus turning it into a navigable river.

　　Where only a few unknown wells supply a small amount of brackish water to passing camel caravans, this canal will flow into the natural riverbed of the Uzboy River, which the Amu Darya once flowed along into the Caspian Sea. However, at that time, the Amu Darya's riverbed was not in the form that Soviet technicians have now determined. In ancient times, the Amu Darya flowed with many tributaries into a large lake, which is now the dry Sarygamysh Depression, which is tens of meters deep. If the current Sarygamysh Depression is to be used as a ready-made reservoir, it must be filled with water, and this work will take more than 15 years. It is unreasonable to make such a decision. Therefore, an artificial canal must be dug, bypassing the Sarygamysh Depression. Modern technology makes it possible for us to make the time for excavating this canal incomparably shorter than the time required to fill the depression. Subsequently, the water will flow along the Uzboy. Hydroelectric power stations will be built where the Uzboy Riverbed is wide. In addition, there are plans to build two locks and water volume regulation reservoirs on the Uzboy River. A total of 500,000 hectares of land will be irrigated in the southern states of the Caspian lowlands of western Turkmenistan. That is to say, between Mali Balkan and the Atrek River, on the western hills of the Kopet Dag Mountains and the coastal beaches, new life will spring up. The vast deserts will give way to lush fields, and rows of trees and forest protection belts will emerge, fundamentally changing the living conditions of existing residential areas, and millions of villages will appear here.

　　The government has ordered and stipulated the construction of thousands of kilometers of large water pipes to supply water to industrial enterprises and residential areas. This means that in Krasnovodsk, which still needs to be supplied with fresh water, trees will be planted along the streets, many parks will be established in the city, and fresh vegetables will grow in the fields in the suburbs. Coastal residents will also obtain these conditions. The clear water flowing from this Turkmen Main Canal will create new possible conditions for industrial development in this region.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th: Dozens of research institutes of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and a large number of experts will participate in the construction project of the Turkmen Grand Canal, which the Soviet Council of Ministers recently decided to build. Several survey teams sent by the Soviet Academy of Sciences are studying the natural conditions and geological structure of the area near the construction site, and are studying the most reasonable irrigation and cultivation methods in desert areas.

　　斯大林改造自然计划的伟大新贡献
    土库曼大运河远景无限美好
    将给广大沙漠带来新的生命并繁荣滋长
    大批苏联科学家将参加建筑工程及从事有关研究工作
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十五日的真理报发表苏联农业部长比尼迪克托夫所撰专文，论述建造土库曼大运河对于发展该地区牲畜业与农业的影响称：目前，座落在运河区内的各个集体农场，约拥有六十万头山羊和绵羊、七万头食用牛和乳牛以及约一万九千只骆驼，而且还饲养着阿斯特拉罕种羊和肥臀羊。运河引水至七百万公顷的牧场后，将使土库曼共和国的饲料基地大大增加，从而促进牲畜业的发展，羊、食用牛、乳牛、骆驼的头数将增加六倍，牲畜产物生产率也将大大增加。
    该文继称：大运河将使土库曼共和国灌溉土地的面积增加一倍以上，使卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国的灌溉面积超出目前的二倍以上。这些受灌溉的土地将主要用来植棉，此外，还将种植稻米、蔬菜、马铃薯及其他作物，以供土库曼西部的工业中心之需。
    该文结语称：苏联部长会议关于建筑古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水力发电站的决定，关于开凿土库曼大运河的决定，以及关于采用新的灌溉系统的决定，已打开了农业史上新的一页。在不久的将来，伏尔加河和阿姆河的河水，将灌溉集体农场和国营农场数十万公顷新开垦的土地。在伏尔加流域和中央黑土地带，在罗斯多夫州、外高加索和中亚各共和国里，本来已经进行了大规模的灌溉工作。实行了斯大林农田灌溉计划以后，灌溉地区的谷物、工业作物、蔬菜和水果的生产将增加数倍，并将免除旱灾的影响而确保年年丰收。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日电：苏联水力工程设计局灌溉处主任、斯大林奖金获得者朱布里克顷就苏联政府发布关于开凿土库曼主干运河的命令告塔斯社记者称：紧接着关于建筑世界上最大的古比雪夫水力发电站和斯大林格勒水力发电站这两个有意义的命令颁布以后，政府又颁布了开凿阿姆河——克拉斯诺伏斯克运河的命令，这对苏联目前进行的斯大林改造自然计划是个伟大的新贡献，并且证明了苏联人民从事和平的创造性工作的不屈不挠的意志。
    阿姆河——克拉斯诺伏斯克运河将给一百三十万公顷的沙漠带来生命，将供应卡拉·库姆沙漠中近七百万公顷牧场的用水。新的生命：棉田、花园、葡萄园、森林将沿着运河全线，沿着灌溉渠发荣滋长。并将根本改变沙漠的性质，改变气候，制止沙土的流动。
    如所周知，中亚细亚最大河流之一的阿姆河一直到现在都很少利用。阿姆河的滔滔河水始终未经利用便流入内陆的咸海了。而在阿姆河流经地区却有着广漠无垠的原野因缺水而干燥，如果加以灌溉，这些土地将能生长最有价值的各种棉花及其他农作物。
    使缺乏水分的沙漠发生这样巨大的转变，只有在社会主义国家里才有可能。将来从阿姆河至克拉斯诺伏斯克这条土库曼主干运河将变成一条滔滔滚滚的大动脉，给广漠的土地带来生命。
    该运河将横跨卡拉·库姆流入土库曼西部的里海低地。它的起点将从阿姆河狭窄部分的塔赫亚·塔什开始。并且在阿姆河上还要建筑水闸和水力发电站。在这一地区，将从水闸处开始分筑若干灌溉渠。这整个系统将引水灌溉卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国和土库曼北部各州五十万公顷肥沃的土地，灌溉阿姆河三角洲附近三十万公顷的土地。这些土地的灌溉将使古代霍列森（按即今日之基发）的景象恢复起来，苏联考古学家最近已经发现该城旧日的情况了。该运河每秒钟自阿姆河流入的水量达三百五十至四百立方公尺，这样，它便会变成一条可以通航的河流了。
    在现在只有些不知名的荒井给过往的骆驼队供给少量咸水的地方，这条运河将流入乌兹波伊河的天然河床，阿姆河从前便曾经一度沿着这条河床注入里海。然而那时阿姆河的河道却不像苏联技师现在所决定的模样。在古代，阿姆河带着许多支流注入一个大湖，这个湖就是现在深达数十公尺的干燥的萨里·卡米什洼地。如要利用目前萨里·卡米什洼地作为现成的蓄水池，就必须用水灌满它，而这工作将需十五年以上的时间。作这样的决定是不合理的。所以要开凿一条人工的运河，绕经萨里·卡米什洼地。现代化的技术使我们有可能使掘凿这种运河的时间无可比拟地远较灌满低陷地所需时间为短。随后，河水便将沿着乌兹波伊流去了。在乌兹波伊河河身宽阔处将建设水力发电站。此外，还计划在乌兹波伊河上建设两个水闸和调节水量的蓄水池。从乌兹波伊河更将分筑许多灌溉渠和供水渠。在土库曼西部里海低地的南部各州合计将有五十万公顷的土地受到灌溉。这就是说，在马利·巴尔汗与亚特列卡河之间，在柯贝特·达格山脉西部的山岗和沿海的沙滩之间，新的生命将滋生起来。漫漫的沙漠将让位于葱绿的田畴，成行的树木和森林防护带即将涌现，从根本上改变现有住宅区的生活条件，而且千百万个村庄将在这里出现。
    政府命令并规定建造数千公里的大水管以供应各工业企业及居宅区的用水。这就是说，在至今尚需供应清水的克拉斯诺伏斯克，沿着街道都将种植树木，城内将设立许多公园，郊外田地里将生长新鲜的蔬菜。沿海的居民也将获得这些条件。从这条土库曼主干运河流出的清水将给这一地区开创工业发展的新的可能条件。
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：苏联科学院的几十个研究所及大批专家，将参加苏联部长会议最近决定建造的土库曼大运河的建筑工程。由苏联科学院派出的几个勘测队，正在研究建筑现场附近地区的自然条件及地质构造，并研究沙漠地区最合理的灌溉与耕种方法。
