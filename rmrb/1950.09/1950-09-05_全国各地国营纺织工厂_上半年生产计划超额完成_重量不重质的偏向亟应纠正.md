　　[This News Report] National state-owned cotton textile factories overcame the unexpected difficulties caused by the "February 6th" bombing of Shanghai in the first half of this year and completed their planned production. Cotton yarn production reached 100.18% of the plan, and cotton cloth production reached 105.26%. Shanghai did not fulfill its production plan for the first quarter due to the impact of the "February 6th" bombing, but most regions across the country exceeded their planned production for the first half of the year. Among them, Dalian-Lushun, Southern Jiangsu, and Tianjin exceeded the most in cotton yarn production: Dalian-Lushun exceeded by 20.16%, Southern Jiangsu by 19.78%, and Tianjin by 6.71%. The Northeast, Dalian-Lushun, and Tianjin exceeded the most in cotton cloth production: Dalian-Lushun completed 116.18%, the Northeast completed 111.6%, and Tianjin completed 105.47%.
    
    In the past six months, the production efficiency of state-owned textile factories has generally been increasing month by month. The average output per spindle per 20 hours of 20-count yarn at Tianjin China Textile No. 1 reached 1.122 pounds in June, and Qingdao China Textile reached 1.024 pounds, both of which exceeded the highest output during the Japanese puppet period. Shanghai factories have also reached 0.963 pounds. The Northwest Textile Construction Company's output per spindle was only 0.733 pounds in March, but it has increased to 0.831 pounds in June. At the same time, consumption rates have gradually decreased, and the number of workers being laid off has gradually decreased.
    
    The ability of state-owned textile factories to complete and exceed their production plans in the past six months is mainly due to the increased awareness of the masses of workers and staff, the change in labor attitudes, the joint leadership of production by trade unions and administration, the launch of production competitions, and the improvement of management and technology. The relationship between bureaus (companies) and factories has begun to become closer. Since March of this year, Tianjin China Textile Company has been conducting inspections of various factories on a rotating basis, strengthening the company's understanding of the factories and correcting the past tendency of leading from offices based solely on official documents and reports. Factories management committees have been established successively in various places (Shanghai has not established all of them), contact contracts have been established, a shift handover system has been established, and rationalization proposals have been developed. Tianjin China Textile has received 193 rationalization proposals in the past six months, and Qingdao China Textile had received 145 proposals by the end of May. Various regions have also successively begun to unify cotton blending, reduce the sizing rate of cotton cloth, and implement the decision on periodic maintenance work in accordance with the operating standards decided at the National Textile Industry Conference in March. The inspection team of the Central Textile Department, with the participation of Soviet experts, has promoted research and attention to maintenance work in various regions. Tianjin China Textile once held a maintenance professional conference and drafted a draft of the maintenance work system. The promotion of the maintenance method has also promoted the improvement of the operation method. The workers of the Dalian Jinzhou Textile Factory proposed 4,282 technical operating procedures, which were finally reviewed, revised, merged, and supplemented by the Workers' Congress into 1,070 items, which have been implemented throughout the factory. The Northeast Textile Management Bureau issued the technical management rules of Soviet cotton textile factories. Qingdao workers also put forward opinions on working methods. The gradual establishment of working methods has greatly improved work efficiency.
    
    However, many state-owned textile factories still have serious problems in management and production. Generally, there has been a tendency to emphasize quantity over quality in various regions, and the defective product rate in individual regions (such as Shanghai) has not only not decreased, but has instead increased. During the mold season, due to the failure to take preventive measures, a large amount of cotton cloth and burlap became hot, and even partially moldy, causing losses to the country. At the same time, waste is still very common, and there have been incidents of unplanned ordering of machinery, materials, and raw materials, as well as violations of cash management regulations. Most regions' bureaus (companies) still lack specific leadership and inspection of the factories. The leading cadres of the factories are also often trapped in administrative matters and do not go deep into the workshops to focus on leading production. Some leading cadres and staff have insufficient understanding of relying on the working class, do not understand how to manage factories using new management methods, and still retain the old bureaucratic style, resulting in some factories not yet having established factory management committees, and some factories that have already established management committees often becoming formalities. In order to improve the above shortcomings, textile bureaus (companies) and state-owned textile factories in various regions should check their work style in this rectification movement, correct shortcomings, clarify the idea of ​​relying on the working masses to run factories well, conscientiously implement democratic management, and at the same time, must systematically establish a series of systems, including the establishment of economic accounting system, pay attention to and adopt advanced working methods, in order to consolidate the existing output and improve quality.

### 全国各地国营纺织工厂  上半年生产计划超额完成  重量不重质的偏向亟应纠正

　　全国各地国营纺织工厂
    上半年生产计划超额完成   
    重量不重质的偏向亟应纠正
    【本报讯】全国国营棉纺织厂在今年上半年内，克服了上海“二六”轰炸所造成的意外困难，完成了预定的产量。计棉纱完成百分之一○○·一八，棉布完成百分之一○五·二六。上海因受“二六”轰炸的影响，第一季度未完成生产计划，但全国各地大都超过半年预定产量。其中棉纱以旅大、苏南、天津三地超额最多：旅大计超额百分之二○·一六，苏南超额百分之一九·七八，天津超额百分之六·七一。棉布则以东北、旅大、天津三地超额最多：旅大完成百分之一一六·一八，东北完成百分之一一一·六，天津完成百分之一○五·四七。
    半年来，各国营纺织厂生产效率一般都在逐月上升。天津中纺二十支纱每锭二十小时的平均产量，六月份达到一·一二二磅，青岛中纺达到一·○二四磅，均已超过日伪时期最高产量。上海各厂也已达到○·九六三磅。西北纺建公司三月份每锭产量仅○·七三三磅，至六月份已提高至○·八三一磅，同时消耗率陆续降低，扯工逐渐减少。
    国营纺织厂半年来能完成和超额完成生产计划，主要是由于职工群众觉悟程度的提高，劳动态度的改变，工会与行政共同领导生产，发动了生产竞赛，改进管理和技术所得来的。局（公司）厂之间的关系已开始密切，天津中纺公司从今年三月起经常有重点的轮流到各厂进行考察，加强了公司对各厂的了解，纠正了过去单凭公文和报告坐在屋里领导的偏向。各地都已先后成立工厂管理委员会（上海没有全部建立），订立联系合同，建立交班制度，开展了合理化建议。天津中纺半年来收到合理化建议一百九十三件，青岛中纺至五月底也收到一百四十五件。各地并先后按照三月全国纺织工业会议所决定的经营标准，开始统一混棉，减低棉布含浆率，实行周期保全工作的决定。有苏联专家参加的中央纺织部的视察组，促进了各地对保全工作的研究和重视。天津中纺曾召开了一次保全专业会议，拟具了保全工作制度草案。由于保全工作法的推进，又推动了运转工作法的改进。大连金州纺织厂全厂工人提出了技术操作规程四千二百八十二条，最后经工代大会审查修正归并补充为一千零七十条，并已在全厂实行。东北纺管局印发了苏联棉纺织厂的技术经营规则。青岛职工也提出了有关工作法的意见。由于工作法的逐步建立，大大地提高了工作效率。
    但是许多国营纺织厂在管理和生产中仍然存在着严重问题。各地一般地发生了重量不重质的偏向，个别地区（如上海）的次货率不仅不见减低，反而增加。在霉季中，由于未能预为防范，大量的棉布和麻袋发热，甚至部分发霉，给国家造成了损失。同时浪费现象还很普遍，发生过无计划的订购机器物资原料的事件及违犯现金管理的现象。大多数地区的局（公司）对各厂还缺乏具体的领导与检查。厂的领导干部也经常陷于事务问题上，没有深入车间着重领导生产。部分领导干部和职员对依靠工人阶级认识不足，不懂得运用新的管理方法管理工厂，依然保留着旧的官僚主义作风，致有的厂至今还未成立工厂管委会，有些已成立管委会的工厂，也往往流于形式。为改进以上缺点，各地纺织局（公司）和各国营纺织厂应在这次整风中检查自己的工作作风，纠正缺点，明确依靠工人群众搞好工厂的思想，认真实行民主管理，同时必须有系统地建立一系列的制度，包括建立经济核算制在内，重视和采纳先进工作方法，以巩固现有产量，提高质量。（中央纺织工业部通讯组）
