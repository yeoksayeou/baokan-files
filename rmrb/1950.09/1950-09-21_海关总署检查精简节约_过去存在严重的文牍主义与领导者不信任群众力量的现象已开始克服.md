　　General Administration of Customs Inspects Streamlining and Thrift
    The serious bureaucracy and the phenomenon of leaders distrusting the power of the masses that existed in the past have begun to be overcome

    [By this newspaper] The General Administration of Customs of the Central People's Government conducted a streamlining and thrift inspection campaign in late July, following instructions from the Government Administration Council. The campaign lasted for more than twenty days and concluded in mid-August. During the inspection campaign, everyone put forward opinions very enthusiastically. The "Inspection Group" responsible for leading this campaign, after synthesizing the opinions put forward by various units, conducted key reviews and adopted the opinions in a timely manner. Various tasks have been corrected. Based on this inspection, the following shortcomings were discovered:

    (1) In terms of work style and work system, some leading cadres have relatively serious bureaucratic, administrative, and red tape styles. The masses have a lot of criticism in this regard. The general opinion is that these leading cadres are busy with meetings, busy with administrative affairs, and busy with reviewing official documents. They take on all matters, big and small, and do not frequently or rarely do planning, deployment, promotion, inspection, and summary of the work of their own units. Some units have never summarized their work since their establishment nearly a year ago. A system of layered responsibility and scientific division of labor has not been well established, resulting in an uneven distribution of labor where the top is busy, the bottom is chaotic, some are busy, and some are idle. This greatly affects the enthusiasm and creativity of the cadres. In handling problems, there is generally insufficient mutual consultation and research. Most just sign opinions on official documents, resulting in a "paper chase" where opinions are sent back and forth, and the problem is not solved.

    There are two main reasons for the formation of this bureaucracy, administrative style, and red tape. One is the traditional bureaucratic style of the old customs under imperialist rule: superiors only command and control subordinates, are unwilling or unable to discuss matters with everyone, lack a mass perspective, and distrust the power of the masses. This is the main reason. The second is that a few cadres from the old liberated areas still lack the concept of establishing a formal system and are not good at using complex organizational forms to make it operate like a machine. In addition, because the General Administration of Customs was established not long ago, most cadres are not proficient in the policies, guidelines, and new business techniques of the new customs, which also greatly affects the work.

    (2) In terms of cadre allocation and use, on the one hand, there are not enough cadres (still lacking forty-seven people according to the new establishment), and on the other hand, there is also a waste of manpower due to insufficient organization and failure to make the most of the talents of a few cadres. For example, the entire agency has only more than 200 employees, but the cooperative uses two cadres and one worker. In understanding cadres' viewpoints, some leading comrades have a conservative, purely technical viewpoint, only valuing old business experience and seniority in the old customs, and failing to understand cadres from the perspective of comprehensive development of political quality and business ability. This viewpoint affects the correct understanding, use, and training of cadres. On the other hand, some cadres still have some incorrect viewpoints in their thinking. Some comrades emphasize personal interests and are not enthusiastic about work they are not interested in; some emphasize personal development and feel depressed about work that "does not have much development"; some feel that they are being underutilized and are dissatisfied with their current positions and treatment; some still have a strong mercenary viewpoint, doing as much work as they are paid for, and not regarding studying business and improving their political and ideological level as their own responsibility.

    (3) Although there is no serious waste in financial expenditure, it has not yet reached the standard of careful calculation and strict budgeting. Most of the existing houses are old and dilapidated, and repairs often excessively seek cheapness, resulting in incomplete projects and repeated repairs becoming a waste. Automobile fuel consumption has saved 258 gallons compared to the budget in the past six months, but a strict system has not been established for the use of automobiles. In addition, the recent National Customs Affairs Conference exceeded the budget by nearly one-fifth due to a lack of careful calculation and strict budgeting.

    In response to these shortcomings, various units have put forward improvement suggestions. The responsible comrade of the General Office first reviewed his own leadership style and called on all cadres in the office to strictly implement the layered responsibility system and gradually achieve fixed staffing, fixed quotas, and fixed quantities. He started to formulate the scope of authority for cadres at all levels to handle official documents in order to overcome the administrative phenomenon of concentrating everything on one person, regardless of size. New adjustments and arrangements have been made for the receipt, dispatch, circulation, urging, filing, and telegram processing of official documents. A special person has been designated to be responsible for the organization and preparation of various meetings. In addition, a collective office system has been established, and the use of telephones and face-to-face discussions to solve problems is encouraged. In terms of staffing, after careful research and based on actual work needs, the staffing was reduced from 310 to 280 people. The audit section of the Tariff Division and the audit group of the Statistics Division were combined to work together and be responsible separately, correcting the past phenomenon of redundant work and waste in the two units. In terms of cadre allocation, adjustments have been made based on the inspection results. Therefore, cadres reflected: "This inspection has really achieved results." Recently, preparations are being made to conduct democratic appraisals and adjust salaries. In terms of general affairs, regulations have been made for the use of automobiles, the method of receiving stationery has been strictly enforced, the management procedures of the canteen have been simplified, and one cadre and two workers have been withdrawn, and the cooperative has also reduced one cadre, without affecting the work.

    The following two experiences have been gained through this inspection:

    (1) A layered responsibility system must be established to overcome bureaucracy and administrative style in leadership and to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of cadres. To establish a layered responsibility system, leading cadres must first establish a mass viewpoint and value the power of the masses. On the one hand, it is necessary to trust cadres, and on the other hand, it is necessary to constantly train cadres. Secondly, when establishing a layered responsibility system, it must be combined with the reporting system, otherwise, it is easy to develop a tendency of being unorganized and undisciplined.

    (2) Regular and frequent inspection work is one of the important methods to improve work. The General Administration of Customs has not done enough in this area in the past, so many shortcomings have existed for a long time without being discovered, or although there was a feeling, they were not corrected in time. After this inspection, these shortcomings have been corrected. In the future, a regular inspection system must be implemented to ensure the continuous improvement of our work.

### 海关总署检查精简节约  过去存在严重的文牍主义与领导者不信任群众力量的现象已开始克服

　　海关总署检查精简节约
    过去存在严重的文牍主义与领导者不信任群众力量的现象已开始克服
    【本报讯】中央人民政府海关总署于七月下旬遵照政务院指示，进行了精简节约检查运动，历时二十余天，已于八月中旬结束。在检查运动中，大家提的意见非常踊跃。负责领导这一运动的“检查分组”，于综合各单位所提意见后，进行了重点复查，并及时的采纳意见，各项工作已获改正。根据这次检查，发现了以下的缺点：
    （一）在工作作风与工作制度方面，部分领导干部存在着比较严重的官僚主义、事务主义、文牍主义作风。群众对这方面的批评很多，一般的意见是这些领导干部多忙于开会，忙于事务，忙于批阅公文，大小事务都揽在一个人身上，而对本单位工作的计划、布置、推动、检查和总结做的不经常或者很少做，有的单位自成立至今将近一年，从未总结工作。没有很好的建立分层负责、科学分工的制度，形成上面忙、下面乱、有人忙、有人闲的劳逸不均现象，这样就大大的影响了干部的积极性和创造性。在处理问题上，一般对互助商讨研究做得不够，多在公文上签注意见，结果你一张条子，我一张条子，来回传送，形成“公文旅行”，意见得不到统一，而问题亦未能解决。
    形成这种官僚主义，事务主义与文牍主义作风的主要原因有二。一是来自旧海关在帝国主义统治下传统的官僚主义作风：上级对下级只是命令支配，有事不愿或不善于与大家商量，缺乏群众观点，不信任群众力量，这是主要的。其次是少数老解放区来的干部还缺乏建立正规制度的观念，不善于运用复杂的组织形式，使它像一部机器一样的运转。此外，因海关总署成立不久，一般干部对新海关的政策方针和新的业务技术不够熟练，也大大的影响了工作。
    （二）在干部配备与使用方面，一方面是干部不够用（按照新编制尚缺四十七人），另方面也因组织得不够紧密和对少数干部没有做到才尽其能，存在着人力浪费的现象。如全署仅有职工二百余人，而合作社却用了干部二人、工友一人。在了解干部的观点上，一部分领导同志存在着保守的单纯的技术观点，只重视旧的业务经验和老海关的年资，未能从政治质量、业务能力全面的发展的观点来了解干部，这种观点就影响了对干部正确的了解、使用和培养。另方面，在部分干部的思想上还存在着某些不正确的观点。有的同志比较强调个人兴趣，对于不感兴趣的工作不起劲；有的强调个人的发展，对“发展不大”的工作发生苦闷；有的自以为大材小用，不满现在的岗位和待遇；有的仍存在着浓厚的雇佣观点，拿多少钱作多少事，对钻研业务提高政治思想水平，不当作是自己的责任。
    （三）在财政支出方面虽无严重的浪费现象，但尚未做到精打细算的标准。现有房屋大部破旧，修理时常过分贪图便宜，以致工程做得不彻底，一再重修反成浪费。汽车用油半年来较预算省了二五八加仑，但对汽车的使用未建立严格的制度。此外，最近召开的全国关务会议，因未精打细算，超过预算近五分之一。
    针对这些缺点，各单位纷纷提出了改进的意见。办公厅负责同志首先对自己的领导作风作了检讨，号召全厅干部严格执行分层负责制，逐步做到定员定额定量。着手拟具各级干部处理公文职权的范围，以克服事无大小，都集中一人的事务主义现象。对公文收发、传阅、催办、归档及电报处理都作了新的调整和布置。指定了专人来负责各种会议的组织和准备。此外，并建立了集体办公制度，提倡用电话、砌头的方式来解决问题。在编制方面，经过缜密研究，按实际工作需要，把编制由三一○人减为二八○人。把税则处的审核科和统计处的审核组联合办公，分别负责，纠正了过去两个单位工作重复浪费的现象。在干部配备方面，已根据检查结果进行调整了，因此干部反映：“这次检查是真的收到效果了。”最近并准备进行民主鉴定调整薪资。在总务方面，已规定汽车使用办法，严格了文具领用办法，简化食堂管理手续，抽出了干部一人，工友二人，合作社亦减少干部一人，工作并未受到影响。
    通过这次检查，获得以下两点经验：
    （一）必须建立分层负责制才能克服领导上的官僚主义与事务主义，才能发挥干部的积极性和创造性。而要建立分层负责制，则首先需要领导干部树立群众观点，重视群众的力量。一方面要信任干部，一方面要不断的培养干部。其次，在建立分层负责制时，必须与请示报告制度结合，否则，容易发生无组织无纪律的偏向。
    （二）定期的经常的检查工作是改善工作的重要方法之一。海关总署过去对这方面工作做得不够，以致许多缺点长期存在而未被发觉或虽有感觉却并未及时纠正，经过这次检查，这些缺点才得到了纠正。今后必须贯彻经常的检查制度，才能保证我们工作的不断提高。
