　　大田万余市民集会举行抗美反李示威
    【新华社平壤九日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社大田讯：大田市的工人、学生与市民一万余名，冒着美国侵略者空军机群的野兽般的轰炸，在职业同盟、民主青年同盟与妇女同盟的共同主持下，于四日晚举行了抗美反李的游行示威。高举着金日成将军与斯大林大元帅的巨幅画像和无数标语的示威群众，在大田市善化洞广场集合后，即开始了游行。“一切为了前线”、“彻底消灭美帝国主义侵略军队及其走狗李承晚残匪”、“英勇的人民军万岁”、“我们敬爱的领袖金日成将军万岁”的口号声响彻全城。
    参加游行的铁路工人李钟浩说：“我和许多同志的家全被敌机炸毁了，我心里充满了报仇的意志。”纺织工厂的女工李正子说：“美国鬼子的滥事炸射，决不能削弱我们的斗争意志，相反地，这只有加强我们对它的憎恨！”
