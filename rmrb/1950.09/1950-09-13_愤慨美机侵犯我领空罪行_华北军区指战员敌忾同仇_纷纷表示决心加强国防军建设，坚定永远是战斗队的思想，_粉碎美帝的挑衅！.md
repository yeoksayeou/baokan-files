　　Indignation at US Aircraft's Crime of Intrusion into Our Airspace
    Commanders and Fighters of the North China Military Region Share a Common Hatred of the Enemy
    They Express Their Determination to Strengthen the Building of National Defense Forces, Firmly Establish the Idea of Always Being a Combat Team, and Crush the Provocations of US Imperialism!
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The crime of US aircraft continuously intruding into our Northeast airspace has aroused great anger among all commanders and fighters of the North China Military Region. Many units have held forums to denounce the US imperialist aggression and support Foreign Minister Zhou's solemn protest to the US government. They are determined to strengthen the building of national defense forces, firmly establish the idea of always being a combat team, and crush the provocations of US imperialism.
    Comrade Ran Wenbin of the Communications Battalion of the ××× Army said: "This incident has made me more clearly aware of the major task of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and more firmly established the idea of always being a combat team. We must build a strong, modernized national defense force to defend the motherland and world peace." Yang Shizhen, a nurse directly under the army, said: "We should further improve our medical and nursing work, quickly cure the patients, return to our posts as soon as possible to study hard, train hard, and protect national defense."
    Hu Zhigui, a soldier of the × Regiment of the Chahar Military Region, said: "This aggressive action by US imperialism more clearly exposes its ambition to expand aggression. We must strengthen our studies, improve our military skills, vigilantly grasp our guns, and be sure to avenge the compatriots killed by US aircraft, defend national defense, and defend world peace."
    Wang Yinlong of the North China Military Region Garrison Force said: "We should train our troops well, study hard, improve our military skills, recognize the great significance of always being a combat team, and always guard the borders of the motherland."
    Zhang Huichuan, a 53-year-old comrade from the Chahar Military School, said: "Chiang Kai-shek sold the Northeast. I was ruined by the Japanese, my father was stabbed to death by the Japanese, my mother was frightened to death by the Japanese, and I almost lost my life. I fled alone to Guannei, and fortunately, I was rescued by the Communist Liberation Army. Now that Japan has been defeated and Chiang Kai-shek is about to be completely eliminated, US imperialism is here to cause trouble again. I am old and weak now and can't work in the army anymore, but I will let my son fight the robbers to the end."
    Comrade Sun Di continued: "The US imperialist air force's harassment in the Northeast further proves the importance of what Chairman Mao said about always being a combat team. As long as imperialism exists, we will fight them every day. I am a member of the Communist Youth League, I am a revolutionary fighter, and I must defend the motherland."

　　愤慨美机侵犯我领空罪行
    华北军区指战员敌忾同仇
    纷纷表示决心加强国防军建设，坚定永远是战斗队的思想，粉碎美帝的挑衅！
    【本报讯】美机连续侵犯我东北领空罪行，激起了华北军区全体指战员极大的愤怒，很多部队纷纷举行座谈会，斥责美帝侵略罪行，拥护周外长对美国政府的严正抗议。并决心加强国防军建设，坚定永远是战斗队思想，粉碎美帝的挑衅。
    ×××军通讯营冉文彬同志说道：“这次事件，我更加清楚的认识了中国人民解放军的重大任务，更加坚定了永远是战斗队的思想，我们必须建设一支强大的近代化国防军，保卫祖国，保卫世界和平。”军直护理员杨世珍说：“我们应当把医疗及护理工作再提高一步，迅速把病员治好，早回工作岗位努力学习，好好练兵，保护国防。”
    察哈尔省军区×团战士胡志贵说：“美帝国主义这种侵略行动，更明显的暴露了它扩大侵略的野心，我们一定加强学习，提高军事技术、警惕的握紧我们的枪杆子，一定要为被美机枪杀的同胞报仇，保卫国防，保卫世界和平。”
    华北军区警备部队王印龙说：“我们应该好好训练队伍，努力学习，提高军事技术，认清永远是战斗队的重大意义，永远守护着祖国的边疆。”
    察省军校五十三岁的张汇川同志说：“蒋介石出卖了东北，我被日本闹的家破人亡，父亲被日本刺死，母亲被日本吓死，差一点我没搭上命，我独自一人逃亡在关内，幸亏遇到共产党解放军救了我。现在日本被打败，蒋介石快彻底被消灭，美帝国主义又来捣乱，我现在年老体弱不能在部队干了，可是我要让我的儿子和强盗们干到底。”
    孙弟同志接着说：“美帝空军在东北扰害，更证明了毛主席说的永远是个战斗队的重要，帝国主义在一天，我们就和他们争一天，我是一个青年团员，我是一个革命战士，我一定要保卫祖国。”
