　　War Profiteers and War Swindlers
    Liu Zunqi
    The leading figures among the American war profiteers are now frantically trying to defend their aggression against Taiwan. Truman, Acheson, and their entire propaganda machine, under the watchful eyes and accusing fingers of the Chinese and peace-loving people of the world, have seen all their attempts to portray the crimes of American imperialism as complying with some kind of international obligation completely bankrupt.
    The most arrogant American warmongers are now revealing their true plans one by one.
    U.S. Secretary of the Navy Matthews openly declared in a speech on August 25 that the United States should "change" its Pacific policy and "compel peaceful cooperation at any cost, even the cost of war." He also said, "Although we will therefore receive the title of initiator of aggressive war," "we can accept it with a clear conscience."
    On August 27, MacArthur, in his telegram to the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, frankly confessed America's ambition to occupy Taiwan. In the most blatant terms, he announced that the United States must control Taiwan to form the so-called central hub of the U.S. Pacific natural defense line, and from this defense line "control with air power every Asian seaport from Vladivostok to Singapore."
    The White House and the State Department were in a hurry to "correct" these two statements. Matthews' words were declared "not to represent U.S. policy." Truman ordered MacArthur's statement to be "withdrawn."
    What caused the White House and the State Department to do this? Is it because Matthews and MacArthur represent one set of policies, while Truman and Acheson represent another?
    Of course not. On the contrary, precisely because Matthews and MacArthur bluntly stated the true intentions of the U.S. government, and even exposed everything the U.S. government is doing today, the U.S. White House and State Department had to deny it in such a hurry.
    The U.S. government's crime of aggression against Taiwan is no longer a secret plan, but a fact that has come out into the open. This fact is so blatantly sinful, so destructive of all the diplomatic promises it has made since the Cairo Conference, and so dangerously offensive to all the Chinese, all Asians, and all the people of the world, including the United States, that it is forced into a major contradiction: on the one hand, it must openly admit that all international promises, past and present, no longer constrain the increasingly expanding U.S. aggression; on the other hand, it must continue to deceive the people and its servant states to alleviate the political isolation of the U.S. aggressors.
    In fact, Acheson himself has already admitted that the U.S. action against Taiwan is a kind of "intervention." He only attempts to separate "intervention" from "aggression."
    In fact, no matter how hurriedly "corrected," the statements of Matthews and MacArthur have been published in all the reactionary newspapers in the United States. They wrote: In the final analysis, these military leaders' statements did not violate the policy of the U.S. government. If you don't believe it, look at Wallace, who now regrets his past words and deeds, wasn't he dismissed by Truman for speaking too weakly about Soviet policy? However, MacArthur received a special letter of praise from Truman the day after he was ordered to "withdraw" his statement!
    If the American people believe from Truman and Acheson's denials that the U.S. government is not currently engaged in a real war of aggression, they are not only selling themselves to a group of war profiteers, but also selling themselves to a group of war swindlers.
    When the U.S. armed forces are openly infringing upon China's Taiwan territory, Chinese territorial waters and airspace, when the U.S. aggressors, suffering shameful defeats in Korea, repeatedly strafe the peaceful residents on the border of Northeast China with their aircraft, and when the people of China and the people of the world are denouncing these war-provoking crimes of U.S. imperialism, who would believe the despicable lies Acheson uttered on August 30? -- "The United States is not taking aggressive action on Taiwan or any other issue... The United States is not acting or talking about mainland China in a hostile manner."
    If the American people have believed these lies of the leaders of the U.S. government until now, then they will know today how deeply these lies poison them personally. Just yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill by a vote of 354 to 20 that is tantamount to depriving the American people of all the basic rights and freedoms granted to them by the U.S. Constitution. According to this bill, any American can be sentenced to ten years in prison for "espionage" or "subversive activities."
    U.S. imperialism is not only disrupting world peace with open foreign aggression, but it is also actively turning the country into a police state, a country full of concentration camps, just like the German and Japanese fascists. This reality alone is enough for the American people to recognize what a dangerous path their rulers are leading them on.
    The American people, like the Chinese people, see very clearly that the adventurous acts of the American war profiteers will inevitably be subject to final sanctions. All their deceptions will become completely ineffective with these sanctions. The American people will not be buried with their rulers.

　　战争贩子与战争骗子
    刘尊棋
    美国战争贩子的首要人物为了辩解对台湾的侵略罪行已弄得手忙脚乱。杜鲁门、艾奇逊和他们的整个宣传机器，在中国和全世界爱好和平的人民十目所视、十指所指之下，想把美帝的罪行说成符合于什么国际义务的一切企图，已经完全破产。
    最狂妄的美国的战争挑拨者们现在是一个一个地说出他们的真正的计划了。
    美国海军部长马休斯在八月二十五日的演说中公开宣布美国要“改变”它的太平洋政策，而“不惜任何代价，甚至发动战争的代价，来强迫实现和平合作”。他又说，“虽然我们将因此得到侵略战争发动者的称号”，“我们可以心安理得地接受”。
    八月二十七日麦克阿瑟在他致美国海外退伍军人协会的电报中，坦白供认了美国侵占台湾的野心。他以最露骨的词句宣布美国必须控制台湾，以构成所谓美国太平洋天然防线中的总枢纽，并从这一防线“用空军控制自海参崴至新加坡的每一亚洲海港”。
    对于以上这两个声明，美国的白宫和国务院都急急忙忙起来“纠正”。马休斯的话被宣布为“并不代表美国的政策”。麦克阿瑟的声明则被杜鲁门下令“撤销”。
    什么原因促使白宫和国务院这样做呢？是因为马休斯与麦克阿瑟代表着一套政策，而杜鲁门与艾奇逊代表着另一套政策吗？
    当然不是的。恰恰相反，正因为马休斯和麦克阿瑟露骨地说出了美国政府的真实意图，甚至可以说，露骨地暴露了美国政府今天所做的一切，所以美国白宫和国务院才不得不这样慌忙的加以否认。
    美国政府对台湾的侵犯罪行已经不是什么秘密的计划，而是光天化日下公开出来的事实。这个事实是如此地罪恶昭彰，如此地破坏了它自从开罗会议以来的一切外交诺言，和如此危险地冒犯着全中国、全亚洲、和包括美国在内的全世界人民的大不韪，以至使它被迫陷入一个重大的矛盾之中，就是：它一面要公开承认，过去和现在的一切国际性诺言不再约束美国的日渐扩大的侵略行动，一面又要继续欺骗人民和它的仆从国家，以缓和美国侵略者在政治上的孤立地位。
    事实上，就是艾奇逊自己也已承认了美国对台湾的行动是一种“干涉”。他只企图将“干涉”和“侵略”分别开来。
    事实上，不管多么慌忙地加以“纠正”，马休斯与麦克阿瑟的声明都已在美国所有反动报纸上刊出了。它们这样写道：归根结底，这些军事领袖们的声明并没有违反美国政府的政策。如果不信，请看现已因他自己过去的言行而后悔了的华莱士，不是曾经因为将对苏政策说得过分软弱，而遭受杜鲁门的革职处分么？然而麦克阿瑟在奉令“撤销”它的声明的第二天却受到杜鲁门的专函表扬呢！
    如果美国人民从杜鲁门和艾奇逊的否认中相信美国政府目前还不是进行着真正的侵略战争，他们就不仅把自己出卖给了一群战争贩子，而且也把自己出卖给了一群战争骗子。
    当美国的武装部队公开地侵犯着中国的台湾领土，中国的领海和领空，当美国的侵略者在朝鲜遭受着可耻的失败之余：又一再以其飞机扫射我国东北国境上的和平居民时，当全中国人民和全世界人民都在声讨美帝国主义者这些战争的挑拨罪行时，有什么人会相信艾奇逊在八月三十日所说的这些卑劣的谎言呢？——“美国无论对台湾还是任何其他问题都不是采取着侵略行动……美国对于中国本土并不是以敌对方式动作着或谈论着。”
    如果美国人民迄今为止还有相信美国政府领袖们的这些谎言的，那么，他们在今天就会知道这些谎言对他们切身的毒害了。仅仅在昨天，美国众议院以三五四对二○票通过了一件等于从美国人民身上夺去美国宪法赋与他们的一切基本权利自由的法案。根据这个法案，任何美国人都可以“间谍”或有“颠覆性的活动”而判处十年徒刑。
    美帝国主义不仅以公开的对外侵略破坏着世界和平，它也正和德日法西斯完全一样，积极地把国内变成一个警察国家，一个布满集中营的国家。仅仅这样的现实就足以使美国人民认清他们的统治者把他们带上怎样危险的道路。
    美国人民和中国人民一样，看得很清楚，美国战争贩子的冒险行为必定受到最后的制裁。他们的一切蒙蔽欺骗将随着这种制裁而归于完全无效。美国人民是不会和他们的统治者一道殉葬的。
