　　Commanders and Fighters of Major Military Regions and Field Armies
    Enthusiastically Participate in Peace Signature Campaign
    "We Love Peace Very Much; But We Are Absolutely Not Afraid of War!"
    [This Newspaper's News] According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army in East China, Central and South China, Northwest China, Southwest China, and other regions are enthusiastically participating in the peace signature campaign.
            East China
    More than 65% of the commanders and fighters of the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army have already participated in the peace signature campaign. Various units are currently continuing to expand the peace signature campaign in conjunction with current affairs education opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea. The political departments of various units have issued notices calling on the troops to respond to the call of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace to strive for 200 million signatures nationwide, continue to carry out the signature campaign, and organize forces to cooperate with local governments, agencies, and mass organizations to carry out the peace signature campaign in urban and rural areas. The Wan'an Military Region troops have launched a campaign to mobilize each person to encourage eight to ten people to sign. Troops stationed in rural areas assist local governments in convening village meetings, or form groups to conduct door-to-door propaganda to mobilize farmers to sign the peace declaration. The Zhejiang Military Region's bandit suppression troops, when entering mountainous areas to suppress bandits, unfolded propaganda work along the way, exposing the rumors of bandits and special agents, enabling many residents to sign the peace declaration.
            Central and South China
    The peace signature campaign of the Central and South China Military Region and the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army has been enthusiastically launched. The number of signatures in most units has reached more than 80%. A certain unit that participated in the liberation of Hainan Island has almost completed the signature campaign. A certain unit that is attacking the Wanshan Islands, upon receiving the signature book for the defense of world peace, the soldiers rushed to sign on the decks of the ships. Twelve soldiers from a certain company guarding an iron bridge eight miles away from their station, upon hearing the news of the signature campaign, immediately took turns returning to the company to sign. Some illiterate soldiers asked people to teach them how to write their names overnight so that they could personally sign their names the next day. Severely wounded soldiers propped themselves up from their sickbeds and excitedly wrote their names on the peace declaration. From the river embankments under repair to the fields busy with summer farming, to the bandit suppression battlefields in the high mountains and ridges, soldiers everywhere are enthusiastically carrying out the peace signature campaign.
            Northwest China
    The Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically launched the peace signature campaign. Those who have already signed have reached 55% of the total number of troops. The number of signatures in a certain corps stationed in Shaanxi reached 100%. Various units, in conjunction with the signature campaign, are carrying out in-depth patriotic and internationalist education in the companies. Many units have convened peace signature conferences, and soldiers have rushed to submit letters of determination to defend peace to the conference. The soldiers of one unit wrote in their letter of determination: "Although we hold weapons in our hands, we love peace very much. At the same time, we are not afraid of war. If the imperialist warmongers dare to invade our motherland, then we will resolutely eliminate them!"
            Southwest China
    The commanders and fighters of the Southwest Military Region of the People's Liberation Army enthusiastically launched the peace signature campaign and actively mobilized the masses to participate in the signature campaign. When launching the peace signature campaign, various units generally held grand peace oath-taking rallies. All the commanders and fighters of a certain division wrote a letter to Chairman Mao expressing their determination to defend world peace with practical actions. Various units also combined the commemoration of "July 1st" and "August 1st" to carry out the anti-American aggression against Taiwan and Korea movement week, using exhibitions, recreational events, and the screening of lantern slides and films to conduct in-depth propaganda in rural areas. According to statistics from Dali, Xiaguan, Eryuan, and Menghua in Yunnan Military Region alone, more than 40,000 residents were mobilized to sign the peace declaration. The West Sichuan Military Region also mobilized 26,860 residents to sign. Troops engaged in bandit suppression and construction projects far away on the Xikang Plateau are also vying to sign. Fifty-seven Tibetan workers in a certain unit signed in both Tibetan and Chinese, and mobilized 5,767 Tibetan and Han residents to sign. The Guizhou bandit suppression troops have also extended this movement to the remote mountainous Miao areas.
