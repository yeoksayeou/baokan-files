    Xinhua News Agency, London, Thirteenth Dispatch: According to TASS, London: The London District Committee of the British Communist Party organized a mass rally attended by more than 3,000 people in the West End of London on the 10th, protesting the Labour government's three-year plan for military expansion and war preparations, announced in early August under the orders of the United States, which would cost 3.4 billion pounds, and the decision announced at the end of August to extend the term of military service from 18 months to two years.
    Garritt, secretary of the London District Committee of the British Communist Youth League, delivered a speech to the conference, denouncing the British government's war policy, saying: "While spending a huge sum of 3.4 billion pounds on military expenditure, 400 lung disease patients in Britain die every week due to lack of medical conditions." He said: "Young people, including many members of the Labour Youth League, have protested the war of aggression against Korea and the extension of the term of military service." A soldier's mother, Mrs. Middleton, called on British women at the meeting to persuade members of Parliament when the House of Commons discusses military appropriations and the extension of military service, telling them that world peace is closely related to the vital interests of British women. The Chairman of the British Communist Party, Gallacher, delivered a speech amid warm applause, pointing out that the real threat to Britain is the American imperialists who are preparing to use Britain as a base for aggression. "Submitting to the policies of the United States will bring disaster to Britain, that is, death and destruction." Finally, Mahon, secretary of the London District Committee of the British Communist Party, spoke, exposing that the United States is using Nazi generals, Greek fascists, De Gaulle, and Chiang Kai-shek as allies in preparing for an anti-Soviet war, while the Soviet Union is pursuing a consistent policy of peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Thirteenth Dispatch: The British peace signature campaign has achieved new success. According to the Telegraph Agency, London, Eleventh Dispatch: The British National Peace Council recently reported that 1,022,070 people nationwide have signed the peace declaration.

　　伦敦三千余群众集会  抗议英政府战争政策
    英国和平签名人数已逾百万
    【新华社十三日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国共产党伦敦区委会十日在伦敦西区蒙塔哥组织了有三千余人参加的群众大会，抗议工党政府在美国命令下于八月初宣布的耗资三十四亿英镑的扩军备战三年计划，和八月底发表的将兵役期限由十八个月延长到两年的决定。
    英国共产主义青年团伦敦区委书记加里特向大会发表演说，痛斥英政府的战争政策称：一面支出三十四亿英镑的巨额军费，一面英国每周却有四百名肺病病人却因缺乏医疗条件而死亡。他说：青年们包括许多工党青年团员，都已经抗议侵略朝鲜的战争和延长兵役期限。一个士兵的母亲密得顿夫人，在会上号召英国妇女在下院讨论军事拨款和延长兵役时向议员们进行说服，告诉他们世界和平与英国妇女们的切身利害休戚相关。英国共产党主席加拉赫在热烈的掌声中发表演说，她指出：真正威胁着英国的是准备把英国当作侵略基地的美国帝国主义者，“屈从美国的政策，将给英国带来灾难，这就是死亡与毁灭”。最后英共伦敦区委书记马洪讲话，他揭露美国在进行反苏战争的准备中，正把纳粹将领、希腊法西斯分子、戴高乐与蒋介石当作盟友。而苏联则执行着一贯的和平政策。
    【新华社十三日讯】英国的和平签名运动已获得新的成就。据电通社伦敦十一日讯：英国全国和平委员会最近统计，全国已有一百零二万二千零七十人在和平宣言上签了名。征集签名运动正在英国各地继续进行中。
