　　National Model Worker Representatives from Northeast China, Tianjin and Other Places
    Lead Workers to Launch Production Competition
    Lüda Glass Factory Completes Annual Production Task on August 28
    [Our Newspaper] National model worker representatives from Northeast China, Tianjin and other places are leading workers in their respective factories to launch production competitions with full labor enthusiasm. They want to greet the first National Day with new production victories. Production competitions between factories, workshops, and groups are burning and expanding everywhere like fire. This new heroic attitude towards labor demonstrates the working class's boundless love for the motherland.
    Forty-six candidates from Tianjin who attended the National Model Worker Representative Conference (including the nine elected national model worker representatives) jointly published a letter to all workers in the city on September 12, calling for a widespread and in-depth production competition to overfulfill the September production tasks as a gift to welcome National Day. More than 20 units, including Tianjin Steel Plant, Zhongfang, and Huadian, have launched mutual challenges. In its challenge to various factories in Tianjin, the No. 3 Plant of the Electric Power Bureau, in addition to guaranteeing no accidents for 100 days, will also reduce the coal consumption per kilowatt-hour to below 0.88 kilograms. A large number of workers in private factories have successively joined the upsurge of production competition.
    Zhao Guoyou, a national model worker representative from the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Factory, Wang Zhaoda, a national model worker representative from Lüda, and others have promoted the formulation of production plans to welcome National Day in all production groups in the factory, proposing the goals of improving quality, reducing costs, reducing waste, and eliminating defective products. All workers in Wang Zhaoda's group also guaranteed full attendance, not being late for one minute at work; guaranteeing that the four apprentices in the group will be able to independently operate a lathe at the fourth level by October 1; and helping the first group to produce no defective products in September.
    In order to welcome National Day and protest against the US imperialist aircraft's massacre of our compatriots in Northeast China, the Jilin State-owned Chemical Plant has launched a vigorous production competition in all departments and fields. Wang Yazhou, a national model worker representative of the factory, said: "Chairman Mao told us long ago that the United States is a paper tiger. As long as our working class unites, we are not afraid of US imperialism." The factory's lime kiln has already completed its annual production task on August 26 and exceeded it by more than 11 tons. All workers in the phosphorus production field proposed to complete the annual task on September 15. Under the leadership of Wang Yazhou, the carbide furnace workers guaranteed to complete the annual task on September 23 and report the victory to Chairman Mao. The workers also guaranteed that from the end of September to the end of December, they would produce another 35.18% of the annual task, guarantee no third-class products, and increase the attendance rate from 94% to 96%.
    Yin Xianming, a national model worker representative from the Zhengjiatun Inspection Section of Jinzhou, has ignited a production upsurge among all workers in the section. He led the workers in the entire mechanical room to formulate production competition conditions, guaranteeing to complete and exceed the task. He himself has been studying and transforming the grinding wheel early and late, and has already achieved great success.
    Liu Maoyou, a national model worker representative from the Lüda Yuandian Glass Factory, and his fellow workers adopted advanced Soviet experiences, boldly installed new equipment, and improved the glass production process. As a result, the guarantee letter submitted by the factory in July to complete 105% of the annual production task by October 1 in order to welcome National Day was fully and victoriously realized at 8:00 am on August 28, and exceeded the plan stipulated in the guarantee letter by 0.24%. Compared with the same period last year, the production rate increased by 18%; compared with the entire year of 1943 during the Japanese occupation, it increased by 248%. First-class products increased from the planned 30% to 68%, and third-class products decreased from the planned 30% to 15.7%. These achievements show that all the factory's employees have highly demonstrated revolutionary collective heroism.
