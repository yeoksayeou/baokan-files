　　Northeast Exemplary Representatives
    【This newspaper's report】The Northeast Region's combat heroes and model workers attending the National Combat Heroes Representative Conference and the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Model Workers Representative Conference sent a letter to this newspaper on September 26th, expressing their extreme anger at the aggressive act of American military aircraft bombing Andong and killing and injuring our people. The full text of their letter is as follows:
    "We are in Beijing, the capital of the Chinese people, attending the National Combat Heroes and Model Workers Representative Conference, when we suddenly heard that American imperialism invaded our airspace again on the 22nd and dropped twelve bombs on Andong City, injuring three of our compatriots and shattering most of the glass in houses within a radius of 500 meters. We express our utmost anger at this atrocity by the American imperialists. American imperialism invaded our airspace on the 27th and 29th of last month, strafing our workers and fishermen in the Northeast. The traces of blood have not yet dried, the injuries have not yet healed, and now they have come to invade, bomb, and wreak havoc. American imperialism has openly become the greatest enemy of the Chinese people and peace-loving people of the world. We, the Northeast combat hero representatives and model worker representatives, representing all the workers, peasants, and People's Liberation Army in the Northeast, lodge a serious protest against the American imperialists. Our brave and hardworking Chinese people have defeated Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by American imperialism, and are now building their own happy and prosperous lives. We are determined to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression, but we are also not afraid of any provocation by imperialism. If American imperialism dares to risk launching aggression, its final fate will inevitably be the same as that of Japanese fascism, to be defeated. We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's accusation and proposal representing the will of the entire Chinese people. We demand that the American government punish the culprits and compensate the Chinese people for their losses. We demand that the United Nations General Assembly immediately take effective measures to sanction the American crime of aggression and promptly withdraw American aggressive troops from Korea to restore peace in the Far East and the world. We also extend our sincere condolences to the three injured compatriots."
  Central South Military Region and Fourth Field Army Combat Hero Representatives
    【This newspaper's report】The combat hero representatives of our Central South Military Region and the Fourth Field Army expressed their unanimous support for Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement to the United Nations General Assembly on the 24th accusing American aircraft of invading our airspace again. Their infinite resentment was aroused by the American aggressive atrocities. They collectively signed a document on the morning of the 26th in support of Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. The full text of the signed document is as follows:
    We resolutely oppose the American imperialists' aggressive crime of invading our airspace again, killing and injuring our people, and destroying our property!
    We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou's accusation and statement to the United Nations General Assembly on September 24th. We demand that the United Nations General Assembly, which is in session, must include our proposal accusing the United States of invading our airspace on the agenda of the General Assembly, and our representatives must participate in the discussion.
    The United States is an aggressor and a destroyer of world peace. The United Nations must immediately sanction American aggressive behavior and withdraw its aggressive troops from Korea as soon as possible.
    We are combatants who defend the people's motherland and warriors who will always fight to protect the interests of the people. The American crime of aggression has aroused our extreme indignation and hatred. We are determined to better hold this combat hero representative conference, exchange experiences, improve tactics, and strive to prepare to meet the aggressors!
    The combat hero representatives who participated in signing in support of Foreign Minister Zhou's statement included Tower Hill Hero Bao Renchuan, Artillery God Cui Yongfeng, Model Instructor Liu Meicun, All-Around Merit Recipient Zhao Xingyuan and Lu Xiqin, Female Combat Hero Guo Junqing, Maritime Hero Pu Enshao, and Special Demolition Hero Cong Gui, among seventy-five people.
