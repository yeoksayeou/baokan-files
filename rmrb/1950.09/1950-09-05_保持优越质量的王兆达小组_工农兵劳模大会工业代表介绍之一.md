　　The Wang Zhaoda Group Maintains Superior Quality
    ——One of the Industrial Representatives Introduced at the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Workers, and Soldiers
    Editor's Note: Representatives attending the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Workers, and Soldiers have been successively selected from various regions. Their glorious deeds and advanced production experiences will be published continuously in this newspaper.

    The Wang Zhaoda Group is an advanced group at the Dalian Guanghe Machinery Factory that smoothly completes and exceeds its monthly tasks while guaranteeing quality specifications. It was awarded the honorary title of "Advanced Production Group" at the conference for rewarding advanced workers in January of this year. In the past six months, thanks to the help of the leadership and the efforts of himself and all the workers in the group, it has now become a banner for promoting the factory's production progress.

    The Wang Zhaoda Group had zero rejects or rework in January, February, March, and April of this year. In May, June, and July, only three rejects were produced (wasting only five hours). In August, the group again produced zero rejects. The main reason he was able to achieve this was the promotion of democracy within the group. After a task is assigned, workers are first called together to discuss it, and tasks are assigned based on the difficulty of the work, the workers' skill level, and the efficiency of the machines. Through this meeting, they also study what difficulties may be encountered in the work and how they should be resolved. This avoids the phenomenon of rejects being caused by insufficient technical conditions. At the same time, the group leader clearly explains the task when assigning it, clarifies the important points of the work and the tolerances, so that the workers pay attention to mastering them in their work. During production, the first finished product of each batch must be thoroughly inspected by the group leader, and only after it is deemed qualified can production continue. At the same time, the group leader uses the time between cuts to regularly check the work of the group members, so that deviations in the workers' work can be corrected in a timely manner. When encountering technical difficulties, he calls the group members together to study and come up with solutions together. If there are more difficult or theoretical problems, he takes the initiative to find technicians to help solve them. In this way, the elimination of rejects becomes possible.

    Exceeding the monthly task is also a characteristic of the Wang Zhaoda Group. The reason for this is that, on the one hand, the group leader promotes democracy and assigns tasks that are suitable for the technical abilities of the group members, so the group members are particularly enthusiastic about their work. On the other hand, the group leader can change the production organization in a timely manner according to the task situation. Under normal circumstances, individual piecework is implemented, but sometimes single-person piecework is not possible because the work cannot be separated, resulting in the phenomenon that difficult work cannot be completed and easy work is not enough. Therefore, the group leader proposed a method of "套着干," where the roughing process is done by workers with lower skills, and the difficult work and final finishing are done by workers with higher skills. This allows production tasks to be completed in a timely manner.

    The Wang Zhaoda group leader's careful planning overcomes the phenomenon of waiting for work and materials within the group. When each batch of tasks comes down, the group leader first considers it himself, so that he has a base in his mind, and then, according to the task and the requirements of the drawings, asks the apprentices to go to the material warehouse to collect the materials first (because there is often a phenomenon of untimely supply of raw materials) to prepare in advance. If the material warehouse does not have this kind of material, he notifies the procurement department in a timely manner. If it is difficult to buy for a while, he asks the production department to change the task. In this way, the group members can immediately continue to work on the next batch after finishing this batch, thus overcoming the unplanned phenomenon of waiting for work and materials.

    Strict shift handover and caring for machines are the Wang Zhaoda Group's consistent model actions. In the past, the factory did not have a shift handover system, and workers would throw away their tools and leave when they got off work. The next morning, they would have to waste fifteen minutes to count the tools, and the machines became increasingly dirty. Therefore, the Wang Zhaoda Group put forward the slogan "Prepare today, start early tomorrow." Every day after get off work, each worker's tools, drawings, finished products, semi-finished products, and raw materials are arranged neatly, so that they can start working early the next morning. This overcomes the phenomenon of wasted working hours. At the same time, after get off work, the workers each wipe their own machines clean, and the group formulates a pact to protect the machines. Because the machines in his group are well cared for, the machines have not had an accident during the overhaul period. At the same time, because the group leader pays attention to educating the group members politically, the phenomenon of group members arguing about work hour plans has been eliminated, and labor discipline can also be well observed.

    The advanced production experience of the Wang Zhaoda Group has been studied by the factory's Management Committee, and a production responsibility system has been formulated based on its advanced methods and has been comprehensively promoted, thus reversing the serious phenomenon of many rejects and rework at the Guanghe Factory in the past. For example, after the sixteen groups in the first and second mechanical workplaces learned from his advanced experience, nine groups did not produce a single reject in the entire month. Out of a total of one hundred and twenty-two people in the two workplaces, only ten people produced rejects, while in the past the number of people who produced rejects was always more than two-thirds. For example, the second mechanical workplace had 618 rejects and 814 reworks in March, but in May, June, and July, there were only 20-30 rejects, and rework was basically eliminated. According to statistics from the first half of July in the first mechanical workplace, 65 out of 68 people did not produce rejects. The first fitter shop has not produced any rejects from July to now. As a result, rejects and rework have been generally reduced in all workshops throughout the factory. The Wang Zhaoda Group's demonstration of wiping machines has led all the workers in the factory to formulate machine protection pacts, and they wipe the machines clean before leaving work. The model worker who cares for machines, Zhao Yongnian, has emerged. Therefore, the workers of the Guanghe Factory shouted: "Learn from the Wang Zhaoda Group!" (August 28, Dalian People's Daily)

　　保持优越质量的王兆达小组
    ——工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之一
    编者按：出席全国工农兵劳模大会的代表，各地已陆续选出。他们的光荣事迹和先进生产经验将在本报连续刊出。
    王兆达小组是旅大广和机械工厂每月顺利完成任务和超过任务，保证质量规格的先进小组；在今年一月份奖励先进工作者的大会上荣获“生产先进小组”的光荣称号；半年来由于领导上的帮助和他自己及该组全体工人的努力，现已成为推动全厂生产前进的旗帜了。
    王兆达小组今年一、二、三、四四个月全组不出一件废品及返手活，五、六、七三个月内只出了三件废品（只浪费五小时），八月份全组又未出一件废品。他所以能获得这种成绩，主要是在组内发扬了民主。凡任务下来以后，首先召集工人讨论，根据活的难易和工人的技术高低，机器的效能等分配任务。并通过这次会议，研究该活在工作中会遇到那些困难？应怎样解决？这样就避免了因技术条件不够而造成废品的现象。同时组长在派活的时候交代清楚，把活的重要地方和公差数交代清楚，使工人在工作中注意掌握。在制作中，每批活的头一个成品，须要经过组长详细检查，认为合格后才能继续制作。同时组长在工作中利用搭走刀的时间经常抽查组员的活，这样使组员工作中的偏差就能及时得到纠正。遇有技术上的困难时，就召集组员一块研究，由大家想出办法来克服。万一有更困难的或是带有理论性的问题时，就主动找技师帮助解决。这样，消灭废品才有了可能。
    月月超过任务，也是王兆达小组的一个特点。其原因：一方面是因为组长发扬民主，分配的活都适合于组员的技术能力，因此组员干起活来特别起劲。另一方面是组长能根据任务情况，及时改变生产组织。在正常情况下，是实行个人计件，但有时按单人计件，因为活分不开，形成难活干不完，容易活不够干的现象。因此组长就提出套着干的办法，将车粗拉荒的过程给技术低的工人干，难活及最后尖刀由技术高的工人干。这样就能及时完成生产任务了。
    王兆达组长的计划周密，克服了组内等工待料的现象。每批任务下来时，组长就先自己考虑一遍，使自己心里有个底子，然后再根据任务和图纸的规定，叫学徒先到材料库把料领来（因经常有原材料供给不及时现象），事先作好准备工作。如果材料库没有这种材料，就及时通知请购。如一时难以买得到，就要求生产科更换任务。这样能使组员干了这批活以后，马上就可以接着干下一批，这样，便克服了等工待料的无计划现象。
    严格交班制，爱护机器，是王兆达小组一贯的模范行动。该厂过去没有交班制度，下班时，工具一甩就走。次日早晨上班时，还得浪费十五分钟的时间来清点工具，机器也愈来愈脏。因此王兆达小组提出“今日准备好，明日动手早”的口号。每天下班以后，各个工人的工具、图纸、成品及半成品、原料等都收拾得整整齐齐，第二天早上上班时，就可以提前动手干活。克服了浪费工时现象。同时，在下班以后，工人们都各人把各人的机器擦干净，小组里订出保护机器的公约。因为他组里的机器爱护的好，在检修期内机器没发生一次事故。同时，由于组长对组员注意从政治上进行教育，使组员争论工时计划的现象消灭了，对劳动纪律也能很好遵守。
    王兆达小组的先进生产经验，通过该厂的管委会研究，并根据其先进办法制订了生产责任制，进行了全面的推广，因之扭转了广和工厂过去之废品多，返手活多的严重现象。如第一机械和第二机械职场共十六个小组学习了他的先进经验后，九个小组全月没出一件废品，两个职场共一百二十二人，只有十个人出了废品，而过去出废品的人数总在三分之二以上。如第二机械职场，三月份废品是六一八件，返工活八一四件，但五、六、七月份都只有二、三十件，并基本上消灭了返工活。第一机械职场根据七月份上半月统计，六十八人中就有六十五人没有出废品。第一钳工场从七月份到现在都没有出过废品。因之使全厂各场的废品返工活普遍减少。王兆达小组擦机器的示范行动，带动了全厂工人都制订出爱护机器公约，下班时擦好机器才走。并涌现了爱护机器的模范——赵永年工友。因此广和工厂的工人喊出：“向王兆达小组学习”（八月二十八日旅大人民日报）
