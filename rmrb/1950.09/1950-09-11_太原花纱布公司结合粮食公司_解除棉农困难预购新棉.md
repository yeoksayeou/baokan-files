　　Taiyuan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Combines with Grain Company
    Resolves Cotton Farmers' Difficulties and Pre-purchase New Cotton
    [Reported by this newspaper from Taiyuan] Before the new cotton in various parts of Shanxi Province comes on the market, it is a lean season. In particular, the Yuncheng cotton-producing area in southern Shanxi has suffered from drought, making it even more difficult for farmers to obtain food. As a result, many farmers pre-sell their soon-to-be-harvested new cotton; however, some private merchants take advantage of the masses' difficulties to depress prices and pre-purchase at low prices, greatly harming the interests of cotton farmers. To prevent farmers from suffering losses and protect their interests to expand cotton production, the Taiyuan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, with the approval of higher authorities in late August, joined forces with the Provincial Grain Company and entrusted the Provincial Cooperative to conduct pre-purchases of new cotton in the Yuncheng, Linfen, and Fenyang areas using grain, cash, and cloth. During the pre-purchase, farmers were free to choose whether they wanted grain, cash, or cloth. The Grain Company guaranteed the supply of grain. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company directly paid the Cooperative for the cloth and cash, and the Cooperative directly pre-purchased from the farmers. The current price of new cotton is set at seven catties of wheat per catty of standard lint, as stipulated by the Government Administration Council, for grain payment, or the equivalent value in cash or cloth. The deadline for delivery of cotton is no later than the end of October, guaranteeing full recovery of the amount. The grade will be adjusted according to the quality of the cotton delivered by the farmers, to ensure fairness and reasonableness without losses for either the farmers or the company. If the cotton price exceeds seven catties of wheat at the time of delivery, the masses will be compensated at the prevailing price; if the cotton price is lower than the standard of seven catties of wheat at the time of pre-purchase, the original seven catties will still be used for calculation, and no refunds will be given, to truly protect the interests of cotton farmers. In late August, the Provincial Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the Grain Company, and the Provincial Cooperative jointly issued instructions, urging immediate commencement of pre-purchases. The Grain and Cotton Yarn and Cloth Companies have been actively preparing materials based on the cotton production situation in various regions and the needs of the masses to vigorously carry out this work. At the same time, the Provincial Government also issued instructions, urging local governments to effectively lead and supervise the progress of this work.

　　太原花纱布公司结合粮食公司
    解除棉农困难预购新棉
    【本报太原讯】山西各地新棉尚未上市前，是一个青黄不接的时期。特别是晋南运城产棉区，曾遭受旱灾，农民愈感食粮困难。因此不少农民预卖将收之新棉；而一般私商却乘群众困难之际，压低价格，贱价预购，对种棉农民利益损失很大。太原花纱布公司，为不使农民吃亏，保护棉农利益，以扩大棉产起见，八月下旬征得上级同意，会同省粮食公司，委托省合作社举行以粮食、现款、布匹，在运城、临汾、汾阳三地区进行预购新棉。预购中农民愿要粮食或现款、布匹，均听其自便。粮食由粮食公司保障供给。布匹、现款则由花纱布公司直接支付合作社，由合作社直接向农民预购。新棉价格目前每斤标准皮棉以政务院规定之七斤小麦，支付粮食，或折价付款、付布。交棉期限最远不得迟过十月底，保证按数收回。其等级当以农民所交棉花质量升降，不使农民或公司互有吃亏，以求得公平合理。在交花时如棉花牌价已超过小麦七斤，当给群众按当时价格补偿；如棉价低于预购时之小麦七斤标准，则仍按原七斤计算，不再退款，以确实保障棉农利益。八月下旬省花纱布、粮食两公司及省合作社，已联合发出指示，着即进行预购。粮食、花纱布两公司已根据各地棉产情况，及群众需要情况，积极分别准备物资，以大力进行这一工作。同时省府亦发出指示：着各地政府确实领导督促这一工作的进行。
