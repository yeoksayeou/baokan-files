The Mao Zedong Locomotive (Serialized novella)
    Ding Kexin, Qing Ying

    XXX. As fast as possible
    Zheng Dugong kept his head down and worked hard. His comrades were surprised at where his mischievous energy had gone. They were waiting for an opportunity, and when it came, he would work even harder to show everyone.
    The opportunity finally arrived!
    On December 15th, the higher authorities gave the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" a new task – to test a new operational system.
    "This new operational system," driver Li Yong announced to everyone, "is a new method of train operation, also called the New Train Operation Method. – Guo Dache, Guo Dache, you can explain it more clearly than me, come on, you do it."
    The listeners laughed.
    "Old Hero is right," Guo Shude continued, "The new operational system is the New Train Operation Method. In the enemy and puppet era, the time and distance for running a train were fixed, and being a minute early or late was not allowed, which restricted workers from exerting their strength. The new operational system is much stronger. This is the new Soviet method of train operation. As long as the standard kilometer limit is not exceeded, workers can exert their strength as much as possible, and run as fast as possible."
    Shang Baoheng stepped forward and said:
    "Today I will also say a few words. – Because our Mao Zedong Locomotive is the leader of locomotives, the higher authorities asked us to test it first. This is really an honor, let's all work harder!"
    "Work harder!" "Complete the task!" people shouted.
    "But we need to pay attention to many new issues," Guo Shude continued.
    He explained in detail that the driver should personally check the water level in the water tank (Note 1), the fireman should thoroughly lubricate everything, etc.
    As soon as Guo Shude finished speaking, Old Saint jumped out!
    "I guarantee," he shouted, "Guo Dache and I guarantee: thorough lubrication without wear and tear; shorten the stopping time, and tidy up the firebed when arriving at the water supply station; also, never be late for the shift!"
    People applauded, and Guo Shude replied:
    "I guarantee to drive fast! Steadily! No delays! No accidents of responsibility! Maintain the speed when entering the station! Refueling will not exceed ten minutes!"
    The drivers and firemen of the other two shifts also immediately made mutual guarantees. They also added an important point:
    Under the principle of not taking risks, increase efforts to race against time (Note 2)!
    The competition heat surged to the factory, and the factory repair team also made a guarantee:
    "One repair, no accidents for four thousand kilometers!"
    Encountering accidents in the struggle, overcoming accidents! Encountering difficulties, solving difficulties! Look:
    Train 726, returning to Harbin from Wuchang Station, was in the middle of the night. Suddenly, a grate bar fell off. There was no one to repair it in Wuchang at night, and a delay would be a disaster. What to do?
    Zheng Dugong was sweating profusely and found Guo Shude.
    The two immediately crawled into the ash box, fixed the grate bar, and departed on time!
    Another time the locomotive's axle burned (Note 3), they quickly extinguished it with hard soda oil, stopping for seven minutes. Of the five water supply stations on the entire line, they only refueled twice, being confident. They drove back quickly without being late!
    On December 23rd, Lao Guo and Lao Zheng were running the train again, hauling 1239.5 tons, fully loaded (Note 4)! Departing from Yimianpo at 8:09, arriving in Harbin at 13:38, the total journey took 5 hours and 29 minutes, passing through twelve stations, refueling and meeting trains took 1 hour and 32 minutes, the actual running time was 3 hours and 57 minutes, equivalent to a technical speed of 41.8 kilometers, exceeding the bureau's standard by 3.3 kilometers.
    It was the highest record at the time!
    Old Hero's shift ran at a technical speed of 40.3 kilometers, exceeding the bureau's standard by 1.8!
    In this way, the entire team worked hard and tensely, and half a month passed quickly, saving more than a hundred minutes, and the new operational system was successfully tested!
    The higher authorities awarded 50,000 yuan.
    Everyone discussed it: they didn't want it!
    30,000 yuan to comfort the Railway Corps, and 20,000 yuan to buy car wiping cloths.
    This is nothing, keep up the efforts, and look at 1949!
    Note 1: Water level is the position of the water level in the boiler, which can be seen from the water gauge.
    Note 2: Sometimes trains are delayed, and to restore punctuality, they have to race against time; also, after the implementation of the new operational system, under the principle of not taking risks, in order to run more trains, they can race against time.
    Note 3: Axle box caught fire.
    Note 4: The train was fully loaded to the standard number. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作
    三十、能跑多快跑多快
    郑笃恭一直理头干，伙伴们都奇怪他的调皮劲儿不知哪去了？他们是在等机会，一有机会，他更要干给大伙看看。
    机会终于来了！
    十二月十五号，上级给了“毛泽东号”一个新任务——试验新运行制。
    “这新运行制啊，”司机长李永给大家传达：就是新的行车方法，又叫新行车法。——郭大车，郭大车，你说得比我清楚些，你来吧。”
    听的人都笑起来。
    “老英雄说得很对，”郭树德接上去讲道：“新运行制就是新行车法。敌伪时代行车，多少时间跑多少路是死的，迟一分早一分都不行，限制工人发挥力量。新运行制就强多啦。这是苏联的行车新方法，只要不超过标准公里最高限度，工人可以尽量发挥力量，能跑多快跑多快。”
    商宝恒抢上一步道：
    “今天我也讲几句。——因为咱们毛泽东号是机车领袖，所以上级先叫咱们试验，这一点可真光荣，大伙加油使劲吧？”
    “加油使劲！”“完成任务！”人们乱嚷。
    “可是要注意好多新问题。”郭树德继续讲。
    他把司机要亲自检查水柜水位（注一）啦，司炉要全部彻底给油啦等等详细讲了一遍。
    郭树德的话音刚落，老圣人早跳出来了！
    “我保证，”他嚷道：“我和郭大车保证：彻底给油不磨耗；缩短停车时间，到给水站就把火床整理好；还有，接班决不迟到！”
    人们鼓掌，郭树德回道：
    “我保证开车快！稳！不晚点！不出责任事故！保持进站速度！上水不超过十分钟！”
    其余两班的司机和司炉也马上互相保证起来。还加了重要的一条：
    在不冒险的原则下，加足气力竞赛抢点（注二）！
    竞赛热潮滚到了工厂，工厂包修组也提出保证：
    “包修一次，四千公里不出事故！”
    斗争中遭遇意外，克服意外！遭遇困难，解决困难！看吧：
    七二六次车，从五常站回哈尔滨，正半夜。忽然有一条炉条脱落了，在五常夜间没有人修，晚点就坏事，怎么办？
    郑笃恭急得满头大汗，找到郭树德。
    两个人立刻钻到灰箱里，把炉条整好，按点发车！
    又一次机车燃轴（注三），他们迅速用硬石碱油填灭，停车七分钟。全路五个给水站，他们只上两次水，有把握。飞快开回来，没有晚点！
    十二月二十三日，又赶上老郭、老郑他们跑车，牵引一二三九吨点五，满轴（注四）！八点九分一面坡发车，十三点三十八分到哈尔滨，共走行五点二十九分，通过十二站，上水会车停一点三十二分，实际运行时间是三点五十七分，合技术速度四十一点八公里，超过局定标准三点三公里。
    是当时最高纪录！
    老英雄那班，跑技术迅速四十点三公里，超过局定标准一点八！
    就这样，全车艰苦紧张，半个月匆匆过去，抢点一百多分钟，新运行制试验成功啦！
    上级奖励五万元。
    大家一讨论：都不要！
    三万元慰劳铁道兵团，两万元买了擦车布。
    这不算什么，再接再厉，看一九四九年的吧！
    注一：水位是锅炉中水位的位置，从水表上可以看出。
    注二；有时列车晚点，恢复正点时要抢点；再是实行新运行制后，在不冒险的原则下，为了多跑车，可以抢点。
    注三：轴箱燃烧失火。
    注四：列车载重满了标准数。（附图片）
