　　With the Strong Support of the Central People's Government
    Northern Anhui Fully Launches Production and Disaster Relief Work
    People in Disaster Areas Are Confident of Overcoming the Severe Famine
    [Our Newspaper] Production and disaster relief work in the disaster areas of northern Anhui has been fully launched. The necessary material assistance has been initially resolved with the strong support of the Central People's Government; and a "Temporary Command Headquarters for Production, Disaster Relief, and Huai River Management in Northern Anhui" has been established to unify command. Rescue work and replanting in the disaster areas of northern Anhui have been largely completed successfully. Specific plans have been made for autumn planting, Huai River management through work relief, and the development of side occupations, and these have successively begun to be implemented or are being prepared. Urgent problems to be solved, such as the protection of draught animals, fuel for disaster victims, winter clothing, edible salt, and strengthening medical epidemic prevention in disaster areas, are being addressed. The Central People's Government has principally agreed to all the material assistance needed for the above plans, and has already allocated a portion for reserve. The Central People's Government has also allocated an additional 100 million jin of grain as temporary mobile funds for purposes such as developing side occupations and dealing with draught animal problems. The various plans and urgent problems to be solved are as follows:
    (1) Autumn Planting Plan: Although replanting of late autumn crops has exceeded the plan, it is necessary to ensure a harvest after planting. Therefore, we should continue to carry out the movement to close breaches, restore embankments, and eliminate pests to protect the autumn crops. For sideline occupations in fields and gardens, each disaster area resident was mobilized to plant 1 fen of vegetables. With 10 million disaster victims, a total of 1 million mu of vegetables can be planted. Assuming a yield of 1,000 jin of vegetables per mu, a total of 100 million jin of grain can be obtained. Together with the replanted late autumn crops, it is estimated that a total of 600 million jin of grain can be solved for the disaster victims' food supply. In addition to the widespread planting of wheat, the autumn planting plan also proposes to plant more early-maturing crops to shorten the spring famine period next year. Huaibei strives to plant 70% of the total cultivated land; Huainan strives to plant 50% of the total cultivated land. According to this calculation, of the 31 million mu of affected land, efforts should be made to plant 22.5 million mu. A total of 160 million jin of wheat seeds are needed. The central government has already allocated 80 million jin first, and the remaining portion will be allocated successively by the East China Military and Political Committee based on actual conditions.
    (2) Huai River Management Through Work Relief: The entire northern Anhui region is preparing to mobilize 1 million full laborers and 1.5 million semi-laborers to start work in October. The grassroots cadres needed for the project have begun to train 3,000 river workers, and the tools needed for the project, such as shovels and light railway tracks, are being prepared. It is expected that the Huai River management project, combined with work relief, can help most disaster victims overcome the famine.
    (3) Sideline Production: Large-scale organization of sideline production with raw materials and sales channels; and promoting the sale of special products and purchasing local products; at the same time, in response to the needs of millions of migrant workers on the Huai River management project, such as the supply of necessities like oil, salt, grain, grass, reed mats, and reed bags, develop sideline occupations. Promotion of special products mainly focuses on oil pressing, grass cutting, mat weaving, basket weaving, hemp bag weaving, cattail bag weaving, and fishery production; the purchase of local products mainly focuses on kenaf, ramie, tobacco leaves, raw lacquer, and gallnuts. The total value of purchases is estimated to reach 200 billion yuan, requiring 50 billion yuan in trade funds. The entire sideline production can yield approximately 100 million to 150 million jin of grain.
    Urgent problems to be solved: (1) Protection of Draught Animals: Due to the general shortage of grass in disaster areas, many disaster victims no longer have the ability to raise cattle, so the situation of selling and slaughtering draught cattle is quite serious. According to estimates, there are approximately 700,000 draught cattle in the disaster areas. In addition to the disaster victims solving the majority of the problem themselves according to the measures for protecting draught cattle in disaster areas announced by the Northern Anhui Administrative Office last month, the government still needs to help solve the problem for approximately 200,000 head. To preserve livestock and ensure future agricultural production, the government plans to supply fodder, or purchase draught animals and lend them to non-disaster area people or institutions and troops for raising, requiring a total of approximately 54 million jin of grain. It has now been decided to purchase 1 million jin of alfalfa seeds from Shanxi as feed, which can solve most of the cattle feed problem. (2) Fuel Problem: After the flood, fuel is very scarce in disaster areas. The original plan was to borrow 520,000 tons of coal from the Central People's Government as a fuel subsidy. The central government has now allocated 100,000 tons first for emergency use. (3) Winter Clothing Problem: Winter is approaching in an instant. According to estimates, among the 7 million severely affected disaster victims, at least 5.8 million disaster victims have no winter clothing. In addition to the old clothes to be supplied from the nationwide clearing of warehouses and the collection of old clothes from various troops by the General Logistics Department of the Military Commission, the East China Production and Disaster Relief Committee has called on various cities to launch a movement to donate old clothes. Shanghai will be the first to respond; the Central Disaster Relief Committee has designated the China People's Relief Administration to organize a disaster victim winter clothing fundraising committee, which will launch a winter clothing fundraising movement in major cities across the country (excluding East China). (4) Medical Problem: The epidemic is prevalent in the disaster areas. The more than 500 medical teams and medicines sent from various places are not enough, and approximately three more medical teams and a large number of medicines are needed. The East China Military and Political Committee is now preparing to transfer medical personnel to the disaster areas for treatment. (5) Edible Salt Problem: The Central People's Government has agreed to allocate 10 million jin of relief salt, and has temporarily allocated 2 million jin first for emergency use.
    According to Zeng Xisheng, Secretary of the CPC Northern Anhui District Committee, who recently came to Beijing, the Northern Anhui Administrative Office's overall production and disaster relief budget for Northern Anhui is as follows: Since the flood occurred in mid-July, the Central People's Government has successively allocated 130 million jin of relief grain (more than 60 million jin has been distributed, and the rest will be distributed successively), which is expected to sustain the severely affected disaster victims from mid-July to the end of September. From October, the Huai River management project with work relief will begin; in addition, replanting late autumn and early-maturing crops can solve approximately 600 million jin of grain for the disaster victims' food supply; promoting the sale of special products and purchasing local products can produce approximately 100 million to 150 million jin of grain. It is expected that the above production income can solve the living problems of disaster victims in the entire region until March next year (spring plowing must be carried out in March, and most of the Huai River management project must be temporarily suspended). From March to the summer harvest, some disaster victims still need approximately 100 million jin of relief grain during this lean season. The Central People's Government has been requested to allocate another 200 million jin of grain at that time, with 100 million jin as relief grain and another 100 million jin as spring plowing production loans. According to the thorough implementation of this plan, the people of Northern Anhui are confident of overcoming the severe famine. The Northern Anhui Administrative Office has now put forward: (1) Guarantee that disaster victims will no longer move out to avoid increasing the difficulties of neighboring provinces; (2) Guarantee that no one will starve to death or freeze to death.

　　在中央人民政府大力支援下
    皖北全面展开生产救灾工作
    灾区人民有把握度过严重灾荒
    【本报讯】皖北灾区生产救灾工作已全面展开，所需各项物资援助，在中央人民政府的大力支援下已获得初步解决；并已成立“皖北生产救灾治淮临时指挥部”以便统一指挥。皖北灾区抢救工作和补种工作大体上已胜利完成。秋种工作，治淮工赈，发展副业等均已作出具体计划并已先后开始施行或进行准备工作。目前急待解决的问题如保护耕畜问题、灾民燃料问题、寒衣问题、食盐问题，加强灾区医疗防疫问题等，均正设法解决。以上各种计划所需物资援助，中央人民政府均已原则上同意，并已先拨给部分备用。中央人民政府并另拨给粮食一亿斤，作为临时机动应用款项，如开展副业、处理耕畜问题等。各项计划与急待解决问题如次：
    （一）秋种计划：补种晚秋虽已超额完成计划，但必须确保种后有收，因此应继续进行堵口复堤与灭虫保秋运动。田园副业，曾发动灾区每人种菜一分，一千万灾民计可种菜百万亩，每亩收菜一千斤计，共可得原粮一亿斤。加上已补种的晚秋作物，估计共可解决灾民口粮六亿斤。秋种计划，除普种小麦外，并拟多种早熟庄稼，以缩短明年春荒时间。淮北争取种到总耕地百分之七十；淮南争取种到总耕地百分之五十，按此计算受灾田三千一百万亩，应争取种到二千二百五十万亩。计共需麦种一亿六千万斤，现中央已先拨给八千万斤，其余部分由华东军政委员会斟酌实际情形再陆续拨给。
    （二）治淮工赈：皖北全区准备发动全劳动力一百万人，半劳动力一百五十万人，自十月份起开始动工，工程上所需之基层干部，已开始训练河工人员三千人，工程上所需之工具如铁锹、轻便铁道之铁轨等，均已进行准备。预计治淮工程结合以工代赈，可使大部分灾民度过灾荒。
    （三）副业生产：大量组织有原料有销路的副业生产；并推销特产，收购土产；同时针对治淮工程上数百万民工所需之必需品如油、盐、粮、草、芦席等物品供应，开展副业。推销特产方面，以打油、割草、编席、编筐、织麻袋、编蒲包以及渔业生产等为主；收购土产方面以魁麻、绒麻、烟叶、生漆、五倍子等为主，收购总值计可达二千亿元，计需贸易资金五百亿元。整个副业生产约可获原粮一亿到一亿五千万斤。
    目前急待解决之问题：（一）保护耕畜：由于灾区普遍缺草，灾民多已无养牛能力，故出卖与宰杀耕牛情形相当严重，据估计，灾区耕牛共约七十万头，除按照皖北行署月前公布的保护灾区耕牛办法由灾民自行解决大部分外，尚须政府帮助解决的约二十万头。为保存畜力，以保证今后农业生产，拟由政府供草料，或将耕畜购买贷给非灾区人民或机关、部队代养，计共需粮约五千四百万斤。现又决定向山西购买苜蓿种籽一百万斤，以作饲料，计可解决大部耕牛草料。（二）燃料问题：水灾之后，灾区燃料甚为缺乏。原计划向中央人民政府贷煤五十二万吨，作为补助燃料，现中央已先拨给十万吨济用。（三）寒衣问题：转瞬寒冬即至，据估计七百万重灾民中，至少有五百八十万灾民无寒衣，除将由全国清理仓库中之旧衣服及军委后勤部将向各部队收集旧衣服，供给部分外，华东生产救灾委员会已号召各城市展开捐献旧衣运动，上海即将首先响应；中央救灾委员会已指定中国人民救济总会，组织灾民寒衣募集委员会，将在全国各大城市（华东除外），发动募寒衣运动。（四）医药问题：灾区病疫流行，原由各地去的医疗队五百余人及药品均不敷应用，约再需三个医疗队及大批药品。华东军政委员会现正准备再抽调医务人员，前往灾区进行治疗工作。（五）食盐问题：中央人民政府已同意拨给救济盐一千万斤，暂先拨给二百万斤济用。
    据日前来京的中共皖北区党委书记曾希圣告记者：皖北行政公署对皖北总的生产救灾预算如次：从七月中旬水灾发生之后，中央人民政府已先后拨给救济粮一亿三千万斤（现已发放六千余万斤，其余将陆续发放），预计此数可使重灾民从七月中旬维持到九月底。十月份起即开始以工代赈的治淮工程；此外补种晚秋及早熟作物约可解决灾民口粮六亿斤；推销特产与收购土产约可生产原粮一亿到一亿五千万斤。预计以上各项生产收入，可解决全区灾民到明年三月的生活（到三月须进行春耕，治淮工程大部须暂时停工），三月以后直到夏收前，这段青黄不接时间有部分灾民尚需救济粮约一亿斤，已请中央人民政府到时再拨给两亿斤粮食，以一亿斤作救济粮，另一亿斤作春耕生产贷款。按此计划彻底施行，皖北人民是有把握度过严重灾荒的，现皖北行署已提出：（一）保证灾民不再外移，以免增加邻省困难；（二）保证不饿死人、不冻死人。
