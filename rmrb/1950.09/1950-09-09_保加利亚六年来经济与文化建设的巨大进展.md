Great Progress in Economic and Cultural Construction of Bulgaria in the Past Six Years
　　Chen Di Hu Sisheng
　　September 9th marks the sixth anniversary of the liberation of Bulgaria. Six years ago today, on September 9, 1944, Soviet troops liberated Bulgaria from the long-term enslavement of German invaders and the domestic fascist regime, helped the Bulgarian people establish the first government of their own, and with selfless assistance, enabled Bulgaria's devastated national economy at the time of liberation to quickly embark on the road to recovery and development.

　　After liberation, the Bulgarian People's Government implemented a series of democratic reforms domestically, such as controlling private capital and confiscating the enterprises and properties of war criminals and traitors. These measures ensured the overcoming of economic difficulties. At the end of 1947, the Bulgarian National Assembly passed laws on the nationalization of large and medium-sized enterprises and mining industries, and the nationalization of banks. According to these two laws, 5,552 enterprises were nationalized, and the national banking business was completely monopolized by the state. After the nationalization of enterprises, the production volume of state-owned industrial sectors accounted for 93 percent of the national industrial production (in 1946, private capital still accounted for 83.6 percent of the national industrial production), thus laying a solid foundation for the development of the socialist economy.

　　In agriculture, as a result of the land reform, 128,825 landless and land-poor farmers obtained 150,000 hectares of land. State-owned farms, machine and tractor stations, and agricultural production cooperatives also began to be established. In the autumn of 1946, the number of agricultural production cooperatives had increased from 110 at the end of 1944 to 451; the number of participating households increased from 7,238 to 43,400; and the land owned increased from 25,680 hectares to 192,900 hectares.

　　Due to the government's enormous reforms in the economic field and the working class's selfless labor, by the end of 1946, Bulgaria had not only recovered from the ravages of war but also brought industrial production to pre-war levels, and agricultural production also recovered rapidly.

　　These preliminary achievements created favorable conditions for the implementation of Bulgaria's first national economic plan in history—the two-year national economic plan from 1947 to 1948. It was originally stipulated that by the time the two-year plan was completed, the total industrial output should increase by 67 percent compared with 1939. Although in 1947, due to terrible droughts and sabotage by private capitalists, only 85.4 percent of the plan was completed. But in 1948, industrial production increased by 44 percent compared with 1947, so that by the time the two-year plan was completed, Bulgaria's total industrial production had exceeded the pre-war level by 71.5 percent; the production volume of individual industrial sectors increased even more, such as electricity production, which increased by 209.8 percent compared with 1939. Great progress has also been made in agricultural production, with the sown area increasing by 53,100 hectares compared to the previous period. It was originally planned to establish 800 agricultural production cooperatives, but by the time the plan was completed, more than 1,000 had been developed.

　　The successful completion of the two-year plan laid the foundation for Bulgaria's rapid industrialization and the start of the five-year national economic plan. The five-year plan stipulates that by 1953, Bulgaria's industrial production will increase by 119 percent compared with 1948. The production of heavy industry will achieve even greater development, with the production of machinery and equipment and transportation tools increasing by 480 percent compared with 1948, and 64 times compared with 1939. The output of coal, iron, lead and other metals will also increase several times compared with 1948. In agriculture, it is stipulated that the output of crops should increase by 62 percent compared with the pre-war period, and the number of livestock breeding should increase by 44 percent. The number of participants in agricultural production cooperatives will include 60 percent of the basic peasant masses. The number of tractors will increase to 10,000.

　　The results of the implementation of the first year of the five-year plan—the 1949 national economic plan—show that industrial production exceeded the original plan by 7 percent, and increased by 30 percent compared with 1948. The labor productivity of various industrial sectors increased by 5 to 19 percent. Agricultural production cooperatives increased by 500 compared with 1948, and cultivated nearly 2.5 million decares of land (equivalent to 3.8 million mu).

　　The overfulfillment of the 1949 economic plan ensured the further expansion and consolidation of the socialist part of the national economy. The socialist part has accounted for 60 percent of the national income, 99 percent of industrial production, and 86 percent of trade.

　　According to the decision of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers, the tasks of the 1950 national economic plan have the following increases in percentage compared with 1949:

　　National Income 29.8%
　　Heavy Industrial Production 16.3%
　　Agriculture 40.5%
　　Cotton Fabrics 30%
　　Wool Fabrics 48.2%
　　Shoes 66.2%
　　State-owned and Cooperative Trade 23.3%
　　Meat Sales 17.5%
　　Lard 260%

　　The 1950 economic plan is being implemented victoriously. The production bulletins for the first and second quarters published by the State Planning Commission indicate that the plan for the first half of the year has been completed. Compared with the same period last year, industrial production increased by 22.35 percent, retail trade volume increased by 25.5 percent, and sowing has also exceeded the plan. The achievements of the machine-building industry are particularly outstanding. In the second quarter, the production of tractor-drawn seeders doubled, and the production of electrical equipment increased by 50 percent.

　　The success of the two-year plan and the smooth implementation of the five-year plan have enabled Bulgaria to make tremendous progress not only in industry, thus laying a preliminary foundation for national industrialization and electrification, but also to make great improvements in agriculture. First of all, the development of agricultural production cooperatives should be pointed out. In 1944, there were only 110 agricultural production cooperatives, with more than 7,000 members and only 25,680 hectares of cultivated land. At present, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has increased to 1,795, with more than 228,600 participating members. The degree of agricultural mechanization is also increasing. To date, there are 95 machine and tractor stations (only 71 at the beginning of 1949), with a total of more than 6,000 tractors.

　　The tremendous achievements Bulgaria has made in construction are inseparable from the direct assistance of the Soviet Union. In 1947, the Soviet Union and Bulgaria signed an agreement, under which the Soviet Union supplied Bulgaria with industrial raw materials and equipment and provided technical assistance. In the same year, the Soviet Union and Bulgaria signed a barter agreement, under which Bulgaria exchanged agricultural products for Soviet machinery and industrial raw materials. The supply of Soviet industrial raw materials and machinery helped Bulgaria to successfully complete the two-year plan and begin the implementation of the five-year plan.

　　The smooth progress of economic construction has ensured the consolidation of the national financial system and improved the living standards of the working people. Bulgaria's national budget for 1950 totaled 207.252 billion leva (Bulgarian currency, about 290 leva equals one US dollar), with income exceeding expenditure by 9.234 billion leva. The main source of national income, 70.4 percent, comes from the state-owned economy; as for the taxes paid by the people, they only account for 10.8 percent of the total income.

　　Bulgaria's peaceful policy of developing economic construction and increasing the welfare of the people is clearly reflected in the allocation of budget expenditures. 34.3 percent of all budget expenditures are used for economic construction, and 30.6 percent are used for social welfare and cultural undertakings, while expenditures for national defense purposes only account for 7 percent of the total expenditure.

　　Thanks to the constant care and concern of the Party and the government, the living standards of the working people have been significantly improved. The phenomena of unemployment and hunger have long been eliminated in Bulgaria. The rapid development of industry has greatly increased the need for labor. In 1949, the number of industrial and agricultural workers increased by 81,000. In 1950, 87,600 people will be added to the entire national economic undertaking. Workers' wages have been increased. After the completion of the two-year plan, the total wages increased by 29.9 percent, and in 1949, they increased by another 9.7 percent. In the first quarter of this year, the total wages increased by 18 percent, and in the industrial sector, they increased by 23 percent. By 1953, the total wages in the industrial sector will increase by 64 percent. Tens of thousands of workers have gained the opportunity to rest and recuperate; the supply of food, clothing and other consumer goods is increasing day by day.

　　Cultural and educational undertakings are also developing rapidly. Schools that only a few bourgeois children could enter in the past are now open to the vast number of workers' and peasants' children. The number of primary schools has increased from 7,161 before 1944 to 8,958, middle schools have increased from 134 to 262, and institutions of higher learning have increased from 8 to 10. In 1944, only 12,000 students received higher education, and now there are 39,000 students in higher education. In order to eliminate illiteracy, spare-time schools have been vigorously developed. There are now 31 night schools and 120 junior night schools. There is one student for every 180 citizens in Bulgaria.

　　Bulgaria's development path over the past six years fully demonstrates the superiority of the people's democratic system that exercises the functions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the correct leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and with the friendly assistance of the great Soviet Union, Bulgaria is moving towards the path of socialism. More than 6.14 million of Bulgaria's 7 million people have solemnly signed the Stockholm Peace Appeal. In the powerful world peace and democracy camp, Bulgaria has become an important member. The Bulgarian people, who have achieved great achievements in the construction of their motherland, are today defending their motherland and world peace with full confidence, tireless labor and powerful strength.

　　保加利亚六年来经济与文化建设的巨大进展
    陈涤　胡思升
    九月九日，是保加利亚解放六周年纪念日。六年前的今天，一九四四年九月九日，苏联军队把保加利亚从德国侵略者和国内法西斯政权的长期奴役中解放出来，帮助保加利亚人民建立第一个人民自己的政府，并且以大公无私的援助，使保加利亚刚刚解放时的残破不堪的国民经济，迅速地走上了恢复与发展的道路。
    在解放后，保加利亚人民政府在国内实行了一系列的民主改革，如节制私人资本，没收战犯、卖国贼的企业、财产等。这些措施保证了经济困难的克服。一九四七年底，保加利亚国民议会通过了大、中型企业与矿业国有化和银行国有化的法案。根据这两个法案，五千五百五十二个企业被收归国有，全国的银行业务完全由国家专营。在企业国有化之后，国营工业部门的生产量占有全国工业生产量的百分之九十三（在一九四六年时，私人资本还占全国工业生产的百分之八十三点六），因而奠定了社会主义经济发展的稳固基础。
    在农业方面，由于实行土地改革的结果，十二万八千八百二十五户无地与少地的农民获得了十五万公顷的土地。国营农场、机器与拖拉机站、农业生产合作社也开始建立起来。在一九四六年秋季，农业生产合作社就已由一九四四年底的一百十个增至四百五十一个；参加人数由七千二百三十八户增至四万三千四百户；所拥有的土地则由二万五千六百八十公顷增至十九万二千九百公顷。
    由于政府在经济方面所采取的巨大改革与工人阶级的忘我劳动，在一九四六年底时，保加利亚不但恢复了战争的创伤，而且使工业生产量达到了战前的水平，农业生产也很迅速地恢复起来。
    这一切初步的成就，为实行保加利亚历史上第一个国民经济计划—一九四七年到一九四八年两年国民经济计划创造了有利的条件。原来规定在两年计划完成时工业的总生产量应较一九三九年增加百分之六十七。虽然在一九四七年，由于可怕的旱灾与私人资本家的怠工，而只完成了计划的百分之八十五点四。但在一九四八年，工业生产量却较一九四七年增加了百分之四十四，因而在两年计划完成时，保加利亚的工业总生产量已超过了战前水平的百分之七十一点五；个别工业部门生产量增加得更多，如电力生产，比一九三九年增加了百分之二○九点八。农业生产方面也获得了极大的进展，播种面积较前增加了五万三千一百公顷。原来预定要建立八百个农业生产合作社，到计划完成时则已发展到一千个以上了。
    两年计划的胜利完成，奠定了保加利亚迅速工业化与着手进行五年国民经济计划的基础。五年计划规定：到一九五三年时，保加利亚的工业生产量将比一九四八年增加百分之一百一十九。重工业生产则将获得更大的发展，机器设备与运输工具的生产要较一九四八年增加百分之四百八十，较一九三九年增加六十四倍。煤、铁、铅及其他金属的产量也将较一九四八年增加数倍。在农业方面规定：农作物的产量要比战前增加百分之六十二，牲畜繁殖数增加百分之四十四。而农业生产合作社的参加人数将包括百分之六十的基本农民群众。拖拉机将增加至一万架。
    五年计划的第一年——一九四九年国民经济计划执行的结果，工业生产量超过了原计划的百分之七，而较一九四八年增加了百分之三十。工业各部门的劳动生产率则提高了百分之五至十九。农业生产合作社较一九四八年增加了五百个，多耕了将近二百五十万狄卡尔土地（合三百八十万市亩）。
    一九四九年经济计划的超额完成，保证了国民经济中社会主义部分的进一步扩大与巩固。社会主义部分在国民收入中已占百分之六十，在工业生产中已占百分之九十九，在贸易中已占百分之八十六。
    根据保加利亚部长会议的决定，一九五○年国民经济计划的任务，按百分比与一九四九年比较有如下的增加：
    国家收入  二九点八％
    重工业生产量  一六点三％
    农业  四○点五％
    棉织品  三○％
    毛织品  四八点二％
    鞋靴  六六点二％
    国营和合作社贸易  二三点三％
    肉类出售  一七点五％
    猪油    二六○％
    一九五○年的经济计划正在胜利地执行着。国家计划委员会所发表的第一季、第二季生产公报指明：上半年的计划业已完成。与去年同期比较，工业生产量增加了百分之二十二点三五，零售贸易量增加了百分之二十五点五，播种亦已超过了计划。机器制造工业的成绩特别优异，在第二季中以拖拉机曳引的条播机的生产增加了一倍，电工器材的生产增加了百分之五十。
    两年计划的成功与五年计划的顺利执行使保加利亚不但在工业方面获得了十分巨大的进展，因而奠定了国家工业化与电气化的初步基础，而且在农业方面也有了很大的改善。首先应该指出的是农业生产合作社的发展。一九四四年，农业生产合作社仅一一○个，社员七千余户，拥有耕地仅二五六八○公顷。目前，全国农业生产合作社的数目又增至一千七百九十五个，参加社员已达二十二万八千六百多户。农业机械化的程度也在增加着。迄今全国已有九十五个机器与拖拉机站（一九四九年初仅七十一个），共有拖拉机六千余架。
    保加利亚在建设上获得的巨大成就，是和苏联的直接的援助分不开的。一九四七年苏保签订协定，苏联以工业原料和设备供给保加利亚，并在技术上予以援助。同年苏保又签订了换货协定，保加利亚以农产品换得苏联的机器和工业原料。苏联工业原料和机器的供给帮助了保加利亚顺利地完成了二年计划和开始实行了五年计划。
    经济建设的顺利进展，保证了国家财政制度的巩固，并提高了劳动人民的生活水平。保加利亚一九五○年度的国家预算总额为二千零七十二亿五千二百万利瓦（保币，约二百九十利瓦合一美元），收入超过支出达九十二亿三千四百万利瓦。国家收入的主要来源，百分之七十点四是来自国营经济；至于人民缴纳的赋税仅占总收入的百分之十点八。
    保加利亚为了发展经济建设，增进人民福利而采取的和平政策，明显地表现在预算支出的分配额中，全部预算支出的百分之三十四点三用于经济建设，百分之三十点六，则用于社会福利与文化事业方面，用于国防目的的支出仅占全部支出的百分之七。
    由于党与政府的经常的照顾和关怀，劳动人民的生活水平已有显著的提高。失业与饥饿的现象早就在保加利亚消灭了。工业的迅速发展，使劳动力的需要大大地增加。一九四九年，工业与农业工人的数目增加了八万一千人。一九五○年在整个国民经济事业中，将增加八万七千六百人。工人的工资业已提高，两年计划完成后，工资总数增加了百分之二十九点九，一九四九年则又增加了百分之九点七。今年第一季内工资总额共增加了百分之十八，在工业部门内则增加了百分之二十三，到一九五三年，工资总额在工业部门内将增加百分之六十四。成千成万的工人获得了休息与疗养的机会；食品、衣着等消费品的供给量日益增加着。
    文教事业也有着迅速的发展。以前只有少数资产阶级的儿女才能进去的学校，今天已为广大的工农子女打开了大门。小学的数目由一九四四年以前的七一六一所增至八九五八所，中学校由一三四所增至二六二所，高等学校则由八所增至十所。在一九四四年只有一万二千名学生受着高等教育，现在高等教育方面已有三万九千名学生。为了要扫除文盲，业余学校已大力地发展起来。现在有着三十一个夜校与一百二十个初级夜校。保加利亚每一百八十个公民中，就有一个学生。
    保加利亚六年来的发展道路，充分地证明了执行着无产阶级专政职权的人民民主制度的优越性。在保加利亚共产党的正确领导和伟大苏联的友谊帮助之下，保加利亚正向着社会主义的道路迈进。保加利亚全国七百万人口中，已有六百一十四万余人庄严地在斯德哥尔摩和平宣言上签了名。在强大的世界和平民主阵营中，保加利亚已成为重要的一员。在祖国建设中获得伟大成就的保加利亚人民，今天正满怀信心、以不倦的劳动和强大的力量捍卫着祖国，捍卫着世界和平。
