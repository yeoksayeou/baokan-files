Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 16th. The Guangzhou Municipal People's Government will build two monuments in the city's Sha Ji and the northern suburb of Sanyuanli to commemorate the Guangdong people's martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves in the anti-imperialist struggle. The monument to be built in Sha Ji will have the inscription: "Eternal Glory to the Martyrs Who Sacrificed in the Guangdong People's Anti-Imperialist Struggle on June 23, 1925." The front of the monument will be inlaid with a bronze painting depicting the anti-imperialist upsurge of the Guangzhou people in that year. The monument to be built in Sanyuanli will be inscribed: "In Memory of the Martyrs Who Sacrificed in the Anti-British Imperialist Struggle in 1841."

The Sha Ji Anti-Imperialist Monument commemorates the martyrs who died in the Sha Ji Massacre. On June 23, 1925, the Guangdong people held a demonstration to protest the atrocities of the British imperialists in Shanghai on May 30 of the same year and subsequently in Hankou, where they massacred our patriotic people. When the marching crowd passed through Sha Ji (now "June 23rd Road"), the British troops in the Shamian British Concession and the American, French, and Portuguese warships on the Pearl River fired on the marching crowd, resulting in the death of 52 Chinese people and the injury of more than 170. This massacre aroused great indignation among the people of our country. The Guangdong Revolutionary Government at the time announced the implementation of an economic boycott against Britain, blockading the harbor. More than 100,000 Chinese workers in Hong Kong, who were on an anti-imperialist strike, all returned to the mainland and persisted in the strike struggle for 18 months, turning Hong Kong into a dead port for a time.

The Sanyuanli "Anti-Imperialist Monument" commemorates the patriotic actions of the people of Sanyuanli, Guangzhou, who armed themselves to resist the British imperialist aggression during the Opium War. On May 30, 1841, more than 1,000 British invading troops who had invaded Chinese territory plundered Guangzhou city, arousing a patriotic upsurge among local residents. When the British troops passed through Sanyuanli, nearby villagers beat gongs and drums to organize the Pingying Regiment to resist, killing more than 100 British invading officers and soldiers.

　　纪念在反帝斗争中牺牲的烈士
    广州将建立两座纪念碑
    【新华社广州十六日电】广州市人民政府为纪念在反帝国主义斗争中光荣牺牲的广东人民烈士，将于市区沙基及北郊三元里各建纪念碑一座。建立在沙基的纪念碑，上刻碑文说：“一九二五年六月二十三日广东人民反帝国主义斗争中牺牲烈士们永垂不朽。”该碑的正面嵌有描绘当年广州人民反帝国主义怒潮的铜画一幅。建立在三元里的纪念碑上刻：“一八四一年反英帝国主义斗争中牺牲烈士纪念。”
    沙基反帝国主义纪念碑是纪念沙基惨案中牺牲的烈士。一九二五年六月二十三日，广东人民举行抗议英帝国主义者同年五月三十日在上海以及接着在汉口屠杀我国爱国人民的暴行的示威游行。当游行队伍路经沙基（即现在的“六二三路”）时，沙面英租界的英国军队及珠江江面的美、法、葡等国军舰竟对游行队伍射击，以致我国人民死五十二人，伤一百七十多人。这一惨案引起我全国人民极大愤慨。当时的广东革命政府宣布实行对英经济绝交，封锁海口。正在举行反帝国主义罢工的香港十余万中国工人全部回国，坚持了十八个月的罢工斗争，使香港一时变为死港。
    三元里“反帝国主义纪念碑”纪念鸦片战争期间广州三元里人民的武装抵抗英国帝国主义侵略的爱国行动。一八四一年五月三十日，侵入中国领土的英国侵略军千余人在广州城外大肆掳掠，激起当地居民的爱国怒潮。当英军经过三元里时，附近村民鸣锣打鼓组织平英团反抗，击毙英国侵略军官兵百余人。
