　　Taiwan is Chinese Territory, and No Encroachment by American Aggressors Will Be Tolerated!
　　Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League
　　U.S. President Truman issued an aggressive statement on June 27th, announcing the U.S. government's decision to use force to prevent the liberation of Taiwan while interfering in the Korean civil war. He also sent his naval and air forces to invade Taiwan, claiming that "the determination of Taiwan's future status must await the restoration of security in the Pacific, the conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan, or consideration by the United Nations." Recently, on September 1st, Truman openly asserted in a speech that Taiwan is a "disputed territory," saying that Taiwan's future should be decided by "international action." In reality, the American aggressors have already turned Taiwan into their base of aggression. The U.S. Seventh Fleet is permanently stationed there, the U.S. Thirteenth Air Force has established a base there, and the U.S. military mission, the so-called "U.S. Far East Military Survey Group," is manipulating everything in Taiwan. Many U.S. companies have become the masters of Taiwan's economy. All of this is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, interference in our internal affairs, and an imperialist act of aggression that undermines our national territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence.
　　In the early 7th century AD, and even as far back as the 3rd century BC, people from mainland China successively crossed the sea to Taiwan and cultivated the land there. At that time, Taiwan only had a very small number of indigenous Gaoshan people, who had not yet belonged to any country's territory. In 605 AD, after Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty unified mainland China, he engaged in trade activities with Taiwan, Penghu, and other islands and launched two expeditions to Taiwan. During the Tang and Song dynasties, more and more people from the mainland came to Taiwan, engaging in commerce or settling there. By the Song Dynasty, the fertile fields in western Taiwan had been developed by the Han people. In 1297, the Yuan Dynasty established a patrol commissioner in Penghu, under the jurisdiction of Tong'an County, Fujian.
　　In the early 17th century, the Netherlands and Spain invaded Taiwan, occupying a part of Taiwan, but the Han people resisted these aggressors. In 1661, Zheng Chenggong led about 30,000 troops from Fujian to Taiwan, overthrowing the Dutch colonial rule. He established a Chinese regime in Taiwan, setting up "Chengtain Prefecture" and the two counties of "Tianxing" and "Wannian." He also implemented the "military reclamation system," using troops to cultivate the land, establish a land system, revitalize agriculture, and develop various industries.
　　After the late Ming Dynasty, the people of Taiwan Province launched continuous armed struggles to oppose the Manchu rule in China. They marched into mainland China several times, severely hitting the Manchu Qing rule and becoming the most important force in the national struggle of the Han people against the Manchu Qing rule at that time. At that time, Han people on the mainland who were dissatisfied with the Manchu Qing rulers also moved to Taiwan, and Taiwan became the last stronghold of the Han regime in the late Ming Dynasty. Therefore, today, all the people of Taiwan Province admire Zheng Chenggong and regard him as the "founding ancestor."
　　The Manchu Qing government entered Taiwan in 1683, unified China, and in 1684 established Taiwan Prefecture in Taiwan, under which were Tainan, Zhuluo (now Chiayi), and Fengshan counties. The scope of rule was even wider than during Zheng's time. The Han people gradually expanded their reclamation areas from south to north and from west to east, eventually reaching the entire island. In 1887, Taiwan was established as a province, with prefectures set up in the north, central, and south, and counties and sub-prefectures under the prefectures. Taitung Subordinate Prefecture was established in the east. At the same time, railways were laid, and industries were revitalized. At this time, although Taiwan was a province of China and could live together with compatriots throughout the country, the people of Taiwan Province, like compatriots throughout the country, were always dissatisfied with foreign rule and launched successive national struggles to "oppose the Qing and restore the Ming."
　　In 1895, when the Japanese imperialists seized Taiwan, the people of Taiwan Province, although they knew that the Manchu Qing government had already succumbed to the Japanese invaders, did not forget that they were Chinese people and were unwilling to leave their motherland and be ruled by Japan. They finally resolutely rose up and swore, "We would rather everyone die in battle and lose Taiwan than hand it over with folded hands!". Volunteer armies rose up everywhere, attacking the Japanese army with crude weapons, and fought fiercely in various parts of the province for more than five months. Although this war of resistance suffered great sacrifices and failed, the people of Taiwan Province were never subdued by the Japanese invaders' bloody rule and did not forget that they were Chinese.
　　During the 51 years of Japanese rule, the people of Taiwan Province launched more than 40 armed resistances and constantly resisted the various enslavement policies of the Japanese imperialists in military, political, economic, and cultural affairs. They opposed imperialist aggression and strived for the restoration of Taiwan, constantly promoting the patriotic spirit of the people of Taiwan Province and encouraging resolute struggles against the enemy. From the Lin Da-bei (the leader of the said uprising) anti-Japanese uprising in the winter of 1895 to the anti-Japanese patriots who were killed and arrested in 1902, there were more than 11,500 people.
　　After the overthrow of the Manchu Qing rule in the country, armed uprisings such as the Lin-p'u incident (belonging to Taichung County, now Zhushan), the T'u-k'u uprising, and the Miaoli incident occurred in Taiwan in 1912. In 1915, anti-Japanese patriots led by Yu Qingfang launched an anti-Japanese struggle, which lasted for more than ten months of bloody battle, and finally suffered inhumane massacres. In one public trial, more than 3,200 residents of more than 20 villages were collectively massacred, with no one spared, old or young. This incident is the Xilai'an incident (i.e., the Jiaobaonian Massacre), which is still engraved in the minds of the people of Taiwan Province. In 1930, the Gaoshan people fought against the Japanese army for more than a month, namely the Wushe incident, in which the Japanese army used airplanes to spread poisonous gas all over the mountains and fields, causing extremely heavy deaths among the tribe.
　　The people of Taiwan Province not only spared no expense for the freedom of the nation, carrying out bloody struggles one after another, but also resolutely opposed the Japanese invaders' "assimilation policy," opposed its strict prohibition of the use of Chinese language, and refused to intermarry with the Japanese in order to maintain the purity of the national bloodline. They also engraved place names such as "Tong'an" and "Longxi" on the cornerstones of their ancestors to show that they were Chinese people. For a long time, the people of Taiwan Province have been keenly concerned about the revolutionary movement of the people of the motherland, rejoicing at victory and worrying about defeat. Many young people went through all kinds of hardships and returned to the motherland to devote themselves to the revolution.
　　Under the resolute opposition of the people of the motherland to the Japanese imperialists' aggression, the Cairo Declaration of 1943 and the Potsdam Declaration of 1945 finally determined that Taiwan would be returned to China. At that time, the people of Taiwan Province, who were under the iron heel of Japanese militarists, were overjoyed when they heard this news, telling each other that they could get rid of the slave life under foreign rule for 50 years and return to the embrace of the motherland. After Japan surrendered in the autumn of 1945, the people of Taiwan Province finally achieved their long-cherished wish and returned to the motherland. The people of Taiwan Province celebrated the return of Taiwan to the motherland with unparalleled enthusiasm and welcomed the arrival of compatriots from the mainland and the regime and army of the motherland. Although later facts proved that the people of Taiwan Province mistakenly regarded the Kuomintang reactionary government as representing the regime of the people of the motherland, the fact that the people of the entire province supported the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations and supported the return to the motherland is absolutely undeniable.
　　The dregs of China, the Kuomintang reactionaries, implemented brutal exploitation and oppression of the people of Taiwan Province, which aroused resolute resistance from the people of the entire province. The uprising of the people of the entire province on February 28, 1947, was the largest of these. In this struggle, the people of Taiwan Province carried out an incomparably heroic struggle against the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The people of the entire province cooperated with the patriotic and democratic revolution of the motherland, demanding an end to the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries and obtaining democracy and freedom together with the people of the whole country.
　　For thousands of years, the Han people, with their unparalleled courage and industrious spirit, have used their blood and sweat to reclaim Taiwan, defend Taiwan, and build Taiwan, turning this barren island into their beautiful home and sacred territory. In order to resist aggressors and oppressors, the people of Taiwan Province have carried out long and heroic struggles, promoting the excellent tradition of the Chinese nation's heroic and unyielding spirit and strong patriotism. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the people of Taiwan are the people of China. We, the people of Taiwan, have always demanded to return to the embrace of the motherland, live together with compatriots in the motherland, and oppose any artificial separation. This is an ironclad fact that cannot be denied by anyone, nor can it be changed by any force. Especially today, when the mainland of the country has been basically liberated, the people of the motherland have their own regime, and they have begun to enjoy a good life, the desire of the people of Taiwan Province to return to the motherland is even more urgent, and their will is even more firm, which cannot be distorted or stopped by the lies and threats of Truman and the like.
　　The Chinese people, especially the people of Taiwan Province, know very well that since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits have taken over the marrow and blood that the Japanese invaders had extracted and plundered from the people of Taiwan Province for half a century—most of the land and enterprises—and fattened themselves, while the American imperialists, through the support of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, have implemented the exploitation of the people of Taiwan Province, resulting in the unprecedented tragic situation in the lives of the people of the entire province today. We know that from the first day that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits took over Taiwan, the American imperialists wanted to realize their plan to turn Taiwan into their colony, on the one hand instigating traitors to advocate "trusteeship" and "independence," and on the other hand using the traitorous nature of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to gradually realize their goal of directly ruling Taiwan Province. This time, Truman's statement on June 27th was nothing more than exposing and further acting on his original conspiracy to invade Taiwan. The American imperialists' sending their naval and air forces to invade Taiwan, attempting to use force to prevent us from liberating Taiwan, is not only a direct infringement on our territorial sovereignty, endangering the interests of the people of the whole country, especially the people of Taiwan Province, and a heinous act of completely undermining the United Nations Charter, but also an attempt to further realize their conspiracy to invade and occupy our Taiwan Province. The Chinese people, especially the people of Taiwan Province, have the right to demand that the U.S. government must immediately withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan, and step up efforts to support the liberation of Taiwan, and smash the ambitions and conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to invade.
　　The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League represents the will and aspirations of the entire people of Taiwan Province, and firmly supports the statements and protests made by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on several occasions regarding the U.S. government's aggression against Taiwan. With unparalleled indignation, the people of Taiwan Province vow to step up their unity and fight to the end against American aggression, to eliminate the reactionary rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, and to strive for the early liberation of Taiwan.

　　台湾是中国的领土，决不容美国侵略者染指！
    台湾民主自治同盟主席  谢雪红
    美国总统杜鲁门在六月二十七日发表侵略声明，宣布干涉朝鲜内战同时，并宣布美国政府决以武力阻止我台湾的解放，并出动它的海空军侵入台湾，认为“台湾未来地位的决定，必须等待太平洋安全的恢复，对日和约的缔结，或联合国的考虑”。最近，九月一日，杜鲁门在演说中公然认为台湾是“争议的领土”，说台湾的将来应由“国际行动”来决定。实际上，美国侵略者已把台湾变为其侵略基地，美国第七舰队已经常驻扎那里，美国第十三航空队已在那里建立了基地，而美国的军事使团，即所谓“美国远东军事考察团”，正在台湾操纵一切，许多美国公司成了台湾经济的主宰。所有这一切，都是横暴地违反联合国宪章，干涉我国内政，破坏我国领土完整主权独立的帝国主义侵略行为。
    在公元七世纪初，甚至可以远推到纪元前三世纪，中国大陆人民已陆续渡海到台湾，在那里垦殖。那时，台湾只有极少数的先住民高山族，还未归属任何一个国家的版图。公元六零五年，隋炀帝统一中国大陆后，曾与台湾、澎湖等岛展开贸易活动，远征过台湾二次。唐、宋两代，大陆人民往来台湾，经商或移居台湾者更众。至宋代，台湾西部一带沃野，已为汉族人民所开拓。到一二九七年，元朝在澎湖设巡按使，属福建同安县。
    十七世纪初，荷兰、西班牙曾侵入台湾，占领了台湾一部分地区，但汉族人民即与这些侵略者进行了反抗斗争。一六六一年郑成功率领约三万军队，自福建进军台湾，推翻了荷兰的殖民统治，乃在台湾建立了中国的政权，设“承天府”与“天兴”、“万年”二县，并且实行“屯田制”，以军队来垦殖，确立土地制度，振兴农业和发展各种产业。
    明末以后，台湾省人民为反对满族统治中国，曾不断地展开了武装斗争，几次进军中国大陆，给满清统治以严重的打击，而成为当时汉族人民反抗满清统治的民族斗争中最重要的一股力量。当时，大陆上汉族人民不满满清统治者亦纷纷迁居台湾，台湾曾成为明末汉族政权的最后堡垒。所以，今天全台湾省人民都崇拜郑成功，奉为“开山祖”。
    满清政府于一六八三年进入台湾，统一全中国，一六八四年即在台湾设立台湾府，下设台南、诸罗（现在的嘉义）、凤山三县，统治范围较郑氏时期更扩大。而汉族人民更由南而北，由西而东逐渐扩张垦殖区，终及于全台。至一八八七年台湾建省，在北、中、南各设府，府下设县、厅，于东部设台东直隶州；同时，敷设铁路，振兴实业。此时台湾虽是中国的一省而与全国同胞能够生活在一起，但台湾省人民亦与全国同胞一样，始终不满于异族统治，也展开过了前仆后继的“反清复明”的民族斗争。
    一八九五年，日本帝国主义者夺取台湾的时候，台湾省人民虽知当时满清政府已经向日寇屈服，但却未忘自己是中国人民，决不愿意离开祖国而受日本的统治，终于毅然地起来，宣誓“愿人人战死而失台，决不愿拱手而让台！”。各地义军蜂起，以简陋的武器袭击日军，在全省各地激战了五个多月。这次抗战虽然遭到了很大的牺牲而失败，但台湾省人民始终没有被日寇的血腥统治所屈服，而忘掉自己是中国人。
    在日寇统治五十一年间，我台湾省人民展开了四十多次的武装反抗，并不断抵抗日本帝国主义者军事、政治、经济和文化的种种奴役政策，反对帝国主义侵略与争取光复台湾，不断地发扬台湾省人民的爱国主义精神和鼓动坚决折敌的斗争。自一八九五年冬的林大北（该次暴动的领导者）抗日暴动，到一九零二年被杀被捕的抗日志士，就达一万一千五百多人。
    在国内推翻了满清统治后，台湾于一九一二年就发生了林圮埔（属台中县，即现在的竹山）事件、土库起义和苗栗事件等武装暴动。到一九一五年以余清芳为首的抗日志士又展开了反日斗争，延续了十个多月的血战，终于遭受非人道的大惨杀，在一次的公审里即有二十多村落居民三千二百余人被集体屠杀，老幼无一幸免。这次事变就是到现在还铭刻在台湾省人民脑筋里的西来庵事件（即噍吧年惨案）。一九三零年高山族人民与日本军队抗战一个多月，即雾社事件，被日军用飞机漫山遍野散播毒瓦斯，使该族有极惨重的死亡。
    台湾省人民不但为着民族的自由不惜付出任何代价，前仆后继地进行血肉的斗争，并且更坚决反对日寇的“同化政策”，反对它的严禁使用中国语文，拒绝和日人的通婚，以保持民族血统的纯洁，更在祖先的基石上刻着如“同安”、“龙溪”等地名，以表明自己为中国人民。在长时期中，台湾省人民时刻热切关怀祖国人民的革命运动，闻胜则喜，闻败则忧，许多青年经历千难万苦，奔回祖国献身革命。
    在祖国人民坚决反对日本帝国主义的侵略之下，一九四三年的开罗宣言和一九四五年的波茨坦宣言，终于确定了台湾归还中国。当时，正处在日本黩武主义者铁蹄下的台湾省人民，听到了这些消息，都无不喜形于色，奔走相告，觉得五十年来被异族统治的奴隶生活就可摆脱，而将重归祖国怀抱。到了一九四五年秋日本投降后，台湾省人民终于达到了宿愿而重归祖国。台湾省人民以无比热烈的情绪，来庆祝台湾归还祖国，欢迎大陆同胞和祖国的政权与军队的到来。虽然后来事实证明台湾省人民误将国民党反动政府认作代表祖国人民的政权，但全省人民拥护开罗、波茨坦宣言，拥护归还祖国，这是绝对不能否认的事实。
    中国的败类国民党反动派对台湾省人民实施残暴的剥削和压迫，引起了全省人民的坚决反抗。一九四七年二月二十八日的全省人民起义，就是其中最大的一次。在这次斗争中，台湾省人民对蒋匪帮进行了英勇无比的斗争，全省人民配合祖国的爱国民主革命，要求结束国民党反动派的统治，和全国人民一起获得民主自由。
    千百年来，汉族人民以无比的勇敢、勤劳的精神，用自己的血和汗，开垦了台湾，保卫了台湾，建设了台湾，把这个荒芜的海岛变成为自己的美丽的家园和神圣的国土。为了反抗侵略者和压迫者，台湾省人民进行了长期壮烈的斗争，发扬了中华民族英勇不屈的优秀传统和强烈的爱国主义精神。台湾是中国的领土，台湾人民是中国的人民。我们台湾人民自始至终要求重归祖国怀抱，和祖国同胞共同生活，反对任何人为的分离，这是铁一般的事实，决不是任何人所能否认，也不是任何力量所能改变的。尤其在今天全国大陆已基本上解放，祖国人民已有了自己的政权，和开始享受美好生活的时候，台湾省人民返回祖国的愿望即更加迫切，意志亦更加坚决，绝不是像杜鲁门之类的谎言与威胁所能歪曲或阻止得了的。
    中国人民尤其是台湾省人民，知道得非常清楚，自抗日胜利之后，蒋匪帮接收了日寇半世纪来从台湾省人民榨取与掠夺去的膏血——大部分土地与企业而自肥，而美帝国主义者更通过蒋匪帮的支持，实施对台湾省人民的剥削，以致今日全省人民的生活陷入空前的悲惨境地。我们知道：当蒋匪帮接收台湾的第一天开始，美帝国主义者就想实现其把台湾变为它的殖民地的计划，一面唆使奸人鼓吹“托管”、“独立”；一面利用蒋匪帮的卖国奴性，渐次实现其直接统治台湾省的目的。这次，六月二十七日杜鲁门的声言，不过是将其原定侵略台湾的阴谋计划公开暴露与进一步行动罢了。美帝国主义者派遣其海空军侵入台湾，企图以武力来阻止我们解放台湾，不但是直接侵犯我领土主权，危害全国人民、尤其是台湾省人民的利益，彻底破坏联合国宪章的罪恶行为，并且是企图进一步实现其侵占我台湾省的阴谋。中国人民，尤其是台湾省人民，有权要求美国政府必须立即自台湾撤出其一切武装军队，并加紧努力来支援解放台湾，击破美帝侵略的野心与阴谋。
    台湾民主自治同盟代表我台湾省全体人民的意志与愿望，坚决支持中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长历次所作的关于美国政府侵略台湾的声明和抗议。台湾省人民以无比愤慨的情绪，誓必加紧团结起来，为反对美国侵略，为消灭蒋匪帮的反动统治和争取台湾的早日解放而奋斗到底。
