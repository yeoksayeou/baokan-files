　　Hero Liu Si'hu
　　Lin Wei
　　Comrade Liu Si'hu is from Fengzhen, Suiyuan, 24 years old, joined the People's Liberation Army in 1946, joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1947, and is currently the deputy company commander of the 6th Company of a certain unit of the First Field Army. He worked as an apprentice from a young age, serving people, without earning a single penny for six years. His father was a plasterer, forced into bankruptcy by local tyrants, and died by hanging himself with a grievance. In the army, Si'hu loves his comrades like brothers. He takes hardship first and enjoys later; he can patiently enlighten and help comrades with wavering thoughts, and has made significant achievements in consolidating the troops. His body is not strong, but he has shown great courage and tenacity in every battle, repeatedly performing miraculous feats. The army selected him as an all-round special-class hero. The First Field Army launched a "Learn from Liu Si'hu" movement. His heroic deeds have been adapted into dramas and widely disseminated in the army.

　　You would be surprised and doubtful that he is alive and meeting you!
　　Anyone, if you know the suffering history of our nation and people, then facing a brother like Liu Si'hu who has endured more suffering himself to free our nation and people from suffering, you probably won't be indifferent! Stroking his body covered with knife wounds and bullet marks, you will feel strong relief and doubt that he is alive and meeting you, you will feel heartache. On his head and face alone, he was stabbed five times by despicable enemies. One knife was stabbed in the neck close to the throat, one in the middle of the abdomen, and one under the left rib. Three knives were stabbed in his left hand, one of which pierced the muscle between his thumb and index finger. In addition, a bullet entered frontally between his left eye and the bridge of his nose, and exited behind his ear. A large amount of flying stone was splashed on his right face and right eye by enemy bullets. His right leg was shot with four holes by two bullets. Even today, whenever it is cloudy and rainy, or he shaves, the wounds are still painfully unbearable. His left eye is blind, his right eye is not as bright as before, and his right leg is not walking very well.
　　However, this young warrior has never had any abnormal emotions about his semi-disabled state. He works quietly and does all kinds of things he should do, just like other comrades in the army.

　　“I want to live and kill a few more of them!”
　　"Even if I die, it's worth it. I want to live and kill a few more of them." His thoughts on his own life and death are so calm, so simple and clear. This unshakable wish contains infinite hatred for the cruel and despicable enemy. Once on the battlefield, when he meets the enemy, this hatred gives him infinite power.
　　Before joining the army at the age of twenty, the object of this young warrior's hatred was only the people who oppressed him in his hometown. His motivation for joining the army was only to avenge these people. After joining the army, he quickly understood that the masterminds and sources of evil behind the bullies were imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and his hatred immediately turned entirely to these bandits. He regarded these bandits as the most hateful pests.
　　In 1946, when our troops attacked Datong, he had only been in the army for less than a month, had just learned to use a gun, and was not very proficient in various combat actions, and his physique was also very weak. But no matter how dense the enemy's bullets were, he always rushed to the front, like a tiger. He had only one thought, which was "kill a few of them"!

　　Automatically stood on the position of certain death
　　Although he was seriously injured in the first battle, he was not timid because of it. The lesson he learned was: a bullet can pass through the brain from the side of the bridge of the nose and still not die, and it is even less certain to die if it hits somewhere else! Many old soldiers have been injured several times! Even if he died, it would be better than his father being forced to hang himself! Thus, after only a month, he walked back to his company and was as brave as before. In the Xihuachi battle in Gansu the following year, the company's assault failed, and they were blocked in a courtyard by the superior enemy forces who set fire. In a moment of urgency, he volunteered to take on the cover, stood on the position of certain death, and let everyone withdraw. His right leg was hit by two bullets and he fell; he pulled the pin of the grenade and placed it beside him, preparing to perish together with the enemy when they approached. At that time, only a few wounded soldiers who could not retreat remained to hold the position with him. But the cowardly enemy never dared to approach them, until our army fought up at night.

　　As long as you can persevere, not afraid of death, there is hope of breaking a path to survival. This is the lesson he learned from the second serious injury. Our warriors learn the special laws of life and death on the battlefield in this way, making themselves stronger, which is the ideological foundation for him to create immortal achievements in the Yichuan Campaign in February 1948.

　　The Yichuan Campaign, which annihilated 40,000 enemies and killed Liu Kan, commander of the enemy's reorganized 29th Army, caused a major change in the entire situation of the Northwest battlefield. But at that time, our firepower was not yet dominant, and we could not suppress the enemy. The assault mission was still very dangerous, and we had to be prepared to sacrifice at any time. The company to which Comrade Si'hu belonged was the main assault company responsible for capturing the southeastern highlands of Wazijie, Yichuan. The second squad he led was the assault squad of the company. When the first hill was captured, seven of their eight people remained. The enemy deployed a regiment of troops on the second hill. Their military headquarters, division headquarters, and brigade headquarters were all stationed there. In the forward fortifications, a strict fire net composed of light and heavy weapons blocked the open area that we had to pass through during the attack. As the seven warriors flew across this open area, four more fell. Comrade Si'hu climbed up and down the snow-covered steep slope and bravely advanced, in one breath reaching a large tree ten steps away from the enemy. Looking back, only three people, including himself, were left. The enemy discovered them, and batches of grenades were thrown over, exploding all around. While nimbly dodging, they used the butts of their guns to deflect the grenades thrown by the enemy that were spinning on the ground, or picked them up and returned them to the enemy.

　　One person rushed into the enemy's position
　　Three people are three people, we must stab a pile of these pests to death when we go up? So they launched another brave charge of three people. The remaining two warriors fell in the final charge, and Comrade Si'hu, using the smoke from the four grenades he threw out, charged into the enemy's position alone with his bayonet. This divine courage frightened the enemies who were greedy for life and afraid of death, and they turned around and窜backward. The machine gunner threw down the machine gun and was about to flee. Comrade Si'hu kicked the machine gun away and stabbed him. In the time it takes to eat a bowl of rice, he stabbed seven or eight running enemies, and a large number of them lay down.

　　They dare not hand over their guns! Comrade Si'hu continued to pursue angrily and uncontrollably. However, the enemy commander finally discovered that the pursuer was only a lone person! So he used a pistol to force the sixteen or seventeen enemy soldiers who were running around to turn around and surround him. Comrade Si'hu was surrounded in the center, and he had no bullets or grenades. So he rotated back and forth with his bayonet. The enemy had everything, but they could not use anything. They could not shoot bullets, and they did not dare to approach with bayonets. The side where Comrade Si'hu's bayonet pointed, they retreated in a panic. The enemy commander threatened with execution and pushed forward with his hands, but none of it worked. The enemy's farce lasted for forty minutes, and they were still unable to do anything to our warriors.

　　Saving comrades, forgetting himself
　　At this time, Comrade Si'hu heard faint shouts of killing outside, so he rushed out and ran forward to the front line. The first thing he saw was Squad Leader Shu Zhaoming fighting the enemy in close combat. Seeing that the enemy had pressed Shu Zhaoming to the ground and was砍砍砍砍his head with a shovel. Comrade Si'hu, regardless of the enemies chasing him from behind, stabbed the enemy's skull who was pressing on Shu Zhaoming with all his might. Unexpectedly, the enemy shrank his head, causing Si'hu to fall into the narrow traffic trench, with his right hand and gun pressed under him, unable to turn over. The chasing enemies stabbed his head and face with trembling bayonets, and he used his last strength to resist desperately with his left hand. Suddenly he grabbed the enemy's刺來的刀, and wanted to use the momentum to turn himself over, which frightened the enemy and乱刺his hand in panic. At this time, Comrade Si'hu was bleeding from eleven places on his head and body, and finally倒倒倒倒. The enemy felt that he was mostly dead; or perhaps they were still afraid that he would grab the bayonet and pounce again, so they stopped stabbing, and finally stabbed his forehead hard and left.

　　He actually came back to life!
　　Comrade Si'hu passed out, but he did not die! His glorious life finally returned to his bloody body. This was the result of his earth-shattering heroic spirit completely breaking the enemy's courage.

　　The Yichuan Campaign was victorious. 40,000 enemies were finally annihilated in the bloody battle of countless warriors like Liu Si'hu. Only two months later, the democratic holy land of Yan'an was also recovered. The Northwest was laughing, and the whole of China was laughing. But this laughter was exchanged for the blood of so many dear comrades, and for enduring such great pain! Every son and daughter of the new China and our children should know how to cherish their motherland! (Attached picture)

　　英雄刘四虎
    林韦
    刘四虎同志，绥远丰镇人，二十四岁，一九四六年参加人民解放军，一九四七年参加中国共产党，现任第一野战军某部六连副连长。从小当学徒，伺候人，六年没挣一个钱。父亲为泥水匠，被地方恶霸逼得倾家荡产，含冤上吊而死。四虎在部队中，爱同志如兄弟。吃苦在前，享受在后；对思想不坚定的同志，能耐心启发帮助，在巩固部队上有显著成绩。他的身体并不强，但在每次战斗中均表现高度的英勇顽强，屡创奇功。一军选他为全面的特等英雄。一野曾开展“学习刘四虎”运动。他的英雄业迹，被部队编成戏剧普遍传播着。
          —记者
  你会为他能活着和你见面感到惊疑！
    无论谁，如果你是知道我们民族和人民的苦难历史的，那你面对着刘四虎这样为使我们民族和人民摆脱苦难而自己忍受了更多苦难的兄弟，大概总不会无动于衷的！抚摸着他的遍体刀伤弹痕，你会为他能活着和你见面感到强烈的欣慰和惊疑，你会觉得心酸。光是他的头上和脸上，就被卑污的敌人刺过五刀。脖子上紧接咽喉的地方和腹部正中间、左脥下，每处被刺一刀。左手上被刺三刀，其中一刀刺穿拇指食指之间的筋肉。另外，一粒子弹从左眼与鼻梁之间正面打进去，从耳后穿出来。右脸与右眼被敌弹打起来的大片飞石砸伤。右腿上被两个子弹打了四个洞。直到今天，每逢天阴下雨、剃发刮脸，伤处仍然疼痛难忍。左眼失明了，右眼不如从前亮了，右腿也走着不很得劲了。
    但是，这位青年勇士从来没有为自己这种半残废状态发生过任何不正常的情绪，他完全同部队上别的同志一样安安静静地照常工作，认真做着各种应该做的事情。
  “我要活着，还得干他几个！”
    “就算我死了，也换得过啦。我要活着，还得干他几个。”对于自身的生死，他的想法就是这样平静，这样简单明白。“干他几个”这一不可动摇的愿望，蕴蓄着对于残忍卑污的敌人的无穷憎恨。一到战场，与敌人相见，这种憎恨就给他以无穷的力量。
    这位青年勇士在二十岁参军以前，憎恨的对象还只是家乡上压榨自己的人。参军的动机也只是向这些人报仇。参军以后，他很快懂得了恶霸们的后台老板和罪恶的渊薮乃是帝国主义和它的走狗蒋介石匪帮，他的憎恨立即全部转向这些匪帮。他把这些匪帮看作最可恶的害虫。
    一九四六年我们部队攻打大同时，他参军不到一个月，刚学预备用枪，各种战斗动作都还很不熟练，体格也很弱。但他不管敌人子弹打得多密，总冲在最前头，像猛虎一样。他只有一个念头，就是“干他几个”！
  自动站上必死的岗位
    虽然在第一仗中他就受了重伤，但他并没因此胆怯。他所接受的教训是：子弹从鼻梁边穿脑而过尚且可以不死，打伤别处更不一定就死！老战士们受过好几次伤的多着哩！就算死了，也比父亲叫人家逼着上了吊强！这样，不过一月，他又走回自己的连队，和以前一样勇敢。次年甘肃西华池战斗中，连队突击失利，被优势的敌军放火封锁在一个院子里。万急之中，他自报奋勇担任掩护，站上必死的岗位，让大家撤出。他的右腿连中两弹，倒了；便把手榴弹拉开线放在身边，准备在敌人逼近时与敌同归于尽。当时与他共同坚守阵地的，只剩下几个撤不出去的伤员。但胆怯的敌人始终没敢接近他们，直到天晚时我军打了上来。
    只要能坚持，不怕死，就有杀开活路的希望。这是他从第二次重伤中接受的教训。我们的勇士就是这样学习着战场上生和死的特殊规律，使自己更加坚强，这就是他在一九四八年二月宜川战役中创造不朽功绩的思想基础。
    歼敌四万、击毙敌整编二十九军军长刘堪的宜川战役，曾使大西北战场整个形势发生重大的变化。但当时我们的火力还不是优势，压不倒敌人，突击任务仍是十分危险，须得随时准备牺牲的。四虎同志所在的连队，担任攻取宜川瓦子街东南高地的主攻连队。他所领导的二班，担任该连突击班。攻下第一个山头时，他们八个人剩了七个。第二个山头，敌人布置了一个团的兵力。他们的军部、师部、旅部都扎在那儿。前沿工事里，一个排以轻重武器组成的严密火网封锁着我们进攻时必须通过的开阔地。七个勇士在飞奔过这片开阔地时，又有四个倒下去。四虎同志在覆着冰雪的陡坡中爬上滑下地奋勇跃进，一口气穿到离敌十来步远的一棵大树跟前。回头一看，连自己只剩了三个人。敌人发觉了，一批批的手榴弹打过来，前后左右都在爆炸。他们一面灵敏地躲闪，一面用枪托把敌人扔过来在地上乱转着的手榴弹拨到山下，或拾起来回击敌人。
  一人冲进敌军阵地
    三个人就三个人，上去就得把这伙害虫戳死他一堆？于是又发起三个人的勇猛冲锋。其余两个勇士在最后冲锋中倒下去了，四虎同志借着自己打出去四个手榴弹的烟雾一个人端着刺刀冲入敌人阵地。这神勇骇昏了贪生怕死的敌人，扭回头往后窜。机枪手扔下机枪正要窜走，四虎同志一脚踢开机枪就刺过去。一碗饭的工夫，他把狂奔着的敌人刺倒七、八个，躺下一大片。
    他们竟敢不交枪！四虎同志怒不可遏地继续猛追过去。但是，敌人的指挥官最后发觉了追击者只是孤零零的一个人！于是用手枪逼迫乱跑着的十六、七个敌兵回头包围过来。四虎同志被围在中心，子弹手榴弹都没了，便端着刺刀前后左右旋转。敌人什么都有，但都无法施展。子弹既不能打，刺刀又不敢逼近。四虎同志的刀尖指向那边，那边便慌忙后退。敌指挥官用枪毙来威胁，用手往前推，都不生效，敌人这种丑剧，表演了有四十分钟之久，始终不能奈何我们的勇士。
  救同志忘记了自己
    此时，四虎同志听到外面有隐约的喊杀声，便一冲而出，向前沿飞奔。第一眼看到的是一班长舒照明同志正在与敌肉搏。眼看敌人已将舒照明压在地上，用铁锹砍他的头。四虎同志不顾身后追赶自己的敌人，猛力向压着舒照明的敌人头盖刺去。不料敌人一缩头，把四虎闪落到狭窄的交通沟里，右手和枪压在身下，翻不起来了。追来的敌人用颤抖着的刀尖向他头上脸上刺去，他使出最后的精力用左手拚命抵抗。猛然间抓住了刺来的敌刀，便想借这刀势翻起身来，骇得敌人惊慌地向他手上乱刺。此时，四虎同志头上身上十一处冒血，终于倒了下去。敌人觉得他大半已经死去；也可能是仍害怕他再抓住刺刀扑起来，于是停止再刺，最后向他脑门上狠狠刺了一刀，走了。
  他竟活了转来！
    四虎同志昏了过去，但没有死！他的光辉的生命，最后又回到血肉模糊的躯体上来。这是他那惊天地泣鬼神的英雄气概使敌人完全骇破了胆的结果。
    宜川战役胜利了，四万敌人在刘四虎式的无数勇士浴血奋战中最后被歼灭了。其后不过两月，民主圣地延安也随着收复。大西北在欢笑，全中国在欢笑。但是，这欢笑是多少亲爱的同志支付出多少鲜血、忍受了多么巨大的痛楚才换得的呀！新中国的每一个儿女和我们的孩子，应该知道怎样珍爱自己祖国！（附图片）
