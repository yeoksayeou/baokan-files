[Jilin News] During the rectification movement, the state-owned Northeast Shixian Paper Mill focused on basic construction projects, unity of technical personnel, implementation of production instruction diagrams, and economic accounting ideology as the main content for inspecting the first half of the year's work. By the end of August, the capital construction project inspection had been completed, and preliminary methods for improving work had been drafted. The factory is currently continuing to inspect other major issues.

The factory began inspecting basic construction projects on August 3rd. At the inspection work meeting, the heads of the Party, government, and labor union, together with the head of the capital construction section, first summarized the capital construction projects of the first half of the year and made repeated self-criticism reports. Then, representatives of employees from various departments put forward their opinions, launching a serious criticism. The inspection revealed:

(1) The leadership did not have sufficient understanding and emphasis on capital construction projects, which was reflected in the inaccurate capital construction project plan for this year and the improper arrangement of construction sequence. When making plans, the leadership did not have precise calculations of subjective capabilities and objective conditions, but only made plans based on rough estimates. There were no design drawings before the plans were made, so it was impossible to have accurate plans for materials and man-hours. Because the design drawings could not be rushed out, new projects after "May Day" could not start on time, resulting in a shutdown of nearly two months during the peak construction season. In terms of construction sequence, the flood control dam should have been built before the flood season, but the plan scheduled it to start in August. The restoration project of the rayon series, which was not urgent, was included in the construction sequence ahead of schedule. These are all unrealistic manifestations.

This is because the factory leadership's ideology has not established a long-term construction perspective, treating capital construction projects as temporary work, and not understanding that failure to do a good job in capital construction will directly affect the development of production. Therefore, the factory management committee rarely discussed matters related to capital construction projects in the first half of the year, and did not establish various necessary systems. Although the higher authorities constantly pointed out the importance of capital construction projects, requiring leaders to personally inspect, and pay attention to project quality and material waste, the factory leadership did not pay attention to it, but thought that "our projects are not bad." Therefore, even if some things were inspected, it was only a formality.

(2) There is relatively serious bureaucracy in organizational leadership and work style. This is reflected in the fact that leading cadres usually do not personally inspect design drawings and material budgets, believing that the head of the capital construction section and engineers have stamped their seals, "probably there will be no mistakes." This often leads to temporary changes in design during construction, and even after the project has progressed to a certain stage, it is discovered that it is not practical. In terms of material procurement and management, a necessary system has not been established, resulting in purchased tie rods being rotten, and black iron pipes, brass pipes, etc., being bent and cracked and unusable. The leadership did not promptly deal with these serious waste situations and did not raise vigilance.

The lack of on-site staff, coupled with the lack of organization and education of contractors, is also one of the reasons for poor project quality and material waste. At that time, four projects were underway simultaneously, with only three supervisors and one material manager, while most of the staff sat in the office busy with statistical reports. The organization and education of the contracted workers was even worse, thinking that they had nothing to do with the factory and leaving it to the district trade union. They did not realize that they are also laboring working class. If they are organized and educated, they can improve work efficiency and project quality, reduce waste, and reduce the exploitation of them by contractors.

After the above shortcomings were boldly and sharply criticized by the masses and carefully inspected, the leadership has proposed the following improvement measures based on the lessons learned from the inspection: In order to make next year's project plan accurate, it must start with a correct and complete design. All projects should have design drawings made before making plans, and then calculate a more accurate labor and material budget based on the design drawings. To this end, in addition to correctly estimating the capabilities of existing designers and immediately assigning the design of various projects for next year, those whose capabilities are insufficient are planned to specially hire designers to help with the design on a temporary basis. At the same time, various project management systems will be formulated (three types, the supervision system, the material management system, and the project schedule, have now been determined, and it has been decided to make five more recently), increase on-site project management personnel, clarify responsibilities, and make specific project schedule charts for inspection and supervision. In order to resolutely complete this year's construction tasks, a new record movement will be launched to organize contractor workers to conduct education, and regularly convene project technical personnel to study construction methods, so as to more effectively exert work efficiency and ensure project quality.

　　国营石岘造纸厂整风运动中
    抓住主要问题分别进行检查
    基建工程的浪费问题现已检查完毕
    【本报吉林讯】国营东北石岘造纸厂在整风中以基本修建工程、团结技术人员，生产指示图的执行及经济核算思想等项为检查上半年工作的主要内容，至八月末已将基建工程检查完毕，并拟出初步改进工作办法。该厂现正继续检查其他各主要问题。
    该厂由八月三日开始检查基本修建工程。在检查工作会议上，首先由党、政、工负责人与基建科长总结上半年基建工程做了反复的检讨报告，又经各部门职工代表提出意见，展开了严肃的批评，在检查中发现：
    （一）领导上对基建工程的认识与重视不够，表现在今年的基建工程计划不准确，动工顺序排列不当。领导上在作计划时没有精密的计算主观能力和客观条件，只凭概括的估计来作计划；制订计划前没有设计图样，因而在材料、工数的计划就不可能正确；因为设计图样赶不出，“五一”以后的新工程不能及时动工，致在修建旺季停工将近两月。在工序排列上，防水堤本应在洪水期前修起，但计划却订在八月动工；人造丝系列的恢复工程，本不急于进行，却又提前列入工序，这些都是不切合实际的表现。
    这是由于该厂领导思想上没有树立长期建设观点，把基建工程当作临时工作，不懂得基建工程做不好将直接影响生产的发展，因而上半年来工厂管理委员会很少讨论有关基建工程的事项，也没有建立各项必要的制度，上级虽不断的指出重视基建工程，要求领导亲自检查，注意工程质量和材料浪费等，但该厂领导并未引起重视，却以为“咱们的工程还差不多”，因而即使有些事情检查也是形式的。
    （二）组织领导及工作作风上存在着较严重的官僚主义。表现在领导干部平素对设计图样及工料预算没有亲自检查，认为基建科长、工程师都盖了章，“大概不会有什么错”。致使施工中经常有临时改变设计的情况，甚至工程已进行到一定程度，才发现不合实用。在材料的采购和管理方面也没有建立一套必要的制度，致采购来的绞手杆子均已腐朽，黑铁管子、黄铜管子等弯曲有裂纹不能用，这些严重浪费情况领导上都没及时处理并引起警惕。
    由于现场工作人员太少，加之对包工缺乏组织教育，这也是造成工程质量不好和材料浪费的原因之一。当时四项工程并进，只有三个监工员，一个材料管理员，而大部人员坐在办公室里忙于统计报告。对包工工人的组织教育做的更差，以为他们与工厂无关，交给区工会就不管了。没认识到他们也是劳动的工人阶级，如将他们组织起来进行教育，既能提高工作效率及工程质量、减少浪费而又能减少包工头对他们的剥削。
    上述诸缺点经过群众大胆而尖锐的提出批评与比较仔细的检查，领导上已根据检查中所得的教训提出了今后的改进办法：为了将明年的工程计划作的准确，首先必须从正确的完整的设计开始，一切工程都应在做计划之前做出设计图样，然后根据设计图样算出比较正确的工、料预算。为此，除正确的估计现有设计人员之能力，并立即分配明年各项工程设计外，其能力不足者，拟专聘设计师临时帮助设计。同时制定各项工程管理制度（现已定出监工制度、材料管理制度、工程进度表三种，决定于最近再作出五种），增加工程现场管理人员，明确职责，并做出具体的工程进度图表，以资检查督促。为了坚决完成今年修建任务，将通过新纪录运动，组织包工工人进行教育，定期召集工程技术人员研究施工方法，以便更有效的发挥工作效率，并保证工程质量。
