Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch:

　　戚云, a member of the Chinese People's Delegation and representative of the Chinese Democratic Women's Federation who visited Korea, spoke to our reporter about the heroic deeds of Korean women in the Korean War of Liberation. She said: "As soon as we entered Korean territory, we got a clear impression: women are seen everywhere. In the countryside, women were walking hurriedly with things on their heads; some were working in the fields with children on their backs. In factories, the number of female workers in many places exceeded 50% of the total number of workers in the factory. Korean women are responding to the call of the Korean Democratic Women's Union: 'Replace all the labor of men going to the front' and 'Everything for the front,' fighting bravely on the front lines and in the rear like men."

　　Since the outbreak of the war, Korean women have risen up to join the army and wartime work. In North Korea, more than 200,000 women have volunteered to join the army. In Kangwon Province alone, more than 68,000 of the 150,000 people who signed up for the army were women. Almost all female students above junior high school participated in volunteer teams and medical teams. Hundreds of young women in Pyongyang went to the municipal committee of the Democratic Youth League and waited for three days, asking to go to the front.

　　In South Korea, there had long been many female guerrilla fighters. After the Lee Seung-man puppet army provoked the civil war, they became even more active in coordinating with the People's Army in combat. According to the director of the Pyongyang Injured Soldiers Hospital, dozens of female guerrilla fighters who had been wounded in combat were recently recuperating in the hospital and have now recovered and returned to the front.

　　Korean women also actively participate in the work of repairing bridges and building roads to ensure transportation to the front. A large number of women participated in the intense work of repairing the Han River Railway Bridge, which was repeatedly bombed by enemy planes. According to statistics from the South Korean Democratic Women's Union, 220,000 women in Seoul alone participated in repairing bridges and building roads. They work as hard as men, fighting day and night.

　　Female workers and farmers on the production front have organized wartime work teams in factories and rural areas. Female workers have demonstrated unparalleled enthusiasm, working 12 hours a day, with the highest productivity reaching 261% of the original plan. They voluntarily donate their wages for the hours they work beyond the eight-hour workday to the state.

　　Women also donate "Women's" airplanes and tanks, collect comfort items, and organize laundry teams. From cities to villages, every woman has been mobilized.

　　Korean women have a high degree of organization. Their own organization, the South and North Korean Democratic Women's League, has 2.8 million members. Since the "August 15th" Liberation, the North Korean Democratic Women's Union has eliminated illiteracy among women, mobilized women to participate in economic construction, and organized scattered housewives. At the beginning of the war, a special work committee was organized to ensure the thorough implementation of government orders and calls. The South Korean Democratic Women's Union also has a five-year history, but it was forced to go underground in 1948. Its cadres have almost all been imprisoned and tortured.

　　It is no accident that Korean women work and fight so selflessly. This is because they have a high degree of love for their motherland and a deep hatred for the irreconcilable national enemy. The American imperialists are ferocious wolves to unarmed women and children. In Wonsan alone, more than 4,000 people were killed or injured by American planes, 80% of whom were women and children. In the areas awaiting liberation, women are still being insulted by the beastly American imperialist soldiers. For example, in Chungju County, North Chungcheong Province, all the young women in the county were taken away by the U.S. military, and their whereabouts are still unknown. As for the number of women raped by the U.S. military and the Lee Seung-man bandits, it is impossible to calculate. The Korean people will never forget this blood feud.

　　However, the atrocities of the American imperialists not only cannot destroy the Korean people's will to fight, but also increase the Korean people's shared hatred of the enemy. The Korean people know that in order to achieve the unification and independence of their motherland and their own happy lives, they must defeat the American imperialist bandits. Every Korean we met, regardless of gender or age, was full of confidence in achieving final victory.

　　Lee Im-kyung, a 40- or 50-year-old female attendant at the guest house where the delegation stayed, said well: "We are full of confidence and certainty in achieving final victory. The American devils must be wiped out if they do not surrender. The Korean people have the support of the great Soviet people, the Chinese people, and all peace-loving people in the world behind them."

### 英勇斗争中的朝鲜妇女  在前线和后方忘我地工作与战斗

　　英勇斗争中的朝鲜妇女
    在前线和后方忘我地工作与战斗
    戚云访问朝鲜归来谈话
    【新华社一日讯】访问朝鲜返国的中国人民代表团团员、中国民主妇联代表戚云，向本社记者畅谈朝鲜妇女在朝鲜解放战争中的英勇斗争事迹称：一进入朝鲜国境，我们就得到一个鲜明的印象，就是：到处都看到妇女。在农村，妇女头上顶着东西，匆忙地走着；有的背上背着孩子在田间操作。在工厂中，许多地方的女工人数，超过全厂工人数的百分之五十。朝鲜妇女们响应着朝鲜民主妇女联合会的号召：“代替上前线的男子的一切劳动”、“一切为着前线”，和男子们一样，在前线和后方英勇地战斗着。
    战事发生以来，朝鲜妇女们奋起参加军队和战时工作。在北朝鲜，自动要求参军的妇女已在二十万人以上。单说江源道，报名参军的十五万人中间就有六万八千余人是妇女。初中以上的女学生差不多全体参加了义勇队和救护队。平壤市有好几百个女青年到民主青年同盟市委会，坐候三天，要求上前线。
    在南朝鲜，早就有了许多女游击战士。在李承晚伪军挑起内战后，她们就更加活跃地配合着人民军作战。据平壤伤兵医院的院长说：不久以前，曾有好几十个作战负伤的女游击队员在医院疗养，现在已经伤愈重上前线了。
    朝鲜妇女们同样积极地参加着修桥筑路的工作，以保证前线的运输。在修复多次被敌机炸毁的汉江铁桥的紧张工作中，就有大批妇女参加。据南朝鲜民主妇女联合会的统计，仅汉城一地，参加修桥筑路的妇女就有二十二万人。她们不分昼夜，和男子一样地辛勤地工作着，战斗着。
    在生产战线上的女工和农妇，组织了工厂和农村的战时作业班。女工们发挥了无比的积极性，每天工作十二小时，生产率最高的达到原计划的百分之二百六十一。她们八小时工作时间以外的工资，都自动地捐献给国家。
    妇女们还捐献“妇女号”飞机、坦克，募集慰劳品，组织洗衣队。从城市到乡村，每一个妇女都动员起来了。
    朝鲜妇女有着高度的组织性，她们自己的组织——南、北朝鲜民主女性同盟有着二百八十万盟员。“八、一五”解放以来，北朝鲜民主妇女联合会扫除了妇女文盲，发动妇女参加经济建设，把散漫的家庭妇女组织了起来。战争一开始，就组织了特别工作委员会，保证政府政令与号召的彻底执行。南朝鲜民主妇女联合会也有五年历史，但它在一九四八年就被迫转入地下。它的干部几乎都坐过牢，受过刑。
    朝鲜妇女所以这样忘我地工作与战斗，不是偶然的。这是由于她们对自己祖国有高度的热爱，对不共戴天的民族敌人有深刻的仇恨的缘故。美帝国主义者对于手无寸铁的妇女儿童，是凶残的豺狼。元山一地，被美机炸死、炸伤的人数在四千以上，其中百分之八十是妇孺。在待解放区，妇女还受到美帝国主义兽军的侮辱。例如在忠清北道的忠州县，全县青年妇女都被美军带走，迄今下落不明。至于被美军和李承晚匪军强奸的更是无法统计。这种血海深仇是朝鲜人民永远不会忘记的。
    但是美帝国主义者的暴行，不但不能摧毁朝鲜人民斗争的意志，而且更增加了朝鲜人民的同仇敌忾。朝鲜人民知道，为了祖国的统一、独立和自己的幸福生活，就非把美帝国主义强盗击败不可。我们遇见的每一个朝鲜人，无论男女老少，对于取得最后胜利都充满着信心。
    代表团所住的招待所有一位四、五十岁的女招待员李妊卿说得好：“我们完全有信心、有把握取得最后的胜利。美国鬼子不投降就一定要被消灭。朝鲜人民的背后有着伟大的苏联人民、中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人们的支援。”
