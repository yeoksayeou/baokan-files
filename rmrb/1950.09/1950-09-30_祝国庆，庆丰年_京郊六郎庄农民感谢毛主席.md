  Land Reform Brought a Bumper Harvest
    Liulangzhuang in the suburbs of Beijing is a well-known production area for Beijing West Rice. The village completed land reform last winter. After the spring this year, the emancipated peasants engaged in production with great enthusiasm. Every household applied more manure and bean cake fertilizer to their fields than in previous years. Even before the Qingming Festival, some people were already in the fields repairing the paddy ridges. Hoeing the soil (that is, before transplanting rice seedlings, turning over the previous year's rice stubble by hand to rot it in the field), transplanting rice seedlings, and weeding were also done with particular vigor. In the spring, the entire village worked together to repair the two major ditches east and west of the village, dredging the original five-zhang-wide water outlet of the West Zhalan, which had later been walled up to five or six chi by the landlord Xia Xiru and turned into farmland for rent. They raised the stone bridge and removed the ditch grass. After the water flowed smoothly, more than 500 mu of land that had been flooded year after year became fertile fields. More than 6,000 mu of paddy fields in Liulangzhuang, Bagou, and Haidian avoided flooding. In less than a year after the land reform, Liulangzhuang achieved a bumper harvest that was rare in previous years. In the past, the average yield of rice fields in the village was 2.4 shi of rice per mu. The village had more than 3,600 mu of paddy fields, yielding about 8,760 shi. This year, the yield per mu is 2.7 shi, and the whole village can harvest 8,970 shi. The village has successfully completed its production increase plan.
    From Haidian West to the Summer Palace, the area around Liulangzhuang looks like a golden ocean. The heavy, drooping, golden rice ears full of grains are interspersed with patches of green lotus ponds and water chestnuts. Early-maturing small rice is being harvested. Large fields of Hongmang rice are about to be harvested. In the fields and threshing grounds, people are busy cutting, drying, and threshing rice, and bundling straw. The sound of the rice threshers on the threshing ground echoes with the joyful laughter of the people. The cooperative has more than a dozen brightly painted red rice threshers ready to be lent out. The courtyard is crowded with farmers registering for loans. The people do not think the price of 650 jin of millet for a rice thresher is expensive. As many farmers say, "It's a rare good year." The bumper harvest has changed the face of the countryside.
  Three "Mores" Before Land Reform
    Before land reform, Liulangzhuang had three "mores": more paddy fields, more tenant farmers, and more hired laborers. The village had 210 mu of dry land and 3,684 mu of paddy fields. Among them, landlords occupied 2,223 mu of paddy fields. Landlords and rich peasants occupied more than 75 percent of the village's paddy fields. Xia Xiru, known as "Fifth Master Xia" of the village's famous "Twenty-Four" gentry, not only dominated the fertile land and the water, but also opened large grain stores called "Xiangji" and "Xinxingyuan" in Haidian Town. They collected grain from rented land in autumn with large measures, and bought crops at low prices and sold grain at high prices during the lean season, and lent money at usurious interest rates. The farmers who grew rice could not afford to eat rice, and they had to go to "Xiangji" to exchange for coarse grains. The farmers of Liulangzhuang lost their land under such layers of exploitation. Of the 457 households in the village, hired laborers accounted for 210 households. They were busy all year round, unable to eat enough, unable to buy land, or even rent land. The hired laborer Liu Jinrong had worked as a long-term laborer for three generations and had not acquired a single mu of land. He is only forty years old this year, but he has been working for twenty-three years. Father and son worked a hundred days each autumn, which was not enough for a family of six to eat. After the autumn harvest, they quickly tried to find ways to make a living by selling sweet potatoes, vegetables, carrying coal, and digging water chestnuts. They muddled through for decades, for generations.
  Emancipated Farmer Liu Jinrong
    After land reform, everything changed. As Liu Jinrong said, "I never thought this day would come!" In the land reform, the peasants were allocated 2.337 mu of paddy fields, 176 mu of dry land, 62,000 jin of rice, more than 44,000 jin of rice seeds, as well as farm tools and houses. With a little effort in spring and summer, the situation this autumn is very different. Take Liu Jinrong as an example. He was allocated 9.4 mu of paddy fields, planted 7 mu of rice, and more than 2 mu of water chestnuts. The land is third-grade land. He said, "The land is a little worse, but it can't yield less than other people's land. In the hands of the landlord, it could only yield 1.8 or 1.9 shi, close to 2 shi. When I took it over, I worked diligently, and this year it will yield 2.5 shi, and next year it will be even better." He calculated his harvest: 7 mu of land yields 17.5 shi of rice. The edamame planted on the rice stalks yielded 280 jin this year. The two mu of water chestnuts grew well and were more profitable than rice. He and his brother went out to do odd jobs and earned more than 1,700 jin of old corn. He said, "This year, after the land was allocated, we can eat our fill and still have surplus. After harvesting the grain, we will make some farm tools and exchange for clothes. My father, my family, my brother, and my two students (referring to his sons) all need to be replaced. Digging water chestnuts during the New Year will bring in some cash. It would be nice to add a jin of cotton padded trousers and jackets, and buy some needles and thread."
    Liu recently moved into the three bright folk houses with large glass windows that were allocated to him. At the same time, he is preparing to hold a wedding for his brother. Now Liu Jinrong has been selected as a representative of the Beijing suburban agricultural labor model and is attending the National Congress of Labor, Peasant and Soldier Labor Models.
    When there was a drought last year, the village water conservancy management committee asked Liu Jinrong to be responsible for regulating water use. He was very careful in managing the water and tried to persuade the masses not to snatch water, so that all the paddy fields in the village were irrigated. During the land reform, he also worked actively in the farmers' association, joined the party, and was elected as the production committee member of the village government. He and the village cadres jointly mobilized the masses to repair ditches and catch locust eggs this spring. He also constantly helped others with repairing ridges, cultivating seedlings, and watching water. He said, "I have been working for more than twenty years and have gained some experience. If people have any difficulties in production, they come to me to discuss them. I tell them everything I know. I do it for everyone, and everyone knows my intention. For example, when I went into the water to pull the gate and broke my arm, twenty or thirty families came to see me every day, and people hoeed my land in an hour." This time he was elected as a representative of the Beijing suburban labor model and kept saying, "I never thought this day would come. I had never been in this position before." Recalling the days of suffering in the past, he said, "Why shouldn't we produce well! In the past, we had no land and couldn't eat enough. Today, Chairman Mao gives you a few mu of land and asks you to produce. If you still don't produce well and still can't eat enough, then it's unforgivable. How can we be worthy of Chairman Mao!"
  Going to See Chairman Mao
    In addition to being busy harvesting rice, the farmers of Liulangzhuang are also busy with another major event. On October 1st, more than 200 people from the village will go to the city to participate in the National Day demonstration parade. They said, "It's just the time when the fields are busy, but we still have to go to see Chairman Mao!"

  土地改革带来了丰收
    北京市郊六郎庄，是有名的京西大米出产地。该村在去年冬天完成了土地改革，今年开春后，翻身农民热情生产，谁家地里的大粪、豆饼都上得比往年足；还不到清明，老早就有人下地抹稻埂了。捉地（即稻田插秧前，将去年的稻楂用手翻过，使其烂在地里），插秧、薅草也干得特别起劲。春天，全村动手修好村东村西两条大沟，挑开了原来五丈多宽，而后来被地主夏锡儒砌成五、六尺，开成田地出租的西栅栏水口子，升高石桥，薅除沟草，水流畅通后，常年被涝的五百来亩地变成了良田。六郎庄、巴沟、海甸六千多亩稻地避免了涝灾。土改后不到一年，六郎庄就得到了常年难遇的丰收。往年，该村稻地平均每亩能收大米两石四，全村稻田三千六百余亩，约收八千七百六十余石；而今年每亩收成两石七，全村即可收八千九百七十余石。胜利完成了该村的增产计划。
    从海甸西至颐和园，六郎庄周围像一片金黄的海洋，沉重下垂，籽粒饱满的金色稻穗，间杂着一块块碧绿的藕塘和荸荠，早熟的小稻正在收割。大片的红芒稻就要登场，场里地里，人们忙着割、晒、打稻子，捆草把；稻场上落稻机的唔呜声应和着人们愉快的欢笑。合作社摆着十几架准备出贷的、油漆的红亮亮的落稻机。院子里挤满了登记贷款的农民，六百五十斤小米一架的落稻机，人们也不嫌贵。正如许多农民所说的：“真是少有的好年成”，丰收使农村的面貌改变了。
  土地改革前的三多
    土地改革前，六郎庄有三多：稻田多，佃户多，雇工多。全村旱地二百一十亩，稻田三千六百八十四亩。其中地主即占有稻田二千二百二十三亩。地主富农占全村稻田百分之七十五以上。该村有名的“二十四”士绅中的“夏五爷”夏锡儒等，不但霸占着良田，霸着水，且在海甸镇上开着大粮店“祥记”、“新兴元”；租出去的地秋天大斗收粮食，青黄不接时粮店里低价买青，高价卖粮，放高利贷。种大米的农民吃不起大米，换粗粮又得上“祥记”。六郎庄的农民就是在这样的层层剥削下失去了土地的。全村四百五十七户人家，雇农就占了二百一十户。他们一年到头忙，顾不上吃，买不下地，甚至租不起地。雇农刘金荣三辈子扛长活也没置下一亩地。他今年才四十岁，已经扛了二十三年活。爷儿俩前后秋天干一百天活，不够一家六口吃，秋后下了活就赶紧想法子奔吃，卖点白薯、小菜、背煤、刨荸荠。就这样混了几十年，几辈子。
  翻身农民刘金荣
    土地改革后，一切都变样了，正像刘金荣所说的：“从前真想不到这个日子！”土改中农民分到二、三三七亩稻田，一七六亩旱地，六万二千斤大米，四万四千多斤稻种，以及农具、房屋等，春夏努一把力，今年秋天光景就大不相同了。拿刘金荣来说，他分了九亩四分水地，种七亩稻子，二亩多荸荠。地是三等地，他说：“地是差些，也不能比人家少打，在地主手里只能打个一石八、九靠两石；我接过来，功夫勤，今年就打两石五，明年还要好。”他计算着自己的收成：七亩地打十七石五大米。稻梗上种的毛豆，今年收了二百八十斤。二亩荸荠长得好，比稻子还见钱，自己和兄弟出去打短，还挣了一千七百多斤老玉米，他说：“今年分了地，能吃饱了还使不清，打下粮食，要制点农具，换换衣掌，我爹，我家里的，我兄弟，还有我两个学生（指儿子），都得换，过年一刨荸荠，又有活钱了，添个斤褡裤褂，买点针线也好。”
    老刘在不久前刚搬进分给他的三间有大玻璃窗的明亮的民房。同时准备给他兄弟办喜事。现在刘金荣已被选为京郊农业劳模代表，正出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议。
    去年天旱时，该村水利管理委员会让刘金荣负责调节用水，他看水很尽心，还设法劝阻群众抢水，使全村稻田都得到灌溉。土改中他又在农会积极工作，入了党，被选为村政府生产委员。他和村里干部们一同在今年春天发动了群众修沟，捞蝗虫子，自己还随常不断的帮助别人抹埂、养苗、看水，他说：“我干活干了二十多年，也有了点经验，人家生产上有什么困难来跟我讨论，怎么来怎么去，我把自己知道的都告诉给他。我为大伙，大伙也知道我这份意思，比如我这回下水去拉闸板摔折了胳膊，一天二、三十家来看我，我的地人家一个钟点就给我薅好了。”这次他当选了京郊劳模代表，不住口的说：“从前我真想不到这个日子，过去就没到过这个地位。”回忆起过去受苦的日子，他说：“你说我们为什么不好好生产！过去没有地，吃不饱，今天毛主席给你几亩地叫你生产，再不好好生产，还吃不饱可就说不过去了，那怎么对得起毛主席呀！”
  去看毛主席
    六郎庄农民除了忙着收稻子外，还忙着另一件大事，十月一日村里有二百多人要进城参加国庆日示威游行，他们说：“正赶上地里忙，可是那也得去，去看毛主席呀！”
