Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 16th: General Kim Il-sung, Premier of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, delivered a radio address at 8 PM on September 9th to commemorate the second anniversary of the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Premier Kim Il-sung stated: Our young republic is a state system established by the Korean people themselves after our motherland was liberated from the colonial rule of Japanese imperialism by the military force of the great Soviet army. Although our republic has only a short history of two years, the achievements made in the great cause of building a democratic and independent country are enormous. Over the past two years, the republic has withstood the cruel test of constant infringements by domestic and foreign reactionaries headed by the American imperialist plunderers, and has built the northern half of the republic into a strong base for a democratic and independent country in terms of politics, economy, and culture. It has raised the international status of the republic, becoming an equal member in the ranks of freedom-loving nations around the world, and in the struggle against the new war-mongers—the American aggressors—it has gained the assistance and support of freedom-loving people all over the world.

The speech continued: From the first day of its establishment, the government of the republic has consistently adhered to the path of peaceful reunification in order to build a unified, democratic, and independent country. However, the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique responded to the Korean people's desire for peaceful reunification with sabotage, obstruction, and the slaughter of the Korean people. On June 25th of this year, they answered the two peaceful reunification proposals put forward by the Fatherland United Democratic Front by suddenly invading the northern half of the republic, provoking a civil war. The American imperialists have carried out armed aggression with land, sea, and air forces in order to conquer our motherland and people.

The report listed various facts of the American-Rhee reactionary clique launching the war, and for the first time excerpted secret letters between Syngman Rhee and his special envoy to Success Lake, Cho Byung-ok, and the American aggressor Robert. These letters further provide ironclad evidence of the crimes of the American-Rhee reactionary clique in launching the war.

The speech pointed out: For two months, the Korean people and their armed forces—the heroic People's Army—have achieved great results in the glorious Fatherland Liberation War to expel and eliminate the American imperialist armed invaders and the Syngman Rhee puppet army. Today, under the banner of the glorious Democratic People's Republic of Korea, nearly 95 percent of all regions of our motherland and approximately 97 percent of the total population of our motherland have been unified and united. There is no doubt that the still unliberated parts of Gyeongsangnam-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do and our compatriots in that region, groaning under the trampling of the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique and the American imperialist armed invaders, will be completely liberated. Various democratic reforms, similar to those already implemented in the northern half, are being carried out in the liberated areas of the south. These historic democratic reforms have gained the fervent support of the people in the liberated areas of the south. The people in the southern half, who once groaned under the reactionary police rule of the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee bandits, are joining the people in the northern half in participating in the Fatherland Liberation War and are working day and night to support the People's Army. Today, the glorious Korean People's Army is not only composed of the sons and daughters of the people of the northern half, but also of the sons and daughters of the people of the southern half. It is not only our honorable People's Army that is fighting against the American aggressors, but also our entire people.

The speech stated: The American aggressors are indiscriminately bombing our peaceful cities and towns and carrying out bestial strafing of peaceful residents. The American armed invaders have destroyed many factories and enterprises created by the sweat and blood of our people. However, the American armed invaders must know that the freedom, independence, and sovereignty of our Korean people cannot be destroyed or deprived. Our Korean people will never forget the atrocities of the American imperialists, and future generations will forever curse them.

The speech emphasized: The Korean people's Fatherland Liberation War against the armed aggression of American imperialism has entered the most brutal and decisive stage. The enemy has been compressed into a narrow area on the east coast bounded by Pohang to the south of Gyeongju, Yeongcheon to the north, Daegu and Changnyeong to the west, and Masan and Jinhae to the south. The enemy, surrounded on three sides, has only one way out, which is the Korea Strait. Therefore, in order to save themselves from their impending defeat, they have mobilized all their personnel and equipment and are resisting desperately. The speech called on the heroic officers and soldiers of the People's Army and the guerrillas to recognize this fact and launch an even more relentless struggle. It called on all the people in the rear to vigorously support the front lines, swiftly eliminate and expel the American armed aggressors and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique, and end the Fatherland Liberation War with a glorious victory.

　　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建国二周年
    金日成将军发表广播演说
    号召军民迅速消灭和驱逐美国侵略者  以光辉的胜利来完成祖国的解放事业
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首相金日成将军，于九月九日晚八时发表朝鲜民主主义人民共和国建国二周年纪念的广播演说。金日成首相称：我们年青的共和国，是我祖国由伟大苏军的武力从日本帝国主义殖民地统治中获得解放后朝鲜人民自己建立起来的国家制度。我共和国虽只有短短两年的历史，但在建设民主独立国家的伟业中所取得的成果是巨大的。两年来，共和国经受了以美帝国主义掠夺者为首的国内外反动派不断侵犯的残酷考验，将共和国北半部建设为民主独立国家的政治、经济、文化的强有力的基地。提高了共和国的国际地位，成为全世界爱好自由的民族行列中平等的一员，在反对新战争贩子——美国侵略者的斗争中，获得了全世界爱好自由人民的协助与声援。
    演说继称：共和国政府从成立的第一天起，为了建设统一的民主独立国家，曾一贯地坚持着和平统一路线。但是美帝国主义与李承晚卖国匪帮却以怠工、阻扰和对朝鲜人民的屠杀来回答朝鲜人民和平统一的愿望。今年六月二十五日，他们以突然侵犯共和国北半部地区，挑起内战来回答了祖国统一民主主义战线两度提出的和平统一方案。美帝国主义者为征服我祖国与人民，进行了陆海空军的武装侵略。
    报告列举了美李反动派发动战争的种种事实，并第一次摘引了李承晚与其驻成功湖特使赵炳玉及美国侵略分子罗伯特来往的秘密信件。这些信件进一步提供了美李反动派发动战争的铁案如山的罪证。
    演说指出：两个月来，朝鲜人民及其武装力量——英勇的人民军，在驱逐和消灭美帝国主义武装侵犯者和李承晚伪军的光荣祖国解放战争中，业已取得了巨大的成果。今天，在光荣的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的旗帜下，我祖国全部地区的近百分之九十五和我祖国总人口的约百分之九十七，已经统一、团结在一起了。毫无疑问，尚未解放的庆尚南、北道的部分地区和该地区呻吟在李承晚卖国匪帮与美帝国主义武装侵犯者蹂躏下的我们同胞兄弟姊妹们，将要完全获得解放。南半部解放区正在进行着各种和北半部业已实施的同样的民主改革。这种历史性的民主改革，获得了南半部解放区人民狂热的支持。曾呻吟在美帝国主义者和李承晚匪帮反动警察统治下的南半部人民，正和北半部人民一起参加着祖国的解放战争，夜以继日地进行着支援人民军的工作。今天光荣的朝鲜人民军不仅是由北半部人民的子弟所组成的，而且也是由南半部人民的子弟所组成的。为反对美国侵略者而作战的，不仅是我们荣誉的人民军队，而且也是我们全体人民。
    演说称：美国侵略者们对我国的和平城乡正滥施轰炸，对和平居民进行兽性的扫射。美国武装侵略者破坏了我国人民以血汗创造的很多工厂企业。但是，美国武装侵略者必须知道我们朝鲜人民的自由独立和自主权，是不能破坏和剥夺的。我们朝鲜人民永远不会忘记美帝国主义者的兽行，子孙万代将对他们永远诅咒。
    演说强调指出：朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义武装侵犯者的祖国解放战争，已进入了最残酷的决定的阶段。敌人已被压缩在东海岸方面以浦项以南庆州为界、北部以永川为界、西部以大邱、昌宁为界、南部以马山镇海为界的狭窄地区内。三面被包围的敌人，出路只有一条，就是朝鲜海峡。因此，他们为了挽救面临败亡的处境，动员了全部人员和装备，拚死反抗。演说号召英勇的人民军将士和游击队员认识这样的事实，展开更加无情的斗争。号召后方全体人民奋力支援前线，迅速消灭和驱逐美国武装侵略者及李承晚卖国匪帮，以光辉的胜利来结束祖国的解放战争。
