Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th. The million-plus citizens of Seoul, liberated for three months, are heroically resisting the invading American aggressors. Workers, students, women, and suburban farmers have all been mobilized, holding mass meetings and unanimously vowing to dedicate all their strength to support the People's Army in defending Seoul.

　　Workers in Seoul's factories are launching a "Creative Labor Achievement Movement" to produce more wartime materials to support the front lines. Workers voluntarily arrive early, inspect machinery, and organize shock brigades, completing their production quotas at two or three times the normal rate each day. Upon hearing the news that the American devils had landed in Incheon and were advancing on Seoul, the male and female workers immediately sent representatives to visit the garrison in the city, assuring the People's Army that they would intensify production to meet the needs of the front. In less than a week, they had presented the front lines with over 5,000 items of comfort goods and over 2,000 letters of consolation.

　　The pontoon bridge across the Han River is bombed and strafed by enemy aircraft almost daily, yet the young repair team members bravely repair it as soon as it is bombed, ensuring transportation across the Han River. Teams of young men and women are assisting the People's Army and the police in building fortifications in the suburbs. An endless stream of trucks and ox carts, loaded with ammunition and grain, are transporting supplies from all directions to the front lines; enemy flares, incendiary bombs, machine guns, and rocket launchers cannot frighten them. When the People's Army troops head to the front lines, the local people along the way automatically offer water and food, and offer sincere comfort. The soldiers gratefully say: "For the sake of the motherland and the people, we will fight to the last drop of blood and completely eliminate the American aggressors."

　　英勇阻击美国侵略者
    汉城人民在战斗中
    【新华社平壤二十六日电】解放了三个月的汉城百余万市民，正在英勇地阻击进犯的美国侵略者。工人、学生、妇女和郊区农民已全部动员起来，纷纷召开群众大会，一致宣誓献出全部力量，来支援人民军保卫汉城。
    汉城市各工厂的工人，为了生产更多的战时物资支援前线，正展开着“创造劳动功勋运动”。工人们自动地提早上班，检查机器，组织突击班，每天以两三倍的产量完成着自己的生产定额。男女工人们听到美国鬼子在仁川登陆进犯汉城的消息后，立即派代表访问市内的驻军，向人民军保证加紧生产，满足前线的需要。不到一个星期，他们已向前线献送了五千余件慰劳品与二千余封慰问信。
    汉江的便桥几乎每天被敌机炸射，然而青年复修队队员们奋不顾身地随炸随修，保障了汉江两岸的交通运输。一队一队的青年男女，正在协助人民军与警备队在城郊修筑工事。络绎不绝的卡车与牛车，装载着弹药与粮食从四面八方向前线运送，敌机的照明弹、烧夷弹、机关枪、火箭炮都吓不住他们。人民军部队开赴前线时，沿途老百姓自动地送水送饭，亲切地慰问。战士们感激地说：“为了祖国与人民，我们将战至最后一滴血，彻底消灭美国侵略者。”
