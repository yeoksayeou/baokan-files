　　Material Supply Work of State-Owned Industries
    Zhang Dadian
    The basic factor in the industrial production process is labor power. Besides labor power, the means of labor and the objects of labor are other factors in the production process. The expanded reproduction process is closely related to the expansion of the means of labor and the timely and sufficient supply of objects of labor. The effective function of the means of labor and the rational use of the objects of labor in production are the main conditions for maintaining the uninterrupted production of enterprises. At the same time, strengthening the supply of materials to enterprises, and accelerating the turnover of enterprise funds can also reduce costs, increase accumulation, and expand the effectiveness of industrial reproduction.
    Our state-owned industrial production is carried out according to production plans. On the one hand, the leading departments of state-owned industries should encourage enterprises to complete their plans. On the other hand, they should urge enterprises that have not completed their plans to seek further improvements. In terms of the economic significance of completing production plans, whether the industrial supply departments can supply the raw materials needed by each enterprise on time plays a certain role. Molotov said in his report on the eleventh anniversary of the Great October Revolution: "Increasing the speed of our economic development depends mostly on the rational organization of material supply, the creation of various material reserves, and the saving of state resources..." Failure to supply raw materials on time will directly affect the progress of production and will affect the promotion of production plans; if one unit is affected, other units will be similarly affected. Therefore, the planned supply of materials is indeed of great significance for improving industrial production and promoting the speed of industrial development.

  I. Formulating a Material Supply Plan
    The raw material supply plan is an important part of the industrial production plan and is the material basis for completing the product plan. Its content includes the material plan for production, the material plan for basic construction, and the material plan for major repairs.
    The material plan for production includes the basic materials, auxiliary materials, spare parts, and accessories required to complete production. Products are manufactured from these materials or with the participation of these materials. In the production process, basic materials are added to the products, such as raw materials, semi-finished products, dyes, etc. Auxiliary materials are consumed in the production process, such as fuel, lubricating oil, etc. Spare parts and accessories are replacement materials, such as oil cups, rolling mill rollers, machine parts, etc. When formulating the production material plan, it is necessary to carefully plan the timely supply of the main materials, because these materials are a determining factor in the production process.
    The distinction between basic construction and major repairs is that the former is construction that can create wealth, and the latter is to extend the life of the original wealth-creating structure, but the material plans for both belong to the nature of supply. Whether it is the new construction, restoration, renovation, or expansion of factories, it falls within the scope of the material supply plan, including the supply of building materials and the installation of machinery, power, and transportation equipment. The complete completion of basic construction and major repairs is the beginning of industrial production. We must not only pay attention to the supply of materials during the construction period, but also pay attention to the preparation of materials when entering the production process.
    The enterprise is the basic unit for preparing the material supply plan, and the implementation of the supply plan needs to be realized separately according to the different sources of materials and the division of labor in supply. Enterprises must prepare a material supply balance sheet according to the above three plans. From the balance sheet, we can understand the enterprise's total material requirements, know which materials need to be allocated, which materials need to be imported, which materials need to be stockpiled, how to accelerate turnover, and how to save foreign exchange. Then, we can compile a general supply balance sheet by integrating the balance sheets of each enterprise, which is the supply plan for the entire industry. According to the requirements of this general plan, we can further prepare the supply plan for self-produced materials, the domestic and foreign procurement plans, and the material reserve plan. Carry out inspection and supervision at any time according to the plan, overcome waste, avoid backlog, and ensure the timely supply and rational use of materials, improve the internal accumulation of industry, and consolidate the expanded reproduction of enterprises.

  II. Improving Material Supply Methods
    The planned supply of materials is an effective factor in accelerating the production cycle and promoting the speed of industrial development. To complete the supply and ensure production, we must pay attention to the soundness of the supply organization and the improvement of supply methods.
    1. Improve the supply organization. "The speed of our economic development depends to a large extent on the correct organization of material supply operations, the establishment of necessary material warehouses, and the economical use of national resources." (Molotov) We should establish a national material distribution bureau and supply general bureaus of various industrial departments, and improve the supply organizations of various professional bureaus and enterprises, so as to make them a perfect and strong organization and lay a solid foundation for the supply system. Supply organizations at all levels should establish close contact and cooperation with planning organizations at all levels, and compile material supply plans from bottom to top according to actual needs based on production plan figures, and carry out internal balance. The National Material Distribution Bureau formulates a national material distribution plan based on the supply balance sheets summarized by various departments, convenes various ordering meetings, concretely signs supply contracts, and guarantees the completion of the supply plan on schedule in accordance with the obligations stipulated in the contract. This correct structure of the supply organization is the main key to realizing the planned supply of materials.
    2. Organize unified supply. Material supply is a relatively complex work process, and it is necessary to cooperate closely and organize unified supply with emphasis as early as possible within the scope possible, with production as the center, and create all conditions conducive to production. Supply agencies and production enterprises should establish close contact, cooperate with each other, divide the scope of unified supply of supply organizations at all levels, and distribute systematically and step by step according to the plan, so that "various economic departments of the central government and local economic departments can give full play to their creativity and enthusiasm under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government."
    The economic significance of unified material supply lies in: First, enterprises will not compete to purchase materials individually in the market, which can stabilize prices. Second, enterprises will not abuse fake and inferior materials, which can ensure product quality. Third, avoid overlapping organizations, which can save manpower; avoid over-standard reserves, which can save funds. Fourth, promote enterprises to strengthen economic accounting, facilitate planning of appropriate amounts of working capital, and save foreign exchange.
    3. Establish material warehouses. The supply leading agencies of various industrial departments must gradually purchase and store a certain amount of main materials as a regular reserve of the warehouse according to the material requirements of each enterprise's production, the different sources of materials, the early and late arrival of materials, and the length of the interval for continuous production materials, and allocate them at any time according to the material plan of each enterprise. And on the basis of the national warehouse inventory, focus on establishing warehouses in industrial areas. The establishment of material warehouses can understand the material usage of enterprises at any time, grasp the actual situation of enterprise production, and maintain close working relations with finished product warehouses. According to the shipping plan of the sales department and the material plan of the enterprise where it is located, a certain amount of main materials and regionally frequently used materials are regularly stored, so that each enterprise can meet its material requirements at any time. This can not only ensure the normal progress of production, but also reduce the enterprise's own material reserves to a minimum.
    4. Take care of private enterprises. "To enable various social and economic components to cooperate and cooperate under the leadership of the state-owned economy, so as to promote the development of the entire social economy." In order to implement the above spirit, it is obvious that the material supply task must not only complete the supply of state-owned enterprises, but also focus on organizing private enterprises within the scope of supply. According to the needs of private enterprises for processing and ordering materials and production materials, we should coordinate as much as possible, so that private enterprises can get a certain amount of allocation of the main raw materials they need in order to supply them in time and complete production.
    5. Strictly formulate contract credit system. The material supply plan is realized through a series of contracts. Whether it is the supply of self-produced materials, the supply of purchased materials, or the supply of materials between public and private enterprises, it must be systematically organized according to the basic organizational form of general contract, partial contract, and specific contract, and clearly stipulate the conditions for the performers of obligations. Once the contract is signed, it should be regarded as law, strictly observed, and conscientiously implemented. Both the supplier and the demander guarantee to deliver the goods on time, pay on time, and guarantee that the specifications and quality meet the standards. It is best to achieve a regular shipping system, so that the contract becomes an effective actual document. Internal continuous production materials of the enterprise should also sign workshop contracts to supply semi-finished products and re-products on time. In this way, material supply according to the plan can guarantee production and avoid blindness and disconnection between production and supply.
    6. Inventory inventory materials. The correct measure of the national warehouse material inventory work has given the supply work a great favorable condition. On this basis, we should establish the inspection work of warehouse economy, and make a precise inspection of the nature of all raw materials in the enterprise warehouse. In the inspection process, all inventory materials can be thoroughly inventoried, and unusable cold materials after production changes can be found, and unnecessary or surplus materials can be properly handled. The industrial leading agencies can thereby understand the entire situation of the inventory materials of each enterprise, which is convenient for unified control and allocation. Materials that are useless for this enterprise can participate in production in another enterprise, and materials that are not used by various central departments can also be handed over for unified allocation according to plan. This plays a great role in promoting the joint advancement of the entire industrial construction. After this work is completed, it is also necessary to strengthen the inspection of incoming materials and regular warehouse inspections to prevent materials that do not meet the quality standards from being stockpiled in the warehouse for a long time.
    7. Formulate material consumption quotas. The supply plan should be formulated according to the actual needs of each enterprise. If the actual situation of both supply and demand is not grasped, the plan will fail and will be divorced from reality. Therefore, the supply agency must strengthen the investigation and research work of the supply business, and actively participate in the production plan and the formulation of material consumption quotas. The advanced average quota of material consumption is formulated on the basis of the planned quota and based on the actual consumption of unit products. It is a scientific basis for formulating production plans and material supply plans, submitting applications and order forms, and also an indicator for supervising and inspecting material consumption and investigating whether it is saving or wasting. We use the instructions of this indicator to revise the supply plan and the reserve plan, so that the material supply plan can be accurately realized.

  III. Accelerating the Turnover of Material Funds
    In enterprises that have started production, raw materials belong to the scope of working capital, and they participate in each production process in a cycle. Raw materials are continuously made into finished products through the processing of workers, realized sales, and the recovered currency is used to repurchase raw materials and continue processing and production. The speed of the material cycle participating in the production cycle is directly proportional to the number of products it can provide. We can see the economic significance of accelerating the turnover supply of materials from the following table.

Item                       Unit    Investment Amount Three turnovers per year Four turnovers per year Five turnovers per year Six turnovers per year  Comparison of accelerated turnover amount         Million yuan  120 360       480       600       720   Comparison of the amount of steel plates supplied by accelerated turnover Hundred kilograms  200 600       800       1,000    1,200   Comparison of investment savings from accelerated turnover   Million yuan  720 240       180       140        120

    Note: Steel plate is 6,000 yuan per kilogram

    As shown in the table above, we can see:
    1. With an investment of 120 million yuan, if three turnovers are completed in a year, 360 million yuan of raw materials can be supplied. If the turnover is accelerated to six times, 720 million yuan of raw materials can be supplied. That is to say, the more the number of turnovers, the greater the amount of raw materials supplied.
    2. The original working capital of 120 million yuan can purchase 20,000 kilograms of steel plates. If three turnovers are completed in a year, 60,000 kilograms of steel plates can be supplied. If the turnover is accelerated to six times, the supply can be doubled to 120,000 kilograms. That is to say, it can increase the industrial production by one times the product to serve the society.
    3. Enterprises need a raw material supply of 720 million yuan to ensure production. If three turnovers are completed in a year, an investment of 240 million yuan is required. If six turnovers are completed in a year, only an investment of 120 million yuan is required to ensure the production task. That is to say, the faster the material turnover, the smaller the investment in material supply.
    It can be seen that under the guarantee of the same production task, the department responsible for and planning the supply of raw materials can reduce the huge investment of enterprises in materials as long as it rationally uses funds and accelerates its turnover, so that it can be used for the task of increasing production and increasing manufacturing and power equipment. expand the scope of production. At this point, the economic significance of accelerating the turnover of material supply is very clear, mainly lies in investing the minimum amount of working capital to realize the process of expanded reproduction; so that in today's difficult financial environment, the speed of construction can be increased with a small number of economic resources.

  IV. Material Supply and Economic Accounting System
    The purpose of the economic accounting system is to reduce product costs and increase enterprise accumulation in every possible way. It is a management method for plannedly accelerating the turnover of funds and promoting the planning of supply to carry out and implement economic accounting in material supply enterprises, that is, an operation method of completing a large amount of supply with the least amount of monetary funds.
    The signing of the material supply contract and the material responsibility it bears is a strong material guarantee for the completion of the national material plan and the consolidation of the economic accounting system, and is a means for both the supplier and the purchaser to implement financial supervision. After the contract is signed, the production enterprise can safely consider the organization of its production capacity, discover industrial potential capacity, and improve the rational use of raw materials and fuels to reduce costs and increase profits. The supply enterprise considers the turnover and use of its funds, how to shorten the procurement cycle, strengthen transportation management, and complete the supply task by delivering goods in time. Lenin wrote: "The joint company and enterprises should be based on economic accounting, that is, to ensure that they themselves guarantee that their own enterprises will not suffer losses."
    Financial supervision in the economic accounting work of enterprises is realized through the financial and credit system. In today's difficult financial and economic situation, it is necessary to flexibly use working capital, and use a small amount of supply funds to achieve the effect of multiple turnovers to ensure the normal supply of raw materials. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to establish a normal credit relationship with the National Bank, which can not only avoid the accumulation of the enterprise's own currency, but also make up for the defects of inflexible supply fund turnover, and can achieve the goal of improving supply work through the supervisory role of the bank.
    Strengthening material procurement work is of great significance for implementing economic accounting. Supply enterprises should regularly understand and grasp the storage and sales of market equipment, and use market storage to replace the accumulation of their own funds; and pay attention to market changes and the use of materials in the production season; study the supply and demand relationship in foreign markets and the reasons for changes in foreign market conditions, consider the time of foreign orders, shorten the interval of incoming materials, and pay more attention to the quality standards of foreign manufacturers and the credit of exporters in the complex situation of international trade. After investigations and studies in various aspects, various main equipment can be purchased and supplied at any time according to the production cycle. And you can use remittance, discount, futures trading and other methods to seek smooth turnover of procurement funds.
    In addition, the organization of transportation work and the mechanization of loading and unloading work, the timely and rapid clearing of accounts between various enterprises; and the simplification of internal procedures, material inspection, safety insurance, customs declaration and tax payment, etc., are closely related to the supply of equipment, and should be paid attention to at any time. Closely cooperate to save manpower and material resources and supply on time. So that the production and distribution of industry will not be unnecessarily hindered by subtle problems.

　　国营工业的材料供应工作
    张大巅
    工业生产过程的基本因素是劳动力，除劳动力外，劳动手段和劳动对象，就是生产过程的另外一些因素，扩大再生产过程与劳动手段的扩充和劳动对象及时而充分的供应是息息相关的。劳动手段机能的发挥与劳动对象在生产中的合理使用，是保持企业的生产不致中断的主要条件。同时，加强对企业材料的供应，与加速企业资金的周转还可以收减低成本，增加积累，扩大工业再生产的成效。
    我们的国营工业生产，是根据生产计划而进行的。国营工业领导部门一方面要鼓励企业完成计划，一方面要督促未完成计划的企业进一步求得改进。在完成生产计划的经济意义上，工业供应部门能否按时供应各企业所需用的原材料，是起着一定的作用。莫洛托夫在伟大的十月革命第十一周年报告中曾说过：“提高我们经济发展的速度多半要依靠于组织合理的材料供应，创造各种的物质后备，以及节省国家的资源……”原材料不能按时供应，会直接影响生产的进行，并会影响到生产计划的推动；一个单位受到影响，其它单位也会同样受到牵动。所以器材供应计划化对提高工业生产，促进工业发展速度，确实具有重要的意义。
  一、制定材料供应计划
    原材料供应计划是工业生产计划重要之一环，是完成产品计划的物质基础。它的内容包括生产的用料计划，基本建设的用料计划与大修理的用料计划。
    生产的用料计划包括为完成生产所需用的基本材料，补助材料，备品与配件，生产品即由这些材料或在这些材料的参与之下制造而成。在生产过程中，基本材料便加入生产品中，如原料，半制品，染料等属之。补助材料便消耗于生产过程中，如燃料，滑油等属之。备品与配件，是属于更换的器材，如油盅，轧钢滚子，机器零件等属之。在制定生产用料计划时，必需周密计划主要材料的及时供应，因为这些材料在生产过程中是决定因素的一种。
    基本建设与大修理的划分，前者为能创造财富的建设，后者为使原创造财富的构成得以延长，但两者的用料计划，则同属于供应性质。无论工厂的新建，恢复，改造及扩充，均属于材料供应计划的范围，它包括建筑材料的供应与机器动力运输等设备的按装。基本建设及大修理的全部完成，便是工业生产的开始，我们不但要注意建设时期用料的供应，还要注意进入生产过程时的用料准备。
    企业是编制材料供应计划的基本单位，而供应计划的执行，则需根据材料的不同来源与供应的分工而分别实现。企业必需按照以上的三种计划，编制材料供应平衡表。我们从平衡表上可以了解企业的全部用料要求，可以知道那些材料需要调拨？那些材料需要进口？那些材料需要储备？如何加速周转？怎样节省外汇？再将各企业平衡表综合起来，编制总供应平衡表，便是整个工业的供应计划。根据这一总计划表的要求，进而编制自产材料的供应计划，国内国外的采购计划，器材的储备计划。按照计划随时进行检查监督，克服浪费，避免积压，才能保证器材的按时供应与合理运用，提高工业的内部积累，巩固企业的扩大再生产。
  二、改进材料供应方法
    材料供应计划化，是加速生产周期，促进工业发展速度之有效因素。要完成供应，保证生产，须注意供应组织的健全，与供应方法的改进。
    １、健全供应组织。“我们经济发展的速度，大部分是靠材料补给业务的正确组织，必需材料库的创设和国家资源之经济的利用。”（莫洛托夫）我们应当成立国家的物资分配局与各工业部的供应总局，并健全各专业局和企业的供应组织，使之成为完善而坚强的机构，打下供应系统的巩固基础。各级供应组织应与各级计划组织取得紧密的联系与配合，依据生产的计划数字，由下而上的按照实际需要逐级编造材料供应计划，进行内部平衡。国家的物资分配局根据了各部汇总的供应平衡表，制定出全国的物资分配计划，召开各种订货会议，具体的签订供应合同，按照合同规定的义务，保证供应计划的如期完成。供应组织的这样正确构成，是实现材料供应计划化的主要关键。
    ２、组织统筹供应。材料供应是一个比较复杂的工作过程，必须通力合作，在可能范围内及早组织有重点的统筹供应，以生产为中心，创造一切有利于生产的条件。供应机关与生产企业要取得紧密联系，互相配合，划分各级供应组织统筹供应的范围，按照计划作有系统有步骤的分配，以便使“中央各经济部门和地方各经济部门在中央人民政府统一的领导之下，各自发挥其创造性和积极性”。
    材料统筹供应的经济意义，在于：第一，各企业不致个别在市场上竞购器材，可以稳定物价。第二，各企业不致滥用赝品次料，可以保证产品质量。第三，避免组织重叠，可以节省人力；避免超标准储备，可以节省资金。第四，促使企业加强经济核算，便于计划适当数额的流动资金，并可节省外汇。
    ３、建立材料仓库。各工业部的供应领导机关，必须根据各个企业生产用料的要求，不同的材料来源，进料期的迟早，连续生产用料间隔的长短，逐渐购存一定数量的主要器材，作为仓库的经常储备，按照各企业的用料计划随时调拨。并应在全国仓库清查的基础上，重点的建立起工业区域的仓库。材料仓库的建立，可以随时了解企业的用料情形，掌握企业生产的实际状况，经常与成品仓库取得密切的工作联系，根据销售部门的发货计划与所在企业的用料计划，经常储备一定数量的主要器材和带有地区性的经常需用的材料，使各企业能随时满足其用料要求，这样既可保证生产的正常进行，又可缩减企业自身的材料储备到最小限度。
    ４、照顾私营企业。“使各种社会经济成份在国营经济领导之下，分工合作，各得其所，以促进整个社会经济的发展。”为了贯彻上述精神，很显然的，材料供应任务，不但要完成国营企业的供应，同时要把私营企业有重点的组织在供应范围以内。按照私营企业加工订货用料与生产用料的需要，尽可能的统筹兼顾，使私营企业对于所需主要原材料得到一定数量的分配，以便及时供应，完成生产。
    ５、严订合同信用制。材料供应计划要通过一系列的合同来实现，无论自产材料的供应，采购材料的供应，公私企业相互用料的供应，都要有系统的按照物资分配计划，经过总体合同，局部合同，具体合同的基本组织形式，明确规定义务履行者的条件。合同一经签定，便应视同法律，严格遵守，认真执行。供需双方保证按期交货，按期付款，保证规格质量符合标准，最好作到按期的发货制度，使合同成为有效的实际文件。企业内部的连续生产用料，也应签订车间合同，按时供应半成品与再制品。这样按照计划进行材料供应，便可保证生产，避免生产与供应的盲目与脱节。
    ６、清查库存物资。全国仓库物资清查工作这一正确的措施，给了供应工作以很大的有利条件，我们应在此基础上，建立起仓库经济的检查工作，就企业仓库中所有原材料的性质，作一精密的检查。在检查过程中，可以使全部库存物资得到彻底的清点，生产变动后，不适用的冷料能够发现，不需要或过剩的材料得到适当的处理。工业的领导机关从而可以了解各个企业库存材料的全部情况，便于统一掌握与调配。使这一企业无用的材料到另一企业参加生产，中央各部不用的材料，也可有计划的上缴作统一的调配。这对整个工业建设共同向前推进上是起着很大的作用的。这一工作完成之后，还需加强进料的检验工作与经常的仓库检查工作，以杜绝质量标准不合规格的材料在仓库中的长期积压。
    ７、制定材料消费定额。供应计划应根据各个企业的实际需要来制定，掌握不住供需双方的实际情况，计划就会落空，就会与实际脱节。所以供应机关必需加强供应业务的调查研究工作，积极参加生产计划与制定材料消费定额。材料消费的先进平均定额，是以计划定额为基础，以单位产品的实际消耗量为根据而制定的。它是制定生产计划与材料供应计划，提出申请书和定货单的科学根据，也是监督与检查材料耗用量，究明节约还是浪费的指标。我们根据这一指标的指示来修正供应计划与储备计划，才能够使器材供应计划准确的实现。
  三、加速材料资金的周转
    在开工生产的企业中，原材料是属于流动资金的范围，它循环的参加于每个生产过程。原材料经过工人的加工，不断的制出成品，实现销售，以收回的货币再重新购买原材料，继续加工生产。材料的循环参加于生产周期的快慢，与其所能提供的产品数量成正比。我们从下表便可看出材料加速周转供应的经济意义。项别                       单位    投资额 一年周转三次 一年周转四次 一年周转五次 一年周转六次加速周转的金额比较         百万元  一二○ 三六○       四八○       六○○       七二○加速周转供出钢板的数量比较 百公斤  二○○ 六○○       八○○       一、○○○    一、二○加速周转节省投资额的比较   百万元  七二○ 二四○       一八○       一四○        一二○
    注：钢板每公斤六、○○○元
    如上表所示，我们可以看出：
    一、一亿二千万元的投资，一年中完成三次周转时，可以供应三亿六千万元的原材料，如加速周转至六次，则可供应七亿二千万元的原材料。也就是说周转的次数愈多，则供应原材料的数量愈大。
    二、原用流动资金一亿二千万元可购钢板二万公斤，一年中完成三次周转时，可以供应钢板六万公斤，如加速周转至六次，则可增加一倍的供应量至十二万公斤。也就是说可以增加工业生产一倍的产品去服务社会。
    三、企业需以七亿二千万元的原材料供应量去保障生产，一年中完成三次周转，则需投资二亿四千万元，若一年完成六次周转，则只需投资一亿二千万元，即可保证生产任务。也就是说材料周转愈快对于材料供应上的投资亦愈小。
    由此可见在保证同一生产任务之下，负责和筹划原材料供应的部门只要合理的运用资金、加速其周转，就可以减少企业在材料上的巨大投资，使之转用于增产的任务，增加制造和动力设备，扩大生产的范围。于此，材料供应加速周转的经济意义便很了然，主要是在于投下最小限度的流动资金，实现扩大再生产的过程；得以在今天财政困难的环境下，以少数的经济资源，提高建设的速度。
  四、材料供应与经济核算制
    经济核算制的目的，是以一切方法降低产品成本，增加企业积累。在材料供应的企业中贯彻与施行经济核算，是有计划的加速资金周转，促进供应计划化的管理方法，也就是花费最少的货币资金完成多量供应的经营方法。
    材料供应合同的签订及其所负的物质责任，对于完成国家物资计划与巩固经济核算制度，是一个有力的物质保证，是供应和购买者双方互相实行财政监督的手段。生产企业于合同签订之后，可以放心的去考虑其生产能力的组织，发现工业潜在能力，改善原材料、燃料合理的利用，以降低成本提高利润。供应企业则考虑其资金的周转与运用，如何缩短采购周期，加强运输管理，及时发货完成供应任务。列宁写道：“联合公司和企业的要以经济核算为基础，就是为了使得它们自己保证，而且是完全保证自己企业的不受亏损。”
    对于企业经济核算工作中的财政监督，是经过财政和信贷系统实现的。在今天财政经济困难的情况下，需要灵活运用流动资金，以少数的供应资金，收多次周转的效果来保证原材料的正常供应。欲达此目的，就要与国家银行建立起正常的信贷关系，既可避免企业自身货币的积压，又可弥补供应资金周转不灵的缺陷，并可经过银行的监督作用，达到改善供应工作的目的。
    材料采购工作的加强，对实行经济核算有着重要的意义。供应企业要经常了解与掌握市场器材的存储量和销售情况，利用市场的存储代替自身资金的积压；并注意市场情况的变动与生产季节用料的状况；研究国外市场的供求关系与国外市场情况变动的原因，考虑国外订购的时间，缩短进料的间隔，在国际贸易复杂的情况下更需注意国外生产厂家的质量标准与出口商的信用程度。经过各方面的调查研究，才能按照生产周期，随时采购供应各种主要的器材。并可利用押汇、贴现、期货交易等方式，以谋采购资金圆滑的周转。
    此外运输工作的组织化与装卸工作的机械化，各企业间账户及时而迅速的清算；以及内部各种手续的简化，器材检验，安全保险，报关纳税等问题，都与器材供应发生密切的关联，应随时注意，密切配合，以求节省人力物力，按时供应。使工业的生产与分配，不致因细微的问题，发生不必要的阻碍。
