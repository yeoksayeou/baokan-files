　　Seeing Off Heroes to Beijing
    Lu Gong
    An old woman of eighty steps out of her door,
    Children squeeze into the crowd…
    Happier than even the New Year,
    Singing songs of Chairman Mao to see off the heroes.
　
    The old woman is like a mother,
    Touching the big red flower on the hero's chest,
    Her eyes narrow and she smiles:
    “Give Chairman Mao my regards…”
　
    The children call to their parents,
    Wanting the hero to give them a hug,
    Opening their little mouths to say:
    “Dad, Mom, wait until we grow up…”
　
    The young people are like brothers,
    Saluting the heroes.
    Shaking hands, smiling and saying:
    “We must learn from you!”
　
    Seeing off heroes to Beijing,
    Everyone's heart blooms with fresh flowers:
    “Give our regards to Chairman Mao,
    Bring back Chairman Mao’s words to tell us…”

　　欢送英雄上北京
    路工
    八十老婆婆出大门，
    小孩子挤在人当中……
    比上过年还欢喜，
    唱着毛主席送英雄。
　
    老婆婆像妈妈，
    摸着英雄胸前大红花，
    眼睛一眯笑开啦：
    “给毛主席捎上两句话……”
　
    小孩子叫爸妈，
    要英雄抱一下，
    张开小嘴说出话：
    “爸，妈，等咱长大……”
　
    年青人如兄弟，
    向英雄行敬礼。
    拉拉手，笑笑说：
    “要向你们好好学！”
　
    欢送英雄上北京，
    人人心中开鲜花：
    “见了毛主席问个好，
    带回毛主席话来告给咱……”
