　　World's Youth Unite
　　——Welcome the Delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth
　　The delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth arrived in Beijing yesterday. The youth representatives from thirty-two countries, in addition to visiting our capital and participating in our nation's first National Day celebration since its founding, also plan to visit many places. They will have extensive contact with the people and youth of our country. This is indeed welcome news.
　　In the great struggle against imperialism and in defense of lasting world peace, the Chinese people are strongly united with the people of all countries; the relationship between Chinese youth and the democratic youth of all countries is the same. This delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth visiting China has different skin colors, different beliefs, and lives on different lands, but is engaged in the same resolute struggle to defend peace. Such a large-scale international unity is a vivid proof of the vast strength of the forces of peace.
　　The world-scale movement to defend peace is entering an unprecedented historical climax. In this movement, the World Federation of Democratic Youth is an important force. Since its establishment five years ago, it has continuously condemned the warmongers, exposed the imperialist conspiracies to prepare for war, and called on young people to defend peace with action. Especially in recent months, under the call of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, democratic youth of all countries have participated in and promoted the peace signature campaign with unparalleled enthusiasm, and have actively supported the heroic struggle of the Korean people against the American aggressors. The World Federation of Democratic Youth's active activities and just struggle in defending peace for the past five years have earned it a high reputation among the democratic youth masses of various countries and have continuously expanded its ranks. Its membership has increased from 30 million youth in sixty-four countries in 1945 to 70 million youth in seventy-four countries at present.
　　Now, in Asia and even the world, we are at an important period in the struggle between peace and war. American imperialism is carrying out a war of aggression in Korea, slaughtering the Korean people, destroying the peaceful towns and villages of Korea, and also barbarously invading our country's Taiwan and strafing our compatriots, while at the same time stepping up preparations for expanding the war. This sinful act of the American reactionaries is intolerable to the Chinese people and youth, and is also intolerable to the people of all countries and the young peace fighters of all countries. The young peace fighters of all countries coming to China this time is a great assembly of peace forces and a great demonstration against the American imperialist aggressors. We welcome the visit of the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and we celebrate that this visit strengthens the close unity of the youth of all countries and the youth of China in the struggle, and strengthens the power of the world's people to strive for peace.

　　世界青年团结起来
    ——欢迎世界民主青联代表团
    世界民主青联代表团昨天来到北京了。三十二个国家的青年代表，除了访问我国首都，参加我国开国以来的第一个国庆以外，还计划访问许多地方，他们和我国人民和青年将要有广泛的接触。这确是一个值得欢迎的喜讯。
    在反对帝国主义、保卫世界持久和平的伟大斗争中，中国人民与世界各国人民是坚强地团结在一起的；中国青年与各国民主青年之间的关系，也是一样。这次访问中国的世界民主青联代表团，有着不同的肤色，不同的信仰，生活在不同的土地上，但是进行着同一的保卫和平的坚决斗争。这样浩大规模的国际团结，正是和平力量广大强壮的生动证明。
    世界规模的保卫和平运动正进入历史上空前的高潮。在这个运动中，世界民主青联是重要的力量之一。它成立五年以来，曾不断指责战争贩子，揭露帝国主义准备战争的阴谋，号召青年用行动来保卫和平。尤其最近几个月，在世界民主青联的号召下，各国民主青年以无比的热情参加与推动着和平签名运动，并积极支持着朝鲜人民反对美国侵略者的英勇战斗。世界民主青联五年来保卫和平的积极活动与正义斗争，使它在各国民主青年群众中享有很高的威信，并不断扩大着自己的队伍。它的会员人数已从一九四五年的六十四个国家的三千万青年，增加到目前的七十四个国家的七千万青年。
    现在，在亚洲以至于全世界，正处于和平与战争搏斗的重要时期。美帝国主义在朝鲜进行着屠杀朝鲜人民的侵略战争，毁灭着朝鲜的和平城镇与乡村，而且横暴地侵略我国的台湾，扫射我国的同胞，同时还加紧着扩大战争的准备。美国反动派的这种罪恶行为，是中国人民和青年所决不能容忍的，也是世界各国人民和各国的青年和平战士所决不能容忍的。世界各国的青年和平战士们这次来到中国，是和平力量的一次大会师，也是对美帝国主义侵略者的一个大示威。我们欢迎世界民主青联代表团的访问，并且庆祝这一访问加强各国青年与中国青年在战斗中的紧密团结，加强世界人民争取和平的力量。
