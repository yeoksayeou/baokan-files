　　Resolutely Oppose Commandism

    The rectification movements in various regions have proven that the relatively common problem in our cadres' work style is commandism. Many comrades have already resolved to correct this problem, which is good. However, some comrades have not yet fully understood the harm of commandism; or, having committed the mistake of commandism, are unwilling to correct it and have even fabricated many reasons to defend it. This phenomenon must be overcome.

    Every one of our Communist Party members and cadres must constantly remember our Communist Party's constitution and Comrade Mao Zedong's basic instructions regarding the Party's work style. The General Program of the Party Constitution stipulates: "The Communist Party of China must constantly guard against the danger of being divorced from the masses of the people, and must constantly pay attention to preventing and cleaning up the erroneous tendencies within itself of tailism, commandism, closed-doorism, bureaucratism, and warlordism, which are divorced from the masses." The Party Constitution stipulates that the duty of a Party member is to "serve the people, consolidate the connection between the Party and the masses, understand and promptly reflect the needs of the masses, and explain the Party's policies to the masses." In his report to the Seventh National Congress of the Party, Comrade Mao Zedong emphatically told us: "In all work, commandism is wrong. Because it exceeds the level of consciousness of the masses, violates the principle of voluntariness of the masses, and suffers from impatience." Every Party member and cadre should, according to the standards of the Party Constitution and Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, examine their own work and raise their own awareness.

    For many years, the majority of our Party members and cadres, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, have served the people wholeheartedly, struggled arduously, and achieved the great victory of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution. This has benefited the people and cannot be denied. However, we also cannot deny that some comrades have not completely acted according to the Party Constitution and Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, and often still intentionally or unintentionally commit the mistake of commandism. Today, as the revolution has achieved basic victory throughout the country, our Party has grown even more. At this time, some of the older Party members and older cadres inevitably become arrogant and complacent, look down on the masses, and fuel the erroneous tendency of commandism; some of the new Party members and new cadres are influenced by the work style of the Kuomintang, and others do not know how to follow the mass line. They are all very likely to adopt the bad style of commandism to treat the masses, ruining many correct policies and good deeds that represent the interests of the masses. If this commandist work style is allowed to develop, it will be extremely harmful to the people and the revolutionary cause. All comrades who are loyal to the people and loyal to the revolution should consciously rise up and resolutely oppose and overcome this commandist work style. All defenses of the commandist work style are completely wrong.

    Some people say: "My ordering the masses is to implement the laws and decrees of the People's Government." But the laws and decrees of the People's Government and the commandism with which commandists treat the masses are completely unrelated and fundamentally different. The commandist's coercion of the masses is not truly implementing the laws and decrees of the People's Government, but violating them. The laws and decrees of the People's Government represent and protect the interests of the vast majority of the people. It can and should implement coercive methods against the illegal acts of a minority who violate the interests of the vast majority of the people. But commandism is something of a different nature. Commandists do not act according to the actual situation and the level of consciousness of the masses, do not carry out mobilization and explanation work to the masses, but adopt simple and crude methods to force the masses to accept things that they cannot accept. Some of these things fundamentally violate the interests of the masses, so the masses cannot accept them at all; some, although to some extent represent the interests of a part of the masses, are unacceptable to another part of the masses; some, even if they fully represent the interests of the masses, cannot be accepted temporarily due to the limitations of the general level of consciousness of the masses. In short, commandism, no matter what circumstances it arises in, is wrong. Even in order to implement the laws and decrees of the People's Government, no one has the right to coerce the masses. Because only the illegal acts of lawbreakers can be sanctioned by law enforcement agencies according to law. The laws and decrees of the People's Government are a concentration of the opinions of the masses and come from the masses. But the opinions of the masses are often scattered and piecemeal. When these opinions are concentrated and become laws and decrees, they are different from the initially scattered and piecemeal opinions of the masses. When we implement these laws and decrees, when these laws and decrees return to the masses, we must carry out explanation work to the masses, and we must never use simple and crude methods to force the masses to implement them. Lenin said in his report on rural work at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party: "The decrees are basically correct. We have no basis to refuse or regret any of them. But although the decrees are correct, it is incorrect to use force to force the peasants to accept them. Nothing in any decree has ever said that." Isn't that clear enough?

    Some people say: "The tasks are urgent and heavy, and we cannot act according to policy, so we can only force and order." This statement is also wrong. Policy and tasks are by no means opposed. Our various policies are formulated based on the highest interests of the vast majority of the people; our task is to ensure the realization of the highest interests of the vast majority of the people. Only by correctly implementing the policies can we complete the task; violating the policies makes it impossible to complete the task. Implementing policies and completing tasks is the sacred duty of every revolutionary cadre who serves the people wholeheartedly. To correctly implement each policy and to complete each work task, leading organs and cadres and Party members at all levels must carry out arduous work of educating and persuading the masses, and must act according to the mass line. Even if the task is sometimes urgent, as long as leading organs and cadres and Party members at all levels have carried out the education and explanation of basic policies to the masses in normal times, on the basis of the consciousness and voluntariness of the masses, the masses will also be able to accept our call at any time and jointly complete urgent tasks. Some of the shortcomings and errors that occurred in the past in the implementation of so-called "urgent and heavy" tasks were partly due to the fact that some leading organs formulated policies carelessly, arranged work incompletely, and did not provide sufficient specific assistance to lower levels; but a large part was also due to the fact that the cadres who implemented the tasks disregarded policies and did not follow the mass line. Some cadres even say that beating and scolding people is to complete the task. Can this be believed? There are even individual cadres who boast about how they "completed the task" by using coercion and command. Shouldn't this be deeply reviewed? Cadres who have made such mistakes should unconditionally apologize to the masses and admit their mistakes, and resolve to correct their errors.

    "You have to force the masses if you want something from them; you don't have to force them only when you give them something." This is another extremely wrong statement. This is a reflection of the Kuomintang ideology and Kuomintang work style that some staff members have been infected with. People who have this kind of thinking and work style do not understand at all that all our efforts for the cause of the Chinese people's revolution and construction are for the benefit of the masses of the people. The masses of the people contribute people, labor, and money to support the cause of revolution and construction, and they understand that this is for their own benefit. Only when the masses of the people understand this truth will they consciously "take out things" and even contribute their lives when necessary. In our country's long revolutionary war in the past, the countless moving deeds of the broad masses of the people have already provided us with the most powerful proof. We have always put the interests of the masses first, from the long-term interests of the masses to their daily living interests. We have never relaxed our care for the daily living interests of the masses and have actively helped the masses overcome difficulties. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his speech on "Get Organized" long ago: "If our comrades who do local work are divorced from the masses, do not understand the emotions of the masses, cannot help the masses organize production, improve their lives, and only know how to ask them for patriotic public grain, but do not know how to first use ninety percent of their energy to help the masses solve their 'private grain for saving the people' and then use only ten percent of their energy to solve the public grain for saving the country, then this is infected with the Kuomintang work style, infected with the dust of bureaucratism." From this, it can be seen that it is completely unreasonable to oppose the so-called "asking the masses for things" and "giving things to the masses" in order to defend the error of commandism towards the masses.

    Some people also say: "The masses are too backward, and it won't work without coercion and command." This is exaggerating some backward phenomena of individual masses as an excuse to cover up their own mistakes. Since we are serving the masses of the people, our primary responsibility is to patiently educate the masses and raise their political consciousness. As long as the political consciousness of the masses is generally raised, individual backward phenomena can be overcome; even if it is temporarily impossible to completely overcome them, we must still continue to patiently educate and persuade them, and we should not abandon education and persuasion work and adopt crude commandist methods. For example, it is an extremely obvious fact that beating and scolding people, even if it makes people afraid, will never convince them. Because beating and scolding are by no means education. Some people say, "I don't beat good people, I beat bad people." This is even more of a self-deceiving excuse. If there are indeed individual bad people, they should also be supervised by the broad masses, and even judged by the people's laws, and it is not allowed to beat or scold them under any circumstances. No one should believe that beating and scolding will solve any problems.

    Some cadres working in new areas say: "The situation in the new area is special, and it is inevitable to make the mistake of coercion and command." This is also completely unfounded. Commandism is absolutely wrong, therefore, no matter what special circumstances there are, it is not allowed to implement commandism. The situation in the vast new liberated areas of our country today is different from that in the old liberated areas, but this is due to the complex conditions of objective history, which are situations that can be recognized and mastered. The people in the new areas have suffered from the oppression and destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries for a long time. On the one hand, they are eager to obtain today's liberation; on the other hand, some of them have also been influenced by the past rule of the Kuomintang and do not yet understand the policies of the People's Government and the Communist Party of China, which requires us to carry out extensive education and explanation work for them, and to enable them to understand and accept various policies that represent their interests through their own personal experience. In fact, after the broad masses of the people in the new areas were liberated from the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, their enthusiasm for supporting the People's Liberation Army, supporting the People's Government, and supporting the Communist Party of China is very high. As long as we correctly enlighten, educate, and lead them, and are good at following the mass line, there are no insurmountable difficulties. Special problems in any special circumstances can be solved. If our cadres and staff members are infected with the Kuomintang work style and adopt commandism to treat the people in the new areas, violating our original intention of serving the people, it will precisely hinder their consciousness and create the opposite result.

    "Because the higher-ups committed bureaucratism, the lower-ups committed commandism." This is also not a valid reason. Do some higher-level leading organs and leading cadres have a bureaucratic work style? It is undeniable that some do. Therefore, the higher-ups must constantly review, and always be vigilant and overcome the tendency of bureaucratism. A large part of the reason why some higher-level leading organs and leading cadres have a bureaucratic work style is due to insufficient understanding of the actual situation. In this regard, the lower levels have the responsibility to provide actual materials at any time, to promptly reflect actual problems, to collect the opinions of the masses, and to help the higher levels achieve correct leadership. Therefore, the lower levels have no reason to unilaterally use the bureaucratism of the higher levels as an excuse to cover up their own commandism. In fact, commandism and bureaucratism are both manifestations of being divorced from reality and being divorced from the masses, and their essence is the same. And some lower-level cadres' commandist misconduct completely violates the intentions of any higher-up, for which no higher-up can be responsible for them.

    When all the reasons for defending commandism are untenable, some comrades put on airs and say: "I am a worker-peasant cadre, a roughneck, and I don't know that set of rules." We should advise these comrades: This attitude is by no means sufficient to represent the broad masses of worker-peasant cadres, but only insults them. In fact, the vast majority of worker-peasant cadres are not commandists, or at least not commandists who know their mistakes but do not correct them. Worker-peasant cadres should not be complacent, nor should they be discouraged. They can completely learn the art of leading the masses, and often learn faster and more successfully than intellectual cadres. Our worker-peasant cadres originally came from the masses, and are excellent and advanced elements in the masses. Therefore, worker-peasant cadres are generally good at contacting the masses, going deep into the masses, and understanding the demands of the masses; therefore, worker-peasant cadres should never implement coercion and command on the masses. Many of our worker-peasant cadres have also been under the education of the Party for a long time, and are familiar with basic policies and the backbone of implementing policies, therefore, they should be good at grasping the spirit of the policies. Our worker-peasant cadres have these two superior conditions of being good at contacting the masses and grasping the spirit of the policies, then, as long as they are not arrogant and complacent, humbly learn new things, and at any time and place, according to the specific situation and the specific demands of the masses, implement the instructions of the higher-ups and grasp the spirit of the policies, they will definitely be able to correctly lead the masses to do their work well. The error of commandism is completely avoidable.

    Opposing and overcoming commandism is absolute and there can be no exceptions. This is because commandism is wrong under any circumstances. Of course, when specifically examining the error of commandism, we should adopt the policy of curing the disease and saving the person, analyze the various different situations of the cadres who have made mistakes, find out the various reasons why they have made mistakes, point out the ways to correct them, and enable everyone's ideological and political level to be raised to a certain extent. At the same time, opposing and overcoming commandism must never advocate tailism that allows the masses to drift along on their own. We must correctly lead the masses. And the key to realizing leadership over the masses lies in following the mass line. We must be good at educating and explaining to the masses patiently, according to the specific situation of each region, and according to the policies and laws that represent the interests of the vast majority of the people, and obtain the consent and support of the masses, in order to complete various work tasks.

### 坚决反对命令主义

　　坚决反对命令主义
    各地的整风运动，证明了我们干部作风上比较普遍的毛病是命令主义。有许多同志已经决心纠正这种毛病，这是好的。可是也有些同志还没有充分了解命令主义的害处；或者犯了命令主义的毛病，不肯改正，还捏造了许多理由来辩护。这种现象必须加以克服。
    我们每一个共产党员和干部，都要经常记住我们共产党的党章和毛泽东同志关于党的作风的基本指示。党章的总纲规定：“中国共产党必须经常警戒自己脱离人民群众的危险性，必须经常注意防止和清洗自己内部的尾巴主义、命令主义、关门主义、官僚主义与军阀主义等脱离群众的错误倾向。”党章规定党员的义务，是要“为人民群众服务，巩固党与人民群众的联系，了解并及时反映人民群众的需要，向人民群众解释党的政策。”毛泽东同志在党的第七次全国代表大会上的报告，着重地告诉我们：“在一切工作中，命令主义是错误的。因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。”我们每个党员和干部，都应该按照党章的标准和毛泽东同志的指示，来检查自己的工作，提高自己的觉悟。
    这许多年来，我们的大多数党员和干部，在党中央和毛泽东同志的正确领导下，全心全意为人民服务，艰苦奋斗，取得了中国人民民主革命的伟大胜利。这是有功于人民的，是不能否认的。可是我们也不能否认，有些同志并没有完全按照党章和毛泽东同志的指示来办事，往往仍然有意无意地犯了命令主义的错误。今天，当着革命已经在全国取得基本胜利的时候，我们的党有了更大的发展。这时候，老党员、老干部中有的不免骄傲居功，看不起群众，助长了命令主义的错误倾向；新党员、新干部中有的受了国民党作风的影响，也有的不懂得怎样走群众路线，他们都很容易采取命令主义的恶劣作风来对待群众，把许多正确的政策和代表群众利益的好事办坏了。这种命令主义作风，如果让它发展下去，对人民群众和革命事业会有极大的危害。一切忠实于人民、忠实于革命的同志，都应该自觉地起来，坚决反对与克服这种命令主义作风。对于命令主义作风的一切辩护，都是完全错误的。
    有人说：“我命令群众，就是执行人民政府的法令。”但是人民政府的法令和命令主义者对待群众的命令主义是毫不相干和根本不同的。命令主义者对群众的强迫命令不是真正执行人民政府的法令，而是违背人民政府的法令。人民政府的法令是代表与保护最大多数人民的利益的。它对于少数人违反最大多数人民利益的违法行为，可以而且应该实行强制的方法。但是命令主义却是另一种性质的东西。命令主义者不根据实际情况和群众的觉悟程度，不向群众进行动员和解释的工作，采取简单的粗暴的方式，强迫群众接受他们所不能接受的事情。这一类事情有的是根本违反群众利益，因此是群众根本不能接受的；有的虽然在某种程度上代表着一部分群众的利益，但是为另一部分群众所不能接受的；有的即便是完全代表群众的利益，但是由于一般群众觉悟程度的限制暂时还不能被接受的。总之，无论在什么样的情况下所产生的命令主义，都是错误的。即便是为了执行人民政府的法令，任何人也没有理由对群众实行强迫。因为只有对于违法分子的违法行为，才能由执法机关依法制裁。人民政府的法令，是集中了群众的意见，从群众中来的。但是群众的意见，往往是分散的零碎的。这些意见被集中起来成了法令的时候，和最初分散的零碎的群众意见就不一样了。当着我们执行这些法令的时候，当着这些法令回到群众中去的时候，一定要向群众进行解释工作，决不应该用简单的粗暴的方式，强制群众来执行。列宁在俄国共产党第八次代表大会上关于农村工作的报告中说过：“法令基本上都是正确的。我们没有根据来拒绝或惋惜其中任何一个法令。但法令虽是正确，若用强力去强迫农民来接受，便是不正确的了。在任何一个法令中都没有这样说过。”这难道还不明白吗？
    有的人说：“任务紧急繁重，不能按政策办事，只能强迫命令。”这种说法也是错误的。政策和任务决不是对立的。我们的各项政策都是根据最大多数人民的最高利益来制定的；我们的任务，就是要保证实现最大多数人民的最高利益。只有正确地执行了政策，才是完成了任务；违背了政策就不可能完成任务。执行政策和完成任务是每一个全心全意为人民服务的革命干部的神圣职责。要正确执行每一项政策，要完成每一项工作任务，各级领导机关和干部党员都要进行艰苦的教育群众、说服群众的工作，都要按照群众路线来办事。即便有时任务紧急，但是只要各级领导机关和干部党员平时向群众进行了基本政策的教育与解释工作，在群众觉悟和自愿的基础上，群众也是能够随时接受我们的号召，共同完成紧急任务的。过去在执行所谓“紧急繁重”的任务中发生的某些缺点和错误，有一部分是由于若干领导机关制定政策不慎重、布置工作不周密和对下级具体帮助不够；但也有很大部分是由于执行任务的工作干部不顾政策，不走群众路线的结果。有的干部把打人骂人也说成是为了完成任务，这难道是可以相信的吗？还有个别干部甚至于夸耀他自己如何用强迫命令“完成了任务”，这难道不应该深刻检讨吗？犯了这样错误的干部，应该无条件地向群众道歉认错，并决心改正错误。
    “向群众要东西非强迫不可，只有拿东西给群众才不必强迫。”这又是一种极端错误的说法。这是一部分工作人员沾染了国民党思想和国民党作风的反映。存在这种思想作风的人，根本不了解我们为中国人民革命与建设事业所进行的一切努力，都是为了人民群众的利益。人民群众出人、出力、出钱来支持革命与建设事业，他们懂得这就是为了他们自己的利益。也只有当着人民群众懂得了这个真理之后，他们才会自觉地“拿出东西”，甚至于在必要的时候贡献他们的生命。这在我国过去长期革命战争中，广大人民群众的无数可歌可泣的事迹，都已经向我们做了最有力的证明。我们从来是把群众利益放在第一位的，从群众的长远的利益到他们日常的生活利益都包括在内。我们从来没有放松过对群众日常生活利益的照顾，并积极帮助群众克服困难。毛泽东同志在“组织起来”的讲话中，早就指出：“如果我们做地方工作的同志脱离了群众，不了解群众的情绪，不能够帮助群众组织生产，改善生活，只知道向他们要救国公粮，而不知道首先用百分之九十的精力去帮助群众解决他们‘救民私粮’的问题，然后仅仅用百分之十的精力就可以解决救国公粮的问题，那末，这就是沾染了国民党作风，沾染了官僚主义的灰尘。”由此可见，把所谓“向群众要东西”和“拿东西给群众”这两方面对立起来，借以辩护对群众的命令主义的错误，是完全没有道理的。
    还有人说：“群众太落后，不强迫命令不行。”这是把个别群众的某些落后现象夸大起来，作为掩饰自己错误的借口。我们既然是为人民群众服务的，我们首要的责任就是向群众进行耐心的教育，提高群众的政治觉悟。只要群众的政治觉悟普遍提高了，个别的落后现象是可以克服的；即便暂时不可能完全克服，但仍然要继续耐心地教育与说服他们，不应该放弃教育说服工作，而采取粗暴的命令主义方式。比如，打人骂人即便使人害怕，决不会使人心服，这是极明显的事实。因为打骂决不是教育。有些人说“我不打好人，打坏人。”这更是自欺欺人的遁辞。假若有个别确实是坏人，也应该由广大的群众对他们实行监督，以至于由人民的法律对他们实行裁判，而不允许在任何情况下对他们实行打骂。谁也不应该相信打骂会解决任何问题的。
    有些在新区工作的干部说：“新区情况特殊，难免不犯强迫命令的错误。”这同样是毫无根据的。命令主义是绝对错误的，因此，无论有什么特殊情况，都不能允许实行命令主义。目前我国广大新解放区的情况，和老解放区比较起来，虽然有所不同，但这是由于客观历史的复杂条件所造成的，是可以被认识和被掌握的情况。新区的人民，过去长期遭受国民党反动派的压迫与摧残，他们一方面渴望得到今天的解放；另一方面他们也有一些是受了过去国民党统治的影响，还不了解人民政府和中国共产党的政策，这就需要我们对他们进行广泛的教育解释工作，并且使他们通过自己亲身的体验来了解与接受代表他们利益的各种政策。事实上新区广大人民从国民党反动派统治下解放出来之后，他们拥护人民解放军、拥护人民政府和中国共产党的热情很高，只要我们正确地加以启发、教育与领导，善于走群众路线，决没有不可克服的困难。任何特殊情况下的特殊问题都是可以解决的。如果我们的干部和工作人员，沾染了国民党作风，采取命令主义来对待新区的人民群众，违背了我们为人民服务的本意，那就恰恰会阻碍他们的觉悟，并且造成相反的结果。
    “因为上级犯了官僚主义，下级才犯命令主义。”这也是不成理由的。某些上级领导机关和领导干部有没有官僚主义作风呢？不可否认是有的。因此，上级才要不断检讨，经常警惕与克服官僚主义的倾向。某些上级领导机关和领导干部官僚主义作风产生的原因，有很大部分是由于对实际情况了解不够。在这一方面，下级有责任随时提供实际材料，及时地反映实际问题，搜集群众的意见，帮助上级实现正确的领导。因此下级没有理由片面地借口上级的官僚主义，来掩盖自己的命令主义。实际上，命令主义和官僚主义都是脱离实际脱离群众的表现，它们的本质是相同的。而有些下级干部命令主义的胡作非为，根本违背了任何上级的意图，这是任何上级所不能够替他们负责的。
    当着一切辩护命令主义的理由都不能成立的时候，有的同志，就摆起架子说：“我是工农干部，老粗，不会那一套。”我们应该忠告这些同志：这种态度，决不足以代表广大的工农干部，而只是污辱了他们。事实上绝大多数工农干部并不是命令主义者，或者至少不是知过不改的命令主义者。工农干部不应当自满，也不应当自馁，他们完全可以学会领导群众的艺术，而且常常比知识分子干部学习得更快，更成功。我们的工农干部本来就是从群众中来的，是群众中优秀的先进的分子。因此，工农干部一般地善于联系群众，深入群众，了解群众的要求；因此，工农干部决不应该对群众实行强迫命令。我们的工农干部有许多又是长期在党的教育之下，熟悉基本政策和执行政策的骨干，因此，就应该善于掌握政策的精神。我们的工农干部有了善于联系群众和掌握政策精神这两方面的优越条件，那末，只要不骄傲自满，虚心学习新鲜事物，随时随地根据具体情况和群众的具体要求，执行上级的指示，掌握政策的精神，就一定能够正确地领导群众把工作做好。命令主义的错误是完全可以避免的。
    反对与克服命令主义是绝对的，不能有任何例外。这是因为无论在任何情况下，命令主义都是错误的。当然，在具体检查命令主义错误的时候，应该采取治病救人的方针，分析犯错误干部的各种不同的情况，找出他们犯错误的各种原因，指出改正的办法，使大家的思想水平和政治水平获得一定的提高。同时，反对与克服命令主义决不能提倡放任群众自流的尾巴主义。我们一定要正确地去领导群众。而实现对群众领导的关键，就在于走群众路线。要善于根据各地的具体情况，按照着代表最大多数人民利益的政策和法令，向群众进行耐心的教育与解释，取得群众的同意与拥护，来完成各项工作任务。
