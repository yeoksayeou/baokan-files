　　The People's Insurance Undertaking of New China
            I. Characteristics of the People's Insurance Undertaking

　　The People's Insurance Undertaking of New China is managed under the leadership of the People's Insurance Company of China. The People's Insurance Company of China is the only nationwide state-owned insurance institution directly under the leadership of the People's Bank of China. Its business operations are not only different from those of insurance companies in imperialist countries, but also fundamentally different from the colonial insurance industry controlled by the four major families before liberation, which relied on the breath of imperialism. Its characteristics are specifically manifested in:

　　(1) Independent and Autonomous Style: The old Chinese insurance industry not only had few companies and weak capital, but also relied on establishing reinsurance relationships with foreign insurance companies to maintain itself. Whenever a large insurance policy was needed, it had to be "greatly" ceded out, actually acting as a broker for imperialist insurance companies in China and a tool to help imperialism exploit the Chinese people. After the establishment of the People's Insurance Company of China after liberation, this situation was fundamentally changed. The funds of the People's Insurance Company of China are supplied and supported by the People's Bank of China, and its strength is abundant. Therefore, it does not need to rely on establishing reinsurance relationships with foreign insurance companies, but serves the people with the spirit of independence and autonomy.

　　(2) Clear Purpose of Supporting Production and Serving the People: From the day it opened, the People's Insurance Company determined that "it is to accumulate vast dispersed funds to protect state property, ensure production safety, and improve the welfare of the working people." Therefore, its tasks are threefold: (1) to support production, (2) to protect the property of the people's motherland, and (3) to promote the welfare of the working people. To accomplish these three major tasks, the People's Insurance Company has now launched eighteen types of businesses. In terms of property insurance, there are: ordinary fire insurance, employee group fire insurance; in terms of personal insurance, there are: group personal insurance, crew group insurance, crew and passenger accident insurance. For farmers, there are specialized plough cattle (livestock) insurance and cotton harvest insurance to meet the needs of agricultural production. For trade, there are various transportation insurances specifically designed to meet the needs of transportation (including trains, ships, wooden boats, carts, postal parcels, gold and silver, etc.). In addition, there are also auto insurance, ship insurance, fishing boat insurance, cocoon insurance, glass insurance, etc. Those under preparation include: life insurance, railway insurance, aircraft insurance, fishery insurance, public grain insurance and other new businesses to meet general needs.

　　(3) Sincere Spirit of Uniting Private Insurance Industry: In the past, the private insurance industry, because of its own weakness and the monopoly and infighting of bureaucratic capital, mostly felt the difficulty of reinsurance, and therefore could not expand its business. In order to unite and support them, the People's Insurance Company, in addition to educating them to serve the people and serve production, has established a close "reinsurance" relationship in business and allowed them to handle reinsurance, so that they can let go of their worries and take on business. As a result, the private insurance business has gained new development. Although the number of companies has decreased slightly, the business after refinement has greatly developed. For example, the Shanghai Minlian Reinsurance Exchange Office has twenty-eight private insurance companies participating. Before the reorganization (before March this year), the average monthly premium income was 4,872,000 yuan. After the reorganization, the average monthly premium income reached 8,767,100 yuan, an increase of nearly one time.

　　(4) New Style of Careful Investigation and Rapid Settlement of Claims: The speed of compensation work in the insurance industry has a decisive impact on the company's credibility. In the past, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, most insurance companies were corrupt. When accidents occurred, they often made excuses for investigation, pushing responsibility around, causing the insured to suffer great losses. In response to this, the People's Insurance Company, after careful investigation of events, immediately settled claims, and was therefore extremely popular. For example, in the Southwest region this year, the settlement time has been shortened by two-thirds compared to the past six months. The Jin Hua Pharmacy in Zhengzhou, Henan, lost more than 23 million yuan and insured for 3 million yuan. According to the stipulated sharing method, the compensation was 2.2 million yuan, and the payment was made in less than ten days from the fire report. When a fire occurred at the Wen Yide household in Fushun, Northeast China, comrades from the People's Insurance Company guarded the scene overnight, investigated the situation clearly within two hours, and paid 5.2 million yuan in compensation, making the insured extremely satisfied. The four neighbors and the shoe industry on the fire site insured more than ten items that day. In addition, there were also those who voluntarily published acknowledgements in the newspaper to promote it.

            II. Several Experiences

　　(1) Taking into Account Urban and Rural Industrial and Agricultural Production. According to the rise of the insurance business in China, there are two factors: one is the penetration of foreign companies with the economic aggression of imperialism; the other is the imitation of the Chinese comprador bourgeoisie. However, neither of them thought about supporting production. Therefore, although the insurance industry has been established for a short time, it can only circle in larger cities, and the vast rural areas cannot go down. The People's Insurance Company accepted the Soviet experience, so that the insurance business is no longer limited to cities, but goes to the vast rural areas to serve agricultural production. For example, in the suburbs of Beijing, Jiaodong Shanghe, and Beibei, Sichuan, plough cattle (livestock) insurance has been piloted successively, and more than 7,500 heads have been insured. According to statistics from nine villages in Dali Township, Shanghe County, Jiaodong, 130 heads of plough cattle were insured in just eight days, accounting for 94 percent of the total number of plough cattle. As a result of actual work, farmers gradually changed from misunderstanding to understanding, and realized the benefits of insurance, thinking that it is a good thing that "thousands of households help one family." They said: "Farmers rely on cattle to eat, and they can rest assured that they are insured." Some said: "My cattle are insured and will become immortal cattle." "Today, the people's insurance company of the people's government is planning for the people everywhere." This new direction of taking into account industrial and agricultural production in urban and rural areas has washed away the comprador nature of the insurance industry in the past, injected fresh blood, and become a noble cause.

　　(2) Expanding Business and Lowering Premiums, Expanding Business by Lowering Premiums. If the insurance industry wants to expand, it must have two conditions: 1. The national economy develops and people's purchasing power increases; 2. The premium is appropriately reduced. The former depends on the development of the entire economic construction work, which is not something that the insurance company itself can do, and the latter can be done to a certain extent as long as it can expand its business. At present, our premium standard is generally 3 per thousand, which is the same as in the Soviet Union, which is about 40% lower than the foreign insurance premium in their own country. Of course, it is not too high, but because the purchasing power of our people is not as good as that of the Soviet Union, it may still need to be relatively reduced. Today, in terms of premium rates, the People's Insurance Company has reduced ship insurance and auto insurance by two-thirds compared with before liberation. The fire insurance in North China has been reduced from 8 per thousand at the beginning of the business to 5.5 per thousand. The first National Insurance Conference recently is also discussing further reduction.

　　(3) Close Combination of Insurance and Risk Prevention Work. The insurance business has low fees and heavy responsibilities, so only by closely combining with risk prevention work and changing passive insurance into active insurance can the responsibilities entrusted by the state be achieved. The People's Insurance Company has made this clear from the date of its establishment, changed the old view that the insurance industry is purely for profit, and established close ties with fire protection, epidemic prevention and other departments to engage in risk prevention work. For example, Beijing has conducted 278 fire prevention inspections (166 households) in half a year, from understanding the situation to providing opinions and urging improvements. As a result, there were 142 fire alarms in the city in half a year, and none of them occurred in the inspected households. As a result, many people welcomed this kind of inspection. For example, grain and department stores requested "it is best to go once a month." However, there are also a few places that ignore this work, just as some reflect: "Before the insurance, I visited again and again, and after collecting the premium, I never saw each other again." This should arouse high vigilance and quickly pay attention to correcting it.

　　(4) Close Combination of Insurance and Banking Business. There are many examples of the close combination of people's insurance work and the work of the People's Bank of China, which has been carried out seriously and has made achievements. For example, the Anshan Bank agency in the Northeast, which absorbs deposits through launching insurance, has not only not damaged the deposit absorption work, but also increased the number of depositors. In addition, many branches help each other in investigation and understanding through insurance work when lending, avoiding many unnecessary losses. Therefore, we say that this combination is not only necessary, but also beneficial.

　　(5) Two Attitudes, Two Practices and Two Results in the Fieldwork Style: One is to start from the task or subjective willingness, and the requirements are very urgent. These people come to the public enterprise department and regard the instructions of the Finance and Economics Committee of the State Council as "holy decree," thinking that it is the only magic weapon to promote business. Some even cut the original text and carry it with them, but they did not understand its spirit, thinking that a piece of paper can solve all problems; when soliciting insurance from private enterprises, they imitate the vulgar style of merchants, simply and mechanically "opening their mouths to the benefits of insurance and closing their mouths to the harm of not insuring." Although he also achieved "diligent legs" and "diligent mouth," because he had no mass viewpoint, lacked a spirit of service, could not combine with risk prevention work, and his level of business knowledge was not high enough, what he said was always the same old thing, so he made people feel bored and even refused to see him. In this way, it is of course difficult for people to realize the benefits of insurance. The second is to start from serving the other party in a down-to-earth manner, and regard the matter of caring about the interests of others as their own responsibility. They can carefully observe, analyze and study, discover the degree of possible harm from the specific situation of others, or raise questions and sincerely advise from the specific materials of general accidents, but whether to insure or not is up to them. The result of doing so is bound to be able to establish a solid foundation among the masses, and the business will naturally increase, and because the other party accepts the opinions and improves equipment, avoiding or reducing the occurrence of accidents, not only does the insured effectively obtain direct benefits, but also completes the purpose of protecting the property of the people of the motherland and supporting production entrusted by the state. Since the establishment of the People's Insurance Company, most of the field staff have indeed adopted the second approach, so that the emerging people's insurance business is thriving, but another part of the comrades who are unwilling to take off the baggage of bureaucracy and commandism are still using the bad practices of the old society to hinder the development of the people's insurance business, which urgently needs to be vigorously cleared.

　　(6) Strengthening Propaganda Work: The insurance business has close relations with various departments and various undertakings, because through it, the accidental losses can be compensated through the organizational role of mutual assistance and mutual benefit. However, to this day, insurance work is still unfamiliar to many people and needs to be publicized and explained widely. It should be known that accidental accidents cannot be absolutely avoided. According to statistics from four major cities, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou, a total of 108.2 fires occurred every month last year (Tianjin all year, Shanghai and Hankou June to December, Guangzhou November and December). This year (Tianjin January to May, Shanghai January and February, Hankou January to April, Guangzhou February) increased to 132.1 times, with an average of 34.03 times per place, that is to say, in these four cities, there is an average of one fire occurring every day in each place. The general losses are: (1) One fire in one house causes disasters to the neighbors. According to statistics from Shanghai from June last year to February this year, among the houses completely or partially destroyed after the fire, the households that started the fire lost 164 rooms, and the households that were burned down lost 278 rooms, which is close to a ratio of 1 to 2. (2) The disaster area is extremely wide. According to statistics from Wuhan from June to December last year, a total of 366 households and 1,036 people were affected, accounting for 1 per thousand of the city's total population of 1 million. (3) Casualties, unnecessary losses, the total number of casualties in the four cities is 147, with an average of 8.3 days per place, with one casualty every two days. (4) Property losses: According to the cumulative statistics of twenty-four months in the four cities, the total property losses are worth nearly 3 billion yuan, with an average of more than 120 million yuan per month. A bathhouse in Tianjin lost more than 60 million yuan at one time. In May this year, 70 houses were destroyed, of which 60 were buildings. This is an alarming statistic.

　　It can be seen that only by participating in insurance through insurance companies and establishing a wide range of mutual assistance and mutual benefit relationships with the society can the losses be compensated.

            III. Existing Problems in Insurance Work

　　(1) Weak Foreign Currency Insurance Strength: Since the invasion of China by the insurance business of imperialism, the vast majority of China's insurance business has been controlled by it, plundering the economic interests of the Chinese people and stifling Chinese insurers. The premiums of such foreign insurance companies are generally higher than those of Chinese insurance companies, and Chinese people have to pay more than five times the premium when insuring. It is estimated that before the war, foreign companies seized profits of 2.35 million pounds per year, accounting for about 75 percent of China's total premiums. During the Kuomintang rule, due to the then traitorous policy, foreign companies were even more arrogant, neither registering with the government nor joining the industry association. After liberation, the people's government reversed the rights and interests with its independent and autonomous policy, and its ferocity gradually diminished. For example, the number of foreign insurance companies in Tianjin has been reduced from 19 to 5, and the general fire insurance business in various places has been stopped, but in business competition, the emerging People's Insurance Company still feels insufficient in foreign currency insurance. According to statistics, in the first half of this year, the foreign currency transportation water insurance underwritten by the Tianjin People's Insurance Branch accounted for only 23 percent of the total amount combined with foreign companies. This is a problem that requires our practical efforts.

　　(2) Agencies Urgently Need to Be Familiar with the Business: At present, although as many as 64 agencies have been established in various places, and close ties have been established with the masses, most of the people in these institutions do not understand the insurance business and urgently need to organize education and learning. For example, the Henan Branch Company reported that most people "are too unfamiliar with insurance and dare not do it boldly. Some agencies in some parts are afraid of trouble and think that they have collected very little premium from others and have to bear great responsibilities. In case of an accident, the customer wants him to pay, and he will not pay himself, which is easy to cause trouble." In fact, this situation may not be limited to the Henan Branch Company, and there must be many similar places. Therefore, strengthening and doing a good job in education work, assigning special personnel to be responsible, strengthening professional research, and exchanging work methods and experience more, so as to expand and improve the insurance business, is an important topic at present.

　　(3) A Considerable Number of Public Enterprises Are Unwilling to Insure. Since the Central Financial and Economic Committee issued instructions last December, urging public enterprises to insure, coupled with the subjective efforts of comrades from People's Insurance Companies in various places to solicit business, many public enterprises have indeed understood the importance and role of the insurance business and have insured. For example, public enterprises have accounted for 87 percent of the insured amount in East China; in the competition campaign in the Northeast as of mid-February this year, the insured amount in Yanji, Fushun, Yingkou and other places exceeded the task by more than ten times, mainly due to the participation of public enterprises. There are 48 public enterprises insuring in Beijing, accounting for more than half. However, there are still some public enterprises hesitating today. Some people even have resistance in their minds, thinking that it is "painting the snake and adding feet" and "there is no way to pay the reimbursement," and they have no vigilance against the possibility of disasters. This should continue to be explained in many ways and clarified ideologically.

　　新中国的人民保险事业
            一、人民保险事业经营的特征
    新中国的人民保险事业，是由中国人民保险公司领导经营的。中国人民保险公司是在中国人民银行直接领导下，唯一具有全国性的国营保险机构，其事业经营不仅与帝国主义国家的保险公司不同，即与解放前在四大家族的控制下，依赖帝国主义鼻息的殖民地性的保险业，亦有本质上的区别。它的特点具体表现在：
    （一）独立自主的风格：旧中国的保险业不仅家数很少，且资力薄弱，多靠与外商保险公司建立分保关系而维持，每遇大宗投保，只得“大额”分出，实际上是帝国主义在华保险公司的经纪人，是帮助帝国主义剥削中国人民的工具。解放后中国人民保险公司一建立，便基本上改变了这种状态。中国人民保险公司的资金由中国人民银行供给和支持，实力雄厚，因此它不需要依靠与外商保险公司建立分保关系，而本独立自主的精神，为人民服务。
    （二）扶植生产事业服务人民的明确目的：人民保险公司自开业那天起，就确定了“他是从积聚广大分散资金来保护国家财产，保障生产安全，与提高劳动人民的福利事业”的。因此它的任务有三：（１）扶植生产事业，（２）保护人民祖国的财产，（３）增进劳动人民的福利。为完成这三大任务，人民保险公司到现在已举办了十八种业务，如在财产保险方面有：普通火险，职工团体火险；在人身保险方面有：团体人身保险，船员团体保险，船员乘客意外伤害险。对农民来说，有专为适应农业生产需要的耕牛（牲畜）保险和棉花收获保险。对贸易上来说，有专为适应往来运输需要的各种运输保险（包括火车、轮船、木船、大车、邮包、金钞等）。此外尚有汽车险、船舶险、渔船险、茧钞险、玻璃险等项。正在筹办中者则有：人寿险、铁路险、飞机险、渔业险、公粮险和其他各种适应普遍需要的新业务。
    （三）团结私营保险业的真挚精神：过去私营保险业因为本身实力虚弱，在官僚资本垄断把持与相互倾轧之下，大多感觉再保险的困难，因而无法扩充业务；人民保险公司为团结扶植起见，除教育其服务于人民、服务于生产之外，在业务上更建立密切的“分保”关系，并准予办理再保险，使其无顾虑的放手揽做业务。私营保险事业因此便获得了新的发展，虽然现在按家数说略有减少，但经过洗炼后的业务却大大发展了。例如上海民联分保交换处参加的私营保险公司有二十八家，改组前（今年三月前）每月平均收保费四八、七二○万元，改组后每月平均收入保费达到八七、六七一万元，增加将近一倍。
    （四）慎重调查、迅速理赔的新作风：保险业赔偿工作进行的快慢，对公司的信用有决定性的影响。以往的保险公司，在国民党反动统制之下，大多腐败不堪，发生事故，往往借口调查，东推西托，使投保人备受损害。人民保险公司针对此点，遇事经过慎重调查后，即迅速理赔，因而极受人们欢迎。如西南区今年理赔时间，半年来较前提早三分之二。河南郑州晋华药房损失二千三百余万，投保三百万，照章分摊办法，赔款二百二十万，从火灾报告到赔付不满十天。东北抚顺文义德户出了火险，人民保险公司同志代为看守一夜，并于二小时以内调查清楚，赔付五百二十万元，使保户异常满意，火场四邻及鞋业行当日投保十余件，此外尚有自动登报鸣谢代为宣传的。
            二、几点经验
    （一）兼顾城乡中工农生产。按保险业务在中国的兴起，有两个因素：一是随着帝国主义的经济侵略，外商公司渗入；一是中国买办资产阶级的模仿，但同样都没有想到扶植生产这一回事，因此保险业的创立虽为时不短，却只能在较大城市中兜圈子，广大农村是下不去的。人民保险公司接受了苏联经验，使保险事业不再局限在城市，而走向广大的农村，为农业生产服务。例如：在北京市郊、胶东商河、四川北碚等地，先后均试办耕牛（牲畜）保险，已承保七、五○○余头。据胶东商河县大李乡九个村统计，短短八天中即投保耕牛一百三十头，占耕牛总数的百分之九十四。由于实际工作的结果，农民们逐渐由误解到了解，认识了保险的好处，认为是“千家万户帮一家”的好事情。他们说：“庄户人家是靠牛吃饭的，保上了险就放心了。”有的说：“我的牛保了险，就成了长生不死的牛了。”“今天人民政府的保险公司，处处是为人民打算的。”这种对城乡中工农业生产兼顾的新方向，使保险业洗去了过去买办性的污垢，注入了新鲜血液，而成为高尚的事业。
    （二）扩充业务、降低保费，从降低保费来扩充业务。保险业要想扩充，必须有两个条件，一、国民经济发展，人民购买力提高；二、保费适当降低。前者有赖于整个经济建设工作的发展，不是保险公司本身所可办到的，后者只要能扩大业务，则可做到一部分。目前我们的保费标准一般为千分之三，与苏联一样，较外商对其本国保费一般还要低六折左右，当然已不算太高，但因我国人民的购买力还不及苏联，恐仍须相对的降低。今天人民保险公司在费率方面，轮船险、汽车险较解放前，减低三分之二。华北区火险由开业时的千分之八，减为千分之五点五。最近第一届全国保险会议还正在讨论再行减低。
    （三）保险与防险工作密切结合。保险业务，收费低而责任重，故只有与防险工作密切结合，变消极的保险为积极的保险，才能达成国家所付予的责任。人民保险公司自成立之日起就明确了这一点，改变了保险业纯以营利为目的的旧观点，而与消防、防疫等部门建立了密切的联系，从事防险工作。如北京半年内进行防火检查二七八次（一六六户），由了解情况到提供意见督促改善，结果，全市半年火警一四二次，没有一次发生在检查户中。于是很多人对于此种检查表示欢迎，如粮食、百货公司即要求“最好每月去一次”。但也有少数地方忽视这一工作的，正如有些反映：“既保之前，三番五次访问，收保费之后，再不见面。”这是应该引起高度警惕，迅速注意纠正的。
    （四）保险与银行业务工作密切结合。人民的保险工作与人民银行工作密切结合，认真进行而且作出成绩的例子很多，如东北鞍山银行代理处，吸收存款通过发动保险，不但未使吸存工作受损，而且还增加了存户。又有许多行处贷款时通过保险工作，互相帮助调查了解的结果，避免了不少不应有的损失。因此我们说这种结合不仅是有必要的，而且也是有利的。
    （五）外勤业务作风中的两种态度两种作法和两种结果：一种是从任务或主观意愿出发，要求很急，这些人到了公营企业部门，以政务院财经委会指示为“圣旨”，认为是推动业务的唯一法宝，有的甚至将原文剪下带在身上，但并未体会它的精神，以为一纸命令便可以解决一切问题；向私营企业揽保时，更模仿商人庸俗作风，单纯而机械地“开口保险之利，闭口不保之害”。虽然他也作到了“腿勤”和“嘴勤”，但因为没有群众观点，缺乏服务精神，不能和防险工作结合，加上业务知识水平不够高，所谈的总是老一套，因此便使人感到腻烦，甚至拒而不见。这样当然难以让人体会到保险的好处。第二种是踏踏实实从服务对方出发，把关心别人利益的事，当成自己的责任，能细致观察，分析研究，由别人具体情况中发现可能危害的程度，或由一般出险事故的具体材料中，提出问题，诚恳忠告，但投保与否，则听其自愿，这样作的结果，必然是能在群众中建立巩固的基础，业务也自然能增加，且因对方接受意见，改善设备，避免或减少了出险事故的关系，不仅使投保户有效的获得直接得益，也完成了国家付托的保护祖国人民财产和扶持生产的目的。人民保险公司成立以来，的确大多数外勤人员是采取了第二种作法，因而使得新兴的人民保险事业蒸蒸日上，但是另一部分不肯解下官僚主义命令主义包袱的同志，直到今天还在沿用旧社会的恶劣作法，阻碍人民保险事业的发展，是亟须大力廓清的。
    （六）加强宣传工作：保险事业和各个部门、各种事业均有密切关系，因为通过它可以借互助互济的组织作用，把遭意外损失弥补起来。但是到今天为止保险工作对许多人还是生疏的，需要多加宣传，广泛说明。要知道意外的事故，是无法绝对避免的，根据上海、天津、汉口、广州四个主要城市统计，去年（天津全年上海汉口六至十二月，广州十一、十二月）每月合计发生火灾一○八·二次。今年（天津一至五月，上海一、二月，汉口一至四月，广州二月）增加到一三二·一次，每地平均为三四·○三次，就是说，此四城市中，每天每地平均要有一次火灾发生，一般损失是：（一）一家起火四邻遭殃，根据上海去年六月至今年二月统计，火起后全毁半毁房子中，起火户损失一六四间，延烧户损失二七八间，将近一与二之比，（二）被灾面积极广，根据武汉去年六至十二月统计，共被灾三六六户一○三六人，按该市共有人口一百万人计占千分之一。（三）伤亡人员，无谓损失，四个城市合计，共伤亡人数是一四七人，每地平均八·三天伤亡一人，四地合计，平均每两天伤亡一人。（四）财产损失：根据四个城市累积二十四个月度统计，共损失财产，价值近三十亿元，平均每月在一亿二千万元以上，天津一个澡塘，一次损失达六千万元以上，今年五月毁房七十间中，楼房占六十间，这是一个惊人的统计。
    由此可见只有通过保险公司参加保险，与社会上建立广泛的互助互济的关系，才能得到损失的弥补。
            三、保险工作上存在的问题
    （一）外币保险力量较弱：自帝国主义的保险事业入侵中国以来，中国绝大多数的保险业务便受其控制，掠夺中国人民的经济利益，也扼杀了中国的保险业者。此类外商保险公司保费一般较中国保险公司为高，国人投保时要多缴五倍以上的保费。据估计，战前外商公司每年攫去的利益数达二三五万英镑，约占中国全部保费的百分之七十五。国民党统治时期，由于当时卖国政策的结果，外商更为跋扈，不向政府办理登记也不加入同业公会。解放后，人民政府本独立自主的政策，挽回利权，其凶焰始渐减杀。例如天津外商保险公司已由十九家减为五家，各地一般的火险业务均已停止，但在业务竞争中，新兴的人民保险公司在外币保险上，力量仍觉不足，据统计今年上半年内天津人民保险分公司承揽的外币运输水险只占与外商合计总额的百分之二十三。这是需要我们切实努力的问题。
    （二）代理处迫切需要熟悉业务：目前各地代理处虽已建立六十四个之多，和群众建立了密切的联系，但这些机构中绝大多数人是不懂保险业务的，亟须组织教育学习。如河南分公司报告中曾提到多数人“对于保险太生疏，不敢大胆的搞，有些部分的代理处怕多事，认为收了人家很少的保费，要负担很大的责任，万一发生事故，客户要他赔，自己又不赔，容易引起麻烦”。实在说，此种情形恐不只河南分公司如此，类同地方一定是不少的，因此加强和作好教育工作，指定专人负责，加强专业研究，多交流工作办法与经验，从而把保险业务扩充起来提高一步，是目前一个重要的课题。
    （三）相当数量的公营企业不愿投保。自从中央财经委员会去年十二月发出指示，嘱公营企业必须保险以来，加上各地人民保险公司同志们主观努力揽收的结果，的确有不少公营企业，明了了保险事业的重要与作用，业已投保。例如华东承保保额中公营企业已占到百分之八十七；东北截至今年二月中为止的竞赛运动中，延吉、抚顺、营口等地承保额超过任务十倍以上，主要即为公营企业参加。北京公营企业投保者有四十八家，占半数以上。但是今天还有一部分公营企业，在徘徊犹豫。甚至有一部分人思想上还有抵抗，认为是“画蛇添足”“没法开支报销”，对于灾害发生的可能性毫无警惕，这是应该继续多方解释，从思想上弄通的。
