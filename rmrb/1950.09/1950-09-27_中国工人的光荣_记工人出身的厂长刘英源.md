　　The Glory of Chinese Workers
    ——Remembering Factory Director Liu Yingyuan, Who Came From the Ranks of Workers
    Lin Mo
    He came from the workers, deeply understands their lives, thoughts, and demands, and knows how to inspire their enthusiasm. He has been tempered by the collectivity of modern industry, acts quickly, is good at deciding issues, organizing forces, conducting thorough inspections, and maintains strict labor discipline.
    Liu Yingyuan is an outstanding factory director from the workers in the new China. His deeds demonstrate the glorious talent and wisdom of the Chinese working class in managing industry.
    Liu Yingyuan suffered oppression and torment in the old society. He began working as a packer at the British American Tobacco Company in Guandong at the age of eleven; later, he herded pigs, was constantly plagued by hunger, and did odd jobs everywhere, selling his labor; at fourteen, he went to work as an apprentice in a factory, staying with machines for more than thirty years.
    After the liberation of Harbin in 1946, Liu Yingyuan gradually realized from his own experiences that the People's Government and army led by the Chinese Communist Party truly worked for the benefit of the people. He felt that the working class, who had always been trampled underfoot by the reactionary ruling class, had turned over and become masters. He led the worker brothers of the Harbin Power Plant to overcome serious technical and equipment difficulties, working day and night, racking their brains, and giving full play to the creativity of the working class. They completed arduous and complex repair work, enabling the 800,000 people of Harbin to see the light and providing electricity to factories producing for the front lines. Liu Yingyuan was elected a labor hero three times – from then on, everyone called him "Hero Liu"!
    Hero Liu was later promoted to deputy director of the Harbin Power Plant and successively transferred to the Changchun Power Plant and the Fushun Power Plant as deputy director, leading the restoration work of the power plants there. In March 1950, he came to the Shijingshan Power Plant in the capital as director.
  Eliminating a Major Enemy
    In the past, when you arrived in Shijingshan, you would see the power plant's large chimney constantly billowing black smoke. This black smoke was truly overwhelming, with the factory buildings inside and out, and the nearby villages and fields often covered with a black layer, and the ground still greyish-black even when it snowed.
    Because of the black smoke emitted, the factory wasted five to six tons of coal every day; people inhaled the coal smoke daily, causing many employees to develop lung diseases; the coal smoke settled everywhere on the machines, also easily causing accidents and dangers.
    The reason for so much coal smoke was that the combustion system was unscientific. The fine coal powder produced by the coal pulverizer was not fully burned and was blown out of the chimney. Before liberation, everyone often complained that this thing was too harmful, and experienced veteran workers had also thought of solutions, and engineers had also researched it, but no one had a good solution. After liberation, improvements in production were taking place everywhere, and the leaders of the electricity bureau and the employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant proposed finding a way to solve the problem of coal smoke, and Soviet experts also came to the site to study and propose improvements. However, because no one was seriously leading the effort, the coal smoke continued to fly.
    After Hero Liu came to the Shijingshan Power Plant, he exchanged opinions with various parties and resolved to handle this matter. Based on his experience: if we can mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the employees in everything we do, and concentrate the wisdom of the masses, many unimaginable difficulties can be overcome.
    Hero Liu proposed to everyone: the problem of coal smoke is a major enemy of the Shijingshan Power Plant! He first conducted discussions through various meetings, calling on all employees of the plant to put forward more solutions; at the same time, he convened technical personnel and experienced workers to meet and study again and again, and specifically established a special research group, and announced that if the problem could be solved well, they would be rewarded with 20,000 catties of millet.
    In the process, Hero Liu first, based on the opinions of Soviet experts and workers Cao Jinsheng, Qi Yuliang, and technical personnel, blocked the ventilation openings of the operating parts of the coal pulverizer and converted them into a closed cycle, no longer blowing out coal powder due to the entry and exit of cold air, but this only solved half of the problem; further, he organized a coal pulverizer research group to study the secondary combustion of coal powder in the furnace. Workers Su Yuntang and Du Hongchang suggested changing the combustion pipe into the furnace, and after further supplementation and modification by everyone, they changed the straight pipe they designed into a crotch shape, correcting the problem that the amount of coal entering the furnace was too congested and the combustion was incomplete. The results of the refitting test were good, and the problem of coal smoke was finally solved. It is estimated that this improvement alone can save more than 2,000 tons of coal a year, greatly reducing the cost of power generation.
  Careful Inspection, Eliminate Accidents
    "Eliminate accidents, ensure the capital's safe power supply; rationalize production, reduce power generation costs." These were the two major tasks given to Hero Liu by the higher authorities when he came to the Shijingshan Power Plant. In order to eliminate accidents, he implemented a strict inspection system; clarified responsibilities in everything, and enforced strict rewards and punishments.
    In the past, major and minor accidents occurred constantly at the Shijingshan Power Plant. Every time an accident occurred, when it came to the issue of responsibility, they often pushed each other, complaining up and down, and in the end, it was always a mess.
    In response to this situation, Hero Liu first stipulated: accidents must be reported to the factory director within five minutes after they occur; a preliminary inspection result must be reported within half an hour; the cause of each accident must be thoroughly investigated, and responsibilities must be clearly assigned.
    In order to implement the new system, Hero Liu often personally presided over meetings to conduct reviews. Once, the worker Zhang Qingfu, who was watching the circulating water pump, was careless, and the vacuum dropped to zero degrees (indicating little water), affecting the operation of the machine, and he didn't even know it. During the post-incident review, he even tried to shirk responsibility, arguing: "The vacuum didn't drop to zero degrees there! It was still seventeen inches high!" But after Hero Liu's careful questioning and everyone's exposure, Zhang Qingfu had to honestly admit his mistake. Hero Liu asked him to write a review and submit it to the trade union, publicly criticized him in the wall newspaper, and gave him a job transfer as punishment. This matter immediately spread throughout the plant. Now, "the responsibility for each accident must be thoroughly investigated" is a method that has been consciously used by employees.
    Although Hero Liu usually loves his worker brothers so much, he is extremely strict with those who undermine labor discipline, are careless in their work, and are not responsible for state property. And the rewards and punishments for merits and demerits are also very clear.
    On June 5th, the stoker Zhao Xiquan did not carefully check the vacuum, and the water was already sufficient, but he still reported to foreman Song Wenying and asked to release water. After receiving the report, Song Wenying did not conduct an inspection and immediately ordered the worker watching the water pump to turn on the water pump, causing the boiler to overflow and flood the turbine.
    After the accident was investigated, Zhao Xiquan and Song Wenying were punished with salary reductions and demotions. However, the leaders of Unit 5, Li Fengming, and Unit 6, Cai Xuecheng, were specially rewarded by the factory for their careful and cautious handling after discovering the situation, which avoided a major power outage. The leadership's serious handling of affairs and clear rewards and punishments were praised by all employees.
    Through continuous post-incident inspections, everyone's sense of responsibility has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Hero Liu also frequently concentrates forces to implement regular plant-wide inspections. Conduct detailed inspections of machinery and equipment, operation, and operating conditions in a planned manner, visit each other, and eliminate various possible hidden accidents.
  Leadership is Not Sitting in the Office
    The reason why Hero Liu can often grasp the central issues in his work is that he can use the organization, implement collective leadership, and not commit事務主義 [This means being bogged down in routine tasks]. He fully empowers cadres at all levels, allowing them to carry out their work boldly and responsibly. He said: "A factory director must never take all the power into his own hands; it would be terrible if nothing could be done without the factory director every day!" He does not often sit in the office when he works. After going to work every day, he reads documents and newspapers, listens to reports within a certain period of time, and then goes to various sites to conduct on-the-spot inspections and understand the actual situation of the work.
    He always likes to be decisive and quick when he wants to do something. He often hates and criticizes those who delay things.
    He is very opposed to holding long meetings that do not solve problems. In the past, everyone often had meetings until late at night, making people exhausted. Hero Liu proposed to streamline meetings. Now the party, government, labor union, and youth league in the factory have signed a "meeting contract" and stipulate that if employees are called to a meeting after 10:30 p.m., it must be approved by the person in charge.
    Hero Liu loves vivid practical work, which is also what he has cultivated from his many years of worker life. Whenever there is a tense work moment, Hero Liu stays there day and night to direct, conduct propaganda and mobilization, and personally takes action when necessary. Once, an air raid alarm was sounded, and after Hero Liu arranged and evacuated everyone, he went to the radio station to personally control the nerve center of the entire factory.
  Opening the Spring of Creation
    Hero Liu has worked for decades, and he deeply knows that there are rich creative talents among the workers. He said: "At that time, workers were exhausted from working all day long. If they did well, there was no credit, and if there were problems, it was all the workers' fault. Who would have the heart to do better?" He always pays attention to inspiring the workers' active creative spirit. When he hears any good suggestions, he gives them enthusiastic support and encouragement. He regards this as a good key to overcoming difficulties and improving production. He likes to talk to workers whenever he has the opportunity. Workers are willing to tell him everything in their hearts. Once, the worker Zhu Zhimin talked to him: "I know that there is still a pressure reducing valve in our factory. If it is repaired and used, we don't have to burn the low-pressure furnace." Hero Liu was happy when he heard this, and Zhu Zhimin's suggestion was adopted. Because of the use of the pressure reducing valve, the high air pressure was adjusted, and the low-pressure furnace that wasted coal was shut down, saving more than 500,000 catties of millet a year.
    As soon as Hero Liu arrived at the Shijingshan Power Plant, he called on everyone to contribute their good skills. At the plant-wide employee meeting, he said: "In the old society, workers had to send money and gifts to the factory director during the New Year and holidays, but now, of course, it is not necessary; however, I, the factory director, hope that everyone will send more rationalization proposals. What we need most is this thing." In a few months, the plant received hundreds of rationalization proposals.
  "Technical Personnel and Workers are Like Airplanes and Airports"
    Many technical personnel at the Shijingshan Power Plant were most troubled in the past by sitting in the office to manage technical administrative work. Sometimes, even if they went to the site, they still could not delve into their work because they were very alienated from the workers.
    Hero Liu knew that to effectively improve production, it was necessary to mobilize all technical forces and achieve close cooperation between technical personnel and workers. He often emphasized that technology and workers should learn from each other. He said: "Technical personnel and workers are like airplanes and airports. Neither can do without the other."
    When solving certain important technical problems, forming special teams of technical personnel and experienced workers and discussing and studying together regularly is a good way to combine theoretical and practical experience and complement each other. The method of sitting in the office has now been changed for technical personnel, and they have been assigned to certain technical positions.
    In the past, technical personnel and workers often had disputes over certain technical issues. Due to the narrow-mindedness and one-sidedness of leading cadres, the problems could not be properly handled. Hero Liu always dealt with such problems with a pragmatic and scientific attitude. He paid special attention to not obliterating the due achievements of technical personnel, respecting technical personnel, and often humbly learning from them.
  The Trade Union is My Home
    There are often such administrative leaders: when they talk, they always say "relying on the working class"; but in reality, they do not take the workers' own organization - the trade union - seriously. On the contrary, they say that the trade union is causing trouble for the administration, and the trade union cadres are not up to the job. But in Hero Liu's place, there will never be such problems. Hero Liu pays great attention to the unity of the party, government, labor union, and youth league in his work, and he especially cares about the labor union. He said: "The labor union is my home, and the party is my mother. How can I do without them?" He knows that if the labor union can unite the entire working class, there will be a way to produce. He is very considerate of the difficulties of trade union cadres and pays attention to establishing the prestige of the trade union. He said: "The trade union has no money and no power. If the administration does the good things first and gives the trade union only difficult things to handle, how can it work?" Trade union cadres feel that everything is easy to discuss and solve with Hero Liu. All issues related to employee welfare in the factory are handled by the trade union. Some things that should be done, even before the trade union cadres think of them, Hero Liu raises them first. The allocation of newly built dormitories in the factory is discussed by the trade union; when workers' houses are destroyed by heavy rain, Hero Liu follows the labor protection minister of the trade union to inspect each house; in the past, trade union cadres did not know how to lead production. After June, the trade union represented employees and signed a collective contract with the factory, launching a production competition, and the prestige and role of the trade union were greatly enhanced.
  A Factory Director Who Understands the Workers' Joys and Sorrows
    Hero Liu cannot help but feel heartbroken when he sees workers suffering. He often says: "These are all my own brothers, if we don't care about them, who will?" He loves the workers so much because he deeply tasted the oppression and suffering endured by the working class. He and the worker brothers are already connected in flesh and blood.
    When Hero Liu arrived at the Shijingshan Power Plant, he convened the first employee meeting, and he originally had a lot to say. But that day was very cold, and when he saw everyone standing in the wind and freezing, he quickly ended the speech. After the meeting, he said to others: "Everyone is freezing like that below, what are we still talking about above?" Later, he asked the trade union cadres why there was not even a suitable place to hold meetings. The trade union cadres explained to him that the higher authorities had difficulties and there was no money to build an auditorium. After talking, he criticized the trade union cadres: "Having difficulties is one thing, but you didn't even think about this matter, and you didn't solve it with other methods. This is not caring about the workers' suffering."
    One night, Hero Liu heard that a worker had been crushed by a car, and he immediately wanted to go and see. Because it was raining and the road was far, he could not go. Hero Liu was very uneasy when he went to bed. The next day, before anyone got up, he heard Hero Liu yelling in the yard, helping to carry the injured workers.
    Hero Liu is always paying attention to the health and safety of employees. When signing a collective contract with the entire plant, he listened quietly to the reading of the contract clauses. When he read the words "ensure no accidents," he blurted out: "Add: including personal accidents at the back." Others explained that the original itself included this meaning. But he insisted that it be noted in this way, so as to attract everyone's attention even more. In his feeling, the safety of production and the safety of the person are equally important. Once, the comrades in the propaganda department drew several people on a painting to illustrate the achievements of the competition in several departments. The two lagging departments were drawn with: one person injured his leg, holding a crutch; one person injured his arm, hanging in a bandage. Hero Liu passed by the gate and strongly opposed seeing such paintings. He said: "Why draw it like this for everyone to see? Isn't it good to draw it in another way?"
    On a rainy day, Hero Liu saw workers working in the rain, their cotton clothes were soaked through, and they were shivering from the cold, but they did not slacken their work. Hero Liu felt heartache again when he saw this situation. A few days later, he still blamed himself and said: "This is all because our administration has not fulfilled its responsibilities. We should have prepared raincoats for the workers working in the open air long ago. The health of the workers is important. What if they get sick from the rain?"
    After Hero Liu arrived at the Shijingshan Power Plant, he went to see the houses where the workers lived. He saw that many houses were small and leaky, and some old couples and young couples were squeezed on the same bed. He thought that once it was windy and rainy, the workers would think of their families, how could they work with peace of mind? At that time, a part of the houses had been built in the factory, which was prepared to be used as offices and for employees. Hero Liu immediately distributed it to the most needy workers. He said: "We haven't solved the problem of workers living in leaky houses, so can we still use them as offices?" Now, with the approval of the higher authorities, they have successively repaired and built some new houses, but Factory Director Liu's office is still in that small house modified from a broken warehouse.
    The workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant said: "Our hero factory director knows our joys and sorrows. It is a pleasure to have such a confidant factory director, no matter how tired we are!" (Attached picture)

　　中国工人的光荣
    ——记工人出身的厂长刘英源
    林沫
    他从工人中来，深深了解工人的生活、思想和要求，他知道如何启发群众的积极性。他受了现代工业集体性的锻炼，办事迅速，善于决定问题、组织力量、深入检查，劳动纪律严格。
    刘英源是新中国的优秀的来自工人中的厂长。他的事迹说明了中国工人阶级管理工业的光辉才能和智慧。
    刘英源在旧社会曾受尽了压迫和折磨。他十一岁即开始到关东的英美烟草公司作包装工；以后，他放过猪，整天为饥饿所迫，到处去做杂活，卖零工；十四岁他又到工厂当学徒，一直和机器在一起三十多年。
    一九四六年哈尔滨解放后，刘英源从亲身的体验中，逐渐认识到中国共产党所领导的人民政府和军队是真正为人民谋利益的，他感到一向被反动统治阶级踏在脚下的工人阶级已经翻身作了主人，他就带领着哈尔滨发电厂的工人弟兄，克服严重的技术和设备困难，日以继夜地工作，苦想焦思，高度发挥了工人阶级的创造性，完成了艰巨、复杂的修复工作，使哈尔滨八十万人民得见光明，使紧张为前线生产的工厂得到电力。刘英源曾三次被选为劳动英雄——从此，大家都喊他“刘老英雄”！
    刘老英雄以后被提拔为哈尔滨发电厂副厂长，并相继被调到长春发电厂、抚顺发电厂任副厂长，领导那里发电厂的恢复工作。一九五○年三月，来到首都石景山发电厂任厂长。
  消灭了一大敌人
    在过去，你到了石景山就会看到，发电厂的大烟囱整天滚滚地冒着黑烟。这黑烟真是遮天盖地，厂房内外、附近一带的村庄和田野经常落着黑黑的一层，下雪天地下也还是灰黑的。
    因为跑出这些黑煤烟，工厂每天要浪费五、六吨煤；人们天天吸进煤烟，弄得很多职工有了肺病；机器上到处落下煤烟，也很容易发生事故和危险。
    所以跑出这么多煤烟，是因为燃烧系统装置不科学，经磨煤机磨成的细煤粉未经全部燃烧，就从烟囱吹出去了。在解放以前，大家就常吵这东西太害人，有经验的老工人也想过办法，工程师们也研究过，但谁也没有好办法。解放以后，到处都在改进生产，电业局领导上和石景山发电厂的职工都提出设法解决跑煤烟问题，苏联专家也到现场研究并提出过改进的建议，但终因没那么一个人认真领导着办，煤烟照旧飞扬着。
    刘老英雄到石景山发电厂，和各方面交换了意见，就决心要办这件事。根据他的经验：如果能遇事发动职工的积极性和创造性，集中群众的智慧，许多想像不到的困难都可以克服。
    刘老英雄向大家提出：跑煤烟问题是石景山发电厂当前一大敌人！他一面通过各种会议进行酝酿，号召全厂职工多多提出办法；一面就召集技术人员和有经验的工人一次又一次地开会研究，特为此成立了专门研究小组，并宣布问题如能很好解决，将以二万斤小米进行奖励。
    在进行中，刘老英雄首先是根据苏联专家和工人曹金生、齐玉良及技术人员的意见，将煤粉机运转部分的通风口堵死，改成秘密循环，不再因进出冷空气而吹出煤粉，但这样只解决了问题的一半；进一步又组织磨煤机研究小组，研究煤粉二次入炉燃烧。由工人苏允塘、杜鸿昌建议改换入炉燃烧管，并进一步经过大家的补充修改，将他们设计的直形管改为裤衩形，改正了因直形管入煤量太拥而燃烧不透的毛病，改装试验结果，情形良好，跑煤烟的问题终告解决。计算这一改进，单烧煤一项一年即可节省二千多吨，大大减低了发电成本。
  认真检查，消灭事故
    “消灭事故，保证首都安全供电；生产合理化，减低发电成本。”这是刘老英雄来石景山发电厂时，上级给他的两大任务。为了消灭事故，他实行了严格的检查制度；事事明确责任，严明赏罚。
    石景山发电厂过去大小事故不断发生，每次事故发生后，一提到责任问题，常是互相推脱，上下埋怨，弄来弄去总是一笔糊涂账。
    刘老英雄针对这种情形，首先规定：事故发生后，五分钟内要报告厂长；半点钟要报告初步检查结果；每件事故都要彻底查明原因，分清责任。
    为了新制度的贯彻，刘老英雄常亲自主持会议进行检讨。有一次，看循环水泵的工人张庆富工作马虎，真空降落（表示水少）到零度，影响机器运转，他还不知道。事后检讨时，他还要推脱责任，吵着：“真空那里到零度？还有十七英寸高哪！”但是经过老英雄仔细查问和大家的揭发，张庆富不能不老老实实地承认了自己的错误。刘老英雄叫他写了检讨书送交工会，在墙报上公开批评，并给以调动工作的处分，这事立即传遍全厂。现在，“每件事故必须彻底追查责任”，这办法已被职工自觉地使用着。
    刘老英雄平常虽是那么痛爱着工人弟兄，但对那些破坏劳动纪律、工作马虎、对国家财产不负责的人是极其严格的。而对功过的赏罚也是非常严明的。
    六月五日，司炉赵锡泉看真空不仔细，水已经上够，他还去报告领班宋文英要求放水。宋文英得报后，未进行检查，即命令看水泵的工人开水泵，以致锅炉水满溢出，灌进汽机。
    事故查明后，赵锡泉、宋文英受到降薪、调职处分。但五号机领班李凤鸣、六号机领班蔡学成因发现情况后，谨慎小心，立即作了适当处理，避免大停电的事故，厂方则予以特别奖励。领导上这样认真办事，赏罚严明，为全体职工所传颂。
    经过不断地事后检查，大家的责任心空前提高了。刘老英雄更经常集中力量实行定期性的全厂大检查。有计划地对机器设备、运转及操作情形进行细密检查，互相参观，消灭各种可能发生的隐形事故。
  领导不是坐在办公室里
    刘老英雄在工作中所以能经常地抓住中心问题，是由于他能运用组织，实行集体领导，自己不犯事务主义。对各级干部，他充分付给他们以工作权力，让他们大胆负责地进行工作。他说：“一个厂长，绝不要把权限都揽在自己手上；要是每天离了厂长就不能办事那就糟了！”他工作时不是常常坐在办公室里。每天上班以后，他在一定的时间内阅读文件、报纸，听汇报，以后他就到各个现场去实地检查、了解工作的实际情况。
    他要办什么事情，总喜欢果断、迅速，遇上那些办事拖延的人，他常恨恨地批评他们。
    他非常反对开那种冗长而不解决问题的会议。过去大家常开会到深夜，使人疲倦不堪。刘老英雄就提出要精简会议。现在厂内党、政、工、团曾订有“会议合同”，并规定若在夜晚十点半以后召集职工开会，须经负责人审查批准。
    刘老英雄热爱着生动的实际工作，这也是他多年的工人生活所养成的。每当紧张的工作关头，刘老英雄就日夜不停在那里指挥，进行宣传鼓动，必要时就亲自下手。有一次放了空袭警报，刘老英雄把大家安排、疏散之后，就走上电台，亲自掌握全厂的神经中枢。
  打开创造的泉源
    刘老英雄干活干了几十年，他深深知道，在工人群众中有着丰富的创造才能。他说：“那时候工人一天累死累活，干好了没有功劳，出了毛病都是工人的不对，谁还有心往好处干呢？”他时时注意去启发工人的积极创造精神，听到有什么好的建议，就给以热情的支持和鼓励，他把这当成克服困难，改进生产的一把好钥匙。他有机会就喜欢找工人谈谈，工人心里有什么话都愿意同他讲，有一次，工人朱致墨同他谈：“我知道咱们厂里还放着一个减压汽门，若把他修理好，用上了，就可以不烧低压炉。”刘老英雄一听就高兴起来，朱致墨的建议被采纳了。由于使用减压汽门，调整了高气压，停烧了特别废煤的低压炉，一年可节省五十多万斤小米。
    刘老英雄一到石景山发电厂，就号召大家贡献自己的好本领，在全厂职工大会上他说：“在旧社会，过年过节工友们要给厂长送钱送礼拜门子，现在当然不用了；可是，我这个厂长却希望大家多送合理化建议，咱们最需要的是这东西。”几个月来，全厂收到了几百条合理化建议。
  “技术人员和工人，好比飞机和飞机场”
    石景山发电厂有很多技术人员过去最感苦恼的是坐在办公室里管理技术行政工作，有时虽也到现场，因为和工人十分隔阂，仍然不能深入工作。
    刘老英雄知道，要有效的改进生产，必须动员全部技术力量，作到技术人员和工人的亲密合作。他经常强调技术和工人要互相学习，他说：“技术人员和工人，好比飞机和飞机场，谁离了谁也不行。”
    在解决某些重要技术问题时，把技术人员和有经验的工人组成专门小组，经常在一起讨论研究，这是使理论和实际经验互相结合、互相补充的一种良好办法。对技术人员现在已经改变了坐办公室的办法，把他们分配到一定的技术岗位。
    在过去，技术人员与工人也常因双方在某些技术问题上发生争执，由于领导干部的思想狭隘及片面性，使问题得不到正确的处理。对这样的问题，刘老英雄总是以实事求是的科学态度来处理。他特别注意不要抹煞技术人员应有的功绩，尊重技术人员，经常虚心地向他们学习。
  工会是我的家
    常常有这样的行政领导干部：讲起来，他总是说“依靠工人阶级”；但实际对工人阶级自己的组织——工会，却不大当回事。反说工会给行政找麻烦，工会干部不顶事。但在刘老英雄那里，却永不会有这样的问题。刘老英雄在工作中很注意党、政、工、团的团结一致，他尤其关心工会。他说：“工会是我的家，党就是我的娘，我离开他们怎么能行？”他知道，如果工会能把全体工人阶级团结起来，生产就有办法。他很体谅工会干部的困难，注意建立工会的威信。他说：“工会一没有钱，二没有权，要是行政先把落好的事自己作了，净交些难办的事给工会，那怎么能行？”工会干部感到和刘老英雄在一起，什么事都好商量，好解决。厂内凡有关职工福利问题的解决，都经工会来办理，有些该办的事情，工会干部还没有想到，老英雄就先给提出来了。厂内分配新盖的宿舍，都经过工会讨论；工人的房子被大雨冲毁了，刘老英雄跟上工会劳保部长到各家去查看；过去，工会干部不晓得如何领导生产，经过六月份，工会代表职工和厂方订集体合同，发动起生产竞赛，工会的威信和作用都大为提高了。
  是这样懂得工人酸甜苦辣的厂长
    刘老英雄是一看到工人受痛苦，就由不得不心痛的。他常说：“这都是自己的哥儿弟兄们，咱再不关心谁关心？”他这样爱护工人，因为他深深尝受了工人阶级所忍受的压迫与痛苦，他和工人弟兄们已经在血肉上连成一体。
    刘老英雄到石景山发电厂，头一次召开职工大会，他本来有很多话要说。但是那天很冷，他看见大家站在风地里受冻，很快就把话结束了。散会后他同别人说：“大家在下边那样冻着，咱还在上边高谈阔论什么？”后来，他问起工会干部，为什么常开会连一个合适的地方都没有？工会干部还向他解释，说上级有困难，没钱盖礼堂。谈了以后，他批评工会干部：“有困难是一回事，但你们根本没想到这回事，不去用别的办法解决，这就是不关心工人的痛苦。”
    有天晚上，刘老英雄听说一个工人被汽车压坏了，他马上就要去瞧看。因为下着雨，路又远，没有去成。刘老英雄睡下来心里就很不安，第二天，一大早人都还没起来，就听见刘老英雄在院里嚷叫着，在帮助搬抬受伤的工友。
    刘老英雄随时都在注意着职工的健康和安全。在全厂签订集体合同时，他静静地听着宣读合同条文，当读到“保证不出事故”几个字时，他冲口说道：“要在后边加上：包括人身事故。”别人解释说，原文本身就包含这意思。但他坚持需要这样注明，以便更引起大家的注意。在他的感觉中，生产的安全和人身的安全完全是同等重要的。有一次，宣传工作的同志在一张画上画了几个人，说明几个部门竞赛的成绩。把两个落后的部门画着：一个人伤了腿，扶着拐杖；一个人伤了胳膊，吊着绷带。刘老英雄从大门口经过，看见这样的画就大加反对，他说：“为什么要画成这个样子给大家看呢？画成别的样子不好吗？”
    下雨天，刘老英雄看见工人在淋着雨干活，棉衣都湿透了，冻得直哆嗦，但却并没因此松懈了工作。刘老英雄看见这情形又心痛了，过后几天，他还自责地说：“这全是咱们行政上未尽到责任，早就该给露天干活的工友准备下雨衣，工友的健康要紧，淋病了怎么办？”
    刘老英雄到石景山发电厂以后，就去查看工友住的房子。他见很多房子又小又漏，有的老两口、小两口挤在一个炕上。他想到，一遇刮风下雨，工友们就惦念起一家老小来了，怎么还能安心生产呢？当时厂内已盖了一部分房子，是准备留作办公室和职员用的，刘老英雄就立即把它分配给最急需的工友住了。他说：“工友们住着漏天的房子不解决，我们还能拿来作办公室？”现在，经过上级的批准，他们已陆续修盖了一部分新房子，但刘厂长的办公室，却还是在那用破仓库修改的小房子里。
    石景山发电厂的工人说：“咱们的英雄厂长是知道咱们的酸甜苦辣的，能有这样一个知心厂长，干活再累也痛快！”（附图片）
