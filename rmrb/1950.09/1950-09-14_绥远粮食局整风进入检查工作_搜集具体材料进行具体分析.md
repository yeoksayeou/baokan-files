    Suiyuan Grain Bureau's Rectification Enters Inspection Phase
    Collecting Specific Materials for Specific Analysis

    [Our Dispatch] The rectification movement of the Suiyuan Provincial Grain Bureau has entered the inspection phase. In the inspection work, the leadership of the bureau not only focused on the main problems in the major tasks but also mobilized everyone to collect specific materials and conduct specific analyses. The Grain Bureau's inspection work began on August 25th. After studying the documents, the bureau's cadres clarified at the beginning of the inspection that they should first focus on one or two major problems in their work and seek solutions to prevent aimless and rambling discussions. Therefore, the leadership decided to take last year's autumn grain collection and storage work as the first item for inspection. Last year, in Suiyuan East and Suiyuan South, when public grain was being put into storage, the responsible departments lacked planning, resulting in chaos in some grain depots and causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Therefore, the general cadres felt that this was the most important problem in the Grain Bureau's work.

    In order to make the inspection thorough and specific, the leadership, based on the storage situation last year, determined to focus on the four links where the most problems occurred: organization of transportation, grain quality inspection, variety distribution, and storage procedures. At the same time, in order to avoid the bias of not proceeding from the facts and making accusations based on impressions and feelings during the inspection, the bureau's leadership emphasized that materials should be obtained, situations analyzed, causes found, and rights and wrongs clarified in the inspection work. Therefore, at the beginning of the inspection work, the leadership first collected the instructions, notices, decisions, and various decisions on last year's storage work, as well as the following storage work reports, letters, and newspaper reports from the masses on the storage work. From these specific materials, it is possible to check whether the leadership's arrangements are correct and the execution of the following, so as to discover the main problems.

    In the first two days of inspection, it was quickly discovered that the most serious problem was the organization of transportation. For example, at that time, the Fengzhen sub-depot had as many as 130 grain trucks arriving at the depot every day, but the grain depot could not receive them due to the limitations of manpower and material resources. Some people waited for five or six days in a row but could not deliver the grain; the Taolin sub-grain depot asked farmers to continuously exchange grain five times due to grain quality problems, which seriously wasted people's labor. Based on these general problems, everyone, according to the spirit of the documents, first conducted an inspection on the leadership work. Because the materials were sufficient and the problems were concentrated, only two days of inspection revealed that the arrangement of last year's grain storage work was problematic. At that time, the Grain Bureau only took advantage of the opportunity when the county heads' joint meeting and the heads of the finance sections of various counties went to the province, and temporarily convened the heads of the finance sections of various counties, and hastily deployed the storage plan within two hours without discussion. Although the cadres accepted the task, they were not clear in their thinking. As a result, some counties and districts did not implement the storage work, and some even fell into chaos. Another loophole in the deployment work was that the leadership at that time believed that the task was urgent, and only urged the districts and depots to complete the storage task as soon as possible, without specifying the specific procedures and methods for storage. As a result, many problems occurred, and some grain depots were altered by individual backward elements to reduce the amount of grain handed over due to the lack of formal procedures.

    Although the above situation is only a preliminary inspection of the Grain Bureau, judging from the inspection methods and the problems initially exposed, this is a good start to the Grain Bureau's inspection work.

　　绥远粮食局整风进入检查工作
    搜集具体材料进行具体分析
    【本报讯】绥远省粮食局的整风运动已进入检查工作阶段。在检查工作中，该局领导上不但抓住了主要工作中的主要问题，并发动大家搜集具体材料，进行具体分析。粮食局的检查工作是从八月二十五日开始的。经过了学习文件，该局干部在检查开始时已明确了：首先应抓住工作中的一两个主要问题，求得解决，以防漫无边际的乱扯。于是领导上确定把去年秋征入库工作，作为检查的第一项。去年绥东绥南在公粮入库时，因主管部门缺乏计划，部分粮库陷于混乱，并引起群众不满。因之一般干部均感到这是粮食局工作中的最重要问题。
    为了使检查深入具体，领导上根据去年入库情况确定以组织运送、粮食质量检查、品种分配及入库手续等四个发生问题最多的环节为检查重点。同时为了避免检查中发生不从事实出发，凭印象、凭感觉乱加指责的偏向，该局领导上强调在检查工作中，应占有材料，分析情况，找出原因，弄清是非责任。所以在开始检查工作时，先搜集了领导上对去年入库工作的布置、指示、通报、各项决定，以及下面的入库工作报告、来信和报纸上群众对入库工作的反映。从这些具体材料中，就可以检查领导上的布置正确与否，及下面的执行情况，以便从中发现主要问题。
    在头两天的检查中，很快发现了其中最严重的是组织运送问题。例如当时丰镇分库每日到库的运粮车曾多至一百三十多辆，而粮库由于人力物力的限制，收不过来。有的群众一连等了五六天还缴不上；陶林分粮库，因粮质问题，叫农民连续调换五次，都严重的浪费了民力。根据这些带有一般性的问题，大家又根据文件精神，首先从领导工作上进行检查。因为材料充分，问题集中，仅仅两天的检查，便发现了去年粮食入库工作的布置是有问题的。当时仅是由粮食局趁县长联席会议时、各县财政科长到省机会，临时召集了各县财政科长，在两小时内未经讨论，就草率地把入库计划布置下去了。干部虽然接受了任务，但思想上并未明确。结果有些县区就没有把入库工作贯彻下去，有的甚至陷于混乱。布置工作中的另一漏洞是：当时领导上认为任务急迫，只催促各区库赶快完成入库任务，而没有规定出入库的具体手续和办法。结果发生了很多问题，有的粮库因无正式手续，被个别落后分子涂改斤秤少交粮食。
    以上情况虽只是粮食局的初步检查，但就检查方法及初步暴露出的问题看，这是粮食局检查工作的一个良好开端。
