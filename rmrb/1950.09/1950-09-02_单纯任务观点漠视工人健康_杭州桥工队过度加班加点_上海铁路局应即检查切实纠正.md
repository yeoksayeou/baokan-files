　　Simple Task View Disregards Workers' Health
    Hangzhou Bridge Team Overworks
    Shanghai Railway Bureau Should Immediately Inspect and Rectify
    [Our Newspaper] The Hangzhou Bridge Team of the Shanghai Railway Bureau excessively overworks, damaging the health of workers.
    In the month of June, the Hangzhou Bridge Team's affiliated repair shop, with one hundred workers, accumulated a total of two thousand eight hundred and nine overtime hours, of which fourteen workers each worked between fifty and sixty-six overtime hours. The team's first and second detachments, with sixty-eight workers, accumulated three thousand one hundred and sixty-four overtime hours, averaging sixty-four point six overtime hours per person. These figures are based on the overtime pay statistics and do not include voluntary labor. On June 19th, when the team was erecting Bridge No. 18, Gu Shaotang, the deputy leader of the first detachment, worked continuously for seventy-two hours without sleeping, and many workers did not return home for three days and three nights. On June 25th, when erecting the Qingyang River Bridge, work started at four o'clock in the morning and only ended at nineteen o'clock.
    Due to excessive overtime work, the health of the workers has generally declined. Taking June as an example, in one detachment of the team, the number of sick workers reached 30 percent. In the repair shop, out of one hundred workers, twenty-six took sick leave. On July 12th, the bureau's hospital examined the bodies of thirty-five workers in the team and found that thirty-four had symptoms of "excessive fatigue, chest pain, and dietary imbalances," with only one person healthy. According to a survey by the Hangzhou Railway Trade Union, 80 percent of the team's workers had a reduced appetite. Odd-job worker Wang Yigen died of a perforated stomach on July 6th. According to the diagnosis of the Zhejiang Provincial Hospital in Jinhua, the cause of the disease was: the body suddenly suffered excessive depletion, resistance was weak, and the interval between mealtimes was too long. Many workers in the repair shop had red and swollen eyes due to overwork.
    Why did such a serious situation arise? The main reason is that the leading cadres of the bureau's engineering department did not make overall considerations for the tasks assigned by the Ministry of Railways, and the task arrangements were loose at the beginning and tight at the end. The bridge team's tasks for the second quarter increased more than threefold compared to the first quarter, but the leadership did not ask whether it could be completed, simply saying, "The task must be completed!" After the tasks were assigned, the construction charts were delayed, so that a month's tasks were crammed into the second half of the month. Moreover, unnecessary projects were also included in the second quarter's tasks. For example, the Qingyang River Bridge had already been reinforced in May and did not need to be replaced with a steel girder bridge, but the engineering department stipulated that it should be replaced with a steel girder bridge in June. The cadres of the Hangzhou Bridge Team and the Hangzhou Railway Sub-bureau knew that the tasks were too heavy, but they did not dare to raise objections to the engineering department. The chairman of the Hangzhou Railway Trade Union also blindly called on the workers to overfulfill the tasks without analyzing and studying the actual situation. At that time, the workers reflected that the tasks were too heavy and their bodies could not bear it. Squad leader Liu Changyun said: "If we work even harder, people will fall into the river, and the bridge will also fall into the river." The cadres of the Hangzhou District Trade Union turned a deaf ear to this.
    Editor's Note: Overtime work is a common and serious problem in the railway system. This newspaper has repeatedly reported and criticized this erroneous practice, but it has not yet attracted widespread attention from various units in the railway system. The fact that the health of the workers of the Hangzhou Bridge Team of the Shanghai Railway Bureau has declined due to overwork once again proves that the practice of blindly encouraging workers to work overtime is wrong. The formation of the phenomenon of overtime work is mainly due to the bureaucratic work style of the leading cadres, who cannot formulate practical production plans, scientifically and rationally allocate and organize production, resulting in loose work tasks at the beginning and tight at the end, and workers have to work overtime to rush work. And they do not care about the health and safety of workers at all, which is not allowed. It is hoped that the leaders of the Shanghai Railway Bureau will inspect the work of the bureau's engineering department and earnestly correct this unreasonable and reckless work style.

### 单纯任务观点漠视工人健康  杭州桥工队过度加班加点  上海铁路局应即检查切实纠正

　　单纯任务观点漠视工人健康
    杭州桥工队过度加班加点
    上海铁路局应即检查切实纠正
    【本报讯】上海铁路局杭州桥工队过度地加班加点，损害工人健康。
    在六月份一个月内，杭州桥工队所属修配厂一百人，共加班两千八百零九小时，其中十四人每人加班五十小时至六十六小时；该队第一、二分队共六十八人，加班达三千一百六十四小时，每人平均加班六十四点六小时。这些数字是根据支付加班费统计的，还不包括义务劳动在内。六月十九日，该队架十八号桥时，第一分队副队长谷韶堂连续工作七十二小时，没有睡觉，许多工人三天三夜未回家。六月二十五日架青洋江桥时，从四点钟开始工作，到十九点才收工。
    由于过度地加班加点，工人健康普遍下降，以六月份为例，该队某分队生病的工人达百分之三十，在修配厂一百名工人中，请病假的就有二十六人。七月十二日，该局医院检查该队三十五名工人的身体，发现三十四人有“疲劳过度、心口疼痛、饮食不调”的病症，仅一人无病。根据杭州区铁路工会的调查，该队有百分之八十的工人食欲降低。杂工汪义根因患胃穿孔于七月六日病亡。据金华浙江省立医院诊断病源是：身体突遭过度耗损，抵抗力薄弱，饮食时间间隔太长所致。修配厂许多工人因疲劳过度，眼珠红肿。
    为什么会产生这样严重的情形呢？主要是该局工务处领导干部对于完成铁道部给予的任务，未作通盘考虑，布置任务前松后紧。桥工队的第二季任务竟比第一季增多三倍以上，领导上却不问是否能完成，只是说：“一定要完成任务！”任务布置下去后，却迟迟不发施工图表，以致一个月的任务都挤在后半月去做。而且将不必要的工程也列入第二季任务中。比如青洋江桥在五月份已经加固，不需要再换成钢梁桥，但工务处却规定要在六月份换成钢梁桥。杭州桥工队和杭州铁路分局的干部明知道任务过重，也不敢向工务处提意见。杭州区铁路工会主席也不根据实际情况，加以分析研究，就盲目号召工人超额完成任务。当时工人纷纷反映任务过重，身体吃不消，班长刘昌云说：“再要加紧干的话，人要倒在河里去了，桥也要倒在河里去了。”杭州区工会干部对此置若罔闻。
    编者按：加班加点是目前铁路系统中普遍而严重存在的问题，本报曾屡有报道，批判这种错误的作法，但仍未引起铁路系统各单位普遍的注意。上海铁路局杭州桥工队工人由于过度疲劳，健康程度下降的事实，再一次证明盲目鼓励工人加班加点的作法是不对的。加班加点现象的形成，主要是由于领导干部中存在着官僚主义的工作作风，不能制订切合实际的生产计划，科学与合理的分配与组织生产，致使工作任务前松后紧，工人不得不加班加点突击工作。而对工人的健康与生命安全，毫不加顾惜，这是不能容许的。希望上海铁路局领导方面对该局工务处的工作加以检查，切实纠正这种不合理的蛮干作风。
