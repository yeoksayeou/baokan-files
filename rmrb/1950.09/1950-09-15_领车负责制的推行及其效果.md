　　The Implementation and Effects of the Vehicle Responsibility System
    Zhang Daye
  (1) The Situation Before the Implementation of the Vehicle Responsibility System
    The Hubei Provincial State-Owned Automobile Transportation Company was a bureaucratic enterprise inherited from the Kuomintang reactionaries. Before the implementation of the vehicle responsibility system, there was serious chaos, waste, and irresponsibility. Here are some typical examples:
    I. The 12 trucks of the Northern Hubei cotton transport team spent an average of 230,000 yuan on repairs every day, while each truck traveled less than 40 kilometers on average per day.
    II. Driver Xu Xiuchun damaged a large tire, two cylinder head gaskets, one cylinder head, one battery, and one bottom bracket within a month, and damaged a section of a civilian's wall, causing losses of nearly 10 million yuan.
    III. The first time transporting cotton and grain in Northern Hubei was delayed for 59 days, with compensation of 100,000 yuan per day. The second time transporting 380,000 jin of cotton, over 3,300 jin were lost, half of which was compensated, and the other party still threatened to sue. Grain transport in Southern Hubei was delayed for seven days, with compensation of 1 million yuan per day. Two incidents of damage occurred during grain and oil transport in Eastern Hubei, causing dissatisfaction among cargo owners.
    IV. There was no standard for fuel distribution. The Wuhan Company reimbursed actual expenses. In Northern Hubei, one gallon only traveled three kilometers. However, there were also fuel savings, but there was no administrative reward after turning it in.
    V. When a car broke down, even for minor repairs, it was sent to the main factory. No one asked about it for ten days or half a month. The factory also put it aside because materials were not readily available. For a small part, the car sat in the factory for a month or two. Technicians were also careless in repairing cars. After a major overhaul, the piston pin rattled after driving a few hundred miles. Technician Liu Ruoquan installed kingpin bushings and steel bowls of different sizes together, causing the tire to fall off when reversing in Huangpi. Fortunately, no one was killed.
    VI. The station adopted a "waiting for customers" attitude towards passengers and cargo. Drivers were even less concerned about whether there was cargo or not. For each task, the stationmaster had to persuade the driver. The driver made excuses that the travel expenses were not enough and refused to drive without borrowing money. The stationmaster had no choice but to use ticket money to approve receipts indiscriminately, so the cashier withdrew receipts instead of cash.
  (2) The Content of the Vehicle Responsibility System
    In order to eliminate this series of disorganized and undisciplined phenomena, we tried to implement the vehicle responsibility system.
    The vehicle responsibility system is based on the principle of benefiting both public and private interests and rewarding hard work, and it uses the piece-rate wage system as its foundation. Fixed drivers use fixed vehicles and are responsible for driving and maintenance. Public and private interests can be completely aligned under this system.
    Organizationally, three drivers form a group, adopting the method of individual responsibility and joint guarantee. Each person receives a car from the company. It is stipulated that each group must hire at least one technician and two to three assistants; however, they must be hired from the company's existing personnel.
    Based on preliminary cost calculations, a mileage fee of 0.2 yuan per vehicle kilometer is paid. Recently, due to the increase in the monthly mileage of automobiles, the mileage fee has been changed to 0.15 yuan per vehicle kilometer for gasoline vehicles and 0.17 yuan for charcoal vehicles.
    In order to guarantee the workers' minimum living standards, assuming that they are completely idle for one month, they are given a daily standby fee or repair fee (minor repairs not included) of 0.02 yuan per vehicle.
    Vehicle maintenance work is divided into major, medium, and minor repairs. Minor repairs are the responsibility of the driver, while major and medium repairs are the responsibility of the company. It is stipulated that a medium repair should be done every 3,000 kilometers and a major repair every 6,000 kilometers (charcoal vehicles: a medium repair every 2,500 kilometers and a major repair every 5,000 kilometers). If the vehicle needs a major or medium repair before reaching the standard mileage, the repair cost allocated based on the mileage shortfall is borne by the driver. If the standard mileage is reached and the vehicle still meets the good condition standards after inspection, the repair cost allocated for the excess mileage will be awarded to the driver. The cost of a major repair is stipulated as the price of 60 gallons of gasoline, and a medium repair is 20 gallons. The calculation formula is as follows: Bonus or compensation = (mileage driven - stipulated mileage) × repair cost / stipulated mileage.
    The materials needed for minor repairs are sold by the company to the driver at a 10% discount from the market price, and technical assistance and guidance are provided. If the vehicle is damaged accidentally through no fault of the driver, the company and the driver will jointly determine the responsibility and handle it.
    Fuel and lubricants are determined according to the oil consumption standards for various years, makes, and tonnages. An 80% rate is given for the return trip without cargo. Fuel savings are purchased by the company at the listed price, and excessive consumption is compensated by the driver at cost.
    The service life mileage standards for tires and major components are also stipulated separately. If the damage occurs before the mileage standard is reached, the driver will compensate for the price allocated based on the mileage shortfall. If the standard is exceeded, they will also receive a reward.
    When there are no passengers or cargo at the station, the vehicle responsible driver can solicit business independently, but it must not be lower than the prescribed freight rate, and the station will handle all the formalities.
    When each vehicle signs a contract with the company, a vehicle history manual is issued, the main contents of which include a handover list, driving record, mileage fee payment, tire replacement, and maintenance records.
  (3) Trial Implementation Process
    The company convened its first business meeting at the end of March and decided to implement the vehicle responsibility system on a trial basis. Initially, everyone had the following questions and concerns:
    1.  They believed that the vehicle responsibility system was no different from the "contract car system" of the Kuomintang era. As long as the car was pushed out the door, nothing else mattered, and they only waited to collect freight. Drivers did not believe that the leadership would benefit or give preferential treatment to the workers, and they thought that the company was using this method to reduce workers' wages. Some cadres believed that once there were no passengers or cargo and business was slack, drivers would steal and sell parts like the "contract car system," ruining the vehicles.
    2.  Drivers were concerned that the roads in Hubei were bad, the vehicles would break down, there was no guarantee of passengers and cargo, and coupled with their own poor skills, they were afraid of taking responsibility and afraid of not getting their original scores.
    3.  Cadres were also concerned that after the drivers took charge of the vehicles, they would become independent from the leadership, be difficult to manage, and disobey commands. They could not let go and did not believe that the workers had enthusiasm and creativity, thinking it was too early to implement until the workers' political awareness was raised.
    4.  Individual drivers agreed with this method, but they did not believe that the leadership could persist, and they were afraid that the station would not be able to help the drivers overcome possible difficulties.
    After repeated mobilization and education, it was explained that our vehicle responsibility system was essentially no different from the past "contract car system." The "contract car system" was indeed exploitative of workers, while we were taking into account both public and private interests and were beneficial to workers. Now the vehicles belong to the working class themselves, not to the bureaucrats and the four major families as in the past. The administration repeatedly guarantees the minimum living standards of the workers and tries its best to solve the difficulties for the drivers, determined to persist in this system, and calls on all cadres to thoroughly clarify the idea of "relying on the workers to run the enterprise well."
    Preparations were made in advance, cooperating with the trade union comrades, finding active elements, helping to repair the vehicles, and equipping them with tools, first making typical demonstrations and concentrating on key breakthroughs.
    On April 12, the first group, Ouyang Jian and Huang Shifang, signed a contract and started going to Southern Hubei. At first, some backward elements tried to obstruct or attack them. However, the first group persisted with the support of the administration and showed excellent performance day after day. The facts educated these backward elements. Then the Li Jiaxi group and the Sun Zhixiang group signed contracts. Wang Guohua, the driver in Wuhan who opposed it the most, was specially invited to listen when the second group signed the contract; after returning, he automatically took charge of a vehicle. Coordinating with the transport of 4.5 million jin of grain in Southern Hubei, the administration and the trade union began planned and organized transportation, turning all vehicles participating in grain transportation into a vehicle responsibility system. The whole company quickly developed to 52 vehicles, developing from typical demonstration to a comprehensive trial implementation with the Wuhan branch company as the unit.
  (4) The Effects After the Trial Implementation of the Vehicle Responsibility System
    1. Production enthusiasm and work efficiency have been unprecedentedly improved - mainly reflected in the increased vehicle turnover rate. For example, Wei Zhicheng traveled 2,016 kilometers in eight and a half days, with an average daily travel of 268.8 kilometers, exceeding the standard daily travel mileage by 80 kilometers 3.3 times. The round trip from Tongshan to Xianning is 126 kilometers, and the original plan was to complete the task of one million jin of grain in 20 days. As a result, it was completed in seven and a half days, 12 and a half days ahead of schedule. Huang Zhongming and other vehicles in Tongcheng grain transport continuously traveled 340 kilometers per day, setting a new record. Drivers rushed to complete tasks every day "before dawn and after dusk," and refused to rest until 12 o'clock in repairing cars. The leadership forced them to rest for a day, but everyone was unwilling. Later, they agreed and still inspected and repaired vehicles all day, forgetting to eat because they were so busy. Ouyang Jian automatically solicited cargo and traveled 498 vehicle kilometers, accounting for about 30% of the total mileage. In order to meet the needs of merchants to rush for time, he transported them overnight. During several rains in the grain transport in Southern Hubei, the oilcloth was not good, so the drivers paid for mats to cover it themselves, and sewed up the broken grain bags themselves. Carrying 1 million jin of grain from Tongshan, not a single jin was missing.
    2. Reduce waste and lower transportation costs - Drivers are generally able to take good care of vehicles and save materials and gasoline. For example, when Wang Qingchun encountered bad roads, he and his assistant would get off the car every ten or twenty kilometers to check the car to prevent damage. Yin Dingfa's group pre-drilled 24 clips to prevent broken steel plates. Ouyang Jian only spent 30 points on minor repair costs in one month, which is half less than the original fixed minor repair quota of 60 points. When 31 vehicles traveled 23,000 kilometers in four days of Tongcheng grain transport, the average minor repair cost for all vehicles was only ten points per 1,200 kilometers (standard mileage). Even with accidental damage such as broken axles and flat tires, it was only 30 points, which was still ten points less than the newly set standard minor repair cost of 40 points. Good vehicle maintenance, coupled with careful driving, naturally saves fuel. The 14 vehicles in Tongshan saved a total of 105 gallons of fuel in seven and a half days. Usually, the group automatically studies how to save fuel and protect vehicles. When the bottom bracket of Chen Zhuqing's car broke, there were no materials for a while, so everyone studied a way to finally repair the car. Due to good vehicle maintenance, extended service life, reduced repair costs, faster task completion, increased monthly transport volume, the proportion of operating income increased accordingly, management costs were relatively reduced, and freight rates could gradually be reduced, reducing the burden on shippers, and the company's business could be further expanded and developed.
    3. Workers' income increased and work enthusiasm improved - For example, Ouyang Jian's personal income in one month was 156 points, an increase of 28 points compared to the original maximum of 128 points for drivers, plus a saving of 5 gallons of gasoline, which could be more than 200 points. Not only did the drivers' income increase, but the company's income also increased a lot.
    4. Unity is also better. Many drivers can actively unite technicians and assistants in their work, and unite station and maintenance personnel. For the necessary mutual assistance, the unity between the vehicle responsible groups has also increased. This was fully demonstrated in the grain transport in Southern Hubei. As soon as a car broke down, other cars would automatically help. For improving engineering, station affairs, maintenance, materials, etc., many people have put forward various reasonable suggestions, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers.
    5. Promoted the work of other departments:
    a. Engineering - The drivers watched the bad roads in Southern Hubei, and the loss of gasoline, tires, and parts, and automatically used their spare time to repair the roads. Return vehicles automatically transported stone ballast, and everyone worked together to repair three bridges. The comrades in the engineering team were too embarrassed to neglect, and also worked on the road day and night; they were moved by the Fourth Field Army vehicles going to transport, and also brought stones back when returning.
    b. Repair - Drivers personally do ordinary minor repairs, and no longer let assistants do it casually. Ouyang Jian also did the medium repair of his car himself. The cars entering the factory are taken care of all day long. The cars leaving the factory are inspected again and again. Technician Wei Huiyuan said: "This time, car repair can't be sloppy at all!"
    c. Station affairs - In the past, the station had to find drivers for passengers and cargo, but now the drivers ask the stationmaster if there are passengers and cargo as soon as they arrive at the station, urging them to load, drive on the road, and sign for procedures, and the work at the station has also become tense.
    d. Materials - The materials for ordinary minor repairs are bought by the drivers themselves from the company at a 10% discount. Because the drivers know the market price of the materials and the quality of the goods, they cannot be deceived, which makes the purchasing staff more responsible. The drivers also want good materials for major and medium repairs, with long service life mileage, durable and durable, reducing repair and replacement time.
  (5) Difficulties and Problems
    However, the implementation of the vehicle responsibility system is not without difficulties at present. These difficulties need to be overcome in the future:
    (1) Engineering - The engineering situation of Hubei highways is not good. The road surface is bad, and most of them have no road surface. Of the 6,756 kilometers of highways in the province (including national highways), only 1,516 kilometers can pass smoothly, 2,092 kilometers can pass in sunny weather but not in rainy weather, and 3,148 kilometers cannot pass. The quality of the route has a great impact on automobile transportation. It takes only 1.20 points to drive 45 kilometers from Tongcheng to Chongyang because the route is good. It takes 2.45 points to drive 39.5 kilometers from Chongyang to Zhao Liqiao because the route is bad. The time is more than one point and 25 minutes less for driving 5 kilometers, and the difference in fuel and parts consumption is more than doubled. This will affect the quota and standards. Actively improving engineering is one aspect. On the other hand, we want to change various standards and quotas in special circumstances.
    (2) Vehicles - We have 15 brands of vehicles, including cars from 1936. The difference in vehicle quality is the biggest obstacle to the vehicle responsibility system. Good vehicles have many advantages. For example, the International Car can make three round trips from Tongcheng to Zhao Liqiao, 85 kilometers, while other cars, no matter how hard they try, can only make two round trips. Drivers with good cars can rest more after transportation, while drivers with bad cars have to repair them as soon as they arrive at the station, so drivers can only sleep for two or three hours. Moreover, bad cars use more materials, consume more fuel, and run less mileage. In the future, we plan to try our best to take care of and help drivers with bad vehicle conditions, and try to improve the quality of car repairs.
    Other issues include the relationship between the accompanying technicians and assistants and the drivers: because the company takes the driver as the head of the vehicle, and the salaries of the technicians and assistants are paid by the driver, they seem to become the driver's employees, and their mood is not good. After the drivers take charge of the vehicles, they rarely give assistants the opportunity to practice their skills, which also makes the assistants dissatisfied. The administration has re-determined the salary payment method for technicians and assistants, stipulating that technicians have the responsibility to ensure the vehicle is in good condition and to guide the driver in the use and maintenance of the vehicle, and are directly responsible to the company. Drivers should also try their best to help their assistants improve their skills.
    These difficulties can be constantly overcome in practice.

　　领车负责制的推行及其效果
    张大野
  （一）未实行领车负责制以前的状况
    湖北省营汽车运输公司，是从国民党反动派手里接收过来的官僚企业机构。在未实行领车负责制以前，存在着严重的混乱、浪费与不负责任的现象。下面是一些典型例子：
    一、鄂北运棉十二部车，每天平均要花二十三万修理费。而每日每车平均行驶不足四○公里。
    二、司机徐修春一个月内损坏大轮胎一个，汽缸床二张，汽缸盖一个，电瓶一只，底脚一个，碰坏老百姓墙一块，损失近千万。
    三、鄂北运棉花与粮食，第一次延搁了时间五十九天，每天赔款十万元。第二次运棉花三十八万斤，少了三千三百多斤，赔了一半，人家还要控告。鄂南运粮，延期了七天，每天赔款一百万元。鄂东粮运及运油共二次损坏，引起了货主机关的不满。
    四、油料没有发给标准，武昌公司实报实销，鄂北一加仑只走三公里。但也有节余油料，缴公之后，行政上没有奖励。
    五、车子坏了，就是小修也往总厂送，十天八天不去问，厂里因为材料不就手，也摆下来，为了一个小零件，车子在厂个把月。技工修车也很马虎，大修车走几百里，活塞梢子就发响，技工刘若泉把羊角弹子与不同尺寸的钢碗装在一起，在黄陂倒车时轮胎脱落，幸亏没出人命。
    六、站上对客货抱“等人上门”的态度，司机更不关心有货无货，每次任务，站长去找司机说好话，司机借口出差费不够吃，非借钱不开车，站长只好动用票款乱批条子，结果提款员提回的不是现款，而是条子。
  （二）领车负责制的内容
    为了消灭这一连串无组织无纪律的现象，我们便试行领车负责制。
    领车负责制系根据公私两利多劳多酬这一原则，而以计件工资制度作为它的基础，以固定的司机，使用固定的车辆，由其负责行驶保养。公私利益在这一制度上是完全可以得到一致的。
    组织上，以三个司机为一组，采个人负责，联合担保的办法，每人向公司领车一辆。规定一组，至少聘请技工一人，助手二人——三人；但必须在公司现有人员内聘用。
    根据初步的成本计算，每车公里发给里程费○·二分，最近因汽车月行里程提高，里程费因之改为油车每车公里○·一五分，木炭车为○·一七分。
    为保证工人的最低生活，假定一个月完全不开动，给予每日每车的待班费或待修费（小修不计）二分。
    车辆保养工作，区别修理为大、中、小修，小修由司机负责，大、中修由公司负责，规定每三千公里中修一次，六千公里大修一次（木炭车二千五百公里一中修，五千公里一大修，）若车辆不及标准里程，即需大、中修时，按其不足里程所摊得的修理费，由司机负责，到达标准里程，经检验车辆仍合完好标准，其超过里程，应摊得的修理费用，则奖予司机。大修费用规定为六十加仑汽油价，中修为二○加仑，其计算式如下：奖金或赔偿＝（行驶里程－规定里程）×修理费用／规定里程
    小修所需材料，由公司照市价九折优待售给，并予技术的帮助与指导，如非司机过失车辆的意外损坏，公司与司机双方鉴定责任后处理。
    油润料照各种年份厂牌吨位的不同定出油料标准，回空八折发给，节省油料由公司照牌价收买，超耗的由司机照价赔偿。
    轮胎及主要机件使用寿命里程，也分别规定行驶里程标准，不足里程的损坏由司机照不足里程应摊得的价格赔偿，超过则同样受奖。
    领车司机，在车站无客货时，可自动招揽，但不得低于规定运价，并由站办理一切手续。
    每车在向公司订合同时，发给车历手簿一本，主要内容包括交接清单，行车纪录，里程费支付、轮胎更换与修理保养等纪录。
  （三）试行经过
    公司在三月底召开了第一次业务会议，决定试行领车负责制，最初大家存在着下列的问题与顾虑：
    １、认为领车负责制和国民党时期的“包车制”没有区别，只要把车子推出门，什么都不管了，只等收运费。司机不相信领导会对工人有什么利益与便宜，以为公司用这个办法来减低工人的薪水。有些干部同志认为一旦没有客货，营业清淡，司机会像“包车制”一样，盗卖零件，把车辆搞垮完事。
    ２、司机顾虑湖北路线坏，车辆坏，客货没有把握，再加上自己的技术不佳，怕负责任、怕拿不到原来的分数。
    ３、干部还顾虑司机领了车，就会向领导上闹独立，不好管，不听指挥，不能放手，不相信工人有积极性与创造性，以为太早了，要等到工人政治觉悟提高才能实行。
    ４、有个别司机赞成这个办法，但不相信领导上能坚持下去，又怕站上不能帮助司机克服可能发生的困难。
    经过反复的动员教育，说明我们的领车负责制与过去的“包车制”本质上没有任何相同的地方，“包车制”确实是剥削工人的，我们是公私兼顾，对工人有利的。现在车辆是工人阶级自己的，不是像过去属于官僚和四大家族的，行政上一再保证工人的最低生活，并尽力替司机解决困难，决心把这个制度坚持下去，号召全体干部彻底明确“依靠工人搞好企业”这一思想。
    事先作好了准备工作，与工会同志配合，找好了积极分子，帮助修好了车辆，配齐了工具，先作典型示范，集中突击。
    四月十二日第一小组欧阳坚，黄士芳签订了合同，开始到鄂南去。起先有一些落后分子，曾企图阻碍，或打击他们。但是第一组由于行政撑腰，坚持下去，一天一天有优异的成绩表现，事实教育了这些落后分子。接着李家喜组，孙志祥组签了合同。武昌反对最厉害的司机王国华，当第二组订合同时，特地请他来旁听；回去之后，他就自动领了车。配合着鄂南粮运四百五十万斤，行政与工会开始有计划有组织的运输，把所有参加运输粮的车辆都搞成领车负责制，全公司一下子发展到五十二辆，由典型示范发展为以武昌分公司为单位的全面试行。
  （四）领车负责制试行后的效果
    １、生产情绪与工作效率空前提高——主要表现在车辆运转率增加。如魏志成八天半行驶二，○一六公里，平均每日行车二六八·八公里，超出每日标准行驶里程八○公里三·三倍。通山到咸宁往返一二六公里，一百万斤粮，原定二十天完成任务，结果，七天半完成，提前十二天半。通城运粮，黄中明等数车，连续每日行车三四○公里，创了最高纪录。司机每天“两头黑”赶任务，修车到十二点不肯休息，领导上强迫休息一天，大家不愿意，后来答应了，仍旧整天检修车辆，忙得忘了吃饭。欧阳坚自动招揽货物走了四九八车公里，约占全里程百分之三十，为着商客要求赶时间，他连夜赶运。鄂南运粮中几次下雨，油布不好，司机自己出钱买席子遮盖，粮包破了自己缝补，承运通山一○○万斤粮食，一斤也没有缺少。
    ２、减少浪费，降低运输成本——司机都普遍能爱护车辆，节约器材汽油，如王庆春遇到坏路，走十公里二十公里就同助手下来看看车子防止车子损坏。尹定发小组预先打了二十四个卡子，防备断钢板。欧阳坚一月只花小修费三○分，较原定小修定额六○分少一半。通城运粮四天，三十一辆车行驶二三，○○○公里，所有车辆小修费，平均每一，二○○公里（标准里程）只花小修费十分，加上意外的损坏，如断轴炸胎等，也不过三十分，较新定标准小修费四十分，仍少十分，车辆爱护好，加上开车小心，自然就省油，通山十四部车七天半就共省油一○五加仑。平时小组自动研究如何节省油料及保护车辆，陈竹青的底脚坏了，一时没有材料，大家研究出办法，终于，把车子修好了。由于车辆保养好，寿命延长，修理成本减少，任务完成快，每月运量增加，营业收入比例随而增加，管理费相对减少，运价也因此可以逐渐降低，使托运者减轻负担，公司营业也因而更扩大发展。
    ３、工人收入增加，工作积极性提高——例如欧阳坚一个月本人收入一五六分，较原来司机最高一二八分增加二八分，再加上节省汽油五加仑，约可得二百分以上。不仅司机收入增加，实际上公司的收入也增加得很多。
    ４、团结也好了。很多司机都能在工作中主动的去团结技工与助手，去团结站务、机务人员，为着必要的互相帮助，同时也增加了各领车小组间的团结，鄂南运粮中充分的表现了这一点，一有车子抛锚，别的车子便自动去帮助。对于改善工程、站务、机务、材料等方面，许多人提出了各种合理的建议，充分表现了工人的积极性与创造性。
    ５、推动了其他部分的工作：
    ａ、工程——司机眼看着鄂南路不好，汽油、轮胎、机件受损失，自动利用空余时间来修路，回空车自动带运石碴，大家动手修好了三座桥梁。工程队的同志再不好意思疏忽，也日夜在路上工作；感动了同去运输的四野军车，回空也带石头。
    ｂ、修理——司机对于平时小修都亲自动手，不再放心助手去弄，欧阳坚车的中修也自己搞。进厂的车，自己整天去照应。出厂的车，自己检验又检验。技工魏浍元说：“这下子修车可不能有一点马虎了！”
    ｃ、站务——从前站上有客货要去找司机，现在司机一到站就问站长有没有客货，催着装催着开路签办手续，站上工作也紧张起来。
    ｄ、材料——普通小修的材料都是司机自己出钱向公司九折买进，因为材料的市价与东西的好坏，司机心里有数，瞒不了他们，使采购人员必须更多负责任。大中修的材料，司机也要好的，寿命里程长，经久耐用，减少修理拆换时间。
  （五）困难问题
    但是，目前施行领车负责制也不是完全没有困难的。这些困难还有待于今后去克服：
    （一）工程——湖北公路，工程情况不好，公路路面坏，多数是无路面，全省公路六，七五六公里（国道在内），能畅通的只有一，五一六公里，晴通雨不通的二，○九二公里，不通的三，一四八公里。路线的好坏，对汽车运输影响很大，通城到崇阳四五公里，路线好，行车只要一点二○分。崇阳到赵李桥三九·五公里，路线坏，行车要二点四十五分。少行五公里，时间多一点二十五分，油料机件耗损相差还不止一倍，这样就会影响定额与标准。积极的改善工程是一方面，另一方面我们想在特殊情况下改变各种标准与定额。
    （二）车辆——我们车辆有十五种厂牌，还有一九三六年的车子，车辆好坏不同，是领车负责制最大的一个障碍，好的车辆占便宜的地方很多，例如通城至赵李桥八十五公里，万国车可以走三个单回，其他的车子，无论如何努力也只能走二个单回。车子好的司机运完可以多休息，坏车一到达站就得修，修得司机只能睡两三个钟头。并且坏车花的材料多，耗的油料多，跑的里程又少，今后准备尽力照顾，帮助车辆情况不好的司机，并尽力提高修车的质量。
    其他如随车技工助手与司机的关系问题：因为公司以司机为首领车，技工与助手的薪金由司机开支，好像成为司机的雇佣者，情绪不好。司机领车后，很少给助手练习技术，也使助手不满，行政上已重新确定技工助手的支薪办法，规定技工有保证车辆完好行驶并有指导司机的使用车辆与保养的责任，直接向公司负责。司机对助手也应尽力帮助其在技术上进步。
    这些困难完全可以在实践中不断加以克服的。
