　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: The Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League originally planned to convene the National Propaganda Conference of the Youth League in October, but has decided to postpone it to next spring. The meeting issued a postponement notice on the 13th. The main reasons for the postponement are: on August 3rd, the meeting had already announced the "Decision on Strengthening the Propaganda and Education Work of the League" and the "Provisional Outline of the Work of Propagandists." These two documents have made clear instructions on the basic direction of current propaganda and education work, and the Youth League committees at all levels have not had enough time to implement this decision and gain more experience in practical work.

　　青年团全国宣传会议决定延期至明春举行
    【新华社十五日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会原定于十月间召开的青年团全国宣传会议，决定延期至明春举行。该会已于十三日发出延期的通知。该会延期的主要原因是：八月三日该会已公布了《关于加强团的宣传教育工作的决定》和《宣传员工作暂行纲要》，该两文件对当前宣教工作的基本方向，已作了明确的指示，而各级团委还没有充分时间执行这一决定，和在实际工作中取得更多经验。
