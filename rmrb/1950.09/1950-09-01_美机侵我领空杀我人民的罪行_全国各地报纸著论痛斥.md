　　American Aircraft's Crime of Invading Our Airspace and Killing Our People
    Condemnation in Editorials in Newspapers Across the Country
            Northeast Daily
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 29th. The Northeast Daily here published a commentary on the 29th, protesting the crime of American aircraft invading our airspace and slaughtering our people. The commentary pointed out: It has been exactly two months since the American imperialists and their running dog, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, launched the war of aggression against Korea, and the United States immediately dispatched its Seventh Fleet to invade Taiwan. Thanks to the heroic resistance of the Korean military and civilians, and the sympathy and support of the people of the world, the American invading forces in Korea have suffered serious defeats and are sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire. No matter how frantically the American imperialists struggle, the final victory of the Korean people is certain. Under these circumstances, in order to reverse its determined defeat, American imperialism has resorted to inhumane means, carrying out cruel and barbaric bombings of Korean cities and villages, causing casualties to many peaceful people. In Taiwan, American imperialists are constantly strengthening their aggressive forces. In the Security Council, American imperialists disregard the just calls of the people of the world and refuse to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. The events of the past two months have fully exposed the aggressive crimes of American imperialism. This behavior constitutes a threat to the cause of world peace. This provocation and brutal act of American military aircraft invading our airspace once again reveals the deliberate attempt of American aggressors to undermine peace and security in Asia and the world. The commentary stated: We fully support Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's protest and demands to the US government, as well as Foreign Minister Zhou's complaint and suggestions to the United Nations Security Council. The US government should bear full responsibility for this crime of violating our sovereignty and slaughtering our people, and its consequences. The US invading forces in Korea must immediately and completely withdraw from Korea. The people of Northeast China, along with the people of the whole country, are concentrating their efforts and devoting themselves to construction, while the atrocities of the American aggressors are attempting to undermine our peaceful life with the world. We are a people who have already achieved great revolutionary victory. No threat from American imperialism can scare us. We can only be more vigilant and work harder to intensify production and strive for our unwavering goals, which is to oppose American imperialist aggression, liberate Taiwan and Tibet, and defend the borders of our motherland.
            Shanghai Jiefang Daily (Liberation Daily)
    This newspaper reports: The Shanghai Jiefang Daily published a commentary, condemning the American imperialists' acts of armed provocation. The Jiefang Daily editorial pointed out: The war of aggression against Korea launched by American imperialism and its running dog Li Chengwan, and the atrocities of the American air force invading our airspace, are entirely part of a pre-planned aggressive plan to undermine peace in Asia and the world. The editorial called on the people of East China and the people of the whole country to unite closely and fight against imperialist aggression and defend lasting world peace.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th. Shanghai Xinwen Daily (News Daily), Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial), and Wenhui Daily today unanimously denounced the new provocations and brutal acts of the military aircraft of the American invading forces in Korea invading our airspace and strafing our people.
            Shanghai Xinwen Daily (News Daily)
    Xinwen Daily's editorial said: We feel infinite anger. In particular, the people of Shanghai who suffered the large-scale bombing by American-made bandit planes on February 6 this year, seeing that the old blood debts have not yet been repaid, and new blood debts of the Northeast compatriots have been added, have increased their hatred for American imperialism even more. The editorial pointed out: Linking the strengthening of the American imperialist naval and air force's military aggression against Taiwan with the atrocities of American planes attacking our Northeast territory, it is clear that the American imperialists' acts are part of a plan to provoke us. The editorial said: We absolutely support the serious protest that Foreign Minister Zhou has made to Acheson and the complaint that he has made to the Security Council. Blood debts must be repaid. The US government should bear full responsibility for the US Air Force's violation of our sovereignty and the killing of our people this time, and its consequences, which cannot be denied. The United Nations Security Council has the responsibility to maintain the sovereignty of all countries and international security and peace, and should immediately take measures to sanction this atrocity of American imperialism, and order the US government to completely withdraw its invading forces in Korea, which cannot be shirked.
            Shanghai Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial)
    Ta Kung Pao pointed out in its editorial: The provocative act of American aircraft crossing the Yalu River and invading Chinese airspace is clear evidence of America's attempt to expand the war and undermine peace. The editorial continued: The American aircraft that invaded Chinese airspace are part of the American invading forces in Korea. The American invading forces in Korea should withdraw immediately. If they do not withdraw, they may continue to commit provocative crimes against China. The editorial pointed out: In addition to the indiscriminate bombing of Korean civilians, the American Air Force has now invaded Chinese airspace and provoked China. This is by no means an accidental event, but a habitual theft of aggression and crime. We demand that the Security Council sanction and punish the perpetrators, and compensate for all losses; in addition to this, we must accuse the American imperialists' aggressive ambitions to the world, and condemn the brutal and beastly behavior of the American army. We protest against the provocative crimes of American aircraft, and at the same time call on the people of Asia and the world to rise up and defend peace in Asia and the world.
            Shanghai Wenhui Daily
    Wenhui Daily's editorial said: This is the most arrogant provocative act of American imperialism against our country. American imperialism, trapped in an adventurous war from which it cannot extricate itself, clearly intends to expand its fierce flames in order to reverse the war-weariness of the American people, cover up the embarrassing appearance of its failure in Korea, and create an atmosphere of international terror and anxiety. The editorial said: For the despicable and brutal acts of the American robbers, we demand that the actions of the people of the whole country issue a serious warning.
            Hankou Changjiang Daily (Yangtze Daily)
    Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 29th. Hankou Changjiang Daily and Dagang Bao (Ta Kang Pao) both published commentaries on the 29th regarding the American aircraft invading our airspace. The commentary of Changjiang Daily said: Now the facts have proved that the American imperialists are not only shamelessly invading Korea, but have also stretched their dirty beastly mouths into our solemn and sacred national boundary. The people of the whole country must be highly vigilant and strictly prevent this attempt by imperialism to expand the war and undermine peace.
            Hankou Dagang Bao (Ta Kang Pao)
    Dagang Bao expressed serious protest in its commentary against the new provocative acts of American imperialism. The newspaper pointed out: "If the US government brazenly disregards this, and does not open its eyes to see the strength of the Chinese people and the determination of the people of the world who love peace and oppose aggression, then it will eat its own bitter fruit."
            Chongqing Xinhua Daily
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 30th. Chongqing Xinhua Daily and Ta Kung Pao both published commentaries on the 30th protesting the American aircraft invading our Northeast airspace.
    Xinhua Daily wrote: We must liberate the places that have not yet been liberated, and we will never allow American imperialism to occupy them; we will resolutely defend the places that have been liberated, and we will never allow American imperialism to invade them.
            Chongqing Ta Kung Pao (L'Impartial)
    Ta Kung Pao wrote: American imperialism has become an enemy of our 475 million Chinese people. The result of such recklessness is only self-destruction. The newspaper said: American imperialism is isolated. It has set up countless enemies, stretched its battle lines, and exposed its weaknesses. The more frantic it becomes, the closer it gets to death. The history of its predecessors - Hitler, Tojo, etc. - eloquently points out that its future is a dead end.
            Chongqing Xinmin Daily (New People's Daily)
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 29th. Chongqing Xinmin Daily published an editorial on the 29th entitled "Stop the Provocative Crimes of American Imperialism," stating: The provocative acts of the American imperialists will absolutely not scare us. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, the heroic Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have sufficient strength to defend their national sovereignty and safeguard international peace. Our 475 million people across the country will unite closely under the leadership of our Central People's Government and resolutely oppose the criminal acts of American aircraft invading our airspace and killing our compatriots. Xinhua Daily, Ta Kung Pao, and Xinmin Daily here today all published on the front page in a prominent position the telegrams of Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the US government and complaint to the Security Council regarding the American aircraft invading our Northeast, and published the full text of the People's Daily editorial in Beijing.
            Guangzhou and Hong Kong Newspapers
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th. Newspapers in Guangzhou and Hong Kong published commentaries on the atrocities of American imperialist aircraft invading our airspace and killing our compatriots, unanimously protesting the provocative acts of American imperialism. Guangzhou Nanfang Daily (Southern Daily) condemned the atrocities of American imperialism in its editorial and firmly supported Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the US government. Guangzhou Lianhe Bao (United Daily) called on patriotic overseas Chinese to unite and oppose the aggressive acts of American imperialism in its editorial. The Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao editorial stated: American imperialism must bear full responsibility for this provocative act. It is not only the drivers and shooters of the US Air Force who should be punished, but also the senior military commanders of the United States in the Far East. The Hong Kong Wenhui Daily editorial pointed out: American imperialism is taking advantage of the opportunity to invade Korea to invade our airspace and kill our people. This proves that the barbarous acts of American imperialism in invading Korea have seriously affected China's security. Therefore, for the safety and interests of the Chinese people, and for the safety and interests of the people of the Far East and even the world, the United Nations Security Council should immediately order and take effective measures to require the US government to completely withdraw its invading forces in Korea.

　　美机侵我领空杀我人民的罪行
    全国各地报纸著论痛斥
            东北日报
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】此间东北日报于二十九日发表时评，抗议美机侵入我国领空、残杀我国人民的罪行。时评指出：自从六月二十七日美帝国主义者及其走狗李承晚匪帮发动侵略朝鲜战争，美国并随即派遣其第七舰队侵入台湾以来，已经整整两个月了。由于朝鲜军民的英勇抗战，和全世界人民的同情声援，美国侵略朝鲜军队，遭受了严重失败，泥淖愈陷愈深。不管美帝国主义者如何疯狂挣扎、朝鲜人民的最后胜利则已确定。在这种情势下，美国帝国主义者为了挽回其已确定的失败颓势，采取了绝灭人性的手段，对朝鲜的城市和乡村，进行了残酷的野蛮的轰炸，使许多和平人民遭受伤亡。在台湾，美帝国主义者则在不断地加强其侵略武装。在安理会中，美帝国主义者竟漠视全世界人民的正义呼声，拒绝和平解决朝鲜问题。两个月以来的事变，充分暴露了美国帝国主义者的侵略罪行。这种行为，已构成了对世界人民和平事业的威胁。这次美国军用飞机侵入我国领空的挑衅和残暴行为，再一次表露了美国侵略者蓄意破坏亚洲和世界的和平与安全。时评表示：我们完全拥护周恩来外长向美国政府的抗议和要求，以及周外长向联合国安全理事会的控诉和建议。美国政府应对此次侵犯我国主权及残杀我国人民的罪行担负全部责任及其后果。美国侵略朝鲜军队必须立即完全撤出朝鲜。东北人民和全国人民一起，正集中精力，投入建设事业，而美国侵略者的这种暴行，则企图破坏我们与世界的和平生活。我们是已经取得伟大革命胜利的人民，美帝国主义者的任何威胁，绝不能吓倒我们，我们只有更加警惕，更加紧张的加紧生产和努力工作，为我们坚定不移的目标而奋斗，这就是反对美帝国主义的侵略，解放台湾、西藏，保卫祖国的边疆。
            上海解放日报
    【本报讯】上海解放日报发表评论，斥责美帝的武装挑衅行为。解放日报的社论指出：美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚发动侵略朝鲜的战争，和美国空军侵入我国领空的暴行，完全是预定的破坏亚洲和世界和平的整个侵略计划的一部分。社论号召华东人民和全国人民紧密地团结起来，为反对帝国主义侵略、保卫世界持久和平而奋斗。
    【新华社上海二十九日电】上海新闻日报、大公报、文汇报本日一致痛斥美国侵略朝鲜军队的军用飞机侵犯我国领空，扫射我国人民的新的挑衅和残暴行为。
            上海新闻日报
    新闻日报的社评说：我们感到无限愤怒。特别是遭受过今年二月六日美制匪机大轰炸的上海人民，看到旧血债还没有索还，又添上东北同胞新的血债，更增加了对美帝国主义的仇恨。社评指出：把美帝国主义海、空军加强对我台湾的军事侵略联系起来看，美机袭击我东北领土的暴行，显然是美帝国主义向我挑衅计划的一部分。社评说：我们绝对拥护周外长已向艾奇逊提出的严重抗议和已向安理会提出的控诉。血债必须偿还，美政府对美空军此次侵犯我主权及残杀我人民的行为，应担负全部责任及其后果，不容狡赖。联合国安理会负有维护各国主权以及国际安全与和平之责，应立即采取措施，制裁美帝国主义这种暴行。并下令美政府完全撤退它在朝鲜的侵略军队，不容诿卸。
            上海大公报
    大公报在社评中指出：美国飞机越过鸭绿江，侵入中国领空的挑衅行为是美国企图扩大战争，破坏和平的明证。社评继称：侵入中国领空的美国飞机，是美国侵略朝鲜军队的一部分。美国侵略朝鲜的军队应立即撤退。若不撤退，可能继续发生对中国的挑衅罪行。社评指出：美国空军在滥炸朝鲜平民以外，这次又侵入中国领空，对中国挑衅。这绝不是偶然的事件，而是侵略犯罪的惯盗了。我们要求安理会制裁、惩办犯罪者，赔偿一切损失；除此而外，必须向全世界控诉美帝国主义侵略的野心，谴责美军的残暴兽行。我们抗议美机的挑衅罪行，同时号召亚洲及世界人民起来，保卫亚洲及世界的和平。
            上海文汇报
    文汇报的社论说：这是美帝国主义对我国最狂妄的挑衅行为。美国帝国主义陷在冒险战争中无法自拔的侵略狂，显然企图扩大凶焰，来一面扭转美国人民的厌战情绪，掩饰在朝鲜失败的狼狈神态，并制造国际间恐怖不安的紧张空气。社论说：对于美国强盗这种卑鄙残暴的行径，我们要求拿出全国人民的行动力量发出严重警告。
            汉口长江日报
    【新华社汉口二十九日电】汉口长江日报、大刚报二十九日均就美国飞机侵入我国领空事发表评论。长江日报的评论说：现在事实已证明美帝不仅无耻地侵略朝鲜，而且已把它那肮脏的兽嘴伸入我庄严神圣的国界之内。对于帝国主义这种扩大战争破坏和平的企图，全国人民必须提高警惕，予以严防。
            汉口大刚报
    大刚报在评论中对美帝国主义新的挑衅行为表示严重抗议。该报指出：“美国政府如竟悍然不顾，不睁眼看看中国人民的力量以及全世界爱和平、反侵略人民的决心，那它就要自食其果。”
            重庆新华日报
    【新华社重庆三十日电】重庆新华日报、大公报均于三十日发表评论抗议美机侵我东北领空。
    新华日报写道：未解放的地方，我们一定要解放，决不容美帝国主义霸占；已解放的地方，我们坚决保卫，决不容美帝国主义侵犯。
            重庆大公报
    大公报写道：美帝国主义已与我四万七千五百万中国人民为敌，这样蛮干的结果，只有自取灭亡。该报称：美帝国主义是孤立的，它树立了无数的敌人，拖长了战线，暴露了弱点，它愈疯狂就愈接近死亡。它的前辈们——希特勒、东条等人的历史，雄辩地指出它的前途，只有死路一条。
            重庆新民报
    【新华社重庆二十九日电】重庆新民报二十九日以“制止美帝国主义的挑衅罪行”为题发表社论称：美帝国主义者的挑衅行为是绝对吓不倒我们的。英勇的中国人民和中国人民解放军在毛主席与共产党的领导下有足够的力量来保卫自己国家的主权和维护国际和平。我全国四万七千五百万人民将紧密地团结在我中央人民政府的领导之下，坚决反对美机侵犯我国领空残杀我同胞的罪恶行为。此间新华日报、大公报、新民报今日均在一版头条显著地位刊载周外长对美机侵我东北向美政府提出的严重抗议和向安理会提出的控诉电文，并刊载北京人民日报社论全文。
            广州、香港各报
    【新华社广州三十日电】广州、香港各报对美帝飞机侵入我国领空及残杀我同胞的暴行发表评论，一致抗议美帝的挑衅行为。广州南方日报在社论中斥责美帝的暴行，坚决拥护周外长对美国政府提出的严重抗议。广州联合报在社评中号召海外爱国华侨一致起来反对美帝的侵略行为。香港大公报社评称：美帝对此次挑衅行为，必须负完全责任。应受惩办的不仅是美国空军的驾驶员和射击手，还得加上美国在远东的高级军事指挥官。香港文汇报社论指出：美帝借着侵略朝鲜的机会，侵犯我领空，残杀我人民，这证明美帝侵略朝鲜的野蛮行为，已严重地影响中国的安全。因此，为了中国人民的安全与利益，为了远东人民以至世界人民的安全与利益，联合国安理会应立即下令并采取有效措施，要美国政府完全撤退其在朝鲜的侵略军队。
