　　Technician Guo Jinyu's Creative Talents
　　Guo Jinyu is a technician at the power plant of the privately-owned Suzhou Electric Factory. He has worked at the Suzhou Electric Factory for eleven years. Guo Jinyu is usually very active in production and is willing to use his brain to find solutions. Therefore, his work is fresh and full of creativity.
　　The bushing (i.e., bearing shell) of the suction fan on the high-pressure furnace in the Suzhou Electric Factory was originally made of copper. The friction with the shaft was very high, and it often became scorching hot after running for a long time. In this way, the bushing and the shaft were easily worn out, and they had to be repaired and replaced several times a month; and it often needed oiling, using about two pounds of turbine oil a day. If this situation was not changed, the life of the motor would also be affected. Guo Jinyu actively used his brain to find a way to transform it. He proposed it to the factory, and the factory accepted it. Guo Jinyu and another worker then worked together to replace the copper bushing with a ball bearing bushing, designing and manufacturing it themselves. Because the friction of the ball bearing bushing is small, the wear of the bushing and the shaft is reduced, and it is no longer necessary to add oil frequently. Since the ball bearing bushing was retrofitted, the bushing and the shaft have not been damaged once in eight months. After transforming the bushing of the suction fan, he also led the workers to collect and sort waste materials, and made a cold oil tank by himself. The cold oil tank can reduce the oil temperature of the turbine generator, which is very helpful for safe operation. In the past, cold oil tanks were all made abroad, but now Guo Jinyu made it himself from waste materials.
　　Guo Jinyu is a good worker with rich experience and creativity. But in the past, under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, his talent was never valued. For example, when the motor was first installed in the Suzhou Electric Factory, something went wrong. The engineer flipped through thick foreign books and disassembled the machine for three days, but it was all in vain. In the end, he just fiddled with a small place and fixed it in just over ten minutes.
　　After the liberation of Suzhou, although the creative talent of this excellent technician has been discovered, the trade union and the factory have not paid enough attention to his talent, so that his talent cannot be fully utilized. Therefore, many of his good suggestions have not been implemented. For example, he once suggested raising the grate in the low-pressure boiler a little, which could save more than six tons of coal per day (because the boiler is manufactured according to the combustion performance of higher quality coal blocks, but now the coal used in the factory is of poor quality, and the firepower often cannot reach the top, thus wasting the firepower; after raising the grate, coal can be saved). But this suggestion was not adopted by the factory. Another example is the Siemens turbine in the factory. Because it has been used for a long time, many of its blades are damaged. These blades are all made abroad. Guo Jinyu is very interested in manufacturing blades. He said: "We Chinese can definitely make them too." He took the old blades home and studied them for three days and three nights, and then expressed confidence in making them himself, guaranteeing that they could be used for two years, and that there would be no collisions like now. His bold and courageous attempt was not encouraged.
　　Guo Jinyu was not disappointed because he was not valued. He firmly believes that the Communist Party relies on the working class. From his own experience, he deeply realized that a new China cannot be built without good technology. He is even more convinced that the Chinese working class is capable of mastering modern technology. Therefore, Guo Jinyu has been working hard to improve existing technology and master modern technology.

### 技工郭金余的创造才能

　　技工郭金余的创造才能
    郭金余是苏州市私营苏州电气厂发电所的技工，他在苏州电气厂工作已经有十一年了。郭金余平时生产很积极，又肯动脑筋想办法。因此，他的工作有新鲜的、丰富的创造性。
    苏州电气厂的高压炉上吸风器的婆司（即轴瓦）原来是铜的，和地轴的磨擦力很大，开久了往往热得烫手。这样，婆司和地轴很容易被磨坏，一个月总要修理、调换好几次；而且时常需要加油，一天总得加二磅左右的透平油。这样的情况不改变，马达的寿命也受到影响。郭金余就积极动脑筋想办法把它改造一下。他向厂方提出来，厂方接受了。郭金余就和另外一个工友，一起想法把铜婆司换成弹子婆司，自己设计翻制。因为弹子婆司的磨擦力小，婆司和地轴的损耗就小了，也不用时常加油了。从改装弹子婆司以后，八个月来，婆司和地轴从未坏过一次。改造了吸风器的婆司后，他又领导工人收集、整理废料，自己制造了一只冷油缸。冷油缸能够减低透平发电机的油温，对运转安全很有帮助。过去冷油缸都是外国制造的，现在郭金余自己用废料把它造出来了。
    郭金余是有丰富经验、有创造性的好工友。但在过去国民党反动派统治时，他的才能从没有被人重视过。譬如在苏州电气厂刚安装马达时，出了毛病。工程师翻遍了厚厚的洋装书，把机器拆弄了三天，结果还是白费心。最后，还是他把一个小地方拨弄了一下，只花了十几分钟就修好了。
    苏州解放后，虽然这个优秀的技术工人的创造才能已被发现，但是工会和厂方对他的才能还没有足够的重视，使他的才能不能尽量地发挥出来。因此，他有许多好的建议没有实现。譬如，他曾提出把低压锅炉中的炉排升高一些，每天就可节省六吨多煤（因为锅炉是按照质量较高的煤块燃烧的性能来制造的，而现在该厂所用的煤质差，火力常常不能达到上面，因而浪费了火力；把炉排升高后，煤就可节省了）。但这个建议没有被厂方采纳。又如该厂的西门子透平，因为使用很久，叶子损坏很多。这些叶子都是外国制造的。郭金余对制造叶子发生很大兴趣。他说：“我们中国人一定也能造。”他把旧的叶子拿回家去研究了三天三夜之后，表示有信心自行制造，保证可用二年，并且还不会像现在那样发生撞击的现象。他这个大胆的、勇敢的尝试也没有得到鼓励。
    郭金余并没有因为不被重视而失望。他坚信共产党是依靠工人阶级的。从他的亲身体验中，他深刻的认识到没有好的技术是不能建设好一个新中国的。他更坚信，中国工人阶级是能够掌握现代化技术的。因之郭金余一直在为提高现有的技术，为掌握现代化技术而努力。
