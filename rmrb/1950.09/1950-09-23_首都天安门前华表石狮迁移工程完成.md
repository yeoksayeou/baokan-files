　　Tiananmen Square Huabiao and Stone Lion Relocation Project Completed
　　[This newspaper dispatch] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The relocation project of the Huabiao pillars and stone lions in front of Tiananmen Square was fully completed on the 21st, taking 28 days and using approximately 3,000 man-days. Because the relocation project was done very carefully, the Huabiao pillars and stone lions were not damaged in any way. After the relocation to the new site, the road in front of the Jade Belt River has been widened by twelve meters, which can facilitate traffic and enable large-scale parades to pass quickly in front of the Tiananmen rostrum. The Huabiao pillars and stone lions were successfully moved in four steps: first, the Zhacai (festive decorations) craftsmen built scaffolding and lifted them with chain hoists, then the stonemasons were responsible for moving them, and then they were installed on the new site, while the tilers were responsible for laying the concrete foundation and smoothing the seams. The Construction Bureau also sent engineers and workers to supervise the site all day long.

　　In this project, the tilers cooperated well, and they also flexibly helped with side work beyond their responsibilities; the stonemasons' relocation work was also done very well due to the use of small rails. The workers all felt that it was an honor to do this project to welcome the National Day, and they were all working enthusiastically. Some citizens were initially worried about the relocation of these antiquities, fearing that they would be damaged, but when they saw the Huabiao pillars and stone lions standing upright again intact, they all said, "It's really not easy, such heavy things weren't damaged at all!"

　　首都天安门前华表石狮迁移工程完成
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：天安门前华表、石狮的迁移工程已于二十一日全部完成，费时二十八日，约共用了三千余个人工。因为迁移工程做得非常慎重，华表、石狮都毫未受损。迁移新址以后，玉带河前的马路展宽了十二公尺，可以便利交通，使游行队伍能大量迅速地通过天安门检阅台前。华表和石狮是分四步迁移成功的：先由扎彩匠扎架用倒链吊起，再由石匠负责挪移，然后在新址上按装起来，瓦匠则负责打洋灰基、抹缝等工作。建设局并派工程师和工人终日在工地指挥。
    这次工程中，瓦匠配合得较好，在他们应负责的工作以外还机动地帮着做旁的工作；石匠的挪移工作由于使用了小铁轨，也做得很好。工人们都认为为了迎接国庆做这个工程很光荣，都很兴奋地工作着。有些市民在起初很担心这些古物的迁移，恐怕有损坏，但当他们看到华表和石狮又完好地竖立起来的时候，都说：“可真不容易，这么重的东西连一点都没损坏！”
