　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government issued a statement today saying: When the war criminal Soong Tzu-wen illegally occupied the government of Guangdong Province, he ordered the Guangdong Provincial Bank to purchase a batch of military supplies from Canada with the blood and sweat of the people. These materials are currently stored in the Tsing Chau warehouse in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Guangdong Provincial Bank, in its capacity as the owner of the goods, pays warehouse rent on a daily basis. The People's Government has ordered the bank to be responsible for safekeeping and await takeover. According to reliable sources: Taiwan remnant bandits recently ordered the bandit Zheng Jiemin to conduct secret activities in Hong Kong, attempting to steal this batch of military supplies. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government is closely monitoring this conspiracy. These materials are the property of the Chinese people and should be taken over by the Chinese People's Government. Any acts of theft, transfer, destruction, or condoning theft, transfer, or destruction will not be allowed.
