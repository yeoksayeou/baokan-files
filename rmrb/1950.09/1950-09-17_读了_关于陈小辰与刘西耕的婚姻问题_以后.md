　　After Reading "On the Marriage Problem of Chen Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng"
    Zhong Huaiqiong
    The marriage of Chen Xiaochen and Liu Xigeng was unreasonably obstructed by feudal backward thinking, bureaucracy, and commandism. Fortunately, after the exposure by the Tianjin Daily and the in-depth investigation and analysis by the Supreme People's Court, this pair of young working men and women got the opportunity to be together. This is a good example of handling marriage cases and a victory since the implementation of the People's Marriage Law.
    In order to implement the new Marriage Law, so that countless Chen Xiaochens and Liu Xigengs can get rid of the feudal shackles of thousands of years sooner, to cleanse our cadres of feudal backward thinking, bureaucracy, and commandism, to improve the policy level of cadres, and to encourage the people to rise up and fight for the realization of the new Marriage Law, we put forward the following opinions:
    1. The Tianjin Prefectural Branch Court and the Commissioner, the Ba County People's Court, the Sixth District Chief, and the Gedan Village cadres must seriously examine the Chen and Liu marriage case and publish it in the newspaper.
    2. Chen Ketang and others who obstruct the marriage freedom of Chen and Liu should be subject to the sanctions of the people's law.

　　读了“关于陈小辰与刘西耕的婚姻问题”以后
    钟怀琼
    陈小辰与刘西耕的婚姻，横遭封建落后思想与官僚主义、命令主义的无理阻梗。幸而经过了天津日报的揭发，最高人民法院的深入调查和分析研究，使得这一对劳动青年男女得到了结合的机会。这是处理婚姻案子的一个良好范例，也是人民婚姻法实施以来的一次胜利。
    为了贯彻新婚姻法，使无数的陈小辰和刘西耕们能够早一天摆脱几千年来的封建囚笼，清洗我们干部的封建落后思想与官僚主义、命令主义，提高干部政策水平，鼓舞人民起来为实现新婚姻法而斗争，我们提出如下意见：
    一、天津专署分院和专员、霸县人民法院、第六区区长、疙疸村村干，对陈刘婚姻案，必须认真检讨，并在报纸上公布。
    二、妨害陈刘婚姻自主的陈克堂等，应受人民的法律制裁。
