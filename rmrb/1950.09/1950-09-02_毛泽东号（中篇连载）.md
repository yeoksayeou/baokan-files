　　Mao Zedong Locomotive (Medium Length Serial)
　　(By Ding Kexin and Qingying)
　　　　Thirteen, "If others don't run, we will!"
　　Military transport is busy, there are few people and many trains.
　　Someone suggested: Attach a camping car, eat and sleep on the train, and insist on not going home.
　　Everyone agreed. ——Attach a camping car.
　　The greater the victory at the front, the busier the transportation at the rear.
　　Trains followed trains, like the flowing water of the Songhua River, flowing, flowing, constantly flowing!…
　　Day and night, people averaged less than ten hours of rest a day.
　　Their eyes were all bloodshot, and some would doze off while driving.
　　The old hero became more vigilant in the dark, constantly reminding everyone:
　　“We are bearing the heavy burden, so be extra careful!”
　　“Certainly!” People became alert.
　　From Harbin to Yimianpo, it's all uphill, and the coal isn't good, so the locomotive wheezes and can't climb if the steam is a little low.
　　The two stokers shoveled one shovel after another, burning more than twelve tons of coal for a round trip.
　　Their backs ached, their arms hurt, and they were so tired they couldn't straighten up.
　　Some people couldn't even eat after finishing their shift and fell asleep in the camping car.
　　Other locomotives were afraid of fatigue and cold, and were unwilling to run on Yimianpo: some said their locomotives were of poor quality and could not go uphill; some said their cylinders needed to be repaired and could barely run on flat ground.
　　“If others don’t run, we will!”
　　“We can’t lose heart, let’s run and show them!”
　　“Insist on running Yimianpo!”
　　“Strive for the second banner!”
　　The partners of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" were brewing, encouraging each other, and voluntarily proposed that they were willing to run on Yimianpo.
　　The more they did this, the stronger their morale became, and the better they did in all aspects of their work.
　　The stoker leveled the coal in the coal car before driving it to the coal platform, saving both time and effort; loading coal and water took no more than fifty minutes.
　　They didn't wait for orders to wait for the train, they always made the train wait for orders.
　　One day in November, it was forty degrees below zero, and saliva froze into ice as soon as it came out of the mouth, and shattered into pieces when it hit the ground. The old hero Li Yong, in order to keep warm, slept in the upper bunk of the camping car after his shift. He woke up in the middle of the night and mistakenly thought the floor was on fire, and in a daze, he quickly got up to put out the fire, forgetting that he was sleeping on the upper bunk, and fell! His face immediately swelled up, his lips were bleeding, and his arm was also broken.
　　Everyone advised him to take a few days off, but he shook his head:
　　“I am the driver, I cannot break the group convention, and I will never be absent from work!”
　　His lips were so sore he couldn't eat, so he used a lunch box to cook sorghum porridge to drink.
　　His left hand was injured and he couldn't move it, but he insisted on driving with only his right hand.
　　During the busiest time, he ran twenty-seven trips in a month.

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    （丁克辛轻影作）
        十三、“人家不跑咱们跑！”
    军运繁忙，人少跑车又多。
    有人提议：挂上一辆宿营车，吃饭睡觉都在车上，坚持不回家。
    大伙都同意。——挂上宿营车。
    前方胜利越大，后方运输越忙。
    列车接着列车，像松花江的流水，流，流，不断地流！……
    日日夜夜，人们一天平均休息不到十个钟头。
    眼睛都有了红丝了，有的开着车开着车就打瞌睡。
    老英雄越是黑夜，越是不放松，不断提醒大家说：
    “千斤担子咱担着，千万小心啊！”
    “错不了！”人们警觉起来。
    从哈尔滨到一面坡，全是上坡路，煤又不好烧，汽稍为不足机车就发喘爬不上去。
    两个司炉一锹连一锹，来回一趟就要烧十二吨多煤。
    腰酸，胳膊疼，累得直不起身子来。
    有的人交了班连饭也吃不下，躺到宿营车上就睡过去了。
    别的机车怕累怕冷，不愿意跑一面坡：有的说他们机车质量不好，上不了坡；有的说他们汽缸需要修理，跑平路还凑合。
    “人家不跑咱们跑！”
    “不能泄气，跑给人家看看！”
    “坚持跑一面坡！”
    “争取第二面奖旗！”
    “毛泽东号”的伙伴们酝酿着，互相鼓励着，自动提出他们愿意跑一面坡。
    越这样，心气越盛，样样工作越往好里赶。
    司炉把煤车的煤平好了才开到煤台上煤，既省时间又省力；上煤上水不超过五十分钟。
    他们不叫命令等车，总叫车等命令。
    十一月的一天，零下四十度，唾沫出口就冻成冰，吐到地上摔成碎片。老英雄李永为了取暖，换班后睡到宿营车上层睡铺里。半夜醒来，误认炉火烧着了地板，迷糊中连忙起身去扑火，忘记了自己睡在上层，栽倒了！脸立时肿了起来，嘴唇出血，胳膊也摔破了。
    大家劝他请假休息几天，他摇摇头：
    “我是司机长，不能破坏小组公约，决不欠勤！”
    嘴唇烂了不能吃饭，用饭盒熬高粱米粥喝。
    左手跌伤不能动，坚持用一只右手开车。
    最紧张的时候，他一个月跑了二十七趟车。
