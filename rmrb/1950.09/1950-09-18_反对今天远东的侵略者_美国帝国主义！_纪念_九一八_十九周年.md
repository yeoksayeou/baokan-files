　　Today, we commemorate the 19th anniversary of the September 18th Incident amidst the great victory of the Chinese People's Revolution and the vigorous development of the people's movement in all countries to strive for peace and oppose war. At the same time, we commemorate the 19th anniversary of the "September 18th" Incident amidst the brutal aggression of American imperialism against Korea, the invasion of our territory Taiwan, and the further threat to the nations of Southeast Asia.
    American imperialism, this imperialism that took advantage of the anti-fascist Second World War and stole a large portion of the fruits of victory with relatively small losses, has now completely replaced Japanese imperialism in the East, and is even more brutal and ferocious than the former Japanese imperialism.
    American imperialism not only replaces Japanese imperialism as an aggressor now, but also supported and encouraged Japanese imperialism's aggression for a long period in the past. After the Japanese imperialists launched armed aggression in Northeast China on September 18, 1931, American imperialism was eager to make Japanese imperialism serve as a gendarme in the Far East against the Soviets, against the Communists and against the people. Therefore, while formally adopting an empty "non-recognition doctrine," it actually continued to encourage the development of Japanese aggression. Until December 8, 1941, before the outbreak of the Japanese-American War, much of the munitions and military supplies used by Japan for its war of aggression were supplied by the United States; Japan's establishment of a large-scale military production system and military base in Northeast China also received active assistance from the United States in terms of materials and technology. And since July 7, 1937, when Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale invasion of China, American imperialism continued to import a large amount of military industrial equipment and military raw materials such as gasoline and scrap iron to Japan, thereby increasing Japan's aggression. The purpose of the American imperialists in actively helping the Japanese aggressors at that time was to use Japan as a vanguard of counter-revolution in the Far East, and to seek a compromise between the two imperialisms. But unexpectedly, the Japanese aggressors launched the Pearl Harbor incident and took direct offensive action against the United States, which led to the outbreak of the US-Japan war. Due to Japan's defeat in World War II, American imperialism replaced Japan as the new aggressor in Asia, and completely controlled Japan, making Japan's reactionaries completely serve American interests.
    After Japan's surrender, American imperialism in the Far East actively supported the revival of Japanese fascist forces, conspiring to turn Japan into a tool for the United States to carry out new aggression in the Far East; on the one hand, it helped the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang launch a large-scale civil war and massacre the Chinese people. The common goal of the American reactionary policy in Japan and China was to turn Japan and China into its colonies and war bases. However, due to the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, this evil plan of American imperialism was defeated. Taking Northeast China as an example, in order to prevent Northeast China from falling into the hands of the Chinese people and turning this place into an American military base, American imperialism used large-scale sea and air transport to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's army attack Northeast China and North China, and in many ways slandered the friendly relations between the Chinese and Soviet people. After the victory of the Chinese people, the American reactionaries became even more hostile to the new China, and even blatantly, while invading Korea, armedly invaded our Taiwan and strafed our Northeast border. All of this is repeating the old path of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. American imperialism is also conspiring to organize the so-called "Pacific Alliance," which is also a replica of the Japanese imperialism's "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
    In Japan, American imperialism's actions in exclusively occupying Japan for the past five years since Japan's surrender are also notorious. According to the common agreement of the Allied countries, the purpose of occupying and controlling Japan was originally to transform militaristic Japan into a peaceful Japan and eradicate the root of aggression in the East; however, American imperialism rearmed Japan, making Japan a military base for launching new wars of aggression. The original purpose of controlling Japan was to transform fascist Japan into a democratic and free Japan; however, American imperialism established a new fascist rule colluding with the American-Japanese reactionary groups, released Japanese war criminals since September 18th, condoned and appointed notorious aggressors in Japan since September 18th, persecuted the Japanese Communist Party, which is a democratic fortress, persecuted Japanese progressive organizations and progressive people who are fighting for democracy and freedom, and reduced Japan to its colony and enslaved the Japanese nation. The original purpose of controlling Japan was to lift the exploitation of the Japanese people by blood-sucking Japanese financial groups and landlords and improve the lives of the Japanese people; however, American imperialism colluded with Japanese large financial groups and squeezed Japan as a colony, causing the Japanese people to live a miserable life. American imperialism not only violated international agreements and delayed and obstructed a genuine peace treaty with Japan, but also tried to unilaterally conclude a peace treaty with Japan. This American plot for a unilateral peace treaty with Japan is now being accelerated. President Truman's statement on September 14 regarding the peace treaty with Japan indicated this point. In this statement, Truman said that he "has authorized the State Department to begin informal discussions on future procedures, first with the governments represented on the Far Eastern Commission, that is, with the governments that have the most active relationship with the Pacific War." Truman's statement fundamentally violates the Potsdam Declaration. Because according the principles stipulated by the Potsdam Declaration, the peace treaty with Japan should be prepared by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, China, Britain and the United States, not by the Far Eastern Commission. The reason why American imperialism blatantly disregards the principles of the Potsdam Declaration and insists on preparing the peace treaty with Japan by the Far Eastern Commission is precisely to use its majority in the Far Eastern Commission to openly implement its conspiracy to turn Japan into an American base of aggression.
    After the start of the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism has more blatantly turned Japan, a military base, into a war base for officially carrying out aggression. On top of this war base, American imperialism has also established a new wartime system in Japan in political, economic and other aspects to meet its needs in engaging in wars of aggression. Fascist terror rule has deepened, military production has expanded, and arming Japan has become more active. Now Japan is the headquarters of American imperialism directing the war of aggression against Korea, the base of operations for dispatching troops and transporting munitions and military supplies, the arsenal for manufacturing munitions and military supplies, and the warehouse for searching for manpower and material resources.
    American imperialism has replaced Japanese imperialism and become the great enemy of the people of the East. However, although today's American imperialism is more brutal and ferocious than the past Japanese imperialism, the difficulties it encounters are also more profound than those of Japanese imperialism. The forces in the world defending peace are now much stronger than ever before, and the awareness of the people of the world, including the American people, who are demanding peace, has increased several times more than in the past. American imperialism, which is strong in appearance but weak in reality, has replaced Japanese imperialism in carrying out aggression, and it will inevitably follow in the footsteps of Japanese imperialism and suffer a more rapid and thorough demise.
    China is no longer the China of the September 18th era. The Chinese people will never allow American imperialism to be as rampant as Japanese imperialism was. The Chinese people had the strength to defeat Japanese imperialism during the Anti-Japanese War, and the strength to drive out American imperialism during the Liberation War, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army it armed on the mainland. In the future, under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people will be united and will inevitably have more strength to deal with new aggression from American imperialism.
    The Korean people have demonstrated great strength in the war against American imperialism's aggression. The Korean people are now standing on the front line of the war against aggression, and the people of all Asian countries should resolutely support the Korean people. Although the future struggle in Korea has tended towards a difficult and protracted situation, the Chinese experience proves that as long as we unite and persevere, the Korean people and the Asian people will be able to achieve the final victory in the struggle against American imperialism, no matter what difficulties and setbacks they go through.
    The Japanese people are no longer as docile as they used to be. They are united around the Japanese Communist Party and are forming a strong national democratic united front to fight against American imperialism. American imperialism cannot be stable in Japan, this base. American imperialism's attempt to deceive the Japanese people with the guise of a peace treaty and establish its rule in Japan is bound to fail.
    The people of Vietnam, the Philippines, and other countries in Southeast Asia are also fighting against imperialism or domestic reactionary forces. They will also have the strength to cope with American imperialism's aggression.
    People of the entire East, unite, shatter the conspiracy of American imperialism to expand the war of aggression, drive out American imperialism, and defend peace in Asia and the world!

### 反对今天远东的侵略者——美国帝国主义！——纪念“九一八”十九周年

　　反对今天远东的侵略者——美国帝国主义！
    ——纪念“九一八”十九周年
    今天，我们是在中国人民革命取得伟大胜利，世界各国争取和平反对战争的人民运动蓬勃发展的形势下，来纪念九一八的十九周年。同时，我们是在美国帝国主义残暴侵略朝鲜、侵略我国领土台湾、并进一步威胁东南亚各民族的情况下，来纪念“九一八”的十九周年。
    美国帝国主义，这个在反法西斯的第二次世界大战中投机取巧、以较小损失窃得很大一部分胜利果实的帝国主义，今天在东方已经完全代替了日本帝国主义，且比过去的日本帝国主义还要残暴，还要凶恶。
    美国帝国主义不仅在现在代替日本帝国主义成为侵略者，在过去长期间也支持和鼓励日本帝国主义的侵略。一九三一年九月十八日，日本帝国主义在我国东北发动武装侵略以后，美国帝国主义急于要使日本帝国主义充当远东反苏反共反人民的宪兵，所以一面在形式上采取了空洞的“不承认主义”，一面在实际上仍然鼓励日本侵略势力的发展。直至一九四一年十二月八日，日美战争爆发以前，日本用于侵略战争的军火和军需物资，很多是美国供给的；日本在我东北建立大规模的军事生产体制和军事基地，在物质上和技术上，也都得到了美国的积极协助。而自一九三七年七月七日日本帝国主义发动对中国的全面侵略以后，美国帝国主义还是继续以大量军事工业装备和军需原料如汽油和废铁等输入日本，从而增大了日本的侵略力量。美帝国主义者当时积极帮助日本侵略者的目的，就是想利用日本充当远东反革命的先锋，并且求得两个帝国主义的妥协。但出乎美国帝国主义意料之外的是：日本侵略者竟发动了珍珠港事变，对美国采取了直接的进攻行动，这样才爆发了美日战争。由于日本在第二次世界大战中的失败，美帝国主义就代替日本成为亚洲的新侵略者，并且完全控制了日本，使日本的反动派完全为美国利益服务。
    在日本投降以后，美帝国主义在远东一方面积极扶植日本法西斯势力复活，阴谋将日本变作美国在远东实行新侵略的工具；一方面帮助蒋介石匪帮发动大规模内战，屠杀中国人民。美国在日本和中国实行这种反动政策的共同目的，就是为了把日本和中国变作它的殖民地和战争基地。但由于中国人民革命的胜利，美帝国主义的这一罪恶计划遭到了失败。就以东北来说，美帝国主义为了阻挠东北归入中国人民之手，把这块地方变作美国的军事基地，美帝国主义曾经以大规模的海空运输，帮助蒋介石匪帮的军队进攻东北和华北，并多方诬蔑中苏两国人民间的友好关系。中国人民胜利之后，美国反动派对于新中国更为敌视，甚至悍然于侵略朝鲜的同时，武装侵略我台湾，扫射我东北边疆，这一切都在重复着日本帝国主义侵略中国的老路。美帝国主义并且阴谋组织所谓“太平洋联盟”，而这也正是日本帝国主义“大东亚共荣圈”的翻版。
    在日本，美帝国主义于日本投降后，五年来独占日本的所作所为，也是罪行昭著。按照同盟各国的共同协议，占领和管制日本的目的，原来是要把黩武的日本，转变为和平的日本，拔除东方侵略的根源；但是，美国帝国主义却重新武装日本，使日本成为发动新的侵略战争的军事基地。管制日本原来是要把法西斯的日本，转变为民主、自由的日本；但是，美国帝国主义却建立了由美日反动集团所合串的新的法西斯统治，释放九一八以来的日本战犯，纵容和任用九一八以来的日本的彰明较著的侵略分子，迫害民主堡垒的日本共产党，迫害争民主、争自由的日本进步团体和进步人士，并沦日本为其殖民地，奴役日本民族。管制日本原来是要解除吸血的日本财阀和地主对日本人民的压榨，改善日本人民的生活；但是，美国帝国主义却勾结着日本大财阀，把日本当作了殖民地来榨取，使日本人民过着悲惨的生活。美帝国主义不但违反了国际协定，拖延与阻挠真正的对日和约，而且还力图片面对日媾和。美国这一对日片面媾和的阴谋现正加紧进行中。美国总统杜鲁门九月十四日关于对日和约的声明即表明了这一点。杜鲁门在这个声明中说他“已授权国务院开始举行关于未来程序的非正式讨论，首先要和有代表参加远东委员会的政府，也就是与太平洋战争有最积极的关系的政府举行讨论。”杜鲁门的这一声明是根本违反波茨坦宣言的。因为按照波茨坦宣言规定的原则，对日和约应由苏中英美四国外长会议负责准备，而不应由远东委员会准备。美帝国主义所以悍然不顾波茨坦宣言的原则而硬要由远东委员会准备对日和约，正是为了利用其在远东委员会上的多数以公开实行其变日本为美国侵略基地的阴谋计划。
    对朝鲜的侵略战争开始后，美国帝国主义更明目张胆，把军事基地的日本，进而变成为正式进行侵略的战争基地。在这个战争基地之上，美国帝国主义又在政治、经济等各方面，建立了日本新的战时体制，以适应其从事侵略战争的需要。法西斯恐怖统治更深化，军事生产更扩大，武装日本更积极。现在日本是美国帝国主义指挥对朝鲜侵略战争的总司令部所在地，调遣军队、输送军火、军需品的兵站，制造军火、军用物资的兵工厂，搜索人力、物力的库房。
    美国帝国主义代替了日本帝国主义，成为东方人民的大敌。可是，今天美国帝国主义虽然比过去日本帝国主义还要残暴，还要凶恶，但它所遭遇着的困难，也比日本帝国主义还要深重。全世界保卫和平的力量已经比过去任何时候都强大得多，全世界人民包括美国人民在内，要求和平的觉悟性，比过去任何时候也增大了好几倍。外强中干的美国帝国主义，它代替了日本帝国主义从事侵略，它一定也要步上日本帝国主义的后尘而遭到更迅速更彻底的覆灭。
    中国已经不是九一八时代的中国了。中国人民决不让美国帝国主义再像日本帝国主义一样的猖獗。中国人民在对日抗战时期有力量击败日本帝国主义，解放战争时期有力量驱逐美国帝国主义，在大陆上消灭它所武装的蒋介石匪军，今后在中央人民政府和中国共产党领导之下，中国人民团结一致，必然更有力量对付美国帝国主义新的侵略。
    朝鲜人民已在反抗美国帝国主义侵略的战争中，表现着伟大的力量，朝鲜人民现在是站在反侵略战争的第一线，亚洲各国人民都应当坚决声援朝鲜人民。朝鲜今后的斗争虽然已趋于艰苦的持久局面，但是中国的经验证明，只要团结一致，坚持不懈，朝鲜人民和亚洲人民在反对美国帝国主义的斗争中，无论经过什么艰难曲折，必能取得最后的胜利。
    日本人民也已经不再像过去那末驯服了，他们团结在日本共产党的周围，组成着强大的民族民主统一战线，对美国帝国主义作斗争。美国帝国主义在日本这个基地，是不能安稳的。美国帝国主义企图拿和约的幌子，来欺骗日本人民，确立其在日本的统治地位，它的阴谋是一定要失败的。
    越南、菲律宾人民及东南亚其他各国人民，目前也正在跟帝国主义或国内反动势力作斗争，他们一定也会有力量应付美国帝国主义的侵略。
    全东方人民团结起来，粉碎美国帝国主义扩大侵略战争的阴谋，驱逐美国帝国主义，保卫亚洲和世界的和平！
