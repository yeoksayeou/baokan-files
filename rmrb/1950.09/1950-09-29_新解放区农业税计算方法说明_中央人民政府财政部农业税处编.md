Explanation of Agricultural Tax Calculation Methods in Newly Liberated Areas
Compiled by the Agricultural Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government

The Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas were approved and promulgated on September 5th by the Ninth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee. To facilitate calculation in various regions, the Agricultural Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government has compiled this explanation for reference.

Part 1: Calculation Method for General Farmers:

A. Explanation and Formulas for General Calculation Methods:

I. Calculation Method:

1.  Convert the total agricultural income of the whole family according to its different nature. That is, income from self-cultivated land is calculated as 100 catties for every 100 catties; income from rented-out land is calculated as 120 catties for every 100 catties; income from tenant-cultivated land (the remaining portion of the tenant-cultivated land's normal yield after deducting taxes) is calculated as 80 catties for every 100 catties. Add the three items to get the total converted income of the whole family.

2.  Divide the total converted income by the agricultural population of the whole family to get the average converted income per person.

3.  Refer to the tax rate table with the average converted income per person to find the tax rate to be borne. Then multiply the total converted income of the whole family by the tax rate found to get the total amount of regular tax payable by the whole family.

4.  Multiply the total amount of regular tax payable by the whole family by 15% to get the local surcharge on agricultural tax.

5.  Add the total amount of regular tax payable by the whole family and the local surcharge on agricultural tax to get the total amount of agricultural tax payable by the whole family for the whole year.

II. Calculation Formula: The above calculation steps are summarized as follows:

1.  Income from self-cultivated land + Income from rented-out land × 120% + Income from tenant-cultivated land × 80% = Total converted income of the whole family.

2.  Total converted income of the whole family ÷ Agricultural population of the whole family = Average converted income per person.

3.  Total converted income of the whole family × Tax rate = Total amount of regular tax payable by the whole family.

4.  Total amount of regular tax payable by the whole family × 15% = Local surcharge on agricultural tax for the whole family.

5.  Total amount of regular tax payable by the whole family + Local surcharge on agricultural tax for the whole family = Total amount of agricultural tax payable by the whole family for the whole year.

B. Example:

Li Si's family has four agricultural members, 10 mu of self-cultivated land with a normal yield of 3,000 catties of rice, 3 mu of tenant-cultivated land with a normal yield of 900 catties, and an income of 630 catties of rice after paying 270 catties as rent. He also rents out 10 mu of land, receiving 1,000 catties of rice in rent. The calculation method for the public grain burden of this household is as follows:

1.  Li Si's total converted income = 3,000 catties + 630 catties × 80% + 1,000 catties × 120% = 4,704 catties of rice.

2.  Average converted income per person = 4,704 catties ÷ 4 = 1,176 catties of rice.

3.  With an average of 1,176 catties of rice per person, the tax rate table shows the 20th level, with a tax rate of 22%. The total amount of regular tax payable by the whole family = 4,704 catties of rice × 22% = 1,034.88 catties of rice.

4.  Local surcharge on agricultural tax for the whole family = 1,034.88 catties of rice × 15% = 155.23 catties of rice.

5.  Total agricultural tax payable by Li Si's family = 1,034.88 catties of rice + 155.23 catties of rice = 1,190.11 catties of rice.

Part 2: Calculation Methods for Several Special Circumstances:

A. Calculation Method Formula and Example for Land Without Rent Reduction According to Law:

I. Calculation Method:

1.  For landlords who have not reduced rent according to law, calculate the household's tax payable based on rental income (referring to income before rent reduction, including self-cultivated and tenant-cultivated income if any) according to the general calculation procedure (see Part 1).

2.  Multiply the tenant's income (the remaining part of the normal yield of tenant-cultivated land after deducting the rent amount) by 9% to get the regular tax payable by the landlord on behalf of the tenant. Multiply the regular tax amount by 15% to get the local surcharge on agricultural tax payable on behalf of the tenant. The sum of the two is the amount of tax to be paid on behalf of the tenant.

3.  Add the landlord's tax payable and the tax payable on behalf of the tenant to get the total agricultural tax payable by the entire family of the landlord who has not reduced rent according to law.

4.  When rent is reduced after the landlord pays taxes, the portion of the tax paid on behalf of the tenant should be deducted from the refundable rent amount.

II. Summarize the calculation formula according to the above steps as follows:

1.  The calculation formula for the landlord's income portion (income before rent reduction) is the same as the general household calculation formula.

2.  Calculation formula for the tax payable by the landlord on behalf of the tenant:

    (1) Tenant income (normal yield - rent amount) × 9% = Regular tax payable on behalf of the tenant.

    (2) Regular tax payable on behalf of the tenant × 15% = Local surcharge on agricultural tax payable on behalf of the tenant.

    (3) Regular tax payable on behalf of the tenant + Local surcharge on agricultural tax payable on behalf of the tenant = Tax to be paid on behalf of the tenant.

3.  Tax payable on the landlord's income portion + Tax to be paid on behalf of the tenant = Total agricultural tax payable by the landlord for the whole year.

4.  Rent refundable to the landlord - Tax to be paid on behalf of the tenant = Actual rent refunded to the landlord.

III. Example:

Zhang San's family has two agricultural members, rents out 10 mu of land (normal yield of 4,000 catties), and receives 1,600 catties of rice in rent. He also has 5 mu of self-cultivated land with a normal yield of 2,000 catties of rice. The calculation of the household's burden is as follows:

1.  The calculation of Zhang San's rental income portion is as follows:

    (1) Zhang San's total converted income = 1,600 catties of rice × 120% + 2,000 catties of rice = 3,920 catties of rice.

    (2) Average converted income per person = 3,920 catties of rice ÷ 2 = 1,960 catties of rice.

    (3) With an average of 1,960 catties of rice per person, the tax rate table shows the 28th level, with a tax rate of 30%.

    Zhang San's regular tax payable on the rental income portion = 3,920 catties of rice × 30% = 1,176 catties of rice.

    (4) Local surcharge on agricultural tax = 1,176 catties of rice × 15% = 176.4 catties of rice.

    (5) Zhang San's tax payable on the rental income portion for the whole year = 1,176 catties of rice + 176.4 catties of rice = 1,352.4 catties of rice.

2.  Calculation of the portion Zhang San should pay on behalf of the tenant:

    (1) Regular tax payable on behalf of the tenant = 2,400 catties of rice × 9% = 216 catties of rice.

    (2) Local surcharge on agricultural tax payable on behalf of the tenant = 216 catties of rice × 15% = 32.4 catties of rice.

    (3) Tax to be paid on behalf of the tenant = 216 catties of rice + 32.4 catties of rice = 248.4 catties of rice.

3.  Zhang San's total tax payable for the whole year = 1,352.4 catties of rice + 248.4 catties of rice = 1,600.8 catties of rice.

4.  Calculation of the actual rent returned when Zhang San reduces rent after paying taxes:

    1,600 catties × 25% - 248.4 catties = 1516 catties of rice

B. Calculation Method Formula and Example for Land Where the Landlord Does Not Collect Rent:

I. Calculation Method:

1.  According to the normal yield of the land, in proportion to the original rent amount, and in accordance with the provisions of the rent reduction decree (reducing the original rent amount by 25%. If the rent amount after the 25% reduction is still higher than 37.5% of the land's regular produce, it should be reduced to 37.5%), divide the landlord's income portion and the tenant's income portion.

2.  Calculate the tenant's income portion according to the tenant-cultivated income calculation (i.e., calculating 100 catties as 80 catties). According to the general calculation procedure (see Part 1), find the regular tax payable by the tenant (the tenant's other agricultural income should be combined for calculation). Multiply the regular tax payable by 15% to get the local surcharge on agricultural tax payable. The sum of the two is the agricultural tax payable on the tenant's income portion.

3.  After converting the landlord's income portion at 100 catties to 120 catties, multiply it by the applicable tax rate (this tax rate is calculated by converting all of the landlord's agricultural income in the township, according to the different nature of rented-out, tenant-cultivated, and self-cultivated land, to get the landlord's total converted income. Divide it by the landlord's agricultural population in the township to get the average converted income per person. Then use the average income per person to look up the applicable tax rate in the tax rate table). This yields the regular tax amount that the tenant should pay on behalf of the landlord. Then multiply it by 15% to get the local surcharge on agricultural tax that the tenant should pay on behalf of the landlord. The sum of the two is the agricultural tax amount that the tenant should pay on behalf of the landlord (the landlord's population is calculated as follows: for landlords residing in the township, the actual agricultural population of the whole household should be calculated. For those in other townships, the specific regulations of the provincial (municipal) people's government should be followed, but for land in other provinces, count as one person per household).

4.  The agricultural tax payable on the tenant's income portion plus the agricultural tax that the tenant pays on behalf of the landlord is the total agricultural tax payable by the tenant for the whole year (after the tenant pays taxes, when implementing rent payment, the amount of tax paid on behalf of the landlord can be deducted from the rent payable).

II. Calculation Formula:

1.  Division of the landlord's income and the tenant's income:

    (1) Landlord's income portion = Original rent amount × (1 - 25%) (After reducing the original rent amount by 25%, if it still exceeds 37.5% of the regular produce, it should be reduced to 37.5%).

    (2) Tenant's income portion = Normal yield - Landlord's income portion.

2.  The tax payable on the tenant's income portion is calculated sequentially according to the general calculation formula.

The tax payable on the landlord's income portion that the tenant pays on behalf of the landlord = Landlord's income portion × 120% × Applicable tax rate (see item 3 of the above calculation method).

3.  Tenant's tax payable + Tax paid by the tenant on behalf of the landlord = Total agricultural tax payable by the tenant for the whole year.

4.  Rent payable by the tenant - Tax paid on behalf of the landlord = Actual rent paid by the tenant.

Note: Rent reduction methods vary from province to province. The above explanation and formula are proposed based on the 25% rent reduction method. When implementing in various provinces, the regulations of each province should be followed.

III. Example:

Wang San's family has four agricultural members and rents 10 mu of land from Li Si (normal yield of 4,000 catties), with an original rent amount of 1,600 catties. Li Si's family has two agricultural members and 40 mu of land, 10 mu of which is self-cultivated, and 30 mu of which is rented out. Besides renting 10 mu to Wang San, the remaining 20 mu (normal yield of 8,000 catties) are rented to two other tenants, who should pay a total rent of 3,200 catties. The normal yield per mu of this land is 400 catties. Besides tenant-cultivating 10 mu, Wang San also has 2 mu of self-cultivated land with a normal yield of 800 catties. The calculation of Wang San's tax payable is as follows:

1.  Division of Wang San's income and Li Si's income

    (1) Li Si's income = 1,600 catties × (1 - 25%) = 1,200 catties.

    (2) Wang San's income = 4,000 catties - 1,200 catties = 2,800 catties.

2.  Calculation of the tax paid by Wang San on behalf of landlord Li Si:

    (1) Li Si's total converted income = 4,000 catties (self-cultivated income) + 1,200 catties × 3 × 120% (rental income) = 8,320 catties.

    (2) Li Si's average converted income per person = 8,320 catties ÷ 2 = 4,160 catties.

    (3) Looking up the tax rate table with the average converted income per person, the applicable tax rate is 42%.

    (4) Regular tax payable by Wang San on behalf of Li Si = (1,200 catties × 120%) × 42% = 604.8 catties;

    Local surcharge on agricultural tax payable on behalf of Li Si = 604.8 catties × 15% = 90.72 catties.

    (5) Tax payable by Wang San on behalf of Li Si = 604.8 catties + 90.72 catties = 695.52 catties.

3.  Calculation of Wang San's tax payable:

    (1) Wang San's total converted income = 2,800 catties × 80% + 800 catties = 3,040 catties.

    (2) Average converted income per person = 3,040 catties ÷ 4 = 760 catties. Looking up the tax rate table for 760 catties, it is the 14th level, with a tax rate of 16%.

    (3) Regular tax payable by Wang San's family = 3,040 catties × 16% = 486 catties; Local surcharge on agricultural tax payable = 486.4 catties × 15% = 72.96 catties.

    (4) Tax payable by Wang San's family = 486.4 catties + 72.96 catties = 559.36 catties.

4.  Wang San's total tax payable = 695.52 catties + 559.36 catties = 1254.88 catties.

5.  After Wang San pays taxes, the calculation of the rent payment during rent payment is as follows:

    1,200 catties - 695.52 catties = 504.48 catties.

C. Calculation Method Formula and Example for Special Households with an Annual Income of 200,000 Catties or More:

I. For special households with an annual income of 200,000 catties or more, the maximum tax rate shall not exceed 80%, including the local surcharge on agricultural tax. If the household has not yet reduced rent, the tax paid on behalf of the tenant is also included within the 80%.

II. Calculation Formula (calculated at the highest tax rate) is as follows:

Total income × 80% = Total tax payable by the household;

If the special household has not yet reduced rent, when implementing rent refund after paying taxes, the portion of the tax paid on behalf of the tenant must be deducted from the rent refund amount.

III. Example:

Li Er rents out 1,000 mu of land with a normal yield of 400,000 catties, renting it out on a 50/50 split, receiving 200,000 catties in rent. The calculation of the tax payable is as follows:

Total tax payable by the household = 200,000 catties × 80% = 160,000 catties.

This 160,000 catties includes the tax paid on behalf of the tenant as follows:

Regular tax paid on behalf of the tenant = 200,000 catties × 9% = 18,000 catties;

Local surcharge on agricultural tax paid on behalf of the tenant = 18,000 catties × 15% = 2,700 catties;

Total tax paid on behalf of the tenant = 18,000 catties + 2,700 catties = 20,700 catties.

Rent reduction amount after paying taxes = 200,000 catties × 25% = 50,000 catties;

Actual rent refunded after deducting the tax paid on behalf of the tenant = 50,000 catties - 20,700 catties = 29,300 catties.

D. For agricultural income that cannot be calculated on a per capita basis, the calculation method is as follows:

1.  The calculation method for the land income of schools, orphanages, nursing homes, and hospitals is as follows:

    (1) Self-operated land: Regular tax payable = Annual agricultural income × 7%.

    (2) Rented-out land: Regular tax payable = Annual rental income × 10%.

2.  The calculation method for the burden of state-owned farms is as follows:

    Regular tax payable = Annual agricultural income × 10%.

3.  The calculation method for the burden of ancestral halls, societies, temples, and churches is as follows:

    (1) Self-cultivated land: Regular tax payable = Annual agricultural income × 14%.

    (2) Operated by hired labor: Regular tax payable = Annual agricultural income × 25%.

    (3) Rented-out land: Regular tax payable = Annual rental income × 40%.

The above regular tax amounts must also be added to the local surcharge on agricultural tax, which is 15% of the regular tax amount.

Appendix:

　　新解放区农业税计算方法说明
    中央人民政府财政部农业税处编
    新解放区农业税暂行条例已于九月五日经中央人民政府委员会第九次会议批准公布施行。为便于各地计算起见，中央人民政府财政部农业税处又编此说明，以供各地参考。
  第一部分：一般农户的计算方法：
    甲、一般计算方法的说明和公式：
    一、计算方法：
    １、将全家农业收入，按不同性质，分别加以折合，即自耕地收入每一百市斤仍作一百市斤计算，出租地收入每一百市斤作一百二十市斤计算，佃耕地收入（佃耕地的常年产量除去税额后的剩科部分）每一百市斤作八十市斤计算，三项相加得出全家总的折合收入。
    ２、以全家农业人口，除总折合收入，得出每人平均折合收入。
    ３、拿每人平均折合收入去查税率表中的应负担税率，然后用查出的税率去乘全家的总折合收入，即得出全家应纳正税额。
    ４、全家应纳正税额乘百分之十五，得出农业税地方附加额。
    ５、全家应纳正税额加农业税地方附加额，得出全家全年应纳农业税总额。
    二、计算公式：依上述计算步骤归纳如下：
    １、自耕地收入＋出租地收入×１２０％＋佃耕地收入×８０％＝全家总折合收入。
    ２、全家总折合收入÷全家农业人口＝每人平均折合收入。
    ３、全家总折合收入×税率＝全家应纳正税额。
    ４、全家应纳正税额×１５％＝全家农业税地方附加额。
    ５、全家应纳正税额＋全家农业税地方附加额＝全家全年应纳农业税总额。
    乙、举例：
    李四全家农业人口四人，自耕地十亩，常年应产量三千市斤稻谷，佃耕地三亩，常年应产量九百市斤，除交租二百七十市斤外，收入六百三十市斤稻谷，出租地十亩，收租一千市斤稻谷，该户负担公粮计算方式如下：
    １、李四全家总折合收入＝３，０００市斤＋６３０市斤×８０％＋１，０００市斤×１２０％＝４，７０４市斤稻谷。
    ２、每人平均折合收入＝４，７０４市斤÷４＝１，１７６市斤稻谷。
    ３、每人平均１，１７６市斤稻谷，查税率表为第二十级，税率为２２％，全家应纳正税额＝４，７０４市斤稻谷×２２％＝１，０３４．８８市斤稻谷。
    ４、全家农业税地方附加额＝１，０３４．８８市斤稻谷×１５％＝１５５．２３市斤稻谷。
    ５、李四全家应纳农业税总额＝１，０３４．８８市斤稻谷＋１５５．２３市斤稻谷＝１，１９０．１１市斤稻谷。
  第二部分：几种特殊情形的计算方法：
    甲、未依法减租的土地，其农业税的计算方法公式及举例：
    一、计算方法：
    １、未依法减租的业主，按出租收入（指减租前的收入，如有自耕和佃耕收入应合并计算）依一般计算程序（见第一部分）求出本户应纳税额。
    ２、佃户收入（佃耕地的常年应产量除去租额后的剩余部分）乘百分之九，得出业主代佃户应纳正税额，正税额再乘１５％得出代佃户应纳农业税地方附加额，二者相加，就是应代佃户交税额。
    ３、业主应纳税额加应代佃户交纳税额，就是未依法减租的业主全家应纳农业税额。
    ４、业主交税后，进行减租时，在应退租额中将代佃户交纳税额部分扣除。
    二、依上述步骤归纳计算公式如下：
    １、业主收入部分（减租前的收入）计算公式与一般户计算公式同。
    ２、业主应代佃户交纳税额的计算公式：
    （一）佃户收入（常年应产量—租额）×９％＝代佃户应纳正税额。
    （二）代佃户应纳正税额×１５％＝代佃户应纳农业税地方附加额。
    （三）代佃户应纳正税额＋代佃户应纳农业税地方附加额＝应代佃户交纳税额。
    ３、业主收入部分应纳税额＋应代佃户交纳税额＝业主全年应纳农业税额。
    ４、业主应退租额—应代佃户交纳税额＝业主实退租额。
    三、举例：
    张三全家农业人口二人，出租地十亩（常年应产量四千斤），共收租一千六百市斤稻谷，另有自耕地五亩，常年应产量二千市斤稻谷，该户负担计算如下：
    １、张三出租收入部分，负担计算如下：
    （一）张三全家总折合收入＝１，６００市斤稻谷×１２０％＋２，０００市斤稻谷＝３，９２０市斤稻谷。
    （二）每人平均折合收入＝３，９２０市斤稻谷÷２＝１，９６０市斤稻谷。
    （三）每人平均１，９６０市斤稻谷，查税率表为第２８级，税率为３０％。
    张三全家出租收入部分应纳正税额＝３，９２０市斤稻谷×３０％＝１，１７６市斤稻谷。
    （四）农业税地方附加额＝１，１７６市斤稻谷×１５％＝１７６．４市斤稻谷。
    （五）张三全年出租收入部分应纳税额＝１，１７６市斤稻谷＋１７６．４市斤稻谷＝１，３５２．４市斤稻谷。
    ２、张三应代佃户交纳部分计算如下：
    （一）应代佃户交纳正税额＝２，４００市斤稻谷×９％＝２１６市斤稻谷。
    （二）应代佃户交纳农业税地方附加额＝２１６市斤稻谷×１５％＝３２．４市斤稻谷。
    （三）应代佃户交纳税额＝２１６市斤稻谷＋３２．４市斤稻谷＝２４８．４市斤稻谷。
    ３、张三全年应纳税总额＝１．３５２．４市斤稻谷＋２４８．４市斤稻谷＝１，６００．８市斤稻谷。
    ４、张三交税后进行减租时其实退租额计算如下：
    １，６００市斤×２５％—２４８．４市斤＝１５１６市斤稻谷，
    乙、业主不收租的土地，其负担计算方法公式及举例：
    一、计算方法：
    １、根据土地的常年应产量，按原种额比例，依减租法令的规定（按原租额减去２５％，如减２５％之后的租额仍高于土地正产物的３７．５％者，应减至３７．５％），划分业主应收入部分及佃户应收入部分。
    ２、佃户应收入部分，依佃耕收入计算（即１００斤作８０斤计算），按一般计算程序（见第一部分）求出其应纳正税额（佃户如有其他农业收入应合并计算），应纳正税额乘百分之十五，即得出应纳农业税地方附加额，二者相加即佃户收入部分的应纳农业税额。
    ３、业主收入部分按１００斤作１２０斤折合后，乘以应得税率（此税率是将业主在本乡的全部农业收入，按出租佃耕及自耕的不同性质分别折算后，得出业主总折合收入，以业主在本乡的农业人口去除，得每人平均折合收入，再以每人折合收入按税率表查出应得的税率），得出佃户应代业主交纳的正税额，再乘百分之十五，即得出佃户代业主交纳的农业税地方附加额，二者相加即为佃户代业主交纳的农业税额（业主之人口计算如下：凡业主住在本乡者，应按全户实有农业人口计算，在外乡者，应根据该省（市）人民政府具体规定执行，但在外省之土地按一户一人计）。
    ４、佃户应收入部分的应纳农业税额加佃户代业主交纳的农业税额，即为佃户全年应纳农业税额（佃户交税后，实行交租时，得由应交租中将代业主交纳税额扣除之）。
    二、计算公式：
    １、业主应收入及佃户应收入的划分：
    （一）业主应收入部分＝原租额×（１—２５％）（原租额减去２５％后，如仍超过正产物的３７．５％者，应减至３７．５％）。
    （二）佃户应收入部分＝常年应产量—业主应收入部分。
    ２、佃户应收入部分的应纳税额按一般计算公式依次计算之。
    佃户代业主收入部分的应纳税额＝业主应收入部分×１２０％×应得税率（见上述计算方法第３项）。
    ３、佃户应纳税额＋佃户代业主交纳税额＝佃户全年应纳税总额。
    ４、佃户应交租额—代业主交纳税额＝佃户实交租额。
    注：各省减租办法不尽一致，上列说明和公式是按二五减租办法提出的。各省执行时，应以各该省规定为准。
    三、举例：
    王三全家农业人口四人，租得李四地十亩，（常年产量四千斤）原租额１，６００市斤，李四全家农业人口二人，地四十亩，自耕十亩，出租三十亩，除十亩租给王三外，其余二十亩（常年产量八千斤）分租给其他二佃户，二户共应交租额３，２００市斤，该地每亩常年应产量均为４００市斤，王三除佃耕十亩外，另有自耕地二亩，常年应产量共为８００市斤，李四今年不收租，王三的应纳税额计算如下：
    １、王三收入与李四应收入之划分（一）李四应收入＝１，６００市斤×（１—２５％）＝１，２００市斤。
    （二）王三应收入＝４，０００市斤—１，２００市斤＝２，８００市斤。
    ２、王三代业主李四交纳税额计算如下：
    （一）李四总折合收入＝４，０００市斤（自耕收入）＋１，２００市斤×３×１２０％（出租收入）＝８，３２０市斤。
    （二）李四每人平均折合收入＝８，３２０市斤÷２＝４，１６０市斤。
    （三）按每人平均折合收入去查税率表，应负担税率为４２％。
    （四）王三代李四应纳正税额＝（１，２００市斤×１２０％）×４２％＝６０４．８市斤；
    代李四应纳农业税地方附加额＝６０４．８市斤×１５％＝９０．７２市斤。
    （五）王三代李四应纳税额＝６０４．８市斤＋９０．７２市斤＝６９５．５２市斤。
    ３、王三应纳税额计算如下：
    （一）王三全家总折合收入＝２．８００市斤×８０％＋８００市斤＝３．０４０市斤。
    （二）每人平均折合收入＝３．０４０市斤÷４＝７６０市斤。７６０市斤查税率表为第十四章，税率为１６％。
    （三）王三全家应纳正税额＝３．０４０市斤×１６％＝４８６市斤；应纳农业税地方附加额＝４８６．４市斤×１５％＝７２．９６市斤。
    （四）王三全家应纳税额＝４８６．４市斤＋７２．９６市斤＝５５９．３６市斤。
    ４、王三应纳税总额＝６９５．５２市斤＋５５９．３６市斤＝１２５４．８８市斤。
    ５、王三交税后，实行缴租时，其交租部分计算如下：
    １，２００市斤—６９５．５２市斤＝５０４．４８市斤。
    丙、特殊户全年收入２０万市斤以上者，其负担计算方法公式及举例：
    一、特殊户全年收入２０万市斤以上者，其税率最高不得超过８０％，包括农业税地方附加额，如该户尚未减租，则其代佃户交纳税额亦包括在８０％之内。
    二、计算公式（以最高税率计）如下：
    总收入×８０％＝全户应纳税额；
    特殊户如果还没有减租，在交税后进行退租时，得在应退租额中，扣除其代佃户所交纳税额部分。
    三、举例：
    李二出租地一千亩，常年应产量４０万斤，对半分租，共收租２０万市斤，其应纳税额计算如下：
    全户应纳税额＝２００，０００市斤×８０％＝１６０，０００市斤。
    此１６０，０００市斤，包括代佃户交纳税额如下：
    代佃户交纳正税额＝２００，０００市斤×９％＝１８，０００市斤；
    代佃户交纳农业税地方附加额＝１８，０００市斤×１５％＝２，７００市斤；
    共计代佃户交纳税额＝１８，０００市斤＋２，７００市斤＝２０，７００市斤。
    交税后减租时应减租额＝２００，０００市斤×２５％＝５０，０００市斤；
    扣除代佃户交纳税额后，实退租额＝５０，０００市斤—２０，７００市斤＝２９，３００市斤。
    丁、凡农业收入不能按人口平均计算者，其计算方法如下：
    １、学校、孤儿院、养老院、医院的土地收入，其计算方法如下：
    （一）自营土地：应纳正税额＝全年农业收入×７％。
    （二）出租土地：应纳正税额＝全年出租收入×１０％。
    ２、公营农场负担计算方法如下：
    应纳正税额＝全年农业收入×１０％。
    ３、祠堂、会社、寺庙、教会的土地，其负担计算方法如下：
    （一）自耕土地：应纳正税额＝全年农业收入×１４％。
    （二）雇工经营者：应纳正税额＝全年农业收入×２５％。
    （三）出租土地：应纳正税额＝全年出租收入×４０％。
    以上正税额均须再加占正税额百分之十五的农业税地方附加额。
