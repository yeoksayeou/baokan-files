Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, September 2nd: The news that U.S. invading Korean troops' planes twice intruded into our Northeast airspace, killing and wounding our compatriots, has brought the anger of the 107 heroes and model workers at the Heroes and Model Workers Congress of the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Shaanxi and the Shaanxi Military Region to a boiling point. These heroes, who fought north and south of the Great Wall in the Huaihai Campaign or in the liberation of Northwest China, said in unison: We will never tolerate this aggression! Bayonet fighting hero Zhang Xuezhi, special-class merit recipients Lü Shunbao, Wang Hongxi, Wang Dianyuan, Lei Rongtian, Ma Wanxin, Song Shuanglai, Liu Kaiyuan, artillery hero Bai Bingsuo and others all spoke at the meeting. They unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely protect the integrity of the motherland's territorial sovereignty and to prepare everything to counter the U.S. aggressors. Special-class merit recipient Zhang Huifeng pointed out: We, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, have learned a truth in the long struggle with the enemy -- peace can never be obtained by begging. Aggressors cannot be condoned; any provocative behavior must be resolutely crushed. The heroes and model workers present unanimously passed a telegram to the United Nations Security Council, protesting the U.S. imperialist atrocities.
