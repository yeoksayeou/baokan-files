　　On the Question of Editions
　　Chen Boda
　　Editor's Note: This article is a speech given by Comrade Chen Boda at the National Xinhua Bookstore Publishing Work Conference on October 14, 1949. The title was added by the editor. Although the speech was given nearly a year ago, the issues raised still exist seriously today. We are publishing this article, along with the Beijing Library's views on editions, in the hope of arousing the attention of publishing workers.

　　I have long heard that everyone is holding a National Publishing Work Conference here, which is very meaningful. But I haven't had the opportunity to participate, which I regret very much. Today I came here, and the comrades asked me to say a few words. I have no research on the work of this department and cannot say much. I would only like to express some opinions on the issue of "editions" in publishing work.

　　People engaged in publishing work often overlook an important issue in publishing—the issue of editions—thinking that publishing a book is not a difficult task. As long as the author gives us the manuscript, we typeset and print it, make the printing good, and make the cover beautiful, we have fulfilled our responsibilities; as for whether the content of the book is typeset incorrectly, or whether the proofreading is done well, we don’t care. This is a hasty attitude of "publishing for the sake of publishing," which is not responsible to the author or to the reader. If we do not pay serious attention to this, we will often make big mistakes. In the past, *Liberation Daily* published in Yan'an had many typos at the beginning. Later, Chairman Mao pointed out that we should pay attention to this issue and strive to make it error-free. Because this task was elevated to a political task, the newspaper gradually improved, and the number of typos decreased. Because of Chairman Mao's attention to this issue, everyone can see that the proofreading of books published in Yan'an was indeed not bad for a period of time. Many people often say that the editions of many books and documents published in Yan'an are better. Of course, it is not easy for our publishing work to be done well sometimes, due to the limitations of the objective environment. At that time, many of our areas were divided by the enemy, the printing industry was rudimentary, and many documents and even books had to be sent via radio telegram, which easily led to many jokes and errors. However, if we are limited by objective conditions and the telegram is wrong, is there no way for us to deal with it? No. As long as we take a serious attitude towards our work, if there are doubts about the telegram, we can send a telegram to inquire; if we still don't understand, we can ask again. It is best to understand it before we print it. If the article is really unreadable, we would rather not print it, because printing erroneous things will have a bad influence. Therefore, for a publishing worker, in addition to the article being the main condition for publication, proofreading is the most important work. First of all, we must do a good job of proofreading, and then we can pay attention to issues such as cover binding. Proofreading is a difficult task. People in the past called proofreading "校雠 [xiào chóu]," which I didn't understand very well before. Later, Chairman Mao gave a speech once and explained its meaning, and I realized that it meant that we should treat correcting typos as fighting against the enemy. I have several books that I have proofread myself, again and again, thinking that there would be no mistakes, but there are still mistakes in the end, which shows the difficulty of proofreading. But we cannot give up conquering it just because it is difficult.

　　Secondly, I want to mention the issue of reprinting. If we want to reprint a book, we cannot just reprint it once in the same way, print it out, and ignore the author completely. We must ask the author before reprinting whether he needs to revise, add, or delete anything, or if there are any typos to correct. A book has its temporality. If something published in the past is reprinted today, there may be some new problems, and the author may need to add or modify something, or add some explanation. The publisher should consider this issue and give the author a good opportunity to correct or explain his work. He can also decide whether some books need to be reprinted. If there is no need to reprint, then don't reprint; if there is no need to revise, then don't revise. This method of soliciting the author's opinions is of great benefit to both readers and authors. Today, our publishing workers still often overlook this procedure. For example, the day before yesterday, I received a reprinted edition of *An Overview of Modern Chinese Land Rent*, which did not state when it was first published, or what edition it was reprinted or copied from, and, most importantly, it deleted an explanation I made in the first edition. In this way, readers will not be able to understand when this book was written. The materials quoted in the book are all from five or six years ago, and often mention the term "wartime." So, what "wartime" is this? Is it the "wartime" of the Anti-Japanese War, or the "wartime" of the People's Liberation War since 1946? This is difficult to grasp. Readers who are not specialists in this issue will find it difficult to understand this situation. Therefore, I think that every book of ours should clearly state when it was published and when it was reprinted. It is also necessary to indicate what edition the reprint is based on. This also illustrates whether our publishing workers attach importance to the historical point of view. What is the historical point of view? Our readers also read a book from a historical point of view. When was this book published, and where was it published? What is the cutoff date for the materials it contains? These questions may all affect the degree to which he understands this work. Therefore, every one of our publications must state the date of publication, the place of publication, the date of reprinting, the place of reprinting, and the edition on which it is based. For example, published by Xinhua Bookstore in Beijing on a certain day, month, and year, reprinted in Shanghai on a certain day, month, and year, based on the nth edition in a certain place, etc. If there are additions or deletions, it should be explained, and certain chapters have been revised or added or deleted. A version that has been added to or changed by the author is different from the original version. We can help readers avoid many difficulties or misunderstandings by printing books based on good versions, which is a great benefit to readers. In the past, our country attached great importance to editions, and there was a discipline called "版本学 [bǎnběn xué]," which is the study of editions. Today, our publishing workers should never ignore this issue. Furthermore, we must also pay attention to the editions of many books we are translating now. Foreign editions also have new and old versions, as well as additions and deletions. Therefore, we must translate based on the latest and most accurate version.

　　I will repeat it again:

　　Today, our publishing workers can no longer "publish for the sake of publishing." We must raise the work of publishing to the height of political principles. In addition to strictly and cautiously reviewing the manuscripts themselves, the first thing to pay attention to is proofreading; second, when reprinting, be sure to ask the author whether he needs to revise, add, or change anything, or if he has any explanations; third, when reprinting, indicate which edition is being reprinted from. We must regard this work as the most serious political work and be responsible to the people and to the revolution.

　　I can't think of anything else, so I'll just say this little bit.

### 关于版本问题

专栏：

　　关于版本问题
    陈伯达
    编者按：本文是陈伯达同志于一九四九年十月十四日在全国新华书店出版工作会议上的讲话，题目是编者加的。讲话的时候距今虽将近一年，但所提出的问题直到今天还是严重地存在着。我们发表此文，并同时发表了北京图书馆对版本题的一些意见，希望借此唤起出版工作者的注意。
    早就听说大家在这里开全国出版工作会议，这是很有意义的。可是一直没有机会来参加，很感遗憾。今天到了这里，同志们要我来讲几句话。我对这一部门的工作没有任何研究，讲不出什么，仅就出版工作上的“版本”这一问题来表示一些意见。
    搞出版工作的人，常常忽略了在出版上一个重要的问题——版本问题，以为出版一本书并不是一件困难的事，只要作者把稿子交给我们，我们把它排印出来，印刷得好，封面搞美观一些，就算尽到我们的责任；至于书的内容有没有排错，校对是否校好，就一概不管。这只是“为出版而出版”的草率态度，没有对作者负责，也没有对读者负责。如果不提出严重的注意，是会常常闹出很大的错误来的。从前在延安出版的《解放周报》，开始错字很多，后来毛主席提出要重视这个问题，要把它搞到一字不错。由于把这个任务提高到政治任务去，结果才把这个周报渐渐搞好，错字也就少了。因为经过毛主席对这问题的重视，大家才可以看到，有一个时期延安出版的书籍，校对的确不差。许多人常说很多书籍和文件的版本是以延安出版的为好。当然，我们的出版工作，有时不容易搞好，是受了客观环境的限制。那时我们许多地区都被敌人分割着，印刷事业很简陋，而且许多文件甚至书籍，都是要经过无线电报来拍发的，因此就容易弄出许多笑话和错误来。但是，受了客观的限制，电报错了，是不是我们就没有办法呢？不会的。只要我们对工作采取认真的态度，电报传达有了疑问，我们不妨去电询问，再不明白，我们再问。最好把它弄明白了我们才印。文章真的读不下去，我们就宁可不要印它，因为印了错误的东西，反而会发生坏的影响。因此，对一个出版工作者来说，除了文章是选择出版的主要条件以外，校对是第一重要的工作。首先必须要把校对这一桩工作搞好，其次才能注意那些封面装钉之类的问题。校对这个工作，是一个困难的工作。前代的人把校对叫做“校雠”，我以前不求甚解，还不大懂得这是什么意思，后来毛主席有一次演讲，说了它的意思，我才知道是要我们把校对错字当做和敌人斗争来看。我有几本书，都是我自己校过的，一遍二遍的校，以为不会错了，但结果还是有错，可见校对之难。但是我们不能因为它困难就不去征服它。
    其次我要提到的是再版的问题。我们如果要再版一本书，我们不能依样画葫芦地再版一次，印出就算，对作者完全置诸不理。我们必得在再版之先，先问一问作者，关于要再版的书，他需不需要修订增删，或有错字要改正。一本书是有它的时间性的。从前出版的东西，今天拿来再版，可能有些新的问题，作者可能需要增添或修改，或者加上什么说明。出版者就应当考虑这一个问题，给予作者对他的作品一个很好的改正或说明的机会。他也可以决定有些书是否有再版的必要。如果不需要再版就不必再版，不需要修订就不必再修订。这种征求作者意见的方法，对于读者和作者都是有很大的益处的。今天我们的出版工作者，仍然时常忽略了这一种手续。例如前天我接到一本再版的《近代中国地租概说》，其中没有说明何年何月初版，或根据什么版本再版或翻版的字样，而且最重要的一点，是把我在初版时的一个说明给删掉了。这样，就会使读者无法明白这本书是在什么时候写的。书里面所引的材料都是五六年前的材料，而且常常提到战时的字样。那么这战时，是什么“战时”呢？是抗日战争时期的“战时”呢？还是一九四六年以来人民解放战争的“战时”呢？这就使人难以捉摸了。这种情形，读者如不是一个专门研究这一问题的人，是很难理解的。所以我以为：我们的每一本书都要印明何时出版，何时再版。翻版所根据的是什么版本，也必需加以注明。这也就是说明我们的出版工作者重不重视历史观点的问题。什么是历史观点呢？我们的读者读一本书，他也要以历史观点来阅读的。这书是什么时候出版的，在什么地方出版？它所收的材料，截至何时为止？这些问题，都可能影响到他读这一本著作的理解程度。因此我们的每一种出版物，都必需注明出版年月、出版地点。再版年月、再版地点、根据什么地方的版本等。比如某年某月某日在北京新华书店出版，某年某月某日在上海再版，根据的是某某地方的第几版之类。有了增删或修改就应当加以说明，某某章节已经改动或已经增删。一个版本经过作者的增改就与原来的版本有了分别，我们根据好的版本印出书来，就可以帮助读者省却了许多困难或不了解的问题，对读者是一个大大的好处。我国过去对版本很重视，有一种学问称做“版本学”的，就是专门研究版本的学问。今天我们的出版工作者，决不应当忽视这一个问题。再说现在我们翻译的许多书籍，也必须讲究外国文的版本。外国的版本，也有新旧，也有增删。所以我们必须根据最新的、最正确的版本来翻译。
    我再重复地说一遍：
    今天我们的出版工作者，不能再“为出版而出版”，必须把出版这一工作提到政治原则性的高度，除了稿件本身自应严格审慎外，第一要重视的是校对；第二，在再版时一定要问作者是否需要修订、增改或者有什么说明；第三，翻版时要注出所翻的是根据何种版本。我们要把这一工作认为是最严肃的政治工作，对人民对革命都要负责。
    其他想不出什么，就说这一点点吧。
