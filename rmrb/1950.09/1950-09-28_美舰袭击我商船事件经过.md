Xinhua News Agency, Andong, September 27th: The following is an account of the incident on September 21st in which a US warship attacked a Chinese merchant ship:

　　The "Anhai No. 21" merchant ship, belonging to the Andong Port Authority of the Northeast People's Government Navigation Administration Bureau, set sail from Shidao, the southeastern corner of the Shandong Peninsula, at 13:00 on September 20th, returning to Andong. The ship carried eight male, four female, and two child Chinese passengers, as well as six pieces of cotton cloth. At 22:45 on September 21st, the ship was sailing approximately fifty nautical miles from Chengshantou (i.e., Chengshan Cape) on the Shandong Peninsula of the Yellow Sea in China (38 degrees 11 minutes 30 seconds North latitude, 123 degrees 6 minutes East longitude). At this time, it was suddenly attacked by a US warship. Initially, four shells landed to the left rear of our ship, and two flares exploded above the ship. Because the ship and the surrounding sea were fully illuminated, the ship was forced to stop to prevent the US warship from firing on us again. Immediately afterwards, the US warship fired again around our merchant ship, and continuously launched six flares.

　　Twenty-five minutes after firing on our ship, the US warship sped from the southwest rear of our ship, and an aircraft circled above our ship at the same time. The US warship circled our ship from the right rear with a searchlight, and then turned the bow and anchored about three or four meters from the left rear of our ship. At this time, the captain of our ship, Li Qingquan, the chief mate, Li Wenguang, and the helmsman, Zhang Liangchen, personally saw that the ship was a gray US destroyer with large white letters "D29" on the hull, and an aircraft was parked on the deck at the stern. Initially, an American asked in English, "What country is this ship from?" The captain of our ship, Li Qingquan, replied, "It is a Chinese merchant ship." Later, because he did not understand English, he could not answer. At this time, the US warship changed to a Chinese person to continue the unreasonable questioning. Then, all fourteen passengers and eleven crew members were forced to line up on the deck and were questioned for about twenty minutes before the US warship left.

　　美舰袭击我商船事件经过
    【新华社安东二十七日电】九月二十一日美国军舰袭击我国商船。事件经过如下：
    我东北人民政府航政总局安东港湾管理局所属“安海二一号”商船于九月二十日十三时由山东半岛东南角之石岛起锚返安东，船上载有中国旅客男八名，女四名，小孩二名及棉布六件。二十一日二十二时四十五分船行至距我国黄海岸山东半岛之成山头（即成山角）约五十海里处（北纬三十八度十一分三十秒、东经一二三度六分）。此时突然遭到美国军舰炮击。起初有四发炮弹落于我船之左后方，两颗照明弹在该轮船上空爆炸。因船身及其周围海面全被照亮，为防止美舰再向我发炮，该船乃被迫停航。紧接着，美舰又向我商船周围发炮，并连续发射了六颗照明弹。
    美舰在向我船发炮二十五分钟后，即从我船西南角后方飞速驶来，同时并有一架飞机在我船上空盘旋。该美舰自我船右后方以探照灯绕行探视一周，即掉转舰首，在距我船左后方约三四米处停舶。我船长李清泉、大副李文光及舵手张良臣，在此时曾亲见该舰系一灰色并在舰身上书有白字大型的“Ｄ２９”字样的美国驱逐舰，在尾部舰面上尚停有一架飞机。开始时，一美国人操英语盘问我船“是那国船”。我船长李清泉告以“是中国商船”。后即因不懂英语，不能对答。此时美舰即改换一中国人继续进行无理盘问。接着又强令十四名旅客及十一名船员全部上船面排成行列，盘问了约二十分钟，然后离开。
