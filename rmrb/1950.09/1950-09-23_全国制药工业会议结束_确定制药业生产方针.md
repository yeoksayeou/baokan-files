Xinhua News Agency Report: The National Pharmaceutical Industry Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Light Industry and the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, has formulated the future production policy and the 1951 production plan for the pharmaceutical industry. The future production policy of the pharmaceutical industry will focus on manufacturing raw pharmaceutical materials. The conference stipulated 223 types of raw pharmaceutical materials that can be manufactured domestically, are inexpensive, or are essential. Among these, 147 types already have the conditions to be completely self-sufficient domestically; 20 types can be partially self-sufficient; and 56 types are currently not self-sufficient but efforts must be made to achieve self-sufficiency as soon as possible. The conference also preliminarily allocated production quotas to each major administrative region based on the production capacity of public and private pharmaceutical factories in each region; each region will then formulate detailed production plans based on specific conditions and submit them to the central government for approval.

The conference also determined various principles and specific methods regarding raw material and finished product sales, public-private relations, and other issues.

In terms of business management, the conference believes that in the future, pharmaceutical factories must exchange technology and experience with each other, improve business management, relocate inland, or organize joint ventures to effectively improve quality and reduce costs, so as to supply the people of the whole country with effective and low-priced medicines.

Regarding traditional Chinese medicine, the conference proposed that in the future, efforts should be made to systematically organize and study it, using scientific methods to extract and prepare medicines, in order to guide traditional Chinese medicine towards a scientific path.

The conference was held in Beijing from August 25th to September 1st. In addition to representatives from relevant central government departments, there were also 78 representatives from industrial and health departments of major administrative regions and public and private pharmaceutical factories attending the conference.
