　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. The Korean people, who are fighting for the independence and unification of their motherland, are extremely angry about the gangsterism of US imperialist aircraft intruding into the airspace of the People's Republic of China and killing Chinese people. Gao Ying-suk, a worker at a certain factory, said after hearing the news: "This crime of the US aggressors has further inspired the fighting will of the Korean people. I believe that the great 475 million Chinese people will surely be able to crush the aggressive crimes of the US imperialists and carry out unremitting struggles to liberate Taiwan and defend world peace." Li Jin-soon, Vice-Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Women's League, said: "We are extremely indignant at the provocative act of the US imperialist bandits in violating Chinese airspace. All Korean women are willing to join hands with the Chinese people to fight against the common enemy of the Chinese and Korean people – the US imperialists." Kim Hyung-soon, a farmer from the South Korean People's Observation Group, said: "The US aggressors are destroying our peaceful construction and production, and now they are provoking the Chinese people. We Koreans must unite closely with the Chinese people to crush the aggression of the US imperialists."

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th. According to the Korean Central News Agency, Seoul: People from all walks of life in Seoul are extremely indignant at the outrageous act of US aircraft unreasonably invading the airspace of the People's Republic of China. Cao Tu-ming, a worker at the Seoul Electric Company, said: "All Chinese workers will surely be able to crush any aggressive conspiracy of the US imperialists and defend the honor of their motherland. I am willing to work unremittingly until the US aggressive troops are completely driven out of the territories of China and Korea."

　　Liu Xue-lie, a farmer from Cangyi Village, Gapyeong District, Gapyeong County, Gyeonggi Province, said: "This provocative act by the US imperialists can only further arouse the anger of peace-loving and freedom-loving people all over the world, and urge them to strengthen their unity. The Chinese people will never allow the US imperialists to touch an inch of Chinese land, and they will surely liberate Taiwan."

　　Kim Jin, a young man from Jongno District, Seoul, and Kim Hyun-jang, a Christian pastor, also made speeches, pointing out that the new aggressive acts of the US imperialists will eventually be settled by the people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th. This newspaper "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 5th entitled "US Aircraft's Intrusion into Chinese Territory is Another Crime Against Peace," stating: "The US imperialists are strengthening their armed intervention in our country on the one hand, and illegally invading the airspace of our friendly neighbor, the People's Republic of China, on the other hand. This is an act of aggression against the People's Republic of China. We, the Korean people, express our anger at the atrocities of US aircraft bombing and strafing our friendly Chinese people who love peace and freedom. We support the proposal and serious protest made by Zhou Enlai, Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, to the Security Council and the US government. We believe that it is a legitimate measure to maintain lasting peace."

　　The editorial emphasized: "In order to avoid further deterioration of the situation, the Korean people advocate that the Security Council must take measures in accordance with the protest of the People's Republic of China to stop the conspiracy of the US aggressors to expand the scope of aggression and to ensure that the US aggressive troops withdraw from Korea as soon as possible."
