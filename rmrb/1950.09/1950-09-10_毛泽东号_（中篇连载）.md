　　Mao Zedong Steamer
    (Serial Novel)
    By Ding Kexin and Qingying, Illustrated by Zhuangyan
    Twenty-one, "People say Guo Shude is progressing fast!..."
    In August 1948, Guo Shude, a 26-year-old young driver, and Wang Qingquan and Yang Daofang, two apprentice stokers in their twenties, came to the "Mao Zedong" steamer.
    First, they went to the crew rest room.
    As soon as Shang Baoheng saw them, she fluffed her long hair and lay on the bed, staring at the rafters. Zheng Dugong sniffed twice and deliberately coughed a couple of times. Some of the others were sitting, some standing, some nodding, and some not saying a word. Only the old hero greeted them with a smile and shook hands.
    Guo Shude was stunned for a moment, then went outside to talk with the old hero.
    As soon as they left, Lao Shang sat up and said to Zheng Dugong:
    "Sniffle less from now on, a Party member and a special-class hero are on the train, so be careful with your nose!" Then he glanced at Wang Qingquan and Yang Daofang.
    Zheng Dugong rolled his eyes:
    "With my more than one hundred pounds holding on, what's there to be afraid of?"
    Lao Shang spat hard and said:
    "What if he's a Party member? What if he's a hero? Aren't we with wings (flying - non-Party members) still getting two award banners and two major merits, the top-notch locomotive leaders!"
    Hu Chundong said in a sticky voice:
    "Hey, people say Guo Shude is progressing fast. He joined the Party as soon as liberation came, averted three major accidents, earned a special-class merit, and was promoted to driver—" Before he could finish, Lao Shang glared at him:
    "You know what you're saying!"
    Hu Chundong didn't even look at Lao Shang, and said seriously:
    "You want to hear it, I'll say it. - Back then, when liberation came, Guo Shude was a stoker on locomotive 冂考一一九一. In October, they were driving a military train on the downhill section of Xiaojiu Station. Because there were not enough wind pipes, they contacted Mifeng Station at the previous station to not stop at Xiaojiu Station. But as soon as they arrived at Xiaojiu Station, the station temporarily wanted them to stop and meet another train. The driver applied emergency braking but couldn't stop the train, and drove onto the dead switch. Not far ahead, there were no more tracks. Do you think that was dangerous? At this time, Guo Shude had already jumped from the water tank to the rear of the cab, and jumped seven cabs in a row, tightening seven handbrakes (Note 1) to stop the train, with less than fifty meters of track left!"
    Another person added: "Otherwise, the train would have overturned in a minute!"
    "What's so great about that?!" Shang Baoheng said with a smile.
    "What's so great about that?!" Hu Chundong said, "That's risking your life!"
    "Continue, continue!" Someone urged.
    Hu Chundong continued:
    "Another time, they were hauling coal at Hengdaohezi—"
    "I know this too," the new young man Zhu Dianji interjected, "A grate bar in the fire bed was knocked off by a stone coal. Seeing that they were about to start the train, the driver was at a loss. Guo Shude found a way to push the fire to the front and cover it with wet coal, and then went into the fire room!"
    "Apprentice stoker Liu Detian followed him in," Hu Chundong continued, "They fixed the grate bar and the train was not delayed... That was the second time, and there was a third time..."
    "I heard he also attended the Sixth National Labor Congress?"
    "Commander Lü even ate with him at the hero meeting."
    "He's really got something!"
    Zheng Dugong was unconvinced and gesticulated:
    "If he's got something, he's a person, and if we don't have something, we're still people. He's not a head taller than us!"
    Shang Baoheng also said:
    "Can't you see our locomotive leader?!"
    "What about the locomotive leader?" Someone said, "Anyway, we don't object to some Party members coming. Let's see how they do it, so we can learn from them."
    "Wait a minute," Shang Baoheng said, glancing at Wang Qingquan and Yang Daofang. "You have to see what kind of Party members they are! General Lin Biao is a real Party member, Commander Lü is a real Party member. They are famous all over the world and everyone respects them. In our section, only Representative Song is qualified to be a Party member, and ordinary cadres can't compare. Others, whether they are people or not, have become Party members. Does he know what the Communist Party does? I will definitely ask him to give me a lesson and tell me about it!"
    The two young Communist Party members felt more and more uncomfortable as they listened. Wang Qingquan gently nudged Yang Daofang, and the two of them walked out together.
    The old saint sang along with their footsteps:
    "Empty, bright, empty, bright..."
    Everyone burst into laughter.
    The two of them quickened their pace without even turning their heads.
    Lao Shang punched Zheng Dugong and said happily:
    "You kid is really a saint, you have all the tricks."
    Note 1: Hand-operated wheel stopper, every car has one.

　　毛泽东号
    （中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作  庄言插图
    二十一、“人家郭树德可是进步快！……”
    一九四八年八月，二十六岁的青年司机郭树德，二十来岁的学习司炉王清权和杨道芳等三个人来到“毛泽东号”。
    先到乘务员休息室里。
    商宝恒一见，扑拢了一下长头发，躺在床上瞪着眼看房梁。郑笃恭吸溜了两下鼻子，还故意咳嗽了两声。其他的人坐着的，站着的，有的点点头，有的没作声。只有老英雄笑着打招呼，和他们握手。
    郭树德楞了一阵，就同老英雄到外面谈话去了。
    老商见他二人一走，就坐起来，对郑笃恭说道：
    “以后少吸溜点吧，又是党员又是特等英雄上了车，可小心你那鼻子！”说完又瞟了王清权、杨道芳一眼。
    郑笃恭白眼珠一翻：
    “有我这一百多斤顶住了，怕什么？”
    老商使劲吐了一口唾沫，又说了：
    “党员怎么样？英雄怎么样？咱们这长翅膀的（飞—非党员）还不是两面奖旗两大功，顶呱呱机车领袖！”
    胡春东粘粘糊糊的说：
    “哎，人家郭树德可是进步快，刚一解放就入了党，避免了三次大事故，立了特等功，升了司机——”他还没有说完，老商就用眼珠子瞪他：
    “你知道你说！”
    胡春东看也不看老商，认真说道：
    “你想听我就说。——刚解放那时候，郭树德在冂考一一九一号机车当司炉。十月间，他们开军用车过小九站那段下坡路，因为风管不够用，在前一站密峰站就联系好，过小九站不停车。可是一到小九站，站上临时又要他们停会车，司机下非常制动也停不住车，开到了死岔子上，前面不远就没有路轨，你看危险不危险？这时候郭树德已经从水柜跳到后面的车棚上，接连跳了七个车棚拧了七个手闸（注一）才把车停住，剩下路轨不到五十米了！”
    别一个加上说：“要不，差一分钟也得翻车！”
    “那有什么了不起？！”商宝恒笑道。
    “有什么了不起？！”胡春东说：“那是豁着命干哪！”
    “讲下去讲下去！”有人催促道。
    胡春东就继续讲道：
    “还有一回，他们开到横道河子上煤——”
    “这我也知道，”新来的小青年朱殿吉接住道：“火床有一根炉条被石头煤碰掉了，眼看就要开车，司机抓了瞎。郭树德想法把火推到前面用湿煤压住，就钻进火室里去了！”
    “学习司炉刘德田跟着也钻了进去，”胡春东又接着说：“把炉条整好，车没晚点。……这是第二次，还有第三次……”
    “听说参加第六次全国劳动大会也有他？”
    “英雄会上吕司令员还和他一块儿吃过饭。”
    “人家真有两下！”
    郑笃恭偏不服，指手划脚说道：
    “他有两下是个人，咱没两下也是个人，他比咱也不高一等啊！”
    商宝恒也说：
    “你们就看不见咱们这机车领袖？！”
    “机车领袖怎么样？”谁说：“反正来些党员咱不反对，看看他们到底怎样干的，咱好跟他学。”
    “慢着，”商宝恒道，又瞟了王清权、杨道芳一眼：“你得看什么样的党员！林彪将军是真正党员，吕司令员是真正党员，人家全世界都有名，人人尊敬。咱段上就是宋代表够个党员的资格，一般干部比不了，别的是人不是人也成了党员，他知道共产党是干什么的？我非叫他给我上一课讲讲不行！”
    两个青年共产党员越听越不是味，很不自在。王清权就轻轻地用手捅了杨道芳一下，两个人就一同走出去了。
    老圣人按着两人的脚步唱道：
    “空空，光光，空空，光光……”
    大家都哈哈大笑。
    他二人连头也不回加快的走了。
    老商捶了郑笃恭一拳，高兴地说道：
    “你小子真是圣人，什么招儿也有。”
    注一：手摇止轮器，每辆车上都有一个。
