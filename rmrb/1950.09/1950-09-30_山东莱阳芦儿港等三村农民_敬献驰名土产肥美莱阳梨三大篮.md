Farmers from Luergang and other three villages in Laiyang, Shandong,
Respectfully Present Three Baskets of Famous Local Produce: Delicious Laiyang Pears
[Our Newspaper News] According to Shandong Dazhong Daily news: Farmers from Luergang, Xiaogezhuang, and Houzhaowang villages in Taozhang District, Laiyang County, Shandong Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on this autumn's bumper harvest and wheat planting situation; and respectfully sent three baskets of the nationally renowned Laiyang pears to celebrate the founding of the People's Republic of China. The letter from the farmers of Luergang Village to Chairman Mao reads:
"Dear Chairman Mao: This autumn, all the crops have grown well, and the grain yield is high. Millet averages 250 jin per mu, sorghum and corn average 300 jin per mu, sweet potatoes are thick and long, and peanuts are plentiful and full. We have not seen such good crops as this year in over twenty years. It is truly a year of abundant harvests. This is all because you led us to get land, turned us over, and everyone worked hard in production to achieve such a bountiful year." The farmers of Xiaogezhuang Village wrote in their letter to Chairman Mao: "In the past, our village had less than half a mu of land per person on average, and we were often unable to eat or dress warmly. Since you led us to implement land reform, we have an average of two and a half mu of land per person, and everyone is working hard on their own land and actively producing. Now the number of livestock in the village has increased from 36 to 60; and every household is living a good life and has new cotton clothes. This autumn, in addition to generally applying farm manure, our village also applied more than 8,000 jin of bean cake to wheat planting, striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year." These three villages are the most abundant production areas of "Laiyang Pears." In order to celebrate the birthday of the People's Republic of China, the farmers from the three villages picked a large number of sweet and delicious pears from their pear trees, packed three large baskets, and transported them to the capital to offer to Chairman Mao.

　　山东莱阳芦儿港等三村农民
    敬献驰名土产肥美莱阳梨三大篮
    【本报讯】据山东大众日报消息：山东莱阳县淘漳区芦儿港、肖格庄、后赵旺三个村农民，写信给毛主席，报告今秋丰收和种麦情况；并敬送驰名全国的莱阳梨三大篮，庆祝中华人民共和国的国庆。芦儿港村农民给毛主席的信上写着：
    “亲爱的毛主席：今秋庄稼样样长得好，打的粮食多，谷子平均每市亩产二百五十斤，高粱、苞米每市亩产三百斤，地瓜长的又粗又长，花生又多又饱，二十多年来，从未见过今年这样的好庄稼，真是五谷丰收年。这全是您领导咱们分得了土地，翻了身，大家努力生产，才获得这样的丰收年。”肖格庄村农民在给毛主席的信上写着：“从前俺村每人平均不到半亩地，常年吃不饱穿不暖。自从您领导俺们实行了土地改革后，每人平均有了二亩半地，大家在自己的土地上卖力干活，积极生产。现在全村的牲口已由三十六头增加到六十头；并且户户都过上了好日子，有了新棉衣。今秋种麦，俺村除了普遍增施圈肥外，又施豆饼八千余斤，争取明年小麦的丰收。”该三个村是出产“莱阳梨”最盛的地方，三个村的农民们，为了庆祝中华人民共和国的诞生日，他们从自己的梨树上，摘下大批甘美的梨子，装了三大篮，运往首都去，献给毛主席。
