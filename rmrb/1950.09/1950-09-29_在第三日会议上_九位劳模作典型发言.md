Xinhua News Agency, September 27th: At today's National Model Workers Representative Conference, nine model workers from industry and agriculture gave speeches. Ma Hengchang, the leader of the production team at the Northeast Shenyang Machine Tool Factory No. 5, is the standard-bearer for production teams nationwide. His team, through the implementation of a scientific and strict inspection system, responsibility system, and assembly line operation, had completed its production tasks ahead of schedule from April 1949 to February this year. Eight workers in the team produced no defective products throughout the year, and seven workers set new records ten times and improved eighteen kinds of tools. Ma Hengchang's team's advanced experience is being promoted nationwide.

Liang Jun, the first female tractor driver in New China, is now the captain of the first female tractor team at the Heilongjiang Dedu Farm. She has pointed out a bright future for women farmers in New China.

Li Jinghua, a model passenger train conductor, leads the "Masses" train car team, which has become a warmly supported train by passengers. They take meticulous care of the PLA wounded and sick soldiers, pregnant women about to give birth, elderly people who have fallen and injured their feet, and general passengers. Their exemplary behavior has deeply moved the patients themselves and their families, who have expressed their intention to repay them with practical actions in production and on the front lines.

Zhao Lan, the director of the Shenyang Smelting Plant, is a model director. He implemented the principle of the Party, government, and trade union working together to focus on production in the factory very early on. He is good at uniting and cultivating technical personnel and can humbly listen to the opinions of employees, promoting a large number of workers to serve as management personnel in the workshops. In terms of management, he combines the creation of new records with cost accounting. This has transformed a factory that used to frequently fail to complete its production tasks into a factory that exceeds the highest production record of the puppet Manchukuo by 100% and has improved the quality of its products to 99.95%.

Hou Deyuan, a model engineer, is the designer of the "Eight-Eight" type long-distance telephone line cross-program. The success of this design has made a great contribution to the construction of the people's telecommunications industry. It not only reduces the crosstalk rate by 30% compared to the "K-Eight" type crossover designed by the Americans, but also saves a large amount of materials and manpower, and each pair of lines can carry three carrier telephone circuits. This design is being widely adopted nationwide.

Wei Zhenhua, a model for modifying oil presses at the Tianjin Vegetable Oil Factory, reported at the meeting the efficiency of his modified oil press: In the past, each machine could press three tons of cottonseed in 20 hours, but now it has been increased to four and a half tons, and the oil content in the cake has also been reduced from 12% to 8.5%. As a result, the factory's production efficiency has rapidly increased. Before liberation, the factory pressed 400 tons of cottonseed oil per month; in May of this year, it had increased to 2,100 tons.

Wang Zhentang, a model cadre leading agricultural production, is the village chief of Zhangjiaweizi Village in Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province. Thanks to his active leadership, this poor village, which was once known as a "place of mountain wolves and water thieves," has quickly become a prosperous village. In 1947, the village had only 64 hectares of cultivated land; now it has increased to 209 hectares. The number of livestock has increased from 34 at that time to 86 now. He systematically organized the village's sideline production. Men fished and collected firewood, while women and children picked mushrooms and cut cattail grass. In the past three years, the income has been more than 88 million yuan. Last year, the income from sideline occupations alone bought seven horses and a large cart.

Wang Qingheng, a model representative of forest protection, is the forest ranger of Chunsheng Village, Second District, Muling County, Songjiang Province. Thanks to his active responsibility, the forests in the area are well protected, preventing fires. His greatest strength is that he frequently mobilizes the masses to do forest protection work. He often explains the importance of forest protection to the masses at meetings or individually. He uses various methods to remind the masses of the importance of timber. Due to his mobilization, villages and people in various districts of Muling County have signed fire prevention guarantees with each other, launching a vigorous forest protection movement.

Han En, a model of agricultural production mutual aid, is an outstanding agricultural production organizer in Jilin Province. In difficult circumstances, he persuaded the farmers in the whole village to organize mutual aid groups, and constantly improved the mutual aid methods in the process of organization, actively promoted new agricultural tools, improved agricultural technology, and established a reasonable division of labor and responsibility system, saving labor to develop sideline production. All 27 households in the group, except for the three new ones who moved in last year, have all risen to become middle peasants or well-to-do middle peasants. The village originally had no vehicles or livestock, but now it has 14 head of livestock and 14 large carts.

    新中国第一个女拖拉机手梁军现在是黑龙江德都农场第一支女拖拉机队的队长，她为新中国的农妇指出了光明的远景。
    模范客运车长李静华领导的群众号列车包车组，已成为旅客们热烈拥护的列车。他们对乘车的解放军伤病员、临产的产妇、摔伤脚的老人以及一般旅客，照料得体贴入微，他们这种模范行为，使病员自己和病员家属，深受感动，都表示要在生产中和在前线上用实际行动来报答他们。

    天津植物油厂改造榨油机模范魏振华在会上报告了他改造后的榨油机效率：过去每台机器二十小时榨棍子三吨，现提高到四吨半，而且饼内的含油量也由过去的百分之十二降低到百分之八·五。因此，使该厂生产效率迅速提高。解放前每月榨四百吨棉油，今年五月已提高到二千一百吨。
    领导农业生产的模范干部王振堂是黑龙江省肇源县张家围子村的村长，由于他的积极领导，这个一向被称为“山狼水贼之地”的穷村，很快变成了富村。一九四七年该村尚只有耕地六十四垧，现在已增至二百零九垧；牲畜由当时的三十四头增加到现在的八十六头。他有计划地组织了全村的副业生产，男人打鱼打柴，妇女儿童拾蘑菇、割靰鞡草，三年来收入八千八百余万元，去年副业收入就买了七匹马和一辆大车。
    护林模范代表王清恒是松江省穆棱县二区纯盛村的护林员，由于他的积极负责，使该区的林木保护得很好，防止了火灾。他最大的长处是经常发动群众来做护林工作，他经常在会议上或个别的向群众讲解护林的重要性，他用各种办法提醒群众对于木材的重视。由于他的发动，穆棱县各区村与村、人与人互相订出了防火保证，展开了一个轰轰烈烈的护林运动。
    农业生产互助模范韩恩是吉林省的一个出色的农业生产组织者。他在艰难情况下，说服全屯农民组织互助组，并在组织过程中随时改进互助方式，积极推广新式农具，改进农业技术，并建立起合理的分工负责制，节省出劳力去发展副业。全组二十七户，除去年新搬来的三户外，已全部上升为中农或富裕中农。该村原来没车也没牲口，现在已有十四头牲口，十四辆大车。
