　　On August 23rd, the First District People's Government of Guan County, Pingyuan Province, convened a meeting of veterans of the revolutionary war. At the meeting, veterans Song Shizhong and Gao Xinyu were selected as production models. Song Shizhong said at the meeting: "I joined the army in 1942 and retired in 1946. I went through four years of the War of Resistance Against Japan and one year of the War of Liberation. I was gloriously wounded in the war, and therefore returned to the rear to participate in the production front. Now I have seventeen mu of land and have been elected as a district model, serving as a member of the village armed committee. Now I hear that American imperialism is invading Taiwan and Korea. Although I cannot join the army, I have signed the peace declaration. In the future, I will lead the masses in active production and use practical actions to defend world peace." (Liu Yong, Cheng Jianfeng)
