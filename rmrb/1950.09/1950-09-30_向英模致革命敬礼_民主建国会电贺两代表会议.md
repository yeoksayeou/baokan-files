    As we approach National Day, the historic gathering of national combat heroes demonstrates that the birth of New China is the result of the People's Liberation Army's arduous struggle, extraordinary bravery, and skillful combat. Our association extends to you our revolutionary respects and warm congratulations!

    In the long struggle of the people's revolution, thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, thanks to the strong unity of the people of the whole country, and even more so thanks to your bloody battles, risking your lives, and bringing into full play your patriotic and people-loving enthusiasm, we have finally overthrown the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. You have created countless glorious and moving achievements, writing a brilliant page in Chinese history!

    Today, the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, relying on the protection of American imperialism, is still making a dying struggle in Taiwan, and the people of the whole country resolutely demand the liberation of this sacred territory. We are confident that the invincible People's Liberation Army, with you heroes as its model, will certainly be able to completely eliminate the remaining bandits! Our association is willing to make great efforts to unite industrialists and businessmen throughout the country, under the leadership of the working class, to develop production, prosper the economy, and support this final battle!
