　　Paris Chinese Students Association in France Sends Letter to All-China Students' Federation
    Report on the Destruction of Meeting Place by Remnant Bandits and Secret Agents
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 15th] The General Association of Chinese Students in France, Paris, sent a letter to the All-China Students' Federation on the 11th, reporting on the incident where war criminal Chen Lifu, after his plot to buy hooligans in Paris to persecute patriotic overseas Chinese was exposed, directed secret agent thugs to destroy the association's meeting place on the 10th. The letter stated: "All Chinese students in Paris, in addition to having filed a lawsuit according to law, demanding that the French government severely punish the thugs and compensate for the losses, will intensify the unity of overseas Chinese, heighten vigilance, and organize themselves closely. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we will take more resolute actions to cooperate with the revolutionary construction of the motherland, smash the provocations and atrocities of Kuomintang secret agent hooligans, and eliminate the remaining reactionary forces of the Chiang bandits overseas."
    Furthermore, the thugs who destroyed the student association kidnapped and injured Tan Zhengxin, a sixty-year-old overseas Chinese who came to dissuade them, but the French authorities actually released eight of the arrested thugs. On the 11th, the newspaper "l'Humanité" published photos of the destruction of the Chinese Students Association in France and called on the French people to strengthen their vigilance to prevent fascist atrocities.
