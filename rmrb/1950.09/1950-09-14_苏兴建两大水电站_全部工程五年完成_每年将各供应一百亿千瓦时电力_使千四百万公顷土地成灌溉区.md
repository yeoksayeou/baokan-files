Xinhua News Agency, September 13th: The Soviet Council of Ministers recently decided to build the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station on the Volga River, which are the two largest power stations in the world. The construction of these two major power stations demonstrates the further electrification of the socialist Soviet Union and also illustrates the unparalleled growth of Soviet national power.

The construction period for both the Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations is five years. The former commenced construction this year, with a power generation capacity of 2 million kilowatts, while the latter will commence construction next year, with a power generation capacity of at least 1.7 million kilowatts. In years with normal water levels, both will produce 10 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. Compared to the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station (with a power generation capacity of 558,000 kilowatts), which is the largest power station in Europe and one of the main hydroelectric power stations in the Soviet Union, they are 2.5 times and 2 times larger, respectively.

In addition to supplying power, the hydroelectric power stations will also be the center for the construction of water supply systems. The Kuibyshev Power Station will irrigate one million hectares of land in the middle reaches of the Volga River. The Stalingrad Power Station will irrigate 13 million hectares of land in the lower reaches of the Volga River. The Volga region is one of the largest grain-producing areas in southeastern Soviet Union, with a very dry climate. The establishment of powerful hydroelectric power stations will fundamentally change the climatic conditions in the area, which is a major source of dry winds, eliminating drought forever and ensuring bumper harvests in vast areas every year. It will also transform the deserts of the Caspian Lowlands into fertile fields, developing agriculture and animal husbandry. The main distribution of electricity from the two major power stations is as follows: The Kuibyshev Power Station will supply 6 billion kilowatt-hours annually to Moscow, 2.4 billion kilowatt-hours to the Kuibyshev and Saratov regions, and 1.5 billion kilowatt-hours for irrigation of farmland in the Trans-Volga region. The Stalingrad Power Station will supply 4 billion kilowatt-hours annually to Moscow, 1.2 billion kilowatt-hours to the states in the Central Black Earth Region, 2.8 billion kilowatt-hours to the Stalingrad and Saratov regions, and 2 billion kilowatt-hours for water diversion and irrigation in the Volga River and Caspian Sea regions.

The construction of the two major power stations will also change the navigation conditions of the Volga River. The Kuibyshev lock will create enormous water pressure in the upper reaches of the river, while the Stalingrad lock will fundamentally improve navigation conditions in the lower reaches. The former will create a large reservoir of 500 kilometers, deep enough for giant ships to navigate. The latter will also be built into a large reservoir and will reduce the force of the current, improving the river channel of the Volga River downstream for over 1,000 kilometers, thereby greatly accelerating upstream navigation.

The construction projects of the two major hydroelectric power stations are extremely large. The Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station requires the excavation of 150 million cubic meters of earth and the pouring of approximately 6 million cubic meters of cement, as well as large-scale construction projects. The Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station requires the completion of 100 million cubic meters of earthwork and the pouring of approximately 7 million cubic meters of cement, in a place previously considered impossible to build even a small power plant. The construction speed of the two major hydroelectric power stations will be faster than that of the Dnieper Power Station and the Moscow Canal.

Soviet industrial enterprises have sent a large number of new machines to the construction projects to ensure the realization of the plan to complete more than 1,000 cubic meters of reinforced concrete work per hour. During construction, a trailing suction dredger capable of excavating 1,000 cubic meters per hour and powerful electric excavators capable of excavating 200 to 300 cubic meters per hour will be used for the first time, and mooring ropes with a capacity of 14 cubic meters will be used, each mooring rope completing 1.8 million cubic meters of earthwork annually.

The Soviet people fully support this great project to transform nature. Many factories are producing machines for the power stations, and thousands of engineers and technicians have joined the work. The Central Council of the Soviet Engineers and Technicians Association has decided to form a special committee composed of famous scientists and representatives from various departments to assist in the rapid realization of the construction plan.

　　苏兴建两大水电站  全部工程五年完成
    每年将各供应一百亿千瓦时电力  使千四百万公顷土地成灌溉区
    【新华社十三日讯】苏联部长会议最近决定在伏尔加河上建造的古比雪夫水力发电站和斯大林格勒水力发电站，是世界上规模最大的两个电力站。这两大电力站的兴建，说明了社会主义国家苏联的进一步电气化，同时也说明了苏联国力的无比增涨。
    古比雪夫和斯大林格勒水力发电站的建造期限均为五年。前者在今年开工，发电能力为二百万千瓦，后者在明年开工，发电能力至少为一百七十万千瓦。在水位正常的年份，两者每年将均生产一百亿千瓦时的电力。它们和欧洲最大的动力站、苏联主要水电站之一的第聂伯水电站（发电能力为五十五万八千千瓦）相较，分别大二倍半与二倍。
    水电站除了供应动力之外，还将以发电站为中心建造供水系统。古比雪夫发电站将使伏尔加河中游地区的一百万公顷的土地成为灌溉区。斯大林格勒电力站将使伏尔加河下游地区的一千三百万公顷的土地成为灌溉区。伏尔加地区是苏联东南部最大产谷区之一，气候非常干燥，强大水电站的建立将根本改变干风重要来源地区的气候条件，使旱灾永远绝迹，以保证广大地区的年年丰收。并将变里海低地的沙漠为良田，以发展农业和牧畜业。两大电力站的电力主要的分配情形如下：古比雪夫发电站每年以六十千瓦一亿时供应莫斯科，二十四亿千瓦时供应古比雪夫区和萨拉多夫区，十五亿千瓦时供应外伏尔加区的农田灌溉。斯大林格勒发电站每年供应莫斯科四十亿千瓦时，供应中央黑土地带各州十二亿千瓦时，供应斯大林格勒和萨拉多夫等州各区二十八亿千瓦时，供应伏尔加河和里海地区的引水和灌溉二十亿千瓦时。
    两大发电站的修建还将改变伏尔加河的航运情况。古比雪夫水闸要在该河上游造成巨大的水流压力，斯大林格勒水闸则将根本改善下游的航运条件。前者将造成五百公里的大蓄水池，深度足供巨型船只航行。后者亦将建成大蓄水池，并将减弱水流的冲力，改善伏尔加河下游一千多公里的河道，从而大大加速逆流的航行。
    两大水力发电站的建设工程极为浩大。古比雪夫水电站要挖掘一亿五千万立方公尺的土方，灌注约六百万立方公尺的水泥，并要进行大规模的营造工程。斯大林格勒水电站要完成一亿立方公尺的土方工程，灌注约七百万立方公尺的水泥，而这个地方以前是被认为连开一个小发电厂都不可能的。两大水电站的建造速度，将较第聂伯发电站和莫斯科运河为快。
    苏联的工业企业已为建造工程送来了大批新式机器，以保证每小时必须完成一千立方公尺以上的钢骨水泥工程的计划的实现。在兴建时，将首次采用每小时挖掘一千立方公尺的顺水挖泥机，和每小时能挖二百至三百立方公尺的强大的电力挖掘机，并将使用具有十四立方公尺容量的吊斗系留索，每一系留索每年将完成一百八十万立方公尺的土方。
    苏联人民全力支持这一改造自然的伟大工程。许许多多工厂正为电力站生产着机器，成千的工程师与技师已参加了工作。苏联工程师与技师协会中央理事会，已决定由著名的科学家与各部门的代表组成一个专门委员会，协助建筑计划的迅速实现。
