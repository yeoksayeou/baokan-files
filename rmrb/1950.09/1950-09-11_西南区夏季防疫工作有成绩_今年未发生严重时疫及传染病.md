　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 6th. The summer epidemic prevention work in the Southwest Region is nearing its end. Thanks to the efforts of public and private medical workers, no serious epidemics or infectious diseases occurred in various parts of the Southwest this year. Health agencies in various regions, in accordance with the central Ministry of Health's working policy of "prevention first," carried out preventive inoculations of mixed cholera and typhoid vaccines. From the end of May to July, according to statistics published by the New China Daily, 2,050,000 people had been inoculated. Although smallpox, cholera, typhoid, and other epidemic diseases were successively discovered in Ziyang and Jianyang counties in southern Sichuan, Wuxi county in eastern Sichuan, Li county in western Sichuan, and Qujing, Kaiyuan, and Luoping in Yunnan, they were quickly eradicated under the vigorous prevention and treatment efforts of the local people's governments and health agencies. During the epidemic prevention campaign, major and medium-sized cities throughout the region carried out city-wide environmental sanitation campaigns. In Kunming alone, more than 1,200 tons of garbage were removed in six days. Some health workers, when going to the countryside to work, often crossed mountains and worked day and night, overcoming many difficulties in manpower and material resources.

　　西南区夏季防疫工作有成绩
    今年未发生严重时疫及传染病
    【新华社重庆六日电】西南区夏季防疫工作已接近结束。由于公私医务工作者的努力，使西南各地今年未发生严重的时疫和传染病。各地卫生机关遵照中央卫生部“预防为主”的工作方针，进行了霍乱、伤寒混合疫苗的预防注射，从五月底至七月止，据新华日报发表的统计，已有二百零五万人进行注射。虽然川南资阳、简阳二县，川东巫溪县，川西理县，云南曲靖、开远、罗平等地曾先后发现天花、霍乱、伤寒等疫病；川北中江曾发现细菌性痢疾；重庆、成都曾发现夏季脑炎，但都在当地人民政府及卫生机关大力防治下，迅速扑灭。在防疫运动中，全区各大中城市均进行了全市环境的清洁卫生运动，仅昆明一地，在六天之内就清除了一千二百多吨垃圾。有些卫生工作者在下乡进行工作时，经常翻山越岭，夜以继日地工作，克服了人力物力上的许多困难。
