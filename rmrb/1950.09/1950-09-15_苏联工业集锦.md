　　Soviet Industry Highlights

　　Metal Rolling Fully Mechanized
　　The Soviet Union has achieved the world's first complete mechanization of metal rolling (including the process from heating steel ingots to finished product). Major Soviet metallurgical enterprises, such as the Hammer and Sickle Factory in Moscow, the Magnitogorsk Factory in the Urals, the Kuznetsk Factories, the Nizhny Tagil Factory, and the Zaporozhye Factory, have fully mechanized all steelmaking furnaces. In the past three and a half years, the use of the latest equipment in factories in the central and southern regions of the Soviet Union alone has enabled more than 4,500 workers to transfer to new jobs.

　　Rationalization Proposals Improve Metallurgy
　　Workers in Soviet metallurgical enterprises put forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals in the first half of this year. These proposals greatly helped to increase the productivity of metallurgical machinery and extend the life of open-hearth furnaces, blast furnaces, and rolling mills. As a result of the implementation of rationalization proposals, the efficiency of open-hearth furnaces nationwide is now 15 to 20 percent higher than it was two years ago. The implementation of innovative proposals in steel factories has resulted in savings of 40 percent this year compared to last year.

　　Mass Production of New Machine Tools
　　Soviet machine-building enterprises now produce approximately 2,000 types of machine tools, three-quarters of which were designed by Soviet experts in the post-war years. The "Red Proletarian" factory in Moscow recently manufactured a series of automatic machine tools, including a machine for manufacturing railway car parts. Its efficiency exceeds the maximum efficiency of similar machines manufactured in the United States by 20 percent. The Ordzhonikidze factory installed the Soviet Union's first set of automatic machine tools, capable of performing 134 operations automatically. Using this machine to manufacture tractor parts is 50 times faster than before.

　　Donbass Coal Mines Mechanized Coal Mining
　　In the Donbass, one of the Soviet Union's main coal mining areas, the entire coal mining process in many coalfields has been fully mechanized, and all coalfields have become veritable underground factories. Half of the coalfields in the country's largest Stalin Coal Mining Trust have adopted coal mining combines, which can simultaneously carry out coal cutting, loading, and transportation. Outstanding workers who manage these new machines have increased their monthly coal production to 15,000 tons.

　　The State Coal Mining Machine Design Institute of the Soviet Coal Industry Ministry has invented two new types of coal mining combines this year. One is used to mine narrow coal seams, and the other is used to mine edge coal seams. The experimental results are good, and mass production has now begun.

　　Using New Rock Drilling Machines to Mine Stone
　　Soviet engineer and Stalin Prize winner, Stoljarov, invented a powerful new rock drilling machine that completely mechanized the process of mining marble and other rocks. Managed by only one worker, the new machine increases the speed of the production process dozens of times. According to preliminary estimates, the use of this new machine will reduce the production cost of marble by 40 percent.

　　White Cloth Production Increases Sevenfold in Four Years
　　The Soviet textile industry has greatly increased the production of raw cotton fabrics. In the past four and a half years, white cloth production has increased sevenfold, and linen production has more than doubled. This year, cotton mills in Moscow, Ivanovo, Tashkent, and other places will produce hundreds of millions of meters of printed cloth alone, with 1,500 new patterns.

　　8 Billion Invested in Food Industry
　　The capital investment of the Soviet food industry in the new Five-Year Plan exceeds 8 billion rubles. In the first four years, approximately 700 factories have started production, and the production capacity of some major departments has exceeded pre-war levels. For example, sugar production has increased approximately ninefold, and canned food and confectionery have increased by more than two or three times respectively. In the past year and a half, the food industry has adopted more than 100 new types of highly efficient machinery and equipment, mechanizing laborious production processes in sugar refining, brewing, and other departments.

　　苏联工业集锦
    金属的辗制完全机械化
    苏联已实现了世界上第一次的金属辗制的完全机械化（包括从钢块加热到产品制成的程序）。苏联的重要冶金企业，如莫斯科的锤子与镰刀工厂，乌拉尔的马格尼托哥尔斯克工厂，库兹涅茨克各工厂，新塔吉尔工厂和萨坡罗什工厂的全部炼钢炉，已完全机械化。在过去三年半中，仅在苏联中部与南部地区的工厂里，就因使用最新设备，使四千五百多工人得以转移到新的工作上去。
    合理化建议改进冶金业
    苏联冶金企业的工人，今年上半年提出了数万件合理化建议，这些建议大大帮助了增加冶金机器的生产率，和延长马丁炉、鼓风炉与辗压工场的寿命。由于实行合理化建议，现在全国马丁炉的效率较两年前增高了百分之十五到二十。在钢铁工厂中实行革新建议的结果，使今年较去年节省了百分之四十的费用。
    大量制造新型工作母机
    苏联机器制造企业现在生产约二千种工作母机，其中有四分之三是苏联专家在战后数年内设计的。莫斯科的“红色无产者”工厂最近制造了一系列的自动母机，包括一种制造铁路车厢零件的机器。其效率超过美国制造的同类机器的最高效率的百分之二十。奥尔忠尼启则工厂装置了苏联第一套自动工作母机，能自动进行一百三十四种操作，以这种母机制造拖拉机零件，速率较前快五十倍。
    顿巴斯煤矿机械化采煤
    苏联主要煤矿区之一的顿巴斯，已有许多煤场的整个采煤过程全部机械化，一切煤场都已成为名副其实的地下工厂。全国最大的斯大林采煤托拉斯，已有半数的煤场采用了采煤联合机，可以同时进行凿煤、装煤和运煤的工作，管理这种新机器的优秀工人，已把每月的采煤量提高到一万五千吨。
    苏联煤业部所属国立采煤机器设计研究所，今年发明了两种新式采煤联合机。一种用来开采狭煤层，另一种用来开采边煤层。实验结果良好，现已开始大批制造。
    利用新凿石机开采石矿
    苏联工程师、斯大林奖金得奖人斯托利雅罗夫，发明了一种效力强大的新凿石机，使大理石矿及其他岩石的开采过程完全机械化。新机器只要一个工人管理，就会使生产过程的速度增加数十倍。据初步估计，使用这种新机器将使大理石的生产成本减少百分之四十。
    白布产量四年增了七倍
    苏联纺织工业大量增加了原棉织品的生产。四年半以来，白布增加到七倍，亚麻布增加到两倍以上。今年，莫斯科、伊凡诺佛、塔什干等地的棉织厂，单是印花布就要生产几万万公尺，新花样有一千五百种之多。
    食品工业投资额八十亿
    苏联食品工业在新五年计划中的资产投资额超出八十亿卢布。在头四年中，约有七百家工厂已开工生产，有些主要部门的生产能力已超过战前水平。例如，食糖产量约增加九倍，罐头食品和糖果分别增加了二倍或三倍以上。食品工业在过去一年半中，已采用了一百多种新式的具有高度效能的机器装备，使炼糖、酿酒和其他部门中费力的生产过程机械化。        【新华社】
