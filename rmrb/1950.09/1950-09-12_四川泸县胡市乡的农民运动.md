The Peasant Movement in Hushi Township, Luxian County, Sichuan
    Xiu Zhong, Hu Lin

This is an investigative piece about a typical township in Sichuan Province. Hushi Township is under the jurisdiction of the Seventh District of Luxian County, straddling both sides of the Tuo River. The riverbanks are lined with clumps of longan and tangerine trees, and the undulating terraced fields exude fragrant rice scents. In this township of 15,000 people, a small number of landlords occupy nearly 70% of the township's land area. The peasants suffer inhuman feudal exploitation and cannot get enough to eat despite their hard labor year after year. But in the half year since liberation, this township has been gradually changing its face.

Due to being under feudal rule for a long time, the peasants often had some concerns about their actions, but these concerns have now diminished. We can often see peasants at many meetings raising iron-like fists and saying: "Chairman Mao is sitting in Beijing, the world is settled! The peasants have a chance to stand up, and the muddy-legged people will slowly turn themselves over!"

The bandits in this township have been largely suppressed. Before the bandit suppression, there were 109 people in this township who were bandits, most of whom were forced to do so. Now 99 people have surrendered and turned themselves in, and there are still 10 people whose whereabouts are unknown. The peasants organized joint defense teams to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in suppressing bandits. Six or seventy of these 99 surrendered people were won back by the peasants. The reporter saw in the peasant joint defense team headquarters many young wives leading their husbands, and white-haired old farmers leading their sons joyfully coming to register for self-renewal. An old woman disguised her son as a girl and fled from the bandit camp at dusk.

During the grain requisition process in this township, under the leadership of the work team sent by the People's Government, peasant associations were established. Then, more than 1,000 peasant association members and the peasants of the entire township, in accordance with the laws of the People's Government, launched a struggle against concealing and underreporting, investigating undeclared land, and implementing reasonable burdens, which reduced the burdens of the peasants who had very little income and heavy burdens before liberation. Poor peasant Zhang Fatian, a family of six, rented five *shi* of land (each *shi* of land is equivalent to two and a half *mu* in the north). In the past, the burden each year accounted for 60% of his family's total income, but this year the burden only accounts for 5% of his income. Under the leadership of the peasant associations, the peasants uncovered more than 20,000 *shi* of undeclared land by the landlords. Some landlords who had always shifted their burdens in the past still attempted to have the peasants bear them. After making a detailed investigation, the peasants pointed out to them face to face at the evaluation meeting: "Isn't there dozens or hundreds of *shi* of yellow grain hidden in your false walls and dark rooms? In the past, you had a lot of land and little burden, but now you have to bear it fairly and reasonably!" The landlords' faces turned red, and their conspiracy to shift the burden failed, and they had to honestly pay the grain in accordance with the law.

Around the Dragon Boat Festival this year, many illegal acts of landlords seizing tenanted land occurred in the township. The peasants who lost their tenancy rights reported to the peasant associations. More than 1,000 members of the township's peasant association united with more than 10,000 peasants in the entire township to conduct an orderly struggle of reasoning with the landlords who unreasonably seized land. The peasant association convened meetings of landlords and tenants to reason and oppose land seizure. For example, a landlord named Guo Mingwu rented out 80 *shi* of land and took back 20 *shi* for "self-cultivation," and also took back the remaining 60 *shi* to hire three laborers to cultivate. He thought that in this way he could become a rich peasant and get away with it during rent reduction and land distribution. At the evaluation meeting, the peasants asked, "You have such a big belly, you even have to sit in a sedan chair to go out. How can you cultivate 20 *shi* of land?" The landlord said, "The government told us to learn to work!" The peasants said, "Babies who can't walk can't walk far. If you want to learn to work, we will give you less land to cultivate, and we will teach you!" The landlord was at a loss for words and had to agree. The anti-land seizure struggle was victorious throughout the township.

Through the struggles of bandit suppression, reasonable burden, and anti-land seizure, the peasants of Hushi Township have been initially organized. They unanimously demanded that the People's Government lead them in implementing rent reduction. From May to the end of July, the membership of the township's peasant association has grown from 1,100 to more than 3,000, and 300 people have been formed into peasant armed militia teams, composed of young and middle-aged members. At present, they are actively preparing for rent reduction, continuing to raise their class consciousness, and expanding the peasant association organization. After the autumn harvest, they will throw themselves into the movement against local tyrants and rent reduction.

　　四川泸县胡市乡的农民运动
    修忠　胡林
    这是四川省一个普通的乡的调查材料。胡市乡属泸县七区管辖，横跨沱江两岸。江畔长满了丛丛的桂圆和橘柑树，起伏的梯形田野里喷射着阵阵稻香。这个一万五千人口的乡里，少数地主却占有了全乡土地面积的将近百分之七十。农民们受着惨无人道的封建剥削，长年辛苦劳动，不得一饱。但在解放半年以来，这个乡已在逐渐地改变着自己的面貌。
    由于长期地处于封建统治之下，农民对自己的行动，往往是有些顾虑的，但是现在这种顾虑已经减少了。我们可以常常看到，在很多农民的会议上，农民们高举着铁一样的拳头说：“毛主席坐北京，天下定了！农民有了出头之日，慢慢地黄泥巴脚杆就要翻身！”
    这个乡的土匪已经大体肃清。在剿匪以前，这个乡当土匪的有一百零九人，其中绝大部分都是被强迫干的。现在投降自新的已有九十九人，还有十个人不知道下落。农民们组织了联防队配合解放军剿匪。这投诚自新的九十九人中有六、七十人就是被农民们争取回来的。记者在农民的联防队部里，看到不少年轻的妻子领着他们的丈夫，白发老农领着他们的儿子喜悦地前来登记自新。有一个老太婆叫她的儿子扮作姑娘，在黄昏时分从匪营里逃出来。
    这个乡的农民在征粮过程中，在人民政府派来的工作队领导下，建立了农民协会。接着一千多农民协会的会员和全乡农民，按照人民政府的法令展开了反瞒报、查黑田，实行合理负担的斗争，使解放以前收入极少而负担苛重的农民减轻了负担。贫农张发田，一家六口人，佃种五石田（每石田合北方二亩半），过去每年的负担占了他家全部收入的百分之六十，今年负担则只占其收入的百分之五。农民们在农民协会的领导下查出地主黑田二万余石。有些过去一贯转嫁负担的地主，仍企图让农民替他们负担。农民们作了详细的调查后，在评议会上当面向他们指出：“你们那夹壁墙里，那暗屋子里藏的不是成几十石、几百石的黄谷吗？你们过去地多负担少，现在要公平合理地负担了！”地主的脸红了，企图转嫁负担的阴谋失败了，只得老实地按照法令缴粮。
    今年端阳节前后，该乡曾发生过不少地主夺佃的非法行为。失去了佃权的农民，就到农民协会里报告。该乡农民协会一千多个会员，团结全乡一万多农民在一起，对无理夺佃的地主，进行了有秩序的说理斗争。农会召开地主和佃户会议评理，反对夺佃。例如，有一个地主郭明五出租八十石田，夺回了二十石“自耕”，其余的六十石也夺回另觅三个雇工耕种。他以为这样就可以变成一个富农，减租、分田时就可以混过去。在评理会上农民问：“你这样的大肚皮，连出出门也要坐滑竿，怎么能种得了二十石田呢？”地主说：“政府叫我们学习劳动呀！”农民说：“不会走路的娃儿不能走远路，你要想学劳动，给你少一些的田种，我们来教你！”地主理屈，只得答应。反夺佃斗争在全乡都胜利了。
    经过了剿匪、合理负担和反夺佃的斗争，胡市乡的农民已经初步组织起来了。他们一致要求人民政府领导他们实行减租。从五月到七月底，该乡农民协会的会员已由一千一百人发展到三千多人，并且由青壮年会员，组成了农民的武装基干队三百人。目前他们正在积极进行减租的准备工作，继续提高阶级觉悟，扩大农民协会组织。到秋后，他们就要投入反恶霸和减租运动中了。              【新华社讯】
