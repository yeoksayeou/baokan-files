Since Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Soviet representative to the United Nations Security Council Malik returned to the Security Council and legally assumed the chairmanship of the Security Council in August, he has made significant efforts and contributions to the global people's struggle against imperialist wars of aggression and in defense of world peace.

In this month, due to Malik's strong will to represent the Soviet Union and the people of the world in upholding human justice and defending peace, and as a result of persistent efforts in the Security Council, the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to manipulate the Security Council to expand the war of aggression has been severely hit. Thanks to Malik's persistent efforts, the Security Council meetings in August not only discussed the issue of the United States' armed aggression against Korea but also passed a resolution to include the issue of the Central People's Government of China's protest against the United States' armed aggression against our territory of Taiwan on the agenda. Although the Soviet Union's just struggle in the Security Council has encountered all kinds of obstruction and sabotage from the United States, and will continue to encounter many obstructions and sabotage, through this struggle, the people of the world can see more clearly the crimes of the United States in carrying out wars of aggression and undermining world peace, and more bravely persist in this just struggle. Therefore, in this month, the struggle of the world peace and democracy camp represented by the Soviet Union in the Security Council has been very successful and victorious; the imperialist bloc headed by the United States has suffered a serious defeat and blow.

Since the establishment of the Security Council in January 1946, the imperialist bloc headed by the United States has tried to turn the Security Council into a tool to facilitate imperialist aggression. After January of this year, U.S. imperialism even more brazenly violated the UN Charter, refusing to allow the representative of our country, who is the only legitimate representative of the Chinese people, to attend the UN and its Security Council, and refusing to expel the representatives of the illegal Kuomintang remnants, creating an illegal state of the Security Council, attempting to turn the Security Council into a convenient tool serving the aggression plans of the imperialist aggressor group. After the United States provoked the war of aggression against Korea, this sinister conspiracy was even more exposed. The United States has repeatedly manipulated the Security Council to hold illegal meetings and pass illegal resolutions, forcing UN member states to support U.S. aggression and participate in armed intervention in Korea. At the same time, the U.S. aggressors have expanded their scope of aggression, creating the crime of armed aggression against our country's territory, territorial waters, and airspace. However, the Soviet representative has loyally defended the UN Charter, defended the purposes and principles of the UN, and struck at all conspiracies of the imperialist bloc, exposing the criminal face of the U.S. aggressors. This has caused widespread panic in the imperialist bloc, especially causing the U.S. imperialists to fall into great anxiety and panic.

On the third day of Malik's chairmanship of the Security Council meeting, according to an August 4 dispatch from Washington by Agence France-Presse reporter Davidson, "After Malik put forward the proposal, the already high temperature in the U.S. government continued to rise. Despite the attempts of American diplomats to appear calm on the surface, they have shown a certain degree of unease." The degree of this American unease is increasing day by day. On August 23, the Kuomintang Central News Agency, a U.S. running dog, in its dispatch from Washington, had to admit that "the general public is increasingly concerned that the United States is losing the propaganda war in the Security Council." Obviously, the issue is not about "losing the propaganda war," but about the imperialists being defeated in the face of human justice.

The Soviet Union's persistence in the just struggle in the Security Council has won the warm support of the world's righteous people, and will prompt some people who have been deceived and coerced by U.S. imperialism to gradually wake up. Recently, people from all over the world have sent telegrams to the Security Council protesting against the U.S.'s armed aggression and atrocities, and supporting and endorsing the Soviet proposals. These include not only the broad masses of workers, peasants, students, youth, and women, but also many professors, scholars, experts, and representatives from various upper strata. This is closely integrated with the worldwide signature campaign to defend peace, and strongly supports Malik's just struggle in the Security Council. This shows that what Malik represents is truly the greatest majority of mankind; and the few votes that the U.S. aggressors are desperately manipulating in the Security Council are only a tiny minority.

The imperialist bloc, especially U.S. imperialism, is becoming more and more isolated. In diplomacy, apart from resorting to the most despicable and clumsy means to coerce certain countries, it has no more political capital to use. Take the Security Council meeting on August 29 as an example: when Chairman Malik's ruling had already taken effect in accordance with the law, U.S. representative Austin still rudely violated procedural rules, attempting to exert pressure on the Security Council members during the vote. This rogue behavior will only make it more isolated, and there will be no other result. The increasingly isolated position of the United States is irreversible, because the U.S. aggressors are enemies of the people of the world and enemies of the truth. Therefore, it will inevitably run out of arguments and fail miserably. The internal quarrels within U.S. imperialism have already increased sharply. This is similarly due to the development of internal contradictions in imperialism, which has been further promoted by the Soviet representative's persistence in the just struggle in the Security Council.

The U.S. government has been widely recognized as being "in a complete mess." This cannot even be concealed by the U.S. Information Service. An August 21 Washington dispatch from the Information Service revealed news from the New York Times that the U.S. government's foreign policy, especially its foreign policy in the Far East, has become the main point of contention in the recent U.S. elections. The newspaper reporter reported: "The Democrats blame the Korean incident on the lack of a bipartisan policy, which was caused by the Republicans. Republican leaders say the government has made a complete mess." "Public resentment towards foreign policy is growing. Because this foreign policy has put the United States in a dilemma in the Far East." Not only that, the U.S. government's aggressive policy has already brought increasingly deepening disasters to the American people. According to the Moody's price index in the United States, after the outbreak of the Korean War, prices in the U.S. domestic market soared, and the U.S. dollar depreciated rapidly. As of August 24, the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar had decreased by more than 20% compared to before the outbreak of the Korean War. The U.S. government is still actually carrying out plans to expand the war of aggression. U.S. Secretary of the Navy Matthews, in a speech in Boston on the evening of August 25, openly announced that he wanted to "start a war" and expressed that he would "accept the title of initiator of a war of aggression with peace of mind." On the same day, MacArthur's telegram to the U.S. Overseas Veterans Association openly advocated that Taiwan is the "linchpin" of the U.S.'s "defense line" in the Pacific. Although the Truman government hurriedly issued a statement denying Matthews' speech and ordered the cancellation of MacArthur's statement in order to cover up its war of aggression plans, the war intentions of the U.S. aggressors were exposed. And the U.S. government's panicked and hypocritical concealment of its war intentions also shows that the U.S. government is increasingly feeling the impact of the anti-aggression forces of the people of the world, and further demonstrates the increasingly isolated position of the United States.

In the face of the power and justice of the people of the whole world, the facts prove that the American paper tiger is not at all scary. As long as the people of the world become more aware and unite more closely, the war plans of the U.S. aggressors can be completely defeated. We, the Chinese people, sincerely admire the heroism of the Korean people in the war against aggression; we also admire and thank the Soviet Union for its just struggle against the aggressors in the Security Council. Our people will continue to work hard to support the just struggle in the Security Council. We fully support the speech of the Soviet representative at the Security Council meeting on August 29. We firmly demand that the United Nations immediately expel the illegal Kuomintang remnant bandits' representatives and immediately allow the only legal representative of our country to formally attend the United Nations and its Security Council and other institutions. We will never allow the United Nations and its Security Council to become a tool for U.S. aggressors to undermine world peace. We are willing to contribute everything we have to defend human justice and peace.

### 坚持在安理会的正义斗争

　　坚持在安理会的正义斗争
    苏联副外长、苏联驻联合国安全理事会代表马立克回到安理会，并依法担任八月份的安理会主席以来，对于全世界人民反对帝国主义的侵略战争、保卫世界和平的奋斗事业，已经做了重大的努力，作了重要的贡献。
    这一个月中，由于马立克代表苏联和世界人民维护人类正义与保卫和平的坚强意志，在安理会中坚持努力的结果，使美国帝国主义操纵安理会扩大侵略战争的阴谋遭到了严重的打击。由于马立克的坚持努力，八月份的安理会会议，不但讨论了美国武装侵略朝鲜的问题，并且通过了将我国中央人民政府抗议美国武装侵略我国领土台湾的问题列入议程。虽然，苏联在安理会中的正义的斗争，遇到了美国的百般阻挠与破坏，并且还会继续遇到许多阻挠与破坏；但是，通过这个斗争，全世界人民可以更清楚地看到美国进行侵略战争破坏世界和平的罪恶，而更加英勇地坚持这一正义的斗争。因此，这一个月中，苏联所代表的世界和平民主阵营，在安理会中的斗争是有很大成绩的，是胜利的；以美国为首的帝国主义集团则遭受了严重的失败和打击。
    自从安理会在一九四六年一月成立之时起，以美国为首的帝国主义集团，就曾力图把安理会变成便利于帝国主义进行侵略的工具。今年一月以后，美帝国主义更悍然违犯联合国宪章，拒绝唯一合法地代表中国人民的我国代表出席联合国及其安理会，拒绝开除非法的国民党残余匪帮的代表，造成了安理会的非法状态，企图使安理会变成为帝国主义侵略集团的侵略计划服役的如意工具。当美国挑起对朝鲜的侵略战争以后，这个罪恶阴谋更加暴露无遗。美国曾连续操纵安理会举行非法会议，通过非法的决议，强迫联合国各会员国支持美国的侵略行为，参加对朝鲜的武装干涉。与此同时，美国侵略者更扩大其侵略范围，造成了对我国领土、领海和领空的武装侵略的罪行。但是，苏联代表忠贞不渝地保卫联合国宪章，保卫联合国的宗旨和原则，打击了帝国主义集团的一切阴谋，揭露了美国侵略者的罪恶面目。这使帝国主义集团发生了普遍的惊慌，特别是使美帝国主义陷于极大的不安与慌乱。
    在马立克主持安理会会议的第三天，据法新社记者戴维逊八月四日发自华盛顿的电讯称，“在马立克提出提案之后，美国政府内原已很高的温度继续上升。尽管美国外交家们企图在外表上装作镇静的样子，他们已表现出一定程度的不安。”美国的这种不安程度是与日俱增的。八月二十三日，美国走狗国民党中央社在其发自华盛顿的电讯中，也不得不供认“一般人士日益关切美国在安理会宣传战中吃败仗”。很显然的，问题决不是什么“宣传战中吃败仗”，而是帝国主义者在人类的正义面前吃败仗。
    苏联在安理会中坚持正义的斗争，获得了全世界正义人民的热烈拥护，并将促使一些受了美帝国主义的欺骗与挟制的人们，日渐清醒。最近时期，世界各国人民都纷纷致电安理会抗议美国的武装侵略暴行；支持与拥护苏联的提案。其中不但包括了广大的工人、农民、学生、青年、妇女，而且包括了许多教授、学者、专门家以及各种上层代表人物。这和全世界人民保卫和平的签名运动密切地结合了起来，有力地支持了马立克在安理会中的正义斗争。这说明了马立克所代表的是真正的人类的最大多数；而美国侵略者在安理会中拚命操纵着的几张投票只不过是极少数而已。
    帝国主义集团，特别是美帝国主义是更加孤立了。它在外交上除了采取最卑鄙的拙劣的手段来挟制某些国家以外，再也没有可以运用的政治资本了。就以安理会八月二十九日的会议来说，当着主席马立克的裁决业已依法生效了的时候，美国代表奥斯汀仍然粗暴地违反程序规则，企图在表决时对安理会理事国使用压力。这种无赖的行径，只会使它更加陷于孤立，此外决不会有别的结果。美国地位的日益孤立是无可挽救的，因为美国侵略者与全世界人民为敌，与真理为敌，因此，它就必然会理竭辞穷、狼狈失败的。现在美帝国主义内部的争吵已经急剧地增多了。这同样是由于苏联代表在安理会中坚持正义的斗争所更加促进了的帝国主义内部矛盾的发展。
    美国政府已被公认是“搞得一团糟了”。这甚至于美国新闻处也不能掩饰了。该新闻处八月二十一日华盛顿电讯透露纽约时报的消息说，美国政府的外交政策，特别是远东方面的外交政策，成为最近美国大选中的主要争论点。该报记者报道：“民主党将朝鲜事件归咎于没有两党政策，而这情形是共和党造成的。共和党的领袖们说，政府已经搞得一团糟。”“民众对外交政策的愤懑情绪在日渐增涨中。因为这种外交政策使得美国在远东的局势中进退两难。”不但如此，美国政府的侵略政策已经给予美国人民带来了日益加深的灾难。按照美国莫迪氏物价指数，朝鲜战争爆发后，美国国内市场物价激涨，美金迅速贬值。截至八月二十四日，美金购买力已较朝鲜战争爆发前贬低百分之二十以上。美国政府还在实际进行扩大侵略战争的计划。美海军部长马休斯于八月二十五日晚在波士顿的演说，公开宣布要“发动战争”，并表示“心安理得地接受侵略战争发动者的称号”。同日，麦克阿瑟致美国海外退伍军人协会的电报，公然鼓吹台湾是美国在太平洋“防线”的“总枢纽”。虽然杜鲁门政府为了掩盖它的侵略战争计划，慌忙发表声明否认马休斯的演说，并下令撤消麦克阿瑟的声明；但是，美国侵略者的战争意图是欲盖弥彰了。而美国政府这样慌乱地虚伪掩饰它的战争意图，同时也表示了美国政府日益严重地感受着世界人民反侵略力量所给予的打击，更加表示了美国地位的日益孤立。
    在全世界人民的力量和正义的面前，事实证明美国纸老虎是决不可怕的。只要全世界人民更加觉悟起来，更加亲密地团结起来，美国侵略者的战争计划是完全可以被击破的。我们中国人民，衷心钦佩朝鲜人民在反侵略战争中的英雄气概；我们同样钦佩和感谢苏联在安理会中反对侵略者的正义斗争。我国人民将继续努力支持在安理会中的正义斗争。我们完全拥护苏联代表在八月二十九日安理会会议上的发言。我们坚决要求联合国立即开除非法的国民党残匪代表，立即允许唯一合法的我国代表正式出席联合国及其安理会和其他各机构。我们决不容许联合国及其安理会成为美国侵略者破坏世界和平的工具。我们愿为保卫人类的正义与和平而贡献我们的一切。
