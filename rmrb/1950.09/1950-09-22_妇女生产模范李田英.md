　　Women's Production Model Li Tianying
　　Liu Xianzhong, Li Zhaolin
　　An ordinary rural woman not only shoulders the production tasks of a family of eleven but also leads the production of the entire village, gradually moving towards a prosperous life. This is the simple reason why Li Tianying was selected as a labor model representative to attend the National Congress of Laborers, Peasants, and Soldiers. She is from Sanliushu Village, Third District, Guangrao, Shandong. After her husband joined the army in 1946, the production responsibility for a family of eleven fell on her shoulders.
　　Sanliushu Village has a total of forty-seven households, with two hundred and three people, and only one thousand two hundred and ninety-six mu of land. The village organized mutual aid teams as early as 1945. Due to her active promotion, by 1947, the entire village had been fully organized, and these mutual aid organizations are still very solid.
　　Li Tianying is a production expert. She joined the Communist Party of China in 1946. Under the leadership and education of the Party, she not only actively takes the lead in production but is also able to organize and promote the masses of the entire village to actively participate in the production movement. In the spring of 1949, the higher authorities called for "plowing one more piece of land, applying one more cart of manure, and harvesting ten percent more grain." She immediately mobilized women to go down the slopes to plow the land. She first came up with a method of jointly managing children, so all ten or so women in the group went to the fields. At the beginning of summer weeding, she specifically proposed that a woman's work point should be worth eight-tenths of a male work point (previously it was seven-tenths). After mobilization and careful accounting, 90 percent of the women in the village went to the fields to produce, and 37 women were organized to weed cotton in the low-lying areas, weeding 41 large mu of cotton in six days.
　　In the spring of 1949, it did not rain after the spring sowing, and all the spring seedlings died from drought. Li Tianying mobilized everyone to fight the drought, asking the masses to replant seeds and plant some sweet potatoes. The masses were not convinced, with some saying, "I've never heard of fighting the drought before, drought is the will of heaven." Others said, "Fighting the drought works where there is water, but it's difficult for us to even get drinking water here, how can we have water to irrigate the land?" But Li Tianying patiently educated everyone, saying, "Use river water if you're near a river, use bay water if you're near a bay, and if there's no river or bay, then plow the land a couple more times (meaning more plowing can resist drought)." At the same time, she explained that the income from one mu of sweet potatoes is better than that from two or three mu of crops. After repeated explanation and education, the masses were convinced. So she mobilized the entire group to plant three mu of crops near the river, and went to buy sweet potato seedlings, finally managing to plant the sweet potatoes after a lot of effort. Soon after, it rained heavily, and she immediately organized the masses to rush to plant, but unexpectedly it rained continuously, and the crops that were planted were flooded again. So she led the drainage efforts and replanted one hundred mu of radishes.
　　During the wheat harvest last year, the village had few livestock and not enough to use. In order to ensure timely planting, she mobilized the women in her group to carry out autumn planting, with six people pulling the seed drill and four people delivering manure. They planted twelve mu and eight fen of wheat in four days, and the entire group quickly finished planting seventy-six mu of wheat. This year, the government called for planting more cotton. At first, the masses were unwilling to plant, so she used the practical examples of the benefits of planting cotton last year to educate everyone, and as a result, the entire village planted one hundred and fifty mu of Si-zi cotton this year.
　　Li Tianying is also an expert in sideline production. When the Yellow River was being repaired in the spring of 1946, half of the village's twenty-six male laborers went to work on it, and one male laborer had to be responsible for fetching water every day. This was the best time to dry salt, but there were only twelve male laborers left in the village, and they were already too busy, so how could they dry salt? The masses were all worried about not having a solution. If the salt was not dried well this season, the entire village's livelihood would be affected. At this time, Li Tianying mobilized the women to dry salt. She first mobilized the military dependents Zhou Junying and Sun Peirong, and then mobilized eight more women. Including herself, there were nine people, divided into three groups. At the villagers' meeting the next day, they discussed how to dry salt and challenged the men. After the meeting, some of the women were still shy, so Li Tianying took off her shoes, rolled up her trouser legs, and went down to the beach with a manure basket on her back. On the beach, she helped the women divide the work, and then started carrying salt herself (more than a hundred jin each time). She carried it forty-nine times in one morning. In the afternoon, the women pulled buckets to draw water, with the men pulling the double ropes and the women pulling the single ropes. This solved the difficulty of no one drying salt due to a lack of male labor. Therefore, not only did it solve the village's livelihood difficulties, but it also changed the old viewpoint of men's consistent discrimination against women.
　　Due to last year's droughts, floods, insects, and hail disasters, the harvest was not good, so Li Tianying led the women to actively prepare for famine. Fifty-one of the village's sixty-one women were organized to collect yellow alfalfa seeds, collecting four hundred and sixty pockets in six days; and incidentally picked up dry firewood and pulled green vegetables along the way, drying one thousand two hundred jin of dried vegetables. After returning home, she mobilized the women to cut thorny branches, but because this was a difficult task, many women were unwilling to go. Li Tianying suggested that the women at home should earn eight-tenths of a work point per day, and those cutting thorny branches should earn nine-tenths of a work point. Although she had a two-month-old child, she still took the lead in cutting thorny branches. Due to her exemplary actions, twelve women in the group immediately went down to the low-lying areas, and six male laborers helped tie and transport them, cutting more than thirty carts of thorny branches in four and a half days, exchanging them for more than six thousand three hundred jin of grain. Although there were serious disasters of various kinds last year, thanks to her leadership and promotion, the village's harvest had surplus grain besides food and use.
　　Under Li Tianying's leadership and promotion, the masses of the entire village actively participated in various productions, and therefore gradually improved their lives. Before Sanliushu Village was organized, it was generally poor because the village had little land and many people, and everyone ate grass seeds (Artemisia seeds, etc.), and very few ate clean grain. Since Li Tianying led joint production in 1946, the entire village has gradually embarked on the road to prosperity. For example, Sun Xuelian, the most difficult household in the village, had a family of eight, with only three fen of land. The annual harvest could not maintain the minimum living standards, and everyone was hungry and emaciated. His uncle died of starvation, and his wife begged for food outside due to hunger; but since he participated in joint production, his life has gradually improved. He now feeds a mule, and has bought a large cart with others, and has built three new houses, and is now planning to buy another livestock to participate in the autumn harvest and autumn planting work.
　　Li Tianying actively leads the masses in production, and her status at home has also improved. When she got married at the age of seventeen, her family could not even afford to make her a new quilt. When she arrived at her in-laws' house, her husband and mother-in-law disliked her big feet, and often beat and scolded her, pointing at her and saying, "You are only fit for herding cattle and fetching water," scaring her so much that she was timid all day long and didn't even dare to speak. But since she joined the Party in 1946, under the education and leadership of the Party, and after actively participating in labor, she has become very different from the past. She is now the propaganda committee member of the village Party branch and the village women's president. Her father-in-law said, "What would our family eat without her?" Her mother-in-law also treats her like a daughter, and her husband constantly writes to her to help her make progress. Now the whole family is happily living a prosperous and harmonious life.

　　妇女生产模范李田英
    刘献忠·李兆麟
    一个普通的农村妇女，不但担负起了全家十一口人的生产任务；而且还领导了全村的生产，日渐走上生活富裕的道路。这就是李田英被选为出席全国工农兵英模大会的劳模代表的简单理由。她是山东广饶三区三柳树村的人，一九四六年，丈夫参军后，一家十一口的生产责任就落在了她的肩上。
    三柳树村共四十七户，二百零三口人，只有一千二百九十六亩土地。村里自一九四五年就组织起了插伙组，由于她积极的推动，到一九四七年，全村已全部组织起来了，这些互助组织现在还是很巩固的。
    李田英是个生产能手，一九四六年加入中国共产党，在党的领导和教育下，不但自己积极带头生产，而且能够组织推动全村群众积极投入生产运动。一九四九年春天，上级号召“多锄一片地，多上一车粪，多打一成粮”。她立即动员妇女下坡锄地，她首先研究出了小孩共管的办法，因此全组十余个妇女全下了地。夏锄开始时她特提出：妇女一个工应顶八分工（过去是七分工），经过动员与算细账后，全村百分之九十的妇女都下地生产，并组织了三十七个妇女下洼锄地，六天锄棉四十一大亩。
    一九四九年春种后天不下雨，春苗全部旱死，李田英又动员大家抗旱，让群众点种并再种些地瓜，群众思想搞不通，有的说：“从来就没有听见说过抗旱，旱是天意。”又有的说：“抗旱有水的地方行，咱这里吃水都困难，那有水浇地？”但李田英始终很耐心的教育大家说：“靠河用河水，靠湾用湾水，无河无湾就多锄两遍地（意思是多锄可以抗旱）。”同时又说明种地瓜一亩比二、三亩庄稼的收入都好。经过反复的说明教育，群众思想搞通了。于是他一面动员全组在靠河处种了三亩庄稼，一面去买地瓜秧子，费了许多工夫终于把地瓜种上了。不久天下大雨，她立即组织群众抢种，不料阴雨连绵，种的庄稼又被水涝了，于是她又领导排水，并抢种了百亩萝卜。
    去年麦收时，村里牲口少，不够用，为了耕种及时，她动员本组妇女进行秋种，六个人拉耧，四个人送粪，四天时间就种了十二亩八分麦子，全组七十六亩麦子也很快种完。今年政府号召多种棉。起初群众不愿种，她便用去年种棉好处的实际例子教育大家，结果今年全村种了一百五十亩斯字棉。
    副业生产李田英也是一把能手。一九四六年黄河春修的时候，全村二十六个男劳动力就去了一半，每天还要一个男劳动力负责拉水。这时正是晒盐最好时候，但家里只剩了十二个男劳力，本来就忙不过来，那能去晒盐呢？群众都愁没办法，如果这季盐晒不好，全村的生活就会发生困难。这时李田英就动员妇女晒盐。她首先动员好了军属周俊英、孙培荣两人，后来又动员了八个妇女，连自己九人，分成三组，在第二天村民大会上就研究如何晒盐，并同男子挑战。会后下滩时，有的妇女还害羞，李田英即首先脱了鞋子撩起裤腿，背上粪篮子下了滩。在滩上她帮妇女们分工后，自己就开始抬盐（每次百余斤）一上午她抬了四十九趟。下午妇女们即拉斗子打水，男的拉双绳女的拉单绳。这样便解决了缺乏男劳力无人晒盐的困难。因此不但解决了村里生活上的困难，并且转变了男子对妇女一向歧视的旧观点。
    由于去年的旱、涝、虫、雹等灾害，收成不好，李田英就领导妇女积极备荒。全村六十一个妇女，组织了五十一个人去打黄蓿菜种子，六天打了四百六十口袋；并附带在路上拾干柴、拔青菜，光晒干菜即晒了一千二百斤。回家后又动员妇女去割荆条，但因这是一个艰苦工作，好些妇女都不愿去。李田英又提议：在家的妇女一天活顶八分工；割荆条的顶九分工。她自己虽有两个月的小孩，但仍带头割荆条。由于她的模范行动，全组立即有十二个妇女下洼，另有六个男劳力帮助捆和运，四天半就割了三十多车荆条，换了六千三百多斤粮。去年虽有严重的各种灾害，但由于她的领导和推动，全村的收成，除吃用外尚有余粮。
    在李田英的领导和推动下，全村群众积极的参加了各种生产，因此也逐渐改善了生活。三柳树村在没有组织起来以前，因全村地少人多，普遍穷困，家家都吃草种子（黄蒿种子等），吃净粮的很少。自从一九四六年李田英领导插伙生产以后，全村便渐渐走上了生活富裕的道路。如村里最困难户孙学廉，全家八口人，只有三分地，每年的收获不能维持最低生活，个个饿的面黄饥瘦，他的伯父就是饿死的，老婆也因饥饿在外要饭；但自从他参加插伙生产以后，生活便逐渐好了起来，现在喂了一个骡子，还和别人合买了一辆大车，并盖了三间新房，现在还打算再买个牲口参加秋收秋种工作。
    李田英积极领导群众生产，在家里的地位也提高了。她十七岁出嫁的时候，娘家连床新被都给他作不起。到了婆家、丈夫、婆婆嫌她脚大，经常打骂她，指着她说：“你就是放牛、打水的角色”，吓的她整天缩手缩脚的，连话也不敢说。但是自从她一九四六年入党后，在党的教育和领导下。积极参加劳动以后，便与过去大不相同了，她现在是村党支部宣传委员和村妇女会长。她的公公说：“不是她，咱全家吃啥？”婆婆也把她当闺女待了，丈夫也不断给她来信帮助她进步。现在全家愉快的过着富裕、和睦的日子。
