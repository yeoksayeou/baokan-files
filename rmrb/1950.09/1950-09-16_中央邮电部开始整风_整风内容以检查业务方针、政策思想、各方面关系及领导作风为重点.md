　　Central Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Begins Rectification Campaign
    Rectification Focuses on Reviewing Business Guidelines, Policy Ideology, All Aspects of Relationships, and Leadership Style

    [Reported by this newspaper] The rectification campaign of the Central People's Government Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications is scheduled to take place in September and October. All cadres and party members will participate, with a focus on party members at the level of section chief and above. Through methods of criticism and self-criticism, and by widely soliciting opinions from the masses, the work of leading cadres and party members at all levels will be reviewed. The ministry held both a party member meeting and an all-staff meeting on the 2nd and 4th of this month to mobilize and arrange the rectification, and to stipulate the documents for study, beginning the rectification process. The rectification will focus on reviewing business guidelines, policy ideology, all aspects of relationships, and leadership style.

    Regarding business guidelines, the main focus will be on reviewing the ministry's service guidelines and service attitude through various business operations, namely, the question of whom to serve and how to serve. Policy ideology mainly involves reviewing whether postal and telecommunications fees take into account the relationship between public and private interests, whether the united front policy can effectively unite and cooperate with non-Party members, and also reviewing the organizational principles of postal and telecommunications institutions, such as the issue of separating and then combining postal and telecommunications institutions. Regarding relationships with various parties, the main focus will be on reviewing the relationship with local authorities and the relationship with the trade union after the unified and centralized leadership of postal and telecommunications. Leadership style will mainly focus on reviewing bureaucratic practices in leadership.

    The review method will mainly focus on issues, linking them to individuals. First, a broad review and discussion of work will be launched, raising problems and offering opinions. Then, the focus will be on major issues for in-depth discussion and review, in order to achieve a unified understanding, clarify thinking, and determine future policies and guidelines for the operation and management of postal and telecommunications services, as well as improve various relationships and working styles.
