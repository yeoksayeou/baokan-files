　　Northeast State-Owned Industries Major Products
    Mostly Failed to Meet August Targets
    Relaxing Leadership Is the Main Reason for Failing to Complete Tasks
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Comprehensive Statistics Office of the Planning Department of the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government: According to the daily reports of major products, in August, among the 34 major products of state-owned industries in Northeast China, 12 types were completed and exceeded the plan, while nearly two-thirds failed to complete the tasks. Among the products that exceeded the plan, ball bearings exceeded the task by the largest amount, completing 144.1 percent, followed by boilers exceeding the plan by 43.8 percent, and then by flat glass exceeding the plan by 35.5 percent.
    The third quarter is the season that determines whether the annual plan can be completed. However, two months have passed in the third quarter, and the completion of tasks has been very poor, which should arouse serious attention from the units that have not completed the tasks. The reasons, apart from eight major products, such as open-hearth steel ingots and coke produced by Anshan Iron and Steel, open-hearth steel ingots produced by the Machinery Bureau, transmission belts, conveyor belts, V-belts, pedicab inner tubes, and pedicab outer tires produced by the Light Industry Bureau, etc., which were not completed due to repairs approved by the ministry and reduced coal production as decided by the state, the main reason is the leadership did not keep a close grip. In particular, not a single rock drill produced by the Machinery Bureau was completed in July and August. The leadership of each unit should immediately come up with remedial measures, otherwise it will affect the completion of the annual plan.
    In terms of attendance rate, the plan was also not completed. The total average index even decreased by 1.5 percent compared with the previous month. The average index this month only reached 91.6 percent. In particular, the two units of Benxi and the Coal Mine Bureau, the former only reached 87.9 percent, and the latter reached 88.8 percent, which should also be noted.

　　东北国营工业主要产品
    八月份大部未完成任务
    放松领导是完不成任务的主要原因
    【本报讯】东北人民政府工业部计划处综合统计室报道：根据主要产品日报，八月份东北国营工业主要产品三十四种中有十二种完成并超过计划，将近三分之二未完成任务。超过计划的产品中，以滚珠轴承超过任务最多，完成百分之一四四·一，其次为锅炉超过计划百分之四三·八，再其次为平板玻璃超过计划百分之三五·五。
    第三季是决定一年计划能否完成的一季。但第三季已过两个月，而在完成任务上却都很差，这应引起未完成任务的各单位加以严重注意。究其原因，除八种主要产品，如鞍钢所产平炉钢锭、焦炭，机械局所产平炉钢锭，轻工局所产传动带、运输带、三角带、力车内胎、力车外胎等，因由部批准检修及原煤因国家决定减产而未完成计划外，其主要原因为领导上没有抓紧。特别是机械局所产凿岩机，七、八两月份竟一台也未完成。各单位领导上应即想出补救办法，否则将影响全年计划的完成。
    在出勤率方面，亦未完成计划，总平均指数竟比上月降低百分之一·五，本月平均指数仅达到百分之九一·六，特别是本溪与煤矿局二单位，前者只达百分之八七·九，后者达百分之八八·八，对此亦应引起注意。
