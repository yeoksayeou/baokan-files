　　Shanghai Rectification Campaign Gradually Unfolds

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai municipal-level rectification campaign has gradually unfolded since August 5th. The rectification method is mainly on-the-job rectification, centered on rectification meetings, combined with work inspections, listening to mass criticism, and improving work. However, the first phase focuses on training courses to cultivate rectification backbones and gain rectification experience from this. Currently, 367 leading cadres of party members from various systems have been gathered for study. On-the-job cadres have also begun studying documents. Several urgent problems have been discovered during the study: First, the rectification plans of some departments appear generalized, without specific requirements and priorities tailored to the different work, ideological, and organizational situations of each department. Second, some cadres have a waiting mentality, namely, "waiting for the cadres from the training courses to return" and "waiting for the higher-level reports to be made." Third, the rectification leadership organizations in some units have not truly played their role, lacking a strong leadership core. At the same time, the Municipal Rectification Committee's understanding of and assistance to the various sub-committees is also insufficient. For this reason, the Municipal Rectification Committee has decided that, in addition to conducting training courses as planned, it will strengthen the leadership of rectification organizations at all levels and continue to deepen mobilization. The city-wide rectification campaign is now gradually unfolding according to the above arrangements.

　　沪市整风运动逐步展开
    【本报讯】上海市级整风运动已于八月五日起逐步展开。整风方式是以在职整风为主，并以整风会议为中心，联系检查工作，与听取群众批评，改进工作。但第一期则以轮训班为重点，以便培养整风骨干和由此取得整风经验。现已集中各系统党员负责干部三百六十七人进行学习。在职干部亦已开始学习文件。现已在学习中发现几个急待解决的问题：一、某些部门的整风计划表现一般化，没有针对各部门不同的工作情况、思想情况和组织情况，提出各种不同的要求和重点。二、部分干部存在着等待思想，即“等轮训班干部回来”，“等上级做了报告再说”。三、某些单位的整风领导组织，未真正发挥作用，缺乏坚强的领导核心。同时，市整风委员会对各分会的了解与帮助也不够。为此，市整风委员会决定目前除按计划进行轮训外，并加强各级整风组织领导，继续深入动员。现全市整风运动正按上述部署逐渐展开。
