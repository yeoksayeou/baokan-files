　　Farmers in Shanghai Suburbs Celebrate National Day with Bumper Harvest
    Will Carry a Forty-Two-Pound Pumpkin in the Parade
    [Report from this Newspaper] According to the Shanghai Xinwen Ribao (Shanghai News Daily), farmers in the Shanghai suburbs, celebrating the first National Day, have also reaped a bumper harvest unseen in years. Overjoyed, farmers in various districts are preparing to celebrate National Day enthusiastically in various ways. When farmers in Yanjiawa Village, Xinmin Township, Xinshi District, held a forum to discuss how to celebrate the parade, Yu Laichuan said: "My field produced a big pumpkin weighing forty-two pounds (ordinary pumpkins weigh about ten pounds). I plan to carry it out during the parade to show everyone the results of our production." Inspired by his words, Xing Jingshan added: "My field produced a double eggplant, and I also plan to take it to the parade." Liu Hechang said: "I also have a rice ear with two hundred and forty-three grains of rice, which can also be taken to the parade for exhibition." The women said: "During the parade, we plan to carry the soles of military shoes we sewed on our backs to show the determination of our women to support the front lines." They also plan to write a letter to Chairman Mao, wishing him good health and thanking the People's Government for its leadership in production.
    The farmers in Gaoqiao District are even happier. They remember that on this day last year, due to the typhoon and tidal surge, the dilapidated seawall left by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was breached, turning Gaoqiao District into a swamp. The people suffered heavy property losses, and some even lost their lives. Fortunately, the People's Government mobilized manpower and resources to carry out large-scale repairs. In just one year, this tens of miles long "Great Wall" on the sea, the seawall, has been completed. Since then, their lives and property have been protected. Therefore, this year's National Day makes them feel even more love for the People's Government, and the meaning of celebrating National Day is even deeper.
    Farmers in Jiangwan and Wusong districts decided to respond to the government's call to promote thrift as a way to celebrate. In Jin Shen Village, Datong Township, Jiangwan District, all ninety-two households in the village used to buy a joss stick holder, a bundle of yuanbao (ingots made of paper), and a pair of candles for the Mid-Autumn Festival. This year, in order to improve autumn planting and for long-term interests, almost all of them no longer buy superstitious items, saving a total of 1,984,000 yuan. The farmers in Wusong District are using the fruits of their labor as capital for expanded reproduction or to repair their houses. For example, the houses in villages such as Yangjiazhai were demolished by the bandit army to build bunkers before liberation. The farmers built simple thatched huts under extreme difficulties. Now that the situation has improved, they are all being rebuilt to welcome National Day.
    The Farmers' Associations in Longhua, Xinjing, and other districts will hold farmers' forums to summarize the production achievements of the past year and launch cultural and recreational activities and large-scale parades on National Day to celebrate.

　　沪郊农民欣逢国庆又获丰收
    将抬出四十二斤的大南瓜参加游行
    【本报讯】据上海新闻日报消息：上海郊区农民于欣逢首届国庆节时，又获数年稀有的大丰收，各区农民于喜上加喜中，正准备用各种方式热烈庆祝国庆节。新市区新民乡颜家洼村农民开座谈会讨论庆祝游行办法时，俞来川说：“我家田里生了个大南瓜，重四十二斤（普通的南瓜约十斤左右重），游行时准备抬出来，让大家看看我伲生产的成绩”。在座的农民们受了他的启发，邢景山接着说：“我家田里生了个双生的大茄子，也准备拿去游行。”刘和昌说：“我家还留着一株生了二百四十三粒谷的稻穗，也可拿出游行展览了；”妇女们却说：“游行时，准备把缝制的军鞋底背在身上，表示我伲妇女界支援前线的决心。”他们还准备写信给毛主席，祝颂他老人家身体健康，并感谢人民政府领导生产的恩情。
    高桥区的农民更高兴了，他们记得去年今日，因台风海潮的侵袭，冲破了蒋匪帮遗留下来的残破海塘，弄得高桥区几成泽国，人民财产损失浩大，有的更是家破人亡，幸经人民政府发动人力、调剂物力，大规模修筑，短短一年时间，已完成了这绵亘数十华里的江海长城——海塘，从此他们的生命财产有了保障，所以今年的国庆节，他们更感到对人民政府的热爱，庆祝国庆的意义更深长了。
    江湾和吴淞两区的农民，决定响应政府号召，提倡节约来表示庆祝：江湾区大同乡金沈村，全村九十二户，他们过去每遇中秋节，每户要买一只香斗，一捆元宝，一对蜡烛，今年大家为搞好秋种，打算长远利益，几乎全部不再买迷信用品，全村共节约人民币一百九十八万四千元。吴淞区的农民，都将劳动的果实，作为扩大再生产的资本，或去修理房屋，像杨家宅等村的房屋，解放前均被匪军拆去做碉堡，农民在极度困难下，搭了简单的茅屋，现在情况比较好转了，都在修建起来，准备迎接国庆节。
    龙华、新泾等区农会，均将分别召开农民座谈会，总结一年来的生产成绩，并于国庆节展开文娱活动，发动大规模游行，以示庆祝。
