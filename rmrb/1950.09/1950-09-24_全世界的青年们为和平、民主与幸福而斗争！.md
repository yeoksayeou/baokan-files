The Youth of the World Fight for Peace, Democracy and Happiness!
A comprehensive report from our newspaper

“We swear: We will remember the unity forged in November 1945; not just this day, this week, or this year, but forever, until we have built the world we long for and fight for. We swear: We will build the unity of the youth of the world, regardless of race, color, nationality, or religious belief. We swear: We will eliminate all vestiges of fascism on Earth and establish loyal friendship among the people of the world. We swear: We will maintain a just and lasting peace, eliminate exploitation and poverty, and ensure that everyone has work. We are here to strengthen the unity of the youth of the world, to pay tribute to our fallen comrades, and to swear not to waste our skillful hands, intelligent minds, and youthful enthusiasm in war. Forward to our future!” Since the representatives of hundreds of millions of young people from all countries raised their arms and made the above oath at the World Youth Congress in London five years ago, the slogan "Youth unite, move towards lasting peace, democracy, national independence and a bright future!" has spread throughout the world, becoming the goal of the struggle of young people around the world. Young people in various countries, in different environments, are moving towards the same goal. This great world-scale struggle will not cease until the final victory.

Soviet Youth – the Banner of Victory for Democratic Youth of the World

The glorious Soviet youth is the banner of victory for the democratic youth of the world, and always stands at the forefront of the democratic youth of the world. They fight selflessly for their socialist motherland, and at the same time fight indomitably for peace, democracy, freedom, and national independence. It is no accident that they have become a model for young people all over the world.

During the years of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet youth, together with all the Soviet people, participated in the struggle against the fascist aggressors and defended their socialist motherland. Now, in the years of peaceful construction, they are working selflessly with great enthusiasm for the victory of the great cause of Lenin and Stalin – the cause of communism. In the industrial sector, Soviet youth not only actively participate in socialist emulation and strive to improve productivity, but are also the initiators and implementers of the socialist economy movement. They use all domestic scientific and technological discoveries and inventions to improve their production technology. In the agricultural sector, Soviet youth have made great contributions to the restoration and development of agricultural production, and their active labor has created unprecedentedly abundant harvests. New achievements contributed by Soviet youth are also constantly emerging in the fields of science, literature, and art.

Under the education of the Party of Lenin and Stalin, Soviet youth have a strong spirit of patriotism and a great spirit of internationalism. Soviet youth have demonstrated a high degree of international solidarity and friendship, playing a major leading role in the world youth movement. Thanks to the efforts of Soviet youth to promote the unity of the world's democratic youth, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which truly represents the interests of youth and fights for the interests of youth, was born; at the same time, thanks to the active role played by Soviet youth in it, the World Federation of Democratic Youth is able to grasp the correct struggle policy, strengthen unity and carry out activities victoriously. The Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee maintains close contact with more than 200 youth groups in more than 70 countries, and also plays a major role in the unity of the world's democratic youth.

Soviet youth are the strongest fighters in the movement to defend world peace. They responded to the call of the World Federation of Youth and participated in the Stockholm Peace Appeal signing movement with the greatest labor enthusiasm and political enthusiasm. Countless young Stakhanovites, young labor heroes and other outstanding young men and women have unanimously expressed their willingness to strengthen the fortress of world peace—the Soviet motherland and the strength of Stalin's peace policy, and to support the struggle of the people and youth of all countries against imperialist aggression with greater achievements in participating in communist construction.

The glorious name of the Pioneer League of the Soviet Union, the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League, has become a symbol of the unity, struggle, victory, and happiness of young people all over the world.

Youth of People's Democratic Countries Fight for Socialist Construction

The youth of the people's democratic countries of Southeast Europe, who had fought heroically against the fascist enemy for the liberation and freedom of their motherland, are now participating in the economic construction of their motherland with incomparable enthusiasm and confidence under the leadership of progressive youth organizations. Collective labor, shock movements, and production competitions have become an important part of the activities of young people in people's democratic countries, and they have already made brilliant achievements in this regard.

In the two years from 1948 to 1949, more than 400,000 young people in Bulgaria participated in construction teams and shock brigades, and they completed major projects such as the Hemus Mountains Highway running through the north and south of Bulgaria and the largest Rositza Dam in the country. Since the summer of 1948, Bulgarian youth have been building the modern Dimitrovgrad in sparsely populated towns. Between 1947 and 1948, Bulgarian youth construction teams increased the country's production value by 2.1 billion leva (including various construction projects) and saved the country 700 million leva in expenses.

In 1947 and 1948, the Czechoslovak youth, in coordination with the government's two-year plan, launched the "Youth Plan" movement. Members of the Czech Youth League built 231 houses and two highways for miners in Most and Livinov, and rebuilt the village of Lidice, which had been razed to the ground by the German invaders. During the autumn harvest in 1949, a large number of Czech students participated in labor to help farmers harvest, and the total working hours of voluntary labor in two months was 12 million hours. There are now nearly 150,000 young people in Czechoslovakia participating in the socialist competition and shock brigade movement.

Polish youth played a major role in the reconstruction of Warsaw, which had been almost completely destroyed by the fascist German invaders. Tens of thousands of young people organized hundreds of "service work teams" to build Warsaw's roads and build high-rise buildings, restoring Warsaw to its magnificent pre-war appearance in a short period of time.

After liberation, the Romanian youth construction team laid 51 kilometers of biogas pipes, 37 kilometers of gas pipes, and built the 61-kilometer Salva-Viseu railway, and 3,359 youth construction teams built 54 kilometers of embankments and established the largest carriage repair factory in Southeast Europe in Craiova. 200,000 young people participated in these construction projects.

Hungary has 900 youth production groups, 500 construction teams, and 40,000 individual competitors. Under the leadership of the Hungarian League of Working Youth, Hungarian youth are fighting for their better life.

Under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Youth League, Albanian youth plunged into the upsurge of building their motherland after liberation. In 1946, 4,000 young people completed a 65-kilometer highway. The construction of the first railway in Albanian history was also completed by 60,000 Albanian youth.

After experiencing the suffering of the war, German youth found a path to democracy, freedom, and happiness after the Soviet army defeated Hitler's fascism. Since the establishment of the Free German Youth League in 1946, the democratic youth movement in Germany has greatly developed. Hundreds of thousands of German youth are participating in labor competitions and working hard to restore the German national economy destroyed by the war. However, in West Germany, which is under the brutal rule of American and British imperialists, young people still live in hunger and poverty. The All-German Youth Congress held in Berlin at the end of May this year was a manifestation of the strong will of the entire young generation in Germany to strive for peace and democratic reunification of Germany.

Asian Youth Fight for National Liberation

Asian youth shoulder important and arduous tasks in the national liberation movements of various colonial and semi-colonial countries in the East. They have regarded their struggle for national independence and freedom as part of the struggle to defend world peace. The great victory of the Chinese people has greatly strengthened their confidence in victory, and they are drawing on the rich revolutionary experience of the Chinese people to carry out heroic and unyielding struggles to accelerate the arrival of victory.

Korean youth are now standing at the forefront of the anti-imperialist struggle. Under the leadership of the Korean Democratic Youth League, the vast number of Korean youth are carrying out heroic and arduous battles on the land of their motherland. Tens of thousands of young soldiers fighting against the American aggressors on the front lines have continuously achieved brilliant results, and young people in the rear are enthusiastically joining the army in an endless stream. In factories and in the countryside, young men and women are working at their posts to support the front lines. More than 20,000 people have formed "front-line work teams" to ensure the completion of the task of stepping up production. In addition, the "repair squads" organized by the youth are fighting hard against the crazy destruction of enemy aircraft.

Vietnamese youth have made great contributions to the national liberation struggle. Now, under the leadership of the Vietnam Youth League and other progressive youth organizations, they have responded to the government's call to prepare for a general counter-offensive, and are stepping up their efforts to participate in and support the war to defeat the American and French aggressors. Young people across Vietnam have enthusiastically launched an army recruitment movement. In the first half of this year alone, the Third War Zone in North Vietnam had 10,000 young people joining the Vietnam Liberation Army and guerrillas. Young people in other production posts are also increasing production with selfless labor to support the front lines and strive for victory.

Malayan youth have always been the vanguard of the struggle against British colonial rule. At present, Malayan youth are enthusiastically participating in the People's Liberation Army led by the Malayan Communist Party and are engaged in a resolute battle with the British colony.

Japanese progressive youth, united around the Japanese Communist Party, are fighting against the illegal actions of American imperialism to turn Japan into a colony and an aggressive base. In May of this year, the Japanese youth's anti-imperialist struggle reached a new climax. After the US imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea, Japanese youth, under difficult circumstances, rose up in unison and took strong struggle actions to oppose the US imperialism using Japan as an aggressive outpost.

The youth movements in India, Indonesia, Myanmar and other countries are also expanding day by day. Progressive youth organizations in various countries have united the vast number of young people to carry out struggles. In particular, they have demonstrated powerful strength in the recent peace signing movement.

Youth in Capitalist Countries Firmly Oppose the Conspiracies of War Merchants

The youth in capitalist countries, regardless of the reactionary rulers' suppression of progressive activities, are increasingly united around progressive and democratic youth organizations and are fighting for their own economic interests and democratic rights. They have further realized that the struggle to win their own rights is inseparable from the struggle for peace. They actively participated in the movement to defend world peace.

The American Progressive Youth Association and the Labor Youth League, the British Communist Youth League and the International Youth Association, the French Republican Youth League, the Italian Communist Youth League and the Youth League, the Dutch Youth League, the Australian Eureka Youth League and the Victorian Democratic Youth Association, the Canadian National Labor Youth League, etc., are all leading the progressive youth of various countries in unyielding struggles to oppose the imperialists' conspiracies to prepare for a new war, to strive for democratic rights and a happy life, and to strive for people's democracy and lasting peace. Young people in France, Italy, Britain, Denmark and other countries have continuously held demonstrations, refused to unload war materials, and opposed colonial wars. The young dockworkers in Nice bravely pushed the American-made tanks and artillery into the sea, the young soldiers in Amsterdam refused to board ships to Indonesia to fight, and the youth in Genoa have held anti-imperialist demonstrations more than once, shouting "American rulers get out of Italy!" From the Scandinavian Peninsula to Australia, from Canada to South America, the progressive youth of every country have plunged into the struggle to defend world peace and strive for people's democracy. Recently, they have more fervently participated in the peace signing movement, expressing their will to oppose war.

The conspiracies of the Franco regime and the Athenian Royal Fascist government to turn Spain and Greece into imperialist aggressive war bases are increasingly being resolutely opposed and attacked by the youth of the two countries. Under the leadership of the Spanish Communist Party and the United Socialist Youth League, the Spanish youth inherited the tradition of armed defense of the Spanish Republic and have never laid down their weapons. Young people play an active role in the guerrillas, and they also participate in various forms of struggle, including underground activities, sabotage, strikes, etc., which pose a serious threat to the Franco government. The Greek youth, who once heroically participated in the anti-German and Italian fascist battles, are now resisting the new fascist enemies who are oppressing them, and a large number of young men and women soldiers are active in the Grammos Mountains. Other general democratic youth responded to the call of the Greek Democratic Youth League and are carrying out a strong and powerful struggle to establish an all-Greek democratic front against the Greek Royal Fascist group and American imperialism, and to strive for bread, independence, democracy and peace.

　　全世界的青年们为和平、民主与幸福而斗争！
    本报综合报道
    “我们宣誓：我们将记住一九四五年十一月所铸成的团结；不仅这一天，这一星期或这一年，而且永远地记住，直到我们建立了我们所憧憬的并为之而斗争的世界。我们宣誓：我们要建立全世界青年的团结，不分种族、肤色、民族及宗教信仰。我们宣誓：我们要在地球上消灭一切法西斯主义的残迹并建立全世界人民的忠诚友谊。我们宣誓：我们要维护公正持久的和平，消灭剥削和穷困，保障每个人都有工作。我们来此加强全世界青年的团结，向我们的死难的同志致敬，并宣誓不把我们灵巧的手、聪明的头脑和青年的热情浪费在战争里。向着我们的将来前进！”自从五年前世界各国亿万青年的代表在伦敦的世界青年大会上，高举他们的手臂发出上面的誓言以后，“青年团结起来，向着持久和平、民主、各民族独立和美好的将来前进！”的口号就传播到全世界，成为全世界青年斗争的目标。各个国家的青年们，在不同的环境中，正向这同一的目标迈步前进。这世界规模的伟大斗争，不到最后的胜利，是不会休止的。
  苏联青年——世界民主青年胜利的旗帜
    光荣的苏联青年是世界民主青年胜利的旗帜，始终站在世界民主青年的最前列。他们奋不顾身地为社会主义祖国而斗争，同时不屈不挠地为和平、民主、自由和民族独立而斗争。他们成了全世界青年的典范并不是偶然的。
    在伟大的卫国战争的年月中，苏联的青年和全体苏联人民在一起，参加了反法西斯侵略者的斗争，保卫了自己的社会主义祖国。现在，在和平建设的年月中，他们正以高度的热情为列宁、斯大林的伟大事业——共产主义事业的胜利忘我地劳动着。在工业部门中，苏联青年不仅积极参加了社会主义竞赛，努力提高生产率，同时也是社会主义节约运动的首创者和执行者。他们使用着一切国内的科学技术的发现与发明来提高他们的生产技术。在农业部门中，苏联青年对恢复与发展农业生产，有着极大的贡献，他们以积极的劳动造成了空前丰饶的收成。在科学、文学、艺术部门中也不断地涌现着苏联青年所贡献的新的成就。
    在列宁、斯大林党的教育下，苏联青年具有强烈的爱国主义精神，伟大的国际主义精神。苏联青年发挥了高度的国际团结友爱，在世界青年运动中起着主要的领导作用。由于苏联青年促进世界民主青年团结的努力，使真正代表青年利益并为青年利益而斗争的世界民主青年联盟得以诞生；同时，由于苏联青年在其中所起的积极作用，使世界民主青年联盟能够掌握正确的斗争方针，加强团结并胜利地开展活动。苏联青年反法西斯委员会经常与七十多个国家的二百多个青年团体保持着密切的联系，对于世界民主青年的团结也起着重大的作用。
    苏联青年是保卫世界和平运动中最坚强的斗士。他们响应了世界青年联盟的号召，以最大的劳动热忱和政治热情参加斯德哥尔摩和平宣言签名运动。无数青年斯塔哈诺夫工作者，青年劳动英雄和其他优秀青年男女，一致表示要以努力参加共产主义建设的更大成绩来加强世界和平堡垒——苏维埃祖国和斯大林和平政策的力量，支援各国人民和青年反对帝国主义侵略的斗争。
    苏联青年的先锋队列宁共产主义青年团光辉的名字已成为象征全世界青年团结、斗争、胜利与幸福的标志了。
  人民民主国家青年为社会主义建设而奋斗
    曾经为祖国的解放和自由而对法西斯敌人进行过英勇斗争的东南欧人民民主国家的青年，今天正以无比的热情与信心，在进步青年组织的领导下，参加祖国的经济建设工作。集体劳动、突击运动与生产竞赛成了人民民主国家青年活动的重要部分，他们在这方面已经作出了光辉的成绩。
    在一九四八至一九四九的两年中，保加利亚有四十万以上青年参加了建设队与突击队，他们完成了贯穿保加利亚南北部的汉波斯山岭公路与全国最大的罗西茨水坝等大工程。自一九四八年夏季开始，保加利亚青年在人烟稀少的小镇上，建筑起现代化的季米特洛夫城。在一九四七年到一九四八年间，保加利亚青年建设队曾为国家增加了价值二十一亿保币的生产（包括各项修建工程在内），为国家节省了七亿保币的开支。
    捷克斯洛伐克青年在一九四七、四八两年中，配合了政府的二年计划，发动“青年计划”运动。捷克青年联盟的会员在莫斯特和利维诺伏为矿工建设了二百三十一所房子，两条公路，并将曾被德寇夷成平地的利台斯村重建起来。在一九四九年秋收的时候，广大的捷克学生参加了劳动，帮助农民收割，两个月中参加义务劳动的工作时间共一千二百万小时。现在捷克斯洛伐克共有近十五万名青年参加了社会主义竞赛与突击队的运动。
    波兰青年在曾被法西斯德寇破坏殆尽的华沙的复兴工作中，担负了主要的任务。十数万的青年组织了成百个“服务工作队”，修筑了华沙的公路，盖起了高楼大厦，使华沙在短短的期间内恢复了战前壮丽的面貌。
    罗马尼亚的青年建设队在解放以后敷设了长五十一公里的沼气管、三十七公里的煤气管，建筑了长六十一公里的萨尔伐——维沙铁道，三千三百五十九个青年建设队建筑了长达五十四公里的堤岸，在克拉奥夫城建立了一所东南欧最大的车箱修理厂。参加这些建设工作的青年达二十万人。
    匈牙利有九百个青年生产组、五百个建设队与四万名个人竞赛者。在匈牙利劳动青年联盟的领导下，匈牙利青年正为他们的美好生活而奋斗。
    阿尔巴尼亚青年在阿尔巴尼亚共产主义青年联盟的领导下，在解放后卷入了建设祖国的热潮。一九四六年，四千青年完成了一条六十五公里的公路。阿尔巴尼亚历史上第一条铁路的建筑工程，也是由六万阿尔巴尼亚青年完成的。
    德国青年经过了大战的苦难，在苏联军队击溃了希特勒法西斯之后，找到了走向民主、自由与幸福的道路。自一九四六年自由德国青年联盟成立以来，德国的民主青年运动有很大的发展。数十万德国青年参加劳动竞赛，为恢复被战争所破坏的德国国民经济而努力。但是，在美英帝国主义者残暴统治下的西德，青年们却还生活在饥饿、贫困的灾难之中。今年五月底在柏林召开的全德青年大会，就是德国整个青年一代为争取和平、争取德国民主统一的坚强意志的表现。
  亚洲青年为民族解放而斗争
    亚洲的青年在东方殖民地与半殖民地各国民族解放运动中，担负着重要的艰巨的任务。他们已把他们争取民族独立与自由的斗争看成保卫世界和平的斗争的一部分。中国人民的伟大胜利使他们的胜利信心大大加强，他们正在汲取中国人民丰富的革命经验，进行英勇不屈的斗争，加速胜利的到来。
    朝鲜青年今天已站在反帝国主义斗争的最前线。广大的朝鲜青年在朝鲜民主青年同盟的领导下，在自己祖国的国土上进行着英勇艰苦的战斗。在前线与美国侵略者作战的十数万青年战士，连续地获得了光辉的战绩，后方的青年们正在源源不绝地踊跃参军。在工厂里、在农村中，男女青年都在自己的岗位上为支援前线而工作。有两万多人组成了“前线作业班”，保证完成加紧生产的任务。另外还有青年组织的“抢修队”与敌机的疯狂破坏作艰苦的斗争。
    越南青年在民族解放斗争中有过伟大的贡献，现在在越南青年联盟与其他进步青年组织的领导下，响应了政府准备总反攻的号召，加强努力参加与支援击败美法侵略者的战争。全越的青年热烈展开了参军运动，仅今年上半年，北越第三战区就有一万名青年参加越南解放军与游击队。其他生产岗位上的青年也以忘我的劳动增加生产，支援前线，争取胜利。
    马来亚青年一直是反对英帝殖民统治的斗争的先锋。目前，马来亚青年们踊跃地参加马共领导的人民解放军，与英国殖民地进行坚决的战斗。
    日本的进步青年，团结在日本共产党的周围，为反对美国帝国主义把日本变成殖民地与侵略基地的非法行动而进行着斗争。今年五月，日本青年的反帝斗争达到了新的高潮。美帝发动侵朝战争以后，日本青年在艰苦的局势下，一致奋起，采取有力的斗争行动，反对美帝以日本为侵略前哨。
    印度、印尼、缅甸等国的青年运动亦日益扩大，各国的进步青年组织团结了广大青年进行斗争，最近在和平签名运动中尤其表现了强大的力量。
  资本主义国家青年坚决反对战贩的阴谋
    资本主义国家的青年们不顾反动统治者对于进步活动的种种压制，日益加强地团结在进步和民主的青年组织的周围，为自身的经济利益与民主权利而进行斗争。他们进一步认识到争取本身权利的斗争与争取和平斗争是不可分的。他们积极参加了保卫世界和平运动。
    美国的进步青年协会与劳动青年联盟，英国的共产主义青年团与国际青年协会，法国的共和青年联盟，意大利的共产主义青年联盟与青年同盟，荷兰的青年联盟，澳大利亚的尤里加青年联盟与维多利亚民主青年协会，加拿大的全国劳动青年联盟等，都在领导着各国进步青年进行不屈不挠的斗争，反对帝国主义者准备新战争的阴谋，争取民主权利与幸福生活、争取人民民主与持久和平。法国、意大利、英国、丹麦等国家的青年不断举行示威，拒绝卸运战争物资，反对进行殖民战争。尼斯港的青年码头工人勇敢地把美制的坦克大炮推下海去，阿姆斯特丹的青年士兵拒绝登轮开赴印度尼西亚作战，热那亚的青年不止一次地举行反对帝国主义的示威，高呼“美国的统治者滚出意大利！”的口号。从斯堪的那维亚半岛到澳大利亚，从加拿大到南美洲，每个国家的进步青年都已投入了保卫世界和平，争取人民民主的斗争。最近更狂热的参加和平签名运动，表示他们反对战争的意志。
    佛朗哥政权与雅典保皇法西斯政府把西班牙与希腊变成帝国主义侵略战争基地的阴谋，愈来愈受到两国青年的坚决反对与打击。西班牙青年在西班牙共产党和统一社会主义青年联盟的领导下，继承了武装保卫西班牙共和国的传统，始终没有放下过武器。青年们在游击队中起着积极的作用，此外他们还参加各种形式的斗争，包括地下活动、怠工破坏、罢工等，使佛朗哥政府感受严重的威胁。希腊的青年们曾经英勇地参加过反德、意法西斯的战斗的，现在正向压迫他们的新的法西斯敌人抗战，大批的男女青年战士在格拉姆斯山区活跃着。其他一般的民主青年响应了希腊民主青年联盟的号召，正为建立反对希腊保皇法西斯集团和美帝国主义的全希腊民主阵线，争取面包、独立、民主与和平，进行着坚强有力的斗争。（附图片）
