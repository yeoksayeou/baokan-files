　　Strengthening Communication in Urban-Rural Exchange and Cooperation Between Cooperatives
    Business Development of Beijing Cooperative Depot
    [Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Cooperative Depot under the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative (expanded and reorganized from the former Farmers' Hostel) has gradually developed its business over the past eight months, and has now become a trusted institution for many local cooperatives and state-owned enterprises to sell and purchase goods on commission in Beijing. It has played a significant role in facilitating the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas and strengthening ties between neighboring cooperatives.
    From January to August this year, the Cooperative Depot purchased agricultural and industrial products for various local cooperatives, state-owned enterprises, and rural merchants totaling over 20 billion yuan, averaging over 2.5 billion yuan per month. Sales on commission amounted to over 35 billion yuan, averaging over 4.4 billion yuan per month, and the monthly volume of goods purchased and sold on commission gradually increased. Local cooperatives accounted for the largest share, with both sales and purchases on commission accounting for 80 to 90 percent. This has reduced intermediate exploitation in the purchase and sale of products between cooperatives, state-owned enterprises, and rural merchants, thereby reducing the cost of goods. According to conservative estimates, the handling fees alone saved more than 54.7 million yuan in the goods purchased and sold through the Cooperative Depot in August alone.
    With the gradual development of business, the types of goods purchased and sold on commission by the Beijing Cooperative Depot are increasing day by day, and the areas are also expanding. In addition to large quantities of grain, homespun cloth, and mountain products from the surrounding provinces, there are also sugar, sesame seed cakes, and bicycles from the Northeast, and cool mats and umbrellas from Zhejiang Province. In August, cooperatives and state-owned enterprises from one administrative region, seven provinces, three cities, eleven special districts, and forty-two counties used the Cooperative Depot to purchase and sell goods on commission.
    In order to gradually move this business towards planning, the depot has begun to adopt the method of signing contracts between societies and between societies and state-owned enterprises. This can simplify purchasing and sales procedures, further save manpower and financial resources for both buyers and sellers, and promote the standardization of products in various places and strengthen mutual ties. Up to now, the depot has completed eighteen cases of purchase and sale on commission using the contract method, and has gained initial experience, proving that this is one of the best ways to purchase and sell on commission.

　　沟通城乡交流加强合作社间联系
    京合作货栈业务发展
    【京市新闻处讯】京市供销合作总社所属的合作货栈（是由先前的农民招待所扩充改组的），八个月来，业务逐步开展，现在已成为不少地方合作社、国营企业在京代销、代购货品的信托机构。在沟通城乡物资的交流和加强各邻区合作社间的联系上，起了很大的作用。
    合作货栈从今年一月到八月，给各地合作社、国营企业及农村商贩代购农产品和工业品的金额共达二百多亿，平均每月二十五亿元以上；代销金额达三百五十多亿元，平均每月四十四亿余元；且每月代销代购货品的数额逐渐增加。其中以各地合作社占的数额最大，代售代销均在百分之八十到九十以上。这样，便使各合作社、国营企业和农民商贩，在彼此购销产品中减少了中间剥削，因之也就减低了货品的成本。据最低估计：八月份一月，通过合作货栈代购代销的货品中，只是手续费一项，就节省了五千四百七十余万元。
    在业务逐步发展的情况下，京市合作货栈代购代销的货品种类一天天增多，地区也日渐扩大。现除周围各省各地的大批粮食、土布、山货等外，还有东北来的糖、芝麻子饼、自行车，浙江省运来的凉席、雨伞等。八月份中有一个行政区、七个省、三个市、十一个专区和四十二个县的合作社及国营企业都曾通过合作货栈代为购销货品。
    该栈为使这一业务逐渐走向计划性，已开始在社与社之间、社与国营企业之间，采取订立合同的办法。这样，一方面可以简化购销手续，进一步节省买卖双方的人力财力，另一方面且能促使各地产品规格化，加强彼此联系。截至现在止，经该栈用订合同的办法完成代购代销的已有十八起，并已获得初步经验，证明这是代购代销最好的方式之一。
