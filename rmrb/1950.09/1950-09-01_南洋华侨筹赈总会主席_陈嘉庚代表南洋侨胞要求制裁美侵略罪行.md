Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, August 31st: Chen Jiageng, Chairman of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Relief General Association, sent a telegram from here on the 30th to the Security Council, protesting the atrocities of American aircraft invading our country's airspace and massacring our compatriots. The telegram stated: "The provocative and brutal acts of military aircraft of the American invading Korean forces invading the airspace of our People's Republic of China and indiscriminately strafing our compatriots have aroused unparalleled anger among our overseas Chinese. I, on behalf of the Nanyang Overseas Chinese, firmly support the demands in the protest note submitted by Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai of the Central People's Government of our People's Republic of China to the American government, and the accusations and suggestions submitted to the United Nations Security Council. We demand that the Security Council immediately take measures to sanction the American invading Korean forces for their aggressive crimes against our country, and order the American troops to withdraw from Korea, in the interest of peace in the Far East. We, the overseas Chinese compatriots, will further promote the spirit of loving the motherland and unite closely with the people of the motherland to strive to support the just struggle of the motherland."
