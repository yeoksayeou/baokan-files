　　Changes in the Rural Areas Around Beijing
    Zhao Youfu
    From the founding of the People's Republic of China to October 1st this year, a full year has passed. In this year, unprecedented changes have taken place in the rural areas around Beijing. After the completion of the land reform, the poor peasants who had been hired laborers for generations were allocated land, farm tools, and livestock and were liberated. With land ownership transferred to the peasants, the threat that landlords would increase rents when the land yielded more grain was eliminated. This greatly boosted the peasants' enthusiasm for production, and everyone is working hard to improve the land, apply more fertilizer, cultivate deeply and meticulously, and strive for increased production. The landlords who used to live by exploiting others, the vagrants who relied on trickery, abduction, fraud, and theft, and the monks who did nothing but eat all day, under the education and influence of the idea that labor is the most glorious thing, have all actively participated in production. The entire rural area around Beijing has changed its face, with every family striving to produce and their lives gradually improving. Everywhere, there is a vibrant new atmosphere.
  Land Reform Changes the Face of the Countryside
    Huai Fang Village in the 11th District was originally a village with more hungry people than well-fed ones. The village had 331 households with a total of 6,426 mu of land. The 32 landlord households occupied 4,356 mu of irrigated and good dry land, while the 178 poor peasant and farmhand households only owned 305 mu of alkaline and low-lying land that was subject to flooding nine years out of ten. Each person owned an average of only 0.3 mu of land, so 60 percent of the peasants in the village could not make ends meet and had to sell their labor to survive. There were 75 households who were hired laborers year-round, such as the Zhang Shiliang family with seven members, five of whom worked as day laborers outside the village but still could not make a living.
    After the land reform, 156 poor peasant and farmhand households were allocated 932 mu of land and obtained farm tools and livestock. Those who were exploited and oppressed in the past were liberated from this point on.
    This spring, as soon as the topsoil thawed and the weather was still very cold, the peasants of Huai Fang Village went to work in the fields. They were opening ditches, backfilling dry land, delivering manure, and repairing farm tools...The peasants were busily and enthusiastically engaged in production in the fields and at home. In the past, they wouldn't have even delivered manure at this time of year. With the high production enthusiasm of the liberated peasants, Huai Fang Village alone opened more than 70 mu of ditches and more than 60 mu of paddy fields, dug ten new brick wells, and installed 21 new waterwheels, expanding the area of paddy fields by more than 130 mu. Bao Jinming, a farmhand who had just been allocated land, started digging soil to backfill his land even before the soil thawed, turning the five mu of alkaline and low-lying land he had been allocated into good irrigated land. Liu Chao'ge, the director of the peasant association, said, "Huai Fang Village has become better, and it will become even better in another year or two."
  Idlers Become Laborers
    Through land reform and the launching of the production movement, most landlords, vagrants, lazy people, and monks have participated in production. Among the sixteen people in Huai Fang Village, such as Zou Xuetang, Gao Yulu, and Zhao Guangrui, who used to be vagrants skilled in trickery, abduction, theft, eating, drinking, gambling, whoring, and opium smoking, fifteen have participated in labor after being allocated land during the land reform and being educated by cadres and the masses of peasants. Gao Yulu, who corrected his ways, said, "In the past, I didn't even have a clod of earth. What could I do but steal and cheat? Now that I have land, I have to produce well." He dug low and backfilled high on the four mu of low-lying alkaline land he had been allocated, planting rice and corn. Now, the rice and corn are growing very well, and he even helps others work when he has free time. Xiao Wencheng, a vagrant who was also skilled in eating, drinking, gambling, and stealing, was allocated three mu of paddy fields and four mu of dry land during the land reform. He hoed his dry land four times this year and harvested more than ten shi of corn. When others saw him, they said, "Wencheng, you have cultivated your land really well." He always said, "I'm still far from being good at farming!" Zhang Puli, who had been a monk for more than 20 years and relied on chanting scriptures for food, now does everything from farming and collecting manure to fishing. Of the 23 landlords in the village with the ability to work, 21 have participated in labor. Zhang Qin, a landlord who wouldn't even bother to pick up an overturned oil bottle in the past, now also waters gardens, hoes the land, and sells vegetables. The peasants all said, "Land reform is well done. Idlers have become workers."
  Rural Women Participate in Labor
    After the land reform, the vast majority of women in rural areas have gone to work in the fields. According to statistics from Huai Fang Village and its nearby villages, such as Xi Wu Hao, Shi Ba Li Dian, and Jiu Gong, a total of 4,722 women have participated in agricultural production. Tao Xu Shi of Huai Fang Village farms eight mu of land by herself. Plowing, planting, hoeing, and delivering manure are all done by herself or by hired labor. Wang Ji Shi of Jixian Village hoed her five mu of land four times and collected manure whenever she had free time. Gao Shuzhen of Nangong Village led seven women to form a mutual aid group, which not only hoed their own land four times and hoed the land together as day laborers, but also earned 1.4 shi of wheat and 160,000 yuan, and helped military dependents hoe 20 mu of land. The saying, "If you want to eat to your heart's content, you have to do it yourself," is widely circulated among women in various villages. The labor force of the vast majority of women in rural areas being invested in production after the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing has enabled agricultural production to develop even further.
  Peasants Eliminate Worries About Increasing Production, Boldly Improve Land and Actively Produce
    "The land is our own, so we have to work harder and cultivate the land well." After the land reform, the peasants' enthusiasm for production was unprecedentedly high. Every family is applying more fertilizer, weeding more, and cultivating deeply and meticulously. Mutual aid groups for hiring labor were also generally formed to solve the shortage of livestock. Peasants bought more livestock and farm tools with their surplus labor, directly increasing production efficiency. People can be seen everywhere collecting manure early in the morning. Lao Jun Tang Village in the 11th District alone hauled more than 5,000 carts of black soil, four times more than last year. Shi Ba Li Dian hauled more than 6,600 carts of black soil this year, applying an extra half a cart of black soil fertilizer to each mu of land. Peasants in Xiao Hong Men Village bought 84 more carts of manure ash fertilizer than last year. The 11th District alone applied 27,252 more carts of urine and manure fertilizer than usual.
    Before liberation, peasants hoed the land at most three times. This year, most peasants in the suburbs of Beijing have hoed the land four times, and some have even hoed it five times. Du Wenkui, a peasant in Jixian Village, said, "In the past, when I was farming the landlord's land, I was terrified and didn't dare to apply too much fertilizer or hoe too much, because if I harvested more grain, the rent would be increased every year. In the past, I planted gourds on a piece of land for two consecutive years and applied a lot of fertilizer, hoping to grow a good crop in the third year, but the second landlord found out and wanted to take the land back before the autumn harvest was even finished. I pleaded, begged, and offered to increase the rent, but it didn't work. Now that the land is my own, I can apply more fertilizer and take good care of it without any worries." Many peasants in Sihai Zhuang, Huai Fang Village, spent a lot of effort using hoes to turn over the soil because they believed that deep plowing could increase the yield. Yan Yongkui, a peasant, used a hoe to turn over his nine mu of land for 21 days. He said, "It doesn't matter if it takes more effort, as long as I can harvest more grain."
  Bachelors Who Have Been Hired Laborers for Decades Get Married
    Poor peasants have been allocated land, are no longer working as beasts of burden for landlords, and their lives are getting better. Many bachelors who have been hired laborers for two or three decades have gotten married this year after the land reform. In Huai Fang Village alone, six hired laborers who were bachelors in the past have gotten married. Yan Yongkui said, "I am 44 years old this year and have been a hired laborer for more than 20 years. I have been worried about food and clothing every year. This year, I was allocated land, I was liberated, and I got married. This is a complete liberation." Li Changyou, a liberated farmhand in Majiabao, married Wang Yinglan, an elementary school student. Before getting married, Li Changyou asked Wang Yinglan, "I am a hired laborer. Do you love me?" Wang Yinglan replied, "Now, labor is glorious. Only through labor can we have food to eat. Isn't it even better that you have been a hired laborer and can labor?"

　　京郊农村的变化
    赵有福
    中华人民共和国成立到今年十月一日，整整一年了。在这一年中，京郊农村中起了空前的变化。土地改革完成后，从祖辈起就扛长活的贫穷农民都分得了土地、农具和牲畜，翻了身；土地归为农民所有，过去地里多打了粮食，地主就会加租的威胁消除了，农民的生产情绪高涨，人人都在改良土地，多施肥料，深耕细作，为增产努力。以前靠剥削人吃饭的地主，靠坑、拐、骗、偷的二流子及终日吃饭不干活的和尚，在劳动最光荣的教育与影响下纷纷参加生产。整个京郊农村的面貌变了，家家努力生产，生活逐步改善，处处是一片蓬勃的新气象。
  土地改革改变了农村面貌
    十一区的槐房村，原是个饥人多饱人少的村子。全村三百三十一户，共土地六千四百二十六亩。三十二户地主就占去了四千三百五十六亩水浇地和好旱地，一百七十八户贫雇农只占有三百零五亩的十年九涝的碱洼地，每人平均只占地三分，所以全村百分之六十的农民终生不得温饱，只好靠出卖血汗劳力为生。村中长年当雇工的就有七十五户，如张世良一家七口，有五个人长年在外替人家打短工仍不能维持生活。
    经过土地改革，一百五十六户贫雇农分得了九百三十二亩土地，并获得了农具和牲畜，过去被剥削被压榨的从此翻了身。
    今年春，地刚消了一层皮，天气还很冷时，槐房村的农民便都下地工作了。开通子地、垫旱地、送粪、收拾农具……，农民在地里、家里处处紧张热烈地进行生产。但在往年，像这时候连粪还未送哩。在翻身农民高涨的生产情绪下，槐房村一个村就开了通子地七十多亩，稻田六十多亩，新打砖井十眼，新装水车二十一架，扩大了水田一百三十多亩。新分得土地的雇农包金明，当土地还没消冻时，就开始挖土垫地，把分得的五亩碱洼地，垫成了好水浇地。农会主任刘朝阁说：“槐房村变好了，再过一两年就变得更好了。”
  闲荡人变成了劳动者
    经过土地改革和发动生产运动，地主、二流子、懒汉、和尚都大部参加了生产。槐房村的邹雪堂、高玉禄、赵光瑞等十六个人中，过去因为没有土地，是拐、骗、偷、吃、喝、嫖、赌、抽十全的二流子。土地改革中分到了土地，经过干部和农民群众的教育，已有十五个参加了劳动。改邪归正的高玉禄说：“过去我连个地渣也没有，不偷不骗怎么办？现在有了土地，我得好好的生产。”他把分得的四亩洼碱地，挖低垫高，栽稻种玉米。现在稻子玉米都长得很好了，并且自己有空暇还帮助别人干活。过去也是吃、喝、嫖、偷四通的二流子萧文成，土改时他分得了三亩稻地四亩旱田。他今年把旱田锄了四遍，打了十石多玉米。别人见了他就说：“文成，你的地种得真好。”他总是说：“咱学种地还差得远呢！”出家当了二十多年和尚专靠念经吃饭的张仆立，现在是种地、拾粪、打鱼样样干。全村有劳动能力的地主共二十三人，已有二十一个参加劳动。地主张勤过去是油瓶倒了都不去扶的人，现在也浇园、锄地、卖菜了。农民们都说：“土地改革作得好，闲荡人都变成干活的人了。”
  农村妇女参加了劳动
    土地改革后农村中广大妇女都下地劳动了。仅槐房村及其附近的西五号、十八里店、旧宫等十八个村子统计，就有四千七百二十二个妇女参加了农业生产。槐房村陶许氏，单独一个人种八亩地。耕、种、锄和送粪都是自己干或拨工干。集贤村的王计氏，自己把五亩地锄了四遍，一有空闲就拾粪。南宫村高淑珍领导七个妇女组成了互助组，不仅把他们自己的土地锄了四遍，在一起打短锄地，还挣小麦一石四斗，挣人民币十六万元，并且给军属帮忙锄地二十亩。各村妇女间普遍流传着：“要吃称心饭，自己下手干。”京郊土改后农村广大妇女的劳动力投入生产，使农业生产得到更大的发展。
  农民消除了增产顾虑，放手改良土地积极生产
    “土地是咱们自己的了，就得多卖力气，把地种好。”土改后农民分得了土地，生产情绪空前高涨。家家都在多施肥、多锄草，深耕细作。解决牲口缺乏的拨工互助组也普遍的组成了。农民们有余力就添购牲畜、农具，直接提高了生产效率。清晨到处是拾粪的人。十一区的老君堂一个村就拉了五千多车黑土，超过去年四倍。十八里店今年拉黑土六千六百多车，作到每亩地多施半车黑土肥。小红门村农民比去年多买大粪干八十四车。仅十一区一个区就比常年多施二万七千二百五十二车尿潮粪的肥料。
    解放前，农民最多是锄地三遍，京郊农民今年大部都作到锄地四遍，有的还锄了五遍。集贤村农民杜文奎说：“以前种地主的地，吓得提心吊胆的，不敢多上粪，更不敢多锄，因为多打了粮食，就会年年加租子。过去有一块地我连种了两年田瓜，上的粪挺多，指望第三年长一年好庄稼，可是二地主知道了，在第二年秋收还没收拾完，他就要把地收回了。我说好话、哀求、涨租子都不行。现在地是自己的了，我可以毫无顾虑地多多施肥好好照应了。”槐房村四海庄不少农民因为用镐翻地深可以多打粮食，便费了很大功夫用镐翻地。农民阎永奎的九亩地用镐撅了二十一天，他说：“多费力气不要紧，多打粮食就行了。”
  扛了几十年长活的光棍汉结婚了
    贫苦农民分了地，不再为地主作牛马，光景都好起来了。扛了二、三十年长活的光棍汉子，在土改后今年有很多的人结了婚。仅槐房村一个村子就有过去扛长活的六个雇工光棍汉结了婚。阎永奎说：“我今年四十四岁，扛了二十多年长活，年年愁吃愁穿，今年分了土地，翻了身，又结了婚，这真是翻透身了。”马家堡翻身雇工李长有和一个高小学生王英兰结了婚，在结婚前，李长有问王英兰：“我是个扛长活的，你爱我吗？”王英兰答道：“现在是劳动光荣，只有劳动才能有饭吃，你扛过长活能劳动，不更好吗？”
