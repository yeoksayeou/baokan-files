Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 22nd: The General Committee of the United Nations General Assembly held a meeting on the morning of September 21st. At the beginning of the meeting, it accepted Chairman Andrian's suggestion to recommend to the General Assembly that November 30th be set as the closing date for the Fifth General Assembly. The committee then began considering the provisional agenda. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky opposed including "Threats to the Political Independence and Territorial Integrity of Greece" on the agenda. He said: The purpose of proposing this item is to divert attention from the continuous acts of terror carried out by the Greek royalist fascist government. Vyshinsky said: The American and British blocs, which hold a majority in the committee, are proposing this matter in an attempt to shift responsibility for the Greek situation onto Greece's northern neighbors. Only by stopping foreign interference and withdrawing foreign troops and missions can the Greek situation be truly resolved. Vyshinsky emphasized that this is something the General Assembly should take action on, and pointed out that in order to normalize the Greek situation, it is necessary to stop the royalist fascists' acts of terror and hold general amnesties and general elections. Vyshinsky said: The General Assembly should pay attention to ensuring that such elections are conducted in a democratic manner. Vyshinsky concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation believes that the proposed item is completely false and completely distorts the true situation. However, despite opposition from the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia to including this item on the agenda, the committee still accepted it.

    Kuomintang elements actually slandered that China's political independence and territorial integrity were threatened by the so-called "Soviet violation" of the 1945 Sino-Soviet Treaty. Regarding this item, Vyshinsky recalled that when this item was discussed last year, the Soviet delegation had pointed out that the accusation was completely unfounded. Vyshinsky said: In reality, this is not an item on the agenda, but merely a slander raised by those ghosts who have been thrown onto the rubbish heap of history. Vyshinsky scoffed at the assertion that disputes had occurred between the Soviet Union and the Chinese government, and pointed out that the Soviet Union had recently concluded a treaty with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, which demonstrated and confirmed the extremely friendly relations between the two governments. He added: The integrity of Chinese territory has been genuinely threatened due to the United States' attempt to annex Taiwan in disregard of the Cairo Declaration, the US Air Force's bombing of Northeast China, and other aggressive actions by the United States in the Far East. In the vote, with eleven votes in favor, two votes against (Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia), and India abstaining, the committee passed this item.

    Vyshinsky strongly opposed the part of the "Freedom of Information" item in the proposed agenda that discussed "interference with radio signals." He pointed out that when the Economic and Social Council made a decision on this issue, the decision was illegal because representatives from the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia had not attended for legitimate reasons. Therefore, the Soviet delegation did not consider the decision to be legally binding, especially because this item slanderously and rudely opposed certain countries.

    The committee first accepted this part, then accepted the entire item, each time with twelve votes in favor and the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia against.

    Vyshinsky also opposed the item "Situation in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania regarding respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms: Advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice." Vyshinsky said that this was merely a technique to mask unwarranted interference in the internal affairs of these three countries, and that the motive for this interference stemmed from hatred and animosity toward the achievements of the new democratic countries.

    The committee passed this item as usual with a mechanical majority.

    The committee agreed to remove the Secretary-General's report on the draft declaration on the rights and obligations of states from the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. Previously, Vyshinsky and Venezuelan representative González had pointed out that this matter could only be formally submitted to the General Assembly after the governments of various countries had submitted their opinions on the draft, but so far only eight governments had submitted their opinions.

    Regarding the item proposed by the Dominican Republic concerning the relationship between the United Nations Member States and various international organizations and Franco's Spain, Vyshinsky declared that there was no reason to re-discuss a matter that the first session of the United Nations General Assembly had already resolved, unless the committee intended to cater to the evil alliance between certain American bankers and the former Hitler vassal Franco. Vyshinsky also said that it was clear that some Americans wanted to turn Franco into their own vassal. He concluded by saying that these things were new developments, but they were not sufficient to serve as an excuse to change the General Assembly's attitude toward Franco.

    But the US voting machine started up again, and the General Committee passed this item, with ten votes in favor, two votes against (Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia), and two votes (Cuba, Iran) abstaining.

    When discussing the item proposed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia, which falsely accused the Soviet Union of failing to repatriate all prisoners of war, Soviet Representative Malik scoffed at this item as another example of fabrication by the United States with the assistance of the United Kingdom and the customary agreement of Australia. Malik pointed out that, according to Article 107 of the United Nations Charter, the General Assembly shall not consider any action taken by the victorious powers directly related to the previous World War. He later emphasized that, as announced in the TASS communique, this matter had been completely resolved, and therefore, even if this matter could be discussed, there was nothing to discuss.

    In a long-winded speech, US Representative Austin argued that the Security Council's handling of the Berlin issue was a precedent that supposedly proved that Article 107 of the Charter did not apply. Malik replied to Austin by saying that the Soviet Union was never afraid to make a statement on any issue, but this item was clearly slanderous. It was clear that the United States did not consider any session of the General Assembly to be successful if it did not raise such fabrications. The United States' adoption of such means did not strengthen international friendship, but worsened international relations.

    Regarding the Berlin issue, Malik said that dragging this issue into the United Nations blatantly violated the United Nations Charter. Malik said: The Berlin issue has been resolved by bilateral consultations between Jessup and Malik. Malik referred to a statement by Jessup that Austin had cited, insisting that Article 107 of the Charter did not prohibit the consideration of the Berlin issue in the Security Council. Malik said that it was true that Jessup made such a statement; but it was also true that Jessup said some completely different things when discussing with Malik; so Austin's arguments regarding Jessup's statement were of no effect. Malik concluded by saying that the Berlin issue that Austin cited was, in fact, a perfect example of why the United States was wrong to raise such issues in the United Nations. Malik also said that the only connection between the United Nations and the Malik-Jessup talks was that their talks started at the United Nations headquarters. They both thanked the United Nations for providing them with this location.

    After this, the General Committee decided to accept this item with the usual twelve votes in favor.

    When reviewing the item proposed by the United States – "The Question of Formosa (US term for Taiwan – editor's note)" – Malik asked Austin: What proposal does the United States intend to put forward under this item? Austin's reply was evasive. Malik pointed out that it can be proven by the incompleteness of Austin's reply that the United States may intend to discuss the status of Taiwan (Formosa), while Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Since the status of Taiwan was decided in the Cairo Declaration and confirmed in Potsdam, according to Article 107 of the Charter, the General Assembly shall not review the status of Taiwan. But Malik said: Here, there is the issue of US aggression against China, which is what the Soviet delegation has proposed as an agenda item that the General Assembly should consider.

    The Kuomintang group representative Jiang Tingfu insisted on delaying the decision because the United States had not yet submitted an explanatory memorandum on the Formosa issue, and also because Jiang Tingfu had not received instructions from his "country."

    Malik urged an immediate decision and declared that the United States' failure to submit a memorandum could not be used as a reason to delay the decision. But Austin granted Jiang Tingfu's request, so the chairman announced that this item was temporarily withdrawn. British representative Jebb similarly proposed postponing the handling of the Soviet proposal, saying that the nature of the Soviet accusations against the United States was unclear, and claimed that no decision could be taken without a memorandum.

    Malik said that a memorandum would be submitted, but at the same time said that there was no reason to delay a decision on the Soviet proposal, because the Soviet accusation was a clear issue, based on the United States' actions against Taiwan, the bombing of Northeast China, and other aggressive actions in the Far East that also affected China - this was very clear.

    Malik accepted Andrian's suggestion that the title of the Soviet-proposed item should be changed to begin with the word "accusation". The committee then accepted the British suggestion not to make a decision on the Soviet-proposed item for the time being. The review of the provisional agenda ended here, and the committee announced a recess and will reconvene on the morning of September 22.

　　联大综合委员会讨论临时议程
    苏代表提议大会应审议美国侵台问题
    美操纵多数非法通过歪曲事实的项目
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：联合国大会综合委员会在九月二十一日上午举行会议。会议一开始就接受了主席安迪让的建议，即由委员会向联大建议定十一月三十日为第五届联大闭幕日期。然后，委员会开始考虑临时议程。苏联代表维辛斯基反对把“对希腊的政治独立与领土完整的威胁”一项列入议程。他说：这一项目的提出，是为了转移人们对于希腊保皇法西斯政府所进行的不间断的恐怖行径的注意。维辛斯基说：在委员会中占有多数的美英集团提出这件事，目的是企图把希腊形势的责任转嫁到希腊的北方邻国身上。只有停止外国干涉和撤退外国部队与使团，才能真正解决希腊的形势。维辛斯基强调这是联大应该对之采取行动的事情，并指出：要使希腊形势正常化，必须停止保皇法西斯的恐怖行径，并举行大赦和大选。维辛斯基说：联大应注意使这种选举以民主的方式进行。维辛斯基末了说：苏联代表团认为，所提出的项目完全是虚伪的，并且完全歪曲真实情况。可是，尽管苏联和捷克斯洛伐克反对把这一项目列入议程，委员会却仍接受了这一项目。
    国民党分子竟然诽谤说中国政治独立与领土完整因所谓“苏联违反”一九四五年的中苏条约而受到威胁。维辛斯基就这一项目追忆说：当去年讨论这一项目时，苏联代表团已指出控诉是完全没有根据的。维辛斯基说：实际上这不是议程中的项目，而仅是那些已被抛到历史垃圾堆上的鬼魂们所提出的诽谤。维辛斯基齿笑苏联与中国政府之间发生争端的断言，并指出苏联最近曾和中华人民共和国中央人民政府缔结条约，这表明并证实了两国政府之间极其友好的关系。他又说：由于美国企图不顾开罗宣言吞并台湾，由于美国空军轰炸中国东北，由于美国在远东的其他侵略行动，中国领土的完整倒受到了真正的威胁。表决结果，十一票赞成，两票反对（苏联及捷克斯洛伐克），印度弃权，委员会通过了这个项目。
    维辛斯基强烈反对已提出的议程中关于“新闻自由”这一项目中论及“无线电信号干扰”的一部分。他指出经社理事会对这一问题采取决定时，由于苏联、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克代表因正当理由未曾出席，因此该决定是非法的，因此苏联代表团并不认为该决定有法律上的约束力，尤其是因为这个项目是诽谤地、粗暴地反对某些国家的。
    委员会首先接受了这一部分，然后接受整个项目，每次表决中有十二票赞成，苏联与捷克斯洛伐克反对。
    维辛斯基也反对“保加利亚、匈牙利和罗马尼亚尊重人权和基本自由的情形：国际法庭对它们的忠告”这一项目。维辛斯基说，这仅仅是掩饰无故干涉这三个国家的内政的一种手法，而这种干涉的动机则是出于憎恶与仇恨新民主国家的成就。
    委员会照旧以机械的多数通过了这一项目。
    委员会同意自本届大会议程中取消秘书长关于国家之权利与义务宣言草案的报告。事先维辛斯基和委内瑞拉代表贡扎里茨曾经指出，这件事情只有在各国政府对该草案提出意见之后才能够正式向大会提出，可是迄今仅有八国政府提出了意见。
    关于多米尼加共和国所提出的联合国会员国以及各国际机构和佛朗哥西班牙的关系这一项目，维辛斯基宣称，重新讨论联合国大会第一届会议已经解决的问题是没有理由的，除非委员会打算照顾某些美国银行家和前希特勒附庸佛朗哥之间的邪恶的同盟，维辛斯基又称，显然地，有些美国人想把佛朗哥变为他们自己的附庸。他最后说，这些事情是新的发展，但是它们不足成为改变大会对佛朗哥的态度的口实。
    但是美国的表决机器再次开动，综合委员会即通过了这一项目，十票赞成，两票（苏联、捷克斯洛伐克）反对，两票（古巴、伊朗）弃权。
    当讨论英、美、澳三国所提诬指苏联未能将全部战俘遣送回国这一项目时，苏联代表马立克齿笑这一项目是美国在英国的协助下和澳大利亚的照例附和下凭空捏造的又一例证。马立克指出：根据联合国宪章第一百零七条，大会不得审议各战胜国与前次世界大战直接有关的任何行动。以后他又着重指出：正如塔斯社公报所宣布，这件事已完全解决，因而这件事即使能够讨论，也并没有什么可以讨论。
    美国代表奥斯汀在咬文嚼字的长篇发言中，硬说安理会受理柏林问题，就是一个据说证明宪章第一百零七条不能适用的先例。马立克答复奥斯汀称：苏联从来不怕对任何问题提出声明，但这一项目显然是诽谤。显然美国认为：联大任何一次会议如果没有提出这种捏造就都不算是成功。美国采取这种手段，没有加强国际友谊，而是使国际关系恶化。
    关于柏林问题，马立克称：把这一问题扯到联合国中来，彰明昭著地破坏了联合国宪章。马立克称：柏林问题已由耶塞普和马立克间的双边商谈予以解决。马立克提到奥斯汀曾引耶塞普声明的一段话硬说宪章第一百零七条并不能禁止在安理会中审议柏林问题，马立克说，耶塞普作了这样的声明，这是真的；但耶塞普在与马立克讨论时，也说了一些完全不同的话，这也是真的；所以奥斯汀论列耶塞普的声明，是没有什么效用的。马立克末了说：奥斯汀所引述的柏林问题，事实上是一件完美的例证，说明美国在联合国中提出这种问题是错误的。马立克又说：联合国与马立克——耶塞普会谈间绝无仅有的一点关系，仅仅是他们两人的会谈是在联合国会址里开始的。他们两人都感谢联合国供给他们这一块地方。
    在此以后，综合委员会即以照例的十二赞成票，决定受理这一项目。
    当审查美国所提的项目——“福摩萨（美国对台湾的称呼——编者注）问题”——时，马立克问奥斯汀：美国在这个项目下，打算提出什么建议？奥斯汀的答复支吾其词。马立克指出：由奥斯汀答词的不完全，就可以证明：美国可能有意讨论台湾（福摩萨）的地位，而台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。既然台湾的地位在开罗宣言中早有决定，又在波茨坦予以确认，因而根据宪章第一百零七条，大会不得审议台湾的地位。但是马立克说：这里有美国侵略中国的问题在，这是苏联代表团所提作为议程项目，大会所应该审议的。
    国民党集团代表蒋廷黻坚持延迟决定，因为美国尚未对福摩萨问题提出解释性的备忘录，也因为蒋廷黻尚未自其“国家”得到指示。
    马立克敦促立即作决定，并宣称：美国尚未提出备忘录不能作为延迟决定的理由。但奥斯汀允诺了蒋廷黻的请求，因而主席宣布：这个项目暂时撤销。英国代表杰伯同样提议缓期处理苏联的建议，他说苏联对美国的控诉性质不明确，而声言没有备忘录就不能采取决定。
    马立克说，备忘录是要提出的，但同时又说，对苏联提案迟迟不决是没有理由的，因为苏联的控诉是一项明白的问题，它是以美国对台湾的行动、对中国东北的轰炸以及其他也影响到中国的对远东的侵略行动为根据这一点是很明显的。
    马立克接受安迪让的建议，即苏联所提的这一项目，标题应改为以“控诉”一词开始。委员会继即接受英国的建议，对苏联所提的这一项目，暂不作决定。临时议程的审议至此结束，委员会宣布休会，九月二十二日晨再开。
