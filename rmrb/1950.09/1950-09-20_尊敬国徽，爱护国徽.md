　　Respect the National Emblem, Cherish the National Emblem

　　The design of the National Emblem of the People's Republic of China has been announced today by Chairman Mao through an order.

　　The National Emblem vividly represents the nature of our country – a people's democratic state led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance. It has been nearly a year since such a New China was founded. The Chinese people have driven out American imperialism from the mainland, victoriously carried out and are carrying out the struggle to eliminate feudalism, declared the demise of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, the general agent of imperialism and feudal forces in China, and formally established the People's Republic of China in September of last year. Our National Emblem is a symbol of the victory of such a New Democratic revolutionary struggle and the birth of New China.

　　Seeing the National Emblem, we can recall the heroic and arduous revolutionary struggles waged by the Chinese people to win today's victory, especially the New Democratic revolutionary struggles since the May Fourth Movement. On May 4, 1919, led by patriotic intellectuals with communist ideas, more than 5,000 students in Beijing held a grand rally and demonstration in front of Tiananmen Square, launching a great political struggle of the broad masses of people against imperialism and the traitorous government. The reactionary ruling class's arrests, massacres, and all kinds of suppression could not stop the people's surging patriotic enthusiasm. The broad working class, petty bourgeoisie, and national bourgeoisie all participated in this revolutionary movement. From then on, the Chinese people held high the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, and waged unyielding struggles against imperialism, feudal forces, and their running dogs, advancing wave upon wave. The parade and demonstration ranks of the people passed through Tiananmen Square countless times, each time getting closer to the final victory of the Chinese people. Finally, this Tiananmen, the magnificent and splendid building created by the blood, sweat, and wisdom of Chinese workers and peasants, belonged to the people. Finally, thirty years after the May Fourth Movement, a huge portrait of Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people, was hung high on this Tiananmen, becoming a reviewing stand for the Chinese people's revolutionary ranks. On October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China to the world from this reviewing stand.

　　Seeing this solemn and beautiful National Emblem, we cannot forget how many patriotic people and revolutionary martyrs have bravely given their blood and lives for the birth of the country symbolized by this National Emblem. It is their precious blood and lives that make our National Emblem shine with bright red and brilliant gold. The imperialists are still妄想ing to invade our territory, humiliate our people, and take away the happiness and freedom we have already gained. We must continue to make full preparations to defend our sacred and inviolable motherland.

　　Seeing this solemn and beautiful National Emblem, we also cannot forget the productive construction achievements made by our industrious and brave ancestors, the broad masses of workers and peasants, and all working people on the motherland, and the strength they have contributed to supporting national liberation and the people's liberation war. Now, our industrial and agricultural productive forces have been liberated from the shackles of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Each of us must contribute all our strength and wisdom, and participate in various production and construction undertakings with a high degree of patriotism, greatly improve productive forces, and build a brand-new industrial country.

　　Seeing this solemn and beautiful National Emblem, we also seem to see the vast number of people, abundant products, long history, and rich culture of China; and we can also imagine the infinitely bright and promising future of New China. China is no longer a humiliated, enslaved, declining, and impoverished country, but has become an independent and self-reliant country that is increasingly moving towards strength and happiness. Once the industrious and brave people become the masters of the country, the economic and cultural life of China will present a completely new face. The New China of people's democratic dictatorship has only been born for a year, and China has already made tremendous progress that people could not have predicted a year ago. The products of China will, through the efforts of the working people and people of all strata, increasingly bring more happiness to the people of the whole country. Moreover, as Chairman Mao said: "The era when Chinese people were considered uncivilized has passed, and we will appear in the world as a nation with a high degree of culture." China is such a vast, broad, rich, and complex country that realizing our ideal of grand goals will require a considerably long process. The National Emblem inspires us: we must strengthen the revolutionary great unity of the democratic classes and people of all ethnic groups with the working class as the backbone, consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, consolidate our established great and authoritative revolutionary united front, and move forward steadily.

　　The National Emblem design proposed by the First National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at its Second Session was approved by the Eighth Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee and announced today. The people of the whole country should abide by the measures for the use of the National Emblem stipulated by the Central People's Government, and should not abuse or misuse it; printed materials with the National Emblem design should not be discarded everywhere; the National Emblem design should not be used as decoration and embellishment for personal living rooms, nor should it be used as a mark and decoration for industrial and commercial goods.

　　The National Emblem, like the national flag, represents the dignity of our great People's Republic of China. Every patriotic people should respect the National Emblem, cherish the National Emblem, and defend the beloved motherland represented by the National Emblem. Whoever dares to invade our sacred motherland, we will resolutely wipe them out!

### 尊敬国徽，爱护国徽

　　尊敬国徽，爱护国徽
    中华人民共和国国徽图案已由毛主席以命令于今日公布。
    国徽鲜明地表现了我们国家的性质——工人阶级领导的以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家。这样的一个新中国成立已将近一年了。中国人民从大陆上赶出了美国帝国主义、胜利地进行了并进行着消灭封建主义的斗争，宣告了帝国主义与封建势力在中国的总代理者国民党反动政权的灭亡，在去年九月间正式建立了中华人民共和国。我们的国徽就是这样的新民主主义革命斗争的胜利与新中国诞生的象征。
    看到国徽，我们可以回想到中国人民为争取今日的胜利而进行了的英勇的艰苦的革命斗争，特别是“五四”以来的新民主主义革命斗争。一九一九年五月四日，在共产主义的爱国的知识分子领导下，北京学生五千余人曾在天安门前举行盛大集会和游行示威，掀起全国广大人民反对帝国主义、反对卖国政府的伟大政治斗争。反动统治阶级的逮捕、屠杀和一切镇压，都遏止不了人民高涨的爱国热情，广大工人阶级、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级都参加了这个革命运动。从那时起，中国人民就擎起了反帝反封建的大旗，前仆后继，向帝国主义、封建势力及其走狗进行了不屈不挠的斗争。人民群众的游行示威行列多少次从天安门前经过，每一次都更接近了中国人民的最后胜利。终于，这座天安门，中国工人、农民以血汗与智慧创造出来的伟大壮丽的建筑物属于了人民。终于，在“五四”的三十年后，这座天安门上，高悬起中国人民领袖毛泽东的巨像，成了中国人民革命队伍的检阅台。一九四九年十月一日，毛主席就在这座检阅台上向全世界宣告了中华人民共和国的成立。
    看到这个庄严美丽的国徽，我们就不能忘记多少爱国志士和革命先烈已经为这国徽所象征的国家的诞生而英勇地付出了他们的鲜血与生命。是他们的可贵的鲜血与生命，使我们的国徽发出鲜艳的红色和灿烂的金光。帝国主义者今天还在妄想侵犯我们的国土，凌辱我们的人民，夺去我们已经获得的幸福和自由。我们还要继续进行充分的准备，保卫我们神圣不可侵犯的祖国。
    看到这个庄严美丽的国徽，我们也不能忘记我们勤劳勇敢的先辈、广大工农和一切劳动人民在祖国大地上进行的生产建设的劳绩，和支援民族解放与人民解放战争所付出的力量。现在，我们的工农业生产力已从帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的桎梏下解放了出来，我们每一个人都要拿出全部力量与智慧，以高度的爱国主义的精神参加各项生产建设事业，把生产力大大提高一步，建设起一个崭新的工业国家。
    看到这个庄严美丽的国徽，我们也就像看到中国众多的人民、丰饶的物产、悠久的历史、丰富的文化；而且也可以想像到新中国无限远大的充满光辉的前程。中国再也不是一个屈辱的、受奴役的、衰败与贫困的国度，而成为一个独立自主的、日益走向强盛与幸福的国度。勤劳勇敢的人民一经做了国家的主人，中国的经济、文化生活就要出现一幅全新的面目。人民民主专政的新中国诞生不过一年，中国就已有了巨大的为一年前人们所预料不到的进展。中国的物产将经过劳动人民和各阶层人民的努力而日益为全国人民带来更多的幸福。而且，正如毛主席所说的：“中国人被人认为不文明的时代已经过去了，我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”中国是这样一个辽阔广大丰富复杂的国家，实现我们理想的远大目标，还要经过相当长的一个过程。国徽启示我们：必须加强以工人阶级为骨干的各民主阶级和各民族人民的革命大团结，巩固工农联盟，巩固我们已建立的伟大的有威信的革命统一战线，稳步前进。
    中国人民政协第一届全国委员会第二次会议所提出的国徽图案，经中央人民政府委员会第八次会议通过后今天公布了。全国人民应当遵守中央人民政府规定的国徽使用办法，不要滥用滥作；印有国徽图案的印刷品，不要随处抛弃；不要把国徽图案用作个人住室的陈设与点缀，也不要把国徽图案用作工商业品的标记与装饰。
    国徽和国旗同样代表着我们伟大的中华人民共和国的尊严，每个爱国的人民都要尊敬国徽，爱护国徽，保卫国徽所代表的可爱的祖国。谁敢来侵犯我们神圣的祖国，我们就坚决把它消灭！
