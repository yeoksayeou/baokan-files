Impressions of London (Part Two)
Soviet Union Ailunbao

　　Britain is currently experiencing one of the most turbulent and important periods in its history. Not long ago, people believed that the Labour government's policies were distinctly different from those of Mr. Truman, because Britain tempered American enthusiasm, recognized the new China, and criticized the anti-communist "crusade." It also differed from the United States in that it was peace-loving.
    This is a remarkable victory for hypocrites and a remarkable disappointment for the naive. Not long ago, the British peace movement was very weak. Now, people's eyes seem to be opening. At the National Peace Congress, I met many clergymen and Labour Party members, Quakers and representatives of intellectuals, who were far from being communists. This movement is growing among the masses, and it is no accident that many trade union representatives attended this conference. The movement also includes the elite of the intellectuals.
    I have spoken with some of the most famous British scholars; until recently, they stood on the side of supporting peace, but now they look around with suspicion - wondering if there is some kind of trap; however, honest people who love culture see the threat of war and are prepared to fight for peace. I think the behavior of the playwright Priestley is noteworthy: he thought back and forth, debated with himself, sought a way out, and became even more confused - in 1950 it is not easy to believe in the peace-loving nature of the British government, unless you are a newborn infant or a cynic. The excellent representatives of British intellectuals, people who are proud of national traditions, understand that the war fantasized by some greedy people in the United States would be fatal to Britain's small territory, to its large cities and concentrated industries that could be harmed by bombs. The movement to defend peace may become a truly national movement in Britain.
    Londoners of various tendencies have told me that the rally in Trafalgar Square was the largest gathering since the war. When I stood on the podium, I saw those people - men and women of all ages and all classes. At that moment, I understood that it was in vain for the newspapers to incite Londoners to oppose the people of Stalingrad: how warm this huge crowd was, this group of people welcomed the Soviet people...
    The characteristic of the British is that they rarely doubt. In France, you will see the questioning eyes of children who have not yet reached school age. In Britain, what always moves me deeply is the gray-haired old man with the innocent eyes of a child. However, the trust of the British is also limited. Although the newspapers portray the American military intervention in Korea as "combat operations by the United Nations forces," it is not very convincing. I have heard the same sarcastic remarks not only in the poor East End of London, but also in fashionable hotels: "The Americans have simply become useless soldiers... The Koreans have beaten them, you see!... They shouldn't be so arrogant..." In this gleeful tone there is many years of humiliation: the nouveau riche from Colorado (Note 2) tried to use a rein to pull the British lion and cut off its mane, and now this lion tamer has been driven to flee.
    A Labour MP asked me at the meeting I mentioned, "How can the Korean War be ended without damaging American prestige?" I don't know what the further meaning of this question is: is it concern for his partner, is it a witty remark, or is it a desire for peace. All British people understand: it is not the prestige of the American people that has been hit, but the prestige of the American government. However, many British people also understand another thing; Americans are not used to this kind of blow, because since they cannot suppress Korea, then they will be even less able to suppress China, although they have tried and worked hard. Therefore, many British people recall: British soldiers went to Baku, Novorossiysk, and Arkhangelsk to disturb Russia thirty years ago, and were also forced to return home. The failure of armed intervention in Russia was a blow to the prestige of some British politicians, but it was not the prestige of the British people that suffered.
    In Britain there is an organization called the "National Peace Committee"; which includes pacifists, Labour Party members, Liberal Party members, etc. Until recently, this organization sharply opposed the peace movement, saying that it "did not want to have anything in common with the communists." Two weeks ago, the "National Peace Committee" convened a meeting to discuss the Korean incident; almost all the speakers exposed the American armed intervention and demanded that Britain not participate in this sinful adventure. The approach of this organization to the peace movement is noteworthy - the increased war crisis has contributed to this situation.
    The number of people signing the Stockholm Appeal is growing, and now nearly one million British people have signed it. Readers who are not familiar with British life may say that this is not much. But I want to say that it is quite a lot. If we think that the newspapers have described the Stockholm Appeal as a communist manifesto, then this number is not small; if we think that the Labour Party has forbidden its members to sign the peace declaration and that the highest bishops in the church, the Archbishops of York and Canterbury, also oppose this document, then this number is not small.
    The demand to ban atomic weapons is a test of strength. British people have asked me more than once why peace advocates only condemn atomic weapons. I replied that this is only the first step. Now, people all over the world hope to stop the war in Asia, end the "cold war" launched by American diplomats, and establish lasting peace. The British people also hope for these things. Mr. Churchill in Britain is more of a figurehead than someone who can sway people's hearts. As for the Labour Party's leadership, it cannot resist American demands in the slightest: Mr. Truman gives the order, and Mr. Bevin tries his best not to make mistakes. At the same time, the newspapers' slander, the calls for "preventive war," and the propaganda of hatred have not penetrated the hearts of the British people; we should not believe the frenzy of the City of London, the ravings of the *Daily Mail*, or the *Daily Herald*'s false lamentations for the thoughts and feelings of the British people.
    Americans like to talk about their blood ties with the British: the prodigal son remembers his origins, but only to squander his father's property in a gamble for world hegemony. The British have been listening to this kind of talk for a long time, and there was a time when they were naively moved, but now they are saying, "Enough already?..." Perhaps this cannot be heard across the ocean - because the BBC will not broadcast these things; but the simple British people are talking about it... At a lecture in London, I said: "Russia has a very good proverb: 'Don't teach your grandmother to suck eggs.' We are now in a very strange and bad situation: the egg has been trying to teach the hen for years now, it even wants to command the hen. I know a little bit about British history, so I understand that this habit is intolerable for any British person - no matter what their views are. I firmly believe in the fairness of the proverb I quoted, and I am sure that the time when the hen tells the egg to behave itself is not far away."
    The planes are flying low over the city; the clusters of houses, the red dots of buses, the black and white dots of people on the sports field, all look like toys; this huge city, seen from the air, looks like a model, exquisite, neat, and painted. In reality, this city is not calm, it does not have the passion of the South, the banners of demonstrations in the streets and the noise, but its restraint should not be mistaken for humiliation and tolerance of surrender. The British people still have something to say, and I don't think what they say will suit Mr. Truman's taste.

　　伦敦的印象（下）
    苏联  爱伦堡
    英国现在正经历着英国历史上最动乱又最重要的一页。不久以前，人民还相信工党政府的政策是与杜鲁门先生的政策截然不同的，因为英国减低了美国人的热心，它承认了新中国，它还批评反共产主义者的“十字军”，同时它不同于美国的首先在于它是爱好和平的。
    这是伪善的人们的显著的胜利，同时又是天真的人们的显著的委屈，不久以前英国的和平运动还很微弱。现在人们的眼睛仿佛睁开了。在全国和平大会上，我遇见过许多教士与工党党员，教友派教徒和知识分子的代表，他们都远不是共产党员。这个运动在人民群众中增长着，同时许多工会代表出席这个大会也不是偶然的。这个运动也包括着知识分子的精华。
    我曾和英国一些最著名的学者谈过话；他们直到最近都站在拥护和平的方面，而现在他们怀疑地左顾右盼——看看这里边是否有什么圈套；然而，只要是爱好文化的诚实的人们，却就看到了战争的威胁，准备为和平而斗争。我觉得剧作家普利斯德莱的行为是值得指出的：他想来想去，自己与自己争辩，寻求出路，于是困惑得更厉害了——在一九五○年相信英国政府的爱好和平是不容易的，除非做一个新生的幼儿或是犬儒主义者。英国知识分子优秀的代表们，以民族传统自豪的人们，他们明白美国某些贪婪的家伙们所幻想的那个战争，对于英国不大的领土来说，对于可能被炸弹伤害的大都市及集中的工业来说是致命的。保卫和平运动，在英国可能成为真正全国性的运动。
    各种不同倾向的伦敦人们告诉我，在特法拉加广场的大会是战后最大的一次集会。当我站在讲坛上时，我看到了那些人民——各种年龄，各种阶层的男女们。那一刹时我明白了，报纸煽动伦敦人来反对斯大林格勒人民是白费劲的：这个巨大的人群多么的温暖，这一群人是欢迎苏维埃人民的……
    英国人的特性就是很少怀疑。在法国，你会看到未达学龄的儿童的疑问的目光。在英国，使我深刻感动的永远是那些有着儿童般天真的眼睛的灰发老人。然而，英国人的信赖性也有限度。报纸上虽然把美国在朝鲜的军事干涉行动说成“联合国军队的战斗行为”，但很少令人信服。我不仅在贫穷的伦敦东城，而且在时髦的大饭店中，都听到过同样的讥讽的话：“美国人简直成了不中用的军人了……朝鲜人把他们打了，你看！……他们不要目中无人……”在这种逞快的语气里有着许多年来的侮辱：科罗拉多（注二）的暴发户企图用缰绳拉住不列颠狮子割掉它的鬃毛，而现在这个驯养狮子的人却被赶得不得不逃跑了。
    一个工党议员，在我谈到过的那次会见时候问我道：“怎样结束朝鲜战争，才可以使美国人的威信不受损伤呢？”我不知道这个问题进一步的意思是什么：是关心自己的伙伴呢，是俏皮话呢还是渴望和平。一切英国人都明白：受到打击的并不是美国人民的威信，而是美国政府的威信。然而，许多英国人也明白另外一件事；美国人是不习惯这种打击的，因为他们既然不能镇压朝鲜，那么他们对于中国就更不能镇压了，虽然他们曾经尝试过，曾经努力过。因此许多英国人回忆起：英国士兵三十年前曾到巴库、到新俄罗斯克、到阿尔汉格尔斯克扰乱过，也是被迫得转回家的。武装干涉俄国的失败对某些英国政治家的威信是一种打击，但蒙受打击的并不是英国人民的威信。
    在英国有着“全国和平委员会”的组织；其中包含着和平主义者、工党党员、自由党员等。这个组织直到最近都是尖锐地反对拥护和平运动的，说是“不愿与共产党人有任何共同之处”。两星期以前，“全国和平委员会”召集了研讨朝鲜事件的会议；几乎全部出席讲话的人都揭露了美国的武装干涉并要求英国不要参加这个罪恶的冒险。这个组织与拥护和平运动的接近是可以指出的——增长了的战争危机促成了这样的情况。
    在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名的人数增长着，现在有近一百万英国人签了名。对英国生活不熟的读者会说，不多啊。我却要说，不少呢。如果我们想到各报把斯德哥尔摩宣言描写成了共产党的宣言，那么，这个数目是不算少的；如果我们想到工党曾经禁止它的党员在和平宣言上面签名以及教会中最高的主教、约克和坎特伯雷大主教也反对这个文件的话，那么这个数目是不算少的。
    禁止原子武器的要求，就是力量的考验。英国人不止一次地问我，和平拥护者为什么只限于谴责原子武器。我回答说这仅仅是第一个步骤。现在，各国人民都希望停止亚洲的战争，结束美国外交家所发动的“冷战”，而建立持久和平。英国人民也希望这些。邱吉尔先生在英国与其说是一个能左右人心的人，倒不如说是一个虚有其表的人物。至于工党的领导机关，它对于美国的要求是丝毫不能反抗的：杜鲁门先生吩咐下去，贝文先生就竭力想不犯错误。同时报纸的诽谤，进行“预防性战争”的号召，仇恨的宣传都没有深入英国的人心；我们不应听信伦敦城的热狂，《每日邮报》的谵语，或是《每日先驱报》对于英国人民思想与情感的虚伪的惋惜。
    美国人喜欢说到与英国人的血缘关系：荡子想起了自己的出身，不过是为了想在为世界霸权的赌博中荡尽父亲的家产。英国人听这种话听得很久了，而且有一个时候还天真地很受感动，但是现在他们已经说出这种话了：“够了吧？……”也许在海洋彼岸听不到这种话——因为“英国广播公司”是不会广播这些的；但英国纯朴的人民却谈论着……在伦敦的一次讲演会上，我说过：“俄国有一句很好的谚语：鸡蛋不要教训母鸡。我们现在却处在很奇怪很不好的情况中：鸡蛋试图教训母鸡已经不是第一年了，它甚至想命令母鸡。我稍稍知道一些英国的历史，因此我明白这种习性对于任何一个英国人来说——无论他抱着何种见解——都是不可忍受的。我深信我所引的这句谚语的公正，同时我确信，母鸡叫鸡蛋守规矩的时候已经是不远了。”
    飞机在都市上空低飞着；一群群的房屋，公共汽车的红色小点，运动场上人们的黑色与白色小点，这一切看起来都像是玩具似的；这个巨大的都市，从空中看起来活像一副模型，精巧、整齐而且涂着油漆。实际上这个都市并不沉静，它虽然没有南方的热情、街道上的示威旗帜和喧哗，却也不可把它的拘谨误认为屈辱与对投降的忍耐。英国人民还是要说话的，我不觉得他们所说的话就会合杜鲁门先生的脾胃。
