　　Zhejiang Cotton Harvest Unprecedented in a Decade
    Textile Company Branch Begins Purchasing
    Public-Private Joint Purchase Planned to Prevent Chaos
    [Our Dispatch] Zhejiang Province is celebrating an unprecedented cotton harvest this year. According to preliminary investigations, the yield is approximately 35 jin of ginned cotton per mu, which is not only more than double last year's yield, but also of much better quality than in previous years. The harvest period has also been advanced by half a month, which is unprecedented in a decade. The bumper cotton harvest provides a strong guarantee for the raw materials of the textile industry.

    In order to protect the interests of cotton farmers, develop agricultural production, and ensure the supply of industrial raw materials, the Hangzhou Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Company has decided to appropriately advance the purchase date.

    Currently, the cotton-producing areas of Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Hangxian have seen the new cotton enter the market earlier than other regions, so the purchase date is also earlier than in other places. The Gualipu cotton purchasing station opened on the 21st of last month, and 500 dan of seed cotton entered the market that day. On August 22nd, the opening day in Hangzhou, more than 100 dan of new cotton were also put on the market, and the amount is constantly increasing. Although the harvest period in Yuyao cotton fields is slightly later than in other places, the yield is particularly abundant. The area has more than 400,000 mu of cotton fields, each of which can produce about 40 jin of ginned cotton, and has begun to enter the market successively.

    The purchase price is based on the instructions of the Trade Department of the Central People's Government, with the principle of taking into account the interests of producers, transporters, and yarn mills, and with reference to the price ratio of grain and cotton, cotton yarn, and the cotton price in the marketing areas. On August 22nd, when the Gualipu cotton purchasing station opened, the price of coarse cotton seed cotton was 220,000 yuan per dan, and the price of coarse cotton ginned cotton was 660,000 yuan. From September 5th, the price of coarse cotton seed cotton was adjusted to 225,000 yuan, and the price of coarse cotton ginned cotton was adjusted to 675,000 yuan. The purchasing method is to adopt both direct purchasing and commissioned purchasing by cooperatives in key producing areas. In order to avoid and prevent mutual competition and chaotic prices, a public-private joint purchasing plan is being organized to facilitate unified leadership and control.

    In order to cooperate with the allocation of purchase funds to the countryside and ensure the supply of farmers' necessities, the China National Grain Provincial Company, the Native Produce Provincial Company, the General Merchandise Provincial Company, and local cooperatives have cooperated with the purchasing stations in various places to supply farmers with cheap food, industrial products, and fertilizers. The procedures at the cotton purchasing stations in various places are simple, and the prices are fair, so the cotton farmers are all happy. Not only are those who sell cotton quite enthusiastic, but the quantity is also increasing day by day. On the first day of purchasing at the Gualipu purchasing station, more than 8,600 jin were collected. Most of the farmers use the proceeds from the sale of cotton to purchase daily necessities and means of production, and the purchase of fertilizer is particularly large.

　　浙江棉花丰收十年来所罕见
    花纱布分公司开始收购
    正计划组织公私联购防止混乱
    【本报讯】浙江省今年棉花喜庆丰收。据初步调查，每亩可产皮棉三十五斤左右，不仅产量较去年增加达一倍以上，品质亦较往年好得多，产期也提早了半个月，这是十年来所罕见的。由于棉花的丰收，对纺织工业的原料提供了有力的保证。
    中国花纱布公司杭州分公司为了维护棉农利益，发展农业生产，以及保证工业原料供应起见，特决定将收购日期酌予提早。
    目前萧山、绍兴、杭县等产棉地区，新棉登场比其他各地尤早，故收购日期亦在他地之前，瓜沥收花处于上月二十一日开秤，当日即有五百担籽花登场；杭州八月二十二日开秤那天，亦有一百多担新花上市，且在不断增加中。余姚棉田产期虽较他地稍迟，但产量尤丰，当地有棉田四十余万亩，每亩可产皮棉达四十斤左右，并已开始陆续登场。
    收购价格系根据中央人民政府贸易部指示，以照顾生产者、贩运者、纱厂三方面利益为原则，及参照了粮棉、花纱比价与销区棉价所订定的。瓜沥收花处粗绒籽花每担八月二十二日开秤时为二十二万元，粗绒皮棉为六十六万元。九月五日起粗绒籽花调整至二十二万五千元，粗绒皮棉调整至六十七万五千元。在收购方式上是采取直接收购及在重点产区委托合作社代购两种。为了避免和防止互相竞争，混乱价格起见，正在计划组织公私联合采购，以便统一领导和掌握。
    为了配合收购资金下乡，保证农民必需品的供应，中国粮食省公司、土产省公司，百货省公司与各地合作社等已配合各地收购站，以廉价的食米、工业品、肥料等供给农民。各地收花站手续简便，价格公道，棉农莫不欢欣，不但投售者相当踊跃，而数量也与日俱增，瓜沥收购站开始收购的第一天，即达八千六百余斤。大部农民将售棉所得，一部分购买日用品和生产资料，购买肥田粉的是特别多。
