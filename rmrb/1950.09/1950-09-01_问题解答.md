　　Question and Answer

　　Question: Can cooperatives make a profit? If they can make a profit, how should these profits be distributed?
                        (Asked by Zhang Wenbing)
　　Answer: First of all, it must be recognized that the basic purpose of a cooperative is to avoid the intermediate exploitation of small producers and direct consumers by merchants, rather than to make money and distribute dividends, and not to pursue profits. However, on the other hand, in order for a cooperative to exist and develop, and in order to be able to provide more services to its members, it should not lose money, and should also obtain legitimate and reasonable profits. Therefore, it is not only permissible for a cooperative to make a profit, but it is also completely appropriate and necessary; the question is whether the profit it obtains is legitimate and reasonable.
　　In order for a cooperative to obtain legitimate and reasonable profits, it must operate in accordance with the state's plan and implement the price policies stipulated by the state. This is the first point. Second, the source of a cooperative's legitimate and reasonable profits should not be based on exploiting producers or consumers, nor should it be based on taking advantage of the state; it must rely on improving the cooperative's own operations and management, and striving for streamlining and economy; establishing and strictly implementing an economic accounting system.
　　How to appropriately distribute the profits obtained by the cooperative is a question of great practical significance. The distribution of these profits should first be used to consolidate and develop the cooperative enterprise. Generally, when a cooperative has a surplus at the end of the year, it should refer to the following standards to make a surplus distribution plan, submit it to the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting for discussion and approval, and report it to the higher-level cooperative for approval:
　　1. The public reserve fund shall not be less than 60%;
　　2. 10% shall be paid to the higher-level cooperative construction fund;
　　3. The public welfare fund shall not exceed 10%;
　　4. The education fund for cooperative cadres and members shall be 5%;
　　5. The dividend on shares shall not exceed 15%.
　　For the surplus distribution of production cooperatives, the public reserve fund shall not be less than 40%; the labor return shall not exceed 40%; other items shall be allocated with reference to the above-mentioned items 2, 3, and 4. The calculation standard of the labor return shall be determined by the members' meeting or the members' representative meeting in a democratic manner according to the quality and quantity of labor or the proportion of annual wage income.

　　问题解答
    问：合作社可以获取利润吗？如果它可以获取利润，那么这些利润应当怎样分配呢？
                        （张文炳提）
    答：首先必须认识，合作社的基本目的，在于避免商人对于广大小生产者和直接消费者的中间剥削，而不是在于赚钱分红，不在追逐利润。但另一方面，合作社为了自己的存在与发展，为了有可能为社员群众更多服务，亦不应使自己赔本，而且还应取得正当合理的利润。因此，合作社之取得利润就不仅是可以允许的，而且是完全应当和必要的；问题只是它所获得的利润是否正当和合理。
    合作社要获取正当而合理的利润，必须按照国家的计划去经营，必须执行国家所规定的价格政策，这是第一；第二，合作社获得正当合理利润的来源，不是依靠剥削生产者或消费者，也不是依靠占了国家的“便宜”；而必须是依靠改善合作社自己的经营与管理，力行精简节约；建立并严格执行经济核算制度。
    合作社所获利润应该如何适当地分配，是一个具有重大实际意义的问题。这些利润的分配，应当首先用于巩固与发展合作社事业。一般合作社，于年终决算有盈余时，应参照下列标准，作成盈余分配案，提交社员大会或社员代表大会讨论通过，并报请上级社核准分配之：
    一、公积金不得少于百分之六十；
    二、缴上级社合作社建设基金百分之十；
    三、公益金不超过百分之十；
    四、合作社干部及社员教育基金百分之五；
    五、股金分红不超过百分之十五。
    生产合作社的盈余分配，其公积金不得少于百分之四十；劳动返还金不得超过百分之四十；其他参照上述二、三、四等项标准酌予分配。劳动返还金之计算标准，按照劳动的质与量或全年工资所得比例，由社员大会或社员代表大会以民主方式评定之。
