　　Shanxi's Experience in Purchasing Cotton Last Year
    Correctly Grasping Prices to Expand Cotton Planting; Implementing Unified Leadership to Prevent Chaos
    [Our Newspaper News] According to the Shanxi Daily's August 19th report: Since the Shanxi Provincial Production and Sales Conference in mid-September last year, the central task of vigorously purchasing raw cotton to supply urban industrial needs, combined with promoting the sales of industrial products to meet farmers' demands, was carried out. By the end of May this year, the task was overfulfilled, and some experience was gained. First, grasping cotton prices well and ensuring the sales of cotton is the decisive key to stimulating cotton farmers to expand cotton fields. For example, in the Fenyang Special District, the price of one jin of cotton was consistently maintained above eight jin of millet. At the same time, the purchase by the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, cooperatives, and private merchants never stopped; therefore, it encouraged farmers' enthusiasm for planting cotton. This spring, the entire district planted 280,000 mu, exceeding last year's 150,000 mu by 86 percent. Another example is Jinnan, where prices were once low and administrative control was too strict, making it difficult for farmers to sell cotton, which caused farmers to have many concerns when planting cotton this spring. For example, in Hongtong and Jie counties, sorghum was interplanted in cotton fields, preparing to plow the cotton and leave the sorghum if the government does not purchase it in the future. Second, simultaneously with the purchase, it is necessary to combine with fraternal companies to provide support in kind. When prices fluctuate, cotton farmers mostly demand physical goods (such as wheat, cloth, etc.), and when prices are stable, they mostly want currency. If sufficient preparations are made to ensure that the masses have goods when they want goods and money when they want money, the completion of the purchase task and the stability of prices can be guaranteed. Third, the participating purchasing units must have unified leadership and unified prices and specifications to avoid confusion caused by differences in practices or even blind competition. In order to ensure the quality of cotton, educating farmers on specifications is a serious and necessary task, and repeated publicity and explanation are needed; at the same time, cotton purchasing cadres must improve their own cotton identification technology and strictly control grade prices in order to achieve the dual tasks of meeting industrial requirements and stimulating cotton farmers' enthusiasm.

　　山西收购去年棉花经验
    正确掌握价格才能扩大植棉  实行统一领导才能防止混乱
    【本报讯】据山西日报八月十九日消息：自去年九月中旬，在山西全省产销会议上，确定大力收购原棉，供给城市工业需要，结合推销工业品，满足农民要求的中心工作进行以后，到今年五月底，即超额完成了任务，并摸索出一些经验。首先，掌握好棉价，保证棉花销路，是刺激棉农扩大棉田的决定关键。如汾阳专区在收购中，始终保持一斤棉八斤小米以上的价格，同时花纱布公司、合作社、私商的收购，从未间断；因此鼓励了农民植棉的情绪。今年春季全区播种达二十八万亩，超过去年十五万亩的百分之八十六。又如晋南因一度价格偏低与行政管制过严，农民售花困难，便造成今春植棉时农民顾虑丛生。如洪洞、解县将棉田中加种高粱，预备将来政府不收时，将棉花犁去剩下高粱。其次，与收购同时，必须结合兄弟公司以实物作支持，因物价波动时棉农多要求实物（如小麦、布匹等），物价平稳时多要货币；如果充分准备，做到群众要货有货、要款有款，才能保证收购任务完成与物价的稳定。再次，参加收购单位必须统一领导，统一价格及规格，才能避免因作法分歧，甚至盲目竞购，而引起的混乱现象。为了保证棉花质量，对农民进行规格教育，是严重而必要的任务，需要反复的进行宣传解释；同时收花干部要提高本身识棉技术，严格掌握等级价格，才能达到适应工业要求和刺激棉农情绪的双重任务。
