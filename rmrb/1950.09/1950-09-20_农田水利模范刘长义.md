Model Agricultural Irrigation Worker Liu Changyi

　　Liu Changyi is from Nanliang Village, Seventh District, Pingyao County, Shanxi Province. He is 44 years old this year, a member of the Communist Party, and currently serves as the Deputy Chairman and Production Director of the village People's Government. Because of his consistently active and responsible attitude towards water conservancy work, his patient persuasion of the masses, his changes to the unreasonable feudal water system, and his resolution of long-standing water disputes in nearby villages; and his mobilization of the masses to reclaim long-abandoned sandy land, increasing the income of the masses, he has won the love of the masses and was honorably elected as a representative to the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers.

　　I. Abolishing the Feudal Water Regulations and Implementing Economical Water Use

　　Nanliang Village is the first village on the Yongji embankment of the Fen River, and has always controlled the water route. Wang Lisheng, a feudal landlord in the village, was related to a rich peasant in Xiliang Village. Therefore, every year after watering his fields, he would release the water to Xiliang Village. In 1933, the village built the embankment. Because the downstream villages did not contribute money, the village, under the control of Wang Lisheng, deliberately did not build the embankment the following year, causing the river water to overflow and flood more than ten villages, including Xiliang Village, Dujia Village, and Zhangzhao Village. Every year after Nanliang Village finished watering its fields, it would rather release the water into the wasteland than let Yan Changtou water his fields. Yan Changtou also often stole water, and there were frequent lawsuits, causing great disunity.

　　This year, the Pingyao County People's Government, in order to reform the feudal water regulations, expand paddy fields, and increase agricultural production, planned to implement new water use methods on the Fen River, so as to achieve rational water use by irrigating in sequence according to the topography and terrain. Therefore, before the watering season, it convened a meeting of water conservancy cadres from various villages on the Yongji embankment to study the matter. It was believed that to implement the new water use method, it must first start with Nanliang Village, so it specifically invited Liu Changyi, the production director of the village, to participate. At the meeting, a new water use method was proposed. After much research and discussion, it was decided to let Yanchangtou Village (which is higher in elevation than Nanliang Village) irrigate first, and Nanliang Village irrigate later.

　　After Liu Changyi returned to the village, he immediately convened a meeting of cadres and a meeting of the masses to explain the plan for rational water use. At first, most cadres and the masses could not understand it and resisted the idea. But he was not discouraged. He repeatedly and patiently persuaded them, and explained the benefits of the new water use method to the masses on various occasions, such as on the river beach and at the construction site (building the village embankment). He said, "This year, let Yanchangtou water their fields first and then we will water ours. Opening the water at Wangjiafen and going downhill will be very smooth. According to our terrain, we are sure to be able to water our fields and save time. This way, the downstream villages can also water their fields, and the rotation will definitely be faster, which will benefit our village. At the same time, this will save them from building a second embankment, and our village will save on opening a water inlet. In the past, the two villages often had disputes, and they often stole our water, which was detrimental to our village. In the future, we will water their fields for them, and it would be so much better for the two villages to be friendly." After his repeated persuasion and mobilization, and because of his past leadership in water conservancy construction for the benefit of the masses, the masses trusted him very much, and most of them agreed to this water use plan.

　　Because he worked and attended meetings every day, and ran around in all directions, he fell ill during the watering season, but he did not rest. He guarded the embankment day and night, ensuring that the watering was carried out in an orderly manner. Under his active and responsible leadership, Yanchangtou irrigated more than 3,700 mu of land in two days, which was 2,000 mu more than last year, and could increase grain production by more than 1,000 dan. This village irrigated 3,100 mu, which was 300 mu more than last year, and could increase grain production by more than 150 dan. It also saved a day's time. It is estimated that it can irrigate 60 to 70 mu more of land in the downstream villages, save the construction of two earthen embankments and two water inlets, save 500 to 600 man-days, and save more than 1,600 cubic meters of earthwork. More importantly, it eliminated the past antagonism between Nanliang Village and Yanchangtou Village. The masses unanimously reflected that this watering method was good. In particular, the masses in Yanchangtou Village expressed their strong support for Liu Changyi, saying, "If it weren't for Yang'er (Liu Changyi's nickname) giving us the idea, we wouldn't be able to water so much land."

　　Under the spirit of unity and mutual assistance of the masses, the unreasonable feudal old regulations were abolished, water was saved, and the irrigated area was expanded. Under the influence of this rational water use method, more than 50 villages downstream, such as Xiliang Village and Dongliang Village, followed suit. This new water use system can save more than six days of water flow and irrigate more than 50,000 mu of land.

　　II. Leading the Masses to Build Embankments

　　Last winter, when building the Yongji embankment, in order to complete it early and avoid freezing, and to solve the difficulties in life for other villages with less land and more people, he mobilized the masses to work on the embankment. At that time, the masses were hesitant because they were afraid of delaying the watering season. After his patient mobilization, 94 people were mobilized to work for a month, which enabled the completion of the large embankment ahead of schedule, and earned more than 23,000 jin of grain as wages. After paying the water fee, more than 10,000 jin of grain remained, which solved the living problems of the poor households. This spring, when repairing the Nanliang Village canal embankment, the masses were very anxious because they were afraid of delaying the water intake time. They complained that he should not have taken all the people from the village to work on the large embankment last winter. In order to complete the canal embankment project on time and ensure that the land was watered, in addition to mobilizing all the male labor force in the village to participate, he also mobilized more than 30 women, who worked more than 500 man-days, and completed the project on time, so that the irrigation could proceed smoothly. In order to save manpower and for long-term planning, he planned to build the Nanliang Village active embankment into a fixed embankment (in the past, active embankments were discarded every year after use, and rebuilt when water was needed in the second year). After he repeatedly explained this plan to the masses and obtained their consent, three fixed embankments were completed from last year to this year, saving 300 man-days each year.

　　III. Leading the Masses to Reclaim Wasteland

　　Nanliang Village is close to the Fen River, and there are more than 200 mu of wasteland on the river bank, which has been abandoned for many years and no one cultivates it. Last year, in order to respond to the government's call, he mobilized the masses to reclaim the beach. At that time, the masses were afraid that the land would be flooded if it was reclaimed, and their efforts would be wasted, so they were unwilling to reclaim it. He explained to the masses by calculating the accounts, saying, "At least one and a half dan of grain can be harvested from one mu of reclaimed land, and it is worthwhile even if only one crop is harvested in three years." After his repeated persuasion and mobilization, more than 30 mu were reclaimed last spring, and more than 40 dan of grain were harvested in the autumn. This spring, the remaining more than 170 mu were also reclaimed. But in early summer, the river water rose sharply, and these fields were flooded. The sorghum hearts were filled with mud and could not grow. He was very anxious when he discovered this. Later, he learned that if the sorghum was cut off together with the spikes and the mud, it could grow new tops. After he returned to the village, he immediately mobilized the masses to do so. After a few days, the new tops of the sorghum did grow, and spikes appeared.

　　Comrade Liu Changyi's model deeds are many. But every piece of his work relies on the masses, patiently persuading the masses in various ways, and influencing others with his own practical actions. The masses have benefited under his leadership, so they all admire and trust him very much.

　　农田水利模范刘长义
    刘长义是山西平遥县七区南良庄人，今年四十四岁，共产党员，现任村人民政府副主席兼生产主任。由于他一贯对水利工作积极负责，耐心说服群众，改变了不合理的封建使水制度，解决了附近村庄长期的水利纠纷；又发动群众把久已荒芜的沙地开垦出来，增加了群众收入。因而获得了群众的爱戴，光荣的当选了出席全国工农兵劳模代表大会的代表。
    一、废除封建水规实行经济用水
    南良庄是汾河永济埝上第一个村庄，过去一贯把持水程。该村的封建地主王立胜和西良庄的一个富农是亲戚，故每年浇完地就把水放给西良庄。一九三三年该村筑了埝，因下游村庄没摊钱，第二年该村就在王立胜把持下故意不筑埝，让河水出岸，将西良庄、杜家庄、张赵等十余村淹了。南良庄每年浇完地后，宁把水放到荒滩里也不叫阎长头浇地，阎长头也常偷水，经常打官司，闹得很不团结。
    今年，平遥县人民政府为了改革封建水规，扩大水田，增加农业生产，拟在汾河上实行新的使水办法，做到按地形地势的顺次浇灌，达到用水合理化。因此在浇地以前，便在永济埝上召集各村水利干部，开会研究，认为要实行新的使水办法，必须先从南良庄开始，所以特别吸收该村生产主任刘长义参加。会议上提出新的使水办法，经过多方研究与讨论后，遂决定让阎长头村（地势较南良庄为高）先浇，南良庄后浇。
    刘长义回村后，马上召开了干部会和群众会，说明合理用水的计划，起初大部分干部与群众都想不通，思想上发生抵抗，但也并不灰心，再三耐心说服，并在河滩上、工地里（筑村埝）等各种场合里，向群众说明新使水办法的好处。他说：“今年叫阎长头先浇了地咱再浇，从王家坟开口一溜下坡很顺利；按咱的地形说，保险一定能浇，还会省时间，这样下游也可以浇了，轮的一定快，与咱村有利。同时，这也省得他村打二道埝，咱村省得开水口。以前两村时常闹纠纷，他村常偷咱的水，与咱村不利，今后咱给他浇了地，两村和和气气的有多好呢？”经过他三番五次的说服动员，以及他在过去带领群众兴修水利，为群众谋利益的影响，群众对他十分信任，大部分群众就同意了这个使水计划。
    他因每日做工开会，四下奔跑，在浇地时，生了病也不休息，日夜看守堤埝，保证了有秩序地进行浇地。在他积极负责领导下，结果用了两天时间给阎长头浇了三千七百多亩地，比去年多浇了二千亩，可增产粮食一千余石；本村浇了三千一百亩，比去年多浇三百多亩，可增产粮食一百五十多石；节省了一天时间。估计能多浇下游村的六、七十亩地，少筑两条土埝，两个开水口，节省人工五、六百个，节省一千六百余土方。更重要的是消除了过去南良庄与阎长头村对立的情况。群众一致反映这种浇地办法好，特别是阎长头群众对刘长义表示十分拥护，都说：“不是人家羊儿（刘长义小名）给咱出主意，咱们可浇不了这么多的地。”
    在群众这种团结互助的精神下，废除了不合理的封建旧规，节省了水量，扩大了浇地面积。在这种合理使水办法的影响下，下游西良庄、东良庄等五十余村都照着这样作。这一新的使水制度，共可节省水程六天多，可多浇地五万余亩。
    二、领导群众修筑堤坝
    去冬筑永济埝时，为了提早完成，避免上冻；解决他村地少人多生活上的困难，他便发动群众上埝做工。当时群众怕误了浇地表示犹豫，经他耐心动员，结果发动了九十四人做工一个月，使大埝提前完成，并赚了工资米二万三千余斤，除交清水费外，还剩米一万余斤，解决了贫苦户的生活问题。当今春修筑南良庄渠埝时，群众怕误了接水时间，十分着急，埋怨他去冬不该把村里的人都带去做大埝。他为了准时完成渠埝工程，保证把地浇完，除发动了全村男劳力参加外，并发动了三十多名妇女，做工五百多个，准时完成了工程，顺利地进行了浇灌。为了节省人力，从长期打算，他计划把南良庄的活埝筑成死埝（以前活埝每年用完就不要了，到第二年用水时重修），经他把这计划向群众再三说明，取得了群众同意后，从去年到今年完成了三条死埝，每年可省工三百个。
    三、带领群众开垦荒滩
    南良庄村靠近汾河，河岸有二百多亩荒地，已荒芜多年，无人耕种。去年他为了响应政府号召，便发动群众开滩。当时群众怕开出来被水淹了，白费工夫，不愿开。他又用算账的办法给群众解释说：“开出来一亩地至少能打一石五斗粮食，就是三年收上一季也是合算的”。经他再三说服动员，结果去春开了三十多亩，秋天打了四十多石粮食；今春又把剩下的一百七十余亩也开出来了。但到初夏季，河水大涨，这些地被淹了，泥土灌了高粱心不能生长，他发觉后十分着急，后来知道把高粱连稍连泥一起剪去，还能重新出顶生长。他回村后即发动群众这样做，过了几天，高粱新顶果然长起来了，并出了穗。
    刘长义同志的模范事迹是很多的。但他的每件工作，都是依靠群众，多方耐心说服群众，并以自己的实干行动来影响别人，群众在他的领导下得到了利益，所以对他都十分敬佩和信任。
