　　Lessons Learned from White Sugar Price Fluctuations Over the Past Three Months
　　Shen Yang, Price Section Chief, Domestic Trade Department, Central Trade Ministry
　　In the past three months, there have been two nationwide price fluctuations and increases in white sugar prices. The first started on June 25th. Due to the outbreak of the Korean War and the impact of Truman's statement, private merchants generally estimated that the supply of sugar would become increasingly difficult. In addition, the peak sales season for white sugar in summer had arrived. Thus, unscrupulous merchants began to snap up and hoard goods in the market. The price of white sugar started to rise continuously from Shanghai until it stabilized around July 20th. If we take the price on June 24th as 100, the price increase indices in major cities by July 20th were as follows:
    Beijing      Tianjin          Shanghai          Hankou          Guangzhou
    190.1       159.3            181.3            159.6            163.4
　　The five major markets saw an average increase of 70.5 percent in twenty-five days.

　　From July 20th to August 20th, white sugar prices in various regions were generally stable. However, starting from August 20th, as the Mid-Autumn Festival approached, unscrupulous merchants once again engaged in large-scale activities, leading to a second nationwide increase in sugar prices. From August 20th to the end of August, the average increase in the five major markets of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangzhou was 19.9 percent, with Tianjin experiencing the largest increase, reaching 35 percent.

　　From the start of the first fluctuation in late June to the second fluctuation at the end of August, the average price increase in the five major markets nationwide was 1.25 times. Tianjin experienced the highest increase, reaching 1.62 times.

　　To ensure the needs of legitimate pastry and confectionery industries and citizens before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the state-owned China National Merchandise Corporation imported several tons of white sugar from abroad to stabilize sugar prices and give speculative sugar merchants a necessary lesson. It adopted a policy of large-scale supply in the market at a level slightly lower than the market price. As a result, sugar prices began to decline in early September. From the end of August to September 15th, the average price decrease in the five major markets was 17.3 percent. Tianjin, which had experienced the largest increase, saw the most significant drop, reaching 33.3 percent.

　　The white sugar price changes over the past three months provide the following lessons:

　　1.  We must constantly pay attention to the activities of speculative capital in the market: The fluctuations in white sugar prices demonstrate that speculative factors are still present in the market. For example, the Tianjin Department Store typically sells an average of about 14,000 jin of white sugar per day, but when sugar prices fluctuated, daily sales reached 160,000 to 170,000 jin. This reflects the phenomenon of panic buying in the market. Therefore, state-owned trading organizations should be highly vigilant and must prevent situations similar to the recent white sugar price fluctuations from occurring.

　　2.  State-owned trading organizations should strengthen the planning and foresight in their business operations: The sugar price fluctuations indicate that state-owned trading organizations failed to adjust supply and demand in a timely manner to stabilize prices, which demonstrates that they did not have a sufficient grasp of commodity supply and demand and seasonal conditions. Therefore, they could not have planned and foreseen adjustments to supply and demand, indicating a certain degree of blindness in business operations. For example, the Tianjin Department Store originally planned to have 2 million jin of sugar, which would have been enough to solve the summer sugar supply problem. However, the Central Trade Ministry ended up allocating 10 million jin, which was still not enough to meet market demand, five times more than the original plan. This also shows that our trade cadres are careless in their work and have a low level of business proficiency. In the future, we must strengthen the investigation and statistical work on production, sales, supply, and demand conditions to overcome blindness in our work and avoid unnecessary losses.

　　3.  Regional price differences must be adjusted reasonably: Large regional price differences are also a factor contributing to the rise in sugar prices. For example, in early July, sugar prices in Shanghai and Hankou rose first, higher than prices in Beijing and Tianjin. At that time, the north-south difference was too large. For example, on July 3rd, the price of granulated sugar in Shanghai was 850,000 yuan per 100 jin, while the selling price in Hankou was 660,000 to 700,000 yuan, and the selling price in Beijing and Tianjin was only 500,000 to 550,000 yuan. Merchants from Shanghai and Hankou took the opportunity to come to Beijing and Tianjin to purchase and transport sugar, causing a significant fluctuation in the northern market. Similar situations occurred in early September. This is also something we should pay attention to and improve in our future work.

　　从三个月来白糖价格的变化得到的教训
    中央贸易部国内贸易司物价科长  沈扬
    近三个月来白糖价格曾发生了两次全国性的波动上涨。第一次是从六月二十五日开始，由于朝鲜战争的爆发及杜鲁门声明影响，一般私商估计食糖来源将益加困难，再加夏季白糖实销季节已到，奸商遂在市场抢购囤积，白糖价格就从上海开始不断上升，直至七月二十日方趋稳定。如以六月二十四日价格为一○○，至七月二十日各大城市上升指数如下：
    北京      天津          上海          汉口          广州一九○·一    一五九·三    一八一·三    一五九·六    一六三·四
    五大市场二十五天来平均上涨了百分之七十点五。
    自七月二十日至八月二十日各地白糖价格总的是平稳的。但自八月二十日开始，由于中秋节将届，奸商又大肆活动，发生了第二次全国性的糖价上涨。自八月二十日至八月底，京、津、沪、汉、穗五大市场平均上升了百分之十九点九，其中以天津上升幅度最大，达百分之三十五。
    从六月下旬第一次波动开始，至八月底第二次波动，全国五大市场平均竟上涨了一点二五倍，其中以天津上升最多，竟高达一点六二倍。
    国营中国百货公司为保证中秋节前一般正当糕点业，糖果业及市民需要，曾先后自国外输入白糖若干吨，以稳定糖价并给投机糖商以必要教训，在市场上采取稍低于市价的水平大量供应。因此，自九月初开始，糖价随即下垂，自八月底起至九月十五日止，五大市场平均下落了百分之十七点三，以上升最多的天津下落最猛，达百分之三十三点三。
    三个月来的白糖价格变化，可以得到以下几点教训：
    一、必须时刻注意市场上投机资本的活动：从这次白糖价格的波动来看，说明了市场上潜伏着的投机因素还是存在的。如天津百货公司平时每天平均只能销售白糖一万四千斤左右，但当糖价波动时每日竟销达十六、七万斤。这反映出市场上的抢购现象。因此国营贸易机构应该提起高度警惕，必须事先防止类似此次白糖价格波动的情况发生。
    二、国营贸易机构应加强业务经营上的计划性与预见性：从这次糖价波动来看，国营贸易机构未能及时的调节供求，以稳定物价，就说明了国营贸易机构对商品的供求情况和季节情况掌握不够。因此就不可能有预见的有计划的调剂供求，说明在业务经营上还存在着一定的盲目性。例如天津百货公司原计划有二百万斤糖，就可以解决夏季食糖供应，但结果由中央贸易部调去了一千万斤，尚不敷市场需要，与原计划竟差五倍之多。这也说明了我们贸易干部工作上的粗枝大叶，业务水平尚低，今后必须加强对产销供求情况的调查统计工作，以克服工作上的盲目性，避免不必要的损失。
    三、要把地区差价调整合理：地区间差价过大，也是促使糖价上涨的因素之一。例如七月初由于沪、汉糖价先涨，高于京、津价格。当时南北差额过大，如七月三日上海砂糖每百斤八十五万元，汉口售价六十六万至七十万元，京、津售价仅五十万至五十五万元，沪、汉商人便乘机来京、津购运，造成北方市场的较大波动。九月初也曾发生类似情况，这也是我们在今后工作上应该注意改进的。
