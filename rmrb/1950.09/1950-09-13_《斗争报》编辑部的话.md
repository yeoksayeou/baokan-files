Words from the Editorial Department of "Struggle"
    Stalin
    This article is the editorial of the first issue of "Struggle," an illegal newspaper of the Caucasus Tiflis Social Democratic organization published in Baku, founded by Stalin. The original text is in Georgian (formerly translated as Georgian), and the Russian translation can be found in the first volume of "The Complete Works of Stalin," published by the Soviet National Political Book Publishing Bureau in 1946. In this editorial, Stalin gave important instructions on the principles of revolutionary newspaper work, such as that newspapers should strive to become the leading center of the working masses and the masses of the people, pay attention to the domestic political situation and every social phenomenon and give Marxist explanations and criticisms, and establish close ties with readers.
                  ——Editor
    We are deeply convinced that free periodicals are an urgent issue for conscious Georgian readers; we are deeply convinced that this issue must be resolved today, and any further delay will only harm the common cause; we are deeply convinced that conscious readers will greet this publication with satisfaction and provide it with various kinds of assistance from their own side—we, a group of Georgian revolutionary Social Democrats, will meet this need and do our best to satisfy the readers' wishes. We are publishing the first issue of Georgia's first free newspaper, "Struggle."
    In order for readers to have a certain understanding of our publications, especially of ourselves, let us say a few words.
    The Social Democratic movement has not left any corner of our country untouched. Even this corner of Russia, which we call the Caucasus, has not been spared, and along with the Caucasus, our Georgia has not been spared either. The Social Democratic movement in Georgia is still a recent phenomenon, only a few years old, or more precisely, the foundation of this movement was laid in 1896. As everywhere, the initial work here did not go beyond the scope of secret activities. Agitation and extensive propaganda, as we have recently seen, were impossible at that time, and whether willing or not, all forces had to be concentrated in a few groups. Now this period has passed, Social Democratic ideas have spread among the working masses, and the work has moved out of its narrow secret activity and seized a large part of the workers. Open struggle has begun. The struggle has presented many questions to the first batch of workers that were previously buried and there was no great need to explain them. The question was raised sharply first: What means do we have to expand the struggle more widely? It is simple and easy to answer this question orally. But in fact, what is obtained is completely another matter.
    Needless to say, widely publicizing and agitating revolutionary ideas is the main means for the organized movement of Social Democrats. However, the conditions in which revolutionaries have to operate are so contradictory, so difficult, and require such great sacrifices that neither propaganda nor agitation can often become impossible, as needed in the early stages of the movement.
    Learning with the help of books and pamphlets in groups has become impossible, firstly because of the police situation, and secondly because of the handling of things themselves. Agitation work slackened under the first arrests. Contact with workers and frequent visits to workers gradually became impossible, but the workers were waiting for explanations of many urgent questions. The workers are surrounded by cruel struggles, and the government uses all its strength to oppose them. They have no way to critically treat the current environment, they have no materials on the essence of things, and often a small failure in a nearby factory is enough to discourage revolutionary-minded workers and lose confidence in the future, and the leaders have to re-attract them to participate in the work.
    It is rarely effective to carry out agitation with the help of pamphlets that only answer certain specific questions. It becomes necessary to create works that answer daily questions. Let us not prove this truth that everyone knows. The time has come in the Georgian workers' movement: periodical publications have become one of the most important means of revolutionary work.
    Regarding legal newspapers, we think it is necessary to say a few words for the reference of some inexperienced readers. If any worker thinks that legal newspapers, no matter under what circumstances they are published, no matter what their direction, are always the expression of the interests of the workers, then we think this is a big mistake. In a government that "cares" about workers, legal newspapers are handled very well. A group of officials called censors are assigned to these newspapers, and they specialize in monitoring these newspapers. As soon as a ray of truth reveals through the cracks, they resort to red ink and scissors. Notices fly to the censorship committee one after another—“No news about workers can be revealed, no events are allowed to be published, no discussions on certain things are allowed,” and so on. Of course, under such conditions, the newspaper cannot be properly handled, and it is futile for workers to look for reports and correct evaluations of their affairs in its pages, even between the lines. If it is thought that workers can use the few lines that merely involve their affairs, which happen to have slipped out due to the mistake of the executioner censor, in a certain legal newspaper, then it should be said: It proves a lack of understanding of things to place hope on these fragments and establish any propaganda system on these trivial matters.
    Let's repeat it again: we say this only for the reference of some inexperienced readers.
    Therefore, free Georgian periodicals are urgently needed by the Social Democratic movement. Now the only question is: how to handle this publication, what should it take as its guide, and what should it give to the Georgian Social Democrats.
    If we look at the issue of Georgian newspapers in general from the sidelines, especially at the issue of its content and direction, then it may make people think that this issue is naturally and simply solved by itself: the Georgian Social Democratic movement is not isolated, not just a separate Georgian workers' movement with its own program, it is advancing hand in hand with the all-Russian movement, so it is subject to the Russian Social Democratic Party—it is very clear that the Georgian Social Democratic newspaper should only be a local organ, mainly clarifying local issues and reflecting local movements. But behind this answer lies difficulties that we cannot avoid and will inevitably encounter. We are talking about the difficulty in terms of written language. When the Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Party can use the newspapers of the whole party to explain all the general issues and let its district committees only clarify local issues, then the Georgian newspaper is in a difficult situation in terms of content. The Georgian newspaper should simultaneously play the role of the organ of the whole party, as well as the district and local. Because most Georgian worker readers cannot freely use Russian newspapers, the leaders of Georgian newspapers have no right not to clarify all the issues that all-party Russian newspapers are discussing and should discuss. In this way, the Georgian newspaper has the responsibility to make readers aware of all the principle theoretical issues and tactical issues. At the same time, it has the responsibility to lead the local movement, clarify every event in a due manner, cannot leave any fact unexplained, and answer all the questions that local workers care about. The Georgian newspaper should connect and unite the fighting Georgian workers with the fighting Russian workers. The newspaper should report to readers all the phenomena they care about in local, Russian and foreign life.
    Our general view of Georgian newspapers is like this.
    A few words about the content and direction of the newspaper.
    We should require it, like the Social Democratic newspaper, to mainly pay attention to the fighting workers. We think it is superfluous to say that only the revolutionary proletariat in Russia and generally in various places is historically endowed with the mission of liberating mankind and giving happiness to the world. Obviously, only the workers' movement has its own solid foundation, and only it is free from various utopian fallacies. Therefore, the newspaper, as the organ of the Social Democrats, should lead the workers' movement, give it instructions on the road, and protect it from making mistakes. In a word, the most important responsibility of the newspaper is to be as close as possible to the working masses, to be able to influence it regularly, and to become its conscious leading center.
    However, because in today's situation in Russia, other social elements besides workers can also be mobilized as fighters "for freedom", and because this freedom is the immediate goal of the fighting workers in Russia, the newspaper should give status to any revolutionary movement, even if it occurs outside the workers' movement. We say not only to "give status" to news or ordinary news--no, the newspaper should pay special attention to the revolutionary movements that are happening or will happen among other social elements. It should explain every social phenomenon, thereby influencing every fighter for freedom. Therefore, the newspaper must pay special attention to the political situation in Russia, estimate all the consequences of this situation, and how to raise the question of the necessity of political struggle more widely.
    We are sure that no one can use our words to prove that we seem to be supporters of contact and compromise with the bourgeoisie. Giving due estimation and pointing out the weaknesses and errors of the movement against the current system--even if this movement occurs in bourgeois society--cannot put the stain of opportunism on the Social Democrats. We should just not forget the principles of the Social Democrats and the methods of revolutionary struggle here. If we measure every movement with this yardstick, we will be able to avoid any Bernstein-style delusions.
    In this way, the Georgian Social Democratic newspaper should clearly answer all the questions related to the workers' movement, clarify various principle issues, theoretically explain the role of the working class in the struggle, and illuminate every phenomenon encountered by workers with the light of scientific socialism.
    The newspaper should also be a representative of the Russian Social Democratic Party, reporting to readers in a timely manner all the tactical views held by the Russian Social Democratic Party. It should tell readers how workers in other countries live and how they improve their situation; it should timely call on Georgian workers to mobilize in the struggle. At the same time, the newspaper should not fail to consider any social movement and should not fail to give Social Democratic criticism.
    Our view of Georgian newspapers is like this.
    We cannot deceive ourselves or deceive readers, and we vow to fully implement these tasks with our existing strength. In order to make the newspaper a good one, it needs help from readers and sympathizers. Readers will see that the first issue of "Struggle" has many shortcomings, but these shortcomings can be corrected if readers can provide help. Here we emphasize the weakness in local news. We are far away from our hometown and have no way to observe the revolutionary movement in Georgia and report and clarify the issues that occur in this movement in a timely manner. Therefore, help from Georgia itself is necessary. Whoever is willing to help us in terms of writing, undoubtedly, will have a way to establish direct or indirect contact with the editorial department of "Struggle."
    We call on all fighting Georgian Social Democrats to enthusiastically care about the fate of "Struggle," to assist its publication and distribution in various ways, thereby making Georgia's first free newspaper "Struggle" a weapon of revolutionary struggle.
    (First issue of "Struggle," September 1901. The original text was not signed by the author. Translated from Georgian.)
    (Annotation) "Struggle" was the first illegal Georgian newspaper of the Tiflis Social Democratic organization and its Lenin "Iskra" group. Stalin was the advocate of founding "Struggle." The publication of "Struggle" was the result of the struggle of the revolutionary minority (Stalin, Kezehoeli, Churuqize) in the first Georgian Social Democratic organization "Messamedasii" since 1898 against the opportunist majority (Zhaoerdania and others) in the society on the issue of founding illegal Marxist publications. "Struggle" was typeset by an underground printing house in Baku, which was established by Kezehoeli, Stalin's closest comrade-in-arms, who was assigned by the revolutionary faction of the Tiflis Social Democratic organization. He was responsible for the actual work of distributing the newspaper. Stalin wrote the guiding articles on the program and tactics of the revolutionary Marxist party in "Struggle." "Struggle" published four issues: the first issue in September 1901, the second to third issues in November-December 1901, and the fourth issue in December 1902. "Struggle"--the excellent Marxist newspaper second only to Lenin's "Iskra" in Russia--insisted on the inseparable connection between the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat in South Caucasus and the revolutionary struggle of the working class in the whole of Russia. In defending the theoretical foundation of revolutionary Marxism, "Struggle", like Lenin's "Iskra", promoted that the Social Democratic organization must turn to mass political agitation and turn to political struggle against the autocratic system, and it insisted on Lenin's idea of the proletariat's leadership in the bourgeois democratic revolution. In the struggle against economism, "Struggle" demonstrated the necessity of establishing a unified revolutionary party of the working class, and exposed the liberal bourgeoisie, nationalists and all kinds of opportunists. Lenin's "Iskra" pointed out that the publication of the first issue of "Struggle" was an extremely important event. - Note by the Russian edition editorial department

　　《斗争报》编辑部的话
    斯大林
    本文是斯大林所创办的在巴库出版的高加索梯弗里斯社会民主党组织非法报纸《斗争报》第一期的社论。原文系格鲁吉亚（旧译乔治亚）文，俄文译文见一九四六年苏联国家政治书籍出版局印行的《斯大林全集》第一卷。在这篇社论中，斯大林对于报纸应当力求成为工人群众和全体人民群众的领导中心，应当注意国内政治情况和每一社会现象并给以马克思主义的解释和批评，应当与读者建立密切的联系等项革命报纸工作的原则，给了重要的指示。
                  ——编者
    我们深信自由的定期出版物对于觉悟的格鲁吉亚读者是一个紧要的问题；我们深信今天这个问题一定要解决，再拖延下去就只能给共同事业带来损害；我们深信觉悟的读者会满意地来迎接这种出版物，并且从自己方面给它以各种帮助，——我们，一部分格鲁吉亚革命社会民主党人，要迎接这一需要，竭尽我们的力量来满足读者的愿望。我们出版了格鲁吉亚第一个自由的报纸《斗争报》第一期。
    为了使读者对我们的出版物、特别是对我们有一定的看法，我们来说几句话。
    社会民主运动不曾让我国任何一个角落没有被触动过。就是我们称为高加索的俄国这个角落也未曾避免得了，而且同高加索一起，我们的格鲁吉亚也未曾避免得了。社会民主运动在格鲁吉亚还是不久以前的现象，它一共才有几年，更确切些说，这个运动的基础是在一八九六年才奠定的。像在任何地方一样，在我们这里最初工作也没有走出秘密活动范围。鼓动与广泛宣传，像我们最近所看到的，在当时是不可能的，并且不管愿意与否，一切力量只得集中在几个小组内。现在这个时期已经过去了，社会民主主义思想在工人群众中间获得了传播，而且工作也走出了自己狭隘的秘密活动范围，抓住了很大一部分工人。公开的斗争开始了。斗争在头一批工作者面前提出了许多这样的问题，这些问题在此以前是被湮没着的，而且解释它们又没有感到很大的需要。首先尖锐地提出来了这个问题：我们有什么手段去更广泛地展开斗争呢？口头上来回答这个问题是很简单和容易的。而事实上所得到的却完全是另外一回事。
    不用说，广泛地宣传与鼓动革命思想对于社会民主党有组织的运动是主要的手段。然而革命者不得不在其中活动的条件，却是如此地矛盾，如此地艰难，并且要求作这样大的牺牲，以致无论是宣传和鼓动，要像运动最初时期所需要的那样，往往就成为不可能。
    在小组中借助书本与小册子学习成为不可能了，这首先是由于警察情况，其次则是由于事情的处理本身。鼓动工作在第一批逮捕之下就松懈下来。与工人联系及常常到工人那里去，渐渐成为不可能，而工人却等待着解释许多迫切的问题。工人周围是残酷的斗争，政府运用一切力量来反对他们，他们没有可能批判地来对待目前的环境，他们对于事情的本质没有任何的材料，只要他们邻近的什么工厂遭受了小小的失败，常常就足以使具有革命情绪的工人灰心丧气，失掉对将来的信心，而领导者就不得不重新吸引他们来参加工作。
    借助只解答某些具体问题的小册子来进行鼓动，在大多数场合下是很少效果的。创作解答每天问题的著作就成为必要。我们且不去证明大家都知道的这个真理。在格鲁吉亚工人运动中已经到来了这个时机：定期出版物成为革命工作最主要的手段之一。
    关于合法的报纸，我们认为必须说几句话以供某些没有经验的读者参考。如果工人中有谁认为合法的报纸，无论它在任何情况下出版，无论它的方向如何，总是工人利益的表现者，那末我们认为这是很大的错误。在“关心”工人的政府那里，对于合法的报纸是处理得很好的。一群叫作检查官的官吏被指派到这些报纸那里去，他们专门监视着这些报纸，只要一有真理的光芒通过缝隙透露出来，他们便诉诸红墨水与剪刀。通告一个接着一个飞向检查委员会——“不能透露任何一点有关工人的消息，不许公布某一事变，禁止议论某事和某事”以及其他等等。当然，在这种条件下，报纸是不能办理适当的，工人在其篇幅上、甚至在字里行间，要寻找关于他们的事情的报道和正确评价，是枉然的。如果认为工人可以利用某一合法报纸的仅仅由于刽子手检查官的错误而脱漏出来的顺便涉及他们事情的寥寥几行，——那末应该说：把希望寄托于这些片断，在这种小事上建立任何宣传体系，都是证明对事情的不了解。
    我们且重复一遍：我们说这个仅仅是供若干没有经验的读者参考而已。
    因此，格鲁吉亚自由的定期出版物是社会民主运动所迫切需要的。现在问题只在于：怎样来办理这个出版物，它应当以什么为指南，它应当给予格鲁吉亚社会民主党人什么东西。
    如果从旁边一般地来看格鲁吉亚报纸存在的问题，特别是看它的内容与方向的问题，那末可能使人以为：这个问题是自然而且简单地自行解决了：格鲁吉亚的社会民主运动不是孤立的、不是仅仅单独的具有自己纲领的格鲁吉亚工人运动，它是与全俄的运动手携手地前进的，所以它服从于俄国社会民主党，——由此就很明白：格鲁吉亚社会民主党的报纸应当只是地方机关报，主要是阐明地方问题和反映地方运动。但是在这个回答后面却隐藏着我们所不能回避的而且必然将碰到的困难。我们说的是文字方面的困难。当俄国社会民主党中央委员会借助全党的报纸有可能解释一切总的问题，让自己的区委员会只阐明地方问题的时候，——格鲁吉亚报纸在内容方面就处于困难的境地了。格鲁吉亚报纸同时应当起全党的、以及区的、地方的机关报的作用。因为大多数格鲁吉亚工人读者不能自由地利用俄文报纸，格鲁吉亚报纸的领导者就没有权利把全党的俄文报纸正在讨论和应当讨论的一切问题不加以阐明。这样，格鲁吉亚报纸有责任使读者认识一切原则的理论问题和策略问题。同时它有责任领导地方运动，以应有的方式阐明每一事变，不能留下任何一个事实不加解释，并且回答地方工人所关心的一切问题。格鲁吉亚报纸应当把格鲁吉亚战斗的工人与俄罗斯战斗的工人联系起来，统一起来。报纸应当向读者报道地方、俄国和国外生活中一切他们所关心的现象。
    我们对格鲁吉亚报纸的看法一般就是如此。
    关于报纸内容和方向的几句话。
    我们应当要求它，就像要求社会民主党的报纸一样，主要是注意战斗的工人。我们认为说什么在俄国以及一般在各个地方只有革命无产阶级才被历史赋以解放人类并给世界以幸福的使命，乃是多余的。显然地，只有工人运动才有自己坚固的基础，也只有它才摆脱了各种空想的谬论。所以，作为社会民主党人的机关报的报纸应当领导工人运动，给它指示道路，保护它不犯错误。一句话，报纸最首要的责任是尽可能地靠近工人群众，能够经常地影响它，成为它的自觉的领导中心。
    然而因为在俄国今天的情况下，除了工人以外，作为“争取自由”的战士的其他社会分子同样可以发动起来，并且因为这个自由是俄国战斗的工人的最近的目的，——所以报纸应当给予任何革命运动以地位，纵然它是发生在工人运动之外的。我们说不仅仅对于消息或普通新闻要“给予地位”，——不，报纸应当特别注意其他社会分子中间正在发生或将要发生的革命运动。它应当解释每个社会现象，从而影响每个争取自由的战士。因此，报纸一定要特别注意俄国的政治情况，估计到这个情况的一切后果，以及如何能够更广泛地提出政治斗争必要性的问题。
    我们确信：无论谁也不能利用我们的话来证明我们似乎是拥护与资产阶级联系和妥协的人。给予反对现行制度的运动的弱点和错误以应有的估计和指点，——纵然这个运动发生在资产阶级社会中，——是不能把机会主义的污点加在社会民主党人身上的。我们在这里只是不应当忘记社会民主党的原则与革命斗争的方法。如果我们以这个尺度来衡量每一运动，我们就会能避免任何伯恩斯坦式的妄想。
    这样，格鲁吉亚社会民主党的报纸应当明确答复一切与工人运动有联系的问题，阐明各个原则问题，从理论上阐明工人阶级在斗争中的作用，用科学社会主义的光芒来照明工人所遇到的每一种现象。
    报纸同时应当是俄国社会民主党的代表者，及时地向读者报道俄国社会民主党所抱持的一切策略观点。它应当告诉读者：其他各国的工人是怎样生活的，他们是怎样地来改善自己的状况的；它应当及时地号召格鲁吉亚工人在斗争场所上发动起来。同时报纸对任何一个社会运动不应不予以考虑，不应不给予社会民主党的批评。
    我们对格鲁吉亚报纸的看法就是如此。
    我们既不能欺骗自己，也不能欺骗读者，誓以我们现有的力量来完全执行这些任务。为了使报纸办得不错，就需要读者与同情者方面的帮助。读者会看到第一期《斗争报》有很多缺点，但这些缺点是可以改正的，如果读者方面能给予帮助的话。在这里我们强调地方新闻中的弱点。我们远离故乡，没有可能注观格鲁吉亚的革命运动，并及时地报导和阐明这一运动中所发生的问题。因此，从格鲁吉亚本身来的帮助是必要的。谁愿意在著作方面帮助我们，无疑地谁就会有办法与《斗争报》编辑部建立直接的或间接的联系。
    我们号召全体战斗的格鲁吉亚社会民主党人热烈关心《斗争报》的命运，以各种办法协助它的出版和发行，从而把格鲁吉亚第一个自由报纸《斗争报》作为革命斗争的武器。
    （《斗争报》第一期，一九○一年九月。原文未署作者名字。译自格鲁吉亚文。）
    （附注）《斗争报》是梯弗里斯社会民主党组织及其列宁《火星报》集团的第一个非法的格鲁吉亚文报纸。斯大林是创办《斗争报》的倡导者。《斗争报》的出版是从一八九八年起格鲁吉亚第一个社会民主党组织“麦撒墨达四”社中革命少数派（斯大林、克泽霍越里、楚鲁启则）在创办非法马克思主义报刊问题上所进行的反对该社机会主义多数派（饶尔丹尼亚及其他等人）的斗争的结果。《斗争报》由巴库的地下印刷所排印，这个地下印刷所是梯弗里斯社会民主党组织革命派委派斯大林最亲近的战友克泽霍越里创设的。发行报纸的实际工作都由他负责。《斗争报》上关于革命马克思主义党的纲领与策略问题的指导性论文都是斯大林写的。《斗争报》出版了四期：第一期在一九○一年九月，第二——三期在一九○一年十一月——十二月，第四期在一九○二年十二月。《斗争报》——仅次于《火星报》的俄国优秀的马克思主义报纸——坚持了南高加索无产阶级革命斗争与全俄工人阶级革命斗争的不可分割的联系。在捍卫革命马克思主义的理论基础时，《斗争报》像列宁的《火星报》一样宣传了社会民主党组织必须转到群众性的政治鼓动、转到与专制制度作政治斗争，它并且坚持了资产阶级民主革命中无产阶级领导权的列宁思想。在与经济主义作斗争中，《斗争报》论证了建立工人阶级统一的革命政党的必要性，揭露了自由资产阶级、民族主义者及一切五花八门的机会主义者。列宁的《火星报》指出了第一期《斗争报》的出版是一个极其重要的事件。——俄文版编辑部注
