Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd: TASS reports: A group of American prisoners of war in North Korea sent a cable to the Security Council demanding the immediate withdrawal of American troops invading Korea. The cable stated:

"We, a group of American prisoners of war in a North Korean prisoner-of-war camp, are making this appeal to you in order to stop the Korean War, which is currently causing more unnecessary loss of life on both sides.

"We entered Korea as part of the 'United Nations police force,' but after we were captured, we discovered that this was a unilateral intervention by the United States.

"We originally thought that when we arrived in South Korea, we would be welcomed by the South Korean people, and that the government headed by Syngman Rhee was supported by the South Korean people. We were very surprised when we saw the South Korean people treat us with indifference and hatred, and that the South Korean people were against the Syngman Rhee government.

"We have discovered the Korean people's hostility to Americans, and South Korean troops are fleeing from the front in droves. It is clear that the South Korean people do not want war.

"Since we were captured, we have found an explanation for this situation in South Korea: First, Syngman Rhee has never had the support of the people. The North Korean elections two years ago were conducted in a completely free and open manner, while the South Korean elections were conducted under a brutal and terrifying police rule. Second, the result of the so-called 'economic assistance' given to South Korea by the United States is factory shutdowns, widespread unemployment, and widespread starvation of the people. People living in this situation cannot be willing to defend their government and allow this situation to exist. Everything we have observed clearly points to an important fact: the entire Korean people eagerly hope that their country will be unified and free. They will never allow anything to interfere with or obstruct this desire. If it is necessary to fight, then they are determined to fight to the last inch of land and the last person. Our personal observations fully prove this point.

"The northern army has the support of united and enthusiastic people. In continuous operations, American troops are either killed, captured, or defeated. The presence of American troops on the battlefield cannot stop the People's Army from advancing rapidly.

"We have witnessed American planes indiscriminately bombing innocent people, hospitals, schools, homes, and even the purely residential areas where we are located. This does not cause a major change in the situation, except to deepen the Korean people's hatred of the United States.

"We are treated extremely humanely. We live in a modern Western-style house, manage our own meals, have three meals a day with bread, and also receive medical care.

"Since the collapse of Syngman Rhee's army, the war has been entirely between the Korean and American armies. Continued intervention by the United States will cause more meaningless sacrifices of the lives of American youths. Now, while many Americans are still alive, the United States should and must withdraw its troops from Korea. We call on you to take all possible measures to immediately stop this meaningless bloodshed."

The cable was signed by 37 people, including Major Dunn of the 21st Infantry Regiment of the 24th Division of the U.S. Army, representatives of the American POWs participating in the American Intervention in Korea protest rally.

　　朝鲜美军战俘电安理会
    要求立即撤退侵朝美军     
    呼吁采取一切措施制止这无意义的流血
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：在北朝鲜的一群美国战俘致电安理会，要求立即撤退侵略朝鲜的美国军队。电文称：
    “我们，一群在北朝鲜俘虏营中的美国战俘，向你们提出这个呼吁，为的是要阻止目前使双方遭受更多不必要的生命损失的朝鲜战争。
    “我们作为‘联合国警察部队’的一部分而进入朝鲜，但是在我们被俘以后，我们发现这是美国单方面的干涉。
    “我们原以为，当我们到达南朝鲜时，会受到南朝鲜人民的欢迎；以李承晚为首的政府是得到南朝鲜人民的支持的。当我们看到南朝鲜人民以冷漠和仇恨的态度来对待我们，南朝鲜人民是反对李承晚政府的时候，我们感到十分惊异。
    “我们发现了朝鲜人民对美国人的敌意，南朝鲜军队成群地从前线逃走。很显然地南朝鲜人民不要战争。
    “自从我们被俘以后，我们对南朝鲜的这种情况找到了解释：首先，李承晚从来没有得到过人民的支持。两年前的北朝鲜选举是在完全自由公开的方式下进行的，而南朝鲜的选举则是在残暴恐怖的警察统治下进行的。其次，美国给予南朝鲜的所谓‘经济援助’的结果是工厂停工、普遍失业和到处可见的人民挨饿的现象，生活在这种情况下的南朝鲜人民不可能愿意保卫他们的政府，和允许这种情况的存在。我们所观察到的一切，都清楚地指明一个重要的事实——全朝鲜人民都热切希望他们的国家得到统一和自由。他们绝不允许有任何事物来干涉或阻挡这一愿望。如果需要作战的话，那末他们决心战斗到最后的一寸土地、最后的一个人。我们亲身的观察完全证明了这一点。
    “北方的军队有团结的、热诚的人民来支援他们。在继续不断的作战中，美国军队不是被打死、俘虏，就是被击溃。美国军队亲上战场，也不能阻挡人民军的汹涌挺进。
    “我们目睹了美国飞机滥炸无辜人民、医院、学校、住宅，甚至我们所在的纯粹居住区域。这除了加深朝鲜人民对美国的仇恨，并不能引起局势的重大改变。
    “我们得到极人道的待遇。我们住的是一幢现代化的洋房，自己管理自己的伙食，每天三餐而且还有面包，此外还有医疗上的照顾。
    “自从李承晚的军队崩溃以来，战争完全在朝鲜和美国军队之间进行着。美国继续干涉下去，将使美国青年的生命作更多无谓的牺牲。目前当许多美国人还活着的时候，美国应该而且必需从朝鲜撤退它的军队。我们呼吁你们采取一切可能的措施，立即制止这毫无意义的流血。”
    电文由美国战俘抗议美国干涉朝鲜大会参加者代表，美军第二十四师第二十一步兵团邓恩少校等三十七名签字署名。
