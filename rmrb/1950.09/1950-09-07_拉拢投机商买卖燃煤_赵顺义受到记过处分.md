　　Zhao Shunyi Receives Demerit for Colluding with Speculators in Buying and Selling Coal
　　Zhao Shunyi, Director of the Shijiazhuang Office of the North China Military Region Transportation Department (hereinafter referred to as the Shijiazhuang Office), has been disciplined by the Party and military for violating state policy, disrupting the military transportation system, and colluding with private merchants to buy and sell coal for illegal profit. The facts are as follows:
　　In September of last year, Zhao Shunyi, Instructor Qi of the Military Region's Logistics Battalion, and Director Song of the Shijiazhuang Automobile Repair Factory, among others, jointly considered purchasing Yangquan coal for winter preparation. Subsequently, under the influence of departmentalism and selfishness, Zhao Shunyi went to Huang Zhixiang, manager of the Shijiazhuang Coal Depot, a private merchant, to handle the coal purchase. Zhao used the name of his agency to request the state-owned Coal and Iron Company and the Railway Bureau to sell coal and allocate wagons, and sent his secretary Li Fusheng to Yangquan with the private merchant Huang Zhixiang to negotiate. After the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce certified that the coal was indeed for military use and obtained military transportation procedures, they bought back 310 tons of coal.
　　Of these 310 tons of coal, 38 tons were used by the Shijiazhuang Office itself, 30 tons were allocated to the Logistics Battalion, and a total of 60 tons were allocated to the Automobile Repair Factory. Ten tons were treated as Huang Zhixiang's own purchase, and 52 tons were sold to Huang Zhixiang at the original Yangquan price plus freight. The remaining 120 tons were directly handled by Huang and sold to other private merchants at a slightly lower price than the Shijiazhuang market price. None of the units under the Transportation Department stationed in Shijiazhuang received any coal. Zhao Shunyi had discussed this coal transportation event with Political Commissar Yang Minghui of the office beforehand, and Yang also agreed to sell part of the coal after it was transported back.
　　After receiving instructions from higher authorities in January of this year, the Transportation Department's CCP Committee sent personnel to the office to urge its Party committee to conduct a review. However, the review report was vague and said it was to take care of the winter, showing extreme dishonesty. The Party committee sent personnel again to investigate, and found that the Shijiazhuang Office had illegally profited more than 490,000 yuan from this coal transportation in the name of the public. Zhao Shunyi used 50,000 yuan to buy two electric meters for the public, embezzled 70,000 yuan for personal use, and the remaining 370,000 yuan was still stored with Huang Zhixiang, but Zhao Shunyi was unwilling to admit the existence of this fund.
　　In April, after fully understanding the situation, the Transportation Department's Party Committee decided to handle the matter as follows:
　　(1) Zhao Shunyi abused his position for personal gain, violated policy, and disrupted the coal mine and military transportation systems. He was given a public warning within the Party; it was proposed that he be given a major demerit administratively, transferred back to the Transportation Department for introspection, and the matter be reported to the entire army.
　　(2) Yang Minghui, Secretary of the Office Party Committee, blindly agreed to purchase coal beforehand, and after purchasing coal, he did not distribute the remaining coal to his own troops, but agreed to sell it to private merchants. He should be criticized within the Party for shirking responsibility afterwards.
　　(3) Li Fusheng was in collusion with them and should conduct a review.
　　(4) Private merchant Huang Zhixiang concealed public funds, and the Shijiazhuang Municipal Government should handle him according to law.

### 拉拢投机商买卖燃煤  赵顺义受到记过处分

　　拉拢投机商买卖燃煤  赵顺义受到记过处分
    华北军区运输部石家庄办事处（以下简称石家庄办事处）主任赵顺义，违反国家政策，破坏军运制度，并拉拢私商买卖燃煤，非法牟利，已受到党纪军纪处分。事实经过如下：
    去年九月间，赵顺义同志、军区辎重营齐教导员和石家庄汽车修理厂宋厂长等，曾共同考虑购买阳泉煤作过冬准备。嗣后，赵顺义在本位主义与自私自利思想的支配下，即去找私商石家庄煤栈经理黄志祥办理买煤事宜。赵用本机关名义，请求国营煤铁公司和铁路局卖煤、拨车，并派秘书李富生随同私商黄志祥去阳泉交涉，经市工商局证明确系军事机关用煤，取得军运手续，买回三百一十吨煤。
    这三百一十吨煤，除石家庄办事处自用三十八吨，分给辎重营三十吨，汽车修理厂共六十吨以外，以十吨作黄志祥自购，五十二吨按阳泉原价加运费卖给黄志祥，其余一百二十吨，即直接经黄手，按石家庄市价略低售给其他私商。运输部所属驻石家庄各单位，却没分到一点煤。此次运煤事件，事先赵顺义曾和办事处杨明辉政委商讨过，运回后售出一部，杨亦同意。
    运输部中共党委于今年一月奉到上级批示后，即派人至该办事处督促其党委进行检讨，但检讨报告含糊其词，说是为了照顾过冬，表现极不老实。党委再度派人前去检查，结果查出石家庄办事处此次假借公家名义运煤获利四十九万余元。这笔利润，赵顺义用五万元给公家买了两个电表，私用了七万元，余下三十七万余元尚存放在黄志祥处，但赵顺义尚不愿承认有此款。
    四月，运输部党委于充分了解此事的情况后，决定作如下处理：
    （一）赵顺义假公营私，违反政策，破坏煤矿及军运制度。党内给以当众警告处分；提议行政上记大过一次，调回运输部反省，并将此事通告全军。
    （二）办事处党委书记杨明辉，事前盲目同意购煤，而购煤后又不把余煤分给自己部队，同意卖给私商，事后推卸责任，应受党内批评。
    （三）李富生同流合污，应作检讨。
    （四）私商黄志祥，隐瞒公款，请石家庄市府依法处理。
     （本文根据华北军区运输部党委的报告）
