Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 17th: People from all walks of life in Korea have expressed strong protests against the U.S. imperialists' use of their majority in the United Nations Security Council to reject the Soviet representative's proposal on a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and to stop U.S. aircraft from indiscriminately bombing peaceful cities and towns in Korea. Meng Chengheng, a worker at a mechanical factory, said: The Security Council's debate on the Korean issue over the past month has demonstrated the Soviet Union's consistent policy of peace, and at the same time, it has revealed the criminal aggression of U.S. imperialism. The Korean people will never be subdued by any atrocities of the U.S. aggressors.

The cultural worker Li Qiyong pointed out: The U.S. imperialists and their satellite countries used their majority in the Security Council to reject the Soviet proposal, which has made the Korean people even more angry. The Korean people are determined to inflict greater blows on the U.S. aggressors.

Jeong Seong-eon, Vice Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Party, and Kim Dal-hyeon, Chairman of the North Korean Cheondoist Chongu Party, respectively issued statements, pointing out that any conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists is not enough to weaken the Korean people's will to resist, and cannot stop the people of the world from uniting around the great Soviet Union, bravely advancing for peace. The Korean people will annihilate the enemy with an even more resolute will and strive for final victory.

　　美把持安理会拒绝苏建议
    朝鲜人民强烈抗议
    决以更坚决的意志消灭敌人
    【新华社平壤十七日电】朝鲜各界人士对美国帝国主义利用在联合国安全理事会的多数，拒绝讨论苏联代表提出的关于和平解决朝鲜问题和制止美机滥炸朝鲜和平城乡暴行的提案，一致表示强烈的抗议。某机械工厂的工人孟成横说：安理会在过去一个月中关于朝鲜问题的辩论，表现出苏联一贯的和平政策，同时，也显出了美国帝国主义的蓄意侵略的罪恶。朝鲜人民绝不会被美国侵略者的任何暴行所屈服。
    文化工作者李箕永指出：美国帝国主义与其仆从国家利用在安理会内的多数否决了苏联的提案，这就使朝鲜人民愈加愤怒。朝鲜人民们决心予美国侵略者以更大的打击。
    北朝鲜民主党副委员长郑圣彦和北朝鲜天道教青友党委员长金达铉分别发表谈话，指出美国帝国主义的任何阴谋，不足以削弱朝鲜人民的抗战意志，更不能阻挡全世界人民团结在为和平而斗争的伟大的苏联周围勇敢前进。朝鲜人民将以更坚决的意志，消灭敌人，争取最后胜利。
