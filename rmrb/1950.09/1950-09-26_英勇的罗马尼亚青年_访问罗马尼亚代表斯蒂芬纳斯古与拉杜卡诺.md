    Heroic Romanian Youth
    Visiting Romanian Representatives Ștefănescu and Răducanu
    The Romanian delegation to the World Federation of Democratic Youth, visiting the People's Republic of China, consists of two representatives: Ștefănescu, member of the Central Political Bureau of the Romanian Labor Youth Union, and Răducanu, editor-in-chief of the Romanian Labor Youth Union's newspaper "Young Spark."

    The two representatives spoke with the reporter about the glorious history of Romanian youth fighting against fascist rule before liberation.

    At that time, the reactionary groups composed of landlords, bankers, and big merchants implemented a policy of terror. Communist Party members and Youth League members were subjected to constant persecution, but under the leadership of the Party, the Youth League was still able to mobilize the youth of the whole country, persevere in the struggle in a difficult environment, and always stand in a leading position against the Antonescu government. At that time, the most important thing was to resist the aggressive war of the German bandits, and young people from all walks of life in the country joined this struggle. Young farmers refused to hand over grain, giving the invaders endless "worries." In the army, young soldiers who turned their guns to attack the fascists also played a great role. The Youth League published many pamphlets and newspapers, which had a very effective impact on education and propaganda. Comrade Răducanu's "Young Spark," was one of the "illegal" newspapers at that time.

    During that period, the cause of the Youth League was arduous and brilliant, and countless young heroes gave their lives for the independence of their motherland. Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Lazăr Ghinea were activists of the Bucharest Youth League. After being arrested, they were subjected to countless tortures in the reactionary public security organs, but they never revealed any information to the enemy, and finally sacrificed their lives gloriously. Now, thinking about the murder of such outstanding elements, it is an irreparable loss. But it is precisely because of countless such heroic sacrifices that Romania has achieved its glorious and splendid today!

    The Youth League's influence on the youth of the whole country is profound and widespread, and it has an inseparable close relationship with the liberation of Romania. When the Red Army entered Romania, young soldiers forced or persuaded their superiors to join the Red Army and oppose the invaders; after the liberation of Bucharest, the young people armed themselves again and took on the task of defending the country to prevent the resurgence of the invaders. Therefore, we can also say that the Youth League played a decisive role in the liberation war. (Attached picture)

### 英勇的罗马尼亚青年  访问罗马尼亚代表斯蒂芬纳斯古与拉杜卡诺

    英勇的罗马尼亚青年
    访问罗马尼亚代表斯蒂芬纳斯古与拉杜卡诺
    罗马尼亚参加世界民主青年联盟代表团来中华人民共和国访问的代表有两位：斯蒂芬纳斯古，罗马尼亚劳动青年联盟中央政治局委员，拉杜卡诺，罗马尼亚劳动青年联盟机关报《青年火星报》的主编。
    两位代表与记者畅谈解放以前罗马尼亚青年与法西斯统治进行斗争的光荣历史。
    那时，地主、银行家、大商人所组成的反动集团，实行着恐怖政策。对共产党员及青年盟员们施以不断的迫害，但在党的领导下，青年联盟仍能动员全国青年，在艰苦的环境中坚持斗争，而且永远站在领导的地位，反对安多尼斯哥政府。当时最重要的是反抗德国强盗的侵略战争，全国各阶层的青年人都投进这个斗争的队伍里。青年农民们，拒绝交粮，给侵略者以无穷的“后顾之忧”。在军队中，转过枪来向法西斯攻击的青年兵士，也发挥了极大的作用。青年联盟发行了很多小册子和报纸，在教育和宣传方面，收到非常的效果。拉杜卡诺同志所服务的《青年火星报》，就是那时“不合法”的报纸之一。
    那时期，青年联盟的事业是艰巨而辉煌的，无数的青年英雄为祖国独立付出了自己的生命。乔尔乔斯哥和拉乍古维是罗京布加勒斯特青年联盟的积极分子。被捕后，在反动的公安机关里，不知受了多少酷刑，始终不向敌人吐露一点消息，终于光荣地牺牲了生命。现在想起来这种优秀分子的被杀害，是无可补救的损失。但也正因为有无数的这样的英勇牺牲，才获致了罗马尼亚辉煌灿烂的今天！
    青年联盟给全国青年影响是深入广泛的，它与罗马尼亚的解放有着不可分的密切关系。当红军进入罗马尼亚的时候，青年兵士们，强迫或说服他们的长官加入红军，反对侵略者；在罗京解放之后，青年们又武装了自己，负起保卫国家的工作，以防止侵略者的死灰复燃。因此我们也可以这样说，青年联盟在解放战争中是起了决定作用的。（附图片）
