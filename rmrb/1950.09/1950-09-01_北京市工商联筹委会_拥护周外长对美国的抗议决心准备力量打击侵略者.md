　　Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee
    Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's Protest to the United States; Determined to Prepare Strength to Strike Aggressors
    [This newspaper reports] The Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce Preparatory Committee issued a written statement in support of Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the United States and the request to the Security Council, stating: The Beijing industrial and commercial circles are unanimously indignant upon hearing of the crimes of the U.S. Air Force, and are determined to unite as one, resolutely support the solemn statement of the Central People's Government, and vow to be its backing.

    The barbarous crimes of the U.S. planes are not without a plan. They are entirely rampant under the command of the U.S. government and MacArthur. The Beijing industrial and commercial circles will certainly follow the people of all of China, rise up together, prepare all strength to resist the aggression against Taiwan and Northeast China by American imperialism, and resolutely fight to the end to strike its provocations.

　　北京市工商联筹委会
    拥护周外长对美国的抗议决心准备力量打击侵略者
    【本报讯】北京市工商联筹委会为拥护周外长对美国的抗议和向安理会的要求，发表书面意见称：北京市工商界闻悉美空军罪行后，一致愤慨，决团结一致，坚决拥护中央人民政府的严正声明并誓为后盾。
    美国飞机这种残暴的罪行，不是没有计划的。它完全是受美国政府及麦克阿瑟的指挥而横行。北京市工商界一定追随全中国人民之后，一致奋起，为反抗美帝国主义对台湾及东北的侵略行为，准备一切力量，坚决打击其挑衅而奋斗到底。
