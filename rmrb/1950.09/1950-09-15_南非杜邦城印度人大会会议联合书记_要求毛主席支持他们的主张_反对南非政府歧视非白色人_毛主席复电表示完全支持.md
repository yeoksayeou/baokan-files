Xinhua News Agency, September 14th: A.I. Meer and J.N. Singh, Joint Secretaries of the Durban South African Indian Congress in the Union of South Africa, wrote to Chairman Mao Zedong on August 17th, requesting Chairman Mao and other Chinese individuals and organizations to support them in opposing the South African Union government's discrimination and oppression of non-white people in South Africa. Chairman Mao Zedong has replied by telegram expressing his full support. The letter and reply are as follows:

A.I. Meer and J.N. Singh's letter to Chairman Mao:
To General Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:

The South African Indian Congress of the Union of South Africa will hold an important meeting in Johannesburg on September 15th, 16th, and 17th, 1950, to discuss the increasingly fierce attacks by the Malan government on the non-white people of the Union of South Africa. Dr. Moroka, a leader of the African people, will preside over this historic meeting.

We believe that this meeting is extremely necessary to reaffirm our attitude towards the problem of racial segregation and the denial of basic human rights to more than four-fifths of the people of South Africa. If you could send a letter of support for our meeting, and if possible, urge other individuals and organizations in your country to take similar action, our determination to oppose racial oppression will be greatly strengthened.

We would be most grateful if the letter could be sent before September 1st. If delays are unavoidable, please telegraph the South African Indian Congress in Durban.

Joint Secretaries: A.I. Meer and J.N. Singh
August 17th
P.O. Box 365, Durban, South Africa

Chairman Mao's Reply Telegram to Mr. A.I. Meer and Mr. J.N. Singh, Joint Secretaries of the Durban South African Indian Congress in the Union of South Africa:

On behalf of the Chinese people, I fully support your demands against the South African Union government's discrimination and oppression of non-white people (including Indian and other Asian people) in South Africa, and wish your meeting success.

Mao Zedong
Beijing, September 13th

　　南非杜邦城印度人大会会议联合书记
    要求毛主席支持他们的主张  反对南非政府歧视非白色人
    毛主席复电表示完全支持
    【新华社十四日讯】南非联邦杜邦城南非印度人大会会议联合书记Ａ·Ｉ·梅尔与Ｊ·Ｎ·兴赫，于八月十七日致函毛泽东主席，请求毛主席及中国其他人士和团体支持他们，反对南非联邦政府歧视及压迫南非洲的非白色人民。毛泽东主席已电复表示完全支持。来函及复电如下：
        Ａ·Ｉ·梅尔与Ｊ·Ｎ·兴赫致毛主席函中华人民共和国主席毛泽东将军：
    南非联邦印度人大会将于一九五○年九月十五、十六、十七三日在约翰内斯堡召开一个重要的会议，讨论马兰政府对于南非联邦非白色人民的日益凶狠的进攻。非洲人民的领袖摩若卡博士，将主持这个历史性的会议。
    我们认为，为了重申我们对民族隔离及南非五分之四以上的人民的基本人权受到否认的问题的态度，这次会议是极其必要的。如蒙来函支持我们的会议，而且如果可能，蒙你敦促贵国其他人士和团体采取同样行动，则我们反对肤色压迫的决心将大大地增强。
    如来函能于九月一日前寄到，我们将不胜感佩。假如耽搁是不可避免的，则恳请致电杜邦城南非印度人大会。
    联合书记：Ａ·Ｉ·梅尔与Ｊ·Ｎ·兴赫
    八月十七日
    南非杜邦城，第三六五号邮箱

    毛泽东  北京九月十三日
