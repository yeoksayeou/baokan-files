Weinan Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, County, District, and Township Cadres
Through Rectification Study Land Reform Documents

[This newspaper dispatch] According to the Xi'an Masses Daily News: The first phase of the land reform training class held in Weinan Prefecture, Shaanxi Province, has concluded. A total of 493 county, district, and township cadres from the thirteen counties under the jurisdiction of the prefecture participated in the first phase of study. They studied policy documents related to land reform and rectification, summarized and reviewed their past work and ideological style, and improved their policy and ideological levels.

The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase mainly focused on rectification. First, the leadership systematically gave reports on class struggle, the anti-feudal united front in rural areas, class division, opposing bureaucracy, commandism, the mass line, and other aspects. Discussions were held through large and small meetings, linking theory to practical work. Individual talks were used to dispel the concerns of a few cadres who were "afraid of being demoted," "afraid of being purged," "afraid of being held accountable," and "afraid of retaliation for criticizing others in the future," thereby launching a self-motivated rectification movement from the top down. Using the spirit of the documents in connection with their own work, a detailed analysis and serious criticism was made of the past behavior of some cadres who did not go deep into the masses to understand the situation, publicize policies, beat and scold the masses, wrongly determine class status, protect landlords, and engage in corruption and degeneration. Everyone further recognized that these were the main root causes of the failure to carry out work and implement policies, and the main reasons for being divorced from the masses.

The latter phase of the study mainly focused on learning land reform policies. After the rectification, the level of awareness of the students generally improved, and they felt that their policy level was too low, so their enthusiasm for learning was extremely high. Many comrades even stayed up at night to carefully read the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on land reform issues at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. During the study, the leadership also gave reports on land reform work, overcoming the erroneous view of some students that "there are few landlords in the Guanzhong area, and land reform is not a big problem." After the above study, the students proposed that they immediately conduct land reform propaganda after returning to their posts, actively rectify the peasant associations, and create more favorable conditions for the upcoming land reform movement.

　　陕西渭南专区县区乡级干部
    通过整风学习土改文件
    【本报讯】据西安群众日报消息：陕西渭南专区举办的土改训练班第一期已经结束。参加第一期学习的有该专区所属十三个县的县、区、乡级干部共四百九十三人。学习了有关土地改革、整风等政策文件，总结与检讨了过去的工作与思想作风，提高了政策与思想水平。
    学习共分两个阶段进行。前一阶段主要是整风。首先领导上有计划地作了关于阶级斗争、农村反封建统一战线，划分阶级、反对官僚主义、命令主义、群众路线等方面的报告，通过大小会议，联系工作进行讨论。用个别谈话方式打消了少数干部“怕降级”，“怕洗刷”，“怕追究责任”，“怕批评别人将来受报复”等顾虑，开展了自上而下的整风运动；用文件精神联系自己工作，对过去某些干部不深入群众了解情况、宣传政策，打骂群众，错订成分，庇护地主，以及贪污腐化等行为，均作了详细的分析与严肃的批评。大家进一步认清了这些是工作不能开展、政策不能贯彻的主要症结，和脱离群众的主要原因。
    学习的后一阶段主要是学习土改政策。经过整风，学员的觉悟程度普遍提高了一步，感到政策水平太低，学习情绪极为高涨。许多同志甚至夜间不休息地熟读中华人民共和国土地改革法和刘少奇同志在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议上关于土地改革问题的报告等文件。学习中，领导上又作了有关土改工作的报告，克服了部分学员认为“关中地区地主少，土改没啥问题”的错误看法。经过上述学习，学员们提出回去后立即进行土改宣传，积极整顿农会，为即将到来的土地改革运动创造更有利的条件。
