    (Answer) The idea of a dove carrying an olive branch symbolizing world peace is a common concept in Western societies. This concept originates from the story of the dove returning to Noah's Ark in Chapter 8 of the Old Testament's Book of Genesis. Before the 6th century AD, some frescoes made by persecuted Christians in Europe often used doves and olive branches to symbolize world peace, expressing the goals they wanted to achieve, based on this story. As a result, the concept of doves and olive branches as symbols of peace became more firmly established among the various ethnic groups in Europe. Since then, in European literature and art, doves and olive branches have been commonly cited as synonyms or symbols of peace. Now, to understand the meaning of this symbol, we must refer to the Old Testament's Book of Genesis. The Book of Genesis talks about the disaster of the great flood, "All living things that were on the face of the ground were wiped out—people and animals and creeping things and birds of the air. They were wiped from the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark." Later, the waters receded from the earth, "Then Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made and sent out a raven; and it went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth. Then he sent out a dove from him, to see if the waters had subsided from the face of the ground; but the dove found no place to set its foot, and it returned to him to the ark, for the waters were still on the face of the whole earth. So he put out his hand and took it and brought it into the ark with him. He waited another seven days, and again he sent out the dove from the ark. And the dove came back to him in the evening, and there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf; so Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. Then he waited another seven days, and sent out the dove; and it did not return to him anymore." (Old Testament, Book of Genesis, Chapter 8)

### 白鸽为什么象征世界和平

　　白鸽为什么象征世界和平
    （问）白鸽为什么可以作世界和平的象征，请加以解释？
      河南日报资料组
    （答）嘴里衔着橄榄叶的鸽子象征世界和平是在西洋各国的社会上一种通行的观念。这个观念起源于旧约《创世纪》第八章中鸽子回到挪亚的方舟里的故事。在公元六世纪以前，欧洲受压迫的基督教徒所作的一些壁画中间，往往有根据这个故事用鸽子和橄榄枝来象征世界和平，表现自己所要争取的目标的。这么一来，鸽子和橄榄枝作为和平的象征这一个观念在欧洲各民族的社会中间更加确定了。此后在欧洲的文学美术作品上，鸽子和橄榄枝是惯常被引用为和平的代名词或是标志的。现在我们要弄清楚这一种象征的意义，还得把旧约《创世纪》参照一番。《创世纪》上讲到洪水泛滥的灾难，“凡地上各类的活物，连人带牲畜、昆虫以及空中的飞鸟都从地上除灭了，只留下挪亚和那些与他同在方舟里的。”后来地上的水渐渐退了，“挪亚开了方舟的窗户，放出一只乌鸦去，那乌鸦飞来飞去，直到地上的水都干了，他又放出一只鸽子去，要看看水从地上退了没有。但遍地上都是水，鸽子找不着落脚之地，就回到方舟挪亚那里，挪亚伸手把鸽子接进方舟来。他又等了七天，再把鸽子从方舟放出去。到了晚上，鸽子回到他那里，嘴里衔着一个新拧下来的橄榄叶子，挪亚就知道地上的水退了。他又等了七天，放出鸽子去，鸽子就不再回来了。”（旧约《创世纪》第八章）
