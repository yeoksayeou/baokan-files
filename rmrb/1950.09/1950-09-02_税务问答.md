Tax Questions and Answers Editorial Staff:

　　We have established two egg processing factories in Xinxiang (named Pingyuan and Tongtai) to purchase eggs from rural areas and produce egg yolk and egg white products, which are then centrally exported through Tianjin to earn foreign exchange. With the support of the People's Government and the China Egg Products Company, we have been operating smoothly for more than a year. However, we are still unclear about the tax regulations for this year. Please provide answers so that we can promptly pay taxes in accordance with the regulations:

　　(1) Our finished products must be transported to Tianjin and handed over to the China Egg Products Company for unified export. Does this count as itinerant business?

　　(2) If our factory pays business tax and factory tax locally on a quarterly basis, should we still pay itinerant business tax?

　　Sincerely,
　　Xinxiang Tongtai Egg Factory, Pingyuan Egg Factory

Xinxiang Tongtai and Pingyuan Egg Factories:

　　Your questions have been answered by the State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government as follows:

　　1. Fixed industrial and commercial enterprises that temporarily send personnel to other places to sell goods manufactured by themselves or within the scope of their own business should request the local tax authorities to issue certificates and pay the business tax for settled businesses in the sales location. If there is no certificate, it will be regarded as itinerant business, and temporary commercial tax will be levied. This regulation has been implemented since July 1st of this year. Those before July should be handled according to the original local methods.

　　The sales portion on which business tax has already been paid can be deducted from the business tax levied at the location of the main organization after obtaining the tax payment certificate.

　　2. After paying business tax and factory tax locally on a quarterly basis, if you go to other places to sell, you should handle it according to the previous regulations. However, for temporary commercial taxes levied according to the original local methods before July 1st, if a tax payment certificate has been obtained, this business volume can also be deducted when levying business tax at the location of the main organization (this can also be taken into consideration when the democratic appraisal method is used at the location of the main organization).

　　税务问答编辑同志：
    我们在新乡设立制蛋厂两处（厂名平原、同泰），收购农村鸡蛋，制造蛋黄、蛋白成品，集中天津统一出口，换回外汇。并在人民政府和中国蛋品公司扶植下，业已顺利经营年余。惟对今年税章规定，我们尚有不明之处，请予答复，以便迅速照章缴纳：
    （１）本厂成品必须运至天津，交中国蛋品公司统一出口，算不算行商？
    （２）本厂在当地按季缴纳营业税和出厂税，是否还应缴纳行商税？
                                        新乡同泰蛋厂、平原蛋厂同启新乡同泰、平原两蛋厂：
    你们提的问题已由中央人民政府财政部税务总局答复如下：
    一、固定工商业，临时派员赴外埠销售自制或本业范围以内的货品，应请所在地税务机关发给证明文件，并就销货地交纳座商营业税。如无证明文件，即视为行商，课征临时商业税。此种规定，已自今年七月一日起施行，其在七月份以前者，则应照各地原办法办理。
    前项已交营业税之售货部分，经取得完税凭证后，于本机构所在地征收营业税时，准予扣除此项营业额。
    二、在当地按季交纳营业税和出厂税后，如赴外埠销售，即照前项规定办理。惟在七月一日以前按照各地原办法所课征之临时商业税，其已取得完税凭证者，亦可于本机构所在地征收营业税时，准将此种营业额扣除（本机构所在地采用民主评议的方法时，亦可予以照顾）。
