　　Northeast Peace Signature Campaign Continues to Unfold
    Number of Signatures Exceeds 22 Million         
    Determined to Strive for 30 Million Signatures
    [This Newspaper reports] According to the Northeast Daily: The Shenyang Branch of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, in response to the call of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace to expand the collection of peace signatures, and to further deepen the peace signature campaign in the Northeast region, specially convened an enlarged meeting of all committee members on the 23rd. The meeting mainly summarized past experiences, discussed and arranged future work, and decided: The Northeast region will strive to reach 25 million to 30 million peace signatories.

    The meeting pointed out: The Northeast region's signature campaign over the past three months has achieved great results. Starting in mid-May, it first unfolded widely in large and medium-sized cities, and then quickly expanded to small cities and rural areas. The entire Northeast formed a large-scale mass movement. As of now, 22,195,813 people in the Northeast have signed the Declaration for the Defense of Peace, accounting for 53.2 percent of the total population of the Northeast region. This fully demonstrates that the people of the Northeast are very concerned about and attentive to the great cause of defending world peace. More importantly, this movement has educated a broad number of cadres and the broad masses of the people, enabling them to take a step forward in their political consciousness.

    When discussing the call of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace for the people of the whole country to continue their efforts and strive for 200 million signatures, the meeting unanimously and enthusiastically responded. By the end of the movement in September, efforts will be made to obtain 25 million to 30 million signatures in the Northeast region. To this end, the meeting requested that the number of signatures in each city and county should generally reach three-quarters to four-fifths or more of the total population. Cities and counties that have not reached this goal should continue to work hard, while those that have reached it should focus on further deepening publicity and education. At present, a signature campaign should be widely launched in small towns and the vast rural areas in conjunction with flood prevention and preparations for the autumn harvest.

    The meeting believes that to do a good job in this movement and achieve the goal of 25 million to 30 million signatures, it is necessary to carry out publicity and education well to the broad number of cadres and masses. Only in this way can the political consciousness of cadres and the masses be raised a step further through this movement. Therefore, the meeting summarized past experiences in various aspects such as publicity organization, publicity methods, and publicity content, in order to promote them in the future.

    In addition, the meeting carefully analyzed the favorable conditions for completing the peace signature campaign in the Northeast region, and had confidence in completing the scheduled number of signatures. The Northeast not only has a concentrated urban population, but also a concentrated rural population. Most rural areas are large villages, and after the land reform, the farmers' political consciousness has been generally improved. These are all favorable conditions. Workers in cities and people from all walks of life are actively participating in the peace signature campaign. Taking Anshan City and the Lushun-Dalian area as examples, the number of signatures in Anshan City accounts for 88 percent of the city's total population; the number of signatures in the Lushun-Dalian area accounts for 80 percent of the total population. Both of these places have rural areas. If other provinces and cities use this as a standard, as long as publicity is widely carried out, the scheduled number of signatures in the entire Northeast can be fully achieved.

    Representatives of participating units put forward ways to continue carrying out the signature campaign in their respective units in the future. Che Xiangchen, Minister of Education of the Northeast People's Government, said: "Teachers and students in large, medium, and small schools in the Northeast are a large publicity force. Elementary school students alone number 4.5 million. They can not only mobilize their families and relatives to sign, but also widely publicize to the masses." Representatives of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions stated that they would definitely mobilize the provincial and municipal federations of trade unions, the industrial federations of trade unions, and the grassroots organizations of the trade unions to summarize past experiences and further cooperate with the central tasks to launch the signature campaign.

　　东北和平签名运动继续展开
    签名人数已逾二千二百万         
    决为争取三千万人签名奋斗
    【本报讯】据东北日报报道：中国保卫世界和平大会沈阳分会，为响应中国保卫世界和平大会扩大征集和平签名的号召，进一步深入展开东北区保卫和平签名运动，特于二十三日召开各委员扩大会议。会议主要总结了过去的经验，讨论与布置了今后的工作，并决定：东北区为争取达到两千五百万至三千万个和平签名者而奋斗。
    会议指出：东北区三个月来的签名运动获得了很大的成绩。自五月中旬起，首先由大中城市普遍展开，然后很快又扩展到小城市及农村，全东北形成一大规模群众性的运动，到目前为止，全东北已有二千二百一十九万五千八百一十三人在保卫和平宣言上签了名，占东北区总人口百分之五十三点二。这充分说明东北人民非常关心与注意保卫世界和平的伟大事业。更重要的是这个运动教育了广大干部，也教育了广大人民群众，使他们在政治觉悟上提高了一步。
    讨论到中国保卫世界和平大会号召全国人民继续努力，争取两万万人签名时，会议一致热烈响应。到九月运动结束时，争取东北区有二千五百万到三千万人签名。为此，会议要求各市县签名人数一般地应达到总人口的四分之三到五分之四以上，未达到这个目标的市县，应继续努力，已达到的则着重进一步深入进行宣传教育。目前应大力在小城镇与广大农村中结合防汛与准备秋收等工作，广泛展开签名运动。
    会议认为：要做好这一运动，而达到二千五百万到三千万人签名的目标，就必须很好地向广大的干部及群众进行宣传教育。也只有这样才能通过这一运动，使干部与群众的政治觉悟提高一步。因此，会议总结了过去关于宣传组织、宣传方法和宣传内容等各方面的经验，以便今后推广。
    此外，会议仔细分析了东北区完成和平签名运动的有利条件，都有信心的完成预定签名人数。东北不仅城市人口集中，农村人口也很集中，农村大都是大村庄，加以土地改革后，农民的政治觉悟都已普遍提高。这些都是有利的条件。在城市工人与各阶层人民都积极参加保卫和平签名运动。以鞍山市与旅大区为例，鞍山市签名人数占该市总人口的百分之八八；旅大区签名人数占总人口的百分之八十。这两地都有农村，如其他省市以此为标准，只要能广泛宣传，全东北的预定签名人数是完全可以达到的。
    与会单位代表在发言中纷纷提出关于本单位今后继续开展签名运动的办法。东北人民政府教育部车向忱部长说：“东北各大、中、小学的教师与学生就是一支很大的宣传队伍，仅小学生就有四百五十万人，他们既可动员他们的家属与亲戚签名，又可以广泛向群众宣传。”东北总工会代表表示：回去一定发动各省市总工会、各产业总工会以及工会的基层组织总结过去的经验，并进一步配合中心工作展开签名运动。
