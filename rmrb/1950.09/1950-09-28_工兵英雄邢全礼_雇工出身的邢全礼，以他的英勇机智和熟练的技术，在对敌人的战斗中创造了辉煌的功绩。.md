Engineer Hero Xing Quanli
Xing Quanli, who came from a hired worker background, created brilliant achievements in the fight against the enemy with his bravery, wit, and skilled techniques.

On the evening of April 20, 1949, the historic battle of the People's Liberation Army to cross the Yangtze River began. The sun had long set, and everything in front of him was dark, with a thin layer of fog rising from the calm river surface. Xing Quanli, an engineer and coxswain of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, sat upright in the driver's seat in front of the motorboat, gazing into the darkness at the landing point on the opposite bank. His task was to use the motorboat to tow two large flat-bottomed boats, sending a battalion command post and an assault company of infantry across the river.

At 6:30, the order to attack came. The infantry sailors on the motorboat and the two large flat-bottomed boats gently rowed with their oars, and the boat slowly slid towards the center of the river. To avoid exposing the target too early, the motorboat was not started. Xing Quanli stared straight ahead, one hand gripping the steering control lever, and the other holding the motor rope tied to his belt, waiting for the command to start, then he would pull the motor and rush forward.

After rowing for about fifteen minutes, the boat was not far from the shore. Suddenly, flames emerged from the enemy's pillboxes on the opposite bank, and heavy machine guns chattered. Xing Quanli immediately started the engine, pushed the gear, and with a burst of acceleration, the motorboat shot forward like an arrow. The heavy machine guns in the three enemy bunkers on the shore roared, and tracer bullets flew like rain over Xing Quanli's head. Then the enemy's artillery shells also came. The exploding flames illuminated the entire river in a fiery red, and the waves splashed high. Xing Quanli kept his eyes on the landing point on the opposite bank, steadily held the steering control lever and drove forward, quickly rushing to the river surface only thirty or forty meters from the south bank. At this time, Xing Quanli suddenly felt that the boat seemed to be much lighter. Thinking of the towed boat behind, he quickly reached out and touched the water. Sure enough, the tow rope had been broken by an artillery shell, and the flat-bottomed boat had drifted several hundred meters away from the motorboat, floating downstream in the enemy's fire zone. Xing Quanli immediately turned back, re-entered the enemy's fire net, rushed to the side of the flat-bottomed boat, and shouted to his deputy in the rain of bullets to tie the broken rope. Then, he opened the throttle to the maximum, turned the boat around, and rushed towards the south bank.

Just as he was about to pass through the enemy's fire net, the motorboat's gear pin was broken due to driving too fast, and the boat "anchored". There were no spare parts on the boat, so what to do? Xing Quanli reached back and accidentally touched the dry tobacco pipe in his pocket. He suddenly thought that there was still an iron wire for cleaning the pipe in the pipe, maybe it could be used. He took out the iron wire and inserted it into the hole of the gear pin. As soon as the gear was put into forward gear, the boat suddenly rushed forward again. To prevent this substitute gear pin from shaking off, Xing Quanli used his right hand to hold it firmly. He switched to his left hand to control the direction. The hot water spewing out of the drainpipe burned his right hand with a heart-wrenching pain, and cold sweat streamed down his head. When the pain became unbearable, he loosened his hand slightly, put his hand into the river to cool it, and immediately put it back to hold the gear pin. He always remembered that he was a Communist Party member, gritted his teeth, aimed at the landing point, and persisted in driving the motorboat forward.

When the boat reached the shore, the warriors of the assault company immediately jumped onto the south bank. Red and green landing flares lit up in the sky, and the cannons of the People's Liberation Army on the north bank roared. In the sound of this victorious artillery fire, Xing Quanli forgot about his scalded right hand, turned the motorboat around, and headed towards the north bank, welcoming the hundreds of sailing boats of the follow-up troops that were coming through the waves, towing the follow-up troops to the south bank time after time. He did not rest for two full days and nights, and he did not eat a single meal, persisting in his work.

This heroic engineer, Xing Quanli, is now the engineering platoon leader of a certain engineer unit of the Third Field Army. Originally from a hired worker background, since he joined the engineer unit of the People's Liberation Army in 1947, he has quickly mastered engineering techniques through hard study. In the past battles such as Weixian and Huaihai, he has been credited for completing tasks heroically and resourcefully. Among them, his achievements in tunnel operations in the Weixian Campaign in 1948 are particularly commendable.

At that time, he was a squad leader, and his company was responsible for the tunnel blasting mission in the north of the city. He himself was responsible for the extremely important "framing" (engineer terminology: that is, wooden frames are used to support the soil layer of the tunnel at a certain distance to prevent collapse). When the operation started, he was busy with "back-filling" (engineer terminology: that is, wooden boards are inlaid up, down, left, and right between the wooden frames of the tunnel to prevent soil collapse), and he did not sleep for three days and three nights. The air pressure in the tunnel was too low, and people couldn't breathe. He went back and forth many times under the enemy's fire net, looking for materials to make a ventilation windmill. Once, the "back-filling" of the tunnel was collapsed by enemy artillery shells, and a large piece of mud that collapsed injured his left leg, but he endured the pain and silently knelt on his right leg to insist on "framing", so that the tunnel would not collapse. When digging the medicine chamber, water came out from all around the tunnel, and the soil was about to collapse. Everyone was a little scared. He proposed the slogan: "In order to open the city of Weixian, it is an honor to sacrifice!" He took the lead to go in, and encouraged everyone to follow him in. The medicine chamber was small, so he crawled in the water to put on the "back-filling". Finally, he also found four iron buckets and filled them with explosives.

On the night of the general attack on Weixian, a loud noise of explosives in the tunnel destroyed the bunkers in the suburbs and filled the outer trench. The engineers gloriously completed the task of opening up a path for the troops to storm the city.

After the Weixian battle, the engineers took on the task of clearing landmines for the first time. When digging the first landmine, Xing Quanli told his comrades to stand far away, and carefully dug away the soil around the landmine, carefully looking for a way, and finally removed the detonator. He called everyone over and introduced his experience to them. Under his leadership, the entire battalion cleared 1,800 landmines in three days.

　　工兵英雄邢全礼
    雇工出身的邢全礼，以他的英勇机智和熟练的技术，在对敌人的战斗中创造了辉煌的功绩。
    一九四九年四月二十日傍晚，人民解放军强渡长江的历史性战役开始了。太阳早已下去，眼前一片黑暗，平静的江面泛起一层薄雾。解放军某部工兵操舟机驾驶员邢全礼，端正地坐在操舟机前面的驾驶座上，向黑暗里注视着对岸的登陆点。他的任务是要用操舟机拖着两只大平船，把步兵的一个营指挥所和一个突击连送过江去。
    六时三十分，攻击命令下来了。操舟机和两只大平船上的步兵水手们，用桨轻轻地划起来，船身慢慢向江心滑去。为了不过早暴露目标，操舟机没有发动。邢全礼注视着正前方，一手握着方向操纵杆，一手握着系在腰带上的马达拉索，只等一声发动，就拉动马达冲向前去。
    划了约摸十五分钟，船离岸不远了。对岸敌人碉堡里突然冒出火光，重机枪咯咯的叫了起来。邢全礼马上发动机器，推上排挡，一加油，操舟机就箭一样的冲向前去。敌人岸上三个碉堡里的重机枪都吼叫起来，曳光弹下雨一样的在邢全礼头顶上飞舞。接着敌人的炮弹也打来了。爆炸的火光把满江照得一片通红，浪花溅得高高的。邢全礼眼睛盯住对岸登陆点，沉着地把住了方向操纵杆向前驶去，很快就冲到只离南岸三、四十米达的江面了。这时邢全礼猛觉得船身好像轻了不少，想起后面的拖船，连忙伸出手去在水里一摸，果然拖绳已经被炮弹打断，平船离开操舟机已有几百米达，正在敌人火力圈里顺流漂荡。邢全礼马上开回去，重新穿进敌人火网，赶到平船旁边，在弹雨里叫副手结好断绳，然后开足油门，调转船头，向南岸扑去。
    快要穿过敌人火网的时候，操舟机因为开得太快，排挡销子被震断，船就“抛锚”了，船上又没有备用的零件，这可怎么办？邢全礼伸回手，偶然碰到自己口袋里的旱烟袋，猛想到烟袋里还有一根通烟管用的铁丝，也许可以用一用。他就把铁丝拿出来插到排挡销的孔子里，排挡一吃到前进挡，船猛一冲，又前进起来，为了不使这根排挡销代用品震掉下来，邢全礼用右手使劲顶住它，换了左手来操纵方向。排水管里喷出的热水烫得他右手挖心一样的痛，头上冷汗直冒，痛得实在握不住时，他就松一下手，把手伸进江水里凉一凉，马上又放上去抵住排挡销。他始终记住自己是共产党员，咬紧牙关，看准了登陆点，坚持着把操舟机开向前去。
    船靠了岸，突击连的勇士们马上跳上南岸，天空里亮起了红红绿绿的登陆信号弹，北岸解放军的大炮轰然怒吼起来。在这胜利的炮火声中，邢全礼忘了烫伤了的右手，调转操舟机，迎着破浪而来的后续部队的千百只帆船，向北岸开去，把后续部队一次一次的拖到南岸来。整整两天两夜他没有休息，一天没有吃饭，坚持着工作。
    这位英勇的工兵邢全礼，现在是第三野战军某工兵部队的工程排长，原是雇工出身，自从一九四七年参加了人民解放军的工兵部队以来，由于他艰苦学习，很快熟练了工兵技术，在潍县、淮海等历次战役里，都曾经因英勇机智完成任务而立过功。这里面尤其值得称道的，是他在一九四八年潍县战役中坑道作业中的功绩。
    那时他是班长，他所在的连担任城北坑道爆破任务。他自己负责极为重要的“配框”（工兵术语：即隔一定距离以木框顶住坑道土层，以防坍塌）。作业开始，他忙着上“背幅”（工兵术语：即在坑道木框间上下左右镶以木板，以防塌土），三天三夜没睡觉。坑道里气压太低，人喘不过气来，他在敌人火网下来回多次，找材料做好了通风的风车。一次坑道“背幅”被敌人炮弹震塌，塌下来的一大片泥土把他的左腿打伤了，但他忍受疼痛，一声不响的用右腿跪着坚持“配框”，使坑道不至塌下。挖药室时，坑道四周出水，土要塌下来了，大家有些害怕，他提出口号说：“为了打开潍县城，牺牲也光荣！”他带头进去，鼓舞了大家也都跟了进去。药室小，他就爬在水里上“背幅”。最后，他又找了四个铁桶装好了炸药。
    总攻潍县那天晚上，坑道里的炸药一声巨响，摧毁了城郊的地堡，填平了外壕，工兵们光荣地完成了给登城部队开辟冲锋道路任务的。
    潍县战斗结束后，工兵们又第一次担任了扫除地雷的任务。当挖第一颗地雷时，邢全礼叫同志们站得远远的，自己小心地挖去地雷周围的土，仔细的找门道，最后终于取掉了雷管。他把大家叫来，把自己的经验介绍给他们。在他的带头推动下，全营三天中扫除了一千八百颗地雷。
