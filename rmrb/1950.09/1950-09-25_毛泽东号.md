        Thirty-Five: A Very Important Matter
    Comrades Yue Shangwu and Zhao Haisheng newly joined the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" crew. The entire crew held a meeting to welcome them. Leaders from the section and the trade union also attended their meeting, assuring everyone that they would take good care of their family members. The old hero had a large family and more difficulties, so they first lent him some coal and money to settle his family down.

    Next, they discussed the work plan for entering the customs area, reviewed everyone's shortcomings, and set conditions for earning merit. Everyone was determined to resolutely implement and promote the system of contracted maintenance and responsibility, continue to extend the Class A inspection mileage, leave their shortcomings outside the customs area, and never bring them inside. After entering the customs area, they would not only help and care for their fellow workers, but also humbly learn from the workers inside the customs area and never be arrogant.

    "I propose!" At the end, Shang Baoheng said, "Everyone must improve their political awareness in order to truly overcome their shortcomings and complete their tasks. I am willing to speak on behalf of the entire group at the farewell meeting to respond to the hopes of the entire section for us."

    Everyone unanimously supported Old Shang's proposal.

    The farewell meeting for all the section's workers was held in the locomotive depot's auditorium. The Bureau also sent the director of the locomotive department to participate on behalf of the administration, expressing endless warmth, joy, and excitement. After the old hero gave his reply, he suddenly felt a great unease. He recalled a very important matter, and a series of memories trapped him.

    At the meeting, the trade union director, the locomotive department director, Representative Zhang, and others encouraged everyone: The "Mao Zedong Locomotive" must maintain its glory in the Northeast and truly play a leading role in the customs area, never become detached from the masses, and promote the Soviet Union's latest three-responsibility system well in North China, Central China, South China, and even every place in the country where railways are being built. The old hero replied at the meeting:

    "Wherever the army advances, the railway is built; wherever the railway is built, the Mao Zedong Locomotive runs; wherever the Mao Zedong Locomotive runs, the responsibility system is implemented!"

    The applause was as loud as thunder. How spirited and powerful he spoke! But the old hero was now trapped by a very important matter!

    What important matter?

    He thought: He had already spoken, and people had clapped their hands until they were sore, and he would be leaving in a day or two. But, but after entering the customs area, he was still not a Party member. Why hadn't he made progress in the three years since liberation? The Communist Party sincerely serves the people, and Communist Party members are the most glorious, but what about himself?

    After the meeting, he was still thinking as he walked: Guo Shude sincerely helps everyone, helps me! Guo Shude has no selfish desires! Guo Shude is a Communist Party member! Why does he make progress so quickly?

    "The train will be leaving in a day or two!" he said to himself. The more he thought about it, the more his heart felt like it was being doused with oil, his head was buzzing, and his face was flushed. Guo Shude had talked to him several times, but he always said he didn't meet the requirements. It was true that he didn't meet the requirements, because he could never let go of his family. Putting his own affairs first, how could he be qualified as a Communist Party member? But the thing he didn't want to say plainly was: Later, saying he didn't meet the requirements was no longer really about "family," but mainly an excuse, willing to wait and see, unwilling to join immediately.

    "Old Hero, what are you thinking about?" Hu Chundong, who was walking along with him, approached him.

    Before the old hero could answer, Little Zhu said:

    "I know what's on Old Hero's mind!" Saying that, he whispered to Hu Chundong.

    This time he heard and saw clearly, and became anxious, saying, "Are you guessing I'm missing my family again?"

    "No!" Little Zhu said, "I guess you..." and whispered to him again.

    The old hero's face turned red!

    Hu Chundong and Little Zhu both pulled him aside and said in a low voice:

    "This is upright and aboveboard, it doesn't matter, boldly bring it up to Foreman Guo. We two also discussed it long ago."

    "Why don't you two bring it up?"

    "Waiting for you, we'll bring it up when you do."

    "I'm afraid I still don't meet the requirements," he said, smiling slightly. He thought, "This time I've already figured it out, put my family aside, automatically requested to enter the customs area, determined to make a contribution to the people and Chairman Mao, even if I don't meet the requirements, I'm not far off, right?"

    This thought had already been guessed by the two young men, who said:

    "Hey, Old Hero, don't be polite, if you don't meet the requirements, who does?"

    Listening to this, the old hero felt as refreshed as walking out of a bathhouse after a hot bath. He became very happy and decided to bring this matter up to Foreman Guo. (Attached image)

        三十五、一件非常重大的事情
    岳尚武和赵海盛两位同志新参加“毛泽东号”工作，全组乘务员开会欢迎。段上和工会的领导同志们也来参加他们的会，向大家保证一定很好照顾他们的家属。老英雄人口多，困难也大些，先借给他一部分煤和钱，把家安顿好。
    接着，讨论了进关的工作计划，检讨了各人的缺点，订了立功条件。大家下定决心：要坚决贯彻和推广包乘包修负责制，继续延长甲检公里；把缺点扔在关外，绝不带到关内去；进关后不光帮助关心工友，还要向关内工友虚心学习，绝不骄傲。
    “我提议！”末了商保恒说：“大家要提高政治，才能真正克服缺点，完成任务。我愿意在欢送会上代表全组讲一讲，来回答全段对咱们的希望。”
    大家一致拥护老商这提议。
    全段职工的欢送会是在机务段大礼堂召开的，管理局还派机务处长代表来参加，说不尽的热烈、愉快和兴奋。老英雄致了答辞以后，突然感到很大的不安，他想起了一件非常重大的事情，接着一连串的回忆困住了他。
    会上，工会主任、机务处长、张代表等勉励大家：“毛泽东号”要保持在东北的光荣，到关内真正起带头作用，千万不要脱离群众，把苏联最新的三包负责制很好的推行到华北华中和华南，以至全国每一个建筑起铁路的地方。老英雄在会上答复说：
    “大军打到哪里，铁路修到哪里；铁路修到哪里，毛泽东号开到哪里；毛泽东号开到哪里，负责制就贯彻到哪里！”
    鼓掌声真像打雷一样响起来，他说得多有精神多有力量呀。可是老英雄现在被一件非常重大的事情困住了！
    什么重大的事情呢？
    他想起：话也讲了，人家手心也拍痛了，一两天就要走了。可是，可是进了关，咱还不是党员，解放三年为什么没进步？……共产党诚心诚意为人民，共产党员最光荣，可是自己呢？……
    散会以后，他走着还在想：人家郭树德实心实意帮助大家，帮助我！郭树德没有私心！……郭树德是共产党员！……人家为什么就进步这样快？……
    “一两天就要发车了！”他对自己说。越想心里越像浇了油，脑袋嗡嗡的，脸上烘烘的；郭树德曾经好几次找他谈，他都说不够条件。说不够条件也真不够，因为老是放不下一个家。把自己的事情放在头里，哪够一个共产党员的资格？可是最不好对人明说的是：后来说不够条件已经不是真正在“家”上面，主要是推托之辞，愿意再等一等，看一看，不愿意马上参加。……
    “老英雄，你净想什么呢？”一路走着的胡春东走近他。
    还没等老英雄回答，小朱又说了：
    “老英雄的心事我知道！”说着就附耳告诉胡春东。
    这下他听清看清了，也急了，说：“你是猜我又想家？”
    “不是！”小朱说：“我猜你……”又附耳告诉他。
    老英雄的脸飞红了！
    胡春东和小朱都拉他到一边，低声说：
    “这是正大光明的，没关系，向郭大车大胆提出来。咱俩也早商量好了。”
    “你两个为什么不提？”
    “等着你哩，你提我们就提。”
    “我怕还不够条件。”他说着，微笑了。他想：“这回我已经想开，把家庭放下，自动请求进关，决心给人民给毛主席贡献贡献，不够条件也差不远了吧？……”
    这心思也早被两个青年猜透了，他们说：
    “嗨，老英雄你别客气啦，你不够条件，谁还够条件？”
    老英雄听着，像洗了热水澡以后走出澡堂那样的轻爽，他变得很愉快了，决定找郭大车把这事提出来。（附图片）
