Without your support and encouragement, we dare to say that our victory would have been very difficult. After the basic victory of the war, in the arduous task of restoring and developing production, we have again witnessed the broad masses of working people quickly completing various planned construction projects, constantly improving production levels, resolutely overcoming various disasters and feudal oppression, and fighting for the prosperity of the country and the wealth of the people. This great spirit of courage and hard work, like during the war, constantly encourages us. Let us follow Chairman Mao's instructions and make our country "have an army for fighting and an army for labor." Let us combine these two major armies closely, with iron will and unparalleled fighting power, to defend the new country, build the new country, support the world anti-aggression front, strive for democratic peace, and smash the imperialist conspiracy of aggression!
