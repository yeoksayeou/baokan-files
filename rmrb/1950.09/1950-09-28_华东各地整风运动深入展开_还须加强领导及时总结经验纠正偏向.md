　　The Rectification Movement Deepens in East China
    Leadership Must Be Strengthened to Summarize Experiences and Correct Deviations in a Timely Manner
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily: The rectification movement is continuing to deepen in East China. Based on the situation in August, the rectification training by the provincial and regional party committees is coming to an end. The prefectural and county party committees have generally held rectification training classes. Many places have already concluded one or two sessions of rectification training classes. Nanjing held an expanded municipal party committee meeting and a party representative meeting in August. Shanghai trained rectification cadres in August and has started holding rectification meetings at all levels in September. The rectification of the East China Administrative Area-level organs is shifting from the summary work inspection leadership of various ministries and commissions to the business departments below. The rectification of cadres on the job in various places has also largely progressed to the stage of inspecting work and studying improvement methods.

    The rectification in various places is basically combined with current tasks, focusing on reading documents, summarizing work, analyzing the situation, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. The rectification methods can be generally divided into three types: first, holding cadre meetings and party representative meetings; second, holding work summary meetings by various work departments; and third, centrally organizing rectification training classes for cadres. According to the experiences of various places, adopting the first two methods of rectification makes it easier to connect with reality and summarize work, while rectification training classes make it easier to concentrate control, cultivate core members, and conduct typical demonstrations, as well as meet the needs of training land reform cadres. Therefore, rectification in various places generally combines two or three methods. The East China Administrative Area-level organs mainly adopt the method of holding cadre rectification meetings level by level according to the work system.
  Make Full Preparations Before the Meeting to Determine the Key Points of Inspection for Each Department
    Summarizing the experiences of various places, to hold cadre rectification meetings well, it is necessary to firmly grasp the following points: First, there must be sufficient ideological and organizational preparation beforehand, that is, all cadres must fully understand the environment and characteristics of this rectification, as well as its guiding principles and methods; leading cadres must understand the main problems to be solved by their departments; and a special rectification leading institution and leading core must be established. Second, the rectification report of the main responsible cadres needs to be well prepared and timely. The content of the report should include a brief summary of the work of the department, a review of the ideological style, and a self-review of the leadership style and leading cadres. The report should mainly review shortcomings and errors, but also point out achievements and correct styles at the same time. Third, the review of leadership style and work style must be carried out gradually from top to bottom, ensuring that democracy can be fully developed under centralized guidance. The general steps are: after the leading cadres have made full preparations, first unify the clear understanding of the main problems in the rectification meeting of a few core members, then展开讨论展开 discussion among all cadres, and then make a summary. Fourth, summarizing work and inspecting ideological style must focus on the center, and strive to solve some of the existing main problems according to possible conditions. It is not appropriate to involve too much or demand too high. Different departments and different objects should grasp different key points and give specific instructions and individual assistance. The above points should also be paid attention to in rectification training classes.

    At the beginning of this rectification movement, the leading organs generally showed that the preparatory work was not sufficient. For example, the guiding principles of this rectification were not thoroughly studied, and there was no clear understanding of the problems to be solved by the department. At the same time, the rectification reports of the leading cadres were often not timely. Therefore, at the beginning of the movement, the leaders and the masses were groping at the same time. The leaders did not take a step ahead of the masses or create typical experiences first and then promote the general, so that the leadership was in a passive position at the beginning of the movement, and once deviations occurred, they often became universal. This shortcoming is now being gradually overcome. In particular, Zhejiang and Fujian provinces adopted the method of convening party congresses or cadre meetings at all levels to carry out rectification. Nanjing first held an expanded municipal party committee meeting and a party congress, and then various departments carried out rectification. Shanghai first made preliminary preparations in the training class, and then the municipal party committee began to convene rectification meetings at all levels. These steps can ensure that the leaders at all levels can make full preparations for the rectification movement. Therefore, it is also more appropriate.
  It is Also Necessary to Overcome the Tendency to Isolate the Study of Documents and Emphasize the Inspection of Individuals
    Although rectification in various places is generally carried out by inspecting and summarizing work and striving to complete it within a certain period of time to ensure the implementation of land reform and other current tasks, due to the lack of clear understanding of the different environment and different requirements of this rectification from the two previous rectifications of the party, some deviations have occurred in some aspects and in some places. The main ones are that, except for a few places and training classes, generally, the study of documents is regarded as a stage, and the time for studying documents is too long (usually one month), so that the rectification movement stays in general document study for a long time. Secondly, individual places still conduct reviews with individuals as the center, or inappropriately emphasize personal reflection and personal appraisal, and even involve historical issues, or form non-political criticisms that drill into the horns, or form a situation of hard pursuit and hard forcing. In addition, some places attempt to solve all problems without a center, so that the time is prolonged and the effect is not great. These deviations are also being gradually corrected.
  Review Shortcomings, Point Out Achievements, and Pay Attention to Protecting the Work Enthusiasm of Cadres
    The experience of various places has also proved that the method of inspecting work from top to bottom and reviewing individuals in connection with the inspection of work can indeed make cadres happily correct their shortcomings and mistakes. However, some places initially only paid attention to reviewing shortcomings and mistakes, and only paid attention to reviewing the shortcomings and mistakes of lower-level cadres, which caused negative or dissatisfied emotions among some lower-level cadres. Although the focus of rectification is on reviewing shortcomings and mistakes, it is necessary to appropriately point out work achievements, especially to analyze good typical examples as demonstrations. This can make cadres not only see the present, but also see the future, not only know what is wrong, but also know what is right. Qidong and Haimen in northern Jiangsu, and Wujiang and other counties in southern Jiangsu, when summarizing production and disaster relief work in the spring and summer of this year, used the method of evaluation to conduct a movement to evaluate merits and review demerits, and used good and bad typical cases to educate cadres, which greatly improved the determination and confidence of cadres to correct mistakes and improve their style of work. This method can also be applied to the rectification training classes of rural cadres, and can be used as one of the important methods for rural cadres to regularly summarize work and improve their style of work in the future. When reviewing shortcomings and mistakes, it is also necessary to first clarify the responsibility of the leadership; and for the mistakes of the subordinates, it is also necessary to adopt a realistic, patient persuasion and education method. Before the truth is clarified and the thinking of the perpetrators is straightened out, do not draw conclusions too early, so as not to harm the work enthusiasm of cadres, and make the rectification achieve greater practical results.
  Strengthen Leadership, Combine Work, and Seriously Carry Out Criticism and Self-Criticism
    In terms of carrying out criticism and self-criticism, there are currently two situations: One situation is that the leading cadres have played a demonstrative role in their review reports by implementing a high degree of self-criticism, and the core members at all levels can generally implement this spirit, and the cadres below dare to speak freely, and can also conduct reviews closely around the implementation of work and policies. Here, the criticism and self-criticism are carried out very normally, and the main problems in the work are indeed solved. Another situation is that the review reports of the leading cadres are not well prepared, or lack the spirit of self-criticism, so the comrades below often discuss vaguely without a center, or there is a tendency to extreme democratization, which leads to detours. This is a problem that the leadership must pay attention to. When the latter situation occurs, self-reviews should still be carried out from top to bottom, the main problems reflected by the masses should be analyzed and synthesized, and the correct parts should be absorbed as important content for supplementary reviews, and appropriate explanations should be given to opinions that do not conform to the actual situation or even wrong opinions. It is necessary to avoid using organizational forces or simple and blunt methods to deal with the criticisms below.

    Finally, since this rectification is carried out under heavy work tasks, there is a tendency in some places to fail to coordinate work and rectification well, or to prolong the rectification time too long, which hinders the progress of current work, or to only take care of other work and relax the leadership of rectification, so that the deviations that occur cannot be corrected in time. All this will make it difficult for rectification to achieve practical results. When this rectification movement is deeply展开展开展开 and is about to end, it is very necessary to strengthen the leadership of rectification, summarize experiences in a timely manner, correct shortcomings and deviations, and make the movement achieve practical results.

### 华东各地整风运动深入展开  还须加强领导及时总结经验纠正偏向

　　华东各地整风运动深入展开
    还须加强领导及时总结经验纠正偏向
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报消息：华东各地整风运动继续深入展开。综合八月份情况，省委及区党委的整风轮训，即将告一段落，地委及县委已普遍举行整风轮训班，很多地方的整风轮训班已结束一期或两期；南京市于八月份举行市委扩大会及党代表会，上海市于八月份轮训整风骨干，九月份均已开始逐级举行整风会议；华东大行政区一级机关，正由各部委的总结工作检查领导转到部以下的业务各部门去，各地在职干部的整风亦大都进到检查工作及研究改进办法。
    各地整风，基本上都是结合当前各种任务，有重点地阅读文件、总结工作、分析情况、开展批评与自我批评。整风的方式大致可分为三种，第一种为举行干部会议及党代表会；第二种为由各工作部门举行工作总结会议；第三种为集中干部办理整风轮训班。据各地经验，采取前两种方式整风，易于联系实际总结工作，而整风轮训班则易于集中掌握，并可培养骨干及进行典型示范，同时又为训练土改干部所需要。故各地整风一般都是两种或三种方式结合使用，华东大行政区一级机关，主要采取按照工作系统逐级召开干部整风会议的方式。
  会前做好充分准备确定本部门检查重点
    综合各地经验，要开好干部整风会议，必须切实掌握以下各点：第一、事前要有充分的思想准备与组织准备，即要使全体干部能完全了解此次整风的环境与特点及其方针方法；领导骨干能了解本部门所须解决的主要问题；以及建立好专门的整风领导机构与领导核心。第二、主要负责干部的整风报告需要作好并须及时。报告内容应包括本部门工作的扼要总结、思想作风的检讨及对领导作风与领导干部的自我检讨。报告中主要检讨缺点错误，但也须同时指出成绩与正确作风。第三、检讨领导作风与工作作风，须由上而下逐步开展，保证在集中指导之下能够充分发扬民主。一般步骤是经过领导干部的充分准备之后，首先在少数骨干分子的整风会议中统一对主要问题的明确认识，再在全体干部中展开讨论，然后作出总结。第四、总结工作检查思想作风，必须抓紧中心，根据可能条件力求解决现存的若干主要问题，不宜牵涉太广、要求太高。对不同部门不同对象，应掌握不同重点并予以具体指示和个别帮助。以上各点在整风轮训班中亦应同样注意掌握。
    此次整风运动开始时，各领导机关一般都表现出事先的准备工作不够充分，如对此次整风方针未作透彻研究，对本部门应解决的问题没有明确了解，同时领导干部的整风报告也多不够及时。因而运动开始时，领导与群众同时摸索，领导上没有比群众走前一步或先行创造典型经验，再去推动一般，以致运动开始阶段，领导上陷于被动，偏差一发生也就往往带普遍性。这个缺点现正逐渐予以克服。特别如浙江、福建两省采取逐级召开党代会或干部会展开整风。南京市先开市委扩大会、党代会，然后各部门展开整风；上海市先在轮训班中作初步酝酿，而后由市委开始逐级召开整风会议，这些步骤都可保证各级领导上能对整风运动作好充分准备。因此也是比较合适的。
  还须克服孤立学习文件和强调检查个人的偏向
    各地整风虽然一般都是采取检查总结工作的方法来进行，并争取于一定时间内完成，以保证土地改革及其他当前任务的执行。但由于对此次整风与历史上两次整风整党的不同环境与不同要求，认识上尚不够清晰，因此在某些方面与某些地方还发生了一些偏差。其中主要的为除少数地方及轮训班外，一般都把学习文件当作一个阶段，且把学习文件时间拖的太长（普通为一个月），以致使整风运动中很长一段时间停留于一般文件学习；其次为个别地方仍以个人为中心进行检讨，或不适当地强调作个人反省个人鉴定，甚至牵扯到历史问题，或者形成钻牛角尖的非政治性的批评，或者形成硬追硬逼局面；此外有的地方则为漫无中心的企图解决所有一切问题。以至时间拉长收效不大，这些偏向也在逐渐纠正中。
  检讨缺点指出成绩注意保护干部工作积极性
    各地经验又证明，由上而下的检查工作，并从检查工作中联系检讨个人的整风方法，确能使干部愉快地改正缺点与错误。但某些地方因为开始时只注意检讨缺点错误，并只注意检讨下级的缺点错误，因此在部分下级干部中曾引起消极或不满情绪。整风中固然是以检讨缺点错误为主，但恰当地指出工作成绩，特别是分析好的典型以为示范是很必要的。这就可使干部不仅看到现在，而且看到将来，不仅知道那些是错误的，而且知道那些是正确的。苏北的启东、海门，苏南的吴江等县，于今年春夏二季总结生产救灾等工作时，曾以评比方法，进行评功检过运动，利用好坏两种典型事例来教育干部，大大提高了干部改正错误改进作风的决心和信心。这种方法亦可应用于乡村干部的整风轮训班，并可作为今后乡村干部经常总结工作改进作风的重要方法之一。在检讨缺点错误时也须首先讲清领导的责任；而对下面的错误，也必须采取实事求是的耐心说服教育的方法，在真象未弄清楚及犯错误者思想未打通之前，不要过早作结论，这样才不致伤害干部的工作积极性，并使整风能收到更大的实际效果。
  加强领导结合工作认真展开批评与自我批评
    在开展批评与自我批评方面，目前存在两种情况：一种情况是领导干部在检讨报告中贯彻高度的自我批评精神起了示范作用，各级骨干大体上都能贯彻这一精神，下面干部则敢于畅所欲言，同时也能够紧紧围绕于工作与政策的执行情况进行检讨，这里批评与自我批评的进行很正常，确实解决了工作中的主要问题。另一种情况是领导干部检讨报告没有很好准备，或缺乏自我批评精神，因而下面同志也就往往漫无中心的泛泛讨论，或者发生极端民主化的倾向，以致走了弯路。这是领导上必须注意掌握的问题。而当后一种情况发生之后，仍应由上而下的进行自我检讨，将群众中所反映出来的主要问题加以分析综合，吸取正确的部分作为补充检讨的重要内容，对不符合实际情况的意见甚至是错误的意见，也应适当地给予必要的解释，切忌运用组织力量或简单生硬的办法去对付下面的批评。
    最后，由于此次整风是在繁重工作任务下进行的，在某些地方还有将工作与整风不能很好配合的偏向，或则把整风时间拉的太长，妨碍了当前各种工作的进行，或则只照顾到其他工作而放松了对整风的领导，使发生的偏向不能及时纠正。这都将使整风难获实际效果，当此整风运动深入展开并将近于结束的时候，加强整风领导，及时总结经验，改正缺点与偏向，使运动获得切实效果，是十分必要的。
