　　Shanghai's Welfare Work for Women and Children
　　Lǔ Méi
　　Since the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Democratic Women's Federation's Women and Children Welfare Committee, thanks to the support and care of the People's Government, the concerted efforts of people from all walks of life, and the hard work of welfare workers, significant progress has been made in welfare work for women and children. Shanghai now has more than 210 various types of women and children's welfare institutions, including 156 nurseries, 32 children's educational institutions, as well as maternal and child health stations, children's sanatoriums, and children's welfare stations.

　　Shanghai's nurseries are divided into factory, busy farming season, neighborhood, and government agency types. Among them, factory nurseries have developed most rapidly, increasing from 36 before liberation to 66 now in the past fourteen months.

　　Before liberation, factory nurseries were mostly decorations of the factories and hardly aimed at benefiting female workers and children. Few nurseries had dedicated personnel in charge, nannies were not trained, and the children of staff members had priority in admission, with very few opportunities for workers' children to be cared for.

　　After liberation, through the rectification and transformation by the Women's Federation and the Women Workers' Department of the Trade Union, factory nurseries truly served the purpose of serving female factory workers. With nurseries available, female workers were freed from the burden of caring for their children, improving the quality and quantity of production. For example, Wang Guizhen, a female worker at China Textile Factory No. 11, increased her daily weaving from more than 20 yards of cloth to more than 30 yards. Xu Gendi used to spin 30 strings of yarn a day, but later she was able to spin 60 strings. According to statistics, there are now more than 3,000 beds in the city's factory nurseries, accommodating more than 4,600 infants in two shifts, day and night. China Textile Factory No. 17 has the most beds (397). In addition to the increase in quantity, nurseries have also increased the supply of milk powder, cod liver oil, and other supplementary foods for children's nutrition. Many nurseries have added equipment and moved into more suitable buildings.

　　To meet the needs of farmers during the busy farming season, Shanghai decided to establish nurseries in the suburbs this spring based on the principle of "run by the people with government assistance." According to statistics before July 15, a total of 17 nurseries were established, accommodating 438 children. Currently, the number has increased to 25, relieving many rural women of their concerns about their children while engaging in production. The rural women in Yaotou Village, Yangsi District, requested one after another: "Don't call it a busy farming season nursery! If it's called a busy farming season nursery, won't it stop operating when farming is not busy?" They hoped that the nursery would be run for a long time.

　　Since the liberation of Shanghai, the number of government agency nurseries has increased to 15, and private nurseries have increased to 54, indicating that the demand for nurseries from working women is also very urgent. The neighborhood nursery stations (children's playgrounds) of the Home Women's Federation now number 11. This is a type of nursery organized by the masses themselves, with housing, funding, and staff all resolved by the women in the neighborhood.

　　There are 32 children's educational institutions in Shanghai, accommodating 3,763 children aged 6 to 16, most of whom are poor orphans and homeless children.

　　Shanghai held its first Maternal and Child Health Exhibition in mid-June, which enabled people from all walks of life to have a more concrete understanding of new and old methods of delivery, and the sound physical and mental development of infants and young children. Following this, maternal and child health work was launched. First, cadres were dispatched to factories. Through free deliveries, health checks for children, vaccinations for smallpox, and injections of diphtheria and pertussis vaccines, the trust of most women was gained, and the enthusiasm of the staff was encouraged. They often explained maternal and infant hygiene knowledge to female workers during breastfeeding time, and often visited workshops and work sheds to communicate through informal conversations, which was widely welcomed by the female workers. The Xujiahui District Maternal and Child Health Station has been established for four months, and a total of 458 workers and poor people from the surrounding area have sought medical treatment, 34 safe deliveries have been performed, and free physical examinations have been provided for more than 480 workers in the vicinity. During the summer epidemic prevention injection campaign, the health station injected more than 16,000 people in one month (accounting for more than 80% of the population of Xujiahui District), laying the foundation for maternal and child health work in the district.

　　In the past year, the Shanghai Home Women's Federation has done a lot of women's service work, receiving more than 600 letters from women asking for inquiries or requesting solutions to problems. Each letter was treated responsibly, and answers and assistance were provided as much as possible. By the end of July this year, it had also accepted 1,522 cases of family disputes and marital disputes, including 562 cases of abuse and 506 cases of bigamy and concubinage. This is a reflection of the semi-feudal, comprador, and bureaucratic capitalist nature of Shanghai's social economy in the past on marriage and family issues. In handling these disputes, the Home Women's Federation conducts persuasion and education to all parties involved based on the principles of equality between men and women in the Marriage Law and family harmony. For cases of bigamy and concubinage, the main focus is on encouraging the female party to first strive for independent living, and not to rashly file for divorce. After mediation and education, because their thinking has been enlightened, 80% of the women request to join the Home Women's Federation as members, and some even become activists.

　　The Shanghai Municipal Women's Federation has gained the following experiences from women and children's welfare work:

　　(1) To promote women and children's welfare work, it is necessary to rely on the masses, jointly exert strength and wisdom, use various working methods and ways, and cooperate fully to solve difficulties. For example, the Xujiahui District Maternal and Child Health Station, the busy farming season nursery, and the neighborhood nursery were all established under the principle of contributing money when available, contributing effort when available, and planning together. Therefore, how to expand and strengthen the unity of women at all levels and absorb the strength of all parties is the key to doing a good job in women and children's welfare work.

　　(2) Actively establishing close contact with relevant parties, jointly consulting and cooperating, and cooperating with each other can easily achieve results. For example, the Shanghai Nursery Undertakings Joint Association contacted the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau and the Health Bureau and jointly improved the work of the nurseries.

　　(3) The Shanghai Women's Federation combined the strength of all parties and successively trained more than 500 nursery staff. After being assigned to their posts, they all played an active leading role and improved the professional level of the nurseries. Therefore, vigorously running training classes and rotation training classes, and cultivating cadres, with sufficient manpower, can further carry out children's care work.

　　(4) Nurseries often hold mothers' meetings to give play to the strength of mothers and strengthen the work of the nurseries, such as discussing various specific issues, reviewing and discussing the income and expenditure of funds, etc. This can strengthen the connection between the nurseries and parents, and ensure that the opinions of the family and the nursery are consistent in the protection and education of children.

　　(5) Always considering the interests of women and reducing the special difficulties of women can gradually improve their political awareness. In order to more widely unite, organize, and improve women, it is necessary to mobilize and give play to all social forces, use all possible conditions, pool the wisdom and efforts of everyone, cooperate with each other, and promote women and children's welfare work forward.

　　上海市的妇女儿童福利工作
    鲁眉
    上海市民主妇联妇女儿童福利委员会成立以来，由于人民政府的扶持和关怀，社会各界人士的群策群力，以及福利工作者辛勤努力的结果，妇女儿童福利工作有了很大的发展。上海市现在已有各种类型的妇女儿童福利机构二百一十余所，其中托儿所一百五十六所，儿童教育机关三十二所，此外还有妇幼保健站，儿童疗养所，儿童福利站等。
    上海的托儿所共分工厂、农忙、里弄、机关等类型。其中以工厂托儿所发展得最为迅速，十四个月来，由解放前的三十六所增加到现在的六十六所。
    解放前的工厂托儿所，大都是工厂的点缀品，谈不上为女工和小孩谋福利。托儿所很少有专人负责，保姆全未受过训练，在受托儿童中，职员的孩子占了优先权，工人的孩子能够得到寄托机会的为数甚少。
    解放后，经过妇联和工会女工部的整顿和改造，使工厂的托儿所真正起了为工厂女工服务的作用。女工们因为有了托儿所，没有了孩子的拖累，提高了生产品的质和量。如中纺十一厂女工王桂珍，从每天织二十多码布增加到三十多码。徐根弟每天摇纺三十串，后来竟能摇到六十串。据统计，现在全市的工厂托儿所共有床位三千余个，日夜两班共收托婴儿四千六百余名。床位最多的是中纺十七厂（三百九十七个）。托儿所除了数量上的增加外，在儿童营养方面，并增加了奶粉、鱼肝油及其他辅食品。许多托儿所增添了设备，而且搬进了更适宜的房子。
    为适应农忙季节农民的要求，上海市于今春开始，决定以“民办公助”的原则，在市郊开办农忙托儿所。据七月十五日以前统计，共办了十七所，收托了四百三十八名小孩，目前已发展到二十五所，解除了不少农妇从事生产时对小孩的顾虑。杨思区耀头村的农妇们，纷纷要求：“不要叫什么农忙托儿所吧！叫农忙托儿所，农事不忙时不是就不办了吗？”她们希望托儿所长期办下去。
    上海解放以来，机关托儿所发展到十五个，私营托儿所增加到五十四所，这说明了职业妇女对托儿所的要求也是非常迫切的。家庭妇女联合会的里弄托儿站（儿童乐园）迄今共有十一站，这是群众自己组织的一种托儿所，房屋、经费和工作人员，都由妇女在里弄里自行解决。
    上海的儿童教育机关共有三十二所，收容六至十六岁的儿童三千七百六十三名，他们大都是贫苦孤儿及流浪儿童。
    上海在六月中旬曾举行了首届妇幼卫生展览会，使各界人民对新老法接生，婴儿、幼儿身心健全发展等方面，有了较具体的认识，随着便展开了妇幼卫生的工作。首先分派干部下厂，通过免费接生，检查儿童健康，布种牛痘，注射白喉、百日咳预防针等工作，取得了大多数妇女的信任，也鼓励了工作人员的热忱。她们常常在女工喂奶时间对女工讲解妇婴卫生常识，并且常常到车间、工房去访问女工，用漫谈聊天的方式进行宣传，获得了女工姐妹的普遍欢迎。徐家汇区妇幼保健站，设立了四个来月，附近工人与贫民前往就诊的共有四百五十八人，安全接产了三十四人，并为附近的四百八十余名工人免费检查体格。在夏令防疫注射运动中，保健站一个月内共注射了一万六千余人（占徐家汇区人口百分之八十强），为该区的妇幼卫生工作打下了基础。
    一年来，上海家庭妇女联合会做了不少的妇女服务工作，共收到六百余封妇女询问或请求解决问题的来信，对每一封信都采取了负责任的态度，尽可能的给与了解答和帮助。到今年七月底止，又接受家庭纠纷和婚姻纠纷事件一千五百二十二件，其中受虐待的共五百六十二件，重婚纳妾的五百零六件。这是由于过去上海社会经济的半封建性、买办性和官僚资本性在婚姻家庭问题上的反映。家庭妇联处理这些纠纷事件，是本着婚姻法男女平等，家庭和睦的原则对有关各方进行说服教育。对重婚纳妾事件，主要是鼓励女方先争取独立谋生，不要轻率的提出离婚。经过调解教育的妇女，因为思想上得到启发，百分之八十都要求参加家庭妇联作会员，有些还成为积极分子。
    上海市妇联从妇女儿童福利工作中得到以下的一些体验：
    （一）推进妇女儿童福利工作，必须依靠群众，共同发挥力量和才智，运用各种各样的工作方法和方式，通力合作，才能解决困难。如徐家汇区妇幼保健站，农忙托儿所，里弄托儿所等，无一不是在有钱出钱，有力出力，共同筹划的原则下产生的。因此，怎样扩大加强各阶层妇女的团结，吸收各方面的力量，是做好妇女儿童福利工作的关键。
    （二）主动与有关方面取得密切联系，共同会商合作，相互配合进行，才容易获得成效。如上海托儿所事业联合会和市民政局、卫生局取得联系，一起改进了托儿所工作。
    （三）上海妇联结合各方面力量，先后训练了五百余个保育员，分配到工作岗位后，都发挥了积极带头作用，提高了托儿所的业务水平。所以，大力开办保训班及轮训班，培养干部，有了足够的人力，才能进一步的开展儿童保育工作。
    （四）托儿所经常召开母亲会，发挥母亲的力量，加强托儿所的工作，如商量各项具体问题，审查并讨论经费收支等，这样可以密切托儿所与家长的联系，并在儿童的保教上，使家庭和托儿所的意见取得一致。
    （五）处处为妇女利益着想，减少妇女的特殊困难，就能逐步提高她们的政治认识。为了更广泛的团结、组织和提高妇女，必须动员和发挥一切社会力量，运用一切可能运用的条件，群策群力，集思广益，互助合作，把妇女儿童福利工作向前推进。
