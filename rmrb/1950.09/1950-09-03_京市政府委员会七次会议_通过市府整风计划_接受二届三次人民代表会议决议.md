[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Committee held its seventh meeting on September 1st. The meeting accepted all the resolutions and proposals of the Third Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference and instructed the General Office of the Municipal Government to forward the cases to the relevant departments of the municipality to formulate specific measures for earnest implementation and to report the progress of implementation to the Municipal Government at any time. The meeting heard and discussed the report of Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu on the plan for the rectification work of the Municipal Government, and unanimously expressed its agreement. It was also decided that after the Municipal Government had heard the opinions of its subordinate committees, bureaus, departments, institutes, banks, and districts, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu would draft a preliminary summary report to be submitted to the next Government Committee meeting for discussion. The meeting discussed and approved the work summary report of the Work Style and Discipline Inspection Committee by Vice Mayor Wu Han and the work summary report of the Second Session of the Third Municipal People's Representative Conference by Secretary-General Xue Zizheng. It also heard the report of Yan Jingqing, Director of the Public Health Bureau, on the current epidemic situation and prevention work of encephalitis in the city. In addition, the meeting also approved several lists of personnel appointments and ratified five separate regulations passed by the Municipal Government's administrative meetings.

Those attending yesterday's meeting included Vice Mayors Zhang Youyu and Wu Han; Government Committee members Luo Ruiqing, Xue Zizheng, Cheng Hongyi, Wang Wenbin, Yan Jingqing, Han Songshang, and Xu Chubo, among others. About twenty people, including heads of municipal government committees, bureaus, departments, institutes, and banks, attended the meeting as observers.

According to the rectification work plan of the Municipal People's Government adopted by this Government Committee, the rectification of the Municipal People's Government this time focuses on summarizing work from top to bottom. Based on Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the various documents of the Second Session of the National Committee of the CPPCC, the important decrees promulgated by the Central People's Government, the Municipal Government's work plan for 1950, and the resolutions of the Municipal and District People's Representative Conferences, we will systematically review the past work. The focus of the review is mainly on the implementation of policies and guidelines and the completion of work tasks, and is related to organizational structure, work system, and style. In terms of principles and policies, the focus is on the following: First, those related to the united front, including the use and education of generally retained staff; Second, those related to the people's democratic dictatorship, including suppressing counter-revolutionaries, establishing a democratic work style, and convening municipal and district people's representative conferences to implement government decrees; Third, those related to financial and economic policies, mainly production and taxation; Fourth, those related to streamlining and reorganization; Fifth, those related to culture, education, and health.

This kind of inspection and summary will first start from the Municipal Government, and then be carried out separately by various bureaus, departments, and district governments. The Municipal Government's leadership has already started this work two weeks ago. Since August 17th, responsible cadres from the municipal government's subordinate committees, bureaus, departments, institutes, banks, districts and other units have begun to study the documents designated by the municipal government, so as to check the work of the municipal government according to the spirit of the documents. The heads of each unit also held discussions and collected opinions among the main cadres of the unit, so as to systematically put forward opinions at the municipal government symposium. Since August 21st, the heads of each unit have been divided into nine groups to hold symposiums at the municipal government, providing various opinions related to the summary of work to the mayor, vice mayors, and secretary-general. Except for the Public Security Bureau, which is scheduled to hold a symposium at the municipal government on the 4th, all other units have already held symposiums at the municipal government. Now, in addition to some problems that the municipal government is immediately addressing, Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu is collecting opinions from all parties, analyzing the situation, and making summaries in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. He is preparing to submit the draft report of this work summary to the next government committee for discussion and approval. Then, he will report on it at the municipal government cadre meeting and distribute it to various units for discussion. The units will then conduct their own inspection and summary based on the summary of the municipal government and launch rectification. Finally, the municipal government will make a comprehensive summary of the rectification. On the one hand, it will affirm the achievements, and on the other hand, it will put forward specific improvement methods for the shortcomings and errors in the work, so as to achieve the goal of rectification of improving cadres and improving work.
