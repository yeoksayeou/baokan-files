Tangshan Desheng Ceramics Factory Accepts Criticism and Improves Products
Editor:

　　On August 8th, the People's Garden published criticisms and suggestions from Comrades Gao Shanming and Xu Zhongyi of the CPC Hangu Town Committee regarding our factory, which we are willing to sincerely accept.

　　The main reason for the decline in the quality of our factory's firebricks is that Tangshan Prefecture suffered severe flooding last year, and a large number of firebricks stored in the factory were submerged for several days, resulting in serious damage to the quality. The raw materials for brick making were also completely washed away. Subsequently, due to urgent demand from all parties, our factory shipped a large quantity of goods to the market, and failed to pay attention to the selection of raw materials. Technical personnel also failed to conduct timely testing of the finished products. In April of this year, after receiving feedback from various factories regarding dissatisfaction with our factory's products, we purchased better raw materials from other places and instructed technical personnel to be responsible for improving product quality. The finished products have now been improved compared to before, and samples have been sent to Heji Factory and other units. In addition to expressing our deep apologies to our customers, we also guarantee that the quality of our firebricks will be excellent in the future, ensuring that they meet the standards.

### 唐山德盛窑业磁厂接受批评提高成品

　　唐山德盛窑业磁厂接受批评提高成品编辑同志：
    八月八日人民园地登载了中共汉沽镇委会高善明、徐中宜同志对本厂的批评和建议，我们愿意诚恳的接受。
    我厂耐火砖品质降低的主要原因是：去年唐山专区遭受严重水灾，大批存厂火砖被浸数日，致使品质受到严重损害。制砖原料亦被冲毁净尽。嗣因各方需求迫切，本厂遂大批出货，供应市场，对原料之选购未能注重，技术人员对成品亦未及时进行试验。今年四月，我们接到各厂对本厂产品不满的反映后，曾向外埠采购了较好的原料，并责成技术人员负责提高产品质量。现在成品已较前改进。并已给合记工厂等单位送去了样品。我厂除对顾主深致歉意外，今后并保证耐火砖出品优良，使之确合标准。
