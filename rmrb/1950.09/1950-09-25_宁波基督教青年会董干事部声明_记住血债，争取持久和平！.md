　　Ningbo YMCA Board of Directors and Staff Statement
    Remember the Blood Debt, Strive for Lasting Peace!
    [Ningbo Dispatch] The Ningbo YMCA Board of Directors, Staff, and all affiliated units issued the following statement on September 13th:
    On this day last year (September 13th), U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes frantically bombed our Ningbo city area. The most bustling areas were turned into rubble. The loss of life and property was incalculable. Even our association (YMCA) and Yongjiang Girls' Middle School, Shengmu Elementary School, Muyi Women's School, Peide Elementary School, as well as Huamei Hospital, Catholic Church, Xinjiang Bridge Public Office, and other cultural institutions and charitable organizations were bombed and destroyed. The scene was unprecedentedly tragic. On this first anniversary of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit planes' ravaging of Ningbo, we reiterate with unparalleled anger our determination to resolutely oppose U.S. imperialist aggression against Taiwan, support the war to liberate Taiwan, and expel the U.S. imperialist air and naval forces from the Taiwan area as soon as possible. We are determined to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's regime.
    Because we have personally witnessed the tragic scenes of the U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek planes bombing over the past year, we are reminded of the Korean people who are currently suffering a thousand times more from the inhuman bombing of U.S. imperialism. In addition to expressing our deep sympathy and heartfelt condolences to them, we must also call on the peace-loving people of the world, regardless of race, gender, or religious belief, to unite together and solemnly sign their names on the peace declaration, expressing our determination to defend world peace. If U.S. imperialism persists in its errors and dares to provoke a new war, then the power of us peace-loving people of the world must inflict a severe blow upon them, forcing U.S. imperialism into the grave and ending the historical mission given to us by the people.
    Ningbo YMCA Board of Directors, Staff, and all affiliated units.

　　宁波基督教青年会董干事部声明
    记住血债，争取持久和平！
    【宁波通信】宁波基督教青年会董干事部暨所属各单位全体同人于九月十三日发出声明如下：
    去年今天（九月十三日）美制蒋机疯狂轰炸我们宁波市区。最热闹的地段，都变成了瓦砾场所。生命财产的损失无法估计，就是本会（青年会）和甬江女中、圣模小学、慕义妇校、培德小学及华美医院、天主堂、新江桥公所等文化机构慈善团体也遭炸毁。景状之惨，为旷古罕见。当此匪机肆虐宁波一周年的今天，我们以无比的愤怒心情，重申我们坚决反对美帝侵略台湾的决心，支持解放台湾战事，提早驱逐美帝海空军出台湾领域。彻底消灭蒋匪帮的政权。
    由于我们以往一年来身历其境亲自看见遭受美制蒋机轰炸的惨状，使我们连想到目前正在遭受美帝全无人道的狂炸，比我们痛苦千百倍的朝鲜人民。我们除对他们表示深切的同情和衷心的慰问外，我们还要呼吁全世界爱好和平的人民，不分种族、性别、宗教信仰，共同团结起来，一致在和平宣言书上郑重地签上自己的名字，表示我们保卫世界和平的决心。如果美帝仍执迷不悟，敢挑起新战争的话，那末我们全世界爱好和平的人民力量，一定要予以严重打击，迫使美帝进入坟墓，结束了历史给我们人民的任务。
    宁波基督教青年会董干事部暨所属各单位全体同人启。
