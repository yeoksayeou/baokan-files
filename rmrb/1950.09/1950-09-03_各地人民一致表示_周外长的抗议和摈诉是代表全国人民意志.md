We firmly support the accusation and recommendations made by our Central People's Government Foreign Minister Zhou to the United Nations and the protest to the United States government. We demand that the United Nations immediately stop the provocative actions of the American planes and withdraw the American troops invading Korea, and support the Soviet proposal for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. We firmly advocate that the United Nations organization must have the legal representatives of the People's Republic of China participate; in resolving the Korean issue, the opinions of the Korean people's representatives must be heard.
            Tong County, Hebei
    This newspaper reports: According to the Tong County area report: All circles in Tong County are angrily protesting the American aggression against our airspace.

Our working class will build the country and also overthrow any beasts that are enemies to us!"
