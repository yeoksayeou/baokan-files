　　Northeast Advanced Producer Zhao Guoyou Improves Tools to Increase Production
　　Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Plant's Lathe Productivity Increases by 285%, Third-Grade Products Completely Eliminated.
　　[Our Newspaper Shenyang News] Northeast advanced producer Zhao Guoyou, after returning to Shenyang from the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in early July, used improved tools and changed labor organization methods to solve the problem of irregular roundness of the lathe's headstock spindle bore. According to statistics on August 25th, work efficiency increased by 285% compared to before the tool improvement, and substandard and third-grade products have been completely eliminated.
　　Since October of last year, although Zhao Guoyou and Zhang Shangju took the lead in setting new records at the plant, and achieved great results in shortening working hours, increasing output, and managing quotas, the quality of products did not improve quickly, and there were many substandard products. In January of this year, the Machinery Industry Bureau of the Northeast People's Government's Industry Department issued quality standards. After several months of effort, by May and June, the lathe had eliminated substandard products. However, the headstock spindle bore (used for the top center, with a taper of 15 degrees and a length of 80 mm or more) was always out of specification. According to regulations, the roundness of the bore over its entire length must be within a tolerance range of 0.01 mm to be a standard product, within 0.02 mm to be a second-grade product, and within 0.03 mm to be a third-grade product. Anything above 0.03 mm was considered a defective product. In the past, the working method was to fix the pointed tool on the lathe's tool post to turn the outer diameter threads and inner tapered bore of the spindle. As a result, the bore's taper always deviated by about 20 "threads" (each "thread" being 0.01 mm). Therefore, after finishing, it was necessary to slowly scrape it by hand with a scraper, but it was difficult to apply even force by hand, and even a slight tremor would cause a deviation of 4 or 5 "threads," making it difficult to meet standards, delaying time, and reducing output.
　　As soon as Zhao Guoyou returned to the factory, he resolutely accepted this arduous task, determined to make the bore conform to specifications. Initially, he tried to do it using the previous methods, but failed; the tolerance was still 10 to 20 "threads." So he and six fellow workers in the team researched how to improve operating procedures or invent better tools. Zhao Guoyou suggested that scraping with a scraper was unscientific, and it would be better to fix a finishing tool on the lathe's tool post and let it run the taper itself. They tried it, and the situation was good. During the experiment, they also studied the roundness of the bearings. In the past, people always thought that if the lathe was out of specification, it was because the bearings were faulty, but no one knew exactly how much the bearings could be off before they were considered unusable. This time, they researched and found that: if the bearing's roundness tolerance is within 0.5 "threads," it guarantees standard products; within 0.75 "threads," it guarantees second-grade products; and at 1 "thread," it is a third-grade product. Because they wanted to eliminate third-grade products, bearings that were off by 1 "thread" were considered unqualified and could not be installed on the lathe. This ensured the quality of the lathe.
　　Zhao Guoyou also improved the method of grinding the top center. Previously, grinding the top center involved setting up a small grinding wheel on a large frame. Because the large frame was unstable, it required two unskilled workers to hold it, and a master craftsman had to do it himself, and it still took more than three grindings to complete. Now, a small grinder is used, mounted on the tool post, using a quarter-horsepower electric roller to drive a larger grinding wheel. This saves two unskilled workers, can be completed in just one grinding, and can be done by apprentices, saving the master craftsman's time.
　　In terms of labor organization, they implemented a scientific division of labor, dividing the process into three stages based on technical skill and proficiency: roughing, threading, and finishing the bore. Zhao Guoyou was elected as the production team leader, and he and a fellow worker were responsible for finishing the bore. This formed a regular assembly line division of labor and rationally allocated labor. As a result, work efficiency was greatly improved. Previously, an average of seven or eight people were doing the work, and the assembly workers were chasing the lathe workers. Now only six people are doing it, but production has increased by 60%, and instead the lathe workers are chasing the assembly workers.
　　As a result of Zhao Guoyou's improved tools and labor organization, output and quality increased month by month. In June, the plant worked a total of 1614 hours and completed 21 lathes, averaging 77 hours per lathe. In July, a total of 720 hours were worked, completing 25 lathes, averaging 29 hours per lathe. Standard products accounted for 64% in July, an increase of 16.5% compared to 47.5% in June. From August 1st to 25th, a total of 520 hours were worked, completing 26 units, an average of 20 hours per unit, a 285% increase in work efficiency compared to June and a 45% increase compared to July. Third-grade and substandard products have been completely eliminated.

　　东北先进生产者赵国有改进工具提高生产
    沈阳第三机器厂车床生产率较前提高百分之二百八十五，三级品已完全消灭。
    【本报沈阳讯】东北先进生产者赵国有七月初从北京参加人民政协第二次全国委员会回沈后，用改进工具和改变劳动组织的办法，使该厂车床主轴哨孔圆转不规矩的现象得到解决，据八月二十五天的统计，工作效率较改进工具前提高百分之二百八十五，下级品和三级品已经完全消灭。
    该厂去年十月以来，虽经赵国有、张尚举带头创新纪录，在缩短工时，增加产量及定额管理方面收到很大成绩，但对产品质量却提高不快，下级品很多。今年一月东北人民政府工业部机械工业管理局颁布了质量标准，经几个月来的努力，到五、六月份车床已经消灭了下级品，但床头主轴哨孔（按顶尖用的，斜度是十五度，长八十毫米以上）总是做的不合规格。按规定，哨孔全长度的圆转，公差范围在百分之一毫米以内者为标准品，百分之二以内者为二级品，百分之三以内者为三级品，百分之三以上者即为不良品。过去的工作方法是把尖刀架在车床的刀架上，来车主轴的外经丝扣和里孔哨度，结果哨孔斜度每次总是差二十道左右（每一道为百分之一毫米）。因此做完后必须用手拿着刮刀慢慢刮，可是手使劲不容易均匀，稍一颤动就差四、五道，既难合标准，又延误时间，减少产量。
    赵国有刚刚回到工厂，就毅然接受了这一艰巨的任务，决心把哨孔做到合乎规矩。最初他用以前的方法去作，失败了，公差仍达十到二十道。于是他就和小组里六名工友在一起研究，怎样改善操作规程或发明良好工具。赵国有提出用刮刀刮是最不科学的，不如把光刀也架在车床刀架上，让它自己走哨。他们一试验，情形良好。在试验中，他们又研究出滚珠的圆转情形。以前人们的思想总认为车床一不合规格，就是滚珠有毛病，但究竟滚珠差多少才算不合用，谁也不知道。这次他们研究出：滚珠圆转公差在半道范围以内，保证出标准品，在○点七五道以内保证出二级品；达一道时则是三级品。因为要消灭三级品，所以差一道的滚珠就认为不合格，不能向床子上装。这样就保证了车床的质量。
    磨顶尖的方法也经赵国有改进了。以前磨顶尖是在大架子上架个小砂轮，因为大架子不稳，需要两个杂工把着，由老师傅亲自动手，还得磨三次以上，才能完成。现在改用一个小研磨机架在刀架上，用四分之一马力的电滚，带动较大的砂轮，这样省去两名杂工，只磨一回就可以成功，徒工也可以做，省去老师傅的工时。
    在劳动组织上，他们进行了科学的分工，按技术高低及熟练程度，分车荒、挑扣、光哨孔三道工序。赵国有被推举为生产小组长，他和一个工友管光哨孔。这样就形成了正规的流水式分工，合理分配了劳动力。于是工作效率大大提高，从前每月平均七、八个人做活，是装配工人追车工，现在只有六人做，而产品增加了百分之六十，反而车工追装配工人了。
    赵国有改进工具和改进劳动组织的结果，产量质量逐月上升。六月份该厂共作了一千六百十四小时，完成二十一台车床，平均每台合七十七小时。七月份共作了七百二十小时，完成二十五台车床，平均每台降为二十九小时。七月份标准品占百分之六十四，较六月份的百分之四十七点五提高了百分之十六点五。八月份到二十五日止，计用工时五百二十小时，完成二十六台，每台平均再降为二十小时，工作效率比六月份提高百分之二百八十五，比七月份提高百分之四十五。三级品和下级品完全消灭了。
