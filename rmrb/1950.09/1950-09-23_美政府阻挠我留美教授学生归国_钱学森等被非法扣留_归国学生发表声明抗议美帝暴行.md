　　The U.S. Government Obstructs Return of Chinese Professors and Students Studying in the U.S.
    Qian Xuesen and Others Illegally Detained
    Returned Students Issue Statement Protesting U.S. Imperialist Atrocities
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 22nd. Another group of 111 Chinese students who had been studying in the United States and returned to the motherland due to the oppression of the U.S. government arrived in Guangzhou on the 20th of this month. According to them, they encountered various obstacles from the U.S. government before their departure. After several months of struggle, they finally left the U.S. on the "Wilson" ship to return to China. However, Dr. Qian Xuesen, an expert in mechanics who planned to return to China, was detained by the U.S. government before he could depart. When the "Wilson" ship arrived in Yokohama, Japan, Professor Zhao Zhongyao, an atomic physicist also returning on the same ship, along with Luo Shijun and Shen Shanjiong, two students studying science and engineering, were illegally detained by the U.S. occupation authorities. All the returning students expressed extreme indignation at this atrocity of U.S. imperialism. After arriving in Guangzhou, they issued a letter to their compatriots, stating: "We hereby report to the people of the country with the utmost indignation the circumstances under which three of our compatriots were unreasonably detained by the U.S. Department of the Army in Yokohama Port, Japan: When the ship arrived in Los Angeles on August 28, Professor Zhao Zhongyao was repeatedly questioned and his luggage searched by immigration officials, and almost all of his books were confiscated. On September 12, when the ship arrived in Yokohama, Japan, the U.S. Eighth Army stationed in Japan unreasonably detained Professor Zhao Zhongyao, as well as students Luo Shijun and Shen Shanjiong. On September 17, when the ship arrived in Manila, Philippines, student Bao Wenkui's luggage was inspected by U.S. special agents for four hours, but fortunately, it was not confiscated. All of our students are extremely angry at this action of the U.S. Department of the Army in illegally detaining our scholars and returning students by force. In addition to reporting the above situation to our Central People's Government, we have also lodged a serious protest with the U.S. State Department."

　　美政府阻挠我留美教授学生归国
    钱学森等被非法扣留
    归国学生发表声明抗议美帝暴行
    【新华社广州二十二日电】因不堪美国政府压迫而返回祖国的我国留美学生，又有一批一百一十一人于本月二十日返抵广州。据谈，他们启程前曾受到美国政府多方阻难，经过几个月的奋斗，终于乘“威尔逊”号轮船离美返国，但拟回国的力学专家钱学森博士于动身前竟被美国政府扣留。当“威尔逊”号驶到日本横滨时，同轮返国的原子物理学家赵忠尧教授及学习理工的罗时钧、沈善炯二位学生竟又遭美国占领当局的非法扣押。全体回国学生对美帝国主义此种暴行极表愤慨。他们抵穗后发表了告同胞书，内称：“我们谨以最愤慨的心情，向国人报告三位同胞在日本横滨港遭美国陆军部无理拘留的经过：八月二十八日轮船到洛杉矶时，赵忠尧教授被移民局职员再三盘问和搜查行李，书籍几被全部扣留。九月十二日船到日本横滨时，美国驻日本占领军第八军，竟无理将赵忠尧教授及罗时钧、沈善炯两同学扣押。九月十七日船到菲律宾马尼拉时，鲍文奎同学复被美国特务检查行李历四小时，幸未被扣。我全体同学对这次美国陆军部借武力非法扣押我国学者和归国同学的行动，极为愤怒。我们除将上述情况报告我中央人民政府外，并向美国国务院提出严重抗议。”
