Xinhua News Agency, 7th: Since our Foreign Minister Zhou twice lodged complaints with the United Nations Security Council regarding the provocative acts of US invading Korean army aircraft violating our country's airspace and killing and wounding our people, the US representative to the Security Council, Austin, initially in his speech at the Security Council meeting on August 31, suggested that the United Nations establish a committee to conduct investigations, and then on September 1 formally suggested that the Security Council establish an India-Sweden committee to conduct on-site investigations.

An authoritative source here believes that the provocative incident of US aircraft occurred in China, and China is the victim and the complainant in this provocation. Therefore, when the Security Council handles this complaint case, it should first consider inviting a Chinese representative to participate in the discussion. Only in this way will it conform to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, because Article 32 of the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates that a state which is a party to a dispute under the consideration of the Security Council shall be invited to participate in the discussion relating to the dispute. This gives Chinese people ample reason to believe that any measures or resolutions taken by the Security Council on this issue without the participation of a Chinese representative in the discussion, including the organization of a committee to conduct on-site investigations, are illegal and contrary to the principles of the United Nations Charter, and are of course unacceptable to the Chinese people.

The authoritative source here also stated that the crimes of US invading Korean army aircraft intruding into our country's airspace and slaughtering Chinese people are not only a deliberate provocation by US imperialism against China's complete territorial sovereignty, but also a malicious conspiracy by them to use the Korean War to expand the war of aggression and undermine peace. Therefore, the effective measure to resolve this problem should be to accept the just proposal of our Foreign Minister Zhou to "sanction such provocative and brutal acts by the US invading Korean army of intruding into Chinese airspace, and should immediately take measures to completely withdraw the US invading army from Korea, so as to avoid the expansion of the situation and facilitate the peaceful mediation of the Korean issue by the United Nations."

　　北京权威人士声称：
    安理会受理美机侵我领空案必须邀请我国代表参加讨论
    指出解决这一问题的有效措施是接受我周外长建议
    【新华社七日讯】自我国周外长两次就美国侵略朝鲜军队飞机侵犯我国领空和杀伤我国人民的挑衅行为，向联合国安全理事会提出控诉以后，美国驻安理会代表奥斯汀，初则在八月三十一日安理会会议的发言中，建议联合国成立一个委员会，进行调查，继则于九月一日正式建议安理会建立印度——瑞典委员会从事实地调查。
    此间权威人士认为：美国飞机的挑衅事件发生在中国，中国乃是受害的当事国和对于这次挑衅的控诉者，因此，安理会在受理这一控诉案时，首先应该考虑的是邀请中国代表参加讨论。唯有如此，才符合于联合国宪章的精神，因为联合国宪章第三十二条明明白白地规定，安理会在考虑中的争端的当事国，应被邀参加关于该项争端的讨论。这就使中国人民有充分的理由认为：安理会在没有中国代表参加讨论的情况下对这一问题所采取的任何措施或决议，包括组织委员会进行实地调查在内，都是非法的，与联合国宪章的原则相背的，这当然是中国人民所不能接受的。
    此间权威人士又称，美国侵略朝鲜军队飞机侵入我国领空和残杀中国人民的罪行，不仅是美帝国主义对中国完整的领土主权的有意挑衅，而且是它们企图利用朝鲜战事扩大侵略战争并破坏和平的恶毒阴谋。因此，解决这一问题的有效措施，应当是接受我国周外长的正义建议，“制裁美国侵略朝鲜军队的这种侵入中国领空的挑衅和残暴行为，并应立即采取措施，使美国政府完全撤退其在朝鲜的侵略军队，以免事态扩大，并有利于联合国和平调处朝鲜问题”。
