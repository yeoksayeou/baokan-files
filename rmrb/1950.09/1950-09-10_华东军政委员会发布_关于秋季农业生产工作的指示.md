    Instructions on Autumn Agricultural Production Work

    [East China News Agency Dispatch] The 26th administrative meeting of the East China Military and Political Committee passed the "Instructions on Autumn Agricultural Production Work," the full text of which is as follows:

    (1) Autumn harvests have begun successively in various parts of East China. Except for most of northern Anhui and parts of northern Jiangsu, which suffered severe floods, and individual areas that suffered from drought and waterlogging, most areas have reported a good harvest. This is the result of the arduous struggle, overcoming disasters, and diligent labor of the people of East China over the past year. People's governments at all levels should mobilize the masses to resolutely protect the autumn harvest, strictly guard against the conspiracies and sabotage of hidden bandits, secret agents, and lawless elements. All acts of theft that undermine production should be prohibited, and a social order should be established to ensure that farmers' harvests are not subject to any infringement.

    (2) In areas where autumn plowing can be carried out, efforts should be made to plow early and plow more, and to plant wheat, barley, rapeseed, peas, and other autumn and winter crops in a timely manner. Wheat planting should generally involve seed selection and seed soaking. In all areas suitable for planting green manure, purple alfalfa and alfalfa should be planted in a timely manner to increase fertilization. Cotton-producing areas should plan to reserve land for increased cotton planting. The people's government's policy of protecting labor production must be resolutely implemented. Whoever cultivated the land this spring and summer must still harvest it this autumn. In areas where land reform has not been announced, the "East China New Area Rent Reduction Regulations" must be followed for rent reduction. In areas where land reform is announced to be implemented this autumn and winter, the principle of "whoever sows, reaps" for this autumn and winter crops must be resolutely implemented for continued cultivation; or the land recipients should compensate the original cultivators for all cultivation and fertilization costs before the land allocation; or, with the consent of both the original cultivators and the land recipients, the harvest should be divided according to the rent reduction standard to facilitate autumn plowing and planting. All localities must conduct extensive, in-depth, and repeated publicity on the above policies to eliminate farmers' concerns about production.

    (3) Before the new grain is on the market, in order to reduce the losses of poor farmers who eat green crops or sell unripe crops, the People's Bank, state-owned trading agencies, and cooperatives should formulate plans to solve the current difficulties of farmers by adopting methods such as mortgage loans and pre-purchase of autumn grain. After the new grain is on the market, agricultural products should be purchased in a planned and timely manner. During the autumn purchase, state-owned trading agencies in various localities should effectively grasp the prices of major agricultural products, carry out purchases in a timely manner, and resolutely guarantee the proper prices of agricultural products, so as to avoid low grain prices hurting farmers, and should resolutely implement the State Council's regulations on using industrial raw materials to offset grain taxes and reasonable price ratios.

    (4) Conscientiously promote the mass seed selection movement, and organize the masses to select, retain, and exchange seeds in large quantities. Continue to carry forward the achievements of the pest control movement. In rice-producing areas, implement the work of eliminating rice borers, thoroughly remove rice roots, and kill rice borers and eggs. In wheat-producing areas, pay attention to preventing and controlling underground pests, wheat smut, and nematode diseases. In cotton-producing areas, pay attention to preventing and controlling leaf rollers, cutworms, and pink bollworms. In addition, for existing late-autumn crops and cotton fields, continue to weed, control pests, and resist drought to strive for greater harvests. Technical personnel of agricultural departments should go deep into the masses, summarize mass experience, and provide technical guidance; and can hold special cadre meetings and model worker meetings to impart technology and promote intensive cultivation.

    (5) In disaster areas, lead the masses to actively replant autumn and winter crops; expand the wheat planting area as much as possible, and vigorously protect draught cattle. In the Huai River flood area of northern Anhui, the principle of focusing on agricultural production should be further implemented, actively leading the masses to drain water, block breaches, and sow autumn and winter crops in a timely manner, and develop various sideline productions in a planned way to combine relief and resettlement of disaster victims. At the same time, make good preparations for various water control projects, so as to strive for the early commencement of water control projects. In bumper harvest areas, advocate cherishing the fruits of labor, practicing strict economy to prepare for famine, investing in production, and conducting long-term production and construction education, so as to prevent possible waste after the autumn harvest.

    (6) The tasks during this autumn harvest period are particularly heavy. Not only must autumn harvesting, autumn plowing, autumn planting, and autumn tax collection be carried out, but also, before the autumn flood season has passed along the rivers, lakes, seas, and inland rivers, flood prevention work must still be carried out vigorously. At the same time, the work of rent reduction and land reform must be closely combined with autumn tax collection and autumn production. Leading organs at all levels must concentrate their efforts to strengthen leadership, and hold cadre meetings, people's representative meetings at all levels, and farmer representative meetings in districts and townships, to plan autumn harvesting, autumn tax collection, and land reform work in a planned way, so that various tasks are closely combined, promote each other, and are fully grasped, so as not to lose sight of one thing while attending to another.

　　华东军政委员会发布
    关于秋季农业生产工作的指示
    【华东新闻局讯】华东军政委员会二十六次行政会议，通过“关于秋季农业生产工作的指示”，全文如下：
    （一）华东各地均先后开始秋收，全区除皖北大部及苏北一部遭受严重水灾及个别地区遭受水旱灾外，一般地区均告丰收，这是华东人民一年来艰苦奋斗，战胜灾荒，辛勤劳动的果实，各级人民政府应发动群众坚决保卫秋收，严防隐藏的土匪特务与不法分子的阴谋破坏。并应禁止一切破坏生产的偷盗行为，建立保障农民收获不受任何侵害的社会秩序。
    （二）凡能进行秋耕的地区，应尽量争取早耕、多耕，及时种好小麦、大麦、油菜、豌豆等秋冬作物，种小麦应普遍进行选种、浸种。对一切适宜种植绿肥地区应及时种好紫云英、苜蓿，增加施肥量。产棉地区应有计划地留出增植棉花的土地。必须坚决执行人民政府保护劳动生产的政策。凡今年春夏由谁耕种者，今秋必须仍归谁收割。在未宣布实行土改之地区必须遵照“华东新区减租条例”进行减租。在宣布今年秋冬实行土地改革的地区，应坚决执行今年秋冬作物仍按谁种谁收的原则继续耕种；或由得地户偿还原耕户在分配土地以前一切耕作与施肥的全部成本；或在原耕户与得地户双方同意下，于收获时按减租标准，双方分益，以利秋耕秋种。各地对上述政策必须作广泛深入反复的宣传，以消除农民对生产的顾虑。
    （三）在新谷未登场之前，为了减少贫苦农民吃青、卖青的损失，人民银行、国营贸易机关、合作社应制订计划，采用抵押贷款及预购秋粮等办法，解决农民的目前困难。在新谷登场之后，应有计划的及时收购农产品。在秋季收购中，各地国营贸易机关，应切实掌握主要农产品牌价，及时进行收购，坚决保证农产品的正当价格，以免谷贱伤农，并应坚决执行政务院公布的工业原料顶交公粮及合理比价的规定。
    （四）认真推行群众选种运动，大量组织群众选种留种换种。继续发扬治虫运动的成绩，在产稻区应贯彻灭螟工作，彻底刨除稻根、杀灭螟虫和卵子，产麦区应注意防除地下害虫、小麦黑穗病及线虫病。产棉区应注意防除卷叶虫、金钢钻、红铃虫等。此外对现有晚秋作物及棉田，应继续除草、除虫、抗旱，争取多收。农业部门的技术人员应深入群众，总结群众经验，进行技术指导；并可召开专门的干部会、劳模会，传授技术，提倡精耕细作。
    （五）被灾地区，应领导群众，积极补种秋冬作物；尽可能扩大种麦面积，并应大力保护耕牛。皖北沿淮水灾区，更应贯彻以农业生产为主的方针，积极领导群众排水、堵口、及时播种秋冬作物，有计划地展开各种副业生产，以结合救济和安置灾民的工作。同时，应作好有关治水工程的各项准备工作，以便争取治水工程早日开工。在丰收地区应提倡爱惜劳动果实，厉行节约备荒，投资生产，进行长期生产建设教育，以防止秋收后可能发生的浪费现象。
    （六）今年秋收期间任务特别繁重，不但须进行秋收、秋耕、秋种、秋征，沿江、河、湖、海及内河附近，在秋汛期未过前，仍须大力进行防汛工作。同时，必须使减租、土改工作与秋征及秋季生产密切结合。各级领导机关必须集中力量加强领导，并开好干部会、各界人民代表会及区乡农民代表会，有计划地布置秋收、秋征及土地改革工作，使各种工作密切结合，互相推动，全面掌握，不致顾此失彼。
