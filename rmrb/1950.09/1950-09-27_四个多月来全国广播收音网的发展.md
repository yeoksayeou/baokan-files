　　The Development of National Radio Broadcast Networks in the Past Four Months
　　Huang ?
　　Since the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Establishing Radio Broadcast Networks" on April 22 this year, radio broadcast networks have begun to be established nationwide in just over four months. Currently, 24 provinces, 4 administrative offices, and 38 large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas with radio stations have established or are in the process of establishing radio broadcast networks in the six major administrative regions, 28 provinces, 8 administrative offices, and 1 autonomous region nationwide. In some areas, radio reception work has already achieved considerable results.

　　After the Press Administration issued the decision to establish radio broadcast networks, the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau issued the "Notice to People's Radio Stations on Implementing the Press Administration's Decision on Establishing Radio Broadcast Networks" on April 26, specifically stipulating that local People's Radio Stations should formulate plans for establishing radio networks based on local conditions. In order to carry out radio network work, the Central People's Broadcasting Station specially added a "Radio Listener Liaison Section" in early May to begin radio listener registration. As of early September, a total of 335 radio listeners had been registered. In addition, as of September 7, 471 units, including local government agencies, schools, and factories, had organized listening to the Central Station's social science lectures and had direct contact with the station, involving approximately 86,000 people. The station is now planning to systematically establish radio networks in factories and schools across the country in order to more effectively organize listening to programs related to workers and education, so as to achieve the goal of everyone running "radio universities" and carrying out social education.

　　Party and government leading organs at all levels have also attached great importance to the Press Administration's decision to establish radio broadcast networks. In the past four months, the Cultural Department of the Northeast People's Government, the Central-South Military and Political Committee, the East China Military and Political Committee, the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the Southwest Military and Political Committee, and 14 provincial people's governments and people's administrative offices in Hebei, Chahar, Pingyuan, Suiyuan, Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaodong, Liaoxi, Rehe, Guangdong, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Southern Jiangsu District; as well as five people's municipal governments in Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Changchun, Anshan, and Qingdao; the Xiamen Military Control Commission; and the Qiqihar Bureau of Culture and Education have successively issued circulars or instructions on establishing radio broadcast networks. In order to make local Party organizations attach importance to the work of establishing radio broadcast networks and to establish radio broadcast networks in local Party organs, the Northeast Bureau, East China Bureau, Central-South Bureau, Northwest Bureau, and South China Sub-Bureau of the Communist Party of China, as well as the provincial and district Party committees of Shanxi, Rehe, Hubei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Southern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Yunnan, and Guizhou, and the municipal Party committees of seven cities, including Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Nanjing, Qingdao, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Kunming, have also successively issued instructions and notices on establishing radio networks.

　　In general, the establishment of radio broadcast networks in various provinces begins with the appointment of radio listeners by local leading organs or the solicitation of radio listeners by local people's radio stations, followed by a period of radio reception training, and then distribution to various places to work. In the past four months, the number of radio listeners has increased rapidly. According to incomplete statistics from 15 provinces, there are a total of 1,625 full-time and part-time radio listeners, of which 511 are in the five provinces of North China, and Hebei Province alone has 238 radio listeners in 119 counties, 3 cities, and 8 towns. In addition, the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army has also equipped 200 full-time radio listeners, who are preparing to be assigned to various divisions and regiments of the Fourth Field Army to be responsible for listening work. At present, the radio listeners in the five provinces of North China have all been trained and have already started working; radio listeners in some provinces in the Northeast, such as Jilin and Rehe, have also completed their training; radio listeners in the six provinces of Hubei, Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Jiangxi in the Central-South region began training in July and August, and the training work in the entire region is expected to be completed by the end of September. Some areas in East China, such as Zhejiang Province, Shandong Province, Fujian Province, and Northern Jiangsu District, have also begun training radio listeners. The training of radio listeners in Northern Anhui District was completed in June. The entire East China region is preparing to complete the radio listener training work before the land reform this autumn and winter.

　　The main work of county radio listeners is to transcribe important news and policy decrees from the national, large administrative region, and provincial levels, and send them to local Party and government leading organs, which then select and print them for relevant departments to guide various tasks. The Chahar Provincial People's Government's "Decision on Using Radio Stations to Convey and Implement Policies and Decrees," issued on May 13, clearly stipulated that all important instructions, decisions, orders, and notices of the provincial government should be sent to the Zhangjiakou People's Station for broadcast and have the same validity as documents. In addition, most radio listeners are also responsible for organizing cadres and the masses to listen to other various programs, such as worker programs, women's programs, and lecture programs.

　　The main task of urban radio listeners is to organize various factories, government agencies, organizations, schools, and people from all walks of life to listen to various broadcasts. In this regard, the People's Radio Stations in many large and medium-sized cities have achieved considerable success. According to statistics from seven cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Jinan, Wuxi, and Anshan, there are 140 wired broadcasting stations inside factories. In addition to rebroadcasting certain programs from local People's Radio Stations every day, these factory broadcasting stations also broadcast news, notices, and other information within the factory, becoming strongholds of urban radio networks. In addition, People's Radio Stations in large and medium-sized cities have also organized thousands of listeners around various programs. Taking the Northeast as an example, the Northeast People's Radio Station has already organized 100,000 listeners to listen to broadcasts. The Qiqihar People's Station in Songjiang Province, on the one hand, solicited 200 radio listeners, and on the other hand, established listening organizations in 15 counties, 2 cities, and 1 mining area, including a total of 140 government agencies and organizations. In July, the Shenyang People's Station organized 3,556 women's listening groups, totaling 50,719 people, among urban women who had previously been unorganized, to listen to the station's "Women's Time," and many active radio listeners emerged from these groups. In the East China region, the Shanghai People's Radio Station alone had approximately 130,000 organized listeners who listened to the Shanghai Education Union's lecture programs and the "History of Social Development" broadcast course organized by the Municipal Federation of Students' Committees; children's programs organized 510 schools, totaling more than 56,000 listeners. From late June to the end of July, the Qingdao People's Radio Station organized more than 1,500 children's listening groups in just over a month, with more than 10,000 young people and children participating in listening.

　　The work of establishing radio broadcast networks nationwide, which began universally in the past four months, has not only achieved the above-mentioned results, but also enabled the People's Radio Stations to play a significant role in various tasks and the political and cultural life of the broad masses of the people in areas where radio networks have already been established.

　　Due to the widespread establishment of radio broadcast networks, it has been proven that radio broadcasting is one of the best tools for transmitting decrees, instructions, and notices from governments at all levels and for guiding work in a timely manner. For example, the decrees, instructions, and notices of various departments of the Chahar Provincial People's Government can be broadcast every day, and after being transcribed by radio listeners, they are quickly disseminated to various counties and even districts, greatly improving administrative efficiency. The Huxi Special District of Pingyuan Province listened to the provincial government's summer tax notice and immediately posted it on seven blackboards in the city of Shan County, with approximately 200 people reading it every day. For example, when the trade union in the district was discussing the commemoration of "May Day" and was worried about not having materials for publicity, it immediately solved the difficulty by listening to the central government's slogans commemorating "May Day." This year, the Taiyuan People's Radio Station broadcast a letter instructing on spring plowing inspection. The Qi County radio listener transcribed it and sent it to the person in charge, which timely guaranteed the spring plowing inspection work. After listening to the radio directly helped their work, many local leading organs wrote letters to the radio station to establish contact. The Rongcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei said in a letter to the Baoding Station that when they were preparing for the three-level election deployment work, they immediately mimeographed and distributed the key points of village election propaganda to various villages, which played a timely guiding role in the village election work. Wen'an, Jinghai, Dacheng, and Linqing counties in the province also mentioned in letters to the radio station that they completed their work ahead of schedule because they listened to the radio.

　　Through the radio broadcast network, important domestic and foreign news that occurs every day can be quickly transmitted to various counties and districts, enabling the counties and districts to conduct current affairs and policy explanations in a timely manner, which has also greatly promoted work and improved the people's political awareness. In Penghu, Yongchun County, Fujian Province, there is a middle school principal who is now a radio listener for the Central People's Broadcasting Station. When the area was not liberated a year ago, he often posted news from the Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station on the wall newspaper. People in many villages and towns near Yongchun, Datian, and Dehua counties relied on this radio listener to understand major domestic and foreign events. In Shashi, Hubei, a newspaper called "Broadcast News" is now published. Its predecessor was the "Shashi Daily." This newspaper is a small, lead-printed daily with two pages in octavo, which is publicly issued and subscribed to. The content of the newspaper mainly relies on transcribing the main news from the Central People's Broadcasting Station and the Central-South People's Broadcasting Station. The text is simple and concise, and is very popular with readers. Small daily newspapers of the same nature also exist in Yidu County, Hubei. In addition, there are more mimeographed small newspapers in various counties that rely on radio news as a source, such as "News Broadcast" in Hunyuan County, Chahar, "Broadcast Express" in Right Jade, and "People's Broadcast" in Dehua. In Pingyuan Province, 18 counties have such mimeographed small newspapers. Blackboards and rooftop broadcasts connected by radio listeners have played a significant role in disseminating important news. For example, after receiving the news of the victory on Hainan Island, Zhuolu County organized 63 blackboards for publicity, which immediately spread the victory news to villages and towns. In Shan County in the Huxi Special District of Pingyuan Province, in April and May of this year, special agents spread many rumors. The local leading organs mobilized all the radio listeners in the city to listen to the news of the liberation of Hainan Island and the Zhoushan Islands, posted it on blackboards, and printed and distributed more than 3,000 victory reports, which effectively打击打击打击破坏分子的造谣。 According to statistics in June, 45 units in Pingyuan Province had published news from listening on blackboards, 17 counties sent it to cultural centers, and 12 counties conducted rooftop broadcasts. For example, the recent peace signature campaign has also been greatly developed through the radio broadcast network. For example, it was not well developed among the Hui people in Tangshan, but after the Tangshan People's Radio Station invited Mr. Bai Ziming, a representative of the Hui people, to give a speech, more than 3,000 Hui people in the city signed the next day. Students in night schools in Jinzhou organized to listen to the Jinzhou People's Radio Station's broadcast on the peace signature campaign, and more than 5,000 people immediately signed their names.

　　In terms of social education, whether it is helping cadres learn or improving the cultural level of the broad masses of the people, organizing listening to broadcasts has also shown remarkable results. The social science lectures organized by the Central People's Broadcasting Station have not only helped many government agencies, organizations, cadres, and young people who are keen to learn solve the difficulties of not having teachers and not being able to understand books, but also become organizers for a large number of listeners, enabling cadres in various places to listen on time and complete their study plans on a regular basis. Some People's Radio Stations also have more programs of the same nature, or rebroadcast programs from the Central Station, which are equally popular. The Baoding Station not only rebroadcasts the Central Station's social science lectures, but also invites experts to supplement and explain some of the problems, which is more helpful to the cadres in various counties in Hebei. Listeners from Tianjin and Luan County wrote to say that these issues were issues they had been arguing about endlessly, and requested that more people be invited to explain them in the future. The natural science lectures organized by the Central Station and various People's Radio Stations also have many listeners. When the Baoding Station in Hebei broadcast "Lunar Eclipse," more than 140 cadres and the masses in Qi County alone listened to it, and everyone stayed up that day waiting to see the lunar eclipse. The masses in Changyuan County said after listening to the broadcast: "The People's Liberation Army is really capable, they know everything. Now I know that the lunar eclipse is really not the Black Evil God eating the moon."

　　It is very obvious that listening to the radio has gradually become closely linked to the lives of the broad masses of the people. For example, the Chahar People's Radio Station and the Provincial Health Department jointly organized a special program in April this year to "Prevent the Recurrence of Plague in Chahar Province," and all counties in the province organized medical and health personnel and students to listen. After listening, the students in Wanquan immediately set off to promote the streets, and the county quickly restored the organization of the epidemic prevention committee, and government cadres and organized masses all underwent epidemic prevention injections. Many People's Radio Stations' social service programs, which specialize in answering various questions from listeners, are generally welcomed by the people. In addition, radio art and literature programs have become an indispensable part of the cultural and entertainment life of many cadres and the masses. Cadres and the masses not only want to listen to news and lectures, but also like to listen to various entertainment programs, various local operas, and folk songs. They learn many songs and dramas from listening to the radio.

　　The work of establishing radio broadcast networks nationwide has only been carried out for more than four months, but judging from its impact and role, we can already foresee that after the universal establishment of radio networks nationwide in the near future, a new situation will emerge in China's people's broadcasting industry. Broadcasting work will play a greater role in improving the efficiency of our entire national work and the cultural life of the people.

　　四个多月来全国广播收音网的发展
    黄?
    今年四月二十二日，中央人民政府新闻总署发布了《关于建立广播收音网的决定》以后，在短短的四个多月中，全国范围内已经开始建立了广播收音网。现在，全国六大行政区二十八省八个行署一自治区，已经有二十四省、四个行署和三十八个有广播台的大中城市及工矿区都建立了、或者正在建立广播收音网。在若干地区，收音工作已经有了不少成效。
    在新闻总署发布建立广播收音网决定以后，四月二十六日，广播事业局又发出《为实施新闻总署关于建立广播收音网的决定给各人民台的通知》，具体的规定出各地人民广播台应根据当地情况拟定建立收音网计划。中央人民广播电台为了开展收音网工作，于五月初特别增设了“收音员联络科”开始举办收音员登记，截至九月初，已经登记的收音员共三百三十五人。另外，各地机关学校工厂有组织的收听中央台社会科学讲座，并与该台发生直接联系的，到九月七日止，共有四百七十一个单位，约八万六千人。现在该台正计划在各地工厂和学校中有计划的普遍的建立收音网，以便更有组织地收听有关工人和教育等节目，达到大家办“广播大学”、开展社会教育的目的。
    各地党政领导机关对于新闻总署建立广播收音网的决定也都十分重视。四个多月来，先后已经有东北人民政府文化部、中南军政委员会、华东军政委员会、西北军政委员会、西南军政委员会，和河北、察哈尔、平原、绥远、松江、黑龙江、吉林、辽东、辽西、热河、广东、湖南、浙江和苏南区等十四个省人民政府和人民行政公署；以及张家口、唐山、长春、鞍山、青岛等五个人民市政府和厦门市军管会、齐齐哈尔文教局先后发布了关于建立广播收音网的通令或指示。中国共产党各地领导机关，为了使各地党组织重视建立广播收音网的工作，并且在各地党的机关建立广播收音网，中共中央东北局、华东局、中南局、西北局、华南分局和山西、热河、湖北、浙江、福建、苏南、皖北、云南、和贵州等九省委和区党委以及张家口、唐山、南京、青岛、西安、成都、昆明等七个市的市委，也先后发布了关于建立收音网的指示和通知。
    各省建立广播收音网，一般地是先由各地领导机关指派或由各地人民广播电台征求收音员，然后经过一定时期的收音训练，再分发各地工作。四个多月中，收音员的数目迅速增加，据十五个省不完全的统计，共有专职和兼职收音员一千六百二十五人，其中华北五省即占五百一十一人，而河北一省，一百一十九个县三个市和八个镇，即有收音员二百三十八人。此外，人民解放军第四野战军也配备了专职收音员二百人，准备分配到四野各师、团负责收听工作。目前，华北区五省的收音员已经全部受过训练，早已开始工作；东北一部分省如吉林、热河各县的收音员也已经训练完毕；中南区鄂、豫、湘、粤、桂、赣六省的收音员，先后在七月、八月开始训练，九月月底，全区训练工作可以结束。华东部分地区如浙江省、山东省、福建省和苏北区也已开始训练收音员。皖北区的收音员已经于六月间集训完毕。整个华东区的收音员训练工作，准备在今年秋冬土改以前进行完毕。
    各县收音员的主要工作是抄收全国的、大行政区的和省的重要新闻和政策法令，送交当地党政领导机关，然后由领导机关选择印发各有关部门指导各种工作。察哈尔省人民政府在五月十三日发布的《关于使用广播电台传达贯彻政策法令的决定》中，就明确规定该省省府一切重要指示、决定、命令和通知，一律送交张家口人民台发出，与文件同等有效。此外，大部分收音员还负责组织干部和群众收听其他各种节目，如职工节目、妇女节目、讲座节目等。
    城市收音员的主要任务是组织各工厂、机关、团体、学校及各阶层人民收听各种广播。在这方面，许多大中城市的人民广播台都获得不少成绩。据京、津、沪、汉、济、无锡和鞍山等七个城市的统计，即有工厂厂内的有线广播台一百四十座。这些厂内广播台，每天除转播当地人民台的一定节目外，并广播各该厂内的新闻、通知等，成为城市收音网的有力据点。此外，大中城市的人民广播台以各种节目为中心，也组织了成千成万的听众。拿东北来说，东北人民台就已经组织了十万听众收听广播。松江省齐齐哈尔人民台一方面征求了二百名收音员，同时还在十五个县、两个市和一个矿区建立了收听组织，共包括一百四十个机关单位。沈阳市人民台七月份在一向漫无组织的城市妇女中组织了三千五百五十六个妇女收听小组，共五万零七百一十九人收听该台的“妇女时间”，而且在这些小组里还产生了许许多多积极的收音员。华东区上海人民台光是收听上海教联的演讲节目和市总学委主办的“社会发展史”广播课的有组织听众就有十三万左右；儿童节目组织了五百一十个学校，共五万六千多人收听。青岛人民台从六月下旬到七月底，一个多月光景就组织了一千五百多个儿童收听小组，参加收听的少年儿童有一万多人。
    四个多月来在全国范围内开始普遍建立广播收音网的工作，不但获得了上述的成绩，而且在已经建立收音网的地区，使人民广播电台对各项工作和广大人民的政治文化生活也起了显著的作用。
    由于广播收音网的普遍建立，证明无线电广播是传达各级政府法令、指示和通知、及时指导工作的最好工具之一。例如察哈尔省人民政府各部门的法令、指示和通知都能每天广播出去，经过收音员的抄收，迅速下达到各县甚至区，大大提高了行政效率。平原省湖西专区收听了该省省府的夏征通知，就立刻在单县城内七块黑板报上刊出，每天约有二百多人去看。又如当该区工会讨论纪念“五一”正愁没有材料进行宣传的时候，当天收听到了中央发布的纪念“五一”口号，立刻解决了困难。太原人民台今年三月播送了一封指示春耕检查的信，祁县收音员当时抄收了就送给负责同志，及时地保证了春耕检查工作。许多地方领导机关在收听广播直接对工作有了帮助以后，都纷纷写信给广播台取得联系。河北中共容城县委在给保定台的信里说，当他们正筹备三级选举布置工作时，由于抄收了村选宣传要点，立刻油印发到各村，对村选工作起了及时的指导作用。该省文安、静海、大城和临清等县，也在给广播台的信里提到，因为收听广播，提前完成了工作。
    通过广播收音网经常地可以把每天国内外发生的重要新闻迅速地传达到各县区，使各县区能及时的进行时事政策解说，也大大的推动了工作，提高了人民的政治觉悟。在福建永春县蓬壶有一位中学校长，他现在是中央人民广播电台的收音员。在一年前当地未解放时，他就经常把收听北平新华广播电台的消息，通过墙报在当地公布出来。永春、大田、德化三县附近许多村镇的人民就靠着这位收音员了解国内外大事。在湖北沙市，现在出版一种“广播消息”报，它的前身是“沙市日报”。这个报是八开两版的小型铅印日报，公开发行订阅。该报内容主要即是依靠收抄中央人民广播电台和中南人民广播电台的主要新闻。文字通俗简短，很受读者欢迎。同样性质的小型日报在湖北宜都县也有。此外依靠广播消息为来源而出版的油印小报，在各县就更多些。如察哈尔浑源县的“新闻广播”、右玉的“广播快报”、德化的“人民广播”等。在平原省有十八个县都办有这样的油印小报。在传播重要消息这一方面，各地收音员所联系的黑板报和屋顶广播起了很大的作用。如涿鹿县收到海南岛胜利消息后，曾组织了六十三块黑板报进行宣传，立即使胜利消息传遍村镇。平原省湖西专区单县一带，今年四、五月间特务造了许多谣言，当地领导机关就动员全城收音员收听海南岛和舟山群岛解放的消息在黑板报上刊出了并且印发了三千多份捷报，有力的打击了破坏分子的造谣。据六月份的统计，平原省已经有四十五个单位把收听的消息出了黑板报，十七个县送文化馆，十二个县进行了屋顶广播。再如最近的和平签名运动，通过广播收音网，也得到了不小的开展。例如在唐山回民中间原来没有很好的开展，但当唐山人民台邀请了回民代表白孑民先生做了一次讲演以后，第二天该市就有三千多回民签了名。锦州市夜校学员，组织收听了锦州人民台关于和平签名运动的广播，有五千多人立刻签了名。
    在社会教育方面，不论是帮助干部学习或提高广大人民的文化水平，组织收听广播，也表现了卓著的成绩。中央人民广播电台主办的社会科学讲座，不仅帮助许多机关、团体干部及热心学习的青年解决了没有教员和看不懂书的困难，而且成了广大听众学习的组织者，使各地干部能够按时收听，定期完成学习计划。有些人民广播电台，也多办有同类性质的节目，或者转播中央台节目，同样受到欢迎。保定台一方面转播中央台的社会科学讲座，一方面还请专人补充讲解一部分问题，对河北各县干部学习帮助更大。天津和滦县的听众来信说，这些问题都是他们争论不休的问题，要求以后多请人讲解。中央台及各地人民台举办的自然科学讲座同样拥有很多听众。当河北保定台播送“月蚀”时，仅淇县一县就有一百四十多个干部和群众收听，大家当天不睡觉等着看月蚀。长垣县的群众听了广播说：“解放军真能，什么也知道，现在才知道月蚀真不是黑煞神吃月亮了。”
    很显然的，收听广播已经逐渐和广大人民的生活密切联系起来。例如察哈尔人民台和该省卫生局，今年四月间主办了“防止察省鼠疫再起”的特别节目，全省各县都组织了医务卫生人员和学生收听。万全收听以后，各学校学生立即出发街头宣传，该县并很快恢复了防疫委员会的组织，机关干部和有组织的群众都进行了防疫注射。许多人民台的社会服务节目，专门解答听众的各种问题，普遍受到人民的欢迎。此外广播文艺节目在不少干部和群众的文艺娱乐生活中已成为不可缺少的一部分。干部和群众不仅要收听新闻和讲座，也喜欢收听各种文娱节目、各种地方戏和民歌，他们从收听广播中，学到许多歌曲，戏剧。
    在全国范围内建立广播收音网的工作还仅仅进行了四个多月，但就它的影响和作用来看，我们已经可以预见在不久的将来，全国收音网普遍建立之后，我国的人民广播事业将要出现一个崭新的局面。广播工作将要对我们整个国家工作效率、人民文化生活的提高发挥更大的作用。
