Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th: Shandong Province's early autumn crop harvest is nearing completion, and farmers in various areas are now actively engaged in autumn cultivation. Since the middle of August, when the province began harvesting early autumn crops, most areas have threshed and stored their crops, except for some areas in the east and north where harvesting is later. This year's general harvest has increased by 10% to 20% compared to last year, and in some individual areas, it has even doubled.

Simultaneous with the autumn harvest, many counties have put forward the slogan of "harvesting while cultivating" to strive for timely wheat sowing. Farmers in Mengshan and other counties began plowing the fields before the early autumn harvest was complete, and some areas have now cultivated more than half of their autumn fields. Farmers in Ganyu County had plowed the autumn land once over by mid-September, and areas with better conditions had completed two plowing rounds before the White Dew solar term.

During the autumn harvest, farmers in various parts of Shandong enthusiastically responded to the people's government's call to carry out seed selection activities, actively selecting superior varieties. For example, among the 8,436 farming households in the Second District of Guangrao, 5,614 households were engaged in seed selection. In the Qiaozhen District of Gaoqing, among the 158 farming households in six townships, more than 87,000 sorghum seeds were selected under the leadership and promotion of members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.

　　山东早秋收获近结束  正紧张秋耕准备种麦
    【新华社济南十八日电】山东省早秋作物收获已近结束，各地农民现正积极地进行秋耕。全省自八月中旬开始收割早秋作物后，到目前止，除去东部和北部收割较迟的地区尚有部分庄稼正在收打外，大部地区的早秋作物均已打晒入仓。今年一般收成比去年增加一成到两成以上，个别地区并增至一倍。
    与秋收同时，许多县提出“边收边耕”的口号，争取小麦及时播种。蒙山等县的农民在早秋尚未收完时，即纷纷开始犁田，有些地区现已耕完秋田一半以上。赣榆县的农民在九月中旬已将秋地普耕一遍，条件较好的地区在白露前即已耕完两遍。
    在秋收中，山东各地农民热烈地响应人民政府关于开展选种运动的号召，积极选择优良品种。如广饶二区八千四百三十六户农户中，进行选种的即达五千六百一十四户。高青臼镇区六个乡一百五十八户农户中，也在中国共产党党员和中国新民主主义青年团员的带头推动下，选得高粱良种八万七千多穗。
