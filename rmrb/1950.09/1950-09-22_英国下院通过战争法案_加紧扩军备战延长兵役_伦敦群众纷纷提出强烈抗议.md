Xinhua News Agency, 21st dispatch: The British Parliament's House of Commons, which reconvened on September 12th, after three consecutive days of discussion, passed on the 14th a three-year arms expansion and war preparation plan, costing 3.6 billion pounds, supporting the Labor government's policy under American orders. The plan was originally budgeted at 3.4 billion pounds, but was increased to the current amount after the announcement at the end of August of increased military pay to attract people to enlist, and on the 15th, a bill was passed to extend the term of military service from 18 months to two years. According to the British Information Service, Attlee told Parliament that after the enactment of the bill, within 1951, "if mobilization orders are issued, ten regular divisions and twenty territorial divisions can be formed after a certain period of time." However, in his speech, Attlee also expressed deep fears that this massive war preparation plan would "interrupt the progress made by the British economy after the war," "lower the people's living standards," and damage "economic strength and stability." Attlee continued to emphasize that the United States must pay for the arms expansion. He said: The extent to which the three-year arms expansion plan "can be implemented will depend on the amount of US aid," and claimed that negotiations are underway to request US aid to implement this plan.

The debate in Parliament indicated that the dissatisfaction of Labor's left-wing members with the government's war preparation policy is growing. Reuters and Agence France-Presse both mentioned in their reports that a "small group of pacifists" led by Harold Davies had appeared in Parliament. They were called "traitors" for opposing Attlee's war preparation bill.

According to TASS: During the House of Commons session, people from many parts of Britain sent delegations to London to protest the discussion of the war preparation bill to members of Parliament. The London Peace Committee submitted resolutions to members of Parliament demanding the abandonment of the arms expansion policy and the resumption of international negotiations on disarmament, the abolition of atomic weapons, and the maintenance of peace. On the 12th, the front of Parliament was filled with petitioning crowds, including housewives and workers from various industries. Representatives of the Mothers Against Conscription Committee held aloft banners that read: "Mothers of England, are our youths to be killed?" Woolley, a London printing worker, chaired the spontaneous meeting, urging the attendees to persevere and ensure that members of Parliament listened to the voices of the British people. He emphasized that if the pressure that has already begun today is maintained, it will have an effect. The attendees shouted slogans: "Don't fight for dollars!" "We need peace!"

While petitioning Parliament, the masses also went to the American Embassy to protest. Farrelly, the chief union delegate of De Havilland Aircraft Manufacturing Plant, said that the representatives were going to convey to the American Ambassador the indignation of the British people caused by the United States issuing orders to the British people through the British government. They wanted to remind him that they considered the American military occupation of British territory to be a bad move.

　　英国下院通过战争法案  加紧扩军备战延长兵役
    伦敦群众纷纷提出强烈抗议
    【新华社二十一日讯】英国议会下院自九月十二日复会，经三天连续讨论，已于十四日通过支持工党政府在美国命令下制订的耗资达三十六亿英镑的三年扩军备战计划。该计划原定耗资三十四亿英镑，由于八月底宣布为吸引人民服兵役而增加军饷后增至现数，并于十五日通过将兵役期限自十八个月延长至两年的法案。据英新处称：艾德礼向议会称：法案实施后，在一九五一年内，“如动员令下，经过若干时日可组成正规军十个师，地方军二十个师”。但是艾德礼在其演说中也对这一庞大的备战计划将“中断战后英国经济所获得的进展”，并“降低人民生活水准”，损害“经济的实力和稳定”表示深刻的恐惧。艾德礼继续强调扩军必须要美国出钱。他说：三年扩军计划“究能实行至何种程度，当取决于美援数量”，并声称要求美援以实现这一计划的谈判正在进行中。
    议会中的辩论表示工党左翼议员对政府备战政策的不满正在增涨。路透社和法新社在报道中都提到议会中已出现了以哈罗德·戴维斯为首的“一小群和平主义者”。他们因为反对艾德礼的备战法案而被称为“背叛”。
    据塔斯社报道：下院开会期间，英国许多地方的人民都派代表团到伦敦向议员们抗议讨论备战法案。伦敦和平委员会把决议案递交给议员们，要求放弃扩军政策，重开缩减军备废除原子武器维护和平的国际谈判。十二日议会门前站满了请愿行列，其中有家庭主妇们，各业工人们。征兵之母委员会代表们高举着旗帜，上面写着：“英格兰的母亲们，要我们的青年去被人杀戮吗？”伦敦印刷工人伍利在这次自发性的大会上担任主席，敦促会众继续坚持下去，一定要叫国会议员们倾听英国人民的呼声。他强调指出，如果把今天已经开始的这种压力继续保持下去，就会发生效果的。会众高呼口号：“不要为美元打仗！”“我们需要和平！”
    与向国会请愿同时，群众也曾赴美国大使馆提出抗议。德哈维兰飞机制造厂的主要工会委员法雷利说：代表们是要去向美国大使传达英国人民因为美国通过英国政府对英国人民发号施令而引起的愤慨。他们要提醒他：他们认为美军占领英国领土是不良的举动。
