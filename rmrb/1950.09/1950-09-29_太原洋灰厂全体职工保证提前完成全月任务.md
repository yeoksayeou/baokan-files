　　Taiyuan Cement Plant's Entire Workforce Guarantees Early Completion of Monthly Task
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The entire workforce of Taiyuan Cement Plant wrote to Chairman Mao, guaranteeing to complete the September production task ahead of schedule to welcome National Day and report on the achievements made. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:
    National Day is approaching, and under your wise leadership, the whole country has made great progress in the past year. Taking our factory as an example, it has also made great progress. After the launch of the production competition, the output and quality of our cement plant in July and August both exceeded the quotas and tasks. In July, our completed products exceeded the monthly production task by 32.9 percent. The standard quality residue is below 7 percent. In July, our product residue was reduced to 5.2 percent. In August, it exceeded the monthly production task by 10.59 percent. The quality residue was reduced to just over 5 percent. We will strive to complete the packaging of 57 tons of the original daily output of 200 tons packaging equipment. We are willing to report these good production news to you and are determined to welcome National Day with the early completion of the September task as a gift. Wishing you good health.
        Entire Workforce of Taiyuan Cement Plant
              September 26

　　太原洋灰厂全体职工保证提前完成全月任务
    【本报讯】太原洋灰厂全体职工上书毛主席，保证提前完成九月份生产任务，以迎接国庆，并报告已获得的成绩。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    国庆节快到了，一年来在你的英明领导下，全国上下都有很大的进步，拿我们厂子来说，也有很大的进步。开展生产竞赛后，七月份和八月份我们洋灰厂的产量和质量都超过了定额和任务。七月份我们完成的产品，超过了全月生产任务百分之三十二点九。定额质量残渣是百分之七以下，在七月份我们的产品残渣减到百分之五点二。八月份超过全月生产任务百分之十点五九。质量残渣减至百分之五强。并要就原有的日产量二百吨包装设备争取完成日产五十七吨的包装。我们愿意将这些生产好消息报告给你，并决心以提前完成九月份的任务为献礼来迎接国庆节。敬祝健康
        太原洋灰厂全体职工
              九月二十六日
