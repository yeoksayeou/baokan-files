　　Public Security Section Chief Violates Property Rights, Relevant Higher Authorities Actually Offer Protection

　　An incident occurred in Hongdong County where Zhao Xibian, the Public Security Bureau Section Chief, violated the property of a farmer. In the handling of this case, the Zhao City and Hongdong Judicial Sections distorted the facts to protect the cadre, and the Linfen Sub-Court also failed to handle it promptly and conscientiously. The facts are as follows:

　　Zhao Jinlin is Zhao Xibian's younger twin brother, who was given to the relatives of Zong Xingsheng in Gengbi Village as a son when he was young, and changed his name to Zong Jinlin. In 1945, he joined Yan Xishan's army. After Taiyuan was liberated last year, because the Zong family in Gengbi Village had all died and the property was sold out, Jinlin returned to his biological mother's home in Hanlue Village, registered his household with the village government, and officially resumed the Zhao surname.

　　On the thirteenth day of the tenth lunar month last year, Zhao Jinlin, on his mother's orders, drove a donkey to the coal mine to carry coal. Taking the opportunity, he drove the donkey to the Zhao City fair and sold it to Li Liuwa for five shi and four dou of wheat. Then he went to Lingstone to sell peanuts for a living. After Zhao Xibian learned of this, he went to Lingstone with weapons on the second day of the twelfth lunar month, and through personal connections with the local public security team, he tied up his brother Jinlin, searched him and took away 156,000 yuan in Renminbi. After repaying 73,000 yuan in debts, he pocketed the rest (according to Jinlin, he searched and took away 145,000 yuan, and repaid 50,000 yuan in debts). On the third day, the Zhao brothers went to Zhao City together. On the way, Zhao Xibian said to Zhao Jinlin: After arriving at the Public Security Bureau, don't reveal that we are brothers. Just admit that you are working as a temporary worker in Hanlue Village and someone hired you to carry coal, and you were deceived into selling the donkey. After we get the donkey back from Li Liuwa, we are still brothers.

　　Upon arriving at the Zhao City Public Security Bureau, Zhao Xibian told the fabricated situation to the Public Security Captain Jiao Changmao (whom he knew from the army and had a personal relationship with). After listening, Jiao arrested Zhao Jinlin and sent three public security officers with weapons to Li Liuwa's home overnight. Without asking any questions, they pulled the donkey away. Li Liuwa's family was shocked and confused. The father and son followed to the Public Security Bureau to request a resolution, but the response was "We'll talk about it tomorrow."

　　The next day, Jiao Changmao introduced Zhao Xibian's situation to the interrogation section chief, Duan Qinghua. During the interrogation, Duan insisted that Li Liuwa had bought a stolen donkey at a bargain price. Li Baobao (Li Liuwa's son) could not argue and had to endure it at the time. After discussion by the bureau affairs meeting, it was still determined that Zhao Xibian was the rightful owner and Zhao Jinlin was the swindler. Section Chief Duan personally sent the original case to the Zhao City Judicial Section for handling.

　　Guo Longwang, a member of the Zhao City Judicial Section, without investigation or research, lightly believed the Public Security Bureau's materials and hastily handed the donkey over to Zhao Xibian and detained Zhao Jinlin.

　　Li Liuwa was not convinced and went to the CCP Zhao City County Committee and the Tax Bureau, but the reply was: the research had not yielded results. Li went home and cried for two days. Later, he went to Gengbi to investigate and found out that Zhao Xibian and Zhao Jinlin were brothers, not hired workers. He then requested the Zhao City Judicial Section to re-handle the case. At this time, Guo Longwang also realized that Zhao Xibian had deceived the government and made them misjudge the case. He then admitted his mistake to Li Baobao in person and summoned Zhao Xibian to Hongdong County several times (also through telephone), but Zhao refused to appear on the grounds of excuses. The Zhao City Judicial Section, unable to handle the case because Zhao Xibian repeatedly failed to appear, transferred the original case to the Hongdong County Government on February 21st of this year, and told Hongdong County that the Zhao brothers colluded to deceive the government.

　　However, the Hongdong County Judicial Section did not analyze or study the case, but blindly protected the cadre, perfunctorily and procrastinated, still treating Zhao Jinlin as the hired worker Zong Jinlin, and stubbornly demanded the price of the donkey from him, attempting to close the case. Despite Li Liuwa's repeated urging more than ten times, the county's judicial section turned a blind eye to Li's grievances and suffering, and only verbally sentenced Zhao Jinlin to three months in prison and ordered him to return the price of the donkey, one shi and three dou of corn (equivalent to six dou and five sheng of wheat), and one shi of wheat (that is, using the money Zhao Xibian obtained from Zhao Jinlin to compensate Li Liuwa, but in fact Zhao did not pay Li). The fact that Zhao Xibian deceived the government and extorted Li Liuwa and his son was not mentioned at all.

　　Li Liuwa refused to accept the original judgment and appealed to the Linfen Sub-Court on April 7th. The court immediately asked Hongdong County for the judgment. However, the court only sent a copy of the April judgment several months later, which stated: "Zhao Xibian and Jinlin are not brothers, and Li Liuwa's request to return the price of the donkey is inappropriate." At the same time, the "section chief" position of Zhao was changed to "police officer" in an attempt to cover up. After the Linfen Sub-Court accepted the case, it summoned Zhao Xibian three times. Zhao initially refused to appear, and then the Hongdong Public Security Bureau sent letters several times stating. The letter on May 12 stated: "I (referring to Zhao Xibian) am very busy with work and have no time to come for an interview"; the letter on May 22 stated: "Our bureau's cadres are in meetings and have no time to participate". As a result, the case was delayed for more than a month (although Li Baobao urged the Linfen Court Sub-Court five times, it was still not resolved). On May 26, Li Baobao said to Wu Zhihui, the Deputy President of the Sub-Court: "I haven't eaten for two days, I really can't afford this lawsuit." Wu replied: "The court can't provide you with food, who told you to file a lawsuit? Wait two more days!" Li Baobao had no other choice and walked out of the court crying. At this time, he happened to meet Wang Shiyuan and Wang Chengyu, reporters from the Shanxi Daily, and told them about his grievances. The reporters immediately visited Deputy President Wu Zhihui to understand the details of the case. The Shanxi Daily revealed the case and Li Baobao's conversation with the newspaper's reporters on June 5. The Linfen Sub-Court then issued a warrant for Zhao Xibian. Zhao had no choice but to surrender and confessed to the fact that he had used his power to encroach on farmers' property. The Sub-Court then ruled on the 28th: The defendant Zhao Xibian illegally occupied the people's donkey and was sentenced to six months in prison; Zhao Jinlin sold his own donkey and did not steal it, and revoked the three-month imprisonment imposed by Hongdong County and declared him innocent; The donkey should be reclaimed by Li Liuwa. The cost of food, lodging and travel expenses incurred by Li Liuwa and others in the litigation shall be compensated by Zhao Xibian with six dou and five sheng of wheat and 30,000 yuan in Renminbi.

　　The Shanxi Provincial People's Court reviewed the judgment of the Linfen Sub-Court and changed the sentence of Zhao Xibian to two and a half years in prison, and the accomplice Zhao Jinlin to six months in prison. The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government also instructed the Shanxi People's Court to submit all materials to the Provincial Government for administrative punishment of the cadres who have mishandled the trial and violated their duties, based on the seriousness of the circumstances, after reviewing the revised judgment of the Shanxi People's Court.

### 公安股长侵犯产权有关上级竟予包庇

　　公安股长侵犯产权有关上级竟予包庇
    洪洞县发生了一件公安局股长赵希汴侵犯农民财产的事件。而在这一案件的处理上，赵城、洪洞司法科竟歪曲事实，袒护干部；临汾分院也未及时认真处理。事实经过如下：
    赵金林是赵希汴的二胞弟，自幼给了梗壁村的亲戚宗兴胜为儿，改叫宗金林。一九四五年到阎顽军队里当兵。去年太原解放后，因梗壁村宗姓全家死亡，产业卖尽，金林才回到韩略村生母家里，向村政府报了户口，正式恢复赵姓。
    去年阴历十月十三日，赵金林奉母之命，赶着一头母驴前往煤窑驮炭，乘机将毛驴赶到赵城会集上，以五石四斗麦价，卖给了李六娃，于是到灵石摆花生摊为生。赵希汴知道此事后，即于十二月初二携带武器前往灵石，通过该地公安队私人关系，将其弟金林捆绑起来，搜去人民币十五万六千元，除代还外债七万三千元之外，其余装入私囊（据金林说，搜去十四万五千元，代还债五万元。）初三日赵家兄弟二人同往赵城，在途中赵希汴对赵金林说：到公安局后，不要暴露咱是弟兄，你只承认在韩略村打短工，别人雇你驮炭，你受骗把驴出卖了。等把驴从李六娃那里弄回来后，咱俩还是亲兄弟。
    到了赵城公安局，赵希汴把虚构的情况告诉公安队长焦长茂（过去在部队里认识的，有私人感情）。焦听罢便把赵金林押起来，并派了三个公安队员携带武器星夜到了李六娃家，不问青红皂白拉了驴就走。李六娃全家惊惶失措，不明究竟。父子二人跟到公安局要求解决，而回答却是“明天再说。”
    第二天，焦长茂将赵希汴所说的情况，向审讯股长段清华作了介绍。段在审问时硬说李六娃贪便宜买了小偷的毛驴。李保宝（李六娃的儿子）无法分辩，当时只好忍受着。后经该局局务会议研究结果，仍认定赵希汴是失主，赵金林是骗子。并由段股长亲自把原案送到赵城司法科处理。
    赵城司法科科员郭隆旺未经调查研究，就轻信公安局的材料，草率地把驴交赵希汴拉走，将赵金林扣起来。
    李六娃不服，去找中共赵城县委会和税务局，但得到的回答是：研究未获结果。李回家哭了两天，后来自己到梗壁去调查，才知道赵希汴与赵金林是兄弟关系，并不是雇工。他就向赵城司法科要求重作处理。这时郭隆旺也知道赵希汴骗了政府，使他们把案判反了，乃当面向李保宝承认错误，并数次向洪洞县传唤赵希汴（又经电话催传），而赵竟借故不到案。赵城司法科以赵希汴屡传不到无法处理，即于今年二月二十一日将原案移送洪洞县政府，同时把赵家弟兄串通欺骗政府事实，告诉了洪洞县。
    可是，洪洞县司法科对该案不加分析研究，一味包庇干部，敷衍因循，仍把赵金林当雇工宗金林看待，硬向其追索驴价，企图了案。虽经李六娃十余次的催促，而该县司法科对李所受冤屈和痛苦却熟视无睹，仅仅口头判处赵金林徒刑三个月，并叫退还驴价玉茭一石三斗（折合麦子六斗五升）、麦子一石（即以赵希汴从赵金林身上搜得之款偿还李六娃，但事实上赵未付给李），对赵希汴欺骗政府讹诈李六娃父子一事却一字未提。
    李六娃不服原判，于四月七日上诉临汾分院。该院即向洪洞县要判决书。但该院在数月后始送去四月份的判决书一份，上面写着：“赵希汴、金林不是兄弟关系，李六娃要求退回驴价理由欠妥。”同时竟把赵“股长”职务改写为“警士”，曲予包庇。临汾分院受理后，曾先后传讯三次，赵希汴初则抗不到庭，而后洪洞公安局竟数次来信声明。五月十二日的信上说：“本人（指赵希汴）工作甚忙，无隙前去面谈”；二十二日的信上说：“本局干部因开会无隙前去参加”。以致该案拖延了一个多月（虽经李保宝向临汾法院分院连催五次，仍得不到解决）。五月二十六日，李保宝对分院副院长武志慧说：“我两天还没吃饭，这官司我实在打不起了。”武却答道：“法院不能管你饭吃，谁叫你打官司来？你再等两天吧！”李保宝无法可想，哭着走出了法院。这时他恰巧碰上了山西日报的记者王士元、王丞玉，把受屈情况告诉了他们。记者们当即走访武志慧副院长，了解了该案始末。山西日报于六月五日将该案经过和李保宝和该报记者的谈话一并揭露。临汾分院至此始行票拘赵希汴。赵也就不得不前来投案，对其仗势侵占农民财产的事实供认不讳。分院乃于二十八日判决：被告赵希汴非法侵占人民毛驴，判处徒刑六个月；赵金林出卖自己毛驴，并非偷盗，又撤销洪洞县判处的徒刑三个月，宣告无罪释放；毛驴则由李六娃领回。李六娃等涉讼所需食宿路费，由赵希汴赔偿小麦六斗五升，人民币三万元。
    山西省人民法院对临汾分院的判决作了复核，改判赵希汴徒刑二年半，从犯赵金林处徒刑六个月。中央人民政府最高法院亦于审核山西人民法院的改判后，指示该院对审理失当及违法失职的干部，将依据全部材料提请省府分别按情节轻重予以行政处分。
