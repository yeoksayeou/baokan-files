Xinhua News Agency, Antung, September 26th: Following the bombing of Antung City by aircraft of the American invading forces in Korea on the evening of the 22nd, responsible persons from our local military and government organs immediately went to the scene of the incident to conduct a survey. Zhang Keyu, Director of the Antung City Public Security Bureau and concurrently commander of the city's air defense, immediately led personnel to the scene for inspection after the city was bombed. Zhang Qilong, Secretary of the Liaodong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhou Yong, Chief of Staff of the Liaodong Military Region, also personally went to provide instructions for the survey. An investigation team consisting of nearly a hundred cadres from military and government organs began work on the morning of the 23rd. The bombed locations were measured in detail and photographed, and the damaged houses, doors, and windows in the vicinity were checked household by household. The entire survey and investigation work took eight hours. According to detailed investigation results, in addition to two Chinese compatriots being injured and one child suffering a concussion from the violent shock, a total of 1,181 households near the scene of the incident suffered damage. 969 and a half houses had their roof tiles and glass shattered. Nearby residents' vegetable gardens totaling 5.7 mu were destroyed. Also, one horse (previously mistaken for multiple horses) was injured. Investigation team members, after carefully studying the collected bomb fragments, determined that the bombs were indeed American-made. For example, the markings on the shrapnel: "(FUZE)·(M161)·(AOP)--(30)--(15)--(45)". Among them, "(FUZE)" is a special term for American-made bomb fuzes; "(M161)" is a specific code for the American-made bomb style; "(AOP)--(30)--(15)--(45)" is the brand name of the American bomb fuze manufacturer. Furthermore, based on the explosion characteristics of the bombs dropped by American aircraft this time, these bombs are explosive bombs of 200 pounds or more, containing high-grade explosives with extremely strong explosive power. The bomb steel is "steel milled steel," which, when the steel bomb explodes, shatters into pieces flying in all directions with serrated and pointed cross-sections, mainly used to kill people and destroy buildings.

　　美机轰炸安东事件中
    千余户居民遭受损害
    【新华社安东二十六日电】美国侵略朝鲜军队的飞机于二十二日晚轰炸安东市后，我当地军政机关负责人立即前往出事地点进行勘查。安东市人民政府公安局长兼该市防空司令张克宇在该市被轰炸后立即率员赴出事地点视察。中共辽东省委会书记张启龙和辽东军区参谋长周勇等亦亲往指示勘查事宜。由军政机关干部近百人组成之调查组已自二十三日晨起展开工作，被炸地点均经详细测量并摄成照片，附近被震坏之房屋、门窗亦均逐户进行点查。全部勘察调查工作，前后历八小时。据详细调查结果，除我国同胞有两人被炸伤，一儿童受剧烈震动一度晕厥外，出事地点附近受损害的居民共一千一百八十一户，计有九百六十九间半房屋的屋瓦和玻璃震坏；附近居民菜园被炸毁共五亩七分；另有马一头（前误为多头）被炸伤。调查组人员经过对所收集之炸弹碎片进行仔细研究，断定所投炸弹确属美国制造。如弹片上的“（ＦＵＺＥ）·（Ｍ１６１）·（ＡＯＰ）——（３０）——（１５）——（４５）”的字样。其中“（ＦＵＺＥ）”是美制炸弹信管之专称；“（Ｍ１６１）”是美造炸弹式样之专用代号；“（ＡＯＰ）——（３０）——（１５）——（４５）”是美国炸弹信管制造厂出品的牌号。又从此次美机所投炸弹爆炸情形分析，这些炸弹乃系二百磅以上之爆炸弹，内装高级炸药，爆炸力极强。炸弹钢质系“钢性铣”，此种钢质炸弹在爆炸后粉碎四飞之弹片，断面呈锯齿斜尖形状，主要用于杀伤人体和破坏建筑物。
