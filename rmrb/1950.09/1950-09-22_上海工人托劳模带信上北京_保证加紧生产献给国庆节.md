　　Shanghai Workers Entrust Labor Model to Bring Letters to Beijing
    Guarantee Increased Production to Dedicate to National Day
    [This newspaper reports] According to Shanghai Liberation Daily news: More than 1,400 workers, foremen, and engineers from the Shanghai Electric Power Company's power plant gathered in front of the plant on the 16th to bid farewell to their representative – Comrade Zhang Shibao, a nationally recognized labor model elected from the plant – as he departed for Beijing. Amidst the sounds of military music "We Workers Have Strength" and firecrackers, everyone rushed to shake hands with Zhang Shibao and asked him to send their regards to Chairman Mao on their behalf. To express their respect for their leader Chairman Mao, the entire workforce of the plant, after discussion, decided to entrust him with two gifts: one was a model of the entire plant after being bombed on February 6th; and the other was a banner with the six characters "Salute to Chairman Mao" composed of signatures of all the workers. The banner also included a letter reporting to Chairman Mao their determination to complete production tasks ahead of schedule. The letter stated: "Now, we are guaranteeing to complete the following before National Day with unparalleled production enthusiasm: 1. Repairing the No. 8 generator (destroyed by enemy aircraft); 2. Overhauling the No. 30 boiler (ahead of schedule by 35 days); 3. Overhauling the No. 18 boiler (ahead of schedule by 14 days); as well as minor repairs to the No. 29 boiler, overhauling one 450-horsepower motor, repairing the No. 4 coal mill, and one air preheater for the No. 35 boiler, etc., as a congratulatory gift to celebrate the first anniversary of the founding of the new China, in response to your call to strive for a fundamental improvement in the nation's financial and economic situation!"
    Nineteen drilling workers from the Jiangnan Shipyard, taking advantage of the opportunity of Jin Longshan, the shipyard's elected national labor model representative, going to Beijing, bought a diary and entrusted him to give it to Chairman Mao. They also attached a letter, which began by sending their regards to the respected Chairman Mao, and continued: "Before, fifteen of us nineteen people were illiterate and had to ask others how to write our names. Now, Chairman Mao, do you think our signatures look alright? We learned this in the after-work literacy classes in the factory after liberation. If it weren't for your leadership, would our hands, calloused from holding hammers, ever be able to hold pens?…" The letter also stated that they were working happily and actively, and made the following guarantees: complete tasks, obey leadership, never complain no matter how much work there is, voluntarily help others, protect the factory like protecting our own home, take the lead in work, unite everyone, not leave early, not be late, and not slack off, etc.
    Workers from the Shanghai Transportation Company also entrusted Zhang Deqing, the company's labor model representative, to take a letter to pay their respects to Chairman Mao.

　　上海工人托劳模带信上北京
    保证加紧生产献给国庆节
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报消息：上海电力公司发电厂一千四百多工友及领班、工程师等于十六日齐集该厂门前欢送自己的代表——该厂当选的全国劳模代表张世宝工友赴京。在“咱们工人有力量”军乐声及鞭炮声中大家争着和张世宝握手告别，并托他代向毛主席问候。该厂全体工友为表示对自己的领袖毛主席的敬意，经大家讨论，决定托他带去两件礼物：一个是二月六日轰炸后的全厂被炸模型；一个是全体工友用签名拼成的“向毛主席致敬”六个字的锦旗，锦旗上还写着一封信，向毛主席报告他们决心提前完成生产任务，信中写着：“现在，我们正以无比的生产热情，保证在开国纪念日以前完成：一、修复八号发电机（遭匪机炸毁的）；二、大修三十号锅炉（可超额三十五天）；三、大修十八号锅炉（可超额十四天）；以及小修二十九号锅炉、检修四百五十匹马达一只、检修四号磨煤机、三十五号锅炉空气预热器一具等工作，作为庆祝新中国诞生一周年的贺礼，以响应您的号召，为争取国家财政经济状况基本好转而奋斗！”
    江南造船所的十九位钻眼工友，趁该所当选全国劳模代表金龙山到北京去的机会，买了本日记簿，托他送给毛主席，同时还附写了一封信，信的内容开始就向敬爱的毛主席问安，接着说：“以前我们十九个人，有十五个人不识字，写自己的名字还要请教别人，现在，毛主席，你看我们的签名还像样吧！这是解放后我们厂里上业余文化课学会的，要不是你领导我们，我们长满老茧拿惯榔头的手，还会拿笔杆子吗？………………”信中并说，他们工作很愉快也很积极，并提出保证：完成任务服从领导，不管工作多少也不叫苦，自动帮助别人，保护工厂像保护自己的家，在工作上起带头作用，团结大家，不早退，不迟到，不磨洋工等。
    上海交通公司工友，也托该公司劳模代表张德庆带了一封信，向毛主席致敬。
