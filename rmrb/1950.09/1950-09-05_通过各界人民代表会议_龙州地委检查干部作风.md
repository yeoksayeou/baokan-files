　　Through People's Representatives Conferences from All Circles
    Longzhou Prefectural Committee of the CCP Inspects Cadre Style
    [Our Newspaper] The Longzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Guangxi inspected its work and cadre style through people's representatives conferences from all circles. In the rectification instructions issued in mid-July, the Longzhou Prefectural Committee emphasized that this rectification should focus on inspecting and summarizing the work of suppressing bandits, opposing local bullies, reducing rent, collecting grain in rural areas, and urban industry, commerce, and taxation in the past six months. After the rectification began at the end of July, in addition to general document study and work inspection, symposiums of representatives from all circles were held to solicit opinions and criticisms from representatives from all circles on financial and economic work, military-civilian relations, and other issues. The same was true in all counties. At the People's Representatives Conference in Longjin County, representatives raised opinions about the coercive command style in industry and commerce taxation. At the People's Representatives Conference in Shangjin County, criticisms were made of the phenomena of violating policies and disciplines in the work of suppressing bandits. In addition, the Prefectural Committee also organized rural work inspection teams to conduct key inspections in Longjin County. (Gao Ping)

    龙州地委检查干部作风
    【本报讯】中共广西龙州地委通过各界人民代表会检查工作，检查干部作风。龙州地委在七月中旬发出的整风指示中，着重指出此次整风中要检查总结半年来农村剿匪，反霸，减租，征粮和城市工商、税收工作。七月底整风开始后，除一般学习文件检查工作外，并召开各界代表座谈会，征求各界代表对于财经工作，军民关系及其他问题的意见和批评。各县也是如此。龙津县各界人民代表会上，各代表对工商税收中的强迫命令作风提出了意见。上金县各界人民代表会，对剿匪工作中违反政策违反纪律的现象作了批评。此外，地委并组织农村工作巡视组，到龙津县进行重点检查工作。（高平）
