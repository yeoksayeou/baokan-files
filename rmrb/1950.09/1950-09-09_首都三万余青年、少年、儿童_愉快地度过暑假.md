　　Over 30,000 Youths, Young People, and Children in the Capital
    Enjoyed a Happy Summer Vacation
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the guidance of the Beijing Youth Summer Life Committee and with the enthusiastic help of school administrations and relevant parties, over 30,000 young students and children in the capital enjoyed a happy summer vacation.
    Over four thousand students joined swimming teams and frequently went to the Summer Palace to swim. Various schools universally organized different sports teams, with over two thousand students from sixty schools participating in district-level sports competitions. More than four hundred and eighty students participating in the Xinghai Chorus and over six hundred and sixty students studying in the five departments of literature, drama, music, fine arts, and dance at the amateur art school became active members in carrying out cultural and recreational activities in their respective schools. Through the films and various lectures offered by the five district youth academies in Beijing, as well as the learning activities organized by various school art organizations, students held various discussions and chats, gaining intellectual and cultural enrichment. Various study groups voluntarily organized by the students, under the guidance of teachers, carried out experiments, specimen collection, dissection, and visits to factories and farms, gaining considerable scientific knowledge. Over a thousand students, divided into two groups, participated in the seaside summer camp in Qinhuangdao, holding sports meets and evening parties, and also held get-togethers with soldiers and workers.
    In these summer activities, the Youth League played an active role in promoting them. Many students who did not like activities participated with great interest due to the diversity of summer activities. This strengthened the connection between the Youth League and the masses.
    The young children of Beijing also spent a happy summer vacation in the sixteen summer children's playgrounds throughout the city. They strengthened their bodies and learned many basic scientific knowledge and skills. They practiced small-scale craft experiments, sewing, and making models of airplanes and ships, practiced sketching, painting, and sculpture, and collected many specimens. With the help of teachers, many children often read books in reading rooms and book clubs. Various activities such as sports teams, waist drum performances, singing, and drama also attracted many children to participate. Over three thousand six hundred children, divided into ten groups, participated in the children's camping held at the Cultural Palace of the Working People. During a day of camping, the children engaged in setting up camp gates, playing group games, and listening to stories of heroic models at the campfire party, demonstrating the children's spirit of unity and friendship.
