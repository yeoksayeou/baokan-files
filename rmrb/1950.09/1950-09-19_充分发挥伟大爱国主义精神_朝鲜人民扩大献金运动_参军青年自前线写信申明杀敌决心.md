The young people of Pyongyang who enthusiastically joined the army after the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea have recently sent many letters from the front to the North Korean Democratic Youth League, which are filled with the determination to resolutely eliminate the enemy and defend the motherland.

The Pyongyang newspapers published these letters on the 14th. Choi Jung-bok, a first-year student in the Physics Department of Pyongyang Normal University, has become a platoon leader in a certain unit of the People's Army on the Daegu front due to his brave fighting. His letter said: "In the past month, I have become a strong soldier. During the southward advance, we personally witnessed the atrocities of the American invading troops and the remnants of the Lee Seung-man bandit army slaughtering the outstanding patriots of our motherland, which strengthened our hatred for the enemy. Now, we are attacking the enemy everywhere, vowing to fight bravely to completely eliminate the enemy." Min Won-sik, a third-year student at Pyongyang Normal School, was credited in the battle to liberate Daejeon and was promoted to platoon leader of an automatic rifle unit. He wrote in his letter: "I have received good training in actual combat life. In the liberated cities and villages, our compatriots, brothers, and sisters were moved to tears by our gratitude, enthusiastically welcomed us, and gave us full support, which made me feel how important our combat mission is. In order to completely eliminate the enemy, I am determined to dedicate my last drop of blood."
