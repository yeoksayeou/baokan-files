　　Humble Attitude, Spirit of Diligent Learning
    Noble Qualities of Combat Hero Representatives
    By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo
    On the second day of the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference, the keynote speeches of the heroes began. With a very humble attitude, the heroes exchanged and diligently learned from each other's heroic deeds and experiences. These noble qualities of revolutionary heroism mark the promising future of the heroes and their heroic motherland.
    The heroes humbly attributed their achievements and honors to the leader of the people and to all the working people. Zhang Ming, Deputy Regimental Commander of a certain unit of the Third Field Army and commander of the Luoyang Battalion, said in his report at the conference on his heroic deeds: "After listening to the reports of the heroes, I feel very ashamed because although I have been nurtured by the Party and the people for these years, my contribution to the people is still very small. I can only study hard in the future and do more for the Party and the people." Zhang Yingcai, who was awarded the titles of "Iron Ninth Company," "Steel Zhang Yingcai Battalion," and "Steel Battalion Commander," said after reporting his deeds: "These achievements are not my personal achievements, but are the result of the correct leadership of the Party and the efforts of all the officers and soldiers of the battalion. Therefore, the glory should belong to the Party and to all the officers and soldiers." Liu Kuiji, a combat hero of the Third Field Army, said: "Our cause is so great that I feel I am too small. Without the education of the Party and Chairman Mao, and without the help of comrades, I would not have been able to do even these few small things. Honor should first belong to the Party and Chairman Mao, and to all the comrades who fought with us." Ma Wanxin, a combat hero of the First Field Army, neatly wrote in his diary: "Do not be proud of our victory, learn humbly, and improve ourselves." At the conference, every combat hero representative listened attentively to the keynote speeches. In the quiet venue, many heroes were taking careful notes. The hero representatives who could not take notes were even more eagerly listening to the speakers' combat experience, wanting to enrich themselves as much as possible. Fan Baoku, a combat hero representative from the North China Military Region, because of his low level of education, did not take complete notes, but he deeply remembered the main experience of each hero in his heart.
    During the break, many heroes still enthusiastically exchanged experiences. Tai Xide, a young Mongolian combat hero, and Lu Junsheng, a veteran combat hero from the War of Resistance Against Japan, discussed and gestured about the experience of using horsepower when charging on horseback and the methods of bayonet fighting. They also left each other's mailing addresses in their commemorative albums, preparing to communicate and exchange experiences at any time after returning. The militia heroes were also discussing each hero's report, trying to absorb new experiences from it.
    The hero representatives all expressed that they would bring all their experience back to the troops where they are located, promote learning throughout the troops, better improve the ideology and skills of all officers and soldiers, and strive to build a strong, modern national defense army.

　　谦逊的态度，虚心学习的精神
    战斗英雄代表们的高贵品质
    本报记者  朱波
    在全国战斗英雄代表会议第二日大会上，英雄们的典型发言开始了。英雄们怀着非常谦逊的态度，相互交流和虚心学习英勇的事迹与经验。这种革命英雄主义的高贵品质，标志着英雄们和英雄们的祖国伟大胜利的前途。
    英雄们谦逊地把自己的功绩和荣誉，归功于人民的领袖，归功于全体劳动人民。第三野战军某部副团长、洛阳营的指挥员张明，在大会上报告自己的英雄事迹时说：“听了各位英雄的报告后，自己感到很惭愧，因为自己虽然受党和人民培育了这些年，但是对人民的贡献还很少，只有今后努力学习，为党为人民多做一些事情。”荣膺“铁的九连”、“如钢似铁张英才营”、“钢铁营长”等称号的张英才，报告了自己的事迹后说：“这些功劳不是我个人的，是党领导的正确，是全营指战员的努力而得来的。因此，光荣应该属于党，属于全体指战员。”三野战斗英雄刘奎基说：“我们的事业这么大，我感到自己太渺小了。如果没有党和毛主席的教育，没有同志们对我的帮助，就连这几件小事我也是做不成的。荣誉应该首先属于党和毛主席，属于我们一同战斗的全体同志。”第一野战军战斗英雄马万新，在他的日记本子上，很整齐地写着“不要因为我们的胜利而骄傲，虚心地学习，提高自己。”大会上，每一个战斗英雄代表，都在聚精会神地听取典型发言。静静的会场里，很多英雄都在仔细地作笔记。不会记笔记的英雄代表，更是如饥如渴的聆听发言者的战斗经验，想多多来丰富自己。华北军区战斗英雄代表樊宝库，因为文化程度低，笔记记的不完全，但是，他对每个英雄的主要经验，都深刻地记在心里。
    很多英雄在休息的时间，还是很热烈地互相交流经验。蒙族青年战斗英雄邰喜德和抗日战争中老战斗英雄吕俊生，比划着讨论乘马冲锋时使用马力的经验，和拚刺刀的方法。他俩并在各人的记念册上，留下了对方通信地址，准备回去以后随时通信交流经验。民兵英雄们也在讨论着每个英雄的报告，设法从中吸收新的经验。
    英雄代表们都这样表示：要把全部经验带到自己所在的部队里去，推动整个部队进行学习，更好地提高全体指战员的思想和技术，为建设强大的现代化的国防军而努力。
