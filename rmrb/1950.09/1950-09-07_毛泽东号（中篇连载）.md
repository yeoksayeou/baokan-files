　　Nineteen, Think Again

　　On the way, he was thinking about how to talk to the Section Chief when he saw him.

　　However, as soon as he heard the sounds of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" and other locomotives, he couldn't concentrate on thinking about it anymore. The locomotives were puffing out plumes of black and white smoke, busy with shunting. For more than thirty years, he had been with them day and night. Now that he was getting off the locomotive, where would he be transferred to? He felt even more uncomfortable. He not only couldn't bear to part with the "Mao Zedong Locomotive," but he also felt that he couldn't leave any of the locomotives. Leaving the locomotives, life seemed to have no meaning at all. At this moment, he suddenly realized that the locomotives were much more lovable and important than his family, his wife, and his children. As for the rice, it was nothing to be concerned about.

　　Thinking of this, he intended to turn back, but when he looked up, he saw the Section Chief's office right in front of him. He hesitated for a long time, finally gritted his teeth, and decided to go in and find Representative Zhang first.

　　Representative Zhang invited the old hero to sit down and asked him what was the matter.

　　The old hero said straightforwardly:

　　"I request to leave the locomotive, my ability is not enough..." As he spoke, tears unexpectedly streamed down his face.

　　Representative Zhang also became nervous. Recently, he had learned about the situation of the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" and was studying solutions. They had not paid enough attention to this issue and had not helped to deal with it in a timely manner. The leadership had to take responsibility. He first made this self-criticism to the old hero. Then he said:

　　"Leaving the locomotive is not the solution. Problems should be solved."

　　The old hero said:

　　"I haven't led well, you can't blame the section, I made a mistake!..." After Representative Zhang made a self-criticism first, he further realized that the rice problem was his fault.

　　Representative Zhang comforted him for a while, saying that buying things privately was nothing before liberation. The Disciplinary Team's handling also had shortcomings, such as a lack of explanation and being somewhat mechanical. He also said that in order to lead the work well, it was important to unite everyone, and this aspect should be improved in the future.

　　Li Yong said:

　　"Isn't it said that there will be a major adjustment of the locomotive personnel? Transferring me to another locomotive would solve all the problems."

　　Representative Zhang said:

　　"If the leadership method is not improved, there will be problems on any locomotive. As long as it is improved, you can still do well on the 'Mao Zedong Locomotive'. Think about it again."

　　When Li Yong came out, he still had no confidence.

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）

    十九、再想一想
    一路上，他想着见了段长怎么说。
    可是，一听见“毛泽东号”和别的机车的叫声，他就无心再细想。机车喷吐着一股股的黑烟白烟，忙着调度。三十多年来他净是和它们日夜相处的呀，这次下车知道会调到哪里去？他觉得更难受了。他不仅舍不得“毛泽东号”，他觉得连哪一台机车也离不开。离开了机车，活着似乎就一点意思也没有。这时刻，他突然发现原来机车比家庭、比老伴、孩子还可爱得多，重要得多，大米不大米，更不是什么了不起的事情了。
    想到这里，他打算返回去；但一抬头，面前就是段长办公室。他犹豫了半天，终于咬了咬牙，决定先进去找张代表。
    张代表请老英雄坐下，问他有什么事？
    老英雄直截了当地说：
    “我请求下车，能力不够……”说着，想不到眼泪就流了出来。
    张代表也紧张起来。最近他已经知道了“毛泽东号”的情形，正在研究解决办法。他们对这问题注意得不够，没有及时帮助处理，领导上要负责任，他把这个先对老英雄作了检讨。然后他说：
    “下车不是办法，有问题应想法解决。”
    老英雄说：
    “我领导得不好，不能怪段上，我有错误！……”张代表先一检讨，他进一步觉悟到大米问题是自己不好。
    张代表又安慰了他一番，说私买东西在解放以前本来算不了什么，纠察队处理得也有缺点，比如缺乏解释，机械了一些。又说到要把工作领导好，团结大家是很重要的，这方面今后要改进。
    李永说：
    “不是说机车人员要大调整吗？把我调到别的车上就什么问题也没有了。”
    张代表说：
    “领导方法如果不改进，到哪个车上也会有问题；只要改进了，在‘毛泽东号’还一样能搞好，你再想一想吧。”
    李永出来的时候，仍然没有什么信心。
