[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Jing Si Hai (Jishuitan, Shicha Houhai, Qianhai, Xixiaohai) dredging project has been completed. Currently, the construction of revetments, docks, and sluice gates is underway, and the entire project is expected to be completed by the end of October. The Beijing Municipal People's Government had already completed the dredging of the Jin River, Chang River, inner and outer city moats, Qian San Men moat, and Tongzi River, totaling 59 kilometers in length, as well as the San Hai (Beihai, Zhonghai, and Nanhai) with an area of 864,000 square meters, in the first half of this year. In order to quickly complete the restoration of the original river and lake system and improve environmental sanitation, after the completion of the San Hai project, the Si Hai project, which was not originally included in this year's plan, was added to this year's work plan.

The Si Hai is located north of the San Hai, covering an area of 291,370 square meters. Due to decades of neglect in dredging, most of the seabed was silted up, and some areas had become rice paddies. Water was only released twice a year, once in the spring when the rice paddies needed water and again in the winter for ice storage. Furthermore, the upstream water supply was insufficient, and most of the outlets were silted up, becoming large stagnant pools, resulting in a large breeding ground for mosquitoes in the summer. The Zhuan Gou (supply canal) along the coast was also very dirty and smelly due to nearby residents dumping sewage.

This project, in addition to dredging and deepening the Si Hai to 1.5 meters at the shore and 2 meters in the center of the sea, also connected Jishuitan, Shicha Houhai, Qianhai, and Xixiaohai with canals. Sluice gates were built at the junctions of each sea to regulate the water levels of each sea, replace the old water with new, and eliminate mosquito larvae. The original Zhuan Gou was abandoned. The entire dredging project excavated more than 280,000 cubic meters of earth, and has now been completed. In order to prevent coastal collapse and seabed siltation during the rainy season, 6 kilometers of new straight and sloping revetments and 12 docks have been built along the Si Hai and the canals. The Sanitation Engineering Bureau is currently rushing to complete the repairs day and night.

　　京四海疏浚工程完成
    几十年淤积的污泥一扫而清
    【京市新闻处讯】四海（积水潭、什刹后海、前海、西小海）疏浚工程已完成；现正砌筑护岸、码头和闸门等，全部工程预计十月底即可竣工。京市人民政府曾于今年上半年将自玉泉山起至通惠河止的金河、长河、内外城护城河、前三门护城河、筒子河等共长五十九公里的河道及面积八十六万四千平方公尺的三海疏浚完毕；为了尽速完成恢复原有河湖系统，改善环境卫生的工作，于三海工程完成后，又将原未列入本年计划的四海工程追入本年工作计划。四海位于三海以北，面积二十九万一千三百七十平方公尺，由于几十年来未经疏浚，海底大部淤塞，部分地区变成稻田，只每年春季稻田需水时及冬季窖冰时放水二次，加以上游无充足水量供给，出水口亦大部淤塞成为大的死水坑，每至夏季蚊虫大量滋生。沿海的转沟（供水渠）亦因附近居民倾倒秽水，臭气很大，十分肮脏。这次工程除将四海疏浚加深至岸边一公尺五，海中二公尺外并将积水潭、什刹后海、前海、西小海以运河打通，于各海衔接处兴建水闸，调剂各海水位，更换新水，杜绝孑孓。原有的转沟则予废弃。全部疏浚工程共出土二十八万余公方，现已完工。为了防止雨季海岸塌陷，淤积海底，四海及各运河沿岸并新筑直墙及斜坡式两种护岸长六公里，码头十二个，现卫生工程局正日夜赶修中。
