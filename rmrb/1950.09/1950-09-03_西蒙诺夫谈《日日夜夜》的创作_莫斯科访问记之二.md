Simonov on the Creation of "Days and Nights"
    ——Second Moscow Visit Log
    Liu Baiyu

    Before recounting my visit with Comrade Simonov, I cannot help but recall a past event.

    It was in the harsh winter of 1946, when I departed from Harbin via Qiqihar to the front lines. In a railway car, I saw a political commissar at the car door, engrossed in reading a book by the light. When it got dark, he moved to a corner of the car and lit a candle, continuing to read the same book. That book was Simonov's "Days and Nights". Speaking of 1946, the Chinese people will remember the immense difficulties we were experiencing at that time. Outside the car, it was a frozen world, with wind and snow raging. In the rapid and monotonous sound of the wheels, I pondered, thinking that perhaps I would be in battle tomorrow—let him go to war with the will and emotions from the book! Now, I recall this event to remind us that the connection between Simonov and Chinese readers was not on a quiet desk, but in the struggle of blood and flesh.

    Many people say that after reading Simonov's works, they always feel a burning, fiery power within the book. I think this does not come from elsewhere; it comes from the characters in the book like Shaburov, Maslennikov, Anna, from every Soviet general and soldier...because they are new people. Their thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, that is, their character, are the noble character of truly Soviet people. It infects you, inspires you, and allows you to advance bravely in the struggle. The Soviet people and the Soviet state have grown together for many years, new people have matured, and as a writer, Simonov was the first to bring the new people and the new world into literary and artistic works in such a perfect, natural, and confident way, not superficially but essentially, in that era of life-and-death struggle. Therefore, I often think not only of Shaburov, Maslennikov, Anna, and Prochenko, but even more of Simonov, the close connection between the writer and the heroes he created.

    Now, I first recall that Moscow evening of June 15th, when Simonov invited us at the "Literary Gazette" to draw up a schedule for our (Comrade Li Bo and I) visit to Moscow, and then he invited us to go out together. The "Literary Gazette"—that secluded Obekinsky Lane, west of the Kremlin. As soon as we came out, the car turned a corner and headed east along the Moscow River from the south side of the Kremlin. You know, Moscow's summer nights are so beautiful, the Moscow River ripples with soft light, and the fir trees emit a deep dark green. Simonov pointed to the Soviet Palace with a red flag on its bright dome, and then to the solemn Red Square—Gorky Street was ablaze with lights…The car stopped, and we got out. He suddenly took my arm and pointed to the front and back: "That is the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, that is the Moscow City Soviet, this place is called Soviet Square." In this night scene of the square, I seemed to see the spray of the fountain. Everything was so happy and ideal.

    He led us into a nearby Georgian restaurant. The windows of this restaurant were painted with Georgian specialties—purple grapes. I know Georgia is Stalin's hometown.

    If Simonov left me with the impression of a mature politician at the Chinese People's Congress for the Defense of World Peace in Beijing on October 2, 1949, then that evening, I saw his poet's emotions. Of course, in Simonov, this is a very complete and unified impression. Remembering how long and significant the fighting course experienced by the people of China and the Soviet Union is, we feel even more how pleasant and happy today's meeting is. That evening, during the time of drinking, I don't know how, the host and guests talked about the difficult past suffered by their own people. Simonov, after thinking for a while, began to talk, he talked slowly, but very deeply.

    "Sitting here, I recall Stalingrad. When I was fourteen years old, I worked as an apprentice in a factory in Stalingrad. This factory specialized in manufacturing parts for Stalingrad's largest tractor factory. At that time, the young people we worked with together were only thinking about one thing, which was to work better and manufacture more parts for the factory. But twelve years later, when I returned to Stalingrad, I was there as a military reporter, interviewing the war news of Stalingrad. At that time, I saw that such a large city was completely on fire, and the tractor factory was also burning..." Speaking of this, I knew that his emotions were deeply stirred, so he stopped and didn't continue.

    But these few words are so profound, so full of sincerity, every word makes me never forget. Especially from this passage, I understood a truth: without a writer who cherishes sincere feelings for society, life, Stalingrad, and every piece of land, it is impossible to create those sincere heroes in the fiery struggle, and their thoughts and feelings, like in "Days and Nights." Simonov was born in 1915. That is to say, he was only a two-year-old child when the Great Russian October Revolution took place in 1917. He was born in those revolutionary years that shook the world. From then on, the life and experience of the Soviet state became his personal life and experience. He himself is a new person. In the characters he created, there are his own thoughts, feelings, and common destiny. He injected his blood into his works. His characters are shining, and his works are shining.

    During and after the meeting of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, I saw Simonov several times. Once was at the presidium meeting of the Soviet Writers' Association, once was when he accompanied us to visit the Literary University, and once was when he led us to visit the "Literary Gazette," but our formal visit to him was delayed until late July. I think this may be due to his humility. In reality? He did go to the Black Sea for work.

    The day of the scheduled visit was set at ten o'clock in the evening. We arrived at his residence on time, which is in a red building about a hundred steps away from the famous Pushkin bronze statue. He lives on the seventh floor. He greeted us into his studio, and after we sat down, he asked us to forgive him for finishing reading the newspaper proofs spread out on the table. I took this moment to observe Simonov's studio. This is a narrow and long room, with a large window overlooking Gorky Street, where you can see the neon lights of "Izvestia." Next to the window is a huge fan-shaped desk. I don't know why it reminds me of a good military conference table. You see, isn't it very convenient to spread out maps? The table is empty, with a large desk lamp, a large photograph of his wife Valentina Serova, and a few pipes and stationery. Just like the host's experience, this room also has the characteristics of a soldier and a writer: simple and unadorned. On the wall next to the window are nailed two small photos of himself, which you can tell were taken on the front lines of the Soviet-German War. After he finished the phone call and put the newspaper proofs in a paper clip, he habitually turned around, smiled at us slightly, and said, "Sometimes it is also necessary to criticize. We always try to do our work better."

    When our conversation touched on the central issue of "Days and Nights," he stood up and invited us to go to the corridor to see his materials. In that corridor-like passage, along one wall, there were four huge glass cabinets in a row. He opened the lock and opened the cabinet doors. Inside, everything was neatly arranged, one stack after another, all his materials. This is simply an astonishing ocean! …Next to it is a small room, the work room of his white-haired secretary (shorthand, typing—who has always been with him on the front lines). There is also a bookcase here, which is also full of Simonov's materials. He brought fifteen huge volumes of materials back to the studio from the middle. He patted these materials and told us, "This is all the material for 'Days and Nights.'" At this time, he opened two packages in front of us. Inside were the initial materials recorded on the Stalingrad front line. Just like those various, different-sized and colored notebooks that we used to use in the war environment, the slightly wrinkled and damaged covers, and the dense handwriting made you recall the infinite memories of the war from these notebooks, how much hardship! And how much victory! He smiled and raised three of the huge volumes and said, "This is the original manuscript of 'Days and Nights'!" Then he raised another two bundles and said, "The second revision—two volumes!" "This is the third time, which is the current 'Days and Nights'."

    To make us understand more specifically, he turned around and found a huge photo album: "These are the photos from the Stalingrad front line…" He showed us two pages. He pointed to several writers who took photos together at the time, and he raised his head and looked at us: "Several of them have sacrificed!" I saw a picture of a blazing fire on the other side of the Volga River. Another was crossing the river. There was also a picture of Simonov inspecting in a broken house on the front line. There was also a fountain in the center of Stalingrad. Every scene was movingly described by Simonov in "Days and Nights." Especially the fountain, you can tell at a glance that it was the place where Shaburov passed through the first night attack after crossing the Volga River when he charged to seize the building. Simonov said, "It's here!"

    After putting the materials on the bookshelf, he sat down and answered some of the questions we raised. He smoked his pipe and said:

    "I started the creation of "Days and Nights" by going to Stalingrad. I went there as a reporter. At that time, I was working for the military newspaper "Red Star". When we arrived in Stalingrad, I wrote some dispatches from there. One of these dispatches was called "Days and Nights"."

    "If comrades remember a scene in "Days and Nights," that is, the scene where Shaburov and Anna crossed the Volga River and met each other. This scene is also in that dispatch. We crossed the river like that. I met a girl there—a nurse. I had several conversations with her, and I described this conversation in this dispatch. Of course, I never met her again later. As for Shaburov, that is another matter."

    "Later, I returned from Stalingrad. Seven months passed. Spring of 1943 came. At that time, the front line entered the quietest stage, which was the longest period of silence in the war. There were very few battles. This was around May-June 1943, before the Battle of Kursk. I got two months of vacation, and I decided to write a novel about Stalingrad. The first draft of the novel was dictated to a stenographer."

    "At that time, we already understood that Stalingrad was a symbol of our future victory. And, if we continue to fight like we fought in Stalingrad, then we will definitely win. Therefore, like other writers, I felt that publicizing the experience of Stalingrad was very important for future battles. This was my task."

    "But in addition to the task, there is also the feeling of the writer, the feeling of what happened in Stalingrad. My feeling there was very real. When I got off the plane 100 kilometers away from Stalingrad, I felt very scared, and I felt that something terrible happened there, in Stalingrad."

    "But when I arrived on the bank of the Volga River and saw people constantly crossing to the other side under artillery fire, I felt that the terror was reduced a little. And when I crossed the river and arrived in Stalingrad, I felt much less terror than 100 kilometers away. Why? - I asked myself. Is it because I am such a brave person? No, not because of this, I still felt terrible. But, I saw that people don't feel terror because they are engaged in a cause, because they are working all the time. Because the battle of Stalingrad, this is the most arduous work I have ever seen in the war. They don't think like this: we are heroes, we will win. They know this, they know we will win, but they also know: we need to do this, we need to do that, we need to defend this house, we need to occupy this block at what time today."

    "The combination of extremely lofty ideals, extremely lofty thoughts, and an extremely simple attitude towards life greatly excited me as a writer."

    "I said this because the calm tone and calm style of this novel arise from here."

    "I feel that there should be its own romanticism in every work. The romanticism of Stalingrad lies in the heroic events that occurred, and people's attitude towards these events is extremely simple."

    "The beauty of people lies here. I want to express this beauty, and I consciously do this throughout the novel."

    "If comrades remember the passage where Regiment Commander Pavchenko was killed, I consciously arranged this episode. A person who fights so flamboyantly and puts himself under gunfire so unreasonably cannot fight well in Stalingrad."

    "If many people were like Pavchenko, we would not have won the victory in Stalingrad, although he was a brave person and loyal to the motherland."

    "In Stalingrad, those who won were those who were calm, strong, and had a calm and familiar attitude towards their duties."

    "I try to describe Shaburov as such a person."

    "When I conceived the structure of this novel, the main factor of the novel structure for me was that it went through sixty days and sixty nights from beginning to end. The first draft of this novel was called "Sixty Days and Nights" (two months)."

    "And, in this novel, there were initially many superfluous and unnecessary things. At that time, a lot of Shaburov's life was written in this novel. This life accounted for one hundred and fifty pages."

    "I initially thought: Shaburov is a protagonist. Since he is a protagonist, the reader should know everything about him. Since the reader should know everything, that is to say, I should narrate his life, his life from childhood."

    "But when I continued to write the novel, I suddenly realized that this was not so interesting to the reader. What the reader is interested in is what Shaburov did in Stalingrad. It is not because Shaburov came here to defend Stalingrad that the reader is interested in Stalingrad, but because Shaburov fought in Stalingrad that the reader is interested in Shaburov."

    "And I understood that if I describe Shaburov's battle in Stalingrad well, then the reader can easily imagine how he lived before and how he will live after. I deleted that large section (one hundred and fifty pages about life) altogether."

    "Later, there was such a plot in my novel that one of Shaburov's soldiers was a spy. And, I felt that I described it very interestingly. At first, we felt that he was a good person, then we began to suspect that he was a bad person, then he injured Shaburov, and finally he was discovered. I felt that this was very important to the theme, and even wrote this paragraph in the first draft of my novel. But later I thought about it, this spy has no meaning to the theme. I thought, is there anything more meaningful than the theme - Stalingrad itself? I understood that there can only be one theme in a novel about Stalingrad, the most meaningful theme: Hitler boasted that he would occupy Stalingrad tomorrow, but Shaburov and thousands of people like him refused to hand over Stalingrad tomorrow. The next day, Hitler boasted again that he would occupy Stalingrad, but Shaburov refused to hand it over again. This continued for sixty days and sixty nights. There have been spies in Stalingrad, just like there have been spies in the war as usual, but it is meaningless to juxtapose the story of a spy with this, and I understand that it is meaningless to be with the theme. So I deleted this point as well."

    "In this way, the structure of the novel became clear, and the structure finally took shape."

    "After that, I had a question: how to end this novel?"

    "The battle of Stalingrad has two stages: our defensive period and offensive period. When I wrote this novel in 1943, we were facing extremely difficult struggles in the future. Of course, I knew that the Battle of Stalingrad ended with the complete defeat of the German army, but I didn't want to show this defeat. I wanted to show the defense, and end with our turning to the offensive. No need to have a perfect ending, we won. Of course we will win, but I want to give the reader a sense of confidence in victory and a sense of the difficulties we are currently facing. Therefore, I ended the social life aspects of the novel with the first day of our offensive. As for the personal life aspects, I felt that this ending was also correct, even if the reader has a question: can't be sure whether Anna will live or Xiao will live?"

    "In the last chapter of my novel, Maslennikov died in battle. Of course, I wrote it this way intentionally. I want to use all the descriptions of Shaburov in the novel to convince the reader that he will not be killed, and he is still alive at the end of the novel. In that passage where he crawled back and forth three times in seemingly impossible environments, I tried to emphasize this point."

    "As for Anna, that is to say, the personal fate of these two people, the possibility of their future happiness, I left the problem unresolved, just like this problem was unresolved for everyone in the war."

    "And, I feel that if it is written as a perfect happiness, Anna recovers her health, everything is good, this will be wrong. I feel that it is wrong to write it like this in the war at that time. Maybe this happy ending will make the reader like it, but I think writing such a happy ending is to deceive the reader, because in fact, in 1942, one's fate cannot be determined, who will live and who will die."

    "This is some of the imagination I want to say about this novel."

    He stopped, but we were already attracted by his conversation.

    At this time, we asked him another question: "To what extent is Shaburov's image fictional? To what extent is it real?"

    He said: "It's fictional. That is to say, I met a person in Stalingrad, and I started from this person, that is to say, from him, I came up with an idea: it would be good to express such a person. But, generally speaking, this image is fictional. As for Maslennikov, I did meet such a boy in Stalingrad, that is Shemashko's nephew. I described Maslennikov from him, but he was still alive after the Battle of Stalingrad, but he died in battle under the city of Smolensk a year later."

    I asked: "So, when you wrote Shaburov, did you synthesize the characteristics of the heroes you saw on various battlefields?"

    He nodded: "Yes, generally speaking, I have collected the characteristics of many people. In addition, I have instilled my thoughts into him. He is my mouthpiece. He is a propagandist of my view of war. Through him, in his words, I said my view of war, said how to treat career, treat women, treat comrades, etc. Before this novel, I mostly wrote poetry. And as a poet, I must choose a role, through this role I can speak for myself, express my thoughts. So I chose Shaburov."

    I asked the last question, I think this is very meaningful for our Chinese writers: "When you were in Stalingrad, did you think about writing a novel?"

    "I didn't think about writing a novel in Stalingrad, I only thought about it later. I couldn't think about novels there - there was no time to think about novels. There I tried my best to write a few more reports and dispatches, and I had no other thoughts besides that. And that dispatch entitled "Days and Nights" was not written, but directly sent from the front-line shelter to the Moscow editorial department by telegraph machine, because that was the only opportunity."

    It was already twelve o'clock in the evening. He apologized that his wife Serova had gone to the hospital to accompany her because her young daughter was sick. He said that he could only invite us to go out for dinner. After a busy day's work, he suggested: In Moscow on such a night, it might be good for us to take a walk. He took a thick cane and walked down the stairs with us.

    The streets of Moscow were very quiet late at night. We walked and talked. Simonov's words are always so humorous and profound. When we passed the beautiful building of the Ministry of Construction, he suddenly pointed to the red stones that looked very clean under the street lights and said, "These were originally stones prepared by Hitler in Finland. He planned to occupy Moscow and build his victory monument!" When we crossed Gorky Street, the widest street in Moscow, he suddenly stopped in the center of the road and told us, "Originally this street was only this wide, now the houses have moved there!" He pointed to the opposite side, because tomorrow we will go to Yasnaya Polyana, 400 miles away from Moscow, the hometown of L. Tolstoy, so he talked about the famous products of Tula: guns, copper samovars and biscuits... When I walked and listened to him, I felt that every word of his was permeated with deep love. - He is glued to every inch of land in the Soviet state, and he is connected by flesh and blood with every development in the Soviet state. Listening to the quiet footsteps in the late night, at this time, I felt that from his image I saw the image of the entire Soviet Union.

    This time it was in an Armenian restaurant. The restaurant manager Agsayvan personally greeted us. He wore five medals on his chest. Because he is not only a hero in the Patriotic War, but also a hero in defending the Soviet regime after the October Revolution. We especially raised a glass to him, and he replied to us with moving sincerity: "If China needs help, I will definitely be the first to step forward, regardless of my life!" China-Soviet Union, Beijing-Moscow, this is the friendship of brothers. Now I don't want to record every word that was said at that time, but I can't help but record a passage from Simonov. Because I talked about how the Chinese people hated the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek, he talked about the surrender in Berlin - he stood behind General Zhukov and personally participated in this historically significant surrender. General Zhukov said, "Bring him in!" The German Marshal came in, and he was holding a cane that represented his status. Zhukov ordered him to sit on that side. At this time, the criminal wanted to pretend to be calm and not look, but he couldn't help but look, to see what kind of people defeated them. He thought he would send the surrender document and ask him to sign it, but instead he was asked to come over - he walked over, took off his gloves, signed, and forgot to put on his gloves. He wanted to cry, but he leaned back and suppressed his tears. It seems that some people may find it pitiful. But at this time, I thought of the days when the war started, the Soviet refugees retreating on the Smolensk Highway in Belarus, the ruthless strafing by the German Kou - they had no pity at all at that time. ...

    Now, what else to say? The road to the world is clear and definite - Stalin is pointing in this direction, and the peace-loving people will surely defeat the war provocateurs. I want to end with the words Simonov said at the first gathering on the evening of June 15th. His words were: "True friendship is engaging in a common cause, fighting against a common enemy, sharing hardships and difficulties. Now the people of China and the Soviet Union are engaged in a common cause, defending world peace; fighting against a common enemy - imperialism... our friendship is unbreakable."

    Finally, let us remember the influence Simonov left us! - His works, his path, teach us where to go, how to work, how to fight. We know that without Simonov in the Battle of Nomonhan, without Simonov on the Finnish front, without Simonov under the artillery fire of Stalingrad, there would be no Simonov who created "Days and Nights". Now, in the era of fighting for peace, in my meeting with him in Moscow, I feel that he is working and fighting as intensely and wholeheartedly as he was during the war, and he is smiling as much. Simonov is the vice chairman of the Soviet Writers' Association, a deputy to the Supreme Soviet, the editor-in-chief of "Literary Gazette", and his book "Fighting China" has recently been completed. Simonov often works until late at night. On the night I left Moscow, it was already one o'clock in the morning when I went to say goodbye to him. He was having a meeting in his editorial department. I cannot forget that late at night, Obekinsky Lane was deserted. He stood at the entrance of "Literary Gazette" and waved to us, waved to us. I cannot forget that he is so energetic, never tired, always working hard, smiling victoriously, and moving forward tirelessly...

　　西蒙诺夫谈《日日夜夜》的创作
    ——莫斯科访问记之二
    刘白羽
    在记述我对于西蒙诺夫同志的访问之前，我不能不想起过去的一件事。
    那是一九四六年严冬，我从哈尔滨经齐齐哈尔出发到前线去。在一节铁罐军用车厢上，我看见一位政治委员在车门口，就着光线，出神地读一本书。天黑了，他移到车厢角落里，点起一只蜡烛，还是继续读这本书。这本书就是西蒙诺夫的《日日夜夜》。提起一九四六年，中国人民会记得那时我们正经历着多么大的困难。车厢以外，冰天冻地，风雪满天。我在那急速而单调的车轮声中沉思，我想明天也许就要战斗，——让他就带着书中的意志与感情去作战吧！现在，我回忆起这一件事，是为了让我们记着这一点：西蒙诺夫与中国读者的结合，不是在寂静的书桌上，而是在血肉斗争中。
    不少人说，读过西蒙诺夫的作品之后，总觉得书中有一种火热的力量在燃烧。我想这不是从旁处来的，这来自书中的人物像沙布洛夫，马斯林尼可夫，安娘，来自每一个苏维埃将军与士兵，……因为他们是新的人物。他们的思想、感情与信念，就是说他们的品德，是真正苏维埃人的崇高品德。它感染你、鼓舞你，让你在斗争中勇往前进。苏维埃人和苏维埃国家共同生长了若干年代，新的人物成熟了，而作为一个作家，西蒙诺夫是第一个那样完美地，那样自然地，那样确信地，不是表面而是本质地，在那生死斗争的年代，把新的人与新的世界带到文学艺术作品中间来。因此，我常常思索的不仅是沙布洛夫，马斯林尼可夫，安娘以及普罗琴科，而更多的是西蒙诺夫，是作家与他所创造的英雄之间的密切联系。
    现在，我首先记起六月十五日莫斯科那一个夜晚，西蒙诺夫邀请我们在《文学报》社会面，为我们（立波同志和我）拟订了一个访问莫斯科的日程，然后他邀我们一起出去。《文学报》社——那一条幽僻的欧贝金斯基巷在克里姆林宫的西方。我们一出来，汽车拐过弯就从克里姆林宫南面顺着莫斯科河东行。你知道，莫斯科的夏夜是多么美丽，莫斯科河荡着柔和的闪光，枞树发出深沉的墨绿色。西蒙诺夫一会指着雪亮的圆顶上插着一面红旗的苏维埃宫，一会又指着庄严的红场，——高尔基大街上一片灯火辉煌，……汽车停止，我们下来。他忽然拉着我的臂肘，指着前面和后面：“那是马恩列学院，那是莫斯科市苏维埃，这里就叫苏维埃广场。”在这广场夜景中，我似乎看见了喷水池的水花。一切是这样的幸福与理想。
    他引我们走进旁边一家乔治亚饭馆，这个饭馆窗上画着乔治亚的特产——紫葡萄。我知道乔治亚是斯大林的故乡。
    如果说一九四九年十月二日，在北京的中国保卫世界和平大会上，西蒙诺夫留给我的印象是一个成熟的政治家，那么这晚上，我看见了他的诗人的情绪。当然，在西蒙诺夫身上，这是一个非常完整而统一的印象。记着中国与苏联这两大国家人民所经历的战斗路程是多么长远，意义是多么重大，我们就更感觉到今天的会面是多么的愉快和幸福。那晚上，在喝酒的时间，不知怎样，主人与客人都谈到自己人民所遭受的艰难的过去。西蒙诺夫，沉思了一下，谈起来，他谈得很缓慢，但是很深沉。
    “坐在这里，回想起斯大林格勒。当我十四岁的时候，我在斯大林格勒一个工厂做学徒。这个工厂是专门为斯大林格勒最大的拖拉机工厂制造零件的。当那个时候，我们在一起工作的年青人，都只想着一件事，就是更好地工作，更多地为工厂制造零件。可是过了十二年后，再到斯大林格勒，我是作为一个军事记者，采访斯大林格勒战争消息。那时我看见，这样大的城市完全着了火，拖拉机厂也烧在火里了，……”讲到这里，我知道他的情感是深深激动了，他也就停止而没有说下去。
    但这几句话是那样深刻，那样富于真情，每一个字都使我永久不能淡忘。特别是从这段话里，我懂得了一个真理：没有对于社会、生活、斯大林格勒，每一片土地怀着真挚情感的作家，也就无法创造像“日日夜夜”里面那种火热斗争中的真挚的英雄人物，和他们的思想与感情。西蒙诺夫生于一九一五年。那就是说一九一七年伟大俄罗斯十月革命时他还只是一个两岁的幼儿。他诞生在那震动世界的革命年月里。从此苏维埃国家的生活与经历便是他个人的生活与经历。他自己就是一个新的人物，在他所创造的人物中就有着他自己的思想、感情与共同的命运，他以他的血液注入了他的作品，他的人物是发光的，他的作品是发光的。
    在苏联最高苏维埃代表会议开会期间和以后，我有好几次看到西蒙诺夫。一次是在苏联作家协会主席团会议上，一次是他陪我们访问文学大学，一次是他领我们参观《文学报》，但我们对他的正式访问，却延迟到七月下旬。我想这也许是由于他的谦逊。实际呢？他确实因为工作关系曾经远离莫斯科而到黑海去了一趟。
    约好访问的那一天，时间订的是夜晚十点钟。我们按时赶到了他的寓所，就是在那出名的普式金青铜像旁约一百步的一幢红色楼房里面。他住在第七层。他迎接我们进入他的工作室，让我们坐下之后，他请我们原谅他要把摊在桌上的报纸清样看完。我倒正好利用这时刻观察西蒙诺夫的工作室。这是一间窄长房屋，一面大窗外是高尔基大街，可看见《消息报》的霓红灯。临窗放着一张巨大的扇面形的书桌。不知怎样让我想到这是很好的军事会议的桌子。你看，铺展开地图不是十分方便吗？桌上面空空的，一只大台灯，一张他的夫人瓦伦汀娜·塞罗娃的大像片，此外就是几根烟斗和文具。正如主人的经历，这屋内也有着军人与作家的特色：简单、朴质。窗旁边的墙壁上钉着两张他自己的小照片，一看就知道那还是在苏德战争前线留下来的。他讲完电话，把报纸清样放在一只纸夹内，然后习惯地转过身来朝着我们微微一笑，说：“有时也需要责备，我们总是尽量想把工作做得更好。”
    当我们谈话接触到中心问题《日日夜夜》时，他站起来，邀请我们到过道里去看看他的材料。在那条走廊似的过道内，顺着一面墙脚，一溜摆着四只巨大的玻璃柜。他打开锁头，敞开橱门。那里面井井有条，一叠一叠，完全是他的材料。这简直是惊人的渊海！……旁边一间小屋，是他那位白发女书记（速记、打字、——跟他一直上前线）的工作间，这里还有一只书橱，里面也满满盛着西蒙诺夫的材料。他从这中间抱了十五巨册材料回到工作室来，他拍着这些材料告诉我们：“这是全部《日日夜夜》的材料。”这时他就在我们面前打开两包，里面是在斯大林格勒火线上所记录的最初素材，这也正如同我们在战争环境中，惯常使用的那些各色各样，大小颜色不相同的笔记本一样，微微揉皱与破损的封皮，密密的字迹，让你从这些本子引起无限战争的回忆，多少艰难！又多少胜利！他微笑着举起其中三巨册说：“这是《日日夜夜》最初的原稿！”然后又举起另外两束说：“第二次修改——两本！”“这是第三次，也就是现在的《日日夜夜》了。”
    为了让我们了解得更具体，他转过身去找了一本巨大照像簿来：“这是斯大林格勒前线的照片，……”他掀给我们看了两页。他指着当时一起合照的几位作家，他抬起头来望望我们：“这里面的几个已经牺牲了！”我看见一张是从伏尔加河边看彼岸一片熊熊大火。另一张正在渡河。还有一张是西蒙诺夫在前线阵地一间破房内视察。还有一张是斯大林格勒市中心的喷水池。每一张情景，都是西蒙诺夫在《日日夜夜》中动人地描写过的。特别是喷水池，一看就知道，那是沙布洛夫过伏尔加河后第一夜的攻击，抢占楼房时冲锋经过的地方。西蒙诺夫说：“就是这里！”
    把材料放在书架上，他坐下回答我们提出的若干问题，他吸着烟斗说起来：
    “我是以赴斯大林格勒而开始《日日夜夜》的创作的，我是作为一个记者到那儿去的。我那时担任军事报纸《红星报》的工作，当我们到达斯大林格勒时，我从那里写了一些通讯，这些通信中有一篇叫做《日日夜夜》。
    “假如同志们记得《日日夜夜》中有一个场面，就是沙布洛夫与安娘同渡伏尔加河，与她相识的那个场面。这一个场面在那篇通讯中也有。我们也就是那样渡过河的，我在那里遇见了一位姑娘——女护士，与她作了几次谈话，并且我把这次谈话描写在这篇通讯中。当然后来我没有再遇到她。而沙布洛夫，则是另外一回事。
    “后来，我从斯大林格勒回来了。过了七个月。一九四三年春天来临了，当时前线进入了最沉寂的阶段，这是战争中最长时间的沉寂，战事很少，这是在一九四三年五——六月左右，是在库尔斯克弧形阵地会战之前。我得到两个月休假，我就决定了写一本关于斯大林格勒的小说。小说的第一次稿本我是口述给速记员记的。
    “那时，我们已经明白，斯大林格勒是我们未来的胜利的象征。并且，假如我们会继续这样作战，像在斯大林格勒作战一样，那么，我们一定会胜利。因此，和别的作家们一样，我觉得宣传斯大林格勒的经验对于未来的战斗是很重要的，这就是我的任务。
    “但是除任务之外，还有作家的感觉，对斯大林格勒所发生的事情的感觉。我在那里的感觉是很确实的。当我在离斯大林格勒一百公里的地方走下飞机时，我觉得很可怕，并且觉得在那里，在斯大林格勒发生了某种恐怖的事。
    “但当我到了伏尔加河岸边，并且看到人们冒着炮火不断地渡到那边去，我已经觉得恐怖减少些了。而当我渡过了河，已经到达斯大林格勒时，我觉得比在一百公里以外恐怖减少得多了。为什么呢？——我问自己。因为我是这样勇敢的人吗？不，不是因为这个，我总还是感到可怕的。但是，我看到，人们之所以不感到恐怖，是因为他们在从事一种事业，因为他们时时刻刻在工作。因为斯大林格勒的战斗，这是我在战争中所看到的一种最艰苦的工作。他们并不这么想：我们是英雄，我们会胜利。他们知道这一点，知道我们会胜利，但是，他们也知道：需要做这个，需要做这件事，要守住这栋房屋，要在今天几点钟占领这个街区。
    “极崇高的理想，极崇高的思想和对生活极朴实的态度的结合，使作为一个作家的我极为兴奋，激动。
    “我说到这一点，因为这本小说的镇静的色调，镇静的风格是从这里产生的。
    “我觉得在每一部作品中应该有它的浪漫性，斯大林格勒的浪漫性在于发生了英雄的事件，而人们对这些事件的态度却是极简单。
    “人们的美就在这里，我想表现这种美，并且我有意识地在整部小说中做到这一点。
    “假如同志们记得团长巴甫琴科被打死的那一段，我是有意识地按排这一支插曲的。一个这样炫耀地作战，这样没有理智地将自己置于枪弹之下的人，在斯大林格勒是不能很好地作战的。
    “假如许多人都像巴甫琴科一样，我们就不会在斯大林格勒打胜仗，虽然他是勇敢的人，并且是忠于祖国的人。
    “在斯大林格勒是那些镇静的、坚强的、对自己的天职抱着镇静的熟悉业务态度的人们战胜的。
    “我就力求将沙布洛夫描写成这样一个人。
    “当我构思这小说的结构时，对于我，小说结构的主要因素是从头到尾经过了六十个白昼与六十个黑夜。这小说第一次草稿就叫做《六十昼夜》（两个月）。
    “并且，在这本小说中，起初有许多多余的，不需要的东西。当时，在这小说中沙布洛夫的生平写得很多，这生平占了一百五十页。
    “我起初以为：沙布洛夫是一个主角，既然他是主角，读者应该知道他的一切，既然读者应该知道一切，就是说我应当叙述他的生平，从童年时代起的生平。
    “但是当我继续写小说的时候，我突然明了这一点并不是读者那么感兴趣的，读者所感兴趣的事，是沙布洛夫在斯大林格勒所作的事。并不是因为沙布洛夫来到这里保卫斯大林格勒，所以读者对斯大林格勒感到兴趣，而是，因为沙布洛夫在斯大林格勒作战，所以读者对沙布洛夫感兴趣。
    “并且我明白了，假如我将沙布洛夫在斯大林格勒怎样作战的情形描写得很好，那么，读者容易想像到他以前是怎样生活和他以后将怎样生活。我就将那一大段（关于生平的一百五十页）统统删掉了。
    “后来，在我的小说中有这样一段情节，沙布洛夫的一个兵士是间谍，并且，我觉得，我描写得很有趣，起初我们觉得他是一个好人，后来开始怀疑他是坏人，后来他打伤了沙布洛夫，而最后发觉了他。我觉得这对于主题是很重要的，甚至在我小说的初稿中写下了这一段。但是后来我想了一想，这个间谍对于主题任何意义都没有。我想难道有什么东西比主题——斯大林格勒本身更有意义吗？我明白了，关于斯大林格勒的小说中只能有一种题材，最有意义的题材：希特勒夸口明天占领斯大林格勒，沙布洛夫及千万像他这样的人，明天却不肯交出斯大林格勒。第二天希特勒又夸口占领斯大林格勒，而沙布洛夫又不肯交出它。就这样继续了六十个白天和六十个夜晚。在斯大林格勒曾经有过间谍，也像往常在战争中有过间谍一样，然而把一个间谍的故事和这并列是毫无意义的，而且我明白这和主题在一起是没有意义的。于是我将这一点也删掉了。
    “这样，小说的结构就弄清楚了，结构终于形成了。
    “往后，我就发生了一个问题：怎样结束这篇小说呢？
    “在斯大林格勒的战役有两个阶段：我们的防御时期和进攻时期。当我在一九四三年写这本小说时，我们面临着未来极艰苦的斗争。当然，我知道，斯大林格勒战役是以完全击溃德军为结束的，但是我不想表现这击溃，我想表现防御，并且以我们转入进攻为结束。不用完事大吉，我们战胜了作结尾。当然我们会胜利，但是我想使读者产生对胜利的信心的感觉和对目前面临着的困难的感觉，因此我用我们进攻的第一天来结束小说的社会生活方面的描写，至于个人生活方面的描写，我觉得这样结尾也是正确的，即使读者发生一个疑问：不能确实知道安娘会活下去呢？还是小会活下去呢？
    “在我的小说最后一章，马斯林尼可夫战死了，当然我是有意这样写的。我想用小说中对沙布洛夫的一切描写来使读者深信他不会被打死，并且到小说结尾他还活着。在他三次处于似乎不可能的环境中，往返爬行那一段，我努力强调了这一点。
    “至于安娘，即是说这两个人的个人命运，他们的未来幸福的可能性，我把问题这样留着不解决，正如在战争中这问题对于所有的人都是没有解决的一样。
    “并且，我觉得，假如写成美满的幸福，安娘恢复了健康，一切都很好，这将是不对的。我觉得当时在战争中这样写是不对的。也许这幸福的结局会使读者喜欢，但是我认为写成这样幸福的结局就是欺骗读者，因为事实上，一九四二年是不能确定一个人的命运，究竟谁会活下去，谁会死掉。
    “这就是我所想说的关于这本小说的一些想像。”
    他停止了，但我们已为他的谈话所吸引。
    这时候我们又提出一个问题问他：“沙布洛夫的形象，在那种程度上是你所虚构的？在那种程度上是真的？”
    他说：“他是虚构的。就是说我在斯大林格勒碰到过一个人，从这个人做出发点，就是说从他身上我产生了一种思想：假如表现这样一个人是很好的。但是，一般说来，这形象是虚构的。至于马斯林尼可夫，我在斯大林格勒的的确确碰到过这样一个男孩子，那就是谢马什哥的侄儿。我从他身上描写了马斯林尼可夫，不过他在斯大林格勒战役后还活着，而是一年后在斯摩棱斯克城下战死的。”
    我问：“那么，你写沙布洛夫的时候，是不是综合了你在各个战线上所看到的英雄们的特点？”
    他点了点头：“是的，一般说来，我是集合了许多人的特点的。此外，我将自己的思想灌注给他。他是我的传声筒。他是我对战争的看法的宣传者。通过他，用他的话，我说出了对战争的看法，说出了要怎样对待事业，对待妇女和对待同志等等。我在这本小说之前，多半是写诗的。而作为一个诗人，我必需选择一个角色，通过这角色我可以自己说话，说出自己的思想。这样我就选择了沙布洛夫。”
    我问了最后一个问题，我认为这对我们中国作家是很有意义的：“当你在斯大林格勒时，你想到了写小说吗？”
    “在斯大林格勒我没有想到写小说，这是后来才想到的。在那里还想不到小说的事，——还没有时间来想小说的事。在那里我极力想多写几篇报道通讯，除此之外我没有别的思想。而且那篇题名为《日日夜夜》的通讯，不是写的，而是直接在前线掩蔽部里用发报机发送到莫斯科编辑部去，因为那是唯一的一次机会。”
    已经深夜十二点钟了，他抱歉他的夫人塞罗娃因为小女儿生病陪同住医院去了，他说只有约我们到外面去吃晚饭。一天繁忙的工作结束了，他提议：在莫斯科这样的夜晚，我们散散步也许很好。他提了一根粗大的手杖和我们走下楼梯。
    深夜的莫斯科街上十分幽静，我们一边走一边说。西蒙诺夫的话永远是那样幽默而深刻的。当我们从建设部美丽的建筑前面经过，他忽然指着那在街灯照耀之下，显得十分光洁的红石块说：“这原是希特勒在芬兰准备好的石头，他打算占领莫斯科后，来建筑他的胜利纪念碑呢！”当我们横穿过莫斯科最宽的街道——高尔基大街，他忽然在马路中心停着，告诉我们：“原来这街只有这样宽，现在房子移到那里去了！”他指着对面，因为天明以后我们将到远离莫斯科四百里的耶斯那耶·坡里耶拿，Ｌ·托尔斯泰故乡去，他于是谈起图拉的名产：枪，铜茶炊和饼干，……当我跟他一边走一边听的时候，我觉得他的每句话里都渗透了深深的爱情。——他与苏维埃国家每一寸土地都胶合着，他与苏维埃国家每一发展都血肉相联着。听着深夜的静静脚步声，这时，我觉得，从他的形象我看见了整个苏维埃的形象。
    这次是在一家亚美尼亚饭馆里，饭店经理阿格赛凡亲自招待我们，他的胸上佩着五个勋章。因为他不但是卫国战争中的功臣，而且还是十月革命后保卫苏维埃政权时的英雄。我们特别向他举杯，他以动人的真诚回答我们说：“如果中国需要帮助，我一定第一个走在前面，不惜生命！”中国——苏联，北京——莫斯科，这就是兄弟的情谊。现在我不想再记述当时所谈的每一句话，但我却不能不记下西蒙诺夫讲的一段话。由于我谈到中国人民是怎样仇恨战犯蒋介石，他谈到柏林的受降，——他站在朱可夫将军身后，亲自参加了这有历史意义的受降。朱可夫将军说：“带进来！”德国元帅进来了，他手里还拿着一根表示身份的棒，朱可夫命令他坐在那面，这时这个罪犯想装做镇静，不要看，可是不由自主他还是看了，看看战胜他们的是什么样人。他以为会把受降书送过去叫他签字，结果却是叫他过来——他走过来，把手套脱下，签字，手套也就忘记戴了，他想哭，可是他往后仰着头抑制住眼泪。看样子也许有人觉得很可聆。可是这时我想到战争开始的日子，想到在白俄罗斯，在斯摩棱斯克公路上，撤退下来的苏联难民，想到德寇无情的扫射，——那时他们是一点怜惜也没有的。……
    现在，还说什么呢？世界的道路是清楚而明确的，——斯大林指着这个方向，和平人民必将战胜战争挑拨者。我想用西蒙诺夫在第一次，在六月十五那一晚晌的聚会上的话来做个结束，他的话是这样说的：“真正的友谊，是从事于共同的事业，对共同的敌人作斗争，同艰苦，共患难，现在中苏两国人民都从事共同事业，保卫世界和平；都向共同的敌人——帝国主义作斗争，……我们的友谊是坚不可破的。”
    最后，让我们记着西蒙诺夫留给我们的影响吧！——他的作品，他的道路，教会我们应该到什么地方去，应该怎样劳作，应该怎样战斗。我们知道没有诺门坎战役中的西蒙诺夫，没有芬兰战线上的西蒙诺夫，没有斯大林格勒炮火下的西蒙诺夫，也就不会有创造《日日夜夜》的西蒙诺夫。现在在为了和平而斗争的年代里，在我在莫斯科和他的会晤中，我觉得他和战争时期是一样紧张，一样全心全意地工作着，战斗着，也一样微笑着。西蒙诺夫担任着苏联作家协会副主席的职务，还是最高苏维埃代表，是《文学报》总编辑，同时，他的著作《战斗的中国》还于最近全部脱稿。西蒙诺夫经常工作至深夜。我离开莫斯科那一晚，已经深夜一点钟，我去向他告别的时候，他就正在他的编辑部开会。我不能忘记，那深夜，欧贝金斯基巷里寂无一人，他站在《文学报》门口向我们招着手，招着手。我不能忘记，他是那样的精力饱满，永不疲劳，永远在辛勤地工作，在胜利地微笑，在不息地前进……
