　　The Endless Poison of Arranged Marriages
　　Seven Women in Poyang, Jiangxi, Die from Abuse in One Month

　　Editor:

　　Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the broad masses of young men and women – especially women – have been liberated from the long-term, barbaric, and backward feudal marriage system. However, there are still many women who are suffering oppression and harm under feudal ideas that belittle women. Taking Poyang County in Jiangxi Province as an example, in the past month or so, seven incidents of women being abused to death have occurred in succession. Among them, two were murdered, and five committed suicide because they could not bear the abuse; one woman was seriously injured by being hacked. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Court has instructed the Poyang County People's Court to severely punish the perpetrators and use this to educate the masses. Now I will tell you the most tragic facts to attract everyone's attention:

　　1. Wu Manzhu was the daughter of a peddler. Because of the difficult family life, she was given to Kang Buyun as a child bride. On July 13, when the beans were being threshed, Manzhu was suffering from malaria, feeling dizzy and unwell, and she swept the beans while ill. Kang Buyun thought she was not sweeping well and beat her severely. Manzhu was at a loss and still could not sweep well. Kang Buyun continued to beat her with fists and feet, injuring Manzhu's back, chest, and lower abdomen, and seriously injuring her left ear, with half of her face swollen. She immediately fainted on the ground. In the middle of the night, she died of a nosebleed.

　　2. Yang Zaofeng, 18 years old this year, was promised to Zhu Wenhai as a child bride four years ago and was repeatedly abused by her mother-in-law. One day, she rested while chopping firewood outside. Her husband saw this and told his mother. She worked hard all day, and when she returned home in the evening, her mother-in-law forbade her to eat and beat her severely, driving her out of the gate. She wandered all night, felt hopeless, and hanged herself with the rope for tying firewood next to the house.

　　3. Gao Meiying was betrothed to Sun Zao Youzhi's son at the age of ten through a matchmaker. At the age of twenty, she got married. Her mother-in-law often abused her and falsely accused her of having an affair with her father-in-law. Her father-in-law scolded the mother-in-law. Therefore, her mother-in-law hated her even more and often beat and scolded her. Meiying could not bear the abuse and once fled to her parents' home. Later, Meiying returned to her husband's home, and her husband beat her indiscriminately with a carrying pole and iron rake, leaving her covered in bruises. Her mother rushed to her upon hearing the news and took her back home. Her father-in-law sent someone to forcibly take her back to her mother-in-law's house (by boat). On the way, Meiying asked the person who took her back, "Can you guarantee that I won't be beaten this time?" The man said, "That's not guaranteed." Meiying knew that she would definitely be beaten again if she went back, so she took the opportunity to jump into the water and commit suicide!

　　4. Li Dong'e, 21 years old, had been married to Huang Maoshun for four years, and their relationship had always been bad. In June, Li Dong'e had a quarrel with her mother-in-law, and her husband beat her half to death with a wooden stick, and then carried her to the bed and inhumanly killed her with a kitchen knife!

　　包办婚姻遗毒无穷
    江西鄱阳一个月七个妇女被虐待致死编辑同志：
    自从婚姻法颁布后，广大青年男女——尤其是妇女群众，从长期的野蛮落后的封建婚姻制度下解放了出来；但仍有不少妇女群众，至今仍在轻视妇女的封建思想下惨遭压迫、残害。即以江西省鄱阳一县而论，最近一个多月中竟连续七次发生妇女被虐待而致死的事件：其中二个是被杀害的，五个则因不堪虐待而自杀；一个妇女被砍重伤。江西省人民法院为此已指示鄱阳县人民法院严厉惩办犯罪者，并借以教育群众。现在我把其中最惨的几件事实告诉你们，以引起大家的注意：
    一、吴曼珠是一个小贩的女儿，因家中生活困难，就给了康步云做童养媳。七月十三日豆子登场的时候，曼珠正害疟疾，头晕目眩，抱病去扫豆子。康步云嫌她扫得不好，狠狠地痛打她一顿。曼珠手足无措，仍然扫不好。康步云接着拳足交加，打得曼珠背部，胸部、小肚上都受了伤，左耳伤得更重，半个脸都肿了，当即昏倒在地上。半夜她便鼻孔流血而死了。
    二、杨早凤，今年十八岁，四年前许给朱闻海做童养媳，屡受婆婆虐待。有一天，她在外面砍柴时，休息了一下。她丈夫看见了，就告诉母亲。她辛苦地劳动了一天，晚上回来时，婆婆不准她吃饭，还痛打她一顿，把她赶出大门。她彷徨竟夜，感到绝望，就用捆柴的绳子在屋旁上吊了。
    三、高梅英，十岁时凭媒说合给孙灶幼之子为妻。二十岁上，她结了婚。她婆婆常常虐待她，并诬她和公公通奸。公公责骂了婆婆。因此，婆婆更加恨她，更经常打骂她了。梅英不堪虐待，曾一度逃到娘家。后来梅英回到夫家，她的丈夫竟用扁担、铁耙把她乱打，打得她遍体鳞伤。她的母亲闻讯赶去，把她带回家里。她公公却派人去强接她回婆家（乘船）。船行至中途，梅英问接她回去的人说：“这次回去，你能保我不挨打吗？”那人说：“那就不保险。”梅英自知回去一定又要被毒打，便乘隙跳水自杀了！
    四、李冬娥，二十一岁，与黄茂顺结婚已四年，向来感情不好。六月间，李冬娥与婆婆发生口角，她的丈夫就用木棍将她打得半死，并把她抬到床上，毫无人性的用菜刀把她杀死了！
