　　Anguo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Hebei Province
    Purchases Large Quantities of New Cotton
    [Our Dispatch] New cotton has been put on the market in Anguo County, Hebei Province. To protect the interests of cotton farmers, the county supply and marketing cooperative is currently purchasing large quantities of cotton at a cotton-grain ratio of 8 to 10 jin of rice per jin of ginned cotton through district and village cooperatives and markets. The price of unginned cotton purchased at the market is 2,400 yuan per jin, equivalent to 3 jin of good rice.
    On the other hand, in order to solve the difficulties of cotton farmers in obtaining fuel and food, districts with high cotton yields in the first, second, and third production sectors are prioritized. Through village cooperatives, collective contracts are signed with cotton farmers to exchange grain dregs in advance for unginned cotton. Currently, the county has loaned out a total of 206,600 jin of grain dregs, with 8,200 jin of unginned cotton to be recovered; a total of 233,700 jin of coarse grains have been released, with 60,200 jin of unginned cotton to be exchanged. A total of 178 contracts have been signed for the above grain-cotton exchanges.
    Farmers feel that planting cotton makes it easy to obtain food, fuel, and clothing. For example, Wang Lu'er, a cotton farmer from Xibozhang Village who went to the market, said: "This year, the cotton is growing much better than last year. One mu can yield 330 jin, which is equivalent to five mu of grain. When I go to the market to sell cotton, I feel indescribably happy when I see the supply and marketing cooperative buying it. The cooperative buys cotton fairly, without underweighing or suppressing prices, and does not let cotton farmers suffer losses. This spring, I listened to the Communist Party's call to plant cotton and planted 4.6 mu of unginned cotton. The cotton bolls are as big as eggs, and the cotton fibers are snow-white. I estimate that I can harvest more than 1,000 jin. This time, planting cotton was the right thing to do. Next year, I will definitely plant another 1.5 mu."

### 河北安国县供销社大量收购新棉

　　河北安国县供销社
    大量收购新棉
    【本报讯】河北省安国县新棉已经上市，县供销社为保障棉农利益，现正通过区、村社及市场，按每斤皮棉折米八斤至十斤的棉粮比价大量收购。通过集市收的大籽棉每斤二千四百元，合好米三斤。
    另一方面，为解决棉农吃烧困难，以一、二、三产棉较多的区作重点，通过村社，和棉农订立集体合同，以粮砟预换大籽棉。现全县共借出大砟二十万六千六百余斤，应收回大籽棉八千二百余斤；共放出粗粮二十三万三千七百余斤，应换进大籽棉六万零二百余斤。以上粮棉交换，共订立了一百七十八张合同。
    农民感到种棉，吃烧穿衣都不困难。如西伯章村，赶集的棉农王路尔说：“今年大棉花比去年长的强，一亩能摘三百三十斤，合成粮食，一亩能顶五亩谷。赶集出卖大棉花时，一见供销社来收买，心中有说不出的喜欢。合作社买棉，一不压秤，二不压价，公平交易，不让种棉人吃亏。今春我听了共产党种棉大号召，种了四亩六分大籽棉，棉花桃子像鸡蛋大，棉花瓣子雪白，估计能摘一千多斤。这回种棉可闹对了，明年我一定再多种一亩半。”
