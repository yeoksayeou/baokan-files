　　The Good Daughter of the Mosuo People
    ——Remembering He Guoxiu, a Model Laborer of the Yunnan Ethnic Minorities
    Wu Yuanying
    In the far reaches of the motherland, on the banks of the mighty Jinsha River – a grand farewell meeting was held in Xinwen Village, Lijiang County, Yunnan Province, to bid farewell to He Guoxiu, a nineteen-year-old Mosuo girl, as she departed for Beijing to attend the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. As He Guoxiu walked out of the village, all the Mosuo compatriots, looking at He Guoxiu's often smiling face, held her hands and said with deep affection: "Your ability to go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao is not just your personal honor, but the honor of all of us Mosuo people!" When He Guoxiu left Lijiang, the people of Lijiang specially entrusted her to carry a letter to pay their respects to Chairman Mao, and instructed her: "Keep our words firmly in mind, and when you see Chairman Mao, tell him in detail how the working people of the Mosuo people suffered so much in the past, and now that we have him, we have turned ourselves around."

    He Guoxiu, a strong Mosuo daughter of a poor peasant. In the old society, she, like all her Mosuo brothers and sisters, lived an inhuman life. When He Guoxiu was only six or seven years old, she went barefoot into the mountains to herd cattle and horses, often chasing after them while crying.

    At that time, her family of eight, old and young, rented eleven and a half mu of land from the landlord. They worked hard day and night, but after paying the rent with the grain they harvested, it was not enough to eat for three or four months. The overflowing waters of the Jinsha River and the Chongjiang River either damaged the crops or washed them away completely; but the plunder by the reactionaries and landlords did not ease up because of natural disasters. When He Guoxiu was thirteen years old, she shouldered the main labor of the family. During the day, she worked in the fields, chopped firewood in the mountains, and split bamboo; at night, she had to fumble to weave bamboo hats and straw mats. She carried them to the market, a two-day journey to and from, to exchange them for grain. She worked hard all year round, and although she earned the praise and reputation of the whole village, she could not get enough to eat and stay warm. She couldn't help but have a series of doubts about life.

    In 1948, the people's armed forces in Yunnan gradually developed. In the spring of that year, He Guoxiu began to learn from her cousin that the painful life was not destined. If everyone's labor, besides supporting themselves, did not need to pay "tribute" to the landlord, food and clothing could be maintained. The main reason was that one's own labor supported the "parasites," and people had no food and clothing. At the same time, she excitedly learned that in other parts of our country, there was no oppression and fraud by landlords, and there were great people's revolutionary leaders and parties. This inspired and enlightened He Guoxiu's will to resist.

    The Chiang Kai-shek gang's oppression of the Mosuo people was very severe. The village was plagued by conscription, grain requisition, and disturbances that left the people in a state of unrest. Her cousin encouraged He Guoxiu, saying that to turn over, she must stand up and participate in the struggle. In February, she resolutely joined the "Minqing" (People's Youth League) led by the Communist Party at that time.

    Under the education and leadership of the "Minqing," He Guoxiu began her work. Among the sisters in the village, she used the opportunities of cutting grass on the hillside and weeding in the fields to carry out revolutionary propaganda work.

    As winter approached, they responded to the call from above to secretly make winter clothes for the People's Guerrilla. The capable and hardworking He Guoxiu and her sisters, working early and late, used the money earned from weaving bamboo hats and other items under the bean oil lamp and in the moonlight to buy cotton and cloth for sewing. Many women in the village were educated by them and were inspired by their active spirit, contributing their hard-earned savings to subsidize them and help them sew, quickly completing the task of sewing winter clothes for the People's Guerrilla. During the New Year, they also pushed and fried noodles and steamed rice cakes for the soldiers, comforting them. These efforts powerfully supported the struggle of the People's Guerrilla.

    In the spring of the following year, He Guoxiu led the masses to participate in the anti-three-requisition (conscription, grain requisition, taxation) struggle; on the "May Day" before the liberation of Lijiang County, He Guoxiu mobilized all the men, women, and children in the village, holding up sickles and hoes, to participate in the May Day demonstration in Lijiang County against Chiang Kai-shek. This made the working people realize their energy and increased their courage to fight.

    On "July 1st" of 1949, Lijiang County was peacefully liberated. The liberation of Lijiang County brought a new life to the Mosuo compatriots. They all greeted the joy of the liberation of the oppressed people for thousands of generations with active efforts in production and support for the front lines.

    After more than a year of struggle and testing, He Guoxiu gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Under the direct education of the Party, this good daughter of the Mosuo people showed an even more selfless and devoted spirit in her work.

    In the autumn, bandits attacked Lijiang from four directions.

    The seventy-person work-exchange team led by He Guoxiu carried out the four-grab movement of rushing to harvest, rush to plant, rush to thresh, and rush to hide. The peasants of the whole village harvested, planted, and threshed grain day and night, and hid all the harvests in the deep mountains, so that the enemy could not find a single grain. They couldn't even find a little flour to make paste for posting slogans. The bandit army only stayed for one night, unable to settle down, and ran away. The grain was not damaged, so when the autumn requisition work was launched, Xinwen Village completed its task ahead of schedule.

    In order to ensure the progress of production, He Guoxiu fully utilized the wisdom of the masses and widely solicited everyone's opinions. In March of this year, the youth of the whole village, led by the work-exchange team, spent two hundred workdays in five days to build the Chongjiang River dam. Willow and mulberry trees were planted beside the dam, and she actively promoted the sideline of women raising silkworms.

    Due to the influence of the great Han chauvinism of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, ethnic minorities were deprived of the opportunity to learn culture. He Guoxiu deeply felt the pain of illiteracy in her work. The only primary school in Xinwen Village was destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionary army before liberation. After liberation, He Guoxiu actively promoted the establishment of schools, and soon a junior primary school and a literacy class (night school) were established, mobilizing everyone to enroll. Now all school-age children in the village have enrolled. "Looking today, looking tomorrow, waiting for the sun to come out, following Chairman Mao, we will surely turn ourselves around," the song of love for Chairman Mao now resounds in Xinwen Village on the distant frontier.

    After He Guoxiu came to Beijing, she was respected everywhere. She excitedly wrote to the people of Lijiang about this situation. She said with emotion: "If it weren't for the Communist Party, how could our ethnic minorities have this day?" (Attached picture)

　　摩西族的好女儿
    ——记云南少数民族劳模和国秀
    吴元英
    在祖国的辽远边疆、滔滔的金沙江畔——云南丽江县新文村曾举行一个盛大的欢送会，欢送十九岁的摩西族姑娘和国秀去北京参加全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议。当和国秀走出村子的时候，所有摩西族的同胞瞧着常常露出微笑的和国秀的脸孔，拉着她的手恋恋不舍地说：“你能到北京去看毛主席，这不只是你一个人的光荣，是我们所有摩西族人的光荣啊！”丽江的人民在和国秀离开丽江的时候，特地托她带了一封信向毛主席致敬，并且嘱咐她：“把我们的话牢牢记住，见着毛主席时，详细说给他老人家听，摩西族的劳动人民以前受过好大的苦，现在有了他，我们翻身了。”
    和国秀，一个坚强的摩西族贫农的女儿。在旧社会，她和所有摩西族的兄弟姊妹们一样，一直过着非人的生活。当和国秀只有六、七岁的时候，就赤着脚上山放牛放马，她常常是一面追着牛马，一面跟在牛马后面嚎哭。
    那时候，她全家八口，老的老，小的小，租种着地主十一亩半地。白天黑夜辛苦劳动，打的粮食交了租子，就不够三、四个月吃。泛滥的金沙江和冲江河的河水，不是将庄稼淹坏，就是连根也被冲掉；但反动派和地主的掠夺，却并不因天灾而放松。和国秀在十三岁的时候，就负担了家中主要的劳动。白天在田里干活、上山砍柴、劈竹子；夜里，还得摸索着编笠帽、织草荐。背到来回有二天路程的市集，去换得粮食。她整年累月地刻苦劳动，虽获得全村的称道和美名，却并不能得到温饱。她不由得对生活发生了一连串的怀疑。
    一九四八年，云南的人民武装渐渐地发展起来。就在这一年的春天，和国秀从她表哥那里开始知道了：痛苦的生活，并不是命里带来的。假如每个人的劳动，除了养活自己，不需纳“奉献”给地主，衣食是可以维持的。主要因为自己的劳动养活了“蛀食虫”，人就没有了衣食。同时，她兴奋地知道了在我国的另外一些地方，那里已没有了地主的压迫和欺诈，有着伟大的人民革命的领袖和政党。这激励和启发了和国秀的反抗的意志。
    蒋匪帮对摩西人民的压迫是很利害的，村子里抓丁、征粮，骚扰得老百姓鸡犬不宁。表哥勉励着和国秀，要翻身，必须站起来参加斗争。二月里，她毅然加入了当时共产党所领导的“民青”。
    在“民青”的教育和领导下，和国秀开始了工作。她在村中的姊妹们中，利用在山坡割草、在田间锄地的机会，进行着革命宣传工作。
    在冬天快要来到的时候，她们响应了上级秘密为人民游击队做寒衣的号召。能干而耐劳的和国秀和她的姊妹们，用早起晚睡，在豆油灯下、在月光里编织笠帽等换得来的钱，买了棉花和布匹来缝制。村中好些妇女得到她们的教育，也为她们积极工作精神所感召，贡献出了自己的辛苦积蓄，补助给她们，帮助她们缝制，迅速地完成了为人民游击队缝制寒衣的任务。新年时，她们又为战士们推炒面，蒸粑粑，慰劳他们。这一些努力，有力地支援了人民游击队的斗争。
    第二年的春天，和国秀领导群众参加了反三征（征兵、征粮、征税）斗争；丽江县解放前夕的“五一”，和国秀动员了全村男女老小，举起镰刀和锄头，参加了丽江县的五一反抗蒋匪的示威大游行。使劳动人民认识到了自己的精力，提高了斗争勇气。
    一九四九年的“七一”，丽江县获得和平解放。丽江县的解放给摩西族同胞带来了新的生活。他们都以积极努力生产、支援前线来迎接这千百代被压迫人民翻身的喜悦。
    经过一年多斗争考验的和国秀，这时她光荣地参加了中国共产党，在党的直接教育下，更使这摩西族的好女儿表现出忘我工作的高尚品质。
    秋天，土匪从四路进攻丽江。
    和国秀领导的七十个人的变工队，进行着抢收、抢种、抢打、抢藏的四抢运动。全村的农民不分昼夜地收割、播种、打谷子，并且把收获物都隐蔽在深山里，使敌人搜索不到一颗粮食。甚至想打浆糊贴标语，都找不到一点面粉。匪军仅勾留了一夜，安身不住，就拔腿跑了。粮食没受损失，所以，在展开秋征工作时，新文村提早完成了任务。
    为了保障生产的进行，和国秀充分发挥了群众的智慧，广泛征集得大家的意见。在今年三月，以变工队为首的全村青壮年们，在五天内，花了二百个工，赶筑了冲江河堤。在堤旁植了柳树、桑树，她并积极提倡妇女养蚕的副业。
    由于蒋家匪帮的大汉族主义的影响，少数民族文化学习的机会受到剥夺。和国秀在工作中，深感不识字的痛苦，新文村仅有的一所小学，解放前被国民党反动军捣毁。解放后，和国秀积极宣传办学校，不久就成立了一所初级小学和一班识字班（夜校），动员大家入学。现在全村学龄儿童已全部入学。“今天望来明天望，望到老天出太阳，跟着毛主席，一定把身翻”，热爱毛主席的歌声，现在荡漾在辽远边陲的新文村。
    和国秀来到北京后，到处受人尊敬，她把这种情形兴奋地写给丽江的人民。她感动地说：“要没有共产党，我们少数民族那能会有这一天。”（附图片）
