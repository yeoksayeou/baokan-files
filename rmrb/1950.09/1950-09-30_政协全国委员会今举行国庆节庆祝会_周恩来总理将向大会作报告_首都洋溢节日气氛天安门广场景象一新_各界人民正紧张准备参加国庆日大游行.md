Xinhua News Agency, September 29th: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is scheduled to hold a National Day celebration meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the Central People's Government will deliver a report to the assembly, which will be broadcast by the Central People's Broadcasting Station. People's Broadcasting Stations across the country will rebroadcast simultaneously.

(Reported by our correspondent Bai Sheng) On the eve of the first National Day of the new China, the people's capital is presenting a thriving scene of the Chinese nation.

The Tiananmen Square, symbolizing the struggle and victory of the Chinese people, is welcoming the first National Day of the People's Republic of China with a brand new look. The Tiananmen Gate Tower overlooks the square, with the dazzling national emblem of the People's Republic of China embedded on the tower. A huge oil portrait of Chairman Mao is hung on the city gate. Two large banners are installed on the palace walls – "Long Live the People's Republic of China!" and "Long Live the Great Unity of the People of the World!" Four new grandstands have been built in front of Tiananmen to receive the leaders of the central government and various regions, model heroes and representatives, and foreign guests. The flagpole on the square has been painted silver-white, surrounded by white jade railings. On October 1st last year, when the People's Republic of China was founded, Chairman Mao personally used an electric flag-raising machine to raise the first national flag from this flagpole. Thirty-two red flags have been raised on the east and west sides of the square. The widened road in front of Tiananmen and the newly built tree-lined avenue are connected, which not only brings the parade closer to the rostrum, but also allows a horizontal formation of sixty people or four armored vehicles to pass simultaneously, allowing nearly 100,000 people to pass per hour. The conference has specially made two permanent 1,000-watt amplifiers so that the speeches from the Tiananmen rostrum can be heard on East and West Chang'an Avenue and Dongdan Square.

The outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people – outstanding combat heroes, labor models, these founders and builders of the country, have all converged in the people's capital on the eve of the National Day holiday. Excellent people's representatives from all ethnic groups of the People's Republic of China have also come from distant regions, carrying infinite joy, to participate in the grand ceremony. The outstanding youth representatives from all over the world have been visiting the people's capital of new China for several days and will celebrate the great National Day of the People's Republic of China with us. They have brought the celebrations and friendship of young people and people from all over the world.

The Capital "Preparatory Committee for Celebrating the National Day of the People's Republic of China" has decided to hold a grand military parade and celebration parade in Tiananmen People's Square during this carnival holiday. Hundreds of thousands of people, including the infantry, cavalry, artillery, tanks, air force, and navy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as workers, peasants, students, office workers, and citizens of the capital, will participate in this glorious and great celebration parade. On this day, the great ranks of the peace-loving Chinese people will show an irresistible force to the bellicose American imperialist aggressors.

The working class of the new China's capital is welcoming the first National Day with a high tide of production competition. The workers of the Beijing Tram Company Repair Factory are stepping up the decoration of the trams "People's", "Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China", and "National Day Anniversary", and ensuring that there will be National Day floats and light cars running on the streets of the capital on National Day. Under the leadership of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, 150,000 workers in the capital are preparing to participate in the grand celebration parade on National Day.

The emancipated peasants in the suburbs of Beijing are celebrating this year's great harvest with unparalleled joy. Every hardworking farmer is grateful to Chairman Mao for bringing them a good life and good times. On National Day, they are preparing to put on new clothes, take abundant agricultural products, and organize a team of 50,000 farmers to accept Chairman Mao's review.

The active youths in the capital's schools are joyfully holding grand parties with the outstanding youth representatives from various countries of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. Under the call of the Beijing Municipal Student Federation, 80,000 college and middle school students are preparing to participate in the National Day celebration parade.

The capital's literary and art circles have rushed out a large number of literary and artistic programs, which will be staged in major theaters in the capital before and after the festival as a gift to the first National Day of the new China. A cultural and artistic team of 5,000 people will also appear in the National Day parade.

The capital's department stores have also prepared a large number of gifts for the National Day holiday, which adds a festive atmosphere to the market.

In the capital on the eve of this National Day, a festive atmosphere is everywhere. The people of the new China's capital and the people of the whole country are welcoming this first National Day holiday with the national financial and economic situation beginning to improve. The people of the whole country will cheer for the victory of the people's motherland with the most joyful mood, wish the motherland a bright, happy, and beautiful future, and resolutely oppose the aggressive conspiracies and provocative acts of American imperialism, and defend peace in Asia and the world.
