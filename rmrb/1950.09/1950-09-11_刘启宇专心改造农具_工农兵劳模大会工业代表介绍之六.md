Liu Qiyu Focuses on Improving Farm Tools
    — Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, Part 6
    Liu Qiyu is the Deputy Technician of the Machinery Manufacturing Factory of the Hubei Mechanical Land Reclamation Office. In the past seven months of this year, he has improved and manufactured nine types of dry-land farm tools, from plowing to harvesting.
    Before Liberation, Intelligence Had Nowhere to Be Used
    When he was in school, he was determined to improve China's farm tools. He entered Hubei Agricultural College, where life was very hard. During the day, he attended classes, and at night, he repaired clocks and watches and engraved seals for others to support his family. No matter how life tormented him, his ambition to improve farm tools never wavered. However, after graduation, Liu Qiyu could not find a job where he could use his intelligence. Later, although he entered the Agricultural Rehabilitation Committee of the National Government Relief Administration to engage in farmland reclamation work, he always thought that he could realize his ideals. Therefore, he often suggested to the authorities of the committee his ideas for improving farm tools, but the answer he received was: "If we want to do it, we will ask the Americans to come. What can you do?"
    After Liberation, He Worked Selflessly
    After the liberation of Wuhan, Liu Qiyu's intelligence, which had been suppressed for many years, was brought into play. He had repaired and driven new-style tractors, investigated old-style farm tools in rural Hubei, and was familiar with the farming conditions in the hilly areas of the south. With the support of the leaders of the office, he excitedly began his farm tool manufacturing work. During the Spring Festival this year, when others went home for the New Year, he sat in the office for four days and nights, working hard to design an improved seeder. In March and April, in order to meet the plan for mass production of improved farm tools, he slept at one o'clock in the morning almost every day. Once, he did not sleep for nine days and nights in a row. Guo Jiesan, the chairman of the trade union, often came to urge him to rest in order to take care of his health. Every time Lao Guo came, he pretended to be asleep, and as soon as Lao Guo left, he got up and continued to work. He sometimes even forgot to eat for work. He said, "This is because my mind is liberated, and excitement and joy support me, and I never feel tired."
    Thanks to Liu Qiyu's painstaking research and joint research with his colleagues, single-blade light plows, double-blade light plows, animal-powered spring harrows, animal-powered disc harrows, five-row seeders, five-row strip-sowing dual-purpose machines, animal-powered five-tooth cultivators, animal-powered harvesters, dragon-bone waterwheels, and other nine kinds of farm tools were successively trial-produced. These farm tools have been tested and are mostly lightweight, durable, and suitable for cultivation in hilly areas. For example, the animal-powered disc harrow, which evenly breaks up the soil and can be controlled for depth, only requires one animal to pull it and can harrow twenty to twenty-five mu of land per day. At the Central and Southern China Industrial Exhibition held in Wuhan this year, these farm tools were loved by the majority of farmers, and farmer representatives gave Liu Qiyu many valuable suggestions and placed great hopes on the improvement of rural productivity. Liu Qiyu is now further designing and improving a series of new farm tools for paddy fields, such as plows, harrows, levelers, transplanters, and weeders.
    Closely Combined with Workers
    The main reason for Liu Qiyu's achievements is that he can closely combine with the workers. He values the wisdom of the masses and consults with his colleagues on everything. Before doing any work, he always finds the colleagues related to the work to discuss and study how to do it quickly and well. Then he summarizes everyone's opinions to achieve consensus and successfully complete the task.
    He is good at developing the talents of the masses and summing up the experience of the masses. Under his inspiration and encouragement, the workers have improved more than 20 kinds of tools, which played a decisive guarantee in completing production tasks.
    He and his colleagues organized a technical research group, which has achieved great results. The research group has no fixed form, and can be held at any time and place. Whether it is eating or taking a walk, they exchange work information and work experience with each other in groups of two or three in a heart-to-heart manner. In such discussions and studies, the workers are relaxed and happy in their minds, without any worries, and can discover and solve many problems. For example, the gear model on the seeder was drawn on the ground with stones by squatting with several workers. He pays close attention to every detail and every word of his colleagues, because a colleague's words, although very simple, are very practical and often the key to completing a machine. For example, once, in order to improve the clumsy method of tightening screws in the past, he initially designed a mold, but the workers disagreed, believing that the screws could not be taken out in this way. Later, he discussed it with everyone, and after thinking about it, everyone had no solution. After a while, a forging assistant standing next to him said, "It's easy, just peel it like a peanut." Inspired by this sentence, the mold was made into two halves combined, with a sleeve added to the outside to hold the mold, and after tightening, the mold was separated and the screw came out. After completion, the work efficiency was increased tenfold.

　　刘启宇专心改造农具
    —工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之六
    刘启宇是湖北机械农垦处机器制造工厂副技师。在今年七个月中，他改良并制造了从翻土到收割用的旱田农具有九种之多。
    解放前智能无处发挥
    在学校读书时，他就一心要改良中国的农具。他进入湖北农学院，那时生活很苦。白天上课，晚上给人家修钟表、刻图章，来养活一家人。不管生活怎样折磨，他改良农具的志向却始终没有动摇。但毕业后，刘启宇却找不到能发挥他智能的工作。后来虽然进了国民政府救济总署农业复员委员会搞农田复耕工作。总以为这下子可以实现理想了，于是经常把改进农具的意见，向该会当局建议，但所得到的回答是：“要搞，请美国人来，你能干什么？”
    解放后为工作废寝忘食
    武汉解放以后，刘启宇多年被压抑的智能才得到发挥。他曾经修理和驾驶过新式拖拉机，又调查过湖北农村的旧式农具和熟悉南方山陵地带的耕作情形，在该处领导的赞助下，他兴奋地开始了自己的农具制造工作。今年春节时，别人都回家过年去了，他一个人整整四昼夜坐在办公室里，为设计改良播种机而刻苦努力。三四月间，厂里为了迎接大量制造改良农具的计划，他差不多每天午夜一点钟才睡，有一次竟一连九天九夜没有睡觉。工会主任郭杰三为了照顾他的健康，时常来催促他休息，每当老郭一来，他就装睡，老郭一走，他又爬起来继续工作。为了工作，有时连饭也忘记了吃，他说：“这是因为我思想解放了，兴奋、愉快在支持着我，从不感到疲劳。”
    由于刘启宇的苦心钻研及和工友们共同研究的结果，接连不断地试制出了单边轻便犁、双边轻便犁、畜力弹簧耙、畜力圆盘耙、五行播种机、五行条播两用机、畜力五齿中耕除草机、畜力收割机、龙骨水车等九种农具。这些农具经过试验，大多轻便、耐用，适合在山陵地耕作。如畜力圆盘耙，碎土均匀，可以操纵深浅，只需一头牲口拉动，每天可耙地二十至二十五亩。在今年武汉市举行的中南区工业展览会上，这些农具受到广大农民的热爱，农民代表们并给刘启宇提了很多宝贵意见，对农村生产力的提高寄予很大希望。刘启宇现正进一步设计和改良水田用的犁、耙、平土器、插秧器、除草器等一系列新农具。
    和工人紧密结合
    刘启宇获得成就的主要原因，是他能和工人紧密结合。他看重群众的智慧，遇事和工友商量，在每做一件工作之前，他总把有关这个工作的工友，找来商量研究，怎样做得快，做得好，然后他再总结大家的意见，使大家的思想取得一致，任务得以胜利完成。
    他善于发挥群众的才能，善于总结群众的经验。在他的启发和鼓励之下，工友们一共改良了二十几种工具，在完成生产任务上，起了决定的保证作用。
    他和工友们组织了一个技术研究小组，收到很大的成效。研究小组没有一定的形式，任何时间、地点都可以举行。无论是在吃饭或散步，三三两两，用谈心的方式，相互交换工作情况和工作经验。像这样的讨论研究，工友们思想上轻松愉快，没有什么顾虑，可以发现和解决很多问题：如播种机上的齿轮模型，就是和几个工人蹲在地上，用石头画出来的。他非常注意工友们的每一个细节和每一句话，因为工友们的一句话，虽然很简单，但很实际，往往是完成一部机器的重要关键。例如有一次他为了改进过去打螺丝的笨拙方法，起初他设计了一个模子，但工友都不同意，认为这样打螺丝拿不出来。后来又和大家商量，想来想去，大家都没有办法，过了一会，站在旁边的一个锻工助手说了一句：“这还不容易，像剥花生一样的一剥就行了。”根据这句话的启示，将模具用两半合成，外面加一个套子，将模子套着，打好后再把模子分开，螺丝便出来了。做成后使工作效率提高了十倍。
