　　Shanxi Dingxiang County Government
    Disregards Proposals from People's Representatives of All Circles
    Standing Committee of the People's Congress Criticizes the Government
    [This newspaper dispatch] This month, on the 2nd and 3rd, the Third Session of the People's Representatives Conference of All Circles of Dingxiang County, Shanxi Province, held an expanded Standing Committee meeting. In addition to the Standing Committee members, 21 people, including representatives of farmers and business circles, as well as section chiefs of the government, attended. The meeting listened to the government's report on the handling of proposals from the first, second, and third sessions, and conducted discussions and inspections. The government's report on the handling of proposals from the first, second, and third sessions revealed that the county government paid very little attention to the proposals from the representative meetings. The proposals from the first session and the answers to the proposals could not be found; the proposals and answers from the second session were scattered aside; and the proposals from the third session related to the Culture and Education Section were lost by Zhang Jianying, the supervisor of the section. The government did not explain the implementation of the proposals from the first and second sessions; what the proposals related to civil affairs, justice, and other sections were, none of the sections knew. As for handling them in a planned and step-by-step manner, it was out of the question. Before this meeting, the government had never paid attention to checking and correcting these situations, but had always adopted a laissez-faire attitude. Of the 168 proposals from the third session, although more attention was paid to handling them than the previous two sessions, only 23 had been processed in the past month, in addition to the 25 that were answered face-to-face at the meeting. Fifty-eight were being processed, while 62 had not yet been processed. At this expanded Standing Committee meeting, a heated discussion and criticism was launched regarding the serious situation of the government's disregard for mass proposals. Farmer representatives and business representatives successively criticized the government. They said: "Losing the proposals is a manifestation of the government's irresponsibility to the people's cause and should be thoroughly reviewed." During the discussion, the government also conducted a profound self-criticism. Xing Fulin of the Water Conservancy Committee said in his review: "In the past, I only paid attention to the tasks assigned by the higher-level government, fearing punishment if I didn't handle them; but I thought that the problems raised by the masses were not important, and that it didn't matter if I didn't handle them." The review and criticism at this meeting will be of great help in improving the government's work in the future. Everyone agreed that this meeting was very good. In the past, the Standing Committee meetings were just a few people reporting on the work of the government, and there was no inspection of how the proposals of the representative meetings were handled. Government cadres unanimously stated: "In the future, we must strengthen our mass perspective, accept the opinions of the people, and do our work well."
    Finally, it was unanimously agreed to request the government to promptly handle the proposals from the first and second sessions, and to criticize the government. Regarding the loss of the proposals from the third session by the Culture and Education Section, it was suggested that the government investigate the responsibility and impose appropriate punishment.

　　山西定襄县政府
    漠视各界人民代表会议提案
    人代会常委会对政府提出批评
    【本报讯】本月二、三两日，山西定襄县三届各界人民代表会议召开扩大常委会，除常委出席外，并有农民、商界代表及政府科长等二十一人列席。会议听取了政府关于第一、二、三届会议提案处理情形的报告，并进行讨论和检查。在政府关于一、二、三届会议提案处理情况报告中，暴露了该县政府对代表会议的提案极不重视。一届会议的提案及对提案的解答竟找不见；二届会议提案及解答随便散放一旁；三届会议有关文教科办理的提案又为该科督学张建英遗失。政府对一、二届会议提案的执行情形毫无交代；有关民政、司法等科的提案是些什么，各科都弄不清，至于有计划有步骤的去办理则根本谈不到。此次会前政府对这些情况从未注意检查纠正，而一直是采取了放任自流的态度。三届会议一百六十八件提案，虽比前两届提案较注意办理了，但一个月来除会上当面解答了二十五件外，已处理的只二十三件，正办理的五十八件，而尚未办理的即有六十二件。此次扩大常委会上，对政府这样漠视群众提案的严重情形展开了热烈的讨论与批评。农民代表及商界代表均先后对政府提出批评。他们说：“丢了提案，这是政府对人民事业不负责任的表现，应该很好检讨。”讨论当中政府亦进行了深刻的自我批评。水利委员会邢富林在检讨中说：“过去我只是对上级政府所给的任务重视，不办理怕上级处分；但对群众提出来的问题认为不重要，认为不办理也不要紧。”经过此次会议的检讨与批评，对改进政府今后的工作是个很大的帮助。大家一致认为这次会议开得很好。以前的常委会只是少数人报告一下政府的工作情况，对代表会议的提案如何处理均没有检查。政府干部一致表示：“今后一定要加强群众观点，接受人民意见，把工作做好。”
    最后一致通过请政府将一、二两届会议提案抓紧办理，并对政府提出批评，对文教科遗失三届代表会议提案，建议政府查明责任，予以适当处分。
