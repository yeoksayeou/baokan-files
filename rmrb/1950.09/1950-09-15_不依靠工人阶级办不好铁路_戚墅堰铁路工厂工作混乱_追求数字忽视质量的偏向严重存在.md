It is Impossible to Run the Railways Well Without Relying on the Working Class
Chaos in the Qishuyan Railway Factory
Serious Tendency to Pursue Numbers and Neglect Quality Exists

[Our Newspaper News] Special Correspondent Lu Gong reports: Bureaucratic work styles exist among the leadership of the Qishuyan Railway Factory in Southern Jiangsu. Their understanding of the principle of "relying on the working class to run the people's enterprises well" is vague, leading to a tendency of "pursuing quantity and neglecting quality" in the factory, seriously damaging labor power. Since its liberation on April 26 last year, the Qishuyan Railway Factory has achieved great success in repairing the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, resisting bombing, and combating floods. In the first half of this year, it also overfulfilled the production tasks set by the ministry and the bureau. After the factory-wide workers' congress was held in May, half of the production units in the factory established management committees in June and July. In August, a factory-wide management committee was also established. The old structure is being changed, and the new system is being gradually established. However, examining the implementation of the principle of "relying on the working class to improve production," serious problems still exist. The party, government, labor union, and youth league leadership of the factory have now paid attention to this and have begun to mobilize the masses to conduct in-depth self-criticism during the rectification campaign.

I. Single-Minded Task Viewpoint, Seriously Damaging Labor Power

The factory overfulfilled the production tasks set by the Ministry of Railways and the Administration Bureau in the first half of the year. Taking June as an example, the repair of locomotives (calculated as major repairs) completed 117% of the ministry's task and 111% of the bureau's plan; the repair of passenger and freight cars also greatly exceeded the tasks. However, in the production process, overtime work and neglect of labor protection were very serious. In June, overtime reached 14,679 hours, an average of 5.3 hours per person; in July, overtime increased to 23,286 hours, an average of 7.6 hours per person. Why is there so much overtime? The objective reasons are that the vehicles to be repaired cannot enter the factory on time, forming a tight schedule at the end; the materials are not prepared sufficiently after the plan is set, and material shortages occur frequently; the cars transferred from other railway bureaus for repair often do not have drawings and need to be drawn temporarily. However, the main reason is that the leadership has not correctly studied and organized the productive forces. Taking June as an example, the factory should have worked 69,712 hours of overtime according to the task calculation, but only actually worked 14,679 hours. This shows that if the factory can correctly calculate and rationally organize production capacity, it can avoid overtime.

Due to overtime and neglect of safety and hygiene work, in July, 36% of the factory's 3,249 workers were on sick leave. In the factory's forging workshop, due to poor ventilation equipment, lung disease accounted for 30% of the workers. The sewers in the workshops are blocked, and toilets and garbage are not cleaned. This shows that the leadership only requires workers to overfulfill tasks but pays little or no attention to the workers' health.

II. Pursuing Quantity Neglecting Quality

In February of this year, the scrap rate of steel in the factory's sand casting workshop was 13.2%, the scrap rate of iron was 21.8%, and the scrap rate of copper was 21%. By July, the scrap rate of steel was 34.2%, the scrap rate of iron was 24.9%, and the scrap rate of copper was 23.4%. The quality has generally declined. In the four, five, and six months, of the 480 cast steel wheels poured, 124 could not be used. According to the cost calculation, it costs 2 million yuan to make one wheel, with a total loss of 248 million yuan. What is the reason? Because to increase production, the electric steel melting furnace was changed from two shifts to three shifts, producing one to two more furnaces per day. However, the allocation of technical personnel became difficult, and no one was specifically responsible for casting during the night shift. Because of the rush to meet the numbers, there was a lack of technical research, the composition of sand in the mold was impure, containing one-third mountain soil, which could not withstand the high heat of molten steel, causing the cast product to have more sand holes. The composition of the mud in the ladles was not good, and the mud melted together with the molten steel during casting, causing slag inclusions on the surface of the cast product. More importantly, Lu and Sun, the directors of the workshop, had a very poor understanding of the workshop situation. They did not even know how many workers there were in the workshop. He believed that the workers had low capabilities and rarely consulted with the workers on production issues. He only talked to the foremen about major and minor matters and lacked research on the problems that might occur and are likely to occur in the work. Zhang Guanfu, an inspector from the inspection section, inspected eight cast steel wheels one day and found that seven did not meet the standards. He raised this to Director Lu. Director Lu did not study or check the reasons for the problems, nor did he report them to the factory leadership in a timely manner. He believed that as long as some of the cast steel wheels could be used and the task could be completed, it would be fine.

III. Responsibility System, Rationalization Proposals, and New Record Movement Become a Mere Formality

The factory's responsibility system has not been implemented. After the Ministry of Railways deployed the implementation of the locomotive responsible system in August last year, the factory's machinery and other workshops once implemented it, but the factory leadership did not know what the result was. The factory's administrative director, party branch secretary, and labor union chairman were not clear about what the responsible system was for. After the factory established a factory-wide rationalization proposal committee in late March this year, it once counted all the rationalization proposals submitted by the factory and issued a reward; after that, there was no follow-up. The rationalization proposal committee did not hold a meeting until mid-August. In April this year, the factory leadership called for carrying out the new record movement. Until now, the leadership does not know how many new records the factory has created. These phenomena show that the factory does not attach importance to the wisdom and initiative of the working class.

IV. Serious Bureaucracy

How is the work of the factory's party, government, labor union, and youth league done? The administration has never held joint meetings with the party, labor union, and youth league to arrange production tasks. Therefore, the party, government, labor union, and youth league cannot unify their steps and concentrate their efforts to complete the production tasks. In May, the administration arranged a production competition, the political department arranged for the party to be open, the labor union arranged for the workers' congress, and the youth league prepared to sign apprentice contracts. No one cooperated, and each did their own thing. Director Wang of the political department did not clearly understand the role of the party in guaranteeing and supervising production, and denied the factory director's responsibility system. The factory director, Fang, was busy with meetings, working 14 hours a day, but still could not finish the work. He could not take care of the specific guidance and inspection of the work that was deployed. A production plan, from the factory director's office to the various workshops, some held a foreman's meeting to arrange it, and some held a joint meeting of the party, government, labor union, and youth league to arrange it, but did not really mobilize the workers to discuss it before posting the production plan on the blackboard. Since the labor union proposed the policy of facing production in March this year, the problem of how to face production has not been completely resolved, and a tendency to neglect workers' welfare has emerged. For example, in April, May, and June, some workshops arbitrarily worked overtime, ignoring the workers' health. There were more than 300 work-related injuries and illnesses every day, but the labor union did not promptly propose ways to correct them. The labor union chairman held an average of three meetings a day, sometimes even five meetings, and could not go deep into the field to organize and lead the production competition.

V. Misuse of the Management Committee

The Shanghai Railway Bureau proposed the policy of democratic management in March this year, and the bureau's party committee made a decision in April. The factory also generally held workers' congresses in May. The worker representatives raised 497 opinions to the administrative leadership and 280 opinions to the labor union. In July, various workshops began to establish management committees one after another, and the factory-wide management committee was also established on August 4. However, they generally have incorrect views and practices on the nature and tasks of the management committee. Of the 21 members of the factory-wide management committee, only one is a direct production worker and two are foremen. The locomotive workshop only opened the management committee during the shock tasks. Their management committee only makes decisions and does not convey them to the workers, nor does it solicit workers' opinions before the meeting. The wrought iron workshop passes everything through the management committee, holding a meeting every three days. The passenger car workshop management committee has the members take turns as chairman, not the workshop director as the chairman of the management committee. Many members believe that the factory director's final decision-making power is undemocratic.

　　不依靠工人阶级办不好铁路
    戚墅堰铁路工厂工作混乱
    追求数字忽视质量的偏向严重存在
    【本报讯】特约通讯员路工报道：苏南戚墅堰铁路工厂领导上存在着官僚主义作风，对于“依靠工人阶级办好人民企业”的方针认识模糊，致使该厂发生“追求数量，忽视质量”的偏向，严重损害劳动力。戚墅堰铁路工厂，自去年四月二十六日解放以来，在抢修沪宁路、反轰炸、反水灾等工作中获得很大成绩，今年上半年又超额完成了部订局订生产任务。五月份召开全厂工代会之后，六、七月间全厂有半数的生产单位成立了管委会，八月又建立了全厂管委会，旧的机构正在改变，新的制度正在逐步建立中。但就执行“依靠工人阶级，搞好生产”的方针来检查，还存在着严重的问题。该厂党、政、工、团的领导现已引起重视，并开始动员群众，在整风中作深入检查。
    一、单纯任务观点，严重损害劳动力
    该厂上半年超额完成了铁道部和管理局订的生产任务。以六月份为例，修理机车（折合大修计算）完成部定任务百分之一一七，完成局定计划百分之一一一；客货车修理方面也都大大超过了任务。但在生产过程中，加班加点，伤害劳动力的现象是很严重的。六月份加班达一四、六七九时，平均每人加班五·三时；七月份加班更升至二三、二八六时，平均每人加班七·六时。为什么加班加点呢？其客观原因是修理的车辆不能按时进厂，形成前松后紧；计划定出后，材料准备不够，经常发生待料现象；从其他路局调厂修理的车子，往往没有图样，需要临时绘制。但主要原因是领导上没有正确的研究和组织生产力。以六月份为例，该厂按照任务计算工时，应加班六九、七一二时，实际仅加班一四、六七九时。由此可见该厂如能正确计算合理组织生产能力，是可以避免加班加点的。
    由于加班加点和忽视安全卫生工作，七月份该厂三、二四九名工人中病假人数占百分之三十六。该厂锻工厂由于通风设备太坏，生肺病的占百分之三十。工房里阴沟不通，厕所、垃圾都不清扫。这说明领导上只要求工人超额完成任务，对于工人健康却不关心或很少关心。
    二、追求数量忽视质量
    今年二月，该厂翻沙工场钢的废品占百分之一三·二，铁的废品占百分之二一·八，铜的废品占百分之二一。到七月份，钢的废品占百分之三四·二，铁的废品占百分之二四·九，铜的废品占二三·四，质量普遍降低了。四、五、六三个月内浇的四百八十只铸钢轮，有一百二十四只不能用，按成本计算，制一只需要二百万元，共损失二亿四千八百万元。原因是什么呢？因为要提高产量，电气溶钢炉由二班改为三班，每天多出一炉到二炉，但是技术人员调配发生了困难，夜班浇铸时无专人负责。因为急着赶数字，缺乏技术研究，模型中砂的成份不纯，含有三分之一山土，不能耐钢水的高热，使铸品砂眼增多。包子内火泥的成份不好，浇铸时火泥跟着钢水一齐溶下来，使铸品面上发生了夹渣等毛病。更重要的原因是该工场主任卢和孙，平时对工场情况了解很差，连全场工人有多少还不知道，他认为工人能力低，很少和工人商量生产问题，大小事召集领班一谈就算，对工作中可能发生的问题与易发生的问题缺乏研究。检工科检工员张关富，有一天检查了八只铸钢轮，发现有七只不合标准，曾向卢主任提出来，卢主任不研究不检查产生毛病的原因，也没有及时向该厂领导上反映，他认为浇出来的钢轮，只要有一部分能用，能完成任务就好了。
    三、负责制、合理化建议、新纪录运动流于形式
    该厂负责制没有推行。去年八月铁道部布置实行机务负责制以后，该厂机械等工场曾一度推行，但结果如何，该厂领导上竟不知道。该厂行政主任、党支书、工会主席对于负责制到底是为什么？都不清楚。今年三月下旬，该厂成立全厂合理化建议委员会以后，统计过一次全厂所提出的合理化建议，并发过一回奖；此后，就再无下文了。一直到八月中旬合理化建议委员会才开了一次会。今年四月该厂领导上号召开展创造新纪录运动，直到现在全厂究竟创造了多少新纪录，领导上也不知道。这些现象说明该厂不重视工人阶级的智慧和积极性的发挥。
    四、严重的官僚主义
    该厂党、政、工、团工作怎样做呢？行政上布置生产任务，从来没有和党、工、团共同开会研究过，因此党、政、工、团就不可能统一步调，集中力量去完成生产任务。五月份行政上布置生产竞赛，政治处布置党公开，工会布置工代会，青年团准备订师徒合同，谁也不配合，各闹一套。政治处汪主任对于党在生产中如何起保证、监督的作用认识不清，否认了厂长负责制。该厂方厂长则忙于开会，每天工作十四点钟，工作还是处理不完。对布置下去的工作，也就顾不得具体指导和检查。一个生产计划，从厂长办公室到各工场后，有的召开领班会议布置一下，有的召开党、政、工、团联系会布置一下，并没有真正发动工人讨论，就把生产计划贴在黑板报上了。工会自今年三月提出面向生产的方针后，但怎样面向生产的问题还没有得到彻底解决，却又产生了忽视工人福利的偏向。如四、五、六月间，有些工场任意加班加点，不顾工人健康，每天公伤、疾病达三百多人，工会也未及时提出设法纠正。工会主席每天平均开三次会，有时甚至开五次会，不能深入现场，组织与领导生产竞赛。
    五、管委会运用不当
    上海路局在今年三月即已提出民主管理的方针，四月份路局党委做了决定。该厂在五月份内也普遍召开了工代会，工人代表对行政领导上提出了四百九十七条意见，对工会提出二百八十条意见。七月开始，各场先后建立管委会，全厂管委会也在八月四日建立。但他们对管委会的性质和任务，还普遍存在错误的看法和做法。全厂管委会二十一位委员中，只有一个直接生产的工人，两个领班。机车工场在突击任务时，才开管委会，他们的管委会只做决定，不向工人传达，开会前也不征求工人意见。锻铁工场是大小事都通过管委会，三天要开一次会。客车工场管委会是由委员轮流当主席，不以工场主任为管委会主任委员，很多委员对厂长最后决定权认为是不民主。
