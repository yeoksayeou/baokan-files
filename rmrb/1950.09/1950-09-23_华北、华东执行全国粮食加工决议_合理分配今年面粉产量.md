　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th. The flour industries in North and East China have held grain processing conferences and flour processing conferences respectively, according to the national flour production and sales balance plan formulated by the National Grain Processing Conference, and have allocated the flour production volume of various regions in the two regions for this year (from June this year to May next year). The allocation of output in the two regions was carried out in accordance with the spirit stipulated by the National Grain Processing Conference, which gave appropriate consideration to regions with lower operating rates. The output of North China, which had a higher operating rate last year, is 17 million bags this year, accounting for 64.6 percent of the actual operating number in the region, a decrease of 7.3 percent compared with last year; the output of East China (excluding Shandong), which had a lower operating rate last year, is more than 18,928,000 bags this year, accounting for 32.6 percent of the actual operating number in the region, an increase of 2.8 percent compared with last year. Of the output of the two regions to be processed by the grain company, 7 million bags are from North China and 6.7 million bags are from East China. The two regions have decided that this part of the commissioned processing will be allocated by the grain companies in each region in appropriate proportions according to business operation needs and local production capacity. East China also extracted 3.2 million bags from the commissioned processing part to focus on taking care of the difficulties of factories in various provinces and cities. The self-operated part in East China is allocated according to the supply of raw materials, the sales of finished products, and the capital turnover capacity of each factory.
    In terms of sales, East China has specifically stipulated the scope of foreign sales for various regions and allocated the sales volume according to the needs of various regions and the historical situation of the sales market of each factory; North China has decided that the flour produced in various regions of the region and the flour transported from other regions to the region can be freely transported and sold within the region this year.
    In addition, the two regions have also resolved the issue of the standard of grain processing fees left to the major administrative regions to resolve by the National Grain Processing Conference.

　　华北、华东执行全国粮食加工决议
    合理分配今年面粉产量
    【新华社二十日讯】华北、华东两区面粉工业根据全国粮食加工会议订定的全国面粉产销平衡计划，已分别召开了粮食加工会议和面粉加工会议，分配了两区各地本年度（今年六月至明年五月）的面粉生产量。两区产量的分配，是按照全国粮食加工会议规定的，开工率较大的地区适当照顾开工率较低的地区的精神进行的。去年度开工率较高的华北区本年度产量为一千七百万袋，占该区实际开工数的百分之六十四点六，较去年度减少了百分之七点三；去年度开工率较低的华东区（山东除外）今年度产量为一千八百九十二万八千余袋，占该区实际开工数的百分之三十二点六，较去年度增加了百分之二点八。两区产量中将由粮食公司委托加工的，华北区为七百万袋；华东区为六百七十万袋。此项委托加工部分，两区都决定由各该区粮食公司按业务经营需要和各地生产能力，作适当比例分配。华东区并在委托加工部分中抽出三百二十万袋，按各省、市区各厂困难情况作重点照顾。自营部分，华东区系按照各地原料供应和成品销售情况以及各厂资金周转能力分配的。
    销售方面，华东区根据各地需要以及各厂销售市场的历史情况，具体规定了各地外销的范围，并分配了销售数量；华北区则决定本年度本区各地所产面粉和外区运销本区面粉均可在区内自由运销。
    此外，两区对全国粮食加工会议留给各大行政区解决的粮食加工费的标准问题，亦作了解决。
