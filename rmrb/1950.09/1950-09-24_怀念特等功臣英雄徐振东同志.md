　　Remembering Comrade Xu Zhendong, Special-Class Hero
　　Zhong Kai
　　Comrade Xu Zhendong, Deputy Company Commander of the Seventh Company, Third Battalion, 420th Regiment, 140th Division, a special-class hero, gloriously sacrificed himself in the Yichang Campaign of the Yangtze River Crossing in 1949. His name, like a bright banner, is forever erected in the hearts of the soldiers.
　　Xu Zhendong was from Yushu County, Jilin Province, Northeast China. He suffered from the exploitation and oppression of landlords from a young age. He joined the People's Liberation Army in the summer of 1946 and joined the Party in August 1947. He was awarded five major merits (the Liaoxi merit has not yet been assessed). He had gains in every battle. In the Battle of Wu'erhan Fort in Liaoxi alone, he captured 201 Kuomintang bandit soldiers, seized 46 rifles, 5 light machine guns, 1 heavy machine gun, 1 60mm mortar, 15 submachine guns, 1 carbine, 1 pistol, 2 radios, and 1 telescope. He participated in twelve major battles and shot down 89 enemies with superb shooting skills. He was a model of an excellent commander and combatant with both wisdom and courage. He showed his shooting skills from the beginning when he participated in the battle of Siping (Three Raids South of the Songhua River in Northeast China). In the Battle of Bajiazi, when he fought the enemy's New First Army for the first time, he killed 16 enemies. In the Battle of Wu'erhan Fort, he once killed two enemies with one shot. Under the cultivation of Comrade Xu Zhendong, his platoon produced more than a dozen super shooters.
　　In the Battle of Wu'erhan Fort, our unit was tasked with cooperating with friendly forces to annihilate the enemy's only mobile force, the two divisions of the New Fifth Army. At dawn on January 5, 1948, the troops had just arrived at Wu'erhan Fort and had not yet built fortifications, when the encounter blocking battle began. The enemy pounced on us along the Liao River line with intensive firepower, and the snowy hills of Wu'erhan Fort turned into scorched black. The soldiers stubbornly resisted, and enemy battalions fell one after another during the charge. Our army also suffered heavy casualties, and the Ninth Company had successively changed four company commanders. At four o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy broke into the Ninth Company's position at Wu'erhan Fort, and the flanks of the Seventh Company and the machine gun company were exposed and severely threatened. If Wu'erhan Fort was breached by the enemy, the entire blocking battle would be defeated.
　　The enemy rushed like a pack of mad dogs to the commanding height of the entire Third Battalion—the small hill in the middle of Wu'erhan Fort—thirty or forty meters away. Our army had to counterattack from the flank of the Seventh Company to seize the commanding height. This was a critical moment. Xu Zhendong jumped in front of the instructor and said, "I am a Communist Party member, I will go!" A narrow path from their position to the hilltop was blocked by enemy fire. Xu Zhendong first braved the rain of bullets to run to the hilltop to look at the terrain, and then urgently called the soldiers to charge up. The road was narrow and the snow was slippery, and the enemy frantically blocked the road. Tian Ruicheng, the squad leader who rushed to the front of the first squad, and soldiers Tian He and others gloriously sacrificed themselves. At this critical moment, Xu Zhendong stood up on the hilltop where bullets were flying, encouraging the soldiers. The soldiers climbed over the bodies of martyrs Tian Ruicheng and Tian He, rushed to the top of the hill, and occupied the commanding height. Our army's machine guns roared, and the enemy who had climbed up the hillside rolled and crawled back. Although Xu Zhendong's platoon suffered more than a dozen casualties on this small hill, they always stood like a huge steel barrier, blocking the gap in the position and consolidating the entire blocking battle line.

　　怀念特等功臣英雄徐振东同志
    钟恺
    一四○师四二○团三营七连副连长，特等功臣英雄徐振东同志，是在一九四九年我军强渡长江的宜昌战役里光荣牺牲的。他的名字像一面鲜明的旗帜，永远树立在战士们的心中。
    徐振东是东北吉林省榆树县人，从小受尽了地主的剥削压迫，一九四六年夏天参加了人民解放军，一九四七年八月入党。他前后立了五次大功（还有辽西功没评）。他每次战斗都有缴获，仅辽西大战吴尔汗堡子一役中，一个人就俘虏了两百零一个国民党匪军，缴了四十六支步枪、五挺轻机枪、一挺重机枪、一门六○炮、十五支冲锋枪、一支卡宾枪、一支手枪、两部电台及一个望远镜。他参加过十二次大战斗，曾以高超的射击技术打倒了八十九个敌人。他是智勇兼备的优秀指挥员和战斗员的模范。他一开始参加三下江南（东北松花江南）的战斗，就显露了他的射击本领。在八家子战斗中第一次和敌人新一军作战时，他打死敌人十六个。在吴尔汗堡子战斗中，他曾有一枪打死了两个敌人。在徐振东同志的培养下，他那个排产生了十几个超等射手。
    在吴尔汗堡子战斗中，我部担任了配合友军、歼灭敌人仅有的机动兵力新五军两个师的堵击任务。一九四八年一月五日拂晓，部队刚到达吴尔汗堡子，还没构筑工事，遭遇性的阻击战就开始了。敌人以密集的火力沿着辽河线向我猛扑，吴尔汗堡子白雪皑皑的山头，都变成了焦黑的一片。战士们顽强地抗击着，冲锋的敌人一个营一个营地倒下去。我军的伤亡也大量增加，九连已接连换了四个连长。下午四时，敌人突进了吴尔汗堡子九连阵地，七连和机枪连的侧翼暴露了，受了严重的威胁。如果吴尔汗堡子被敌人突破了，整个阻击战就要受到失败。
    敌人像一群疯狗一样冲到了距三营全线的制高点——吴尔汗堡子中间的小山——三四十米处，我军必须从侧翼的七连反击，抢夺制高点。这是千钧一发的紧急关头。徐振东跳到教导员跟前说：“我是共产党员，我去！”从他们这里到山头的一条窄道，正被敌人火力封锁着，徐振东一个人先冒着弹雨跑到山头去看地形，接着便紧张地叫战士们冲上去。路窄雪滑，敌人又发疯似地封锁这条路。一班冲在顶前面的班长田瑞成、战士田和等光荣牺牲了。徐振东在这个紧急关头，挺身站立在子弹横飞的山头上，鼓舞着战士们。战士们爬过烈士田瑞成、田和的尸体，冲到了山顶，占据了制高点。我军机关枪叫开了，已经爬上山坡的敌人连滚带爬的缩了回去。徐振东一排人在这小山头上虽然伤亡了十几个人，但始终像一道巨大的钢铁屏障，堵住了这个阵地的缺口，巩固了整个阻击战线。
