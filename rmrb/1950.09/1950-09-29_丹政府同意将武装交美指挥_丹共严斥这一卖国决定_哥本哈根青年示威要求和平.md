Xinhua News Agency, September 27th dispatch: Comprehensive TASS news: After holding secret talks with the Social Democratic Party, the Conservative Party, and the Farmers' Party, the Danish government has agreed to the demands of US imperialism to organize a West German aggressive army and place the Danish armed forces under unified US command. In response, the Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party issued a statement on the 25th, sternly condemning this action by the government as a violation of the Danish constitution, meaning that Denmark is deprived of its own right and opportunity to decide on issues of war and peace. The Central Committee of the Danish Communist Party called on all honest Danes to unite and fight against military policies that violate Danish interests.
    Prior to this, the Chairman of the Danish Communist Party, Larsen, had, on behalf of the Danish Communist Party parliamentary group, requested Danish Prime Minister Hedtoft and other parliamentary groups of various parties to give a negative response to the unreasonable demands of the United States. At the same time, he requested that Parliament immediately discuss this major issue concerning Danish independence, and that the government should not make treacherous decisions in violation of the Constitution before Parliament has discussed it. However, the Hedtoft government ignored the opinions of the Danish Communist Party and secretly made a treacherous decision with the reactionary parties in Parliament. This action by the Hedtoft government has aroused great indignation among the Danish people. Youths in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, held a demonstration on September 24 for this reason. The flags and signs they held read: "Peace!" "Oppose the extension of military service!" "Reject the new demands of the United States!"

　　丹政府同意将武装交美指挥
    丹共严斥这一卖国决定
    哥本哈根青年示威要求和平
    【新华社二十七日讯】综合塔斯社消息：丹麦政府在和社会民主党、保守党与农民党三个资产阶级政党举行秘密谈判后，已同意美帝国主义关于组织西德侵略军队和将丹麦武装部队交由美国统一指挥的要求。丹麦共产党中央委员会为此于二十五日发表声明，严正斥责政府的此项行动违背丹麦宪法，它意味着剥夺了丹麦自己决定战争与和平问题的权利与机会。丹共中央委员会号召所有正直的丹麦人团结起来为反对违反丹麦利益的军事政策而斗争。
    在此以前，丹麦共产党主席拉荪即曾代表丹共议会党团向丹麦总理赫多夫及其他各党派议会党团，要求对美国的无理要求予以否定的答复。同时，并要求议会立即讨论这一攸关丹麦独立的重大问题，在议会未讨论前，政府不得违反宪法擅作决定。但是赫多夫政府竟对丹共的意见置之不理，而与议会内各反动党派秘密作出了卖国的决定。赫多夫政府此举已激起了丹麦人民的极大愤慨。丹麦首都哥本哈根的青年为此于九月二十四日举行了示威。他们高举的旗帜和标语牌上写着：“和平！”“反对延长兵役！”“拒绝美国的新要求！”
