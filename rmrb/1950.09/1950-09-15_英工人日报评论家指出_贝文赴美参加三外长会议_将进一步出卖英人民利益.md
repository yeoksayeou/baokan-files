Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th (TASS): The diplomatic commentator of the "Workers' Daily," Russell, stated: Bevin, who is going to Washington this week to attend the British, American, and French foreign ministers' conference, is carrying with him a plan to destroy the United Nations organization and further eliminate British independence.

The commentator said: The three foreign ministers will discuss: "First, mobilizing more people in European countries to realize the military plans of the United States. The British people who are now going to serve two years of military service will be among the first to be mobilized. The United States will emphasize MacArthur's demand to immediately send more British soldiers to Korea. Second, the plan to arm West Germany and establish a German army led by former Nazi generals under the guise of 'police.' Third, the possibility of Britain refusing to continue trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as a whole, which is of extreme importance to it."

    贝文赴美参加三外长会议  将进一步出卖英人民利益
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社伦敦十日讯：工人日报外交评论家鲁塞尔称：本周赴华盛顿参加英、美、法外长会议的贝文，已随身携带着整个破坏联合国组织和更进一步取消英国独立的计划。
    评论员说：三外长将讨论：“第一，为实现美国的军事计划而动员更多的欧洲各国人民。现在将要服两年兵役的英国人，将是首先被动员者之一。美国将强调麦克阿瑟所提立即派遣更多英国士兵到朝鲜去的要求。第二，武装西德和在‘警察’的伪装下建立一支由前纳粹将领所统率的德国陆军的计划。第三，英国拒绝继续进行对它有极端重要性的与苏联及整个东欧的贸易的可能性”。
