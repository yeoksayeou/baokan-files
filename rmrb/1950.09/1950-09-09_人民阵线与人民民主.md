　　The People's Front and People's Democracy
    Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States

    In the trial at Foley Square against our party and its leaders, we faced an accusation that we had conspired to teach and advocate the overthrow of the United States government by force and violence. To properly answer this false accusation, we must not only clarify the general principles of Marxism-Leninism and briefly describe the history of our party, but also point out the main lines of struggle for socialism in our own and other countries. In its defense, our party—which is essentially an attack on capitalism—developed a correct Marxist-Leninist line. In particular, we have placed the responsibility for the use of violence in the class struggle where it belongs, on the shoulders of the bourgeoisie and its government.

    Among the materials submitted to the court was a pamphlet of mine entitled "In Defense of the Communist Party and Its Accused Leaders." This pamphlet was unanimously agreed upon by the National Committee as the party's policy in the trial. In this pamphlet, to meet the urgent needs of the defense, I briefly summarized, in both theoretical and practical terms, the experience of the world's communist parties in the united front policy since the Seventh Congress of the Communist International in 1935, in addition to elaborating on the general policies of the Communist Party. In doing so, I analyzed the pre-war anti-fascist People's Front policy, the wartime national unity policy, and the post-war anti-imperialist People's Front policy and People's Democracy policy.

    Therefore, the scope of theory and strategy covered by this pamphlet is very broad. It involves all the complexities of the major world struggles of the past fifteen years. What made this work even more difficult was that many of the areas explored were quite new. By and large, the basic analysis unfolded in this pamphlet is correct. However, due to the breadth, complexity, and novelty of the subject matter, as well as the brief manner in which it was handled, the pamphlet naturally contained, and indeed does contain, certain errors and shortcomings. Of course, we all know that many European Communist leaders also made mistakes when they first analyzed parts of this general experience. In my opinion, the most serious shortcoming of my pamphlet is its final part, which discusses the policies of the Communist Party of the United States, regarding the strategy of the People's Front and some important points concerning the new People's Democratic states. Although the points themselves are fundamentally correct, they are described too briefly and lack clear and adequate elaboration. This makes these points easy to be misunderstood and distorted, and it also makes it necessary for us to fully develop the implications of all these things. As Comrade Dennis correctly pointed out at the National Committee in March 1950, there has been some misunderstanding or distortion within the party of the correct line of the party in the trial, making full development even more necessary. Therefore, I am now writing this article with a special purpose, to clarify and elaborate on some of the issues discussed during the trial, especially in my pamphlet.

    The Meaning of Fascism

    At the Seventh Congress of the Communist International in 1935, Comrade Dimitrov cleared away the then-prevalent social democratic fallacy, the gist of which was that fascism was a "rebellion of the middle class." Comrade Dimitrov correctly pointed out that the characteristic of fascism is "the open terrorist dictatorship of the most reactionary, most chauvinistic, and most imperialistic elements of finance capital." Dimitrov further said that fascism is "the result of the decline of the capitalist system." As the general crisis of capitalism deepens, the fascist movement becomes the inevitable resort of monopoly capital in its desperate struggle to prevent the victory of the working class. This is a fact that we must keep in mind in our work. It is very obvious that the big capitalists who, by reality—if not by theory—have understood that their social system is in serious crisis, have no intention of standing idly by and letting this system be shattered. Therefore, fascism, and its organized attempt to undermine democracy and socialism with a policy of civil war and world war, is essentially an effort by finance capital to overcome the general crisis of capitalism and at the same time to acquire total world hegemony for itself (specifically, for Wall Street).

    Fascism took root at the very beginning of the general crisis of capitalism. This can be clearly seen from the relentless attempts of the reactionary forces to crush the Russian Revolution from the outset, and from their relentless attempts to crush the workers' revolutionary struggles in Central Europe after the First World War. However, fascism only became a mode of rule when Mussolini seized Italy in 1922. In 1933, when Hitler seized Germany in the midst of the world economic crisis, fascism finally became a worldwide threat. During this general period, the big capitalists in France, Britain, the United States, and other capitalist countries were also infected with fascist ideas. Therefore, fascism is by no means simply a phenomenon of Germany, Italy, and Japan, although for special reasons it only came to power in the Axis countries. It represents the general trend of the world's largest capitalists in the face of the deepening crisis of capitalism and the growing socialism. The big financial capitalists in the Axis countries dreamed of a fascist world ruled by themselves, beginning with an all-out attack on the Soviet Union. But the resistance of the democratic forces of the peoples of various countries, the strength of the Soviet Union, and the sharp contradictions between the capitalist countries made it impossible for the Axis countries to carry out their planned offensive and build a fascist world on the ruins of world democracy and socialism. Experience has shown that fascism cannot eliminate inter-imperialist rivalries, but rather sharpens them.

    Therefore, one of the most fundamental things we must understand from all this is that the march towards war and fascism was not, is not, and is not now a temporary phenomenon of the big bourgeoisie. On the contrary, this is their basic direction (especially American imperialism), an attempt to overcome the general crisis of capitalism. This explains why the monopolists of all countries, under the aggressive leadership of Wall Street, are so eager to reorganize the fascist groups and movements that were defeated in the Second World War everywhere. Fascism was defeated in the war; but the trend of the imperialist bourgeoisie is to continue to move towards fascism. Fascism is still full of poison. To underestimate its danger would indeed be a serious mistake.

    Another important thing we must understand about fascism is that fascism has brought the monopoly capitalists a more highly conscious counter-revolutionary prospect, they still try to save that social system which is facing the ever deepening of the general crisis of capitalism, no matter how impossible it is. At the Seventh Congress, Dimitrov said the following in this general respect: "The ruling bourgeoisie is increasingly seeking salvation from fascism, the purpose of which is to formulate special methods of exploiting workers, preparing imperialist wars, attacking the Soviet Union, enslaving and dividing China, and preventing revolution by all these means."

    Before the development of the general crisis of capitalism—a crisis that on the one hand caused the growth of socialism and on the other hand led to the further decline of the capitalist system—the capitalists and their theorists had not encountered a sharp threat to their social system. However, the development of the general crisis of capitalism and the challenge of world socialism have violently shaken the monopoly capitalists. They were shocked to find that their system was in danger. Therefore, they consciously accepted the fascist prospect—despite how they concealed this prospect to avoid mass opposition. Naturally, this did not provide a clear vision for such a chaotic capitalist system. Nor did it avoid the most severe conflicts between imperialist countries; in fact, fascism exacerbated these conflicts. This conscious policy of advancing towards fascism makes it doubly vicious and a double threat, which we must clearly and constantly keep in mind.

    Anti-Fascist, Anti-War Movement

    Fascist rule is a relentless attack on the living standards, traditional freedoms, democratic organizations, national independence, and even the very existence of the peoples of the world. Therefore, the rampant pre-war fascism inevitably aroused a very broad and militant mass movement of resistance by the democratic forces. This broad movement absorbed workers, peasants, blacks, intellectuals, and small businessmen into its scope; this movement also bridged the ideological differences between Catholics, social democrats, liberals, communists, and non-party members—a vast array of democratic forces. These democratic strata and groups had never been so united before. They were all inspired by a determination to resist and defeat fascism, this new social plague—to prevent the establishment of a reign of terror and to prevent the world from being plunged into war. (⑴⑷)

    There are two basic characteristics of this great pre-war anti-fascist, anti-war movement that need to be explained. First, there was a large element of defensiveness in it. That is to say, the purpose of this movement was to preserve cherished democratic rights and democratic organizations from fascist attacks; but at the same time, this movement also contained enormous offensive potential—during and after the war, this potential would lead to major victories for the democratic people. The second basic characteristic of the anti-fascist, anti-war movement was its enormous political breadth. As has been said, the People's Front policy utilized all existing possibilities to allow workers of various ideological groups and the forces of various middle classes to stand shoulder to shoulder—despite many difficulties—against a common enemy.

    In this general aspect, one of the most important things we should now clearly remember is that if war and fascism are a threat in today's world situation—as they indeed are—then the people of all countries must develop a broad united front for the struggle for peace and against fascism. Because of the devastating defeat suffered by fascism in the war, and in view of the democratic developments in the post-war period, there has been a tendency to feel that the danger of fascism no longer exists, and therefore, that the need for an anti-fascist, anti-war People's Front has also disappeared. There are two main forces that have cultivated and exploited this mass illusion. First, American imperialism, in its pursuit of world hegemony, must first break through the alliance of broad anti-fascist democratic forces that had won the war. Second, the right-wing democratic socialists—the loyal servants of capitalism—implement this policy of division in order to combat the universal revolutionary sentiments of the working class. Therefore, these two forces, naturally with the help of the Vatican, deliberately split the anti-fascist alliance in the capitalist world, including the trade union movement. And they established the so-called "Third Force" movement. This movement, as has become clear later, is nothing more than an appendage of American imperialism, which paved the way for extreme reaction and fascism.

    But the "Third Force," although supported by the United States and other capitalist governments, the Vatican, and right-wing social democrats; although many workers have fallen into the trap of anti-Soviet rabble-rousers and imperialist illusions, can only be temporary. The fascism that is developing rapidly around the world and the growth of the new war crisis will inevitably lead the democratic masses who are still under the leadership of social democrats and other reactionaries to break with the idea of the entire "Third Force" and unite with the left-wing forces to jointly develop a strong anti-war and anti-fascist movement, which mainly follows the line of the People's Front, although such things will not happen automatically. Indeed, signs of the "Third Force" splitting are already evident. These signs can be exemplified by the recent strikes in France and Belgium. In these strikes, Catholic, socialist, and communist workers stood shoulder to shoulder against their "Third Force" governments and against the leaders of the social democrats and the Vatican. The main lesson to be learned from this is that the slogan of supporting the People's Front is still valid, although in the current new world situation, the main content of this slogan must be anti-imperialist and anti-war, and when we give this content all possible forms and changes to make it a slogan, we must be very flexible.

    The Policy of the People's Front

    The Communist International, at its Seventh Congress in 1935, under the leadership of Stalin and Dimitrov, grasped the significance of the new world situation caused by the rise of Nazi Germany and developed the policy of the People's Front to combat the threat of fascism and war. This was a remarkable theoretical and practical political achievement. The Congress recommended mobilizing all democratic strata to unite to fight against the enslavement of the masses and against a new world war, and this mobilization led to certain important policy and action changes. The Congress frankly and bravely adopted these changes. Dimitrov emphasized these changes in his famous report, saying: "Our Congress is a congress that defines a new direction in the strategy of the Communist International."

    The essence of the new direction in communist strategy is twofold: (1) to draw up a broad anti-fascist, anti-war program and organizational form, broad enough to include the powerful democratic masses who have been politically mobilized by the capitalist crisis and the threat of fascist war; (2) to stipulate that the Communist Party should participate in governments that are developed from the struggle against fascism and war under special circumstances. These new strategic ideas, it is not necessary to repeat, are fully in line with the principles of Marxism-Leninism.

    As Marx, Lenin, and Stalin taught us, political strategy and political tactics are not immutable, but must evolve to adapt to changing circumstances. Therefore, the strategy stipulated by the Seventh Congress, on the one hand, is still basically correct, and on the other hand, it has undergone some changes, growth, and development in the turbulent fifteen years that followed due to the fundamental changes in the world situation, which is not surprising at all. It would be ridiculous to think that it could not be that way. Among the many later developments that can be mentioned are: the line of national and international united solidarity followed during the war; the new policies applied in the establishment of the People's Democratic states in Eastern Europe after the war; the participation of the Communist Parties in the coalition governments of France and Italy; the victorious development of the great Chinese revolution—Stalin pointed out the main lines of this development twenty-four years ago. As the struggle for socialism progresses around the world, there will undoubtedly be other important tactical developments in the Communist Party's policies. What is mainly to be explained here is that all tactical (sometimes strategic) shifts in the past fifteen years are in line with the sound Marxist-Leninist line of that famous Seventh Congress of the Communist International.

    This reminds me of the question of the so-called "new road to socialism," which has been talked about a lot since the rise of the People's Democratic states in Eastern Europe after the war. For a period of time, there were some ambiguities in the theoretical analysis of these important issues, and the Communist Party leaders in the People's Democratic states also had this situation. Our party (including my writings) also showed this kind of inappropriate view in the analysis.

    In my pamphlet "In Defense of the Communist Party and Its Accused Leaders," I quoted a then-popular saying, "the new road to socialism" (since then, the parties of the People's Democratic states have refused to use that term), which I mentioned from a strategic point of view.

    Of course, the simple and accurate fact is that, strategically speaking, the strategies used by the workers in the People's Democratic states of Eastern Europe and the People's Republic of China in the process of realizing socialism are different from those of the Russian working class. And it had to be that way. If anyone wanted to apply rigid strategies in all these very different circumstances, they would be political fools, not Marxist-Leninists. These tactical changes are very important, and good or bad tactics, under certain circumstances, make the difference between victory or failure. However, in the process of class struggle, no matter what tactical changes must be taken, the road to socialism is the same—that is, to defeat the bourgeoisie and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    Spontaneity and Imbalanced Development

    Let me insert a few words here about the issue of "spontaneity" and "imbalanced development" in the class struggle. In the pamphlet I wrote, "In Defense of the Communist Party and Its Accused Leaders," I said that the world's great communist movement is "spontaneous" in that it has taken root in the unique national conditions of each individual country. I cited this obvious fact to refute the government's false accusation that these communist parties and the great people's movements they lead are artificial creations, the work of the "Soviet Fifth Column"—at this time, Browder, the self-proclaimed Marxist boss of the National Association of Manufacturers, also came out and lectured me, saying that the Communist Party cannot be spontaneous, but must be educated by Marxism-Leninism.

    Similarly, on the issue of the so-called imbalanced development in the struggle for socialism, the traitor Browder, with Tito-like cleverness and willfulness, used false Marxist arguments to support American imperialism and tried to teach me some Marxist primers. In the pamphlet I wrote, in opposing the prosecutor's statement that our party acted on the basis of the blueprint of the Russian Revolution, I pointed out the fact that many capitalist countries in the world are at different stages of growth and developing at different speeds. This is what Lenin explained in his law of imbalanced development. I also pointed out that these different conditions are bound to affect the development of the socialist movement in various countries, determining the institutions, strategies, and tactics of these countries, and nowhere have I said, indicated, or even implied that the different degrees and speeds of industrial development of these countries determine their respective programs or periods of revolution. On the contrary, I cited the Russian Revolution as an example to prove that the industrial development achieved by a particular country, in itself, is not enough to determine the degree of maturity of that country's revolution, and what I said is in line with Marxism-Leninism and is quite correct.

    The Question of the American People's Front Government

    In discussing the matter of the People's Front government in this country, we must first recognize that what we are talking about here is not a form of state, a form of state that American workers must establish in order to achieve socialism. What we are discussing, however, is general political strategy. At the Seventh Congress, Dimitrov had already dealt with this issue. He warned us that: "It is wrong to imagine that the united front government is an inevitable stage on the road to establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat." The truth of this passage is naturally and clearly illustrated by the fact that Russia did not have a People's Front government before the workers came to power. Who can say for sure that the American working class will not take this path? In addition, fascism may develop in this country before the workers and their allies establish a People's Front government, there is also this possibility.

    In any case, and this must be firmly emphasized, our policy is to strive for a People's Front government that is suited to the conditions of the United States. We do not have a policy of "choosing between the two," and we do not indulge in irrelevant political speculation on this matter. Dimitrov made this very clear at the Seventh Congress, although he did not regard the People's Front as an inevitable stage, he also emphasized as much as possible the urgent need to fight with all our strength for the People's Front. This clear policy, in its essence, is still correct for us today.

    The second big thing we must remember when advocating the establishment of a People's Front is that we can only make such an assumption in advance on the condition that the democratic masses of the people are able to elect such a government, that is, it is only possible to elect a People's Front government in the United States when the workers maintain sufficient democracy in the country to carry out such an election. However, in view of the advance of American imperialism towards fascism and war, it is really impossible to determine whether the workers can do this. If the reactionaries crush the democratic system and establish fascism at the same time, then, naturally, the possibility of electing a People's Front government will disappear, and the entire class struggle, even for the simplest demands, will become an open and fierce struggle.

    In the pamphlet I wrote, "In Defense of the Communist Party and Its Accused Leaders," when I simply mentioned this general topic, I pointed out: "The election of such a (People's Front) government must be strongly resisted by organized reactionaries." I said: "The entire history of the American class struggle, filled with the use of violence by employers in strikes and by the people in other struggles, teaches us this lesson most clearly." Therefore, it is obvious that the People's Front movement will inevitably crush this capitalist violence, and despite this violence, it must carry out the election to the end. This violence, as I have pointed out, is inevitable.

    Now let us roughly examine: to see under what conditions a People's Front government may appear in the United States. Without a doubt, it will inevitably arise against the backdrop of a very critical political situation. The awakened democratic masses who are moving towards the People's Front government will face the most powerful bourgeoisie in the world, a class that is determined to wage war and has rapidly adopted violent methods of fascist rule. Therefore, the People's Front movement, which has come into contact with the main policies of capitalist war and fascism, will inevitably be resisted by them with all their strength. In this environment of sharp political struggle, anyone who mentions peaceful elections is too naive. Anyone who only thinks of parliamentary electoral struggles in the face of the organized violence of the big capitalists is equally foolish. Obviously, and this is also the lesson that the People's Front movements in France, Spain, and elsewhere have given us, trade unions and every other workers' organization, as well as the allies of the workers, must invest all their strength in the People's Front struggle.

    The victorious battle to establish a People's Front government in the United States also includes defeating those entrenched labor leaders and establishing a solid united front of the working class. Especially important is the need for a Communist Party that is much stronger than it is now—a Communist Party that can give strong leadership to the People's Front. From the current difficult situation of the American workers, these seem to be strong demands. However, it is very possible that the People's Front movement will develop very rapidly in this country. It is possible to achieve rapid development of the movement due to the rapid spread of peace sentiments caused by Wall Street's dangerous war moves; due to the sharpening of the danger of fascism; due to the development of a deep economic crisis; or, most likely, due to the simultaneous outbreak of these factors.

    In the pamphlet I wrote, I said the following about our party's conditional handling of the election of the People's Front government:

    "The political line of our party is based on the assumption that in an economic and political situation that is at a critical juncture, it is possible for the broad masses of the people, under the militant leadership of trade unions and a powerful mass political party, to elect a united, anti-fascist, anti-imperialist government in the United States. Whether this possibility can last in the face of the dangerous fascist tendencies in the country is a very questionable matter."

    This is the line that our party has approved, and it is the correct line. To think that it is impossible to elect a People's Front government with special American characteristics in the United States is to say that fascism is inevitable in this country, and indeed, it is almost upon us. This, our party cannot say, nor has it said in the trial. We do not admit that fascism is inevitable, and for the same basic reason, we do not even admit that a Third World War is inevitable.

    The Party's Policy Towards the People's Front Government

    Now we come to a more complex theoretical question—what attitude will the Communist Party take towards the People's Front government once it is established in the United States?

    First, we need to understand that assuming that the democratic united forces are sufficient to defeat the fascist forces and finally establish a government, such a People's Front government in the United States will inevitably suffer the most violent firepower from the reactionaries in the early stages. This is an inevitable phenomenon, because such a government, if it wants to conform to the quality of a People's Front government, must do its best to frustrate Wall Street's war program and its plan to occupy the world. Therefore, it would be foolish not to estimate that the reactionary forces will unite and violently attack this government. Because Wall Street financial tycoons will not give up their program to conquer the world without making a final struggle.

    As I simply pointed out in my pamphlet, such a People's Front government, facing the violent attacks of the bourgeoisie, will only be able to lean to the left, otherwise it will be destroyed. That is to say, the People's Front can only turn from the defensive to the offensive. It cannot stop at being an obstacle to fascism and war. In order to achieve the above goals and generally implement those programs, it must attack the monopolists in the economic, military, and political fields, otherwise it will be put to death.

    Merely gaining a majority of seats in Congress for the People's Front government is not enough to control the power of the capitalist state—there is no need for all Marxist-Leninists to explain this enlightening truth. In such a situation, the true foundations of power—the army, the police, industry, the courts, the banks, government agencies, and schools—are still firmly in the hands of the big bourgeoisie. The big bourgeoisie can use these institutions through the leaders of the social democrats to deal with the new People's Front government. Therefore, any coalition government of democratic, anti-Wall Street war and fascism programs in the United States will inevitably be forced to attack the monopolists. It must change from a defensive program, a program that only strives to curb the war-mongers, to the nationalization of banks and industries, the destruction of the system of large land ownership, the start of a planned economy, and the elimination of reactionaries in all state organs, otherwise, it will go against history.

    Naturally, the leftward lean of the People's Front government can only be completed on the resistance of the bourgeoisie—including the right-wing social democratic agents in the People's Front government. It also requires the clear leadership of the Communist Party and the active support of trade unions and all people's organizations.

    As long as such a People's Front government blocks war and fascism for a day, the communists must defend it and not allow the reactionaries to overthrow it. Communists should point out that such a government cannot block war and fascism for long if it does not adopt other countermeasures to strike at the roots of the monopoly forces. Whether these revolutionary reforms are realized in the process of defending this government, or whether this government refuses to implement the reforms and is therefore replaced by a government of the working class due to the struggle of the masses, it is difficult to predict at this moment.

    In short, a People's Front government is not enough to achieve final victory and completely eliminate the danger of fascist counter-revolution. Only a socialist revolution can do it.

    Everyone should remember what I wrote in the pamphlet: A People's Front government is bound to tend towards a positive and militant policy, otherwise it will inevitably perish. The capitalists will destroy it, either with Blum-style (post-war leader of the French Socialist Party, one of the main advocates of the Third Way in Western Europe—translator) spies lurking from within, or with Franco-style counter-revolutionary violence from without; more likely, it will be a combination of the two. This is the basic lesson of the People's Front experience in France, Spain, and other countries.

    Communists must never sit idly by and watch the defeat or overthrow of the American People's Front government. We must do everything in our power to enable the workers to use such a government as a tool for positive struggle. Any action other than this is tantamount to surrendering the People's Front to the right-wing social democrats and letting them finally crush and defeat it. If we only recall the sharp political situation under which the People's Front government was established, we can predict the consequences of such a defeat. The situation created by the combined suppression of such a government by the capitalists and their social democratic puppets is bound to make the fighting forces of the proletariat feel extremely flustered, thus enabling the big capitalists to launch the Third World War they have planned, and (or) establish fascism in the United States. Therefore, the success or failure of the People's Front government is of profound significance. Communists cannot knowingly participate in such a People's Front government if it is bound to end in a disastrous defeat. We must always have our eyes on the prospect of victory.

    In the past, communists have not always understood the necessity of resolutely fighting for a leftward lean when participating in coalition governments or People's Front governments. This weakness can be seen in some communist parties in the post-war European coalition governments. As early as the Seventh Congress, Dimitrov seriously warned against this right-leaning error by criticizing the behavior of the communists in the Saxon workers' government in Germany in 1923. He pointed out that those communists did not fight for revolutionary means as the situation urgently required, but instead "acted like ordinary members in other bourgeois democracies." Although the People's Front or democratic coalition government is not yet on the political agenda in the United States, as Marxist-Leninists, we can already profitably understand our general tasks in such a situation.

    On the Question of People's Democracy

    The nature and tasks of People's Democracy are another complex issue, and we have not given it the overall treatment it deserves. Therefore, further clarification on this issue will enable our party to have a fully clear understanding of it.

    There are four specific areas of People's Democracy that need to be clarified. First, the application of the slogan "support People's Democracy" in the United States itself. In the current situation in the United States, we can definitely say that this slogan "support People's Democracy" does not represent action, or even active agitation. However, it does represent a possible development, although it is not inevitable, and we must use it, which is why we are here.

    The second thing to keep in mind is that there is a qualitative difference between People's Democracy and the People's Front. The basic difference is that the People's Front government operates within the scope of the bourgeois state, while People's Democracy is a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The People's Front cuts down the powers of the monopoly capitalists and war-mongers, while People's Democracy fundamentally smashes all their power and embarks on the road to socialism. In my pamphlet "In Defense of the Communist Party and Its Accused Leaders," I pointed out that People's Democracy is a form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. But in general, the basic differences between the two are not sharp and clear enough to avoid all possible misunderstandings. As Comrade Dennis pointed out at our recent National Committee Congress, we must never allow our party's line to be misinterpreted as a compromise balance between the People's Front and People's Democracy, or as a simple evolution between the two.

    The third aspect of the question of People's Democracy that we must clearly recognize is that People's Democracy cannot be established within a specific country until the bourgeoisie has been finally and decisively defeated. That is to say, the Communist Party occupies a leading position in the working class. In my pamphlet, when mentioning the general political situation in the Eastern European countries where People's Democracy has been established, I said: "The smashing of the capitalist state machine, which Marx, Lenin, and Stalin listed as a condition for the success of the revolution many years ago, has been largely completed by the people in the great anti-fascist war." The Soviet army played a decisive role in crushing Hitler's war machine and preventing European counter-revolutionaries from attacking the new People's Democracy.

    Regarding People's Democracy, the fourth important consideration that we should keep in mind is that it is a transitional form of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The full maturity of the People's Democratic states in Eastern Europe is not achieved overnight. Although they adopted the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat from the beginning, they grew and consolidated in the revolutionary struggle against the capitalist reactionaries. Initially, the People's Democratic states were coalition governments composed of all parties that resisted fascism during the war. These coalition governments included socialists, social democrats, peasant parties, Catholic parties, and even small capitalist parties. The powerful leader of these coalition governments was the powerful Communist Party. Under the dual pressure of the advancing workers and peasants who believed in socialism on the one hand, and the counter-revolutionary American and domestic reactionaries on the other, the People's Democratic states in Eastern Europe quickly strengthened and consolidated with the help of the Soviet Union. The Communist Party grew enormously and finally merged with the social democrats. Trade unions also expanded rapidly and their strength increased greatly. Several coalition governments systematically purged the leading reactionaries from the army, the police, government agencies, schools, and industries. Bourgeois elements were expelled from the government, and most of their parties were dissolved. Industries were nationalized, and the program of distributing large estates was vigorously promoted. The consolidation of this People's Democracy was not completed automatically, but was the most acute form of class struggle, even to the point of civil war in some countries—such as Poland. At times, the struggle against the domestic reactionaries instigated by American imperialism was so intense that it even threatened the existence of the young revolutionary government itself.

    On the Question of Socialist "Encirclement"

    The essence of this so-called encirclement proposition is twofold: (1) socialism is rapidly expanding in the world, while capitalism is generally mired in a general crisis, and (2) the more socialism expands in the world, the more the position of American imperialism is weakened. If American imperialism dares to use war to try to reverse this inevitable law of development, the result of force can only accelerate the demise of capitalism and the growth of socialism.

    It would naturally be a serious mistake to conclude that because the development of socialism in the world has weakened American imperialism, American capitalists would feel that they are in a position of being unable to fight. On the contrary, the weakening of the position of the capitalist world and the failure of American foreign policy have made these capitalists more inclined to reckless war adventures, and the current dangerous war preparations propaganda clearly illustrates this. Our Communist Party understood this principle long ago, and we have explained it several times in analyzing the war crisis. As Comrade Suslov recently explained Lenin's words: "Historical experience tells us that the more desperate the position of the imperialist reactionaries becomes, the more vicious they become: the more likely they are to launch military adventures." (See "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy," December 2, 1949)

    This concept is completely contrary to the set of arguments that Browder once tried to impose on our party. Applying his American exceptionalism and the glory of American capitalism, he declared that American capitalism has become so powerful that there is no possibility of socialistization in other important regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America, and Canada. In this regard, we only need to recall his shameful letter to the Australian Communist Party. This letter criticized the Australian comrades for being "left-leaning" because they offered a socialist vision for their country. Browder argued with them that Australia is so economically subject to the United States that it cannot adopt socialism without Wall Street's consent. Browder's policy was to make world socialism fail and to make a world capitalism dominated by American imperialism last forever.

    Of course, the responsibility for establishing socialism in the United States rests entirely on the shoulders of the American working class and its political allies. They will also receive strong and increasing support from the developing world socialism. Naturally, it would be very foolish to conclude from this that all American workers only need to sit still and wait for the socialist workers in other countries to solve the problem for them. The working class will never come to such a foolish conclusion. On the contrary, despite American imperialism's attempt to make the American people and the world believe that it is powerful and invincible, the progress of world socialism has weakened the position of American imperialism. Recognizing this, the American working class can greatly strengthen, not weaken, its daily struggle and final decisive battle to win socialism.

    Force and Violence

    In the trial, generally speaking, we correctly raised the complex issue of force and violence in the class struggle. In this matter, we specifically encountered direct accusations against us. Marx pointed out long ago that the essence of our position is: in history, the ruling class has never been willing to give way to the emerging revolutionary class, and it will do everything in its power to use any weapon to preserve itself; second, the working class and its allies, led by the Communist Party, will be strong enough to defeat all the violence of the ruling class, and this is bound to be encountered on the road to socialism.

    However, it is not enough for us to simply repeat that the workers must and will be able to use their own superior strength to defeat the violence of the employers. The whole issue of the use of force in the class struggle must be examined from the current strategic point of view, based on the recently greatly changed comparison of class forces and the general crisis of capitalism at home and abroad.

    When we say that the forces of world democracy and socialism are stronger today than the forces of capitalist reaction that make war, this argument contains extremely important significance both domestically and internationally, especially for the bourgeoisie's use of violence and the attitude of the working class towards this violence. This means that the democratic forces now have the possibility and the necessity to mobilize their superior potential strength to weaken the bourgeoisie's ability to use violence against the people.

    In my pamphlet, I pointed out that immediately after the war, there was a broad, relatively peaceful, and orderly progress towards socialism in the People's Democratic states. This is a fact, and the only reason why such a situation could exist (even if it was temporary) is that, on the one hand, the bourgeois state machine was destroyed by the war and the historical liberation mission of the Soviet army, and on the other hand, the democratic and socialist state machine has been

　　人民阵线与人民民主
    美国共产党主席  福斯特
    在福莱广场对我党及其领袖的审判中，我们面临着一项控告，说我们曾经阴谋教唆及倡议用武力和暴力来推翻美国政府。为了确当地答复这项虚伪的控告，我们不但必须阐明马列主义的一般原则，简叙我党的历史，而且必须要指明在我们以及其他国家中为社会主义斗争的主要路线。我党于辩护时，——这种辩护基本上是对资本主义的进攻——发展了一个正确的马列主义的路线。特别是，我们已经把在阶级斗争中，使用暴力的责任，放在应该放的地方，放到资产阶级及其政府的肩上。
    在提交给法庭的材料中，有我的一本题名为《为共产党及其被控告的领袖而辩护》的小册子。这本小册子是曾由全国委员会一致同意，作为党在审判中的政策的。在这本小册子里，我为着适应辩护的急需，除阐论共产党的一般政策之外，更在理论及实践两重意义上，简述了自一九三五年共产国际第七届大会以来，世界共产党在统一战线政策方面的经验。这样做的时候，我分析了战前的反法西斯人民阵线的政策，战时的全国团结一致的政策，以及战后反帝的人民阵线政策与人民民主政策。
    因此，这本小册子所包括的理论与策略的范围是很广泛的。它涉及了过去十五年中重大世界斗争的全部错综复杂。使这工作更为困难的是，所经历的领域，很多是相当新的。大体上，这本小册子中所展开的基本分析是正确的。但是由于主题的广泛、复杂与新颖，以及处理这主题的简短方式，小册子中自然会，而且的确已经包含了某些错误及缺点。当然，我们大家都知道，许多欧洲的共产党领袖，在初次分析对这个一般经验的各部分时，也曾经犯过错误的。照我的意见，我的小册子里最严重的缺点是它的最后一部，在论及美国共产党的政策时，关于人民阵线的策略与新的人民民主国家的一些重要论点，虽然论点本身在基本上是正确的，但却叙述得太简略，缺乏清晰充分的阐释。这就使得这些论点容易被误解与歪曲，也使得我们必须充分地发挥所有这些事情的涵义。正如但尼斯同志在一九五○年三月全国委员会上曾经正确地指出的，党内曾经有过某些误解或曲解党在审判中正确路线的倾向，充分的发挥因而更为需要了。所以，我现在写这篇文章，有着一个特殊目的，要来澄清及阐明在审判期间，尤其是在我的小册子中所论及的一些问题。
    法西斯主义的意义
    一九三五年共产国际第七届大会上季米特洛夫同志清扫了当时流行的社会民主党的谬论，其大意是说法西斯主义是“中产阶级的叛变”。季米特洛夫同志正确地指出法西斯主义的特点，是“最为反动，最为沙文主义的，最为帝国主义的金融资本分子的公开恐怖的独裁。”季米特洛夫更说，法西斯主义是“由于资本主义制度没落的结果而出现的”。当资本主义的总危机更为加深之时，法西斯主义运动便成为垄断资本，在阻止工人阶级胜利的绝望挣扎中不可避免的归宿。这是我们在工作中必须牢记于心的一个事实。很显然地，由于现实——如果不是由于理论——，已经明白了他们的社会制度是处在严重危机之中的大资本家们，并无意袖手旁观，一任这种制度破碎。因此法西斯主义，以及它那种有组织的，想以内战及世界战争政策来破坏民主和社会主义的企图，基本上乃是金融资本的一种努力，来克服资本主义的总危机，同时来为自己（具体说来，就是华尔街）取得全部世界霸权。
    法西斯主义在资本主义总危机的肇端之始，便扎下它的固定的根。这由反动势力在俄国革命一开始时便想粉碎这个革命的无情企图里，由他们在第一次大战后想粉碎中欧工人革命斗争的无情企图里，都可以清楚地看得出来。但是，法西斯主义之成为一种统治方式，首先是在一九二二年，墨索里尼把意大利抓到手里的时候。一九三三年，希特勒在世界大经济危机当中把德国抓到了手里，法西斯主义终于变成了一个全世界的威胁。在这一个总的时期中，法国、英国、美国及其他资本主义国家里的大资本家们，也感染上了法西斯主义的观念。因此，法西斯主义绝不单纯是德、意、日三国的现象，虽然由于特殊的原因，它只在轴心国家里才当了权。它表现了世界上最大的资本家们，在日益加深的资本主义危机面前，在成长中的社会主义的面前的总趋向。轴心国家里的大金融资本家们，梦想着一种法西斯世界，这世界由他们自己统治，而以对苏联的全面攻击为开端。但是各国人民的民主力量的抵抗，苏联的力量，以及资本主义国家中间的剧烈矛盾，使得轴心国家不能实现其预谋的进攻，在世界民主及社会主义的废墟上建立起一个法西斯世界。经验显示出法西斯主义并不能清除帝国主义间的敌对性，却反而使其尖锐化了。
    因此，从这一切中我们必须了解的最基本事情之一，就是说：向着战争与法西斯主义挺进，过去不是，现在也不是大资产阶级的一时现象。相反地，这是他们（尤其是美国帝国主义）基本的方向，这是他们克服资本主义总危机的一种企图。这说明了为什么各国的垄断资本家，在华尔街的侵略性的领导下，如此急忙地努力，在各地重组那些在第二次大战中已被击溃了的法西斯集团与运动。法西斯主义在战争中是打败了；但是帝国主义资产阶级的趋势是继续走向法西斯主义。法西斯主义仍然充满了毒素。低估它的危险，的确会成为一个严重的错误。
    我们必须了解的关于法西斯主义的另一件要事，就是法西斯主义带给了垄断资本家们一个更高度自觉的反革命的展望，他们不管如何地不可能，仍去挽救那正面临着资本主义总危机日益加深的社会制度。在七届大会上，季米特洛夫就这一个总的方面说过如下的话：“统治的资产阶级正愈来愈甚地从法西斯主义中觅取救药，其目的是要制订特殊的剥削劳动者的方法，准备帝国主义的战争，攻击苏联，奴役并瓜分中国，以这一切手段来防止革命。”
    在资本主义的总危机发展之前——这种危机一方面引起社会主义的成长，另一方面导致资本主义制度的更进一步的衰落——资本家们及其理论家尚未遭遇到对于他们的社会制度的尖锐威胁。可是，资本主义总危机的发展，世界社会主义的挑战，横暴地震撼了垄断资本家们。他们大吃一惊，发现他们的制度正处于危险中。因而他们便有意识地接受了法西斯主义的展望——尽管他们如何掩饰这个展望，以避免群众的反对。自然，这样一来，并没有给这么混乱的资本主义制度提供一个明确的远景。也没有避免帝国主义国家之间的最厉害的冲突；事实上，法西斯主义却加剧了这些冲突。这种有意识的向法西斯主义推进的政策，使它带有双料的恶毒，与加倍的威胁，这是我们必须清清楚楚地经常记在心上的。
    反法西斯、反战运动
    法西斯统治对于世界各民族的生活水准，传统自由，民主组织，民族独立，甚至于对他们的生存本身，都是一个无情的攻击。因此，法西斯主义在战前的猖狂，不可避免地引起了一个非常广泛而富有战斗性的民主力量反抗的群众运动。这个广泛的运动把工人、农民、黑人、知识分子以及小商人吸收到它的范围中来；这个运动也把天主教徒、社会民主党人、自由主义者、共产党人以及非党分子——这一个广大系列的民主力量——之间的思想意识的差异沟通起来。这些民主阶层与集团，过去从来没有如此团结过。他们都为一个决心所鼓舞，那即是抵抗并击败法西斯主义这一个新的社会瘟疫——防止恐怖统治之被建立，防止世界之被投入战争。（⑴⑷）
    战前的这一伟大的反法西斯、反战运动，有两个基本特点，要加以说明。首先，其中有着很大成分的防御性。那即是说，这运动的目的，是要保存心爱的民主权利与民主组织，使其不受法西斯主义的攻击；但同时，这个运动也包含着巨大的反攻潜力——在战时与战后，这种潜力一定会导致民主人民的主要胜利。反法西斯、反战运动的第二个基本特点是其巨大的政治阔度。已经说过，人民阵线的政策，利用了一切既存的可能性，让各种思想意识集团的工人，以及各种中层阶级的力量，比肩而立，——尽管此中不无许多困难——反对共同的敌人。
    在这个总的方面，我们现在应该清楚地记取的一件最重要的事，那即是：如果战争与法西斯主义是今天世界局势中的一个威胁——事实上正是如此——那末各国人民便必须发展一个广泛的，为和平斗争及反对法西斯主义的统一战线。由于法西斯主义在战争中所受的毁灭性的失败，更鉴于战后时期民主的发展，就有了一种倾向，感觉到法西斯的危险已不复存在，因此，就认为反法西斯、反战的人民阵线的需要也消失了。有两种主要的力量，培养了并利用了这个群众的幻觉。首先是美国帝国主义，在它追求世界霸权时，它首先必须突破这个曾经赢得战争的，广泛的反法西斯民主力量的联盟。第二便是右翼民主社会党人——资本主义的忠实仆役——他们实行这种分裂政策，是为着要打击工人阶级的普遍的革命情绪。因此这两个力量，自然还加上梵蒂冈的帮助，就蓄意分裂资本主义世界中，包括职工运动在内的反法西斯的联盟。他们并且建立了所谓的“第三种力量”运动。这个运动，正如以后已经清楚地表明了的，不过是美国帝国主义的一个附属品，它铺平了走向极端反动与法西斯主义的道路。
    但是“第三种力量”，虽然为美国及其他资本主义政府，为梵蒂冈，为右翼社会民主党所支持；虽然鉴于许多工人都堕入了反苏的困扰赤色分子以及帝国主义幻想的圈套里，却只能是暂时性的。正在全世界飞速地发展起来的法西斯主义与新的战争危机的增长，其结果必然要使迄今尚在社会民主党及其他反动领导下的民主群众与全部“第三种力量”的观念决裂，使他们与左翼力量联合起来，共同发展一个强大的反战反法西斯运动，这运动主要的是遵循人民阵线的路线的，虽然这种事情不会自动地产生。的确，“第三种力量”分裂的征兆已经显著地存在了。这些征兆，可用新近法国及比利时的罢工作为例证说明。在这些罢工中，天主教，社会党者及共产党的工人比肩反抗他们“第三种力量”的政府，反对社会民主党和梵蒂冈的领袖们。从这里得来的主要的教训是拥护人民阵线的口号仍旧是有效的，虽然在目前新的世界形势下，这口号的主要内容必定是反帝反战的，并且我们赋与这种内容以各种可能的形式与变化，使之成为口号时，必须能十分灵活才行。
    人民阵线的政策
    共产国际在它的一九三五年的第七届大会上，在斯大林与季米特洛夫的领导下，掌握了由于纳粹德国的勃兴而引起的新的世界形势的意义，并且发展了人民阵线的政策去打击法西斯和战争的威胁，这是一件了不起的理论上与实际上的政治成就。大会建议动员一切民主阶层，联合起来与奴役群众的行为，与新的世界战争作斗争，这种动员连带地引起了某些重要的政策上的与行动上的转变。大会坦白地，勇敢地采取了这些转变。季米特洛夫在他著名的报告里强调这些转变，说：“我们的大会，是规定共产国际策略新的方针的大会。”
    共产主义的策略的新方针的实质是双重的：（一）订出一个广泛的反法西斯、反战的纲领与组织形式，这纲领与组织形式要广泛到足以把那强大的民主群众都包括在内，资本主义危机与法西斯战争威胁已经使他们在政治上动起来了。（二）规定共产党在特别情况下参加由反法西斯反战的斗争中发展出来的政府。这些新的策略观念，不必重复说明，是与整个马列主义的原则完全符合的。
    如同马克思、列宁、斯大林教导我们的，政治战略与政治策略不是永远不变的，而必须演进以顺应变化中的环境。因此，第七届大会所规定的策略，一方面基本上仍然是正确的，另一方面由于世界形势的根本改变，它在以后的惊涛骇浪的十五年中经过了若干改变，生长与发展，这是一点也不奇怪的。如果以为可以不是那样的话，倒是可笑的了。在后来的许多发展中，可以提到的有：战争期间遵行的民族的与国际的统一团结路线；建立战后东欧人民民主国家时所应用的新政策；共产党的参加法国、意大利的联合政府；伟大的中国革命的胜利发展——二十四年前斯大林就指出这一发展的主要路线了。当全世界争取社会主义的斗争在进展时，无疑地共产党的政策将有其他的重要的策略上的发展。在这里主要的是要说明，所有过去十五年中一切策略的（有时是战略的）转变，都符合那次著名的共产国际第七届大会的健全的马列主义路线的。
    这使我想起所谓“到达社会主义的新途径”这一问题，自从战后在东欧人民民主国家兴起以来，这问题被谈论得很多了。有一时期，在展开对这些重要问题的理论分析时，有一些思想是含混的，人民民主国家中的共产党领袖亦有这种情形。我们党（包括我的著作在内）在分析时，也表现了这类的不恰当的看法。
    我在我的一本小册子《为共产党及其被控告的领袖而辩护》中，引用了当时流行的一个说法，“到达社会主义的新途径”（自此以后，各人民民主国家的党已拒用那个名词了），我是从策略观点来提的。
    当然，简单确切的事实是，从策略上讲，东欧人民民主国家及中华人民共和国的工人在实现社会主义的过程中，所用的策略是与俄国工人阶级的策略不同的。而且也不得不如此。要是有人想在这一切差别很大的情况下都应用呆板不变的策略的话，他们就是政治笨伯，而非马列主义者。这些策略上的变化是十分重要的，好的或坏的策略，在一定的情况之下，所造成的差别是胜利或失败。但是，在阶级斗争进行中，不管必须采取什么策略上的变化，到达社会主义的道路是相同的——那就是击败资产阶级，建立无产阶级专政。
    自发性和不平衡的发展
    让我在这里插进几句话，是关于阶级斗争中的“自发性”和“不平衡发展”的问题的。在我写的“为共产党及其被控告的领袖而辩护”的小册子里头，我说过世界上伟大的共产主义运动是“自发”的，以其已生根于各别国家特有的民族条件里面。我举出这个显而易见的事实，以驳斥政府的诬告，他们说这些共产党及其所领导的伟大的人民运动，是人工的创造，“苏联第五纵队”的作品——这个时候，恰好全国制造商联合会的自命为马克思主义者的头子白劳德先生也出来了，并且把我教训了一番，说什么共产党不能是自发的，而必须受到马列主义的教益。
    同样的，在为社会主义而斗争的所谓不平衡发展的问题上，叛徒白劳德，用铁托一般的伶俐与恣肆，以假马克思主义的论断，支持着美国帝国主义，企图教我一些马克思主义的入门浅说。在我写的小册子中，在反对检察官所说的我们党在俄国革命的蓝图的基础上行事这一点上面，我指出了世界上许多资本主义国家，是处在不同的长成阶段上，以不同的速度发展着这一事实。这是列宁在他的不平衡发展的规律里面所说明了的。我也指出这些不同的条件，势必影响到社会主义运动在各种国家里面的发展，决定了这些国家的机构、战略和战术，在什么地方我都不曾说过、示意或者甚至暗示过，这些国家工业发展的不同程度和速度，决定了它们革命的各别的程序或时期。相反的，我举出俄国革命为例，是为了证明一个特定的国家所获致的工业发展，仅仅这一点，不足以决定那个国家革命的成熟程度，我所说的是符合马列主义的，而且颇为正确。
    美国人民阵线政府的问题
    在讨论这个国家里面的人民阵线政府的事情上，一开头我们便必须认识到我们在这儿所讲的，不是一种国家形式，一种美国工人要达到社会主义所必须建立起来的国家形式。我们所讨论的，却是一般的政治策略。在第七届大会上，季米特洛夫已经处理过这个问题。他警告我们说：“如果想像统一战线的政府，是建立无产阶级专政的道路上一个必不可免的阶段，那是错误的。”这一段话的真确性，由于在工人执政以前，俄国并没有人民阵线政府这一事实，而自然而然地清楚说明了。谁能够肯定地说美国的工人阶级，不采取这条路径呢？此外，在工人和他们的同盟军建立起人民阵线政府以前，法西斯主义也许在这个国家发达起来，也有这个可能性。
    无论如何，而且这必须坚定强调出来的，我们的方针是争取一个适合美国情况的人民阵线政府。我们没有一种“取舍于两者之间”的政策，我们在这件事情上，也不沈缅于不着边际的政治推敲。季米特洛夫在第七届大会上，也把这一点说得十分清楚，他虽则不把人民阵线当作必不可免的阶段，他同时却尽一切可能强调了为人民阵线而全力斗争的火急的需要。这个明确的政策，在其本质上，对于我们今天，还是正确的。
    在主张建立人民阵线时，我们必须记住的第二件大事情，是我们只能够有条件地事前作这样的假设：人民的民主群众能够选举出这样的一个政府来，即：只有工人们在国内维持足够的民主，以进行这样一种选举的时候，在美国推选人民阵线的政府，才成为可能。但是，鉴于美国帝国主义向法西斯主义与战争的挺进，工人们能否这样做，实在不能断定。如果反动派打垮了民主制度，同时建立起法西斯主义来，那么，自然罗，选出一个人民阵线政府的可能性，就会消失了，而整个的阶级斗争，即使是为了最简单的要求，也就要变成了公开的、剧烈的斗争。
    在我写的“为共产党及其被控告的领袖而辩护”的小册子里面，我简单的提到这个总的题目时，我指出过：“这样一个（人民阵线）政府的选举，一定要遭到有组织的反动派的强烈的对抗。”我说：“充满了雇主在罢工中以及人民在其他争斗中使用暴力的整个美国阶级斗争的历史，把这个教训再清晰没有地教导了我们。”所以，显然地，人民阵线的运动，势将粉碎这种资本家的暴力，而且尽管有这种暴力，也必须把选举进行到底。这种暴力，正如我所指出过，是不可避免的。
    现在让我们约略地考查一下：看看在什么条件之下，人民阵线政府可能在美国出现。毫无疑义，它势将在一个十分危急的政治局势的背景上产生。走向人民阵线政府的觉醒了的民主群众，势将面对世界上最强有力的资产阶级，这个阶级立意战争，而且已经迅速采用了暴烈的法西斯统治的方法。因此，与资本家战争和法西斯的主要政策碰了头的人民阵线运动，就一定会遭到他们全力的反抗。在这种尖锐的政治斗争环境里面，有谁还提到和平选举，那他未免太天真了。在大资本家的有组织的暴力前面，有谁只想到议会选举的斗争，他也同样的愚蠢。显然地，而这也是法国、西班牙和其他地方的人民阵线运动所给我们的教训，工会和其他每一个工人组织，以及工人们的同盟军，势须把他们的全部力量，投进人民阵线的斗争里面去。
    在美国建立人民阵线政府的胜利战斗，也包含把那些深沟高垒以自掩护的劳工领袖打败，以及建立一条坚固的工人阶级的统一战线。尤其重要的，需要一个比现在强大得多——能够给人民阵线以坚强领导的共产党。从美国工人们目前的艰难处境看来，这些似乎是强烈的要求。但是，人民阵线运动在这个国家里面将很迅速地发展，是很可能的。由于华尔街危险的战争举动，而引起和平情绪的迅速蔓延起来；由于法西斯主义危险的尖锐化；由于深刻经济危机的发展；或者最可能的，由于有这些因素的一起发作；运动的迅速发展，可以获致。
    在我写的那本小册子里面，我就我们党有条件地处理人民阵线政府选举的问题，说过下列的话：
    “我们党的政治路线，是根据这样的假定：即在紧要关头的经济与政治局面中，广大的人民群众，在工会和一个强大的群众性的政党的战斗性的领导下，在美国选出一个联合的、反法西斯的、反帝国主义的政府，是可能的。面对着国内危险的法西斯倾向，这个可能性能否持久，则殊成问题。”
    这是我们党批准了的路线，这是正确的路线。认为在美国不可能选出一个具有美国特殊形式的人民阵线政府，就是说法西斯主义在这个国家内是不可避免的，而且真地，差不多光临到我们头上。这个，我们党不能够这样说，在审判中也不曾这样说。我们不承认法西斯主义是不可避免的，为了同样基本的理由，我们甚至也不承认第三次世界大战是不可避免的。
    党对于人民阵线政府的政策
    现在我们轮到了一个比较复杂的理论问题——如果人民阵线政府一旦在美国建立起来，共产党对它将持怎样的态度。
    首先我们需要了解的，即假定民主联合势力足以击败法西斯势力，最后建立起一个政府来，这样一个人民阵线政府在美国初期必遭受反动分子最凶猛的火力。这是无可避免的现象，因为这样一个政府，如果想符合一个人民阵线政府的品质，必须全力去挫折华尔街大亨们的战争纲领及霸占世界的计划。因此，如果不估计反动势力将联合起来，猛烈地向这个政府攻击，那倒是愚蠢的事。因为华尔街财阀们不作一番最后挣扎，是不会放弃征服世界的纲领的。
    如我在我的小册子中很简单地指陈的，这样一个人民阵线政府面对着资产阶级猛烈的攻击，只有左倾，不然便会被消灭。那即是说，人民阵线只有由守势转入攻势。它不能止于做法西斯及战争的障碍物。为了达到上述目标，并普遍实施那些纲领，它必须在经济、军事及政治领域，向垄断者攻袭，否则必被置之于死地。
    仅仅在国会中为人民阵线政府攫得多数议席并不能就足以控制资本主义国家的政权——所有马列主义者对这一启蒙的真理都无须说明。在这样形势下，政权的真正基础——军队、警察、工业、法庭、银行、政府机构、学校——都依然稳握在大资产阶级的掌心。大资产阶级很可以假手社会民主党首领，利用以上的机构来对付新的人民阵线政府。因此，任何民主的反华尔街战争与法西斯主义政纲的联合政府在美国，势必被迫向垄断家进攻。它必须由一个守势的政纲，一个仅仅努力遏止战争贩子的政纲，转而趋向银行、工业的国有化，摧毁大量占有土地的制度，开始实行计划经济，消灭所有国家机关中的反动分子等，不然，便会与历史相左。
    自然，人民阵线政府的左倾只有在资产阶级——包括人民阵线政府内的右翼社会民主党代理人的顽抗上，才能完成的。它并且需要共产党的明确领导，及工会以及所有人民团体的积极支持。
    只要这样的人民阵线政府阻挡战争与法西斯一天，共产党人一定保卫它，不让反动派把它倾覆。共产党人应指出，这样一个政府如果不采用别的对策来打击垄断势力的根基，是不能长久阻挡战争与法西斯主义的。这些革命的改革是在保卫这个政府的过程中实现呢，还是这个政府拒绝实施改革，因而由于群众的奋斗，代之以工人阶级的政府，此刻自难预卜。
    总之，一个人民阵线政府不足以取得最后胜利，彻底消灭法西斯反革命的危险。只有社会主义革命才能做到。
    大家要记住我在小册子中所写的：一个人民阵线政府势必趋向一个积极、战斗的政策，否则必然灭亡。资本家会毁灭它的，不是从里面埋伏勃鲁姆（战后法社会党党魁，为西欧第三路线首要提倡者之一——译者）式的奸细，便是从外面来一个佛朗哥式的反革命暴力；更可能是二者兼而有之。这是法国、西班牙及其他国家人民阵线经验中的基本教训。
    共产党人绝不容坐视美国人民阵线政府的溃败或颠覆。我们势必尽我们能力所及，使工人能利用这样一个政府做为积极斗争的一个工具。除此以外的行径都形同把人民阵线投降给右翼社会民主党分子，听其最后粉碎败北。这样失败的后果，我们只要回想一下人民阵线政府是在怎样尖锐的政治局势下才建立起来的，就可以预卜。这样一个政府之为资本家及其社会民主党傀儡合力扑灭所造成的形势，必然使无产阶级的战斗力量极感慌乱，因而使大资本家发动其所设计的第三次大战，并（或者）在美国建立起法西斯主义。因此，人民阵线政府的成败是有着深切意义的。共产党人不可能明知其必然惨败而参加这样一个人民阵线政府。我们必须始终着眼在胜利的远景。
    共产党人过去在参加联合政府或人民阵线政府时，并不一贯明白为左倾而坚决斗争的必要性。这个弱点，在战后欧洲若干联合政府中的有些共产党的身上可以看见。远在第七届大会之时，季米特洛夫便借对一九二三年德国萨克逊尼工人政府里共产党人行为的批评，来严重警告这种右倾错误。他指出那些共产党人并不依形势所迫切需要地为革命手段而战斗，反而“如其他资产阶级民主中的一般议员一样”。虽然人民阵线或民主联合政府在目前还未列入美国的政治议程，但是做为马列主义者，我们已经可以有利地了解到在这样形势下我们一般的任务了。
    关于人民民主问题
    人民民主的性质与任务是另一个复杂问题，我们没有给它应有的全盘处理。因此，在这个问题上多加阐明，使我党对它有充分明确的理解。
    人民民主有四个特别需要阐明的地方。第一，便是“拥护人民民主”在美国，这个口号本身的应用。在目前美国的情势下，我们可以肯定说这个“拥护人民民主”的口号并不代表行动，甚而积极鼓动。然而它却代表一种可能的发展，尽管那不是必然的，我们必须用它也就在此。
    第二件需要牢记的是，人民民主与人民阵线之间是有着质的区别的。基本的区别是人民阵线政府是在资产阶级国家范围内活动的，而人民民主是无产阶级专政的一种形式。人民阵线削减垄断资本家及战贩的权限，而人民民主是根本粉碎其全部权力，而迈上社会主义的道路。在我那本《为共产党及其被控告的领袖而辩护》的小册子中，我指出人民民主是无产阶级专政的形式。但一般说来，这二者的基本区别并不尖锐明确到足以避免一切可能的误解。如同但尼斯同志在最近我们全国委员会大会上所指陈的，我们切不可任我们党的路线曲解成为人民阵线与人民民主之间的一种折衷平衡，或是二者之间的一种单纯演变。
    人民民主这个问题的第三方面，我们也必须明确认识，在资产阶级尚未最后地并决定性地被击溃前，人民民主在一特定的国家之内，是建立不起来的。这就是说，共产党在工人阶级中是占领导地位的。在我的小册子中，提到人民民主已经建立起来的东欧国家中总的政治情况时，我说：“马克思、列宁及斯大林多年前的便列为革命成功条件的资本家的国家机器的打碎，在伟大的反法西斯战争中已为人民大致完成了。”苏联军队在粉碎希特勒的战争机构及阻止欧洲反革命分子向新的人民民主进攻上，起了决定的作用。
    关于人民民主，我们应该牢记的第四个重要考虑即是，它是无产阶级专政的一种过渡方式。东欧的人民民主国家之充分长成也不是一朝一夕的事。虽然从开始它们便采取了无产阶级专政的方式，它们是在与资本家反动派的革命斗争中成长、巩固的。最初，各人民民主国家是集大战期间反抗法西斯的所有党派组成的联合政府。这种联合政府包括社会党、社会民主党、农民党、天主教党，甚至小资本家党。这种联合政府的强大领导者是势力雄厚的共产党。在双重压力之下，一边是前进中的信仰社会主义的工人及农民，一边是反革命的美国及国内的反动派，东欧人民民主国家在苏联援助之下，都很迅速地加强巩固起来。共产党庞大地成长着，最后是与社会民主党合并了。工会也迅速扩展着，力量巨大地增加着。几个联合政府有步骤地把反动派的首要由军队、警察、政府机关、学校、工业中肃清。资产阶级分子由政府中被逐了出来，他们的政党也大多解散了。工业国有化了，分散大地产的政纲大力地推行了。这种人民民主国家的巩固并不是自动完成的，而是阶级斗争最尖锐的一种形式，在有些国家，甚至到了内战的地步——如同波兰。有的时候，与美国帝国主义所鼓动的国内反动派进行的斗争，紧张得甚至威胁到年青的革命政府本身的存在。
    关于社会主义“包围”的问题
    这所谓包围的命题其本质是双重的：（一）社会主义正在世界上迅速扩展，而资本主义则在普遍地陷于总危机中，（二）世界上社会主义愈加扩展，美帝国主义的地位就愈加削弱。假如美帝敢用战争的手段，妄想挽回这个必然发展的规律，武力所产生的结果只能加速资本主义的覆亡和社会主义的壮大。
    如因而得出结论说，因为世界上社会主义的发展削弱了美帝，以致美国资本家们会觉得自己处在无力作战的地位，这自然是一个严重的错误，恰恰相反，由于资本主义世界地位的削弱及美国外交政策的失败而显得日趋绝望，使得这些资本家们更加倾向于轻率的战争冒险了，目前那种危险的备战宣传就清楚地说明了这个。我们共产党很久以前就已明白了这一原则，我们已经几次在分析战争危机时说明了它。正如最近苏斯洛夫同志解释列宁的话所说：“历史经验告诉我们，帝国主义反动派的地位越加绝望，它就越加凶残：就更加有可能发动军事冒险。”（见《争取持久和平，争取人民民主》，一九四九年十二月二日）
    这一概念，跟白劳德一度企图硬加于我党的那一套说法完全相反。应用了他的美国例外论和美国资本主义的光荣论，他宣称美国资本主义已经变得如此强大，因此世界其他重要地区如欧洲、拉丁美洲、加拿大等，已经没有社会主义化的可能了。在这方面，我们只需要回想一下他给澳大利亚共产党的那一封可耻的信件就够了。这封信批评澳共同志们为“左倾分子”，因为他们给他们的国家提供了一个社会主义的远景。白劳德与他们争论说，澳大利亚在经济上是这样受制于美国，因而不得到华尔街的同意就不能采行社会主义，白劳德的政策是要使世界社会主义失败，使受美帝统治的世界资本主义永存。
    当然，在美国建立社会主义的责任完全落在美国工人阶级及其政治同盟者的肩头上。他们也一定会从发展中的世界社会主义那里得到强大的、继续增加着的支援。自然，如果有人从而得出结论说，所有美国工人只需要静坐，以待其他国家内社会主义工人们来替他们解决问题，这是十分愚蠢的。工人阶级从不会得出如此愚蠢的结论来的。恰恰相反，尽管美帝企图使美国人民和全世界相信它是强有力、不可战胜的，但世界社会主义的进展削弱了美帝的地位，认识了这一点，美国的工人阶级在它争取社会主义的日常斗争和最后决战中，是能够大大地加强，而不是减弱的。
    力量与暴力
    在审判中，大体说来，我们是正确地提出了阶级斗争中的力量和暴力的复杂问题的。在这件事上，我们特别遭遇到对我们的直接的控诉。很久以前，马克思就指出过，我们的地位的实质是：在历史上，统治阶级从来不肯让位给新兴的革命阶级，它不惜尽力使用任何武器来保存自己；第二，工人阶级及其同盟军，以共产党为首，必将强大得足以击败统治阶级的一切暴力，这是走向社会主义的道路上一定要遭遇到的。
    然而，只是重复地述说工人们一定要、并且一定能够用他们自己的优势的力量来击败雇主们的暴力，这在我们是不够的。阶级斗争中使用力量的全部问题，必须从当前的策略观点来考察，要依据最近大大变化了的阶级力量的对比，和资本主义在国内外的总危机的情况。
    当我们说，世界民主和社会主义的力量今天比制造战争的资本主义反动的力量更加强大时，这论点在国内及国际上，都包含着极重大的意义，特别是对于资产阶级的政权使用暴力和工人阶级对此种暴力所采取的态度。这就是说，民主的力量，现在有可能与必要去动员它们的优越的潜在力量，削弱资产阶级对人民使用暴力的能力。
    在我的小册子中，我指出，战争刚结束，在人民民主国家内就有一种广泛的、相当平和的、有秩序的向社会主义的进展。这是一个事实，而为什么这样一种情况可以存在（即使它是暂时的），唯一的理由是：因为一方面资产阶级的国家机器被战争和苏联军队的历史性的解放任务所摧毁了，另一方面，由于这次反希特勒的历史性的胜利，民主和社会主义的国家机器已经大大地增强了。在战后初期，反动派简直不能有效地、普遍地与欧洲的工人们作斗争，虽然它尽它的能力想这样做——制造了希腊内战，波兰暴动，罗马尼亚的叛乱等等。现在，形势大大改变了。在美帝国主义侵略性的领导下，欧洲反动派多少可以重新结集那已经被削弱了的力量，其结果，在法国、意大利、德国和中欧西欧诸国内，潜伏的内战的条件已被制造出来了。
    在强有力的共产党的领导下，形成阶级力量的新的对比的一个典型的例子是捷克。自然，捷克的形势对工人是很有利的。资本主义已经被战争大大的削弱了，而且已被推翻，共产党是强有力的，工人们具有革命的热情并且掌握着政权，而最重要的是靠近苏联。因此，工人和他们的同盟军是这样的强大和有组织，当一九四八年二月，反动势力在美帝国主义的鼓动下，进行有充分准备的反攻，想使捷克变成另外一个希腊的时候，强大的民主的社会主义势力，在共产党的领导之下，就在这个运动开始时，把它扼杀了，阻止了阴谋中的内战，并且迅速地转向了决定性的加强人民民主国家及其社会主义的纲领。其他国家的处境，当然不像捷克那样有利。他们必须和反革命的资产阶级更严重的冲突。虽然如此，预先削弱资产阶级的战斗力，以便在它对人民使用暴力的时候能较迅速地把它击败，这个一般原则仍然是适用的。
    资本家使用暴力的最显著的例子自然是表现在帝国主义战争中，表现在反革命的世界战争中的。现在的努力是要以民主和社会主义更强大的潜力来防止好战的资产阶级把世界投入一个新的战争，或是在他们真的这样干时，打败他们。没有一个马列主义者会怀疑的，资本主义者是想要发动第三次世界大战的，如果他们能够这样作的话。使他们不可能制造这个大灾难，乃是民主和社会主义力量的历史性的任务。假如我们能够说，世界战争并不是不可避免的，那只是因为现在人民的和平的潜在力量是坚强的，只要他们能够有力地共同地行动起来，便足以防止这样的一个战争。只有当民族的和国际的民主和社会主义的力量毅然负起责任，以维护和平时，尽管世界上还有腐朽的资本主义制度和猖獗的帝国主义反动势力，国际和平将要得到保证。
    总之：我党在审判中所遵循的主要路线，在政治上是健全而正确的。我们现在所要做的是勇敢的保卫这个路线，同时充分发展其理论上的形式与涵义。今天，我们的人民和世界所面临的最大威胁是战争危机。资本主义社会中的一切其他反动的政治倾向——各种的法西斯的倾向，对黑人的攻击，对工会的攻击，企图监禁我们的领袖和宣布共产党为非法——这一切都结合起来并且升到了顶点，使这个时代中的最大威胁更加恐怖，更加严重：这是美帝国主义为毁灭国际主义，为统治世界这种疯狂的企图而进行的另一次世界战争的危机。为了尽到我们全部责任，以击退这种严重的对文明与进步的威胁，让我们永远不要忘记工人阶级和人民的最高的需要是一个紧密团结的，有马列主义的理论与实践的坚固基础的，强有力的群众性的共产党，一个强大的共产党是成功的关键。
