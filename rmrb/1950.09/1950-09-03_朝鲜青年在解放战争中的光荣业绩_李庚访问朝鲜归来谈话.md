Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Li Geng, a member of the Chinese People's Delegation to Korea and Director of the Publications Committee of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, recently told our reporter in detail about the glorious achievements of Korean youth in their heroic struggle in the Liberation War:

　　Korean youth, united under the banner of the Korean Democratic Youth League, launched a widespread and enthusiastic movement to join the army after General Kim Il-sung issued a national mobilization order on June 26. On June 27, 2,650 of the 3,100 undergraduate and preparatory students at Kim Il-sung University signed up to join the army. Following this, 1,300 workers from the Heungnam Bungkung Youth Factory and 900 farmers from Sunchon County in South Pyongan Province collectively requested to go to the front lines to kill the enemy. By July 15, 849,000 young men and women had signed up to fight. The number of university and high school students who signed up accounted for over 90% of the total student population. Every day, the young men and women and members of the Democratic Youth League anxiously went to local Democratic Youth League offices and the Central Ministry of Education to request an early departure.

　　Members of the Democratic Youth League have achieved brilliant victories in the Liberation War. Among the 32 recipients of the honorary title of "Hero of the People of Korea," 26 were members of the Democratic Youth League. These include Kim Ki-ok, an air force hero who shot down ten American planes, Lee Dong-gyu, who shot down nine American planes, and Kim Kun-ok, who led four torpedo boats to sink an American heavy cruiser. In this wave of participation in the war, almost all of the cadres at the county-level (equivalent to a district in China) of the Democratic Youth League went to the front lines. In Kyongsong County, North Hamgyong Province alone, 800 chairmen of grassroots organizations went to the battlefield to kill the enemy.

　　In the rear, Korean youth threw themselves into the production front. Large numbers of young people went to mines and factories and actively produced to support the front lines with selfless labor. The production volume of young workers participating in the "double production movement" exceeded 150% of their pre-war production volume after the outbreak of the war. Sun Chang-mo, a model young worker at the Pyongyang No. 65 Factory, increased his production fivefold after the outbreak of the war.

　　Under the barbarous bombing of American planes, Korean youth organized themselves to repair damaged factories and railways and rescue injured compatriots with indomitable spirit. For example, Kim Nam-seop, a member of the Democratic Youth League in Wonsan, organized a protection team of 1,600 people. Under American bombing, they evacuated more than 10,000 bags of grain piled on the docks, rescued more than 40 seriously injured people, and repaired 23 damaged railway sections. Kim Sang-don, a member of the Democratic Youth League at the Nampo Shipyard, led all the workers to rescue a 2,000-ton ship from the flames caused by incendiary bombs. The government awarded him a third-class National Flag Medal for this. The movement to donate airplanes and tanks launched by the Korean Democratic Youth League has raised 60 million won in a short period of time; the Young Pioneers in South Hamhung Province alone donated two airplanes.

　　The reason why Korean youth participate so heroically and tenaciously in the struggle for the unification and independence of their country, as Hyun Jung-min, Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Youth League, pointed out, is the result of the contrast between the enslaved life under Japanese imperialism for 36 years and the happy life of the past five years after liberation; it is due to the correct education and leadership of the Korean Workers' Party; and it is also due to the encouragement of the revolutionary struggle spirit of Soviet and Chinese youth.

　　朝鲜青年在解放战争中的光荣业绩
    ——李庚访问朝鲜归来谈话
    【新华社一日讯】访问朝鲜返国的中国人民代表团团员、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会出版委员会主任委员李庚，顷对本社记者详述朝鲜青年在解放战争中英勇斗争的光荣业绩称：
    团结在朝鲜民主青年同盟旗帜之下的朝鲜青年，于六月二十六日金日成将军发出全国总动员命令以后，就展开了广泛热烈的参军运动。六月二十七日，金日成大学的三千一百名本预科学生中有二千六百五十人报名参军，继之兴南本宫青年工厂有一千三百名工人、平安南道顺天郡有九百名农民集体要求上前线杀敌。到七月十五日，已经有八十四万九千名男女青年报名要求参战。要求参军的大学和高中学生的人数已经占全体学生人数的百分之九十强。报名的男女青年和民青盟员每日焦急地到各地民青机关和中央教育省去请求早日出发。
    民青盟员在解放战争中获得了辉煌的胜利。在三十二位获得“朝鲜人民英雄”光荣称号的受勋者当中，有二十六位是民青盟员。其中包括击落美机十架的空军英雄金基玉，击落美机九架的李东奎，和率领四艘鱼雷艇击沉美国重巡洋舰的金君沃。在这参战的浪涛中，民青的各地面一级（相当中国的区）的干部几乎全部上了前线，只咸镜北道镜城郡就有八百名基层组织的委员长到战场上去杀敌。
    在后方，朝鲜青年投入了生产战线，大批青年走进了矿山和工场，并且以忘我的劳动积极生产，支援前线。参加生产“倍加运动”的青年工人，在战争爆发后每人的生产量都超过战前生产量的百分之一百五十。平壤第六十五号工厂的模范青年工人孙昌模在战争爆发后生产量达到战前的五倍。
    在美国飞机野蛮地轰炸下，朝鲜青年纷纷组织起来，以不屈不挠的精神去修复被破坏的工厂和铁路，抢救受伤的同胞。例如元山的民青盟员金南燮组织了一千六百人的防护队，在美机的轰炸下疏散了堆积在码头上的一万多包粮食，救出重伤者四十余人，修复二十三处被破坏的铁路。南浦造船厂的民青盟员金相敦，在燃烧弹引起的烈火中，率领全体工人救出二千吨的轮船。政府为此颁发给他一枚三级国旗勋章。朝鲜民主青年同盟所发起的捐献飞机坦克运动，在短期内已经募集了六千万元的基金；仅仅咸兴南道的少年团就捐献了两架飞机。
    朝鲜青年之所以如此英勇顽强地参加为争取祖国的统一、独立的斗争，正如北朝鲜民主青年同盟委员长玄正民所指出的，这是三十六年在日本帝国主义统治下的奴役生活和解放后五年来幸福生活的对比的结果；是由于朝鲜劳动党的教育和领导的正确；也是由于苏联青年和中国青年革命斗争精神的鼓舞。
