Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 31st (TASS dispatch): The USSR Council of Ministers has recently issued a decision on the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station on the Volga River and the implementation of irrigation and water diversion to the Caspian Lowlands.

The decision points out that the construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station and the adoption of corresponding measures are of great national economic importance for ensuring the completion of the following tasks: improving the natural conditions of the Caspian Lowlands, one of the major sources of dry winds in the Volga Basin; controlling the desert and semi-desert areas north of the Caspian Sea to extensively develop animal husbandry and agriculture; irrigating the areas south of the Volga River to develop intensive and stable cultivation work; diverting water to irrigate the Sarpinsky Lowlands, the Black Earth Region, and the Nogai Steppe, to extensively develop animal husbandry and plant forests of industrial significance and forests to defend against dry wind erosion; increasing the power supply to the central states, the Volga Basin states, and the central Black Earth Region; improving navigation conditions in the lower reaches of the Volga River.

To this end, the USSR Council of Ministers has decided to commence construction of the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station from 1951 to 1956. The power station will have a generating capacity of 1.7 million kilowatts, and the power generation will be 10 billion kilowatt-hours in years of normal water levels. In order to carry out all construction matters, the Soviet government has decided to establish the "Stalingrad Hydroelectric Power Station Construction Bureau" and has instructed the Hydroelectric Power Station Design Bureau to carry out all design, measurement, and research work related to the construction.

The USSR Council of Ministers has decided to build irrigation systems in the Volga River region, the Caspian Lowlands, the Sarpinsky Lowlands, the Black Earth Region, and the Nogai Steppe to use electric power to divert water to irrigate an area of 13 million hectares of land, and has instructed the Ministry of Electricity to draft a plan for the Stalingrad Power Station transmission network, and the Ministry of Agriculture to conduct measurements, draft plans, and carry out canal construction projects.

The decision points out that in order to carry out afforestation and organize large-scale ranches in the above-mentioned irrigated areas for large-scale development of livestock breeding, the USSR Council of Ministers has instructed the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of State Farms, in conjunction with the USSR Academy of Sciences and the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, to formulate and implement plans for afforestation, land reclamation, and livestock development. The Central Protective Forest Planting Bureau is responsible for providing guidance and unified coordination in the preparation of afforestation and reclamation plans.

    兴建斯大林格勒发电站     
    实行灌溉及引水至里海低地
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科八月三十一日讯：苏联部长会议顷发布关于在伏尔加河畔建造斯大林格勒水力发电站、实行灌溉及引水至里海低地的决定。
    决定指出：建造斯大林格勒水力发电站并采取多项相应的措施，对于确保下列各项任务的完成，具有极大的全国经济重要性：改善伏尔加流域的干风的重大来源地之一——里海低地的自然条件；控制里海以北的沙漠地带与半沙漠地带，以广泛发展牧畜业与农业；灌溉伏尔加河以南各地区，以便发展精深与稳定的耕种工作：引水灌溉萨尔宾斯克低地、黑土地带和诺加伊斯克草原等地，以广泛发展畜牧业并栽植具有工业意义的森林和防御干风侵袭的森林；增加中央各州、伏尔加流域各州及中央黑土地带各州的电力供应；改良伏尔加河下流各地的航行条件。
    苏联部长会议为此特决定于一九五一——一九五六年兴工建造斯大林格勒水力发电站。该发电站将具有发电能力一百七十万千瓦，在水位正常的年份中发电量将为一百亿千瓦时。为了执行一切建设事宜，苏联政府决定成立“斯大林格勒水力发电站建设处”，并责成水力发电站设计处进行一切与建设有关的设计、测量及研究工作。
    苏联部长会议决定建造伏尔加河地区、里海低地、萨尔宾斯克低地，黑土地带与诺加伊斯克草原等地的灌溉系统，以利用电力引水灌溉面积达一千三百万公顷的土地，并责成电力部草拟斯大林格勒发电站输电网计划，责成农业部进行测量，草拟计划及进行水渠建筑工程。
    决定指出：为要在以上各灌溉地区进行造林和组织大牧场以大规模发展牲畜饲养工作，苏联部长会议责成林业部，农业部及国营农场部，会同苏联科学院及全苏列宁农业科学院，制订造林、开垦及发展牲畜业的方案并付诸施行，中央防护林植造局负责在编制造林及开垦计划方面进行指导与统一调度。
