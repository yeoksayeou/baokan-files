Harbin Northeast First Cement Plant Workers
    Complete Annual Production Tasks and Strive to Exceed Them
    [This newspaper dispatch] (By our correspondent Liu Jianrong) The entire workforce of the Harbin Northeast First Cement Plant is actively engaged in production and victoriously completed their annual cement production task on September 16th. They are now striving to exceed production targets as a gift to celebrate National Day. At a celebration meeting on the 19th, all employees decided to write a letter to Chairman Mao to report the good news. The original letter is as follows:

    Respected Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government:
    We, the entire workforce, extend our warm greetings to you! With our labor enthusiasm, our thousand-plus employees victoriously completed the entire state-assigned task for the year at 2:00 PM on the 16th of this month. All employees are delighted to report this good news to you. We sincerely thank the Chinese Communist Party and your wise leadership. All employees are striving to exceed production as a gift to welcome the first National Day. We will not be arrogant and are full of confidence to exceed the annual task by 20,000 tons before November 15th. We will use practical actions to protest the hatred of American planes invading our country's airspace, killing and injuring our compatriots, support the People's Liberation Army to quickly liberate Taiwan, and support the Korean People's Army to completely crush the aggression of American imperialism. We wish you eternal health!
            The entire workforce of the Northeast First Cement Plant
              September 20th
