Skilled Lumberjack Liu Jingui

Lumberjack Liu Jingui reduced the height of tree stumps (the remaining tree roots after felling) from over thirty centimeters to under five centimeters. In 1949, his personal lumber production increased the country's wealth by 240 million Northeast currency units.

　　Now He Is Working for Himself

Liu Jingui is an experienced worker in the Nancha forest area with ten years of logging experience. After liberation, he worked actively and diligently. In 1948, during timber rafting on the Yichun River, when the union's work had not yet begun, some workers still "loafed on the job" as they had when the Japanese devils were present, going into the woods to sleep during work hours. Liu Jingui persuaded them, "Now we are working for ourselves, so we should work properly and not wait for the site personnel to criticize us before we work." He took the lead in enduring hardship. In the past few years of timber rafting, he was always indispensable for picking up the head logs and working on the top stacks. He was also always relied on to solve problems encountered during operations. Therefore, Liu Jingui was repeatedly selected as a model worker and honorably became a member of the Communist Party.

Responding to the call to lower tree stumps, he knelt to saw and sat on the ice to saw, constantly researching and improving.

Last winter, the Yichun Forestry Bureau's administration and union called for learning from the Soviet Union's advanced logging experience: "Reduce tree stumps (the remaining tree roots after felling) to no more than thirty centimeters, retain mother trees, and utilize treetop wood." Some backward workers said behind their backs: "Felling more trees earns money; lowering the tree stumps won't get us paid." Liu Jingui, however, was the first to respond to the call. He made the greatest determination and constantly researched and improved. He used a curved-handled saw alone, kneeling on one leg to saw, reducing the tree stump height to twenty centimeters, but he was not satisfied with this. He also cleared all the snow around the tree and sat on the ground to saw. Later, he also carried a waist axe, first chopping at the base of the tree, kneeling and sticking close to the tree's base to saw. In this way, little by little, the height was reduced from twenty centimeters to fifteen centimeters, and then to below five centimeters. In 1949 alone, because he reduced tree stumps and utilized treetop wood, he increased the country's timber supply by sixty cubic meters. To try his best to reduce the height of the stumps, he had to work much harder while felling the trees. Once, he was sawing a tree when the group leader saw him sweating profusely from the side and said to him: "Liu Jingui, why are you so silly? It's so much more difficult to saw close to the tree roots! Why bother with the hardship?" Liu Jingui said: "Group leader, you are a leading cadre, you should be ahead of others in everything; if you don't take the lead, why are you saying discouraging things when others are working? If the leader doesn't do it, others will be even less likely to reach out. Think about it, weren't you also a suffering worker in the past? Where did your happy life come from? Can you be worthy of the Communist Party leading us to turn ourselves around with such remarks?" These words struck the group leader's heart. He realized his mistake and expressed his willingness to learn from Liu Jingui.

Improved working methods, reduced casualties, all lumberjacks in Northeast China learn from him

Liu Jingui also patiently studied and improved working methods, reducing casualties. Casualties in logging operations were high, mainly due to poor working methods. Liu Jingui improved the one-way felling method, which is to look at which direction is appropriate for the tree to fall before felling, put the lower saw cut on the side of the intended fall direction, and then use the saw to pull out a piece about four centimeters thick from the "lower saw cut," and then pull the "upper saw cut." This way, the tree falls in the intended direction. This one-way felling method not only changed the past situation where trees fell randomly due to the inability of the fellers to control them, greatly reduced casualties, made it easier to clear passages, and improved the timber transportation rate and production rate. After this method spread, it was quickly adopted by lumberjacks in various forest areas in Northeast China, and the slogan "Learn from Liu Jingui" was shouted everywhere.

In his work, Liu Jingui always tried not to let even a branch of the mother tree or young tree be touched. He was careful and patient in his work and did more than the average worker. He did very well in the work that others were unwilling to do.

Liu Jingui and his model team

In 1949, at the model worker conference, Liu Jingui proposed to resolutely maintain the honorable title of permanent model worker. In this year's timber rafting operation, under his leadership, their team launched assaults everywhere. Stacks that others could not dismantle were opened as soon as they arrived. Liu Jingui is the team leader, and he is very good at using democratic methods to solve problems in the operation. When dismantling stacks during rafting, he first asked the team members to look around the stack, then held a temporary small meeting to discuss how to dismantle it, and then distributed the work. He let others do the safe and easy-to-dismantle places, and he personally took care of the dangerous and difficult places. Under his inspiration and cultivation, the team became a model team, and sixteen workers all became technicians, with eight being selected as rafting models. During breaks, he discussed technology with his co-workers and educated everyone to work hard. He said: "We must work hard and strive to learn culture. I hope we are all model workers and keep the glory of model workers."

### 森林采伐能手刘金贵

　　森林采伐能手刘金贵
    伐木工人刘金贵，使伐根（伐剩的树根）由三十公分以上降低到五公分以下。一九四九年度他个人伐木所增益的国家财富达东北币二万四千万元。
        现在是给自己干活了
    刘金贵是南岔林区的老工人，有十年的采伐经验。解放后工作积极，任劳任怨。一九四八年在伊春河流送木材，当时工会的工作尚未开展，一部分工人还像日本鬼子在时一样“磨洋工”，工作时跑到树林里睡觉。刘金贵就说服他们：“现在是给我们自己干活了，那我们就应该干得像个样，不能等现场员来批评再干。”他吃苦在前，过去几年在流送工作中，挑头子、上么垛，总少不了他，作业遇到了困难时，也总依靠他来解决。因此刘金贵曾几次被选为模范。并光荣的成为共产党员。
    响应降低伐根的号召，他拉锯时跪着拉，坐在冰地上拉，不断研究改进。
    去年冬天伊春林务所的行政及工会号召学习苏联的先进采伐经验：“降低伐根（伐剩的树根）不超过三十公分，留母树和利用梢头木”。有些落后的工人背后说：“多伐树能挣钱，树槎子放低了没人给钱。”刘金贵却首先响应号召，他下了最大的决心，不断地研究改进。他一个人拉着弯把子锯，跪着一条腿拉，伐根降低到二十公分，但他并不以此为满足。他又把树周围的雪都清理干净，坐在地上拉。后来他又带着一把腰斧，先把树脚砍一下，跪贴在树脚拉，这样一次一次的，由二十公分降到十五公分，又降到了五公分以下。单一九四九年一年中，由于他减低伐根，利用梢头木，就为国家增加木料六十立方公尺。为了竭力降低伐根，采伐时就艰难多了。有一次他正在拉树，大组长从旁看到刘金贵累的直流汗，却向他说：“刘金贵你怎么这么傻呢？贴着树根拉多费劲啊！何必挨那个累呢？”刘金贵说：“大组长，你是领导干部，有什么事应该走在别人前面；你不带头就罢了，为什么人家别人干你还说泄气话呢？领头人不干，别人更不能伸手了。你想一想，过去你不也是受苦的工人吗？现在你的幸福生活是那里来的，你这样的说法，能够对得起共产党领导咱翻身吗？”一翻话说到大组长心上，他认识了自己的错误，表示愿意向刘金贵学习。
    改进作业方法，减少伤亡，全东北伐木工人向他学习
    刘金贵又耐心钻研改进了作业方法，减少了伤亡事故。采伐作业的伤亡很大，主要原因是作业方法不好。刘金贵改进了一面倒的作业方法，就是在放树之前，看看树向那边倒合适，就把下锯口放在倒向的一方面，另外用锯把“下锯口”抽出约四公分厚的一个片，然后再拉“上锯口”，这样树就倒在预定的方向。这个一面倒的作业方法，除改变了过去因采伐者不能控制，致使树木乱倒的情形，大大减少了伤亡事故，容易整理通道，提高了木材的运输率和生产率，这个方法传出后，很快的被东北各个林区的采伐工人所采用，处处喊出了向刘金贵学习的口号。
    刘金贵在工作中，对母树幼树总想法连一个树枝不让他碰掉，他工作细心耐心，比一般工友干得多。别人不愿意干的活他干得非常好。
    刘金贵和他的模范组
    一九四九年刘金贵在劳模大会上，提出坚决保持永久光荣模范称号。在今年流送作业中，他们小组在他的领导下，到处突击，别人拆不了的垛他们一到就拆开了。刘金贵是小组长，他很会用民主的方式解决作业中的问题。在流送拆垛的时候，他先叫组员们围着垛看一看，再开一个临时小会，互相研究如何拆法，然后支配工作，凡是安全好拆的地方他都让别人去干，危险困难的地方，他亲自下手。小组在他的启发培养之下，成为模范小组，十六个工友都成为技术工人，有八名被选为流送模范。在休息时，他就和工友们研究技术，教育大家好好工作，他说：“咱们要好好工作，努力学习文化，我希望咱们都是劳模，并把劳模的光荣保持下去。”
