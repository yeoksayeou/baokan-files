　　Truman Delivers Speech
    Again Quibbling for US Aggression Against Korea but Exposing Plans to Expand the War
    [Xinhua News Agency, 7th] US President Truman delivered a lengthy radio address on the evening of September 1st, once again defending the US government's aggressive war in Korea and plans to further expand the war.
    Since Matthews and MacArthur publicly announced the US government's undeclared, yet actually practiced, conspiracy to expand the war of aggression and to seize our Taiwan, which aroused greater anger around the world towards American aggression, the US government, attempting to cover up this conspiracy, has been extremely flustered and embarrassed. Although the Truman administration ordered MacArthur to retract his statement and denied that Matthews represented the government's views, it still felt apprehensive and uneasy. This is the reason why Truman could not help but reappear and lie again.
    In his speech, Truman began his sophistry with flowery words such as "peace" and "freedom." Regarding the US launching of the war of aggression against Korea and the criminal act of openly undermining peace, Truman said: This is the US "once again engaging in the time-honored struggle for human freedom." Despite the fact that the Korean people have never threatened the lives of Americans, the US government has sent troops thousands of miles away to Korea, using airplanes and artillery to try to force the Korean people to live and develop according to their own wishes, placing the entire Korea under the terror of barbaric warfare. Yet, Truman wants to use the most shameless lies to make people believe: "What is endangered is the free way of life (which should be read as the American imperialist way of enslaving the Asian people)." Truman said: The US government adheres to its "promise" to support the United Nations, namely: "to achieve peace and security through this world organization"; and said: "Our coming out two months ago to support the United Nations' action in Korea is adhering to our promise." However, as everyone knows, the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet government's war of aggression against North Korea was planned by the United States. After the outbreak of the war, the United States first carried out armed intervention and then forced the United Nations to support its aggressive actions in Korea.
    Although Truman hypocritically declared: "We (referring to the United States) do not want Taiwan or any part of Asia for ourselves," he immediately exposed the US conspiracy of aggression against Taiwan. He described Taiwan, which has long been Chinese territory, as a "disputed territory" and absurdly believed that the future of Taiwan "should be resolved by international action."
    Truman said maliciously: "We particularly hope that the Chinese people will not be deceived or forced to fight against the United Nations and against the American people. The American people have always been and still are their 'friends'." Everyone knows that the Chinese people have always respected the United Nations Charter and the friendship of the American people, but the Chinese people do not need the "friendship" of American aggressors; moreover, the Chinese people have expressed their firm will to resolutely strike at any aggressive actions of American imperialists in the movement against American aggression in Taiwan and Korea and in the protests against the US air force's invasion of our Northeast.
    Truman tried to make people believe that the US "does not want the Korean war to be expanded into a general war" and "does not believe in aggression or preemptive wars." However, in the very same speech, Truman exposed the US's full-scale conspiracy to expand the war. Truman said: The US government is planning to double the size of the US military, increasing it to three million, "and may need to increase it further." Truman also said: "In addition to increasing the size of our armed forces, we must rapidly increase the production of guns, tanks, airplanes, and other military equipment. We also need to increase the accumulation of essential materials, expand the capacity of industrial production of military supplies, and expand the supply of resources to meet our current needs." To this end, Truman demanded that the American people must "change the way they live and work," "give up many things they enjoy," "work harder and longer," and "impose some restraints on themselves." From this, people can see more clearly that the American liars, who are full of rhetoric about "peace" and "freedom," are precisely the ferocious robbers who are trying their best to expand their aggressive adventures.

### 杜鲁门发表演说  再度为美国侵朝诡辩却又暴露了扩大战争的计划

　　杜鲁门发表演说
    再度为美国侵朝诡辩却又暴露了扩大战争的计划
    【新华社七日讯】美国总统杜鲁门于九月一日晚发表冗长的广播演说，再次为美国政府在朝鲜进行的侵略战争和进一步扩大战争的计划辩护。
    自从马休斯和麦克阿瑟公开宣布了美国政府正在实际进行而没有宣布的扩大侵略战争和侵占我台湾的阴谋计划，从而引起全世界人民对美国侵略行为更大的愤怒以后，力图掩饰这一阴谋计划的美国政府极为慌乱和狼狈。杜鲁门政府虽经下令麦克阿瑟撤回其声明并否认马休斯代表政府的意见，但仍感惶恐不安。这就是杜鲁门不能不再次抛头露面出来撒谎的原因。
    杜鲁门在其演说中，用“和平”“自由”等花言巧语开始他的诡辩。关于美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争和公开破坏和平的犯罪行为，杜鲁门说：这是美国“再一次从事于历史悠久的为人类自由的斗争”。尽管事实是：朝鲜人民从未威胁过美国人的生活，而美国政府却把军队派到几千里以外的朝鲜去，以飞机、大炮力图压服朝鲜人民按照自己的方式生活和发展的愿望，把整个朝鲜置于野蛮战争的恐怖之下，可是，杜鲁门却想用最无耻的谎言硬要人们相信：“受到危险的是自由的生活方式（应读作美帝国主义的奴役亚洲人民的方式）”。杜鲁门说：美国政府信守其支持联合国的“诺言”，即：“要通过这个世界机构来获致和平与安全”：并且说：“我们两个月前出而支持联合国在朝鲜的行动，是信守我们的诺言的。”但是，尽人皆知，南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府发动的侵犯北朝鲜的战争是美国策划的，曾在战争爆发后，美国就首先实行武装干涉，然后又迫使联合国支持其在朝鲜的侵略行动。
    尽管杜鲁门虚伪地宣告：“我们（指美国）并不要台湾或亚洲任何那一部分为自己的”，但他马上又暴露了美国对台湾的侵略阴谋，他把早已是中国领土的台湾说成是“争议的领土”，并荒谬地认为台湾的将来“应该由国际行动来解决”。
    杜鲁门恶毒地说：“我们特别希望中国人民不会被欺蒙或者被强迫作战反对联合国和反对美国人民。美国人民一直是而且现在仍是他们的‘友人’。”谁都知道中国人民历来尊重联合国宪章及美国人民的友谊的，但是中国人民不需要美国侵略者的“友谊”；而且，中国人民已在反对美国侵略台湾朝鲜运动中，在反对美国空军侵犯我东北的抗议中，表示了坚决打击美国帝国主义者任何侵略行动的钢铁的意志。
    杜鲁门力图使人们相信美国“并不要朝鲜战事扩大为一次普遍的战争”，“并不相信侵略或先发制人的战争”。可是，就在他的同一篇演说中，杜鲁门却又暴露了美国全力扩大战争的阴谋计划。杜鲁门说：美国政府正计划把美国军队扩大一倍，增至三百万人，“并且可能还需要增加”。杜鲁门又说：“除了增加我们武装力量的数量外，我们必须急遽提高枪炮、坦克、飞机及其他军事装备的生产。我们并且需要增加必需物资的积蓄，扩大工业生产军需品的能力，扩大资源供应以满足我们当前的需要。”为此，杜鲁门要求美国人民必须“改变生活和工作方式”，“放弃许多享受的东西”，“工作得更努力，更长久”，并且“对自己加以某些约束”。人们从这里可以更清楚地看出：满口宣扬什么“和平”“自由”的美国骗子，正是极力企图扩大侵略冒险的凶恶强盗。
