　　A Man Who Conquers Difficulties
　　——Labor Hero Liu Maoyou of the Lüda District and the Story of Protecting the Great Kiln
　　Tian Liu

　　No matter how great the difficulty, as long as you are determined to overcome it, "difficulty" is no longer a difficulty.

　　Liu Maoyou, the melting section chief of the Dalian Glass Factory—an old worker with 26 years of service who was promoted to the head of the factory's melting section after liberation—is just such a person. Because he faced difficulties and bravely overcame them, solving major technical problems in glass production, the factory's production volume in six months of 1949 equaled 163% of the highest annual output during the Japanese occupation (1943), creating the miracle of completing the annual plan in half a year. Because he firmly stood at the forefront of solving difficulties, the factory exceeded its 1950 production plan on August 28th of this year, creating enormous wealth for the country.

　(1)

　　To understand how Liu Maoyou created such great production achievements, one must first understand what kind of person Liu Maoyou is.

　　Liu Maoyou was born into a tenant farmer's family. At the age of thirteen, he worked for landlords, chopped firewood, and fished at sea. The sea had big waves and small boats. The sea breeze often tossed the small boat onto the crest of the waves and then suddenly threw it down into the whirlpools. The teenagers lived on the edge of death day and night. He fished at sea until he was twenty-four, but his stomach wasn't full. Helpless, he went to work as a loader for the great kiln at the glass factory (then the Japanese-owned "Changguang Glass Co., Ltd."). The great kiln was like a pot of fire, making him dizzy. Especially when repairing the kiln, the Japanese forced them to repair it before the "glass glaze" had cooled down, scalding his hands and face purple and green. Repairing the kiln once was like having a sickness, with his whole body shedding a layer of skin.

　　The hardships of life made his body thinner and thinner. After twenty years in the factory, he was just a skeleton. But the disastrous life could not wear down his ambition. Thirty years of hardship cultivated his steel character of never succumbing to any difficulty.

　　In 1945, the Soviet army liberated Lüda, and Liu Maoyou, like everyone else, turned over from being enslaved by imperialism. From then on, Lao Liu began to live a "human life" and learned what it meant to be a human. Because he worked actively and produced diligently after liberation, he was promoted to the head of the factory's melting section in early 1947. Liu Maoyou, who had been trampled underfoot in the old society, never dreamed that such a day would come. He deeply realized that only the Soviet Union could help all countries invaded by imperialism to achieve liberation; only the Communist Party could lift up the oppressed. His class consciousness grew day by day. In 1948, he gloriously joined the Communist Party. From then on, Lao Liu became more active, taking the lead in everything and working tirelessly.

　　The great kiln is the heart of the glass factory, and it cannot stop beating for even a second. After painstaking research, Liu Maoyou finally extended the life of the great kiln and successfully defended it for the first time.

　　In February 1949, all the workers of the Dalian Glass Factory became anxious about a major issue. According to its usage period, the melting kiln should have been overhauled on February 15th. Checking the condition of the great kiln, it really needed to be repaired. The great kiln, which was being impacted and eroded by the molten glass liquor emitting white light 24 hours a day, had been eroded into a deep groove at the point of contact with the molten glass liquid's level. Some of the 300 mm thick iron bricks (Kroha bricks) were only 50 mm thick. If they continued to be used, the 1400-1500 degree molten glass liquid would break through the wall—then everything would be unimaginable.

　　Everyone in the factory was worried. Liu Maoyou, a 26-year-old veteran worker who was promoted to the head of the melting section after liberation, was even more restless. He knew better than anyone that the melting kiln was the heart of the glass factory, and it couldn't stop beating for even a second. If the kiln stopped, the whole factory couldn't produce. Repair it immediately—but the refractory bricks weren't fully prepared, and Kroha bricks weren't available at all. Stop work and wait for kiln repair materials—but the production plan wouldn't be completed. The factory had become the state's and the workers' own enterprise, so who was willing to do that? The only way out was to extend the kiln's life. The factory director called Lao Liu five or six times in seven or eight days, "Lao Liu, what do you think?" The director asked whenever he saw Lao Liu, "Can you think of a way to extend the kiln's life?" The Party branch secretary also mobilized everyone every day: "Give play to the creativity of the working class, everyone think of a way, there are no difficulties that Communist Party members can't overcome." The rationalization proposal committee, led by the Soviet engineer and the Chinese deputy director, mobilized all employees, especially experienced veteran technicians, to focus on studying this urgent problem. The sense of responsibility to the people's enterprise that Party education had cultivated in Lao Liu's heart strengthened his steel will, which he had developed in thirty years of fighting difficulties. With the Party's encouragement and administrative support, Lao Liu was determined to overcome this difficulty.

　　"Difficulty?" Lao Liu said, "We have to think of ways to solve difficulties!"

　　In those days, he was simply obsessed. He spent all day pacing around the great kiln, walking back and forth, thinking about how to extend its life. One day, he came back from work and thought about it until after midnight. Just as he was racking his brains, he suddenly remembered his past experience fishing at sea: Once, he was sailing along the coast after the tide had gone out, and he saw a deep groove on the shore where it usually met the sea. The place where the seawater couldn't reach was naturally intact, and even the place that was submerged by the seawater all day long had little erosion—this enlightened Lao Liu. Wasn't the situation of the great kiln exactly like this? Every year during kiln repairs, there was a very deep groove where it connected with the molten glass liquid's level. "Maybe the problem lies in this 'level,'" Lao Liu thought, "If we lower the level of the molten glass liquid a bit and expose the eroded area, we can definitely extend the kiln's life." The next morning, he rushed to the factory and told the director, who immediately gave him enthusiastic encouragement. Engineering and technical personnel also provided scientific analysis and enlightenment, saying that his rational proposal was "completely scientific." Lao Liu's confidence greatly increased, and with administrative approval, he began to implement it. He first appropriately lowered the molten glass liquid, preventing it from further eroding the already thin area, eliminating the burden on the weak part of the kiln wall. However, the molten glass liquid was not seawater after all. Although lowering the molten glass liquid's level eliminated the direct impact on the weak part of the kiln wall, the high heat of 1400-1500 degrees still continued to erode the great kiln. So he came up with a rational proposal to reduce the furnace's high-heat erosion, breaking the old "specifications" of the air ducts installed by the Japanese and adding two large air ducts, increasing the wind force, and rapidly cooling the eroded iron bricks, reducing the erosion of the high heat. In this way, the great kiln was preserved. The workers cheered and increased production. In April, when the CPC Lüda Party was made public, the working class met its own political party and was extremely excited, sparking a heated "production competition to support the Party." All the workers in the factory wanted to complete the annual task before "July 1st" as a gift to their Party and beloved leader Chairman Mao. Everyone was working hard: Workers came to their posts three minutes before their shifts to familiarize themselves with the previous shift's work situation and machine conditions so that they could take over immediately and continue production when the time came. The phenomenon of workers being absent from work without reason decreased to one in a thousand; the plate-making department solved a series of technical problems caused by the increased distance between the molten glass liquid and the plate-making process after lowering the liquid level. Precisely at eight o'clock on the morning of "July 1st," when the fiery red sun rose from the east, the glass factory completed its annual production plan, earning the factory the glorious title of "Lüda First-Class Model Factory." Lao Liu was also named a "Lüda Industrial Labor Hero." His method of protecting the great kiln and extending its life radiated special brilliance in China's glass industry construction. The technical value and economic value generated by this improvement are immeasurable.

　　The entire factory of more than a thousand workers celebrated the Party's birthday amid the sound of production victories, a scene of boiling emotion and jubilation. All the workers signed a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting the unprecedented production achievements created by the liberated working class under the leadership of the Party in the 25 years since the factory was built. And the great kiln—it remained unharmed. The fiery red molten glass liquid flowed smoothly into the pots for drawing glass, quickly drawing out clean and bright glass sheets. So Liu Maoyou put forward a new guarantee to extend the use of the great kiln to the "September 3rd" victory day of the Soviet Red Army's liberation of Lüda. What an inspiring slogan! On that day, the Lüda working class was forever freed from the shackles of slavery and became the masters of their own destiny. All the workers plunged into a new production upsurge, until the fire was officially stopped on September 15th.

　　Although Liu Maoyou was promoted to the head of the melting section after liberation, he never stopped working for a single day. He was always working in the most difficult and critical positions in production. After the great kiln was shut down on September 15th, there was another tense and enthusiastic struggle. Liu Maoyou personally led a kiln repair team of six hundred shock troops, working hard every day. On the third day after the fire was stopped, the kiln was still fiery hot, and clothes would catch fire at the slightest touch, but the workers were unwilling to wait any longer. Although Lao Liu was already forty-eight years old, he worked like a young man in his twenties, taking off his clothes and jumping into the kiln to repair it. The workers followed him one by one. The heat inside the kiln was high, and the morale of Lao Liu and the workers was even higher. They completed the 22-day kiln repair plan in 14 days and started producing glass again in 33 days, 15 days ahead of the original plan. In the era of Japanese rule, it took at least 76 days to repair a great kiln!

　(3)

　　Liu Maoyou mobilized all the workers in the workshop to attack the difficulties and preserve the great kiln once again.

　　This time, all the old bricks were used for repairing the great kiln. It is conceivable that the old bricks have inconsistent specifications, poor quality, and are prone to problems, but what kind of problems will occur, and where they will occur is unimaginable. In order to successfully complete this year’s (1950) production plan, which is 45% higher than in 1949, Lao Liu took even more careful care of the great kiln. Since the day the great kiln was repaired and ignited on September 29, 1949, every morning when he came to the factory, he would first go to the front and back of the kiln and look around carefully, and finally stop at the kiln door and squat there to carefully observe it. Last year, in order to facilitate the entry and exit of the feeding machine, and based on Soviet experience, the kiln door was changed from the original 1.8 meters to 5 meters wide. This could save labor for the workers when loading materials into the kiln, and the materials could be spread more evenly and melt thoroughly. Who knew that the materials were old and of poor quality. After ignition, as the temperature increased, a crack was pressed open in the suspended insertion brick of the kiln door, and at the same time, it was continuously impacted by the high heat of 1400-1500 degree gas. By the end of the year, two-thirds of the suspended insertion brick had been eroded. It wouldn't burn for long - at most until May this year (1950) it would be completely eroded. Then the cast steel (i.e. the outer skin) would be exposed, and the cast steel would melt in less than eight hours, causing the entire front face of the great kiln to collapse. If that were to happen, there would be no other way but to stop the fire and repair the kiln. The danger of stopping production was approaching day by day, and Liu Maoyou's heart was also getting heavier and heavier. He squatted at the kiln door all day long, staring at it, pondering, distracted, thinking about a solution. "Is there really no solution?" Lao Liu often muttered to himself: "Is it impossible to achieve the Party's guarantee of not repairing the kiln for the whole year and completing and exceeding the task that is half as high as in 1949?"

　　Liu Maoyou, this victor who has fought through difficulties, this veteran worker with 26 years of rich glass production experience, this manager of people's enterprises who was promoted to the head of the melting section after liberation and matured over the years with the help of the Party's education and advanced Soviet experience, was not only not frightened by the difficulties, but more determined to advance into the difficulties. Not only did he focus on studying ways to conquer the difficulties himself, but he also used Soviet experience to convene a workshop meeting, mobilizing all the workers in the workshop to solve this difficulty. Under the leadership of Lao Liu, the increasingly awakened workers came up with many solutions! Some people said to build it up with bricks to hold the cast steel plate so that it would not collapse; some people said to add a water jacket to the outside of the cast steel to reduce the temperature so that it would not melt… How could this work? The inside of the kiln is agitated with molten glass liquid, and the bricks have no "roots" when stacked up, so how can it be stable? Adding a water jacket is even worse. What kind of water jacket can withstand a high temperature of 1400-1500 degrees?

　　Lao Liu was not discouraged, and neither was everyone else. Everyone racked their brains thinking about various solutions. Finally, Lao Liu came up with a way to block the eroded area of the suspended insertion bricks with bricks. This would prevent the suspended insertion bricks from being burned and exposing the cast steel. New bricks could be replaced if the blocking bricks were damaged. When it was discussed at the workshop meeting, everyone said this method was good, so they started to experiment. At first, they used red refractory bricks for the experiment, but this kind of brick was not resistant to burning, so they changed to using silica bricks for the experiment. It was proved that it could last for three months, so it was decided to embed silica bricks and add a flat air duct to reduce erosion. After all the experiments were completed, it took a lot of effort to embed the silica bricks inside. It was impossible to hold the bricks with your hands to embed them inside due to the high temperature inside the furnace. The workers used iron wire to wrap the bricks, first handing the bricks into the kiln through the small kiln door, with one person pulling the iron wire and others moving it in. Although the workers were all sweating profusely from the heat, this difficulty was finally conquered by them, ensuring the life of the great kiln's front face and protecting the kiln door.

　　Things often go smoothly once a breakthrough is made. Because Lao Liu created a new record in protecting the great kiln, the factory created 83 new records in various aspects one after another in eight months. Ninety-one percent of the employees were involved in the new record movement. These new records converged, and 91% of the employees twisted into one force, which became a new record for the entire factory - on August 28th, the annual production plan for 1950 was exceeded, the cost was reduced by 7.8%, and the percentage of first-class products was increased to 68% (the plan was 30%), and the production rate increased by 148% compared with the highest period of Japanese rule (1943).

　　No matter how great the difficulty, as long as you are determined to overcome it, difficulty is no longer a difficulty. Liu Maoyou, the melting section chief of the Dalian Glass Factory, is such a person. Because he bravely fought against difficulties, the factory completed its annual task in half a year in 1949; because he always stood at the forefront of solving difficulties, the factory exceeded its annual plan for 1950 on August 28th, creating huge wealth for the country and solving major technical problems in the construction of China's glass industry.

　　征服困难的人
    ——旅大区劳动英雄刘茂有保卫大窑记
    田流
    天大的困难，只要决心克服它，“困难”也就不是困难了。
    大连玻璃工厂熔化部长刘茂有——这位二十六年工龄，解放后升任该厂熔化部长的老工人，就是这样的人物。因为他面对困难，勇敢的克服困难，解决了玻璃生产中重大技术问题，使该厂一九四九年六个月的生产量等于日寇侵占时期最高年产量（一九四三年）百分之一百六十三，创造了半年完成全年计划的伟迹。因为他坚定的站在解决困难的最前面，使该厂于今年八月二十八日，超过完成了一九五○年生产计划，为国家创造了巨大的财富。
  （一）
    要想知道刘茂有怎样创造出这样大的生产成绩，先得清楚刘茂有是个怎样的人。
    刘茂有出生于雇农家庭，十三岁就给地主扛活、打柴、下海捕鱼。海上风浪大，鱼船小，海风常常一下子把小船抛上波浪的尖顶，又骤然间把它甩下海浪的漩涡。十几岁的孩子，日夜生活在死亡的边缘。跑海一直跑到二十四岁，肚子跑不饱。无奈何到玻璃工厂（那时是日寇的“昌光硝子株式会社”）作大窑装料小工，大窑就像一盆火，烤的他头昏目眩，特别是到修窑时，不等“玻璃油子”凉下来日寇就逼着修，把他的手、脸烫的一块青一块紫，修一次窑就像生一场病，浑身脱层皮。
    生活的熬煎，使他的身体一天天瘦下来，进厂二十年，只剩下一付骨头架子。但灾难的生活，并不能消磨他的志气，三十年的磨难养成了他永不屈服于任何困难的钢铁性格。
    一九四五年苏军解放了旅大，刘茂有和所有的人一样，从帝国主义奴役下翻了身。从此，老刘才开始过上了“人的生活”，才知道什么叫做人。因为他解放后积极工作，努力生产，一九四七年初升任为该厂熔化部长。被旧社会踩在脚底下的刘茂有，作梦也没有想到有这么一天，他深深的体会到：只有苏联才能帮助一切被帝国主义侵略的国家获得解放；只有共产党才能把受压迫的人扶起来。他的阶级觉悟一天天高起来。一九四八年更光荣的参加了共产党。从此，老刘更积极，处处带头，不辞劳苦的工作着。
  （二）
    大窑是玻璃工厂的心脏，一秒钟也不能停止跳动。刘茂有经过苦思深钻，终于延长了大窑的寿命，第一次保卫大窑成功。
    一九四九年二月间，大连玻璃工厂全体职工，为一件重大的事情焦急起来了。熔化大窑按照使用的期限，应于二月十五日大修。查看大窑的情况，也实在该修了。一天二十四小时被发着白光的玻璃浆液冲击侵蚀着的大窑，与玻璃熔液水平面接触的地方，已侵蚀了一道很深的沟，三百糎厚的铁砖（苛洛哈砖），有的地方只剩下五十糎厚，再使用下去，一千四、五百度的玻璃熔液，势将破壁而出——那时一切都不堪设想了。
    全厂每一个人都在着急，二十六年的老工友，解放后升任熔化部长的刘茂有更是坐卧不安，他比谁都清楚，熔化大窑是玻璃工厂的心脏，一秒钟也不能停止跳动，大窑停工，全厂就不能生产。马上修吧——耐火砖一时准备不齐，苛洛哈砖根本没有。停工等待修窑器材吧——将完不成生产计划。工厂已成为国家和工人自己的企业，谁又甘心呢？惟一的出路是延长大窑寿命。厂长在七、八天内，连着把老刘找来了五、六次，“老刘，你看怎么样？”厂长见老刘就问：“能不能想办法把大窑的寿命再延长下去？”党总支书记也天天动员大家：“发挥工人阶级的创造性，大家想办法，共产党员没有克服不了的困难。”苏联工程师和中国副厂长领导下的合理化建议委员会，则动员全体职工特别是经验丰富的老技术工人，集中钻研这个急待解决的困难。党的教育在老刘心里所培植起来的对人民企业的责任感，使他三十年来同困难搏斗中养成的钢铁意志更坚强，在党的鼓励和行政支持下，老刘下决心要克服这个困难。
    “困难？”老刘说：“困难也要想办法，也要解决！”
    那些日子，他简直像中了魔，成天价围着大窑团团转，走过来转过去都是在想怎样延长大窑寿命的事。这一天，他完工回来，一想又想到半夜多。正在苦思不得之际，忽然想起过去下海捕鱼的事来：一次他沿着退潮后的海岸航行，见岸上平时同海水相接处，有一道深深的沟，海水侵不着的地方，自然完整无损，就是被海水整日淹没着的地方，也很少侵蚀——这一下可使老刘想开啦，大窑的情况不也正是这样么？每年修窑时都是和玻璃熔液水面相接的地方有一道很深的沟，“大概毛病就出在这‘水平面’上”，老刘想：“如果把玻璃熔液水平降低一些把被侵蚀的地方露出来，一定能延长大窑寿命。”第二天一清早他就跑进工厂，同厂长一说，立刻得到厂长的热烈鼓励。工程技术人员又给以科学的分析和启发，说他这个合理建议“完全合乎科学”。老刘一听，信心大增，经行政批准后，便开始实行起来。他先把玻璃熔液适当的降低，使它不再侵蚀那已被侵蚀得很薄的地方，消除了窑壁薄弱地方的负担，但玻璃熔液终不是海水啊，虽然降低玻璃熔液的水平之后，消除了窑壁薄弱地方的直接遭受冲击，但一千四、五百度的高热却仍然继续着对大窑的侵蚀，于是他又想出减轻炉体高热侵蚀的合理化建议，把日寇装置火炉风管的老“规格”打破，增添了两个大风管，加大了风力，使被侵蚀着的铁砖急速冷却，减轻高热的侵蚀。就是这样，大窑被保存下来了。工友们欢呼着增加生产。四月，中共旅大党公开时，工人阶级和自己的政党见了面，兴奋非常，掀起了火热的“拥党生产竞赛”。该厂全体工友要在“七一”前完成全年任务，作为对自己的党和亲爱领袖毛主席的献礼。每一个人都在努力：工人们在接班前三分钟就来到自己岗位的旁边，熟习上一班的工作情形和机器的状况，以便时间一到，马上接班继续生产，全厂工人无故欠勤的现象减少到千分之一；制板部解决了玻璃熔液降低后与制板和距离增大所引起的一连串的技术问题。恰恰在“七一”早晨八点钟，当火红的太阳从东方升起的时候，玻璃工厂完成了全年的生产计划，使该厂获得“旅大一等模范工厂”的光荣称号，老刘也被评为“旅大工业劳动英雄”。他的保护大窑延长大窑寿命的方法，在我国玻璃工业建设中发射出特殊的光辉，这一改进的技术价值，和由它产生的经济价值是无法计量的。
    全厂千余工友在生产胜利声中庆祝党的生日，简直是群情沸腾，欢欣若狂。全体工友签名上书毛主席，报告获得解放了的工人阶级，在党领导下创造出来的建厂二十五年来所未有的生产伟绩。大窑呢——依然无恙，火红的玻璃熔液顺畅的流入拔玻璃的埚内，迅速的拔出净光雪亮的玻璃板。于是刘茂有又提出新的保证，要使大窑延用到苏联红军解放旅大的“九三”胜利节。这是一个多么使人感奋的口号啊，就在那一天，旅大工人阶级永远摆脱了奴隶的锁枷。成了自己命运的主人。全体工友又投入了新的生产热潮，直到九月十五日才正式停火。
    刘茂有虽然解放后就升任了熔化部长，但他却一天也没有停止过劳动，他总是在最困难，生产中最带关键性的岗位上工作。九月十五日大窑停火后，紧接着又是一场紧张热烈的搏斗，刘茂有亲自领导着六百个突击队员组成的修窑大队，每天艰苦的工作着。停火的第三天，窑里依然火热，衣服一挨上就会燃烧，但工友们都不愿再等下去了。老刘虽已是四十八岁的人，干起活来却像二十多岁的小伙子，把衣服一脱就首先跳入窑内修起来。工友们也就一个个跟着跳进去。窑内的热度高，老刘和工友们的情绪更高，十四天便完成了二十二天的修窑计划，三十三天又开始生产玻璃，比原计划提前十五天。而在日寇统治时代，修一次大窑最快也要七十六天呢！
  （三）
    刘茂有发动车间全体工人，向困难进攻，再次保全大窑。
    这次修大窑全是用的旧砖，旧砖规格不统一、质量差，容易出毛病是可以想像得出的，但出什么毛病，在那儿出毛病又是想像不到的。为着胜利完成比一九四九年要高百分之四十五以上的今年（一九五○）的生产计划，老刘对大窑的卫护更加仔细小心了。自从一九四九年九月二十九日修好大窑生起火的那天起，他每天早晨来到工厂时，必定先到窑前窑后左察右看，最后停在窑门口，蹲在那里仔细的看着它。去年修窑时为着要使送料机进出方便，根据苏联的经验，把窑门由原来的一米八改成五米宽，这样可以使工友装窑下料时节省劳动力，并且原料撒开撒得匀，熔化的透彻。谁知料子旧、质不好，点火后随着温度升高，窑门悬插砖便被压开一道裂缝，同时分秒不停的被一千四、五百度瓦斯高热冲击着，到年底悬插砖便被侵蚀了三分之二。烧不了很久——顶多到今年（一九五○年）五月就会被完全蚀透，那时露出里面的铸钢（即皮钢），不到八小时铸钢就会熔化，而使大窑前脸整个的坍下来，真要那样，不停火修窑就没有第二个办法。停止生产的危险一天天逼近前来，刘茂有的心也一天天沉重起来。他整日的蹲在窑门口，目不转睛的看着它沉思、出神、琢磨着解决办法，“难道就没有解决的办法了么？”老刘常常自言自语：“难道党给的保证全年不修窑，完成并超过比一九四九年高及一半的任务就不能实现了吗？”
    刘茂有，这位在困难中搏斗过来的胜利者，这位有二十六年丰富的玻璃生产经验的老工友，这位解放后升任熔化部长，几年来在党的教育和苏联先进经验帮助下，成熟起来的人民企业管理者，不仅没有被困难吓倒，而是更加坚毅的向困难突进，不仅自己一人专心致志的钻研着征服困难的办法，他更运用苏联的经验，召开车间会议，动员起全车间的工人，来解决这个困难。在老刘领导下日益觉悟起来的工人们想出了许多办法！有人说用砖垒起来，将铸钢板顶住，使它不致坍下来；有人说在铸钢外面加上水包，使它减低温度不致熔化……这怎么行呢？窑内是激荡着的玻璃熔液，砖垒起来没有“根”，那还会稳固？按水包就更不行了，什么样的水包能抗一千四、五百度的高温？
    老刘不灰心，大家也不灰心，谁都费尽心血的想着各种各样的解决办法。最后老刘想出了一个用砖将悬叉子浸蚀了地方挡起来的办法。这样就不会使悬叉子被烧坏而露出铸钢来，挡的砖坏了还可以换新的。车间会议上一讨论，大家都说这办法好，于是就试验起来，最初用红耐火砖试验，但这种砖不经烧，又改用硅石砖试验，证明能抗三个月，就决定用硅石砖嵌入，并加设扁形风管，使它减少侵蚀。一切试验好后，往里嵌硅石砖时可费了老劲啦，炉内那样的高温，是不能用手拿着去嵌的，工友们使用铁丝把砖缠住，先从小窑门把砖递进去，一个人扯着铁丝，别人拨拉着往里嵌。工友们虽然人人被火烤的满头大汗，但这个困难终于被他们征服了，使大窑前脸寿命有了保障，保住了大窑门。
    事情常常是一通百顺的，由于老刘创造了保护大窑的新纪录，全厂便接二连三的在八个月内创造了八十三件各方面的新纪录，有百分之九十一的职工投入到新纪录运动中来。这些新纪录汇合在一起，百分之九十一的职工扭成了一股劲，就变成了全厂的新纪录——八月二十八日超过完成了一九五○年的全年生产计划，成本降低了百分之七·八，一等品提高到百分之六十八（计划为百分之三十），生产率较日寇最高时期（一九四三年）提高百分之一百四十八。
    天大的困难，只要决心克服它，困难也就不是困难了。大连玻璃工厂熔化部长刘茂有就是这样的人物。因为他勇敢的同困难搏斗。使该厂一九四九年半年完成了全年任务；因为他永远站在解决困难的最前面，又使该厂在八月二十八日超过完成了一九五○年的全年计划。为国家创造了巨大的财富，解决了祖国玻璃工业建设中的重大技术问题。
