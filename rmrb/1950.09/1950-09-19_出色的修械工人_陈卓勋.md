　　The Outstanding Repairman - Chen Zhuoxun
　　·Méi Cūn·
　　Comrade Chen Zhuoxun joined the revolution in 1939 and is a Communist Party member. He currently serves as the leader of the fitter squad at the repair shop of the Machinery General Factory of a certain unit in North China. He is an outstanding repairman.

　　In June 1947, our army was preparing for a campaign. The repair shop received the task of repairing over a hundred incomplete machine guns and more than three hundred broken rifles. At the time, the repair shop had a total of nine workers, most of whom were not yet proficient in repairing weapons. It seemed impossible to complete such a huge task in seven days. Therefore, many people lacked confidence.

　　However, this was a military mission and had to be completed on time no matter what. Comrade Chen Zhuoxun, as the team leader, not only patiently mobilized everyone to overcome all difficulties and resolutely complete the task on time, but also took the lead in starting the work himself.

　　Under his leadership, the crash project began, working non-stop from day to night, from night to dawn. But after three or four days, everyone couldn't even eat, and they would doze off while working. Comrade Chen Zhuoxun allocated two hours of rest in shifts for everyone. But he himself couldn't bother to rest; he had to inspect, supervise, and guide everyone, while also trying to speed up his own work as much as possible. However, his body was particularly weak, and he would also doze off after working for a long time. So, he decided to fight against sleepiness; as soon as he closed his eyes, he would suddenly jump up and drive away the sleepiness. But after doing this several times, he couldn't drive away the sleepiness anymore. So, he changed his method again; he prepared a basin of cold water, and as soon as sleepiness came, he would immerse his head in the cold water; but gradually the cold water also lost its effect, and as soon as his head was lifted from the cold water, he would faint again. However, he tried all kinds of methods and finally overcame fatigue. For seven days and seven nights, Comrade Chen Zhuoxun worked tenaciously—no, fought—and successfully completed the task.

　　In 1948, the troops marched on a long journey. More than a hundred carts were pulling ammunition, following the army's advance. One day, while traveling in the deep mountains, the axles of many carts suddenly broke. It was a newly liberated area, and vehicles could not be mobilized. What to do? The repair shop had to repair them overnight.

　　Comrade Chen Zhuoxun had walked all day carrying a lot of things, and he was extremely tired when he arrived at the campsite. However, as soon as he heard that the carts needed to be repaired, his energy immediately came back. He threw his backpack on the ground and led the whole team, borrowing bellows and coal, starting a fire, and working diligently.

　　The axles were forged, but the screw threads on the axles had to be made with a lathe. Where to find a lathe in these deep mountains? Comrade Chen Zhuoxun frowned as he looked at the axles. He thought: If the carts are not repaired, it will delay transportation and affect the battle, and this cannot be allowed.

　　With no other choice, Comrade Chen Zhuoxun followed the screw threads on the other end of the axle and slowly filed them with an iron file, filing all night long under the dim oil lamp. Finally, he filed a small groove—each groove was exactly the right width and depth, just like one made by a lathe. The next morning, all the carts set off smoothly.

　　In a certain offensive operation, Comrade Chen Zhuoxun saw that after the troops scaled the city walls, the transportation of the wounded and ammunition often suffered unnecessary losses due to the obstacles of the city walls and trenches. Therefore, he used bicycle gears and chains, and made several wooden wheels, found a few ropes, and painstakingly studied and experimented every day after arriving at the campsite. Finally, he created a "high-line ammunition transport device," which worked very well when used.

　　Comrade Chen Zhuoxun came from a blacksmith background and originally did not understand the repair of weapons. Since joining the repair shop, he has worked hard to study the technology. Once, the troops captured a Japanese "Type 96 Light Machine Gun," with many parts damaged. Comrade Chen Zhuoxun wanted to repair it, but he had never seen this type of machine gun before. He inquired and found out that a certain regiment had one, so he ran over to study it, asking the soldiers to disassemble each part and carefully examine it. Finally, he quickly learned and repaired the damaged "Type 96 Light Machine Gun." Before this year's "May Day," he saw an American-made 37mm anti-tank gun in the yard, with only the barrel and carriage. He decided to repair this gun as a gift to celebrate "May Day." He carefully studied the design and performance of each part, leading the whole team to find available scrap materials for modification and repair. Finally, before "May Day," a new American-made 37mm anti-tank gun appeared.

　　In this way, Comrade Chen Zhuoxun, with his high level of work enthusiasm and creativity, overcame all difficulties under extremely difficult technical and material conditions, repairing weapons and other equipment for the troops, which played a great role in the victory of the war. This year, during "May Day," he was elected as a first-class labor hero of the entire factory. Now he has been selected as a representative of the troops to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

　　出色的修械工人——陈卓勋
    ·梅村·
    陈卓勋同志，一九三九年参加革命，共产党员。现在担任华北某部机械总厂修械所钳工班长。是一个出色的修械工人。
    一九四七年六月间，我军某部准备一个战役。修械所接受了修理百余挺残缺不全的机枪和三百多支坏步枪的任务。当时修械所共九个工人，在修理武器方面大半还不熟练。要在七天内完成这样巨大的任务，看起来似乎是不可能的。因此，很多人都没有信心。
    但是，这是军事任务，无论如何得按时完成的。陈卓勋同志是组长，他除耐心地动员大家克服一切困难，坚决按时完成外，自己便带头动手干起来。
    在他的带领下，突击工作开始了，从白天到夜里，从夜里到天明，一刻也不停。但经过三四天以后，大家连饭也吃不下了，做着做着活就迷迷糊糊睡着了。陈卓勋同志分配大家轮流休息两个钟头。而他自己却顾不得休息；他一面要检查、督促和指导每个人，一面得尽量加快自己的工作速度。不过，他的身体特别瘦弱，工作久了也就打起盹来了。于是，他就决心和瞌睡搏斗；刚一合眼，就猛然跳起，把瞌睡赶走。可是这样几次之后，瞌睡赶也赶不走了。他就又改变办法；准备一盆冷水，瞌睡一来，就把头浸在冷水里；但慢慢地冷水也失去了作用，头刚从冷水里抬起来，又昏迷啦。但是，他想尽各种办法，终于战胜疲劳，一连七天七夜，陈卓勋同志顽强地工作着——不，战斗着，——胜利地完成了任务。
    一九四八年，部队远行军。百余辆大车拉着弹药随军挺进。一天，走到深山里，不少大车的车轴突然断了。那是新解放区，不能动员车辆，怎么办呢？修械所要连夜给修理好。
    陈卓勋同志背着好多东西走了一天路，到宿营地已经疲倦到极点。可是，一听到要修大车，劲头马上就来啦。他将背包往地上一甩，就带领全组，借风箱，借煤，生火，叮叮当当的干起来。
    车轴打成了，可是轴上的螺丝扣必须有旋床才能做成。在这深山里那里找旋床呢？陈卓勋同志看着车轴直发愁。他心想：大车修不好，就要耽误运输，影响作战，这是不能允许的。
    在没有办法的情况下，陈卓勋同志就照着车轴那头的螺丝扣，用铁锉慢慢地锉起来，在暗淡的油灯下，一直锉到天亮。终于锉成了一道子小沟——每道沟的宽窄深浅完全合适，和旋床旋的一样。第二天一大早，全部大车就顺利的出发了。
    在某次攻坚作战中，陈卓勋同志看到部队登城以后，运送伤员和弹药常因城墙、壕沟的阻碍，受到不应有的损失。于是，他就利用自行车的齿轮和铁链，并造成了几个木轮，找了几条绳子，每天到宿营地后就苦心研究，反复试验，终于创造了一种“高线弹药运送器”，使用起来，效果很好。
    陈卓勋同志，是铁匠出身，对修理武器本来是不懂得的。自从参加修械所工作以后，他就努力钻研技术。有一次，部队缴获了一挺日式“卡机凯”轻机枪，枪上不少零件都被破坏。陈卓勋同志想把它修理好，但是他从来未见过这种机枪。他打听出某团有一挺，就跑去研究，请战士们拆开每个零件，细心揣摸。终于很快学会，把残破的“卡机凯”修好了。今年“五一”前，他看见院里放着一门美式三七战防炮，只有炮筒和炮架。他决心要修好这门炮，作为向“五一”节献礼。他仔细研究了每个零件的图样性能，领导全班寻找可以利用的废料，加以改造、修配。终于在“五一”以前，出现了一门新的美式三七战防炮。
    就这样，陈卓勋同志以自己的高度的工作热情和创造性，在极端困难的技术条件和物质条件下，克服一切困难，给部队修理武器和其他器械，这对战争的胜利，起了很大作用。今年“五一”时，他当选为全厂甲等劳动英雄。现在又被选为部队出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议代表。
