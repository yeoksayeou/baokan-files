　　Winter is Approaching, Disaster Victims Urgently Need Winter Clothing!
    Disaster Relief Clothing Donation General Association Sends Telegrams to Various Regions to Rapidly Establish Branch Associations to Complete Donation Tasks
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] The Anhui North, Jiangsu North, Hebei, and Henan Disaster Relief Clothing Donation General Association telegraphed on the 19th to the Northeast, Central South, Southwest, Northwest, and East China Major Administrative Regions Military and Political Committees, as well as the North China provinces and the Beijing and Tianjin Municipal People's Governments, urging them to swiftly organize winter clothing donation branch associations in order to complete the donation work as soon as possible. The text of the telegram is as follows:
    Since July of this year, parts of Anhui North, Jiangsu North, Hebei, and Henan have suffered from continuous rain. The Huai River water system has been in disrepair for many years, and the bandit Chiang Kai-shek's breaching of the Yellow River into the Huai River has further silted and flooded the Huai River, making the disaster situation in Anhui North particularly severe. Now, winter is approaching in the blink of an eye, and disaster victims urgently need winter clothing. In order to assist disaster victims without clothing, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Democratic Youth Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, the China People's Relief Association, and the Red Cross Society of China jointly initiated the establishment of the Anhui North, Jiangsu North, Hebei, and Henan Disaster Relief Clothing Donation General Association in Beijing on the 18th of this month to begin donation work. However, there are many disaster victims, and the need for winter clothing is both great and urgent. The Association's strength is weak, and we fear that we will not be able to complete the task on schedule. We hope that the major administrative regions and the North China provinces, the Beijing and Tianjin Municipal relief agencies, mass organizations, democratic parties, and enthusiastic relief workers from all walks of life will respond in unison and swiftly establish winter clothing donation branch associations, with the aim of completing the donation task within two months. In areas near the disaster areas, the focus should be on in-kind donations (regardless of gender, age, new or old, single-layer, lined, cotton, woolen, leather clothing, quilts, and other winter items are all acceptable), supplemented by cash donations (currency and gold and silver ornaments, etc.). In distant areas, the focus should be on cash donations. Time is pressing, and we hope that everyone will pool their efforts and raise funds in many ways so that millions of disaster victims can keep warm. We await your efforts with great anticipation.

　　冬令即届，灾民迫切需要寒衣！
    灾民寒衣劝募总会分电各地  迅速建立分会完成劝募任务
    【新华社二十二日讯】皖北苏北河北河南灾民寒衣劝募总会于十九日分电东北、中南、西南、西北、华东各大行政区军政委员会及华北各省、北京、天津两市人民政府，迅速组织寒衣劝募分会，以便早日完成劝募工作。该电电文如下：
    今年七月以来，皖北、苏北、河北、河南的部分地区，霪雨为灾。淮河水系多年失修，蒋匪决黄入淮，益使淮流淤塞泛滥，故皖北灾情尤为惨重。现转瞬冬令即届，灾民迫切需要寒衣。为援助无衣灾民，中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国民主青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中国人民救济总会、中国红十字会等发起于本月十八日在京成立皖北、苏北、河北、河南灾民寒衣劝募总会，开始劝募工作。惟灾民甚众，需要寒衣既多且迫，本会力薄，恐不能如期集事，希各大行政区及华北各省、北京、天津两市救济机关、群众团体、民主党派及各界热心救济人士同声相应，迅速建立寒衣劝募分会，期于两月内完成劝募任务。灾区附近，实物为主（不论男女老少，不分新旧，单夹棉毛皮等衣服及棉被等其他御寒物品均可。），代金（货币及金银饰物等）兼收。远地则以代金为主。时机迫切，尚望群策群力，多方募集，使数百万灾民得以御寒，毋任企祷。

              副主任委员  张治中、许广平、杨立三
