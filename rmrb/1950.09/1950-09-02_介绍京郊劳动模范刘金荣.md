Introducing Liu Jinrong, Model Worker of the Beijing Suburbs
    Wu Hong
    Liu Jinrong is from Liulangzhuang in the 13th district of Beijing. He is forty years old this year. He has been "carrying long loads" for people since he was seventeen. His grandfather and father "carried long loads" for two generations, and even with his own twenty-two years of hard work, they didn't acquire an acre of land, not even a "ditch head," let alone a house. After liberation, Liu Jinrong joined the farmers' association and has been very active in his work. He also joined the Communist Party. Last year, during the land reform, his family of six was allocated only nine mu and four fen of paddy fields and three gray houses. Now he is the propaganda committee member of the Liulangzhuang Party branch and the production committee member of the village government. He works selflessly, sacrificing his own interests for the interests of the masses, and has created exemplary deeds in regulating water use, preventing waterlogging, and eliminating pests.
    Liulangzhuang has many paddy fields, and water use is difficult. In the past, farmers often had disputes over water use. Last year, in May, due to drought, the Water Conservancy Management Committee put Liu Jinrong in charge of regulating water use. He devised a method to first irrigate the paddy fields far from the water source and then irrigate the paddy fields near the water source. He personally inspected every night, rain or shine. He often advised everyone: "One family using water cannot eat their fill, only when everyone has a good harvest can everyone eat their fill." When it was dry, he did not use water in his own fields, letting others use it first, so everyone stopped fighting for water, and all 3,684 mu of paddy fields were irrigated. One night, he discovered that someone near Bagou Village had dug a hole to steal water, affecting the irrigation of downstream paddy fields. He bravely jumped into the water to block it. Because it was dark and he couldn't see clearly, he injured his hand and couldn't work for more than twenty days. In early spring this year, Liu Jinrong and other village cadres mobilized seven or eight hundred people to dig ditches. The weather was cold and the water was freezing, but Liu Jinrong jumped into the water first, leading everyone to go down and dig a ditch more than four li long. When dismantling the dam to release water, it was late and the masses went home from work, but he jumped into the chest-deep water alone and insisted on dismantling it completely. The stone bridge near Ge Da was too low, affecting the water flow. Liu Jinrong led the masses to use iron chains to move the stone bars and raise the stone bridge by more than a foot. There were several large stone strips at the bottom of the river in Qinghua Yuan, hindering the water flow. Liu Jinrong jumped into the water again, leading everyone to move the stone strips away. Later, grass grew in the ditch, and he led the masses to cut the grass clean, so that the water flowed smoothly without obstruction. On July 3rd, it rained heavily. Liu Jinrong, concerned about everyone's fields, braved the rain to check the water flow and found a wooden board with stakes nailed to it blocking the water flow under the bridge at Li Jia Pao Zi. The water was already chest-deep, and if it wasn't pulled away, the fields would be flooded soon. Liu Jinrong jumped into the water without hesitation to pull the board. Because he used too much force, he fell on the board and broke his left arm. Now his left arm is still in a sling. Everyone was moved by his spirit of work, and more than one hundred farmers automatically helped him weed the rice. Seeing that everyone was taking care of him like this, Liu Jinrong felt that he should work even more actively, and he got up to insist on working only a week after the injury. On August 16th, it rained heavily. The riverbank near the Er Kong Bridge in the west of the village had a breach, and water was flowing into the fields. He was focused on saving the land, forgetting the pain in his left arm, and used his right hand to hug grass and block the breach. Under Liu Jinrong's responsible and planned leadership, Liulangzhuang's paddy fields not only solved the difficulty of water use during drought, but also avoided flooding this year when the rainfall was more than double that of last year, preserving the harvest. If there are no more unexpected disasters before the harvest, it is estimated that each mu of paddy field can yield two shi six or seven dou, which is at least 10% more than the normal yield of two shi three or four dou per mu.
    The paddy fields are harmed by "grasshoppers" every year. The rice leaves are eaten, affecting the growth of the rice. The masses have no habit of catching them. But to increase production by 10%, in addition to solving the "water" problem, it is also necessary to eliminate pests. Liu Jinrong figured out a way to eliminate pests: in the spring, turn the "grasshopper eggs" out of the ground, and when the paddy fields are flooded, the "grasshopper eggs" float on the surface of the water. After being blown by the wind, they gather in a corner, and then they are scooped up. This year, under Liu Jinrong's advocacy and leadership, Liulangzhuang launched a village-wide "scooping grasshopper eggs" campaign, collecting more than 800 jin. As a result, more than 3,600 mu of paddy fields were not harmed by pests.
    More than twenty years of "long labor" have given Liu Jinrong rich experience in paddy field production, and his enthusiasm for production, which had long been restricted by the evil feudal land system, has been fully unleashed after the earth-shattering land reform movement. In the past, when transplanting rice seedlings for landlords, Liu Jinrong could only transplant eight fen of land a day, at most one mu. Now, when working for himself, he can transplant one mu and four fen of land a day. Although he is busy with work, because he works diligently, the third-grade rice seedlings he newly divided are no worse than the first-grade ones. They are about three chi tall and have already sprouted rice ears. This year's harvest can be as good as the first-grade ones, yielding two shi six or seven dou per mu. At the same time, he also takes the time to help others plant land, nurture seedlings for inexperienced farmers who have newly divided land, spread rice stalks, and explain rice planting methods. When the hired peasant Li Lian became ill, he helped with all the work and mobilized six people to help him catch insects and transplant seedlings. When Li had nothing to eat, he lent him one hundred jin of corn and 40,000 yuan. Under his influence, the Party members, Youth League members, and masses of Liulangzhuang always help each other, solve production and life difficulties, and are as closely united as a family.
    For the benefit of everyone, Liu Jinrong never cares about his personal gains or losses. Managing water conservancy for a year earns him a subsidy of 750 jin of corn, but he misses out on earning 2,500 jin of corn by carrying long loads. His father complained to him, and he said, "You and grandpa carried long loads for two generations and didn't earn any land; the Communist Party came and then we had land, and you still talk about making money!" Last year, when drilling an electric well, Liu Jinrong led the masses to dig and transport yellow clay at Anhe Bridge, persisting for more than forty days without taking a single yuan of wages. He missed ten days of work digging the West Ditch and Shuangqiao Ditch, and he didn't take a single jin of relief rice.
    Liu Jinrong has been elected as a representative of the Beijing suburban model workers and is about to attend the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers. The farmers of Liulangzhuang all believe that this is the most glorious thing for the village. They all say, "In the past, scholars became number one scholars, but now it is the working people who become heroes!" Some say, "Liu Jinrong is really worthy of being a hero and model, no one can compare to him. If we elect model workers again, I will still choose him." (Beijing Municipal News Agency)

　　介绍京郊劳动模范刘金荣
    吴宏
    刘金荣是北京市第十三区六郎庄人，今年四十岁。从十七岁起便给人“扛长活”。他爷爷和父亲扛了两辈子“长活”，加上自己二十二年的苦工，也没置上一亩地，连“沟嘴”都没有，房子更不用提了。解放后，刘金荣就参加了农会，工作一直很积极。并参加了共产党。去年土地改革时，一家六口才分得九亩四分稻地，三间灰房，现在他是六郎庄党支部宣传委员和村政府的生产委员。他忘我地工作着，为了群众的利益牺牲自己的利益，创造了调节用水，防止水涝，灭除虫害的模范事迹。
    六郎庄稻田多，用水困难，往年农民常因抢着用水发生纠纷。去年五月天旱，水利管理委员会让刘金荣负责调节用水。他设法先灌离水源远处的稻田而后灌离水源近处的稻田，每晚并亲去检查，风雨无阻。他常劝告大家：“一家使水不能吃饱饭，大家收成好了才能都吃饱饭。”天旱了，他自己地里不用水，让人先用，于是大家都不抢水了，三千六百八十四亩稻地都得到灌溉。一天晚上，他发现巴沟村附近有人扒开洞子偷水，影响下流稻田灌溉，便奋不顾身下水去堵，因天黑，看不清，碰伤了手，二十多天不能干活。今年初春，刘金荣和其他村干部发动七八百群众挖沟渠。天寒水冷，刘金荣先跳下水，带动大家都下去把一条四里多长的沟渠挖好。拆坝放水时，天色已晚，群众收工回家，他又一人跳到胸脯深的水里坚持拆完。革大附近石桥太低，影响流水量，刘金荣带领群众用铁链挪动石条将石桥修高一尺多。清华园内河底有数块大条石，妨碍流水，刘金荣又先跳下水带动大家把石条挪开。以后沟里长了草，又带动群众将草割净，使水流畅无阻。七月三日大雨，刘金荣记挂着大家的田地，冒雨检查水流，发现李家泡子桥下一块钉有桩橛的木板堵住水流，水已深及胸脯，要不拉开，眼看便要淹地了。刘金荣便不顾一切跳下水去拉板。因用力过猛，跌在板上，将左臂骨折断，现在他的左臂还吊挂着。大家为他的工作精神所感动，一百多农民自动帮他薅稻子。刘金荣见大家这样照顾自己，觉得更应积极工作，跌伤才一星期便起来坚持工作。八月十六日大雨，村西二孔桥边河岸开了一口子，水往地里流，他一心想着救地，忘记了左臂的伤痛，又用一只右手抱着草下水堵住了口子。在刘金荣对工作负责有计划的领导下，六郎庄稻地不仅在天旱时解决了用水的困难，并且在今年雨水大于去年一倍以上的情况下未遭水淹，保住了收成，如果收获前不再有意外灾害，估计每亩稻地可收二石六、七斗，比常年产量每亩二石三、四斗，至少可以增加一成。
    稻田年年受“蚂蚱”之害，稻叶被吃，影响稻子的成长。群众向无捕捉习惯。但要想把生产提高一成，除了解决“水”的问题，还要除灭虫害。刘金荣琢磨出除虫的办法：春天把“蚂蚱子”（卵）从地里翻上来，稻田放水，“蚂蚱子”便漂浮水面，经风一吹，聚集一角，然后捞掉。六郎庄今年在刘金荣提倡和领导下，开展了全村“捞蚂蚱子”运动，共捞八百余斤。使三千六百多亩的稻地未受虫害。
    二十余年的“长活”，使刘金荣有了丰富的稻田生产经验，而他那长期被罪恶的封建土地制度所束缚的生产积极性，经过翻天复地的土地改革运动，就充分发挥出来了。过去，替地主插秧的时候，刘金荣一天只插八分地，顶多也只是一亩，现在替自己干活，一天能插秧一亩四分地。虽然工作忙，因为干活勤快，他新分的三等地稻子长得不比上等地差，高约三尺，已莠出稻穗。今年的收成，也能跟上等地一样，每亩可收到二石六、七斗。同时他还抽空帮人种地，给新分地无经验的农民养苗，抹稻梗，讲解稻子种植法。雇农李连生病了，什么活他都帮着干，还动员六人帮他捉地插苗。李没吃的，他借给一百斤玉米，四万元钱。在他影响下，六郎庄的党、团员和群众总是互相帮助，解决生产及生活上的困难，亲密团结得像一家人一样。
    为了大伙的利益，刘金荣从不计较他个人的得失。管水利一年得到七百五十斤玉米的津贴，但耽误了扛活，少赚二千五百斤玉米。父亲抱怨他，他说：“您和爷爷扛了两辈子长活也没赚下地；共产党来了，才有了地，还说赚钱哩！”去年打电井，刘金荣带领群众去安河桥挖运黄胶泥，坚持四十多天，不取一元工资。挖西沟和双桥沟耽误十天活，也未拿一斤赈米。
    刘金荣当选京郊劳动模范代表，就要出席全国工农兵劳动模范会议了。六郎庄农民都认为这是村里最光荣的一件事。都说：“以前读书人当状元，现在是劳动人民当英雄啦！”有的说：“刘金荣真够当个英雄模范的，谁也比不过他。要再选举劳动模范，我还是选他。”        （京市新闻处）
