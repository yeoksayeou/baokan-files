　　At the UN General Assembly
    The Soviet Union Proposes a Plan for Lasting Peace
    I. Condemn Certain Countries for Engaging in Propaganda for a New War and Demand Punishment for Such Crimes
    II. Unconditional Prohibition of Atomic Weapons and Declaration of First User as a War Criminal
    III. Five Great Powers Conclude a Treaty of Peace and Each Reduce Armaments by One-Third This Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, New York, 21st] TASS, New York, 21st: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary meeting on the afternoon of the 20th to begin a general debate.
    The debate began with a speech by the Brazilian representative, Mr. Freitas Valle, who made empty appeals to the member states of the United Nations to make efforts to eliminate their differences and reconcile their divergences. Mr. Freitas Valle was obviously preparing the ground for an attempt to undermine the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the Security Council; he said that the so-called "veto" had been "abused". But Mr. Freitas Valle said he did not agree with those who suggested expanding the powers of the General Assembly in order to undermine the Security Council. He acknowledged that "the Security Council is the body primarily responsible for maintaining peace, and it is impossible to avoid danger if its power is weakened."
    After Mr. Freitas Valle's speech, the US representative, Mr. Acheson, spoke. He put forward the US proposal, advocating sacrificing the Security Council to enhance the power of the General Assembly, in order to undermine the principle of unanimity among the great powers in the UN Security Council. It is clear from Mr. Acheson's speech that the aim of the US proposal is to use the United Nations as a cloak to cover up future US aggression, in order to replay the precedent of what the US did in the Korean affair on a larger scale.
    Mr. Acheson began by declaring his loyalty to the United Nations Organization, and then used many words to denounce the policies pursued by the Soviet Union as creating difficulties for the collective security system; Mr. Acheson essentially repeated all the unfounded accusations against the Soviet Union put forward by the US-British imperialist propaganda machine at the last session of the General Assembly.
    As a "positive" part of Mr. Acheson's speech, he put forward a four-point plan, which in fact aims to reduce the role and importance of the Security Council and weaken the activities stipulated in the UN Charter.
    The first recommendation in his approach stipulates that if the Security Council is obstructed and unable to take action in the event of "a breach of the peace or an act of aggression", an emergency meeting of the General Assembly must be convened within twenty-four hours after the notification is issued.
    The second recommendation is to establish "security patrol teams" to observe and report on so-called "any area where there is a threat of international conflict."
    The third recommendation in Mr. Acheson's plan is to force each member state to designate some troops in their respective armed forces to serve "on behalf of the United Nations." And everyone knows that in this UN General Assembly, the mechanical voting system follows the orders of the United States.
    The fourth recommendation is to require the General Assembly to establish a committee to "study and report on the methods" that the United Nations "may use" to take so-called collective action (including the use of force).
    At the conclusion of his speech, Mr. Acheson suggested that the issue of Formosa (the US term for Taiwan - Editor's Note) be placed on the agenda of the General Assembly.
    The next speaker was the head of the Soviet delegation, Mr. Vyshinsky, who presented to the General Assembly a genuine plan for establishing lasting peace throughout the world. Mr. Vyshinsky said: "The work of the General Assembly begins with a general debate, in which it is customary to summarize the activities of the United Nations over the past year and to define new tasks and ways of completing them. Such an exchange of views can promote mutual understanding among the delegations and is also useful in formulating ways to assist the united efforts of everyone to achieve decisions agreed upon by all."
    Mr. Vyshinsky went on to say: The US Secretary of State, in his speech, was not content with rudely attacking the Soviet Union; he attempted to drag us onto a path that is completely irrelevant to the current tasks of the General Assembly, especially in the current international situation, which requires us to treat international affairs and what we say with extra responsibility.
    The Soviet delegation will never follow this path. We believe that it is more important and more necessary at present to turn to the fundamental purpose for which we are gathered here, to a topic that is directly and most closely related to the answer to the question: What must the General Assembly do in the current international situation? Anyone who sincerely and genuinely wants to fulfill his responsibilities will clearly and firmly answer the strong appeal of hundreds of millions of people who hate war and yearn for peace.
    Mr. Vyshinsky further emphasized that the Soviet Union has always attached great importance to the United Nations. Mr. Vyshinsky recalled Stalin's words, saying that the Soviet Union considers the United Nations to be an important instrument for maintaining peace and international security.
    In concluding his speech, Mr. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation, on the instructions of the Soviet government, submitted the following declaration for consideration by the General Assembly, the purpose of which is to consolidate the peace and security of all peoples and avoid the threat of war.
    The "Declaration on Eliminating the Threat of a New War and Consolidating World Peace and Security" Submitted by the Soviet Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly.
    The full text of the declaration is as follows:
    "Declaration on Eliminating the Threat of a New War and Consolidating World Peace and Security.
    The General Assembly considers that the most important task of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, to consolidate and develop friendly relations between all peoples, and their joint cooperation in solving international problems. The General Assembly hereby expresses its firm determination to eliminate the threat of a new war, and supports the indomitable will for peace of the hundreds of millions of people who have signed the Stockholm Declaration expressing this desire, considers that the use of atomic weapons and other means of mass slaughter of people is the most serious international crime against humanity, and recalls the unanimous decision of the General Assembly in 1946 that atomic energy must be prohibited for military use, and notes that the events currently occurring in Korea and other parts of the Pacific region more forcefully confirm the special importance and urgency of the five great powers—the permanent members of the Security Council, who bear special responsibility for maintaining international peace—uniting in their efforts for the cause of peace and security for all peoples. The General Assembly has decided to approve the following declaration: First, the General Assembly condemns the propaganda for a new war engaged in by certain countries, and calls upon governments to prohibit such propaganda within their borders and to punish such crimes. Second, the General Assembly recognizes that the use of atomic weapons as weapons of aggression and mass destruction of mankind is contrary to the conscience and honor of mankind and inconsistent with the qualifications of a member of the United Nations, and hereby declares an unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the establishment of strict international controls to ensure the effective and unconditional implementation of this prohibition. In addition to the above, the United Nations General Assembly also declares that any government that first uses atomic weapons or any other weapons of mass destruction of people against any country shall be guilty of the crime of genocide and shall be regarded as a war criminal. Third, the United Nations General Assembly, proceeding from the necessity of consolidating peace and taking into account the special responsibility of the permanent members of the Security Council for guaranteeing peace, unanimously expresses the following wish: (a) ‘The United States, Great Britain, France, China, and the Soviet Union unite their efforts to maintain peace and conclude a treaty of peace among themselves’; (b) These great powers shall reduce their current armed forces (ground forces, military aviation of various forces, navy) by one-third in 1950, so that the issue of further reductions in armed forces can be submitted for consideration at the next session of the General Assembly."
    In conclusion, Mr. Vyshinsky called on the General Assembly to resolutely follow the path of peace and strengthening cooperation among all peoples.
    After Mr. Vyshinsky's speech, the Peruvian representative, Mr. Belaunde, delivered a lengthy speech supporting the US position.
    The next General Assembly session will be held on the afternoon of September 21.

### 在联合国大会上  苏联提出建立持久和平方案

　　在联合国大会上
    苏联提出建立持久和平方案
    一、谴责若干国家从事新战争宣传并要求惩办这种罪行
    二、无条件禁止原子武器并宣布首先使用者为战争罪犯
    三、五大国缔结和平公约并于今年各裁减军备三分之一
    【新华社二十一日讯】塔斯社纽约二十一日电：联合国大会于二十日下午举行全体会议，开始进行一般辩论。
    辩论以巴西代表佛力泰斯—凡立的演说开始，他空洞地呼吁联合国各会员国尽力消除它们的分歧，调和他们的歧见。佛力泰斯—凡立很明显地是为破坏安理会中大国一致原则的企图先作准备；他说：所谓“否决权”已被“滥用了”。但佛力泰斯—凡立表示他并不同意那些建议扩大大会职权借以破坏安理会的人们的意见。他承认“安理会是负维持和平的主要责任的机构，如果要削弱它的权力，就不可不引起危险”。
    佛力泰斯—凡立演说以后，美国代表艾奇逊发言。他提出美国的建议，主张牺牲安理会来增强大会的权力借以破坏联合国安理会中的大国一致原则。从艾奇逊的演说中，可以明显地看出：美国建议的目的是想利用联合国为掩盖美国将来侵略的外衣，以更大的规模来重演美国在朝鲜事件上所做的先例。
    艾奇逊开始时宣布忠实于联合国组织，然后用很多字眼来责骂苏联所实施的政策是给保证集体安全制度制造困难；艾奇逊实质上重复了上届大会上美英帝国主义宣传机构所提出的对苏联毫无根据的一切指责。
    作为艾奇逊演说的“积极的”一部分，他提出了四点方案，这个方案事实上是要缩小安理会的作用与重要性，并削弱联合国宪章所规定的活动。
    他的方法中的第一个建议规定：如果安理会受阻而不能在“和平遭破坏或发生侵略行为”时采取行动，就得在通知发出后二十四小时内召开大会紧急会议。
    第二项建议是成立“安全巡察队”，以便就所谓“任何有发生国际冲突之威胁的地区作观察并报告”。
    艾奇逊方案中的第三项建议是强迫每个会员国在各该国的军队中指定一些部队，“代表联合国”服务。而大家都知道，在这个联合国的大会中，机械表决制度乃是按美国的命令行事的。
    第四项建议是要求大会成立一个委员会，以便“研究和报告联合国”为采取所谓集体行动（包括使用武力的行动）而“可能使用的办法”。
    艾奇逊在其演说的结语中，建议把福摩萨（美国对台湾的称呼——编者注）问题列入大会的议程。
    接着发言的是苏联代表团团长维辛斯基，他向大会提出在全世界建立持久和平的真正的方案。维辛斯基说：“大会的工作是以一般辩论开始的，在一般辩论中，经常要总结联合国在过去一年中的活动，并规定新的任务和完成这些任务的办法。这样的交换意见可以增进各国代表团相互间的了解，并且在制定办法协助联合大家的力量以实现大家共同同意的决定方面也是有用的。”
    维辛斯基接着说：美国国务卿在他的演说中并不以粗暴地攻击苏联为已足，他企图把我们拉上与大会当前任务毫不相干的道路，特别是在目前这种国际局势的情况下，这种局势要求我们以格外负责的态度对待国际事务和我们所说的话。
    苏联代表团决不跟着这条道路走。目前我们认为更加重要更加必要的，是转到我们正是为之而在此集会的基本目的上，转到一个课题上，这个课题是与下面这个问题的答案有直接的、最密切的联系的，这个问题就是：在目前的国际局势下，大会必须作些什么呢？任何一个真想诚实而真挚地履行其责任的人，都会清楚而坚决地答复千百万憎恨战争、渴望和平的人民的强有力的呼吁。
    维辛斯基进而着重指出：苏联过去和现在都非常重视联合国。维辛斯基追述斯大林的话说：苏联认为联合国是维持和平和国际安全的重要的工具。
    维辛斯基在结束其演说时说：苏联代表团奉苏联政府的训令提出下列宣言，请大会考虑，这个宣言的目的在于巩固各族人民的和平与安全，避免战争的威胁。
    苏联代表团在联合国大会上提出的
    “制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言”全文
    宣言全文如下：
    “制止新战争威胁、巩固世界和平与安全的宣言。
    大会认为联合国最重要的任务乃是维持国际和平与安全，巩固和发展各族人民之间的友好关系，以及它们之间的共同合作，以解决国际上的问题。大会兹表示其制止新战争威胁的坚定决心，并支持在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名表示此种愿望的数亿人民对于和平的不屈不挠的意志，认为使用原子武器以及其他大规模屠杀人民的手段，乃是对人类所犯的最严重的国际罪行，并追溯一九四六年大会关于必须禁止原子能供军事使用的一致决定，注意及目前在朝鲜以及其他太平洋地区所发生的事件，更有力地证实了五大国——在维持国际和平上负有特殊责任的安全理事会常任理事国——联合为各族人民的和平与安全事业而努力的特殊重要性和迫切性。大会特决定批准下列宣言：第一，大会谴责若干国家所从事的新战争宣传，并呼吁各国政府禁止各该国内部的这种宣传，并惩办此种罪行。第二，大会承认使用作为侵略及大规模毁灭人类的武器的原子武器，是违反人类的良心和荣誉，而且不合乎联合国会员国资格的，兹特宣布无条件禁止原子武器，并建立严格的国际管制，以确实而无条件地实施这一禁令。除上述各项以外，联合国大会并宣布：凡对任何国家首先使用原子武器或任何其他大规模杀害人民的武器的政府，均为犯有屠杀人类罪行，而将被视为战争罪犯。第三，联合国大会从巩固和平的必要出发，并且考虑到安全理事会常任理事国在保证和平上负有特殊责任，特一致表示下述愿望：甲，‘美、英、法、中、苏联合它们的和平努力，并在彼此之间缔结一个巩固和平的公约’；乙，这些大国在一九五○年把它们目前的武装部队（地面部队、各种部队的军用航空队、海军）裁减三分之一，以便在大会最近的一届会议上把武装部队再行裁减的问题提出审议。”
    维辛斯基在结语中呼吁大会坚决地走和平与加强各族人民间的合作之路。
    在维辛斯基发言之后，秘鲁代表碧朗第发表冗长演说，支持美国的立场。
    下一次大会会议将在九月二十一日下午举行。
