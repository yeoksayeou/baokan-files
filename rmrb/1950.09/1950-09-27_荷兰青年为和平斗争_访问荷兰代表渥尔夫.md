　　Dutch Youth Fight for Peace
    Interview with Dutch Representative Woolf

    "After the Dutch government signed the North Atlantic Treaty, the anti-war movement of students unfolded fiercely across the country," Woolf told me forcefully as his first remark.

    He said: "The Dutch reactionary government's military expenditure accounts for 41.8 percent of the total budget annually, while the budget for education accounts for only 9.2 percent. When Truman clamored for expanding armaments, the Dutch government, under the threat and lure of American imperialism, also expanded its army by three divisions, and military production is also increasing desperately. Various domestic industries are being transformed into military industries. Especially the metal industry, almost all of them have been changed into military industries. The Dutch Minister of the Army revealed his true colors at a press conference, saying: "The manpower of the Netherlands is very large and strong." This fully proves that the Dutch government is determined to follow behind the American imperialists and send Dutch youth to be cannon fodder."

    However, despite the clamoring, the forces for peace are rapidly strengthening day by day. Because the Dutch people resolutely oppose war, when Woolf left the Netherlands on August 2nd, 241,168 people had signed the peace petition. By August 23rd, it had increased to 315,296 people. The progress was slower at the beginning of the signature campaign, but after the Korean War broke out, when the Dutch people heard that American imperialism was brutally bombing peace-loving people in Korea, a wave of enthusiasm for peace signatures quickly arose. Even miners in very remote mines signed the peace declaration. But the Dutch reactionary government, fearing the people, used all kinds of despicable methods to persecute supporters of the peace cause. There is a very famous musician in the Netherlands who regularly leads his orchestra in performances on the radio. Because he is the chairman of the Dutch Peace Committee and also signed the peace declaration, the reactionary government forced the radio station not to broadcast his music anymore. There is also an even uglier example: In a program of a radio station in the Dutch capital, a play was broadcast every week. Once, the actress who played the female lead in a play was a young woman who had participated in the peace movement. The reactionary government was afraid of her and wanted to drive her away, but they were also afraid of protests from the radio listeners. So, they came up with a strange idea and ordered the author of the play to rewrite the script, changing the living female lead in the play into a dead person, so that this young woman who participated in the peace movement could no longer perform. The Dutch people said angrily: "You can only kill the people in the play, but the great force of peace is always alive."

    The Marshall Plan has brought enormous disasters and poverty to the Dutch people. The average worker's consumption of oil and meat per week in 1949 was reduced to 50 to 55 percent of the average in 1938. Workers' wages in 1949 were also 38 percent lower than in 1930; while the production volume in 1949 only increased by 1 percent compared to the production volume in 1929 over the past twenty years. The potato farmland area in 1949 was also reduced by 200,000 hectares compared to 1948. Today, the Netherlands is facing a serious economic crisis under the exploitation of the Marshall Plan.

    The young Dutch workers are constantly launching struggles to demand improved living conditions and demand peace. Especially the female workers in the clothing factories are very brave in the struggle. Most of them are members of the Youth League. In December last year, many young people were arrested and sentenced to three to five years in prison for opposing the Dutch government's engagement in colonial wars in Indonesia.

    Woolf said: "But progressive youth all over the world are supporting us. We are particularly grateful to the All-China Youth Federation for its assistance. It sent a telegram to the Netherlands to protest the Dutch government's unreasonable arrest."

    Woolf continued: "On July 23rd, despite the suppression of the reactionary government, the Dutch people held two mass rallies to protest the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea. Each meeting was attended by more than 5,000 people. Despite different religious beliefs and different political views, the Dutch youth of today have united closely to launch a struggle for peace."

    Woolf said excitedly: "The victory of the Chinese people has given the Dutch youth great strength. The Dutch people know that the victory of the Chinese people directly weakens the American imperialism and the Dutch reactionary government's ruling power in Southeast Asia." He said: When the Asian Women's Conference was held last year, Dutch representatives came to participate. After the representatives returned, they reported on the situation of the new China at many mass rallies. Woolf expressed that after he goes back this time, he will use greater efforts to introduce the achievements of the construction of the new China to all the Dutch people." (with picture)

### 荷兰青年为和平斗争  访问荷兰代表渥尔夫

　　荷兰青年为和平斗争
    访问荷兰代表渥尔夫
    “荷兰政府在北大西洋公约上签字以后，学生们的反战运动，就在全国激烈地展开了。”渥尔夫第一句话就这样有力地告诉我。
    他说：“荷兰的反动政府每年在军事上的开支，占全部预算的百分之四十一点八，而用在教育上的预算，却只占百分之九点二。当杜鲁门扩充军备的叫嚣发出后，荷兰政府也在美帝国主义的威胁利诱下扩充了三个师的军队；军事生产量也在拚命增加。国内的各种工业，正在改变为军事工业，特别是金属工业，差不多都改成了军事工业。荷兰的陆军部长在一次的记者招待会上原形毕露地说：“荷兰的人力是很多而且很强的。”这充分证明了荷兰政府是要决心跟随美帝国主义者之后，把荷兰青年送去做炮灰的。”
    但是，叫嚣尽管叫嚣；和平的力量是在一天天地迅速增强。因为荷兰人民坚决反对战争，在渥尔夫八月二日离开荷兰时，参加和平签名的人有二十四万一千一百六十八人，到八月二十三日已经增加到三十一万五千二百九十六人。在签名运动开始时进展比较慢，但从朝鲜战争发生以后，荷兰人民听到美帝国主义残暴地轰炸朝鲜爱好和平的人们时，和平签名的热潮便迅速地掀起来了。即使在很远的矿场上的矿工们也都在和平宣言上签了名。但是惧怕人民的荷兰反动政府，却用了种种卑鄙的办法来迫害和平事业拥护者。荷兰有一位很有名的音乐家，他是经常领导他的一个管弦乐队在广播电台演奏的。因为他是荷兰和平委员会的主席，又在和平宣言上签了名，反动政府就迫令广播台不准再广播他的音乐。另外还有一个更丑恶的例子：在荷兰首都的一家电台的节目里，每周要广播一个剧。有一次一个剧里女主角的演员是参加过和平运动的一位女青年。反动政府害怕她，想把她赶走；但又害怕电台的听众抗议。于是异想天开地下令那个剧的作者，重新修改剧本，把剧中活着的女主角，改写成一个死去的人，使这位参加和运的女青年无法再演下去了。荷兰人民气愤地说：“你只能叫剧中的人死去，巨大的和平力量却是永远活着的。”
    马歇尔计划给荷兰人民带来了莫大的灾难与贫困。一般工人生活，在一九四九年每周吃的油和肉，比一九三八年平均减少到百分之五十到五十五。一九四九年的工人工资也比一九三○年减少百分之三八；而一九四九年的生产量和一九二九年的生产量相比，二十年来只增加了百分之一，一九四九年的洋芋耕地面积，比一九四八年又减少了二十万公顷。今天的荷兰在马歇尔计划的榨压下，已经招来了一个严重的经济危机。
    荷兰的青年工人们，正在不断地为要求改善生活，要求和平而展开斗争，特别是那些被服厂的女工们在斗争中表现非常勇敢，她们之中大部分都是青年联盟的盟员。在去年十二月，青年们为了反对荷兰政府到印尼去从事殖民地战争，好多人都被逮捕了，并且判了三年到五年的徒刑。
    渥尔夫说：“但是全世界进步青年是支持我们的。我们特别感谢中华全国民主青年联合总会给我们的援助，它打电报到荷兰，抗议荷兰政府的无理拘捕。”
    渥尔夫继续说：“七月二十三日，不顾反动政府的镇压，荷兰人民举行了两个群众大会，抗议美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜，每一个会都有五千以上的群众参加；尽管有不同的宗教信仰，不同的政治看法，今天的荷兰青年，已经紧紧地团结在一起为和平事业而展开斗争了。”
    渥尔夫兴奋地说：“中国人民的胜利，给了荷兰青年很大的力量；荷兰人民知道：中国人民的胜利，就是直接削弱了美国帝国主义和荷兰反动政府在东南亚的统治力量。他说：去年亚洲妇代会开会时，荷兰有代表来参加，代表回去之后，在很多群众大会上报告了新中国的情况。渥尔夫表示：他这次回去后，要用更大的力量，把新中国建设的成就，介绍给全荷兰人民。”（附图片）
