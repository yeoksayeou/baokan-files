　　Mao Zedong Steamer (Serial Novel)
    Ding Kexin, Qingying

  Twenty-seven, "What are the benefits of joining the Communist Party?"

    Guo Shude seized the opportunity to help the old hero establish a learning system on the train, and often held study meetings.

    Initially, the results were not very good. First of all, Lao Shang was not enthusiastic about learning. He got tired of hearing about the Kuomintang and the United States. He thought, "No one says they are bad. We rely on skills to make a living. With ability, we can get by anywhere. Whoever pays the money, we'll work for them. What's the point of talking about those things?..."

    At this time, many railway workers ran from Changchun and other places to the liberated areas (Changchun was surrounded by our army). The workers in Harbin held meetings to welcome them and also held symposiums.

    After these meetings, Lao Shang was troubled for many days. While driving the train, eating, and especially when lying on the bunk and closing his eyes, his mind would replay the scenes of the accusations at the meeting: those worker brothers who had escaped were all yellow and thin, their clothes were torn and dirty, and they wanted to cry when they spoke. They said, "The Kuomintang is more ruthless than the Japanese, trampling the poor people under their feet and not treating them as human beings!" They said, "Workers starve to death, freeze to death, countless numbers!" They cried and said, "We regret it, we regret going from Harbin to Changchun, throwing ourselves into the trap! ...We are sorry for Chairman Mao!..."

    At another study meeting, Lao Shang scolded himself, saying that he had been confused for thirty years, and even more than two years after liberation, he still believed that politics could not be eaten. He had not studied well even after participating in the study meetings. Let's see what happens in the future! ...

    Everyone also encouraged each other:

    "Whoever doesn't study is letting down Chairman Mao..."

    Old hero Li Yong also said:

    "I now know that the Communist Party is really good! ...If Guo Da hadn't come, who knows what the Mao Zedong Steamer would have become? Now everyone is very nice to me, and my temper has also improved a lot. Now I don't accept being old, and I must also work hard to learn."

    Lao Zheng thought to himself: Strange, since Guo Shude and the others came, the old hero has indeed become much better, and Lao Shang is also a little different. Guo Da is really good: first, his attitude is good and he doesn't lose his temper; second, he criticizes people fairly and reasonably; third, he is responsible for his work and does what he says; fourth, he doesn't do business or smuggle. Take the criticism meetings and study meetings, for example, although they are a bit troublesome, they are also beneficial. This Communist Party is really strange! ...

    After the study meeting, he found Guo Shude.

    He first asked why the Kuomintang wanted to oppress workers, why Chiang Kai-shek wanted to collude with the United States, etc. Guo Shude answered what he knew, and said he didn't know what he couldn't answer, and would ask Representative Zhang and the chairman of the trade union and tell him later. He also advised him to practice reading newspapers and books more.

    Then Lao Zheng asked with great interest:

    "What are the benefits of joining the Communist Party?"

    Guo Shude said:

    "There are no other benefits, just work hard to study and seek progress, and do more work to serve the people."

    He went back and asked Lao Shang, and Lao Shang said:

    "The Communist Party is indeed good, it can make people with backward thinking progress."

    "Then why don't you join the Party?"

    "Me? I'm a carefree person. The Communist Party's discipline is too strict, I'm afraid I can't bear it."

    "Yes," Lao Zheng jumped up, "I'm also afraid of that discipline."

    "It doesn't matter to you, join."

    "No, what if joining the Party means they transfer me far away? What will happen to my family?"

    "This," Lao Shang laughed, he likes to joke: "You are not a saint, the backward elements are not wanted, don't worry."

    Lao Zheng was a little annoyed and said unconvinced:

    "I am backward, you are not much stronger than me! Without you, maybe I would have made progress earlier."

    Lao Shang felt a little harsh and said angrily:

    "Get out of here, don't give me any more trouble!"

    "Who are you scolding?" Lao Zheng didn't give in either: "I can live without you!"

    The two parted unhappily. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）
    丁克辛  轻影作
  二十七、“参加共产党有什么好处？”
    郭树德又抓紧机会帮助老英雄在车上建立了学习制度，经常开学习会。
    一开始成绩不大好，首先老商对学习就提不上劲，一听到老讲国民党和美国就腻的慌；他想：“谁也不说自己不好，咱靠技术吃饭，有本领到哪也吃得开，谁开钱给谁干，老讲那些有什么意思？……”
    正在这时候，有好多铁路工人从长春等地跑到解放区来（长春被我大军包围着），哈尔滨工友们开会欢迎，还开座谈会。
    这些会过后，老商苦恼了不少日子；开着车，吃着饭，尤其是躺到铺上合上眼，脑子一转就是会上诉苦的情景：那些逃出来的工人弟兄，一个个又黄又瘦，衣服又破又脏，一说话就想哭。听他们说：“国民党比日本还狠，把穷人百姓踩在脚底下不当人！”听他们说：“工人饿死，冻死，无其数！”听他们哭着说：“悔不该，悔不该从哈尔滨跑到长春去，自投罗网！……对不起毛主席！……”
    在又一次学习会上，老商骂了他自己，说自己糊涂了三十年，解放以后两年多，还一直认为政治不能当饭吃，参加了学习会也没有好好的学习，看以后的吧！……
    大家也都互相勉励：
    “谁不学习谁就对不起毛主席，……”
    李永老英雄也说：
    “我此刻才知道共产党真正好！……郭大车要不来，谁知道毛泽东号会变成个什么样？如今大家对我都很好，我的脾气也改多了，现在我不服老，也一定要努力学习。”
    老郑在一边想：奇怪，自从郭树德他们一来，老英雄的确变得好多了，老商也有点不同了；郭大车果真是好：第一、态度好不发脾气；第二、批评人公平合理；第三、工作负责说到做到；第四、不做买卖不走私。就说批评会学习会吧，虽说有点麻烦，却是也有好处，这共产党就是怪！……
    学习会以后，他就找到郭树德。
    他先问一些为什么国民党要压迫工人，蒋介石要勾结美国等问题，郭树德把知道的回答了，不知道的就说他也说不清，等去问了张代表和工会主任再告诉他，并且劝他要练习多看报看书。
    接着老郑就满有兴趣的问：
    “参加共产党到底有什么好处？”
    郭树德说：
    “也没有别的好处，就是努力学习求进步，多干活为人民服务。”
    他回去又去问老商，老商说：
    “共产党确是好，能叫思想落后的人进步。”
    “那你为什么不入党？”
    “我？我这人吊儿浪当，共产党纪律太严，我怕受不了。”
    “对，”老郑跳起来，“我也是怕那纪律。”
    “你不要紧，入吧。”
    “不，入了党要是把我调远了，扔下一大家子人怎么办？”
    “这个，”老商笑了，他爱开个玩笑：“你又不圣人了，落后分子人家不要，放心吧。”
    老郑有点恼，不服气地说：
    “我落后，你比我也不强啊！没有你，说不定我早进步了。”
    老商听着有点刺耳，生气地说：
    “去你的吧，以后少给我扯皮！”
    “你训谁？”老郑也不让：“离了你一样过日子！”
    两个人不欢而散。（附图片）
