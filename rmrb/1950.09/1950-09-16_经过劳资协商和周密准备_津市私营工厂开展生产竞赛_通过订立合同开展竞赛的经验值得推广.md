(From Our Newspaper Tianjin) Under the call of the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, private factories in Tianjin have smoothly launched a production emulation drive after labor-management consultation and careful preparation. Following the launch of production emulation drives in large factories such as Hengyuan, Beiyang Cotton Mill, and Dongya Enterprise Company, medium and small factories such as Guangming Vegetable Oil Factory, Yida Weaving Factory, Hongsheng Textile Factory, Dafu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Dasheng Weaving Factory, Yaguang Iron Factory, and Xinghua Iron Factory have also launched production emulation drives one after another. In addition, thirty factories in the hardware, textile, and other industries are preparing to launch production emulation drives in September.

In factories that have launched production emulation drives, workers' production enthusiasm is high, and they generally abide by labor discipline automatically. Some factories have already seen improvements in output and quality, the scrap rate has begun to decrease, the confidence of capitalists in management has increased, and workers' welfare has gradually recovered and improved. On August 19, the private Yaguang Iron Factory signed a production contract between labor and management and launched a production emulation drive. All workers were able to go to work on time and start working immediately after arriving at the factory, overcoming the past phenomenon of waiting for the capitalists to assign work. Production efficiency has now increased by 25%. With the development of production, the factory has added 14 workers. The private Dafu Dyeing and Weaving Factory launched a production emulation drive on August 25, and production efficiency increased by 38%, and the sub-standard cloth rate has dropped to 2% (originally stipulated as 5%). After Hongsheng Weaving Factory launched the emulation drive on August 18, the daily output per machine increased from 40 yards to 45 yards, and the warping increased from 14 skeins to 18 skeins. The Guangming Vegetable Oil Factory, under the circumstances of workers' active production, began to expand its business and added 500 million yuan of capital. Dasheng Weaving Factory has been continuously launching production emulation drives as early as May this year, and the factory is gradually developing. The number of employees has increased from 16 to 49, the number of canvas machines has increased from 4 to 18, and the output of each worker has increased from a maximum of 34 yards before the emulation drive to 77 yards. In terms of quality, not a single piece of defective cloth has been produced since the emulation drive.

The production emulation drives in these small and medium-sized factories have their own characteristics: some conduct production emulation drives by signing production contracts between labor and management. Because it is difficult for small and medium-sized private factories to have a long-term production plan, the work they do is almost all processing orders, and the production objects are not fixed, so it is impossible to have a long-term and careful plan. Therefore, signing a production contract is very necessary, but the content of the contract should be clear, simple, and concise. After signing the contract, the private Yaguang Iron Factory played a great role in production. The workers abided by labor discipline, were able to go to work on time, cleaned the machines very cleanly, and actively put forward rationalization proposals to the capitalists. The capitalists regularly supplied sufficient raw materials, improved labor organization, divided production groups, and implemented a responsibility system, making the allocation of labor more perfect. However, the disadvantage of the factory's production contract is the lack of reward and punishment measures. Some factories have learned from the experience of large factories in the emulation drive in order to improve and deepen the emulation movement. After the launch of the production emulation drive in the Dafu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, eight production groups, including weaving, winding, warping, tassel making, heddling, finishing, repairing, and management, established a liaison contract after detailed discussions among the workers, and the specific distribution of production tasks and the implementation of labor discipline were signed into the liaison contract, strengthening mutual supervision and inspection among the workers, thus ensuring the smooth completion of the production plan. Some factories organize technical study groups and sign apprenticeship contracts to consolidate the production emulation drive, improve product quality, and improve workers' skills, further mobilizing veteran workers. For example, in order to continuously improve the quality of products, the workers of Dasheng Weaving Factory mobilized the veteran worker Gong Wancheng to regularly lecture on technology, which improved the enthusiasm of all workers to learn technology. After work every day, they automatically repaired the machines, wiped off rust, and oiled them. Therefore, in the several months of the emulation drive, not a single piece of defective cloth was produced. Because everyone's skills have improved, the workers in charge of the combined thread machine could only watch 20 spindles per day in the past, but in the emulation drive, they can watch 40; the wheel line workers increased from two people turning four shafts a day to one person turning four shafts.

After the launch of the production emulation drive, the capitalists of each factory felt that it was profitable and their management enthusiasm increased. In order to implement the policy of benefiting both labor and management and consolidate the emulation drive, each factory should promptly change its management methods, abolish the unreasonable systems existing in wages, working hours, and personnel, establish some new systems, and formulate reward measures. The working hours of Yaguang Iron Factory were shortened from 10 hours to 9 hours; Hongsheng Dyeing and Weaving Factory gave workers a bonus of 1.56 million yuan in two weeks of the emulation drive; Dasheng Weaving Factory implemented a more production, more reward method, and the workers' production enthusiasm has always been high, and the capitalists' profits have also been continuously increasing. After the launch of the emulation drive, Dafu Dyeing and Weaving Factory implemented preliminary democratic management, formulated specific reward measures, and labor and management fully utilized the consultation meeting. At the meeting, the capitalist representative reported on the business situation, the labor representative reported on the workers' production situation, and solved some major problems in production. Now other factories that have launched production emulation drives are also moving in this direction. Individual factories that have launched emulation drives have had tendencies and shortcomings of simply pursuing quantity, neglecting quality, not paying attention to machinery and equipment, lacking production records, and not considering product sales, which should be paid attention to by factories that are preparing to launch emulation drives.

　　经过劳资协商和周密准备
    津市私营工厂开展生产竞赛
    通过订立合同开展竞赛的经验值得推广
    【本报天津讯】天津私营工厂生产竞赛在市总工会号召下，经过劳资协商和周密准备后，已顺利展开。继恒源、北洋纱厂及东亚企业公司等大厂开展生产竞赛之后，光明植物油厂、义大织布厂、洪甡纺织厂、大蚨织染厂、达生织布厂、亚光铁工厂、兴华铁工厂等中小型工厂也已先后展开生产竞赛。另有五金、纺织等行业三十个工厂，准备在九月份内开展生产竞赛。
    开展生产竞赛的工厂，工人生产情绪高涨，一般都能自动地遵守劳动纪律，有些厂产量质量已见提高，废品率开始降低，资方经营信心提高，工人福利也渐有恢复和改善。私营亚光铁工厂八月十九日劳资双方签订了生产合同，展开了生产竞赛，全体工友都能按时上下班，到班后马上干活，克服了过去等待资方派活的现象，生产效率现已提高百分之二十五；随着生产的发展，该厂已增添十四名工人。私营大蚨织染厂八月二十五日开展了生产竞赛，生产效率提高百分之三十八，次布率已降为百分之二（原规定百分之五）。洪生织布厂八月十八日开展竞赛以后，每台机日产量由四十码提高到四十五码，整经由十四绞达到十八绞。光明植物油厂资方在工人积极生产情况下，开始扩大营业，新增加资本五亿元。达生织布厂早在今年五月即不断地展开了生产竞赛，厂子在逐渐发展。职工由十六人增加到四十九人，帆布机四台增加到十八台，每个工人的生产量由竞赛前最高织三十四码，提高到七十七码，在质量上自竞赛以来没有出过一匹残布。
    这些中小型工厂的生产竞赛各有特点：有的是通过劳资双方订立生产合同，展开生产竞赛。因为在私营的中小型工厂，很难有一个较长期的生产计划，所作的活差不多都是加工定货，生产对象不固定，就不可能有一个长远的周密计划，因之签订生产合同非常必要，但合同的内容目标要明确、简单、扼要。私营亚光铁工厂签订合同后，在生产上起了很大作用，工人们遵守劳动纪律，都能按时上下班，机器打扫的很干净，并积极向资方提出合理化建议。资方定期供足原料，改善了劳动组织，划分了生产小组，实行了负责制，使劳动力的分配更臻完善。但该厂生产合同的缺点是缺少奖惩办法。有的厂子为了把竞赛运动提高和深入一步，学习了大工厂竞赛的经验。大蚨织染厂生产竞赛展开后，织布、打络、整经、打穗、掏综、整理、修理、管理等八个生产小组，经过工友们的详细讨论，建立了联系合同，把生产任务的具体分配，劳动纪律的执行，都签订到联系合同里面，加强了工友间的互相督促与检查，因此保证了生产计划的顺利完成。有的厂子则组织技术学习会，订立师徒合同，巩固生产竞赛，提高产品质量，提高工人技术，更进一步把老工人发动起来。如达生织布厂工人为了使产品质量不断提高，把老工人巩万成发动起来，经常讲授技术，提高了全体工友学习技术的情绪，每天下班后都自动地修理机器，擦锈上油，因此在几个月的竞赛当中，没有出一匹残布。由于大家的技术提高，管合线机的工人过去一人一天只看二十个锭子，竞赛中就可看到四十个；轮线的由两人一天轮四轴提高到一人轮四轴。
    生产竞赛展开以后，各厂资方感到有利可图，经营情绪提高。为贯彻劳资两利政策，巩固竞赛，各工厂尚应及时改变管理方法，取消在工资、工时及人事等方面存在着的不合理制度，建立一些新的制度，制定奖励办法。亚光铁工厂工作时间由十小时缩短为九小时；洪甡染织厂在竞赛两周中，给工人发奖一百五十六万元；达生织布厂实行多产多奖办法，工人生产情绪始终高涨，资方利润也不断增加。大蚨织染厂展开竞赛后，实行了初步的民主管理，制定了具体的奖励办法，劳资双方充分利用协商会议，在会上资方代表报告营业情况，劳方代表报告工人生产情况，解决生产上一些大问题。现在其他展开生产竞赛的工厂也正向这个方向迈进。个别展开竞赛的工厂曾发生单纯追求数量，忽视质量，不重视机器设备，缺乏生产纪录，未考虑产品销路等偏向和缺点，应引起各正准备展开竞赛的工厂的注意。（天津市总工会：郭韵江、李祥、郝学忠、闻宇）
