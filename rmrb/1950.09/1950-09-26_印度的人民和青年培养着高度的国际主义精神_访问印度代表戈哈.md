    Indian People and Youth Cultivate a High Degree of Internationalism
    Interview with Indian Representative Goha
    Comrade Goha first introduced to the reporter the history of the Indian people and youth's century-long struggle against colonialism and for national independence. As early as 1857, within the British army that included Indian soldiers, there was a spontaneous, large-scale struggle against the rule of British colonialists. From 1919 to 1922, precisely when World War I ended and the Great October Revolution achieved victory, the Indian people launched their first organized mass movement against British imperialism. From 1939, a vast number of young people enthusiastically participated in the national liberation movement. Indian students rose up one after another to oppose the British colonial education system and demanded the release of political prisoners. At that time, the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan for national liberation also greatly encouraged the Indian people. Indian poets even wrote many poems praising the heroic resistance of the Chinese people and introduced the works of Chinese writers.

    After the end of World War II, the Indian people still did not gain freedom and continued to suffer cruel exploitation and oppression. On February 21, 1946, Indian soldiers in the British Navy in Mumbai held a vigorous and heroic uprising, which received a wide response from workers, peasants, and students. The World Federation of Democratic Youth has designated this day as the Day of Struggle Against Colonialism to commemorate this great struggle.

    When speaking of the aggression of American imperialism against the Asian people, Goha immediately pointed out that after World War II, the forces of American imperialism gradually infiltrated India as well. American capitalists invested heavily in India and opened 72 companies, controlling more than one-third of India's import and export trade. American bank capital and Indian bureaucratic capital were even more closely colluding. The World Bank, controlled by American imperialism, subsequently signed many contracts with the Indian government, turning India into a source of raw materials. Under the cruel oppression of British and American imperialism and domestic reactionaries, the lives of the Indian people became increasingly impoverished, and the anti-imperialist movement grew stronger and stronger.

    In 1947 and 1948, workers in Mumbai and Calcutta held a continuous 40-day strike, demanding increased wages and reduced working hours. In 1949, the Indian government, in accordance with the wishes of imperialism, promulgated a reactionary anti-union bill to suppress the workers' movement. The All-India Trade Union Congress called on workers to unite and fight against the anti-union bill. Young workers played an active role in this struggle.

    The most prominent aspect of the Indian youth struggle is the Indian student movement. From August 1948 to August 1949, a nationwide wave of strikes unfolded, with nearly two million people participating. The student movement is led by the All-India Student Federation, which already has nearly 100,000 members and publishes the magazine "Student." In addition to fighting for their own right to education, the biggest characteristic of Indian students is their close integration with the struggles of workers and peasants, especially following the workers' movement. Workers and students often fought side by side and supported each other.

    The anti-imperialist struggles of Indian young workers, peasants, and students are mostly carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party of India. The CPI educates youth that they must work among the broad masses of the people, unite people from all walks of life to form a strong anti-imperialist united front, and only then can they finally defeat the colonial system and achieve the complete liberation of Indian youth and the people. And they must pay attention to exposing the imperialists and their running dogs' conspiracies to use Indian and Muslim religions to sow discord among the Indian people. Today, a major slogan has become popular among Indian youth: "The path of the Chinese people's struggle is the path of the Indian people's struggle." They are determined to learn from the experience of the struggle of Chinese youth and the people and take the struggle of Chinese youth and the people as their example.

    In the common struggle against colonialism and imperialist oppression, Indian youth have gained a deep understanding and cultivated a high degree of internationalism. Indian youth have organized a movement to support the fighting youth of Spain and launched a movement to support the youth and people of Vietnam and Indonesia, opposing the aggression and persecution of the youth and people of Vietnam and Indonesia by French and Dutch imperialism. And they designate January 20th as Vietnam Day every year. Recently, when British imperialism sent troops to suppress the people of Malaya, Indian youth and the people organized mass rallies to publicize their resistance to the war of aggression.

    Indian youth and the people also understand that the current movement to defend world peace is inseparable from the struggles they are waging today. Last April, after the World Peace Congress closed, an All-India Peace Congress, prepared by the All-India Trade Union Congress and other organizations, was subsequently held in India. Indian student and youth organizations actively participated in this congress. The congress called on the Indian people to oppose the propaganda of war, racial hatred, and military agreements, alliances, and conventions that undermine the United Nations. The congress severely condemned the war-mongering policies of the British and American warmongers to use atomic bombs for intimidation and launch aggression. Zhangge, the representative of East Punjab Province, said at the meeting: "The youth of East Punjab Province will never fight for the interests of imperialism, capitalists, and landlords. We support the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and we will never fight against the Soviet Union under any circumstances!" After the congress closed, a widespread peace signature campaign was immediately launched. So far, more than one million people have signed their names.

    Comrade Goha finally told the reporter in particular that the glorious victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War greatly encouraged Indian youth. They had enthusiastically celebrated the founding of the People's Republic of China and had requested the Indian government to establish diplomatic relations with our country and to recommend to the United Nations that our country participate in various UN agencies. He said that Indian youth realize that the victory of the Chinese people will accelerate the process of victory for the Indian people, and they all regard this victory as their own victory. Indian youth will more closely unite with Chinese youth, Asian youth, and the people of oppressed nations in Asia in the future to fight to the end for the complete defeat of British and American imperialism!

### 印度的人民和青年培养着高度的国际主义精神  访问印度代表戈哈

专栏：世界青联代表访问记

    印度的人民和青年培养着高度的国际主义精神
    访问印度代表戈哈
    戈哈同志首先对记者介绍了印度人民和青年百年来反对殖民制度、争取民族独立的运动的历史。当一八五七年，在有着印度人参加的英国军队中，就有过自发的、大规模反对英国殖民者统治的斗争。一九一九到一九二二年，正当世界第一次大战结束，伟大的十月革命取得胜利的时期，印度人民第一次发动了有组织的广大群众的反抗英帝国主义的运动。从一九三九年起，广大青年热烈地参加了民族解放运动。印度学生纷纷起来反对英国殖民地的教育制度，要求释放政治犯。当时中国人民进行的抗日的民族解放战争，也大大鼓舞了印度人民。印度诗人们并写了很多歌颂中国人民英雄抗战的诗歌，介绍中国作家的创作。
    第二次大战结束，印度人民还是没有得到自由，同样遭到残酷的剥削和压迫。一九四六年二月二十一日，孟买市英国海军中的印度士兵举行了轰轰烈烈的英雄起义，获得工人、农民、学生的广泛响应。世界民主青年联盟为了纪念这个伟大的斗争，已规定这一天作为反对殖民制度斗争日。
    当说到美帝国主义对亚洲人民的侵略时，戈哈当即指出，在第二次大战后，美帝国主义势力也逐渐侵入印度。美国资本家在印度大量投资，并开设了七十二家公司，操纵了印度三分之一以上的进出口贸易。美国银行资本与印度官僚资本更有着密切的勾结。美帝控制下的世界银行随之和印度政府订立许多合同，把印度变成了原料供给地。在美英帝国主义和国内反动派的残酷压榨下，印度人民生活愈见降低，而反帝运动也就愈来愈高涨了。
    在一九四七和四八年，孟买市和加尔各答的工人曾举行连续四十天的罢工，要求增加工资，减少工作时间。一九四九年，印度政府遵照帝国主义的意旨，公布了反动的反工会法案，用以镇压工人运动。全印总工会号召工人团结起来，进行反对反工会法案的斗争。青年工人在这个斗争中起了积极的作用。
    印度青年斗争中最突出的一环，就是印度的学生运动。一九四八年八月到四九年八月一年间，全国各地风起云涌地展开了罢课运动，先后有二百万人参加。领导学生运动的是全印学联，它已经拥有将近十万个会员，并发行机关刊物《学生》。印度学生除了争取本身受教育的权利以外，最大的特点是和工农的斗争紧密结合，特别是追随工人阶级的运动，工人与学生时常并肩作战、互相支援。
    印度青年工人、农民和学生的反帝斗争，大都在印度共产党领导下进行的。印共教育青年必须在广大的人民中间进行工作，团结各阶层人民组成坚强的反帝统一战线，才能最后战胜殖民制度，取得印度青年和人民的完全解放。并且要注意揭破帝国主义及其走狗利用印、回宗教，来进行挑拨离间印度人民的阴谋毒计。今天，印度青年中间已流行了一个主要的口号：“中国人民斗争的道路，就是印度人民斗争的道路。”他们决心学习中国青年和人民斗争的经验，把中国青年和人民的斗争作为他们的榜样。
    在反对殖民制度、反对帝国主义压迫的共同斗争中，印度青年有了深刻的认识，培养了高度的国际主义精神。印度青年曾组织了支援西班牙战斗青年的运动，发动了支援越南、印尼青年和人民的运动，以反对法、荷帝国主义对越南印尼青年和人民的侵略和迫害。并且以每年一月二十日为越南日。最近，英帝国主义派兵去镇压马来亚人民时，印度青年和人民组织了群众大会，宣传抵制侵略战争。
    印度青年和人民并且了解，现阶段保卫世界和平运动和他们今天进行的斗争是分不开的。去年四月，世界拥护和平大会闭幕后，在印度随即召开了由全印总工会等团体筹备的全印拥护和平大会。印度学生、青年团体积极参加了这个大会。大会号召印度人民反对宣传战争、种族仇视、反对破坏联合国机构的军事协定、同盟及公约。大会严厉斥责了美英战争贩子用原子弹吓诈以及发动侵略的政策。东木札布省的代表章格在会上说：“东木札布省的青年永远不会为帝国主义、资本家及地主的利益去作战。我们拥护以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，我们无论在任何条件下也决不对苏联作战！”大会闭幕以后，随即展开了广泛的和平签名运动。到现在已有一百万人以上签了名。
    戈哈同志最后特别告诉记者，中国人民解放战争的光辉胜利，大大鼓舞了印度青年。他们曾热烈庆贺过中华人民共和国的成立，并曾要求印度政府与我国建立邦交，要求印度政府向联合国建议让我国参加联合国各种机构。他说，印度青年认识到中国人民的胜利，将要加速印度人民胜利的进程，他们都把这个胜利当作自己的胜利。印度青年今后将更亲密地和中国青年、亚洲青年团结起来，和亚洲被压迫民族的人民在一起，为完全战胜美英帝国主义而奋斗到底！（附图片）
