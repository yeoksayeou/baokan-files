    Why Can't Rationalization Proposals Be Implemented?

    Editor:

    Since the publicly owned Shandong Electric Appliance Factory established its Factory Management Committee in April, many serious problems have remained unresolved. I am now informing you of the main facts:

    The factory issued a call in May to launch rationalization proposals. However, because the factory's leading cadres have consistently failed to value the opinions of workers in the past, and this time only issued a general call without in-depth mobilization or reviewing past undemocratic practices, the masses still have various concerns in their minds. Many workers say, "What's the point of making suggestions? It's the same old story, they say it but don't do it." Some individual workers are even afraid and dare not express their opinions. In June, the Factory Management Committee plenary meeting decided to establish a "Rationalization Proposal Promotion Committee" and promotion groups; however, the result was that it was still not implemented. In July, the leadership listed the promotion of rationalization proposals as the central task for July, but until now, this work has still not been carried out, and some workers even do not know what "rationalization" is. (In these few months, there have only been two suggestions, but the leadership has not made appropriate arrangements.)

    The factory's Staff and Workers' Representative Conference was originally scheduled to be held twice a month, but apart from the two meetings held when the Factory Management Committee was established, no meetings have been held since. Moreover, the Factory Management Committee did not widely solicit the opinions of workers before holding meetings, nor did it notify the committee members earlier, so that the committee members could not make full preparations before the meeting; after the meeting, it failed to explain and convey the resolutions to the workers in detail.

    When the Factory Management Committee was first established, the administrative leaders mistakenly believed that the workers did not have management ability, that the workers' opinions were fragmented and unsystematic, and that the workers did not understand major issues (although this idea has gradually been overcome, there are still many undemocratic practices in some issues). For example, when the factory implemented the system of strengthening tool management, it did not deeply publicize and explain to the workers in advance so that the workers could understand its significance; instead, it simply issued a notice to each workshop and began to implement it. (Tools are returned every Saturday, and if they are not returned on time, they will be treated as lost, and the price will be deducted from wages at the end of the month). Therefore, many workers are very dissatisfied. On the other hand, although the factory announced the reward method long ago, many workers who have achieved results in their work have not been rewarded. For example, the various batteries produced by the battery department in March had a corrosion rate of 40% due to the lack of an inspection system, and the rest were mostly inferior products (the factory had prepared to sell the inferior products under a different brand name, but it was not approved), causing great losses to the people's property (estimated at more than ten million yuan at the time). However, the leadership turned a blind eye to this serious loss and failed to investigate the responsibility in a timely manner.

    The factory's trade union work is also very poor, and it has lost its role in ensuring the timely completion of production tasks. Some departments have not held group meetings for nearly half a year. The same is true for the trade union's general meeting, which has not been held for nearly five months (only one meeting was held when electing candidate representatives to participate in the electrical industry trade union). The responsible comrades of the trade union only emphasize the difficulties and do not actively think of ways to overcome the difficulties and mobilize the masses. The factory's Party work is also not done well. For example, the general branch put forward the slogan "Fight! Carry out self-criticism and mutual criticism" to all Party members in mid-July based on the specific situation in the factory at that time, but it was just a call, and it ended silently.

    Up to now, the factory's work is still stuck in this so-called "difficult" circle. It is hoped that the factory's leadership will quickly establish the idea of relying on the workers to run the enterprise well, carry out the democratic movement, promote the enthusiasm of the workers, and run the factory well.

### 公营山东电器厂  合理化建议为什么搞不起来？

　　公营山东电器厂
    合理化建议为什么搞不起来？编辑同志：
    公营山东电器厂，从四月份成立了工厂管理委员会以来，有很多严重问题一直没有解决。现在我把主要的几件事实告诉你们：
    该厂在五月份就提出号召：开展合理化建议。但因为过去该厂领导干部对工人意见一贯不够重视，而这次也只有一般号召，没有深入动员、没有检讨过去的不民主作风，所以群众在思想上仍有各种顾虑。很多工人说：“提什么意见？还不是老一套，说了不做。”个别工人还有害怕的心理，不敢提意见。六月份，该厂工厂管理委员会全体会议决定建立“合理化建议推行委员会”及推行小组；但结果仍然没有实行。七月份，领导上把开展合理化建议列为七月份的中心工作任务，但直到现在，该项工作依然没有开展，甚至仍有部分工人还不知“合理化”为何物（在这几个月的时间内，只有两件建议，但领导上没作适当处理）。
    该厂职工代表会原规定半月召开一次，但除工厂管理委员会成立时开过两次会以外，以后一直没有召开。而工厂管理委员会在召开会议前没有广泛征求工人意见，也不早些通知委员们，使委员们未能在会前作充分的准备；会后又未能把决议向工人群众做详细的解释和传达。
    该厂在工厂管理委员会初建立时，行政领导干部错误地认为工人没有管理能力，工人的意见零碎无系统，工人不了解大问题（虽然现在这种想法已逐渐克服了，但在某些问题上还有很多民主作风不够的表现）。如该厂实施加强工具管理制度时，事先没有深入向工人宣传解释，使工人了解其意义；而只是下了一道通知给各工作间，即开始施行。（每星期六交还工具，逾时不交即按丢失论，月底由工资内按价扣偿）。因此，许多工人都很不满意。另一方面，该厂虽早已公布了奖励办法，但很多工作有成绩的工人都没有得到奖励。又如该厂三月份电池部生产的各种电池，由于没有建立检查制度，腐蚀不能用者达百分之四十，其余也多是劣品（该厂曾准备将劣品换牌子出卖，但未被批准），使人民资财遭受很大损失（当时估计，约值千余万元）。而领导上对这种严重损失，竟漠然视之，不去及时追查责任。
    该厂工会工作亦做得很不好，失去了保证按期完成生产任务的作用。有些部门将近半年没开过小组会。工会全体会也是如此，已近五个月没有开会了（只在选举参加电业工会候选代表时开了一次会）。工会负责同志，只是强调有困难，不去积极想办法克服困难，发动群众。该厂党的工作也做得不好，譬如总支在七月中即根据当时厂内具体情况向全体党员提出了“战斗起来！开展自我批评和互相批评”的口号，但只是号召一下，结果无声无息的放了下来。
    到现在为止，该厂工作仍停留在这个所谓“困难”的圈子里。希望该厂领导上迅速树立依靠工人群众搞好企业的思想，开展民主运动，发扬工人的积极性，把工厂搞好。
