　　Qiu Ziyu of the Xin Chao Baihe Project Office
　　Careless Work Wastes Public Resources
　　Comrades Zhao Feng and others from Ji County Send a Letter of Criticism

Editor Comrades:

　　Qiu Ziyu, the deputy director of the Xin Chao Baihe Project Office, adopts a bureaucratic attitude in his work, wasting an enormous amount of public resources. The facts are as follows:

　　In early August, the Xin Chao Baihe Project Office decided to mobilize 1,100 civilian laborers from Ji County to participate in the old river closure project and another 1,500 as reserve laborers. The Ji County laborers arrived at the Jiaokangzhuang construction site in Xianghe County on August 9th and were assigned to carry earth at the North Dam Head. Because the roads for transporting earth were narrow and the workers could not move freely, they were divided into day and night shifts. Because the laborers deeply understood that blocking the old river channel was a huge project, related to the safety of the lives and property of the people of eastern Hebei, their work enthusiasm was very high, and the earth was transported very quickly. The project was officially closed on August 11th. Then, the earth was cultivated to reinforce the new embankment, and the plan was to complete the entire project on the 19th. However, on August 13th, Comrade Qiu Ziyu, the deputy director of the project office, without discussion or research at a meeting, ordered Ji County to mobilize 1,500 reserve laborers to the Jiaokangzhuang section. His reason was that the river water might increase dangerously within three days, and the number of people rushing to block the river must be increased. But according to the project situation at the time, the original laborers were fully capable of completing the task on schedule. At the same time, the roads were narrow, and the original 1,100 laborers were already unable to move freely, with 400 people having to work the night shift every day. If another 1,500 laborers were added, the people on the road would be even more crowded. This would not only waste working hours, but also greatly hinder the rapid progress of the project. Moreover, Ji County is 70 li from the Jiaokangzhuang Project Office in Xianghe County at the closest point and 180 li at the farthest. Including the time to assemble the laborers, it would take at least four days to get from Ji County to Jiaokangzhuang at the fastest. If calculated at four days, the project would be completed by the time the laborers arrived. At that time, Wang Zhongsan (Deputy Minister of the County Armed Forces Department), the cadre leading the workers in Ji County, told Comrade Qiu Ziyu about these situations and suggested that he not increase the number of laborers any further, so as to avoid wasting manpower and money. He also guaranteed that the existing laborers would be able to complete the task on time. However, Deputy Director Qiu neither made precise calculations based on the actual situation nor considered his opinion well. He adopted a subjective attitude and said very strongly to him: "This is the decision of the meeting!" He then called Ji County to urge them to send the laborers. After receiving the order, the Ji County People's Government immediately put aside important work such as flood prevention and drainage, dispatched cadres to various villages, assembled the laborers overnight, and rushed to the Jiaokangzhuang Project Office in Xianghe County under the starry night. But before the laborers had all arrived, the closure project was completed (August 19th). At that time, of the 1,500 laborers additionally dispatched from Ji County, more than one hundred only worked for two days, and four hundred worked for one day (collectively carrying 800 cubic meters of earth, earning 3,200 jin of rice in wages), and more than five hundred did not work at all; more than four hundred who were still on the road were dismissed midway. When they were dismissed, the project office issued 1,600 jin of millet (for travel expenses) to the laborers who had worked. However, the laborers traveled a total of six days back and forth, and the travel expenses alone cost 22,500 jin of millet. After deducting wages and travel allowances, there was still a deficit of 17,700 jin of rice. More than two hundred laborers had to beg for food along the way home because they had no travel expenses; some laborers became ill on the way. We hope that Comrade Qiu Ziyu will conduct a profound self-criticism in the newspaper.

　　Ji County, Wang Zhongsan, Zhao Feng, Wang Lijun

　　新潮白河工程处邱子玉
    工作马虎浪费民力
    蓟县赵峰等同志来信批评编辑同志：
    新潮白河工程处副主任邱子玉，在工作上采取官僚主义的态度，浪费极大的民力。事实经过是这样的：
    八月初，新潮白河工程处决定在蓟县动员一千一百名民工，参与旧河堵闭工程；另动员一千五百人作预备民工。蓟县民工在八月九日到达香河县焦康庄施工地点，分配在北坝头抬土。因为运土的道路狭窄，工人多走不开，便分为日夜班。由于民工们深深地体会到堵闭旧河道是一件巨大的工程，它关系着冀东老百姓的生命财产的安全。因此，他们的工作情绪都很高，土运得很快，八月十一日工程就正式合龙了。接着培土挡埝，巩固新堤，计划在十九日完成全部工程。可是到八月十三日，工程处副主任邱子玉同志，未经会议研究讨论，即命令蓟县动员一千五百个预备民工到焦康庄工段来。他的理由是三天以内河水恐有增涨的危险，必须增加抢堵人数。但按当时工程情况看来，原有民工完全有力量按期完成任务。同时，道路狭窄，原有的一千一百个民工已经走不开，每天得有四百人打夜班；如果再增加一千五百名民工，在路上人更挤得走不开了。不但要浪费工时，而且大大有碍工程的迅速进行。而且蓟县距离香河焦康庄工程处，最近的有七十里地，远的有一百八十里地，连召集民工时间在内，由蓟县赶到焦康庄，最快也得四天时间。如以四日计算，则等到民工赶到时，工程也就完了。当时蓟县带领工人的干部王仲三（县武装部副部长），曾将这些情况告诉了邱子玉同志，向他建议不要再增加民工，以免劳民伤财。他并提出保证：现有民工一定能按时完成任务。而邱副主任既不根据实际情况精密计算，又不很好地考虑他的意见，竟采取主观主义的态度，很强硬地对他说：“这是会议的决议！”随后便给蓟县打电话调催民工。蓟县人民政府接到命令后，马上放下了防汛、排水等紧要工作，派遣干部到各村，连夜召集民工，星夜赶赴香河县焦康庄工程处。但没等民工到齐，堵闭工程就全部竣工了（十九日）。当时由蓟县增调来的一千五百名民工，其中有一百多人仅作了两天活，有四百人作了一天活（共抬了八百公方土，得工资米三千二百斤），另有五百多人没有作活；还在半路上的四百多人便中途解散了。解散时，工程处发给干活的民工一千六百斤小米（路费）。但是民工们来回共走了六天，光路费就花了两万二千五百斤小米，除去工资和补助的路费，尚亏一万七千七百斤米。并有二百多名民工，因为没有路费，沿途讨饭回家的；有的民工因此病在半路上。希望邱子玉同志在报纸上进行深刻的检讨。
