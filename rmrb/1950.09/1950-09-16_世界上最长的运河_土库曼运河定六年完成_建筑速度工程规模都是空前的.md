Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th. TASS dispatch from Moscow, 13th: Professor Letunov, head of the Salty Sea-Caspian Sea Combined Survey Team of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which has been surveying the Turkmen semi-desert area for the past few years, recently told TASS reporters: Russian scientists have spent decades studying the water supply problems in western Turkmenistan and the Kara-Kum Desert, but only Soviet scientists can solve this difficult task. The construction of the Turkmen Great Canal is of a very large scale. It will start from Nukus, the capital of the Kara-Kalpak Autonomous Republic, flow through the ancient Amu Darya delta and the Kunya-Darya Plain, bypass the large dry depression of Sarygamysh Lake, and flow into the Uzboy – the old riverbed of the Amu Darya. Its length is equal to twice the length of the world's longest canal—the canal connecting Lake Erie and the Hudson River in the United States, and six and a half times longer than the Suez Canal. Its scale is also larger than the Soviet Union's White Sea-Baltic Sea Canal and the Moscow Canal. Letunov continued: The land irrigated by the Turkmen Canal will generally develop silkworm breeding, fruit tree cultivation, and grape growing. The southern end of western Turkmenistan will establish new plantations of valuable subtropical plants. The Kara-Kum Desert will henceforth flourish with lush grasses.

At a press conference on the 13th, Kalizhnyuk, the director of the Turkmen Great Canal Construction Office, talked about the gigantic project of the Turkmen Canal, saying: This canal, which is 1,100 kilometers long, must be completed within six years. During this period, a large number of hydraulic engineering projects and a web of canal tributaries will be built, and hundreds of millions of cubic meters of earth will be excavated. Both in terms of construction speed and engineering scale, this project is unprecedented in the world. Take the Suez Canal as an example: its total length is 166 kilometers, and the excavated earth was only 75 million cubic meters, but it took eleven years to build. The Panama Canal is 81 kilometers long, but it took 34 years to build.

Kalizhnyuk continued: In order to complete such a great project in such a short period of time, a large number of machines and engines with very low fuel and cooling water consumption are needed, especially diesel generators. In addition, a large number of new machines suitable for working in desert conditions are needed. Kalizhnyuk pointed out: More than 500 kilometers of the Turkmen Great Canal will flow through the old bank of the ancient Uzboy River. The old river bank is up to one kilometer wide, and many places are silted with sediment, and the riverbed also has a salt layer as thick as four to five meters, which adds difficulties to the dredging work. Therefore, before the construction of the canal begins, highways and railways must be paved on the barren desert, telephone and radio communications must be established, and powerful power transmission lines must be erected. In addition, large distillation water equipment must be set up and hundreds of kilometers of large water pipes must be laid.

Kalizhnyuk finally said: The Turkmen Great Canal will bring life to the desert. New cities and villages will appear in this area, and the cotton produced will be transported to the country's industrial centers via the shortest waterway. Cotton growers will obtain unprecedented harvests on the fertile soil that currently only lacks water.

　　世界上最长的运河
    土库曼运河定六年完成
    建筑速度工程规模都是空前的
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：最近几年来一直在勘察土库曼半沙漠地区的苏联科学院咸海里海混合勘测队队长列图诺夫教授，顷向塔斯社记者发表谈话称：俄罗斯科学家们曾以数十年的时间，来研究西土库曼与卡拉·库姆沙漠区的供水问题，但只有苏维埃的科学家才能解决了这个困难的任务。土库曼大运河的建筑工程的规模是很庞大的，它将从卡拉·卡尔巴克自治共和国的首都纽库斯起，流经古阿姆河三角洲和库尼亚——达里亚平原，绕过萨里·卡米什湖的大干洼地，而注入乌兹波伊——阿姆河旧河床。它的长度等于世界最长的运河——衔接美国伊利湖与哈得逊河的运河的两倍，比苏彝士运河要长六倍半。它的规模也较苏联的白海——波罗的海运河与莫斯科运河为大。列图诺夫继称：受土库曼运河河水灌溉的土地，将普遍发展养蚕和种植果树及葡萄。西土库曼的南端将建立起有价值的亚热带植物的新种植园。卡拉·库姆大沙漠上将从此繁生起葱绿的茂草。
    土库曼大运河建设处处长卡利日尼乌克，于十三日在招待记者会上谈述土库曼运河的巨大工程称：这条长达一千一百公里的运河，要在六年之内完成。在这个期间，将要建造大量的水力工程和密如蛛网的运河支流，并挖掘数万万立方公尺的土方。不论在建筑的速度和工程的规模上，这一工程在世界上都是空前的。以苏彝士运河为例：它的全长是一百六十六公里，开掘的土方不过七千五百万立方公尺，但却建造了十一年之久。巴拿马运河全长八十一公里，却建造了三十四年。
    卡利日尼乌克继称：为要在这样短促的时间内完成这样伟大的工程，需要大批消耗燃料和冷却用水极少的机器与发动机，尤其是需要柴油发电机。此外，还需要大量适合在沙漠条件下工作的新机械。卡利日尼乌克指出：土库曼大运河将有五百多公里流过古代乌兹波伊河的旧河岸。旧河岸宽达一公里，且有许多地方为泥沙淤塞，河底还有厚达四——五公尺的盐层，这些都为挖泥工作添加了困难。因此，必须在开始运河的建筑工程以前，在荒瘠的沙漠上铺好公路和铁路，建立电话与无线电的交通，并架设强大的输电线。此外，还要设置大的蒸溜水装备并敷设数百公里的大水管。
    卡利日尼乌克最后称：土库曼大运河将给荒漠带来了生命，这一地区将要出现新的城市和村庄，出产的棉花将由最短的水路运到国家的工业中心去，棉花种植者们将在目前只缺乏水分的肥沃土壤上获得空前的收成。
