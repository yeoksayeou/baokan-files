　　The Second Leather Factory of the Logistics and Supply Department of the North China Military Region
    Should Not Obstruct Workers from Organizing a Trade Union

To the Editors:
    We are workers at the Second Leather Factory of the Logistics and Supply Department of the North China Military Region in Zhangjiakou. In production, we are as active as our fellow workers in other factories. We are about to complete the tasks assigned to us by our superiors. However, we have been feeling uneasy about certain matters, and today we want to talk about them in our own newspaper. We have seen that other factories have established factory management committees and implemented democratic management, which is a great success. But in our factory, we are not even allowed to organize a trade union. We workers are often scolded, and our freedom of speech is also deprived.
    Since our factory started operating in March this year, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions has sent cadres to our factory several times, wanting to assist us in organizing a trade union. However, the administration has tried every possible means to obstruct this, preventing us from organizing a trade union and preventing the comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions from meeting with us. They told the comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions: "The workers in our factory are all temporary workers who are half workers and half farmers. They are unwilling to become formal workers and do not want a trade union." That is a blatant lie! When the comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions repeatedly negotiated with the administration and finally met with us, many workers were so happy that they jumped for joy. Everyone demanded that a trade union be established as soon as possible. But the administration adopted repressive measures. Gao Ao, the chief of the engineering department, openly threatened the workers, saying, "Whoever joins the trade union will lose their job (be fired)." He also said, "What good will it do you to join the trade union? You have to pay in millet every month (referring to membership dues). There are several hundred people in our factory, so we have to pay several hundred catties of millet. We can lead the workers ourselves, and we don't need the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to lead us."
    Through the efforts of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, we finally held a workers' meeting on the afternoon of July 31st, which was attended by more than one hundred workers (and Chief Gao was invited to attend). At the meeting, the comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions explained why it was necessary to organize a trade union, the role of the trade union, and the conditions for joining. With the consent of the workers, Chen Guoshun and ten others were elected as members of the trade union preparatory committee (the administration did not say anything at the time). We began to recruit members, and in less than two days, more than one hundred people filled out membership application forms.
    On August 4th, things suddenly changed. Han Tingwen, the deputy director of the trade union preparatory committee (a leather cutter in our factory and an active member in this trade union organization), was dismissed by the administration on a pretext. Factory Director Li Huaxuan often ridiculed and intimidated the members of the trade union preparatory committee. He said to Zhang Yucheng, the deputy director of the trade union preparatory committee, "Old Zhang, you have become a deputy director, an official. Are you still working?" He told another member, "You are still organizing a trade union? Han Tingwen has been fired. Don't you know that?" From then on, no one dared to mention joining the trade union again. When the comrades from the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions or the Labor Bureau came to the factory, none of us dared to approach them; when the Trade Union Law was distributed to us, no one dared to take it.
    On August 21st, news suddenly spread that "the administration has agreed to establish a trade union" and that a general meeting of all employees would be held the next day. Everyone was overjoyed and believed it to be true. But the next day, the administration changed its attitude again, saying that Factory Director Li did not agree and wanted to consider it, questioning "whether the trade union members have an understanding of the revolution." In reality, they were deliberately delaying the matter.
    There are many problems in our factory, and what is said here is only the most important one.

    Chen Guoshun, Han Tingwen, and Wang Jincai, workers of the Second Leather Factory of the Logistics and Supply Department of the North China Military Region, narrated
    Recorded by Jiang Hong, reporter of the Chahar Daily
    (This letter was originally published in the Chahar Daily on August 29th. What is published in this newspaper is only a part of the original letter. The reporter of the Chahar Daily also supplemented the report: When the comrades of the trade union work group of the Zhangjiakou Municipal Federation of Trade Unions went to the factory to assist in organizing a trade union, the administration of the factory sneered and ridiculed them, and openly said: "We are a production organ of the military department. It doesn't matter whether we have a trade union or not. Even without a trade union, we can still complete the production tasks. Of course, you are welcome to help us, but we have the ability to complete the tasks, so we don't need to trouble you." Regarding the fact that the factory dismissed and laid off workers without notifying the Zhangjiakou Municipal Labor Bureau, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Labor Bureau sent people to negotiate several times. However, because the administration of the factory emphasized that the military-industrial system was special, the workers had high mobility, and they used the excuse that the higher authorities had instructions, lacking a sincere attitude to solve the problem, so there were no results.)

    Editor's Note: Article 1 of the Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "The trade union is a mass organization voluntarily formed by the working class. All physical and mental laborers who are employed laborers and whose wages are the sole or main source of their livelihood, and employed laborers without a fixed employer, in all enterprises, institutions, and schools within the territory of China, have the right to organize trade unions." The actions of Li Huaxuan, the factory director of the Second Leather Factory of the Logistics and Supply Department of the North China Military Region in Zhangjiakou, and Gao Ao, the chief of the engineering department, in depriving workers of their right to organize trade unions are illegal. Judging from the facts stated in the letter from the workers of the factory, Li Huaxuan, Gao Ao, and others not only lack the basic idea of relying on the working class to run the enterprise well, but are also stained with Kuomintang practices. We hope that the Logistics and Supply Department of the North China Military Region will promptly investigate this matter.

### 华北军区后勤军需部第二制皮厂  不该阻挠工人组织工会

　　华北军区后勤军需部第二制皮厂
    不该阻挠工人组织工会编辑同志：
    我们是张家口华北军区后勤军需部第二制皮厂的工人。在生产上，我们也像其他工厂中的工人弟兄一样积极，最近快要完成上级交给我们的任务了。但我们心中老为一些事情不舒服，今天要在自己的报纸上说一说。我们看到其他工厂都已成立工厂管理委员会，实行了民主管理，闹的挺欢。而我们的工厂呢，连工会也不许我们组织。我们工人经常挨骂，我们说话的自由也被剥夺了。
    今年三月，我厂开工以后，市总工会曾数次派干部来我厂，想协助我们组织工会。但行政上千方百计地予以阻挠，不让我们组织工会，也不让市总工会的同志和我们见面。他们对市总工会的同志说：“我们厂里的工人都是半工半农的临时工人，他们不愿转为正式工人，也不要工会。”那真是睁着眼睛说瞎话！当市总工会的同志再三向行政上交涉，终于和我们见了面时，好多工人都喜欢得跳起来，大家纷纷要求赶快成立工会。而行政上就采用压制的手段。工务股长高鏖竟公开威吓工人说：“谁要入工会，就下谁的工（开除）。”还说：“你们要入工会有啥好处，每月得拿小米（指会费）。我们厂有好几百人，得拿出好几百斤米。我们自己能领导工人，不用市总工会来领导。”
    经过市总工会的努力，我们终于在七月三十一号下午召开了一个工人大会，到会的工人一百多个（并请高股长参加）。会上，市总工会的工作同志给大家讲清为什么要组织工会，工会的作用和入会的条件。并在工人的同意下，当场推选陈国顺等十一人为工会筹备委员（行政上当时也没说什么）。我们就开始发展会员，不到两天就有一百多人填起了入会申请书。
    到八月四日，事情突然变了，工会筹备会副主任韩廷文（我厂的裁皮工人，这次组织工会的积极分子）被行政上借故开除了。厂长李华轩还经常讽刺与吓唬工会筹备委员。他对工会筹备会副主任张玉成说：“老张，你当上副主任了，做了官了，还干活？”并给另一委员说：“你们还组织工会？韩廷文被开除了，难道你不知道？”从这以后，大家谁也不敢再提参加工会的事了。当市总工会或劳动局的同志们来工厂时，我们谁也不敢接近他们；发给我们工会法时，谁也不敢拿。
    八月二十一日忽然传出“行政上同意成立工会”的消息，并说第二天就要开全体职工大会。大家欢天喜地的信以为真。可是到第二天，行政上又变了态度，说是李厂长不同意，还要考虑考虑。“当工会委员的是否对革命有认识”。实际是故意拖延时日。
    我们厂里的问题还多，这里说的只是一件最重要的而已。
    华北军区后勤军需部第二制皮厂工人陈国顺、韩廷文、王进财口述
    察哈尔日报记者江虹记
    （这封信原载于八月二十九日察哈尔日报，本报发表的只是原信的一部分。察哈尔日报记者并补充报导：张市总工会工会工作组的同志到该厂去协助组织工会，该厂行政上竟冷嘲热讽，并且公然说：“我们是军事部门的生产机关，有没有工会都可以。没有工会，我们也一样完成生产任务。你们来帮助我们，当然欢迎，但我们有能力完成任务，无须劳驾你们。”关于该厂开除和解雇工人不通知张市劳动局的事，张市劳动局曾几次派人交涉。但因该厂行政上强调军工系统特殊，工人流动性大，动不动就借口上级有指示，缺乏诚恳解决问题的态度，所以没有结果。）
    编者按：中华人民共和国工会法第一条规定：“工会是工人阶级自愿结合的群众组织。凡在中国境内一切企业、机关和学校中以工资收入为其生活资料之全部或主要来源之体力与脑力的雇佣劳动者及无固定雇主的雇佣劳动者，均有组织工会之权。”张家口华北军区后勤军需部第二制皮厂厂长李华轩、工务股长高鏖等剥夺工人组织工会权利的行动是违法的。从该厂工人来信中所说的事实来看，李华轩、高鏖等不但缺乏依靠工人阶级搞好企业的基本思想，并且还沾染了国民党作风。我们希望华北军区后勤军需部迅速查究这件事情。
