　　A New Stage in the British Peace Movement
　　Ai Fu·Mengteqiu

　　The scene is Piccadilly Circus in central London. Several women and bemedaled veterans are distributing leaflets. These leaflets discuss the crimes of American aggression in Taiwan, protest the bestial American bombing of Korean cities, and call on the people to fight for peace. The police arrested the women and veterans, and the court fined them the next day for "insulting behavior." The judge explained: the central area of London is the area with the most American tourists, and criticism of American actions in Korea may insult them. Therefore, a fine is necessary, especially now that we want American tourists to feel happy in Britain and spend as many American dollars as possible.

　　On the other hand, Mosley and his fascists are parading in the bombed-out wasteland of East London, frantically shouting fascist slogans and howling that Hitler's death camps were not bad because they eliminated too many human beings, but because they eliminated too few. When angry workers rushed into these rogue groups to stop them from continuing to howl, a large number of policemen, politely assigned to Mosley by Chuter Ede, the Labour Party Home Secretary, arrested the workers. The judge fined them and lectured them, saying that they should not be instigated, and if they did not like the speeches of Mosley and his supporters, they should just walk away.

　　This is the so-called "equality of all British citizens before the law," an equality that those who seek to rise to power and make a fortune—the Labour Cabinet ministers—so proudly trumpet whenever they have the opportunity.

　　Here is another example of the "British way of life," which people generally like to talk about. In late May, the Executive Bureau meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress was held in London. The meeting discussed the progress of the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign. At a press conference convened by the Executive Bureau, it was announced that 100 million signatures had been collected at that time. This seemed to be a very important fact. A total of forty-two representatives from British newspapers and news agencies attended the Executive Bureau meeting and press conference. The only mention of this issue in the British newspapers (excluding the *Daily Worker*) was a short comment in *The Times* (although the newspaper did not mention the 100 million signatures).

　　In addition to the Executive Bureau meeting, a conference was also held in London. At the conference, speakers emphasized that hundreds of thousands of people in Britain had signed the peace declaration, and that about one thousand pounds had been received as donations for the international peace fund. Representatives from other countries also spoke at the conference. Even "experts" from the police department admitted that more than 20,000 people attended the conference. However, the four largest British newspapers (*The Times*, *The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post*, *News Chronicle*, and *Illustrated London News*) did not mention the conference at all. Some newspapers mentioned this "peace conference attended by two or three thousand people" (one newspaper even said "several hundred people"). No newspaper ever published the speeches of the representatives from the Soviet Union, China, and the World Federation of Trade Unions at the conference. This is the so-called "freedom of the press."

　　I mention this in order to point out the difficult conditions under which the British peace movement must operate. Nevertheless, peace advocates are winning great victories. The fighters for peace are collecting more and more signatures against the atomic bomb.

　　These victories have come from a difficult struggle that initially faced resistance and silence, and now faces slander and calumny. Capitalist newspapers and radio stations spread nonsense about slandering the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies every day, promoting the Soviet Union's "aggressive intentions" and the inevitability of a new war.

　　These news instruments completely exclude any objective opinion. Not long ago, when a delegation of ordinary British workers returned from the Soviet Union, the "workers'" newspaper *Daily Herald* tried its best to ignore the observers' accounts in the commentary column. However, at precisely this time, the newspaper began to publish a series of foul-smelling, American-sourced articles defaming the Soviet Union.

　　The *Daily Worker*, with a circulation of 100,000, is not officially banned. Newsstands do not refuse to sell the newspaper, and there is no law prohibiting its sale. Because Britain has "freedom of the press." These newsstands sell the *Daily Worker*, but the number of copies sold is very small. They do not refuse to sell the newspaper, but they often make it difficult to buy. They do not put the newspaper in a prominent position, and of course, they do not promote it. When people ask for the *Daily Worker*, they usually get the reply: "Sorry, sold out."

　　Other publications discussing the issue of peace advocacy are in the exact same situation. As a result, many people in Britain still do not know the struggle against war and its true significance. They sometimes do not even realize that many facts are being concealed and blocked. The dissemination of correct news reports now relies almost entirely on the self-sacrificing actions of workers and staff, who pass leaflets and pamphlets from hand to hand in their factories and institutions.

　　The Stockholm Appeal signature campaign in Britain is also being conducted in this way. No matter how good the slanderous propaganda is at spreading, the masses of the people still have their own goals: they want peace. Our task is to approach them, understand each other, overcome the emotions caused by the war provokers, and eliminate the idea that war is inevitable, that ordinary people have no power, and that they can only sit and wait for the inevitable conflict.

　　The British Peace Committee began to work with very little funding, but its activities quickly received a strong national response. The British peace movement took the form of presenting petitions to Parliament demanding support for the Stockholm Appeal. Each petition had fifteen signatures. A total of 750,000 such petitions were presented. The number of signatures on the signature books that have been returned to the committee is approaching one million. Nearly 500,000 leaflets and explanatory pamphlets have also been sold. Children organize signatures in schools. Signature stations are set up in factories, markets, subway stations, stadiums, on holidays, in doctors' waiting rooms and churches, and even near American bomber bases. In mining villages, people go door-to-door to promote signatures, not missing a single household. Demonstrators distribute leaflets, just as they did when northern England welcomed Montgomery, or when Acheson visited London. At that time, British mothers held up signs to greet him: "Our sons—not for export." Even recently, when the House of Commons was debating the Korean issue, demonstrators distributed leaflets.

　　In mid-June, the whole of Britain held a "Peace Week," which indicated that the peace movement had strengthened, and a national conference in support of the Stockholm Appeal was also held.

　　The war provokers saw the progress of the peace warriors and changed their attitude of resistance and complete erasure of facts to one of attacking at all costs. This is characterized by the speeches of Morgan Phillips, Secretary of the British Labour Party, and Vincent Tewson, Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, who first launched this attack on peace advocates. They declared that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, like the British Peace Committee, was composed of "Russian spokesmen" and "Communists who aim to harm the Labour Party and promote reactionary forces." But they dared not mention the existing application for the prohibition of atomic bombs. Their attitude was the same as that of Priestley. In response to Ehrenburg's open letter and the letters from James Aldridge and myself—in which we proposed that he participate in the struggle for peace—he hurled all kinds of slanders and abuses at the Soviet Union, while timidly avoiding directly answering the question of whether he would sign the Stockholm Appeal.

　　The attacks of the Labour politicians cannot stop our struggle. The opponents' argument is: no one should fight for peace, simply because the Communist Party's fight for peace cannot be trusted by tens of millions of simple people, who continue to respond to the call of peace advocates in real life. Therefore, the proper step taken by the Labour Party is to formally prohibit it. The Labour Party announced in its newspaper, the *Daily Herald*, that Labour Party members were prohibited from having any relationship with the call for peace. Several local leaders and ordinary Labour Party members have been expelled from the party for participating in the peace movement. Among those expelled, the members of the Labour Party organization in Bromley stand out, because they had dinner with the editor of *Literaturnaya Gazeta*, who came to London as a member of the delegation of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, which was sent here to convey the five resolutions passed by the Standing Committee in Rome to the British Parliament.

　　Those who control the news in capitalist countries, together with the Labour Party leaders, avoid any fair discussion of the content of the application and the original text of the Stockholm Appeal, calling the peace movement "a Communist conspiracy loyal to Moscow, which wants to shift the responsibility for breaking off negotiations on the prohibition of atomic bombs to the United States and the British government, although it is well known that the latter two want to ban it." Subsequently, the same groups whispered in unison (they dared not declare this openly): the competition for atomic weapons should continue, because, it is said, this is the only barrier to prevent "Soviet aggression," and the Stockholm Appeal—this is "the first important step for the Communist Party on the road to world domination."

　　But the warriors for peace are step by step exposing the masks of the war provokers.

　　The progress of British peace advocates can be determined based on the fact that the issue of banning atomic bombs has excited a wide range of people. Many scholars, two archbishops, religious conferences, and various petty-bourgeois pacifist organizations believe that it is now their responsibility to demand the prohibition of the use of atomic bombs, and they have proposed to the government to re-discuss this issue. At the meetings of trade unions, as soon as the resolution on banning atomic bombs was proposed, the leaders of the trade unions loyal to the Labour government had to put on a hypocritical posture and come up with all kinds of tricks. They rarely dared to directly oppose the banning of atomic bombs, but they used tricks to avoid talking about the Stockholm Appeal as much as possible, and instead used some words they made up to combine some anti-atomic bomb words with expressions of "loyalty" to the government and support for the government's policies as cunningly as possible in these words, violating all logic.

　　Therefore, the movement to create an atmosphere of social unrest with the issue of atomic bombs—which has so far kept its terrible secrets—has now entered a new stage. The British people are beginning to correctly evaluate all events, and the current task is to thoroughly explain this issue to people and convince them of the following: despite all the conspiracies, slanders, and malicious propaganda of the war provokers, the prohibition of the use of atomic bombs can be won.

　　Of course, the solution to this problem under the current conditions has attracted great attention. The British people, like the people of other countries, oppose war, hate aggression, and are disappointed with the United Nations, which is seen as an instrument for maintaining peace. Therefore, due to the Korean incident, the British Labour government had to declare in defense of its support for American intervention that its support for the United States was decided in order to "react to aggression" and maintain the UN Charter. This is exactly the same as what Hitler did. When he dissolved all workers' organizations and tried to throw thousands upon thousands of Communists and Socialists into concentration camps, he declared that he was doing so for "socialism!" Nevertheless, the power of the huge propaganda apparatus, newspapers, radio, and films used by the Labour government and millionaires to spread these kinds of lies should not be underestimated. To them, spreading lies and rumors is easier than trying to explain why ignoring the application for banning atomic bombs is the best way to achieve the banning of atomic bombs.

　　Only two members of the House of Commons, two veterans—the socialist Davies and Hughes (the latter elected by a constituency in Ireland), dared to cast their votes in Parliament against Attlee's statement on supporting American intervention in Korea. The task of exposing the Attlee government's "peaceful" malicious propaganda, which is facing British peace warriors, is particularly difficult on this important issue. The propaganda in the newspapers and on the radio, arrogant and presumptuous, is exaggerating Syngman Rhee's... "nobility, humanity and democracy."

　　British peace advocates recognize their responsibilities. They have only one weapon against tenacious enemies—the truth. They use this weapon to fight, tirelessly and with increasing courage, because they understand: behind them is an army of the great progressive forces of all mankind.

　　英国保卫和平运动的新阶段
    爱弗·孟特丘
    地点是在伦敦中心区的比卡迪尔广场。几个妇女和佩有勋章的大战退伍军人，正在散发传单。这些传单论到美国侵略台湾的罪行，抗议美国人像野兽一般对朝鲜城市的轰炸，并号召人民为争取和平而斗争。警察逮捕了那些妇女和退伍军人，法庭在第二天判决他们罚金，罪名是“侮辱行为”。法官解释道：伦敦中心区是美国游客最多的地区，批评到美国在朝鲜的行动可能侮辱了他们。因此非罚款不可，特别是现在我们希望美国游客们在英国感到愉快，并尽量花一些美金。
    另一方面，摩斯莱和他的法西斯分子们正在伦敦东部被轰炸得很荒凉的地区游行着，疯狂地喊着法西斯口号，大声叫嗥着，说希特勒的死亡营不好不是因为在那里消灭了太多的人类，而是消灭得太少。当愤怒的工人们冲进这些流氓群中，想阻止他们继续叫嗥的时候，有一大队警察，是工党党员内务大臣查打·艾汤客客气气地拨给摩斯莱的，把工人们逮捕了。法官判决他们罚金，并对他们训戒一番，说他们不应当受人教唆，如果他们不喜欢摩斯莱和他的拥护者们的演说，他们就应当自己走开。
    这便是所谓“一切英国公民在法律面前的平等”，这种平等是那些企图升官发财的人——工党内阁阁员们——不管有机会没有机会都那么骄傲地大吹大擂着的。
    这里又有另外一个“英国生活方式”的例子，也是一般人们那么喜欢谈论着的。五月底在伦敦召开了世界拥护和平大会常设委员会执行局会议。会议讨论了关于斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动的进行情况的问题。在执行局所召集的记者招待会上，曾经宣布过，当时已经有一万万人签了名。这似乎是一个非常重要的事实。当时英国报纸和通讯社共有四十二个代表列席执行局会议和记者招待会。关于这个问题出现在英国报纸上的（当然不包括《工人日报》），总共只有《泰晤士报》的一篇短评而已（虽然该报并没有提及一万万人签了名）。
    除了执行局会议以外，在伦敦也举行了大会。在大会上，演说者们着重指出了一种情况，说是在英国已经有数十万人在和平宣言上签了名，说是已经收到了约一千英镑作为国际拥护和平基金的捐款了。其他国家的代表们也在大会上发表演说。甚至警察部门的“专家们”也承认，有二万人以上参加了这个大会。但是英国四家最大的报纸（《泰晤士报》，《每日电闻与晨邮报》，《新闻纪事报》和《新闻画报》），一句话也不提及这次大会。有一些报纸提到了这个“有二、三千人参加的”拥护和平大会（有一家报纸甚至说“有几百人”参加）。没有一家报纸曾经登载过苏联、中国和世界工会联合会的代表们在大会上的演说。这就是所谓“新闻自由”。
    我说到这一点，为的是要指出，英国保卫和平运动必须在何等困难的条件下进行。虽然如此，和平拥护者们正在赢得巨大的胜利。争取和平的战士们正在征集着越来越多的反对原子弹的签名。
    这些胜利是从最初面对抵制和静默、而现在是面对造谣中伤的艰苦斗争中得来的。资本主义报纸和无线电台每天传播着关于毁谤苏联和人民民主国家的胡说，鼓吹着苏联的“侵略企图”以及新战争的不可避免性。
    这些新闻工具把任何客观意见都完全排斥了。不久以前英国普通工人的代表团从苏联回来的时候，“工人的”报纸《每日道报》在评论栏中尽力不放过观察家的叙述。然而恰恰在这时候，该报开始连续登载了一些臭味薰天的、来自美国方面的、诽谤苏联的文章。
    发行了十万份的《工人日报》，官方并不加以禁止。各处书报发行店并不拒绝代售该报，也没有禁止售卖该报的法律。因为英国是有“新闻自由”的。这些发行店推销着《工人日报》，但销售的份数很少。它们并不拒绝售卖该报，但是经常使人们很难买到。它们不肯把报纸摆在显著的位置，当然更谈不到为它宣传了。买报纸的人问起《工人日报》的时候，通常都得到一个答复：“对不起，都卖完了”。
    其他论述到拥护和平问题的出版物，也处于完全相同的情况。这样一来，在英国直到现在还有很多人完全不知道反对战争的斗争及其真正的意义。他们有时甚至没有认识到，许多事实被隐瞒住和封闭住。正确的新闻报导的传播，现在几乎是完全依靠工人和职员们的自我牺牲的行为，他们在自己的工厂和机关中把传单和小册子一手经过一手地传递着。
    在英国，斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动也是这样进行的。无论那些诽谤宣传何等善于散布，人民大众仍然有自己的目标：他们要和平。我们的任务，是去接近他们，与他们互相了解，克服他们那种被战争挑拨者们所引起的情绪，消灭关于无法防止战争、普通人没有力量、他只能坐待不可避免的冲突等等观念。
    英国保卫和平委员会开始工作了，它仅拥有很少的资金，但它的活动很快地得到了全国有力响应。英国拥护和平运动采取了如下的形式，即向国会呈递了申请书，要求支持斯德哥尔摩宣言。每一张申请书有十五人签名。这样的申请书总共呈递了七十五万张。在已经寄回到委员会的签名书上的签名数目，正在接近一百万。将近五十万份的传单和说明的小册子也已经卖出了。儿童们在学校里组织签名。在工厂、市场、地下车站、体育场中，假日的时候，在医生的应接室和教堂内，甚至靠近美国轰炸机基地，都设立了签名处。在矿工集居的小村中，发动签名的人挨户进行宣传，没有放过任何一家。示威游行的人们散发着传单，正像从前英国北部欢迎蒙哥马利，或艾契逊访问伦敦时一样，当时，英国母亲们高举着如下的标语来迎接他：“我们的儿子们——不是为了输出的”，甚至不久以前，在下议院进行着关于朝鲜问题的辩论的时候，示威者也散发了传单。
    六月中，全英国举行了“和平周”，这表示和平运动已经加强了，同时并举行了拥护斯德哥尔摩宣言的全国会议。
    战争挑拨者看到了和平战士的进步，便改变了抵制的态度和完全抹杀事实的态度，而转取不惜任何进攻的方式。说明这种特征的，就是英国工党书记摩尔根·菲利浦和职工会大会书记维逊特·梯尤逊首先发表了这种对和平拥护者进攻的演说。他们宣称，全世界拥护和平大会常设委员会，也和英国保卫和平委员会一样，是由“俄罗斯的代言人”、是由“旨在危害工党而助长反动势力的共产党”所组成的。但是他们关于现实存在着的禁用原子弹的申请书，却一点也不敢提。他们的态度和普利斯特里的态度是一样。后者在答复爱伦堡的公开信和詹姆士·奥路德利治的信及我的信中，——在这些信里我们向他提议参加和平的斗争，——他竟对着苏联加以种种的诋毁与谩骂，而对于直接提出来的要他答复斯德哥尔摩宣言愿否签名的问题，则很胆怯地避之不遑。
    工党政客们的进攻，并不能阻止我们的斗争。反对者的论据是：没有人应该为和平而斗争，只是因为共产党的为和平而斗争，乃不能取信于成千万的单纯的人民大众，这些人民都是在现实生活上继续响应和平拥护者的号召的。因此工党所采取的应有的步骤，就是加以正式的禁止。工党在其机关报《每日导报》上宣布，禁止工党分子与呼吁和平发生关系。若干地方的领导分子和普通的工党党员，为了参加拥护和平运动已被开除党籍。在这些被开除的人们之中，尤其可以指出来的是布洛姆里的工党组织里的分子，他们是因为和《文学报》的编辑吃了一次晚餐，那时《文学报》的编辑是以全世界拥护和平大会常设委员会代表团的资格来到伦敦，该代表团为了把常设委员会在罗马通过的五项决议传达给英国国会而被派遣到这里。
    控制着资本主义国家新闻的人们，和工党领袖们在一起，对于申请书和斯德哥尔摩宣言原文的内容，避免作正义的讨论，把拥护和平的运动叫做“效忠于莫斯科的共产党的阴谋，共产党想把禁用原子弹谈判决裂的责任诿卸于美国和英国政府，虽然尽人皆知正是后二者想要禁用它”。而随后，同样的一些集团异口同声地喁喁耳语说（他们对于这一点不敢公开声明）：原子武器的竞争应该继续，因为，据说，这乃是防止“苏联侵略”的唯一的栏栅，并且斯德哥尔摩宣言——这乃是“共产党在争取统治世界的道路上第一个重要的步骤。”
    但是拥护和平的战士们，却一步一步地把战争挑拨者的假面具给揭穿了。
    根据下面的事实可以断定英国和平拥护者的进步，即禁用原子弹的问题，已经激动了广泛的各界人士。许多的学者，两个大主教，宗教会议，小资产阶级的各种和平主义的组织，都认为现在自己的责任就是要求禁止使用原子弹，他们并向政府提议重新讨论这一问题。在职工会的会议上，刚一提出禁用原子弹的决议时，忠于工党政府的职工会的领袖们，便不得不摆出伪善的架子，并想出种种的诡计。他们很少敢于直接出来反对禁用原子弹，却运用机谋，极力回避斯德哥尔摩宣言不谈，而另用他们所编造的某种词句来代替，以便在这种词句中，违反任何的逻辑，尽可能更狡滑地把若干反原子弹的话和表示“忠实”于政府的情感以及和拥护政府的政策结合起来。
    因此，为了以原子弹的问题——迄今还保守其可怕性的秘密——来造成社会不安的空气这一运动，现在已经进入了一个新的阶段。英国人民开始很正确地评价一切的事件，而现在的课题，乃是彻底地对人说明这一问题，并使他们相信下列的一点：战争挑拨者尽管进行一切的阴谋，毁谤和恶意宣传，而禁止使用原子弹是可以争取到的。
    当然，在目前的条件下对这个问题的解决，已引起了重大的注意。英国人民也和其他国家的人民是一样，反对战争，憎恶侵略，并对于看做维持和平之工具的联合国组织感到失望。因此，由于朝鲜事变，英国工党政府为辩护其支援美国的干涉而不得不声明说，对美国的支援，是为了“侵略的反应”和维护联合国宪章才决定的。这也正好和希特勒的所作所为是一样。当他解散了一切的工人组织，企图把成千成万的共产党和社会主义者投到集中营时，他声说明，这样做是为了“社会主义”！虽然如此，但对于工党政府和百万富翁们为了传播这一类的谎言所利用的庞大宣传机构、报纸、广播、电影的力量，却不可评价过低。宣传谎言和造谣，在他们看来，那是比要设法解释为什么对于要求禁用原子弹的申请书置之不理、就是达到禁用原子弹最好的方法来得容易。
    只有两个众议院的议员，两个退伍老军人——社会主义者大卫斯和休斯（后者是由爱尔兰的一个选区选出的），敢于在国会中投自己的票，反对艾德礼关于支援美国干涉朝鲜的声明。摆在英国和平战士面前的揭穿艾德礼政府“和平的”恶宣传的任务，就在这一重要的问题上是特别困难的。在报章上和广播中的宣传，狂妄而骄纵，正在夸张着李承晚的……“高贵，人道和民主”。
    英国的和平拥护者们承认他们所负的责任。对顽强的敌人，他们只有一种武器——就是真理。他们掌握着这一种武器去搏斗，不知疲倦而勇气日增，因为他们明白：在他们的后边是有着全世界人类伟大的进步力量的军队的。
