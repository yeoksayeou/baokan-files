[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Military Law Department of the Beijing Military Control Commission of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently sentenced two spy cases. The ringleaders Gang Tiedong and Cao Wenjun were both sentenced to death and executed by shooting at 3:30 p.m. on September 29. Accomplices were sentenced to imprisonment according to the severity of their crimes.

The bandit spy Gang Tiedong, also known as Li Gang and Jiang Changjiang, was 33 years old and from Liaoyang, Northeast China. He successively served as a Japanese puppet military policeman and a clerk of the Inspection Section of the Henan Puppet Police Department. After the Japanese surrendered, he also served as an inspector of the Puppet Fujian Maritime Police Bureau and a lieutenant intelligence team leader of the Second Department of the Chiang bandit Northeast Headquarters. After the liberation of Beijing, he used the alias Li Gang and infiltrated the Newborn Stamp Factory of the 208th Division of the People's Liberation Army in 1950, taking the opportunity to plot the organization of an intelligence team and an action team. In May, he contacted KMT secret agent Zhang Baowen, forged passes, carried guns, and spied on military intelligence, and sent people to Guangzhou and Kowloon in an attempt to contact bandit spies.

KMT secret agent Cao Wenjun, also known as Cao Wenhu, was 31 years old and from Puxian County, Shanxi. Since 1943, he had successively served as a staff member of the "Honglu Training Committee," a special agent organization of Yan Xishan's bandit gang, and as a secretary of the Puppet Shanxi Provincial Cadre Work Committee and the Puppet Shanxi Self-Defense Force Training Committee. After the liberation of Beijing, he lurked in the city and refused to register. In April 1949, under the instigation of KMT secret agent Wang Yuru, he colluded with bandit soldiers Yang Shixian, Yang Delin, and others to organize the "North China Volunteer Army," establishing four brigades and appointing Yang and others as brigade and company commanders, with himself as commander. He actively recruited vagrants and ruffians to expand the reactionary organization, and successively attempted to defraud money with letters from the "North China Volunteer Army" and planned to print reactionary leaflets. In November 1949, Cao also convened a meeting of his close accomplices, distributing activity funds. Cao himself planned to go to Taiwan to contact bandit spies and was arrested in Tianjin.

These bandit spies have consistently engaged in counter-revolutionary activities. After liberation, they did not repent but continued to organize counter-revolutionary armed forces, spy on national military secrets, and attempt to undermine the people's democratic regime and disrupt the public security of the people's capital. Their crimes are heinous. The Military Law Department sentenced the principal offenders Gang Tiedong and Cao Wenjun to death as a demonstration of suppression. Zhang Baowen, who conspired in the spy plan and participated in organizing subversive activities, was sentenced to ten years in prison. Yang Shixian, who participated in and actively expanded the reactionary organization and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, was sentenced to twelve years in prison. Yang Delin, who participated in the reactionary organization and engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, was sentenced to four years in prison.

    昨枪决首恶匪特二名  伙谋分子分别判以徒刑
    【京市新闻处讯】中国人民解放军北京市军事管制委员会军法处，顷判决特务案两起。首恶者刚铁栋、曹文浚均处死刑，于九月二十九日下午三时半执行枪决。从犯按罪恶轻重，分别处以徒刑。
    匪特刚铁栋又名李刚、江长江、三十三岁，东北辽阳人，曾历任日伪宪兵及河南伪警务厅督察科员，日寇投降后，又任伪福建水上警察局督察及蒋匪东北行辕二处上尉情报组长等职。北京解放后，化名李刚，于五○年混入人民解放军二○八师新生印花工厂，乘机主谋组织情报组及行动队，五月间与军统特务张宝文联系，伪造路条携带枪支，刺探军情，并派人去广州、九龙，企图与匪特谋取联系。
    军统特务曹文浚，又名曹文虎，三十一岁，山西蒲县人，自一九四三年起，先后任阎锡山匪帮特务组织“洪炉训练委员会”干事，伪山西省干部工作委员会及伪山西自卫队训练委员会等秘书。北京解放后，潜伏本市，拒不登记。一九四九年四月受军统特务王玉如指使，勾结匪军散兵杨世显、杨德林等多人组织“华北义勇军”，成立四个大队，分任杨等为大队长中队长，自任司令，积极招收游民流氓扩大反动组织，并先后企图以“华北义勇军”函件诈财，拟印发反动传单。一九四九年十一月曹特又召集其亲近伙匪开会，发给活动费，曹特本人则拟定赴台湾向匪特联络，行至天津被捕。
    该匪特等一贯从事反革命活动，解放后，不知悔过，仍继续组织反革命武装，刺探国家军事机密，企图破坏人民民主政权，扰乱人民首都治安。实属罪大恶极，军法处乃对首要分子刚铁栋、曹文浚处以死刑，以示镇压。张宝文伙谋特务计划工作，参与组织阴谋破坏活动，处徒刑十年，杨世显参加并积极扩大反动组织，从事反革命活动，处徒刑十二年，杨德林参加反动组织，从事反革命活动，处徒刑四年。
