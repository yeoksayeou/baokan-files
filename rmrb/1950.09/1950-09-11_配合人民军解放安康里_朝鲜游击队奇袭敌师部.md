    Korean Guerrillas Launch a Surprise Attack on Enemy Divisional Headquarters
    [Xinhua News Agency, Eighth Dispatch] According to a report by the Associated Press: Korean guerrillas "played a significant role" in the battle to liberate Ankang-ri on the eastern front, coordinating with the Korean People's Army. On the evening of the fourth, the guerrillas attacked the divisional headquarters of the puppet "Capital Division" stationed in the area, "forcing staff officers to flee in disarray. The division commander, Colonel Song, and the American advisor, Lieutenant Colonel Barris, climbed over mountains and ridges, running eight miles to reach the new command post."
    United Press reporter McBeth reported on the 6th: "The exhausted cavalry (referring to the U.S. First Cavalry Division) today retreated two miles further into the panic-stricken Daegu, which is only seven miles from the front line..." "Chaos has already occurred in their rear."

    朝鲜游击队奇袭敌师部
    【新华社八日讯】据合众社讯：朝鲜游击队在配合人民军解放东线安康里的战斗中“起过很大作用”。游击队于四日晚袭击驻守该地的伪“首都师团”的师部，“迫使参谋部官员狼狈逃命。该师师长宋上校与美国顾问巴利斯中校爬山越岭，跑了八英里才到新指挥部”。
    美联社记者麦克贝斯六日报道：“疲惫不堪的骑兵（指美第一骑兵师）今日向离前线只有七英里的风声鹤唳的大邱后退了两英里之多”、“他们的后方已发生混乱”。
