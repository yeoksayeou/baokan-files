　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 13th: Shanxi Province's state-owned trading organizations are actively purchasing new cotton and helping cotton farmers obtain grain and general merchandise. This year, Shanxi Province planted a total of over 2.3 million mu of cotton. Except for Yuncheng Prefecture, which experienced reduced production due to drought, it is estimated that approximately 500,000 dan of ginned cotton can be produced. When new cotton was put on the market in August, the sales were brisk due to the relatively low price of wheat (before the War of Resistance Against Japan, one jin of ginned cotton could be exchanged for eight jin of wheat; in August this year, it could be exchanged for eleven jin). In order to maintain a reasonable cotton-grain price ratio, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government, while basically satisfying the cotton farmers' demands for selling cotton and buying grain, has adjusted the cotton-grain exchange ratio to nine jin of wheat per jin of ginned cotton, and encouraged private merchants to open cotton warehouses and shops. Strict measures are being taken against those who raise or lower prices and those who adulterate cotton with water or sand. The Yuncheng and Houma cotton, yarn, and cloth sub-branches provide cotton farmers with "Cotton Sales Certificates" when they sell cotton, guaranteeing that cotton farmers can buy the grain they need from state-owned grain companies. The Yuncheng Grain Branch sold 3.44 million jin of wheat from August 1st to 25th and established eight additional grain sales points in Hejin and other places. At the same time, department stores also transported industrial products worth 400 million yuan to Yuncheng and Linfen in August to supply cotton farmers. The Fenyang Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company and the Linfen, Wenshui, and other county supply and marketing cooperatives signed cotton pre-purchase contracts with local farmers for 1,000 bolts of cloth, guaranteeing nine jin of rice per jin of ginned cotton. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also allocated 150,000 jin of millet to Fenyang Prefecture to pre-purchase ginned cotton from cotton farmers. At present, the Linfen and Houma Grain Companies are recovering 50% to 60% of the currency invested by the Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company every day.
　　In order to ensure the quality of cotton purchased and reward improvements in cotton quality, the Shanxi Provincial Cotton, Yarn, and Cloth Company trained 100 cotton grading personnel this year. The grading standards have gradually become accurate and consistent, implementing the policy of superior cotton, superior price. Because the Shanxi Provincial Cotton Improvement Institute promoted Sz cotton on 68,000 mu in Jie County, Yuxiang, and Linfen, and pure Jin cotton on 35,000 mu in Fenyang and Wenshui, it has decided to establish three cotton ginning factories in Yuncheng, Linfen, and Fenyang to specially purchase superior seed cotton in order to ensure the seeds needed for the promotion of 500,000 mu of superior cotton next year.

　　山西开展购棉工作
    贯彻优棉优价政策
    【新华社太原十三日电】山西省国营贸易机关积极收购新棉，并帮助棉农获得粮食、百货。山西省今年共植棉二百三十余万亩，除运城专区因天旱减产外，估计约可产皮棉五十余万担。八月间新棉上市时，由于小麦价格较低（抗日战争前一斤皮棉可换八斤小麦，今年八月间可换十一斤），故原棉上市踊跃。山西省人民政府为保持合理的棉粮比价，在基本上满足棉农售棉购粮的要求下，已将棉粮交换比率调整为每斤皮棉换购九斤小麦，并鼓励私商开设花栈、花店，对于抬高或压低价格、掺水掺沙则严格取缔。运城、侯马花纱布分、支公司在棉农卖棉时，开给“售棉证明书”，保证棉农在国营粮食公司买到所需粮食。运城粮食分公司八月一日至二十五日即售出小麦三百四十四万余斤，并在河津等地增设售粮点八处。与此同时，百货公司亦在八月份向运城、临汾两地运去价值四亿元的工业品供给棉农。汾阳花纱布公司与临汾、文水等县供销社又以一千匹布与该地农民签订棉花预购合同，保证每斤皮棉折米九斤。省供销社也拨付汾阳专区小米十五万斤，向棉农预购皮棉。目前临汾、侯马粮食公司，每日回笼花纱布公司投出货币量的百分之五十至六十。
    为保证购棉质量及奖励提高棉质，山西省花纱布公司今年曾训练了一百名棉花分级人员，分级标准现已逐渐趋于准确、一致，贯彻了优棉优价政策。山西省棉业改进所，今年因在解县、虞乡、临汾推广斯字棉六万八千亩，汾阳、文水推广纯种金字棉三万五千余亩，因此已确定在运城、临汾、汾阳设轧花厂三处，专门收购优种籽花，以保证明年推广五十万亩优棉所需籽种。
