Xinhua News Agency, 26th. People in Northeast China and other regions launched a campaign to comfort the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary military personnel on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day.

In Heilongjiang Province, an "Support the Army and Give Preferential Treatment to Families of Servicemen" week has been held in various places since the tenth day of the eighth lunar month (September 21st in the Gregorian calendar). In addition to effectively solving some of the problems existing in the work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen, people in various parts of the province have decided to comfort all the families of martyrs, military dependents, and disabled veterans in the province, and give each person two jin of flour and one jin of meat.

Harbin also launched a citywide support-the-army campaign around the Mid-Autumn Festival.

Residents of various districts in Shenyang presented gifts and letters of sympathy to the families of martyrs and military personnel. Beishi District alone comforted them with nearly 20,000 jin of sorghum rice, enough for more than 280 families of martyrs and military personnel in the district to live on for two months. The district also held a commendation meeting for model military dependents on the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and fifteen models were awarded material and spiritual rewards.

Farmers who are in the midst of harvesting have expressed their concern for the families of martyrs and military personnel by doing a good job in harvesting on their behalf. Farmers in various places have generally formulated plans for harvesting on their behalf, giving priority to the harvesting, pulling, and threshing for families of martyrs and military personnel. All mutual aid teams or farmers who have fixed contracts for farming for families of martyrs and military personnel, under the leadership of the local people's government, fairly assess the land yield to ensure that the agricultural harvest of families of martyrs and military personnel is no less than that of ordinary farmers on the same land.

At the symposiums of families of martyrs and military personnel in various parts of Northeast China, people unanimously expressed their opposition to the current barbaric acts of the United States in expanding its war of aggression, and expressed their determination to have their children resolutely eliminate any enemies who dare to invade our territory. Li Shutian, an old man in his seventies and a military dependent in Beishi District, Shenyang, said at the symposium: "My son and grandson have joined the People's Liberation Army. I will not let them come home until the American devils are driven out of Taiwan." Many military dependents also wrote letters to their relatives at the front, encouraging them to strive to perform meritorious service for the people in the war to liberate Taiwan and Tibet.

In addition, the People's Governments of various districts in Nanjing also warmly comforted the families of martyrs and military personnel, and held separate symposiums for military dependents yesterday, expressing the government's deep concern for them. The People's Governments of various districts have been distributing fresh fish, production relief grain, moon cakes, pomegranates, and porcelain honorary plaques to military dependents since the 24th.

　　东北等地人民
    中秋节慰劳革命烈、军属
    【新华社二十六日讯】东北等地人民在中秋节和国庆日前夕掀起了慰问革命烈士家属和革命军人家属的运动。
    黑龙江省各地自旧历八月十日（即公历九月二十一日）起即举行拥军优属运动周。该省各地人民除切实解决优属工作中存在的一些问题外，并决定慰问全省烈属、军属、荣誉军人，送给每人二斤面、一斤肉。
    哈尔滨市在中秋节前后亦展开了全市性的劳军运动。
    沈阳市各区居民纷纷以礼品和慰劳信送给烈军属。仅该市北市区即慰劳了高粱米近两万斤，足够全区二百八十多户烈军属两个月生活之用。该区并于中秋节前夕举行奖励模范军属大会，有十五名模范荣获物质和精神奖励。
    正在丰收中的农民，纷纷以作好代收工作来表示对烈军属的关怀。各地农民普遍订立了代收计划，为烈军属先割、先拉、先打。凡为烈军属固定包耕的互助组或农民，都在当地人民政府领导下，公平地评定土地产量，以保证烈军属的农产物收获不少于同样土地的一般农民。
    东北各地人民在烈属、军属座谈会上，一致表示反对目前美国扩大侵略战争的野蛮行为，并纷纷表示要自己的子弟坚决消灭敢于侵犯我国领土的敌人。沈阳市北市区七十多岁的军属李树田老先生在座谈会上说：“我的儿子和孙子都参加了人民解放军，不把美国鬼子赶出台湾，我一定不让他们回家。”许多军属并纷纷给前方的亲人写信，鼓励他们争取在解放台湾、西藏的战争中为人民立功。
    此外，南京市各区人民政府也热烈地慰问烈军属，并于昨日分别召开军属座谈会，表示政府对他们的深切关怀。各区人民政府自二十四日起分别发给军属鲜鱼，生产救济粮，月饼、石榴以及瓷制的光荣牌等。
