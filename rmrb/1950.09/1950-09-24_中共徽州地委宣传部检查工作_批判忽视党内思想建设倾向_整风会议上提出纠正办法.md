　　CCP Huizhou Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department Inspects Work
    Criticizes Tendency to Neglect Ideological Construction within the Party
    Proposes Corrective Measures at Rectification Meeting
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Propaganda Department of the CCP Southern Anhui District Huizhou Prefectural Committee, concentrated on conducting a rectification campaign among the propaganda departments at the prefectural (regional) level on August 15th. At the second meeting from August 22nd to 24th, Cheng Guanghua, the head of the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department, first gave a preliminary self-criticism report on the main problems in the work of the Propaganda Department. The report pointed out: Under the correct leadership of the higher-level Party Committee and the Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department has made considerable achievements in its work and has made certain progress, but the shortcomings and errors accompanying these achievements and progress are very serious:
    First, the issue of changing the organizational form and working methods of the Party Committee Propaganda Department was one of the main issues resolved at the East China Bureau Propaganda Conference in March of this year. The Southern Anhui District Party Committee's May Propaganda Conference also made specific decisions: The main tasks of the Party Committee Propaganda Department are: to do a good job in the Party's ideological construction work, strengthen leadership over propaganda and mobilization work, and implement the Party's propaganda and cultural education policies. All work related to cultural and educational administrative affairs should be transferred to government agencies, but the Propaganda Department has not implemented this decision well. For example, in October of last year, the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department directly prepared to establish a Tunxi Cinema, and to this day, the Propaganda Department has not transferred the cinema to the government's cultural and educational departments for operation and management. Every propaganda campaign, such as anti-American imperialism, peace signature drives, and commemorative festivals, is directly arranged by the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department. At the "August 1st" Army Day commemorative meeting, even the loudspeaker equipment, the master of ceremonies, and the shouting of slogans were personally designated by the cadres of the Propaganda Department. This has hindered the full发挥 of the enthusiasm of comrades in government cultural and educational departments and mass organizations' propaganda departments. More importantly, it is being busy with affairs and neglecting the leadership of policy and guideline issues. For example, the political courses in secondary schools have only been formally studied twice and arranged for studying and evaluating the "White Paper" once in one year and two months in the department affairs meetings. In the first half of this year, the head of the Propaganda Department did not even know what the political courses were teaching.
    Second, strengthening the Party's ideological construction is the most fundamental task of the Party Committee Propaganda Department, but the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department has not grasped this basic link. For example, the issue of cadre education is only addressed on a case-by-case basis, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, and a systematic learning plan has never been made. The Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department does not understand the specific situation of the cadres in this region, so in correcting the ideological tendencies of the cadres, it does not start from conducting theoretical and policy education to improve the cadres; instead, it is opposing tendencies against tendencies, and the result is that after opposing this tendency, that tendency arises again, putting the leadership in a passive position. There is also no complete plan for rural branch education. This spring, under the repeated urging of the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee, a branch newsletter was reluctantly published, but it was discontinued after only two issues due to lack of funds and cadres, and it has not been resumed to this day.
    Third, the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department attaches great importance to the propaganda of policies and the situation, but there are also many shortcomings and errors in the leadership of these tasks. Often, it only arranges without checking, so it is not clear about the specific effects of the propaganda and what problems there are in the minds of the masses. The biggest mistake is the lack of organization and discipline in propaganda work. Before the higher authorities announced the land reform policy, the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department formulated a land reform propaganda outline, erroneously proposed "the middle doesn't move, the two ends are leveled," and did not ask for approval from the higher authorities, so it first acted and then reported to the higher authorities for approval. Fortunately, the instructions of the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee were timely, and it was quickly recovered. The Propaganda Department lacks education for the cadres participating in the propaganda work, and the phenomenon of speaking casually in the work is also very common.
    The basic reason for these errors is that the Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department has not truly understood the spirit of the East China Bureau Propaganda Conference and the Southern Anhui District Party Committee Propaganda Conference, and has not seriously implemented the decision to change the organizational form and working methods. The Propaganda Department devoted most of its energy to general propaganda and mobilization work, and relatively weakened the Party's ideological construction work. At the same time, in propaganda and mobilization work, it only paid attention to routine administrative affairs work, and neglected the leadership of policy and ideology. Secondly, it lacks a mass viewpoint and does not trust the government and other departments, thus producing serious paternalism and bureaucracy. In terms of work style, it sits in the office and rarely goes deep into the lower levels; there are many work arrangements and few inspections, and the implementation of the system is not strict enough.
    The report finally put forward specific improvement plans: First, establish a normal relationship between the Party Committee Propaganda Department and the Party groups of the Special Commissioner's Office and various organizations, and strengthen policy guidelines and ideological leadership through the Party groups. Second, the Propaganda Department itself should focus on leading the Party's ideological construction issues. Third, propaganda and mobilization work should be planned and go deep into the lower levels. Fourth, the Propaganda Department itself should strengthen its mastery of policies, establish a strict working system, overcome empiricism and guerrilla tactics, and strengthen theoretical and business learning.

### 中共徽州地委宣传部检查工作  批判忽视党内思想建设倾向  整风会议上提出纠正办法

　　中共徽州地委宣传部检查工作
    批判忽视党内思想建设倾向
    整风会议上提出纠正办法
    【本报讯】中共皖南区徽州地委宣传部，于八月十五日集中专（区）级宣传部门进行整风。在八月二十二日至二十四日第二次会议上，地委宣传部长程光华，首先就宣传部在工作中的主要问题，作了初步检讨报告。报告指出：在上级党委及地委会正确领导下，地委宣传部在工作中作出了不少成绩，并有一定的进步，但伴随这些成绩与进步而来的缺点与错误，则是很严重的：
    第一、改变党委宣传部的组织形式和工作方式问题，是今年三月间华东局宣传会议上解决的主要问题之一，皖南区党委五月宣传会议上也作了具体的决定：党委宣传部的主要任务是：作好党的思想建设工作，加强对宣传鼓动工作的领导，贯彻党的宣传和文化教育政策。凡有关文化教育行政事务的工作，应移交政府机关，但宣传部并未很好执行这一决定。比如去年十月间，地委宣传部直接筹备建立屯市电影院，而直到今天，宣传部尚未将电影院移交政府文教部门去经营管理。每次宣传运动，如反美帝、和平签名、纪念节日等都是由地委宣传部直接布置。“八一”建军节纪念会上，连扩音器的设备、司仪、呼口号等都由宣传部负责干部亲自指定宣传部的干部担任。这就阻碍了政府文教部门及群众团体宣传部门同志们的积极性的充分发挥。更重要的是忙于事务，而忽略了政策方针问题的领导，如中等学校的政治课，一年零两个月中，只在部务会议上正式研究过两次，布置过一次学习评《白皮书》。今年上半年，政治课讲些什么，宣传部长还不知道。
    第二、加强党的思想建设，这是党委宣传部最基本的任务，可是地委宣传部却未抓住这个基本环节。如干部教育问题，只是就事论事、头痛医头、脚痛医脚的办法，始终没有做出一个系统的学习计划。地委宣传部不了解本区干部的具体情况，因此在纠正干部思想倾向问题中，不是从进行理论、政策教育入手提高干部；而是就倾向反倾向，结果是反了这种倾向，又产生了那种倾向，使领导陷于被动。对农村支部教育也没有完整计划。今年春季在区党委宣传部数次督促下，勉强出版了支部小报，仅出了两期，因为经费和干部缺乏又中断了，直到今天仍未复刊。
    第三、对政策和形势的宣传，地委宣传部是很重视的，但对这些工作的领导中也存在不少缺点和错误。常常是只布置不检查，所以不清楚宣传的具体效果及群众思想上有那些问题。其中最大的错误是宣传工作上的无组织无纪律现象。地委宣传部在上级未公布土改政策前，即制订了土改宣传提纲，错误地提出“中间不动两头平”，也没有请示上级批准，就先斩后奏地布置下去了，幸而区党委宣传部指示及时，才迅速收回。宣传部对参加宣传工作的干部缺少教育，工作中随便发言的现象也很普遍。
    发生这些错误的基本原因，是地委宣传部没有真正领会华东局宣传会议与皖南区党委宣传会议精神，没有认真贯彻改变组织形式和工作方式的决定。宣传部把大部精力用之于一般的宣传鼓动工作，相对的减弱了党内的思想建设工作。同时在宣传鼓动工作中也只注意了日常行政事务工作，而忽视了政策思想的领导。其次是缺乏群众观点，不相信政府和其他部门，因而产生了严重的包办代替和事务主义。在工作作风方面，则是坐在机关很少深入下层；工作布置多，检查少，制度执行不够严格。
    报告最后提出了具体的改进方案：一、树立党委宣传部与专署党组及各团体党组的正常关系，通过党组，加强政策方针与思想领导。二、宣传部本身应着重领导党的思想建设问题。三、宣传鼓动工作，要有计划的深入到下层。四、宣传部本身要加强掌握政策，建立严格的工作制度，克服经验主义，游击作风，加强理论与业务学习。
