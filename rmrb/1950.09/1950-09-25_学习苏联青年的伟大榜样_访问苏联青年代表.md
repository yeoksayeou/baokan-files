World Federation of Democratic Youth Representatives Visit Report

　　Learning from the Great Example of Soviet Youth
    ——Visiting Soviet Youth Representatives
    Among the members of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation visiting China this time are three Soviet representatives. They are all outstanding leaders of the Soviet youth movement.
    Semi-chastny, one of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol), is a resolute and calm leader and an active participant in the world democratic youth movement. He was awarded the Order of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for his outstanding work. Before serving as Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League this year, he was Secretary of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Communist Youth League. From 1944 to 1945, he was the leader of the glorious Donbass Youth League.
    Irina, Minister of the Children and Youth Department of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol), her life is closely linked with the activities of the Youth League. She has worked her way up from branch work to the Central Committee and now leads 16 million Soviet children's teams. She was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor for her outstanding work in nurturing the next generation and promoting communist education.
    Fodoven, a lively and enthusiastic outstanding worker in the international youth movement, is now the executive editor of the Russian version of the World Federation of Democratic Youth's organ, "World Youth," a standing director of the International Student Union, and one of the heads of the Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee.
    They bring the great friendship of Soviet youth to participate in the first National Day of our country after its birth, and also bring new news of the great achievements of Soviet youth in production and construction. They not only brought the great spirit of unity of international youth, but also the great enthusiasm of Soviet youth against American imperialism's aggression against Taiwan and Northeast China. This will not only inspire the fighting will of Chinese youth and strengthen the unity between Chinese youth and world youth, especially Soviet youth, to jointly oppose the instigators of a new war, but will also enable Chinese youth to learn from the great example of Soviet youth to step up production and construction and unite international friends in an effort to further strengthen the forces of peace.
    Semi-chastny said: The result of the American aggression against Korea among Soviet youth, in a word, is: it has aroused great political enthusiasm and a high tide of labor enthusiasm. Young people all over the Soviet Union have held thousands of mass rallies and unanimously passed resolutions protesting against the aggressive acts of American imperialists. The Soviet Youth Anti-Fascist Committee sent a telegram to the United Nations, demanding that the US aggression be stopped. But Soviet youth know even better that the most effective way to stop the aggressive acts of the imperialists is to strengthen and consolidate the fortress of peace - the great Soviet Union. Almost all Soviet youth have been involved in the labor upsurge of production and construction, and it is difficult to give detailed figures. A notable example is Kvav, of the Proletarian Victory Factory, who recently put forward a new rationalization proposal, namely, to promote the study and comprehensive use of the experience of Stakhanov-style workers. The characteristic of this proposal is to study specific rationalization proposals and link them with the entire production process of the entire factory, and to apply rationalization measures in partial work to the entire work. Once this proposal was put forward, it immediately received a response from thousands of workers and engineers. Tens of thousands of young soldiers who won heroic titles in the Patriotic War have established new achievements after returning to their production posts. For example, Samsov and Gandaria, who made contributions in the Battle of Berlin, have made outstanding achievements in agricultural production, which is one of countless examples. Recently, after the Soviet Council of Ministers issued a decision to build the Kuibyshev Hydropower Station and the Stalingrad Hydropower Station, many young people requested to participate in the work every day. They not only applied to the Communist Youth League, but also to the governments of various cities and states. The enthusiasm is as high as when 200,000 young people participated in the restoration of the Donbass mining area and 300,000 young people participated in the reconstruction of Stalingrad after the war.
    Semi-chastny especially told reporters: Soviet youth love Chairman Mao and the organizers and inspirers of the victory of the Chinese people. And widely study Chairman Mao's works. He called the extensive publicity work carried out by the Soviet Youth League delegation after returning from its visit to China in May this year a work of great influence. The delegation to China held mass rallies in the capitals of the Soviet republics and major cities of the Soviet Union, with tens of thousands of people participating. The members of the delegation to China reported on the achievements of the Chinese people's labor production, and the masses held demonstrations after the meeting, enthusiastically expressing their desire to consolidate the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. The members of the delegation to China made countless reports to workers, farmers and students. Study groups were organized in various enterprises, and photo exhibitions were held in many cultural palaces and clubs. Mikhailov and Kozhedub made radio speeches. The young doctor of mathematics and physics, Melgolian, also wrote a book about his experiences in New China. Hmilek, a painter who won the Stalin Prize, held an exhibition of sketches of the life of the Chinese people. Many of his excellent works were published in the Young Communist League Truth Daily. His sketch of Chinese youth signing the peace declaration was welcomed by the majority of readers. Many articles published by the members of the delegation to China in the Soviet youth's sixty newspapers and magazines were more widely and deeply spread to all Soviet youth. The writer Gonchar's work "Letters from China" published in the Young Communist League Truth Daily was also welcomed by the majority of youth.
    Semi-chastny emphasized: Soviet youth faithfully fulfill their internationalist obligations and participate in all international youth activities without exception, in order to strengthen and consolidate friendship with democratic youth in various countries. Soviet youth also constantly exchange delegations with various people's democratic countries. Soon, the Soviet basketball team will visit China. Recently, the performances of the Czech dance troupe and Korean artists in the Soviet Union have been warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. The Soviet Union is also preparing to invite Chinese art troupes to perform in the Soviet Union.
    The Soviet representatives excitedly recounted their experiences in the Northeast. They excitedly saw the improvement of the Chinese people's political level, the production enthusiasm of the Chinese working people, and the great achievements of China's construction over the past year. In their meetings with Chinese youth, they saw even more the desire of Chinese youth to strengthen unity with world youth, and saw the determination of Chinese youth to unanimously demand peace, labor and oppose the aggressive acts of American imperialists. They saw with excitement the Chinese youth's love for Stalin, the leader of progressive mankind all over the world, and saw the Chinese youth's love for the Chinese Communist Party, and thanked the Chinese Communist Party for bringing them the days of free work and free study. All this shows that Chinese youth have increasingly become an invincible force in defending peace.
    Semi-chastny asked the reporter to convey their respect to Chinese youth when he was about to leave. Semi-chastny's history of struggle is enough to write a novel, but he is so humble and sincere. He reminds people of a Soviet proverb, that is, "The more modest a person is, the more beautiful he is." (Attached picture)

专栏：世界青联代表访问记

　　学习苏联青年的伟大榜样
    ——访问苏联青年代表
    在这次访问中国的世界民主青年联盟代表团的团员中，有三个苏联代表。他们都是苏联青年运动优秀的领袖。
    赛米恰斯尼，苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记之一，是一个坚毅沉静的领导人，世界民主青年运动的积极参加者。他曾因卓越的工作荣获列宁勋章和劳动红旗勋章。在今年担任苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会书记之前，他是乌克兰共产主义青年团中央委员会书记。在一九四四年到一九四五年则是光荣的顿巴斯青年团的领导人。
    依丽娜，苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会少年儿童部部长，她的一生是和青年团的活动紧密结合着的。她从支部工作一直到担任中央委员会的工作，现在领导着一千六百万苏联少年儿童队。她曾因培育下一代和推行共产主义教育的卓越工作，荣获劳动红旗勋章。
    佛道文，活泼热情的国际青年运动的卓越工作者，现在是世界民主青年联盟机关刊物《世界青年》俄文版的执行编辑，国际学生联合会的常务理事，同时是苏联青年反法西斯委员会的负责人之一。
    他们带着苏联青年的伟大友谊，来参加我们国家诞生后的第一个国庆日，同时也带来了苏联青年在生产建设工作中获得伟大成就的新消息。他们不仅带来了国际青年的伟大团结精神，并且带来了苏联青年反对美国帝国主义侵略台湾、东北的巨大热情。这将不仅鼓舞中国青年的战斗意志，加强中国青年与世界青年特别是苏联青年的团结，以共同反对新战争的挑拨者，并且将使中国青年学习苏联青年的伟大榜样，以加紧生产建设和团结国际友人的努力，来进一步加强保卫和平的力量。
    赛米恰斯尼说：美国侵略朝鲜在苏联青年中引起的结果，用一句话说出来便是：引起了巨大的政治热情和劳动热情的高涨。苏联各地的青年曾举行了成千次的群众大会，一致通过决议，抗议美帝国主义者的侵略行为。苏联青年反法西斯委员会致电联合国，要求制止美国的侵略。但是苏联青年更知道制止帝国主义者侵略行为的最有效的办法，便是加强巩固和平的堡垒——伟大的苏联。几乎是全体的苏联青年都卷入了生产建设的劳动热潮之中，要举出详细的数字是困难的。显著的例子如无产者胜利工厂的克瓦廖夫，在不久以前提出了一项新的合理化建议，即推广研究与综合斯塔哈诺夫式工作者的经验，并加以运用。这一建议的特色是研究具体的合理化建议，使之和整个工厂的整个生产过程联系起来，把部分工作中的合理化措施用于整个工作之中。这一建议一经提出后，立即获得了成千的工人和工程师的响应。成千成万在卫国战争中获得英雄称号的青年战士，在回到生产岗位上之后又纷纷建立了功勋。例如在柏林战役中立过功的萨姆索莫夫和干达利亚，在农业生产中又获得了卓越成就，便是无数范例中的一个。最近苏联部长会议发布了建设古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站的决定之后，每天都有众多的青年请求去参加工作。他们不仅向共产主义青年团提出请求，并且也向各市各州的政府去请求。情绪的热烈，一如战后二十万青年参加恢复顿巴斯矿区和三十万青年参加重建斯大林格勒时的情景。
    赛米恰斯尼特别告诉记者：苏联青年都热爱毛主席，热爱中国人民胜利的组织者与鼓舞者。并且广泛地学习着毛主席的著作。他把今年五月间苏联青年团代表团访问中国返国后所进行的广泛的宣传工作，称之为具有巨大影响的工作。访华代表团在苏联各加盟共和国的首都和苏联的各大城市都召开了群众大会，参加的人成千累万。访华代表团团员在会上报告了中国人民劳动生产的成就，会后群众都举行了示威游行，热烈表示了巩固中苏两国人民友谊的愿望。访华代表团员向工人、农民、学生作了无数次的报告。各企业单位中纷纷组织了研究小组，在许多文化宫与俱乐部中都举行了照片展览，米哈依洛夫、阔日杜布都作了广播演说。青年数学物理学博士梅尔戈亮还写了一本书，讲述他在新中国的见闻。曾获斯大林奖金的画家赫米利克举办了中国人民生活素描的展览会，他的许多优秀的作品都刊登在少共真理报上，他所画的中国青年在和平宣言上签名的素描，曾获得了广大读者的欢迎。访华代表团员在苏联青年的六十种报纸杂志上发表的许多文章，更广泛而深入地传播到一切苏联青年之中。作家龚察尔在少共真理报发表的作品《中国的来信》，也受到广大青年的欢迎。
    赛米恰斯尼强调说：苏联青年忠实履行国际主义的义务，无例外地参加一切国际青年的活动，以加强巩固与各国民主青年的友谊。苏联青年并且不断地和各人民民主国家交换代表团。不久以后，苏联篮球队便要来访问中国。最近捷克舞蹈团和朝鲜艺术工作者在苏联的表演，获得苏联人民热烈的欢迎。苏联也准备邀请中国的艺术团体到苏联去表演。
    苏联代表十分兴奋地叙述了他们在东北的见闻。他们兴奋地看到了中国人民政治水平的提高，看到了中国劳动人民的生产热情，看到一年来中国建设的伟大成就。在和中国青年的会晤中，他们更看到了中国青年与世界青年加强团结的愿望，看到了中国青年一致要求和平、劳动和反对美帝国主义者的侵略行为的决心。他们以兴奋的心情，看到了中国青年对全世界进步人类的领袖斯大林的热爱，看到了中国青年对中国共产党的爱戴，感谢中国共产党给他们带来了自由工作、自由学习的日子。这一切都说明了中国青年已日益成为保卫和平的不可战胜的力量。
    赛米恰斯尼在临别时让记者向中国青年转达他们的敬意。赛米恰斯尼的斗争史足够写成一本小说，但他是这样的谦虚诚恳。他使人想到一句苏联的谚语，那就是“越虚心的人，越是美丽。”（附图片）
