War and Peace
    —Reply to Mr. Zhang Jiayin

Mr. Zhang Jiayin:

    Your letter was received several days ago. The reason we did not publish it here is because it was too long, and the central question it raised was only one: "Since we want to defend peace, why do we support war? (You mean supporting the Korean people's just war.)"

    Let us answer you simply.

    The reason we want to defend peace is because world peace is being threatened. American war merchants are openly and massively massacring the Korean people, militarily invading our Taiwan, strafing our Northeastern compatriots, and everywhere exposing their immeasurable, arrogant conspiracies. In this situation, all peace-loving people must rise up in unison to defend world peace. Light a fire where the war merchants are starting one, and extinguish it there. Only in this way can we effectively stop aggression and defend peace. The Korean people are engaged in a difficult struggle against aggression. They are heroic warriors defending peace and should be encouraged and supported by people all over the world. See, is there even a trace of contradiction between defending peace and supporting the Korean people's just war?

    The reason your question arises is because you have not started from the actual situation to specifically analyze the problem, you do not understand the essence of war and peace, but are merely circling around the terms "war" and "peace," so you have found a "contradiction." War and peace are very real things: there is true peace, and there is false peace; there are aggressive, sinful wars, and there are just wars against aggression. Imperialists need false peace because under its cover, they can carry out bloodless wars of aggression, implement political, economic, and cultural aggression, and want all the people of the world to be as tame as sheep and be their slaves. This is the method of killing with soft knives, as Mr. Lu Xun said. However, when the soft knife encounters obstacles and resistance, the robbers will take out the hard knife, that is to say, he will launch an armed war of aggression, attempting to use force to flatten the resistance of those who do not want to be slaves. At this time, there are only two paths before you: either surrender to imperialism to obtain the original false peace, or defeat the imperialist aggressors to obtain true peace. The meaning of the anti-aggression war in defending peace lies here.

    American imperialism is an arrogant paper tiger. If the peace-loving people of the world can universally awaken and unite strongly, it is entirely possible to stop wars of aggression. If imperialism insists on destroying world peace and expanding wars of aggression, then eliminate it! This is the correct attitude of true peace defenders.

　　战争与和平
    ——答张家荫君张家荫君：
    来信收到好几天了。我们所以不在这里发表它，因为它太长了，而它所提的中心问题又只有一个：“我们既然要保卫和平，为什么又要声援战争？（你的意思是说声援朝鲜人民的正义战争。）”
    让我们简单地答复你。
    我们所以要保卫和平，是因为世界和平正遭受着威胁。美国战争贩子们公然大举屠杀朝鲜人民，武装侵略我们的台湾，扫射我们的东北同胞，处处暴露了他们不自量力的狂妄阴谋。在这样的局势下，一切和平爱好者必须一致奋起，保卫世界和平。战争贩子们在那里放起火来，就在那里扑灭它，只有这样才能有效地制止侵略，保卫和平。朝鲜人民正在进行艰苦的反侵略的斗争，他们是保卫和平的英勇战士，应该受到全世界人民的鼓励和声援。你看，保卫和平与声援朝鲜人民的正义战争有一丝一毫的矛盾吗？
    你的疑问之所以发生，因为你没有从实际情况出发来具体分析问题，不了解战争与和平的实质，而仅仅在“战争”与“和平”的名词上兜圈子，所以便发现“矛盾”了。战争与和平是非常实际的东西：有真和平，也有假和平；有侵略的罪恶战争，也有反侵略的正义战争。帝国主义者需要假和平，因为在它的掩护下，他可以进行不流血的侵略战争，实施政治的、经济的和文化的侵略，要全世界人民都像绵羊一样驯服地做他们的奴隶。这就是鲁迅先生所谓用软刀子杀人的方法。然而软刀子碰到阻碍和反抗时，强盗们就会拿出硬刀子来，就是说，他会发动武装的侵略战争，妄图用武力削平不愿做奴隶者的反抗。在这种时候，你的面前只有两条路：或者向帝国主义投降，以取得原来的假和平；或者打败帝国主义侵略者，以取得真和平。反侵略战争保卫和平的意义，便在这里。
    美帝国主义是一只狂妄的纸老虎，全世界爱好和平的人民如果能普遍觉悟与坚强的团结，就完全有可能制止侵略战争。如果帝国主义硬要破坏世界和平，扩大侵略战争，那末就消灭它！这才是真正和平保卫者的正确态度。
