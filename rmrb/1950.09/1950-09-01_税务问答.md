　　Tax Questions and Answers
    Q: Traveling merchants selling goods outside their locality often face tax situations in both locations. How should this be handled?
    A: Starting from July 1st of this year, according to Item A of the notice from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Executive Yuan regarding traveling merchants selling goods outside their locality: "Traveling merchants going to other places to purchase goods, holding a certificate from the local tax bureau, can pay taxes to the place of sale at the tax rate for resident merchants." Temporary business tax will no longer be levied. In this way, when collecting income tax locally, the income should be calculated and collected together.
    If temporary business tax has already been paid in the place of sale, when paying industrial and commercial tax locally in the future, if there is solid proof, in areas adopting account-based taxation, the portion of the business turnover on which temporary business tax has already been paid should be deducted. In areas adopting democratic assessment, if proof is presented before the assessment, it can also be taken into consideration.

　　税务问答
    问：座商到外埠销货，常有两地纳税情况，应如何处理？
    答：自本年七月一日起，座商赴外埠销货，根据中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会通知甲项一款规定：“座商赴外埠购货，持有本市税局证明者，可按座商税率向销地纳税。”不再课征临时商业税。这样在本地征收所得税时，应将所得一并计算征收。
    如已在销售地纳过临时商业税，将来在本地缴纳工商业税时，如有确实证明，在采取查账计税的地区，其已纳临时商业税营业额部分，应予减除。采用民主评议的地区，如在评议前提出证明，亦可予以照顾。
