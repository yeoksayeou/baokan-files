　　Tianjin Textile Worker's Newspaper
    Supporting Workers' Correct Criticism
    Suppression of Criticism Corrected

To the Editor:
    Recently, in the First Workshop of our factory (Tianjin Zhongfang Machinery Factory), an incident occurred where the Party Branch Secretary and the Union Chairman suppressed a fellow worker's criticism of the workshop's work in the newspaper. Although this matter has been resolved reasonably with the support of the newspaper, it is still necessary to publish it to draw the attention of leaders in various factories. Now I will tell you the facts of this matter:

    In late June, Tianjin Hengyuan Yarn Factory commissioned our factory to manufacture 1,500 sets of fine yarn spindles and sent two samples. The First Workshop of our factory began manufacturing them in early July according to the samples sent by Hengyuan Yarn Factory. Half a month later, worker Yang Jialu suggested to Workshop Director Wang Chuan’yu that yarn tubes should be obtained from Hengyuan Yarn Factory to test whether the spindle wheels were suitable; however, Wang Chuan’yu did not accept this at the time. It wasn't until Yang Jialu raised the suggestion for the fourth time that the administration sent someone to Hengyuan Yarn Factory to obtain yarn tubes; at the same time, they took two assembled spindles for testing. Because the samples provided by Hengyuan Yarn Factory were inaccurate, the finished products made by our factory, after testing, showed that the yarn tubes wobbled slightly. Our factory then scrapped 729 spindle wheels based on the actual situation (worth approximately two million yuan). Workshop Director Wang Chuan’yu of the First Workshop therefore made a public self-criticism, admitting four errors: (1) No samples were made and submitted to Hengyuan Yarn Factory for trial use at the beginning of manufacturing. (2) After receiving the two samples from Hengyuan Yarn Factory (the two samples from Hengyuan Yarn Factory were different, one large and one small, smaller than the spindles actually needed by the factory), the First Workshop did not check whether the two samples were the same and casually gave one to the workers to make. (3) The administration did not promptly adopt the workers' suggestion to obtain yarn tubes for testing. (4) After discovering problems with the products, the three lathes were stopped for three or four hours because it was impossible to decide at the time whether they were suitable.

    Correspondent Wang Runlai wrote a critical piece based on this situation and sent it out after Workshop Director Wang Chuan’yu had read it. After the Tianjin Daily, Tianjin Textile Worker's Newspaper, and Tianjin People's Broadcasting Station published and broadcast it, the Party Branch and Union leaders of the First Workshop actually believed that the news reported by the correspondent was incorrect. Party Branch Secretary Ji Xuekun said: "This self-criticism by the administration is internal and should not be reported externally." Union Chairman Li Yonghua said: "This is unbearable!" At that time, Ji Xuekun suggested that the administration write a reply to the newspaper's criticism, stating that Hengyuan Yarn Factory should bear the main responsibility for this error. He also asked Wang Runlai to write a certificate proving that the administration's reply was correct. Under this pressure, Wang Runlai was forced to make a "self-criticism," saying that his criticism was incomplete. The administration sent the reply and Wang Runlai's "self-criticism" to the Tianjin Daily, Textile Worker's Newspaper, and other places, asking the newspapers to correct the report.

    After reading this self-criticism, the Textile Worker's Newspaper discovered signs of concealing errors and suppressing criticism, so it requested its superiors to order our factory to thoroughly investigate. After several days of understanding the situation, Military Representative Zhang Yintang and Deputy Director Jiang Jiaxiang of our factory convened a self-criticism meeting on August 22. At the meeting, the error of suppressing criticism by Party Branch Secretary Ji Xuekun and the person in charge of the Union in the First Workshop was unanimously criticized.

    Comrade Wang Runlai said in distress when he was forced to write the "self-criticism": "I will never write critical articles again, to avoid making trouble for myself." After Ji Xuekun's error of suppressing criticism was criticized, he happily said: "This incident fully proves that no matter who is criticized, as long as it is in accordance with the facts, it will be supported. Today, the administration finally admitted that my criticism was correct. We should carry forward the spirit of criticism and self-criticism in the future to improve production efficiency and correct shortcomings in our work."

### 天津纺织工人报  支持工人正确批评  压制批评行为得到纠正

　　天津纺织工人报
    支持工人正确批评
    压制批评行为得到纠正编辑同志：
    我们工厂（天津中纺机械厂）的第一工场，最近发生了一件党支部书记、工会主任压制工友在报纸上批评本场工作的事情。这件事情虽然在报纸的支持下，已获得了合理的解决，但仍有发表的必要，以引起各工厂领导同志的注意。现在我把这件事实的经过告诉你们：
    六月下旬，天津恒源纱厂委托我厂制造细纱锭子一千五百套，并送来两个样子。我厂第一工场就根据恒源纱厂送来的样子，于七月初开始制造。半个月后，工友杨家禄向场主任王传钰建议到恒源纱厂要纱管来试验锭轮是否合用；但王传钰当时没有接受。直到杨家禄第四次提出意见，行政上才派人去恒源纱厂索取纱管；同时带去了二个装好的锭子去试验。由于恒源纱厂拿来的样子不准确，我厂做出来的成品，经试验结果，纱管有点摆动。我厂就根据实际情况报废七百二十九个锭轮（约值二百万元）。第一工场场主任王传钰因此公开作了检讨，承认了四点错误：（一）在开始制造时，没有先做样品交恒源纱厂试用。（二）接到恒源纱厂的两个样子后（恒源纱厂的两个样子不同，一大一小，比该厂实际需要的锭子要小），第一工场并没有检查两个样品是否一样，就随便拿了一个交给工友去做。（三）工友提出意见，要把纱管拿来试验，行政上没有及时采纳。（四）发现制品有问题后，因为当时无法决定究竟是否适用，三部床子停了三四小时。
    通讯员王润来根据这个情况写了一篇批评稿件，交场主任王传钰看过后，发了出去。当天津日报、天津纺织工人报、天津市人民广播电台分别刊载与广播后，第一工场党支部与工会领导同志竟认为通讯员所报道的消息不正确。党支部书记纪学昆说：“行政上这个检讨是对内的，不应向外报道。”工会主任李永华说：“这可受不了呀！”当时，纪学昆就建议行政上针对报纸上的批评写了一个答复，大意说：这个错误，恒源纱厂应负主要责任。他并叫王润来写一个证明信，证明行政的答复是正确的。王润来在这种压力下，被迫作了一个“检讨”，说他写的批评是不全面的。行政上就把答复和王润来的“检讨”分别送到天津日报、纺织工人报等处，要报社更正。
    纺织工人报看了这个检讨后，发觉其中有掩饰错误、压制批评的迹象，就呈请上级转令我厂彻查。经过了几天的了解，我厂军代表张荫棠、副厂长姜家祥在八月二十二日召开了检讨会。会上一致批评了第一工场党支书纪学昆及工会负责人压制批评的错误。
    王润来同志在被迫写“检讨”时，曾苦恼地说：“今后再也不写批评稿子了，免得自寻烦恼。”到纪学昆压制批评的错误被批评后，他才高兴地说：“这件事充分证明无论批评谁，只要合乎事实，一定会得到支持。今天行政上终于承认我的批评是正确的了。我们今后应当发扬批评与自我批评的精神，以提高生产效率、纠正工作中的缺点”。
