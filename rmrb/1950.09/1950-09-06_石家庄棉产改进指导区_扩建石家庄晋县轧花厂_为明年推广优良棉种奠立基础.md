　　Shijiazhuang Cotton Production Improvement Guidance Zone
  　Expanding the Shijiazhuang Jin County Cotton Ginning Mill
  　Laying the Foundation for Promoting Improved Cotton Varieties Next Year
    [This newspaper, Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Guidance Zone of the Hebei Province Cotton Production Improvement Office, in order to strictly implement cotton seed purity preservation work, lay the foundation for the promotion of improved varieties in 1951, and guarantee and improve the quality and yield of cotton, based on the experience of establishing a cotton ginning mill in Shijiazhuang last year in this zone: not only achieving separate harvesting, separate ginning, and separate storage of improved seeds, improving cotton seed purity, but also solving the problem of improved seed supply, it was decided that this year, in addition to expanding the scale of the Shijiazhuang Cotton Ginning Mill, a cotton ginning mill will also be added in Jin County, in order to massively control excellent cotton seeds such as Sizi 2B and 4B, achieve centralized control, management, and planned promotion.
    The Shijiazhuang Cotton Ginning Mill, under the hard work of all employees in recent months, has undergone projects such as building workshops and installing machines, including adding twenty 36-inch roller cotton gins, one cotton cleaner, one seed cleaner, and one baling machine; in order to save manpower and enhance work efficiency, two elevators have also been added; each ginning machine has also been equipped with a two-horsepower small motor to overcome the defect that the failure of the motor affected the operation of all ginning machines last year. With these new facilities, the daily ginning volume will increase from 15,000 jin of seed cotton last year to 35,000 jin to 40,000 jin. The above projects will be completed soon, and a trial run will be held in the near future. The Jin County Cotton Ginning Mill started later, and is currently carrying out the construction of factory buildings and the transportation of machines. This year, the factory will build 68 factory buildings, using a 60-horsepower diesel engine to drive 40 cotton ginning machines and seed cleaning, cotton cleaning and other machinery, and it is expected that the ginning volume can reach 30,000 jin to 35,000 jin of seed cotton per day.
    After the completion of the two cotton ginning mills in Shijiazhuang and Jin County, a reasonable cotton separate harvesting and inspection system will be strictly implemented when purchasing cotton; cotton with excellent seeds and good quality will be rewarded, the government's cotton-grain price ratio policy will be controlled, so that cotton farmers can realize that good cotton can be sold for more money, in order to stimulate and promote the promotion of improved varieties. At the same time, before processing seed cotton, it has been decided to implement sunning, picking out inferior cotton, and taking measures of separating grades, separate ginning, and separate storage, so that seeds are not mixed in the slightest, and then after screening and picking seeds, they will be loaned to the masses, in order to enhance the prestige of improved cotton varieties among the masses. In this way, not only will the quality and purity of cotton seeds in the Shijiazhuang area be improved a step further, but also the expansion of cotton field area in the Shijiazhuang area in the future will be promoted and guaranteed, and the strength of state-owned trade enterprises in the national economy will be strengthened.

　　石家庄棉产改进指导区
  　扩建石家庄晋县轧花厂
  　为明年推广优良棉种奠立基础
    【本报石家庄讯】河北省棉产改进处石家庄指导区，为了严格执行棉种保纯工作，奠定一九五一年的良种推广基础，保证并提高棉花的品质和产量，根据该区去年在石家庄设立轧花厂的经验：不但做到优良种籽的分收、分轧、分藏，提高了棉种纯度，同时还解决了良种供给问题，乃决定今年除扩充石家庄轧花厂的规模外，并在晋县增设轧花厂一处，以便大量控制斯字二Ｂ、四Ｂ等优良棉种，做到集中掌握、管理和有计划地推广。
    石家庄轧花厂，数月来在全体员工的辛劳努力下，经过了修建工房、按装机器等工程，计增装三十六英寸辊轴轧花机二十台，清花、清籽、打包机各一台；为了节省人力并增强工作效率，又添设升降机两架；每个轧车还按装了二马力的小马达一架，以克服去年曾因马达发生故障而影响全部轧车开动的缺陷。有了这些新的设施，将使每日轧花量由去年的一万五千斤籽棉增至三万五千斤至四万斤。以上各项工程，不日即可竣工，近期将举行试车。晋县轧花厂因着手较迟，现正进行修建厂房及运输机器等工作。该厂今年将修建厂房六十八间，用六十匹马力柴油机带动轧花机四十台及清籽、清花等机械，预计轧花量可达每日三万斤至三万五千斤籽棉。
    石、晋两座轧花厂建成后，在收购棉花时，将严格执行合理的棉花分收检验制度；奖励优种及质量好的棉花，掌握政府的棉粮比价政策，使棉农认识到好棉花能够多卖钱，以刺激、推动良种的推广工作。同时在籽棉加工前，决定实行摊晒，拣出劣棉，采取分别等级、分别轧花、分别储藏的办法，不使种籽稍有混杂，再经过筛选、拣籽后，才向群众贷发，以提高优良棉种在群众中的威信。这样，不仅石家庄区棉种的品质和纯度将因之而提高一步，同时将推动和保证石家庄区今后扩大棉田面积的开展，并加强国营贸易企业在国民经济中的力量。
