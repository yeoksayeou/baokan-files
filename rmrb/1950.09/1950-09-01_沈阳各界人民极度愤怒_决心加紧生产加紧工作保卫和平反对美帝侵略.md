Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 30th - People from all walks of life in Shenyang City have unanimously expressed extreme anger at the provocative and brutal actions of American aircraft invading our airspace and conducting strafing runs. Labor hero Zhao Guoyou said indignantly: Our working class will answer the atrocities of U.S. imperialism with iron fists. We will never allow U.S. imperialism to run wild in front of us. Chen Yucai, model technician and director of the assembly workshop at the Fifth Machine Factory, said: If anyone had any illusions about American imperialism in the past, the ironclad facts of today have completely exposed its robber-like face. Our technicians must further strengthen unity with the workers, intensify production, and strive to crush any provocations by U.S. imperialism and safeguard the sovereignty of the motherland. Professor Nie Hengrui of Shenyang Institute of Technology said: This barbaric and insane action of U.S. imperialism is nothing more than an attempt to intimidate the Chinese people, but we, the victorious Chinese people, are not afraid of this intimidation. We educators are determined to unite more closely with the people of the whole country, work harder under the leadership of Chairman Mao, and heighten our vigilance. Zhang Shaoxian, vice chairman of the Student Union of Shenyang Institute of Technology, said: Since the liberation of the Northeast, we have been living a very good school life. If U.S. imperialism wants to destroy this life of ours, it will be met with the unanimous resistance of all our students. Wu Shaoguo, principal of Sanjing Road Elementary School in Shenyang City, said: In the future, in my educational work, I will work even harder to make my students recognize the aggressive face of U.S. imperialism and make the children become brave little soldiers who love the motherland and defend world peace. Zheng Yukun, a military dependent, said: Two years ago, my lover was wounded and disabled by U.S. imperialist carbine fire on the battlefield for the liberation of the motherland. I will never forget this hatred. I firmly support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest against the atrocities of the U.S. imperialists and the demands made to the United Nations Security Council. Lu Guangji, chairman of the Shenyang City Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: We must carry out the peace signature campaign more deeply in the same trades to defend the motherland and defend world peace!
