　　Air Force Learning Model Qu Yizhen
　　If American imperialism invades our skies, we will annihilate them in the skies, just as we annihilated the enemy on land in the past.
　　Bai Sheng
　　Qu Yizhen, who was honorably selected as a representative of the People's Air Force to attend the National Combat Heroes Conference, was once a famous "Heroic Marksman" in the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. He was awarded four major merits in the army. In the battles to liberate the Northeast, he demonstrated a spirit of heroic and arduous combat in the freezing cold of forty degrees below zero. After the campaign, he was honorably awarded a "Hard Struggle" medal.
　　Twenty-five-year-old Qu Yizhen was born into a poor peasant family in Penglai County, Shandong Province. His father farmed during the busy season and worked at the docks during the slack season. The family's poverty forced our soldier to wander to the Northeast at the age of fourteen to work as a coolie. When he was carrying grain sacks for a grain store in Changchun, he suffered all kinds of abuse from the owner. He thought, "The strength of a farmer is inexhaustible, but he can't stand the abuse," so he left.
　　After "August 15th," he joined the militia in the countryside near Changchun. In the continuous battles with the enemy, he officially joined the Democratic Allied Army, which was active in the southern Manchuria area at that time, as a soldier in the machine gun company. In the people's army, he not only received warmth, but also gradually grew stronger in battle. In battle, he was honorably approved to join the Communist Party. In the arduous battles, Qu Yizhen was never afraid of difficulties and firmly completed all the tasks given to him by the Party.
　　When the organization decided to transfer him to study in the Air Force, he felt that it was an unparalleled glorious task. For a soldier like him with only a junior high school education, learning to master aviation technology would obviously be very difficult. At first, he felt a little distressed, but when he thought that a Communist Party member should not bow his head in the face of any difficulties, he was determined to work hard to overcome the difficulties in his studies. In order to build the people's air force, and in order to transform himself into a people's air force soldier with good skills, he seized the time and studied hard in the short few months. No difficulty made him lose confidence in learning. He finally improved his cultural level and began to be able to calculate algebra, trigonometry, and geometry, and also understood the principles of physics, radio communication, and some aviation mechanics.
　　Because he was transferred to the Air Force relatively late, he had not caught up with many theoretical courses, but he continued to work for three months, without going out to play or rest even on holidays, and finally made up for his lessons. He painstakingly took notes, and after class, he marked the important places in the notes with red and blue pencils. When he started learning algebra, he didn't understand what the teacher was talking about at all. Later, he gradually understood some, and he used different colored matches to move back and forth in order to find the values of X and Y. In this way, his grades improved rapidly. Every time he took an exam, his score was one of the best in the class.
　　He first learned to drive, and later he was transferred to study aerial gunnery. He felt very interested in this study. His shooting skills were famous when he was in the army, and now he is working harder to become an aerial gunner of the People's Air Force. In theoretical study, he humbly asked for advice from comrades who were intellectuals. Target shooting was his forte, so in this area he could help those comrades who were intellectuals to practice. Some comrades who were transferred from the army were initially unable to settle down and overcome difficulties in their studies, but after his encouragement and his example of studying, they all had confidence in studying the Air Force. In politics, he cared more about every comrade. His noble revolutionary qualities were deeply loved by all the comrades in the school. He was honorably rated as a learning model for the whole school. But he himself humbly felt that everything was not enough, and he had not yet made any military exploits in the young People's Air Force.
　　When American imperialism frantically launched its aggression against Taiwan and Korea, he was extremely angry. He was determined to study hard, master modern science and technology, stand at the forefront of defending world peace and defending the motherland, and dedicate himself to the people's motherland.

　　空军学习模范曲以祯
    如果美帝国主义要来侵犯我们的天空，就把他消灭在天空上，像过去我们将敌人消灭在陆地上一样。
    柏生
    光荣地被选为人民空军出席全国战斗英雄会议代表的曲以祯，曾经是人民解放军陆军第四野战军的著名“神勇射击手”。在陆军里面他立过四次大功。他在解放东北的战役里，零下四十度的冰雪严寒中，发挥了英勇艰苦作战的精神。战役结束后，他荣誉地获得了一枚“艰苦奋斗”的奖章。
    二十五岁的曲以祯，出生在山东蓬莱县的一个贫农家里，父亲农忙时种田，农闲时还要到码头上去做工；家庭的贫困，使我们的战士十四岁上就流浪到东北去作苦工。当他在长春一家粮店里给人扛粮袋的时候，他受尽了主人的气，他想：“庄稼人力气是使不完的，就是不能受气”，于是他走了。
    “八、一五”后，他在长春附近的乡下参加了民兵队，在与敌人不断的战斗中，他又正式参加了当时活跃在南满一带的民主联军，当机枪连的战士。在人民的队伍里，他不但得到了温暖，并且在战斗里逐渐坚强地成长起来。在战斗中他光荣地被批准参加了共产党。在艰苦的战斗里，曲以祯永远不怕困难，坚定地完成党给予他的一切任务。
    当组织上决定调他学习空军后，他感到这是一个无尚光荣的任务。像他这样一个只有高小文化程度的战士，要学习掌握航空技术，很显然地是会有许多困难的。开始时，他曾感到有些苦恼，但当他想到一个共产党员是不应该在任何困难面前低头的时候，他就下决心要努力克服在学习中的困难。为了建设人民的空军，为了把自己变成一个有良好技术的人民空军战士，他在短短的几个月中，抓紧时间，苦心地钻研着，一切困难都没有使他失去学习的信心，他终于提高了自己的文化水平，开始能算代数、三角、几何，也懂得了物理、无线电通讯和一些航空机械的原理。
    因为他调到空军的时间比较晚，许多理论课都没有赶上，但他连续在三个月中，连假日也不出去玩和休息，终于把功课慢慢给补上了。他吃力的记着笔记，下课后，他把笔记再用红蓝铅笔在重要的地方画上记号。开始学代数时，他根本不懂得教师在讲什么，后来逐渐懂得了一些，他曾用不同颜色的火柴来回搬弄，以求出Ｘ和Ｙ的值来。就这样他的成绩很快地便进步了。每次考试，他的成绩都是全班最好的同学中的一个。
    他先是学驾驶，后来又被调去学习飞行射击，他对这个学习非常感觉兴趣，他的射击技术在陆军的时候就是著名的，现在他更发奋要学成一个人民空军的飞行射击手。在理论学习上，他虚心地请教知识分子出身的同志；打靶射击是他的拿手，因此在这方面他可以帮助那些知识分子出身的同志进行练习。有些从陆军调来的同志最初不能安心克服困难进行学习，但经过他的鼓励和他的学习榜样，使他们对学习空军都有了信心。在政治上，他更关心每一个同志。他的这种高尚的革命品质，深深地得到全校同志们的敬爱。他光荣地被评为全校的学习模范。但他自己却谦虚地感到什么都还不够，在年青的人民空军队伍里，还没有立下战功。
    当美帝国主义疯狂地发动侵略台湾、朝鲜的时候，他愤恨极了，他决心努力学习，掌握近代科学技术，站在保卫世界和平捍卫祖国的最前线，把自己贡献给人民的祖国。（附图片）
