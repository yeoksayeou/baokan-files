Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The South African Federal Government recently announced the "Group Areas Act," implementing a policy of racial discrimination, stirring up disunity among the South African people, and excluding overseas Chinese and other non-white ethnic groups. Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed He Xiangning, Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government, regarding this matter, and Director He issued the following statement:

　　The so-called "Group Areas Act" announced by the South African Federal Government is an extremely reactionary piece of legislation that implements racial discrimination. The people of the South African Federation, especially non-white people, are fighting against this reactionary measure. The Chinese people support this struggle. Chairman Mao officially expressed this in his reply on September 13th to the Indian people of Durban, South Africa. This precisely demonstrates the will of our Central People's Government to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

　　According to the "Act," the South African Federal Government authorities may designate certain areas within the South African Federation as being exclusively for the residence of a particular race, that is, the areas inhabited by white people are not allowed to be inhabited by Asians and Africans, and the areas inhabited by Africans are not allowed to be inhabited by Asians. There are more than six thousand overseas Chinese residing in the South African Federation. For many years, they have been self-reliant through diligence and thrift, have always lived in harmony with the local people, and have engaged in legitimate business. If the "Group Areas Act" is implemented, it will inevitably make overseas Chinese merchants unable to operate their businesses in peace and workers unable to work in peace, and their legitimate rights and interests will be infringed upon and damaged. Our Central People's Government is very concerned about the situation of overseas Chinese in South Africa. It is hoped that the overseas Chinese in South Africa will unite as one, unite with the local people of all ethnic groups, and strive to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests.

    斥南非联邦政府实行“种族分区法案”
    望南非侨胞联合当地各族人民争取正当权益
    【新华社十九日讯】南非联邦政府最近公布“种族分区法案”，实行种族歧视政策，挑拨南非人民团结，排挤华侨和其他非白色的各民族人民。新华社记者为此特走访中央人民政府华侨事务委员会主任委员何香凝，承何主任委员发表谈话如下：
    南非联邦政府所公布的所谓：“种族分区法案”，是一种极端反动的、实行种族歧视的法案。南非联邦的人民，尤其非白色人民，正进行斗争，反对这种反动的措施。中国人民是支持这一斗争的，毛主席已于九月十三日在答复南非杜邦地方印度人民的电文中作正式的表示，这正表明我中央人民政府保护海外侨胞正当权益的意志。
    查该“法案”规定，南非联邦政府当局得指定南非联邦内某一区域仅属某一种族的人居住，亦即白种人所居住的区域，不许亚洲人与非洲人居住，而非洲人所居住的区域，亦不许亚洲人居住。我旅居南非联邦的华侨，数在六千人以上，他们多年来勤俭自持，一向与当地人民杂居，和好共处，从事正当营业。如按“种族分区法案”规定，必使侨胞商不安于市，工不安于业，使他们的正当权益横受侵犯与损害。我中央人民政府，对南非侨胞们的处境，甚为关切。希望南非侨胞们团结一致，联合当地各族人民，为维护自己的正当权益而奋斗。
