[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] To welcome the National Day on October 1st, Tiananmen Square is undergoing various renovation projects. The relocation of the ornamental columns (Huabiao) is proceeding smoothly. The western one has already been removed without any damage. After the concrete base at the new site dries, it will be re-erected. In addition, white marble railings are being built around the flagpole in the square. Viewing platforms are planned on both the east and west sides of the Jade Belt River's north bank, and on both sides of the tramway's south side and in front of the red wall, with a total capacity of 6,000 people. A concrete brick road will be built between the south side of the Jade Belt River and the original stone slab road. These projects will all be completed before October 1st. The road construction of the tree-lined avenue will be completed before September 25th. Currently, track stones are being laid in the tram tracks. Elevated traffic control towers are being constructed at intersections such as the south entrance of Dongdan, the south entrance of Wangfujing, the south entrance of Nanchizi, and the north entrance of Sifabu Street. The road surface at the south entrance of Wangfujing is severely muddy, and large amounts of stone are being filled in to level the roadbed. Ninety percent of the entire project has been completed.

　　首都迎接国庆日
    天安门前积极修整
    【京市新闻处讯】为迎接十月一日国庆节，天安门前正进行各项修整工程。迁移华表工程进行很顺利，西面的一个已经移下，华表毫未受损，待新址洋灰基干了以后，即可重新竖立起来。此外，现正在广场旗杆四周修筑汉白玉栏杆；玉带河北岸东西两边和电车道南、红墙前两边都拟修筑看台，共可容纳六千人；玉带河南和原有石板道之间将修成洋灰砖路。这些工程，都将在十月一日以前完工。林荫大道的路面修筑工程，九月二十五日以前可以完成，目前正在电车轨道中修铺轨道石，在东单、王府井南口、南池子南口和司法部街北口等路口开工修筑交通高空岗楼；王府井南口的路面因翻浆很厉害，正填大批石块垫平路基。全部工程已完成了百分之九十。
