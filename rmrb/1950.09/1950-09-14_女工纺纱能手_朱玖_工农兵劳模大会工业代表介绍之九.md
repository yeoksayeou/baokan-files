Zhu Jiu, a Skilled Female Textile Worker
Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Model Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, No. 9

Zhu Jiu is a skilled spinning worker in the fine yarn workshop of the private Shenxin Cotton Mill in Hankou. Workers throughout the four major cotton mills in the city know that she has excellent skills, is consistently active in production, is not arrogant, does not compromise, and can overcome difficulties. She is a good example for the workers in the cotton mill. During the competition, the workers at the Shenxin Cotton Mill wrote a song for her, which spread everywhere:

"Comrade Zhu Jiu is really great,
Looking after fifty wooden bobbins,
? Ya he hei ya he hei,
The first in Shenxin Cotton Mill, ya he hei!"

"Model Zhu Jiu is really great,
We young workers learn from her,
? Ya he hei ya he hei,
Break down feudal thinking, ya he hei!"

"Break down feudalism and unite,
The four major cotton mills compete,
? Ya he hei ya he hei,
See whose machine has the red flag, ya he hei!"

"The red flag is fluttering so beautifully,
Work hard and step up production;
? Ya he hei ya he hei."

This spring, because Shenxin Cotton Mill changed to spinning 20-count yarn, there was a shortage of front-end machines. At the same time, because the factory often failed to maintain even 6.5-fen fibers in cotton blending, the back-end work was always difficult. On rainy days, the machines bloomed even more, almost like emitting white smoke. Some alleys, because of the poor cotton quality, had almost half of the spindles with broken ends, and empty tubes were spinning. Roving workers were rescuing everywhere, and more than a dozen people were squeezed into one alley, but they still couldn't handle it. In the best times, each hour there would be two hundred spindles, averaging still one hundred sixty-nine breaks. Therefore, some female workers were so busy they stumbled, some were worn down to tears. Some were even afraid to go to work, forming a generally low work morale. However, at this time, Zhu Jiu's No. 30 machine had not a single empty tube, and every yarn was spun full. The front and back alleys of her machine were blooming, and the B-shift taking over her machine was also blooming, but she never bloomed, no matter when. Therefore, when Wuhan factories launched an anti-bombing, processing, and shock-increase production campaign in March, the workers unanimously requested Zhu Jiu to introduce her experience, saying: "She has a way, her machine runs the best."

How exactly did Zhu Jiu manage her No. 30 machine? At the time, she herself couldn't explain it clearly, she just said: "My method is diligence, keep the machine clean." Later, after repeated research by examiners and trainers, they discovered her set of accumulated operating methods: First, even distribution by section. When she operated, she often properly matched the roving, large yarn, and small yarn on the machine frame, so that the yarn change time for each section could be arranged comfortably. Second, familiarity with the machine's problems. After splicing the ends, she would take the time to check the ends that were prone to breakage. If there was cotton wrapped in the leather ring, she would take it off and clean it to avoid failures. Third, continuous action. When she pulled out the tube to splice the end, her eyes would be on the yarn end. Her left hand inserted the yarn tube, and her right hand pulled out another yarn tube, minimizing the splicing time. At the same time, she inserted it without too much or too little force to prevent the tube from bouncing or not being able to be pulled out the next time the yarn broke. When winding the fly waste, she also paid attention to the broken ends while winding, so as not to interrupt the action. Fourth, doing preparatory work well. Before taking over the shift, she would first go into the alley to help splice the ends, check the machine, and tidy up the yarn rack. While eating, she would also splice the ends in advance, and clean the machine before leaving. When several ends broke at the same time, she would calmly splice the place with the most blooming first, to prevent the blooming from becoming larger and affecting the left and right yarn ends. Fifth, constantly paying attention to the cleanliness of the machine, she would clean the machine whenever she had time.

After finding Zhu Jiu's good method, everyone learned from her, so soon she naturally formed an example of overcoming difficulties in the workshop. Therefore, she became a labor model of the fine yarn A-shift.

Sincerity, simplicity, humility, and never being afraid of difficulties are Zhu Jiu's excellent qualities. After becoming a labor model, she was not proud or complacent because of this. On the contrary, she was more modest and active than before. Many young female workers and members of the Communist Youth League often came to her to learn because she did a good job, and she told them everything patiently and modestly. Therefore, she united many young female workers. At that time, some older workers, because they did not understand labor models well enough, often got angry at her behind her back or to her face. Although sometimes Zhu Jiu was so angry with these jealous and sarcastic words that she could not do anything but secretly wipe her tears, when she returned to the workshop, she resolutely buried herself in her work again. When she had time, she would still help the sisters around her with their work. Zhu Jiu's mass perspective is very good. When many people asked her about her feelings about being a labor model, she always said: "I am nothing great alone, I have to rely on everyone, it is everyone's help." During this red flag competition, when she expressed her opinion, she also said: "To do a good job in production, we must rely on everyone, and we can succeed if everyone unites like a family." In the red flag competition, because she took the initiative to talk to people, study, and help others, even those who were jealous and unconvinced in the past admitted: "Zhu Jiu can indeed be a labor model." And also said: "Zhu Jiu's glory is everyone's glory."

　　女工纺纱能手——朱玖
    工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之九
    朱玖是汉口私营申新纱厂细纱间的纺纱能手，全市四大纱厂的工人兄弟姊妹都晓得她有一手好技术，生产一贯积极，不骄傲，不妥协，能克服困难。是纱厂工人中的好榜样。在竞赛中，申新纱厂的工友为她编了歌子，到处流传：
    “朱玖同志真不错呀，
    看起木棍五十个呀；
    ?呀嗬嘿呀嗬嘿，
    申新纱厂第一个么呀嗬嘿！”
　
    “模范朱玖真不错呀，
    咱们青工向她学呀；
    ?呀嗬嘿呀嗬嘿，
    封建思想要打破么呀嗬嘿！”
　
    “打破封建团结起呀，
    四大纱厂来竞赛呀；
    ?呀嗬嘿呀嗬嘿，
    看谁车上插红旗么呀嗬嘿！”
　
    “红旗飘飘真好看呀，
    努力生产加油干；
    ?呀嗬嘿呀嗬嘿，
    今年春天，申新纱厂因为改纺二十支纱，前纺机器配备缺乏，同时由于厂方在混棉方面，时常连六分半的纤维都不能保持，所以后纺的活一直不好做。在阴雨天，车子上开花更厉害，简直像冒白烟一样。有些弄堂因为棉质不好，也几乎有一半的锭子断头，空着管子在转。落纱工们到处抢救，一条弄堂里挤了十几个人还是照顾不下。最好做的时候，每小时二百锭子，平均还有一百六十九根的断头数目。因此，有的女工忙得跌脚，有的被磨得直哭。甚至有的怕上工，形成工作情绪普遍低落的现象。可是，这时候，朱玖的三十号车上，却连一个空管子也没有，每个纱都一样纺得满满的。与她共车子的前后弄堂都开花，乙班接她的车也开花，而她不论什么时候都不开花。因此，在三月份武汉各工厂展开反轰炸加工突击增产运动时，工友们一致要求朱玖介绍经验，她们说：“她有办法，她的车子开得最好。”
    朱玖到底怎样来管理她那辆三十号车的？当时她自己也说不清楚，她只是说：“我的一套手法是勤快，车子做干净。”后来经过考工、训练员多次研究，才找出她的一套多年积累的操作方法：一是分段均匀，她操作时常常把车架上的粗纱、大纱、小纱配合恰当，使每段换纱时间可以从容安排；二是熟悉车子的毛病，接头之后，她就抽空检查容易断的头，如皮圈里缠有棉花便拆下来清除，以免发生故障；三是动作联贯，她拔起管子接头时，眼睛就注意纱头。左手插下这个纱管，右手就拔起另一个纱管，尽量缩短接头时间。同时她插时不轻不重。以免管子跳动或下次断头时拔不起来。绞飞花时也一面绞一面留心断头，不使动作中断。四是做好准备工作。她在接班前，就先入弄堂帮忙把头接齐，检查机器，整理纱架，吃饭时也预先把头接齐，把车弄清洁后再走。遇到同时几处断头时，便不慌不忙的先接开花较大的地方，免得花越开越大，影响左右纱头。五是经常注意车子的清洁，她有空就把车子扫得干干净净。
    找到了朱玖这套好方法后，大家都向她学习，所以不久，她在车间里便自然形成了克服困难的榜样。并因此成了细纱甲班的劳动模范。
    诚恳、朴实、谦虚和永远不怕困难是朱玖的优良品质。她当上劳动模范后，并不因此骄傲自满。相反的比前更虚心更积极，许多青年女工和青年团员因为她的活做得好，常常跑来向她学习，她都一一虚心耐烦的告诉她们，因此她团结了许多青年女工。那时有些老年工友，因为对劳模的认识不够，常在背后或当面气她，虽然有时朱玖被这些嫉忌讽刺的话气得没有办法，偷偷的在背后拭眼泪，可是，当她一回到车间里的时候，便又坚决地埋头干活。并且有空时照常帮助前后左右的姐妹们做活。朱玖的群众观点是很好的，许多人问她当劳模的感想时，她都口口声声的说：“我一个人没有什么了不起，要依靠大家，都是大家帮助的。”这次红旗竞赛，她发表意见时也是说：“搞好生产要依靠大家，大家团结像一家人才能成功。”红旗竞赛中，由于她主动的找人谈话研究，帮助别人，所以过去嫉忌、不服气的人也都承认：“朱玖的确是可以当劳模。”并且还说：“朱玖的光荣，就是大家的光荣。”
