Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th (TASS): Today, the Truth Newspaper published an editorial entitled "For Peace!", pointing out: In just over two months, the Second World Peace Congress will convene. Hundreds of millions of peace supporters worldwide are intensifying their struggle against the imperialist warmongers and for the defense of universal peace as they prepare for the Second Congress.

　　Further expanding the peace front among the masses, raising the movement to support peace to a new and higher level, and expanding the program of various demands in the struggle for peace – these are the current tasks of hundreds of millions of peace supporters in all countries. A truly massive and universal movement like the peace movement is unprecedented in history. The lofty goal of defending peace and fighting against the danger of a new war being prepared by the American and British imperialist vultures unites all progressive forces of mankind. The unwavering struggle of peace-loving people of all countries against the warmongers demonstrates that the forces of peace and democracy are constantly growing stronger, while the isolation of the imperialist conspirators against the cause of peace is becoming increasingly apparent.

　　The editorial emphasized that the imperialist bloc seeks to find a way out of the increasingly serious contradictions of capitalism through new armed conflicts and fascism. Attacking the living standards and democratic rights of the people, tyrannical militarism, intensifying persecution of democratic forces, spreading racism and hatred of mankind, and shamelessly clamoring for the extermination of millions of people – these are the sinister realities of today's capitalist world.

　　In the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, the great achievements of peaceful and creative labor inspire the people of all countries to conduct better organized and more selfless struggles for peace and democracy. The Soviet government's decision to build the world's largest Kuibyshev and Stalingrad hydroelectric power stations has caused a worldwide sensation. These decisions clearly reflect the indomitable determination of the Soviet people to consolidate peace with their constructive labor and to advance firmly towards communism. In the people's democratic countries, millions of workers and peasants are working hard, yearning for peace. The Chinese people have broken free from the chains of oppression and enslavement and are confidently implementing democratic reforms in their own country. Hundreds of millions of people in all countries are maintaining peace. Despite the high-pressure tactics of the imperialist reactionaries, the struggle of the masses of the people in Western European countries against American enslavement is expanding and becoming more powerful. In colonial countries and dependent countries, the front of anti-imperialist struggle is expanding. The freedom-loving Korean people are bravely fighting against the American armed interventionists, and their troops are advancing steadily southward.

　　The editorial continued: The criminal activities of the American warmongers pose a growing threat to world peace. The Chinese people and all progressive mankind have expressed boundless indignation and outrage at the news of the new acts of aggression by American imperialism – the bombing of Chinese Northeast villages. Peace-loving people of all countries demand that aggression be stopped and that American troops withdraw from Korea immediately. The countless forces of peace-loving people of all countries must further unite their ranks and conduct a stronger struggle in defense of peace, in order to answer the provocations of the imperialist warmongers.

　　As peace fighters conduct the movement demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, they firmly support the reduction of armaments and the control of disarmament, and prohibit any act of aggression in any country that would cause the danger of war. Peace defenders firmly criticize the criminal activities of those enemies of mankind who are carrying out the arrogant propaganda of new wars. Churchill, Bradley, Johnson, Moore-Brabazon, Reynaud, and other leaders of the warmongers are increasingly shamelessly clamoring for war and want to use atomic bombs to exterminate millions of old, weak, women, and children. Prohibiting the propaganda of new wars, sanctioning those instigators of mass extermination of the people, and the disseminators of national hatred – these are the unanimous demands of all honest people throughout the world.

　　The editorial then pointed out: During the preparations for the Second World Peace Congress, new achievements will certainly be made in launching the peace movement among the masses. Millions of people will sign the Stockholm Appeal, thereby expressing their demand to prohibit aggression and to prohibit the propaganda of new wars.

　　The editorial concluded: No matter what high-pressure tactics and provocations the imperialists adopt, they will never be able to thwart the indomitable determination of the people of all countries to win victory in the struggle for peace. The struggle for world peace will be victorious and must be victorious, because this struggle is led by the great leader and teacher of all progressive mankind – Comrade Stalin.

　　为了和平！
    ——真理报社论摘要
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日电：今天真理报发表题为“为了和平!”的社论指出：再过两个月零几天，第二届世界拥护和平大会就要开会了，全世界亿万和平拥护者们，在筹备第二届和大时，加紧为反对帝国主义战争贩子，为保卫普遍和平而斗争。
    更进一步在群众中扩大和平阵线，把拥护和平运动提高到新的更高的水平，在为和平而斗争中扩大各项要求的纲领——这些便是各国亿万和平拥护者们现在的任务。像和平运动这样的真正大规模的普遍的运动，是历史上空前未有的。为保卫和平、为反对美国和英国帝国主义兀鹰正在准备的新战争的危险而斗争的崇高目的，把人类一切进步势力都团结起来。爱好和平的各国人民为反对战争贩子们而进行的坚忍不拔的斗争，表明了和平与民主的势力在不断壮大成长中，而反对和平事业的帝国主义阴谋家们的孤立则日益显著。
    社论强调称：帝国主义集团力求凭借新的武装冲突和法西斯化，来替日益严重的资本主义的矛盾找一条出路。对人民的生活标准和民主权利实行进攻、跋扈的军国主义、加紧迫害民主力量、传播种族主义和对人类的憎恨、无耻叫嚣灭绝千百万人民——这些便是今日资本主义世界的狞恶的现实。
    在苏联和人民民主国家中，和平的创造性劳动所产生的巨大成果，鼓舞着所有各国的人民去为和平与民主而进行组织得更好的、更加奋不顾身的斗争。
    苏联政府关于建设世界上最大的古比雪夫和斯大林格勒两处水力发电站的决定，已轰动全世界。这些决定很明显地反映出苏联人民抱着不屈不挠的决心，要用他们建设性的劳动来巩固和平，而坚定地向着共产主义前进。在人民民主国家中，千百万工人和农民，热望和平而努力工作。中国人民已摆脱掉压迫与奴役的锁链，在自己的国家中正自信地实行着民主改革。所有各国中的亿万人民都在维护着和平。尽管帝国主义反动派的高压，西欧各国人民大众为反对美国的奴役而进行的斗争，规模日益扩大、力量日益雄厚。在殖民地国家和附属国中，反帝国主义斗争的阵线日益扩展。爱好自由的朝鲜人民正英勇地对美国武装干涉者进行战斗，他们的军队正着着向南推进。
    社论继称：美国战争贩子的犯罪活动，对世界和平的威胁日益增长。中国人民和整个进步人类，听到了关于美帝国主义的新侵略行动——轰炸中国东北乡村——的消息时，都表示无限愤慨和震怒。爱好和平的各国人民要求制止侵略，要求美军立刻退出朝鲜。爱好和平的各国人民无数力量，更进一步地团结自己的队伍，并在保卫和平中进行更坚强的斗争，借以回答帝国主义战争贩子的挑衅。
    和平斗士们进行着要求禁止原子武器的运动时，坚决地赞成裁减军备和管制裁减军备的工作，禁止任何一个国家中会引起战争危险的任何侵略行动。和平保卫者们坚决地抨击那些正进行着新战争的狂妄宣传的人类死敌的罪恶活动。邱吉尔、布莱得雷、詹逊、摩尔——布拉巴松、雷诺，以及战争贩子的其他头目们，日益无耻地叫嚣战争，要用原子弹来灭绝千百万老弱妇孺。禁止宣传新战争、制裁大举灭绝人民的那些教唆者，以及民族仇恨的传播者——这些便是全世界一切诚实人民的一致要求。
    社论继而指出：在筹备第二届世界拥护和平大会期间，在群众中间展开和平运动方面，必将获得新的成就。将有千百万人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，从而表示他们要求禁止侵略，要求禁止宣传新战争。
    社论结语称：不管帝国主义者采用什么高压和挑衅手段，他们决不能顿挫各国人民要在和平的斗争中赢得胜利的不屈不挠的决心。为全世界和平而进行的斗争，将获胜利而且必定胜利，因为这种斗争是由整个进步人类的伟大领袖和导师——斯大林同志领导的。
