    "In France, American imperialism and the reactionary French government are trying to force French youth down two paths: one is to join the ranks of the unemployed, without clothes, food, or shelter, and the other is to participate in the criminal war of aggression against Vietnam. But French youth have rejected them all and chosen another path: the path of struggle!" During my interview with Kiper, the French representative of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation visiting China, he introduced the great contributions of French youth in the movement to fight for peace and oppose aggressive war.

    The French movement to defend world peace is broad and enthusiastic. In Europe, the French people were the first to launch a broad mass peace movement. The "Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom" united the vast majority of French peace supporters. The first World Congress of Defenders of Peace, held in Paris last April, greatly promoted the French peace movement and greatly strengthened the French people's determination to defend world peace.

    Recently, the peace movement has made significant progress in France. The French people have enthusiastically responded to the peace signature campaign. A month and a half ago, when Kiper left France, the number of peace signatures in France had reached twelve million. The French population is not large, and this figure shows the great achievement of the French peace movement. Among these twelve million signatures, two million are from young people.

    French youth are an important force in the French peace movement. In the peace movement, many peace fighters have emerged, and they have become good examples for the people's struggle for peace. Twenty-year-old French girl Raymonde Dien, in the Bordeaux area, risked her life to lie on the railway track to prevent a train carrying tanks from passing. This moving story has spread all over the world. However, precisely because of this, the French reactionary government's military tribunal sentenced her to one year in prison. Another peace hero is Navy soldier Henri Martin, who was imprisoned for refusing to go to Vietnam to participate in the criminal war of aggression. The French people are now trying to rescue him. Henri Martin's heroic actions have not only educated other young people in the French army, but also played a model role in the peace movement.

    The French people and French youth resolutely oppose war and support the Soviet Union's peace policy. They put forward a solemn slogan: "Never participate in a war of aggression against the Soviet Union!"

    The important and sacred task of French youth in the struggle for peace is to oppose the French government's criminal war of aggression against Vietnam. In the streets of Paris, one can often see thousands and hundreds of masses and students marching and demonstrating, shouting slogans: "No aggression against Vietnam!" In various parts of France, large and small, the most basic youth organizations have their own flags, and on these various flags are written common words: "No aggression against Vietnam!" They insert these flags at the entrance of the city or district government, on the locomotives, in the factories, on the ships, and in all places where there are signs of war.

    Not long ago, Figuères, the Secretary of the Republican Youth Union of France, visited New China and Vietnam. After he returned to his country, he caused a warm response among the French people. Figuères held press conferences, lectures, and discussions in various places, attended mass rallies in various places, and wrote articles in L'Humanité and other democratic newspapers to report on the struggles of the people of New China and Vietnam, so that the French people clearly recognized that they should oppose the reactionary government's war of aggression against Vietnam. Precisely because Figuères visited Vietnam and had a wide impact on the French people after returning to his country, the French reactionary government ordered his arrest not long ago.

    The French youth organization that stands at the forefront of the struggle is the Republican Youth Union of France, whose predecessor was the Communist Youth League of France and the Socialist Party Youth League. It currently has 250,000 members.

    The Republican Youth Union's brother organizations include the French Young Women's Alliance and the Young Pioneers. The Young Women's Alliance has 50,000 members, and the Young Pioneers have 40,000 members. These three organizations, with 300,000 to 350,000 members, unite the vast majority of French youth and actively strive for peace and oppose aggressive war.

    Finally, Kiper talked about his impressions of visiting New China. He said that he was greatly encouraged by the great victories of the Chinese people and the struggle they have actively made for world peace. He hopes that French youth will learn more from Chinese youth. (Attached picture)

### 法国青年为和平而斗争  访问法国代表基培尔

专栏：世界青联代表访问记

    法国青年为和平而斗争
    访问法国代表基培尔
    “在法国，美帝国主义和法国反动政府正想迫使法国青年走两条路：一条是参加无衣无食无宿的失业者的队伍，一条路是参加侵略越南的罪恶战争；但是法国青年统统拒绝了他们，而选择另一条道路：斗争的道路！”我在访问这次来中国访问的世界青联代表团法国代表基培尔时，他介绍了法国青年在争取和平、反对侵略战争运动中的伟大贡献。
    法国的保卫世界和平运动是广泛而热烈的。在欧洲，法国人民首先发动了广泛的群众性的和平运动，“争取和平与自由战士协会”团结了法国广大的和平拥护者。去年四月，在巴黎举行的第一届世界保卫和平大会，对法国和平运动，起了巨大的推动作用，大大加强了法国人民对保卫世界和平的决心。
    最近，和平运动在法国有着显著的进展。法国人民热烈地响应和平签名运动。一个半月前，当基培尔离开法国时，法国的和平签名人数已达到了一千二百万。法国人口不多，这个数字已显示了法国和平运动的伟大成就。在这一千二百万人的签名中间，有二百万是青年的签名。
    法国青年在法国和平运动中是一支重要的力量。在和平运动中，出现了不少的和平斗士，他们成为人民争取和平斗争的好榜样。二十岁的法国姑娘雷梦达·第安，在波尔多地方，冒着生命的危险，卧在铁道上，阻止一列装运坦克的火车通过。这个动人的故事已传遍了全世界。然而，正因为这样，法国反动政府的军事法庭判处她一年的徒刑。另外一位和平英雄是海军士兵亨利·马尔丹，他因为拒绝去越南参加罪恶的侵略战争而被监禁，现在法国人民正在设法营救。亨利·马尔丹的英勇行为，不仅教育了法国军队中的其他青年，而且在和平运动中起了模范作用。
    法国人民和法国青年，坚决反对战争，拥护苏联的和平政策。他们提出一个严正的口号：“永远不参加侵略苏联的战争！”
    法国青年在争取和平斗争中的重要的神圣的任务，是反对法国政府进行侵略越南的罪恶战争。在巴黎街头常常可以看到成千成百的群众、学生游行示威，高呼口号：“不准侵略越南！”在法国各地，大大小小的最基层的青年组织，都有自己的旗子，在这些各色各样的旗子上都写着共同的字样：“不准侵略越南！”他们把这些旗子插在市或区政府的门首，插在火车头上，插在工厂里，插在轮船上，插在一切有战争迹象的地方。
    不久以前法国共和青年联盟书记斐盖尔曾访问过新中国和越南，他回国以后，在法国人民中引起了热烈的反应。斐盖尔在各地举行了记者招待会、演讲会、讨论会，出席各地群众大会，在人道报和其他民主报刊写文章，报道新中国和越南人民斗争的情况，使法国人民明确地认识了应该反对反动政府进行侵略越南的战争。正因为斐盖尔访问了越南，并在回国以后在法国人民间起了广泛的影响，法国反动政府在不久以前下令逮捕了他。
    站在斗争的最前线的法国青年组织，就是法国共和青年联盟，他的前身是法国共产主义青年团和社会党青年团。现有盟员二十五万人。
    共和青年联盟的兄弟组织还有法国青年妇女联盟和少年先锋队。青年妇女联盟盟员有五万人，少先队队员有四万人。这三个组织的三十至三十五万人，团结了法国广大的青年，积极争取和平、反对侵略战争。
    最后基培尔谈到了访问新中国的感想。他说：他从中国人民的伟大胜利和积极为世界和平所做的斗争得到了很大的鼓励，他希望法国青年多多向中国青年学习。（附图片）
