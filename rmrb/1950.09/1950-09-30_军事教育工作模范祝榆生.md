Comrade Zhu Yusheng is an outstanding military education worker who values the combination of education and actual combat. He gloriously lost his right arm for the sake of revolutionary military education.

For twelve years, Comrade Zhu Yusheng has been engaged in military education, cultivating thousands upon thousands of young military cadres who went to the front lines during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation. He painstakingly researched and improved various siege techniques and tactics, playing a significant role in battles where troops broke through the enemy's solid fortifications. For twelve years, he continuously participated in battles on the ground, creating and improving more than twenty types of weapons and combat equipment in his research that combined theory with practice. He gloriously lost his right arm for the sake of revolutionary military education. He is now the Director of the Second Division of the Training Department of the East China Military and Political University.

Comrade Zhu Yusheng is an outstanding military education worker who values the combination of education and actual combat. He not only carefully studied scientific military theories, but also continuously participated in battles, absorbing experience and elevating it. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he studied stone jar mines with the militia, tested the performance of various landmines, and went with them to bury landmines and fight the enemy. He often went to the front lines to personally organize the troops' reconnaissance, explosions, and assaults. During the War of Liberation, even after his right arm was amputated, he continued to visit battlefields for observation and research. In the Jinan Campaign, he led military instructors to climb the nineteen-meter-high breach point with the second echelon to observe combat actions. After participating in battles, he often created models or sand tables of the enemy and our own combat deployments and firepower configurations, leading everyone to study them. He also combined them with scientific military theories for careful research, gathering the wisdom of the masses to improve them, and then guiding the troops. He went to the front several times during the War of Liberation to collect blasting experience, systematically studied blasting tactics, and greatly helped the troops in breaking through the enemy's strong fortifications. He also created a table of explosive usage based on the performance of explosives and the solidity of various enemy fortifications, allowing the troops to quickly determine the amount of explosives needed for effective blasting after observing the enemy's fortifications.

The military study and research under the leadership of Comrade Zhu Yusheng were closely linked to the actual situation at the front. In 1942, the Japanese and puppet troops built a large number of碉堡 (diaobao, pillboxes), attempting to divide our areas. The front-line troops generally felt a lack of effective and simple weapons in combat. Comrade Zhu Yusheng led everyone to study the direct firing method of mortars, and after several failures, finally succeeded. It played a significant role in the battles to attack Ju County and Ganyu in Shandong, boosting the confidence of commanders and fighters in capturing enemy strongholds. Comrade Zhu Yusheng also studied the tunnel blasting method, precisely calculating how much explosive was needed to effectively destroy various enemy fortifications. During the War of Liberation, when the People's Liberation Army switched to the offensive and seized the enemy's central cities, Comrade Zhu Yusheng led everyone in studying siege tactics to deal with various enemy solid fortifications. In educational work, Comrade Zhu Yusheng also adopted the principle of key intensive education based on the needs of the front, training thirty to forty teams of students who went to the front during the War of Liberation.

Comrade Zhu Yusheng's research work was closely linked to the existing material conditions. In the early stages of the War of Liberation, he improved weapons for dealing with enemy bunkers and tanks. He also improved and created various siege equipment to break through the enemy's various fortifications. However, his research work changed with the development of the war, and he constantly studied various modern weapons and modern tactics. He made great achievements in the research of artillery firing techniques. He once said: "War is constantly developing, and every military cadre must continue to develop with it."

In the spring of 1948, while he was testing a mortar firing at the enemy in front, his right arm was unfortunately broken by the firing pin and had to be amputated. As soon as he woke up after fainting, he asked: "Did the shell hit the target?" Even when he was taken to the hospital before the operation, he repeatedly told other comrades not to let his injury affect the progress of the experiment. Many comrades were moved to tears by him. He said, "As long as I have a breath, I will still work hard."

Comrade Zhu Yusheng is not only an excellent military education worker, but also an outstanding political worker. He attaches importance to the close combination of ideological education and military education, and he transformed many old soldiers into excellent military instructors. He taught them how to study scientific military theories, how to combine their military theories with practice, and to strive to supply thousands upon thousands of excellent military cadres to the front. To encourage the students to study hard, this military instructor with only one arm often appeared on the training ground to demonstrate operations. The students, inspired by him, studied even harder. Comrade Zhu Yusheng, with the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member, was loved and respected by all the students and staff of the school.

　　军事教育工作模范祝榆生
    祝榆生同志是一个重视教育与实战结合的优秀的军事教育工作者。为了革命的军事教育，他光荣地失去了一条右臂。
    十二年来从事军事教育工作的祝榆生同志，在抗日战争和解放战争中培养了成千成百的年青的军事干部走上前线。他精心研究和改进了各种攻坚技术和战术，在部队突破敌人坚固工事的战斗中起了很大的作用。十二年来他不断地实地参加战斗，在与实际结合的研究中，他创造与改进了二十余种武器和战斗器材。为了革命的军事教育，他光荣地失去了一条右臂。现在他是华东军事政治大学训练部第二处的处长。
    祝榆生同志是一个重视教育与实战结合的优秀的军事教育工作者。他不但精心研究了科学的军事理论，而且不断参加战斗，吸取经验，并把它提高起来。在抗日战争中他与民兵一起研究石罐地雷，试验各种的地雷的性能，与他们一起去埋地雷，打敌人。他经常上前线亲自组织部队的侦察、爆炸和突击。在解放战争中，他截去了右臂后，还不断地赴战地参观研究。在济南战役中，他率领了军事教员，随二梯队攀登十九公尺高的突破口，参观战斗动作。在参加战斗后，他经常把敌我的战斗布置和火力配备制成模型或沙盘，领导大家学习；并且结合科学军事理论一起精心研究，集合群众的智慧加以提高，再指导部队。他在解放战争中数次上前方收集爆破经验，系统地研究了爆破战术，使部队在突破敌人强固工事的战斗中获得很大帮助。他又根据炸药的性能和各种敌人工事的坚固程度制成炸药的使用数量表，使部队在观察敌人工事后很迅速地确定炸药的数量予以有效的爆破。
    祝榆生同志领导下的军事学习和研究是与前方实际情况密切连系着的。一九四二年日伪大量构筑碉堡，企图分割我们的地区。前方部队在战斗中普遍感到缺乏一种有效而简便的武器。祝榆生同志就领导大家研究了迫击炮的平射法，在数度实验失败后终于获得成功，在攻击山东莒县、赣榆等战斗中发挥了很大的作用，鼓舞了指战员攻取敌人据点的信心。祝榆生同志又研究了坑道爆破法，他精密计算了用多少炸药，才能有效的摧毁敌各种工事。在解放战争中，人民解放军转入进攻，夺取敌人中心城市的时候，祝榆生同志又领导大家研究了对付敌人各种坚固工事的攻坚战术。在教育工作上，祝榆生同志也根据前方的需要，采取了重点速成教育的方针，在解放战争中培养了三、四十个队的学员走上前线。
    祝榆生同志的研究工作是与现有物质条件密切联系着的。在解放战争初期他改进了对付敌人的地堡和对付敌人坦克的武器，他又改进与创造了各种攻坚器材来突破敌人的各种工事。但是他的研究工作是随着战事的发展而变化的，他又不断研究了各种近代武器和近代战术，他在炮兵射击技术的研究上有了很大的成绩。他曾经说：“战争是在不断发展的，每个军事干部都必须跟着它继续不断地发展。”
    一九四八年春天他在试验迫击炮在敌前射击的时候，不幸右臂被撞针打断而截去了。他昏倒后刚一醒来，就问：“炮弹打中目标没有？”抬到医院里还未进行手术的时候，他还谆谆嘱咐其他同志不要因他的负伤而影响试验的进行。很多同志被他感动得流下泪来。他说：“只要我有一口气，我仍要努力工作。”
    祝榆生同志不仅是一个优秀的军事教育工作者，而且是一个出色的政治工作者。他重视思想教育与军事教育密切结合，他改造了很多旧军人成为很好的军事教员。他教导他们怎样学习科学的军事理论，怎样使自己的军事理论与实际结合，为供给前方成千成万的优秀军事干部而努力。为着鼓励学员们努力学习，这个只有一条手臂的军事教员经常出现在练兵场上作示范操作。学员们在他的感召下更加紧苦学。具有共产党员优秀品质的祝榆生同志受到了全校同学和工作人员的爱戴与尊敬。
