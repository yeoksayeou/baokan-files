Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, September 3rd: Northeast farmers are welcoming this autumn's bumper harvest with unparalleled joy. From the right bank of the Ussuri River to the plains of the Liaohe River, all kinds of crops are extremely lush this year. The extremely common phenomenon is that sorghum is up to eight feet tall with ears weighing half a jin, millet ears are over a foot long, and corn plants yield three ears each. According to preliminary estimates, the overall harvest for the region this year is over 85%, exceeding a generally bountiful year and increasing by more than 20% compared to last year. Farmers are extremely delighted with this bountiful scene and are actively preparing for the harvest. Farmers in Xujia Village, Shulan County, Jilin Province, have not only bought eight new carts and repaired twelve old ones, but also prepared all other farm implements needed for the autumn harvest, such as harnesses and sickles. The more than five thousand sickles prepared by the Yitong County Cooperative for the harvest have been snapped up by farmers. Rehe Province, which has suffered from years of natural disasters, has also achieved a good harvest this year, the best in years. Farmers in the province are actively organizing autumn protection committees or autumn protection teams to prevent bad elements from sabotaging the harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, August 31st: Farmers in various parts of Northeast China have reclaimed a total of 5,397,000 mu of wasteland in the spring and summer seasons this year, bringing the region's cultivated land area to over 155,530,000 mu.

After the land reform, farmers in various parts of Northeast China, encouraged by the people's government's policy of rewarding the expansion of cultivated land area, showed extremely high enthusiasm for land reclamation. In the two years of 1948 and 1949, the region increased its cultivated land by a total of 14,723,000 mu due to land reclamation. This year, due to favorable conditions such as the strengthening of labor mutual aid organizations, the increase in livestock, and the large-scale use of improved farm tools, the land reclamation plan was completed ahead of schedule in the spring and summer seasons, exceeding the original plan by 32%. In the northern Manchurian provinces of Heilongjiang and Songjiang, formerly known as the "Great Northern Wilderness," a total of 2,937,000 mu of wasteland has been reclaimed in the spring and summer seasons, accounting for about 4% of the total cultivated land area of the two provinces this year. Three-quarters of the counties (banners) in Heilongjiang Province had already exceeded their land reclamation plans by the end of the spring plowing, with Hailong, Longjiang and other six counties exceeding the plan by more than double. Yilan and Huanan counties in Songjiang Province also exceeded their original land reclamation plans by three or two times, respectively. In the southern Manchurian provinces of Liaodong and Liaoxi, which have less wasteland, a total of over one million mu of wasteland have also been reclaimed this year. Farmers in Kuandian, Fengcheng and other counties in Liaodong Province, which have more mountainous areas, have almost cultivated all the sandy hills and mountain slopes that can grow crops. Farmers in the southern plain areas of the province have improved the low-lying ponds and alkaline land that were previously considered completely unsuitable for cultivation, making them suitable for crop growth. Farmers in Rehe Province, who are continuing to fight against natural disasters, have also restored and newly reclaimed 848,800 mu of land this year, increasing the province's cultivated land area by 6% compared to last year.

The over-fulfillment of land reclamation plans in various parts of Northeast China will play a significant role in achieving the region's agricultural production plan and increasing farmers' incomes this year. For example, the 1.4 million mu of wasteland reclaimed in Songjiang Province this year is estimated to increase grain production by 161,400 tons.

　　从乌苏里江到辽河平原作物肥壮
    东北农民迎接今秋大丰收
    全区农民大力开荒扩大耕地五百万亩
    【新华社沈阳三日电】东北农民正以无比的喜悦迎接今秋大丰收。从乌苏里江的右岸到辽河的平原上，今年各种作物均极肥壮。极普遍的现象是高粱高达八尺，穗重半斤，谷子穗长尺余，玉米一棵结穗三个。据初步估计，今年全区的年景在八成半以上，超过一般丰收的年成，比去年增产二成多。农民对此种丰收景象，欣喜异常，正积极准备收获。吉林省舒兰县徐家村农民，除已买进八辆新车，修理了十二辆旧车外，其他秋收需用的马套、镰刀等农具均已备妥。伊通县合作社为收割准备的五千余把镰刀，已被农民争买一空。连年灾荒的热河省，今年亦获得数年来未有的好收成。该省农民正纷纷组织护秋委员会或护秋队，防止坏分子破坏秋收。
    【新华社沈阳八月三十一日电】东北各地农民今年春、夏两季共开垦荒地五百三十九万七千余亩，使全区耕地面积现已恢复与扩大至一亿五千五百三十余万亩。
    土地改革后，东北各地农民在人民政府奖励扩大耕地面积政策的鼓励下，开荒热情极为高涨。全区在一九四八年和一九四九年的两年内，共因开荒而增加耕地一千四百七十二万三千余亩。今年各地更因劳动互助组织加强、牲畜增多、以及改良农具的大量使用等有利条件，终使今年开荒计划提前在春、夏两季中完成，并超过原计划的百分之三十二。旧称“北大荒”的北满黑龙江、松江两省，今年春、夏两季中共已开荒二百九十三万七千余亩，占该两省今年总耕地面积百分之四左右。黑龙江省全省四分之三的县（旗）在春耕结束时即已超过了开荒计划，其中海龙、龙江等六县超过计划一倍以上。松江省的依兰、桦南两县也各超过原订开荒计划的三倍或两倍。荒地较少的南满辽东、辽西两省，今年也共开荒一百余万亩。辽东省山地较多的宽甸、凤城等县农民，几乎开尽了所有能种庄稼的沙岗和山坡；该省南部平原地带的农民，则改良了过去认为根本不能种地的洼塘和碱地，使其适于作物的生长。正在继续与灾荒作斗争的热河省农民，今年也恢复与新开荒地八十四万八千余亩，使全省的耕地面积较去年增加了百分之六。
    东北各地开荒计划的超额完成，对实现该区今年农业生产计划和增加农民收入将有很大作用。如松江省今年所开的一百四十万亩荒地，估计即能增产十六万一千四百余吨粮食。
