Xinhua News Agency, September 2nd: The *World Knowledge* weekly published an editorial on September 2nd titled "Fifth Anniversary of Japan's Surrender," stating: "On September 2, 1945, with the signing of the Japanese Instrument of Surrender, the Second World War, provoked by militaristic fascist aggressors, came to an end. At that time, people all over the world were overjoyed, preparing to recover from the wounds of war, devoting themselves to construction, and spending peaceful, happy, free, and independent days together. Under the guarantee of the Potsdam Declaration, the Japanese people also gained the opportunity to embark on a new path towards democracy and freedom."

The editorial continued: "However, although fascist aggressors such as Germany, Italy, and Japan were defeated, the American imperialists then took their place with even more ferocious behavior. In the past five years, American imperialism has gone back on its word, trampled on international treaties, infringed upon national independence and freedom, destroyed human rights, massacred peaceful people, deceived, lied, and plundered. The crimes of undermining world peace and tranquility are countless."

The editorial then pointed out the more barbaric acts of aggression recently carried out by American imperialism in the Far East, stating: "While launching armed aggression against Korea, the American aggressors openly declared that they would use force to obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and then formally occupied Taiwan with armed force. Now, they have intensified their actions. On August 27th, aggressive U.S. military aircraft brutally intruded into Chinese airspace and repeatedly strafed the right bank of the Yalu River, destroying Chinese buildings, stations, and vehicles, and killing and injuring Chinese people."

"In Japan, American imperialism exercises exclusive control, violates the Potsdam Declaration and the basic policies of the Far Eastern Commission towards Japan, and violates various other agreements. Its actions over the past five years have been notorious. In the aggressive war against Korea, American imperialism has openly used Japan as a war base for commanding the war, dispatching troops, and supplying munitions. Moreover, it is actively engaged in forming a Japanese army, attempting to drive the Japanese people to serve as cannon fodder. In other parts of the Far East, American imperialism is also colluding with reactionary forces everywhere, consistently engaging in despicable anti-people behavior."

The editorial concluded by emphasizing: "American imperialism has become an enemy of world peace, especially a vicious enemy of the people of the East. The blood debts of the past five years are like this, and new crimes continue to follow. With deep-seated hatred, we can no longer tolerate the aggressor American imperialism. The Korean people are bravely striking the aggressive bandits, and the Japanese people are also widely launching a strong struggle against American imperialism; the Chinese people will never allow the aggressive actions of American imperialism. Taiwan must be liberated. Whoever dares to provoke will surely suffer the consequences. Five years ago, the Chinese and Asian people were able to defeat the rampant Japanese imperialism. Today, five years later, we are even more confident in defeating the mad aggression of American imperialism, the successor of Japan. The people of Asia unite, form unparalleled strength, and will surely crush the bloody aggressive conspiracy of American imperialism."

### 日本签降五周年  《世界知识》社评

　　日本签降五周年
    《世界知识》社评
    【新华社二日讯】此间《世界知识》周刊二日以《日本签降五周年》为题，发表社评称：一九四五年九月二日，随着日本投降书的签立，结束了由穷兵黩武的法西斯侵略者所挑起的第二次世界大战。当时，全世界人民莫不兴高采烈，准备从事恢复战争的创伤，致力建设，共度和平、安乐、自由、独立的日子。日本人民在波茨坦宣言保障下，也获得了走向民主自由的新道路的机会。
    社评继称：可是，德、意、日等法西斯侵略者虽然被击倒了，美帝国主义者竟接着以更凶暴的行为代之而起。五年来，美帝国主义背信弃义，蹂躏国际条约，侵犯民族独立自由，摧残人权，屠杀和平人民，欺骗撒谎和强取豪夺，种种破坏世界和平安宁的罪行，数不胜数。
    社评接着指出美帝国主义最近在远东实行的更蛮横的侵略行为称：与发动武装侵略朝鲜的同时，美国侵略者公然宣称要用武力阻挠中国人民解放台湾，并即进而正式武装侵占台湾。现更变本加厉，于八月二十七日，以侵略朝鲜的军用飞机狂暴地侵入中国领空，沿鸭绿江右岸连续扫射数次，毁坏中国的建筑物、车站和车辆，并杀伤中国人民。
    在日本，美帝独霸管制，破坏波茨坦宣言和远东委员会对日的基本政策及违背其他各种约言。五年来所作所为，罪行昭著。对朝鲜的侵略战中，美帝已公开把日本作为指挥战争、调遣军队与供应军火的战争基地。且进而积极从事编练日本军队，企图驱使日本人民充当炮灰。在远东其它各地，美帝也到处勾结着反动势力，一贯从事反人民的卑劣行为。
    社评结语强调称：美帝已经成为世界和平的敌人，特别是东方人民的凶恶无比的敌人。五年来的血账如此，新的罪行又紧接未已，血海深仇，对于美帝国主义这个侵略者，我们已经再没有忍让的余地。朝鲜人民正在英勇地予侵略者强盗以打击，日本人民也正在广泛展开反对美帝国主义的坚强斗争；中国人民也绝不会允许美帝国主义的侵略妄行，台湾一定要解放，谁敢于挑衅，谁就一定自食其果。五年以前，中国以至亚洲人民能够打败猖獗一时的日本帝国主义，五年以后的今天，我们更有把握打败日本继承者美帝国主义的疯狂侵略。亚洲人民团结起来，结成无比的力量，定能粉碎美帝国主义血腥侵略的阴谋。
