　　After the American Aggression in the Korean War:
    The Anti-War Struggle of the Japanese Working Class
    Xiangtian Yongfu

　　Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the American imperialists' plot to turn Japan into a military base has been accelerating and materializing. The whole of Japan is about to be incorporated into a wartime system.

　　However, the Japanese working class, under the intensified plunder of American imperialism, has risen up and launched a widespread and tenacious resistance against the crimes of the American imperialists in provoking war and exploiting the Japanese people.

　　We can fully see the attitude of the Japanese working class towards the Korean War from the following facts: For example, the Japan Seamen's Union, originally affiliated with the World Federation of Free Trade Unions controlled by international labor traitors and always dominated by vicious social democrats, passed a resolution at an emergency struggle meeting, upon the strong advocacy of a Communist Party cadre, that "The Japanese people have accepted the Potsdam Declaration, and the Constitution clearly stipulates the renunciation of armed force and war. Therefore, we should not participate in the Korean War," and also made demands on the government to protect "seafarers who may suffer accidental losses," etc. Another example is the Japan National Railway Workers' Union, the largest trade union organization in Japan, which held a congress after the outbreak of the Korean War. Although the social democrats tried their best to sabotage it, their proposals were rejected. The congress adopted the proposal of the Communist Party representative and passed a resolution to "strive for overall peace, neutrality, and national independence."

            II

　　The mass struggle against participation in the Korean War was first concretely manifested in the Yokosuka and Yokohama areas. The workers expressed their attitude towards the Korean War by using enthusiastic actions in opposing the work of transporting weapons and ammunition.

　　At the beginning of the Korean War, the employment agencies in Kanagawa Prefecture immediately planned to recruit 5,000 Japanese workers to transport ammunition with "generous" conditions of 450 yen per day and two meals provided (at present, the average wage for recruiting unemployed workers in Japan is 250 yen per day). However, on June 27, when unemployed workers applying for work at the Tsurumi Employment Agency heard that it was for transporting ammunition, all but seven refused to accept this kind of work. The seven unemployed workers who accepted the ammunition transportation work, after getting on the truck, listened to the patient advice of Korean and Japanese workers, and saw the touching actions of unemployed workers standing arm in arm in front of the truck to prevent it from starting. They immediately changed their selfish ideas and voluntarily got out of the car. On the same day, the same incident occurred at the Kanazawa Employment Agency in Yokohama City.

　　On the other hand, unemployed workers who were mobilized to participate in the transportation of ammunition began to go slow after seeing leaflets distributed by progressive workers against the aggressive war in Korea. The go-slow phenomenon was even more intense at night. The workers hid behind gasoline drums to doze off. Although American soldiers often used the sirens on jeeps to urge the workers to work, the workers at most only moved around and changed places to doze off. Not only did they not participate in the work, but also at 11:00 p.m., all the workers seemed to have a pre-arranged agreement and rushed to the American supervisor's office to demand late-night snacks, scaring the Americans so much that they had to comply with their demands and provide the snacks. Therefore, the American supervisor wrote in his work report to his superiors: "The work efficiency of Japanese workers is low, and they can only complete one-quarter of the scheduled work." Although the Japanese police immediately investigated and prosecuted Korean workers who distributed leaflets when they were discovered, the go-slow phenomenon did not stop.

　　Among the workers' anti-war struggles, the seafarers' anti-participation-in-the-Korean-War sentiment was the highest and strongest. The struggle of senior crew members who had participated in World War II was particularly fierce. One of the "Liberty ships" that was immediately mobilized when the war broke out, from the crew to the cooks, all refused to board the ship; in addition, another "Liberty ship" saw all the senior crew members leave the ship.

　　When the seafarers were first mobilized, it was difficult to carry out work among the seafarers because the authorities used all kinds of sweet words as bait and because the Seamen's Union was controlled by vicious social democrats. Therefore, the seafarers' resistance was not apparent, but as time went on, this resistance gradually developed. Especially the seafarers who had been to Korea once and then returned were even more dissatisfied. At this point, mass actions arose. First of all, the Takasago Maru, which had sailed to Korea and returned to Wakamatsu Port, was not escorted when it returned from Korea, as the communists had predicted. Therefore, all the crew members felt that this kind of voyage was too dangerous, so they decided to refuse to continue boarding the ship.

　　The oil tanker No. 7 Nanryu Maru (880 tons) of the Japan Merchant Shipping Company, which was moored in Yokohama Port, held a crew meeting on board on July 14 and passed a resolution: "In the Pacific War, our crew members suffered as much as 45 percent of the total casualties. We have fully tasted the bitter taste of war. Now, due to the war in Korea, the crew members are the first to bear the brunt and will be involved in foreign wars. We have accepted the Potsdam Declaration, and the Constitution also clearly stipulates the renunciation of war. We demand peace. What will our families think if they hear that we are about to be involved in the war? Therefore, our crew members must also shout the slogan that the people of the whole country are unanimously shouting: 'We don't want war'."

　　Since the outbreak of the Korean War, the land transportation of military supplies has also increased greatly, so railway workers have been forced to accept unbearably heavy work, which has led to the go-slow struggle of railway workers. On July 8, twenty of the thirty freight handlers at Shinjuku Railway Station in Tokyo were absent without reason, so the remaining ten had to do more work than usual, resulting in all of them falling ill. For example, the road maintenance workers in Manazuru, Kanagawa Prefecture, refused to work overtime because their request for overtime pay was not granted. There are countless such examples. Especially the Yokohama Shintsurumi shunting yard, which has as many as 2,000 staff members, has to shunt 70 to 75 trains a day since the Korean War began, which is more than the number of shunting trains during the most tense period of transportation in the Pacific War. The labor intensity of each worker has been increased by more than double, resulting in a large increase in the number of patients. Therefore, the workers have put forward demands for increased workers and temporary allowances, and the dissatisfaction has reached a saturation point.

　　The most skillful struggle, which cleverly organized go-slows and resistance, was the shipbuilding workers. American imperialism has listed Japan's ship construction work as part of the militarization of Japan and forced Japan to lease American ships. In order to force Japan to lease American surplus wartime ships that could be armed at any time, Japan's own shipbuilding plan for 1950 was extremely compressed in order to turn Japanese shipbuilding factories into repair factories specializing in repairing American ships. The All-Japan Shipbuilding Workers' Union, which supports the World Federation of Trade Unions organization, has carried out a nationwide unified struggle to save the destruction of the Japanese shipbuilding industry. Among them, the Nagasaki Shipyard Workers' Union of the Mitsubishi system, the largest shipbuilding factory in Japan with 12,000 workers, has been carrying out strikes, key strikes, demonstrations, and refusal to tow back American power generation ships such as the Jark XII from Busan, Korea, since the beginning of June, thus forming the driving force of this struggle. Since the beginning of the Korean War, the company's shipbuilding factories in Kanagawa Prefecture have received a large number of contracts to repair American landing craft, while the shipbuilding factories in Kansai have also received a large number of orders for security boats from the expanding Maritime Safety Agency, forcing workers to increase their labor intensity to an unbearable degree. Therefore, although the American emperor sent armed soldiers to guard around the factory, the workers were not afraid of the bayonets and were ready to stand up at any time and launch a struggle. The largest Kobe Kawasaki Shipyard in Kansai has decided to hold a general strike to demand timely allowances. In addition, the Kawasaki Steel Plant, which has 13,000 workers, and the Tsurumi Steel Plant, which has 6,000 workers, which belong to the steel sector of Kanto Japan Steel Pipe Company, the 독점 capital king of the steel and shipbuilding industry, have also decided to launch a strike struggle to demand timely allowances. This struggle is spreading to the company's shipbuilding sector.

　　Adjacent to this factory, the Uraga Dock Yokohama Factory, which has 300 workers, also began to repair six landing craft in early July. The struggle of this factory started like this: a worker in a work department was working with a cigarette in his mouth. After being seen by an American supervisor, the supervisor snatched the cigarette and threw it away. As a result, it caused the resistance of all the workers in this work department. Every worker deliberately worked with a cigarette in his mouth to express their protest. The Japanese supervisors tried several times to interfere and stop them, but they were finally afraid to interfere because they were accused by the workers of being "running dogs of the foreign devils". They also implemented go-slows.

　　When the Korean War broke out, the Tsurumi Shipyard of Japan Steel Pipe Company organized mass peace committees in many work departments, carried out the signature campaign for the Stockholm Peace Appeal, and launched an active struggle to support peace. Later, because the workers' economic demands were not fully answered, they used this organization to go-slow struggles, of which the go-slows in the landing craft outfitting work were the most thorough. On July 14, forty young workers held a demonstration in the factory despite the reactionary government's ban.

　　Other anti-war struggles of metal workers are by no means behind shipbuilding workers. Since the announcement of the dismissal of 5,500 workers, the 6,000 workers of the Hitachi Manufacturing Co. General Division Factory (located in Hitachi City, Ibaraki Prefecture), who have been continuing their strong struggle for more than 70 days, have stopped completing the streetcars exported to South Korea, making this batch of ordered streetcars unable to leave the factory and be transported away for a long time. At the same time, 500 workers at the Tokyo Japan Special Steel Pipe Factory have stopped producing steel pipes exported to South Korea due to the issue of laying off workers, and have continued an indefinite strike for more than 20 days. For example, the Tokyo Factory of Japan Special Steel Company, which specializes in producing military supplies for the occupying forces, also has 900 workers who have put forward economic demands and refused to work overtime. When hundreds of workers from the Tokyo Factory of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co. were sent on business trips to the Yokosuka Fuji Motor Factory to specialize in repairing military supplies, they refused this errand. Although black soldiers stood guard at the gate to stop them, they ignored everything and all the workers took eight trucks and rushed out of the gate at a speed of 40 kilometers per hour and drove back to their factory.

            III

　　The various facts mentioned above are only a very small part of the examples of the anti-war struggles launched by Japanese workers. The brilliant victory of the North Korean People's Army and the repeated defeats of the American imperialist invading army have shattered the Japanese people's idea of "respecting the United States" and encouraged the courage and fighting confidence of the Japanese working class. All the signs show that this anti-war struggle will inevitably develop more widely, and the current semi-autonomous state will surely grow into a more politically purposeful and conscious struggle. The way of struggle will also be more highly developed. This struggle will force the American imperialists to realize that Japan is not a safe military base and will eventually have to get out.

　　美国侵略朝鲜战争发生后
    日本工人阶级的反战斗争
    相田勇夫
    朝鲜战争发生以来，美国帝国主义要把日本变成军事基地的阴谋加速地具体化起来。整个日本，快要被编成一个战时体制了。
    然而，在美帝国主义加紧掠夺下的日本的工人阶级却已挺身而起，对美国帝国主义者这种挑拨战争和压榨日本人民的罪行，展开了广泛而顽强的反抗。
    我们可以从下面几个事实，充分看出日本工人阶级对朝鲜战争所抱的态度：例如日本海员工会，本隶属于为国际工贼所把持的世界自由工会联盟，一向为凶恶的社会民主主义者所支配，在一次紧急的斗争会议中，一位共产党员干部提出坚决的主张，即大会通过决议：“日本国民已接受波茨坦宣言，而宪法亦明文规定放弃武力和战争。因此，不应参与朝鲜战争”，同时并对政府提出了保护“可能遭受意外损失的海员”等要求。又如日本最大的工会组织——国铁工会，在朝鲜战事发生后，曾召开大会，虽然社会民主主义者曾竭力加以破坏，然而他们的提案却遭到了否决，大会采纳共产党员代表的主张，通过了“争取全面媾和、争取中立与民族独立”的决议。
            二
    反对参与朝鲜战争的群众斗争，首先在横须贺、横滨地带具体表现出来了。工人们用激昂的行动，在反对运输武器弹药的工作中，表示了他们对朝鲜战争的态度。
    朝鲜战争一开始，神奈川县属各职业介绍所就立即以每天四百五十元并供给两餐伙食的“优厚”条件，打算招募五千名运输弹药的日工工人（目前日本招募失业工人的工资，一般为每天平均二百五十元）。然而，六月二十七日向鹤见职业介绍所要求工作的失业工人，一听到是运输弹药，除了七名之外，全部拒绝接受此种工作。而接受运输弹药工作的七个失业工人，搭上卡车后，听到了朝鲜工人和日本工人耐心的劝告，看到了臂挽着臂站在卡车前面阻止开行的失业工人的使人感动的行动，立刻改变了自私的念头，自动地走下汽车来。在同一天，横滨市内的金泽职业介绍所也发生了同样的事件。
    另方面，被动员参加运输弹药工作的失业工人，看到了进步工人散发的反对侵略朝鲜战争的传单后，开始怠工。在夜间，怠工现象更为激烈，工人们均藏到汽油筒后面打盹，美国兵虽然经常用吉普车上的警笛督促工人工作，但工人们顶多亦仅走动一下，另换打盹地点而已。非但不参加工作，而且一到半夜十一时，全部工人便似乎预先已有暗约似地，一起拥到美国人监工官处要求供给夜点，使美国人吓得发抖，不得不依从其要求而供给夜点。美国人监工官因此在其对上司的工作报告中写道：“日本工人工作效率低劣，仅能完成预定工作的四分之一。”日本警察虽然一发现散发传单的朝鲜工人便立即加以检举，然而怠工现象并不因而稍有停歇。
    在工人的反战斗争中，海员们反对参与朝鲜战争的斗争情绪最高也最坚强，参加过第二次世界大战的高级船员的斗争，尤为激烈。战争一发生就立即被动员的“自由轮”中的一只船，上自船员下至伙夫，全部拒绝上船；此外，另一只“自由轮”并发生了高级船员全部离船的情况。
    当海员们最初被动员时，由于当局用各种甜言蜜语为饵，又因为海员工会受着凶恶的社会民主主义者的支配，在海员中工作是很难开展的。因此，海员的反抗并未表面化，然而随着时间的推移，这一反抗即逐渐发展，尤其到过一次朝鲜后再回来的海员，情绪更加不满，至此，群众性的行动就起来了。首先，曾驶往朝鲜后回到若松港的高砂丸，正如共产主义者所预言的，从朝鲜驶回时并未受到护航，因此，全体船员认为此种航行未免太危险，遂决议拒绝继续上船。
    停泊在横滨港的日本商船公司的运油船第七南隆丸（八八○吨），曾于七月十四日在船内召开船员大会，通过决议：“在太平洋战争中，我们船员之牺牲共达百分之四十五之巨，我们已充分尝过战争的悲惨滋味。现在由于朝鲜的战事，船员又首当其冲，将被卷入外国的战争。我们已接受波茨坦宣言，而且宪法亦明文规定放弃战争，我们要求和平。我们的家族若听到我们即将被卷入战祸，将发生何种感想？因此，我们船员也不得不高呼全国国民所一致高呼的口号：‘我们不要战争’。”
    自从朝鲜战事爆发以后，军需品的陆地运输亦大为增加，因此，又强迫铁道工人接受难于胜任的加重工作，于是，引起了铁道工人的怠工斗争。七月八日，东京新宿火车站三十名运货员中，因有二十名无故不到，致使剩下的十名不得不做比平常还要繁重的工作，结果全体病倒了。又如：神奈川县真鹤养路工人因要求加班工作津贴未得结果，便拒绝超加班工作。此类实例不胜枚举。尤其拥有工作人员达二千人之多的横滨新鹤见调车场，因劳动强度过高，朝鲜战争一开始，每天必调车达七十列至七十五列之多，超过太平洋战争中运输最紧张时期的调配车数，每一个工人的劳动强度均被提高一倍以上，致使病人大增，因此，工人就提出了增加工人和临时津贴的要求，不满的情绪已达饱和点。
    把怠工和抵抗巧妙地组织起来，并展开了最巧妙的斗争的，要算造船工人。美国帝国主义已将日本的船舶修建工作列为日本军事基地化的一环，强迫日本租用美国船，并为了将美国过剩的随时可能武装起来的战时型船舶强制租给日本，因此，极端压缩了日本本身一九五○年度的造船计划，以便遂行使日本造船工厂变成专门修理美国船舶的修理工厂。拥护世界工联组织的全日本造船工会，为了拯救日本造船工业的毁灭，已进行了全国的统一斗争。其中拥有一万二千名工人的日本最大造船工厂——三菱系统的长崎造船厂工会，自六月上旬即已开始彼伏此起的罢工、重点罢工、示威游行，以及拒绝从朝鲜釜山拖回美国火力发电船嘉克十二号等船，从而形成了这种斗争的推动力。从朝鲜战争开始后，该公司神奈川县境的造船工厂即接到大量修理美国登陆艇的合同，同时，关西的造船厂亦接到正在扩充中的海上保安厅的保安艇的大批订货，强迫工人提高劳动强度到令人不堪忍受的程度。因此，美帝虽然派了武装士兵在工厂周围警戒，而工人们对刺刀却并不感到畏缩，准备随时挺身而起，展开斗争。关西最大的神户川崎造船厂，为了要求应时津贴，已决议举行全体罢工。又钢铁与造船工业独占资本大王的关东日本钢管公司钢铁部门所属拥有一万三千名工人的川崎炼钢厂和拥有六千名工人的鹤见炼钢厂，亦为了要求应时津贴而决议展开罢工斗争。这种斗争正在波及到该公司的造船部门。
    这一工厂的毗邻，拥有三百名工人的浦贺船坞横滨工厂，亦在七月上旬即着手修理六只登陆艇。这个工厂的斗争是这样开始的：有一个工作部门的一个工人口含香烟在工作，被美国人监工看到后，将香烟抢去扔掉了，结果，引起了这个工作部门全体工人的反抗，每一个工人便有意含香烟工作，表示抗议。日本监工几次想去干涉制止，因被工人们指摘为“洋鬼子的走狗”而终于不敢加以干涉。他们也实行了怠工。
    日本钢管公司鹤见造船厂在朝鲜战争发生时，便在很多工作部门组织了群众性的和平委员会，进行斯德哥尔摩和平呼吁书的签名运动，展开了积极的拥护和平斗争，后因工人对经济的要求未能获得完满的答复，便把这个组织机构运用于怠工斗争，其中以登陆艇舣装工作的怠工最为彻底。七月十四日这天，即有四十名青年工人不顾反动政府的禁令，在厂内举行了示威游行。
    其他如五金工人的反战斗争，也决不落后于造船工人。自从发表开除五千五百名工人之后，一直继续七十多天坚强斗争中的日立制作所总司工厂（设茨城县日立市）的六千名工人，已停止完成向南朝鲜输出的电车，使这批订货电车迟迟不能出厂运走。同时，东京日本特殊钢管工厂五百名工人，已因解雇工人问题而停止生产向南朝鲜输出的钢管，并已继续进行了二十多天的无限期罢工。又如专门为占领军生产军需品的日本特殊钢公司东京工厂，也有九百名工人提出经济要求从而拒绝了加班工作。三菱重工业公司东京工厂的数百名工人，被派公差至横须富士马达工厂专门修理军用品时，即拒绝了这种差事。虽然有黑人士兵在大门口站岗阻止，他们仍不顾一切，全体工人分乘八辆卡车，以每小时四十公里的速度冲出大门，开回自己的工厂。
            三
    上面所述种种事实，仅仅是日本劳动者展开反战斗争的极小部分例子而已。北朝鲜人民军辉煌的胜利与美国帝国主义侵略军的节节败退，已打破了日本人民的“尊美”思想，并鼓励了日本工人阶级的勇气和斗争信心。种种迹象证明，这种反战斗争必然会更加广泛地发展下去，目前的半自流状态，必能成长为更富有政治目的和有意识的斗争。斗争的方式，亦必定更加高度化。这一斗争将迫使美国帝国主义者不得不认识到日本并不是一个安全的军事基地，而终于不得不滚出去。
