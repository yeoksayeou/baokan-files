　　Asian People Unite Against American Imperialist Aggression
    Gao Ji
    "September 18th" marks the day nineteen years ago when Japanese imperialism launched its war of aggression against the Chinese people; it also marks the beginning of Japanese imperialism's expanded aggression and widespread armed attacks against the people of Asian countries. The Second World War, in the East, began with the "September 18th" incident, the open aggression of Japanese imperialism, and victoriously ended with the Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler's fascism in Europe, sending troops into Northeast China, crushing the elite Japanese Kwantung Army, and forcing Japan to formally surrender.

    The Second World War launched by Japanese, German, and Italian imperialism ultimately resulted in their own destruction. Simultaneously, in Europe, people's democratic countries emerged in Eastern Europe, and the power of the working people within Western European capitalist countries grew increasingly strong. In Asia, the great victory of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the national independence and liberation struggles and democratic movements in other countries reached unprecedented heights in Asian history. This great historical fact should serve as a serious historical lesson for the imperialist warmongers who are attempting to launch another world war. However, even though it has not been long since Tojo, Hitler, and others were severely punished by the people of various countries, it is already clear that American imperialism has openly embarked on the old road taken by Japanese and German imperialism. Especially in the eyes of the people of Asian countries, American imperialism has completely replaced the former position of Japanese imperialism, becoming the largest aggressor in Asia and the common enemy of the people of Asian countries.

    American imperialism's aggression against the people of Asian countries has a long history, and it has become most blatant since the occupation of Japan and the gradual transformation of Japan into its Far East base for aggression. The American imperialism's occupation of Japan was entrusted by the Allied countries who defeated Japan, to implement the terms of surrender in the Potsdam Declaration. However, for five years, American imperialism has acted arbitrarily in Japan, brazenly violating the Potsdam Declaration it signed and many resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission on the Japan issue, actively supporting Japanese fascist forces, developing Japanese military industries, and even openly arming Japan, making it an aggressive tool for American imperialism to attack the people of Asian countries. Recently, since the US has launched a war of aggression against Korea, armed aggression against Taiwan, strengthened interference in Vietnam and the Philippines, and invaded our country's Northeast airspace and strafed the Northeast border, the US has further indulged the Japanese fascist forces, attempting to use them as accomplices in its war of aggression.

    Clearly, the situation facing the people of Asian countries today is very clear. American imperialism is, on the one hand, antagonizing the people of Asian countries with its own direct acts of aggression, and on the other hand, openly arming Japanese fascist forces in preparation for expanding aggression. Shortly after the outbreak of the Korean War, warmonger MacArthur ordered the Yoshida puppet government to increase the police force, a disguised army, to a number almost equal to the size of Japan's pre-war regular army. At the same time, Truman appointed another warmonger, Dulles, to step up preparations for a separate peace treaty with Japan in order to remove obstacles to Japan's large-scale rearmament. According to a United Press report on the 14th, the content of this separate treaty is that "the American draft peace treaty will not stipulate a ban on the rearmament of Japan," and "US bases will be maintained for a considerable period of time in accordance with separate bilateral agreements." This sinister conspiracy of American imperialism is not only a serious violation of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration, but is tantamount to an open act of defiance against the people of all of Asia. Because it is very clear: American imperialism is clearly attempting to massively arm the Japanese fascist forces in order to supplement its already insufficient military power and its very limited manpower. That is to say, the large-scale rearmament of Japan by American imperialism means a greater threat to peace in Asia. The people of Asian countries, especially the Chinese people, who have suffered deeply from the disasters caused by the Japanese invaders during the Second World War, resolutely oppose this conspiracy of American imperialism.

    As is well known, the monstrous crimes of American imperialism in expanding its aggression in Asia are not a new conspiracy, but a development of the evil policy it has been implementing in the five years since it occupied Japan. In the past five years, American imperialism has taken many measures in Japan that have harmed the people of Asian countries. Just looking at the war criminals issue can fully reveal the attitude of American imperialism. American imperialism has shielded the war criminal group headed by Hirohito and has successively released large numbers of war criminals who had been arrested since June 1946. These included former Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Army Yasuji Okamura and Nishio Toshizo, who had slaughtered the Chinese people, and other big and small executioners whose hands were stained with the blood of the Chinese people and the people of other countries in Southeast Asia. Not only that, but on March 7th of this year, warmonger MacArthur publicly announced the so-called "oath release system," which would release all Japanese war criminals who had been convicted by Allied military tribunals in batches. The Soviet government sent notes to the US government twice, on May 11th and August 25th, sternly criticizing the illegality of this "directive" to release war criminals early and demanding that this "directive" be revoked immediately. The Chinese people fully support the just position of the Soviet government, because it is in the common interests of the Chinese people and the people of Asian countries. This illegal act of the US government not only violates the international agreements on punishing Japanese war criminals, but also publicly declares to the world its close blood relationship with those executioners who slaughtered the people of Asian countries.

    Along with the Japanese war criminals, Japan's military industries and military bases have also been retained by American imperialism and used as tools for aggression against Asian countries. In the crime of aggression against Taiwan, American imperialism instructed war criminals such as former commander of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army, Nemoto Hiroshi, to organize so-called "volunteer soldiers" to prevent us from liberating Taiwan; and in the war of aggression against Korea, American imperialism's aircraft and warships mostly departed from air and naval bases in Japan to attack and bomb the Korean people. At the same time, under the cover of MacArthur, Japan's 300 aircraft factories, 170 arsenals, and hundreds of other military-related enterprises such as shipyards, steel mills, and chemical factories have all started operations, manufacturing and repairing various weapons in large quantities for American imperialism. Clearly, Japan under the occupation of American imperialism has become a base and arsenal for American imperialism's war of aggression in Asia. American imperialism's reactionary measures in Japan and towards Asian countries should be resolutely combated, and it can be defeated. The experience of the Chinese people's victory proves this, and a new struggle is underway. The heroic Korean people are giving the aggressors a heavy blow, the Japanese people are also widely launching a resolute struggle against American imperialism; the people of other Asian countries are also becoming increasingly aware and increasingly united. The combination of the strength of the people of Asian countries, together with the common efforts of the world's peace camp, will surely be able to drive American imperialism out of Asia and restore peace in Asia.

    We must firmly believe that the people of Asian countries, who defeated Japanese imperialism, are confident today of defeating the mad aggression of American imperialism, the successor of Japan.

　　亚洲人民团结起来反对美帝侵略
    高集
    “九、一八”，这是十九年前日本帝国主义向中国人民发动侵略战争的日子；同时，也是日本帝国主义扩大侵略，向亚洲各国人民广泛进行武装进攻的开始。第二次世界大战，在东方是以“九、一八”日帝的公开侵略为最初的导火线，而以苏联在欧洲战败希特勒法西斯后出兵我国东北，击溃了日军精锐的关东军，迫使日本正式投降而胜利的结束的。
    日、德、意帝国主义所发动的第二次世界大战，其最后的结果，便是它们自己的灭亡。同时，在欧洲大陆上出现了东欧各人民民主国家，以及西欧各资本主义国家内部劳动人民力量的日益壮大；在亚洲，便是在中国共产党领导下的中国人民的伟大胜利，和其他各国家民族独立解放斗争和民主运动进入了亚洲历史上从所未有的高潮。这个伟大的历史事实，对于企图发动另一次大战的帝国主义战争贩子，应该是一个严重的历史教训。但是，就在东条和希特勒等遭受了各国人民严重惩治还不很久的今天，人们已经清楚地看到，美帝国主义便公然走上了日、德帝国主义所走过的老路。尤其，在亚洲各国人民的面前，美帝国主义已完全代替了以前日本帝国主义的地位，成为亚洲最大的侵略者，成为亚洲各国人民的公敌。
    美帝国主义对亚洲各国人民的侵略由来已久，而以占领日本并逐步变日本为其远东侵略基地以来为最露骨。美帝国主义之占领日本，是以接受打败日本的同盟国家的委托，执行波茨坦宣言中的日本投降条款为任务的。但是，五年来，美帝国主义在日本独断专行，蛮横地违背了自己在上面签字的波茨坦宣言，和远东委员会关于日本问题的许多决议，而积极扶植日本法西斯势力，发展日本军事工业，甚至公开武装日本，使其成为美帝国主义进攻亚洲各国人民的侵略工具。最近，在美帝发动侵略朝鲜战争、武装侵略台湾、加强对越南与菲律宾的干涉，并侵犯我国东北领空，扫射东北边境以来，美帝更加放纵日本法西斯势力，企图以之作侵略战争的鹰犬。
    很明显，今天摆在亚洲各国人民面前的形势是十分明白的。美帝一面以自己的直接侵略行为与亚洲各国人民为敌，一面公开进行武装日本法西斯势力，为扩大侵略作准备。在侵朝战事发生后不久，战贩麦克阿瑟便令吉田傀儡政府增加变相陆军的警察力量，使其数目几等于日本战前常备军的数目。与此同时，杜鲁门并指派了另一个战贩杜勒斯加紧筹备单独的对日和约，以扫除日本大规模重整军备的障碍。这个单独和约的内容，据合众社十四日的报道，“美国起草的和约草案将不规定禁止重整日本军备”，同时，“依照分立的双边协定在相当时间内保持美国基地。”美帝的这一个罪恶的阴谋，不但是严重地违背了波茨坦宣言的条款，甚至无异是向全亚洲的人民公开的挑战行为。因为，事情是很清楚的：美国帝国主义显然是企图以大规模地武装日本法西斯势力，来补充其已感不足的军事力量，和十分缺乏的人力。那就是说，美帝将大规模地重整日本军备，就是意味着美帝对亚洲和平更大的威胁。身受过第二次大战期间日寇所造成的深重灾难的亚洲各国人民，尤其是中国人民，是坚决反对美帝这个阴谋的。
    如所周知，美帝这种在亚洲扩大侵略的滔天罪行，并不是什么新的阴谋，而是在它占领日本五年来所一直执行着的罪恶政策的发展。五年来，美帝国主义在日本已经作了许多危害亚洲各国人民的措施。只要看看战犯问题，就可以全部了解美帝的态度了。美帝包庇了以裕仁为首的战犯集团，并自一九四六年六月起陆续释放了已经被捕的大批战争罪犯。其中包括了屠杀过中国人民的前中国派遣军总司令西尾寿造和冈村宁次，以及其他双手沾满了中国人民和东南亚其他各国人民鲜血的大大小小的刽子手。不仅如此，战贩麦克阿瑟更于今年三月七日公然宣布所谓“宣誓释放制度”，对已经被盟国军事法庭判处罪行的日本战犯，将全部加以分批释放。苏联政府曾于五月十一日和八月二十五日，两度照会美国政府，严厉指斥这种提前释放战争罪犯“指令”的非法，并要求立即撤消这种“指令”。中国人民完全赞成苏联政府的正义立场，因为这是符合于中国人民以及亚洲各国人民的共同利益的。美国政府的这种非法行为，不仅是违背了有关惩处日本战犯的国际协定，而且是公开向世界宣布自己与屠杀过亚洲各国人民的那些刽子手们的亲密的血缘关系。
    和日本战犯一道，日本的军事工业和军事基地，也都被美帝保留下来，用为向亚洲各国进行侵略的工具了。在侵略台湾的罪行中，美帝曾指使了战犯前日本华北派遣军司令根本博等，组织所谓“志愿军”以阻止我解放台湾；而在对朝鲜的侵略战争中，美帝的飞机、舰艇，大都是从日本的空、海军基地出发，向朝鲜人民进行攻击和轰炸的。同时，在麦克阿瑟的掩护下，日本的三百家飞机制造厂、一百七十家兵工厂及数百家其他有关军事企业如造船厂、炼钢厂、化学工厂等均已全部开工，大量为美帝制造和修理着各种武器。很明显，美帝占领下的日本，已经成为美帝在亚洲的一个侵略战争的基地和兵工厂了。美帝在日本及其对于亚洲国家的反动措施，是应当加以坚决打击，而且能够把它击败的。中国人民胜利的经验，证明了这一点，而且正在进行新的斗争。英勇的朝鲜人民正在给侵略者以沉重的打击，日本人民也正在广泛地展开反对美帝国主义的坚决的斗争；亚洲其他各国人民也正在日益觉悟，与日益团结。亚洲各国人民力量的结合，在与全世界和平阵营共同努力之下，一定可以赶走美帝国主义出亚洲以恢复亚洲的和平。
    我们应当坚决相信，打败过日本帝国主义的亚洲各国人民，在今天，是有把握打败日本的继承者美国帝国主义的疯狂侵略的。
