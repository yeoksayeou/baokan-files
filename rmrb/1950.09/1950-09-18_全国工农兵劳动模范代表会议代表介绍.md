Introductions to Representatives of the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Workers, and Soldiers

　　Li Xiujun, the Coal Saving Banner of Tangshan

　　Li Xiujun is a worker in the boiler room of the Tangshan Power Plant. He took the lead in studying combustion technology and accumulating coal-saving experience, continuously setting new records for coal consumption in chain boilers, directly reducing power generation costs, and making significant contributions to production and conservation. In February of this year, he was promoted from foreman to deputy director of the boiler field. During the Red May production and conservation emulation campaign in Tangshan, he was selected as a special-class labor hero of the factory and the entire city of Tangshan, and was awarded the honorary title of "Coal Saving Banner" of Tangshan.

　　Li Xiujun is thirty-eight years old this year and has lived a hard life. He has worked as an apprentice and woven cloth. Because he owed money to the landlord, he worked for the landlord from a young age. When he was twenty-one years old, he couldn't take it anymore and ran to the Shijingshan Power Plant in Beijing as an apprentice.

　　In the past, learning technology was very difficult. He swung a large hook for four years at the Shijingshan Power Plant and was injured several times before becoming a boiler fireman. During these four years, he paid attention everywhere and learned a technique. In 1941, he was transferred to the Tangshan Power Plant. During the period of Japanese寇 and Kuomintang rule, days of hunger and cold always weighed down Li Xiujun, and despite working hard, he could hardly get enough to eat.

　　Tangshan was liberated, and Li Xiujun, who had suffered for half his life, also got his chance to stand up. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Tangshan Power Plant immediately changed its appearance, soliciting workers' opinions everywhere, planning for the workers, and establishing spare-time schools to enable workers to learn. Li Xiujun gradually realized that the working class had become the masters of the country and had a clear understanding of the Communist Party. He often wondered how he could contribute his strength to his country and repay the Communist Party's kindness.

　　Last year, in the Red May, the power plant's trade union launched a production and conservation meritorious service campaign, and the boiler room workers first launched a coal-saving campaign. At that time, Li Xiujun had already served as the boiler operation foreman, and he led all the workers in the class to carefully study how to reduce coal consumption.

　　Last summer, after a rain, the workers said that the coal washed by the rain burned very well and was particularly saving. But at that time, it did not attract everyone's attention, but Li Xiujun, who was thinking day and night about how to reduce coal consumption, was inspired. After repeated research and experiments, it was proved that coal needs to have appropriate moisture to burn well. He put forward this issue to the workers for research, and got the unanimous agreement of the workers. As a result of the official trial, coal consumption dropped from 0.66 kg to 0.612 kg. Since then, it has aroused the workers' interest in studying coal consumption, and the boiler field classes, under the leadership of Li Xiujun, launched a coal-saving competition between classes, and the class led by Li Xiujun has always been at the forefront. At this time, Li Xiujun had become a glorious Communist Party member.

　　Under the cultivation and education of the Party, Li Xiujun worked more actively and harder, and he could also unite the workers. He often used his past difficulties in learning technology to encourage everyone to learn technology.

　　Years of continuous and humble learning have made Li Xiujun's experience more abundant, and he is very familiar with every part of the two boilers. Sometimes, due to the carelessness of the workers, the machine broke down, he would alertly run to the accident site, quickly repair it, and then he would point out the root cause of the fault and the treatment method to the workers, helping the workers to improve their technology.

　　In this year's Red May, the Tangshan Power Plant received an order from the Electricity Industry Administration Bureau, requiring the factory's night shift to implement the fire suppression method to cooperate with the dispatch of the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan power grid, and to save fuel. However, as a result of the implementation, it wasted coal instead, and the workers were in low spirits. He encouraged everyone on the one hand and thought of a way on the other. Finally, he came up with the idea of closing the main steam valve late during fire suppression and using the steam in the furnace. Therefore, he improved the fire suppression and shutdown technology, and created a new record of coal consumption of 0.577 kg. (Shi Lianshu)

　　Labor Mutual Aid Model Yang Xianting

　　Yang Xianting is from Minli Village, Beixing District, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province. In 1947, he took the lead in organizing a production mutual aid group. Because of his democratic style and his leadership in implementing the voluntary and mutually beneficial mutual aid policy, his group was very consolidated and played a promoting role in the production movement. This year, he led the group to use new agricultural tools, which not only expanded the cultivated area, but also exceeded last year's output.

　　This spring, Yang Xianting received a full set of Soviet-style new horse-drawn agricultural tools from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the Northeast People's Government, and the people's governments of the province and county also lent his mutual aid group five weeding machines. Can these "guys" grow more food well? People in the village and members of the group were skeptical and lacked confidence. Although Yang Xianting had never used new agricultural tools before, he had studied them when he attended a meeting at the Department of Agriculture and Forestry, so he was full of confidence. He said: "This thing is very easy to use. The foreign plough opens up the wasteland quickly."

　　When planting, the whole group used seeders to plant a total of 20 hectares and 3 mu of wheat. The seeds were disinfected with copper sulfate, more fertilizer was applied, and it rained thoroughly, so the seedlings emerged neatly. After hoeing and cultivating once, the wheat grew very strong. Each hectare of cultivated land yielded an average of more than three dan, and wasteland yielded more than two dan. When planting large fields, excellent varieties were selected and fertilizer was generally applied. One Soviet-style cultivator, two Fumin cultivators, and two United cultivators were used for hoeing and cultivating. Although two laborers were often sick during the hoeing and cultivating, and because of frequent meetings, the whole group was delayed for more than 200 workdays, it still exceeded the hoeing and cultivating plan. After hoeing and cultivating three times, the weather was very dry, and the dry soil was more than a foot deep. The old folks in other groups all hung up their hoes, but Yang Xianting still led the group to continue hoeing. He said to everyone: "We are using new agricultural tools, so we must set a good example for the old folks." At this time, they divided the work and cultivated the soil once again. The land planted by their mutual aid group was loose, the soil did not crack, and no wind entered, so the seedlings grew particularly well. By the time of wheat harvesting, all 16 hectares and 4 mu of soybeans in the group had been cultivated four times, except for one large weed. Corn and sorghum were cultivated five times, and millet was cultivated seven times.

　　Multiple cultivations not only resisted the drought, but also made the crops grow better than in previous years. The sorghum was full of red, and the ears were more than a foot long, yielding more than 7.5 dan per hectare (only 5 dan last year due to drought). The soybeans grew to waist height, and there were many pods under the leaves, with three grains in each pod (only two last year), yielding more than 5 dan per hectare (4 dan last year). The corn also grew very thick and solid, with two to three cobs per plant. Only individual plants had one cob, and the cobs were more than a foot and two inches long, yielding 7 dan per hectare (5 dan last year). The millet grew neatly, chest-high, and the ears were more than 7 inches long, estimated to yield at least 7 dan per hectare (5 dan last year). Seeing that their crops were growing full and confident of increasing production, the whole group publicized the effectiveness of the new agricultural tools and weeding machines everywhere, saying: "Our group has 14 and a half laborers and 15 horses, and we have planted more than 90 hectares of wasteland and cultivated land. If we didn't use new agricultural tools, how could we cultivate so many times?" Now they are more concerned about and cherish the new agricultural tools, and are preparing to add carts and buy horses to expand production next year.

　　全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议代表介绍
    唐山市省煤旗帜李秀俊
    李秀俊是唐山发电厂锅炉房工人。他带头钻研燃烧技术，积累省煤经验，连续创造链条式锅炉煤耗的新纪录，直接降低了发电成本，对生产节约有重大贡献。今年二月他由领班提升为锅炉场副主任。唐山市红五月生产节约创模竞赛运动中，被选为该厂及全唐山市的特等劳动英雄，获得唐山市“省煤旗帜”的荣誉称号。
    李秀俊今年三十八岁了，一生过的是苦日子，当过学徒，织过布。因欠地主的债，从小就替地主干活。到二十一岁那年，他再也受不下去了，便跑到北京石景山发电厂当学徒。
    过去学技术是非常不容易的。他在石景山发电厂抡了四年大钩子，受过几次伤，才当上一名锅炉看火的工人。在这四年中，他处处留心，学会了一门技术。一九四一年他被调到唐山发电厂。在日寇和国民党统治时期，饥寒交迫的日子始终压得李秀俊松不过气来，虽然拚命苦干，终难得温饱。
    唐山解放了，半辈子受苦的李秀俊也得到了出头的日子。在共产党和人民政府的领导下，唐山发电厂立刻变了样，处处征求工人意见，为工人打算，并且成立了业余学校，使工人们学习。李秀俊逐渐体会到工人阶级已成为国家的主人，对共产党有了清楚的认识。他常常在想，怎样才能把自己的力量贡献给自己的国家，报答共产党的恩情？
    去年红五月中，电厂工会发起生产节约立功运动，锅炉房工友们首先展开省煤运动。那时李秀俊已经担任了锅炉运行领班，他便带动了全班工友，精心研究如何降低煤耗。
    去年夏季雨后，工友们都说经过雨浇的煤很好烧，特别省。但是当时还没有引起大家的注意，正在日夜捉摸怎样降低煤耗的李秀俊却得到了启示。以后又经过了反复的研究试验，证明煤里需要有适当的水份才好烧。他就把这个问题提出和工友们研究，得到工友们一致同意，正式试行结果，煤耗由○·六六公斤降到○·六一二公斤。从此更引起了工友们研究煤耗的兴趣，锅炉场各班在李秀俊带动下，掀起了班与班之间的省煤竞赛，而李秀俊所领导的一班却始终走在前面。这时李秀俊已成为光荣的共产党员。
    李秀俊在党的培养与教育下，工作更加积极努力，也能团结工友们，他经常以自己过去学技术的困难来鼓励大家学习技术。
    长年不断地虚心学习，使李秀俊的经验更加丰富起来，他把两座锅炉的每一零件都非常熟悉。有时因工友们不小心，机器出了毛病，他便机警地跑到出事故的地点，敏捷地修理好，然后他便给工友们指出毛病的根源和处理的方法，帮助工友们提高技术。
    今年红五月中，唐山发电厂接到电业总局的命令，要该厂夜班实行压火法，以配合京、津、唐电力网的调度，且可节省燃料。但实行结果，反到费了煤，工友们情绪不高。他便一面鼓励大家，一面想办法，终于想出在压火时晚关主汽门，利用炉内的蒸气。因此改进了压火停炉技术，创造了耗煤○·五七七公斤的新纪录。（史连枢）
    劳动互助模范杨显亭
    杨显亭是黑龙江克山县北兴区民立村人，他在一九四七年带头组织了一个生产互助组。由于他的作风民主，领导全组认真贯彻了自愿两利的互助方针，因而他的小组十分巩固，并在生产运动中起了推动作用。今年他又领导全组使用了新式农具，不但扩大了耕地面积，并超过了去年产量。
    今年春季，杨显亭从东北人民政府农林部领回了全套的苏联新式马拉农具，省和县的人民政府也贷给他的互助组五台锄草机。这些“家伙”能不能把地种好多打粮食呢？屯里的人和组内的人都半信半疑，缺乏信心。虽然杨显亭过去没使过新式农具，但他在农林部开会时曾作了研究，所以他满有信心。他说：“这玩艺很好使，洋犁开起荒来就虎虎的（快的意思）。”
    种地时，全组使用了播种机，共种小麦二十垧另三亩。种籽经过王铜消毒，多上了肥料，又赶上透雨，所以苗出的很齐。以后铲趟了一遍，小麦长的十分肥壮，每垧熟地平均打了三石多，荒地也在两石以上。种大田时都选的优良品种，并普遍施了肥料，铲趟使用苏联中耕锄草机一台、福民号锄草机两台，联合号两台，虽然有两个劳动力在铲趟当中常有病，又因为常开会，全组耽误了二百多个工，但还超过了铲趟计划。在铲趟完三遍后，天旱的很厉害，干土有一尺多深，别的组老乡都挂锄了，杨显亭还领导小组继续铲，他跟大伙说：“咱们使的是新农具，一定要给老乡们作个好样子看。”这时他们又分好工，铲趟了一遍。他们互助组种的地，土松地不裂缝，也不进风去，苗长的分外好。到割小麦，全组十六垧四亩大豆都铲趟了四遍，除一遍大草。苞米、高粱铲趟了五遍，谷子、糜子作到了七铲七趟。
    铲趟遍数多，不但抗了旱灾，而庄稼比往年长得更好。高粱满地红，穗子长有一尺多长，每垧能打七石五斗多（去年天旱才打五石）。大豆长到腰深，豆叶下面的豆荚很多，一个荚结到三个粒（去年只结两个），每垧能打五石多（去年打四石）。苞米长的也很粗实，每棵结两个棒到三个棒，长一个棒的仅是个别株，棒子长的有一尺二寸，每垧能打七石（去年打五石）。谷子长的整齐，高及胸部，谷穗有七寸多长，估计每垧顶少能打七石（去年打五石）。全组看到自己庄稼长的丰满，增产信心更大，到处宣传新农具和锄草机的效果说：“我们组十四个半劳动力，十五匹马，连开荒带熟地种了九十多垧，要不是使用新农具，那能多铲多趟遍数。”现在他们对新农具更加关心和爱护，并准备添车买马，扩大明年的生产。
