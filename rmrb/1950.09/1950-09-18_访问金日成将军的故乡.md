　　Visiting General Kim Il-sung's Hometown
　　By Our Special Correspondent Li Zhuang

　　About twenty miles southwest of Pyongyang lies General Kim Il-sung's hometown, Mangyongdae. Like many Korean villages, it is peaceful and beautiful. However, during this tense patriotic war for unification, the village is filled with a tense atmosphere of battle: enthusiastically supporting the front lines, and cautiously dealing with enemy air raids. This is exactly the same as in all Korean villages.

　　Mangyongdae is a small village of ninety-two households, scattered sparsely in a small valley. The village is surrounded by mountains covered with various kinds of trees. There are several large apple orchards on the hillside. The apples are ripening, with green leaves and red fruit, making them beautiful and moving. On the highest hilltop in the east of the village, there is a stone beacon tower. The farmers say that this tower was built during the Joseon Dynasty. Below the tower is a cliff where the Taedong River and the Potong River converge. The water and mountain scenery are magnificent, hence the name Mangyongdae (meaning "ten thousand views terrace"). At the entrance to the village stand four large buildings, two of which are revolutionary cadre schools and two are revolutionary martyrs' bereaved family academies, all new buildings constructed after August 15th. In the center of the village are two tiled houses, which are the village's national elementary school. General Kim Il-sung studied here in his youth. At noon, the elementary school students were taking off their clothes and digging air-raid shelters under the leadership of their teacher, sweating profusely. The day before our visit to Mangyongdae, a small village across a hillside from Mangyongdae was attacked by American planes. Two farmers were killed, one was an old man herding cattle on the hillside, and the other was an old woman weeding in the rice field. At this time, the elementary school students were cursing the Americans while working hard.

　　General Kim Il-sung's family lives deep in the village. Two cement bungalows, surrounded by a wooden fence. Eggplants, tobacco, and onions are planted in the yard, and ducks and geese run all over the place. Here we met General Kim Il-sung's eighty-year-old grandfather, seventy-five-year-old grandmother, his third uncle and aunt, and his nephews and nieces.

　　This is a revolutionary family. This family represents the revolutionary struggle of the Korean nation for the past half-century. General Kim Il-sung's father, Kim Hyong-jik, was a village teacher, a famous patriot and revolutionary. He was arrested by the Japanese police for carrying out underground revolutionary struggles and spent twelve years in prison. He died shortly after his release. On his deathbed, he called the young General Kim Il-sung and General Kim's second uncle, Hyong-kwon, to his side and said to them: "I can't do anything anymore. For the independence and freedom of Korea, you must continue the revolution and strive hard." He told his brother and son that there were two guns buried underground that could be taken out as weapons. Kim Hyong-kwon continued Kim Hyong-jik's revolutionary cause. He killed the criminal director of the Japanese occupiers in Hamhung, was arrested by the Japanese invaders, and died in Seoul. General Kim Il-sung continued the legacy of his father and second uncle, and even more advanced on the revolutionary path of a communist. He ran to the Northeast, led the local Korean immigrants, and launched a difficult anti-Japanese guerrilla war. After twenty years of struggle, he finally coordinated with the strength of the Soviet Red Army to overthrow the Japanese imperialist rule over Korea.

　　The seventy-five-year-old grandmother told me the story of her being forced to go to the Northeast to find Kim Il-sung. Thirteen years ago, she and her third son, Hyong-rok, lived in Mangyongdae, suffering from the close surveillance of the Japanese invaders. One day, two national traitors came with a lot of money and forced Hyong-rok to go to the Northeast to find his nephew. Hyong-rok said: "I can't find him. If you have the ability, go find him yourselves!" "At that time, we couldn't overpower the Japanese," the grandmother said. "I had to go with them. When we arrived in the Northeast, the Japanese killed cattle and horses, thinking they could find Kim Il-sung. When we got near Kim Il-sung's guerrilla area, they asked a teenager to go with me. I said: What does a child know? You have knives and guns, you should go with me. If Kim Il-sung doesn't come, wouldn't you fight?!" The old woman looked for him twice, once in Fusong and the second time in Antu, of course, she didn't find him. However, the long journey of nine months made her catch a cold on the road, and now she often has back pain and "can't work well."

　　The old grandfather missed General Kim very much. He said, "Since the war started, Kim Il-sung hasn't been home yet. He must be extremely busy. When the Americans are driven away, he will come to see us." He said, "The Americans look down on us. They originally said: On the first day of the war, we'll have breakfast in Kaesong, lunch in Pyongyang, and dinner in Wonsan. Now let them see! We defeated the Japanese. The Americans are even more hateful than the Japanese. We must defeat them."

　　In the middle of our conversation, the chairman of the ri People's Committee (village chief) came to give the old man money to buy copper bowls. Because at this time, the Korean government was mobilizing the people to donate copperware, and the state was purchasing it with money. General Kim's aunt donated the copper bowl she brought when she got married to the state, and also donated some other bronzes. According to Korean customs, women must bring a large copper bowl when they get married. This batch of copperware is very large in number nationwide. During World War II, the Japanese invaders ordered Korean farmers to hand over all their copper bowls, but the women secretly buried them. Now, they voluntarily take out the copper bowls and donate them to their country.

　　General Kim's family grows more than 3,000 pyong of land. This land originally belonged to the landlords, and it was distributed to them during the land reform. Hyong-rok is a well-known hardworking farmer. Before August 15th, in addition to renting these lands, he constantly worked short-term jobs for others. Now, Hyong-rok's eldest son works in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and his eldest daughter has joined the People's Army and is fighting at the front. The remaining six people rely on this land to grow food, grow cotton and linen for clothing, and raise pigs and ducks to provide for their children's tuition. Although life is hard, they don't worry about food and clothing.

　　The eighty-year-old grandfather is very healthy. He has worked hard all his life and still works all day long. During my day-long visit to Mangyongdae, I saw him cleaning the yard in the morning, weeding in the tobacco field in the morning, cutting hay on the mountain in the afternoon, and carrying back a full wooden frame in the evening. In 1948, North and South Korean political parties held a joint conference in Pyongyang. After the meeting, Kim Gu visited Mangyongdae. He saw General Kim's grandfather twisting straw ropes and felt very strange, and asked, "You old man has a good grandson, why are you still working by yourself?" The old grandfather said, "My grandson is a good grandson. He has done good things for the country, not for me to enjoy alone. If I can work, I want to support myself."

　　The current Mangyongdae is a wealthy village. In five years, this village has completely changed. Before August 15th, there were only four middle-class farmers in Mangyongdae, and the rest were poor farmers and tenant farmers. The Japanese and Korean landlords plundered 70% of the land in the village. They lived in Pyongyang and sent people to the village to collect high rents during the harvest season. The village chief and the village party secretary calculated in detail: Before August 15th, the villagers paid about 4,200 bags of rent grain to the landlords every year (two-thirds of which were rice and one-third were miscellaneous grains. Each bag was four dou, and each dou was equivalent to 24 jin in our country), and the Japanese invaders plundered about 3,000 bags in the form of rent and taxes, a total of more than 7,000 bags. "How much grain could be harvested every year before liberation?" Village chief Cha Guihuan said: Last year, in 1949, Mangyongdae harvested 9,386 bags of grain. Before August 15th, it was absolutely impossible to harvest this amount. Much of the land was barren. He said: In the past, we planted less land and suffered less beatings. If you plant more, they want more. If you can't afford it, they will beat you. Many people lost their land and went to Pyongyang to sell their labor or to the Taedong River to fish. Several other farmers said: "However much rice we planted, there wasn't a grain of rice in our bowls. The whole village couldn't save two thousand bags of grain a year, and everyone exchanged it for bean cakes to eat."

　　After the land reform, the situation was completely different. Rent grain was completely abolished, and taxes were greatly reduced. The people's lives improved day by day. Last year, the whole village harvested more than 9,300 bags of grain, paid 1,600 bags of grain in kind taxes to the state, and there were no other burdens. I visited four or five farm households and found that their actual income had increased by about three times compared to before August 15th. Although it is now autumn harvest, every household still has surplus grain from last year.

　　As the economic life of farmers improves, their cultural life also rises. This small village of more than ninety households now has twelve radios, four record players, and thirty-two sewing machines, all purchased by the farmers themselves. Before August 15th, there was not a single middle school student in Mangyongdae, but now there are more than thirty. There are a total of 250 students in the national elementary school, which means that all school-age children in the village are enrolled. Another particularly noteworthy thing is that no farmer under the age of sixty in Mangyongdae is now illiterate. From 1946 to 1949, every farmer attended adult school and graduated from adult school. Adult schools are divided into two types: elementary school classes only learn cultural courses, and middle school classes learn both cultural and political courses. Adult schools are held during the winter slack season, with two or three hours of study per day.

　　The farmers of Mangyongdae, like more than 20 million farmers in Korea, firmly demand that the American aggressors be driven away as soon as possible. They all know that "the Americans are the same as the Japanese. If they come, our good life will be gone." Therefore, they do everything possible to support the front lines. More than sixty young people from this small village of 540 people have joined the People's Army; this year's burden is heavier than last year. For example, in addition to paying in-kind taxes, farmers have also bought many public bonds and donated money to buy tanks and airplanes. However, they voluntarily bear these burdens. After many young people left to fight, the work of the elderly has increased. When it was completely dark, I saw them still harvesting and mowing grass in the fields... This year, Mangyongdae did not abandon a single pyong of land. During this tense war period, the farmers still strived for a ten-percent harvest this year. The farmers of Mangyongdae Village hope to change their houses. Korean farmers originally lived in houses with wooden walls and thatched roofs, which were low and simple. This is the result of long-term oppression and exploitation. This situation cannot be changed universally in a short period of time. The farmers of Mangyongdae use two methods to solve this problem: one is to cultivate intensively and strive to produce more grain from the land; the other is to develop sideline occupations and use sideline occupations to accumulate capital in order to build new houses. Now, Mangyongdae has an average of one cow for every three households, and an average of one pig and five chickens per household. Before August 15th, there were only six cows in the whole village, and no household could raise pigs. Some particularly hardworking farmers have already started to change their houses. They demolished the thatched houses and built forty-eight tiled houses. They said to me: "After the Americans are driven away, it won't be long before all these rotten houses of ours will be replaced with new ones." Indeed, they are full of confidence in victory. They understand very clearly how they should live their lives. They are fighting for their own happy lives. There is no doubt that their wishes will be realized in the near future.

　　访问金日成将军的故乡
    本报特派记者  李庄
    平壤西南二十余里，即金日成将军的故乡——万景台。它和许多朝鲜的农村一样，恬静而且美丽。但是，在这紧张的爱国统一战争时期，这一村庄已充溢了紧张的战斗的空气：热烈地支援前线，谨慎地对付敌机的袭击。这是和全朝鲜的农村完全相同的。
    万景台是个九十二户人家的小村庄，疏疏落落地散布在一个小小的谷地中。村周群山环绕，山上长满各种各样的林木。山坡上有几片很大的苹果园，苹果已到成熟季节，绿叶红果，美丽动人。在村东最高的山头上，筑有一个石质的烽火台，农民们说：此台是李朝建造的。台下悬崖，为大同江与普通江合流处，水光山影，气象万千，万景台即因此得名。进村处，矗立着四幢大楼，两幢为革命干部学校，两幢为革命烈士遗族学院，都是“八一五”后的新建筑。村中央有两所瓦房，是村里的国民小学校，金日成将军少年时代，曾在这里读书。中午时，小学生们正脱掉衣服，在教师领导下，汗流满面地挖掘防空壕。在我们访问万景台的前一天，和万景台隔着一个山坡的另一小村，遭受了美国飞机的袭击。牺牲了两个农民，一个是在山坡上放牛的老汉，一个在稻田中拔草的老妇人。这时候，小学生们一面咒骂美国人，一面紧张地工作着。
    金日成将军的家庭在村的深处。两所洋灰平房，外面围着用木板作成的院墙。院子里种着茄子、烟叶和葱，鸭子和鹅满地跑着。我们在这里会见了金日成将军八十岁的祖父、七十五岁的祖母，他的三叔三婶和侄儿侄女。
    这是一个革命家庭。这个家庭代表着朝鲜民族半世纪以来革命斗争的经历。金日成将军的父亲名叫金亨稷，是个乡村教师，著名的爱国者和革命家。他由于进行地下革命斗争，被日本警察逮捕，住了十二年监狱。出狱不久就逝世了。临终时，他把少年的金日成将军和金将军的二叔亨全叫到跟前，对他们说：“我现在是不能再作什么了。你们为了朝鲜的独立和自由，要继续革命，努力斗争。”他告诉弟弟和儿子说，地下埋着两支手枪，可以拿出来作武器。金亨全继续金亨稷的革命事业，他在咸兴打死了日本占领者的刑事部长，被日寇逮捕，在汉城牺牲了。金日成将军继续了他父亲和二叔的遗志，并且更前进走上了共产主义者的革命道路，他跑到东北，领导当地的朝鲜移民，开展了艰苦的抗日游击战争，奋斗二十年，终于配合了苏联红军的力量，打倒了日本帝国主义对朝鲜的统治。
    七十五岁的老祖母对我叙述她被迫到东北寻觅金日成的故事。十三年前，她和自己的第三个儿子亨录住在万景台，遭受着日寇严密的监视。有一天，来了两个民族叛徒，带着许多钱，强迫亨录到东北找他的侄子。亨录说：“我找不到他，你们有本事自己去找吧！”“在那种时候，我们强不过日本人，”老祖母说：“我只得跟着他们去了。到了东北，日本人杀牛宰马，以为可以找到金日成了。到了金日成的游击区附近，他们叫一个十几岁的孩子同我一起去。我说：他一个孩子懂得什么？你们有刀有枪，应当和我一起去。金日成如果不来，你们不是会打仗么？！”老人家找了两次，第一次在抚松，第二次在安图，当然都没有找到。但是，九个月的长途跋涉，使她在路上受了风寒，现在时常腰痛，“不能好好地作事。”
    老祖父很想念金将军，他说：“自从打起仗来，金日成还没有回过家，他一定忙极了。等到把美国人赶跑了，他会来看我们的。”他说：“美国人看不起我们。他们原来说：战争开始的第一天，在开城吃早饭，在平壤吃午饭，到元山吃晚饭。现在让他们看看吧！我们打败了日本人，美国人比日本人更可恶，我们一定要打败它。”
    我们谈话中间，里人民委员会委员长（村长）给老人家送买铜碗的钱来了。因为，这时候，朝鲜政府正发动人民献纳铜器，由国家出钱收购。金将军的婶婶把出嫁时带来的铜碗献给国家，还献出一些其他的铜器。朝鲜风俗，妇女出嫁时都要陪送一个大铜碗，这批铜器在全国说来，为数甚多。第二次世界大战时，日寇曾勒令朝鲜农民缴出全部铜碗，但是，妇女们都悄悄地埋藏起来了。现在，她们自愿地把铜碗拿出来，献给自己的国家。
    金将军家里种着三千多坪土地。这些土地原是地主的，在土地改革时分给他们了。亨录是个有名的勤苦农民，“八一五”前，他除了租种这些土地以外，还不断给人家打短工。现在，亨录的大儿子在内务省工作，大女儿参加了人民军，在前方作战。剩下六口人，靠着这些土地，种粮食吃饭，种棉麻穿衣，养猪养鸭供给子女的学费，生活虽然清苦，但是不愁衣食。
    八十岁的老祖父，身体非常健康。他辛勤一生，到老还是终日劳作。我在万景台访问一天，看见他早晨收拾院子，上午在烟田里锄草，下午到山上割牧草，傍晚，背回满满的一木架子。一九四八年，南北朝鲜各政党在平壤开联席会议。会议完了。金九曾经访问万景台。他看见金将军的祖父搓草绳，觉得非常奇怪，问道：“你老人家有了个好孙子，为什么还自己干活呢？”老祖父说：“孙子是个好孙子，他给国家办了好事，并非为了叫我一人享福。我能劳动，我要自食其力。”
    现在的万景台是个富裕的村庄。五年的工夫，这个村庄完全变了样子。“八一五”前，万景台只有四户中农，其余都是贫农和雇农。日本人和朝鲜地主掠夺了全村百分之七十的土地，他们住在平壤，到收获季节，派人来村里收取高额的地租。村长和村党部书记详细地算了一笔账：在“八一五”前，全村农民每年缴给地主的租粮约四千二百包（其中稻子占三分之二，杂粮占三分之一。每包四斗，每斗合我国二十四斤），被日寇以租税形式掠夺去的约三千多包，共计七千多包。“解放以前，每年能够收获多少粮食呢？”村长车桂焕说：去年，一九四九年，万景台收了九千三百八十六包粮食。而在八一五以前，是绝对收不到这个数目的。许多土地都荒了。他说：我们在过去是少种一些地，少挨一些打。你种的多，他要的更多，你出不起，他就打你。许多人丢了土地，到平壤卖苦力，到大同江打鱼。另外几个农民说：“我们种了多少稻子，我们的饭碗里没有一粒大米。全村一年剩不了两千包粮食，大家都换成豆饼吃了。”
    土地改革以后，情形完全不同了。租粮完全取消，捐税大为减少。人民生活日渐改善。去年全村收粮九千三百多包，向国家缴纳了一千六百包粮食的现物税，就再没有其他负担了。我访问了四、五户农家，发现他们的实际收入，都比“八一五”前增加了三倍左右。目前虽然已届秋收，家家户户还有去年的余粮。
    农民的经济生活日有改善，文化生活也随之上涨。这个九十多户人家的小村庄，现有十二个收音机，四个留声机，三十二个缝纫机，都是农民自己购买的。“八一五”前，万景台没有一个中学生，现在有了三十多个。国民小学校中共有二百五十个学生，就是说，全村的学龄儿童都入学了。还有一件特别值得提出的事情，即：万景台全村六十岁以下的农民，现已没有一个文盲了。从一九四六年到一九四九年，每个农民都进过成人学校，都在成人学校毕业了。成人学校分两种，小学班只学文化课，中学班兼学文化和政治。成人学校利用冬闲时间举办，每天学习两三小时。
    万景台的农民和朝鲜两千多万农民一样，坚决要求及早赶走美国侵略者。他们都晓得，“美国人和日本人一样，他们来了，我们的好生活就走了。”因此，他们不顾一切，尽全力支援前线。这个五百四十口人的小村庄，有六十多个青年参加了人民军；今年的负担比去年重一些，例如，除了缴纳现物税以外，农民们还买了许多公债，并捐款购买坦克和飞机。但是，这些负担他们是自愿地承受下来了。许多青年出征后，老年人的工作是加重了。在天已完全昏黑的时候，我看到他们还在田里收割、刈草……今年万景台没有荒了一坪土地，在这紧张的战争时期，农民们今年还争取了一个十成的丰收。万景台村的农民很希望能换一换房子。朝鲜农民原来住的都是木墙草顶的房屋，低矮而且简陋。这是长期被压迫被剥削的结果。这种情形不是短时期内能够普遍改变的。万景台的农民用两种方法来解决这个问题，一是精耕细作，争取地里多打粮食；一是发展副业，用副业积累资本，以便盖新房子。现在，万景台平均三户有一头牛，每户平均有一口猪、五只鸡。而在“八一五”前，全村只有六头牛，没有一户能够养猪。有些特别勤劳的农民已经开始换房子了，他们拆掉草房，盖起四十八间瓦屋。他们对我说：“赶走了美国人，不要多久，我们这些烂房子都要换成新的了。”真的，他们充满了胜利的信心，他们十分清楚地懂得应该怎样过生活，他们为了自己的幸福生活而斗争，毫无疑问，他们的愿望，在不久的将来，一定会实现的。
