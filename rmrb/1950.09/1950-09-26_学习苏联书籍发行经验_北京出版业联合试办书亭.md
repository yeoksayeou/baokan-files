　　Learning from the Soviet Union's Book Distribution Experience
    Beijing Publishing Industry Jointly Trials Book Kiosks
    Concurrently with the convening of the National Publishing Conference, the conference's preparatory committee held a publishing industry exhibition. As part of the exhibition, book kiosks were also set up. Twenty-five publishing and distribution companies in Beijing jointly prepared ten book kiosks, which appeared in Beihai and Zhongshan Parks.
    The establishment of book kiosks at the exhibition is to learn from the Soviet experience and prepare for a demonstration in China. This distribution method is a new form of launching a reading campaign, extending the distribution network widely and meticulously into the masses, and enabling the publishing industry to better serve the people.
    Soviet experience has proven that establishing book kiosks is one of the effective distribution methods for widely promoting publications. National distribution agencies have widely established book kiosks in factories, government offices, schools, tractor stations, collective farms, and on the boulevards and squares of Moscow. Because the installation of book kiosks is lightweight and requires few management personnel, a book kiosk can operate in one place for a few days and then be moved to another place. Book kiosks are also set up at various railway stations along highways and railways, so that passengers can conveniently buy the books they need during their travels.
    Vice Minister Ye Shengtao said in his opening speech at the First National Publishing Conference: "Putting the focus of distribution work on the reading movement, we must try every means to make those who do not read, read; those who read less, read more! And those who read, read well." Setting up book kiosks is one of those methods.
    The main task of book distribution is to find ways to deliver books and periodicals to places close to the working people, and even into their hands. We can, based on the Soviet experience, consider setting up book kiosks in major enterprises, factories, schools, stations, and other appropriate places to accomplish this task. In particular, because our country has long been under imperialist aggression, feudal forces, and the reactionary rule of bureaucratic capital, the broad masses of people have lost the opportunity to receive education due to poverty, resulting in a large number of illiterate people. Now that the Chinese people have overthrown the reactionary rule and become their own masters, their thirst for culture is very urgent. They have turned themselves over politically, but they still need to turn themselves over culturally. Therefore, launching a reading campaign and raising the cultural level of the broad masses of people is one of the urgent tasks to be completed, especially the literacy campaign that will be launched in 1951. After the reading campaign and the literacy campaign are launched, mass reading organizations such as reading groups and reading clubs will be widely established, and book kiosks will inevitably become a bridge between reading groups, readers, and publishers.
    This demonstration book kiosk in Beijing has a total of ten. Eight are in Beihai, and two are in Zhongshan Park. The twenty-five public and private bookstores in the city participating in the establishment of book kiosks include Xinhua, International, Sanlian, Youth, Worker, Lianyin, Kaiming, and Commercial Press. The distribution adopts a meticulous division of labor, with each book kiosk only selling one or two or three types of books. The installation of the book kiosks is lightweight and simple, and the layout is artistic and beautiful. Books are sold at a 10% discount, and bookmarks, postcards and other souvenirs are distributed.
    The first book kiosk faces workers, peasants, and soldiers and is sponsored by the Worker Publishing House. It displays more than 300 kinds of reading materials on production and construction, and popular literature and art. In front of the kiosk, a couplet written in red cloth by Comrade Zhao Shuli reads: "Do everything possible to serve the masses, please criticize where it is not enough." The second book kiosk is for science and technology publications, collecting more than 500 kinds of science and technology reading materials published in various regions and before liberation. The third book kiosk displays more than 400 kinds of literature and art books, including the masterpieces of Chinese and foreign writers such as Gorky and Lu Xun. The fourth book kiosk displays books on social sciences. The fifth book kiosk is for youth, women, and children's reading materials. In order to publicize opposition to aggression and defense of peace, the sixth book kiosk displays all related photos, magazines, and various propaganda pictures. In addition to the statue of Chairman Mao, portraits of people's leaders from eighteen countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and North Korea, are hung high in the kiosk. A peace signature book is also placed at the entrance of the book kiosk for readers to sign. The eighth book kiosk in Beihai and the ninth and tenth book kiosks in Zhongshan Park specialize in selling the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao.
    This demonstration has initially received a warm welcome from readers. At the same time, the division of labor in selling books in these ten book kiosks will also open up a new path of specialized division of labor for the distribution work of New China.

### 学习苏联书籍发行经验  北京出版业联合试办书亭

　　学习苏联书籍发行经验
    北京出版业联合试办书亭
    与全国出版会议召开的同时，该会筹委会举办了一个出版事业展览会。在展览会的组成部分中还另设有书亭。由京市出版发行同业二十五家共同筹备了十个书亭，分别在北海、中山两公园内出现。
    展览会设立书亭，是为了吸取苏联的经验，预备在中国作一次示范。这种发行方式是展开读书运动，把发行网广泛、细密的深入到群众中去，使出版事业更好为人民服务的一种新形式。
    苏联的经验证明，设立书亭是广泛推行出版物的有效的发行方式之一。国家发行机构在各工厂、机关、学校、拖拉机站、集体农场等场所，以及莫斯科的林荫大道和广场都普遍设立了书亭。由于书亭的装置轻便，管理人员很少，有时一个书亭在一个地方营业了几天，就可转移到别的地方去。公路上和铁路沿线的各火车站也设有书亭，旅客在旅途中可以很方便地买到他所需要的书籍。
    叶圣陶副署长在第一届全国出版会议开幕词中说：“把发行工作的重心放在读书运动上，想尽种种办法，让不读书的读书，少读书的多读书！读了书的善于读书。”设立书亭，正是其中的一种办法。
    书籍发行的主要任务是要想法把书刊送到接近劳动人民的地方，甚至送到他们的手里。我们可以根据苏联的经验，在各大企业、工厂、学校、车站以及其它适当的地方，考虑设置书亭，来完成这一任务。特别是我国由于长期处于帝国主义侵略，封建势力和官僚资本反动统治之下，广大的人民因贫困而失去了受教育的机会，造成了文盲众多的现象。在中国人民已经打垮了反动统治，自己作了主人的今日，他们对文化的渴求是十分迫切的。他们在政治上是翻身了，但还要在文化上翻身。因此展开读书运动，提高广大人民的文化水平是目前急需完成的任务之一，特别是一九五一年即将展开的扫除文盲运动。在读书运动和扫盲运动展开以后，像读书会、读书俱乐部的群众性的读书组织，必将广泛地设立起来，书亭就必然成为读书会，读者和出版者之间的一座桥梁。
    这次在北京办的示范书亭共有十个。八个在北海，两个设在中山公园。参加设立书亭的有新华、国际、三联、青年、工人、联营、开明、商务等本市二十五家公私营书店。发行采取了细密的分工方式，每一书亭，只售一类或两三类图书。书亭装设轻便、简单，布置艺术、美观。书籍售价九折优待，并分赠书签、画片等纪念品。
    第一书亭面向工农兵，由工人出版社主办。陈列有生产建设、通俗文艺等读物三百余种；亭前用红布写着赵树理同志的一副对联：“尽其所能愿为群众服务，那里不够还请大家批评。”第二书亭是科学技术方面的出版物，网罗了各地区以及解放前所出版的各种科学技术读物五百多种。第三书亭陈列了文学艺术书籍四百多种，其中包括高尔基、鲁迅等中外作家的巨著。第四书亭陈列的是社会科学方面的书籍。第五书亭是青年、妇女、儿童读物。为了宣传反对侵略，保卫和平，第六书亭陈列的完全是有关这方面的照片、杂志和各种宣传图画。除了毛主席雕塑像外，亭内高悬着中、苏、朝鲜等十八个国家人民领袖像，书亭门口还摆着和平签名书，让读者签名。在北海的第八书亭和在中山公园的第九、十两书亭专售马、恩、列、斯和毛主席的著作。
    这一次的示范，已初步获得读者热烈的欢迎。同时由于这十个书亭售书的分工，亦将为新中国的发行工作开辟了一条分工专业化的新途径。
