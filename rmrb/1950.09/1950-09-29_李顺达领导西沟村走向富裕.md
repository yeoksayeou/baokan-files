Li Shunda Leads Xigou Village Towards Prosperity

I. The Communist Party Brings Happiness

Speaking of Ping Shun County, those familiar with the Taihang Mountains will know that this is a place lacking all five elements: metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. It is mountainous with many stones and infertile land. Xigou is a remote natural village in the county.

The Communist Party brought happiness to this poor mountain village. In just a few years, Xigou Village has undergone tremendous changes: before the War of Resistance, the whole village had 171 mu of cultivated land, of which 114 mu were rented from landlords in other villages. Now, after rent reduction and interest rate reduction, land reform, and the Great Production Movement, the villagers own 224 mu of cultivated land, and the average yield per mu has increased from 1.2 shi in 1943 to 2.1 shi. Livestock has also greatly prospered. In 1943, the whole village had five sheep and fifteen head of livestock; now, this small village of twenty-three households has 127 sheep and forty-three head of livestock. This place used to be a place where people only ate "chaff and vegetables for half the year," and the staple food of the farmers was "chaff cakes." Now, the farmers of Xigou Village eat pure grain three times a day. They have moved into newly built houses, and everyone has bedding and can change clothes three times a year (single, lined, and cotton-padded)... The farmer Cai Ronghe said it well: "Our belongings in the past could be carried away with one load, but now we won't sell it even for a hundred loads of millet."

This is a microcosm of the new socialist countryside after the land reform. The process of this new countryside changing from poor to rich is inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party and the leadership of the village's labor hero, Li Shunda.

Li Shunda was originally from Lin County, Henan Province. Eighteen years ago, he fled the famine to Xigou Village. At that time, his family of five had nothing, living in three dilapidated cave dwellings and renting 12.7 mu of land from landlords. After the establishment of the People's Government, he was loved and supported by the villagers because he led the whole village to organize and change from poor to rich. In the autumn of 1944, he was elected as a first-class labor hero of Ping Shun County. In the same year, he was elected as a first-class labor hero of the Taihang Liberated Area at the First Labor Hero Conference of the Taihang Liberated Area and at the Second Labor Hero Conference of Taihang in 1946. Now he is the secretary of the Communist Party branch of Xigou Administrative Village.

II. The Road from Poor Village to Rich Village

How did Li Shunda lead Xigou Village from poverty to prosperity?

Organize and overcome difficulties. In 1942, Ping Shun suffered a drought. In addition, the war was going on, the work was heavy, and there was a lack of labor and livestock, and the people's production and life were very difficult. According to the people's demands at that time to overcome difficulties and persist in production, Shunda actively responded to the Party's call to "organize to produce for self-salvation." In the spring of 1943, with Party members as the core, he first organized a mutual aid group of six people, reclaimed more than seven mu of wasteland in eight days, and accumulated more than 18,000 jin of firewood, which inspired the masses' confidence in production for self-salvation and enthusiasm for mutual aid. The mutual aid group quickly developed to sixteen households and was divided into three groups, and Li Shunda was elected as the captain. Then the mutual aid group launched mutual lending and mutual assistance, solved the difficulties of the group who had no food to eat, and reclaimed more than 120 mu of wasteland in one go. After the autumn harvest, they collected more than 1,000 bags of yams and the whole village survived the famine of that year. In 1944, all the reclaimed wasteland was planted with millet, and more than 120 shi of millet were harvested in the autumn. Li Shunda's family alone harvested 49 large shi of grain from 19 mu of land, and production initially took root.

In a small village of only twenty households, eight people joined the army or went out to work. From 1944 to 1945, the war service tasks were very heavy. In addition, a large number of civilians were mobilized to catch locusts, and the labor and livestock felt insufficient. Li Shunda led the whole village to organize, accurately calculate, and formulate a fifteen-day plan for fertilizing, harrowing, plowing, and sowing, absorbing semi- and auxiliary labor, carrying out scientific division of labor, and smoothly completing the sowing.

During the autumn harvest of 1945, most of the male laborers in the village went to the front line to participate in the war, and each group had only one male laborer left. Shunda mobilized nineteen women, thirteen old men, and all the children to organize and harvested all the millet in the village in three days. Wang Sizhe said to people after returning from the war: "I was participating in the war outside, and I was really worried when I saw the strong wind. When I came back, I saw that the crops had been harvested for me. Thanks to being organized."

In July 1949, there was a drought and no rain, and the people's enthusiasm for production declined. Li Shunda convened a branch meeting to discuss drought prevention and overcome the pessimistic idea of ​​"seeing the seedlings and harvesting three points." After the meeting, all Party members took active action, leading the villagers to immediately reduce their living standards, eat chaff, collect wild vegetables, and organize transportation to earn money to buy more than 300 jin of grain, 720 jin of chaff, and 380 jin of dried ground vines, overcoming the difficulties.

Intensive cultivation and attention to technology. In the past, Xigou Village had poor cultivation habits. Some people only plowed once a year, and a few did not plow at all. After Li Shunda heard about the experience of plowing three times at the Labor Hero Conference in 1944, he did an experiment when he returned to the village. He first plowed the seven-fen land in front of his house three times, and as a result, he harvested more grain. With his own practical examples, he reversed the old habit of the masses of not plowing in spring.

After 1947, the difficulties of labor and livestock in the village were basically overcome, and the farmers began to demand improved technology. The higher authorities also put forward the call for "intensive cultivation and careful cultivation." At this time, Shunda immediately led mutual aid, processed and added fertilizer, and put forward the slogan "People have turned over, and the land must also turn over," breaking the erroneous experience of the farmers that "there is no skill in farming, just put in effort."

Li Shunda also researched the distance between the millet seedlings on the terraces from three to four inches, five to six inches on the ridge land, and two to three inches on the slope land, according to the past experience of weeding, changing the old habit of thinking that more is better and dense is stronger than sparse, and improved land yield.

Improve agricultural tools. Li Shunda found in production that sowing with a three-legged seed drill resulted in dense seedlings that were not ventilated and easily damaged the crops; sowing with a two-legged seed drill resulted in wide ridges, good ventilation, and labor-saving weeding (three-legged seed drill required seven workdays per mu, while two-legged seed drill required four workdays per mu), and it was also easy to mobilize women to participate in labor, and the yield was also large. During the Tangyin Campaign in 1947, most of the male laborers in the village went to the front line to participate in the war, and almost all the millet in front of and behind the ditch was sown by him with a two-legged seed drill. As a result, the harvests of each household increased by one-third compared with previous years. By the time of sowing in 1948 and 1949, his village had completely switched to using two-legged seed drills. This year, the mutual aid group has also begun to use single-handled plows, liberation-style weeding hoes, sprayers and other new agricultural tools.

Improve varieties. In 1946, the higher authorities called for planting Golden Queen jade sorghum. Shunda did an experiment on his own three-fen land. As a result, each fen of Golden Queen planted with 100 plants could harvest one shi more grain per mu. He immediately organized the masses to visit. The following year, the whole village planted 47 mu. In the same year, the promotion of warm water soaking seeds, the masses did not believe, after Li Shunda's two years of experiments, the results were good. In 1948, more than one-third of the total number of seeds soaked in the village, and in 1949, the number of seeds soaked developed to more than 80%. Lu Heshan, who did not believe in soaking seeds the most, also started soaking seeds this year. In addition, since 1946, according to the principle of "strong mother and fat son," the selection of seeds has been promoted every year. In 1947, a field observation was organized, and excellent seeds were selected for exhibition. And put forward the slogan of "three wants and three don'ts," the three wants are: dry land should choose those that are not dead from drought and can resist drought, gully land should choose those that are not drowned and can resist waterlogging, and insect-eaten land should choose those that are not eaten by insects, called "bitter root ling" can kill insects. The three don'ts are: don't put it in a humid place; don't let the rats spoil it; don't put it in a place smoked by smoke. This year, the excellent seeds have been promoted to 60%, and all of them have been soaked and mixed with seeds.

III. Democratic Home

In the spring of 1946, according to the gradual increase in production, Shunda formulated a five-year production and construction plan after a family meeting and democratic discussion: build eleven houses, dig a water well, repair a millstone, add three new clothes for each person, and a quilt. With the active labor of the whole family, the plan was 100% completed in the autumn of 1948 (a total of three years). Then he formulated the second five-year construction plan, and after nearly two years of efforts by the whole family, it is also close to being fully realized.

Li Shunda's family's five-year construction plan can be completed three years in advance. The family's democracy and harmony, and the mobilization of the production enthusiasm of men, women, old and young is an important factor.

Shunda's family, due to the implementation of democratic management and scientific division of labor, has made field production and housework well-organized. Cai Fu (Shunda's younger brother), Hu Chang (hired worker), and Shunda lead agricultural production and livestock transportation, and Gui Lan (Shunda's daughter-in-law), Qian Qiao (Shunda's younger brother's wife), and Ting Xian (Shunda's younger sister) are led by Li Shunda's mother (who died last year) to manage family life and sideline production such as spinning, weaving, and raising pigs. The whole family holds a family meeting every three months to review their performance in production and life and criticize others' opinions. A family meeting is also held at the beginning of each season to arrange life and make a family plan. Then a personal plan is made. Therefore, all members of the family can consciously work hard in production. In daily life, Li Shunda and his mother also pay attention to listening to everyone's opinions. When construction began, Cai Fu proposed: "When we build a house, we need a lot of people and eat a lot. We should repair the mill first and dig a well so that we can use it immediately." This opinion was adopted, saving a lot of labor.

Because Li Shunda believed in government policies and carefully led the family, the family has made outstanding improvements in political and economic life after nearly eight years of the Great Production Movement. Now the family of twelve has seven Communist Party members (three working outside), eleven houses, three cave dwellings, 30.5 mu of land, five livestock, thirty-four sheep, and more than twenty mu of mountain forest, with an annual income equivalent to more than eighty shi of grain.

IV. Li Shunda's Leadership Experience

(1) Adhere to the mutual aid policy: The mutual aid group conscientiously implements the principle of equal value and mutual benefit, and free entry and exit, and combines organization with improving technology. The main key to the gradual development of Li Shunda's mutual aid group since its establishment in 1943 is that the mutual aid policy has been correctly implemented within the group.

The equal value exchange of Li Shunda's mutual aid group is generally calculated based on the strength of the labor force, and the work points are calculated based on the type of work. Those with good skills get extra points. For example, Yang Laifa has particularly good weeding skills, getting two extra points per day, and Song Maisuo's weeding skills are second only to Laifa, getting one extra point per day. When using livestock, the grades are divided according to the quality of the land (flat, slope, inferior) and the quality of the livestock. The masses in the whole group feel that this method of calculating work points is reasonable and fair.

There is a democratic system within the mutual aid group, rewarding the good and criticizing the bad. Li Shunda leads the mutual aid group to summarize the results, conduct reviews, and elect models at the end of each season. It has a great role in promoting the production enthusiasm of each person.

Under the leadership of Shunda, the Xigou Village mutual aid organization was able to timely get rid of the shackles of experience that remained in the simple stage of overcoming labor and livestock difficulties, and since 1947, it has vigorously led the improvement of technology, so that the mutual aid group has been further consolidated and developed under the new production conditions, and the production of Xigou Village has also gained more harvests.

(2) Have a clear production plan. Li Shunda's leadership in production starts with formulating a household plan, then a group plan, and then promoting it to a village plan. In the spring of 1946, some households in Li Shunda's group developed complacency, thinking: "Production has already reached three years of plowing and one year of surplus. It doesn't matter if we don't cooperate and produce well this year." Li Shunda held a meeting to enlighten them: "It is not enough to reach three years of plowing and one year of surplus. It is better to reach food and clothing." He led all 23 households in the village to formulate a household increase in production plan, pointing out the new production goals.

Li Shunda leads family construction, mastering the principle of giving priority to developing production. For example, his family's first five-year construction plan started on the basis of having a surplus in production. He calculated that annual agricultural production can only have a surplus of 15 shi of grain after eating. To complete his construction plan, he must buy 40 shi of grain every year to purchase wood and other expenses. So he mobilized the whole family to carry out sideline production and also gave special attention to agricultural production. As a result, the family not only did not have a deficit when completing the first five-year construction plan, but also lived a prosperous life.

(3) Paying attention to ideological leadership and fully developing democracy is not only the characteristic of Shunda's family, but also has become a habit in the whole village. Shunda's approach is "discuss everything in meetings, and everyone takes action after ideological unity." In the first few years after the mutual aid was established, the group members often had opinions on the quality of work or who should go first and who should go later. But after Li Shunda led the mutual aid group to hold a meeting, everyone reviewed each other and the problems were solved, and the relationship between the group members was further consolidated.

### 李顺达领导西沟村走向富裕

　　李顺达领导西沟村走向富裕
  一、共产党带来了幸福
    提起平顺县来，熟悉太行山的人，会知道这是个“金、木、水、火、土，五行俱缺”的地方，山大石多，土地贫瘠。西沟就是该县一个偏僻的自然村。
    共产党给穷山沟带来了幸福。几年光景，西沟村起了天大的变化：抗战以前，全村共有耕地一百七十一亩，内有一百一十四亩是租种外村地主的；现在呢，经过减租减息、土地改革、大生产运动，全村农民已拥有耕地二百二十四亩，而且每亩平均产量已由一九四三年时的一石二斗，增至二石一斗。牲口也大大兴旺了，一九四三年全村有羊五只，牲口十五头；现在这个二十三户的小村，有着一百二十七只羊，四十三头牲口。这里本是“糠菜半年粮”的地方，农民们的经常食粮是“糠圪塔”；现在西沟村农民一天三顿都是吃的纯粮。他们已搬进新修的房子，并且每人都有铺有盖，还做到一年三换衣裳（单、夹、棉）……农民蔡荣河说得好：“咱们过去是一篓担就担完了的家当，现在一百担小米也不卖了。”
    这就是土改后新中国新农村的缩影。这个新农村由穷变富的过程，是与共产党的领导，与该村劳动英雄李顺达的领导分不开的。
    李顺达原是河南省林县人，十八年前逃荒来到西沟村。当时全家五口人，一无所有，佃居破窑三孔，租种地主十二亩七分地。人民政府成立后，由于他领导全村组织起来，由穷变富，因而博得了全村农民的爱戴与拥护。一九四四年秋被选为平顺县头等劳动英雄，同年，太行解放区一届劳英会和一九四六年太行二届劳英会上都被选为全区一等劳动英雄。现在他是西沟行政村的中共支部书记。
  二、穷村变富村的道路
    李顺达怎样领导西沟村由贫困变为富裕？
    组织起来，克服困难。一九四二年，平顺遭了旱灾，加之战争的进行，工作繁忙，劳畜力缺乏，群众的生产与生活十分困难。顺达根据当时群众克服困难、坚持生产的要求，积极响应了党所提出的“组织起来生产自救”的号召。一九四三年春，以党员为核心，首先组织起一个六人的互助小组，八天开荒七亩多，积柴一万八千余斤，启发了群众生产自救信心与互助的积极性，互助组很快的发展到十六户，又分成了三个小组，李顺达被选为大队长。接着互助组又发动了互借互济，解决了组内没粮吃的困难，一股劲开荒一百二十多亩。秋后收下山药一千余口袋，全村度过了当年的灾荒。一九四四年，全部开的荒地种成了谷子，秋后收谷一百二十余石。秋收只李顺达家十九亩地，就打了四十九大石粮食，生产初步扎住了根。
    二十多户的小村，参军和外出工作的即有八人，一九四四年至一九四五年的战勤任务又十分繁重，加上大调民力捕打蝗虫，劳畜力感到不足。李顺达领导全村组织起来，精确计算，订出十五天的送肥、耙地、耕地、下种计划，吸收半、辅劳力，进行科学分工，顺利完成了下种。
    一九四五年秋收时，村上男全劳力大部参战到前方，各组只剩下一个男劳力。顺达动员十九个妇女，十三个老汉，与全部儿童组织起来，三天就把全村的谷子割完。王四则参战回来后对人说：“我在外面参战，看见刮大风实在不放心，回来时一看，庄稼都给我收割了。多亏组织起来。”
    一九四九年七月间，天旱不雨，群众生产劲头消沉。李顺达召开支部会议，讨论防旱，克服了“见苗三分收”的消极等待思想。会后全体党员积极行动，领导全村群众立即降低生活水平，吃糠，采集野菜并组织运输赚钱买粮食三百余斤，糠七百二十斤，干地蔓三百八十斤，克服了困难。
    精耕细作，讲究技术。西沟村过去耕地习惯差，有的一年只耕一次，还有少数的根本不耕。李顺达在一九四四年劳英会上听了各地介绍犁三遍的经验后，回村便做试验。他首先把自己门前的七分地犁了三次，结果多打了粮食。用自己的实际例子，扭转了群众春不犁地的旧习惯。
    一九四七年以后，该村劳畜力困难已基本克服，农民开始要求提高技术，上级也提出了“精耕细作”的号召。这时，顺达即领导互助，加工加肥，提出了“人翻了身，土地也要翻身”的口号，打破了农民“种地没巧、出力就好”的错误经验。
    李顺达又根据历来的锄苗经验，研究出梯田的谷苗距离三寸至四寸，圪岗地五寸至六寸，坡地二寸至三寸，改变了过去认为多留多收，稠比稀强的守旧习惯，提高了土地产量。
    改良农具。李顺达在生产中发现用三条腿耧播种，苗稠不通风，容易坏庄稼；用两条腿耧播种垅宽，通风，锄苗还省工（三条腿耧一亩需七个工，两条腿耧一亩四个工），又易于发动妇女参加劳动，收量也大。一九四七年汤阴战役，村上的男劳力大部都参战去了，沟前沟后的谷子差不多都是他用两条腿耧种上的。结果各家的收成都较往年增加三分之一。到四八、四九年播种时，他村已全部改用两条腿耧。今年互助组并已开始使用单把犁，解放式耘锄，喷雾器等新式农具。
    改良品种。一九四六年，上级号召种金皇后玉茭，顺达在自己三分地里作实验，结果每分地种一百棵的金皇后每亩可多打粮一石。当即组织群众参观。第二年全村就种了四十七亩。同年推广温汤浸种，群众不相信，经过李顺达二年的试验，结果收效良好。一九四八年全村浸种的达总数三分之一以上，四九年浸种的已发展到百分之八十以上。最不相信浸种的路河山，今年也开始浸种。另外从四六年开始根据“母壮儿肥”的道理，年年提倡选种。一九四七年组织了田间观摩，选出优种进行展览。并提出“三要三不要”的口号，三要是：旱地选没旱死的能抗旱，圪道地选没淹死的能抗涝，虫吃地选没被虫吃的叫“苦根苓”能杀虫。三不要是：不要放在潮湿地方；不要让老鼠糟踏了；不要放在烟薰的地方。到今年优种已推广到百分之六十，并全部作到浸种、拌种。
  三、民主之家
    一九四六年春天，顺达根据生产的逐年提高，经过家庭会议，民主讨论订出了五年生产建设计划：盖房子十一间，打水井一眼，修碾一盘，每人添三身新衣，一条被子。在全家一齐动手积极劳动下，于一九四八年秋（共三年时间）即百分之百的完成了计划。接着又制订了第二个五年建设计划，经全家将近二年来的努力，又已接近全部实现。
    李顺达的家庭五年建设计划能在三年内提前完成。全家的民主和睦，发挥了男女老少的生产积极性是一个重要的因素。
    顺达全家，由于实行了民主管理，科学分工，做到了田间生产和家务事，都是有条有理的。才富（顺达弟）胡昌（雇工）顺达三人领导农业生产和牲口运输，桂兰（顺达媳妇）前巧（顺达弟媳）廷先（顺达妹）由李顺达娘（去年已死）领导管理家庭生活和纺织、喂猪等副业生产。三个月全家开一次家庭会议，个人对自己在生产中生活中的表现，进行检讨，对别人有啥意见提出批评。每个季节的开始也召开家庭会议，安排生活，订个全家计划。然后再订出个人计划。因之，全家大小都能自觉的努力生产。在日常生活中，李顺达和他娘也注意听取大家意见。开始建设时，才富提出：“咱盖房子，用人多吃的多，先修好碾，打好井，马上就能用。”采纳了这个意见，省工很多。
    由于李顺达相信政府政策，细心领导家庭，经过了将近八年来的大生产运动，全家在政治生活与经济生活上都有了突出的提高。现全家十二口人中有七个共产党员（三个在外工作），有十一间房，三孔窑，三十亩五分地，五头牲畜，三十四只羊，二十余亩山林，每年的收入合粮食八十石以上。
  四、李顺达的领导经验
    （一）坚持互助政策：互助组认真贯彻等价两利、出入自由的原则，并做到组织起来与提高技术结合。李顺达的互助组从四三年成立以来逐年发展，主要关键即是组内正确执行了互助政策。
    李顺达互助组的等价交换，一般是以劳力强弱折死分，按活不同折活分，技术好的加分。如杨来发锄苗技术特别好，一天加二分，宋买锁锄苗技术仅次于来发，一天加一分。使用牲口时，以地好坏（平、坡、劣）牲口好坏分等。这样的折工计分方法，全组的群众都觉得合理公道。
    互助组内有民主制度，好的奖励，坏的批评。李顺达领导互助组每一季节终了，都经过小组讨论，总结成果，进行检讨，评选模范。对每个人的生产积极性都有很大推动作用。
    西沟村互助组织在顺达领导下，能够及时的摆脱停留在单纯克服劳畜力困难阶段的经验束缚，从一九四七年以后即大力领导提高技术，使互助组在新的生产条件下，得到了进一步巩固与发展，使西沟村的生产也得到了更多的收获。
    （二）有明确的生产计划。李顺达的领导生产是从订按家计划做起，再订出全组计划，推广到全村计划。一九四六年春，李顺达小组有些户产生了自满思想，认为：“生产都已达到耕三余一了，今年不好好互助生产，也没有什么大的关系。”李顺达便开会启发：“光达到耕三余一还不算，要达到丰衣足食才更好。”领导全村二十三户都订了按家增产计划，指明了新的生产奋斗目标。
    李顺达领导家庭建设，掌握了以发展生产为主，如他家的第一个五年建设计划，即是在生产有了剩余的基础上开始的。他计算每年的农业生产除去吃只能余十五石粮食，要完成他的建设计划，每年则必须四十石粮食购买木料与其他开支，所以便发动了全家进行副业生产，在农业生产上也特别加工。结果做到在完成第一个五年建设计划时，家里不但没有亏空，而生活仍过得富裕。
    （三）重视思想领导，充分发扬民主，不仅是顺达家庭的特点，在全村也已成为习惯。顺达的做法是“遇事开会商量，思想一致后大家动手”。互助刚成立的那几年，组员们往往在做活好坏，或谁先谁后上闹意见。但经过李顺达领导互助组开会，大家互相检讨后，都得到解决，组员关系得到了进一的步巩固。（附图片）
