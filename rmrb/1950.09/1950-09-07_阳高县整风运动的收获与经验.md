　　The Gains and Experiences of the Rectification Movement in Yanggao County
　　Zhou Xiuqing, Head of the Propaganda Department of the Yanggao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　The rectification movement in Yanggao County, Chahar Province, began on July 1st and ended on August 24th. From July 1st, various agencies studied Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session and other rectification documents. Various districts also began studying the documents one after another. On August 1st, the entire County Committee began to review its work, and key cadres from county-level departments were invited to attend and assist the County Committee in reviewing its leadership. At the same time, various departments also held meetings to review the leadership of the County Committee. On August 16th, an enlarged cadre meeting was held. At the meeting, County Committee Secretary Liu Zhengguo explained Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session. Other members of the County Committee, in connection with the specific situation of the county, made special reports on the four major issues of "adjusting industry and commerce," "correcting the direction of rural production," "the united front," and "suppressing counter-revolutionaries," to inspire everyone to deeply discuss, and connect the review of work and leadership with individuals. The meeting ended on August 24th.

    Based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's report, the main problems in the work were systematically exposed, and solutions were proposed.

　　During the fifty-four days of the rectification movement, the biggest gain was: According to the spirit of Chairman Mao's report at the Third Plenary Session, various tasks were reviewed, the main problems in the various tasks were systematically exposed, and concrete plans for improving the work in the future were made, so that cadres throughout the county had a clear understanding of the Party's general line and general policy. The main problems identified in this rectification were as follows: First, bureaucratism and commandism existed widely and seriously. The bureaucratism in the leadership of the County Committee was mainly manifested in: a very poor understanding of the level of cadres below, the degree of awareness of the masses, and other working conditions. Therefore, it was difficult to formulate plans, make resolutions, and issue instructions from the actual situation. The difficulties of the lower levels were underestimated, and the tasks required of the lower levels were too high and too urgent. For example, when deploying the autumn grain requisition last year, the County Committee required that it be completed in its entirety in twenty-two days. This year, when deploying spring work, it was subjectively required that 100% of seeds be soaked. Therefore, district cadres were forced to use unscrupulous means and disregard methods, and use coercion to complete the tasks. Commandism in the districts was widespread and serious. In the autumn cultivation last year, because the task was required urgently, the Third District forced some of the masses to work in the fields with lanterns; some, because they were forced too tightly by the district cadres, carried plows to the fields to sleep, or scraped the ground a little with a harrow to deceive the cadres. Because of the use of coercion, matters that were originally directly related to the interests of the masses were instead opposed by the masses, resulting in the Party and the government being divorced from the masses and losing prestige. Second, the County Committee did not provide enough leadership for economic work, and rarely conducted investigations, studies or learning of economic work, thus demonstrating incompetence in leadership. Cadres in economic departments often focused on one aspect and neglected others in their leadership of the five types of economy, and could not achieve overall planning, comprehensive consideration, division of labor and cooperation. For example, they emphasized the development of agricultural production and neglected handicrafts, and even the Chengguan District Committee neglected the leadership of industry and commerce; they paid attention to the state-owned commerce but neglected the private commerce, etc. Third, the one-sided view of the poor and hired peasants among rural work cadres has not been thoroughly corrected. Therefore, in some village governments, there is still a phenomenon of squeezing out the middle peasants. When Luowenzao Village in the Ninth District elected people's representatives last year, a middle peasant was elected. Originally, this middle peasant performed very well, but because he was a wealthy middle peasant, he was disqualified as a representative. As a result, there were very few middle peasants in some village governments. When some district and village cadres handled disputes among peasants, they always asked about their class background first, always wanting to protect the poor and hired peasants, causing the middle and rich peasants to suffer. These comrades mistakenly regarded the one-sided view of the poor and hired peasants as a class viewpoint, or thought that "left is better than right." In fact, the result of doing so affected the unity of the peasants and affected labor production. Fourth, there was insufficient education on the united front policy, so cadres still had some confused ideas about it. Some district cadres believed that the united front could be talked about at the higher levels, but there was no need to talk about the united front in the districts and villages, since there were no democratic personages or national bourgeoisie. Individual cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds had narrow and conservative ideas, unwilling to unite and cooperate with intellectuals, even saying: "I always find intellectuals unpleasant to look at, and I will never be able to unite with them in my life." Fifth, there were biases in the implementation of the leniency policy, with some being "unlimitedly lenient." For example, the handling of habitual murderers was not timely; and the sabotage organizations of landlords and hooligans were not properly handled. As a result, some petty thieves mistakenly thought that "big bandits won't die if they're sent to the government, so it doesn't matter if we steal something." Therefore, they openly carried out theft. The masses saw it but did not dare to arrest them, fearing that the petty thieves would return and retaliate against them. The masses were dissatisfied with the government's "unlimited leniency." The reason for this bias was mainly that cadres had a biased understanding of the leniency policy, coupled with the fact that cadres had a one-sided view of the poor and hired peasants, thinking that "petty thieves are poor, it's okay to steal a little." At the meeting, solutions were formulated for correcting these main problems. For example, to address the closed-doorist deviation in the implementation of the united front policy, in addition to the County Committee giving a special report to conduct education, it was also decided that the Party members and cadres would be regularly educated on the united front policy; democratic systems would be improved, democracy would be fully promoted, and people's representative meetings would be held at the county, district, and village levels. The various organs and branches also formulated plans to strengthen unity and cooperation with non-Party masses, ensuring the implementation of the united front policy. To address the deviation of neglecting the leadership of industry and commerce, specific corrective measures were also made: 1. The County Committee will strengthen its leadership over economic departments, and the County Committee will regularly study industry and commerce issues, and designate two County Committee members to specifically lead industry and commerce work. The County Committee Secretary should also use a certain amount of effort to lead. 2. The Chengguan District Committee should focus on leading industry and commerce. 3. The County Committee should participate in important meetings of economic departments. If economic departments encounter major problems, they may request the County Committee to convene a County Committee meeting for discussion, etc.

    Strengthen the unity among cadres, close the relationship between the Party and the masses, and ensure the implementation of the mass line.

　　Another gain of the rectification study was to further strengthen the unity among cadres, close the relationship between the Party and the masses, combat commandism, and implement the mass line. For example, among the County Committees, in the past, there was superficially harmony, but in reality, there was mutual distrust, opinions were not raised, and even mutual suspicion. In the rectification, criticism and self-criticism were carried out, democracy was promoted, and everyone expressed their inner thoughts, and also distinguished the responsibilities, merits and demerits of the work, eliminated mutual suspicions, strengthened unity, and greatly improved the working mood. Those who were not active in the past are now active. In reviewing the work, the majority of non-Party cadres offered well-intentioned criticisms of the Party committees and Party members, the relationship between the Party and the masses was more harmonious than before, and the non-Party cadres were full of enthusiasm. Commandism was also greatly attacked, and the cadres realized that commandism had three harms: "harming the people, harming the Party, and harming oneself." Therefore, they were determined to eliminate it. Other incorrect ideas were also criticized in the rectification, and most comrades felt relaxed and happy.

　　The following experiences were gained in this rectification:

    Timely dispel concerns and rectify the attitude of cadres towards rectification.

　　1. Timely dispelling concerns and rectifying the attitude of cadres towards rectification is the first key to the smooth progress of the rectification movement. At the beginning of the enlarged cadre meeting, cadres had various ideological concerns that hindered the development of the movement. Some leading cadres were afraid of losing prestige and did not dare to boldly expose shortcomings; some were afraid of becoming typical examples in the rectification and did not dare to expose their own mistakes; some felt that they were new cadres, or that they did office work and had nothing to rectify, etc. Therefore, in addition to mobilization by the responsible comrades, in-depth explanations were given in various groups, or explanations and mobilizations were carried out through individual talks, and these concerns were dispelled in a timely manner, ensuring the smooth progress of the meeting.

    Closely combine the three basic links of studying documents, summarizing work, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

　　2. Following Chairman Mao's instructions to closely combine the methods of studying documents, summarizing work, analyzing the situation, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism, the main problems were effectively identified, and improvement measures were formulated. In the rectification, some groups did not do this, and some discussed the documents only from the documents, without combining them with the review of work; others carried out the review of work and criticism without reference to the spirit of the documents. The problems identified in this way were mostly fragmented problems and lifestyle details. Secondly, the review of work and leadership should be linked to individuals. For example, when various districts reviewed the district committees, they mostly focused on reviewing the main work of the district, reviewing the leadership of the district committee from the problems discovered in the review of work, and distinguishing the responsibilities of individuals. This will identify the main problems of work, leadership, and individuals, and distinguish merits, demerits, right and wrong, and the size of responsibilities. In addition, in the review of work, leading comrades must prepare and plan to induce everyone to expose and solve the main problems. At this enlarged cadre meeting, the County Committee, based on Chairman Mao's report and in connection with the actual situation in the county, put forward the main problems of neglecting the leadership of industry and commerce, closed-doorism in united front work, the view of poor and hired peasants in rural work, and "unlimited leniency" in public security work. This allowed everyone to find the main problems from the beginning and smoothly carry out the review.

    Announce the crimes of bureaucratism and commandism, and formulate specific measures to overcome them.

　　3. To overcome bureaucratism and commandism, cadres must deeply understand their harm and formulate measures to overcome them. The experience of this meeting proves that some cadres who understand the harm of bureaucratism and commandism can earnestly review their work and seriously conduct criticism and self-criticism. On the contrary, some cadres, due to insufficient understanding of their harm, believe that everyone has a little bit of bureaucratism and commandism, and even leading cadres are inevitable, so it doesn't matter if they have a little bit. Some people even don't feel ashamed of wearing the hat of "bureaucratism and commandism." Others think that hard-working bureaucratism is better than idle bureaucratism, and they can't stand it when others criticize them for being idle all day long; if it's hard-working bureaucratism, then they still have hard work. This is the biggest obstacle to opposing bureaucratism and commandism, and it is an abnormal phenomenon. We tried to break this obstacle: first, we pointed out the evil consequences of bureaucratism, announced its crimes, and raised everyone's vigilance against this enemy. Secondly, we exposed bureaucratism and commandism while conducting education on the mass line. The County Committee Secretary gave a special report on the mass line at the meeting, and in connection with the local situation, introduced the methods and experiences of the mass line, pointing out that in the future, district and village representative meetings should be held well, and the work style of cadres should be reviewed and improved through the representative meetings, etc.

    Check the work style of cadres and strengthen the connection between the Party and the people through the People's Representative Conference.

　　4. Through the People's Representative Conference, rectifying the work style of cadres is an effective method. The Tenth District once convened a District People's Representative Conference to check the bureaucratism and commandism work style of cadres. After the meeting, the work style of cadres had a great change, and the relationship between the Party and the masses was also improved. Therefore, it was proposed at this meeting that the work style of cadres should be checked at every People's Representative Conference in the future, in order to expand and consolidate the connection between the Party and the government and the people.

　　阳高县整风运动的收获与经验
    中共阳高县委宣传部长  周秀清
    察哈尔省阳高县整风运动于七月一日开始，八月二十四日结束。七月一日起，各机关分别学习毛主席在三中全会的报告与其他整风文件。各区也先后开始学习文件。八月一日全体县委开始检查工作，并吸收县级各部门主要干部列席参加，帮助县委检查领导。同时各部门也分别召开会议，检查县委领导。八月十六日又召开扩大干部会议。会上县委书记刘正国讲解毛主席在三中全会的报告。并有其他县委联系本县具体情况，对“调整工商业”、“端正农村生产方向”、“统一战线”、“镇压反革命”等四大问题，作了专题报告，启发大家深入讨论，和检查工作、检查领导联系个人。会议于二十四日结束。
    根据毛主席报告精神，系统地揭发了工作中的主要问题并提出纠正办法。
    在五十四天的整风运动中，最大的收获是：根据毛主席在三中全会报告的精神，检查了各种工作，系统地揭露了各种工作中的主要问题，并做出今后改进工作的具体计划，使全县干部对党的总路线总政策有了明确的认识。这次整风中检查出的主要问题有以下五个：第一，官僚主义与命令主义作风普遍而严重的存在。县委领导上的官僚主义主要表现在：对下面的干部水平和群众觉悟程度以及其他工作条件都了解很差。因此订计划、做决议、发指示就很难从实际情况出发。对下级的困难估计过低，对下级要求的任务过高过急。如去年布置秋征工作，县委要求二十二天全部完成。今年布置春季工作，又主观的要求百分之百的浸种。因此迫使区干部不择手段、不讲方式，而用强迫命令去完成任务。区里的命令主义是普遍而严重的。在去年秋耕中，因为要求任务急，三区逼的有些群众打着灯笼上地；也有些因为区干部逼得紧便背着犁到地里睡觉，或者是用耙挖破点地皮以欺哄支吾干部。由于强迫命令，使得原是直接关系群众利益的事情反而遭到群众反对，结果使党和政府脱离群众、丧失威信。第二，县委对经济工作领导不够，对经济工作很少调查研究与学习，因此表现领导上无能。经济部门干部对五种经济的领导，常常顾此失彼，不能做到统筹兼顾、分工合作。比如重视了发展农业生产，就忽视了手工业，甚至连城关区委也忽视了对工商业的领导；注意了公营商业而忽视了私营商业等。第三，对于农村工作干部中的片面的贫雇观点，并未彻底纠正。因此有些村政权中，还有排挤中农的现象。九区罗文皂村去年选人民代表时选上一个中农。本来这个中农表现很好，但因他是个富裕中农，结果被取消了代表资格。这样，有些村政权里中农就很少。有些区村干部处理农民中间的纠纷时，总是先问成份，老想庇护贫雇农，使中农、富农吃点亏。这些同志错误地把片面的贫雇观点当做阶级观点，或者是以为“左比右好”。实际上，这样做的结果影响到农民的团结，影响到劳动生产。第四，统一战线政策教育不够，因此干部对此还有些糊涂思想。有些区干部认为上级可以讲统一战线，区村既无民主人士，又无民族资产阶级，没有讲统一战线的必要。个别工农出身的干部存在着狭隘保守思想，不愿和知识分子团结合作，甚至说：“我总是看着知识分子不顺眼，一辈子也和他们团结不了。”第五，在执行宽大政策中有偏向，有些“宽大无边”。如对杀人惯匪处理不及时；对地主流氓的破坏组织也没有适当处理。因此使一些小偷误认为“大土匪送到政府死不了，咱偷点东西没关系。”因而明目张胆的进行偷盗。群众看到了也不敢捉拿，怕小偷回来了报复他们。群众对政府这种“宽大无边”的作法是不满的。发生这种偏向的原因主要是干部对宽大政策认识有偏差，再加上干部中存有片面的贫雇观点，认为“小偷穷，偷点没啥”所致。会议中对检查出的这些主要问题分别定出了纠正办法。如对执行统一战线政策中的关门主义偏向，除县委做专题报告进行教育外，并决定今后经常要对党员干部进行统一战线政策教育；健全民主制度，充分发扬民主，开好县区村三级人民代表会议。各机关支部也订出了加强与非党群众团结合作的计划，保证贯彻统一战线政策。对忽视对工商业领导的偏向，也做出了具体纠正办法：一、县委加强对经济部门的领导，县委要定期研究工商业问题，并确定两个县委专门领导工商业工作。县委书记也要用一定力量来领导。二、城关区委以领导工商业为重点。三、经济部门的重要会议县委要参加。经济部门遇有重大问题，可提请县委召开县委会讨论等。
    加强干部间团结，密切党群关系，保证群众路线的贯彻。
    整风学习的另一收获是进一步加强了干部间的团结，密切了党群关系，打击了命令主义，贯彻了群众路线。如各县委之间，过去表面上看是一团和气，实际上是互不信任，有意见不提，甚至互相猜忌。整风中开展了批评与自我批评，发扬了民主，彼此都谈出了心里的话，也分清了工作中的责任功过，消除了相互间的猜忌，加强了团结，工作情绪大大提高。过去不积极的现在也积极起来了。在检查工作中，大部非党干部对党委与党员都提出了善意的批评，党群关系较前融洽，非党干部情绪饱满。命令主义作风也受到了很大的打击，干部们认识了命令主义有三害：“害人民，害党，害自己。”因此下决心要消灭它。其他一些不正确思想在整风中也都受到批判，大部同志感到轻松愉快。
    这次整风中体会到以下几点经验：
    及时解除顾虑，端正干部整风态度。
    一、及时解除顾虑，端正干部整风态度，是整风运动顺利开展的头一个关键。扩干会开始时，干部中存在着各种各样的思想顾虑，障碍着运动的开展。有些领导干部怕失掉威信，不敢大胆揭发缺点；有的人怕在整风中做典型而不敢暴露自己的错误；有些人认为自己是新干部，或者是做机关工作而无啥可整等等。因此除由负责同志动员外，并深入各小组进行解释，或者通过个别谈话解释动员，及时消除了这些顾虑，保证会议的顺利进行。
    把学习文件、总结工作、展开批评与自我批评三个基本环节密切结合起来。
    二、遵照毛主席所指示的把学习文件、总结工作、分析情况、开展批评与自我批评等方法密切结合起来，因而有效地检查出了主要问题，并定出了改进的办法。在整风中有个别小组没有这样做，有的就文件讨论文件，而不结合检查工作；有的检查工作开展批评时离开了文件精神。这样检查出来的多半是些零碎问题和生活细节。其次，检查工作、检查领导中要联系个人。如各区检查区委时，大都以检查本区主要工作为主，从检查工作所发现的问题中检查区委的领导，并分清个人的责任。这样就能检查出工作、领导及个人的主要问题，并分清了功过是非与责任大小。另外，在检查工作中，领导同志必须有准备地有计划地来诱导大家揭露主要问题并解决主要问题。这次扩干会议上，县委事先根据毛主席报告联系本县实际情况，提出了忽视工商业领导，统战工作中的关门主义，农村工作中的贫雇观点，公安工作中的“宽大无边”等主要问题。这样使大家一开始就找到了主要问题，顺利地进行了检查。
    公布官僚主义命令主义罪状，定出具体克服办法。
    三、要克服官僚主义与命令主义，必须使干部深刻认识其危害性，并定出克服办法。这次会议经验证明，有些干部认识了官僚主义、命令主义的危害性，就能够认真的进行检查工作和严肃地进行批评与自我批评。相反的，有的干部由于对其危害性认识不足，便认为官僚主义、命令主义作风人人都有点，甚至领导干部也免不了，那么自己有一点也没什么。甚至有些人戴上了“官僚主义、命令主义”的帽子还不以为耻。还有的人认为辛辛苦苦的官僚主义比饱食终日的官僚主义好，别人批评自己饱食终日无所用心时受不了；如果是辛辛苦苦的官僚主义那自己还有苦劳。这是反对官僚主义与命令主义的最大障碍，是一种反常现象。我们设法打破了这一障碍：首先指出官僚主义的恶果，公布它的罪状，提高大家对这一敌人的警惕性。其次是一面揭发官僚主义、命令主义，一面进行群众路线的教育。县委书记在会议上做了群众路线的专题报告，并联系本地情况介绍群众路线的办法与经验，指出今后要开好区村代表会，通过代表会来检查改进干部的工作作风等等。
    通过人民代表会议检查干部作风，加强党与人民的联系。
    四、通过人民代表会议，整顿干部作风，是一个有效的方法。十区曾召开了区人民代表会议，检查干部中的官僚主义和命令主义作风。会后干部作风有极大转变，党群关系也有所改善。因之这次会议中提出今后每次人民代表会议都要检查干部作风，以扩大并巩固党和政府与人民群众的联系。
