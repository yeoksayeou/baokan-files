　　Northeast Enterprises and Mines Achieve Great Success in Propaganda and Mobilization Work in Production
    [Our Newspaper] Northeast enterprises and mines, in carrying out propaganda and mobilization work, have closely coordinated with production and production emulation campaigns. Propaganda and mobilization work has become one of the important working methods for doing a good job in production.
    Since the Northeast Bureau convened the Propaganda and Mobilization Work Conference for Industrial and Mining Enterprises in May this year, the propaganda and mobilization work in various factories and mines has made great progress, correcting the past neglect of propaganda and mobilization work by many cadres and correcting the phenomenon of some units being divorced from production in propaganda and mobilization work.
    Whether propaganda and mobilization work is done well has a great relationship to the completion of production tasks and the improvement of workers' class consciousness. The chlorobenzene workshop of Shenyang Chemical Plant, due to its attention to propaganda and mobilization through blackboards, reported production completion in a timely manner, and used criticism and self-criticism, criticizing shortcomings in work and praising workers' progress. As a result, it has completed or exceeded production tasks every month since April. In the past, the administration completely ignored the blackboard newspapers. After propaganda and mobilization achieved results, the administration immediately provided propaganda and mobilization personnel from the trade union with a lot of materials that needed to be praised or announced. Since the large-scale plant-wide competition started in Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 4 in May, the production quantity and quality of everyone have been significantly improved due to the good coordination of propaganda and mobilization and the timely praise of the progress of the workers. For example, before the workshop did not engage in propaganda and mobilization work, the daily production volume was 4,700 pairs, and after the development of propaganda and mobilization work, the daily output has reached 5,300 pairs. Since June, the Mudanjiang Locomotive Depot has announced its production plans, and summarized and announced the results of each group in a timely manner, thus launching a mutual challenge among various units to eliminate accidents and overcome violations of labor discipline, creating a daily car maximum record of 588.3 kilometers.
    The forms of propaganda and mobilization in various factories and mines in Northeast China mainly include blackboards, work progress charts, production competition comparison charts, news reports, express reports, competition red flags, waste product exhibitions or product exhibitions, workshop slogans, broadcasting, and wall newspapers. The blackboard newspaper is the most widely used propaganda tool, mostly in workshops and places where workers gather after work. According to statistics from eighteen industrial units in Shenyang City, there are 1,105 blackboards, which are published on average once every three days. Some factory blackboard newspapers use a large number of cartoons and pictures, which workers like to read more. Work progress charts and production competition comparison charts mainly report the output quality of each group or each person, inspiring the enthusiasm of workers for competition. Some factories use airplanes, trains, cars, and horse-drawn carriages to indicate the progress of production. News reports and express reports are posted everywhere to report the good news after a certain group or workshop completes its task. Waste product exhibitions or product exhibitions use facts to educate everyone to pay attention to quality and be vigilant against the generation of waste products. This has been held in the machine repair shop of Anshan Iron and Steel and Shenyang Machine Factory No. 3, and the effect is very great. Workshop slogans are the goals and work rules put forward based on production tasks and actual conditions. This is extremely common in various factories in Shenyang, and it is very vivid and concise.
    The experience of propaganda and mobilization work in Northeast factories and mines mainly includes the following four points:
    First, propaganda and mobilization must be closely integrated with production, coordinated with production, and more importantly, must be combined with the specific situation and actual problems of factories and mines. For example, the Northeast Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, based on checking the reasons for the failure to complete production tasks, put forward the slogan "Give play to latent productivity, complete and exceed 6,000 tasks"; Shenyang Machine Factory No. 3's machine tool product quality was poor in the past, and the skills of new workers were poor, so it put forward the slogans "Stamp steel stamps on every machine" (qualified products) and "Welcome veterans to come forward." In this way, workers can be given clear goals to strive for.
    Second, the forms of propaganda and mobilization should be diverse, striving for forms that workers can understand and like. Such as pictures and workshop slogans, workers are very welcome.
    Third, propaganda and mobilization must be carried out in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism. However, praise is the main thing. All achievements and progress should be praised, and shortcomings must be appropriately criticized. Shenyang Machine Factory No. 3 established the "Root-Tracing Report" in order to find out the phenomenon of no one being responsible for production, which is also carried out using criticism and self-criticism.
    Fourth, propaganda and mobilization work must have unified leadership. According to the experience of Northeast factories and mines, the Party, the administration, and the trade union must attach importance to propaganda and mobilization work in their leadership, and a unified organization must be established under the leadership of the Party.

### 东北企业厂矿生产中宣传鼓动工作很有成绩

　　东北企业厂矿生产中宣传鼓动工作很有成绩
    【本报讯】东北企业厂矿在进行宣传鼓动工作中，由于密切的配合了生产，配合了生产竞赛运动，宣传鼓动工作已成为搞好生产的重要工作方法之一。
    自今年五月东北局召开了工矿企业宣传鼓动工作会议以来，各厂矿的宣传鼓动工作即有很大的进展，纠正了过去不少干部对宣传鼓动工作轻视的思想，纠正某些单位在宣传鼓动工作和生产脱节的现象。
    宣传鼓动工作搞得好不好，对于生产任务的完成，提高工人的阶级觉悟有很大关系。沈阳化工厂氯化苯场由于注意了黑板报的宣传鼓动，随时报告生产完成情况，并运用了批评与自我批评，批评工作中的缺点，表扬工人的进步，结果从四月以来每月都完成或超过了生产任务。行政上过去对黑板报根本不闻不问，宣传鼓动有成绩后，行政上即把许多需要表扬或需要公布的材料供给工会的宣传鼓动员。沈阳橡胶四厂自五月间展开全厂大竞赛后，由于宣传鼓动配合的好，随时表扬了工友们的进步，大家的生产数量及质量都有显著的提高。如该厂制帮间没有搞宣传鼓动工作以前，每天的生产量是四千七百双，宣传鼓动工作开展后，日产量已达到五千三百双。牡丹江机务段自六月以后，生产计划都加以公布，并随时总结及公布各组的成绩，于是掀起了各单位消灭事故和克服违反劳动纪律的互相挑战，创造了五八八·三公里的日车最高纪录。
    东北各厂矿的宣传鼓动形式，主要是以黑板报、工作进度表，生产竞赛比较图、喜报、快报、竞赛红旗、废品展览或产品展览会、车间口号、广播、墙报等为主。黑板报是最广泛的宣传工具，大多是在车间和工人下班后聚集的场所。根据沈阳市十八个产业单位的统计，有黑板报一一○五块，平均三天出一次。有些厂子的黑板报由于采用了大量的漫画、图画，工人更喜爱看。工作进度表和生产竞赛比较图，主要是报告每个小组或每个人的产量质量，启发职工竞赛的热情。有的厂用飞机、火车、汽车、马车等标明生产的进度。喜报、快报则是在某个组或某个车间完成任务后，贴到各处去报喜。废品展览或产品展览则是用事实教育大家注意质量与警惕废品产生，这在鞍钢的机修厂和沈阳机器三厂都举行过，作用非常大。车间口号，是根据生产任务和实际情况提出的奋斗目标和工作规则。这在沈阳各厂已极其普遍，而且非常生动简明。
    东北厂矿宣传鼓动工作的经验，主要有以下四点：
    第一、宣传鼓动必须紧密结合生产，配合生产，而更重要的必须结合厂矿的具体情况和实际问题。比如东北化学制药厂，根据检查生产完不成任务的原因，提出“发挥潜伏的生产力，完成与超过六○○○件任务”的口号；沈阳机器三厂过去车床产品质量不好，新工人技术差，于是便提出“台台打钢印”（合标准品）和“欢迎老将出马”的口号。这样，就能给工人指出明确的奋斗目标。
    第二、宣传鼓动形式要多种多样，力求工人能懂和喜爱的形式。如图画和车间标语、口号，工人顶欢迎。
    第三、宣传鼓动，必须是以批评与自我批评的精神来进行。但表扬是主要的，有一点成绩和进步都应表扬，对缺点必须进行适当的批评。沈阳机器三厂为了查明生产中无人负责的现象，并建立了《追根报》，这也是用批评与自我批评来进行的。
    第四、宣传鼓动工作、必须有统一的领导。根据东北厂矿的经验，党、行政和工会领导上对宣传鼓动工作必须重视，并须在党的领导下建立统一的组织。
