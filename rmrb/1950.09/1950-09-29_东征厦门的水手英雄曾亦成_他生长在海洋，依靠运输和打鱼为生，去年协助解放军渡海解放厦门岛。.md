    Zeng Wenjing
    Zeng Yicheng, a sailor hero from Fujian, assisted the People's Liberation Army in crossing the sea to liberate Xiamen Island last year. The two-inch long and three-fen wide scar on his head is a glorious symbol of his injury in that battle.

    His hometown is on a small island across the sea from Xiamen. He grew up in the ocean, often traveling to Xiamen, Taiwan, Fuzhou, Shantou, Wenzhou, and other places, relying on transportation and fishing for a living. He had just returned from the sea a few days before his hometown was liberated.

    His hometown was liberated. At a mass meeting, he heard that the People's Liberation Army needed boatmen to help transport grain, teach soldiers how to sail boats, and prepare to fight Xiamen and Kinmen. He was extremely happy. He thought to himself: "Under the rule of the Kuomintang, boat rents and taxes were so heavy! Fishing and transportation, as soon as you passed a checkpoint, you would be extorted; requisitioning boats and grabbing laborers forced civilian boats to avoid the shore. Now, all this has changed. However, if the ferocious remnants of the bandits still occupy Xiamen, the boats will not be able to go to sea, and the people on the island will only have one way to die." So he immediately signed up to participate in supporting the front line. After the meeting, he went door-to-door to mobilize relatives and friends to participate. Thanks to his efforts and influence, within two days, seventeen boats and fifty-two people voluntarily signed up for the work of supporting the front. At the gathering place, he patiently taught the People's Liberation Army soldiers nautical skills, and he himself began to be influenced by the revolution.

    The order to liberate Xiamen was issued. Zeng Yicheng gloriously accepted the task of transporting troops to land. In order to strengthen their confidence, the boatmen held an oath-taking ceremony before departure. No matter what difficulties they encountered, they would send the People's Liberation Army to the other side.

    Night fell, the sky was dark, and only the starlight flickered slightly. At ten o'clock, the sea was calm and the tide was low, and hundreds of sailing boats sailed east from the coast of Fujian. On the boat steered by Zeng Yicheng, more than eighty soldiers were curled up on both sides of the boat, ready for battle. On the mainland, our army bombarded the enemy's artillery positions in Xiamen with fierce artillery fire. The enemy's bunkers also spewed out dense tongues of fire. The shells of both sides, like shooting stars, crisscrossed in the dark sky.

    After a while, four enemy planes buzzed over, circling for reconnaissance. Suddenly, four bright flares flashed, and the atmosphere at sea suddenly became tense. The enemy's searchlights on the opposite shore also hurriedly emitted dazzling light, sweeping across the vast dark sea. The enemy troops in the bunkers intensified their firepower and fired at the sea. The deafening sound of guns and artillery became a团. Shells flew around the boat, and bullets whizzed past their heads and sides, piercing the masts and cabins, and the sails were almost turned into fragments. Zeng Yicheng calmly steered the rudder and sails, cleverly dodging the boat left and right, escaping the prying eyes of the searchlights, and sailing towards Xiamen like a petrel.

    Suddenly, a missile grazed his left head, and blood gushed out immediately. He leaned against the side of the boat in a daze, but he was still conscious in his heart. He thought: If I loosen the rudder, in this torrent and fire net, it will be related to the lives of more than eighty soldiers and the liberation of Xiamen. So he continued to hold the rudder tightly with his right hand. Although his assistant had bandaged his wound, the blood was still dripping down, soaking his upper body. At this time, five soldiers moved over and surrounded him on the left and right to protect his safety. But he insisted that the soldiers avoid him. He thought: If one soldier is injured, the power to liberate Xiamen will be reduced by one point. He gritted his teeth and persevered, driving the boat into the enemy's position.

    Our army waded ashore, but the enemy was still resisting frantically. A bloody battle unfolded on the shore. The sound of machine guns, cannons, the shouts of our army's charge, the wails of the wounded enemy... mixed together. Our army quickly broke through the barbed wire, seized the beachhead position, and threw hand grenades into the enemy's artillery bunkers. Blazing flames spewed out from the muzzle of the artillery. The heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army, who rushed forward one after another, made him even more excited. He forgot his serious injuries and automatically carried three military bamboo ladders to the shore, set them up, and let the soldiers go to capture Xiaoqiu, occupied by the enemy, and control the commanding heights. Then he carried hand grenades from the boat and handed them to the soldiers on the top of the ladder, so that they could bombard the enemy's position.

    After a fierce battle, our army's personnel and ammunition needed replenishment. Zeng Yicheng volunteered to take on this arduous task. While steering the rudder, he directed the pulling of the sails, transporting troops and ammunition back and forth three times.

    When the dawn rose from the eastern sea, our army had completely occupied the enemy's position on the coast. But the highlands were still in the hands of the enemy, and the fierce battle continued. Zeng Yicheng still disregarded his hard work and pain, and used the terrain to send bullets from the seashore to our army's trenches, persisting until most of Xiamen was liberated. Due to excessive bleeding, overwork, no sleep for two days and one night, and no food for five meals, he fainted.

    Xiamen Island was completely liberated. All the enemies were annihilated. The banner of victory fluttered on the highlands. At this time, he was taken to the hospital for treatment by ambulance. During the four weeks of recuperation, he deeply appreciated the care of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government. After being discharged from the hospital, he immediately requested to continue supporting the front line, and again took on the important task of maritime transportation. In his work, he also mobilized twenty-one sailing boats to participate in the transportation in support of the front through friends. In addition, three merchant ships also participated in the ranks of supporting the front under his influence. At the Xiamen celebration meeting in October last year, he was rated as a special-class meritorious person. In September of this year, Fujian Province held a model worker representative conference, and he attended as a representative of the Quanzhou Special Zone. Now he has been selected as a representative of Fujian Province to attend the National Labor Model Representative Conference.

    On the train to Beijing and Shanghai, the reporter asked him: "What are your thoughts on going to Beijing?" He said: "I am familiar with the ocean around Fujian and Taiwan. I have also wandered on Taiwan Island for many years. Now that Taiwan is to be liberated, I should serve the country. When I arrive in Beijing, I will definitely ask to join the People's Navy and complete the task of liberating Taiwan."

　　东征厦门的水手英雄曾亦成
    他生长在海洋，依靠运输和打鱼为生，去年协助解放军渡海解放厦门岛。
    曾文经
    福建水手英雄曾亦成，在去年曾协助解放军渡海解放厦门岛。他头上两寸长三分宽的疤痕，就是在那次战役中受伤的光荣标志。
    他的故乡是在和厦门隔海相望的一个小岛上。他生长在海洋，经常来往厦门、台湾、福州、汕头、温州等地，依靠运输和渔捞为生。家乡解放前几天，他才从海上归来。
    他的家乡解放了。在一个群众会议上，他听说解放军需要船工帮助运粮、教战士开船，准备去打厦门和金门。他高兴极了。心里暗想：“在国民党统治下，船租捐税多么重呀！捞鱼运输，一过关卡就得被敲诈；征船抓夫，逼的民船不敢靠岸。现在呢，这一切都改变了。可是，如果凶恶的残匪仍然盘据厦门，船就没法出海，岛上人民就只有死路一条。”于是当场报名参加支援前线。会后并挨户去动员亲友来参加。在他的努力和影响下，二天之内，十七只船、五十二个人自动报名参加支前工作。在集中地点，他耐心地教解放军战士航海技术，而自己也开始受到革命的薰陶。
    解放厦门的命令下来了。曾亦成光荣地接受了输送部队登陆的任务。船工们为了坚定自己的信心，在出发前举行宣誓。不管遇着什么困难，都要把解放军送到对岸去。
    夜幕下沉，天空昏黑一片，只有星光微微地闪烁着。十时时分，海上风平潮退，数百只篷船从福建海岸扬帆驶向东方。曾亦成掌舵的那只船上，八十多个战士蜷伏在船的两旁，准备战斗。大陆上，我军用猛烈的炮火向厦门的敌军炮兵阵地轰击，敌人的碉堡也吐出稠密的火舌，双方的炮弹，就像流星一样，在黑漆的天空中穿梭交织。
    一会儿，四架敌机嗡嗡赶来，在空中盘旋侦察。突然四颗明晃晃的照明弹一闪，海上的空气顿时紧张起来。对岸敌军的探照灯也匆忙地发出耀眼的光芒，向广阔的黑暗的海面扫来扫去。敌军在碉堡里加紧集中火力向海上射击。震耳的枪炮声响成一团。炮弹飞落在船的四周，枪弹从头上身边嗖嗖飞过，穿透了船桅和船舱，帆篷几乎要变成碎片。曾亦成镇静地操纵着船舵和风篷，机智地把船左右躲闪，逃开探照灯的窥伺，像海燕一样地驶向厦门去。
    突然，一个飞弹从他的左边脑壳擦过，顿时鲜血涌出，他昏沉地靠卧在船旁，但心里还是清醒的。他想：假如把舵放松，在这激流和火网中，关系着八十多个战士的生命和厦门的解放。于是他继续紧紧地用右手撑住船舵。虽然他的助手已将他的伤口绑扎，但血仍涔涔流下，把上身的衣衫都湿透了。这时，五位战士移动过来，包围在他的左右，来保护他的安全。但他一定要战士避开。他想：打伤一位战士，解放厦门就减少一分力量。他咬着牙坚持下去，把船冲入敌人的阵地。
    我军涉水登陆了，但敌人仍在疯狂地反抗。双方在岸边展开了血战。机枪声，大炮声，我军冲锋的呼喊，敌人受伤的哀鸣……混成了一团。我军迅速突破铁丝网，夺取了滩头阵地，把手溜弹投入敌人的炮垒中，熊熊的火焰从炮口喷出来。解放军前仆后继的英勇战斗，更使他感奋起来，忘记了自己的重伤，自动把三架军用竹梯肩到岸上，把它架好，让战士们去攻取敌军盘据的小邱，控制制高点。然后又从船上搬运手榴弹递给在梯顶上的战士，好让他们去猛炸敌人的阵地。
    经过一番恶战后，我军兵员和弹药需要接济了，曾亦成便自告奋勇地负起这艰巨的任务，他一面撑舵，一面指挥扯篷，来往运兵运弹三次之多。
    当晨曦从东方海上升起的时候，我军已全部占领海边的敌军阵地。但高地仍在敌军手中，激烈的战斗仍在继续。曾亦成依然不顾劳苦和疼痛，利用地形把子弹由海边送到我军战壕里，一直坚持到厦门大部解放。由于流血过多，劳动过度，两天一夜没有睡觉，五餐没有进食，他昏倒了。
    厦门岛完全解放了。敌人全部被歼灭了。胜利的红旗在高地上飞舞飘扬。这时他被救护车接到医院疗治，在四个星期的疗养中，他深深感激解放军和人民政府亲切的照料。出院后，他马上要求继续支援前线，又担负起海上运输的重要任务。在工作中，他还通过朋友去动员二十一只帆船参加了支前运输，另外有三只商船也在他影响下，参加了支前的行列。在去年十月厦门庆功大会上，他被评为特等功臣。今年九月福建省召开英模代表大会，他代表泉州专区出席。现在又被选为福建省出席全国劳模代表会议的代表。
    在京沪的列车上，记者问他：“到北京去有什么感想呢？”他说：“我对福建台湾一带的海洋是熟悉的。台湾岛上各地，我也曾漂泊多年。现在要解放台湾，我是应该为国家效力的。我到北京，一定要求参加人民海军，完成解放台湾的任务。”
