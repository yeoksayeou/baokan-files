Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: This month, the 25th marks the first anniversary of the uprising of the former Kuomintang troops stationed in Xinjiang (now reorganized as the 22nd Corps of the People's Liberation Army). Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, currently in this city, issued a written speech at the request of the Political Department of the Xinjiang Military Region and the uprising troops. The speech began: "General Tao Zhiyue, General Zhao Xiguang, and all commanders and fighters of the 22nd Corps! I first extend my sincere congratulations to you. On this day last year, you held a solemn uprising, preserved Xinjiang, promoted the peaceful liberation of Xinjiang, and accelerated the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. Today marks the first full anniversary. In this year, you have devoted yourselves to production, undergone transformation, and wholeheartedly accepted the new education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, completing the first step of the transformation process. Today's flag-awarding ceremony is something our comrades should be immensely proud of."

The speech continued: "Facts have proven that the progress of all comrades during this period has been rapid, and the efforts to transform yourselves and transform the troops have achieved significant results. Perhaps some individual comrades have not kept up with the progress of the majority, and a very small number have unfortunately experienced accidents. However, generally speaking, unity, learning, and transformation have all shown good performance. This page of progress is the most memorable page in the life history of all comrades."

The speech further stated: "Comrades! This year's transformation has inevitably been painful, because all sincere transformations must go through painful struggles. However, because of this, we can be reborn and start anew; because of this, we can absorb new education, master new weapons in our thinking, and recognize new things; because of this, we have made considerable achievements in concrete practice. And precisely because of this, comrades are qualified and have the conditions to accept the glorious banner of the People's Liberation Army today."

The speech concluded: "Today, the situation in our New China is very different from when we met in Dihua. The conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has firmly and permanently united the people of the great socialist country, the Soviet Union, and the people of the newborn New Democratic Republic of China. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Economic Cooperation Agreement has established the brilliant prospects for Xinjiang's economic construction. These are all historical events that have occurred in our beloved Xinjiang and our beloved country since we parted. What does this illustrate? It tells us that with the help of our great ally, the Soviet Union, the cause of New China will begin step by step, and it will start from our Xinjiang. Under the conditions that have already been created, Xinjiang will be our future highly industrialized region, and it will undoubtedly be our defense base. The people's soldiers stationed in Xinjiang will strive for the dual mission of establishing New China's industrial base and defense base. This is a glorious task. I hope that comrades will continue to improve themselves, continue to move forward, patiently learn production skills, display a high degree of heroism, unite with the advanced troops of the First Corps, unite with the ethnic troops of the Fifth Army, unite with the people of Xinjiang, and jointly shoulder the major task of building a new Xinjiang."

　　原新疆部队起义周年纪念日
    张治中发表书面讲话
    号召不断进步团结一致建设新新疆
    【新华社二十五日讯】本月二十五日为原国民党驻新疆部队（现已改编为人民解放军二十二兵团）起义一周年纪念日。刻在此间的西北军政委员会副主席张治中应新疆军区政治部和起义部队之请，发表书面讲话。讲话首称：陶峙岳将军、赵锡光将军、第二十二兵团全体指战员同志们！我首先向你们致诚恳的祝贺。去年今日，你们举行了庄严的起义，保全了新疆，促成新疆的和平解放，加速了中国人民革命的胜利，今天刚刚满了一周年。在这一年中，你们投入了生产，进行了改造，全心全意接受了中国共产党、人民解放军的新的教育，走完了改造过程的第一步。今天举行的授旗典礼，是我们同志们应该引为无上光荣的。
    讲话继称：事实证明：各位同志在这一时期内的进步是很快的，改造自己、改造部队的努力是有显著成绩的。也许有个别同志还跟不上大家的进步，而且也还有极少的一部分发生了不幸的事故。不过，从总的方面说，团结、学习与改造都是有了很好的表现。这进步的一页是各位同志们生命史中最可纪念的一页。
    讲话又称：各位同志们！这一年的改造不免是痛苦的，因为凡是诚心的改造都一定要通过痛苦的斗争。但是，因为这样，我们才能够脱胎换骨，重新做人；因为这样，我们才能够吸取新的教育，在思想上掌握了新的武器，认识了新的事物；因为这样，我们才能够在具体实践上有了可观的成绩。也正因为这样，同志们今天才能够有资格有条件接受光辉的人民解放军的旗帜。
    讲话最后称：今天我们新中国的情况也和我们在迪化见面时大不相同了。中苏友好同盟互助条约的缔结，把伟大的社会主义国家——苏联的人民，和新生的新民主主义的中华人民共和国人民的力量坚固地、永久地团结起来了。中苏经济合作协定的订定，把新疆在经济建设上的辉煌远景确立起来了。这都是我们分别以后，在我们热爱的新疆，在我们热爱的国家里所发生的历史事业。这说明了什么呢？这告诉我们：在我们伟大的盟邦——苏联帮助之下，新中国的事业将要一步一步地开头，而且将从我们的新疆做起。在已经创设的条件之下，新疆将是我们未来高度工业化的地区，也无疑将是我们的国防基地。驻在新疆的人民战士将为了建立新中国的工业基地和国防基地的双重使命而奋斗。这是一份光荣的任务。我希望同志们今后不断提高自己，不断向前进步，耐心学习生产技能，发挥高度英雄气概，和先进部队第一兵团团结一致，和民族部队第五军团结一致，和新疆人民团结一致，共同地把建设新新疆的重大任务担负起来。
