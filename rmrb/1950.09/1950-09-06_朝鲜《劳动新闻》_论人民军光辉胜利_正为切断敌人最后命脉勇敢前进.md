Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 5th: The Korean Labor Party's central organ, the *Labor News*, published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "The Korean People's Army is Bravely Advancing to Cut Off the Enemy's Last Lifeline," stating: Our heroic People's Army forces are relentlessly eliminating the enemy. In a short period of two months, they have inflicted devastating blows on the enemy's main forces, compressing the U.S. military and the remnants of the Lee Seung-man puppet army into a corner of Gyeongsang North and South Provinces and launching the final annihilation battle.

　　Our heroic People's Army's various branches, with the active support of the people, are crossing the Nakdong River, which the enemy is desperately defending, and advancing towards the enemy's last strongholds of Daegu and Busan.

　　Our People's Army, with an overwhelming force, liberated the enemy's solid defense lines—Dabu-dong, Waegwan, Hyeonpung, and Uiseong. The enemy retreated everywhere, abandoning corpses and weapons. The People's Army forces on the southern coast, after defeating the enemy who stubbornly resisted by utilizing favorable geographical conditions and constructing solid defensive positions, liberated the enemy's important military strategic base and key defensive stronghold—Haman, and continued their offensive.

　　The editorial pointed out: The victorious achievements of the past two months prove that the resilience, bravery, and devotion to the motherland of our People's Army officers and soldiers are boundless. Our soldiers and commanders have made great contributions in crossing the Han River, Geum River, and Nakdong River, and victoriously marching towards the enemy's last strongholds, strengthening the confidence of the entire nation in victoriously ending this just war. Encouraged by the glorious victories of the People's Army, all the Korean people are determined to drive out the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops from the territory of our motherland. This is evidenced by the enthusiastic participation of all the Korean people in the signature campaign for the "Korean People's Declaration."

　　The editorial emphasized: The final stage of the battle is even more brutal. Now, the remaining enemy is attempting a final struggle. Facing death, the enemy is frantically resorting to more brutal methods, attempting to save their dying fate. We must never forget the enemy's various atrocities and must avenge this blood debt.

　　The editorial finally called on the people of the whole country to dedicate all their strength to support the front lines, relentlessly eliminate the enemy, and strive for final victory.

    论人民军光辉胜利
    正为切断敌人最后命脉勇敢前进
    【新华社平壤五日电】朝鲜劳动党中央机关报《劳动新闻》，三日以“朝鲜人民军为切断敌人的最后命脉而勇敢地前进着”为题，发表社论称：我们英勇的人民军部队、无情地消灭着敌人，在两个月的短时期内，已予敌人主力以歼灭性的打击，把美军和李承晚残余伪军压缩到庆尚南、北道的一隅、展开着最后的歼灭战。
    我们英勇的人民军各兵种部队，在人民的积极支援下，渡过敌人拚死防御的洛东江，向敌人的最后据点大邱、釜山前进。
    我们人民军以排山倒海之势，解放了敌人坚固的防御线——多富洞、倭馆、玄风、义兴，敌人到处抛弃死尸和武器而后退，南海岸方面的人民军部队，击破利用有利的地理条件，构筑坚固的防御阵地进行顽抗的敌人，解放了敌军事战略上的重要基地、敌人的重要防御据点——咸安后，继续在进攻。
    社论指出：两个月中的胜利战绩，证明了我们人民军官兵的强韧性、勇敢性和对祖国的献身性是无限的。我们的战士、指挥官在渡过汉江、锦江、洛东江，向敌人的最后据点胜利进军中，立下了伟大的功勋，使全国人民更加加强了胜利结束这一正义的战争的信心。全朝鲜人民在人民军的光辉胜利的鼓舞下，决心从祖国的疆土上赶走美帝国主义侵略军。这一点从全朝鲜人民踊跃地参加“朝鲜人民声明书”的签名运动，可以获得证明。
    社论强调：战斗到了最后阶段，是更加残酷的。现在，尚未消灭的敌人正企图作最后挣扎。面临死亡的敌人，疯狂地采取着更凶暴的方法，妄图挽救自己垂死的命运。我们永远不能忘记敌人的各种暴行，一定要讨还这笔血债。
    社论最后号召全国人民献出一切力量支援前线，无情地消灭敌人，争取最后的胜利。
