Editorial: Public-Private Partnership to Develop Foreign Trade

　　The basic problem in China's foreign trade work today is how to restore and develop foreign trade. To solve this problem, the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government convened a national import and export trade conference in July, which has made correct decisions on how to carry out foreign trade work. This is timely.
    Since the establishment of the Central People's Government, the foreign trade work of the new China has fundamentally changed the semi-colonial state of foreign trade work for a century, and has begun a new era of independence and self-reliance aimed at restoring and developing the national economy.
    After the Opium War, China's foreign trade had been serving imperialism. It was a tool to destroy China's economic life and hinder China's economic development, rather than a tool to protect China's economy. Such foreign trade has the following characteristics: First, the leadership of foreign trade, due to the loss of customs autonomy, the decision-making power of both export and import is in the hands of imperialists and their running dogs, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. Second, because of this, the counterparts of foreign trade are basically capitalist countries that exploit the Chinese people. Third, because of this, the imported goods are mainly consumer goods that hinder China's industrial development, rather than production tools and raw materials for industrial development, and the procurement of export goods also exploits farmers at low prices, so import and export are unfavorable to the Chinese people. Fourth, because of this, a long-term large import surplus is formed, and this trade balance must be compensated by foreign exchange.
    After the victory of the people's great revolution, a completely new situation has emerged in China's foreign trade. First, the initiative of foreign trade has been mastered by China itself. Due to the implementation of Articles 37 and 57 of the Common Program, "implementing the control of foreign trade and adopting protection trade policies" and "restoring and developing commercial and trade relations with the governments and peoples of various foreign countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit," the customs has become a tool to protect the national economy, rather than a tool for imperialist aggression against China. Second, the objects of foreign trade have changed. On the one hand, there are the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and the proportion of trade is increasing. On the other hand, capitalist countries that are willing to trade with us on the principle of equality and mutual benefit also have trade relations with us. Third, the import status, which is mainly non-essential daily necessities, has been fundamentally changed. In 1950, more than 90 percent of imported goods were production tools and necessary industrial raw materials. On the export side, the policy of protecting farmers has been implemented in the prices of agricultural products and agricultural by-products. Fourth, the state of long-term trade deficit has begun to change. The phenomenon of insufficient foreign exchange has begun to turn into a surplus of foreign exchange.
    However, China is a large country with a population of nearly 475 million, with an economy that is beginning to recover and abundant materials. The scale, strength and experience of the existing foreign trade are not commensurate with the needs of the country. On the one hand, agricultural products and agricultural by-products that should be exported have not been fully exported; on the other hand, there has also been a phenomenon of insufficient imports of industrial production tools and necessary raw materials. This means that the scale of our existing foreign trade needs to be expanded.
    One of the keys to developing foreign trade is to unite all public and private foreign trade forces, rectify the ranks of public and private foreign trade, and carry out foreign trade work in a coordinated manner. According to the situation in Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao and other ports in the first half of 1950, the proportion of public and private import and export trade, including the trade volume of public-owned entrusted private agency, is roughly half for each. It can be seen that private foreign trade is an important force in China's foreign trade today. Only when state-owned foreign trade organs cooperate well with private foreign trade merchants can the existing tasks of foreign trade be completed today.
    Under the leadership of the People's Government, the public and private foreign trade forces are basically united. The guidance and assistance of state-owned foreign trade to private foreign trade is generally good. However, in the coordination of public-private relations, there are still some shortcomings that need to be overcome in individual regions and individual departments. Some trade departments have not adopted a positive policy of uniting and transforming private import and export merchants, so there have been phenomena such as sometimes grasping foreign exchange approvals too tightly, restricting too much, setting unreasonable prices, squeezing out private import and export merchants, and competing with private import and export merchants. Some private import and export merchants have also neglected the overall interests of the country, and thus have violated the country's foreign trade policies and manipulated the market.
    The basic reasons for the above-mentioned deviations in state-owned foreign trade work are two: First, individual cadres did not correctly understand the state's policies, so they unilaterally emphasized the interests of state-owned trade, unilaterally took care of the interests of farmers, and did not comply with contracts. Second, some cadres lack experience in foreign trade work, so they are not very clear about many situations and the measures are not appropriate. After nearly a year of work, and after the discussion at this meeting, after the principles and policies have become clearer and the experience has been initially summarized, this situation will definitely change.
    On the private import and export merchant side, the shortcomings are basically due to the traditional profit-only ideology, looking at new problems with old eyes, seeking short-term interests and lacking foresight. After criticizing this ideological style, and after dividing the scope of operation, determining the methods of cooperation, and stipulating various specific measures in foreign trade, such as foreign exchange supply, contracting, etc., the situation should also change.
    Of course, since the state-owned economy is in a leading position, the state-owned foreign trade organs should bear the main responsibility for the occurrence and overcoming of these shortcomings.
    Foreign trade work is an important part of the new China's economic undertaking, and it has a very important task for the national economy. After this national import and export trade conference, the national public and private foreign trade forces will definitely be able to unite under the leadership of state-owned foreign trade and jointly strive to develop the new China's foreign trade.

### 公私合作，开展对外贸易

　　公私合作，开展对外贸易
    新中国今天对外贸易工作中的基本问题，是如何恢复与发展对外贸易问题。为了解决这一个问题，中央人民政府贸易部于七月中召开了全国进出口贸易会议，这个会议已经对于如何开展对外贸易工作，作出了正确的决定。这是切合时宜的。
    中央人民政府成立以来，新中国的对外贸易工作，已根本改变了百年来对外贸易工作中的半殖民地状态，开始了独立自主的、以恢复与发展国民经济为目的的新时期。
    鸦片战争以后，中国对外贸易，一直就是为帝国主义服务的。它是破坏中国经济生活，阻碍中国经济发展的工具，而不是保护中国经济的工具。这样的对外贸易有以下几个特点：第一，对外贸易的领导权，由于海关自主权的丧失，无论出口与入口的决定权均操在帝国主义及其走狗官僚资产阶级的手中。第二，因为这样，对外贸易的对手基本上都是剥削中国人民的资本主义国家。第三，因为这样，入口的商品以阻碍中国工业发展的消费品为主，而不是以发展工业用的生产工具与原料为主，出口商品的采购也以低价剥削农民，因此出入口对中国人民都有不利。第四，因为这样，形成长期的大量的入超，这个贸易差额，必须以外汇来弥补。
    在人民大革命胜利之后，新中国对外贸易已出现了完全新的情况。第一，对外贸易的主动权，已经由中国自己掌握。由于执行共同纲领第三十七条和第五十七条的规定，“实行对外贸易的管制，并采用保护贸易政策”，“在平等和互利的基础上，与各外国的政府和人民恢复并发展通商贸易关系”，海关已成为保护国家经济的工具，而不是帝国主义侵略中国的工具了。第二，对外贸易的对象已起了变化，一方面有了苏联和新民主主义各国，而且贸易的比重日益增大。另一方面，凡愿意根据平等和互利的原则与我进行贸易的资本主义国家，也与我有贸易关系。第三，以非必需的日用品为主的入口状态，已根本改变。一九五○年入口货中，百分之九十以上是生产工具和必要的工业原料。出口方面，则在收购农产与农业副产品的价格上，贯彻了保护农民的政策。第四，长期的贸易入超的状态已开始改变。外汇一向不足的现象，开始转为外汇有余了。
    但是，中国是一个近四万七千五百万人口的、经济上正在开始恢复的、物资丰富的大国，以现有的对外贸易的规模、力量和经验来说，都还与国家的需要不相适应。一方面应当出口的农业产品及农副业产品等还未曾充分出口；另一方面，也发生了工业生产工具及必要原料等入口不足的现象。这就是说，我们现有的对外贸易规模，还需要加以扩充。
    发展对外贸易的关键之一，就是团结一切公私对外贸易力量，整顿公私对外贸易的队伍，步调一致地进行对外贸易工作。根据一九五○年上半年天津、上海、青岛等海口的情况，公私营出入口贸易的比重，连公营委托私营代办的贸易额计算在内，大致是公私各占一半。由此可见，私营对外贸易是今天我国对外贸易中的一个重要力量，只有国营对外贸易机关与私营对外贸易商很好合作，才能完成今天已有的对外贸易的任务。
    在人民政府的领导下，公私营对外贸易力量之间，基本上是团结的。国营对外贸易对私营对外贸易的指导与帮助，一般也是好的。但在公私关系的协调上，在个别地区和个别部门中，还有一些需要克服的缺点。某些贸易部门对私营进出口商没有采取积极团结改造的方针，因而曾经发生对批准外汇有时抓得太紧，限制太多，价格规定得不合理，排挤私营进出口商，与私营进出口商相竞争等现象。一部分私营进出口商，也有忽视国家整体利益，因而发生违反国家对外贸易政策，操纵市场等现象。
    在国营对外贸易工作中，发生了上述偏差的基本原因有二：一、个别干部没有正确地了解国家的政策，以致片面强调国营贸易的利益，片面照顾农民利益以及不遵守合同等。二、某些干部对国外贸易工作的经验不足，因而对许多情况不甚明了，措施不尽适当。经过近一年来的工作，又经过这次会议的讨论，在方针政策已更加明白、经验有了初步总结之后，这种情况是一定会改变的。
    在私营进出口商方面，缺点之所以发生，基本上是由于传统的唯利是图的思想作风，以旧眼光来看新问题，图近利而缺乏远见。在批判了这种思想作风，而又划分了经营范围，决定了合作办法，规定了对外贸易中各种具体措施，如外汇供应，订定合同等办法之后，情况也应当有所改变。
    当然，由于国营经济居于领导地位，这些缺点的发生和克服应由国营对外贸易机关负主要的责任。
    对外贸易工作是新中国经济事业一个重要组成部分，它对国家经济负有非常重要的任务。在这次全国进出口贸易会议之后，全国公私对外贸易力量，一定能在国营对外贸易领导之下，团结一致，共同为开展新中国对外贸易而奋斗。
