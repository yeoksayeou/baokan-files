Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 9th. The Land Reform Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee is leading the entire region to intensify various preparatory works for land reform. In order to deeply understand the rural class relations and land occupation situation in various provinces, and to inspect and supervise the propaganda and education, cadre training, key experiments, and autumn rent reduction preparations in various places, the Committee dispatched more than 20 cadres to Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangdong and other provinces in early August for inspection. They will also participate in the key land reform experiments in various provinces in order to learn from work experience as a basis for guiding future work. At present, the propaganda work of the Land Reform Law in Central South China has begun to shift from cities to rural areas. More than 10,000 people in Wuhan City participated in land reform studies this time, and more than 1,200 people volunteered to register as voluntary propagandists to assist the government in carrying out propaganda in rural suburbs.

The rectification of Party member cadres and the training of a large number of rural cadres are also being intensified, and land reform work in typical villages has also begun. Land reform committees have been established or are being established in various provinces. The land reform committees of Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces are all formulating specific implementation measures in their respective provinces based on the Land Reform Law. The Land Reform Committee of Henan Province will also formulate a plan for land reform in the other half of the province this winter based on the experience of implementing land reform in 43 counties in the province this spring. The Land Reform Committee of Hunan Province, in collaboration with the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, has organized a land reform work team of more than 150 people to go to the countryside, dividing into Xiangyin County in the lake area, Changsha County in the hilly area, and Liuyang County in the mountainous area, selecting typical villages to conduct experiments. Special districts and counties in various provinces that will implement land reform this winter are also starting to establish land reform committees.

In order to strengthen the connection between land reform committees at all levels, communication and telephone links are being established from top to bottom. As of now, the Land Reform Committee of the Central South Region has opened long-distance telephone lines with the land reform committees of the five provinces except Guangxi. Various provinces are installing telephones directly connected to special districts and counties. For example, among the 21 counties in Hubei Province that will implement land reform this winter, 20 counties except Huanggang County have been connected; in Henan Province, only five counties have not yet been connected.

　　中南区加紧进行土改准备工作
    宣传政策、训练干部、调查农村阶级关系  各省土地改革委员会已经成立或即将成立
    【新华社汉口九日电】中南军政委员会土地改革委员会，正领导全区加紧进行土地改革的各项准备工作。该会为了深入了解各省农村阶级关系及土地的占有状况，并检查督促各地关于土地改革的宣传教育、训练干部、重点实验和秋季减租等准备工作，特派遣干部二十余人，于八月初旬分赴湖南、江西、广东等省巡视。他们并将参加各省的土地改革重点实验工作，以便吸取工作经验，作为指导今后工作的根据。目前，中南各地对于土地改革法的宣传工作已开始由城市转入农村。武汉市这次参加土地改革学习的共一万余人，其中一千二百余人自愿报名作义务宣传员，协助政府在郊区农村进行宣传。
    各地党员干部的整风，和大批乡村干部的训练工作也正加紧进行，典型乡村的土地改革工作也已开始。各省土地改革委员会或已经成立或正在成立。河南、湖南、江西三省土地改革委员会，都正依据土地改革法，拟制在各该省实施的具体施行办法。河南省的土地改革委员会并将根据今春该省四十三县实行土地改革的经验，拟制该省另一半地区今冬土地改革的方案。湖南省土地改革委员会已协同中共湖南省委，组织了一百五十余人的土地改革工作队下乡，分赴滨湖区的湘阴县、丘陵区的长沙县和山区的浏阳县，选择典型乡村进行实验。各省今冬实行土地改革的专区和县也正在着手建立土地改革委员会。
    为了加强各级土地改革委员会之间的联系，各地正在自上而下建立电讯和电话的联络。截至目前，中南区土地改革委员会已经和除广西而外的五个省的土地改革委员会架通了长途电话。各省正在架设和各专区和县直通的电话。如湖北省今冬实行土地改革的二十一个县中，除黄冈县以外的二十县都已经架通了；河南省也只有五个县还未架通。
