　　Following the U.S. Imperialist plan for Western European war preparations, the French Pleven government, following Britain, has announced that it will extend the term of military service from twelve months to eighteen months, in an attempt to solve the severe shortage of troops encountered in the process of expanding its aggressive army. According to Agence France-Presse, diplomatic and military circles in Washington have welcomed this. According to a United Press Paris dispatch, French Prime Minister Pleven, in a speech on the 2nd announcing this decision, could not but admit that building such a huge aggressive army would inevitably impose an unbearable burden on the French economy. Therefore, after saying that "our country cannot bear all the financial expenditures required" for war preparations, he said: "We will unashamedly ask other countries to provide this assistance."

　　At the same time, the Belgian Pholien government, another of America's Western European partners, also submitted a request to Congress on September 2nd for approval to extend the compulsory military service term from one year to two years.

　　奉行美帝的西欧备战计划
    法比政府延长兵役期限
    【新华社六日讯】法国普利文政府为奉行美国帝国主义制订的西欧备战计划，已继英国之后宣布将兵役年限由十二个月延长至十八个月，企图借此解决扩充侵略军队步骤中所遭遇的严重的兵员缺乏。据法新社报道，华盛顿外交及军事方面，对此已表示欢迎。据合众社巴黎消息，法总理普利文于二日宣布这一决定的演说中不能不承认建立这样庞大的侵略军必然要使法国经济受到不堪承当的负担，因此他在说到备战“所需的财政支出，我国无力全部承担”之后说：“我们要毫不引以为羞地要求别国给予这种援助。”。
    与此同时，美国的西欧小伙伴比利时的福廉政府亦已于九月二日向国会提出要求批准将强迫兵役期限由一年延长至两年。
