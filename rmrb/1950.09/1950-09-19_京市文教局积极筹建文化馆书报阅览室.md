    In order to further develop social education and improve the cultural life of the working people, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education has been actively preparing to build cultural centers and reading rooms in various districts since January. As of now, there are three newly built cultural centers about to open, bringing the total to twelve including the nine cultural centers from last year; there are twenty-one newly established reading rooms, bringing the total to twenty-eight including the seven reading rooms from last year.

    The three newly built cultural centers are: the Sixth Cultural Center located on Chaowai Avenue in the Tenth District, the Seventh Cultural Center located at Xinjiekou in the Fourth District, and the Eighth Cultural Center located at Dashiqiao in the Seventh District. The newly built reading rooms (Eighth to Twenty-eighth Reading Rooms) are distributed as follows: two in the First District; one in the Second District; two in the Fourth District; one in the Fifth District; one in the Seventh District; three in the Eighth District; one in the Ninth District; two in the Tenth District; one in the Eleventh District; one in the Twelfth District; one in the Thirteenth District; two in the Fourteenth District; one in the Fifteenth District; and two in the Sixteenth District. Among the above twenty-one reading rooms, the Eighth to Fourteenth Reading Rooms and the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Reading Rooms, a total of nine reading rooms, have already opened one after another, while the remaining twelve reading rooms are actively repairing houses and purchasing supplies, and will open as soon as preparations are completed.

    To date, the Bureau of Culture and Education's plan to establish cultural centers in 1950 has been fully completed. The remaining thirteen reading rooms that have not been completed are actively planning addresses in the First, Fourth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Districts, and strive to complete the entire plan by the end of the year.
