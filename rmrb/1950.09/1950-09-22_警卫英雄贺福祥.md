　　Guard Hero He Fuxiang
　　By our reporter Zhu Bo
    Comrade He Fuxiang, a representative of the security heroes attending the National Congress of Combat Heroes, is currently the company commander of a certain unit of the Central Column of the Public Security Forces. Since joining the revolution in 1933, he has been tempered into a steel-like fighter through seventeen years of Party cultivation. He has consistently demonstrated boundless loyalty to the Party, a responsible attitude towards his work, and a spirit of hard work and endurance. As early as the Red Army period, he received material rewards from the unit for his bravery in combat. During the Yan'an period, he was selected as a labor hero, a model student, and a special-class training hero of the regiment. In 1949, he was honorably selected as a special-class security model of the division and received a certificate of honor from the Beijing Public Security Bureau. In August of this year, he was selected as a representative of the security heroes to attend the National Congress of Combat Heroes.
    Comrade He Fuxiang is from Baijiapan Village, Qingjian County, Shaanxi Province. He had a stubborn personality from a young age. When he was a child, his father wanted to sell his younger sister because of poverty. He resolutely opposed this, arguing with his parents. His mother said, "If you don't let us sell your little sister, can you support her? You don't even have enough to eat! What can we do when we are so poor!" His mother cried as she spoke, and he also shed tears sadly. From then on, he began to feel incomparable hatred for the old society.
    From the age of thirteen, He Fuxiang followed his father and elder brother to work for Bai Yunsi, a landlord in Baijiapan, Qingjian County. He saw the landlord effortlessly taking away the grain his family had harvested, and saw the landlord's children often bullying and beating his brother and himself. In particular, the landlord Bai Yunsi's wife was never satisfied with any service, and a day's hard work for the landlord resulted in a scolding and a hungry family. His father and brother could endure these things, but he was unwilling to endure them, often arguing with the landlord, even shouting back. His mother did not know how many gifts she had given to the landlord to apologize for him. Once, in order to keep the land they were farming from the landlord, his mother bought some pork to give to the landlord as a gift. He Fuxiang disagreed no matter what, but his mother finally sent it to the landlord, which made him so angry that he refused to eat or drink for four days. The whole family was worried and cried. Later, his second uncle persuaded him, and the matter was finally dropped. Whenever He Fuxiang was mentioned, his mother always said, "What a stubborn child! Just like an ox!"
    In the spring of 1933, when Comrades Liu Zhidan and Gao Gang were pioneering the Shaanxi-Gansu border area, Comrade He Fuxiang participated in the underground Communist Youth League activities in his village. Under the leadership of the CCP branch, he bravely fought against the landlords and counter-revolutionary armed forces with other comrades. At that time, Qingjian County was still ruled by counter-revolutionary armed forces, and the enemy carried out a frenzied massacre of Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. However, He Fuxiang and other comrades did not waver or fear in the slightest, and their struggle became even more tenacious and fierce. They posted Communist Party slogans everywhere, and even Communist Party leaflets appeared in the Kuomintang bandit army's headquarters. At night, slogans such as "Down with the Japanese invaders and landlords" were heard everywhere, forcing the Kuomintang bandit army to flee with its tail between its legs. On the third day after the Kuomintang bandit army ran away from Qingjian, the Red Army led by Comrades Liu Zhidan and Gao Gang arrived in the area, cleaned up the nearby militia (landlord armed forces), and led the local peasants to struggle against the local despotic landlords. Later, when the Red Army set off, the nineteen-year-old He Fuxiang followed the Pioneer Company of the 3rd Regiment of the 42nd Division of the Red Army. Without prior approval from the unit, and because of his small physique, the unit did not want him, but he followed anyway, all the way to Anding County. The Pioneer Company commander had no choice but to send him to the Red Army Headquarters and hand him over to Comrade Liu Zhidan for processing, and introduced He Fuxiang's situation to the military headquarters. At that time, Comrade Liu Zhidan was not there, only Comrade Gao Gang was in the military headquarters. "Why don't you leave?" Comrade Gao Gang asked him after listening to the report from the Pioneer Company commander. "I want to join the Red Army," Comrade He Fuxiang quickly replied. At this time, Comrade Zhidan happened to return from outside and heard him say that he wanted to join the Red Army, and then asked, "Do you know what the Red Army does?" "Who doesn't know that the Red Army is for the poor?" Comrade Fuxiang was a little unhappy at the time, and asked Comrade Zhidan in return. Comrade Zhidan smiled and looked at Comrade Fuxiang very kindly. Finally, Comrade Fuxiang repeated the circumstances of his participation in the Communist Youth League and his struggle against the landlords and counter-revolutionary armed forces. In this way, Comrade Liu Zhidan approved his enlistment.
    At that time, the counter-revolutionary armed forces in northern Shaanxi far outnumbered the Red Army, and the Red Army's weapons were not as good as the enemy's, and there was no place to supply ammunition. Although life was so difficult, the Red Army's fighting spirit was always high. At that time, because there were no weapons, He Fuxiang carried a large machete on his back, jumping around everywhere. In every battle, he demonstrated the heroic and tenacious spirit of a people's fighter. Once, the Pioneer Company, in coordination with several other companies, encircled and annihilated a cavalry company of Ma Hongkui. Comrade He Fuxiang suffered a serious head injury and was covered in blood, but he still persisted in fighting to the end. Another time, when attacking the county town of Yanchang, the comrades scrambled to be in the assault team. Finally, with the approval of the higher authorities, He Fuxiang was the fourth member of the assault team. When he started to climb the city, he quickly rushed to the front of the third assault team member. Due to his bravery and agility, he quickly captured a bunker, allowing the troops to smoothly enter the city and annihilate an entire battalion of Kuomintang bandit troops. In this battle, Comrade He Fuxiang captured the then-Yanchang puppet county magistrate alive.
    From 1934 to 1935, the Kuomintang launched hundreds of thousands of counter-revolutionary armed forces to continuously carry out three encirclement and suppression campaigns against the Shaanxi-Gansu border Soviet area, all of which were crushed by the Red Army. Comrade He Fuxiang demonstrated unparalleled bravery and tenacity in every battle against the encirclement and suppression campaigns, and therefore received rewards from the unit. In 1934, Comrade He Fuxiang, who had been tested by war, honorably joined the Communist Party of China.
    In October 1935, the Central Red Army victoriously joined forces with the Northern Shaanxi Red Army. At the same time, the Soviet Central Government at that time also moved to Northern Shaanxi. Comrade He Fuxiang was assigned to the Communications Company of the Central Military Commission as a communicator, and also shouldered the task of security work together with other guards.
    Since 1942, Comrade He Fuxiang was transferred to the Central Guard Regiment and honorably became a guard fighter for Chairman Mao, and has been ever since. Comrade He Fuxiang never considered personal gains or losses in his work. In security work, he has demonstrated exceptional vigilance, steadiness, bravery, and a high degree of love for the leader. Because Comrade He Fuxiang clearly understands that cherishing the leader is cherishing our country.
    In 1947, Hu Zongnan's hundreds of thousands of bandit troops began to attack Yan'an, the sacred place of the people's revolution. The Party Central Committee, headed by Chairman Mao, temporarily left Yan'an in order to more conveniently eliminate Hu Zongnan's bandit troops. Chairman Mao led the Northwest People's Liberation Army to eliminate Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, persisted in the Northern Shaanxi War, and directed the entire country, deploying a major counter-offensive. At this time, He Fuxiang and other comrades in the guard company were working nervously for Chairman Mao's safety. Every comrade was thinking that, for Chairman Mao's safety, they were ready to sacrifice their lives at any time. During this period, the places where the troops were active were often only sixty or seventy li away from the enemy, or even only ten or twenty li away. Once, because Hu Zongnan's bandit troops were approaching, we had to march in the rain at night. When climbing a high mountain, we lost our way. Many comrades were sent out to search everywhere, but they could not find a way for a long time. However, on the mountain behind us, Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops lit piles of bonfires. If we waited until dawn to leave, it would be very dangerous. Everyone was very anxious. Comrade He Fuxiang used the method of listening for movement on the ground and heard one or two barks of a dog in the distance. So, he walked in the direction of the dog's barking and found an old man who led the troops to their destination. Another time, when we arrived near Bailong Temple in Jia County, not far from Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, the crisp sound of rifles rang out continuously. This was the rear troops making contact with the enemy. At this time, we should quickly protect Chairman Mao to a safe place, but a torrent of rushing water in the Jialu River blocked our way. At that time, Comrade He Fuxiang heroically swam across Heilongtan with other guards, quickly came up with a way to build a bridge, and safely led Chairman Mao across to a safer area. In the security work, Comrade He Fuxiang sometimes stood sentry for six or seven hours in a row, demonstrating a tenacious spirit of hard work and endurance.
    Comrade He Fuxiang's alertness and bravery were not only reflected in his security work, but also in other various tasks. When following Chairman Mao, Comrade He Fuxiang, in addition to his security tasks, sometimes shouldered reconnaissance tasks because of his familiarity with the terrain in northern Shaanxi. Once, Hu Zongnan's bandits came out to sweep with two brigades. That night, we received information that some people said they had retreated, while others said that the enemy had not retreated. In the end, Comrade He Fuxiang was sent to reconnaissance. He reconnoitered all the way to the village where the enemy had been before he found out that the enemy had really retreated.
    In 1949, Beijing was liberated, and the whole country basically achieved victory. After entering Beijing, the social situation became more complicated and the security work became even more important. Comrade He Fuxiang has raised his vigilance even higher. He recognizes that today's situation is even more complex than it was in northern Shaanxi. Therefore, he is even more conscientious in his work, and will not be careless even about a small, trivial matter.

　　警卫英雄贺福祥
    本报记者  朱波
    出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的保卫英雄代表贺福祥同志，现任公安部队中央纵队某部连长。从一九三三年参加革命以来，经过党的十七年的培养，使他锻炼成钢铁似的战士。他一贯表现了对党无限忠实；工作负责及吃苦耐劳的精神。早在红军时期，因为他在战斗中的英勇，即曾得到部队的物质奖励，在延安时期曾被选为团的劳动英雄、学习模范及特等练兵英雄。一九四九年又光荣的被选为师的特等保卫模范，并获得北京市公安局的荣誉奖状。今年八月被选为出席全国战斗英雄会议的保卫英雄代表。
    贺福祥同志是陕西清涧县白家畔村人。从小就具有一种倔强的性格。幼年时，他父亲因生活困苦要把他的小妹妹卖给人家，他对这件事坚决反对，和父母吵闹，他母亲说：“你不叫卖小妹妹，你能养活住她吗？连你吃的都没有！咱家穷有啥法呢！”母亲说着就哭了，他也难过的流出了眼泪。从此在他思想上即开始对旧社会发生无比的痛恨。
    十三岁起，贺福祥就随着父亲和哥哥，给清涧县白家畔地主白云思种地。他看到地主毫不费力的把他家收种的粮食抢走，看到地主家孩子经常对哥哥和他自己的欺侮打骂，特别是地主白云思的老婆，怎么侍奉也不能如她的意，一天辛辛苦苦的为地主做活，换来的是一顿臭骂，换来的是全家饥饿。这些，在他父亲、哥哥都能忍耐着，但他可就不愿忍耐，常常和地主闹、甚至对骂。他母亲不知为他向地主赔过多少礼。有一次他母亲为了能保住种地主的地，买了一些猪肉给地主送礼，贺福祥无论如何不同意，但他母亲终于给地主送去了，气得他一连四天不吃不喝，一家人愁的光哭，后来还是他二叔左说右劝，才把这件事情放过去。一提起贺福祥来，他母亲总是说：“多倔强的孩子呀！真像一头牛！”
    一九三三年的春天，正是刘志丹、高岗等同志开创陕甘边区的时候，贺福祥同志参加了本村地下的共产主义青年团活动。在中共支部的领导下，他很勇敢的随着其他同志向地主及反革命武装进行斗争。当时清涧县因为还是反革命武装统治着，敌人对共产党员及共青团员进行疯狂的屠杀。但是贺福祥和其他同志丝毫没有动摇或恐惧，而且斗争的更顽强更激烈了。他们到处贴共产党的标语，甚至在国民党匪军连部里也出现了共产党的传单。黑夜里，到处是“打倒日军、地主”的口号声，使国民党匪军不得不夹起尾巴逃走。就在国民党匪军从清涧跑走的第三天，刘志丹、高岗同志率领下的红军到达了当地，收拾了附近的民团（地主武装），领导当地农民把恶霸地主也斗争了。后来红军开拔时，十九岁的贺福祥也就随着红军四十二师三团先锋连走了。预先没有经过部队同意，他的身体又小，部队不要他，不要他也跟着，一直到了安定县。先锋连连长对他没办法，就将他送到红军司令部里，交给刘志丹同志处理。并将贺福祥的情形介绍给军部。当时刘志丹同志不在，只有高岗同志在军部里。“你为什么不走？”高岗同志听了先锋队长的报告后问他。“我要参加红军。”贺福祥同志很快的回答说。这时候赶巧志丹同志从外面回来，听见他说要参加红军，接着就问：“你知道红军是干什么的？”“谁不知道红军是为穷人的？”福祥同志当时有些不高兴，就这样反过来问志丹同志。志丹同志笑了，很亲切的注视着福祥同志。最后福祥同志又把参加共青团及向地主、反革命武装斗争的情形说了一遍，就这样刘志丹同志批准他入伍了。
    当时陕北的反革命武装力量远远超过红军，红军的武器又不如敌人，弹药没地方供给。虽然生活那样艰苦，但红军的战斗情绪始终是高涨的。那时因为没有武器，贺福祥背着一把大砍刀，到处蹦蹦跳跳。每次战斗，都表现了一个人民战士的勇猛顽强的气概。有一次先锋连配合着另外的几个连队，围歼马鸿逵的一个骑兵连，贺福祥同志的头部负了重伤，流的满身是鲜血，但是他仍然坚持战斗到最后。还有一次攻打延长县城，同志们都抢着当突击队，最后经上级批准贺福祥为突击队第四名。开始登城时，他很快就冲到第三名突击队员前边去了。由于他的勇敢、行动敏捷，很快的攻下了一个碉堡，使部队顺利的攻入城内，消灭了国民党匪军的一个整营。这次战斗中，贺福祥同志活捉了当时的延长伪县长。
    从一九三四年至一九三五年，国民党发动数十万反革命武装对陕甘边苏区连续进行三次围剿，均被红军粉碎了。贺福祥同志在反围剿的每次战斗中，都表现出无比的勇敢和顽强，因此获得了部队的奖励。一九三四年，经过战争考验的贺福祥同志，光荣的参加了中国共产党。
    一九三五年的十月，中央红军胜利的和陕北红军会师了，与此同时，当时的苏维埃中央政府也转移到陕北。贺福祥同志被分配到中央军委通讯连当通讯员，还和其他警卫人员一起担负着保卫工作的任务。
    从一九四二年以来，贺福祥同志调到中央警备团，光荣的成为毛主席的警卫战士，一直到现在。贺福祥同志在工作中从不计较个人的得失。在警卫工作中，表现得特别机警、稳重、勇敢及高度的热爱领袖的精神。因为贺福祥同志清楚的懂得爱护领袖就是爱护我们的国家。
    一九四七年，胡宗南的数十万匪军开始向人民革命圣地延安进攻了，以毛主席为首的党中央，为了更便利消灭胡匪军，暂时离开了延安。毛主席领导着西北人民解放军，消灭蒋胡匪军，坚持陕北战争。并指挥全国，布置大反攻。这时贺福祥和警卫连其他同志，都在为毛主席的安全而紧张的工作着。每个同志都在想，为了毛主席的安全，随时准备把自己的性命献出来。在这一时期，部队活动的地方经常只离敌人六、七十里路甚至一、二十里路的远近。有一次由于胡匪军逼近了，不得不在夜里冒雨行军，爬上一座高山时，就迷失了路，派出很多同志四处去摸，很久也找不出一条路来，但在后面的山头上，蒋胡匪军燃起了一堆一堆的大火，如果等到天亮了再走，那是很危险的。大家都非常着急，贺福祥同志用贴在地面上听动静的办法，听出远远有一两声狗叫，于是向着狗叫的方向走去，结果找到一位老汉，领着部队达到目的地。又一次行至葭县白龙庙附近，距离胡匪军不远，清脆的步枪声连续不断的响着，这是后面的部队和敌人接触上了。这时应很快的保卫毛主席至安全的地方，但葭芦河的一道湍激的洪水挡住去路，当时贺福祥同志随着其他警卫人员英勇的泅过黑龙潭，很快想法架桥，使毛主席安全渡过去，转向较安全的地带。在警卫工作中，贺福祥同志有时一连站六、七小时的哨，具有顽强的吃苦耐劳精神。
    贺福祥同志的机警、勇敢，还不只是表现在警卫工作中，而且表现在其他各种工作上。在随从毛主席时，贺福祥同志除去警卫任务外，因为他对陕北地形的熟悉，有时还担负着侦察任务。有一次胡匪以两个旅的兵力出来扫荡，当天晚上得到的情况，有人说退走了，有人说敌人还没有退走，最后还是派贺福祥同志去侦察，一直侦察到敌人到过的村子里，才弄清敌人真正退走了。
    一九四九年，北京解放了，在全国基本获得了胜利。进京以后，社会情况更加复杂，保卫工作更加重大了。贺福祥同志，警惕性提的更高了，他认识了今天的情况比在陕北时更复杂。因此，他在工作中表现得更加兢兢业业，那怕是一件细微的小事，也不会马虎的。
