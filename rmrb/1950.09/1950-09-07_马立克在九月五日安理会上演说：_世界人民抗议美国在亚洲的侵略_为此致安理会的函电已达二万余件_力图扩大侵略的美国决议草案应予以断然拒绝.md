(Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 6th) TASS, New York, September 6th: After the start of the Security Council meeting on September 5th, Chairman Jebb (British representative) called the attention of the member states to four documents received by the Security Council. The first document was a note from the United States regarding the downing of an aircraft off the coast of Korea, which allegedly contained Soviet pilots; the second document was the U.S. note of September 2, which included MacArthur's report on the military situation; the third document was the Soviet draft resolution on the bombing of Chinese territory; the fourth document was the Soviet draft resolution condemning armed aggression against Taiwan. Jebb proposed discussing these documents when the Security Council discussed the items on the provisional agenda and asked for the agenda to be adopted. At this point, Malik advocated the adoption of the provisional agenda, pointing out that a large number of letters and telegrams demanding an end to American aggression against Korea were flooding the Security Council. Malik recounted his statement of August 25 (when he cited the many protests he had received against American aggression), stating that since then he had received more than 8,000 more letters and telegrams from many countries—totaling more than 20,000. Malik cited letters and telegrams from the governments of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and other countries, from trade unions in Poland, France, and other countries, from the Women's International Democratic Federation, and from French textile workers, all denouncing American aggression as violating the Korean people's right to self-determination and undermining the provisions of the United Nations Charter. Malik also cited letters from American prisoners of war in North Korean prisoner-of-war camps, demanding an end to the senseless bloodshed in Korea.
　　The Security Council then adopted three provisional agenda items without dissent: first, the case of condemning aggression against the Republic of Korea; second, the case of condemning armed intervention against Taiwan; and third, the case of condemning the air force bombing of Chinese territory. Chairman Jebb invited Chang Myon, the representative of the Syngman Rhee group, to attend. U.S. Representative Austin read a letter that had been submitted to Secretary-General Lie, which said that a plane believed to be carrying Soviet citizens had been shot down. Austin also said that the United States had no further information about the incident. He asserted that this incident proved that the draft resolution submitted by the United States on July 31 was in dire need of adoption (as everyone knows, the content of this draft resolution is a condemnation of North Korea), allegedly to "localize" the Korean conflict. Austin cited the U.S. draft resolution section by section, and insisted that the Soviet Union seemed to be attempting to "aggravate tensions" between the People's Republic of China and countries supporting American aggression. At this point, Jebb pointed out that the Security Council currently had three draft resolutions on the Korean issue—the U.S. draft resolution, the Soviet draft resolution calling for a peaceful solution to the Korean situation, and the Soviet draft resolution on the bombing of peaceful residents. After the debate, the Security Council could first vote on the U.S. draft resolution and then on the two Soviet draft resolutions. Jebb asked if everyone was satisfied with this procedure. Egyptian representative Fawzi and Norwegian representative Sunde agreed to Jebb's proposal. However, Malik reminded everyone of the fundamental differences between the U.S. draft resolution and the Soviet draft resolution. He said that the U.S. draft resolution continued the aggression against Korea and tried to find a legitimate reason for it, while the Soviet draft resolution aimed at a rapid and peaceful solution to the Korean issue. When Malik spoke of the Soviet draft resolution on the bombing of peaceful residents in Korea, he said that the Soviet representative hoped that it would be discussed first, because this draft resolution concerned the lives of millions of people suffering from the barbaric bombing by the United States, and the issue was extremely urgent. He said that this procedure was the most practical, the most humane, and the most in line with the urgency of the situation. Indian representative Rau asked for each draft resolution to be debated separately, regardless of priority. Jebb proposed that, before deciding on the order, the Security Council should first vote on whether to debate the three draft resolutions separately or together. Soviet representative Malik objected, saying that such a vote was meaningless, because the Soviet draft resolution on the bombing of peaceful residents could be regarded as another issue and should be discussed separately, while the other two draft resolutions should be discussed together.
　　Egyptian representative Fawzi affirmed that he would feel "embarrassed" if any resolution other than the U.S. draft resolution were discussed immediately, because he was not yet prepared to discuss the Soviet draft resolution. French representative Chauvel then delivered a brief speech, expressing support for the U.S. draft resolution, which would deepen and prolong the Korean War, and opposing the Soviet draft resolution, which aimed at a peaceful solution to the Korean situation. While opposing the Soviet proposal, Chauvel openly opposed inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue. Norwegian representative Sunde also followed the U.S. policy, expressing support for the U.S. draft resolution. Next, Malik spoke. He said that Austin's previous speech was a provocative statement made on behalf of MacArthur and the U.S. Department of the Army. He said that the purpose of Austin's launching this provocative behavior was to facilitate the implementation of the task of the U.S. draft resolution—to expand the conflict. Malik declared that the U.S. draft resolution attempted to conceal and justify the aggression launched by the U.S. government in Korea. However, the whole world has understood that the heroic people of Korea are fighting against the American aggressors at the cost of sacrifice, using Korean-made weapons, weapons seized from the Japanese, or weapons seized from the defeated Syngman Rhee army and the U.S. military.
　　Truman's so-called "police action" is a large-scale aggression involving 70,000 to 100,000 U.S. troops, and no one can doubt this. This is a war of aggression launched by the United States and supported by the colonial countries of Europe against the people of Korea and other countries in Asia. Malik declared: The bombing of peaceful villages and towns in both North and South Korea by the United States can prove this. He also declared: It is now time to end the false propaganda of the United States that the United States is only fighting against North Korea. Malik pointed out: More than 13 million Korean people (including both North and South Korea) have jointly issued a statement denouncing the U.S. armed intervention and the barbaric attacks on the Korean people. Malik declared: It is the responsibility of the Security Council to take immediate steps to peacefully resolve the Korean issue. Malik pointed out: The Korean people hate American aggression, protest American actions, and demand that the United States stop its bloody aggression. Malik said: Although the United States hypocritically pretends to oppose the "expansion" of armed conflict in its draft resolution, it is precisely the policy of the United States that is responsible for the aggression and the Korean war. Malik further pointed out: American aggression undermines the fundamental principle of the United Nations Charter against aggression and recognizing national self-determination. Malik continued: The people of Asia believe that the aggression against Korea endangers their freedom and independence.
　　All of this shows that the people of the world resolutely protest the aggression launched by the United States. On the other hand, Malik emphasized the firm support of the Asian people and their governments (including the People's Republic of China and the Mongolian People's Republic) for the Soviet proposal. He pointed out that India also supports a peaceful solution to the Korean issue, as can be seen from the efforts of Indian Prime Minister Nehru. He said: This makes the Asian people know that the Soviet Union advocates peace, freedom, and independence, while the United States advocates wars of aggression. American soldiers, including blacks who are subjected to racial discrimination, are not fighting for freedom, but for the American monopoly capital to enslave the Asian people. The claim that the United States is acting in accordance with the United Nations resolution is also refuted by the following facts: The United States is putting the United Nations before a fait accompli. People all over the world, including the American people, demand an immediate end to American aggression in Asia. All people of goodwill in the world support Stalin's reply to Nehru's statement on the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. This statement reflects the Soviet Union's peace policy, which can also be seen in the draft resolution submitted by the Soviet Union to the Security Council. Malik concluded: The U.S. draft resolution should be resolutely rejected because it seeks to expand aggression. After Malik's speech was translated, the Security Council adjourned and reconvened on September 6.

　　马立克在九月五日安理会上演说：
    世界人民抗议美国在亚洲的侵略
    为此致安理会的函电已达二万余件
    力图扩大侵略的美国决议草案应予以断然拒绝
    【新华社六日讯】塔斯社纽约六日讯：九月五日安理会会议开始后，主席杰伯（英国代表）要各会员国注意安理会接到的四项文件。第一项文件是美国的一项照会，谈及在朝鲜海岸外击落一架飞机的事件，据说飞机内有苏联飞行员；第二项文件为九月二日美国的照会，内中有麦克阿瑟关于军事形势的报告；第三项文件为苏联关于中国领土受到轰炸一事提出的决议草案；第四项文件为苏联提出的控诉武装侵略台湾的决议草案。杰伯提议在安理会讨论临时议程上的各项问题时再讨论这些文件，并要求通过议程。在这一点上，马立克主张通过临时议程，他指出，要求终止美国对朝鲜侵略的函电，大量向安理会涌来。马立克追述他八月二十五日的声明（当时他引证了所收到的许多反对美国侵略的抗议）称，自从那时以来，他又收到了八千多件来自许多国家的函电——共计已达两万件以上。马立克引证来自保加利亚、罗马尼亚、匈牙利及其他国家的政府，来自波兰、法国及其他国家的职工会，来自世界民主妇联、法国纺织工人的函电，都痛斥美国的侵略侵犯了朝鲜人民的自决权利，破坏了联合国宪章的条款。马立克又引证北朝鲜俘虏营中美国战俘的来信，要求停止在朝鲜的无谓的流血。
    安理会继即无异议地通过三项临时议程：第一，控诉对大韩民国的侵略案，第二，控诉对台湾的武装干涉案，第三，控诉空军轰炸中国领土案。主席杰伯请李承晚集团的代表张勉列席。美国代表奥斯汀宣读一项已向秘书长赖伊提出的信件，这封信中说有一架据说载有苏联公民的飞机被击落。奥斯汀并说，关于这一事件，美国尚无更多的情报。他断言，这一事件证明了，美国在七月三十一日提出的决议草案实在是极需通过的（大家知道，这一决议草案的内容是对于北朝鲜的控诉），据说这是为了要使朝鲜冲突“局部化”。奥斯汀逐段引证美国的决议草案，并且坚持说，苏联似乎企图使中华人民共和国和支持美国侵略的国家之间的“紧张关系加剧”。杰伯至此指出，安理会当前有三个关于朝鲜问题的决议草案——美国的决议草案，要求和平解决朝鲜形势的苏联决议草案以及关于轰炸和平居民的苏联决议草案。辩论结束之后，安理会即可首先表决美国的决议草案，然后再表决苏联的两个决议草案。杰伯询问大家对这程序是否满意。埃及代表法齐和挪威代表森德赞成杰伯的提议。然而马立克提醒大家注意美国的决议草案和苏联决议草案之间存在着基本分歧。他说，美国的决议草案在继续对朝鲜的侵略，并强为此事觅得正当的理由，而苏联的决议草案则旨在迅速获致朝鲜事件的和平解决。马立克说到苏联提出的关于轰炸朝鲜和平居民的决议草案时说，苏联代表提出这个决议草案时，希望能首先被讨论，因为这个决议草案事关受美国的野蛮轰炸祸害的千百万人民的生命，问题至为迫切。他说，这种程序最切合实际，最合乎人情，也最符合局势的迫切情况。印度代表劳氏要求分别辩论每一决议草案，无分先后。杰伯提议，在决定先后之前，安理会应首先表决要分别辩论的这三个决议草案，还是一起来进行。苏联代表马立克提出反对，他说，这样的表决是毫无意义的，因为苏联提出的关于轰炸和平居民的决议草案，可以算作是另外一个问题，应该分开来讨论，至于其他的两个决议草案，便应该放在一块讨论。
    埃及代表法齐肯定说，假如马上讨论美国决议草案以外的任何决议案的话，他会感到“尴尬”，因为他还没有准备讨论苏联的决议草案。法国代表萧维尔继起作了简短的演说，表示支持会加深与延长朝鲜战争的美国决议草案，而反对旨在和平解决朝鲜局势的苏联决议草案。萧维尔在反对苏联建议案同时，公然反对邀请中国人民政府的代表参加解决朝鲜问题的讨论。而挪威代表森德也追随美国的方针，表示拥护美国的决议草案。其次是马立克发言。他说，奥斯汀前此的发言，乃是代表麦克阿瑟与美国陆军部而作的挑衅性的声明。他说，奥斯汀所以要发动这种挑衅行为，目的在便利实行美国决议草案的任务——扩大冲突。马立克宣称，美国决议草案企图掩饰和辩护美国政府在朝鲜所发动的侵略。但是，全世界都已经明白，朝鲜的英勇人民用朝鲜制造的武器，用缴获日本人的武器，或者用夺自溃败的李承晚军与美军的武器，不惜牺牲与美国侵略者进行斗争。
    杜鲁门从前所谓的“警察行动”，就是出动美军七万至十万人的一次大规模侵略，这一点是任何人也不会怀疑的了。这是一次由美国发动，而由欧洲各殖民国家支持的反对朝鲜及亚洲其他各国人民的侵略战争。马立克宣称：由美国轰炸南北朝鲜两地区的和平村庄和城镇一事，即可以证明这事。他又宣称：现在应该是结束美国所说美国仅对北朝鲜作战的虚伪宣传的时候了。马立克指出：一千三百多万朝鲜人民（南北朝鲜都包括在内）已联名发表了一项声明书，痛斥美国的武装干涉及对朝鲜人民的野蛮攻击。马立克宣称：立即采取步骤和平解决朝鲜问题，是安理会的责任。马立克指出：朝鲜人民痛恨美国的侵略，抗议美国的行动，要求美国停止血腥侵略。马立克说：美国虽然在其决议草案中假仁假义地装作反对武装冲突之“扩大”，但应负侵略及朝鲜战事的责任的，却正是美国的政策。马立克进而指出：美国的侵略破坏了反对侵略并承认民族自决权的联合国宪章的基本原则。马立克继称：亚洲人民认为对朝鲜的侵略，危害了他们的自由和独立。
    这一切都表明，世界人民坚决抗议美国所发动的侵略。另一方面，马立克着重指出亚洲人民和他们的政府（包括中国人民政府和蒙古人民共和国在内）对苏联建议的坚决支持。他指出印度也支持和平解决朝鲜问题，这从印度总理尼赫鲁的几次努力可以看出来。他说：这使得亚洲人民知道苏联是主张和平、自由、独立的，而美国则是主张侵略战争的。美国士兵，包括受到种族歧视的黑人在内，并不是为自由而战，而是为美国垄断资本奴役亚洲人民。美国是根据联合国决议而行动的说法，也为下列事实所驳倒：即美国是把联合国置于既成事实之前。全世界人民，包括美国人民在内，要求立即停止美国在亚洲的侵略。全世界善意的人民都支持斯大林答复尼赫鲁和平解决朝鲜问题的声明。这个声明反映了苏联的和平政策，这种政策也可以在苏联提交安理会的决议草案中看出来。马立克最后说：美国的决议草案应予以断然拒绝，因为这个决议草案力图扩大侵略。马立克的演说被翻译后，安理会即行休会，九月六日再开。
