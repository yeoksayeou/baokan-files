Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The National Women Workers' Work Conference convened by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has determined the tasks and methods for future trade union women workers' work. Based on the experience of women workers' work over the past year, the conference believes that to do a good job in trade union women workers' work, trade union organizations at all levels must establish women workers' departments (and women workers' committees should be established in grassroots trade union organizations). The central task of the women workers' department at present is to organize women workers to participate in production emulation drives and give greater play to the active role of women workers in production.

The conference affirmed that the women workers' work over the past year has been successful. The conference pointed out that the importance of women workers' work is not only because there is a considerable number of women workers in the entire working class, but more importantly because women workers have long been subjected to feudal oppression, and therefore their political and cultural levels lag behind those of male workers in many ways. At the same time, women workers also have other special difficulties. Therefore, to do a good job in the entire trade union work, special attention must be paid to the work of women workers.

Li Lisan, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, emphasized at the meeting that trade union organizations must attach importance to and strengthen the leadership of women workers' work. He said: Trade unions should be concerned about the demands of women workers, take care of the characteristics of women workers, and solve the special difficulties of women workers in all kinds of work. Trade union organizations, especially leading cadres, must clearly recognize this issue ideologically. The basic task of the women workers' department is to supervise and inspect the trade union organizations to pay attention to and strengthen the work of women workers.

Cai Chang, Minister of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said in the conference summary: The Women Workers' Department should conduct in-depth investigations and research on the demands of women workers and all issues related to women workers, and do a good job in maternal and child health, childcare, and family-related work that meets the special needs of women workers. The Women Workers' Department should also strive to improve the cultural and technical level of women workers.

During the meeting, Li Dequan, Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, attended the meeting and made a report on the National Health Work Conference. The meeting also invited Zhu Lian, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Maternal and Child Health of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, and Kang Keqing, Minister of Welfare of the All-China Women's Federation, to hold a forum on the work of factory nurseries.

This meeting was presided over by Cai Chang, Minister of the Women Workers' Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and was held in Beijing from August 16th to 27th.

　　女工工作会议确定今后任务
    组织女工参加生产竞赛 
    各级工会组织必须设立女工部
    【新华社二日讯】中华全国总工会召开的全国女工工作会议确定了今后工会女工工作的任务与方法。会议根据一年来女工工作的经验，认为要作好工会女工工作，各级工会组织必须设立女工部（在工会基层组织中设女工委员会）。目前女工部的中心任务是组织女工参加生产竞赛，更高地发挥女工在生产中的积极作用。
    会议肯定了一年来的女工工作是有成绩的。会议指出女工工作的重要不只是因为在整个的工人阶级中有相当数量的女工，更主要地是因为女工过去长期受着封建压迫，因而她们在政治水平、文化水平等多方面赶不上男工，同时女工还有其他特殊的困难，因此要作好整个工会工作，必须对女工工作予以特别的注意。
    中华全国总工会副主席李立三，在会议上着重说明工会组织必须重视和加强对女工工作的领导。他说：工会在各种工作中都要关心女工的要求，照顾女工的特点，解决女工的特殊困难。工会组织尤其是领导干部，都必须在思想上明确认识这一问题。女工部的基本任务就是督促、检查工会组织重视和加强女工工作。
    中华全国总工会女工部部长蔡畅在会议总结中说：女工部应深入调查研究女工群众的要求和一切有关女工的问题，作好妇婴卫生、保育、家属等有关女工特殊要求的工作。女工部并应努力于提高女工的文化水平和技术水平。
    会议期间，中央人民政府卫生部部长李德全曾到会作了有关全国卫生工作会议的报告。会议并曾邀请中央人民政府卫生部妇幼局副局长朱琏、中华全国妇女联合会福利部长康克清，举行了工厂托儿所工作的座谈会。
    这个会议由中华全国总工会女工部部长蔡畅主持，于八月十六日至二十七日在北京举行。
