Mao Zedong Locomotive (Serialized Novella)

    Twenty-Five, "That's good, that's good!"
    The group criticism meeting was held.
    At the beginning, the old hero, following Guo Shude's repeated advice, made a self-criticism at the meeting, saying that he was too impatient, unable to unite everyone well, and too narrow-minded.
    Zheng Dugong didn't expect the old hero to say this and couldn't help but say:
    "Old hero, if you really say that, then I also have shortcomings!..."
    Everyone also offered suggestions to them both, the central idea being: to truly realize "unity, friendship, and mutual assistance," their relationship must first be improved.
    Then, Guo Shude repeated the words he had discussed with Zheng Dugong the day before at the meeting, hoping that the entire group would respect the old hero and obey his leadership, including himself.
    Everyone didn't say anything and expressed their agreement. Old Shang's expression didn't seem like agreement or opposition. He stared at the old hero, then at Guo Shude, and didn't say a word.
    Old Zheng spoke:
    "Can I make another suggestion? He's the driver chief and a hero. We don't need to keep making him angry. I want to switch shifts."
    When the old hero heard this, he thought, "That's great, I didn't want to be on the same shift as you anymore!" So he said:
    "I also agree with Old Zheng's suggestion."
    Everyone didn't express opposition. Guo Shude took this opportunity to bring up the planned arrangement, saying that switching shifts would be good, making it easier for everyone to get to know and understand each other better. He suggested assigning Wang Qingquan and Yang Daofang from his shift to the old hero and Shang Baoheng, because the two of them were learning to be firemen and needed to learn from experienced drivers. As a new driver himself, he needed two experienced firemen to help him and was willing to assign Zheng Dugong and Sun Changxin to his shift.
    When everyone heard this, some said "That's good, that's good" repeatedly, while others said "Agreed."
    Seeing that Old Shang and Old Zheng hadn't expressed their opinions, Guo Shude continued:
    "Since everyone has no objections, I have another point. Apart from the old hero, Shang Da Che has been here the longest and has the best skills. We should all learn from him, respect him, and listen to his guidance."
    Wang Qingquan and Yang Daofang both said:
    "We must work hard to learn from Shang Da Che and hope that Shang Da Che will give us more guidance."
    Everyone also chimed in, saying that if everyone on the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" learned the skills from the old hero and Shang Da Che and learned the politics from Guo Da Che, striving to be a model locomotive for the entire section, there would be no problem with safety.
    Shang Baoheng felt his face flush for the first time, unsure whether it was from happiness or embarrassment. Seeing everyone looking at him, he said:
    "Guo Da Che is too polite. My skills are still far behind. I need Guo Da Che to guide me even more in politics. However, I will definitely teach what I know, as long as everyone is willing to learn. I will never be conservative..."
    People couldn't help but applaud. Only then did Old Shang wipe the sweat from his forehead and sit down. When Old Zheng saw this scene, he suddenly felt very flustered, not knowing why. Although he applauded along with the others, he stopped after a while, staring at Old Shang for a while, then at Old Guo, then at Old Guo again at Old Shang, sniffing and his heart pounding.

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）

    二十五、“这样好这样好！”
    小组检讨会召开了。
    一开始，老英雄就依照郭树德三番两次的劝告，在会上作了检讨，说自己性情太急躁，不能很好的团结大家，肚量也太小。
    郑笃恭没提防老英雄会这末说话，不由的说：
    “老英雄你真要这么说，那我也有不对的地方！……”
    大家又都给他们两个提了意见，中心意思是：要真正实现“团结友爱互相帮助”，他两个的关系先要搞好。
    接着郭树德把前天和郑笃恭谈的那些话又在会上谈了一遍，希望全组都要尊敬老英雄，服从他的领导，连他自己在内。
    大家没有说什么，都表示同意。老商的神气不像同意也不像反对，瞪着两眼看看老英雄又看看郭树德，也一直没有说话。
    老郑说话了：
    “我再提个意见行不行？人家是司机长，又是英雄，咱犯不着老叫他生气，我想调调班。”
    老英雄一听，心想：“正好，我早不想和你一班了！”于是说道：
    “老郑这意见我也同意。”
    大家也没有表示反对，郭树德就趁这机会把预定的计划提出来，说调换调换也好，这样便于大家互相多认识，多了解。他提议：把自己一班的王清权和杨道芳分给老英雄和商宝恒，因为他二人是学习司炉，需要跟着老司机学习。他自己是新司机，需要两个老司炉帮助，愿意把郑笃恭和孙长信编在自己一班。
    大家一听，有的连声说“这样好这样好”，有的说“同意”。
    郭树德见老商、老郑没有表示意见，又说道：
    “既然大家没有不同意的，我还有一点意见，就是咱们这车上，除了老英雄，就数商大车日子长，技术好，咱们都要好好向他学习，尊重他，听他的教导。”
    王清权、杨道芳都说：
    “我们一定要跟商大车努力学习，希望商大车多多指教我们。”
    大家也你一句我一句的，说“毛泽东号”要是都跟老英雄、商大车学好了技术，跟郭大车学好了政治，争取做全段机车的榜样，保险没有问题。
    商宝恒头一次感觉脸上发热，自己也闹不清是高兴还是难为情。他见大家都看着他，他说了：
    “郭大车太客气了。我商宝恒这两下子还差得远，政治方面更要郭大车指点我。不过，我懂得的，只要大家愿学，我一定教，决不保守。……”
    人们禁不住都鼓起掌来，老商这才擦着额头的汗坐下去。老郑一看这情景，心里突然很发慌，自己也不知道为什么。虽然别人鼓掌他也鼓掌，可是鼓着鼓着就停住了，盯着看一阵老商又看一阵老郭，看一阵老郭又看一阵老商，吸溜着鼻子，心冬冬乱跳。（附图片）
