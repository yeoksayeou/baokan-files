　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 30th — People from provinces in the Central and Southern China region are furiously protesting the crimes of U.S. aircraft intruding into our airspace and killing our compatriots.

　　The Hubei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Hubei Provincial Farmers' Association have issued written statements protesting the shameless acts of aggression by U.S. imperialism. Feng Chengfa, a first-class production model of the Hubei Military Region Command who has been credited with three major and four minor merits in combat, said indignantly: "The Chinese people are not to be trifled with. Our People's Liberation Army is fully confident of defeating U.S. imperialism. China's territory, territorial waters, and airspace will never be allowed to be violated by anyone." Jiang Xia, deputy secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, said: Hubei youth will join the people of the whole country to resolutely oppose the aggression of U.S. imperialism and defend the independence and integrity of our sacred motherland and world peace. The person in charge of the Hubei Provincial Branch of the China Democratic League also issued a statement, severely condemning the aggressive crimes of U.S. imperialism and firmly demanding that the perpetrators be punished and compensation be paid for the losses.

　　Cheng Qian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Military and Political Committee, issued a statement stating: The Chinese people, who have been tempered by a long period of revolution, are not afraid of any provocation and will surely be able to defeat any aggressor and resolutely liberate Taiwan. The Preparatory Committee of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions and the Farmers' Association, on behalf of the workers and farmers of the province, lodged a serious protest against the aggressive acts of U.S. imperialism. Soldiers of a certain regiment of the Hunan Military Region near Linjiang in Northeast China expressed at a symposium: They must prepare their forces to repel the aggression of U.S. imperialism. The Hunan Branch of the China Peace Committee, representing 30 million peace-loving people in the province, sent a telegram to the President of the Security Council, Malik, and Secretary-General Lie, requesting sanctions against this act of aggression by U.S. imperialism. Changsha's New Hunan Daily and Democratic Daily have both published editorials, firmly supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's protest to the U.S. government and demanding that the Security Council immediately sanction this monstrous crime by the United States.

　　The Consultative Committee of the People's Representatives Conference of Henan Province, more than 20 people's organizations and units in Henan Province and Kaifeng City, after hearing the news of U.S. aircraft attacking our airspace and killing our compatriots, sent telegrams to the United Nations Security Council one after another, supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the U.S. government and accusations and suggestions to the United Nations Security Council. Wang Yizhai, vice chairman of the Consultative Committee of the People's Representatives Conference of the province, called on the people of the province to rise up together, raise their political consciousness, and fight to defeat the aggression of U.S. imperialism. Liu Jixue of the Henan Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang said: The people of our country must never tolerate this brutality of U.S. imperialism. Ma Jiwu, principal of the Provincial Beicang Girls' High School, said in a written statement: We do not need war, nor are we afraid of war. We must always stand firmly with the peace-loving people of the world and work together for lasting world peace.

　　The entire delegation of the first People's Representatives Conference of all walks of life in Jiangxi Province, which is being held in Nanchang, immediately passed and issued a circular telegram after hearing the news of the U.S. imperialist air force attacking our airspace, representing the 15 million people of the province to protest the provocative behavior of U.S. imperialism. People's organizations and local organizations of democratic parties in Jiangxi Province also successively issued circular telegrams on the 29th, unanimously supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's serious protest to the U.S. government. The Jiangxi Provincial Farmers' Association called on the 12 million farmers in the province in a circular telegram to work hard in production, support the People's Liberation Army, and defend every inch of the sacred territory of the motherland.

　　People's organizations in Guangxi stated in a written protest: The people of our entire Guangxi Province express their serious protest against the crimes of U.S. imperialism invading Korea and violating our country's airspace. It stated: Our country believes that the U.S. plane's provocation is another act of aggression following the U.S. imperialist invasion of Taiwan. The Chinese people refuse to tolerate it.
