　　Songjiang Provincial Party Committee Improves Rectification Leadership
    Overcomes Tendency Towards Superficial Inspection of Leadership
    [本报讯] The Songjiang Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has initially improved its leadership over the rectification movement, and has begun to grasp the correct rectification policy of combining central tasks to solve major problems; it has overcome the tendency of aimlessly and superficially allowing everyone to inspect the leadership. According to the reports from the rectification leading cadres meeting of various agencies on August 30th, except for individual agencies, most have grasped the policy of solving major problems. Originally, at the rectification meeting of county party secretaries, county heads, and major provincial cadres convened by the Provincial Party Committee on July 24th, the Provincial Party Committee leadership did not implement the correct rectification policy of the Northeast Bureau of checking the main work and the implementation of basic policies. It had no idea what major problems in the work of the Provincial Party Committee should be solved at the meeting, thus causing the meeting to take a detour. The method of convening the meeting was to generally ask everyone to raise opinions to the leadership. The participants in the meeting were responsible cadres from various counties and major cadres from various provincial departments and offices, who then raised their own departmental demands and opinions to the leadership: from the promotion of new farm implements to the management of veterans, the hospital's houses and floors, etc.; from urban work, rural work to cadres' salaries and living standards, etc. So many problems were raised, involving a very wide range of aspects. How could they all be solved in one meeting? As a result, the meeting could not be wrapped up and no conclusions could be drawn. The Provincial Party Committee's leadership was mostly limited to how to divide into groups and what the steps should be, and did not put its main energy into studying the opinions raised by everyone and what problems the meeting should focus on solving. When everyone raised many opinions that could not be concluded, the leadership asked everyone to "exchange" opinions and展开 mutual criticism, even asking "everyone to solve problems" and "everyone to draw conclusions." However, everyone was looking at the leadership, waiting for them to solve the problems, and mutual criticism could not be carried out. The intentions of the leadership and the emotions of everyone could not be combined. Finally, the Provincial Party Committee summarized four issues at the meeting: guiding principles, policies and ideology, leadership style and methods, economic construction, and cadre policies; and divided the representatives attending the meeting into four groups for discussion. However, the issue of guiding principles and policies still did not specify which guiding principles and policies should be focused on solving; the latter issues also included many specific issues such as the relationship between the province and the city, cadre treatment, and the salary system. At the same time, these four issues did not necessarily solve the main problems of the leadership. The Provincial Party Committee had made a great determination in this rectification to accept everyone's opinions in order to improve its leadership work, but it failed to achieve the desired results due to deviations in the implementation of the central and Northeast Bureau's rectification policies. Naturally, in this half-month meeting, several shortcomings in the Provincial Party Committee's implementation of policies and working methods were exposed, which were beneficial to the Provincial Party Committee's continued in-depth inspection of its work. At present, the Songjiang Provincial Party Committee has greatly improved its leadership over the rectification movement, but this lesson should also attract the attention of rectification leading organs in various places.

　　松江省委改进整风领导
    克服泛泛检查领导偏向
    【本报讯】中共松江省委对整风的领导已初步改进，开始掌握了结合中心工作解决主要问题的正确的整风方针；克服了漫无目的，泛泛地让大家检查领导的偏向。据八月三十日各机关整风领导干部会议所汇报的情况看来，除个别机关外，一般的都已掌握了解决主要问题的方针，原来在七月二十四日省委召开的县委书记、县长及省直主要干部的整风会议上，由于省委领导上没有执行东北局以检查主要工作与基本政策执行情况的正确的整风方针，对于会议上要解决省委工作中的那些主要问题，是心中无数，因而使会议走了弯路。会议的开法是笼统地叫大家对领导提意见。参加会议的是各县的负责干部和省各厅、处的主要干部，便各自向领导上提出自己部门的要求和意见：从新式农具的推广到荣军的管理、医院的房子和地板等问题；从城市工作、农村工作到干部的薪金生活待遇等问题。问题提出得非常多，涉及的方面非常广，在一次会议上如何能一一解决呢？结果使会议无法收拾，做不出结论。省委对会议的领导则多限于如何划组，步骤如何，而没有把主要精力放在研究大家提出的意见及会议应着重解决什么问题上。当大家的意见提得很多而无法做出结论时，领导上要大家“交换”意见，互相展开批评，甚至要“大家解决问题”，“大家做结论”。而大家呢，却眼睛望着领导上等着解决问题，彼此之间无法展开批评。领导上的意图和大家的情绪始终结合不起来。最后省委的会议上归纳出了四个问题：指导方针政策思想、领导作风方法、经济建设和干部政策；并将出席会议的代表划分成四个小组进行讨论。但是在方针政策问题中仍没有指出要着重解决那几个方针政策问题；在后几个问题中也还包括着省、市关系、干部待遇、薪金制等许多具体问题，同时这四个问题并不一定能解决领导上的主要问题。省委在这次整风中是下了很大决心要接受大家的意见以改进领导工作的，但是由于在执行中央及东北局整风方针上出了偏差，而不能收到预期的效果。自然，在这半月的会议中还是暴露了省委在执行政策与工作方法上的若干缺点，对于省委以后继续深入检查工作是有益处的。目前松江省委对整风的领导已有很大改进，但是这个教训却还应引起各地整风领导机关的注意。
