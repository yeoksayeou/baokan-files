　　Shanghai Factories See Workers' Production Enthusiasm Soar After Model Worker Campaign
　　Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory Increases Output, State-Run No. 7 Cotton Mill Sets New Record for Flat Car Production

　　[This newspaper Shanghai News] Following the large-scale model worker campaign, Shanghai factories have seen a widespread surge in workers' production enthusiasm, spurred by the slogan "Achieve Merit Through Production, Earn Respect for All," directly stimulating increased production. For example, when Liu Fupei, a worker at the State-Run Shanghai Silk Weaving Factory, was selected as a national model worker representative, the entire factory was stirred. Zhu Achuan and Jin Quanfa, workers in the factory's silk preparation workshop, resolved to emulate Liu Fupei. They devised a method to better utilize the machines, thereby increasing output. Previously, their workshop's sizing machines averaged about 150 warps sized per day. After careful calculation, they realized that boiling the paste before sizing took up half an hour of work time. By boiling the paste in advance before starting work, they could gain an additional half hour of production time. Furthermore, stopping the machines during lunch breaks wasted three-quarters of an hour. By taking turns eating, the machines could run continuously. As a result of these improvements, daily output increased from 150 warps to 200 warps. After the celebration rally for model workers at the State-Run No. 7 Cotton Mill, the fine spinning maintenance section discussed and implemented a new method of division of labor for flat car maintenance. Previously, leveling one car cost over a hundred work hours and still revealed many problems when the car was started. This time, with increased labor enthusiasm and a vigorous work ethic, coupled with the new method, the resulting No. 33 car met standards while also saving labor, requiring only ninety-two work hours in total. The spun yarn was also satisfactory. When leveling the No. 34 car, everyone worked even harder. To their surprise, leveling the car took only eighty-one and a half work hours, setting a new record for the factory. During this model worker campaign, the fine spinning cleaning team at the State-Run No. 19 Cotton Textile Mill strived to become a model workshop, proposing that each team should clean an additional machine and ensure a reasonable cleaning cycle. When this news reached the leather roller workshop, the workers there said, "Zhao Yushan, our representative of the leather roller workshop, is a model worker, so our work cannot lag behind!" They unanimously guaranteed, "We will add two small iron rollers for cleaning fine yarn leather rings," challenging the coarse spinning cleaning team. The workers at the downtown supply station of the Wusong Gas Plant were highly proactive in production after the model worker campaign. Recently, they were repairing pipelines in a new village, a task estimated to take three days. However, despite the sudden heavy rain, the workers were determined to learn from the model workers. The rain soaked their clothes, but could not dampen their fiery hearts. The work estimated to take three days was completed in just one day. In the installation of indoor supply pipelines, Guo Nianji's team and others adopted a division of labor and cooperation method, completing a project estimated to take nine days in just five and a half days.

　　上海市各工厂经过评模运动
    工人生产情绪高涨
    上海绢纺织厂产量提高，国营第七棉纺厂创平车新纪录
    【本报上海讯】据解放日报消息：上海市各工厂通过这次大规模的评模运动后，工友们在“生产立功，人人尊敬”的鼓舞下，生产情绪普遍高涨，直接刺激了生产上升。如国营上海绢纺织厂工友柳富培当选了全国劳模代表后，全厂轰动。该厂绢丝准备工场工友朱阿川及金全法，立志向柳富培看齐，两人想出办法，更好地利用机器，使产量提高。过去他们场的浆纱车每天平均上浆一百五十匹左右，他俩仔细核计，上纱前烧浆就要占去工作时间半小时，如提早在开工前烧浆，就可增加半小时的生产；吃中饭时一向停车，要浪费三刻钟时间，如两人轮班吃饭，车子就可以不停。这样改进的结果，日产量由一百五十匹增到二百匹。国营第七棉纺厂经过劳模庆功大会后，精纺保全部讨论出分工负责的新办法来进行平车工作。过去平一部车费了一百多个工，并且开车时还发现不少毛病；这一次大家劳动热情高涨，工作起劲，又实行了新办法，结果平出的三十三号车，既合标准又省工，共只花了九十二个工，纺出的纱又令人满意。平三十四号车时，大家更加努力，平车完毕，出乎意外地只花了八十一工半，创造了该厂的新纪录。国营第十九棉纺织厂在这次评模运动中，精纺揩车组全体工友争取做模范车间，提出每组应增加揩一台车，并保证揩车周期的合理。消息传到皮辊间，皮辊间工友说：“皮辊间出了劳模代表赵玉山，我们的工作可不能落后啊！”也一致保证：“我们增加揩细纱皮圈小铁辊二台”，向粗纺揩车组应战。吴淞煤气厂市中心供应处的工友们在评模后，生产非常积极，最近修复某新村的管线工作，预计三天完成，但突逢大雨，工友们一致要向劳模学习，大雨淋湿衣服却湿不了火热的心，预计三天的工作只一天便完成了。在装置屋内供应管线工作上，郭年记等一组采用分工合作，使预计九天的工程，在五天半内就完了工。
