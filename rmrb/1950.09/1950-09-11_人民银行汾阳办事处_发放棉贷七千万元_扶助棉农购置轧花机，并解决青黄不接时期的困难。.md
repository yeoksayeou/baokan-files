    People's Bank of Fenyang Office
    Issues 70 Million Yuan in Cotton Loans
    To Help Cotton Farmers Purchase Cotton Gins and Solve Difficulties During the Lean Season.
    [Our Dispatch] The People's Bank of Fenyang Office has issued 70 million yuan in loans through the supply and marketing cooperative to support the masses in purchasing cotton gins and to solve the production and livelihood difficulties felt by the masses due to the lean season.
    Last year, Fenyang County planted over 40,000 mu of cotton. According to statistics from the industrial and commercial associations in various districts, the masses had 108 cotton gins. After the cotton harvest, due to the abundance of cotton and the shortage of gins, some cotton farmers had to transport the harvested seed cotton to villages in the neighboring counties of Pingyao and Wenshui to be ginned. This year, under the government's call, the area planted with cotton has expanded to 100,000 mu, an increase of one and a half times compared to last year, and cotton gins will be even more insufficient. In order to solve the problem of cotton ginning for the masses, the office and the Fenyang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative agreed that the bank would lend 50 million yuan to the county cooperative to purchase cotton gins. According to the principle of special funds for special purposes, a contract was signed, specifically stipulating the time limit, interest rate, and distribution method. The county cooperative then remitted all the loans to Tianjin and entrusted the North China General Cooperative to purchase 50 cotton gins on its behalf, and the cotton gins will be transported back to Fenyang before the end of August. In addition, after the cotton-producing area expanded, the wheat fields decreased relatively, and some people in the disaster areas felt difficulties in both their lives and production in the two months before the cotton harvest. When the masses borrowed wheat from private individuals, they had to return about 30 jin of lint cotton after the cotton harvest for every shi of wheat borrowed. The masses had to pay about 9 jin more cotton for every shi of wheat they borrowed. In order to take care of the people's difficulties, the local government allowed some truly struggling farmers to postpone the payment of public grain until after the cotton harvest, but because there were many households in difficulty, this kind of borrowing phenomenon still occurred continuously. To this end, the office and the county cooperative agreed to lend 20 million yuan and decided to pre-purchase the masses' cotton fairly according to the grain-to-cotton price ratio after the cotton harvest. This loan contract was also signed on July 25 and pre-purchasing began, stating that each shi of wheat would pre-purchase 25.5 jin of cotton. Because the price was fair, the masses were very satisfied with the cooperative.

　　人民银行汾阳办事处
    发放棉贷七千万元
    扶助棉农购置轧花机，并解决青黄不接时期的困难。
    【本报讯】人民银行汾阳办事处通过供销社放款七千万元扶植群众购置轧花机，并解决群众因青黄不接所感受的生产、生活支垫困难。
    汾阳全县去年种棉四万余亩，据各区工商会统计：群众有轧花机一百零八台，收棉后因棉多机少，部分棉农曾将所收籽花，运到邻县平遥、文水所属村庄去轧。今年在政府号召下，农民种棉扩大到十万亩，较去年增加一倍半，轧花机将更不够运用。该处为解决群众轧花困难，便与汾阳县供销社协议，由银行贷款给县社五千万元购买轧花机。并以专款专用原则，订立合同，具体规定了期限、利率及发放办法。县社随即将全部贷款汇往天津、委托华北总社代为购买轧花机五十台，尽八月底前将轧花机运回汾阳。另外产棉区扩大后，麦地相对减少，部分灾区群众，在收棉前两个月内，生活及生产皆感困难，群众向私人借麦，一石麦收棉后须还皮棉三十斤左右。群众借麦一石即须多出棉花九斤左右。当地区政府，为照顾人民困难，虽对一部分真正困难的农民允将公粮缓期至收棉后缴纳，但因困难户较多，这种借贷现象，仍不断发生。为此，该处与县社又协议，贷款二千万元，决定按收棉后粮棉比价公平预购群众棉花。此项贷款亦于七月二十五日订立合同。并开始进行预购，言明每石麦预购棉花二十五斤半。因价格公道，群众对合作社很满意。
