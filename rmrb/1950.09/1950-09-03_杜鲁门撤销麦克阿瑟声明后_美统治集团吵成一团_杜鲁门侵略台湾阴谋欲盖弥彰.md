　　Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Truman's order on August 27th for MacArthur to retract his statement regarding Taiwan, in an attempt to conceal the US's act of aggression against Taiwan, has proven to be nothing more than a clumsy and futile maneuver. The Baltimore Sun pointed out: "Comparing Truman's 're-statement' with MacArthur's statement, there is no basic conflict." Scripps-Howard newspapers also editorialized that MacArthur "merely elaborated on one of the issues mentioned by the President himself in his statement on June 27th." The New York Times' editorial on August 29th, while stating that "Truman has the right to do so," questioned "whether the method he chose in handling the MacArthur affair was indeed the most appropriate method under the current circumstances." The newspaper complained that "Truman did not properly reconcile the political and military viewpoints," and praised MacArthur's statement as "clearly an effort to draw the President's and the public's attention to the military viewpoint."

　　Therefore, it is not surprising that most American newspapers, whether they approved or pretended to disapprove, still published MacArthur's statement that Truman ordered to be withdrawn. The United States Information Service quoted American newspapers as saying that Truman's action was a "hasty and ineffective attempt" that "actually gave the statement wider publicity than it would have received otherwise."

　　The Republican politicians and newspapers, as the "opposition party" to the ruling Democratic Party, seized this opportunity to fiercely attack Truman for "muzzling public opinion" and committing a "terrible mistake." Senate Republican Leader Wherry and House Republican Leader Martin both declared that they could not "suppress" MacArthur's statement. The Republican Party is preparing to use this incident in its election campaign to expand its attacks on Truman. According to United Press, "Their only concern is to ensure that this incident does not fade away."

　　Thus, Truman's hasty attempt to create a smokescreen, out of fear that "hundreds of millions of people in Asia will be outraged by American imperialist adventures (United Press)," has resulted in a chaotic barrage of attacks within the US ruling circles, and his original intention to conceal the truth has been further exposed. This situation has greatly distressed the US ruling circles. The New York Herald Tribune pointed out in an editorial on August 29th: "The impression created by the confusion among senior government officials will certainly not enhance America's prestige abroad, nor will it contribute to unity at home." Associated Press also revealed on August 29th that US government officials are "eagerly" and "worried that the world may lose faith in the sincerity of the United States' support for the United Nations." At the same time, they are also worried that MacArthur will "lose face" as a result.

　　杜鲁门撤销麦克阿瑟声明后
    美统治集团吵成一团   
    杜鲁门侵略台湾阴谋欲盖弥彰
    【新华社一日讯】美国总统杜鲁门于八月二十七日下令麦克阿瑟撤回其关于台湾的声明，以掩饰美国对台湾的侵略一举，已证明不过是一种欲盖弥彰的拙劣手法。巴尔的摩太阳报指出：“把杜鲁门的‘再声明’与麦克阿瑟的声明比较一下，看不出基本的冲突。”斯克利浦斯霍华德系报纸社论也说：麦克阿瑟“不过对总统在六月二十七日自己的声明中所说的几个问题之一略加引申而已”。纽约时报八月二十九日的社论虽然说“杜鲁门有权如此做”，但却认为“他在处理麦克阿瑟事件时所选择的方法是否确为目前情况下最妥当的方法，殊可怀疑”。该报抱怨“杜鲁门没有将政治方面与军事方面的观点予以适当调和”，并嘉许麦克阿瑟的声明“显然是一种企图促使总统与公众注意军事观点的努力”。
    因此，人们对下面的事实就毫不奇怪，即：大多数美国报纸，不论赞成还是装作反对，都还是照样刊载了为杜鲁门所指令撤销的麦克阿瑟声明。美国新闻处引美国报纸的意见说：杜鲁门的行动是“迅速而无效的企图”，“反而使该项声明获得比不这样做时更广泛的宣传”。
    作为现在执政的民主党的“反对党”的共和党政客与报纸，抓住了这个机会，大肆攻击杜鲁门“钳制舆论”，因而已犯了“弥天大错”。参院共和党领袖惠利和众院共和党领袖马丁等都声言不能“压制”麦克阿瑟声明。共和党正准备在竞选运动中利用这一事件，扩大攻击杜鲁门，据合众社称：“他们唯一关心的事是使这一事件不要淹没下去。”
    这样，杜鲁门由于害怕“亚洲数亿人民对美国帝国主义冒险发生愤慨。（合众社）”而慌忙做出来的障眼法，结果还召来了美国统治集团内部的一团混乱的攻讦，他原来企图掩饰的真实意图却反而进一步暴露出来。这种情形使美国统治集团大感苦恼。纽约先驱论坛报在八月二十九日的社论中指出：“政府高级官员间的混乱所造成的印象，当然在国外不会提高美国的威信，在国内也不会有助于团结。”美联社八月二十九日也透露：美国政府官员“急切地”“担心世人可能对美国支持联合国的诚意丧失信任。”同时他们也在担心，麦克阿瑟会由此“失了面子”。
