　　Korean Workers and Peasants Rally
    Determined to Crush American Aggression
    Park Chung-hee calls for overcoming difficulties and striving for victory
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 29] The American aggressor troops' mad actions of landing at Incheon and advancing towards Seoul have further aroused the Korean working people's hatred for the American imperialists and their determination to support the People's Army in defending the motherland with practical actions. In factories and rural areas of North Korea, mass rallies have been held for days to protest the atrocities of the American armed interventionists. Bai Longhuan, a worker at a certain factory, said at a general meeting of all employees: American bandits have destroyed our factories that we repaired in the five years since liberation, and dropped bombs and incendiary bombs on our dormitories, killing our wives and children. We will never forget this blood debt. The new military adventures of the American aggressors will never weaken our strong fighting will. We will support the People's Army in winning the final victory with practical actions of quickly repairing factories and doubling the production of military supplies. A certain railway protection team calmly held a team meeting despite enemy bombing, and unanimously decided to further improve work efficiency, quickly repair damaged traffic routes, prevent derailments, and ensure the timely transportation of military supplies to the front lines.
    While carrying out the autumn harvest of crops such as millet, yellow rice, and sorghum, farmers in various parts of North Korea also held mass rallies, unanimously stating that they would fully supply the harvested grain to the front lines to ensure the needs of the People's Army.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 29] The Pyongyang City Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front held a report meeting on the current situation on the evening of the 26th. More than 1,300 representatives from all walks of life in Pyongyang participated. The meeting began with a speech by Kim Sung-hak, Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee. He said: The American armed interventionists who illegally invaded our motherland, in order to cover up their decline, mobilized a numerically superior force to land in Incheon and madly invade our capital, Seoul. The brave people of Seoul are resolutely defending the capital together with the People's Army. The current serious situation in the motherland requires our people to make further efforts. The people of Pyongyang will dedicate all their strength to fighting for the defense of the banner of the Republic.
    Park Chung-hee then gave a report on the current situation. In her report, she said: The war in the past three months has proved that the heroic People's Army and the power of the people united for a just cause are infinite. All the Korean people are now fighting heroically with the belief that they will win. The plan of American imperialism to conquer Korea will never be realized. She pointed out that victory can only be achieved after difficulties and tests. Temporary and local difficulties are not fundamentally significant to the overall situation of moving towards victory. After citing the heroic struggle of the great Soviet people during the Great Patriotic War and the military situation at that time, she said: The Korean people, united under the banner of the Republic and under the wise leadership of General Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, are able to overcome any difficulties and tests and achieve victory in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the motherland.
    Other speakers at the meeting unanimously expressed their belief in victory and their determination to dedicate all their strength to supporting the People's Army in fighting the war to the end.

　　朝鲜工人农民集会
    决心粉碎美国侵略
    朴正爱号召克服困难争取胜利
    【新华社平壤二十九日电】美国侵略军登陆仁川并向汉城进犯的疯狂行动、更激起了朝鲜劳动人民对美帝国主义者的愤恨和以实际行动支援人民军保卫祖国的决心。朝鲜北半部的工厂和农村，连日召开抗议美国武装干涉者的暴行的群众大会。某工厂工人白龙焕在全体职工大会上说：美国强盗破坏我们解放后五年间修复起来的工厂，在我们的宿舍上空投掷炸弹和烧夷弹，杀害了我们的妻子儿女。我们永远不会忘记这笔血债。美国侵略者新的军事冒险，绝不能削弱我们的坚强的战斗意志，我们将以迅速修复工厂，加倍生产军需物资的实际行动，来支援人民军争取最后胜利。某铁路护路区队不顾敌机轰炸，镇定地举行队员大会，一致决定进一步提高工作效率，迅速修复被破坏的交通路线，防止脱轨事故，保证及时向前线输送军需物资。
    北半部各地农民在进行谷子、黄米、高粱等作物的秋收工作的同时，也召开群众大会，一致表示将收获的粮食充分供应前线，保证人民军的需要。
    【新华社平壤二十九日电】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线平壤市委会二十六日晚召开当前形势的报告大会，参加者有平壤各界人民代表一千三百余人。会议首由平壤市人民委员会委员长金成学致开会辞。他说：非法侵犯我祖国的美国武装干涉者，为掩盖自己的颓势，动员了数量上占优势的兵力在仁川登陆，疯狂地侵犯我国首都汉城。勇敢的汉城市人民正和人民军一起，坚决地保卫着首都。祖国目前的严重形势，要求我们人民作更进一步的奋斗。平壤市人民将献出一切力量，为保卫人民共和国的旗帜而斗争。
    继由朴正爱作了关于目前形势的报告，她在报告中说：三个月来的战争，证明英勇的人民军和为了正义事业而团结起来的人民力量是无穷的。全朝鲜人民现在正怀着必胜的信心，进行着英勇的斗争。美帝国主义要征服朝鲜的计划，是永远不会实现的。她指出：胜利是要经过困难与考验后才能取得的，一时的局部的难关，对于走向胜利的整个形势来说，并无根本的意义。她在引证了伟大的苏联人民在卫国战争时期的英勇斗争和当时的军事形势后说：团结在共和国旗帜下的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜人民领袖金日成将军的英明领导下，为争取祖国的自由、独立而进行的斗争，是能够克服任何困难与考验而取得胜利的。
    会上其他发言者一致表示了必胜的信念，与献出一切力量支援人民军抗战到底的决心。
