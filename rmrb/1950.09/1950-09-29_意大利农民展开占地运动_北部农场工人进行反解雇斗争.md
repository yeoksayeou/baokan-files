　　Simultaneously with the Italian industrial workers' struggle for wage increases and against layoffs, Italian farm workers and landless peasants have also launched land occupation and anti-layoff movements. According to TASS: In many provinces of Sicily, as the autumn sowing season approaches, land occupation movements have erupted. On September 19th, in several counties of Enna province, several groups of peasants occupied the landlords' fields and began cultivating wasteland. Peasants in Agrigento province followed their example. The land occupation movement in Palermo province was the largest in scale, with tens of thousands of peasant队伍 occupying the landlords' uncultivated land. In many places, the police tried their best to drive them away, but to no avail.
　　In northern Italy, farm workers are engaged in a struggle against layoffs. The strike by the 巴未亚 rice paddy workers in protest against the dismissal of 1,300 farm workers and the attempted wage cuts has continued for several days. Farm workers in Novara province held a 24-hour general strike to oppose layoffs. Farmers employed by the Torlonia duke in the Fucino Valley once again seized the Torlonia duke's land to protest the delay in wage payments. Neighboring farmers have announced a sympathy strike. Rice farm workers in the Po Valley, Piedmont, and Lombardy have stopped harvesting work in response to the landlords' attempts to cut wages.

　　意大利农民展开占地运动
    北部农场工人进行反解雇斗争
    【新华社二十七日讯】与意大利产业工人展开要求增加工资与反对解雇斗争的同时，意大利农场工人与无地农民亦已展开了占地和反对解雇运动。据塔斯社报道：西西里的许多省份，随着秋季播种之即将到来，都爆发了占地运动。九月十九日，在安那省的几个郡中，有好几批农民占领了地主的田地并开始耕种荒地。阿格立真托省的农民随着也效法他们的榜样而行动。巴勒摩省的占地运动规模最大，成千上万的农民队伍，占领了地主未耕种的土地。许多地方，警察尽力驱逐，都毫无效果。
    在意大利北部，农场工人进行反解雇的斗争。巴未亚稻田工人为抗议开除一千三百个农场工人和企图削减工资而举行的罢工，已继续了好几天。诺瓦拉省农场工人，为反对解雇举行了二十四小时的总罢工。福齐诺山谷受雇于托隆尼亚大公的农民，为了反对拖延发放工资，再度夺取了托隆尼亚大公的土地。邻近农民并宣布了进行同情罢工。波河河谷，皮德蒙和伦巴底的稻米农场工人，为了答复地主想削减工资的企图，均停止了收割工作。
