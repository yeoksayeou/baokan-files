Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 25th: Following the Senate's passage of the McCarran-Kilgore fascist bill, the National Committees of the Communist Party of the United States and the Progressive Party, along with other progressive organizations, immediately issued written statements declaring their firm struggle to repeal this fascist law.

The statement, signed by William Z. Foster, Chairman of the National Committee of the Communist Party, and Hall Williamson and Winston, Secretaries of the National Committee, emphasized that the law provides many ways to restrict all political activities aimed at promoting peace, fighting for workers' economic well-being, and fighting for the rights of Black people. The statement then declared: "We urge all American compatriots to rise up and fight. This is the time for us to build and strengthen all democratic organizations of workers and all people. This is the time for us to stand up for the democratic rights we cherish and consolidate these democratic rights with heroic joint action. This is the time for all who hate fascism, regardless of political belief, to take common action. Trade unions must continue to intensify their economic struggles and redouble their efforts to abolish the Taft-Hartley Act. Black people must consolidate their growing unity, strive for a genuine civil rights program, and strengthen ties with trade unions and all allies.

No one should be intimidated by this new attempt to intimidate all those who seek peace and do not want an atomic world war. On the contrary, the struggle for peace must unite new supporters, because this fascist war measure exposes the hypocrisy of the two parties claiming to be leaders of the "free world." This measure conceals the true purpose of Wall Street imperialists.

The United States Congress has violated the fundamental law of our country. The American people must uphold the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Congress has authorized fascist forces to enforce a reign of terror. Let the people revoke this authorization and stop the effort to move towards fascism. The sovereignty of the American people cannot be revoked by any act of Congress. Let the people unite to abolish the police state laws proposed by McCarran and Kilgore and stop the implementation of this law.

Benson, Chairman of the National Committee of the Progressive Party, and Baldwin, Secretary, issued a statement stating that the McCarran Act is "a product of American foreign policy. It once again shows that both old parties have gone bankrupt and are corrupt. President Truman and the entire Democratic leadership must be condemned equally with the Republican Party for betraying sacred constitutional rights. As President and leader of the Democratic Party, he could have fully exercised his power to veto. Truman did not do so. He decided to veto the bill twenty-four hours after it was sent to his desk, rather than taking the full ten days (according to the United States Constitution, the President has ten days to exercise the veto power over bills passed by Congress. Truman's hurried veto was intended to allow Congress to re-pass it by a two-thirds majority before adjournment, thus making it law, while at the same time making himself appear to voters as opposing the infringement of basic human rights.) so that the people could exert their greatest influence on the parliament. The Progressive Party will do everything in its power to fight in the courts and at the ballot box, so that no individual or organization will suffer from or lose their freedom because of the passage of this bill. We will work with all organizations and the American people to remove this stain on our nation's character and morality from our legal code.”

The "Civil Rights Congress" also vowed to fight to repeal this "despicable fascist law."

Former Democratic Congressman O'Connell, leader of the United Movement Against Repressive Bills, declared that all opponents will fight to repeal the McCarran-Kilgore Act.

Two hundred delegates attending the New York Labor Peace Conference have passed a resolution vowing to fight to abolish fascist laws.

　　敦促全美人民奋起撤销麦卡伦法案
    美共及进步党等发表声明　反对通过法西斯化的法律
    【新华社二十六日讯】塔斯社纽约二十五日讯：在参院通过麦卡伦——吉尔哥尔法西斯法案以后，美国共产党和进步党的全国委员会以及其他各进步组织立即发表书面声明，宣布他们坚决为撤销这种法西斯法律而斗争。
    由美共全国委员会主席福斯特与全国委员会书记霍尔·威廉逊和温斯顿签署发表的声明强调指出：该法律提供了许多方法，限制一切为促进和平、争取工人经济福利、争取黑人的权利等而进行的政治活动。声明接着宣称：“我们敦促全体美国同胞奋起斗争。这是我们建立和加强工人和全体人民的一切民主组织的时候了。这是我们站起来争取我们所珍惜的民主权利，并以英勇的联合行动来巩固这些民主权利的时候了。这是一切憎恨法西斯主义的人不分政治信仰，采取共同行动的时候了。工会必须继续加紧其经济斗争，而且要加倍努力以废除塔夫脱——哈特来法案。黑种人民必须巩固其日益增强的团结，力争真正的民权纲领，并且加强与工会及所有盟友间的联系。
    任何人都不应该为这种恫吓一切寻求和平而不欲原子世界大战的人们的新企图所唬住。相反地，争取和平的斗争必须团结新的拥护者，因为这个法西斯的战争措施把两党以“自由国家”领袖自居的说法的虚伪性，暴露无遗。这一措施包藏着华尔街帝国主义者的真正目的。
    美国国会已经违犯了我们祖国的根本大法。美国人民必须维护宪法和人权法案。国会已经特许法西斯主义势力强行恐怖统治。让人民撤销这种特许，并阻住走向法西斯主义的努力。美国人民的主权是国会的任何法案所不能取销的。让人民团结起来，废除麦卡伦和吉尔哥尔所提出的警察国家的法律，停止此一法律的实施。
    进步党全国委员会主席宾逊与书记鲍尔温发表声明称：麦卡伦法案是“美国外交政策的产物。它再度显示：两个旧政党都已破产、腐化了。杜鲁门总统与整个民主党领导机关必须对出卖神圣的宪法权利而和共和党受到同等的谴责。作为总统与民主党领袖，他原可充分运用他的职权，做到否决。杜鲁门不这样做，他决定在法案送到他办公桌以后二十四小时就加以否决，而不愿利用整整十天的时间（按根据美国宪法，总统可有十天时间，对国会通过的法案行使否决权，杜鲁门之匆匆进行否决，目的在于使国会在休会之前，来得及以三分之二的多数，再次加以通过而成为法律，同时又使自己在选民面前显得是反对侵犯基本人权的样子。）让人民能够对议会起他们最大的影响。进步党决将竭尽一切力量在法庭和投票箱前斗争，使得任何个人或任何组织都不至因这个法案的通过而遭受其苦或丧失自由。我们决将与一切组织及美国人民群众共同努力，使得我们民族性与道德上的这一污点从我国法典上消除。”
    “民权保障大会”也誓为废除这一“可恶的法西斯法律”而斗争。
    前民主党议员、反对镇压性法案联合运动的领袖奥康奈尔宣称：全体反对者将为废除麦卡伦——吉尔哥尔法案而斗争。
    出席纽约劳工和平大会的二百名代表已通过决议，誓为废除法西斯法律而斗争。
