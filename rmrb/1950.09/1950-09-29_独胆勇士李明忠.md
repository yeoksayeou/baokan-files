　　The Lone Brave Warrior Li Mingzhong
　　Ma Feng

　　I.
　　In mid-November 1948, when our army began to besiege Beijing, the mission of a certain division was to penetrate the enemy's heart from the south of Wanshou Mountain and bloom in the center of the enemy. To accomplish this mission, it was first necessary to open the first gate – the enemy stronghold at Hongshankou.
　　The Panlong Mountain Company was tasked with this arduous assault mission.
　　The combat steps were specifically assigned: the first platoon was the assault platoon of the entire company, and the second squad was the assault squad of the entire platoon. Each platoon and squad held combat mobilization meetings. Li Mingzhong, a small soldier in the second squad, although newly liberated, made a guarantee to the squad leader: "Squad leader, don't worry! I am now a soldier of Chairman Mao, and I know for whom I am fighting!"
　　Li Mingzhong had been a soldier in the Kuomintang New First Army not long before. He was only liberated in September during the Liaoxi Campaign and had been assigned to the Panlong Mountain Company for less than two months. But in this short period, through the speak bitterness movement and political education, his class consciousness quickly improved, and he became an excellent People's Liberation Army soldier.
　　Li Mingzhong's hometown was Tangjiawan, Dazhou, Sichuan. His father died when he was very young. He herded cattle for others at the age of twelve and worked as a full-time laborer for landlords at the age of sixteen, using animal-like labor to earn leftover tea and rice to support his entire family.
　　Later, the Kuomintang began to draft soldiers. At that time, Li Mingzhong was working as a long-term laborer for a landlord named Bai. The landlord had seven brothers, and one of them was originally drafted, but the landlord and the township chief conspired to send Li Mingzhong as a substitute. From then on, he began another inhuman life.
　　In the Kuomintang army, he suffered beatings and abuse and remained a bullied private for seven or eight years. But all the suffering that the old society gave him has now completely turned into hatred for the enemy. When he recalled his many painful experiences in the past, his courage to kill the enemy increased even more.

　　II.
　　After dark, the battle to attack Hongshankou began.
　　Li Mingzhong carried a submachine gun and followed the assault squad to attack. They bypassed the enemy's fire circle and charged towards the enemy's high ground, quickly capturing the first hill. But there were no enemies on the hill; the enemies had already fled.
　　They quickly charged towards the second hill. Li Mingzhong ran at the front. Just as he reached the hillside, he suddenly saw a group of enemies running down the hill. Looking back at his own people, none of them had come up. At this time, he couldn't wait for the troops, so he carried his submachine gun and closely chased after the enemies. The enemies turned around and shot at him. Li Mingzhong returned two shots, knocking down two enemies. The remaining enemies all lay down, preparing to resist. Li Mingzhong quickly shouted: "Brothers, surrender your guns! You have been completely surrounded by us and cannot escape! The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners well. I was also liberated from the New First Army!" Then he talked about the crimes of the Kuomintang in harming the people and oppressing soldiers, and our army's policy of treating prisoners well. Under his political persuasion, the enemies surrendered their guns. Six prisoners raised their hands, and six guns were placed on the ground. At this time, Li Mingzhong was worried about how to deal with these prisoners. Just as he was in trouble, the second platoon, which was serving as the second echelon, happened to come up. He quickly handed the prisoners over to the second echelon and picked up his submachine gun to continue searching for enemies.
　　He crossed the third hill, traversed a flat road, and climbed onto the fourth hill. He knew that this road was the pass that the main force had to pass through, and he estimated that there must be enemies guarding it. As expected, after walking about fifty meters, he encountered obstacles such as enemy chevaux-de-frise. He quickly climbed down to observe the enemy's movements: suddenly, he found a dark figure coming in front. When the dark figure approached, Li Mingzhong threw a grenade with a flick of his arm. The enemy was so frightened that he lay down. Li Mingzhong shouted loudly: "Surrender and be spared! Raise your hands! I'll beat you to death if you move!" The enemy obediently raised his empty hands and stood up. Li Mingzhong jumped over and confiscated the gun in three steps and two steps. On one hand, he comforted the prisoner; on the other hand, he investigated the enemy's situation. The prisoner told the truth: it turned out that there were bunkers on the hilltop, and there was a heavy machine gun platoon on the hillside, tightly blocking the road that our army had to pass through. He was the liaison soldier of the heavy machine gun platoon, going to the battalion headquarters to get bullets.
　　After learning about this situation, Li Mingzhong was determined to seize the enemy's heavy machine gun position. But how could one person with one gun deal with an enemy platoon? A hard fight would not work. But if this heavy machine gun position was not taken down, the task of opening Hongshankou could not be completed, and the main force would not be able to pass through. After thinking for a long time, he made a final decision: "It is an honor to sacrifice for the revolution. Killing one enemy is enough, and killing two is a bonus." He had the prisoner carry the empty gun on his back and asked him to lead him to the heavy machine gun position. He told him: "If your platoon leader asks you, you say: the battalion commander has ordered that the troops in the rear are all retreating, and retreat when the bullets are used up!" Li Mingzhong held a submachine gun in one hand and a grenade in the other, closely following behind the prisoner. After walking not far, another enemy came over and asked them for the password. The liaison soldier answered the password and whispered to Li Mingzhong that it was their Squad Leader Zhao. Li Mingzhong quickly shouted: "Squad Leader Zhao, the troops in the rear have all retreated, what bullets do you still need?! The battalion commander has ordered to retreat when the bullets are used up!" The captured liaison soldier also said what Li Mingzhong had taught him. Enemy Squad Leader Zhao regarded Li Mingzhong as someone sent by their battalion headquarters. The three of them walked towards the heavy machine gun position together. As Li Mingzhong walked forward, he paid attention to observing the terrain: in front was a small open space, and further on the high ground, there were many dark figures wriggling. The heavy machine gun was spitting out red flames, attacking our army's frontal assault troops. At this time, Li Mingzhong thought: "If the enemies don't surrender and start fighting, I will suffer. It doesn't matter if I sacrifice, but it would be a big deal if the mission is not completed!" Suddenly, he had a flash of inspiration and came up with an idea. He quietly stopped, waited for the liaison soldier and Squad Leader Zhao to walk more than twenty steps away, and just as they were talking to the enemies on the heavy machine gun position, he rushed across the twenty-five-meter open space diagonally, quickly ran to the enemy's heavy machine gun position, and pounced on it, pulling out the ammunition belt from the heavy machine gun. The machine gun immediately went silent. He then picked up his submachine gun and shouted at a large group of enemies in the fortifications: "Surrender quickly! Raise your hands and stand out! If anyone dares to move, I will immediately open fire and shoot!" The enemies were frightened by this sudden attack. They didn't know how many Liberation Army soldiers had rushed up. One by one, they came out with their hands raised. Li Mingzhong shouted again: "Which one is the platoon leader, stand out!" The enemies were so frightened that they didn't dare to say anything. Li Mingzhong said: "It doesn't matter, the platoon leader will also be treated the same. If you don't say, I will open fire and shoot!" Under such coercion, the enemy platoon leader stood out. Li Mingzhong said to him: "Quickly give the order for your rifle squad to surrender their guns!" The enemy platoon leader said: "There is no rifle squad here!" Li Mingzhong shouted: "Nonsense! I was liberated from the Kuomintang army, and I don't know the Kuomintang army's set of using firepower?! Without a rifle squad to cover, would the heavy machine gun dare to be here?!" He pointed the submachine gun at the enemy platoon leader and said: "If you don't give the order, I won't be polite to you!" The enemy platoon leader had no choice but to shout to the side: "Squad Leader Six, come out and surrender your guns! We are all surrounded by the Liberation Army!" As soon as he finished speaking, eight enemies came out of the fortifications not far away, carrying guns. Li Mingzhong saw that the enemies were slowly raising their guns as they walked over. He quickly jumped into the fortifications and used his gun to force the enemy platoon leader to say: "Quickly tell them to surrender their guns obediently! Don't harm everyone because of a few of you! The Liberation Army treats prisoners well after they surrender their guns!"
　　All eight enemies obediently surrendered their guns. Li Mingzhong counted the number of people: including the previously captured liaison soldier and Squad Leader Zhao, there were a total of twenty-four people, sitting down in a large dark mass. He explained our army's policy towards prisoners to the prisoners, and he took out the bullets from the enemies' guns. And he educated them with his own experience. After listening, some of the prisoners said: "We are all the same, all soldiers who were captured by the Kuomintang!" Some said: "We heard about the Liberation Army's good treatment of prisoners when we were in the South!"
　　At this time, Li Mingzhong felt both happy and anxious. He was happy that he had smoothly solved the enemy's heavy machine gun platoon; he was anxious that the bunkers on the top of the mountain had not yet been taken down, and he had to guard this group of prisoners. He thought about sending the prisoners to the second echelon! He then told the prisoners to carry the empty guns on their backs, carry the heavy machine gun, and he himself, holding a submachine gun, escorted them back along the way they came.
　　Climbing over the third hill, the company commander happened to be there with the second echelon. Li Mingzhong reported the situation of the captured enemies to the company commander. The company commander said: "Old Li, your assault team has already rushed to the front, you can rest here for a while!" When Li Mingzhong heard that the assault team had already gone to the front, he couldn't care about anything else and only said: "Company commander, I'm going to chase after our assault team!" He picked up his gun and rushed back to the fourth hill. He ran forward desperately. The road, the chevaux-de-frise obstacles, and the heavy machine gun position he had just occupied all flashed behind him. When he was about to climb to the top of the mountain, someone shouted in front: "Who? Password?" Li Mingzhong recognized that it was the voice of his own people and quickly answered the password. When he went over to take a look, it was indeed the assault team. It turned out that the assault team had attacked and occupied the enemy's high ground from another road and captured twelve prisoners. Everyone was anxious when they saw Li Mingzhong coming back and asked: "Where did you run off to?" At this time, the company commander came up with the second echelon. The company commander said loudly: "You must celebrate Old Li's success! He captured thirty enemies alone and also seized a heavy machine gun!" Everyone shouted enthusiastically when they heard this, and many soldiers surrounded him to congratulate him and asked him about the detailed process of capturing the enemies.
　　At this time, the company commander had already fired the signal to complete the mission. The main force began to pass through Hongshankou along the road, rushing towards Fengtai like a torrent. When Li Mingzhong saw that the mission had been completed, he couldn't help but smile in his heart.

　　III.
　　With his bravery and wisdom, Li Mingzhong opened the enemy's gate with a single gun and captured an enemy platoon. He enabled the troops to pass through Hongshankou smoothly and quickly complete the task of liberating Fengtai.
　　At the whole division's celebration meeting, he was named "Lone Brave Warrior" and awarded a first-class merit. And he was awarded a banner of "Liberated Soldier Model".
　　Later, he followed the troops across the Yangtze River and fought all the way to Sichuan. In every battle, he showed unparalleled bravery and resourcefulness, making no small contribution to the people. (Attached picture)

　　独胆勇士李明忠
    马烽
    一
    一九四八年十一月中旬，我军开始围攻北京的时候，某师的任务是从万寿山南插入敌人心脏，从敌人的中心开花。要完成这一任务，首先必需打开第一道大门——红山口敌据点。
    蟠龙山连担负了这一艰巨的突击任务。
    战斗步骤具体分配了：一排是全连的突击排，二班是全排的突击班。各排各班都开了战斗动员会，二班一位小个子战士李明忠，虽是新解放过来的，但他又向班长提出保证：“班长你放心吧！我如今是毛主席的战士，我知道我为谁打仗！”
    李明忠，不久以前还在国民党新一军当兵，九月间在辽西战场上才解放过来，编到蟠龙山连还不到两个月。但在这短短的时间里，经过诉苦运动和政治教育，阶级觉悟很快提高了，成为了优秀的人民解放军战士。
    李明忠的老家在四川达县唐家湾，很小就死了父亲，他十二岁就给人家放牛，十六岁就顶一个大人给地主扛长活，用牛马般的劳动，换来点剩茶剩饭，养活全家老幼。
    后来国民党开始抽兵，那时李明忠正给一家姓白的地主当长工，地主家弟兄七个，本来被抽中出兵了，但地主和保长一鬼捣，就把李明忠送去作了替身。从此，他又开始了另一种非人的生活。
    在国民党军队里，受尽了打骂折磨，一直混了七八年，仍然是一名受欺凌的小兵。但旧社会所给他的这许多痛苦，如今完全变成了敌忾，当他回忆起以往那许多痛苦经历的时候，更增加了他的杀敌勇气。
    二
    天黑以后，攻击红山口的战斗开始了。
    李明忠提着一支冲锋枪，跟着突击班向前进攻。他们绕过敌人的火力圈，向敌人的制高点冲锋，很快冲上了第一个山包。但山上没有敌人，敌人已经逃跑了。
    他们连忙又往第二个山包上冲，李明忠跑在最前面，刚上到半山腰里，忽见前面一伙敌人往山下逃跑，回头一看自己的人，一个也没有上来。这时他也顾不得等队伍了，端着冲锋枪紧紧追在敌人后边，敌人回过身来向他射击。李明忠还了两枪，打倒了两个敌人，其余的敌人都爬下了，准备进行抵抗。李明忠连忙喊道：“弟兄们缴枪吧！你们已经被我们全部包围了，跑不出去了！人民解放军优待俘虏，我也是刚从新一军解放过来的！”接着又讲了好些国民党残害人民、压迫士兵的罪恶，和我军优待俘虏的政策。在他的政治喊话下，敌人缴枪了。六个俘虏举着手，六支枪摆在地上。这时李明忠发了愁，这些俘虏该如何处理呢？正在为难的时候，可巧担任二梯队的二排上来了，他忙把俘虏交给了二梯队，端起冲锋枪继续向前搜索敌人。
    他越过第三个山包，横穿过一条平坦的汽路，又爬上了第四个山包。他知道这条汽路就是大队人马要通过的关口，估计这里一定会有敌人把守。果不然走了有五十来米，就碰到了敌人的鹿砦等障碍物。他忙爬下来察看敌人的动静：忽然发现前面走来一个黑影，李明忠等黑影走近的时候，一甩臂扔过去一个手榴弹，敌人吓得卧倒了。李明忠大声喊道：“缴枪不杀！举起手来！乱动揍死你！”敌人很驯顺地举着空手站起来了。李明忠三步两步跳过去缴了枪。一面对俘虏进行安慰；一面盘查敌人的情形。俘虏把实话都讲了：原来敌人在山头上有碉堡，半山腰里有一个重机枪排，紧紧封锁着我大军要通过的汽路，他是重机枪排的联络兵，到营部去取子弹的。
    李明忠了解了这些情况后，一心要夺取敌人的重机枪阵地。但一个人一枝枪，怎样去对付敌人一个排呢？硬拚是不行的。可是不把这个重机枪阵地拿下来，打开红山口的任务就完成不了，大队人马就无法通过。想了半天，下了最后决心：“为革命牺牲了也是光荣的，打死一个敌人够本，打死两个赚一个。”他把空枪让俘虏背上，让他引自己到重机枪阵地去。并告他说：“你们排长问你，你就说：营长有命令，后面队伍都撤退了，子弹打完就撤退吧！”李明忠一手端着冲锋枪；一手提着手榴弹紧紧跟在俘虏的后边。走了不多远，前边又过来一个敌人，向他们喝问口令，联络兵答了口令，低声告李明忠说，是他们赵班长。李明忠忙喊道：“赵班长，后边队伍都撤了，你们还要啥子子弹？！营长有命令，子弹打完就撤！”被俘虏的联络兵，也照李明忠教给的话讲了一遍。敌人赵班长把李明忠当成是他们营部派来的人了。三个人相随着往重机枪阵地跟前走。李明忠一面向前走，一面注意观察地形：前面是一小片开阔地，再过去一点的高地上，有许多黑影在蠕动，重机枪吐着红红的火舌，正在向我军正面攻击的部队射击。这时李明忠想道：“万一敌人不缴枪，动起手来自己要吃亏，自己牺牲了没关系，任务完不成事就大了！”忽然灵机一动，想出个主意。他悄悄地停下来，等联络兵和赵班长走出有二十多步，正和重机枪阵地上的敌人答话的时候，他从斜刺里冲过二十五米的开阔地，迅速飞奔到敌人的重机枪阵地上，猛扑过去把重机枪上的子弹带抽了，机枪马上哑了。他随即端起冲锋枪，对着工事里一大堆敌人吼道：“快缴枪吧！举起手站出来！谁敢乱动一下，我马上开枪扫射！”敌人被这个突然的袭击吓傻了，他们也不知冲上来多少解放军。一个个都举着手出来了。李明忠又喊道：“那个是排长，站出来！”敌人吓得都不敢啃声，李明忠道：“没有关系，排长也是一样优待。你们不说我就开枪扫射了！”在这样的威逼下，敌排长站出来了，李明忠对他说：“快下命令，叫你们步枪班缴枪！”敌排长说：“这里没有步枪班！”李明忠喝道：“胡说！我是从国民党军队解放过来的，还不知道国民党军队使用火力这一套？！没有步枪班掩护，重机枪敢在这里？！”把冲锋枪对准敌排长，又道：“你不下命令，对你可不客气了！”敌排长无奈，只好向旁边喊道：“六班长，出来缴枪吧！咱们都叫解放军包围了！”话音刚落，从不远处的工事里，提着枪走出八个敌人来。李明忠看到敌人一面往过走，一面慢慢在端枪。他忙跳到工事里，用枪逼着敌排长道：“快叫他们安安份份缴枪！有一个反抗的，我就先揍死你！”敌排长急得忙喊道：“六班长，好好缴枪吧！不要为你们几个害了我们大家！缴了枪解放军优待俘虏！”
    八个敌人都乖乖地缴枪了。李明忠数了一下人数：连先前俘虏的联络兵和赵班长，总共二十四个人，黑鸦鸦坐下一大片。他一面给俘虏们讲解我军的俘虏政策，一面把敌人枪里的子枪都退了出来。并且以自己的亲身经历教育他们。俘虏们听了，有的说：“咱们都一样，都是被国民党抓来的兵！”有的说：“在南方时候就听说解放军优待俘虏！”
    这时，李明忠心里又高兴，又着急。高兴的是顺利解决了敌人重机枪排；着急的是山顶上的碉堡还没拿下来，而自己又非守着这群俘虏不可。他想把俘虏还是送交二梯队吧！当时便叫俘虏把空枪背上，把重机枪抬上，他自己端着冲锋式在后面押着，顺着来时的路子往回返。
    翻上第三个山包，正好连长带的二梯队在那里。李明忠把俘虏敌人的情形，向连长报告了一遍，连长说：“老李，你们突击队已经冲到前边去了，你在这里休息一下吧！”李明忠一听突击队已经到前面去了，什么也顾不得了，只说了句：“连长，我追我们突击队去！”端起枪又冲回了第四个山包，他拚命向前奔跑，汽车路、鹿砦障碍、刚才占领过的重机枪阵地，都闪在后边了。快爬到山顶上的时候，前边有人喊道：“谁？口令？”李明忠听出了是自己人的声音，忙答了口令。过去一看，果然是突击队。原来突击队从另外一条路，攻占了敌人这个制高点，并抓了十二个俘虏。大家见李明忠回来了，都急得问道：“你跑到那里去了？”正在这时，连长带着二梯队上来了。连长大声说：“你们要给老李庆功！他一个人俘虏了三十个敌人，还缴了一挺重机枪！”大家听了，都热烈的叫喊起来，好多战士都围上来庆贺他。问他俘虏敌人的详细经过。
    这时连长已发射了完成任务的信号，大队人马顺汽路从红山口开始通过，像激流般地冲向丰台去了。李明忠看到任务已经完成，心里不由地笑了。
    三
    李明忠，以他的勇敢和智慧，单人独枪打开了敌人的大门，俘虏了敌人一个排。使部队顺利通过红山口，迅速完成了解放丰台的任务。
    在全师的庆功大会上，被评为“独胆勇士”，记了一大战功。并且获得了“解放战士榜样”的锦旗一面。
    以后，随部队杀过了长江，直打到四川、在每次战斗中，都表现了无比的勇敢和机警，为人民立了不小功劳。（附图片）
