How to Determine Agricultural Tax Amounts in Newly Liberated Areas
    Li Chengrui
    Article 17 of the Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax in Newly Liberated Areas stipulates: "The number of mu of land, yield, and population of the taxpayer households shall be investigated and assessed by the agricultural tax investigation and assessment committee organized by the township (village) people's government, including representatives of all classes, and the amount of tax payable by each household shall be calculated according to the provisions of these regulations, and an agricultural tax register shall be prepared and submitted to the county (city) people's government for verification," and Article 20 stipulates: "After the harvest of crops, the township (village) people's government shall announce the tax amount on a public list according to the tax amount verified by the county (city) people's government. ..." The "verification of tax amount" mentioned in these two articles refers to the unification of tax rates and tasks. This is an important issue in the implementation of the agricultural tax regulations, and it is necessary to raise it for discussion with comrades in various regions.
  (I) Why "Verify Tax Amount"?
    The purpose of "verifying tax amount" is to strictly implement "taxation according to the rate," ensure national fiscal revenue, and balance the burden on rural areas. It is proposed in response to two deviations in the implementation of agricultural tax last year:
    The first deviation: is to blindly allocate tax revenue tasks from top to bottom at the same tax rate based on the total population, number of mu of land, and yield. For example, Village A has 250 people, 500 mu of land, and a yield of 100,000 jin, while Village B has 250 people, 1,000 mu of land, and a yield of 200,000 jin. Both are allocated tasks of 13,000 jin for Village A and 26,000 jin for Village B, based on a tax rate of 13%. However, according to the regulations, it must be "progressively levied on the average agricultural income per capita based on households" (Article 2 and Article 12 of the New Area Agricultural Tax Regulations), and self-cultivated land, leased land, and tenanted land must be converted separately due to the different nature of income (Article 15). After calculating the tax according to the rate, the average tax rate of Village A (average income of 400 jin per person, relatively poor) will inevitably be less than 13%, while Village B (average income of 800 jin per person, relatively rich) will inevitably be more than 13%. It can be seen that the "task" simply allocated at the same tax rate does not match the result of "taxation according to the rate," and the task contradicts the policy (tax rate). This contradiction is not so significant when the province allocates to the county, but it is very significant when the county allocates to the village. Here are a few examples from the materials at hand:
    (1) Two villages with roughly the same degree of land concentration but different levels of wealth. According to the Shandong method, the result of taxation according to the rate is that the average tax rate of the richer village is about 6% higher than that of the poorer village. For example, Dalinggezhuang in Qihe County, Shandong—average income per person is 321 jin—average tax rate for the whole village is 12.18%. Qiuzhuang in Qihe County, Shandong—average income per person is 548 jin—average tax rate for the whole village is 19.09%.
    (2) Two villages with roughly the same level of wealth but different degrees of land concentration and different amounts of rented land. The result of taxation according to the rate is that the average tax rate for the whole village differs by about 10%. For example, Jindian Village in Jinhua County, Zhejiang—average income per person is 712.5 jin—average tax rate for the whole village is 12.05%. Wubao in Changsheng Township, Ba County, Sichuan—average income per person is 706.83 jin—average tax rate for the whole village is 22.71%.
    If the "task" is simply allocated according to the average tax rate of the total land yield, the poor villages, villages with scattered land, and villages with more tenanted land will not be able to complete the task if the tax is calculated according to the rate, which will lead to phenomena such as extra levies, squeezing large households, and suppressing small households, which violate the policy; while the rich villages, villages with concentrated land, and villages with more leased land will exceed the task if the tax is calculated according to the rate, which may be taken advantage of by embezzlers, or generally reduced, which also violates the policy.
    The second deviation is to simply implement "taxation according to the rate" based on the reported yield in various places, regardless of whether it is true or false, on the basis of an incomplete yield survey. As a result, the result is inevitably "the honest suffer, and the dishonest take advantage." For example, the tax rates for A and B are both 14% according to the reported yield, the authenticity of A is 100%, and the authenticity of B is 70%. As a result, the actual tax rate of B is only 9.8%, which is objectively equivalent to rewarding false reporting and underreporting. Some masses reflect that we "whip the fast ox" (the honest people bear a heavy burden), which is very pertinent. Because this method, under the guise of "fairness and reasonableness" and "taxation according to the rate," conceals the substance of being excessively light or heavy, violating the tax rate, and sometimes even risks making the national income fall through.
    There were many difficult conditions in the grain requisition work last year, and it was inevitable that it was rough, but this year it must be overcome as much as possible. The former deviation was the main one in the grain requisition last year, and the latter was a minority. Although the two deviations are different in form, the result is the same—making the tax rate contradict the task, and the regulations cannot be implemented. This year, after focusing on correcting "commandism" and the "purely task-oriented viewpoint," the latter deviation still has the possibility of developing, so it is necessary to pay special attention to it.
    In order to overcome the deviations of last year, in order to implement "taxation according to the rate," to ensure national fiscal revenue and balance the burden on rural areas, in addition to vigorously investigating land yield, the provision of "verifying the tax rate" must also be strived to be realized.
  (II) How to "Verify Tax Amount"?
    There is no mature experience in the method of "verifying tax amount." Here are just some personal views for reference:
    (1) Steps—First of all, we should use our main strength to "seriously investigate the number of mu of land, yield, and population of taxpayer households, as well as the situation of renting and tenanting, and at the same time rely on the peasant masses to expose the concealment of land, false reporting of yield, and evasion of burdens, and then calculate and assess the amount of tax payable by each household according to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Agricultural Tax," and prepare a register and report it according to the provisions of Article 17 of the regulations, which shall be reviewed item by item by the county and district governments (see the review items later) and put forward opinions. If possible, it is best to submit it to the people's congress of all circles for discussion and decision. If the county people's government cannot calculate and verify the tax amount for each household according to the rate, it can gather the village cadres in the district people's government to recalculate, or return it to each village for the village to verify and levy according to the verified yield income and review opinions, and then report it to the county for approval.
    (2) Verification items: (1) There are five basic items:
    1. Agricultural population, number of mu of land, and average number of mu of land per person.
    2. Average annual yield per mu: should be repeatedly compared for paddy fields, dry land, and sloping land.
    3. Average yield per person: The average yield per person is a concentrated expression of the average land per person and the average yield per mu.
    4. Total annual income of the village and total converted income of the village. The so-called annual income refers to the total amount of income that each household in the village should receive according to the annual yield of the land; the so-called converted income refers to the income after conversion according to the method of adding 20% or subtracting 20% in Article 15 of the regulations, the amount of which depends on the amount of leased land and tenanted land.
    5. Total tax amount of the village and its percentage of the total converted income of the village: After calculating the total tax amount of the village according to the rate for each household, divide it by the converted income to get the average tax rate of the village. Generally speaking, the average tax rate of a village with concentrated land should be higher than the tax rate listed on the tax rate table for the average converted income per person in that village; the opposite is true for villages with scattered land.
    Among the above five items, the first, second, and third items should be evaluated according to the investigation, and the fourth and fifth items should focus on studying their laws, discovering problems, and rechecking them. These five items are closely linked, a series, and indispensable.
    In addition to the above five basic items, attention should also be paid to various related issues according to the specific circumstances. Such as:
    (1) In areas with special products, attention must be paid to the amount of income from special products, the proportion of income from special products to agricultural income, and the average income from special products per person.
    (2) The issue of belonging to people or land. If the provincial government stipulates that land outside the township is still counted and levied in the township, attention must be paid to the amount of land outside the township and its tax rate. For example, in Qingping Fourth Bao, Changde County, Hunan, landlords in other villages have a lot of land in this village. According to "levying according to the land," the average tax rate of the whole village is 25.7%. If "levying according to the person," the average tax rate of the whole village is 15.8%. The difference is very large.
    (3) Land that cannot be calculated by the average agricultural population:
    The above is the general process of verifying the tax amount, which must meet certain conditions to be carried out according to the above steps. Obviously, this year, many areas are difficult to do step by step due to the urgency of time. So what should we do?
    In this case, the blindness in the allocation of tasks is difficult to completely avoid, but various methods should be taken to reduce it as much as possible. The method is:
    1. Before the general distribution, "we should send capable cadres to conduct typical experiments of collecting agricultural tax as much as possible." The selection of typical villages should preferably be in three types of villages, rich, middle, and poor, and select a village with concentrated land and a village with scattered land in each category, evaluate the yield, calculate the tax amount, and then refer to the above-mentioned review items to carefully study to initially understand the general law.
    2. According to the survey data and the laws of typical villages, repeated research and comparison can make a preliminary estimate of the total amount of collection in each village for internal reference.
    3. Universally promote each village to check black land, evaluate yield, and calculate tax amount. If the verification of the tax amount is too late to wait for each village to report it to a meeting for evaluation, county and district cadres can be sent to go deep into the districts and villages to review them village by village, put forward opinions, and report them to the county for verification at any time.
    4. In the future, the collection of number books should not only pay attention to the statistics of population, land, and yield, but also pay attention to the statistics of "converted income" and "verified tax amount," and pay attention to the ratio between the two, so as to lay the foundation for further implementing "verified tax amount" next year. In areas where land reform is not implemented this year, special attention should be paid to this issue.
  (III) Conclusion
    Of course, the basic key to fair burden is the authenticity of the land area and yield survey, but even if the land yield survey is true in the new area, if the task is simply allocated according to the land yield, it will still not be possible to "tax according to the rate" and act according to the policy. Since the rectification of the party and cadres, everyone has had a considerable understanding of the harm of commandism and the importance of acting in accordance with policies and laws. However, we must also find a set of specific methods for implementing policies in order to completely overcome various deviations in our work. The above are just some preliminary opinions, hoping that this can arouse the attention of comrades in various regions and seek more secure and more detailed methods from practice and research.

　　怎样核定新区农业税额
    李成瑞
    新解放区农业税暂行条例第十七条规定：“纳税户的土地亩数、产量和人口，由乡（村）人民政府组织包括各阶层代表在内的农业税调查评议委员会进行调查评议，并依本条例的规定计算各户应交税额，填造农业税清册，报送县（市）人民政府核定之”，第二十条规定“农作物收获后，乡（村）人民政府根据县（市）人民政府核定的税额，列榜公告。……”这两条中所规定的“核定税额”，是统一税率和任务而言的。这是农业税条例执行中的一个重要问题，有提出来和各地同志讨论的必要。
  （一）为什么要“核定税额”？
    “核定税额”的目的，是要严格实现“依率计征”，保证国家财政收入，平衡农村负担。是针对去年农业税执行中的两种偏向提出的：
    第一种偏向：是根据总的人口、地亩数和产量，盲目地自上而下按相同的税率分配税收任务，例如甲村二百五十人五百亩地，产量十万斤，乙村二百五十人一千亩地，产量二十万斤，同按百分之十三的税率，分配甲村一万三千斤，乙村二万六千斤的任务。但根据条例规定，须“以户为单位，按农业人口每人平均农业收入累进计征”（新区农业税条例第二条和第十二条），而自耕地、出租地和佃耕地，又因收入性质不同须分别予以折算（条例第十五条）。这样依率计征之后，甲村（每人收入四百斤，较穷）全村的平均税率，必然少于１３％，乙村（每人平均收入八百斤，较富）则必然多于１３％。可见简单地按同一税率分配的“任务”与“依率计征”的结果并不相符，任务与政策（税率）便发生矛盾。这种矛盾在省分配到县时还不太显著，而在县分配到村时就十分显著了，这里，就手头材料举出几个实例：
    （１）土地集中的程度差不多，但贫富不同的两个村，按山东办法，依率计征的结果，全村平均税率（全村税额占全村收入的比例），富村高于贫村约６％。如山东齐河县大林格庄——每人平均收入３２１斤——全村平均税率１２．１８％。山东齐河县邱庄——每人平均收入５４８斤——全村平均税率１９．０９％。
    （２）贫富差不多，但土地集中程度不同、租佃地多少不同的两个村，依率计征的结果，全村平均税率相差约１０％。如浙江金华县金店村——每人平均收入７１２．５斤——全村平均税率１２．０５％。如四川巴县长生乡五保——每人平均收入７０６．８３斤——全村平均税率２２．７１％。
    如果单纯按总土地产量依平均税率分配“任务”，则贫苦村、土地分散村、佃耕地多的村庄依率计征，就不能完成任务，就会形成额外加派、挤大户、压小户等违犯政策的现象；而富庶村，土地集中村，出租地多的村庄依率计征，就会超过任务，可能为贪污分子所乘，或是普遍减轻，同样也违反政策。
    第二种偏向是单纯按各地自报产量，不问虚实，在产量调查不彻底的基础上，实行“依率计征”。而由于各村各户所报的产量有实有虚，结果必然是“实报的吃亏，虚报的讨巧”。譬如甲、乙二人依自报产量所定税率同为１４％，甲的真实性为百分之百，乙的真实性为百分之七十，结果，乙的税率实际只有９．８％，客观上等于奖励虚报少报。有些群众反映我们“鞭打快牛”（老实人负担重），确是很中肯的。因为这种办法在“公平合理”，“依率计征”的外衣下，掩盖了畸轻畸重、违反税率的实质，有时且有使国家收入落空的危险。
    去年征粮工作有许多困难条件，粗糙是难免的，但今年就必须尽量克服了。去年征粮中前一种偏向是主要的，后一种是少数的，两种偏向形式虽然不同，结果都是一样——使税率与任务矛盾，条例不能贯彻。今年在着重纠正“命令主义”和“单纯任务观点”之后，后一种偏向还有发展的可能，故有特别加以注意的必要。
    为了克服去年的偏向，为了贯彻“依率计征”，以保证国家财政收入，平衡农村负担，除了大力调查土地产量而外，“核定税率”的规定，也是要努力实现的。
  （二）怎样“核定税额”？
    “核定税额”的方法，还没有成熟的经验。这里仅述个人所见，提供参考：
    （一）步骤——首先应以主要力量“认真调查纳税户的土地亩数、产量和人口以及租佃关系等情况，同时依靠农民群众，揭发隐瞒土地，虚报产量和逃避负担等情形，然后根据农业税暂行条例的规定，计算和评议各户应交税额”，并依条例第十七条的规定造册上报，由县区政府逐项审查（审查项目见后），提出意见。在可能条件下最好再交付各界人民代表会讨论决定。如果县人民政府不能逐户具体依率计出其核定税额，可集合各村干部在区人民政府改算，或发还各村由村依核定产量收入及审查意见，再报县核准征收。
    （二）核定项目：（１）基本项目有五：
    １、农业人口、土地亩数和每人平均土地亩数。
    ２、每亩常年产量：应分别水、旱、坡地反复评比。
    ３、每人平均产量：每人平均产量是每人平均土地和每亩平均产量的集中表现。
    ４、全村常年收入和全村折合收入，所谓常年收入，即全村各户按土地常年产量应得收入的总额；所谓折合收入，即按条例第十五条加二成、减二成的办法折算后的收入，其多少决定于出租地和佃耕地的多少。
    ５、全村总税额及其占全村折合收入百分比：逐户依率算出全村总税额后，以折合收入除之，即得全村平均税率。大体的说，土地集中的村庄，全村平均税率应高于该村每人平均折合收入在税率表上所载的税率；土地分散的村则反是。
    以上五项中第一、二、三项应根据调查加以评定，第四项第五项则应着重研究其规律，发现问题，加以复核。这五项是紧密结合的、一系列的、缺一不可的。
    除了上述五个基本项目外，还应按具体情况，注意各项有关问题。如：
    （一）有特产的地区，须注意特产收入的多少、特产收入与农业收入的比例及每人平均特产收入等数字。
    （二）属人属地问题，如果省府规定地在外乡仍属本乡计征，即须注意外乡土地的多少及其税率，例如湖南常德县青平第四保，外村地主在本村土地很多，按“属地征收”，全村平均税率为２５．７％如“属人征收”，则全村平均税率１５．８％。其间差别很大。
    （三）不能以农业人口平均计算的土地：
    上面谈的，是核定税额的一般过程，它必须具备一定条件，才能按上述步骤进行，很显然今年还有许多地区，由于时间迫促，难以按步就班做到。那又怎么办呢？
    在这种情况下，分配任务时的盲目性是难以完全避免的，但应采取种种方法尽力使之减少。其法为：
    １、在普遍分配之前，“应尽可能派出得力干部进行征收农业税的典型试验”。典型村的选择，最好在富、中、贫三类村庄中，每类各选一个土地集中的村庄和一个土地分散的村庄，评好产量，算出税额，然后参照上述审查项目，仔细研究，以初步了解一般规律。
    ２、根据调查数字及典型村的规律，反复研究比较，可对各村征收总额作一初步估计，供内部参考。
    ３、普遍推动各村查黑地，评产量，计算税额。如果税额的核定来不及等各村报齐后开会评定，可派县、区干部深入区、村，逐村审查，提出意见，随时报县核定。
    ４、今后对数字册籍的收集，不仅要注意到人口、土地、产量的统计，还要注意到“折合收入”“核定税额”的统计，并注意两者的比例，这样才能打下明年进一步实行“核定税额”的基础。在今年不实行土改的地区，应特别注意这一问题。
  （三）结语
    当然，负担公平的基本关键，在于土地亩数和产量调查的真实，但在新区即使土地产量调查真实，如果单纯按土地产量分配任务，仍旧作不到“依率计征”和按政策办事的。自从整党整干以来，大家对命令主义的害处和按照政策、法令办事的重要性，都有了相当认识。但是我们还必须找出一套执行政策的具体方法，才能完全克服工作中的各种偏向。以上仅是些初步意见，希望由此能引起各地同志的注意，从实践与研究中去寻求更安善与更详尽的办法。
