Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Li Lisan, Deputy Head of the Chinese People's Delegation and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, who returned after visiting Korea, recently spoke to our reporter about what he personally witnessed during the delegation's visit to Korea: the heroic struggle of the Korean workers for the victory of the liberation war.

In the Korean people's war of resistance against American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique, it was the Korean working class that first responded to General Kim Il-sung's call for general mobilization, and united and motivated the Korean peasants and other classes of people with their actions.

In addition to actively joining the army and fighting the enemy on the front lines, Korean workers also shouldered the enormous task of increasing production in the rear to ensure a continuous supply to the front lines. The total number of workers in North Korea is 660,000, of whom 200,000 have gone to the front lines. The workers who remained in the rear launched a "shock movement" to complete the work left behind by the workers who went to the front lines. 100,000 workers have participated in the "shock movement." At the same time, many women have also entered the mines and factories to take over their work.

The rear work during the war inevitably encountered many difficulties. First, the production structure had to be reorganized due to the transition from peace to war. Second, some workers went to the front lines, affecting production in the rear. Third, there were also difficulties in guaranteeing wartime transportation. However, for the liberation of their motherland, the Korean workers are overcoming all difficulties with the high degree of organization and selfless labor of the working class, ensuring continuous support for the liberation war.

Under the slogan of "Everything for the Front, Everything for Victory in the War," Korean workers voluntarily extended their eight-hour workdays to twelve hours. They donated their overtime and holiday wages to the state. Production teams with workers who went to the front lines ensured that production would not be reduced under the slogan of one person doing the work of two, while those production teams without workers who went to the front lines carried out a "doubling movement" to increase production. Each worker's machine is affixed with a slogan stating that for the sake of victory, they are determined to make greater contributions than before the war in terms of improving productivity, improving quality, and saving raw materials. Each of them has a liberation war manual that records their achievements. These achievements will be announced after the war is won. Now, thanks to the workers' enthusiasm and creativity, amazing results have been achieved. For example, a machine in a factory that used to require ten people to operate now only requires two people to manage after being modified, and the number of machine rotations has increased sixfold. A certain machinery factory exceeded the production plan by two to three times. Miner Xu Taisong from a certain mine completed three and a half times his plan.

The indiscriminate bombing by American planes did not discourage the Korean workers, but strengthened their determination to win victory. The workers said: American planes are not scary, what is scary is the idea of ​​believing in American planes. For example, after a factory in Pyongyang was bombed, the workers immediately carried out repairs, and the output after the repairs was greatly increased compared to before. The tin furnace of a chemical factory in a certain place was damaged by bombing, and it normally takes three months to repair, but this time it only took thirteen days.

In order to ensure military transportation, the Korean railway workers demonstrated a high degree of patriotism, bravely and perseveringly maintaining the operation of the national railway lines under the crazy bombing of American planes, and greatly improving the efficiency of operation and traction compared to before the war.

After the outbreak of the war, the Korean railway workers called for full support for the front lines and immediately launched a competition movement. All the train drivers once swore that they were determined to drive out the American invaders. They increased the train traction from the standard of eighteen cars to twenty-two cars. The freight car congestion accidents that occurred from time to time before the war have never happened since the liberation war, and the transportation volume has also been increased. Safe operation has not had any accidents. Sometimes the locomotive is damaged by enemy planes, and the brave drivers immediately repair it regardless of their own safety, without delaying the operation of the train. Thanks to the efforts of the railway workers, not only has the railway transportation volume been increased, but also the accumulated goods before the war have been cleared. The most vivid example of the railway workers' heroic struggle is the struggle to protect the Han River Iron Bridge. From June 28th to August 18th, American imperialist planes bombed the iron bridge 2,200 times, dropping more than 5,460 bombs. The railway workers in Seoul often persisted in the repair work under the bombing and strafing of enemy planes. The enemy bombed during the day and repaired during the day, and bombed at night and repaired at night. It was bombed and destroyed more than fifty times, and it was repaired more than fifty times. In this way, the Seoul railway workers assisted the People's Army in crossing the river and supplied the front lines with resources from the rear.

The Korean working class has been tempered to be stronger in the liberation war, and has played the heroic spirit and exemplary role of the working class, further consolidating the fighting unity of the entire people, which determines that the Korean people will surely achieve the final victory in the anti-aggression war.

　　朝鲜工人阶级为胜利而斗争
    李立三访问朝鲜归来后发表谈话
    【新华社三十日讯】访问朝鲜后返国的中国人民代表团副团长、中华全国总工会副主席李立三，顷对本社记者畅谈代表团访问朝鲜期间所亲自见闻的朝鲜工人为争取解放战争胜利而英勇斗争的情形。
    在朝鲜人民反抗美帝国主义和李承晚傀儡集团的解放战争中，首先响应金日成将军的总动员号召，并且以行动团结和带动朝鲜农民和其他阶层人民的，是朝鲜的工人阶级。
    朝鲜工人除了积极参军亲身上前线杀敌以外，还在后方担负了增加生产，保证不断供应前线的巨大任务。北朝鲜的工人总数是六十六万，已有二十万人上前线。留在后方的工人发动了“突击运动”，完成上前线的工人所留下的工作。参加“突击运动”的工人已达十万人。同时，许多妇女也纷纷进入矿山、工厂，接替他们的工作。
    战时的后方工作不可免地遇到了许多困难。第一、由和平转入战争，生产机构必须改组。第二、有的工人到前线去，影响后方生产。第三、战时运输保证也有困难。然而，朝鲜工人为了祖国的解放，正以工人阶级高度的组织性和忘我的劳动，克服着一切困难，保证不断地支援解放战争。
    在“一切为了前线，一切为了战争胜利”的口号下，朝鲜工人自动地把每天八小时的工作延长到十二小时。加班和假日的工资都献给国家。有工人上前线的生产小组，都在一个人做两个人的工作口号下，保证不减少生产，而没有工人上前线的那些生产小组，就进行着增加生产的“倍加运动”。每个工人的机器上都贴着标语，说明为了胜利，自己决心在提高生产率、提高质量、节约原料等方面，比战前作更多的贡献。他们每人都有一个解放战争手册，记录着自己的成绩。这些成绩将在战争胜利以后公布。现在，由于工人的积极性和创造性，已经获得了惊人的成绩。例如，某工厂过去需要十个人工作的机器，经改造后只需两个人管理，而且机器轮转次数却增加到六倍。某机械工厂超过生产计划两倍到三倍。某矿山的矿工许太松完成了计划的三倍半。
    美机的滥炸不但没有使朝鲜工人灰心丧气，反而加强了他们争取胜利的决心。工人们说：美国飞机不可怕，可怕的是迷信美国飞机的思想。例如，平壤的一家工厂被炸以后，工人马上就进行修复工作，而且修复后比以前还要大大提高产量。某地的某化学工厂的锡炉被炸坏，平时需要三个月才能修复，但是这次只用了十三天。
    为了保证军事运输，朝鲜铁路工人发挥了高度的爱国主义精神，勇敢、坚忍地使全国的铁路干线在美机的疯狂滥炸下始终保持运转，而且比战前大大地提高了运转牵引的效率。
    战争爆发后，朝鲜铁路工人号召全力支援前线，而且立刻展开了竞赛运动。全体火车司机曾经宣誓，决心把美国侵略者赶出去。他们把列车牵引量从十八辆的标准提高到二十二辆。战前不时发生的货车堵塞事故，解放战争以来从未发生过，而且又提高了运输量。安全运转也没有发生过事故。有时机车被敌机炸坏，英勇的司机们就不顾生命危险，立即修复，不误列车的运转。由于铁路工人的努力，不但提高了铁路运输量，而且肃清了战前的积货。铁路工人英勇斗争的最生动的一个例子，是保护汉江大铁桥的斗争。从六月二十八日起到八月十八日止，美帝飞机轰炸这座铁桥达二千二百次，投弹五千四百六十多枚。汉城的铁路工人经常在敌机的轰炸扫射下坚持抢修工作，敌人白天炸就白天修、黑夜炸就黑夜修，被炸毁五十多次，就修复五十多次。就是这样，汉城铁路工人协助了人民军渡江作战，并且把后方物资源源供应前线。
    朝鲜工人阶级在解放战争中已经锻炼得更为坚强了，发挥了工人阶级的英勇精神和模范作用，更加巩固了全体人民的战斗的团结，这就决定了朝鲜人民必将取得反侵略战争的最后胜利。
