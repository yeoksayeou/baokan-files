    [Xinhua News Agency, Dusseldorf, 30th] The German News Agency, Dusseldorf, reported: In the German Labor Corps in Anbach, 56 young people were recently immediately dismissed for refusing to serve as soldiers for the United States. These heroic young people issued a statement in response, calling on German youth to refuse to be cannon fodder for the United States.

    The statement said: We refuse to act as mercenaries because we love our motherland and are unwilling to sell it out. Although we face unemployment and poverty, we refuse to serve as soldiers. We firmly believe that in doing so, we are fulfilling our responsibility to be loyal to our motherland. We call on all honest patriots in Germany, especially the youth, regardless of party or belief, to refuse to serve as soldiers! Refuse to serve as foreign mercenaries! Oppose any war preparations in our country! Join us in the struggle for peace!
