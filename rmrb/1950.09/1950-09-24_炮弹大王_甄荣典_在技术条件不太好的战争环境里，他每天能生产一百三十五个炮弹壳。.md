　　"Cannonball King" Zhen Rongdian
    In a war environment with poor technical conditions, he could produce one hundred and thirty-five shell casings every day.
    He Wei
    The eight-year Anti-Japanese War behind enemy lines created the glorious and immortal epic of the Chinese people. Recalling those arduous years, the more valuable Zhen Rongdian's exemplary achievements seem. His selfless labor is the source of our victory. At that time, the Taihang Mountain Anti-Japanese Base Area was subjected to repeated mopping-up operations by Japanese invaders and puppet troops. The enemy's cruel destruction and strict economic blockade created unimaginable difficulties. In this situation, iron will and tenacious struggle were needed! From an ordinary worker, we can see how the soldiers and civilians behind enemy lines withstood the test in the long war.
  Manufacturing More Cannonballs to Eliminate the Enemy
    In 1940, Zhen Rongdian voluntarily requested the Party to transfer him to work at the front. Soon, he was introduced to the Huangyandong Arsenal of the military industry department in the Taihang Mountains as an apprentice. He earned the glorious title of "Cannonball King" with an astonishing record of making the outer circle of a 50mm shell in seventy-five seconds. From the time he was an apprentice, he had been doing this hard and heavy work. His weight decreased rapidly with the speed of the lathe. Other workers couldn't endure the physical strain and had to change jobs after only two or three months. However, Zhen Rongdian deeply understood the needs of the motherland. He stood firmly at his post, persevering by the water wheel for five years, creating new records time and time again: two hundred, three hundred... finally reaching a record of four hundred and eighty 50mm shell outer circles in one day. His enthusiastic contribution to the victory of the motherland was entirely based on his irreconcilable national hatred for the Japanese invaders. Zhen Rongdian said, "As long as it is beneficial to the front line, I will continue to do it."
  Bravely Protecting the Factory, Not Allowing the Loss of a Single Screw!
    The Japanese invaders were terrified of the People's Liberation Army's cannonballs. The best proof of this is that each time the enemy carried out a destructive encirclement and suppression of the base areas, they targeted the military industry as their primary objective. Every Communist Party member and the people of the base areas, who loved their motherland, held boundless hatred for those Japanese fascist bandits who specialized in looting and bravely persisted in the struggle against the enemy. During the Japanese mopping-up operations, Zhen Rongdian always stood at the forefront of the struggle, devising various ingenious ways to protect the machines and avoid the enemy's destruction. When the machines were buried, he immediately picked up the "Type 65" rifle that he had never left for five years and became a brave self-defense team member. In the winter of 1940, he and more than a thousand worker brothers successfully completed the Hualong Mountain breakout. During the large-scale mopping-up operation in May 1942, the enemy surrounded the Taihang Mountains so tightly that not even water could leak through, combing through the barren mountains and cliffs for a month. At that time, all the factory workers were ordered to move far away. However, Zhen Rongdian was unwilling to leave the factory too far and voluntarily stayed in the enemy's encirclement with several self-defense team members, persisting in the struggle against the enemy. Whenever the searching enemy reached the place where the machines were buried, they would fire at the enemy on the surrounding mountains to distract them, protecting the revolutionary property with their lives.
    Unable to find the machines, the enemy frantically burned the Huangyandong Arsenal to ashes. Individual weak-willed elements began to waver. Zhen Rongdian, this stubborn fighter who had been born and died for the Communist Party and cultivated by them, said: "Revolution is like this. There is no place in the liberated areas that the enemy cannot reach, but there is also no place where the enemy can stand. No matter how fierce the enemy is, we will drive them out. What does it matter if the houses are burned down? We will rebuild them!" Therefore, he worked hard to rebuild the factory. Three days after the end of another anti-mopping-up war, before the factory buildings could be repaired, the machines were already running.
  Uniting Everyone to Do a Good Job in Production
    On the eve of Japan's surrender, a new 82mm shell factory was established by the military industry department. It had been in operation for a long time, but the output was always very low. At that time, Zhen Rongdian had only been studying technology at the experimental institute for less than two months. Although the superiors thought of Zhen Rongdian, the instructor felt that he should continue to study and not be transferred back. Later, when he found out, he went to the instructor and said, "I am still young, and there are many opportunities to learn technology. It is better to obey the needs of the war!" When Zhen Rongdian arrived at the 82mm shell factory, he not only took the lead in doing the work himself, but also united the veteran masters, the workers, and the apprentices to work together. As a result, the production volume increased step by step with his record. On his first day of work, Zhen Rongdian produced forty-five 82mm shells, more than double that of an average craftsman. Later, he increased it to eighty, and other workers also increased their production to fifty per day. The military industry department praised him: "Wherever Zhen Rongdian goes, the work there is done excellently!"
    Zhen Rongdian had a strong mass viewpoint. Japan announced its surrender but refused to immediately disarm. The Kuomintang bandit army took the opportunity to attack the liberated areas. The war on the front line was very intense, and the demand for shells increased several times. How could the task be completed? Zhen Rongdian suggested: "For such a big task, it is not enough to just have meetings at the top. The task must be discussed among the masses and turned into the workers' own plan." The leaders followed their suggestions. As a result, the workers were very enthusiastic about production. In the first month, the entire factory completed the task, and Zhen Rongdian exceeded the plan. With frequent victories on the front line, Zhen Rongdian issued a challenge at the workers' congress: "Guarantee the supply of shell casings to the front-line troops and ensure that the front line has enough shells to annihilate the enemy." He used his spare time to process and improve the installation of the grooving tool. The original assault mission was for one month, but the front line urgently needed shells, so the production in the rear became even more intense. During the heavy labor, he injured two toes when they were hit by an iron roller. He bandaged the wounds, put his feet on a low stool, and continued to work hard, creating an amazing record of producing one hundred and thirty-five shell casings per day. The shells they produced powerfully supported the War of Liberation. In the battles of Handan and Shangdang on the front line, where Chiang Kai-shek's invading army was completely annihilated, the shells exerted tremendous power.
  Saw the Soviet Worker Brothers
    In the autumn of 1948, Zhen Rongdian visited Moscow. During his visit to the Soviet Union, his confidence in the construction of his motherland was greatly enhanced.
    He visited the Kremlin. He was particularly impressed by the carriages used by the Tsarist Russian emperors, which were displayed in the palace's history museum. Because these carriages were manufactured so clumsily, he was reminded of the Tsarist era, when the Soviet Union was still a backward agricultural country. He also saw the Soviet people's great achievements in eliminating the wounds of war on the ruins destroyed by German fascists. This made him firmly believe that with such a brilliant example from the Soviet Union, we China are fully confident in building a prosperous and strong new China. After returning home, he wrote some articles on "Impressions of a Visit to the Soviet Union," one of which reads:
    "I saw the labor enthusiasm and constructiveness of Soviet women. The women of our new China should learn these advantages. How should we learn? That is, we should strengthen our labor viewpoint and improve our cultural and political theoretical level. This is an important condition for us to build a new China and transform an agricultural country into an industrial country."
    Zhen Rongdian was born into a poor peasant family in Tang County, Hebei. His father farmed the land, his mother ground tofu. From a young age, he went up the mountains to collect firewood and became a hired worker at the age of sixteen. His family was heavily in debt and could not even eat their fill of chaff and vegetables, so he never had the opportunity to study. He often thought: "I was oppressed and exploited in the old society and had no opportunity to learn culture. During the ten years of war, I relaxed my studies in order to complete the task of arms production. The task of construction will be even more arduous in the future. What if I cannot shoulder the work assigned by the superiors? For the sake of future national defense construction and to better serve the motherland, I must work hard to improve my political, cultural, and technical level."
  Determined to Study Hard
    Now Zhen Rongdian is living his ideal learning life. Last October, the leaders sent him to a certain military industrial vocational school to study. Zhen Rongdian studies very seriously. When he attended the Shanxi Provincial Workers' Congress last November, he also brought his arithmetic textbook and often took remedial classes during breaks. Every arithmetic test he always scored above ninety.
    Through ten years of labor, war life, and school life, Zhen Rongdian has been molded into a typical representative of the Chinese advanced working class. (Attached picture)

　　“炮弹大王”甄荣典
    在技术条件不太好的战争环境里，他每天能生产一百三十五个炮弹壳。
    何微
    敌后八年抗日战争创造了中国人民光荣不朽的史诗，回想起那些艰苦岁月，愈觉得甄荣典的模范业迹之可贵。他那忘我的劳动，就是我们所以能胜利的泉源。那时，太行山抗日根据地处在日寇和伪军的反复扫荡中，敌人的残酷破坏和严密的经济封锁，造成难以想像的困难。在这种情况下，需要铁的意志和坚忍的斗争！我们从一个普通工人身上，就可以知道，敌后军民是怎样在长期战争中经受考验的。
  制造更多的炮弹消灭敌人
    一九四○年，甄荣典自动要求党调他去前方工作。不久被介绍到太行山的军工部黄烟洞兵工厂做学徒。他以七十五秒钟做一发五零炮弹外圆的惊人纪录，获得“炮弹大王”的光荣称号。他从当学徒时候起，一直就干着这件苦重的工作，体重随着旋力的速度很快消瘦下来，别的工人都因体力支不住，干不到三两个月就要调换工作；但甄荣典深知祖国的需要，他坚定地站在自己的岗位上，一直在水力轮带旁坚持了五年，一天二百、三百……一次一次地创造新纪录，最后达到了一天四百八十发五零炮弹外圆的纪录。他对祖国胜利的热忱供献，完全是基于他对日寇不可调和的民族仇恨。甄荣典说：“只要对前线有利，我就干下去。”
  英勇保护工厂，一个螺丝钉也不让损失！
    日寇对解放军的炮弹是恐惧的，从敌人每一次对根据地毁灭性的清剿都以军事工业为其主要目标就是最好的证明。热爱祖国的每一个共产党员和根据地人民，对于那些专事掳掠的日本法西斯匪徒，带着无限地愤恨，英勇地坚持了对敌斗争。在日寇扫荡时，甄荣典始终站在斗争的最前边，想出种种巧妙办法保护机器，来避开敌人的破坏。当埋好了机器，他立刻拿起五年来从未离开过的那枝“六五”步枪，变成英勇的自卫队员。一九四○年冬天，他和一千多工人兄弟在一起，胜利完成华龙山突围。一九四二年五月大扫荡，敌人把太行山围得水泄不通，像篦梳一般在荒山绝岩里清剿了一个月。那时全厂工人都奉命令向远处转移；但甄荣典不愿意离开工厂太远，自动和几个自卫队员留在敌人的清剿圈内，跟敌人坚持斗争。每当搜索的敌人走到埋藏机器的地方，他们就在周围山上向敌人开枪射击，将敌人吸引开来，用生命保护革命财产。
    敌人找不到机器，疯狂地将黄烟洞兵工厂房舍，烧成一片灰烬。个别意志薄弱的分子开始动摇了，曾经出生入死，为共产党培育出来的这位倔强的战士——甄荣典说：“革命就是这样。解放区没有敌人到不了的地方，可也没有一处地方让敌人站住脚。任敌人凶暴，也打出去了。烧掉房屋算啥？垮了再来！”于是，他紧张地从事于重建工厂的劳动。在另一次反扫荡战争结束后的第三天，兵工厂的房舍还未来得及修好，机器已经开动了。
  团结大家搞好生产
    日本投降的前夕，军工部新成立了一座八二炮弹厂，开工很久，产量一直很低。当时甄荣典刚到实验所学技术还不到两个月。上级虽然想到甄荣典；但指导员觉得应该让他学习，不能又去调他回来。后来被他知道了，就去找指导员说：“我年纪还轻，学技术的机会很多，还是服从战争的需要好！”甄荣典到了八二炮弹厂，不仅自己带头去做，又团结老师傅，团结工人，团结学徒一起去干，于是生产量也随着他的纪录步步提高。甄荣典上工的第一天就出四十五个八二大炮弹，超过一般工匠一倍；以后他又增到八十个，别的工人也增到一天出五十个。军工部赞扬他：“甄荣典走到那里，那里的工作就搞的呱呱叫！”
    甄荣典的群众观点很强。日本宣布投降，但拒绝立即缴械，国民党匪军乘机进攻解放区，前线战争很紧张，需要炮弹增加好几倍，如何完成任务呢？甄荣典就提意见：“这样大的任务，光靠上面开会不行，要把任务拿到群众中去讨论，变成工人自己的计划才行。”领导上根据他们意见办了，这样一来，工人们生产很起劲，第一个月全厂就完成了任务，甄荣典则超过了计划。前线捷报频传，甄荣典在职工大会上提出挑战书：“保证前线部队的弹壳供应，一定让前线有足够的炮弹歼灭敌人。”他利用空隙时间加工，又改进了切槽刀的安装。原定突击任务是一个月，但前方需用炮弹很急，后方的生产也就更紧张了。在繁重的劳动中，他被铁滚砸伤两个脚趾，他把伤口包扎起来，将脚放到一条矮凳上，又继续紧张地工作，创造每天生产一百三十五发弹壳的惊人纪录。他们生产的炮弹，有力地支援了解放战争。在邯郸前线和上党前线，全歼蒋介石进犯军的战役中，炮弹发挥了强大的威力。
  看到了苏联的工人弟兄
    一九四八年秋天，甄荣典访问了莫斯科。在访苏期间，大大地增强了他对自己祖国建设的信心。
    他曾参观了克里姆林宫。对他印象特别深刻的是帝俄沙皇御用的马车，陈列在宫内历史博物馆。因为这些马车制造的粗笨，就使他联想到沙皇时代，苏联还是落后的农业国。他又看到苏联人民曾在德国法西斯破坏的废墟上，消灭了战争创伤的丰功伟绩。使他深信，我们中国有了苏联这样光辉的榜样，要建设一个富强的新中国是有充分把握的。他回国之后，写了一些“访苏观感”的文章，其中有一段写道：
    “我看到苏联妇女的劳动积极性和建设性，我们新中国的妇女应该学习这些优点。怎样学习呢？就是加强自己的劳动观点，提高自己的文化和政治理论水平，这是我们建设新中国，变农业国为工业国的重要条件。”
    甄荣典生在河北唐县一家贫农家庭，父亲种地，母亲磨豆腐，他自小上山打柴，十六岁便当雇工，家里负债很多，糠菜都吃不饱，所以从来没读过书。他常想：“自己在旧社会受压迫受剥削，没有学习文化的机会，十来年的战争生活，为了完成军火生产任务，放松了学习，今后建设的任务更繁重了，上级交给工作万一担负不下来，怎么办？为了今后国防建设，使自己更好的为祖国服务，我一定要努力提高政治，文化，技术水平。”
  决心好好学习
    现在甄荣典正过着他理想的学习生活。去年十月领导上送他到某地兵工职业学校学习。甄荣典学习非常认真。去年十一月出席山西省工代大会时，他还带着算术课本，经常在休息时间补课，每次的算术考试总在九十分以上。
    在十年劳动、战争生活和学校生活的锻炼中，甄荣典塑造成了中国先进工人阶级的典型。（附图片）
