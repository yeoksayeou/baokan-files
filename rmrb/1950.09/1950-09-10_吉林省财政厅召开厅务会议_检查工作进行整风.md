(Jilin News) According to the Jilin Daily News: The Jilin Provincial Government's Department of Finance, began studying rectification documents in connection with the actual situation in July. After the beginning of August, combined with the specific situation of the department and the materials obtained from the recent inspection of the financial affairs of various counties and the financial affairs of enterprises, the department meeting was held to inspect the work. First, criticism and self-criticism were carried out from the leadership, and a preliminary inspection was conducted, revealing many shortcomings: (1) The guiding principle of actively developing production and opening up financial resources, and transforming the financial supply into financial services for production, has not been sufficiently implemented and executed. For example: It was proposed at the December financial meeting last year to accumulate funds and invest heavily in production, but the specific arrangements for implementing this policy were insufficient. It was not until April of this year that we began to focus on inspecting county-run enterprises and initially formulated a financial supervision plan for provincial-run enterprises. In terms of developing production, insufficient agricultural investment was made in Yushu and Panshi counties, and it was not timely enough, which affected the use of funds. On the issue of taxation, whether it is for national tax or local tax, the active leadership and regular supervision and inspection have not been done sufficiently.

	(2) The idea of ​​careful accounting and planning is not well implemented. For example, regarding the investment in the Yushu County sack factory and paper mill, the county initially requested an investment of 2 billion, and after reviewing the plan, 1 billion (Northeast currency, same below) was invested; but when the county requested an increase in investment for the second time, although personnel were sent to the site for review, no problems were found, and the county's request was answered with another investment of 2 billion; until Yushu County finally proposed an increase of 10 billion to complete the original production plan, the leadership began to pay attention. After sending people to inspect, it was discovered that the basic problem that the county's power generation capacity did not match the expected electricity demand of the sack factory and paper mill had not been resolved, so the county was ordered to stop operation. In addition, the clothing company and printing factory operated by the department have not achieved precise economic accounting and poor management.

	(3) The division of labor within the department is not clear enough. Some departments have overlapping work, while others have no one to manage. Leading comrades are busy with daily trivial matters and revising documents, which leads to in-depth work, thorough consideration of major issues, and the work falling into a passive state. Even some plans and summaries have not been formulated in line with the actual situation through meeting discussions, so it has not been possible to learn from the planning work and summary work, improve cadres, and prevent plans and summaries from becoming formalities.

	(4) In the supply business, the mass viewpoint is not sufficient. We only care about completing the supply work, regardless of the effect of the work. For example: issuing toothpaste regardless of quality, issuing shoes without considering specifications, so some supplies cannot be used, resulting in waste. After the above problems were initially exposed, the organization will first be rectified according to needs, organizational regulations and work rules will be formulated, a regular work system will be improved, problems that can be solved immediately will be solved at any time, and work will continue to be inspected in depth.

　　吉林省财政厅召开厅务会议
    检查工作进行整风
    【吉林讯】据吉林日报消息：吉林省府财政厅，从七月份开始联系实际学习整风文件，八月初以后，结合该厅具体情况及最近检查各县财政、企业财务工作中所得材料，以厅务会议形式进入检查工作。首先自领导上展开批评与自我批评，进行了初步检查，发现不少缺点：（一）积极发展生产开辟财源，把供给财政转变成为生产服务的财政方针贯彻与执行的不够。如：去年十二月财政会议上提出积累资金，大力投向生产，但贯彻这一方针的具体布置却不够。及至今年四月始抓紧对各县营企业进行检查，对省营企业初步制定了财务监督计划。在发展生产上，对榆树、磐石县应进行农业投资而做得不够，同时也不很及时，致影响资金运用。在税收问题上，不论对国税或地方税，积极的领导与经常的督促检查也都是做得很不够的。
    （二）贯彻精密核算的思想及计划性不够。如对榆树县麻袋工厂、造纸厂的投资，第一次该县要求投资二十亿，经过审查计划后，投了十亿（东北币，下同）；但第二次该县要求增加投资时，虽经派员至现地审查，但没有发现问题，答复了该县的要求，又投资二十亿；及至最后榆树县又提出增加一百亿才能完成原定生产计划时，始引起领导方面的重视。经派人检查后，发现了该县发电能力与预定发展之麻袋工厂、造纸厂之需电量不相适应的基本问题尚未解决，遂令该县停办。另如该厅经营的被服公司、印刷厂，皆未做到精密的经济核算及经营管理不善。
    （三）厅内分工不够明确，有的科工作重叠，有的工作又无人专管，领导同志忙于日常烦琐事务、批改文件，致深入工作、周密考虑重大问题，使工作陷于被动。甚至某些计划与总结亦未能切合实际的经过会议研究讨论来拟订，因此亦未能从计划工作、总结工作中吸取经验，提高干部，使计划与总结不致流于形式。
    （四）在供给业务上表现了群众观点不够，只顾完成供给工作，不看工作的效果如何。如：发牙膏不顾质量，发鞋子不考虑规格，因此有些供给品不能使用，形成浪费。以上诸问题经初步揭发后，首先按需要整顿机构，制订组织规程与工作细则，健全正规的工作制度，随时解决马上可以解决的问题，并继续深入检查工作。
