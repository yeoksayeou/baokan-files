Under his leadership, Sihetun has transformed from poor to rich: the cultivated land area has expanded from 645 mu before the land reform to 2,090 mu; the grain yield has increased nearly five times compared to before the land reform, exceeding more than three times the highest annual output during the puppet Manchukuo period.

Wang Zhentang, a representative attending this National Model Workers Conference, is one of the famous model rural cadres in Northeast China. He is currently the village chief of Sihe Village, Zhaoyuan County, Heilongjiang Province. Over the past three years, under the leadership of Wang Zhentang, Sihetun Village has transformed from poor to rich and achieved great results. The cultivated land area of the village has expanded from 645 mu before the land reform to 2,090 mu this year. Last year's grain yield was 510 shi (each shi is 500 jin), and this year it is expected to increase to 1,003 shi, an increase of nearly five times compared to the 180 shi before the land reform, exceeding more than three times the highest annual output during the puppet Manchukuo period. The number of draft animals such as cattle and horses has also increased from 30 before the land reform to 84.

Wang Zhentang was an old hired farmhand who worked for landlords for a full 32 years. Although he worked diligently, he still did not own a single house or piece of land. After the land reform, he turned over and was successively elected as the village head, director of the village farmers' association, and village chief. In 1949, he was also elected as a special model cadre in Heilongjiang Province. The mutual aid team he led was selected as a model mutual aid team. The development of agricultural production and the improvement of living standards of the farmers in Sihetun are inseparable from Wang Zhentang's exemplary leadership.

The mutual aid organization in Sihetun has gradually developed from the rice planting team in 1947 to the present, where the scope of the mutual aid team includes the entire village. All 27 laborers in the village are organized together, and manpower and animal power are assigned based on labor and exchanged based on points. This labor mutual aid organization has brought into play the enthusiasm of farmers for labor and improved technology and cultivation level, thus greatly increasing crop yields. The annual increase in the total agricultural output of the village is as follows: In 1948, 24 laborers cultivated 960 mu of land, and harvested 470 shi of grain in the autumn, an increase of 160% compared to 1947. Last year, 22 and a half laborers cultivated 1,100 mu of land (including more than 200 mu of reclaimed land) and harvested 510 shi of grain, an increase of 8.5% compared to 1948. This year, it is estimated that at least 1,003 shi can be harvested, which will exceed last year by 97%.

When Wang Zhentang started to organize labor mutual aid, he paid attention to combining agricultural and sideline production. In the autumn of 1947, there was a poor harvest, and most people did not have enough food. At this time, Wang Zhentang organized manpower to harvest and chop firewood, solving the famine problem in 1948. Other villages and towns, due to the lack of food during the busy farming season, reduced the cultivated area, but they were able to sow in time and achieved more than two harrowings and two weedings. In 1948, he also organized the harvesting of reeds and fishing. With the income from women and children's sideline occupations, the total income of the village was 80 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below), accounting for 22% of the agricultural income. In 1949, the village's sideline production income reached 400 million yuan, which could be converted into 300 shi of grain, accounting for 60% of the agricultural income. The result of organizing sideline production not only improved the living standards of the masses in the village but also actively supported agriculture, making the mutual aid team more consolidated.

Wang Zhentang's leadership is not only good at organizing, planning, and accepting scientific and technological knowledge, but also good at following the mass line. He cultivated activists such as Yu Changjiang and Zhang Shuzhen to form a strong leadership group. He conducts research on everything within the leadership group, supplements the shortcomings of his own opinions, and uses these backbone members to mobilize the masses. At the same time, Wang Zhentang also put forward the slogan "Whoever earns money, it belongs to them," extensively mobilizing women and children. In addition, he also reformed the lazy people. As a result, the entire village was involved in the production movement.

Under the leadership of Wang Zhentang, the Sihetun mutual aid team used new horse-drawn farm tools this year, greatly improving production efficiency. More than 960 mu of wasteland was reclaimed, exceeding 60% of the original plan of 600 mu. Plowing the land with a foreign plow turns the soil more evenly and finely than with a clumsy plow, thus improving the quality of cultivation. A new seeder was used for sowing more than 500 mu of land, saving a lot of labor. When harvesting wheat, a wheat harvester was used, with four horses and eight laborers harvesting 40 mu in one day. A threshing machine with six horses and ten people can thresh 50 mu in one day, saving more than half the labor compared to using a flail. Due to the use of new farm tools, the cultivation level has been greatly improved, so this year's wheat harvest is abundant, yielding more than four dou per mu. The autumn crops in the village are also growing very well, with millet as high as shoulders and soybeans reaching the chest. It is now estimated that the newly reclaimed 960 mu of wasteland alone can yield 485 shi. Therefore, the farmers in Sihetun now have great interest in using new farm tools, and they plan to use new farm tools as much as possible during the autumn harvest.

Under the leadership of Wang Zhentang and other cadres, the living standards of the masses in Sihetun have generally risen as a result of organizing production in the past few years. Sihetun used to be called Poor Zhangjiaweizi. Before the land reform, there were 28 households in the village (three landlord and rich peasant households, two middle peasant households, and 23 hired and poor peasant households). The sandy land was 64.5 qing, there were only 30 livestock, and two carts. The living conditions of the farmers were extremely poor. In 1947, more than half of the farmers did not have enough to eat. Therefore, people nearby called Sihetun a "land of mountain wolves and water thieves."

After the local land reform was completed in 1947, Wang Zhentang actively organized the farmers in the village to improve production. He is fair and impartial, so he is deeply supported by the masses. For example, in the winter of 1947, when he earned money from sideline occupations, he first bought clothes for the carters, and only asked for them himself later, which made everyone more motivated to produce. He has a very good spirit of mutual aid and friendship. When he sees that a family in the village is in difficulty, he actively thinks of ways to help. Under his organization and leadership, the living standards of the farmers in the village have been greatly improved after three or four years of production mutual aid. Most of the farmers in the village have risen to middle peasants and well-to-do middle peasants, and the three previously dirt poor households have also been upgraded to poor peasants, approaching middle peasants.

Along with the rise in economic life, culture has also improved. There was no school in the village before. In 1947, only three children of landlords went to school. In 1948, there were only seven. In 1949, a school was established in the village, and 30 children went to school. This year, the number of students has increased to 42, and no school-age children in the village have dropped out of school. Even poor children who used to herd pigs and horses have been given the opportunity to study. In addition, adults in the village also competed to learn culture. Now many of them can read newspapers and write letters. (Attached picture)

　　农村模范干部王振堂
    四合屯在他领导下，由穷变富：耕地面积由土改前的六百四十五亩，扩大到二千零九十亩；粮食产量较土改前增加近五倍，超过伪满时代最高年产量的三倍多。
    出席这次全国劳动模范会议的代表王振堂是东北著名的农村模范干部之一。他现在是黑龙江省肇源县四合村的村长。该村四合屯三年多来，在王振堂的领导下，由穷变富，获得很大的成绩。该屯耕地面积由土地改革前的六百四十五亩，扩大到今年的两千零九十亩；粮食产量去年为五百一十石（每石五百斤），今年可提高至一千零三石，较土地改革前的一百八十石增加将近五倍，并超过伪满时代最高年产量的三倍多。牛马等耕畜亦由土地改革前的三十匹增至八十四匹。
    王振堂是一个替地主当了整整三十二年长工的老雇农，虽然勤劳生产，但仍然房无一间，地无一亩。土地改革以后，他翻过身来了，并且先后当选为屯长、村农会主任、村长等职，一九四九年又被选为黑龙江省特等模范干部。他所领导的互助组被选为模范互助组。四合屯农民生产的发展与生活的改善是与王振堂的模范领导分不开的。
    四合屯的互助组织，由一九四七年的插秧组，逐渐发展，至现在，互助组的范围已经包括全屯。全屯二十七个劳动力组织在一起，人力畜力都按劳动力定分，按分换工。这种劳动互助组织，发挥了农民的劳动积极性，提高了技术与耕作水平，因而使农作物产量大大提高。该屯农产总量逐年增长情形如下：一九四八年二十四个劳动力，种地九百六十亩，秋天打粮四七○石，比一九四七年增加了百分之一六○。去年二十二个半劳动力，种地一千一百亩（开荒二百多亩），打粮五一○石，比一九四八年增加百分之八点五。今年估计最低可打一千零三石，将超过去年百分之九十七。
    王振堂在一开始组织劳动互助时，就注意使农业与副业生产结合起来。一九四七年秋天歉收，大多数人粮食不足。这时王振堂组织了人力，一面收秋，一面打柴，解决了一九四八年的灾荒困难。别的村屯因农忙时口粮缺乏，缩小了耕地面积，他们却能及时下种，并且作到了二铲二趟以上。一九四八年他又组织打苇子，打鱼，加上妇女儿童副业的收入，全屯共计收入八千万元（东北币，下同），占农业收入的百分之二十二。一九四九年全年该屯副业生产收入更达到四亿元，可折粮三百石，占农业收入的百分之六十。组织起来进行副业生产的结果，不但改善了该屯群众生活，而且积极地支援了农业，使得互助组更加巩固起来。
    王振堂的领导，不仅是善于组织，善于计划，善于接受科学技术，而且善于走群众路线。他培养了于长江、张淑贞等积极分子，组成了一个坚强的领导集团。他凡事都在领导集团内进行研究，补充自己意见的不足，并经过这些骨干分子去发动群众。同时，王振堂还提出“谁挣钱归谁”的口号广泛地发动了妇女和儿童；此外还改造了懒汉。因而，全屯都卷入了生产运动。
    四合屯互助组在王振堂领导下今年使用了马拉式的新农具，大大地提高了生产效率，计开荒九百六十亩以上，超过原计划六百亩的百分之六十。洋犁开地比笨犁开荒翻的土既匀且细，因而提高了耕作质量。播种时又使用了新式播种机，种地五百多亩，节省了很多劳动力。在收麦时使用了割小麦机，四匹马，八个劳力一天就割四十亩。打场机用六匹马，十个人，一天能打五十亩，比用?子省工一半多。由于新式农具的使用，大大提高了耕作水平，因而今年小麦丰收，每亩打到四斗多。该屯秋禾生长得也很好，谷子披肩高，大豆齐胸，现在仅新开的九百六十亩荒地，估计就能打四百八十五石。因此，四合屯的农民现在对使用新式农具已有很大兴趣，他们准备在秋收时，尽量使用新式农具。
    在王振堂及其他干部领导下，四合屯的群众几年来组织起来进行生产的结果，生活已普遍上升。四合屯从前叫穷张家围子，土地改革前全屯二十八户（地富三户，中农二户，雇贫农二十三户），沙岗子地六十四垧五亩，只有三十个牲畜，两台车，农民生活极端贫困。一九四七年半数以上农民没吃的。因此，附近的人把四合屯叫做“山狼水贼”之地。
    一九四七年当地土地改革完成后，王振堂就积极地组织全屯农民群众搞好生产。他为人公正，所以深得群众拥护。如一九四七年冬天搞副业挣了钱，他就先给赶车的买上了衣服，自己却在以后才要，这样就使得大家生产更有劲了。他的互助友爱精神非常好，看见屯里那家困难，就主动地想办法帮助。全屯农民在他的组织和领导下，经过三、四年的生产互助，现在生活已经大大改善。全屯大部农民已上升为中农和富裕中农，三户过去一无所有的赤贫户，亦升为贫农，接近中农。
    随同经济生活上升，文化也提高了。从前屯里没有学校，一九四七年只有三个地主小孩上学。一九四八年才有七个。一九四九年屯里建立了学校，就有三十个小孩上学。今年上学的更增加到四十二个，全屯学龄儿童已无一失学者，连过去放猪放马的穷孩子都得到了学习机会。此外该屯成年人也相竞学习文化，现在他们中好多人都能看报写信了。（附图片）
