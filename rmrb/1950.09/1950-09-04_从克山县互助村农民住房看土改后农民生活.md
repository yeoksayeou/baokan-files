　　Viewing the Lives of Peasants After Land Reform Through the Farmers' Housing in Huzhu Village, Keshan County
    Liu Xiaoguang
    Huzhu Village is an ordinary village in Beixing District, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province. The production and living conditions of the farmers living in this village are representative of general villages. The entire Huzhu Village is composed of nine villages. After the land reform movement of 1947, and after three years of the Great Production Movement, the entire village has taken on a completely new look. The most significant sign is the new houses nestled amidst the green trees.
    Before the land reform, the entire village of 270 households had a total of 290 rooms. After the land reform, in 1948 and 1949, a total of 60 new rooms were added. From the beginning of spring this year to now, another 98 rooms have been built.
    In the past, most of the houses in the village belonged to the four big landlords and five rich peasants. Apart from the 35 middle-peasant households and a few poor peasant households having 70 rooms, the 220 poor peasant and farmhand households all rented houses. They could only rent a section of a heated brick bed if they worked for the landlord; if they didn't work for the landlord, it would be too difficult to rent a room! Old farmhand Qian Baifu, because he didn't have the labor to work for the landlord, squeezed with Gao Qianhe and three other poor farmhand families, 23 people in all, into five dilapidated rooms. The Qian family of six lived on the small heated brick bed in the innermost room, with a stove built under the bed for cooking. One day, because the adults weren't watching, his two-year-old child crawled into a pot of boiling water and was scalded to death. Old Qian said painfully through gritted teeth: "No matter what, one day we'll have a house with an inner and outer room!" Old farmhand Sun Wanyou couldn't rent a house, so he borrowed space next to the landlord's warehouse to build a room, and five people slept on one heated brick bed, having to bend over to enter the house. Old Sun's wife recalled: "At that time, even carrying water couldn't get through the door, my husband had to put it outside the door, and I had to carry it in bucket by bucket. Looking longingly at the landlord's glass windows, I thought: When will I be able to live in a bright house!"
    When winter came, the biting northeast wind howled, and the poor people, lacking clothes and firewood, couldn't bear the cold, so they smeared the windows tightly, making the room dark and gloomy, without a ray of light. When the wind blew hard, the women were often choked by the smoke when cooking. Grandma Du from the central village said: "I was dizzy and lightheaded all winter long. My youngest son was choked by the smoke and had to be thrown in the snow to slowly wake up." Some, afraid of the smoke, didn't dare to light a fire and slept on a cold bed all day long. Most of the women were in poor health and often suffered from back pain and leg pain. In Xingfa village, 22 out of 27 women had backaches and leg pains. People all hoped for the day when they could live in a satisfactory house.
    The day they were waiting for finally arrived! Their wish came true! The landlords were overthrown in the village, the land was distributed, and the houses changed too. Village head Sun Wanfa said: "There's really been a big change in the past three years! When you enter the village, you can see that the villagers' houses are all neat and tidy."
    Indeed, since the land reform, the dilapidated houses in Huzhu Village have been decreasing day by day. Take Xingye Village as an example: before the land reform, the entire village of 16 households had only 16 rooms, but now 18 households have 34 rooms. Before the land reform, in Huzhu Village, more than 180 out of 220 poor peasant and farmhand households lived in opposite-facing heated brick beds (that is, two families shared one room). Now, out of 325 households (including those who have moved in and immigrants), only 50 households live in opposite-facing heated brick beds. Many households already have a small yard.
    Life now is much better than before the land reform! Qian Baifu, who used to have six people living on one section of a north-facing heated brick bed, built two rooms after the land was distributed, with three windows facing outwards. His wife said: "This time we have our own yard, and the four little ones can run around and play!" Now Old Qian is raising four horses, big and small, and behind the house, large sunflowers, cucumbers, and green beans are growing lushly. Looking at the six large stacks of golden wheat he had just pulled back from the field in front of the door, he said happily: "In the past few years, I've felt relaxed, life has been energetic, and my body has become stronger!"
    The new houses in Huzhu Village are increasing day by day. The district will be building brick kilns next year. When the villagers heard this news, they are all waiting to build brick houses.
    On the evening of August 12th, village head Sun Wanfa came back from the people's school, reciting the words he had just learned: "Wheat harvest, fire prevention," and said to me: "The desks in this school were all newly made this year; in another two years, these five earthen houses will also be turned into new brick ones!"

　　从克山县互助村农民住房看土改后农民生活
    刘晓光
    互助村是黑龙江省克山县北兴区的一个普通村子。住在这个村子里的农民生产和生活的情况，代表着一般的村庄。全互助村由九个屯组成。它经过了一九四七年的土地改革运动，又经过三年来的大生产运动，现在全村已焕然一新，最显著的标志是夹在绿树丛中的一座座的新房舍。
    在土地改革以前，全村二百七十户共有二百九十间房子。土地改革以后，一九四八和一九四九两年，共增加新房六十间。今年从开春到现在，又已盖起了九十八间。
    过去，全村房子大部分是四家大地主和五家富农的。除了三十五户中农和几家贫农有七十间房子外，二百二十户贫雇农都是租房住。只有给地主做活才能租到一铺炕；若不给地主做活，想租间房，那可太难了！老雇农钱白福因为没有劳动力，不能给地主做活，就和高前和等四家贫雇农，二十三口人，挤在五间破房子里。老钱一家六口人，住在紧里屋的小炕上，炕下边垒个灶做饭。一天，因为大人没看到，他的二岁大的一个孩子爬到开水锅里烫死了。钱老头痛心地咬着牙说：“多喒有那样一天，非盖所里外屋的房子不可！”老雇农孙万有租不着房子，借地主仓房旁边搭了个房，五口人睡在一个炕上，进屋都得弯着腰。老孙的老婆回忆说：“那时候挑水都进不来门，男人放到门外，还得我一桶一桶提进屋里。眼巴巴地看着地主的玻璃窗，我心想：啥时候能住个透点亮的房！”
    冬天来了，刺骨的东北风呼呼地刮，穷人缺衣少柴，耐不住寒，就把窗户抹得严严的，屋里黑洞洞，不见一点亮。大风一刮，妇女们做饭往往就被烟呛过去了。中心屯杜老太太说：“一冬都是头迷眼昏的，我小儿子叫烟熏过去，扔在雪地里才慢慢醒过来。”有的怕烟，不敢烧火，就整天睡凉炕。多数妇女身体不好，常得腰痛腿痛病。兴发屯二十七个妇女，腰酸腿疼的就有二十二个。人们都盼着什么时候能住个称心的屋子。
    盼望的日子终于来到了！心愿实现了！村里打倒了地主，分到了土地，房子也随着变了样。村长孙万发说：“三年多来真是大变样啊！进村一看，老乡的房子都是整整齐齐的。”
    真的，从土地改革以后，互助村的破房子一天天减少了。拿一个兴业屯来说，土地改革前全屯十六户只有十六间房子，现在十八户就有三十四间房子。互助村在土地改革前，二百二十户贫雇农中，有一百八十多户是住着对面炕的（即两家共住一个屋）。现在三百二十五户（其中有迁来的户和移民），只有五十户住对面炕了。好多户都已经有一个小院子了。
    现在的生活比土改前美多啦！原先六口人住一铺北炕的钱白福，分完土地就盖起两间房，开着三扇窗户。他老婆说：“这回自家一个院，四个小的也能跑着玩啦！”现在钱老汉喂着大小四匹马，房后种着大向日葵、黄瓜、豆角长得鲜嫩。他望着门前刚从地里拉回的六大垛金黄小麦，高兴地说：“这几年心里舒展，日子过的有劲，身子也壮实啦！”
    全互助村的新房是天天在增多着。区上明年要烧砖窑，老乡知道了这个信，都等着要盖砖房。
    八月十二日晚上，村长孙万发从民校回来，一边念着刚学的字：“麦收，防火”，一边对我说：“这学校桌子都是今年新作的；再过两年，这五间土房也要叫它变成新砖的！”
