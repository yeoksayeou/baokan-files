Editor's Note: This article was published in the Korean "Labor News" on August 28th of this year. The author, Xu Yingshan, is the Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Central Headquarters of the Workers' Party of North Korea. What he introduces in this article is only the situation of the Workers' Party of North Korea. The Workers' Party of North Korea was formed by the merger of the Communist Party of North Korea and the New People's Party of Korea, which was announced in Pyongyang on August 28, 1946. This year, August 28th, is the fourth anniversary of its founding.

　　The Workers' Party of North Korea has been established for a full four years. We are welcoming the fourth anniversary of the Party's founding while opposing the armed invasion of our motherland by the American imperialist aggressors and their loyal lackeys, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) bandit gang, and carrying out a just liberation war for the unification, independence, freedom, and honor of the entire nation. During this critical period, all organizations and members of our Party are implementing the decision of the Party Central Committee: "To reorganize all our work into a wartime system, actively assist the front lines, and mobilize to destroy the enemy. In our work, especially during wartime, no harmful complacency or relaxation is allowed; we must always be prepared to complete the tasks given by the Party and the government."

　　Mobilizing all forces, both at the front and in the rear, to fight bravely and without fear of sacrifice for the rapid end of the war.

　　The heroic People's Army, which has launched a righteous offensive to safeguard the independence and honor of the motherland and to oppose the armed invasion by the Li Chengwan bandit gang and American imperialism, is effectively annihilating and sweeping away the enemy, liberating 92 percent of the total area and 92 percent of the total population of the southern half of the country.

　　Thanks to the organized activities of the Party's organizations and the noble vanguard role of Party members, all the people in the rear, with extreme hatred for the enemy and a strong belief in victory, are actively supporting the front lines with high patriotic will and united strength, striving to consolidate the rear.

　　The many brilliant achievements our people have gained in the Fatherland Liberation War are inseparable from the great democratic reform projects implemented in the northern half of the Republic after the Soviet army liberated our motherland, and from the great achievements the Party has made in the Fatherland Liberation War. In the year from the third to the fourth anniversary of its founding, the Party has continuously grown and consolidated in the struggle to consolidate the achievements of the democratic reforms, in the struggle against the colonial enslavement policy of American imperialism and the traitorous crimes of the Li Chengwan bandit gang, and in the organized and relentless struggle within the Party to eliminate non-Party tendencies.

　　In building a prosperous and strong democratic motherland, the Party has absorbed and united advanced workers, peasants, and working intellectuals into the Party, developed the Party's quality and quantity, and strengthened and improved the Party's leadership work and leadership strength. Continued and unremitting Marxist-Leninist political and ideological education and organized training combined with practical work for Party members have cultivated countless Party talents and greatly improved the scientific and ideological level of Party members.

　　In particular, the Party Central Committee's December Plenary Session and its decisions were of great significance for the organizational consolidation and development of the Party in the past year.

　　After the December Plenary Session, through the struggle to implement its decisions, the Party's vigilance and political and ideological level were further improved. The Party's leadership strength and political influence in the industrial and economic sectors have also been significantly strengthened. In just four years, the Party has developed into an organizationally and politically strong party that is related to the fate of the motherland and the future of the people, that can mobilize the entire people at any time, and that can win victory in any struggle.

　　Such a party is capable today of destroying the American imperialist aggressors and the Li Chengwan bandit gang, and has become the guiding force for all the Korean people in safeguarding the independence and honor of the motherland.

　　The Party has successfully carried out land reform and several people's economic plans, rapidly developed an independent people's economy and culture, and established the People's Republic. To consolidate this republic, it has built and strengthened a powerful People's Army, a constabulary, and a security force to protect the motherland and the people from the infringement of American imperialists and their running dogs, and has waged an incomparably heroic struggle against the enemy for the eternal independence and honor of the motherland. In all of these tasks, the Party has always played a vanguard role.

　　The Party's power and vanguard role are particularly evident in the Fatherland Liberation War; they are even more clearly demonstrated in the fierce battles to completely destroy and sweep away the American aggressors and the Li Chengwan bandit gang, in the struggle to increase transportation and increase production under the barbaric bombing of enemy planes, and in various construction undertakings in the rear. Because in the above-mentioned battles and undertakings, the vast majority of the heroes who displayed fearless bravery, established great achievements, and won military merits and other merits are members of our Party.

　　The Party has further united the domestic democratic forces, explained the domestic and international situation and the prospects of our struggle to the people, relentlessly exposed the anti-people nature of the reactionaries, greatly enhanced the people's political enthusiasm and vigilance, strengthened the activities of democratic social organizations, strengthened the united front work with patriotic friendly parties, and effectively mobilized the organized forces of the entire people, led by the broad working people, to fight for the unification of the motherland and democratic construction.

　　The Party always carries out its activities as a loyal defender of the demands and interests of the working people. Therefore, the respect and trust of the entire people, led by the working class, for the Party has increased immeasurably. They express their respect and support for the Party and the government by enthusiastically participating in the work of implementing the Party and government's various measures. Especially during the Liberation War, the number of non-Party activists who have been tested on the front lines or in the rear and who have applied to join the Party has greatly increased.

　　The Party has accomplished a great deal in the struggle for the unification and independence of the motherland. The Party has further enhanced its prestige among the people and has united the broad masses of the people around the Party.

　　During this period, the Workers' Party of North Korea, which was constantly growing and strengthening in the process of democratic reforms in the northern half of the country, and the Workers' Party of South Korea, which preserved the Party's backbone and core in the arduous environment of unprecedented massacres and suppression by the U.S. imperialists and the Li Chengwan bandit gang, and continued the bloody struggle in guerrilla warfare, underground work, and prisons, merged into the Workers' Party of Korea and moved forward.

　　In just four years since the Party's founding, there have been tremendous achievements in the Party's development and in the construction of the motherland. This is due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, the Party absorbing outstanding and strong elements who have been tested in the struggle into the Party among the working people, organizing and strengthening the Party ranks, promptly eliminating alien elements who have infiltrated the Party, relentlessly criticizing all left-leaning or right-leaning elements, highly promoting inner-Party democracy, and ensuring the Party's ideological unity and solid organization.

　　At the same time, it is also due to the organized mobilization of Party organizations to arm all Party members with the theory of Marxism-Leninism to ensure the completion of all undertakings, and to strengthen their training in organization and discipline.

　　Today, with the deep trust and enthusiastic support of the entire people, led by the working class, the Party is further consolidating and developing itself as the most powerful leading force in our motherland, and is mobilizing the entire Party in the glorious struggle to win the final victory in the people's liberation war that determines the fate of the motherland.

　　Due to the core role played by Party organizations and Party members, the results we have achieved, whether on the front lines or in the rear, are brilliant and lofty. But the stubborn enemy is cunning and sinister, and is attempting to salvage the situation with a last-ditch struggle. The Party must effectively pass this national test, destroy and sweep away the American imperialist aggressor troops and their running dogs, the Li Chengwan remnant bandit gang, as soon as possible, and rapidly win complete victory in the war. In order to accomplish this great historically significant undertaking, all Party organizations and Party members must resolutely implement the tasks that the Party Central Committee has decided that Party organizations and Party members should undertake in the Liberation War, and the two calls that Comrade Kim Il-sung has issued to all the people regarding this war.

　　In order to further strengthen the Party's combat power, further strengthen wartime work, and dedicate even more efforts to the victory of the struggle, Party organizations must, with a high degree of vigilance, wage a relentless struggle against alien elements, speculators, wavering elements, and non-combat factors that occur during the war who have infiltrated the Party, and further strengthen the Party's organizational and ideological unity and purity. Continuously absorb into the Party those non-Party activists, workers, peasants, and working intellectuals who have displayed bravery and creativity in the course of combat and in all wartime undertakings under enemy bombing, and who have demonstrated a patriotic and dedicated will before the Party and the motherland, further expand the Party, and strengthen the Party's quality.

　　In order to raise the Party's cause to a high political level that is adapted to wartime, and to greatly enhance the Party's organizational activities and core leadership role, all Party members must be further armed with the theory of Marxism-Leninism. In order to enable them to fight bravely for victory under any difficulty, we must strengthen ideological and organizational training. At the same time, we must increase the people's anger and hatred towards the enemy, further strengthen their confidence in victory, and make them more firmly united around the Party, the Republic government, and Comrade Kim Il-sung. Everyone must fight bravely to the end for the final victory. We must cultivate in them a high degree of patriotism and strengthen wartime political work among the masses.

　　In this way, Party organizations and Party members must strengthen the wartime system in their respective work positions. In particular, under the barbaric bombing of the American imperialists, we should strengthen all possible defense countermeasures. In production enterprises and transportation units, we must over-fulfill the production of military supplies and the production stipulated in the basic plan. We must launch a broad patriotic struggle among the working masses to rapidly repair factories and enterprises that have been bombed and damaged by the enemy, and to transport more military supplies and ammunition to the front lines in a satisfactory manner.

　　In rural areas, we must mobilize all the peasants to supply more grain and non-staple foods to the front lines and the rear. We must more widely launch the movement of patriotic young men and women volunteers to join the People's Army and the Volunteer Army, led by Party members, and launch a movement to collect and donate funds for tanks and airplanes to strengthen the People's Army and its equipment. We must also actively mobilize the patriotic enthusiasm of the entire people to assist the families of the People's Army and war service personnel, and actively carry out the work of comforting the wounded and sick soldiers.

　　Party organizations must strengthen the work of the government organs, correctly and quickly materialize the various measures of the Party and the government among the masses, and enable the entire people to fight for the final victory in the Liberation War. All the people, whether in organs or factories, in cities or villages, must wage a struggle against some of the reactionary elements and rumor-mongers who weaken the people's unity and fighting strength in the rear, so that they cannot get the possibility of activities.

　　In the Party organizations in the liberated areas of the southern half, we must actively carry out the work of restoring Party organizations and registering Party members, based on the core Party members who are guerrillas and underground workers, as well as those who have been rescued from prisons, restore the people's committees and the elections of county, district, and village people's committees, carry out land reform work, reorganize social organizations, and carry out various democratic construction undertakings. And we must step up the elimination of the vicious anti-people remnants left over from the heinous rule of the U.S. imperialists and Li Chengwan.

　　A great national mission is placed before the entire people in order to win victory in the just war. Our Party bears the sacred task of effectively defending all these great national undertakings before the entire people.

　　All Party organizations and Party members, under a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and a tense situation, respond to Comrade Kim Il-sung's call: "We will assist our People's Army and the front lines with all our strength!" "All the strength of our people is mobilized to destroy and sweep away the enemy!" and unite with the entire people, subordinate everything to the purpose of war and the victory of the front lines, and bravely stand at the forefront of the people with organized strength.

　　Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee centered on Comrade Kim Il-sung, our strong Party, with all Party members and the entire nation solidly united around it and armed with the advanced science of Marxism-Leninism, is able to overcome the crisis facing the motherland, effectively organize and mobilize the masses, and advance towards victory.

　　With the support and solidarity of the peace-loving people of the world, headed by the Soviet Union, glorious victory surely belongs to the Korean people, who are united and advancing under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea.

　　迎接北朝鲜劳动党创立四周年
    徐应善
    编者按：这篇文章发表于本年八月二十八日朝鲜《劳动新闻》。作者徐应善是朝鲜劳动党中央本部组织部副部长。他在这篇文章中所介绍的还只是北朝鲜劳动党的情况。北朝鲜劳动党是由北朝鲜共产党和朝鲜新民党两个组织，于一九四六年八月二十八日在平壤宣布合并成立的。今年八月二十八日是它成立的四周年纪念日。
    北朝鲜劳动党创立已经整四年。我们在反对侵略我们祖国的美帝国主义武装侵犯者及其忠实走狗李承晚匪帮，进行为祖国统一、独立、自由和荣誉的全民的正义解放战争中，迎接党的创立四周年纪念。在这严重的时期，我们党的一切组织和党员们，执行着党中央委员会的决定，即：“将自己的一切工作改编成战时体制，积极援助前线，为击灭敌人而动员起来。在自己的工作当中，尤其在战时，不许存在有害的安逸性和松弛性，经常准备能够完成党和政府给予的任务。”
    动员一切力量，在前线和后方，为迅速结束战争而勇敢地不怕牺牲地进行着斗争。
    为了维护祖国的独立和荣誉、反对李承晚匪帮和美帝国主义的武装侵犯，已开始正义进攻的英勇的人民军，有效地歼灭、扫荡着敌人，解放了南半部全部地区的百分之九十二，全部人口的百分之九十二。
    由于党的组织的有组织的活动与党员们的高尚的先锋作用，全体后方人民在对敌人的极端忿恨和坚强的胜利信心下，以高昂的爱国意志与团结的力量，积极地支援前线，努力巩固后方。
    我们人民在祖国解放战争中争得的许多光辉成果，是和伟大的苏联军武力使我们祖国得到解放后在共和国北半部实行的伟大的各项民主改革事业，以及祖国解放战争中党所争取的巨大成绩分不开的。党在其创立三周年至四周年的一年间，在巩固民主改革成果的斗争、反对美帝国主义殖民地奴役政策和李承晚匪帮卖国罪行的斗争中，以及在党内消灭非党倾向、展开有组织的无情斗争中，不断地成长和巩固了。
    党在建设富强的民主祖国中，把先进的工人、农民、劳动的知识分子，吸收到党内并团结他们，发展了党的质与量，加强提高了党的领导工作和领导力量。对党员继续不断地以马列主义政治思想教育及加强结合实际工作的有组织的训练，培养了无数党的人材，大大提高了党员的科学思想水平。
    尤其是过去一年中，对于党的组织上的巩固与发展具有重大意义的，是党中央委员会十二月定期会议和它的决定。
    十二月定期会议后，经过为执行其决定而进行的斗争，进一步提高了党内的警惕性与政治思想水平。在产业经济部门中，党的领导力量和政治影响也显著地加强了。仅仅四年中，党发展成为关系到祖国的命运和人民的未来的，不论何时都能动员全体人民、不论任何斗争中都能争取胜利的，组织上与政治上强有力的党了。
    这样的党在今天能击灭美帝国主义侵略者与李承晚匪帮，成为维护祖国独立和荣誉的、全朝鲜人民的指导力量了。
    党胜利地进行了土地改革和数次的人民经济计划，迅速发展自主的人民经济与文化，建立了人民共和国。为了巩固这个共和国，建设与加强了强大的人民军、警备队和保安队，以维护祖国与人民免遭美帝国主义者及其走狗的侵害，为祖国的永远独立和荣誉向敌人进行英勇无比的斗争。在以上这些任务上，党不论何时都起了先锋作用。
    党的威力和先锋作用，在祖国解放战争中，特别明显地表现着；在彻底击灭与扫荡美国侵略者和李承晚匪帮的残酷战斗中，在敌机的野兽般的轰炸下进行增加运输增加生产的斗争中，以及后方各项建设事业中，更明显地证明着。因为在上述战斗和事业中，发挥不怕牺牲的勇敢性、建立了伟大功勋的英雄、获得军功者和其他有功者中，绝大多数是我党党员。
    党更加团结了国内民主力量，向人民大众解释了国内外形势和我们的斗争前途，无情地揭露了反动派的反人民本质，高度地提高了人民政治热情和警觉性，并且加强了民主主义各社会团体的活动，加强了与爱国的各友党的统一战线工作，将以广大劳动人民为首的全体人民有组织的力量有效地动员起来，为祖国统一和民主建设而斗争。
    党不论什么时候，都以劳动人民大众的要求和人民利益的忠实拥护者来展开活动。因此，以劳动阶级为首的全体人民对党的尊敬和信赖无比地增加了。他们以热烈参加实现党和政府的各项措施的工作，表示对党与政府的尊敬和拥护。特别是在解放战争过程中，在前线或在后方，受过考验的非党员积极分子，申请入党的大大增加了。
    在为祖国统一、独立而进行的斗争中，党完成的事业是巨大的。党在人民群众中，更加提高了它的威信，在党的周围团结了广大的人民群众。
    在这时期内，在北半部民主改革过程中不断成长和加强的北朝鲜劳动党，和在美帝和李承晚匪帮进行空前大屠杀和弹压的艰苦环境下保存党的骨干和核心，在游击队、地下工作和监狱中继续进行流血斗争的南朝鲜劳动党，合并成为朝鲜劳动党，而向前发展了。
    党创立以来，仅在四年间，党内的发展和祖国建设上都有巨大的成果。这是由于在以金日成同志为首的党中央委员会正确领导下，党在劳动人民中，将斗争中经过考验的优秀坚强分子，吸收到党内，有组织地加强了党的队伍，及时肃清了混入党内的异己分子，无情地批评了一切左倾或右倾分子，高度地发扬了党内民主，保障了党的思想统一和坚固的组织性的缘故。
    同时，也是有组织地发动党的组织，以马克思、列宁主义的理论来武装全体党员，以保障完成一切事业，在组织与纪律上加强训练了他们的缘故。
    今天党在劳动阶级为首的全体人民的深厚信任和热烈支持下，作为我们祖国最有威力的领导力量，更加巩固和发展着自己，在争取决定祖国命运的人民解放战争的最后胜利的光荣斗争上动员着全党。
    由于党的组织和党员们起的核心作用，不论前线和后方，我们争取的成果是辉煌而崇高的。但是顽强的敌人是狡猾阴凶的，敌人企图以最后挣扎挽救残局。党必须有效地经过这种民族考验，早日击灭扫荡美帝侵略军及其走狗李承晚残余匪帮，迅速争取战争的完全胜利。为完成这种有历史意义的伟大事业，全体党组织和党员们，必须坚决执行党中央委员会所决定的党组织和党员在解放战争中应担当的任务和金日成同志关于这次战争向全体人民发出的两次号召。
    为了更加强党的战斗力量，更加强战时工作，为斗争的胜利而更加献身努力，党的组织必须在高度的警觉性下，与混入党内的异己分子、投机分子、动摇分子以及在战争过程中发生的非战斗性因素，作无情的斗争，进一步加强党内组织上思想上的一致性和纯洁性。将那些在战斗过程中和敌机轰炸下的一切战时事业中发挥勇敢性和创造性，而在党和祖国面前表现出爱国献身的意志的非党积极分子、工人、农民、劳动知识分子，不断地吸收到党内来，更加扩大党，并加强党的质量。
    为了将党的事业向适应于战时的高度政治水平上提高，并高度提高党的组织活动和核心领导作用，对全体党员要以马克思、列宁主义理论更加武装起来。为了使他们在任何困难下为胜利勇敢战斗，要加强思想组织上训练。同时要提高人民大众对敌人的愤怒和敌忾心，更加坚固胜利信心，使他们更巩固的团结在党、共和国政府以及金日成同志的周围。每一个人都要为最后胜利而始终勇敢地战斗。要培养他们高度的爱国主义思想，在群众中加强战时政治工作。
    这样，必须使党组织和党员们在自己的工作岗位上加强战时体制。特别是在美帝野兽般的轰炸下，应加强一切可能的防卫对策。在生产企业中和运输单位中，必须将军需品生产和基本计划上规定的生产超额完成。必须为迅速修复被敌人轰炸遭受破坏的工场、企业，并为将军需品和弹药更多地圆满地输送到前线，而在工人群众中展开广泛的爱国主义的斗争。
    在农村，必须将全体农民们总动员起来，向前线和后方供给更多的粮食和副食物。必须更广泛地展开以党员为首的男女爱国青年志愿参加人民军和义勇军运动，并开展征集献纳坦克、飞机基金的运动，加强人民军和其装备。还要积极动员全体人民的爱国热情，援助人民军队和战勤人员们的家属，积极展开慰问伤病员工作。
    党组织必须加强政权机关工作，将党和政府的各项措施正确地迅速地在群众中具体化，使全体人民在解放战争中为最后胜利而斗争。全体人民不论在机关或工场，城市或乡村，必须与削弱后方人民团结和斗争力量的一部分反动分子和造谣分子展开斗争，使他们不能得到活动的可能。
    在南半部解放地区的党组织，必须积极展开以游击队员和地下工作人员以及从监狱中救出的做为骨干的核心党员为基础，进行恢复党组织的工作和党员登记工作，恢复人民委员会和县、区、村人民委员会选举及土地改革工作，重新组织社会团体，进行各项民主建设事业。并必须加紧肃清美帝和李承晚的罪恶统治所遗留的狠毒的反人民的残余势力。
    为争取正义战争的胜利，全体人民面前摆着巨大民族使命。我党在全体人民面前负着有效地保卫这一切伟大的民族事业的神圣任务。
    全体党组织和党员们，在高度革命警觉性和紧张的局面下，响应金日成同志的号召，即：“我们以全部力量援助我们的人民军和前线！”“我们人民的全部力量，为击灭扫荡敌人而动员！”和全体人民团结在一起，一切服从战争目的和前线胜利，以有组织的力量，勇敢地站在人民的最前面。
    在以金日成同志为中心的党中央委员会的正确领导下的，全体党员和全国人民巩固地团结在其周围的，以马克思、列宁主义的先进科学武装起来的强大的我党，能够克服祖国面临着的危机将人民大众有效地组织并动员起来，向着胜利前进。
    在以苏联为首的全世界爱好和平人民的支持和声援下，光辉的胜利一定属于以朝鲜劳动党为首的团结前进着的朝鲜人民。
