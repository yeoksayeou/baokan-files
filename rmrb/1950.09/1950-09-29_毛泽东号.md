　　Mao Zedong Locomotive
    (Serialized Medium-Length Story)
    By Ding Kexin and Qing Ying; Illustration by Zhuang Yan
        Thirty-Nine, "We must learn from the 'Mao Zedong' Locomotive!"
    On March 27th, the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive arrived at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot.
    The head of the locomotive depot came from the Northeast and had long been promoting how good and amazing the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive was.
    When he finally saw it, ah! It was indeed beautiful!
    A red five-pointed star was hung high on the front top of the locomotive, surrounded by golden wheat ears, with portraits of Chairman Mao on both sides, and the four characters "Mao Zedong Locomotive" were written, each character shining with gold!
    The entire locomotive was indescribably clean, so clean that it gleamed black and bright!
    Looking back at their own locomotives, there was no need to mention them, each one was dirty and dilapidated, and they immediately blushed with shame!
    But look, they still thought it wasn't clean or beautiful enough, and they started wiping the locomotive as soon as they got off.
    And the work had already been divided: some wiped the upper part, some wiped the lower part, those wiping the upper part climbed very high, and those wiping the lower part crawled under the locomotive.
    Except for the old hero, they were all young lads.
    "Ah, did you see that? They are not afraid of getting dirty or tired!"
    "They can't bear to throw away even a little bit of oily cotton waste!"
    "They can not only disassemble, but also install!"
    Not satisfied with just looking at the outside, some people even went onto the locomotive and into the driver's cab to take a look.
    "It's really good, truly extraordinary!"
    "No wonder they are model workers, they are really amazing!"
    Many people went back and secretly worked harder, learning to wipe their own locomotives.
    A welcoming meeting for all the depot's crew members was held, and the depot head gave a detailed introduction to the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive. But Li Yong and Guo Shude both said:
    "We mainly came to learn from the inland..."
    People below whispered to each other:
    "Look how polite they are!"
    "So modest!"
    Some people went up to the stage:
    "We must learn from the 'Mao Zedong' Locomotive!"
    One came down and another went up:
    "Follow the old大哥, learn from the old大哥!"
    After the meeting, there were also a few who were not impressed, saying:
    "Don't listen to them talking so well, they haven't even run the locomotive yet!"
    "That's right, no matter how good it is, it can't leave the railway and fly into the sky!"
    Li Yong and Guo Shude immediately held group meetings to determine the running plan, deciding to run to Tianjin first.
    Some people came to watch out of a desire to learn, and others were concerned, so they all gathered to watch the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive start: let's see how you run the locomotive!
    It was indeed different: one shift drove the locomotive, and three shifts of people came to check and add oil... everyone was responsible.
    As the locomotive was about to start, a loud call came from the driver's cab:
    "Is the departure signal good?"
    Another responded:
    "The departure signal is good!"
    The people watching all laughed:
    "Ha, in all my life, it's the first time I've seen this."
    "How embarrassing, how can they shout so loudly."
    "Hey, this is real responsibility, shouting to remind people will reduce accidents."
    Locomotive No. 1939 was the most enthusiastic, and they asked the old hero what that was all about? Was it just called "call and response"?
    The old hero gave a long explanation:
    "This is called call and response, to check if the signals and switches are correct. Shouting draws attention, boosts everyone's spirits, and prevents accidents. For example, if there is something ahead, you shout: Attention ahead! When the locomotive leaves the station, you check if there is anything wrong in the rear and shout: All good in the rear!..."
    More and more people gathered to listen, and Zheng Dugong took the opportunity to tell everyone about the three-shovel system. Finally, he pointed to the locomotive that was moving forward, as if he could still see the stoker adding coal, and said:
    "This three-shovel firing method! It just requires the stoker to be a little more diligent; but it's not hard, it saves coal and effort, the fire is even and strong, and the locomotive runs well!"... (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号
    （中篇连载）

        三十九、“一定要向毛泽东号好好学习！”
    三月二十七日，“毛泽东号”到达丰台机务段。
    机务段长是东北来的，早就宣传“毛泽东号”如何好如何棒。
    等到一见，啊呀！果然漂亮！
    车前顶上高挂着一个红五星，围着金黄色的麦穗，两旁是毛主席的像，并且都写着“毛泽东号”四个大字，每个字都闪着金光！
    全车说不清有多么干净，干净得乌光雪亮！
    回头再看看自己的机车，甭提啦，一台台又脏又烂，立时就红了脸！
    可是，你看，人家还嫌不干净不漂亮呢，一下车就动手擦起车来了。
    而且早就分好工的：有的擦上部，有的擦下部，擦上部的爬得老高，擦下部的钻到了车底下。
    除了老英雄，一个个都是年青青的小伙子。
    “啊呀，看见没有？不怕脏，也不怕累！”
    “剩下一点点油棉丝也舍不得扔掉！”
    “能拆卸不算，还能安装呢！”
    外面看不满足，有的人还上到车上，还走进司机棚里面去看。
    “就是好，实在不简单哩！”
    “怪不得人家是模范，真是了不起！”
    好多人回去就暗暗加劲，学习擦起自己的机车来。
    召开了全段乘务员的欢迎大会，段长把“毛泽东号”做了详细的介绍。可是李永和郭树德都说：
    “我们主要是向关内来学习……”
    台下互相轻声告诉：
    “看看人家多客气！”
    “真虚心！”
    有的人就走上主席台：
    “咱们一定要向毛泽东号好好学习！”
    一个下来一个又上去：
    “跟着老大哥走，向老大哥看齐！”
    散会以后，也有个别不佩服的，说：
    “不要听他说的那么好，还没有见跑车哩！”
    “对啦，怎么好也不能离开铁路跑到天上去！”
    李永、郭树德他们立即开小组会，定跑车计划，决定先跑天津。
    人们有的为了学习，有的用上了心，“毛泽东号”发车也围上来看：看看你们跑车到底怎样跑？
    果然也不同：一班开车，三班人都来检查，给油，……大家负责。
    车快开，司机棚里高声呼唤起来了：
    “出发信号好啦？”
    又一个应答：
    “出发信号好啦！”
    看的人都大笑起来：
    “哈，长这么大，头一回见。”
    “羞死了啦，好意思那么大声喊。”
    “嘿，这是真负责，喊着点倒是少出事故。”
    一九三九号机车最积极，他们就问老英雄，那是什么名堂？是不是就叫“呼唤应答”？
    老英雄一说就是一大串：
    “这就叫呼唤应答，看信号道岔等等对不对？喊着引起注意，振作大家精神，防止事故。比如前方有什么了，就喊：前方注意！车出站时看后部没事情了，就喊：后部好啦！……”
    听的人越围越多，郑笃恭趁机会就给大家讲三锹制。末了还指着正在前进的机车，好像他还能见着司炉添煤似的说：
    “这三锹焚火法！就是司炉要勤一点；可是并不费劲，既省煤又省力，火又匀又旺，车开得好！”……（附图片）
