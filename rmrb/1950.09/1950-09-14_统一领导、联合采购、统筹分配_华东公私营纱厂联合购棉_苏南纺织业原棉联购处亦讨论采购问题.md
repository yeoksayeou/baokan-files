　　Unified Leadership, Joint Procurement, Unified Allocation
    East China Public-Private Yarn Factories Jointly Purchase Cotton
    Southern Jiangsu Textile Industry Raw Cotton Joint Procurement Office Also Discusses Procurement Issues
    [Report from this newspaper] According to Shanghai Jiefang Daily news: The East China Public-Private Yarn Factories Joint Cotton Purchasing Committee held its first committee meeting on September 8th. In addition to electing the standing committee members of the committee, it also adopted the "East China Public-Private Yarn Factories Joint Cotton Purchasing Method" and the "East China Public-Private Yarn Factories Joint Cotton Purchasing Committee Articles of Association." The joint cotton purchasing method mainly stipulates: 1. The Joint Cotton Purchasing Committee shall uniformly lead and plan all joint purchase businesses, and a Joint Purchase Office shall be established to handle daily affairs. 2. Cotton purchasing funds shall be contributed equally by the public and private sectors. The private sector part shall be contributed by each participating factory in proportion to the number of spindles they spin, based on actual needs, and shall be paid in full at the start-up, and adjusted every three months thereafter. Each factory may adjust its contribution based on the increase or decrease of its own spinning spindles. The public sector part will also be adjusted proportionally. 3. Cotton obtained from joint purchases in various places should be concentrated in designated warehouses according to actual conditions, and allocated according to the proportion of each unit's investment, setting a standard cotton consumption for each region, and making overall arrangements. The price will be settled and collected based on cost, with reference to local market conditions, in order to continue purchasing. After receiving the notice, each factory should complete the payment procedures to the Joint Cotton Purchasing Office or branch office within the prescribed period and pick up the goods nearby. Those who fail to pay within the prescribed period will be deemed to have waived the right to allocation for that period.
    Regarding the subscription and payment date of the joint purchase shares, it was decided that the standard would be 900 million yuan for every 10,000 spindles, and each factory should determine the total amount of subscription before September 15th according to the proportion of their own spinning spindles. It was also decided to pay in three installments on September 25th, October 3rd, and October 10th, with each installment paying one-third of the total subscription amount.
    The meeting also stipulated care measures for small yarn factories with less than 5,000 spindles. For example, if a small yarn factory does not participate in the first month of joint purchase during the three-month joint purchase period, it can still invest and participate in the second and third months, but it must submit a plan to the Joint Purchase Office in advance.
    [Report from this newspaper, Wuxi] The Southern Jiangsu Textile Industry Raw Cotton Joint Procurement Office held its sixth committee meeting from August 18th. The meeting discussed issues such as raw cotton procurement, transportation, and distribution, as well as how to ensure the supply and storage of raw cotton. Everyone had a clearer understanding of the concept of joint raw cotton purchase, and believed that this not only allows factories to avoid competition and mutual price increases after the new cotton comes on the market, but also achieves good results in the management of production areas and the inspection of products.

　　统一领导、联合采购、统筹分配
    华东公私营纱厂联合购棉
    苏南纺织业原棉联购处亦讨论采购问题
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报消息：华东公私营纱厂联合购棉委员会于九月八日举行首次委员会议，除推选出该委员会常务委员外，并通过“华东公私营纱厂联合购棉办法”及“华东公私营纱厂联合购棉委员会组织章程”。联合购棉办法中，主要规定：一、由联合购棉委员会统一领导并筹划一切联购业务，下设联购处办理日常事务。二、购棉资金，公私各半。私营部分，依据实际需要由参加各厂按自纺纱锭数比例认缴，于开办时缴足，以后每三月调整一次，各厂得视自纺纱锭的增减调整认缴资金。公营部分亦比例调整。三、各地联购所得棉花应按实际情况分别集中指定仓库，按各单位出资比例，订定各地区标准用棉量，统筹分配。并依据成本，参照各地市场情况结价收款，以备继续收购。各厂在接到通知后，应在规定期间向联合购棉处或办事处办理交款手续，就近提货，如不在规定期间交款者，作为放弃该期分配权利。
    又关于联购股款的认缴与交款日期，决定为每万纱锭认缴九亿元为标准，各厂按自纺纱锭数比例，在九月十五日以前确定认缴总数。并定九月二十五日，十月三日及十月十日三次分期交款，每期各交认缴总数的三分之一。
    对五千纱锭以下的小型纱厂，会议中亦规定了照顾的办法。如在三个月联购期间，小型纱厂不参加第一月联购，但第二、第三两月仍可投资参加，但须在事前向联购处提出计划。
    【本报无锡讯】苏南纺织工业原棉联购处，于八月十八日起曾召开第六次委员会议，会中讨论到原棉采购、运输、分配以及如何保证原棉供应、储运等问题，大家对原棉联购的概念，更为明确，且认为这不但在新花登场后使各厂本身可以避免竞争、互相抬价，并对产地的管理上，产品的检验上是更可获得很好的效果。（尹羊）
