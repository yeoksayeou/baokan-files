The soldiers' schistosomiasis has been eliminated.
    ——A Record of Model Medical Worker Professor Qian De
    In the suburbs of Shanghai, every People's Liberation Army soldier suffering from schistosomiasis has a common hope: "As long as that tall, bespectacled doctor comes to see me, I will get better." This doctor, highly regarded by the PLA patients, is Qian De, director of internal medicine at Zhongshan Hospital and professor at Shanghai Medical College.
    Dr. Qian De is the treatment consultant for the Shanghai suburban schistosomiasis prevention and control team, responsible for guiding medical treatment. He often visits various detachments to see patients, diagnose conditions, and solve medical and technical problems that general doctors cannot. During his four months of work in the army, he was not only highly skilled but also consistently proactive and responsible, tirelessly going everywhere in the wind, rain, and mud to diagnose and guide treatment. His sincere and meticulous care for patients quickly established his reputation among patients and the army.
  Serious, Responsible, and Untiring
    Whenever he arrived on patrol, he never rested due to the hardships of the journey. He always went to the ward as soon as he got off his horse or arrived at his destination. The material conditions in the countryside were poor, and some patients slept on the ground. He would kneel on the ground to examine them. During the examination, he was afraid that the patients would catch a cold, so he preferred to trouble himself and palpate the liver and spleen (one of the symptoms of schistosomiasis is hepatosplenomegaly) through their clothes. Once, in order to examine several critically ill patients, he walked more than ten miles in heavy wind and rain. The rain and sweat soaked his clothes, and the damp cotton coat became like heavy armor. He didn't finish the diagnosis and treatment until 8 p.m., and he was exhausted. At this time, someone reported that there was another patient in a dangerous situation three miles away. Hearing this, he ignored his own fatigue and hurried to the patient's place in the dark.
  Pay Attention to Saving People's Property and Helping Health Workers Learn
    Professor Qian is not only serious and responsible in his treatment work but also in protecting the people's property and other matters. He suggested using saline dilution instead of glucose solution dilution, which saved the country 100 to 200 million yuan. He suggested using riboflavin instead of yeast tablets to treat patients deficient in riboflavin. In terms of content and efficacy, one riboflavin tablet is equivalent to one hundred yeast tablets, and in terms of value, it is at least ten times cheaper. He also suggested holding training courses for army health workers. He took time out of his busy schedule to teach at the training courses and personally wrote teaching materials to meet the needs of army health workers.
    In terms of medical technology, Professor Qian has a research spirit. Since several patient soldiers unfortunately sacrificed themselves, the Prevention and Control Committee stipulated that all patients who had not been confirmed before starting treatment should be injected with a dose of up to one gram. He firmly advocated that attention should be paid to the patient's rest, and the dose should be determined by the standard of body weight. After this correction and attention, it was of great benefit to the patient. Professor Qian also designed and formulated a schistosomiasis history examination record form and statistical form, which is of great help for studying and analyzing the condition. Due to these many work achievements and service spirit, Professor Qian De was honorably rated as a second-class meritorious cadre in the award for medical workers going to the countryside.
  Ideological Understanding Improved Through Work in the Countryside
    Professor Qian started working in the countryside to serve the people from the perspective of his medical profession. He said to reporters: "To be honest, when I first went to the countryside, it was entirely from a technical point of view. I thought that where there are patients, doctors should go. There was not much political understanding of serving the PLA and supporting the liberation of Taiwan. Moreover, due to the deception of the Kuomintang's anti-propaganda in the past, I was somewhat suspicious of the Communist Party. However, what I saw and heard after going to the countryside, and living with the PLA, and seeing their hard and simple style and spirit of sacrificing themselves, deeply moved me. The things that the Communist Party promoted were confirmed by the masses. I made friends with many ordinary people, and they all said in unison: The People's Government and the People's Liberation Army have never wasted the people's blood and sweat; the People's Liberation Army is the army with the best discipline. These vivid facts dispelled the doubts in my heart. I fully understand why the People's Liberation Army can win battles, because they are a truly conscious and cultured team." Then he said: "In the past, the hospital gate was open to the public, but those who were sick and had no money could not enter. It was entirely for the service of a few people. Today, we must change our outlook on life, face the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and truly use science and technology to serve the people and seek happiness for mankind."

### 战士们的血吸虫病被消灭了——记模范医务工作者钱德教授

　　战士们的血吸虫病被消灭了
    ——记模范医务工作者钱德教授
    在上海郊区，每个害血吸虫病的人民解放军战士有一个共同的希望，就是：“只要那个高高个子的戴眼镜的医生来看我，我就会好了。”这位被解放军病员所器重的医生，就是中山医院内科主任、上海医学院教授——钱德医士。
    钱德医士是沪郊血吸虫防治大队的治疗顾问，负责医药治疗指导工作。他经常要到各个分队去视看病员，诊断病情，解决一般医生所不能解决的医药和技术问题。他在部队四个月的工作当中，不但技术高，而且一贯积极负责，不辞劳苦的在风雨泥泞中到处去诊治指导，他真诚、细致的关心病员，因此，他很快的就在病员和部队中树立了声望。
  认真负责不辞劳苦
    他每次巡视到那里，从未因旅途辛劳而稍事休息，总是一下马或一走到目的地，就走向病房。乡下物质条件差，有的病员是睡在地上的，他就跪在地下为他们检查，在检查过程中，他怕病员着凉，宁可自己多麻烦些，就隔着衣裳去抚摸肝脾（血吸虫病征之一是肝脾肿大）。有一次，他为了诊视几个重病员，在大风雨中，步行了十几里，雨水和汗水浸透了衣裳，潮湿的棉衣竟成了沉重的甲胄似的。从下午一时直到晚间八时才诊治完毕，人已精疲力倦了。正在这时候，有人来报告，在三里路外又有一个病员情况很危险，他听了，不顾自己的疲劳，连忙摸着黑路到病员那儿去了。
  注意节省人民财产帮助卫生人员学习
    钱教授不但在治疗工作上认真负责，在爱护人民财产和其他事件上也是如此。他建议用盐水稀释代替葡萄糖液稀释，这样就节省了国家一亿到二亿元。他建议用核黄素代替酵母片，医治缺乏核黄素的病员。就含量及效用来说，一片核黄素可抵一百片酵母片，就价值来说，最少要便宜十倍。他又建议举办部队卫生工作人员讲习班，他自己在百忙中抽出时间到讲习班去教学，并亲自编写讲义，以适合部队卫生工作者的要求。
    在医学技术上，钱教授是具有研究精神的。自从有几位病员战士不幸牺牲以后，防治委员会规定凡未经证实而开始治病的病人，都注射剂量至一克为止，他则坚决主张应该注意病员的休息，剂量以体重的标准来决定。经此修正和注意后，对病员有莫大好处。钱教授还另外设计拟制了一种血吸虫病史检查记录表和统计表，这对研究、分析病情，有着很大帮助。由于这许多工作成绩和服务精神，在下乡医务工作者评奖中，钱德教授终于光荣地被评为干部二等功臣了。
  通过下乡工作思想认识提高
    钱教授开始下乡为人民服务，是从他作医生的业务观点出发的。他对记者说：“老实说，我开始下乡，完全是技术观点，认为那里有病人，医生就该去，并没有太多的为解放军服务和支援解放台湾的政治认识，而且，由于过去受国民党的反宣传蒙蔽，对共产党是有些怀疑的。但是，下乡后所见所闻，以及和解放军生活在一起，看到他们坚苦朴素作风，牺牲自我的精神，使我深受感动。共产党所宣传的事情，我在群众口中得到证实。我和很多老百姓交了朋友，他们异口同声地说：人民政府和解放军是没有浪费过人民血汗的；解放军是纪律最好的军队。这些活生生的事实，解除了我心里的疑团，我完全了解了解放军为什么能打胜仗，因为他们是真正的自觉的有文化的队伍。”接着他又说：“过去医院大门八字开，有病无钱勿进来，是完全为少数人服务的。我们今天必须要改变人生观，要面向工农兵，把科学技术真正用来为人民服务，为人类谋幸福。”
