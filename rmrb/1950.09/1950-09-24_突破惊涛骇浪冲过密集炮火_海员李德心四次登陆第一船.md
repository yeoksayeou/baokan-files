Breaking Through Stormy Waves and Rushing Through Dense Firepower
　　Sailor Li Dexin Was First to Land Four Times
　　Breaking through stormy waves, regardless of flying artillery fire, young and heroic Wuhan sailor Li Dexin, driving his Assault No. 16 landing craft, strived to be the first to land four times in the island-by-island landing battle to liberate the Wanshan Islands. Under the enemy's dense fire, he resolutely carried out orders from his superiors and swam to rescue comrades who had fallen into the sea. His heroic deeds will forever be admired by the people. He has been honorably elected as a representative of Wuhan to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.
　　Li Dexin Participated in the War While Sick, Striving for Merit and Joining the Party
　　On May 23rd, when the river defense fleet departed from the naval base to attack the garbage tail islands of the Wanshan Islands, Comrade Li Dexin was suffering from malaria. He heroically stood up and dragged his sick body to participate in this campaign. Before departing, he, like other comrades, cleaned guns, fueled, and repaired ships. Because he always remembered that he was a member of the Communist Youth League, he wanted to resolutely complete the tasks assigned to him by the Party. On his twelve-point merit plan, he wrote his oath: "Guarantee to resolutely implement the plan, temper myself in actual tests…strive for merit and join the Party." The oath was fulfilled to the letter.
　　Rushing Through Intense Firepower, Finally Gaining the First Landing Boat
　　In the dawn of the 25th, the attack on the enemy naval headquarters—Garbage Tail—began. Li Dexin drove Assault No. 16 and other ships together, engaging in an attack battle with the enemy's welcoming fleet on the Garbage Tail sea. Our gunboats, with the brave action of a sharp knife straight in, finally defeated the enemy fleet's resistance. Those sunk were sunk, those on fire were on fire, and in desperation, the enemy ships fired a dense barrage at our No. 16 landing craft, which had no heavy firepower. Shells stirred up water columns more than ten feet high on the left and right of the boat, and a rain of machine gun bullets pierced the clear sky of dawn, shooting back and forth across the bridge. The steel plate above Li Dexin's head was blown through by shrapnel, but he still calmly and resolutely carried out his task in an emergency. He did not consider his own life, held the rudder so steadily, and kept rushing forward, finally landing victoriously. He won the first landing boat in the first battle of the Wanshan Islands.
　　Accepting Orders Again, Bravely Rescuing Comrades
　　Not long after landing, suddenly a small electric vessel (i.e., small steamship) following was sunk by an enemy ship during the landing, and comrades on board jumped into the water one after another. The enemy's dense artillery fire did not stop, and Assault No. 16 received an urgent order from its superiors, "Rescue comrades who have fallen into the water!" Li Dexin did not hesitate, and No. 16 plunged back into the enemy's fire net. No one could swim in the stormy waves, so he bravely took on this task again. With the help and cooperation of other comrades, all fifteen comrades who jumped into the water were rescued.
　　On the 29th, our powerful fleet continued to conquer Great and Small Spider Islands; on the 31st, an offensive was launched and Dongao and other islands were conquered; on June 4th, Baili, Great and Small Wanshan, Zhuzhou and other islands were conquered again. In the island-by-island landing and annihilation battle of the Wanshan Islands, Li Dexin drove the Assault No. 16 landing craft for more than ten landings, of which four times he strived for the first landing boat.
　　Bravery is Inseparable from Responsibility, Li Dexin Cares About Ships
　　Bravery is inseparable from responsibility, and Li Dexin is exactly like that. He is especially concerned about ships, more precious than his own life. Because he knows that this is the lifeline of the naval battle and the entire army. Sometimes he would get up in the middle of the night to guard the ship silently. When the weather was rainy and the wind and waves were high, he was even more worried and would not even go to sleep all night. On the night when the attack on Outer Lingding Island was about to take place, he put the alarm clock on his bedside table, turned it to the time he needed, and when the bell rang, he climbed up alone to loosen the front cable and tighten the rear anchor, pulling the boat out of the beach to avoid delaying time when carrying out the mission. Whenever the ship was stranded for rescue or to go ashore to tie or untie cables, he was always the first to jump into the sea and swim.
　　He is a Hero in Battle, and a Good Assistant in Navigation
　　Li Dexin is a hero in battle, and he is also a good assistant to the car driver (chief driver) on the ship in normal times. Carrying batteries, taking chargers, moving oil drums, fueling… in addition to the odd jobs on the engine, he is also responsible for cooking and cooking on the sail cable. He doesn’t relax as long as he can.
　　With the troops, he is a good brother to the soldiers. He explained to the soldiers who had never experienced life on the water how not to get seasick and helped them get used to life on the water. In the transportation task, he personally helped the soldiers carry weapons and transport supplies; not only helping to transport them into the ship, but also helping to carry them ashore. The comrades in the army are especially nice to the No. 16 landing craft, and many units sent letters to the No. 16 landing craft after leaving to express their gratitude. Some took pictures with them on the landing beach and also gave gifts. The soldiers' feelings for the No. 16 landing craft are deep, and they will always remember the model sailor Li Dexin and other sailor brothers.

　　突破惊涛骇浪冲过密集炮火
    海员李德心四次登陆第一船
    突破惊涛骇浪，不顾纷飞炮火，年青英勇的武汉海员李德心，驾驶着他的突击１６号登陆艇，在解放万山群岛的逐岛登陆战中，争取了四次登陆第一船。在敌人密集炮火下，坚决执行上级命令，泅水抢救落海同志。他的英雄事迹，将永远为人民敬仰。这次已光荣的当选为武汉出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。
  李德心带病参战，争取立功入党
    五月二十三日当江防舰艇队在海军基地出发，攻击万山群岛垃圾尾岛屿的时候，李德心同志正在发疟疾。他英勇的站起来拖着病身子参加了这个战役。出发前和其他同志一样擦枪炮、灌油料、修船只。因为他时时都在记着自己是一个青年团员，他要坚决完成党交给他的任务。在他的十二条立功计划书上，写着他的誓词：“保证坚决实现计划，在实际考验中锻炼自己………争取立功入党。”誓词是不折不扣地实现了。
  冲过猛烈的炮火，终获登陆第一船
    二十五日晨曦中，向敌人海军指挥部所在地——垃圾尾的攻击开始了。李德心驾着突击１６号和其他舰艇一道，在垃圾尾海面上与敌人迎击的舰群展开了攻击战。我们的炮艇以尖刀直插的勇猛动作，终于击溃了敌舰群的阻袭。击沉的击沉，起火的起火，敌舰在仓皇无奈中，便密集火力向我没有重火力的１６号登陆艇射击，炮弹在船的左右激起丈多高的水柱，骤雨般的机枪弹突破晨曦的晴空穿梭一般地射过驾驶台。李德心头顶的钢板被弹片炸穿了，他还是刚毅沉着地在紧急的情况下执行他的任务。他没有考虑到自己的生命，舵撑的那么稳，一直向前冲去，终于胜利登陆了。在万山群岛首次战役中争取了登陆第一船。
  再次接受命令，奋勇营救同志
    登陆后不久，忽然后续的一只小电?（即小汽船），在登陆途中被敌舰击沉，船上同志纷纷跳水。敌人密集的炮火并未停止，突击１６号得到了上级紧急命令，“营救落水同志！”李德心并未迟疑，１６号重又投入了敌人的火网。没有人能在狂涛骇浪中泅水，他又奋勇地担起了这项任务。在其他同志帮助配合下，十五位跳水同志全得到了营救。
    二十九日我强大舰艇队继克大小蜘蛛岛；三十一日发动攻势又克东澳等岛；六月四日再克白沥、大小万山、竹洲诸岛，总计在万山群岛逐岛登陆歼灭战中，李德心驾驶着突击１６号登陆艇，先后十余次进行登陆，其中有四次争取了登陆第一船。
  英勇与负责分不开，李德心关心着船只
    英勇与负责是分不开的，李德心也正是这样。他特别关心船只，比关心他的生命还要宝贵。因为他知道这是海战以及全军的生命线。有时一个人不声不响，半夜起来守船。当雨天风浪大时，他就更担心，甚至一夜都不去睡觉。在要攻击外伶仃岛的当晚，他就把闹钟放在床头上，扭到他所需要的时间，到时候铃一响，一个人就爬起来松去前缆收紧后锚，把船拉出沙滩，避免出发执行任务时耽搁时间。每逢船只搁浅营救或上岸系缆解缆，他都是抢先跳海游水者。
  战斗中是英雄，航行中也是好助手
    李德心在战斗中是英雄，在日常的船上他也是大车（驾驶长）的好助手。背电瓶、拿充电机、搬油桶、加油……除了轮机上的杂活，还担负着帆缆上的烧饭煮菜工作。只要能下手的，他都不放松。
    与部队在一起，他是战士们的好弟兄。他向没有经历过水上生活的战士们解释怎样才不会晕船，帮助他们习惯水上生活。在担任运输任务中，亲自动手帮助战士搬武器，运给养；不但帮助运进船，还要帮助搬上岸。部队同志对１６号登陆艇都特别要好，很多单位在离去后都写信向１６号登陆艇致谢。有的在登陆的海边上与他们照了像，还送了礼物。战士们与１６号登陆艇的感情是深厚的，他们也永恒惦记着模范海员李德心和其他的海员弟兄。          （摘自长江日报）（附图片）
