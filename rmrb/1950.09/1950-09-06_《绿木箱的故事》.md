　　《The Story of the Green Wooden Box》
　　Written by Huaxilian Ke, Adapted by He Yi, Published by Tianxia Book Company
　　This is a fairy tale, with a light, lively, and attractive writing style, suitable for children of junior high school level to read.
　　The story is as follows: The protagonist, Huani, was placed in the city of Nochick at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains because his hometown was occupied by the German invaders. He often felt lonely and missed his hometown. Later, he met Shawuer, and his life changed. Shawuer was a brave and determined child who told Huani the fairy tale of the Blue Stone. This fairy tale symbolizes happiness and the historical struggle of the working people in pursuing and creating happiness. After finishing the fairy tale, Shawuer introduced him to the embodiment of the Blue Stone, a real person - Grandpa Bolang, who always carried a green wooden box with him, and people called him "Bolang who delivers happiness," and the green wooden box was the source of happiness. In addition, they also met Aidili, a clever girl. There was also a blind grandpa who played the flute well, symbolizing the voice of love and the kindness of the Soviet people. Later, the German invaders occupied the city of Nochick. At this time, a man who crawled out of the grave, the undead landlord Altai, colluded with the German invaders and used various threats and inducements to try to get Grandpa Bolang's green wooden box. Grandpa Bolang was not subdued. Altai and the German invaders came up with even more cruel methods, trying to bring Grandpa Bolang's beloved granddaughter, Shuma, and burn her in front of him. At this time, Huani, Shawuer, Aidili, and Grandpa Bolang all mobilized separately, combined with the local guerrillas to rescue Grandpa Bolang and Shuma, and preserved the green wooden box. Later, Bolang joined the guerrillas, and he gave the green wooden box to the three children. And said: "Take this as a souvenir. There is no blue stone that brings a happy life in the wooden box. I tell you, this is just a fairy tale. But this fairy tale has a truth. What is the truth? That is, everyone wants to live a happy life, and everyone should create happiness with their own hands. What exactly is in this little green wooden box? Only some small helpers to help people work. Because I used these helpers to create a lot of happiness for people, everyone said that I was living a blue life." "Children, the fascist mad dogs have already trampled on the blue flowers on our territory and destroyed countless magnificent cities! But these mad dogs will surely perish! We will surely be able to build more magnificent new cities on the ruins and cultivate more beautiful flowers!" This passage is the theme of "The Story of the Green Wooden Box."
　　Huani, Shawuer, Aidili, Grandpa Bolang, and the blind old man, these five people represent the character of the Soviet people in the new society: brave, alert, kind, intelligent, hardworking, unselfish, pursuing truth, and an unshakable belief in seeking happiness for mankind.
　　This fairy tale is so beautiful, light, interesting, and even magical in form, that it really has the power to make you read it all at once. And the theme is so serious and profound. It is not only educational for children, but also adults can get a lot of enlightenment from it.
　　Finally, I must also introduce that the work of making foreign masterpieces Chinese and popular, this "Story of the Green Wooden Box", is a relatively successful one.

　　《绿木箱的故事》
    华西连柯原著  贺宜改编  天下图书公司版
    这是一篇童话，文笔轻松活泼，富于吸引力，适合初中程度的儿童阅读。
    故事是这样的：主人公华尼因为家乡被德寇侵占，被安置在高加索山下的诺其克城里。他时常感到孤独，怀念家乡。后来他认识了沙五儿，他的生活有了转变。沙五儿是一个勇敢坚定的孩子，他给华尼讲了蓝石头的童话。这童话象征着幸福，和劳动人民追求幸福、创造幸福的斗争历史。沙五儿在童话结束后，又介绍他认识了蓝石头的化身、真实的人——柏朗公公，他一刻不离身的背着一只绿木箱，人们都叫他“送幸福的柏朗”，绿木箱则是幸福的源泉。另外他们又结识了艾迪丽——一个机警的女孩子。还有一个瞎眼的公公，他吹得一手好笛子，象征着爱的声音和苏维埃人民的善良。后来德寇占领了诺其克城。这时，一个从坟墓里爬出来的人，未死的地主阿尔泰，勾结着德寇，用了各种威胁利诱的方式，企图得到柏朗公公的绿木箱。柏朗公公不为所屈。阿尔泰和德寇就想出了更加残酷的办法，想把柏朗公公最心爱的外孙女淑玛弄来，当着他的面用火烧。这时，华尼、沙五儿、艾迪丽、柏朗公公都分头动员起来，结合着当地的游击队员营救了柏朗公公和淑玛，并保住了绿木箱。后来柏朗参加了游击队，他把木绿箱送给了这三个小朋友。并且说：“把这拿去作为纪念吧。木箱里面，并没有带幸福生活来的蓝石头啊。告诉你们，这只是童话。但是这童话却有一种道理。什么道理呢？就是人人想过幸福的生活，人人应当亲手去创造幸福。这小绿木箱里究竟有些什么东西呢？只有些帮助人们劳动的小小助手。我因为用这些助手，给人创造了许多快乐，所以大家说我是过的蓝色生活。”“孩子们啊，法西斯疯狗已经在我们领土上践踏了蓝色鲜花，毁坏了无数的华丽城市！但是这些疯狗一定会灭亡的！我们一定可以在废墟上建设更华丽的新城市，培植出更美丽的鲜花的！”这段话，就是《绿木箱的故事》的主题思想。
    华尼、沙五儿、艾迪丽、柏朗公公、瞎眼老人，他们五个人代表着新社会苏维埃人民的性格：勇敢，机警，仁慈，聪明，爱劳动，不自私，追求真理及为人类谋幸福的坚不可拔的信念。
    这个童话，形式是那末美丽、轻松、有趣，甚至于神奇，真有使你一气读完的力量。而主题思想又是那末严肃、深刻。它不但对儿童富有教育意义，就是对成人也会从它里面得到不少的教益。
    末了，还得介绍一下，把外国名著中国化、通俗化的工作，这一本《绿木箱的故事》，是作得比较成功的。
