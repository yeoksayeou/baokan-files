Xinhua News Agency, September 25th—The full text of the opening address by Chen Yun, Vice Premier of the State Council of the Central People's Government, at the National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, is as follows:

　　The National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers have opened. I celebrate the success of these two conferences.

　　On the eve of the first National Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the convening of these two grand conferences is of great significance. At present, all the territory of our country, except for Tibet and Taiwan, has been liberated. The nation's financial and economic situation has initially improved. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the people of the whole country are working hard to liberate all of our territory and strive for a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation. Internationally, American imperialists are expanding their war of aggression. The Chinese people are fighting alongside the people of the world to defend world peace and oppose wars of aggression. In this situation, convening these two grand conferences, bringing together representatives of outstanding combat heroes and labor models from the military and economic fronts across the country to exchange experiences and learn from each other, is of great significance for encouraging the people of the whole country to defend world peace, liberate Tibet and Taiwan, further restore and develop our country's economic construction enthusiasm, and improve the level of heroes and models so they can play a greater backbone and leading role.

　　In the liberation war of the past few years, countless combat heroes, models of support for the front, labor models, and factory protection models have emerged in the front and rear. The victory of the Liberation War is inseparable from their efforts. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China a year ago, brilliant achievements have been made on both the military and economic fronts. In the fourth year of the People's Liberation War, the heroic People's Liberation Army annihilated more than 2.37 million enemies and liberated all the territory and people except Tibet and Taiwan. Now, the People's Liberation Army is intensifying training, improving its skills, actively preparing to liberate Tibet and Taiwan, and also participating in production themselves to reduce the burden on the people. On the economic front, we have reversed the long-term chaotic situation of China's financial and economic affairs, implemented unified management of financial and economic affairs, balanced revenue and expenditure, stabilized prices, and begun to adjust industry and commerce, striving for initial improvements in the financial and economic situation. Over the past year, our industrial and agricultural production has shown a gradual upward trend. We have achieved a general bumper harvest in both the summer and autumn seasons this year, with grain and cotton production greatly exceeding the production increase plan. We are now self-sufficient in grain, and cotton production is close to the needs of the textile industry. China is a country where the agricultural economy occupies an absolute advantage, but during the Kuomintang rule, large amounts of grain and cotton were imported every year. This situation has undergone tremendous changes within a year of the establishment of the Central People's Government. This is a major event, a result of the joint efforts of all aspects of the agricultural front. In the old liberated areas, we advocated intensive cultivation, improved technology, organized ourselves, and developed production. In the new areas, we concentrated our efforts to eliminate bandits, stabilize order, and implement policies of rewarding production and reasonable burden. In this way, we used the method of developing production to overcome last year's severe drought and strive for a bumper harvest in both seasons this year, allowing the people, who had endured long-term warfare, to begin to breathe a sigh of relief.

　　In terms of industrial production, the achievements of the past year have also been significant. The nation's railways have been restored to traffic. Many factories destroyed by the Kuomintang bandits have been restored, and some units in certain enterprise departments have even exceeded the production levels before the war and during the Japanese occupation. Taking the Northeast as an example, the total value of state-owned industrial production this year will be equal to 193% of last year, and the proportion of industry will increase to 43% of the national economy in the entire Northeast region. After reasonably adjusting industry and commerce, private industry and commerce have also begun to improve, and labor-management relations in private enterprises have also greatly improved.

　　Comrades! How were these achievements obtained?

　　First, it is due to the correct leadership of Chairman Mao. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the People's Republic of China was established on October 1st last year. Since then, our people have been freed from the status of being oppressed and enslaved, and our people have stood up. Our country is led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The people of the whole country are united around Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, working diligently and striving together. This guarantees that we will always move towards victory. Secondly, the acquisition of these achievements is inseparable from the efforts of all of you present here. You, the combat heroes and labor models, are the kind of people who, in battle, eliminate the enemy with a spirit of bravery and fearlessness; and in labor, conduct production and work with the new labor attitude of being the masters of the country. Your fighting spirit and labor attitude are models for the entire People's Liberation Army and examples for the working people of the whole country. You unite millions upon millions of people, jointly striving for the beautiful future of our country. Without you leading figures and the concerted efforts of the people of the whole country, it would have been impossible to achieve the achievements of our country in the past year.

　　The State Council is convening representatives of combat heroes from the national armed forces to meet in order to inspire the entire army, strengthen military training, improve the level of culture, and master the art of modern warfare, so that we can build our Liberation Army into a completely modern national defense force, liberate Tibet and Taiwan, oppose the increasingly expanded aggression of American imperialism, and defend world peace. Convening representatives of labor models from all aspects of national public and private enterprises to meet is in order to encourage workers in national public and private enterprises and institutions to promote a new labor attitude and improve labor productivity; encourage farmers across the country to implement production mutual aid, improve farming techniques, and increase agricultural production. Encourage the People's Liberation Army personnel participating in various production work to continue to do it themselves, expand production results, improve their own lives, and reduce the burden on the people. In short, it is to concentrate the heroic deeds and inventions of you representatives through these two conferences, that is, to concentrate the wisdom of the working people of the whole country, promote them, and lead the people of the whole country to devote themselves to liberating all the territory, developing production, prospering the economy, and building the great cause of a new China.

　　Comrades! These two meetings will last for five or six days, listening to reports from many representatives and also listening to reports from several responsible personnel. The purpose is to exchange experiences, learn from each other, and make our various tasks better. So, in what spirit should we participate in these two meetings? Comrades! I believe that we should participate in these two meetings with a spirit of humbly learning. The people's heroes are produced from the people. Only by being with the broad masses, humbly learning from the masses, and concentrating their experiences and wisdom can we lead them, promote them, and truly exert the "bridge, backbone, and leading role" mentioned by Chairman Mao. The reason why heroes are valuable is that they can connect with the masses, transform the opinions and instructions of the leading organs into the opinions of the broad masses through the experience of the masses, so that the broad masses can act; and also reflect the opinions and requirements of the masses to the leading organs, providing them for research and adoption. This is the bridge role. Heroes and models must be able to lead the masses, must fully understand the requirements of the masses, and use experience that the masses can accept to persuade them. In this way, combined with their own exemplary role, they can serve as the backbone and lead the way among the masses. Therefore, an important point is to connect with the masses and unite the masses. A hero, as soon as he separates from the masses, immediately becomes powerless and ineffective. At the same time, we know that the reason for the success of any labor model is not only because he has the new labor attitude of being the master of the country, but also because he can accept technical knowledge and combine technical knowledge with labor experience. Without this combination, it would be impossible to achieve the past labor results and improve the future labor efficiency. Therefore, workers, peasants, and technicians must unite and work together to restore and develop the country's economy.

　　Our conference will proceed in this way, and we will achieve the goals expected by the conference.

　　陈云副总理致开幕词
    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民政府政务院陈云副总理在全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议开幕式上的开幕词，全文如下：
    全国战斗英雄代表会议与工农兵劳动模范代表会议开幕了，我庆祝这两个会议的成功。
    在中华人民共和国成立后第一个国庆日的前夕，召开这两个盛大的会议，其意义是很重大的。现在我们的国家，除西藏、台湾以外的国土，已经全部解放了。国家的财政经济已经得到了初步好转。全国人民在毛主席及中央人民政府领导下，正为解放全部国土，争取财政经济的根本好转而努力。在国际方面，美帝国主义者正在扩大侵略战争，中国人民正在和世界人民一起，为了维护世界和平，反对侵略战争而斗争。在这种情况下，召开这样两个盛大的会议，把全国军事战线上和经济战线上出色的战斗英雄和劳动模范的代表集合在一起，交流经验，互相学习，这对于鼓励全国人民保卫世界和平，解放西藏、台湾，进一步恢复与发展我国经济建设的热情，以及提高英雄和模范的水平，使能发挥更大的骨干带头作用，都有重大的意义。
    在几年来的解放战争中，在前线后方，出现了无数的战斗英雄，支援前线的模范，劳动模范，和护厂模范。解放战争的胜利，是和他们的努力分不开的。中华人民共和国成立一年以来，无论在军事战线上，在经济战线上，又都取得了光辉的成绩。在人民解放战争的第四年度，英勇的人民解放军共歼灭敌人二百三十七万余人，解放了除西藏，台湾以外的全部国土和人民。现在人民解放军正在一方面加紧练兵，提高技术，积极准备解放西藏、台湾，一方面自己动手参加生产，减轻人民的负担。在经济战线上，我们扭转了中国财政经济长期混乱的局面，实行了财政经济的统一管理，平衡了收支，稳定了物价，开始调整了工商业，争取了财政经济的初步好转。这一年以来我们的工农生产呈现着一种逐步上涨的局面。我们取得了今年夏秋两季的一般丰收，粮食、棉花的生产大大地超过了增产计划。我们的粮食已能自给，棉花产量接近了纺织工业的需要。中国是一个农业经济占绝对优势的国家，但在国民党统治时期，每年却有大量的粮食和棉花输入。这种情况，在中央人民政府成立一年之内，就发生了巨大的改变，这是一件大事，是农业战线上各个方面共同努力的结果。在老解放区，我们提倡精耕细作，改进技术，组织起来，发展生产；在新区，我们集中力量，剿灭土匪，安定秩序，实行奖励生产和合理负担的政策。这样，我们就用发展生产的办法，战胜了去年的严重灾荒，争取了今年两季丰收，使长期战争之后的人民开始松了一口气。
    在工业生产方面，一年的成绩也是很大的。全国的铁路已经恢复通车了。许多被国民党匪帮破坏的工厂已经恢复了，若干企业部门的若干单位，且已超过战争以前及日寇统治时期的生产水平。以东北为例，今年公营工业生产总值将等于去年的百分之一百九十三，工业的比重将增至东北全区国民经济的百分之四十三。在合理地调整工商业以后，私营工商业也开始了好转，私营企业中劳资关系，也有了很大的改善。
    同志们！这些成绩是怎样得来的呢？
    首先，是由于毛主席的正确领导。在毛主席领导下，中华人民共和国于去年十月一日成立了，从此，我国人民摆脱了被压迫被奴役的地位，我国人民已经站立起来了。我们的国家是由共产党、毛主席领导的，全国人民团结在毛主席与中央人民政府的周围，兢兢业业，共同奋斗，这就保证了我们永远走向胜利。其次，这些成绩的获得，与在座诸位的努力是分不开的。你们诸位战斗英雄和劳动模范是这样的一种人物：在战斗中，以英勇无畏的精神，消灭敌人；在劳动中，以国家主人翁的新的劳动态度，进行生产和工作。你们的战斗精神和劳动态度，是全体人民解放军的模范，是全国劳动人民的表率。你们团结着千千万万的人民，共同为我们国家的美丽远景而奋斗。没有你们这些带头分子以及全国人民的一致奋斗，我们国家一年来的成绩的获得，就是不可能的。
    政务院召集全国部队中的战斗英雄的代表来开会，是为了激励全军，加强练兵，提高文化程度和掌握现代战争的艺术，把我们的解放军建设成完全现代化的国防军，解放西藏台湾，反对美帝国主义日益扩大的侵略，保卫世界和平。召集全国公私企业中各方面的劳动模范的代表来开会，是为了鼓励全国公私企业机关的工人，发扬新的劳动态度，提高劳动生产率；鼓励全国农民实行生产互助，改进耕作技术，增加农业生产。鼓励参加各种生产工作的人民解放军，继续自己动手，扩大生产成果，改善自己的生活，减轻人民的负担。总之，是为了通过这两个大会，把诸位代表的英勇事迹与发明创造集中起来，也就是说，把全国劳动人民的智慧集中起来，加以推广，以便领导全国人民共同致力于解放全部国土，发展生产，繁荣经济，建设新中国的伟大事业。
    同志们！这两个会议将要开五六天会，听取许多代表的报告，也要听取若干负责人员的报告，目的是交流经验，互相学习，把我们的各种工作作得更好一些。那么，我们应该按照什么精神来参加这两个会议呢？同志们！我认为我们应该以虚心学习的精神来参加这两个会议。人民的英雄是从人民中产生出来的，只有和广大群众一起，虚心向群众学习，集中他们的经验和智慧，然后才能领导他们，推动他们前进，真正发挥毛主席所说的“桥梁，骨干与带头作用”。英雄所以可贵，就在于他能联系群众，把领导机关的意见和指示，通过群众的经验，变成广大群众的意见，使广大群众行动起来；又把群众的意见和要求反映到领导机关来，供给领导机关研究采择。这就是桥梁作用。英雄模范要能领导群众，必须十分懂得群众的要求，用群众可能接受的经验去说服他们，这样，再配合自己的模范作用，就能在群众中作骨干，当带头的人。因此，重要的一条就是联系群众，团结群众，英雄只要脱离了群众，立刻就变得没有力量，没有作用了。同时，我们晓得，任何劳动模范成功的原因，不但因为他有国家主人翁的新的劳动态度，而且因为他能够接受技术知识，使技术知识与劳动经验相结合，如果没有这种结合，那么，过去的劳动成果的取得和今后劳动成效的提高，也是不可能的。因此，工人农民与技术人员必须团结起来，为恢复和发展国家的经济而共同奋斗。
    我们的大会将这样作去、我们将达到大会所预期的目的。
