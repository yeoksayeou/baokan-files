　　The Ordos Grassland Before and After Liberation
    ——Commemorating the First Anniversary of the Liberation of the Yikezhao League

    In late spring and early summer, when hundreds of grasses grew, the reporter stepped into the Ordos Grassland (Yikezhao League). The area is 1,300 meters above sea level, occupying nearly one-third of the entire Suiyuan province. The entire league is divided into seven banners, one county, and two directly subordinate districts, scattered with nearly 100,000 Mongolians and 250,000 Han people. Mongolians mostly live by nomadism, while Han people are engaged in agricultural production. The grassland has a lot of wind and sand and little rain, which is not suitable for crop growth; however, the grass everywhere is an excellent pasture. In addition, there is the nationally famous Mayajiao Lake, and the Northwest famous salt lake, as well as fur, licorice and other products. However, this rich Ordos Grassland, under the bloody rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries' Han chauvinism in the past, became a boundless hell on earth! On September 19th last year, the entire territory of the Yimeng League was liberated (Jungar Banner was liberated in 1948). After a year of construction, the suffering grassland began to move towards a new life.

    Speaking of the Past with Grief and Indignation
    In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang concentrated a large number of special agents and nearly 20,000 bandit troops in the Yimeng League, determined to transform the Ordos Grassland into their "base for preventing Japan and opposing communism" (the grassland is backed by the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region and faces the Japanese-occupied Sui and Baotou). The bandits plundered more than 100,000 mu of the most fertile pastures in various banners. In 1943, bandit Chen Changjie (commander of the Yimeng puppet garrison) implemented armed "land reclamation" (army forced reclamation), reaching the vicinity of the Wangfu of Jung Wang Banner and the forbidden area of the Mausoleum of Genghis Khan in the Jasak Banner (Mongolian people prohibited reclamation of the Genghis Khan Mausoleum site). Due to the shrinking of pastures and the disaster of plague, the number of livestock decreased sharply. For example, Jung Wang Banner had 140,000 livestock in 1942, but only 60,000 remained by 1948. Following the reclamation of pastures, counties were established in place of banners, and the Baojia system was promoted. Every year, the people of the entire banner were extorted for 20 to 30 kinds of exorbitant taxes and levies. The Jungar Banner produced a maximum of 120,000 shi of grain throughout the year, and various donations and taxes accounted for 80,000 shi. Mongolians and Han people generally lived on coarse chaff, melons and vegetables. The bandits became more and more cruel to the hungry and cold people. In 1943, Chen Changjie's bandit army burned down more than half of the monasteries and houses in the Wu and Jasak banners, brutally killed more than 100 Mongolian men and women, and robbed countless treasures. In the Hala Tu Temple, they robbed all the property of a Mongolian family, and also gang-raped a seventeen-year-old girl, and forced the girl's grandfather to rape his own granddaughter. The Mongolian old man was so angry that he cried to the sky and said: "When the Kuomintang comes, the people on the grassland are doomed"!

    Heroic Struggle for Liberation
    "Countless stars, endless sand; who killed my parents, Manate (Mongolian for 'we') will not spare him." This folk song expresses the grassland people's hatred for the Kuomintang reactionaries and their longing for liberation.
    After 1937, there were many heroic struggles by the Mongolian people against the Kuomintang reactionaries on the grassland. Among them, the "Yimeng Incident" in 1943 was a large-scale resistance movement that shocked the country. On March 26th of that year, the military and civilians of Jasak Banner, led by Sha Wang, regardless of slaves, lamas, princes and "Taiji" (nobles), were all involved in the armed uprising against bandit Chen. Men and women participated in the banner security team, and women voluntarily sent tea and milk, slaughtered cattle and sheep to comfort the army. With a force ten times smaller than the enemy and armed without a single machine gun, they fought bloody battles for two months, annihilated more than 400 bandit Chen troops, and captured 30 guns of various types. The Jasak Banner army suffered only seven casualties. Due to the heroic resistance of the Mongolian people, the conspiracy of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to eliminate the Mongolian people with Chen's bandit army was shattered. After the Chiang bandit's armed suppression failed, they implemented a "mediation" conspiracy. As a result of the "mediation", the old company commander Lai, who organized the struggle, was killed, and the banner security commander Eqier Bashi, who commanded the battle, was forced to leave, and Sha Wang died of anger. Before his death, he was grateful for the sympathy and assistance given by the military and civilians of the Sanbian Liberated Area (belonging to the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region) in his difficulties. The Mongolian people generally said: "If you want the grassland to change, you still have to find the Communist Party." More than 200 Mongolians in Wushen Banner formed a guerrilla team to resist the Kuomintang bandit army. The number continued to expand, and in 1947 it was officially reorganized into the Second Detachment of the Yimeng People's Liberation Army. For seven years, they had conducted more than 100 large and small battles against the Kuomintang bandit army and cultivated a large number of outstanding Mongolian cadres.

    Light Shines on the Grassland
    "Without Chairman Mao, how could we have a way to live!" This has become the common voice of the Mongolian and Han people on the grassland after liberation.
    The Mongolian people of Jungar Banner, who were liberated earlier, Bai Yinmenken, were slaves for generations. He himself had lived as a slave for more than 30 years. After liberation, rent reduction was implemented, and he received land, five shi of grain, and two cattle. In the past, he gnawed grass roots and ate elm bark. Now, in addition to food and clothing, he can still have a surplus of three or four shi of grain. Last winter, he was elected as a representative to the first people's representative conference of the entire league. He said excitedly: "There are many people in Jungar Banner who have turned over like me." When the banner was first liberated in the summer of 1948, more than two-thirds of the families lacked three or four months of food. The banner people's government immediately allocated 1,000 shi of relief grain from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border region, and launched rent reduction and production for self-rescue. In the past two years (from 1948 to 1950), the population, land, and livestock have greatly developed. In 1948, there was less than one head of livestock per ten households on average in the banner, but by 1950, there was more than one head per household on average. In 1948, 70% of the cultivated land in the banner was barren. By 1950, the original cultivated land was restored, and 25% was added. Of the 60,000 Mongolian and Han people who were forced to flee during the Kuomintang rule, more than 50,000 have returned home to production one after another. People's living standards have generally improved, and there are very few families who lack clothing and food. The people's lives in the new district banners are also gradually improving.

    Mongolian and Han People Move Towards Unity
    In the past, under the Kuomintang reactionaries' Han chauvinist policy of aggression, the contradictions between Mongolians and Han people were serious. In Etuoke Banner alone, more than 100 Mongolian and Han people have been killed in mutual killings since 1943. After liberation, the league people's government, in order to take care of the common interests of the Mongolian and Han people and reasonably resolve agricultural and pastoral contradictions, proposed the policy of "no closing of cultivated land, no opening of pasture land," and returned the land occupied by various provinces and counties in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Suiyuan to the Yimeng League to various banners. Now the Mongolian and Han people are beginning to move towards unity, and many areas have implemented mutual aid in production. Han people farm for Mongolians, and Mongolian livestock plow for Han people. The regulations restricting Han people from entering the pastoral areas have also been abolished. Before liberation, the area was often plagued by bandits. After liberation, the people's government, in order to relieve the people's suffering, concentrated the Mongolian and Han armed forces of the entire league, and cooperated with a certain cavalry division of the Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army. Under the policy of combining military suppression with political disintegration, the large groups of bandits in the entire league have been eliminated. In the bandit suppression, many vivid stories of love for the people emerged. A 60-year-old Mongolian man told the reporter with emotion: Last autumn, a class of a certain detachment of the Yimeng People's Army helped him harvest 20 mu of crops while suppressing bandits, without asking for any reward. The old man felt sorry, and this year during the Spring Festival, he gave two pounds of good milk, which he was reluctant to eat and prepared for the Genghis Khan Mausoleum sacrifice, to the People's Liberation Army living in the monastery. The old man held the reporter's hand tightly and said: "For 600 years since Genghis Khan, such a good team has never been seen on the grassland." Then he excitedly stretched out his thumb and said: "These are Chairman Mao's good soldiers!"

　　解放前后的鄂尔多斯草原
    ——纪念伊克昭盟解放一周年
    宏流
    春末夏初百草丛生的时候，记者踏进了鄂尔多斯草原（伊克昭盟）。该地拔海一千三百公尺，面积几占全绥远三分之一，全盟分为七旗一县两直属区，散居着近十万蒙民和二十五万汉人。蒙人多以游牧为生，汉人则从事农业生产。草原上风沙多，雨水少，不适于农作物生长；但遍地青草，却是优良的牧场。另外有闻名全国的马牙碱淖，和驰名西北的盐池，以及皮毛、甘草等产物。但这丰饶的鄂尔多斯草原，过去在国民党反动派大汉族主义血腥的统治下，变成了苦难无边的人间地狱！去年九月十九日伊盟全境获得解放（准噶尔旗于一九四八年解放），经一年建设，苦难的草原开始走向新生。
    满腔悲愤话当年
    抗战初期，蒋介石匪帮在伊盟境内，集中了大批特务，和近两万的匪军，一心要变鄂尔多斯草原为他们“防日反共的基地”（草原背靠陕甘宁边区，面临日寇统治的绥、包），匪徒们劫掠了各旗境内最肥沃的牧场约计在十万亩以上。一九四三年，陈匪长捷（任伊盟伪守备军总司令）又实行了武装“护垦”（军队强迫开垦）一直开到郡王旗王府附近，和札萨克旗的成陵禁地，（蒙古人民禁止开垦成吉思汉陵寝地）由于牧场缩小和瘟疫灾害，牲畜大量减少，如郡王旗一九四二年有牲畜十四万头，到一九四八年时只剩六万余头。继开垦牧场后，又设县代旗，推行保甲制，每年要向全旗人民勒索二、三十种苛捐杂税。准噶尔旗全年最多产粮十二万石，各项捐税要占八万石。蒙汉人民普遍以粗糠、瓜菜度日。匪徒们对于饥寒交迫的人民，压榨愈来愈残酷，一九四三年陈长捷匪军在乌、札两旗，烧毁了一半以上的召庙和民房，残杀了男女蒙民百余人，抢走无数财宝，在哈拉土庙将一家蒙民的财物全部抢光，还轮奸了一个十七岁的少女，并迫着女子的祖父奸自己的孙女。气得那位蒙民老汉仰天痛哭说：“国民党来了，草地上的人劫数到了”！
    英勇斗争求解放
    “数不清的星星，吹不完的沙；谁害死了我爹妈，玛脑特（即蒙语“我们”）不饶他。”这个民歌道出了草原人民对国民党反动派的痛恨和渴望解放的心情。
    一九三七年以后，草原上发生过不少次蒙古人民反抗国民党反动派的英勇斗争。其中以一九四三年的“伊盟事件”，为震动全国的一次大规模的反抗运动。那年三月二十六日札萨克旗军民，在沙王率领下，不分奴隶、喇嘛、王公和“太吉”（贵族），齐卷入了反陈匪的武装暴动，男女纷纷参加旗保安队，妇女们自动送茶送奶，杀牛宰羊慰劳军队，他们以少于敌人十倍的兵力，和没有一挺机枪的武装，血战两个月，歼灭陈匪军四百余人，缴获各式枪三十支，札旗军队伤亡仅七人。由于蒙古人民的英勇反抗，粉碎了蒋介石匪帮想借陈匪军消灭蒙古人民的阴谋。蒋匪武装镇压未遂，又施行“调停”阴谋，“调停”的结果，杀害了组织这次斗争的老赖连长，迫走指挥作战的旗保安司令鄂其尔巴士，气死了沙王。他临死还感激三边解放区（属陕甘宁边区）军民对他在困难中给予的同情和援助。蒙古人民普遍这样说：“要想草地变个样，还得找寻共产党”。乌审旗蒙民二百余人，组成了一支反抗国民党匪军的游击队，人数不断扩大，至一九四七年正式编为伊盟人民解放军二支队。七年来向国民党匪军进行过百次以上的大小战斗。并培养出大批优秀的蒙民干部。
    光明照在草地上
    “没有毛主席，那会有咱们的活路！”这已成了解放后草原上蒙汉人民共同的声音。
    解放较早的准噶尔旗蒙民白银门肯，辈辈当奴隶，他自己也过了三十多年的奴隶生活，解放后实行了减租，得到了土地、五石粮、二条牛，他过去啃草根，吃榆树皮，现在除了吃穿还能余粮三、四石。去年冬，他被选为出席全盟首届人民代表会议的代表，他兴奋地说：“在准旗像我这样翻了身的人还很多”。该旗在一九四八年夏天刚解放时，有三分之二以上的人家缺三四个月的口粮，旗人民政府立即从陕甘宁边区拨来救济粮一千石，又发动了减租和生产自救，两年来（从一九四八年至一九五○年）人口、土地、牲畜均有很大发展。一九四八年全旗每十户平均不到一头牲畜，到一九五○年每户平均一头还多。一九四八年全旗荒芜耕地百分之七十，到一九五○年恢复了原有耕地外，还增加了百分之二十五。在国民党统治时期，被迫逃亡的六万蒙汉人民，现已有五万多人陆续还家生产。人民生活普遍提高，少穿没吃的人家已经很少见了。新区各旗，人民生活也在逐步的改善。
    蒙汉人民走向团结
    过去在国民党反动派的大汉族主义侵略政策下，蒙汉矛盾严重，仅鄂托克旗从一九四三年以来，互相残杀致死的蒙汉人民即有一百余人。解放后盟人民政府为了照顾蒙汉人民共同利益，合理解决农牧矛盾，提出“耕地不闭，牧地不开”的方针，并将多年来陕、晋、绥各省县占去伊盟的土地，归还了各旗。现在蒙汉人民开始走向团结，不少地区并实行了变工互助生产，汉人给蒙人种地，蒙人的牲口给汉人耕地。在牧畜区也取消了限制汉人入境的规定。解放前该地常遭匪害，解放后人民政府为解除人民痛苦，集中全盟蒙汉武装，协同内蒙人民骑兵某师，在军事清剿结合政治瓦解的方针下，已将全盟境内大股匪徒肃清。在剿匪中出现了许多生动的爱民故事。一个六十岁的蒙民，感动的告诉记者：去年秋天，伊盟人民某支队的一个班，剿匪时还帮他收割了二十亩庄稼，不要任何报酬。老汉心里过意不去，在今年春节把自己舍不得吃准备祭成陵用的二斤好奶子，送给了住在召庙上的解放军。老汉紧紧拉着记者的手说：“成祖（成吉思汉）至今六百年，草地上没见过这样好的队伍。”接着他又兴奋地伸出了大姆指说：“这是毛主席的好兵啊！”
