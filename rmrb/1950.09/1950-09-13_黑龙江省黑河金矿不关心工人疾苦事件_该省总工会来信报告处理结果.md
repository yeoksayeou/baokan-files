　　Heilongjiang Province Heihe Gold Mine Ignores Workers' Suffering Incident
    The Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Reports on Handling Results
    Editor's Note: After this newspaper reprinted the Heilongjiang Daily's news item "Heihe Gold Mine Leaders Ignore Workers' Suffering" on page two on May 30, we received a reply letter from the Labor Protection Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions on September 2, reporting on the handling results of this incident. The original text of the reply letter is as follows:
    Comrade Editor: According to the reflections of the Provincial People's Congress and the inspection report of the Heihe Special Commissioner's Office, from March of last year to the end of May this year, a total of three workers were crushed to death, two were injured, one was disabled, one was hanged, and seven died of illness in the first branch and second mine of the Heihe Sub-bureau. The reason for this is mainly because the deputy mine manager, Li Duo, looked down on the workers and did not care about their lives and suffering. Administratively, Li has been given the punishment of dismissal from his post, and his candidacy for party membership has been revoked within the Party.
    Secondly, the leadership of the First Sub-bureau also had a bureaucratic style of work, only seeing that Deputy Mine Manager Li Duo was able to complete the task, but failing to check how he completed the task. Furthermore, they failed to correct Li Duo's wrong thoughts and actions in a timely manner. Therefore, it was decided to give the director of the bureau, Han Yunlong, a disciplinary warning.
      Labor Protection Department, Heilongjiang Provincial Federation of Trade Unions

　　黑龙江省黑河金矿不关心工人疾苦事件
    该省总工会来信报告处理结果
    编者按：本报五月三十日二版转载了黑龙江日报《黑河金矿领导不关心工人疾苦”的消息后，我们于九月二日接到了黑龙江省总工会劳保部的复信，报告对这个事件的处理结果。复信原文如下：
    编者同志：据省人代会的反映和黑河专署检查的报告，黑河一分局二分矿从去年三月到今年五月底，前后共砸死工人三人，砸伤二人，残废一人，吊死一人，病死七人。究其原因，主要是由于副矿长李多，眼睛向上，瞧不起工人，不关心工人的生命和疾苦。行政上已给李以撤职处分，党内并取消其候补党员资格。
    其次，一分局领导上也存在官僚主义作风，光看到李多副矿长能完成任务，而没检查他是怎样完成任务的。而对李多的错误思想和行动，亦未能及时予以纠正。因此决定给予该局长韩云龙以批评处分。
