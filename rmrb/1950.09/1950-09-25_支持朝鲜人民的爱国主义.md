　　The heroic Korean people are resolutely resisting the barbaric aggression of the American imperialists in order to defend their national independence. Despite the shameless howling of the American imperialists and their running dogs, the people of the world and the people of China are increasingly and enthusiastically sympathizing with the sacred patriotic war of the Korean people.
　　On September 18th, Austin, the United States representative to the United Nations, read MacArthur's report on the war of aggression against Korea at the United Nations Security Council, and groundlessly accused the People's Republic of China of sending "a large number of combat-hardened troops of Korean origin" to Korea. Our Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement on the 22nd, giving the American imperialist warmongers a stern reply. As our Foreign Ministry spokesman said: "Korean people residing in China have the legitimate right and sacred responsibility to return to defend their country and participate in the construction of their country. No country can find an excuse to interfere arbitrarily." Today, American imperialism, an industrial country with a population of over 146 million, is invading the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a nation that has been recently established and is struggling with construction. It has not only mobilized its own army, navy, and air force, with a force of over 100,000, but also forcibly mobilized the troops of many puppet countries, and even openly used Japanese soldiers who have been constantly bullying and enslaving the Korean people for the past 50 years and who surrendered in defeat in World War II without a peace treaty to participate in the war. Under these circumstances, American imperialism actually interferes with the Korean people residing in China returning to defend their country, and even accuses the People's Republic of China of sympathizing with the Korean people residing in China returning to defend their country. This is truly absurd and shameless.
　　The return of Korean people residing in China to their country to participate in the struggle to defend their country shows the rising tide of patriotism of the entire Korean people, and shows the determination of the entire Korean people to resist the crazy aggression of American imperialism. Korea and China are brotherly countries, and Korean culture is as ancient as Chinese culture. In the past fifty years, the Korean people have continuously engaged in heroic bloody struggles to resist the rule of Japanese aggressors. In the past thirty years, Korean people residing in China have continuously participated in the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary movement. Through long-term training, the outstanding Korean people have finally held high the banner of patriotism and resolutely opposed the crazy aggression of imperialism. Not only in Korea, but also among the oppressed and enslaved people of all nationalities in Asia, the tide of patriotism has risen. Encouraged by the great victory of the Chinese people and the heroic resistance of the Korean people, the people of Asia are no longer willing to endure the oppression and enslavement of European and American capitalist countries, and no longer willing to endure the aggression and bullying of European and American imperialism.
　　American imperialism, which is accustomed to distorting right and wrong, attempts to create a strange logic in world politics, which is: "I am right to oppose you, and you are guilty to oppose me." "I am right to help the traitorous and people-harming reactionaries, and you are guilty to help the people who defend their country." The American imperialist warmongers are constantly opposing the People's Republic of China, but they want to pretend that this is right and there is no crime of anti-China. Once they hear that the Chinese people are opposing American imperialism, they pretend to be confused and ask: Why do you oppose America? Why do the Chinese people oppose America? It is because American imperialism opposes the People's Republic of China. If you want to oppose China, I must oppose America. Reciprocity demands it. Why does American imperialism resolutely support Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the public enemy of the Chinese people? Why did American imperialism send a large fleet to invade China's territory and obstruct our liberation of Taiwan? Why does the American air force constantly invade our airspace, strafe and bomb our people? Why does American imperialism lead its puppet countries and still prevent our country from joining the United Nations? Why is American imperialism supporting Japanese fascist forces, rearming them, and plotting to expand the war of aggression? American imperialism has openly become the greatest enemy of the People's Republic of China. When this enemy is armed and invading our neighbors and friends, can we not support our neighbors and friends and oppose our enemies?
　　American imperialist warmongers think that the Chinese people are afraid of American accusations and threats. This is completely wrong. As our Foreign Ministry spokesman said: "The Chinese people neither accept such accusations nor fear such accusations." The Chinese people have always stood on the side of the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, resolutely striving for lasting world peace and opposing wars of aggression. The Chinese people should enthusiastically sympathize with and support the liberation of Korea, resolutely oppose the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea, invading our Taiwan, and intruding into the airspace of Northeast China, and resolutely oppose the conspiracy of American imperialism to expand the war.

### 支持朝鲜人民的爱国主义

　　支持朝鲜人民的爱国主义
    英勇的朝鲜人民为了保卫自己的祖国独立，正在坚决抵抗最野蛮的美帝国主义的侵略。尽管美帝国主义者及其走狗如何无耻地狂吠，全世界人民和全中国人民却愈来愈热烈地同情着朝鲜人民的神圣爱国战争。
    九月十八日，美国驻联合国代表奥斯汀在联合国安全理事会宣读麦克阿瑟关于侵略朝鲜战争的报告，妄行指责中华人民共和国向朝鲜送出“大批原籍朝鲜的久经战斗的军队”之后，我国外交部发言人于二十二日发表声明，给了美帝国主义战争贩子一个严正的回答。诚如我国外交部发言人所说：“居留中国境内的朝鲜人民，回去保卫自己的祖国，参加祖国的建设事业，这是他们的正当权利和神圣责任，任何国家都找不到借口可以妄加干涉。”今天，美帝国主义以拥有一万四千六百多万人口的工业国家，侵略缔造未久、建设维艰的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。不但出动了自己的陆、海、空军，人数达十万以上，同时，还强迫动员了许多仆从国家的军队，甚且公开利用五十年来不断欺凌和奴役朝鲜人民和在世界第二次大战中失败投降尚未缔结和约的日本的军人参加作战。在这种情况之下，美帝国主义居然来干涉居留中国的朝鲜人民回去保卫祖国，居然指责中华人民共和国同情居留中国的朝鲜人民回去保卫祖国，真正是荒谬绝伦，不知羞耻。
    居留中国的朝鲜人民之回到祖国，参加保卫祖国的斗争，就是表明整个朝鲜人民爱国主义的高涨，就是表明整个朝鲜人民决心反抗美帝国主义的疯狂侵略。朝鲜与中国是兄弟之邦，朝鲜的文化与中国的文化同样悠久。朝鲜人民在过去五十年中，为了反抗日本侵略者的统治，曾不断进行流血的英勇斗争。居留中国的朝鲜人民，在过去三十年中曾不断参加中国人民反帝反封建的革命运动。由于长期的锻炼，优秀的朝鲜人民终于高举爱国主义的旗帜，坚决反对帝国主义的疯狂侵略。不但在朝鲜如此，在整个亚洲被压迫被奴役的各民族人民中，爱国主义的怒潮都已高涨起来了。在中国人民伟大胜利、朝鲜人民英勇抵抗的鼓舞之下，亚洲人民再也不愿忍受欧美资本主义国家的压迫与奴役，再也不愿忍受欧美帝国主义的侵略与欺凌了。
    惯于颠倒是非的美帝国主义，企图在世界政治中造成一种奇怪的逻辑，这就是：“我反对你有理，你反对我有罪。”“我帮助卖国残民的反动派有理，你帮助保卫祖国的人民有罪。”美帝国主义战争贩子，无时无刻不在反对中华人民共和国，但是他们要装作这是应该的，没有反华的罪名。一旦听见中国人民反对美帝国主义，就假糊涂似的问：你为什么反美？中国人民为什么要反美呢？就是由于美帝国主义反对中华人民共和国，你要反华，我就必需反美，礼尚往来。美帝国主义为什么坚决支持中国人民公敌蒋介石匪帮呢？美帝国主义为什么派遣庞大的舰队，侵入中国的领土，阻碍我国解放台湾呢？美帝国主义的空军为什么不断侵袭我国领空，扫射与轰炸我国人民呢？美帝国主义为什么率领它的仆从国家，至今不让我国加入联合国呢？美帝国主义为什么扶植日本法西斯势力，加以重新武装，阴谋扩大侵略战争呢？美帝国主义已经公开地成为中华人民共和国的最大仇敌。当这个敌人武装侵略我们的邻人和友人的时候，难道我们能够不声援自己的邻人和友人，而反对自己的敌人吗？
    美帝国主义战争贩子，以为中国人民害怕美国的指责和威吓，这是完全想错了。正如我外交部发言人所说：“中国人民既不接受这种指责，也不畏惧这种指责。”中国人民从来是站在以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营方面，坚决争取全世界持久和平，反对侵略战争的。中国人民应当热烈同情和支持朝鲜解放，应当坚决反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜、侵略我国的台湾和侵入东北领空的罪行，坚决反对美帝国主义扩大战争的阴谋。
