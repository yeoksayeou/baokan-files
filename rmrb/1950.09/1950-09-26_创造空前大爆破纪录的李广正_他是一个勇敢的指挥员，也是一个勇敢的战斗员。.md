　　Li Guangzheng, Creator of an Unprecedented Blasting Record
    He is a brave commander and a brave fighter.
    Li Guangzheng is the deputy company commander of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army. During the Liberation War, in the Northeast and North China battlefields, and in the major battles that determined the war situation, he was awarded one special merit, four major merits, and two minor merits. He attended the First National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League with the lofty honor of a people's hero. He is a brave commander and also a brave fighter.
    In 1947, during the Northeast Field Army's summer offensive, on the second night of the Siping offensive, he led his squad to complete twelve major blasts. At that time, Comrade Li Guangzheng was the deputy squad leader of the eighth squad of the first company. When the higher-ups decided to eliminate the enemy's 263rd regiment entrenched in the pseudo-court's Great Red Building, he volunteered to take on the blasting mission.
    During the day, he braved the fierce enemy fire to blow down a brick wall blocking the assault route. As soon as it got dark, he blasted open the barbed wire and carried explosives to carry out two consecutive blasts, blowing a gap in the Great Red Building. The assault team rushed into the Great Red Building, and many comrades were sacrificed and seriously injured. Li Guangzheng angrily swore: "I will destroy the Great Red Building even if I die, to avenge my comrades!" He continued to blast once more, but the enemy stubbornly held on. When he carried fifty or sixty pounds of explosives for the fourth blast, he was stunned and covered in bricks. When he regained consciousness, he remembered that his mission was not yet completed, so he crawled back and said to the instructor: "Our eighth squad must complete the mission." The instructor advised him to rest. But he carried the explosives again and led the eighth squad to carry out five consecutive blasts. At this time, two more comrades in the squad were injured. Li Guangzheng and the remaining two comrades were determined: "As long as there is one person in the eighth squad, the blasting mission will definitely be completed." From night to dawn, Li Guangzheng traveled back and forth twenty-four times under enemy fire, using more than two thousand pounds of explosives, and carried out twelve consecutive blasts, finally blasting half of a two-to-three-hundred-meter-long, three-story Great Red Building. He was the first to rush upstairs, captured the enemy's deputy regiment commander alive, and annihilated an entire enemy regiment. He created an unprecedented blasting record in our army's history.
    During the Jinzhou campaign, Li Guangzheng led the second platoon straight into the depths of the old city. Midway, the deputy company commander was seriously injured, and the instructor announced that Li Guangzheng would act as the company commander. He led the entire company, fighting from the southeast corner of the old city to the northwest corner, annihilating more than 400 enemies and capturing twenty-seven "Type 97" anti-tank guns.
    Before the general attack in the Tianjin battle, Li Guangzheng led a platoon to monitor the enemy. One day, the enemy suddenly launched a fierce attack and bombarded our position with a large number of shells. Two sentry posts were sacrificed in their positions, and the situation was very critical. The regiment headquarters instructed to hold the position, and Li Guangzheng immediately replied firmly: "We will definitely hold the position and not lose an inch of ground!" Two enemy companies repeatedly attacked our army. When the grenades ran out, he ordered the use of explosive tubes to counterattack the enemy. When the enemy launched their ninth attack, Li Guangzheng jumped out, and his shoulder was pierced by a bullet. But he immediately realized that this was a critical moment. Although his uniform was stained with blood, he continued to stand up and command the battle. When the regimental leader called to inquire about the situation on the position, he firmly replied: "As long as I am here, the position is here!" The regimental party committee immediately announced that Li Guangzheng would be awarded a major merit on the front line. (Attached picture)

　　创造空前大爆破纪录的李广正
    他是一个勇敢的指挥员，也是一个勇敢的战斗员。
    李广正是人民解放军第四野战军某部副连长，在解放战争中，在东北、华北战场，在决定战局的各重大战斗中，他立了一特功、四大功、二小功。他带着崇高的人民英雄的荣誉，出席过全国新民主主义青年团第一次代表大会。他是一个勇敢的指挥员，也是一个勇敢的战斗员。
    一九四七年，在东北我军夏季攻势中，四平攻坚战的第二天晚上，他领导本班战士完成了十二次大爆破。那时李广正同志是一连八班副，当上级决定要消灭龟缩在伪法院大红楼中的敌二六三团时，他自动要求担任爆破任务。
    白天他冒着炽烈的敌火，炸倒横在冲锋路上的一堵砖墙，天一黑爆破开铁丝网，他就抱起炸药连续进行两次爆破，把大红楼炸开一个缺口，突击队冲进大红楼，不少同志牺牲和负了重伤，李广正气愤的宣誓：“我死也得炸毁大红楼，为同志们报仇！”他又继续爆破了一次，但敌人顽强的据守着。当他背了五、六十斤重的炸药进行第四次爆破时，他被震昏过去，砖头砸了他满身。当他稍一苏醒，想起自己任务尚未完成，他就爬回来向指导员说：“我们八班还要完成任务。”指导员劝他休息。但他又抱起炸药带领八班战士连续进行了五次爆破。此时班里又有两个同志负伤。李广正和剩下的两个同志下决心：“只要八班有一个人在，爆破任务一定完成。”这样从黑夜到天明，李广正在敌人炮火封锁下往返二十四次，用了两千多斤炸药，连续爆破十二次，终于把一座二、三百米长的三层大红楼炸塌一半。他第一个冲上楼去，生俘敌副团长，歼灭了敌人一个整团。创造了我军战史上空前的大爆破纪录。
    在锦州战役时，李广正带领二排向旧城纵深直插进去，中途副连长负了重伤，指导员宣布由李广正代理连长。他领着全连，从旧城东南角一直打到西北角，共歼敌四百余，缴获二十七门“九七”战防炮。
    天津战斗总攻前，李广正带领一个排监视敌人。有一天敌人突然猛扑过来，并以大量炮弹，向我阵地猛击，二个监视哨牺牲在岗位上，情况十分危急。团部指示要坚守阵地，李广正立即坚决回答：“我们一定守住阵地，寸土不失！”敌人两个连一次又一次的向我军猛扑。手榴弹打光了，他就命令用爆破筒回击敌人。当敌人第九次猛扑过来，李广正一跃身冲出去，他的肩部就被子弹打穿了，但他马上意识到这是万分紧急的关头，虽然军衣沾满了鲜血，仍然挺身继续指挥作战。当团首长来电话询问阵地情况时，他坚决答道：“有我就有阵地！”团党委即时宣布给李广正火线记大功一次。（附图片）
