Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th. This year, the Northeast region has made great achievements in farmland water conservancy construction. This year, the region has invested in the construction of 41 irrigation projects, completing more than 2.77 million cubic meters of earthwork for canals and building 1,752 various large buildings such as闸门(sluice gates) and涵洞(culverts). In addition, there are many irrigation projects run by the counties themselves. Statistics show that the region has restored irrigation and added more than 500,000 mu of paddy fields this year. The rice in these benefited farmlands is currently growing very well, with an average yield of 530 jin per mu, which will exceed the planned yield by 15 percent.

The irrigation projects in Northeast China were severely damaged when the Japanese invaders surrendered, leaving nearly 2 million mu of paddy fields barren. After liberation, the People's Government invested in repairs year after year. In the past two years alone, the investment in grain has reached more than 113,000 tons. Up to now, most of the small and medium-sized irrigation areas have been restored and exceeded the pre-war irrigation area. This year, the People's Government focused on investing in the construction of four large irrigation area projects, such as the Panjin Farm in western Liaoning. Except for the 前郭旗(Qian Gorlos Mongolian Autonomous County) irrigation area, which will be constructed this autumn, the rest have completed a total of 2,741 large and small buildings, and 2.42 million cubic meters of earthwork. This year, 287,000 mu of land have been irrigated. After the completion of the entire project, a total of 1.46 million mu of cultivated land can be irrigated.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 17th. In the Suide Special District of northern Shaanxi Province, agricultural production has been restored and developed rapidly this year thanks to the efforts of farmers to organize themselves. Suide, Yanchuan, Mizhi and other eight counties in the special district suffered extremely heavy damage from the Chiang Kai-shek-Hu Zongnan bandit army during the War of Liberation. However, after two years of efforts by the People's Government to lead the farmers, the wounds of war have gradually healed, and the economic situation has basically improved. For example, after the farmers in Sunjiagou, Mizhi County, organized labor exchange and mutual assistance this year, the average grain income per person increased by 60 percent compared with last year. About one-third of the farmers in the special district have organized labor exchange and mutual assistance, with nearly 40,000 laborers participating in the labor exchange groups, and a total of more than 227,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed this year. In Suide, Mizhi and other counties with less wasteland, the farmers have invested the labor force saved after organizing labor exchange into transportation and other sideline production, which has also greatly increased the income of the farmers.

After the farmers' income increased, in addition to expanding production, they are now actively running schools and building righteous granaries for disaster prevention. Many farmers in Suide collectively plant cotton in units of labor exchange groups this year, and most of them plan to sell cotton and buy grass to solve the problem of fertilizer shortage. Xiwu Village, Zizhou County (newly established county, formerly western Suide), plans to use the income from the collective reclamation of wasteland this year to start a winter school. Farmers in Zichang County (formerly Anding County) collectively opened more than 400 mu of righteous granary fields this year, and 18 righteous granaries can be established after autumn.

　　东北农田水利建设成绩巨大
    全区受益农田共五十余万亩
    陕西绥德专区农民组织变工互助迅速恢复生产
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】东北地区今年在农田水利建设上有很大的成就。全区今年以国家投资兴修的灌溉工程共四十一处，计完成渠道土工二百七十七万余公方，修建闸门、涵洞等各种较大建筑物一千七百五十二座。此外，各县自办的灌溉工程也不少。统计全区今年恢复灌溉和新增的水田共五十余万亩，这些受益农田的水稻，目前生长情况均极良好，每亩平均产量可达五百三十斤，将超过计划产量百分之十五。
    东北各地灌溉工程，在日寇投降时曾遭严重破坏，使将近二百万亩的水田陷于荒芜。解放后，人民政府即连年投资修复。仅去年和今年两年中投资粮食达十一万三千余吨。截至现在止，各中小灌溉区大部均已恢复和超过战前的灌溉面积。今年人民政府重点投资兴修的辽西盘山农场等四处大型灌区工程，除前郭旗灌区于今秋施工外，其余共已完成了大小建筑物二千七百四十一座，土方工程二百四十二万余公方，今年灌田已达二十八万七千亩。全部工程计划完成后，共可灌溉一百四十六万亩耕地。
    【新华社西安十七日电】陕西省北部绥德专区，在农民组织起来的努力下，今年农业生产的恢复和发展很快。该专区绥德、延川、米脂等八县在解放战争中，遭受蒋胡（宗南）匪军的破坏极重，但经人民政府领导农民两年的努力，战争创伤已渐平复，经济情况基本上已好转。如米脂县孙家沟农民今年组织变工互助后，每人平均粮食收入，就比去年增加了百分之六十。该专区农民已组织变工互助的约三分之一，参加变工组的劳动力近四万人，今年共开荒二十二万七千多亩。荒地较少的绥德、米脂等县，农民就将组织变工后省出的劳动力投入运输等副业生产，也使农民的收入有很大的增加。
    农民收入增加后，他们除扩大生产外，现在正纷纷举办学校和防荒的义仓。绥德农民今年以变工组为单位集体种棉的很多，他们大多准备卖棉买草，解决缺肥困难。子洲县（新设县，原绥德西部）西坞村准备把今年集体开荒的收入开办冬学。子长县（原安定县）农民今年特别集体开了四百多亩义仓田，秋后即可成立义仓十八处。
