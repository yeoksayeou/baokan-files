　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: The American troops invading Korea, who have retreated to the seaside, are still performing scandalous and debauched farces on the last piece of Korean land they occupy. According to an International News Service dispatch from Busan on the 13th: Busan, a city that is almost on the front line, is full of armed men. Batches of soldiers, sailors, and marines flow endlessly through the crowded streets. The military police find their most difficult task is dispersing the frequent brawls. These brawls often erupt when an American soldier tries to snatch another American soldier's Korean dance partner, leading to verbal abuse. INS quoted military police as saying: "The most violent fights have occurred in the uncontrolled areas of Busan – 'Little Chicago'. We had to deploy eight armored vehicles with machine guns mounted to break up a gunfight duel."

　　釜山美军荒淫无耻
    经常发生凶狠的械斗
    【新华社十五日讯】已经溃退到海边的侵朝美军，在他们所盘据的最后一块朝鲜土地上，仍在表演着荒淫无耻的丑剧。据国际新闻社釜山十三日电：釜山这个已经差不多是前线的城市，充满着荷枪的人。一批一批的士兵、水手和海军陆战队，在拥挤的街道上川流不息地走着。宪兵感到最棘手的工作是驱散经常发生的械斗。这种械斗每每发生在一个美国大兵想把另一个美国大兵的朝鲜舞伴夺过来而破口大骂的时候。国新社引宪兵的话称：“在釜山不受管制的地区——‘小芝加哥’，发生过最凶的殴斗。我们不得不驶出八辆架好机关枪的装甲车去驱散那场开枪的决斗。”
