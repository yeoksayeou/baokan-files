　　Against the Unreasonable Atrocity of the US Air Force in Shooting Down a Soviet Aircraft
    Korean People Express Anger and Protest
    "Rodong Sinmun" Points Out that American War Adventurers Cannot Evade Responsibility Before Progressive Humanity
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th] The unreasonable atrocity of the US imperialist air force in shooting down a Soviet aircraft within the boundaries of Lushun Port on September 4th has aroused anger and protest from Korean opinion circles and people from all walks of life. "Rodong Sinmun" published an editorial on the 9th entitled "American War Adventurers Cannot Evade Responsibility Before Progressive Humanity," stating: The provocative act of the US imperialist air force in shooting down a Soviet aircraft is consistent with its plot to expand the war. This atrocity of the US imperialists, together with their armed intervention in Korea and the crimes of invading the airspace of the People's Republic of China, destroying peaceful facilities, and killing and wounding innocent people, clearly proves that the essence of the US "overall diplomacy" lies in seeking world hegemony and constantly creating new provocative incidents. However, the provocations of the US imperialists are bound to be severely attacked by the awakened people of the world who have already united. The editorial pointed out: The September 4th incident occurred within the boundaries of Lushun Port. Although the US imperialist bandits stubbornly linked this incident to the Korean military operations, attempting to create the impression that the Soviet Union had participated in the Korean military operations, the American war adventurers cannot evade responsibility for their provocative crimes before progressive humanity. The editorial emphasized: The Korean people fully support the Soviet government's note to the US government demanding accountability for the incident, considering it a legitimate measure to strive for lasting world peace and human security.
    Han Sol-ya, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of World Peace, Choe Gyeong-deok, Chairman of the North Korean Federation of Trade Unions, Hyeon Jeong-min, Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Youth League, and Park Jeong-ae, Chairman of the North Korean Democratic Women's League, also issued protest statements successively.

　　对美空军无理击落苏机暴行
    朝鲜人民表示愤怒抗议
    “劳动新闻”指出美国战争冒险家  无法在进步人类面前回避责任
    【新华社平壤十二日电】九月四日，美帝国主义空军在旅顺港境内击落苏联飞机的无理暴行，激起了朝鲜舆论界和各界人士的愤怒与抗议。“劳动新闻”九日以“美国战争冒险家无法在进步人类面前回避责任”为题发表社论称：美帝国主义者的空军击落苏联飞机的挑衅行为，和它企图扩大战争的阴谋是一致的。美帝国主义者这一暴行，与其武装干涉朝鲜及侵犯中华人民共和国领空、破坏和平设施、杀伤无辜人民的罪恶行为，清楚地证明了美国“总体外交”的本质在于称霸世界，不断地制造新的挑拨事件。但是美帝国主义者的挑衅，一定要遭到全世界已经团结起来的觉悟了的人民的沉重打击。社论指出：九月四日的事件发生在旅顺港的境界内，美帝国主义强盗虽硬把这一事件联系到朝鲜的军事行动，妄图造成一种苏联已参加了朝鲜军事行动的印象，然而美国战争冒险家们是无法在进步人类面前回避其挑衅罪行的责任的。社论强调称：朝鲜人民完全支持苏联政府致美国政府追究事件责任的照会，认为它是争取世界持久和平与人类安全的正当措施。
    朝鲜拥护世界和平全国委员会委员长韩雪野、北朝鲜职业总同盟委员长崔璟德、北朝鲜民主青年同盟委员长玄正民、北朝鲜民主妇女同盟委员长朴正爱，也先后发表了抗议声明。
