Let's Run the Radio University Well
    Wen Jize

The Radio University I'm talking about here refers to the social science lectures of the Central People's Broadcasting Station.

To help listeners in various regions study Marxist-Leninist theory, the Central People's Broadcasting Station added social science lectures starting from April 10th this year. The content of this lecture is divided into two parts: one part is explaining "Cadre's Must-Read," and the other part is about Chinese revolution issues and relatively simple social science knowledge. Currently, only the first part of the lecture has started.

We have already held two lectures, namely: Comrade Ai Siqi's "History of Social Development," and Comrades Yu Guangyuan and Wang Huide's "Political Economy." The History of Social Development lecture covered issues such as from ape to man, five modes of production, socialist revolution and new democratic revolution, politics and the state, and social ideology. Including answering listeners' questions, it was lectured a total of twenty-three times, and was completed at the end of June. From July, according to the requests of many local listeners, we are inviting Comrade Ai Siqi to lecture a second time. The Political Economy lecture explains important and difficult issues in V. Leontief's "Political Economy," and including answering listeners' questions, it was lectured a total of twenty-seven times, and was completed on September 7th. From October 4th, Professor Guo Dali will be invited to broadcast "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," and we also plan to start broadcasting "On New Democracy" and "State and Revolution" this year.

As of September 7th, a total of 471 units, including various agencies, organizations, and schools, across twenty-three provinces, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Shenyang, Xi'an, Hankou, and Chongqing, have organized listening and are directly in contact with the Central People's Broadcasting Station. Some of these units actually represent many agencies and organizations. For example, the Zhangjiakou People's Broadcasting Station represents dozens of agencies and organizations in Chahar Province in unified contact with the Central People's Broadcasting Station. According to statistics from 297 units, the number of listeners is approximately 86,000. Among the listeners, the vast majority are cadres from CCP committees and agencies, followed by cadres from government and PLA units, and also some students and a small number of professors and teachers. In addition to organized listeners, more than 50 individual listeners have contacted the radio station, including students, professors, teachers, doctors, cultural center staff, citizens, housewives, and even a few people recovering in sanatoriums. This statistic is incomplete. For example, we know that many people in Kunming, Guilin, and other places are listening, but they have not yet contacted the radio station. In terms of the large number of listeners and the wide distribution area, it is fitting for us to call this radio lecture a Radio University. In Eastern European New Democratic countries, such as Hungary, there is a Free Radio University, and in Poland, there is a People's Radio University. Although our lecture does not have such a name, it is essentially a Radio University.

Five months of broadcasting have yielded considerable gains. In the past, many places could not find teachers, and they did not fully understand the books they read themselves, so their studies were never successful. Some agencies had studied the history of social development or political economy, but some problems could not be solved, so they dragged on for a long time and still had not finished studying. This time, listening to the broadcast solved many difficulties. More than two months of experience have proven that broadcasting is one of the effective tools to help cadres study. It can not only help many places solve the difficulty of not having teachers and not understanding books, but also become an organizer of learning, making everyone have to listen on time. If one can listen on time, one will definitely be able to complete the study plan within the prescribed period. At the end of June, when we summarized the study of the history of social development, we asked the study units what achievements and experiences they had gained. Many units replied that the gains from this study were greater than in previous studies. For example, the Yingkou Municipal People's Government study group said: "Every comrade's thinking has made significant progress." Another example is the Shanghai Putuo District People's Government study group said: "Generally speaking, after this study, comrades have been able to establish a labor perspective and strengthen their understanding of the greatness of the masses' power." The Xingtai Prefectural Supply and Marketing Cooperative and other study groups said: "Problems that could not be solved in previous studies have been solved this time, and many confused ideas in thought have also been clarified this time." The Chahar Daily study group also held an exam after completing the study, with an average score of over seventy points.

The main experience in organizing listening is: listening and learning must have leadership and organization. For example, the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the North China Military Region issued a notice at the beginning of the lecture, stipulating specific methods, organizing cadres from directly affiliated agencies and agencies above the provincial military region to listen. Many agencies organized listening groups, and many groups formulated strict learning discipline, such as not being absent without reason, not being late, etc. Some responsible comrades of the CCP county committees attached great importance to listening to the broadcast, personally leading and taking the lead in learning. The faculty and staff study group of Baoding Women's Middle School was personally led by the principal to preview, listen to the broadcast, and discuss. The Chahar Daily formulated a relatively complete system for listening and learning, such as group learning, holding regular discussion meetings, group leaders meeting once a week to report on the learning situation of the week and discuss the issues that should be paid attention to in the next week, etc., and finally held a test. There are many groups like this. These groups have gained considerable gains from listening and learning. At the end of June, when the lecture on the history of social development was completed, we conducted a survey. According to incomplete statistics, from the filled-in forms, a total of 11,694 people persisted in listening from beginning to end, and they all learned quite well. However, on the other hand, there are also many units where learning is laissez-faire. At the beginning, there were many people listening, but later the number gradually decreased, and even no one listened. Although some of these people have a lower theoretical level and are not suitable for reading "Cadre's Must-Read" immediately, the main reason why most people cannot persist in listening is still due to the lack of leadership and organization. The CCP Yanqing County Committee in Chahar Province has a very good experience: at first, the leadership did not attach importance to learning and listening to the broadcast, thinking that it was "unacceptable" and did not organize listening. Later, the prefectural committee convened a broadcast meeting, pointing out that Yanqing County Committee's failure to attach importance to learning and organize cadres to listen to social science lectures was wrong, and gave a circular criticism. After reviewing, the Yanqing County Committee began to attach importance to listening to the broadcast, dividing more than 200 cadres into several groups according to their cultural and theoretical level, with more than 80 people listening to the history of social development, more than 10 people listening to political economy, and the rest learning culture, and stipulating the time and methods of learning separately, with the responsible comrades personally leading and listening on time. As a result, the cadres' learning was carried out in a standardized manner. From this example, we can see that: only with leadership and organization can we learn well.

Therefore, we would like to make a few hopes and requirements to the listening units, that is: those who have not done a good job in organization and leadership should find ways to improve in the future. Those who have not yet contacted the radio station should quickly establish regular contact with the Central People's Broadcasting Station or the local People's Broadcasting Station, and frequently give opinions and ask questions, so that we can improve the broadcasting work according to everyone's opinions. We believe that only when everyone is organized can we run this radio university well and make broadcasting a truly effective tool to help cadres learn.

### 大家来办好广播大学

　　大家来办好广播大学
    温济泽
    这里所说的广播大学，是说的中央人民广播电台的社会科学讲座。
    中央人民广播电台为了帮助各地听众学习马列主义理论，从今年四月十日起，增设了社会科学讲座。这个讲座的内容分两部分：一部分是讲解《干部必读》，一部分是讲中国革命问题和较浅近的社会科学知识。现在只开始办了前一部分讲座。
    我们已经办了两个讲座，就是：艾思奇同志讲的《社会发展史》，和于光远、王惠德同志讲的《政治经济学》。社会发展史讲座讲了从猿到人、五种生产方式、社会主义革命和新民主主义革命、政治与国家、社会思想意识等问题，连解答听众问题，一共讲二十三次，已经在六月底讲完。从七月起，根据许多地方听众的要求，正在请艾思奇同志讲第二遍。政治经济学讲座是讲解列昂节夫著《政治经济学》一书中的重要的难懂的问题，连解答听众问题，一共讲了二十七次，已经在九月七日讲完。从十月四日起，将请郭大力教授播讲《帝国主义论》，在今年内还准备开始播讲《新民主主义论》，和《国家与革命》。
    各地机关、团体、学校等组织收听并和中央人民广播电台直接联系的，到九月七日为止，一共有四七一单位。分布在二十三省，内蒙自治区和北京、天津、上海、南京、沈阳、西安、汉口、重庆等市。其中有些单位实际上是代表很多机关团体，例如张家口人民广播电台，它就是代表了察哈尔省的几十个机关团体统一和中央人民广播电台联系的。收听的人数，根据二九七单位的统计，共约八万六千人。在听众中，绝大部分是中共党委机关干部，其次是政府和解放军部队机关干部，也有一部分学生和少数教授、教员等。除去有组织的听众外，个别听者和电台联系的有五十多人，其中有学生、教授教员、医师、文化馆职员、市民、家庭妇女，还有几个在疗养院里养病的人。这个统计是不完全的，例如，据我们所知，昆明、桂林等地就有不少人收听，但现在还没有和电台联系。以听众人数之多和分布地区之广来说，我们把这个广播讲座叫做广播大学是名副其实的。在东欧新民主主义国家，如匈牙利有自由广播大学，波兰有人民广播大学，我们的讲座虽然没有这样的名称，但实质上已经是一所广播大学了。
    五个月的广播有相当大的收获。许多地方过去因为请不到教员，自己看书又不完全懂，所以学习始终搞不好；有些机关曾经学过社会发展史或政治经济学，但有些问题解决不了，因而拖拖拉拉，学了很久，还没有学完。这次收听广播，解决了不少困难。两个多月的经验证明，广播是帮助干部学习的有效工具之一。它不但可以帮助许多地方解决没有教员和读不懂书的困难，而且可以成为学习的组织者，使大家必须按时收听，如果能做到按时收听，就一定能在规定的时期内完成学习计划。六月底我们总结社会发展史的学习时，曾问各学习单位有些什么成绩和心得，不少单位回信说，这次学习比以往学习的收获大。例如营口市人民政府学习小组说：“每个同志思想都有了显著的进步。”又如上海普陀区人民政府学习小组说：“一般同志经过此次学习，均能建立起劳动观点，加强认识了群众力量的伟大。”邢台专区供销合作社等学习小组说：“以前在学习中不能解决的问题，这次解决了，思想上有很多糊涂观念，这次也搞清楚了。”察哈尔日报社学习小组在学完后并举行了考试，平均分数在七十分以上。
    在组织收听方面的主要经验是：收听学习必须有领导，有组织。例如华北军区政治部宣传部在讲座开始时，就发出通知，规定了具体的办法，组织直属机关和所属省军区以上各机关干部收听，许多机关都组织了收听小组，许多小组都订出了严格的学习纪律，如不得无故缺席，不得迟到等；中共有些县委负责同志对收听广播十分重视，亲自领导，带头学习；保定女中的教职员学习小组由校长亲自领导大家预习、听广播和讨论；察哈尔日报社对收听学习规定了一套比较完整的制度，如分组学习、定期开讨论会、每星期各小组长接头一次，汇报本周学习情况并讨论下周学习应注意的事项等，最后还举行测验。像这样的小组还有不少。这些小组收听学习都有相当大的收获。在六月底社会发展史讲完的时候，我们做了一次调查，据不完全统计，从填来的表上看，从头到尾坚持收听的共有一一六九四人，他们都学得相当好。但另一方面，也有不少单位，学习是自流的，开始的时候听的人多，以后逐渐减少，甚至没有人听了。这其中虽然有一部分人是因为理论水平较低，不适宜马上读《干部必读》，但多数人不能坚持收听的主要原因，还是由于没有领导，没有组织。中共察哈尔省延庆县委有一个很好的经验：起初，领导方面不重视学习，不重视收听广播，认为“接受不了”，不组织收听，以后地委召开了广播会议，指出延庆县委不重视学习、不组织干部收听社会科学讲座是错误的，给予了通报批评，延庆县委在检讨后，对收听广播开始重视起来，把两百多干部按文化理论水平分成了若干组，其中有八十多人收听社会发展史，十多人收听政治经济学，其余的人学文化，并分别规定了学习的时间和办法，由负责同志亲自领导，按时收听，结果干部学习正规地进行起来了。从这个例子，可以看出：必须有领导，有组织，才能学得好。
    因此，我们对各收听单位提出一点希望和要求，就是：组织和领导工作还没有做好的，今后要设法改进。还没有和广播电台联系的，快些和中央人民广播电台或当地人民广播电台建立经常的联系，经常提意见，提问题，使我们可以根据大家的意见，改进播讲工作。我们认为，只有大家组织起来，才能把这个广播大学办好，才能使广播成为帮助干部学习的真正有效的一个工具。
