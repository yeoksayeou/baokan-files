　　Central South Region Native Produce Conference Determines Future Policy
    Decides to Vigorously Organize Private Merchant Purchasing and Sales
    [Hankou News] According to the Yangtze River Daily, the Central South Region Company of the China Native Produce Company held a joint conference of provincial and municipal company managers from August 16th to August 28th to review past work and determine future policies. The conference unanimously agreed that vigorously purchasing and selling native produce is an important link in promoting the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production. Solving the sales problem of native produce can gradually increase the purchasing power of farmers, and also open up a broad market for urban industrial products. Therefore, it was decided that the business policy of the native produce company is: to carry out the purchase and sale of raw products, vigorously organize the export and domestic sales of native products, so as to promote the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and achieve the purpose of industrial and agricultural recovery and development. It should also unite private merchants to purchase and sell native products to facilitate the exchange of materials. At the same time, the policy of free inland trade must be implemented to encourage private merchants to go to the countryside for purchasing. In terms of native produce promotion, it was determined that native produce companies should focus more on wholesale in the future, while retail should be left to private merchants. In terms of business methods, public-private joint purchase, joint sales, and joint transportation can be tried.

　　中南区土产会议确定今后方针
    决定大力组织私商购销
    【汉口讯】据长江日报消息：中国土产公司中南区公司在八月十六日至八月二十八日曾召开全区省、市公司经理联席会议，检讨过去工作，确定今后方针。会议一致认为大力购销土产，是促进工农业生产的恢复与发展的一个重要环节。解决了土产销路问题，就可逐步提高农民的购买力，同时也为城市工业品开辟了广阔的市场。因此，决定土产公司经营方针是：开展生产品的购销工作，大力组织土产品的出口与内销，以促进城乡内外物资交流，达到工农业恢复与发展的目的。并应团结私商购销土产，以利物资交流。同时必须贯彻内地贸易自由政策，鼓励私商下乡收购。而在土产推销方面，确定了土产公司今后应多着重批发，零售则让给私商经营。经营的方式，可试行公私联购、联销和联运的办法。
