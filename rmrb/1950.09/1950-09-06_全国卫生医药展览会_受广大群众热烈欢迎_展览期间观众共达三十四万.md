　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The first National Health and Pharmaceutical Exhibition was held in Beijing for 25 days and was warmly welcomed by the masses. It closed on August 30th. The exhibition was attended by 340,000 people, including the general public from Beijing and Tianjin, as well as surrounding counties and towns, and organized groups from over 600 units, including schools, factories, and rural areas. In addition, visiting groups were organized from Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Jinan, Qingdao, Shanghai, Hubei, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places to visit Beijing from afar.

　　The exhibition used pictures, models, objects, tables, and written explanations to illustrate that "prevention first" is the correct guiding principle for current health work. The exhibition showed that under the reactionary rule of old China, the broad masses of people were mired in disease for a long time. Due to the inability to develop medicine and science at that time, and the prevalence of feudal superstitious medical methods, people died in large numbers. In New China, the People's Government leads the broad masses of people to fight against disease and has achieved considerable success. The exhibition focused on introducing the experience of preventing and controlling infectious diseases in various regions. For example, in the Northeast, there were 30,326 plague patients in 1947, which was reduced to 445 in 1949. The exhibition provided vivid and concrete introductions to the prevention and control methods of various infectious diseases, common diseases (such as trachoma), and endemic diseases. The exhibition also introduced the maternal and child health care station in Shenyang, the health experimental station on the Northeast railway line, the treatment of syphilis in Inner Mongolia, industrial and mining hygiene in Anshan, and the work of transforming old midwives in various parts of North China, explaining that these works have been warmly supported and sponsored by the people, and have developed into large-scale mass movements. The exhibition also introduced the new academic system of schools such as the China Medical University, which plans to train 20,000 senior medical personnel in five years. The exhibition enabled every visitor to obtain sufficient health knowledge and understand that only the People's Government will spare no effort to protect the health of the people.

　　Chairman Mao's handwritten inscription "Heal the wounded, rescue the dying, practice revolutionary humanitarianism" and a painting of Chairman Mao meeting with wounded soldiers received great attention at the exhibition. The exhibition introduced many heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army's health work, especially the model of the underground hospital during the tunnel warfare in the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region during the Anti-Japanese War, which deeply moved the audience. The underground hospital had more than 40 connected tunnels, including operating rooms, pharmacies, and wounded soldier caves. The medical staff of the People's Liberation Army insisted on working in the tunnels and cured a large number of wounded and sick soldiers.

　　This exhibition was of great scale and was prepared for half a year in advance. The exhibits came from all over the country, totaling more than 10,000 pieces, covering an area of more than 3,000 square meters. The exhibition mobilized more than 600 health workers and medical school students to participate in the work, serving as commentators to explain the content of the exhibits to the audience at any time. The exhibition also distributed more than 50,000 copies of health propaganda materials.

　　To meet the demands of the broad masses, the content of the exhibition will be filmed and shown in various places after the exhibition.

　　全国卫生医药展览会
    受广大群众热烈欢迎
    展览期间观众共达三十四万
    【新华社三日讯】第一届全国卫生医药展览会在京举行，历二十五天，受广大群众热烈欢迎，已于八月三十日闭幕。展览会的观众达三十四万人，除北京、天津两市和两市附近各县、镇的一般人民群众外，有各学校、工厂、农村等六百多单位团体的有组织的群众。此外，天津、石家庄、太原、济南、青岛、上海、湖北、广州、沈阳、大连等地都组织了参观团远道来京参观。
    展览会用图画、模型、实物、表格、文字说明了“预防为主”是当前卫生工作的正确方针。展览会表明：在旧中国反动统治下广大的人民，长期陷于疾病，由于当时医药、科学不能发展，封建迷信的医疗方法流行，人民大量地死亡。在新中国，人民政府领导广大人民和疾病作斗争，已获得了相当的成绩。展览会着重介绍了各地防治传染病的经验。比如东北的鼠疫，一九四七年时有患者三万零三百二十六人，一九四九年就减到四百四十五人。展览会对各种传染病、多发病（如砂眼）、地方病的防治方法都作了生动、具体的介绍。展览会又介绍了沈阳的妇婴保健站、东北的铁路线卫生实验站、内蒙古的梅毒治疗、鞍山的工矿卫生、华北各地的改造旧产婆等工作，说明了这些工作都受到人民热烈地拥护和赞助，已发展的大规模的群众运动。展览会还介绍了中国医科大学等学校的新学制，这些学校计划在五年内将培养出二万名高级医务人材。展览会使每一个观众都能得到充分的卫生常识，并了解到只有人民政府才会对保障人民的健康不遗余力。
    毛主席的亲笔提字“救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义”和毛主席同伤兵见面的画幅在展览会中受到极大的注意。展览会介绍了人民解放军卫生工作的许多英勇事迹，尤其抗日战争时期晋冀察边区狼牙山地道战时地下医院的模型，使观众深受感动。地下医院有四十多个相连的地洞，有手术室、药库、伤员洞等，人民解放军的医务工作就在地洞里坚持工作，治愈了大批的伤病员。
    这次展览会规模巨大，事前经过了半年筹备，展览品来自全国各地，共万余件，占地三千多平方公尺，展览会动员了六百多名卫生工作人员和医科学校的学生参加工作，充当解说员的随时向观众解释展览品的内容。展览会还发出了卫生宣传品五万多份。
    为满足广大群众的要求，展览会内容在会后将摄制电影，到各地放映。
