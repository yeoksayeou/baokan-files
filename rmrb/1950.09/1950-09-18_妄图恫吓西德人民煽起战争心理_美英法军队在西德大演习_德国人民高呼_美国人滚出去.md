Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 15th: TASS, Berlin, 14th: The US, British, and French occupation forces in West Germany began on September 11th the largest military exercise since 1945 in the American occupation zone of southern Germany. More than 100,000 troops from three armies are participating, and five senior officers from Franco's army have also been invited to participate in the exercise alongside military personnel from the NATO countries.

The intention of this exercise is to intimidate the people of West Germany, destroy their will to resist, create an atmosphere of despair and the "inevitability" of war, and at the same time try to incite war psychology in order to more easily force the Germans to serve as cannon fodder for US imperialism.

But in reality, this exercise has strengthened the determination of the West German people, especially the youth, to stop the war-mongers' conspiracies on German soil. According to the *National Daily*, slogans demanding that the Americans get out of Germany have appeared on the walls of West Germany more frequently than usual in recent days. The newspaper pointed out: "Americans Get Out" is the cry of the German people, and it will continue to resound until the last soldier of the US-British interventionist forces leaves our country's west.

　　妄图恫吓西德人民煽起战争心理
    美英法军队在西德大演习
    德国人民高呼“美国人滚出去”
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社柏林十四日讯：美、英、法三国驻西德占领军，已于九月十一日开始在德国南部美国占领区举行一九四五年以来最大的一次军事演习。参加者有三个军队十万人以上，佛朗哥的高级军官五人亦应邀随同北大西洋公约各国军事人员参与演习。
    这次演习的意图是要恫吓西德人民，摧毁他们抵抗的意志，制造失望与战争“不可避免”的空气，同时打算煽起战争心理，以便更易于迫使德国人充当美帝国主义的炮灰。
    但是，实际上这次演习却加强了西德人民，尤其是青年们要制止战争贩子在德国国土上所进行的阴谋的决心。据《民族日报》称，恰恰就在这几天，西德各地墙壁上出现要求美国人滚出德国的标语的次数比平时更多了。该报指出：“美国滚出去”的口号便是德国人民的呼声，它将一直震响到美英干涉军最后一个兵士离开我们祖国西部的时候才休止。
