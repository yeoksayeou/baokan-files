　　New China's Woman Tractor Driver—Liang Jun

　　Learning from Basha, the Soviet woman tractor team leader, through her own hard work, hope has finally been realized: the first women's tractor team in New China has been established.

　　Liang Jun is twenty-one years old this year, and grew up in a poor peasant family in Dedu County, Heilongjiang. Poverty forced her to stop her studies before graduating from elementary school. In order to live, she worked in the landlord's vegetable garden, pulled grass, patched sacks...

　　In 1945, after the "August 15th" Northeast Liberation, she was also liberated from oppression. At that time, she repeatedly pondered how to get rid of this life of "washing pots and cooking". In March 1947, she left home and joined the newly established Dedu Mengya Township Teachers School. This school was built by the students themselves, and was a new type of school that closely combined labor and learning. They ate moldy noodles, slept on cold kang beds, and diligently spun thread, wove cloth, and reclaimed wasteland every day... Under the guidance of the principal and teachers, she gradually understood what kind of party the Communist Party was, and how she should work hard to strive for a bright future.

　　When the school sent her to study textile at the Bei'an Textile Factory, she was inspired by the female hero Danniang and Basha (Soviet tractor team leader) in Soviet films, and a new hope was burning in her heart. She thought, "Can I learn to drive a fire plow like Basha?"

　　In the spring of 1948, the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China opened a tractor training class in Bei'an. At this time, Liang Jun decided not to let go of this opportunity and resolutely requested to study, which was granted. After arriving at the training class, she was the only woman among the seventy or so students. The instructor asked her: "What are you here for?" "To learn how to drive a tractor." The instructor said: "Go back, you can't drive this, it's too dirty!" Many male students were also whispering, "Women are also learning to drive tractors?" Many people did not approve of admitting female students, thinking that women could not do this. Fortunately, the principal supported her and kept her. Throughout the learning process, the principal constantly encouraged her, and she herself worked very hard. Once, when the instructor was lecturing, she did not dare to reach out because she did not understand machinery, but the instructor insisted that she was afraid of getting dirty and criticized her. She was not discouraged by this, and persisted in learning with enthusiasm. Every time the instructor disassembled the machine to lecture, she listened attentively. She experimented once and twice, and asked if she didn't understand. Two months later, she triumphed. Not only did she learn to start the machine, but she also learned to inspect and repair it. When she jumped on the tractor, she was so happy that she burst into tears. The people followed closely, shouting: "Look, a woman is driving a fire plow."

　　After graduating from the training class, she and the male students drove the tractors back to school through ridges and hills. The teachers and students warmly welcomed them.

　　In the summer of 1948, the school was preparing to start large-scale production and bought three new tractors. Liang Jun was even happier, she thought: "I can use my own technology to create my own land." Under her influence, another female student, Wu Yuzhen, also learned to drive a tractor. The school selected a piece of land, which was a barren mountain and wild ridge more than 30 miles away from the city, and the land had never been reclaimed. The male students built a large shed to live in. Liang Jun and Wu Yuzhen also built their own small sheds, bending over to crawl in, living a hard and tense life. The tractors crawled back and forth on the weeds day and night. Liang Jun drove the tractor across the grassland. The midday sun was scorching, sweat flowed non-stop, and her clothes were immediately dried after being wet. At this time, she developed scabies, but she continued to work. During the summer hoeing season, she operated the machinery day and night, sleeping only four or five hours in the afternoon. She advanced side by side with the male students.

　　In order to popularize tractor technology, Liang Jun, like other male students, took on apprentices. In the first month, she taught Wu Yuzhen to drive a machine independently. Then she took on male apprentices. Later, even Wu Yuzhen took on apprentices.

　　During the entire reclamation process, the school trained a total of eighteen tractor drivers, and the two of them trained half of them.

　　She loved the machine as she loved her own life. One stormy night, she suddenly remembered that the magneto was still installed on the machine. She was afraid that the rain would damage the machine, making it difficult to start the next day, so she braved the heavy rain to remove the generator.

　　Last September, Liang Jun attended the Heilongjiang Provincial Communist Youth League Congress. She was honorably elected to the presidium of the congress, but she was not proud, and said modestly: "I am just one of you. Let us work together for a better future, giving off as much heat and light as we can."

　　Last winter, Liang Jun came to Beijing to participate in the Asian Women's Conference. At the meeting, she saw Commander-in-Chief Zhu, Comrade Liu Shaoqi and Comrade Zhou Enlai, and thought silently: "It is these people who saved China, saved women, and saved me."

　　With Liang Jun's highly enthusiastic help, eleven female students of Dedu Mengya Township Teachers School have been trained into a group of female tractor drivers. On June 3 this year, Liang Jun's hope was finally realized - the first women's tractor team in New China was established. Liang Jun took office as the captain of this team.

　　In the past four years, Liang Jun has transformed from a simple little girl into a female warrior, and also a glorious Communist Party member. She leads a group of tractor drivers, racing across the vast grassland all day long - shouldering the glorious task of building the country.

### 新中国的女拖拉机手——梁军

　　新中国的女拖拉机手——梁军
    向苏联的拖拉机女队长巴莎学习，从自己的辛勤努力中，希望终于实现了：新中国的第一个女拖拉机队成立了。
    梁军今年二十一岁，生长在黑龙江德都县的一个贫农家。贫穷使她初小未毕业便停止学业。为了生活，她曾给地主家收拾菜园了、蓐草、补麻袋……。
    一九四五年“八一五”东北解放，她也跟着从被压迫下解放了出来。当时她就反复思虑着，如何摆脱这“刷锅做饭”的生活。一九四七年的三月，她离开家，投进了刚成立的德都萌芽乡师。这学校是学生们自己动手修筑起来的，是劳动与学习紧紧结合的一所新型学校。他们吃发霉的面，睡寒冷的炕，每天辛勤地纺线、织布、开荒……在校长和教员的教导下，她逐渐了解共产党是怎样的一个党，自己应该怎样努力，争取未来光明的远景。
    当学校派她在北安纺织厂学习纺织时，她受了苏联电影中女英雄丹娘，巴莎（苏联拖拉机女队长）的启示，于是一个新的希望在她心里燃烧着，她想：“我能不能和巴莎一样学会开火犁呢？”
    一九四八年春天，中共黑龙江省委在北安开办一个拖拉机训练班。这时，梁军决不放过这个机会，坚决要求学习，结果得到了允许。到训练班后，七十多个学员中，只有她一个是女的。机师问她：“来干啥的？”“来学开拖拉机的。”机师说：“回去吧，你不能开这个，太脏了！”许多男同学也在叽咕“女人也来学开拖拉机吗？”许多人都不赞成收女学员，认为女人不能干这个。幸喜校长支持她，将她留下了。整个学习过程中，校长不断鼓励她，她自己也很努力。有一次机师在讲课时，她因为不懂机械，不敢伸手，但机师硬说她怕脏。把她批评了一顿，她没有因此而沮丧，抱着热忱坚持学习。每次机师卸机器讲课时，她都专心致意地听。一次二次的试验，不会就问。两个月后她胜利了，不但学会了开动机器，并且也学会了检查和修理。当她跳上拖拉机时，高兴得流泪了，老百姓紧紧地跟着，喊着：“看，女人开火犁了。”
    训练班毕业了，她与男同学同样开着拖拉机，经过一道道的野岭回校，老师和同学们热烈地欢迎了他们。
    一九四八年夏天，学校准备开始大生产，买了三台新拖拉机。梁军更高兴了，她想：“能够用自己的技术，创造自己的园地了。”在她影响下，另一个女同学吴玉珍也学驾驶拖拉机了。学校选择了一块地，是离城三十多里路的荒山野岭，土地从未被开垦过。男同学搭了一个大窝棚住。梁军和吴玉珍自己也搭了小窝棚，弯着身子钻进去，过着辛苦紧张的生活。拖拉机日夜不停地在野草上爬来爬去。梁军驾着拖拉机在草原驶去。晌午的太阳火热，汗不住的流，衣服湿了即刻又被晒干。这时，她生了疥疮，但她不停地工作。夏锄时，白天黑夜开动机械，只在下午睡四、五个钟头，她同样和男同学并肩前进。
    为了普及拖拉机的技术，梁军和其他男同学一样带徒弟。头一个月她就教会了吴玉珍单独驾驶一台机器。然后又带男徒弟。后来连吴玉珍也带了徒弟。
    整个开荒过程中，全校一共带出了十八个拖拉机手，她们两上带的就占了一半。
    她爱机器如爱她自己的生命，在一个风雨交加的深夜突然想起了磁石发电机还在机器上装着，她怕雨淋了机器，第二天不好发动，她就冒着大雨，把发电机拆回来。
    去年九月，梁军出席了黑龙江的省青年团代表大会，她荣誉地被选为大会主席团，但她并不骄傲，谦逊地说：“我只是你们当中的一个，让我们共同为美好的未来，有一分热，发一分光吧。”
    去年冬天，梁军到北京来参加亚洲妇代会。会上，她看见了朱总司令，刘少奇同志和周恩来同志，就默默地想：“正是这些人救了中国，救了妇女，救了我。”
    在梁军高度热忱的帮助下，德都萌芽乡师的十一名女学员，已锻炼成了一批女拖拉机手。今年六月三日，梁军的希望终于实现，——新中国的第一个女拖拉机队成立了。梁军就任这个队的队长。
    四年来，梁军已经由一个单纯的小女孩，变成了一位女战士，而且是一个光荣的共产党员。她领导着一群拖拉机手，终日在辽阔的大草原上奔驰着——担负起建设国家的光荣任务。
