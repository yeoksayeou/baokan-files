[Reported by this Newspaper] Zhejiang, Southern Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Henan and other provinces and regions, in order to make this year's autumn grain collection more fair and reasonable, have launched work on land consolidation and production appraisal. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance convened meetings of the heads of grain administration sections of various special districts and counties on June 9th and July 1st respectively to discuss land consolidation. Subsequently, pilot experiments were started in three different types of areas, namely those with land survey maps, those that had previously undergone land registration and those that had never undergone land consolidation, with a focus and in a step-by-step manner. It is expected that the province will complete this work by the end of September. According to incomplete statistics, by July 15th, 77 villages in Pinghu County, Jiaxing Special District, had completed land consolidation, accounting for 31% of the county's 248 villages. In July, Chizhou Special District in Southern Anhui completed key investigations in 55 villages. After summarizing the experience, it has been universally launched, and the entire special district is expected to be completed before September 10th.

According to the existing incomplete materials from various places, a large number of undeclared lands have been cleared out after preliminary land consolidation. For example, after investigation in 55 villages in 8 counties in Chizhou Special District in Southern Anhui, it was found that undeclared land accounted for 38.5% of the original acreage. Deng County in Nanyang Special District, Henan Province, found more than 70,000 mu of undeclared land, and Xichuan County found 20,000 mu.

The working method for land consolidation is generally as follows: In areas where land consolidation was carried out during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and where land registration maps are relatively complete, the old maps are first sorted according to the newly divided districts and townships, and the past lease relationships, new sales relationships, and non-cultivated land are clearly registered by household, and then posted for public review. In this work, in addition to first holding enlarged meetings of village cadres, meetings of villagers, and meetings of landlords and former Baojia heads to make them understand the significance of land consolidation and the work that should be done, attention is also paid to the education of old land administration personnel to help them sort out old materials. In Chizhou Special District, Southern Anhui, areas with more undeclared land and lower yields are selected as key areas to implement self-declaration, public discussion, public announcement, and mobilize the masses to report. At the beginning of the work, in-depth publicity is first carried out on land consolidation and burden policies to break the masses' concerns about suffering losses and bearing more burdens, and to let the masses rise up and do it themselves, creating a mass movement; at the same time, an investigation and evaluation committee is established to lead this work.

In the investigation and evaluation of yields, the general evidence is: the method of first dividing land into grades according to geology and then setting yields is a successful experience. In areas with tax units, the original land price map can be used to conduct on-the-spot investigation of yields, divide land sections into grades, and prove the average yield of each grade as the basis for evaluating yields. The situation in Zhejiang proves that the land price area map is divided according to the level of land prices obtained from actual surveys, and the level of land prices is based on the level of yield, so the tax unit is a very useful reference material for our yield evaluation work. However, some leading cadres in some areas still ignore the phenomenon of yield evaluation. After they clear out some undeclared land and achieve certain results, they think that "the task is accomplished" and do not further investigate land grades and evaluate yields. This will affect the fairness and rationality of grain collection. In addition, in the entire work process, some cadres still have serious tendencies to take over and do everything, and are not good at relying on the masses and cultivating activists among the masses to play a backbone role. Therefore, some cadres have neither mastered enough materials nor relied on the masses to humbly learn from the masses, so after the investigation is over, they still do not know how true the investigated materials are. In the use of cadres, it is still limited to the financial and grain departments; cadres from other departments also believe that implementing a reasonable burden is the work of the financial and grain departments.

Land consolidation work is not only related to whether the reasonable burden of agricultural tax can be realized, but also prepares good conditions for land reform work after the autumn harvest. Therefore, the above-mentioned deviations must be corrected immediately. In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, the number of land mu should be consolidated before the autumn grain collection, and the yield should be roughly evaluated.

　　浙江皖南江西湖南河南等省区积极进行评议产量
    初步查出大批黑田，为平衡秋征负担，提供有力保证。
    【本报讯】浙江、皖南、江西、湖南、河南等盛区，为使今年秋征达到进一步的公平合理，均展开了整理土地，评订产量的工作。浙江省财政厅远在六月九日和七月一日即分别召开了由各专、县粮政科长参加的土地整理会议，继即在有清丈图册和过去办过土地编查及根本未经过土地整理的三种不同地区，有重点有步骤地开始作典型试验，然后逐步扩展，预计全省九月底完成。据不完全统计：到七月十五日嘉兴专区平湖县即有七十七个村完成土地整理，占全县二百四十八个村的百分之三十一。皖南池州专区七月份的重点调查完成五十五个村，经总结经验后已普遍展开，全专区预计于九月十日前全部完成。
    根据各地现有的不完全的材料看，经过初步土地整理后，均清查出大量黑田。如皖南池州专区八个县五十五个村经调查后，发现黑田占原有亩数的百分之三十八点五。河南南阳专区邓县查出黑田七万余亩，淅川县查出二万亩。
    进行土地整理的工作方式，一般是在国民党反动统治时期已进行过土地整理，地籍图册亦较完全的地区，首先将旧图册按新划的区乡，分区分段加以整理，将过去的租佃关系，新的买卖关系，非耕地等分别按户登记清楚，再行张榜公布，发动群众核对。在这个工作中，除首先开好村干部扩大会，村民群众会，地主及旧保甲长会，使其了解土地整理意义及应做的工作外，还注意了对旧地政人员的教育，使其帮助整理旧材料。在皖南池州专区采取有重点地选择黑地较多，产量较低的地区，实行自报公议，张榜公布，发动群众检举。工作开始时，首先深入宣传土地整理与负担政策，打破群众怕吃亏多负担的思想顾虑，让群众起来自己搞，造成群众性的运动；同时建立调查评议委员会领导这一工作。
    在产量的调查评议上，一般证明：首先按地质分等，然后订定产量的办法是成功的经验。在有赋元的地区，可利用原有的地价图，实地调查产量，划分地段等级，证明各等级的平均产量，作为评订产量的根据。浙江情况证明，地价区域图是按实地查得的地价高低划分的，地价的高低是根据产量高低产生的，所以赋元对我们评订产量工作是很有用的参考材料。但有些地区的领导干部，还有忽视评订产量的现象。他们在清理出一部黑田，获得一定成绩后，即认为“完事大吉”，没有进一步去调查土地等级、评订产量。这是会影响到征收公粮的公平合理的。另外在整个工作进行中，有些干部还存在着严重的包办代替作风，不善于依靠群众及培养群众中的积极分子，使其起骨干作用。因此，有些干部既未掌握足够的材料，又未依靠群众、向群众虚心学习，所以调查结束以后，还不知道调查的材料究竟真实性如何。在干部的运用上，亦还仅限于财粮部门；别的部门的干部也认为实行合理负担是财粮部门的工作。
    土地整理工作不仅关系农业税合理负担的能否实现，也是为秋后的土地改革工作准备良好的条件。因此，上述偏差必须立即改正。而在未土改的地区应于秋征前整理好土地亩数，大体评订好产量。
