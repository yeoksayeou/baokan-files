Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 20th: The Fifth General Assembly of the United Nations opened on September 19th at Flushing Meadow near New York. This General Assembly opened under particularly complex international circumstances. The aggressive ruling clique of the United States has been conducting armed intervention against the people of Korea and China. They are attempting to use the United Nations as a smokescreen to cover up their acts of aggression.

As usual, the meeting hall was crowded when the General Assembly convened. The visitor and press sections were full. The American people showed a particularly great interest in the General Assembly. In the days leading up to the meeting, the United Nations Secretariat received five to six thousand applications for observing the proceedings each day. On September 19th, long before the opening of the General Assembly, the visitor section was already packed.

Representatives of the member states attending the General Assembly took their seats. As in previous meetings, the Soviet delegation, headed by Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky, was the center of attention. The delegation of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, headed by Baranovsy, and the delegation of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, headed by Kiselev, also took their seats.

The outgoing President of the Fourth General Assembly, Philippine Foreign Minister Romulo, seized the opportunity in his opening address to promote the views of aggressive American imperialism. Romulo attempted to support the American effort to transfer the responsibility for maintaining peace and security from the Security Council to the General Assembly, in order to undermine the principle of great power consensus and the prestige of the Security Council. He said: "In the event of a crisis, if the body primarily responsible for dealing with such a crisis is paralyzed and unable to perform its duties, the actual unlimited deliberative power of the General Assembly can be transformed into effective action. Although there have been precedents for such developments in the past, the most serious of such problems facing the General Assembly is the current one."

Indian Representative Rau Reads Indian Proposal
Following Romulo's speech, Indian Representative Rau requested to speak and read India's proposal, which stipulated that representatives of the People's Republic of China should represent China at the General Assembly, and recommended that other United Nations bodies take similar action. Rau said that he believed this issue should be resolved early in the General Assembly session, but he asked the President of the General Assembly to decide whether the issue should be dealt with before the Credentials Committee made its report, or after reference to the report.

President Romulo carefully suggested that the General Assembly should decide whether to deal with the issue raised by the Indian representative. He said that, in his view, it would be appropriate to do so. However, since the proposal was put forward at this time, procedural issues not listed in the rules of procedure had arisen, so Romulo considered it inappropriate for the President to rule on whether the rules of procedure applied to the current environment. However, he suggested that since the General Assembly could make its own decisions on procedure, the General Assembly should decide whether to deal with the Indian proposal.

Soviet Representative Vyshinsky Speaks in Support of China's Demand to Attend the General Assembly
Next, Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke. He said that the Soviet delegation felt it necessary to raise two issues with the General Assembly: first, the issue of the Kuomintang representatives attempting to represent China at the General Assembly; and second, the issue of inviting representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the General Assembly. Vyshinsky pointed out that all member states should be most concerned about whether the General Assembly had the proper composition and whether the plenary session was composed of people authorized to represent their countries. The Soviet representative pointed out that Rule 27 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Assembly stipulates that only heads of state, heads of government, or foreign ministers are authorized to appoint representatives to the United Nations General Assembly. Vyshinsky said that this article contained a particularly important provision, namely, recognition of the sovereignty of the member states of the United Nations, recognition of their political sovereignty, and recognition of the principle that the United Nations does not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation believed that strict adherence to the principles of international law was the most important condition for the success of the General Assembly's activities. Vyshinsky continued, therefore, that the situation in which those who do not represent their country—the remnants of a regime rejected by the people who established their own People's Republic—were attending the General Assembly was intolerable. The Soviet representative said that these people had no right to represent China, either politically, morally, or legally. Vyshinsky reminded the General Assembly that the Premier of the People's Republic of China had demanded that the Kuomintang representatives be expelled from the General Assembly. Vyshinsky said that the Soviet delegation, on the instructions of the Soviet government, fully supported this demand of the Chinese government. The head of the Soviet delegation put forward the following draft resolution: "The General Assembly hereby decides that, since the representatives of the Kuomintang clique are not representatives of China, they shall not participate in the General Assembly." Vyshinsky said that he reserved the right to propose the invitation of representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the General Assembly after the discussion of the proposal just put forward by the Soviet delegation had been completed. Vyshinsky mentioned that the Indian representative had already pointed out that this issue had no precedent in the history of the General Assembly's work, and said that this situation should not hinder the discussion of such an important issue. Vyshinsky urged the General Assembly to consider his proposal immediately.

Yugoslav Representative Kardelj supported India's proposal. Kuomintang representative Jiang Tingfu, in his lengthy inflammatory speech, slandered the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, and demanded that the General Assembly recognize the reactionary Kuomintang clique as the representatives of China.

U.S. Representative Acheson followed Jiang Tingfu by urging the General Assembly to immediately reject India's proposal to accept representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the meeting.

Acheson Unreasonably Opposes Our Representatives Attending
Acheson opposed the attendance of representatives of the People's Republic of China. He used as an excuse that forty-three member states of the United Nations maintained formal relations with the Kuomintang, while only sixteen member states had established relations with the People's Republic of China. He also asserted that considering the Indian proposal would inevitably be time-consuming, hinder the organization of the General Assembly's work, and delay the handling of important matters. Acheson believed that there would be opportunities to consider the China issue at a later date in the General Assembly. In conclusion, he again urged the General Assembly to immediately reject the Indian proposal.

Polish Representative Speaks in Support of Soviet Proposal
Polish Representative Wierblowski supported the Soviet proposal, saying that the Polish representative was deeply surprised to return to the General Assembly and see the Kuomintang clique, which represents no one, usurping the name of the representatives of the Chinese people to make false claims. This farcical comedy of a dance of the dead has been going on for more than a year. No one doubts the true nature of this clique. Even the U.S. government, which still supports this clique, had to confess to the corruption of the Kuomintang in the White Paper presented by Acheson. Wierblowski emphasized that the Kuomintang lacked the most basic premise for membership in the United Nations, first of all, the most basic qualifications of a country. He emphasized that the Kuomintang could not undertake or fulfill the basic obligations stipulated in the United Nations Charter. He continued that the Kuomintang was unable to defend peace because it was interested in provoking war, as Chiang Kai-shek had often proven. The Kuomintang was devoted to violating the interests of the United Nations. Since the failure of U.S. imperialist intervention in China, which resulted in the Kuomintang being driven out of mainland China, the Kuomintang has only been able to survive by relying on U.S. protection. The purpose of the United States is to continue its imperialist intervention in China. Wierblowski also said that the composition of the General Assembly could not be considered legitimate without the participation of the representatives of the Chinese people. In order to eliminate the obstacles that hinder the General Assembly from functioning normally, the representatives of the Kuomintang clique must be expelled from the hall. The General Assembly should cast aside the decadent puppets of U.S. imperialism and allow the true representatives of the Chinese people to attend. In conclusion, Wierblowski said that the Polish representative strongly protested the presence of the Kuomintang clique here and supported the Soviet proposal.

Vyshinsky Rises Again to Speak, Denouncing Acheson's Contradictory Statements
Vyshinsky spoke again, saying that since the debate had shown that the issue of the illegal attendance of Kuomintang representatives at the General Assembly and the issue of inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the General Assembly were closely related, the Soviet delegation felt it necessary to also address the second issue. Vyshinsky continued that U.S. Secretary of State Acheson had suggested that the General Assembly not discuss the Indian delegation's proposal, not discuss the essence of the issue facing the General Assembly, which was obviously afraid that he would put himself in an awkward position if he really had to discuss these issues. Vyshinsky pointed out that the delay in considering inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the General Assembly was unacceptable, and said that this issue was not only extremely important to the United Nations, but also extremely important to the great Chinese people who had been fighting for liberation for decades and had finally achieved their goal. Vyshinsky said that only the representatives of the people have the right to stay here. But, Mr. Acheson, are you not clearly aware that the Kuomintang clique does not represent China? Vyshinsky recounted that in a statement made on January 12, 1950, Acheson had admitted that the Chinese people had completely rejected the Kuomintang clique. Acheson said in his letter presenting the famous State Department White Paper that, according to many observers, they (the Kuomintang – editor) were corrupt and power-grabbing. Vyshinsky said, "Mr. Acheson has obviously forgotten his own two statements..." Vyshinsky continued amid laughter from the visitors and reporters in the audience, "Mr. Acheson was absolutely right at that time, I want to defend Acheson and refute Mr. Acheson, because he was indeed right at that time." Vyshinsky went on to quote General Stilwell, former commander of the U.S. military in China, who had called the Kuomintang clique a gang of morally bankrupt murderers. Vyshinsky continued: "The Soviet delegation believes that the General Assembly must immediately make a decision on the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China in this session... The Soviet delegation must also draw the General Assembly's attention to a situation that is absolutely unacceptable and intolerable: the People's Republic of China—a great country with nearly 500 million people—is legitimately demanding the removal of all obstacles to its lawful participation in the work of the United Nations and all its agencies, but it does not yet have its representatives participating in the United Nations... Based on all that has been said above, and on the instructions of the Soviet government, the Soviet delegation submits the following draft resolution to the General Assembly: "The General Assembly hereby decides to invite the representatives appointed by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the work of the General Assembly and its affiliated agencies."

Indian Representative Speaks Again, Insisting on Inviting Our Representatives to Attend
Indian Representative Rau rose again to speak in support of his proposal. He pointed out that, among other things, the People's Government of China is the only government that is able to control China and fulfill China's responsibilities and obligations. He said that as long as this country with 475 million people remains outside this world organization, it cannot be considered a fully representative organization.

Syrian Representative Ghory then spoke, declaring that the issue of the Chinese representatives being raised on the first day of the General Assembly was an "unexpected event" for him. He stated that more time was needed to properly study the issue. He suggested postponing the vote on the various proposals until September 20, and continuing the election of the Credentials Committee (this proposal was subsequently rejected by the General Assembly).

Canadian Representative Pearson then defended the Canadian proposal, which suggested that a special committee composed of the President of the General Assembly and six other representatives chosen by the President consider the issue of Chinese representation, and report and make recommendations to the current session of the General Assembly after the General Assembly had considered item 62 on the agenda—"Recognition by the United Nations of the representation of member states."

Representatives of Czechoslovakia, Australia, El Salvador, Cuba, Sweden, and Ukraine spoke next.

U.S. Manipulates "Voting Machine" to Illegally Reject Soviet and Indian Proposals
After the representative of Peru spoke, insisting on the immediate election of the Credentials Committee, the General Assembly began voting on the various proposals. Because the U.S. voting machine was activated, the General Assembly rejected the Soviet and Indian proposals to invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend, and passed the Canadian proposal.

The General Assembly passed the first part of the Canadian proposal by a vote of 38 to 6, with 11 abstentions. This part suggested that a special committee composed of the President of the General Assembly and six other representatives chosen by the President consider the issue of Chinese representation, and submit a report and recommendations to the General Assembly "after the General Assembly discusses item 62 on the provisional agenda." (Note: item 62 on the agenda is the "Recognition by the United Nations of the Representation of Member States" case proposed by Cuba.) The General Assembly then passed the second part of the Canadian proposal by a vote of 42 in favor, 8 against, and 6 abstentions. This part declared that the General Assembly "decides that, pending a decision by the General Assembly based on the report of this special committee, the Kuomintang representatives shall continue to attend the General Assembly and have the same rights as other representatives." As such, the entire Canadian proposal was passed by a vote of 42 in favor, 9 against, and 6 abstentions. After the American and British majority in the General Assembly rejected the Soviet proposal, Vyshinsky made a brief statement, saying that the Soviet delegation believed that the resolution passed was illegal and incorrect. He said that no one would have any doubt that only the representatives appointed by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China could represent the Chinese people.

Romulo then appointed the Credentials Committee, which consisted of the following countries: Belgium, Chile, India, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, the Soviet Union

　　联合国第五届大会第一日
    苏联印度提议邀我国代表出席
    维辛斯基指出国民党“代表”无权代表中国
    【新华社二十日讯】塔斯社纽约二十日讯：联合国第五届大会于九月十九日在纽约附近佛拉辛草地开幕。本届大会是在特别复杂的国际形势中开幕的。美国侵略统治集团已在对朝鲜和中国人民进行武装干涉。他们正试图利用联合国作为烟幕，来掩盖他们的侵略行动。
    像往常一样，在联大开会的时候，会议大厅已挤满了人。来宾及记者席都已坐满。美国人民对联大表现了特别大的兴趣。在会议前夕，联合国秘书处每天都收到五、六千件旁听申请书。九月十九日，在联大会议开幕前很久，来宾席便已坐得满满的了。
    出席联大的会员国代表就座。像以前各次会议一样，以苏联外交部长维辛斯基为首的苏联代表团是众目所瞩的中心。以巴拉诺夫斯基为首的乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国代表团与以基塞列夫为首的白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国代表团也就座。
    行将卸任的第四届联大主席、菲律宾外交部长罗慕洛在致开幕词时，乘机鼓吹侵略性的美国帝国主义的观点。罗慕洛试图赞助美国的努力，即把安理会维持和平与安全的责任转移给联大，以便破坏大国一致的原则，破坏安理会的威信。他说：“在发生危机时，如果负有处理这种危机的主要责任的机构被瘫痪得不能执行任务，大会的实际的无限制的评议权力，便可以转变成有效的行动。虽然大会的权力以前也有过这样发展的先例，可是大会所真正面临的这类问题却以目前这次为最严重。”
  印度代表劳氏宣读印度提案
    继罗慕洛讲演之后，印度代表劳氏要求发言，并宣读印度的提案，其中规定由中华人民共和国的代表代表中国出席联大，并建议联合国其他机构采取类似行动。劳氏说：他认为这个问题应该在联大会议初期解决，但是他请联大的主席去决定此问题究竟应该在资格审查委员会作报告之前即行处理，还是应该在参照该项报告以后再作处理。
    主席罗慕洛小心翼翼地建议：大会应决定是否处理印度代表提出的问题。他说：在他看来，这样作是适当的。但是既然由于这一提案在目前提出，发生了程序规则中没有胪列的程序问题，所以罗慕洛认为由主席来裁决程序规则是否适用于目前环境，是不适当的。然而他建议：既然联大对于程序可以自己作主，因此联大便应该决定是否处理印度的提案。
    苏联代表维辛斯基发言支持我国对大会的要求
    接着是苏联代表维辛斯基发言。他说：苏联代表团认为有必要向大会提出两个问题：第一，企图代表中国的国民党代表出席大会的问题。第二，邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表出席大会的问题。维辛斯基指出：所有各个会员国对于大会是否有确当的成份对于全体会议是否由有权代表他们国家的人组成，都应当有最大的关心。苏联代表指出：大会程序规则第二十七条规定，只有国家的元首，政府的首脑或外交部长才有权任命出席联合国大会的代表。维辛斯基说：这一条包含了一项特别重要的规定，那就是承认联合国各会员国的主权，承认它们的政治主权，承认联合国不干涉其他国家内政的原则。维辛斯基说：苏联代表团认为严格地承认国际法的原则，是大会的活动能否成功的最重要的条件。维辛斯基继续说：因此，那些不代表他们国家的人们——被建立了自己的人民共和国的人民所唾弃的政权的残余分子——居然出席大会的情形，是不能容忍的。苏联代表说：这些人不论在政治上，道义上或者法律上都没有权利代表中国。维辛斯基提醒大会说：中华人民共和国总理已提出将国民党代表开除出大会的要求。维辛斯基说：苏联代表团奉苏联政府的训令，充分支持中国政府的这个要求。苏联代表团团长提出决议草案如下：“大会兹决定：由于国民党集团的代表并非中国的代表，故认为他们不可能参加大会。”维辛斯基说：他保留在苏联代表团刚才提出的提案讨论完毕后提出邀请中华人民共和国代表出席大会之提案的权利。维辛斯基提起印度代表已经指出过，这个问题在大会的工作史上还不曾有过先例，并说：这种情形并不能妨碍这种重要问题的讨论。维辛斯基敦促大会立即考虑他提出的提案。
    南斯拉夫代表卡德尔支持印度的提案。国民党代表蒋廷黻在他冗长的煽动演说中毁谤苏联和中华人民共和国，并要求大会承认反动的国民党集团为中国的代表。
    美国代表艾奇逊继蒋廷黻之后敦促大会立即否决印度关于接受中华人民共和国代表出席会议的提案。
    艾奇逊蛮不讲理反对我代表出席
    艾奇逊反对中华人民共和国代表出席。他借口说：联合国大会有四十三个成员国与国民党保持正式的关系，而只有十六个成员国与中华人民共和国建立了关系。他并且断言：对于印度提案加以考虑，则势必旷日持久，妨碍大会工作的组织，而且耽搁重要事务的处理，艾奇逊认为在大会以后期间必有考虑中国问题的机会。他在结语中再度敦促大会立即否决印度的提案。
    波兰代表发言支持苏联提案
    波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基支持苏联的提案称：波兰代表回到大会来，又看到不代表任何人的国民党集团僭夺中国人民代表的名义来申述错误的主张，深感惊讶。这种死人舞蹈的滑稽剧，已经延续到一年以上了。谁也不怀疑这个集团的真正性质。甚至现在还支持这一集团的美国政府，都不得不在艾奇逊所提出的白皮书中供述了国民党的腐败。威尔勃洛夫斯基强调国民党缺乏联合国成员资格最基本的前提，首先是缺乏一个国家最基本的资格。他着重指出：国民党不能承担或履行联合国宪章所规定的基本义务。他继称：国民党是不能保卫和平的，因为它是对挑拨战争感觉兴趣的，正如蒋介石所经常证实的那样。国民党专心致志违背联合国的利益。自美帝国主义干涉中国遭受失败，结果使国民党被驱出中国大陆以后，国民党便只有靠美国的庇护才能苟延残喘。美国的目的是要继续对中国进行帝国主义式的干涉。威尔勃洛夫斯基并称：假若没有中国人民的代表参加，就不能认为大会的成份是合法的。为了消除妨害大会发生正常效能的障碍，必须将国民党集团的代表逐出会场。大会应该抛开美帝国主义的腐朽的傀儡，而让中国人民的真正代表出席。威尔勃洛夫斯基在结语中称：波兰代表坚决抗议国民党集团在这里出现，并且支持苏联的提案。
    维辛斯基再度起立发言斥艾奇逊前言不照后语
    维辛斯基再度发言说：既然辩论已说明国民党代表非法出席大会的问题和邀请中华人民共和国代表出席大会的问题是密切相关的，苏联代表团便认为必须也谈到第二个问题。维辛斯基接着说：美国国务卿艾奇逊曾建议大会不讨论印度代表团的提案，不讨论大会所面临的问题之本质，这显然是害怕一旦真要讨论这些问题时，便会使自己陷入窘境。维辛斯基指出：对于考虑邀请中华人民共和国代表参加大会一事的延迟是不可容许的，并说：这一问题不但对联合国是极端重要的，即对数十年来一直为争取解放而斗争而且最后已达到其目的的伟大的中国人民，也是极端重要的。维辛斯基说，只有人民的代表才有权利留在这里。但是，艾奇逊先生，难道你不清楚明白国民党集团并不代表中国么？维辛斯基追述道：艾奇逊在一九五○年一月十二日所作的声明中，曾承认中国人民已完全唾弃了国民党集团。艾奇逊在其提出的著名的国务院白皮书时所写的信上说：根据许多观察家的意见，他们（国民党人——编者）是腐化的，争权夺利的。维辛斯基说：“艾奇逊先生显然已忘记了他自己的这两个声明……”维辛斯基在列席旁听的来宾与记者哄堂大笑声中继续说：“艾奇逊先生那时是完全正确的，我要为艾奇逊辩护，反驳艾奇逊先生，因为那时他的确是正确的。”维辛斯基进而援引前驻华美军总司令史迪威将军的话，史迪威将军曾把国民党集团称作丧尽道德的杀人犯伙帮。维辛斯基继续说：“苏联代表团认为大会必须立即就中华人民共和国代表参加本届大会一事作出决定………苏联代表团同时必须提起大会注意一种绝对不能接受和不能容忍的情况，就是：中华人民共和国——一个拥有将近五万万人口的伟大国家正当地要求消除一切障碍使它合法地参加联合国及其一切机构的工作，但在联合国内却还没有它的代表参加。………苏联代表团基于上面所说的一切，并奉苏联政府的训令，向大会提出下列决议草案：“大会兹决定：邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府所指派的代表参加大会及其所属各机构的工作。”
  印度代表再度发言坚持邀我代表出席
    印度代表劳氏再度起立发言支持他的提案。他指出：不论其他一切，中国人民政府是能够控制中国并尽中国的责任与义务的唯一的政府。他说道：只要此一拥有四万七千五百万人民的国家仍在这个世界组织之外，就不能认为它是一个具有充分代表性的组织。
    叙利亚代表古里继起发言，他宣称：中国代表的问题在大会的第一日提出来，对于他是一件“出乎意外的事情”。他申说，需要更多的时间来适当地研究这个问题。他建议把各种提案延至九月二十日再行表决，而继续选举资格审查委员会（这个提议随后被大会否决了）。
    加拿大代表皮尔逊于是便为加拿大的提案辩护，该提案建议由大会主席及其他六个为主席选择的代表组成特别委员会，考虑中国代表权问题，并在大会已考虑议程第六十二项——“联合国对会员国代表权的承认”——以后，向联大本届会议提出报告和建议。
    接着发言的是捷克斯洛伐克、澳大利亚、萨尔瓦多、古巴、瑞典与乌克兰的代表。
    美国操纵“表决机器”非法否决苏联印度提案
    在秘鲁代表发言坚持立即选举资格审查委员会以后，大会开始表决各种提案。因为美国表决机器的开动，大会否决了苏联与印度关于邀请中华人民共和国代表出席的提案，而通过了加拿大的提案。
    大会以三十八票对六票，另有十一票弃权，通过加拿大提案的第一部分，这一部分建议由大会主席及其他六个为主席选择的代表组成特别委员会，考虑中国代表权问题，并“在大会讨论临时议程第六十二项以后”，向大会提出报告和建议。（按议程第六十二项为古巴所提出的“联合国对会员国代表权的承认”案）接着大会便以四十二票赞成、八票反对与六票弃权，通过了加拿大提案的第二部分，这一部分宣称：大会“决定：在大会根据这一特别委员会的报告作出决定以前，国民党代表仍出席大会，与其他代表有同样的权利”。如是，加拿大全部提案便以四十二票赞成，九票反对与六票弃权而获通过。大会的美英多数否决了苏联的提案以后，维辛斯基曾发表简短声明，大意说：苏联代表团认为所通过的决议是非法的，不正确的。他说：谁也不会有任何怀疑：只有中华人民共和国中央人民政府委派的代表，才能代表中国人民。
    罗慕洛接着便委派资格审查委员会，该委员会由下列各国组成：比利时、智利、印度、墨西哥、泰国、土耳其、苏联、联合王国与美国。联合国大会以三十二票选举伊朗代表安迪让为主席。巴基斯坦代表查佛鲁拉得二十二票，捷克斯洛伐克代表西罗基得四票，波兰代表威尔勃洛夫斯基得一票。因有五十九国代表参加，必须有三十票始能当选。
