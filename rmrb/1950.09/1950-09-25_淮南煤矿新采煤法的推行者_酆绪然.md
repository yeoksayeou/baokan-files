　　Promoter of New Coal Mining Methods in Huainan Coal Mine
    Feng Xuran
      A Rational Suggestion, Efficiency Increased by 88 Percent
    When the July 1st Brigade of Huainan Coal Mine Workers' Organization was experimenting with new coal mining methods, Feng Xuran, a twenty-five-year-old worker, achieved brilliant results.
    Originally, coal mining in Huainan Coal Mine involved digging five small steps in the coal seam tunnel, with the fifth step being seventeen meters away from the old mine's collapse line. Maintaining the seventeen-meter roof without collapsing was extremely difficult at the time and posed a great threat to the safety of the workers' lives. At this point, Feng Xuran suggested to the engineers: extend the steps and merge them into three steps, reducing the distance from the step working face to the old mine's collapse line to eleven meters. This not only reduced the danger of the work but also increased production. Originally, when working on five small steps, the steps were short, and the pneumatic drill was not easy to use effectively. At that time, two coal miners were assigned to each step, advancing one meter per shift, producing 11.7 tons of coal, with an efficiency of 5.85 tons per person. After the step face was lengthened, the number of coal miners and the advance per shift remained the same as before. Coal production reached 22 tons, with an efficiency of 11 tons per person, an increase of more than 88 percent compared to before.
    Not only that, Feng Xuran also looked after one step by himself, creating a new record of 26.39 tons of coal, and making it possible for other workers to change from two people looking after one step to one person looking after one step, also creating a new record.
      To Improve Production, You Must Find the Trick
    Why was Feng Xuran able to achieve such great results? The main reason is that he is willing to think of ways and work hard to study technology. He knew that a person's strength is limited, and you must find the trick to get the job done. He firmly grasped the "improve efficiency" key, instead of rigidly increasing labor intensity. When he first used a pneumatic drill to mine coal, he couldn't control it at first, and the drill bounced around. He couldn't figure out the coal cleat (the splitting property of coal) or how to feed the drill bit, and he was exhausted and couldn't get any work done. So, when working, he experimented with inserting the drill bit up, down, left, and right. Gradually, he learned the temperament of the pneumatic drill, his hand became steady, and he could use it freely. For example, when mining coal, he thought, "Isn't taking down a large piece of coal all at once like swallowing a large steamed bun in one bite? It's hard to swallow and makes you suffer; if you take two or three bites, it will go down smoothly," and the experiment proved that it saved effort.
      Creating New Records
    Old Feng's constant research on technology, coupled with his very strong body, gave him the conditions to create new records.
    He and worker Liu Yuxi were working on a step, advancing one meter. In the first shift (three hours each time), they could undercut six or seven meters. When the second shift came, it didn't take long to finish undercutting. He thought, "If we advance further, I'm afraid we won't be able to finish undercutting, which will affect the progress of the entire working face; if we don't advance, it would be a pity to waste time." So he discussed with Lao Liu, "Lao Liu, can we work on one step by ourselves?" Lao Liu thought for a while and said, "Yes! If we can't finish, we'll gnaw it with our teeth!"
    On August 23rd, after the team headquarters issued a call to create new records, middle shift workers Qiu Ziwne, An Chaofu, night shift workers Feng Xuran, Liu Yuxi, and others were the first to respond. That shift, he worked on the second step, which was 1.8 meters wide and 9.4 meters high, advancing 1.2 meters in four and a half hours, creating an unprecedented record of mining 26.39 tons of coal. Later, he continuously created new records of advancing 1.3 meters on the second step, 1.1 meters on the first step, and 2 meters on the third step, consolidating the new records and continuing to move forward. Under his encouragement and help, workers Sun Shujiang, Mi Hanzhang, and others also created new records, making each person competent and happy to be in charge of one step of work.
      Helping Others Do Their Work Well
    Feng Xuran not only does his own work well, but also often helps others. In the past, two people were assigned to a step. If the other worker's skills were poorer, he would teach him how to pull grooves, split sides, insert drills, etc., and he would also study technology with him, and the two would discuss everything. When working, he always did the steps left over by other workers. The work on the third step was the most difficult, requiring crawling through narrow holes and undercutting the step. Undercutting the step affected crawling through narrow holes, and not crawling through narrow holes affected the work of the next shift. The coal was also hard, and the pneumatic drill just smoked. It always took five or six hours for others to advance one meter and they were exhausted. Lao Feng often worked on the third step, never complaining. He could advance two meters in just four and a half hours. After finishing his own work, Lao Feng also helped workers on other steps to dig coal, helped support workers to pass materials, dig pillar sockets, and drive roof pillars.
    Feng Xuran was not always so willing to help others, willing to use his brain, and have such good work results. Before the liberation of Huainan Coal Mine, that goes without saying. At that time, Huainan Coal Mine belonged to the bureaucratic capitalist war criminal Song Ziwen, and the workers lived on the edge of a knife all day long. Who had the energy to work hard? After the liberation of Huainan Coal Mine, the workers turned over and became masters, and everyone knew that they had to work hard. However, Feng Xuran's enthusiasm had not yet been fully developed, and he always worked alone, following others. If someone else dug a hole to eight hundred (0.8 meters), he would never dig to eight hundred and one. In March of this year, he joined the New Democratic Youth League, and everything changed. Under the constant criticism and help of his comrades, Feng Xuran corrected his mistakes, and thus created brilliant results. (Reprinted from Wanbei Daily)

### 淮南煤矿新采煤法的推行者  酆绪然

　　淮南煤矿新采煤法的推行者
    酆绪然
      一项合理建议，效率提高百分之八十八
    淮南煤矿工人组织的七一大队在试验新采煤法的时候，二十五岁的工人酆绪然创造了辉煌的成绩。
    淮南煤矿采煤，原来是在煤层坑道中拉五个小台阶，第五台阶离老塘坍塌线十七公尺。而维持十七公尺的顶板不坍塌在当时是十分困难的，对工人生命安全有极大威胁。这时候，酆绪然就向工程师建议：把台阶延长，合并为三个台阶，使台阶工作面到老塘坍塌线的距离缩短为十一公尺。这样，不但减少了工作的危险性，而且提高了产量。原来在五个小台阶工作的时候，台阶短，风镐不容易发挥效力。那时候，每个台阶按上两个采煤工，每班进尺一公尺，产煤十一点七吨，每人效率合五点八五吨。台阶面加长后，采煤工数和每班进尺与以前相同。产煤达二十二吨，每人效率合十一吨，比以前提高百分之八十八以上。
    不但这样，酆绪然还一人看一个台阶，创造了采煤二十六点三九吨的新纪录，并使得其他工友也由两人看一个台阶改为一人看一个，也创造了新纪录。
      要提高生产，非摸到窍门不可
    为什么酆绪然能够创造这样大的成绩呢？最主要的是因为他肯想办法，努力钻研技术。他知道：一个人的力气是有限的，干活非得摸窍门不可。他紧紧抓住“提高效率”这个牛鼻子，不是死硬的提高劳动强度。他头一回用风镐采煤时，乍用起风镐来降不住，镐乱蹦，一上来也摸不清炭滑（煤的劈裂性）也不知怎送钎，累的一身汗也干不出活来。于是，干活时，上下左右地试验插镐，这样慢慢就摸着风镐的脾气了，手把也硬了，运用自如了。再比方采煤的时候，他捉摸：“硬是要一下子拿下一块大炭，不是跟一口吞大馍一样吗？吃不下去还受罪；要是做两三口来吃就顺顺当当的下去了”，试验一下真的省了劲。
      创造新纪录
    老酆不断的研究技术，再加上他十分健壮的身体，就给他创造新纪录具备了条件。
    他和刘玉喜工友干的一个台阶，前进一米，在第一次风（每次三小时）可以卧六、七米，等第二次来风不要多大会就卧完了。他想：“再进吧，恐怕卧不完了，影响整个工作面的进度；要是不进了吧，时间浪费了怪可惜的。”于是他就和老刘商量：“老刘，咱一个人干一个台阶行不行？”老刘捉摸了一会说：“行！要是完不成，就是使牙啃也啃完了！”
    八月二十三日，在队部发出创造新纪录的号召后，中班工友邱芝文、安朝福、夜班工友酆绪然、刘玉喜等首先响应，当班他做第二台阶，宽一·八公尺，高九·四公尺，四小时半前进一·二公尺，创造了采煤二六·三九吨的空前纪录。以后又连续创造在第二台阶上进尺一·三公尺，第一台阶进尺一·一公尺，第三台阶进尺二公尺的新纪录，使新纪录巩固下来和继续前进。在他的鼓舞与帮助下，工友孙树江、米汉章等也创造了新纪录，使每人担任一个台阶的工作，都可胜任愉快了。
      帮助别人把活干好
    酆绪然不但自己干活好，还时常帮助别人。以前，一个台阶上安两个人，要是另外那个工友的技术差一些，他就教他，怎样拉槽子、劈帮、插镐等等，还跟他研究技术，干什么都是两人商量着干。干活的时候，他总是作别的工友剩下的台阶。第三台阶的活最难干，要穿毛洞，还要卧台阶，卧台阶影响穿毛洞，不穿毛洞就影响下班工作，炭又硬，风镐光冒烟，别人干一米总是要五、六个钟头还要累身汗。老酆时常是干第三台阶，从来不说怪话，他干两米只要四个半钟头。自己的活干完了，老酆还帮助别的台阶上的工友刨煤，帮助支柱工传材料、掏柱窝子、打顶柱。
    酆绪然并不是一直都这么肯帮助别人、肯用脑子，而且有这么好的工作成绩的。在淮南煤矿还没有解放的时候那是不用说。那个时候，淮南煤矿是官僚资本家战争罪犯宋子文的，工人整天生活在刀尖上，谁还有劲好好干活？淮南煤矿解放之后，工人翻身当了主人，大家都知道要好好干活了。可是酆绪然的积极性还没有充分发挥，他总是一个人闷着头干活，跟着别人走。人家刨眼刨八百（○·八米），他决不刨八百一。今年三月，他加入了新民主主义青年团，一切就不同了，在同志们不断的批评、帮助之下，酆绪然改正了自己的错误，因此就创造出了辉煌的成绩。（转载皖北日报）
