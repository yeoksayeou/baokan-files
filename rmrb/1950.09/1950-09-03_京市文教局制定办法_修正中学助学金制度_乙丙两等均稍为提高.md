[Beijing News Agency] Beijing Municipal Bureau of Education has formulated the following revised measures regarding the grade standards for people's grants to students in public and private secondary schools in this city, the percentage of students receiving grants, review criteria, and application procedures, based on the current financial strength of the government and the improvement opinions of relevant units; and has instructed all schools to implement them starting in September.

	1. In order to improve students' meals and promote health, the three grade standards for people's grants will be adjusted. The highest grade A will remain unchanged at 70 jin, grade B will be increased from 50 jin to 60 jin, and grade C will be increased from 35 jin to 40 jin.

	2. To adapt to the actual economic difficulties of students, if it is indeed necessary to increase the percentage of students receiving grants, it may be appropriately increased with the approval of the Bureau of Education. However, private secondary schools shall not exceed 10% of the total number of students in all private secondary schools in the city (calculated by converting 70 jin of millet into one person); municipal secondary schools shall not exceed 20% of the total number of students in all municipal secondary schools in the city (calculated by converting 70 jin of millet into one person); municipal technical schools shall not exceed 50% of the total number of students in all municipal technical schools in the city (calculated by converting 70 jin of millet into one person).

	3. The purpose of the government in establishing people's grants is to solve the learning problems of poor students. In the past, some schools placed equal emphasis on poverty, student attitude, and service spirit when reviewing grants, which was inappropriate. In the future, the degree of poverty should be the basic standard for review, in accordance with the spirit of the government's establishment of grants; other points can only be used as reference materials.

	4. In the past, the school review committees of some schools were not responsible enough, and simply relied on the evaluations of student groups in each class as a decision, resulting in many deviations. In the future, the school review committees should be practically responsible for the review. Student groups can provide opinions from various aspects as a reference for the school review committee, but after the school review committee makes a decision, it should announce the results to solicit student opinions; if students have no objections, it should be reported to the Bureau for review.

	5. The application procedures for people's grants should be simplified as much as possible. The school review committees of each school should prevent the malpractice of genuinely poor students losing the opportunity to apply for and receive grants due to slight non-compliance with the application procedures.

	6. In the past, it was originally stipulated that people's grants would be reviewed once per semester. Considering that students' economic conditions have generally not improved, this semester, all old students who have already received grants (including new students who have been promoted or transferred to various schools under the jurisdiction of the city) will generally not be re-examined (a small number of individual students who need to be re-examined due to changes in their economic conditions are not included in this example), and grants will still be issued according to the original grade. Each school should make three copies of the list of these students, and attach the proof of grant received issued by the original school, and report it to the Bureau before September 3, so that the September grant can be issued as soon as possible.

	7. New and old students who are newly applying for people's grants can start the application procedures after the start of the school year. Each school should seize the time to conduct investigations and understand the situation from various aspects, and complete the review by September 20, and submit the application forms and certificates to the Bureau of Education to strive for review and decision by the end of September, so that the October grant can be issued in a timely manner. As for individual extremely poor students who need to receive the September grant immediately, the principal or school review committee of each school may be responsible for controlling and deciding on the appropriate grade of grant for these students, and submit a simple list (only stating the student's name, grade, and grant grade) with a promissory note from the school to the Bureau of Education before September 5, and the September grant can be borrowed and issued. After the Bureau of Education reviews and approves, three copies of the list will be submitted for regular reimbursement.

	8. After this, if the grant grade of individual new and old students is inappropriate, or if there are other individual new applicants, each school should sign specific comments on each student's application form between the 20th and 23rd of each month and report it to the Bureau for review, and submit a list of students approved to receive grants to the Bureau of Education before the 25th of each month for collection and distribution of funds.

### 京市文教局制定办法  修正中学助学金制度  乙丙两等均稍为提高

　　京市文教局制定办法
    修正中学助学金制度         
    乙丙两等均稍为提高
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市文教局对本市公私立中等学校学生人民助学金的等级米数，享领学生百分数、审核标准以及申请手续诸方面，顷根据目前政府财政力量及各有关单位的改进意见，确定了以下几项修正办法；并已指示各校于九月份起，遵照实行。
    一、为了改善学生伙食，以促进健康，人民助学金的三种等级米数，除甲等仍维持七十斤不变外，乙等由五十斤提高为六十斤，丙等由三十五斤提高为四十斤。
    二、为适应学生经济困难之实际情况，如确实需要提高享领助学金学生百分数时，经文教局批准后，可适当提高，但私立中等学校不得超过全市私立中学学校学生总人数的百分之十（以领满七十斤小米折成一个人计算）；市立中学不得超过全市市立中学学生总人数的百分之二十（以领满七十斤小米折成一个人计算）；市立技术学校不得超过全市市立技术学校学生总人数的百分之五十（以领满七十斤小米折成一个人计算）。
    三、政府设置人民助学金的目的是为了解决贫寒学生的学习问题。过去，对于助学金的审核，有些学校将贫寒情况、学生态度、服务精神三个条件并重，这是不妥当的。今后，应本政府设置助学金的精神，以贫寒程度为审核的基本标准；其他各点，只能作为参考材料。
    四、过去，有些学校的校审会不够负责，单凭各班学生小组评议即作为决定，以致发生很多偏差。今后，校审会应切实负责审核，学生小组可多方面提意见，作为校审会参考，但校审会于审核决定后，应将结果公布，听取学生意见；若学生对此没有异议，即报局复审。
    五、人民助学金之申请手续，应力求简化，各校校审会应防止由于申请手续略有不符而使真正贫寒的学生失去申请、享领助学金机会的流弊。
    六、过去原规定：人民助学金每学期审核一次，鉴于学生经济状况一般未有好转，本学期，对于所有已领助学金之旧生（包括市属公私立中等学校升、转入各校之新生）一般不再重新审核，（个别少数的学生因经济条件变化而需重新审核不在此例）仍按原等级发给助学金。此种学生，各校应造册三份，并附具原肄业学校所发享领助学金之证明，于九月三日以前报局，以便尽先发给九月份助学金。
    七、新申请人民助学金之旧生和新生，其申请手续于开学后即可开始办理，各校应抓紧时间，从多方面进行调查、了解，务于九月二十日审查完毕，并将申请表及证件呈报文教局争取在九月底前审核决定，以便及时发放十月份助学金，至于个别极贫寒的学生，需要立即享领九月份助学金时，可先由各校校长或校审会负责掌握，并决定此项学生应享受助学金的适当等级，在九月五日以前造具简单名册一份（只写明学生姓名、年级、助学金等级）附同学校所具借据一纸呈报文教局，可予借发九月份助学金，俟文教局审查核准后，再补送名册三份，以便接规定报销。
    八、此后，个别新旧生之助学金等级如有不适宜时，或另有个别新申请者时，各校应于每月二十至二十三日之间，在各生申请表上签注具体意见，报局复审，并于每月二十五日以前，造具准领学生的名册呈报文教局，以便汇总领款发放。
                                                     （王明）
