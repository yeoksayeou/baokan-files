Should Rectification Campaigns Be Carried Out in Schools?
    Answering Reader Zhang Di's Question

Editor,
    (1) How should we interpret "团员干部 (League member cadres) of various organizations" as mentioned in the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League's response to the Central Committee of the Communist Party's instruction on rectifying the Party and cadres?
    (2) Is it permissible to conduct rectification campaigns in schools?
                              Zhang Di, National Institute of Technology

Comrade Zhang Di:

    We have forwarded your questions to the General Office of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League for answers as follows:

    (1) "League member cadres of various organizations" mentioned in the Central Committee of the League's instruction should be interpreted as follows: "Various organizations" refers to the leading organs of the People's Government and various people's organizations, not specifically the organs of the League; "League member cadres" refers to League members who are cadres working in the aforementioned organizations (at any level).

    (2) Schools are not organizations. Under the current circumstances, generally, rectification campaigns should not be conducted. Only League members among school staff, and individual cadres of the League who are detached from production, may participate in the rectification led by the Party when necessary, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Committee of the League. General League members in schools, including cadres such as branch secretaries and branch committee members who are not detached from production, do not participate in rectification studies.
                                                        Editor

　　学校中应否进行整风？
    答读者张棣问编辑同志：
    （一）青年团中央发布的响应中共中央整党整干指示中所提的“各机关的团员干部”，应作何解释？
    （二）在学校中，可否进行整风？
                              国立高工  张棣张棣同志：
    所询问题已由我们转请中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会办公室解答如下：
    （一）团中央指示中所提“各机关的团员干部”应作如下解释：各机关是指人民政府各机关、各人民团体的领导机关，并非专指团的机关而言；团员干部是指凡在上述机关（不论那一级）中工作的干部中的团员而言。
    （二）学校不是机关，在目前情况下，一般不应进行整风。只有学校工作人员中的团员、及个别团的脱离生产的干部，在必要时可按照团中央指示规定参加党所领导的整风。学校中一般团员，包括不脱离生产的支书、支委等干部在内，均不参加整风学习。
