[From] The Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters Communication Group reports: The Yellow River is now entering the autumn flood season, and the downstream provinces of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong are intensifying the rectification and inspection of various preparations for flood prevention. Currently, 303 flood control organizations at all levels have been established in downstream areas; the number of people participating in flood control organizations, such as long-term flood control personnel, temporary flood control personnel, rescue teams, and reserve team members, totals more than 270,000; 3,157 ships participating in rescue, emergency repair, and transportation have been organized; material preparation has been inspected and allocated, and can generally guarantee timely supply; at the same time, publicity and struggle against complacency have been launched; and several inspections and repairs of the dike lines have been carried out to eliminate hidden dangers in the dikes. This is the result of more than two months of flood control preparation work in the Yellow River. However, there are still some shortcomings in mobilizing the masses and eliminating hidden dangers:

Due to the huge dike restoration and risk management projects carried out last winter and this spring, the dikes and embankments are higher and stronger than in the past, especially after overcoming last year's unprecedented flood, and coupled with the small flood season this year, a blind and optimistic complacency has arisen among some cadres and the masses. Although leaders in various places, especially responsible cadres in the three provinces, personally went down to supervise and inspect; and launched a universal struggle against complacency throughout the river, some villages have been able to cope with emergency rescue situations. For example, when Juancheng, Pingyuan held a rescue drill, the masses in each village immediately carried materials and tools to the dike as soon as the signal sounded. However, this type of village is not yet common. In another part of the villages, because the mobilization and organization work is not thorough enough, and because it is now the busy autumn season, the contradiction between flood prevention and production has not been resolved, and some flood prevention organizations are still somewhat formalistic. There are also some villages where the publicity and mobilization work is extremely poor, and the cadres only go to the villages to urge the collection of grass bundles and ask for lists. The situation of village cadres procrastinating and coping is also very serious. For example, the flood control organization list of some villages was made by the cadres themselves, and some people still do not know about it.

Inspecting dike lines and eliminating hidden dangers is one of the important tasks of this year's Yellow River flood control. According to incomplete statistics, in the past two months, a total of 1,906 blocked badger and fox burrows have been discovered and filled along the entire downstream line. Water gullies and wave nests were repaired. The most serious burrows, such as those in Yuanyang, Henan, were as long as 200 meters. Some burrows even ran from the dike root to the dike top, from the back of the river to the river side. Furthermore, some residents living near the dike superstitiously believe that badgers and foxes are "immortals" and want to hide the burrows. Without publicity, education and mass reporting, it is not easy to completely discover them. In addition to launching planned publicity, various reward and compensation methods for eliminating hidden dangers have been established to reward the masses for self-reporting and confidential reporting.

In order to confidently overcome possible floods, the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters has recently instructed all localities to pay close attention to changes in water conditions, strengthen dikes, and not to assume that there will be no major floods this autumn because of the special situation this year where the flood season did not leave the riverbed, thus creating complacency. Although there may not necessarily be a major flood, it is necessary to be prepared for the worst. The instructions also pointed out that the formalistic flood prevention organizations should continue to be thoroughly rectified, and strive for the balanced development of flood prevention organizations in various places; at the same time, hidden dangers in the dike lines should be continuously inspected, inspected and repaired at the same time, so as to achieve the necessary strength.

This year's Yellow River coast has seen good harvests not seen in many years, and the autumn harvest is in sight. The people along the river should be especially vigilant, resolutely overcome possible autumn floods, and protect the abundant autumn harvest.

　　迎接黄河秋汛
    豫平鲁加紧检查防汛工作
    彻底克服麻痹思想做到有备无患
    【本报讯】黄河防汛总指挥部通讯组报道：黄河正临秋汛时期，下游河南、平原、山东三省正加紧整顿、检查防汛的各项准备工作。目前下游各地已成立各级防汛组织计三百零三处；参加防汛组织的群众如长期防汛员、临时防汛员、抢险队员、预备队员等共达二十七万余人；参加救护、抢险、运输的船只已组织起三千一百五十七只；物料准备已进行检查与调配，大体能够保证及时供应；同时对麻痹思想展开了宣传与斗争；并进行了数次堤线检查与补修，消灭了堤防隐患。这是黄河两月余防汛准备工作所得到的成绩。但在动员群众中与消灭隐患上仍存在着一些缺点：
    由于去冬今春进行了巨大的复堤整险工程，堤防坝埽都比以往高大坚固，特别是战胜了去年空前的洪水，再加以今年伏汛不大，因此在部分干部群众中产生了一种盲目乐观的麻痹思想。虽经各地领导特别是三省负责干部亲自下去督促、检查；并在全河普遍的展开了反对麻痹思想的斗争，已使部分村庄能够应付紧急抢险情况。如平原鄄城举行抢险演习时，各村群众听到信号一响，即紧张携带物料工具上堤。但这类村庄，还并不普遍。另一部分村庄因为动员与组织工作不够深入，又因目前正值秋忙未能解除群众防汛与生产的矛盾，防汛组织还有些流于形式。还有一部分村庄，宣传动员做的极差，干部到村庄仅仅是催草捆、要名单。村干部拖延应付的情形也很严重。如有的村的防汛组织名单是干部自己造的，有些群众还不知道。
    检查堤线消灭隐患，是今年黄河防汛重要工作之一，据不完全统计，两月来下游全线经发现并填实的堵塞的獾狐洞穴共一千九百余个。并修补了水沟浪窝。最严重的洞穴，如河南原阳竟有长达二百公尺者。甚至有的洞穴从堤根到堤顶，从背河到临河。再有部分靠堤居民迷信獾狐是“神仙”，想隐蔽洞穴。如不经过宣传教育和群众的检举，是不易完全发现的。现除已发动有计划的宣传外，并已订立了消灭隐患的各种奖励与赔偿办法，奖励群众自报密报。
    黄河防汛总指挥部为了有把握战胜可能到来的洪水，近又指示各地，严密注意水情变化，加强堤防，不要以为今年伏汛水不出滩的特殊情形，就以为今秋再无大水，而产生麻痹思想。虽然也不一定就有大水，但必须要做到有备无患。指示又指出，流于形式的防汛组织仍应继续深入整顿，争取各地防汛组织平衡发展；同时对堤线隐患应坚持不断检查，边查边补，做到应有的坚强。
    今年黄河沿岸都是多年未有的好庄稼，秋收在望，沿河群众应特别提高警惕，坚决战胜可能到来的秋汛，保卫丰盈的秋收。
