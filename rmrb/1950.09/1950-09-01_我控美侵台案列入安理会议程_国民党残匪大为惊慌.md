　　I Accuse US Aggression Against Taiwan Case Included in Security Council Agenda
    Kuomintang Remnant Bandits Greatly Alarmed
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st] After the United Nations Security Council included our accusation against the United States' armed aggression against Taiwan on its agenda, it caused panic among the Kuomintang remnant bandits entrenched in Taiwan. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Taipei on the 30th, "The United Nations Security Council's decision to discuss the Taiwan issue has greatly surprised Taipei." According to a United Press International dispatch from Taipei on the 30th, the Kuomintang bandits painfully pointed out that the inclusion of the case accusing the United States of aggression against Taiwan on the Security Council's agenda "is a diplomatic failure for Western democratic countries" and "puts Western countries in the position of the accused."

    【新华社三十一日讯】联合国安全理事会将我国控诉美国武装侵略台湾案列入议程后，引起了盘踞台湾的国民党残匪的惊慌。据美联社台北三十日电称：“联合国安理会决定讨论台湾问题，颇使台北方面感到惊讶。”另据合众社台北三十日电，国民党匪方痛心地指出：控诉美国侵略台湾案的列入安理会议程，“是西方民主国家外交上的失败”，“使西方国家立于被告的地位”。
