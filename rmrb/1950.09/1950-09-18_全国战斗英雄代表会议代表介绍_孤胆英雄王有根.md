Introduction to Representatives of the National Combat Heroes Conference
    Lone Hero Wang Yougen

    Daringly Penetrates Enemy Lines to Seize Machine Gun

    In April 1947, the Northeast People's Liberation Army launched a major counter-offensive and surrounded the enemy in Beishan Town, Qingyuan County, preparing to annihilate them. The enemy's New Sixth Army Twenty-second Division, known as the "ace" unit, rushed to reinforce from over a hundred miles away. The first two regiments had already made contact with our army, while the enemy division headquarters, leading another regiment, was stationed in Erdaohezi, close to the highway, shrinking back and不敢前进。 Our Fourth Column Tenth Division Thirtieth Regiment was ordered to cut off the enemy's retreat by inserting itself behind them. At that time, Wang Yougen was the machine gun squad leader of the Fifth Company of that regiment.

    The enemy Twenty-second Division used a battalion of troops to control Dahua Mountain, three thousand meters high and three kilometers away from Erdaohezi, to ensure the safety of its division headquarters and transportation lines. The mountain top was full of fortifications and trenches, and the yellow grass on the front had been cut clean. To cut off the enemy's retreat, Dahua Mountain was a must-win location for us.

    Our Thirtieth Regiment Second Battalion advanced stealthily to a mountain four hundred meters from Dahua Mountain, serving as the launching point for the attack. At dawn, we launched three offensives, but the enemy, relying on Dahua Mountain's high vantage point, repelled all three. Wang Yougen's machine gun also malfunctioned. He lay in the trench, glaring at Dahua Mountain, the casualties of his comrades making him even more hateful of the enemy.

    At 2:00 PM, the Seventh Company of the Third Battalion was transferred to take on the main attack. Upon hearing this news, Wang Yougen thought to himself, "My machine gun is broken, what am I doing lying here? How can I complete my merit-making plan if I just lie here?" So he ran to the company commander and asked to charge with the Seventh Company. He said to the company commander, "More people mean more strength, let me go!"

    As the Seventh Company's charge horn sounded, Wang Yougen, carrying a rifle, charged towards Dahua Mountain with the Seventh Company. Enemy machine guns and small cannons fired madly from above, and the flanking fire from a light machine gun on the enemy's left-wing position seriously threatened our army's advance. The Seventh Company was pinned down below a ridgeline only two hundred meters from the top of Dahua Mountain. Wang Yougen crawled there, observing the terrain ahead, and discovered that a patch of yellow grass more than two chi (a Chinese unit of measurement, approximately 1/3 meter) high in front of the enemy's left-wing position had not been cut. He crawled alone into the grass towards the enemy's machine gun.

    More than twenty minutes later, Wang Yougen had crawled to within only a dozen meters of the enemy machine gun position! Enemy machine gun bullets whizzed past his head. He concealed himself beneath the yellow grass, concentrating on observing the enemy's movements, thinking about how to seize the enemy's machine gun. Suddenly, the muzzle of the machine gun tilted upwards, and the firing stopped. Wang Yougen skillfully judged that they were changing the ammunition magazine. In that split second, he calculated from personal experience that it would take the enemy at least two seconds to change the magazine. If he dashed upwards through the dozen meters of yellow grassland, he could reach it. Without hesitation, he straightened up, concentrated all his strength, and pounced on the enemy machine gun. One hand grabbed the machine gun emplacement, and the other grabbed the machine gun leg, forcefully yanking it downwards. The enemy, who was in the process of changing the magazine, was caught off guard by this sudden hero, panicking and dropping the machine gun as they ran away. At this moment, the loud charge horn sounded from the Seventh Company's position. Wang Yougen quickly jumped into the emplacement, picked up the enemy's machine gun, and, seeing many wires under a large tree, estimated that it was the enemy's command post and began to fire fiercely. In the blink of an eye, the Seventh Company also charged to the top of the mountain. The enemy abandoned a heavy machine gun and fled to another small hill.

    The high ground of Dahua Mountain, the point of contention between the enemy and us, was occupied by us! The battalion sent the order to "Hold Dahua Mountain!"

    The enemy concentrated all their artillery fire on our Dahua Mountain from another hill, and enemy planes also bombed and strafed from above, but no one paid any attention. Wang Yougen and the Seventh Company held the top of Dahua Mountain together.

    The enemy's retreat was cut off, and two regiments, more than two thousand men, of the Twenty-second Division were annihilated by us. The enemy division headquarters and another regiment in Erdaohezi abandoned two howitzers, a dozen vehicles, four armored vehicles, and dozens of heavy mortars under our army's attack and fled towards Shenyang.

    Single-Handedly Seizes Cement Bunker with Ingenuity

    By May 4th, the street fighting in Meihekou had continued for five days and four nights. The remnants of the enemy's 184th Division—a division headquarters and a regiment—were gathered in a string of red houses about two hundred meters long at the foot of Beishan Hill, stubbornly resisting with the help of the surrounding bunkers. The artillery fire from a cement bunker on the southwest corner of the red houses blocked our army's advance. At that time, the Fifth Company of the Thirtieth Regiment was assigned the task of eliminating this bunker.

    After five days and four nights of bloody fighting, although we had achieved victory, we had also paid a considerable price. The Fifth Company had only thirteen men left. They were hidden in a trench more than forty meters southwest of the cement bunker, planning to use explosives to complete this difficult task. Four comrades who were sent to deliver explosives had been suppressed by enemy fire. Two comrades sacrificed themselves in the open, and two comrades were wounded while crossing the open ground. At this time, machine gun squad leader Wang Yougen said to the company commander, "Let me go and complete this demolition task!" The company commander agreed.

    Wang Yougen took out the membership application of a comrade who had sacrificed himself from his pocket, and gave it and the machine gun parts to the political instructor. After carefully observing the terrain, he said to the political instructor, "After I leave, when you hear the whistle, use wooden sticks to hold up your hats and wave them, I have a way to approach the bunker." He took ten jin (a Chinese unit of measurement, approximately 500 grams) of explosives and four hand grenades, avoiding the front, and crawled towards the southeast side of the cement bunker. After crawling more than ten meters, his right arm was wounded. The company commander told him to go back immediately. Seeing that he was only twenty meters away from the bunker, he felt that as long as he was not dead, he should endure the greatest pain and resolutely complete the task! But the enemy's dense bullets made it impossible for him to move forward, so he blew the whistle. The comrades guarding the trench immediately used wooden sticks to hold up their hats and wave them, attracting all the enemy's fire in the bunker. Wang Yougen took the opportunity to pounce forward with great force, like a gust of wind, crossed the open ground, and approached the red houses near the bunker. He threw a hand grenade into the house, listened to see if there was any movement, and jumped into the house through the window. There were no enemies in the house.

    The west window of the house was only three meters away from the bunker. Wang Yougen leaned against the wall and observed the terrain outside the window, thinking, "If I jump out of the window to deliver the explosives, I'll either die or be wounded, and I won't be able to complete the task." He turned around and saw a long bamboo pole in the corner of the wall. He untied his leggings, tied three hand grenades to one end of the bamboo pole, and used the leggings to tie the fuse to the other end of the bamboo pole. After tying it, he quickly climbed onto the windowsill, used the bamboo pole to send the hand grenades into the gun hole on the bunker, and pulled the leggings tied to the fuse with his right hand. With a "boom," it exploded! Wang Yougen then shouted, "Come out and surrender your guns, surrendering your guns will not be killed." The panicked enemy agreed to surrender their guns. But Wang Yougen thought, if the enemy found out he was alone, not only would they not surrender their guns, but it would also be dangerous. So he cleverly shouted, "First and Second Squads, cease firing, the enemy is surrendering their guns!"

    Nine rifles, one submachine gun, and three light machine guns were thrown out of the bunker. Nineteen enemies, with their hands raised, walked towards the Fifth Company's position according to Wang Yougen's orders.

    The obstacle to the advance was cleared, and the troops continued to charge forward. At 5:00 PM that day, the enemy's 184th Division was completely annihilated by us, ending the Battle of Meihekou.

    Wang Yougen is thirty-one years old this year, born into a dirt-poor family in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province. He worked as a silk factory worker from the age of nine, and then learned carpentry at the age of nineteen. At the age of twenty-one, he was captured by the Japanese devils and taken to a coal mine in the Northeast, where he was not fed enough, did not have enough clothes, and was shackled at night after working in the mine during the day. On August 15, 1945, the Soviet Red Army sent troops to the Northeast, and Wang Yougen was liberated. Recalling the oppression he had suffered, he resolutely joined the Third Brigade of the Northeast People's Autonomous Army, which was later reorganized into the Tenth Division of the Fourth Column of the Northeast People's Liberation Army. He joined the Communist Party in November 1947. He successively served as a soldier, machine gun squad leader, platoon leader, and company commander. In January 1950, he was promoted to deputy battalion commander of the First Battalion of the 624th Regiment of our North China 208th Division.

    During the Liberation War, he participated in the Four Defenses of Linjiang, Haicheng, and the Three Defenses of Benxi, among other battles. In battle, he consistently demonstrated resourcefulness, flexibility, bravery, and composure, and performed two great feats of merit in the battles of Dahua Mountain and Meihekou.

　　全国战斗英雄代表会议代表介绍
    孤胆英雄王有根
    深入敌阵夺机枪
    一九四七年四月，东北人民解放军大反攻开始了，我三纵队包围了清原县北山城镇的敌人，准备歼灭它。敌人号称“王牌”的新六军二十二师从百里以外赶来增援，先头的两个团已与我军接触，敌师部率另一个团驻在紧靠公路的二道河子，畏缩不敢前进。我四纵队十师三十团奉命插到敌人背后切断敌人归路。那时王有根是该团第五连的机枪班长。
    敌二十二师以一个营的兵力，控制了离二道河子三里地远的，高达三千米的大华山，以保障其师部和交通线的安全。山顶上掩体、战壕布满了，正面的黄草已被割净。要想切断敌人归路，大华山即为我必争之地。
    我三十团二营隐蔽前进到距大华山四百米达的山头上，作为攻击出发地。拂晓时，我曾发动三次冲锋，敌依仗大华山居高临下，三次冲锋都未成功；王有根的机枪也发生了故障。他爬在战壕里怒视着大华山，战友的伤亡使他对敌人更加愤恨。
    下午两点钟，三营七连被调来担任主攻。王有根知道这个消息后，心里盘算：“我的机枪已经坏了，还爬在这儿作什么呢？老爬在这儿怎么能完成立功计划？”便跑到连长那里要求和七连一起去冲锋。他对连长说：“多一个人就多一份力量，让我去吧！”
    在七连的冲锋号声中，王有根端着步枪，随同七连向大华山冲去。敌人的机枪、小炮疯狂地从高处射过来，敌左翼阵地上一挺轻机枪的侧射火力，更是严重地威胁着我军的前进。七连被压缩在离大华山顶仅二百米达的棱线下面。王有根爬在那里察看着前进的地形，发现敌左翼阵地前还有一片二尺多高的黄草没割去，他便一个人钻进草里向着敌人那挺机枪爬去。
    二十多分钟以后，王有根已经爬到离敌机枪阵地仅有十几米达的地方了！敌人的机枪子弹，从他头上嗖嗖地飞过去，他把身子隐蔽在黄草下面，聚精会神地察看敌人的动作，想着如何夺取敌人的机枪。突然机枪口向上一昂，射击也随着停止下来，王有根熟习地判断出这是在换子弹梭子，而在这一霎眼的时间，他以亲身的体验计算出：敌人要换上梭子最少得二秒钟，若通过这十几米达的黄草地往上扑去也可以到达，他毫不犹疑地挺起身子，集中全力向敌机枪猛扑过去，一手搭上机枪掩体，另一手一把将机枪腿抓住，猛力地向下一夺；正换上梭子的敌人，被这个突如其来的英雄吓得手足无措，放下机枪撒腿就往回跑。这时候，嘹亮的冲锋号从七连的阵地上响起来了，王有根迅速地跳进掩体，端起敌人的机枪，望着大树下面有许多电线，估计是敌指挥所的地方，便猛烈射击；转眼间，七连也冲上了山顶。敌人扔下一挺重机枪逃向另一小山头去了。
    敌我争夺的制高点——大华山被我占领了！营里传来“坚守大华山”的命令。
    敌人在另一个山头上，集中全部炮火向我大华山射击，敌机也在上空轰炸、扫射；但人们一点也不理睬。王有根和七连在一起据守着大华山顶。
    敌人归路被切断，二十二师的两个团二千多人被我歼灭了，而二道河子敌人的师部和另一个团也在我军攻击下扔下两门榴弹炮、十几辆汽车、四辆装甲车和数十门重迫击炮，向沈阳逃走了。
    只身智取洋灰碉
    到五月四日，梅河口的巷战已经继续五天四夜了。敌一八四师残部——一个师部和一个团的兵力，集结在北山岗下边一串长约二百米达的红房子里，凭借着周围的碉堡继续顽抗。从红房子西南角上洋灰碉里发射出来的炮火，封锁了我军前进的道路。当时三十团五连担当了扫除这一碉堡的任务。
    经过五天四夜的血战，我们虽然取得了胜利，却也付出了不小的代价。五连只有十三个人了，他们隐蔽在洋灰碉西南方向四十多米达的交通沟里，计划用爆破来完成这一艰巨的任务。先后派去送炸药的四个同志，在敌人火力的压制下，两个同志牺牲在开阔地上，两个同志通过开阔地时挂了花。这时机枪班长王有根对连长说：“让我去完成这个爆破任务吧！”连长允许了。
    王有根从怀里掏出来牺牲了的同志留下的入党志愿书，连机枪零件一块交给了指导员；并且在仔细观察了地形之后对指导员说：“我走后，你们一听见哨子响，就用木棍挑起帽子摇晃，我自有办法接近碉堡。”他拿起十斤重的炸药和四颗手榴弹，避开了正面，向洋灰碉的东南面爬去，爬出十多米达远，他的右臂挂花了；连长叫他马上回去。他看到离碉堡也只有二十多米达，觉得只要没有死，就应当忍受最大的痛苦，坚决完成这一任务！但敌人密集的枪弹，使他实在无法前进，他就“嘟”的一声吹响了哨子。守在交通壕里的同志马上用木棍挑起帽子摇晃，吸引了碉堡里敌人的全部火力。王有根便乘机猛力向前扑去，像一阵风似的通过开阔地，接近了碉堡附近的红房子。他往房里扔了颗手榴弹，听了听里面没动静，便从窗户跳进屋里；屋里没有一个敌人。
    房子的西窗户离碉堡仅有三米远。王有根依着墙察看窗户外边的地形，心里想：“从窗户跳出去送炸药，不牺牲也得挂花，就完不成任务了。”他回头看见墙角那儿有一根很长的竹竿，便解下绑腿把三颗手榴弹系在竹竿的一端，又用绑腿拴住导火线拉在竹竿的另一端。绑好以后，迅速地登上窗台，用竹竿把手榴弹送进了碉堡上的枪眼里，右手一拉拴在导火线上的绑腿，“轰”的一声爆炸了！王有根接着就喊：“出来交枪，交枪不杀。”惊慌的敌人答应交枪了；但王有根想：敌人要发现自己是一个人，不但枪不交还会有危险，他就又机警地喊：“一、二班停止射击，敌人交枪了！”
    从碉堡里扔出来了九枝步枪，一枝冲锋枪，三挺轻机枪，十九个敌人举着手，按着王有根的命令向五连的阵地走去。
    前进的障碍扫除了，部队继续冲上去。当天下午五点敌一八四师被我全歼，结束了梅河口的战斗。
          ×          ×          ×
    王有根今年三十一岁，出生在浙江省杭州市一个赤贫的家庭里。自九岁就作丝厂工人，十九岁又改学木匠手艺。二十一岁被日本鬼子抓到东北去下煤窑，吃不饱、穿不暖，白天下窑作工，晚间还给带上脚镣子。一九四五年八月十五日苏联红军出兵东北，王有根解放了。他回想起所受过的压迫，毅然参加了东北人民自治军第三旅；后改为东北人民解放军四纵队十师。一九四七年十一月加入共产党。历任战士、机枪班长、排长、连长等职，一九五○年一月升任为我华北二○八师六二四团一营副营长。
    在解放战争中曾参加过四保临江、海城、三次保卫本溪等战斗，战斗中一贯地表现机智灵活，英勇沉着，在大华山和梅河口战斗中立了两个大功。
