Beijing Municipal News Agency Report:

Beijing's public enterprises universally launched production competitions in July, creating many new records in terms of increasing output, improving quality, and reducing costs. Among the larger units, the trolleybus company, the Liulihe Cement Plant, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the public bus company, the Beijing Transportation Company, the XinJian Glass Factory, and the Qinghe Woolen Mill all exceeded their production plans. The trolleybus company's repair shop achieved the most remarkable results, exceeding its plan by 64.8 percent. The public bus company and the transportation company had failed to meet their plans in May and June, but with the efforts of all employees, they finally exceeded their plans in July.

The Shijingshan Power Plant, except for its own electricity consumption, which did not meet the plan, exceeded its plan in terms of power generation, coal consumption, and repairs, and also made progress in safety. The Waterworks Company did not complete its sales volume plan, but exceeded its plan in terms of expanding pipeline users, repairs, and maintenance; the quality of the water was also improved. The Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau did not complete its plan for loading cars and being on time; in transportation, locomotive, repairs, and road maintenance, they all exceeded their plans and improved further than in June. The 70th Ordnance Factory also partially exceeded its plan and partially did not complete it.

The following seven units did not complete their production plans in July: North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory (insufficient preparation, machine malfunctions, affecting assembly work completed one day late), China People's Printing Factory (poor materials, technical problems not resolved), Changxindian Railway Factory (overfulfilled the plan for overhauling passenger cars, but did not complete the plan for dismantling and overhauling locomotives and freight cars), North China Paper Company Beijing Factory (installing new machines, modifying good paper, affecting output), Beijing Machine Factory (delayed allocation of funds from superiors, insufficient material supply), Beijing Garment Factory (task changes, plan already completed 99.2 percent), and Jingxi Coal Mine Company (mine flooding).

Among the above 18 units, 14 launched production competitions. Especially because bonuses were generally given in June, the morale of the workers was high, and most of them paid attention to creating new records by improving tools and labor organization. The trolleybus company's repair shop had 31 rationalization proposals in July. All workshops in the factory exceeded their plans. The forging workshop completed 104 percent of the tasks for both July and August in one month. Anvil worker Liu Mengxing improved tools and completed 390 percent of his plan. The civil engineering department exceeded the plan for every project completed. July is the trolleybus's "off-peak" month, but under the slogan of "turning off-peak months into good months and rainy days into sunny days," the car and road workers exceeded their plans again. After the renovation of No. 5 machine at Shijingshan Power Plant, the vibration was reduced from 0.07 cm to 0.01 cm, creating a new record since the rotor was damaged during the Japanese occupation. Gao Qingjin, the kiln fireman at the Liulihe Cement Plant, created an unprecedented record of not covering the kiln for eight hours. The Waterworks Company increased the number of bacterial tests from 28 last month to 108. The manufacturing group of the repair and casting factory did not produce a single defective product in the whole month. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant originally stipulated that scrap iron should not exceed 5 percent of output, but the result was only about 2 percent. Workers in the electromechanical group of the Mentougou Mine and the tunneling workers in the Chengzi Mine created some new records after opposing the foremen. In some units, even the administrative departments were involved in the competition craze. The cadre section of the Shijingshan Power Plant launched an efficiency competition to calculate wages, and the work efficiency was greatly improved. The accounting section and billing section of the Waterworks Company launched competitions. The billing section achieved one-day account clearing, creating a new record in the company's history.

The production competition not only increased output, improved quality, and reduced costs, but also discovered many weaknesses in the production process, promoted the reform of labor organization and the establishment of new systems and new institutions, and strengthened the consistency of the work of the Party, the government, the labor union, and the Youth League. The Changxindian Railway Factory and the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau both improved labor organization and adopted new operating methods through competition. The Shijingshan Power Plant, the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, and the trolleybus company's repair shop all established workshop propagandists, and the labor union established a reporting and summary system to strengthen leadership over production. Various units of the trolleybus company established all necessary systems in the competition. In order to ensure the progress of the competition, the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the Shijingshan Power Plant, and the trolleybus company's repair shop all signed collective contracts or contact contracts.

After the production competition was launched, all units generally felt that the inspection and statistical work was not perfect, and the publicity and mobilization work could not keep up. The labor union organization felt strenuous in organizing the competition. Some units had not yet mobilized the technical personnel very well. At the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, the design drawings of the technical department were not accurate, and the blueprints were revised many times, which affected the production progress. The production of plowshares in the factory required the processing of more than 200 because the blueprints were wrong. In some units, the competition did not become a mass movement. Many units have not yet established or improved various systems through competition. In addition, the sand turning team of the Waterworks Company reduced the quality in pursuit of quantity, and the trolleybus company's repair shop damaged two drilling machines because there was no dedicated machine responsibility system. These shortcomings should attract the attention of the leaders of each unit and be overcome in time.

　　北京市公营企业
    七月份普遍展开生产竞赛
    创造大批新纪录不少单位超过生产计划
    【京市新闻处讯】北京公营企业七月份普遍展开生产竞赛，在增加产量、提高质量、减低成本方面，创造了许多新纪录。在较大的单位里，电车公司、琉璃河水泥厂、石景山钢铁厂、公共汽车公司、北京运输公司、新建玻璃厂、清河制呢厂等七个单位，都超过了生产计划。电车公司修造厂成绩最显著，超过计划百分之六十四点八。公共汽车公司和运输公司，五六两月都没有完成计划，但是在全体职工努力下，七月份终于超过了计划。
    石景山发电厂除自用电一项没有完成计划外，发电量、煤耗、检修等项，都超过计划，安全方面也有进步。自来水公司售水量没有完成计划，扩充管线用户、检修、修配等项，都超过计划；水的质量也提高了。天津铁路局北京分局在装车和正点方面，没有完成计划；运输、机务、检修、养路等方面，都超过计划，并且比六月份又提高一步。七十兵工厂也是部分超过计划，部分没有完成。
    七月份没有完成生产计划的计有：华北农业机械总厂（准备工作不够、机器出故障、影响装配工作晚一天完成。）、中国人民印刷厂（材料不好、技术问题没解决）、长辛店铁路工厂（大修客车超过计划，拆大修机车货车没有完成计划）、华北造纸公司北京厂（按装新机器，改制好纸，影响产量）、北京机器厂（上级拨款迟到，材料供应不上）、北京被服厂（任务变动，计划已完成百分之九十九点二）、京西煤矿公司（淹窑）等七个单位。
    在上述十八个单位里，有十四个单位展开了生产竞赛。尤其是因为六月份一般都进行了奖励，所以职工们情绪高涨，大部分注意到从改良工具和劳动组织来创造新纪录。电车公司修造厂七月份有合理化建议三十一件。全厂各班都超过计划。锻工班一个月就完成七八两月任务的百分之一百零四。案工刘梦星改良工具，完成计划百分之三百九十。土木科每件工程都超过计划完成。七月是电车的背月，但车路员工在“背月变好月、雨天变晴天”的口号下，又超过了计划。石景山发电厂五号机在检修后，震动由○点○七糎降低到○点○一糎，创造了自日寇占领时转子坏后的新纪录。琉璃河水泥厂大窑看火工高庆金创造了八小时不掩车的空前纪录。自来水公司检验细菌由上月二十八次增加到一百零八次。修铸厂制造组全月没有出一个废品。石景山钢铁厂原定废铁不得超过产量百分之五，结果只占百分之二左右。门头沟矿机电组工人和城子矿掘进工人在反把头后都创了些新纪录。有的单位，连行政部门也卷入竞赛热潮中。石景山发电厂干部科展开计算工资的效率竞赛，工作效率大大提高。自来水公司会计课和计费股都展开竞赛。计费股做到一天一清帐，创造了公司有史以来的新纪录。
    生产竞赛不只增加了产量、提高了质量、减低了成本，而且发现了不少生产过程中的弱点，促进了劳动组织的改革和新制度、新机构的建立，加强了党、政、工、团工作的一致性。长辛店铁路工厂和天津铁路局北京分局都通过竞赛改善了劳动组织，采用了新的作业方法。石景山发电厂、华北农业机械总厂、电车公司修造厂都设立了车间宣传员，工会建立了汇报总结制度，加强对生产的领导。电车公司各单位在竞赛中建立了各项必要的制度。为了保证竞赛的进行，天津铁路局北京分局、石景山发电厂、电车公司修造厂等处，都签订了集体合同或联系合同。
    生产竞赛展开以后，各单位普遍地感觉到检查统计工作不够完善，宣传鼓动工作跟不上去。工会组织竞赛感觉吃力。有些单位技术人员还没有很好地发动起来，华北农业机械总厂因技术科设计图样不精确，蓝图屡次修改，影响了生产进度。该厂生产犁壁就因为蓝图错了，有二百多需要加工。有些单位竞赛没有成为群众性运动。很多单位还没有通过竞赛来建立或健全各项制度。此外，自来水公司翻沙组因为追数量降低了质量，电车公司修造厂因为没有机器专责制，损坏了两部钻床。这些缺点是应该引起各单位领导上的注意，及时予以克服的。
