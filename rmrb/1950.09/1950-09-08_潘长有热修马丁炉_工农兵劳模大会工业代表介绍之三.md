　　Pan Changyou Repairs Open Hearth Furnace While Hot
    — Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Model Workers and Soldiers, Part Three
    Lu Ning
    With the development of the national economic construction, new model workers are constantly emerging on the production front. Pan Changyou, the open hearth furnace foreman of Tianjin Steel Plant, is one of these model figures. In the face of urgent production tasks, he acted heroically, demonstrating the noble qualities of the working class.
    This year, the production task of the open hearth furnace at Tianjin Steel Plant has increased by 3.3 times compared to last year. However, in early January, the front wall of the open hearth furnace was damaged. To shorten the furnace repair time and increase production, the Soviet expert of the plant suggested changing "cold repair" to "hot repair" (Editor's note: "Hot repair" means repairing without stopping the fire, which can save the firing time for reproduction: during repair, only the fire in the furnace is turned down, and a temporary heat insulation wall is built inside the furnace with fire bricks to carry out the front wall repair work). "Hot repair" was an innovation in China. Initially, most workers did not agree, believing that in a furnace with a temperature of over 1,000 degrees Celsius, steel blocks would melt into water, and it was unimaginable to repair the furnace without stopping the fire. However, Pan Changyou, the young Communist Party member and open hearth furnace foreman, was the first to accept the advanced working method of the Soviet Union. On the one hand, he persuaded his fellow workers, and on the other hand, he took the lead in doing it, which boosted the confidence of his fellow workers.
    At 2:30 PM on January 7th, the open hearth furnace stopped steelmaking. Braving the high heat, the workers used long-handled fire shovels and large tongs to send bricks one by one into the furnace to start building the heat insulation wall. Around 10 PM, when it was about to be completed, the high heat inside the furnace melted the scrap steel under the wall, and the heat insulation wall suddenly collapsed. Everyone felt helpless, and a sense of failure grew. Foreman Pan Changyou immediately soaked his clothes and hat with water and bravely drilled into the furnace at 700 degrees Celsius to repair the wall. But as soon as he went in, his clothes were scorched and he could not breathe. He quickly retreated, wetted his clothes again, covered his face with a wet towel, and drilled into the furnace again. His heroic behavior moved sixteen workers, including Chen Zuoxiang, who also successively wet their clothes and went in to take turns repairing the wall. Staff members not on duty also helped to pass bricks. Under such tense circumstances, the heat insulation wall was successfully rebuilt in about an hour. Thus, the repair work of the front wall was successfully completed. The total furnace repair time was five-sixths less than cold repair. Due to the success of the hot repair of the open hearth furnace, 64 days of furnace repair time can be saved throughout the year, and the country can produce more than 10 million catties of millet worth of steel ingots.
    Since then, Pan Changyou's heroic deeds have inspired the entire plant and spread throughout the country. This June, he was invited as a specially invited representative to the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met with Chairman Mao, and discussed national affairs with Zhao Guoyou, Zhao Guilan and other advanced producers, which greatly improved his political consciousness.
    After returning to the plant, Pan Changyou made rapid progress. He felt the pain of having no education, so he worked hard to study at the plant's spare-time school. After work, he also carefully studied the CPPCC documents and asked people if he did not understand. He said: "If you don't study politics, you will become short-sighted." At the same time, he was more responsible for his work and worked harder to study, and his steelmaking technology has made amazing progress. He often does not leave the open hearth furnace, especially when the production task is tight or the furnace is abnormal. He carefully observes the situation of each furnace of steel, constantly analyzes and judges it, such as making slag, watching the temperature, calculating the time, and constantly exchanging opinions with engineers and workers to improve steelmaking technology. As a result of this study, his judgment ability has been enhanced. He tested several furnaces himself, and the results were very good. In the production competition, Pan Changyou paid more attention to the improvement of steelmaking technology. The successful use of magnesia tubes instead of magnesia bricks to repair the front wall by the plant, absorbing the experience of Taiyuan Steel Plant, gave him great inspiration. After research, he proposed to use iron pipes to install magnesia to build lime kilns, which can save 3,000 pieces of imported magnesia bricks each time, worth more than 100,000 catties of millet, while the life of the lime kiln is extended from 40 furnaces to 60 furnaces.
    In his work, he cares for the masses and relies on the masses. When he finds that a production team needs his assistance in its work, he patiently studies and solves it. The pulverized dolomite powder in the millstone room harms the health of the workers, so he wants to find a way to solve this problem and calls on the workers to come up with ideas together. To solve a worker's ideological problem, he patiently explained and persuaded him.
    Pan Changyou lost his father at the age of nine, and was forced to work as a child laborer in Beiyang Cotton Mill at the age of twelve. For the sake of life, he had been working as a worker in Tianjin, Shanghai and other places, suffering all kinds of oppression and pain. After liberation, he deeply realized the significance of liberation, felt that he had truly become the master of the country, and developed a love for production. His suppressed wisdom for many years gushed out like a spring. Now, this labor model and advanced producer who has created great value for the people has been promoted from an ordinary worker to the current deputy director of the steelmaking department.

　　潘长有热修马丁炉
    —工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之三
    陆宁
    随着国家经济建设的发展，生产战线上不断涌现出新的劳动模范人物。天津钢厂马丁炉领班潘长有就是这些模范人物中的一个。他在紧急的生产任务面前，奋不顾身，表现了工人阶级的高尚品质。
    今年，天津钢厂马丁炉的生产任务比去年增加三点三倍。但在一月初，马丁炉的前墙就坏了。为缩短修炉时间，增加生产，该厂苏联专家提出改“冷修”为“热修”的建议（编者按：所谓“热修”，即不停火进行修理，这样可以节省再生产时的生火时间：修理时仅将炉火关小，以火砖在炉内垒一道临时隔热墙，即进行前墙修理工作）。“热修”在中国还是创举，起初一般工人都不赞成，认为在摄氏一千多度的炉子里，钢块进去都要化成水，不停火修炉是不可想像的。但是，年青的共产党员、马丁炉领班潘长有却首先接受了苏联的先进工作方法。他一方面向说服工友们，一方面就带头动手作，鼓舞了工友们的信心。
    一月七日下午二时三十分，马丁炉停止炼钢。工友们冒着高热，先用长柄火铲和大钳子将砖一块一块送进炉里开始垒隔热墙。到夜晚十时将近垒成的时候，炉内的高热融化了墙下面的废钢，隔热墙突然倒塌了。大家都感到没有办法了，失败情绪滋长着。领班潘长有当即以水湿透全身衣帽，奋不顾身的钻进摄氏七百度的炉内，动手修墙。但刚一进去，衣服就烤糊了，也不能呼吸，他急忙退出来，再淋湿衣服，用湿手巾蒙上脸，又钻进炉去。他的英雄行为，感动了陈作祥等十六个工友，也相继打湿衣服进去，轮替修墙。不在班的职工也帮助递砖。在这样紧张的情况下，一小时左右重垒隔热墙成功。于是顺利完成了前墙的修理工作。全部修炉时间较冷修节省六分之五。由于热修马丁炉成功，全年可节省六十四天的修炉时间，为国家多生产价值一千多万斤小米的钢锭。
    从此，潘长有的英雄事绩，振奋了全厂，传播到全国。今年六月，他被邀为第二次全国政协会议的特邀代表，会见了毛主席，和赵国有、赵桂兰等先进生产者在一起，商量国家大事，大大提高了他的政治觉悟。
    回厂以后，潘长有进步得很快，他感到没有文化的痛苦，就在该厂业余学校努力学习。他工作完了还要仔细地研读政协文件，不懂就问人。他说：“不学习政治，就会变成近视眼。”同时，他对工作更加负责，更加苦心钻研，炼钢技术有了惊人的进步。他经常不离开马丁炉，特别是在生产任务较紧或炉子有不正常的时候。他细心观察每一炉钢的情况，不断加以分析判断，如造渣子，看温度，算时候，并和工程师、工友们不断交换意见，以提高炼钢技术。这样钻研的结果，他的判断能力增强了。他自己试验了好几炉，成绩很好。在生产竞赛中，潘长有更注意到炼钢技术的改进。该厂吸收太原钢厂经验，用镁砂管子代替镁砖修前墙成功后，给了他很大启示。经过研究，他提出用铁管装镁砂修砌白灰炉，每次能节省舶来品镁砖三千块，价值十余万斤小米，而白灰炉的寿命却由炼四十炉延长到六十炉。
    在工作中，他关心群众，依靠群众。当他发现某个生产小组的工作上需要他协助的时候，他就耐心的研究加以解决。碾子房熟白云石粉妨害工友健康，他就想法要解决这一问题，并号召工友们一起来想办法。为了解决一个工友的思想问题，他耐心的进行解释说服。
    潘长有九岁就没了父亲，十二岁就被迫到北洋纱厂作童工。为了生活，他一直在天津、上海等地当工人，受尽了各种压迫和痛苦。解放以后，他深切的认识到解放的意义，感到自己真正成了国家的主人，对生产发生了热爱，他多年被压抑着的智慧，就像泉水一样涌出来。现在，这位给人民创造了巨大价值的劳动模范、先进生产者，已从一个普通的工人，升为现在的炼钢部副主任了。
