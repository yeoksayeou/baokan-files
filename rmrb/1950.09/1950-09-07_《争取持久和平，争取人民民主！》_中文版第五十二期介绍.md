Xinhua News Agency, September 6th: The Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Issue No. 52 (Total No. 91) has been published.

The journal published an editorial in this issue entitled "The Great Democratic Reform in China," commenting on China's land reform. The editorial first pointed out the great historical significance of the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution. It then analyzed the characteristics of the Chinese revolution and the importance of implementing land reform. The editorial stated: The Land Reform Law drafted by the Chinese Communist Party under the leadership of the experienced Comrade Mao Zedong is an outstanding document of our time. The Land Reform Law and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report on land reform are both based on Marxism-Leninism and a concrete analysis of China's situation. The fundamental changes that China will undergo after land reform cannot be underestimated. The Chinese people will soon take a major step forward in social development. The editorial said: The impact of China's land reform on Eastern countries will be no less than the military defeat of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the founding of the People's Republic of China. The people of the East, including the great people of India, will discover from China's experience a realistic path to get rid of feudal shackles and imperialist enslavement, and they will be more inspired in the decisive struggle against the oppressors. The editorial said: The Chinese Communist Party, utilizing the rich experience of the Russian Bolsheviks and relying on Marxist-Leninist theory, is creating all the necessary conditions for the successful implementation of reforms in its practical efforts. The Chinese Communist Party, which is opening up the socialist road for the Chinese people, has united the national democratic forces to solve the task of determining the future development of Chinese history. It has consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship. Land reform will greatly strengthen the foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship - the alliance of the working class and the peasantry. The editorial pointed out: Since the Chinese Communist Party came to power, it has faced new and complex problems of national construction. To accomplish this task, all party cadres must rely more on Marxist-Leninist theory - to master the science of Marxism-Leninism more deeply. The editorial said: China's new social reforms have angered imperialism - especially American imperialism. They fear the flames of national liberation and the storm of land revolution will sweep across the East from China. What they need is a weak, feudal, and enslaved China. This is the reason why they interfere, obstruct, and plot to sabotage the new China. The editorial concluded by emphasizing that the people's China has expressed its unyielding determination to defend the freedom and independence of its motherland and to smash any adventurous moves by US imperialism. The Chinese people are turning their country into a great fortress of peace. The new Chinese people, who have won victory after years of arduous struggle, will unite with the progressive forces of the world to fight against the instigators of new wars and for lasting world peace.

This issue prominently features Stalin's "Answers to Comrades" on linguistics.

This issue also publishes an article by Shehu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Workers' Party, entitled "The Hostile Activities of the Fascist Tito Clique Against the People's Republic of Albania," and an important essay by Grotewohl, Chairman of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, entitled "On the Tasks of the National Front of Democratic Germany."

　　《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》
    中文版第五十二期介绍
    【新华社六日讯】《争取持久和平，争取人民民主!》中文版第五十二期（总第九十一期）已经出版。
    该刊在本期发表题为《中国的伟大民主改革》的社论，评论我国的土地改革。社论首先指出了中国人民革命胜利的巨大历史意义。接着分析了中国革命的特点和实行土地改革的重要性。社论称：在经验丰富的毛泽东同志领导下的中国共产党所起草的土地改革法是当今一个杰出的文件。土地改革法和刘少奇同志的土地改革报告都是以马列主义和对中国情况的具体分析为根据的。土地改革以后中国将有的根本改革是无法低估的。中国人民不久即将在社会发展上大大迈进一步。社论说：中国土地改革对于东方各国的影响，将不下于国民党反动派的军事溃败以及中华人民共和国的成立。东方人民，包括伟大的印度人民，将由中国的经验发现一条摆脱封建枷锁及帝国主义奴役的现实道路，在反对压迫者的决定性的斗争中，他们将得到更多的感召。社论说：中国共产党利用着俄国布尔塞维克的丰富经验，依靠着马列主义理论，在其实际努力中，正在创造着成功地实施改革的一切必要条件。为中国人民开辟社会主义道路的中国共产党团结了全国民主力量来解决确定今后中国历史发展的任务。它巩固了中国人民民主专政的政权。土地改革将大大地加强人民民主专政的基础——工人阶级和农民的联盟。社论指出：自中国共产党执掌政权以来，它便面对着新而复杂的国家建设问题。要完成这个任务，所有党内干部必须更加依赖马列主义的理论——更深刻地掌握马列主义的科学。社论说：中国新的社会改革已激怒帝国主义——特别是美国帝国主义。他们惧怕民族解放的火焰，惧怕土地革命的风暴会由中国吹遍东方。他们需要的是一个孱弱、封建、被奴役的中国。这就是他们干涉、阻挠和阴谋破坏新中国的原因。社论结语强调指出：人民的中国已经表示了不屈不挠的决心，去保卫自己祖国的自由、独立、粉碎美帝国主义的任何冒险举动。中国人民正在把他们的国家变成为伟大的和平堡垒。顽强战斗多年已经获得胜利的新中国人民，将与全世界进步力量团结一致地为反对新战争挑拨者，为世界的持久和平而斗争。
    本期以显著的地位刊载了斯大林关于语言学问题“给同志们的回答”。
    本期还刊登了阿尔巴尼亚工人党中央委员会书记谢胡的《法西斯铁托集团对阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国进行的敌对活动》一文及德国统一社会党中央委员会主席格罗提渥的《关于民主德国全国阵线的任务》等重要论文。
