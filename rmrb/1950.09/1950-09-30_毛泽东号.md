　　Mao Zedong Locomotive
    (Serialized Novella)

  Forty. Doing and Talking, Talking and Doing
    After the locomotive was out of sight, the two shifts went back. People followed them to their living quarters (they lived next to the locomotive depot, which was very convenient) and continued to ask questions. ...
    When the copper alarm bell rang "Dang, dang, dang," the two shifts hurried to meet the train again, inspecting and cleaning it together. Then they left the newly changed shift behind, and the other two shifts went back.
    "All three shifts of nine people treat the locomotive like their own lives!"
    "This is true responsibility!"
    Everyone in the section was talking about it.
    People didn't know each other, but they didn't need to look for each other individually. As soon as they were off duty, everyone automatically came to the dorm, crowding it.
    The whole group divided up the work and explained to everyone: what is the "contracted responsibility system"; how to "contract maintenance and inspection"; how to save not only coal but also oil; that there should be an inspection system for driver handover; that drivers can't sleep while driving; that call and response should be thorough; that they should always pay attention to the water level...
    They were very enthusiastic and tireless, talking and talking!
    Locomotive No. 1939 learned the fastest, implementing everything step by step.
    Other locomotives then followed the example of No. 1939.
    Next, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive underwent Class B and C inspections in the depot. Without washing the boiler or involving factory repair workers, the entire team completed the Class B and C inspections themselves.
    How many people were watching!
    How many people praised, envied, and were determined to follow their example.
    Some people were afraid of trouble, saying:
    "It's good, but I can't stand it!"
    Some people in the factory were also afraid:
    "If they take care of everything, our jobs are gone!"
    Sooner or later, during rest times, even while working, they explained and persuaded everyone. Among them, Shang Baoheng spoke more than anyone else:
    "The responsibility system not only covers driving, but also maintenance and inspection."
    "Without inspection and repair skills, the responsibility system is not complete."
    "For example, if something goes wrong with the train at an outside station, we can prevent an accident if we can repair it ourselves."
    "All of this is learning from the Soviet Union."
    "This is mutual help and everyone taking responsibility, not taking away anyone's job!"
    "Everyone should be loving and united, why differentiate between the factory and the operations?"...
    Doing and talking, talking and doing, Yue Shangwu disassembled the air brake for everyone to see and explained it in detail again. Even the veteran drivers were interested. Some had been driving for decades and using the brakes for decades, but they didn't even know the internal workings of the air brake. The combination of experience and theory greatly improved things. For example, using the brakes became much more sophisticated and different from before.
    This work of persuasion and guidance was arduous, but it enabled everyone to understand various issues more deeply.
    At the same time, the leaders of the section also continuously provided information on the status of each locomotive: how is No. 1939 doing, how is No. 1727 doing, how are Nos. 1290 and 1925 doing...
    This provided considerable convenience and help for the old heroes in their work. Guo Shude reminded everyone:
    "The responsibility system mainly relies on people to take responsibility. It's not enough to just talk about technology and methods; we must also instill in everyone a sense of ownership. Otherwise, they may be responsible in the depot, but irresponsible once they leave the depot!"
    He also pointed out that the work should have a focus, first focusing on several locomotives with better personnel conditions. He proposed that he himself take more responsibility for promoting No. 1939, leading one or two locomotives first, and then influencing and promoting the entire section.
    Everyone carried out the work separately according to this guideline.
    There were too few Party members in the section, only three in total. Adding their seven, there were still only ten people.
    Guo Shude was the organization committee member of the branch. He proposed at the branch committee meeting: to carry out the work, we must develop the Party more quickly and with a focus, especially by combining it with the specific task of promoting the responsibility system.
    There were nine people on locomotive No. 1939. He spoke to each of them individually and went to their homes to understand their family's living situation and specific problems.
    The information provided by the section chief was consistent with what he learned. The ideological situation of the personnel on locomotive No. 1939 was the best. He first developed three Party members among the nine of them.
    In just over a month, more than twenty Party members were developed in the entire section, and Guo Shude alone developed seven. The "three guarantees" responsibility system work was progressing smoothly.
    The responsibility system of locomotive No. 1939 was progressing rapidly. The locomotives that couldn't keep up envied them, saying:
    "Ha, it looks like the 'Mao Zedong' locomotive of Fengtai will be yours!"
    At this time, five of the nine people on No. 1939 were already Party members! (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号

  四十、做着讲着，讲着做着
    等机车走得看不见了，两班人才回去，人们就跟他们到住的地方（他们挨车库住着，很方便），继续问长问短。……
    铜警钟“当当当”一响，两班人又赶紧迎上来接车，一同检查，一同擦洗，然后留下新换上的一班，其余两班才回去。
    “三班九个人都把机车看成自己的命一样！”
    “这才是真正的负责制！”
    说这道那，全段纷纷传扬。
    对大家不认识，但不用一个个去找，一下了班，大家自动找来了，挤满了一宿舍。
    全体分工给大家讲：怎么叫包乘负责制啦；怎样包修包检啦；不光要省煤，省油又怎么省法啦；司机交接班要检查制啦；开车时不能睡觉啦；呼唤应答要彻底啦；要时常注意水表水位啦……
    非常热情，不怕劳累，讲呀！讲呀！
    一九三九号机车学习得最快，一桩一桩都照着实行起来了。
    别的机车又跟着一九三九号学。
    接着，“毛泽东号”入库乙丙检。不用洗罐的，也不用工厂修理工，全组自己把乙丙检完成了。
    多少人围着看啊！
    多少人赞美、羡慕，决心要跟着学。
    有的人怕麻烦，说：
    “好是好，就是受不了！”
    工厂也有人害怕了：
    “什么事他们都包了，饭碗砸啦！”
    早早晚晚，休息时间，甚至一面工作着一面就向大家解释，说服；这中间商宝恒比谁也讲的多：
    “负责制不光包乘，还要包修包检。”
    “不会检修，负责制就做不完全。”
    “比方车到外站出了毛病，自己能修就出不了事故。”
    “这一切都是向苏联学习。”
    “这是互相帮助，大家负责，不是砸谁的饭碗！”
    “大家都要友爱团结，分什么工厂？分什么运转？”……
    做着讲着，讲着做着，岳尚武就把风闸拆开来给大家看，又详细讲一遍，连老司机也感到兴趣了。原来有的开了几十年车，使了几十年闸，连风闸的内部也完全不明了。经验和理论一结合，就大大提高一步，比方使闸吧，就大有讲究了，和以前不同了。
    这一说服引导的工作，是费劲的，但因此更使大家了解了各种各样的问题。
    同时段领导上也不断的提供各台机车的情况：一九三九号怎么样，一七二七号怎么样，一二九○号、一九二五号又怎么样……
    这对老英雄他们的工作有不少便利和帮助。郭树德提醒大家道：
    “负责制主要靠人来负责，光讲技术和方法还不够，还要使大家树立起主人翁思想。要不，在机务段负责，出了机务段就会不负责！”
    他又指出工作要有重点，先抓住几台人员条件较好的机车进行工作。他提出自己多负责推动一九三九号，先带领起一两台，然后再影响推动全段。
    大家照着这方针分头进行工作。
    段上党员太少，一共只有三个人，加上他们七个，也不过十个人。
    郭树德是支部组织委员，他在支委会上提出：要开展工作，就要较快的有重点的发展党，特别是要结合推行负责制这一具体工作来发展党。
    一九三九号机车九个人，他挨个找他们谈，并且挨家深入到九个人的家里，了解他们家庭的生活情况和具体问题。
    段长提供的情况和他了解的情况是符合的，一九三九号机车人员的思想情况最好，他首先就在他们九个人中间发展了三个党员。
    一个多月工夫，全段发展了二十多个党员，郭树德一个人就发展了七个。三包负责制工作顺利推进着。
    一九三九号机车的负责制更是飞速进步着，赶不上的机车羡慕他们说：
    “哈，眼看着丰台的毛泽东号是你们的啦！”
    这时候，一九三九号九个人中间已经有五个是党员了！（附图片）
