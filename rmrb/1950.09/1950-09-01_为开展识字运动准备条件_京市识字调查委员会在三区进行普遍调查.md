　　Preparing Conditions for Launching a Literacy Campaign
　　Beijing Literacy Survey Committee Conducts Comprehensive Survey in Three Districts
　　[Our Newspaper] According to the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Beijing Literacy Survey Committee, taking the Third District as a pilot area, conducted a twelve-day literacy survey starting from the 11th, which concluded on the 22nd. The committee has begun statistical research and will summarize this survey work to prepare for the future launch of a literacy campaign.
　　The Literacy Survey Committee was established on the 29th of last month, composed of seventeen units, including the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Cultural and Educational Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Weng Dujian, Director of the Bureau of Culture and Education, serves as the Chairman of the Committee.
　　The survey content includes education level (illiterate, semi-illiterate, non-illiterate, and intellectuals), learning requirements, study time, and living conditions. The survey targets mainly workers, followed by government staff and young people among citizens. Workers and government staff, regardless of age, are subject to a general survey; general citizens are only surveyed among young people aged thirteen to twenty-five (the Tenth Police Station is a key survey area, and all those over thirteen and under forty-five were surveyed).
　　The survey uses methods such as filling out forms, recognizing characters, and reading. The "Literacy Test Form" is compiled using more than 1,500 commonly used characters proposed by the Central Ministry of Education. Because it is difficult to read when arranged by the difficulty of individual characters, the characters are formed into words, and the words are divided into three groups according to depth. Each group contains approximately five hundred characters. The test still uses the number of characters recognized as the standard, combined with reading and explaining Mandarin textbook passages.
　　During the survey period, in addition to giving reports at night schools and cultural centers, the Bureau of Culture and Education, Renmin University, and various cultural centers organized literary and film evenings to explain the significance of the literacy survey and the importance of learning culture to the masses.
　　The masses, especially the working people, generally welcomed this literacy survey. They actively asked, "When will we start learning?" One housewife ran to Ji Gao three times to find the investigators, requesting to learn. Many people who exceeded the survey age also requested to learn, saying, "I am older, but I can still learn to read!" The work also received a lot of help from the masses.
　　More than 1,300 teachers from universities, middle schools, primary schools, and night schools, as well as university and middle school students, participated in the survey work. Their work enthusiasm has always been very high; at the same time, they have also improved themselves through this survey work.
　　However, there are still some shortcomings in this work, mainly: the "literacy list" is too long, the publicity is not deep enough, and the preparation is insufficient.

　　为开展识字运动准备条件
    京市识字调查委员会在三区进行普遍调查
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处讯：北京市识字调查委员会自十一日起，以第三区为试验区，作了十二天的识字调查工作，已于二十二日结束。该委员会已开始进行统计研究，并将这次调查工作进行总结，以为将来开展识字运动的准备。
    识字调查委员会是上月二十九日成立的，由市文教局、市总工会文教部等十七个单位组成。由文教局翁独健局长任主任委员。
    调查内容包括文化程度（文盲、半文盲、非文盲及知识分子）、学习要求、学习时间及生活状况等。调查对象以工人为主，其次是机关工作人员和市民中的青年。工人和机关工作人员不分年龄，进行普查；一般市民则只调查十三岁至二十五岁的青年（第十派出所为重点普查区，十三岁以上，四十五岁以下的都进行了调查）。
    调查是采用填表、认字、阅读等方式。“识字测验表”是用中央教育部所提出的一千五百多个常用字编成的。因按单字难易排列不好念，把字组成词，把词按深浅分为三组。每组约五百字左右。测验时仍以认字多少为标准，同时配合以阅读和讲解国语课文。
    调查期间，除在夜校、文化馆进行报告外，并由文教局、人民大学及各文化馆组织文艺、电影晚会，向群众解释识字调查的意义和学习文化的重要。
    这次的识字调查，群众，尤其是劳动人民，普遍表示欢迎。并积极问“什么时候开始学习？”有一位家庭妇女曾三次跑到冀高去找调查员，要求学习。很多超过调查年龄的人也要求学习，他们说：“我年岁大些，但学认字还行呀！”在工作进行中也得到了群众很多帮助。
    参加调查工作的大、中学生，及中、小学、夜校的教员共一千三百多人。他们的工作热情始终很高；同时通过这次调查工作的锻炼，也提高了自己。
    但是，这次工作中，仍有一些缺点，主要是：“识字表”太长，宣传不够深入，和事前准备不够。
