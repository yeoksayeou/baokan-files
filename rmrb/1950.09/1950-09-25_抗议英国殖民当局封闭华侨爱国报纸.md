　　Protest Against the British Colonial Authorities' Closure of Patriotic Overseas Chinese Newspapers
    The British Far East colonial authorities have recently committed a series of unfriendly acts towards the Chinese people. The British colonial authorities in Singapore and Penang have recently and unreasonably closed the patriotic overseas Chinese newspapers "Nanyang Siang Pau" and "Modern Daily." Prior to this, incidents of British colonial authorities closing schools of our overseas Chinese, arresting or deporting our overseas Chinese have occurred continuously. It is clear that the British colonial authorities' taking such barbaric and unreasonable hostile actions against our overseas Chinese is planned. This is intolerable to the Chinese people.
    Nanyang Siang Pau and Modern Daily have always adhered to the democratic unity of overseas Chinese society, introducing the situation of the motherland, and not interfering in local political struggles. However, the British authorities in Singapore have constantly threatened and persecuted them, which is completely unreasonable! In March of this year, the British authorities in Singapore arrested Zhu Qizhuo, the advertising department director of Nanyang Siang Pau, because they failed to force the newspaper to publish advertisements that slandered the people of Malaya; when closing the newspaper this time, they unreasonably detained the general manager and editor-in-chief of the newspaper. We must lodge a serious protest against the British colonial government's increasingly intensified barbaric act of undermining the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.
    Nanyang Siang Pau and Modern Daily are deeply welcomed by the local overseas Chinese and the number of readers is increasing day by day. The British colonial authorities unreasonably closed the two newspapers in an attempt to cut off the news between our overseas Chinese and the motherland, so that the imperialists can carry out various deceptive propaganda and ideological enslavement. This conspiracy is very despicable and foolish. It can only make our overseas Chinese further recognize the ugly face of the British colonialists and further increase the love of our overseas Chinese for the motherland. The Chinese people will never sit idly by and watch our compatriots suffer such abuse and humiliation for a long time. We resolutely demand that the British colonial government immediately lift the closure of Nanyang Siang Pau and Modern Daily, immediately release the arrested personnel, and protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese.

　　抗议英国殖民当局封闭华侨爱国报纸
    英国远东殖民当局近来又连续发生对中国人民不友好的行为。在新加坡和槟榔屿的英殖民当局最近竟无理封闭华侨的爱国报纸《南侨日报》和《现代日报》。在此以前，英国殖民当局封闭我国侨民的学校，逮捕或驱逐我国侨民的事件曾不断发生。英国殖民当局对我国侨民采取这样蛮横无理的敌对行为显然是有计划的。这是我国人民所不能容忍的。
    南侨日报和现代日报，素来坚持华侨社会的民主团结，介绍祖国情况，并不介入当地的政治斗争。但是，新加坡的英国当局却不断威胁与迫害它们，这是毫无道理的！今年三月，新加坡英国当局曾因强迫南侨日报刊载污蔑马来亚人民的广告没有达到目的，就逮捕了该报广告部主任朱奇卓；此次于封闭该报时，又无理拘押了该报的总经理、总编辑。我们对于英国殖民政府这样变本加厉地摧残华侨正当权益的横暴行为，要提起严重的抗议。
    南侨日报和现代日报深受当地侨胞的热烈欢迎，读者日益增多。英国殖民当局无理封闭两报，企图使我国侨胞和祖国消息隔断，以便帝国主义者进行各种欺骗宣传与思想奴役，这种阴谋是十分卑劣的和愚妄的，它只能使我国侨胞更进一步认识英国殖民者的丑恶面目，更增加我国侨胞对于祖国的热爱。我国人民决不能坐视侨胞长期遭受这样的虐待与凌辱的。我们坚决要求英国殖民政府迅速解除对南侨日报和现代日报的封闭，立即释放被捕人员，保障华侨的正当权益。
