　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd. Railway workers in Linjiang County, Liaodong Province, have quickly repaired and put back into operation two locomotives damaged by American aircraft near Linjiang. As soon as the American planes flew away after strafing on the 27th, the railway workers immediately rushed to repair the damaged locomotives. They removed the burning coals from the locomotive boilers to prevent damage to the machinery and quickly extinguished the fires in the passenger cars. The workers from the locomotive depot who were on holiday on Sunday also immediately joined the repair effort upon seeing that the locomotive had been damaged by the American planes. The No. "268" locomotive, which was damaged near the Dalizi Station, was repaired by 2 p.m. that same day and departed for Tonghua at 6 p.m. The No. "1147" locomotive, which was damaged near the Linjiang Station, was also repaired and put back into operation on the 28th after an all-night rush job. The driver, Xu Guochen, whose left hand was blown off by American planes, accepted the decision of his superiors to go to Tonghua for treatment. As he boarded the train, he said to his fellow workers, "You all work hard, use our strength, work actively, and resolutely take revenge!" All the workers replied in unison, "You are a good example, we will definitely learn from you! We will definitely take good care of your family as well."

　　铁路员工紧急抢修
    被美机打坏的机车已有两辆修好开行
    【新华社沈阳二日电】辽东省临江县的铁路员工，已将在临江附近被美国飞机打坏的两辆机车迅速修好开行。当二十七日美机扫射后刚一飞走时，铁路员工便立即抢修被破坏的机车。他们把机车锅炉中的火块取下，以免烧坏机器，并迅速将客车的火头扑灭。正在星期日休假的机务段工友看到美机把火车头打坏，也都马上参加抢修。在大栗子站附近被打坏的“二六八”号机车在当天午后二时就已修好，并在午后六时开往通化。在临江车站附近被击坏的“一一四七”号机车经过彻夜赶修，到二十八日亦修好开行。被美机打掉左手的司机徐国臣接受上级决定，到通化去治疗。他在上火车的时候，还对工友们说：“你们好好干吧，把咱们的力量拿出来，积极工作，坚决报仇！”全体工友们一齐回答说：“你是好样的，我们一定向你学习！我们也一定好好地照顾你的家属”。
