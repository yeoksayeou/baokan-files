　　Labor Models from Various Factories and Enterprises Express Determination to Increase Production and Stop American Imperialist Aggression

[Reported by this newspaper] Labor models from various factories and enterprises in Beijing expressed their unanimous anger and protest against the aggressive and provocative actions of American planes twice invading our Northeast airspace and killing and wounding our peaceful residents. They have issued the following statements:

Li Jinquan, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant: We resolutely support the government's solemn protest to the United States demanding immediate punishment of the murderers and compensation for the losses. We are a peace-loving country and oppose any aggression, but if anyone bullies us, we will certainly not agree. We are not afraid of the bluster of paper tigers. If the American imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression against us, I am willing to go to the front lines and fight them to the death.

Zhang Fengquan, Agricultural Machinery General Factory: As soon as this matter was announced, our group began to discuss it, and everyone was very angry. This incident clearly shows that American imperialism is our great enemy. In addition to actively producing and supporting the People's Liberation Army to stop American imperialist aggression, we also express our condolences to the families of the compatriots who were killed and to the injured compatriots and worker brothers.

Hou Deyuan, Beijing Telecommunications Bureau: American imperialism is already at the end of its rope. It has continuously sent planes to invade our Northeast airspace and strafe peaceful residents, thinking that this would scare the Chinese people. But the Chinese people have stood up, and we are not afraid of them. We must concentrate all our strength to avenge our dead compatriots!

Hu Quanggui, Trolleybus Company: There are already more than one hundred labor models in various factories in Beijing, which shows the strength of our production capacity. If the American imperialists dare to launch a war of aggression against our country, we will certainly be able to defeat them.

Liu Dezhen, Shijingshan Power Plant: American imperialism is invading Taiwan and Korea, and also strafing and killing our Northeast people. This fully proves that it is provoking war. We must motivate all the workers in the factory to work hard to increase production and use practical production actions to support the front lines, liberate Taiwan, and not allow American imperialists to interfere in Asian affairs.

Wang Zhonghe, Beijing Automobile Repair Factory: American imperialism used to help the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang and killed millions of Chinese people, but it failed. It is still not reconciled. Now that the People's Republic of China has been established, it is using brutal methods to kill our people. This makes us understand that American imperialism is our mortal enemy. The task of our worker brothers is to engage in production. In the future, we will only use our brains more, improve our tools, do a good job in production, support the People's Liberation Army at the front, drive the American imperialists out of Taiwan, and avenge our dead and wounded brothers.

Chen Jingheng, Seventy Ordnance Factory: We were very angry when we saw the news in the newspaper. Our job is to repair and manufacture guns and cannons. In the future, we must improve our production efficiency and quality and strengthen our national defense capabilities. Although American imperialism is brutal, it cannot scare us. On the contrary, it can only make us more united to stop aggression and eliminate war.

　　各工厂企业劳动模范表示决增加生产制止美帝侵略
    【本报讯】北京市各工厂企业的劳动模范对美国飞机两度侵入我国东北领空，杀伤我国和平居民的侵略挑衅行为，一致表示愤恨和抗议，纷纷发表谈话如下：
    石景山钢铁厂李金泉：我们坚决拥护政府向美国所提出的立刻惩办凶手、赔偿损失的严正抗议。我们是爱好和平的国家，反对任何侵略，但谁要是欺负到我们头上，我们一定不答应，我们决不怕纸老虎的威风。如果美帝胆敢对我们发动侵略战争，我愿意上前线和它们拚命。
    农业机器总厂张凤泉：这件事刚一发表，我们小组就展开讨论，大伙很发火。从这件事上，更显明的表现出美帝国主义是我们的大敌人。我们除了积极生产、支援解放军制止美帝的侵略外，并对被打死的同胞的家属及被打伤的同胞和工人弟兄表示慰问。
    北京电信局侯德原：美帝已经日暮穷途，他连续派飞机侵入我东北领空，并向和平居民扫射，以为这样就可以把中国人民吓倒，但是中国人民已经站立起来了，我们是不怕他的，我们要集中一切力量来为死难同胞复仇！
    电车公司胡泉桂：北京市各工厂已经有了一百多劳动模范，这说明我们生产力量的强大。美帝假如胆敢对我国发动侵略战争，我们一定可以打垮他。
    石景山发电厂刘德珍：美帝侵略台湾、朝鲜，又扫射杀伤我们东北人民，这完全证明他是在挑拨战争。我们要带动全厂工友，努力提高生产，用实际生产行动来支援前线，解放台湾，不让美帝干涉亚洲的事务。
    北京汽车修配厂王忠和：美国帝国主义过去帮助蒋介石匪帮，杀了几百万中国人，结果，失败了；还不死心。现在中华人民共和国成立了，他又使出残暴手段，杀害我们人民，这就使我们明白，美国帝国主义是我们的死对头。我们工人弟兄的任务是搞生产，今后我们只有更加开动脑筋，改进工具，把生产工作弄好，支援前方解放军，把美帝从台湾打跑，替我们死伤弟兄报仇。
    七十兵工厂陈景珩：我们看到报上的消息，非常愤恨。我们的工作，是修造枪炮，今后我们一定提高我们的生产效率和质量，加强我们国防力量。美帝国主义虽然残暴，但吓不倒我们，相反的，只能使我们更加团结起来，制止侵略，消灭战争。
