　　Heroes' Determination to Defend Peace
	-- A Record of Combat Heroes' Representatives Participating in Peace Signatures
	By Our Correspondent Zhu Bo

	Red sunlight illuminated the square where combat heroes gathered, and bright red flags fluttered in the wind. As the majestic military music began, the more than three hundred combat hero representatives gathered in the people's capital, in order to express their determination to defend the motherland and world peace, signed the Peace Declaration with names deeply respected by all the Chinese people.

	The heroes were so excited and so determined, embracing the feeling of writing a letter of determination on the battlefield, and once again writing down an oath to eliminate the instigators of aggressive wars with their strong and powerful arms.

	Combat hero Li Guoying said very excitedly: "I am extremely angry about the series of war-provoking facts, such as the US imperialist aggression against Korea and our Taiwan, the bombing of Andong, and the attacks on our merchant ships! I guarantee that all the commanders and fighters of our battalion are determined to fight to defend the motherland's territory, defend world peace, and eliminate the invaders." Female combat hero Guo Junqing said while signing: "This is my determination to oppose US imperialist aggression. In order to defend our territory, I will pick up my gun again and go to the battlefield." The one-armed blasting hero, Chai Xuejiu, the battalion commander of an engineering unit, wrote his name with his glorious left arm, saying, "Although I have lost one arm, this arm I have left has defeated countless enemies in the past eight or nine years. It will join with the thousands upon thousands of powerful arms of all of China to jointly eliminate the aggressive acts of US imperialism." Combat hero Kong Xiangyuan from North China said: "I always remember that we are always a fighting team. If the US imperialist war-mongering clique is not eliminated, I will not lay down my gun for a single day." Model medical worker Li Landing said: "In the cause of defending the motherland and the peace of all mankind, we have many things to do. I guarantee that our surgical team will go wherever Chairman Mao orders us to go; and we must always ensure the health of all the commanders and fighters of our troops." Navy representative Sui Shude said: "The Chinese Navy will resolutely defend the motherland's ocean. If US imperialism dares to fire a single cannonball at us, we will retaliate with thousands of cannonballs. We are determined to completely defeat the US Seventh Fleet that is invading our Taiwan." Another navy representative, Lu Xiangshi, wrote on the Peace Declaration: "We are peace-loving people, we are the People's Navy under the leadership of Chairman Mao. All war-mongers who disrupt peace and invade our territory will be defeated by us." Air Force representative Chi Shaohua wrote this when signing: "Our victories were all won with blood and sweat on every inch of our land. We will never allow US imperialism to invade." The combat heroes, militia heroes, and model workers of the troops from various military regions and field armies, representing the five million-strong army of China, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have not only learned how to achieve victory through long-term revolutionary war training, but also understand how to win peace. They will lead and unite the five million-strong army and all the Chinese people to bravely resist the invaders. Let that small handful of war-mongers who conspire to launch wars tremble in the face of the heroes' determination to defend peace! Peace and victory belong to the peace-loving heroes and people.

　　英雄们保卫和平的决心
    ——记战斗英雄代表参加和平签名
    本报记者  朱波
    红色的阳光照耀着战斗英雄们聚会的广场，鲜红的旗帜迎风飘扬，当雄壮的军乐起奏时，集结在人民首都的三百多名战斗英雄代表们，为了表示保卫祖国、保卫世界和平的决心，在和平宣言上签上了全中国人民受戴的名字。
    英雄们是那样激动，那样坚决，抱着像在战场上写决心书的心情，用那粗壮有力的手臂，再一次为消灭侵略战争发动者写下誓词。
    战斗英雄李国英非常激动地说：“对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜和我国台湾、轰炸安东、袭击我国商船等一连串的挑动战争的事实，我愤恨极了！我保证我们全营指战员，决心为保卫祖国领土，保卫世界和平，消灭侵犯者而战。”女战斗英雄郭俊卿在签名时说：“这是我反对美帝侵略的决心。为了保卫我们的国土，我要重新拿起枪来走上战场。”独臂爆破英雄、某部工兵营长柴学久，用他光荣的左臂写下自己的名字，他说：“我虽然失掉了一条手臂，但是我剩下的这一条手臂，八九年来战胜了无数的敌人，它将和全中国千千万万有力的手臂，共同消灭美帝国主义的侵略行为。”华北区战斗英雄孔祥元说：“我常常记着，我们永远是一个战斗队，美帝好战集团一天不消灭，我将一天不放下枪杆。”模范医务工作者李蓝丁说：“在保卫祖国和全世界人类的和平事业中，我们有很多的事情要做。我保证我们的手术队，在毛主席的命令下，叫到那里，就到哪里；还要时时保证我们部队全体指战员身体的健康。”海军代表隋树德说：“中国海军将坚决保卫祖国的海洋。美帝国主义如果胆敢向我们射击一发炮弹，我们将以千万发炮弹来还击它。我们决心要把侵略我国台湾的美帝第七舰队，彻底击溃。”另一位海军代表陆相时在和平宣言上写着：“我们是喜爱和平的人民，我们是毛主席领导下的人民海军，一切破坏和平、侵略我国领土的战争贩子，将被我们打垮。”空军代表迟绍华在签名时这样写着：“我们的胜利，都是在我们的每一寸国土上，用血汗换来的。我们决不允许美帝来侵犯。”代表全中国五百万大军的各军区、各野战军的战斗英雄、民兵英雄和部队模范工作者们，他们在中国共产党的领导下，经过了长期的革命战争的锻炼，不仅学会了怎样取得胜利，而且懂得了如何才能赢得和平。他们将带领着和团结着五百万大军与全中国人民，英勇地抗击进犯者。让那一小撮阴谋发动战争的战争贩子面对着英雄们保卫和平的决心发抖罢！和平与胜利是属于爱好和平的英雄和人民的。
