　　Mao Zedong Locomotive (Medium-length Serial)
    Written by Ding Kexin and Qingying, Illustrated by Zhuang Yan
            Seventeen. A Minor Storm
    The Lunar New Year was approaching, and the old hero was worried about the difficulties at home. Moreover, neighbors had also asked him for favors, so he bought some rice from Yimianpo.
    This violated the rule against “private trading” and was confiscated by the disciplinary squad.
    The news spread immediately.
    People said:
    “How could the old hero do such a thing?”
    Some said more playfully:
    “The responsibility system is a model, and so is smuggling.”
    “Let’s follow the old hero’s example.”
    The fellow workers on the locomotive were dissatisfied with him because this incident affected the reputation of the entire “Mao Zedong Locomotive.”
    Shang Baoheng and Zheng Dugong had long been unhappy that the higher-ups always praised the old hero's contributions whenever the "Mao Zedong Locomotive" was mentioned. For days, they had felt resentful. "We all put in the effort, but the credit goes to him alone!" The rice incident added fuel to the fire, and they became even more prejudiced against the old hero, showing contempt for him in every way and bickering with him about everything.
    Li Yong himself also felt a knot in his heart. The disciplinary squad told him, “You are the locomotive leader, and you are the locomotive chief. How can we do our work if we don’t confiscate it?” To take care of his difficulties, the union had negotiated with the disciplinary squad and returned half of the rice to him, but he was still unhappy, and the knot in his heart remained tightly tied. He went to the union and said, "I'm not the only one buying rice. The disciplinary squad didn't announce in advance that they would confiscate it... The Communist Party is good in every way, but it is too impersonal and doesn't solve problems." Moreover, he felt that his comrades were unsympathetic to him, lacked the spirit of mutual assistance, and were deliberately embarrassing him. He became even more angry and put on a stern face for everyone.
    One day, Shang Baoheng was off duty and burned all the coal in the dormitory car. When the old hero returned from his run and looked around, he erupted:
    "Only warming yourself and not carrying coal, the Mao Zedong Locomotive doesn't need this kind of person."
    Old Shang had never argued with the old hero before, always out of respect, but this time he retorted:
    "Don't need me? I can find a bowl of rice to eat anywhere!"
    Then the two argued for a few more sentences, and Zheng Dugong chimed in to support Old Shang:
    "Old Shang, don't be driven mad by greed, or you'll really die in vain!"
    The old hero trembled with anger. He knew that Zheng Dugong was scolding him to his face. "Old Shang is alone, not hungry after he is full, how can he be greedy?" But he did not say it out loud, but really wanted to cry in his heart: "What hatred do I have with you, Old Zheng? Why are you making it so hard for me?..."
    Another time, while running to Xinxiangfang Station, five new small sleeves of the connecting rod were replaced, and they were very hot. The old hero asked Zheng Dugong and Sun Changxin to get off the locomotive to oil them again. — They were running an interval freight train, stopping at every station, dropping off and picking up cargo, and needing to get off to oil at every station. The weather was too cold, and their hands and feet would freeze when they got off the locomotive to oil, so they had to go down at every station. Zheng Dugong was very unhappy and pouted his lips high. The old hero continued to urge him. He couldn't bear it any longer and cursed:
    "Damn it, are you treating me like a monkey!"
    This time, the old hero's face changed as soon as he heard it:
    "Who are you cursing?"
    "Whoever hears it, hears it!"
    The old hero's hands were shaking, and his throat was smoking:
    "You can't curse people!"
    Saint didn't care at all:
    "I'm just cursing people, what can you do to me?!..."
    Sun Changxin saw that the old hero's temper had become too irritable recently, and was also somewhat resentful of the old hero due to the whispering influence of Old Shang and Old Zheng, so he stood aside and watched, without trying to mediate. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号（中篇连载）

            十七、小小风波
    旧历新年快到了，老英雄惦记着家里的困难，又赶上邻居们也托他，有一次就从一面坡买回了一些大米。
    这是违犯“不准私做买卖”的规章的，被纠察队没收了。
    这消息马上传了出去。
    人们都说：
    “老英雄怎么干这种事？”
    有的说得更俏皮：
    “负责制是模范，走私也是模范。”
    “向老英雄看齐呀。”
    同车的工友因为这事影响“毛泽东号”全体的名誉，都对他不满意。
    商宝恒和郑笃恭，为了上级一提到“毛泽东号”就夸老英雄有功，好些日子本来就很不痛快，他们在背后嘀咕：“咱大伙卖了力气，功劳都是他一个人的了！”再遇上大米的事，就像火上浇油，更对老英雄抱上了成见，处处表示看不起他，件件事情跟他闹蹩扭。
    李永自己呢，心里也挽上了疙瘩。纠察队对他说：“你们是机车领袖，你又是机车长，要不没收以后怎么做工作？”工会为了照顾他的困难，和纠察队商量好把大米退给了他一半，他还是不痛快，心里疙瘩挽得死死的。他找到工会说：“买大米的不止我一个，纠察队事先也没有宣布要没收……共产党什么都好，就是太不讲情面，不解决困难。”而且认为同伴们对他不同情，是没有互助精神，故意打他的脸。他就更加气忿，对大家绷起脸来。
    一天，商宝恒歇班，把宿营车上的煤烧了个净光。老英雄跑车回来，四下一看，就发作了：
    “光烤火不搬煤，毛泽东号用不了这种人。”
    老商从来没有跟老英雄吵过，总碍着面子，这回翻了：
    “不要？到哪去也能找碗饭吃！”
    接着两人又吵了几句，郑笃恭就给老商帮腔道：
    “商大车，你可别财迷疯得了气?哇，落个气死可真冤！”
    老英雄气得打着哆嗦。他知道郑笃恭是当面骂他。“老商光杆一个，吃饱了一家子不饿，有什么财迷疯？”可是他没有说出来，心里却真想哭：“我跟你老郑有什么仇？你给我这样过不去？……”
    又一次，跑车到新香坊站，连接棒新换了五个小套，热得很厉害了，老英雄又叫郑笃恭、孙长信下车给油。——他们跑的是区间货物列车，站站要停，甩挂装卸，站站要下车给油。天气太冷，下车给油手脚冻得难受，因此每一站都要他们下去。郑笃恭就很不高兴，把嘴噘得天高。老英雄又继续催他。他实在耐不住了，就破口大骂：
    “他妈的，把老子当猴儿耍哪！”
    这回老英雄一听就变了脸：
    “你骂谁？”
    “谁听见算谁！”
    老英雄两手发抖，嗓子冒烟：
    “你骂人就不行！”
    圣人满不在乎：
    “就是骂人，你咬了我的？！……”
    孙长信见老英雄近来脾气变得太急躁，又受了老商老郑嘀嘀咕咕的影响，对老英雄也有些反感，就在一旁看着，也不去劝架。（附图片）
