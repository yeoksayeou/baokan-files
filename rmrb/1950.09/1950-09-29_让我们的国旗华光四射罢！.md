　　Let Our National Flag Shine Brilliantly!

    When the five-star red flag slowly rises on the screen, floating in the azure sky, and the narration tells us that this flag is dyed red with the blood of revolutionary fighters, it immediately evokes our memories of October 1, 1949.

    Remember how, before October 1st, a series of exciting, jubilant, and encouraging news items rejuvenated the old, transformed discord into harmony, and attracted serious adults to the front of Xinhua Gate and Tiananmen Square. Seeing thousands of young people joyfully laboring in the square to welcome October 1st, electricians installing new lines, transportation workers leveling the ground, engineers correcting the flagpole, how could people not be as happy as children; seeing the solemn emblem of the CPPCC and the eight red flags fluttering in the wind, how could people not shed tears of joy and even cry out with childlike excitement!

    Remember how, on October 1st, tears of excitement, gratitude, and pride hung on people's faces; how all kinds of tireless carnival streams flowed through the thoroughfares and alleys of the people's capital; and how the children themselves united, shouting slogans and songs in response to the marching队伍’s slogans and songs!

    On that day, people all felt an unparalleled sense of loftiness and sanctity. On that day, how many poets sang of the victory of our people's cause, and how the East and West constantly echoed, cheering and congratulating us!

    These memories are so clear and fresh, and will always be so!

    But, remember, after we slowly calmed down, after the colorful shadows of the parade and the red and green fireworks that streaked across the sky gradually faded from our vision, and after the cheers of the crowds gradually disappeared from our hearing, not long ago, Chairman Mao's words entered our minds again. He urged us:

    "The work of the past is only the first step in a ten-thousand-mile long march."

    A year has passed, Chairman Mao's words are still in our ears, and our memories are still so fresh.

    A year ago, Chairman Mao also told us: "The difficulties before us do exist, and there are many of them, but we are convinced that all difficulties will be overcome by the heroic struggle of the people of the whole country." We have not forgotten Chairman Mao's words.

    A year ago, Chairman Mao declared: "Let those internal and external reactionaries tremble before us, let them say that we cannot do this and that we cannot do that."

    Over the past year, our enemies have been coveting us from every corner, drilling and searching for faults in us, pointing out how this and that are. In their eyes, in their hopes, our republic will not exist for a single day, nor can it survive for a single day.

    However, we have not stopped standing still, we have moved forward, and our cause is attracting the attention of people all over the world. No difficulty can force us to bow our heads, because "the Chinese people already have extremely rich experience in overcoming difficulties."

    Chairman Mao is leading us to overcome difficulties and continue to move forward. Although we "have difficulties," we "have ways," so we "have hope." The people of the whole country are also advancing with Chairman Mao with such confidence.

    Today, this colorful documentary reminds us again how the Chinese people victoriously completed the first step of the Long March.

    This film wants us to cherish the fruits of victory bought with blood even more. It awakens our memories, reminding us of how we longed for October 1st, how we rejoiced, were proud, and were excited on that day, and how we felt our unparalleled loftiness and sanctity.

    In order to make that Republic's flag flying in the azure sky more vivid and brilliantly radiant, let the mood we had when the flag was raised forever reside in our minds.

    Let us unite like steel around the five-star red flag.

    For it, what shortcomings, mistakes, and selfish interests are we unwilling to discard? For it, let the patriotic sentiments of the masters replace complacency; let us wash away the dust on our faces and completely eliminate the political microorganisms in our bodies.

    For it—the five-star red flag slowly rising in Tiananmen Square—let us further muster our fighting spirit and move forward, ever forward!

    Let it be more vivid and brilliantly radiant.

### 让我们的国旗华光四射罢！

　　让我们的国旗华光四射罢！
    史米
    银幕上五星红旗徐徐上升，飘在碧空，解说辞在告诉我们这面旗帜是革命战士们的鲜血所染红时，立刻唤起我们对于一九四九年十月一日的回忆。
    还记得，十月一日以前，一连串令人振奋令人欢腾鼓舞的消息，怎样使老人变得年青，怎样使人们的嫌隙化为和谐，怎样把持重的成年人吸引到新华门前和天安门广场。看到为迎接十月一日万千青年在广场上欢乐的劳作，电工在按装新线路，交通工人在轨平场地，工程师在矫正旗杆，人们该怎样孩童般的高兴；看到政协庄严的会徽和霍霍飞卷的八面红旗，人们又怎样欢喜得流着眼泪甚至孩童似的高兴得哭出声来！
    还记得，十月一日那天，兴奋的、感激的、骄傲的，各样感情激出的泪花，怎样挂在人们的脸上；各种各样不知疲倦的狂欢的洪流，怎样走过人民首都的通衢和小巷；孩子们又怎样自己联合起来，尖着嗓子与游行队伍的口号声歌声相应和！
    那一天，人们都自己觉得是无上的崇高和圣洁。那一天，多少诗人为我们人民事业的胜利而歌颂，东方西方又怎样不断的响起回声，为我们欢呼，为我们祝贺！
    这些记忆多么清晰而又新鲜，永远是清新的呵！
    可是，还记得，在我们慢慢平静下来，那些彩色缤纷的游行队伍和划满天空的红绿焰火的影子，渐渐从我们视觉褪去之后，万众的欢呼声渐渐从我们听觉上隐去之后，不久前毛主席的一句话，又进入了我们思想中来。他叮嘱我们说：
    “过去的工作只不过像万里长征走完了第一步。”
    一年了，毛主席的话还在我们耳际，我们的记忆还是那样新鲜。
    毛主席一年前还告诉我们说：“我们面前的困难是有的，而且是很多的，但是我们确信：一切困难都将被全国人民的英勇奋斗所战胜。”毛主席的话我们没有忘记。
    一年前，毛主席这样宣告：“让那些内外反动派在我们面前发抖罢，让他们去说我们这也不行那也不行罢。”
    一年来，我们的敌人正是从各个角落向我们觊觑着，钻天觅缝的在我们身上找岔子，指点着我们这里那里如何如何；在他们眼中，在他们的希望里，我们的共和国一天也不会存在，一天也不能活下来。
    然而，我们并未停止在原地踏步不前，我们向前走了，我们的事业为全世界人们所瞩目。任何困难也莫想迫使我们低头，因为“中国人民已经具有战胜困难的极其丰富的经验”。
    毛主席正在领导着我们克服困难继续前进。我们虽然“有困难”，可是我们“有办法”，因此我们“有希望”。全国人民也正满怀着这样的信心跟着毛主席向前进。
    今天，这部五彩文献纪录片又使我们回想起了中国人民曾经怎样胜利的走完长征的第一步。
    这部片子，要我们更加珍惜用鲜血换来的胜利成果。它唤醒了我们的记忆，叫我们回想曾经怎样盼望着十月一日那一天，我们在那一天曾经怎样地欢腾过，骄傲过，兴奋过，我们曾经怎样地感觉到自己的无上崇高和圣洁。
    为了使那面飞扬在碧空的共和国国旗更加鲜艳更加华光四射，让我们在升旗当时的心情永驻在我们的思想里。
    让我们像钢铁一样团结在五星红旗的周围罢。
    为了它，我们还有什么缺点，错误和私利舍不得丢掉呢？为了它，让主人翁的爱国主义情绪来代替骄傲自满的情绪；让我们脸上的灰尘洗涤净尽，让我们肌体中间的政治微生物完全消灭。
    为了它——那面徐徐升到天安门广场上空的五星红旗，我们更加鼓起战斗精神来，向前，再向前！
    让它更加鲜艳更加华光四射罢。
