　　Rectification in the Finance Section of the Qin City People's Government:
    Focusing on Checking Grain Procurement and Other Work
    [This newspaper, Qinhuangdao News] The Finance Section of the Qinhuangdao City People's Government is carrying out rectification in light of the actual situation and has achieved preliminary results. The focus of the rectification in this section is: checking tax revenue, autumn grain procurement, wheat procurement, auditing, and other work. During the document study, groups were divided according to the situation, such as auditing, accounting, field and property, tax deeds, and administration groups. The discussions were very enthusiastic, and the发言 was also active. In the inspection work, it was initially discovered that bureaucratism existed in tax revenue, autumn grain procurement, wheat procurement, and auditing. For example, the preliminary report on wheat production in the suburbs was 96 jin per mu. Later, the Finance Section went to understand that it was 55 jin per mu. Later, together with the suburbs, it was studied that it was 70 jin per mu. But when the wheat was procured, the actual yield per mu was 85 jin. A number was changed four times because the understanding was not thorough enough. Also, in the collection of agricultural tax: due to insufficient understanding and collection of materials in advance, there were also very unreasonable phenomena in the burden situation. For example, the task assigned by Hebei Province was 60,000 jin. At that time, the leaders subjectively believed that the quantity was not large and could complete the task, and rarely went down to investigate and research. As a result, there were uneven burdens. For example, the burden on the coast was 7.4 jin per mu, while the burden in the second and third districts was only 2 or 3 jin per mu.
    In the auditing work, it was also initially discovered that there was an erroneous principle in the thinking of "never wanting to reduce the amount of money to be collected, and wanting to approve less money to be given," instead of determining it based on investigation and research. For example, the wharf police station reported a budget of 5,000 jin of rice for repairing houses, but only 3,500 jin was approved, which also enabled the plan to be completed. There was also a wasteful phenomenon where the budget approved was more than what was needed. The section is now continuing to conduct in-depth inspections based on the problems initially discovered.

　　秦市人民政府财政科整风
    重点检查征粮等工作
    【本报秦皇岛讯】秦皇岛市人民政府财政科，结合实际进行整风，初步获得了成绩。该科整风重点为：检查税收、秋征、麦征、审计等工作。在学习文件中，根据情况划分了审计、会计、田房、税契、行政等组，讨论时情绪很高，发言也踊跃。在检查工作中，初步发现：在税收、秋征、麦征、审计中均存在有官僚主义。例如郊区麦征预报每亩产九十六斤，后来财政科去了解每亩产五十五斤，后来与郊区共同研究每亩又产七十斤。但到麦征时，每亩实产八十五斤。一个数字因为了解不深入而更改了四次。又在农业税征收上：由于事先了解收集材料不够，负担情况也有很不合理的现象。如河北省布置任务为六万斤，当时领导上主观认为数量不大，能完成任务，很少到下面调查研究，结果是发生了负担上的轻重不一。如海滨每亩负担七点四斤，二、三区每亩负担只二、三斤。
    在审计工作上，也初步发现思想上存在着“要钱决不少要，给钱要少批”的错误原则，而不是根据调查研究来确定。如码头派出所修房子报预算五千斤米，只批了三千五百斤，也使计划完成了。也有的报预算批的多了而用不了的浪费现象。该科现正根据初步发现的问题，继续深入进行检查。
