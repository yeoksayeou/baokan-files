Steel Warrior Zhao Shiping
    Held Outer Trench for Eight Hours During Liberation of Linfen, Repelling Fourteen Enemy Counterattacks

    Comrade Zhao Shiping, Deputy Company Commander of a certain unit of the Second Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, who attended the First National Youth Congress, is a steel-like young combat hero. In every battle he participated in, he completed his tasks with courage and resourcefulness. In May 1948, during the liberation of Linfen, a strategically important location in southern Shanxi, he demonstrated a resolute and tenacious fighting will in capturing and defending the outer trench.

    The battle to capture Linfen's outer trench was extremely tense and dangerous. The general attack on the city was scheduled for the evening of May 17th. To ensure that the troops could successfully scale the city walls after the explosion, it was necessary to first destroy the enemy's outer trench firepower positions and occupy the outer trench. However, after days of repeated fighting, the enemy was still desperately defending it. There was an open area more than 60 meters wide between our position and the outer trench. Although we were advancing by digging tunnels, we were blocked by enemy fire as soon as we emerged from the tunnel's breakthrough point.

    At this moment, Squad Leader Zhao Shiping gathered all the soldiers in his squad in the trench for an urgent mobilization: "The time has come to liberate the suffering people of Linfen, to avenge ourselves, to complete our meritorious service plan, and to fulfill the glorious task assigned to us by the Party! We must resolutely capture the outer trench!" After Squad Leader Zhao Shiping made a request to the company commander and received permission, he led ten soldiers from his squad to open another tunnel. However, when they reached the breakthrough point, the enemy discovered them again. Zhao Shiping cleverly devised a plan: he opened a box of explosives, and the warriors took advantage of the smoke and flying dirt to rush to the outer trench position.

    Zhao Shiping's squad occupied the forward position of the outer trench, but follow-up troops were unable to advance due to enemy fire. Zhao Shiping ordered the soldiers to quickly dig fortifications, while he monitored the enemy in the front. But before the fortifications were completed, the enemy counterattacked with a squad of soldiers. Zhao Shiping didn't panic, he repelled the enemy with hand grenades. Many of the soldiers in the squad were new recruits, and they asked him: "What are we fighting?" Fearing that they would panic, he said: "It's nothing, dig the fortifications quickly!" When the enemy came up for the second time, Zhao Shiping threw hand grenades with both hands. The soldiers, seeing the enemy's retreat and having dug good shelters, gained more confidence and courage.

    The enemy counterattacked again with a platoon of soldiers. Zhao Shiping calmly told the new soldiers about combat experience and common sense, encouraging them: "Don't panic, the enemy is not scary. If you are not afraid of him, he will be afraid of you!" At the same time, he quickly organized fire, divided the work, and threw hand grenades, separating them into far, near, left, and right, to create a hand grenade net. After repelling four enemy counterattacks in a row, they ran out of hand grenades, and the entrance to the communication trench was blocked by enemy fire. Zhao Shiping wrote a note, wrapped it around a piece of hard earth and threw it to the troops behind. The troops behind tied several boxes of hand grenades and explosives to a long rope and threw one end of the rope to them. They then pulled the hand grenades and explosives to the front.

    The enemy organized a fifth counterattack. Mortar shells, hand grenades, and incendiary bombs rained down on the position, and all the soldiers in the squad were wounded. He himself was also wounded in the hand, but he still encouraged everyone: "Light injuries don't take you off the front line, complete the meritorious service plan!" Zhao Shiping was buried three times by the earth thrown up by artillery shells, but he stood up each time. Unexpectedly, this time, just as he used his arm to push away the earth and pull himself up, a shrapnel hit his head. He passed out for a moment, and when he woke up, he felt a bump on his head the size of an egg. Then, four hand grenades fell next to him at once. He vigilantly kicked two away with his feet, and immediately picked up the other two with his hands and threw them back at the enemy, blowing off the thigh of one of the attacking enemies. The rest were so frightened that they retreated in a disarray.

    The enemy launched an eighth counterattack with a platoon of soldiers. This time, the enemy also sent in planes. Under such intense fire, his closest comrade-in-arms, Deputy Squad Leader Yang Huazhi, sacrificed himself, and three other soldiers shed tears. Zhao Shiping also felt sad. But the enemy, shouting and screaming like a pack of wolves, counterattacked again. Comrade Zhao Shiping gritted his teeth, his eyes reddened: "Comrades, don't be sad, he sacrificed himself for the liberation of our working masses, his sacrifice is glorious! We must avenge the deputy squad leader!" Hatred turned into strength, and the hand grenades they threw exploded on the enemy's bodies...

    There was a break of ten minutes. It was noon, the sun was shining brightly, and the warriors were covered in dust and dirt, their mouths dry and uncomfortable. Just then, several bottles of water were thrown over from our rear position, but almost all of them were broken.

    The soldiers had just taken a few sips of water when the enemy launched another counterattack.

    This was the fourteenth counterattack. The enemy organized a company of soldiers. And on our position, only Zhao Shiping and two soldiers remained. Intense artillery fire swept the position like wind-blown sand. Comrade Zhao Shiping stubbornly raised his head from the artillery fire, his eyes flashing with firm determination. He said forcefully to the two soldiers: "We must hold on until the last minute, as long as we have a breath left, we must defend the position. We can advance an inch, but not retreat an inch!" Soldiers Geng Weiyuan and Li Luolian did not speak, but squeezed out a "yes" from between their teeth, and then pulled the fuses of their hand grenades. However, they were running out of hand grenades. Zhao Shiping then took out his lime grenades (which he had created during training). When Zhao Shiping threw the lime grenades, a cloud of gray-white smoke immediately rose up. The enemy retreated, leaving behind more than thirty corpses in front of the position. The remaining dozen or so enemies with broken arms and legs also fled into the city.

    Comrade Zhao Shiping and the squad he commanded stubbornly held on for eight hours. They defeated a continuous fourteen counterattacks by an entire enemy battalion. Under the intense fire net of enemy planes, artillery, and poison gas, they fought to the last two men without wavering in the slightest. The soil on the position was loosened and turned black, but the position built by the strong will of the people's soldiers was far superior to fortifications made of steel and concrete.

    The battle ended in victory. During the commendation, everyone unanimously agreed that Zhao Shiping played an important role in controlling the outer trench battle, and therefore he was elected as a Special Class People's Hero of the army and awarded a banner with the inscription "Heroic, Tenacious, Persistent in Outer Trench Warfare." Soon after, he honorably joined the Communist Party.

    Next came the Jinzhong Campaign. Zhao Shiping was promoted to deputy platoon leader. During the battle to capture Beiying Village and annihilate the Yan Xishan bandit 45th Division and other units, he was ill, but he still resolutely requested to participate in the assault. After being seriously wounded in the leg, he continued to fight, commanding a squad to capture a mountain gun and eliminate an enemy mortar company.

    Comrade Zhao Shiping is only twenty-five years old this year. He was born in a tenant farmer's family in Yingshang County, Anhui. The landlord's cruel oppression and exploitation planted in him a hatred for class enemies. At the age of nineteen, he was conscripted into the Kuomintang bandit army. He was liberated during the Shangdang Campaign in 1945. While being discharged home, he was again conscripted into the Kuomintang bandit army. Finally, in June 1947, he seized the opportunity to lead seven soldiers back to the ranks of his own people. In the People's Liberation Army, under the cultivation and education of the Communist Party, his class consciousness was raised, making him a people's warrior with a resolute and tenacious fighting will.

　　钢铁战士赵世平
    曾在解放临汾时，坚持外壕战达八小时，击退了敌人十四次的反扑。
    曾出席第一次全国青年代表大会的人民解放军第二野战军某部副连长赵世平同志，是一位钢铁般的青年战斗英雄，在他每次参加的战斗中，都以果敢、机智完成了任务。而在一九四八年五月，解放晋南战略要地临汾时，在夺取外壕、坚守阵地中，更表现了坚决、顽强的斗争意志。
    夺取临汾外壕的战斗，是极其紧张而艰险的。五月十七日晚上，就要总攻城了。为了使部队在城墙爆破后顺利登城，必须首先摧毁敌人的外壕火力阵地，占领外壕。但经过了几天反复的争夺，敌人仍在拚死守着。从我们阵地到外壕又有六十多米宽的开阔地，虽然我们是挖坑道前去，但在坑道的突击口上一露头，就被敌人的火力封锁住了。
    就在这个时候，班长赵世平就在战壕中召集全班战士紧急动员：“为解放临汾受难人民，为我们自己报仇，完成我们的立功计划，完成党给我们的光荣任务的时候到了！我们要坚决夺取外壕！”当赵世平班长向连长提出请求，获得准许后，即带着全班十个战士，另开辟了一条坑道前去。但到突破口上时，敌人又发觉了，赵世平便机智地想了个办法：拉开炸药箱，勇士们就乘着浓烟与飞土，冲到外壕阵地上。
    赵世平班占了外壕前沿阵地，而后续部队又因敌人火力封锁，未能上来。赵世平便让战士们迅速挖工事，他在最前面监视着敌人。但工事还未挖好，敌人就以一个班的兵力反扑上来了。赵世平没有啃气，一个人用手榴弹打退敌人，班里的战士多是新近参军的，问他：“打什么？”他恐怕他们着慌，说：“没有什么，快挖工事！”到敌人第二次上来时，赵世平两手一齐摔出手榴弹去，战士们看着敌人的败退，又有了挖好的掩体，更增加了信心与勇气。
    敌人又以一个排的兵力反扑来了。赵世平一面沉着的告诉新战士们战斗的经验与常识，鼓励他们：“不要慌，敌人是不可怕的，你不怕他，他就怕你！”一面迅速组织火力，分了工，摔手榴弹时，分开远、近、左、右，一齐爆炸，构成手榴弹网。接连打退敌人四次反扑以后，手榴弹没有了，交通坑道口被敌人火力封锁着，赵世平写了一张纸条，包了块硬土摔给后面的部队，后面部队便在一根长绳上拴了几箱手榴弹、炸药，将绳头的一端摔给他们，他们就把手榴弹炸药拉到前边来了。
    敌人又组织第五次反扑了，迫击炮弹、手榴弹、燃烧弹，落满了阵地，全班人都负伤了。他自己手上也负了伤，但他仍鼓励大家：“轻伤不下火线，完成立功计划！”赵世平三次被炮弹炸起的土埋住，都翻起身来，不料这次他刚用胳臂推开土拔出身子，一块炸弹片打到他的头上。他昏迷了一下，醒来一摸，头上起了鸡蛋大的一个疙瘩。接着四颗手榴弹一下落在他身旁，他就机警的用两足踢开两个，马上用两手提起两个回掷敌人，把扑上来的一个敌人的大腿炸断，其余的便吓得连滚带爬地退下去了。
    敌人又以一个排的兵力，进行第八次反扑了。这次，敌人还出动了飞机。在这样密集的火力下，最亲密的战友副班长杨化之同志牺牲了，其他三个战士掉下眼泪，赵世平也心上难过起来。但是敌人又喊着杀声像狼群一样的反扑上来了。赵世平同志咬紧牙，瞪着红了的两眼：“同志们不要难过，他为了我们劳苦大众翻身，他牺牲了是光荣的！我们要为副班长报仇！”仇恨变成力量，他们摔出的手榴弹，颗颗炸在敌人身上……。
    停了十几分钟。这时，正是晌午，太阳当空照着，勇士们浑身都是灰与土，嘴里干燥的难受。正好，从我们后面阵地上又摔过来几瓶水，但几乎全打破了。
    战士们刚喝了几口水，敌人又接连着反扑。
    这是第十四次反扑了，敌人组织了一个连的兵力。而在我们阵地上，就剩下赵世平和两个战士了。密集的炮火像风卷沙土，打满了阵地。赵世平同志顽强地从炮火下抬起头来，眼睛里闪着坚毅的光芒，有力地向两个战士说：“我们要坚持到最后一分钟，只要我们有一口气，我们就要坚守阵地。我们能进一尺，不退一寸！”战士庚卫元、李洛连没有说话，只从牙缝里拚出一个“对”字，接着便拉开手榴弹的火线。但是，手榴弹又不多了，赵世平便拿出他的石灰弹（这是他在练兵时创造的），当赵世平掷出石灰弹时，立即扬起了一片灰白色的烟雾。敌人败退了，在阵地前，遗留下三十多具尸体，剩下的十几个断臂拐腿的敌人也逃进了城里。
    赵世平同志以及他所指挥的班，就这样顽强的一直坚持了八个钟头。打垮了敌人共一个营兵力连续十四次的反扑，在敌人飞机、炮火与毒气弹的密集火网下，战斗到最后两个人时，丝毫没有动摇。阵地上的土都打松，变成黑色了，但是人民战士坚强意志筑起的阵地，却远胜过钢骨水泥的工事。
    战斗胜利结束，评功时，大家一致认为在控制外壕战斗中，赵世平起了重要作用，因而当选为军的特等人民功臣，并赠以“英勇、顽强，坚持外壕战”的锦旗。不久，他光荣地加入了共产党。
    接着是晋中战役。赵世平升任副排长，当攻克北营村歼灭阎匪四十五师等部的战斗中，他正生病，但他仍坚决地要求参加了突击。腿上负重伤后，仍坚持战斗，指挥一个班夺取了一门山炮，并解决了敌人一个迫击炮连。
    赵世平同志今年只有二十五岁。生长在安徽颖上县一个佃农家里。地主对他残酷的压迫、剥削，埋下了他对阶级敌人的仇恨。十九岁时被国民党匪军抓了兵，一九四五年上党战役中被解放。在资遣回家途中，又被国民党匪军抓了兵，终于一九四七年六月乘机带了七个士兵回到人民自己的队伍来。在人民解放军中，在共产党的培养教育下，提高了阶级觉悟，使他成为一个具有坚决顽强斗争意志的人民战士。（附图片）
