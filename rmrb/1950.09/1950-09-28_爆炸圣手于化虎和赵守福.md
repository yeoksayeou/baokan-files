Explosion Masters Yu Huahu and Zhao Shoufu
    He Li
    I. A Pair of Poor Friends

    In Xingcun District, Haiyang County, Jiaodong, there are two outstanding militia heroes whose names, like the landmines they set, have resonated throughout Jiaodong and the Binhai area. They have many heroic stories, which when told, sound almost like myths.

    These two were originally a pair of poor friends. One was called Zhao Shoufu, who lived in Zhao Tuan Village; the other was called Yu Huahu, who lived in Wenshanhou Village. The two villages are backed by Wenshan Mountain and are only about three miles apart. Yu Huahu's original name was Yu Jinsheng, but later, because he was flexible and brave in combat against the enemy, as if a fierce tiger had transformed, the Jiaodong Military Region gave him the name Yu Huahu. Although Yu Huahu's home was in Wenshanhou Village, he had been a hired hand for a landlord in Zhao Tuan Village since he was a child. Zhao Shoufu was also working as a hired laborer in the village, sometimes selling huoshao (sesame flatbread). Because they shared the same poor background, the two had always been very close.

    In 1937, when the Japanese devils invaded China, the Kuomintang bandits in Jiaodong and some local stubborn bandits directly cooperated with the enemy, taking advantage of the chaos to harm the people. They set up poisonous nails in Haiyang City and Xingcun Zhao Tuan. The stubborn bandits in Zhao Tuan Village constantly forced the people to carry water, chop firewood, and build fortifications, and would beat them severely if they didn't like something. Even more innocent farmers had their heads chopped off with铡 knives by the enemy and hung on the branches of trees in front of the village. One day, Zhao Shoufu was chopping firewood for the stubborn bandits, and the pieces of firewood were too rough, so he was beaten by the bandit soldiers until he couldn't stand up straight. That night, Zhao Shoufu went to Yu Huahu's residence, and before he could even speak, hot tears welled up. Yu Huahu had also been sent by the landlord's family to do errands for days on end, suffering all kinds of humiliation, so the two discussed going to take revenge. The next morning, Yu Huahu and Zhao Shoufu each carried a manure basket, shouldering an iron shovel, and deliberately walked past the stubborn bandit sentry post. It turned out that the enemy in this village, in order to prevent the people from resisting, had ordered their sentries not to allow the people to get up early. Sure enough, two sentries interfered, one snatched the manure basket and poured manure all over Zhao Shoufu and Yu Huahu. Yu Huahu, filled with anger, felt it rushing straight from his heels to the top of his head, and raised his iron shovel to chop at one of the sentries. Zhao Shoufu also threw away the manure basket and gave the other sentry a blow with his iron shovel. Both sentries fell to the ground without a sound. Yu and Zhao turned around and slipped back to their residences. This struggle was a victory, and the stubborn bandits didn't know the reason, only guessing: it must be the Eighth Route Army. Soon they withdrew from Zhao Tuan and gathered in Xingcun.

  II. The Birth of the Stone Mine

    At this time, a working comrade named Yu Fengyang came to the village, first found Yu Huahu, and then contacted Zhao Shoufu. Through them, he organized all eighty-odd hired laborers in the village and mobilized the masses to implement rent and interest reduction. From then on, Zhao Tuan and Wenshanhou Village established anti-Japanese democratic regimes. Subsequently, they mobilized the masses in the nearby Xiangjia, Kuangcun, and Sunjiakuang villages to unite against the enemy, beating them until they dared not move easily. The surrounding people called these five villages the Five Tiger Villages. The Japanese devils and stubborn bandits' sweeps became more and more fierce, and Xingcun, where the enemy was stationed, was only twelve miles away from Zhao Tuan. The Five Tiger Villages were all facing the enemy. From 1941, Yu Huahu, Zhao Shoufu, and the people of the five villages lived a life of war every day. Every day they went to the fields with two sets of tools: hoes, sickles, and spears and indigenous cannons. In the beginning, there were few Japanese devils, but many puppet troops and stubborn bandits. These guys couldn't withstand a beating. Even these knife blades and indigenous guns often drove them back. In 1942, the Japanese devils directly occupied Xingcun. The devil soldiers, carrying a fierce aura, rampaged everywhere. At this time, it was not possible to just rely on head-on collisions.

    How could they withstand the fierce attack of the devil soldiers? Yu Huahu suddenly remembered the stonemasons blasting stone mountains near them and felt that stones exploding could also injure or kill the enemy. So he discussed with Zhao Shoufu and the village militia, first using a stone roller from the threshing ground and asking the village stonemason to drill holes in it according to the method of blasting stone mountains, and then installing powder fuses to test it. Sure enough, with a loud thunderous sound, the stones scattered more than ten zhang away, capable of injuring or killing the enemy. When this matter spread, everyone said, "We have plenty of stones in Wenshan Mountain." So each village began to make stone mines.

  III. Stone Mine Establishes its First Miraculous Achievement

    In April 1943, four or five hundred enemies came to attack again. The two men led the militia to bury seventy stone mines at the intersection of the ridge. At that time, there were no detonators, so the militia were pre-ambushed near the stone mines to light the fuses. When the enemy approached, the stones on the entire mountain exploded, and the stone flowers beat the devil soldiers inexplicably, wounding and killing them, forcing them to retreat to the Xingcun stronghold.

    The stone mines drove back the enemy, but because igniting the fuses was inconvenient, the mines exploded before the enemy even reached them, and not many enemies were killed or injured. However, since this incident occurred, it attracted great attention from the county and district leaders, who helped them manufacture a large number of detonators. These detonators, which could be triggered with a touch, increased the confidence of the masses. Soon, the enemy came to attack again, and the five villages laid more than a thousand mines. When the enemy passed through Zhao Tuan and entered the mountainous area of Wenshanhou Village, the villagers' militia launched an attack together, with guns firing from above and mines exploding from below. Five hundred devil soldiers were trapped in the stone minefield, running east and west, unable to escape, suffering thirty or forty casualties, and had to slowly feel their way back to the stronghold.

    From then on, a landmine movement spread throughout Haiyang County. In June, the district issued a large number of iron mines and sent militia members from each village to the district to learn landmine warfare tactics.

  IV. "Come on up! We have no landmines!"

    The enemy came to attack Zhao Tuan and Wenshanhou Village again. This time, the enemy came so secretly and quickly that they passed straight through Zhao Tuan and reached Wenshanhou Village. The villages had no time to prepare. A puppet officer was boasting that they were not afraid of landmines and deliberately proved that there were no landmines here, and that the propaganda about landmines was just a bluff. At this time, Yu Huahu was in Wenshanhou Village. When he heard that the devil soldiers were coming, he had already taken the landmines and buried them separately at key intersections. The enemy continued to advance, and as soon as they reached Yehushan Mountain, two thunderous explosions rang out, causing the enemy soldiers to scatter in panic. The militiamen on the mountain burst into applause, and everyone said in a mocking tone, "Come on up! We have no landmines!" The enemy was furious and immediately reorganized their ranks to attack the militia, but after only a few dozen steps, three more landmines exploded in succession, killing seven and injuring more than forty. The enemy officer who had just boasted had to lead his troops back. Unexpectedly, the rear road was blocked by Zhao Shoufu. When the enemy ran to the south intersection of Zhao Tuan Village, two more landmines exploded, killing and wounding nine people. That day, the enemy soldiers suffered a total of five or sixty casualties and fled back to their stronghold.

    From then on, the enemy also learned to be smarter. Every time they attacked, they sent out mine-sweeping teams in front. Whenever they found a suspicious place with fresh soil, they would draw a circle next to it to mark it. Zhao Shoufu and Yu Huahu saw through the enemy's trick and began to dig up fresh soil everywhere, creating suspicious traces, but conversely, they buried landmines in many places without fresh soil. The mines continued to bloom everywhere. When the enemy no longer believed in fresh soil, they inserted straw men and wooden signs with slogans written on them next to the fresh soil. The enemy saw it and got angry, avoiding the fresh soil, rushing up to pull them out, and exploding one every time they pulled one out. The enemy had no way to deal with it and could only stare at them from afar in frustration.

  V. What an interesting spectacle!

    The enemy's new method came again. Whenever they discovered a mine, they would dig it up and send people to take it back to show their devil officer as a rare spectacle. What to do about this? After careful research by Yu Huahu, Zhao Shoufu, and others, they installed another type of internal ignition device. One day, the enemy dug up several of their stone mines and just flipped them over to carry them on their bodies. The stone mines immediately exploded. One mine, because it ignited very slowly, was carried all the way back by the enemy soldier and presented on the devil officer's desk. This thing was indeed rare! A group of devil officers were feeling happy when suddenly a thunderous explosion rang out, and the devils in the office were blown to pieces. But the enemy still wanted to dig up the mines, so Zhao Shoufu, Yu Huahu, and their explosion experts invented mother-and-child mines, causing the enemy to dare not come and take the mines again.

    The enemy's tricks came again. They dared not touch the ground with their hands, and even a blade of grass seemed to be their enemy. So they used magnifying glasses to examine the ground. When they found a mine, they would use a long pole to hook it. Our mines were being destroyed by the enemy. Whenever the enemy's mine-sweeping team was sweeping mines in front, a large group of devil soldiers would always hide nearby in concealed places. When the mine exploded, they would clap their hands and laugh behind them. What a truly interesting spectacle! They were beside themselves with joy. After several times of hooking the mines, Yu Huahu and Zhao Shoufu found out the enemy's pattern. In April 1944, more than five hundred enemies came to attack. Yu Huahu, Zhao Shoufu, and their explosion team buried fake mines on the main road near Penggezhuang, to the left front of Zhao Tuan Village, and then buried eighteen real mines in nearby concealed places. Sure enough, the enemy's mine-sweeping team checked the main road and found the mines, and signaled to the back. A large group of enemies immediately entered the concealed places and threw themselves to the side of the embankment. With a roar, a flash of smoke filled the air, and twelve landmines exploded in succession, blowing more than twenty enemies to bits.

  VI. There's nothing we can do! We still can't do anything.

    The enemy's cunning trick of hooking mines failed again, and the enemy was helpless. They no longer wanted to compete with Yu Huahu and Zhao Shoufu in a mine-laying contest. They attempted to avoid the landmines, not taking the main roads, but specializing in mountain ridges, riverbanks, forests, and places where people rarely went. But no matter how fierce the enemy was, Yu Huahu and Zhao Shoufu's landmines were always entangled with them at any time and in any place.

    Yu Huahu and Zhao Shoufu had close ties with the masses, and their intelligence was very well informed. They had already learned this news, and also learned that the enemy had gathered more than a thousand people to retaliate, and vowed to implement the three-all policy, wiping out these Five Tiger Villages. But this did not deter the heroic struggle of the people. After Yu Huahu and Zhao Shoufu received the intelligence, everyone held an emergency meeting to study and estimate the several roads that the enemy might take to attack, and then set out to meet the enemy separately. Yu Huahu set up a minefield in Penzishan Mountain, and Zhao Shoufu set up a mine network in Dugezhuang. The next day, the enemy began to attack. The enemy advanced towards Penzishan Mountain. It turned out that Penzishan Mountain had two peaks, the big peak in front and the small peak in the back, and the connection between the two peaks was a narrow ridge. There was a fort on the big peak, and the fort had only two stone gates in the front and back. From the big peak to the small peak, there was only a dangerous path that people rarely traveled. Yu Huahu placed landmines at the key intersections of this mountain. The enemy in front of Penzishan Mountain began to appear. Yu Huahu fired a shot into the sky to lure the enemy up the mountain. Sure enough, the enemy rushed towards Penzishan Mountain, disregarding their lives, attacked the big peak, entered the fort, and went straight to the second peak. As soon as they exited the back gate of the fort, two landmines exploded with a bang. The devils continued to advance, descending the mountain ridge, and two more landmines exploded on the slope. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy quickly shrank back, darting into the side of the road. Then, several more loud roars rang out, blowing the devils' legs off and breaking their backs. The enemy's corpses and wounded soldiers rolled down the cliffs on both sides of the mountain, and a wail echoed through the valley. The enemy dared not move forward again, and had to retreat step by step, searching for the footprints they had stepped on. The twelve-mile journey took eight or nine hours. They retreated from mid-morning until it was dark before returning to Xingcun. That day, a total of more than forty enemies were killed and wounded.

  VII. If you don't come, I'll deliver it to your door!

    After the explosions that day, Yu Huahu, Zhao Shoufu, and others were preparing for the enemy to retaliate, but unexpectedly, after waiting for more than ten days, the enemy did not come to attack. "If you don't come, I'll deliver it to your door." Once, Zhao Shoufu, covered in mud, and Yu Huahu climbed into the enemy's stronghold in the dark of night, and unknowingly buried a landmine under the enemy's desk, blowing five puppet soldiers into the air the next day. Another time, Yu Huahu took advantage of the enemy's sweep to return to Xingcun and secretly placed four landmines at the entrance of the enemy's dormitory corridor. When a group of enemy soldiers returned to the dormitory after dinner, four mines exploded together, and it took two trucks to transport the dead and wounded enemies back to Qingdao. Then, the anti-Japanese democratic regime also pushed forward to the enemy's front. Each village organized militia to surround Xingcun, and the surrounding area was covered with iron and stone mines, which exploded and prevented the enemy from leaving Xingcun for more than two or three li. In August 1944, the enemy finally abandoned Xingcun and fled to Haiyang City.

  VIII. Landmines Spread Throughout the Jiaodong and Binhai Areas

    From then on, both of them were transferred out of this area to carry out the landmine movement in various places. They took their expeditionary explosion team to help various places organize landmine battles, and also accepted invitations from various places to train a large number of mine layers. They used the method of apprentices teaching apprentices to popularize landmine warfare to the vast areas of Jiaodong and Binhai. Zhao Shoufu played a particularly large role in training mine layers. In 1945, Zhao Shoufu established a twelve-member explosion team and was transferred to Laiyang to fight. These twelve people were all explosion experts from Haiyang County. They first trained 300 militiamen in the Laiyang Armed Training Class. Later, they cooperated with a certain battalion of the military region to besiege Laiyang City, laying more than 400 mines three times to blockade the enemy, killing and wounding more than 400 enemies. Seeing that the role of the mines was very large, the entire battalion came to learn. The twelve of them taught separately, teaching the entire battalion. Later, in the Binbei Sub-district of the Binhai District, they taught all three regiments of the sub-district troops and about 10,000 militiamen sent by the seven counties for training. He directly and indirectly trained a total of 12,000 mine layers. Among them, eighty-two became explosion heroes or models. Yu Huahu also cultivated 120 model militiamen and 1,400 explosion experts in Haiyang, Penglai, Huangxian, and Jimo in Jiaodong.

    From the Anti-Japanese War to the Liberation War, the two men fought for more than ten years and made great contributions to the people. The two men created about 30 types of mines and fought in more than 200 large and small battles. According to Yu Huahu's statistics, he alone killed or wounded more than 170 enemies. He was once awarded the title of Explosion King and three times awarded the title of Explosion Hero. Zhao Shoufu independently killed or wounded a total of 138 enemies, destroyed two enemy vehicles, and was selected three times as a Jiaodong District Militia Combat Hero (twice ranking first).

　　爆炸圣手于化虎和赵守福
    贺笠
    一、一对穷朋友
    胶东海阳县邢村区有两位杰出的民兵英雄，这两个人的名字正像他们所放的地雷一样，响遍了整个胶东和滨海地区。他们有很多英勇的故事，传说起来好像神话一样。
    这两人原是一对穷朋友，一个叫赵守福，家住赵疃村；一个叫于化虎，住在文山后村。两村都背靠文山，相距不过三里。这于化虎原名叫于晋生，后来因为对敌人作战灵活勇猛，好像猛虎化身，胶东军区就授给他一个名字叫于化虎。于化虎虽然家在文山后村，但自小就在赵疃村给地主扛长活。赵守福也是在村里当雇工，有时卖过火烧（即烧饼）。由于穷根相连，两人从来就耍得很亲热。
    一九三七年日本鬼子侵略中国，胶东国民党匪帮和一些地方上的顽匪更直接与敌人互相配合，趁火打劫，残害百姓。在海阳城、邢村赵疃，他们都打下了恶毒的钉子。赵疃村的顽匪一天不停点的抓老百姓担水、劈柴、做工事，稍不顺眼就是一顿饱打。更有许多无辜农民的头颅被敌人用铡刀铡断，吊在村前的树枝上。一天，赵守福给顽匪劈柴，柴块子劈的粗了，被匪兵打得直不起腰来。夜里赵守福便到于化虎的住处，话未开口就滚出一股热泪。于化虎也是连日被地主家派去应差，受尽凌辱，于是两人商量要去报复。第二天早上，于化虎、赵守福各提着一个粪筐，扛着一把铁锨，故意打顽匪岗哨跟前走过。原来这村的敌人为防备人民的反抗，曾下令他们的岗哨不准人民早起，果然两个哨兵干涉了，一个夺下粪筐就泼了赵守福、于化虎满身的粪，于化虎一股怒气早已由脚跟直冲顶门，举起铁锨就向着一个哨兵劈头砍去，赵守福、也撇开粪筐给另一个哨兵一铁锨。两个哨兵都一声不响地倒在地上了。于、赵两人也回身溜到自己的住处。这一场斗争胜利了，顽匪不知情由，只臆测：这一定是八路军。不久他们就退出赵疃，麇集到邢村去。
  二、石雷的诞生
    这时村里来了个工作同志名叫于凤阳，首先找到了于化虎，又联系上赵守福，并通过他们把全村八十几个雇工都组织起来，并发动群众实行减租减息。从此赵疃、文山后村都建立起抗日民主政权。随后又发动起附近的向家、框村、孙家框三村群众联合抗敌，打得敌人不敢轻易活动，周围的人民都称这五村为五虎村。鬼子顽匪的扫荡越来越厉害，敌人所驻的邢村，离赵疃只十二里。五虎村都面临着敌人。从一九四一年起，于化虎、赵守福和五村的人民天天过着战争的生活。每天上地都带着两套家具，锄头镰刀和刀矛土炮。开始时日本鬼子来的少，伪军顽匪来的多。这些家伙吃不住打。就这些刀片，土枪也常常把他们打退。一九四二年，日本鬼子直接占领了邢村。鬼子兵挟着凶横的气焰，狼奔豕突地到处冲击，这时光凭硬碰是不行的了。
    怎样才能顶住鬼子兵的猛攻呢？于化虎突然想起石匠在他们近旁爆炸石山的事，感到石头开花也可以杀伤敌人。于是他就与赵守福和村里的民兵商量，先用了个碾场的石滚，请村里的石匠按照炸石山的方法打上眼，装上药线试验。果然，一声巨雷，石子飞散了十来丈远，可以杀伤敌人。这个事情一传出去，大家都说：“我们文山有的是石头。”于是各村都打起石雷来了。
  三、石雷首建奇功
    一九四三年四月，四、五百敌人又来进攻了，两人便领导民兵在岭下路口埋了七十来颗石雷。当时没有雷管，由民兵预先埋伏在石雷的跟前点药线。敌人接近时，满山的石头都爆炸了，一朵朵的石花打得鬼子兵莫名其妙，伤的伤亡的亡，退回邢村据点去。
    石雷把敌人炸退了，但是由于点火不方便，敌人还不到石雷跟前就爆炸了，杀伤的敌人不多。不过自这件事情发生以后，引起县区的领导同志很大的注意，帮助他们制造了大批雷管。这雷管一触即发，提高了群众的信心。不久，敌人又来进攻，五村下了一千多颗雷。当敌人穿过赵疃进到文山后村的山岭地带时，各村民兵一齐发起战斗，上有枪打，下有雷炸，五百个鬼子兵陷在石雷阵里，东奔西突，脱身不得，伤亡三、四十人，只得慢慢摸回据点。
    从此全海阳县都展开了地雷运动。六月里，区上发下大批铁雷，并抽各村民兵到区学习使地雷战术。
  四、“上来吧！我们是没有地雷的！”
    敌人又来进攻赵疃、文山后村了。这次敌人来得如此机密迅速，一直穿过赵疃，直抵文山后村。各村都来不及准备。一个伪军官正在夸口他们不怕地雷，而且就此故意证明说：这里不是没有地雷吗？宣传有地雷都不过是虚张声势。这时于化虎正在文山后村，听说鬼子兵来了，早已抱上地雷在要路口分头埋下。敌人继续向前进攻，刚到夜壶山，轰轰两声雷响了，炸得敌兵乱窜。山上的民兵响起一片掌声，大家都带着奚落的口吻：“上来吧！我们是没有地雷的！”敌人气急了，立刻整顿队伍向民兵进攻，走不过几十步，接连又响了三颗地雷，炸死七名，伤四十余名。刚才夸口的敌军官，只得领上队伍回头就窜。不料后路又被赵守福截住，敌人跑到赵疃村南路口，又是两个地雷爆炸了，死伤了九人，这天敌兵一共伤亡五、六十人逃回据点去。
    从此以后敌人也学的乖了，每次进攻，都在前面派出检雷组，凡是发现有新土可疑的地方就在旁边画圈作记号。赵守福、于化虎看出敌人的门道，便虚虚实实地到处扒出新土，露出可疑的痕迹，相反的在许多无新土的地方倒是埋下地雷了。雷仍然在四处开花。等到敌人不相信新土了，他们又在有新土的旁边插草人，插木牌，上面写上标语。敌人看见生气了，避开新土，抢上来就拔，拔一个炸一个，敌人没办法，只是远远的瞪着眼干着急。
  五、好看的稀奇事！
    敌人的新办法又来了。他们一发现有雷的地方就把雷起出来，并派人抱回去送给他们的鬼官看稀奇。这事情怎么办呢？经过于化虎、赵守福等细心研究便装置了另一种内部点火的办法。这一天，敌人起出他们好几颗石雷，刚将雷翻过身来抱在身上。石雷马上爆炸了。有一颗雷，因点火最慢，敌兵一直抱回献在鬼子官的办公桌上。这玩意也真稀罕呵！一群鬼子军官正感到高兴，突然一声雷响，办公室里的鬼子被炸得粉身碎骨。但是敌人仍然要来起雷，赵守福、于化虎和他们的爆炸手又发明了子母雷，炸得敌人不敢再来取雷了。
    敌人的花样又来了，他们不敢用手到地里去触动，连一根草也似乎在与他们为敌，于是他们就用扩大镜在地里照，发现有雷的地方就用一根长竿子去钩。我们的雷被敌人破坏了。每当敌人的扫雷组在前面扫雷的时候，大队的鬼子兵总是隐藏在附近隐蔽的地方。地雷爆炸了，他们就在后面拍手欢笑。这玩意儿真好看呵！他们得意忘形了。经过几次钩雷以后，于化虎、赵守福又找出敌人的规律。一九四四年四月，五百多敌人来进攻。于化虎、赵守福和他们的爆炸组，便在赵疃村左前方棚格庄附近的大路上埋下假雷，然后在近旁的隐蔽地埋下十八颗真雷。果然，敌人的扫雷组在大路上检查出雷来了，向后面打了个招呼，大群的敌人都立即进入隐蔽地往地棱边一扑，轰隆隆霎时间一片烟火腾空，接连响了十二颗地雷，二十多个敌人炸得血肉横飞。
  六、无可奈何呵！还是奈何不得。
    敌人钩雷的诡技又失败了，敌人无可奈何了。他们再不想与于化虎、赵守福作斗雷的竞赛，他们企图避免地雷，不走正道，专走山岭、河边、树林和人迹不到之地。但是不管敌人如何的凶狠，于化虎、赵守福的地雷总是随时随地纠缠在他们的身旁。
    于化虎、赵守福与群众有密切的联系，他们的情报是非常灵通的。他们早已知道了这一消息，并探知敌人集中了一千多人要来报复，并扬言实行三光政策，荡平这五虎村，但是，这并吓不退人民的英雄斗争的。于化虎、赵守福得到情报以后，大家召开紧急会议研究，估计敌人攻击可能走的几条道路，然后分头迎敌。于化虎在盆子山摆设雷阵，赵守福在杜圪庄布置雷网。第二天敌人开始来进攻了。敌人向盆子山的方向前进。原来盆子山有两个山峰，前面是大顶，后面是小顶，两峰连接处是一道窄狭的山脊。大顶上面有一个围子，围子只有前后两道石门，从大顶到小顶，只有一条人迹罕通的险道。于化虎便在这山的要路口安下地雷。盆子山前的敌人开始出现了。于化虎朝空就是一枪，引诱敌人上山。果然敌人不顾狗命的向盆子山上冲来，攻上大顶，进入围子，直向二顶前进。刚出围子后门，冷不防轰轰两颗地雷响了。鬼子继续前进，下山脊，在斜坡处又响了两颗。敌人见势头不对急往后缩，闪入道旁，又是几声巨吼，炸得鬼子腿断腰折，敌人的尸体和伤兵纷纷滚下两面山崖，一片哀号响彻山谷。敌人再也不敢前进，只得一步一步地寻找自己踏过的足迹退走。十二里的路程就走了八九个钟头，从半上午撤退，直到天黑才回到邢村。这天共炸死炸伤敌人四十余人。
  七、你不来，我送上门去！
    这一天的爆炸之后，于化虎、赵守福等正准备敌人来报复，不料一等十多天，敌人不来进攻了。“你们不来，我就送上门去。”有一次赵守福混身抹着泥与于化虎乘黑夜爬进敌人据点，神不知鬼不觉地在敌人办公桌下埋下地雷，第二天把五个伪军炸飞了。又一次于化虎乘敌人扫荡回去混入邢村，偷偷地在敌人宿舍通道门口下了四颗地雷。当一群敌兵饭后回宿舍，四颗雷一齐炸响，死伤的敌人用了两辆汽车才运回青岛。接着抗日民主政权也推向敌人跟前，各村都组织起民兵把邢村包围起来，周围布满了铁雷石雷，炸得敌人出不了邢村二、三里。一九四四年八月，敌人终于放弃了邢村逃到海阳城去了。
  八、地雷普及胶东滨海区
    从此以后，两人都被调出本区，到各地开展地雷运动，他们一面带着自己的远征爆炸队帮助各地组织地雷战斗，一面接受各地邀请大量训练雷手，并用徒弟教徒弟的办法，使地雷战普及到胶东滨海广大地区。在训练雷手方面，赵守福的作用特别大，一九四五年赵守福成立了一个十二人的爆炸队，被调到莱阳作战。这十二个人都是海阳县爆炸能手，他们首先在莱阳武装训练班训练了民兵三百人。以后又配合军区部队某营围困莱阳城，三次下雷四百余颗封锁敌人，炸死炸伤敌人四百余名。该营看见雷的作用很大，全营都来学。他们十二个人分头教练，把全营都教会。以后又在滨海区的滨北分区把分区部队的三个团和七个县调来受训的民兵约一万人全部都教会了。前后经他直接间接训练的雷手共达一万二千人。其中有八十二名并成了爆炸英雄或模范。于化虎亦在胶东的海阳、蓬莱、黄县、即墨等地培养了模范民兵一百二十、爆炸手一千四百名。
    两人从抗日战争到解放战争，前后十年多的战斗，为人民立了很大的功劳。两人共创造雷约三十种，大小战斗各二百余次。据于化虎的统计，他一人毙伤敌人一百七十来人。一次被奖为爆炸大王，三次被奖为爆炸英雄。赵守福单独作战可以统计的共毙伤敌人一百三十八名，毁敌汽车二辆，三次被选为胶东区民兵战斗英雄（两次名列第一）。（附图片）
