　　British Trades Union Congress 82nd Annual Meeting Opens
    Traitor Brock Calls for Support of US Imperialist Aggression Against Korea; Audience Strongly Opposes Rhodes' Anti-Soviet Speech
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th] (TASS dispatch) The 82nd Annual Meeting of the British Trades Union Congress opened on September 4th in Brighton, Sussex. 917 delegates attended the conference, representing 186 union organizations with a total membership of 7,883,355, which is 53,245 less than at last year's annual meeting.

    The reactionary right-wing leadership of the Trades Union Congress aims at this year's annual meeting to have the membership support the Labor government's war plans in order to support the imperialist policies of the United States. They want the conference to vote in favor of a massive increase in military spending, without any regard for the fact that this move would inevitably further increase the already heavy burden borne by the British working class. They declared that any delegates who intend to call for friendship with the Soviet Union and oppose the warmongers of the United States and Britain during the conference must be severely punished.

    The opening session on September 4th was chaired by Brock of the National Union of General and Municipal Workers. He tried his best to prove that workers must endure the deterioration of living conditions caused by the "threat" from the Soviet Union, but the delegates remained solemnly silent when he spoke about this. Brock called for full support for the United States' policy towards Korea. At the same time, he attacked the World Federation of Trade Unions and tried his best to promote the so-called International Confederation of Free Trade Unions of traitors.

    During the meeting on the 5th, London Trades Council treasurer, Leverett, protested against the threat in the General Council's report that the London Trades Council would be expelled from the British Trades Union Congress if it did not "actively demonstrate its willingness and ability to uphold the policies of the Congress." Although his speech won the support of many delegates, the General Council's report was still passed.

    The representative of the American Federation of Labor, Rhodes, chairman of the Hat Workers' Union, viciously attacked the Soviet Union and the world peace movement at the meeting on the 5th. But the audience treated Rhodes' speech with strong disgust, the whole place was full of discussion, people were shouting, and the order was greatly disturbed.

    According to a Telecommunications Agency report, when Rhodes attacked trade with the Soviet Union, saying, "We don't need Soviet furs and crab meat," the audience shouted, "We don't need American atomic bombs!" When he mentioned the war of 1939, the whole venue burst into laughter, with some shouting "Where were the Americans then?" When he boasted that the Americans were "the first to fight" in Korea, some delegates shouted: "Let them continue to do it themselves!" Chairman Brock sternly demanded that "order" be maintained in the venue, but the answer he received was people's shouts: "Better tell him to shut up!"

    The Telecommunications Agency pointed out: "The delegates' hostile attitude towards Rhodes shows that, no matter what the reactionary policies of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress may lead to, most delegates actually know the threat of American imperialism."

　　英职工大会八十二届年会开幕
    工贼布洛克要求支持美帝侵朝  会众强烈反对罗兹的反苏演说
    【新华社六日讯】综合塔斯社讯：英国职工大会第八十二届年会已于九月四日在苏塞克斯郡布来屯开幕。出席大会的有代表九百十七名，代表所属工会组织一八六个单位，会员总人数为七百八十八万三千三百五十五名，比去年开年会时少了五万三千二百四十五名。
    职工大会的反动右翼领导机关在本届年会上的目的，是要使会员群众为工党政府的战争计划作后盾，以支持美国的帝国主义政策。他们要大会投票赞成大量增加军费，而丝毫不顾此举势必使英国工人阶级已经负荷的沉重负担愈益加重。他们宣称，凡在大会期间意图呼吁与苏联友好，而反对美英战争贩子的那些代表们，一定要受到严厉制裁。
    九月四日的开幕会议由全国普通与市政工人联合会的布洛克主持。他竭力企图证明工人必须忍受由于苏联的“威胁”而造成的生活条件的恶化，但是，在他讲到这一段时，代表们始终表示严肃的沉默。布洛克要求全力支持美国对朝鲜的政策。同时他攻击世界工会联合会，而竭力替工贼的所谓国际自由工会联合会捧场。
    在五日会议中，伦敦工会委员会司库勒维特在发言时。抗议最高委员会报告书中所称伦敦工会委员会若不“积极表明它愿意而且有能力拥护大会的政策”，就要被逐出英国职工大会的威胁。他的发言虽然博得许多代表的支持，但是最高委员会的报告书还是被通过了。
    美国劳工联合会的代表、帽业工会主席罗兹，在五日会上恶毒地攻击苏联及世界和平运动。但是会众以强烈的厌恶来对待罗兹的演说，全场议论纷纷，人声鼎沸，秩序大乱。
    据电通社报道，当罗兹攻击同苏联贸易说：“我们不需要苏联的皮货与蟹肉”时，会众高呼：“我们不需要美国的原子弹！”当他提到一九三九年的战争时，整个会场哄堂大笑，其中有人高叫“那时候美国人在那里呢？”当他夸耀美国人在朝鲜“首先作战”时，若干代表高呼：“让他们继续自己去干吧！”主席布洛克严厉要求维持会场的“秩序”，但他得到的回答是人们的吼叫：“最好叫他闭嘴！”
    电通社指出：“代表们对罗兹的敌意态度说明，不管职工大会最高委员会的反动政策会造成什么结果，大多数代表实际上是知道美国帝国主义的威胁的。”
