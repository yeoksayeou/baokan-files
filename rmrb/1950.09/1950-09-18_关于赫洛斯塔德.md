　　About Herostratus
(Question) In Simonov's "Bloody Deceivers" published in the "Defend World Peace Special Issue" on August 14, the second paragraph mentions Herostratus, an ancient born arsonist. I would like to know what era and place Herostratus was from. Please inform me.
Reader Fan Zhengming
(Answer) Herostratus was a resident of Ephesus in ancient Greece in the fourth century BC. The ruins of this ancient city are located in present-day Ayasoluk in Asia Minor. According to ancient Roman history, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus was once very famous and was a holy place of pilgrimage for people from far and wide. The building of the temple was 425 feet long, 200 feet wide, and the roof was 60 feet high, supported by 120 columns, of which 36 were exquisitely carved. In 376 BC, on the same night that Alexander the Great was born, Herostratus, a native of Ephesus, suddenly became ruthless and set fire to this magnificent temple. He had only one motive for his ruthlessness, which was to use this world-shaking act of destruction to make his name go down in history.

　　关于赫洛斯塔德
    （问）八月十四日出版的《保卫世界和平专刊》所载西蒙诺夫的《血腥的骗子们》文中第二段提到古代天生的玩火者赫洛斯塔德。不知赫洛斯塔德是什么时代什么地方的人，请见告。
                 读者范正明
    （答）赫洛斯塔德（Herostratus）是公元前四世纪古希腊的埃非塞斯城人。这古城的遗址就在现今小亚细亚的阿耶索路克地方。据古罗马的历史上所载，埃非塞斯城的阿几米斯女神庙从前非常有名，是远近的人们朝拜的圣地。庙的建筑长四百二十五英尺，阔二百英尺，屋顶高六十英尺，撑着圆柱一百二十根，其中三十六根雕刻得极其精美。就在公元前三七六年，亚历山大大帝诞生的同一晚上埃非塞斯本城人赫洛斯塔德忽然发了狠心，放一把火把这座富丽堂皇的神庙烧毁了。他发狠心只有一个动机，就是想借这一震动世界的破坏事件，使自己的名字在历史上留传下去。
