Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th. The People's Government in the disaster area of northern Anhui has led the disaster-stricken people in rushing to plant late autumn crops, reaching over 14 million mu, exceeding the planned target of 13 million mu set by the Northern Anhui People's Administrative Office. In the severely affected special districts of Fuyang and Suxian, over 12 million mu of late autumn crops have been planted, reaching over 95% of the arable land area suitable for replanting in these two special districts.

Since the floodwaters began to recede in the disaster area of northern Anhui in late July, governments at all levels in the region have convened meetings of cadres and disaster-stricken people to mobilize the people to rush-plant late autumn crops. Through detailed accounting and democratic discussions, they strengthened the confidence of working cadres and the masses at all levels of the People's Government in self-reliance through production. At the same time, they specifically solved the difficulty of a shortage of seeds, enabling the disaster-stricken people in the region to carry out replanting smoothly.

However, from mid-August, the late autumn crops that had emerged in various places were widely affected by insect pests; some areas also experienced drought, which affected the disaster-stricken people's continued replanting efforts. In addition, a blindly optimistic mood once prevailed among cadres in the disaster area, who believed that "replanting is almost complete," fostering a "let's take a rest" mentality. Based on these circumstances, the People's Governments in various disaster areas promptly conducted seedling inspection and planting inspection work, and educated cadres to overcome complacency, enabling cadres to promptly lead the disaster-stricken people in carrying out pest control and water diversion to combat drought and protect seedlings. As a result, the late autumn crops that had been planted in various places did not suffer serious disasters; and areas affected by drought that had not been planted adopted the method of diverting water to irrigate fields, continuing to carry out replanting work.

At present, the work of rushing to plant late autumn crops in the disaster area of northern Anhui has basically ended. The early-planted late autumn crops are growing vigorously after pest control and irrigation. Buckwheat in the Suxian special district has grown to more than half a foot high and has begun to blossom. Currently, disaster-stricken people in various places are carrying out weeding of late autumn crops and continuing to block breaches and completely eliminate insect pests to ensure the harvest of late autumn crops.

　　皖北超计划完成补种工作  已种晚秋一千四百余万亩
    经捕虫和引水抗旱后秋苗生长旺盛
    【新华社上海十三日电】皖北灾区人民政府领导灾民抢种晚秋作物已达一千四百余万亩，超额完成了皖北人民行政公署预定抢种一千三百万亩的计划。重灾区阜阳、宿县两专区共抢种晚秋一千二百多万亩，已达到该两专区中可能补种的耕地面积百分之九十五以上。
    自七月下旬皖北灾区洪水开始退落以来，该区各级人民政府为发动灾民抢种晚秋作物，先后召开干部会议与灾民会议，通过算细账与民主讨论的方法，加强了各级人民政府工作干部与群众的生产自救的信心。同时并具体解决了缺少种子的困难，使该区灾民得以顺利进行抢种。
    但自八月中旬起，各地已出土的晚秋作物又普遍发生虫害；部分地区又呈干旱现象，使灾民继续抢种，受到了影响。另外，在灾区干部中，曾一度发生盲目乐观情绪，认为：“补种已差不多了”，滋长着“歇歇”的思想。各灾区的人民政府根据这些情况，及时进行查苗、查种工作，并教育干部克服了麻痹思想，使干部及时领导灾民进行了捕捉害虫和引水抗旱的保苗斗争，因而使各地已种的晚秋未遭受严重灾害；而受旱未种的地区则采用引水灌田的方法，继续进行抢种工作。
    目前皖北灾区抢种晚秋作物工作已基本结束，早种的晚秋作物经捕虫、浇水后，生长旺盛。宿县专区的荞麦已长至半尺多高，并开始放花。现各地灾民正进行晚秋作物的锄草工作，并继续进行堵口和彻底消灭虫害，以确保晚秋的收获。
