Nanchang City Telecommunications Bureau Employees Resolve to Eliminate Errors and Conserve Materials

[This Dispatch from Nanchang] The entire staff of the Nanchang City Telecommunications Bureau wrote a letter to Chairman Mao on the eve of National Day to express their respect and report that, in the production competition, they are determined to greet the first National Day of New China with practical actions of eliminating errors and conserving materials. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:

New China has been born for a year. Under your leadership and that of the Central People's Government, brilliant achievements have been made in politics, military affairs, and diplomacy over the past year. All the employees of the Nanchang City Telecommunications Bureau extend our highest respect to you.

In order to welcome the arrival of the first National Day, all departments of the bureau have launched a major production competition. The carrier room guarantees to repair a carrier machine from inventory, and the telegraph and telephone rooms guarantee to eliminate telegraph and telephone errors. Long-distance line workers guarantee to thoroughly patrol and repair 280 *hua li* of lines before National Day. The transmitting station guarantees to repair 17 incomplete small-scale transceiver sets. There are many other departments that have made commitments, which will not be reported here one by one. In short, we are determined to use practical actions to eliminate telegraph and telephone errors, conserve materials, and reduce costs by utilizing waste materials to improve the telecommunications business, cooperate with land reform work, strive for the early liberation of Taiwan, thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the Chiang bandits, and strike at the aggression of American imperialism! We extend our highest respects!

Respectfully submitted by all employees of the Nanchang City Telecommunications Bureau
