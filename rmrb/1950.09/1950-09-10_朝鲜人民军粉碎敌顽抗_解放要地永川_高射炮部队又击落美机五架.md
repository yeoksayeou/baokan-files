Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 9th: The General Headquarters of the Korean People's Army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announced in a war bulletin on the evening of the 8th that the People's Army units fiercely attacking Yongcheon had crushed the enemy's resistance in that area and dealt them a heavy blow.

On September 7, the People's Army units completely liberated Yongcheon, an important stronghold on the enemy's northern defense line, a strategic point, and the base of the puppet 8th Division.

In the battle to liberate Yongcheon, the People's Army units inflicted a devastating blow on the main force of the Lee Seung-man puppet army's 8th Division, posing a significant flank threat to the enemy's defense system around Daegu.

The People's Army units that liberated Yongcheon are pursuing the enemy and advancing rapidly.

The People's Army units fighting on the southern coast fiercely attacked the American troops carrying out desperate counter-attacks under the cover of tanks, defeated the enemy's attempts to counter-attack, and inflicted huge losses. In the fighting in that area, the People's Army units killed or wounded more than 700 American soldiers and captured four tanks, 42 vehicles, and a large number of other weapons and ammunition.

The People's Army units advancing southward after liberating Gunwi fiercely attacked the enemy resisting stubbornly south of Gunwi, killing or wounding more than 800 enemies and capturing more than 30 mortars, more than 40,000 rounds of various shells, and a large number of weapons and ammunition.

On September 4, the People's Army anti-aircraft artillery units shot down three American fighter planes that invaded the Sinanju area. On September 5, two American fighter planes that invaded Pyongyang were shot down.

The People's Army units gave the counter-attacking enemy a powerful blow, causing the enemy to fall into a state of complete collapse, and the headquarters, division commander, and staff members of the Lee Seung-man puppet army's so-called "Capital Division" fled in panic.

The People's Army units that liberated Waegwan fiercely attacked the enemy who continued to resist stubbornly south of Waegwan, relying on solid positions, destroying 22 enemy weapons bunkers, killing or wounding more than 400 enemies, and capturing four tanks, eight vehicles, eleven heavy machine guns, twenty-three light machine guns, more than 50,000 rounds of various shells, more than 150 landmines, and a large number of other spoils of war. The People's Army units in that area have penetrated deep into the enemy's formation and are continuing to advance rapidly.

On September 3, the People's Army units in that area shot down two American planes.

The people's guerrillas near Masan and Jeju Island, in coordination with the People's Army units' offensive, launched vigorous activities.

On September 4, the people's guerrillas near Masan launched a surprise attack on an American communications company, killing or wounding more than 50 American soldiers, capturing 14 American infantrymen, two translators, nine marines, and capturing more than 30 rifles, four telephones, and more than 100 hand grenades.

The people's guerrillas active in the northern and southern parts of Jeju Island attacked the puppet police stations, killing several traitorous bandits, and cutting off telegraph and telephone lines.
