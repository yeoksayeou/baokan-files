　　To welcome the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers and the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, production emulation campaigns are being launched successively in factories, mines, and railway systems. Following the launch of a production competition by factories such as cement, glass, paint, electrical machinery, and light bulbs under the Far East Electric Power Company in the Lüda District to complete the year's production tasks ahead of schedule to welcome the first anniversary of the People's Republic of China (for details, see page 2 of this newspaper on August 16), all railway workers in Northeast China launched a production competition to complete and exceed the transportation and construction tasks for September, ensure quality, reduce costs, and create new production achievements as a gift for National Day. The workers guarantee to exceed the September loading plan by 10%, reduce the vehicle turnaround rate by 2.5 hours according to the standard of 1.86 days, and ensure that the utilization rate of vehicles in operation reaches 70% (it was 65% in July). Ensure punctuality and full axle loads, requiring 100% punctuality for passenger trains and striving for 100% punctuality for freight trains. In terms of locomotives, it is necessary to increase axle load traction, increase daily vehicle kilometers by 4%, increase technical speed by 0.5 kilometers, promote the 500-kilometer daily vehicle movement, ensure that more than 60% of the locomotive depots have locomotives that have reached more than 500 kilometers for five consecutive days, and save 10% of coal according to the budget standard. Other departments such as engineering, telecommunications, vehicles, factories, finance, materials, and health have also formulated specific conditions for the competition. It is also clearly stated that the production competition is not a temporary task, so it is necessary to ensure the normal progress of political, cultural, and technical studies. The call is to give full play to internal resources during the competition to ensure good quality and low cost, and to implement the idea of economic accounting.
　　National and public factories in Northeast China are determined to take practical actions to welcome the Labor Model Conference and National Day. Yang Kebing, chairman of the Anshan Federation of Trade Unions, called on all employees of Angang to overcome shortcomings in production and strive to improve quality and reduce costs. In the production competition to welcome National Day, national and public factories in Mudanjiang City took learning from the experience of the Ma Hengchang team and creating Ma Hengchang-style teams as the specific content. For example, the four teams in the foundry group of the machinery factory eliminated defective products, and the Tan Xingfu team in the lathe group cleaned the machines thoroughly. Jilin State-owned Paper Mill and Factory 41 launched a production competition in August. In order to welcome National Day, it is required to improve quality, implement the responsibility system, unite technical personnel, complete or complete the production tasks for August and September ahead of schedule, consciously cultivate typical groups, and promote the experience of the Ma Hengchang team. On August 18, the No. 1 paper machine of the paper mill created a new record of 33 hours of continuous paper production without a break, unprecedented in the factory.
　　All employees of the knitting factory of the Northeast China Department Store Company promised the trade union to exceed the production tasks for the third quarter and strive to reduce costs and produce no defective products. The factory's employees are designing and making the most beautiful treasure to present to the Labor Model Conference.
　　In early August, the trade union of the Sifang Railway Factory called on the factory to rush to build the first new locomotive since liberation as a gift to Chairman Mao for National Day. This was enthusiastically supported by all employees of the factory. The factory management committee and the workers' congress unanimously approved it. The factory's production planning department formulated a work plan and a detailed work schedule and sent them to the supply yards on August 17. All employees of the factory accepted this glorious task with incomparable excitement and began construction after detailed research and discussion. By the 19th, 60% of the new locomotive boiler had been completed. By the 23rd, more than 95% of the castings and forgings had been delivered. The workers are determined to build this locomotive with high quality, high efficiency, and long life. The minimum requirement when it leaves the factory is to make it run more than 150,000 kilometers (the average car is 100,000 kilometers), exceeding one Class A inspection period.
　　After the trade union of the Beijing Automobile Repair Factory called on the factory to complete the production tasks for September ahead of schedule and improve product quality to welcome National Day, all employees of the factory have taken active action. All workers in the forging workshop first challenged the entire factory, guaranteeing to complete the entire month's tasks five days in advance with good quality and no overtime. The rubber workshop guaranteed to complete the task one week in advance. Wang Zhong, a labor model of the factory, guaranteed to roll as much rubber as used and guarantee good quality. Other workshops also put forward their own specific conditions, all guaranteeing to complete the entire month's tasks before the 25th to welcome National Day.
