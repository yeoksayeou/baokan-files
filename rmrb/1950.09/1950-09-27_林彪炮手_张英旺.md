Lin Biao's Gunner – Zhang Yingwang
	Xi Hong

In this story of a hero, we can see how a child who herded sheep, in difficult circumstances, brought into play his courage and creativity, and how he built his heroic achievements.

A child from a shepherding background, from the first day he began his artillery life, always dreamed of becoming a brave gunner – cannons so big, fired out, boom, boom, all the enemies are buried; what could be more powerful than this?

However, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Eighth Route Army's heavy artillery was precious and rare weaponry, and firing even a single shell in battle was not easily permitted.

Time moved forward in victory. During the three-year Liberation War, the People's Liberation Army had already established a powerful artillery force. Our young gunner also became a strong artillery backbone. He started as one of six gunners, then learned the work of all six gunners. With the victory of the war, he led heavy artillery platoons, heavy artillery companies, and heavy artillery battalions, and equipped himself with 38-type mountain guns, then switched to 41-type mountain guns, and finally equipped himself with brand new American-style mountain guns. His comrades also became brave gunners under his training.

Isn't this obvious enough? A child from a shepherding background, because of his loyalty to the people's cause, could naturally create his own glory continuously.

Let us recall our hero. Three years ago, on the snowy Northeast battlefield, there was an artillery team rolling day and night in the steep Changbai Mountains. The gunners lived in the deep mountains and ate frozen clumps of ice. The artillery mules froze to death, and heavy artillery rolled down from the steep mountains... At that time, our hero was the leader of this artillery team. He traveled back and forth in front of the artillery team, sometimes helping everyone pull the artillery in the deep snow, sometimes checking whether the rain covers on the artillery were tightly packed. When necessary, he would assist the gunners in disassembling the gun body, pulling with ropes, and carrying with people, laboriously crossing mountains and ridges. Every time in battle, his artillery team was welcomed by the infantry because the shells they fired could accurately explode in front of the enemy.

It was precisely in the summer of 1947 that he was broadcast to the whole country with his heroic deeds, along with the glorious title of "Lin Biao's Gunner," by a Xinhua News Agency broadcaster.

This matter is almost astonishing. In a modern city – Meihekou, at a railway intersection, the enemy defended with heavy troops. The periphery of the city had dense "semi-permanent" fortifications. The infantry waited eagerly for their artillery brothers to clear the way for them. Before them were two old, toothless 41-type mountain guns. The gun bodies had left and right deviations, the gun sights were dirty, and they were unstable when firing. How could they hit the enemy? Look! In a sloping mountain depression, our artillery hero personally leveled the position. After aligning the two wheels horizontally, he quickly loaded several sacks of sand and pressed them against the front and back of the artillery wheels. The two wheels were also tied together with ropes, tightened, and a hemp rope was also pulled behind, nailed with pegs and pulled taut. With all preparations completed, they began to fire.

He selected several obvious targets, pointing to the red houses on the edge of the city and the deer-寨 bunkers about five hundred meters away, and told his comrades to fire. Boom, boom, boom, the red houses collapsed, and the bunkers and deer-寨 were blown away. The infantry then took advantage of the momentum and rushed up.

At this moment, the infantry approached the second layer of bunkers and could no longer advance. They were all lying on the flat, open ground, unable to go up or down, like a bullet stuck in the chamber. The situation was deteriorating every second.

"Zhang Yingwang!" This was the voice of the division commander. The division commander's command post was on the side of the artillery position. The division commander personally came here to find our hero.

"You first take out the heavy machine gun over there by the outer moat," the division commander said, sweating profusely. "Then take out that cement bunker in the bunker complex, and don't hit our own people!"

This was indeed a difficult task. There was nothing to hide in front of them, their own troops were almost entangled with the enemy, and enemy artillery fire was constantly exploding around the artillery, and the shields on the artillery were constantly being hit by shrapnel. It was truly infuriating.

"Let's try it, commander... we won't hit our own people."

"Quick, you fire it yourself!"

The division commander squatted to the side and watched attentively. Our hero immediately turned back and forth, and once again secured the artillery, and then calmly squatted behind the artillery, preparing to fire.

"Please observe carefully, commander. Firing begins."

With a boom, a shell flew out, and a puff of black smoke rose in front.

"Almost, adjust it a little more." The division commander shouted, holding binoculars.

After the second shell was fired, the heavy machine gun on the opposite side stopped firing. Along with a cloud of black smoke, the shattered heavy machine gun flew into the sky.

On the artillery position, the division commander clapped and cheered. His comrades also clapped and cheered. The infantry lying in front also sent back joyful shouts.

Immediately afterwards was the third shell. After the shell was fired, it went straight into the gun hole of that cement bunker. With a boom, the bunker exploded.

This time, the crawling infantry all jumped up and shouted as they rushed up. The division commander watched the troops go up, put down the binoculars, and said:

"Good, well done. I'll give you a special merit when we get back!"

Our hero didn't seem to hear the division commander's encouragement. Seeing that the enemy was in chaos and retreating, he began to fire in an extended manner, blowing the enemy into the city and escorting his own troops into the city. …

It is conceivable how good our hero is at displaying courage and creativity in difficult environments! The glorious title of "Lin Biao's Gunner" belongs precisely to such a hero. (Attached picture)

　　林彪炮手——张英旺
    西虹
    在这一个英雄的叙述里，我们可以看见一个放羊出身的孩子，怎样在艰难的环境中发挥他的勇敢和创造，怎样建成他的英雄的业迹。
    一个放羊出身的孩子，从他开始炮兵生活的第一天起，就时时梦想着当一个勇敢的炮手——炮弹那么大，打出去，轰隆轰隆，敌人全被埋葬，还有什么东西比这威力更大呢？
    可是，抗日战争那时候，八路军的重炮是宝贵难得的武器，战斗中打一发炮弹也是不能轻易允许的。
    时间在胜利中前进着，三年解放战争期间，人民解放军已经建立了强大的炮兵部队，我们年青的炮手也成了坚强的炮兵骨干。他先是六个炮手中的一个，以后学会了六个炮手的工作，随着战争的胜利，他领导着重炮排，重炮连，重炮营，并给自己装备了三八山炮，以后又换成四一式山炮，最后又装备了崭新的美式山炮，他的战友们也都在他培养下变成了勇敢的炮手。
    这还不够明显吗？一个放羊出身的孩子，由于他忠实于人民事业，他自然能够不间断的创造着自己的荣誉。
    让我们来回想一下我们的英雄，三年前，在风雪茫茫的东北战场上，有一支炮队日夜滚动在险峻的长白山脉，炮手们住的是深山，吃的是冰团，炮骡冻僵了，重炮从峻岭上滚翻下来……。那时，我们的英雄正是这一炮队的领导者，他穿行在炮队前后，一时帮着大家在深雪中拉炮，一时检点炮上的雨布包紧没有，必要的时候，他就协助炮手们卸开炮身，用绳拉，用人扛，艰难的翻山过岭。每次战斗的时候，他的炮队都为步兵所欢迎，因为他们发射的炮弹都能准确的在敌人面前爆炸。
    那正是一九四七年夏季，他以“林彪炮手”的光荣称号，被新华社的广播员将他的英雄事迹一起播送到全国。
    这事几乎是令人惊异的。在一个铁路交叉点的近代化城市——梅河口，敌人以重兵防守着，城市外围有着密密层层的“半永久性”工事，步兵眼巴巴等着炮兵兄弟为他们开路。眼前是两门老得没牙的四一式山炮，炮身左右偏差，炮镜污秽大，打起来不稳当，怎能命中敌人呢？看吧！在斜斜的山凹里，我们的炮兵英雄亲手修平了阵地，两轮水平对好以后，他赶快装了几麻袋沙土，顶在炮车轮前后，两轮之间又用绳子套住，鳔紧，后面也牵了条麻绳，钉上橛子扯住，一切准备妥当了，就开始发射。
    他选好几个明显的目标，指着城边的红房子，眼前五百米远近的鹿砦地堡，叫他的伙伴们打，轰隆隆，轰隆隆，红房子炸倒了，地堡、鹿砦炸飞了，步兵们便乘劲冲了上去。
    此刻步兵迫近第二层地堡再也不能前进，一个个伏在平坦的开阔地面，上不去，下不来，就像子弹壳卡膛，情况每秒钟都在恶化。
    “张英旺！”这是师长的声音。师长的指挥所就在炮兵阵地一边，师长亲自来这里找到我们的英雄。
    “你先把外壕那儿的重机枪打掉”，师长汗淋淋的说：“你再把地堡群的那个洋灰地堡打掉，不准你打着自己人！”
    这的确是困难的事，跟前一片溜平没有一点隐蔽，自己的部队差点跟敌人搅在了一起，敌方打来的炮火又不断在炮的周围爆炸，炮上的方盾也不时被弹片敲击着，真急人。
    “试一下吧，首长……自己人是打不着。”
    “快，你亲自打！”
    师长蹲在一边注目观察着。我们的英雄马上转前转后，又一次把炮绑稳，而后心平气和地蹲在炮的后面准备发射。
    “请首长注意观察吧，开始发射了。”
    轰隆一声，一颗炮弹飞出去，前面炸起一股黑烟。
    “差不多，再修正一下。”师长举着望远镜喊叫着。
    第二发炮弹出口之后，对面的重机枪不响了，随着一团黑烟，炸碎了的重机枪飞上了天空。
    炮阵地上，师长拍手喊好，他的伙伴们也拍手喊好。前面伏着的步兵，也向后传来高兴的喊叫。
    紧接着就是第三炮，炮弹出口之后，直向那个洋灰地堡的枪眼钻进去，轰隆一声地堡炸开了花。
    这一回，爬着的步兵都跳了起来，喊叫着往上冲去。师长望着步队上去了，拿开镜子就说：
    “好，打得好，回去给你记特功！”
    我们的英雄似乎没听到师长的鼓励，他见敌人乱了套，正往后退，便开始了延伸射击，一面把敌人吹到城里，一面把自己的部队护送到城里。……
    可以想见，我们的英雄是多么善于在艰难环境中，发挥勇敢和创造！“林彪炮手”的光荣称号，正是属于这样的英雄的。（附图片）
