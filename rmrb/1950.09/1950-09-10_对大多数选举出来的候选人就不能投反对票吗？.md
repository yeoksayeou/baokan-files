　　Can You Not Vote Against Most Elected Candidates?
　　To the Editor:
    Recently, when a section of the Beijing Film Manufacturing Factory held an election for "Model Workers," some comrades had opinions about individual candidates, feeling that they were not qualified to be model workers, and therefore were unwilling to vote for them in the vote. However, the section chief did not allow it. He believed that everyone participating in the election should vote in favor and not abstain or vote against.
    I will briefly describe the course of events at that time:
    On the day of the election of model workers, more than a dozen candidates were originally proposed at the section's general meeting. As a result of the vote, the entire section produced four official candidates. In the final vote, everyone was no longer voting freely, but rather voting in a compulsory manner, that is, for each of these four candidates, if you were unwilling to elect him as a Grade A or Grade B "Model Worker," you had to at least elect him as a Grade C model. At that time, many people felt that this approach was not in line with the principles of democratic elections. However, the section chief's explanation was: "Since more than half of the people have already raised their hands in agreement, then they should obey the majority." This means that: although you did not raise your hand when voting for someone just now, since more than half of the people have raised their hands, then you must also obey the majority and vote in favor of the person you do not agree with. The election ended in this atmosphere of "everyone voting in favor."
    I don't think this is appropriate. The principle of "the minority obeying the majority" is completely correct. But this certainly does not mean that "the minority obeying the majority" is equal to having 100% approval votes in every election. How can this be called democracy?
    My understanding of the meaning of "democracy" and "the minority obeying the majority" is this: When holding an election, everyone with the right to vote should have full freedom to vote for or against someone; but after the election is over, according to the principle of "the minority obeying the majority," even if the person elected is someone you voted against in the vote, you should recognize him. If the person elected is a leader, then you should also obey his leadership. This is what is called true democracy.

    Editor's Note: Democratic elections are one of the basic rights of the people. During elections, voters can vote in favor, against, or abstain from voting. This free right to vote must be implemented in any election to encourage the people's high level of enthusiasm for the various construction undertakings of the new China. If the election situation in a section of the Beijing Film Manufacturing Factory, as reflected by this newspaper reader, is entirely true, then the section chief's forcing others to vote in favor is an error of principle.

### 对大多数选举出来的候选人就不能投反对票吗？

　　对大多数选举出来的候选人就不能投反对票吗？编辑同志：
    最近北京电影制片厂某科在举行选举“模范工作者”时，有个别同志对个别候选人有意见，觉得他不够模范工作者的资格，因此在投票表决时不愿意对他投赞成票。但科长却不允许。他认为每个参加选举的人，都要投赞成票，不得投反对票或弃权。
    我把当时的经过情形简单地介绍如下：
    选举模范工作者那天，原在全科大会上提出了十几名候选人。表决的结果，全科产生了四个正式候选人。最后投票选举时，大家已经不是自由的投票，而是强制性的投票，即对这四位候选人中每一个人，你不愿选他作甲等或乙等“模范工作者”，至少也得选他为丙等模范。当时有很多人觉得这种作法是不合乎民主选举的原则的。但科长的解释却是：“刚才半数以上的人既已举手赞成，那么就应该服从多数。”这意思就是说：刚才举手表决某人时，你虽没有举手，但半数以上的人既已举手，那么你也就得服从多数而对你所不赞成的人投赞成票。选举就这样在“全体投票赞成”的情况下结束了。
    我认为这样做是不恰当的。“少数服从多数”的原则是完全正确的。但这决不是说：“少数服从多数”就等于每一次选举都得有百分之百的赞成票。这如何能叫民主呢？
    “民主”及“少数服从多数”的意义，据我的理解是这样的：在举行选举时，赞成某人或反对某人，每个有选举权的人都应该有充分的自由权利；但选举结束，根据“少数服从多数”的原则，当选的即使是你在表决时曾投反对票的人，你也应该承认他。如果被选出的是领导者，那你还应该服从他的领导。这样才叫做真正民主。
    北京电影制造厂一读者
    编者按：民主选举，是人民群众的基本权利之一。在选举时，投票人可以投票赞成、反对，或放弃投票权。这种自由的选举权，必须贯彻到任何一种选举中，以鼓励人民群众对新中国各种建设事业的高度积极性。本报读者反映北京电影制片厂某科的选举情形如果全部属实，则该厂某科长强制别人投票赞成，是一种带原则性的错误。
