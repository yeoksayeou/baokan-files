Cheng Baifu, who attended the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, is from Sang'erzhuang Village, Eleventh District, Lin County, Pingyuan Province. His parents died early in his childhood. He lived with his uncle, herded sheep for four years, and worked as a hired farmhand for nineteen years, suffering from the exploitation and oppression of landlords. After the liberation of Lin County in 1942, he immediately led the masses to struggle against the landlords. After the land reform, he led the masses in production. Now he is the beloved leader of the people of Sang'erzhuang village and a member of the Communist Party of China. Because he led the masses of Sang'erzhuang village to produce, overcame the famines and difficulties of the past years, and specifically implemented the production policies of the Party and the government, he was unanimously praised as a banner in agricultural production in the province at the first Labor Model Conference of Pingyuan Province in January this year, and was selected as a special-class labor model in the province.

Organized and Planned
	His first method of leading production is to be organized and planned. Every year in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, he formulates a production plan for the whole village based on the specific situation of each season. After the branch discusses and approves it, it is studied by the People's Representative Conference and made into a resolution. Then, he convenes party member meetings, Youth League member meetings, and mass meetings to call on party members, Youth League members, and activists to take the lead in production and launch a mass production movement. During production, he actively helps the masses solve specific difficulties, and regularly checks production, commending the good and criticizing the bad. Whenever production work comes to an end, he immediately summarizes the experience, elects models, and plans the next stage of work. For example, last spring, in order to respond to the government's call to "increase production by 10%," he often mobilized the masses to accumulate more fertilizer. Last year, when planting grain, the whole village applied 32,000 dan of manure. After the grain grew, he mobilized the masses to dismantle old walls and replace them with new walls, and accumulate house soil fertilizer for top dressing. By autumn, the agricultural production income of the whole village exceeded that of 1948. The whole village harvested 42 more shi of grain, with an average yield increase of more than 1.6 dou per mu. After the autumn harvest, he seized the opportunity to educate the masses. He asked everyone to think about where the increased grain came from. When everyone felt that more manure would result in more grain, he called on the masses to accumulate more fertilizer for planting wheat.
	Under his planned promotion and leadership, the masses of the whole village have overcome many difficulties, and their income has increased year by year. For example, in 1945, Sang'erzhuang suffered a hailstorm. He led the masses of the whole village to grow vegetables and organize mutual aid for sideline production. By the end of the year, they not only survived the disaster but also earned 420,000 yuan. The masses reflected, "We didn't eat chaff in the disaster year, and it was even better than a good year." They also said, "If we listen to Cheng Baifu, we are not afraid of anything."
	The production of Sang'erzhuang is developing day by day, which can also be seen from the increasing number of livestock year by year. Before the Anti-Japanese War, Sang'erzhuang had a total of 116 livestock. Due to the looting by the Japanese invaders during the Anti-Japanese War, the whole village was reduced to 38 livestock by 1945. However, after the land reform, the enthusiasm of farmers for production increased, and Cheng Baifu took the lead in production, so the number of livestock increased year by year. By 1948, it had increased to 126, exceeding the pre-war level. Last year, it increased to 162, and this year it has increased to 212. All of this is inseparable from Cheng Baifu's organized and planned leadership of production.
	Cheng Baifu's organization and planning of production are carried through every production link throughout the year. In production, he found that some middle peasant households did not understand the government's production policy and dared not actively develop production, so he often specifically promoted the government's production policy to them, explaining that the land reform had been completed, and the government resolutely protected the people's human rights, land rights, and property rights. The masses believed his words, their concerns were relieved, and they actively carried out production. The whole village increased its livestock by 40 and built more than 100 new houses in the first half of this year. He not only regularly educated and persuaded individual farmers who did not work hard, but also often helped them hold family meetings to review the reasons why they were not doing well and formulate production plans, so that they went from being unwilling to work to actively producing.
	Cheng Baifu also constantly wrote his experience in leading production to newspapers and disseminated it to the whole province through newspapers.

Taking the Lead and Setting an Example
	Cheng Baifu's second method of leading production is to take the lead in setting an example everywhere and promote production in the whole village. This spring, when the government called for weeding wheat, the masses in this village had never had the habit of weeding wheat, so he took the lead in weeding and often publicized the benefits and experience of weeding, launching a village-wide wheat weeding campaign. The masses in all eight streets of the village carried out wheat weeding together, weeding 1,586 mu of wheat in three days. In less than half a month, the wheat fields in the whole village were weeded twice, and one-third was weeded three times. When planting grain, the masses did not have the habit of soaking and mixing seeds, fearing that the seeds would be burned. In response to the concerns of the masses, he publicized the benefits of soaking and mixing seeds, and made examples for everyone to see. He helped the masses soak seeds from house to house, teaching more than 200 households how to soak seeds. When weeding seedlings, he saw that 80 male laborers in the village went out to engage in sideline production, so he mobilized 80% of the women in the village to participate in weeding seedlings. He patiently taught many women who did not know how to weed seedlings.
	The climate and soil of Lin County are suitable for growing cotton, but the masses have no habit of growing cotton. In order to respond to the government's call, he put forward slogans to mobilize everyone to grow cotton in the year before last, and planted one mu of cotton in his land on the side of the road to educate the masses with practical facts. Last year, under his leadership, the village planted 171 mu of cotton, and this year it has planted 240 mu.

Pay Attention to Improving Production Technology
	Cheng Baifu also attaches great importance to agricultural technology. In the past, wheat in his village was always plagued by jaundice and smut disease. In order to find out the cause, he asked people and cadres everywhere. Later, he found that the seeds were not good, so he first replaced all of his wheat seeds, and after seed selection, soaking and mixing, his wheat grew very well, without black mold, without jaundice, and with large ears. When harvesting wheat, he led the masses to visit his field, and everyone saw the facts and began to believe in the benefits of seed selection and soaking. He further mobilized the masses to carry out field seed selection. Last year, wheat that was selected, soaked and mixed did not develop disease this year. When harvesting wheat this summer, 312 of the 336 households in the village carried out field seed selection. After the wheat harvest, he gave a soaking experiment at the district representatives' meeting on his experience in implementing seed selection and soaking. Thirty-one villages have learned Cheng Baifu's soaking method.

　　领导生产的能手成百福
    鲁生
    出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的成百福，是平原省林县十一区桑耳庄村人。从小父母早亡，跟着伯父过日子，放过四年羊，当过十九年长工，受尽了地主的剥削和压迫。一九四二年林县解放后，他即领导群众和地主斗争；土地改革后，他又领导群众搞生产。现在他是桑耳庄全村人民所敬爱的领袖，是中国共产党党员。由于他带领桑耳庄全村群众生产，战胜了历年来的灾荒和困难，具体的贯彻了党和政府的生产政策。今年一月平原省第一届劳模大会上，大家一致称赞他是全省农业生产中的旗帜，选他为全省特等劳动模范。
  有组织，有计划
    他领导生产的第一个办法是有组织有计划。他每年在春、夏、秋三季中，都要根据每季的具体情况，制订出全村生产计划，经过支部讨论通过，再经过人民代表会研究后做成决议，然后即召开党员会、团员会、群众会，号召党团员和积极分子在生产中带头，掀起群众性的生产运动。进行生产中，又积极帮助群众解决具体困难，并按期检查生产，表扬好的，批评坏的。每当生产工作告一段落时，他立刻总结经验，选举模范，又计划进行下一段工作。如去年春天，他为了响应政府“增产一成”的号召，经常动员群众多积肥，去年种谷时全村就上到三万二千担粪。谷子长起后，他又动员群众拆旧墙换新墙，积屋土粪上追肥，到秋天全村的农业生产收入，即超过了一九四八年。全村多打四十二石粮，平均每亩增产一斗六升多。收秋后他又抓紧时机教育群众，他让大家想想：谷子打的多是从那里来的？到大家感到上粪多就能多打粮食时，他就号召群众多积肥种麦子。
    全村群众在他有计划的推动领导下，克服了许多困难，收入一年比一年增加。如一九四五年，桑耳庄遭了雹灾，他就领导全村群众种菜，组织互助搞副业生产，到年底不仅度过了灾荒，还获利四十二万元，群众反映说：“过灾荒年没吃糠，还比丰年时光强。”又说：“听了成百福的话，啥也不害怕。”
    桑耳庄的生产是一天一天在发展着，从牲口的逐年增加上也可看出来。抗战前桑耳庄共有牲口一百一十六头，因在抗战中受日寇的抢掠，到一九四五年，全村即减少到三十八头。但土地改革后农民生产情绪的提高，成百福的积极带头生产，牲口即逐年增加，到一九四八年即增加到一百二十六头，已超过战前水平，去年增加到一百六十二头，今年又增加到二百一十二头。这都是和成百福有组织有计划领导生产分不开的。
    成百福领导生产的组织性和计划性是贯串在全年每一个生产环节中的。在生产中他发现有个别中农户因不了解政府生产政策，不敢积极发展生产，就每天专找他们宣传政府的生产政策，说明土地改革已经完成，政府坚决保护人民的人权、地权、财权。群众相信他的话，顾虑解除了，积极进行生产，全村在今年前半年即增加牲口四十头，盖新房一百多间。他对个别不好好生产的农户，不但经常进行教育说服，还常常帮助他们开家庭会议，检讨日子过不好的原因，制订生产计划，使他们从不愿劳动到积极生产。
    成百福还不断把自己领导生产的经验写给报社，通过报纸传播到全省。
  带头起模范作用
    成百福领导生产的第二个办法是处处带头起模范作用，推动全村进行生产。今春政府号召锄麦时，因这村群众过去一贯没有锄麦习惯，他就首先带头去锄，并经常宣传锄麦的好处和经验，掀起了全村的锄麦运动。全村八个街群众一齐进行锄麦，三天就锄麦一千五百八十六亩，不上半月全村的麦地即普锄两遍，有三分之一还锄到三遍。种谷时群众没有浸种拌种的习惯，怕把种籽烧坏。他针对群众的顾虑，一面宣传浸种拌种的好处，一面作出实例给大家看，他挨家帮助群众浸种，教会了二百多户群众学会浸种。锄苗时他看到全村有八十个男劳力出外搞副业，他就发动了全村百分之八十的妇女参加锄苗，他耐心的教会了许多不会锄苗的妇女。
    林县气候、土质都适合种棉花，就是群众没有种棉的习惯。他为了响应政府的号召，在前年时就一面提出口号发动大家种棉花，一面又在他大路边的地里种了一亩棉花，用实际事实教育群众。去年在他带头下，全村种棉一百七十一亩，今年即种到二百四十亩。
  注意改进生产技术
    成百福对农业技术也特别重视。他村的麦子过去断不了发生黄疸、黑疸病，为了研究清楚原因，曾到处问人问干部。后来发现是种子不好，他就先把他的麦种全部换了，又经过选种浸种拌种，结果他的麦子长的很好，没有乌霉，没有黄疸，穗子又大。收麦时他带领群众到他地里去参观，大家看到了事实，开始相信了选种浸种的好处。他就进一步发动群众进行田间选种。去年凡是选种浸种的麦子，今年都没有发生病。今夏收麦时，全村三百三十六户中有三百一十二户做到田间选种。麦收后，他又把他实行选种浸种的经验在全区各界代表会上作了浸种试验，有三十一个村都学会了成百福的浸种办法。
