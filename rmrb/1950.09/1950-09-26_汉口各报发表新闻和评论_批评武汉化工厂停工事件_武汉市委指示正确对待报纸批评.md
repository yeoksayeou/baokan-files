Xinhua News Agency: To enable the Communist Party, the People's Government, and its cadres to establish a correct attitude towards newspaper criticism, the Hankou Changjiang Daily and Dagang Daily prominently published a report on August 31 concerning the Changjiang Daily's handling of news criticizing the shutdown of the state-owned Wuhan Chemical Plant. Both newspapers published the Changjiang Daily Editorial Department's letter to the Central-South Military and Political Committee's People's Supervision Committee, the Central-South People's Supervision Committee's letter supporting the expansion of newspaper criticism, the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee's decision supporting the Changjiang Daily's criticism of the Wuhan Chemical Plant, and the self-criticism of those criticized. Both newspapers also published editorials on the incident.

The incident unfolded as follows: Due to poor management, blind production, disconnect between production and sales, and poor quality, the state-owned Wuhan Chemical Plant experienced shutdowns in its soap, engine oil, and glass departments. The Changjiang Daily published critical news and commentary on May 28th. However, Song Mengming, Director of the Wuhan Municipal Industrial Bureau, and other responsible personnel resisted criticism, arguing that criticism of state-owned factories by newspapers should only be conducted internally. They believed that publicizing such criticism would "damage the factory's prestige," "harm the factory's sales," and "be tantamount to calling for the factory's collapse." On the same day the Changjiang Daily published the news, Song Mengming summoned the reporter for questioning, denying the basic facts of the criticism and repeatedly nitpicking on minor issues like incorrect dates, demanding the newspaper make immediate corrections. Later, he even forced the chemical plant's management to intimidate workers against approaching the reporter and, under the pretext that the newspaper's criticism affected the factory's business, attempted to incite workers' dissatisfaction with the reporter. To correctly handle this issue, the Changjiang Daily invited relevant departments for discussions. In addition to upholding the correct opinions it had put forward, it made self-criticism regarding some inaccuracies in the news. The newspaper also sent the materials to the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee for review and sent a letter to the Central-South People's Supervision Committee, outlining the newspaper's approach to handling reader criticisms of government agencies or individuals in the future. The newspaper proposed that in the future, on the same day a critical article is published, a letter will be sent directly to the criticized party, along with a clipping of the original criticism, requesting a response within a certain period. If the response is delayed for too long, it will be announced in the newspaper. If the criticized agency or individual deliberately delays responding or handling the matter, the newspaper will not only submit the matter to the criticized agency or individual's superior leadership for handling but also report it to the Central-South Military and Political Committee's Supervision Committee. This approach has been approved by the People's Supervision Committee. The Supervision Committee also put forward specific measures, stipulating that for leading organs of the government and public servants involved in serious violations of policies and laws and damage to the interests of the state and the people, if a reader submits a responsible contribution, the newspaper reviews and publishes it, and the criticized party refuses to express an attitude or ignores it after the procedures stipulated by the Changjiang Daily, it can be formally transferred to the committee for handling. However, if it involves general issues, it will be transferred to the criticized party's direct superior leadership for handling; if it falls within the scope of judicial matters, it will be transferred to the procuratorial organs for handling.

The Wuhan Municipal Party Committee also convened a meeting on August 16 to discuss the incident and make a decision. The decision pointed out: (1) Industrial Bureau Director Comrade Song Mengming and Comrade Fu Ziying, the relevant person in charge of the bureau, should immediately conduct public self-criticism. The Municipal Government Organs Party Committee should review past instances of resisting criticism and suppressing criticism, draw conclusions, and make a public statement. (2) All Party members and Party organizations must not engage in any unreasonable resistance or suppression of criticism from the people's newspapers. (3) The masses have the freedom to criticize shortcomings in their work and to express their opinions in the people's newspapers. All Party committees must re-discuss and review the implementation of the Central Committee's "Decision on Unfolding Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" and report to the Municipal Party Committee. Units that have been criticized by newspapers (Construction Bureau Engineering Team, Municipal No. 1 Hospital, etc.) should immediately conduct earnest self-criticism. Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee of the CPC, also published an article suggesting that Party member cadres treat their attitude towards newspaper criticism as one of the contents of the current rectification campaign.

　　汉口各报发表新闻和评论
    批评武汉化工厂停工事件
    武汉市委指示正确对待报纸批评
    【新华社讯】为使共产党和人民政府及其干部树立对待报纸批评的正确态度，汉口长江日报、大刚报于八月三十一日都以显著地位刊载长江日报处理批评公营武汉化工厂停工新闻的报道。两报都刊载了长江日报编辑部给中南军政委员会人民监察委员会的信、中南人民监察委员会支持报纸展开批评的复函、中共武汉市委会关于支持长江日报对于武汉化工厂所做批评的决定，以及被批评者的检讨等文件。两报并对这次事件发表社论。
    这次事件的经过是：公营武汉化工厂由于经营不善，盲目生产，产销脱节，品质低劣等原因，致所属肥皂、机油、玻璃三部先后停工。长江日报于五月二十八日为此发表了批评性的新闻和评论；但武汉市工业局局长宋孟明等负责人员抗拒批评，认为报纸对公营工厂的批评，只可在内部进行，一经公开发表，则“有损该厂的威信”，“打击了该厂的销路”，“无异叫化工厂垮台”。宋孟明在长江日报将该项新闻刊出的当天，就把记者叫去责问，否认批评的基本事实，只抓住日期不对等枝节问题反复挑剔，要报社立即更正；以后还迫使化工厂管理人员威吓工人不要接近记者，并借口报纸批评影响该厂营业，企图挑起工人对记者的不满。长江日报为正确的处理这一问题，曾邀请有关部门进行了座谈，除坚持该报所提正确的意见外，对新闻中某些失实之处作了自我批评；并将材料送至中共武汉市委会研究，同时致函中南人民监察委员会，提出该报今后处理读者对政府机关或个人批评稿件的办法。该报提出今后在发表批评稿件的当天，即直接给被批评者去信，并附批评原文的剪报，要求被批评者于一定时期内作答复；如超过时间太久而不回信，即在报纸上公布；如被批评的机关或个人故意拖延不复或处理，报社除送交被批评机关或个人的上级领导机关处理外，并向中南军政委员会监察委员会提出检举。这项办法已得到人民监察委员会的同意。监察委员会并提出具体办法，规定对于政权领导机关与公务人员，有涉及严重违犯政策法令和损害国家人民利益事件，经读者负责投稿，报社审查公布，并经过长江日报所提办法规定的程序，而被批评者拒绝表示态度或置之不理时，可正式转交该委员会处理；但如系一般问题，则转交被批评者直接上级领导机关处理；如系属司法范围，则转交检察机关处理。
    中共武汉市委会对这次事件也于八月十六日召开市委会讨论，并作出决定。决定指出：（一）工业局长宋孟明同志和该局有关负责人傅子英同志都应即进行公开检讨。市府机关分党委应检查以往抵抗批评和压制批评情况，作出结论，公开发表。（二）全体党员、党的组织对于人民的报纸所提批评，不能作任何无理抵抗或压制批评的行为。（三）群众对工作中所存在的缺点，有批评的自由，也有在人民报纸上发表言论的自由。各党委必须将中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”，重新讨论并检查执行情况，报告市委会。已受到报纸批评的单位（建设局工程队、市立第一医院等）应立即进行切实检讨。武汉市中共市委会书记张平化并发表文章，建议党员干部将对待报纸批评的态度，作为目前正在进行的整风的内容之一。
