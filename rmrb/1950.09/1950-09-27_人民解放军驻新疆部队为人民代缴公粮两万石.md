Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 25th. The Xinjiang Provincial People's Government announced earlier this month that the province's autumn grain levy for this year is 400,000 "lao dan" (one "lao dan" equals 470 jin). According to the province's financial budget for this year, the total grain needed for the whole year was more than 700,000 "lao dan." However, the Central People's Government, in consideration of Xinjiang being a multi-ethnic region that suffered for many years under the Kuomintang reactionary government and whose people live in hardship, specially approved a reduction. The shortfall will be subsidized by the Central People's Government purchasing grain produced by the People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang from their land reclamation efforts. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang also proposed to the Provincial People's Government to use their production income to pay public grain for the people of all ethnic groups, amounting to 20,000 shi. Regarding this autumn grain levy task, at the seventh meeting of the Provincial People's Government Committee, Chairman Burhan, Vice Chairman Saifuddin, and all members pointed out that this burden is very light and expressed confidence that they would be able to complete the task quickly. They especially thanked all the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army Xinjiang Military Region on behalf of the people of Xinjiang.

　　人民解放军驻新疆部队为人民代缴公粮两万石
    【新华社西安二十五日电】新疆省人民政府本月上旬公布该省今年秋征公粮额为四十万老担（一老担等于四百七十市斤）。根据该省今年财政概算，全年原共需公粮七十余万老担，但中央人民政府为照顾新疆是多民族地区，多年遭受国民党反动政府的摧残，人民生活艰苦，故特准予减轻。不足部分，由中央人民政府拨款向人民解放军驻新部队购卖其开荒生产的粮食予以补助。人民解放军驻新部队并向省人民政府提出，愿将其生产所得为各族人民代交公粮两万石。关于此次秋征公粮任务，在省人民政府第七次委员会议上，鲍尔汉主席、赛福鼎副主席及各委员都指出，这个负担是很轻的，并表示一定有把握很快地完成任务。他们特别代表新疆人民向人民解放军新疆军区全体指战员致谢。
