In mid-June, I wrote an article criticizing the machine repair factory for failing to complete its production tasks. Before publication, I received a letter from Wang Yang, the factory director of the machine repair factory, to the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee (it is not clear here, the Fushun Municipal Party Committee may have forwarded Director Wang Yang's letter to the newspaper - editor), disagreeing with the criticism of the factory's work in May, believing that it was "inconsistent with the facts." And said that the main reason for the failure to complete the task was: "Security inspections disrupted the central work." In order to further understand the production situation of the machine repair factory in the first half of the year, the reporter went to the factory again to exchange opinions with workers, technicians, administrative management cadres, and Party workers. The worker comrades all believed that the criticism was correct. However, this interview work encountered unexpected difficulties: because Director Wang had announced to the entire factory at a cadre meeting in mid-June: "In the future, if everyone provides materials to newspaper reporters, if they are inconsistent with the facts, the individual will be fully responsible, and the materials provided should be based on the factory's summary speech" (the general idea is like this). This approach is inappropriate and essentially restricts reporters' interviews. But I still received encouragement and help from the factory's working comrades, which enabled me to deeply understand the reasons for the factory's frequent accidents and low quality, and I used these materials to supplement my article.

The machine repair factory has developed to more than 1,300 employees since its construction a year ago. Lathes, iron furnaces, gantry planers, electric hammers and other equipment are of considerable scale. The factory's work has achieved certain results. However, at present, due to the bureaucratic work style of administrative leading cadres, production has not yet been on the right track.

The quality of products is not good. Products are not scientifically inspected when they leave the factory, but are only evaluated by "eyesight." Therefore, some people reflect: this is "inferior goods." For example, two pulleys were made for the oil factory, but they were reworked twice because they did not meet the standards. Two hundred automatic shoe head parts for locomotives were made for the vehicle factory. They should have been made of white cast iron, but gray cast iron was used. The planning section made a mistake in the plan, and the inspection section did not check it out. As a result, the vehicle factory could not use them and returned them all. Seven hundred and fifty pounds of steel ingot molds were made for the steel factory, but less than 2% were completed in half a year. Some finished products became scrap iron before they left the factory. Forty percent of the steel ingot molds leaving the factory have pinholes. The oil factory urgently needed salted iron plates, which should have been delivered in March, but have not yet been completed. The loss is alarming.

Accidents occur constantly, and machine losses are serious. According to statistics in the first half of the year, there were 72 mechanical equipment accidents and 168 injury accidents. On May 7, the electric hammer in the finished product workshop broke down, and work was suspended for 27 days. In the last ten days of June, the cast iron workshop had five consecutive responsibility accidents of solidification of three-ton iron furnaces, with losses of one billion yuan in Northeast currency.

The reasons for the above phenomena are: (1) Lack of systems and lax discipline. There is no clear system for working hours, and various safety production responsibility systems are also unsound. The handover book in the riveting and welding field is hung on the wall, but not a word is written on it; the lathe field has not been implemented since July. A squad leader said: "It's the same whether you hand it over or not. Only the squad leader stamps it. Workers don't know what the handover book is for, what the tools and machines are like." There are often 30 workers absent from work every month, and the attendance rate has averaged 92% in the past six months. In production, there is no special responsibility system for checking material consumption and product quality; although a special responsibility system has been established for machines, there is no specific guarantee, because some workers are afraid of taking responsibility, and management cadres think it is "troublesome." The leadership has not yet investigated the responsibility for the three-ton iron furnace solidification accident. No one cares about lost work and waste. Therefore, machine management is even worse. The lathe is unstable and vibrates severely when it is started, and the shaft is easily damaged; the machine is not often wiped and oiled, and the damage is serious.

(2) Poor planning. The department that checks the finished products does not even have inspection standards and plans. When undertaking the leather belt pulley for the oil factory, it did not follow the requirements and time plan, averaging two sets per group, but only one was made. And the quality is not good, and it needs to be redone (the plan was corrected after the workers raised their opinions). When manufacturing chain plates, procedures such as shearing, punching, flattening, and tempering are required, but the most important tempering procedure is ignored. The shortcomings found in basic construction projects are even more serious. The roof of the forging workshop was built and dismantled, and then dismantled and rebuilt; the small railway was laid and then dismantled, and then dismantled and relaid. The heating ditch collapsed before it was used, and the two boilers used for insulation have not been repaired for more than a year.

(3) Unclear rewards and punishments. There have been only five rationalization proposals in the past six months. The experience of certain inventions and creations has not been summarized and promoted in a timely manner. The leadership did not give any rewards for the workers' transformation of foreign iron gates. Luo Yufang, the squad leader of the lathe field, proposed specific shift handover methods and systems, but has not received a response after a month. Workers said: "Other factory workshops have blackboards, but our factory doesn't." "We only know that others are good, and we want to learn, but we have no way to learn." Workers generally feel that rewards and punishments are unclear, and it is the same whether you do well or badly. Riveter Lang Tingyuan said: "It's the same whether you come to work early or late, whether you do well or badly."

Completing tasks only relies on overtime, without thinking about improving operating methods and improving technology.

(4) Bureaucratic leadership methods. When the administration convenes workers for a general meeting, it only requires them to complete tasks, and rarely educates them on how to ensure the completion of tasks. Although the factory director has a division of labor, they do not communicate with each other and do things their own way. Director Wang does not often go to the site to understand the situation. When experienced veteran workers were assigned to take charge of the iron furnace, the factory director did not consult with the workers, but only issued an "order": "The furnace operation of the iron melting furnace has been designated to Deputy Director Zhang (newly transferred) to be responsible, and other personnel shall not interfere with the furnace operation. Those who do not abide by the system and arbitrarily act or interfere with the furnace operation shall be regarded as sabotaging production." However, after the order was posted, two more solidification accidents occurred (this problem was solved through everyone's efforts).

Therefore, improving leadership methods, relying on all employees, and implementing democratic management are the basic keys to the machine repair factory's good production.

　　《机修厂事故多质量低的原因在那里》原文
    鲁渤
    六月中旬，我写了一篇批评机修厂没完成生产任务的稿件。发表前接到机修厂汪洋厂长给市委宣传部的一封信（此处未说清楚，可能是抚顺市委将汪洋厂长的信转到报社——编者），不同意对该厂五月份工作的批评，认为“与事实不符”。并说任务未完成的主要原因是：“保安检查打乱了中心工作”。记者为了更进一步了解机修厂上半年的生产情况，即再去该厂和工人、技术人员、行政管理干部、党的工作同志交换意见。工人同志都认为提出批评是对的。但这次采访工作遇到了料想不到的困难：因为汪厂长在六月中旬的干部会议上曾向全厂宣布：“今后大家向报社记者供给材料，倘与事实不符，完全由个人负责，同时供给材料时要根据工厂的总结发言”（大意如此）。这种作法是不妥当的，实质上就是限制记者采访。但我还是得到了该厂工作同志的鼓励和帮助，使我深入了解了该厂事故多、质量低的原因，并用这些材料补充了我的文章。      
     作者
    机修厂建设一年以来，职工已发展到一千三百余人。旋盘、铁炉、龙门刨、电锤等设备都具有相当大的规模。该厂的工作是有一定成绩的。但目前，由于行政领导干部有官僚主义作风，致使生产还未走上正轨。
    产品质量不好。产品出厂时也没有经过科学检验，仅凭“眼力”评定。因此有人反映：这是“劣货”。例如给制油厂作滑轮两个，因不合标准返工两回。给车辆厂作机车用自动靴头零件二百个，本应用白铸铁铸造，但使用了灰铸铁，计划股计划错了，检查股也没检查出来。结果车辆厂不能使用，把它们全部退回来了。承做制钢厂七百五十斤钢锭模子，半年内完成不到百分之二。有的成品没出厂就成为废铁。出厂的钢锭模子百分之四十有砂眼。制油厂急用的加咸铁板，三月份应交货，但至今还未作完。其损失是惊人的。
    事故不断发生，机器损失严重。上半年统计：发生机械设备事故七十二次；伤害事故一百六十八次。五月七日成品车间的电锤坏了，停工二十七天。六月下旬六天中铸铁车间曾连续五次发生三吨铁炉凝固的责任事故，损失达十亿元东北币。
    发生上述现象的原因，是由于：（一）缺乏制度，纪律松懈。工作时间没有明确的制度，各种安全生产责任制亦不健全。铆焊场的交接簿挂在墙上，上面没写上一个字；旋盘场从七月间开始就未执行。有一个班长说：“交不交都一样，光班长盖戳，工具和机器究竟怎样，工人都不知道交接簿有啥用。”每月经常有三十个工人旷工，出勤率半年来平均百分之九十二。在生产中，对材料消耗及产品质量的检查没有专责制；对机器虽建立了专责制，也没有具体保证，因有的工人怕负责任，管理干部则嫌“麻烦”。三吨铁炉凝固事故，领导上至今也没追究责任。误工废活谁也不过问。因此，机器管理更坏，旋床不稳，开动时震动得很厉害，轴容易坏；机器不常擦、不常浇油，损坏严重。
    （二）计划不周。检查成品的部门，连检查标准和计划都没有。承作制油厂皮带轱辘，不按要求条件和时间计划，平均每组作两个，结果只作一个。而且质量不好，又需重作（经工人提出意见后才改正了计划）。制造链板时要经剪切、冲眼、压平、沾火等手续，但却把最重要的沾火手续忽视了。在基本建设工程上，发现的缺点更为严重。锻造场房盖了拆，拆了又盖；小铁道铺了又拆，拆了又铺。暖气沟没等使用就塌倒了，保暖用的两台锅炉一年多还未修理好。
    （三）奖惩不明。半年来仅有合理化建议五件。对某些发明创造没有及时总结经验加以推广。对工人改造洋铁门子事，领导也没有给予奖励。旋盘场班长罗玉芳提出三班倒的具体交接班办法和制度，一个月后还没得到答复。工人说：“别厂车间都有黑板报，就是咱厂没有。”“光知道人家好，我们想学，无从学起。”工人普遍感到赏罚不明，干好干坏都是一样。铆工郎廷原说：“早晚上下班，好坏都一样”。
    完成任务只靠加班加点，不想法改进操作方法和提高技术。
    （四）官僚主义领导方法。行政上召集工人开大会时，只是要求完成任务，很少教育工人如何保证任务完成。厂长虽有分工，但互不联系，各搞一套。汪厂长也不经常深入现场了解情况。配备有经验的老工友去掌握铁炉时，厂长不与工人商量，只下了一道“命令”：“化铁炉的炉上作业，已指定张副主任（新调去的）负责，其他人员不得干涉炉上工作。如有不遵守制度，任意动手或干涉炉工操作者，按破坏生产论。”但命令贴出后，又连续发生两次凝固事故（经过大家的努力才解决了这个问题）。
    因此，改善领导方法，依靠全体职工，贯彻民主化管理，乃是机修厂搞好生产的基本关键。
