World Federation of Democratic Youth Representatives at Peking University
　　Chen Youwei

　　The warm sunshine bathed the entire Peking University.

　　At the school gate and on the square, students eagerly awaited the arrival of their respected brothers and comrades-in-arms—the representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

　　At 4:15 p.m., the representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, headed by Bugala, arrived at Peking University accompanied by Comrades Wu Xueqian and Qu Tangliang. Immediately, thunderous applause and cheers erupted from the ranks of young welcomers. Amidst the singing of "The East is Red," a song already familiar and beloved by the representatives, they received flowers from the students and then went to "Zimin Hall" for a brief rest, where Mr. Tang Yongtong, Director of the Peking University Affairs Committee, gave a brief introduction to the history and current situation of Peking University.

　　At 4:50 p.m., the representatives divided into three groups and visited the Red Building, the library, and the Geology Building. During the visit to the former "Chairman Mao's Studio" in the Red Building, the representatives expressed great concern and interest. They grasped every word and every character explained by the translator and carefully noted it in their notebooks. From those faded early progressive publications of the Chinese People's Revolution and from historical pictures and documents, the representatives saw the early days of the Chinese People's Revolution, which was conceived thirty years ago under the influence and inspiration of the Russian October Socialist Revolution.

　　After the visit, the representatives attended a forum in the front yard of "Zimin Hall," where Peking University students reported on the history of Peking University, the heroic anti-American and anti-Chiang Kai-shek struggles carried out by the students before liberation, how they greeted liberation, and the New Democratic study they had undertaken under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government after liberation.

　　At 6:10 p.m., the resounding song "Unity is Strength" echoed across Democracy Square. The representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth were greeted and brought out to participate in the program arranged by the students to welcome them. The first program was the collective dance "Unity is Strength." Two years ago, in the years ruled by the American and Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries, the song "Unity is Strength" united tens of thousands of young students, who waged heroic and unyielding, resolute and decisive struggles against the Kuomintang reactionaries in the movements against hunger, persecution, and civil war. The majestic song and firm steps inspired and strengthened the students' confidence in the struggle. Today, when American imperialism is carrying out shameless armed aggression in the Far East, thus threatening world peace, on Democracy Square, the birthplace of the student movement, the students are again using the song "Unity is Strength" to welcome democratic youth representatives from all over the world. The representatives happily and naturally participated in the collective dance, advancing with the students with firm and powerful rhythm and steady, uniform steps. This song of struggle has not only united the entire young generation of China today but also united the vast progressive youth of the world, advancing towards the same lofty goal—lasting peace.

　　After the entertainment program, the representatives accepted gifts from the Peking University students. While accepting the gifts, Ike Betani, the representative of the International Union of Students and the Iranian Democratic Youth, delivered a speech on behalf of the International Union of Students and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, saying: "Peking University has a glorious tradition of revolutionary spirit. The students of Peking University, together with the Chinese students and the Chinese people, have been fighting for the liberation of China since the May Fourth Movement and the December 9th Movement. The Chinese students have now become an important factor in defending world peace…. I represent five million progressive students around the world in paying tribute to the Chinese students!" When he finally shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" and "Long live Stalin!", the students responded with warm applause.

　　As dusk approached, the students bid farewell to the representatives of the World Federation of Democratic Youth with joyful and excited hearts, singing "The World Democratic Youth March."

　　世界青联代表在北大
    陈有为
    和煦的阳光沐浴着整个北大。
    在校门口，在广场上，同学们殷切地等待着他们所敬爱的兄弟与战友——世界民主青年联盟的代表到来访问。
    下午四时十五分，以布加拉为首的世界青联代表，在吴学谦与区唐亮等同志的陪同下，来到北大。年青的欢迎者的队伍中，立刻响起了雷动般的掌声与欢呼声。在已经为代表们所熟悉与喜爱的“东方红”歌声中，代表们接受了同学们的献花，随后即至“孑民堂”小憩，由北大校务委员会主任汤用彤先生简单地介绍北大的历史与现在的情形。
    四时五十分，代表分成三个小组，分赴红楼、图书馆与地质学馆参观。在参观红楼从前“毛主席工作室”时，代表们表示莫大的关切与兴趣。他们紧紧地抓住了翻译同志所解释的每一句话与每一个字，仔细地记在本子上。从那些已经褪色的中国人民革命初期的进步刊物上、历史性的图片与文件上，代表们看到了三十年前因受俄国十月社会主义革命的影响与感召而孕育了的中国人民革命初期的情形。
    参观完毕后，代表们参加了在“孑民堂”前院子里举行的座谈会，会上北大同学分别报告了北大的历史、同学们在解放以前所进行的反美反蒋的英勇斗争情形、如何迎接解放、以及解放以后在共产党与人民政府领导下所展开的新民主主义学习的情形。
    六时十分，民主广场上响起了嘹亮的“团结就是力量”的歌声，世界青联代表被迎接出来参加同学们为欢迎他们而安排的节目。第一个节目就是集体舞“团结就是力量”。二年以前，在美蒋反动派所统治的年月里，“团结就是力量”的歌声团结了成千成万的年青同学，在反饥饿、反迫害、反内战的运动中，与国民党反动派进行着英勇不屈，坚决果敢的斗争，雄壮的歌声与坚定的步伐，鼓舞了加强了同学们的斗争的信心。当今天美帝国主义在远东进行无耻的武装侵略因而使世界和平遭受到威胁的时候，在这学生运动发源地的民主广场上，同学又以“团结就是力量”的歌声来欢迎来自世界各地的民主青年代表。代表们愉快地自然地参加了集体舞，随着坚定而有力的节奏，踏定整齐的步伐与同学们一起前进，这一斗争的歌声今天不但已团结了中国的整个青年一代，而且还团结着广大的世界进步青年，为着崇高的同一目标——持久和平而前进。
    余兴节目后，代表们接受了北大同学的献礼。在接受礼物时，国际学联代表、伊朗民主青年代表艾克贝塔尼代表国际学联与世界青联致谢词，他说：“北大有着光荣的革命传统精神。北大的学生与中国学生在一起，与中国人民在一起，从“五四”与“一二九”以来，为中国的解放而斗争。中国的学生今天已经成为保卫世界和平的重要的因素了……。我代表全世界五百万进步学生向中国学生致敬！”当他最后高呼“毛泽东万岁！”、“斯大林万岁！”的时候，同学们报以热烈的掌声。
    黄昏来到的时候，同学们以愉快、兴奋的心情，高唱起“世界民主青年进行曲”，欢送了世界青联代表们。
