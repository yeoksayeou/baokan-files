Wang Shiyi is from Nangang Village, Fourth District, Mianyang, Hubei, and works as a doctor. During the Japanese occupation, he served as a medical officer in the puppet army unit of Wang Buqing.

The Wang family is a large clan in Nangang, and Wang Shiyi is the clan chief. In the past, he consistently oppressed the people of the entire village and dominated the area. According to preliminary investigations, his crimes are as follows: (1) He seized a pasture outside the North Dike of Xiqi Courtyard. People from other villages who wanted to cut grass had to pay him. (2) In 1943, when the Shan Du was repaired in Xiqi Courtyard, he served as the supervisor and collected a total of 700 shi of rice from the five villages of Nangang, Hejiabang, Dakou, Xiliuhe, and Yaomaoling for the repairs. However, he embezzled the rice collected, and many Du were not properly repaired. (3) During the land revolution, he colluded with reactionary forces to kill our working comrade (the father of Wang Niuji). (4) He still rules Nangang Village; even the village chief does not dare to collect his public grain, and the masses do not dare to oppose his black land. (Originally published in the Changjiang Daily on August 21st)

Editor's Note: From the above material, it appears that Wang Aimin, in order to protect his father who had committed evil acts as a local bully, even wrote a letter to threaten the village peasant association, losing the position of a revolutionary soldier. This is a matter of principle and a mistake. It is hoped that the responsible comrades of the Political Department of the 15th Army Corps will thoroughly investigate the truth of the incident and handle it seriously. Wang Aimin should make a public reply in the newspaper.

　　王士益的罪行初步调查
    王士益是湖北沔阳四区南港村人，行医。日寇占领期间，曾充当伪军汪步青部医官。
    南港王姓是大族，而王士益是该族的族长，过去一贯压迫全村人民，独霸一方。据初步调查，其罪行如下：（一）霸占西圻大院北堤外的一片草场，外村群众去打草时，非给他草钱不行。（二）一九四三年四西大院修单剅时他当督办，在南港、何家帮、大口、西流河、鸭毛岭五村，共收修米七百石。但所收米被他贪污了。许多剅未修好。（三）土地革命时，他勾结反动势力害死我工作同志（王牛吉的父亲）。（四）现仍统治南港村，村长连他的公粮都不敢征收，他的黑田，群众也不敢反。（原载八月二十一日长江日报）
    编者按：从上面的材料看来，王爱民为了庇护有恶霸行为的父亲，竟写信威胁村农会，失掉革命军人的立场，这是原则性的错误。希望十五兵团政治部负责同志彻查事件真相，严正处理。王爱民应在报纸上作公开答复。
