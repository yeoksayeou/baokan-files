Xinhua News Agency, September 9th: TASS Moscow reports: *Pravda* published on the 5th a dispatch from its Pyongyang correspondent, Bo Qianke, entitled "As I See It," describing the homicidal atrocities of the American aggressors.

Bo Qianke wrote: During the war, I had been to Warsaw, Auschwitz (in Poland), Madanik (in Yugoslavia), and Lites (in Czechoslovakia, all cities where Nazi bandits massacred Eastern European people). I can say this: in terms of the ability to massacre and destroy, Truman is no less than Hitler. Truman is determined to turn Korea into a large-scale killing field. Captured American pilot Leaf Chay confessed during interrogation: "General Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, ordered us to turn Korea into a desert." The commander of the US Air Force in Korea, Pike, once gave American planes the nickname of "winged meat grinding machines." His name has been included in the list of war criminals compiled by the Korean people based on preserved records of atrocities, and these names are spoken by their compatriots. In Seoul, I saw horrifying places. I saw walls pierced by bullets and gallows designed by Washington engineers. Since the gallows could not be used for mass executions, and there were not enough soldiers to shoot people, the Americans adopted devilish and sinful methods: the Americans ordered typhoid patients, who were prevalent in Seoul at that time, to be sent to the prison, so that they became tools for executing prisoners. The bodies of those hanged, shot, and died of typhoid were thrown down the cliff, and then the Americans exploded the rocks and covered up the crime with gravel.

In the newly liberated South Korean villages, we saw many heads of Korean patriots, chopped off by the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) gang, hanging on telephone poles, obviously to intimidate the residents. We saw simple and clear US military orders nailed to the trees: "Those who do not retreat to the south will be killed without exception." The American aggressors carried out the orders of their superiors and shot three hundred students who refused to collude with the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) gang.

Near Kimcheon, the US military dragged young women from various villages, forced them to drink a strong wine, and then raped them. Afterwards, these unfortunate insulted women were dragged into a train tunnel and machine-gunned to death.

On the "road of death"—the name given by American prisoners to the road from Seoul to the front line—no city or village has been spared due to the day and night bombing by American aircraft. Thirty American Flying Fortresses continuously bombed Yecheon, a town with 5,000 residents, for three hours. Everything was burned in flames. Not a house or a tree was still intact. More than 3,000 people were bombed to death, more than 1,000 were bombed and burned, and the rest fled to the mountains without clothing or food. In this way, all the villages on this road were burned down, but the bombing continued, and piles of charred things and rubble accumulated every day. The scarlet flames illuminate Korea.

Bo Qianke wrote in conclusion: The Korean people preserve accurate records of atrocities and have made a list of war criminals. These records, written under the bloody light of bombs, will become evidence in the international trial of American war criminals.

### 要把朝鲜变成大规模的杀人场  杜鲁门屠杀朝鲜人民  真理报报道美军在朝鲜暴行

　　要把朝鲜变成大规模的杀人场
    杜鲁门屠杀朝鲜人民
    真理报报道美军在朝鲜暴行
    【新华社九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：《真理报》于五日发表该报驻平壤记者波诚科的题为《如是我见》的通讯，描述美国侵略者的杀人暴行。
    波诚科写道：在战时，我曾到过华沙、奥斯维西姆（在波兰）、马达尼克（在南斯拉夫）和利台斯（在捷克，以上均为纳粹匪徒屠杀东欧人民的城市）。我可以这样说：就屠杀和毁灭的本领而论，杜鲁门并不逊于希特勒。杜鲁门一心要把朝鲜变成一个大规模的杀人场。被俘的美军驾驶员李夫柴在被审讯时供称：“美国第八军军长瓦克命令我们把朝鲜变成一个沙漠。”美国侵朝空军司令派克曾经给美国飞机起了一个“长着翅膀的碎肉机器”的浑号，他的名字已经被包括在朝鲜人民根据保存着的暴行记录所编成的战犯名单中，这些名字都是他们的同胞说出来的。在汉城，我看过了骇人的地方。我看见被子弹射穿的墙，还看见华盛顿工程师所设计的绞架。绞架不能用来大批处决，也没有那么多士兵来枪杀人，于是，美国人就采用了魔鬼般的罪恶手段：美国人下令把那时汉城流行的伤寒病人送到监狱来，这样，他们就成了处决囚犯的工具。被绞死、枪杀和死于伤寒病的人的尸体，被抛下悬崖，然后美国人爆炸了岩石，用碎石掩盖住这一罪迹。
    在新解放的南朝鲜的村子里，我们看到许多被李承晚匪帮砍下来的朝鲜爱国志士的头颅挂在电线杆上，这显然是用来恫吓居民的。我们看到树上钉着的简单明了的美军命令：“未向南方撤退者，格杀勿论。”美国侵略者就执行了他们上级的命令，曾经枪毙了三百名拒绝与李承晚匪帮同流合污的学生。
    在金泉附近，美军把各村庄中的年青妇女拖出来，强迫她们喝一种烈性的酒，然后加以强奸。事后，这些不幸被侮辱的妇女被拉进火车隧道里，用机枪扫射死。
    在“死亡的道路”——美俘对从汉城到前线的这条路的称呼——上，由于美机的日夜轰炸，已没有一座幸免的城市或村庄。三十架美国飞行堡垒连续不断地轰炸了有五千居民的醴泉达三小时之久，一切都在火焰中焚毁，没有一幢房子，没有一棵树还完整地存在。三千多人被炸死，一千多人被炸伤、烧伤，其余的人都逃到山中去，无衣无食。就是这样，这条路上的所有村庄都被焚毁，但是轰炸还在继续着，每天都累积起一堆堆烧焦的东西和瓦砾。血色的火焰照耀着朝鲜。
    波诚科在结语中写道：朝鲜人民保存着暴行的精确记录，制成了战犯的名单。这些在炸弹血光下写成的记录，将成为国际审判美国战犯时的证据。
