Xinhua News Agency, New York, 31st: According to an Associated Press report from New York, the U.S. Communist Party's newspaper, the Worker's Daily, published an editorial on the 28th commenting on U.S. Navy Secretary Matthews' speech on the 25th, which clamored for launching an aggressive war, stating that when Matthews said the United States was willing to launch a war if necessary, he was stating the policy of the U.S. government. The editorial, referring to the U.S. State Department's denial that Matthews' speech represented U.S. policy, asked: "Can anyone believe that a Secretary of the Navy would publicly express an opinion on the most pressing issue of our time without the agreement of the President who appointed him and his colleagues?" The editorial emphasized: "Matthews' speech may seem to contradict the hypocritical words of the President, the State Department, and the Department of Defense, but Matthews' speech is perfectly in line with their actions."

    评马休斯演说
    【新华社三十一日讯】据美联社纽约消息：美国共产党机关报工人日报二十八日发表社论，评论美国海军部长马休斯二十五日叫嚣发动侵略战争的演说称：当马休斯说美国在必要时甘愿发动战争时，他道出了美国政府的政策。社论在提到美国务院否认马休斯演说代表美国政策时问道：“难道任何人能相信，一位海军部长对于我们这个时代的最紧要的问题，能公开发表一项意见而不为任命他当部长的总统和他的同僚所同意吗？”社论着重指出：“马休斯的演说看来似乎是和总统、国务院与国防部的假惺惺的辞句相矛盾的，但马休斯的演辞和他们的行为是完全符合的。”
