 Thirty-six, The Party's Opinion

　　After the farewell party, Representative Zhang and the branch secretary urged Guo Shude to convene a group meeting to discuss joining the Party as soon as possible. Guo Shude was even more anxious when he returned, and he was especially happy when the old hero came to see him. He patted the old hero on the shoulder and said:
    “You should have done this a long time ago, but it's not too late now!”
    “I'm afraid it's still not good enough, right?” The old hero was always so careful and considerate in all aspects.
    "It will be! It would have been fine long ago! Wait a moment, we'll have a meeting in a while."
    Guo Shude was very busy: this meeting was not casual, it had to be solemn, with arrangements and preparations. He had already talked to several Party members, and also talked to Hu Chundong and Xiao Zhu. Before the meeting, he had to talk to Lao Shang and Lao Zheng separately, at least to let them understand the significance of today's meeting. …
    In the evening, this solemn meeting was held in the crew rest room.
    After everyone said a few words, they stopped talking again.
    Lao Shang and Lao Zheng spoke even less today, they hardly said anything, and both of them looked very nervous.
    The old hero was particularly talkative today. Seeing that everyone was silent, he couldn't help himself and said:
    “In the past, when Guo Dache (Guo, the driver) asked me, I always shirked. For decades, I have been suffering, and I can't trust anything. The Communist Party is good, but I always feel like I can't quite figure it out, I'm always afraid that in case... in case it's not the case!"
    Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The old hero continued:
    "Later I figured it out, and I also saw it accurately, but I felt guilty myself. To be honest, I still eat for myself, and I can't say I'm serving the people. Later, when I saw Guo Dache, ah! I hope that this time when we enter the pass, everyone will learn from Guo Dache."
    His words were a bit chaotic, but everyone understood what he meant, and they were all so silent, including the young Hu Chundong and Xiao Zhu. Ordinary workers don't easily have such silence.
    “I have a suggestion,” Yue Shangwu and Zheng Dugong said almost at the same time: “Let’s ask Guo Dache to talk about himself…”
    "Talk about what?"
    “Talk about how he has progressed so fast?” Lao Zheng said: “How did he join the Party as soon as he was liberated? What happened after joining the Party? Please tell us everything, otherwise how can we learn from him?”
    This proposal was particularly welcomed. “A good suggestion! A good suggestion!”, “Please let Guo Dache talk!” Everyone asked in unison.
    “Tell us in detail, from beginning to end, from the source.” The old hero added this sentence.
    Eight pairs of eyes stared at Guo Shude.
    "I can talk about other things," Guo Shude said, "But I can't talk about this." Everyone still wanted him to talk, and to talk in detail.
    Party members Yue Shangwu, Wang Qingquan, Zhao Haisheng, etc. also urged him with their eyes: Just talk, you should talk.
    "You must talk, I have nothing to talk about myself, I can only talk about the Communist Party."
    "That's what we want you to talk about, the Communist Party."
    "If I talk about the Communist Party, I can only talk about Representative Song, Representative Zhang, and others,"
    Lao Shang said:
    "I'm the first to approve of talking about Representative Song."
    Guo Shude thought: Anyway, I have to talk. …
    “We workers are all about the same,” he began: “Everyone is poor. My family used to be poor peasants in the countryside of Bayan (County), Songjiang (Province). My father couldn’t support the whole family by farming. After the ‘September 18th’ Incident, we moved into the city to do small business, and I went to junior high school. Later, I couldn’t afford to go to school, so I went to work. First, I sold tickets on the bus, but there was no future, and I was bullied by the Japanese devils. In less than a year, I came to the locomotive depot to take the exam and became a carriage cleaner. In 1942, I became a fireman.
    “On April 28, 1946, Harbin was liberated. I was twenty-four years old at that time. We are all the same. Which worker was not oppressed in the old society? Whose thinking was not for working to eat, and working for eating. Some people said the Communist Party was good, some people said the Liberation Army was bad. I didn't believe any of it, I wanted to see it with my own eyes. Sure enough, the Liberation Army was all very kind, but they were not well-dressed. More than a month later, on June 15th, a workers' training class was established. At that time, the military representative was Representative Bai. He wanted me to be trained, and I was very scared. I was not afraid of anything else, I was still unsure about the Communist Party and the Liberation Army. The fifteen-day training was very good, it talked about the two classes in the world, who the Kuomintang and the Communist Party represented, and also talked about the history of the arduous war of resistance, which was very exciting. It also said that from now on, the status of workers would be improved, I was half-believing and half-doubting, I had not seen the facts, and I was not sure in my heart. After graduation, I was assigned to the locomotive depot workers' self-defense force as an instructor to protect the factory and warehouse. At that time, there were many spies and bad guys, this work was very important, and I also felt that the workers were playing a role in protecting their own railways. I was very interested in the work, and I worked very hard. At that time, the captain of the railway work team, Captain He, saw that I was very good and wanted me to join the Party. I said I didn't understand anything, and I had many shortcomings, how could I join the Party? At this time, I saw that the Communist Party was good, because Representative Bai and Captain He were both good, I guessed that these two must be Party members, so how could I compare with them? So I said I would not join. Captain He said that everyone from the old society has shortcomings, and only by joining the Party can they quickly get rid of their shortcomings; moreover, the Communist Party is the political party of the working class, and workers should join even more. He said that the Communist Party was the political party of the working class, and I didn't fully believe it at that time, but I thought it was almost true that joining the Party could get rid of shortcomings, so I agreed to join. I wrote my autobiography immediately, and it was officially approved on September 13th, with a one-month probationary period. After that, I would have a group meeting once a week to criticize and examine myself. This thing is powerful, it can cure anyone, I think the Communist Party is indeed good, very different from the old society.
    “The self-defense force was disbanded, Representative Bai left, and Representative Song replaced him. At that time, I had already been on locomotive No. 1911, which later became the Zhu De locomotive. The day after Representative Song came, he talked to me and asked me what difficulties I had. Because he was an amateur in the railway, he wanted to understand the work and often asked me. He was really careful and kind, no one could compare with him. I only admired him, and did not look down on him.”
    He took a breath and paused.
    People were fascinated by listening, and as soon as he paused, everyone urged him to continue.
    “In October,” Guo Shude continued, “in order to complete the winter transportation, a two-month competition was launched. Representative Song looked for me even more frequently. Before the train left, he told me to play a guarantee role and never have an accident. At that time, it was all military transport, and it was all old cadres. Strangely enough, those old cadres were all similar to Representative Song, they told me how General He (He Long) fought the world with two kitchen knives, and told me heroic stories of the war of resistance to encourage me to work hard to drive. As soon as the locomotive came back, Representative Song looked for me again to talk, no matter day or night, I can't remember how many times we talked, I was really moved! I thought, the Communist Party has such cadres, so they can succeed. It was during that time that I prevented three major accidents, and therefore I was awarded a special merit. Those three accidents were all done at the risk of my life! I ask you, who is not afraid of death? Before liberation, who would not risk their lives to drill into the fire room? If you asked me to drill, I wouldn't drill either. But at that time I was indeed not afraid of death, I thought this was much easier than the Five Heroes of Langya Mountain jumping off a cliff to sacrifice themselves, that was clearly jumping down to die, but the Five Heroes would rather die than surrender! What kind of will is that? That is—I couldn't say it at that time, but after these two years I can say it, that is completely the will of the Party!
    “Comrades,” he said excitedly, “the greatness of the Communist Party lies here!”
    No one spoke for a long, long time. (Attached picture)

  三十六、党的意见
    欢送会以后，张代表和支部书记就催郭树德赶紧开酝酿入党的小组会。郭树德回来更着急，正好老英雄去找他，他特别高兴。拍着老英雄的肩膀说：
    “你早就该这样，不过现在还不迟！”
    “怕还不行吧？”老英雄总是那么细心谨慎八面考虑的。
    “行！早就行！等一等，一会儿咱们就开个会。”
    忙坏了郭树德：这个会不是随随便便开的，要郑重，要有布置，有准备。他早就跟几个党员谈过了，胡春东和小朱也谈了，开会之前还得找老商和老郑分别谈一谈，至少要让他们了解今天这个会的意义。……
    傍晚，在乘务员休息室里，这个郑重的会进行着。
    各人说了几句后，大家又不说话了。
    老商、老郑今天说话更少，简直没有说什么，两个人的脸都很紧张。
    老英雄今天却分外爱说话，一见大家沉默，他就蹩不住，他又说了：
    “以前郭大车找我，我总是推托。几十年了，我一直受苦，我对什么也信不住。共产党好是好，但我总觉得摸不大清，我总怕万一……万一又不是那么回事！”
    大家都透出一口气来。老英雄继续说：
    “后来我摸清了，也看准了，可是自己又心虚。说实在的，我还是吃饭为自己，说不上为人民服务。后来我一见郭大车，啊呀！我希望这次进关，大家都要向郭大车看齐。”
    他的话有点乱，但大家都懂得他说的是什么意思，一个个都那么沉默，年轻的胡春东和小朱也是一样。一般工人是不轻易有这样的沉默的。
    “我提个意见，”岳尚武和郑笃恭几乎同时这样说：“咱们请郭大车来讲讲他自己……”
    “讲自己什么？”
    “讲他怎么进步这样快？”老郑说：“怎么一解放就入了党？入党以后又怎么样？都请他讲一讲，要不咱们怎么向他学习啊？”
    这一提议受到特别的欢迎。“提得好！提得好！”，“请郭大车讲一讲！”大家连声要求。
    “要详详细细前前后后源源本本的讲一讲。”老英雄加了这一句。
    八双眼睛都盯住了郭树德。
    “别的还能讲，”郭树德说：“这个我可讲不上来。”大家还是要他讲，而且要他详细讲。
    党员岳尚武、王清权、赵海盛等也用眼色催他：讲就讲，应该讲。
    “一定要讲，我自己是没有什么讲的，只能讲讲共产党。”
    “就是要你讲共产党。”
    “我讲共产党也只能讲讲宋代表、张代表他们，”
    老商说：
    “讲宋代表我第一个赞成。”
    郭树德想：反正不讲不行啦。……
    “咱们工人都差不多，”他开始了：“个个都穷。我家原先在松江（省）巴彦（县）乡下，是贫农。父亲种庄稼养不活全家。‘九一八’以后就搬进城，做小买卖，我上高小。后来上学也上不起了，就做工。先在汽车上卖票，没有前途，又受日本鬼子的气。不到一年，就到这儿机务段考上擦车工，四二年当了司炉。
    “四六年四月二十八日哈尔滨解放，那时我二十四岁。咱们大家都一样，在旧社会哪个工人不受压迫？哪个人的思想不是为了吃饭才做工，做工为了吃饭。有人说共产党好，有人讲解放军坏，我一概不相信，我要亲眼见着才是真。果然，解放军都和和气气，就是穿的不好。过了一个多月，到六月十五号，成立工人训练班。那时候军事代表是白代表，他要让我去受训，我挺害怕。不怕别的，对共产党解放军我还摸不着底。受训十五天很好，讲世界两个阶级，国民党共产党都代表谁，还讲艰苦抗战的历史，挺带劲。又说从今以后工人地位提高了，我半信半疑，没有见到事实，心里不敢确定。毕业鉴定，就派我到机务段工人自卫队当指导员，保卫工厂和仓库。那时候特务坏家伙很多，这个工作很重要，我也觉得工人起了作用，自己保卫自己的铁路。工作很有兴趣，我很卖力气。当时铁路工作队何队长看我很好，就要我入党。我说我什么也不懂，缺点很多，怎么能入党？这时我看出来共产党是不错，因为白代表何队长都不错，我猜这两个人准是党员，那我怎么能和他们二人比？所以我说我不入。何队长说，凡是旧社会来的人都有缺点，只有入了党才能很快把缺点改掉；何况共产党是工人阶级自己的政党，工人更应该加入。说共产党是工人阶级的政党，那时我还不全信，要说入了党能改掉缺点，我看倒差不多少，我就答应入。当下写了自传，九月十三号正式批准，候补期一个月。以后就一星期开一次小组会，批评检讨。这东西厉害，能把什么人也治好了，我看共产党确不错，跟旧社会大不一样。
    “自卫队解散，白代表走了，换了宋代表。那时候我已经上了一九一一号车，就是后来的朱德号。宋代表一来第二天就找我谈话，问我有什么困难。因为他对铁路是外行，要了解工作，经常找我问我。那真是细心，真是和气，谁也比不上。我光佩服，没有看不起他的。”
    他歇了歇气，停了停。
    人们听得入了迷，他一稍停，大家就催他快讲。
    “到了十月。”郭树德继续说道：“为了完成冬运，展开两个月的竞赛。宋代表找我就更加勤了。车没有走以前，他嘱咐我要起保证作用，千万不要出事故。那时候净是军运，碰来碰去净是老干部。说也怪，那些老干部都跟宋代表差不多，给我讲贺老总（贺龙）两把菜刀打天下，给我讲抗战英勇故事，鼓励我努力开车。机车一回来，宋代表又找我谈，不论白天，不论黑夜，也记不清谈过多少次，我真感动！我想，共产党有这样的干部，所以才能够成功。我防止三次重大事故就是那时候的事情，因此立了特等功。那三次事故都是豁着命干！我问你们，谁不怕死？解放以前，谁不要命钻过火室？叫我钻我也不钻。可是那时候我确乎不怕死，我想这总比狼牙山五壮士跳崖牺牲容易得多，那是明明跳下去就是死，可是五壮士宁死不投降！那是什么意志？那是——那时候还说不上来，过了这两年我能说了，那完全是党的意志！
    “同志们，”他有些激动：“共产党的伟大就在这里！”
    人们谁也不说话，好久好久。（附图片）
