　　Xinhua News Agency, 20th: The first National Conference on Workers' and Peasants' Education, jointly convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, opened grandly in Beijing on the 20th after several months of preparation. This conference will discuss issues concerning workers' and peasants' spare-time education, workers' and peasants' cultural supplementary schools, and workers' and peasants' accelerated secondary schools, and will formulate various specific implementation measures. More than 500 representatives from all parties are participating in the conference, including responsible persons from education departments at all levels of government, trade unions at all levels, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Women's Federation, responsible persons from various industrial management departments and major enterprises, as well as worker-peasant learning models and model teachers. Minister Ma Xulun of the Central Ministry of Education said in his opening speech: China's heroic and hardworking workers and peasants created China's history and civilization, but in old China, they were deprived of the right to enjoy culture and education. The victory of the great people's revolution has given workers and peasants the political status as the foundation of the country, as well as the political right to enjoy formal education at all levels. He said that the basic tasks of worker-peasant education at present are, on the one hand, to carry out literacy campaigns in a planned and step-by-step manner according to the actual conditions of various regions, and gradually reduce illiteracy among the worker-peasant masses; on the other hand, to carry out cultural education for worker-peasant cadres in order to cultivate worker-peasant intellectuals. At the current stage, worker-peasant education should generally focus on literacy and cultural learning, while also carrying out political current affairs and production technology learning.
    Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, Lin Boqu, Secretary-General of the Central People's Government Committee, Vice Premiers of the Government Administration Council Dong Biwu, Guo Moruo, and Huang Yanpei, Vice Minister of Heavy Industry He Changgong, and Vice Minister of the Central Ministry of Culture Ding Xielin also spoke successively. They all pointed out that this conference is of great significance and is a historic conference, the first time in Chinese history that the education of workers and peasants has been brought to the national agenda. Vice Minister of Heavy Industry He Changgong also proposed that he will guarantee 100% implementation of the resolutions of this conference in the heavy industry sector and will compete with the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the Ministry of Railways.
    Before the opening of the conference, a two-day preparatory meeting was held, during which representatives from government education departments and trade union cultural and educational departments from various regions, together with worker-peasant model teachers and learning models, made 18 typical experience and problem reports, helping the attending representatives to consider and understand the problems in worker-peasant education more fully, so as to carry out heated discussions during the conference.
    The conference is expected to last ten days and will close on the 29th.

　　全国工农教育会议隆重开幕
    会议将讨论关于工农的业余教育、文化补习学校和速成中学等问题，并制定具体实施办法。
    【新华社二十日讯】中央人民政府教育部和中华全国总工会联合召集的第一次全国工农教育会议，经几个月的筹备，于二十日在北京隆重开幕。这次会议将讨论关于工人和农民的业余教育、工农文化补习学校和工农速成中学等问题，并将制定各种具体实施办法。参加会议的各方代表共五百多人，包括各级政府教育部门、各级工会及青年团中央、全国妇联的负责人，各产业管理部门及各大企业负责人，以及工农学习模范与模范教师等。中央教育部马叙伦部长在致开幕词时说：中国英勇、勤劳的工人和农民，创造了中国的历史和文明，但在旧中国，他们却被剥夺了享有文化和教育的权利。伟大的人民革命的胜利，使工人、农民取得了作为国家基础的政治地位，也取得了享受各级正规教育的政治权利。他说，目前工农教育的基本任务，一方面是根据各地区的实际情况，有计划有步骤地开展识字运动，逐步减少工农群众中的文盲；另一方面是进行工农干部的文化教育，以培养工农知识分子。工农教育在现阶段一般应以识字和学习文化为主，同时进行政治时事和生产技术的学习。
    中央人民政府副主席李济深，中央人民政府委员会秘书长林伯渠，政务院副总理董必武、郭沫若、黄炎培，重工业部副部长何长工、中央文化部副部长丁燮林等都相继讲话。他们都指出此次会议，意义重大，是中国历史上第一次将工农的教育问题提到国家的议事日程上来的历史性的大会。重工业部副部长何长工并提出他将在重工业部门中百分之百地保证执行这次大会的决议，并将与燃料工业部、铁道部竞赛。
    会议在开幕前曾举行两天预备会，由各地政府教育部门与工会文教部门代表，与工农模范教师、学习模范分别作了十八个典型经验与问题的报告，帮助到会代表较多地考虑与了解工农教育中的问题，以便在大会期间展开热烈的讨论。
    会议预计十天，将于二十九日闭幕。
