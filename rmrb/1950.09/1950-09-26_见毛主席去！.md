"Going to see Chairman Mao!"

Ma Tianqi

"Going to see Chairman Mao!" What an honorable thing! For Liang Jun, this ideal is about to become a reality. The members of the Mengya School's tractor team elected her to attend the National Congress of Labor Heroes of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

Liang Jun stood there blankly, tears welling up in her eyes. She was so excited that she couldn't speak.

In the past, when she attended the Provincial People's Congress, the Northeast Youth League Congress, and the Asian Women's Representative Conference, she was very excited and happy, but not to the point of being speechless.

"Child, work hard, and one day you will be able to see Chairman Mao!"

Three years ago, Principal Gao Heng encouraged her like a loving mother, patting her shoulder. This sentence gave her infinite strength.

For three years, rain or shine, she never complained. Whether in the scorching heat of summer or the bitter cold of winter, she rarely left her beloved tractor. That tractor was a weapon for developing the frontier of the motherland and an indispensable teaching tool for lectures. If she and her team members cherished gasoline as much as their own blood, then they cherished the tractor as much as their own lives!

In the spring of 1949, when her tractor was reclaiming the virgin land at Sandaogang in Dedu County, it lost a screw. She and her team members lined up and knelt on the oily, newly reclaimed virgin land, moving forward little by little to search. As a result, their knees were rubbed raw and bleeding, but what did that matter? In order to build the motherland and develop its frontier, she and her classmates once slept in leaky melon sheds, awake all night. In the late autumn and early winter of 1947, in order to build houses with their own hands, she and her classmates, as soon as the sky was dimly lit, walked barefoot on the ice shards to the river bend ten miles away, where the water was knee-deep. That water, in the words of the students, was "truly piercingly cold!" When they came out of the water, the cold wind blew on their legs, and they watched as cracks opened like locust mouths, with blood seeping out from inside.

These drops of blood constitute her glory.

This is not only Liang Jun's personal glory but also the glory of Mengya School and the glory of all teachers and students. ...

After the election, it should be the time for the principal to speak or make a summary. Everyone's eyes were on Comrade Gao Heng; he must have a lot to say. But he lowered his head, silently wiping his eyes with a handkerchief, and only raised his head after a long time, the shadow of a smile mixed with tears, indicating that he was extremely excited. He said slowly in a low tone:

"Going to see Chairman Mao is a major event! Comrade Liang Jun, on behalf of all our teachers and students, please convey our regards for his health!"

### “见毛主席去！”

　　“见毛主席去！”
    马天启
    “见毛主席去！”这是多么光荣的事情！在梁军说来，这一理想眼看就要变为现实了。萌芽学校的拖拉机队队员，都选举她出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议。
    梁军呆呆地站在那里，眼眶里滚动着晶莹的泪珠。她激动得说不出话来了。
    过去，她出席省人民代表会议、东北青年团代表大会，亚洲妇女代表会议时，她都是十分兴奋、十分愉快，但都没有兴奋、愉快到说不出话来的程度。
    “孩子，好好干吧，有一天能见毛主席去！”
    三年前，高衡校长像慈祥的妈妈，拍着她的肩膀这样勉励过她。这句话给她以无限的力量。
    三年来，风里来，雨里去，她从来没有叫过苦。无论是在炎阳炙人的盛夏，寒风刺骨的严冬，她很少离开过她那心爱的拖拉机。那台拖拉机是开发祖国边疆的武器，又是讲课时不可缺少的实物教具。如果说她和她的队员们珍爱汽油像珍爱自己的血浆，那么她们爱护拖拉机就像爱护自己的生命！
    一九四九年春，她那架拖拉机在开垦着德都县三道岗上那块处女地时，丢掉了一个螺丝钉。她和她的队员们，便一字儿排开，用膝盖跪在那油腥腥地被开垦的处女地上，一点点向前挪动着寻找。结果，膝盖磨破了，出血了，但这又算得什么呢？为了建设祖国、开发祖国的边疆，她曾经和同学们睡在漏雨的瓜窝棚里，彻夜不眠。在一九四七年的秋末冬初，为了自己动手盖房子，天刚朦朦亮，她和同学们便赤着脚，踏着冰碴，走到十里外水深没膝的河套里去。那水呀，用同学们的话说：“真是刺心凉！”从水里走出来的时候，冷风吹在腿上，眼看着裂开蚂蚱口，血水便从里面渗了出来。
    这些血水就构成了她的光荣。
    这不只是梁军个人的光荣，同时也是萌芽学校的光荣，全体师生的光荣。……
    选举完了，应该是校长发言或做总结的时候。大家的眼睛都望着高衡同志，他一定有很多话要讲。但是他低着头，默默地用手巾擦着眼睛，很久才抬起头来，笑影泪光混在一起，说明他是兴奋到极点了。他以低沉的调子缓缓地说道：
    “见毛主席去，这是一件大事！梁军同志，你代表我们全体老师和同学问候他的健康！”
       ——一九五○、八、二十五齐北线车厢里。
