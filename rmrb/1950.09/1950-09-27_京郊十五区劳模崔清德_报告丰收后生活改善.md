Labor Model Cui Qingde from 15 Districts in the Suburbs of Beijing
Reports on Improved Life After a Good Harvest

[This newspaper] news: Cui Qingde, a representative of labor models from 15 districts in the suburbs of Beijing, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting that under the leadership of the People's Government, the people in the suburbs had a good year for production and their lives had significantly improved. The original letter is as follows: Dear Chairman Mao:

The anniversary of the National Day is approaching, and all the folks in our village are looking forward to going to the city that day to see you and to see the achievements of our Chinese construction over the past year.

Although the People's Government has only been established for a year, it has done a lot of good things for us in this year. Not to mention the distant past, but just taking our Tian Village as an example, the suffering people who used to suffer have now turned themselves over, distributed land, and distributed houses. The People's Government has also provided production loans. After this year's wheat harvest, life has obviously improved. Now it is the autumn harvest again. The year looks good, with peanuts and sweet potatoes both yielding a good harvest. Everyone is happily stepping up the autumn harvest and planting wheat, so as to free up time to go to the city to hold a conference.

I used to be a poor man without land or a house. I worked as a hired hand all my life, and when my son grew up, he also worked as a beast of burden for others. During the land reform, I was given twelve mu of land and three large tile-roofed houses. My father and son returned to work in their own home. We planted crops and engaged in sideline occupations. Our family of three lived happily, without worrying about food and clothing, and even planned for next year's production. Recently, I also bought a donkey, and after the peanuts are unearthed, I can buy a cart. I lived a life of mediocrity, and I never dreamed that I would have such a smooth life today.

What is especially glorious is that in August this year, I was actually elected by the villagers as a representative of labor models in the entire district, and I was respected by the people in the entire district and the city. This kind of glory can only be enjoyed by us working farmers under your leadership and under the People's Government's method of rewarding labor!

Now that the birthday of the People's Government is approaching, how can the people not be happy when they recall the situation before and after this year? We are determined to do a good job in our Chinese family business wholeheartedly under your leadership, and everyone can live a good life peacefully under the protection of the People's Government. If anyone dares to come and destroy us or bully us, we must beat him black and blue and send him rolling into the sea! Chairman Mao! This is a gift from us to you in celebration of National Day. Sincerely!

Cui Qingde, Labor Model Representative of the 15th District in the Suburbs of Beijing

### 京郊十五区劳模崔清德  报告丰收后生活改善

　　京郊十五区劳模崔清德
    报告丰收后生活改善
    【本报讯】京郊十五区劳模代表崔清德给毛主席写信，报告郊区人民在人民政府领导下，今年生产搞得好，生活明显地改善了。原信如下：亲爱的毛主席：
    国庆周年纪念快到了，咱们全村的老百姓都在盼望着这一天进城，好瞧瞧您，瞧瞧这一年来咱们中国建设的成绩。
    人民政府虽然成立才是一年，在这一年里可给咱们办了不少好事，远的不用提，单就我们田村来讲，从前受苦的老百姓现在都翻了身，分了地，分了房。人民政府还放了生产贷款，经过今年的麦收，生活都明显地改善了。现在又是大秋，年景不错，花生、白薯都是丰收，大伙儿都高高兴兴在加紧秋收种麦，好腾出工夫来进城开大会。
    我过去是个没地没房的受苦人，扛了一辈子长活，儿子大了也给人家当牛马。土改时，分了十二亩地，三间大瓦房，爹儿俩回在自己家里干活，种了庄稼又搞副业，一家三口过得挺欢腾，吃穿不用发愁，连明年的生产都打算了。新近我还买了头毛驴，花生出土后就可以买个车。我窝窝囊囊过了一辈子，真是连做梦也没想到会有今天这种顺当日子。
    尤其光荣的是今年八月里，我竟被老乡们评选为全区的劳模代表，受着全区及市里人的尊敬，这种光荣只有在您的领导下，在人民政府奖励劳动的办法下，才会有咱们劳苦农民的份儿啊！
    现在，人民政府的生日快到了，老百姓们回想起这一年前后的光景，谁还能不高兴呢？我们决心在您的领导下，一心一意把咱们中国这份家业搞好，大伙儿和和平平在人民政府的保护下过好光景。谁要是胆敢来破坏咱们，欺侮咱们，咱们一定要把他打个头青眼肿，滚下海去！毛主席！这就是咱们庆祝国庆时献给你的一份礼物。敬礼！
            京郊第十五区劳模代表崔清德
                九月二十二日
