　　Struggle for Peace, Against Instigators of New Wars
    Third Congress of the International Organization of Journalists Opens
    Hronek Calls on All Upright Journalists to Actively Participate in the Peace Movement
    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] A compilation of TASS Helsinki dispatches: The Third Congress of the International Organization of Journalists opened on the 15th in the Finnish capital. Representatives from twenty-six countries are participating in the congress, including the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania, Republican Spain, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, France, Great Britain, the United States, Finland, Italy, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, Iran, and others.

    Finnish Prime Minister Kekkonen, Minister of Education Hiras, diplomatic representatives from various People's Democratic countries, as well as numerous representatives from Finnish democratic organizations and the press, attended the opening ceremony of the congress.

    After the Secretary-General of the International Organization of Journalists, Hronek (Czechoslovakian nationality), delivered the opening address, representatives from the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the General Federation of Finnish Journalists delivered congratulatory speeches to the congress.

    Based on the proposal of the Soviet representative Zaslavsky, the congress unanimously adopted the following agenda:

    1. Report of the Secretary-General of the International Organization of Journalists.
    2. Discussion of the struggle of journalists for peace and against the instigators of new wars.
    3. Discussion of the material and legal status of journalists.
    4. Discussion of organizational issues of the association and election of the leadership of the International Organization of Journalists.

    In his report, Hronek emphasized that the three years since the Second Congress of the International Organization of Journalists in Prague have been marked by a continuous struggle waged by democratic journalists against the instigators of new wars and their lackeys who attempted to split the International Organization of Journalists. However, the reactionary splitters' attempts to eliminate or weaken the International Organization of Journalists have failed. In the struggle, our organization has gradually grown stronger. Our congress is convened at a crucial moment that determines the fate of mankind. Imperialists have launched a war of aggression in Korea and are stepping up preparations for war, attempting to incite a new world war. Journalists play an important role in the struggle for peace. All upright journalists should actively participate in the peace movement and seize the sparks that ignite the flames of war from the hands of the warmongers.

    Representatives from France and the People's Republic of China spoke successively at the meeting, expressing their support for Hronek's report.

    Based on the proposal of the French representative, the congress unanimously agreed to accept the Vietnam Democratic Journalists Association into the International Organization of Journalists. All the representatives stood up and cheered unanimously to the representatives of the Vietnamese people who are engaged in a heroic struggle against the imperialist aggressors.

    At the afternoon session on the 15th, Soviet representative Zaslavsky spoke. He said: The people need fair and truthful news, and in this regard, and only in this regard, is there true freedom of the press. When reactionary Anglo-American journalists held the leadership of the International Organization of Journalists, they wanted to use the International Organization of Journalists to serve the interests of the reactionaries. But they failed. Leadership has legally transferred into the hands of the democrats. The Secretary-General and the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists have not only defended freedom of the the press, but also opposed the persecution of progressive journalists and opposed the warmongers. Zaslavsky asked: What have the Anglo-American reactionary journalists failed to understand to this day? They do not understand that the world has changed and that the era of capitalist monopolization of news has ended. In the Soviet Union, capitalist news has been eliminated for more than thirty years. After the Soviet Union, many countries have emerged where news belongs only to the people and serves the cause of peace and international friendship. Zaslavsky continued: We will continue our work, the work of upright journalists. This work is to expose the warmongers, defend truth, freedom, and the independence of all peoples, and strive for peace.

    African representative Burke then recounted the colonial authorities' brutal suppression of various democratic organizations and journalists' organizations in Africa.

    The delegates to the congress listened with excitement to the speech of Tran Lan (transliteration), the representative of the Vietnamese Democratic Journalists. He emphasized the important role played by the Vietnamese democratic newspapers in the Vietnamese people's struggle for freedom and independence, and on behalf of the Vietnamese journalists, expressed satisfaction with the Congress passing the Vietnam Journalists Association to join the International Organization of Journalists.

    The Congress warmly welcomed the heroic Korean People's Delegation and the Mongolian People's Republic Delegation, who came to participate in the work of the Congress. American representative Wheeler, in the name of the progressive American journalists, extended congratulations to the Korean delegation and expressed his conviction that the Korean people will ultimately prevail.

    The representatives from Poland, Britain, France, Nigeria, and Finland who spoke at the Congress unanimously agreed with the past work of the International Organization of Journalists, agreeing with its struggle for democracy and peace, against the warmongers, and for the liberation of colonial and semi-colonial peoples from imperialist enslavement.

    The Congress received a congratulatory telegram from Japanese progressive journalists, seven hundred of whom have been dismissed for engaging in the struggle for peace.

　　为争取和平、反对新战争挑拨者而斗争
    国际记者协会三届代表大会开幕
    赫朗尼克号召一切正直的记者积极参加和平运动
    【新华社十七日讯】综合塔斯社赫尔辛基消息：国际新闻记者协会第三届代表大会于十五日在芬兰首都开幕。大会有二十六国的代表参加，包括苏联、中华人民共和国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、共和西班牙、越南民主共和国、法国、英国、美国、芬兰、意大利、比利时、挪威、瑞典、荷兰、伊朗等国。
    芬兰总理吉科宁、教育部长希拉斯、各人民民主国的外交代表和芬兰民主人士及报界的许多代表，都参加了大会的开幕式。
    国际新闻记者协会秘书长赫朗尼克（捷克斯洛伐克籍）致开幕辞后，世界工联、世界民主青联和芬兰记者联合会总会的代表们相继向大会致贺词。
    大会根据苏联代表萨斯拉夫斯基的提议，一致通过议程如下：
    一、国际新闻记者协会秘书长报告。
    二、讨论新闻工作者争取和平、反对新战争挑拨者的斗争。
    三、讨论新闻工作者的物质地位与法律地位。
    四、讨论协会组织问题及选举国际新闻记者协会的领导机构。
    赫朗尼克在报告中着重指出：国际新闻记者协会在布拉格举行第二届代表大会以来的三年，是以民主的新闻记者反对新战争挑拨者及其企图分裂国际新闻记者协会的走狗们所进行的不断的斗争为标志的。但是反动的分裂分子企图消灭或削弱国际新闻记者协会的一切计划是失败了。在斗争中，我们的组织已逐渐成长壮大起来。我们的代表大会是在决定人类命运紧要关头召集的。帝国主义者已在朝鲜发动了侵略战争，并且加紧备战，企图煽起新的世界战争。新闻工作者在争取和平的斗争中起着重要的作用。一切正直的新闻记者，都应当积极参加和平运动，从战争贩子手中夺下点燃战争烈焰的火种来。
    法国代表和中华人民共和国代表在会上相继发言，表示拥护赫朗尼克的报告。
    大会根据法国代表的提案，一致通过接受越南民主共和国新闻记者协会加入国际新闻记者协会。全体代表起立，一致向与帝国主义侵略者进行英勇斗争的越南人民代表欢呼。
    在十五日下午会议上，苏联代表萨斯拉夫斯基发言。他说：人民需要有公正而真实的新闻，在这一点上，并且只有在这一点上，才有真正的新闻自由。反动的英美新闻记者在掌握着国际新闻记者协会的领导权的时候，曾想利用国际新闻记者协会为反动派的利益服务。但是他们失败了。领导权以合法的根据转入了民主派的手中。国际新闻记者协会秘书长与执行委员会不仅保卫了新闻自由，并且反对迫害进步的新闻记者，反对战争贩子。萨斯拉夫斯基问道：英美反动的新闻记者至今未能了解的是什么呢？他们不了解世界已经变了，资本主义垄断新闻的时代已经终结了。在苏联，资本主义新闻已消灭了三十多年。在苏联之后，出现了许多国家，那里新闻仅属于人民，并为和平与国际友好的事业而服务。萨斯拉夫斯基继称：我们将继续我们的工作，正直的新闻记者的工作。这一工作便是揭露战争贩子，保卫真理、自由和各族人民的独立，并争取和平。
    非洲代表柏克继起叙述了帝国主义者殖民地当局残酷镇压非洲各民主组织与新闻记者组织的情形。
    大会代表兴奋地听取了越南民主新闻记者代表陈兰（译音）的演讲。他强调越南民主报纸在越南人民争取自由与独立的斗争中所发挥的重要作用，并代表越南新闻记者，对大会通过越南新闻记者协会参加国际新闻记者协会表示满意。
    大会热烈欢迎了前来参加大会工作的英勇的朝鲜人民代表团与蒙古人民共和国代表团。美国代表惠勒以进步的美国新闻记者的名义，向朝鲜代表团致祝贺，并表示确信朝鲜人民终必获胜。
    在大会上发言的波兰、英国、法国、尼日利亚与芬兰的代表，一致同意国际新闻记者协会过去的工作，同意它为争取民主与和平，为反对战争贩子，为从帝国主义奴役下解放殖民地与半殖民地人民而进行的斗争。
    大会接到了日本进步新闻记者的贺电，他们当中有七百人因从事争取和平的斗争已被解雇。
