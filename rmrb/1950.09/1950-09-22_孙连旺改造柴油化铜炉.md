　　Sun Lianwang Transforms Diesel Copper Furnace
　　Our Reporter Yao Fu
　　Sun Lianwang is a melter in the foundry of the Tangshan Railway Factory. In April of this year, he successfully transformed the diesel copper furnace, which improved the efficiency of copper melting. The time for melting a furnace of copper was shortened from three and a half hours to one hour; the amount of copper melted per kilogram of diesel was increased from seven kilograms to twelve kilograms; and the amount of copper melted by three workers was increased from 1,200 kilograms to 2,400 kilograms by two workers. The annual savings amounted to over 224.5 million yuan, creating a large amount of wealth for the country. He was elected by the directly subordinate trade union of the China Railway Union as a representative to the National Congress of Labor Heroes of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers.
　　Sun Lianwang has been working for twenty-nine years, and has been at the Tangshan Machine Factory for twenty years. Over the years, he has accumulated rich experience in watching the furnace. After liberation, in order to quickly restore the people's railways, there was a lot of work, and the copper melted could not keep up with the demand. Every worker was very anxious. Sun Lianwang was determined to transform the copper melting furnace in order to increase the efficiency of copper melting. Whenever he had the opportunity, he conducted experiments according to his own methods, slightly thickening the bottom of the copper melting furnace and reducing the amount of copper blocks placed in it. Sure enough, the number of furnace openings per day increased from one or two to three times, and the copper liquid was clearer than before. However, the workshop director only reported to the higher authorities that "less copper was put in." In fact, he had already made preliminary modifications to the bottom of the furnace.
　　In March of this year, the vigorous New Record Movement and Rationalization Proposal Movement were in full swing at the railway factory. The machinery workshop proposed to enter into a contact contract with the foundry workshop, the central condition being that the number of castings with sand holes should not exceed nine percent. The foundry workshop's various sand molding groups repeatedly studied methods to improve quality. The workers in the copper room group all said, "Copper liquid that is not clear is prone to sand holes." Some also said, "The copper melting cannot keep up with the sand molding work, the efficiency is slow, and there are sand molds left over every day." Sun Lianwang felt uneasy. He thought, "What should be done? The responsibility lies with me alone." After a moment of silence, he suddenly proposed to everyone, "If we want clear copper liquid and fast copper melting, we must thoroughly transform the furnace body." The news quickly spread to the higher authorities. Comrades from the trade union immediately mobilized him to submit a rationalization proposal to the administration. In the afternoon, Factory Director Wei and Factory Party Secretary Song Chuntao came to talk to him in person. Sun Lianwang said with full confidence, "I dare to take responsibility." The proposal was quickly approved, and it was decided to complete the repairs on Saturday and Sunday, with a maximum delay of only one day of production.
　　On the day of the furnace repair, Sun Lianwang ate breakfast and went to the foundry as soon as it was light. When building the furnace, he carefully observed, measured, and arranged, his body and face covered with black and yellow mud and oil. He pressed the refractory bricks tightly against the iron wall. According to the original plan, he thickened the furnace bottom by three and a half inches; enlarged the fire eye to four inches, and changed it to "eccentric" to make the casting of copper liquid more convenient. What if there were no suitable curved bricks? He crushed refractory bricks and used red mud instead. The furnace modification plan was completed as scheduled.
　　The furnace modification work was at the final stage of testing, and Sun Lianwang was particularly nervous. The workers who were eagerly anticipating success all gathered around to watch. Sun Lianwang carefully opened the fire nozzle, and the furnace mouth immediately roared. Then he adjusted the wind force, increased or decreased the amount of oil, and used an iron rod to probe the temperature of the copper liquid, operating skillfully and nervously. The first furnace usually took three and a half hours, but this time it only took less than one and a half hours to reach the required temperature. After carefully probing again, Sun Lianwang said to everyone, "Cast!" People busied about, the white copper liquid gushing out, the firelight illuminating everyone's faces. The foundry workers carefully cast it into the sand molds, and countless sparks of copper liquid splashed out. Then the second furnace roared again, and the melting time was shortened to one hour. On this day alone, six furnaces were opened continuously, and the output increased. Also, because the copper liquid was clear, the castings achieved unexpected success. Sun Lianwang was victorious.

　　孙连旺改造柴油化铜炉
    本报记者  药夫
    孙连旺是唐山铁路工厂铸工场熔化工。今年四月，他改造柴油化铜炉成功，提高了化铜效率。化一炉铜由三点半钟缩短到一个钟头；由一公斤柴油化七公斤铜提高到一公斤柴油化十二斤铜；由三个工人熔化铜一千二百公斤，提高到两个人化铜二千四百公斤。全年节省二亿二千四百五十余万元，为国家创造了大量财富。此次被中国铁路工会直属工会选举为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。
    孙连旺已经做了二十九年工，在唐山机厂就有二十年的工龄。在多年的工作中，积累了丰富的看炉经验。解放后，为了尽速恢复人民的铁路，活特别多，化的铜赶不上用，每一个工友都非常着急。孙连旺就决心改造化铜炉，以增加化铜效率。有机会他就根据自己的办法进行试验，将化铜炉底加厚了一点，铜块少放了一些，果然，每天开炉由一、二次提高到三次了，铜水也较前清，可是场主任只是向上级报告“放的铜少些”。其实他已将炉底作了初步改造。
    今年三月轰轰烈烈的新纪录运动和合理化建议运动在铁路工厂沸腾了起来。机械场向铸工场提出订立联系合同，中心条件就是铸件中带砂眼的活不超过百分之九。铸工场各翻砂组反复研究提高质量的方法，铜房组工友都说：“铜水不清就爱出砂眼。”有的又说：“化铜水赶不上翻砂活，效率慢，每天要剩下砂型。”孙连旺感到不安，他想：“这怎么办呢？责任在我一人身上。”沉默了一会，他突然向大家提议：“要想铜水清，化铜快，非彻底改造炉身不可。”消息很快传到上级，工会同志马上动员他向行政上提合理化建议，下午魏厂长和工厂党委书记宋春涛同志又亲自来谈话，孙连旺满怀信心的说：“我敢负责任。”建议很快被批准了，并且决定利用星期六和星期日两天修好，最多只能误一天生产。
    修炉这天，孙连旺天刚亮就吃了饭到铸工场。在砌炉时，他细心的观测、丈量、安排，身上、脸上粘满了黑色黄色的泥和油，他把一块块耐火砖紧贴在铁壁上。照原来的计划将炉底加厚三寸半；过火眼放大到四英寸，又改成了“偏心”，使铸铜水更加方便；没有合适的弯砖怎么办呢？便打碎耐火砖和上红泥来代替。改炉的计划如期完成了。
    改炉工作已到最后考验的关头，孙连旺特别紧张。热盼成功的工友们都围在一旁看。孙连旺小心打开火嘴，炉口立即吼叫起来，接着他调节风力，增减油量，用铁棍探试铜水温度，熟练而紧张地操作着。第一炉通常要三小时半，这次不到一小时半就够温度了。孙连旺又细心的探试后，向大家说：“铸吧！”人们一阵忙乱，白色的铜水滚滚流出，火光映红了每个人的脸，铸工小心的铸在砂模里，铜水溅出无数的火花；接着第二炉又在吼叫了，溶化时间缩短到一小时。仅在这一天便连续出炉六次，产量提高了，又因为铜水清，铸件得到意外的成功，孙连旺胜利了。
