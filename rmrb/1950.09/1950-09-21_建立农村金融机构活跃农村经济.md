Establishing Rural Financial Institutions to Activate the Rural Economy
　　Shen Jiyan, Secretary of the General Manager's Office, Northeast Bank

Since the Northeast Bank put forward a new business policy in January of this year, strengthened cash management, and implemented a new credit settlement system, bank deposits have increased more than twofold and loans have increased threefold in the past six months. This has strongly supported the turnover of temporary urgent funds for industrial production, particularly guaranteeing trade acquisitions, supporting the export of materials, and ensuring the effective coordination of industrial raw materials with the overall national economic construction plan. Banking institutions have also expanded. Banking organizations have been established successively in various cities and larger industrial areas, and have penetrated into factories and mines, replacing the receipt, disbursement, and allocation of all funds in factories and mines, paying wages, developing savings business, and carrying out cash management. This has enabled the bank to establish a receipt and payment settlement network and a cash payment network within the scope of state-owned enterprises and local enterprises, initially becoming a cash center, a credit center, and a settlement center. Therefore, it has been able to conditionally grasp cash payments and actively and proactively control credit, and appropriately adjust the amount of cash in circulation, playing a certain role in stabilizing finance and developing production.

The experience of implementing new businesses in the past six months is: to further exert the role of the bank in a new democratic country, the bank must be able to play a role in closely combining and mutually adjusting the entire national economy (i.e., the five economies of new democracy). Therefore, the bank's business should not only focus on industry, but also appropriately take care of rural areas and combine with agriculture. Only in this way can industry and agriculture, cities and villages, be more closely integrated. This is primarily because agriculture still accounts for a large proportion of our entire national economy. Rural areas not only produce a large amount of grain, but also produce a large amount of sideline products and important export materials. The continued development and appropriate promotion of these products are closely related to guaranteeing industrial raw materials and increasing farmers' purchasing power.

Secondly, it is also very important to plan and adjust the currency circulation between urban and rural areas to facilitate urban-rural exchanges. From the experience in the first half of the year, we felt that the problems were the sluggish turnover of commodities and the insufficient amount of currency circulation in rural areas. According to a survey in Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, farmers had an average of only 2,000 yuan (Northeast currency, the same below) to 6,000 yuan per person; a survey in the suburbs of Shenyang showed that each person had an average of only 2,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan. Moreover, due to the lack of currency in rural areas, serious barter phenomena occurred, which affected agricultural and sideline production.

In order to better support agriculture and sideline production, develop rural credit, solve farmers' temporary urgent difficulties, and improve agricultural loan work, it has become necessary.

In order to achieve this goal, the Northeast Bank has proposed in its work for the second half of the year to steadily establish a bank network from cities to villages and from factories to mines, and has decided to establish bank institutions and set up bank business offices in key rural towns and economic centers, in order to further deepen and develop banking business.

The establishment of business offices by banks in key rural towns first allows the bank to have eyes and ears in rural areas, so that the bank can understand the economic situation and currency circulation in rural areas at any time, in order to actively, promptly, and appropriately adjust the amount of currency circulation in rural areas. Through the organization of bank business offices, cities can be further integrated with rural areas. At the same time, it can further develop banking business and exert the role of banks in rural areas.

1.  It can further strengthen and improve rural loan work: Although agricultural loan work has achieved great results in the past, the banking institutions are located in cities and can only enter the countryside and return to the city with seasonal changes. For example, before the spring plowing, agricultural loan officers go to the countryside collectively to issue spring plowing loans, and after the autumn harvest, they go to the countryside to collect spring loans and issue them. After the issuance or collection is completed, they return to the city. Although there is also inspection work after the agricultural loan is issued and before it is recovered, it is ultimately limited by time and cannot and cannot comprehensively and deeply understand the farmers' requirements and the specific situation of agricultural loans. Therefore, in our agricultural loan work, even though we have planned carefully and repeatedly, it is still inevitable that problems will occur. For example, in this year's preparation for agricultural loans, we prepared what the masses did not need, and we did not prepare what the masses needed. In some places, the masses needed less, and we prepared more; in some places, the masses needed more, but we lent less. In the selection of loan recipients, there are also phenomena such as those who should have been loaned were not loaned, and those who should not have been loaned or should have been loaned less were loaned or loaned more. Secondly, there are also many difficulties in the inconvenience of agricultural loan officers traveling to and from the countryside, as well as the lax political life after going to the countryside. If the bank establishes a business office in the countryside and uses the original agricultural loan officers as the backbone of the business office, the bank can regularly understand the farmers' production situation, understand the farmers' urgent needs, and check the use of agricultural loans at any time, in order to appropriately and promptly solve the difficulties in farmers' production, avoid or reduce the past blind phenomena in agricultural loan work, and make the bank's agricultural loans play a greater role.

2.  Develop rural credit business, handle short-term credit loans, solve farmers' urgent needs, and reduce the exploitation of usury. In rural areas, since the land reform, due to uneven development, the borrowing relationship in rural areas has developed. At present, we welcome this kind of lending relationship; however, in lending, the phenomenon of usury is very serious. According to Heilongjiang's reflection: the interest on private loans in rural areas is as high as 20%, which shows that after the difficulty of solving production is resolved, many temporary urgent difficulties still need to be solved by relying on short-term credit. The second task of rural business offices is to handle short-term credit, help farmers engage in sideline and household handicraft production, and solve farmers' temporary urgent difficulties such as marriage, funeral, marriage, birth, old age, sickness, and death, in order to reduce the exploitation of farmers by usury.

3.  Develop rural savings business, absorb various deposits, and exert the due role of scattered rural funds; especially develop rural livestock insurance business. If the livestock insurance work can be carried out well, it will be of great significance to farmers' exemption from accidental losses and protection of agricultural production. Because livestock insurance enables farmers to pay a small amount of insurance premiums at ordinary times, and when livestock suffer from epidemics or die, the insurance company can help farmers buy back the same livestock according to the insurance rules, so that production will not be completely suspended due to temporary accidental losses. At the same time, it also plays a great role in strengthening livestock epidemic prevention, reducing the loss of national wealth, and ensuring that the entire production is not affected.

4.  In addition to the above businesses, it can also handle agency collection and payment and other work. Establishing bank business offices in villages is the direction of efforts in future work, but at present we have limited experience and limited conditions such as cadres, so it should be a typical trial run rather than a universal development. Local banks should consult with the Party and government, and combine with the local government's economic construction plan, first select the towns and towns with more important transportation and economic conditions for establishment, so as to obtain experience before gradually deepening and developing.

　　建立农村金融机构活跃农村经济
    东北银行总行经理室秘书  申纪言
    东北银行自本年一月开始提出新的业务方针，加强了现金管理，实行了新的信贷结算制度后，半年来银行存款增加了两倍多，放款增加了三倍，大力支持了工业生产临时急需资金的周转，特别是保证了贸易收购，支持了对外物资的出口，保证了工业原料有力的配合整个国家经济建设计划的完成。银行机构亦有扩大，在各城市及较大的工业地区均先后建立了银行组织，并已深入到工厂和矿山内，代替厂矿中一切资金的收支调拨、支发工资，开展了储蓄业务，进行了现金管理等工作，使银行在国营企业地方企业的范围内建立了收支结算网与现金支付网，初步成为现金中心、信贷中心与结算中心。因此，得能有条件的来掌握现金的支付和积极主动的掌握信贷，并适当的调剂现金流通量，对稳定金融、发展生产起了一定的作用。
    半年来执行新业务的体会是：要进一步发挥新民主主义国家银行的作用，必须使银行能在整个国民经济（即新民主主义的五种经济）中，起到密切结合与互相调剂的作用，因此，银行的业务就不仅要着重于工业，并应适当的照顾农村结合农业。这样才能使工业与农业，城市与乡村更密切的结合起来。这首先因为目前在我们的整个国民经济中，农业还占很大的比重，农村中不仅生产着大量的粮食，而且也生产着大量的副业产品和重要的出口物资，这些生产品继续的发展与适当的推销，对保证工业原料与提高农民购买力有着密切的关系。
    其次，有计划的调剂城乡的货币流通，以利城乡交流也是非常重要的。从上半年的经验中，我们曾感到的问题是商品周转不灵与农村货币流通量的不足，如松江双城县调查，农民平均每人只有二千元（东北币，下同）至六千元；沈阳市郊调查，每人平均仅有二千元至四千元，并且由于农村中货币的缺乏，曾严重的发生以物易物的现象，使农业和副业生产受到影响。
    为更好的扶助农业、副业生产，开展农村信用，解决农民临时急需困难，提高农业贷款工作已成为必要。
    东北银行为达到此目的，下半年工作中提出由城市到乡村，从工厂到矿山，稳步地建立银行网，决定在农村重镇及经济中心地区建立银行机构，设立银行营业所，以求银行业务进一步的深入与发展。
    银行在农村集镇重点建立营业所，首先使银行在农村中开始有了耳目，使银行能随时了解农村的经济状况，货币流通情况，以便主动及时而适当地调剂农村的货币流通量，通过银行营业所的组织，使城市进一步地与乡村结合。同时亦可以进一步开展银行业务，发挥银行在农村的作用。
    一、可以进一步加强与提高农村贷款工作：过去农贷工作虽已收到很大的成绩，但是由于银行机构在城市，仅能随着季节性的变化，而进入乡村回到城市。如春耕前农贷员即集体下乡发放春耕贷款，秋收后又下乡催收春贷，发放或催收完毕便又回到城市。虽然在农贷发放后与收回以前也有检查工作，但终因时间所限，不能够亦不可能全面、深刻地来体会农民要求与了解农贷的具体情况。因此，我们在农贷工作中，虽曾再三周密计划，终难免有问题发生。如今年农贷备实中，群众不需要的我们准备了，而群众需要的，我们却没有准备。有的地方群众需要的少，我们准备的多；有的地方群众需要的多而我们却贷放的少。在发放对象的选择上亦有应贷的未贷给，不应贷或应少贷的却贷给或多贷了等现象。其次，在农贷员下乡往返不便，以及下乡后政治生活的散漫，因而亦有很多困难。如银行在农村设立营业所，以原有的农贷员为营业所的骨干，则银行便可以经常了解农民生产情况，了解农民的迫切需要，随时的检查农贷用途，以便适当及时解决农民生产中的困难，避免或减少以往农贷工作中的盲目现象，使银行的农贷发挥更大的作用。
    二、开展农村信用业务，办理短期信用贷款，解决农民急需，以减少高利贷的剥削。农村中，自土地改革后，由于发展的不平衡，农村的借款关系已有了发展。在目前，这种借贷关系我们是欢迎的；但在借贷中，高利贷的现象非常严重。据黑龙江反映：农村中私人借款利息有高到二十分的，这说明农民在生产困难解决以后，临时急需的困难需要依靠短期信贷来解决的还是很多。农村营业所的第二项任务便是办理短期信贷，扶助农民从事副业与家庭手工业生产及解决农民婚、丧、嫁、娶、生、老、病、死等临时急需的困难，以减少农民所受的高利贷剥削。
    三、开展农村储蓄业务，吸收各种存款，发挥农村零散资金应有的作用；特别是开展农村牲畜保险业务。如牲畜保险工作能很好的开展，则对农民免受意外的损失与保障农业生产的关系很大。因牲畜保险事业使农民平时出少许的保险费，而在牲畜一旦发生疫病或死亡时，可以由保险公司按保险的规则帮助农民再买回同样的牲畜，不致因一时的意外损失，使生产完全陷于停顿。同时在加强牲畜防疫、减少国民财富的损失与保证整个生产不受影响，亦有很大作用。
    四、除以上业务外，并可办理代理收付款项等工作。建立譬村中的银行营业所是今后工作的努力方向，但目前我们经验不多，干部等条件亦有限制，应是典型试办而不是普遍的开展。各地银行，应与党政协商，结合当地政府的经济建设计划，首先选择交通与经济条件比较重要的集镇，进行建立，以便取得经验后，再逐步深入开展。
