　　Unrealistic Planning and Lack of Inspection and Supervision
    Many Power Construction Plans in Guannei Remain Unfinished

    [Our Newspaper News] Special correspondent Qi Ming reports: Most of the basic power construction plans in Guannei have not been completed in the first half of the year, and the organizational leadership of construction work needs to be strengthened urgently. In the first half of the year, there were a total of thirty-two basic power construction projects in Guannei, of which twenty have started. As of now, many bureaus and factories have failed to complete their planned goals in terms of project progress, material supply, and preparatory work. According to incomplete materials, by the end of May, only 27.7% of the annual plan had been completed; however, 84% of the annual investment had already been pre-allocated, resulting in serious capital backlog and waste. Furthermore, there are many problems with the plans themselves. Among all eleven relocation projects, seven have been changed due to improper planning; there are also seven cases of temporary additional investment and added engineering. Regarding the progress of the projects, only two of the total of fifteen new construction projects have been completed over 80%, and five have not yet started. The formation of this phenomenon is mainly due to:

    1. Insufficient understanding of various aspects when formulating plans, coupled with a lack of investigation and research, resulting in plans that are not thorough or complete: only project items are listed, without labor, salary, material supply, finance, and specific construction plans. This has led to chaotic phenomena in project implementation, capital utilization, materials, technology, and supply, affecting project progress.

    2. Design work is not thorough, and there is a lack of strict engineering technical standards, resulting in non-compliance with technical regulations.

    3. Decision-making regarding engineering plans lacks long-term considerations.

    4. Material supply is not timely, and there is a lack of inspection. Reserve materials are out of sync with project progress, the quality of materials is poor, and they cannot be used when delivered to the construction site. Sometimes, work even stops to wait for materials. Some materials and equipment that were originally designed are found to be unsuitable during construction, which also causes undue delays in project progress.

    5. The allocation of funds is not tightly controlled, the financial system is unsound, discipline is lax, funds are used chaotically, and even business expenses are diverted to administrative recurring expenses.

    6. Supervision at the construction site is not strict, resulting in poor project quality and waste of resources. For example, at the Hangu substation, the supervisors colluded with contractors to accept bribes, and on-site supervision was irresponsible, resulting in very poor quality of the houses built and a lot of waste of resources.

    7. Leading organs do not have a deep understanding of the engineering plans. Apart from reports on the implementation of the plans from some units, many units, after receiving the funds, never report the construction situation to the leading organs. The leading organs also do not send special personnel to conduct in-depth on-site inspections and supervision, and after the funds are allocated, they believe that the matter is completed, resulting in a disconnection between higher and lower levels.

    Based on the above situation, the following issues must be paid attention to in the future of Guannei's basic power construction tasks:

    1. The leadership must attach importance to and grasp construction work, strengthen the organization of the basic construction department, equip it with the necessary design and construction technical personnel, and transfer technicians to enrich the organization of various construction teams.

    2. Strengthen investigation and research work and make good basic construction plans. After determining the project items, design review should be carried out step by step. The construction plan must be clear and specific, including the engineering materials, specifications, quantity, required time, and the required quantity and coordination order of each type of work. Without these contents, the plan will lose its guarantee, and the project cannot be inspected.

    3. Establish the economic accounting ideology of basic construction. The engineering design, labor, materials, costs, and time must be carefully calculated. Otherwise, it will inevitably cause huge waste of human and material resources.

    4. Implement a special responsibility system and contract system to reduce waste and ensure quality. For each project, from planning, design, drawing, review, and various types of work to machine installation, the work progress and responsibilities of individuals should be determined.

    5. Strengthen the on-site supervision system, and the inspection and supervision of the use of basic construction funds and the financial system.

### 计划不切实际缺乏检查监督  关内电业建设计划多未完成

　　计划不切实际缺乏检查监督
    关内电业建设计划多未完成
    【本报讯】特约通讯员齐明报道：关内电业基本建设计划，上半年多未完成，急需加强修建工作的组织领导。上半年关内电业基本建设工程共三十二件，已开工者二十件。截至目前为止，无论在工程进度和器材供应及准备工作上，许多局、厂多未完成预定计划。根据不完全材料了解，截至五月底止，仅完成了全年计划的百分之二十七．七；但建设资金已预领了年投资额百分之八十四，形成严重的资金积压和浪费。再就计划本身来看，也存在很多问题。在全部十一件迁建工程中，因计划不当而变更者有七件之多；临时追加投资及增添工程者亦有七件。在工程的进度上，全部十五件新建工程中，只有两件完成百分之八十以上，至今尚未动工者五件。这种现象的形成，主要是由于：
    一、制订计划时对各方面情况还掌握不够，加之缺乏调查研究，致计划不周密、不完备：仅有工程项目而无劳动、工薪、材料供应、财务以及具体的施工计划，因而造成了工程进行、资金运用、材料、技术、供应等方面紊乱现象，影响了工程进度。
    二、设计工作不周密，缺乏严格的工程技术标准，致发生不合技术规程的现象。
    三、决定工程计划缺乏长远打算。
    四、材料供应不及时，缺乏检查。储备材料与工程进程脱节，材料品质不好，运到工地不能用。有时甚至停工待料。有些原来设计的材料及设备，施工时发现不适用，也使工程进度遭到不应有的迟延。
    五、资金调拨掌握不紧，财政制度不健全，纪律松懈，资金使用混乱，甚至将事业费移作行政经常费开支。
    六、施工现场监督不严，造成工程质量低劣，浪费资材现象。例如汉沽变电所监工人员与包商勾结受贿，现场监工不负责任，修建的房屋质量很坏，资财浪费很多。
    七、领导机关对工程计划深入了解不够。除了某些单位有执行计划的报告外，不少单位将资金领去后，从不把修建情况报告领导机关。领导机关也未派专人深入现场检查监督，资金调拨后，便认为完事大吉，造成上下脱节现象。
    根据上述情况，关内区电业基本建设任务今后必须注意以下几个问题：
    一、领导上必须重视与抓紧修建工作，加强基本建设处的组织，配备必需的设计、施工的技术人员，调集技工，充实各工程队的组织。
    二、加强调查研究工作，作好基本建设计划。确定了工程项目后，就要逐步的进行设计审核。订施工计划必须明确具体，工程材料、规格、数量、需要时间、以及各工种需要数量、配合顺序等均须一一列入。没有这些内容，计划就会失去保证，工程亦无从检查。
    三、树立基本建设的经济核算思想。对工程设计、人工、材料、费用、时间必须精密计算。否则必致造成人力材料的巨大浪费。
    四、实施专责制度及合同制，减少浪费，保证质量。每件工程从计划、设计、绘图、审核以及各工种直到机器按装，均应确定个人的工作进度和应负责任。
    五、加强现场监工制度，及对基本建设资金的使用及财务制度的检查监督。
