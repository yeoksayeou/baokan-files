(Beijing News Agency) President Wang Feiran of the Beijing Municipal People's Court issued a statement on the establishment of district people's courts regarding the establishment of the Beijing First District People's Court on August 29th and the upcoming establishment of the Second and Third District People's Courts. President Wang Feiran of the Beijing Municipal People's Court gave a speech on the process of establishing district people's courts in Beijing, the nature, tasks, working principles of the district people's courts, and their important significance in the people's judicial work in large cities:

　　The district people's courts were established in accordance with the spirit of Article 17 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which calls for "establishing a people's judicial system." In February of this year, the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference passed a resolution on the establishment of district people's courts. President Shen Junru of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government emphasized the importance of primary trial organs in his speech at that meeting and explained the significance of the pilot establishment of district people's courts in Beijing and Tianjin based on this principle. On March 8th, the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice jointly issued a notice to the Beijing Municipal People's Government instructing the Municipal People's Court to begin preparations for the establishment of district people's courts.

　　This new people's judicial organization and system is the first of its kind in the country. Therefore, the Municipal People's Court, under the leadership of the Supreme People's Court, the Ministry of Justice, and the direct leadership and assistance of the Municipal People's Government, cautiously conducted a relatively long period of preparation. When the Municipal Court began clearing backlog cases in late May, it prepared to lay a favorable foundation for the district people's courts during this work process. Therefore, the clearance of backlog cases adopted the method of using districts as trial units. That is, the Municipal Court dispatched a large number of cadres to form trial groups with the district offices to try cases filed by parties in the district in the Municipal Court that had not been resolved in a timely manner. This method was welcomed by the people in various districts, proving that establishing trial institutions in each district can resolve civil disputes more promptly, and also proving that the establishment of district people's courts is very necessary.

　　Based on the principle of Article 2 of the "Trial Measures for District People's Courts in Beijing and Tianjin" jointly issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Ministry of Justice, the Municipal Government decided to first set up three district people's courts by merging the nine administrative districts in the city; at the same time, according to the spirit of Article 1, "to promptly resolve civil disputes," it was decided that each district people's court should set up one or more trial groups to be stationed in each district on a regular basis, so that the people of each district can conduct litigation locally within their district.

　　One of the important characteristics and advantages of the people's judicial system is "convenience for the people." The establishment of district people's courts is precisely to achieve this goal, and it will certainly be able to achieve this goal. We can imagine that in a large city like Beijing with a population of two million, all cases are concentrated in one Municipal People's Court, which is not only overly burdensome, but also often cannot be handled in a timely manner, and is prone to backlog and delay. After the establishment of district people's courts, on the one hand, cases are dispersed in various districts; on the other hand, the court is closer to the litigants, and can conduct summons and investigations at any time. For example, when the Municipal People's Court discovers new witnesses or evidence when hearing a case, it may take until the next day to summon them at the earliest, while the district people's court can very likely handle it on the same day when encountering this situation. The establishment of district people's courts makes it easier for the judicial department to closely contact the masses, widely listen to their opinions, and combine on-site investigations with court investigations; and these are precisely the directions of the people's judicial work and trial work. In addition, because the district people's courts are directly connected to the masses, they can also more deeply and promptly understand the needs of the masses and constantly improve their work based on this need.

　　The focus of the work of the district people's courts is obviously on resolving internal problems of the people, that is, civil disputes. In the past, the number of dispute cases handled by the mediation sections of various districts was very large, and the cases accepted by the Municipal People's Court were also mostly civil disputes. From these two facts, it can be seen that the focus of the work of the district people's courts is on handling civil disputes. The principle of handling should focus on strengthening the unity between the people, and the working method should focus on mediation. Therefore, it is necessary to attach importance to the provision of Article 3 of the "Trial Measures for District People's Courts in Beijing and Tianjin" regarding "strengthening mediation work." As for the criminal cases accepted by the district people's courts, some of them are still internal disputes of the people, such as fights and minor injuries, which can also be reasonably resolved through mediation; for more serious criminal cases, because the district people's courts are directly connected to the masses, they can take a serious and cautious attitude to make prompt judgments. This can play a greater role in reducing and preventing violations and crimes and consolidating the revolutionary order. Only when the district people's courts undertake these tasks can the Municipal People's Court free up its strength to better complete its central task—handling counter-revolutionary cases, cases of sabotaging national economic construction, and other important cases—which is also the first-instance case of the Municipal People's Court as stipulated in Article 4 of the trial measures.

　　In addition, another important feature of the people's judicial work is that it relies on the people's increasing understanding of policies and laws and gradually consciously resolves mutual disputes based on policies and laws; therefore, propaganda and education work is an important task of the people's judicial department. It is hoped that when each district establishes a district people's court, it will first conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda on some issues related to the district people's court itself. In the future, in regular work, through some specific cases, help citizens understand and understand the policies and laws of the People's Government at any time. It is also hoped that the staff of the district people's court will take time to use public places where people gather, such as temple fairs and cultural and educational centers, to systematically explain various policies and laws to the masses, and to post and explain some typical judgments in a planned manner. It is also possible to carefully conduct trial work in appropriate locations with leadership and planning, so that more people have the opportunity to listen in, which can be done with certain conditions.

　　Finally, the district people's court should also establish close ties with relevant departments and people's organizations in the district under the guidance and assistance of the district office. For the trial of some important cases, it is necessary to ask all parties to provide assistance in order to handle the cases better. Trial work should follow the mass line, and doing so is an important mass line.

　　京市人民法院王斐然院长
    就成立区人民法院事发表谈话
    【京市新闻处讯】京市第一区人民法院已于八月二十九日正式成立，第二、第三两个区人民法院不久也将相继成立；京市人民法院王斐然院长特就京市创设区人民法院的经过和区人民法院的性质、任务、工作方针及其在大城市人民司法工作中的重要意义等发表谈话如下：
    区人民法院是遵照人民政协共同纲领第十七条“建立人民司法制度”的精神而创设的。今年二月本市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议通过了关于设立区人民法院的决议；中央人民政府最高人民法院沈钧儒院长在那次会议上的讲话中更着重的阐述了初审机关的重要性，并根据这一原则说明了关于在京、津两市试办区人民法院的意义。三月八日，最高人民法院及司法部正式会衔通知北京市人民政府转令市人民法院着手筹设区人民法院。
    这种新的人民司法组织和制度，在全国范围内还是首创；因此，市人民法院在中央人民政府最高人民法院、司法部等领导机关及市人民政府直接领导与协助下慎重地进行了比较长期的筹备工作。在五月下旬市法院开始清理积案工作时，即准备在这一工作过程中，为区人民法院打下有利的基础。所以清理积案工作，采取了以区为审判单位的办法。就是由市法院派出大量干部与各区公所共同组成审判组，就地审理各该区当事人在市法院起诉而未及时解决的案件。这一办法受到各区人民的欢迎，证明了在各区分设审判机构，能够更及时地解决民间纠纷，也证明区人民法院的建立是十分必要的。
    市府根据最高人民法院与司法部联合颁发的“京、津两市区人民法院试行办法”第二条的原则，决定先在城内九个行政区中合并设置三个区人民法院；同时根据第一条“使民间纠纷及时得到解决”的精神，决定每一个区人民法院分别设立一个或几个审判组，常川分驻各区，使每区人民，都能在本区境内就地进行诉讼。
    人民司法制度的重要特点和优点之一是“便利人民”。而区人民法院的建立正是为了达到这个目的，而且也一定能够达到这个目的。我们可以设想：像北京市这样拥有二百万人口的大城市，所有的案件全部集中在一个市人民法院，不仅过分繁重，而且在处理案件上往往不能及时，容易积压拖延。有了区人民法院之后，一方面案件分散在各区；另一方面，法院与诉讼当事人距离较近，可以随时进行传讯和调查。例如：当市人民法院审理案件时发现新的证人、证物后，最快也要到第二天才可能传讯，而区人民法院遇到这种情况，很可能当天就从事处理。有了区人民法院就使司法部门更容易密切联系群众，广泛听取群众意见，使实地调查与法庭调查相结合；而这些，正是人民司法工作和审判工作的努力方向。此外，由于区人民法院直接联系群众，也就更能深入及时地了解群众的需要，并根据这种需要不断的改进自己的工作。
    区人民法院的工作重点显然地是在解决人民内部的问题，即民事纠纷。过去各区调解科处理的纠纷案件数字是很庞大的，市人民法院受理的案件，也以民事纠纷为最多，从这两项事实可以看出，区人民法院工作的重点是处理民事纠纷。处理的原则应该着重于加强人民之间的团结，而工作方式也就着重在调解。因此必须重视“京、津两市区人民法院试行办法”第三条关于“加强调解工作”的规定。至于区人民法院所受理的刑事案件，一部分也还是人民内部的纠纷，如斗殴、轻微伤害等，也可用调解方式进行合理解决；比较严重的刑事案件，则因区人民法院直接联系群众，更能采取严肃、慎重的态度迅速判决。这对于减少和预防违法、犯罪及巩固革命秩序方面，都能发挥更大的作用。也只有区人民法院担负起这些任务，市人民法院才能抽出力量来更好地完成它的中心任务——处理反革命案、破坏国家经济建设案及其他重要案件，——也就是试行办法第四条中所规定的市人民法院的第一审案件。
    此外，人民司法工作的另一个重要特点是：依靠人民对政策、法令的日益了解而逐渐自觉地根据政策、法令自行解决相互间的纠纷；因此宣传教育工作是人民司法部门的一项重要工作。希望各区在成立区人民法院时首先把有关区人民法院本身的一些问题进行广泛深入的宣传。今后在经常工作中，通过一些具体案件随时帮助市民体会和了解人民政府的政策、法令。还希望区人民法院的工作人员，抽出时间来利用人民聚集的地方如庙会文教馆等公共场所，对群众系统的讲解各项政策法令，并有计划地张贴和讲解一些典型判决，而有领导有计划地选择适当的地点，进行审判工作，使更多的人民得到旁听的机会，也是可以有条件的慎重去作的。
    最后区人民法院还应在区公所指导与协助下，与区内各有关机关及人民团体建立密切的联系，对某些重要案件的审理，一定要请各方面给以帮助，才能把案子办得更好。审判工作应走群众路线，而这样作，才是一条重要的群众路线。
