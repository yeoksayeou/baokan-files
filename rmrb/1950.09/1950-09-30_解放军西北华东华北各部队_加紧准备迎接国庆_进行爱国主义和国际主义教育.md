Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 26th: The People's Liberation Army Northwest Military Region and the First Field Army units are taking practical actions of stepping up production and strengthening internationalism and patriotism education to welcome National Day. A certain unit repairing the Baoji-Tianshui section of the railway launched a movement to create new records at the beginning of this month. The Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia Military Regions have instructed their subordinate units to conduct internationalism and patriotism education in the troops through major political events that have occurred at home and abroad in the past year. The Logistics and Health Department of the Military Region initiated a letter-writing campaign protesting the US imperialist aggression against Korea, Taiwan, and the bombing of our territory by US aircraft. The Gansu Military Region directly affiliated units will hold essay contests with the theme of opposing US imperialist aggression and defending world peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th: The People's Liberation Army East China Military Region and the Third Field Army units are enthusiastically preparing to celebrate the first National Day of the People's Republic of China. The PLA troops stationed in Shanghai will hold a grand military parade on National Day. The Shanghai Garrison Force is preparing to hold a major review of military, political, and cultural achievements around National Day to summarize the achievements made in various aspects over the past year. The troops stationed in Nanjing will participate in the city's grand parade and lantern festival. The Military Region and the Field Army Political Department have instructed their subordinate units to further strengthen the education of loving the motherland, loving the government, and loving the people under the spirit of high internationalism on the basis of carrying out education against US imperialist aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and to encourage all officers and soldiers to build a strong army, navy, and air force, consolidate national defense, liberate Taiwan, and support the struggle of the Korean and Vietnamese people, and defend world peace.

(This Newspaper's News) The anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching. The land and air forces and military organs and factories of the North China Military Region are preparing enthusiastically and intensively for the celebration. The army and air force participating in the National Day review in the capital are rushing to complete the preparations for the review in recent days. All the army and air force units under review feel infinitely honored to appear as representatives of the powerful national land and air forces in the people's capital, where people from all over the country and the world are concentrating their attention. Many organs and units directly under the military region have also launched enthusiastic activities to welcome National Day. The repair factory of the Aviation Department of the Military Region is preparing to hold an exhibition in the Forbidden City on October 1 to introduce aircraft knowledge to the masses. Workers throughout the factory have been working overtime to rush-produce various instruments and models. Workers Zheng Guangkun and Guo Fengjia used their spare time to design and create an ideal standard airport model. It has various runways, houses, gardens, and an airport where hundreds of airplanes can take off and land at the same time, as a gift to National Day and a goal for future efforts. Various factories have also rushed to make more than 20 kinds of exhibits, such as parachuting, lighthouses, and oil pump disassemblies. While preparing to celebrate National Day, commanders and fighters expressed strong resentment towards the US imperialist aggression. The reviewed units held memorial meetings and speech contests to celebrate National Day. Pilots at the meeting expressed their desire to request their superiors to allow them to go to the forefront of the complete liberation of the motherland to complete new tasks. Soldiers of a certain regiment warned the US imperialists: "If the US imperialists dare to invade an inch of our sacred motherland, we have the responsibility to send them to the grave!" Soldiers of all units have written to the Party committees of the division and regiment, expressing their determination to create even more brilliant achievements than last year, so that the war-mongering bandits can clearly recognize the invincible power of the Chinese people and tell them that the rapid growth of the people's power, no matter what struggles the reactionaries make, can hardly escape its destined fate of death?
