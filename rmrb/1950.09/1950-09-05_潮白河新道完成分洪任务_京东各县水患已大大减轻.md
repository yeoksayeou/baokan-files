　　Chao River New Channel Completes Flood Diversion Task
    Waterlogging in Various Counties of Eastern Hebei Greatly Reduced

    [This Newspaper Comprehensive Dispatch] One of the largest water conservancy projects in North China in 1950, the first phase of the Chao River downstream regulation project, has been fully completed. After water release, it has achieved the expected effect of reducing the perennial floods in eight counties including Tongxian, Xianghe, Baodi, and Ninghe in eastern Hebei.

    The entire engineering plan for the Chao River downstream regulation project consists of 28 items. Due to limitations in manpower and material resources, it is impossible to complete all of them within one year. Therefore, it was decided to only undertake the first phase of seven projects this year. The project starts from Suzhuang in Tongxian County in the north and ends at the Dongyin River in Ninghe County in the south, with a total length of over 300 li. The goal is to reduce the perennial floods in the eight counties of Tongxian, Xianghe, Sanhe, Wuqing, Yutian, Jixian, Baodi, and Ninghe in eastern Hebei. The project involves blocking the old course of the Chao River, preventing ordinary floods of 3,000 cubic meters per second from flowing into the Jiyun River through the old course (the capacity of the Jiyun River is only 250 cubic meters per second). Instead, the water is diverted through the Jian River, the new Chao River channel, the Bei Canal, and the Qingwan Diversion Channel, flowing into the Huangzhuang Depression and the temporary reservoirs of Dongdian, Ditou, and Qilihai, and then into the sea through the Xiaowugong River and the Dongyin River.

    The project started in early April this year. After more than 130,000 military and civilian workers worked day and night to rush the construction, it was fully completed on July 10, lasting more than three months, with a total earthwork of more than 11 million cubic meters and a project cost of more than 56 million jin of millet.

    The new Chao River channel began to release water on July 16. On the 18th, the river water rose sharply, with a flow rate of more than 2,000 cubic meters per second. At this time, the blocking and closing of the old channel flowing into the Jiyun River had not yet been completed. In addition to more than 1,400 cubic meters per second of floodwater being discharged into the new channel, there were still 600 cubic meters per second of floodwater flowing into the Jiyun River through the old channel. As a result, the Laogaozhai on the right bank of the Jiyun River breached on July 18, flooding more than 80,000 mu of land. On August 4, the Jiyun River rose for the second time, and its tributary, the Zhou River, breached at Mozhuangzi due to insufficient discharge, flooding more than one million mu of land in Jixian and Yutian counties.

    On August 11, the blocking project of the old channel from the Chao River entering the Jiyun River was completed. After all the Chao River water flowed into the new channel, the Jiyun River banks not only greatly increased the guarantee against flooding, but also the accumulated water in various places along the river this year will be quickly drained, and most areas can be planted with autumn wheat. Low-lying areas can also be spring cultivated next spring. It is now possible to strive to plant 70,000 to 80,000 mu of autumn wheat in the Taihe Depression and Linnancang Depression this year, and about 300,000 mu of cultivated land can be freed up to plant spring wheat next spring. This is something that the people along the Jiyun River have not expected for decades. In addition, the completion of the first phase of the Chao River downstream regulation project has reduced the threat of Chao River floods to the Bei Canal. At the same time, most of the land in the Huangzhuang Depression can also be freed up to plant autumn wheat.

    The Chao River has risen three times since July 18 this year. With the active rescue and protection of the masses along the river, the new Chao River channel has not been in danger. Although more than 2 million mu of farmland were still flooded and waterlogged due to the breaches in Laogaozhai and Mozhuangzi on the Jiyun River this year, compared with the more than 6 million mu of flooded land and 1.3 million affected people last year, the water disasters in the counties of eastern Hebei this year have been greatly reduced. The Hebei Provincial Government has not only telegraphed its encouragement to all the staff of the Chao River Engineering Office, but has also instructed the local governments and the Ji-Luan River Affairs Bureau to actively organize the masses to drain water and rush to plant autumn wheat.

　　潮白河新道完成分洪任务
    京东各县水患已大大减轻
    【本报综合讯】一九五○年华北最大水利工程之一的潮白河下游第一期整理工程，业已全部告竣；经放水后，已达到减轻京东通县、香河、宝坻、宁河等八县连年水灾的预期效果。
    潮白河下游整理工程的全部工程计划，共计二十八项，因受人力、物力限制，不可能在一年内全部完成，故决定今年只举办第一期的七项工程。该工程北起通县苏庄，南迄宁河的东引河，全长三百余华里，以减轻京东通县、香河、三河、武清、玉田、蓟县、宝坻、宁河等八县连年的水灾为目标；堵闭潮白河旧道，使潮白河三千秒公方的普通大水不再由旧道流入蓟运河（按蓟运河容量仅二百五十秒公方），分别由箭杆河、潮白河新河道，以及北运河、青湾减河，流入黄庄洼和东淀、堤头、七里海等临时蓄水池，然后由小蜈蚣河、东引河入海。
    该工程于今年四月上旬开始动工，经十三万军工民工日夜努力赶修，历时三月余，已于七月十日全部完成，共做土工一千一百余万公方，工程费达五千六百余万斤小米。
    潮白河新河道于七月十六日开始放水，十八日河水即猛涨，流量达两千余秒公方，这时流入蓟运河的旧道尚未堵口合龙，除一千四百余秒公方洪水泄入新河道外，仍有六百秒公方洪水由旧道灌入蓟运河，因而蓟运河右岸老高寨于七月十八日决口，淹地八万余亩，八月四日蓟运河第二次涨水，其支流周河因宣泄不及，在莫庄子决口，蓟县、玉田被淹地百余万亩。
    八月十一日由潮白河进入蓟运河的旧道的堵闭工程又已完成，潮白河水全部流入新河道后，蓟运河沿岸不仅大大增加了不再遭受水患的保证，即今年沿岸各地积水也将很快排除，大部地区即可种上秋麦，低洼地区明春亦可进行春耕。现仅太和洼与林南仓洼两地，今年即可争取抢种七、八万亩秋麦，明春可脱出耕地约三十万亩种春麦，这是蓟运河沿岸人民几十年来所料想不到的。此外，由于潮白河下游第一期整理工程的完成，已使潮白河洪水对北运河的威胁减轻；同时黄庄洼一带田地亦可大部脱出种上秋麦。
    潮白河今年从七月十八日起，前后共三次涨水，在沿河群众的积极抢险防护下，潮白河新河道未曾出险；虽然今年蓟运河在老高寨与周河莫庄子两处决口仍有二百余万亩耕地被淹及雨涝成灾，但与去年淹地六百余万亩、受灾人口一百三十余万相较，今年京东各县的水灾是大大减轻了。现河北省府除电勉潮白河工程处全体工作人员外，并已指示各该地政府、蓟滦河务局，积极组织群众进行排水抢种秋麦。（孟新、韩文光、陈作舟、段志远、任杰）
