Regarding the Tsushima Island Issue
    ——Answers to Readers' Questions

    Before August 15th, the maps related to the Korean War published on pages one and four of this newspaper had unclear national border markings. The question of Tsushima Island's ownership was not clearly indicated on the map. This issue has prompted many readers to write inquiries.

    The "Map of the Situation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" given away with the newspaper on August 15th has been corrected, and the national borders are clearly marked. Tsushima Island is outside the border of Korea and is not Korean territory.

　　关于对马岛问题
    ——答读者问
    八月十五日以前，本报在一、四版刊出的有关朝鲜战争的地图，上面国界标志不明确。对马岛谁属的问题，在地图上没有画清楚。此一问题曾引起许多读者来信询问。
    八月十五日本报随报赠送的“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国形势图”，经过了核正，国界划得清晰了。对马岛，是在朝鲜的国界之外，不是朝鲜的国土。
