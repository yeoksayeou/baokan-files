Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 29th (TASS dispatch): *Pravda* published on the 27th a report by its correspondent in Korea, Bochinko, about the heroic defense of Seoul. The reporter wrote: It has been ten days since the 40,000 American and British troops landed at Incheon. According to prisoners of war, the main purpose of this landing operation was to occupy Seoul. During this period, the invading forces have lost a large amount of equipment and manpower, but have failed to complete their mission. MacArthur originally wanted to open a second battlefield by landing, but the recklessness and haste of this landing operation are becoming increasingly apparent.

Before the landing, the British and American combined fleet bombarded the coastal fortifications with intensive artillery fire. However, as soon as the landing began, these warships were met with return fire from Korean artillery, machine guns, and rifles.

Bochinko continued: The resistance of the Korean People's Army caused chaos and panic on the warships. The first attempt to land failed. The warships had to use artillery fire again and called in planes for assistance. A regiment of the People's Army artillery and a battalion of the Marine Corps blocked the enemy's offensive in the first few days. The soldiers fought to their last drop of blood until their heroic sacrifice. None of them retreated.

The General Headquarters of the People's Army and the civil administration authorities took emergency measures to defend Seoul. Local residents worked hard to build fortifications to stop the enemy's infantry and tanks from advancing. Many ordinary people took up arms and went to the front lines. From Incheon to the outskirts of Seoul, the road was littered with the corpses of the invaders. American prisoners of war call this road the road to the grave.

　　英雄的汉城保卫战
    真理报记者  波诚科
    【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报于二十七日发表该报驻朝鲜记者波诚科关于英雄的汉城保卫战的报道。记者写道：自从四万美、英军队在仁川登陆以来，已有十天了。据俘虏供称：这次登陆战的主要目的是要占领汉城。在这段时间中，侵略者的部队已损失了大量的装备与有生力量，但却未能完成他们的任务。麦克阿瑟原想登陆间辟第二战场，但是，这次登陆作战的鲁莽仓促，是越来越明显了。
    在登陆以前，英美混合舰队以密集的炮火轰击海岸工事。但是，登陆一开始，这些军舰就受到了朝鲜大炮、机关枪与步枪火力的回击。
    波诚科继续写道：朝鲜人民军的抵抗引起了军舰上的混乱与恐慌。第一次登陆的企图失败了。军舰又不得不再度用大炮来轰击，并且还调来飞机助战。人民军一个炮兵团及海军陆战队一个营在最初几天中，阻住了敌人的攻势。战士们战斗到流尽最后一滴血，直到壮烈牺牲。他们都没有退却。
    人民军总司令部及民政当局为了保卫汉城，采取了紧急的措施。当地的居民紧张地筑起阻挡敌军步兵与坦克前进的防御工事。许多老百姓都拿起了武器，走向前线。从仁川到汉城近郊，一路上都枕籍着侵略者的尸体。美军俘虏们都把这条路叫作走向坟墓之路。
