　　(Changsha News) According to the New Hunan Daily: Hunan Province has achieved an all-around bumper rice harvest this year. The early rice has been completely harvested, with an average yield of 80-90%; according to materials from Changsha, Yiyang, Changde, Hengyang, Lingling, and Chenzhou prefectures, where the mid-season rice harvest has already begun, the harvest is even better than the early rice, reaching about 90% yield. In the lakefront areas of Changsha Prefecture, each mu yields about six shi of rice (early rice and mid-season rice are about the same); general areas yield four shi and five dou to five shi and five dou per mu, a significant increase from the general yield of three shi and five dou last year; a small number of poorer fields can yield two to three shi of rice per mu; and a small number of disaster-stricken fields yield one to two shi of rice per mu. The entire prefecture's early and mid-season rice averages over 90% yield. In Yiyang, Changde, Hengyang, Shaoyang, and other places, the average yield of early and mid-season rice is above 80-90%; Lingling and Chenzhou prefectures have 70-80%. For the province as a whole, this year's harvest is the first in several years. Many people said, "This year is a full harvest year." Early and mid-season rice account for more than 90% of the total rice production in the province, with late rice accounting for a small amount, so a bumper rice harvest for the entire province is a certainty. Taking the 18th Bao of the 3rd District of Yiyang as an example, the Bao has 7,800 mu of fields. Last year, 4,500 mu were flooded, and the farmers harvested very little. This year, eleven embankment projects were repaired, protecting the rice fields and achieving a bumper harvest. A total of 39,000 shi of early and mid-season rice were harvested (the amount of late rice to be harvested is not included). 1947 was the best harvest year for the Bao in recent years, but this year's output increased by about one time compared to 1947, and increased by about one and a half times compared to last year.
    The farmers have received an unprecedented harvest in recent years and are very happy. In Xiangyang Township, Anxiang, which has always been poor, farmers are buying oxen, adding farm tools, building new houses, and buying cloth. The whole township is showing a new look. People happily said, "This is the blessing that Chairman Mao brought to us."
    At present, most of the late-season and replanted crops in various prefectures of the province have been planted. The late rice in the lakefront area is a lush green. The fields damaged by drought and flooding have also been replanted. In places where early and mid-season rice has been harvested, some farmers are busy with autumn plowing and planting. Some fields in Sanxin Township, Pingjiang, were plowed around August 16th, and some fields have been planted with buckwheat and sorghum.

　　湖南全省稻产丰收
    部分地区开始秋耕秋种
    【长沙讯】新湖南报消息：湖南全省今年稻产丰收。早稻已收割完毕，平均八、九成年景；中稻据已经开始收割的长沙、益阳、常德、衡阳、零陵、郴州等专区材料，收成较早稻还好，约达九成年景。长沙专区的滨湖地区，每亩约产六石稻谷（早稻和中稻相差不多）；一般地区产四石五斗到五石五斗，比去年一般产三石五斗增加很多；少数较差的田每亩可产二、三石稻谷；另有少数受灾田，每亩产一、二石稻谷。整个专区早稻和中稻平均有九成以上年成。益阳、常德、衡阳、邵阳等地早稻、中稻平均在八、九成年景以上；零陵和郴州两专区有七、八成。就全省来说，今年的收成为数年来的第一次。许多群众说：“今年是十足年成。”该省早稻和中稻约占全部稻产数目的十分之九以上，晚稻为数不多，因此全省稻产丰收已成定局。以益阳三区十八保为例，该保有田七千八百亩，去年被渍四千五百亩，农民所收无几；今年修好了渍田垸子十一个，保住了稻田，得到了丰收，早稻和中稻共收三万九千石（晚稻可收数量未计算在内）。一九四七年为该保近数年中收成最好者，但今年产量比一九四七年约增加一倍，比去年增产一倍半左右。
    农民得到了几年来未有的丰收，心情十分愉快。过去一直贫穷的安乡向阳乡，农民纷纷买耕牛，添农具，盖新房，买布匹，全乡一片新气象。人们高兴地说：“这是毛主席带给我们的福气。”
    现该省各专区晚种和补种的作物大部种完，滨湖地区晚禾已一片青葱；旱坏和浸坏的田也都补种齐全；割完早稻和中稻的地方，有些农民又在忙着秋耕秋种，平江三新乡部分田地，已在八月十六日左右犁过，有的田并已种上了荞麦和高粱。
