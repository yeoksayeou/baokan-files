　　Summary of Disaster Relief Work in the Past Year
    ——Report by Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of the Interior, at the National Civil Affairs Conference on July 24, 1950
    We Overcame a Severe Famine
    The famine of 1949 was diverse (mainly floods), widespread, and continuous. It was not only directly caused by U.S. imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, but also the result of long-term rule by the feudal class. Faced with a severe famine, the people in the disaster areas, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, unflinchingly carried out a series of struggles against the disaster for a year and achieved tremendous results.

    In the thousands of years of Chinese history, every major famine resulted in the starvation of millions of people. The old rulers were not responsible for the lives of the people. In 1931, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, 3.7 million people starved to death. Last year was the first year of the Central People's Government, and faced with such a severe famine, it basically ensured the realization of the slogan "No one will starve to death." Although some people did die in some places, which we deeply regret, it was completely different from the historically common scenes of starvation and death everywhere. Moreover, contrary to the historical scene of ruined fields and barren land after a disaster, most of the flooded fields were replanted after drainage, and in some areas, many new fields were even opened up. U.S. imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, tried to take advantage of our serious disaster, pretending to be benevolent and righteous. They arrogantly believed that the Chinese people could not survive last year's severe famine without relying on their charity. The facts show that the Central People's Government and the Chinese people themselves, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have the power and means to overcome any serious disaster. Without any "relief" from imperialism and its running dogs, our disaster relief work is better than at any time in history.

    The reason why we were able to achieve great results and overcome the famine is primarily because we have overthrown the manufacturers of the disaster—imperialism and domestic reactionaries—and relied on the correct leadership of the Central People's Government to mobilize and organize the vast, hardworking, and brave Chinese people to fight the disaster. Secondly, it is because the local people's governments at all levels generally attach importance to this disaster relief work that concerns the lives of millions of people and go all out. The leading cadres went deep into the disaster areas and personally led the work. During this disaster relief work, the cadres demonstrated a heroic style of hard work, active efforts, and sharing weal and woe with the people.

    However, we should not be satisfied with the existing achievements and ignore the shortcomings in our work. In particular, we should pay attention to the fact that the disaster situation has not been completely overcome in some areas, and new serious disasters have occurred in some areas. Our summary is to use the lessons learned from the past to do a better job in future disaster relief work.

    Leadership Style in Disaster Relief Work

    The famine is a strict test for our people's government and cadres. The quality of leadership style is one of the decisive keys to whether we can overcome the famine. At the same time, the quality of leadership style is also most easily demonstrated in disaster relief work. In the disaster relief work of the past year, there are indeed some aspects of leadership style that are worth reviewing:

    First, we must resolutely overcome bureaucratism and promote the style of going deep among the masses. Whenever senior cadres personally go to the countryside, effectively grasp the disaster situation, solve problems in a timely manner, thoroughly check the work, and think of more specific methods, the confidence of cadres and people in overcoming the disaster will be enhanced, and the work will be effective. If we just sit in the office, issue orders, write instructions, make arrangements without inspection, and have no accurate understanding of the disaster situation, we cannot effectively solve the problem.

    Second, we must fully emphasize grasping the disaster situation and oppose complacency and slackness. Whenever the leading organs have sufficient foresight on the development of the disaster situation, can grasp the laws of disaster development, start early, see the future from the present, and arrange work with both good and bad scenarios in mind, the serious disaster can be turned into a lighter one, and the light disaster can be turned into no disaster. If we ignore the disaster situation, lack an overall view, attend to one thing and lose sight of another, focus on the seriously affected areas and relax on the lightly affected areas, pay attention to the local disaster victims and ignore the foreign disaster victims, pay attention to the flooded areas and ignore the mountainous disaster areas, the work will inevitably fall into passivity, and the disaster situation will tend to develop.

    Third, we must promote democracy, mobilize the masses, and oppose commandism. Convening disaster area people's representative conferences (or farmer representative conferences, disaster victim representative conferences, etc.) is the best way to conduct disaster relief work. Experience has proved that in such meetings, everyone discusses disaster relief methods, concentrates collective wisdom, and promotes experience, which will greatly enhance disaster relief confidence, give a strong impetus to the work, and effectively overcome the cadres' coercive orders, and avoid many deviations in the work.

    Fourth, we must regard disaster relief work as an extremely important comprehensive political task. Governments at all levels must be headed by the top leader and concentrate the strength of various departments under unified leadership to coordinate actions. The production and disaster relief committees at all levels are the organizational forms for organizing all aspects of power and unified leadership of disaster relief work. In disaster areas, we should concentrate all our efforts with disaster relief work as the center, and combine other work with disaster relief work.

    Guiding Principles and Policies for Disaster Relief Work

    The characteristics of the people's government's disaster relief policy are: (1) Active: Actively leading the masses to find a way out in production, rather than simply providing relief. All our specific measures are aimed at solving people's difficulties by developing production and increasing social wealth. (2) Mass-based: Adhering to the mass line, making disaster relief a mass social movement. Opposing the cadres' condescending views and eliminating the masses' dependence mentality. (3) Long-term: Taking care of both the immediate temporary interests and the fundamental interests of the future, combining both palliative and fundamental solutions.

    Under such a policy, we have taken various production and disaster relief measures. Now we will review some of the main issues.

    First, on the issue of sideline production:

    (1) Mobilizing the masses to carry out sideline production must be diversified, focused, and supported. Launching various sideline production movements, mobilizing all full labor and half labor forces, to achieve "no idle people in the village, regardless of men, women, old, or young." However, sideline production must be based on actual possible conditions and "adapted to local conditions," and no orders can be issued based on subjective opinions. The characteristics of rural sideline production are diversity and seasonality, so it must also be "adapted to the times," and disaster victims must be organized to change jobs according to seasonal changes so that production can continue without interruption. It is necessary to strengthen leadership, especially to strengthen the planning of leadership, and to support the development of certain sideline production with emphasis and planning according to production and sales conditions. Generally, it is not necessary to launch products without sales, and it is not necessary to launch products with few sales extensively.

    (2) To lead the sideline production in the disaster areas, the people's own strength must be combined with the support of the state, and the principle of taking into account both public and private interests and small profits and large sales must be implemented. On the issue of production funds, we mainly rely on the masses to use methods such as "turning dead money into living money," free lending, and labor-capital cooperation to raise funds themselves. At the same time, the state should also provide necessary support by issuing loan grains, bank credit, ordering and deferred transportation. On the sales front, leaders and the masses must work together. We must avoid the dependent view of relying entirely on the government to solve the sales problem. State trading agencies must make overall plans for the main products and provide purchasing and marketing support in a planned and step-by-step manner. At the same time, it is also necessary to prevent producers from demanding higher purchase prices for high profits, as well as the two deviations of certain economic sector workers not accounting for costs when purchasing sideline products, "contracting but not selling," and arbitrarily lowering purchase prices, even completely refusing to accept "cold goods."

    In the development of sideline production, we must use two driving organizational forces, namely, the organization of industry representative conferences and the contract system of supply and marketing cooperatives. Experience has proved that the form of industry representative conferences has played a good role in exchanging experience, studying technology, formulating production plans, signing contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, and organizing mass production. The main roles of implementing the contract system are: First, state-owned trading agencies and supply and marketing cooperatives use the method of signing purchase and sales contracts to organize the vast number of small producers under the leadership of the state-owned economy, and can carry out more planned production. Second, guarantee the sales of major sideline production. Third, guarantee the reasonable profits of farmers' sideline production, increase the confidence of disaster victims, and greatly promote sideline production. Fourth, the cooperative's business goes deep into the countryside, organizes farmers' economic mutual aid groups, obtains extensive credit from farmers, and consolidates the foundation for cooperative development.

    Second, on social mutual assistance: Social mutual assistance includes the following forms:

    First, collective mutual assistance production between disaster victims and non-disaster victims. Second, free lending. Third, non-disaster area urban and rural fundraising and resettlement of famine refugees. Fourth, the movement of government agencies, troops, and organizations to save one or two liters of rice (up to four liters of rice). Fundraising is mainly to mobilize non-disaster areas to support disaster areas, and free lending can be widely implemented, but it is mainly applicable within lightly affected areas. Experience has proved that by widely promoting free lending and implementing the free lending policy, the government does not need strong support in the lightly affected areas, and can survive the famine. Fundraising and free lending must focus on publicizing policies, dispel the masses' ideological concerns, strictly adhere to the principle of voluntariness, and resolutely avoid administrative apportionment and coercive orders, otherwise they will be divorced from the masses, freeze the existing mutual assistance and mutual relief relations, and block the channels for disaster victims to borrow money.

    Third, on the issue of work-for-relief: In the past year, work-for-relief has completed more than 580 million cubic meters of water conservancy projects, and more than 3 million disaster victims participated in the construction of water conservancy projects, and about 10 million people, including their families, depended on it for their livelihoods. In the disaster relief work of work-for-relief, the experience and lessons learned are: water management should focus on fundamental solutions, overall planning, unified leadership, coordinated implementation, partial obedience to the whole, small interests obedience to large interests, and there should be correct plans, careful organization, and sufficient preparation in the work to avoid waste of human, financial, and time resources.

    Fourth, on the issue of disaster relief grain: It is absolutely necessary for the state to take out a batch of grain to subsidize the disaster victims' production funds and implement reasonable relief. However, the state's grain must be appropriately allocated to various disaster areas to avoid imbalances in urgency and confusion in light and heavy. The grain allocated to the disaster areas must be used in a timely manner, distributed rationally, and used properly. The state's emergency grain can only guarantee that people will not starve to death if it is distributed in a timely manner. Therefore, we must oppose the practice of withholding grain and not releasing it and mobilizing it at all levels. The distribution of relief grain must follow the principle that "the process of distribution is the process of organizing production," and we must also take care of the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and the old, weak, disabled, and sick. There should be in-depth mass work, detailed investigation and research, neither aimlessly distributing evenly, nor overemphasizing centralized use. When distributing, we must promote democracy and avoid favoritism. Before distribution, we must obtain the disaster victims' guarantee to start production. After distribution, we must check the situation of its use in production.

    Fifth, on the issue of handling disaster victims fleeing famine: 1. Do not allow disaster victims to flee blindly and disorderly. Blindly fleeing famine is not in line with the policy of self-salvation through production. This will not only increase social chaos, but also increase the local government's difficulty in taking care of those who flee to other places, and it is easy for people to starve to death. 2. Preventing disaster victims from fleeing randomly is not to force disaster victims to sit and wait for death, but to lead disaster victims to produce locally. We must make disaster victims understand that blindly fleeing famine is not a solution through publicity and explanation, and only by finding a way out in production can the disaster victims' turbulent emotions turn stable and their confidence in persisting locally increase. 3. Necessary evacuation and immigration should be organized and planned: For disaster victims in severely affected areas who do not have the conditions to persist locally in a short period of time, such as standing water that does not recede and have lost the conditions for restoring agricultural production, it is also necessary to immigrate to other places, in addition to helping them change jobs or resettle them nearby. However, this is a complex and meticulous task, and it must be negotiated properly with relevant parties in advance, planned carefully, and the work of publicity, mobilization, organization, escort, and resettlement must be done well, and sufficient travel expenses to reach the destination must be raised before it can be carried out. 4. If disaster victims have already fled to a certain area, the local government must mobilize the masses in non-disaster areas to promote the spirit of friendship, mutual assistance, and cooperation, and resettle foreign disaster victims so as not to cause anxiety to both hosts and guests and disrupt order. They shall not be repatriated casually without consulting with the original place. If City A sends them to City B, City B sends them to City C, and City C sends them to City A again, sending them back and forth will not solve the actual problem, but will waste a large amount of public repatriation fees and cultivate a group of lazy people who eat "travel meals" and do not engage in production. 5. When the spring plowing season arrives, we must organize the disaster victims who have fled abroad to return to their hometowns for spring plowing in a timely and appropriate manner to develop agricultural production.

  Strive for Continued Disaster Relief and Long-Term Disaster Prevention
    Although the spring famine has passed, there are still wind, hail, drought, insects, and other disasters of varying sizes everywhere after entering summer. The most serious is the flood in the Huai River Basin. The water level and flow rate are the highest in seventy years. Due to the major floods in the Huai River Basin of northern Anhui and Henan this time, it further proves that China's floods are not only the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, but other slightly larger rivers can also break out floods every year. Floods are indeed a major disaster for the Chinese people and cannot be overcome in a short period of time. Disaster relief and prevention should become an important task of the people's government for a considerable period of time.

  In the future, for continued disaster relief and long-term disaster prevention, attention should be paid to the following points:

    1. The situation in the disaster area should be reported comprehensively and correctly, and the reported numbers should not be exaggerated or reduced. How many acres of affected farmland are there in total, and the standard for being affected should be clear and consistent (the Central Ministry of the Interior once instructed: Those with a harvest of less than 20% to no harvest are considered severely affected, those with 20% to 50% are considered lightly affected, and those with more than 60% are not considered disasters), and explain how many people are affected (how many need immediate relief, how many need long-term relief, and how many do not need relief), and how many people have died (including those who starved to death, froze to death, and died of illness due to freezing and starvation; general deaths due to illness should not be mixed in). Only in this way can the higher-level organs grasp the comprehensive and correct situation, and can issue appropriate instructions in a timely manner. Only then can cadres at all levels have a clear understanding of the overall disaster situation, and can they correctly implement the central disaster relief policy.

    2. We must be constantly familiar with the disaster situation and disaster relief work. Leaders of the people's government, especially those responsible for local people's governments, should conduct regular investigations and research on the types of disasters, the laws of the occurrence and development of disasters, the living conditions of the masses, traffic conditions, the basis of sideline industries, and the disaster relief methods of prevention in advance and handling afterward, so that they can become skilled disaster relief workers.

    3. We must create a mass movement of disaster relief and prevention with leadership. Governments at all levels must repeatedly publicize to the people: establish a firm and long-term ideology of self-salvation through production, so that the people have the consciousness of "disaster relief in case of disaster, and disaster prevention in case of no disaster," and cooperate with the three major tasks of establishing political power, land reform, and demobilization to lead, encourage, and organize the people to take concrete actions.

    4. Properly protect public grain, sort out charity granaries, and establish new charity granaries under possible conditions. Establish the concept of people protecting national wealth, being prepared for danger in times of peace, and storing grain to prevent famine.

    5. We must vigorously implement work-for-relief and turn floods into water conservancy. In accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions, starting this year, we must make every effort to fundamentally cure the Huai River flood. The water conservancy projects that are about to start should be combined with relief, and should be started as early as possible during the agricultural gap; we should use the dry season to hold some projects in advance; we should pay attention to the quality of the projects; we should always carefully check the loopholes in the dikes and all engineering equipment, and do a good job in preparing for flood prevention and rescue. In some places, we should dig wells, open canals, store floods, dig ponds, build reservoirs, and prepare for drought resistance and flood prevention.

    6. We must widely carry out the movement to save money and prepare for famine. Advocate frugality, eating more coarse grains, storing wild vegetables and various substitutes, and storing seeds of various early-maturing crops. Governments at all levels should especially learn from past lessons and store a large number of seeds for temporary replanting at ordinary times.

    7. We must vigorously develop agricultural production with the organization of cooperatives. On the existing basis, promote the development of rural sideline industries and cooperative transportation and marketing in a planned manner. Expand and strengthen the social influence of supply and marketing cooperatives, and make them a basic driving force for the regular development of agricultural production.

    8. We must learn to lead production and formulate comprehensive and long-term disaster relief plans. Disaster relief and prevention are also a series of economic work to organize the people to carry out agriculture, sideline industries, and handicrafts. Cadres in charge of disaster relief from the central to the local levels must also learn to lead production, learn to calculate carefully, and organize meticulously. Disaster relief committees from the central to the local levels must study and formulate effective disaster relief plans for various departments in the next period.

    9. Local governments at all levels should continue to focus on production and disaster relief in areas where disasters have not passed. Strengthen the organization of the production and disaster relief committee, improve its leadership, combine it with the current campaign to rectify cadres, seriously check and summarize the past disaster relief work, earnestly accept experiences and lessons, strengthen future famine preparation arrangements, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Oppose bureaucratic and commandist styles of work. Implement reasonable rewards and punishments, and make clear what is right and wrong.

    The Chinese people have won the victory in the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and we believe that we will also win the victory in the struggle against natural disasters. As long as we are good at relying on the masses, strive to improve our work, and persist in fighting to overcome disasters, any difficulties can be overcome.

　　一年来的救灾工作总结
    ——内务部陈其瑗副部长一九五零年七月二十四日在全国民政会议上的报告
    我们战胜了一次严重的灾荒
    一九四九年的灾荒，种类多（主要是水灾），地区广，灾情连续，不仅是美帝与蒋介石匪帮直接造成，也是封建阶级长期统治的结果。在严重的灾荒面前，灾区人民在中国共产党及中央人民政府的领导下，不屈不挠，一年来进行了一系列的和灾荒作斗争的工作，获得了巨大的成绩。
    在几千年来的中国历史上，每逢一次大的灾荒，总有成千百万的人饿死。旧统治者对于人民的生命是不负责的。一九三一年在国民党反动统治下，饿死了三百七十万人。去年是中央人民政府刚刚成立的一年，面临着如此严重的灾荒，却基本上保证了“不饿死人”的口号的实现。虽然有的地方也死了一些人，这是我们深感痛心的，但与历史上饿殍遍野死亡载道的景象，迥然不同。而且还与历史上灾后田园荒芜赤地千里的景象相反，绝大部分被淹田地排水之后都补种上了，有些地区甚至还新开了不少耕地。美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮在我们的严重灾荒中尚欲乘机取巧，假仁假义。他们狂妄地以为中国人民不倚靠他们的施舍，就度不过去年那样严重的灾荒。事实显示：在毛主席领导下的中央人民政府和中国人民自己完全有力量、有办法战胜任何严重的灾荒。不要任何帝国主义及其走狗的“赈救”，我们的救灾工作比历史上任何时期做得更好。
    我们之所以能够获得很大成绩，战胜灾荒，首先是由于我们已经打倒了灾荒的制造者——帝国主义和国内反动派，依靠中央人民政府的正确领导，将广大、勤劳、勇敢的中国人民自己的力量发动和组织起来，向灾荒搏斗。其次是由于各级地方人民政府一般地重视这关系千百万人生死的救灾工作，全力以赴。首长深入灾区，亲自领导，干部在这次救灾工作中，表现了艰苦卓绝，积极努力，与人民同甘苦，共生死的英勇作风。
    但我们丝毫也不应当满足于已有的成绩，而忽视工作中的缺点，特别应该注意有些地区灾情并未完全克服，有些地区严重的新灾又已发生。我们的总结就是为了运用过去的经验教训，把今后的救灾工作做得更好。
    救灾工作的领导作风
    灾荒对我们人民政府和干部是一个严格的考验。领导作风的好坏是我们能否战胜灾荒的决定关键之一。同时，领导作风的好坏在救灾工作中也最容易表现。在一年多的救灾工作中，领导作风上也确还有值得检讨的：
    第一、必须力戒官僚主义，发扬深入群众的作风。凡是高级干部，亲自下乡，切实掌握灾情，及时解决问题，深入检查工作，多想具体办法，干部和人民战胜灾荒的信心就会增强，工作就会有成效。如果只是坐在机关，发命令，写指示，有布置，无检查，对灾情心无确数，不能及时发现问题，就不能有效地解决问题。
    第二、必须充分重视掌握灾情，反对麻痹松懈。凡是领导机关对灾情的发展有足够的预见，能够掌握灾情发展的规律，及早动手，从现在看到未来，布置工作能够从好坏两方面打算，就可使重灾变轻，轻灾变无。如果忽视灾情，缺乏全面观点，顾此失彼，抓紧重灾区，放松了轻灾区，注意了本地灾民，忽视了外来灾民，注意了水淹灾区，忽视了山岳灾区，工作必然陷于被动，灾情会日趋于发展。
    第三、必须发扬民主，动员群众，反对命令主义，召开灾区人民代表会议（或农民代表会议、灾民代表会议等），是救灾工作中最好的一种方式。经验证明，在这类的会议上，大家讨论救灾办法，集中群智，推广经验，会大大增强救灾信心，予工作以有力推动，并可以有效地克服干部的强迫命令作风，可以避免许多工作中的偏差。
    第四、必须把救灾工作当作极端重要的全面政治任务来看待。各级政府必须首长负责，在统一领导下，集中各部门力量，配合行动。各级的生产救灾委员会就是组织各方面力量，统一领导救灾工作的组织形式。在灾区应集中全力以救灾工作为中心，使其他工作与救灾工作结合。
    关于救灾工作的方针政策
    人民政府的救灾方针的特点是：（１）积极的：积极领导群众在生产上找出路，而不是单纯的救济。我们的一切具体措施，都是以发展生产增加社会财富来解决人民困难为目的。（２）群众的：坚持群众路线，使救灾成为群众性的社会运动。反对干部的恩赐观点，消除群众的依赖思想。（３）长远的：既照顾目前的一时的利益，也照顾将来的根本的利益，治标与治本兼顾。
    在这样的方针下我们采取了各项生产救灾的措施，现在我们就把其中主要的几个问题加以检讨。
    第一、关于副业生产问题：
    （一）发动群众进行副业生产，必须多样发展，重点支持，展开各种各样的副业生产运动，把全劳动力与半劳动力发动起来，做到“男女老少村无闲人”。但副业生产必须根据实际可能的条件，“因地制宜”，不能凭主观发命令。农村副业生产的特点是多样性和季节性，因此又必须“因时制宜”，随着季节的变迁，有计划地组织灾民转业，才能使生产连续不停。必须加强领导，特别是加强领导的计划性，要根据产销情况有重点有计划地扶持一定的副业生产的发展。没有销路的一般不要发动，销路不多的不要普遍发动。
    （二）领导灾区的副业生产，必须使群众自己的力量与国家支持的力量相结合，必须实行公私兼顾，薄利广销的原则。在生产资金的问题上，主要依靠群众用“变死钱为活钱”，自由借贷，劳资合作等办法，自己筹措。同时国家也要用发放贷粮，银行信贷，订货赊运等方法予以必要的支持。在销路上必须领导与群众一齐动手，不要有完全靠公家解决销路问题的依赖观点。国家贸易机关必须在主要产品上，通盘筹划，有计划、有步骤地予以购销的支持。但同时也要防止生产者要求抬高收价的厚利思想以及某些经济部门工作者对副业产品的收购，不计成本，“包而不销”和随意降低收购价格，以至完全拒收“冷货”这两种偏差。
    在发展副业生产中，要运用两个推动的组织力量，即行业代表会议的组织和供销合作社的合同制。经验证明：通过行业代表会议的形式在交流经验，研究技术、订定生产计划、与供销合作社订立合同、组织群众生产等方面均起了良好作用。实行合同制的主要作用：一、国营贸易机关与供销合作社用订立购销合同的办法，把广大的小生产者组织到国营经济领导之下，可以进行比较有计划的生产。二、保证主要副业生产的销路。三、保证农民副业生产的合理利润，使灾民的信心增加，对副业生产起了很大的推动作用。四、使合作社的业务深入农村，组织农民的经济互助团体，取得农民的广大信用，巩固了合作的发展基础。
    第二、关于社会互济：社会互济包括以下几种形式：
    一是灾民与非灾民的集体互助生产，二是自由借贷，三是非灾区城乡的募集捐助与安置逃荒灾民，四是机关部队团体的节约一两米（直至四两米）运动。募集捐助主要是发动非灾区支援灾区，自由借贷可以普遍实行，但主要适用于轻灾区内。经验证明，广泛地提倡自由借贷，贯彻自由借贷政策，在轻灾区内，政府不用大力支持，即可度过灾荒。募集捐助、自由借贷必须着重宣传政策，解除群众思想顾虑，严守自愿原则，力戒行政摊派和强迫命令，不然就会脱离群众，冻结已有的互助互济关系，堵塞灾民告贷的门路。
    第三、关于以工代赈问题：一年来经过以工代赈完成水利工程共达五亿八千万公方以上，参加兴修水利工程的灾民超过三百万人，连其家属计算约有一千万人赖以生活。在以工代赈的救灾工作中，经验教训是：治水要着重治本，通盘筹划，统一领导，协同进行，部分服从全体，小利服从大利，工作上要有正确的计划，周密的组织，充足的准备，力避人力、财力和时间上的浪费。
    第四、关于救灾粮食问题：国家拿出一批粮食补助灾民的生产资金，实行合理的赈济，是完全必要的。但国家的粮食必须适当地分拨各个灾区，避免缓急失调，轻重混淆。分拨到灾区的粮食必须运用及时，分配合理，使用得当。国家救急的粮食，只有发放及时才能保证不饿死人。因此要反对压粮不放和层层机动的作法。发放救济粮要遵循“发放的过程即组织生产的过程”的原则，也要照顾到烈军工属及老弱废疾。要有深入的群众工作，精细的调查研究，既不要无目的地平均分配，也不要过分强调集中使用。发放时，要发扬民主，避免偏私。发放前要取得灾民动手生产的保证。发放后，又要检查其用于生产的情况。
    第五、关于处理灾民逃荒问题：一、不使灾民盲目乱逃。盲目逃荒与生产自救的方针不相符合，这不仅会增加社会的混乱现象，而且逃到外地又增加当地政府的照顾困难，容易发生饿死人的事。二、防止灾民乱逃不是强迫灾民坐以待毙，而是领导灾民就地生产，必须经过宣传解释使灾民知道盲目逃荒不是办法，并在生产上找到出路，才能使灾民动荡情绪转稳，就地坚持的信心增加。三、必要的疏散移民要有组织有计划：在短时间没有就地坚持条件，如积水不退，已丧失恢复农业生产条件的重灾区的灾民，除帮助转业或就近安置外，向外移民也是必要的。但这是一件复杂细致的工作，必须与有关方面事先协商妥当，计划周密，做好宣传、动员、组织、护送安置等工作，并筹足到达目的地的路费，才好进行。四、如果灾民已经逃到某一地区，当地政府必须动员非灾区群众发扬友爱互济合作精神，安置外来灾民，才不至发生主客不安、扰乱秩序的事。非经过与原地协商不得随便遣回。如果甲城送至乙城，乙城送至丙城，丙城又送甲城，送来送去，既不能解决实际问题，徒然耗了公家大笔遣送费，养成一批吃“旅行饭”不事生产的游惰者。五、春耕季节到来时，必须及时妥善地组织外逃灾民回乡春耕，发展农业生产。
  为继续救灾长期防灾而斗争
    今年春荒虽然度过，入夏后，各处仍有大小不等的风、雹、旱、虫等灾。最严重的是淮河流域水灾。水位之高，流量之速为七十年来所未有。由于此次皖北、河南淮河流域发生重大水灾，更证明中国的水患，不只是黄河、长江，其他稍大的河流，每年均可爆发水灾。水灾确是中国人民的大患，而非短时间所能克服。救灾防灾在相当长的时间内应成为人民政府的重要工作。
  今后对于继续救灾，长期防灾，应注意以下各点：
    一、要全面正确地报道灾区情况，报告数目不可浮夸或缩减。受灾田亩的总数有多少，受灾的标准要明确一致（中央内务部曾经指示：凡收成在二成以下至无收成者为重灾，二成以上至五成者为轻灾，六成以上不为灾），说明受灾人口有多少（需要立即救济者多少，需要长期救济者多少，不需救济者多少），死人有多少（包括饿死、冻死及因冻饿而病死者，一般病死者勿混入）。只有这样，上级机关才能掌握全面正确的情况，才能及时发布适当的指示。各级干部才能对全面灾情心中有数，才能正确执行中央救灾政策。
    二、要经常熟悉灾荒情况和救灾工作。人民政府领导者特别是地方人民政府负责人对于灾荒的种类，灾荒的发生和发展的规律，群众的生活状况，交通的条件，副业的基础，以及事先防治，事后处理的救灾办法，均应经常进行调查研究，使自己成为熟练的救灾工作人员。
    三、要把救灾防灾造成一个有领导的群众性运动。各级人民政府要向人民反复宣传：树立坚定的长期生产自救思想，使人民有“有灾救灾，无灾防灾”的自觉，并配合建政、土改、复员三大任务去领导、鼓舞、组织人民具体行动起来。
    四、妥善保护公粮，整理义仓，在可能的条件下建立新义仓。树立人民保护国家财富，有备无患、积谷防饥的观念。
    五、要大力实行以工代赈，把水灾变成水利。依照毛主席的指示，自今年开始，要用全力把淮河水患根本治好。即将动手的水利工程，要结合救济，尽可能在农隙开工；要利用枯水季节，提前举办部分工程；要注意工程质量；要随时认真检查堤防漏洞及一切工程设备，做好防汛抢险的准备工作。有些地方要掘井、开渠、蓄洪、挖塘、建造水库、作抗旱防淹的准备。
    六、要广泛开展节约备荒运动。提倡省吃俭用，多吃粗粮，储备野菜以及各种代食品，储备各种早熟作物种籽。各级政府尤应接受过去教训，在平时储备大量各样临时补种的种籽。
    七、要用合作社的组织，大力发展农业生产。在已有基础上，有计划地推进农村副业，合作运销的发展。扩大及加强供销合作社的社会影响，使之成为经常发展农业生产的基本推动力量。
    八、要学会领导生产，订立通盘长远的救灾计划，救灾防灾也是一系列组织人民进行农业、副业、手工业的经济工作。中央以至地方主管救灾的干部同样必须学会领导生产，学会精打细算，精密组织。中央以至地方救灾委员会，必须研究订出下一期各部门的救灾有效计划。
    九、各级地方政府在灾荒未度过的地区，仍以生产救灾为中心工作。加强生产救灾委员会的组织，健全其领导，结合目前整干运动，认真检查，总结过去的救灾工作，切实接受经验教训，加强今后的备荒布置，开展批评与自我批评。反对官僚主义和命令主义作风。实行合理奖惩，是非分明。
    中国人民在反帝反封建反官僚资本的人民革命中已经取得胜利，相信在抗御天灾的斗争中也将同样取得胜利。只要我们善于依靠群众，力求改进工作，坚持不懈地为战胜灾害而斗争，任何困难都是可以克服的。
