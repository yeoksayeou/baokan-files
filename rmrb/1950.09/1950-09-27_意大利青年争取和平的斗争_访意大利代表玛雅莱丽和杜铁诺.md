　　The Struggle of Italian Youth for Peace
    Interview with Italian Representatives Maya Leri and Du Tierno
    In today's Italy, two situations have emerged: on the one hand, the vast majority of the people are living in increasing poverty under the enslavement of American imperialism and the tyranny of Gasperi; on the other hand, the wave of people's struggle for peace is unprecedentedly high. On the second day of the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation's visit to Beijing, reporters interviewed the Italian representatives Maya Leri and Du Tierno, who introduced to the reporters the current living and struggle situation of Italian youth.
    The living conditions of Italian youth today are very bad. According to the latest statistics from the Italian government, the number of unemployed youth in Italy is 400,000, but in fact, at least one million young people in Italy cannot find jobs. Last year, the Italian Communist Youth League and other democratic youth groups conducted a nationwide unemployment survey to expose the truth of the Gasperi government's tyranny. The results of the survey showed that six out of ten young people in rural areas are unemployed, and the unemployment situation for young workers is even more serious.
    The situation of young students is also very difficult. Due to the increase in tuition fees, the number of students has decreased significantly. Italy originally had 190,000 university students, but now it has decreased to 149,000.
    The number of illiterate people is also constantly increasing. Last year, among the seven million school-age children, more than two million were out of school. Due to poor living conditions, the health of Italian youth is also very poor. In a survey near Rome, 1,125 out of 4,000 people suffered from lung disease. In general, in large cities, at least 44 percent of young people are sick or weak, which is due to malnutrition.
    The Italian reactionary government is pursuing Mussolini's policy of sending women back to the kitchen, not allowing them to interfere in politics, and depriving them of work opportunities. Many women are unable to support their children due to unemployment, and many children have to help their mothers find food in the garbage.
    The Italian economic crisis is so serious, but the reactionary government continues to increase the military budget. Now it is desperately strengthening the suppression of the people and is formulating laws restricting strikes, freedom of assembly, and demonstrations.
    Italian youth are persisting in the struggle against enslavement and oppression in difficult circumstances. Young workers generally use strikes as a weapon to fight for democracy and rights. In southern Italy, young unemployed workers have launched a movement to occupy wasteland.
    Italian youth have realized that their struggle to win their own rights is inseparable from the struggle to defend world peace. The peasants put forward a solemn slogan: "We want land, not war." In 1949, when American military commissioner Jacobs went to Italy, young workers and the people held demonstrations, strongly opposing the war preparations conspiracy of the imperialist warmongers.
    The Italian Communist Youth League is uniting an increasing number of young people to participate in the struggle to defend world peace. In January 1949, the Italian Communist Youth League already had 200,000 members, and by February of this year, it had increased to 500,000. Including other progressive youth organizations, more than one million young people are united in the struggle. The peace signature campaign is also surging in Italy, and young people are enthusiastically participating in this movement. In Italy, young people have collected 4.5 million peace signatures. In Rome, the Communist Youth League collected 100,000 signatures in seven days. The Italian Communist Youth League is uniting with Italian democratic youth and all youth organizations to fight for a better future and a happy life. (Attached picture)

### 意大利青年争取和平的斗争  访意大利代表玛雅莱丽和杜铁诺

　　意大利青年争取和平的斗争
    访意大利代表玛雅莱丽和杜铁诺
    在今天的意大利出现了两种情况：一方面是广大的人民在美帝国主义的奴役和加斯贝里的暴政下生活愈趋贫困，一方面是人民争取和平斗争的浪潮空前高涨。在世界青联代表团来到北京的第二天，记者访问了意大利代表玛雅莱丽和杜铁诺，他们向记者介绍了目前意大利青年的生活与斗争的情况。
    今天意大利青年的生活条件是非常恶劣的，根据最近意大利政府的统计，意大利的青年失业人数是四十万，但事实上意大利至少有一百万青年找不到职业。去年意大利共产主义青年联盟与其他各民主青年团体做了一次全国性的失业调查，来揭破加斯贝里政府暴政的真相，调查的结果，在农村十个青年中有六个失业，而青年工人的失业情形更加严重。
    青年学生的境况也是非常困难的。因为学费的增加，学生数目大减，意大利原有大学生十九万，现在已减少到十四万九千人。
    文盲的数字亦在不断增加中，去年七百万学龄儿童中其中却有二百多万失学。意大利青年因为生活条件的低下，健康情况亦非常恶劣。在罗马近郊的一次调查中，四千人有一千一百二十五名患肺病。一般大城市中，最少有百分之四十四的青年是有病或体质衰弱的，这都是由于营养不良的原故。
    意大利反动政府对于妇女是奉行墨索里尼让妇女回到厨房去的政策，不让她们过问政治，剥夺了她们工作的机会。许多妇女因为失业而无法养活孩子，许多儿童只好帮着母亲在垃圾堆中找食物。
    意大利经济危机情况是如此的严重，但是反动政府却不断增加军费的预算。现在并拚命加强对人民的镇压，正在制定限制罢工、集会自由及示威游行的法令。
    意大利的青年正在艰苦的环境中坚持着反对奴役与压迫的斗争。青年工人普遍以罢工作为争取民主与权利的武器。在意大利南部，青年失业工人展开占领荒地运动。
    意大利青年已认识到他们争取自己权利的斗争是与保卫世界和平的斗争分不开的。农民们提出了严正的口号：“要土地，不要战争。”一九四九年，当美国军事特派员杰柯斯到意大利时，青年工人与人民，举行了示威，他们强烈地反对帝国主义战争贩子备战的阴谋。
    意大利的共产主义青年联盟，团结着日益增多的青年参加保卫世界和平的斗争。一九四九年一月意大利共产主义青年联盟已有二十万人，今年二月已增到五十万，加上其他进步青年组织所领导的，已有一百多万青年团结在一道进行斗争。和平签名运动亦正在意大利澎湃展开，青年们热烈地参加了这个运动，在意大利由青年征集的和平签名已达四百五十万。在罗马，共产主义青年联盟在七天内就征集了十万人的签名。意大利共产主义青年团正联合着意大利民主青年与一切青年组织，为争取美好的将来，幸福的生活而斗争着。（附图片）
