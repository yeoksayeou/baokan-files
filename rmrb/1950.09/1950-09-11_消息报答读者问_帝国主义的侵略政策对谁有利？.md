　　Who Benefits from Imperialist Aggression Policies?

　　A "News" reader, Ivanov (Gorky City), requests clarification: What role do the big capitalists on Wall Street play in the aggressive policies of the American government?

　　"News" publishes Branov's reply as follows:

　　The big capitalists of Wall Street are the promoters of aggressive policies. The Truman government is implementing this aggressive policy for the benefit of American monopoly capitalists.

　　Not long ago, "The Wall Street Journal" published a report on a meeting of three hundred major industrial capitalists. This meeting was initiated by the National Munitions Board – the supreme command for militarizing the American economy. Howard, the head of the National Munitions Board, delivered a long speech at the meeting. He explained how the new war is needed for the massive "enterprise," that is, for banking and industrial speculation. Howard also announced a fact that greatly satisfied the audience: in the first six months of this "extraordinary situation," the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force gave American industry 41 billion US dollars in orders.

　　Howard's speech, a typical representative of the dollar tycoons, has best proved that war is the most suitable source of wealth for big capitalists. As is well known, the Second World War brought enormous profits to American industries and financial groups.

　　In 1939, before the war, the profits of American stock companies were 6.4 billion US dollars. During the war, profits increased many times. In 1942, the total profits of five American joint-stock companies exceeded 100 times the average annual profit from 1936 to 1939. Another thirty-four companies exceeded ten times, and another forty-eight companies exceeded three times. In 1943 alone, American financial groups made a profit of 24 billion US dollars. The total amount of net profit obtained by American industrial groups during the war years was over 53 billion US dollars.

　　The American government's domestic and foreign policies in the post-war period – expansionist and aggressive policies – are entirely in the service of the interests of American monopoly capital.

　　The big capitalists of Wall Street have found a way out of the pressing economic crisis in the United States by preparing and instigating new wars in the midst of fierce arms races, in the midst of the ignited military "boom," and in determining America's world hegemony. This prospect of war is extremely tempting to the likes of Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon, DuPont, and other financial magnates, because it promises them new and enormous wealth. The "cold war" policy and arms race pursued by the Truman government in recent years have expanded the wealth of American capitalists by hundreds of billions of dollars. According to a report published by United Press, the total value of the assets (property, securities, etc.) of fifty-six industrial groups increased from 103.5 billion to 135 billion US dollars in two years (from 1947 to 1949). The asset value of six joint-stock companies, mainly belonging to the Morgan and Rockefeller groups, expanded by 8.5 billion US dollars during these two years. This rich dollar harvest of American monopoly capitalists is the result of the aggressive policies pursued by the Truman government.

　　We can understand how great the power behind the American government, manipulating all its activities, is, by looking at the activities of the Atomic Energy Control Commission and the various agencies it organizes.

　　The members of the committee are actually the fully authorized agents of Wall Street. Through these people, Wall Street seized control of atomic energy production and made the government determine policies suitable for its own interests.

　　Wall Street's control over the Truman government's policies was particularly strengthened in 1947, when the so-called "Industrial Advisory Group" was organized under the committee. Not long ago, according to the United Labor Press of America, the participants in this group were all people representing the interests of the largest American industries and financial groups. Among them are James Pike, general manager of "Deedro Edison Company," Robert Pearson, chairman of "Indiana Mobil Oil Company," Gustav Egloff, director of the "World Oil Production" research department, Paul Fund, deputy manager of "Gulf Research and Development Company," and Tonnett Carbender, deputy manager of "Remington Arms Company."

　　All these big capitalists are mainly the heads of industrial groups belonging to the Morgan, Rockefeller, DuPont, Mellon, and other Konzerns. These Konzerns have embezzled most of the hundreds of billions of property spent by the government to produce atomic weapons and other weapons into their own pockets.

　　The representatives of the financial oligarchy have completely subordinated the main links of the American state organs to themselves and made this organ serve their own greedy interests. Therefore, it is not surprising that American diplomacy, represented by the likes of Acheson, Austin, and Dulles – these servants of monopoly capital dedicated to a mad arms race – tore up any proposals to ban atomic weapons and tore up any proposals to set up effective international control of atomic energy.

　　"…nowhere is the power of capital, the power of a handful of billionaires, as brutal and as openly corrupt as in America," this sentence said by Lenin more than thirty years ago still has special power now.

　　The concentration of American economic power in the hands of a handful of billionaires gives this handful unlimited power in all aspects of domestic economic and political life. The combination of financial oligarchy and state organs has become more extensive after the war.

　　The American billionaires are still not satisfied with the fact that the leaders of the political parties – the Democratic Party and the Republican Party – represent them in the government and serve their interests; they want to directly control all leading positions in the state power organs.

　　A statement made a few years ago by Welch, a well-known representative of Wall Street and one of the leaders of "New Jersey Mobil Oil," is a very prominent example in this regard. Welch stated frankly at the National Foreign Trade Council: "American private entrepreneurs must either actively save their position in the world, or passively witness their own funeral..." Welch emphasized that "private entrepreneurs should start to implement their own foreign policy, starting with the most important thing – sending their own people to the government."

　　According to the evidence in Thomas Burke's book "American Imperialism and the Marshall Plan," there were a total of fifty bankers, financiers, and industrialists appointed to leading positions in the American government at the beginning of 1948, and about thirty army and navy generals and other senior military personnel.

　　The National Association of Manufacturers, which owns about 16,000 large capital enterprises and controls 60 billion US dollars, is the main organization used by Wall Street to determine the institutions and policies of the American government. In the leading organs of this association – the so-called "Committee of Twelve" – everything is completely decided by the representatives of the main groups belonging to American monopoly capital such as Morgan, Rockefeller, Mellon, and DuPont. The National Association of Manufacturers is considered to be above the government, as Thomas Burke pointed out in his book, "Any important political strategy implemented by the American government originates from here or is agreed upon with it."

　　Acheson, Harriman, Dulles, Austin, Johnson, Symington, McCloy, and other most famous American politicians were all sent by the National Association of Manufacturers to the Truman government. The most prominent example is Harriman. Harriman is one of the largest wealthy people in the United States and is the manager of "Brown Brothers Harriman" bank company, which has connections with many American railways, shipbuilding, mining, and aviation industries. As is well known, Harriman was active in diplomatic circles during the war. After the war, he was appointed as the Secretary of Commerce and later as the special plenipotentiary ambassador of the American government stationed in Europe to implement the Marshall Plan; now he has accepted a new senior position: Truman's special assistant and advisor.

　　American Secretary of State Acheson has close ties with the largest monopoly capitalists. He is the owner of the famous American law firm "Covington, Darlinger, Acheson Company," which serves the Morgan, Rockefeller, and DuPont consortia. Dulles, one of the most reactionary elements and war-mongers, who recently became an advisor to the American Secretary of State, leads the New York law firm "Sullivan & Cromwell," which represents the interests of many of the largest banking groups.

　　The current American Secretary of Defense, Johnson, actually joined the government as the manager of "United Aircraft Manufacturing Company." During the war, this company received a large number of government orders worth 5 billion US dollars. Most of it fell into the company's vault as pure profit.

　　Symington, who recently left the position of Secretary of the Air Force, is now the chairman of the National Security Resources Board. During the war, he was the manager of "Emerson Electric Company," which produced radio and electrical materials. According to American newspaper materials, Symington's company received hundreds of millions of dollars in net profit due to government military orders.

　　The official resume of the current American High Commissioner to West Germany, McCloy, is also extremely interesting. McCloy belongs to the American business group through which Wall Street realizes its economic aggression under the cover of the "international flag."

　　McCloy, who served as an advisor to Rockefeller's "Chase Bank," was appointed as the president of the so-called "International Bank for Reconstruction and Development." This bank is one of the main tools used by Wall Street to financially and economically enslave other countries. Now, McCloy, serving as the American High Commissioner, represents the American monopoly capitalists in West Germany and implements a program to colonize West Germany and turn it into an American base for aggression in Europe.

　　All those who hold diplomatic positions abroad are connected to American monopoly capital groups through various clues. For example, the American Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Douglas, is the chairman of "Mutual Life Insurance Company," one of the largest insurance companies in the United States. The former American Ambassador to Greece, Grady – the instigator and organizer of the Greek civil war and intervention – is now the American Ambassador to Iran, and he was the chairman of "American President Lines" for a long time.

　　Now, when the entire policy of the United States is preparing for a new world war, the direct control of monopoly capital over domestic military organs and armed forces is of particular significance. The activities of the Military Committee organized under the Atomic Energy Control Commission can show this situation. The committee is used to realize the connection between the Atomic Energy Commission and the American Department of the Army. The leaders of this committee are especially reliable representatives of the National Association of Manufacturers. In particular, the chairman of the committee for a period of time was the deputy manager of "Remington Arms Company," which specializes in the production of military equipment.

　　American monopoly capitalists are also widely acting as executors of their own aggressive plans and militaristic policies. American journalist Steele pointed out the powerful influence of the military group in Congress when he wrote: "The Department of the Army now completely controls Congress. Now Congress is purely a supplement to the Department of the Army, which is used as a civilized facade."

　　It has become extremely obvious in these facts that the American state power organs and armed forces are fully and comprehensively subordinate to a handful of large monopoly capitalists. American monopoly capitalists, harboring the delusion of creating an American world colonial empire, are driving the Truman government's policies down the road of military adventures and down the road of instigating a new world war.

　　The direct aggression adopted by American imperialism against Korea and China is a component of this evil policy.

　　The war in Korea is being used by the financial tycoons as an excuse to strengthen the arms race and cause a new military "boom" in the United States. Wall Street industrialists are expecting new hundreds of billions in profits. The speeches of politicians published in the American reactionary press are even more often clamoring for further militarization of the national economy, demanding that a large number of industrial sectors – such as steel, aluminum, and chemical industries – be transferred to the military track.

　　The Truman government cannot wait long to realize these demands. A few days ago, the American president submitted a supplementary military appropriation of nearly 10 billion US dollars to Congress and announced the implementation of many military programs. As a result, new floods of dollars will flow into the gold vaults of American "death factory owners" – bankers and manufacturers.

　　American big capitalists and their agents in the government are preparing to plunge the American people and the world into a new war for their own greedy interests. However, on the road to the realization of their evil plans, there is the international movement to defend peace. This movement is growing, consolidating, and adhering to the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. This camp is headed by the great fortress of world peace – the Soviet Union.

### 消息报答读者问  帝国主义的侵略政策对谁有利？

专栏：

　　消息报答读者问
    帝国主义的侵略政策对谁有利？
    “消息报”的读者伊万诺夫（高尔基城）要求说明：华尔街的大资本家们在美国政府的侵略政策中，起着怎样的作用？
    “消息报”刊载布兰诺夫的答复如下：
    华尔街的大资本家是侵略政策的鼓舞者。杜鲁门政府为了美国独占资本家的利益，正在实现着这个侵略政策。
    不久以前，“华尔街日报”公布了关于三百个工业大资本家的会议报道。这次会议是由全国军备委员会——使美国经济军国主义化的总司令部——发起召集的。全国军备委员会的头子霍华德在会上作了长篇演说。他说明新的战争对于庞大的“事业”，即对于银行和工业投机，有着如何的需要。霍华德又宣布了一项引得听众异常满意的事实：在这“非常情况”的前六个月时期内，陆、海军部和空军部给与美国工业四百一十亿美元的订货单。
    美元财阀的典型代表霍华德的讲演已经最好地证明：战争对于大资本家来说，是最适合的致富的泉源。如所周知，第二次世界大战给美国的工业及财团带来了如何巨大的利润。
    在战前的一九三九年，美国股票公司的利润为六十四亿美元。在战争期间，利润增加了许多倍。一九四二年。美国五个股份公司的总利润，已超过了一九三六——一九三九年每年平均利润的一百倍以上，另有三十四个公司——超过十倍以上，另有四十八个公司——则超过三倍以上。一九四三年一年，美国财阀就获利二百四十亿美元。美国工业集团在战争年代中所获得的纯利的总数目，在五百三十亿美元以上。
    美国政府在战后时期的内外政策——扩张和侵略政策——，完全是为美国独占资本的利益服务的。
    华尔街的大资本家们在剧烈的军备竞赛中、在燃起的军事“景气”声中在准备并挑拨新战争以确定美国的世界霸权中，为美国紧迫的经济危机找到了出路。这种战争的远景，对于摩根、洛克菲勒、梅隆、杜邦及其他金元王子之流来说，是异常诱人的，因为它约许给他们新的巨大财富。杜鲁门政府近几年来所实行的“冷战”政策和军备竞赛，已使美国资本家的财产扩大了数百亿美元。据合众社公布的消息说，五十六个工业集团的资产（财产、有价证券等）的总价值，在两年之中（从一九四七至一九四九年），自一千零三十五亿扩大到一千三百五十亿美元。主要属于摩根和洛克菲勒集团的六个股份公司的资产价值，在这两年当中即扩充了八十五亿美元。美国独占资本家这种丰富的美元收获，就是杜鲁门政府所执行的侵略政策的结果。
    我们看一下原子能管制委员会及其所组织的各种机关团体的活动，就能够明白站在美国政府幕后，操纵它的一切活动的力量有多么大了。
    委员会的委员是华尔街实际的全权代理人。华尔街通过这些人把对原子能生产的管制权攫取到自己手里，并使政府确定适合于自己利益的政策。
    华尔街对杜鲁门政府政策的统治，在一九四七年的原子问题上特别加强了，当时在委员会之下组织了所谓“工业咨询团”。不久以前，据美国工会的联合通讯社报道，参加这个团体的都是代表美国最大的工业及财团利益的人们。其中有“狄德罗爱迭孙公司”总经理詹姆斯·派克，“印第安那美孚油公司”董事长劳伯特·皮尔逊，“世界油产”研究部主任古斯塔夫爱格洛夫，“加尔夫研究与发展公司”副经理波尔·封德，“腊明登军器公司”副经理童奈特·卡本德等。
    所有这些大资本家主要是属于摩根、洛克菲勒、杜邦、梅隆等康采恩的工业集团的首脑。这些康采恩把政府所支出的用以生产原子武器及其他武器的数百亿财产大部分都窃取到自己的腰包里。
    财政寡头的代表们，使美国国家机关的主要环节完全从属于自己，并使这个机关为自己贪婪的利益而服务。因之，以艾奇逊、奥斯汀、杜勒斯之流——这些致力于疯狂进行军备竞赛的独占资本的执事们——为代表的美国外交，撕毁了任何禁止原子武器的提议，撕毁了任何设置原子能有效的国际管制的提议，是毫不足怪的。
    “……世界上资本的政权，一小撮亿万富翁的政权，在任何地方都没有像在美国这样的粗暴，这样公开的行贿”，三十多年以前列宁所说的这句话，现在仍然具有特殊的力量。
    美国的经济威力集中在一小撮亿万富翁的手里，使得这一小撮人在国内经济生活及政治生活各方面具有无限的权能。财政寡头和国家机关的结合，战后具有更加广大的性质了。
    美国的亿万富翁，对于政党的领袖们——民主党和共和党——在政府中代表他们并为他们的利益服务这件事，仍然没有感到满足；他们要把国家政权机关中的一切领导地位直接掌握到自己的手里。
    几年前，华尔街著名的代表“新泽西美孚煤油”公司的领导人之一维尔奇的声明，是在这方面的一个很显著的例子。维尔奇在对外贸易全国委员会上率直地声明说：“美国的私有企业家要么应该积极挽救自己在全世界的地位，要么，就被动的作自己葬礼的目击者……”维尔奇强调指出：“私人企业家应该开始实行自己的对外政策，要从最重要的——派遣自己的人到政府中去来着手。”
    依照汤姆斯·贝尔克所著《美国帝国主义及马歇尔计划》一书中的证据，一九四八年初所任命的在美国政府中担任领导地位的，共有银行家、财政家及工业家五十人，陆海军将军及其他高级军人约三十人。
    拥有大约一万六千个庞大资本的企业、控制六百亿美元的全国制造商协会，是华尔街用以确定美国政府的机构及政策的主要组织。在这个协会的领导机关——所谓“十二人委员会”中，一切事情完全由美国独占资本如摩根、洛克菲勒、梅隆、杜邦等所属的主要集团的代表来决定。全国制造商协会被认为是超越政府的，正如汤姆斯·贝尔克在其书中指出，“美国政府所施行的任何重要政治方策，都是从此处出发或和它取得协议的”。
    艾奇逊、哈里曼、杜勒斯、奥斯汀、詹森、薛明顿、麦克洛埃及其他美国最著名的政治家们，都是全国制造商协会派遣到杜鲁门政府中的。最显著的例子就是哈里曼。哈里曼是美国最大的富翁之一，是“布朗兄弟哈里曼”银行公司的经理，这个公司与美国许多铁路、造船、矿业和航空业都有联系。如所周知，哈里曼在战争时期活跃于外交界。战后他被委任为商务部长，后任美国政府驻欧执行马歇尔计划的特命全权大使；现在他又接受了一个新的高级职位：杜鲁门的专门助手和顾问。
    美国国务卿艾奇逊与最大的独占资本家们有着密切联系。他是美国著名的法律事务所“科文顿、达林格、艾奇逊公司”的主人，这个公司是服务于摩根、洛克菲勒和杜邦财团的。极端反动分子及战争贩子之一，不久以前做了美国国务卿顾问的杜勒斯，领导着纽约“苏立文·克伦威尔”律师事务所，这个事务所是代表许多最大的银行集团的利益的。
    美国现任国防部长詹森，实际上是作为“联合飞机制造公司”经理而加入政府的。大战期间，这个公司接到了政府的大批订货价值五十亿美元。其中绝大部分作为纯利落到该公司的保险柜中去了。
    不久以前，离开空军部长职位的薛明顿，现任全国安全资源局主席。他在大战期间本是生产着无线电及电料器材的“爱默逊电气公司”的经理。据美国报纸的材料，薛明顿的公司由于政府的军事订货而得到的纯利，有数亿美元之多。
    美国现任驻西德高级专员麦克洛埃的官历也是异常有趣的。麦克洛埃是属于美国商业家集团的，华尔街借这一集团来实现其“国际旗帜”掩护下的经济侵略。
    作着洛克菲勒“大通银行”顾问的麦克洛埃，曾被任命为所谓“国际复兴开发银行”的总裁。这个银行是华尔街用以在财政上和经济上奴役其他国家的主要工具之一。现在，这个做着美国高级专员的麦克洛埃，在西德代表了美国的独占资本家，实现一种使西德殖民地化及将它变为美国在欧洲的侵略基地的纲领。
    凡在国外担任着外交职位的人们，全都以各种各样的线索与美国独占资本集团联系着。例如，美国驻英大使道格拉斯是美国一个最大的保险公司“互助人寿保险公司”的董事长。美国前任驻希大使格兰第——希腊内战及干涉的鼓舞者及组织者——现任美国驻伊朗的大使，他有很长时期是“美国总统轮船公司”的董事长等。
    现在，当美国全部政策都在准备新的世界战争的时候，独占资本对国内军事机关及武装力量的直接控制，更具有特殊的意义。原子能管制委员会下所组织的军事委员会的活动，即可表示出这种情形。该委员会是被用以实现原子能委员会与美国陆军部之间的联系的。这个委员会的领导人是全国制造商协会的特别可靠的代表们。特别是该委员会有一个时期的主席是“腊明登军器公司”的副经理，这个公司是专门生产军事器材的。
    美国独占资本家们，同时广泛地做着自己侵略计划及黩武政策的执行者。美国记者斯蒂尔指出国会中军事集团的有力影响时写道：“陆军部现在完全控制着国会。现在国会纯粹是当作文明表饰的陆军部的补充物。”
    美国的国家政权机关和武装力量，充分而且全面地服从于一小撮大独占资本家，在这些事实中已经表现得异常明显。怀有创造美国世界殖民帝国妄想的美国独占资本家们，驱使杜鲁门政府的政策走上军事冒险的道路，走上挑拨新世界战争的道路了。
    美帝国主义对朝鲜和中国所采取的直接侵略，就是这个罪恶政策的组成部分。
    朝鲜的战争被金元财阀们利用为加强军备竞赛和在美国引起新的军事“景气”的借口。华尔街的实业家们期待着新的数百亿利润。美国反动报刊上所刊登的政治家的演说更时常叫嚣着要求国家经济进一步军事化，要求把大量工业部门——钢、铝和化学等工业——转入了军事轨道。
    杜鲁门政府不能长期地等候这些要求的实现。几天以前，美国总统向议会就提出了补充约近一百亿美元的军事拨款，并宣布实行许多军事方案。其结果是新的美元洪流将要流入美国的“死亡工厂主”——银行家及制造商——的金柜中去。
    美国的大资本家巨头及其在政府中的代理人们，为了自己贪婪的利益而准备将美国人民和全世界投入新战争。但是，在他们这种罪恶计划实现的道路上，却有国际拥护和平运动。这个运动在增长着、巩固着、坚守着强大的和平、民主与社会主义的阵营。这个阵营是以世界和平的伟大堡垒——苏联为首的。
