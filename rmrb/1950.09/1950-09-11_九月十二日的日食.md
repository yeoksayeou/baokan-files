　　The Solar Eclipse on September 12th
　　Mass Astronomy Society
　　There are two solar eclipses this year. One is the annular eclipse on March 18th, which is not visible in China. The other is the total solar eclipse on September 12th. The path of totality starts near the Arctic, passes through the northeastern corner of Asia, exits into the Bering Sea, and then into the Pacific Ocean. North China and Northeast China are far from the path of totality and can only see a partial eclipse, and the part of the sun covered by the eclipse will not be very large.
　　Such a grand and magnificent astronomical phenomenon as a solar eclipse is capable of amazing people. Before the development of science, when humanity did not understand the principle of solar eclipses, people were terrified by this phenomenon. They beat gongs, set off firecrackers, prayed to gods, and worshipped Buddha, hoping to scare away the "celestial dog." This, of course, had no effect. The oldest record of a solar eclipse is found in the Book of Documents of China. That total solar eclipse occurred in 2137 BC. People were able to predict the occurrence of solar eclipses around 500-600 BC. It is said that Greek astronomers had this knowledge at that time. In fact, ancient Chinese astronomers probably knew it even earlier. At that time, Chinese astronomers were officials in charge of celestial phenomena for the emperor. The emperor compared the sun to his own symbol. Therefore, before a solar eclipse occurred, this official had to calculate it, otherwise, he would face the fate of being beheaded.
　　The cause of solar and lunar eclipses is due to the changing mutual positions of the sun, the earth, and the moon. The earth revolves around the sun, and the moon revolves around the earth. Because the earth and the moon cannot emit light themselves and are illuminated by the sun, their sides facing away from the sun both cast a long, conical shadow. Inside the shadow, the sun cannot be seen. Therefore, when the moon moves between the earth and the sun, and the three are in a straight line, the moon's shadow covers the earth. In the area swept by the shadow, people cannot see the sun, and a solar eclipse occurs. Similarly, if the moon moves behind the earth, that is, the earth moves between the sun and the moon, and the sun's light is blocked by the earth and cannot reach the moon, then a lunar eclipse occurs. Since the moon revolves around the earth approximately once a month, it would seem that a lunar eclipse should occur every full moon (around the 15th day of the lunar month), and a solar eclipse should occur every new moon (the first day of the lunar month). However, this is not the case. Because the orbital plane of the earth's revolution around the sun and the orbital plane of the moon's revolution around the earth, also known as the ecliptic plane and the lunar orbit plane, are not the same (these two planes have an angle of intersection of more than five degrees), although the moon and the earth have a chance to move to the middle once a month, the three are not necessarily in a straight line. Therefore, solar and lunar eclipses do not necessarily occur every month.
　　How do total solar eclipses, partial solar eclipses, or annular solar eclipses occur? As mentioned earlier, sunlight cannot reach the ground at all inside the conical lunar shadow. In the area covered by this completely dark shadow, a total solar eclipse can be seen. This kind of shadow is called the umbra. The lunar shadow usually refers to this kind of shadow. It becomes narrower the further it is from the moon. Surrounding the umbra is another kind of shadow called the penumbra, which is semi-bright and semi-dark. It becomes wider the further it is from the moon. In this penumbra, some sunlight can reach. In places covered by this penumbra, only a portion of the sun's surface can be seen obscured by the moon, forming an arc-shaped gap. This situation is called a partial solar eclipse. A solar eclipse always begins as a partial eclipse because the penumbra is always outside the umbra. Sometimes only the moon's penumbra can reach the ground. In this case, only a partial solar eclipse can occur, and a total solar eclipse will not occur. As for annular eclipses, that is a situation where the moon is farther away from the earth, and its umbra cannot reach the ground. In this case, people in this range see the moon only obscuring the central part of the sun's disk, leaving the outer edge of the sun's disk, like a large golden bracelet hanging high in the sky, with rays of light in all directions, which is extremely beautiful. The annular solar eclipse on May 9, 1948, and the annular solar eclipse on March 18 this year were both such solar eclipses.
　　The entire process of a total solar eclipse can be divided into five stages: first contact, totality, maximum eclipse, third contact, and fourth contact. The beginning of the solar eclipse is called first contact. When the sun begins to be completely obscured, which is also the beginning of the total solar eclipse, is called totality. The most severe obscuration, which is when the shadow cone is closest to the center of the sun, is called the maximum eclipse. The end of the total solar eclipse is the time of third contact. Finally, the stage when the lunar shadow completely leaves the sun's disk is called "fourth contact," which is when the sun's surface begins to completely restore its disk shape. At this time, the solar eclipse is complete. As for partial eclipses, there are only three stages: first contact, maximum eclipse, and fourth contact. According to calculations, for the solar eclipse on September 12th this year, the first contact in Beijing is at 10:30:18; fourth contact, 11:25:12. In Shenyang, first contact is at 10:16:36; fourth contact, 11:56:24. In Jiamusi, first contact is at 10:05:06; fourth contact, 12:12:42. In Harbin, first contact is at 10:05:48; fourth contact, 12:53. In Andong, first contact is at 10:22:36; fourth contact, 11:58:54.
　　The degree to which the sun's disk is obscured at a certain location during a solar eclipse is called the magnitude. If the magnitude of a total eclipse is equal to or greater than one, the magnitude of a partial eclipse must be less than one. For example, this time, a partial eclipse with a magnitude of about 0.3 can be seen in various parts of Northeast China, while it will be less than 0.1 in various parts of North China.
　　Why is the opportunity to see a total solar eclipse at the same location so rare? We know that the longest lunar shadow is only 380,000 kilometers, while the average distance between the moon and the earth is 384,000 kilometers. Therefore, the lunar shadow usually cannot reach the ground. However, when the moon is closest to the earth, it is only 350,000 kilometers. In this case, the lunar shadow can reach the ground, and a total solar eclipse can be seen in the area covered by the lunar shadow. This opportunity is, of course, very rare. At the same time, because the cross-section of the lunar shadow on the ground is very small, with a maximum diameter of only 260 kilometers, usually only about 40 kilometers, it is only a very small area on the ground. On average, in a certain place, there is only one chance to see a total solar eclipse every 360 years. As for the range where a partial solar eclipse can be seen, it is much larger. The area covered by the penumbra is usually 8,500 kilometers wide, and at most can cover one-fourth of the total area of the Earth's surface. Therefore, the opportunity to see a partial solar eclipse is far greater than that of a total solar eclipse. On average, there are about four solar and lunar eclipses each year. The most in a year is seven, including five solar eclipses and two lunar eclipses, or four solar eclipses and three lunar eclipses. Just in terms of solar eclipses, there can be as many as five in a year, but at least two. Even so, there are many people who live in one place for their entire lives and never see a total solar eclipse.
　　The duration of a total solar eclipse is at most seven minutes, usually only two or three minutes. Scientists can use this valuable time to do a lot of research. They can use this opportunity to precisely measure the relative positions of the sun, moon, and earth to investigate their movements and measure the shape of the earth. They can also take photographs of the sky near the sun during the total eclipse to confirm the Einstein effect mentioned in science. A total solar eclipse is also the best opportunity to study the structure of the sun's atmosphere. In addition, various studies can be conducted on changes in the high-altitude ionosphere and various meteorological conditions at that time.

　　九月十二日的日食
    大众天文社
    今年有两次日食，一次是三月十八日的日环食，在我国境内看不见，另外就是这一次九月十二日的日全食了。这次全食带，从北极附近起，经过亚洲的东北角，出伯令海，到太平洋，我国华北和东北一带离全食带很远，只能看到偏食，而且看见日面被食的部分也不很多。
    像日食这样伟大壮丽的天象，是能够使人惊奇的。在科学没有发达以前，人类对于日食的原理还不明白的时候，人们对这样现象发生恐怖。打锣、放炮、求神、拜佛，想吓走“天狗”，这当然没有什么作用。最古的关于日食的记载，以我国书经上所记的为最早。那一次日全食发生在公元前两千一百三十七年。人们能够预算日食的发生，是在公元前五六百年的时候。据说，那时希腊的天文学家有这种知识。其实，我国古代的天文学家恐怕知道得还早些。那时候我国的天文学家，就是为皇帝掌管天象的官员。皇帝把太阳比为自己的象征，因此，在日食还没发生以前，这位官员就要推算出来，否则他就要遭遇到杀头的命运。
    日月食的原因，是由于太阳、地球、月亮三个天体的相互位置变动而产生的。地球是绕着太阳转动的，月亮又是绕着地球转动的。因为地球和月亮都不能自己发光，是靠太阳的光照耀着它们，所以它们背着太阳的一面，都拖着一条很长的圆锥形的黑影，在影子里面是看不见太阳的。因此，当月亮走到地球和太阳的中间，而且三者在一条直线上的时候，月亮的影子便罩到地球上。在影子扫过的地区，人们就看不见太阳，就成了日食的现象。同样，假使月亮走到地球的后面，也就是地球走到了太阳和月亮的中间，太阳的光被地球挡住不能射到月亮上，这样，便发生月食的现象。由于月亮差不多每月绕地球转一周，照这样看来，应该在每月的望日（就是阴历每月十五前后），必定有月食发生，每月朔日（就是阴历每月初一）必定有日食发生。事实上不然，由于地球绕太阳运动的轨道面和月亮绕地球运动的轨道面，也叫做黄道面和白道面并不一致（这两个平面有五度多的交角），所以月亮和地球虽然每月有一次走到中间去的机会，但它们三者未必恰好在一条直线上，因此便不一定每月都有日食和月食发生了。
    怎样才会发生日全食，日偏食或日环食呢？前面说过，在那条圆锥形的月影内，太阳光完全不能射到地面上，在这条完全黑暗的影子盖着的地方，就可以看到日全食。这种影子叫做本影，通常说到的月影就是指的这一种，它是离月球越远越窄的。包围本影的还有一种影子叫做半影，它是半明半暗的，离月亮越远越宽。在这种半影里，阳光有一部分能够射到。地面上被这种半影遮盖住的地方，可以看见太阳的表面只有一部分被月球遮住，形成一个弧形的缺口。这种情形叫做日偏食。日食开始的时候总是偏食，这是因为半影总是在本影外面的原故。有时只有月球的半影能接触地面，那么，在这种情形下，便只能发生日偏食，而不会发生日全食了。至于日环食呢，那是这样的一种情形：假使月球离地较远，它的本影不能达到地面上，那么，地面上在这个范围内的人，看见月球只遮住太阳圆面的中部，剩下太阳圆面的外围，好像一只大金手镯高挂在天空上，霞光万道，美丽极了。一九四八年五月九日的日环食和今年三月十八日的日环食都是这种日食。
    日全食的全部过程，可以分为初亏、食既、食甚、生光和复圆五个阶段。日食开始的时候叫做初亏。太阳开始完全被掩没也就是日全食开始的时候，叫做食既。被食得最厉害也就是影锥最近太阳中心的时候，叫做食甚。日全食终了，就是生光的时候。最后，月影完全离开了太阳圆面这个阶段叫做“复圆”，就是太阳表面开始完全恢复了圆盘形状。这时日食才完毕了。至于偏食，那就只有初亏、食甚和复圆三个阶段。根据计算，今年九月十二日的日食，在北京初亏是十点三十分十八秒；复圆，十一点二十五分十二秒，沈阳初亏，十点十六分三十六秒；复圆，十一点五十六分二十四秒。佳木斯初亏，十点五分六秒；复圆，十二点十二分四十二秒。哈尔滨初亏，十点五分四十八秒；复圆，十二点五十三分。安东初亏，十点二十二分三十六秒；复圆，十一点五十八分五十四秒。
    在一定地点看见日食时，日面被掩得最厉害的程度，叫做食分。如果全食的食分等于一或大于一，偏食的食分就一定小于一了。例如，这次在我国东北各地可以看到食分为十分之三左右的偏食，华北各地就不到十分之一了。
    为什么在同一地点能看到日全食的机会很少呢！我们知道：月影最长的时候不过三十八万公里，而月亮和地球的平均距离是三十八万四千公里，所以月影通常是不能达到地面的，可是当月亮离地球最近的时候，只有三十五万公里，在这种情形之下，月影才可以达到地面在被月影遮盖着的地方，才可以看到日全食。这种机会当然是很少的。同时由于月影在地面上截口很小，直径最多不过二百六十公里，通常只有四十公里左右，在地面上仅是很小的范围，平均在一定的地方，每三百六十年才有一次看见日全食的机会。至于能看见日偏食的范围，那就很多了。半影盖着的地方通常有八千五百公里宽，最多时可以遮住地球表面总面积的四分之一，所以看见日偏食的机会，远比日全食为多。平均来说，每年大约有四次日月食，一年最多的有七次，其中有五次日食两次月食，或者是四次日食三次月食。单就日食来说，最多时一年有五次，但是最少也有两次。虽然这样。老住在一个地方不动的人，一生也看不见一次日全食的还多得很呢。
    日全食经过的时间最多不过七分钟，通常不过两三分钟。科学家利用这段宝贵的时间，可以做很多研究工作。利用这个机会，他们可以精密测定日、月、地球的相对位置，来考察它们的运动情形和测量地球的形状。又可以作全食时太阳附近天空的摄影，以证实科学上所说的爱因斯坦效应。日全食时也是研究太阳大气层构造的最好机会。此外，在那时也可以作高空电离层和各种气象情况变化的种种研究。
