Xinhua News Agency, 7th:

　　Representative figures from religious circles in Beijing, including the Director of the Buddhist Study Group, Juzan; the Dean of the School of Religion at Yenching University, Zhao Zichen (Christian); Beijing University Professor Ma Jian (Muslim); the General Secretary of the Beijing Christian Association, Wang Zizhong; Bishop Jiang Changchuan of the Christian Methodist Church; the Chairman of the Beijing Buddhist Lay Association, Zhou Shujia; and Buddhist layman Ye Gongchuo, have issued a declaration calling on followers of all religions to sign a petition opposing American aggression against Taiwan and Korea, and the crimes of American aircraft invading our airspace and killing and wounding our compatriots. Within three days of the declaration's issuance, 1,181 people had signed it. The declaration stated: "We, the religious people of Beijing, including followers of Buddhism, Christianity, Catholicism, and Islam, resolutely oppose American imperialism's armed aggression against Taiwan and Korea; especially the heinous acts of American aircraft indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean residents and invading our airspace to slaughter our compatriots." The declaration continued: "Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory, and the liberation of Taiwan is the unanimous demand of the entire Chinese people, which is just as important as the Korean people's struggle for the unification and freedom of their motherland. We maintain that Asian problems should be solved by the Asian people themselves, and American imperialists should not be allowed to interfere. We believe that the Asian people and the people of all nations around the world will surely be able to crush all the conspiracies and tricks of the American imperialists. We will take practical actions to provide more effective support until the collapse of the American imperialist bloc and the world can maintain lasting peace."
