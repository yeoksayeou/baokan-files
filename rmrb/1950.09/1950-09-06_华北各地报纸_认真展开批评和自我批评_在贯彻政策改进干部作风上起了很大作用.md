Xinhua News Agency, September 4th: Over the past few months, newspapers led by the Chinese Communist Party in various provinces and cities of North China have achieved considerable success in implementing the CCP Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications."

Since April of this year, there has been a significant increase in critical articles in newspapers throughout North China. For example, the Shanxi Daily published eleven critical articles in March, increasing to eighty-four in July. The Hebei Daily published a total of two hundred and ninety-two critical articles over three months, accounting for one-seventh of the critical articles received. The Chahar Daily received three hundred and sixteen pieces of criticism and suggestions in June and July, publishing one hundred and sixteen of them. The number of critical articles published in the Pingyuan and Suiyuan newspapers has also increased.

Most local newspapers publish important critical articles in prominent positions and are able to grasp the main issues, organize commentaries, or add editor's notes. For example, of the eighty-one critical articles published by the Shanxi Daily in May, twelve were used as headline news, and most of the others were published in prominent positions; editorials or short comments were written for six of them, and editor's notes were added to thirty-one. After publishing critical articles, local newspapers notify the criticized organizations or individuals and urge them to make timely self-examination. For more significant events, continuous reports are conducted to ensure that they have a beginning and an end, powerfully promoting the improvement of local practical work and making the connection between newspapers and the masses of people closer.

The criticized organizations and cadres generally conduct serious self-examination, deal with problems in a timely manner, formulate improvement measures, and announce them in the newspapers. Therefore, these criticisms have played a significant role in improving practical work, implementing the policies of the People's Government and the Communist Party, and improving the style of cadres. For example, Zeng Guangfu, a labor hero and worker-peasant correspondent of the Pingyuan Daily in Shen County, suggested through the newspaper that the county dig smooth water ditches. After this suggestion was implemented, it has prevented two thousand seven hundred acres of low-lying land from being flooded. Furthermore, the regulations of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government on providing relief to unemployed workers and unemployed intellectuals have absorbed many opinions from workers and citizens in the Tianjin Daily and have been revised and supplemented. After the Hebei Daily exposed the incident of Zhongnong Mi Juchen's land in Liang Village, Anxin County, being infringed upon, the Baoding Administrative Office and the Baoding Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately sent personnel to the village to inspect and correct the situation, punish cadres who directly violated policies and laws, and issue a notice to all subordinate counties to conduct inspections based on the Liang Village incident, calling on cadres to study the news and editorials. This criticism and inspection promoted other prefectures and counties in the province to conduct inspections automatically and solve similar land problems. Due to this serious criticism and responsible self-examination, the newspapers have further strengthened their ties with the masses. For example, the Hebei Daily now has an average of more than ten readers coming to the newspaper office every day to talk face-to-face and ask for help in solving problems, which shows that the newspaper has gained considerable prestige among the people after effectively launching criticism.

The criticism and self-criticism work of local newspapers has been carried out under the resolute implementation of the CCP Central Committee's decision by the local People's Governments and the leading organs of the Communist Party. However, some local organizations of the People's Governments and the Communist Party are not good at using it as a weapon to promote work. Therefore, the current criticism and self-criticism work still shows great passivity and has not truly become a conscious mass movement. Local newspapers criticize lower-level organs more and upper-level organs less; more criticisms are raised by government and organ staff, and relatively few criticisms are raised by the masses; there are more critical articles and fewer self-critical articles. For example, in the Shanxi Daily's critical articles in May and June, a total of forty-eight critical articles were written by leading organs, a total of fifty-eight articles were written by various organs and cadres criticizing each other, and only thirty-seven critical articles came from the people. Some organs still cannot promptly examine and respond to criticisms in the newspapers; some organs adopt an attitude of resistance or indifference to newspaper criticisms; some responsible cadres still use "taking into account the prestige of the government" and "taking care of the emotions of cadres" as excuses and are unwilling to conduct public criticism and self-examination in the newspapers; some cadres still have fears of criticism. In addition, newspapers still have the problem of not being realistic enough when criticizing shortcomings in practical work. Currently, various newspapers have separately summarized the experience of launching criticism and self-criticism work. They generally believe that in order to continue to implement the decision of the CCP Central Committee in the future, they must be good at selecting major events with general educational significance on the one hand, and launch criticism; on the other hand, they must also conduct education among newspaper editors and reporters, requiring them to better grasp the principles of seeking truth from facts and curing diseases to save people, and overcome certain tendencies of criticizing for the sake of criticism. And appropriately pay attention to commending models, so that criticism and self-criticism become a conscious mass movement.

### 华北各地报纸　认真展开批评和自我批评　在贯彻政策改进干部作风上起了很大作用

　　华北各地报纸
    认真展开批评和自我批评
    在贯彻政策改进干部作风上起了很大作用
    【新华社四日讯】华北各省、市中国共产党所领导的报纸数月来在执行中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”方面，已获得相当成绩。
    华北各地报纸自今年四月以后批评性的稿件都有显著增加。如山西日报在三月份发表批评性稿件十一篇，到七月份增加到八十四篇。河北日报三个月来共发表批评性稿件二百九十二篇，占收到的批评性稿件七分之一。察哈尔日报六、七月份共收到批评和建议性的稿件三百一十六件，发表了一百一十六件。平原、绥远各报发表的批评性的稿件也有增加。
    各地报纸对重要批评稿件，大部分都刊载在重要地位，并能抓住主要问题，组织评论或加上编者按语。如山西日报五月份发表的八十一篇批评稿件中，作为头条新闻的就有十二篇，其他也多数刊载在显著地位；其中有六篇写了社论或短评，三十一篇加了编者按语。各地报纸在批评性稿件发表后，即通知被批评的机关或个人并督促他们及时检讨。对于较重大事件，则进行了连续报道，使其有始有终，有力地推动了各地实际工作的改进，使报纸和人民群众的联系更加密切。
    被批评的机关和干部，一般都能认真进行检讨，及时处理问题，拟定改进办法，并在报纸上公布。因此，这些批评对于改进实际工作，贯彻人民政府和共产党的政策，以及改进干部作风，都起了很大的作用。如平原日报工农通讯员莘县劳动英雄曾广福，通过报纸建议该县挖顺水沟。这个建议被付之实施以后，已使两千七百亩洼地免遭水灾。又如天津市人民政府救济失业工人和失业知识分子的规定，曾吸取了天津日报上很多工人和市民的意见，作了修正和补充。河北日报揭发安新县梁庄中农米巨臣土地被侵犯的事件后，保定专署和中共保定地委立即派员到该村检查纠正，对直接违犯政策法令的干部予以处分，并通令所属各县根据梁庄事件进行检查，号召干部学习该项新闻和社论。这次的批评和检查，推动了全省其他专区、县也自动进行检查，解决了类似的土地问题。由于这种认真的批评和负责的检讨，报纸已更进一步地密切了与群众的联系。例如，河北日报现在平均每天有十多个读者到报馆来面谈，请求帮助解决问题，这说明该报在有效地展开批评之后已在人民中拥有相当大的威信。
    各地报纸的批评和自我批评工作，是在各地人民政府和共产党的领导机关坚决贯彻中共中央决定的方针之下开展起来的。但各地人民政府和共产党的有些地方组织还不善于把它当作一个推进工作的武器来使用，因此，目前批评和自我批评工作还表现出有很大的被动性，没有真正成为群众性的自觉的运动。各地报纸对下级机关批评多，对上级机关批评少；各政府、机关工作人员提出的批评多，群众提出的批评比较少；批评性的稿件多，自我批评的稿件少。如山西日报五、六月份的批评稿件，各领导机关所写的批评稿件共四十八篇，各机关、干部间相互批评的稿件共五十八篇，来自人民群众的批评稿件只有三十七篇。有的机关对报纸上的批评尚不能及时检讨和答复；有的机关对于报纸的批评采取抵抗或置之不理的态度；有些负责干部还以“顾及政府威信”、“照顾干部情绪”为借口，不愿在报纸上进行公开的批评和自我检讨；部分干部还存在着害怕批评的情绪。此外，报纸方面在对实际工作的缺点进行批评时也还有不够实事求是的毛病。现各报已分别总结开展批评与自我批评工作的经验，一般都认为今后要继续贯彻中共中央的决定，必须一方面善于选择主要的富有一般教育意义的事件，展开批评；另一方面还要在报纸编辑、记者中，进行教育，要求他们能更好地掌握实事求是和治病救人的原则，克服某些为批评而批评的偏向。并适当注意表扬模范，使批评和自我批评成为群众性的自觉运动。
