Ren Zhangyuan, a Model of Water Management on Golden Beach

In early summer this year, Quzhou, Zhejiang, experienced continuous heavy rains, and mountain floods from all directions rushed towards the Qujiang River. The river surface churned with waves, and the water flow was turbulent.

The Qujiang River flows through Yejiacun, where there is a Golden Beach. A flood control project is built on the beach. It protects 178,000 mu of paddy fields and ensures water supply for 140,000 people. However, the ferocious mountain floods destroyed the flood control project. With the paddy fields and water supply facing problems, the broad masses were anxious day and night, yet lacked confidence in repairing this large project. Some backward farmers even resorted to "praying to gods and Buddha, relying on heaven for protection." At this time, Ren Zhangyuan, chairman of the Yejiacun Farmers' Association, said to the masses: "Praying to gods is useless; we can only rely on everyone to mobilize."

At a mass meeting, Ren Zhangyuan asked the attendees:

"Who built the Golden Beach in the past?"

"The big landlords used everyone's money to build it!"

"Was it built well?"

Mentioning the big landlords, the masses became agitated. Some said, "They took kickbacks and were irresponsible!" Others said, "It was up to the big landlords' whims. At most, they'd send some people to throw some stones and fill it in carelessly!" Ren Zhangyuan, grasping the masses' emotions, said, "Good! The Kuomintang and the big landlords made a mess of things. Today, we have turned ourselves over. With the leadership of the People's Government, the Golden Beach will definitely be repaired well, as long as everyone works together!" The masses were mobilized. After receiving the funds needed for the start of construction from the county People's Government, he planned to start work, but there was a lack of timber pilings. On the second day of the fifth lunar month, it was raining heavily, and the mountain roads were flooded. He decided to go to Lingtouzhu, over a hundred li away, to purchase the materials. The timber was procured, and he was anxious to return, but because the water was too high, no boat was willing to sail. Later, he found a boat, but the boatman was still unwilling, so he said, "Even if I, an old man, drown, I won't hold you accountable!" The boatman couldn't resist his stubbornness and carried him from Lingtouzhu. Passing Hengtangkou, the rapids were raging, and the small wooden boat, like a runaway wild horse, rushed wildly with the waves, almost capsizing. Just when the whole village was anxiously waiting for his return, he returned, covered in rain, dragging his tired body, and revealing an excited smile. The whole village rejoiced and cheered for him.

His selfless spirit strengthened the masses' confidence in repairing the dike. By the twentieth day of the sixth lunar month, the dike was successfully completed. The 178,000 mu of paddy fields and the water supply for 140,000 people were secured, laying the foundation for increased production in the four districts of Qu County. In addition, he also mobilized the masses to build the Shishi Weir and the Deping Dike. His exemplary actions and his examples of uniting the masses to advance together are endless. In the spring pest control campaign, after he cleared his own mind, he mobilized 24,588 people, capturing over 700 dan and 2,500 jin of rice leaf roller larvae and 18,563 rice stem borer moths. When formulating production plans, he also told everyone from house to house to combine it with saving to get through the lean season: "The Kuomintang is driven away, and we don't have to draft soldiers anymore, so everyone doesn't have to pay military service fees; the gifts to the landlords' families are unnecessary, and we don't have to spend money on cakes, chicken, meat, or hair; relying on heaven is useless, so why buy incense paper and candles?" Everyone did as he said and safely passed the spring famine. He loves the masses, and the masses also love him. This time he went to Beijing, thousands of people saw him off, and many secretly stuffed snacks into his travel bag.

What force prompted him to become a figure loved by the masses? This is because he saw the Communist Party and raised his class consciousness. His fifty-year journey is full of blood and tears. At the age of three, he and his parents fled famine and begged for food. Soon after, his father died. Before the age of six, he waved a willow branch to graze cattle for others, and was cursed and beaten by the owner all day long. At the age of nine, his mother couldn't bear the torment and left the world after being beaten by a landlord. From then on, he became an orphan, wandering and begging for a living. At the age of twenty-eight, he went to work on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, and at the age of thirty-four, he rented a little land in Quzhou to cultivate. After the liberation of Quzhou, he turned himself over. Ren Zhangyuan, who came from a life of humiliation and suffering, understands who is the savior of the working people.

### 黄金滩上的治水模范任樟元

　　黄金滩上的治水模范任樟元
    今年初夏，浙江的衢州连日大雨，四乡的山洪奔向衢江，江面波涛翻滚，水流湍息。
    衢江流过叶家村，那里有一块黄金滩，滩水筑有一条防洪的工程。它防护着十七万八千亩稻田，保障十四万人口的用水。但凶恶的山洪，冲毁了防洪工程。眼看着稻田和用水要发生问题，广大的群众日夜焦急，对于这庞大的工程，却没有信心去修筑。部分落后的农民还“求神拜佛，靠天保佑”。叶家村农会主席任樟元这时就向群众说：“求神是没有用的，只有靠大家动员起来”。
    在一次群众会上，任樟元问到会的群众：
    “黄金滩过去啥人修？”
    “大财主拿大家的钱来修！”
    “修得好不好？”
    提起大财主，群众激动了。有的说：“他们揩油，不负责！”有的说：“随大财主高兴，顶多派点人丢点石子，马马虎虎填填！”任樟元掌握住群众的情绪，他说：“好！国民党和大财主拆烂污，今天我们翻了身，有人民政府的领导，黄金滩也一定修得好，只要大家一起干！”群众被动员起来了。他从县人民政府领来了开工需用的经费以后，计划动工，但是缺乏桩木。旧历五月初二，天下着大雨，山路都被淹没，他决计上百里路外的岭头渚去采办。木材办好了，急着要回来，因为水太大，没有一条船肯开。后来他找到了一条船，仍不愿开，他说：“假如我老头子淹死了，我也不找你们算账！”船夫敌不过他的执拗，载着他从岭头渚开出，过横塘口，激流汹涌，小木船像脱缰的野马一样，随着波涛狂奔，几乎把木船卷没了。当全村的人正焦急地盼望着他回来的时候，他回来了，带着全身雨水，拖着疲倦的身子，露出兴奋的笑容回来了。全村的人为他庆幸，为他欢呼。
    他的忘我的精神，坚定了群众对修堤的信心。到旧历六月二十日，提防顺利完工。十七万八千亩稻田和十四万人口的用水有了保障，并打下衢县四个区增产的基础。此外，他并动员群众修筑了石室堰和德坪堤。他的模范行动和团结群众一起前进的事例是写不完的。在春季治虫中，他自己打通了思想之后，曾发动了二万四千五百八十八个人，捉获稻苞虫七百余担又二千五百多斤，螟蛾一万八千五百六十三只。在订生产计划时，他又挨户告诉大家要结合节约度荒：“国民党赶跑了，不抽壮丁了，大家不要出壮丁费了；财主家的礼，用不着送了，糕饼、鸡子、毛肉钱不费了；靠天无用，还要买啥香纸蜡烛？”大家都照他的话去做，安度了春荒。他爱群众，群众也爱他。他这次上北京，成千的人为他送行，许多人都偷偷地在他的旅行袋里塞进了点心。
    什么力量促使他成为群众爱戴的人物？这是由于他看见了共产党，提高了阶级觉悟。他五十年的历程，充满了血和眼泪。他三岁跟父母逃荒讨饭，不久父亲死了，不到六岁，他挥着柳条鞭给人家放牛，整天被主人咒骂、毒打。九岁那年，母亲受不了折磨，在被财主一阵毒打以后，离开了人世。从此，他成为孤儿，流浪乞食为生。到二十八岁，跑到浙赣路做工，三十四岁到衢州租种了一点田。衢州解放后，他翻了身。从屈辱和苦难生活中过来的任樟元，他懂得谁是劳动人民的救星。
