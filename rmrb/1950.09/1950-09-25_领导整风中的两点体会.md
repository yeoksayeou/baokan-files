Two Lessons from Leading Rectification
    中共松江省尚志县委会 (CCP Shangzhi County Committee, Songjiang Province)

　　Our county's rectification initially took a detour because of insufficient understanding of the basic spirit of rectification. The main manifestation was in formulating the rectification plan. Instead of starting from an analysis of the county's situation, identifying the main problems in key tasks, and pointing out their causes, as instructed by the Provincial Party Committee, we were simply carrying out rectification and making plans on command. We divided the two major issues of agricultural policy and supply and marketing policy pointed out by the Provincial Party Committee into some smaller issues, and considered this to be the "concretization" of the spirit of rectification. As a result, the rectification had too much content, too many meetings, and the problems were listed equally, lacking focus. The same was true in the inspection of work and the collection of materials. This deviation was quickly corrected under the direct leadership and assistance of the Propaganda Department of the Northeast Bureau and the Provincial Party Committee, and the rectification was brought back on track. We are now studying documents, summarizing work, and organizing materials. In this stage, we have two insights:

    (1) In the rectification process, whether it is inspecting work, collecting materials, or conducting criticism and self-criticism, the county committee leadership must "have a clear idea" of the situation. That is to say, the leadership must propose the main problems in the county's work and propose methods and steps to solve these problems. This "idea" is determined after one's own preliminary analysis of the situation and based on the instructions of the higher authorities. The county committee members must discuss this "idea", consider it repeatedly, and strive to reach a consensus on understanding. Otherwise, a leadership core cannot be formed. With a clear idea and the formation of a leadership core, the county committee can ensure that the leadership is always in a clear-headed position during the rectification. However, this idea is not fixed and immutable. The leadership should not stop listening to others' opinions because of it. On the contrary, it should repeatedly modify, improve, and enrich it during the rectification process.

    (2) There must be a clear purpose in collecting materials and inspecting work, and it must be carried out in a planned and prepared manner. Otherwise, it will be a superficial inspection of work and collection of materials. As a result, a large pile of materials is collected, but the useful ones may not be found. This not only fails to solve the problem, but also leads to confusion, inevitably resulting in a summary of work that lists phenomena without a center and fails to solve the problem. For example, in our current inspection of the supply and marketing problem, we have identified planning as one of the issues. We then look for materials in this area, inspect last year's plans and the extent to which they were completed, inspect this year's grain production, and the supply and marketing department's plans for the fourth quarter of this year and 1951, to see what conditions they are based on and what methods they use to make plans, etc. In addition, when inspecting work and collecting materials, it is necessary to conscientiously study the relevant documents. Only in this way can we analyze the materials and improve our understanding. If the county committee itself does not read the documents, no matter how much it studies the materials, its understanding will always be stuck at its current level. Secondly, because the county committee cannot collect all the materials itself, it is necessary to check the authenticity of a material first in order to understand the truth of the matter.

　　领导整风中的两点体会
    中共松江省尚志县委会
    我县的整风，最初因对整风基本精神了解不够，曾走了弯路。主要表现在制订整风计划时，不是根据省委指示精神，从分析本县情况出发，提出主要工作中的主要问题并指出其症结所在；而是奉命整风，奉命作计划。我们在省委指出的农业政策与供销政策两大问题之下，分出一些小问题，便认为这就是整风精神的“具体化”。因此，整风中内容多，开会多，问题平列，缺乏重点。在检查工作和搜集材料上也是如此。以上偏向经过东北局宣传部和省委的直接领导与帮助，很快的得到纠正，整风才纳入正规。现在我们正在学习文件，总结工作，整理材料。在这一阶段中，有两点体会：
    （一）整风中，无论检查工作，汇集材料，或是展开批评与自我批评，县委领导要“心中有底”，也就是说领导上要提出全县工作中的主要问题，并提出解决这些问题的方法和步骤。这个“底”是经过自己初步分析情况和根据上级的指示来确定的。县委委员对这个“底”要进行讨论，再三考虑，认识上要求得一致。否则，便不能形成领导核心。有了底，县委形成领导核心，才能使整风的领导随时都处于头脑清醒的地位。但这个底不是固定不变的，领导上不能因此而不再倾听别人意见。相反地应该在整风过程中反复不断的修改、提高与充实它。
    （二）在汇集材料和检查工作时，要有明确的目的性。并作到有计划和有准备地去进行。否则便是泛泛的检查工作与搜集材料。结果材料一大堆，有用的却不一定找得到，这样不但不能解决问题，反而会弄得无所适从，势必形成总结工作时现象罗列，没有中心，不能解决问题。如我们这次在整供销问题中，确定计划问题是其中之一。我们就找这方面的材料，检查去年的计划和完成的程度，检查今年粮食的产量，和供销部门今年第四季度与一九五一年的计划，看它是根据什么条件、用什么方法作计划等。另外在检查工作、汇集材料时，一定要认真的学习有关方面的文件，这样，才能够分析材料，提高认识。如县委本身不看文件、不管如何研究材料，认识上总是停滞在自己现有的水平。其次，因为材料不可能由县委全部亲身去搜集，故对待一个材料，首先要检查它的真实性，才能了解问题的真象。
