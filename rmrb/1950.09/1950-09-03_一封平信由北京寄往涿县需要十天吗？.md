　　Does it take ten days for a regular letter from Beijing to Zhuoxian?
    To the editor, Comrade Shi Baoshan writes:
    Three letters sent from the Health Department of the North China Military Region in Beijing to the Cadre Sanatorium in Zhuoxian on August 15th were delayed for eleven days en route (the Beijing Post Office stamped them on August 16th, while the Zhuoxian Post Office stamped them on August 26th).
    Beijing is only a few stops away from Zhuoxian Station. We can see the People's Daily issued from Beijing on the same day, so why does it take eleven days for a letter? These letters were instructions from the Health Department of the Military Region to us. Due to the delay, our work has suffered losses. We hope the post office will investigate this matter promptly.

　　一封平信由北京寄往涿县需要十天吗？
    史宝山同志来信编辑同志：
    华北军区卫生部于八月十五日自北京发至涿县干部疗养院的三封信，竟在中途耽误了十一天（北京邮政局是八月十六日加盖的戳记，而涿县邮政局是八月二十六日加盖的戳记）。
    北京距涿县车站只有几站，北京发出的人民日报，我们当天就能看到，为什么一封信需要十一天的时间呢？这些信件都是军区卫生部对我们的指示信。由于迟到，使我们的工作受到了损失。希望邮政局将这件事迅速检查出来。
