　　Model Sailor Li Liansheng
    Protecting People's Ships, Actively Supporting the Front Lines
    Li Liansheng is the first engineer of the Yongshui steamer, a private company in Hunan, and a labor hero who bravely protected the ship and actively supported the front lines. From the eulogy given to him by all the workers of the Yongshui steamer, we can see the workers' respect and love for him.
    Model worker Li Liansheng, at fifty-three, is full of spirit;
    He fears not the hail of bullets, his heart set on protecting the Yongshui.
    Brave and active, truly capable, his class love is as deep as the sea;
    We must all learn from him, the great cause of national construction relies on us.
    On July 10th last year, when Yichang was about to be liberated, the Yongshui steamer driven by Li Liansheng, along with other ships, was forced by the Kuomintang bandit army to load ammunition and equipment. By the 15th, the People's Liberation Army was approaching, and the bandit army set fire to ships everywhere before fleeing. Li Liansheng sent his comrades to hide in the mountains and guarded the ship alone. At a little after one o'clock in the evening, several bandits came with explosives to blow up the ship. Li Liansheng calmly said to the bandits, "The chief of staff told me that this ammunition and equipment is very important. No matter what, we must wait for him to come back and decide personally." The bandits were still not reassured, so Old Li took out the kerosene he had prepared and placed it in front of them: "You see, the kerosene is ready. If the chief of staff doesn't come, we will definitely burn it ourselves." In this way, with his wit and courage, he dealt with the bandits. At that time, the ships near the Yongshui steamer were all on fire, but Old Li calmly started the engine, completely isolating the Yongshui steamer from the fire, and constantly used water to put out the fireballs flying onto the ship, thus preserving the ship and ammunition equipment intact. After the liberation of Yichang, these ammunition and equipment were safely handed over to the People's Liberation Army. At that time, almost all the ships docked in Yichang were burned by the bandit army, and the People's Liberation Army had to cross the river to pursue the enemy, so Li Liansheng immediately brought back the workers hidden in the mountains, quickly lit the fire, started the ship, and transported the People's Liberation Army back and forth, enabling the People's Liberation Army to advance rapidly towards western Hunan. Li Liansheng thus made the first great contribution to protecting the ship and supporting the front lines.
    Later, the Yongshui steamer continued to shoulder the important task of supporting the front lines. On August 30th last year, when the ship was traveling to Majiayue in Deshan near Changde, it was attacked by four bandit planes. The ship caught fire, and several people were killed and injured. Li Liansheng remained calm as usual and led the crew into the water to put out the fire. The ship and military supplies were safely preserved, so he made his second great contribution.
    Li Liansheng also has amazing achievements in studying technology. Before he came to the Yongshui steamer, the ship's engine often had problems, and the fire grate always failed to start. The stokers sometimes burned their hands and faces but could do nothing. The company hired many experienced engineers to inspect and repair it, but they could not find the problem. After Old Li came, he carefully checked and studied it, and found that it was because the outlet of the exhaust valve on the engine furnace was too large, and the steam flow was uneven. After he modified the exhaust valve and repaired the piston, the fire grate became easy to burn. Previously, a stoker could only persist in working for one hour at most, but now they can work for five or six hours and still feel relaxed. Coal consumption was also reduced from 800 catties per hour to 600 catties, saving 25 percent. Not only that, but the speed of the ship also increased by 25 percent as a result. Previously, it took seven or eight days to tow goods from Hankou to Changsha, but now, towing the same tonnage of goods, it only takes four or five days.
    In the past, the oiling equipment of the Yongshui steamer's cylinder was extremely imperfect. It relied entirely on human power to pour oil into the oil pipe with a spoon at any time. Sometimes the oil would not go down and would stay in the oil pipe, and the machine would be damaged if it did not get oil. Sometimes too much oil went down, which was too wasteful. Li Liansheng devised an oil press, using steam power to appropriately press oil into the cylinder at any time. In this way, not only was oil consumption reduced by 40 percent compared to before, but also the labor of adding oil was saved, from adding oil five times per hour to adding oil once every three hours. The machine was also free from problems because it was lubricated by oil. After the news spread, many shipyard workers rushed to learn from him, and now almost all the ships in Hunan Province have imitated the Yongshui steamer's method to improve the oiling equipment.
    Li Liansheng also has an outstanding characteristic, which is that he is good at uniting everyone. He does the best in uniting the capitalists and caring for his fellow workers. Under his leadership, the workers on the Yongshui steamer are united like a friendly and cooperative family.
    Originally, the responsibility of the first engineer was to guide the work, but he also often did the work himself. When he saw that the apprentices could not shovel coal properly, he personally helped them shovel and patiently told them how to shovel coal. He taught others all his skills without reservation. He never asked the apprentices to wash his clothes. Whenever the ship started, he would stay in the engine room. He would take the lead in small repairs and work together on major repairs, without any airs. In addition, he can also understand the difficulties of the workers and the capitalists. Once, the company was in difficulty, and wages and food were not paid. Some of the workers complained. On the one hand, he explained that the company had difficulties and that we workers should be considerate of the capitalists. On the other hand, he moved the oil, salt, firewood, and rice from his home to the ship for everyone to eat, and he also found ways to maintain food supplies outside. He often helped the apprentices when their families had difficulties. Therefore, the crew members were reluctant to leave him, and the young workers affectionately called him "Uncle."

　　模范海员李连生
    保护人民船只·积极支援前线
    李连生是湖南私营长津轮船公司永绥轮的正司机，是英勇护船、积极支援前线的劳动英雄。从永绥轮全体工友给他的颂词中，可以看出工人弟兄们对他的敬佩与热爱。
    工人模范李连生，五十三岁好精神；
    枪林弹雨他不怕，一心保护永绥轮。
    勇敢积极真能干，阶级友爱海样深；
    大家要向他学习，建国大业靠咱们。
    当去年七月十日，宜昌快要解放的时候，李连生驾驶的永绥轮及其他船只被国民党匪军强迫装上了弹药和器材。到十五日解放军已经逼近，匪军在逃跑前，到处放火烧船；李连生把伙伴们送到山里藏起来，独自一个人守在船上；晚上一点多钟，几个匪军带着炸药来炸船，李连生非常沉着的对匪军说：“这个船参谋长对我说过了，这些弹药器材很重要，不管怎么，一定要等他回来亲自决定。”匪徒还不放心，老李就把早已准备好的洋油提出来，摆在他们面前：“你们看，洋油都准备好了，如果参谋长不来，我们自己一定烧。”就这样凭着他的机智和勇敢，把匪军应付走了。当时永绥轮附近的船都起了火，老李沉着的开动机器，使永绥轮与火路完全隔绝，并随时用水扑灭飞到船上的火球，因此完好无损的把船与弹药器材保全下来。在宜昌解放后，这些弹药和器材都安全的交给了解放军。那时泊在宜昌的船只几乎全被匪军烧光，而解放军要渡江追赶敌人，于是李连生立刻把藏在山里的工友找回来，很快地升火开船，来回运送解放军，使解放军得以迅速向湘西挺进。李连生因此立下了护船支援前线的第一大功。
    以后永绥轮一直担负着支援前线的重任。去年八月三十日，船行至常德附近的德山马家月，遭遇四架匪机的袭击，船上着了火，还死伤了几个人，李连生镇静如常，率领船员下水，扑灭了火，船和军用品都得以安全保存，于是他又立了第二次大功。
    李连生在钻研技术上也有惊人的成绩。在他没到永绥轮时，永绥轮的机器经常出毛病，火磅总是烧不起，司炉的工人有时手脸都烤起了泡也没办法，公司请了许多老司机检查修理，结果也找不出毛病来。老李来了以后，就详细的检查研究，发现是因为机炉上排汽门的出口太大，汽流不均匀，经他改装排汽门，修理了活塞，这一来，火磅好烧了，从前一个生火的工人最多只能坚持工作一小时，现在能工作五、六小时，还很轻爽，用煤也由每小时八百斤，减为六百斤，节省了百分之二十五。不但如此，船行的速度也因之增加了百分之二十五。从前由汉口到长沙拖货得七、八天，现在照原来的吨位拖货，只要四、五天就到了。
    从前永绥轮汽缸的进油设备极不健全，纯靠人力随时用调羹把油灌到油管里去，有时油不下去，停留在油管子里，机器得不到油就要受损失；有时油下去得太多，又太浪费。李连生设法创制了一个压油机，利用汽力随时适当地将油压进汽缸，这一来，不但油耗较前减少百分之四十，还节省了加油的人力，由从前每小时加油五次，减到三小时加油一次，机器因为得到油的润滑，毛病也没有了。消息传开后，马上有很多轮船的工友都争着来学习，现在几乎全湖南省的轮船都模仿永绥轮的办法改进了进油设备。
    李连生还有一个杰出的特点，就是善于团结大家。他在团结资方，关心工人弟兄方面，是做得最好的。永绥轮上的工友在他带领下，团结得像一个友爱合作的大家庭。
    本来，正司机的职责是指导工作，但他还要经常亲自动手作活。他看到学徒扒煤扒不到，亲自就帮着扒，并耐心告诉扒煤方法。他有的技术，都毫无保留的尽量教给别人。他的衣服，总不叫学徒洗。每逢船一开头，他就不离机舱，小修时先动手，大修时一齐干，一点架子没有。此外，他也能体念工友们与资方的困难。有一次，公司困窘，工薪伙食没有发。工友们有些抱怨，他一方面解释公司有困难，我们工人应体谅资方；一方面把家里的油、盐、柴、米搬到船上大伙儿吃饭，又在外面想法维持伙食。学徒家里有困难，他也常常帮助他们。因此，船员都不愿离开他，青年工友们都很亲切的喊他“叔叔”。
