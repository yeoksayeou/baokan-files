Special-Class Production Model Worker Wang Zhijian

　　Guoyu Village, Sanhetun, District Seven, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, was originally a remote village in the northern Manchurian prairie, but now it has become a well-known place throughout the province. This is because Wang Zhijian, the famous special-class labor mutual aid model in the province and representative to the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers, and his mutual aid group live here. They have set an example of labor mutual aid in the province, county, district, and village, and the working people of the province have constantly challenged, competed with, and learned from them.

　　Wang Zhijian, this hardworking 51-year-old peasant, like hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants, spent many years of suffering in the old society. He started herding pigs and sheep for landlords at the age of eight, and carried half-loads at the age of fifteen. The vigorous Wang Zhijian was not satisfied with this life of servitude and wanted to find a way out of the old society. He started learning carpentry at the age of seventeen, but failed, and at the age of twenty he carried heavy loads for landlords again. From the age of twenty-five, Wang Zhijian worked as a plasterer for twelve years, and then learned the craft of stone masonry. For the next ten years or so, he supported his family by relying on his craftsmanship and doing some agricultural production, but the situation was not good.

　　Before the land reform, Sanhetun was a world of landlords, and a few poor peasants and farmhands were ragged and underfed. Land reform brought happiness to the people, and everyone was given land and houses. Wang Zhijian cherished the fruits of his liberation even more, getting up early and going to bed late, working in the fields all day long. As a result of intensive cultivation, in 1948, the 5.6 hectares of land he was allocated yielded 24.7 shi of grain. That year, he was selected as a first-class individual labor model in the province.

　　At the provincial labor model conference, the higher-ups called out, "Labor models should lead a good mutual aid group." Wang Zhijian kept this sentence firmly in his heart. The following year—in the spring of 1949, Wang Zhijian mobilized seven peasant households to organize. Originally, everyone did not understand labor mutual aid and did not know what benefits there were to organizing. Some people felt that seven or eight households together would cause restlessness day and night. Stronger households were even more afraid of suffering losses. Wang Zhijian mobilized them, saying, "Let's try it out. If there are losses, we will find a way to solve them. If it really doesn't work, you can withdraw at any time." At that time, everyone organized with a try-it-and-see attitude.

　　Wang Zhijian's group of seven households had six and a half laborers, seven horses, and cultivated 45.12 hectares of land. That year, the average yield per hectare was 5.224 shi of grain, an increase of 62 percent compared to the average yield of 3.224 shi per hectare before land reform. Due to this significant achievement, Wang Zhijian was awarded the title of Special-Class Labor Mutual Aid Model in Heilongjiang Province. In 1950, he was also invited to attend the Second Heilongjiang Provincial Political Consultative Conference. Subsequently, three more peasant households in the village joined his group. In the spring of 1950, the Provincial People's Government lent Wang Zhijian's group a set of new Soviet-style horse-drawn farm implements. At this time, Wang Zhijian's group became ten households, ten laborers, sixteen horses, and cultivated 70.37 hectares of cultivated land. This year they also opened up 30 mu of wasteland; the whole group plans to produce 6 shi of grain per hectare of cultivated land and 4.5 shi per hectare of wasteland this year, for a total of more than 550 shi of grain, and strive to reach 600 shi. In this way, each laborer must cultivate 10 hectares of land, and each laborer must produce 55 shi of grain.

　　Some people may ask: What methods did Wang Zhijian's group use to create such achievements?

　　Wang Zhijian's mutual aid group mainly achieved the following aspects: First, implementing the principle of equivalent exchange and mutual benefit consolidated the foundation of the group. Human labor exchange is based on skill level, strength of labor, and daily evaluation of work points. For example, when opening up wasteland in the spring, people and horses are tired, so they are given one more point than usual. The exchange of human labor and livestock labor is based on seasonal changes: when the livestock are tired during spring plowing, it is stipulated that one and a half units of human labor exchange for one unit of horse labor; when people are busy and horses are idle during summer weeding, it is stipulated that one unit of human labor exchanges for one unit of horse labor. Horse points are evaluated once a month. For example, Xu Huan's horse, when it was first bought, was thin and not very good at working, so it was rated at seven points. Later, when the horse was fattened, it was increased by two points. This is not only reasonable but also encourages group members to buy good livestock. Second, democratic solutions were found for the issue of who weeds first and who weeds last. The issue of who weeds first and who weeds last is most likely to cause disputes during summer weeding. Wang Zhijian's group stipulates that democratic evaluation should be carried out to determine whose land is barren first and whose land should be weeded first; and it should be flexibly applied according to the amount of labor and the amount of land. Third, the problem of having too little labor and too much land or too little land and too much labor was solved. Before hoeing, they calculated whether the entire group's labor force could bear the task of hoeing all the land. If so, they exchanged labor and helped each other within the group by recording points; if not, households with too little labor and too much land hired temporary help. Fourth, rational division of labor maximized labor efficiency. All men, women, old and young in the group participated in various labors. For example, some plant crops, some repair warehouses at home, build stables, or do other odd jobs, recording points to exchange labor with each other. Women and children also participated in appropriate work. When using new farm implements, it is generally the weaker ones who work. This allows both strong and weak labor to achieve the same work efficiency.

　　At the same time, Wang Zhijian's group achieved intensive cultivation. First of all, in terms of fertilization, in 1949, 27 hectares of the group's 45.12 hectares of land were fertilized with manure (referring to pig and horse manure); in 1950, 43 hectares of the 70.37 hectares of land were fertilized (referring to pig blood, sesame oil, etc.), and 27 hectares were fertilized with manure. Second, in terms of seed selection, their seeds are reselected and germination tested every year before sowing. The wheat is the Kehua high-quality variety, and the soybeans are the Zi Hua No. 4 and Si Li Huang varieties. In order to prevent insect pests, the wheat seeds were disinfected with Wang Copper before sowing; other seeds were soaked in tobacco stalk water. Third, more weeding and tilling. Before land reform, the land of ordinary farmers was weeded and tilled at most twice. In 1949, most of the land of Wang Zhijian's group was weeded and tilled four times, autumn furrows were made, and large weeds were pulled. In 1950, all the land was weeded and tilled four times, and 12 hectares of land were weeded and tilled five times, as well as making autumn furrows and pulling large weeds once. The reason why Wang Zhijian's group can weed and till more is mainly because they sow five days earlier than other mutual aid groups. Furthermore, their creation of the "double break single digging" method improved cultivation technology, saved labor, and further achieved intensive cultivation. Fourth, advanced Soviet-style new horse-drawn farm implements were used. In the spring plowing of 1950, his group saved 55 man-days and 36 horse-days, and completed the spring plowing six days earlier. During summer weeding, four weeder-tillers were used, saving 150 man-days and 70 horse-days. Fifth, expanding the cultivated area directly increased the yield. In 1949, Wang Zhijian's group opened up 8 hectares of wasteland, and in 1950, they opened up 30 hectares of wasteland. Wang Zhijian himself was allocated 5.6 hectares of land in the land reform, and now it has increased to 11 hectares. In the past two years, the entire village has opened up more than 230 hectares of wasteland. The once barren prairie is now full of green crops.

　　Wang Zhijian is an excellent Communist Party member, and he deeply understands that the wisdom of the masses is infinite. He also understands that if he wants to concentrate everyone's wisdom and do a good job in production, the leader must fully promote democracy. Group meetings and self-criticism meetings have become the most interesting regular meetings for the entire group. At the meetings, people study sowing, discuss wasteland reclamation, discuss all matters of production, or conduct criticism and self-criticism. Wang Zhijian often said: "If the group leader does not talk about democracy, there is no way to promote work; the group leader cannot be dictatorial, and everyone should hold a meeting to review their shortcomings."

　　The work of Wang Zhijian's mutual aid group every quarter is discussed by the branch in advance; then it is studied and revised in detail in the group, resolutions are made, plans are drawn up, and implemented accordingly. They have always been able to complete and exceed the plan each time. As group member Gao Qinghui said: "Having a plan gives you a goal, and you work harder." Yes, farmers are gradually changing their scattered habits in production organizations.

　　Wang Zhijian understands that cultivating activists is the key to doing all work well. He adopted methods such as helping group members Gao Qinghui, praising them for their progress, and inviting them to participate in district and village cadre meetings to stimulate their enthusiasm and improve their awareness. Activists have played a certain leading and promoting role in various tasks.

　　特等生产模范王治俭
    黑龙江省讷河县七区国裕村三合屯，原先是北满草原中一个偏僻小村，但现在却成了全省尽人皆知的地方。因为在这里住着全省著名的特等劳动互助模范、出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议的代表王治俭和他的互助小组。他们在省、县、区、村树立了劳动互助的榜样，全省劳动人民曾不断地向他们挑战竞赛与学习。
    王治俭，这位五十一岁的勤苦农民，和中国千百万农民一样，曾在旧社会里度过了许多苦难的岁月。他从八岁开始，就给地主放猪，放羊，十五岁扛半活。血气方刚的王治俭，不满意这种牛马生活，想从旧社会里打出一条生活的出路。十七岁开始学木匠，不成，二十岁又给地主扛大活。从二十五岁起始，王治俭又做了十二年的泥水匠，之后，又学了石匠手艺。以后的十多年来，他凭着手艺和兼做些农业生产，维持着一家人的生活，但状况并不好。
    三合屯在实行土地改革以前，是地主的世界，几户贫雇农，衣着褴褛，食不饱腹。土地改革给人民带来了幸福，大家分得了土地和房屋。王治俭更珍惜翻身的果实，早起晚睡，成天在地里作活。由于精耕细作的结果，一九四八年，他分得的五垧六亩地打了二十四石七斗粮食。当年他被选为全省一等个人劳动模范。
    在省劳动模范大会上，上级号召：“劳模要领导好一个互助组”，王治俭把这句话牢牢地记在了心里。次年——一九四九年春天，王治俭动员了七户农民组织起来。原先大家对劳动互助没有认识，不知道组织起来有什么好处。有人觉得七、八户凑在一块，会闹得日夜不安。人强马壮户更怕吃了亏。王治俭动员说：“咱们试试看，有吃亏的地方想法解决，实在不行，可以随时退出。”当时大家就抱着试试看的态度组织了起来。
    王治俭小组七户中有六个半劳动力，七匹马，种四十五垧一亩二分地。当年每垧地平均收成粮食五石二斗四升，较土地改革前的每垧地平均收成三石二斗四升，提高了百分之六十二。由于这显著的成绩，王治俭荣膺黑龙江省特等劳动互助模范的称号。一九五○年并被邀列席参加了黑龙江省第二次省政治协商会议。接着，该村又有三户农民参加了他的小组。一九五○年春，省人民政府贷给王治俭小组一套苏联新式马拉农具。这时，王治俭小组成了十户，十个劳动力，十六匹马，耕种着七十垧三亩七分熟地。今年他们又开了三十亩荒；全组计划今年每垧熟地生产六石粮食，荒地为四石五斗，共计生产粮食五百五十余石，并争取要达到六百石。这样，每个劳动力须耕作十垧土地，每个劳动力须生产五十五石粮食。
    有人会问：王治俭小组用什么方法创造出这样的成绩呢？
    王治俭互助小组主要作到了以下几方面：一、贯彻等价两利原则，巩固了小组基础。人力换工是根据技术好坏，劳力强弱，并每天评活分。如春天开荒时人马都累，就较平时多评一分。人与牲畜换工根据季节转换：春耕时牲畜累，规定一个半人工换一马工；夏锄时人忙马闲，规定一个人工换一马工。马的分是一个月评一次。如组员徐焕的马，才买来时，瘦弱不太会干活，评了七分。以后马喂胖了就增加了两分。这样不但合理，还可刺激组员买好牲畜。二、民主解决了先铲后铲问题。先铲后铲在夏锄中最容易发生纠纷。王治俭小组规定民主评定谁家的地先荒，先铲谁家的；并按照劳力多少、地亩多少的情况灵活运用。三、解决了劳力少地多和地少劳力多的问题。铲趟前，他们算好全组的人力是否能负担全部土地的铲趟任务，如能就在组内以记分方法换工互助；不能时则由人少地多户雇人临时补助。四、合理分工发挥劳动效能。全组男女老少分别参加各种劳动。如有的种田，有的在家修仓房，盖马棚或做其他零活，彼此记分换工。妇女儿童也都参加了适当的工作。使用新农具时，一般是让体力较弱者充任。这样就使强弱劳力均能发挥同样的工作效能。
    同时，王治俭小组做到了精耕细作。首先在施肥方面，一九四九年全组四十五垧一亩二分地中，上粪（指猪马粪）二十七垧；一九五○年七十垧三亩七分地中，施肥（指猪血、麻油等）四十三垧，上粪二十七垧。第二、在选种方面，他们每年的籽种都是经过复选与发芽试验后才下种。小麦是克华优良品种，大豆是紫花四号和四粒黄。为了防止虫灾，播种前小麦种经过王铜消毒；其他种籽都用烟秆水浸过一遍。第三，多铲多趟。土地改革前，一般农户的土地顶多铲趟两遍。一九四九年，王治俭小组的土地大部做到了四铲四趟，放秋垄，和拔大草。一九五○年全部土地做到了四铲四趟，并有十二垧土地做到了五铲五趟，及放秋垄，拔一遍大草。王治俭小组能多铲趟的原因，主要是较其他互助组播种早五天。更由于他们创造了“双破单掏”的办法，提高了耕作技术，省了工，进一步的做到精耕细作。第四，使用了先进的苏联新式马拉农具。一九五○年春耕时，他的小组节省了五十五个人工，三十六个马工，且提早六天完成春耕。夏锄时使用了四台铲趟机，节省了一百五十个人工，和七十个马工。第五，扩大耕地面积，直接增加了产量。一九四九年，王治俭小组开荒八垧，一九五○年开荒三十垧。王治俭本人在土地改革中分到五垧六亩土地，如今已增加到十一垧。两年来，全村已开荒二百三十余垧。早先荒凉草原，今天已是遍地青青的庄稼了。
    王治俭是一个优秀的共产党员，他深深懂得：群众的智慧是无穷的。他也懂得要想集中大家的智慧，搞好生产，领导者必须充分发扬民主。小组会，检讨会已成为全组最感兴趣的例会。人们在会上，研究下种，讨论开荒，商量生产上一切的事情或进行批评自我批评。王治俭常说：当组长不讲民主，就没法推动工作；当组长是不能独断独行的，大家有缺点就应开会检讨。
    王治俭互助小组每季度的工作，事先都经过支部讨论；然后再在小组里详细研究修改，做出决议，拟订计划，遵照执行。他们每次都能按照计划完成并超过它。正如组员高庆惠所说：“有计划就有了个目标，干活更起劲。”是的，农民们在生产组织中，逐步地改变着散漫的习惯。
    王治俭懂得培养积极分子，是做好一切工作的关键。他对组员高庆惠等，采取了多帮助、有进步就表扬，邀请参加区村干部会等方法，启发他们的积极性，提高他们的觉悟。积极分子在各种工作中都起了一定的带头、推动作用。
