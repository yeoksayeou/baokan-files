　　Jiangxi Province Achieves Success in Agricultural Loans in the First Half of the Year
    Significant Increases in Grain and Cotton Production
    Facts Prove That the Key Distribution Policy is Entirely Correct
    [Our Dispatch] In order to support farmers in disaster areas in increasing grain and cotton production, the People's Bank of Jiangxi Province issued a large number of agricultural loans in the spring and summer seasons and achieved considerable success. Since February of this year, the bank has focused on disaster areas, revolving around the production of cotton and grain, and issued various loans for seeds, fertilizers, draft cattle, agricultural implements, water conservancy, and food rations. As of the end of June, under the unified leadership of the Party and government and with the cooperation of various forces in sixty-seven counties across the province, a total of more than 20.03 million catties of rice were distributed, including more than 15.95 million catties for spring plowing loans, more than 3.42 million catties for summer loans, and more than 940,000 catties for large-scale water conservancy loans. In terms of seed and fertilizer loans, production difficulties for nearly 1.25 million mu of cultivated land can be resolved, and it is estimated that rice production will increase by approximately 312.315 million catties; large-scale water conservancy loans are targeted at the Anfu and Wan'an canals, benefiting 36,000 mu of fields, and it is estimated that rice production will increase by approximately 2.22 million catties. In terms of supporting cotton production increase: cotton fields benefiting reached 56,456 mu, which can increase ginned cotton production by approximately 1.129 million catties; in addition, more than 7.921 million catties of rice were loaned for food rations, solving the food shortage difficulties for 164,643 full laborers, enabling them to concentrate on farming. More than 100,000 catties of rice were loaned for small-scale water conservancy projects such as digging ponds, repairing dams, and purchasing waterwheels, solving the irrigation problems for 8,057 mu of fields. More than 553,000 catties of rice were loaned for special products such as sugarcane and tobacco fertilizer, enabling some poor farmers to no longer have to rely on usurious loans to maintain production. More than 433,000 catties of rice were loaned for draft cattle and agricultural implements, solving the difficulties of poor farmers lacking draft cattle and agricultural implements. Approximately four-fifths of the total loan amount was allocated to major flood-stricken areas. If there had not been this large amount of loan assistance after the dike repairs, it would have been difficult to restore production on nearly 900,000 mu this year, and 150,000 laborers would have lacked food rations and been unable to cultivate, having to engage in sideline occupations or flee the famine. This proves that this year's spring and summer loans, focusing on disaster areas and with seeds and food rations as the main purposes, was the correct distribution principle.
    Among the 338,561 households borrowing in the spring and summer seasons, poor peasants accounted for 88.8 percent, and the rest were middle peasants, revolutionary martyrs, and military families. The policy of supporting production and assisting poor peasants has been basically implemented, which has not only developed production but also improved the political awareness of the peasants.
    However, due to the large numbers involved and the lack of tight leadership and insufficient cadre qualifications, the spring and summer loan work in the first half of the year also had many shortcomings. For example, in Zhantian Township, Ningdu, 2,000 catties of rice were divided up by six village chiefs. Another example is that in Xingzi County, due to the adjustment of quotas, 10,000 catties of rice were added to the Third District Fourth Farmers' Association. During the work process, the Third and Fifth Farmers' Associations jointly coerced the Fourth Farmers' Association to divide the rice equally, and surrounded and threatened them with weapons. Later, after persuasion and education by the district government, the rice was finally distributed to the Fourth Farmers' Association. In addition, some borrowers did not understand the policy enough and distributed the rice they received to uncles, brothers, sons, nephews, and relatives, believing that this was the government's benevolence and everyone should enjoy a little bit. There were also some counties that distributed loans without focus, with small amounts spread across the entire county, treating agricultural loans as disaster relief. All these phenomena show that the cadres' qualifications are not up to the needs of the task, and the prior propaganda and education work and preparation work were not done adequately. This is something that must be seriously improved in future work. (Jiao Jianlong)

　　江西省上半年农贷获成绩
    粮食棉花大量增产
    事实证明重点发放方针完全正确
    【本报讯】江西省人民银行为扶植灾区农民增产粮食棉花，春夏两季曾发放大批农贷并获得相当大的成绩。该行自今年二月份起，就以灾区为重点，环绕着棉粮的生产，发放种籽、肥料、耕牛、农具、水利、口粮等多种贷款，截至六月底止，全省六十七县在党政的统一领导与各方面力量配合下，共放出稻谷二千零三十余万斤，其中春耕贷款一千五百九十五万余斤，夏贷三百四十二万余斤，大型水利贷款九十四万余斤。在种籽肥料贷款方面，可解决近一百二十五万亩耕地的生产困难，估计约增产稻谷三亿一千二百三十一万五千斤；大型水利贷款对象为安福、万安两渠，受益田三万六千亩，估计约增产稻谷二百二十万余斤。扶植棉花增产方面：受益棉田达五万六千四百五十六亩，约可增产皮棉一百一十二万九千余斤；另贷放了口粮稻谷七百九十二万一千余斤，解决了十六万四千六百四十三个全劳动力缺乏口粮的困难，使他们能专心努力耕作。贷放了挖塘、修坝、购买水车等小型水利贷款稻谷十万余斤，解决了八千零五十七亩田的灌溉问题。贷放了特产如甘蔗、烟叶等肥料贷款稻谷五十五万三千余斤，使部分贫苦农民不再非依靠高利贷维持生产不可。发放耕牛农具等贷款稻谷四十三万三千余斤，解决了贫苦农民缺乏耕牛农具的困难。贷款总额中约五分之四配放到主要水灾地区，在圩堤修复后，如果没有此项大量贷款扶助，则今年将有近九十万亩的生产难以恢复，十五万个劳动力缺乏口粮，无力耕种，须从事副业或外出逃荒。这证明了今年春贷夏贷以灾区为重点，以种籽、口粮为主要用途的发放原则是正确的。
    春、夏两季借款总户三十三万八千五百六十一户中，贫农占百分之八八·八，余为中农及烈、军属。基本上是贯彻了扶植生产的方针，扶助了贫苦农民，不仅发展了生产，而且提高了农民的政治觉悟。
    但上半年的春贷夏贷工作，由于数字的庞大与领导上抓的不紧，干部条件的不够，缺点也是很多的。如宁都湛田乡二千斤稻谷由六个村长分摊了。又如星子县因调整配额加放第三区第四农会稻谷一万斤，在进行工作时，三农会和五农会就联合挟持四农会均分，并携带武器包围威胁。嗣后经区政府说服教育，才算放到四农会。还有部分贷户对政策了解不够，把本人领得的稻谷，分与伯叔、兄弟、子侄和亲戚等，认为这是政府的德泽，大家都应该享受一点。另有部分县份贷放无重点，全县普降小雨，把农贷视同赈济。这一切现象都说明干部的条件赶不上任务的需要，事前的宣传教育工作布置准备工作作的都不够，这是必须在今后的工作中切实注意改进的。（焦建龙）
