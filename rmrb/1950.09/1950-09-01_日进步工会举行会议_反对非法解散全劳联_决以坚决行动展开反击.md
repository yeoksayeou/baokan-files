　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 31st: According to the Kyodo News Agency in Tokyo: Twelve trade unions, including the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, the All-Japan Metalworkers' Union, and the All-Japan Communications Workers' Union (Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union), held a meeting on the 30th to discuss the illegal dissolution of the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council. The meeting issued a statement saying: The measure to dissolve the National Federation of Labor Unions is an act of destroying democracy. We must launch a counterattack against this violent oppression with resolute action.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 31st: While continuously "purging" and "dismissing" progressive Japanese workers, the American and Japanese reactionaries illegally dissolved the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council (National Federation of Labor Unions), the largest trade union organization in Japan, on the 30th, further suppressing the progressive Japanese workers' movement.
　　According to the Kyodo News Agency in Tokyo, the Special Examination Bureau of the Ministry of Justice of the Yoshida government ordered the dissolution of the National Federation of Labor Unions on the 30th based on the so-called "Ordinance on the Regulation of Organizations, etc." At the same time, it also "purged" twelve cadres of the union, including Kazuyoshi Tsuchibashi, a member of the House of Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party. On the same day, under the direction of officials from the Special Examination Bureau, about 150 armed police officers illegally searched the National Federation of Labor Unions office for about two hours. The police confiscated two truckloads of documents and office supplies. At the same time, another team of police searched the printing house that printed the National Federation of Labor Unions publications and also confiscated many things.
　　This unreasonable measure by the American and Japanese reactionaries to dissolve the National Federation of Labor Unions is only the beginning of intensified persecution of Japanese trade unions. Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsuo Okazaki of the Yoshida Cabinet publicly stated when meeting with reporters on the 30th: "In the future, there may be measures to dissolve and purge trade union organizations."
　　Note: The National Federation of Labor Unions was established on March 10, 1947. At that time, it brought together the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, the Japanese Federation of Trade Unions, the National Railway Workers' Union, and other independent trade unions, becoming the only large trade union in Japan. However, under the sabotage of American and Japanese monopoly groups and their running dogs, the Federation of Trade Unions, controlled by right-wing social democratic splitters, first withdrew from the National Federation of Labor Unions in mid-1948. Since then, a small number of member unions have withdrawn from the union under the instigation of splitters. Nevertheless, the National Federation of Labor Unions has always fought unyieldingly for the interests of the Japanese working class, for improving workers' lives and for striving for peace and democracy, and joined the World Federation of Trade Unions in early 1949. The American and Japanese reactionaries have been constantly persecuting and suppressing the National Federation of Labor Unions from the beginning. Its organ, the Labor News, was closed down more than a month ago. The National Federation of Labor Unions now has 1.2 million members, uniting more than 20 member unions.

### 日进步工会举行会议  反对非法解散全劳联  决以坚决行动展开反击

　　日进步工会举行会议
    反对非法解散全劳联         
    决以坚决行动展开反击
    【新华社三十一日讯】据共同社东京讯：全日产业别工会联合会、全日金属工会以及全递信工会（邮电工会）等十二个工会，于三十日举行会议，讨论全日工会联络协议会被非法解散事件。会议发表声明称：解散全劳联的措施，是破坏民主的行动，对于这种暴压，必须以坚决的行动展开反击。
    【新华社三十一日讯】美、日反动派在不断“整肃”与“解雇”日本进步职工的同时，又于三十日非法解散日本最大的工会组织全日工会联络协议会（全劳联），进一步镇压日本的进步职工运动。
    据共同社东京讯，吉田政府法务府特别审查局根据所谓《团体等规正令》于三十日下令解散全劳联。同时并“整肃”该工会干部十二人，其中包括日本共产党众议员土桥一吉。当日清晨，在特别审查局的主管官员指挥下，约有一百五十名武装警察非法搜查全劳联办公室约达二小时之久。警察没收了两卡车的文件及办公室用具。同时，另有一队警察曾搜查承印全劳联刊物的印刷所，也没收了许多东西。
    美日反动派这一解散全劳联的无理措施，只是加紧迫害日本工会的开端。吉田内阁书记长官冈崎胜男在三十日接见记者团时公开声称：“今后对工会组织也许还有解散、整肃的措施。”                                                
    按：全劳联是在一九四七年三月十日成立的。当时它集合了全日产业别工会联合会、日本工会总同盟、国营铁道工会以及其他独立工会，成为日本唯一的大工会。但是，在美、日垄断集团及其走狗的破坏下，为右翼社会民主主义分裂分子所控制的工会总同盟，首先于一九四八年年中退出了全劳联。此后，又有少数会员工会在分裂分子的教唆下退会。虽然如此，全劳联却始终坚定不屈地为日本工人阶级的利益而斗争，为改善工人生活与争取和平民主而斗争，并于一九四九年初参加了世界工会联合会。美、日反动派自始就对全劳联进行不断的迫害与镇压，它的机关报劳动新闻，已在一个多月以前被封闭。全劳联现在拥有会员一百二十万名，团结着二十个以上的会员工会。
