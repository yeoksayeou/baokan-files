　　Workers Strive to Process and Greet National Day
　　The Eastern Section of Jingmen Road is Completed Ahead of Schedule
　　[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The cement road on the eastern section of Jingmen Road, from Yuquan Road to the gate of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, was completed ahead of schedule on the 9th of this month. It will be open to traffic after the road surface is tidied up. The completion of this road will help the development of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the power plant's operations, and will also facilitate the transportation of coal from Mentougou to Beijing. The eastern section of the cement road is 7.5 kilometers long and 6 meters wide, covering an area of 45,000 square meters. Construction began on April 28th of this year, and it was originally planned to be completed by the end of October; however, thanks to the efforts of the workers, the project was not only completed ahead of schedule to greet the October 1st National Day, but also improved in quality. The standard load-bearing capacity of a general cement road is 2,000 pounds per square inch, but the eastern section of Jingmen Road has reached more than 2,000 pounds per square inch, with the highest reaching 4,000 pounds.
　　The eastern section of Jingmen Road's cement road was built by the fourth and fifth engineering teams and a roadbed team of the Municipal Construction Bureau, totaling about 260 people. The workers persisted in their work for about five months under the difficult conditions of water and material shortage in the suburbs, and many model deeds emerged. For example, worker Tong Xuchen has always insisted on the heaviest "standing pan" work, without taking a day off, and never being late or leaving early. When the tap water was cut off, he went to the village two miles away at night to fetch water, ensuring the work. In order to complete the work as soon as possible to greet the October 1st National Day, worker Jiang Lu sacrificed his day off and called on other workers to lay cement for a day. Squad leader Wang Fengshan took the lead in his work, did not rest at noon, went to fetch water, and often cleaned and used the remaining materials to avoid waste.
　　[Further Dispatch] The cobblestone simple pavement on the western section of Jingmen Road is being actively built. The western end has been built from Mentougou to Chengzizhen, and the eastern end is being built along the east side of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. The mountain excavation and rerouting project in Moshikou is also nearing completion, and a cement bridge is being built in the new line's mountain ditch.

　　工人努力加工迎接国庆
    京门路东段提前完工
    【京市新闻处讯】京门路东段玉泉路至石景山钢铁厂门前的洋灰路已于本月九日提前完成，俟路面加以整理后，即可通车。该路的修成将帮助石景山钢铁厂和发电厂业务的发展，并可便利门煤运京。东段洋灰路长七公里半，宽六公尺，面积四万五千平方公尺。自本年四月二十八日开工，原计划十月底完成；但在工人们的努力下，为迎接十月一日国庆节，不但提前完工，并且提高了质量。一般的洋灰路一平方英寸载重二千磅已够标准，京门路东段则达到了每一平方英寸载重都在二千磅以上，最高的到四千磅。
    京门路东段洋灰路是由市建设局第四、五两个工程队和一个路基队共约二百六十人修筑的，分为七个盘筑打洋灰，工人们在郊外缺水、缺料的困难条件下坚持工作了约五个月，出现了很多模范事迹。如：工人佟绪臣一直坚持了最重的“站盘”工作，没有请过一天假，也从未迟到早退过。在自来水断水的时候他并在夜里从二里地以外的村子里去拉水，保证了工作。工人姜禄为了早日完成工作迎接十月一日国庆节，牺牲了休息日，号召旁的工人打了一天洋灰。班长王凤山自己带头工作，中午不休息，去拉水，并且经常地清理、使用剩下的材料，避免浪费。
    【又讯】京门路西段卵石简易路面正积极修筑中。西头已自门头沟修到城子镇，东头正沿石景山钢铁厂东边修筑，模式口的开山改线工程也接近完成，正在新线山沟修筑洋灰桥。
