　　Worker-peasant education in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
　　Vocational schools and industrial training classes in the Soviet Union are the main sources for strengthening the ranks of the working class. The Soviet government has opened many schools for working youth and vocational schools throughout the country to train young workers. This year, tens of thousands of young workers graduated from labor middle schools, and another 20,000 young people graduated from vocational schools and are working in factories and mines in the Donets Basin.

　　This year, 376,000 workers, foremen, and technicians across the Soviet Union received advanced technical education in their spare time. Many graduates have become workshop supervisors and engineers. The path from worker to engineer is the path taken by many Stakhanovite workers in the Soviet Union. Currently, 136 schools for working youth in Moscow have enrolled 35,000 new students, who study without affecting their work. Branches are also set up in larger factories. Graduates can also continue their studies in higher education institutions.

　　The various miner training classes run by the Soviet Ministry of Coal Industry will train more than 350,000 skilled technicians this year. Some coal mining areas will open two-year foreman schools this year.

　　The Soviet system has also opened the door for peasants to receive higher education. In the Soviet Central Asian republics, thousands of peasants have received higher education, many of whom have become famous scientists. For example, the president of a university recently opened in the Turkmen Republic, Azimov, came from a hired peasant background. The president of the Kyrgyz Medical College, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, Akhunbaev, is the son of a herdsman.

　　Two million collective farmers in Ukraine studied the most advanced agricultural methods and experiences in schools in the second half of last year. Another 800,000 people will participate in learning this year. More than 60 percent of the students in Azerbaijan's higher education institutions are young farmers. This year, the number of young collective farmers in Lithuania applying to universities is one and a half times that of last year.

　　Since the establishment of people's democratic regimes, the people's democratic countries of Eastern Europe—Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania—have been transforming the old education system, increasing the years of national education, simplifying redundant courses, and establishing scientific, patriotic, and internationalist principles to educate the younger generation, based on the principles of raising the cultural level of workers and peasants and cultivating worker-peasant intellectuals.

　　Currently, the new school systems in Hungary and Romania stipulate that the term of national education is eight years. Czechoslovakia implements a nine-year system, while Poland and Bulgaria implement an eleven-year national education system.

　　All people's democratic countries have greatly expanded and built schools to solve the problem of schooling for the vast number of workers' and peasants' children. After liberation, the number of primary school students in Romania has increased 24 times, and the number of middle school students has increased seven times; the number of primary school students in Albania has increased two and a half times; the number of farmers' children entering primary and secondary schools in Poland has doubled; the number of primary and secondary school students in Bulgaria has increased by 50 percent; and almost all school-age children in Hungary have been enrolled in school.

　　All people's democratic countries have vigorously promoted the work of enabling workers and peasants to attend school and receive higher education. Czechoslovakia has specially established 12 worker-peasant middle schools, Romania has specially established three worker-peasant crash middle schools and 13 advanced technical training schools, and Hungary has 22,000 worker-peasant middle school students. Universities in various countries are enrolling a large number of shock workers. Universities in Bulgaria have established special classes for workers, and in Hungary, 38,000 young workers and peasants have all their study expenses paid by the state.

　　While vigorously developing formal education, all people's democratic countries are also carrying out the work of eliminating illiteracy and improving the culture of the working people through literacy classes and cultural centers. In Albania, 200,000 of the more than 800,000 illiterate people have learned to read and write. Of the 4.2 million illiterate people in Romania, 1.1 million have learned to read and write in the past year and this year alone. Illiteracy in Poland will be completely eliminated in 1951.

　　工农教育在苏联和东欧
    苏联的职业学校与工业训练班，是工人阶级壮大自己队伍的主要泉源。苏联政府已在全国各地开设了许多劳动青年学校与职业学校，专门培养青年工人。今年有数万青年工人，从劳动中学毕业，另有两万青年从职业学校毕业后，在顿尼兹盆地的工厂与矿场工作。
    今年，苏联全国有三十七万六千工人、领班和技师在业余时间受了高等技术教育。许多毕业生已充当了工场监督和工程师。从工人到工程师，这便是苏联许多斯塔哈诺夫工作者所走的道路。现在，莫斯科一百三十六所劳动青年学校已招收了三万五千名新生，在不影响工作的情形下学习。较大的工厂中也设立了分校。毕业生还可继续到高等学校深造。
    苏联煤业部开办的各种矿工训练班，今年将训练出三十五万以上的熟练技工。有些采煤地区将在今年开办两年制的领班学校。
    苏维埃制度也给农民打开了接受高等教育的道路。就苏联中亚细亚各共和国来说，接受高等教育的农民数以千计，其中有许多已成为有名的科学家。例如土库曼共和国最近开办的一所大学，校长阿兹莫夫便是雇农出身。吉尔吉斯医学院院长、苏联医药科学院通讯院士阿克洪巴耶夫，是一个牧人的儿子。
    乌克兰有两百万集体农民，曾于去年下半年在学校学习最先进的农业方法和经验。今年将再有八十万人参加学习。阿塞拜疆高等学校的学生，有百分之六十以上是青年农民，今年，立陶宛投考大学的青年集体农民为去年的一倍半。
    东欧各人民民主国家——波、捷、匈、罗、保和阿尔巴尼亚等国，自建立人民民主政权以来，即本着提高工农文化水平及培养工农知识分子的方针，改造了旧教育制度，提高国民教育年限，简化了冗繁的课程，确立了以科学的、爱国主义的与国际主义的精神教育年青一代的教育方针。
    现在，匈牙利和罗马尼亚的新学制规定国民教育期限为八年。捷克斯洛伐克实行九年制，波兰和保加利亚则实行十一年制的国民教育。
    各人民民主国家都大量扩充及修建了学校，以解决广大的工农子弟的就学问题。解放之后，罗马尼亚的小学生已增加了二十四倍，中学生增加了七倍；阿尔巴尼亚的小学生增加了两倍半；波兰的农民子弟进入中小学的人数增加了两倍；保加利亚的中小学生增加了百分之五十；匈牙利几乎全部学龄儿童都已就学。
    各人民民主国家都大力推行了使工农青年的就学及接受高等教育的工作。捷克斯洛伐克专门设立了十二个工农中学，罗马尼亚专门设立了三所工农速成中学，十三所高级技术训练学校，匈牙利的工农中学学生达二万二千人。各国的大学都在大量招收突击工人入学，保加利亚的各大学都为工人设立了特别班，在匈牙利就有三万八千名工农青年由国家负担着全部学习费用。
    各人民民主国家在大力发展正规教育之际，同时通过识字班和文化之家等方式，进行扫除文盲和提高劳动人民文化的工作。在阿尔巴尼亚，八十多万文盲中已有二十万学会了读和写。在罗马尼亚的四百二十万文盲中，仅在去年和今年，学会读和写的就有一百一十万人。波兰的文盲则将在一九五一年全部肃清。
