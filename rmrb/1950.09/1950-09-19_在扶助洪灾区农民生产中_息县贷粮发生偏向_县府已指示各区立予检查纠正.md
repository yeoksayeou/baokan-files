　　In Supporting Flood-stricken Farmers in Production,
    Xixian County’s Grain Loans Showed Bias
    County Government Instructed All Districts to Immediately Inspect and Correct
    [Our Dispatch] In Henan Province, Xixian County, the issuance of grain and loans to support the masses in flood-stricken areas in production has been seriously biased. The county government has instructed all district and township governments to conduct inspections quickly and correct the issues. After the floods in the county, in order to promptly assist disaster victims in overcoming the disaster and solve the farmers' seed difficulties, 350,000 jin of seed grain and 270 million yuan in seed loans were distributed. After the county government distributed the resources to the districts based on the severity of the disaster in each district, some districts, according to the loan conditions, after democratic discussion, directly distributed the grain and funds to villages or households; other districts distributed them level by level, resulting in the following biases: First, cadres took over and did everything, without democratic discussion, relying on personal feelings and favoritism to lend to relatives and friends. Second, failing to follow the conditions and fearing trouble, they distributed them equally, resulting in a general sprinkling of rain with little effect; some simply ate the loaned grain themselves. Third, fearing that poor farmers would not be able to repay the loans, they lent them to middle peasants and above, seriously violating the loan principles and showing no mass viewpoint. Fourth, cadres lent more, the masses lent less; some even distributed a portion and kept a portion to embezzle for their own benefit. After learning about these practices, which were severely divorced from the masses, the Special Commissioner's Office called on mobilizing the masses to expose incidents of cadre corruption and correct the existing biases; the county government also instructed all districts again to conduct thorough inspections quickly and report the inspection results to the county government.

　　在扶助洪灾区农民生产中
    息县贷粮发生偏向
    县府已指示各区立予检查纠正
    【本报讯】河南省息县在扶助洪灾区群众生产中，贷粮贷款发生严重偏向，县府已指示各区乡政府迅速进行检查，予以纠正。该县在洪灾之后，为及时扶助灾民战胜灾荒，解决农民种子困难，曾发放种子粮三十五万斤，种子贷款二亿七千万元。县府根据各区受灾情况分配到区后，有的区根据贷款条件，经过了民主评议，把粮款直接分配到村或户；有的区却按级分配，结果便产生了如下几种偏向：一、干部包办代替，不经民主评议，凭感情拉拢，贷给了亲朋好友。二、不按条件，怕麻烦，平均分配，以致形成普降小雨，作用不大；有的干脆就把贷粮吃掉了。三、怕贫苦农民还不起，便把贷款贷给中农以上成份，严重违反了贷款原则，毫无群众观点。四、干部多贷，群众少贷；还有的分配一部分，留下一部分贪污自肥。这些严重脱离群众的做法，专署得知后，曾经号召发动群众，检举干部贪污事件，纠正已出偏向；县府亦再次指示各区迅即切实深入检查，并将检查结果向县府汇报。
