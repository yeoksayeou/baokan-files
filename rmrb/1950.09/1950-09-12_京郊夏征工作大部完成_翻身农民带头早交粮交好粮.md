　　Beijing News Agency Report: The summer grain collection work in the suburbs of Beijing was mostly completed by the end of August. The total amount of public grain collected in the entire suburban area reached 85.4% of the summer collection task. Among them, Districts 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 have all completed their tasks and mostly exceeded them. District 10 completed 75%, and District 11 completed 72%.

　　This summer collection was to collect the remaining arrears of the autumn public grain from last year. In order to take care of this year's disaster situation, the Beijing Municipal People's Government reduced the amount of grain to be collected this time to 3,855,446 jin, accounting for 14% of the total summer wheat production of 26,966,000 jin (the task assigned last autumn accounted for more than 20% of the total crop production), greatly reducing the burden on farmers.

　　During this collection, each district generally did not change the remaining arrears task from last autumn, not adding to the light ones, and reducing or exempting the heavy ones. Therefore, assessment of reduction and exemption was an important part of this collection work. During the collection, democratic evaluation was carried out from district to village to household, and reductions and exemptions were made based on facts, making the burden fair and reasonable and in line with reality. The masses responded very well. After delivering grain, the masses in Bajiao Village, District 15, said happily: "When the Kuomintang was in power, they tied people up and beat them, cursed from house to house with sacks, but it didn't work. This year, it was completed in two days." The villagers of Sihe Village, the most severely affected by the disaster in the district, were happy to hear the news of the reduction and exemption of public grain and said: "The government takes care of us so much, we must hand it in this time!" Some districts also conducted in-depth publicity of policies among the masses, mobilizing the masses to deliver grain through various village farmers' associations, party,团, women's organizations, etc. Activists in various organizations, especially emancipated peasants and women, guaranteed to take the lead in delivering grain early and delivering good grain, creating a upsurge in grain delivery. District 15 completely stored the allocated grain in four days. Liuniangfu Village delivered all the public grain within four hours after the collection began, and more than 20,000 jin of new wheat were delivered to the city granary that night. However, some shortcomings and biases also occurred in the work: First, the work was arranged more than a month after the wheat harvest, which was a bit late, and the farmers did not have much wheat left; after the collection began, heavy rains caused disasters, and cadres were busy leading the construction of dikes and drainage, and their energy was dispersed. In addition, at the beginning of the collection work, some districts did not implement the policy of reduction and exemption, fearing that the task could not be completed, and did not openly announce the reduction and exemption to the masses, but kept the amount of reduction and exemption in the district, and still collected according to the original arrears. Therefore, some people reflected: This is "whipping the fast ox, and the honest and active ones who hand in early suffer." Some people waited and delayed, waiting for reduction and exemption. Households with more arrears were even more reluctant to pay, holding the attitude that "more debts are not worrying, and more lice don't bite." Some cadres believed that collecting public grain was asking the masses for things, and felt that "collecting grain is not as good as land reform," and it was not easy to mobilize the masses. Therefore, they always wanted the higher authorities to reduce and exempt more, and were unwilling to carry out mass work; some individual villages also had serious cases of coercion and command, such as Dawangjing Village in the northern suburbs forcing the landlords and rich peasants who owed public grain before the land reform to stand in the sun, only allowing them to leave when they came up with a solution. These biases have been promptly corrected by most districts and villages, thus quickly and properly completing the task.

### 京郊夏征工作大部完成  翻身农民带头早交粮交好粮

　　京郊夏征工作大部完成
    翻身农民带头早交粮交好粮
    【京市新闻处讯】京郊夏征公粮工作已于八月底大部完成，全郊区共征集公粮达今夏应征任务的百分之八十五·四。其中十二、十三、十四、十五、十六等五个区全部完成，且大都超过任务，十区完成百分之七十五，十一区完成百分之七十二。
    这次夏征是征收去年秋季公粮的尾欠，京市人民政府为了照顾今年的灾情，又将这次应征粮额减为三百八十五万五千四百四十六斤，占今夏小麦总产量二千六百九十六万六千斤的百分之十四（去秋分配任务约占农作物总产量的百分之二十以上），大大地减轻了农民的负担。
    这次征收时，各区根据去秋尾欠任务一般地不加变动，轻的不加，重的减免，因此，评定减、免是这次征收工作中的一个重要环节，征收中，由区到村、到户大都进行了民主评议，据实减免，使负担公平合理，切合实际，群众反映很好。十五区八角村群众交粮后愉快地说：“国民党在时，又是捆，又是打，拿着口袋挨家骂，也不行，今年两天就齐了。”该区灾情最重的四合村，听到减免公粮的消息后，大家高兴地说：“政府这样照顾咱，这回一定得交齐！”有些区并在群众中深入地宣传了政策，通过各村农会、党、团、妇女等组织动员群众交粮。各个组织中的积极分子，尤其是翻身农民和妇女都保证带头早交粮，交好粮，造成了交粮热潮。十五区全部分粮四天入库，刘娘府村在开征后四个钟头内公粮全部送齐，当晚两万多斤新麦就送达市内粮库。但在工作中也发生一些缺点和偏向：首先，工作布置在麦收一月以后，为时稍晚，农民存麦已不多；开征后又遇大雨成灾，干部忙于领导堵堤排水，精力分散，加以征收工作开始时，有的区没有贯彻执行减免政策，只怕任务完成不了，不向群众公开宣布减免，只将减免数额掌握在区，仍按原尾欠数照征，因此部分群众反映：这是“鞭打快牛，老实积极先交了的吃亏。”有些人就观望拖延，等候减免。尾欠多的户更抱着“账多了不愁，虱子多了不咬”的态度拖着不交。有些干部认为征公粮是向群众要东西，觉得“征粮不比土改”，不好发动群众，因之，总想上级多减多免，不愿进行群众工作；也有个别村子发生严重的强迫命令现象，如北郊大望京村逼征土地改革以前的地主和富农所欠公粮，令他们在太阳地里站着，想出办法才许走。这些偏向，大部分的区、村都已及时纠正，因而迅速妥善地完成了任务。
