Dong Cunrui, a People's Hero of a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army, heroically sacrificed his life in the Battle of Longhua in order to blast the enemy's碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox); he held the explosive pack in his left hand, pulled the fuse with his right hand, and perished together with the enemy, ensuring that our army quickly broke into Longhua City and victoriously ended the battle. Comrade Zhi Shunyi, a combat hero who cooperated with Comrade Dong Cunrui at the time, was elected as a representative to the National Combat Heroes Conference. This article is a record of their combat situation at that time.

I.

　　Spring of 1948, in Rehe.

　　The Sixth Company of a certain regiment of the artillery division, after finishing the Er Gou battle, concentrated in Tou Gou for a day of rest, and held a mass meeting outside the village. At the meeting, an old woman, about fifty years old with gray hair, held the hands of a soldier and denounced the atrocities of the Kuomintang bandit army. When she spoke of her husband being tied up and killed by the bandit army for leading the way for our army, she was already crying and unable to speak. She stretched out her withered hands and cried:

　　"Justice! Justice! Avenge the hatred for us!"

　　The soldiers all lowered their heads as they listened. Dong Cunrui, the leader of the Sixth Squad, jumped out of the ranks, his face flushed, his eyes wide, and he shook his fist and said:

　　"Avenge! We must avenge!"

　　"Resolutely avenge the old woman!" Zhi Shunyi, the leader of the Seventh Squad, also jumped up.

　　"Poor people all over the world are one family, avenge!" The soldiers in the ranks shouted in unison, their voices like thunder.

　　That night, the troops set off, heading straight for Longhua City, north of Chengde. The soldiers, with a determined heart to avenge, prepared to meet this fierce battle.

II.

　　The troops marched eighty *li* (里 - approximately half a kilometer) overnight and arrived in a small mountain gully five *li* northeast of the city. The sky was just beginning to be faintly bright. The soldiers put down their backpacks and began digging fortifications, doing it in one breath for five days.

　　Dong Cunrui ran to the company headquarters several times a day, opening his mouth with no other words but a firm request for the blasting mission. He said:

　　"Give me the blasting mission. After listening to the old woman, I thought of my own suffering..."

　　The instructor patted him on the shoulder with emotion and said:

　　"Don't worry! The arduous task will definitely be given to you!"

　　"Instructor! You can rest assured too. If there is difficulty and the task is not completed, I will never come back to see the company commander!"

　　He walked out of the company headquarters with his chest out.

　　In the evening, the company held a mobilization meeting. The company commander stood in front of the soldiers and said excitedly:

　　"Comrades! We are going to start work tomorrow!"

　　There was a burst of applause in the ranks, and everyone shouted:

　　"Let's do it! We're waiting for it!"

　　The company commander waved to everyone and said:

　　"Our task is to break through from the periphery and take down Longhua Middle School..."

　　Before the company commander finished speaking, Dong Cunrui jumped up first. He shouted:

　　"The blasting team is mine, I'll lead the way!"

　　Zhi Shunyi also jumped up and volunteered to be the assault team.

III.

　　The next morning, the sun, through a layer of hazy mist, gently brushed the wheat that was more than a foot tall in the field. The soldiers were busily eating breakfast. At this time, the signal flare shot through the mist like a petrel, straight into the clouds, followed by the booming sound of artillery.

　　"It's started!"

　　"It's on!"

　　"Quick, go fight the enemy!"

　　The soldiers shouted excitedly, hurriedly threw down their rice bowls, and took only weapons, ammunition, and explosive packs. The whistle for assembly blew sharply, and the soldiers skillfully jumped out of the gully and entered the communication trench they had built for five days and five nights, passing through more than 100 meters of open ground.

　　The battle began like this. The artillery shook Longhua City with booming sounds, and the machine gun fire stirred up a layer of soil. The company commander, instructor, and platoon leaders observed the enemy situation and returned, issuing orders one after another:

　　"Each group be prepared!"

　　"Explosives!"

　　"Machine guns, fire!"

　　"Blasting team! Assault team!"

　　"Here!" Dong Cunrui and Zhi Shunyi answered loudly together.

　　"Forward! Go!"

　　They glanced at each other, and each told the comrades in the group: "Get ready! Go!" Zhi Shunyi carried two pockets of grenades and led the assault team to the front to clear the way for the blasting team.

　　Dong Cunrui also led the blasting team, holding the explosive packs, closely following behind the assault team.

　　The enemy's machine guns fired fiercely, sealing off the advance road so tightly that no wind or rain could pass through. Zhi Shunyi waved a small red flag, followed by throwing two grenades, and there was a puff of thick smoke. Dong Cunrui held the explosive pack and plunged into the thick smoke, and the other two comrades of the blasting team also followed.

　　In front of them were four small blockhouses. The enemy machine guns fired like the tongues of poisonous snakes. They moved to a place only dozens of meters away from the blockhouses. A team member named Zhang Youcai was sacrificed. Dong Cunrui called out to him: "Squad Leader!" He didn't stop for a step, gritted his teeth and rushed up, and a package of explosives solved a central blockhouse of the enemy. Another team member, Li Zhende, was a soldier from the Ninth Squad, and also closely followed and blew up the enemy's left blockhouse. Zhi Shunyi's assault team continuously threw grenades at the enemy's position, and the fire, smoke, and explosions turned the battlefield into a sea of ​​fire. Under his cover, Dong Cunrui blew up two more blockhouses in a row.

　　The enemy's forward positions were cleared, and the troops rushed up like a whirlwind.

　　The enemy's machine guns fired from the large碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox), passing through a trench more than ten feet wide and a dense barbed wire, controlling a stretch of open ground in front.

　　The company commander gave an order to the first platoon leader, saying:

　　"Send a group to blast the large碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox)!"

　　The blasting team of the first platoon did not pass through the fire net of the enemy's five machine guns firing crisscross, sacrificing one and wounding two. Dong Cunrui and Zhi Shunyi crawled to the instructor:

　　"Give us the task!"

　　"Your task is completed!"

　　"It's not completed! See? One was sacrificed, and two were wounded!"

　　New hatred and old hatred impacted them, and they shouted loudly to the instructor, and the instructor gave them the task again.

　　"Go!" Dong Cunrui turned his head and said to Zhi Shunyi.

　　Zhi Shunyi put on two more pockets of grenades, stuck the small red flag on his back, and said:

　　"If we don't complete the task, we won't come back!"

　　Dong Cunrui rolled over to the left, squatted on the ground like a big male cat, staring ahead with a pair of hateful eyes, as if he was about to pounce on it immediately. He said:

　　"If I am injured or sacrificed halfway..."

　　"I will resolutely complete the task for you!"

　　"Right!"

　　Dong Cunrui shrugged and rushed out again from the thick smoke of Zhi Shunyi's grenades.

IV.

　　The two climbed behind the ridge line of the earthen slope, observing the road ahead and the enemy's defense deployment:

　　Behind the barbed wire, the trench of more than one and a half *zhang* (丈 - approximately 3.3 meters) wide was eight or nine *chi* (尺 - approximately 0.33 meters) deep, hindering their advance. Behind the trench was a bridge more than one *zhang* long. There was a碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox) at the head of the bridge, firing sideways at each other in a crisscross pattern. The bridge was covered with brick-built trenches, and behind the trenches was a large碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox). This碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox) was riding in the middle of the wall of Longhua Middle School, and three machine guns supported the碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox) in front.

　　"Blow up the bridge!"

　　"Isolate the two碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox)!"

　　They both thought so, otherwise they could not move forward and could not take down Longhua Middle School.

　　Shells were exploding, and the sound of cannons roared deafeningly. Dong Cunrui carried two packs of explosives and moved forward. Zhi Shunyi rushed to the front of him with a pack of explosives. He drilled under the barbed wire, gritted his teeth and lifted the barbed wire with his back. Machine gun bullets passed over their heads like the wind, making a sharp whistling sound. Zhi Shunyi passed through the barbed wire and placed the explosive pack on the edge of the trench, and took a step back. With a bang, the trench collapsed. The earth filled the trench, Dong Cunrui dashed over and rushed straight to the dead corner of the碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox)'s firepower.

　　Wearing cotton military uniforms, both of them were covered in sweat. Zhi Shunyi didn't bother to wipe it and threw grenades into the碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox) at the head of the bridge. Explosions followed explosions, the machine gun in the碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox) went silent, and the machine guns in Longhua Middle School fired frantically, supporting the dying remnants of bandits in the碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox) in front and retreating to the communication trench on the bridge.

　　Dong Cunrui, holding the explosives, clung to the bridge edge and detoured under the bridge. The bridge was four or five *chi* high, and placing the explosives on the ground to blow them up would not have any effect. He gritted his teeth, held the explosive pack with his left hand, tilted his head to the left, and vigorously pulled the fuse with his right hand.

　　"Boom!"

　　The battlefield was deadly silent. Zhi Shunyi jumped to the bottom of the bridge. Only half of Dong Cunrui's heroic body remained, lying in a pool of blood.

　　After a few seconds of silence, Zhi Shunyi looked at Dong Cunrui and said:

　　"Your task is completed, I will complete the rest, rest assured!"

　　He picked up the remaining pack of explosives from Dong Cunrui from the ground and said to the comrades in the group:

　　"Dong Cunrui sacrificed himself, all for the people!"

　　"Avenge him!"

　　"Avenge Squad Leader!"

　　Zhi Shunyi rushed to the foot of the school's wall, disregarding everything. The heat wave of the mortar shell explosions rushed to his face like fire. He used the explosive pack that Dong Cunrui had left him to blow up the enemy's last碉堡 (Diāobǎo -碉堡 means bunker or pillbox) and blew open the wall.

　　He shouted: "Avenge Dong Cunrui! Charge!"

　　He led the assault team into the wall, and grenades exploded in the school yard.

　　The troops rushed up with shouts of "Charge" and "Kill". More than 130 remnants of bandits in the school obediently laid down their guns under Zhi Shunyi's shout of "Hand over your guns and you will not be killed."

　　Dong Cunrui's red flag was planted on Longhua Middle School by Zhi Shunyi.

　　The Longhua battle ended, followed by the Changli battle, the Shangzhuangtuo battle, and a series of battles. Zhi Shunyi always had the determination to avenge Dong Cunrui, shouting the slogan "Avenge Dong Cunrui", and threw himself into the battle, achieving victory every time.

　　Battle, victory, victory, battle... Zhi Shunyi bravely held Dong Cunrui's battle flag and walked to this day, making four major contributions and four minor contributions to the people in battle. The night before he went to Beijing to attend the National Combat Heroes Conference, wearing a Mao Zedong Medal, three Bravery Medals and a Hardship Medal issued by the Fourth Field Army, he said to his comrades:

　　"Dong Cunrui! I will never forget him in my life. Every time I perform difficult tasks, as long as I think of him, strength is added to my whole body." (Attached picture)

　　董存瑞的战友——郅顺义
    王戎
    四野某部人民英雄董存瑞，在隆化战斗中，为了爆破敌人的碉堡，不惜英勇地牺牲自己的生命，左手托炸药包，右手拉导火线，与敌人同归于尽，保证了我军迅速突入隆化城，胜利地结束战斗。当时与董存瑞同志配合作战的战斗英雄郅顺义同志，此次当选为全国战斗英雄代表会议的代表，本文就是追记他们当时的战斗情形。
  一
    一九四八年春天，在热河。
    炮兵师某团六连，打完二沟战斗，集中在头沟休息一天，在村外召集了一个群众会。大会上，一个年纪约五十多，花白头发的老大娘，拉着战士的手，控诉国民党匪军的暴行，说到她丈夫为给我军带路，而被匪军捆去杀死的时候，已是哭得讲不出话了，他伸出一双干枯了的手叫着：
    “伸冤啊！伸冤啊！仇靠你们报啊！”
    战士们都听得低下了头，六班长董存瑞从队伍里跳起来，脸通红，瞪着眼，摇幌一下拳头，说：
    “报仇！一定要报仇！”
    “坚决给大娘报仇！”七班长郅顺义也跳了起来。
    “天下穷人是一家，报仇！”队伍里的战士们齐声地叫着，声音像打雷。
    当天晚上，队伍就出发了，直奔承德以北的隆化城，战士们怀着一颗坚决报仇的心，准备着迎接这一次激烈的战斗。
  二
    部队一夜走了八十里，到了城东北角五里地的小山沟里，天刚有点朦朦亮，战士们放下背包就动手挖工事，一口气就干了五天。
    董存瑞一天好几趟跑到连部去，张嘴没二话，坚决要求爆破任务，他说：
    “把爆破任务给我吧，听了老大娘的话，想起了自己的苦……”
    指导员感动地拍着他的肩膀，说：
    “放心！艰巨任务一定给你！”
    “指导员！你也放心，那困难到那儿，完不成任务，决计不回来见连首长！”
    他挺着胸脯走出连部。
    傍晚，连里召开动员会，连首长站在战士面前，激动地说：
    “同志们！咱们明天就要动手干啦！”
    队伍里哗的一阵掌声，大家都叫着：
    “干吧！咱等着呢！”
    连长向大家挥挥手，说：
    “咱们的任务，是从外围突破进去，拿下隆化中学……”
    连长的话还没说完，董存瑞头一个跳起来，他嚷着：
    “爆破组是我的，我领头！”
    郅顺义也跳了起来，报名担任突击组。
  三
    第二天早上，太阳透过一层蒙蒙的雾，轻拂着地里一尺多高的小麦，战士们正忙乱地吃早饭。这时，信号弹像海燕样地穿过薄雾，直钻到云霄里，紧跟着是大炮轰轰隆隆的响成一片。
    “开始啦！”
    “干起来啦！”
    “快，打敌人去！”
    战士们激动地叫着，忙乱的扔下饭碗，除了武器、弹药、炸药包以外，什么都没有带，集合出发的哨子呜呜叫，战士们机动地跃出山沟，通过一百多公尺的开阔地，进入了他们构筑了五天五夜的交通沟。
    战斗就这样开始了，大炮轰轰的摇幌着隆化城，机枪的射击把泥土掀起了一层。连长，指导员，和排长们观察敌情回来，纷纷地下达命令：
    “各小组准备好！”
    “炸药！”
    “机枪，打！”
    “爆破组！突击组！”
    “在这儿！”董存瑞和郅顺义一块大声地答应着。
    “前进！上！”
    他们俩互相瞅了一眼，各人对组里的同志说了声：“准备好！上！”郅顺义背起两兜手榴弹，带着突击组冲到前面去给爆破组开路了。
    董存瑞也带着爆破组，抱着炸药包，紧跟在突击组的后面。
    敌人的机枪咯咯咯地扫射着，前进道路被封锁的风雨不透，郅顺义摇动了一下小红旗，跟着就打出两个手榴弹，轰的一股浓烟。董存瑞抱着炸药包钻到浓烟里，爆破组其余两个同志也跟了上去。
    前面横着四个小炮楼，敌人机枪打得像毒蛇的舌头，他们运动到离炮楼只有几十公尺的地方，一个叫张有才的组员牺牲了，董存瑞叫了他一声：“八班长！”他一步也没停，咬着牙冲了上去，一包炸药解决了敌人中央的一个炮楼。另一个组员李振德，是九班的战士，也紧跟着扑上去，炸掉敌人左翼的炮楼。郅顺义的突击组连续地向敌人阵地上投掷手榴弹，火、浓烟、爆破声，把战场打成一片火海，董存瑞在他的掩护下，一连又轰掉两个炮楼。
    敌人前沿阵地肃清了，队伍像阵旋风冲上来。
    敌人的机枪，从大碉堡向外射击，穿过一道一丈来宽的壕沟，穿过一道密密的铁丝网，控制着前面一片开阔地。
    连长给一排长命令说：
    “派一个组爆破大碉堡！”
    一排的爆破组，没有通过敌人五挺机枪交叉射击的火网，牺牲了一个，打伤了两个。董存瑞和郅顺义匍匐前进到指导员跟前：
    “把任务给我们！”
    “你们的任务完成了！”
    “没有完成呀！看见没有？牺牲了一个，打伤了两个！”
    新仇旧恨冲击着，他们大声对指导员嚷着，指导员又把任务给了他们。
    “走！”董存瑞回头对郅顺义说。
    郅顺义又背上两兜子手榴弹，把小红旗插在背后，说：
    “完不成任务，咱们不回来！”
    董存瑞翻身向左边滚了过去，像只大雄猫似的嗖的蹲在地上，他瞪着一对仇恨的眼望着前方，像要马上扑过去，他说：
    “要是我半道上打伤了，或者是牺牲了……”
    “我坚决替你完成任务！”
    “对！”
    董存瑞一耸身，又从郅顺义打出的手榴弹的浓烟里窜了出去。
  四
    两人爬在土坡的棱线背后，观察前进道路，观察敌人的防御配备：
    铁丝网后面，那一丈半宽的壕沟，有八、九尺深，阻碍着他们前进。壕沟后面，是一道一丈来长的桥，桥头有个碉堡，正互相交叉地侧射着。桥上用砖垒成了盖沟，沟后面又是一个大碉堡，这个碉堡，骑在隆化中学的围墙中间，三挺机枪支援着前面的碉堡。
    “把桥炸断！”
    “把两个碉堡孤立起来！”
    他们俩都这么想，不如此就无法前进，无法拿下隆化中学。
    炮弹在爆炸，炮声震耳的轰隆隆咆哮着，董存瑞背起两包炸药向前运动。郅顺义抱着一包炸药窜到他前面，他钻到铁丝网底下，咬着牙用背脊把铁丝网掀了起来，机枪子弹像风一样从他们头顶穿过去，发出尖锐的哨声。郅顺义通过铁丝网，把炸药包安放在壕沟的边沿上，往后退了一步。轰的一声，壕沟被崩坍了。土填平在壕沟里，董存瑞一个箭步窜过去，直扑到碉堡火力的死角里。
    穿着棉军服，两人满头是汗，郅顺义也顾不得擦，朝桥头碉堡里扔手榴弹，爆炸紧接着爆炸，碉堡里的机枪哑了，隆化中学里的机枪，疯狂地射击着，支援着前面碉堡快死的残匪，向桥上的交通沟撤退。
    董存瑞抱着炸药，紧贴着桥沿迂回到桥下，桥身有四、五尺高，把炸药放在地上炸，不会发生作用，他咬着牙，用左手托住炸药包，头向左边一偏，右手用力地拉动了导火线。
    “轰！”
    战地一片死沉的寂静，郅顺义纵身窜到桥下，董存瑞只剩下半截英雄的身躯倒卧在血泊里。
    几秒钟的默哀，郅顺义望着董存瑞说：
    “你的任务完成了，剩下的我完成，你放心！”
    他从地上抱起董存瑞剩下的一包炸药，对组里的同志说：
    “董存瑞牺牲了，全为了人民大众！”
    “给他报仇！”
    “给六班长报仇！”
    郅顺义不顾一切的冲到学校的围墙脚下，迫击炮弹爆炸的热浪像火一样往他脸上扑，他用董存瑞给他留下的炸药包，轰坍了敌人最后的一个碉堡，炸开了围墙。
    他嚷着：“给董存瑞报仇呀！冲呀！”
    他带着突击组冲进了围墙，手榴弹在学校的院子里响成一片。
    队伍在“冲呀”、“杀呀”的喊声里冲了上来，学校里一百三十多个残匪，在郅顺义“交枪不杀”的喊话下，乖乖地放下了他们的枪。
    董存瑞的红旗，被郅顺义插上隆化中学。
    隆化战斗结束了，紧接着就是昌黎战斗、上庄坨战斗，一连串的战斗，郅顺义都怀着给董存瑞报仇的决心，喊着“给董存瑞报仇”的口号，把自己投掷在战斗里，每次都取得了胜利。
    战斗、胜利、胜利、战斗……郅顺义骁勇地执着董存瑞这面战旗，走到今天，为人民在战斗中立了四大功和四小功，当他挂着四野发的一颗毛泽东奖章、三个勇敢奖章和一个艰苦奖章到北京出席全国战斗英雄代表会议的前夜，他对他的同志说：
    “董存瑞！我一辈子也忘不了他，我每次执行艰巨任务的时候，只要想起他，浑身就增加了力量。”（附图片）
