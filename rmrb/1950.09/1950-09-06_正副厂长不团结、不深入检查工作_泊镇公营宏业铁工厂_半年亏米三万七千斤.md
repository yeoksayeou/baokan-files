　　The Factory Director and Deputy Factory Director Are Not United and Fail to Conduct In-Depth Work Inspections
    Bo Town Public Hongye Iron Factory
    Loses 37,000 Catties of Rice in Six Months
    The public Hongye Iron Factory in Bo Town, Hebei Province, lost 37,618 catties of rice in six months because the leadership lacked a clear understanding of how to manage state-owned enterprises responsibly and, at the same time, the factory director and deputy factory director disagreed, leading to relaxed leadership.
    Factory Director Cui Changfeng and Deputy Factory Director Zhang Enbo looked down on each other, each acting independently and refusing to obey the other. For example, once, at a factory management committee meeting, the deputy factory director proposed: "The factory's organization is too large and the funds are too small, so it should be reduced." But the factory director proposed: "More people make more money, which has nothing to do with the amount of funds." And he said angrily: "If you follow my opinion, I, the factory director, will be responsible for the loss of money, and you don't have to worry about it!" The worker representatives who attended the meeting did not dare to express their opinions boldly after seeing this situation, and secretly discussed: "If the leading cadres first disagree, how can production be improved!"
    At the same time, they lacked in-depth inspections of their work. In order to rush to produce 300 waterwheels, the factory hired private blacksmith shops to make ear handles. Because they were not inspected in time, most of the 2,500 catties of raw materials were damaged. The cost of raw materials alone was a loss of 8,750 catties of rice. In the production of waterwheels, due to insufficient in-depth research on the technical aspects, the flat wheels of the waterwheels produced were too large, and the gaps between the vertical wheel teeth were too small. Therefore, the masses were very dissatisfied, and the factory had to add materials to repair them. A total of 369 repair workers were used (9 catties of rice per worker), which was equivalent to 3,321 catties of rice; the loss of coke was 3,995 catties, which was equivalent to 998 catties and 12 taels of rice.
    The leadership did not have a clear understanding of the idea of relying on the masses of workers to improve production. When formulating production plans, they did not adopt the approach of "from the masses, to the masses," but instead, Director Cui blindly formulated the plans himself. Therefore, when the factory management committee discussed the plan, some workers reflected: "The factory director has already figured it out, what's the use of asking us to discuss it? It's still based on his plan."
    The factory director and deputy factory director only fought over personal opinions and did not work hard on production, which caused significant losses to the factory, and they should conduct a profound self-criticism.

　　正副厂长不团结、不深入检查工作
    泊镇公营宏业铁工厂
    半年亏米三万七千斤
    河北省泊镇公营宏业铁工厂，因领导上缺乏认真负责地把国家企业管理好的明确思想，同时因正副厂长闹意见，放松了领导，半年赔米三万七千六百十八斤。
    厂长崔昌凤和副厂长张恩波两人，互相瞧不起，各自为政，谁也不服谁。譬如，有一次，在工厂管理委员会的会议上，副厂长提出：“厂内组织庞大，资金太少，应该缩减一下。”而厂长却提出：“人多多赚钱，与资金大小没关系。”并气愤地说：“要是依我这意见，赔了钱，由我厂长负责，你别管！”参加会议的工人代表看了这种情况，也就不敢大胆提意见了，背地里都议论说：“领导干部先闹不团结，生产能搞好嘛！”
    同时他们对工作缺乏深入检查。该厂为了赶制三百辆水车，雇了私人铁匠炉给打耳把子。因为没有及时检查，结果把二千五百斤原料绝大部分给打坏了。光是原料钱就损失米八千七百五十斤。在水车生产上，由于技术方面深入钻研不够，所出的水车平轮太大，立轮牙空小，每次上水太多，弱牲口拉不动。因此群众很不满意，该厂只得重新添料修理。计用了修理工三百六十九个（每工九斤米），折米三千三百二十一斤；损失焦炭三千九百九十五斤，折米九百九十八斤十二两。
    领导上对依靠工人群众搞好生产的思想不明确。订生产计划时，不是采取从群众中来再到群众中去的方针，而是由崔厂长自己盲目订出。因此在工厂管理委员会讨论计划时，有的工人便反映说：“厂长早就琢磨好了，叫咱们讨论有啥用，还不是按他那一套。”
    该厂正副厂长这样只闹个人意见，不努力生产，以致造成该厂重大损失，应该进行深刻检讨。
