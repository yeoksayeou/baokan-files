People's Hero Li Guoying
——An Introduction to Delegates to the National Combat Heroes Conference

	Comrade Li Guoying, a Special Class Meritorious Individual, is a Communist Party member and currently serves as the battalion commander of the Third Battalion of a certain regiment of a certain division of a certain army of the North China Military Region. He is 31 years old and was born into a poor peasant family in Nanbao Village, Anguo County, Hebei Province. At the age of twenty, unable to endure the oppression of landlords and the bullying of the Japanese devils, he resolutely left his hometown and joined the 17th Regiment of the Jizhong Military Region. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, he was successively incorporated into local brigades and field armies, and successively promoted to platoon leader, company commander, and battalion commander. Over the past ten years, he has experienced more than seventy battles of all sizes, been wounded eight times, and personally captured weapons including one cannon, four heavy machine guns, four light machine guns, and more than forty rifles, and captured more than a hundred enemies. In 1946, he was awarded the glorious title of First Class Combat Hero at the Brigade's Hero and Model Conference, and then repeatedly performed meritorious deeds, earning a special class merit and two major merits, becoming an outstanding combat hero.

	His characteristics: bravery, careful planning, and skill in seizing combat opportunities.

	He won the title of First Class Combat Hero of the entire brigade in the second half of 1946, when he was a platoon leader. During this half year, he participated in every battle of the regiment, each time showing unparalleled bravery, capturing many things, and achieving great victories. The most special of these were the battles of Suncun and Caohe in the Baobei Campaign.

	Suncun was the first strongly fortified stronghold of the enemy east of Baoding. After dawn on November 3, the Third Company blew up the rooms on the west side of the blockhouse. Taking advantage of the smoke and dust, he led his entire platoon quickly across the deep ditch and charged in. However, after passing through several courtyards, they were faced with a large ditch five feet wide and fifteen feet deep. Across the ditch stood a large five-zhang-high blockhouse, and machine guns on the blockhouse were firing at them like popping beans. He vigilantly lay down along the edge of the ditch, and while the main force used firepower to block the enemy gun ports, he threw two grenades in succession. After the smoke and dust rose, he jumped up and shouted, "Second Platoon, follow me!" and rushed towards the drawbridge entrance. Seeing his fierce attack, the enemy panicked and fled to the southwest, attempting to break through, but was intercepted by our other troops and had to return to the blockhouse. At this time, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness, he quickly charged into the blockhouse with his gun and bayonet fixed, shouting, "Hand over your guns quickly, and your lives will be spared!" The enemy was so frightened that they threw their machine guns and rifles on the ground.

	In the first battle of Caohe, they were responsible for attacking the western bunker. Initially, his charge with the Sixth Squad was repulsed, so he requested permission to organize another assault, but without the approval of his superiors. As it was getting dark, he crawled around the pillbox, repeatedly scouting the terrain and selecting an assault route, without sleeping all night. As dawn approached, he repeatedly requested, declaring that he would guarantee the completion of the mission. After the superiors gave permission, he quickly selected a squad from his entire platoon and led them secretly around to the enemy's flank. Then, he personally led three people through the trench and placed mines against the base of the tower. The enemy was completely unaware, and when the explosion sounded, the battle was quickly resolved.

	In February 1947, in the second attack on Caohe, he had been promoted to deputy company commander of the regiment's Third Company. He first gathered the soldiers to explain the task of storming the fortified position, and ordered the First Platoon to charge in the front, with him following behind. When they reached the large ditch in front of the blockhouse, the enemy's firepower was too intense, so he called up two more machine guns to block the enemy gun ports. Under the dense fire cover, they seized the bunker at the head of the ditch, and he threw a grenade into the gun port, resulting in the annihilation of an entire enemy company. Comrade Li Guoying captured a mortar and was awarded a major merit after the battle.

	With the development of the victorious situation, the troops were reorganized into field armies in early 1947. At the end of May, the troops set off for Cangxian County, preparing to launch the Qingcang Campaign. At this time, he was ill, and his superiors suggested that he be hospitalized for recuperation, but he resolutely refused, saying, "Even if I have to take a cart, I must participate in the battle." By the time he arrived at the destination, his illness had just improved. Hearing that the regiment's task was to attack Cangxian City, he ignored his illness and took the initiative to consult with the company commander, submitting a written request to the battalion and regimental leaders to take the main attack; and swore to guarantee the completion of all tasks.

	After the superiors approved, he spent the whole day in the Third Platoon, which was responsible for the main attack, specifically helping to form combat teams and study actions. After the Second Battalion cleared the peripheral enemies, he led the soldiers to the vicinity of the West Gate of Cangxian County. He personally went with a messenger to scout the terrain, selected the breakthrough point, and crawled into the doorways of the civilian houses in front of the city to observe the location of the blockhouses, measure the height of the city wall, and the width and depth of the moat. He looked once, afraid it wouldn't be accurate, and looked three times in a row, then came back and told the platoon leaders to crawl over and look as well. He observed repeatedly as many as thirteen times. He didn't sleep all night, specifically guiding the breaching of the wall, checking equipment, and carrying the scaling ladders to the vicinity of the city.

	At dusk, with the sound of fierce artillery fire, amidst a raging storm of wind and rain, and thunder and lightning, the general attack began! He was the first to rush out, and the troops followed closely behind. At this time, the enemy tried their best to block the advance with their firepower, but under his brave and resourceful command, two soldiers were the first to climb the city wall, and he followed in third place. After getting on the city wall, he immediately captured a light machine gun. He used the captured machine gun to repel several enemy counterattacks. Thus, he gloriously completed the arduous task of breaking through and consolidating the breakthrough point, taking only five minutes. Afterwards, he led the troops to continue to advance into the enemy's rear, but due to prolonged illness and physical weakness, he suddenly fainted and fell to the ground. After two hours of emergency treatment, he finally woke up; after waking up, he did not rest but continued to direct the battle until the very end. Therefore, for this capture of Cangxian City, he carried out the combat mission while ill and played a decisive role, and was rated as a Special Class Merit.

	At the celebration meeting, it was announced that Comrade Li Guoying would be promoted to company commander of the Eighth Company of the regiment, and they immediately set off to attack Gucheng. The city was garrisoned by the Kuomintang's direct line troops, the American-equipped 362nd Regiment of the 121st Division of the 94th Army. Li Guoying led the Eighth Company to take charge of attacking the Damao Temple bunker across the ditch from the northeast. In advance, he had also familiarized himself with the terrain many times. When our artillery and machine guns roared, he led the Second Platoon to charge, cleared the caltrops, climbed over the big ditch, and he was the first to charge and seize the guns again. After the enemy in the temple bunker was eliminated, the enemy's entire position began to waver and they began to retreat from courtyard to courtyard. He led a squad to follow closely, chasing all the way to the vicinity of the enemy regimental headquarters in the west of the village. At this time, his leg had already been injured, but he resolutely refused to leave the front line. When the enemy broke through to the west, he led his troops to block the street entrance, eliminating more than 200 enemies. In this battle, the Eighth Company captured the most weapons in the entire regiment, including four heavy machine guns, two rocket launchers, more than forty submachine guns, four mortars, and more than one hundred rifles. For this, Comrade Li Guoying was awarded a Major Merit.

	Although Comrade Li Guoying is so ruthless to the enemy, he is particularly sincere, amiable, and modest to his comrades. He not only plans carefully in battle and cares for the soldiers, but also often goes to the company, platoon, and squad to visit the sick, and helps the cooks in the kitchen to improve the food. He has a very high reputation among the masses. He has never violated mass discipline.

	Comrade Li Guoying is such an outstanding combat hero. Last September, he represented the North China People's Liberation Army and attended the first Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and was elected as one of the members of the Presidium of the conference. This March, when the Chinese Youth Delegation went abroad, he was again assigned as the youth representative of the troops to participate in the celebration of the fifth anniversary of liberation in Budapest, the capital of Hungary, and the "May Day" commemoration and the celebration of the fifth anniversary of liberation in Czechoslovakia. He returned to China in July, and in mid-August he accompanied the Chinese delegation to Korea again. Despite this, he showed no signs of complacency, especially after returning from attending the National Political Consultative Conference, he was even more humble and admirable. He often said to his comrades: "I used to be a long-term laborer. Without the education and training of the Party, without the correct leadership of the superiors and the help of comrades, what could I have done! Revolution is the business of millions of people!"

　　人民功臣李国英
    ——全国战斗英雄会议代表介绍之一
    特等功臣李国英同志，共产党员，现任华北军区某军某师某团三营营长，三十一岁，出生在河北省安国县南堡村一个贫农的家里。二十岁时，因受不住地主的压迫与日本鬼子的欺侮，毅然离开家乡，参加了冀中第十七团。日寇投降后，先后编入地方旅及野战军，接连升任排长、连长、营长等职。十余年来，历经大小战斗七十余次，负伤八次，曾亲手缴获武器计有炮一门、重机枪四挺、轻机枪四挺、步枪四十余支，俘敌百余名。一九四六年，在全旅英模大会上获得光荣的头等战斗英雄称号，而后又连立特功，和两个大功，成为出色的战斗英雄。
    他的特点：是勇敢、精心计划、善于掌握战机。
    他获得全旅头等战斗英雄称号，是在一九四六年后半年，那时他当排长。在此半年中，他参加了该团各个战斗，每次都是表现无比英勇，缴获多，胜利大，其中最特殊的是保北战役的孙村和漕河战斗。
    孙村是保定东面敌人第一个强固的据点，十一月三日天明以后，三连爆破了炮楼西侧的房所，他趁着烟土弥漫，带着全排迅速越过深沟冲进去，可是转过几道房院，迎面又是一个深宽丈五的大沟，隔沟蹲着一座五丈高的大炮楼，炮楼上的机枪像爆豆似地向他们扫射。他机警地伏在沟沿，在主力部队用火力封锁敌枪眼时，便连续投过两个手榴弹，烟土掀起后，一跃而起，大喊：“二排随我来！”就奔向吊桥口；敌人见他来势凶猛，便慌乱地向西南逃窜，企图突围，但被我其它部队截住，只得又返回钻进炮楼。他这时趁着敌人措手不及就很快端着枪，上好刺刀，跟进炮楼，喊着：“快点交枪，保证你们生命安全”。于是敌人吓得把机枪、步枪都扔在地上。
    第一次漕河战斗，他们负责攻击西面碉堡，起初他带六班冲锋受挫回来，就要求组织再次突击，但未经上级允许。天已经黑了，他匍匐到岗楼四周，反复侦察了地形，选择突击道路，一夜未眠。天将明，他再三要求，声明保证完成任务。上级许可后，他就迅速将全排选编了一个班，带领着他们秘密地绕到敌人侧面，而后他又亲自带着三个人通过围沟，把地雷靠在楼跟下，敌人丝毫不知，爆炸一响，就很快的解决了战斗。
    一九四七年二月，二打漕河，他已升为该团三连副连长，他首先召集了战士们说明攻坚的任务，叫一排在前头冲锋，他跟着上去。到了炮楼前边大沟地方，因敌人火力太猛，他便又调上两挺机枪，封锁敌枪眼。他们在稠密的火力下，抢上了沟头的碉堡，他向枪眼扔了个手榴弹，结果敌人一个整连被消灭了。李国英同志缴获迫击炮一门，战斗结束后记了一大功。
    随着胜利形势的发展，一九四七年初部队编为野战军。五月末，部队向沧县出发，准备展开青沧战役，这时他正害病，上级提出叫他住院休养，被他坚决拒绝了，他说：“我坐车去也得参加战斗。”到目的地他的病刚好，听说本团任务是攻打沧县城，他便不顾病体，主动找连长研究，以书面向营团首长提出要求主攻；并宣誓保证完成一切任务。
    上级批准后，他便整天在主攻的三排，具体帮助编战斗组，研究动作。二营把外围敌人扫清了，他率领战士们到了沧县西关附近，自己带着一个通讯员去看地形，选好了突破口，又爬在城前老百姓房子的门缝中，察看炮楼的所在地，测量城墙的高度和护城河的宽度及深度，看一次怕不准确，一连看了三次，又回来叫排长都爬过去看。反复观察达十三次之多。整夜不睡觉，具体指导打通墙壁、检查器材，把云梯抬到城下附近。
    黄昏时候，随着猛烈的炮声，在狂风暴雨、雷电交加中，总攻开始了！第一个冲出去的就是他，部队随即跟着上去，这时敌人用火力极力封锁，但在他英勇机智的指挥下，有两个战士首先登上城墙，他在第三名的位置上也上了城。上城后他即缴获了一挺轻机枪。他用缴获的机枪，打退敌人数次的反扑。至此光荣的完成了突破与巩固突破口的艰巨任务，前后只用五分钟时间。而后，他又带领部队继续向纵深发展，猛插到敌人侧后，但因久病体弱，忽然昏迷倒地，经两个钟头急救，才苏醒过来；醒来后，他并不休息，继续指挥战斗，直到最后结束。因此次攻克沧县城，他带病执行战斗任务，并起了决定作用，被评为特功。
    庆功会上，宣布提升李国英同志为该团八连连长，随即出发攻打固城。该城驻有蒋匪嫡系部队美械化装备的九十四军一二一师三六二团。李国英带领八连由东北面负责攻击隔沟的大庙碉，事先他也是多次熟悉了地形。当我炮火机枪吼叫起来的时候，他就带领二排冲上，扫清鹿砦，爬过大沟，第一个冲锋缴枪的又是他。庙碉敌人被解决后，敌人便整个动摇，开始逐院撤退，他又带领着一个班紧紧跟进，一直追到村西头敌人团部附近。这时他腿部已经负了伤，但坚决不下火线。当敌人向西突围时，他又带领部队堵住街口，解决敌人二百余名。这次战斗，第八连在全团缴获最多，计有重机枪四挺，火箭筒二个，冲锋枪四十余支，迫击炮四门，步枪百余支。此次李国英同志荣记大功。
    李国英同志对敌人虽然这样狠，但对同志特别诚恳、和蔼、虚心，对战士不但在战斗中精心计划，关心爱护，平时也经常到连排班去看病号，到伙房帮助炊事员改善伙食。在群众中有极高的威信。他从来没有违犯过群众纪律。
    李国英同志，就是这样出色的战斗英雄。去年九月他曾代表华北人民解放军，出席中国人民首届政治协商会议，并当选为大会主席团之一。今年三月，中国青年代表团出国，又被派为部队青年代表，参加了匈牙利首都布达佩斯的庆祝解放五周年纪念大会，和捷克纪念“五一”和庆祝解放五周年纪念大会。七月间返国，八月中旬又随中国代表团赴朝鲜。虽然如此，他却毫无居功骄傲的表现，特别是出席全国政协会议回来后，更加谦逊可敬，他常常对同志们说：“我过去是一个扛长活的，如果没有党的教育培养，没有上级的正确领导和同志们的帮助，我能作些什么呢！革命就是千千万万人的事情啊！”
