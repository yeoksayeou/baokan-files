　　Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 11th: The Korean working class is making every effort to launch a wartime material production increase movement to support the front lines. In the northern half of the Republic, 53 enterprises and more than 370 advanced work teams have participated in this movement. In close contact with technicians, workers have created many improved production methods. Due to the adoption of workers' rationalization proposals, nine enterprises in the metal sector will increase the country's income by more than 300 million yuan by the end of this year. Steelworker An Xiangzao created a new method of matching raw materials in the process of manufacturing special steel, as well as 13 other rationalization proposals, which will increase the country's income by more than 70 million yuan by the end of this year. Worker Jin Yongzhou from a certain factory invented a new method of manufacturing detonating fuses, increasing production by eight times and reducing costs to one-third of the original. Han Hengwen, a worker from a certain machinery manufacturing plant, manages two machines alone and completes four times his production quota every day. Li Zhonghuan, a miner from a certain mine, has increased productivity to six times that of pre-war levels.

　　Workers in the newly liberated areas of the southern half of the Republic are also launching a production increase struggle to strive for the reunification and independence of the motherland. Workers in the Second Production Department of the factory led by Manager Park Rong have increased production by nine times since liberation. All the workers of the machinery repair shop led by Manager Zhang Xizhe work day and night, regardless of enemy bombings, completing their quotas at a productivity rate of more than five times their assigned levels each day. All production agencies in the southern half are also doing their best to supply more materials to the front lines.

　　朝鲜工人支援前线热烈展开增产运动
    改进生产方法超额完成计划
    【新华社平壤十一日电】朝鲜工人阶级正全力展开战时物资的增产运动，以支援前线。共和国北半部参加这一运动的，已有五十三个企业所、三百七十余先进的工作班。工人在与技师的紧密联系下，已创造了很多改进生产的方法。金属部门的九个企业所，由于采用了工人的合理化建议，到今年年底将给国家增加三亿元以上的收益。制钢工人安相造创造了在制造特种钢的过程中配合原料的新方法，及其他十三种合理化建议，到今年年底将给国家增加七千余万元的收益。某厂工人金永周发明了制造引火线的新方法，把生产量提高到八倍，把成本降低到原来的三分之一。某机械制作所的工人韩亨文一个人管理两台机器，每天完成着生产定额的四倍。某矿山的矿工李钟焕把生产率提高到了战前的六倍。
    共和国南半部新解放地区的工人为了争取祖国的统一和独立，同样展开了增产斗争。朴熔经理所领导的工厂第二生产部工人，解放后已将生产量提高到九倍。张熙哲经理所领导的机械修理所全体工人，不顾敌机的轰炸，夜以继日地工作，每天以五倍以上的生产率完成着自己的定额。南半部各生产机关正同样以全力为前线供给更多的物资。
