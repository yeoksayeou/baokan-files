Xinhua News Agency, Paris, September 28th: According to a TASS report from Paris: A mass rally was held on September 24th at Place de la Buffalo in Paris to protest the extension of military service terms and the Pleven government's war policy. The rally was jointly called upon by the French General Confederation of Labor, the Communist Party, the Single Socialist Party, the French Republican Youth League, and the National Veterans Association.

　　Annav, Secretary-General of the Paris Regional Trade Union Federation, pointed out in his opening remarks: In order to carry out war preparations, the French government is restricting workers' wages and, with the assistance of American trade union splitters, is attempting to persecute the French General Confederation of Labor. However, 1950 is not 1939. In various enterprises, the struggle against the war preparation policy, against 18 months of military service, and against the retention of personnel who have completed their service is growing stronger. The participation of 2.5 million people in the Paris region in signing for peace is proof of this.

　　Blancourt, Secretary-General of the Single Socialist Party, pointed out that the real threat to French security is American imperialism, and the French people will never forgive the heinous plans of the American imperialists to prepare for a new war.

　　Durand, Secretary of the French Republican Youth League, said amidst applause from the audience: French youth answer the conspiracy to push them into an anti-Soviet war with a categorical "no". He said: The struggle against extending military service is a struggle for peace and French independence.

　　Maurice Thorez, Secretary-General of the French Communist Party, delivered a long speech to a warm welcome from the masses. Other speakers included Benoît Frachon, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, and Duchemin, Secretary-General of the National Veterans Association.

　　The大会 unanimously adopted a resolution protesting the government's war preparation policy and the decision to extend the term of military service, and called on the working people to strengthen unity and expand the struggle for peace.

　　法国人民反对政府备战政策
    巴黎群众举行集会  抗议延长兵役期限
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社巴黎讯：二十四日巴黎布法罗广场举行群众大会，抗议延长兵役期限和普利文政府的战争政策。大会是在法国总工会、共产党、单一社会党、法兰西共和青年联盟和全国退伍军人协会的联合号召下举行的。
    巴黎区工会联合会总书记安纳夫在开会词中指出：法政府为了进行备战，正在限制工人工资并在美国工会分裂分子援助下企图迫害法国总工会。但是，一九五○年已经不是一九三九年，在各企业机构中，反对备战政策，反对十八个月兵役和反对留用服役期满人员的斗争，正在日益增强。巴黎区有二百五十万人参加和平签名便是证明。
    单一社会党总书记布朗科尔指出真正威胁着法国安全的乃是美帝国主义，法国人民决不饶恕美帝国主义者准备新战争的罪恶计划。
    法兰西共和青年联盟书记杜科朗在全场掌声中说：法国青年用斩钉断铁的“不”字来回答企图把他们推入反苏战争的阴谋。他说：反对延长兵役的斗争就是争取和平与法国独立的斗争。
    法国共产党总书记多列士在群众的热烈欢迎会上发表了长篇演说。其他发言的还有法国总工会总书记勒里普，全国退伍军人协会总书记杜协敏等人。
    大会一致通过决议，抗议政府备战政策和延长兵役期限的决定，并号召劳动人民巩固团结，扩大和平斗争。
