　　WFTU General Secretary Saillant Calls on National Trade Unions to Further Expand Mass Movement in Support of Korean People
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) General Secretary Saillant has written to national trade unions, requesting them to further develop mass movements in support of the Korean people. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions received this letter today, along with a copy of the WFTU's telegram to the Chairman of the Security Council, Malik, demanding that the Security Council stop American imperialism's intervention and aggression in Korea.
    The full text of Saillant's letter to national trade unions is as follows:
    Dear Comrades:
    The World Federation of Trade Unions cannot remain indifferent to the continued and outrageous bombing of Korean cities and villages by American planes, the "scorched earth policy" pursued by the American army, and the repeated threats to use the atomic bomb in Korea.
    The WFTU has sent the attached telegram to Mr. Malik, Chairman of the Security Council, and Mr. Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations; and hopes that all trade union organizations (whether or not affiliated with the WFTU) will support the WFTU's demands and protest against the aforementioned actions of American interventionists in Korea.
    The WFTU has publicly stated its position on the Korean situation. It once again insists that the Korean people have the unconditional right to solve their own problems. The WFTU demands an immediate end to American interference under the guise of the United Nations Charter. The interventionist troops must withdraw from Korea immediately.
    The Secretariat of the WFTU requests national trade unions to take all necessary steps without delay to carry out and further develop mass movements in support of the Korean people.
    With fraternal greetings,
                General Secretary Saillant
                August 16, 1950

　　世界工联总书记赛扬号召各国总工会
    进一步展开支援朝鲜人民的群众运动
    【新华社二十日讯】世界工联总书记赛扬写信给各国总工会，要求各国总工会进一步开展支持朝鲜人民的群众运动，中华全国总工会已于今日收到这一信件并收到附来的世界工联致安理会主席马立克电报一件，该电报要求安理会制止美帝国主义对朝鲜的干涉和侵略。
    赛扬致各国总工会信全文如下：亲爱的同志们：
    世界工联对美机继续不断地横暴地轰炸朝鲜城市乡村，对美军所进行的“焦土政策”，对一再威胁在朝鲜使用原子弹，不能保持不关心。
    世界工联已将附上的电报打给安理会主席马立克先生和联合国秘书长赖伊先生；并且希望所有工会组织（不论是否加入世界工联）支持工联的要求，抗议美国干涉者在朝鲜的上述行动。
    世界工联已曾公开表示对朝鲜事件的态度。它再一次坚持朝鲜人民具有无条件自己解决自己事件的权利。世界工联要求立刻停止在联合国宪章掩盖下的美国的干涉。干涉军队必须立刻退出朝鲜。
    世界工联书记处要求各国总工会要毫不延缓地采取一切必须步骤，进行并更进一步开展支持朝鲜人民的群众运动。
    致兄弟的敬意
                总书记  赛扬
                一九五○年八月十六日
