　　Tong County Special District Carries Out Summer Grain Collection
    Implement Rectification Spirit to Transform Cadre Work Style

[Our Newspaper News] This year's summer grain collection work in Tong County Special District, Hebei Province, has different characteristics from previous years in terms of requirements: First, implement the spirit of rectification and resolutely oppose commandism and bureaucracy in the actual work of summer grain collection; second, accurately grasp the consistency of tasks and policies, and resolutely complete the tasks under the principle of not violating policies. Therefore, under the guidance of the spirit of the Provincial Party Congress, the work style in various places has indeed improved greatly. For example, the main responsible cadres in each county can go deep into various places to understand the situation and effectively analyze the number of mu and yield of wheat fields during the summer grain collection. Some county committee members (such as the Wanping County Committee) even personally helped the masses harvest wheat during the wheat harvest process in order to understand the actual harvest amount of the masses. This has overcome the past phenomenon of simply pushing the collection task to the finance department. In addition, counties, districts, and villages held large-scale cadre meetings and representative meetings to explain policies, discuss methods, and conduct evaluations, so as to democratically formulate the county, district, and village collection and distribution drafts. The broad masses felt that it was fair and reasonable, and the work style of district and village cadres has greatly changed, and the phenomenon of beating and detaining people has basically been eliminated. Furthermore, the spirit of seeking truth from facts has been effectively implemented. For example, Huairou originally reported a yield of 90 jin per mu, which was assessed by the special district as 85 jin. After returning and investigating, it was believed to be 77 jin. The special commissioner approved the collection based on the yield of 77 jin after consideration. In addition, in the process of receiving grain, many areas have effectively taken care of the difficulties of the masses, receiving them whenever they come, and setting up food and lodging stations, hot water stations, and cool sheds. The masses are very satisfied and reflected: "The People's Government takes care of the common people so thoughtfully!"

Many cadres made excuses for coercive orders, which have been promptly criticized and corrected

At the beginning of the summer grain collection, many cadres had ideological obstacles, believing that: "If we implement the policies, we will not be able to complete the tasks," "We cannot complete the tasks without coercive orders," "The higher authorities can talk about democracy, but the lower levels cannot." Taking Fangshan as an example, when deploying the summer grain collection, the cadres had the following statements: One was: "It would be good to complete the task without coercive orders, but what if some people don't pay?" In fact, they didn't think about better working methods, and planned to obtain a legitimate trump card for coercive orders, or shirk the responsibility for not completing the task. This point has later been criticized and corrected by the leadership. Another was: "Village cadres should be forgiven for coercive orders. The superiors give them tasks, the masses ask them for democracy, and their families ask them to work more." This obviously failed to recognize the consistency of the three. The leading cadres immediately explained that the superiors' tasks can only be completed by democratic working methods, and cadres can unite their families and the masses by producing well. It was wrong in the past not to take care of the cadres' production time, and it must be taken care of in the future. Another was: "Of course, it is right not to coerce the masses, but what about those who stubbornly resist and refuse to pay?" Meaning: "These should be arrested and detained without any problem." The leading cadres pointed out again that for individual stubborn households, the government should of course deal with them according to law, but the masses should also be mobilized to discuss and evaluate before dealing with them.

Cadres have departmentalism, resulting in inconsistent policies and tasks.

In addition, departmentalism greatly hinders the realization of the consistency of policies and tasks. Some cadres believe that reducing the burden on the masses means not violating the policies, and fail to realize that not taking what the masses should take, or taking too little, affects the completion of the tasks, which is also not in line with the policies. Some even believe that directly giving things to the masses is called serving the people, and the collection work carried out for the interests of the masses is not serving the people. Departmentalism was also manifested in reporting the number of mu of wheat fields. When reporting achievements in wheat planting, some always over-reported the number of mu, but under-reported the number of mu during collection. Others arbitrarily reduced the yield of wheat fields when they found that the number of mu of wheat fields was over-reported. For example, Tong County's Fourth District found that the number of mu of wheat fields had increased by 10,000 mu, and immediately reduced the yield from 70 jin to 65 jin. These all hinder the accurate completion of the tasks.

Oppose commandism, and prevent the tendency of tailism.

In opposing commandism, cadres have more or less developed a tailism mood. Many district cadres reflected: "Don't look for materials to rectify the Party!" "It doesn't matter if the task is not completed, being rectified for commandism is going to be rough!" Even if they clearly discover that there is departmentalism at the lower level, they do not persuade them. Especially the most inexcusable is that the leading cadres of Huairou County originally reported a yield of 90 jin, and the special commissioner assessed it as 85 jin in order to take care of the balance. After the county cadres returned to the county, they investigated and believed it to be 77 jin, and submitted it to the special commissioner for approval. However, the district-level cadres arranged according to 63 jin. The county leaders did not reflect or correct it in time at that time until the special commissioner criticized it before they corrected it, but it was too late. These all lack a correct mass perspective and violate the principle of leading the masses forward.

### 通县专区进行夏征中  贯彻整风精神转变干部作风

　　通县专区进行夏征中
    贯彻整风精神转变干部作风
    【本报讯】河北省通县专区各县今年夏征工作在要求上具有与往年不同的特点：第一是贯彻整风精神，从夏征的实际工作中，坚决反对了命令主义、官僚主义；第二是确切掌握任务与政策的一致性，使其在不违反政策的原则下，坚决完成任务。因此，在省党代会的精神指导下，各地工作作风确实有了很大的改进，如各县主要负责干部在夏征中都能深入各地了解情况，切实分析麦田亩数、产量，甚至有些县委委员（如宛平县委）亲自在收麦过程中帮助群众收割，以便了解群众真实的收获量。这，就克服了过去把征收任务单纯推给财政部门的现象。又，各县、区、村都召开了范围较大的干部会及代表会，讲政策、谈办法、进行评议，以民主方式制定了县、区、村的征收分配草案，广大群众都感到公平合理，区村干部的作风有了很大的转变，打人、扣人的现象基本上消灭了。再就是切实贯彻了实事求是的精神。如怀柔原自报产量每亩产量九十斤，专区评为八十五斤，回去以后经过调查认为是七十七斤，专署经过考虑即批准按七十七斤产量计征。另外，在接收粮食中，许多地区切实照顾了群众的困难，何时送来，何时接收，并设有食宿站、热水站、搭凉棚，群众感到非常满意，并反映：“人民政府照顾老百姓真周到啊！”
    不少干部为强迫命令找借口，已及时批判纠正
    夏征开始时，不少干部都是有思想障碍的，认为：“要执行政策就完不成任务”，“不强迫命令完不成任务”，“上级讲民主可以，下级不能讲民主”。以房山为例，在布置夏征时，干部有以下几种说法：一种是：“不强迫命令又能完成任务是好，但有的不缴怎么办呢？”实际是不去想更好的工作方法，打算讨一个合法的强迫命令的王牌，或是推脱完不成任务的责任。这一点后来已经领导方面批判纠正。再一种是：“村干部强迫命令应该原谅，上级给他们要任务，群众给他们要民主，家中要他们多干活。”这显然是没有认识到三者的一致性。领导干部即说明了上级任务要用民主的工作方法才能完成，干部好好生产，才能团结家庭，团结群众，过去对干部生产时间不加照顾是不对的，今后一定照顾。还有一种是：“对群众当然不强迫是对的，对于个别硬抗不交的怎么办呢？”意思是说：“这应当毫无问题的抓起来、扣起来了。”领导干部又对此指出：对于个别的硬抗户当然应由政府依法处理，但也应当发动群众来讨论评议然后处理。
    干部存在本位思想，致政策任务不能一致。
    另外，本位主义思想，大大障碍着政策与任务一致性的实现，有些干部认为群众负担少了，就是不违反政策，未认识到群众应拿的不拿、或拿的过少而影响任务的完成，同样也是不合乎政策。甚至有人认为直接给群众东西才叫做为人民服务，为着群众利益而进行的征收工作不是为人民服务。在报麦田亩数上，也表现了本位主义思想，在种麦报告成绩时，有的总多报亩数，征收时又少报亩数。还有的发现麦田亩数多报了，就任意降低麦田产量。如通县四区发现麦田亩数增多了一万亩，即把产量由七十斤降到六十五斤，这些，都障碍着任务的确切完成。
    反对命令主义，要防止尾巴主义倾向。
    在反对命令主义中，干部或多或少滋长着一种尾巴主义情绪，不少区干部反映：“别给整党找材料！”“任务完不成不要紧，犯了命令主义得挨整！”明明发现下边有本位思想，也不进行说服。尤其最不应该的是，怀柔县领导干部，在这次征收中，原报产量九十斤，专署为了照顾平衡，评为八十五斤。该县干部回县后经过调查，认为是七十七斤，呈准专署执行。但区级干部却按六十三斤布置。县的领导方面当时既不反映也不及时纠正，直到专署批评后，才去纠正，但已晚了。这些都是缺乏正确的群众观点，而违反了领导群众前进的原则。
