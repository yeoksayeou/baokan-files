Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, 19th: The Third Congress of the International Organization of Journalists, which opened here on the 15th, concluded victoriously on the 17th after three days of meetings.

The congress unanimously approved the work reports of the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists and the Secretary-General of the International Organization of Journalists, Hronek, and elected the leading bodies of the International Organization of Journalists. It elected French representative Hermann as Chairman of the IOJ (Note: Hermann is an international political commentator for the French newspaper *Liberation*, and editor of the monthly *International Handbook*), and elected Simonov (USSR), Hu Qiaomu (China), Kowalczyk (Poland), Lidberg (Finnish female journalist), and Doudou Gueye (African Black journalist, recently arrested by the French colonial authorities for progressive activities) as Vice-Chairmen; Hronek was re-elected as Secretary-General.

The congress resolved to mobilize progressive journalists worldwide to fight for peace and democracy, and to expose warmongers, actively promote the peace signature campaign, and participate in the preparatory work for the Second World Peace Congress. The resolution emphasized that all progressive journalists should use all methods, through newspapers, radio, film, and literary works, to oppose war propaganda, and denounce all those who promote war as warmongers or war criminals. The congress instructed the Executive Committee and Secretariat of the International Organization of Journalists to prepare the necessary documents and announce a list of warmongers through newspapers and radio.

The congress resolved that the slogan "Prohibit Interference in Korea and Vietnam" must become the battle cry of all honest journalists. The congress resolutely protested the American invasion of Korea, and sent a telegram to United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie in the name of the congress, protesting the barbaric bombing of the Korean people by American planes, and urging the Security Council to resolve the Korean issue quickly in a legal and peaceful manner.

The congress adopted the new constitution of the International Organization of Journalists, stipulating that the basic aim of the IOJ is to strive for peace and a better future for humanity. According to the new constitution, individual journalists and groups in various countries may join the International Organization of Journalists on their own, even if the national journalists' organizations in those countries have not joined the International Organization of Journalists.

The congress resolutely protested the violation of freedom of speech and publication in capitalist countries, protested the persecution of progressive journalists in these countries, and called on all honest journalists in capitalist countries to join the ranks of progressive journalists worldwide. The congress decided to expel the Yugoslav Journalists Association from the International Organization of Journalists, because all the work of the Yugoslav Journalists Association has confirmed that it is the mouthpiece of the imperialist warmongers and the Tito fascist clique.

On the morning of the 17th, the congress heard a report by French representative Hermann on the material and legal status of journalists, and held discussions.

In his closing remarks, Secretary-General Hronek of the International Organization of Journalists declared that the resolutions of the congress would powerfully help intensify the struggle for peace, and suggested that the Fourth Congress of the International Organization of Journalists be held in Paris in 1952.

    【新华社赫尔新基十九日电】十五日在此间开幕的国际新闻记者协会第三届代表大会，举行了三天的会议之后，已于十七日胜利闭幕。
    大会一致批准国际新闻记者协会执行委员会和国际新闻记者协会秘书长赫朗尼克的工作报告，并选出了国际新闻记者协会的领导机构，选举法国代表赫尔曼为国际记协主席（按：赫尔曼为法国解放报国际政治评论员，《国际手册》月刊编辑），选举西蒙诺夫（苏）、胡乔木（中）、科瓦尔杰克（波兰）、李德柏格（芬兰女记者）和杜杜——盖（非洲黑人记者，最近因进步活动被法国殖民当局逮捕）等为副主席；选举赫朗尼克连任秘书长。
    大会决议动员全世界进步新闻记者为争取和平、民主和揭露战争贩子而斗争，积极推广和平签名运动，参加第二届世界拥护和平大会的筹备工作。决议强调指出：一切进步新闻记者应以一切方法，通过报纸、广播、电影和文艺作品反对鼓吹战争的宣传，并斥责一切鼓吹战争的人为战争贩子或战争罪犯。大会责成国际记者协会执行委员会及秘书处准备必要的文件，经由报纸和广播宣布战贩名单。
    大会决议：“禁止干涉朝鲜与越南”的口号，必须成为一切正直的新闻记者的战斗口号。大会坚决抗议美国侵略朝鲜，并以大会名义致电联合国秘书长赖伊，抗议美国飞机野蛮轰炸朝鲜人民，敦促安理会以合法与和平的方式迅速解决朝鲜问题。
    大会通过了国际新闻记者协会的新会章，规定记协的基本宗旨为争取和平与人类美好的未来。根据新会章，各国的个别记者和团体，虽在各该国家的全国性记者组织未加入国际新闻记者协会的情况下，亦可自行加入国际新闻记者协会。
    大会坚决抗议资本主义国家对言论出版自由的侵犯，抗议对这些国家内进步记者的迫害，并号召资本主义国家一切正直的记者参加全世界进步记者的行列。大会决定把南斯拉夫记者协会开除出国际记者协会，因为南斯拉夫记者协会的全部工作已证实它是帝国主义战争贩子和铁托法西斯集团的喉舌。
    大会于十七日上午，曾听取了法国代表赫尔曼关于新闻记者的物质及法律地位的报告，并进行了讨论。
    国际新闻记者协会秘书长赫朗尼克在致闭幕辞时宣称：代表大会的决议将有力地帮助加紧争取和平的斗争，并建议于一九五二年在巴黎召开国际记者协会第四届代表大会。
