Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, September 10th: The first Jiangxi Provincial People's Representative Conference, with land reform as its central theme, was held from August 27th to September 6th. In an atmosphere of democracy and unity, the participating representatives, after enthusiastic discussion and research, formulated the detailed implementation rules for the Jiangxi Provincial Land Reform Law. The conference reviewed and summarized the provincial People's Government's work over the past year and elected the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Provincial Consultative Committee.

The conference, through group and plenary discussions, unanimously approved the report on the work of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government over the past year and two months by Chairman Shao Shiping, the report on military work by Commander Chen Qihan of the Jiangxi Military Region, and the report on financial and economic work by Vice-Chairman of the Provincial People's Government and Director of the Finance Committee, Fan Shiren.

After listening to the report by Chen Zhengren, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, on the implementation of land reform in Jiangxi Province, and after extensive and meticulous research and discussion, the conference concluded that the current situation in the province is as follows: Over the past year, the people of the province have experienced mass movements such as supporting the front, suppressing bandits, opposing local tyrants, reducing rent, implementing reasonable burdens, and production for disaster relief. Implementing land reform has become an urgent demand of the broad masses of peasants. In particular, the masses in the old land revolution areas have a higher level of class consciousness and experience in the struggle for land reform, and their demand for land reform is even more urgent. At present, the mobilization of the peasant masses has been carried out relatively deeply in about 30% of the province, and preliminary mobilization has taken place in another 50% of the province. Since the promulgation of the Land Reform Law of the People's Republic of China, ideological and policy propaganda and mobilization for land reform have been widely carried out among cadres in various places, and key investigations and studies have been conducted on rural class relations and land relations. Land reform key experimental work is currently underway in various regions. In addition, in conjunction with mass movements such as rent reduction and opposition to local tyrants, various places have consolidated the organizations of village peasant associations and held land reform training courses at the provincial, special district, and county levels, training 23,400 cadres, and are continuing to train 17,200 cadres. Based on the above situation and the historical characteristics of Jiangxi, the conference unanimously agreed with the suggestion of Chen Zhengren, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: This year's land reform should focus on the former land revolution areas, that is, land reform should be implemented in about 6,970,000 agricultural population areas in 36 counties throughout the province; the remaining areas must wait until after the autumn harvest next year to be completed.

Finally, after full democratic discussion and deliberation, the conference made detailed rules for the implementation of land policy in Jiangxi Province, as well as resolutions on the work reports of the Provincial People's Government over the past year and two months, etc. The conference also elected Chen Zhengren as Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Consultative Committee, Chen Qihan, Fang Zhichun, Liu Yifeng, and Ouyang Wu as Vice-Chairmen, and ninety-two members.
