Newspaper Review
	Things That Should Be Publicized

	The "Sichuan West Daily" published news of the Sichuan West Administrative Office handling letters from people of all sectors in June on July 22nd in an important position. On August 17th, it continued to publish news of handling letters from July. These two news items were transcribed from two government announcements, detailing that the Sichuan West Administrative Office received a total of 862 letters from people of all sectors in June, containing criticisms, suggestions, inquiries, requests, accusations, and complaints of different natures, and 994 letters in July. Among the thousands of different letter writers, there were people of various classes and occupations, including a small number of landlords. The contents of the letters touched upon almost every aspect of the Administrative Office's work. The Administrative Office replied to each of these letters and took appropriate action. The announcements also explained why some cases could not be handled and their nature.

	In the June announcement, the Sichuan West Administrative Office made the following statement:

	"A small number of staff members in the government have not been serious and timely enough in handling letters, and some letters have not been replied to yet. This is mainly because they have not realized the importance of this work. Handling letters from all sectors earnestly and promptly, accepting public criticisms and suggestions, and welcoming public supervision of our staff are important ways for the People's Government to connect with the masses. Obviously, we must attach importance to this matter and improve this work."

	The July announcement concluded with these words:

	"We are pioneering and improving the work of handling letters from all sectors. We still know very little about the opinions and feedback from all sectors. To do this work well, we hope that everyone will continue to write to us."

	What a humble attitude filled with self-criticism!

	The Southwest is a new area, liberated less than a year ago. People from all sectors in Sichuan West submitted 862 appeals to the People's Government in June alone, and another 132 in July. This shows that the broad masses of people's trust in the People's Government is constantly growing, and also shows that there are still many shortcomings in our government work that need to be improved through the criticisms and suggestions of people from all sectors. To accomplish our country's people's democratic cause, we must widely listen to and absorb the opinions of the people and encourage them to actively participate in national political life. The appropriate handling of letters from all sectors by government agencies at all levels is the best way to connect with the masses and encourage their political enthusiasm.

	We are still in the initial stage of establishing a people's country. It is conceivable that government agencies in every region can receive letters from all sectors almost every day. If we make a statistic across the country, the number of these letters must be very large. However, we rarely see reports on how various regions handle these letters. We believe that the Sichuan West Administrative Office's attitude towards letters from all sectors should be well publicized among the masses.

	Unfortunately, the "Sichuan West Daily," which published these news items, did not publish any related commentary to make readers pay more attention to the government's serious and earnest attitude of valuing public opinion.

	Talking about News Maps

	When we open a newspaper and see news about war or transportation, we always hope to see maps illustrating these news items at the same time. In this case, the attached map or inserted diagram is not just a map, but mainly news. A major military or transportation news item often cannot fully express its power in words. If the relevant map is published at the same time, it can make the news exert greater publicity power.

	Newspapers in various places have begun to pay attention to maps. Unfortunately, a careless style has eroded the seriousness of our news work. After the start of the Korean War, newspapers in various places published maps of the Korean War. However, these maps often brought some errors that confused readers. For example, the sovereignty issue of "Tsushima Island" is an example.

	If you want to understand the sovereignty issue of "Tsushima Island" from the map in the newspaper, it is a rather difficult task, because the newspaper has at least three different treatments of the sovereignty of "Tsushima Island":

	One, listed within the borders of Korea (this newspaper [July 20th attached map], Liberation Daily, Xi'an Mass Daily, Chongqing Xinhua Daily, Yangtze River Daily, Tianjin Daily, Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, Shanghai Wen Hui Bao, Shandong Mass Daily, Nanjing Xinhua Daily, Zhejiang Daily, Southern Daily, etc.);

	Two, no line is drawn between the Korean mainland and Tsushima Island to mark it (Guangming Daily, etc.);

	Three, listed outside the borders of Korea (this newspaper, August 13th attached map).

	Here, only the third treatment is correct, but its shortcoming is that it does not explain that Tsushima Island belongs to Japan.

	Eliminate Intolerable Typos!

	The news in the newspaper must be typeset before it can reach the reader. In the typesetting process, proofreading is an important job. Proofreading must not be ignored. We should treat it as a political task. An error in a word or a punctuation mark can lead to serious political consequences. In the past, China called this proofreading work "校雠" (xiào chóu), which means to correct typos as if they were enemies. We should treat our proofreading work with such a serious attitude.

	However, in our proofreading work, there is a large amount of carelessness, resulting in a constant stream of typos in the newspaper, sometimes so wrong that it is unreadable, and even forming political problems. This careless style is an irresponsible attitude towards the country and the people and should be strictly rectified.

	Here are a few more significant examples:

	① "胁从不问" (xie cong bu wen - those who were coerced will not be held accountable), wrongly written as "胁从必问" (xie cong bi wen - those who were coerced must be held accountable). (Yangtze River Daily, July 23rd short commentary)

	② "声援日本人民反美" (sheng yuan ri ben ren min fan mei - support the Japanese people in opposing the US), wrongly written as "声援日本人民反苏" (sheng yuan ri ben ren min fan su - support the Japanese people in opposing the Soviet Union). (Yangtze River Daily, July 9th Mass Garden, "Oppose the US Imperialist Plot to Support Japan")

	③ "中苏友协" (zhong su you xie - Sino-Soviet Friendship Association) wrongly written as "中美友协" (zhong mei you xie - Sino-American Friendship Association) (Xinwen Daily, June 18th, local edition, Gorky Memorial News)

	④ "我们的土地改革也来采取绝对的平均主义" (wo men de tu di gai ge ye lai cai qu jue dui de ping jun zhu yi - our land reform will also adopt absolute egalitarianism), "也未" (ye wei - not yet) wrongly written as "也来" (ye lai - also come). (Chongqing Ta Kung Pao, August 6th, third page headline, answering readers' letters)

	The above are just a few of the more important examples that have been discovered. There are many more similar examples. We hope that newspaper workers will treat their work seriously and resolutely eliminate these intolerable typos!

### 报纸巡礼

专栏：报纸巡礼

　　报纸巡礼
    应当宣传的事情
    川西日报七月二十二日以重要地位刊出川西行政公署处理各界人民六月份来信的消息，八月十七日又继续刊出处理七月份来信的消息。这两次消息是由两个政府公告转录而成的，内容是说明川西行政公署六月份收到各界人士关于批评、建议、询问、要求、检举控告等不同性质的来信共八百六十二件，七月份收到九百九十四件。在一千多位不同的来信者中，包括了各种不同阶级和不同职业的人民，当然也包括少数地主阶级分子。来信的内容，几乎涉及到了行署工作的每一方面。行署对这些来信一一作了答复并进行了适当的处理。并在公报中说明，其中未能处理的是因为什么缘故，性质如何。
    在六月份公报中，川西行署作了这样的说明：
    “政府中少数工作人员，在处理来信中还不够认真和及时，甚至有少数来信至今尚未作复。这主要是由于他们还没有认识到这项工作的重要。认真而及时的处理各界来函，接受群众的批评建议，欢迎群众监督我们的工作人员。解释和答复群众的疑问，这乃是人民政府联系群众的重要方法之一。很明显，我们必须重视这件事，必须改进这项工作。”
    七月份公报则是以这样的话结束的：
    “对于处理各界人士来信这一工作，我们正在开创，正在改进，各界人士的意见和反映，我们还知道得很少。为作好这一工作，望大家继续多来信联系。”
    这是何等谦虚的和充溢着自我批评精神的态度！
    西南是新区，解放还不到一年，川西各界人士在六月份一个月内就向人民政府提出了八百六十二件诉愿，七月份又多提出了一百三十二件。这说明广大人民对人民政府的信赖正在不断的增长，也说明在我们的政府工作中还存在着不少的缺点，需要借各界人士的批评和建议来进行改善。为了完成我们国家的人民民主事业，我们必须广泛地听取、吸收人民大众的意见，并且鼓舞他们积极参加国家政治生活。各级政府机关对各界人士来信的适当处理，便是联系群众、鼓舞群众政治积极性的最好的办法。
    我们还处在建立人民国家的初期阶段，可以想像，每个地区的政府机关，几乎每日都可以收到各界人士的来信，假如在全国范围内来个统计，这种来信的数字一定很大。但是，我们很少见到关于各地区如何处理这种来信的报道。川西行署对待各界来信的态度，我们认为是应当很好地在群众中进行宣传的。
    可惜的是，发表这些消息的川西日报没有发表与此有关的言论，使读者更深切地来注意政府重视人民意见的严肃认真的作风。
    谈谈新闻地图
    打开一张报纸，看到有关战争或交通的消息，我们总希望能同时看到说明这些新闻的地图。在这种情况下，附张的地图或插排的简图，其作用不只是因为它是地图，而主要是因为它是新闻。一个重大的军事或交通新闻，字面上往往不能完全表达出它所具有的力量，假如同时刊出有关的地图，就可以使新闻发挥更大的宣传力量。
    各地报纸都已经开始注意地图。可惜的是，粗枝大叶的作风侵蚀了我们新闻工作的严肃性。朝鲜战争开始后，各地报纸都发表过关于朝鲜战争的地图。但是这些地图，往往带来一些使读者感觉糊涂的错误。比如“对马岛”的主权问题就是一个例子。
    假如你要从报纸上的地图弄明白“对马岛”的主权问题，那是一件相当困难的事，因为报纸上对“对马岛”的主权至少有着三种不同的处理：
    一、列入朝鲜国境内的（本报【七月二十日附图】、解放日报、西安群众日报、重庆新华日报、长江日报、天津日报、上海大公报、上海文汇报、山东大众日报、南京新华日报、浙江日报、南方日报等）；
    二、朝鲜本土与对马岛之间，不划线加以标志的（光明日报等）；
    三、列在朝鲜国境外的（本报八月十三日附图）。
    在这里，只有第三种处理是正确的，但是它的缺点是没有说明对马岛属于日本。
    消灭不可容忍的错字！
    报纸上的新闻先通过排印，才能到达读者眼前的。在排印过程中，校对是个重要的工作。校对的工作是绝对不能忽视的，我们应把它当作一种政治任务来对待，一个字、一个标点的错误都会引致严重的政治影响。中国过去把这种校对工作叫作“校雠”，意思就是说，要把错字当作仇人一样来校正。我们正应当以这样严正的态度来对待我们的校对工作。
    但是，在我们的校对工作中，却大量存在着粗枝大叶的作风，以致报纸上错字层出，有时错到不能卒读，甚至形成政治问题。这种粗枝大叶的作风，是对国家、对人民不负责任的态度，是应予严格整顿的。
    试举几个比较重大的例子：
    ①“胁从不问”，错成“胁从必问”。（长江日报七月二十三日短评）
    ②“声援日本人民反美”，错成“声援日本人民反苏”。（长江日报七月九日大众园地《反对美帝扶日阴谋》文）
    ③“中苏友协”错成“中美友协”（新闻日报六月十八日本市版纪念高尔基新闻）
    ④“我们的土地改革也来采取绝对的平均主义”，“也未”错成“也来”。（重庆大公报八月六日三版头条答读者信）
    以上仅举出了已经发现的几个较重要的例子，同样的例子还多得很。我们希望报纸工作者严肃地对待自己的工作，坚决消灭这些不可容忍的错字！
