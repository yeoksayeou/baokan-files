　　Guangxi Provincial People's Bank Increases Loan Amount
    Supporting Sales of Local Products in the Province
    Half of Loans in Second Half of Year Will Be Directed to Export Businesses
    [This newspaper's Guilin dispatch] The People's Bank of Guangxi Province is vigorously providing loans to support the export of local and special products within the province. The loan plan and distribution ratio for the second half of the year have been initially determined. Guangxi Province is a typical province where agricultural economy accounts for the largest proportion. Local industries are extremely backward. The entire province only has fourteen match factories, three bone meal factories, two sulfuric acid factories, and a few small-scale mechanical iron factories and workshops for weaving, leather making, sugar making, and oil pressing. Therefore, all industrial products for daily use, such as cloth and general merchandise, need to be transported from other provinces. However, the province is rich in rural local and special products, which have been exported in large quantities over the years, such as tung oil, tea oil, soybeans, ramie, gallnuts, peanut oil, cinnamon bark, cassia oil, star anise, and fennel oil, which are transported to Guangzhou and Hong Kong for sale. In the one or two years before liberation, due to the frantic exploitation by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the production volume was greatly reduced. For example, tung oil, which had a peak annual output of over 30 million catties, suffered because the reactionaries set extremely low "official prices," forced purchases, and monopolized foreign sales, making tung tree planters unprofitable. Tung farmers in Wuming and other areas mostly cut down tung trees for firewood or charcoal, leading to a sharp decline in production. In the early days of liberation, industrialists and businessmen adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the rampant harassment of bandits and secret agents caused frequent traffic disruptions, making it difficult to restore foreign sales for a time. For example, soybeans in Longzhou and cinnamon bark in the Dayao Mountains of Wuzhou were piled up in production areas and could not be transported out, causing a major blow to the local people's economy.
    To this end, since its establishment, the People's Bank of Guangxi Province has been restoring market finance and helping industrial and commercial businesses with their turnover by providing appropriate loans. The main goal is to organize exports. The loan figures for the first half of the year were highest in March, with a total of 18.3 billion yuan issued throughout the province, 85 percent of which was allocated to state-owned trading enterprises and 15 percent to help private enterprises. From April onwards, in coordination with currency withdrawal, the number of loans decreased. From April to June, a total of 5.6 billion yuan was loaned, 60 percent of which was allocated to import and export trade, 20 percent to public and private enterprises, and 20 percent to general industrial and commercial businesses. The loan plan for July was 5 billion yuan, 70 percent of which was used to support import and export sales.
    Thanks to the bank's active assistance and the gradual restoration of social order in various places, the quantity of export goods gradually increased. Among them, the tung oil concentrated in Nanning for transfer to Guangzhou increased by four and a half times in May compared to March.
    In order to further strive for large-scale exports of local products and improve the lives of farmers, the Guangxi Provincial Native Products Company has formulated a plan to purchase and sell star anise, fennel oil, ramie, gallnuts, cinnamon bark, and beans to Guangzhou this autumn. However, due to the shortage of cadres in state-owned trading companies, they cannot directly purchase and transport goods in rural areas. In order to encourage merchants to go to the countryside to purchase goods, the bank will increase the amount of loans from August to help sales merchants solve the problem of lack of working capital. The maximum planned loan amount is 45 billion yuan. According to the season of production, sales, and processing of local products in the province, loans in August are planned at 11.7 billion yuan, loans in September at 19.5 billion yuan, loans in October will increase to 30.5 billion yuan, loans in November will increase to 40.5 billion yuan, and loans in December will increase to 45 billion yuan. The entire loan allocation is as follows: industry accounts for 15 percent, handicraft industry accounts for 5 percent, transportation accounts for 10 percent, export business accounts for 50 percent, inter-city sales business within the province accounts for 15 percent, and 5 percent is allocated to cooperative and institutional groups. It is also stipulated that public and private sectors should be allocated in a ratio of four to six to thoroughly implement the spirit of adjusting public-private relations.

　　广西省人民银行增加贷款金额
    扶植省内土产运销
    下半年贷款将有半数投向出口事业
    【本报桂林讯】人民银行广西省分行，大力贷款，扶植省内土产特产出口，下半年贷款计划与分配比例已经初步确定。广西省是一个典型的农业经济占最大比重的省份，各地工业均极落后，全省只有十四家火柴厂，三家骨粉厂，二家硫酸厂，少数小规模的机械铁工厂和织布、制革、制糖、榨油等作坊。因此，一切民生日用工业品如纱布、百货均需仰赖省外运济。但省内农村土产特产颇为丰富，历年均多输出，如桐油、茶油、大豆、苎麻、五倍子、花生油、桂皮、桂油、八角、茴油等都运往广州、香港销售。解放前一、二年内，由于国民党反动派的疯狂剥削，大大的减缩了生产量，如其中桐油一项，最盛时年产三千万斤以上，因为反动派统治时订出极低的“官价”强迫收购，垄断外销，致使植桐者无利可图，武鸣一带的桐农，多将桐树砍伐供作薪柴或烧炭之用，产量因而锐减。解放初期，工商业经营者心存观望，加上土匪特务的流窜骚扰，交通时受阻碍，外销一时难以恢复。如龙州的大豆，梧州大徭山区的桂皮，堆积产地，无法运出，使当地人民经济大受打击。
    为此，人民银行广西省分行自成立后，即通过适当的放款，来恢复市场金融，帮助工商业的周转，主要的是组织出口，上半年放款数字以三月份最多，全省共计放出一百八十三亿元，其中百分之八十五投放给公营贸易企业，百分之十五帮助私营企业；四月份起因配合货币回笼，贷放数字减少，自四月至六月共计贷放五十六亿元，其中百分之六十投放于出进口贸易，百分之二十投入公私企业，百分之二十贷给一般工商业。七月份贷款计划是五十亿，其中百分之七十是用于扶助出进口运销事业上。
    因为银行的主动帮助，加上各地社会秩序逐渐恢复，出口物资数量渐次增多，其中桐油一项集中南宁转输广州的，五月份曾比三月份增达四倍半。
    为着进一步争取土产大量出口，改善农民生活起见，广西省土产公司拟定计划，在本年秋季将收购八角、茴油、苎麻、五倍子、桂皮、豆类等运销广州。但由于国营贸易公司干部太少，不能直接到乡间采运。银行为鼓励商人下乡采购，从八月份起增加贷款数额，帮助运销商解决缺乏资金周转的问题，贷款计划最高额是四百五十亿元。按照全省内土产产销、加工的季节，八月份贷款计一百一十七亿元，九月份贷款计一百九十五亿元，十月份将增为三百零五亿元，十一月份增为四百零五亿元，到十二月份则增至四百五十亿元。全部贷款分配如下：工业占百分之十五，手工业占百分之五，交通事业占百分之十，出口事业占百分之五十，省内埠际运销事业占百分之十五，百分之五分配给合作、机关团体。并规定公营与私营按四与六的比例，以彻底贯彻调整公私关系的精神。
