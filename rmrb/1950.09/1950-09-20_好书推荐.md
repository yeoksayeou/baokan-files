    《New Geography of the Soviet Union》
    Written by Su. N. Mikhailov, translated by Chen Yuan, published by Haiyan Bookstore
    This book is one of the popular science readers in the Soviet Union for cultivating patriotism. From a horizontal narrative, it provides a clear and vivid description of the natural environment and economic and political construction of the sixteen republics and all countries of the Soviet Union. The author guides the reader on a "map tour": starting from Moscow, first touring its surroundings, then going straight down the Volga River to the Caucasus, crossing the southwestern grasslands to the northwestern sea, then from the northern woodlands to the Urals and Central Asia, and then across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. The writing is lively and the system is concise and clear. This book not only helps readers understand the geographical environment of the Soviet Union, but more importantly, it lets readers know how people conquer nature and transform the natural environment in a socialist society, so that nature can serve human society and humans can obtain a more comfortable and beautiful life.
    This book is different from old-fashioned geography textbooks, which are full of place-name accumulations. Every important place name, every river, and every mountain peak mentioned in this book can leave a deep impression on the reader's mind. In this book, every river or every mine is linked to living social reality and becomes an organic component of socialist construction. We feel that in this book, river names or place names are not isolated names, but entities with flesh and blood and related to real life.
    I solemnly introduce to readers: this book is worth reading. When you read it, it's like reading a light and beautiful novel, but in fact, you are reading a geography book of scientific facts.
    From the standpoint of patriotism, this book is worthy of our attention and imitation.
    The teaching of geography and nature is of great help to the cultivation of people's patriotism. Kalinin pointed out the necessity and importance of Soviet students understanding their motherland and its nature. In his article "War and Education," he wrote: "Our land forests, our rivers and seas, enterprise centers, collective farms, our schools—all of these can serve as rich materials for education. Children are sensitive and must be told in detail the story of various migratory birds that fly back to their motherland every year, and the fish that live in various rivers and lakes—this is a good lesson in understanding nature, and it also enhances a child's love for the motherland." He also said: "We often talk about the education of patriotism, but this education should begin with a deep understanding of one's own motherland. Therefore, we must study the geography of the motherland."
    We already know that geography is a powerful tool for cultivating patriotism. To maximize the effectiveness of this tool, excellent popular geography readers are worthy of attention. This book is an excellent model. Its descriptive style, writing skills, and geographical facts are all worthy of our attention and imitation as reading materials for patriotic education.
    How the Soviet people conquer nature and change the natural environment is vividly depicted in every chapter, every section, and every place in this book. Due to the transformation of the natural environment, a new life naturally emerges.
    Take the Komsomolsk-on-Amur in the Far East as an example:
    "Thirteen years ago, the trees in the taiga were pulled out, establishing the foundation of a huge machine manufacturing center—Komsomolsk-on-Amur. This city was named to reward the Communist Youth League, who took on the arduous task of building a new industrial city in the wilderness at that time.
    "Above the ancient fishing village, there are now rows of large brick houses. Between them stand huge steel structures of factories. Beyond this, the newly built wooden houses stretch to the distant mountains. The ground has been excavated, the rails have been laid, and construction is constantly underway everywhere. Only from an airplane can you see the outline of this young city.
    "Komsomolsk-on-Amur has a great view. Everything shows strength, beauty, and large-scale construction.
    "Young Soviet men and women consider it an honor to be here. This city was built on the distant Amur River on the suggestion of Stalin, which is the embodiment of industrial heroism—during several five-year plans, this heroism transformed the face of the Soviet Union, especially the face of the Soviet Far East..."
    It can be said that in any place in this book, readers can find that the description of geography is intertwined with the great atmosphere of patriotism and socialist construction. (Excerpt from the sixth issue of Scientific Popularization Communication)

    《History of the Soviet Union》
    Edited by Pankratova, published by Tianxia Book Company
    "We need such a Soviet history textbook, in which the history of the Great Russian people is not separated from the history of other nationalities in the Soviet Union, this is the first. There, the history of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union is not separated from the entire history of Europe, and generally not separated from world history, this is the second." (Stalin)
    In 1934, the resolution of the Soviet People's Commissariat and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) believed that the history textbooks and teaching in Soviet schools were not satisfactory. The main shortcoming was that "textbooks and teaching themselves are of an abstract and formulaic nature, providing students with abstract definitions of socio-economic forms, instead of narrating the most important events and facts in a lively and interesting way and in chronological order, as well as the characteristics of historical figures, etc., to teach national history; in this way, abstract sociological rules replace the systematic narration of national history."
    《History of the Soviet Union》, edited by the History Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and edited by Professor Pankratova, is a textbook compiled according to the opinions of Stalin et al. and the above-mentioned resolution. It has been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education of the Soviet Russia as a national textbook for high school students. In the bibliography of 《Outline of Soviet History Research》 (edited by Dachuk), it is the only work selected as a textbook. The original book is divided into three volumes, "narrating from ancient history to the end of World War II." 《History of the Soviet Union》 published by Tianxia Book Company is a translation of various chapters of the third volume of the original book—from "The First Bourgeois Democratic Revolution" to "The Soviet Union—a Socialist Country" (this article narrates the end of the Soviet people's great patriotic war and the formulation of the new five-year plan).
    This volume of 《History of the Soviet Union》 is a history of the founding of the Soviet Union. It narrates historical events in chronological order, and provides detailed descriptions of important historical phenomena, historical figures, and dates; and the writing is lively and does not make people feel boring at all. At the same time, this history is not only the history of the Russian people, but also the history of the joint overthrow of the Tsarist system by all nationalities of the Soviet Union and the joint construction of a great socialist country. That is to say, the history of the Russian people is not separated from the history of other nationalities. As for the connection between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union and European and world history, the authors have not neglected it. More importantly, this book does not make lengthy empty talk about the important construction of the Soviet economy and culture, but concisely and accurately states the experience of socialist construction.
                  (Huang Biyun)
    Editor's note: The first volume of the original book has now been translated by Zhonghua Book Company, and is called: 《Ancient and Medieval History of the Soviet Union》; according to the advertisement of Zhonghua Book Company, the second volume of the original book, 《Modern History of the Soviet Union》, is being translated.

    《苏联新地理》
    苏·Ｎ·米海洛夫著  陈原译  海燕书店版
    这本书是苏联培养爱国主义的通俗科学读本之一。从横的叙述中，把十六个加盟共和国和全苏联各国的自然环境与经济政治建设，作了明确而生动的叙述描写。作者引导着读者作“地图上的旅行”：从莫斯科出发，首先巡视它的周围，其次，沿伏尔加河直下高加索，越过西南部草原到西北部的海，再从北部林地到乌拉尔、中央亚细亚，然后横跨西伯利亚到太平洋。文字生动，系统简明。这本书不仅帮助读者了解苏联的地理环境，而且更主要地让读者知道：在社会主义的社会里面，人们如何征服自然，变革自然环境，使大自然为人类社会服务，使人类得到更舒服而美好的生活。
    这本书不同于旧式的地理教科书，尽是些地名的堆砌，它所提出的每一个重要地名，每一条河流，每一个山峰，都能在读者心中留下深刻的印象。在这本书当中，每一条河流或每一个矿山，都和活生生的社会现实联结起来，都变成社会主义建设的一个有机的构成部分。我们感觉：在这本书里，河名或地名不是孤立的名称，而是有血有肉与现实生活有关联的实体。
    我郑重向读者介绍：这本书是值得读的，在你读的时候，像读一部轻松美丽的小说，但是其实在读一部科学事实的地理书。
    从爱国主义的立场看，这本书是值得我们重视和模仿的。
    地理和自然的讲授对人民爱国主义的培养有着很大的帮助。加里宁指出苏联学生们认识祖国及其大自然的必要和重要性。他在论《战争与教育》的文中写道：“我们的土地森林，我们的河流和大海，各企业中心，集体农庄，我们的学校——所有这一切都能作为教育的丰富材料。儿童是敏感的，必须对他细述每年飞回祖国的各种季候鸟的故事，在各江湖里所生存的鱼类——这是认识自然的好功课，同时也提高了一个儿童对祖国的热爱。”他又说过：“我们常常谈到爱国主义的教育，但这种教育应从深刻的认识自己祖国来开始。因此，我们必须研究祖国的地理。”
    我们已知道地理是培养爱国主义的有力工具，要发挥这工具的最大效能，优良的通俗地理读本是值得注意的。这书是一本顶好的范本，它的描述体裁、文字技巧和地理事实，处处值得我们作爱国主义教育读物来重视和模仿的。
    苏联人如何征服自然、改变自然环境，本书的每一章、每一节、每一个地方，都给以生动的描绘。由于自然环境的改造，新的生活就很自然地涌现出来了。
    拿远东的青共城做个例子罢：
    “十三年前泰加的树木被拔去，建立了一个巨大的机器制造中心——青共城的基础。这个城是为了奖励共产主义青年团而命名的，那时他们负担起在莽林中建设一个新的工业城的艰辛任务。
    “在古老的渔村上面，现在已有成座成座的大砖屋。其间屹立着巨大的钢铁构造的厂房。过此，则新建的木房子一直伸展到辽远的群山去。地面给开掘了，铁轨给敷设了，到处都在不断的建设着。只有从飞机上才可以看见这个年青的城市的轮廓。
    “青共城有着伟大的景色。每一桩事情都表现了力量、美和大规模的建设。
    “年青的苏维埃男女认为在此地是一种光荣。这个城是根据斯大林的建议给建立在辽远的阿穆尔河上的，这是工业的英雄主义的化身——在几次五年计划时期，是这英雄主义变革了苏联的面貌，尤其是苏维埃远东区的面貌……”
    可以说，本书中任何一个地方读者都可以发现地理的描叙是交织了爱国主义与社会主义建设的伟大气息的。（节录科学普及通讯第六期）

    《苏联历史》
    潘克拉托娃主编  天下图书公司版
    “我们需要这样的苏联历史教科书，在这本书里，大俄罗斯人历史不与苏联其他民族的历史相分离，这是第一。在那里苏联各民族历史也不与整个欧洲历史相分离，并且一般的也不与世界历史相分离，这是第二。”（斯大林）
    一九三四年苏联人民委员会议和联共（布）中央的决议，认为苏联各学校中的历史读本和教授本身，都不能令人满意。主要的缺点是“教科书及教授本身，都带着抽象的和公式的性质，提供给学生们一些社会经济形态的抽象定义，而不用生动有趣的方式和依照年代的次序，讲述最重要的事件和事实，以及历史人物的特点等以教授本国史；这样就以抽象的社会学的规式，代替了本国历史之有系统的讲述。”
    苏联科学院历史研究所编辑，由潘克拉托娃教授主编的《苏联历史》，就是根据斯大林等的意见和上述决议编写的教科书，经苏俄教育部审定，为高中程度的国定教科书。在《苏联历史研究提纲》（达楚克主编）的参考书目中，是教科书中唯一被选入的著作。原书共分三卷，“从古代史一直叙述到第二次世界大战结束”。天下图书公司所出的这册《苏联历史》，是原书第三卷各篇的译文——从《第一次资产阶级民主革命》到《苏联——社会主义国家》（在这一篇中叙述到苏联人民伟大的爱国战争胜利结束、新五年计划制定为止）。
    这一册《苏联历史》就是一部苏联建国史，它是按照历史年代的次序讲述历史事件，对于重要的历史现象、历史人物和年月日等，都有详尽的叙述；并且文字生动，一点也不令人感觉枯燥乏味。同时这部历史，不仅仅是俄罗斯人民的历史，而且是苏联各民族共同打倒沙皇制度，共同建设伟大的社会主义国家的历史。也就是说，俄罗斯人的历史没有与其他民族的历史相分离。至于苏联各民族与欧洲及世界历史的关联，也没有为著者所疏忽。更重要的是这本书对于苏联经济文化等重要的建设，不作冗长的空谈，而是简明确切地陈述了社会主义建设的经验。

    编者按：该书原书第一卷，现已由中华书局译出，称为：《苏联上古中古史》；据中华书局广告，原书第二卷《苏联近世史》已在移译中。
