[This City News] Private Hua Dong and Zhong Sheng Cloth Factories in Beijing, under the principle of mutual benefit for labor and management to develop production, launched a production competition in August. Hua Dong Cloth Factory, through labor-management consultation meetings, stipulated a progressive wage system. The management guaranteed the timely supply of materials, and the labor guaranteed compliance with labor discipline. The factory exceeded its target in August. The factory management requested the production of 550 bolts of "August 1st" white cloth in August (the average production volume in May, June, and July was 439 bolts). After discussion, the workers set a plan to produce 590 bolts. Each worker set a personal plan, actively engaged in production, paid attention to the maintenance of machinery, and studied technology. With the joint efforts of all workers, a total of 635 bolts of cloth were woven in August, exceeding the factory's requirements and the workers' own plans. The defective cloth rate also dropped from 15% in the past to 7%. The factory earned a net profit of over 4,000 jin of millet in the entire month, excluding all expenses. Workers' wages also increased by 66.6% according to the progressive system. Labor and management were both very satisfied, and the production competition continued in September. The private Zhong Sheng Weaving Factory launched a production competition from August 26th. In the first week of the competition, the output exceeded the quota by two bolts, and the first-class cloth rate increased from 90% to 99%, creating the factory's highest record. The factory launched the production competition by first passing a production contract through labor-management consultation meetings, stipulating the monthly production figures, the guarantee conditions for both labor and management, and the reward methods. After the competition began, the factory's Party, labor union, and Youth League corrected the shortcomings of poor coordination in past work and unanimously focused on production. The factory carried out propaganda and mobilization through blackboard newspapers, slogans, red flags, and production charts, encouraging the workers' production enthusiasm.
