　　Lidice - Pyeongtaek
　　Editor's Note: Lidice is a small village in Czechoslovakia. In June 1942, this small village was completely burned down by the Hitler bandit squads, all the men were killed, and the women and children were driven to Germany to do hard labor. The shocking crime of the Hitler thugs cremating Lidice caused unanimous anger among the anti-fascist people of the world at the time.
　　A few weeks ago, the prosperous Korean small city of Pyeongtaek was still living a peaceful life of labor. Cooking smoke curled in the city air; children played in the gardens. Now, it has been razed to the ground, becoming a pile of rubble. Thick dust covers it like a shroud. The cause of this disaster was neither an earthquake nor a landslide! The crazy American interventionists dropped hundreds of bombs on the peaceful city of Pyeongtaek. With devilish accuracy, they divided the entire city into several squares and then bombed it for eight hours, even though there was not a single military target in Pyeongtaek. After repeated bombings, the word "Pyeongtaek" was recorded in the annals in gunpowder and blood, alongside Guernica in Spain and Lidice in Czechoslovakia! The ferocious ability of the American interventionists not only keeps pace with the Hitler executioners, but even surpasses them. We have no doubt that in the future trial of the new "Nazi war criminals" across the ocean, a pinch of ashes from the city of Pyeongtaek will also be one of the physical evidences!
　　How should we explain the continuous and crazy bombing of the peaceful, freedom-loving, and heroic Korean people by the American aggressors? These thugs believe that war is the most suitable career for them. Lenin once pointed out that "internationally intertwined capital is doing brilliant business by relying on weapons and soldiers." They are looking for a "way out" for their impending crisis in the midst of war. The sound of machine guns firing and the sound of abacuses calculating the bloody business of war in Wall Street offices are merging together. For all mankind, war is a terrible thing. For a small group of big capitalists, war - as Lenin emphasized - is a means of making a lot of money!
　　Just by briefly browsing through the reactionary American newspapers, one can immediately see how happy these cannibals are with the rumbling of cannons and the explosions of bombs in Korea; how delighted they are with the smell of gunpowder and blood coming from Korea.
　　The *Commercial News* happily pointed out that the Korean incident made it possible to avoid the serious industrial and commercial depression that was inevitable this summer. *Business Week* breathed a sigh of relief, saying that the Korean War made the billionaires "no longer uneasy about the deepening economic crisis" because "military spending has increased." *Barron's*, the mouthpiece of the American stock exchange, shouted wildly that due to the impact of the Korean incident, the leadership of American foreign policy could be "transferred from the clumsy hands of Congress to the stern hands of the Pentagon (Department of Defense Building)," and the Pentagon is the nest of war-mongers.
　　The same idea is described in more detail and more specifically in the *Lichtstrahlen* magazine published in "Bonn Germany". This magazine provides an eloquent picture: according to the opinions of industrial capitalists, the bloody plan to instigate a new war is collapsing, which means that the peaceful end of the Korean incident is a threat in the eyes of the American interventionists and their obedient slaves.
　　"At the moment when peace is suddenly determined," *Lichtstrahlen* magazine wrote, "12,000 American factories will go bankrupt. According to the investigation of the Ordnance Bureau, these factories are all dedicated to war work. If peace can continue for a while, then this fate will also affect 30,000 enterprises... Everything will stagnate, because coal, minerals and oil are mainly supplied for war purposes. Many scientific activities will be paralyzed. Entire groups of politicians, military and non-military experts will have no work to do. Peace... in their view, is a greater disaster than a new world war."
　　Therefore, war - is a means to ensure the full operation of all death industries, a source of continuous enrichment for atomic bomb and cannon kings; war makes it possible to completely subordinate all American domestic and foreign policies to the bloody money regime, even though the bloodshed of all mankind is required to achieve this goal! This is why the aggressors across the ocean are hindering peace in Korea, they see Korea as a "bridgehead" from which to push the whole world into the abyss of a new world disaster!
　　There is another important reason that can explain the violence of the interventionists' lawlessness in Korea: they see that the army of this heroic people is fighting not only for the freedom and unity of the motherland, but also for the victory of world peace! Every shot of this army - is a shot to defend peace! On every inch of the motherland it liberates, what is flying is not the pirate flag of aggression, but the glorious flag of peace! When the Korean people's fighters go to the battlefield to fight against the Truman-MacArthur mercenaries, in every battle slogan they shout, the invincible and indelible word "peace" rings like a bugle! This is why the interventionists regard the small city of Pyeongtaek, which cannot be seen on the map, not only as a stronghold - a stronghold worth spending tons of metal and explosives to destroy, but also as a bunker that should be leveled, because it is inhabited by people who are fighting for peace.
　　However, the Korean incident provoked by the aggressors across the ocean has brought them failure on the battlefield. The deafening sound of American cannibals destroying the city of Pyeongtaek has gained a huge response in every corner of the earth. This response, like the legendary bell, mourns the dead, calls on the world, and arouses a storm of anger!
　　People of all nations in the world are cursing the American war-mongers, and all honest people on earth are demanding to stop American aggression, stop the barbaric bombing of peaceful residents, and withdraw the interventionist troops in Korea. Those who are eager to maintain and consolidate world peace have successively submitted many new proposals to the President of the Security Council Malik and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. The World Federation of Trade Unions demanded to immediately prevent Korean residents from being bombed again and all kinds of threats about the use of atomic bombs. The Czechoslovak government protested that the Security Council, under the control of the "Americanized majority", has not been able to blame the American aggressors and stop the suffering of the Korean people until now. The All-Soviet Central Council of Trade Unions insisted in its telegram in the name of the Soviet laborers that the Security Council must condemn American aggression against Korea, stop the brutal bombing of Korean cities and villages by the American air force, and pass a resolution requiring the United States to immediately stop attacking Korea and withdraw all foreign troops in Korea.
　　Let the shameless tricks that Wall Street is carrying out in the United Nations organization against the will of all nations end quickly! No intervention in Korea! - This is the unanimous call of billions of people, and now the struggle for peace is rising more and more widely with this slogan.
　　Billions of people are now joining the ranks of peace supporters, because the actions of the imperialist robbers in Korea have made a strong impression on them.
　　Not long ago, it can be seen from the announcement released by the Standing Committee that nearly one-fourth of all mankind, 600 million people, have signed the peace declaration. At the same time, after the announcement, recent new materials prove that the numbers listed in the announcement are constantly growing.
　　The war in Korea and the entire aggressive policy of American imperialism, like, has made the ordinary people of the world face up to the actual situation. It is no coincidence that the number of peace signatures in Italy has increased from more than 1.4 million to more than 10 million after the American invasion of Korea.
　　The more rampant the American imperialists are in Korea, the more frantically and openly they prepare for a new war, and the more shamelessly they want to subordinate the people of the countries colonized by them to themselves - the more consolidated the peace camp becomes, and the more powerful and stronger this invincible new movement becomes.
　　Just as the small Czech village of Lidice has become a symbol of the cruelty of German fascism in the memory of the people, this destroyed small Korean city of Pyeongtaek will become a symbol of the brutality of American executioners in our consciousness.
　　The fate of the executioners of Lidice is well known. The peace-loving people of the world will use this to remind the American aggressors.

### 利台斯——平泽

专栏：

　　利台斯——平泽
    编者按：利台斯是捷克的一个小村庄。在一九四二年六月，这个小村庄曾被希特勒匪帮的别动队全部焚毁，所有的男子被杀死，女人和孩子们则被赶到德国去做苦工。希特勒匪徒火葬利台斯的惊人罪行，当时曾引起全世界反法西斯人民的一致愤怒。
    几星期前，繁荣的朝鲜小城市平泽，还过着和平的劳动生活。炊烟在市空袅绕着；孩子们在花园中游玩着。现在，它已被夷为平地，变成一堆瓦砾。浓厚的灰尘像尸衣似的掩盖着它。造成了这种灾难的原因，不是地震也不是山崩！疯狂的美国干涉者向和平的平泽城投下了数百颗炸弹。他们以魔鬼般的准确把全城划分为若干方块，然后轰炸八小时之久，虽然在平泽连一个军事目标也没有。在多次反复的轰炸以后，编年史上就以火药和鲜血记入了这个字眼：“平泽”，同西班牙的奎尔尼加和捷克的利台斯并列在一起！美国干涉者，穷凶极恶的本领，不仅与希特勒刽子手们并驾齐驱，而且简直凌驾于他们。我们毫不怀疑，在将来审讯海洋彼岸的新“纳粹战犯”的审判台前，平泽城的一撮灰烬也将要是物证之一！
    美国侵略者连续疯狂地轰炸着和平的、爱自由的英勇的朝鲜人民，这一种盲目的凶恶性，应当怎样加以解释呢？这些暴徒认为战争是对自己最合适的事业。列宁曾经指出说：“国际上交织着的资本，就靠武器和战士，做着显赫的事业。”他们在战争中间为等待着自己的危机寻找“出路”。机关枪的发射声与华尔街办公室中计算战争的血腥事业的算盘声是汇合着的。对于全体人类来说，战争是一件可怕的事情。对于一小撮大资本家来说，战争——列宁强调指出过，——是大可赚钱的手段！
    只要约略翻阅一下美国的反动报纸，立即可以看出，隆隆的炮声和轰炸朝鲜的炸弹爆裂声使这些食人的人们何等快乐；从朝鲜发出的火药和血腥的气味使他们多么高兴。
    《商业新闻》报愉快地指出：朝鲜事件使今夏本来无可避免的工商业的严重萧条，有了避免的可能性。《企业周刊》轻舒了一口气说：朝鲜战事使得亿万富翁们“不会再因经济危机的加深而不安了”，因为“军备的支出增加了”。美国交易所的传声筒《拜龙》杂志狂呼着：由于朝鲜事件的影响，美国外交政策的领导可以“从国会的笨拙的手转到五角大楼（国防部大厦）的严峻的人们的手中”了，五角大楼就是战争贩子的巢穴。
    同样的思想在“波恩德国”出版的《利希脱拉撒》杂志中，叙述得更详细更具体。这个杂志提供了一幅雄辩的图画：依据工业大资本家的意见，挑拨新战争的血腥计划的崩溃，从而也就是说：朝鲜事件的和平结束，在美国干涉者及其顺从的奴隶看来，是一种威胁。
    “在忽然确定了和平的那一瞬间”，《利希脱拉撒》杂志写道：“美国工厂就有一万二千家会倒闭，这些工厂，据军火局的调查，都是专为战争工作的。如果和平能继续一些时候，那么这种命运还要波及到三万个企业……一切都要停滞下来，因为煤、矿产和石油主要都是供给战争用的。许多科学活动都将陷于瘫痪。整批的政治家，军事及非军事的专门家们都将没有工作可做。和平……在他们看来，是比新的世界战争更大的惨祸”。
    因此，战争——是保证一切死亡工业完全开工的手段，是原子弹——炮弹大王不断致富的泉源；战争有可能彻底使美国全部内政外交政策隶属于血腥的金钱政权，虽然为了达到这个目的需要全人类流血！这就是为什么海洋彼岸的侵略者这样阻挠朝鲜和平的原因，他们把朝鲜看做一个“桥头堡”，从此把全世界推向新的世界灾难的深渊！
    还有一个重要的理由，是可以解释干涉者在朝鲜胡作非为的狂暴的：他们看到这个英勇的人民的军队是不仅为了祖国的自由和统一，而且还为了世界和平的胜利而战斗的军队！这支军队的每一射击——就是保卫和平的射击！在它所解放的祖国每一寸土地上，飘扬着的不是侵略的海盗旗帜，而是拥护和平的光辉灿烂的旗帜！当朝鲜人民战士走向与杜鲁门——麦克阿瑟雇佣兵搏斗的战场的时候，他们的每一个战斗的口号中，都像号角似的响着不可战胜、不能根绝的一个字眼“和平”！这就是为什么干涉者把在地图上看不到的小城市平泽，不仅看做一个据点——一个值得化费数吨金属和炸药来消灭的据点，还把它看做一个应该铲平的碉堡，因为这里住着为和平而斗争的人们。
    但是，海洋彼岸侵略者所挑起的朝鲜事件，在战场上给他们带来了失败。美国食人者毁灭平泽城的震耳欲聋的炸弹声，在地球各个角落获得了巨大的反响。这个反响像传说中的铃声一样哀悼死者，号召世人并唤起他们愤怒的风暴！
    世界各族人民都在咒骂美国战争贩子，地球上一切诚实的人们都在要求制止美国的侵略，停止对和平居民的野蛮轰炸并撤退在朝鲜的干涉军。那些渴望保持并巩固世界和平的人们，都向安理会主席马立克及联合国秘书长接连提出了许多新的提议。世界工联要求立即防止朝鲜居民再受轰炸和各种关于使用原子弹的威吓。捷克斯洛伐克政府抗议安理会在“美国化多数”控制之下直到如今还不能责备美国侵略者，并使朝鲜人民的痛苦停止。全苏工会中央理事会在其电报中以苏联劳动者的名义坚持安理会必须谴责美国侵略朝鲜，制止美国空军对朝鲜城市及乡村的残暴轰炸，并通过决议要求美国立即停止进攻朝鲜，并撤出在朝鲜的一切外国军队。
    华尔街违反着各族人民的意志，在联合国组织中进行着的那些无耻把戏赶快结束吧！不许干涉朝鲜！——这是亿万的人们的一致呼声，而且现在争取和平的斗争带着这一口号愈来愈广泛地高涨着。
    亿万的人们，现在参加了和平拥护者的行列，这是因为帝国主义强盗在朝鲜的行为使他们有了强烈的印象。
    不久以前，和大常委会所发布的公告中可以看出约近全人类四分之一的六亿人已经在和平宣言上签了名。同时公告宣布后，最近新的材料证明着公告中所举出的数字正在不断增长着。
    朝鲜的战争和美帝国主义的全部侵略政策一样，使全世界普通人民正视了事物的实际情况。意大利一百四十多万的和平签名人数，在美国侵入朝鲜之后即增加为一千多万，并不是偶然的。
    美国帝国主义者在朝鲜愈是猖獗，他们愈是疯狂地公开地准备着新战争，愈是无耻地想使被他殖民地化了的国家的人民从属于自己——和平阵营就愈巩固，这一不可征服的新运动就愈有力，愈强大。
    正像捷克的小村利台斯在人民的记忆中成了德国法西斯残酷的标志一样，被毁灭了的这个朝鲜小城市平泽将会在我们的意识中成为美国刽子手的兽行的标志。
    利台斯刽子手的命运是众所周知的。世界爱好和平的各族人民要用这件事来提醒美国的侵略者们。
