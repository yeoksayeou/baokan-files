　　The Role of the Ordering System in Heavy Industry Economic Planning
    Zhang Dadian

　　(I)
　　Ordering contracts are a form of economic relationship between industrial enterprises and product supply and marketing organizations. Planned and organized product supply and marketing must be realized through a series of ordering contracts. The implementation of the contract system in the Ministry of Heavy Industry began with the ordering of steel and electrical machinery in February of this year, and later machine ordering also adopted the contract form. In the process of implementing the contracts, the important significance of the contract system has been deeply experienced. It has played its due role in organizing supply and marketing, promoting production, and completing industrial plans.
　　The signing of contracts is carried out according to the plan. The National Heavy Industry Conference in November 1949 determined the policy of recovery and construction of heavy industry and formulated the heavy industry economic plan. The supply and marketing agencies then compiled a production and sales balance plan based on the production plans of the industrial plan and the application forms and orders submitted by various consumer departments. The basic supply conditions of this plan, with the consent of the various consumer departments and approval of the government, became the basis for signing product supply and marketing contracts. On this basis, the realization of the heavy industry economic plan has been strongly guaranteed through the organization of contracts.
　　The contract system in the Ministry of Heavy Industry initially adopted three basic forms: overall contracts, partial contracts, and direct contracts. Its content includes the product supply contracts of various central ministries, the mutual supply contracts of public and private enterprises, the product exchange contracts of affiliated enterprises, the procurement contracts for imported equipment, and the processing and ordering contracts of private enterprises. The signing of this series of contracts of different forms and different natures has enabled various enterprises and economic organizations to establish new supply and marketing relationships on the basis of contracts. Contracts have steadily penetrated into actual economic relationships.
　　Economic conditions vary from region to region, so the selling price of products cannot be consistent. In order to regulate the selling price of products in various regions, product supply has adopted the form of overall contracts signed by the supply organization with the consumer departments, and then partial contracts signed separately with each region, to appropriately adjust the price differences of regional products. Procurement contracts were signed first with each region in the form of partial contracts to stabilize their confidence in signing contracts, and direct contracts were signed specifically with the import departments. Exchange contracts are signed directly by the regions, stipulating the mutual benefit conditions for both parties. The processing and ordering contracts signed to take care of the production of private industry are conducted directly by East China with local private enterprises. Through the organization of contracts, the mutual relations between various economic organizations, state-owned enterprises, and private enterprises have become clearer and more specific. Not only can production enterprises carry out production correctly according to production charts, but the sources of raw materials and machinery used by consumer departments for economic construction are guaranteed, which is of great significance for the recovery and development of machine and electrical machinery production. Through the allocation of ordering tasks, the nation's machinery industry and electrical machinery manufacturing industry have embarked on a new path after being in a state of maintenance and semi-suspension. It also appropriately organized the order allocation of private enterprises, giving them certain tasks to process and manufacture, and give play to the production strength of private industry to serve economic construction. In this way, the state-owned economy and the private economy cooperate and develop production together, and the contract plays an active organizing and promoting role, becoming a powerful weapon for fighting to complete the economic plan.
　　In the past, various regions and enterprises rarely had economic ties, lacked mutual understanding, and there was a serious lack of production objects and sales markets. The products of one region were overstocked, while another region could not solve the problem and was eager to import, resulting in supply and marketing imbalances and disconnections between production and sales. After the signing of contracts, years of mutual misunderstanding were communicated, and the production situation and technical conditions of enterprises in various regions were deeply understood. More importantly, various precision products were discovered, such as high-speed steel, nickel-chromium steel, and hard alloys in Northeast China, electrical materials and precision machinery in Shanghai, and measuring instruments and precision gauges in Southwest China. These precision products can all be manufactured by ourselves and no longer depend on imports; many kinds of steel, motors, and machines can all be produced by ourselves and no longer have to pursue foreign goods in the market. As a result of signing contracts, the settlement of products in various regions is mutually offset and balanced as much as possible in mutual allocation, avoiding the circulation of large amounts of currency in the market. The use of foreign exchange has also been unified and concentrated. All major raw materials that cannot be resolved domestically or whose output is insufficient for application, such as silicon steel sheets, electrolytic copper, and raw rubber electrodes, are purchased by the supply agency in a unified manner, and planned and focused, avoiding the decentralization and blind storage of procurement in various regions. Such appropriate organization of supply and marketing is conducive to price stability, while saving foreign exchange, reducing financial expenditures and cash payments, and increasing national income. The contract has become an effective tool to overcome blind production and blind supply and marketing, and a material basis for controlling the market, mastering prices, and avoiding intermediate exploitation.
　　The ordering tasks are further promoting production towards rational division of labor, and planned and step-by-step progress, and the production capacity and technical conditions have also been fully utilized and improved. Most of them can deliver on time and ahead of schedule. Because the supply side reasonably organizes its production capacity, improves production equipment, properly utilizes raw materials and fuels, plans capital turnover, and utilizes ordering income after receiving orders, product costs have been reduced again and again. From the ordering to the present, the cost of steel in North China has been reduced by 19%, pig iron has been reduced by 18.1%, motors have been reduced by 9%, transformers have been reduced by 10%, and cement has been reduced by 17.4%; the cost of steel in East China has been reduced by 17%, and the reduction in cost has increased the purchasing power of various consumer departments. The contract can help enterprises discover their potential production capacity, consolidate the enterprise's economic accounting system, and is a powerful material stimulus for reducing costs and eliminating waste.
　　Therefore, the practical significance of the contract system lies in its ability to appropriately organize product supply and marketing, accelerate commodity circulation, improve production capacity, consolidate economic accounting, eliminate waste, increase capital accumulation, and complete and overcomplete national plans ahead of schedule. The connection and unification of planning, economic accounting, and contracts have become the actual strength to strengthen the foundation of economic planning and complete economic plans.

　　(II)
　　Signing contracts is a new thing for the Ministry of Heavy Industry, and it is still on the road of exploration. Although some achievements have been made in the implementation process, there are still some serious problems.

　　First, due to lack of experience and insufficient preparation, the demanding departments cannot follow the procedures of fulfilling the contract according to the submitted application and the order form, the number of orders is hesitant and undecided, and the specific specifications and real samples cannot be presented, the number of established orders is repeatedly reduced, or even canceled. The contracting departments cannot determine the delivery deadline, cannot propose the product price, and cannot guarantee the specifications and quality. Entangled in these problems, the time for signing the contract was delayed and the integrity of the original plan was broken. The overall concept of individual contracting departments is not enough, there is no clear understanding of production and construction, there is a strong commercial economic consciousness, and they are unwilling to take out the real cost and argue over prices, which greatly hinders the smooth promotion of the contract.

　　Second, at present, industry is mostly in the recovery period, and economic construction has just begun. The understanding of the overall industrial situation is very poor, there is a lack of accurate statistics on production figures, and the characteristics and laws of production cannot be grasped. Often the user departments need more in the first half of the year and less in the second half of the year, while the contracting departments are just the opposite, resulting in unbalanced production and sales. Sometimes, due to the lack of full estimate of the potential production capacity, the products completed beyond the plan cannot be sold in time after the production capacity is improved, forming a backlog of products and delaying the turnover of funds.

　　Third, the ordering was not organized according to the correct composition of the contractual relationship. The overall contracts and partial contracts signed for steel and electrical machinery ordering were all handled by the supply agencies of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, forming a package contract, which reduced the effect of correctly organizing the supply and marketing work and the sense of responsibility of the direct obligation fulfillers in signing partial contracts. The machine ordering only directly signed partial contracts between the supply and demand sides, and the central supply and marketing agency was not included in the contract relationship system, losing the role of the central agency in the contract established by its subordinate agencies. That is, the procurement of imported equipment has not established close contact with the trade department to sign an overall contract with it, so in the actual implementation process, the supply cannot be guaranteed, and the phenomenon of production enterprises stopping work and waiting for materials often occurs.

　　Fourth, the contract conditions are not strictly stipulated, the delivery and payment deadlines are not clear, and the material responsibilities that should be borne when the contract cannot be fulfilled are not strictly stipulated. It is not possible to supervise the fulfillment of the obligations of both parties through currency, so that it cannot attract enough attention from the fulfillers in the execution. As a result, behaviors that violate contract discipline have occurred, such as canceling the contract halfway, changing the number of orders, refusing to pay, and handing over non-compliant orders, and using accumulated secondary materials to perfunctorily fulfill the responsibility. The Ministry of Heavy Industry has not formulated a systematic method for supervising contracts, which has caused the contract to become lax.

　　The unclear responsibilities and unclear facts that have occurred above are due to the fact that today's production conditions cannot fully meet the requirements of both supply and demand, and on the other hand, it is due to the fact that a highly responsible attitude has not yet been developed for the implementation of contracts. The main reason is that the leading authorities have not checked in a timely manner, discovered problems and solved difficulties at any time, and failed to study and analyze the situation and summarize experience in a timely manner to give effective guidance to subordinate agencies. Therefore, many important issues concerning contractual relationships have not been resolved for a long time, creating conditions for the phenomenon of not doing things according to contracts.

　　(III)
　　The October ordering is coming soon, and we are going to sign the ordering contract for 1951. The major task before us is to check and analyze the errors and shortcomings that occurred when signing the contract in 1950, actively carry out the main preparatory work, consider the new basic conditions for product supply, and make extremely meticulous regulations. Serious investigation and research, grasp the specific situation, what are the products of those regional enterprises? What are the needs of those consumer departments? Is the transportation condition convenient? How close is the distance between the supply and demand sides? These are the scope that we should consider and prepare for. Especially today's industry has not yet embarked on the unified leadership of the profession, regionality still exists, the environment is different, the requirements are different, and a single link is broken, which will affect the overall situation. Such a complex ordering organization still needs to be presided over and led by the central material distribution agency for the time being, according to the economic plan, the actual requirements of the consumer departments, convene a material distribution meeting, formulate an economic supply plan, and instruct various ministries, bureaus and regions to implement it. The supply and demand sides must deeply understand the importance of the composition of the contractual relationship in accordance with the tasks instructed by the state, so as to well undertake the task of correctly organizing the supply and marketing work.

　　The composition of the basic contractual relationship must be through the form of overall contracts, partial contracts, and direct contracts. The supply conditions of the contract must be specific and clear, stipulating the types and specifications of the supplied products, the definite quantity, the supply deadline (total deadline, quarterly deadline, specific delivery date), the product price and total amount, the packaging and transportation responsibility, the place of shipment and delivery, the tax burden, the settlement method, the liability for losses caused by natural disasters, the material guarantee that the contract cannot be fulfilled, and the conditions for signing overall contracts and partial contracts separately, so as to consolidate the contract basis and ensure the integrity of the contract.

　　Once the contract is signed, it must be handled in accordance with the contract. In order to ensure the seriousness of the contract and the smooth progress of the contract signing, the establishment of an effective national arbitration agency or mediation agency is very necessary. The regular conduct of inspection work by the leading authorities is also an effective method to ensure the correct execution of the contract. Disputes and problems caused by failure to fulfill contractual obligations that occur in the performance and signing of the contract can be dealt with in a timely and appropriate manner, so that violations of contract discipline are subject to severe sanctions and due material responsibilities. Through the execution of discipline and the supervisory role of currency, a high degree of contract credibility can be maintained, making the contract an actual and effective document.

　　The advance reserves of national raw materials to ensure supply are a prerequisite for the timely realization of contracts. In 1950, various production enterprises only started purchasing materials from abroad after receiving orders and obtaining deposits. The short time and untimely supply caused serious consequences of suspension of work and waiting for materials, which greatly affected the production of enterprises and hindered the appropriate utilization of production capacity and technical conditions, so that the goods could not be delivered on time and the credibility of the contract was undermined. Therefore, the main raw materials must be raised by the state in a unified manner and reserved in advance to ensure the normal progress of production and the timely supply of products.

　　The settlement of contractual financial relations must be through the state bank, so that the state bank becomes the center of settlement and transfer, and becomes the hub of state-owned enterprises and economic organizations, and establishes a credit relationship between the bank and the enterprise, and consolidates the economic accounting system through the financial supervision role of the bank. Promote and strengthen the concern of each enterprise and economic organization in completing contract tasks, rationalizing production, and reducing costs and accumulating funds.

　　Today, the focus of industrial recovery and development is heavy industry. The heavy industry department should pay high attention to ordering contracts in order to complete tasks according to the plan; it should go through the connection of planning, economic accounting and contracts; and through the signing of overall contracts, partial contracts and direct contracts, make the contracts steadily penetrate into the actual economic relations. Expand the scope of contracts, improve the role of contracts, and organize correct supply and marketing relationships to consolidate the foundation of the heavy industry economic plan and fight for the realization of the heavy industry economic plan.

　　订货制在重工业经济计划中的作用
    张大颠
　　（一）
　 订货合同，是工业企业与产品供销机构之间经济关系的一种形式，有计划有组织的产品供应与推销，必须通过一系列的订货合同来实现。重工业部合同制的实行，是从本年二月份钢铁电机的订货开始的，以后机器定货也采取了合同形式。在执行合同的过程中，已深刻的体验到合同制的重要意义，它在组织供销，推动生产，完成工业计划等方面，都起了应有的作用。
　 合同的签定是根据计划进行的，一九四九年十一月全国重工业会议，确定了重工业恢复与建设的方针，制定了重工业经济计划。供销机关便根据工业计划的生产计划与各消费部门所提出的申请书和订货单，编制了产销平衡计划，这一计划的基本供应条件，经各消费部门同意并经政府批准之后，便成为签订产品供销合同的基础。在这个基础上，重工业经济计划的实现，经过合同的组织，就得到了有力的保证。
　 合同制度在重工业部一开始便采取了总体合同，局部合同，与直接合同三种基本形式。它的内容，包括了中央各部的产品供应合同，公私营企业的相互供应合同，所属企业的产品交换合同，进口器材的采购合同，私营企业的加工订货合同。这一系列不同形式，不同性质合同的签订，使各企业与各经济机关在合同的基础上，建立起新的供销关系。合同已稳步的深入到实际经济关系中去。
　 各区经济条件不一，因之产品售价就不可能趋于一致。为了调剂各区产品的售价，产品供应就采取了由供应机构统一与消费部门签订总体合同，再与各区分别签订局部合同的形式，以适当的调剂地区产品的差价。采购合同是采取了先与各区签订局部合同，以稳定其签订合同的信心，直接合同则具体的与进口部门签订。交换合同是由各区直接签订的，并规定了双方的互惠条件。为了照顾私营工业的生产所签订的加工订货合同，是由华东与当地私营企业直接进行的。这样经过合同的组织，各经济机关、国营企业与私营企业之间的相互关系，更加明晰化与具体化。不仅生产企业可以按照生产图表正确的进行生产，消费部门用于经济建设的原料机械的来源得到保障，并有助于供销机关商品流转计划的完成。合同是组织生产企业与消费企业相互关系的枢纽，是防止生产上的停工与供销上中断的关键。
　 合同根据产销平衡计划，详细的规定出各企业供应给各经济机关产品的种类，数量，品质，交货期限及包装运输等方面的各项义务，并确定这些义务的履行方法，不能按照合同履行义务时所应负的责任，使各经济机关与各企业的计划，用合同的形式固定下来，任务就可能具体化了。企业可以按照固定的生产计划正常的进行生产，各经济机关在恢复交通工矿，建设农林水利等所需用的物资及时得到供应，并对恢复与发展机器，电机的生产更具有重要的意义。经过订货任务的分配，使全国的机器业，电机制造业，在现状维持与半停顿状态下走上新生的道路。还适当的组织了私营企业的定货分配，给他们一定任务，使其加工制造，发挥私营工业生产力量为经济建设服务。这样国营经济与私营经济分工合作，共同发展生产，合同是起着积极组织与推动的作用，成为完成经济计划而斗争的有力武器。
　 过去各地区各企业在经济上很少发生联系，相互间不够了解，严重的存在着生产没有对象，产品没有销售市场，这一地区的产品积压，而另一地区则无法解决，急于进口，供销失调，产销脱节的现象。合同签订后，多年来互不了解的情况得以沟通，各地区企业的生产情况，技术条件相互都有了深刻的认识。更主要的是发现了各种精密制品，如东北的高速钢，镍铬钢，硬质合金等，上海的电工器材，精密机械等，西南的测量仪器，精密量具等。这些精密制品都可以自己制造，不必再依赖进口；很多种的钢铁、电机，机器都可以自己生产，不必再行在市场上去追逐外货。由于签订合同的结果，各区的产品的结算在相互调拨中，尽量相互清偿、中抵，使其平衡，避免了大批货币在市场上的流通。在外汇的使用上也作到了统一与集中。凡国内不能解决或产量不够应用的主要原材料，如矽钢片，电解铜，生胶电极等，由供应机关统一采购，有计划有重点的进行，避免了各区在采购上的分散与盲目的储备。这样适当的组织供销，是有利于物价稳定的，同时可以节省外汇，减少财政开支和现金支付，增加国民收益。合同便成为克服盲目生产盲目供销的有效工具与控制市场，掌握物价，避免中间剥削的物质基础。
　 订货任务由于有组织的分配承制，进一步促使生产趋向合理分工，和有计划有步骤的进行，在生产能力与技术条件上也获得了充分的发挥与提高，大部都能按时与提前交货。因为供应方面在接收订货后，即合理的组织其生产能力，改善生产设备，妥善的利用原材料燃料，计划资金周转和定货收入的运用，使产品成本一再降低。从订货到现在，华北钢材成本降低百分之一九，生铁降低百分之一八·一，电动机降低百分之九，变压器降低百分之十，水泥降低百分之一七·四；华东钢材降低百分之一七，成本降低便提高了各消费部门的购买力。合同能帮助企业发现其潜在的生产能力，巩固企业的经济核算制度，对降低成本，消灭浪费现象是一个有力的物质刺激。
　 因此合同制的实际意义，在于它能适当的组织产品供销，加速商品流转，提高生产能力，巩固经济核算，消灭浪费，增加资金积累，提前完成与超过完成国家计划。计划、经济核算，合同三者的联系及其统一，便成为加强经济计划基础，完成经济计划的实际力量。
　 （二）
　 签订合同这件事在重工业部来说是一件新鲜的事物，还在走着摸索的道路，虽然在执行过程中获得了一些成绩，但还存在着一些严重的问题。
　 第一、由于经验缺乏准备不足，需用部门不能按照所提出的申请书与订货单履行合同的手续，订货数量迟疑不决，不能提出具体规格及实样，既定数量一再缩减，甚至取消订货。承制部门则不能确定交货期限，提不出产品售价，规格质量也不能肯定保证。在这些问题的纠缠下，便拖延了签订合同的时间与打破了原定计划的完整性。个别承制部门的整体观念不够，没有明确的认识生产建设，存在着浓厚的商业性的经济意识，不肯拿出真实成本，而斤斤于价格的争执，亦大大的妨碍了合同的顺利推进。
　 第二、目前工业多在恢复时期，经济建设方始初步着手，对全面工业情况了解很差，缺乏生产数字的正确统计，掌握不住生产的特点与规律。往往使用部门上半年需用多，下半年需用少，承制部门则恰恰与此相反，致使产销不能均衡。有时更由于对潜在生产能力的发挥，没有充分的估计，使生产能力提高后，超计划完成的产品得不到及时的销售，形成了产品的积压，迟滞了资金的周转。
　 第三、未能按照正确合同关系的构成去组织订货，钢铁电机订货所签订的总体合同与局部合同均系经由重工业部供应机关所一手包办的，形成了一揽子性质的包揽合同，减低了正确组织供销工作的效果与直接义务履行者签订局部合同的责任心。而机器订货则仅由供需双方直接签订了局部合同，中央供销机关并未包括在合同关系的体系中，失去了中央机构在其下级机构订立合同方面所发生的作用。即进口器材的采购，也未与贸易部门取得密切联系与之签订总体合同，因而在实际执行过程中，便得不到供应的保证，经常引起生产企业发生停工待料的现象。
　 第四、合同条件规定得不严密，交货付款期限不明确，没有严格规定出不能按照合同履行义务时所应负的物质责任，不能通过货币来监督双方的义务履行情况，以致在执行当中不能引起履行者足够的注意。因而便发生了中途废约，变更定货数字，拒绝付款和交出不合规格的定货，以积存的次料塞责等破坏合同纪律的行为。重工业部亦未制定出有系统的对合同监督的方法，遂使合同的进行发生了松弛现象。
　 以上所发生的责任不明，事理不清的情形，一方面是由于今天的生产条件还不可能充分满足供需双方的要求，一方面是由于对合同的执行还未养成高度认真负责的态度。而主要的是领导机关未能及时的检查，随时发现问题，解决困难，未能及时研究分析情况，总结经验，给予下级机构以有力的指导。因此有许多关于合同关系的重要问题，长期不得解决，便给不按照合同办事的现象，创造了条件。
　　（三）
　 十月订货即将到来，我们又要签订一九五一年的订货合同了。摆在我们面前的重大任务，便是检查分析一九五○年签订合同时所发生的错误和缺点，积极进行主要的筹备工作，考虑产品供应新的基本条件，进行极缜密的规定。认真的调查研究，掌握住具体情况，那些地区企业的产品是什么？那些消费部门的需要是什么？运输条件便利与否？供需双方距离的接近程度如何？都是我们应当考虑与准备的范围。尤其今天的工业还未走上专业的统一领导，地区性依然存在，所处环境不同，要求各异，一环脱节，就会影响全局。像这样复杂的订货组织，暂时还须由中央物资分配机关主持领导，依据经济计划，消费部门的实际要求，召开物资分配会议，制定经济供应计划，指示各部局各地区贯彻执行。供需双方必须按照国家指示的任务，深深地认识合同关系构成的重要，才能很好的担负起正确组织供销工作的任务。
　 合同基本关系的构成，必须通过总体合同、局部合同、直接合同的形式。合同的供应条件，务须具体明确，规定出供应产品的种类规格，确实数量，供应期限（总期限，分季期限，具体交货的月日）产品价格及总金额，包装与运输责任，起运及送达地点，税款负担，结算办法，天灾人祸的损失责任，不能履行合同的物质保证，以及总体合同与局部合同分别签订的条件等，以巩固合同基础，保证合同的完整性。
　 合同既经签订，一定要根据合同办理。为了保证合同的严肃性及合同签订的顺利进行，有效的国家仲裁机构或调解机构的成立是非常必要的。而领导机关检查工作的经常进行亦是保证合同正确执行的有效方法。在履行及签订合同中，双方发生的争执和不履行合同义务所引起的问题，可以及时而适当的得到处理，使违犯合同纪律的行为受到严峻的处分与应负的物质责任，通过纪律的执行与货币的监督作用，就可以保持合同高度信用，使合同成为实际的有效文件。
　 国家原材料的提前储备，保证供应，是合同按期实现的先决条件，一九五○年各生产企业在接收订货取得定金后，才开始进行国外购料，时间短促，供不及时，造成停工待料的严重后果，大大影响了企业的生产，妨碍了生产能力与技术条件的适当发挥，以致不能按期交货，破坏了合同的信用。因此主要原材料一定要由国家统一筹措，提前储备，以保证生产的正常进行与产品的按期供应。
　 合同财务关系的结算，必须通过国家银行，使国家银行成为结算与转账的中心，成为国营企业与经济机关的枢纽，并建立起银行与企业的信贷关系，通过银行的财政监督作用来巩固经济核算制。促进并加强每个企业和经济机关在完成合同任务方面，生产合理化方面，以及降低成本，积累资金方面的关心。
　 今天工业的恢复与发展的重点是重工业，重工业部门要按照计划完成任务，应对订货合同提起高度的注意；应经过计划，经济核算合同三者的联系；经过总体合同，局部合同直接合同的签订，使合同稳步的深入到实际的经济关系中去。扩大合同的范围，提高合同的作用，组织起正确的供销关系，以巩固重工业经济计划的基础，为重工业经济计划的实现而斗争。
