    Comrade Zhao Zhenjiang is a storeman in the Sixth Branch of the Fifth General Warehouse of the Logistics Department of the North China Military Region. He is a model warehouse worker. He has high work enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility. In recent years, he has played a significant role in protecting military supplies and supporting the War of Liberation and was selected as a meritorious warehouse worker.
    Comrade Zhao Zhenjiang is from Lincheng County, Hebei Province, a member of the Chinese Communist Party, and is twenty-eight years old this year. He joined the army in 1939 and established many merits in the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the People's Liberation War, he was in charge of ordnance and warehouse work, further demonstrating the spirit of self-sacrifice of a Communist Party member.
    During the battle to liberate Taiyuan, he was responsible for receiving, storing, and distributing ammunition transported from the rear at Shouyang Railway Station in Shanxi. He worked day and night, often forgetting to sleep and eat. At that time, the situation was very tense, and enemy planes constantly circled over the station, attempting to destroy our military supply. Therefore, ammunition had to be transported after dark, unloaded from the train, and then dispersed and concealed in various villages overnight to avoid being detected by enemy planes. It was winter, and the northwest wind cut people's faces like knives. Comrade Zhao Zhenjiang stayed at the station until late every night in such cold weather, waiting for the train to arrive, unloading the ammunition, and then mobilizing carts to transport it to various villages. Sometimes, the train arrived too late, and no carts could be found. After the ammunition was unloaded, he and other comrades had to personally stand guard until the carts transported it away. Sometimes, everyone was too tired. He told others to sleep and did the work himself. Because of overwork, he fell ill: coughing up blood and having diarrhea. But all this could not stop his work; he persisted. All the ammunition was safely delivered to the soldiers besieging Taiyuan.
    After the liberation of Taiyuan, he accepted a new task: to collect and store military supplies in the Shuangta Temple and Nuoma River areas on the outskirts of the city. He worked day and night with five carts. In order to quickly collect and store some useful materials to prevent losses, in addition to directing the carts, he also took the lead in carrying, loading, and unloading. At this time, he was still ill, often coughing up blood and having diarrhea. He couldn't eat, but he ignored all this. The leaders advised him to rest, but he refused to listen. They gave him money and asked him to go to the edge of the city to buy something to nourish his body, but he was afraid of delaying work and refused to go. In this way, he fought illness while desperately working, persisting for more than twenty days and finally completing the task satisfactorily.
    In the winter of 1949, the Sixth Branch of the Fifth General Warehouse carried out a major warehouse reorganization. He was still ill, but insisted on participating in this work. He was in charge of more than twenty carts. He set off before dawn and returned after the lights were lit. This happened every day. For the sake of work, he completely forgot about fatigue and illness. When moving black explosives, some comrades disliked the dirt and the unpleasant smell, so he took the lead, getting himself covered in black, with only his teeth being white. When carrying boxes of ammunition to a place eight miles away, other comrades carried twelve boxes each, but he carried eight boxes himself. At this time, his diarrhea became even worse. Sometimes, while carrying boxes, he would unknowingly leak excrement; but in order not to affect work, he stuffed cotton into his anus and continued to carry and transport. Once, it rained heavily. He was afraid that the warehouse would leak, so he stood in the heavy rain with a burlap sack on his head until the rain stopped. After inspecting the warehouse, he returned with peace of mind.

　　模范仓库工作者赵振江同志
    梅村
    赵振江同志是华北军区后勤军械部第五总库第六分库的库员，是一位模范仓库工作者。他具有高度的工作热情和责任心。几年来，他在保护军用物资，支援解放战争方面发挥了很大的作用，曾被选为仓库工作功臣。
    赵振江同志是河北临城县人，中共党员，今年二十八岁。他于一九三九年入伍，曾在抗日战争中建立了许多功绩。在人民解放战争中，他担任军械、仓库工作，更表现了共产党员的自我牺牲精神。
    在解放太原的战役中，他在山西寿阳车站接收、保管和分发由后方运去的弹药。他不分昼夜地工作着，经常忘记睡眠和吃饭。那时，情况十分紧张，敌机每天不断地在车站上空盘旋，企图破坏我们的军需供应。因此，弹药必须在天黑以后运去，卸下火车后，再连夜分散掩蔽到各个村子，免得被敌机发觉。那时正是冰天雪地，西北风刮到人的脸上，像刀子割一般。赵振江同志就在这样寒冷的天气，每天晚上在车站守到深夜，等火车到了，把弹药卸下来，再动员大车运到各村。有时，火车到得太晚，找不到大车了，弹药卸下后，只好暂时放在车站上，他就和其他同志亲自放哨，直到大车把它运走。有时，大家太疲倦了，他叫别人睡觉，自己一个人去干。因为操劳过度，他病了：吐血，泻肚。但这一切，都不能阻止他的工作，他一直坚持着。运到的弹药都安全地送到了围攻太原的战士手里。
    太原解放后，他又接受了新的任务：到城郊双塔寺、淖马河一带收集、存放军用品。他一个人带着五辆大车，不分昼夜地忙碌着。为了迅速把一些有用的物资收集存放起来，使不受损失，他除指挥大车外，还亲自带头搬运，装卸。这时，他仍在病中，时常吐血，泻肚。饭也不能吃，但他不顾这一切。领导上劝他休息，他不听；给他钱叫他到城边去买东西补养身体，他怕耽误工作，不肯去。就这样，他一面和疾病搏斗，一面拚命地工作，坚持了二十多天，终于完满地完成了任务。
    一九四九年冬天，第五总库六分库进行大倒库。他仍在病中，但坚持要参加这一工作。他一人掌握着二十几辆大车，天没有亮就出发，上灯后才回来。天天如此。他为了工作，根本忘记了疲劳和疾病。倒黑色炸药时，有的同志嫌脏，嫌气味难受，他就带头干，弄得浑身漆黑，只有牙齿是白的。往八里地外一个地方搬弹药箱子时，别的同志两个人抬十二箱，他一个人就挑八箱。这时，肚子泻得更厉害了，有时正担着箱子奔走，屎水子不知不觉就流出来；但为了不影响工作，他用棉花把肛门塞住，仍继续挑运。有一次下大雨，他怕库房漏雨，就顶一片麻袋立在大雨中看着，直到雨停了，把仓库检查一遍，才放心地回去。
