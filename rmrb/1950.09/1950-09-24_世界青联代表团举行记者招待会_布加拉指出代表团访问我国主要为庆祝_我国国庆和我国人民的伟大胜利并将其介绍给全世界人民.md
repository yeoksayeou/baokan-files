At the conference, the head of the delegation, Bugala, first introduced the representatives of the delegation. He then pointed out that the delegation's visit to China is mainly to celebrate the National Day of the People's Republic of China, cheer the great victory of the Chinese people, and introduce the great achievements of the Chinese people to the people and youth of all countries in the world. He emphasized that just as American imperialism is carrying out provocations in the Far East and brazenly invading Korea and Taiwan, the delegation will tell the youth of all countries about the firm will and powerful strength of the Chinese people and youth to defend peace.

Talking about his impression of visiting Northeast China, Bugala praised the efforts and achievements made by the people and youth of Northeast China in building the motherland. He also praised the machines and technical assistance given by the Soviet Union to China's construction cause. Bugala finally said excitedly that the delegation will tell the democratic youth of all countries in the world that in the struggle for lasting world peace, Chinese youth are their most trustworthy comrades.
