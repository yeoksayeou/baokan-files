　　Adopting New Tax Collection Methods Leads to Proactive Work
    Beijing's Second Quarter Business Tax Nearing Completion
    Deed Tax Rates Reduced Compared to Before, But Tax Evasion Remains Serious
    [This newspaper reports] According to the Beijing Municipal News Bureau: Since the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau began improving the collection methods for industrial and commercial taxes in late May, it has achieved some success, and the work has shifted from passive to active. In three months, not only has the tax payment work for the spring business tax of this year been basically completed, but the summer business tax collection is also nearing completion. For the city's more than 38,000 industrial and commercial households, starting from July of this year, business tax can be calculated and collected monthly based on the principle of "calculating and collecting according to rates," using methods such as "self-reporting, checking accounts, and calculating and collecting according to rates," "self-reporting, public discussion, democratic assessment, combined with checking accounts," and "regular fixed amounts."

    Since liberation, Beijing has adopted democratic assessment methods for collecting industrial and commercial taxes three times (the second half of 1948, the first half of 1949, and the second half of 1949). As tax officials' collection experience has gradually become richer, and industrialists' and merchants' understanding of tax payment has gradually increased, the Beijing Tax Bureau decided, when carrying out the spring business tax collection work this year, to adopt "self-reporting, public discussion, democratic assessment, combined with checking accounts" for large households with accounts, and "fixed amounts on a regular basis based on self-reporting, public discussion, and democratic assessment" for small households without accounts, based on the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Taxes promulgated by the Government Administration Council in February.

    In late May, the Municipal Tax Bureau first concentrated cadres in the jurisdictions of the First and Sixth Tax Sub-bureaus to carry out the work of "self-reporting" business volume for industrial and commercial households, and after gaining experience, it was carried out universally in various tax sub-bureaus throughout the city. This collection involved first self-reporting the spring business volume (calculated in currency), which was then democratically assessed by industrial and commercial groups, and the amount of tax payable by each household was calculated according to the tax rate. Tax payments from various industrial and commercial households have been paid into the treasury successively since late June and are now 91 percent complete. In order to quickly shift the work to a proactive state, the summer business tax collection was arranged to begin on July 18 and was collected in the same way as in the spring. Households using the "self-reporting and public discussion" method reported their summer business volume, while households with "regular fixed amounts" individually adjusted their tax payable based on the spring tax payable. The work proceeded smoothly, and the number of payments into the treasury is now 77 percent complete.

    The city's industrial and commercial sectors generally welcomed the new tax collection methods, and generally said: "With self-reporting and account checking, we have a bottom line, we know how much tax to pay based on how much business we do, and we dare to do it." Of course, because tax officials still lack experience with the new methods, there are still some shortcomings in the work, and the main one is that some merchants are still not truthfully reporting their business volume. This phenomenon has been discovered in various tax sub-bureaus. For example, the Fourth Tax Sub-bureau discovered that Tonghua Shun Construction Factory on Baochan Temple Street concealed a business volume of 1.08 billion yuan worth of steel bars, evading more than 27.3 million yuan in spring business tax. The Sixth Tax Sub-bureau recently checked the accounts of only 633 industrial and commercial households, and 149 of them were found to have tax evasion, with the unreported summer business volume averaging 35 percent of the original declared amount; the most serious case was Juxingcheng, a dried fruit and seafood business, which exceeded the original declared amount by more than 22 times. These illegal acts of a few individuals in evading taxes not only affect national fiscal revenue, but also affect the further balancing of the burden on the city's industrial and commercial sectors. The Municipal Tax Bureau will severely punish those who repeatedly fail to correct their behavior in accordance with the law, and will further deepen its inspection.

    Due to the success of the new tax collection methods for spring and summer business taxes, Beijing's tax work has now shifted from being passive since liberation to being active. The city's industrial and commercial tax for July will soon be levied. Industrial and commercial enterprises with sound accounting systems that can be used as evidence for collection will adopt the "self-reporting, checking accounts, and calculating and collecting according to rates" method, while the industrial and commercial tax for "regular fixed amount" households in the second half of the year, including income tax, will also be fixed from July. In this way, the complex industrial and commercial tax, except for the income tax of industrial and commercial households using the "self-reporting and account checking" and "self-reporting and public discussion" methods, which is estimated and levied once every six months with refunds for overpayments and supplements for underpayments, the other parts can all be calculated and collected monthly according to the tax rate, which solves the difficulty for industrialists and merchants in raising tax funds in a concentrated manner.

    [Another report] Beijing's deed tax is now being levied according to the new Provisional Regulations on Deed Tax passed by the Government Administration Council, and its tax rate has been reduced compared to before. For example, the tax rate for sales deeds and gift deeds used to be 7.5 percent, but now it has been changed to 6 percent. The tax rate for mortgage deeds has been reduced from 5 percent to 3 percent, and the tax rate for partition deeds used to be 2.5 percent, but now it has been completely exempted.

    The general public mostly recognizes that the new method's tax rates, whether light or heavy, take into account the people's burden and are "reasonable to take from," and they automatically pay deed tax on time. However, some individual citizens still try to evade taxes by using tricky methods such as concealing prices and using "red envelopes." According to a recent investigation by the Finance Bureau, Dejuyong Grain Store in Dongzhushikou concealed a total of 9.4 million yuan in deed price in two instances. There are also households that evade taxes and conceal information by using "red envelopes." That is, they buy real estate without paying tax and then sell it to others. Some homebuyers, in addition to buying real estate, also have other rights or offset debts, but when applying for deed tax, they only report the house price, and conceal their rights, value, or debt amount, forming a disguised concealment of price.

    All tax-evading owners who have been exposed, after being verified by the Finance Bureau, have been punished according to Articles 12 and 13 of the Provisional Regulations on Deed Tax; and appropriate education and criticism have been given to intermediaries, brokers, owners, and all accomplices, or they have been ordered to publish repentance in newspapers.

    In order to thoroughly investigate tax evaders, the Municipal Finance Bureau hopes that all citizens will help report them, and has specially formulated measures to reward those who report tax evasion: Those who report tax evasion and are found to be true will receive 30 percent of the fine as a reward.

### 采用新办法征税工作走向主动  京二季营业税接近完成  契税税率较前减轻但逃税仍严重

　　采用新办法征税工作走向主动
    京二季营业税接近完成
    契税税率较前减轻但逃税仍严重
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：京市人民政府税务局自五月下旬开始改进工商业税的征收方法后，已取得一些成绩，工作已由被动走向主动。三个月中，不但基本上完成了本年度春季营业税的纳库工作，夏季的营业税征收已接近完成。全市三万八千余户的工商业税，自本年七月份开始，已可根据“按率计征”的原则，分别以“自报查账，依率计征”，“自报公议，民主评定，结合查账”，与“定期定额”等三种方法逐月计征营业税。
    京市自解放以来，曾三次采用民主评议的办法征收工商业税（一九四八年下半年，一九四九年上半年和下半年），由于税务工作人员征收经验已逐渐丰富，工商业者对纳税的认识也逐步提高，所以京市税局在进行本年春季营业税征收工作时，根据政务院二月份颁布的工商业税暂行办法，决定对有账大户采用“自报公议、民主评定、结合查账”；对无账小户用“在自报公议、民主评定基础上定期定额”这两种方法。
    在五月下旬，市税局曾首先集中干部在第一、第六两个税务分局辖区内进行工商业户“自报”营业额的工作，取得经验后，再在全市各税务分局普遍进行。这次征收，都是首先自报春季营业额（以货币计算），经工商业小组进行民主评议后，按照税率计算出各户应纳的税额。各工商户税款，自六月下旬起陆续纳库，现已完成百分之九十一。为使工作迅速转入主动，夏季营业税在七月十八日即开始布置，仍按春季的办法进行征收。“自报公议”户申报夏季营业额，“定期定额”户则在春季应纳税额基础上个别调整，工作进行很顺利，现纳库数字已有百分之七十七。
    全市工商业界对新的征税办法普遍表示欢迎，一般的都说：“申报查账我们有了底，知道做多少买卖纳多少税，我们敢做了。”当然，由于税务工作人员对于新方法的经验还不够，工作也还存在一些缺点，而主要的是某些商人申报营业额尚有不真实现象。这种现象在各税务分局都有发现，如税务第四分局查出宝禅寺街桐华顺营造厂匿报一笔价值十亿八千万元的钢铁筋的营业额，偷漏春季营业税二千七百三十余万元。税务第六分局最近只检查了六百三十三家工商户的账目，其中便有一百四十九户有漏税情形，漏报夏季营业额平均占原申报额百分之三十五；漏报最多的如干果海味业聚兴诚号，超过原申报额达二十二倍以上。这些少数分子偷漏税款的不法行为，不但影响国家财政收入，也影响到全市工商业负担的进一步平衡，市税务局对屡教不改者将依法予以严惩，并进一步深入检查。
    由于春、夏两季营业税采用新征收方法的成功，京市税务工作现已自解放以来的被动走向主动。全市七月份的工商业税最近即将开征，有健全的会计制度可以作为征收确据的工商企业，将采用“自报查账，依率计征”的方法，而下半年度“定期定额”户的工商业税，亦将包括所得税从七月份起全部固定下来。这样一来，繁杂的工商业税，除采用“自报查账”、“自报公议”两种方法的工商业户的所得税半年估征一次、多退少补外，其他部分都已可以逐月按照税率计征，而解决了工商业者集中筹措税款的困难。
    【又讯】京市契税已按政务院通过新的契税暂行条例征收，其税率已比以前减轻了。例如：买卖契、赠与契的税率以前均为百分之七·五，现在改为百分之六，典契由百分之五减为百分之三，分割契过去是百分之二·五，现在全部减免了。
    一般市民多认识到新办法的税率轻重是照顾到了人民负担，是“取之合理”的，都自动按期投契税。但也有个别市民依然用瞒价、顶红等取巧办法企图逃税。近据财政局调查，如东珠市口德聚永粮店一家两次即匿报契价共九百四十万元。还有的户顶红逃税和隐匿不报。即买到房产不投税，再出卖给他人。有的买房人除了购买房产以外，同时尚有其他权利或者抵偿债务，但在报请契税时，却只报房价，将其权利、价值或债权数额隐匿不报，形成变相匿价。
    凡已被揭发的偷税业主，经财政局调查属实后，已根据契税暂行条例第十二、十三两条给以处罚；并对中人、纤手、业主和一切同谋人给以适当的教育批评或令其登报悔过。
    为了彻底清查偷税逃税的分子，市财政局希望全体市民帮助检举，并特别制订了奖励检举逃税的办法：凡检举查获逃避契税属实者，将罚金提出百分之三十做为奖金给检举人。
