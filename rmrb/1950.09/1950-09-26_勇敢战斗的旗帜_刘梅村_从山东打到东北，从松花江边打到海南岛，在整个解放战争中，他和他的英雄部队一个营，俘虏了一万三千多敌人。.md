　　The Banner of Courageous Fighting - Liu Meicun
　　From Shandong to the Northeast, from the banks of the Songhua River to Hainan Island, throughout the entire Liberation War, he and his heroic unit, a battalion, captured more than 13,000 enemies.

　　Liu Meicun is now an instructor in the Fourth Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Since he joined the revolution, he has always been a good soldier of Mao Zedong. In 1940, when the Japanese invaders trampled across the Ji-Lu Plain, in order to oppose the enslavement of the Japanese invaders, he organized an anti-Japanese guerrilla force on the banks of the Xiaoqing River, and persisted in the struggle for two years under extremely difficult conditions with enemy and puppet blockhouses everywhere! They endured hunger and cold, living in the sorghum fields during the day, eating raw grain and raw melon vegetables. They conducted guerrilla activities at night. Later, he was arrested and imprisoned, but he remained unyielding. After his release, he immediately returned to the revolutionary ranks and joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1944. In the spring of the following year, he mobilized one hundred and eighty young people and led them to join the main force of the Eighth Route Army.

　　From Shandong to the Northeast, from the banks of the Songhua River to Hainan Island. He participated in more than forty battles. "Defending Siping," "Liberating Changchun," "Three Offensives South of the Songhua River," "Siping Siege," "Liberating Anshan and Liaoyang," "Liberating Jinzhou," "Liaoxi Campaign," "Liberating Tianjin," "Pursuit and Annihilation Campaign on the Guangdong-Guangxi Border," "Liberating Hainan Island"... Liu Meicun and his heroic troops undertook the main attack missions in almost all of these major battles. Throughout the entire Liberation War, this battalion of his captured more than 13,000 enemies.

　　In the bloody battles, he was wounded eight times and became a second-class disabled soldier. But he never spent a day in the hospital. He made one special contribution, two major contributions, and two minor contributions to the people. He received the honorary titles of "Combat Model," "Model Instructor," and "Combat Hero."

　　The heroic achievements are so brilliant, the heroic stories are so vivid, but the most representative battle of the hero is the cruel Siping siege in the summer offensive of 1947!

　　One

　　Company Three Instructor Liu Meicun felt the weight of the responsibility after receiving the mission. He understood very well that capturing Siping and isolating the Chiang bandits in Changchun was a very important move in expanding the victory of the summer offensive. Now, the brotherly column had opened a breakthrough in the southwest corner, and the troops entering the city were suffering stubborn resistance from the enemy. The troops could not spread out, and the forces of the three columns were all squeezed into the traffic trenches on the west side of the city. The enemy planes in the sky and the artillery in the city caused great casualties to the dense troops. If the battle was not resolved quickly, the enemy's powerful reinforcements would arrive, and the war situation would change greatly.

　　In front of him, a group of large bunkers extended out of the city a few hundred meters southwest of the breakthrough. A battalion of Chiang bandits was guarding there, and the flanking fire posed a great threat to the troops entering the breakthrough. The First Company attacked three times in the first half of the night, suffering seventy or eighty casualties without taking it down.

　　"The Third Company is the famous 'Tenacious Assault Company' in the entire division. Although both the company commander and deputy company commander were wounded, the glory of the Third Company must be maintained, and the tasks assigned by the higher-ups must be completed." Thinking of this, Liu Meicun decided to personally reconnoiter the terrain.

　　In the dark night where no one could be seen, Liu Meicun crawled across an open area and stopped behind two small trees, carefully observing by the light of the flares: the bunker complex was fifty or sixty meters away, with two large houses behind it, and a traffic trench connecting to the city. There was no barbed wire outside.

　　Liu Meicun crawled back and decided to attack from the enemy's flank and rear. He estimated that the enemy's forces must be concentrated on the front because the First Company had attacked three times on the front. He saw that the fortifications on the flank and rear were weak. Although it was an open area, it could be successful as long as a surprise attack tactic was adopted.

　　At two o'clock in the morning, Liu Meicun led a platoon and quietly crawled onto the open area. The flares in the sky went on and off. The soldiers crawled for a while and rested for a while. When they reached behind the two trees, he ordered Yue Quanzhong to blow up the gate, and ordered the Third Squad to insert into the traffic trench to prevent the enemy from escaping into the city from the trench.

　　Yue Quanzhong walked away with a satchel charge. Soon, there was a flash of lightning in front, and a thunderous explosion! Liu Meicun led the team and rushed into the two large houses like a whirlwind, quickly taking down the large central bunker.

　　The enemy fled in panic! A group of enemies ran into the traffic trench and were blocked and disarmed by the Third Squad. All seventy-odd bunkers were occupied. Liu Meicun looked at his watch and it was exactly fifteen minutes later. Checking the number of people, there were only two minor injuries.

　　Before dawn, Liu Meicun heard the regimental headquarters issuing a commendation on the telephone, awarding the First Company a collective first-class merit. A victorious smile appeared on his face.

　　Two

　　Early the next morning, planes bombed in low-altitude rotations, and the explosions of bombs and shells did not stop for a minute. The original breakthrough was not expanded, and the large troops were still squeezed on the edge of the city. The column leaders decided to open up a new breakthrough, and the task of a strong attack fell on the shoulders of the heroic company.

　　The attack point was chosen at the place where the bunker complex occupied last night connected to the city. The city wall was one and a half zhang high, with bunkers on and below the city wall. The outer moat, eight chi deep and wide, was constructed with concealed bunkers and plum blossom stakes, and the moat was surrounded by barbed wire.

　　Liu Meicun kept thinking about how to complete this arduous task: "The enemy has three layers of fire nets. A strong attack during the day without heavy firepower cover requires a very good organization of the troops."

　　At three o'clock in the afternoon, Liu Meicun waved the command flag, and heavy and light machine guns swept the top of the city like a storm. Sixty mortars were smoking on the bunkers. Three enemy planes circled at low altitude, and bombs rained down. Mortar shells and sixty mortars from the city fell like hail outside the city. The entire southwest corner was filled with thick smoke, and the gunpowder choked the nose. The second echelon could not see the first echelon.

　　The first demolition man followed the trench through the sea of ​​fire, broke into the barbed wire, and blew up the outer ditch of the city moat. The second demolition man took advantage of the smoke to blow up the inner ditch of the outer moat. The third demolition man blew up the bunker under the city!

　　Liu Meicun waved the red flag to the assault squad, and the soldiers of the Seventh Squad rushed through the traffic trench like flying arrows. Liu Meicun followed behind the Seventh Squad. Shells exploded around him, and bullets whizzed over his head. Liu Meicun waved the red flag, and subsequent troops rushed up.

　　The Seventh Squad rushed to the bottom of the city, inserted bayonets into the earthen wall, and climbed up one by one. Liu Meicun planted the red flag under the city and then went up. The enemy retreated in panic. Liu Meicun commanded the troops to pounce fiercely to the west, successively taking down seventeen city wall bunkers and capturing more than seventy enemies.

　　Three

　　At dusk, the heavy rain continued to fall. Liu Meicun received a new combat mission: attack the weather station! The Third Platoon stayed on the city wall to confront the enemy. Liu Meicun reorganized the remaining men from the First and Second Platoons into one platoon, preparing to attack when it got dark!

　　The weather station was a four-story building, surrounded by more than one hundred bunker complexes, which were strong firepower points for the enemy. It hindered the advance of the troops in the city and also hindered the city attack of another brotherly column outside the city. Liu Meicun's attack point was chosen at a small green building in the southeast corner of the weather station.

　　The explosives were all wet. Demolition man Wang Xiangting took a pair of pliers, felt his way in the dark, climbed to the barbed wire, and cut a door without the enemy noticing. When he climbed back, he met another demolition man, holding a pack of explosives that the regiment had just issued, to blow up the bunker outside the small green building. Wang Xiangting told him where he had cut it open, and then ran down quickly.

　　As soon as Wang Xiangting came back, he heard a bang in front! He quickly hugged the second pack of explosives, rushed through the blasted bunker and low wall, and pressed it against the small green building and pulled the fuse! A big hole was blown up in the small green building. Liu Meicun led the team to rush in. Most of the enemy fled, and only a few people were captured.

　　Liu Meicun decided to strike while the iron was hot. He personally reconnoitered the terrain of the weather station and decided to use his best trick - a surprise attack! He led the Fourth Squad, ignoring the enemy in the bunkers on both sides, quietly sneaked into the barbed wire he had just cut open during the reconnaissance, and quickly occupied the two large houses outside the weather station. Then he turned back and cleared the bunker complexes on both sides of the road.

　　Subsequent troops came up. Liu Meicun ordered Wang Xiangting to set off explosives. Wang Xiangting braved the enemy's grenades, passed under the building, pressed the explosives and pulled the fuse.

　　"Boom"! The assault squad rushed up. They turned a big circle downstairs and couldn't find a gap. They were thrown down rows of bombs from upstairs, and more than half of them were killed or injured. The rest hurriedly retreated.

　　"Damn! Ten catties of explosives are too little to blow up the cement wall!" Liu Meicun thought, "It's almost dawn. If we don't take it down tonight, the enemy will attack as soon as it gets light, and these two houses can't withstand a few sixty mortars!"

　　The messenger from the battalion headquarters came with an order, telling them to hold on until tomorrow night before attacking again. Liu Meicun asked him to report to the battalion leader that he was determined to take it down before dawn, and asked the battalion headquarters to give him a pack of explosives and some machine gun bullets.

　　A pack of twenty catties of explosives and seventy bullets were sent. Liu Meicun asked Wang Xiangting to choose a place on the brick wall to blow up. Under the cover of machine guns, Wang Xiangting rushed in again! After a while, there was a deafening explosion! Liu Meicun led the troops and drilled downstairs, capturing more than one hundred and thirty enemies.

　　Four

　　On the fourth afternoon, the anxiously awaited mission came down! The regimental leader wanted Liu Meicun to resolutely take down the Big Red Building in front.

　　Liu Meicun knew that the Big Red Building was the last major stronghold in Daoxi. If it was not cleared, it would not be possible to attack Daodong. He also knew that the fortifications of the Red Building were very strong and there were many enemies inside. But he didn't know that this was the headquarters of the 71st Army of the enemy, and the Special Service Regiment of the 71st Army lived inside.

　　The attack began. Demolition men braved the enemy's storm of artillery fire and carried out three consecutive demolitions. The barbed wire and bunkers were destroyed! A big hole was blown up in the Red Building. Wang Xiangting led the assault squad to rush downstairs and stabbed an enemy blocking the gap to death. Liu Meicun picked up the enemy's submachine gun, "Tut-tut" for a while, and drove the enemy behind him away!

　　Liu Meicun led a group of people to rush in. Enemy machine guns swept over frantically. The soldiers were crawling on the corridor and could not move forward. The enemy counterattacked wave after wave, like the tide, retreating and coming again. Grenades fell around and exploded like locusts. The faces of the soldiers were scorched black by the gunpowder. Most of a squad was killed or injured, and several of the reinforcing squad also fell.

　　"Comrades, we can only advance one chi, we must not retreat one inch!" Liu Meicun shouted at the top of his voice. He threw seventy or eighty grenades and heated up four rifles. He was hit by a bullet in the waist. But he continued to command the troops in silence.

　　At the critical moment, the connecting road was cut off by enemy fire. Grenades could not be transported up. The enemy carried out more than a dozen counterattacks and were all defeated! The ammunition was running out! Only seven or eight soldiers who were alive and able to fire a gun were left.

　　"We must open up another road!" After making up his mind, Liu Meicun immediately called two messengers back. The messengers braved life and death and carried two packs of explosives.

　　Li Yuquan carried the explosives and blew down a pile of walls. His foot was pierced by an iron nail. He pulled out the iron nail and went to blow up the second pile of walls.

　　The explosives exploded, the wooden wall caught fire, and the gasoline depot was burning. A burst of grenades flew from upstairs and exploded around Liu Meicun, and dozens of fragments hit his body. He lost consciousness.

　　It was getting dark. The Red Building was blazing with flames. The soldiers who could crawl struggled to crawl out. Deputy Platoon Leader Liu Zhenying endured the pain and tried his best to drag Liu Meicun out. More than 3,000 enemies upstairs were burned and ran down, and all, including Chen Mingxin, the head of the Special Service Regiment, were captured.

　　Liu Meicun and his heroic company completed five combat missions in a row in the five-day siege. It played a major role in the entire campaign. They defeated a regiment, two battalions, and two companies of the enemy, capturing more than 400 people. Of the 134 comrades in the entire company, 133 were killed or injured in the bloody battle. More than eighty people's meritorious servants emerged from the entire company. And he became a banner of courageous fighting in the Siping siege, becoming a famous combat hero in the entire army.

　　勇敢战斗的旗帜——刘梅村
    从山东打到东北，从松花江边打到海南岛，在整个解放战争中，他和他的英雄部队一个营，俘虏了一万三千多敌人。
    白刃
    刘梅村现在是中国人民解放军第四野战军一位教导员。从他参加革命，就一直是毛泽东的好战士。当一九四○年，日寇铁蹄踏遍冀鲁平原，为着反对日寇的奴役，在小清河边，他组织起抗日游击队，在敌伪碉堡林立、极端艰苦的环境下，坚持了两年的斗争！他们忍饥受寒，白天住在青纱帐中，吃着生谷米生瓜菜。黑夜进行游击活动。后来他被捕入狱，仍然不屈不挠。出狱后马上回到革命队伍，并在一九四四年参加中国共产党。第二年春天，他动员了一百八十个青年，领头参加了八路军主力部队。
    从山东打到东北，从松花江边打到海南岛。他参加了四十多次的战斗。“保卫四平”、“解放长春”、“三下江南”、“四平攻坚战”、“解放鞍山辽阳”、“解放锦州”、“辽西会战”、“解放天津”、“粤桂边追歼战”、“解放海南岛”……所有这些重大战役，刘梅村和他的英雄部队，差不多都担任着主要的攻击任务。整个解放战争中，他这个营，俘虏了一万三千多敌人。
    在血战中，他负伤八次，成为二等残废。但他没有住过一天医院。他为人民立了一特功、两大功和两小功。获得“战斗模范”、“模范指导员”和“战斗英雄”等光荣称号。
    英雄的功绩是那样辉煌，英雄的故事是那样生动，而最能代表英雄的战斗，要算一九四七年夏季攻势中，残酷的四平攻坚战！
    一
    三连指导员刘梅村接受了任务以后，深深感到责任的重大。他很明白，打下四平，孤立长春的蒋匪，是扩大夏季攻势胜利中，很重要的一着。现在，兄弟纵队在西南角打开一个突破口，进城的部队遭受敌人顽强的抵抗。队伍展不开，三个纵队的兵力，全挤在城西面交通沟里。天空的敌机和城内的大炮，给密集部队很大的杀伤。如果不迅速解决战斗，敌人强大援军一赶到，战争的局面就会起很大的变化。
    眼前，突破口的西南几百米，有个大地堡群伸出城外，一营的蒋匪守在那里，侧射的火力给进入突破口部队很大威胁。一连在上半夜攻击了三次，伤亡了七八十人没有拿下。
    “三连是全师有名的‘顽强冲杀连’，虽然正副连长都负伤了，可是三连的光荣一定要保持，上级的任务一定要完成。”刘梅村想到这里，决心亲自去侦察一下地形。
    对面不见人的黑夜里，刘梅村爬过一片开阔地，停在两棵小树后面，借着照明弹的亮光仔细观察：地堡群离这里五六十米远，后面有两间大房子，有条交通沟通到城里，外面没有铁丝网。
    刘梅村爬回来，决定从敌人的侧后攻击。他估计一连在正面攻击了三次，敌人的兵力一定集中在正面。他看到侧后的工事薄弱，虽然是一片开阔地，只要采取偷袭战术，是可以成功的。
    下两点，刘梅村带着一排，悄悄的爬上开阔地。天空上的照明弹一会亮一会灭，战士们爬一会歇一会。爬到两棵树后面，他指挥岳全忠去炸大门，命令三班插入交通沟，防止敌人从沟里逃进城。
    岳全忠抱着炸药包走了。很快的，前面一道电光，一声霹雳！刘梅村带着队伍，一阵风似的冲进两间大房，迅速攻下当中的大母堡。
    敌人慌乱的向外逃窜！一群敌人跑到交通沟里，被三班堵住缴了枪。七十多个地堡群全部占领。刘梅村看了一下表，正好过了十五分钟。清查一下人数，只有两个轻彩号。
    拂晓前，刘梅村在电话机里，听见团部通令表扬，给一连集体记一大功，他面上露出了胜利的微笑。
    二
    第二天清早，飞机在低空轮番轰炸，炸弹的爆裂和炮弹的响声，没有一分钟停止。原来的突破口没有扩大，大部队仍然挤在城边。纵队首长决心开辟新的突破口，强攻任务落在英雄连队的肩上。
    攻击点选在昨夜占领的地堡群通城的地方。城墙一丈五尺高，城头城下都有地堡。八尺深宽的外壕里，构筑着暗堡和梅花桩，壕外围着铁丝网。
    刘梅村不断考虑如何完成这艰巨的任务：“敌人三层火网，白天强攻没有重火器掩护，一定要很好的组织部队。”
    下午三点钟，刘梅村摇动指挥旗，轻重机枪暴风雨般扫上城头，六○炮弹在地堡上冒烟。敌人三架飞机在低空盘旋，炸弹像下雨，城里的迫击炮弹和六○炮弹，冰雹般的落在城外。整个西南角弥漫了浓烟，火药呛的鼻子难受，第二梯队望不见第一梯队。
    第一个爆炸手顺着壕沟穿过火海，突进铁丝网，炸掉城壕的外沟。第二个爆炸手乘着烟雾，炸毁外壕的里沟。第三个爆炸手，将城下的地堡炸毁！
    刘梅村向突击班挥动红旗，七班的战士们像飞箭似的穿过交通沟。刘梅村随在七班后面，炮弹在身边爆炸，子弹在头上呼啸，刘梅村挥着红旗，后续部队接着冲上来。
    七班冲到城下，把刺刀插在土墙上，一个个攀登上去。刘梅村把红旗插在城下，接着上去。敌人慌乱的后退了，刘梅村指挥部队向西猛扑，接连攻下十七个城头碉堡，俘虏了七十多个敌人。
    三
    黄昏时候，大雨不停的下，刘梅村又接到新的战斗任务：攻击气象台！三排留在城墙上和敌人对峙。刘梅村把一二排打剩下的人，编成一个排，准备天黑攻击！
    气象台四层高楼，周围一百多个地堡群，是敌人强有力的火力点，它阻碍了城里部队的前进，也妨碍了城外另一个兄弟纵队的攻城。刘梅村的攻击点选在气象台东南角一个小青楼。
    炸药全湿了，爆炸手王相亭拿着一把钳子，摸着黑路，爬到铁丝网下，剪了一个门，敌人还没有发觉。当他爬回来的时候，遇到了一个爆炸手，抱着团部才发下一包炸药，要去炸小青楼外面的地堡。王相亭告诉他剪开的地方，随即猛跑下来。
    王相亭刚回来，听见前面轰的一声！他急忙抱着第二包炸药，冲过炸开的地堡和短墙，按在小青楼下拉了火！小青楼炸了一个大洞，刘梅村带领队伍冲进去，敌人大部分逃跑了，只捉到几个人。
    刘梅村决定乘热打铁，亲自去侦察完气象台的地形，决定使用他的拿手好戏——偷袭！他带着四班，不管两旁地堡的敌人，悄悄地摸进刚才他侦察时剪开的铁丝网，迅速占领气象台外面的两间大房子。才回头过来肃清了来路两旁的地堡群。
    后续部队上来了。刘梅村命令王相亭去下炸药。王相亭冒着敌人的手榴弹，穿到楼下，按下炸药拉了弦。
    “轰”！突击班冲上去。在楼下转了一个大圈，找不到缺口，被楼上扔下成排的炸弹，伤亡了一大半，其余的急忙退回来。
    “糟糕！十斤炸药太少了，炸不动洋灰墙！”刘梅村想：“天快亮了，如果今夜不拿下，天一明敌人就会出击，这两间房子顶不住几个六○炮弹！”
    营部的通讯员传来命令，叫他们固守到明天晚上再攻击，刘梅村叫他报告营首长，决心天明以前拿下，要求营部给一包炸药和一些机枪子弹。
    一包廿斤的炸药和七十发子弹送来了。刘梅村叫王相亭选砖墙的地方炸。王相亭在机枪掩护下，重新冲进去！不一会，一声天崩地裂！刘梅村带着部队，钻进楼下，俘虏了一百卅多个敌人。
    四
    第四天下午，焦急等待着的任务下来了！团首长要刘梅村坚决拿下前面的大红楼。
    刘梅村知道大红楼是道西最后一个大据点，不肃清，就不能向道东进攻，他还知道红楼的工事很坚固，里面有不少敌人。却不知道这是敌人七十一军军部，里面住着七十一军的特务团。
    攻击开始了，爆炸手冒着敌人暴风雨般的炮火，进行了三次连续爆破，铁丝网和地堡摧毁了！红楼炸了一个大洞。王相亭带着突击班冲到楼下，刺死一个堵在缺口的敌人。刘梅村拾起敌人的冲锋枪，“突突”一阵子，把后面的敌人打跑了！
    刘梅村带着一班人冲进去，敌人机枪疯狂扫过来，战士们爬在走廊上，寸步不能前进。敌人反冲锋一次接着一次，像海潮一样，退了又来。手榴弹像飞蝗落在周围爆炸。战士们的脸，被火药熏的焦黑，一个班大部伤亡了，增援进来的一个班，也倒下好几个。
    “同志们，我们只能前进一尺，决不能后退一寸呀！”刘梅村张着嗓子喊着，他投了七八十个手榴弹，打热了四支步枪。腰部中了一粒子弹。但他一声不响继续的在指挥部队。
    正在紧急关头，连络道路被敌人火力切断了。手榴弹运不上来。敌人进行了十几次的反冲锋全被打垮！弹药快打光了！战士们活着能打枪的，只剩下七、八个人。
    “必须另外开辟道路！”刘梅村下了决心以后，立刻喊两个通讯员回去。通讯员冒着生死，抗来两包炸药。
    黎玉全抱着炸药，炸倒了一垛墙。他的脚被一支铁钉子戳透，他拔出铁钉，又去炸第二垛墙。
    炸药响了，木墙着了火，汽油库烧着了。楼上飞来一阵手榴弹，在刘梅村身边炸开，身上中了几十块碎片，他失掉了知觉。
    天黑了。红楼冒着熊熊的烈火。能爬动的战士，挣扎的爬出来。副排长刘振英忍着伤疼，使劲将刘梅村拖出去。楼上三千多敌人，被烧的往下跑，连特务团团长陈明信在一起，全部当了俘虏。
    刘梅村和他的英雄连队，在五天的攻坚战中，连续完成了五次战斗任务。对整个战役，起了重大作用。他们打垮一个团两个营和两个连的敌人，俘虏四百多人。全连一百三十四个同志，在血战中，伤亡了一百三十三个。全连出现了八十多个人民功臣。而他，却成了四平攻坚战中，一面勇敢战斗的旗帜，成为全军有名的战斗英雄。（附图片）
