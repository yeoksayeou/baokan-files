　　Japanese Peace Movement Flourishing
    National Signature Drive Exceeds Five Million
    French Provinces Prepare to Convene Peace Conferences

    [Xinhua News Agency, September 9th] According to a report by the Denstu Agency on the 7th: The Stockholm Peace Appeal signature campaign continues to flourish in Japan, with the number of signatures exceeding five million. Organized workers have been particularly active in this movement. For example, more than half of the 6,000 workers at the Nissan Motor factory in Yokohama signed the Peace Appeal several weeks ago, and the number of signatories is increasing daily. Many other encouraging reports continue to arrive. Representatives from over sixty temples recently gathered in Kyoto to organize the collection of peace signatures. To date, they have collected four thousand signatures. Hundreds of Buddhist monks are going door-to-door collecting signatures.
    The mayor of Kyoto, Yoshiro Takayama (transliteration), and the governor of Kyoto Prefecture, Torazo Ninagawa (both of whom were candidates elected by the Democratic National Front in the elections earlier this year), have signed the Peace Appeal. In the village of Toyooka in Kyoto Prefecture, all adults have signed the appeal, except for two young men. Because they refused to sign, their fiancées left them.
    In a hospital on the island of Kyushu, a social science study group of patients is collecting signatures from bed to bed. A crippled 19-year-old Korean girl in Seto, central Japan, collected 340 signatures in six days. As of mid-August, four thousand people in the city had signed the Peace Appeal.

    [Xinhua News Agency, September 9th] TASS, Paris, September 6th: French peace advocates are actively preparing for the Second World Peace Congress. Thirty-two provinces across the country have confirmed the dates for convening provincial peace conferences. Prior to this, mass rallies will be held to discuss the appeals from the Standing Committee Executive Bureau of the World Peace Congress in Prague, and to elect representatives to attend the provincial peace conferences.
    During the preparations for the Second World Peace Congress, a nationwide signature campaign for the Peace Appeal has been widely launched. It is reported that the total number of signatures recently collected in the Var department has reached 71 percent of the total population. Seven hundred thousand people have signed in the Nord department. The Association of Fighters for Peace and Freedom in the department has issued a letter to peace supporters, calling for intensified preparations for the provincial peace conference, and has set September 17th as the date for collective signing of the Peace Appeal.
