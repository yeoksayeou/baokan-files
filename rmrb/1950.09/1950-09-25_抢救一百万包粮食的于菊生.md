　　Yu Jusheng Rescues One Million Bags of Grain
    Yuan Shuipai

    To supply the needs of a city of six million people and control fluctuating grain prices, Shanghai concentrated 700 million jin of rice last summer. From Anhui, Hunan, Sichuan, the Northeast...almost from all the rice-producing areas of the country, trains carrying grain sped day and night to the vortex of volatile prices. This was a powerful force in the struggle against the price disasters left by the reactionaries. Millions of bags of rice were in the hands of the People's Government, like a rein on a wild horse. With the cooperation of other important factors, this struggle was won. In this struggle, the contributions of Yu Jusheng, a model of grain protection, were enormous.
    The rice arrived and was piled up in warehouses like mountains. But a serious problem arose.
    The 700,000 bags of Sichuan grain were heavily infested with insects. When people entered the warehouse, they could hear the rustling sound of insects eating rice. Coupled with the hot and humid weather in the south in July, this batch of grain quickly heated up and deteriorated. The China Grain Company and the heads of the warehouses were very anxious. Yu Jusheng, the head of the company's technical team, had previously invented the use of "666" insecticide powder to eliminate rice weevils in more than 56,000 bags of rice, rescuing state property worth more than 15 billion yuan. But now the insect infestation in these 700,000 bags of rice was even more serious than before, and spraying "666" powder could no longer stop the massive breeding of rice weevils. At this time, Yu Jusheng, an agronomist who had been studying grain storage methods for many years, created a method of fumigating with poisonous gas to kill insects. The poisonous gases were hydrocyanic acid and chloropicrin (tear gas), both of which are very toxic. Yu Jusheng suggested that the company adopt his method, but the company leaders could not decide for a while.
    "At that time," Yu Jusheng told the reporter, "every time I walked into the warehouse and heard the sound of insects eating rice, I felt indescribably uncomfortable. Seeing that these 700,000 bags of rice were about to suffer great losses, what could I do? ...You may not have seen it, but these insects can completely hollow out a grain of rice, leaving only the outer skin. Not to mention how much the loss would be if this batch of grain spoiled, just thinking that every grain of rice is the result of the peasants' blood and sweat, I was determined to rescue this rice that had already fallen into the mouths of insects."
    He knew that rice fumigated with poisonous gas would not affect its edibility. But not everyone could have such scientific knowledge. He had to fight against unscientific ideas. He did experiments for everyone to see, feeding white mice with rice fumigated with poisonous gas; then he asked experts to test the rice samples; and finally, he himself was the first to eat rice made from this fumigated rice. All kinds of experiments proved that the quality of the rice was as usual, and finally he gained the trust of the leaders and the masses.
    In the sweltering heat, "Old Yu" - as the comrades of the China Grain Company affectionately called this tireless, hard-working expert - led his colleagues in wearing gas masks and protective clothing to work in the warehouses with the most severe insect infestations as soon as day broke. They blocked and sealed all the holes, doors, and windows in the warehouse. The chemicals and sulfuric acid reacted chemically, emitting high heat. They shouldered sprayers, carried buckets of liquid medicine, and climbed up and down the mountain-like piles of rice bags. Sweat poured down in the airtight gas masks and protective clothing. Ordinary people feel difficulty breathing even in well-ventilated places when wearing protective clothing, let alone in the steaming poisonous fumes, heat, and confined warehouses. Once, Old Yu burned his foot with the chemical liquid, but he continued to work, enduring the pain. He has always had stomach problems and is relatively weak, but he still selflessly experimented, researched, and worked. Once, because of the urgency of the work, he struggled up from his sickbed and rushed to the warehouse with his tools before he had recovered.
    Once, Yu Jusheng and other comrades returned from working in the Pudong warehouse, and he suddenly fainted after getting on the ferry. After everyone rescued him, he was still planning the next day's work, assigning which comrade would go to which warehouse to work.
    In this way, the technical team, under the leadership of Yu Jusheng, rescued more than one million bags of rice.
    But this meritorious servant of the people modestly told the reporter that this little achievement was the result of the hard work and cooperation of his colleagues. He said that he was greatly influenced by the working spirit of the young students. He said that he was forty-four years old this year and had worked in reactionary government agencies for thirteen years. His creative ability and scientific technology had never been valued, and he had never had the opportunity to develop them. "The Kuomintang either kept technicians to eat and do nothing, setting up some kind of research institute, treating you as a decoration, or assigning you a position that had nothing to do with your specialty, so that what you learned was not used. They didn't need you to really do something beneficial to the country." Speaking of this, his usually humble and gentle tone became impassioned: "Because if you really did something for the people, it would be an obstacle to these bureaucrats!"
    Our topic turned to the past. Yu Jusheng said:
    "During the Anti-Japanese War, didn't we often eat bad rice in Chongqing? Either moldy or rotten. No one cared about the rice rotting in the warehouse, and even if they did, it would be worse. There were all kinds of ways to write off the rotten rice, and you could even embezzle and engage in corruption in the write-off. The saying was, 'It's better to be an official than to manage grain, and better to manage grain than to be a prostitute in the warehouse.' Managing the granary was a lucrative position. It was a complete mess!" Old Yu said excitedly: "After liberation, although I was a retained employee, I knew that what was overthrown was the reactionary system and the bureaucratic rule, not us honest workers. Therefore, I worked with peace of mind. I felt very happy to work under the leadership of the People's Government and the Communist Party! I saw the hardworking and faithful style of the Party members and the leadership's emphasis on scientific and technical personnel. They didn't hesitate to spend money to promote various research projects. I felt that now was really the time for us technicians to contribute our wisdom and ability to the country and the people... For decades, I have been groping alone, and now I finally see a bright road."
    Yu Jusheng has also made other important contributions in grain storage, such as the creation of "rational stacking" of rice bags, which increases the area of rice bags exposed to air, preventing the rice from heating up. This stacking method has been adopted by the China Grain Company's warehouses and promoted throughout the country. His creative method is to absorb and improve on existing folk experience methods. He also encourages the masses to continue to create other better methods. He said that it is not enough to rely on one person to do it.
    He also invented a new "right-angle rice thermometer" for measuring rice temperature. This instrument has become one of the important tools for managing granaries. When the weather is hot, the staff measure the rice temperature from morning to night, from one end of the warehouse to the other, without stopping for a moment, and report it to Yu Jusheng's technical team.
    "They compare this thermometer to a rifle, an indispensable weapon for soldiers in battle," Yu Jusheng said. "In the hot season, our team's work is very intense, answering calls from various warehouses at any time, understanding the situation, and directing the work. Our team seems to have become a command headquarters."
    And the commander in this headquarters is this man who is not tall, has stomach problems, and speaks gently and modestly. But he has a scientific mind, the will to overcome difficulties, and the spirit of serving the people.

　　抢救一百万包粮食的于菊生
    袁水拍
    为了供应一个六百万人口都市的需要，控制波动的粮价，上海市在去年夏季曾经集中过七亿斤大米。从安徽、湖南、四川、东北……几乎是从全国的产米区，列车载运粮食日夜奔赴这物价波动的涡心。这是和反动派遗留下来的物价的灾害作斗争的一支有力部队。千百万包大米被掌握在人民政府手里，像驾御一匹劣马有了缰绳一样。由于其他重要的因素的配合，这场斗争是胜利了。在这次斗争中，保护粮食的模范于菊生的功绩是巨大的。
    大米是运到了，一座座山似地堆装在仓库里。但发生了一个严重问题。
    这七十万包川粮的虫害闹得很凶。人们一走进仓库，就听到一片虫子吃米的沙沙声。加上南方七月的闷热天气，这批粮食很快地在发热，变质。中国粮食公司和各库负责人都很焦急。公司技术小组负责人于菊生曾经发明采用“六六六”杀虫粉，消灭过五万六千多包米里的米象虫，抢救了价值一百五十余亿元的国家财产。但现在这七十万包大米的虫害，比以前更严重，喷洒“六六六”粉已经阻止不住大量米象虫的繁殖。这时候，这位研究储藏粮食方法已经多年的农学家于菊生创造了用毒气熏蒸杀虫的方法。那种毒气是氰酸气和氯化苦（催泪气），都很毒。于菊生建议公司采用他的方法，公司负责人一时还决定不下。
    “那时候，”于菊生向记者说：“我每天走进仓库，一听到一片虫子吃米的声音，心里就说不出的难受。眼看这七十万包米要遭受极大的损失，怎么办？……你也许没有看见过，这种虫子能够把一颗米完全蛀空，只剩外皮。不要说，这批粮食如果坏了损失将多大，只要想到每一颗米都是农民的血汗收获，我就下决心要把这批已经落入虫嘴的大米抢救出来。”
    他知道熏过毒气的米并不会影响食用。可是这样的科学知识不可能大家都具备。他必需和非科学的思想作斗争。他做实验给大家看，用熏过毒气的米喂白鼠；再请专家化验米样；最后他自己第一个人先吃这种熏过毒气的米所做成的饭。种种试验都证明米质如常，这样终于取得了领导和群众的信任。
    在酷热的天气里，“于老头”——中粮公司同志这样亲切地称呼这位不知疲倦的埋头苦干的专家——每天天一亮，就带领工作同志穿戴起防毒面具和衣服，跑到虫害最烈的仓库里去工作。他们堵塞和关严了仓内所有的孔洞和门窗。药品和硫酸起着化学作用，发出高热。他们掮起喷器，提着药水桶，在山峰似的米包堆上爬上爬下。汗水在密不通气的防毒面具和衣服里直淋。一般人穿起防毒服装，即使在空气流通的地方也感觉呼吸困难，不要说处在蒸腾着毒气的烟雾，酷热和密闭的仓房里了。有一次于老头被药水灼伤了脚，他忍着痛继续干。他一向有胃病，身体比较弱，但还是忘我地实验着，研究着，工作着。曾经为了工作的迫不及待，他从病床上挣扎起来，不等病体恢复就拿起工具直奔仓库里去。
    有一次于菊生和别的同志们从浦东仓库工作回来，他上了渡船以后竟突然晕倒了。等大家救醒他以后，他还是计划着明天的工作，分配那一个同志到那一个仓库去工作。
    就是这样，技术小组在于菊生的领导下前后抢救了一百多万包大米。
    但这位人民的功臣很谦逊地对记者说，能有这一点成绩，是工作同志们辛勤合作的结果。他表示自己受青年学生们的工作精神的影响很大。他说，他今年四十四岁，曾在反动政府机关里做过十三年事。他的创造能力和科学技术从来没有被重视，也从来没有机会发展。“国民党不是把技术人员养起来白吃饭，设立一个什么研究所，把你当装饰品，便是分派你一个和你的专业毫不相干的职务，所学非所用。他们是不需要你真正地做一些对国家有利的工作的。”说到这里，他的一向谦抑平和的语调变得激昂起来了：“因为如果你真正替老百姓做了事，反而对这些官僚们有妨碍！”
    我们的话题转到了过去。于菊生说：
    “在抗战期间我们在重庆不是经常吃坏米吗？不是霉，便是烂。仓里米腐烂了也没有人管，甚至管了反而不好。米烂掉自有种种办法报销，在报销中反而可以贪污舞弊。所谓‘做官不如从良（粮），从良不如当娼（仓）’。管粮仓是个肥缺。真是黑漆一团！”老于激动地说：“解放以后，我虽然是留用人员，但是我知道推翻的是反动制度、官僚统治，不是我们老老实实的工作人员，因此我安心办事，我感到在人民政府和共产党的领导下工作，非常痛快！我看到了党员们的勤劳忠实的作风和领导上对科学技术人员的重视。不惜经费，推进各项研究工作。我感到现在真是我们技术人员贡献自己的智慧能力给国家、人民的时候了……几十年来，我是一个人摸索，现在才看见了一条光明大道。”
    于菊生在储藏粮食方面还有其他重要贡献，像米袋“合理堆桩”的创造，使米袋接触空气的面积增加，防止米粮发热。这种堆桩法已被中粮公司各库采用，并推广到全国去。他的创造方法是吸收民间原有的经验方法，加以改进。他更鼓励群众继续创造其他更好的方法。他说光靠一个人做是不济事的。
    他还发明了新式的测量米温用的“直角式米温计”。这仪器已经成为管理米仓工作重要工具之一。当气候炎热的时候，工作人员从早到晚，从仓库的一头到那一头，一刻也不停地测量着米温，报告到于菊生的技术小组去。
    “他们把这温度计比做士兵作战不可缺少的一枝枪。”于菊生说：“在炎热的季节里，我们小组的工作很紧张，随时接听各库的电话，了解情况，指挥工作。我们的小组好像变成了一个司令部。”
    而这司令部里的司令员就是这身材不大，有着胃病，说话温和而谦逊的人。可是他有科学的头脑，克服困难的意志，和愿为人民服务的精神。
