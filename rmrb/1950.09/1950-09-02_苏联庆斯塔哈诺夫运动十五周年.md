Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: The Soviet people enthusiastically celebrated the 15th anniversary of the Stakhanovite movement on August 31st, according to a comprehensive TASS report.

            Kuznetsov Writes in Pravda
    Kuznetsov, Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, wrote in Pravda that Comrade Stalin believed that the Stakhanovite movement was a great force in striving for the victory of communism from the very beginning. It has actually caused a revolution in Soviet industry and created broad conditions for the continuous increase of production.

    Kuznetsov discussed the development of the Stakhanovite movement after the war, stating: After the end of World War II, the socialist competition has become a nationwide movement. More than 90% of the workers in the Soviet Union have participated in this competition. The forms of competition are varied, including competition between workers, engineers, and designers, as well as competition between work teams, workshops, and factories. This collectivity of competition is one of the most significant features of the post-war competition.

    Another characteristic of the post-war competition is the close connection between scientific institutions and industrial enterprises. This connection not only enriches labor through science but also improves science through the experience of advanced workers.

    Kuznetsov then pointed out that the labor productivity of the Soviet Union is constantly increasing. Industrial labor productivity in 1948 increased by 15% compared to 1947, exceeding the pre-war level. In 1949, labor productivity increased by another 13%. In the first quarter of this year, labor productivity increased by 13% compared to the same period last year, and in the second quarter, it increased by 12%. The superiority of the socialist system is even more evident from the contrast between the increase in Soviet labor productivity and the increasing decline in labor productivity in capitalist countries.

    Kuznetsov emphasized that the nationwide competition carried out by the Soviet working people provides an encouraging example for the People's Democratic countries of Southeast Europe. The workers of the New China, who are launching a labor competition, are also absorbing the experience of Soviet socialist construction.

            Osipov Issues Statement
    Osipov, one of the secretaries of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, issued a statement on the 30th, stating that the Stakhanovite movement is a great driving force for the Soviet Union's development from socialism to communism. In the post-war period, thanks to the adoption of accelerated work methods, millions of Stakhanovite workers, tens of thousands of Stakhanovite work teams, and a large number of Stakhanovite factories have emerged in Soviet enterprises. One of the characteristics of the Stakhanovite movement is that the working people strive to overfulfill production plans and improve product quality at the same time. Production costs in various sectors of the Soviet national economy have been greatly reduced due to the saving of raw materials, fuel, and electricity, and the better use of production equipment.

    Osipov emphasized that in the Soviet Union, Stakhanovite workers and innovators of production methods are highly respected. They are awarded Stalin Prizes along with outstanding representatives of science, technology, and culture and art. They have eliminated the difference between manual and mental labor.

### 苏联庆斯塔哈诺夫运动十五周年

　　苏联庆斯塔哈诺夫运动十五周年
    【新华社一日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联人民于八月三十一日热烈庆祝斯塔哈诺夫运动十五周年。
            库兹涅佐夫在真理报撰文
    全苏工会中央理事会主席库兹涅佐夫在真理报上撰文称：早在斯塔哈诺夫运动开始之时，斯大林同志就认为这个运动是争取共产主义胜利的巨大力量。它实际上已引起了苏联工业的革命，并为生产的不断增加创造了广泛的条件。
    库兹涅佐夫论述斯塔哈诺夫运动在战后的发展称：第二次世界大战结束后，社会主义竞赛已成为全国规模的运动。全苏联已有百分之九十以上的工人参加了这个竞赛，竞赛的方式是多种多样的，有工人、工程师、设计家之间的竞赛，也有工作组、工作间和工厂之间的竞赛，这种竞赛的集体性，便是战后竞赛的显著特色之一。
    战后竞赛的另一特色，就是科学机关与工业企业之间的密切联系。这种联系不仅使劳动因科学而更加丰富，而且也使科学因得到先进工人的经验而日益完善。
    库兹涅佐夫接着指出苏联劳动生产率在不断地增加。一九四八年的工业劳动生产率较一九四七年增加了百分之十五，超过了战前的水平。一九四九年劳动生产率又提高了百分之十三。今年第一季的劳动生产率较去年同期增加了百分之十三，第二季则增加了百分之十二。社会主义制度的优越性，从苏联劳动生产率的增加与资本主义国家劳动生产率的日益下降相对比中，益是更加显明了。
    库兹涅佐夫强调指出：苏联劳动人民所进行的全国规模的竞赛，给东南欧各人民民主国家提供了令人鼓舞的范例。正在开展着劳动竞赛的新中国工人，也在吸收着苏联社会主义建设的经验。
            奥希波夫发表谈话
    全苏工会中央理事会书记之一奥希波夫，于三十日发表谈话称：斯塔哈诺夫运动是苏联从社会主义向共产主义发展的巨大推动力。在战后时期，由于采用了加速度的工作方法，苏联各企业已涌现了成百万的斯塔哈诺夫工作者，成万的斯塔哈诺夫工作班，和大批的斯塔哈诺夫工厂。斯塔哈诺夫运动的特点之一，便是劳动人民力求超额完成生产计划，并同时改进产品质量。苏联国民经济各部门由于节省原料、燃料与电力，及以更好的方法利用生产设备，生产成本已大为减低。
    奥希波夫强调称：在苏联，斯塔哈诺夫工作者及生产方法革新者，是非常受人尊敬的。他们和科学、技术与文化艺术界的卓越代表一同荣获斯大林奖金。他们已经消除了体力劳动与脑力劳动之间的差别。
