　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd: The Southwest Military and Political Committee's Department of Transportation convened the first regional transportation work conference from August 21st to September 2nd. The conference decided that all regions in the area should continue to repair and appropriately improve provincial highways; and that transportation departments and representatives of public and private commercial vehicles should jointly organize a highway transportation committee to be responsible for adjusting public-private relations, negotiating transportation methods, and improving business. The conference believes that, based on the characteristics of inconvenient land transportation in the Southwest, fully utilizing inland waterway wooden boat transportation is very important. Currently, in Sichuan alone, the rivers navigable by wooden boats exceed 10,000 kilometers, with more than 18,000 wooden boats of four tons or more, with a total tonnage exceeding four times the current Yangtze River steamer transportation volume. This is a considerable transportation force and should be strengthened in terms of organization and management to fully utilize its role.

　　西南第一届交通会议决定
    充分利用内河航运
    继续整修公路调整公私运输关系
    【新华社重庆二十二日电】西南军政委员会交通部于八月二十一日至九月二日召开全区第一届交通工作会议。会议决定全区各地应继续整修和适当改善省道公路；并由各地交通部门及公私商车代表联合组织公路运输委员会，负责调整公私关系，协商运输办法，改进业务。会议认为：根据西南陆上交通不便的特点，充分利用内河木船运输是非常重要的。现四川一地行驶木船的河流在一万公里以上，有四吨以上木船一万八千余只，总吨位超过目前川江轮船运输量四倍。这是一个相当大的运输力量，应加强组织管理，以充分发挥其作用。
