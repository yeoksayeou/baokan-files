　　Mao Zedong Locomotive
    (Serialized novella)
    By Ding Kexin, Qingying, Illustration by Zhuang Yan
    Thirty-four, "You came voluntarily, it's wonderful!"
    It turned out that the old hero, after returning from yesterday's temporary ride (Note 1), learned from the operations director that the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was about to enter the customs (pass through the Guanshan mountain range into Northeast China); the operations director also said:
    "Maybe they'll ask you to go."
    The old hero immediately knew what was up: Representative Zhang was definitely going to ask him to go. So he said to the operations director:
    "I'm going home today, not staying at the locomotive depot."
    After the successive liberation of Jinzhou, Changchun, and Shenyang, the comrades clamored to enter the customs, and even made bets with each other to see who would go and who wouldn't. At that time, the old hero said:
    "Don't shout yet, don't chicken out when it's really time to enter the customs!"
    At that time, the old hero was prepared, and now that the opportunity had really come, how could he miss it? He decided to request to enter the customs, but he was always careful and considerate in his work. He thought this matter had to be discussed with his family first, so he went home that night.
    Unexpectedly, none of his family members had any objections, which made the old hero extremely happy. His old father said that since the Communist Party came, workers didn't have to worry about food and clothing. They didn't have enough to eat before, but now they eat their fill. They didn't have a place to live before, but now they have houses to live in. If they have difficulties, they will be given relief. What's there to worry about? His wife also said that his wages would still be paid here when he entered the customs, and she could also spin thread at home, so they wouldn't starve. He didn't need to worry about things at home. His little daughter, Yunxiang, was even happier, hugging his neck and saying that this time her father was entering the customs, his name as a hero would be even bigger, and all of China would know about it.
    But after going to bed, he thought of a problem: "What if everyone doesn't welcome him on the train? He's already a person who left the train!" Thinking like this, he tossed and turned, unable to sleep for a long time. ...
    Early the next morning, he went to the depot with a worried heart to find Guo Shude and the others. It just so happened that they were having a meeting. Someone saw him from afar and shouted loudly:
    "Old hero, are you getting on the train or not?"
    The old hero quickly took a few steps and said with a smile:
    "If everyone wants me to, I'll get on the train."
    People burst into enthusiastic applause, expressing a warm welcome. Only then did the stone in his heart fall to the ground with a plop.
    Guo Shude immediately said:
    "Old hero, everyone welcomes you, you came voluntarily, it's wonderful! Tell me, how much settlement allowance do you need? I'll lend it to you. I have fewer family members than you, it doesn't matter."
    The old hero immediately grasped Guo Shude's hands, squeezing out tears and said:
    "Chief Guo, I don't have any difficulties, I can't let you worry anymore!"
    Guo Shude said:
    "We are the working class, led by the Communist Party and Chairman Mao. We should help each other when anyone has difficulties. If I have difficulties, I still need your help."
    Others also said:
    "This time we enter the customs, everyone must unite and help each other even more, and we must take special care of the old hero."
    This made the old hero so moved that he didn't know what to say.
    Note 1: Guiding drivers and others who follow the train are called temporary riders. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号
    （中篇连载）

    三十四、“你自动来了，太美啦！”
    原来老英雄昨天添乘（注一）回来，就从运转主任那里得到了“毛泽东号”要进关的消息；运转主任还说：
    “说不定还会叫你去呢。”
    老英雄当下心里就有了底：张代表准要叫他去的。于是就对运转主任说：
    “今儿回家呀，不在机务段住了。”
    锦州、长春、沈阳相继解放之后，伙伴们就嚷进关，而且互相打赌，看谁去谁不去。当时老英雄就说：
    “先不要嚷，等到真要进关不要又拉稀！”
    那时候老英雄原是有准备的，现在机会真的来了，还能错过？决定请求进关，不过他做事素来仔细，考虑周到，他想这事先得跟家里人商量好，因此当天晚上他就回家了。
    不料家里人都没有意见，真叫老英雄欢喜不尽。老父亲说共产党来了工人不愁吃穿，以前没吃的，现在吃饱了，以前没住处，现在有房子住了，有困难还要救济，还有什么不放心的？老伴也说，他进关工资还在这里开，家里又纺线，饿不着，家里的事不用他管。小女儿云香更高兴，抱住他的脖子，说这回爸爸进关，英雄的名儿就更大了，全中国都会知道。
    可是睡下以后，他想起了一个问题：“大家要是不欢迎他上车怎么办？他是已经离开车的人了！”这样一想，翻来覆去，好久睡不着。……
    第二天一早，他怀着忐忐忑忑的心到段上找到郭树德他们。恰好他们正在开会，有人老远一见他，就大声喊：
    “老英雄上车不上车？”
    老英雄赶紧走上几步笑着说：
    “大家要我，我就上车。”
    人们一阵子呱哒呱哒大鼓掌，表示热烈的欢迎，这时他心里的石头才噗通落了地。
    郭树德马上说道：
    “老英雄，大家都欢迎你，你自动来了，太美啦！说吧，你需要多少安家费？我借给你。我人口比你少，没关系。”
    老英雄一下子就握住了郭树德的双手，挤着泪花说道：
    “郭大车，我没有什么困难，可不能再让你费心了！”
    郭树德道：
    “咱们工人阶级，共产党毛主席领导咱们，谁有困难应当互相帮助，我有了困难，还要你多帮助哩。”
    别人也都说：
    “咱们这次进关，大家更要团结互助，对老英雄要特别照顾。”
    这叫老英雄感动得不知说什么好。
    注一：指导司机等跟着跑车叫添乘。（附图片）
