　　U.S. Military Aggression Against Taiwan
　　On the 24th, Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government, sent a telegram to Malik, President of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Trygve Lie, accusing the United States of direct armed aggression against Taiwan Province, a territory of our country, and suggested that the Security Council immediately take measures to make the U.S. government completely withdraw its armed aggressive forces from Taiwan and other territories belonging to China. Minister Zhou's solemn and just accusation and suggestion made the American aggressors embarrassed and tried to cover up the facts of aggression with absurd and naive lies. According to the U.S. official news agency, the U.S. News Service, Washington, August 25th: "U.S. Department of Defense officials solemnly stated that there are no U.S. military personnel in Taiwan, not even a military mission. The Air Force Department declared that there are no U.S. aircraft stationed in Taiwan. The Navy Department said that naval aircraft and ships have not visited Taiwan recently." However, these futile lies of the American aggressors can absolutely not cover up their real and tangible acts of aggression against Taiwan.
　　As early as after Japan's surrender, the U.S. military, under the pretext of "repatriating prisoners," conducted various investigation activities in Taiwan in preparation for further aggression. After U.S. President's Special Envoy Wedemeyer arrived in Taiwan in August 1947, the U.S. aggression activities actively unfolded. Americans successively established U.S. air force bases and liaison radio stations and other equipment at Songshan Airport in Taipei, Taichung Airport, Tainan Airport, and Hsinchu Airport, and transferred some military aircraft from the Ryukyus to be stationed permanently at various airports in Taiwan. The U.S. 13th Air Force used the largest Hsinchu Airport as its base. On the naval front, the ports of Keelung and Kaohsiung have long become U.S. naval bases. In the spring of 1948, U.S. Western Pacific Fleet Commander Cooke led ships to "visit" Keelung and Kaohsiung. Since then, the fleet has continued to berth in the two ports. At its peak, the number of U.S. ships berthed in Kaohsiung Port reached 27. On the army front, as is well known, the U.S. so-called "Joint Military Advisory Group" has a large number of active-duty officers permanently stationed in Taiwan, responsible for training the Kuomintang remnant bandits' so-called "new army." In 1949, the Kuomintang remnant bandit gang fled from the mainland to Taiwan, and the U.S. "Joint Military Advisory Group" also fled to Taiwan with the head of the group, Barr, and stepped up various aggressive activities of the army, navy, and air force in the area.
　　Since June 27th this year, when U.S. President Truman issued a statement on the aggression against Taiwan and Korea, the U.S. military aggression against Taiwan has been intensified.
　　On July 6th, eight "communication experts" of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, ordered to invade Taiwan, flew from Manila to Taiwan to establish radio communication equipment. On the 8th, U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Struble arrived in Taiwan from Japan and held consultations with Chiang Kai-shek and other bandit leaders. On the 16th, MacArthur formally announced that the U.S. Seventh Fleet had begun "air and sea reconnaissance" in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. According to a report by the New York Herald Tribune reporter from Taipei on July 24th, the scope of the U.S. fleet's intrusion into our territorial waters for patrol activities extended from the sea off Shantou, Guangdong in the south to the waters off Qingdao Port, Shandong in the north, a coastline of 1,000 miles. On July 31st, MacArthur, the executor of the U.S. policy of aggression against Asia and the Far East and commander-in-chief of the U.S. Far East Command, flew from Japan to Taiwan. After consulting with Chiang Kai-shek, he left Taiwan for Japan on August 1st. When leaving Taiwan, MacArthur issued a statement saying: "Effective contact has been established between the U.S. military under my command and the troops of the Chinese government (referring to the Kuomintang bandit gang)." This indicates that the scale of U.S. armed aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan has been expanded. After MacArthur returned to Japan, the U.S. aggression activities against Taiwan were fully launched.
　　First, the United States sent a formal military mission to Taiwan. MacArthur publicly appointed his Deputy Chief of Staff, Major General Fox, to lead 22 officers and soldiers to Taiwan from Japan on August 4th and established the so-called "MacArthur Headquarters Military Liaison Group stationed in Taiwan." After Fox arrived in Taiwan, he consulted with Chiang Kai-shek and other bandit leaders and officially started working on the 8th at the Taiwan Defense Headquarters of the Kuomintang bandit gang's pseudo-government. According to a report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency on August 10th: "The name of the Military Liaison Group may soon be changed to a more practical name, because this organization will have the power to command the U.S. Navy and Air Force in Taiwan; that is to say, the Seventh Fleet and the 13th Air Force assisting in the defense of Taiwan will be controlled and commanded by the current Liaison Group." As expected, the "Military Liaison Group" was renamed the "U.S. Far East Command Inspection Group stationed in Taiwan" on August 16th. Since then, the organization and personnel of the military mission have been further expanded compared with before. According to a report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency, Taipei, August 17th: "The 'MacArthur Headquarters Liaison Group stationed in Taiwan' has been renamed the 'U.S. Far East Command Inspection Group stationed in Taiwan' since the 16th, and its business scope and work nature are the same as those of the former Liaison Group. The internal organization is divided into four groups, whose functions are personnel, intelligence, operations, and logistics. The total number of personnel is 50 officers and 75 soldiers below the rank of warrant officer." On August 22nd, MacArthur reassigned Concering, a senior official of the U.S. Far East Military Command, as the head of the group, and Concering arrived in Taiwan on the 23rd.
　　The above facts prove that the U.S. Department of Defense's claim that "there are no U.S. military personnel in Taiwan, not even a military mission" is an extremely rogue and foolish lie.
　　Secondly, at the same time as Fox arrived in Taiwan, on August 4th, the commander of the U.S. 13th Air Force, Major General Tunner, also arrived in Taiwan. The team's official aggression agency in Taiwan was officially established on August 7th in the Air Force Headquarters of the Taiwan Kuomintang pseudo-government. The Kuomintang Central News Agency formally reported the news. A dispatch from the agency in Taipei on August 7th stated: "The official agency of the U.S. 13th Air Force stationed in Taiwan was officially established this morning. ... Tunner went to work this morning to handle liaison and related joint operations between the Chinese (Kuomintang) and U.S. Air Forces." This report from the Central News Agency actually proves that the U.S. 13th Air Force's stationing agency in Taiwan is not only a "liaison" agency, but also an aggression and operations agency.
　　Before and after the establishment of the U.S. Air Force's "official agency" in Taiwan, several batches of U.S. jet aircraft flew to Taiwan, and several airports in Taiwan have been lengthened to allow U.S. jet aircraft and heavy bombers to take off and land.
　　The fact that the U.S. Air Force 13th Air Force has appeared in and invaded Taiwan is even considered by the commander of the air force, Major General Tunner, as "not needing to be completely kept secret." According to a dispatch from United Press International in Taipei on August 6th: "U.S. jet aircraft appeared over Taipei today, however, the commander of the 13th Air Force, Major General Tunner, stated that the number and activities of jet aircraft squadrons in the future are within the scope of military confidentiality. Tunner told United Press International reporters that it is not necessary to completely keep secret the stationing of jet aircraft in Taiwan. However, at the same time, the details of the activities of U.S. aircraft and the work of the liaison group established under MacArthur's instructions will not be disclosed." According to a broadcast by the Kuomintang Taiwan Radio on August 6th: "Six U.S. jet aircraft flew to Taiwan on August 4th. Taiwan will expand several airports for the use of the U.S. Air Force; however, the number of airports being expanded is still a secret. One of the many tasks is to lengthen the runways for jet aircraft and heavy bombers to take off and land. On August 6th, another six jet aircraft passed over Taipei." The U.S. planes that arrived in Taiwan were immediately used to monitor and blockade mainland China. According to a broadcast by Kuomintang Taiwan Radio on August 8th: "U.S. aircraft that have arrived in Taiwan have been dispatched from time to time with Kuomintang aircraft in the Taiwan Strait to 'patrol, search, and guard'." On August 18th, the Kuomintang Central News Agency, Taipei, reported again: "B-80 jet aircraft of the U.S. Far East Air Force 13th Air Force continue to arrive here from Manila in batches, and some flew over Taipei at 2 pm today." Due to the U.S. Air Force's intrusion into and stationing in Taiwan, the United States transported a large amount of aviation gasoline to Taiwan. According to a broadcast by the Kuomintang Taiwan Radio on August 6th: "The U.S. Navy oil tanker Cimarron arrived in Keelung fully loaded with gasoline today for the use of the air force defending Taiwan. The oil tanker was escorted by the Seventh Fleet cruiser Juneau and two destroyers. It is said that MacArthur said that this batch of gasoline is for both parties (referring to the U.S. and Chiang) needs."
　　With the U.S. aggressors' air force stationed in Taiwan, the U.S. Air Force's "Taiwan Forward Command Post" has also been established. According to a broadcast by Kuomintang Taiwan Radio on August 10th: "A batch of personnel from the U.S. 13th Air Force transferred to Taiwan took a military plane from a base in Manila and arrived at Songshan Airport at 14:00 on August 10th. It is reported that the batch of personnel will participate in the Forward Command Post service." The radio station also said on August 28th that the 13th Air Force's "stationing command post is working quite intensively and busily."
　　These facts mentioned above completely prove that the U.S. Air Force Department's statement that "there are no U.S. aircraft stationed in Taiwan" is an outrageous lie.
　　Again, the U.S. aggressors' navy sailed to the Taiwan Strait after Truman issued the aggression statement on June 27th. Since August, the fleet's ships have traveled between the two seaports of Keelung and Kaohsiung very frequently. According to the Kuomintang Central News Agency's dispatches, from August 5th to the present, as many as eleven U.S. cruisers, destroyers, and transport ships have arrived at the two ports. Just four days before the U.S. Navy Department announced that U.S. naval ships had "not visited Taiwan recently," on August 21st, the 25,000-ton cruiser Worcester arrived in Keelung; on the 22nd, Misamore, the commander of the Taiwan Strait Detachment of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, also arrived in Keelung aboard the cruiser Vaster. Two days after the U.S. Navy Department issued the above-mentioned shameless statement, on August 27th, Rear Admiral Plimpton, the official commander of the Taiwan Strait Detachment of the Seventh Fleet, arrived in Keelung aboard the cruiser St. Paul and went to Taipei for consultations with the Kuomintang remnant bandits.
　　Not only have a large number of U.S. naval vessels already invaded Taiwan's seaports, but the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet has already established a so-called "liaison department" in Taiwan. According to a dispatch from United Press International in Taipei on July 24th: "Lieutenant Commander Gabert of the Seventh Fleet arrived in Taipei today and began to establish a naval liaison department in Taiwan."
　　All of the above series of facts prove that the U.S. government is deliberately invading Taiwan Province, a territory of China, and that the U.S. Navy and Air Force have arbitrarily invaded China's territorial waters and airspace, and established military bases in Taiwan Province, a territory of China. The U.S. military missions have already begun activities in Taiwan. All of this has indisputably constituted the criminal act of U.S. armed aggression against China.

　　美国对台湾的军事侵略活动
    我中央人民政府周恩来外长于二十四日致电联合国安全理事会主席马立克和秘书长赖伊，控诉美国对我国领土台湾省的直接武装侵略，并建议安理会立即采取措施，使美国政府自台湾及其他属于中国的领土完全撤出它的武装侵略部队。周外长这一辞严义正的控诉和建议，使得美国侵略者狼狈不堪，力图以荒谬幼稚的谎言来掩饰侵略的事实。据美国官方通讯社美国新闻处华盛顿八月二十五日电称：“美国国防部官员们郑重声明，台湾并无美国军事人员，甚至没有军事使团。空军部宣称，并无美国飞机驻于台湾。海军部说，海军飞机及船舰最近并未访问台湾。”但是美国侵略者这些心劳日拙的谎言，是绝对掩盖不了他们真刀真枪地侵略台湾的行为的。
    早在日本投降以后，美国军队即以“遣俘”等为名，在台湾进行各种调查活动，准备作进一步的侵略。一九四七年八月间，美国总统特使魏德迈到台湾后，美国的侵略活动即积极展开。美国人先后在台北松山机场、台中机场、台南机场和新竹机场建立了美国空军基地及联络电台等设备，并从琉球抽调了一部分军用飞机常驻台湾各机场，美国第十三航空队则以最大的新竹机场作为基地。海军方面，基隆和高雄两港口早已成为美海军基地。一九四八年春，美国西太平洋舰队司令柯克曾率舰“访问”基隆和高雄，此后该舰队即继续不断地前往两港停泊。高雄港停泊的美舰，最多时曾达二十七艘。在陆军方面，如所周知，美国的所谓“联合军事顾问团”就有大批现役军官常驻台湾，负责训练国民党残匪的所谓“新军”。一九四九年，国民党残余匪帮从大陆逃往台湾，美国的“联合军事顾问团”亦由团长巴大维率领随逃台湾，并在该地加紧展开陆、海、空军的各种侵略活动。
    今年六月二十七日，美国总统杜鲁门发表侵略台湾、朝鲜的声明后，美国对台湾的军事侵略行动就更加加紧了。
    七月六日，受命侵略台湾的美第七舰队的“通讯专家”八人由马尼拉飞抵台湾，建立无线电联络的设备。八日，美第七舰队司令史枢波由日本抵达台湾，曾与蒋贼及其他匪首进行会商。十六日，麦克阿瑟正式宣布美第七舰队已开始在台湾海峡与南海进行“海空侦察”。据纽约先驱论坛报记者七月二十四日自台北报道，该美国舰队侵入我领海进行巡逻活动的范围，南起广东汕头的海面北至山东青岛港外，为一条长达一千英里的海岸线。七月三十一日，美国侵略亚洲及远东政策的执行人、美国远东军总司令麦克阿瑟由日本飞往台湾，在与蒋贼会商之后于八月一日离台返日。麦克阿瑟在离开台湾时发表声明称：“余统率下之美军与中国政府（按指国民党匪帮）军队间之有效联系业已形成。”这表明美国对中国领土台湾的武装侵略规模业已扩大。麦克阿瑟返日之后，美国对台湾的侵略活动即全面展开。
    首先，美国派遣了一个正式的军事使团到达台湾。麦克阿瑟公开任命其副参谋长福克斯少将率领官兵二十二名，于八月四日由日抵台，成立了所谓“麦克阿瑟总部驻台军事联络组”。福克斯抵达台湾后，曾与蒋贼及其他匪首会商，并于八日在台湾国民党匪帮伪政府的台湾防卫总部内正式开始办公。据国民党中央社八月十日电称：“军事联络组这一名称不久或将改为更切合实际一些的名称，因为这一组织将有权指挥美国在台的海军和空军；也就是说，协助防守台湾的第七舰队和第十三航空队都将由现在的联络组控制和指挥。”果然如此，该“军事联络组”于八月十六日即改名为“美国远东军驻台考察团”。自此以后，该军事使团的组织与人员编制便较前更加扩大。据国民党中央社台北八月十七日电称：“‘麦克阿瑟总部驻台联络组’十六日起已改名为‘美国远东军驻台考察团’，其业务范围及工作性质与前身的联络组相同。内部组织分为四组，其职掌分人事、情报、作战及补给。全部人员编制为官员五十人，准尉以下之士兵为七十五人。”八月二十二日，麦克阿瑟又改调美国远东军事统帅部高级官员康克灵任该团团长，康克灵于二十三日抵台。
    上述事实证明：美国国防部所谓“台湾并无美国军事人员，甚至没有军事使团”，乃是极端无赖而愚蠢的谎言。
    其次，与福克斯抵达台湾同时，即八月四日，美国第十三航空队司令滕纳少将亦抵达台湾。该队在台湾的正式侵略机构已于八月七日在台湾国民党伪政府空军总部中成立。国民党中央社曾正式报道了这个消息。该社八月七日台北电称：“美国第十三航空队驻在台湾的正式机构，今日上午已正式成立。……滕纳今晨前往办公，就近处理中（国民党）美空军间之联络及有关联合作战事宜。”中央社的这个报道实际上是证明了美国第十三航空队的驻台机构不仅是一个“联络”机构，而且是一个侵略和作战机构。
    美国空军在台湾的“正式机构”成立前后，已有数批美国喷气式飞机飞抵台湾，台湾的数处机场并已加长跑道，供美国的喷气式飞机及重轰炸机起落之用。
    美国空军第十三航空队在台湾出现并侵驻台湾的事实，甚至连该航空队司令滕纳少将本人也认为“不需要完全保守秘密”。据合众社台北八月六日电称：“美国的喷气飞机本日在台北上空出现，然而第十三航空队司令滕纳少将表示：将来喷气飞机中队的数量与活动是属于军事保密的范围的。滕纳告合众社记者说：不需要完全把喷气飞机驻在台湾一事保守秘密。但同时，美国飞机的活动和在麦克阿瑟指令下建立的联络团的工作详情，将不予透露。”另据国民党台湾电台八月六日广播称：“美喷气飞机六架已于八月四日飞抵台湾。台湾将扩大机场数处，供美空军使用；不过关于有多少机场在扩大现在还是一个机密。许多工作中的一种是加长跑道，以供喷气式飞机和重轰炸机起落之用。八月六日又有六架喷气式机经过台北上空。”到达台湾的美国机立刻用以监视和封锁中国大陆。据国民党台湾电台八月八日广播称：“已到达台湾的美国飞机已和国民党飞机一同不时出动台湾海峡，“担任巡逻、搜索、警戒”。到了八月十八日，国民党中央社台北电讯又报道：“美远东空军第十三航空队Ｂ——八十式喷气飞机继续有××架自马尼拉抵此间，一部并于本日下午二时飞临台北上空。”由于美国空军侵入并驻扎台湾，美国曾将大量空军用汽油运往台湾。据国民党台湾电台八月六日广播称：“美国海军油船西马兰号本日满载汽油抵基隆，以供防卫台湾空军之用。油船由第七舰队巡洋舰朱诺号和两驱逐舰护送。这批汽油据称麦克阿瑟元帅说系供双方（按指美蒋双方）需要。”
    随着美国侵略者空军的进驻台湾，美空军的“台湾前进指挥所”亦已成立。据国民党台湾电台八月十日广播：“美十三航空队调台服务人员一批乘军用飞机自马尼拉某基地起飞于八月十日十四时抵达松山机场。据悉该批人员即将参加前进指挥所服务。”该电台八月二十八日又称：第十三航空队“驻台指挥所工作颇为紧张繁忙”。
    上面所说的这些事实，完全证明了美国空军部所说的“并无美国飞机驻于台湾”，乃是一个漫天大谎。
    再次，美国侵略者的海军，在杜鲁门六月二十七日发出侵略声明后即开往台湾海峡。八月以来，该舰队舰只往来于基隆和高雄两海港极为频繁。综合国民党中央社的电讯，从八月五日到现在，先后抵达两港的美国巡洋舰、驱逐舰、运输舰等即达十一艘。就在美国海军部宣布美海军舰船“最近并未访问台湾”的前四天，即八月二十一日，两万五千吨的巡洋舰华塞斯脱芬就抵达基隆；二十二日，美第七舰队台湾海峡分队的兼指挥官米斯摩又乘瓦斯塔巡洋舰抵达基隆。而在美国海军部发表上述的无耻声明后两日，即八月二十七日，第七舰队台湾海峡分队的正式指挥官平弗特少将已乘巡洋舰圣保罗芬抵达基隆，并赴台北与国民党残匪进行会商。
    不但大批美国海军舰艇业已侵入台湾海港，而且美国海军第七舰队早已在台湾成立所谓“联络部”。据合众社台北七月二十四日电称：“第七舰队海军中校盖柏特已于本日到达台北，开始设立在台湾的海军联络部。”
    以上这一系列的事实，都证明了美国政府蓄意侵略中国领土台湾省，美国的海军、空军已擅自侵入中国的领海、领空，并在中国的领土台湾省设立军事基地，美国的军事使团已在台湾展开活动。所有这一切，已经无可辩驳地构成了美国武装侵略中国的犯罪行为。
