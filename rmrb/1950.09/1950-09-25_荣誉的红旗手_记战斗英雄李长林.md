Honorable Red Banner Bearer
    ——Remembering Combat Hero Li Changlin
    Shi Chao
  I. The glorious history of the 91st Regiment is inseparable from Li Changlin's heroic struggle.
    Li Changlin was born in 1915 into a poor peasant family in a remote village, enduring a life of suffering and poverty from a young age.
    At the age of sixteen, the Red Army (the predecessor of the People's Liberation Army) came to his village, and he joined the Red Army. His steadfastness and bravery led him to become a flag bearer. Under enemy fire, he held the large flag at the front of the charging troops, desperately running forward, storming enemy positions, and planting the red flag on enemy ground, guiding the troops to advance towards this banner of victory!
    The red flag inspired Li Changlin, and Li Changlin glorified the red flag and added to its honor.
    During the historically significant Long March of 25,000 Li, Li Changlin was one of the famous and heroic red soldiers.
    With the development of the revolutionary victory, the unit's designation changed three times – Red Army – Eighth Route Army – People's Liberation Army. Li Changlin also changed accordingly – starting as a soldier in this regiment, he is now the regiment commander. Although he no longer holds the red flag, he himself is a bright and honorable banner for his unit – superiors often praise him as a good cadre, the branch often praises him as a good party member, and he was awarded the title of Model Communist Party Member at the first Party Representative Congress of the entire division.
    The glorious history of the 91st Regiment is inseparable from the heroic struggle of Comrade Li Changlin.
  II. Bravery and resourcefulness combined
    When Li Changlin was a soldier, he was a brave combatant. As a commander, he was adept at combining his bravery with resourcefulness.
    After Japan's surrender, due to the despicable attempt by the Chiang and Yan bandits to seize the fruits of victory achieved with the blood and tears of the people, the famous Shangdang Campaign broke out in Shanxi in August 1945.
    A Chiang-Yan bandit army that had seized the people's city of Changzhi was tightly surrounded by the Eighth Route Army.
    Three enemy armies squeezed towards Changzhi day and night, attempting to relieve the siege of their comrades.
    The senior commanders of the Eighth Route Army quickly dispatched their troops to intercept the enemy head-on in the area of ​​Lao Ye Ridge, leaving these bandit troops helpless as they watched the deaths of their comrades.
    The enemy was as fast as rabbits, first occupying Da Shan (Big Mountain) and Xiao Shan (Small Mountain), while Li Changlin's unit, although running even faster than the enemy, arrived half a day late due to the long distance.
    In front of them were the mountains occupied by the enemy, and behind them was a plain that stretched as far as the eye could see. If they couldn't take down the enemy's front-most position, they would not only fail to stop the enemy but might also be suppressed by the enemy from a commanding height.
    The situation was serious.
    It had to be taken down; otherwise, the main force couldn't deploy, and the situation tomorrow was unimaginable.
    Li Changlin accepted this mission, at this time, he was a battalion commander.
    The entire battalion's strength was only two companies. The entire battalion's firepower consisted of only one heavy machine gun, six light machine guns, with each light machine gun having only two hundred rounds of ammunition. It was incredibly difficult to eliminate the enemy protected by layers of obstacles and strong fortifications with just over a hundred armed men and such weak firepower!
    "We can't attack head-on. If we attack head-on, the entire battalion won't come back," Li Changlin made this decision after carefully examining the terrain, utilizing all the daylight hours and identifying the enemy's fatal weakness – a ditch leading to the enemy's rear.
    In the dark of night, Li Changlin led the entire battalion's combat strength, following the ditch he had discovered during the day, which led to the enemy's weak point, stealthily approaching.
    When our grenades exploded in the enemy's bunkers and fortifications, bursting with fire and smoke, confusion, flight, and capture became the enemy's fate. More than twenty light and heavy machine guns, the enemy's two battalion's backpacks, and a large quantity of bullets became the spoils of Li Changlin's battalion.
    The next day, the main force deployed, and an even more important battle began.
    The enemy's main force was entrenched on the most dangerous and highest peaks in the area, Lao Ye Mountain and Mo Pan Mountain, tightly connected by a seven- or eight-Li-long communication trench along the mountain ridges, and had also built a strong position at Huai Shu Nao (Locust Tree Ridge) between the two mountains.
    It was very clear: taking Huai Shu Nao cut off the enemy, and the enemy would be doomed. Without taking it, we would still be at a disadvantage, and the enemy could suppress us at any time.
    The first attempt used two battalions of troops, but they retreated halfway up the mountain. The second attempt used five battalions, but they only reached the enemy's front line and retreated again.
    The third time, they went up – Li Changlin led his men up. The position was stabilized – Li Changlin commanded the troops to hold it.
    From the previous two failures, Li Changlin learned a lesson. When the task was placed on his shoulders, he looked for the enemy's weaknesses and attacked the enemy.
    At night, along the terraced fields on the side of the mountain, Li Changlin led five platoons, bypassed the enemy's flank, and circled behind the enemy. The enemy's strength behind them was sparse.
    Moving from the terraced fields into the deep ditch, advancing in the deep ditch.
    Li Changlin was responsible for the lives of these hundred-plus people, responsible for the hopes of the troops, and advancing forward, he dispelled people's concerns. Inspired by his strong confidence, how cautiously did the hundred-plus people move their steps! However, every step cost Li Changlin's blood, but every step also shortened the distance from the enemy. The difficult and dangerous road was passed in this way.
    Then, climb up and pounce over!
    The first soldier's bayonet pierced the enemy, and other enemies panicked and cursed, "Squad leader! Where did this madman come from, stabbing people randomly with a bayonet!"
    "Think I'm a madman, huh!" Li Changlin thought to himself, "I'm going to stab you all to death!"
    The battle was quickly resolved, but the enemy on the front position counterattacked.
    "It wasn't easy for us to sneak up here, and it'll be even harder for you to make us go down," Li Changlin ordered, resolutely resisting and resolutely attacking. The stubborn enemy met an even more stubborn people's soldier, like a stone meeting an iron hammer, slowly being smashed to pieces.
    When dawn broke, dozens of enemy light and heavy machine guns were placed on the enemy's position, but only the enemy was missing. Standing in the fortifications were Li Changlin and Li Changlin's soldiers.
    The loss of Huai Shu Nao was like a poisonous snake being cut in half at the waist, unable to connect head and tail, losing its power. The frantic enemy, in order to save its doom, drove all its forces to charge up the mountain, concentrating thirty cannons to bombard the mountain.
    The enemy's counterattacks came one after another, and the enemy's corpses also increased more and more with each attack. Li Changlin and his soldiers became more and more determined.
    The commander sent someone to ask, "Can you hold it?"
    "Yes!" Li Changlin said, "Tell the commander, please rest assured, we will definitely hold it!"
    The enemy's struggle became even more intense, and the commander sent someone to ask Li Changlin again, "What do you need?"
    "We don't need anything, just grenades. Bring grenades here!"
    The largest counterattack finally arrived. The enemy pounced like beasts, breaking through the front of the position and grabbing Li Changlin's only heavy machine gun.
    Victory or defeat was to be decided in this instant.
    "We can only win, we cannot fail!" Li Changlin told his soldiers.
    Under the resistance generated by Li Changlin's iron will, the enemy finally collapsed for the last time, and the enemy retreated completely. At this time, the entire blocking force also launched a full-scale attack.
    The enemy's three armies came to save the enemy entrenched in Changzhi from death, but they died even earlier than the enemy in Changzhi.
  III. Crossing the Yellow River's natural barrier and capturing Yangshan
    In a war two years later, Li Changlin's resourcefulness and bravery were put to a greater test, and he bore even greater responsibility. He was now the commander of a regiment bearing the lives of three thousand men. What he encountered was an even more stubborn and ferocious enemy, an enemy equipped with American weapons by American imperialism.
    July 1, 1947 – the anniversary of the birth of the Communist Party of China. Under Chairman Mao's strategic policy – turning defense into offense, changing interior line operations to exterior line operations, and leading the war to the enemy's occupied areas – General Liu Bocheng's troops broke through the enemy's defenses, crossed the natural barrier of the Yellow River, and opened the prelude to the counteroffensive, marching into the Chiang-controlled areas.
    At that time, although the enemy had been beaten dizzy, they were still quite strong. On the vast plains of Ji-Lu-Yu (Hebei, Shandong, Henan), they blocked the path of General Liu Bocheng's troops, and a bloody battle unfolded.
    General Liu Bocheng's troops were invincible. In twenty-three days, they annihilated nine and a half enemy brigades, including the 66th Division of Song Ruike's bandit troops, a direct line of Chiang Kai-shek, entrenched on and around Yangshan, stubbornly resisting General Liu Bocheng's troops, vainly attempting to buy time to allow Chiang Kai-shek's ace troops – the 5th Army, 11th Division, and other Chiang bandit troops – to come to their rescue.
    Due to command errors and insufficient coordination in individual units of our army, the initial attacks were unsuccessful, and the arrogance of the 66th Division bandits only grew. At this time, Chiang's bandit 5th Army and 11th Division were only five days away.
    In the final general offensive, General Liu Bocheng's determination was: Yangshan must be taken, and no meeting with the reinforcing enemy was allowed; otherwise, entanglement here would be unfavorable.
    Li Changlin and the regiment he led were responsible for the main attack on one side in this general offensive.
    In the two days and two nights before the general offensive, Li Changlin traveled all over the area he was responsible for attacking. He observed the enemy and the terrain in water that was up to his neck. He observed the enemy and the terrain under enemy fire.
    His scouts and communication soldiers were exhausted and could not support him, while he himself had not had a good meal or a good night's sleep during this time.
    The enemy's deployment on Yangshan was meticulous, but he still found a favorable road for attack, although sacrifices would still be required, it would be possible to exchange a small number of sacrifices for the greatest cost.
    He guided the digging of communication trenches. He personally arranged firepower and corrected targets. Before the attack, he personally went to the assault camp to mobilize, and his mobilization aroused the soldiers' unparalleled courage and hatred for the enemy.
    The general offensive began, and Li Changlin led his troops to attack the enemy along the planned route. The enemy's firepower fired fiercely, but Li Changlin and his well-trained troops smoothly rode onto the back of the Yang (sheep).
    The enemy could not let him ride on the sheep's back, otherwise the sheep's head and sheep's tail would be finished.
    The enemy's dying, frenzied counterattack swept towards the position occupied by Li Changlin's regiment like a storm.
    The enemy used money to buy dare-to-die squads to engage in a final battle with Li Changlin, with the price increasing from 10 yuan per person at the beginning to 40 yuan per person at the end. The counterattack went from the first to the thirtieth time.
    Wherever the enemy's dare-to-die squad pounced, the battle became fierce, and Li Changlin ran there to command the battle.
    The enemy's thirty counterattacks were completely defeated. At dawn, Li Changlin organized forces, concentrated firepower, and launched a fierce attack on the enemy, and the enemy finally collapsed.
    Chiang's bandit ace troops were still two days away. When they arrived, Yangshan had only left behind tens of thousands of enemy corpses, and Liu Deng's army had already marched into the Dabie Mountains.
  IV. Using a high degree of resourcefulness and courage to lure the enemy into battle
    The Liu-Deng army entering the Dabie Mountains was like inserting a sharp sword into the enemy's heart.
    The enemy did everything possible, frantically gathering thirty-three brigades (later renamed divisions) from various battlefields, chasing closely behind the Liu-Deng army like dogs, refusing to let go and wanting to drag the Liu-Deng army to death in the Dabie Mountains.
    In a situation where the enemy had an absolute advantage – a ratio of five to one – the troops pushed the mill with the enemy, looking for opportunities to annihilate the enemy. At the same time, they also tightly pulled the enemy into the Dabie Mountains, providing powerful coordination for the Shandong and Shaanxi battlefields that were the focus of the enemy's offensive at the time.
    The brigade to which Li Changlin belonged had been walking continuously for eighteen days without a moment's rest. The enemy was looking for them everywhere, and the towns were guarded by enemy strongholds. Battles could occur at any time, every day, and the troops were too exhausted.
    The brigade commander ordered Li Changlin to lead two battalions deep into the enemy's heart, lure out the enemy following the brigade, and allow the entire brigade to have a day of rest.
    This was a very difficult task and an extremely dangerous task. The troops were going to an area they were not familiar with in any situation to deal with a powerful enemy, and they had to strike the enemy in order to lure the enemy out. This required the commander to have a high degree of resourcefulness and courage.
    Li Changlin and his two battalions advanced directly towards the enemy at a speed of one hundred Li per day. After walking for a day and a night, they attacked Shannan Pass and captured dozens of high-ranking enemy Ministry of Defense officers and secret agents alive.
    At dawn, the enemy surrounded them with three regiments. The battle started, and the encirclement became tighter and tighter. Li Changlin, relying on his prepared observations, judgments, and perseverance, decided to strike the enemy's most pressing attack with one company and ordered everyone to break out towards the due south.
    Heading south meant heading deeper into the area occupied by the enemy, but this was the only correct direction.
    Beyond the enemy's expectations, Li Changlin safely walked out of the encirclement. On one hand, he let the troops stop to eat quickly. On the other hand, he set up a radio to report to the brigade headquarters. The message was sent – "...The enemy is encircling me, the seventh company suffered six or seven casualties..." Just as it was sent to this point, gunfire erupted, and the enemy again surrounded them with three regiments.
    The brigade commander received the suddenly interrupted fragmentary telegram, knowing that the situation was very tense, and mistakenly thought that the seventh company only had six or seven people left. The brigade commander was worried about Li Changlin. At this time, Li Changlin had victoriously broken through the second encirclement.
    The next day, he was blocked by the enemy again inside the Dabie Mountains. In front of him were large mountains that could not be climbed, and behind him were large mountains that could not be passed. Li Changlin, relying on his more than ten years of rich fighting experience and resourcefulness, found a gap in the enemy's defenses and safely emerged from the gap.
    When he led the two battalions to reunite with the brigade headquarters, the brigade had safely obtained three days of rest, carried out organizational consolidation, and prepared to fight with the enemy.
  V. Calmly judging the situation and pursuing and annihilating a fleeing enemy division
    The People's Liberation Army's Second Field Army under General Liu Bocheng advanced towards the southwest with overwhelming force, and the enemy was beaten everywhere, retreating and annihilated in succession.
    In the Chengdu Campaign, Li Changlin was ordered to lead two battalions of troops to collect fleeing enemy soldiers. Near Dayi, he discovered many footprints on the ground.
    Footprints were a very common thing, and no one paid attention to them. However, they aroused Li Changlin's great interest and concern.
    Li Changlin calmly judged that a large number of enemies must have escaped through this gap. If the enemies were allowed to escape, there would be no small future troubles.
    He decided to pursue the enemy with only his existing small force.
    Indeed, an enemy division had escaped through this gap.
    For a day and a night, he caught up with the enemy, grabbed hold of them, and the battle continued for a night. At dawn, the enemy frantically counterattacked, then the vanguard turned into the rearguard, attempting to turn around and escape.
    It was difficult to annihilate an enemy division with two battalions. Moreover, the enemy division's column was so long. Li Changlin relied on his resourcefulness and courage to solve this problem.
    He ordered the first battalion to attack the enemy's rearguard, and he led two companies of the second battalion to rush forward. He deployed a platoon on the road to block a gap where the enemy might escape and resolutely prevented the enemy from passing. After chasing for thirty Li, he inserted himself in front of the enemy, trapped the enemy, squeezed the enemy against a mountain, and completely annihilated the enemy's 28th Division.
    The commander of the 28th Division was also among the prisoners.
  VI. Even more, we must study hard and strive for progress
    Li Changlin has participated in the great revolutionary struggle for seventeen years. He has experienced countless battles. He has witnessed the troops evolve from the Red Army to the People's Liberation Army, from weak to strong, from tens of thousands of people to millions of people.
    During these difficult seventeen years of struggle, he displayed his resourcefulness and bravery. Six awards, three medals, and one certificate are the crystallization of his resourcefulness and bravery.
    But he understood very well that this was an honor given to him by the Party, and at the same time, he was grateful to the Party for cultivating him.
    He said: "In the future, I must study hard and strive for progress." (Attached picture)

　　荣誉的红旗手
    ——记战斗英雄李长林
    史超
  一、九十一团的光荣历史，是和李长林的英勇斗争分不开的
    一九一五年李长林出生在一个偏僻的小村庄的一家贫农家里，从小他就在痛苦穷困的生活中熬煎着。
    十六岁那年，他的村庄上来了红军（解放军的前身），他加入了红军。他的坚定勇敢，使他做了掌旗员，在敌人炮火下，他在冲锋部队的前头持着大旗拚命的向前跑，冲上敌人的阵地，把红旗插在敌人的阵地上，让部队朝着这面胜利的大旗前进！
    红旗鼓舞着李长林，李长林也给红旗发扬了光辉和增加了荣誉。
    有伟大历史意义的二万五千里长征，李长林是长征中有名的英勇红色战士之一。
    随着革命胜利的发展，部队的番号变了三次——红军——八路军——人民解放军，李长林也随着变动——开始是这个团的战士，现在是这个团的团长了。虽然他不再掌着那面红旗，但他这个“人”，就是他所在单位的一面鲜明荣誉的旗帜——上级常表扬他是好干部，支部常表扬他是好党员，在全师的第一届党代表大会上，被受予模范共产党员的称号。
    九十一团的光荣历史，是和李长林同志的英勇斗争分不开的。
  二、英勇和机智融汇在一起
    在李长林当战士的时候，他是一个勇敢的战斗员，而做一个指挥员时，他又是那样地善于使自己的英勇与机智融汇在一起。
    日本投降后，由于蒋、阎匪帮卑鄙的夺取用人民血和泪所取得的胜利果实，于是在一九四五年八月在山西爆发了有名的上党战役。
    强占了人民城市长治的蒋、阎匪一个军，被八路军团团的死困在里边。
    敌人三个军昼夜不停的向长治挤过来，企图解救他们同伙的围。
    八路军的高级指挥员迅速的派出了自己的部队，在老爷岭一带迎面阻击，使这伙匪军只能看着他同伙的死亡而毫无办法。
    敌人像兔子样的快，先占领了大山和小山，而李长林所在的部队虽然比敌人跑的更快，但过远的路程使他们迟来了半天。
    他们的面前是敌人占据的山，他们的背后是一眼看不到头的平原。如果不能把敌人最前面的阵地拿下来，那么不但不能阻挡敌人，也许就会被敌人居高临下的压下来。
    情况是严重的。
    必须把它拿下来，不拿下来主力无法展开，明天的情况是不能想像的。
    李长林接受了这个任务，这时他是营长。
    全营的人力，只有两个连。全营的火器只有一挺重机枪，六挺轻机枪，每挺轻机枪只有二百发子弹。以一百多个持枪的人和这样微弱的火器，去消灭在层层障碍和坚固工事保护下的敌人，是多么艰难啊！
    “不能硬攻，硬攻全营人就会回不来的。”李长林利用了白天所有的时间，仔细的把地形看过后，做出这样的决定。
    黑夜，李长林带着全营的全部战斗力量，顺着他白天发现的敌人致命的弱点——通向敌人屁股的一条沟，悄悄的摸上去。
    当我们的手榴弹在敌人的碉堡和工事中爆炸起来，崩裂出火光和浓烟的时候，慌乱、溃逃和做俘虏成了敌人的命运。二十余挺轻重机枪和敌人两个营的背包及大批的子弹，成了李长林营的胜利品。
    第二天，主力展开了，随着更重要的决斗就开始了。
    敌人主力盘据在这个地区最险要最高的老爷山和磨盘山头上，沿着山梁用一条七八里路长的交通沟紧紧的联系着，并在两山之间的槐树脑也构成了坚固的阵地。
    这是非常明白的：拿下槐树脑切断了敌人，敌人就要倒霉。拿不下，自己仍然处于不利的地位，敌人随时可以压下来。
    第一次使用了两个营的兵力，到了山半腰就退下来了。第二次五个营向上攻，只抵达敌人的前沿，又退了下来。
    第三次攻上去了——李长林带着人攻上去了。阵地稳住了——李长林指挥着队伍守住了。
    前两次的失败，李长林从中学得了教训。当任务放在他的肩上时，他寻找敌人的弱点，攻击敌人。
    夜晚，沿着山边的梯田李长林带着五个排从敌人侧翼插过去，迂回敌人的背后。敌人背后的兵力是稀薄的。
    由梯田转入深沟，在深沟中前进。
    李长林担当着这一百多人的生命，担当着部队的希望向前进，他化除了人们的顾虑。在他坚强的信心鼓舞下，一百多个人是多么谨慎的移动着自己的脚步啊，但每一步都费掉了李长林的心血，然而每一步却也缩短了离敌人的距离，艰难和危险的道路就这样的走过来了。
    于是，爬上去，扑过去！
    第一个战士的刺刀刺穿了敌人，其它敌人慌乱的骂：“班长！那里来的个疯子，拿刺刀乱刺人呀！”
    “看疯子的吧！”李长林心中想，“我要把你们都刺死！”
    很快的就解决了战斗，但是正面阵地上的敌人反扑过来。
    “我们摸上来不容易，你们让我们下去更不容易。”李长林命令坚决抵抗，坚决攻击。顽强的敌人遇到更加顽强的人民子弟兵，就像石块遇到了铁槌，慢慢的就敲打碎了。
    天大亮，几十挺敌人的轻重机枪放在敌人的阵地上，但只是不见了敌人，在工事里站着的是李长林和李长林的战士。
    槐树脑的丧失，就像毒蛇被利刃拦腰剁断一样，首尾不能联系，它就失去了力量。疯狂的敌人为了挽救它的末运，驱赶着全部人马向山上冲，集中三十门大炮向山上轰。
    敌人的反扑一次又一次，敌人的尸首也一次比一次增加，李长林和他的战士一次比一次更坚定。
    首长派人来问：“能坚守住吗？”
    “能！”李长林说：“告诉首长，请首长放心，一定能守住！”
    敌人的挣扎更加激烈了，首长又派人来问李长林：“你们需要什么？”
    “什么都不需要，只要手榴弹，有手榴弹就运来吧！”
    规模最大的一次反扑，终于来到了。敌人像野兽一样扑上来，突破了阵地的前沿，搂抱住了李长林唯一的重机枪。
    胜败就在这片刻内要决定了。
    “只能胜利，不能失败！”李长林告诉他的战士。
    敌人就在李长林这种铁的意志所产生的抵抗下，最后一次溃败了，敌人全线总退却了。这时，整个的阻击部队也全线出击了。
    敌人的三个军是来挽救盘踞长治的敌人的死亡的，但他却比长治的敌人死亡得还早。
  三、跨过黄河天险，夺取羊山
    二年以后的一次战争中，李长林的机智勇敢受到了更大的考验，他负的责任更大了，他已经是负担着三千人生命的一个团的团长了。他所遇到的是更加顽强凶恶的敌人，是美帝国主义用美械装备起来的敌人。
    一九四七年的七月一日——中国共产党诞生纪念的那一天，在毛主席的战略方针下——转守为攻，变内线作战为外线的作战，把战争引向敌人的占领区——刘伯承将军的部队突破了敌人的防御，跨过了天险黄河，揭开了反攻的序幕，向蒋管区进军。
    那时，敌人虽被打得头昏眼花了，但仍然是相当强大的。在冀鲁豫大平原上拦住了刘伯承将军所部的去路，血战就此展开了。
    刘伯承将军的部队是无敌的，二十三天内消灭了敌人九个半旅，其中的六十六师宋瑞珂匪部为蒋介石的嫡系，盘踞在羊山上下，对刘伯承将军部队据险顽抗，妄想争取时间，叫蒋介石的王牌军——五军、十一师，还有另外的蒋匪军赶来援救。
    由于我军个别部队，在指挥上发生错误，配合协调不够，开始攻击了几次，都没有成功，六十六师匪众的气焰反而高涨了。这时，蒋匪第五军、十一师只离那里仅有五天的路程了。
    举行最后的一次总攻，刘伯承将军的决心是：一定要把羊山打下来，决不和增援的敌人见面，否则扭缠在这里是不利的。
    李长林和他所带的团，在这一次总攻中担任一个方面的主攻。
    总攻前的两天两夜间，李长林把他所担任的攻击面的地区都跑遍了。他在淹着他脖子深的水里，观察敌人和地形。他在敌人的火力下，观察敌人和地形。
    随着他的侦察员和通讯员都疲倦得不能支持，而他自己在这个时间内也没好好吃过饭，睡过觉。
    羊山敌人的布置是周密的，但是他仍然找出了进攻有利的道路，虽然仍要牺牲，但是能以少数的牺牲，换取最大的代价。
    他指导着挖交通壕。他亲自布置火力和校正目标。在攻击前，他亲自到突击营去动员，他的动员激起了战士无比的勇气和对敌人的仇恨。
    总攻开始了，李长林率着部队顺着原定的道路向敌人攻击。敌人的火力猛烈的击射，但是李长林和他的久经锻炼的部队，顺利的骑到了羊背上。
    敌人无论如何不能让他骑在羊背上，否则羊头和羊尾也就完蛋了。
    敌人垂死的疯狂反攻，像暴风雨样卷向李长林团所占的阵地。
    敌人用钱收买敢死队，要和李长林进行最后决斗，价钱从最初每人十元直到最后每人四十元，反扑从第一次直到三十次。
    敌人的敢死队扑到那里，那里的战斗激烈了，李长林就跑到那里指挥战斗。
    敌人三十次的反扑，彻底被打垮。天亮，李长林组织了力量，集中了火力，向敌人举行了猛扑，敌人最后的垮台了。
    蒋匪王牌军还在两天路程之外，待他们赶到时，羊山仅遗留下万具敌人的尸首，而刘邓大军已向大别山挺进了。
  四、用高度的机智和魄力，引诱敌人作战
    刘邓大军进入大别山，就等于在敌人心脏上插了一把利剑。
    敌人尽其所有，慌慌张张的从各战场调集了三十三个旅（以后改称师），像狗一样紧紧的尾追在刘邓大军的后面。不肯放松，想要把刘邓大军拖死在大别山。
    在敌人占绝对优势——五与一之比的情况下，部队和敌人推开了磨，找寻机会消灭敌人。同时，也把敌人紧拉在大别山，给当时敌人重点进攻的山东陕北两战场，以有力的配合。
    李长林所在的旅，已经连续走了十八天，无片刻休息。敌人到处找他们，而且城镇中敌人都按有据点，战斗每天随时都要发生，部队是太疲倦了。
    旅首长命令李长林，带领两个营深入敌人心腹，把尾随着旅的敌人引诱出去，使全旅争取能够休息一天。
    这是个非常艰巨的任务，也是个极端危险的任务，部队到任何情况都不熟悉的地区去和强大的敌人周旋，而且要打击敌人，才能把敌人引出来，这是需要指挥员有高度的机智与魄力的。
    李长林和两个营以一天一百里的速度，直插向敌人，走了一天一夜，袭击了山南关，活捉了敌国防部高级军官及特务数十人。
    天亮，敌人以三个团的兵力围来了，打响了，越围越紧。李长林依靠着他准备的观察和判断以及毅力，决心以一个连打击敌人进攻最紧的一路，并命全体向正南方突围出去。
    向南方，就是更向敌人盘踞的地方，但是这是唯一正确的方向。
    李长林出乎敌人意料之外的，安全的走出了合击圈。一面让部队停止下来赶紧吃饭。一面架好电台向旅部报告。电码发出——“……敌人向我合击，七连伤亡六七人……”刚发至此处，枪声大作，敌人又以三个团的兵力合击拢来。
    旅的首长接到突然中断的片断电报，知道情况是非常紧张的，而误以为七连仅余六七人，旅的首长为李长林担着心，这时，李长林却胜利的突出了第二次的包围。
    第二天，在大别山里面又让敌人堵击住了，前有大山爬不上，后有大山走不通。李长林凭着他十几年的丰富斗争经验与机智，寻找出敌人的空隙，平安的从空隙中钻出来。
    当他率着两个营和旅部汇合时，旅已经安全的得到了三天的休息，进行了组织的整顿，并准备和敌人厮杀了。
  五、冷静地判断情况，追歼了逃敌一个师
    人民解放军刘伯承将军的第二野战军，以优势兵力排山倒海向西南进军，敌人到处挨打，纷纷败退就歼。
    成都战役，李长林奉命带两个营的兵力收容敌人溃兵，至大邑一带，发现地上有许多足印。
    足印是一件很平常的事情，谁都没去留心它。然而却引起了李长林的极大兴趣与关心。
    李长林冷静地判断，一定有众多的敌人从这漏网跑掉了，如果让敌人跑掉，将来后患不小。
    他决定仅以他现有的少数兵力，追击敌人。
    不错，的确敌人的一个师从这漏网了。
    一天一夜，追上了敌人，扭住了它，战斗进行了一夜，天亮敌疯狂反扑，然后前卫变后卫，企图反转逃走。
    用两个营来消灭敌人一个师，是多么困难的事啊，何况敌人一个师的行列又拉得那么长，李长林凭借他的机智和勇敢解决了这个问题。
    他命一营攻敌人后卫，他带着二营两个连向前赶，路上布置了一个排，堵住一个敌人可能逃走的口子，坚决不放敌人过去。紧追三十里后插至敌人前头，把敌人套住，硬挤到一座山边把敌人二十八师全部消灭了。
    二十八师的师长也是俘虏之一。
  六、更要好好学习，努力求得进步
    李长林参加伟大的革命斗争已经整十七年了，他经历了无数战斗，他亲眼看到部队由红军而人民解放军，由弱到强，由几万人到几百万人。
    他在这艰苦的十七年斗争中，发挥了他的机智与勇敢。六次奖励，三个奖章，一张奖状就是他机智与勇敢的结晶。
    但他非常明白这是党给他的荣誉，同时他感激党对他的培养。
    他说：“以后我更要好好的学习，努力求得进步。”（附图片）
