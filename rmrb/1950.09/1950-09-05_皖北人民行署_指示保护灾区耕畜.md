　　Anhui North People's Administrative Office
    Issues Instructions to Protect Draught Animals in Disaster Areas
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 29th] It has recently been discovered in the flood-stricken areas of Anhui North this year that disaster victims are selling or slaughtering draught animals due to a lack of fodder, resulting in considerable losses. There are still hundreds of thousands of draught animals in need of handling. After discovering this phenomenon, the Anhui North People's Administrative Office issued the "Instructions on Protecting Draught Animals in Disaster Areas" on August 24, requiring all localities to take the following measures to protect existing draught animals: (1) Preserve draught animals in situ. People's governments at all levels in disaster areas should call on the masses to store and conserve grass for feeding draught animals. (2) Move draught animals to grass. When disaster victims are relocated, draught animals can be moved along with them. People's governments at all levels in non-disaster areas must be responsible for resettling draught animals moved from disaster areas, and designate public mountains and barren ponds for grazing. If there are difficulties, a portion of relief grain may be temporarily allocated to exchange for grass to feed the animals. The relocated draught animals can cultivate land for the local masses for an appropriate fee. People's governments at all levels should call on disaster victims to place draught animals with relatives and friends in non-disaster areas for foster care, using animal power to compensate for foster care expenses. The government will provide appropriate assistance to households with difficulties. Disaster victims in severely affected areas who do not move can also organize a group of draught animals led by the owners to be resettled in lightly affected areas. (3) Move grass to draught animals. Along the Huai River and other areas with convenient transportation and close to non-disaster areas, neighboring areas in non-disaster areas can purchase and transport fodder for relief. Draught animals in disaster areas with poor transportation can also be moved to areas with convenient transportation, and then fodder can be purchased and transported for feeding. (4) Organs, troops, state-owned farms, and the masses in non-disaster areas south of the Huai River should systematically purchase and raise draught animals from disaster areas, and then the People's Bank will purchase and re-lend them to disaster victims during the spring plowing season. When units and the masses have difficulty purchasing draught animals, the government will provide appropriate loans to help. (5) Slaughtering draught animals is strictly prohibited. Draught animals that are disabled or too old to be used must obtain a certificate of inspection from the local tax bureau before they can be slaughtered. Finally, the instructions require people's governments at all levels to formulate specific implementation plans based on the above methods to effectively protect draught animals.

　　皖北人民行署
    指示保护灾区耕畜
    【新华社上海二十九日电】皖北今年遭受水灾地区近来发现灾民因草料缺乏出卖或宰杀耕畜，损失相当严重，现仍有耕畜数十万头，亟待处理。皖北人民行署发现这种现象之后，已于八月二十四日发出“保护灾区耕畜的指示”，要求各地采取下列办法保护现有耕畜：（一）就地保存耕畜。灾区各级人民政府应号召群众储草、节草饲养耕畜。（二）移耕畜就草。灾民转移时，可将耕畜随同转移。非灾区的各级人民政府须负责安置灾区移出的耕畜，并指定公山荒塘放养。如有困难，可暂拨放一部救济粮与灾民换草喂养。移出的耕畜可代当地群众耕种，取得适当代价。各级人民政府应号召灾民将耕畜放在非灾区的亲友处寄养，以畜力酬谢寄养费用。寄养户困难者，政府酌予帮助。重灾区不外移的灾民，亦可组织一部耕畜由畜主带领到轻灾区安置。（三）移草就耕畜。沿淮河及其他交通便利而又离非灾区较近者，可由非灾区的邻区购运草料前往救济。交通闭塞的灾区耕畜，亦可移至交通便利地区，再购运草料饲养。（四）机关部队、公营农场及淮南非灾区的群众应有计划地购买、饲养灾区的耕畜，到春耕时，再由人民银行收购转贷给灾民。各单位与群众购买耕畜困难时，政府酌予贷款扶助。（五）严禁宰杀耕畜。残废或病老不能使用的耕畜，须取得当地税局检验证，始得宰杀。最后，指示要求各级人民政府根据上述办法，订出具体实施计划，以切实保护耕畜。
