Xinhua News Agency, September 24th:

　　An unprecedented farce of self-slaughter has occurred between American aircraft and British troops on the Korean front. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tokyo on the 23rd, as many as 150 British soldiers were killed or wounded by American aircraft. Reuters reported the details of the incident as follows: On the 23rd, British troops, consisting of more than two companies, crossed the Nakdong River west of Daegu and advanced towards Seongju. When they occupied Hill 282 at noon on the 23rd, they sent a telegram requesting "United Nations" aircraft to support them and attack the Korean People's Army machine gun positions on the hillside. After the American aircraft arrived, the British troops quickly displayed marking panels. However, the American aircraft "did not bomb the communist army positions but instead bombed the hilltop." The American aircraft dropped many "terrible" napalm bombs and strafed with machine guns. Due to this "tragic bombing error, 150 British soldiers were killed or wounded within thirty minutes." "After the American aircraft flew away, the communist army immediately attacked the disorganized British troops. The British troops requested artillery support, but there was none. Because the Americans had withdrawn the artillery. The British troops, lacking support, were forced to retreat and suffered further heavy losses." "Burned British wounded soldiers were transported back across the Nakdong River at night under artillery fire."

　　According to Agence France-Presse, London, American Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Holmes, sent a letter to British Prime Minister Attlee on the evening of the 23rd, expressing "deep regret" for the American aircraft bombing of British troops; however, the letter also stated: "This tragic mistake made by the United States Air Force in identifying the target is one of those cruel accidents that are often difficult to avoid in the heat of war."

　　侵朝军队自相残杀的空前丑剧
    英军要求“联合国”飞机支援
    美机匆忙投弹炸毙待援英军
    【新华社二十四日讯】在朝鲜前线美国飞机与英军之间，又演出了一次规模空前的自相屠杀的丑剧。据路透社东京二十三日电称：英军被美机炸死、炸伤者达一百五十人之多。路透社报道这一事件的经过情形称：二十三日，英军结集两连以上的兵力，在大邱以西渡过洛东江，向星州进犯。当他们于二十三日中午占领了二八二号山头时，他们发电要求“联合国”飞机来支援他们，袭击山坡上的人民军机枪阵地。美国飞机飞来之后，英军连忙摆出标志牌。但美机“不去炸共军阵地，反而去炸山头”。美机投掷了许多“可怕的”固体汽油燃烧弹，并以机枪扫射。由于这一“悲剧的轰炸错误，英军在三十分钟内被炸死、炸伤的达一百五十人。”“在美机飞走后，共军即进攻混乱不堪的英军。英军要求炮兵支援，可是什么都没有了。因为美国人已把大炮撤走。英军由于没有支援，被迫退却，再度受到重大的损失。”“被烧伤的英国伤兵，在炮火轰击下，于夜间运回了洛东江”。
    另据法新社伦敦讯，美国驻英代办荷谟斯于二十三日晚致函英首相艾德礼。对美机轰炸英军事件，表示“深深的歉意”；但该函又称：“美国空军在辨明目标时所犯的这一悲剧性错误，是在战争炽热时常难常于避免的残酷的意外事件之一。”
