　　Austrian Youth Marching Towards the Road of Resolute Struggle
    An Interview with Austrian Representative Grom
    For five years, Austria has been occupied by the four powers of the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France, and divided into four occupation zones. The United States has tried every means to obstruct the conclusion of a treaty with Austria and stubbornly refuses to withdraw from the country. The Austrian reactionary government, relying on the United States, is afraid that once the American troops withdraw, it will be unable to suppress the people's resistance in order to maintain its sinful rule. Therefore, it vainly attempts to organize an army of 60,000 people. However, the Austrian people—especially the Austrian youth—launched a powerful protest to prevent it from organizing an army to suppress the people, forcing the reactionary government to resort to illegal means to expand the police force to 35,000. These police officers have received special training from American officers and have become a disguised army.
    The Austrian reactionary government is implementing the American Marshall Plan, so they also clamor for war and oppose the peace movement. Anyone who signs a peace declaration will be dismissed from their job, and any actions promoting peace or opposing aggression will be suppressed. Despite such fierce oppression, thanks to the efforts of Austrian youth, the number of people participating in the peace signature campaign nationwide has reached 750,000 within three months, accounting for 20 percent of the national population.
    Since the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Austrian peace movement has surged even higher. Many young people hung signs reading "Oppose the Aggression Against Korea" and demonstrated in front of the American embassy. On the streets of the American occupation zone in Vienna, slogans such as "Korea Belongs to the Korean People" frequently appeared. The Americans were filled with shame and indignation and ordered the police to erase them, but they reappeared the next day. The residents of Vienna unanimously believe that the American imperialists have a guilty conscience and cannot withstand the stimulation of such just slogans.
    The unemployed population in Austria is increasing, and unemployment has the greatest impact on young people. Currently, there are 150,000 unemployed people. Generally, young people often cannot find jobs after graduating from school, nor can they get internships in factories. In 1947, a youth demonstration was held in Petitschur, demanding that young people have milk to drink. The American imperialists instigated the reactionary government to suppress it, arresting the leading leader, Schumpenik, and sentencing him to ten years in prison. However, he contracted lung disease after being in prison for only one year, arousing angry protests from young people across the country. The reactionary government had no choice but to release him.
    Young people clearly see the crimes of war. In the last war, 500,000 Austrian youths were driven to the battlefield by German fascists and died or went missing. Nearly 10,000 people were disabled in the war, and the reactionary government provided them with no care, leaving them to wander the streets. In Vienna alone, 25 percent of the houses were destroyed by American air raids during the war, and there is still a housing shortage. In this city, more than 80,000 residents cannot find housing.
    According to statistics from 1948, there were 35,000 university students nationwide, most of whom came from the middle class. However, the war impoverished them, so most university students have to rely on part-time work to support themselves. The lives of teaching assistants, lecturers, and professors are also very difficult. The funds for education, art, and cultural undertakings in the national budget account for only 0.69 percent, which is pitifully small.
    Austria has always been proud of being a cultural country, having produced world-famous musicians such as Mozart and Schubert. However, current musical performances are not for the people but are specifically designed to cater to the enjoyment of Americans. For example, the price of a concert ticket is equivalent to a worker's weekly wage, so ordinary people cannot enjoy such musical performances. Vienna is world-renowned for its music, but two-thirds of its musicians are now unemployed. The most famous national theater was bombed during the war and has only now begun to be repaired. The famous musicians who used to perform here, driven by the pressure of life, play with tears in front of these ruins, while their wives help collect tips from the audience.
    From this, it can be seen that the youth of Austria are extremely dissatisfied with the reality and urgently demand to change it. In 1945, after Austria was liberated by the Soviet army, young people from various parties and factions organized the Free Austrian Youth League to carry out anti-fascist struggles. Later, some young people, under the influence of reactionary parties such as the Socialist Party and the People's Party, split off, but the league has not only not been weakened but has grown stronger. Due to the extremely sharp struggle and the deterioration of the domestic political and economic situation, the Austrian youth have quickly awakened and, under the leadership of the league, are marching towards the road of resolute struggle.

### 奥地利青年走向坚决斗争的道路  访问奥地利代表葛罗姆

　　奥地利青年走向坚决斗争的道路
    访问奥地利代表葛罗姆
    五年来，奥地利一直被美、苏、英、法四个国家占领着，划分为四个占领区。美国曾千方百计地阻挠订立对奥和约，死也不肯撤离奥国。奥国的反动政府投靠美国，为了维持其罪恶的统治，害怕美军一旦撤离，就无法镇压人民的反抗，因此妄想组织一支拥有六万人的军队。但奥国的人民——特别是奥国的青年发动有力的抗议，阻止它组织军队来镇压人民，逼得反动政府只好用不合法的手段，来扩充警察员额达到三万五千人。这些警察曾受过美国军官特别训练，已成为变相的军队。
    奥国反动政府是奉行美国马歇尔计划的，因此他们也叫嚣战争，反对和平运动，谁要是在和平宣言上签名，他的工作就会被解除，任何宣传和平、反对侵略的行动，都受到压制。尽管压迫得这么凶，但由于奥国青年的努力推进，在三个月内，全国参加和平签名的人数，已达七十五万，占全国人口的百分之二十。
    自从美国对朝鲜发动侵略战争以后，奥国和平运动更加高涨，有许多青年挂着“反对侵略朝鲜”的标语牌，到美国使馆门前示威。维也纳美军占领区的街头，经常出现“朝鲜属于朝鲜人民”的标语，美国人看了羞愤交加，叫警察把它擦掉，可是第二天又重新出现了。维也纳居民一致认为美帝做贼心虚，经不起这种富有正义的标语的刺激。
    奥国的失业人口在增加，而失业对青年的影响最大。现有失业人口十五万人，一般青年从学校毕业之后，往往得不到工作，也不可能进工厂实习。在一九四七年，在裴特依丘尔曾经举行过一次青年示威，要求青年人要有牛奶吃，美帝嗾使反动政府加以镇压，把为首的领导者徐姆泼尼克加以逮捕，判了十年徒刑。但他进狱一年，即害了肺病，激起全国青年愤怒的抗议，反动政府不得不释放了他。
    青年们看清楚战争的罪恶，在上次大战中，奥国青年被德国法西斯驱使到战场上死亡或失踪的就有五十万人。在战争中成为残废的有近万人，反动政府对他们毫无照顾，让他们流落在街头。以维也纳一地而论，战时遭美机轰炸，房屋损失了百分之二十五，至今仍闹房荒，在这座城市中，有八万多居民找不到住所。
    据一九四八年统计，全国有大学生三万五千人，其中大部分为中等阶级出身，但战争使他们穷困，因此大学生中大部分得靠半工半读来维持。助教、讲师和教授的生活，也都很窘。国家预算中，教育、艺术和文化事业的经费，仅占百分之零点六九，微小得可怜。
    奥国一向以文化国家自豪，出过世界著名的音乐家像莫扎尔特、苏贝尔脱。但是现在的音乐表演，不是为人民，而专为迎合美国人的享受。例如，音乐会的门票价，要抵得一个工人一周的工资，普通人就无法欣赏这种音乐表演。维也纳以音乐蜚声世界，但现在失业的音乐家就占三分之二。当地最著名的国家剧院战时被炸后，到现在才开始修葺。当年在此奏演的著名音乐家，为生活所迫，就在这个残垣断墙前面，含泪演奏，他们的太太就帮助向听众收赏钱。
    从此可以看到，全奥国的青年，对现实异常不满，迫切的要求改变它。在一九四五年，奥国被苏军解放之后，各党各派的青年，曾经组织了自由奥国青年联盟，进行反法西斯斗争。后来一部分青年，在反动党派，如社会党、人民党影响下分裂了出去，但联盟不仅没有受到削弱，反日益发展壮大。由于斗争异常尖锐，而国内政治经济形势的恶化，更使奥国的青年，很快的觉醒起来，在联盟的领导下，走向坚决斗争的道路。（附图片）
