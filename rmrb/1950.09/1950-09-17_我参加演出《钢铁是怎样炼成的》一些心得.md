　　Some Experiences of Participating in the Performance of "How the Steel Was Tempered"
    Li Jia

    The play "How the Steel Was Tempered" has started rehearsals, and I was assigned the role of the Red Army soldier Sergei, a member of the Communist Youth League. This is the first time since I started acting that I have encountered a script with such strong political content and high ideological value, and it is also the first time I have encountered a character who is so far away from me in terms of ideology and life. I am really anxious, what should I do? The task is assigned, and the problem must be solved!

    I should first approach the character ideologically and in life, and then talk about performing the character. I am determined to transform my own thoughts and feelings in the process of creating such a character, and strive to be a New Democratic Youth League member.

    At the script discussion meeting, I announced to everyone: "My political and ideological level, actual combat experience, and the character are all very far apart. The day I can catch up with the character, I will ask to join the Youth League." With the goal set, I am constantly undergoing training in this area, anytime, anywhere, little by little.

    The theater department called on everyone to voluntarily participate in labor in order to build a small road. At first, I intentionally wanted to experience the scene of "building roads at the station" in the sixth scene of the play through this labor; however, later I was immersed in the labor. The next day, I continued to work, and I found that several lazy comrades were playing chess indoors, and one or two barely moved a few bricks and then slipped away. I felt a little shaken, and wanted to wash my hands and take a break. But when I thought of the sixth scene in the play "...they soaked in the mud for two months in order to supply firewood to the city and keep the city's factories running, and worked four shifts in a row, but the people who were supposed to take over the shift had not yet arrived. Finally, the Communist Party members and Youth League members stayed behind and did not return to the city..." when they persisted in this work to the end, I suddenly asked myself: "Do you want to be a runaway worker in the play?" If so, how can you play the good League member Sergei who scolds runaway workers? How can you portray this Red Army soldier who loves labor? Thinking of this, I overcame my backward thoughts and happily persisted in labor until the last day. When I walked on the small road that I also participated in building, I felt very happy. Half a year ago, I would have been annoyed by this kind of labor that made me sweaty all over, but now I have found happiness in labor.

    One day during rehearsals, I fell ill, caught a cold, had a high fever, and felt weak all over, but I didn't want to ask the director for leave, fearing that it would delay the work schedule; even more, I didn't want her to know, fearing that it would affect the rehearsals; I insisted on finishing the play, although I couldn't stand steady after coming off the stage, but I always cheered myself up on the stage, because I thought of Paul, who insisted on working and struggling even when he lost his hands and feet and was paralyzed by illness... What is my little illness?

    During the rehearsal process, in order to make the script more complete, the director deleted two scenes, both of which I appeared in. The director apologized to me for this issue, and in order to dispel her concerns, I calmly and frankly said to her: "As long as it is for the sake of work, for the sake of making the play better, please don't worry about me." The problem was solved. At the time, I was very clear in my mind that doing so was right, but I still had some emotional fluctuations. At this time, I thought of Paul again, thought of the main task of the League branch during this period was to ensure that the play "How the Steel Was Tempered" was performed well, and thought that using the standards of a Youth League member to demand myself, I should sacrifice personal interests and obey the overall interests, and then I became calm.

    During the "August 1st" Army Day parade, I was assigned the job of carrying a two-person-high portrait of Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Beforehand, I was muttering in my heart: "It's best not to be assigned to me." But finally it was assigned to me. For an intellectual who has never carried heavy things, this is indeed a considerable test. I thought: "If I don't carry it, you don't carry it, and he doesn't carry it, then who will carry it? Don't you usually love to talk glibly about obeying the work assigned by the organization? Why do you plan to escape when faced with a test?" When I thought that if I wanted to be a Youth League member, I should take the lead in various revolutionary tasks, I mustered the courage to carry it; when I returned to the theater after completing the task and took off my shirt, two red marks were exposed on both shoulders from being pressed. ...Just as Sergei said: "Where does this strength of people come from?!"

    During the period of Kuomintang rule, when the student movement reached its climax, I escaped from the struggle, taking pride in not asking about politics, and fearing death under the pretext of "art for art's sake." Once at a "strike" evening party, I participated in a satirical skit that satirized special agents, and I was worried about being beaten. Now, when I heard Paul say: "...The most precious thing a person has is life. Life is only once for us. A person's life should be spent like this: when he looks back on the past, he does not regret wasting his years, nor is he ashamed of his past mediocrity. In this way, when he is dying, he can say: I have dedicated my entire life and energy to the most magnificent cause in the world—the struggle for the freedom and liberation of mankind!" I felt ashamed of my past cowardice.

    Today I understand why many Communist Party members can do so many extraordinary heroic deeds—when they are tortured by the enemy, they are unyielding to the death, just as Sergei said: "Once a person has the support of doctrine, then all his actions will turn out very beautifully."

    Through this bit-by-bit study and training, and through the inspiration and education of rehearsing "How the Steel Was Tempered," I want to transform my thinking and strive to join the League, seek the support of "doctrine," and make life more meaningful. Finally, I was finally approved to be a formal member of the New Democratic Youth League. Now, whenever I encounter difficulties, as soon as I think that I am a Youth League member and think of the model of youth—Paul—I have strength and confidence.

    Although I have joined the League and gradually approached the character ideologically and emotionally, this does not mean that I can definitely play the character well, and I still need to learn more.

    Many famous Soviet actors are Communist Party members, which is not accidental, because what they perform reflects the activities of the Party. Real life is led by the Communist Party. Without a high degree of Party spirit, it is impossible to understand real life. If you don't understand real life, how can you create the correct image? An actor without Party spirit cannot perform well (this does not mean that a Party member can definitely perform well), because only correct thinking can produce correct actions, correct actions can produce correct feelings, and with correct feelings can produce a real and moving image!

　　我参加演出《钢铁是怎样炼成的》一些心得
    李家
    《钢铁是怎样炼成的》这个剧开排了，我被分配担任的角色是红军战士谢利达，他是个共产主义青年团员。演戏以来第一次接触到这样富有强烈的政治内容与高度思想性的剧本，也是第一次碰到在思想上，生活上与自己距离这样远的角色。真着急，怎么办呢？任务下来了，问题总得设法解决啊！
    我应该首先从思想上，生活上去接近角色，其次才能谈到表演角色。我下定决心，要在创造这样一个角色的过程中，改造自己的思想感情，争取做一个新民主主义青年团员。
    在剧本讨论会上，我向大家宣布：“我的政治思想水平，实际战斗生活的体验和角色都距离很远，有一天我能追上角色了，我就要请求加入青年团。”目标决定了，我随时随地，一点一滴的在这方面历经着锻炼。
    剧院院部为了修筑一条小路，号召大家自动参加劳动。开始，我是有意的想在这次劳动中体验一下剧中第六景“车站筑路”的那场戏；可是，后来却溶化在劳动里了。第二天，又接续着干，我发现，几位偷懒的同志在室内下棋，有一两位勉强搬了几块砖头之后溜掉了，我心里有些动摇，也想洗洗手休息休息去。但是当我想到第六景戏里“……他们为了供给城里木柴烧，使城里的工厂开动起来，在烂泥坑里泡了两个月，连干了四次班，但是换班的人还没有来齐，最后共产党员和青年团员留下来不回城里去。……”他们把这工作坚持到底时，我忽然责问自己：“难道你想做戏里的逃工吗？”如果这样，你怎么能演好痛骂逃工的好团员谢利达呢？怎么能表演这位热爱劳动的红军战士呢？想到这里，我克服了落后思想，愉快的坚持劳动到最后一天。当我走在我也参加劳动筑成的小路上时，我感到十分愉快。半年前，我一碰到这种满身臭汗的劳动就心烦，而现在却在劳动中找到了愉快。
    有一天排戏，我病倒了，感冒，发高烧，浑身没力气，但是我不愿意向导演请假，怕拖延了工作日程；更不愿意让她知道，怕影响排戏；我一直坚持把戏排完，虽然下了台就站不稳，可是在台上时我却始终振作精神，因为我想到了保尔在他失掉了手脚，病重瘫痪的时候，他还是坚持工作，奋斗下去……我这点小病又算得了什么呢？
    在排演过程中，导演为了要使剧本更为完整，将戏删掉了两场，这两场都有我出场，导演非常抱歉地对我谈到这个问题，为了打破她的顾虑，我冷静而坦白的向她说：“只要为了工作，为了把戏搞好，请你不要顾虑到我”。问题算是解决了。当时在理性上，我很清楚的认识到这样作是对的，但我在情绪上还是有些波动。这时，我又想到了保尔，想到了团支部这一时期的主要工作任务是保证把《钢铁是怎样炼成的》这个剧演好，想到了拿青年团员的标尺来要求自己，就应该牺牲个人利益服从整个利益时，也就心平气和了。
    “八一”建军节游行，我被分配的工作是抬两人高的朱总司令大画像。事前我心里就在嘀咕着：“最好别派到我。”可是终于被派到头上来了。对于一个向来没有挑担过笨重东西的知识分子，这实在是个不小的考验。心想：“我不抬，你不抬，他也不抬，那叫谁去抬呀？平常不是爱高谈阔论服从组织分配的工作吗？怎么面临考验，就打算逃避了呢？”当我想到：假如我想做一个青年团员，就应该在各种革命工作中起带头作用的时候，我就拿出了勇气抬起来了；在完成任务回到剧院脱下上衣时，两边肩上露出了被压得红红的两块。……正如谢利达所说：“人的这股力量是从那里来的？！”
    在国民党统治时期，学生运动达到高潮时，我却逃避在斗争之外，以不问政治为清高，在“为艺术而艺术”的借口下，贪生怕死。有一次“罢课”晚会上我参加演了一个讽刺匪特的活报剧，就提心吊胆，怕挨打。现在，当我听到了保尔说：“……人最宝贵的东西是生命。生命于我们只有一次而已。一个人的生命应当这样度过的：当他回首往事时，他不因虚度年华而悔恨，也不因过去的碌碌无为而羞耻。这样，他在临死的时候，就能够说：我整个的生命与精力，都已献给世界上最壮丽的事业——为人类的自由与解放而作的斗争！”的时候，我才对过去的怯懦感到羞耻。
    今天我才了解，为什么许多共产党员，他们能够做出许多不平常的英雄业迹——在被敌人非刑拷打时，至死不屈，正像谢利达所说：“人一有了主义的支持，那么他所有一切的事情结果都会弄得很漂亮。”
    经过这一点一滴的学习与锻炼，通过了排演《钢铁是怎样炼成的》的启发与教育，我要改造思想争取入团，寻求“主义”的支持，让生命过得更有意义。最后，我终于被批准为新民主主义青年团的正式团员了。现在每当我遭遇到困难的时候，一想到我是青年团员，想到了青年的模范——保尔就有了力量和信心。
    我虽然入了团，从思想感情上逐渐的靠近角色，但是这样并不就等于说一定能演得好这个角色，还需要更多的学习。
    苏联的许多名演员都是共产党员，这不是偶然的事情，因为他们所表演的东西都是反映了党的活动。现实生活是由共产党所领导的，如果没有高度的党性，就无法了解真实的生活，不了解真实的生活怎么能创造出正确的形象来呢？没有党性的演员是演不好戏的（这也并不等于说党员一定能演得好戏），因为只有正确的思想才能产生正确的行动，正确的行动才能产生正确的感觉，有了正确的感觉才能产生真实动人的形象！
