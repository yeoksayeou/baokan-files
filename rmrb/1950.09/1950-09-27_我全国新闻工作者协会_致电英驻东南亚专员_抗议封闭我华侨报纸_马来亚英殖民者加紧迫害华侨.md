Xinhua News Agency, 26th—The persecution of overseas Chinese by the British colonial authorities in Malaya is intensifying. According to reports from *Nanyang Siang Pau* (note: this newspaper was unreasonably closed by the British authorities on September 21st): In August, the British colonialists in Malaya decided to implement the "relocation" of more than 20,000 residents in seven suburban areas of Kuala Lumpur near forested regions. The majority of these residents are overseas Chinese, who will be forced to become displaced. On July 15th, the British colonial authorities in Selangor Province invoked the "Emergency Ordinance" to order more than 700 residents in the Serdang area to "relocate" elsewhere within a week, or all their houses would be burned down. On July 1st and 10th, in Johor and Perak states, more than 2,000 residents were also forced to "relocate," most of whom were overseas Chinese, leaving them homeless.

The British colonial authorities in Malaya are also invoking the so-called "Emergency Ordinance" to expel large numbers of overseas Chinese. According to an August 3rd report in *Nanyang Siang Pau*: The Malayan Union government announced that 728 "foreign nationals" were "repatriated" in June and July, the vast majority of whom were also overseas Chinese.

    【新华社二十六日讯】马来亚英殖民当局对该地华侨的迫害正变本加厉。综合《南侨日报》（按该报已于九月二十一日被英国当局无理封闭）消息：马来亚英国殖民者八月间曾决定将吉隆坡市郊七个接近森林地区的居民二万余人实行“迁移”，占居民大部的华侨，将被迫流离失所。七月十五日，雪兰峨州英殖民当局曾援用“紧急法令”，限令士拉映地区居民七百余名于一周内“迁移”别处，否则将焚毁所有民房。七月一日及十日，在柔佛和霹雳二州亦曾有居民二千余人被迫“迁移”，其中大部为华侨，他们均因此无家可归。
    马来亚英殖民当局并援引所谓“紧急法令”，驱逐大批华侨出境。据《南侨日报》八月三日消息：马来亚联合邦政府宣布：六、七两月中被“遣送”出境的“外侨”达七百二十八名，其中绝大部分亦为华侨。
