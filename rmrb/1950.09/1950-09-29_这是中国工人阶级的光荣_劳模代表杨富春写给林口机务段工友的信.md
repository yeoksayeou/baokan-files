　　"This is the Glory of the Chinese Working Class"
    Labor Model Representative Yang Fuchun's Letter to Fellow Workers of the Linkou Locomotive Depot

Comrades Leaders of the Linkou Depot and all fellow railway workers!

    I have been attending the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers for two days now. I feel so honored and excited, but also ashamed and uneasy. I am an ordinary railway worker, without technical skills and with a low level of education. In the old society, I and other fellow workers were subjected to oppression and exploitation from all sides. Today we are able to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers, and also be elected to the Presidium of the Congress. This is the glory of the Chinese working class! Only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao can we have this glory today. When I see Chairman Mao, I will definitely convey everyone's regards to him and give my respects to all the leaders. On the way to Beijing, we received warm welcomes and farewells and cordial receptions from people from all walks of life. Fellow workers at the stations along the route stood in lines, waving flags and cheering us. On the one hand, I am excited, and on the other hand, I am ashamed: everyone's contribution is as vast as the sea, and without everyone, I have no strength. I will definitely learn humbly from labor models from all over the country. At the same time, I hope that the fellow workers on site will strive to carry out a great production competition on the existing work basis, implement the economic accounting system, raise vigilance, eliminate accidents, and offer this as a gift to the Congress and the first National Day of the People's Republic of China. Let us cheer:

    Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Liberation Army! Long live the great unity of workers, peasants, and soldiers! Long live the Chinese Communist Party! Long live Sino-Soviet friendship! I wish all fellow workers good health!

          Respectfully,
          Yang Fuchun, Chairman of the Linkou Locomotive Depot Trade Union
                  26th

　　“这是中国工人阶级的光荣”
    劳模代表杨富春写给林口机务段工友的信林口段首长同志及全路工友们！
    我出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议，已经两天了。我感到那样光荣、兴奋，同时也感到惭愧、不安。我是一个平常的铁路工人，没有技术，文化程度也不高。在旧社会里，我和其他工友们一样受到各方面的压迫和剥削。今天我们能够出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议，又被推选为大会主席团，这是中国工人阶级的光荣！只有在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们才能有今天的光荣。见了毛主席，我一定代表大家向他问安，给各位首长问安。在进京的路上，我们受到各界人民热烈的欢迎欢送及亲切的招待；沿线各个车站的工友们，排着队，高举着旗帜向我们欢呼。我一方面兴奋，一方面又惭愧：大家伙的功劳似海大，我离开了大家伙就没有什么力量了。我一定虚心向各地劳模学习。同时也希望现场的工友，在现有的工作基础上努力进行生产大竞赛，执行经济核算制，提高警惕，消灭事故，来作为对大会及中华人民共和国第一个国庆日的献礼。让我们欢呼：
    毛主席万岁！人民解放军万岁！工农兵大团结万岁！中国共产党万岁！中苏友好万岁！敬祝全体工友身体健康！
          林口机务段工会主席杨富春敬礼
                  二十六日
