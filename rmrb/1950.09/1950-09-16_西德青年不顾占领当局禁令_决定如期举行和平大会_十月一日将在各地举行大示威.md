Xinhua News Agency, Dusseldorf, 15th: According to the German News Agency, the West German Youth Peace Fighters Committee has reiterated that West German youth, despite the ban of the West German occupation authorities and the puppet government, are determined to hold a 100,000-youth peace congress and a youth peace fighters representative congress in the Ruhr area from September 30th to October 1st as scheduled.

In a resolution passed on September 10th, the West German Youth Peace Fighters Committee solemnly pointed out that the reason why the West German authorities banned the youth from holding peace gatherings was because they feared that "as long as the youth have the will to fight for peace, imperialism will not be able to find cannon fodder in West Germany." The resolution emphasized: Maintaining peace is the wish of every honest person. No matter how furiously the warmongers rage, no matter how loudly they clamor, the will to support peace cannot be forbidden. If the puppet authorities and their masters think that peace-loving youth can be intimidated by bans and terror, they are mistaken.

The resolution concluded: "On October 1st, young men and women will hold grand demonstrations throughout West Germany. No one can stop the youth from loudly proclaiming their will to support peace. Our answer to the warmongers' bans and terror is: On that day, organize one hundred new youth peace fighters committees, set up one thousand peace gatherings, and collect the signatures of one hundred thousand people on the peace declaration."

　　西德青年不顾占领当局禁令
    决定如期举行和平大会
    十月一日将在各地举行大示威
    【新华社十五日讯】据德意志通讯社杜塞尔多夫讯：西德青年和平战士委员会，顷重申西德青年不顾西德占领当局与傀儡政府的禁令，决心如期于九月三十日至十月一日在鲁尔区举行十万青年拥护和平大会和青年和平战士代表大会。
    西德青年和平战士委员会在九月十日通过的决议中，严正指出西德当局之所以禁止青年们举行和平集会，是由于害怕“只要青年们具有争取和平的意志，帝国主义便无法在西德找到炮灰”。决议强调声明：保持和平是每一个诚实的人的愿望。不管战争贩子们怎样暴跳如雷，不管他们怎样大声叫嚣，拥护和平的意志是禁止不了的。假如傀儡当局和他的主子以为爱好和平的青年能被禁令和恐怖所吓倒，那他们便错了。
    决议最后宣称：“在十月一日那一天，青年男女们将在全西德各地举行盛大的示威。没有人能够阻止青年们大声宣告他们拥护和平的意志。我们对战争贩子的禁令和恐怖的答复是：到那一天组织一百个新的青年和平战士委员会，布置一千个和平集会，并征集十万人在和平宣言上签名。”
