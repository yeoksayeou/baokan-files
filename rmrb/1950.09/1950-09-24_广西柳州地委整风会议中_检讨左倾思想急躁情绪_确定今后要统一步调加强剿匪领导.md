　　In the Rectification Meeting of the Liuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Guangxi,
    Left-Leaning Ideologies and Impetuous Emotions Were Reviewed,
    and it Was Determined That in the Future, Efforts Should Be United to Strengthen the Leadership of Bandit Suppression
    [This newspaper's report] The Liuzhou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Guangxi convened a rectification meeting on July 11 to summarize and examine the leadership work at the prefectural committee level. Thirty-nine cadres, including county party secretaries from various counties, attended. At the meeting, Li Yiping, the secretary of the prefectural committee, first gave a summary and inspection report on the work of the past eight months and the ideological style of the prefectural committee's leadership. The report first pointed out that the prefectural committee had achieved considerable success in the main tasks in the area over the past eight months, such as bandit suppression, rent reduction and deposit refund movement, and grain requisitioning. In the past eight months, a total of 11,246 bandits were annihilated. In the areas that have undergone the rent reduction and deposit refund movement, the peasants have received more than 5.7 million catties of grain. The difficulties of spring plowing have been basically resolved, the summer famine has been successfully overcome, the enthusiasm for production has been increased, and more than 24,000 mu of new land has been reclaimed. However, many serious errors and shortcomings have occurred in the implementation of various major policies. First of all, the prefectural committee did not pay enough attention to the leadership of bandit suppression. In some areas, the troops have not yet established the idea of localization, failed to mobilize the masses well, and launched a mass bandit suppression movement, and neglected political offensives, thus making the banditry still seriously exist. Secondly, there was insufficient unity with the middle peasants in various rural works. Some areas infringed upon the interests of the middle peasants, causing them unease and dissatisfaction. For example, some places stipulated that middle peasants should have a three-month probationary period to participate in the farmers' association; grain was borrowed from middle peasants and even individual poor peasants. Thirdly, in the rent reduction, no attention was paid to reasoning and legal struggles, but "struggle by force" was advocated, resulting in serious phenomena of arbitrary arrests, beatings, detentions, killings, and confiscations, causing chaos in some rural areas. In addition, there was a tendency of formalism in the organizational work of the farmers' association; there was also a tendency of emphasizing quantity over quality in the development of the militia.
    The report pointed out that the reasons for the above-mentioned deviations, from the inspection of the leadership ideology and work style of the prefectural committee, are mainly due to: (1) The prefectural committee has left-leaning ideology and impetuous emotions. Subjectively, it originally wanted to do everything possible to solve the difficulties of the masses, but because of the influence of left-leaning thinking and impetuous emotions, it could not correctly divide the policy boundaries, nor could it grasp the specific steps of the work. For example, on the issue of rent refund, the Guibei Regional Committee only instructed to refund the rent, but the prefectural committee added interest refund, which exceeded the policy scope stipulated by the Regional Committee; on the issue of anti-hegemony, because the prefectural committee's definition of bullies was not clear, it divided bullies into "bullies who undermine reasonable burdens," "bullies who seriously embezzle," "bullies who collude with bandits," and "landlord power factions." As a result, some areas in Rong County saw the phenomenon of "political bullies," "economic bullies," "big bullies," and "small bullies" being struggled against together. The left-leaning emotions in the leadership of the prefectural committee also fueled the development of left-leaning emotions among the cadres below. (2) There is a bureaucratic work style in the leadership of the prefectural committee, mainly manifested in insufficient understanding of the situation below, and the deployment of tasks starts from imagination. The deployment and leadership work are generally generalized, and it is not possible to focus on a central task in a period of time to give specific instructions and assistance to the lower levels. Insufficient careful research on the reports of various counties, and slow response to questions. More attention is paid to small problems, but big problems are ignored; at the same time, it is not good at discovering general problems from individual problems to guide the overall situation. (3) The ideological method is simple and one-sided, failing to grasp the center, and often neglecting one thing while taking care of another. For example, emphasizing grain requisitioning while neglecting bandit suppression; emphasizing letting go while neglecting strengthening leadership; opposing boundless leniency in bandit suppression while neglecting preventing and stopping indiscriminate beatings and killings. Lacking in-depth research on problems, and accustomed to using simplified methods to deal with complex work problems.
    After inspecting the leadership style, the report pointed out that it is necessary to accept past experiences and lessons, and strengthen the leadership of the current main work (bandit suppression). In the difficult situation of few and weak cadres, many work tasks, scattered rural areas, and inconvenient transportation, it is even more necessary to firmly grasp the leadership of the central work in order to promote secondary work and resolve the contradiction between key leadership and comprehensive care. It is necessary to strengthen unified leadership. Party committees, various departments, the army and the local government should unify their steps, clearly divide their labor according to tasks, and each have their own responsibilities and closely cooperate. While opposing "left," we must also pay attention to preventing right deviation to ensure the correct policy. Finally, the report proposed that leadership should be checked regularly in the future, and the prefectural committee is prepared to conduct self-criticism to the people at any time through newspapers.

　　广西柳州地委整风会议中
    检讨左倾思想急躁情绪
    确定今后要统一步调加强剿匪领导
    【本报讯】中共广西柳州地委会于七月十一日召开整风会议，总结检查地委一级的领导工作。出席各县县委书记等干部三十九人。会议中地委书记李一平首先对八个月来的工作及地委领导思想作风作了总结检查报告。报告首先指出该地委区八个月来的工作，在剿匪、减租退租运动、征粮等主要工作方面，均获得了相当成绩。八个月来，共歼匪一一、二四六名，经过减租退租运动的地区，农民共得果实粮五百七十余万斤，春耕困难得到基本解决，胜利度过夏荒，生产情绪提高，新开荒地二万四千余亩。但在执行各项主要政策中，发生了许多严重的错误和缺点。首先是地委对剿匪领导不够重视。某些地区的部队尚未树立地方化的思想，未能很好发动群众，开展群众性的剿匪运动，忽视了政治攻势，因而使匪患仍严重存在。其次，在各项农村工作中对中农团结不够。有的地区侵犯了中农利益，引起中农不安不满。如有的地方规定中农参加农会，要有三个月的候补期；借粮中动了中农甚至动了个别贫农。再次是在减租中不重视说理合法斗争，而提倡“斗力”，致发生了乱捕、乱打、乱押、乱杀、乱没收的严重现象，造成了农村中某些地方的混乱。此外，在农会的组织工作中，有形式主义的偏向；发展民兵中也存在着重量不重质的偏向。
    报告指出，发生以上偏向的原因，从地委的领导思想和作风来检查，主要由于：（一）地委有左倾思想和急躁情绪。主观上原想想尽一切办法去解决群众的困难，但因为左的思想与急躁情绪的影响，不能正确地划分政策界限，也不能掌握工作的具体步骤。如在退租问题上，桂北区党委只指示退租，地委却加上了退息，超出了区党委规定的政策范围；在反霸问题上，因地委对恶霸的定义规定不明确，而将恶霸分成“破坏合理负担之霸”、“严重贪污之霸”、“通匪之霸”、“地主当权派”等。致融县某些地区发生了“政治霸”、“经济霸”、“大霸”、“小霸”一齐斗争的现象。地委领导上的左倾情绪，又助长了下面干部左倾情绪的发展。（二）地委领导上存在着官僚主义作风，主要表现对下面情况了解不够，布置任务从想像出发。布置与领导工作一般化，不能在一个时期内围绕一个中心任务，给下面以具体的指示与帮助。对各县的报告慎重研究不够，回答问题迟缓。小问题抓得多，大问题反而忽略了；同时不善于从个别问题当中去发现一般问题以指导全面。（三）思想方法简单片面，抓不住中心，常常顾此失彼。如强调征粮，又忽视剿匪；强调放手，又忽视了加强领导；剿匪中反对宽大无边，又忽略了预防与制止乱打乱杀。对问题缺乏深入研究，习惯于用简单化的方法去处理复杂的工作问题。
    在检查领导作风后，报告指出必须接受以往的经验教训，加强对当前的主要工作（剿匪）的领导。在干部少而弱，工作任务多，农村分散，交通不便的困难情况下，更要抓紧中心工作的领导，以便推动次要工作，解决重点领导与全面照顾的矛盾。要加强统一领导，党委之间、各部门之间，军队与地方之间，应统一步调，按任务明确分工，各有专责，紧密配合。在反“左”时同时还要注意防右，保证端正政策。最后，报告提出以后要定期检查领导，地委并准备通过报纸，随时向人民群众作自我批评。
