　　State-run Jiheng Farm in Ji County Prepares a Gift for National Day
    Three-Gang Seeder Successfully Tested
    Sows Over Seven Hundred Mu Daily; Workers Call it the "Cow Killer"
    [Report from Jixian by this newspaper] The state-run Jiheng Farm in Hebei Province currently cultivates 17,000 mu of land and plans to sow 13,000 mu with wheat, reserving the remainder for winter plowing to weather and improve the alkaline soil. The farm cherishes national assets and meticulously researches ways to save money and expand economic construction. The successful testing of the three-gang seeder is presented as a gift for National Day.
    After the farm's labor union was established in August, the comrades of the labor committee frequently discussed how to save national assets and expand the scope of economic construction. Last year, when the farm planted wheat, it used an American Ford tractor to pull only one seeder. This year, it was decided to use a Soviet ATZ tractor to pull two seeders. However, after research by technician Zhou Muxian, it was determined that three seeders could be pulled. Technician Zhou contacted the Northeast August 15th Farm and the Central Agricultural Department for information and, drawing on experience and combining it with his own work experience, experimented with this setup. The experiment was finally successful on September 12th. This three-gang machine is 32 feet wide and can sow 36 rows. It began working in the Nanliangzhuang area on the 12th. According to statistics from the 15th, it can sow 65 Chinese mu per hour, working 12 hours a day, sowing 780 mu; the average consumption of kerosene per mu is four liang and three qian. In contrast, the American seeder pulled by an American Ford tractor is only 11 feet wide and can sow 12 rows, sowing 11.5 mu per hour, with a maximum daily sowing of 138 mu; the consumption of gasoline per mu is three liang and one qian (equivalent to six liang and two qian of kerosene). Therefore, in terms of sowing efficiency, the Soviet three-gang seeder sows 642 mu more per day than the American single seeder; saving one liang and nine qian of kerosene per mu. The farm used the three-gang seeder to sow 10,000 mu, saving a total of 19,000 jin of kerosene, equivalent to 57,000 jin of millet; at 800 yuan per jin of millet, the total savings is 45.6 million RMB. In addition, the connecting rod of the three-gang seeder can also connect five harrows for harrowing the land, with a width of 32 feet, and can also carry three rollers at the rear. This has been successfully tested in the Second Work Team, and over 4,000 mu have been harrowed in four days. The masses were very surprised to see the three-gang seeder, saying, "Wow! Such a big guy, with such a machine, there's no need to worry about tens of hectares of land." So the workers of the whole farm gave it a title called "Cow Killer".

　　国营冀衡农场为国庆准备献礼
    三连播种机试验成功
    每天播种七百余亩工人叫它是“气死牛”
    【本报冀县讯】河北省国营冀衡农场，现种地一万七千亩，准备种麦一万三千亩，其余留作冬耕风化改良碱性。该场为爱护国家资财经细心钻研，将三连播种机试验成功作为对国庆日的献礼。
    该场工会于八月份建立后，工委同志们就经常研究如何节省国家资财扩大经济建设范围，该场去年种麦时，用一部美式福特拖拉机只拉一部播种机；今年决定采用一部苏式阿特兹拖拉机可拉两部播种机。但后经周慕贤技师研究结果，认为可拉三部播种机，经周技师与东北八一五农场、中央农业部分头去信联系，吸取经验，结合个人工作经验试验此种装置，至九月十二日终于试验成功。此三连机共三十二尺宽，能播种三十六行。十二号于南良庄区开始工作，据十五号统计：每小时能播种六十五华亩，每天工作十二小时，播种七百八十亩；每亩平均消耗煤油四两三钱。而美式福特拖拉机拖引的美式播种机仅宽十一尺，能播种十二行，每小时播种十一亩半，每天最高播种一百三十八亩；每亩消耗汽油三两一钱（合煤油六两二钱）。故在播种效率上苏式三连播种机比美式单播种机每天多播种六百四十二亩；每亩节省煤油一两九钱。全场用三连播种机播种了一万亩，共节省煤油一万九千斤，共节省折小米五万七千斤；每斤小米按八百元计算，共节省人民币四千五百六十万元。此外用三连播种机的连接杆还可连接五个耙地的耙，宽三十二尺，后边还可带三个耲。已在第二工作队试验成功，四天内已耙地四千多亩。群众见了三连播种机很惊奇的说：“哈！这么大家伙，有了这样的机器，有几十顷地也不发愁。”所以全场的工人们给了它一个称号叫做“气死牛”。
