　　New Era Magazine Editorial on the Fifth Anniversary of the Surrender of Japanese Imperialism
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, August 31st, TASS dispatch: The New Era magazine recently published an editorial entitled: "Fifth Anniversary of the Surrender of Japanese Imperialism." The editorial stated: As the fifth anniversary of the defeat and surrender of Japanese imperialism arrives, it is precisely when the sinister and predatory nature of the American policy towards the peoples of Asia is particularly blatant. From the fact that the United States is using Japan as a base to carry out aggression against the Korean people, we can see what kind of role Washington has been constantly preparing Japan to play in recent years.
    The American occupation authorities in Tokyo, adopting the same methods as those used in West Germany, evaded fulfilling the international obligations assumed by the United States. They sabotaged the work of the Allied Council for Japan and limited the activities of the Far Eastern Commission to mere formality, thereby paralyzing the work of this commission. It has been apparent for a long time that Washington's politicians were secretly undermining the preparations for a peace treaty with Japan.
    The American policy towards Japan aims to fascisize the country and make it a colony and a base for new aggressive adventures. American imperialism has in fact declared itself the successor to Japanese imperialism and has now begun to enslave many countries in the Far East.
    American imperialism has turned the Japanese islands into an outpost for aggression against the people of Asia. American troops are stationed in this country, airfields for bombers have been established, and naval bases have been modernized and expanded as strongholds to support the American navy. MacArthur has retained the Japanese military cadres because he wants to make Japan the Asian gendarme under American control. Japanese air force personnel are now working with the American air force in Korea, engaging in devastation and destruction. The Tokyo authorities have closely colluded with the Kuomintang clique that retreated to Taiwan.
    The American armed aggression against Korea clearly shows that the people of Asia have encountered a new enemy in American imperialism, whose insidious and vicious nature even exceeds that of imperial Japan.
    The intervention in Korea is the first step in the armed struggle waged by the American imperialist provocateurs against the national liberation movement of the Asian people, which the imperialists fear most. The barbaric means employed in the intervention have demonstrated that the purpose of American imperialism is to intimidate the whole of Asia. But American imperialism has miscalculated. The heroic struggle of the Korean people has shattered the plans of the aggressors, because this struggle proves that the era in which the imperialists could unscrupulously plunder and ravage Asia is gone forever.
    The editorial concluded: The fifth anniversary of the defeat and surrender of Japanese imperialism brings a new and powerful reminder: only the decisive strength of the Soviet Union in the war in the East guaranteed victory. In the post-war years, the entire policy of the Soviet Union demonstrates that the Soviet Union has always been a friend and protector of Asian countries, and Asian countries have also realized their own vital interests and know that they have the strength to defend these interests.

### 日本帝国主义投降五周年

　　日本帝国主义投降五周年
    新时代杂志社论
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八月三十一日讯：新时代杂志顷发表一篇社论，题为：《日本帝国主义投降五周年》。社论称：当日本帝国主义失败与投降五周年到来之际，正是美国对亚洲各族人民的政策的罪恶与掳掠性质表现得特别露骨的时候。从美国以日本为基地进行对朝鲜人民的侵略的事实中，我们可以看出华盛顿这几年来不断准备使日本担任什么样的一个角色。
    美国驻东京的占领当局采用了像在西德所采用的同样办法，逃避履行美国所担负的国际义务。他们破坏了盟国对日委员会的工作，并使远东委员会的活动仅限于形式，从而瘫痪了这个委员会的工作。很久以前就可以明显地看出，华盛顿的政客们是在暗中破坏对日和约的准备工作。
    美国所推行的对日政策，旨在把这个国家法西斯化，并使其成为殖民地与新的侵略性冒险行动的基地。美国帝国主义事实上已宣布它为日本帝国主义的继承人，现在已着手奴役远东的许多国家。
    美国帝国主义已把日本各岛变为侵略亚洲人民的前哨。美国军队驻扎在这个国家，供轰炸机使用的飞机场已经建立起来，海军基地业已近代化，并予以扩充，作为支援美国海军的据点。麦克阿瑟把日本军事干部保留下来，因为他要使日本成为美国控制下的亚洲宪兵。日本的空军人员现在已经与美国的空军人员一起在朝鲜从事蹂躏与破坏。东京当局已与退守台湾的国民党集团密切勾结。
    美国武装侵略朝鲜很明显地说明：亚洲人民碰到了美帝国主义这个新的敌人，其阴险毒辣的程度甚至超过帝国的日本。
    对朝鲜的干涉是美帝国主义挑拨者用来对抗帝国主义者所最怕的亚洲人民民族解放运动所进行的武装斗争的第一步。在干涉中所从事的野蛮手段，已说明美帝国主义的目的在于恐吓整个亚洲。但是美国帝国主义已经估计错了。朝鲜人民的英勇斗争已经打破了侵略者的计划，因为这个斗争证明：帝国主义者能够肆无忌惮地掳掠与蹂躏亚洲的时代，已经一去不复返了。
    社论结语称：日本帝国主义失败与投降的五周年，给人们带来了一个新的、有力的回忆：只有苏联在东方作战中的决定性力量，才保证了胜利。在战后几年中，苏联的整个政策说明苏联始终是亚洲各国的友人与保护者，而亚洲各国也了解到它们的切身利益，并且知道它们有力量来维护这些利益。
