　　Is the Sun a Star or a Planet?
　　Answering a Question from Comrade Xiang Chen

　　Editor Comrades:
　　In our teaching, we have debated the question "Is the sun a star or a planet?" for a long time, but we have not been able to get a definite answer. We are writing to you to ask you to find a way to solve this problem.

　　Second High School, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, Niu Xiangchen

　　Comrade Xiang Chen:
　　Your question has been answered by the Astronomy Group of the Central People's Science Museum as follows:

　　The naming of planets and stars is because the positions of some stars in the sky are constantly moving, but the relative positions of other stars remain unchanged. Therefore, those stars that emit heat and light and whose positions appear unchanged over decades are called "stars"; those stars whose positions can be seen to move in a few days or a month or two and do not emit heat and light themselves are called "planets." The sun being recognized as a star and the earth being recognized as a planet happened in the second half of the sixteenth century. Before that, everyone thought that the sun, moon, and stars revolved around the earth, and religious figures even insisted that the earth was the center of all things.

　　Now, with the progress of astronomy, it is known that all celestial bodies are in motion. The stars that we used to think were stationary, including the sun, are also moving extremely fast, but they are too far away from us, and no change is apparent in a short period of decades.

　　The reason why the term star is still used is because it has been in common use for a long time, and if the explanation is not clear, it will make it difficult for beginners to understand. Moreover, saying that it is a star in a few decades will not have a significant impact, because their positional movement appears to be too small.

### 太阳是恒星还是行星？  答读者向辰同志问

　　太阳是恒星还是行星？
    答读者向辰同志问编者同志：
    我们在教学中，曾对“太阳是恒星还是行星？”这个问题争辩了好久，都得不到一个确切的答复，特请你设法解决这个问题。
      山西壶关县第二高校  牛向辰向辰同志：
    你的问题已由中央人民科学馆天文小组答复如下：
    行星和恒星的定名，是因为天上有几颗星的位置时常在移动，可是其他星星的相对位置却始终不变，于是便把那些发热发光在几十年内看起来位置不变的星星叫做“恒星”；那些几天或一两个月中就可以看出它位置的移动、自己不会发热发光的星星叫做“行星”。太阳之被认做恒星，和地球之被认为行星，是十六世纪下半叶的事。在这以前，大家以为日月星辰绕着地球转，宗教家更坚持地球是万物中心的说法。
    现在天文学的进步，知道了所有的星体都在运动，从前我们认为不动的恒星，连太阳在内，也是在极快的运动着，只是它们离我们太远，短短的几十年中显不出什么变动来。
    现在之所以仍沿用恒星这个名词，因为习用已久，解释不清楚时，反使初学者不易理解。而且在几十年中说它是恒星，不会有太大的影响，因为它们位置的移动看来是太少了。
