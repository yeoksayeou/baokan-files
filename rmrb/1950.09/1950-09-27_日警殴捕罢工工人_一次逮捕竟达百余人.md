    One Instance Leads to Over One Hundred Arrests
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 25th] According to International News Service, Tokyo: On the 21st, one thousand Japanese armed police, equipped with armored vehicles, and two hundred helmeted police officers attacked one thousand striking workers at the Fuji Industries Company factory in Mitaka, a suburb of Tokyo, forcibly driving the workers out of the factory. The police's brutal attack was met with fierce resistance from the workers. The police barbarously arrested sixty-five workers and injured twenty-four, four of whom were seriously injured. Afterwards, the striking workers, undeterred by being violently expelled from the factory, gathered again to demonstrate in front of the police station, demanding the release of the innocent workers who had been arrested. The police once again acted ferociously, arresting another thirty-eight people.
