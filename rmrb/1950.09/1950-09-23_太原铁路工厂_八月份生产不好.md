Taiyuan Railway Factory

	Poor Production in August

[This newspaper's Taiyuan dispatch] The Taiyuan Railway Factory did not fulfill its task in August. This was mainly due to unrealistic planning and leaders failing to understand the situation at lower levels, simply assigning tasks. In August, the factory completed 36.7% of the planned major overhaul of locomotives, 9.3% of passenger cars, and 26.7% of freight cars. In addition, items such as cast iron, cast copper, and locomotive, passenger, and freight car wheels were far from meeting the targets. At the same time, many locomotives and vehicles, although repaired, could not leave the factory because they did not meet standards, resulting in serious waste from rework. Although the failure to supply some materials in a timely manner affected the progress of production, the main reason was that the leadership did not go deep into the field, the planning was not thorough, and there was a lack of foresight. They simply assigned tasks to the lower levels and failed to solve difficulties in a timely manner, which prevented the workers from improving their work enthusiasm, resulting in losses in the overall work.

### 太原铁路工厂  八月份生产不好

    八月份生产不好
    【本报太原讯】太原铁路工厂八月份没有完成任务，这主要是计划不切合实际，领导干部不问下情，单纯布置任务的结果。八月份该厂机车折合大修完成部定任务的百分之三六·七；客车折合大修完成百分之九·三；货车折合大修完成百分之二六·七；此外铸铁、铸铜、机、客、货车轮等项都与任务距离很远，同时还有许多机车车辆虽已修好，但因不合标准而不能出厂，造成反工、反活的严重浪费。这虽然由于有些材料未能及时供给，影响了生产工作的进行；但主要是领导上没有深入现场，计划不周，加之预见性不够，总是单纯的向下面布置任务，不能及时的给下面解决困难，致使工友们工作情绪不能提高，因而在整个工作上受到了损失。
