Introduction to the World Federation of Democratic Youth

　　In November 1942, youth representatives from twenty-nine countries established an anti-fascist international youth organization in London - the World Youth Council. Its main task was to inspire and support young people around the world in striving for victory in the anti-fascist war. In November 1945, the World Youth Council convened the World Youth Congress in London. The congress was attended by approximately 600 representatives, representing 30 million organized young people from 64 countries. The meeting decided to establish the World Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDF) and adopted the charter of the WFDF.

　　The World Federation of Democratic Youth aims to unite democratic youth around the world, defend lasting world peace, strive for democracy and national independence, and fight for the rights and a better future for young people. The action program of the WFDF conforms to the hopes and interests of the vast majority of young people, and therefore unites millions of young men and women around the world.

　　In recent years, the central task of the WFDF has been to unite young people around the world to defend peace. Since its establishment, it has called for the elimination of fascist remnants, constantly criticized warmongers, exposed the conspiracy of imperialism to prepare for war, and called on young people to defend peace with action. For the Greek and Spanish youth who persisted in fighting against fascism, the WFDF has continuously called on its member organizations to provide various assistance. Under the promotion of the WFDF, young people in Western Europe and other countries launched a movement against the North Atlantic Treaty, opposed compulsory military service and the extension of military service limits, and demanded a reduction in military budgets. In addition, through various youth festivals, the WFDF has mobilized a large number of young people to actively participate in the struggle for peace. At the World Peace Congress held in Paris and Prague in April 1949, 194 youth representatives representing 50 million young people from 46 countries attended and participated. In the past few months, under the call of the WFDF, young people around the world have participated in and promoted the peace signature movement with amazing achievements. Despite the fact that the running dogs of imperialism - the right-wing elements of the Social Democratic Party and the Tito spies - have been constantly carrying out divisive activities in the youth ranks, the democratic youth all over the world have strengthened and consolidated their ranks through various activities led by the WFDF, such as the World Youth Festivals in 1947 and 1949 and the organization of youth construction teams and mutual delegation of representatives, and concentratedly demonstrated their firm will to defend lasting world peace. Recently, the WFDF called on democratic youth organizations all over the world to resolutely demand the cessation of the American aggression against Korea, actively support the struggle of Korean youth, and further expand and intensify the movement to strive for peace.

　　The WFDF has always supported the struggle of youth in colonies and dependent countries against imperialism and for national liberation. It sent delegations to visit Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America in 1946 and 1948 to understand the situation of youth in the colonies. In February 1948, the WFDF and the International Student Union jointly convened the Southeast Asian Youth Conference, pointing out the importance of strengthening the unity of Southeast Asian youth. In April of the same year, the Latin American Democratic Youth Congress was held in Mexico. In addition, the "Department for Fighting Youth Against Colonialism" was established in the headquarters of the WFDF, and February 21 was designated as "Day for the Struggle Against Colonialism" every year.

　　In view of the increasingly frantic war preparations of the imperialists, which directly threatened the interests and lives of young people, especially young workers, in capitalist and colonial countries, the WFDF convened the World Youth Workers Conference in Warsaw in August 1948. The meeting put forward a plan to protect the rights of young workers, calling for strengthening the connection between youth organizations and trade unions. In addition, the WFDF has called on young people from all countries to support the large-scale strike movements that have broken out in France, Italy, Canada and other countries since 1947 in the spirit of international solidarity. It has also repeatedly supported the struggles of democratic youth organizations in various places, especially the leaders of democratic organizations who have been persecuted for carrying out activities to strive for peace, democratic rights and workers' demands.

　　The highest authority of the WFDF is the World Congress of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which is convened every three years. The highest authority during the adjournment of the congress is the Council elected by the Congress. The Council produces the Executive Committee, which executes the resolutions of the Council during the annual adjournment of the Council. The headquarters of the WFDF is located in Paris, and the current chairman is Bouésson (France), and the vice-chairmen are from the Soviet Union, China, the United States, Britain, the Czech Republic, and India.

　　In recent years, the WFDF has consistently maintained close cooperation and contact with international democratic organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Women's Federation, and the International Student Union in the movement to defend world peace. The ranks of the WFDF have been expanded and consolidated in such international unity and continuous struggle. In 1945, the total number of WFDF members was 30 million, and it has now increased to nearly 70 million.

　　At the second executive committee meeting of the WFDF in Berlin in late May this year, the resolution of the executive committee emphasized that the central task of the WFDF in the future is to: mobilize the peace-loving youth around the world as widely as possible to actively participate in the struggle to defend lasting world peace, and consolidate and strengthen the friendship and unity of democratic youth around the world in the common struggle for lasting peace, democracy, national independence, and the bright future of young people.

　　Today, the WFDF has become an important force in the world peace movement.

　　世界民主青年联盟介绍
    一九四二年十一月，二十九个国家青年代表在伦敦建立了一个反法西斯的国际青年组织——世界青年协会。它的主要任务是鼓舞和支援全世界青年争取反法西斯战争的胜利。一九四五年十一月，世界青年协会在伦敦召开了世界青年代表大会，大会共到代表约六百人，代表着六十四个国家的三千万有组织的青年群众。会上决定成立世界民主青年联盟（简称世界青联），通过了世界青联的会章。
    世界民主青年联盟以团结全世界民主青年，为保卫世界持久和平、争取民主和民族独立，争取青年的权利与美好的将来，作为斗争的目标。世界青联的这种行动纲领符合最广大青年的希望和利益，因而在它的周围团结了全世界千百万的青年男女。
    几年来，世界青联的中心工作是团结全世界青年保卫和平。它从成立时起，就要求消灭法西斯残余，不断地指责战争贩子、揭露帝国主义准备战争的阴谋，号召青年用行动保卫和平。对于坚持反法西斯的希腊和西班牙青年，世界青联曾不断地号召各会员团体给予各种援助。在世界青联的推动下，西欧等国青年展开反对北大西洋公约的运动，反对强迫兵役与延长兵役限期，和要求减缩军事预算的行动。此外，通过各项青年节日，世界青联曾动员广大青年积极进行争取和平的斗争。一九四九年四月在巴黎和布拉格分别举行的世界保卫和平大会上，就有一百九十四名青年代表着四十六个国家的五千万青年出席参加。几个月来，在世界青联号召下，全世界青年更以惊人的成绩参加与推动着和平签名运动。尽管帝国主义的走狗们——社会民主党右翼分子与铁托奸细——不断地在青年队伍中进行分裂活动，但是，全世界民主青年通过世界青联领导的各项活动，如一九四七和四九年世界青年联欢节以及青年建设队的组织与互派代表团等，日益壮大并且巩固了自己的队伍，并且集中地表现了他们对保卫世界持久和平的坚决意志。最近，世界青联号召全世界民主青年组织，坚决要求制止美国侵略朝鲜的行动，积极支援朝鲜青年的斗争，并进而扩大和加紧进行争取和平的运动。
    世界青联一直支持殖民地、附属国家青年反对帝国主义，争取民族解放的斗争。它曾在一九四六及四八年先后派遣考察团访问东南亚、中东、非洲及拉丁美洲等国家，了解殖民地青年的情况。一九四八年二月，世界青联与国际学联共同召开了东南亚青年大会，指出东南亚青年加强团结的重要性。同年四月又在墨西哥召开了拉丁美洲民主青年代表大会。此外，在世界青联总部内设立了“反对殖民制度战斗青年部”，并规定每年二月二十一日为“反对殖民制度斗争日”。
    鉴于帝国主义者日益疯狂的备战活动，直接威胁了资本主义与殖民地国家的青年尤其是青年工人的利益和生活，世界青联在一九四八年八月在华沙召开世界青年工人大会。会上提出保护青年工人的权利的方案，要求加强青年组织与职工会的连系。此外，世界青联曾号召各国青年以国际团结的精神，支持一九四七年以来在法、意、加拿大等国家爆发的大规模罢工运动。又曾多次支援各地民主青年组织的斗争，特别是那些为进行争取和平、民主权利和工人的要求的活动而遭受迫害的民主组织的领袖们。
    世界青联的最高权力机构是每三年召开一次的世界民主青年联盟代表大会，大会闭幕期间的最高权力机构是由大会选出的理事会。理事会产生执行委员会，在一年一度的理事会闭幕期间执行理事会的决议。世界青联总部设在巴黎，现任主席为鲍埃逊（法），副主席由苏、中、美、英、捷克及印度担任。
    几年来，世界青联与世界工联，国际妇联，国际学联等国际性民主组织，在保卫世界和平的运动中，一贯地保持了密切的合作与联系。世界青联的队伍就是在这样的国际团结以及不断的斗争中扩大和巩固起来的。一九四五年世界青联会员人数总共是三千万，目前已增加到近七千万。
    今年五月底，世界青联在柏林召开了一九五○年度第二次执委会，在执委会的决议中强调指出了今后世界青联的中心任务是要：尽量广泛地动员全世界爱好和平的青年，积极参加保卫世界持久和平的斗争，并且在争取持久和平、民主、各民族独立以及青年的美好的将来的共同斗争中，巩固并加强全世界民主青年的友谊和团结。
    今天，世界青联已成为世界保卫和平运动中一支重要的力量。
