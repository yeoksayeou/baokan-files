    To Congratulate Hero and Model Worker Representatives Conference
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions sent a telegram to all representatives of the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference and the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives Conference to congratulate them.

    We, on behalf of all workers, technicians, and staff members in the Northeast, warmly congratulate you—the glorious combat hero representatives who have made outstanding contributions in the great People's Liberation War—on your grand gathering in our country's capital. And we extend to you our revolutionary salute!
    Due to the great victory of the People's Liberation War, we are able to focus on our country's economic construction. We will exert high labor enthusiasm to accelerate our country's industrialization construction work to support you, to thoroughly eliminate the remaining Chiang bandits, liberate Taiwan and Tibet, crush the provocations of American imperialist aggression, defend the motherland's borders, and defend economic construction.
    Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, September 22nd To the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, forwarded to all representatives of the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives Conference:
    We congratulate the grand opening of the conference with joy and excitement. Outstanding labor models from all over the country have gathered in our country's capital to hold an unprecedented grand meeting, demonstrating that the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, have achieved great military victories and have also achieved great victories on our country's economic construction front.
    All the staff and workers in our Northeast eagerly look forward to the conference bringing us extremely valuable production experience, so that we can better accomplish the glorious and arduous task of building the Northeast into a national industrial base. Currently, we are intensively launching a production competition to welcome National Day and the first National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives Conference, and to actively prepare forces with this practical action to crush the provocative acts of American imperialism's aggression against our country!
    Finally, on behalf of all the staff and workers in the entire Northeast, we extend our highest respect to you—the models of the glorious working people! We wish you good health! We wish you to create even greater achievements in future production and construction work.
              Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, September 22nd
