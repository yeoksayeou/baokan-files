　　Major Public Hospitals in Beijing and Tianjin
    Conduct Comprehensive Inspections and Summaries
    Improvements Made in Hospital Work After Inspections
    [Our Dispatch] Reporter Zhu Bo reports: Major public hospitals in Beijing and Tianjin have successively carried out inspection and summary work. From February 6th to March 21st, the Beijing Municipal People's Government organized an inspection of the Third Municipal Hospital. The Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government conducted an inspection of the North China People's Hospital in March. From mid-April to mid-May, the People's Supervision Committee organized an inspection of the Railway Hospital. From mid-June to the end of July, Peking University Hospital conducted a comprehensive work inspection and summary of its own. The Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau began inspecting the Third and Fourth Municipal Hospitals in February. The results of the inspections showed that the work of the aforementioned hospitals had improved considerably over the past year since liberation. Peking University Hospital, in particular, had made remarkable achievements in professional work and cadre training. However, all hospitals still retained, to varying degrees, old medical practices and lacked a highly responsible spirit of serving patients. For example, a doctor at the Railway Hospital performed an operation on a worker from the Tianjin Inspection Section without careful consideration, and then did not order him to be hospitalized, resulting in the patient fainting on the way home. The hospital casually allowed an intern to perform surgery on a parturient, Kang Yunfeng, resulting in a broken needle being left in the perineum, which could not be found for an hour. The attending physician was not seen for three days after the operation, resulting in inflammation and suppuration of the incision. The hospital often made mistakes in giving injections and dispensing medicine. The surgery department of the Third Municipal Hospital of Beijing had an 18 percent suppuration rate in 22 cases of small bowel hernia surgery, but never studied methods to prevent suppuration. A wounded soldier with a ruptured popliteal artery was admitted to the North China People's Hospital, but the operation was not performed until four hours later. Due to careless disinfection, the blood vessels were not sutured properly, and the patient died thirty hours after the operation. Readers of this newspaper have criticized other irresponsible medical practices at the hospital in the People's Forum.
    Due to poor management, many medical equipment and supplies in these hospitals suffered unnecessary losses. Many warehouses had not been inventoried. For example, the North China People's Hospital originally had a lot of equipment, but it was not found, and another 100,000 jin of millet were spent to buy new ones. Many valuable medicines in the hospital's warehouse were damaged due to poor storage. Many valuable pieces of equipment were stolen and sold at the Third Municipal Hospital of Beijing. The Third Municipal Hospital of Tianjin did not have clear regulations. The families of the hospital's employees did not pay for medicine, which affected the hospital's funding.
    The main reason for these shortcomings was the existence of bureaucratic work styles in the leadership. Many leading comrades did not understand the situation in depth and buried themselves in the office all day long. The leading comrades of each hospital paid little attention to the ideological and political education of medical personnel. The general medical personnel lacked the concept of serving the people. Many people worked to earn millet, did not seek progress, engaged in sectarianism, and were not united. For example, the doctors at the Third Municipal Hospital of Beijing were divided into "German-Japanese" and "British-American" factions, and the nurses were divided into "Tongren" and "Shanxi" factions, etc., who looked down on each other and attacked each other, forming a disconnect between superiors and subordinates and between departments. Secondly, the hospitals did not establish scientific systems, and even if there were some systems, they were not well implemented. The chaotic phenomenon of "unclear responsibilities and unclear division of labor" was quite common.
    After the inspections, the work in all aspects of the hospitals and the ideological style of the medical personnel have been improved or are beginning to be improved. The hospitals have discussed improvement methods and plans for future work. For example, the North China People's Hospital will open a joint clinic in the city to facilitate patients in the city, and has organized a hospital affairs committee with patient participation to implement democratic management and establish a work inspection system. In addition to handling and correcting the problems found, the Third Municipal Hospital of Beijing has also stipulated that it will strengthen the ideological education of medical personnel in the future in order to change the medical style of medical personnel. After the inspection, the hospital has made many improvements in its work. For example, the internal medicine outpatient department has automatically expanded two outpatient rooms to reduce the waiting time for patients. No cases of suppuration after surgery have occurred in the past two months, and many new work systems have been established. In addition, it is also planned to add medical personnel and medical equipment. The originally better Peking University Hospital has further improved the political consciousness of its staff after the inspection, and the concept of "serving patients" has become clearer. The hospital's nutrition department has come up with ways to improve the diet of patients. When the Fuhua Firecracker Factory explosion occurred, the hospital staff went to rescue the injured citizens with selfless spirit. They also automatically organized a blood transfusion team to rescue the injured citizens. The inspection and summary work of these hospitals have achieved certain results, enabling their staff to improve their thinking and work, creating good conditions for further improving their work.

　　京津各主要公立医院
    全面检查和总结工作
    检查以后各医院工作都有改进
    【本报讯】记者朱波报道：京津各主要公立医院先后进行了检查和总结工作。北京市人民政府从二月六日至三月二十一日组织了对市立第三医院的检查。中央人民政府卫生部于三月份对华北人民医院进行了检查。人民监察委员会从四月中旬至五月中旬，组织了铁路医院的检查。北大医院自六月中旬至七月底，自己进行了全面的工作检查与总结。天津市人民政府卫生局从二月开始，分别对市立第三、第四医院进行了检查。检查的结果说明了解放一年来上述医院的工作都有相当改进，特别是北京北大医院，在业务工作及培养干部方面都有显著的成绩。但各医院仍然或多或少地保留着旧医疗作风，缺乏为病人服务的高度负责精神。如铁路医院某大夫，未经考虑成熟，就给天津检车段一工人动手术，动了手术后又不叫住院，结果使病人晕倒途中。该院随便让一实习大夫给产妇康云凤动手术，结果将缝针折断于会阴部，一个钟头时间未能把针找出。动手术后三天不见主治大夫，结果刀口发炎化脓。该院常常发生打错针拿错药的事情。北京市立第三医院外科，在二十二例小肠疝手术中，有百分之十八化了脓，但从不研究防止化脓的方法。一位伤员腘动脉破裂出血不止，但入华北人民医院后四个钟头才动手术，由于消毒不认真，血管没有缝好，病人在动手术后三十小时死亡。该院在医疗上其他不负责任的现象，本报读者曾在人民园地上批评过。
    这些医院，由于管理不善，很多医药器材遭受了不应有的损失。很多库房都没有清点。如华北人民医院，原来就有很多器材，但居然没有发现，又花费十万斤小米去买新的。该院仓库里不少贵重药品因为保管不善，都损坏了。北京市立第三医院很多贵重器材被盗卖了。天津市立第三医院没有明确的制度，该院员工家属吃药都不出药钱，影响医院的经费。
    产生这些缺点的主要原因是由于领导上存在着官僚主义作风。很多领导同志不深入了解情况，终日埋头在办公室里。各医院领导同志很少注意医务人员的思想教育、政治教育，一般医务人员缺乏为人民服务的观念，不少人为挣小米而工作，不求进步，闹宗派，不团结。如北京市立第三医院的医生分为“德日”派、“英美”派，护士分为“同仁”、“山西”等派，谁也瞧不起谁，互相攻击，形成上下级之间、部门之间脱节的现象。其次，各医院没有建立科学的制度，有了若干制度，也没有很好执行。相当普遍地存在着“职责不清、分工不明”的混乱现象。
    各医院经过检查后，各方面工作及医务人员的思想作风都有了改进或正在开始改进。各医院都讨论了改进的办法及今后工作的计划。如华北人民医院要在城内开设联合门诊部，以便利城内病人，并组织了有病人参加的院务委员会，实行民主管理，建立检查工作制度。北京市立第三医院除将发现的问题分别处理与纠正外，并规定今后加强医务人员思想教育，以便改变医务人员医疗作风。该院经过检查后，工作上已有很多改进，如内科门诊为减少病人候诊时间自动扩大了两个门诊室，两个月来没有发生一个动手术后化脓的现象，并建立了许多新的工作制度。除此以外，还计划增添医务人员及医疗设备。原来比较好的北大医院经过检查后，工作人员的政治觉悟更提高了一步，“为病人服务”的观念更明确了。该院营养科已想出改进病人饮食的办法。辅华火药厂爆炸事件发生时，该院工作人员以忘我的精神前往抢救受伤的市民。他们并自动组织输血组救治受伤市民。这些医院的检查和总结工作都收到了一定的效果，使它们的工作人员在思想上和在工作上都提高了一步，为更进一步提高工作创造了良好的条件。
