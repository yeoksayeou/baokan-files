Xinhua News Agency, 21st—The North Atlantic Aggression Group's Council held its fifth meeting in New York on September 15th, 16th, and 18th, presided over by Council Chairman, US Secretary of State Acheson.

The United States' goal at this meeting was to further implement the plan established at the London meeting in May of this year, coercing its vassal states within the North Atlantic Group to rapidly establish a North Atlantic collective aggressor army under unified American command, with West German mercenaries as the backbone. Simultaneously, in order to supply this aggressor army, each country should accelerate and expand military production and military expenditures.

The original intention of the United States was to pass this plan by pressuring Britain and France into agreement at the preceding meeting of the three foreign ministers of the US, Britain, and France, and then submit it to the North Atlantic Council for routine approval. However, the result of the three foreign ministers' meeting was that, due to the stubborn resistance of Britain and France, the main parts of the American plan were not passed. Therefore, Acheson attempted to first force the North Atlantic Council to pass it, and then submit it to the three foreign ministers' meeting, which was postponed to the 18th for the closing session. However, Acheson encountered similar strong resistance at the Council meeting, and the meeting had to be extended beyond the original schedule. In the end, it still failed to achieve results on major issues. Therefore, the United States has had to decide to convene another Council meeting in New York within two weeks to resolve the issues unresolved at this meeting.

According to a United Press dispatch on the 15th, Acheson directly put forward a plan at the meeting, demanding that "Western European countries try to merge their respective armies into an international army. This plan requires the establishment of a supreme commander. This army will be equipped as quickly as possible." Acheson said, "There is no other way than to incorporate West German troops into the joint defense forces." The dispatch also stated: "Acheson has submitted the plan to the meeting for approval without any reservations." Acheson's attitude, according to the United Press, put "the Council in a showdown situation."

However, despite this, Acheson's plan was resisted by representatives of Western European governments who feared popular opposition. France was the first among them. According to Agence France-Presse, French Foreign Minister Schuman specifically "presented a program on the rearmament of Germany at the meeting on the 16th, which listed various reasons why the French government believed that it was too early to take any immediate decisions on this issue." Schuman stated clearly: "France has already adopted a clear position (i.e., expressed its opposition to the rearmament of Germany) on this issue before the French people and its allies, and therefore it is natural that France cannot immediately answer this serious question of principle." Schuman also expressed his melancholy, saying: "Taking any immediate decisions is dangerous because it is a complex issue fraught with serious consequences." Besides France and Britain, according to Reuters: "Other foreign ministers stated that although their own countries were not fundamentally opposed to Acheson's goals, it would be difficult to implement Acheson's suggestions. Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Norway all explained that, since these countries had been occupied, there were psychological and political problems in making the people accept the idea of ​​coexisting with the German army."

Schuman's confession and the "explanations" of other Western European foreign ministers fully exposed the deep fear of the US vassal states towards the power of the domestic people when implementing their master's aggression plans. It is precisely the power of the people of various countries that has prevented the passage of the American imperialist ambitious plan, not only at the meeting of the three foreign ministers, but also at the North Atlantic Treaty Council.

Since the issue of establishing a West German aggressor army was not passed, the meeting was unable to make the decision required by Acheson regarding the plan to establish a North Atlantic collective force. As for the issue of the selection of the commander of the collective force, it has been transferred to the Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting scheduled for October.

The United States has forced its vassal states at the meeting to agree mainly on military production. According to the US Information Service on the 17th: "The Council has passed a production plan with high priority, aimed at maximizing the use of existing production potential to produce military equipment, and has adopted a short-term financial plan to maintain this production." However, the financial problems faced by the entire North Atlantic Aggression Group in supporting long-term arms expansion and war preparation have not been resolved. The US Information Service quoted "official sources" on the 15th as saying: "It cannot be hoped that a conclusion on the issue of financial agreements for accelerating military production will be reached at this meeting. It may take weeks or even months to reach an agreement on the long-term aspects of this issue."

### 北大西洋侵略集团举行理事会议  暴露帝国主义内部矛盾  美胁迫仆从国建立侵略军计划遭遇各国抗拒  仆从国执行美侵略计划时深惧国内人民反对

　　北大西洋侵略集团举行理事会议
    暴露帝国主义内部矛盾
    美胁迫仆从国建立侵略军计划遭遇各国抗拒
    仆从国执行美侵略计划时深惧国内人民反对
    【新华社二十一日讯】北大西洋侵略集团理事会第五次会议已于九月十五、十六、十八三日由理事会主席美国国务卿艾奇逊主持，在纽约举行。
    美国在这次会议上的目的是要进一步实现今年五月伦敦会议上的已定计划，胁迫其在北大西洋集团内的仆从国家，迅速建立一支由美国人统一指挥，而由西德雇佣军充当骨干的北大西洋集体侵略军，同时为要供应这支侵略军，各国应加速并扩大军事生产与军费支出。
    美国本来的打算是在前此举行的美、英、法三外长会议上通过压迫英法同意这一计划，然后再提交北大西洋理事会作照例的批准。但是三外长会议的结果，由于英法的顽强抵抗，美国计划的主要部分，没有被通过，因此艾奇逊又企图先强迫北大西洋理事会通过，然后再提到延期至十八日举行结束会议的三外长会议上通过。但是艾奇逊在理事会上却同样遭到很大的抵抗，会议同样不得不超出原定的日程而延期，最后也还同样在主要问题上得不到结果。美国因此已不得不决定在两周以内即在纽约再度开理事会会议，以图解决这次会议上未解决的问题。
    据合众社十五日电称：艾奇逊在会上曾直截地提出一个计划，要求“西欧各国设法将各自的军队合并成为一支国际军。这项计划需要设立一个最高统帅。这支军队将尽速获得装备”。艾奇逊说，“除使西德军队加入联防军而外，别无其他办法”。该电并称：“艾奇逊已将计划提请会议批准，而毫无任何保留”。艾奇逊的这种态度，据合众社称：使“理事会面临一种摊牌的局面。”
    但是，虽然如此，艾奇逊的计划仍然受到因害怕人民反对的西欧各国政府代表的抗拒。其中首先就是法国。据法新社称：法国外长舒曼为此特在十六日会上“提出关于重新武装德国一项纲领，其中罗列法国政府所以认为目前立即对这问题采取任何决定皆嫌过早的种种理由”。舒曼明白声称：“法国关于这一问题事前既已在法国人民及各友邦面前，采取了明确的立场（即表示过不容德国重新武装），因而法国目前不能即时答复这一原则性的严重问题乃是当然的。”舒曼并忧郁地表示：“目前立即采取任何决定，都是危险的，因为这是一件孕育着种种严重后果的复杂问题。”除了法国和英国以外，据路透社称：“其他的外长都在声明中认为他们自己的国家虽然不是根本反对艾奇逊的目的，但是要把艾奇逊的建议付诸实施是困难的。比利时、荷兰、卢森堡与挪威都解释过，由于各该国曾作过被占领的国家，在使人民接受与德军共处的观念上所发生的心理的与政治的问题。”
    舒曼的自供与其他西欧国家外长的“解释”充分暴露了美国仆从国家在执行其主子的侵略计划时，对国内人民力量的深刻恐惧。正是各国人民的力量，不仅在三外长会议上，而且也在北大西洋公约理事会上，阻止了美国帝国主义野心计划的通过。
    由于建立西德侵略军的问题未获通过，会议关于建立北大西洋集体部队的计划也就没有能作出如艾奇逊所要求的决定。至于集体部队统帅的人选问题，已移交至定于十月间举行的联合参谋长会议决定。
    美国在会上已逼迫其仆从国家同意的，主要是在军事生产方面。据美国新闻处十七日称：“理事会已通过一个有高度优先权的生产计划，目的专在尽量利用现有的生产潜能来生产军事装备，为此并已通过了一个维持这种生产的短期的财政计划。”但是整个北大西洋侵略集团为支持长期扩军备战而面临的财政问题却并没有能解决。美国新闻处十五日引“官方人士”的谈话称：关于加速军事生产的“财政协议问题，不能希望在这次会议中得出结论，要就这个问题的长远方面达成协议也许要几个星期以至几个月。”
