　　The Growth of Shooting Hero Wei Laiguo
    Calmness is the Only Secret to a Sharpshooter's Perfect Aim
    Wang Jianqing
    "If I don't strike the enemy, the enemy will strike me; if I strike the enemy, I won't be afraid of him striking me." This is the fundamental factor in hero Wei Laiguo's proactive and calm approach to striking the enemy on the battlefield. He said: Being able to shoot accurately doesn't necessarily mean you can kill the enemy. Some people shoot very accurately in peacetime, but they don't kill many enemies on the battlefield, mainly because they aren't calm when aiming. Calmness is the concrete manifestation of an iron will to serve the people. It is also the secret to sharpshooter Wei Laiguo's perfect aim.

  Rather Die Gloriously on the Battlefield Than at Home
    Wei Laiguo is just one of the millions of kind, peace-loving Chinese people. His family lived in a village in Rongcheng County, near Weihaiwei, and from a young age, he witnessed the humiliation and bullying of the Chinese people by imperialists. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, his uncle joined the Eighth Route Army. Traitors often came to the village to threaten his grandmother, demanding that she bring her son back; otherwise, her grandson would be conscripted. From then on, Wei Laiguo didn't dare stay in the village, running around outside all day, making a living as a plasterer. He watched as the village was burned down by the enemy, and property was looted. His fellow villagers, his mother, and his grandmother slept in makeshift shelters on the mountains, exposed to the sun and rain, never getting enough to eat, and often being beaten by Japanese soldiers with rifle butts and whips. Seeing this misery, he could only swallow his tears, constantly thinking about going out to fight the Japanese devils. But his mother couldn't bear to let her only son leave her, and she cried in front of him all day long. In 1942, the enemy became increasingly insane, and it was impossible to stay outside. He hardened his heart and said to his mother: Rather die gloriously on the battlefield than at home. If I don't strike the enemy, the enemy will strike me." He resolutely wiped away his mother's tears and joined the local armed forces of the Eighth Route Army. A month later, their unit was promoted to the Independent Battalion of Rongcheng County in Jiaodong, and he began a strict military life. He was always brave and proactive, and conscientious. In the second year after joining the army, he became a glorious Communist Party member.

  Became Interested in Shooting, Often Practicing Diligently
    When he first practiced target shooting in the platoon, he felt both fear and joy. Coincidentally, the first shot hit the target, and the second shot hit the four ring. He was excited by this unexpected gain, and the platoon leader and comrades especially encouraged him, which made him become interested in shooting, and he often practiced diligently.
    From 1944 to 1945, he received several shooting training sessions, learned to use range finders to measure the deviation of the gun, studied the relationship between terrain, wind direction, climate, the sun, and shooting, as well as methods of shooting from the front, side, and while running. His shooting skills rapidly improved, and he soon became an excellent shooter.

  Guerrilla Warfare Outside Jimo City, Defeated Five Enemy Companies in Twenty Days
    In the autumn of 1945, after Japan surrendered, the people of Shandong, who had endured eight years of bitter fighting behind enemy lines, finally won the victory of the Anti-Japanese War. But at this moment, the shameless Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang unexpectedly sent a large number of troops from the distant south, and incorporated puppet troops and bandits to attack the people who had already won victory. In March 1946, twelve puppet army companies were stationed in Jimo City, burning, killing, and looting all day long. The villagers, watching as the golden wheat could not be harvested, unanimously requested the Liberation Army to protect them. At this time, Wei Laiguo was the platoon leader of the shooting team of a certain regiment. He received an order from his superiors to conduct guerrilla warfare near Jimo City, so he took thirty-odd people, disguised as civilians, and operated in villages seven or eight miles from the city. They laid mines every day, shot from the shadows, and killed the enemy mysteriously. In the past, the enemy looked down on our county brigade. Since this civilian team arrived, the enemy's casualties increased. They said: "This civilian team is simply a divine army, it doesn't fire until it strikes, and when it strikes, it's accurate." The enemy had to secretly carry the corpses out for burial, and the villagers counted them one by one. The most they carried out in one day was more than eighty, sometimes twenty or thirty. Later, the enemy soldiers were so scared that their pants were wet as soon as they heard a gunshot, and they didn't even dare to bury the corpses. The enemy soldiers felt the terror of death, and more than fifty fled in one night. In just twenty days, they defeated five enemy companies and prevented the enemy from coming out to rob.

  Defending Langgezhuang, One Hundred and Twenty Bullets, Killing One Hundred and Ten Enemies
    At the end of June of the same year, the Kuomintang reactionaries' 54th Army invaded Jimo, Jiaodong, while simultaneously attacking Nanquan Station along the Jiaoji Railway. At this time, Wei Laiguo commanded his platoon to defend the Langgezhuang position east of Nanquan. He used his own Type 38 rifle to guard a graveyard, calmly taking advantage of the gaps when the enemy had not yet fired bullets, and proactively shot at the enemy. His bullets flew like a torrential rain, knocking down forty or so enemies in one go. The enemy concentrated all their firepower on the graveyard. When more than two hundred enemies gradually approached, he ordered the entire platoon to fire fiercely, while he himself specialized in shooting enemy commanders. Several times, enemy bullets flew close to his body, but he didn't panic. He maneuvered to another graveyard, widened his eyes, and continued to shoot at the enemy. He fired one hundred and twenty bullets in one breath, killing one hundred and ten enemies. The enemy's second attack was also repelled. After the Nanquan blocking battle, Wei Laiguo was awarded the glorious title of Shandong Shooting Hero. And the Wei Laiguo shooting movement was launched throughout the army. Soon, Wei Laiguo's heroic deeds spread to all battlefields in the liberated areas.

  In the Battle to Blockade Baimaguan, Wei Laiguo Killed More Than Five Hundred Enemies
    In mid-April 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a key offensive against the Shandong Liberated Area with more than eighty brigades (divisions). A certain regiment of the Liberation Army was ordered to defend Baimaguan southwest of Mengyin, in order to coordinate with fraternal units in annihilating the Kuomintang 72nd Division in Tai'an. High mountains stood on both sides of Baimaguan, with a highway running through the middle, and Black Mountain and Yuntou Mountain serving as barriers in front. Hero Wei Laiguo's company defended the Black Mountain position. They put forward the fighting slogan "Our heads can be broken, our blood can flow, but the Baimaguan pass cannot be lost!"
    On April 20th, the reactionaries attacked the Black Mountain position with a battalion of troops. After a fierce artillery bombardment, the KMT bandits advanced in dense formations. Wei Laiguo used a rifle on another hilltop to block a small ditch. Under his gun, the enemies fell one by one. After the enemy's rain of shells landed, the soldiers quickly came out of the bunkers and shot at the enemy. The enemy's seven attacks were all repelled. The next day, two brigades of the enemy once occupied Black Mountain. Wei Laiguo led the entire company in a counterattack against the enemy and recovered the peak of Black Mountain. In two days, Wei Laiguo killed a total of ninety-two enemies. The soldiers boasted that the company commander's rifle was like a heavy machine gun. In the blocking battle of Baimaguan, the entire company killed more than five hundred enemies, completing the glorious task of coordinating with fraternal units to annihilate the Kuomintang 72nd Division. Therefore, Wei Laiguo's company was named "Changmo Company."
    Because Wei Laiguo had a high degree of hatred for the enemy, and was calm and brave on the battlefield, like a fierce tiger. But he was as loving as a brother to the soldiers, and he paid special attention to cultivating the shooting skills of the soldiers wherever he went. After he became the company commander, he cultivated two Zhu De shooters, six special-class shooters, and twenty-seven ordinary shooters from the company he led.

  Attended the World Youth Congress, Received a Warm Welcome and Respect
    In August 1948, Wei Laiguo gloriously attended the World Labor Youth Congress held in Warsaw. He brought the glorious victory of the Chinese people to the youth of all countries in the world, and was warmly welcomed and respected everywhere.
    This young shooting hero, Comrade Wei Laiguo, was promoted to Deputy Chief of the Youth Section of the Political Department of a certain corps this May. He has consistently been proactive and responsible in his work, fully utilizing the bravery, initiative, and vanguard role of the youth in the army. (Attached picture)

　　射击英雄魏来国的成长
    沉着是神枪手百发百中的唯一诀窍
    王剑清
    “我不打敌人，敌人就要打我；我要打敌人，就不怕他打我。”这是英雄魏来国在战场上主动、沉着地打击敌人的基本因素。他说：光会打枪还不一定能打死敌人。有些人平常打枪打的很准，一到战场上，杀伤敌人并不多，主要是他们在瞄准时不沉着。沉着，就是为人民服务的钢铁意志的具体表现。也就是神枪手魏来国百发百中的诀窍。
  与其死在家里，不如光荣地死在战场上
    魏来国同样是千百万个善良的、酷爱和平的中国人民中的一个。他的家庭居住在威海卫附近荣成县的一个乡村里，从小就看见了帝国主义者对中国人民的欺侮凌辱。抗战爆发后，他叔叔参加了八路军。村里常有汉奸来威胁，要他祖母把儿子找回来；若不然，就得把孙儿抓去当兵。从此，魏来国就不敢待在村里，成天到外面奔跑，靠着当泥水匠度日。他眼看着村庄被敌人烧毁，财物被敌人抢劫一空。乡亲们和他的妈妈、祖母成天到山上搭窝铺睡觉，日晒雨淋，终日不得温饱，还经常挨日寇的枪托、皮鞭。他看见这种惨状，只好把眼泪往肚子里流，时刻想着要出外去打鬼子。但他妈妈又不舍得这个独生子离开她，成天在他面前哭哭啼啼。一九四二年，敌人愈来愈疯狂，连外面也待不住了，他硬着心肠对妈妈说：与其死在家里，不如光荣地死在战场上。我不打敌人，敌人就要打我。”他毅然地擦干了妈妈的眼泪，参加了八路军的地方武装。一个月以后，他们的部队就升到了胶东荣成县独立营，从此开始了严格的军人生活。他一贯勇敢积极，认真负责，入伍后的第二年就成为光荣的共产党员。
  对射击发生了兴趣，经常在苦练
    当他在排里第一次练习打靶时，心里又是害怕，又是欢喜。可巧，第一枪打中了靶，第二枪又打中了四环。他为这次意外的收获而感到兴奋，排长和同志们特别的鼓励了他，从此便使他对射击发生了兴趣，经常苦心练习。
    从一九四四到一九四五年，他接连受了几次射击教育，学会了用测定器测定枪的偏差，研究了地形、风向、气候、太阳与射击的关系，正面、侧面、跑步时射击的方法，他的射击技术迅速地提高起来，不久就成为一个出色的射击手。
  即墨城外打游击，二十天打垮了敌人五个连
    一九四五年秋天，日本投降以后，坚持敌后苦战八年的山东人民，终于取得了抗日战争的胜利。但就在这个时候，无耻的蒋介石匪帮竟从遥远的南方开来了大批军队，并收编伪军土匪，向已取得了胜利的人民进攻。一九四六年三月，在即墨城里驻扎着十二个伪军连队，成天出来烧杀抢劫。乡亲们眼看着黄澄澄的麦子收获不到家，一致要求解放军去保卫他们。这时魏来国在某团射击队任排长。他接到上级的命令要到即墨城附近去打游击，于是带了三十几个人，化装成便衣，活动在离城七、八里地的村庄。每天埋地雷，打冷枪，神出鬼没地杀伤敌人。过去敌人对我们的县大队是看不起的。自从这支便衣队来后，敌人伤亡愈来愈多。他们说：“这支便衣队简直是神兵，枪不响则罢，一响就准。”敌人只得偷偷地抬尸首出来掩埋，乡亲们一个个的数着，最多的一天抬过八十多具，有时二、三十具。后来敌伪士兵们一听见枪响就吓的屁滚尿流，连尸首也不敢埋了。敌兵感到死亡的恐怖，一个晚上就逃跑了五十多人。在短短的二十天里面打垮了敌人五个连，阻止了敌伪出来抢劫。
  坚守兰格庄，一百二十颗子弹，打死敌人一百一十个
    同年六月底，国民党反动派五十四军向胶东即墨进犯，同时沿胶济路进攻南泉车站。这时魏来国指挥着他的一个排坚守着南泉以东的兰格庄阵地。他用自己一枝三八式大盖枪守住一片坟地，沉着地利用敌人还没有发出子弹的空隙，主动向敌人射击。他的子弹像暴雨般的飞过去，一气打倒了四十来个。敌人集中全部火力向坟地射击。当二百多敌人渐渐接近的时候，他一面命令全排猛烈射击，自己则专找敌人的指挥官打，有好几次敌人的子弹都紧贴着他的身体飞过，但他毫不惊慌，机动地转移到另一个坟地，圆睁了眼睛继续向敌人射击，他一口气发出了一百二十粒子弹，打死敌人一百一十个。敌人第二次的攻击又被击退了。南泉阻击战以后，魏来国荣膺了山东射击英雄的光荣称号。并在全军展开了魏来国射击运动。不久魏来国的英雄事迹传遍了解放区的各个战场。
  白马关阻击战，魏来国连毙敌五百多
    一九四七年四月中旬，国民党反动派以八十多个旅（师）向山东解放区重点进攻。解放军某团奉命坚守蒙阴西南的白马关，以配合兄弟部队歼灭泰安国民党七十二师的战斗。白马关两边高山屹立，中间有公路穿过，前面有黑山、云头山作屏障。英雄魏来国连就坚守着黑山阵地。他们提出一头可断，血可流，白马关山口不可丢！”的战斗口号。
    四月二十日，反动派以一个营的兵力，向黑山阵地进攻。蒋匪军在一阵猛烈的炮轰之后，密集的队形蜂拥前进。魏来国在另一个山头用一支步枪封锁住一条小沟。在他的枪下，敌人一个一个的倒下了，战士们在敌人雨点般的炮弹落过后，迅速从地堡里出来向敌人射击，敌人七次进犯都被击退。第二天，敌人的两个旅一度攻占了黑山。魏来国率领全连向敌人反冲锋，收回了黑山高峰。在两天里面，魏来国共打死敌人九十二名。战士们都夸耀连长的一支步枪，好比一挺重机枪。在白马关的阻击战中，全连共打死敌人五百多名，完成了配合兄弟部队歼灭国民党七十二师的光荣任务。因此魏来国连被命名为“常模连”。
    由于魏来国对敌人有高度的仇恨，在战场上沉着、勇敢，好像一只猛虎。但他对于战士，却如兄弟般的亲爱，他走到那里，便特别注意培养战士的射击技术。在他当连长以后，从自己所领导的连队里，培养出了朱德射手两名，特等射手六名，普通射手二十七名。
  出席世青代表大会，受到热烈的欢迎与崇敬
    一九四八年八月，魏来国光荣出席在华沙召开的世界劳动青年代表大会上，他把中国人民的光辉胜利带给了世界各国的青年，到处受到了热烈的欢迎与崇敬。
    这位青年的射击英雄魏来国同志，今年五月已被提升为某兵团政治部青年科副科长。他在工作中一贯积极负责，充分地发挥了部队青年的勇敢、积极和先锋的作用。（附图片）
