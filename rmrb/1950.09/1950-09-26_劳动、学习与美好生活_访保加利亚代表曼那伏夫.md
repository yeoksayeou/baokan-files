	Labor, Study, and a Good Life
	An Interview with Bulgarian Representative Mannafov
	The Bulgarian youth representative, Mannafov, is one of the outstanding representatives in the World Federation of Democratic Youth delegation. He participated in the guerrilla war against fascist Germany; after Bulgaria established a people's democratic regime, he played an active role in the youth movement. He is now the editor-in-chief of "People's Youth," the organ of the Dimitrov People's Youth League, a Bulgarian youth organization.
	He briefly described the contributions of Bulgarian youth to the country in production, their studies, and their lives.
	Bulgaria's peaceful economic construction has been underway for six years. When the people's democratic regime was first established and the government's financial and material resources were still limited, Bulgarian youth organized large-scale voluntary labor, saving the state expenses. Students used their vacations to organize youth construction teams to participate in the construction of factories, railways, highways, canals, tractor stations, reservoirs, and other huge projects. They studied the advanced production experience of the Soviet Union to improve their own production technology, playing a significant role in launching socialist production competitions and increasing the enthusiasm of all workers.
	To commend the youth for their contributions to the country, the Bulgarian government awarded the Dimitrov People's Youth League three medals - the People's Freedom Medal, the "Ninth of September" Medal, and the Gold Medal of Labor.
	Bulgarian youth have ample opportunities for learning. The Communist Party, the government, and the Youth League use every method to help young people master advanced production technology and scientific knowledge. Six years ago, when the people's regime was first established, there were 25,000 university students; this year, the number of university students has increased to 45,000, with an average of six university students per thousand people in the country. Young people in factories and rural areas also receive strong government support in their studies. They can participate in various specialized schools according to their own expertise and interests. After studying and mastering technology, they can immediately get appropriate work. There are study classes in factories, led by the best engineers and Stakhanovite movement participants. Young workers who have excellent achievements in production can go to university to study, with the government providing living expenses. This year, such young workers account for 40 percent of Bulgarian university students.
	Bulgarian workers are not only able to work actively, but also good at resting and exercising happily. They work eight hours a day, six days a week and rest for one day, and each person also has fifteen days to one month of vacation every year, with wages paid as usual. During the holidays, they can travel to distant places. Every enterprise has cultural and recreational organizations. Workers with artistic talent discovered in cultural and recreational activities are sent by the government to specialized art schools for study.
	Bulgarian youth also have full political rights. They have the right to vote and be elected at the age of eighteen. The government provides the Youth League with a large amount of housing and educational expenses. With the help of the government, the Youth League publishes its own newspapers, reflecting the achievements of Bulgarian people's construction, unfolding the bright future of socialism, and educating young people to actively participate in various activities, learn advanced production technology, and strive to improve their own lives and the happiness of the next generation.
	The Dimitrov People's Youth League, which leads the Bulgarian youth, is the best assistant of the Bulgarian Communist Party. The Youth League not only educates its 670,000 members, but also educates all Bulgarian youth on how to work for the construction of socialism, carry out socialist production competitions, and call on youth to take the lead in production competitions; at the same time, the Youth League also educates all Bulgarian youth to defend the motherland, defend world peace, and oppose the imperialists' instigation of new wars.

    劳动、学习与美好生活
    访保加利亚代表曼那伏夫
    保加利亚的青年代表曼那伏夫是世界民主青年联盟代表团中出色的代表之一。他参加过反对法西斯德国的游击战争；当保加利亚建立起人民民主政权以后，他在青年运动中又起了积极的作用。现在他是保加利亚的青年组织——季米特洛夫人民青年联盟机关报《人民青年》的总编辑。
    他简单扼要地叙述了保加利亚青年在生产上对国家的贡献，他们的学习和生活。
    保加利亚的和平经济建设已经进行六年了。在人民民主政权刚刚建立，政府的财力物力还很困难的时候，保加利亚的青年组织了大规模的义务劳动，节省了国家的开支。学生们利用假期，组织青年建设队，参加建设工厂、铁路、公路、运河、拖拉机站、蓄水池等巨大的工程，他们研究苏联的先进生产经验，提高自己的生产技术。在发动社会主义的生产竞赛和提高全体工人的热情上起了很大的作用。
    保加利亚政府为了表扬青年们给国家的贡献，曾经授给季米特洛夫人民青年联盟三个勋章——人民自由勋章、“九九”勋章和金质的劳动勋章。
    保加利亚青年有充分的学习机会。共产党、政府和青年联盟用一切方法帮助青年掌握先进的生产技术和科学知识。六年前人民政权刚刚建立的时候，大学生有二万五千人，今年大学生的数目已经增加到四万五千人，全国平均每一千人中有六个大学生。工厂和农村中的青年在学习上也得到政府大力的帮助。他们可以依照自己的特长和兴趣参加各种专门学校。他们经过学习，掌握了技术，立刻可以得到适当的工作。工厂里有学习班，由最好的工程师和斯达汉诺夫运动者领导。在生产上有优越成绩的青年工人可以到大学去学习，由政府供给生活费用。今年保加利亚的大学生中，这样的青年工人占了百分之四十。
    保加利亚的工人们不仅能够积极地工作，也善于愉快地休息和运动。他们每天工作八小时，工作六天休息一天，每年每人还有十五天到一个月的假期，工资照领，假期中他们可以到远地去旅行。每个企业中都有文化娱乐的组织，在文娱活动中发现了有艺术天才的工人，政府就送他们进艺术专门学校去学习。
    保加利亚的青年在政治上也有充分的权利。他们十八岁就有选举权和被选举权。政府供给青年联盟大量的房屋和文教费用。青年联盟在政府的帮助下出版了自己的报纸，在报纸上反映了保加利亚人民建设的成就，展开了社会主义的光明的前途，教育了青年们积极参加各种活动，学习先进的生产技术，为改善自己的生活和为了下一代的幸福而奋斗。
    领导保加利亚青年的季米特洛夫人民青年联盟是保加利亚共产党的最好的助手。青年联盟不仅教育着自己的六十七万盟员，而且也在教育着全保加利亚青年怎样为建设社会主义而工作，开展社会主义生产竞赛，号召青年在生产竞赛中带头；同时青年联盟也教育着全保加利亚的青年保卫祖国，保卫世界和平，反对帝国主义挑动新的战争。（附图片）
