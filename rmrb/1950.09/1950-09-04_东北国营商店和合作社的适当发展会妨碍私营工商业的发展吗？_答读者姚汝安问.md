　　Will the Proper Development of State-Owned Stores and Cooperatives in Northeast China Hinder the Development of Private Industry and Commerce?
            ——Answering Reader Yao Ru'an's Question
To the Editor:
    In the third part of the report "Standing at the Forefront of Northeast Economic Construction" by Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, it is mentioned that in the commercial aspect, the planned total retail sales of state-owned stores and cooperatives this year will account for about 50% of the total social retail circulation (compared to 34% last year)... and preparations are being made to increase the 372 state-owned retail stores in 1949 to 1,500, and to develop the 9,000 cooperatives in 1949 in a conditional and step-by-step manner. I would like to ask, will this hinder the development of private industry and commerce?
                                                       Yao Ru'an
Comrade Yao Ru'an:
    The planned total retail sales of state-owned retail stores and cooperatives in Northeast China this year, accounting for about 50% of the total social circulation, is calculated based on the production plan of Northeast state-owned industry (accounting for more than 85% of the total industry in Northeast China) and this year's agricultural production plan (requiring the production of 18 million tons of grain). In order to sell this batch of industrial products controlled by the state to the broad masses of the people (mainly farmers) at reasonable prices, and to enable farmers to continuously supply cities with grain and industrial raw materials at reasonable prices, a very strong commercial organization is needed to complete this task. The existing public and private commercial organizations in Northeast China are not sufficient to complete such a huge commercial task.
    For example, Songjiang Province was an area affected by drought last year. Initially, it was generally estimated that the state's investment in industrial products worth 80,000 tons of grain would be enough to meet the needs of farmers throughout the province. However, in reality, farmers in the province purchased industrial products equivalent to 320,000 tons of grain up to April of this year, and there were still 60,000 to 70,000 tons of surplus grain that could not be sold, and this year's autumn harvest is coming again! According to an incomplete statistic, the quantity of living materials and production materials required by farmers in Songjiang Province amounts to more than 200 kinds, but Harbin City can only supply less than 30 kinds. Even these 30-odd kinds of goods urgently needed by farmers are still lacking in state-owned retail stores and cooperatives.
    According to the estimate of the Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government, the purchasing power of farmers this year may reach the value of 5 million tons of grain, and next year it will reach more than 8 million tons. In addition, Northeast China also has about 10 million urban residents, including 1.3 million workers, and the purchasing power of one worker is equal to that of 25 farmers, that is to say, this purchasing power is equivalent to 30 million rural people.
    In order to meet such a broad market, it is necessary to increase the number of state-owned retail stores and cooperatives.
    However, will this result in squeezing out private industry and commerce? No, it won't. Legitimate private industry and commerce are constantly developing.
    The state-owned economy in Northeast China has been rising in a straight line. However, private industry and commerce are also developing. Taking Shenyang as an example, the number of private industrial and commercial enterprises has increased from 17,580 in the early days of liberation to 30,040 in April of this year; taking Harbin as an example, by the end of June this year, private enterprises had developed to 24,957, which is 2,375 more than the highest record of prosperity during the People's Liberation War. The capital of private industry and commerce in Shenyang City increased from 133.93 billion (Northeast currency, same below) in April last year to 250.13 billion in April this year. In one year, it increased by more than 80%. This shows that in the New Democratic China, after the completion of land reform, not only does the state-owned economy have unlimited prospects for development, but the private economy also has extremely broad prospects. Everyone should work hard to move forward.

### 东北国营商店和合作社的适当发展会妨碍私营工商业的发展吗？——答读者姚汝安问

　　东北国营商店和合作社的适当发展会妨碍私营工商业的发展吗？
            ——答读者姚汝安问编辑同志：
    东北人民政府高岗主席在《站在东北经济建设的最前面》的报告第三部分里谈到，关于商业方面，计划今年国营商店和合作社零售总额，约占社会零售流通总额的百分之五十（去年为百分之三十四）……并准备把一九四九年的国营零售商店三百七十二处增加到一千五百处，在一九四九年九千个合作社的基础上，有条件有步骤地加以发展。请问，这样做的结果，是否会妨碍私营工商业的发展？
                                                       姚汝安姚汝安同志：
    东北国营零售商店和合作社零售总额，在今年计划约占社会流通总额的百分之五十，是根据东北国营工业（约占东北全部工业的百分之八十五以上）的生产计划和今年农业生产计划（要求生产粮食一千八百万吨）的规模来计算的。为了使这批国家所掌握的工业品，能够以合理的价格销售给广大人民（主要是农民），并使得农民在合理的价格下，源源不断地供给城市以粮食和工业原料。是需要很强大的商业机构，才能完成这一个任务的。东北现有的公私商业机构，对于完成这样巨大的商业任务来说，还是不够的。
    例如，松江省在去年是受旱灾的地区，最初一般地估计：国家投入八万吨粮食价值的工业品，就可以满足全省农民的要求。但实际上，该省农民迄至今年四月份止，购买了相当于三十二万吨粮食的工业品，还有六、七万吨余粮则无法销售，而今年的秋收又将来临！根据一个不完全的统计，松江省农民要求的生活资料和生产资料的数量达二百余种，但哈尔滨市所能供给者不足三十种，就是这些农民急需的三十多种物品，在国营零售商店和合作社里还是缺乏的。
    据东北人民政府贸易部估计：今年农民的购买力，可能达到五百万吨粮食的价值，而明年则将达到八百万吨以上。另外，东北还拥有一千万左右的城市人口，其中有一百三十万工人，而一个工人的购买力则等于二十五个农民，就是说，这个购买力相当于三千万农村人口。
    为着满足这样宽阔的市场，国营零售商店和合作社的增加是必要的。
    但是，这样做的结果，是否会排挤了私营工商业呢？不会的。正当的私营工商业正在不断地发展中。
    东北国营经济一直是直线上升的。但是，私营工商业也在发展。以沈阳为例，私营工商业已由解放初期的一万七千五百八十家增至今年四月的三万零四十家；又以哈尔滨为例，至今年六月底止，私营企业已发展到二万四千九百五十七家。比在人民解放战争时繁荣的最高纪录多出二千三百七十五家。沈阳市私营工商业的资金，从去年四月的一万三千三百九十三亿（东北币、下同），增加到今年四月的二万五千零十三亿。一年来，增加了百分之八十以上。这就说明，在新民主主义的中国，在土地改革完成之后，不仅国营经济有无限发展的前途，私营经济也有极为广阔的天地。大家都应当向前努力。 编者
