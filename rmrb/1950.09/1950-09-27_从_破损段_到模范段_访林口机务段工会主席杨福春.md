From "Damaged Section" to Model Section
    ——An Interview with Yang Fuchun, Chairman of the LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union
    Chen Ji
    A major event occurred on the People's Railway on April 15th this year at the Harbin Railway Administration: all locomotives in the entire depot safely traveled 1,140,000 kilometers for 288 days without a single accident. This was the first time in the history of the People's Railway at that time. This great achievement was the result of the correct leadership of the workers' production movement by the LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union and its constant concern for the workers' interests.

  Recollections of the "Damaged Section"
    When the news that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions had directly selected the LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union as a delegate to the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers reached LinKou, the workers were overjoyed, and the trade union cadres were too happy to speak. They clearly remembered that before July of last year, the LinKou Locomotive Depot was still a "damaged section." At that time, the quality of the locomotives was poor, the train crews and repair workers were not united, and accidents occurred frequently. Locomotive "No. 916" was known as the "Accident King." They never thought that in just over a year, under the leadership of the trade union, they would create brilliant achievements and gain such glory today. Trade Union Chairman Yang Fuchun recalled the past situation and said: "Last 'May Day,' none of our depot's representatives were elected at the Northeast Railway Labor Model Conference. Seeing others receive medals and red flags, we felt really bad." Although they felt bad, they could not find the reason for their backwardness. They felt that others had engaged in production competitions and made a name for themselves; we didn't, so we fell behind. Therefore, the Party, government, and trade union held a meeting and hurriedly made a decision: to cultivate typical locomotives and break through 100,000 kilometers between major inspections; to launch a 200,000-kilometer safe running campaign throughout the depot. However, this decision was not discussed by the masses but was carried out by a few trade union cadres and activists. They ran around, focusing on cultivating typical locomotives "No. 1016" and "No. 916," without mobilizing the broad masses. These two typical locomotives had daily observers (people specially assigned to provide guidance) and were frequently visited by leaders from higher levels. The workers on other locomotives were somewhat dissatisfied with this situation: "Typical cars are important in every way, but it's not shameful for our backward cars to have accidents." The typical examples were divorced from the masses, and the 200,000-kilometer safe running campaign failed twice. Of the 16 locomotives in the entire depot, 13 had accidents. If this continued, the hope of becoming a model section would be even more distant. The activists reflected: "We must make a self-criticism!" On July 8th, the entire depot held a meeting, and the leading cadres made a profound self-criticism; the workers were moved and expressed one after another: "We are also at fault!" Liu Runze, a worker who was prone to accidents, resolved: "I must work hard to turn the work around." The workers spontaneously proposed: "Let's start another safe running kilometer campaign." At this meeting, the trade union also issued a call: unite and help each other, and absolutely not let this campaign fail. Under the conscious demands of the masses and the leadership of the trade union, the LinKou Locomotive Depot launched its third safe running kilometer campaign.

  The Trade Union Puts its Main Strength on the Main Production Issues
    "Put the main strength on the main production issues!" Trade union cadres attended administrative reports every day, often talked with the workers, and found that the most frequent accident in the past was the overheating of the axle. The trade union seized this major problem, concentrated its efforts to find a solution. The trade union first convened workers and technicians to repeatedly investigate the cause of the axle overheating and study ways to overcome it, and took this as the central issue to be discussed by the trade union groups. After their discussion, they concluded that the causes of axle overheating were threefold: careless factory repairs, train crews not providing oil properly, and poor oil quality. In a word, it was the evil result of everyone's irresponsibility. Once the conclusion was consistent, the trade union was still afraid that backward elements would suspect that the axle overheating was due to the inherent poor quality of the locomotive and that they had no responsibility. Therefore, they specially found a locomotive that had often suffered axle overheating accidents in the past and focused on cultivating it. On the one hand, they urged the repair workers to repair it carefully, and on the other hand, they helped the train crews pay attention to inspection. Sure enough, this locomotive no longer suffered axle overheating accidents and became a model locomotive. This vivid fact completely dispelled the doubts of the backward elements.

  Implement the Responsibility System
    If accidents are to be prevented, it is certainly not enough to overcome only one problem. The train crew of locomotive "No. 1016" was right in saying: "As long as we are a little irresponsible, accidents will happen." The fundamental key lies in implementing the responsibility system. The LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union seized this key again and asked the workers to discuss it. The workers said: "Our factory and transport departments are always bickering. When an accident occurs, you say I'm wrong, and I say you're not good, and the responsibility is unclear." According to the workers' reflection, the trade union found that the organization of the factory and transport departments was not right. The two teams in the factory had to repair the locomotives of the three teams in the transport department. This division of labor was unclear, and the responsibility system could not be implemented. The trade union immediately submitted this issue to the management committee for research, and it was decided to change the original organization, combine the three teams of the transport department into two teams to make it consistent with the organization of the factory department. Team A of the factory was responsible for repairing the locomotives of Team A of the transport department, and Team B of the factory was responsible for repairing the locomotives of Team B of the transport department. With the responsibilities of the two teams clearly defined, the responsibility could be implemented. Not long after the organization was changed, a production competition was launched between the two teams on the basis of the responsibility system. They competed with each other on the condition of ensuring no accidents, comparing the quality of the locomotives and the safe kilometers. The teams also competed with each other: the factory guaranteed to repair the cars quickly and well; the transport guaranteed that the train crews would carefully maintain the locomotives and pay attention to refueling. On this basis, the trade union also represented the workers in guaranteeing to the administration that there would be no accidents. This made the responsibilities clear between all departments and individuals in the entire depot, ensuring that accidents no longer occurred.

  Unite All the Workers
    If there are no accidents in the entire depot, it is equivalent to every locomotive traveling safely, which requires everyone to be responsible and united like a family. The LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union understands that in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to closely unite all the workers.

    How to closely unite all the workers? The chairman of the LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union said that the first step is of course to closely rely on Party members, Youth League members and activists. With them, there will be leaders in the work. The LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union can be well-oriented to production, and the main strength is these leaders. But relying solely on these people is not enough. The second step is to do a good job in uniting and transforming backward elements. In this regard, the LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union has been very successful. The driver Gao Chao Kui has always been irresponsible in his work. When driving, he opened the steam valve and ran without worrying about the damaged parts and without putting in enough sand, which often caused accidents. Many workers reflected: "Gao is destroying our depot's safe kilometer campaign." He felt even more unhappy. The higher authorities asked him to be stationed in Jiamusi, and he was a little unhappy. The trade union understood that he had many family matters, and it was indeed a bit difficult to be stationed in a distant place. The trade union chairman Yang Fuchun then mobilized the workers to help his family chop firewood and fetch water in their spare time. When Gao Chao Kui returned home, he saw that his water tank was full of water and the kitchen was full of firewood and asked: "Who did this for us?" His wife said to him: "The trade union! The trade union takes care of us like this, you have to work hard!" When the trade union chairman talked to him again and criticized his past shortcomings, he said with emotion: "I was wrong in the past. I have to be active and never bother you." Gao Chao Kui finally became an activist and became a model iron ox team member and never had an accident again.

  To Unite All the Workers, We Must Care About Their Difficulties
    The third step in uniting all workers - said Trade Union Chairman Yang Fuchun - is that the trade union must constantly care about the interests of the workers and solve their difficulties. "Some difficulties need to be solved, but the administration does not have the strength to solve them, so what should we do?" This is a question that many trade union cadres often ask. The LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union relies on the strength of the masses to solve these difficulties. The LinKou Locomotive Depot suffered major damage during the enemy and puppet era. Warehouses, canteens, bathhouses, and workers' clubs were all dilapidated or non-existent. The trade union explained the difficult situation of the administration to the workers and asked the workers to discuss solutions. The workers said, "We can solve some equipment problems with our own labor." The trade union said, "We can solve it ourselves, but we must not affect production or our health." Under this principle, the workers used Sundays and spare time to cut grass, pull soil, and collect the scattered blue bricks and wood allowed by the government, and successively built more than 40 rooms (two meters wide and six meters long), spending only a small amount of raw materials and tools from the administration. In the remote LinKou Locomotive Depot, the workers looked at, used, and enjoyed the clubs, canteens, bathhouses, and trade union offices they built themselves, and they felt unspeakable happiness in their hearts. A worker wrote in a newsletter to the staff: "Using our own strength to build a home through hard work not only solved the administration's financial difficulties, but also improved our welfare."

    Some difficulties can be solved by the administration, and the trade union should suggest that the administration handle them, and cannot ignore them. The LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union has never neglected this point. The old workers Wang Xiangchen and Zhao Zhongshan were too old, and the administration said that they could not take on production work in the depot. The trade union took the initiative to find the administration and suggested that they be transferred to appropriate work positions in dormitories, canteens, etc. The administration accepted this suggestion and transferred their work. Now they are competent and happy in their new work positions, and people reflect that they are doing a good job. There are no dormitories for single people in the depot, which affects production and needs to be solved urgently. The trade union suggested that the administration solve it. As a result, a private house was purchased near the site, which solved the accommodation problem.

    The LinKou Locomotive Depot Trade Union united all the workers in this way, making the trade union establish a strong foundation among the masses. 100% of the employees in the entire depot joined the trade union, and the safe running kilometer campaign led by the trade union was vigorously developed.

  Democratic Mobilization, Brilliant Achievements
    On October 7th last year, the employees celebrated the safe running of 350,000 kilometers in the entire depot. The venue was full of slogans and cartoons, but the huge slogan hanging in front of the stage read: "Celebrate the completion of 350,000 kilometers without accidents, and continue to strive for ○○ safe kilometers." The workers were very strange and asked: "Why are there two blank words in the slogan?" Trade Union Chairman Yang Fuchun said: "These two words have not been discussed by everyone, and the trade union cannot randomly formulate them. The achievements belong to everyone, and the goals of struggle must also be set by everyone." At that time, a worker asked loudly: "How many kilometers should we strive for?" Below, they answered in unison: "500,000?" The trade union formulated the goals of struggle in this similar democratic way, and the workers completed the 800,000, 1 million, and 1.14 million kilometer accident-free campaign with such conscious action. In the safe kilometer campaign, the "No. 1016" backbone iron ox locomotive emerged, setting a new national record of 210,000 kilometers of extended major inspection mileage. The special-class labor hero Shi Kun was produced. From January to the end of August this year, the locomotives in the entire depot exceeded the axle load (exceeded the prescribed load weight) by more than 478,000 tons, which is equivalent to the locomotives traveling 440 more trips. Of the 19 locomotives in the entire depot, 18 became iron oxen. The LinKou Locomotive Depot changed from a damaged section to a model section.

    These brilliant achievements are inseparable from the leadership of the trade union.

    Currently, the workers of the LinKou Locomotive Depot are carrying out a major production competition under the leadership of the trade union to welcome the first National Day and the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers. The workers told their trade union chairman Yang Fuchun: After arriving in Beijing, don't forget to say hello to Chairman Mao and wish Chairman Mao good health!

　　从“破损段”到模范段
    ——访林口机务段工会主席杨福春
    陈迹
    今年四月十五日哈尔滨铁路管理局发生了一件人民铁路上的大事情：全段所有机车二百八十八天安全走行了一百一十四万公里，没有出过一次事故。这在当时人民铁路史上还是头一次，这个伟大成就是林口机务段工会正确地领导了工人生产运动和处处关心工人利益的结果。
  “破损段”的回忆
    当中华全国总工会直接评选林口机务段工会为出席全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议代表的消息传到了林口，工人们欢欣若狂，工会干部也喜欢得说不出话来，他们清楚地记得去年七月以前林口机务段还是一个“破损段”，那时候机车质量不好，乘务员和修理工人互不团结，常常出事故，“九一六号”机车被人称为“事故大王”。他们那里会想到在工会的领导下，仅仅一年多时间就创造了辉煌成绩，获得了今天这样的光荣。工会主席杨福春回忆着过去的情形道：“去年‘五一’，咱们段的代表在东北铁路劳模大会上，没有一个被当选，眼看着人家领奖章得红旗，心里真够难受。”心里虽难受，但他们还找不出工作落后的原因来。他们觉得人家搞生产竞赛运动，搞出名堂来了；咱们没搞，所以落后了。于是党政工开了会，匆匆忙忙作出决定：培养典型机车，突破十万甲检公里；全段来个二十万公里安全走行运动。但是这个决定没有经过群众的讨论，就由几个工会干部和积极分子搞起来了。他们东奔西跑，专心培养“一○一六号”“九一六号”典型机车，没有去带动广大群众。这两台典型机车天天有添乘（有专人上车指导），时时受到上级的亲切慰问。其他机车的工友看见这般情景，都有点不服气：“人家典型车什么都重要，咱们落后车出事故也不算丢人。”典型脱离群众，二十万安全走行公里运动，搞了两次都落了空。全段十六台机车，就有十三台出了事故。这样搞下去，争取做模范段的希望更渺茫了。积极分子反映：“咱们非检讨不可哪！”七月八日全段召开大会，领导干部作了深刻检讨；工人们都受感动，纷纷表示：“咱们也有错呵！”爱出事故的工友刘润泽立下决心：“咱一定得努力，把工作扭转过来。”工人们自动提出：“咱们再来搞一次安全走行公里运动。”这个大会上工会也作了号召：团结互助，绝对不让这次运动落空。在群众自觉要求和工会领导下，林口机务段第三次展开了安全走行公里运动。
  工会把主要力量放在主要的生产问题上
    “把主要力量放在主要的生产问题上！”工会干部每天参加行政汇报，经常和工人们谈话，发现过去最多的事故是大轴发热。工会抓到这个主要毛病，集中精力寻求解决的途径。工会首先召集工人、技术人员开会，反复追究大轴发热的原因，研究克服的办法，并把这当作中心问题，交给工会小组讨论。这样经过他们讨论得出结论：大轴发热的原因有三点：工厂修理不仔细，乘务员没有很好地给油，油质买得不好，一句话，是大伙不负责任的恶果。结论一致了，工会还恐怕落后分子怀疑，说什么大轴发热是机车本来就不好，自己没有啥责任，所以特别找了一台过去常犯大轴发热事故的机车，重点培养，一方面督促修理工人细心修理，一方面又帮助乘务员注意检点。果然这台机车不再发生大轴发热事故了，变成了模范的机车。这种活生生的事实根本消除了落后分子的怀疑。
  贯彻实现负责制
    要想事故不发生，当然不只克服这一种毛病。“一○一六号”机车的乘务员说得对：“只要我们有一点儿不负责，事故就会来到。”根本关键是在于实现负责制。林口机务段工会又抓住了这个关键，要求工人们讨论。工人们说：“咱们工厂和运转两部门老是闹蹩扭，事故发生了，你说我不对，我说你不好，责任弄不清。”根据工人的反映，工会发现工厂和运转两部门的组织不对头，工厂两个队要包修运转三个队的机车，这样分工不明，实行不了责任制。工会随即把这个问题提交管理委员会研究，决定改变原来组织，将运转部门的三个队合编为两个队，使其和工厂部门的组织一致，工厂甲队专门包修运转甲队的机车，工厂乙队专门包修运转乙队的机车。甲乙两队责任分明了，才能贯彻负责。组织改变了不久，在责任制的基础上，两队掀起了生产竞赛，他们互相以保证不出事故的条件，比机车的质量，比安全公里。每队之间也相互竞赛：工厂保证修车修得快，修得好；运转保证乘务员小心爱护机车，注意给油。在这样的基础上，工会又代表工人向行政保证不出事故。这样就使得整个段内各部门、各人之间责任明确，保证了事故不再发生。
  团结全体工人群众
    全段不出事故，就等于台台机车都要安全行走，就得要求每个人都要负责任，团结像一家人。林口机务段工会懂得要达到这个目的，必须紧紧地团结全体工人。
    怎样紧紧地团结全体工人呢？林口机务段工会主席说，第一步当然要紧紧依靠党员、团员和积极分子，有了他们，工作才有领头人。林口机务段工会能够很好地面向生产，主要的力量就是这些领头人。但是光靠这些人，还是搞不好的，第二步就得做好团结和改造落后分子的工作。在这方面，林口机务段工会是做得很成功的。司机高朝奎工作一贯吊儿浪当，不负责任，开车时拉开汽门就跑，不管损坏了的机件，不放足砂子，常常出事故。许多工人反映：“高某人破坏咱段里的安全公里运动。”他心里越发不高兴。上级叫他去佳木斯驻勤，他有些不高兴，工会了解他家庭的事情多，驻勤远地，确也有些困难。工会主席杨福春便发动工人在空闲的时间里帮助他家劈柴、挑水。高朝奎回到家，看见他家水缸盛着满满的水，厨房里堆满燃柴，问道：“是谁给咱干的？”他媳妇对他说：“工会！工会这样照顾咱们，你可得好好干活呵！”当工会主席再找他谈话，批评他过去缺点时，他感动地说：“过去咱不对，咱得积极起来，决不劳你们费心。”高朝奎终于变成了积极分子，成了模范铁牛队员，再也没出事故。
  团结全体工人，就得关心工人的困难
    团结全体工人的第三步工作——工会主席杨福春说——就是工会必须要经常不断地关心工人利益，替工人解决困难。“有些困难，是需要解决的，但行政没有力量解决，那么怎么办呢？”这是许多工会干部常常提出来的疑问。林口机务段工会对于这些困难是依靠群众的力量来解决的。林口机务段在敌伪时代曾遭受重大破坏，库房、食堂、澡堂和工人俱乐部都残缺不堪，或者是根本没有。工会把行政上困难情形给工人解释清楚，并要求工人商量解决的办法。工人说，“有些设备，咱们可以用自己的劳动来解决。”工会说，“咱们可以自己来解决，但决不能影响生产，影响咱们的身体健康。”在这个原则下，工人们利用礼拜日，工余时间到外面去割草、拉土，搜集为政府所允许搜集的散失各地的青砖，和木料先后盖了四十多间房（二公尺宽，六公尺长），只花费行政上少许原料和工具的费用。在荒僻的林口机务段，工人们看着、用着和享受着自己建筑的俱乐部、食堂、澡堂和工会办公室，心里有说不出的快乐。有个工人在给职工报的通讯稿上写着：“用咱们力量，刻苦兴家，不仅解决了行政上财政的困难，而且改善了咱们的福利。”
    有些困难，行政上是可以解决的，工会就要建议行政去办，不能不闻不问。林口机务段工会对于这一点，从来没有忽视。老工人王相臣和赵忠山，年纪太大，行政方面说，不能担任段内生产工作，工会就主动地找行政，建议把他们调到宿舍、食堂等适当的工作岗位上，行政上接受了这个意见，调动了他俩工作，现在他俩在新的工作岗位上，胜任愉快，人家反映他们工作很好。段上单身人没有宿舍，影响生产，亟需解决，工会就建议行政解决，结果在现场附近买了一座民房，解决了这个住宿问题。
    林口机务段工会这样地团结全体工人，使工会在群众中建立了坚强的基础，全段员工百分之百加入了工会，工会领导的安全走行公里运动得到蓬勃的发展。
  民主的动员，辉煌的成绩
    去年十月七日，员工们欢庆全段安全走行三十五万公里，会场上贴满标语、漫画，但在会场台前悬挂的巨形标语写着：“庆祝完成三十五万公里无事故，继续向○○万安全公里奋斗。”工人看了很奇怪，问道：“为什么标语里留了两个空白字？”工会主席杨福春说：“这两个字未经过大家讨论，工会不能随便拟定，成绩是大家的，奋斗的目标也得大家订。”当时有工人高声问：“咱们该向多少公里奋斗呀？”下面齐声答道：“五十万？”工会就是以这种相类似的民主方式，制定了奋斗目标，工人就以这样自觉行动完成了八十万、一百万、一百十四万公里无事故运动。在安全公里运动中，出现了“一○一六号”基干铁牛机车，走行二十一万甲检延长公里的全国新纪录，产生了特等劳动英雄石昆，今年一月至八月底全段机车共超轴（超过规定载重量）四十七万八千多吨，等于机车多走了四百四十趟。全段十九台机车，就有十八台成了铁牛。林口机务段从破损段变成模范段。
    这辉煌的成就是和工会的领导分不开的。
    目前林口机务段的工人们正以实际的行动，在工会领导下开展生产大竞赛，来迎接第一国庆日和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议，工人们告诉他们的工会主席杨福春：到北京后，千万别忘记问毛主席好，祝毛主席健康！
