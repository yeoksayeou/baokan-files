　　Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Anti-British National Liberation War
    Malayan Communist Party and National Liberation Army Issue Declaration
    Calling on All Malayan People to Unite and Strive for Victory

　　The Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party and the General Headquarters of the Malayan National Liberation Army issued the "Declaration Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the Anti-British National Liberation War" on June 20th.

　　The declaration pointed out: The British colonialists launched a frenzied offensive against the Malayan people, and their conspiracy and plan to eliminate the revolutionary forces in a short period of time have completely failed. From the beginning of the war to the end of 1949, in the eighteen months, the British colonialists mobilized 130,000 armed military police, paid 1.275 billion yuan in war expenses (excluding the more than 300,000 yuan spent directly from the local Malayan finances every day), and suffered 12,000 military police casualties. What they gained was the increasing expansion and consolidation of the Malayan National Liberation Army, the increasing determination and confidence of the broad masses of the people in their struggle, and the increasing isolation and difficulty of the British colonialists. The British colonialists have had to admit their failure.

　　The declaration continued: The reason why the Malayan national liberation movement has achieved great victories is the increasing expansion and strengthening of the determination to struggle of the working class and peasant ranks of all ethnic groups in Malaya, who are united around the Malayan Communist Party and have been tested by more than 20 years of arduous struggle; secondly, it is the correctness of launching active, mass guerrilla strategies in all states and counties of Malaya under the guidance of the Communist Party; another important factor is the unprecedented growth of the power of the peace, democracy, and anti-imperialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the great victory of the Chinese revolution.

　　After analyzing that the strength of the world's peace and democracy camp has greatly surpassed the strength of the imperialist and reactionary camp, the declaration pointed out: American imperialism has become increasingly rampant in intensifying its expansion of its influence in Southeast Asia, and is increasingly blatantly supporting the British colonialists' colonial war of slaughtering the Malayan people. However, the victories of the Chinese and Vietnamese people have proved that the imperialists' war adventures and acts of aggression will bring nothing but their own demise.

　　The declaration calls on all commanders and fighters of the Malayan National Liberation Army to actively and proactively organize battles, strike at the enemy, seize weapons, and consolidate and establish more base areas; it calls on all the people of Malaya to unite and actively support the Liberation Army, and to greet the third year of the war with more heroic combat actions and strive for greater victories.

　　纪念反英民族解放战争两周年
    马共及民族解放军发表宣言
    号召全马人民团结一致争取胜利
    【新华社一日讯】马来亚共产党中央委员会与马来亚民族解放军总司令部，于六月二十日发表了“纪念反英民族解放战争两周年宣言”。
    宣言指出：英国殖民者向马来亚人民展开疯狂进攻，妄图在短时期内消灭革命力量的阴谋和计划，已经完全失败。从战争开始到一九四九年年底的十八个月中，英国殖民者动员了十三万武装军警，付出了十二亿七千五百万元（还不包括直接从马来亚当地财政支出的每天的三十多万元）的战费，及一万二千名军警伤亡的代价，而所换来的结果是马来亚民族解放军的日益扩大和巩固，广大人民斗争的决心和信心的日益坚强，与英国殖民者的日益孤立和困难。英国殖民者已不得不承认自己的失败。
    宣言继续指出：马来亚民族解放运动之所以能获得极大的胜利，是团结在马来亚共产党周围、经过二十多年艰苦斗争考验的马来亚各民族工人阶级和农民队伍的日益扩大和斗争决心的坚强；其次是在共产党指导下，在全马来亚各州各县发动主动的、群众性的游击战略的正确；另一个重要因素就是以苏联为首的和平民主与反帝国主义阵营的力量空前壮大，和中国革命得到了伟大的胜利。
    宣言在分析了世界和平民主阵营的力量已大大超过帝国主义反动阵营的力量之后指出：美帝国主义已经愈来愈嚣张地加紧扩张其在东南亚的势力，并愈加露骨地支援英国殖民者屠杀马来亚人民的殖民战争。但是，中国和越南人民的胜利已经证明：帝国主义的战争冒险和侵略行为，除了将带来它们本身的灭亡以外，绝不会有别的结果。
    宣言号召马来亚民族解放军的全体指战员积极地主动组织战斗，打击敌人，夺取武器，巩固和建立更多的根据地；号召全马来亚人民团结一致积极支援解放军，以更英勇的战斗行动去迎接战争的第三个年头，争取更大的胜利。
