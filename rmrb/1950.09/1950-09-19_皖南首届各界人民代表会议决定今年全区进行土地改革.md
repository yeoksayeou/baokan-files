　　Wuhu Dispatch: The Southern Anhui Administrative Region has held its first People's Representative Conference. The conference decided to carry out land reform in the entire region this autumn and winter, and to earnestly do a good job in financial and economic work, striving for a fundamental improvement in the national financial and economic situation.

　　The conference listened to, discussed, and approved the report on land reform in the Southern Anhui region by Ma Tianshui, secretary of the CCP Southern Anhui Regional Committee. The conference also listened to and approved the report on the financial and economic work of the Southern Anhui region by Wei Ming, director of the Southern Anhui People's Administrative Office.

　　The conference believes that Southern Anhui has long adhered to revolutionary struggle, and various tasks already have a relatively solid foundation. In the year since liberation, bandits have been basically eliminated throughout the region, and rural social order has been stabilized; most areas of the region carried out anti-local tyrant and rent reduction movements last autumn and winter, and established farmers' associations and militia organizations in this movement. Currently, the region has 800,000 members of farmers' associations and over 70,000 militiamen; the political power organizations in nearly half of the villages in the region have been preliminarily re-elected. At present, all parts of the region are training cadres above the district and village levels to participate in land reform work. Therefore, the region already possesses the basic conditions for implementing land reform. The conference decided to universally implement land reform throughout the region this autumn and winter. By the end of February next year, the land reform work of all 22 counties and 3.8 million agricultural population in the region will be fully completed; in March, it can enter into a comprehensive production movement. The conference made specific resolutions on how to conduct land reform in a led, planned, and orderly manner. All representatives unanimously supported carrying out land reform in the entire region, and expressed that they will fight to complete this great historical task.

　　The conference also listened to the report by Hu Ming, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, on the spirit of the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Second Session of the East China Military and Political Committee. The conference elected the chairman, vice-chairmen, and members of the Consultative Committee of the First People's Representative Conference. The conference was held from August 20th to 28th, with 303 representatives attending.

　　皖南首届各界人民代表会议决定今年全区进行土地改革
    【新华社上海十三日电】芜湖讯：皖南行政区已举行第一届各界人民代表会议。会议确定在今年秋冬两季，在全区进行土地改革，并切实做好财政经济工作，争取国家财政经济情况的基本好转。
    会议听取、讨论并通过了中共皖南区委员会书记马天水关于皖南区土地改革的报告。会议并听取和通过了皖南人民行政公署主任魏明关于皖南区财政经济工作的报告。
    会议认为：皖南曾长期坚持革命斗争，各项工作已较有基础。解放一年来，全区股匪已基本肃清，农村社会秩序业已安定；全区绝大部分地区曾于去年秋冬进行反恶霸和减租运动，并在这一运动中建立了农民协会和民兵组织，现全区已有农民协会会员八十万和民兵七万余人；全区近半数村庄的政权组织已经初步改选。目前全区各地正在训练区、村以上准备参加土地改革工作的干部。所以该区已经具备实行土地改革的基本条件。会议决定：今年秋冬全区普遍实行土地改革。到明年二月底，全部完成全区二十二个县、三百八十万农业人口的土地改革工作；三月份即可进入全面的生产运动。会议对如何有领导、有计划、有秩序地进行土地改革，都作了具体决议。全体代表一致拥护在全区进行土地改革，并表示将为完成这一伟大的历史任务而奋斗。
    会议并曾听取了人民政协全国委员会委员胡明关于人民政协全国委员会第二次会议、华东军政委员会第二次委员会议的精神的传达报告。会议选出了第一届各界人民代表会议协商委员会的正副主席和委员。会议于八月二十日到二十八日举行，出席代表三百零三人。
