　　A Gift to Celebrate National Day!
    Dalian Yuandian Paint Factory Completes Annual Production Plan
    [Our Newspaper] Workers are rushing to produce grand gifts to celebrate the first National Day of the People's Republic of China. The Dalian Far East Electric Company Paint Factory has completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule.
    The slogan put forward by the Dalian Far East Electric Company Paint Factory, "Strive to complete 105% of the annual production plan before National Day as a gift to celebrate National Day," has been achieved ahead of schedule on September 15th amidst a lively production competition throughout the factory. The main reason for the factory's early completion of the production plan is that, in the competition, workers have been striving to improve production methods to show their love for the motherland, thus greatly increasing productivity. For example, the paint workshop improved the method of grinding gray paint, shortening the mixing time required for each grind of paint by 26.6%. Coupled with the workers' competitive enthusiasm, the output was increased by 30%, and the quality was also greatly improved. This new method was quickly promoted throughout the paint workshop, increasing the output of each mill by 20% to 30%. Du Wenzhi, a worker in the lead carbonate workshop, based on his practical experience in adding materials to the mill, suggested breaking the original five-minute fixed time for adding materials and implementing a new four-and-a-half-minute fixed time, pressing five more small carts of stone per shift. As a result, the average output in August increased by 30%. Furthermore, the amount of water used for floating lead carbonate was further adjusted appropriately according to the size of the mill, so that the floating speed was uniform, and the quality was greatly improved. For example, No. 2 (inferior) lead carbonate previously accounted for 32.4% of the total output, but now only accounts for 15%, and the No. 4 residue has also been reduced from 35% to 32%. In order to realize their competition plan, the workers of the electrical fire department started a competition between individuals, which rapidly increased output. The average output of barrel burning in August increased by 33.3% compared to the past. In the competition, the workers in the barrel making workshop increased the output of the three stages of edge banding, rolling, and crimping by 33% to 46% compared to the past, while also reducing rework. This year, the factory's workers have put forward a total of 134 suggestions for improving production, of which 84 have been adopted and applied to production. These rationalization proposals have had a great impact on production. In accordance with the collective contract, the factory administration has widely implemented a piece-rate wage system and distributed the plan to each workshop five days in advance each month for workers to discuss, which has also greatly increased the workers' enthusiasm for production.

　　迎接国庆日的献礼！
    大连远电油漆厂完成全年生产计划
    【本报讯】工人纷纷赶制隆重献礼以迎接中华人民共和国第一个国庆日，大连远东电业公司油漆厂已提前完成生产计划。
    大连远东电业公司油漆厂提出的“争取在国庆节前完成全年生产计划百分之一百零五，作为迎接国庆节献礼”的口号，在全厂热火朝天的生产竞赛中，已于九月十五日提前完成了全年计划。该厂提前完成生产计划，主要原因是由于在竞赛中，工人们为了表示对祖国的热爱，纷纷努力设法改进生产方法，因之大大提高了生产率。如油漆车间改良了压灰色油漆的方法，每碾油漆所需调合时间缩短了百分之二十六·六，加上工人的竞赛热情，所以能提高产量到百分之三十，质量方面也有很大改进。这个新办法迅速推广到了全油漆车间，每台碾子都提高了产量百分之二十到三十。胡粉车间工人杜文智根据其实际操作碾子添料的经验，建议打破原定五分钟的添料定时，实行四分半的新定时，每班多压五小车石头，结果八月份产量平均提高百分之三十。另在掌握漂胡粉的水量上进一步根据碾子范围的大小适当调剂，使漂流速度均匀，所以质量又大为提高。如二号（较次等品）胡粉前占总产量百分之三十二·四，现在仅占百分之十五，四号残渣也已由百分之三十五降为百分之三十二。电火部的工人为了实现自己的竞赛计划，个人与个人搞起了竞赛，使产量迅速提高，八月份平均烧桶产量较前提高了百分之三十三·三。制筒车间的工人在竞赛中打边、滚边、卷边三个阶段产量都较过去提高了百分之三十三到四十六，同时返工品也减少了。该厂本年内工人总共提出改进生产的建议一百三十四件，经采纳运用到生产中去的八十四件，这些合理化建议直接对生产起了很大作用。该厂行政按集体合同规定，广泛实行了计件工资制及每月提前五天将计划发到各车间让工人讨论，也大大地提高了工人的生产热情。
