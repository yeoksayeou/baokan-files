　　Zhou Enlai Cables Jebb and Lie
    Security Council Discussion of Our Accusation Against the U.S. Aggression of Taiwan Must Include Our Representatives to Attend and Participate in the Discussion
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, telegraphed Jebb, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Lie on the 16th, pointing out that at the Security Council meeting on September 11th, under the manipulation and obstruction of the United States, our reasonable request that our representatives must attend to present opinions and participate in the discussion when the Council discusses our accusation against the U.S. aircraft infringing on our airspace was rejected. This completely violates the United Nations Charter. He firmly demanded that procedurally, it should first be decided that our representatives must attend, present opinions and participate in the discussion when the Security Council discusses the agenda of our accusation against the United States' armed aggression against Taiwan on September 18th. The text of the cable is as follows: Lake Success, New York, Mr. Jebb, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Mr. Lie, Secretary-General:
    On September 10th, I telegraphed you, proposing that the Security Council must have representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend to present opinions and participate in the discussion when discussing the case of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China accusing the military aircraft of the United States' army of aggression against Korea of intruding into the airspace of the People's Republic of China, strafing and killing Chinese people, and damaging Chinese property. This reasonable request was agreed to by six countries at the Security Council meeting on September 11th, but due to the manipulation and obstruction of the United States, this reasonable request was rejected, which is a complete violation of the United Nations Charter.
    The United Nations Security Council has already passed on August 29th to include the case of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China accusing the United States' armed aggression against China's territory of Taiwan on the agenda, and recently decided to start discussing it on September 18th. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government representing the Chinese people, and at the same time is the proposer and accuser of this accusation case, and has the full right and necessity to send its own delegation to participate and attend the United Nations Security Council.
    I, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, make a firm request to the United Nations Security Council: The Security Council must have representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend, present opinions and participate in the discussion when carrying out the above agenda; this is the first issue that should be resolved procedurally. If the Security Council carries out the above agenda without the representatives of the People's Republic of China attending and participating in the discussion, all its resolutions will be illegal and therefore invalid.
    This is to inform you, I hope you will take note.
    Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
    September 16, 1950, Beijing

　　周外长致电杰伯及赖伊
    安理会讨论我控美侵略台湾案必须有我国代表出席参加讨论
    【新华社十六日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于十六日致电联合国安全理事会主席杰伯及秘书长赖伊，指出安全理事会九月十一日的会议，在美国操纵和阻挠之下，竟使我国所提在该会讨论我国控诉美机侵犯我领空案时，必须有我国代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论的合理要求遭到拒绝。这完全违背了联合国宪章。并坚决要求，程序上应首先决定，安全理事会在九月十八日对我国控诉美国武装侵略台湾的议程进行讨论时，必须有我国代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论。电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国安全理事会主席杰伯先生及秘书长赖伊先生：
    九月十日我曾致电给阁下，提出安全理事会在讨论中华人民共和国中央人民政府控诉美国侵略朝鲜军队的军用飞机侵入中华人民共和国领空扫射、杀伤中国人民、损坏中国财产一案时，必须有中华人民共和国的代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论的要求。这一合理的要求，在九月十一日的安全理事会会议中获得六国的赞同，但由于美国的操纵和阻挠，竟使此合理要求遭到拒绝，这是完全违背联合国宪章的。
    联合国安全理事会于八月二十九日业已通过将中华人民共和国中央人民政府控诉美国武装侵略中国领土台湾一案列入议程，并于最近决定在九月十八日开始讨论。中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，同时又是这一控诉案的提案者和控诉者，完全有权利和必要派遣自己的代表团参加和出席联合国安全理事会。
    我代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府向联合国安全理事会提出坚决要求：安全理事会在进行上述议程时必须有中华人民共和国的代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论；这是程序上首先应解决的问题。安全理事会如果在没有中华人民共和国代表出席和参加讨论的情况下进行上述议程，则其所作的一切决议都将是非法的，因而也将是无效的。
    专此奉达，即希查照。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
    一九五○年九月十六日于北京
