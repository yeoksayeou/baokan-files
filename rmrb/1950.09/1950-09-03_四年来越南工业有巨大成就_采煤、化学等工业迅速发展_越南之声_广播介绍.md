Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. "Voice of Vietnam" broadcast on the evening of August 31st, introducing the development of Vietnamese industry, stating: Vietnamese industry has achieved rapid development in the past four years. After the outbreak of the war, almost all factories moved from cities to the countryside. Coal mines have started work in accordance with government orders. Coal production rose sharply from 1,100 tons in 1947 to 10,200 tons in 1949. During the same period, ammunition production increased tenfold, and phosphorus production increased fourfold; antimony and sulfur have also begun production.

Like mining, Vietnam's chemical industry began to develop at the beginning of the patriotic war. Vietnamese chemists have worked hard to study domestically produced substitutes to replace imported chemicals. In 1948, Professor Phan Dinh Hai produced sulfuric acid for the first time. At the end of 1949, the total output of sulfuric acid increased by 490 percent, and the total output of nitric acid increased by 500 percent. Vietnamese researchers have also produced sodium, 90% purity alcohol, glycerin and other chemicals.

While promoting these chemical industries, the Vietnamese government constantly encourages the development of smaller-scale industries. In the past four years, the production of milk, cigars, honey, cotton cloth and salt has been increasing. In 1949, the First and Fourth Military Regions alone produced 13 million meters of cotton cloth. In central and southern Vietnam, the output of paper mills is sufficient for local use. In the past few years, whether it is books and newspapers published by the Vietnamese Ministry of Education or people's organizations and private publications, or 100,000 popular books published by Vietnamese mass education institutions, they are all printed with Vietnamese-made paper. Recently, Vietnamese manufacturers have been able to produce pens, fountain pens, ink, raincoats and other items that are cheaper and of better quality than before the war.

The machines for manufacturing these items were pieced together by Vietnamese workers using parts from old machines. Domestic raw materials have been widely used in these industries. Potassium extracted from grass ash has been used in the soap industry, and candles have been used instead of paraffin in the manufacture of stencil paper.

The Vietnamese people, especially the workers, have made many creations in improving their technology. The development of the cooperative movement has also helped increase production.

Thanks to the continuous efforts of the Vietnamese people and the full assistance of the government, the Vietnamese people have almost everything they need in terms of food, clothing and military equipment to carry out a protracted war of resistance. They are now doing their best to produce more and better goods, and are confident of achieving complete victory in the upcoming general counter-offensive.

　　四年来越南工业有巨大成就
    采煤、化学等工业迅速发展
    “越南之声”广播介绍
    【新华社二日讯】越南通讯社讯：“越南之声”于八月三十一日晚发表广播，介绍越南工业的发展情况称：越南工业在过去四年中已获得迅速的发展。战争爆发后，差不多所有工厂都由城市迁往乡村。煤矿已遵照政府命令开工。煤产量由一九四七年的一千一百吨急升为一九四九年的一万零二百吨。在同一时期中，弹药产量增加十倍，磷产量增加四倍；锑和硫也已开始生产。
    和矿业一样，越南的化学工业在爱国战争初期就已开始发展。越南化学家们曾努力研究土制的代用品，以代替舶来化学品。一九四八年潘定海教授第一次制造了硫酸。一九四九年末，硫酸的总产量增加百分之四百九十，硝酸的总产量增加百分之五百。越南研究员们也制造出钠、纯度百分之九十的酒精、甘油和其他化学品。
    越南政府一方面推进这些化学工业，一方面经常鼓励规模较小的工业的发展。过去四年中，奶类、雪茄、蜂蜜、棉布和盐的产量都在增加中。一九四九年仅第一军区和第四军区就已出产了一千三百万公尺的棉布。在中越南部，纸厂的出品已足供当地之用。在过去几年中，无论越南教育部或人民团体和私人出版的书报，以及越南民众教育机关出版的十万册通俗书籍，都是用越南造的纸张印刷的。近来越南的制造厂已能出产价钱比战前便宜、质量比战前好的钢笔、自来水笔、墨水、雨衣以及其他物品。
    制造这些物品的机器，是越南工人用旧机器的零件拼成的。在这些工业中，曾广泛应用本国原料，从草灰里提炼出来的钾已用于肥皂工业，在制造蜡纸时已用蜡烛代替石蜡。
    越南人民特别是工人在改进他们的技术中曾有许多创造。合作运动的发展也有助于产量的增加。
    由于越南人民自己的不断努力和政府的全力援助，越南人民差不多已经有了一切食物、衣著和军事装备来进行长期抗战。他们现在正在尽全力出产更多更好的物品，并有信心在即将到来的总反攻中得到完全的胜利。
