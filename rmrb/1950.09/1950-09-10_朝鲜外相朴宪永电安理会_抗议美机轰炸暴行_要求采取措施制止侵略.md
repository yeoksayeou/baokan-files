Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, August 8th: US bombers indiscriminately bombed and strafed medical vehicles in the Pyonggang County railway station area of ​​Kangwon Province on August 27, killing and wounding many patients and destroying two medical vehicles. In response, Park Heon-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a cable to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the President of the Security Council on September 4, protesting the barbaric violations of the Geneva Convention and international regulations by the American armed interventionists, and demanding that the United Nations promptly take necessary measures to stop the atrocities of the US troops in Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, September 9th: Park Heon-young, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, cabled the President of the United Nations Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the 7th, once again protesting the atrocities of the US invading army's aircraft in indiscriminately bombing and strafing peaceful cities, villages, and residents of Korea, and resolutely demanded that the Security Council promptly take measures to stop the crimes of the US aggressors.

The telegram pointed out: "Because the Anglo-American bloc has refused to discuss the statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the Security Council, the Security Council has so far not taken any measures to stop the atrocities of the US armed interventionists."

After listing the various facts of the intensified bombing and strafing of peaceful Korean cities, towns, and residents by US aircraft in the month since the Democratic People's Republic of Korea first submitted a statement to the Security Council on August 5, the telegram pointed out: "These atrocities by the American interventionists are resented by everyone and are violations of international law. The facts prove how brazen Acheson's recent statement that the US Air Force only bombed military targets was."

The telegram finally requested the President of the Security Council and the Secretary-General of the United Nations to forward this statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to all member states of the Security Council and member states of the United Nations.

　　朝鲜外相朴宪永电安理会
    抗议美机轰炸暴行
    要求采取措施制止侵略
    【新华社平壤八日电】美国轰炸机于八月二十七日在江原道平康郡车站地区，对医疗车滥施炸射，死伤病患者多人，并烧毁医疗车两辆。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永为此于九月四日致电联合国秘书长与安理会主席，抗议美国武装干涉者野蛮地违反日内瓦公约和国际法规的罪恶行为，并要求联合国迅速采取必要措施，制止美国军队在朝鲜的暴行。
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相朴宪永，于七日致电联合国安全理事会主席与联合国秘书长，再度抗议美国侵略军队的飞机对朝鲜和平城市、农村与居民滥施炸射的暴行，并坚决要求安理会迅速采取措施，制止美国侵略者的罪行。
    电文指出：“由于美英集团在安理会上拒绝讨论朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的声明，安理会迄今尚未采取制止美国武装干涉者暴行的任何办法”。
    电文在列举八月五日朝鲜民主主义人民共和国第一次向安理会提出声明以来的一个月中，美机变本加厉地炸射朝鲜和平城乡与居民的种种事实后，指出：“美国干涉者的这种暴行，是人人愤恨的；是违反国际法的行为。事实证明，艾奇逊在最近发表的声明中所谓美空军只轰炸军事目标云云，是何等的厚颜无耻”。
    电文最后要求安理会主席与联合国秘书长，将朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的此项声明，转达给全体安理会理事国和联合国会员国。
