　　Railway Ministry Youth Cultural Train to Return to Beijing for National Day Celebrations

　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Railway Ministry's Youth Cultural Train, over the past six months, has performed nearly 140 times on the Jinghan, Longhai, Yuehan, Guangjiu, Guangsan, and Xianggui lines, and participated in the opening ceremonies of China's two famous bridges (the Luohe Zheng Bridge and the Liujiang Bridge). Preliminary statistics show that the organized audience reached over 300,000 people. They had already received instructions from the Railway Ministry to rest for two weeks, but due to the staff's requests everywhere, they were unable to return to Beijing as scheduled. Now, as the performance mission in Jiangnan is completed, it is precisely the time for the first anniversary of the People's Republic of China. It is expected that after the performance at Changsha Station on the 20th, they will arrive in Beijing before the 28th to participate in the grand National Day celebrations.

　　铁道部青年文化列车将返京参加国庆盛典
    【本报讯】铁道部青年文化列车，六个月来，在京汉、陇海、粤汉、广九、广三、湘桂各线共演出近一百四十余次，并参加中国两座有名的大桥的通车典礼（洛河正桥、柳江大桥）。有组织的观众就初步统计达三十万人以上。他们早已奉铁道部指示休息两星期，但因到处员工挽留，未能预期返京。现在当江南演出任务完成之际，正是中华人民共和国一周年纪念的时候，预计二十日在长沙车站演出后，二十八日前可抵北京，参加盛大的国庆典礼。
