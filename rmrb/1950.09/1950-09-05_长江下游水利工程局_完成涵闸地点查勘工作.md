Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th. In order to reduce flood damage in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and improve the drainage and irrigation of farmland along the river, the Lower Yangtze River Water Conservancy Bureau plans to build several important sluice gates along the river next spring. To this end, the bureau began surveying sluice gate locations in early July this year. After more than a month of efforts, it has completed the survey of nineteen sluice gate locations in the Jiangsu Province counties of Jiangdu, Zhenjiang, Yizheng, Nantong, Haimen, and the Anhui Province counties of Wangjiang, Tonglu (newly established county between Tongcheng and Lujiang), He County, Wuhu, and Guichi.
