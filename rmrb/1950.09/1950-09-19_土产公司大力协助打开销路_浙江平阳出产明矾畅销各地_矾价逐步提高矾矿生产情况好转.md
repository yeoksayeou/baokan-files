　　With the Vigorous Assistance of Local Product Companies in Opening Sales Channels, Alum Produced in Pingyang, Zhejiang Sells Well in Various Places; Alum Prices Gradually Increase and the Production Situation of Alum Mines Improves
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Zhejiang Provincial Branch of the China Native Produce Company has opened up sales channels for alum, and a large quantity of alum from the province is selling well in various places. The alum produced in Pingyang, Zhejiang, is an industrial raw material that was previously transported by sea to places like Beijing and Shanghai. Currently, due to the fact that sea transport is not yet fully smooth, there has been a disconnection between production and sales areas; sales in the production area are sluggish and prices are weak, while there are shortages everywhere in the sales areas. In order to change this situation and ensure the supply of industrial raw materials, the Zhejiang Provincial Company of the China Native Produce Company has been actively trying to open up sales channels through land transportation since mid-June. The first batch of more than 700 tons of alum has been transferred to Beijing, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other places via Jinhua, and has been completely sold out; the second batch of 1,200 tons is also being shipped.
　　Since sales of Pingyang alum have opened up and after being purchased by the company, alum prices have gradually increased, rising from 70,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan per dan, an increase of 33.3 percent, and the production situation of the alum mines has improved as a result. Private merchants have also started purchasing under the influence of state-owned enterprise purchases. Based on this situation, the production and sales of Pingyang alum are expected to improve further in the future.

　　土产公司大力协助打开销路
    浙江平阳出产明矾畅销各地
    矾价逐步提高矾矿生产情况好转
    【本报讯】中国土产公司浙江省分公司，打开明矾销路，省内大批明矾畅销各地。浙江平阳出产的明矾，为工业原料之一，往年均经海道运销京、沪等地。目前因海运尚未完全畅通，以致发生了产销区运销脱节现象；产区销路呆滞价格疲落，而销区却有到处缺货情形。中国土产公司浙江省公司为转变此种情况，并保证工业原料的供应，自六月中旬起积极设法通过陆运打开销路，首批明矾七百余吨已经经金华转运至京、津、穗、沪等地，业已全部销完；第二批一千二百吨亦正在启运中。
    平阳明矾自销路打开及经公司收购后，矾价已逐步提高，每担由七万元涨至十万元，上涨了百分之三十三点三，矾矿生产情况因之好转。私商在公营企业收购影响下，亦已展开收购。根据此一情况，今后平阳明矾产销情况，当能更趋好转。
