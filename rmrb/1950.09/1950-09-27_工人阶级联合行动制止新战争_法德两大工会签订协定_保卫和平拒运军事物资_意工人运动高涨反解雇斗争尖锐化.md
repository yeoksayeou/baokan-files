　　Workers Class United Action to Stop New War
    French and German Trade Unions Sign Agreement to Defend Peace and Refuse to Transport Military Supplies
    Italian Workers' Movement Surges, Anti-Layoff Struggle Intensifies
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] According to TASS, Paris, 23rd: The French National Federation of Dockworkers and Port Workers and the Transport Workers' Union of the German Democratic Republic, to express their determination to stop a new war and defend peace, have signed an agreement to refuse to transport military supplies, calling on all dockworkers, sailors, and inland waterway transport workers in France and West Germany not to load or unload military supplies in the ports of both countries.
    To implement this agreement, the two trade unions unanimously decided that peace committees must be established in every dock, port, ship, and warehouse. At the same time, the peace committees established by the dockworkers must immediately establish contact with the peace committees established by sailors, inland waterway transport workers, railway workers, and motor transport workers to take joint action to prevent the re-transport of military supplies that have already been unloaded against the will of the dockworkers. The two trade unions guarantee to expand this movement to refuse to transport military supplies, and to further establish contact with the peace committees of Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Britain, Norway, Sweden, and Finland.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 26th] The Italian labor movement is facing a new upsurge. According to Agenzia Telegrafica Italiana, Rome: All Italian railway workers have launched a general strike since the 19th to demand increased wages. The strike is being carried out in a "sporadic" manner, with different regions striking each day, paralyzing the entire railway system.
    The Italian railway general strike is a prelude to the upsurge of the Italian labor movement. Recently, Italian workers have been engaged in struggles to demand increased wages and oppose layoffs. To this end, the Italian General Confederation of Labour, together with the Confederation of Free Trade Unions of Workers (Christian Democrat) and the Italian Labour Union (right-wing socialist), passed a decision on unified action at the beginning of this month, and resumed negotiations with the Italian Industrialists' Confederation on wages and layoffs issues from September 12. However, the Industrialists' Confederation has consistently maintained a stubborn attitude, simply refusing the three trade unions' suggestion that employers should not lay off workers at will. Vittorio, the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour, announced at a press conference that Italian workers have become impatient with the employers' delaying tactics, and guaranteed that the General Confederation of Labour, together with the other two trade unions, will defeat any conspiracy by the employers. Therefore, according to Agenzia Telegrafica Italiana, "the entire labor situation in Italy has entered a critical stage." Now, the anti-layoff struggle has been widely launched in many industrial areas. Workers at the "Ansaldo" shipyard in Genoa have refused the order to lay off 3,000 workers. The factory committee of the "Breda" machine manufacturing factory in Milan province has refused the order to lay off 1,800 employees. The strike held by the "Pignone" metallurgical factory in Florence in opposition to the layoff of 300 workers has lasted for more than 30 days. Many factories throughout the province of Florence have held sympathy strikes.
    The struggle is particularly acute at the "Nobel" factory (in the province of Pescara) under the "Montecatini" chemical monopoly. The factory announced its closure, refused to increase wages and reinstate those who had been laid off, and called in the police to "guard" the factory. All the workers in the province of Pescara therefore launched a 12-hour general strike on the 14th to protest the brutal treatment of the workers. The peasants also organized demonstrations and protest rallies, and raised money and food to help the laid-off workers.

　　工人阶级联合行动制止新战争
    法德两大工会签订协定  保卫和平拒运军事物资
    意工人运动高涨反解雇斗争尖锐化
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十三日讯：法国全国码头工人及海港工人联合会与德意志民主共和国运输工人工会，为表示制止新战争和保卫和平的决心，顷已签订拒运军火协定，号召法国和西德的一切码头工人、海员和内河运输工人们，在两国港口概不装运起卸军事物资。
    为实现这一协定，两工会一致决定；在每一码头、港口、船只与仓库所在地，都必须成立和平委员会。同时，码头工人所成立的各和平委员会，必须立即与海员、内河运输工人、铁路工人以及汽车运输工人等所成立的各和平委员会建立联系，以便采取联合行动，制止把过去违背码头工人意志业已起卸的军事物资，再行转运。两工会保证扩大这一拒运军火运动，进一步与意大利、比利时、荷兰、英国、挪威、瑞典和芬兰的各和平委员会建立联系。
    【新华社二十六日讯】意大利劳工运动正面临新的高涨。据电通社罗马消息：意大利全体铁路工人为要求增加工资，已于十九日起发动总罢工。罢工以“零星”的方式进行，每一天在不同地区罢工，使铁路系统全部陷于瘫痪。
    意大利铁路总罢工乃是意大利工人运动高涨的前奏。最近以来，意大利工人一直在进行着要求增加工资与反对解雇的斗争。意大利总工会为此已与基督教民主党的劳动人民工会联合会与右翼社会党的意大利劳工联盟于本月初通过一致行动的决定，与资方的意大利工业家联合会于九月十二日起就工资与解雇问题恢复谈判。但是，工业家联合会始终坚持顽固态度，干脆拒绝三工会所提雇主不得随意解雇工人的建议。总工会总书记维多里奥在记者招待会上宣布：意大利工人对雇主的延宕策略已感到不耐烦，并保证总工会与其他两工会联合一起将击败雇主的任何阴谋。因此，据电通社指出：“意大利的整个劳工情况已进入尖锐阶段。”现在，反解雇斗争已在很多工业区域广泛展开。热那亚“安莎尔多”造船厂的工人，拒绝了解雇三千名工人的命令。米兰省“布雷达”机器制造厂工厂委员会，拒绝了解雇一千八百名职工的命令。佛罗伦萨“皮农民”冶金工厂因反对解雇三百名工人而举行的罢工，至今已延续三十余日。佛罗伦萨全省许多工厂都举行了同情罢工。
    “蒙特卡提民”化学垄断公司属下的“诺伯尔”工厂（在贝斯加拉省），斗争特别尖锐。厂方宣布关厂，拒绝增加工资和恢复被解雇者的工作，并把警察召来“守卫”工厂。全贝斯加拉省工人因此于十四日发动了十二小时的总罢工，抗议对工人的残暴待遇。农民们也组织了示威和抗议集会，并募捐金钱和食物，援助被解雇的工人。
