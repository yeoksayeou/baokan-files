Xinhua News Agency, September 25th: On September 19th, the Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly opened. The representative of India proposed that the representative of the People's Republic of China represent China at the General Assembly, and suggested that other United Nations agencies take similar actions. The representative of the Soviet Union proposed two motions: that the United Nations General Assembly expel the illegal "representatives" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique, and that the representatives designated by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China be invited to participate in the work of the General Assembly and its affiliated agencies. Under the manipulation and obstruction of the United States, the United Nations General Assembly rejected the legitimate and legal proposals of the Indian and Soviet representatives. On September 23rd, the United Nations General Assembly illegally passed a resolution by the Credentials Committee that the credentials of the so-called "Chinese National Government" of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique were qualified, and rejected the motion by the Soviet representative that the decision submitted to the General Assembly by the Credentials Committee was illegal and that the Chinese Kuomintang delegation be cancelled. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China hereby issues the following statement on this matter:

　　The Chinese people warmly welcome the efforts made by the representatives of India and the Soviet Union at the United Nations General Assembly. The proposals made by the representatives of India and the Soviet Union to the United Nations General Assembly are completely justified and legal. The United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the proposals of the Indian and Soviet representatives and refusal to allow our representatives to participate in the United Nations and all its affiliated agencies is completely unreasonable and completely illegal. The Chinese people cannot accept this decision which violates the United Nations Charter.

　　The Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique has long lost any legal or factual basis to represent the Chinese people. The United Nations General Assembly's rejection of the Soviet proposal and its continued allowance of this group of illegal "representatives" of "morally bankrupt murderers" to sit in the United Nations is truly a great shame for the United Nations. This situation, which ignores the solemn demands of the 475 million people of the People's Republic of China, is intolerable to the Chinese people. Therefore, the principle that the United Nations must act in accordance with the unanimous spirit of the five major powers cannot be realized, and all resolutions of this nature in the United Nations will be illegal and invalid.

　　The Chinese people are fully aware that this time, the United Nations General Assembly's refusal to allow the legitimate representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate, like the previous refusals by other United Nations agencies to allow our representatives to participate, is the result of the US government's opposition to the 475 million Chinese people and its manipulation and deliberate obstruction. The US government should bear the primary responsibility for this illegal decision.

　　It should be emphasized that the US government's deliberate obstruction of our representatives' participation and its tolerance of that group of illegal "representatives" of "morally bankrupt murderers" in the United Nations is a fixed step in its entire conspiracy to invade China and expand the war. All countries that support and condone this action by the United States cannot but share the consequences arising from this action by the United States.

　　It should also be pointed out that some countries that have already declared their willingness to establish diplomatic relations with China, while supporting India's proposal to invite our representatives to attend the General Assembly, have refused to support the Soviet representative's proposal to expel the illegal "representatives" of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique from the United Nations, thereby facilitating the realization of the US conspiracy. The Chinese people are continuing to closely monitor the attitude of these self-contradictory and inconsistent countries in the United Nations.

　　The Chinese people resolutely oppose the illegal decision of the United Nations General Assembly to refuse our representatives' participation. The Chinese people know that this is part of the US government's conspiracy to invade China and expand the war, but the Chinese people have full confidence in crushing all the conspiracies of the United States.

　　外交部发言人发表声明
    中国人民完全有信心粉碎美国侵略阴谋
    坚决反对联大拒我代表参加的非法决定
    【新华社二十五日讯】九月十九日，联合国第五届大会开幕，印度代表提出由我中华人民共和国的代表代表中国出席大会，并建议联合国其他机构采取类似行动的提案，苏联代表提出联合国大会驱逐国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表”，以及邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府所指定的代表参加大会及其所属各机构工作的两个提案。联合国大会在美国操纵多数和阻挠之下，竟否决了印苏两国代表的正当的合法的提案。九月二十三日，联合国大会又非法通过了全权证书委员会认为国民党反动残余集团的所谓“中国国民政府”之证书为合格的决议，并否决了苏联代表所提的全权证书委员会提交大会的决定为不合法并取消中国国民党代表团的动议。中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部发言人，特就此事，发表下列声明：
    中国人民热烈欢迎印度与苏联两国代表在联合国大会所作的努力。印度与苏联两国代表向联合国大会提出的提案是完全正当的，合法的；联合国大会否决印苏两国代表的提案，拒绝我国代表参加联合国及其所属一切机构，是完全没有道理的，完全非法的；中国人民不能接受这个破坏联合国宪章的决定。
    中国国民党反动残余集团早就丧失了代表中国人民的任何法律的与事实的根据，联合国大会否决苏联提案，仍然让这一批“丧失道德的杀人犯伙帮”的非法“代表”，安坐在联合国内，实在是联合国的绝大耻辱；这种无视中华人民共和国四亿七千五百万人民的严正要求的状况是中国人民所不能忍受的，因而联合国内必须根据五大国共同一致的精神行事的原则就无从实现，而联合国凡关此类性质的决议都将是非法的和无效的。
    中国人民完全知道：这一次联合国大会拒绝我中华人民共和国合法代表参加，和以往联合国其他机构拒绝我代表参加一样，是美国政府与四亿七千五百万的中国人民为敌并百般操纵和蓄意阻挠的结果；美国政府应负这一非法决定的主要责任。
    应该着重指出：美国政府蓄意阻挠我国代表参加，容留那一批“丧尽道德的杀人犯伙帮”的非法“代表”在联合国内，是它侵略中国及扩大战争的全部阴谋中的一个既定步骤。所有支持和坐视美国这一行动的国家，不能不分担美国这一行动所引起的后果。
    同样应该提出的是某一些已经声明愿和中国建交的国家，虽然支持了印度邀请我国代表出席大会的提案，但竟拒绝支持苏联代表驱逐中国国民党反动残余集团在联合国的非法“代表”的提案；从而方便了美国阴谋的实现。中国人民正继续密切注视这一些自相矛盾和言行不符的国家在联合国的态度。
    中国人民坚决反对联合国大会拒绝我国代表参加的非法决定，中国人民知道，这是美国政府侵略中国、扩大战争的阴谋的一部分，但中国人民完全有信心粉碎美国的全部阴谋。
