Guerrilla Heroine Tu Xun

	In February 1949, Tu Xun was a student at Kunhua Girls' Middle School in Kunming. The student movement in Kunming gave this girl, who came from a mountain village in Chuxiong, Yunnan, a preliminary political education. One day, she suddenly saw in the newspaper that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit 26th Army had massacred more than two hundred young students on the south bank of the Panjiang River in Huaning County. The crime for which these young people were killed was participating in the Yunnan People's Anti-Chiang Self-Rescue Army led by Comrade Zhu Jiabi. The blood of the killed dyed the river red. Holding the newspaper, Tu Xun's hands trembled, as if the newspaper was also stained with the blood of her young comrades. "No, if we don't fight it, our people will be wiped out," Tu Xun made up her mind.

	In March 1949, Tu Xun was already a service member of a certain unit of the Yunnan People's Anti-Chiang Self-Rescue Army (half a month later, the CCP Central Committee gave this unit the designation of the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Border Column of the People's Liberation Army).

	"If you want a gun, go find the enemy!" The town of Sijie was defended by the enemy, and the troops decided to attack this small town to seize the enemy's weapons to arm themselves.

	Tu Xun asked the leadership to become a formal combatant and requested to join the assault team attacking Sijie Town. When the leadership considered that she was a female student who had just come out of school and hoped that she would stay in the rear, Tu Xun argued anxiously: "The enemy's massacre and humiliation of our revolutionary people does not distinguish between men and women. Shouldn't our hatred and resistance to the enemy be prevented and restricted by physical conditions?"

	She joined her first battle. She bent down consciously and calmly, and followed the assault team members quickly climbing up the branches of trees, climbing the walls, and rushing into the town hall of Sijie Town. More than forty enemies collapsed, and they won the victory of obtaining more than a thousand bullets.

	The troops went deep into the enemy's heartland. There was an important town called Awuzhai at the junction of Quxi, Jianjiu, Shiping, and Longwu. The big local tyrant Zhang Zhenguo desperately spread rumors to threaten the masses, saying that even if the Communist Party liberated the whole of China, it would not be able to enter his Awuzhai.

	The company to which Tu Xun belonged was ordered to attack Awuzhai. At this time, Tu Xun had been promoted to the deputy political instructor of the company, and she led an assault platoon forward. The guide led them quietly along the narrow paddy field sandwiched between two peaks to approach the寨 wall, crossing the outer 寨. Tu Xun was the first to jump into the围 wall, and the machine gunner and two soldiers followed. The sky was already dimly lit, and the sounds of people milling rice and dogs barking vibrated crisply in the air. The machine gunner became timid and said to Tu Xun, "Instructor! The enemy is about to find out. It would be too embarrassing if we don't catch them. Let's go back." Tu Xun corrected him, saying: "It is most embarrassing to desert in the face of battle!" She calmly placed the two of them in a toilet, and then went out to bring in the other seven soldiers. At this time, the 寨 realized what was happening, and the first gunshot rang out. She still calmly directed six soldiers to block the two blockhouses, two soldiers to guard the wall, and one to block the mountain road behind. She and the machine gunner blocked the gate of Zhang Zhenguo's house. Gunshots rang out far and near, and a person suddenly broke out from the gate and was shot dead by a burst of the machine gunner.

	"Brother, brother! The Red Army uncles are here. The young master has been shot to death. Come out quickly." The enemy shouted.

	Tu Xun sent out a signal, and slogans and military songs rang out together: "Surrender quickly, hand over your guns and we won't kill you. We have you surrounded on all sides!"

	The local tyrant Zhang Zhenguo, seeing that his son had been killed, was so frightened that he trembled all over, and quickly knelt down, raising his hands to surrender to Tu Xun.

	The masses gave lofty honor to the warriors who performed meritorious service for the people. Tu Xun was selected as the first-class combat hero of the battalion. Soon after, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.

	In the spring of 1950, the people of Yunnan longed for the People's Liberation Army as they longed for spring. In order to welcome the elder brother with action, the various units of the Border Column took the initiative to seize the opportunity to eliminate the enemy. In February, a certain unit where Tu Xun was located suddenly heard that a division of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army had arrived at Guanting, so it was decided to use two regiments of troops to annihilate it. Tu Xun's company was in charge of attacking the寨 gate. The battle was extremely fierce from the beginning. Tu Xun led a platoon to launch three assaults, but failed to break into the寨 gate. She began to think: The Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army collapses at the first touch, who are we fighting today that is so tough! Maybe it's the PLA big brother? She suggested to the leadership that she climb to the front to find out. The soldiers were worried that she would encounter an accident if she did so. She said: "It is more important to clarify the situation and reduce losses for the troops than to sacrifice one's own life." Saying this, she risked gunfire, passed through the front line, and climbed into the forest about half a kilometer away from the寨, hearing the opposite side shouting: "We are implementing a lenient policy." Many movements did not seem like the enemy. She quickly climbed back to report to the battalion commander, who suddenly realized: "It may be the PLA big brother." As soon as she heard this, she immediately climbed back to the woods, waving her hand and shouting: "Don't shoot, we are the local guerrillas!" At a distance of about ten meters, her red star cap badge and the short hair exposed outside the hat were discovered by the other party, and the gunfire stopped immediately. A political instructor with a beard ran up and asked with concern and kindness: "Little sister, are you injured?" Tu Xun tightly held the political instructor's hand, and both sides shed tears of emotion.

	Later, Tu Xun was transferred to the Eighth Company as a political instructor. In the new task of suppressing bandits, she used political offensives, closely contacted the masses, and won over dozens of bandits to surrender with their guns. In the forty-day grain carrying campaign, she played a model backbone role and was selected as a labor hero by the entire detachment.

	The people's army cultivated the people's heroes. Today, this twenty-one-year-old female instructor, who has participated in seventeen battles, said modestly when attending the National Congress of Combat Heroes: "My combat experience is as naive as my age. In the year and a half since I joined the army, the Party has led me and the masses have helped me, so that I can bravely fight difficulties and the enemy resolutely. But I have not yet become a modern people's soldier. I have to start learning from scratch in terms of both tactics and political ideology." (Attached picture)

　　游击女英雄涂勋
    曾克　金凤
    一九四九年二月，涂勋是昆明昆华女中的一个学生。昆明的学生运动给了这个来自云南础雄山乡的女学生以初步的政治教育。一天，她突然从报纸上看到蒋匪第二十六军在华宁县盘江南岸屠杀二百多个青年学生的消息。这些青年被杀的罪名，是参加了朱家璧同志领导的云南人民讨蒋自救军。被杀者的鲜血把江水染成一片红。涂勋捧着报纸，双手颤抖着，仿佛报纸上也染满了青年战友的鲜血。“不对，再不去和它拼，我们的人要死光了”，涂勋下了决心。
    一九四九年三月，涂勋已是云南人民讨蒋自救军某部的服务员（半个月后，由中共中央给予该部人民解放军滇桂黔边纵的番号）。
    “要枪，去找敌人！”四街镇有敌人据守，部队决定袭击这个小街镇以夺取敌人的武器来武装自己。
    涂勋向领导上提出要求做一个正式的战斗员，要求参加攻打四街镇的突击队。当领导上考虑到她是一个刚从学校出来的女学生，希望她留在后方时，涂勋急得争辩说：“敌人对我们革命人民的屠杀和凌辱，是不分男人、女人的。我们对敌人的仇恨和反抗，难道就应该受身体条件的阻止和限制吗？”
    她投入了第一次战斗。她清醒、沉着地弯着腰，随着突击队员迅速地攀上树枝，登上围墙，一直冲进四街镇的镇公所。四十多个敌人溃散了，他们获得一千多发子弹的胜利果实。
    部队深入到了敌人的心脏地区活动。曲溪、建九、石屏、龙武的交界有一个重镇名叫阿乌寨。寨上的大恶霸张振国，拚命造谣威胁群众。说是共产党解放了全中国，也进不了他的阿乌寨。
    涂勋所在的连奉命进攻阿乌寨。这时涂勋已升任连副政治指导员，他带着一个突击排前进。向导引着他们从两个山峰中间夹着的陕窄田坝上悄声向寨墙接近，越过外寨，涂勋第一个跳进围墙，机枪手和两个战士也跟着跳了进来。天已经灰麻麻发亮，老百姓桩米和狗叫的声音清脆地在空中振荡，机枪手胆怯起来，和涂勋说：“指导员！敌人要发觉了，抓不到他们多丢脸，还是回去吧。”涂勋纠正他说：“临阵脱逃才最丢脸！”她镇静地把他两人安置到一个厕所里面，然后自己出外引进其他七个战士。这时寨里发觉了，第一声枪打响起来。她仍然镇静地指挥六个战士封锁两个碉堡，两个战士守住围墙，一个封锁后山路。她和机枪手堵住了张振国的大门。远远近近枪声响成一片，大门里猛然闯出一个人来，被机枪手一梭子打死。
    “大哥，大哥！红军大爹来，少爷叫打死了，你快出来。”敌方叫喊成一片。
    涂勋发出了信号，口号、军歌一齐响了起来：“快投降，缴枪不杀，四面都叫我们包围啦！”
    恶霸张振国见儿子已经打死，吓的满身发抖，连忙跪下，举着双手向涂勋投降。
    群众把崇高的荣誉给予为人民立功的勇士。涂勋被选为营的头等战斗英雄。不久又光荣参加了中国共产党。
    一九五○年的春天，云南人民像盼望春天一样盼来了解放大军。为着用行动来欢迎老大哥，边纵各部都主动抓紧战机，消灭敌人。二月，涂勋所在的某部突然听说官亭到了蒋匪军一个师，就决定用两个团的兵力去歼灭它。涂勋的这个连，担任攻打寨门。战斗一开始就进行得异常剧烈。涂勋带着一个排发动三次冲锋，都没有攻进寨门。她心里开始想：蒋匪军都是一碰就垮，今天打的究竟是什么人，这样硬！也许是解放军老大哥吧？她向领导上提议，要爬到最前面去弄个明白。战士们都担心她这样做会遇到意外。她说：“弄清情况使部队少受损失，比自己一个人的生命要重要得多。”说着，她冒着子弹射击，穿过最前线，爬到离寨一里来地的森林里，听见对面在喊：“我们实行宽大政策。”许多动静并不像敌人。她连忙爬回来报告营首长，营首长恍然大悟：“可能是老大哥。”她一听，马上又爬回树林，边爬边招手叫：“不要打枪，我们是地方游击队！”在十公尺左右的地方，她的红星帽徽和露在帽子外面的短发，被对方发现了，枪声立刻停止了。一位长着络腮胡子的教导员跑上来，关心而亲切地问：“小妹妹，你负伤了没有？”涂勋紧紧握住教导员的手，双方流下了感动的热泪。
    以后，涂勋调到八连做政治指导员。在剿匪新任务中，她运用政治攻势，密切联系群众，争取了数十名土匪带枪投诚。四十天的挑粮运动，她起着模范骨干作用，被全支队选为劳动英雄。
    人民的队伍培养出人民的英雄。今天，这位曾经参加了十七次战斗的二十一岁的女指导员，在出席全国战斗英雄代表会议时，谦虚地说：“我的战斗经历是和我的年龄一样幼稚。参军一年半来，党领导我，群众帮助我，才使我能够勇敢地向困难、向敌人作坚决的斗争。但是我还没有成为一个近代化的人民的战士，无论战术和政治思想，我都要从头学起。”（附图片）
