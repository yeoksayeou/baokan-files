Heroic Model Representatives Meet Chairman Mao
    At the opening ceremony of the National Combat Heroes Representatives Conference and the National Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives Conference, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, met with the most outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation—the national heroic model representatives.
    This day—September 25th—will be the most exciting and glorious day that all the heroic models attending the conference will never forget. When Chairman Mao, with a smile on his face, steadily walked into the venue, everyone in the venue naturally stood up to pay their respects. Everyone applauded vigorously and enthusiastically. The applause, accompanied by the music of "The East is Red," continued for a long time. This prolonged applause expressed the heartfelt love and supreme respect of the heroic models for their leader. Iron-willed heroes never shed tears, but at this moment, many people were so excited that they shed tears.
    The heroic models stared at Chairman Mao with their mouths open and eyes wide, reluctant to sit down for a long time. Navy combat hero Sui Shude wiped his eyes again and again, gazing at Chairman Mao. Later, he said, "I want to see clearly, carefully, and go back and tell our naval comrades clearly: Our Chairman Mao is so healthy!" The heroic models felt immense joy at seeing Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in such good health. First Field Army special-class combat hero Lü Shunbao said, "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are so healthy, their health is a great blessing for the Chinese people."
    When Fourth Field Army combat hero Lu Xiqin presented the flag as a representative, he walked to Chairman Mao's side. Many flag-presenting representatives were in front, and he extended his right hand to Chairman Mao. He saw Chairman Mao smile at him, and then immediately grasped his hand. This handshake, although only lasting a few seconds, was, according to combat hero Lu Xiqin, truly a great and eternally unforgettable moment. Through this handshake, he could deeply feel how concerned and loving the people's leader was towards his combat comrades, which increased his infinite courage and strength. Zhao Shiping, a combat hero and flag-presenting representative from the Second Field Army, tightly grasped Chairman Mao's hand, smiling and jumping with joy, as happy as a child. Later, he said anxiously, "Chairman Mao asked me which unit I was from, and I only said the Second Field Army, but I forgot to tell Chairman Mao the words of greeting from the comrades in the company." In order to shake hands with Chairman Mao when presenting the flag, Yu Fuxiang, a combat hero from the Third Field Army, hurriedly removed the plaster cast on his right hand. Zhang Ming, a combat hero from the Third Field Army, said after shaking hands with Chairman Mao, "In the past, when I was wounded in battle, whenever I thought of Chairman Mao, my courage would be inspired. This time, I was able to shake hands tightly with Chairman Mao, which is truly the greatest honor of my life."
    The heroic models gazed at Chairman Mao for a long time. Pu Qingtang, a combat hero from the North China Military Region, said, "I kept my eyes fixed on Chairman Mao's movements, his speech, the way he touched his hair... people presented him with flags, gifts, and flowers, and everyone smiled, and he smiled too." Zhao Peng, a combat hero from the North China Military Region, said, "Seeing Chairman Mao, it's like seeing a mother I haven't seen for many years, so familiar and affectionate!" Militia hero Gao Yuncheng said, "I've wanted to see Chairman Mao for more than ten years. Now that I've seen him, how can I not be happy!" Guo Junqing, a female combat hero from the Fourth Field Army, said, "Seeing Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu has further encouraged my fighting will and increased my fighting strength."
    The heroic models all felt Chairman Mao's greatness. Lü Shunbao, a special-class combat hero from the First Field Army, said, "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are the greatest people's heroes and the greatest people's models! I propose that the Central People's Government should give Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu the highest honor and the title of the greatest people's heroes." All the heroes who met Chairman Mao talked about it: This is something we will never forget in our lives! Chairman Mao has given us the greatest glory!

　　英雄模范代表们见了毛主席
    全国战斗英雄代表会议和全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议开幕典礼上，中国人民伟大的领袖毛主席和中华民族最优秀的儿女——全国的英雄模范代表们见面了。
    这一天——九月二十五日将是所有出席会议的英雄模范们终身不能忘记的最兴奋、最光荣的日子。当毛主席笑容满面的稳步地走进了会场时，会场上的人们都自然地起立致敬，大家使劲地、热烈地鼓掌，掌声伴随着《东方红》的乐声恒久不止。这长久的掌声表现出英雄模范们对自己的领袖由衷的热爱与无上的崇敬。铁打的英雄从不落泪，这时却有好多的人兴奋得流下泪来。
    英雄模范们张着嘴，睁圆眼注视着毛主席，很久很久不肯坐下来。海军战斗英雄隋树德把眼睛擦了又擦，凝视着毛主席，后来他说：“我要看清楚、看仔细，回去好清清楚楚地告诉我们的海军同志们：我们的毛主席是多么的健康啊！”英雄模范们看到毛主席和朱总司令健康的身体，都感到无比的喜悦。一野特等战斗英雄吕顺保说：“毛主席、朱总司令多健康啊，他们的健康就是中国人民的洪福。”
    四野战斗英雄卢锡芹代表献旗时，走到毛主席身旁，很多献旗代表都在前面，他将右手伸到毛主席面前，他看到毛主席对他笑了一笑，然后马上把他的手握了起来。这一握手，虽只是几秒钟的时间，但在战斗英雄卢锡芹说来，真是伟大而恒久不灭的一刹那，通过这一握手，可以深深感觉到人民领袖对战斗同志是如何的关切与热爱，由此增加了他无限的勇气与力量。二野的献旗代表战斗英雄赵世平，在献旗时，紧握着毛主席的手又笑又跳，高兴喜欢得如同小孩子。他后来却发急说：“毛主席问我是那个部队，我只说是第二野战军，可是忘了把连队里同志们嘱托我向毛主席问好的话告诉毛主席了。”三野战斗英雄于复祥为了在献旗时和毛主席握手，急忙地把他右手的石膏绷带解掉。三野战斗英雄张明和毛主席握过手后说：“我过去在作战中负伤时，每当想起了毛主席，我的勇气便鼓起了。这次我能够和毛主席紧紧地握了手，真是我一生最大的光荣。”
    英雄模范们历久地注视着毛主席。华北军区的战斗英雄蒲庆棠说：“我眼睛一点不转动地看着毛主席的动作、说话、用手摸头发，……人们给他献旗、献礼、献花，大家笑，他也笑。”华北军区战斗英雄赵鹏说：“看到毛主席，真像看到了多年不见面的母亲一样，非常熟悉亲热！”民兵英雄高运成说：“我想看毛主席想了十几年了，这回看见了，我怎么不高兴呢！”四野女战斗英雄郭俊卿说：“我看到了毛主席、朱总司令，更鼓舞了我的战斗意志，更增加了我战斗的力量。”
    英雄模范们都感到毛主席的伟大。一野特等战斗英雄吕顺保说：“毛主席、朱总司令才是最伟大的人民英雄、最伟大的人民模范哩！我提议中央人民政府应该给毛主席、朱总司令以最高的荣誉、最伟大的人民英雄的称号。”所有见了毛主席的英雄们都谈论着：这是一辈子忘不了的事啊！毛主席给了我们最大的光荣！
