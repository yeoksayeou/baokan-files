A Book Review:

　　Popular Science Newsletter, Issue 7
    The seventh issue of the "Popular Science Newsletter," compiled and printed by the Central Ministry of Culture's Popular Science Bureau, was published on the 10th. To celebrate the establishment of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, this issue features articles by Liang Xi, Chairman of the Association, titled "The Tasks of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization," as well as articles by Mao Yisheng and Chen Fengtong, Vice Chairmen of the Association, and Zhou Jianren, Cao Richang, and Lu Yudao, members of the Association's National Committee.
    To facilitate the development of grassroots slide projection work in rural areas, this issue has added a "Slide Materials" column, using four-color printed comic strips with the theme of "Maternal Health." Local grassroots slide projectors can readily adopt these.
    In this issue's "Work Experience" column, there is "Summary of Experiences in Coordinating with the Popular Science Bureau's Experimental Work" from Xiyang, and "Combining Propaganda and Treatment" from Zuoquan. The special commentary section includes "The Tasks of Science Popularization in Rural Areas," "Science Popularization and Visitation Surveys." To coincide with the solar eclipse propaganda on September 12th, it publishes a lecture material titled "The Solar Eclipse of September 12, 1950."
