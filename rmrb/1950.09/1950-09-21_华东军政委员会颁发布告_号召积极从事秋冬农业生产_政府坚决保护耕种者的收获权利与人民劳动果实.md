[Shanghai News] In the East China New Area, before the land reform is completed, some lawless landlords are doing everything possible to sabotage production, create various rumors, and provoke relations between farmers to increase farmers' concerns about production. Some farmers, because the landlords' land has not yet been distributed, do not know which land they will be allocated, and fear that if they invest labor and capital, they will not be allocated the land they originally cultivated, and have different concerns about autumn plowing, autumn sowing, and fertilization. To this end, the East China Military and Political Committee issued a proclamation on September 18 regarding the policy on autumn and winter agricultural production in land reform areas this year. The proclamation first stated that protecting the harvesting rights of cultivators and protecting the fruits of the people's labor are the established policies of the People's Government. The proclamation called on the people of all regions to actively engage in autumn and winter agricultural production and stipulated the following policies for the handling of autumn and winter crops in land reform areas this year:

　　In areas scheduled to implement land reform this winter, autumn and winter crops this year will continue to be cultivated according to the principle of "whoever sows, reaps"; or the original cultivators and the land recipients may agree to share the benefits according to the rent reduction standard; or the land recipients shall compensate the original cultivators for all the costs of cultivation and fertilization before the land allocation, in order to facilitate autumn plowing and autumn sowing.

　　In areas where land reform will not be carried out this winter, the rent reduction policy shall be implemented uniformly. Landlords must reduce rent according to the law and must not disobey. After reducing rent according to the law, it is also legal for landlords to collect rent from farmers.

　　On the same day that the Shanghai Jiefang Daily published this proclamation, it also published an editorial entitled "Resolutely Implement the Policy on Autumn and Winter Agricultural Production in Land Reform Areas." The editorial pointed out that the policy announced in the proclamation of the East China Military and Political Committee is the correct policy of protecting the harvesting rights of cultivators, protecting the fruits of the people's labor, and encouraging production. This is the key to ensuring good autumn and winter agricultural production, more cultivation, more planting, and more fertilization in areas implementing land reform this year. People's governments at all levels, Party committees at all levels, and farmers' associations at all levels should widely and deeply publicize and mobilize the content of this proclamation among the peasant masses, so that every household knows it, in order to achieve the goals of more cultivation, more planting, and more fertilization, and to prepare a good foundation for carrying out a large-scale production movement after land reform. In the typical experiments of land reform and in the process of the land reform movement, the leadership should guide the farmers to conduct consultations on the principles of unity, mutual concession, and benefit to production, and adopt different methods to deal with them appropriately according to different situations. For example, if the original cultivator has completed all the cultivation, the method of continuing to cultivate according to the principle of "whoever sows, reaps" can be adopted. If the original cultivator has completed autumn plowing and fertilization and used part of the production capital, and the land recipient is in greater difficulty, the method of mutual consultation and sharing of benefits according to the rent reduction standard can be adopted. If the original cultivator has only used the initial capital for autumn plowing or fertilization, and the land recipient urgently needs to cultivate this newly allocated land, the method of compensating the original cultivator for all the costs of cultivation and fertilization before the land allocation, and then handing over the land and crops to the land recipient for cultivation can be adopted. In short, when dealing with this issue, the principles of unity, mutual concession, and benefit to production should be followed, both protecting the fruits of labor and taking care of the interests of the land recipients; and different methods should be adopted according to different situations, and farmers should be allowed to handle it through self-consultation, and no mandatory mechanical execution should be allowed.

　　The editorial also pointed out that autumn and winter production in areas implementing land reform this year is being carried out in the process of land reform. Therefore, every step of land reform must be closely integrated with and promote this year's autumn and winter production work. We have prepared the conditions for land reform in this year's production movement. Similarly, in the process of our future land reform, we must also complete the task of production well. We must carry out land reform on one hand and production on the other, just as we fought on one hand and carried out land reform on the other in the past. When preparing for land reform, all localities should make plans for increasing production next year and arrange for autumn and winter production this year. At the beginning of land reform in every township (village), arrangements should be made for how to combine it with production, and all possible efforts should be made to save farmers' production time, so as not to delay the farming season. When distributing rural production loans, people's governments in all localities should first pay attention to solving the production difficulties of the poor farmers who have newly obtained land in a planned way. All localities should, without exception, carry out large-scale production mobilization at the end of the land reform stage. We believe that as long as the people's governments and Party committees at all levels can correctly implement the land reform policy and the production policy, carry out meticulous organization and leadership, and rely on the enthusiasm of the broad masses for production, they will surely be able to successfully complete this year's autumn and winter production tasks and lay a solid foundation for increasing agricultural production next year.

　　华东军政委员会颁发布告
    号召积极从事秋冬农业生产
    政府坚决保护耕种者的收获权利与人民劳动果实
    【本报上海讯】华东新区在土地改革未完成之前，有些不法地主，千方百计地破坏生产，制造各种谣言，挑拨农民之间的关系，以增加农民对生产的顾虑。有些农民因为地主的土地尚未分配，不知自己将分到那些土地，怕施了工本分不到原来租种的土地，而对秋耕、秋种、施肥等，怀有不同顾虑。为此，华东军政委员会特于九月十八日颁发土地改革地区今年秋冬农作生产政策的布告。布告首先说明：保护耕种者的收获权利，保护人民劳动果实，乃人民政府的既定政策。布告号召各地人民积极从事秋冬农业生产，并对土地改革地区今年秋冬作物的处理，规定了如下的政策：
    凡预定今冬实行土地改革的地区，今年秋冬作物，仍按谁种谁收原则，继续耕种；或由原耕户与得地户双方协议，按照减租标准分益；或由得地户偿还原耕户在分配土地以前一切耕作与施肥的全部成本，以利秋耕秋种。
    凡今冬不进行土地改革的地区，则一律实行减租政策。地主必须依法减租不得违抗，在依法减租之后，地主向农民收租，也是合法的。
    上海解放日报于刊载这个布告的同一天发表题为“坚决贯彻土地改革地区秋冬农作生产政策”的社论。社论指出：华东军政委员会的布告中宣布的政策是正确的保护耕种者的收获权利、保护人民劳动果实、奖励生产的政策，这是今年实行土地改革的地区，保证作好秋冬农业生产，多耕、多种、多施肥的关键。各级人民政府，各级党委员会，各级农民协会，应将这个布告的内容在农民群众中进行广泛深入的宣传动员，务使家喻户晓，以达多耕、多种、多施肥的目的，为土地改革之后开展大生产运动准备下良好的基础。并在土地改革的典型试验和土地改革运动的过程中，领导农民在团结互让，有利生产的原则下，进行协商，分别不同情况，采取不同办法适当处理。如原耕户已完成全部耕作则可按谁种谁收继续耕种的办法处理。如原耕户已秋耕、施肥并使用了部分的生产工本，而得地户又较困难，则可采取双方协商，按照减租标准分益的办法处理。如原耕户仅使用了秋耕或施肥的初步工本，而得地户又急须耕种此项新分到的土地时，则可采取由得地户偿还原耕户在分配土地以前一切耕作与施肥的全部成本，然后将此项土地及农作物交得地户承接耕种的办法处理。总之，在处理此项问题时，应本团结互让，有利生产，既保护劳动果实，又照顾得地户利益的原则；并应分别情况采取不同的办法，由农民自行协商处理，千万不可强制机械执行。
    社论并指出：今年实行土地改革地区的秋冬季生产，是在土地改革的过程中进行的。因此，土地改革的每一个步骤，必须密切结合和推动今年秋冬季生产工作。我们在今年生产运动中，已准备好了土地改革的条件，同样，我们今后土地改革过程中，也必需很好完成生产的任务。我们要一面土改，一面生产；正如过去一面战斗，一面土改一样。各地在准备土地改革时，就应作好明年增产的计划，布置好今年秋冬的生产。每一个乡（村）在土地改革开始时，都应当把如何结合进行生产安排好，并应尽一切可能节省农民生产时间，以免有误农时，各地人民政府在发放农村生产贷款时，应首先注意有计划地解决新得地的贫苦农民的生产困难。各地在结束土改阶段，应无例外地进行大生产的动员。我们相信，只要各地人民政府与党委领导机关能够端正地执行土改政策与生产政策，进行细密的组织领导，依靠广大群众生产的积极性，必能胜利地完成今年秋冬生产任务，并为明年增加农业生产打下巩固的基础。
