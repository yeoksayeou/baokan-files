　　The All-China Women's Federation Published Two Statements
    Opposing US Imperialist Aggression Against Korea
    Demanding Termination of the Korean War and Withdrawal of All Foreign Troops

    [Reported by this newspaper] The All-China Democratic Women's Federation has recently received a letter of appeal and a statement condemning US imperialist aggression against Korea from the Women's International Democratic Federation. They are published as follows:

  Letter of Appeal from the Women's International Democratic Federation Against US Imperialist Aggression in Korea

    Dear Friends and Sisters:

    The Korean event weighs heavily on the heart of every woman. Every day, the Women's International Democratic Federation receives many letters from all over the world.

    The Women's International Democratic Federation has issued a statement to the United Nations Security Council, which is holding a meeting, severely condemning US imperialist aggression against Korea.

    The Women's International Democratic Federation, representing all women and mothers, expresses its indignation at the brutal acts of US planes bombing peaceful Korean residents—innocent children, defenseless old people, and women.

    We, representing 80 million women united in the Women's International Democratic Federation, demand: the immediate termination of the Korean War and the withdrawal of all foreign troops in Korea.

    Dear friends, women, mothers, and sisters!

    The Women's International Democratic Federation calls on you to work together to strongly support this statement. The bloody crimes of the US in Korea must be stopped immediately.

    The terrified cries of children, the groans of dying mothers and old people, have reached every corner of the world. They die defenseless from the indiscriminate bombing of American bombs, they die from machine-gun fire, they die from the flames of American incendiary bombs, and their homes are burning.

    Sisters and mothers, none of us can be indifferent or sit idly by the pain and suffering of Korean mothers and children. In the last World War, millions of us experienced that kind of pain. We stand wholeheartedly with our Korean sisters.

    Expand and strengthen your demonstrations, send your protests to the United Nations Security Council at Lake Success, demanding an immediate end to the Korean War and the withdrawal of all foreign troops.

    Return Korea to the Korean people!

    Give peace to the homes of Korean mothers!

    Give Korean children survival and happiness!

  Statement by the Women's International Democratic Federation Condemning US Aggression Against Korea

    The Women's International Democratic Federation, representing 80 million women in 59 countries, strongly condemns the US aggression against Korea. Every member of the Women's International Democratic Federation recognizes that all nations have the sacred right to self-determination and to decide their destiny according to their own wishes. The US government's aggression against Korea most brutally violates this legitimate right. This is a mockery and a wanton trampling of the principle of equal rights for all nations, large and small, solemnly declared in the United Nations Charter.

    The Women's International Democratic Federation expresses its anger at the series of atrocities committed by US troops in Korea—the insane bombing of defenseless peaceful residents, the old, the weak, women, and children, in cities and villages by US planes, the arbitrary burning of entire residential areas, and the massacres of peaceful residents by US troops during their retreat. These acts are heinous crimes not only against the Korean people but against all humanity.

    The Women's International Democratic Federation is particularly outraged that this criminal aggression and the shameless atrocities of the US in Korea are being carried out under the cover of the United Nations flag.

    The Women's International Democratic Federation, representing the will of 80 million women in 59 countries, demands:

    Immediately end the Korean War!

    Withdraw all foreign troops!

    Let the Korean people handle their own affairs. This is their right, just as it is the right of all other nations in the world!

    The Women's International Democratic Federation calls on the Security Council to restore the principles declared in the United Nations Charter, according to which the Security Council, as an organization entrusted with maintaining world peace and security, is possible and must stop the bloody crimes in Korea.

　　国际民主妇联发表两项声明
    反对美帝国主义侵略朝鲜
    要求终止朝鲜战争撤退一切外国军队
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会顷收到国际民主妇女联合会为反对美帝侵略朝鲜的呼吁书及谴责美帝侵略朝鲜的声明两文，兹发表如下：
  国际民主妇女联合会为反对美帝侵略朝鲜的呼吁书亲爱的朋友们和姊妹们：
    朝鲜事件重压着每个妇女的心，每天国际民主妇联都收到许多从世界各地寄来的信件。
    国际民主妇联已向正在举行会议的联合国安理会发出声明，严斥美帝侵略朝鲜。
    国际民主妇联代表全体妇女和母亲，对美机狂炸朝鲜和平居民——无辜的儿童，无防卫的老人和妇女——的惨酷行为表示愤慨。
    我们代表团结在国际民主妇联下的八千万妇女要求：立即终止朝鲜战争并撤退在朝鲜的一切外国军队。
    亲爱的朋友们，妇女们，母亲们和姊妹们！
    国际民主妇联号召你们共同努力，对这声明作强有力的支援，美帝在朝鲜的血腥罪行必须立刻予以制止。
    孩子们恐怖的呼声，垂死的母亲们和老人们的呻吟，传到了世界上每一个角落，他们毫无自卫力量地死于美国炸弹狂炸中，他们死于机关枪的扫射下，他们死于美国的燃烧弹的火焰中，他们的家正在燃烧着。
    姊妹们和母亲们，对于朝鲜母亲们和儿童们的痛苦和灾难，我们中间没有一个人能够无动于中，或坐视不顾。在上次世界大战中，我们中间千百万人都曾经历过那种痛苦。我们全心全意地和朝鲜姊妹们站在一起。
    扩大和加强你们的示威运动，向成功湖联合国安理会提出你们的抗议，要求立刻终止朝鲜战争并撤退一切外国军队。
    把朝鲜还给朝鲜人民！
    给朝鲜的母亲们的家以和平！
    给朝鲜儿童们以生存与幸福！
  国际民主妇女联合会谴责美国侵略朝鲜的声明
    国际民主妇女联合会代表五十九个国家的八千万妇女严厉谴责美国对朝鲜的侵略。国际民主妇女联合会每一个会员都承认一切民族都有自决和依照他们自己的愿望来决定他们的命运的神圣权利。美国政府对朝鲜的侵略最野蛮地侵犯了这个合法的权利，这是对联合国宪章所郑重宣布的各大小民族具有平等权利的原则的讽刺和肆无忌惮的蹂躏。
    国际民主妇联对美军在朝鲜所犯的一连串暴行——美机对城市和乡村中并无防御的和平居民、老弱妇孺的疯狂轰炸，对整个住宅区的任意焚毁，以及美军在撤退时对和平居民的集体屠杀——表示愤怒。这些行为不仅是对朝鲜人民而且是对全人类的万恶罪行。
    国际民主妇联尤其深感愤慨的，是这种罪恶的侵略和美国在朝鲜的无耻暴行却是在联合国的蓝旗掩护下进行的。
    国际民主妇联代表五十九国的八千万妇女的意志要求：
    立刻终止朝鲜战争！
    撤退一切外国军队！
    让朝鲜人民处置他们自己的事，这是他们的权利，正如这是世界上其他一切民族的权利一样！
    国际民主妇联号召安理会恢复联合国宪章所宣布的原则，根据这些原则，作为一个被委为负责维持全世界和平和安全的机构的安全理事会是可能而且必须制止在朝鲜的血腥罪行。
