　　Labor Model Representative, Ruler Algorithm Inventor
    Yu Zhendong Thanks the Communist Party and Chairman Mao for Their Training
    [Our Newspaper] Yu Zhendong, a representative attending the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers and the inventor of the ruler algorithm, sent a letter to this newspaper expressing his gratitude for the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party and for their training of him. He also stated the direction of his future efforts. The original letter is as follows:
People's Daily Editorial Department:
    My name is Yu Zhendong. I am from Wuan Village, Qingyuan County, Hebei Province. I am a poor peasant and carpenter by origin. Because I recognized that the Communist Party leads us workers to stand up and serves our people, I joined the revolutionary work in 1931. Through the Party's long-term training and education, I was able to preliminarily complete the invention of the ruler algorithm and the research of the water extraction machine. I am currently studying at Beiyang University, researching mathematics and mechanical principles; and conducting further research on the ruler algorithm and the water extraction machine.
    Today, I was selected as a representative of the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers, and I feel very honored and excited. I thank Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. Without Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the Chinese Communist Party leading the Chinese people to achieve unprecedented victory, we would not have what we have today.
    I was selected as a labor model representative this time because the masses based their decision on my deeds in the following three aspects. I will briefly explain them here:
    First, I am a poor peasant and carpenter by origin. After many years of hard work and research, I invented the ruler algorithm under the Party's training and was praised as "China's Ruler Algorithm Inventor." I personally believe that this glorious title is the result of the Communist Party and the people's cultivation, it is the glory of the Party, and it is also the glory of our working class.
    Second, in the struggle against the "mopping-up" operations, I worked as an intelligence officer in the countryside and actively took the lead in production and transporting public grain, and was awarded the glorious title of labor hero.
    Third, while working as an intelligence officer, I was captured by the enemy twice. The first time I was imprisoned in Baoding, and the enemy could not get any results from torture. The second time I was captured in my village, and the enemy interrogated me about my identity and the situation of the Eighth Route Army. With the determination to die, I endured the Japanese puppet's cruel torture and passed out several times, but I never confessed anything. The enemy forced the village to prepare a cart and stretcher to take me away, but the people in the village had been educated by the Communist Party and had a high degree of awareness, and no one would do it. The enemy had no choice but to leave me. At this time, the Party sent a doctor to treat me. After the injuries were healed, I participated in the Third Column and taught the ruler algorithm artillery range calculation course.
    The people have given me unlimited glory for these deeds in my past work, but in fact, this is the result of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party's teachings. In the future, I will do my work with infinite loyalty to repay the Party and our people's leader.
    Therefore, I have these things to do in the future:
    First, work hard to learn and research humbly, continue to improve my professional level, and enthusiastically teach and help others.
    Second, continue to complete the revolutionary struggle, first of all, resolutely engage in any work to liberate Taiwan, and from now on, we should call on and mobilize the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to complete this great mission.
    Third, learn from the heroic struggle of the Korean people against American imperialism, educate ourselves, educate the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, arouse hatred for American imperialism; and enhance solidarity with the Soviet Union and all people's democratic countries and all peace-loving people in the world.
      Yu Zhendong, Representative of the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants, and Soldiers

　　劳模代表、尺算法发明家
    于振善感谢共产党和毛主席的培养
    【本报讯】出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表、尺算法发明家于振善致函本报，表示感谢毛主席和中国共产党的英明领导和对他的培养。并说出自己今后努力的方向。原信如下：人民日报编辑部：
    我叫于振善，是河北省清苑县武安村人，是一个贫农兼木匠出身。由于认识了共产党是领导我们工人翻身，是为我们人民办事的，所以，在一九三一年即参加了革命工作。在党的长期培养、教育中，使我能初步完成了尺算法的发明和挤水机的研究。现时我正在北洋大学学习，研究数学及机械原理；并对尺算法和挤水机作进一步的研究。
    今天，我被选为全国工农兵劳模代表，感到十分光荣和兴奋。我感谢毛主席，感谢中国共产党。如果没有毛主席的英明领导，没有中国共产党领导中国人民获得空前胜利，我们是不会有今天的。
    我这次被选为劳模代表，群众是根据我在以下三方面的事迹决定的。我在这里简单说一下：
    第一、我是一个贫农兼木匠出身，经过多年努力钻研，在党的培养中发明了尺算法，被誉为“中国尺算法发明家”。我个人认为，这个光荣称号，是共产党和人民培养的结果，是党的光辉，也是我们工人阶级的光辉。
    第二、在反“扫荡”斗争中，我在农村里担任情报员工作，还积极带头生产，输送公粮，得到过劳动英雄的光荣称号。
    第三、在担任情报员工作中，被敌人捕去两次，第一次在保定坐监，敌人拷问不出结果来。第二次是在我村被捕，敌人拷问我的身份和八路军情况，我以必死的决心，忍受着日伪的毒刑拷打，死过去好几次，始终没有口供。敌人强迫村里要套车担架把我捕走，村中人民是受过共产党教育的，有着相当高的觉悟程度，没有一个人去做这事。敌人只好扔下我。这时，党派了医生来为我医疗。伤治好后，我又参加三纵队教授尺算法炮弹射程计算课程。
    我个人在过去工作当中有这一点事迹，人民就给予我无限光荣，事实上这是毛主席和共产党教导我的结果。今后，我将以无限忠诚做好工作，来报答党和我们人民的领袖。
    因此，我在今后有这几件事要作：
    第一、努力虚心学习和钻研，继续提高本身业务水平，并热心教授和帮助别人。
    第二、继续完成革命斗争，首先是坚决从事解放台湾的任何工作，并从现在起，我们就应该在工农兵广大群众中间号召、发动，以期完成这个伟大使命。
    第三、从朝鲜人民反抗美帝的英勇斗争中，教育自己，教育广大的工农兵群众，激发对美帝国主义的仇恨；增强对苏联和各人民民主国家及世界上一切爱好和平的人民的团结。
      全国工农兵劳模代表会议代表于振善
              九月二十六日
