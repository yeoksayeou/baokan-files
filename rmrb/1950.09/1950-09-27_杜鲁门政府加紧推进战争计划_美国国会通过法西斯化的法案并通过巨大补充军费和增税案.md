　　Xinhua News Agency, September 26th:
　　A political bill that turns the United States into an open police state has been finally passed into law by an overwhelming majority of both parties in the US Congress. According to the United States Information Service in Washington, before the congressional recess on September 23rd, the US House and Senate passed again on the 22nd and 23rd respectively a bill aimed at outlawing the Communist Party and other progressive groups to facilitate war measures. This bill, called the "Internal Security Act of 1950," was drafted by both houses of Congress based on Truman's request to Congress on August 8th to strengthen police rule. During the passage of the bill in both houses, it combined various fascist proposals put forward by members of both parties, including compulsory registration of all Communist Party members and all members of organizations deemed "Communist fronts" by a three-person committee appointed by the President, denial of passports to "Communists," detention of all Communist Party members in the event of "war, invasion, and rebellion," and the ability to sentence victims to ten years of imprisonment for so-called un-American activities.
　　As a result of the final action by both houses of Congress, this darkest anti-democratic legislation in American history will become permanent law. However, this fascist persecution bill has not frightened the progressive people of the United States. In a statement issued by the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States after the Senate finally passed the bill, it pointed out: "Any effort to implement this evil law will inevitably arouse a more resolute and united resistance from the American people."

　　Xinhua News Agency, September 25th:
　　The US Congress has passed Truman's huge supplementary military appropriation aimed at expanding the war of aggression, and at the same time decided to increase taxes substantially for this purpose. According to the United States Information Service in Washington, the House and Senate passed on the 22nd a military appropriation bill totaling 17 billion US dollars, which Truman had successively submitted to Congress after provoking the Korean War. According to Truman's proposal, this appropriation is mainly required to expand the US armed forces and purchase military equipment, of which 4 billion will be used for military "aid" to foreign countries, distributed as follows: 3.504 billion US dollars to Western European NATO countries; 193 million US dollars to Greece, Turkey, and Iran; and 303 million US dollars to Southeast Asia and the Philippines. The bill has been sent to Truman for signature. An amendment to the bill, drafted by the House and passed by the Senate, also stipulates that "during any period in which the US armed forces are usurping the name of the United Nations to engage in combat operations," as long as the National Security Council believes that trade between any country and the Soviet Union, China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and other people's democratic countries "conflicts with the security interests of the United States," the "aid" to that country will be cancelled. This provision is clearly an attempt to threaten its vassal states with the cancellation of funds such as the Marshall Plan, to make them more obediently cater to the US imperialist war policy.
　　On the same day, the US Congress passed a tax increase bill to squeeze funds for the Truman administration's military expansion plan. According to the Associated Press, the new tax rate increases individual income tax by 20 percent. This levy, mainly added to wages and salary income, will provide most of the 4.7 billion in new taxes. The tax rate on corporate income, which has been making unprecedented profits under the war plan, will only increase from 38 percent to 45 percent. The new tax law was quickly signed by Truman the next day and will be implemented within a week. As a result, the already heavily burdened American working people will further reduce their living standards.

　　杜鲁门政府加紧推进战争计划
    美国国会通过法西斯化的法案并通过巨大补充军费和增税案
    【新华社二十六日讯】使美国成为公开的警察国家的政治法案，已经美国国会两党压倒多数最后通过成为法律。据美国新闻处华盛顿消息，美国众院及参院在九月二十三日国会休会前，于二十二、二十三两日先后再次通过了旨在取缔共产党及其他进步团体以便于推进战争措施的法案。这个名为“一九五○年国内安全法”的法案，系两院根据杜鲁门于八月八日向国会提出的加强警察统治的要求制定的。该案在两院通过中，结合了两党议员所提出的各种法西斯建议，包括强制一切共产党员和其他一切凡由总统所任命的三人委员会列为所谓共产党“外围”组织的成员进行登记，不给“共产党人”以出国护照，在发生“战争、侵略和叛乱”时，拘禁一切共产党员，并得以所谓从事非美活动的罪名，对被迫害者判处十年徒刑。
    由于国会两院的最后行动，这项美国历史上最黑暗的反民主立法，将成为永久性的法律。但是，这一法西斯的迫害法案，并没有吓唬住美国进步人民。美国共产党全国委员会在参院最后通过该法后发表的声明中指出：“任何把这一罪恶法律付诸实施的努力，将不可避免地引起美国人民更坚决和更团结的反抗。”
    【新华社二十五日讯】美国国会已通过杜鲁门目的在扩大侵略战争的巨大补充军事拨款，同时决定为此大量增税。据美国新闻处华盛顿消息，众院和参院于二十二日先后通过了杜鲁门于挑起朝鲜战争后陆续向国会提出的总数达一百七十亿美元的扩军拨款法案。按杜鲁门所提这项拨款，要求主要用于扩大美国武装部队和添置军备，而其中有四十亿用于对外国的军事“援助”，其分配如下：西欧北大西洋公约国家三十五亿零四百万美元；希腊、土耳其和伊朗一亿九千三百万美元；东南亚和菲律宾三亿零三百万美元。法案已送杜鲁门签署。由众院制定而经参院通过的该案修正案并规定：在美国武装部队僭窃联合国的名义“从事作战行动的任何期间”，只要全国安全委员会认为任一国家与苏联、中国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以及其他人民民主国家之间的贸易，“与美国的安全利益有冲突”，就取消对该国的“援助”。这项规定显然企图以取消马歇尔计划之类的经费，要胁其仆从国家更驯服地迎合美国的帝国主义战争政策。
    美国国会于同日通过了一项增税法案，为杜鲁门政府的扩军方案压榨经费。据美联社报道，新税率使个人所得税增加百分之二十。这项主要加于工资及薪水收入的课征，将提供四十七亿新税的大部分。在推进战争计划下获得空前暴利的公司的所得税，其税率将仅自百分之三十八增至百分之四十五。新税法经杜鲁门于次日迅即签署，并将于一星期内付诸实施，其结果将使负担本已很重的美国劳动人民，进一步降低其生活水平。
