　　Beijing Construction Bureau's Three Road Engineering Teams
    Complete the Glorious Task of the Boulevard
    [Reported by this newspaper] All staff members of the First, Second, and Third Engineering Teams of the Road Engineering Office of the Beijing Construction Bureau, after completing the task of building the asphalt road on the east-west Chang'an Avenue boulevard in the capital, wrote a report to Chairman Mao. The original letter is as follows: Respected Chairman Mao:
    Our Construction Bureau Road Engineering Team is honored to be undertaking the construction work of the capital. This June, we received the most glorious and meaningful great task - constructing the asphalt road for the boulevard on east-west Chang'an Avenue. All staff members felt unparalleled excitement.
    In the work, we encountered many difficulties: much rain, much water, many obstacles, and many areas of roadbed softening, especially in the eastern section, where the roadbed was softening everywhere. It was the most difficult road to repair in the past two years. But when we thought of this being the glorious task you gave us, our courage was boosted again. Everyone came up with ideas to dig out the softened mud, fill it with more than 500 cubic meters of broken bricks and more than 1,000 cubic meters of stones, and as a result, we overfulfilled the task and presented it to you as a gift to welcome the first anniversary of the founding of the country on October 1st, allowing the tens of thousands of troops inspected by you on that day to pass smoothly. We felt very honored.
    In the work, many labor models emerged. Our work attitude surprised the onlookers. Only under your leadership can our workers have such performance. We will continue to strive for the construction tasks of the capital. We wish you good health!
        Respectfully from all staff members of the First, Second, and Third Engineering Teams of the Road Engineering Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Bureau
              September 15th
