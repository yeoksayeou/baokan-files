    Many Wasteful Phenomena Discovered

    [Our Newspaper] Heilongjiang Provincial Public Trading Company, according to the Provincial Department of Commerce's "Instructions on Launching a Waste Inspection Campaign," formed a county inspection committee to lead the inspection work. After ten days, it was discovered that various losses and waste amounted to more than 2 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). These losses were mainly caused by the blind instructions of the provincial company regarding allocation and procurement work, as well as the Taian Trading Company's own lack of planning in its work, poor storage, and waste of transportation costs and expenses. For example, from the third quarter of last year to the second quarter of this year, the Heilongjiang Provincial Company allocated materials that did not meet the needs of the local people, such as gas, glass, floral corduroy, rubber shoes, and gray-blue fine cloth, resulting in a waste of 20 million yuan in round-trip transportation costs. Furthermore, regarding the purchase of live pigs, losses occurred due to poor feeding and the outbreak of infectious diseases resulting in death; after purchasing eggs, the provincial company instructed that they be sold at reduced prices locally, resulting in another loss of more than 900 million yuan. Other wastes, such as poor storage, deterioration and damage to materials, and construction that was unsuitable and then reworked, also resulted in significant losses.

    In order to avoid the recurrence of the above-mentioned losses, the company decided to organize a permanent inspection team to conduct in-depth inspections of the work at any time. It also proposed to regularly solicit rationalization proposals from employees to continuously improve the work, strengthen the planning of the work, gradually move towards economic accounting, and strengthen capital turnover.

　　黑龙江省泰安贸易公司
    检查出不少浪费现象
    【本报讯】黑龙江省泰公贸易公司，根据该省商业厅“关于开展检查浪费运动”的指示，组成了县检查委员会，领导检查工作。经过十天期间，共检查出各种损失浪费达二十余亿元（东北币，下同）。这些损失，主要是省公司对于划拨与采购工作的盲目指示，及泰安贸易公司本身工作无计划，保管不善，运费和开支的浪费等所造成。如从去年第三季度到今年第二季度中，黑龙江省公司曾拨去瓦斯，玻璃，花贡呢，胶皮鞋，灰蓝细布等不合当地人民需用物资，结果退回往返浪费运费二千万元。又如收购活猪，因饲养不良，发生传染病而死亡；收购鸡蛋后，省公司又指示在当地削价销售，共又损失九亿余元。其他如保管不善，物资变质损坏，修建不合用又反工等浪费，损失亦很大。
    为了避免再发生以上各种损失，该公司决定组织常期性检查小组，随时深入检查工作。又提出要经常吸取职工合理化建议，以不断改进工作，并加强工作的计划性，逐渐步入经济核算制，加强资金周转。    （子光、学富）
