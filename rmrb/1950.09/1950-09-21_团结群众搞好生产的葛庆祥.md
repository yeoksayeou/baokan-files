Ge Qingxiang is the second foreman (second-in-charge) of the 5996 team at the Zhaogezhuang Coal Mine in Kailuan, Tangshan. He possesses excellent skills and abundant experience. He always discusses matters with everyone and patiently educates backward workers. He always takes the lead in dangerous work, and when there are special tasks, he explains them carefully to the workers and earnestly studies them with everyone. Under his leadership, all the workers in the team are very united. In this year's "Red May" production competition in Tangshan, he created a new coal mining record for the entire mine – increasing production from 6.5 containers per shift to 10 containers.

He is good at careful calculation, such as the condition of the old tunnels, the amount of time for rework, the amount of work that needs to be done in dead ends, and how to coordinate tunneling and extraction. His estimates are very accurate, so the team's coal production has always been balanced.

Ge Qingxiang is alert and cautious, and he doesn't panic in the face of trouble. During the "Red May" competition, once the supports under the platform of the first chute collapsed, and it looked like the platform was about to collapse. There was no material to build temporary supports, and there wasn't time to repair it. If it collapsed, it would delay the coal output for three shifts. Ge immediately came up with a solution: using old iron slides instead of wooden supports, preventing the platform from collapsing and avoiding production delays. Another time, the car in the seventh chute broke, and there was no way to repair it immediately. It looked like it would hinder coal output. So, Ge Qingxiang, with the help of two workers, carried the car from the next chute over, allowing production to continue. He usually has a clear understanding of all parts of the team, and he anticipates where accidents might occur and finds ways to prevent them in advance. Therefore, the workers are all willing to work on his team. The workers said, "With our Lao Ge at the helm, it's great to work on the team! He makes sure you're safe in every direction, above, below, and all around. When you're digging coal, you just need to put more effort into it. He knows exactly what the slope should be, so you don't waste any energy."

Lao Ge's production enthusiasm began to develop after the liberation of Tangshan the year before. In the past, he said, "The Japanese devils (referring to the Japanese invaders) gave us bean cakes and corn flour; when the Kuomintang came, they still gave us bran and moldy red grain. I've seen through it, working hard is useless!" After liberation, Lao Ge felt heartbroken every time he thought about the past, saying, "Ah! We've finally made it through. An umbrella without ribs can't be opened; without the Communist Party, who would save us!" He became more and more responsible for production every day. Since the Tangshan "Red May" production competition, his enthusiasm has been even greater. During the competition, he goes to the mine early every day to install lights and thoroughly inspects everywhere in the mine. After the workers arrive, he assigns work based on the inspection results, telling everyone the coal mining route for the day and immediately starting work. After work starts, he works just like the other workers, challenging the workers to compete. After work, the entire team holds a meeting to review the work and study the team's situation, soliciting workers' opinions on the work. At the beginning of the "Red May" competition, he discussed and established a public pledge with everyone, motivating everyone's production enthusiasm and using it as a goal for the competition. At the same time, he actively challenged other teams. In this way, under the unity and leadership of Lao Ge, the 5996 team only missed two shifts in the forty-five-day competition, consistently maintaining three shelves of seven-foot kilns per day, increasing production from 6.5 containers per shift to 10 containers per shift, creating the highest new record for the entire mine. In the "Red May" model worker evaluation, he was selected as a special-class model worker in Tangshan and was evaluated by Tangshan City as a representative to attend the National Labor Model Conference.

　　团结群众搞好生产的葛庆祥
    赵森
    葛庆祥是唐山开滦赵各庄矿井下五九九六?的二工（二头子），技术好、经验多。有事就和大家商量，更能耐心地教育落后工友。危险的工作总是自己先去，有了特殊活儿时，细心给工友解说，认真和大家研究。在他的领导下，全?工友团结得很好。在今年唐山市红五月生产竞赛中，创造了全矿的采煤新纪录——由过去的每工六罐半提高到十罐。
    他善于精心计算，如老塘情况如何？回作时间多少？死处应作多少？怎样使掘进与回采互相配合等，他估计的都非常恰当，所以该?的煤产量始终能够保持平衡。
    葛庆祥机警谨慎，遇事不着慌。红五月竞赛中，有一次头道顺槽台棚下的棚子坍了，眼看台棚就要坍下。一时打木垛没材料，修理又来不及，若坍下来就要耽误三个班的出煤。葛头马上想出了办法，用旧铁溜子代替木垛，使台棚免于倒坍，没有耽误生产。又一次，七道顺槽的斗子坏了，一时无法修理，眼看就要妨碍出煤，于是葛庆祥在两个工人帮助下，将下道顺槽的车背了来，使生产继续下去。他平时对?内各处都了解得很清楚，什么地方可能发生事故，预先就设法防止了。因之工友们都愿在他?上作活，工友们说：“有了咱老葛这把舵的，在?上干活可带劲啦！四面八方头顶脚下，他早给你保上险，刨煤时只要你胳膊多加点油就行，开拓坡度多少全有个准，管叫你不使冤枉气力。”
    老葛的生产积极性的发挥是从前年唐山解放后开始的。在以前，他自己说：“小鼻子（指日寇）给咱吃豆饼、玉黍面；来了国民党还是发糠秕、霉红粮。我算看透了，干活多也是白搭！”解放后老葛每回想起过去，就心酸的说：“唉！这算是盼出头了，没骨的伞是支不开，没有共产党谁来救咱！”他对生产一天比一天的更加负责，唐山红五月生产竞赛以来，他的劲头更大。在竞赛中每天提早进矿支灯，到井下各处检查得很周到，工友到齐后就根据检查的情况分配工作，告诉大家当天采煤路线，立即开工。开工后自己和工友一样干活，和工友们挑战竞赛。下班后全班工友开一次会，检讨工作并研究本班情况，征求工友对工作的意见。在红五月竞赛开始时，他就和大家商订了个公约，发动起大家的生产积极性，并以此作为竞赛的目标。同时还积极向别?挑战。这样，五九九六?在老葛的团结和带动下，四十五天的竞赛中只脱了两个班，一直保持了每天七尺窑棚三架子，产量由过去每工六点五罐增达每工十罐，创全矿最高新纪录。红五月评模中他被评选为唐山市级特等模范，并由唐山市评为出席全国劳模大会的代表。
