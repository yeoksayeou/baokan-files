Xinhua News Agency, September 23rd: The Central Flood Control Headquarters today instructed water conservancy authorities and flood control agencies in all regions to lead local people in accelerating breach closure, drainage, and wheat planting. The full text of the instruction is as follows:

	Currently, except for individual rivers and regions, the flood season has passed. All areas affected by breaches and waterlogging should immediately and vigorously carry out breach closure and drainage work, striving to plant as much wheat as possible. In areas expected to be affected by floods again next year, drainage should be completed in a concentrated manner to achieve the goal of "one flood, one wheat crop."

	In carrying out this work, breach closure should be carefully planned, materials should be fully prepared, and pile work, fascine work, and earthwork should be closely coordinated. At the same time, waste and delays should be opposed. In terms of drainage, the principle of "minor interests subordinate to major interests" should be implemented, appropriately taking care of minor interests and paying timely attention to resolving potential disputes. For areas with perennial waterlogging, long-term plans should be made if conditions for drainage are met, and attention should be paid to the preservation of drainage ditches and the construction of culverts and sluice gates.

	The required funds should be determined based on the specific circumstances of each region, decided by the benefiting masses to bear, or the government may provide appropriate subsidies, and reported to higher-level authorities in a timely manner.

　　中央防汛总指挥部指示水灾区
    加紧堵口排水大量种麦
    【新华社二十三日讯】中央防汛总指挥部今日指示各地水利主管机关和防汛机构，领导当地人民加紧进行堵口排水种麦工作。指示全文如下：
    目前除个别河流个别地区外，汛期已经过去。所有溃决成灾和积水致涝的地方，应即迅速大力进行堵口排水工作，争取多多种麦，尤其估计明年可能仍受洪水灾害的地方，更应对于当地的排水突击完成，以期达到一水一麦的要求。
    在进行这一工作中，堵口应注意周密计划，物料要充分准备，桩工埽工与土工要密切配合，同时反对浪费与拖延。排水方面应贯彻小利服从大利的原则，适当地照顾小利，及时注意解决可能发生的纠纷。常年积水成灾地区，具备可以排出的条件者，要作长期打算。注意泄水沟之保留与涵闸的修建。
    所需经费，应根据各地具体情况，决定由受益群众负担，或由政府酌予补助，及时呈报上级机关。
