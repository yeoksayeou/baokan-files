    Xinhua News Agency, New York, September 22nd: The United Nations General Assembly continued its general debate on the afternoon of September 21st. The Iraqi representative, Jamali, spoke first. In a lengthy speech, Jamali put forward a plan supposedly intended to improve the "extremely critical" international situation, as he called it.

    Strangely enough, however, Jamali's proposals for promoting peace included a suggestion to abolish the principle of great power unanimity in the Security Council, a principle that is the foundation of the UN Charter, whose duty it is to maintain world peace. In addition, Jamali suggested a "truce of ideas" based on "mutual tolerance"; he spoke of abolishing racial discrimination and of financial and technical assistance for developing backward countries. At the same time, Jamali expressed support for the American aggression in Korea and vehemently attacked Israel, saying that Israel brutally mistreated the Palestinian Arabs. He expressed the hope that France would grant independence to its North African colonies.

    The next speaker, the New Zealand representative, Berendsen, in his lengthy and provocative speech, welcomed the American aggression in Korea and greatly slandered the Soviet Union. Berendsen supported the American proposal to establish an aggressive army under the banner of the United Nations, and attacked the principle of great power unanimity in the Security Council.

    The Australian representative, Spender, who spoke next, also expressed support for the American proposals, the purpose of which is to undermine the principles of the United Nations and to establish an aggressive international army under the control of the United States, but flying the UN flag. Spender slandered the Soviet Union, claiming that the Soviet Union was trying to undermine the effectiveness of the United Nations as a tool for maintaining security.

    Spender echoed Acheson's speech, saying: "We must explore the possibility of modifying the procedures of the General Assembly so that we can rapidly mobilize the military and industrial resources of peace-loving countries to maintain peace in the event of aggression."

    The Honduran representative, Gálvez, gave a brief speech, the content of which was vague and empty. He said that "it is not too late" to resolve conflicts within this "truly universal institution" by "taking advantage of this last opportunity."

    The Guatemalan representative, Arévalo, reiterated his support for the Security Council's illegally passed resolutions on the Korean issue. He also pointed out that the colonial system is still the root cause of conflict in many parts of the world. Arévalo demanded recognition of Guatemala's territorial claims to Belize, which is still under British rule. He strongly opposed placing the reconsideration of relations with Franco's Spain on the agenda. He emphasized that the General Assembly's 1946 resolution had condemned Franco as the last stronghold of fascism, and he warned that the General Assembly's current change of attitude would be a heavy blow to democracy. He added that the General Assembly's change of attitude could only discredit itself.

    The last speaker was the Greek representative, Kanellopoulos, whose speech echoed American propaganda.

    The next plenary session will be held on September 23.

　　美仆从国代表在联大发言
    竟企图废除大国一致原则
    并支持美国对朝鲜的侵略冒险
    【新华社讯】塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：九月二十一日下午，联合国大会全体会议继续进行一般辩论，伊拉克代表贾马利首先发言。贾马利在冗长的演说中提出一项方案，据说该方案是打算用来改进贾马利所谓“极端危急”的国际局势。
    但是，很奇怪，贾马利的增进和平的建议中，却包括有废除安理会大国一致原则的建议，而这条原则乃是以保持世界和平为职责的联合国宪章的基础。此外，贾马利还建议在“互相忍让”的基础上实行“思想上的停战”；他谈到废除种族歧视以及开发落后国家的财政与技术上的援助等。贾马利同时表示支持美国侵略朝鲜，并猛烈地攻击以色列，说以色列横暴地虐待巴勒斯坦的阿拉伯人。他表示希望法国给北非殖民地以独立。
    继起发言的新西兰代表比林德森在其冗长的挑衅性的演说中，表示欢迎美国在朝鲜的侵略；并且大事诽谤中伤苏联。比林德森支持美国关于在联合国招牌下建立侵略性军队的建议，并且攻击安理会中大国一致的原则。
    澳大利亚代表斯宾德继起发言，也表示支持美国的建议，这些建议的目的都在于破坏联合国原则，并建立打着联合国旗子、但受美国控制的侵略性国际军队。斯宾德对苏联进行诽谤，硬说苏联力图破坏联合国作为维持安全之工具的效能。
    斯宾德附和艾奇逊的演说，他说：“我们必须探究修改大会程序的可能性，以便能在侵略事件发生时迅速动员爱好和平国家的军事与工业资源来保持和平。”
    洪都拉斯代表加里阿士发表简短的演说，内容含糊空洞。他说：“利用这最后一次机会”在这个“真正具有普遍性质的机构”范围内解决冲突，“为时还不太晚”。
    危地马拉代表阿瑞维罗重申他支持安理会非法通过的关于朝鲜问题的决定。他还提出，殖民制度在世界上许多地方仍然是引起冲突的根源。阿瑞维罗要求承认危地马拉对仍在英国统治之下的百里斯的领土要求。他坚决反对将重新考虑与佛朗哥西班牙的关系问题列入议程。他强调指出大会一九四六年的决议已斥责佛朗哥为法西斯主义的最后一个据点，他警告说：大会目前改变态度会成为对民主制度的一个沉重的打击。他又说：大会改变态度只能自贬威信。
    最后一个发言的是希腊代表坎奈劳波勒斯，他的演说附和美国宣传的说法。
    下一次全体会议将于九月二十三日举行。
