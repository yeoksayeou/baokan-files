Fighting on the Canal Embankment
    ——A Record of the People Along the Northern Jiangsu Canal Overcoming This Year's First Flood Peak
    Qiao Yunzhu, Zheng Changhong, Wu Yousong

The canals of Northern Jiangsu are connected to Hongze Lake, Baoying Lake, and Gaoyou Lake. In July of this year, as the floodwaters from the Huai River successively converged into Hongze Lake, the Northern Jiangsu canal embankment faced a serious flood threat.

On July 21st, the Northern Jiangsu People's Administrative Office held an emergency meeting on flood control for the canal, deciding to make "ensuring the safety of the canal embankment and the Hongze Lake dam, and consolidating the Yi embankment (i.e., the Xin Yi River embankment)" the central task overriding all other work at present. Hui Yuyu, Director of the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office, also led an inspection team to conduct in-depth inspections of various sections of the canal embankment.

The canal embankment was divided into three sections—south, central, and north—and three flood control headquarters were established. The general headquarters and brigade headquarters of each county and district successively went to work on the embankment. The Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office, the Northern Jiangsu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the Taizhou Prefectural Office and the Taizhou District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, all successively transferred a large number of cadres to the embankment to assist in the work.

In order to gain the initiative and prepare for the arrival of the Huai River flood peak, the three dams south of Yangzhou on the canal—Lanjiang, Bihu, and Chushan Guijiang—were opened as early as July 18th and July 22nd, reducing the water volume of Gaoyou and Baoying Lakes; and dredging machines were used to deepen the foundations of each dam, increasing the canal's discharge capacity. In order to plan for the worst-case scenario, so that the canal embankment would not repeat the tragic disaster of collapsing and breaching in 1931 under the most critical circumstances, preparations were also made to open the Guihai Three Dams (Nanguan Dam, Xinba Dam, and Cheluo Dam between Gaoyou and Shaobo). The ten counties east of the canal also actively carried out drainage projects for the inland rivers.

Before the arrival of the Huai River water, the people along the canal embankment carried out emergency repairs on all dangerous works and sections: in the northern section, 90,000 laborers were mobilized to carry out key reinforcement; in the central section, 14,000 laborers in Huai'an repaired the western embankment; in the southern section, 46 dangerous works on the eastern embankment were all completed after half a month of emergency repairs by tens of thousands of laborers. In Jiangdu, in order to prevent floods from directly hitting the eastern embankment, willow mattress weirs were specially constructed on the western embankment. This was a major creation in engineering, and a great achievement in combining engineering technology with mass experience. In addition, telephones were installed along the embankment to speed up the transmission of information; electric lights were also specially installed in the dangerous sections of Gaoyou to facilitate patrol and emergency rescue.

Flood control materials were actively purchased by the government on the one hand, and on the other hand, people within fifteen li of the canal embankment were mobilized to carry out a "one stake, one plank, one bundle of firewood, one rush bag" donation campaign, overcoming the difficulty of materials.

Along the embankment, education and mobilization were carried out in depth using methods such as reporting water conditions and recounting the suffering caused by water disasters, in order to "ensure that the canal embankment does not collapse, and protect the autumn harvest and the lives and property" of the people. The paralyzing idea that "if repairs are good in the spring, it doesn't matter in summer and autumn" was corrected, and the broad masses were mobilized to participate in various flood control organizations. In the southern section of the canal, there were 1,000 people in the flood control backbone class, 13,900 people in the rescue team, and 43,000 people in the reserve team. Straw sheds were set up along the embankment, and inspections and guard duties were carried out by sections. Various localities successively reviewed their flood control forces. The Gaoyou Flood Control Headquarters held a flood control exercise in the wind and rain on August 1st.

The Huai River flood peak gradually entered the canal in early August. On the 16th, Gaoyou exceeded the prescribed danger water level. Although dangerous situations were continuously discovered in the 500 li of canal embankment south of Zahe, victory was finally achieved through all-out defense and emergency repairs. The Zhongba dangerous work, one of the six major dangerous works in the southern section of the canal, was the most serious. On the 10th, seepage occurred at the foot of the dam, and the inner support collapsed for more than 20 meters in length and 1 meter in width. Water seeped down the outer slope in the middle, and the dam foundation began to flow towards the pond, with the danger of a breach causing flooding within five hours. However, as soon as it was discovered, one gong sounded, and responses arose from all directions. More than 10,000 people from the surrounding 40 to 50 li—including troops, government cadres, workers, peasants, students, and citizens—rushed to Zhongba like a tide, carrying the rescue materials they had prepared in advance. After sixteen hours of rescue, millions of brick bags were stacked layer upon layer on the dam foundation, finally averting the crisis. The Second Regiment of the Northern Jiangsu Military Region, with a heroic fighting posture, fought bravely and selflessly, carrying more than 10,000 brick bags in one night, playing a decisive role in rescuing Zhongba. It was awarded a commendation by the headquarters and political department of the Northern Jiangsu Military Region.

After the temporary rescue, the six counties and cities of Jiangdu, Yangzhou, Xinghua, Taizhou, Gaoyou, and Baoying urgently mobilized more than 10,000 laborers to complete the comprehensive repair project of the Zhongba dangerous work in six days and nights. By this point, the entire canal defense line had defeated this year's first Huai River flood peak.

The flood control of the canal has achieved the first round of victory, and safely passed the tidal flood of August 16th (the third day of the seventh lunar month), but the dangerous period has not yet passed. Flood control organizations at all levels along the line and the broad masses of people should remain vigilant, prevent the emergence of slack emotions, and strive for the final safe passage of the canal embankment.

　　搏斗在运河堤上
    ——记苏北运河沿岸人民战胜今年首次洪水峰
    乔云铸　郑昌鸿　吴友松
    苏北的运河与洪泽湖、宝应湖、高邮湖相连。今年七月间淮河洪水陆续汇流洪泽湖后，苏北运堤便面临着严重的洪水威胁。
    七月二十一日，苏北人民行政公署召开运河防汛紧急会议，决定以“确保运堤与洪湖大堤，巩固沂堤（按即新沂河堤）”作为目前压倒一切工作的中心任务。苏北行署惠浴宇主任并率领检查组，深入运堤各段检查。
    运堤分南、中、北三段成立了三个防汛指挥部。各县区总队部、大队部相继上堤办公。苏北行署、中共苏北区党委以及泰州专署、中共泰州地委，均先后抽调大批干部上堤协助工作。
    为争取主动，迎接淮河洪水峰的到来，早在七月十八日和七月二十二日开放了扬州以南的运河拦江、壁虎、褚山归江三坝，减少了高、宝湖的水量；并用挖泥机挖深了各个坝基，增加了运河泄水量。为了要从最坏处打算，使运堤在最危急的情况下不再演一九三一年倒堤决口的惨祸，又作好开放归海三坝（高邮、邵伯间的南关坝、新坝、车逻坝）的准备。运东十县也积极进行了内河的排水工程。
    在淮水到来前，运堤沿岸人民对一切险工、险段，进行了紧急抢修工作：北段动员了九万民工，进行了重点培修；中段淮安一万四千民工修好了西堤；南段东堤四十六处险工，经数万民工半月抢修，已全部完成。江都为防止洪水直扑东堤，特在西堤上做了柳枕子堰，此为工程上的一大创造，也就是工程技术与群众经验相结合的伟大收获。此外，沿堤均架设电话，加速情况传递；高邮险工段还特别架设了电灯，便利巡查抢险。
    防汛器材一面由政府积极筹购，一面动员沿运堤十五里以内的人民，开展“一根桩，一块板、一束柴、一只蒲包”的捐献器材运动，克服了器材的困难。
    沿堤各地先后用报水情、诉水苦等方式，深入作了“确保运堤不溃决，保卫秋收和生命财产”的动员教育，纠正了“春天修得好，夏秋不要紧”的麻痹思想，动员了广大群众参加各种防汛组织。运河南段参加防洪基干班的群众有一千人，抢险队一万三千九百人，预备队四万三千人，沿堤搭设草棚，按段检查守护。各地先后检阅了防汛力量，高邮防汛总队部八月一日在风雨中举行了防汛演习。
    淮河洪水峰于八月上旬逐渐进入运河，十六日，高邮超过规定危险水位。皂河以南五百华里的运河堤防，虽曾连续发现险象，经全力防守，突击抢修，终于获得胜利。运河南段六大险工之一的中坝险象最为严重。十日坝脚渗漏，内戗塌陷二十余公尺长、一公尺宽，中部外坡下水，坝基开始向塘心流动，五小时内有决口酿成水灾的危险。但是一经发现，一处锣响，应声四起，周围四五十里以内的军队、机关干部、工人、农民、学生、市民一万多人，带着早已准备好的抢险器材，像潮水一样的涌上了中坝。经十六小时的抢救，千万只砖包层层的堆在坝基上，终于挽救了危局。苏北军区特二团以英勇的战斗姿态，奋不顾身，一夜扛砖包一万多只，起了抢救中坝的决定作用。获得了苏北军区司令部、政治部的传令嘉奖。
    经过临时的抢救后，江都、扬州、兴化、泰州、高邮、宝应等六县市，又紧急动员一万余民工经六昼夜的努力，完成了中坝险工全面加修工程。至此运防全线战胜了今年首次淮河洪水峰。
    运河防汛已取得第一个回合的胜利，平安地度过八月十六日（阴历七月初三）的潮汛，但危险时期尚未过去，沿线各级防汛组织和广大人民，仍应提高警惕，防止产生松懈情绪，争取运河堤防最后安全度过。
