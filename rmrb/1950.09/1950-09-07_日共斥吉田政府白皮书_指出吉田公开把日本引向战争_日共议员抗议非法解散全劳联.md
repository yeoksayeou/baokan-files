The Japanese Communist Party Condemns Yoshida Government White Paper
Points Out Yoshida Openly Leads Japan Towards War
Japanese Communist Party Deputies Protest Illegal Dissolution of the All-Japan Federation of Labor Unions

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to a United Press dispatch on August 23rd: The Japanese Communist Party Temporary Central Guidance Department issued a statement denouncing the Yoshida government's diplomatic white paper, entitled "The Korean War and Japan's Position," released on August 19th, stating: This document clearly shows that Yoshida and his cronies are openly leading Japan into war, aggression, and even destruction, and are traitors to the nation. The Yoshida clique explicitly announced its opposition to the vanguard of the world's peace and democracy camp, the Soviet Union, one of the major member states of the United Nations, which is no different from what Hitler said in "Mein Kampf." This is also the same as Tojo's incitement to "annihilate the American and British beasts," and Yoshida's own participation in planning the invasion of China with anti-Soviet and anti-communist machinations. Now, for all democratic forces and patriots in Japan, only one thing is necessary: resolute action and unity. We are full of confidence to fight to the end for peace and independence. We express this firm will and expect the people of the whole country to rise up.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: According to TASS on the 5th: Three Japanese Communist Party members of parliament visited the Ministry of Justice to protest the illegal dissolution of the All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Council.

The American and Japanese authorities are taking all measures to suppress the movement of electrical industry workers protesting the dissolution of the All-Japan Federation of Labor Unions. According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," Masman, the representative of the American occupation authorities in Kyushu, forbade the Kyushu branch of the National Electrical Industry Workers' Union to call on workers to strike. Masman insisted that the strike was a violation of occupation policy. Kyodo News reported that the Osaka Police Department searched the Osaka branch of the National Electrical Industry Workers' Union on August 30.

　　日共斥吉田政府白皮书
    指出吉田公开把日本引向战争
    日共议员抗议非法解散全劳联
    【新华社六日讯】据联合通讯社八月二十三日讯：日本共产党临时中央指导部发表声明，斥责吉田政府于八月十九日发表的题为《朝鲜战争及日本立场》的外交白皮书称：这一文件明白地表示吉田及其党羽都是公开引导日本陷入战争、侵略以至破灭的卖国贼。吉田集团明确地宣布反对向世界和平民主阵营的先锋、联合国主要会员国之一的苏联，这和希特勒在《我的奋斗》中的话丝毫无异。这也是东条煽动“歼灭美英畜牲”的说法，和吉田自己也参加计划侵略中国时的反苏、反共的策动，完全一样。现在对于日本的一切民主势力及爱国者只有一件事是必要的，就是坚决的行动和团结。我们充满着自信，为和平、独立奋斗到底。我们表明这个坚决的意志，并期待全国人民奋起。
    【新华社六日讯】据塔斯社五日讯：日本国会共产党议员三人访问法务府，抗议非法解散全日工会联络协议会。
    美、日当局正采取一切措施，压制电气产业工人抗议解散全劳联的运动。据《每日新闻》称，九州岛美国占领当局代表马斯曼禁止全国电气产业工会九州分会号召工人罢工。马斯曼硬说罢工是违反占领政策的。共同社报道说，大阪警察局于八月三十日搜查了全国电气产业工会大阪分会。
