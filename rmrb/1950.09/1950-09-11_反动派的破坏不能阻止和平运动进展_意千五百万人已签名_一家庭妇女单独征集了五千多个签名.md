Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 7th: The "Pravda" published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent, Chichikina, on the 5th, stating that 15 million people in Italy have signed the Stockholm Appeal. Italy collected 7 million signatures in the movement against the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, so the above figure of 15 million indicates that millions more have joined the peace camp.

The Italian reactionaries are doing everything in their power to hinder the peace movement. Police destroyed every poster of the Peace Committee erected on the streets of Rome, banned the distribution of leaflets, and in many towns, peace activists were persecuted and arrested by the police. Peace activists also suffered widespread economic retaliation; in some enterprises, signing the Stockholm Appeal resulted in dismissal. However, all this was in vain, and the number of peace defenders is increasing day by day. The communiqués issued by the Peace Committee include the names of people from all walks of life: workers, writers, farmers, Catholic priests, manufacturers, actors, merchants, and teachers. In many towns, almost all residents signed.

In a working-class district of Rome, a woman named Tricarico, who does not belong to any political party but is an ordinary housewife and mother of seven children, did not want her children to die in a war that would bring profits to American millionaires. She often carried white paper with a dove of peace on it, calling on people to sign. She has now collected 5,370 signatures.

The peace relay run of the youth started from Rome in early August, passed through the whole country to Genoa, and then continued from there to Nice, France. Everywhere along the way, Italian youth held rallies demanding a ban on the atomic bomb and an end to the American aggression against Korea. Italian youth are now preparing for the Second Congress of Peace Defenders.

　　反动派的破坏不能阻止和平运动进展
    意千五百万人已签名
    一家庭妇女单独征集了五千多个签名
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报五日发表契奇金纳的罗马通讯称：意大利已经有一千五百万人在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。在反对侵略性的北大西洋公约运动中，意大利共征集了七百万人的签名，因此上述一千五百万人的数字表示，又有数百万人参加了和平阵营。
    意大利反动派用尽一切力量来阻挠和平运动。警察毁坏了和平委员会在罗马街头树立的每一个招贴牌，禁止散发传单，在许多市镇中，和平运动者都遭到警察的迫害和逮捕。和平运动者还受到广泛的经济报复，某些企业里，在斯德哥尔摩宣言上签名，就会遭到解雇。但是，这一切都是徒劳无功的，和平保卫者的数目是一天天地增加了。在和平委员会发表的公报上，可以看到工人，作家，农民，天主教牧师，制造商，演员，商人，教师等各种职业的人的名字。许多乡镇中，几乎全体居民都签了名。
    在罗马工人区，有一个名叫特里卡利科的妇人，她不属于任何政党，只是一位寻常的家庭主妇，七个孩子的母亲。他不愿她的孩子们在将使美国百万富翁获得利润的战争中去送死，经常带着上面有和平之鸽的白纸，号召人民签名。现在，他已征集到五千三百七十个签名。
    青年们的和平接力跑是于八月初从罗马出发的，经过全国直达热那亚，再从那里继续向法国的尼斯进发。沿路所经各地，意大利青年均举行集会，要求禁止原子弹并停止美国对朝鲜的侵略。现在，意大利青年正在准备第二次和平保卫者大会。
