　　"Glory to You!"
    Written by the collective of reporters of this newspaper
    Our Chinese nation is a diligent and brave nation. Revolutionary heroism and a spirit of selfless dedication are universally promoted and respected in New China. The National Conference of Combat Heroes and Model Workers, which opened yesterday, is a powerful demonstration of this national virtue being respected. The more than eight hundred attending delegates were all workers, peasants, and workers and peasants in military uniforms who were exploited, oppressed, despised, and had no status in the old society. But in the new society, these people are respected and praised by the people of the whole country, and people cheer to them: "Glory to you!". Our country bestows upon them the titles of heroes and models, and hangs bright red flowers on their chests...
    Is there anything more glorious than this scene? People will never forget this moving scene today. Chairman Mao stood up amid the thunderous applause of the delegates and read the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the conference. The telegram said: "Express our gratitude and respect for your work!" Commander-in-Chief Zhu also said in his speech that the people of the whole country are welcoming heroes and thanking heroes. International friends also sent out the same voice of praise. Braga, the head of the delegation of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, was invited to speak and emphasized that the work of heroes and model workers made a great contribution to the cause of international peace; Grom, the representative of the Free Austrian Youth League, said: "The working class all over the world thanks the Chinese combat heroes and labor heroes." "Because of your efforts, you have promoted the failure of imperialism." Children from the nursery presented gifts and dedications to the conference. A seven or eight-year-old child said naively: "Uncles and aunties: We want to learn from you and become heroes and models when we grow up."
    The representatives deeply understand that this glory is not easily obtained. Without the establishment of New China, who would look up to these representatives, these working people? These more than eight hundred heroes and models, for our beloved People's China, have fought bravely and unyieldingly, and shed countless blood and sweat. On the vast land stretching from Changbai Mountain in the north to Wuzhi Mountain in the south, in the long and arduous war, the outstanding members of our people—the combat heroes present, some of whom had been wounded more than a dozen times. Zhang Shuyi, a veteran of honor, had both feet broken by the enemy, but after retiring from the army, he became a labor hero again. The labor models who have grown up on the production front not only spend their thoughts, use their physical strength, and shed sweat, but sometimes also shed blood for public affairs. Zhao Guilan left many scars on her body because she protected state property and endured the pain of not throwing away fulminate of mercury. Liu Yuhou, who was sitting on the rostrum next to Chairman Mao, is an outstanding labor hero. When the Kuomintang bandit army attacked Yan'an, he led a stretcher team, accompanied the army for a long time, and persisted in the liberation war in the Northwest region with Chairman Mao, and finally won the victory of annihilating the Jiang family bandits in the Northwest region. Many representatives participated in the hero and model conferences during the Anti-Japanese War and the Liberation War. At that time, we were heavily blockaded by the enemy, and the venues were sometimes set up in remote mountain ravines, and the representatives used stones as chairs. Later, the revolution continued to develop, and a large number of new heroes emerged. They combined with the broad masses of people and fought for a unified goal in different regions, and finally created a new China and created the conditions for the glorious meeting of national heroes and models.
    How was this victory achieved? Everyone knows that without their own leader to steer and lead the way, they would not have the strength to turn themselves over. Therefore, on the way to Beijing, the first thing the representatives said to each other was: "Go to Beijing to see Chairman Mao!" Now that we have really seen Chairman Mao, a new invincible force has grown in their hearts.
    Combat hero Liu Meicun said to the person next to him that it was a great honor for him to see Chairman Mao again today. The comrade next to him said, "Haven't you seen him several times?" The hero replied, "It would be more glorious to see him every day!"
    Combat hero Li Qingchun said excitedly: "It is a major event in my life to see my leader. This counts as living worthwhile! How could there have been such a thing in the past feudal society? I am a soldier, and I have also seen Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. I must do a good job when I go back this time, otherwise, I will be sorry to Chairman Mao."
    "It is not easy to see representatives from various countries," was another hero's feeling. He said, "China's victory has really shaken the world. People value us so much, regard us as an example, and want to learn from us. If we don't produce some achievements, we will be sorry for their hopes."
    Gu Xing, a guerrilla combat hero from Guangdong and Guangxi, recalled that before he came to Beijing, his superiors told him to say hello to Chairman Mao on his behalf and convey the feelings of the Guangdong-Guangxi Column and the people of the eight counties in the Pearl River Delta to their leader. "I thought along the way, how can I accomplish this task? I thought: five minutes would be enough. Unexpectedly, when I got here, I received an admission ticket, and it turned out to be number 821. That's so far away, I'm afraid I can't even see the leader's face clearly. I was very anxious. Later, I heard that I was going to present a flag, and I was overjoyed. Commander-in-Chief Zhu shook my hand twice, and Chairman Mao shook my hand four times. I really wanted to say hello to him, but there were too many people around and I didn't have a chance to speak. I will work hard in the future, and when I come again next time, I will try to talk to Chairman Mao and buy a beautiful notebook and ask him to write some words as a souvenir. I will never let go of this notebook even if I die."
    Chen Liwen, a combat hero of the Qiongya Column and a member of the Li ethnic group, said: "When I was on Hainan Island, I always wanted to see Chairman Mao. This time I saw him, and Chairman Mao came to see us. After I saw the leader, I have energy to do everything. I fought on Hainan Island for nine years. Whenever I encountered difficulties, I thought of Chairman Mao, and the difficulties were overcome. At that time, I never dreamed that I could really see him today."
    Li Lanzhen, who contributed to supporting the front during the Huaihai Campaign, smiled so hard that her eyes narrowed into two lines when she saw Chairman Mao. She said she was extremely happy: "Chairman Mao is so healthy, he looks like he's only in his early forties."
    Liu Fupei, an old worker with thirty-eight years of experience who rescued huge amounts of materials during the "February 6th" bombing in Shanghai, presented a flag on the rostrum and shook hands with Chairman Mao. He sincerely told reporters: This is the greatest happiness, "I will get better even if I am sick!"
    Jin Longshan, the hero of protecting the factory at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, said: "I didn't expect that workers would have such glory today and be able to talk to Chairman Mao casually. Chairman Mao's spirit deeply moved me. After I go back, I must unite the masses well and consult with the masses in everything, otherwise I will violate his spirit."
    Liang Xiuying is a female labor hero from northern Shaanxi. Before coming to Beijing, she launched three hundred women to participate in the peace signature campaign. She said: "I am a rural woman, and I am so happy to see Chairman Mao. When Hu Zongnan attacked Yan'an, he captured me, first hung me up and beat me, and then buried me alive. Even when the soil was buried up to my chest, I didn't say a bad word. I have suffered enough, and I hate the reactionaries to the core. Chairman Mao loves us, and we will always follow him."
    Lin Shiyao, an electrical worker from Xi'an, thought about whether he would see Chairman Mao all the way from Xi'an after being elected as a labor model. He said: Now I have seen him, but I feel like I haven't seen enough. However, I have kept Chairman Mao's words in my heart, and when I go back, I will step up production and respond to his call."
    Du Xianyang, the flag bearer of the "Iron Bull Movement" and a special-class labor model of the railway, attended the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. He said: "I saw Chairman Mao every day at that time. I have seen him again this time, and Chairman Mao is stronger than he was at the last meeting!" He said that this grand gathering of worker-peasant-soldier heroes and models symbolizes that the people of the whole country are united around Chairman Mao and firmly follow Chairman Mao. If American imperialism dares to invade us, we will definitely drive it into the sea."
    Tian Guiying, the first female driver in New China, told reporters that when she officially drove for the first time on the March 8th Women's Day last year, she thought that this was the glory given to her by Chairman Mao. She had long wanted to see Chairman Mao and thank him in person. She said: Unfortunately, there were too many people when I presented the gift today, and I didn't have a chance to speak, so I just shook hands tightly to express her heart.
    Zhao Hongzhang, a breeding model, said after seeing Chairman Mao: "I know everyone cares about Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, who is fifty-seven years old, is as healthy as someone in his thirties or forties. When I go back, I will quickly tell everyone to make my family happy and feel at ease."
    Shen Jichang, a representative from the Zhuoni Tibetan area in Gansu Province, said: "I can't speak Mandarin well, but I am happy in my heart and can't express it in words. When I return to the Tibetan area, I will definitely tell Chairman Mao's words to the Tibetan people properly."

　　“光荣归于你们！”
    本报记者集体写作
    我们中华民族是个勤劳、勇敢的民族。革命英雄主义和奋不顾身的工作精神，在新中国受到普遍的推崇和尊敬。昨天开幕的全国战斗英雄、劳动模范代表会议，就是这种民族美德受人尊重的有力说明。八百多位出席的代表，都是过去在旧社会里，被剥削、被压迫、被卑视，没有任何地位的工人、农民和穿了军装的工农。但在新社会里，这些人却受到全国人民的崇敬和歌颂，人们向他们欢呼：“光荣归于你们！”。我们的国家授给他们英雄、模范的称号，在他们胸前挂上鲜艳的红花……
    还有比这种情景更光荣的么？人们是永远不能忘记今天这个动人的场面。毛主席在代表们雷动的掌声中站起来，宣读中共中央给大会的贺电。贺电中说：“向你们的工作表示感谢和敬意！”朱总司令讲话时，也说：全国人民都在欢迎英雄，感谢英雄。国际友人发出同样的赞颂的声音。世界民主青联代表团团长布拉加被邀讲话，强调指出：英雄、劳模的工作，对国际和平事业有伟大的贡献；自由奥地利青年联盟代表葛罗姆则说：“全世界工人阶级都感谢中国的战斗英雄与劳动英雄。”“由于你们的努力，促进了帝国主义的失败。”保育院的儿童们向大会献礼，献词。一个七、八岁的儿童，天真地说道：“叔叔、阿姨们：我们要向你们学习，长大了，当个英雄、模范。”
    代表们深深地懂得，这种光荣不是容易得来的。没有新中国的成立，谁看得起这些代表，这些劳动人民呢？这八百多位英雄、模范，为了我们可爱的人民中国，曾经奋不顾身地顽强斗争，不知道流过多少血汗。在北起长白山、南迄五指山的广大土地上，在长期艰苦的战争中，我国人民中的优秀分子——在座的战斗英雄，有人曾负过十几次伤。荣誉军人张树义，两脚被敌人打断了，但是，他在退伍以后，又成了劳动英雄。在生产战线上生长起来的劳动模范，不只费思想，用体力，流汗水，有时也因公流了鲜血。赵桂兰就是因为保护国家资财，忍痛不丢雷汞，在自己身上留下许多伤疤。坐在主席台上、坐在毛主席身边的刘玉厚，是个出色的劳动英雄。在国民党匪军进攻延安时，他领导一个担架队，长期随军行动，和毛主席一起坚持西北地区的解放战争，最后获得歼灭西北地区蒋家匪帮的胜利。多少代表都参加过抗日战争和解放战争时期的英模会议，那时候，我们被敌人重重封锁，会场有时设在偏僻的山沟中，代表们以石头当椅子。以后，革命不断发展，新英雄大批涌现出来，他们和广大群众相结合，在不同的地区为统一的目标而奋斗，终于打出一个新中国，创造了全国英模光荣会师的条件。
    这种胜利是怎样得到的呢？每一个人都晓得，如果没有自己的领袖掌舵，引路，自己是没有力量，不能翻身的。因此，在到北京的路上，代表们见面后第一句话总是说：“到北京看毛主席去！”现在，我们真正看见了毛主席，于是，在他们心里生长了新的无敌的力量。
    战斗英雄刘梅村和他旁边的人说，他今天又见到毛主席，真是光荣。旁边那个同志说：“你不是见过几次了吗？”这位英雄回答道：“天天见那才光荣呢！”
    战斗英雄李庆春兴奋地说：“见见自己的领袖是一辈子的大事。这算活值啦！过去封建社会那有这样的事？我是个大兵，也见到了毛主席和朱总司令。这次回去可得好好地干，要不，对不起毛主席。”
    “见到各国代表也不容易，”这是另一个英雄的感想。他说“中国的胜利真是震动天下，人家对咱多看重，把咱当做榜样，要向咱学习。咱要不拿些成绩出来，就对不起人家的希望。”
    两广游击战斗英雄古兴回忆他来北京之前，上级叮咛他，要他向毛主席问好，并把两广纵队和珠江三角洲八县人民的心意，带给自己的领袖。“我一路上寻思，怎么能完成这个任务呢？我想：能有五分钟的时间就可以了。不料到了这里，发下来入场证，一看是八百二十一号。那么远，恐怕连领袖的面相也看不清楚。心里直着急。后来听说要我献旗，可乐开了。朱总司令握了我两下，毛主席握了我四下，我很想问他好，可是周围人太多，没有机会开口。以后我要好好工作，下回再来了，争取要和毛主席说话，要买一个漂亮本子，请他写些话纪念纪念，这本子我死也不会放的。”
    琼崖纵队的战斗英雄陈理文是黎族人，他说：“在海南岛的时候，总想能见见毛主席才好。这回见了，毛主席来看了我们。我见了领袖以后，干什么都有劲。我在海南岛作战九年，碰到困难想一想毛主席，困难就克服了。那时候，做梦也想不到今天真能见到他。”
    淮海战役支前有功的李兰贞看到毛主席，眼睛笑成两条线，她说她高兴极了：“毛主席真健康，看来不过四十出头些。”
    上海“二、六”轰炸时抢救巨额物资有功的三十八年工龄的老工人柳富培到主席台上献旗，和毛主席握了手。他真诚地向记者表示：这是最大的幸福，“有病也会好的！”
    上海江南造船所护厂英雄金龙山说：“没想到今天工人有这样的光荣，能和毛主席随便说话。毛主席的精神，深深感动了我。我回去后，一定要好好团结群众，凡事和群众商量，否则就违反了他的精神。”
    梁秀英是陕北的女劳动英雄。他来北京以前，曾发动了三百名妇女参加和平签名。她说：“我是一个农村妇女，能看见毛主席，实在太高兴了。胡宗南进攻延安时，抓住了我，先吊打，后活埋。土埋到胸口，我也没说一句坏话。我吃够了苦，我恨透了反动派。毛主席爱我们，我们永远跟着他走。”
    西安电气工人林师尧当选劳模后，从西安出发，一路上便惦念着会不会看见毛主席。他说：现在我看见了，可是觉得看的不够。不过，毛主席的话，我都记在心里了，回去我要加紧生产，响应他的号召。”
    铁路特等劳动模范铁牛运动旗手杜先扬，曾经出席政协第二次全国会议。他说：“那时天天见到毛主席。这次又见到了，毛主席比上次开会时更强健啦！”他说，这次工农兵英模大聚会，象征着全国人民团结在毛主席周围，坚决跟着毛主席走。如果美国帝国主义敢来侵犯我们，一定把它赶到海里去。”
    新中国第一个女司机田桂英告诉记者：她在去年三八节第一次正式开车时，就想到这是毛主席给她的光荣。她早想看看毛主席，当面感谢他。她说：可惜，今天献礼时人太多，没有机会讲话，只好紧紧握手，表示她的心意。
    育种模范赵洪章看了毛主席以后说：“我知道大家都关心毛主席，五十七岁的毛主席还像三四十岁的人那样健康。我回去要很快告诉大家，让家里的人都高兴，都放心。”
    甘肃省卓尼藏区代表申继昌说：“我的汉话说不好，心里高兴，嘴里说不出来。回到藏区，我一定把毛主席的话，好好地告诉藏民们。”
