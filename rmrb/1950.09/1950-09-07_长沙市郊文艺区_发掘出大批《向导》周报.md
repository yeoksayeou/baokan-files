　　Changsha Suburban Literary and Art Area
    A large number of "The Guide" Weekly Unearthed
    [Our Newspaper] According to Liu Xinlie's letter from the Suburban District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Changsha, a large number of the most important publications of the Great Revolution era—"The Guide" Weekly—have recently been unearthed in the 8th Bao of the Literary and Art Area of Suburban Changsha. The letter also included Issue No. 201 of the publication, published on July 18, 1927, which contains the "Declaration of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Political Situation" of July 13, 1927, the "Draft Action Program for the Current National Revolution" proposed by the Communist Party of China to the people of the whole country at that time, and the "Resignation Letters of Tan Pingshan and Su Zhaozheng" and other documents. Although the paper has turned earthy in color due to being buried for too long, and the edges of the publication have been corroded, the text is still very clear. According to local veteran farmers and Comrade Peng Yi, who works locally, these publications were buried underground on the instructions of Comrade Teng Daiyuan, the current Minister of Railways of the Central People's Government, who was then leading the Changsha Suburban Farmers' Association, when the Red Army was about to withdraw from Changsha. Comrade Ling Lusheng was a member of the Communist Party of China. Later, he was branded and tortured by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and he sacrificed himself without yielding.

　　长沙市郊文艺区
    发掘出大批《向导》周报
    【本报讯】据中共长沙市委会郊区党委会刘新烈来信：长沙市郊文艺区第八保，最近发掘出大批大革命时代最重要的刊物——《向导》周报。来信并附来一九二七年七月十八日出版的该刊第二○一期，上载有一九二七年七月十三日《中国共产党中央委员会对政局宣言》、中国共产党当时向全国人民提出的《国民革命的目前行动政纲草案》及《谭平山、苏兆征辞职书》等文献。虽因埋藏过久，纸张已成土色，刊物边缘已经腐蚀，但文字尚十分清楚。据当地老农及在当地工作的彭义同志谈：这些刊物，是现任中央人民政府铁道部长滕代远同志当时领导长沙郊区农会，于红军将撤出长沙时，指示当地农会干部凌禄生同志埋在地下的。凌禄生同志系中共党员，后被国民党反动派烙刑拷问，不屈牺牲。
