　　The Role of Cooperatives in Production and Disaster Relief Over the Past Year
    Feng Yun
    Last year, approximately 120 million mu of farmland and 40 million people across the country suffered from varying degrees of waterlogging, drought, insect pests, hail, and other disasters, affecting sixteen provinces (472 counties). This was a serious situation. However, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, the correct policy of "production for self-relief, social mutual assistance, and government support" was proposed. Through the concerted efforts of cadres at all levels and the masses in disaster areas, this serious disaster was finally overcome.

    I. Developing and Consolidating Cooperative Undertakings Through Solving the Difficulties of Disaster Victims

    In the disaster relief work over the past year, cooperatives in various regions have played a significant role; the organization and business of the cooperatives themselves have also been developed and consolidated in the production and disaster relief work.

    Firstly, in terms of organizing disaster victims for production and promoting the sale of their products, statistics from several regions including Northern Jiangsu, Northern Anhui, Hebei, Pingyuan, Chahar, Western Liaoning, Shandong, Southern Jiangsu, and Zhejiang over the past year show that the total value of purchased and sold disaster victims' products (including mats, homespun cloth, cattail bags, pigs, fish, shrimp, pig bristles, oil, leather, straw-braided hats, sausage casings, sulfur, almonds, persimmon cakes, and pears, etc.) is equivalent to approximately 2 billion jin of grain, sustaining the lives of about 10 million disaster victims for three months. Among them, the total value of local products purchased and sold in disaster areas in Northern Jiangsu in one year was equivalent to approximately 58.3 million jin of coarse grain; in Northern Anhui, statistics for the first half of this year alone show that the total value of promoted disaster area products was equivalent to 60 million jin of coarse grain, sustaining the lives of 4 million disaster victims for two months; the cooperatives in the four counties of Sihai, Chicheng, Longguan, and Yanqing in Chahar Province organized the masses to dig 2.4 million jin of medicinal herbs, exchanging them for 800,000 jin of millet. In addition, in order to relieve disaster victims, the People's Liberation Army used some homespun cloth for military uniforms this year, organizing the masses in disaster areas to produce 180 million square feet of homespun cloth through cooperatives. With an average manual labor fee of five liang of grain per square foot, the disaster victims could obtain a supplement of 56 million jin of food.

    Secondly, cooperatives have also achieved great success in supplying disaster victims with living and production materials. According to statistics from nine regions including Northern Jiangsu over the past year, the total supply was approximately 2.4 billion jin of grain. Among them, Hebei province adjusted and managed 450 million jin of grain (including coarse grain exchanged for fine grain) to disaster areas from September 1949 to May this year; and transported 100,000 tons of coal. In addition, the China Grain Company transferred about 400 million jin of coarse grain from Northeast China to disaster areas through cooperatives in exchange for fine grain; lending before the wheat harvest and collecting after the wheat harvest, each jin of wheat could be exchanged for 1.6 liang of red sorghum on average in various places. In this way, the disaster areas increased their food supply by another 150 million jin, which not only helped farmers overcome the disaster but also stabilized wheat prices.

    Over the past year, the People's Bank of China has lent nearly 200 million jin of grain through cooperatives to support the handicrafts, agriculture, and sideline production in disaster areas, helping disaster victims purchase additional farm tools, seeds, and fertilizers, and restore production in disaster areas.

    In the production and disaster relief movement, many cooperatives have been established in areas where there were none before; the original cooperative areas have been further expanded and developed. For example, in the production and disaster relief in Northern Jiangsu over the past year, mass cooperatives have grown from 131 to 734, an increase of nearly six times; the number of members has increased from 61,000 to 375,000, also an increase of more than six times; the share capital grain has also increased from 1.6 million jin to 7.72 million jin, an increase of nearly four times. Not only has there been a development in quantity, but also further organized various types of production groups, including weaving, oil pressing, vermicelli making, fishing, transportation, tree digging, carpentry, and mat weaving. For example, the Huaiyin and Taizhou special districts in Northern Jiangsu organized 8,747 such groups; the Gu Su county district in Northern Anhui also organized 1,642.

    The above are the achievements of cooperative work in production and disaster relief over the past year, as well as the organizational and business development of cooperatives.

    II. Some shortcomings in organizational lines and management methods

    In the work over the past year, there are still some shortcomings and deviations in the organization and business of cooperatives. Firstly, some areas are not good at leading production and disaster relief through the economic activities of cooperatives. Many cadres are still only accustomed to using administrative methods. For example, the disaster victims in Huiji County, Shandong Province, were initially very enthusiastic about sideline production, but due to the lack of overall planning and organization by the cooperatives, the sales stagnated and production could not continue. Another example is the following phenomenon in Eastern Hebei: the government overcame various difficulties and transported relief grain to disaster-stricken villages, but because there was no cooperative organization to lead, the disaster victims had to carry the grain to the market themselves to exchange for production tools, and merchants took the opportunity to purchase at low prices. The occurrence of these phenomena is due to the fact that leadership organs in some areas do not attach importance to cooperative work.

    Secondly, although some areas have already established cooperative organizations, they have insufficient understanding of how cooperatives should correctly serve disaster-stricken members, or due to poor planning and mismanagement, they have still failed to solve the difficulties of disaster victims well, and the development of cooperatives has also been hindered. For example, some cooperatives only emphasize business operations and neglect organizational work; or there is a purely relief viewpoint, neglecting the rational management of business. Some cadres in Northern Anhui believe that disaster victims are unable to raise shares, so they neglect organizational work. For example, some cooperatives, ignoring the difficulties of members in disaster-stricken areas such as lack of grain and firewood, still sell cigarettes, alcohol, superstitious items, and cosmetics. Some cooperatives have not solved the difficulties for disaster victims. In addition, some cooperative cadres have neglected the safekeeping and care of people's property, resulting in significant losses. For example, 39 dan of ginned cotton in the Sheyang County Supply and Marketing Department in Northern Jiangsu became moldy and rotten; 1,200 jin of wheat in the Limin Cooperative in Rudong County became moldy and rotten, and so on. These shortcomings and deviations must be resolutely corrected.

    III. Summarize experiences and lessons and prepare to prevent disasters

    Although last year's disaster was successfully overcome, some areas have experienced new disasters this year. Recently, the floods in Northern Anhui inundated 13 million mu of farmland; the Fuyang River and Daqing River in Hebei breached, inundating more than 5,000 villages and 18 million mu of land; other areas also experienced some varying degrees of flooding. Therefore, it is necessary to summarize past experiences and lessons, continue to strengthen production and disaster relief work, and carry out disaster prevention in an organized and planned manner.

    Firstly, leading cadres at all levels should attach importance to the role of cooperative work in production and disaster relief. In addition to the party and government organs and various organizations actively strengthening the leadership of cooperatives, they should also dispatch capable cadres and appropriately allocate funds to help the masses improve the cooperative structure, strengthen planning, and improve their business operations. In particular, higher-level cooperatives should regularly go to lower-level cooperatives to check and supervise, and help solve specific problems and difficulties in various tasks.

    Secondly, the main difficulty in production and disaster relief work is the sales problem of products. In addition to state-owned departments actively supporting in terms of procurement, prices, and loans, cooperatives themselves should actively seek sales channels in various places based on local production and sales conditions, and strive to adopt a contract system to ensure planned management; adopting long-distance sales, conducting exchanges with grain-producing areas, and other methods are also possible and effective. For some scattered and fragmented products, when state-owned enterprises and cooperatives are unable to purchase all of them, they should guide and help members to transport and sell them themselves, and adopt a policy of small profits and quick turnover in business; and effectively prevent the gracious view of purchasing products at excessively high prices, so as to avoid unsold phenomena.

    Thirdly, the main source of funds for supply and marketing operations must rely on and organize the masses' own financial strength; at the same time, it is also necessary for the state to provide support in the following ways: (1) Government special funds for support; (2) Banks issue longer-term interest-free or low-interest loans; (3) The Disaster Relief Committee allocates a portion of relief grain as cooperative procurement funds; (4) Higher-level cooperatives allocate funds to purchase products from disaster areas, and accelerate capital turnover; (5) Funds from the state-owned trading department's entrusted acquisitions, orders, and current accounts.

    Expanding business and increasing funds from multiple sources is necessary, but it is necessary to prevent the dependence of grassroots cooperatives on the allocation of funds from higher-level cooperatives.

    Fourthly, cooperatives in disaster areas should actively promote the production of marketable sideline products, while combining with longer-term agricultural production. Although agricultural production is a longer-term fundamental method in the production process, in a severe situation where disaster relief is like putting out a fire, the main reliance is only on shorter-term sideline production to increase income, so as to quickly and effectively overcome the disaster. And leading sideline production is an extremely trivial and detailed task, which has been proven by our experience over the past year. In the past, although various places have also vigorously and widely developed sideline production and achieved some results, some areas have been at a loss when the disaster is serious due to a lack of foresight. Some sideline productions lack organization and leadership, resulting in poor product quality and affecting sales and collapse. The main link for cooperatives to support sideline production is to actively supply raw materials and promote finished products.

　　一年来合作社在生产救灾中的作用
    冯云
    去年全国约有一亿二千万亩耕地和四千万人民遭受到轻重不同的水、旱、虫、雹等灾害，波及十六省（四百七十二县）。这曾是一个严重的情况。但在毛主席及中央人民政府英明的领导下，提出了“生产自救、社会互济、政府支持”的正确方针，经过各级干部及灾区群众一致的努力，终于战胜了这一严重的灾荒。
    一、从解决灾民的困难中，发展和巩固了合作事业
    在一年来的救灾工作中，各地合作社起着很大的作用；合作社本身的组织和业务，也在生产救灾工作中得到了发展与巩固。
    首先就组织灾民生产、推销灾民产品而言，根据苏北、皖北、河北、平原、察哈尔、辽西、山东、苏南及浙江等几个地区一年来统计：收购与推销灾民产品（包括席子、土布、蒲包、猪、鱼、虾、猪鬃、油、皮硝、草帽辫、肠衣、硫黄、杏仁、柿饼及梨等）总额约折粮二十余亿斤，维持了约一千万灾民三个月的生活。其中苏北在一年中收购外销灾区土产总值即折粗粮约五千八百三十万斤；皖北仅今年上半年统计，推销灾区产品总值折粗粮六千万斤，维持了四百万灾民两个月的生活；察省的四海、赤城、龙关、延庆四县合作社组织群众刨药材二百四十万斤，换得小米八十万斤。此外，人民解放军为了救济灾胞，今年军衣穿一部分土布，通过合作社组织灾区群众生产土布一亿八千万方尺，每方尺手工费平均以五两粮食计算，则灾民可得五千六百万斤食粮的补充。
    其次，合作社在供给灾民生活资料及生产资料上也有很大成绩。根据苏北等九个区一年来统计：供给总额粮约二十四亿斤。其中河北自一九四九年九月至今年五月向灾区调剂及经营粮食四亿五千万斤（包括粗粮换细粮）；运煤十万吨。此外，中国粮食公司将东北粗粮四亿斤左右，通过合作社以粗换细调剂灾区；麦前贷，麦后收，各地平均每斤小麦可换红粮一斤六两。这样，又使灾区增加了一亿五千万斤食粮，不但帮助农民度过了灾荒，而且也平稳了麦价。
    一年来人民银行为扶植灾区手工业、农业及副业生产，通过合作社贷粮近二亿斤，帮助灾民购添农具、种籽和肥料，恢复灾区生产。
    在生产救灾运动中，原来没有合作社的地区，现在也建立了不少；原有合作社地区，则更加扩大和发展了。如苏北在一年来的生产救灾中，群众性的合作社，由一百三十一社发展至七百三十四社，增至将近六倍；社员则由六万一千人发展到三十七万五千人，也增至六倍多；股金粮亦由一百六十万斤增加到七百七十二万斤，增加将近四倍。不但在数量上有了发展，而且更进一步地组织了各式各样的生产小组，包括织布、榨油、络粉（做粉条）、捕鱼、运输、刨树、铁木匠和编席等。如苏北淮阴及泰州专区即组织了八千七百四十七个这样的小组；皖北光宿县专区，也组织了一千六百四十二个。
    以上都是一年来合作社工作在生产救灾中的成绩，以及合作社的组织与业务发展情形。
    二、在组织路线与经营方法上还有一些缺点
    在这一年来的工作中，合作社的组织和业务上，还存在着一些缺点与偏向。首先是有些地区不善于通过合作社的经济活动来领导生产救灾。不少地区的干部，仍只习惯于运用行政方法。如山东省惠济县灾民，对副业生产最初热情很高，但由于缺少合作社的通盘计划与组织，结果销路停滞，生产无法继续。又如冀东则发生这样的现象：政府克服了种种的困难，把救济粮运到灾村，因无合作社的组织领导，灾民只好自己把粮食背到市场上去交换生产工具，商贩则乘机低价收购。这些现象的发生，是由于某些地区领导机关不重视合作社工作的结果。
    其次是有些地区虽已有了合作社的组织，但由于对合作社应怎样正确地为灾民社员服务认识不足，或因计划性差，经营不善，结果对灾民困难仍未能很好的解决，并使合作社发展亦受到了阻碍。如有的合作社只强调业务经营，忽视组社工作；或者存在着单纯救济观点，忽视了业务的合理经营。皖北有些干部认为灾民无力集股，因而忽视了组织工作。又如有的合作社不顾社员群众在灾荒中粮柴缺乏等困难，而仍贩卖一些烟、酒及一些迷信品和化妆品。有些合作社没替灾民解决困难，此外更有些合作社干部忽视了对人民财产的保管和爱护，以致造成重大损失。如苏北射阳县供销部的皮棉霉烂达三十九担；如东县利民社囤粮，霉烂麦子一千二百斤等等。这些缺点和偏向，必须坚决予以纠正。
    三、总结经验教训准备预防灾荒
    去年的灾荒虽然胜利地度过了。但是今年有些地区又发生了新的灾害。最近皖北的大水，淹了田地一千三百万亩；河北滏阳河及大清河决口，被淹村庄五千多个，土地一千八百多万亩；其他地区多少也有一些程度不等的水灾。因此，必须总结过去的经验教训，继续加强生产救灾工作，并有组织有计划地进行预防灾荒。
    首先，各级领导干部应重视合作社工作在生产救灾中的作用。各地除党政机关及各团体应积极加强对合作社的领导外，并应调派有力干部，适当抽拨资金，帮助群众健全合作社机构，加强计划性，改善其业务经营。特别是上级社应经常深入下级社检查督促，帮助解决各项工作中的具体问题和困难。
    第二，生产救灾工作中的主要困难是产品销路问题。解决这一困难的办法，除国营部门应积极的在收购、价格、贷款等方面加以扶植外，合作社本身应根据当地产销情况，主动地到各地寻找销路，并力求采用合同制来保证有计划的经营；采取远距离推销，进行与产粮区交换等办法，也是可能和有效的。有些分散零星的产品，国营企业及合作社在力量不能全部收购时，则应指导并帮助社员自己运销，在业务上要采取薄利广销；并切实防止以过高价格收购产品的恩赐观点，以免发生滞销现象。
    第三，供销业务中的资金来源，主要的必须依靠和组织群众自己的资金力量；同时国家采取以下几种方式予以支持也是必要的：如（一）政府专款扶持；（二）银行发放较长期无利或低利贷款；（三）由救灾委员会拨一部分救济粮充作合作社收购资金；（四）上级社调拨资金收购灾区产品，并加速资金周转；（五）国营贸易部门的委托、收购、定货及往来款的资金。
    从多方面扩大业务增加资金是必要的，但须防止基层社对上级社拨款的依赖思想。
    第四，灾区合作社应积极提倡有销路的副业生产，同时结合较长期性的农业生产。农业生产虽是生产过程中较长期的根本办法；但当救灾如救火的严重情况下，则主要的只有依靠较短期性的副业生产增加收入，才能迅速有效地战胜灾荒。而领导副业生产又是一件极其琐碎细微的工作，这点已为我们一年来的经验所证明了。过去各地虽然也曾以大力普遍开展副业生产，获得一些效果；但有的地区却因缺乏预见性，在灾情严重时，表现了束手无策。有的副业生产则缺乏组织与领导，以致产品标准质量差，影响销路而垮台。合作社扶持副业的主要环节，在于积极供给原料，推销成品。
