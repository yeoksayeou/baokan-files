　　Over 6,000 People from Revolutionary University and Other Schools Gather to Welcome Korean Youth Representatives

    [Reported by this newspaper] Over 6,000 faculty, staff, and students from the North China People's Revolutionary University, the Labor University Foreign Language Training Class, and the Foreign Language School jointly held a meeting on September 8th to welcome the Korean representative of the World Democratic Youth League delegation, the Korean combat hero Jeon Jong-hwan, who received the First Class National Flag Order of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At the meeting, Jeon Jong-hwan reported on the current situation in Korea and his heroic and exemplary deeds in the just war of liberation to defend the independence, freedom, and honor of the motherland. In his report, he first expressed: He felt unparalleled excitement and happiness to be able to gather with the young people of China, our dear neighbor, and on behalf of the Korean youth, extended his highest respect and greetings to the Chinese youth who are supporting the Korean people. Jeon Jong-hwan introduced the consistent desire of the Korean people to yearn for and strive for peace and the reunification of their motherland, and reported on how the American imperialists and their running dogs, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang, launched a barbaric and bloody war of aggression, disregarding the will of the Korean people; and reported on how the Korean people on the front lines and in the rear fought and worked for their motherland with selfless spirit. He said: No matter what position they are in, the Korean people ask themselves this question at all times: "In the arduous struggle for the liberation of the motherland, how much effort have you put in?" and believe that fighting stubbornly against U.S. imperialism is an obligation that every Korean person should fulfill. After Jeon Jong-hwan's report, representatives from various units presented flowers, gifts, and flags to pay tribute to the heroic Korean youth.
