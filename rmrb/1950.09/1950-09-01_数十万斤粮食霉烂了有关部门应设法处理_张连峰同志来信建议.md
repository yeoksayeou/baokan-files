　　Tens of Thousands of Jin of Grain Have Molded; Relevant Departments Should Find Ways to Handle It - Letter of Suggestion from Comrade Zhang Lianfeng

Comrade Editor:

　　I am telling you about a case of a large batch of grain becoming infested with insects and mold, hoping it can be published in the newspaper, and asking relevant departments to promptly find ways to handle it:

　　After the unification of national financial and economic work, all public grain is centrally allocated. We support this decision. We hope that the central grain departments will pay attention to the situation of grain in our county's warehouses. Our county's warehouses have about 400,000 jin of millet and 30,000 jin of rice. Due to the rainy weather in Pingyuan Province, most of it has become infested with insects, and the rice has become stale due to moisture (the warehouse has already suggested this to higher authorities, but no measures have been taken). In order to deal with this batch of millet, the warehouse once set a deadline to distribute it to cadres and staff in various organs, which resulted in their dissatisfaction; when distributed to workers, the workers were also not satisfied. Everyone gets a headache when public millet is mentioned. It is also difficult to sell, and the price is very low (before the wheat harvest, one jin of rice could be worth more than one jin of wheat; now the market price of wheat is 10,000 yuan per dou, while millet is only 7,000 yuan per dou), causing great losses to state property.

　　I suggest that the central grain departments, based on the climatic conditions of various regions, give early instructions on how to deal with grain in various regions, so as to avoid greater losses to the country's grain.

### 数十万斤粮食霉烂了有关部门应设法处理  张连峰同志来信建议

　　数十万斤粮食霉烂了有关部门应设法处理
    张连峰同志来信建议编辑同志：
    我告诉你一个大批粮食生虫霉烂的事件，希望在报上发表，并请有关部门及时设法处理：
    全国财经工作统一后，所有公粮统归中央调拨。这一决定，我们是拥护的。我们希望中央粮食部门注意我县库粮的情况。我县仓库有四十万斤左右小米，三万斤大米，因平原省多雨，大半已生虫，且因受潮米已变味（该仓已向上级建议，但没有设法处理）。仓库为了处理这批小米，曾限期发给各机关干部工作人员，结果引起他们的不满；发给工人，工人也不满意。提起公家小米，谁都头痛啦。卖也不好卖，价格很低（麦收前一斤米可抵一斤麦子还多；现在麦子市价一万元一斗，小米却是七千元一斗。）使国家财产受到极大损失。
    我建议中央粮食部门，要根据各地气候条件，对各地粮食及早指示处理办法，以免国家的粮食遭受更大的损失。
