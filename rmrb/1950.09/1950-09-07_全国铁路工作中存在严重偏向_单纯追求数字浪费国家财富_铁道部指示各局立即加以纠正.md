　　Serious Deviation Exists in National Railway Work
    Solely Pursuing Numbers Wastes National Wealth
    Ministry of Railways Instructs All Bureaus to Correct Immediately
    [This Newspaper Reported] At present, the national railway work is generally plagued by a deviation: the pursuit of numbers while neglecting quality, causing significant losses to state property. The overall goal of railway transportation work is to shorten vehicle turnaround rates and reduce costs. However, some management bureaus, solely to showcase transportation efficiency, often pull freight trains with insufficient traction, severely wasting locomotive traction power. The national locomotive traction power wastage reaches one-third. The Huayin and Baoji sections of the Xi'an Railway Bureau use the 冂ㄎ-1 type locomotive, which in April averaged less than 900 tons per train, while the actual locomotive can pull 1,800 tons, wasting half of the traction power. Some places, in order to complete the turnaround rate and increase daily car kilometers, run locomotives without any train cars attached (single-engine running). In June, the country ran single-engine runs 2,489 times, traveling more than 149,000 kilometers, wasting approximately 2,980 tons of coal for fuel alone.

    Some management bureaus, in order to pursue the number of loaded cars, heavily load ballast even when the supply of goods is insufficient. The Shanghai Bureau even transports years of accumulated furnace ash to make up the numbers. Therefore, in the first half of this year, the national railway's commercial freight volume only completed 36.3 percent of the annual plan, while the volume of railway-owned goods completed 85.6 percent of the annual plan, reducing business income.

    Since the implementation of the new track maintenance method nationwide on January 1 this year, by the end of July, although the north-south railways had completed 495 kilometers of major repairs, 4,214 kilometers of medium repairs, and 8,681 kilometers of regular repairs in terms of quantity, the quality of many repairs did not meet the standards. Furthermore, the leadership did not correctly grasp the spirit of the new track maintenance method, causing the track maintenance work to be biased towards major repairs while neglecting the central link of track maintenance: regular repairs; biased towards contracted repairs, while neglecting contracted maintenance and inspection work. The patrol system has been established, but it has become a mere formality. As a result, the number of engineering accidents in the second quarter increased by 150 cases compared to the 327 cases in the first quarter.

    In locomotive and factory work, the tendency to pursue numbers is even more pronounced. Many railway factories have turned production competitions into crash programs in order to complete their tasks ahead of schedule. The Changxindian Railway Factory worked more than 99,000 overtime hours from January to June. The Taiyuan Railway Factory advocated "typhoon and torrential rain-style crash work," causing employees to be overworked. In May and June, patients accounted for 29 percent of the total number of employees. The result of this desperate rush is that the quality of repairs is low. Six locomotives that had just been repaired and left the Jinan Railway Locomotive Factory in June were found to be of poor quality and needed to be reworked. The locomotive departments pay attention to operational achievements in order to improve daily car kilometers, but neglect locomotive quality. Except for a few model locomotives, the quality of general locomotives cannot be improved rapidly, and major accidents continue to occur.

    After discovering this serious deviation of pursuing numbers and neglecting quality, the Ministry of Railways has paid attention to correcting it in its own work and has repeatedly instructed all railway bureaus to immediately prevent this tendency of pure task-orientedness and formalism, to consolidate existing achievements by improving quality, and to implement the idea of economic accounting. The Political Department of the Ministry of Railways issued a rectification instruction, requiring party members and cadres at all levels to pay attention to examining and overcoming this deviation in order to improve railway work a step further.

　　全国铁路工作中存在严重偏向
    单纯追求数字浪费国家财富
    铁道部指示各局立即加以纠正
    【本报讯】目前全国铁路工作中普遍存在追求数字，忽视质量的偏向，使国家财产遭受重大损失。铁路运输工作总的目标是缩短车辆周转率，减低成本。但有些管理局单纯为了表现运输效率，往往把不足牵引量的货物列车拉走，严重浪费机车牵引力。全国机车牵引力浪费竟达三分之一。西安铁路分局华阴、宝鸡段使用的冂ㄎ一型机车，四月份平均每列牵引不到九百吨，而实际这台机车可以牵引一千八百吨，牵引力浪费了一半。有些地方为了完成周转率和提高日车公里，加跑单机（不拉车辆的机车）。六月份全国共跑单机二千四百八十九次，走行十四万九千余公里，仅燃煤一项即浪费约两千九百八十余吨。
    有些管理局为了追求装车数的数字，在货源不多的情况下，便大装石碴，上海局竟运多年积存的炉灰来凑数。所以在今年上半年全国铁路营业品运输量仅完成全年计划的百分之三十六点三，而路用品运输量却完成全年计划的百分之八十五点六。减少了营业收入。
    自今年一月一日全国实行新养路法以后，截至七月底，在数量上南北铁路虽已完成了大修四百九十五公里，中修四千二百十四公里，经常补修八千六百八十一公里，但质量多不合标准，并且领导上没有正确掌握新养路法的精神，使养路工作偏重大修，而放松养路的中心环节的经常补修工作；偏重包修，忽视了包养包检工作。巡道制建立了，却流于形式。因此工务事故在第二季中反较第一季三二七件增加了一百五十件。
    在机务和厂务工作中，追求数字的倾向更为显著。很多铁路工厂为了提前完成任务，把生产竞赛搞成突击运动。长辛店铁路工厂一月至六月加班九万九千多小时，太原铁路工厂提倡“狂风暴雨式的突击工作”，使员工过度劳累，五六月中病员为总人数百分之二十九。这种拚命突击的结果，使得检修质量低下。济南铁路机厂六月份刚修好出厂的机车，就发现六台质量不佳，需要反工。机务部门为了提高日车公里，注意运转成绩，但忽视机车质量，除个别模范机车外，一般机车质量不能迅速提高，重大事故依然不断发生。
    铁道部发现这种严重的追求数字，忽视质量的偏向以后，已注意在部的工作中纠正，并一再指示各路局，应立即防止这种单纯任务观点和形式主义的倾向，从提高质量中，巩固既有成绩，贯彻经济核算思想。铁道部政治部发布整风指示，要求各级党员干部注意检查并克服这一偏向，以便把铁路工作提高一步。（林印）
