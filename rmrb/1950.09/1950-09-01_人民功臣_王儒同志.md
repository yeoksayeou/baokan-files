　　People's Hero - Comrade Wang Ru
    Shi Tongwen, Suo Fei
    When a communist party member truly dedicates himself to the cause of the Party and the people, he will certainly be able to excellently complete any task given to him by the Party and higher organizations. Comrade Wang Ru, a people's hero and the squadron leader of the Fifth Squadron of the First Battalion of the Beijing Garrison Corps, is a typical example of someone who fights and works selflessly. In the army, he is a famous combat hero; in school, he is a model student; and in his work guarding the capital, he is a model worker.
            I. Hero on the Battlefield
    In April 1947, during the battle to liberate Zhengding County, Hebei Province, by the People's Liberation Army's Jin-Cha-Ji Field Army, Comrade Wang Ru was awarded a special-class merit. The Seventh Company of the Fourteenth Regiment, where he served, was awarded the title of "First Company to Scale Zhengding City."
    On April 9th, after the battle began, the enemy's outer strongholds were quickly cleared. The Fourth Squad of the Seventh Company was assigned the task of scaling the city wall for a surprise attack. At that time, Wang Ru was the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Squad. After accepting this glorious task, the Fourth Squad immediately held a "Zhuge Liang Meeting" to formulate a battle plan. The Fourth Squad had a total of seven people: Squad Leader Liu Hai led three soldiers as the first assault group; Deputy Squad Leader Wang Ru led two soldiers as the second assault group. Before the battle, Comrade Wang Ru and all the squad members swore to the Party: "We would rather die on the city wall than under it, and even if only one person is left, we will complete the task of scaling the city!"
    On the third day (April 11th), the battle to attack the city began. After the Seventh Squad soldiers erected the siege ladder, Liu Hai's first assault group charged up first. Before reaching the top of the ladder, all the soldiers in the group were wounded and slid down the ropes on the ladder. At this time, both sides concentrated their firepower and fired fiercely, and the situation was very tense. At this moment, Comrade Wang Ru led the second assault group and charged up despite the enemy's dense firepower. As he approached the top of the city wall, he only had one grenade and one bullet left. He accepted the experience of the first assault group, knowing that to get onto the city wall, he had to first blow up the enemies on the battlements. When he was only three or four feet away from the bayonet sticking out of the battlements, he aimed at the enemy and threw his only grenade. With the explosion of the grenade, three or four enemies inside the battlements were blown down, and Wang Ru was the first to climb onto the top of the city wall. Including the first assault group, it only took fifteen minutes. As soon as Wang Ru stood firm, an enemy platoon leader led forty or fifty bandit soldiers to counterattack him, shooting at him, and two or three people had already rushed close. At this critical moment, although Comrade Wang Ru only had one bullet left, he did not panic at all. He clearly remembered the words of the regiment political commissar: "In order to liberate the suffering people in Zhengding City, comrades must charge bravely and resolutely complete the task of a surprise attack to scale the city." He also remembered his oath: "As long as we get on the city wall, we will never retreat! ... We would rather die on the city wall than under it!" He clenched his teeth, gripped his Type 38 rifle, loaded his only bullet, and prepared to shoot one enemy first, and then fight with bayonets. At this moment, those cowardly enemies were all scared and retreated. When the enemy platoon leader forced seven or eight enemies to charge up for the second time, Comrade Wang Ru also rushed forward two or three steps and directed the whole group to climb onto the city wall. The cowardly enemies were again frightened and shrank back. Wang Ru took the opportunity to pick up two grenades from the dead enemy bodies and threw them at the enemy. They exploded, some enemies were blown down, and others were so frightened that they retreated in confusion. At this time, the assault group had sent grenades to Wang Ru. He couldn't bother pulling the pin with his hand, so he bit it with his mouth and threw it out, immediately driving the enemy into a rout. Wang Ru took advantage of the victory to raise his bayonet and chase after them, and the enemy fled even more frantically. This allowed the follow-up troops to successively climb onto the city wall, drive the enemy off the city wall, and consolidate and expand the breakthrough. Within an hour, they captured more than a dozen large and small bunkers, occupied more than 300 meters of the position, and blew open the south gate, opening up a path for the main force to advance. After this battle, Wang Ru was awarded a special-class merit. From then on, the heroic name of "Wang Ru" spread everywhere. And at this time, he was still a new soldier who had been in the army for less than two years, and had only joined the Party for just over a year.
    In the autumn of 1947, in the battles to attack Cangxian and Xushui, Comrade Wang Ru also received war merits and honors. After the Zhengding battle, the troops moved between Hebei and Shanxi provinces, and finally reached Yuci. And during the long march, Comrade Wang Ru showed a high degree of hard work, endurance, and class friendship. Along the way, he helped others carry backpacks and rifles, and always carried more things than others. He also took the initiative to conduct political education for new soldiers and liberated soldiers, ensuring the consolidation of the entire squad and the morale. When the entire brigade held a celebration meeting, Wang Ru and the Fourth Squad were praised again. The entire brigade was called upon to learn from the model squad in consolidating the troops.
            II. Model Student
    In order to cultivate and improve this outstanding communist party member and model people's soldier, the Party transferred Wang Ru to the Second Column's training school in the winter of 1947 to study. In school, he did not consider himself a special-class hero, but humbly studied military theory and tactics in order to maintain his honor. He often used the determination he made in the front to examine himself: "Guarantee to study well, improve combat capability, and never fail the cultivation of the Party and superiors and the hopes of comrades." In his studies, he has always been serious in learning and research, and paid special attention to using his spare time to study culture in order to improve his ability to study military and political affairs. Here is a vivid example to illustrate Comrade Wang Ru's spirit of learning. He is from Chahar, and in the past he did not come into contact with many people, and it was not easy for others to hear him clearly when he spoke. In the front, he simply did not speak. In this study, he also wanted to overcome this shortcoming. He used game time to learn to speak. He ran to the vegetable field and treated the entire row of cabbages as troops, practicing speaking to them. Although some people laughed at him, he persisted in practicing like this. Coupled with his efforts in political and cultural studies, after four or five months, he was able to explain current affairs while holding a newspaper. This spirit of actively learning was often praised by his superiors. When he graduated, his grades were all in the top rank, and he was considered a model student. After graduation, the school therefore retained him at the school to serve as the squadron leader.
            III. Hero of Guarding the Capital
    In February 1949, when Beijing was liberated, the school was ordered to undertake the task of garrisoning and policing Beijing. He understood the importance of urban guard work, and made a guarantee at the cadre meeting: 1. Not be affected by the colorful world of the city. 2. Never violate policies and disciplines. 3. Strictly manage and educate the troops. 4. Be vigilant and protect the safety of the people of Beijing. After entering the city, their Second Squadron was stationed in Xicheng and was responsible for the garrison and policing tasks in the inner Second District. When Beijing was first liberated, social order was very chaotic, and there were many scattered soldiers and bandits, and robberies occurred frequently. During this period, Comrade Wang Ru led the police officers day and night to understand the situation, set up sentry posts, investigate cases, and establish close contact with the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau. In the three months after entering the city, he worked diligently to perform his duties, solved many robberies, and often educated the troops to be conscientious and responsible and maintain policies and disciplines. When the police corps evaluated merits, the Second Squadron was awarded two minor merits. Comrade Wang Ru was recognized for his achievements in leading the work of the squadron, and was also awarded two minor merits at the cadre meeting.
    Three months later, Comrade Wang Ru was transferred to serve as the deputy company commander of the First Company. The duty of the deputy company commander is administrative management: he must be responsible for the management and education of the troops, and also be in charge of thrift, hygiene, and pay attention to improving the food. The task is heavy and complex. Although in the first month or so, because he was unfamiliar with the situation, his work was a bit hectic and his achievements were not great. But Comrade Wang Ru was not discouraged by this. He often thought: "How can I do my job well?" He examined his biggest problem: lack of organization and planning in his work, doing things blindly, and not knowing how to promote the organization. He accepted the suggestions given to him by the Party branch committee: strengthen the planning of his work and be good at promoting the organization. From then on, he always consulted the company commander and political instructor before doing anything, then studied it with the squadron cadres, humbly solicited everyone's opinions, and then formulated a plan, which was implemented after being approved by the Party branch committee. In the implementation of the plan, he was also able to constantly listen to the opinions of the leaders and the masses, and improve his work in a timely manner. In the past year, under the leadership of Comrade Wang Ru, the administrative management work of the First Company, whether it was thrift, hygiene, improving food, or life management, has made great progress. The First Company has once again become a model company and won the "Light of the Company" award flag.
    In June of this year, Comrade Wang Ru was promoted to company commander of the Fifth Company. The duty of the company commander is mainly responsible for policing and guard work. For him, this is another new task. As soon as he arrived at the Fifth Company, he was assigned the important task of guarding the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee and the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Therefore, he often stayed up late, continuously checking the duty, and finally completed the task of guarding the two major conferences seriously and responsibly.
    Humbly accepting the opinions of the masses and uniting comrades is another aspect of Comrade Wang Ru's excellent work style. He respects his superiors, is sincere and humble to his colleagues, and cares for and loves his subordinates. The political instructor in his company was in poor health, and Wang Ru took care of him in every way in his life. When distributing things, he always chose the bad ones first and gave the good ones to others; when there were heavy work tasks, he always rushed to do them first, and he cared for the soldiers very much. For example, last autumn, he always went to check each squad once after the lights were turned off to see if everyone was covered with quilts and if everyone had closed the windows and doors before he could sleep peacefully. Under the influence of Comrade Wang Ru's excellent work style, the cadres of the Fifth Company were therefore very united. No matter who had opinions on the work or on that cadre, they could raise them directly, and the other party could accept and correct them.
    Comrade Wang Ru was a special-class hero in the front, a model student in school, and a model worker in the rear. After arriving in Beijing, many universities invited him to give speeches, and he also represented the garrison troops to attend the Beijing Municipal People's Congress. He was also promoted from squadron leader to company commander in his work, but he never showed any pride because of this. On the contrary, he knew that his responsibility had increased, and he behaved even more humbly and cautiously. Once, he saw that a comrade who had made meritorious service with him in a battle was criticized by the Party newspaper for beating a worker. He held that newspaper and read it several times, and said vigilantly: "We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, always maintain the honor of a meritorious person, and never be proud!"

　　人民功臣——王儒同志
    史同文　索扉
    一个共产党员，当他真正把自己献给党与人民的事业后，他就一定可以出色地完成党和上级组织所给予他的任何任务。人民功臣、北京纠察总队第一大队五中队中队长王儒同志，就是这样忘我地战斗和工作的一个典型例子。在部队里，他是有名的战斗英雄；在学校中，他是学习模范；在警卫首都的工作中，他又是一个模范工作者。
            一、战场上的英雄
    一九四七年四月，人民解放军晋察冀野战部队解放河北正定县城的战役中，王儒同志立了特等功，他所在的十四团七连荣获“正定登城首功连”的称号。
    四月九日战斗开始后，很快就扫清了敌人的外围据点。七连四班担任爬城突击的任务。当时王儒是四班副班长。四班接受了这个光荣任务后，随即召开“诸葛亮会”，拟定战斗计划。四班共七个人，班长刘海带三个战士为第一突击小组；副班长王儒带两个战士为第二突击小组。战斗前，王儒同志和全班战友一同向党宣誓：“宁肯死在城上，也不死在城下，剩下一人也要完成登城任务！”
    第三天（十一日）下午，攻城战斗开始了。七班战士把登城云梯架起后，刘海第一突击小组首先冲上去。未爬到梯子顶，小组的战士就都负了伤，顺着梯子头上的绳子溜下来。这时双方集中火力猛烈射击，情况十分紧张。就在这时，王儒同志领着第二突击小组，冒着敌人密集的火力冲上去。当他接近城头时，他已打剩了一颗手榴弹和一发子弹，他接受了第一突击小组的经验，知道要上城就得先把垛口上的敌人炸死。在离垛口里伸出来的刺刀有三四尺远时，他对准敌人就把仅有的一颗手榴弹打上去了。随着手榴弹的爆炸，垛口内三四个敌人都被炸倒了，王儒就第一个爬上了城头。连第一突击小组在内，前后才十五分钟时间，王儒刚站住，敌军一个排长指挥着四五十个匪军，就向他反扑过来，对准他射击，并有两三个人已冲近来了。在这千钧一发的紧急关头，王儒同志虽然只剩了一颗子弹却丝毫没有慌张，他清楚地记着团政委的话：“为了解放正定城里的苦难人民，同志们要勇猛的冲锋，坚决完成突击登城任务。”同时也记起了自己的誓言：“只要登上城去，宁死不退！………宁肯死在城上，也不能死在城下！”他就咬紧牙关，握紧三八枪，把仅有的一粒子弹推上膛去，准备先打死一个，然后再拚刺刀。就在这时，那几个怯弱的敌人都被吓得退回去了。在敌军排长第二次逼迫着七八个敌人冲上来时，王儒同志也往前冲了两三步，并指挥着全组人上城，怯懦的敌人又被吓得缩回去了。王儒乘机在敌人的死尸身上拾取了两枚手榴弹向敌人扔去。爆炸了，有的敌人被炸倒了，有的被吓得手足无措地纷纷倒退回去。这时突击组已给王儒送过手榴弹来。他已顾不得用手拉弦，就用嘴咬了打出去，立即把敌人打得狼狈四逃。王儒乘胜端起刺刀就追过去，敌人更是慌张地逃跑，这样使得后续部队得以陆续登上城来，把城上的敌人打下城去，巩固和扩大了突破口。一小时内攻克了大小十多个堡垒，占领了三百多米长的阵地，并炸开了南城门，给主力部队开辟了前进的道路。在这一战役结束后，王儒被记了特等功。从此，“王儒”这个英雄的名字到处传播。而这时他还是个参军不满两年的新战士，入党也才一年多。
    一九四七年秋在攻打沧县、徐水的战役中，王儒同志都获得了战功荣誉。正定战役后，部队转战冀、晋两省，最后打到榆次。并且在长途行军中，王儒同志表现了高度的刻苦耐劳和阶级友爱精神。一路上帮助别人背背包、掮大枪，身上的东西总是比别人多几件。并且主动地向新战士、解放战士进行政治教育，保证了全班的巩固和士气的旺盛。当全旅召开庆功大会时，又表扬了王儒，表扬了第四班。号召全旅向巩固部队的模范班学习。
            二、学习模范
    党为了培养提高这个优秀的共产党员，模范的人民战士，一九四七年冬，调王儒到二纵队随营学校学习。在学校中，他并不以特等功臣自居，而是虚心地学习军事理论和战术，以保持自己的荣誉。他时常以自己在前方下的决心来检查自己：“保证学习好，提高战斗能力，决不辜负党和上级的培养和同志们的希望。”在学习中，他一直是认真的学习研究，并特别注意利用课余时间学习文化，以提高学习军事政治的能力。这里有个生动的例子，说明了王儒同志学习的精神，他是察哈尔人，过去接触的人不多，说起话来不容易使别人听清，在前方时他索性不说话。在这次学习中他也要克服这个缺点。他就利用游戏时间学习讲话，他跑到菜畦面前把整排的白菜当作部队，对着它们练习讲话。虽然有些人笑他，但他坚持着这样练习。加上政治文化学习的努力，四五个月以后，他就能够拿着报纸讲解时事了。这种积极学习的精神，经常受到上级的表扬。毕业时他的成绩都在甲等，被认为学习模范。毕业后，学校因此留他在学校担任区队长的职务。
            三、警卫首都的功臣
    一九四九年二月北京解放，学校奉命担负了卫戍京市的纠察任务。他懂得城市警卫工作的重要，在干部会上提出保证：一、不受城市花花绿绿影响。二、决不违犯政策纪律。三、严格部队的管理教育。四、提高警惕，保护北京人民的安全。入城后，他们二区队驻西城，担负内二区的卫戍纠察任务。北京刚解放时，社会秩序很乱，散兵游勇很多，经常发生抢案。当时公安部队兵力薄弱，勤务繁重。这期间，王儒同志整天整夜的带领纠察队员了解情况，布置岗哨，调查案件，并和公安二分局取得密切联系。入城三个月中，他兢兢业业执行任务，破获了多起抢案，并且经常教育部队要认真负责，维护政策纪律。在纠察总队评功时，二区队立了两小功。王儒同志领导区队工作有成绩，干部会上也被评了两小功。
    三个月后，王儒同志调任为一中队副中队长。副中队长的职务是行政管理：要负责部队的管理教育，又要掌握节约、卫生，注意改善伙食。任务繁重而复杂。虽然在最初一个多月中，因为情况不熟，工作有些忙乱，成绩也不大。但王儒同志并未因此灰心，他常想：“怎样才能把工作作好呢？”他检讨出了自己最大的毛病：工作上缺乏组织计划，盲目干，不会推动组织。他接受了支委会给他的建议：加强工作的计划性，要善于推动组织。从此以后，他有事总是先请教队长、政治指导员，再和区队干部一起研究，虚心征求大家意见，然后拟定计划，经支委会同意后，再贯彻执行。在执行计划中，又能不断听取领导上和群众的意见，及时改进工作。一年来，在王儒同志领导下，一中队的行政管理工作，无论是节约、卫生、改善伙食及生活管理等，都有了很大的成绩。一中队又成为模范连队，荣获了“连队之光”奖旗一面。
    今年六月，王儒同志调升为五中队中队长。中队长的职务主要是负责纠察警卫工作。对他说来，这又是一个新的工作任务。刚到五中队，就担负了警卫三中全会和政协全国委员会第二次会议的重要任务。因此他常常半夜不睡觉，连续检查勤务，终于严肃认真的完成了保卫两大会议的任务。
    虚心接受群众意见，团结同志，是王儒同志优良作风的又一面。他对上级尊重、对同级诚恳谦虚、对下级关心爱护。他队里的政治指导员身体不好，在生活上王儒对他处处关心体贴。发东西时总是自己先挑坏的，把好的让给别人；有繁重的工作任务时，总是抢先去作，对战士非常爱护，例如去年秋天，他总在吹熄灯号后，要到各班检查一次，看看大家被子盖好没有，看看大家把窗门关上没有，然后才能安心睡觉。在王儒同志这种优良作风的影响下，五中队干部因此非常团结。不论谁对工作或对那个干部有意见，都能正面提出，对方也能接受改正。
    王儒同志在前方是特等功臣，在学校是学习模范，在后方是工作模范，到北京后，许多大学请他去讲演，又代表卫戍部队出席北京市各界人民代表会议，在工作上也由区队长升任为中队长，但他从未因此而有丝毫骄傲。相反地，他知道自己的责任加重了，表现得更加谦逊谨慎。有一次，他看到和自己在一次战斗中立功的一位同志因为打了工人而受到党报的批评。他拿着那张报看了好几次，很警惕地说：“可得牢牢记住毛主席教导我们的话，要永远保持功臣的荣誉，千万不要骄傲啊！”
