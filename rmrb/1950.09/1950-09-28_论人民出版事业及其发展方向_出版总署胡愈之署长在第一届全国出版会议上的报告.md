I. The People's Publishing Undertaking Grows Up in the Revolutionary Struggle

　　Chairman Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese people have always been a great, brave, and diligent nation."

　　This is also true from the perspective of the publishing industry.

　　When people all over the world were still using clay tablets, reeds, and parchment as books, our ancestors had already invented papermaking and woodblock printing.

　　The world's first book printed in black ink on white paper was published in China, a result of the labor and creativity of the Chinese people.

　　The diligent Chinese people not only created excellent publishing technology but also worked on publishing with a serious and conscientious attitude. Textual research, collation, compilation, and translation of books have long become specialized professions unique to China. We must thank the publishing workers of previous generations, who enabled a large portion of China's long-standing cultural heritage and rich labor production experience to be preserved to this day.

　　However, in the era ruled by the feudal landlord class, the development of the publishing industry was extremely limited. Throughout history, all reactionary ruling classes have consistently adopted a policy of keeping the people ignorant. Books and records were used as tools for "carrying the Tao" and "defending the Tao." The so-called "Tao" was the "Tao" of the exploiting classes, the "Tao" of the feudal landlord class, which ran counter to the interests of the masses. Books and knowledge were monopolized by a few, and the publishing industry had no possibility of large-scale development.

　　After the Opium War, China began to have lithography, letterpress printing, color printing, and translated and published new academic books. From the end of the 19th century, China also had new-style printing houses, joint-venture bookstores, and periodicals. This was learned from capitalist countries. Some new books and periodicals published at that time introduced the democratic ideas and science and technology of the Western bourgeoisie, which promoted the initial democratic revolution and cultural enlightenment movement. Although the initial publishing industry was also infected with the viruses of capitalism, most books and periodicals, apart from a very few excellent works, only pursued market demands and catered to the low tastes of the petty bourgeoisie, and were not suitable for the needs of the masses. However, the entrepreneurial management of publishing and distribution and the modernization of printing technology and equipment laid the foundation during this period.

　　As for the new people's publishing undertaking, it began to sprout from the May Fourth Movement and grew up in the struggle in coordination with the entire process of the new democratic revolution. After the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese people found the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and embarked on the path of anti-imperialist and anti-feudal liberation. Starting with "New Youth Magazine" and "The Guide Weekly," progressive books and publications became weapons of revolutionary struggle and combined with the demands of the masses. The revolutionary publishing industry was still very weak at that time and suffered from the destruction and oppression of reactionary forces, but its enormous influence and role in awakening the Chinese people is incalculable.

　　The Kuomintang reactionary group's twenty years of rule strangled the publishing freedom of the Chinese people. Throughout the Kuomintang-controlled areas, Americanized, obscene, and poisonous books and periodicals that praised imperialism and flattered the enemies of the people were popular on the market, while beneficial reading materials needed by the people were severely censored and prohibited. Progressive bookstores, newspapers, and magazines were sealed up and confiscated, and the people's writers and publishing workers suffered countless massacres, detentions, and persecutions.

　　However, no matter how brutal and vicious the reactionary ruling class was, it could not stop the growth and development of the new people's publishing undertaking. On the one hand, progressive writers and publishers, in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, used their pens as guns and paper bullets as bullets, and fought a long-term and resolute struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in an open and secret way, establishing an indestructible revolutionary camp of the people in the cultural publishing field. Two great names were left in this regard—Lu Xun and Zou Taofen.

　　On the other hand, revolutionary writers and revolutionary publishing workers, starting from the land revolution period, established the foundation of the revolutionary publishing industry in the revolutionary base areas, and published a large number of books and periodicals in extremely tense war conditions, and did an excellent job in disseminating Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and in the cultural and political education of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Mao Zedong's banner became the banner of revolutionary publishing workers. From the War of Resistance Against Japan to the War of Liberation, the cultural publishing industry declined in the Kuomintang areas and continued to develop in the liberated areas. In a difficult environment with extremely scarce material conditions, Xinhua Bookstore supplied a large quantity of excellent and rich spiritual food for the people and carried out the distribution of revolutionary books and periodicals in most of the liberated rural areas and the People's Liberation Army troops, which was welcomed by the broad masses.

　　It must be mentioned here that the friendly Soviet Union has given great assistance to China's people's publishing undertaking. The Moscow Foreign Languages Publishing House published the Chinese version of the classic works of Marxism-Leninism, which greatly improved the political and ideological education of the Chinese people and the theoretical level of general cadres.

　　Undeniably, the revolutionary people's publishing work in the past 30 years, under the leadership, call, and influence of the Communist Party of China, has played a huge role in the awakening, unity, progress, and unification of the broad masses of the Chinese people, and it has become an indispensable part of the great cause of people's liberation.

　　The people have awakened, the people have united, and the people have won. The liberation of most areas of China, the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the convening of the People's Political Consultative Conference, the establishment of the People's Republic of China and the Central People's Government, the complete unification of the entire country, the stability of currency and prices, the beginning of the improvement of the financial and economic situation, the steady advancement of the land reform in the countryside aimed at eliminating feudal exploitation, and the gradual restoration and development of industry and commerce in the cities, all of these have created favorable conditions and unlimited prospects for the development of all people's undertakings in China, and have also created favorable conditions and unlimited prospects for the development of the Chinese people's publishing undertaking. Although there are still some difficulties in publishing work that need to be overcome, the solid foundation of the new democratic people's publishing undertaking has been established. This foundation is indestructible, and the future is bright. As we drink water, we think of its source. We cannot but express our lofty respect to the pioneers, countless martyrs, and fighters of the Chinese people's publishing undertaking. There is no doubt that their heroic struggle and diligent work have been one of the important factors for the victory and success of the Chinese people's liberation cause.

II. Overview of the Publishing Industry After the Liberation of Major Cities Across the Country

　　After the People's Liberation War achieved victory throughout the country in 1949, the publishing industry appeared in a brand new look. The Kuomintang's reactionary ideological fortresses, such as the Zhengzhong Bookstore, Independent Publishing House, and China Cultural Service Society, were taken over by the people. Reactionary publications stopped publishing. The state-owned Xinhua Bookstore began to publish a large number of progressive books and periodicals with cities as the center. Workers and youth respectively established their own publishing houses. Other private capital-operated bookstores automatically purged some of the reactionary books they had printed before liberation. Feudal superstitious, low-taste, and harmful books and periodicals were gradually expelled from the market. Various revolutionary and scientific excellent reading materials are sold in large quantities throughout the country. The publishing industry is now no longer a tool used by the reactionary ruling class to deceive and numb the people, but an important fighting weapon in the spiritual life of the people of New China.

　　The newborn force is lively, healthy, and has the prospect of development. But it is still young, not yet strong, and has many difficulties and shortcomings to overcome.

　　Since the birth of the People's Republic of China, the publication, printing, and distribution of books and periodicals across the country can be explained in the following points:

　　(1) The number of books produced According to incomplete statistics, from January to June 1950, the country published a total of 2,619 kinds of books (excluding periodicals), 4,257 kinds of reprinted books, with a total of 95,224,516 copies printed. Among them, there were 57,633,186 copies of primary and secondary school textbooks. Excluding textbooks, the average number of copies printed for general books was 6,418 copies.

　　Judging from these figures, although the total number of books published in the first half of 1950 has increased compared with before liberation, it has not yet recovered to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan.

　　According to a survey at the end of June this year, there are a total of 426 public and private publishing institutions across the country, but only 185 of them published new books in the first half of this year. The production of the other 241 is in a state of stagnation or semi-stagnation.

　　It is estimated that 50% of the production capacity of printing factories specializing in printing books and periodicals nationwide is currently surplus. This also shows that the current number of books and periodicals produced has not yet recovered to the level before the War of Resistance Against Japan.

　　If the number of publications in the second half of the year is similar to that in the first half of the year, then the total number of books and magazines published nationwide in 1950 should be 200 million copies. On average, there is only one copy for every two or three people in the country. Compared with the Soviet Union's publication plan for this year, the total number of publications nationwide is 800 million copies, not including periodicals. On average, each person gets four new books, which is a big difference. If we compare the capacity of each book and the amount of paper used, our current publishing production is about ten times different from that of the Soviet Union.

　　(2) Publishing direction After the establishment of the Publishing Administration, it solicited samples of new books published and reprinted after the founding of the People's Republic of China from publishers across the country. By the end of July, a total of 4,960 kinds of sample books had been received, of which 2,088 kinds were published by public, joint public-private bookstores and organizations, and 2,872 kinds were published by private bookstores.

　　Distinguished by the content of publications, the percentages are as follows:

          Category                                Percentage
          Political Theory and Current Affairs      20.7
          Philosophy, Language, History, and Geography 11.6
          Natural Sciences and Applied Technology     17.1
          Literature and Art                         18.9
          School Textbooks                           6.5
          Popular Readings                           18.1
          Children's Books                           5.3
          Other                                      1.8

　　Among the 185 publishing houses (excluding Xinhua Bookstore, 15 public, 6 joint public-private, and 163 private) that are currently publishing new books nationwide, 94 publish literary and art books, of which 39 publish more than five kinds; 85 publish social science books, of which 28 publish more than five kinds; 39 publish natural science and applied technology books, of which 16 publish more than five kinds; and 88 publish popular readings, of which 32 publish more than five kinds. The above statistics are extremely incomplete. But in general, it can be seen that the main direction of publishing is literary and art books, followed by popular readings and social science books. The number of publishers of natural science and applied technology books is less than one-tenth of the total number of publishers.

　　Of the 928 literary and art books received by the end of July, literary theory accounted for 7%, literary creation accounted for 36%, translated works accounted for 35%, and drama, music, and fine arts accounted for 22%. In literary creation, new works are less than 100 kinds, and most of them are reprints of old creations. Translation mainly focuses on Soviet works, and the quantity is quite large, which is a feature of publishing during this period.

　　Social science books generally sell more copies than literary and art books. This is quite natural. Due to the upsurge of the nationwide learning movement, general cadres and readers in the newly liberated areas need political theory books more urgently than literary and art readings. The "Cadres' Must-Read," which contains twelve kinds of classic works of Marxism-Leninism, has been fully published, with a total of 3 million copies printed. The new edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" cannot be fully printed until now due to the heavy work of correcting and annotating. Readers across the country have been waiting for a long time. In the near future, the publication of this masterpiece will be a major event marking an era in China's publishing industry.

　　In addition to these, most of the books in the category of social sciences and political current affairs are pamphlets and loose-leaf books on policies and regulations. There are not many large-scale specialized works or translations. Political current affairs readings published this year are more uniform and neater than the versions last year, and errors in typesetting and proofreading have been greatly reduced. However, most of these books are compiled from policy documents, reports, and papers, and the content is often repetitive. This is unavoidable in the current situation.

　　The publishing industry's emphasis on popular readings for workers, peasants, and soldiers and children's books is only just beginning, but it has already yielded considerable results. In Beijing and Shanghai, public and private publishers have compiled and printed a large number of popular stories, songbooks, operas, comic strips, and other popular readings, which have gradually squeezed out the old and poisonous popular readings in the market. What is lacking is that the content is narrow and focuses on literature and art. There are too few introductions to scientific, technological, historical, geographical, financial, and economic knowledge. Continuing this work has great prospects.

　　The publication of natural science and applied technology books has not yet attracted the attention of the general publishing industry. Among the newly published natural science books, there are only a few translations and some intermediate-level readings. There are also very few books on finance, economics, and applied social sciences.

　　After liberation, various reference books, such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, and maps, are in urgent need. Many old publications must be revised. Some publishers, in order to cater to market demand, reprint old versions with a changed appearance, which caused widespread dissatisfaction and criticism among readers. If publishers revise old reference books and recompile new reference books with a serious and conscientious attitude, it would be of great help to our readers.

　　After liberation, the publication of school textbooks was quite chaotic. The versions used in various places were not uniform, and the supply was not timely. This autumn, the Central Ministry of Education and the Publishing Administration made a decision to first unify the versions of primary school books and middle school language, history, and geography textbooks and lower the prices. In the near future, under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Education and the Publishing Administration, a People's Education Publishing House will be established to gradually unify the editing and publishing of textbooks nationwide. However, since the current school system and curriculum standards have not yet been determined, it is not possible to uniformly compile, print, and adopt textbooks nationwide in a certain period of time. Therefore, at present, private publishers are allowed to compile and print textbooks for sale after being reviewed by the Ministry of Education.

　　Generally speaking, the publishing situation after liberation is completely different. Public and private publishers now agree to the principle of serving the people and adopt a responsible attitude towards the people. General publishers can accept mass criticism. When errors are found in publications, they often automatically correct them or automatically stop selling them, and even automatically publish statements in newspapers to correct them, even if they suffer material losses. Newspapers' criticism and introduction of new books have also helped improve the publishing industry. This serious working attitude has become a new trend in the publishing industry. However, on the other hand, the content of publications still seems insufficient, and it cannot closely cooperate with the country's construction work and the actual needs of the people. Writers and compilers have not been well organized and mobilized, resulting in a lack of manuscripts. Some old speculative practices of blind investment still exist, and lack of planning and repeated waste cannot be avoided. In order to correct these shortcomings, it is necessary for publishing to gradually move towards division of labor and specialization in the future.

　　(3) Book supply situation From January to June this year, more than 95 million books were published nationwide, with a total sales price of about 200 billion yuan. The number of books sold has greatly increased compared with before liberation. General books could only sell 1,000 to 2,000 copies a year before the war, but now they can sell 5,000 to 10,000 copies. Popular readings and books for cadres to study can sometimes sell 50,000 to 100,000 copies. This was unimaginable before liberation.

　　However, in terms of the vast territory and large population of our country, the current book supply situation has not yet reached a satisfactory level. The following points are worth noting:

　　First, the people's publications have not really penetrated into the masses of the people. Until now, our readership is still limited to urban petty-bourgeois intellectuals and cadres above the intermediate level. There are too few books suitable for workers, peasants, and soldiers to read. Even if there are some, they have not been universally promoted among them.

　　Second, our bookstores and distribution institutions are still concentrated in big cities and coastal areas, and rarely go to the inland to promote book sales. In Shanghai and Beijing, more than ten bookstores can be found on one street, but in Xinjiang, people have to travel thousands of miles to buy a book. Except for some areas in the old liberated areas, the supply of books in the vast rural areas is completely lacking.

　　Third, books are expensive and people cannot afford them. This has many reasons: paper sources are difficult, manufacturing costs are high, publishing and distribution costs are too high, long-distance transportation costs are high, and the basic pricing system causes confusion in book prices. In addition, the failure to organize the distribution work well is also one of the reasons.

　　Fourth, libraries or mass culture halls have not been universally established across the country, making it impossible for most readers who lack purchasing power to access books.

　　Fifth, the contact between distribution workers and the masses of readers is not enough, and the work of serving readers is not done well enough.

　　These situations must be changed and can be changed. After the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore was changed to an institution specializing in the distribution of books and periodicals, on the one hand, it assumed the task of promoting publications for public and private publishers across the country, and on the other hand, it also assumed the task of supplying spiritual food for readers across the country. Xinhua Bookstore and other public and private distribution workers should unite and plan to sell books and magazines to grassroots readers as much as possible, to factories, rural areas, and troops, and to remote areas, and strengthen contact with readers to launch a large-scale reading campaign.

　　In addition, it is worth noting the current situation of the magazine publishing industry and the printing industry.

　　The publication and distribution of magazines are generally similar to the publication and distribution of books. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently 247 kinds of periodicals across the country, with a total of about 14 million copies printed in the first half of this year and a total sales volume of about 2 million copies per issue. Among them, only two kinds have a sales volume of more than 100,000 copies, four kinds have a sales volume of between 50,000 and 100,000 copies, thirty-seven kinds have a sales volume of between 10,000 and 50,000 copies, and the remaining sales volumes are less than 10,000 copies, and even as low as about 1,000 copies. Here, repetition, waste, lack of characteristics, and lack of planning are the main reasons for the low sales volume. For the magazine publishing industry, it is necessary to promote professional division of labor and combine editorial policies with practice in the future.

　　The difficulties currently encountered by the printing industry are greater than those of publishers and bookstores. Poor business will also affect the decline in technical standards and the low quality of general products. But this is a temporary phenomenon and can be overcome in various ways.

III. New Democratic Publishing Policy and Guidelines

　　The "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" stipulates the general policy and guidelines for the political, military, economic, and cultural construction of the People's Republic of China, which also include publishing policies and guidelines. All of these policies and guidelines should be jointly observed by the people of the People's Republic of China, and should also be jointly observed by our publishing workers. In carrying out administrative or business matters, our publishing workers cannot have other policies, only the general policy stipulated in the "Common Program"; there can be no other guidelines, only the general guideline of new democracy, that is, people's democracy.

　　In order to further understand the general policies and guidelines of new democracy, so as to reduce concerns and avoid biases and errors, it is advisable to make supplementary explanations on the following four issues: (1) Freedom of speech and freedom of the press; (2) The combination of publishing and actual needs; (3) Overall planning and comprehensive consideration; (4) Division of labor and cooperation.

　　(1) Freedom of speech and freedom of the press Except for reactionaries, feudal landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists who are deprived of political rights during the necessary period, the people of the People's Republic of China fully enjoy the right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press. The laws and regulations promulgated by the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past to stifle freedom of speech and freedom of the press have now been abolished. Except for special circumstances during the military control period when it is necessary to deal with counter-revolutionaries, the state does not adopt a manuscript censorship system.

　　However, merely abolishing the negative restrictions on freedom of speech and the press does not mean that the people's rights to freedom of speech and freedom of the press are fully guaranteed. The people's state has the responsibility and obligation to lead and assist people of all classes to engage in speech and publishing undertakings, so that they can develop in a direction that is beneficial to the people and avoid biases and errors. Therefore, the central and local people's governments should be responsible for leading and guiding public and private publishing, printing, and distribution industries, and the publishing, printing, and distribution industries should report their work to the people's governments on time. Under necessary and possible conditions, the people's governments should assist the people in solving the difficulties they encounter in publishing policies and business operations. On the one hand, the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore should undertake the sales tasks of various books and periodicals edited and published by the people across the country. On the other hand, it also has the responsibility to contact the vast readership and reflect their opinions to public and private publishers, so as to gradually improve the content of publications and eliminate the bad tendencies in the publishing industry. Only by actively leading the people to operate and develop legitimate publishing, printing, and distribution undertakings that are beneficial to the people can the people's right to freedom of speech and freedom of the press be substantially guaranteed. It is wrong to interpret freedom of speech and freedom of the press as the state's non-interference in speech and publishing or absolute laissez-faire, which is not in line with the policies and guidelines of new democracy.

　　(2) The combination of publishing and actual needs The "Common Program" stipulates that the culture and education of the People's Republic of China are new democratic, that is, national, scientific, and mass culture and education. There is no doubt that the general guideline of the people's publishing undertaking should also be national, scientific, and mass. But to implement this general guideline, it is necessary to adapt to the times, adapt to local conditions, and combine with the actual needs of the people. Guo Moruo, Director of the Central Cultural and Educational Commission, pointed out in his report at the Second Session of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference that "in the construction of cultural and educational undertakings, we should adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice and combining improvement with popularization." Some of our publishing circles still retain the old style of closing the door to build cars. Currently, our publishing direction is not in line with the needs of the country. Our country is starting to carry out production and construction, but the publishing sector lacks books on finance, economics, science, and technology. On the one hand, our workers, peasants, and cadres complain that there are no books to read, while on the other hand, our publishers are worried that there are no books to publish. Isn't this contradictory? To eliminate this contradiction, we must have a national publishing plan, which must closely cooperate with the country's political, military, economic, and cultural construction plans. In addition, we ask the relevant government departments and various professional people's organizations of the central and local people's governments to be responsible for leading and assisting our public and private publishing industries and to provide necessary instructions on individual editing and publishing plans and the collection and review of manuscripts. We also ask publishing workers to accept the guidance of relevant government agencies and organizations and engage in editing and publishing in accordance with the actual needs of the people at this time and place. Every book and every magazine should make at least a little contribution to the people's spiritual and material life, rather than just publishing for the sake of publishing. This combination of publishing and actual needs is not only beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, but also can indeed solve some difficult problems in business operations.

　　(3) Overall planning and comprehensive consideration There is no doubt that the publication, printing, and distribution of legitimate books and magazines are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. This also includes five kinds of social and economic components, namely, the state-owned economy (state-owned bookstores, publishing houses, and printing factories), the cooperative economy (that is, newspaper and book cooperatives), the individual economy (that is, book stalls and book vendors), the private capitalist economy (privately operated publishing, printing, and distribution enterprises), and the state capitalist economy (publishing, printing, and distribution enterprises jointly operated by state capital and private capital). These five economic components should cooperate in the long term under the leadership of the state-owned economy. There is no doubt that the people's government should also encourage the enthusiasm of private enterprises in their operations and support their development.

　　Currently, private publishing, printing, and distribution industries generally hope to cooperate with state capital to solve the difficulties they encounter in business operations. This is a good phenomenon. However, since the state's financial and economic situation has not yet fundamentally improved and there are still scattered and unreasonable situations in private enterprises, the state should not and cannot provide universal assistance to private enterprises based on a purely relief point of view. In order to facilitate the further implementation of cooperation between state capital and private capital in the future (including various methods such as processing for state-owned enterprises, ordering by state-owned bookstores, and joint public-private operations), private enterprises should first carry out necessary improvements and transformations, improve their own management and operating methods, and achieve self-sufficiency. Some smaller enterprises should carry out joint operations within the scope of possibility in order to facilitate the state's overall planning and comprehensive consideration. It is not possible for private enterprises to solve problems by simply relying on the government or the leadership and assistance of the state-owned economy. It is wrong for state-owned bookstores to adopt a closed-door policy towards private publishing and distribution enterprises, but it is also wrong to adopt a purely relief point of view and an accommodating attitude. Only when both public and private parties consider the overall situation, assume their respective responsibilities, and give play to the initiative, enthusiasm, and creativity of publishing workers can we achieve true overall planning and comprehensive consideration.

　　(4) Division of labor and cooperation "Division of labor and cooperation, each gets what they deserve" is the only effective general guideline and method to overcome the backwardness remaining in China's publishing undertaking, eliminate blindness and anarchy, and improve public-private relations and labor-capital relations. However, the specific implementation of this guideline and method is a long-term and meticulous work. The so-called division of labor and cooperation includes many aspects. First is the division of labor and cooperation between public and private, public and public, and private and private. The second is the division of labor and cooperation in different business scopes. This is professional division of labor, which includes professional division of labor between publishing and distribution, professional division of labor between printing and publishing; and in the publishing industry, there are professional divisions of labor with various different natures and different reader objects, in the distribution industry, there are professional divisions of labor between wholesale and retail, and in the printing industry, there are professional divisions of labor with different technical conditions. Furthermore, there is also the division of labor and cooperation between the central and local governments and the division of labor and cooperation between different regions. The entire production and circulation process of the national economy is inseparable. The professionalization of division of labor in one part will inevitably affect the professionalization of division of labor in other parts. In particular, China's publishing undertaking, due to historical traditions, has always maintained a handicraft style and lacks the habit of division of labor and scientificization. Now, the specific implementation of division of labor and cooperation is a major reform, and it can also be said to be a major revolution. Therefore, the implementation of division of labor should have a focus, a step-by-step approach, and distinguish between urgency and priority. What is particularly important is to take care of the overall situation and not unilaterally consider the problem from the perspective of one's own interests. State-owned publishing, printing, and distribution industries should first implement internal professional division of labor and at the same time delineate a certain scope for private enterprises. For example, the state establishes specialized publishing houses, only focusing on a few of the most important aspects, rather than taking care of everything. State-owned bookstores should mainly undertake wholesale tasks, and should not expand retail branches without limit when it is not necessary, so as not to squeeze out private small and medium-sized booksellers. According to the same principle, state-owned printing factories should not expand machinery and equipment and should stop building large-scale factories when there is overcapacity in the printing industry. As for the professional division of labor of private enterprises, it should advance steadily according to objectively possible conditions. When the general situation of the publishing industry improves, special attention should be paid not to develop in the direction of unlimited free competition. Only in this way can we overcome the blindness and anarchy in publishing enterprises and truly achieve division of labor and cooperation, each gets what they deserve.

IV. How to Overcome Temporary Difficulties?

　　The Chinese people's publishing undertaking is developing, and there are difficulties in the course of development.

　　These difficulties are not essential difficulties, but only the difficulties left over by the unreasonable social and economic system of the past semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, and the difficulties caused by the long-term rule of the Kuomintang reactionary group.

　　Therefore, these difficulties can only be temporary, not long-term. There is a way to overcome these difficulties.

　　What is the way? It is still the eight words mentioned earlier: "overall planning and comprehensive consideration, division of labor and cooperation."

　　First of all, the central and all levels of local people's governments must strengthen their leadership and assistance to the national public and private publishing, printing, and distribution industries. National publishing, printing, and distribution workers must also strengthen unity and maintain close cooperation with the people's government.

　　After the state-owned Xinhua Bookstore was changed to a professional distribution institution, it must assume more leadership and assistance responsibilities to publishers and bookstores across the country. Xinhua Bookstore should assist bookstores and publishers who publish good books and have difficulty operating by means of wholesale, ordering, etc. It should also unite existing public and private bookstores, booksellers, book stalls, and book vendors to organize a universal national book and periodical distribution network. Xinhua Bookstore should treat public and private distribution industries equally in terms of purchasing and delivering goods; preferential treatment should be given to booksellers and book vendors in rural and remote areas.

　　At present, state-owned publishing houses should first implement specialization. At the same time, central and local publishing institutions should also determine the scope of division of labor and cooperation. Public publishing houses, whether central or local, should assume certain leadership and assistance responsibilities for private publishing industries, that is: entrusting processing, exchanging publishing manuscripts with each other, discussing editing and publishing policies and plans with each other, and so on. We welcome private publishing industries to gradually embark on the road of specialization, but it should be based on the strengths and willingness of each publisher. Specialization should not be interpreted as monopolizing a certain profession. Any publisher should be free to choose the books and periodicals they are willing to publish. In order to combine publishing with actual needs, various professional publishing houses can contact relevant government agencies or people's organizations according to the nature and objects of the publications, and accept their leadership to determine editing and publishing policies and assist in supplying and organizing manuscripts.

　　In order to solve the panic of manuscript sources, government agencies and people's organizations should assist the publishing industry to organize and mobilize national writers and compilers, especially should organize worker-peasant-soldier writers and encourage the publication of their works. Publishers of books and magazines should increase the treatment and writing remuneration of writers to the extent possible.

　　In order to improve the quality of publications, it is necessary for publishing institutions to strengthen the personnel and organization of the editorial department.

　　Distribution work and publishing work must be closely linked to readers. The widespread organization of reader clubs and book clubs can not only increase the sales of books and periodicals but also help improve the content of publications. All responsible publishers should attach importance to book reviews in newspapers. Criticism and self-criticism are a force for promoting social progress, and the same is true in the publishing undertaking.

　　In order to increase the sales of books and magazines, it is necessary to gradually lower book prices and reduce the burden on readers. After the division of labor between publishing and distribution and the specialization of publishing, distribution and publishing costs can be reduced, and book prices have the possibility of continuing to decrease. The Publishing Administration is prepared to select excellent books and periodicals published by public and private publishing industries when necessary and possible, and provide appropriate book price subsidies to certain readers. In this way, on the one hand, it helps the sales of books and periodicals, and on the other hand, it also reduces the difficulty for readers to afford books.

　　The basic pricing system causes confusion in book prices. Since prices are now tending to stabilize, we should strive to abolish the basic pricing system in the near future and replace it with a unified currency pricing system.

　　The printing industry is currently in difficulty. But as the number of books and periodicals produced increases next year, most of the difficulties may be overcome. At present, the government and trade unions should first assist in maintaining and selectively provide relief or training to unemployed workers.

　　The biggest difficulty in developing the people's publishing undertaking is the cadre problem. We hope that the publishing industry and the government will cooperate to conduct political education and spare-time training for in-service cadres. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has proposed establishing a national news publishing and printing trade union. State-owned publishing, printing, and distribution industries should first implement a democratic management system to improve labor enthusiasm and increase production efficiency.

　　The Central People's Government is considering strengthening the planning of the work of various departments starting in 1951. We hope that the national public and private publishing, printing, and distribution industries will assist the Central Publishing Administration in drafting and ensuring the implementation of the national publishing plan for next year.

　　论人民出版事业及其发展方向
    出版总署胡愈之署长在第一届全国出版会议上的报告
  一  人民出版事业在革命的战斗中长大
    毛泽东主席说：“中国人从来就是一个伟大的勇敢的勤劳的民族。”
    从出版事业来看也是如此。
    当全世界各国人民还在用泥版、芦草、羊皮之类当作书本的时候，我们的先人已经发明了造纸，已经发明了雕版印刷术。
    世界上第一本用白纸印上黑字的书就是在中国出版的，是我国人民劳动创造的成果。
    勤劳的中国人民不但创造了优良的出版技术，而且用严肃的认真的态度干出版工作。版本的考据，书籍的校勘、编纂和翻译，很早就成为中国所特有的专家事业。我们要感谢前代的出版工作者，他们使我国有悠久历史的文化遗产和丰富的劳动生产经验一大部分得以保存到今天。
    但是在从前，封建地主阶级统治的时代，出版事业的发展究竟是极有限度的。历史上所有反动的统治阶级一贯地采取愚民政策。书籍典册被用来作为“载道”“卫道”的工具。所谓“道”，就是剥削阶级之“道”，封建地主阶级之“道”，和人民大众的利益背道而驰。书本和知识为少数人所独占，出版事业也就没有大量发展的可能。
    鸦片战争以后，中国开始有了石印、铅印、彩印，并且翻译出版了新学书籍。从十九世纪末期开始，中国又有了新式的印书馆、合资经营的书局和期刊杂志。这是从资本主义国家学来的。当时出版的一些新书刊介绍了西方资产阶级的民主思想和科学技术，对初期的民主革命和文化启蒙运动起了推动作用。虽然初期的出版业也沾染了资本主义的病毒，除了极少数优良作品外，大部分书刊只是为了追随市场的需求，迎合小市民的低级趣味，并不适合人民大众的要求，但是出版发行的企业化经营和印刷技术设备的近代化却在这一时期打下了基础。
    至于新的人民出版事业是从五四运动开始萌芽，配合着整个新民主主义革命过程，从战斗中长大起来的。五四以后，中国人民找到了马列主义的普遍真理，走上反帝反封建的解放道路。从《新青年杂志》和《向导周报》开始，进步的书籍刊物成为革命斗争的武器，和人民大众的要求相结合。革命的出版事业在当时力量还很薄弱，并且遭受反动势力的摧残压迫，但是它对于中国人民觉醒所起的巨大影响和作用是难以估量的。
    国民党反动集团二十年的统治扼杀了中国人民的出版自由。在整个国民党统治地区内，美国化的诲淫诲盗的低级读物，歌颂帝国主义、阿谀人民敌人的有毒书刊在市场流行，而为人民所需要的有益读物却遭受到严厉的检查和禁止。进步的书店、报社和杂志社被查封没收，人民的作家、人民的出版工作者遭受惨杀、拘禁和迫害，无法计算数目。
    但是，反动统治阶级无论怎样残暴凶恶，到底不能阻止新的人民出版事业的成长和发展。一方面，进步的作家们和出版家们，在国民党统治区内，拿笔杆当作枪杆，拿纸弹当作枪弹，用公开的和秘密的方式，和帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义作长期的坚决的斗争，在文化出版领域中，建立起不可摧毁的人民革命的营垒。这方面留下了两个伟大的名字—鲁迅和邹韬奋。
    另一方面，革命作家和革命出版工作者，从土地革命时期起，就在革命根据地建立起革命的出版事业的基础，在极端紧张的战争情况下，大量出版书刊，对于马列主义、毛泽东思想的传播和工农兵的文化政治教育做了出色的工作。毛泽东的旗帜成为革命出版工作者的旗帜。从抗日战争到解放战争，文化出版事业在国民党区日见衰落，在解放区不断发展。在物质条件十分缺乏的困难环境中，新华书店大批供应了优良的丰富的人民精神食粮，在大部分的解放区农村和解放军部队中，展开了革命书刊的发行工作，获得了广大群众的欢迎。
    在这里必须提及的是友邦苏联对于我国人民出版事业的大力援助。莫斯科外文出版局出版了中文本的马列主义经典著作，使我国人民的政治思想教育和一般干部理论水准的提高收到了极大的效果。
    不可否认，三十年来革命的人民出版工作，在中国共产党的领导、号召、影响之下，对于广大的中国人民的觉醒、团结、进步和统一，曾经起了巨大的作用，它成为伟大的人民解放事业中一个不可缺少的部分。
    人民觉醒了，人民团结起来了，人民胜利了。全中国大部分地区的解放，国民党反动统治的覆亡，人民政协的召开，中华人民共和国和中央人民政府的成立，整个国家的完全统一，货币物价的稳定，财政经济状况的开始好转，农村中以消灭封建剥削为目的的土地改革的稳步前进，城市中工商业的逐渐恢复和发展，所有这些创造了中国一切人民事业发展的有利条件和无限前途，也创造了中国人民出版事业发展的有利条件和无限前途。虽然出版工作目前还存在着一些困难，有待于克服，可是新民主主义的人民出版事业的稳固基础已经建立起来了。这个基础是不可摧毁的，前途是光辉灿烂的。饮水思源，我们不能不向中国人民出版事业的先驱者，无数牺牲者和战士，表示崇高的敬意。这是无可置疑的，他们的英勇的斗争和勤劳的工作曾经是中国人民解放事业胜利成功的重要因素之一。
  二  全国大城市解放后的出版事业概况
    一九四九年人民解放战争在全国范围内取得胜利以后，出版事业出现了全新的面貌。国民党的反动思想堡垒，如正中书局、独立出版社、中国文化服务社等被人民接收。反动刊物停止出版。国营新华书店开始以城市为中心，大量出版进步的书刊。工人和青年分别建立了他们自己的出版社。其他私人资本经营的书店自动肃清了在解放前印行的一部分反动书籍。封建迷信的、低级趣味的、于人民有害的书刊逐渐从市场上被驱逐。各种革命的、科学的优良读物在全国各地大量行销。出版事业现在不再成为反动统治阶级用以欺骗和麻醉人民的工具，而成为新中国人民精神生活中重要的战斗武器了。
    新生的力量是活泼健全的，是有发展前途的。但是它还年青，还没有壮大，还有许多困难和缺点需要克服。
    从中华人民共和国诞生以后，全国书刊的出版印刷发行工作情况可以分作以下的几点来说明：
    （一）书籍的生产数量据不完全的统计，从一九五○年一月到六月，全国出版书籍（不包括期刊），计初版新书二六一九种，重版书四二五七种，总印数为九五、二二四、五一六册。其中包含中小学教科书五七、六三三、一八六册。除去教科书不算，一般书籍的平均印数为六四一八册。
    从这些数字来看，一九五○年上半年书籍出版总数量虽然比解放前有了增加，可是还没有恢复到抗战前的水准。
    据本年六月底的调查，全国公私营出版机关共计四二六家，但在今年上半年，只有一八五家出版新书。其他二四一家，生产是在停顿或半停顿中。
    全国专印书刊的印刷厂，估计有百分之五十的生产力在目前是过剩的。这也说明了目前书刊的生产数量还没有恢复到抗战前的水准。
    如果下半年出版数量和上半年相差不多，则一九五○年全年全国出版的书籍杂志应为二万万册，平均起来，全国每二人或三人才有一册，比之于苏联今年度的出版计划，全国出版总数为八万万册，还不包含期刊在内，平均每一人得到新书四册，差得多了。要是再拿每册书的容量多少和用纸数量来比较，我们目前的出版生产量大约和苏联相差十倍。
    （二）出版方向  出版总署成立以后，向全国出版家征集中华人民共和国开国以后初版和重版新书的样本，到七月底为止，收到的样书总计为四九六○种，其中由公营、公私合营书店及机关团体出版的计二○八八种，由私营书店出版的计二八七二种。
    就出版物的内容来区别，所占百分比如下：
          类别                      百分比
          政治理论及时事            二○·七
          哲学、语文、史地          一一·六
          自然科学及应用技术        一七·一
          文艺                      一八·九
          学校课本                  六·五
          通俗读物                  一八·一
          儿童读物                  五·三
          其他                      一·八
    全国现在出版新书的一八五家出版业（除新华书店外，公营一五家，公私合营六家，私营一六三家）中，出版文艺书籍的有九四家，其中三九家出版在五种以上；出版社会科学书籍的有八五家，其中二八家出版在五种以上；出版自然科学及应用技术书籍的三九家，其中一六家出版在五种以上；出版通俗读物的有八八家，其中三二家出版在五种以上。以上的统计是极不完全的。但是大体上可以看出出版的方向主要是出文艺书，其次是通俗读物和社会科学书籍。出版自然科学和应用技术书籍的不到出版家总数的十分之一。
    在七月底为止收到的九二八种的文艺书中，文学理论占百分之七，文学创作占百分之三六，翻译作品占百分之三五，戏剧音乐美术占百分之二二。在文学创作中，新的作品不到一百种，大部分是旧的创作的重印本。翻译主要是苏联的作品，数量相当多，是这一时期出版的特点。
    社会科学书籍销行册数一般都比文艺书籍多。这是十分自然的。由于汹涌全国的学习运动的高潮，一般干部和新解放区的读者，对于政治理论书的要求要比对于文艺读物的需要迫切得多。包含十二种马列主义经典著作的《干部必读》已经全部出齐，印行的总数达三百万册。《毛泽东选集》的新版，由于校订和注释工作的浩繁，直到现在还不能全部付印。全国读者渴望已久了。在不久的将来，这一部巨著的出版将是中国出版界划时代的一件大事情。
    除了这些以外，属于社会科学和政治时事这一类的书籍，大部分是有关政策法令的小册子和活叶本。大部头的专门著作或译作并不多。政治时事读物在今年出版的，比去年的版本较为统一整齐，排印校对上的错误已经大大减少。但是这类书籍大部分是编选政策文件报告论文而成，内容往往互相重复。在目前的情势下，这是无法避免的。
    出版界对工农兵通俗读物和儿童读物的重视，还不过是正在开端，但已经收获了相当大的效果。北京和上海方面，公私出版家大量地编印了通俗故事、曲本、唱本、连环画和其他通俗读物，在市场上逐渐挤掉了旧的有毒素的通俗读物。所欠缺的是内容方面狭，偏重文艺性，介绍科技史地财经常识的太少。这一工作继续干下去，是有极大前途的。
    自然科学和应用技术书籍的出版，还没有引起一般出版界的注意，在目前新出版的自然科学书籍中，只有少数的译本和一些中级读物。关于财经和应用社会科学的书籍也出得很少。
    解放以后，各种工具图书如字典、辞书、地图等，需要十分迫切。许多旧的出版物必须重加订正。有些出版家为了迎合市场的需求，把旧的版本改头换面，草率印行，引起了读者普遍的不满和批评。出版家要是用严肃的、认真的态度，修订旧的，重编新的工具书，对于我们的读者是有极大帮助的。
    学校教科书的出版，在解放以后，情形相当混乱，各地所用版本不一律，供应不及时。今年秋季，中央教育部和出版总署作出了决定，把小学用书及中学语文史地课本首先统一规定版本，并抑低书价。在最近的将来，在中央教育部和出版总署领导之下，将建立人民教育出版社，逐渐统一全国教科书的编辑出版工作。但由于目前学制和课程标准还没有确定，在若干时期内，教科书的全国统一编印和统一采用，还不可能办到。因此，在目前，私人出版家编印教科书，由教育部审核后发售，是被许可的。
    从一般来说，解放以后出版情况是完全不同了。公私出版业者现在都同意为人民服务的原则，采取对人民负责的态度。一般出版家都能接受群众的批评，发现了出版物有错误，往往自动改正或自动停售，甚至自动登报声明更正，虽因此遭受物质损失，亦无所顾惜。报纸对新书的批评介绍，也帮助了出版事业的改进。这种认真的工作态度已成为出版界的一种新风气，但是另一方面，出版物内容还显得不够充实，和国家的建设工作、人民的实际需要还不能密切配合。作家和编译工作者还没有很好地组织和动员起来，因而造成稿源的缺乏。某些盲目性的投机的旧作风有时还存在着，缺少计划性，重复浪费无法避免。为了纠正这些缺点，今后出版逐渐走向分工和专业化是有必要的。
    （三）书籍供应的情况  今年一月至六月，全国出版书籍九千五百余万册，总售价约为二千亿元。书籍销数比解放前已大大增加。一般书籍在战前每年只能销一二千册，现在可以销五千至一万册。通俗读物和干部学习用书有时可以销到五万至十万册。这是解放以前所不能想像的。
    但是就我国领土的广大和人口的众多来说，目前书籍供应的情况还没有达到使人满意的程度。值得我们注意的有以下几点：
    第一、人民的出版物并没有真正深入到人民大众中间。直到目前为止，我们的读者群还只是局限于城市小资产阶级知识分子和中级以上干部，适合工人、农民和战斗员阅读的书本子是太少了，即使有了一些，也没有普遍地在他们中间推销。
    第二、我们的书店和发行机构依然集中在大城市和沿海一带，很少到内地去干书籍的推销工作。在上海和北京，一条街上可以找到十余家书铺，但在新疆，人们要赶几千里路才能买到一本书。除老解放区一部分地区以外，在广大的农村中，书籍的供应是完全缺乏的。
    第三、书价贵，买不起书。这有多方面的原因：纸张来源困难，造货成本高，出版和发行费用太大，远处运费贵，基本定价制度造成书价的混乱。此外，发行工作没有很好的组织起来也是其中原因之一。
    第四、全国还没有普遍建立图书馆或大众文化馆，使大多数缺乏购买力的读者无法和书本子接近。
    第五、发行工作者和读者群众的联系不够，替读者服务的工作做得不够。
    这些情况是必须改变而且有可能改变的。国营新华书店改为专营书刊发行的机关之后，一方面对全国公私出版家担负起出版物的推销任务，另一方面也对全国读者担负起精神食粮的供应任务。新华书店和其他公私发行工作者应当联合起来，有计划地把书籍杂志尽量推销到基层的读者群，推销到工厂农村部队里去，推销到偏远地区，并且要加强和读者的联系，大规模展开读书运动。
    除此以外，值得提起注意的，是杂志出版业和印刷业的目前情况。
    杂志出版和发行的情况，一般都和书籍出版和发行的情况相类似。据不完全的统计，全国现有期刊杂志二四七种，今年上半年总印数为一千四百万册左右，每期总销数为二百万份左右，其中销数达十万份以上的只有二种，十万份以下五万份以上的四种，五万份以下一万份以上的三十七种，其余销数都不到一万份，甚至有少至一千份左右的。在这里，重复浪费，缺少特性，缺少计划性是销数不多的主要原因。对于杂志出版业，今后提倡专业分工并使编辑方针与实际结合，是有必要的。
    印刷业目前遭遇的困难要比出版家和书店的困难来得大。营业不振，也会影响到技术水准的下降和一般生产品质的低落。但这是一时的现象，是可以从各方面设法克服的。
  三  新民主主义的出版政策和方针
    《人民政协共同纲领》规定了中华人民共和国政治、军事、经济、文化建设的总政策和总方针，其中也包含了出版政策和方针。这全部的政策方针是中华人民共和国人民所应当共同遵守的，也是我们出版工作者所应当共同遵守的。我们出版工作者，在执行行政或业务中，不可能有别的政策，只能有一个《共同纲领》所规定的总政策；不可能有别的方针，只能有一个新民主主义的即人民民主主义的总方针。
    为了更深入了解新民主主义的总政策和总方针，以求减少顾虑，并避免发生偏向和错误，不妨就以下四项问题作补充说明：（一）言论自由和出版自由问题；（二）出版和实际需要相结合的问题；（三）统筹兼顾问题；（四）分工合作问题。
    （一）言论自由和出版自由问题  除反动分子、封建地主、官僚资本家在必要时期内被剥夺政治权利外，中华人民共和国的人民充分享有言论自由权和出版自由权。国民党反动政府过去所颁布的箝制言论与出版自由的法令，现在已经废除。除了军管时期对付反革命分子的特殊情形有必要者外，国家不采取原稿检查制度。
    但是，仅仅取消了对言论出版自由的消极限制，并不就等于充分保障了人民的言论出版自由权利。人民的国家有责任和义务领导并协助各阶级人民，从事言论和出版事业，使之向有利于人民的方向发展，避免发生偏向和错误。由于此，中央和地方人民政府对于公私出版印刷发行业应当负领导和指导的责任，出版印刷发行业应向人民政府按时报告工作情况。人民政府在必要与可能的条件下，应协助人民解决在出版方针和业务经营上所遭遇的困难。国营新华书店一方面应当担负全国人民所编辑出版的各种书刊的销售任务，另一方面也有责任联系广大的读者群，把他们的意见反映给公私出版家，以逐步改进出版物内容，消灭出版界的不良倾向。只有积极领导人民经营和发展正当的有益于人民的出版印刷发行事业，才能使人民大众的言论自由权和出版自由权有了实质上的保障。把言论出版自由解释为国家对言论出版的不干涉主义或绝对放任主义，是错误的，是和新民主主义的政策方针不相符合的。
    （二）出版与实际需要结合的问题  《共同纲领》规定，中华人民共和国的文化教育为新民主主义的，即民族的、科学的、大众的文化教育。毫无疑问，人民出版事业的总方针也应当是民族的、科学的、大众的。但是要实施这一总的方针，必须因时制宜，因地制宜，和人民的实际需要相结合。中央文化教育委员会郭沫若主任在人民政协全国委员会第二次会议的报告中，指示了“在文教事业建设中应坚持理论与实际相结合，提高与普及相结合的方针”。我们的一部分出版界，目前还残存着闭门造车的旧作风。目前我们的出版方向，和国家的需要是并不相符合的。我们的国家正在开始进行生产建设，而出版方面就缺少关于财经科技的书籍。一方面，我们的工人、农民和干部同志埋怨没有书本子可读，而另一方面，我们的出版家却在愁无书可出。这不是很矛盾吗？要消灭这一矛盾，我们就要有一个全国性的出版计划，这个计划要和国家的政治、军事、经济、文化建设计划密切配合。此外，我们要求中央和地方人民政府各专业部门和各种专业的人民团体负责领导和协助我们的公私出版业，就各别的编辑出版计划，稿件的征集审核，予以必要的指示。我们也要求出版工作者接受有关政府机关团体的指导，按照此时此地人民的实际需要，从事编辑与出版。每一本书，每一册杂志，都要对于人民的精神物质生活，至少有一点一滴的贡献，而不只是为出版而出版。这样使出版和实际需要结合起来，不但有利于国计民生，而且在业务经营上，也确实可以解决一些困难问题。
    （三）统筹兼顾问题  正当的书籍杂志的出版印刷发行，毫无疑义，是有利于国计民生的事业。在这里面，也包含了五种社会经济成分，即国营经济（国营的书店、出版社和印刷厂），合作社经济（即书报合作社），个体经济（即书摊、书贩），私人资本主义经济（私人经营的出版印刷发行企业）和国家资本主义经济（国家资本与私人资本合作的出版印刷发行企业）。这五种经济成分应当在国营经济领导之下长期分工合作。人民政府对于私营事业并应鼓励其经营的积极性，扶助其发展，也是无可怀疑的。
    目前私营出版印刷发行业一般都希望和国家资本合作，以解决其在业务经营上所遭遇的困难。这是一种好现象。但是由于目前国家财政经济状况还没有基本好转，私营企业中也还存在着散漫的不合理的情形，国家不应当亦不可能根据单纯的救济观点，对私营企业加以普遍的资助。为了便于日后更进一步实行国家资本与私人资本的合作（其中包含国营企业加工，国营书店定货，公私合资经营等各种方式），私营企业应首先进行必要的改进和改造，改善本身的管理与经营方式，达到自给自足的程度。某些规模较小的企业，在可能范围内，实行联合经营，以便于国家的统筹兼顾。私营企业单纯倚赖政府或倚赖国营经济的领导和协助是不能解决问题的。国营书店对私营出版发行企业采取关门主义是错误的，但是采取单纯的救济观点和迁就主义也是错误的。只有公私双方从全局着想，分别负责，发挥出版工作者的主动性、积极性、创造性，才能做到真正的统筹兼顾。
    （四）分工合作问题  “分工合作，各得其所”，这是克服中国出版事业中所残存的落后性，消灭盲目性和无政府状态，改善公私关系和劳资关系的唯一有效的总方针和总办法，这个方针和办法的具体执行却是一件长期的细致的工作。所谓分工合作，包含了很多方面。首先是公营和私营、公营和公营、私营和私营的分工合作。其次是不同的经营范围的分工合作。这就是专业分工，其中包含了出版和发行的专业分工，印刷和出版的专业分工；而在出版业中又有各种不同性质和不同读者对象的专业分工，在发行业中有批发和零售的专业分工，在印刷业中有不同的技术条件的专业分工。再其次，还有中央与地方的分工合作和不同地区的分工合作。国家经济的整个生产流通过程是不可分割的。一部分的分工专业化一定会影响到其他部分的分工专业化。特别是中国出版事业，由于历史的传统，一向保持手工业作风，缺乏分工和科学化的习惯，现在要具体实施分工合作，是一次大改革，也可以说是一次大革命。因此，实施分工应当有重点，有步骤，分别出缓急先后，特别重要的是要照顾全局，而不可单从本位利益出发，片面地考虑问题。国营出版印刷发行业首先要实行内部的专业分工，同时给私营企业划出一定的范围。例如国家建立专业出版社，只抓住几个最重要的方面来进行，而不是一切都包办。国营书店应当以担负批发任务为主，在没有必要时，不应无限制发展门市分支店，以免把私营中小书商挤垮。根据同一原则，国营印刷工厂在印刷业生产过剩时，也不应扩充机器设备，并应停止大规模建厂。至于私营企业的专业分工，应当根据客观可能的条件稳步前进。到了出版事业一般情况好转的时候，特别要注意不要向无限制的自由竞争的方向去发展。只有这样，我们才有办法克服出版企业中的盲目性和无政府状态，才能真正做到分工合作，各得其所。
  四  怎样克服暂时的困难？
    中国人民出版事业是在发展的，在发展的途程中是有困难的。
    这困难不是本质上的困难，只是过去半封建半殖民地的不合理的社会经济制度所残留的困难，也是国民党反动集团长期统治所造成的困难。
    所以这困难只能是暂时的，不可能是长期的。这困难是有办法克服的。
    什么办法呢？还是前面说过的八个字：“统筹兼顾，分工合作。”
    首先，中央和各级地方人民政府必须加强对全国公私出版印刷发行事业的领导和协助。全国出版印刷发行工作者也要加强团结，和人民政府保持密切的合作。
    国营新华书店改为专业的发行机构之后，要对全国出版家和书店负起更多的领导和协助的责任。新华书店应当用总批发、定货等方式，对于出版良好读物而经营困难的书店和出版家加以协助。它也应当联合现有公私书店、书商、书摊、书贩，组织普遍全国的书刊发行网。新华书店对公私发行业进货发货应同等待遇；对于农村中和偏远地区的书商书贩尤应予以优惠待遇。
    在目前，国营的出版社首先实行专业化。同时中央和地方的出版机关也要确定分工合作的范围。公营的出版社，不论是中央的或地方的，对于私营出版业都应当担负一定的领导和协助的责任，这就是说：委托加工，相互交换出版稿件，相互商讨编辑出版方针及计划等等。我们欢迎私营出版业逐步走上专业化的道路，但要根据各出版家的特长和自愿。专业化亦不应解释为对于某一专业的独占。任何出版家选定他自己所愿意的书刊出版应当是有自由的。为了使出版结合实际需要，各种专业出版社可按出版物性质对象，和有关政府机关或人民团体分别联系，并接受其领导，以确定编辑出版方针，并协助供给组织稿件。
    为了解决稿源的恐慌，政府机关和人民团体应当协助出版界，把全国著作家和编译工作者组织并动员起来，特别应当组织工农兵作家，鼓励他们的作品的出版。书籍和杂志的出版家应当在可能范围内提高作家的待遇和写稿的报酬。
    为了提高出版物的质量，出版机关加强编审部的人员和组织是有必要的。
    发行工作和出版工作都必须密切联系读者。读者俱乐部和读书会的广泛组织，不但可以增加书刊的推销，而且对于出版物内容的改进是有帮助的。一切负责的出版者都应当重视报纸的书评。批评和自我批评是推动社会进步的一种力量，在出版事业中也是一样。
    为了使书籍杂志的销路增多，必须逐步降低书价，减轻读者的负担。出版发行分工与出版专业化之后，发行与出版费用可以减省，书价有继续降低的可能。出版总署准备于有必要与可能时，选择公私营出版业出版的优良书刊，对某些读者予以适当的书价补贴，这样，一方面帮助了书刊的推销，另一方面也减少了读者买不起书的困难。
    基本定价制度造成书价的混乱。在目前物价已趋稳定，应当争取于不久将来取消基本定价制，改用统一的货币定价制。
    印刷业在目前是有困难的。但是在明年书刊生产数量增加，困难可能大部分克服。在目前政府和工会应首先协助维持，并有重点地救济或训练失业工人。
    发展人民出版事业，目前最大的难关是干部问题。我们希望出版界和政府合作，进行在职干部的政治教育与业余训练。全国总工会已经提议建立全国性的新闻出版印刷工会。国营出版印刷发行业应首先实行民主管理制，以提高劳动积极性，增加生产的效率。
    中央人民政府正在考虑从一九五一年开始各部门工作加强计划化。我们希望全国公私出版印刷发行业协助中央出版总署起草并保证执行明年度的全国出版计划。经初步研究，一九五一年度，为准备扫除文盲，推广干部文化教育，出版书刊应以工、农、兵、青年、妇女通俗读物为重点。此外并应增加政治建设、生产建设所需要的出版物，同时改进学校教科书、工农课本的出版发行工作。出版总署并拟建立民族语文出版社，以使国内各民族都能用他们自己的语文大量出版书籍。此外，对海外的书刊供应亦在计划中。预计明年书籍刊物出版数量可比今年增加一倍，目前出版事业中的困难可以解决一大部分。在今后三四年内，相信出版事业可以获得基本的好转。
    中国人民是伟大的，勇敢的，勤劳的。在新民主主义革命的长期斗争中，中国人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导之下，克服了无数困难，终于获得胜利。目前人民出版事业在发展途程中所遭遇的困难比较起来是微不足道的，而前途却无限光明。全中国的著作家、艺术家、出版家、编译、审订、校对、排版、制图、印刷、装帧、发行工作同志们和广大读者们，团结起来，站在共同的新民主主义的文化战线上，统筹兼顾，分工合作，克服暂时的困难，稳步前进吧！我们要争取在最短时期内实现毛泽东主席的科学预言：
    “我们将以一个具有高度文化的民族出现于世界。”
          （完）
