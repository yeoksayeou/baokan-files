　　Autumn harvesting is underway across the country. This autumn, about 60 million mu of crops nationwide have suffered from disasters such as floods, hail, and pests, resulting in varying degrees of reduced harvests. However, the vast majority of the remaining areas are experiencing bumper harvests. The general autumn harvest is estimated to be at least 80%. In North China, the main autumn crops are estimated to yield about 80% of a normal year, while the Northeast may reach 85%. In the provinces of East China and Central South China, early and mid-season rice has already been harvested, with yields around 80-90%. Cotton growth has been very good in all areas, and picking has begun, with a bumper harvest also expected. In some areas, the harvest situation is unprecedented in the last decade. This year's autumn crop harvest is another significant victory on the agricultural production front, following the bumper wheat harvest this summer. The original plan for increasing grain production in 1950 was 10 billion jin, but judging from the current situation, it will increase at least twice as much. Cotton production will also exceed this year's production plan. This victory has already begun to show a significant impact on the preliminary improvement of farmers' lives and the recovery of urban industry and commerce. The fact that industry and commerce in cities across the country have begun to be active is a good proof. There is no doubt that in China, where agriculture still accounts for an absolute advantage in the economy, the bumper harvest has extremely important significance. Therefore, in this autumn, the basic task of rural work is to ensure this year's bumper harvest, and at the same time strive for greater production increase next year. As Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi said on May Day this year, once land reform is completed, and there are two or three decent years of bumper harvests, the shrinking purchasing power in rural areas will rapidly recover and gradually expand, thus making urban industry and commerce prosperous.

　　This year's bumper harvest is not a natural occurrence, but the result of tremendous subjective efforts. The reasons for this year's autumn harvest, in terms of objective factors, are: First, the weather has been favorable across the country this year, and no widespread serious disasters have occurred; Second, the national war has basically ended, and the heavy war service has been lifted in most areas. On the subjective side, the Central People's Government has formulated correct policies, and the local people's governments have also done very arduous work: First, in the old liberated areas, the policy of developing production has been implemented, the ideology of agricultural socialism has been repeatedly criticized, the importance of leading production has been emphasized, and much work has been done to organize and improve technology. In the relatively stable new areas, a rent reduction policy and a policy of "whoever plants, harvests" has been implemented. In areas disrupted by bandits, large-scale bandit suppression work has been carried out to stabilize social order. These policies have encouraged the production enthusiasm of farmers in various regions. In disaster areas, the People's Government has implemented a policy of self-salvation through production, vigorously carried out disaster relief work, used work-for-relief, rushed to plant late autumn crops, and developed sideline production, and stabilized the disaster victims, etc., to stop the expansion of the disaster. At the same time, the People's Government has carried out large-scale water conservancy construction nationwide. This year, except for the Huai River in northern Anhui, which was in danger, the country has basically been free from floods. For agricultural production, the People's Government has issued a large number of agricultural loans, led farmers to improve farming, apply more fertilizer, and diligently eliminate pests and diseases. In order to take care of the interests of farmers, the state trade organs have adopted appropriate purchase policies and appropriate price policies for agricultural products and agricultural and sideline products. In the new area's agricultural tax policy, a policy of appropriately reducing the burden and rewarding production on the basis of a reasonable burden has also been implemented. These measures are important reasons for encouraging the enthusiasm of farmers and creating this year's autumn harvest.

　　In order to ensure this autumn's harvest, and to make autumn plowing and autumn sowing well, so as to strive for greater production increase next year, it is still necessary to do a lot of arduous work. The idea that agricultural production does not need leadership, especially that the bumper harvest does not need leadership, is wrong. So, what should be done to lead this year's autumn production work? We should establish a good production order, implement production policies, not violate agricultural time, and improve agricultural production technology.

　　Rural production order is the political basis for carrying out rural production. At present, the autumn harvest order in various places is generally good. But to complete the autumn harvest, and to smoothly carry out autumn plowing and autumn sowing, a lot of work still needs to be done. In the old liberated areas, the foundation of production order is better, but we should also be vigilant against the sabotage of bad elements. In the vast new areas, especially in some areas in the southwest and southeast coastal areas, the remaining bandits have yet to be wiped out, and we should be very vigilant against bandits and special agents destroying the autumn rural production order. We should step up the suppression of bandits and implement armed protection of the autumn harvest. In areas where land reform is about to be carried out, we should strictly prevent landlords from destroying production. Although the number of disaster areas in the country this year is not very large, the lives of disaster victims are still quite difficult. During the autumn harvest, we must strictly prevent theft or robbery, so as not to cause disorder in the rural order in the disaster areas. Disaster relief work should be carried out according to normal plans. No matter in the new or old areas, we should oppose the waste phenomena such as big eating and drinking caused by the bumper harvest. Waste will be the root of chaos. We should educate farmers with the idea of ​​expanding reproduction and long-term famine preparedness.

　　To be able to guide farmers across the country to actively carry out autumn production, we must implement the various policies of the Communist Party of China and the Central People's Government on agricultural production. Only by correctly implementing the agricultural production policy can we break the various ideological concerns of the masses in production work and inspire vigorous production enthusiasm. According to the current ideological status of the masses and the actual situation in various places, we should focus on publicizing and implementing the following three aspects of policies in different regions: (1) Land reform is of course the most basic policy to encourage farmers to produce. However, in areas where land reform is decided to be implemented this winter and next spring, autumn production must still be carried out earnestly before the land is distributed and land rights are determined. Here, it is necessary to resolutely implement the "whoever plants, harvests, whoever bears" policy stipulated by the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government in accordance with the original land use rights, in order to "protect labor income" and encourage autumn plowing and autumn sowing, so as to avoid wasting land this autumn. If farmers have carried out autumn plowing and autumn sowing on the land they have leased, and are drawn out and distributed to other farmers during land reform, the crops on this land should be harvested by the original planting farmers, and the burden should be paid by the original planting households. Even if the land was originally plowed and sown by the landlord, and later distributed to the farmers, and the farmers did not invest in processing, the crops should be harvested by the original planting landlord when they are harvested next year, and the burden should be paid by the landlord. If the land-divided households have invested in processing this crop, they should consult with the original growers to divide the crop proportionally and pay the burden fairly. In areas where rent reduction is implemented this winter and next spring, it should be ensured that rent is reduced in accordance with the law and that the legal income of the landlord after rent reduction is guaranteed. All new areas should deeply publicize the policy of "preserving the rich peasant economy" to relieve the new rich peasants and other farmers of various concerns about production, so as to carry out autumn plowing and autumn sowing with confidence. (2) In areas where land reform has been completed, it is necessary to resolutely continue to implement the People's Government's policy of protecting the people's private property and rewarding production, and resolutely stop any illegal acts that violate the policy and infringe on the people's property rights and land rights. Violators should be punished by law. Phenomena such as the arbitrary use of livestock, large carts, or other farm implements by farmers without the real consent of the original owner, without payment, or failure to compensate for damage, must be corrected, because this is an act that destroys private property and undermines the production enthusiasm of farmers. (3) Implement an appropriate price policy for purchasing agricultural products. After the autumn harvest, farmers will inevitably have a large number of grains and cotton on the market to exchange for the means of production and means of living they need. State trade organs should purchase agricultural products and promote industrial products at fair and reasonable prices that can stimulate reproduction. Especially for industrial raw materials, such as cotton, hemp, and tobacco leaves, it is necessary to ensure the established parity, properly purchase, and strive to simplify the procedures. The success or failure of the implementation of this price policy is not only related to the farmers' living problems this year, but also has a significant impact on the production of industrial raw materials and special crops in the next two or three years, which also affects the industrial production problems.

　　Agricultural time is of great importance to agricultural production. This year's autumn production work should strive to be timely and should have a preliminary plan. In the autumn harvest work, we should advocate harvesting, plowing, and sowing as we go. Timely harvesting of grains can avoid losses due to over-ripening. But harvesting too early will also reduce the harvest. Timely autumn plowing can increase soil fertility, and timely sowing can increase yield. Agricultural production must tightly grasp seasonality and must not violate agricultural time. In the past, the old liberated areas were basically in a war environment, and agricultural production could not be fully timely and planned. This year, this situation should be changed. In areas suitable for cotton planting, when sowing wheat, sufficient cotton fields should be reserved. Next year's national cotton planting plan should be expanded compared to this year, and various places should prepare in advance according to specific circumstances. This year, some places have destroyed green seedlings and replanted cotton due to insufficient planning in advance, and this must be avoided next year. All rural labor force should be organized and mobilized in appropriate ways and invested in production. Only by organizing and mobilizing rural human resources in appropriate ways can we ensure the timely completion of the tense autumn production tasks.

　　Leading and helping farmers improve farming techniques is one of the main keys to increasing agricultural production in areas where land reform has been completed. However, improving agricultural science and technology is an extremely heavy task. According to the current agricultural production situation and scientific and technological conditions in China, it is not possible to make a comprehensive improvement. In this year's autumn production, we should focus on promoting and popularizing three technical improvements that are indeed feasible and have universal significance: seed selection, seed soaking, and deep plowing. In terms of seed selection, we must extensively carry out the mass movement of field seed selection that has been partially implemented in various places. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has proposed a plan to popularize improved seeds within five years, and should carry out extensive publicity and explanation work among the masses, specifically introduce field seed selection methods, mobilize the masses to evaluate good seeds compared to crops, and enlighten the masses on the recognition of adopting improved seeds and improving technology. Agricultural leading organs at all levels should organize the regulation of improved seeds in order to eliminate more and larger quantities of miscellaneous and inferior seeds and switch to planting improved seeds with high yields, good quality, and strong growth capacity next year. For high-quality cotton seeds, separate harvesting and separate ginning should be implemented. In autumn planting, the treatment of wheat seeds should generally promote the methods of seed selection, seed soaking, and medicine seed mixing to strictly prevent the occurrence of nematode disease and black smut disease of wheat next year. The key to the promotion of seed selection and seed soaking methods lies in the specific organization of the masses to implement them. Autumn plowing should strive for deep plowing. In recent years, due to insufficient animal power and the impact of war, the arable land has generally been extensive, resulting in an increase in pests and a decline in soil fertility. This year, the results of some state-owned farms promoting deep plowing show that weeds have been reduced and crops have grown vigorously, proving that deep plowing is one of the important conditions for increasing agricultural production, and it is simple and easy to implement. This is an old experience in Chinese agricultural production, and all regions should pay attention to its promotion. In addition, in areas with particularly good production foundations, technical improvement work such as the appropriate promotion of new agricultural tools can also be carried out. In short, to improve agricultural technology, it must be in line with the actual local conditions, and it must be proven to be feasible through experiments before it can be promoted and popularized, so as to avoid causing losses and hindering the development of technical improvement work.

　　If all the above points are earnestly done, then this year's bumper autumn harvest will be guaranteed, and important conditions will be prepared for striving for greater production increase next year. This year, grain can already be self-sufficient, and cotton production is not far from meeting the needs of the existing textile scale. With another one or two years of bumper harvests, major agricultural products such as grain and cotton will have surpluses. Then, the era of exchanging surplus agricultural products for industrial machinery to build the country will gradually come. The future is limitless, and all rural workers and all farmers should work hard.

　　保证今年秋季丰收  争取明年更多增产
    全国各地正在进行秋收工作。今年秋季全国除约有六千万亩的农作物，遭受水、雹、病虫害等灾害，因而有程度不同的歉收外，其余绝大部分都是丰收。秋收一般在八成或八成以上。华北主要秋季作物的收成，估计约有八成年景，东北可达八成半。华东及中南各省，今年早稻中稻已经收割，产量均在八九成左右。各地棉花生长情况均甚良好，已经开始摘花，丰收亦无问题。有些地区，丰收情况为十年来所未有。今年秋季农作物的丰收，是继今夏小麦丰收之后，在农业生产战线上的又一重大胜利。一九五○年粮食增产，原计划增产一百亿斤，以现在情形看，至少增加一倍以上。棉花亦超过今年生产计划。这个胜利对于农民生活的初步改善与城市工商业的恢复，已开始表现出重大的影响。全国各城市的工商业均已开始活跃，就是很好的证明。毫无疑问，在农业经济比重还占绝对优势的中国，丰收有极端重要的意义。因此，在今年秋季，农村工作的基本任务在于保证今年的丰收，同时争取明年更大的增产。刘少奇副主席今年五一节时说过，只待土地改革完成，又有两三个像样的丰收年成，农村中萎缩的购买力，就将迅速恢复，并逐步扩大，因而使城市工商业繁荣起来。
    今年的丰收局面不是自然而来的，是经过主观上巨大努力得来的。今年秋季丰收的原因，客观方面是：一、今年全国各地风调雨顺，未发生普遍性的严重灾害；二、全国战争已经基本结束，繁重的战争勤务在绝大部分地区已经解除。在主观方面，则是中央人民政府制定了正确的政策、各地方人民政府也作了很艰巨的工作：首先在老区，贯彻了发展生产的政策，反复批评了农业社会主义的思想，强调了领导生产的重要性，对于组织起来与提高技术，作了许多工作。在比较安定的新区，实行了减租政策，与谁种谁收的政策。在土匪扰乱的地区，则进行了巨大规模的剿匪工作，安定了社会秩序。这些政策在各种不同地区都鼓舞了农民的生产情绪。在灾区，人民政府执行了生产自救的政策，大力进行了救灾工作，用以工代赈，抢种晚秋，发展副业生产，安定灾民等方法，停止了灾情的扩大。同时，人民政府在全国范围内，进行大规模的水利建设，今年除皖北地区的淮河出险外，全国各地基本上免除了水灾。对于农业生产，人民政府发放了大量农业贷款，领导农民进行改良耕作，多施肥料，勤除病虫害等灾害。为了照顾农民利益，国家贸易机关对于农业品和农副业产品，采取了适当的收购政策和适当的价格政策。在新区的农业税政策上又实行了在合理负担的基础上，适当减轻负担，奖励生产的政策。这些措施，都是鼓舞农民生产热情，造成今年秋季丰收的重要原因。
    为了保证今秋丰收，并且使秋耕秋种作得好，以争取明年更大的增产，还必须作许多艰巨的工作。农业生产不需要领导，特别是丰收不需要领导的观念是错误的。那么，领导今年秋季生产工作，应当作些什么呢？应当确立良好的生产秩序，贯彻生产政策，不违农时，与改良农业生产技术。
    农村生产秩序，是进行农村生产的政治基础。现在，各地秋收秩序，一般尚好。但要完成秋收，而且要顺利进行秋耕秋种，还须作很多工作。在老区，生产秩序的基础较好，但亦应警惕不良分子的破坏。在广大新区，特别是在西南以及东南沿海某些地区，残余土匪，尚待肃清，应十分警惕土匪特务破坏秋季农村生产秩序。应加紧剿灭土匪，实行武装护秋。即将进行土地改革的地区，应严防地主破坏生产。今年全国灾区虽为数不太大，但灾民生活尚相当困难，在秋收时更要严防偷窃或抢劫等现象，以免造成灾区农村秩序的紊乱，救灾工作应按正常计划进行。无论新老区均应反对因丰收而来的大吃大喝等浪费现象，浪费将是混乱的根源。应当用扩大再生产与长期备荒的思想，教育农民。
    要能引导全国农民积极进行秋季生产，必须贯彻中国共产党与中央人民政府有关农业生产的各项政策。只有正确执行农业生产的政策，才能打破群众在生产工作上存在的各种思想顾虑，鼓舞起旺盛的生产热情。根据目前各地群众思想状况及实际情况，在不同地区，应有不同重点地宣传与贯彻以下三个方面的政策：（一）土地改革当然是鼓励农民生产的最基本的政策。但在今冬明春决定实行土地改革的地区，在土地尚未分配、地权尚未确定之前，仍须认真地进行秋季生产。这里就必须依照原来土地使用权状况，坚决执行中央人民政府政务院所规定的“谁种谁收谁负担”，以“保护劳动所得”的政策，鼓励秋耕秋种，以免今秋荒废土地。农民在其承租的土地上已进行秋耕秋种，而在土地改革时被抽出分配予其他农民时，此种土地上的农作物应由原下种的农民收获，并由原种户缴纳负担。即使原由地主秋耕秋种的土地，以后分配给了农民，农民又未加工投资者，这种农作物在明年收获时应由原下种的地主收获，并由地主缴纳负担。若分地户对此种农作物曾有加工投资者，则应按比例和原耕种者协商分收，并分别公平缴纳负担。在今冬明春实行减租的地区，应保证依法减租和在依法减租后地主的合法所得。所有新区，都应深入宣传“保存富农经济”的政策，以解除新区富农及其他农民群众对生产的各种顾虑，以便放心进行秋耕秋种。（二）在已经完成土地改革的地区，必须坚决继续贯彻人民政府关于保护人民私有财产和奖励生产的政策，对于任何破坏政策、侵犯人民财权地权的违法行为，必须坚决制止。犯法者应受法律的处分。农民之间，不经原主真正同意，而任意使用牲口、大车或其他农具，不出代价，或使用坏了不予赔偿等现象，必须纠正，因为这是破坏私有财产、打击农民生产情绪的行为。（三）贯彻收购农产品的适当的价格政策。秋收后农民必然有大批粮棉上市，以换回其所需要生产资料与生活资料，国家贸易机关应以公平合理的能够刺激再生产的价格收购农产品、推销工业品。尤其是对于工业原料，如棉花、麻、烟叶等项，更须保证既定的比价，妥加收购，手续要力求简便。这一价格政策执行的好坏，不仅关系到农民今年的生活问题，而且重大地影响到今后两三年内工业原料与特种作物的生产，也就是影响有关工业生产的问题。
    农时对于农业生产有极大的重要性。今年秋季生产工作要争取及时而且应有初步的计划。秋收工作中，应提倡随收、随耕、随种。谷物收割及时，可以避免因过熟而来的损失。但过早收割，亦将减少收成。及时秋耕可以增加地力，及时播种能够提高产量。农业生产必须紧紧地掌握季节性，不能违背农时。过去，老解放区基本上处于战争环境中，农业生产不能完全适时而有计划，今年应当改变这种情况。宜于植棉的地区，播种小麦时，应留足够的棉田，明年全国的植棉计划，要比今年扩大，各地应根据具体情况预为准备。今年某些地方因事先计划不周，有毁掉青苗再种棉花的现象，明年必须加以避免。一切农村劳动力，均应在适当方式下，组织起来和动员起来，投入生产。只有把农村人力按照适当方法组织与动员起来之后，才有可能保证及时地完成紧张的秋季生产任务。
    领导和帮助农民改进耕作技术，是已经完成了土地改革的地区农业增产上的主要关键之一。但改进农业科学技术是一项极繁重的工作，按照中国目前农业生产情况及科学技术等条件，还不可能作全盘的改进。在今年秋季生产中，应该有重点地提倡推广选种、浸种、深耕等三项确实可行而有普遍意义的技术改进。在选种方面，要广泛开展各地已经部分实行的田间选种的群众性运动。中央人民政府农业部曾提出五年内普及优良种子的计划，应在群众中进行广泛的宣传解释工作，具体介绍田间选种办法，动员群众比庄稼评良种，启发群众对于采用良种，改进技术的认识。各级农业领导机关应组织良种调剂，以期明年更大量的淘汰杂种劣种，改种产量高、品质好、生长能力强的优良种子。对于优良棉种，应实行分收分轧。秋种中对于麦种的处理，要普遍提倡选种、浸种及药拌种的方法，严防明年麦子发生线虫病、黑穗病等。选种和浸种方法的推广，关键在于具体组织群众实行。秋耕应力求深耕。近年来因为畜力不足和战争的影响，耕地一般粗放，以致虫害增多，地力下降。今年有些国营农场推行深耕的结果，杂草减少，庄稼生长旺盛，证明深耕为农业增产的重要条件之一，且简便易行，这本是中国农业生产上的老经验，各地应注意推广。此外，在生产基础特别好的地区，还可以适当的推广新式农具等技术改进工作。总之，改进农业技术，必须切合当地实际情况，经过实验确实可行，才能予以提倡推广，以免造成损失，并阻碍技术改进工作的开展。
    上述各点，如果都认真作到，那么，今年秋季大丰收就有了保证，并且为争取明年更大的增产准备了重要条件。今年粮食已可以自给，棉花产量和现有的纺织规模的需要已相去不远。再有一两年丰收，粮食棉花等主要农产物均将有剩余。那末，以剩余农产品换工业机器以建设国家的时代就会逐步到来了。前途无量，一切农村工作人员与全部农民均应当努力。
