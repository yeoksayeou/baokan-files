　　National State-Owned Petroleum Industry
    Exceeds Semiannual Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 29th] The national state-owned petroleum industry has exceeded its semiannual plan in terms of the output of major products, capital construction, and prospecting; quality has also improved.
    In the first half of this year, the gasoline output of the Yumen Oil Mine accounted for 53% of the annual plan, equivalent to 127.1% of the first half of last year; the kerosene output accounted for 68.6% of the annual plan, equivalent to 140% of the first half of last year. The gasoline output of the Yanchang Oil Mine accounted for 87.9% of the annual plan, and the kerosene output accounted for 105.6% of the annual plan. The gasoline output of the Fushun Oil Refinery accounted for 53.7% of the annual plan, and the diesel output accounted for 56% of the annual plan. The output of major products from other factories and mines has also been overfulfilled.
    As a key point of capital construction, the new well project of the Yumen Oil Mine has completed 60% of the annual plan. The ten major restoration projects of the Fushun Oil Refinery for this year have been completed by 60% to 70%. Under the direct or indirect guidance of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government, prospecting work in various places is being carried out in a focused manner according to the predetermined plan, and its progress has mostly exceeded the quota.
    In the first half of the year, all factories and mines have achieved success in dewaxing, degumming, and desulfurizing products to improve quality. The Fushun Oil Refinery has made great efforts to improve the quality of gasoline and diesel; now the factory has begun to produce various lubricating oils, and the transformer oil produced can withstand 30,000 volts of high-voltage electricity.
