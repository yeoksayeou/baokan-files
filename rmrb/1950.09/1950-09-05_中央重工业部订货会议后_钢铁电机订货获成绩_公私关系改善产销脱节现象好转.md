　　Central Heavy Industry Ministry Ordering Conference Yields Results
    Achievements in Steel and Electrical Machinery Orders
    Improved Public-Private Relations and Better Production-Sales Alignment
    [Our Dispatch] The Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry held two national ordering conferences in the first half of this year. It systematically organized nationwide steel and electrical machinery orders, strongly supported the recovery and development of private enterprises, and gradually improved the long-standing phenomenon of production-sales misalignment. All twenty-eight private steel rolling mills and seventy-eight private electrical machinery factories in Shanghai were operating because of direct or indirect order acceptance. The Industrial Department of the East China Military and Political Committee also assisted large and small factories to organize, cooperate, and share responsibilities in technology and equipment. This solved the difficulty that most private electrical machinery factories could not independently manufacture large motors and enabled some factories without the capacity to accept tasks to participate in manufacturing parts, thus increasing order volume. In the process of processing, some private manufacturers have gradually realized that the only way out is to unite around state-owned and joint state-private enterprises, reorganize unreasonable structures, improve management methods, increase production, and reduce costs. For example, the capitalist of Shanghai Zhonghua Steel Factory invested 70 million yuan in April of this year to improve the medium-sized steel rolling mill equipment, doubling production. In early July, the capitalist of the factory invested over 100 million yuan again to renovate the large-scale steel rolling mill and added continuous steel baking furnaces. In the past, Anquan, Huataixing, Xinyuan, and other electrical machinery factories could only manufacture small motors of 10 horsepower or less. After the support of this ordering method, they improved their equipment and are now able to manufacture 100-horsepower motors. Some electrical machinery manufacturing factories have increased their production capacity from originally producing 200-horsepower motors to producing 500-horsepower motors. The private Washeng Electric Appliance Factory has also changed its business policy from mainly producing daily necessities such as electric fans to mainly producing motors.
    Since the beginning of the ordering work, the cost of various products has been continuously reduced. The selling price of steel in North China has been reduced by 19 percent, pig iron by 18.1 percent, electric motors by 9 percent, and transformers by 10 percent. The price of steel in East China has also been reduced by 17 percent. This is the result of clarifying and fixing the types and specifications of raw materials in a certain period, reducing waste.
    However, there are still some shortcomings in the ordering work. Due to insufficient understanding of the situation by various units, they were hesitant about the number of orders during the contract signing process and could not provide specific specifications or physical samples, delaying time and affecting production. After the order was placed, the order numbers were often changed, breaking the original allocation plan. Some even returned goods midway, causing product backlogs. Or because the product quality failed to fully meet the contract requirements, disputes arose. In addition, for some orders, due to lack of manufacturing experience, it was impossible to predetermine the price. Although the price was agreed upon by both parties, the actual cost was still too high, causing mistrust between the user departments and the manufacturing departments. Some of these shortcomings have been overcome, and some should be paid attention to and corrected in the next ordering. After the order was placed, abnormal price differences between market prices and factory prices also occurred. Taking the North China region as an example: the market price of steel rose by 19 percent from February to July, and some varieties rose by as much as 65 percent; while the factory price of state-owned enterprises decreased by 14 to 19 percent during this period, and some varieties decreased by as much as 32 percent. In order to correct this abnormal price difference and ensure the normal supply of steel, the Central Finance and Economics Committee has instructed the Ministry of Trade to order steel from the Ministry of Heavy Industry for unified market supply. The two ministries are currently discussing this. (Reported by the Ministry of Heavy Industry Reporting Group)

### 中央重工业部订货会议后  钢铁电机订货获成绩  公私关系改善产销脱节现象好转

　　中央重工业部订货会议后
    钢铁电机订货获成绩     
    公私关系改善产销脱节现象好转
    【本报讯】中央人民政府重工业部于今年上半年召开过两次全国性的订货会议，有系统的组织了全国钢铁、电机订货，有力地扶植了私营企业的恢复和发展，并使多年来的产销脱节现象，逐步好转。上海全市二十八家私营轧钢厂、七十八家私营电机厂因直接或间接接受订货而全部开工。华东军政委员会工业部并协助大小型工厂组织起来，在技术上和设备上互相分工配合，解决了大多数私营电机工厂不能单独制造大型马达的困难，并使若干没有接受任务能力的工厂，也可以参加制造零件，订货量因而增加。在加工过程中，有的私营厂商已逐渐明确只有团结在国公营企业的周围，改组不合理的机构，改善经营方法，提高生产、降低成本，才是唯一的出路。如上海中华制铁厂资方于本年四月间首先投资七千万元，改善了中型轧钢机设备，产量增加一倍，七月初该厂资方再次投资一亿余元，整修大型轧钢机，添置了连续式的烘钢炉。安全、华泰兴、新元等电机厂过去只能制造十匹以下小型马达，经过此次订货方式的扶助，改进了设备，已能制造一百匹马力的马达。有的电机制造厂则由原来只能生产二百匹马力马达的生产能力，提高到生产五百匹马力的马达。私营华生电器厂，亦已转变经营方针，由过去生产电风扇等日用品为主，改变为以生产电机为主。
    从订货工作开始迄今，各种产品成本不断降低。华北钢材售价已降低百分之十九，生铁降低百分之十八点一，电动机降低百分之九，变压器降低百分之十；华东钢材亦降低百分之十七，这是由于生产品的种类、规格、在一定时期中均明确固定，减少浪费的结果。
    但是订货工作中还存在着若干缺点。由于各单位对情况了解不够，在订合同过程中，对订货数量犹豫不决，且不能提出具体规格或实样，拖延时间影响生产。订货后又常常变动订货数字，打破原订分配计划，有的甚至中途退货，造成产品积压，或因产品质量未能全部符合合同规定，引起争议。另有若干订货，因无制造经验，无法预定货价，虽经双方商定价格，但实际成本仍嫌过高，造成使用部门与制造部门之间的互不信任。这些缺点有的已经克服，有的应引起注意，在下次订货时加以纠正。订货后，也曾发生市价与厂价的反常差额现象，以华北区为例：二至七月份钢材市价上涨百分之十九，个别品种有涨达百分之六十五者；而国营企业的厂价在此期间却降低百分之十四至十九，个别品种有降低百分之三十二者。为纠正此种反常差额，保证钢材正常供应，中央财委会已指示贸易部，向重工业部订购钢材，统一供应市场。现两部正商讨中。（重工业部报道组）
