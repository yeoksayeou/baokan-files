　　Truman Orders Implementation of Economic Controls
    Publicly Declares Intention to More Cruelly Exploit the Sweat and Blood of Workers and Peasants
    [Xinhua News Agency, September 12th] Truman signed the Economic Control Act passed by the U.S. Congress on September 1st, on September 8th, and delivered a radio address on the evening of the 9th to defend the act, which is part of an overall plan to expand war preparations. According to the U.S. News Service, the U.S. government and bipartisan members of Congress, taking advantage of the opportunity of launching the Korean War, quickly proposed and passed this act called the "Defense Production Act of 1950," granting Truman dictatorial powers to manipulate the entire national economy in order to accelerate the economic mobilization for war. According to this act, the President has wartime privileges such as prioritizing the requisition of various resources for war production, freezing wages, and controlling consumption and prices. Truman ordered the establishment of a special agency on the 9th to be responsible for planning and implementing specific control measures.

    Truman's radio address on the evening of the 9th once again expressed the intention of the U.S. government to push the American people into larger-scale war preparations through the Korean War. Truman bluntly admitted that the U.S. government is planning to continue to greatly expand armaments on the basis of this year's already unprecedentedly large "peace" time war budget. He explained that in the next fiscal year, the U.S. war expenditure will be "much more" than the current 30 billion U.S. dollars, and that huge military expenditures will continue in the "coming years." Truman recklessly demanded "absolute guarantees... for the production of guns, cannons, airplanes, tanks and other supplies."

    In his lengthy radio address, Truman demanded that every worker, farmer and others must "work harder and work longer hours," and said that "everyone's taxes will be increased." Although large monopoly capital has already obtained and will obtain huge profits from government military orders, Truman called the proposed 5 billion U.S. dollar tax increase on the working people "fair sharing." Truman also wants people to tighten their belts. Truman admitted that war production will increase the workload, but will not allow workers to demand wage increases as a result.

    Truman's speech is further evidence that the American warmongering clique is tightening the noose around the necks of the American people step by step with the fabricated so-called "danger facing the free world."

### 杜鲁门下令实施经济管制  公然宣称要更惨酷地压榨工农血汗

　　杜鲁门下令实施经济管制
    公然宣称要更惨酷地压榨工农血汗
    【新华社十二日讯】杜鲁门已于九月八日签署美国国会前在九月一日通过的经济管制法案，并于九日晚发表广播演说，为这一作为扩大战争准备之总计划的一部分的法案进行辩解。据美国新闻处消息，美国政府和国会两党议员借发动侵略朝鲜战争的机会，迅速提出通过的这个名为“一九五○年国防生产法”的法案，授予杜鲁门以操纵全部国民经济的独裁大权，以加速进行战争的经济动员。按照这个法案，总统有优先征发各种资源用于战争生产、冻结工资、管制消费和价格等战争时期的特权。杜鲁门已于九日下令成立特别机构，负责计划与执行各项具体管制事宜。
    杜鲁门于九日晚发表的广播演说，再次表示了美国政府借朝鲜战事把美国人民推入更大规模的战争准备中的意图。杜鲁门直认不讳，美国政府正打算在本年度已经空前庞大的“和平”时期战争预算的基础上，继续大大扩大军备。他说明到下一会计年度，美国的战争费用将比目前的三百亿美元还要“多得多”，并且要在“今后若干年”中继续巨大的军事开支。杜鲁门肆无忌惮地要求“绝对保证……生产枪、炮、飞机、坦克和其他各项供应品”。
    杜鲁门在其冗长广播演说中要每一个工人、农民及其他人等必须“更加刻苦工作并加长工作时间”，并说“每个人的纳税将要加重”。尽管大垄断资本已经从并将更多地从政府的军事定货中获得巨额利润，杜鲁门却把已提出了的五十亿美元的嫁在劳动人民头上的增税叫做“公平分摊”。杜鲁门还要人民束紧裤带。杜鲁门承认战争生产将加重工作分量，但却不许工人因此提出增加工资要求。
    杜鲁门的演说是又一证据，它再度证明美国战贩集团正以虚构的所谓“自由世界面临的危险”，一步紧一步地来勒住套在美国人民头颈上的绳索。
