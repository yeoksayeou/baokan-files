　　Mao Zedong Locomotive

  Thirty-seven, "I request to join the Party!"
    "Continue with Representative Song's affairs." Someone urged again.
    "It would be a long story, let me put it simply." Guo Shude couldn't stop and continued: "In short, Representative Song was too good. If I have any credit on the Zhu De locomotive, it's mainly because of Representative Song's good leadership, all thanks to his help. Without him, what would I know? What could I do?"
    "Representative Song is indeed good." Lao Shang interjected, "I don't usually praise people, but I must say Representative Song is good. Whenever you look for him, he always smiles first. He never gets angry at anyone's problems, and always persuades people with reason. Old Hero, tell me, if there hadn't been Representative Song's leadership at the beginning of the Mao Zedong locomotive, would we be where we are today? The day he was transferred, I was eating, and he made a special trip to the large canteen and said to me softly: Comrade Lao Shang, work hard and don't have accidents. Although the words were very ordinary, they really moved me at the time. Everyone knows that my temper, Shang Baoheng's temper, is quite awkward, right? But I must say that Representative Song is qualified as a Communist Party member!"
    "Big Driver Shang's words are completely accurate," said the Old Hero, "Representative Song often taught me to unite, only by uniting everyone can we do things well. But at that time, I was not open-minded. Representative Song's help to me was truly great."
    "But do you know what Representative Song himself said?" Guo Shude continued, "He said, what ability does he have? It's all thanks to the Party's leadership. Without the Party's leadership, what would he know? What could he do? Nothing can be done without the Communist Party. During the Spring Festival of the year of liberation, Representative Song and many cadres personally visited my home to offer New Year greetings. My father was over sixty years old, and I saw him treat my father like his own father. Life was hard at that time, we ate sorghum porridge, but he didn't mind at all, he sat down and ate. While eating, he tried to comfort my father as much as possible. I had never seen such a thing, such a superior, in my life. At that time, I was so happy that I really wanted to cry. I couldn't wait to say to him, Representative Song, what do you want me to do? If you want me to die, I will die immediately!..." He lowered his voice a little, and continued:
    "Later, at the Hero Conference, Commander Lü and us ate together, giving us full glasses of wine. Commander Lü was a leading comrade of the Northeast Railway Bureau at that time. ...Later, at the Sixth National Labor Congress, hearing about the arduous struggle, bloodshed, and sacrifice of the worker brothers in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled areas, I thought, we are now serving the people, at most we shed some sweat, which is nothing compared to them. Speaking of since the Mao Zedong locomotive was established, if it hadn't been for the leadership and help of Representative Zhang and others, I wouldn't be able to do anything well. I turn to them whenever I encounter difficulties, don't think that I, Guo Shude, have much ability. Therefore, I still believe in Representative Song's words: nothing can be done without the Communist Party! If everyone wants to ask me how to progress, how to work, I only have one sentence: rely on the Communist Party!"
    People seemed to be stunned. Guo Shude wiped his sweat with a towel and was still very excited.
    Wang Qingquan broke the tense scene and said:
    "Everyone, if you have any opinions, continue to talk."
    People breathed a sigh of relief. After a while, the Old Hero said with great effort:
    "There is nothing to talk about anymore, everything is clear. ...I request to join the Party!"
    "Great!" Wang Qingquan jumped up and said.
    "But this is my boldness, I know I am not qualified enough. There are many things that are embarrassing to talk about: when the Duan Branch was made public, the branch secretary notified me to participate and asked me to prepare a speech, but I didn't make it in time to participate. When the Yimianpo publicly formed the Party, I participated. When the cadres and Party members reviewed their shortcomings, it was truly touching. But I always take one step, stop one step, and think one step at a time. It wasn't until today that I brought it up, which is already a big step late."
    Then Hu Chundong and Xiao Zhu also requested to join the Party.
    Lao Shang kept his head very low. Lao Zheng's face was flushed, and his heart was pounding like a small drum. He mustered up the courage several times to make a request, but he dismissed the courage several times himself: considering that he was not qualified enough, and he had too many shortcomings in the past...
    Finally, Guo Shude expressed his warm welcome to the three comrades' requests to join the Party and explained that he would immediately report to the branch and have it approved by the general branch after review.
    After the meeting, he and Wang Qingquan, Yue Shangwu, and others separately found Lao Shang and Lao Zheng to comfort and encourage them. (Attached picture)

　　毛泽东号

  三十七、“我请求入党！”
    “接着讲宋代表的事情。”有人又催促了。
    “讲起来话长，我简单说吧。”郭树德也收不住，又讲下去了：“总之，宋代表是太好了，我在朱德号要说有什么功劳，主要是宋代表领导得好，全仗他的帮助。要没有他，咱懂个什么？能干个什么？”
    “宋代表确实是好。”老商插嘴说：“我不说别人好，不能不说宋代表好。一找他总是先笑，谁有了问题，从来不发脾气，拿道理说服人。老英雄你说，毛泽东号一开头要是没有宋代表领导，哪会有今天？他调动工作的那天，我正在吃饭，他还特地跑到大食堂，轻声地跟我说：老商同志，好好干，别出事故。话虽极平常，但当时真使我感动极了。大家知道，我商宝恒脾气够别扭的吧？可是我就说宋代表够个共产党员的资格！”
    “商大车的话半句不差，”老英雄说：“宋代表常教我要团结，只有团结起大家才能把事情办好。可是那时候我脑筋不开，人家宋代表对我的帮助可真不小。”
    “可是你们知道宋代表自己怎么说？”郭树德又接着说：“他说他自己有什么能耐？全仗党的领导。要没有党的领导，他懂个什么？能干个什么？离开了共产党是什么也干不好的。就在解放那年过年的时候，宋代表和许多干部亲自到我家去拜年。我父亲六十多了，我看他对我父亲就像对他自己的父亲一样。那时候生活苦，吃的是高粱米粥，他一点也不嫌，坐下来就吃。一面吃一面还尽量安慰我父亲。我长到这么大，从没有见过这样的事情，这样的上级。当时我高兴得真想哭，我恨不得对他说，宋代表，你要我干什么吧？你要我死，我马上就死去！……”他讲到这里，把声音放低一些，又说下去：
    “后来在英雄会上吕司令员和我们一同吃饭，给我们满酒。吕司令员那时候是东北铁路局的领导同志。……再后来，在全国第六次劳动大会上，听到蒋管区工人兄弟艰苦奋斗、流血牺牲的情形，我就想，咱们现在为人民服务，顶多多流些汗罢了，比起人家都算不上是个什么。就说到了毛泽东号以来，要是没有张代表他们的领导和帮助，我也是什么也干不好的。我一遇上困难就找他们，别以为我郭树德有多大能耐。因此至今我信服了宋代表的话：离开了共产党是什么也不行的！大家要问我怎样进步，怎样工作，我只有一句话：依靠共产党！”
    人们好像都呆住了，郭树德拿手巾擦着汗，还很兴奋。
    王清权打破了这个紧张场面，说道：
    “大家还有什么意见，继续谈吧。”
    人们这才松过一口气来。又过了一阵，老英雄很吃力地说：
    “没有什么谈的了，种种一切都明白了。……我请求入党！”
    “好啊！”王清权跳起来说。
    “不过这是我的大胆，我知道自己还不够条件。有许多事情说起来难为情：段支部公开的时候，支部书记通知我，叫我参加，还叫我准备讲话，我没有赶上参加。一面坡公开党的时候，我参加了，干部和党员检讨自己缺点的时候，真叫人感动。可是我总是走一步停一步想一步的，直到今天才提出来，已经大大的晚了一步。”
    接着胡春东和小朱也提出请求入党。
    老商把头埋得很低。老郑满脸通红，心里像敲小鼓，他几次鼓足勇气也想提出请求，几次自己又把这勇气打消了：考虑到自己还不够条件，过去自己的缺点太多……
    最后郭树德表示热烈欢迎三个同志的入党请求，并说明他马上汇报支部，经过总支审查批准。
    散会以后，他又和王清权、岳尚武等分别找老商、老郑，安慰并鼓励他们一番。（附图片）
