　　The Supreme Glory of the Chinese Working Class!
    Labor Model Representatives Elected in Lüda and Other Places.
    Representatives are Taking the Lead in Launching Production Competitions to Greet National Day and Defend Peace.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 2nd] The election of national labor model representatives of workers, peasants and soldiers is being carried out enthusiastically throughout the country. As of now, the industrial labor model representatives have been elected in the provinces and cities of Chahar, Shandong, Dalian, Fushun, Benxi, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Handan, Wuhan, Chongqing, Kunming, etc., with a total of forty representatives elected. Agricultural labor model representatives have been elected in Chahar, Shandong, Beijing, Xi'an and other provinces and cities, totaling fourteen people. Exhibits for the industrial and agricultural product exhibition to be held simultaneously with the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers are also being prepared in various places. The above-mentioned exhibits from Tangshan City have been sent to the conference preparation office.
    [Comprehensive report from this newspaper] Since the National First Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers was scheduled to be held in Beijing on September 25, various places have launched intense and prudent work to elect model workers. As far as we know now, the officially elected industrial labor model representatives include:
    Lüda: Zhao Guilan, Wang Zhaoda, Liu Maoyou;
    Anshan: Yang Mingyuan, Guo Yingchen, Meng Tai, Zhang Wenhan, Sun Zhaosen;
    Benxi: Jia Dingxun, Qu Fuming, Wang Fengxiang;
    Taiyuan: Wang Guiying, Wang Kaishan, Bai Qingshan, Li Jing, Zhang Xiuzhen, Zhou Chongren;
    Chahar Province: Ma Wanshui, Ma Liuhaizi, Mu Weifan, Ren Qingshan, Zhang Li;
    Suiyuan: Shen Wenhan;
    Wuhan: He Shigu, Liu Qiyu, Zhu Jiu, Li Dexing;
    Jinan: Liu Qingxiang, Luo Shufang;
    Qingdao: Zhang Zuoliang, Zhang Shude;
    Xuzhou: Wang Jingquan;
    Zibo Mining Area: Jin Yusheng;
    Shandong Provincial Transportation System: Zhao Chunqi.
    Representatives from other places are also being enthusiastically evaluated and selected.
    All localities attach great importance to this election of labor models. Therefore, they can be serious and responsible in the election, and the elected representatives are warmly supported by all employees. For example, when the Shanghai State-owned Cotton Textile Factory No. 19 elected its representatives, the groups first produced candidates, the workshops conducted preliminary evaluations to review whether the model facts were true and solicited the opinions of all workers. Then, the factory's evaluation committee conducted a review and regarded them as candidates for the entire factory. After a democratic election by the entire factory, they participated in the Shanghai municipal election of representatives. The Lüda Federation of Trade Unions determined nine candidates based on the materials provided by each factory, printed the model deeds of the candidates into pamphlets, distributed them to the workers of each factory for extensive discussion, and then democratically elected three people from the nine candidates. Therefore, in the process of the election, the model deeds of the labor models have inspired the enthusiasm of the majority of employees. Many units have combined the evaluation of models with the production movement to promote production work. For example, the Nanjing seamen who are rushing to repair the Pukou wharf project proposed to complete the task successfully and then conduct the evaluation, closely linking the election of models with the completion of production tasks. Due to extensive and in-depth mobilization and careful and meticulous work, many hardworking activists who usually buried their heads in hard work were discovered in this evaluation. For example, Xia A'di, an old female worker in Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3, usually produced the most bobbins (seven and a half) and the least waste silk. People in the reeling room praised her bobbins as easy to use, but the trade union had never praised her before. This time, she was unanimously rated as a model by everyone.
    However, some factories did not conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and education among the masses before selecting models, so that everyone could closely combine the selection of models with production to promote production, and the masses did not generally realize that the elected models were their own role models. Therefore, after the election in some units, it was "all is well," and it did not have any impact on the majority of workers. In individual units, even biases occurred during the election. For example, among the three representatives elected by the Wusong Machinery Factory, although the number of votes was very concentrated, there was not a single industrial worker who directly engaged in production.
    The happiest thing for the labor model representatives elected from various places is to be able to come to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao. Zhang Zuoliang, a representative from Qingdao, said at the meeting: "I thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for giving us the glory." Zhao Guilan, a representative from Lüda and a good daughter of the Party, even said, "I want to learn more knowledge of production and construction at the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers and bring it back to overcome the shortcomings in our production." The representatives generally stated: determined to take the lead with practical actions, launch a production competition, greet the first National Day anniversary, oppose American aggression and defend world peace.

　　中国劳动人民的无上光荣！
    旅大等地选出工业劳模代表
    代表们正带头开展生产竞赛迎接国庆保卫和平
    【新华社二日讯】全国工农兵劳动模范代表的选举，正在全国各地热烈进行。截至目前止，已完成工业劳动模范代表选举的有察哈尔、山东、大连、抚顺、本溪、唐山、秦皇岛、邯郸、武汉、重庆、昆明等省、市，共选出代表四十人。农业劳动模范代表已在察哈尔、山东、北京、西安等省市选出，共十四人。与全国工农兵劳动模范代表会议同时举行的工农业产品展览会的展览品，各地亦正在筹集中。唐山市的上述展览品已送达大会筹备处。
    【本报综合消息】全国第一次工农兵劳动模范代表会议定于九月二十五日在北京召开以来，各地即展开紧张而慎重的选举模范工作。就现在所知，正式选出的工业劳动模范代表计有：
    旅大：赵桂兰、王兆达、刘茂有；
    鞍山：杨明远、郭英忱、孟泰、张文翰、孙照森；
    本溪：贾鼎勋、曲福明、王凤翔；
    太原：王贵英、王凯山、白青山、李井、张秀珍、周崇仁；
    察哈尔省：马万水、马六孩、穆维藩、任庆山、张立；
    绥远：沈文翰；
    武汉：贺世古、刘启宇、朱玖、李德兴；
    济南：刘庆祥、骆淑芳；
    青岛：张作良、张淑德；
    徐州：王景全；
    淄博矿区：金玉声；
    山东省运输系统：赵春起。
    其余各地代表亦正热烈评选中。
    各地对此次劳模选举极为重视，因此在选举中能认真负责，选出的代表受到全体职工热烈拥护。如上海国营棉纺织厂十九厂选举该厂代表时，先由小组产生候选人，车间进行初评，审查模范事实是否确实，并征求全体工人意见，然后交全厂的评选委员会进行复查后，作为全厂候选人，经过全厂民主选举，参加上海市竞选的代表。旅大总工会则根据各厂提供的材料，确定九名候选人，把候选人的模范事迹印成小册子，发给各厂工人进行广泛讨论，然后从九名候选人中，民主选出三人。因此在选举的过程中，劳模们的模范事迹已经启发了广大职工的积极性。不少单位更把评模和生产运动结合起来，推进生产工作。如正在抢修浦口码头工程的南京海员们提出胜利完成任务进行评选，把选举模范同完成生产任务紧紧的连结在一起。好多地区由于动员广泛深入，工作慎重细致，在此次评选中发现不少平时埋头苦干的积极分子。如上海国棉三厂一个老女工夏阿弟平常做筒子出数最多（七只半），回丝最少，摇纱间的人都称赞他的筒子好用，可是工会平时未曾表扬过她，这次被大家一致评为模范。
    但是也有的厂子在选模前没有广泛深入的宣传教育群众，使大家把选模和生产密切结合，以促进生产，没有使群众普遍认识到被选出的模范就是自己的榜样，因此，有的单位选举过后，也就“万事大吉”，对广大工人并没发生任何影响，个别单位甚至选举中发生了偏向。如吴淞机器厂选出的三个代表，票数虽很集中，却没有一个直接生产的产业工人。
    各地被选出的劳动模范代表，最高兴的一件事，就是能到北京来见毛主席。青岛代表张作良在大会上说：“我感谢毛主席、共产党给我们的光荣。”旅大代表、党的好女儿赵桂兰更表示“要在全国工农兵劳模会议上，学得更多的生产建设的知识带回来，以克服我们生产中的缺点。”代表们普遍表示：决心带头以实际行动，展开生产竞赛，迎接第一个国庆纪念日，反对美国侵略保卫世界和平。
