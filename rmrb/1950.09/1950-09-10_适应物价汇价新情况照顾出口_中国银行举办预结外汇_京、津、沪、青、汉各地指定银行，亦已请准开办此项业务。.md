　　Adapting to New Price and Exchange Rate Situations to Support Exports
    Bank of China Introduces Forward Exchange Settlement
    Designated banks in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Wuhan have also been approved to offer this service.
    [This Newspaper Reports] To adapt to the new situations in prices and exchange rates, Bank of China branches in various locations have successively introduced forward exchange settlement. Since the unification of national financial and economic work, the exchange rate has been gradually lowered from April. Especially since the American imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea in late June, domestic prices in the United States have risen and the currency has depreciated. Although the Bank of China has lowered the US dollar exchange rate several times in July and August, the extent of the decline is still far from keeping up with the rate of dollar depreciation. This has made it difficult for general exporters to calculate costs, and they are inevitably worried about export business. In response to this situation, in addition to the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China, which first introduced forward exchange settlement in April, other branches of the Bank of China have also successively opened the service to alleviate the difficulties of exporters. This is the same intention as the Tianjin branch of the Bank of China once held delayed settlement methods under circumstances of the gradually rising exchange rate in the past. Recently, to further facilitate exporters in various places, designated banks in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Wuhan have also obtained the consent of the Bank of China and are preparing to offer this service. The content is roughly as follows:
    (1) Exporters who meet one of the following conditions may apply to the designated bank for forward exchange settlement: (A) Those who hold letters of credit opened from abroad. (B) Those who hold telegrams of foreign transactions and letters of credit can be opened. (C) Those who have sold goods on consignment and have submitted transportation documents to the designated bank for collection of foreign exchange.
    (2) The exporter must sign a forward exchange settlement transaction order with the designated bank, and the exporter must find a reliable guarantor to guarantee the delivery of foreign exchange before the prescribed time limit. The designated bank must sell this forward exchange to the Bank of China piece by piece at any time, sign a forward exchange settlement transaction order, transfer it to the Bank of China, and the delivery period will be determined based on the actual conditions in each location.
    (3) The exchange rate is calculated based on the telegraphic transfer rate on the date the forward exchange settlement transaction order is established.
    (4) For all forward exchange settlement transaction orders, if the due date is later than the expiration date of the foreign exchange transfer period specified on the export permit, the foreign exchange delivery date shall be based on that expiration date; if the transaction order is before that expiration date, the foreign exchange delivery date shall be based on the transaction order's due date.

　　适应物价汇价新情况照顾出口
    中国银行举办预结外汇
    京、津、沪、青、汉各地指定银行，亦已请准开办此项业务。
    【本报讯】为适应物价汇价的新情况，各地中国银行先后举办预结外汇。自全国财经工作统一后，外汇价从四月份开始逐步挂低，尤其自美帝在六月下旬发动侵略朝鲜战事后，美国国内物价上涨，通货贬值，中国银行在七、八两个月内，虽曾数度挂低美汇牌价，但下降的幅度，还远赶不上美元贬值的比例，致使一般出口商均感无法计算成本，对于出口业务难免有所顾虑。针对这种情况，除天津中国银行首先在四月份举办了远期预结外汇外，其他各地的中国银行亦先后开办，借以解除出口商的困难。这正如过去在外汇牌价逐步上涨的情形下，天津中国银行曾经举办延期结汇办法的用意是一样的。最近为使各地出口商更为方便起见，京、津、沪、青、汉各地的指定银行亦已经征得中国银行同意，准备开办此项业务，其内容大致如下：
    （一）出口商具有下例条件之一的得向指定银行申请预结外汇：（甲）持有国外开来信用状者。（乙）持有国外成交电报而信用状即可开到者。（丙）售定代收货物已将运输单据交指定银行代收外汇者。
    （二）出口商须与指定银行签定预结外汇成交单，并由出口商觅具妥保，保证于规定期限前交割外汇，指定银行须随时将此项预结外汇逐笔售与中国银行，签订预结外汇成交单，转让与中国银行，交割期限视各地实际情况而决定。
    （三）结汇率按订立预结外汇成交单日电汇牌价计算。
    （四）凡订立预结外汇成交单，其到期日在出口许可证上所列明之外汇移存期限到期日以后者，其外汇交割日期应以该到期日为准；如成交单在该到期日以前者，其外汇交割日期应以成交单到期日为准。
