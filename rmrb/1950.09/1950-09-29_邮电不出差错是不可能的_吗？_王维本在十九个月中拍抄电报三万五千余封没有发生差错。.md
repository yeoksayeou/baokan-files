　　"Is it impossible for the post and telecommunications to be error-free?"
    Wang Weiben took and copied more than 35,000 telegrams in nineteen months without making a single mistake.
    Wang Weiben, an eighteen-year-old promising young man. Due to his calmness, composure, and conscientiousness in his work, he created the highest national record for eliminating telegraph errors. His name is gloriously circulating among the 190,000 postal and telecommunications employees across the country.
    In March 1948, he was admitted to the Northeast Postal and Telecommunications School. After half a year of study, he was assigned to the Harbin City Telecommunications Bureau as a telegraph operator. When he first started working at the machine, he thought like most people: "Even tigers doze off, let alone people! How can one not make mistakes?"
  Created an unprecedented record in the history of telegraphy for eliminating errors
    After political studies such as open Party building, League building, and rationalization proposals, Wang Weiben's class consciousness rapidly improved. He was determined to eliminate errors. So he persevered for a long time, concentrating all his efforts to realize his ideal. In 1949, Wang Weiben handled more than 20,000 telegrams, with only one minor procedural error, mistaking CODE for COD (which did not affect the text of the telegram). From 1950 to the end of July (a total of 180 days, as he attended meetings for 32 days), he took and copied 15,700 telegrams, and finally achieved 100% elimination of errors while maintaining the current speed. In nineteen months, Wang Weiben took and copied 35,700 telegrams, totaling 1,071,000 words, without any errors, creating an unprecedented new record in the history of telegraphy for eliminating errors. The Telecommunications General Bureau specially issued a notice to the whole country to promote Wang Weiben's experience.
    In April 1950, Wang Weiben gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In May, he attended the National Telecommunications Members' Representative Conference in Beijing as a specially invited representative. Seeing Chairman Mao at this meeting further enhanced his sense of responsibility in his work. Wang Weiben was elected as a model worker of Songjiang Province and was also elected as a representative to attend the National Conference of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.
  Long-term adherence to new working methods
    He felt that technical incompetence was one of the main reasons for errors, and that to eliminate errors, one must improve technology. Therefore, he put effort into technology. Whenever he was on vacation or after work, while others went out to play, he buried himself in studying technology, practicing telegraphy skills, correcting unclear dots and dashes, ensuring that every word was telegraphed correctly, and mastering the technology according to the General Bureau's regulations to achieve correct copying and taking. Whenever he had time, he would get together with other comrades to study. Because he often studied his profession in this way, he finally figured out a way, developed a new set of working methods, and established a good working attitude.
    (1) Developed the habit of "checking after copying." Before copying a telegram, first pay attention to whether the serial numbers are connected, and after completion, check carefully whether there are any missing or duplicate numbers. After copying, write the code name first for each telegram, and then carefully check in sequence whether the names of the sending and receiving bureaus are correct, whether there are any omissions in the header, content, and tail of the telegram in various procedures, whether the font is clear, and whether there are any suspicious points. The checking time for each telegram, even the one with the most words, did not exceed one minute, and generally it took 30-40 seconds. Such checking did not affect the speed of the telegram and played a great role in eliminating errors.
    (2) In order to do a good job, patiently unite with the workers on the other end of the line. For example, on the Mudanjiang line, some telegraph operators telegraphed unclearly and irregularly, so he patiently told them to slow down and not to rush. When some trainees came online on the Bei'an line, Wang Weiben took the initiative to slow down. No matter how bad the other party's technique was, he was not impatient or asked to switch hands, but took the initiative to do well, because he realized that when he first started working at the machine, he was the same way. The more the other party complained, the more flustered he became, and the easier it was to make mistakes. Also, sometimes he greeted the other party first, and if the other party rushed to send first, he would not argue, but wait until he finished copying before sending; if there were too many circular telegrams, he would discuss exchanging copying and taking, trying to avoid disputes, because he knew that conflicts on the machine would affect the speed of telegrams. He exchanged opinions with the other party by telephone on a regular basis, so that he would not only avoid backlog of telegrams but also avoid making mistakes. Not only did he not make mistakes himself, but it also made it difficult for the other party to make mistakes. This is the most difficult thing for telegraph operators to do. Because of this, he has fundamentally eliminated the bad habit of telegraph operators arguing.
    (3) Prepare in advance. Five minutes before each shift, go to the line, sharpen the pencils, and prepare the transfer paper, so as not to grab things in a hurry when working on the machine, avoiding mistakes in the rush and wasting working time.
    (4) The handover system is clear. Five minutes after arriving before work, in addition to preparing the equipment, do the handover work, check whether the serial numbers match, whether there are any missing or duplicate numbers, and whether there are any unresolved problems on the machine (such as inquiry telegrams), as well as the machine line and the situation of the other party. Explain these things clearly to avoid making mistakes because you can't get your bearings after taking over the shift, and do the same when you leave work.
    (5) Observe communication discipline and internal rules, and matters that duty operators should pay attention to on the line. For example, the speed of circular telegrams has never exceeded the stipulated 90 words, and there has never been any arguing on the machine, as well as leaving the machine or joking.
    (6) Work calmly and carefully. No matter what time it is during work, the spirit is concentrated on the telegram, especially on holidays, Sundays, etc. No matter how lively the streets are, it cannot confuse his calm attitude. If he encounters unclear dots and dashes or fonts when taking telegrams, he asks immediately. When proofreading telegrams, he always starts with the address and compares them with the other party group by group, word by word, with a pen. But even this is not enough, as he himself said: "It is the same as making mistakes if you just gesture with your hands and think about other things. You must work with the same spirit as soldiers eliminating enemies on the battlefield."
  Lead the masses and create a new record of collective elimination of errors
    In his spare time, he is often seen with comrades such as Shen Jucai, Chen Zhian, Gao Zhanlin, and Yu Wenhua in dormitories and meeting rooms, studying advanced working methods and business.
    With the help of Comrade Wang Weiben, Shen Jucai, Chen Zhian, Ma Qingfang, and others have not made any mistakes for more than 100 days, and they have all been rewarded. The third team (the team of Comrade Wang Weiben) with all fourteen members, have not made any mistakes for thirty-nine days, and the whole team has been praised, and five of them have been rewarded. Also, six trainee telegraph operators, including Liu Wenbin, have not made any mistakes for fifty days. They have created new records for individuals and collectives in eliminating errors.
    Due to the constant emergence of new records, the entire section was motivated and launched a movement to learn from Wang Weiben's advanced working methods. As a result, the error elimination rate of the entire section decreased more than four times, from 241 errors in October last year to 45 errors at the end of July this year. They are now continuing to move towards the goal of eliminating all errors!

　　“邮电不出差错是不可能的”吗？
    王维本在十九个月中拍抄电报三万五千余封没有发生差错。
    王维本，一个十八岁的有为青年。由于在工作中冷静、沉着、认真，创造了全国消灭电报差错的最高纪录。他的名字在全国十九万邮电员工中光荣地流传着。
    一九四八年三月，他考入东北邮电学校。经过半年的学习，被派到哈尔滨市电信局任报务员。初上机时，他像多数人一样，也这样想过：“老虎还打盹呢，何况是人！那能不出差。”
  创电报历史上消灭差错的空前纪录
    王维本经过公开建党、建团、合理化建议等运动的政治学习，阶级觉悟迅速提高。他决心要消灭差错。于是他长期的坚持、集中全部力量实现自己的理想。王维本从一九四九年全年经他手的二万余封电报，只出了一件手续上的小差错，即将ＣＯＤＥ误为ＣＯＤ（对电报本文并无妨碍）。一九五○年到七月底止（共一百八十天，因有三十二天参加了开会），拍抄一万五千七百封电报，终于在保持现行速度的基础上，达到了百分之百的消灭差错。在十九个月中，王维本拍抄三万五千七百封电报，给一百零七万一千字没出差错，创电报历史上消灭差错空前新纪录。电信总局特通令全国推广王维本经验。
    一九五○年四月，王维本光荣地加入了中国共产党。五月间，又以特邀代表的身份到北京参加了全国电信会员代表大会，在这个会上他看到了毛主席，更提高了他工作的责任心。王维本当选为松江省一等劳动模范，又当选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。
  长期坚持新的工作方法
    他感觉到技术不熟练是造成差错的主要原因之一，要想消灭差错必须提高技术，因此他就在技术上用功夫了。每当休班及下班后，别人都出去玩，他便在屋里埋头钻研技术，练习发报的手法，纠正点划不清，让每一个字都能拍得正确，按着总局的规定，把技术熟练起来，作到正确拍抄。一有空，他就和其他几个同志凑在一起研究。由于他经常这样钻研业务，终于想出门道来了，摸出一套新的工作方法，树立了良好的工作态度。
    （一）养成了“抄完后检查”的习惯。在抄拍报前，先注意流水号是否连接，完后再检查流水号有无漏号或重号。在抄完后，每封都先写代号，后再按顺序细心检查，收发报局名是否对，报头、内容、报尾在各种手续上有无遗漏，书体是否清楚，有无可疑之处。每封检查时间字数最多的没有超过一分钟，一般的是三○——四○秒，这样的检查并没有影响了电报的速度，且对差错的消灭起了很大的作用。
    （二）为了搞好工作，耐心的团结线上对方的工作者。如牡丹江线，有的发报员打的不清和不正规，都耐心的告诉他，应把速度放慢，不要急。北安线有的见习生上线时，王维本就主动的把速度放慢些。无论是对方手法怎样不好也不急燥，也不叫换手，而是主动的作好，因他体会到了自己初学上机时也是一样，对方越吵，就越慌，也就容易出差错了。又如，有时他先招呼对方，对方一出来就争着要先发，自己也不争，等抄完再拍；如通报多了，就商量交换拍抄，尽力避免争吵，因他知道机上冲突，会影响电报速度。他按期用电话和对方交换意见，这样既不会积压电报又不会出差错，不但自己不出差错，使之对方也不容易发生差错，这是报务员最不容易做到的。由于这样，他已根本上消灭了报务员好争吵的不良恶习。
    （三）事先做好准备工作。每回上班前五分钟，就到线上，将铅笔削好，来转报用纸备齐，免得上机工作时乱抓，避免了忙中出错和浪费工作时间。
    （四）接交班制度明确。上班前五分钟来后，除了准备用具外，就做接班工作，看流水号是否相符，有无脱号重号等现象，和机上有无未解决的问题（寻问电报等），以及机器线路，对方有何情况等。这样交待清楚，以免接了班摸不着头绪而出错，自己下班也同样的做到了这些。
    （五）遵守通信纪律和股内制度，及值机员在线上应注意的事项。如通报速度从来没有超过九○字的规定，没有在机上吵过架以及离机或开玩笑等现象。
    （六）工作冷静，细心。在工作中无论什么时间精神都是集中在电报上，尤其是节日，星期日等，街上有什么热闹也混乱不了他冷静的态度。如拍电报遇到点划或书体不清，马上就问。校对电报，都是先由住址开始，按顺序一字一字的用笔一组一组的点着，和对方对照。但是这样还不行，正如他自己所说：“光手比划，心想别的也是一样出错，得要有战士在战场上消灭敌人同样的精神来工作。”
  带动群众，创造集体消灭差错的新纪录
    在业余时间，经常看到他和沈巨才、陈治安、高占林、于文华等同志们，在宿舍，在会议室，研究先进工作方法和业务。
    在王维本同志的多方帮助下，沈巨才、陈治安、马庆芳等，已一百多天没出差错，他们都受到了奖励。第三班（王维本同志那个班）全班十四名，三十九天没出差错，全班受到表扬，其中五名受了奖励。又有刘文斌等六名见习报务员，五十天没出差错。创出了个人的、集体的、消灭差错的新纪录。
    由于不断的涌出了新纪录，鼓动了全股，展开了学习王维本先进工作方法运动，结果全股消灭差错率，由去年十月二四一件，到今年七月末出现了四五件，减少了四倍以上。现正向消灭全部差错的目标继续前进！
