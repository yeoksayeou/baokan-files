Xinhua News Agency, September 21st: The US, British, and French foreign ministers' meeting was held in New York on September 12th, 13th, 14th, and 18th. Various sources indicate that the convening of this meeting is a major step by US imperialism to further expand the war in the East and further organize war preparations in the West. The United States has strongly proposed and coerced Britain and France to accept its comprehensive plan of aggression at the meeting, but it has also been met with stubborn resistance from Britain and France, forcing the meeting to extend beyond its original schedule from the 14th to the 18th before it concluded.

The official communiqué issued by the meeting, as well as the reactionary newspapers and news agencies of the United States, Britain, and France, do not conceal the aggressive purpose of the meeting. Agence France-Presse explicitly called it a "rearmament conference." The communiqué issued on the 14th openly declared: "The three foreign ministers fully agreed that the most urgent issue is to strengthen the defenses (should be read as imperialist aggression) of the free world in both Europe and Asia, and equally agreed that effective steps should be taken immediately to achieve this goal." This indicates that the imperialist bloc has decided to simultaneously advance its war efforts in the East and West.

	Acheson Proposes US Advocated Separate Peace Treaty with Japan

On the Eastern issue, although the meeting communiqué was vague, according to the United Press, the three foreign ministers discussed the Taiwan issue, the Korean issue, and the Southeast Asia issue. The three countries have agreed to convene a three-nation military conference immediately to further suppress the people's liberation movement in Southeast Asia. In addition, Acheson also raised the issue of the United States advocating a unilateral peace treaty with Japan, and during the meeting, Truman issued a statement demanding a separate peace treaty with Japan.

On the Western issue, the three countries issued a lengthy annex simultaneously with the final communiqué on the 19th meeting, nakedly announcing the establishment of "new relations" with the West German puppet state, merging West Germany into the so-called "society of free nations," in order to pave the way for West Germany to participate in the war machine that has already been established under the name of the North Atlantic Treaty. According to the US Information Service on the 19th, the annex to the communiqué announced the steps decided by the three countries: (1) The three governments, as soon as they can take action in accordance with the constitutional provisions of their respective countries, will unilaterally decide on the "steps" to "end the state of war with Germany," but the three countries declared that they will still maintain the "various rights and status" that the three countries now enjoy as occupying powers in West Germany. (2) Allow West Germany to organize mobile "police" forces on a state basis that can be commanded by the Bonn puppet federal government, as a prototype for the establishment of a West German aggressive army. (3) The three countries allow the West German puppet government to establish a Ministry of Foreign Affairs and "establish diplomatic relations with foreign countries." (4) The three countries plan to "expand" the power of the West German puppet government in order to strengthen fascist rule more freely. (5) Revise the current "legislative review system" for West Germany, "thoroughly reduce" the current economic controls, increase the steel production quota in order to expand arms production, and all other bans on non-cartelized and prohibited military production "will be re-examined."

The results of the Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting show that the United States has taken a step forward in its aggressive plans at the meeting.

	No Agreement Reached on Establishing a West European Collective Aggressive Army

The central topic of the meeting was the establishment of a collective aggressive army in Western Europe, especially the establishment of a West German aggressive army, but no agreement was reached on this issue. The United States knew that there were many difficulties in this regard, so it made arrangements before the meeting. US President Truman announced on the 9th that he would greatly increase the number of US troops stationed in Europe, and then announced on the 12th that he would appoint Marshall to replace Johnson as Secretary of Defense, in an attempt to enhance Acheson's capital during negotiations. Agence France-Presse's New York dispatch on the 13th pointed out: "Acheson's attitude at the Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting seems to be closely related to Truman's decision." "General Marshall's appointment and the guarantee of US defense of Europe may be aimed at forcing European countries to agree to the establishment of a German army."

However, despite Truman's bait outside the meeting and Acheson's pressure at the meeting, he still could not force Britain and France to fully submit. The United Press said on the 13th that the progress of the Three Foreign Ministers' Meeting was "slow," and said that "the three foreign ministers are far behind their scheduled agenda." On the 14th, the United Press further pointed out that the reason for the obstacles in the meeting was that on the issue of arming West Germany, "the three foreign ministers have already made a decision on the establishment of a joint command of European defense, but it seems that no agreement can be reached immediately on the issue of arming West Germany. According to official sources, the establishment of a European allied army must first take action on the issue of Germany's participation in West European defense." Regarding the main differences between Britain, France, and the United States on this issue, according to Agence France-Presse on the 14th, "the former only advocates that Germany should have sufficient police forces, while the latter advocates that German troops should be organized under the control of the Allies."

Since the main steps of the US aggressive plan have not been completed at this meeting, the United States is stepping up pressure on Britain and France. According to the final communiqué of the meeting, the three foreign ministers will continue to hold talks during the UN General Assembly.

The commentator Vasilyev pointed out in Pravda's commentary on the New York meeting that the meeting once again proved the disunity within the imperialist camp, and the US imperialists are stepping up pressure on their vassals, demanding that they completely submit. After the US ruling clique launched a criminal war in Korea, it is clearly planning to engage in further aggressive adventures in Asia and Europe. However, the fate of the world does not depend on a small group of anti-peace conspirators, but on hundreds of millions of ordinary people, who are gathering their forces in the massive movement in support of peace.

### 美英法在纽约举行三外长会议决定在东西方扩大侵略  真理报评论指出：会议再度证明帝国主义阵营内部的不一致。

　　美英法在纽约举行三外长会议决定在东西方扩大侵略
    真理报评论指出：会议再度证明帝国主义阵营内部的不一致。
    【新华社二十一日讯】美、英、法三国外长会议已于九月十二、十三、十四、十八四日在纽约举行。各方消息显示：这个会议的召开乃是美帝国主义在东方进一步扩大战争，在西方进一步组织战争准备的重大步骤。美国已在会上强力提出并胁迫英法两国接受其全面侵略计划，但是也受到了英法的顽梗抵抗，使会议不得不超出原定日程，自十四日起延期至十八日方告结束。
    会议发表的官方公报以及美、英、法三国反动报纸与通讯社毫不讳言会议的侵略目的。法新社明白地把它称为“重整军备会议”。会议十四日公报公然宣称：“三外长完全同意：最急迫的是在欧亚两洲加强自由世界防务（应读为帝国主义侵略）的问题，并同样同意：为达到这个目的，应立即采取有效步骤。”这就表示了帝国主义集团已决定在东西两方同时推进其战争努力。
  艾奇逊提出美国主张对日单独媾和
    在东方问题上，虽然会议公报讳莫如深，但是据合众社称：三外长已讨论了台湾问题、朝鲜问题与东南亚问题。三国已同意为进一步镇压东南亚人民解放运动而即行召开三国军事会议。此外，艾奇逊也提出了美国主张片面对日媾和的问题，而在会议期间，杜鲁门就提出了要求单独缔结对日和约的声明。
    在西方问题上，三国已在十九日会议发表最后公报同时，发表了一个长篇附件，赤裸裸地宣布要与西德傀儡国家建立“新的关系”，将西德合并入所谓“自由国家的社会之内”，以便为使西德参加已在北大西洋公约的名义下成立的战争机器铺平道路。据美国新闻处十九日讯：公报附件宣布三国已决定的步骤是：（一）三国政府一俟依据各该国宪法规定可以采取行动时，即行片面决定“结束对德战争状态”的“步骤”，但是三国声明仍然要保持三国现在作为占领国而在西德享有的“各种权利与地位”。（二）准许西德在州的基础上组织能由波恩傀儡联邦政府指挥的机动“警察”部队，以作为建立西德侵略军的雏型。（三）三国准许西德傀儡政府成立外交部，并“与外国建立外交关系”。（四）三国计划“扩大”西德傀儡政府的权力，以便更放手加强法西斯统治。（五）修改目前对西德的“立法审查制度”，“彻底削减”目前的经济管制，提高钢的生产限额，以便扩大军火生产，其他一应非卡德尔化与禁止军事生产的禁令“均将重新审查”。
    三外长会议的结果显示，美国已在会上把它的侵略计划推进了一步。
  建立西欧集体侵略军问题未获协议
    关于在西欧建立集体侵略军，特别是在建立西德侵略军的问题，是会议的中心议题，但是，在这个问题上并未获致协议。美国深知在这方面存在着重重困难，因此曾在会前作了部署。美国总统杜鲁门于九日宣布大量增加美国驻欧军队，接着又在十二日宣布任命马歇尔代詹逊为国防部长，就是为了企图增强艾奇逊在谈判时的资本。法新社纽约十三日电即指出：“艾奇逊在三外长会议上所采取的态度似乎与杜鲁门的决定密切相连”。“马歇尔将军的任命与美国驻防欧洲的保证，也许旨在使欧洲国家勉强答应德国军队的建立”。
    然而，尽管杜鲁门在会外放下了这样的钓饵，而艾奇逊又在会上使尽压力，却仍然不能压迫英、法完全就范。合众社十三日曾说：三外长会议进展是“缓慢”的，并说“三强外长远落于他们所定议程之后”。十四日合众社更指出：会议发生障碍的原因，就是在武装西德的问题上，“三外长对于成立欧洲防务的联合统帅部已有决定，但对武装西德问题似乎尚无法立即获得协议。而据官方人士称，建立欧洲联军，却必须对德国参加西欧防务一事先采取行动”。关于英、法与美国间对于这一问题的主要分歧，据法新社十四日称，“是前者仅主张使德国有足够的警察部队，而后者主张在盟国管制下组编德国军队”。
    由于美国侵略计划的主要步骤，并未能在此次会议上完成，美国仍加紧对英法施用压力。据会议最后公报宣布，三外长将在联大开会期间继续进行会谈。
    真理报评论家瓦西里耶夫在评论纽约会议时指出：会议再度证明了帝国主义阵营内部的不一致，美帝国主义者加紧对他们的家臣们施用压力，要他们完全俯首贴耳。美国统治集团在朝鲜发动了罪恶的战争以后，显然正计划在亚洲和欧洲从事进一步的侵略冒险，然而世界的命运不是取决于一小撮反和平的阴谋家，而是取决于亿万普通人民，他们正在声势浩大的拥护和平运动中集合他们的队伍。
