　　Beijing Suburbs Elect Agricultural Labor Model Representative
    Liu Jinrong Honorably Elected
    [Beijing News Agency] The agricultural labor model representative from the capital's suburbs to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers has been selected. The elected representative is Liu Jinrong, a farmer from Liulangzhuang in the 13th District. He has made outstanding achievements in leading the masses to build water conservancy projects and eliminate pests.
    In early August, farmers from various villages gathered to elect village labor model representatives by comparing labor, production, and inventions. Then, district labor models were selected from among the village labor model representatives. The labor models from the seven districts are: Bai Yushan from the 10th District, Gao Shuzhen (female) from the 11th District, Yin Weichen from the 12th District, Liu Jinrong from the 13th District, Wang Jinfu from the 14th District, Cui Qingde from the 15th District, and Wang Sufen (female) from the 16th District. All seven are newly emancipated peasants. Four of them used to "carry long burdens" for landlords, and two of them were hired for "odd jobs" year-round. After liberation, through land reform, they were allocated land, houses, and farm tools, making them exceptionally active in production. Due to their struggle against the landlords, their class consciousness has been raised, and six of them have joined the Communist Party of China.
    On August 28th, the Suburban Committee of the Municipal Government and the Municipal Farmers' Association convened a meeting of district labor model representatives. After the seven labor models reported on their exemplary deeds, they proceeded to elect a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. As a result, Liu Jinrong was elected with six votes.
    The good news spread to Liulangzhuang. The farmers were delighted and said, "Our village's Liu Jinrong has won first place!" They all felt it was a great honor for the village. The young people said, "When the labor model goes to the city for the meeting, we will send him off with gongs and drums, dancing the Yangko."

　　京郊选举农业劳模代表
    刘金荣光荣当选
    【京市新闻处讯】首都郊区参加全国工农兵劳动模范会议的农业劳动模范代表已经选出。当选的是第十三区六郎庄农民刘金荣。他在领导群众兴修水利，除灭虫害方面有着卓著的成绩。
    八月上旬，各村农民纷纷集会、用比劳动、比生产、比发明来选举村劳模代表，然后在村劳模代表中选出区劳动模范。七个区的劳动模范是：十区白玉山，十一区高淑珍（女），十二区殷维臣，十三区刘金荣，十四区王进富，十五区崔清德，十六区王素芬（女）。七个人都是新翻身的农民。他们当中有四个人以前给地主“扛长活”，两个人常年卖“零工”。解放后，经过土地改革，分得土地房屋和农具，生产分外积极。由于和地主作斗争，提高了阶级觉悟，他们中有六个人已经参加了中国共产党。
    八月二十八日，市府郊委会与市农会召集区劳模代表会议。七个劳动模范报告了自己的模范事迹后，即进行选举出席全国工农兵劳动模范会议的代表。结果刘金荣以六票当选。
    喜讯报到六郎庄。农民们都欣喜地说：“咱村的刘金荣中状元啦！”都觉得这是村子的莫大光荣。青年们说：“赶到劳动模范进城开会，咱们敲着锣鼓，扭着秧歌送他去。”
