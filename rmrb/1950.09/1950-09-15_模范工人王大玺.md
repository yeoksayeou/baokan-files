　　Model Worker Wang Daxi
    Chen Qi
    The Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory was short of oxygen, so the gas cutter seemed difficult to use, and the iron plates could not be cut; stamping, flattening, and drafting all came to a standstill.
    August was about to pass, and the September tasks were about to be issued, but without oxygen, what could be done?
    Using a drill was too inefficient, drilling at most one meter per hour! The factory director and the chairman of the trade union branch were worried about this.
    On August 27th, the factory held a production plan discussion meeting, and the method of cutting iron plates was temporarily resolved. This was thanks to Wang Daxi.
    Wang Daxi is an old worker at the Bridge Factory, a Communist Party member, and his specialty is the pneumatic chisel. He has earned three minor merits on the production front and has created new records five times. He was selected as a first-class model worker by the entire factory on May 1st this year.
    At the production plan discussion meeting, when the chairman of the trade union branch called on everyone to think of solutions, Wang Daxi, thinking of the importance of the September production tasks, mustered his courage and proposed using the pneumatic chisel to replace the gas cutter to overcome the difficulty of no oxygen. His suggestion was supported by the entire team.
    On August 27th, he confidently began the work of replacing the gas cutter with a pneumatic chisel. When he started the pneumatic chisel, he bent over and lowered his head, cutting three meters of iron plate per hour. The pneumatic chisel "tuck-tuck" sounded, making his ears ache, but he persisted in this work. Under his encouragement and inspiration, the workers all used pneumatic chisels to cut iron plates. The factory was filled with the sound of "tuck-tuck". Thus, this Bridge Factory, which was about to shut down, once again showed a lively atmosphere.

　　模范工人王大玺
    陈绮
    山海关桥梁工厂因为氧气不够，瓦斯切断器看来很难使用，铁板也就没法切断；冲眼的、平板的、现图的都没有工作了。
    八月就要过去，九月份的任务就要下来，可是没有氧气，怎么办呢？
    用钻头钻，效力太差了，每小时最多钻一米长！场主任和工会支会主任因此愁坏了。
    八月二十七日，厂里召开了生产计划讨论会，切割铁板的办法暂时解决了。这是王大玺的功劳。
    王大玺是桥梁工厂的老工人，共产党员，他拿手的技术是风铲。他前后在生产战线上曾立过三小功，共创造新纪录五次。今年五月一日被全厂选为一等模范。
    生产计划讨论会上，工会支会主任号召大家想办法的时候，王大玺想到九月份生产任务的重大，便鼓足勇气，提出用风铲去代替瓦斯切断器，以克服无氧气的困难。他的意见得到全组的响应。
    八月二十七日，他满有信心地开始了以风铲代替瓦斯切断器的工作。他开动风铲的时候，躬着腰，低着头，每小时铲断三米铁板。风铲“得得”地响着，把他的耳朵震得发痛，而他坚持着这个工作。工人们在他的鼓舞与感召之下，都以风铲来切割铁板。工厂到处是一片“得得”的声音。于是，这个即将停工的桥梁工厂，重新表现了生气勃勃的气象。
