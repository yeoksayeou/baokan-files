　　Once, I Killed Twenty Enemies with a Bayonet

　　I am from Qianqingyangyu Village, Third District, Xingtai, and I am forty-four years old this year. I started doing long-term labor at seventeen and did it for fifteen years. At the end of 1937, the Eighth Route Army came to southern Hebei, and I and eight other young people from my village joined the Eastward Advance Column of the 129th Division, assigned to the Second Regiment, which was later changed to the New Fourth Brigade. We fought back and forth on the vast plains of Hebei and Shandong.

　　In June 1938, I joined the Communist Party. Soon after, in July, our troops attacked Xiajin County, Shandong, where more than 1,700 "puppet troops" were stationed. After fighting for a day and two nights, the enemy was pushed back into a village, but the eight Japanese devils inside forced the puppet army to concentrate all their firepower and break through. At that time, I was a political soldier in the First Company of the Second Regiment. As a political soldier, I had to play a role in mobilizing and leading the way. After the general attack order was issued, I put forward the slogan: "Don't let the enemy escape, carry forward the fighting style of the people's army!" The whole platoon rushed up, and I myself charged at the very front. The bayonet fight began. Three puppet soldiers charged at me with their bright bayonets. I gritted my teeth, steeled my heart, gripped the rifle in my hand, took a flying step forward, forcefully deflected one enemy's blade, and with a backhand thrust, stabbed the enemy in the throat. The other two were startled, and I turned and stabbed another one to the ground. The third enemy parried a few times, but he was also stabbed to death on the ground. Because I used too much force, the bayonet was stuck in the ground. I was pulling the bayonet out when I suddenly heard two more enemies coming up behind me. I quickly turned around and kicked down the first one rushing at me. In the blink of an eye, the other enemy was also stabbed down by me. After several rounds, twenty puppet soldiers returned to their hometowns under my bayonet. The puppet soldiers were so frightened that they handed over their guns and surrendered. Unexpectedly, a puppet soldier suddenly stabbed at me from the side, the knife landing squarely on my right leg. The pain made me sit down on the ground. The puppet soldier pulled back his gun and stabbed at me again, but I had a bullet in my gun and shot the enemy dead. After the battle, I alone had killed twenty-seven enemies and obtained fifteen guns. I was so happy that I forgot about my leg injury and walked back to the team. The next day, from a combination of the injury and exhaustion, I couldn't move at all. Soon, my story spread throughout the regiment, and the entire regiment selected me as a first-class combat hero.

　　Later, I received several months of training and went back to serve as the training captain of the Youth Column. When the Youth Column was reorganized into the New Fourth Brigade, I became the company commander of the Fifth Company. I was tall and big, and very brave. I had learned a few words of Mongolian when I ran outside the pass as a child, so everyone gave me the nickname "Old Mongol," and our company was called the "Mongol Team."

　　Broke Through Five Layers of Enemy Encirclement

　　In the summer of 1940, I participated in the famous Hundred Regiments Offensive. Our company's task was to attack Gaoyi Station. The enemies were all squeezed behind an earthen wall next to the railroad tracks. A gun emplacement was dug in the wall, and a Nambu machine gun was extended from there, severely blocking our offensive path. The team charged more than ten times, but was beaten back each time, and more than ten comrades sacrificed themselves there. The task was very urgent. At this time, I looked at the enemy's fortifications and decided to overcome all difficulties to seize the enemy's machine gun, so that the team could charge up. I immediately reported to the battalion commander that I would complete this task, and said, "If I can't come back, the platoon leader will act as the agent." After speaking, I led five soldiers from the sorghum field to the bottom of the wall. The six of us together pulled the pins on twelve hand grenades and threw them over the wall. Taking advantage of the smoke and fire, I went up and grabbed the hot machine gun barrel with one hand, and snatched the machine gun out of the gun emplacement. Then the team charged in. When I opened my right hand, it was covered in blood, and the skin was stuck to the machine gun. After this battle, the entire New Fourth Brigade called me the hero company commander, and our company became the hero company.

　　In 1942, I was promoted to deputy captain of the teaching team of the New Fourth Brigade, and soon I caught up with the "April 29th" great "mopping-up" operation in southern Hebei. This "mopping-up" operation was carried out by tens of thousands of enemies, and it was very cruel. The directly subordinate team of our brigade was surrounded in Hougezhuang, Qiuxian County. At that time, I was ordered to lead the team to break through the encirclement. I gathered six machine guns, took the lead myself, and charged towards the puppet army's position. I broke through five layers of enemy encirclement in one go. My right leg had already been shot through by a bullet, but I was still commanding the charge forward, when a bullet hit my left leg bone again, and I could no longer walk. The enemies were chasing after me, and the team was also far away. I gritted my teeth and endured the pain, crawling on my hands in the wilderness. It was difficult to crawl to the village, but there were enemies at the entrance of the village, so I had to crawl back outside the village. Several times I fainted from the pain, and several times I woke up. Once I fell into a ditch and passed away, and twice I mistakenly crawled to the door of the puppet army's bad guy's house, and was almost killed. Several times at night, I ran into enemies and was almost captured. Like this, I spent seven days and seven nights in the wilderness, and finally our people found me and sent me to the hospital.

　　Disguised to Capture Japanese Secret Agents

　　After being discharged from the hospital that winter, my waist and legs were disabled, and I could no longer fight with the troops. The superiors took care of me and asked me to go to the rear to rest. Under the education of the Party, I had long understood that: as a Communist Party member, you must have an indomitable spirit. As long as you have a breath, you should do more for the people. Later, after my request, the superiors sent me to work in the brigade's armed work team, operating in the enemy-occupied areas of Pingxiang and Guantao. At first, I disguised myself as an old farmer, wearing a tattered sheepskin coat, and didn't wash my face all day long. I lived in the homes of the common people and helped them with their work. At that time, in the village where I lived, almost every family's manure slope had the manure I picked, and every family's firewood pile had the firewood I picked up. After the mass work was done well, I had a reliable cover. Then I began to win over and disintegrate the puppet "Great Township Self-Defense Corps." Slowly, many puppet self-defense corps were taken over by us and became our armed forces. When the enemy came out, I would take them to fight. If we could win, we would fight; if we couldn't win, we would disperse. Because we had the masses as our backing, the enemy couldn't figure out what was going on.

　　The most interesting thing was the capture of the Japanese secret agent Ogasa. In advance, I disguised myself and entered Pingxiang City to reconnoiter. In a tea shop, I learned that Ogasa would go outside the city tomorrow to "inspect the ditch." Immediately I hurried out of the city. As soon as I came out of the west exit, the card was put on. I only heard the people along the road say: "The city is under martial law! I heard that 'Old Mongol' entered the city, and the devils want to catch him." I thought to myself with a smile: "Japanese devils want to catch me? Let's see who catches who!" The next day, I took three people, carried iron shovels, and pretended to be ditch-digging laborers, and went to the edge of the blockade ditch. I looked carefully: that's right, Ogasa was there inspecting. He was holding a small book, scribbling and drawing, and he was very happy. After a while, I looked for an opportunity and winked at the people I brought. Everyone rushed up. I said to Ogasa: "The captain invites you to go!" Without waiting for a reply, a comrade picked him up, and the other two comrades also pulled the horse over, and the comrade jumped on the horse, took Ogasa, and ran away quickly. At this time, I shouted loudly: "Folks, run away! The Japanese were caught by the Eighth Route Army!" In the chaos, I returned to the village safe and sound. For this matter, the enemy mobilized a lot of troops from Shijiazhuang, Handan, and Xingtai... and carried out "mopping-up" operations everywhere, trying to catch us. As a result, they were empty-handed everywhere.

　　"We Will Never Let the American Devils Occupy an Inch of Our Land!"

　　In the spring of 1943, our armed work team of seven people was surrounded in the village by three hundred devils and four hundred puppet soldiers. The captain and political commissar ordered everyone to fight a "curtain-picking battle." As soon as a devil lifted the curtain, he lost his life. We fought seven hundred enemies in this house for four hours, killing eleven devils, and finally broke through from the village. Not many days later, the enemy searched for the entrance to my hiding hole and fired two grenades into it. Fortunately, one of them didn't explode. As soon as the enemy left, I came out and caught a secret agent who was harming the common people in the village. The most dangerous time was one morning in June, when the sky was still dark, and the enemy suddenly surrounded the village. As soon as I opened my eyes, the devils had already entered the house. The devils searched out my disability certificate, determined that I was an Eighth Route Army soldier, and raised their guns to stab me. I dodged, and the devils were about to pull the bolt to shoot me, so I grabbed the bolt with one hand. The devils had no other way to think, so they shouted desperately. I originally wanted to pull him down, but I was afraid of implicating the people in the village, so I decided to go with them. The enemies tied my left arm with a leather belt, and four devils escorted me away. Not far out of the village, I pretended to say that my left arm "hurt too much." The four dog-like devils really came close to look at me. I unexpectedly raised my iron fist and knocked down three enemies. The remaining devil was also taken away by me, and I also used both hands to lift this devil and smash him hard at the enemies. The four devils were beaten dizzy, with broken noses and swollen faces. I took the opportunity to run away and continue my work.

　　In this way, I continued to fight until the Japanese devils surrendered. In the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, I was wounded eight times, and I was selected as a combat hero eight times in our brigade. After 1947, in order to take care of my disability, the superiors transferred me to work in the rear. Now I am doing people's armed work in the Xingtai Military Region.

　　My shortcoming is that I have never liked to study, and I still don't know many characters, so my progress is very slow. This time when I go back, I must do a good job in learning and do a good job in the militia armed work that I do. Now the American devils want to come and make trouble again. Although I am over forty years old and my body is disabled, I will never let the American devils occupy an inch of our land! I can't walk, but I can still fight with a bayonet!

　　“决不让美国鬼子占去我们一寸土地！”
    ——战斗英雄吕俊生自述

  一次用刺刀刺死二十个敌人
    我是邢台三区前清阳峪村的人，今年四十四岁。打十七岁扛长活，扛了十五年。一九三七年底，八路军来到冀南，我就和本村的八个青年一块参加了一二九师东进纵队，编在第二团，后来改成新四旅，一直在河北山东大平原上打来打去。
    一九三八年六月，我参加了共产党。紧跟着，七月我们部队就打山东夏津县，那里住着一千七百多个“皇协军”。打了一天两夜，敌人被我们压到一个村子里，可是里面的八个日本鬼子却逼着伪军集中了全部火力向外突围。那工夫，我在二团一连当政治战士。当政治战士，是要起鼓动作用和带头作用的。总攻击令下了以后，我就提出口号：“不要让敌人跑掉，发扬人民军队的战斗作风！”全排突了上去，我自己冲在最前面。白刃战开始了，三个伪军端着明晃晃的刺刀冲过来，我把牙一咬，心一横，握紧了手里的枪，一个箭步迎上去，用力拨过一个敌人的刀锋，反手一枪刺中了敌人的咽喉。那两个吓的一怔，又叫我回手刺倒一个，第三个敌人招架了几下，也叫我一枪戳死在地上，因为我用力过猛，刺刀也戳进地里去了。我正往外拔刺刀，猛听身后又上来两个敌人，我急忙回身，一脚踢倒那首先扑来的一个，转眼间，另一个敌人也叫我刺倒了，打了几个回合，二十个伪军都在我的刺刀下回了老家。伪军们吓得纷纷交枪投降。想不到这时忽然一个伪军由侧面向我刺过来，一刀正扎在我的右腿上，疼得我当下坐在地上。那伪军抽回枪再向我刺来，我枪里有子弹，一枪把敌人打死。战斗完了，光我一个人就杀死了二十七个敌人，得了十五支枪。我高兴得忘记了腿伤，走着回队，第二天连伤带累就一点也不能动弹了。不久，我的事情传遍了全团，全团选我当了一等战斗英雄。
    后来我受了几个月的训，回去就担任青年纵队的训练队长；青年纵队改编新四旅，我就当了五连连长。我的身子又高又大，人又勇敢，我小时跑口外又学会了几句蒙古话，大家就给我起了个外号叫“老蒙古”，管我们连叫“蒙古队”。
  冲破了敌人五层包围
    一九四○年夏天，我参加了有名的百团大战，我们连的任务是攻打高邑车站。敌人都挤在铁道旁边一堵土墙后面，墙上挖了一个枪眼，一挺歪把子机枪从那里伸出来，把我们进攻的道路封锁得严严的，队伍冲锋十几次都被打回来了，十几个同志牺牲在那里，任务又紧得很。这时，我看了一下敌人的工事，就决心克服一切困难去夺敌人的机枪，好叫队伍冲上去。我当下报告了营长去完成这个任务，并说：“我要回不来，一排长作代理人”，说完就带了五个战士从高粱地转到墙底下；六个人一齐拉开了十二个手榴弹，隔墙扔了进去，乘着这烟火飞腾的时候，我上去一手抓住火烫的机枪筒，从枪眼里把机枪夺了出来，跟着队伍就冲进去了。当我张开右手时，只见满手尽血，皮都沾到机枪上了。从这次战斗以后，全新四旅都叫我英雄连长，我们的连也成了英雄连。
    一九四二年，我被提升做新四旅教导队的副队长，不久就赶上了冀南的“四二九”大“扫荡”。这次“扫荡”，敌人开来了好几万，非常残酷。我们旅的直属队在邱县后各庄被包围了，当下我受领了带队突围的任务，集中六挺机枪，自己带头，向伪军阵地冲去，一股作气冲破了敌人五层包围，我右腿早给子弹打穿了，但还是指挥着向前冲，那知一颗子弹又打中了我的左腿骨，再也不能走了，敌人又追上来，队伍也走远了，我就咬着牙忍着痛，用两只手在野地里爬着，好容易爬到村里，可是村口有敌人，只得又爬回村外，几次痛得晕过去，又几次醒转来，曾经一次摔到沟里死过去，两次误爬到伪军坏蛋的家门，险些叫人害死，也曾经好几次在夜里和敌人碰了头，险些被捉了去，像这样，在野地里过了七天七夜，最后才叫我们的人寻着送到医院去。
  化装捕捉日本特务
    那年冬天出院后，我的腰和腿都落了残疾，再不能跟部队打仗了。上级为了照顾我，叫我到后方去休息。在党的教育下，我早就明白了：做共产党员，要有百折不挠的精神，只要自己还有一口气，就应该替老百姓多干些事情。后来，经过我的请求，上级就派我到旅的武工队工作，在平乡、馆陶一带敌占区活动。开头，我化装老百姓，穿一件破羊皮袄，成天价连脸也不洗，我住在老百姓家里，净帮老百姓干活。那时候，我住的那村，差不多谁家的粪坡上都有我检的粪，谁家的柴火堆上都有我拾的柴火。群众工作做好了，我才有了可靠的掩护。然后就开始争取瓦解伪大乡自卫团。慢慢许多伪自卫团都叫我们掌握住了，变成了我们的武装。敌人一出来，我就带他们去打，打得过就打，打不过就分散，因为我们有群众做靠山，敌人也弄不清是怎么回子事。
    最有意思的是捕捉日本特务小笠那回事。事先，我化装进平乡城去侦察，在一家茶叶店里，打听到小笠明天到城外去“验沟”。当下我就赶出城来。刚出西口，卡子就上上了。只听得沿路的老百姓说：“城里戒严了！听说‘老蒙古’进了城，鬼子要抓他。”我心里笑着想：“日本鬼子想抓我？看谁抓谁吧！”第二天，我带了三个人，扛上铁铣装成挖沟的民伕，去到封锁沟边。我仔细一看：正好，小笠就在那里检查?こ獭Ｃ挥斜鸬娜毡救耍?挥幸黄コ寺硭┰诼放缘氖魃稀Ｕ馐保?倚闹?好生高兴。过了一会，我瞅个空子，朝我带去的人使了个眼色，大家都冲了上去。我对小笠说：“队长请你去！”等不得回话，一个同志就把他抱起，另外二个同志也把乘马拉了过来，那个同志就跳上马去，带着小笠，飞快的跑走了。这时，我大声喊叫：“老乡们快跑呵！日本人叫八路军抓走了！”在人慌马乱当中，我安安生生回到村子里。敌人为这件事，从石家庄、从邯郸、从邢台……开来了好多兵力，四下“扫荡”，想抓我们。结果到处都扑了空。
  “决不让美国鬼子占去我们一寸土地！”
    一九四三年春天，我们武工队七个人，叫三百鬼子和四百伪军围在村子里，队长和政委命令大家打“挑帘战”，一个鬼子刚一掀门帘便丧了命，我们在这所房子里和七百敌人打了四点钟，拚死十一个鬼子，最后才从村中突围出去。隔了不多天，敌人搜到我藏身的地洞口，连着向里打了两个手榴弹，幸亏一个没响。敌人才走，我就出来捉住一个特务，他正在村中糟害老百姓。最危险的一次，是在六月的一个早晨，天还不明，敌人突然包围了村子，我刚一睁眼，鬼子已经进了屋子。鬼子搜出来我的残废证，认定我是八路军，提起枪来就刺我，我闪了过去，鬼子又要拉栓打死我，我就一手抓住枪栓，鬼子再也没法可想，就死命喊叫。我本想拉掉他，又怕连累村里老百姓，就拿定主意跟他们走。敌人拿皮带捆上我的左胳臂，四个鬼子押着我走，刚出村不远，我就伪装说左胳臂“太痛”，四个傻狗样的鬼子都当真地凑近来看我，我猛不防举起了铁拳，打倒了三个敌人，剩下的一个鬼子也叫我夺了大枪，我又用双手举起这鬼子狠命地朝那几个敌人砸过去，四个鬼子被打得头懵眼花，鼻破脸肿，我就乘机跑了，又坚持我的工作。
    就这样，我一直斗争到日本鬼子投了降。算起来在八年抗战中，我负过八次伤，在我们旅八次选成战斗英雄。一九四七年以后，上级为了照顾我的残废，才把我调到后方工作。现在邢台军分区搞人民武装工作。
    我的缺点是从来不爱学习，到现在还识字不多，因此进步很慢。这次回去，我一定要把学习搞好，把我所作的民兵武装工作做好。现在美国鬼子又想来捣乱了。虽然我已经四十多岁，身子骨也残废了，但是我决不让美国鬼子占去我们一寸土地！我走路不行，拚刺刀还行的！
