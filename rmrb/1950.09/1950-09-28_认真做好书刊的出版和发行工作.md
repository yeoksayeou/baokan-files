Following the Second National Working Conference of Xinhua Bookstore, the Central People's Government's Publishing Administration held the First National Publishing Conference. Both conferences are very important. Their importance lies in the fact that books and magazines are powerful weapons for organizing our national life and promoting national construction. The masses of people who have begun to live a new life are increasingly demanding various publications to satisfy their cultural needs. Therefore, all the efforts made by publishing workers to improve their work have aroused the concern and attention of the broad masses of people.

The publication and distribution of books and periodicals is a serious political task. However, in the past, most publishers tended to pursue profits and lacked a sense of responsibility to the people. State-owned bookstores represented by Xinhua Bookstore have also made the mistake of overemphasizing business interests and neglecting readers' needs. This purely economic point of view should be resolutely corrected. Of course, neglecting the interests of business operations and making it impossible to expand publication and distribution work is also an erroneous tendency that should be corrected.

When we say that the publication and distribution of books and periodicals is a serious political task, it does not mean that we should only pay attention to the publication and distribution of political books. On the contrary, since the national construction is now unfolding in all aspects, and the content of people's cultural demands is becoming richer and more complex, all books and periodicals related to national construction and people's lives should be fully published and distributed. If the publication and distribution work is limited to a narrow range of publications, it is precisely a manifestation of a lack of political understanding.

In order to develop people's publishing work in a planned way, both public and private publishing industries should make necessary adjustments and improvements in organizational structure and working methods. Because the constituent members of the public and private publishing industries are mostly small production units (Xinhua Bookstore was also a small production unit scattered across the country before it was unified nationwide), there has always been a lack of organization and planning in the publishing industry, which has resulted in various phenomena of duplication, waste, and confusion. This Xinhua Bookstore conference has decided to further unify the national distribution institutions under its jurisdiction, and to establish various national and local publishing houses in a planned way. This publishing conference has also decided to establish close ties between public and private publishing industries under the principle of overall planning and consideration, division of labor and cooperation, so as to carry out the work of book and periodical production and distribution in a planned and organized manner. These steps are necessary for the sound development of people's publishing industry. We hope that both public and private publishing industries can improve their business management methods in order to satisfy readers' wishes to obtain more, better, and cheaper books.

We also hope that various departments in the central and local governments, various people's organizations, and various research institutions will pay attention to the publishing industry, because books and periodicals are weapons that should be used in any aspect. Only when all parties use this effective tool can the books and periodicals that meet the needs of the people be continuously enriched.

### 认真做好书刊的出版和发行工作

　　认真做好书刊的出版和发行工作
    中央人民政府出版总署继全国新华书店第二届工作会议之后，又举行了第一届全国出版会议。这两个会议都是很重要的。其所以重要，就因为，书籍和杂志是组织我们的国家生活，推进国家的建设事业的一种有力的武器。开始过着新的生活的人民大众，愈来愈迫切地要求各种各样的出版物来满足他们的文化要求，因此，出版工作者为改进他们的事业而作的一切努力，也就引起广大人民的关心和重视。
    书刊的出版和发行是一个严重的政治任务。但过去大多数的出版商往往热中于追逐利润，而缺乏对人民负责的精神。以新华书店为代表的国家书店，也曾犯过过分看重营业利益而很少为读者打算的错误。这种单纯经济观点是应该坚决纠正的。当然，不顾企业经营的利益，使出版发行工作无法扩大，也是一种应该纠正的错误倾向。
    我们说书刊的出版发行工作是一个严重的政治任务，并不是说我们只应该去注意政治书籍的出版和发行。相反，由于现在国家建设事业正在从各方面展开，人民的文化要求的内容也愈来愈丰富而复杂，因此，凡是与国家建设和人民生活需要有关的书刊都应当充分地出版和发行。如果把出版发行工作限制于狭小范围的出版物中，那就恰恰是缺少政治认识的表现了。
    为了有计划地发展人民出版工作，无论公私出版业，都应当在组织机构与工作方法上进行必要的调整与改进。由于公私营出版业的组成分子大部分都是小生产单位（新华书店在全国未统一以前，也是分散各地的小生产单位），所以在出版事业中向来是缺乏组织与计划的，因此就发生了种种重复浪费混乱的现象。这次新华书店会议已经决定把所属的全国发行机构进一步统一起来，并有计划地分别建立各个全国性的和地方性的出版社。这次出版会议，又决定了在统筹兼顾，分工合作的原则下使公私出版事业之间建立密切联系，以便有计划有组织地进行书刊的生产与发行的工作。这些步骤都是人民出版事业的健全发展所必需的。我们希望，公私出版业都能为了满足读者获得更多更好更便宜的书的愿望，而来改进他们的企业经营的方法。
    我们并希望，中央和地方的政府中的各个部门和各人民团体各研究机关，都来关心出版事业，因为书籍和期刊对于任何方面说起来都是应该加以运用的一种武器。只有在各方面都来运用这个有效工具的情形下，合于人民所需要的书刊才能不断地丰富起来。
