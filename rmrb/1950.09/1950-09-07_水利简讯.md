　　The Urumqi River levee construction project in Dihua City, Xinjiang Province, was successfully completed at the end of June. The project, which started in early May, involved the construction of more than 4,600 meters of new levees and the renovation of 440 meters of old levees. Participants included cadres from various agencies in Dihua City, soldiers, students, and citizens of all ethnic groups.
　　The Shanshui Gully dredging project in Lingwu County, Ningxia Province, was successfully completed on July 10th after 70 days of intensive work by more than 2,000 Hui and Han laborers, completing all 370,000 cubic meters of earthwork. The completion of this project will alleviate the flooding that has plagued the county for decades, restore 170,000 mu of previously eroded land to cultivation, and further solve the irrigation problems for more than 200,000 mu of farmland in the county.
　　To prepare for the autumn flood season, governments at all levels in Zhejiang Province are currently leading farmers in various areas to fully carry out levee inspection and repair work. More than 50 dangerous sections along the Puyang River have been repaired by farmers along the river and were completed by the end of July. Six counties in the Jinhua area simultaneously repaired 1,240 large and small water conservancy projects. Full preparations have also been made for flood prevention work throughout the province.
