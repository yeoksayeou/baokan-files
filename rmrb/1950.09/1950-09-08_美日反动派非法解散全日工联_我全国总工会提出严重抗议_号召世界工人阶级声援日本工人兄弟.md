Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Regarding the illegal dissolution of the All-Japan Federation of Trade Union Liaison Council by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions has issued a protest. The original text of the protest is as follows:

On August 30th, under the instruction of MacArthur, the U.S. imperialist aggressor in Japan and invader of Korea and Taiwan, the Japanese puppet government ordered the dissolution of the All-Japan Federation of Trade Union Liaison Council, and at the same time "rectified" twelve cadres of the trade union. The news has arrived, and the Chinese working class is infinitely angry and lodges a serious protest.

This measure by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries completely violates the Potsdam Declaration and the decisions of the Far Eastern Commission. The Potsdam Declaration clearly stipulates that Japan should be led onto the path of democratization and demilitarization. The Far Eastern Commission also decided that "trade unions should be allowed to participate in political activities and support political parties" and that "trade unions should be encouraged to participate in the democratization process in Japan... such as the implementation of the elimination of militarism and monopoly capital." Therefore, this action of the Japanese puppet government is completely illegal.

Since the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries illegally "rectified" members of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party in June, they have subsequently launched a frantic attack on the Japanese working class and their trade unions, and recently dismissed a large number of progressive journalists and 2,137 electrical workers. This time they have dissolved the All-Japan Federation of Trade Union Liaison Council. This series of evil actions once again exposes the U.S. imperialist plot to turn Japan into a military base and colony, preparing to launch a new war of aggression, and at the same time fully demonstrates the power of the Japanese people's and Japanese working class's struggle, forcing the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to drop their masks and carry out open suppression.

However, the Japanese working class has not been deceived or intimidated by imperialism. The Japanese working class, with its revolutionary tradition, is determined to continue the struggle until complete victory is achieved.

The Chinese working class warmly sympathizes with the heroic struggle of the Japanese worker brothers and is determined to give full support, and calls on the entire Asian working class and the entire world working class to unanimously support the Japanese working class and demand that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries withdraw their illegal orders and restore the All-Japan Federation of Trade Union Liaison Council.

### 美日反动派非法解散全日工联　我全国总工会提出严重抗议  号召世界工人阶级声援日本工人兄弟

　　美日反动派非法解散全日工联
    我全国总工会提出严重抗议
    号召世界工人阶级声援日本工人兄弟
    【新华社七日讯】中华全国总工会对美、日反动派非法解散全日本工会联络协议会一事，特发表抗议书。该抗议书原文如下：
    八月三十日日本傀儡政府在美帝国主义在日本的侵略者并侵略朝鲜台湾的麦克阿瑟指使下，下令解散了全日本工会联络协议会，同时“整肃”了该工会干部十二人。消息传来，中国工人阶级无限愤怒，特提出严重的抗议。
    美、日反动派这一措施，完全违反波茨坦宣言和远东委员会的决定。波茨坦宣言明白规定要把日本引上民主化和非军国主义化的道路，远东委员会也决定“应允许职工会参加政治活动与支持政党”，“应鼓励工会参加日本民主化过程……诸如消灭军国主义与垄断资本的实施”。所以日本傀儡政府的这一行动，完全是非法的。
    自六月间美、日反动派非法“整肃”日本共产党中央委员以来，接着对日本工人阶级和他们的工会进行了疯狂的进攻，最近又大批解雇进步新闻工作者和二千一百三十七名电气职工，这次又解散了全日本工会联络协议会。这一连串的罪恶行动，再一次暴露了美帝国主义变日本为军事基地和殖民地，准备发动新侵略战争的阴谋，同时也充分表现了日本人民日本工人阶级斗争威力，迫使美、日反动派放下假面具而作公开的镇压了。
    但是，日本工人阶级并没有被帝国主义所欺骗和吓倒。有革命传统的日本工人阶级，决定继续坚持斗争，直到获得完全的胜利。
    中国工人阶级，热烈同情日本工人兄弟的英勇斗争，决以全力支持，并且号召全亚洲工人阶级，全世界工人阶级一致声援日本工人阶级，要美、日反动派撤消其非法命令，恢复全日本工会联络协议会。
