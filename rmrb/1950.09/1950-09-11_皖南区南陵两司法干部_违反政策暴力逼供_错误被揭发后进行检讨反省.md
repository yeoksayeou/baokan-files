Two Judicial Cadres in Nanling, Southern Anhui
Violently Extort Confessions in Violation of Policy
After Errors are Exposed, They Conduct Self-Criticism and Reflection

The actions of Zheng Shaonan, a trial judge of the Nanling County People's Court in Southern Anhui, in torturing prisoners by beating and suspending them, using corporal punishment to coerce confessions, and the actions of Dai Yue, a clerk, in arbitrarily releasing prisoners, constitute serious violations of policy.

Zheng Shaonan frequently used a lever as an instrument of torture when interrogating prisoners. In May of this year, after the Hecun District of Nanling County reported to the court the case of Luo Xiaogen of Jianxi Village murdering his wife, Zheng, together with Tian Zhongyu of the County Armed Forces Department, Zhou Lunhui of the District Youth Department, and Xu Ying, a cadre of the District Government, went to Jianxi Village to bring the head of the farmers' association group, the head of the natural village, the involved party Luo Xiaogen, and Xiaogen's younger sister in for interrogation. Zheng did not conduct any investigation or study of the case in advance, and immediately hung up the head of the farmers' association group and the head of the natural village. He also hung up Xiaogen's younger sister (for five minutes), forcing her to admit to incest with her brother. In reality, Luo Xiaogen's younger sister is sixteen years old this year, and there was no incestuous relationship between the siblings. The Southern Anhui District People's Court has handled this case separately based on the actual situation.

Dai Yue is a retained personnel member. Although he studied at cadre school for a period, his thinking is still backward and his style is atrocious. He insisted that Qiang Hua, a murderer and a corrupt and derelict official who committed heinous crimes, was behaving very well in prison and should not be sentenced to death. He also casually brought friends and relatives to see prisoners (he once brought his younger brother to see the special agent prisoner Wang once). The special agent Wang behaved poorly in prison, loafed during production, and organized small groups to attempt retaliation. The court sentenced Wang to three months' imprisonment, but Dai released him from prison before the term expired. In addition, Zheng Shaonan and Dai Yue also went to the homes of prisoners to drink wine, completely losing the position of a revolutionary judicial worker.

After Zheng Shaonan's errors were exposed, he went to Jianxi Village, Hecun District, on May 19th to hold a mass meeting and publicly conduct self-criticism, admitting his mistakes. Because Dai Yue did not frankly admit his mistakes, he is still conducting self-reflection at the County Public Security Bureau.

The Supreme People's Court attaches great importance to the illegal and undisciplined behavior of Zheng Shaonan and Dai Yue and has issued a circular, pointing out that there are serious shortcomings in the leadership of the Nanling County People's Court. The Southern Anhui District People's Court must conduct a comprehensive inspection of the work of the Nanling County People's Court to correct the erroneous thinking of cadres and improve work. Zheng Shaonan is also instructed to deeply reflect and conscientiously correct his mistakes in this rectification study. As for Dai Yue, who is currently conducting self-reflection at the County Public Security Bureau, casually bringing relatives and friends to visit prisons and privately releasing special agent prisoners are obviously illegal and undisciplined behaviors and should be given due punishment after the truth is clarified.

### 皖南区南陵两司法干部  违反政策暴力逼供  错误被揭发后进行检讨反省

　　皖南区南陵两司法干部
    违反政策暴力逼供
    错误被揭发后进行检讨反省
    皖南区南陵县人民法院审判员郑少南，在审讯时对犯人进行乱打乱吊，使用肉刑逼供；书记员戴月则随意释放人犯。这是严重违反政策的行为。
    郑少南在审讯犯人时，经常以杠子作刑具。今年五月间，南陵县合村区向法院报告了涧西村罗小根杀害其妻一案后，郑即会同县武装部田中玉、区青年部周伦慧、区政府干部许英等前往涧西村将农会小组长、自然村长、当事人罗小根及小根的妹妹传来审讯。郑事先对案情并未加以调查研究，即将农会小组长、自然村长吊起来；又将小根之妹吊起（五分钟），逼其承认兄妹通奸。实际上，罗小根之妹今年十六岁，兄妹间没有通奸情事。皖南区人民法院根据实情，已对此案另行处理。
    戴月系留用人员，虽在干校学习过一个时期，但思想仍很落后，作风恶劣，对罪大恶极之杀人犯及贪污渎职犯强华，硬说他在监内表现很好，不处以死刑；平时又随便带朋友和亲戚去看犯人（曾带其弟弟去看过特务犯汪某一次）。特务汪某在监内表现不好，生产偷懒，组织小团体企图报复。法院曾判处汪徒刑三个月，但未及期满戴即把他开释出监。此外，郑少南与戴月还到犯人家吃酒，完全失去了一个革命司法工作者的立场。
    郑少南之错误经揭发后，已于五月十九日到合村区涧西村召开群众大会，公开检讨，承认错误。戴月因不坦白承认错误，仍在该县公安局进行反省。
    最高人民法院对郑少南和戴月两人的犯法乱纪行为是极为重视的，发出了通报，指出：南陵县人民法院领导上存在着严重的缺点。皖南区人民法院必须对南陵县人民法院工作进行一次全面检查，以纠正干部的错误思想，改进工作。并责成郑少南在此次整风学习中深刻反省，认真改正错误。至于现在县公安局进行反省之戴月，随便带亲戚朋友到监所探看和私放特务犯，显系违法乱纪的行为，应在查明真象后，予以应得的处分。（本文系根据最高人民法院来件编写）
