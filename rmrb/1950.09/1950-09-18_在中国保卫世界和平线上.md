　　On the Chinese Line of Defending World Peace
　　The working comrades of the Jinzhou Railway Section's trains organized peace work groups. They used loudspeakers on the trains to publicize in detail to the masses and collect signatures, which was very effective. In less than two weeks, more than 12,000 folks signed. Their working spirit moved many people. Zhao Jingbo, a fellow villager from Qiqihar, wrote to them saying: "Due to the efforts of the peace workers and their detailed explanations, everyone understood the meaning of signing and signed their names, making a great contribution to peace."
　　In Longyao County, Hebei, 170,611 people have already signed the peace declaration, accounting for more than 70 percent of the county's population of 240,000. Zheng Baoqun, a farmer in Xiliang Village, said after hearing the propaganda about the peace signature campaign: "For the victory of the peace camp, we must step up production. This year I will plant three mu of cotton, and next year I will definitely plant five mu." Cao Laoti said: "I will press a few more carts of green manure and put it on the wheat fields to harvest more grain, to increase the strength of peace." After the peace signature campaign in Liandong Village, the entire village's public grain was delivered in full. Xie Qingchang said, "Paying public grain is a way of expressing our determination to defend peace."
　　Under the encouragement and publicity of the members of the Chongqing Minjian Association, a signature campaign was launched among the masses in the suburbs of Chongqing, and more than 50,000 signatures were collected in three days. In this work, it was originally stipulated that each working comrade should mobilize 1,000 people to sign, but after the inspection, the results showed that the following 19 people exceeded the basic task: Zeng Mengshi, Gan Wenliu, Huang Xueshen, Huang Xiangchao, Huang Shicong, Xu Chonglin, Wang Zhiren, Yan Baozhang, Li Jie, Liu Yiren, Yan Weicong, Gan Zhi, Fu Shirui, Zhou Xucheng, Mao Yike, Jiang Lihua, Huang Runhua, Luo Qianyuan, and Zhou Yuzhong.
　　The Suiyuan Province Peace Signature Campaign Committee held a "Peace Signature Data Exhibition" in the Guisui City Cultural Center on September 2nd. The two large rooms were filled with peace signatures from all ethnic groups, agencies, organizations, and people from all walks of life in the province. Thirty-eight long strips of silk in various colors of red, white, and yellow with signatures were hung in the exhibition room, along with more than one hundred peace signature books. The walls were covered with poems, cartoons, woodcuts, and a "Determination to Defend World Peace" written in Mongolian by the soldiers of the 10th Regiment of Mongolian Cavalry, all promoting the defense of world peace. These names signed in different languages ​​express the will of the people of all ethnic groups in Suiyuan to defend peace. As of September 1st, 520,000 people in Suiyuan Province had signed their names.
　　The Cang County District of Hebei Province launched a peace signature campaign. From August 18th to September 11th, within 25 days, 1.16 million people in the entire district signed the peace declaration, accounting for 50 percent of the district's total population. Zhang Jianquan, an old lady in her fifties, said angrily when she signed: "In 1938, Japanese devils burned 75 women in our village in one day. My hair was burned off, and I almost got burned to death. It still makes me angry when I think about it. The Japanese devils were finally driven away. Now this bad seed, the United States, is making trouble again. I will sign my name to oppose the American imperialists launching a war of aggression.
