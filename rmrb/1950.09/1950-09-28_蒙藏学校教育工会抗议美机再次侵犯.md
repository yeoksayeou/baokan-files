　　The Education Union of Mongolian and Tibetan Schools Protests U.S. Plane's Repeated Intrusion
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Committee of the Education Union of Mongolian and Tibetan Schools of the Chinese Education Union sent a letter to this newspaper, expressing its protest against the incident of U.S. planes intruding into our country's airspace again. The letter states:
    The shameless atrocity of U.S. imperialism, the sworn enemy of peace-loving people all over the world, intruding into our country's northeast airspace again, is a further bestial aggression against our country and an insult to the entire peace camp. Standing from the position of educators of minority nationalities, we call on educators of all minority nationalities across the country to work more actively, strive to consolidate the unity of all nationalities, resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's protest statement to the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council, and fight to eliminate the instigators of new wars of aggression and restore peace in the Far East and the world.

　　蒙藏学校教育工会抗议美机再次侵犯
    【本报讯】中国教育工会蒙藏学校委员会致函本报，对美机再次侵我领空的事件表示抗议。内称：
    全世界和平人民的死敌美帝国主义对我国东北领空再次侵犯的无耻暴行，是更进一步对我国进行兽性侵略，也是对全世界和平阵营的侮辱。我们站在少数民族教育工作者的立场上，号召全国少数民族教育工作者，更加积极工作，努力巩固各民族的团结，坚决拥护周外长致联合国大会及安理会的抗议声明，为消灭新侵略战争挑拨者及恢复远东和世界的和平而奋斗。
