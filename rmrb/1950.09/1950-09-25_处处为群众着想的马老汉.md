Old Man Ma, Who Always Thinks of the Masses

　　Leading the masses in production for self-salvation during the famine

　　Last year, Fengzhuang Village in Huairen County, Yanbei, suffered from flooding. Of the village's 2,840 mu of land, 1,187 mu were flooded. Twenty-two households that were most severely affected didn't even recover their seeds and would have nothing to eat in the fall. Many people felt helpless and wanted to sell their livestock and furniture to escape the famine. Ma Yiqian, the village branch secretary, felt that this was not the solution and explained to these households, "For farmers, losing livestock is like losing a hand. We can't sell our livestock, and we should raise money to buy more livestock for transportation. We can earn money with livestock to support our families." Everyone felt that this made sense, and those who were preparing to flee stayed. Following this, Ma Yiqian convened a meeting of Party members, Youth League members, and the masses to discuss ways to overcome the famine. The meeting decided that men would drive livestock and push wheelbarrows for transportation, while women would boil alkali, gather firewood, collect manure, and make large shoes, developing various sideline productions. Regarding the difficulties of transportation equipment and seed grain, it was decided to solve them through mutual assistance. After the meeting, the masses bought two cows, two horses, three mules, one and a half carts (sharing one with a neighboring village), and four wheelbarrows. They also put together three whole carts from broken ones. Together with the original seven large carts and seventeen wheelbarrows, the transportation work was carried out vigorously. During last winter's production, the whole village earned a total of 160 shi of rice.

　　Reformed Twenty-Two Opium Addicts

　　Fengzhuang Village had a total of twenty-five opium addicts. When organizing production last winter, Old Ma paid attention to reforming them. These people were mostly unwilling to work, and many people looked down on them. Old Ma adopted a combination of individual talks and family persuasion in reforming them, with great effect. As long as the opium addicts were willing to work, he would find ways to help them solve their difficulties. He first took out a dou of sorghum to solve the problem of food shortages for the opium addicts. He had a new leather coat, which he only wore for seven days last winter, and lent it to these people to wear while engaged in production for the rest of the time. If the opium addicts didn't have wheelbarrows, he would rent them on their behalf. Old Ma's exemplary actions influenced other Party members and the masses, and everyone actively helped the opium addicts reform. Those who had demonstrated a genuine determination to reform and had shown actual improvement were given a "graduation" ceremony after a mass meeting. This further encouraged the opium addicts' determination to quit opium and work. The blackboard newspaper also often praised those who had performed well and criticized those who had not changed. Under this patient and persuasive, curative approach, twenty-two of the twenty-five opium addicts in the village have been reformed.

　　Foresight in Building Flood Control Dams

　　Learning from the lessons of last year's flooding, he led the entire village in building flood control dams after this spring's sowing. Some people felt that it would not be too late to build the dams after weeding. He said, "If the dams are not built, even the land will be washed away. What good is weeding?" So men and women alike started working together, and in three days, they built a flood control dam eighteen zhang long, five chi high, and two zhang five chi wide at the base. In addition, they built a small dam thirty zhang long, repaired an old dam, and dug a canal. As soon as the project was completed, a major flood came, but none of the land in Fengzhuang Village was damaged, and 372 mu of land were silted up. The masses said with satisfaction, "If it weren't for Old Man Ma's foresight, we would have suffered a great disaster again this time. If Old Man Ma could take care of us for another ten years, all the dry land in the village would be turned into paddy fields. Life would be even better!"

　　In the spring, most cattle-raising households lacked grass for feed, and households without livestock could not afford to hire livestock. Old Ma organized households without livestock to dig white grass roots in exchange for cattle labor (one yoke of cattle plowing for one day in exchange for 190 jin of white grass roots). In this way, everyone's difficulties were solved. When the government purchased railway ties, Old Ma organized the masses to cut wood in a planned way. As a result, the village sold 227 railway ties, solving the difficulties of some disaster-stricken households. When planting trees, Old Ma seized this opportunity to explain the benefits of planting trees and mobilized widespread planting, emphasizing that whoever plants owns the trees. Due to his leadership, the village planted a total of 13,000 trees in the spring, exceeding the original tree-planting plan. Old Ma always thinks of the masses, so the methods he comes up with are most easily accepted by the masses, and his propaganda and mobilization are most persuasive.

　　Old Ma is fifty-five years old this year. From the age of eight, he tasted the bitterness of herding sheep and working as a hired laborer. Only in 1948, during the land reform, did he get land. He worked hard to cultivate crops, and his life has gradually improved. In the autumn of that year, he was elected chairman of the village representative meeting by the masses, and in October of last year, he became the village branch secretary.

　　Old but Vigorous, Actively Learning to Read

　　Old Ma did not go to school when he was young and was illiterate. He felt the difficulty of illiteracy in his work, so in recent years he has paid attention to learning to read. Now, although he cannot fully understand the official documents sent by the district, he can generally understand the main points. At the Chahar Province Model Worker Conference, he held a speech outline he wrote himself when reporting his model deeds. He felt that to lead the masses in their work, he should understand the policies and major events of the current situation, so that he could explain them to the masses and solicit their opinions at any time. He personally subscribed to a newspaper. Although Old Ma is old, his desire for progress is very urgent. At the provincial evaluation meeting, Old Ma's speech was very educational for everyone, but he felt that his past work was still very poor. He was happy that he had learned a lot of experience at the meeting. In his words, "I exchanged millet for a lot of steamed buns." He firmly stated that he would bring back the experiences of various places to improve the work in the village. At this meeting, Ma Yiqian was elected as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Heroes, Peasants and Soldiers.

### 处处为群众着想的马老汉

　　处处为群众着想的马老汉
    灾荒中领导群众生产自救
    去年，雁北怀仁县冯庄村遭了水灾。全村二千八百四十亩土地中，就有一千一百八十七亩被水淹了。受灾最重的二十二户，连种籽都没收回来，秋天就没的吃。很多人感到没法子办，要卖了牲口、家具，准备出外逃荒。村支部书记马义谦觉得这样做不是办法，就向这些户解释：“庄户人没了牲口，就像剁了手一样，养种也非丢了不可。咱们决不能卖牲口，还要凑钱多买牲口来跑运输。用牲口赚钱养活家口。”大家觉得这话有道理，准备逃荒的留下来了。跟着，马义谦就召开了党、团员和群众会议，讨论度荒的办法。会议议定：男人赶牲口、推小车搞运输；妇女们熬碱、打柴、拾粪、纳大鞋，开展各种副业生产。关于运输器材、垫本粮的困难，决定以互助办法解决。会后，群众就合股买了牛、马各两头，骡子三头，皮车一辆半（和外村合买一辆），小车四辆，又把破车凑成三辆整车。加上原有的七辆大车，十七辆小车，运输工作就热热闹闹地搞起来了。在去年冬天的生产中，全村共赚米一百六十市石。
    改造了二十二个烟民
    冯庄村共有二十五个烟民。去年冬天组织生产时，老马就注意了改造他们。这伙人大都不愿劳动，很多群众瞧不起他们。老马在改造他们时，采用了个别谈话和家属规劝相结合的办法，效果很大。只要烟民愿意劳动，有困难他就想办法帮助解决。他首先拿出一斗高粱，解决烟民的吃粮困难。他有一件新皮袄，去冬自己只穿过七天，其余时间都借给这些人穿上闹生产了。烟民没小车的，他就代为租赁。老马的模范行动，影响了其他党员和群众，大家都积极地帮助烟民改造。实际行动证明确实有改造决心和表现的，便开群众大会给他摘掉烟民的帽子。这样越发鼓励了烟民戒烟和劳动的决心。黑板报上也常常表扬表现好的，批评不转变的。在这种谆谆善诱，治病救人的方针下，该村二十五个烟民，已改造好二十二个。
    有预见，兴修防洪坝
    接受去年遭受水灾的教训，今春播种后，他就领导全村兴修防洪坝。有人觉得：锄完苗再修也不误事。他说：“坝修不起来，连地都冲了，锄了顶啥用？”于是男男女女一齐下手，三天挑起十八丈长、五尺高、二丈五尺底宽的防洪坝一道。此外，修了一道三十丈长的小坝，修补了一条旧坝，还开了一道水渠。工程刚结束，大水上来了，冯庄村的土地都没受害，还淤出来三百七十二亩地。群众满意地说：“要不是马老汉想得到，这回又要受大害了。马老汉如再能给咱们照料十年，村里的旱地都要变成水地。光景会过得更好了！”
    春天，养牛户多数缺喂草，没牲口户又雇不起牲口；老马就组织缺畜户刨白草根换牛工（一犋牛耕一天，换白草根一百九十斤）。这样大家的困难就都解决了。政府收买道木，老马就组织群众有计划的去伐木头。结果该村卖了二百二十七根道木，解决了一部灾户的困难。植树时，老马又抓住这个事实，说明栽树的好处，动员广泛栽植。强调：谁栽的归谁。由于他的领导，该村春季共植树一万三千棵，超过原订的植树计划。老马处处能替群众着想，所以他想出的办法，群众最易接受，他的宣传动员也最有说服力量。
    老马今年五十五岁了。他从八岁起，尝尽了放羊、当雇工等痛苦生活滋味。一九四八年土改时，才有了土地。养种庄稼很下功夫，光景已渐渐好过了。当年秋，他被群众选为村代表会主席，去年十月任村支部书记。
    老当益壮，积极学文化
    老马小时没念过书，大字不识，在工作中感到不识字的困难，于是这几年就很注意认字。现在区里发去的公文，他虽然不能完全认下来，但大意总能看出来了。这次在察哈尔省评选劳动模范会议上，他报告模范事迹时，还拿着自己写的发言提纲。他觉得自己要领导群众做工作，应该懂得政策和时局上的大事，好随时向群众解释和征求意见。他个人订了一份报纸。老马年纪虽老，求进步的心却很迫切。省的评选会上，老马的发言对大家教育意义很大，他却感到过去自己的工作做得还很差劲。他高兴自己在会上学到了很多经验。用他的话说是：“我用小米换到了很多馒头。”他坚决表示：要把各地的经验带回去改进村里的工作。在这次会上，马义谦被选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会代表。
