Wherever There is Difficulty, Wang Zhilin Appears
    --An Account of Wang Zhilin, the "Resourceful, Brave, and High-Altitude Hero" of the Railway Corps

The young Communist Party member Wang Zhilin performed extraordinary feats in the Railway Corps' emergency repair of the Yuehan Railway, earning the title of "Resourceful, Brave, and High-Altitude Hero." He has been selected as a representative of the Railway Corps to attend the National Model Worker Representative Conference.

(I) "This is a special situation," Wang Zhilin insisted on working in the water despite his illness

Under the heroic slogan of "Wherever the front extends, we will build the railway there," a part of the Railway Corps advanced to Yueyang City, on the edge of Dongting Lake along the Yuehan Line, on the dawn of July 27, 1949, just three days after its liberation. They undertook the arduous task of repairing dozens of large and small bridges on the Yuehan Line that had been destroyed by the Jiang-Bai bandits.

The sweltering heat of southern China added great difficulties to this emergency repair unit. In less than a month, more than 70% of the troops developed malaria. But the task was urgent, and the political consciousness and morale of the commanders and fighters were high. Under these conditions, the first arduous and fierce battle of emergency repair unfolded on the Puqi River. Wang Zhilin, a 19-year-old young Communist Party member, showed himself to be even more heroic and outstanding among the people struggling against difficulties.

At that time, Wang Zhilin was suffering from two illnesses - malaria and dysentery - but he insisted on working throughout. Every day he was in the water transporting wooden stakes and stones. He had too many bouts of diarrhea, and it was too troublesome to run ashore, so Wang Zhilin couldn't bear to waste the precious time and simply had diarrhea in the water. When the malaria became severe and his body could no longer support him, he would climb ashore and lie down for a while. As soon as the coldest spell passed, while his teeth were still chattering, he would jump back into the water to work.

The doctor advised him not to go into the water, but he wouldn't listen. His comrades advised him, but it didn't work either. His answer was "This is a special situation." The company commander was so anxious that he ran over and gave him an order:

"Wang Zhilin! I told you not to work, why are you still here?"

"Company commander! So many people in the whole company are sick. If everyone with a little illness didn't come, how many people would be working in this company? The task is so urgent and the situation is so special."

In this way, Wang Zhilin left the company commander speechless. To carry out the task, Wang Zhilin showed a high degree of selflessness.

(II) In the raging rapids, Wang Zhilin took the lead in transporting stones to reinforce the bridge piers

It had been raining for several days in a row, and the water in the Puqi River was rising sharply. The two bridge piers standing in the Puqi River were already half-submerged by the raging river, and it looked as if they were about to be washed away. The results of the hard work of the whole company for the past two months, despite their illnesses, would be completely wasted.

"Fill the bridge piers with stones to reinforce the foundation" - this was an urgent task assigned by the higher authorities to the Sixth Company. The raging river roared madly, and the waves crashing against the wooden bridge piers splashed water three or four feet high. No one knew how many fathoms deep the river was, and even those who could swim were not sure if they could avoid being swept away in the rapids. The rafts, filled with stones ready to fill the bridge piers, were already waving to the soldiers in the waves. Wang Zhilin and Zhao Yunzhi, two young people from the People's Liberation Army and good children of China, faced with a tense and dangerous environment, did not hesitate in the slightest. They jumped onto the raft, picked up two or three zhang long bamboo poles, and pushed the raft into the rapids. The raft sped in the rapids, and the people on the shore shouted and watched, both worried and excited.

The river rushed the raft toward the wooden bridge pier like an arrow. The alarming speed could cause the raft to suddenly hit the wooden bridge pier and smash it to pieces.

"Ah! Danger!" The people on the shore let out heart-stopping screams.

Wang Zhilin and Zhao Yunzhi, amidst the raging waves and splashing water, raised their bamboo poles and aimed at the broken cement pier remnants exposed on the surface of the water near the wooden bridge pier. Like skilled knights maneuvering unruly steeds, the two poles landed on the cement pier, and in an instant, the raft was stopped and gently leaned against the wooden bridge pier, successfully dumping the stones. Under the leading influence of Wang Zhilin and Zhao Yunzhi, raft after raft filled with stones, following Wang Zhilin's path, were pushed into the water by the rising heroes, passed through the turbulent rapids, and sent near the wooden bridge piers, successfully completing the bridge pier reinforcement project.

(III) Resourceful, brave, and daring to climb high

The news of victories at the front was increasing, and the task of bridge repair was becoming more urgent, and Wang Zhilin's deeds were becoming even more amazing.

In the project of repairing the Xinyanxia Bridge, the Sixth Company was mainly responsible for erecting a three-layer scaffolding. Before erecting the scaffolding, two "human" shaped poles were first erected at both ends of the bridge. On top of the two "human" shaped poles, a sky cable made of a seven-fen thick steel cable three or four hundred meters long was installed, hanging high above the entire 180-meter-long bridge. A pulley was attached to the sky cable, and then a steel cable was passed through the pulley to hang the scaffolding to be hoisted. By cranking the winch to shorten the steel cable, the more than 1,000-jin scaffolding could be hoisted up. The speed at which this task was completed would directly affect the completion date. Comrade Wang Zhilin once again demonstrated the noble qualities of a Communist Party member here. He always worked in the highest and most dangerous places, and insisted on staying at the site for two days and nights.

Before hoisting the first scaffolding on the third layer, in order to prevent the scaffolding from shaking, the steel cable was first tied to the middle of the scaffolding, and then the steel cable and the top beam of the scaffolding were tied together with three strands of iron wire. Then, the winch was used to shorten the steel cable in order to hoist the scaffolding. When the top beam of the scaffolding had just been hoisted over the second layer of scaffolding, it was blocked by a string of pulleys attached to the sky cable. If the three strands of iron wire were not untied to allow the scaffolding to deviate to the outside of the pulleys, there was no way to hoist the scaffolding up. However, to untie the three strands of iron wire, one had to climb onto the scaffolding suspended in mid-air, 28 meters above the ground. Moreover, after untying the iron wire, the scaffolding would inevitably shake violently. If one was not careful, the person untying the iron wire would fall to the ground from a high place. The comrades stared blankly at the 28-meter-high scaffolding. The iron wire could not be untied, and the scaffolding could not be hoisted. The 2,000-kilogram scaffolding was hanging high in mid-air, and the situation was serious and dangerous. The company commander's voice became hoarse with anxiety, and he issued several appeals:

"Who will go up and untie it?"

Jin Chaofu first mustered the courage to climb to the top of the third-layer scaffolding. He looked down and saw the gloomy river valley, the broken piers and beams lying horizontally and vertically, and the water flowing like a thin ribbon. If the iron wire was untied and the scaffolding tilted, throwing a person down, let alone surviving, even the bones would be shattered. After struggling with his thoughts, he still climbed down.

The difficulty was clearly in front of them, and if the iron wire was not cut, the problem could not be solved at any time.

"Who can volunteer to go up and try again?" The company commander asked again in a questioning tone.

Comrade Wang Zhilin had already climbed up from the bottom layer when Jin Chaofu came down. Although he was also a little scared at this time, he had a firm belief: "Only by completing the task in the most difficult and most difficult environment can one be considered a true Communist Party member."

Inspired by a strong spirit of revolutionary heroism, Wang Zhilin resolutely cut off the three strands of wire with a knife, quickly completing the task. The comrades below were all sweating for his daring climb, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief until he cut the iron wire and there was no danger. From then on, the name "Wang Zhilin" spread throughout the entire brigade, and he was awarded the glorious title of "Resourceful, Brave, and High-Altitude Hero" at the company's military conference.

### 那里有困难王志林出现在那里——记铁道兵团“机智勇敢登高英雄”王志林

　　那里有困难王志林出现在那里
    ——记铁道兵团“机智勇敢登高英雄”王志林
    年青的共产党员王志林，在铁道兵团抢修粤汉路的工程中立过特功，获得“机智勇敢登高英雄”的称号。这次当选为铁道兵团出席全国劳模代表会议的代表。
  （一）“这是特殊情况”，王志林带病坚持下水工作
    在“前方打到那里，我们就把铁道修到那里”的英雄口号下，铁道兵团的一部分于一九四九年七月二十七日拂晓，进到了粤汉线上洞庭湖边甫告解放三天的岳阳城，担负起抢修粤汉线上被蒋白匪破坏的数十座大小桥梁的艰巨任务。
    江南的酷暑，给这支抢修部队增加了很大的困难。不到一个月，部队中就有百分之七十以上的人员发生疟疾。但任务是紧急的，指战员们的政治觉悟和情绪也是高涨的，就在这样的条件下，在蒲圻河上，展开了第一场艰苦而激烈的抢修战斗。十九岁的青年共产党员王志林，在向困难作斗争的人群中，显示了他更英勇而突出。
    当时，王志林身上正带着两种病——疟疾和痢疾，但他始终坚持着工作，每天都在水里运桩木，运石子。拉痢的次数太多，跑到岸上太麻烦，王志林舍不得宝贵的时间，他干脆在水中拉痢；赶上疟疾发到厉害的时候，身子再也支持不下去时，他就爬到岸上躺一会，等最冷的一阵刚过去，牙关还上下打战的时候，他却又跳下水工作去。
    医生劝阻他不要下水，他不听。同志们劝告他，也不顶事。他的回答是“这是特殊情况”。急得连长跑过来下命令了：
    “王志林！叫你不要来工作，为什么还来？”
    “连长！全连病号这样多，若是有点病都不来，这连能有几个人工作？任务是这样紧迫，情况又这样特殊。”
    就这样，王志林把连长说得也没法了。为了执行任务，王志林表现出高度的忘我精神。
  （二）在奔腾叫啸的急流中，王志林带头运石加固桥基
    一连下了好几天雨，蒲圻河里的水，一个劲的猛涨，耸立在蒲圻河中两座桥墩，已被汹涌的河水吞没了一半，眼看就要被水冲歪。全连两个月来带病辛勤工作的成绩，就会完全废于一旦。
    “往桥墩填石头，加固桥基”——这上级布置给六连的一个紧急任务。奔腾的河水在疯狂的叫啸着，冲激到木桥墩上的波浪溅起了三、四尺高的水花。这河水到底有几丈深，没有人知道，即使会水的人，插身在这急流中，能否不被卷没，也是很没有把握的事情。装满了准备填桥墩石头的木筏，已经在波涛中一上一下的向战士们招手了。王志林，赵运志，这两个人民解放军中的青年，中华人民的好儿女，面对着紧张而危险的环境中，没有丝毫的犹豫，他俩跳上了木筏，拿起两三丈长的竹篙，把木筏撑到急流中去，木筏在急流中飞奔，岸上的人们一个个又担心又兴奋的喊着、望着。
    河水把木筏像射箭似的冲向木桥墩去，惊人的速度，会使木筏猛然的碰向木桥墩，撞得粉碎。
    “嗳呀！危险！”岸上的人们发出了惊心动魄的叫嚣。
    王志林和赵运志，在惊涛骇浪和水花飞溅中，举起竹竿，对准木桥墩附近露出水面残破的洋灰墩垛，像熟练的骑士操纵着难驭的烈马似的，两根竿子落在洋灰垛上，刹那间，木筏被止住了，轻轻的靠到木桥墩上，顺利地把石头倒下去。在王志林和赵运志的带头影响下，一个个堆满石块的筏子，照着王志林的道路，被后起的勇士们撑在水中，通过波涛汹涌的急流，送到木桥墩附近去了。胜利完成了桥墩加固工程。
  （三）机智勇敢，冒险登高，
    前方大捷的消息越来越多，修桥的任务也就越来越紧，王志林的事迹也越来越惊人。
    在修新岩下桥的工程中，以六连为主立三层排架。在未立排架之前，首先要在桥的两头立上两个“人”字形的拔竿，在两个“人”字形的拔竿的顶上，按上一根七分粗三、四百米长的钢绳作成的通天绳，高高地横悬在一百八十多米长的整个桥梁的上空，在通天绳上拴上活滑车，再用一根钢绳穿过活滑车挂住要吊起的排架，用卷扬机把钢绳越摇越短，就可以把一千多斤的排架吊立起来。这个任务完成得快慢，将直接影响竣工期的迟早。王志林同志在这里又一次表现了他的共产党员的高贵品质，他总是登在最高处最危险的地方工作，坚持两昼夜没下现场。
    在吊起第三层的头一个排架前，为了怕排架摇晃，首先将钢绳绑住排架的中腰，再用三股铁丝把钢绳和排架的顶梁绑在一起，然后用卷扬机把钢绳绞短，才能把排架吊立起来。排架的顶梁刚吊过了二层排架时，就被拴在通天绳下的一串滑车挡住，如果不把三股铁丝解开，让排架偏到滑车外面，那是怎么也不能把排架吊起来的。可是，要解开三股铁丝，必须爬到悬在半空中的离地面二十八米高的排架上去，而且把铁丝解开以后，排架一定要猛烈地摇晃起来，一不小心，解铁丝的人就要从高处摔到地上。同志们望着二十八米高的排架干瞪眼，铁丝解不下，排架又吊不起来。二千多公斤的排架吊在高高的半空，情况又严重又危险，大队长嗓子都急哑了，几次的发出号召：
    “谁上去解开？”
    金朝福首先鼓足了勇气爬到三层排架顶上，俯身一看，阴沉的河谷，横躺竖卧的残垛破梁，水流如一条细带，如将铁丝拆开，排架一倾斜，把人摔下去，别说活命，连骨头都得摔碎，思想斗争了一气，结果还是爬下来了。
    困难是很明显地摆在前面，不把铁丝拆断，问题到何时也解决不了。
    “谁能自报奋勇的再上去试一下呢？”大队长又发出带疑问的口气。
    王志林同志早在金朝福下来时，就从最下层爬上去了。他这时虽然心里也有些害怕，可是他有一个坚定不移的信念：“只有在最恶劣，最困难的环境下完成了任务，才算是个真正的共产党员。”
    一种强烈的革命英雄主义的精神鼓舞着他，王志林毅然决然的把三股丝用刀砍断，迅速完成了任务。在下面的同志都为他冒险登高捏了一把汗，直到他把铁丝砍断，没出危险，大家才松了口气。从此以后，“王志林”这个名字就传遍了全大队，在中队军人大会上送给他“机智勇敢登高英雄”的光荣称号。
