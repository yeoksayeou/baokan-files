Chinese and Indian residents living in the city also participated in the signature campaign.

In late July, a conference to support world peace was held in northern Vietnam. Attendees included members of the National Assembly of Vietnam, representatives of people's organizations and public institutions, democratic figures, representatives of Chinese and Indian residents, and members of the Lao People's Liberation Committee, totaling over 10,000 people. Signatures for the Peace Appeal were collected at the conference.

To welcome the upcoming Vietnam Peace Committee meeting, the Preparatory Committee of the Vietnam Peace Committee recently issued a statement, calling on the Vietnamese people to widely launch a peace signature campaign.

Xinhua News Agency, September 15th. The movement to sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal is unfolding across Burma. According to a report in the Yangon People's Daily, as of August 1st, the Burmese branch of the World Peace Congress had collected 250,000 signatures in Yangon city alone. The total number of signatures in Burma has exceeded 1.5 million. In late July, an average of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 signatures were sent to the Burmese branch of the World Peace Congress every day.

The peace signature campaign has been enthusiastically responded to by people from all walks of life in Burma. Professors from Yangon University, as well as figures from the press and theater, have signed the Peace Appeal. A significant number of members of parliament and government civil servants have also signed. Overseas Chinese organizations and schools have actively participated in the peace signature movement.

August 6th marked the fifth anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Japan, by the United States.

As a result, in Bahan Township alone, over a hundred monks and nuns in various temples signed the Peace Appeal, supporting the resolution against war and the prohibition of atomic bombs.
