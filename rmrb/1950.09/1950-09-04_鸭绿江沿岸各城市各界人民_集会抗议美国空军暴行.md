(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang) The crimes of US aircraft invading China's airspace and strafing Chinese people have aroused great anger among the people along the Yalu River.

        Andong
    Workers, farmers, and women in Andong City and its suburbs have held rallies for days to protest the provocative and brutal acts of the US Air Force in invading China's airspace, and expressed their firm will to oppose aggression and defend peace.

    More than 500 employees of the tussah silk textile factory held a forum. Worker Liu Jinzhan said: "The American planes that strafed our airport flew over our heads, we saw it very clearly, the United States cannot deny it; the American planes killed and injured our worker brothers, we must demand this blood debt."

    All the workers of the Andong Paper Mill also held a forum. The workers all believe that the crime of the US aircraft's killing of Chinese people must be punished according to the method proposed by Foreign Minister Zhou.

    Many factory workers have expressed their intention to step up production to support the People's Liberation Army in consolidating national defense and preparing to give the invaders a double blow.

    Farmers in six streets in the suburbs of Andong City, including Linjiang, Yanwo, Zhenzhu, Xinhua, Tianping, and Jingshan, held protest rallies separately. Wang Xixiang, a farmer from Yanwo Street, said at the protest rally: "When the American plane came on the 27th, I was weeding in the sorghum field. I saw it very clearly. We must all remember this blood debt in our hearts." Another farmer, Deng Wenliang, said: "The way the United States is doing things, we all oppose it, men, women, old and young. In the past, the Japanese oppressed us, and today the Americans also want to learn from the Japanese. But now the Chinese people already have their own country, and now is not the time for anyone to bully us as they please. The Americans have made a wrong calculation, we must teach them a lesson." Wang Qiguang said: "I saw with my own eyes the American planes flying over the Yalu River, and I heard the sound of strafing with my own ears. The American planes shot and killed our worker brothers, this is bloody evidence. We farmers are not afraid of American imperialism. This time the United States' atrocity has only deepened our hatred for it."

    Women in the urban area of Andong City have also held rallies to discuss ways to deal with the American aggressors. Ji Chehua, a woman from Sanma Road, said: "We women must encourage our husbands and sons to step up production, work hard, and strengthen the power to defend the country." Jiao, an old army dependent woman from Caishenmiao Street, said: "My son is still at the front, I want to write to him and tell him to fight well, drive the American troops out of Taiwan, and avenge our compatriots!"

    In addition, more than 1,000 cadres of the Andong Municipal People's Government and all the students of the municipal primary school teacher training class also held rallies to protest the atrocities of the US aircraft. At the protest rally of the municipal government cadres, Mayor Chen Beichen called on all cadres to raise their vigilance, unite all the people, and make full preparations to crush the US imperialism's aggressive plot to expand the war.

        Linjiang
    The Linjiang County Trade Union Member Representative Conference held in Linjiang City on September 1st, representing more than 26,000 workers in mines, factories, timber, forests, railways, etc. in the county, issued a protest against the US aircraft atrocities. The protest stated: We all representatives have personally seen the various crimes caused by the US aircraft at Linjiang Station. We absolutely cannot tolerate this aggressive act of American imperialism. We resolutely support Foreign Minister Zhou's statement, and will support the People's Liberation Army with more diligent production, preparing to strike the aggressors.

    On the same day, more than 2,500 representatives from factories, government agencies, mass organizations, and schools in Linjiang City gathered from all over the city to the Linjiang Theater in pouring autumn rain to hold a conference. Representatives from all walks of life unanimously pointed out in their speeches that the blood debt of our suffering compatriots must be demanded from American imperialism. The conference finally adopted a written statement supporting Foreign Minister Zhou's statement and requesting the Security Council to sanction the aggressive acts of American imperialism.

        Ji'an
