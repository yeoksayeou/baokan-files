Zhang Fugui is a household name in Shandong. He is from Fugui Village in Wendeng County, Jiaodong. He has been continuously elected as a labor hero of the village, district, county, and province since 1942. This time, he was recommended as a representative to attend the National Congress of Labor Model Representatives of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers.

I. Zhang Fugui's Mutual Aid Team

“Organizing” is the central link in agricultural production, and Zhang Fugui fully understands this. When the democratic government called for organizing to participate in production in 1943, Zhang Fugui was the first to respond. He immediately organized five "inter-plowing" groups in the village, and created a new organizational method of developing from a mother group to daughter groups. Initially, due to lack of organizational experience, a group collapsed several times a year. Later, he accumulated experience, reorganized the organization, and sent out active members in the group to lead new groups. Therefore, Zhang Fugui's group was called the mother group, and the others were called daughter groups. Under the promotion of Zhang Fugui's group, all 83 households in the village have now been organized into 15 mutual aid groups.

Zhang Fugui's group is organized according to the voluntary principle of free entry and free exit. After spring planting, wheat harvest, and autumn harvest each year, the mutual aid group is reorganized once, democratic discussions are held in the group, and various systems and production plans are established. Everyone resolutely implements the resolutions passed through democratic discussion to ensure the completion of the production plan. More importantly, Zhang Fugui's group promptly promoted and improved the enthusiasm for labor, and promptly checked and summarized the advantages and disadvantages in labor to seek improvement and enhancement. In addition to intensive cultivation and improvement of production technology, the yield has increased year by year, and the production mood of the masses has also continued to rise, greatly improving the lives of the entire village.

II. Intensive Cultivation, Improving Technology

Zhang Fugui pays great attention to intensive cultivation. His land is deeply plowed to a depth of eight or nine inches, and it is plowed again after plowing. He often says, "Plowing the land every year can resist drought and prevent waterlogging." Before planting wheat in the fall, he always plows it once, spreads manure, and then plows it again. He said: This is not only easy to catch seedlings; but also can prevent wild wheat. According to Zhang Fugui's personal experience, crops become better with each weeding. He said, "Wheat weeded three times fills a peck with kernels." His principle is to weed more. Wheat, beans, peanuts, etc., are generally weeded two or three times, and tall crops such as corn, millet, and sorghum are generally weeded seven to nine times.

Zhang Fugui knew the importance of technological improvement for agricultural production, so he was very willing to accept scientific knowledge and technical guidance. In the winter before last year, the higher authorities called for winter plowing, but the masses there had no winter plowing habits, and it was not easy to promote. Under the guidance of the county farm, Zhang Fugui selected nine minutes of land to conduct experiments on varieties, fertilization, and cultivation methods; and divided them into three types: intensive cultivation, non-intensive cultivation, and rough cultivation, with three minutes of land for each type. Corn was planted in the spring, but the harvest in the fall varied: 94 catties for intensive cultivation, 83 catties for non-intensive cultivation, and 66 catties for rough cultivation. Therefore, during winter plowing last year, the entire village and nearby areas not only plowed more, but also plowed deeply and carefully. Zhang Fugui is very serious about fertilization and seed selection when planting. He often said, "Planting large buds is rough. Without selecting good seeds and applying more fertilizer, you can't harvest more grain!" During the winter slack season, he launched fertilizer accumulation work, and came up with many fertilizer accumulation methods, such as composting manure, composting green manure, artificial urine...etc. After successful experiments, he promoted and introduced them to the outside. He also worked hard to promote cultivation methods and improved varieties. He promoted the entire village to compare Shengli No. 100 sweet potatoes with foreign sweet potatoes, climbing green beans with ordinary beans, and flat ridges of peanuts with large ridges, in order to obtain practical results so that the masses would adopt improved varieties. Zhang Fugui often said: "Listening to the higher authorities and believing in scientific methods will never be wrong." Therefore, he always accepted scientific guidance first in production technology, and then created new methods from practical work; and achieved very good results.

III. Amazing Production Achievements

In 1944, the production achievement of the whole village was plowing five years and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain (耕五余一), and Zhang Fugui achieved plowing three years and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain (耕三余一). In 1945, the whole village achieved plowing three years and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain, and Zhang Fugui achieved plowing two years and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain (耕二余一). In 1946, the whole village achieved plowing two years and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain, and Zhang Fugui achieved plowing one year and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain (耕一余一). In 1947, due to Chiang Kai-shek's bandits attacking Jiaodong, the people enthusiastically supported the front, and under the extreme lack of labor, the whole village still had a good harvest. Not only did it guarantee the payment of public grain to support the war, Zhang Fugui still achieved plowing one year and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain. In 1948, in addition to supporting the front, the whole village had a surplus of 20,000 catties of grain, and Zhang Fugui achieved plowing one year and having a surplus of two years' worth of grain (耕一余二). In 1949, under the attacks of various disasters such as wind, hail, drought, insects, floods, and spring famine, except for a few people in the village who lacked grain, the rest were self-sufficient. Zhang Fugui still maintained the amazing achievement of plowing one year and having a surplus of two years' worth of grain.

This year, the production of the whole village has taken a further step, and all kinds of crops have had a bumper harvest. All of Zhang Fugui's crops this year are improved varieties. According to the experience of the farmers in the village over the years, it is estimated that Zhang Fugui can harvest 13,000 catties of grain this year, which will exceed his land-level yield (3,592 catties) by more than three times.

IV. Poor Village Becomes Rich Village

Fugui Village was originally named Wanghaisui Village. In 1946, after the whole village achieved plowing two years and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain, and Zhang Fugui achieved plowing one year and having a surplus of one year's worth of grain, the farmers in the village clearly realized that Zhang Fugui was their role model. Therefore, in 1947, with the approval of the People's Government, the masses changed the name of this impoverished village, Wanghaisui Village, to "Fugui Village", and the village's textile cooperative was also renamed "Fugui Cooperative".

Before liberation, out of the 67 households in Fugui Village, 20 households ate at the village mess hall; more than 40 households struggled to make a living; many single men could never afford to marry a wife. Zhang Fugui was still watching cattle for others at that time. Since the Communist Party established a democratic government here in 1940 and implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, land reform, and production movements, every farmer's family has had land to cultivate. After several years of hard work, the whole village now has 1,003 mu of land. Zhang Fugui has also become a middle peasant with more than 24 mu of land and a family of six. The current Fugui Village is a new sight. Many farmers are planning to build new houses and walls after the autumn harvest, and every family is raising pigs and sheep. All school-age children in the village are attending school; almost all young women have learned to write letters; the village has also organized two communication groups, which often write articles for newspapers; under the leadership of the Youth League, young people gather in the club every night and are very active. Recently, statistics show that there are already 49 couples who have married freely in the village; 27 single men have married wives. The whole village is full of an atmosphere of harmony, friendship, and mutual assistance, and everyone is working for a better and prosperous life. (Attached picture)

　　富贵村的张富贵
    提起张富贵在山东是家喻户晓的，他是胶东文登县富贵村的人；他是从一九四二年起连续当选为村、区、县、省劳动英雄，这次又被推选为出席全国工农兵劳模代表会议的代表。
  一、张富贵的互助组
    “组织起来”是农业生产的中心环节，张富贵充分领会了这一点。当一九四三年民主政府号召组织起来参加生产时，张富贵首先响应，他在村里马上组织了五家搿犋小组；并创造了由母组发展到子组的新的组织办法。最初因为没有组织经验，一个小组一年垮了好几次，后来他积累了经验，重新整理组织，把组里积极分子分出去领导新组，因此张富贵组被称为母组，其他的被称为子组。在张富贵组的推动下，现在全村八十三户，已全部组织起来，共有十五个互助组。
    张富贵小组是采取自由入组、自由出组的自愿原则组织的。在每年春种后、麦收后、秋收后，互助组都要重新整理一次，在组里展开民主讨论，建立各种制度和生产计划。凡经过民主讨论的决议，大家坚决执行，以保证生产计划的完成。更主要的是张富贵的小组里及时发扬和提高了劳动的积极性，并及时检查总结劳动中的优缺点，以求改进和提高；再加以精耕细作和生产技术的改良，因此产量年年提高，群众生产情绪也不断上涨，大大的改善了全村的生活。
  二、精耕细作、改良技术
    张富贵很讲究精耕细作。他的地都是深刨到八、九寸深，而且都是刨后再耕一遍，他常说：“地年年刨，可以抗旱防涝”。秋天种麦前他总是先刨一遍，铺上粪后，再耕一遍，他说：这样不但易于捉苗；而且还可以防乌麦。照张富贵亲身的体验，庄稼多锄一遍有一遍的成色。他说：“麦锄三遍面充斗”。他的原则就是多锄，小麦、豆子、花生等一般锄二、三遍，苞米、谷子、高粱等高杆作物一般的锄七到九遍。
    张富贵他知道技术改良对于农业生产的重要性，所以他很愿意接受科学知识和技术指导。前年冬季，上级号召冬耕，但那里的群众都没有冬耕习惯，不易推动。张富贵就在县农场指导下选择了九分地，作品种、施肥、耕作法等试验；并分为深耕细作、不深不细的耕、粗耕三种，每种三分地，春季种上苞米，但到秋天收获量则各有差别：精耕细作者是九十四斤，不深不细者是八十三斤，粗耕者是六十六斤。因此在去年冬耕中全村及附近都不仅多耕而且都深耕细作起来。张富贵在种地上，对施肥、选种也顶认真。他常说：“种大芽子粗，不选好种不多施肥就不能多打粮！”冬季农闲时他就展开积肥工作，并且想出很多积肥方法，如沤粪、沤绿肥、人造尿……等试验成功后又向外推广介绍。对耕作方法和优良品种的推广也很努力，他推动全村把胜利百号地瓜与洋地瓜作对比，爬蔓青豆子与一般豆子作对比，花生平垅与大垅作对比，以求得实际效果，使群众都采用优良品种。张富贵常说：“听上级的话，相信科学方法，决不会有差”。所以他在生产技术上事事首先接受科学指导，然后从实际工作中创造了新的办法；并且获得了很好的成绩。
  三、惊人的生产成绩
    一九四四年全村生产成绩是耕五余一（耕五年可余一年粮食），张富贵作到耕三余一。一九四五年全村耕三余一，张富贵耕二余一。一九四六年全村耕二余一，张富贵耕一余一。一九四七年因蒋匪进攻胶东，人民踊跃支前，在劳力极端缺乏的情形下，全村收获仍然很好，不但保证了缴足公粮支援了战争，张富贵仍做到耕一余一。一九四八年全村除支前外，还余粮二万斤，张富贵做到耕一余二。一九四九年因风、雹、旱、虫、涝、春荒等各种灾害袭击之下，全村只有少数缺粮外，余皆可自给自足，张富贵仍保持了耕一余二的惊人成绩。
    今年全村生产比过去更进一步，样样庄稼都是丰收。张富贵今年的庄稼全部种的是优良品种。村里农民按照历年经验估计，张富贵今年能收一万三千斤粮，将超过他的地级产量（三千五百九十二斤）三倍以上。
  四、穷村从此变成富村
    富贵村原名望海随家村，一九四六年因全村生产达到耕二余一的成绩，张富贵达到耕一余一后，使该村农民清楚的认识到了张富贵就是自己的榜样，因此在一九四七年经人民政府的批准，群众就把这个贫困象征的望海随家村名，改为“富贵村”，村里的纺织社也改名“富贵社”。
    富贵村在翻身前，全村六十七户有二十户是村饭的；四十几个是抗活度日；很多单身汉，永远娶不起老婆，张富贵那时也还在为人看牛。自从一九四○年共产党在这里建立民主政府，实行减租减息、土地改革、生产运动后，农民家家都有了地种，经过几年的努力生产，现全村有地一千零三亩。张富贵也变成了二十四亩多地六口之家的中农了。现在的富贵村已是一片新的气象。不少农民正打算在秋后盖新房子、建筑墙垣，家家都在添养猪羊，全村学龄儿童没有一个不上学的；青年妇女们几乎全都学会了写信；村里还组织两个通讯组，经常给报纸写稿；青年们在青年团的领导下，每晚凑在俱乐部里非常活跃，最近统计全村已有四十九对男女自由结婚；二十七个单身汉娶了老婆。全村充满着和睦、友爱、互助的气氛，大家为着更美好的富裕生活而劳动着。（附图片）
