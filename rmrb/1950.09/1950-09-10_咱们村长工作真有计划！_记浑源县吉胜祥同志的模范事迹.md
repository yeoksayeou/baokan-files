　　"Our Village Chief Really Plans His Work!"
    Record of Comrade Ji Shengxiang's Exemplary Deeds in Hunyuan County

    Comrade Ji Shengxiang (a member of the Chinese Communist Party) is from Xinpei Village, Third District, Hunyuan County, Chahar Province, and is thirty-five years old this year. From 1937 to 1939, he served as a platoon leader in the army, and later returned home due to injuries. He has been the village chief of Xinpei Village since 1947.

    The village has a total of 4,042 mu of cultivated land and 23 head of draught animals. Before the spring ploughing this year, he considered: "Twenty-three head of draught animals can only plow about 100 mu of land a day, and it will take 25 days to plow 2,500 mu. If we want to plant early, what about the remaining 1,500 mu?" After discussion with village representatives, the village branch, and village cadres, it was decided to organize the masses and implement mutual aid in production. Under the vigorous publicity of the representatives and the lead of party members and cadres, the masses realized the benefits of work exchange and mutual assistance. On the principle of free association, they organized 23 groups of people pulling plows (a total of 113 people participated) to carry out a vigorous campaign, solving the difficulty of insufficient animal power and completing the plowing and sowing work on time.

    At the county production conference, he learned the seed soaking technology. At that time, he thought: "This is a crucial key to increasing production this year, but the masses did not have this habit before. How can we get the masses to accept it?" Therefore, he took the lead in soaking his own three mu of oat seeds, and conducted soaking and germination experiments at various meetings to allow the masses and cadres to learn. For some people who did not believe in seed soaking and were afraid of scalding the seeds to death, he adopted the method of individual conversations, patiently explaining the principles and dispelling their concerns. He also personally soaked four shi and one dou of oat seeds for the masses who were afraid to soak the seeds. As a result, seed soaking was promoted throughout the village. More than 95% of the village's 898 mu of oats were soaked. Later, when planting millet, the masses automatically soaked the seeds. According to the inspection results, only 1.5% of the oats in the village developed mildew after soaking (in previous years, up to 20% of the village's oats were affected by mildew). The masses had even greater confidence in seed soaking.

    In terms of flood prevention and silt deposition, he held meetings with the villages concerned, promoted the spirit of mutual assistance, consultation, unity and friendship, and signed a water use contract that was beneficial to both parties. He opened eight large and small canals, which can irrigate more than 3,000 mu of land, turning most of the dry land into paddy fields. When neighboring villages Xifangcheng and Jiancun opened canals, they occupied land from their village and agreed to offset the price with grain. However, due to the difficult living conditions of the people in the two villages, part of the grain had not been paid off. Some people in Xinpei Village advocated demanding it forcefully, but he explained the principles of mutual assistance to the masses very well, and the masses agreed to wait until after the autumn harvest. On April 8th (lunar calendar), he went to the city for business and heard that Wang Qianzhuang and other villages in the Fifth District had been washed away by floods. The next day, he hurried back to the village and convened a meeting of village representatives, mobilizing more than 270 people in the village (including 10 women) to spend two days repairing more than 300 zhang of the village's flood control dam, which had been in disrepair for three years. Finally, the village was spared from the flood when heavy rain fell and mountain floods broke out on the third night. Therefore, the masses liked to say, "Our village chief really plans his work."

    This year, some of the village's land was hit by hailstorms. In order to organize the masses to save themselves through production, he mobilized a large number of women and children to collect wild vegetables through the Women's Federation (a total of 143 large urns of wild vegetables were collected in 20 days, which is expected to save 572 dou of coarse grains). Because the Soviet alfalfa seeds lent by the government had not been planted before, the masses were unwilling to plant them. He publicized and explained this to the masses, explaining that it could improve the soil and feed the livestock. He first tried planting half a mu himself, and all the seedlings emerged in less than ten days. The masses believed him, and everyone planted more than 60 mu.

    In early August, the summer oats matured and grew very well. In view of the fact that field selection of seeds had not been carried out well last year, he took the initiative to lead the masses to select 14 shi of oat seeds without waiting for instructions from higher authorities.

    In short, he is an active and enthusiastic good village chief. He has been the village chief for four consecutive terms and has won the support and trust of the masses. He said to people: "If I do a day's work, I must be responsible for a day and do my best."

　　“咱们村长工作真有计划！”
    记浑源县吉胜祥同志的模范事迹
    吉胜祥同志（中共党员）是察哈尔省浑源县三区新裴村人，今年三十五岁。一九三七年至一九三九年，他在部队里担任排长的职务，后因负伤回家。从一九四七年到现在，他连任新裴村村长。
    该村耕地共四千零四十二亩，共有耕畜二十三犋。今年春耕开始前，他就考虑：“二十三犋耕畜每天只能耕地一百亩左右，二十五天才能耕二千五百亩。要想提前种好，其余一千五百多亩怎么办？”经过他和村代表、村支部、村干部们开会研究，决定组织群众，实行生产互助。在代表们的极力宣传和党员干部们的带头下，群众认识到拨工互助的好处，在自由结合的原则下，组织起人拉犁二十三犋（共有一百一十三人参加），大力突击，解决了畜力缺乏的困难，按时完成了耕播工作。
    在县生产会上，他学会了浸种技术。当时他就想：“这是今年增产的重要关键，但群众以前没有这个习惯，怎么才能使群众接受呢？”于是，他首先带头把自己三亩莜麦种浸了，并在各种会议上作了浸种和发芽试验，让群众和干部学习。对一些不相信浸种、怕烫死种子的人，他采用了个别谈话的方式，耐心地讲清道理，解除了他们的顾虑。并且亲自给不敢浸种的群众浸了四石一斗莜麦种子。于是，浸种工作便在全村推广了。全村八百九十八亩莜麦，百分之九十五以上浸了种。后来在种谷子的时候，群众就自动浸种了。据检查结果，今年莜麦浸种后发生霉疸的只占百分之一点五（往年全村莜麦霉疸者达百分之二十）。群众对浸种就更信任了。
    在防洪放淤工作方面，他曾和有关各村开了会，发扬了互助协商、团结友爱的精神，订立了对双方有利的使水合同，开了大小渠八道，可灌溉土地三千多亩，使大部旱地变成水地。邻村西坊城、涧村开渠时占了他们村的地，说定折粮付价。但因两村群众生活困难，有部分粮未还清。新裴村有些群众主张硬要，他就很好地向群众解释互助的道理，群众都同意等到秋收后再要。四月八日（阴历），他因事进城，听到五区王千庄等村被水冲坏，次日即赶忙回村去，召开了村代表会，动员村里群众二百七十多人（内有妇女十人），用二天时间，把三年来失修的护村防洪大坝，补修好了三百多丈，终于使该村在第三日晚上暴雨骤降、山洪大发时避免了水灾。因此，群众喜欢地说：“咱们村长工作真有计划。”
    今年村里有一部分地遭了雹灾，他为了组织群众生产自救，就通过妇联发动大批妇女儿童采集野菜（二十天中共采集野菜一百四十三大瓮，预计能节省粗粮五百七十二斗）。政府贷下的苏联苜蓿种子，因为过去没有种过，群众不愿意种。他就向群众进行宣传解释，说明这能改良土壤，喂养牲口，自己并先试种半亩，结果不到十日全部出苗。群众相信了，大家种了六十多亩。
    八月初，夏莜麦成熟了，长得很好。他鉴于去年没有很好进行田间选种，今年未等上级布置，就主动地领导群众选了十四石莜麦种。
    总之，他是一个积极、热情的好村长。他连任村长四年，获得群众拥护信任。他对人说：“我干一天工作，就要负一天责，尽十分心。”
