The Chinese Youth Art Theatre's decision to stage "How the Steel Was Tempered" has two purposes:

First, to introduce Chinese youth to the path of struggle of Soviet youth; to show how the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League matured and grew stronger; and how Soviet youth league members became the Party's reserve force.

Second, we should learn from the Soviet Union to further massify the Chinese New Democratic Youth League based on the experience of the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League, to enable our league members to raise their political awareness, and to enable our Party members to possess noble revolutionary qualities—like Pavel Korchagin.

Most of this generation of Chinese youth have experienced Pavel's encounters. They have been whipped by imperialists, they have been imprisoned by the Kuomintang, countless sisters and friends have encountered fates like Horishinas, and thousands upon thousands of Walienas have died among Chinese youth. They participated in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan. Now, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are generating and continuing to generate thousands upon thousands of Zhu Herais to temper our tens of millions of youths into steel. If Chinese youth have all experienced Pavel Korchagin's circumstances, undergone the same tests, endured the same hardships, shed the same tears, and engaged in roughly the same struggles with the same revolutionary sentiments, then why can't thousands upon thousands of Pavel Korchagins emerge among Chinese youth?

Of course, becoming a Pavel Korchagin is not an easy task. Charging into battle for our banner and remaining steadfast in the face of the enemy's knives are relatively less difficult. The most difficult thing is, like Pavel Korchagin, to never think of oneself before life ends, but only to think of work, the Party, the people, and the proletarian cause, and to resolutely struggle to the end. This is truly commendable and valuable.

We believe that many Pavel Korchagins have emerged in our revolutionary struggle, but unfortunately, in the past, in such severe and difficult struggle environments, we were not allowed to discover and record them one by one. What a pity! Therefore, our performance of Pavel Korchagin this time has one last hope, which is to bring the spirit of Pavel Korchagin to our Chinese audience and youth. At the same time, we hope that our audience, who are emotionally communicating with the stage, if they still remember or know a person like Pavel Korchagin in their minds, they should write it down and record it, so that we can have "Pavel Korchagins" on our Chinese stage who have been tempered from the struggle of our Chinese youth.

　　演出保尔·柯察金的意义
    廖承志
    中国青年艺术剧院这次决定演出《钢铁是怎样炼成的》，其目的有二：
    第一，向中国青年介绍苏联青年是经过怎样一个奋斗路途的；苏联列宁共产主义青年团是经过怎样一个途径成熟与壮大起来的；苏联青年团员是怎样成为党的后备军的。
    第二，我们应该向苏联学习，使中国新民主主义青年团根据苏联列宁共产主义青年团的经验更进一步的群众化，使我们的团员都能提高他们的政治觉悟，使我们的党员都能具有高尚的革命品质——如保尔·柯察金一样。
    我们中国这一代的青年，大部分都经历过保尔的遭遇，他们挨过帝国主义者的皮鞭子，他们坐过国民党的牢，他们无数姐妹与朋友曾遭遇过何丽丝娜一样的命运，中国青年当中曾产生过千千万万娃莲那样的死，他们参加过八年的抗日战争，现在我们在毛主席的领导下，正产生和继续在产生着千千万万个朱赫莱，来把我们几千万个青年都锻炼成钢铁一样。如果中国的青年都是经历过保尔·柯察金的境遇，经过和他相同的考验，经过和他相同的苦难，也流过和他相同的眼泪，并且在同样的革命情感上作过大致相同的奋斗的话，那么为什么中国青年当中，不能出现千千万万个保尔·柯察金？
    当然作一个保尔·柯察金不是件容易的事情；为着我们的旗帜去冲锋陷阵，在敌人的屠刀面前坚忍不屈，这些都是比较不太困难，最困难的是像保尔·柯察金一样，在生命一分钟未停止以前，就从不想到自己，只是思念着工作，思念着党，思念着人们，思念着无产阶级事业，坚决奋斗到底，这才是真正难能可贵的。
    我们相信在我们革命的斗争中，也产生过不少保尔·柯察金，只可惜在过去那样严重与困难的斗争环境中没有允许我们一个个去发觉与记载下来，这是多么可惜的事！因此我们这次演出保尔·柯察金，还有一点最后希望，就是把保尔·柯察金的精神带给我们中国的观众与青年，同时也希望与舞台上感情交流的我们的观众，如果他们脑子里还记得或者还知道保尔·柯察金那样人物，应该把他写下来和记下来，让我们中国舞台上面，也有我们中国青年从斗争中锻炼出来的“保尔·柯察金”。
