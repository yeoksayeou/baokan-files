　　Jilin Chemical Plant Corrects Tendency of Isolated Document Study
    Combines Inspection and Improvement Work
    [This newspaper's Jilin dispatch] After the rectification movement at the state-owned Jilin Chemical Plant corrected the tendency of studying documents in isolation, without integrating with actual work, it was decided to focus the rectification and inspection work on checking product quality, sales, and basic construction projects. It was also stipulated that document study should be combined with work inspection, learning what is being rectified.

    On August 4th, the plant organized an inspection team, led by the plant director, to inspect the brick kiln. It was discovered that the mud had too much water and was too diluted, the produced bricks were easily deformed, and the fired bricks were porous, not strong, not resistant to pressure, and did not meet specifications; the quality was too poor. Among the 160 workers, 70 workers had an average waste product rate of 20%, causing serious waste of state property. The main reason for this loss was the plant leadership's serious bureaucratic work style. Due to the leadership's eagerness for quick results, pursuing quantity and neglecting quality, and after accepting an urgent order from Shenyang, 40% of the more than 300 workers recruited by the plant were not brick makers. In addition, the inspection system was a mere formality, resulting in poor product quality. There were also defects in the wage system; regardless of grade or quality, the price was the same, which encouraged workers to make bricks only for quantity and not quality, with the good emulating the bad. From the brickyard management personnel to the workers, there was a bad habit of not paying attention to quality, but the leadership did not persuade or educate them to correct it in time.

    These phenomena have been appropriately addressed after the above inspection. Non-brick making workers were streamlined after persuasion and mobilization. The remaining workers were strengthened in their education on the importance of quality to enhance their sense of production responsibility. At the same time, ten workers who consistently made good bricks were rewarded to encourage all workers to strive to improve quality. The work of the two top brick makers was also set as the standard for future quality improvement. In addition, inspection systems and reward and punishment measures were established. An inspection team was organized on-site. After this inspection, work efficiency began to improve, and there is now a significant improvement in quality.

　　吉林化工厂纠正孤立学习文件倾向
    检查和改进工作结合
    【本报吉林讯】国营吉林化工厂整风运动纠正了孤立学文件不与实际工作结合的偏向后，确定以检查产品质量、推销、基本建设工程作为整风检查工作的重点，并规定文件学习和工作检查相结合，整什么学什么。
    八月四日，该厂以厂长为主组织了有关人员的检查组，进行对砖窑的检查。发现泥和的水分多而稀，制出的坯子容易变形，烧成的砖质地疏松，不坚固、不抗压、不合规格，质量太坏。在一百六十名工人中，就有七十名工人的产品废品率平均在百分之二十，使国家财产遭受严重浪费。造成此种损失的主要原因，是厂的领导上存在着严重的官僚主义作风。由于领导上存在急于求成，追求数量，忽视质量的思想，在接受沈阳一批紧急订货后，该厂招来的三百多名工人中，有百分之四十的非制坯工人，加之检查制度流于形式，致使产品品质低劣。在工资制度上也有缺陷，不分等级，质量好坏一样作价，这就鼓励了工人作砖只图数量不管质量的现象，好的向坏的看齐。从砖场管理人员到工人，都存在有不重视质量的恶劣习惯，但领导上也没有加以说服、教育，使之及时纠正。
    这些现象经过以上检查，现已进行了适当的处理。对非制坯工人经过说服动员实行精简；对留下来的工人，加强其重视质量的教育，提高其生产责任心；同时并奖励了一贯制好坯的十名工人，以鼓励全体工人为提高质量而努力，并将两名头等制坯工人作的活，作为今后改进质量的标准。此外规定了检查制度和奖惩办法。在现场组织了检查小组。经过这次检查后，工作效率开始好转，现在质量有着显著的提高。
