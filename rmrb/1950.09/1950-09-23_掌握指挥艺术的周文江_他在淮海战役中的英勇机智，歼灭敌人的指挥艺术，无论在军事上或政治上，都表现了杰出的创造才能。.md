Zhou Wenjiang Masters the Art of Command
    His bravery and resourcefulness in the Huaihai Campaign, his art of commanding to annihilate the enemy, demonstrated outstanding creative talent in both military and political aspects.
    Zhou Wenjiang is an excellent political instructor and an excellent military commander. He had glorious battle achievements in the War of Liberation. In the Rugao Campaign in Central Jiangsu in September 1945, he was the first hero to break through the west gate of Rugao; in the same year, he was a shock troop leader in attacking Xinghua and later besieging Yanzhou. In the Yudong Campaign in 1948, he single-handedly extinguished an enemy firepower bunker, removing the threat to the assault troops, when storming into the enemy’s District Shounian Corps headquarters in Longwangdian. In the same year, in the Zhuxiaozhuang battle of the Huaihai Campaign, he led thirty-seven soldiers to annihilate two enemy battalions. In the Yaowan battle of the same campaign, where the enemy’s 63rd Corps was annihilated, and in the final battle to annihilate Du Yuming's bandit troops, he twice broke into the enemy ranks and captured more than 540 enemy soldiers. In the Crossing-the-Yangtze Campaign in 1949, he was one of the commanders of the heroic company that broke through the river defense and was the first to land on Yangzhong Island.
    His bravery and resourcefulness in the Huaihai Campaign, his art of commanding to annihilate the enemy, and his rapid transformation of newly liberated soldiers through front-line political work, are sufficient to demonstrate his outstanding creative talent in both military and political work.
    In November 1948, the great Huaihai Campaign kicked off. On the evening of November 11, Zhou Wenjiang led two squads into the Yaowan breakthrough, and immediately surrounded a courtyard, which appeared to contain at least an enemy company. He estimated that the enemy must be panicking and wavering after our army broke through their position, so he began to shout at them. The enemy wanted the People's Liberation Army to send someone to negotiate with them. Zhou Wenjiang thought: If we ask them to send someone out, they will see that we only have two squads, and things will be difficult. He immediately arranged the firepower and took a communication soldier to crawl into the courtyard through a hole in the wall.
    Suddenly, an enemy heavy machine gun opened fire again, bullets flying straight at the heads of our soldiers guarding outside. Immediately after that, there was a gunshot from a civilian-made gun, and the heavy machine gun stopped firing immediately. It turned out that Zhou Wenjiang was quick-witted and shot the machine gunner to death. Then he ordered the enemy to lay down their arms. The enemy's deputy commander wanted to bribe Zhou Wenjiang with gold bars and watches, but he was sternly rejected. He took the opportunity to explain the People's Liberation Army's policy on prisoners of war to the enemy. As a result, more than two hundred and seventy enemies laid down their weapons and became prisoners.
    After the Yaowan battle, the Fifth Company was replenished with more than fifty newly liberated soldiers at once, while there were only twenty-odd veteran soldiers in total. With the help of the battalion, Zhou Wenjiang first improved the branch organization, and then mobilized everyone among the Communist Party members and veteran soldiers to unite the new soldiers. Everyone came up with many ideas.
    After the new soldiers came to the company, welcome meetings and introductions were held on the first day. The veteran soldiers talked about their own experiences, which was equivalent to giving everyone a political lesson. The veteran soldiers asked the new soldiers how they became soldiers in the Kuomintang army. Some new soldiers cried on the spot and began to accuse the reactionaries of their crimes. After the mobilization and help of the veteran soldiers, small-scale grievance meetings were held in the squads and platoons. The new soldiers poured out their grievances, ignited the fire of revenge, and many revealed hidden histories, positions, ages, and names, turned in their documents, and vowed to be loyal to the revolution.
    During the march, the veteran soldiers helped the new soldiers carry things. Whenever there was free time, Zhou Wenjiang used the fact that the soldiers who joined the army in the liberated areas were given land and turned over a new leaf as an example to educate the new soldiers. Zhou Wenjiang also held a solemn gun-awarding ceremony for the new soldiers, telling them the origin of these weapons and asking the new soldiers to cherish revolutionary weapons and fight the enemy fiercely, which further increased the enthusiasm of the new soldiers. Three days after the Yaowan battle, the troops marched west rapidly, marching seventy or eighty miles in one night. No new soldiers deserted or fell behind, and the singing was loud and morale was very high along the way. On the sixth day—November 18, the company participated in the blocking battle of Langshan and Shuangshan. In this fierce battle, more than ten new liberated soldiers of the Fifth Company were killed or wounded, but none of them performed poorly.
    Due to this outstanding front-line political work of "capturing, replenishing, teaching, and fighting immediately," the Fifth Company led by Zhou Wenjiang, although it suffered a total of one hundred and eleven casualties in the bloody battle of Huaihai, it had one hundred and sixteen people by the end of the campaign, and their morale was high and their fighting spirit was high. It won the honorary title of "First-Class Meritorious Company of the Huaihai Campaign."
    On January 9, 1949, on the eve of the final annihilation of Du Yuming's bandit troops, Zhou Wenjiang was ordered to lead his troops to seize the group of blockhouses in the northeast corner of Zhuxiaozhuang, in order to open up Zhuxiaozhuang, which was stubbornly defended by Du's bandits, the next day. At that time, the Fifth Company had only thirty-seven people in total. They advanced stubbornly along the trenches, and the enemy resisted every step of the way. The bunkers on the edge of the trenches were blown up one by one. When there were no more grenades, the soldiers found them from the enemy's corpses to throw; when the machine guns broke down, they found machine guns from the piles of enemy corpses to fight, changing one after another. Finally, all five hundred meters of trenches and more than twenty large and small bunkers were captured. The two enemy battalions defending this group of blockhouses were almost completely wiped out, while the thirty-seven people of the Fifth Company did not lose a single one, only two more wounded who refused to leave the front line.
    When Du Yuming's bandit troops were finally annihilated, Zhou Wenjiang led a squad into the chaotic enemy ranks at night to capture prisoners. The soldiers got separated along the way, leaving only him and a combat team. In the darkness, he found an enemy deputy commander leading a team, so he went up and ordered the enemy to surrender. The enemy deputy commander saw that there were only a few of them, so he pretended to order his troops to assemble, and suddenly turned around and grabbed Zhou Wenjiang's gun, and the two fought for it. The enemy's guards took the opportunity to shoot Zhou Wenjiang with a civilian-made gun, but it missed. Zhou Wenjiang immediately let go and jumped into a ditch next to him. Coincidentally, there was an enemy machine gun abandoned in the ditch. He picked it up and fired, scattering the enemy in panic, and the deputy commander disappeared. Under Zhou Wenjiang's machine gun, more than two hundred enemies surrendered obediently.

　　掌握指挥艺术的周文江
    他在淮海战役中的英勇机智，歼灭敌人的指挥艺术，无论在军事上或政治上，都表现了杰出的创造才能。
    周文江是一位优秀的政治指导员，又是一位优秀的军事指挥员。在解放战争中，他有着辉煌的战功。一九四五年九月苏中如皋战役，他是突上如皋西城的第一名英雄；同年攻打兴化和后来围困兖州，他都是冲锋陷阵的突击班长。一九四八年豫东战役，打进敌人区寿年兵团司令部驻地龙王店，他是只身扑灭敌人一座火力堡，解除冲锋部队所受威胁的功臣。同年，淮海战役朱小庄战斗，他率领三十七名战士歼敌两个营，在同一战役歼灭匪六十三军的窑湾战斗，和最后聚歼杜聿明匪部的战斗中，他曾两次突入敌阵，俘虏敌人五百四十多名。一九四九年渡江战役中，他是突破江防，最先登陆扬中的英雄连队的指挥员之一。
    他在淮海战役中的英勇机智，歼灭敌人的指挥艺术，和迅速改造新解放战士的火线政治工作，尤足以说明他无论在军事工作上或政治工作上，都具有杰出的创造才能。
    一九四八年十一月，伟大的淮海战役揭幕了。十一月十一日晚上，周文江带了两个班进入窑湾突破口，随即围住了一个院子，看样子里面至少有敌人一个连。他估计敌人在阵地已被我军突破的情况下，一定很恐慌动摇，于是就喊起话来。敌人要解放军去一个人和他们接洽。周文江想：要是叫他们派人出来，给看到我们只有两个班，事情就不好办。他马上布置好火力，带了一个通讯员从墙洞里钻进院子去。
    突然，敌人一挺重机枪又开火了，子弹直向守在外面的我军战士们头上飞来，紧接着一声卜壳枪响，重机枪立刻不响了。原来周文江眼明手快，一枪就把机枪手打死了。接着他就命令敌人缴枪。敌人的副团长想拿金条和手表来贿赂周文江，被他严峻地拒绝了。他并乘机向敌人解释了人民解放军的俘虏政策。于是二百七十多个敌人放下了武器，做了俘虏。
    窑湾战斗以后，五连一次就补充了五十多个新解放战士，老战士却一共只有二十多个人。周文江在营的帮助下，首先健全了支部组织，又在共产党员和老战士中间动员大家团结新战士。大家想了很多办法。
    新战士来到连队以后，第一天就开欢迎会、介绍会，老战士谈自己的身世，就等于给大家上了一堂政治课。老战士问新战士怎么给国民党军当兵的，有的新战士当场就哭起来，开始控诉反动派的罪恶，经过老战士们的动员和帮助，在班排里开展了小型的诉苦会。新战士们倒出苦水，燃起复仇的怒火，许多人说出隐瞒的历史、职务、年岁、姓名，缴出证件，发誓效忠革命。
    在行军中，老战士帮新战士背东西。一有空，周文江就以解放区参军战士分田翻身的事实作为例子，来对新战士进行教育。周文江又给新战士举行庄严的授枪仪式，告诉他们这些武器的来历，要新战士们爱护革命武器，狠狠的打敌人，这就使新战士的积极性更加提高了。窑湾战斗以后第三天，部队向西疾进，一晚行军七、八十里，新战士没有逃亡也没有掉队，而且一路上歌声嘹亮，士气非常高。到第六天——十一月十八日，该连就参加了狼山、双山阻击战。在这场恶战中，五连的新解放战士伤亡了十多个人，但没有一个表现不好的。
    由于这种卓越的“即俘、即补、即教、即打”的火线政治工作，周文江所领导的五连，虽然在淮海血战中共伤亡了一百十一人，但到战役结束时，它却有一百十六人，而且情绪高涨，斗志昂扬，荣获了“淮海战役一等功臣连”的光荣称号。
    一九四九年一月九日，最后聚歼杜聿明匪部的前夜，周文江奉命率部队夺取朱小庄东北角集团地堡群，以便第二天打开杜匪死守的朱小庄。五连当时全连一共只有三十七个人。他们沿着战壕顽强前进，敌人节节抵抗。壕边上的地堡一个个的都被炸掉了。没有了手榴弹，战士们就从敌人尸体上找来打；机枪打坏了，从敌人尸首堆里翻出机枪来打，换了一挺又一挺。最后，五百米战壕，二十多个大小地堡，全部占领了。据守这个集团地堡的敌人两个营，伤亡殆尽，而五连三十七个人，却一个也没少，只多了两个轻伤不下火线的伤员。
    杜聿明匪部最后覆灭的时候，周文江夜里又带一个班插到混乱的敌人中间去捉俘虏，中途战士们掉了队，只剩下他和一个战斗小组。黑暗中他发现敌人一个副团长，带着一支队伍在走，他就上去命令敌人投降。敌人副团长见他们只有几个人，就一面假装命令自己部队集合，突然回头抓住周文江的枪，两人争夺起来。敌人的卫兵乘机用卜壳枪打周文江，可是没有打中。周文江马上一松手，跳进旁边一条沟里。恰巧沟里有敌人遗弃的一挺机枪，他拣起来就打，打得敌人乱窜，那个副团长也不知去向了。在周文江的机枪口下，两百多个敌人驯服地做了俘虏。
