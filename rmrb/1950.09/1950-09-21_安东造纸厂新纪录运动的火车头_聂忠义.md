　　Nie Zhongyi - The Locomotive of the New Record Movement at Andong Paper Mill
　　Song Leshan
　　Before last October, the Andong Paper Mill had not completed its production tasks for a single month. At that time, the main problems were a shortage of raw materials and a lack of coordination between work types and processes, which frequently resulted in work stoppages due to waiting for materials, thus affecting production. Since Nie Zhongyi, a worker in the wood pulping room (one of the main workshops of the paper mill, for cooking raw materials), created a new record, he promoted the upper and lower processes. In November, the production task was exceeded, and in December, more than one-fifth of the annual production task was completed. In two months, a total of 14.4 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) was reduced in costs. Of this, Nie Zhongyi's two new records alone saved the state 1.5794 billion yuan. In 1950, the paper mill increased its production tasks. If the 1949 production is taken as 100, the 1950 target was raised to 224.7, exceeding the first half of the year's production plan by 18.5. These achievements are inseparable from Nie Zhongyi's record-breaking.
　　Nie Zhongyi is 34 years old this year. After setting a new record last November, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China.
　　At the beginning of the new record movement, in order to widely launch this movement, the Andong Paper Mill first rewarded the employees who had contributed in the past. Cui Shunli, a worker in the wood pulping room, also received an award. Old Nie thought to himself: "Why can't I get an award? As long as I work hard, the Communist Party will not bury talent." From then on, Old Nie put his efforts into it. He was constantly thinking about one question - how to shorten the cooking time?
　　November 3, 1949 - this was the happiest day for Old Nie, and also the happiest day for all the employees of the paper mill. On this day, Old Nie created a new record by shortening the fixed quota for cooking a pot of material (hard material) from 18 hours and 30 minutes to 12 hours and 4 minutes.
　　The appearance of Old Nie's new record first ensured the supply of raw materials for the entire factory. It broke the conservative thinking of some cadres and some workers, encouraged the workers' confidence in breaking records, and opened up a broad road for the Andong Paper Mill to carry out the new record movement. From then on, the papermaking workers no longer said, "We can't create new records without materials." The materials were already "more than sufficient." This promoted the papermaking machines to also set new records. The wood pulping room shortened the cooking time, and the number of times the pot was discharged increased. The production of liquid medicine in the calcination furnace saw a phenomenon of "supply falling short of demand." This prompted the workers in the calcination furnace to propose rationalization proposals, improve equipment and operating methods, and greatly increase the production of liquid medicine. Under the influence of Old Nie's achievements, a high tide of record-breaking competitions was set off throughout the factory.
　　However, Old Nie was not complacent because of this. He gave full play to the unparalleled wisdom of the working class. When celebrating the 70th birthday of Marshal Stalin in December, under the call of the Party and the trade union, he also improved the working methods for cooking soft materials. The cooking time was shortened from 19 hours and 30 minutes in the past to 11 hours and 45 minutes, creating a new record for the second time. Therefore, the technical quota of the paper mill for decades was broken, which greatly surprised the technicians and the old technical workers of twenty years, and they all praised it.
　　After Old Nie created a new record, he was not only rewarded by the factory and loved by all the employees, and his salary and benefits were improved, and he was promoted from a worker to a foreman; but also respected by the government, the higher-level trade union and the city's employees. He participated in the Provincial People's Representative Conference and received awards and certificates from the Provincial Government; he was also elected as a member of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; and in March of this year, he received a prize flag and bonus from the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government.
　　"Old Nie is different from before!" This is the unanimous praise of the workers.
　　Indeed, Old Nie is different from before. In the past, he only knew how to watch the pot, and didn't care about anything else, and kept things in his heart. Now he often says apologetically: "What is it to create this record? The people treat us like this, we must study hard and do more for the people." The fact is that since he became a foreman, he has become more modest in learning, uniting with his fellow workers, and in addition to actively working and actively learning, he also takes time to actively help others learn, especially in teaching apprentices. Since creating a new record, he has trained two technical workers who can master the cooking of materials, and seven are currently continuing to be trained. Old Nie said: "In a short period of time, I will definitely train them to be as skilled as myself."

　　安东造纸厂新纪录运动的火车头——聂忠义
    宋乐山
    去年十月前，安东造纸厂没有一个月完成了生产任务。当时的情况主要的是原料不足，工种、工序之间互相不衔接，经常发生停工待料的现象，以致影响了生产。自从木釜室（造纸厂主要车间之一，蒸煮原料）工人聂忠义创造新纪录后，推动了上下工序，十一月份就超过生产任务，十二月份竟完成全年生产任务的五分之一强；两个月来共降低成本一百四十四亿元（东北币，下同），其中只以聂忠义所创的两次新纪录来说，就给国家节省十五亿七千九百四十多万元。一九五○年造纸厂增加了生产任务，如以一九四九年生产为一百，一九五○年提高为二百二十四点七强，超过上半年的生产计划十八点五。这些成绩和聂忠义的创纪录是分不开的。
    聂忠义今年三十四岁，去年十一月创新纪录后，光荣的参加了中国共产党。
    创新纪录运动开始的时候，安东造纸厂为了广泛的展开这一运动，首先奖励了过去有功的职工，木釜室工友崔顺利也得了奖，老聂心想：“为什么咱就得不到奖呢？只要自己努力，共产党是不会埋没人材的。”从此以后，老聂就用上了劲，他每时每刻都在考虑一个问题——如何缩短蒸煮时间？
    一九四九年十一月三日——这是老聂最高兴的日子，也是造纸厂全体职工最高兴的日子，就在这一天，老聂创造了由十八小时零三十分蒸煮一锅料子（硬料子）的定额，缩短为十二小时零四分的新纪录。
    老聂的新纪录出现了，首先就保证了全厂原料的供给。打破了某些干部与部分工人的保守思想，鼓舞了职工创纪录的信心，给安东造纸厂开展新纪录运动开辟了广阔的道路。从此，抄纸工友不再说“没有料子不能创新纪录”了。料子已是“供过于求”。这样就推动了抄纸机也都创了新纪录。木釜缩短了蒸煮时间，出锅的次数增加，焙烧炉的药液生产，发生了“供不应求”的现象，这样就推动了焙烧炉工友提出合理化建议，改进了设备与操作方法，大大的提高了药液生产量。在老聂这一成就的影响下，掀起了全厂创纪录竞赛高潮。
    但是老聂并不因此而自满，他发挥了工人阶级无比的智慧，在十二月庆祝斯大林大元帅七十寿辰的时候，在党和工会的号召下，又改进了蒸煮软料子的工作方法，蒸煮时间由过去十九小时三十分，缩短为十一小时四十五分，二次创造新纪录。因而打破了造纸厂几十年来的技术定额，使技师和二十年的老技术工人也大大的吃惊，一致赞扬。
    老聂创造新纪录后，不只是受到本厂的奖励与全体职工的爱戴，提高了工薪待遇，由工人提拔为工长；而且受到政府与上级工会及全市职工的尊敬，他参加过省人民代表会议，得到省府的奖励和奖状；又被选为市总工会的委员；今年三月又得到了东北人民政府工业部赠给他的奖旗和奖金。
    “老聂和从前不一样了！”这是工友们的一致的称赞。
    的确，老聂和从前不一样了。过去他只知道看锅，别的什么也不管，有事搁在心里。现在他经常很抱歉的说：“创造这个纪录算个啥，人民这样对待咱，一定要好好学习，替人民多做点事情。”事实是这样，他自从当了工长，更加虚心学习，团结工友，除了积极工作，积极学习外，他还抽空子积极的帮助别人学习，特别在教徒弟方面，自创新纪录到现在，他已培养出两名能掌握蒸煮料子的技术工人，有七名现正在继续培养中。老聂说：“在短期间内，一定把他们也培养成和自己的技术一样。”
