　　Hebei Leting County People's Government
    Examines Bureaucracy in its Work

    [Reported by this newspaper] The People's Government of Leting County, Hebei Province, convened a meeting of cadres above the section chief level on August 12 to conduct a preliminary review of the government's work. It was found that bureaucracy existed in many aspects. (1) The leadership lacked thorough planning for work, was unfamiliar with the overall situation of the county, and did not conduct investigations or research, but instead was busy with routine administrative tasks all day long. Leading comrades were content with partial achievements and rarely considered comprehensive and major issues. There was a lack of specific guidance and assistance to subordinates. Work arrangements, instructions, and notices were numerous, but there was never any examination of the effectiveness of their implementation. According to statistics, in April alone, six departments issued as many as 33 instructions and notices, and in May, 49. The result of indiscriminately issuing instructions and notices was that lower-level cadres did not pay attention to them. After lower-level organs received instructions or notices, the common phenomena were "hanging them on the wall," "locking them in filing cabinets," and "discarding them randomly." (2) The phenomenon of reporting only good news and not bad news was very serious. Lower-level organs often made false reports to some extent. For example, regarding the figures for cotton planting in Panggezhuang in the old tenth district, the matter was investigated four times, but it has still not been clarified. Because of a lack of investigation and research in normal times and a lack of a regular statistical work system, many figures were only rough estimates. (3) The leadership was unfamiliar with the situation of cadres, only demanding that cadres complete tasks, but rarely conducted education and specific guidance. The leadership adopted an irresponsible attitude of pushing problematic cadres away, causing dissatisfaction among cadres with the leadership. After the reorganization, some district heads went home and refused to work, but the leadership did not deal with the matter in a timely manner. Because the leadership simply forced tasks, lower-level cadres resorted to coercion and commandism in their work, even resorting to beating and detaining people. All of this was the evil consequence of a bureaucratic leadership style.

### 河北乐亭县政府  从工作中检查官僚主义

　　河北乐亭县政府
    从工作中检查官僚主义
    【本报讯】河北省乐亭县人民政府，于八月十二日召开了科长以上的干部会议，对政府工作初步进行了检查，发现在许多方面存在着官僚主义。（一）领导上对工作没有周密的计划，对全县情况不熟悉，也不调查研究，终日忙于事务工作。领导同志只满足于局部成绩，很少考虑全面的较重大的问题。对下级缺乏具体指导与帮助。工作布置多、指示多、通知多，但从来没有检查执行的效果。据统计，四月份仅六个部门发出的指示和通知即达三十三件之多，五月份发出四十九件。滥发指示、通知的结果，使下级干部不重视它们。当下级机关接到指示或通知后，普遍出现上大挂（贴到墙上）、压禁闭（锁到文件箱里）、乱扔等现象。（二）报喜不报忧的现象很严重。下级机关往往做某种程度的假报告。例如关于旧十区庞各庄种棉数字，追查了四次，到现在还未搞清楚。因平时缺乏调查研究，缺乏经常的统计工作制度，有很多数字，都是大概估计的数字。（三）领导上对干部情况不熟悉，只要求干部完成任务，但很少进行教育和具体领导。对有问题的干部，采取不负责任的推出去的错误态度，使干部对领导上不满。整编后，有的区长回家不干了，但领导上也没有及时进行处理。由于领导上单纯逼任务，下层干部就在工作中强迫命令，甚至打人、扣人。凡此一切，都是官僚主义的领导作风的恶果。
