Editor's Note: On June 16th, the "People's Forum" published the handling process of Comrade Wang Fuzhi's beating of women and forcing divorce case. On July 3rd, it also published Comrade Tie Feng's opinions on the handling of this case. The CPC Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district Committee accepted this opinion, re-handled the case, and informed us of the process. The following is a letter from the CPC Shijiazhuang Military Sub-district Committee.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Editor:

When Wang Fuzhi, deputy company commander of our department, was leading production work in Luancheng, he violated the Marriage Law and interfered with Fan Zangni's freedom of marriage. After the incident occurred, the Sub-district Party Committee immediately sent Comrade Dai Zhongxin, Director of the Political Department, to investigate and understand the facts, and to cooperate with the local government and women's federation to handle the matter. At that time, we thought that the comrade had a low level of education, was slow to accept new things, and that the incident occurred before the promulgation of the Marriage Law, and the leadership had not yet conducted in-depth education in the army, and the troops were mostly scattered outside performing tasks. Therefore, in handling this incident, we showed leniency and accommodation to Wang personally, and did not raise this issue to a matter of principle. Facts have proved that the practice at that time did not have much educational effect on Wang, and the masses' reactions were also unfavorable. After Comrade Tie Feng published his opinions in the "People's Forum," the Sub-district Party Committee reconsidered and studied the matter. The Party Committee itself also made a profound self-criticism. It unanimously believed that these opinions were of great enlightenment and help to us, enabling us to have a deeper understanding and comprehension of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China. Therefore, we re-handled this incident; after several talks and education sessions with Deputy Company Commander Wang Fuzhi, it was decided to increase the punishment. He was removed from his administrative position and given a public warning within the Party. The Party Committee also sent a responsible comrade with Wang Fuzhi to the place where the incident occurred—Dongguan Village, Luancheng, to cooperate with the local government and women's federation to hold a mass meeting, report on the handling process, solicit opinions from the masses, and have Wang Fuzhi publicly repent and apologize. The soldier Fan Qishan (Zangni's second brother) was given a confinement punishment. The battalion was also instructed to conduct in-depth education throughout the battalion.

　　The incident has now been handled completely, and the masses' response is good.

　　王福芝吊打妇女强迫离婚事件石家庄军分区已重新处理
    编者按：六月十六日，人民园地发表了王福芝同志吊打妇女、强迫离婚事件的处理经过。七月三日，又发表了铁枫同志对这一事件的处理的意见。中共石家庄军分区党委会接受了这个意见，对该事件重新作了处理，并把经过情形告诉了我们。下面是中共石家庄军分区党委会的来信。          编辑同志：
    我部副连长王福芝在栾城领导生产工作时，违犯了婚姻法，干涉范赃妮的婚姻自由。当事件发生后，分区党委曾立即派政治部主任岱忠信同志前去调查了解事实真相，协同当地政府与妇联作了处理。我们当时以为该同志文化程度低，接受新事物慢，而且事件发生在婚姻法颁布之前，领导上还未在部队中深入进行教育，部队又多分散在外执行任务，故在处理这一事件时，就表现了对王个人的姑息迁就，没有把这一问题提到原则高度来认识。事实证明，当时的作法，对王的教育作用不大，群众的反映也是不好的。经铁枫同志在人民园地上发表意见后，分区党委又重新考虑、研究，党委本身也作了深刻的检讨，一致认为这些意见对我们有很大启示与帮助，使我们对中华人民共和国的婚姻法有了较深刻的认识与领会，因而我们对这一事件重新加以处理；对副连长王福芝进行几次谈话教育后，决定加重处分，在行政上撤职，党内予以当众警告。党委并派一负责同志同王福芝到出事地点——栾城东关村协同当地政府与妇联召开群众大会，报告处理经过，征询群众意见，并由王福芝当众悔过道歉。对战士范岐山（赃妮之二兄）给予禁闭处分。并责成该营在全营进行深入教育。
    该事件现已处理完毕，群众反映良好。
                                          石家庄军分区党委会
                                                 八月二十二日
