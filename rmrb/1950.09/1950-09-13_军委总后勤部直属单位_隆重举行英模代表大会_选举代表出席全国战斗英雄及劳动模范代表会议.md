The General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission Affiliated Units
Grandly Hold Representative Meeting of Heroes and Models
Elect Representatives to Attend the National Conference of Combat Heroes and Labor Models

[Our Newspaper's News] The General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission held a representative meeting of heroes and models on the 10th at Yuying Middle School in Beijing. Special-class combat hero Li He and two others were elected as representatives to attend the National Conference of Combat Heroes and the National Conference of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Labor Models.

The heroes and models representative meeting was attended by thirty-six people selected from units directly under the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, including the Ministry of Health, Tianjin Military Medical University, and the Central Military Commission North China Pharmaceutical Factory, including combat heroes, meritorious personnel in war rescue, and production models. Yang Lisan, Minister of the General Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, and Fu Lianzhang, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health of the Central Military Commission, both attended and spoke, pointing out that the logistics departments, like other departments of the Central Military Commission, have produced countless heroes in the People's Liberation War, ensuring the victory of the people's revolution. They encouraged all heroes and models to maintain their glory, move forward forever, and to remember Chairman Mao's admonition: "You have many advantages and great merits, but you must remember not to be arrogant." At the same time, they must be good at learning from the national combat heroes and models, good at learning from the combat heroes of the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, and learning from the heroes and models of all departments in Korea who are fighting, and strive to build a strong, modern national defense army.

At the meeting, representatives of various units introduced the deeds of heroes and models. Li He, a special-class combat hero currently recuperating at Tianjin Army Hospital, led the charge to seize the Tianjin Minquan Gate in the Tianjin Campaign with selfless spirit, captured five bunkers, killed, wounded and captured more than 300 enemies, and repelled five enemy counterattacks. Li Molin, director of the textile department of the health materials factory of the Central Military Commission North China Pharmaceutical Factory, persisted in military supply production behind enemy lines and was elected as a first-class model three times. The model deeds of the meritorious war rescue member Zhang Qingbo aroused the admiration of all the heroes and models present at the meeting. As a result of the election at the meeting, Li He and Zhang Qingbo were honorably elected as representatives to attend the National Conference of Combat Heroes, and Li Molin was elected as a representative to attend the National Conference of Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Labor Models.
