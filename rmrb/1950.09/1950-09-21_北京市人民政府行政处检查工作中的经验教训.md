Experiences and Lessons from the Administrative Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Work on Inspections

By our reporter Shang Kai

The Administrative Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government concluded its campaign to inspect work style and discipline on July 7th. This article was delayed for too long because it was sent to relevant authorities for review. However, several experiences and lessons from the office's inspection work are still worth noting, so they are still being published. – Editor

The campaign to inspect work style and discipline in the Administrative Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Government lasted 33 days, going through stages of leadership mobilization, document study, and work inspection, concluding on July 7th. This inspection work achieved certain results. However, there were several shortcomings and biases in the leadership's thinking and methods. Director Chao of the Administrative Office used an appropriate analogy to summarize the experiences and lessons of this inspection work. He said: The biggest flaw in the Administrative Office's campaign to inspect work style and discipline was the lack of necessary preparation beforehand. This is like a chef cooking a meal; if you don't know what kind of meal you're going to make beforehand, and you haven't prepared the rice, noodles, vegetables, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, etc., you'll find something missing when you light the fire, and you'll be scrambling and passive. As a result, you naturally won't be able to cook the meal well.

**Leadership Blindly Complacent, Inspection Work Loses Clear Goal**

The main shortcomings and biases of this inspection work in the Administrative Office were manifested in: First, the leadership was not clear beforehand about which major problems needed to be solved in this campaign to inspect work style and discipline. When the responsible comrades of the Administrative Office and the Party branch received instructions from higher authorities regarding inspecting work style and discipline, there was a blind sense of complacency, believing that there were no major problems in the Administrative Office's work, and the inspection would be ordinary. Therefore, they would not conduct investigations and studies beforehand to clarify what problems existed in the Administrative Office's work. Even if there was some bureaucratic work style, it was understood very abstractly. This made it impossible for the leadership to formulate an inspection work plan with a clear purpose around the current main work of the department; instead, it was generally stipulated: study documents from such-and-such day to such-and-such day, small group discussions from such-and-such day to such-and-such day, etc. Precisely because the leadership lacked a clear goal, they felt a lack of specific methods, which affected their confidence in leading the rectification. According to the leading cadres of the office: After repeatedly studying the instructions on rectification from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, they further understood the spirit of rectification, clarified the content, methods, and purpose of rectification, and enhanced their leadership confidence. In fact, they were limited to studying the instructions based on the instructions, so their understanding of the spirit, content, methods, and purpose of rectification was still limited, and it was abstract and vague. For example, in order to dispel the cadres' idea that there was "no one to rectify," the mobilization failed to point out the main problems in the overall work and work style of the office to enlighten everyone; instead, it listed some individual examples such as the receptionist and the reception staff treating guests poorly, claiming that this was bureaucracy. This led everyone to mistakenly understand that "everyone, big and small, has a little bit of this in this inspection." Although this dispelled the idea that there was "no one to rectify," it indirectly guided everyone to pursue some life details and individual problems, relaxing the inspection of the main problems in the department.

**From Top to Bottom, Underestimating the Study of Documents, Inspection Work Lacks Weapons**

Second, from top to bottom, there was an underestimation of the study of documents. The Administrative Office studied the designated documents from June 5th to 10th. Old cadres believed that criticism and self-criticism, strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses, etc., were old problems of the past decade, and everyone already knew about them, so why study them! New cadres did not try to understand the spirit of the documents by linking them to reality, but circled around the words and phrases, so they could not get into it and felt very bored. Even the leading cadres of the Administrative Office did not fully recognize the importance of studying documents. When they saw that most of the old cadres in the Administrative Office had low levels of education, and the new cadres had poor political levels, and there were many documents and little time, and many difficulties in studying, they mistakenly believed that if they could not study the documents well, they could still experience the spirit of rectification in actual practice and gradually improve their understanding of the problems. Therefore, they did not use oral lectures combined with practical discussions or other appropriate methods to help everyone study. As a result, in six days, the documents were only read through generally and hastily, and some people did not even finish reading them once. Although several symposiums were held, the discussions could not be profound because they could not be linked to reality. Later, the facts proved that everyone did not understand the spirit and essence of the documents.

**Cadre Concerns Rise One After Another, Inspection Work Avoids the Important and Emphasizes the Minor**

If the documents were not studied well, then the weapons for inspection work were not prepared. In the inspection, the ideological concerns of the cadres rose one after another, hindering the progress of the movement. At the small group discussion meetings, the cadres' emotions were not enthusiastic, and they were not bold in exposing problems, and the discussions were mostly about avoiding the important and emphasizing the minor, only talking about generalities, not specifics, or talking about some life details. Some leading cadres were worried about exposing problems in front of the masses; some even refused to accept others' opinions. Zhang Wenshan, the head of the Management Section, threw a tantrum and slammed the table because someone gave him an opinion to his face, which had a very bad influence. Later, it was improved through various mobilizations and small group discussions. However, there was still more self-criticism and less mutual criticism at the small group meetings. Therefore, in the formal inspection, criticism and self-criticism were still not carried out.

**Leading Cadres' Self-Criticism Reports are Not Timely, Causing Some Cadres to Have Doubts and Dissatisfaction**

Another problem in the inspection work was that the leading cadres did not play a leading role. Originally, before summarizing the inspection work, the main cadres of the Administrative Office should first make a self-criticism report based on investigations and analysis and put forward the main problems, to enlighten and guide everyone to inspect the main problems. However, because the leading cadres did not understand what major problems existed in the work of their departments; and they were afraid that if the first self-criticism was not good, it would be better to do only one report than to do a second self-criticism report. Therefore, they waited until everyone had inspected and then made an inspection summary report based on everyone's opinions. This does not conform to the method of inspecting and summarizing work from top to bottom and its important role. As a result, it aroused the suspicion and dissatisfaction of some cadres, and someone once reflected: "We are the only ones being inspected, are they (referring to the main cadres) also being inspected?" Under these circumstances, it is impossible to conduct in-depth inspection work.

**Ignoring the Inspection of Main Problems Inevitably Emphasizes the Exposure of Individual and Personal Problems**

Since the inspection work could not grasp the main problems, it inevitably emphasized the exposure of individual and personal problems, resulting in the inspection becoming a formality. For example: the head of the Transportation Section takes too many car rides, and the head of the Management Section has a bad attitude. Some people even suggested that wearing powder is corruption, and eating a meal at another agency is embezzlement. Some people even argued endlessly over an unimportant word. During this stage, although the leadership also tried to correct these obvious biases at any time, due to the lack of a clear basic direction, they could not guide everyone's inspection to develop in the correct direction, but rather treated the head when it hurt and the foot when it hurt. As a result, they could only be entangled in some minor issues. The inspection summaries of the various departments of the Administrative Office, including Director Chao's inspection summary, mostly put on a big hat of bureaucracy, followed by a series of small hats such as too much work arrangement and too little inspection, work system not strict, and cadre preoccupation with routine affairs. Then, several fragmented and even unrelated examples are listed under each article. What are the basic problems of the Administrative Office and its various departments? What are the main problems manifested in bureaucracy? How much harm does it cause to the work? Where does the ideological root lie? These questions were not clearly resolved in this inspection.

Naturally, this inspection work also achieved some results. For example, it exposed the embezzlement of certain cadres, the preoccupation with routine affairs of leading cadres, lack of thoroughness in work, and the phenomenon of party member cadres' monopolization, and also solved some problems of disunity between party members, and between leaders and cadres. After the inspection, the relationship between the Party and the masses was improved, and the morale of the cadres was higher than before, but because the leadership had the above-mentioned shortcomings, they could not discover and solve the main problems of the office's work in the inspection work, and the movement was still limited to some fragmented and individual problems, and the results were not significant.

　　北京市人民政府行政处检查工作中的经验教训
    本报记者  商恺
    北京市人民政府行政处的检查作风检查纪律运动已于七月七日结束。此稿因送有关机关阅看，致拖延过久。但该处检查工作中的几点经验教训，还是值得各地注意的，故仍加以发表。——编者
    北京市人民政府行政处检查作风检查纪律运动，经过首长动员、学习文件、检查工作等阶段，历时三十三天，于七月七日结束。这次检查工作，获得了一定的成绩。但在领导思想与领导方法上，是存在着若干缺点和偏向的。行政处晁处长曾用一个恰当的比喻来总结这次检查工作的经验教训。他说：行政处的检查作风纪律运动，最大的缺点是事先没有做好必要的准备工作。这好比厨师做饭炒菜，如果事前不明白做什么饭，没有将米面、菜蔬、油、盐、酱、醋等准备妥当，等到燃起火来，便会发现缺这个少那个，手忙脚乱，陷于被动。结果，自然不能将饭做好。
    领导上盲目自满，检查工作失去明确目标
    这次行政处检查工作的主要缺点和偏向表现在：首先是领导上对于在此次检查作风纪律运动中，要解决那几个主要问题，事先是不明确的。当行政处的负责同志和党的支部接到上级关于检查作风检查纪律的指示后，曾存在着盲目自满情绪，认为行政处工作中没有大的问题，检查起来也是平平常常。因而也就不会在事先进行调查研究，以明确行政处工作中究竟存在着什么问题了。即使说有一些官僚主义作风，也是了解得很抽象的。这使领导上就不可能去围绕本部门当前主要工作，制定出一个具有明确目的性的检查工作计划；而是笼统的规定：从某日到某日学习文件，从某日到某日小组漫谈等。正是由于领导上缺乏明确的目标，就感到缺少具体办法，影响了领导整风的信心。据该处领导干部谈：后来反复研读了中共中央以及中共中央华北局关于整风的指示，才进一步的领会了整风的精神，明确了整风的内容、方法和目的，增强了领导信心。事实上他们也只限于就指示研究指示，这样对整风精神、内容、方法和目的的领会仍然是有所限制的，并且是抽象的、模糊的。例如：为解除干部中“没整头”的思想，在启发动员中，未能举出全处工作与作风中的主要问题，来启发大家；而是列举了一些什么传达室、招待所有人对待客人态度不好，这就是官僚主义等个别事例。因而使大家错误的领会到“这样检查，大大小小谁也有点”。这样虽然解除了“没整头”的思想，但无形中又引导了大家去追究一些生活细节，与个别问题，放松了对部门中主要问题的检查。
    自上而下轻视学习文件，检查工作缺乏武器
    其次是从上而下轻视学习文件。行政处于六月五日至十日学习指定文件。老干部认为批评与自我批评、加强党群关系等，都是十几年来的老问题，谁还不知道，学它干什么！新干部则不从联系实际来体会文件精神，而是在词句上打圈子，这样就钻不进去，感到非常乏味。就是行政处的领导干部，对学习文件的重要性，也是认识不足的。当他们看到行政处老干部多半文化程度低，新干部政治水平差，文件多，时间短，学习中困难很多，便错误地认为学不好文件，还可以到实际运动中去体会整风精神，逐渐提高对问题的认识。因而也没有采用口头讲授结合实际讨论或其他适当方式来帮助大家学习。结果在六天中，对文件只一般的潦草的读了一遍，有的人连一遍也没有读完。虽然也举行了几次座谈会，但因不能联系实际，讨论就不能够深刻。后来事实证明，大家对文件的精神与实质，确实是没有领会的。
    干部顾虑此起彼伏，检查工作避重就轻
    文件没有读好，这就没有准备好检查工作的武器。在检查中，干部的思想顾虑，此起彼伏，障碍着运动的前进。小组漫谈会上，干部情绪不热烈，暴露问题不大胆，谈起来多是避重就轻，只谈一般的，不谈具体的，或是谈一些生活细节。有的领导干部，对于在群众面前暴露问题有顾虑；甚至还有拒绝别人提意见的。管理科长张文山，就因为别人当面给他提了意见，拍桌子大发脾气，影响很坏。后来经过多方启发动员、小组漫谈才有所改进。但小组会上仍是自我批评多，互相批评少。因此在正式检查中，批评与自我批评仍是没有展开。
    领导干部检讨报告不及时，使某些干部产生怀疑和不满
    检查工作中的另一个问题是：领导干部没有起到带头作用。本来在总结检查工作之前，行政处的主要干部，应当先做一个有调查有分析并提出主要问题的检讨报告，启发和引导大家检查主要问题。但由于领导干部不了解本部门工作中存在什么样的主要问题；又怕一次检讨不好，再做第二次检讨报告，还不如一次报告好。于是一直等到大家检查后，根据大家意见，做了一个检查总结报告。这就不符合于自上而下检查总结工作的方法和它所起的重要作用。以致引起一些干部的怀疑与不满，曾有人反映：“光让咱们检查，他们（指主要干部）是不是也检查？”在这种情况下，检查工作是不可能深入的。
    忽略检查主要问题，必然偏重于个别和个人问题的暴露
    在检查工作中既然抓不到主要问题，就必然偏重于个别和个人问题的暴露，结果使检查流于形式。例如：交通科长坐汽车太多，管理科长态度不好。还有的人提出：擦粉是腐化，到别的机关吃顿饭是贪污等，甚至还有的人为一句无关重要的话争吵不休。在这一阶段中，领导上对这些显著的偏向，虽然也曾随时予以纠正，但由于基本方向不明确，不能引导大家的检查往正确的方向发展，而是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，结果当然只能纠缠在一些小问题上。行政处各部门的检查总结，连同晁处长的检查总结在内，多半都是戴上一个官僚主义的大帽子，下面便是工作布置多检查少、工作制度不严格、干部事务主义等一串小帽子。然后每条下面列举几条零碎甚至互不相关的事例。到底行政处以及各部门的基本问题是什么？官僚主义表现在那几个主要问题上？它给予工作有多大的危害？思想根源在那里？并没有从这次检查中得到明确的解决。
    自然这次检查工作也还是有成绩的。比如揭发了某些干部的贪污行为，领导干部的事务主义，工作不深入，党员干部的包办现象，同时也解决了某些党员间的、领导与干部间的不团结问题。检查后，党群关系获得改善，干部情绪较前高涨，但由于领导上存在以上几个缺点，而使在检查工作中就不能发现与解决该处工作的主要问题，运动还局限于一些零碎片断的个别问题上，收效就不大。
