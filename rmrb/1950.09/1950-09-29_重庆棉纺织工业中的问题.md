　　Problems in Chongqing's Cotton Textile Industry
　　Liu Wei
　　Chongqing's cotton textile industry has more than 140,000 spindles, accounting for more than 50% of the approximately 240,000 spindles in the Southwest region (a very small proportion compared to the national total of 5.2 million spindles). Since Chongqing's liberation in November last year, for the past nine months, with the support of the local People's Government and the state-owned China National Cotton, Yarn and Cloth Corporation in supplying raw cotton, purchasing finished products, and processing on a commission basis, the cotton textile industry has basically maintained production in various factories.
　　However, most yarn factories in Chongqing are still in a rather difficult position. Generally, production cannot achieve self-sufficiency at the breakeven point; the most important reason is that production costs are too high – far exceeding the production costs of state-owned and private yarn factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places. Currently, the actual cotton consumption per piece of yarn in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin is no more than 410 jin, and the labor and processing fee in Shanghai is 224 real units (currently, each real unit in Shanghai is worth 5,100 yuan, equivalent to about 3.6 jin of rice); while in Chongqing, the cotton consumption per piece of yarn requires 440 to 470 jin, and the labor and processing fee requires 300 to 500 real units (currently, each real unit in Chongqing is worth 4,970 yuan, equivalent to about 5.4 jin of rice), exceeding the cotton consumption in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin by 7.3% to 14.6% and the labor and processing fee by about 30% to 120%.
　　So, what are the reasons that the production costs of yarn factories in Chongqing have remained so high for more than half a year since liberation? According to incomplete survey materials from various sources, the most fundamental reasons for the excessively high production costs are:
　　First: All factories have poor raw material management and serious waste, and there is no strict economic accounting system. There are no specific standards or accurate calculations for the consumption of raw materials, supplies, water, and electricity. Some inventories have not been inventoried for more than ten years, and some have no inventory on the books, but in reality, there are large stocks. Fraudulent practices such as underreporting and over-recording are also very serious in the accounts. For example, the iron workshop of the Shenxin Yarn Factory uses one ton of coal per month, with vouchers available, but the books record eight tons of coal per month; the power plant under the factory received five chi of flannel on April 19, but the books recorded five zhang. The market price of No. 18 leather cord purchased in late May was more than 20,000 yuan, while the highest price in April was more than 50,000 yuan, but the factory recorded it as 100,000 yuan in the April accounts. In addition, it is common for hundreds of lights in the staff dormitories of some factories to remain on all night, and for water taps to be left unrepaired or unturned off after use. The fact that individual yarn factories provide unlimited coal and free food to the families of their employees without any specific standards or systems also has an impact on the increase in production costs.
　　Second: The organizations are bloated and large, with too many non-productive indirect personnel. The business, accounting, and general affairs departments have the most staff and the highest salaries, but most of them are idle on a daily basis. A factory with 11,100 spindles has nearly 100 staff; another factory with 11,600 spindles has as many as 309 odd-job workers. The Shashi Factory has a dedicated construction department with 43 workers, who only do some unnecessary painting work on a daily basis. When a larger project is encountered, temporary workers are still hired or contracted out, which is practically a mere formality. The factory's guard team has 30 people, with little work and high salaries. The monthly salary of the chief of the guards and inspectors averages more than 150 real units, which is higher than that of direct production technicians. In addition, there are two hired pianists and one coach, with monthly salaries of about 150 units.
　　Third: Some factories falsely reported a portion of the raw cotton consumption when negotiating processing and spinning contracts with the government. For example, the Shenxin Factory reported in April that it needed 470 jin of raw cotton per piece of yarn, and the Shashi Factory reported 442.21 jin. However, after concrete investigation and calculation, without accounting for waste or offsetting waste cotton with raw cotton, the cotton consumption per piece of yarn was 440.2 jin for the Shenxin Factory, which was 29.8 jin less than the originally reported number. The Shashi Factory was 439.34 jin, which was also less than the originally reported number by 2.87 jin.
　　From the above situation, it can be seen that the excessively high production cost of Chongqing's cotton textile industry is mainly due to the lack of an economic accounting system and poor management. During the War of Resistance Against Japan and after the war, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, due to malignant inflation, producers often had to lose money, while speculators could easily obtain huge profits. Many yarn factories neglected the rational management of the factory, focusing most of their energy on coping with the market and little energy on production management. As a result, the number of personnel in the business, accounting, and general affairs departments, which were not directly involved in production, increased, resulting in huge expenses, and various wastes also occurred. After liberation, they did not quickly transform their original organizations and change their original management methods based on the new situation, but simply emphasized the special circumstances of the Southwest and demanded that the government provide assistance and care. According to the different situations of the three factories, Shenxin, Shashi (both private), and Yufeng (state-owned), after investigation and experimentation, if the waste part of the raw cotton consumption per piece of yarn is removed and the waste cotton is offset against the raw cotton, the amount of cotton required by each factory in April compared to the actual amount of cotton used is as follows:
　　Factory Name　　Reported Cotton Consumption in April　　Actual Consumption　　Percentage Reduction
　　Shenxin:　　　　470 jin　　　　　　　　420.8 jin　　　　　　10.46
　　Shashi:　　　　442.21 jin　　　　　　426.79 jin　　　　　　3.46
　　Yufeng:　　　　——　　　　　　　　　444.0 jin　　　　　　——
　　(Note: The Yufeng Factory is missing the reported number, and the waste cotton in the actual cotton consumption is not deducted as an offset to raw cotton.)
　　Similarly, on the issue of labor and processing fees, after detailed investigation and calculation, if the various expenses that can be saved now are deducted, the labor and processing fees required per piece of yarn compared to the labor and processing fees reported by each factory in April are as follows:
　　Factory Name　　Reported Labor and Processing Fees in April　　Actual Required Labor and Processing Fees　　Percentage Reduction
　　　　　　　　　　(Real Units)　　　　　　　　　　　　(Same as above)
　　Shenxin　　　　496.56　　　　　　　　282.47　　　　　　　　43.11
　　Shashi　　　　336.28　　　　　　　　257.90　　　　　　　　23.6
　　Yufeng　　　　303.92　　　　　　　　245.06　　　　　　　　19.36
　　The actual consumption of raw cotton and labor and processing fees per piece of yarn listed in the table above still exceeds that of Shanghai yarn factories by 10% to 28%. At present, transportation throughout the country has almost completely recovered, and various materials can flow smoothly without obstruction. If the current ex-factory price of Shanghai yarn (it must be pointed out that the production cost of cotton yarn in Shanghai is still high compared to before the war) is added to the river shipping cost between Shanghai and Chongqing, which is about 18%, plus business expenses and interest, etc., selling a piece of yarn transported from Shanghai to Chongqing would still be lower than the highest ex-factory price of cotton yarn produced by yarn factories in Chongqing. Under such circumstances, if Chongqing's cotton textile industry does not quickly improve its management and reduce production costs, it will be difficult to maintain the continued production of yarn factories; even if it is maintained, it will not be easy to achieve further development. The government's care and assistance must be based on self-reliance in order to play a greater role, and this care is also limited and should not be unconditional. Therefore, transforming the old organization and improving management to gradually reduce production costs is the effort that Chongqing's cotton textile industry should make at present. Of course, in the process of transformation, it must be:
　　(1) The factory should first actively take responsibility, make careful calculations, and earnestly improve the unreasonable parts of its current management and improve production efficiency. Only in this way can it be combined with the People's Government's correct policy of overall consideration, correct the past view of simply relying on government relief, and make every effort to use the original funds for turnover and gradually make the factory's production more planned.
　　(2) In state-owned factories and enterprises, "we must resolutely change the old bureaucratic management system, implement democratic management, establish factory management committees, and absorb workers to participate in production management in order to enlighten the workers' sense of ownership and promote the workers' conscious labor enthusiasm." In private factories and enterprises, under the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, labor-management consultation meetings should be established, and labor and capital should conduct consultations together on an equal footing, put forward the specific facts of mismanagement in various departments of the factory, study them together, and find solutions, and use the strength of all employees to improve production efficiency, improve management, and overcome current difficulties in order to gradually achieve self-sufficiency at the breakeven point and obtain profits.
　　(3) Establish a strict economic accounting system, and on this basis, establish a cost accounting system. There should be certain standards for the consumption of raw materials, supplies, water, electricity, etc., and gradually establish a quota system, practice thrift, eliminate malpractices, and gradually reduce production costs.
　　In terms of transforming the old organization and improving management, there are many examples in state-owned and private enterprises in Shanghai and other places that are worth emulating. In the past, Shanghai's private Defeng Yarn Factory had poor internal management, and the capitalists were not enthusiastic about production, the employees were irresponsible, and the production efficiency was very low. However, since labor and capital openly negotiated, the capitalists actively managed the factory, and the employees' enthusiasm for production greatly increased. The productivity increased from 0.57 pounds in January this year to 0.86 pounds in March, exceeding the capitalists' requirement of 0.8 pounds, breaking the factory's historical production record. Another example is Litai Textile Factory, which was shut down for three months in the past due to its large organization, bloated personnel, and unreasonable management. Later, through labor-management consultation, under the principle of maintaining production and overcoming difficulties, the factory streamlined its organization, improved its management methods, and greatly reduced its production costs. In April, the cotton consumption per piece of yarn was calculated at 410 jin and the labor and processing fee was calculated at 200 real units. As a result, processing 1,000 pieces of yarn resulted in a profit of 12,200 real units. This example vividly shows that as long as the capitalists actively manage the factory and labor and capital consult together, the difficulties can be overcome, and the production cost can be gradually reduced to a reasonable level. At present, the entire mainland of China except Tibet has been completely liberated, and the Southwest region has a total population of more than 70 million people, and there is a vast sales market for cotton textiles. Under the government's policy of overall consideration, as long as colleagues in the textile industry are good at management and unite the vast number of employees to gradually reduce costs, we believe that Chongqing's cotton textile industry has a broad prospect for development.

　　重庆棉纺织工业中的问题
    刘为
    重庆市棉纺织工业共有纱锭十四万余枚，占西南区现有纱锭总数约二十四万枚的百分之五十以上（与全国纱锭设备总数的五百二十万枚相较，所占比例则极微小）。自去年十一月间重庆解放后，至今九个月来，棉纺织业在当地人民政府及国营花纱布公司的源源供给原棉、收购成品、加工代纺等扶助下，基本上维持了各厂的生产。
    但是，目前重庆的大部分纱厂仍处着相当困难的地位。一般的生产皆不能达到保本自给；其最主要的原因是生产成本太高——远超过沪、青、津等地公私营纱厂的生产成本。目前沪、青、津三市纱厂每件纱的实际用棉量均未超过四一○市斤，工缴费上海为二二四个折实单位（现在上海每一折实单位计人民币五千一百元，折米约三点六市斤）；而重庆市纱厂每件纱的用棉量则需四四○市斤至四七○市斤，工缴费需三百至五百个折实单位（现在重庆每一折实单位计人民币四千九百七十元，折米约五点四市斤），较沪、青、津每件纱用棉量超过百分之七点三至百分之十四点六，工缴费约超过百分之三十至百分之一百二十。
    那么，究竟是什么原因使得重庆的纱厂在解放以后半年多以来的生产成本仍保持如此之高呢？根据各方面不完整之调查材料分析，其生产成本过高的最基本原因是：
    第一：各厂均存在着原材料管理不善和严重的浪费的现象，没有严格的经济核算制度。原料、物料、水电用量没有一定的标准和精确的计算。库存物料有的竟有十多年都未曾清点过，有的账上已无存货，而实际上库存却甚多。账目上以少报多、发少记多的作弊行为亦很严重。例如申新纱厂的铁工房月用煤一吨，有门票可凭，账上记的却是月用煤八吨；该厂所属动力厂四月十九日领绒布五尺，账上记作五丈，另购进之十八号皮线，五月下旬市价是两万余元，四月最高价是五万余元，但该厂四月份账上却记为十万元。此外，有的厂职工宿舍中数百盏电灯通宵不灭，水管龙头坏了不及时修理，用水后不关龙头等浪费现象则是常事。个别纱厂对于职工的眷属由厂方全部无限制供给燃煤及免费领取食粮，没有一定的标准和制度，这对生产成本的增加，亦不无影响。
    第二：机构臃肿庞大，不事生产的间接人员过多。营业、会计、总务等部门职员最多，待遇也最高，但日常则大多闲散无事。一家一万一千一百个纱绽的工厂竟有将近一百个职员；另一家一万一千六百纱绽的工厂，其勤杂人员即有三百零九人之多。沙市厂专设一个建筑部，有工人四十三名，日常只作些不必要的粉刷工作，一遇较大工程，仍需雇用临时工或出包，实际形同虚设。该厂警卫队有三十人，工作既少，待遇也高，警长、稽查等月薪平均在一五○个折实单位以上，高出直接生产的技术工人。此外还雇有琴师二人，教练一人，月薪亦在一五○个单位左右。
    第三：有的厂方在与政府谈订加工代纺合同时，虚报了一部分原棉用量。例如申新厂四月份自报每件纱需用原棉四七○市斤，沙市厂自报数为四四二点二一市斤，但经过具体调查计算后，不计浪费，亦不将废棉折抵原棉，其每件纱之用棉量申新厂为四四○点二市斤，较原报数减少了二九点八市斤。沙市厂为四三九点三四市斤，亦少于原报数二点八七市斤。
    从以上情况中，可以看出：目前重庆棉纺织工业的生产成本过高，主要系缺乏经济核算制度，经营管理不善所致。抗战时期及抗战以后，在国民党反动统治下，因恶性通货膨胀，生产者常要赔本，而投机者却易得到暴利的情况下，许多纱厂就忽视了对于工厂的合理经营，以绝大部分的精力去应付市场，而以很少的精力从事生产管理，结果使得不事直接生产的营业、会计、总务等部门人员增加，开支浩大，各种浪费亦随之产生。在解放后，又不根据新的情况迅速改造其原有的机构及改变其原来的经营管理方式，单纯强调西南情况特殊，要求政府给以扶助与照顾。根据经过调查试验后的申新、沙市（以上是私营）、豫丰（公营）等三个厂的不同情况，其每件纱原棉用量若除去浪费部分，并将下脚花折抵原棉，四月份各厂自报需棉量与实际用棉量有如下表：
    厂名    四月份自         实际需用量      减少百分比
            报用棉量
    申新：  四七○斤         四二○·八斤    一○·四六
    沙市：  四四二·二一斤   四二六·七九斤  三·四六
    豫丰：  ——             四四四·○斤    ——
    （注：豫丰厂缺自报数，其实际用棉量中下脚花未折抵原棉扣除。）
    同样，在工缴费问题上，经调查详细计算后，如果将现在就可以节约的各项开支减去的话，则每件纱所需工缴费与四月份各厂自报之工缴费是这样：
    厂名   四月份自       实际需要        减少百分比
           报工缴费       工缴费
          （折实单位）   （仝上）
    申新   四九六·五六   二八二·四七    四三·一一
    沙市   三三六·二八   二五七·九○    二三·六
    豫丰   三○三·九二   二四五·○六    一九·三六
    上表所列目前每件纱的原棉实际用量及工缴费，与上海纱厂相较，仍超出百分之十至百分之二十八以上。目前全国交通几已全部恢复，各种物资皆可畅流无阻。如果以目前上海每件纱的出厂价格（必须指出：现在上海棉纱的生产成本和战前比较也还是高的），加上沪渝间江航运费百分之十八左右，再加上业务费用及利息等等，一件纱由上海运到重庆出售，仍低于重庆市纱厂所产棉纱中之最高出厂价格。在这样的情况下，重庆棉纺织工业若不迅速改善经营管理，降低生产成本，要维持纱厂的继续生产是有困难的；纵然维持住了，要想求得进一步的发展，则是不容易的。政府的照顾与扶助，必须是在自力更生的基础上，才能发挥更大的作用，而且这种照顾也是有一定限度的，并不是也不应是无条件的照顾。因此，改造旧有的机构和改善经营管理，达到逐步降低生产成本，是目前重庆棉纺织工业所应作的努力。当然，在改造过程中，必须是：
    （一）厂方应首先积极负责，精打细算，认真改善其目前经营管理中之不合理部分，提高生产效率，只有这样才能与人民政府统筹兼顾的正确政策相结合，纠正过去那种单纯依赖政府的救济观点，尽力利用原有的资金以供周转，并使工厂的生产逐渐走向计划性。
    （二）在国营的工厂企业中“必须坚决的改变旧的官僚主义的管理制度，实行管理民主化，建立工厂管理委员会，吸收工人参加生产管理，以启发工人的主人翁的觉悟，发扬工人的自觉的劳动热情。”而在私营工厂企业中，应在劳资两利的原则下，成立劳资协商会议，劳资双方在平等的基础上共同进行协商，把存在于工厂各部门不合经营管理的具体事实提出来共同研究，并找出解决办法，用全体职工的力量，来达到提高生产效率，改进经营管理，克服目前困难，以逐步做到保本自给及获得利润。
    （三）建立严格的经济核算制度，并在这个基础上建立起成本会计制度。对于原料、物料、水电等的用量应有一定的标准，逐渐树立定额制度，厉行节约，根绝流弊，使生产成本逐步降低。
    在改造旧的机构与改善经营管理上，上海及其他各地公私营企业中有很多的例子，值得仿效。上海私营德丰纱厂，过去内部经营不善，资方生产情绪不高，员工不负责任，生产效率甚低，但自劳资双方开诚协商，资方积极经营，职工生产积极性即大大提高，生产率由今年一月份的点五七磅达到三月份的零点八六磅，超过资方零点八磅要求，打破该厂历年来之生产纪录。又如利泰纺织厂由于过去机构庞大，人事臃肿，经营不合理等曾停工三月，后来也是经过劳资协商，在维持生产克服困难的原则下，实行精简机构，改善经营方式，大大地降低了生产成本，四月份代纺每件纱原棉用量按四一○市斤，工缴费以二百个折实单位计算，结果代纺一千件纱计获利润一万二千二百个折实单位。这种例子，生动地说明了只要资方积极经营，并通过劳资共同协商，其困难是可以克服的，而生产成本也是完全可以逐步地降到合理的水平的。目前全国大陆上除西藏外已经完全解放，西南全区共有七千余万人口，棉纺织品是有广大的销售市场的。在政府统筹兼顾的政策下，只要纺织界同仁善于经营，团结广大员工逐渐减低成本，我们相信，重庆棉纺织工业是有其广阔的发展前途的。
