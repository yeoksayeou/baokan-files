　　Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory Rectification Reveals:
    Cadre Overlapping Duties Affect Production;
    The Deviation of Solely Relying on Production Activists Without Following the Mass Line Urgently Needs Correction
    [Our Zhangjiakou Dispatch] The Zhangjiakou Cigarette Factory, during this rectification movement, discovered that excessive overlapping of duties has seriously affected production. What should be particularly noted is the failure to correctly cultivate and utilize production activists and model workers, causing them to become detached from the masses and affecting production. The majority of personnel directly leading production in each workshop hold multiple positions concurrently. For example, Li Qinglin is the director of the substation boiler room, and also serves as the factory trade union vice chairman, factory trade union health and safety director, Party branch secretary, and substation foreman, holding five positions in total. Hao Wanxiang, originally the director of the repair shop, is also a member of the Party general branch committee, a worker representative, a member of the management committee, an executive member of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and a standing committee member of the Municipal Factory Trade Union, holding six positions in total. Ren Qingshan, director of the packaging room, and Niu Deshan, director of the cutting room, each hold more than three positions concurrently. This overlapping of duties leads to numerous meetings. The factory has a total of twenty-nine committees (including Party, Youth League, trade union branch committees, and branch committees), and those with overlapping duties are mostly members or responsible cadres of these committees. They need to plan production, are busy attending meetings, and frequently travel to the province and city for meetings. Some people attend an average of three meetings a day. In addition, meetings lack preparation, dragging on for a long time without resolving issues, resulting in a significant waste of time.

    The most serious issue is that after production activists and model workers were promoted to cadres, the leadership did not correctly utilize these backbone elements to improve intermediate elements and win over backward elements. They only focused on a small number of activists, using them extensively but providing little specific help. This resulted in a small number of production activists becoming detached from the masses and affecting production, leading some people to be unwilling to be model workers. For example, female worker Wen Shuqin, in addition to holding seven positions within the factory, also serves as a member of the Municipal Women's Federation. Zhang Xiulan, in addition to holding four positions within the factory, also serves as an executive member of the Municipal Women's Federation, and an executive member of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. Due to the large number of concurrent positions and meetings, Zhang Xiulan earned one hundred catties of rice less in wages in March, affecting both production and her livelihood. Therefore, when selecting model workers in the third quarter, Zhang Xiulan said, "I don't want to be a model worker anymore." Female model worker Ma Pinpin also felt distressed and requested a job transfer several times. Why has this serious phenomenon occurred? This is the inevitable result of the factory's leading cadres only trusting a small number of activists and not trusting the broad masses, only using a small number of activists and not following the mass line. This serious lesson should be given high attention and thoroughly resolved in this rectification movement. (Jiao Dahai, Li Shiyuan, Ren Qingshan, Li Hongyuan)

　　张垣纸烟厂整风中发现
    干部兼职多影响生产
    不走群众路线单纯使用生产积极分子的偏向亟待纠正
    【本报张家口讯】张垣纸烟厂在这次整风中，检查出由于兼职过多，严重影响生产的现象；尤应特别引起注意的，是没有正确的培养和使用生产中的积极分子与劳模，致使他们脱离群众，影响生产。各车间直接领导生产人员绝大部分身兼数职，如李清林是变电锅炉室主任，兼厂工会副主任、厂工会卫生安全部长、党分支书记、变电室工长等五个职务；郝万祥原修理室主任，党总支委员，职工代表、管委会委员、市总工会执行委员，市工厂工会常务委员等六个职务；包任室主任任庆山，调切室主任牛德山等均兼三个以上的职务。因兼职多就带来了会议多。该厂共有二十九种委员会（包括党、团、工分委、支委员会），兼职者多是其中的委员或负责干部，他们既需计划生产，又需忙于参加会议，还时常到省市去开会，有的人平均每日要开三次会。加之会议缺乏准备，时间拖得很长，解决不了问题，尤为时间上的浪费。
    最严重的是生产中积极分子和英模被提拔为干部后，领导上没有正确运用这批骨干分子，提高中间分子，争取落后分子；只在这少数积极分子身上打圈子，对他们使用多，具体帮助少，结果造成了少数生产积极分子脱离群众，影响生产，因此有的人不愿当模范。如女工文淑琴除在本厂兼任七职外，还兼市妇联委员；张秀兰除兼本厂四职外，还兼市妇联执行委员，市总工会执行委员等，因为兼职多、开会多，张秀兰三月份少挣工资一百斤米，既影响生产，也影响生活。因此第三季评选模范时张秀兰说：“我不当模范了”。女工模范马品聘也感到了苦恼，几次要求调动工作。为什么会产生这种严重现象呢？这是由于该厂领导干部只相信少数积极分子，不相信广大群众，只会使用少数积极分子，不会走群众路线的必然结果。这一严重教训应引起高度的重视，并应在此次整风中求得彻底解决。（焦大海、李士元、任庆山、李宏源）
