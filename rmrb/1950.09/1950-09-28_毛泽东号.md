  Thirty-eight, Glorious Entry into the Pass

    The higher Party organization approved comrades Li Yong, Hu Chundong, and Zhu Dianji as probationary party members.
    The branch held a general meeting of party members to hold the admission ceremony for the three comrades, and welcomed the masses to participate. Many people participated, and Zheng Dugong also participated; but the more he listened, the more he thought, the more he thought, the more he hated himself, the more he hated himself, the more he wanted to cry. After listening for a while, he didn't have the courage to listen anymore, so he walked out of the meeting place. Shang Baoheng was afraid that he would be asked to speak like at the farewell party. He thought: It's easy to speak at the farewell party, but what can I say at this meeting that would not be embarrassing! So he found an opportunity to go on a business trip beforehand. …
    All preparations for entering the pass were completed.
    At 22:55 on March 20, 1949, nearly midnight, the Mao Zedong locomotive departed from the Harbin Locomotive Depot. Director Zhuang of the Railway Administration, the Director of the Political Department, the Chief of the Locomotive Department, the Depot Chief, Representative Zhang, the Branch Secretary, the Chairman of the Trade Union, and many comrades from the Locomotive Depot came to see them off. The lights were bright, illuminating the laughing and cheering people, and the platform was filled with joy!
    “Extend the responsibility system to all of China!”
    “Wish you victory!”
    “Live up to everyone's expectations!”
    The locomotive started, spewing thick smoke, piercing through the clear night, rumbling, rumbling, gradually from slow to fast, from near to far. It was shiny and bright, carrying warmth and strength, and speeding forward!
    In the dead of night, the forest of waving hands of the well-wishers fell far behind. …
    Along the way, passing through major cities such as Changchun, Shenyang, Jinzhou, Shanhaiguan, and Tianjin, and many stations, workers, students, and women welcomed and saw them off in groups; newspaper reporters came to interview; photography reporters came to take pictures; leaders and cadres from various bureaus, depots, and stations came to express their regards; there was no end to the joy and excitement. …
    All the comrades in the train were more aware of the glory of serving the people, and tears of emotion flowed continuously along the way. Especially Lao Shang and Lao Zheng, who were both happy and ashamed. The two privately agreed and were determined to correct their shortcomings, study hard, work actively, and strive to catch up with everyone like driving an express train. (Attached picture)

  三十八、光荣进关
    上级党批准了李永、胡春东、朱殿吉三个同志为候补党员。
    支部召开了党员大会，给三个同志举行入党仪式，欢迎群众参加。群众参加的很多，郑笃恭也参加了；可是他越听越思想，越思想越恨自己，越恨自己越想哭，听了一半没有勇气再听下去，就走出了会场。商宝恒怕像在欢送会上一样要他讲话，他想：在欢送会上好讲，在这个会上丢人现眼的讲什么！事先就找机会出差去了。……
    进关的一切准备工作已经完毕。
    一九四九年三月二十号二十二点五十五分，将近半夜，毛泽东号从哈尔滨机务段发车。管理局庄局长、政治部主任、机务处长、段长、张代表、支部书记、工会主任以及机务段好多同志都来送行。灯光明亮，照耀着欢笑鼓舞的人们，站台上一片喜气洋洋！
    “把负责制推广到全中国！”
    “祝你们胜利！”
    “回答大家的希望！”
    机车开动了，喷吐着浓烟，穿过睛朗的夜，隆隆地，隆隆地，逐渐由慢而快，由近而远。它油光明亮，它带着温暖和力量，它飞驰前进了！
    深夜里，欢送人们的手的树林，远远地掉在了后边。……
    一路经过长春、沈阳、锦州、山海关、天津等大城市和许多车站，工人们、学生们、妇女们，成群结队的欢迎欢送；报社记者来采访；摄影记者来照像；各局各段各站的首长干部来慰问；说不尽的愉快，说不尽的兴奋。……
    全车同志们更加认识了为人民立功的光荣，沿途不断地流着感动的眼泪。特别是老商和老郑，又高兴又惭愧。两个人私相约定，同下决心，要改正缺点，努力学习，积极工作，争取像开特快车一样的向大家赶上去。（附图片）
