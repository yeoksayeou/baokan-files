　　"Unite, Chinese and Korean People, to Defeat the American Aggressors!"
    Letter from Beijing Telecom Workers to the Korean People

Respected Korean People:

　　On the eve of the first anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, we, all the telecom workers in Beijing, China, express our highest enthusiasm in wishing the great friendship between the Chinese and Korean people a long life!

　　We extend our heartfelt respect and warm greetings to you, the entire Korean people, who are engaged in the just war against aggression. Every one of our workers is concerned about your victory. Because your victory is also the victory of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. You have shown unparalleled bravery in this war. This once again proves that people who love peace and fight for justice are invincible. We are confident that the heroic Korean people will defeat the American aggressors and strive for the independence and unification of their country.

　　While actively invading our Taiwan, the American aggressors are also wantonly invading our Northeast airspace with airplanes, killing and wounding our people, and destroying our buildings. All our people express infinite indignation at the barbarous crimes of the American aggressors. We are not afraid of the American aggressors, and we are confident that we will do a good job in our production and construction. All the telecom workers in Beijing have achieved great success in the past year. Each of us deeply knows that happiness must be created by our own strength. On the eve of our first National Day, we put forward the slogan "Fully launch a production competition!" to support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan and defeating the American aggressors with practical actions!

　　Let the Chinese and Korean people unite closely and work together to defeat the American aggressors!

　　Long live the Democratic People's Republic of Korea!

　　Long live General Kim Il-sung!

            All Beijing Telecom Workers
              September 27
