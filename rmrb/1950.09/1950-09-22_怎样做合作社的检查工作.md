　　How to Do Cooperative Inspection Work

    In order to systematically understand the situation of cooperatives in various regions and further collect materials on urban consumer cooperatives, rural supply and marketing cooperatives, and urban and rural handicraft production cooperatives, the Central Cooperative Affairs Administration recently transferred more than 40 cadres to form nine groups to inspect work in Northeast China, North China, and East China. Before they set off, they asked Soviet experts to give a talk on how to do cooperative inspection work. This talk is very helpful for the current inspection and improvement of cooperative work. Therefore, we have specially excerpted and published its main points for research and reference in various regions.
    —Editor

    At present, the inspection of grassroots cooperatives and joint cooperatives above the county level should be based on the draft Cooperative Law and various draft regulations discussed and revised at the First National Congress of Cooperative Workers in July this year. In this inspection work, we must clarify whether the organization of cooperatives in various regions conforms to the organizational principles stipulated in the above-mentioned draft; at the same time, we must also clarify whether the business operations of cooperatives in various regions conform to the tasks entrusted by the Party and the government and the congresses of representatives of members or members' meetings at all levels. There are difficulties in inspecting cooperative work at present, because the Cooperative Law and various regulations discussed and revised at the National Congress of Cooperative Workers are still drafts and do not have legal effect. However, despite this, for the convenience of inspection work, these drafts can still be used as temporary basis. Otherwise, it will be difficult to carry out inspection work systematically, and it will be difficult to systematically raise problems, collect materials, and solve problems. At the same time, using the draft as a basis for inspection work can also show whether the draft is suitable for the actual situation and requirements. If there are any inappropriate points, it can be reflected and suggestions for revision can be put forward.

    Inspection work can be carried out formally or informally. Formal inspection refers to the dispatch of special personnel by higher-level cooperatives to understand the general situation of various joint cooperatives or grassroots cooperatives, or to conduct inspections specifically on a particular issue; the results of such inspections should be recorded in detail and signed by both the inspectors and the inspected parties. Informal inspection is only for the needs of work, to understand the general situation of cooperatives in various regions, which does not require recording or signing by both parties. Our inspection this time is a formal inspection, so it is best to make records and have them signed by both the inspectors and the inspected parties to show responsibility.

    The content of cooperative inspection work should mainly include the following thirteen aspects:

    First, regarding organizational issues. There are many items that should be inspected on this issue. First of all, it is necessary to check clearly: the names of the cooperatives, the addresses, the names of the main responsible persons (such as the director, deputy director, chief accountant, etc.) and the length of their service in the cooperative, as well as the date of establishment of the cooperative, etc.; it is necessary to check the number of members, the areas where the members live, the occupations of the members, whether they joined the cooperative on a per capita basis or on a household basis; if it is a joint cooperative, it is necessary to check how many grassroots cooperatives are under it; if it is a cooperative engaged in agricultural production, it is necessary to check what kind of crops are produced; if it is a workers' consumer cooperative, it should be checked in which factory the members work, what products the factory they work in manufactures, and what their economic situation is.

    Secondly, it is necessary to check clearly the percentage of members in each region to the total population and the proportion of members from various classes.

    In addition, it should also be checked clearly: what are the differences between the current regulations of cooperatives in various regions and the draft regulations passed by this National Congress; how many shares and the amount of each share in each cooperative, whether there are account books to check whether members have invested in shares, whether there is a complete general ledger of shares, whether the names of investors and the amount of shares are recorded in the general ledger of shares, whether the members have signed, whether the accountant has signed; in the Soviet Union, due to neglecting this issue, corruption occurred, members paid share capital, but the cooperative cadre spent it. This series of problems must be checked one by one.

    Second, regarding the issue of democratic management system. On this issue, the following should be thoroughly inspected: whether cooperatives at all levels have the organization of the board of directors? Are the directors democratically elected or appointed by the higher authorities? How many of them regularly serve in the cooperative? What is the length of the term of each director, and are their compositions all working people? How is the schedule of the board of directors stipulated? Is there a regular reporting system to all members? Do the directors personally report to the members' meeting? How is the democratic situation of the members' meeting? Are the members concerned about the cooperative?

    Because the cooperative is the members' own economic organization, they must elect their own representatives to participate in management, and these representatives must be responsible to the members.

    Whether the grassroots cooperative or the joint cooperative has the organization of the supervisory board? What is the composition of the supervisors? Do they exercise their powers? - These issues have been stipulated in the draft regulations passed by this National Congress.

    Third, regarding business and technology, it should be checked whether the distribution of cooperative addresses is adapted to the convenience and needs of members? Are the types of goods complete? Can the supply of goods be timely or adapted to the seasonality?

    How is the equipment of the cooperative's stores? (Some stores do not have plaques, so that members cannot find them the second time after buying things once, which is not good.) Are the shelves and counters hygienic and clean?

    Whether the display of various commodities in the cooperative is rational - this issue should be given special attention. There are often some cooperatives that put matches, tea, and other items next to kerosene; some pile up various commodities randomly, and even they cannot easily find them. The storage of goods in cooperatives must be scientific and rational; it should be divided into several departments, such as the food department, the grocery department, etc., to display various types of goods separately; as for chemicals and commodities with special odors, they should be stored separately to avoid damaging other commodities.

    Whether the cooperative's utensils, such as weights and measures, are scientific, rational and clean? - Some cooperatives have scales full of dust, which is not good. In Soviet cooperative stores, the scales are placed on the counter so that customers can see clearly: the cooperative store buys and sells things most fairly, not even a gram is off. In China, attention should also be paid to this issue.

    In addition, has the cooperative paid enough attention to the issue of fire protection? - Cooperative property belongs to everyone and must be specially cherished. Although it is not possible to universally establish fire-fighting equipment, at least a bucket of water and a bag of sand should always be placed next to the stove.

    Fourth, in terms of purchasing and selling goods, it should be checked whether it is based on the needs of member consumers. Since members need to purchase goods from the cooperative every day, how the cooperative should purchase goods has become a very important issue. The cooperative should formulate a procurement plan according to the needs of the members and order goods from various parties according to the plan. Therefore, in this inspection work, it should be checked whether the procurement plans and order plans of each cooperative meet the needs of the members, pay attention to the daily inventory of each cooperative, and study whether there are any cold goods that are not needed by the members; at the same time, check whether the various plans have been completed. Since the purchase of goods is extremely important for the cooperative, it cannot be handed over to anyone casually; in the Soviet Union, the purchase of goods for grassroots cooperatives is done by the director or deputy director themselves. Because they are elected by the members, they can care for and be responsible for the cooperative.

    Of course, the needs of consumers should also be studied by joint cooperatives at all levels; but the main responsibility should be borne by the grassroots cooperatives. This work is not simple. The salespeople of the cooperative should register the quantity of goods purchased by the members, the types of goods purchased, and how many days they purchase once in their own notebooks; the people who purchase goods on behalf of the members should also regularly reflect the needs of the members to the cooperative; in addition, they should also solicit opinions from institutions and organizations in the area where the cooperative is located on demand at any time. Studying the needs of member consumers can obtain the best materials from the sales aspect. The quantity, quality, and types of goods sold in a certain period should be made into various statistical tables on a regular basis; for inventory, classified inventory lists should also be prepared. From these materials, it can be seen which goods are easy to sell and which goods are difficult to sell. Based on the above-mentioned materials and the inventory of goods in the cooperative, after research and discussion, annual, quarterly, and monthly procurement plans are prepared. These plans should not only stipulate the types and quantities of goods to be purchased, but also stipulate the time of arrival of the goods and a certain amount of goods to be prepared. After these plans are formulated, they should be submitted to the members' activists' meeting for discussion and revision to make the final procurement plan. Studying consumer demand and using it to make procurement plans is one of the basic tasks of cooperatives, especially grassroots cooperatives.

    The main source of goods for grassroots cooperatives is the county joint cooperative in rural areas and the municipal joint cooperative in urban areas; the second source is state-owned companies. In addition, when there are special needs, goods can also be purchased from private merchants; of course, this is only done when it is unavoidable. The grassroots cooperative should regularly make various comparison tables according to the quantity, quality and types of goods supplied by the three parties (i.e. the joint cooperative, state-owned companies, and private merchants). The grassroots cooperative should also adopt the contract method when ordering goods from the county or city joint cooperative; the goods supplied by the joint cooperative should also be reasonably selected, and those that do not meet the requirements of the grassroots cooperative should not be accepted. Joint cooperatives at all levels should plan and carry out their own procurement on a monthly or weekly basis according to the requirements of the order plans proposed by the grassroots cooperatives.

    Fifth, on the calculation of commodity turnover rate. The commodity turnover rate is to find the average number of days required for each turnover of commodities and the number of turnovers in a specific period. It can be obtained according to the following formula:

    Commodity turnover rate (days) = Average inventory (calculated at cost price) × Number of days in a specific period /
    Total cost of sales for the entire period

    For example: Suppose: (1) the second quarter of 1950 is a specific period;
    (2) the inventory on March 31, 1950 (i.e. the end of the first quarter), April 30,
    31st, May and 30th, June are 20,000 yuan, 24,000 yuan, 27,000 yuan and 29,000 yuan respectively;
          Then: Average inventory = 20,000 yuan + 24,000 yuan + 2
            7,000 yuan + 29,000 yuan / 4 =
            100,000 / 4 yuan = 25,000 yuan
          Suppose again: (3) the total cost of sales in the second quarter of 1950 is 150,000 yuan.
          Then: Commodity turnover rate (days) = 25,000 × 90 days (three months calculated according to
              90 days) / 150,000 = 15 days
          Commodity turnover rate (times) = 90 (total number of days in a specific period) / 15
          (Number of days per turnover) = 6 times

    That is, it turns over once every 15 days, and a total of 6 times in the second quarter.

    The total cost of sales can be calculated based on retail prices or wholesale prices; but in the same calculation formula, the inventory price must use the same standard as the sales price, and two standards cannot be mixed at the same time.

    Accelerating commodity turnover is a big struggle in the Soviet Union; the faster the commodity turnover, the lower the cost and the more reasonable profit can be obtained.

    The commodity turnover rate is actually almost equal to the capital turnover rate in cooperatives without a lot of cash deposits. Capital can be divided into two types: one is basic capital, also known as fixed capital, which does not directly participate in circulation; including buildings and all equipment, etc. The other is circulating capital, which directly participates in the commodity circulation process; such as cash and commodities, as well as packaging, transportation costs, etc. We must strive to minimize the ratio of fixed capital and maximize circulating capital. Therefore, do not always keep cash in the bank and vault, but let it move and turn around quickly. The speed of commodity turnover and capital circulation of each cooperative should be well checked.

    Sixth, the sales time and sales method of the cooperative should obey and serve the needs of the members, and should not require the members to accommodate the convenience of the cooperative. It is necessary to regularly study how to stipulate the sales time in order to better serve the members. In order to better serve the members, the cooperative can adopt the shoulder-carrying delivery system in rural areas. If members feel that it is inconvenient to come to the cooperative to buy goods, we should deliver the goods to their homes.

    In this regard, publicity work is also very important for the cooperative to increase sales. As soon as new goods arrive, advertisements should be posted; when conditions permit, various samples should also be displayed in the shop windows.

    Various issues regarding the sales time and method of the cooperative should also be thoroughly understood and checked.

    Seventh, on the issue of cash preservation. The cash of the cooperative should be deposited in the national bank in accordance with the regulations; the Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council has made correct instructions and regulations on this. The deposit date can be determined according to the distance between each cooperative's location and the bank and the traffic conditions. If the distance is close or the traffic is convenient, it may be deposited once a day; if the distance is far or the traffic conditions are poor, it can be deposited twice a week; if the distance is very far, the postal remittance method can be adopted. This is how it is done in the Soviet Union; we can also refer to it. It is also necessary to check the cash preservation issues of cooperatives in various regions at present.

    Eighth, on the issue of commodity loss. We do not have specific regulations on the commodity loss rate, but in general, there seem to be some quotas. Generally speaking, these quotas are too large. Commodity loss can be divided into two types: one is man-made loss. For example, someone transported 100 light bulbs, and broke 20 on the way due to carelessness; another example is that the biscuits in the cooperative were eaten by mice due to poor storage; there are many examples of this kind, all of which are caused by man-made negligence. In the Soviet Union, this kind of loss can rarely be reported to the cooperative, but it is not the end of the matter, but it must be carefully reviewed, recorded, and ordered the person in charge or the person in charge to compensate. The other is natural loss, that is, non-man-made loss. This is the inevitable loss that occurs in the process of transportation, storage, and sale of goods due to movement, wind, sun, climate, dryness, splitting, and evaporation. For example, soap becomes lighter due to drying, and gasoline decreases due to volatilization. These losses cannot be avoided by human power. However, there must still be quotas. These quotas have not yet been specifically stipulated in today's Chinese cooperatives; in the Soviet Union, they have been specifically stipulated. For example, the loss rate of flour for six days is 2.3 per thousand, vegetable oil in wooden barrels is 1 per thousand per month in summer, salt is 3 per thousand per month, 7 per thousand per half year, and 14 per thousand per year.

    Cooperative trade in the Soviet Union has 30 years of experience, and has good equipment for the preservation of goods, so it can achieve such a quota. Of course, it is probably impossible to require Chinese cooperatives to immediately reach the Soviet loss standard. However, it is still very necessary to appropriately stipulate the natural loss rate of commodities as early as possible for today's Chinese cooperatives.

    Ninth, on the issue of commodity transportation. Inspection work should pay attention to the issue of commodity transportation. The following abnormal situations often occur in commodity transportation: (1) not purchasing nearby, but blindly engaging in long-distance purchase and transportation, (2) transporting the same type of goods back and forth between two cities or two regions, (3) goods are transported from the factory to the joint cooperative, and then transferred from the joint cooperative to the grassroots cooperative, with too many levels of transportation. These abnormal situations often cause a large waste of manpower and materials, and should be checked and improved.

    Tenth, on the issue of income. In the inspection work, it should be checked how much the trade volume in the first half of this year is (wholesale volume in warehouses, retail volume in grassroots cooperatives). The so-called income amount refers to the difference between the purchase price and the selling price. As long as the difference or ratio between the purchase price and the selling price of the cooperative is checked, the income amount can be calculated.

    Eleventh, on the issue of circulation costs. It should be checked what percentage of the trade volume is circulation costs, and how much interest, rent, etc. account for in the circulation costs. If there is a budget for circulation costs, it should be checked which subjects are included in it.

    Generally speaking, circulation costs can be divided into three categories. The first is trade expenses, which include items such as commodity purchase expenses, transportation expenses, storage expenses, and sales expenses. The second category is the expenses for the purchase and promotion of agricultural products. The third category is other comprehensive expenses, including: wages (i.e. the salaries of the director and accountant, but not including the wages of the salesperson, because the salesperson's wages belong to trade expenses), rent, repair expenses for houses and appliances, depreciation expenses, office expenses, travel expenses, insurance expenses, expenses for the supervisory board, and interest expenses.

    According to the statistics of the Central Cooperative Union of the Soviet Union in 1940, the above three categories of circulation costs accounted for 10.1% of the retail trade volume in the Soviet Union.

    Twelfth, on the issue of profit. The so-called income in the tenth question above includes gross profit including taxes paid to the government, commissions to higher levels, and various circulation costs. Some cooperatives have high income, some have low income, and some even have no income. This is because some cooperatives have strong planning, some have poor planning, and some are blindly engaged in business. Income minus taxes, commissions, and circulation expenses is the net profit. This is the profit mentioned here. It is necessary for cooperatives to obtain legitimate and reasonable profits for their own existence and development. When inspecting cooperative work, it is necessary to check the balance sheet. If liabilities are found, it is necessary to ask clearly who the debt is owed to and why it is not repaid; if external debts are found, it is also necessary to ask why they have not been recovered. Here, it is also necessary to check whether the staffing of each cooperative is reasonable and whether the treatment of staff is appropriate.

    Thirteenth, on other issues. What is the relationship between the cooperative and the Party, government, and other agencies? What help have they given to the cooperative? What preferential treatment does the cooperative enjoy from the government? How does the higher-level cooperative help the lower-level cooperative? Has the cooperative established systems such as planned budgets? If these systems already exist, then how is the implementation of these systems, and how is the degree of completion? These issues should be well checked.

    Regarding the distribution of preferential treatment for imports, in the Soviet Union, 70% goes to the grassroots cooperative and 30% goes to the joint cooperative.

    The above are the thirteen aspects of inspecting cooperative work. Inspection work should be like photography, capturing all the large and small problems that currently exist in cooperatives in terms of organization, business, and leadership. At the same time, the person responsible for the inspection should, based on the above-mentioned draft Cooperative Law and various draft regulations, put forward positive suggestions and opinions on the problems they have discovered. This inspection work is a formal inspection and must have records. It is best to make several copies of these records, one for the cooperative, one for the National General Cooperative, and one or two for the local Party and government agencies, so that everyone can understand what problems currently exist in the cooperative, so as to study and gradually solve these problems.

　　怎样做合作社的检查工作
    中央合作事业管理局为了有系统地了解各地合作社的情况，进一步搜集城市消费合作社、农村供销合作社和城乡手工业生产合作社的材料，最近曾抽调四十多个干部，组成九个小组，分赴东北、华北及华东各地检查工作。在他们出发之前，曾请苏联专家作过一次关于怎样做合作社的检查工作的谈话。这一次谈话，对于目前检查与改进合作社工作很有帮助。因此，我们特将它的要点摘录发表，以供各地研究参考。
    ——编者
    在目前，检查各地基层合作社以及县以上的联合社的工作，都应以今年七月全国合作社工作者第一届代表会议所讨论修正的合作社法草案和各个章程草案为根据。在这一次的检查工作中，我们要弄清楚各地合作社的组织是否符合上述草案所规定的组织原则；同时我们也要弄清楚各地合作社的业务经营，是否符合党和政府以及各级社员代表大会或社员大会所赋予的任务。目前检查合作社工作是有困难的，因为这次全国合作社工作者代表会议所讨论修正的合作社法和各种章程，都还是一些草案，还没有法律上的效力。但尽管如此，为了检查工作的便利，仍可将这些草案作为临时的根据。不然，就会使检查工作难于系统地进行，很难系统地提出问题，搜集材料和解决问题。同时以草案做根据来检查工作，也可看出草案是否适合实际情况和要求，如有不妥之处，也可反映上来，提出修正意见。
    检查工作可以正式的进行，也可非正式的进行。正式的检查，就是由上级社派专人到各联合社或基层社了解一般情况，或专对某一特殊问题进行检查；将这种检查的结果，作出详细的记录，并由检查者与被检查者双方负责签字。非正式的检查则只是为了工作上的需要，对各地合作社作一般情况的了解，这就不需要记录或双方签字。我们这次的检查，就是一次正式的检查，因此，最好都能做记录，并由检查者与被检查者双方签字，以示负责。
    合作社检查工作的内容，主要应当包括下列十三个方面的问题：
    第一、关于组织问题。在这个问题上，应当检查的项目很多。首先要检查清楚：各合作社的名称、社址、主要负责人（如主任、副主任、会计主任等）的姓名及其在社服务年限，以及合作社成立的年月日等；要查清社员人数、社员居住的区域、社员的职业、他们是以人口为单位入社的抑是以户口为单位入社的；如果是联合社，则要查清它下面有多少基层社；如果是从事农业生产的合作社，则要查明究竟生产何种作物；如果是工人消费社，则应查明其社员在那个工厂工作，他们工作的工厂是制造什么产品的，他们的经济情况怎样等。
    其次要检查清楚的是，各地社员数占总人口数的百分比，各阶层的社员成份的比例。
    此外还应检查清楚：各地合作社现行章程与此次全国合作会议通过的章程草案有那些不同；各社的社股数和股金额多少，社员入股是否有账簿可查，是否有完备的股金总账，在股金总账中是否记明入股人姓名和股金数额，社员自己是否签过字，合作社已否发给社员证，会计是否签过字，在苏联曾由于忽视这一问题，而发生过贪污的现象，社员缴了股金、给社干花掉了。这一系列的问题，都要一一检查清楚。
    第二、关于民主管理制度问题。在这一问题上应当深入检查的有：各级合作社有无理事会的组织？各理事是民主选举的呢还是上级指派的？其中有几名经常在社内服务？各理事的任期长短如何，其成份是否都是劳动人民？理事会的会期怎样规定？对全体社员的报告制度是否定期举行？理事们是否亲自向社员大会作报告？社员大会的民主情况如何？社员对合作社关心与否？
    因为合作社是社员自己的经济组织，必须选出自己的代表参加管理，这些代表又必须向社员负责。
    基层合作社或联合社有无监事会的组织？监事成份如何？是否执行其职权？——这些问题在此次全国合作会议所通过的章程草案中已经有了规定。
    第三，关于经营技术方面，应当检查的是合作社地址的分布是否适应社员的便利与需要？商品种类是否齐全？商品供给能不能及时或是不是适应季节性？
    合作社的门市部的设备如何？（有的门市部没有挂牌匾，使社员买过一次东西之后，第二次再也找不到了，这是不好的。）货架、柜台是否卫生清洁？
    合作社各种商品的陈列是否合理化，——这个问题应该加以特别注意。常有一些合作社，把火柴、茶叶等物品放在煤油旁边；有的把各种商品乱堆在一起，甚至连自己也不容易找到。合作社存放商品必须科学化，合理化；应当分做几个部，例如食品部，杂货部……等，分别陈列各类商品；至于化学品及有特别气味的商品，则应单独存放，以免损坏其他商品。
    合作社的用具，如度量衡等，是否科学合理和清洁？——有的合作社秤上满是尘土，这就不好。苏联合作商店，用的秤都是放在柜台上的，以便使顾主们能够看清楚：合作商店买卖东西是最公道的，连一个格兰姆亦不差。在中国也应提起对这一问题的注意。
    此外，合作社对于消防的问题是否已有足够注意？——合作社财产是大家的，必须特别加以爱护。虽然不能普遍地建立起消防设备，但至少应做到在火炉旁边要经常放桶水，放包沙。
    第四，在购销货物方面，应当检查是否根据社员消费者的需要。由于社员每天需要向合作社购货，因此合作社应如何采购商品，就成为一个极重要的问题。合作社应根据社员的需求来制订采购计划，并按计划向各方面定货。因此，在这次检查工作中，应检查各社的采购计划和定货计划是否符合社员需要，要注意各社每天的存货量，研究其中有没有不为社员所需的冷货；同时要检查各种计划已否完成。由于购货工作对于合作社极为重要，因此不能随便交给任何人办理；在苏联，基层社的购货工作，是由主任或副主任自己来做的。因为他们是社员选举出来的，能够对合作社关心负责。
    当然，对消费者的需要问题，各级联合社亦应该研究；但主要的应由基层社负责。这个工作不简单。合作社的售货员应将社员的购货数量、购货种类以及几天购一次等情形登记在自己的小本子上；代理社员购货的人，亦应经常地将社员的需要反映到合作社里来；此外，还应随时征求合作社所在区域内的机关、团体关于需求的意见。研究社员消费者的需要，可以从售货方面取得最好的材料。应当经常地将一定期间内所销售出去的商品数量，质量与种类，作出各种统计表；对于存货，亦应编制分类的存货清单。从这些材料中可以看出：那些货物好销，那些货物难卖。根据以上各方面的材料及本社货品的盘存，经过研究讨论，编制年度、季度、月度的采购计划。在这些计划中不但要规定拟购货品的种类和数量，而且要规定货品到达的时间和一定的货品准备量。这些计划拟定后，应提交社员积极分子大会讨论修正，作出最后的采购计划。研究消费者的需求，并借以作出采购计划，这是合作社特别是基层社的基本任务之一。
    基层社商品的主要来源，在农村里是由县联社供给，在城市里是由市联社供给；其次的来源则是国营公司。此外，有特殊需要时，亦可以向私商进货；当然这是在不得已的情形下才这样做的。基层社应按照三方面（即联合社、国营公司和私商）所供给的商品数量、质量与种类，定期作出各种比较表。基层社向县或市的联合社订货，也要采用合同的方式；对联合社所供给的商品亦应当经过合理的选择，不合基层社要求的就不要。各级联合社则应根据基层社所提出的订货计划的要求，按月或按周地来计划和进行自己的进货。
    第五，关于商品周转率的计算问题。商品周转率是求商品每周转一次平均所需的日数和特定期间所周转的次数。可按左列公式求得：
    商品周转率（日数）＝平均存货量（按成本价格计）×特定期间的日数／
    全期销货成本总额
    例如：设：（一）一九五○年第二季度为特定期间；
    （二）一九五○年三月三十一日（即第一季度末日）、四月三
          十日、五月三十一日及六月三十日之存货量各为二万元
          、二万四千元、二万七千元及二万九千元；
          则：平均存货量＝２０，０００元＋２４，０００元＋２
            ７，０００元＋２９，０００元／４＝
            １００，０００／４元＝２５，０００元
          又设：（三）一九五○年第二季度销货成本总额为十五万元。
          则：商品周转率（日数）＝２５，０００×９０日（三个月按      
              ９０日计）／１５０，０００＝１５日
          商品周转率（次数）＝９０（特定期间总日数）／１５
          （每次周转日数）＝６次
    亦即每隔十五日周转一次，第二季度中共周转六次。
    计算销货成本总额，可以零售价格或批发价格为标准；但在同一计算式中，存货价格必须与销货价格采用同一标准，不能同时混用两种标准。
    加速商品周转率在苏联是一个很大的斗争；商品周转愈速，则愈能降低成本，愈能获得合理利润。
    商品周转率在没有很多现金存款的合作社中实际就差不多等于资金流通率。资金可分二种：一种是基本金，亦称固定资金，即不直接参加流通的资金；包括建筑物及一切设备等。另一种是流通资金，即直接参加商品流通过程的资金；如现金和商品，以及包装、运输费用等是。我们要争取使固定资金的比率尽量缩小，流通资金尽量扩大。因此不要老把现金存在银行和库箱里死放着，而要使它活动起来，迅速周转起来。对于各社商品周转资金流通的迟速，均应很好地加以检查。
    第六、关于合作社的售货时间与售货方式，都应服从并服务于社员的需要，而不应要求社员迁就合作社方便。要经常研究怎样规定售货时间，才能更多地为社员服务。合作社为了更好地为社员服务，在农村中可以采用肩挑送货制的方式。如社员感到来合作社买货不方便，我们就应把货物送到他们家里去。
    在这一方面，合作社为增加售货量，宣传工作亦很重要。新货一到，就应张贴广告；在条件许可时，还应将各种货样陈列在货窗里。
    对于合作社售货时间与方式上的各个问题，亦应深入了解与检查。
    第七、关于现金保存的问题。合作社的现金，应一律存入国家银行；政务院财经委员会已对此做了正确的指示和规定。存款的日期，可视各社所在地与银行距离的远近以及交通条件等情况而定。距离近或交通便利的，不妨每天存一次；距离较远或交通条件较差的，则可一周存两次；若距离很远，则可采用邮汇的办法。在苏联是这样做的；我们亦可参考办理。对于目前各地合作社的现金保存问题，亦有检查一下的必要。
    第八、关于商品损耗问题。商品损耗率我们还没有具体的规定，但大体上似乎亦有了些定额。一般说来这些定额是太大的。商品损耗可分两种：一种是人为的损耗。如有人运了一百个灯泡，因不小心，途中打破了二十个；又如合作社里的饼干，因保藏不好，以致被耗子吃了许多；诸如此类的例子很多，都是由于人为的过失而发生的。在苏联这种损耗是很少能向合作社报账的，但也不是不了了之，而要经过详细审查，作出记录，着令负责人或经手人赔偿。另一种是自然损耗，亦即非人为的损耗。这是货物在运输、保管和出售的过程中，因为移动、风吹、日晒、气候、燥湿、割裂和蒸发等关系所发生的不可免的损耗。如肥皂因干燥而减轻，汽油因挥发而减少，这些损耗不是人力所能以避免的。但，仍须要有定额。这些定额，在今天中国的合作社中还没有具体规定；在苏联，则已具体规定了，例如面粉六天的损耗率为千分之二点三，木桶装植物油夏天一个月为千分之一，盐一个月为千分之三，半年为千分之七，一年为千分之十四。
    合作社贸易在苏联已有三十来年的经验，对商品的保藏已有很好的设备，因此，已能做到这样定额。当然目前要求中国的合作社马上达到苏联的损耗标准，那恐怕是不可能的。但是，对商品的自然损耗率及早地适当地加以规定，对于今天中国的合作社却仍是十分必要的。
    第九、关于商品运输问题。检查工作要注意商品的运输问题。在商品运输中往往发生下列几种不正常的情况：（一）不就近采购，而盲目从事远距离购运，（二）在两个城市或两地区间，往返运输同一类商品，（三）商品从工厂运到联合社，从联合社再转运到基层社，运输环节层次过多。这些不正常情况，往往造成人力物力的大量浪费，应当加以检查和改进。
    第十、关于收益问题。在检查工作中，要查明今年上半年的贸易额（在货栈为批发额，在基层社则为零售额）多少。所谓收益额，即指买价与卖价间的差额，只要查明合作社的采购价格和销售价格的差数或比例之后，就可以算出收益额。
    第十一、关于流通费问题。要查明流通费对于贸易额的百分比，在流通费中，利息、房租……等又各占多少。流通费如果有预算，则要检查其中包括那几个科目。
    一般说来，流通费约可分为三大类。第一是贸易费用，即包括商品的采购费用、运输费用、保管费用、和销售费用等项目。第二类是农产品的收购和推销等费用。第三类是其他综合性的费用，其中包括：工资（即主任、会计之薪资，但不包括售货员的工资，因售货员的工资是属于贸易费用的）、租金、房屋用具之修理费、折旧费、办公费、出差费、保险费、监事会的费用以及利息费用等。
    一九四○年据苏联中央合作联盟的统计，在苏联以上三类流通费占零售贸易额的百分之十点一。
    第十二、关于利润问题。在上述第十个问题中所谓收益，是包括向政府纳税及向上级提成等以及各项流通费在内的毛利。有的合作社收益高，有的收益低，而有的甚至没有收益，这是由于有的合作社计划性强，有的计划性差，而有的却是盲目地经营业务。收益中除去纳税、提成及流通费用之外，剩下的便是纯利。这就是这里所说的利润。合作社为了自己的存在与发展，获取正当合理的利润，是必要的。在检查合作社工作时，一定要检查资产负债表。如发现有负债，就要问清楚负谁的债，为什么不偿还；若发现有外欠，亦要问明白为什么没有收回。在这里还要顺便检查一下各社的编制是否合理，工作人员的待遇是否适当等。
    第十三、关于其他问题。合作社与党政及其他机关的关系如何？他们曾给合作社以什么帮助？合作社享受政府什么优待？上级社对下级社的帮助怎样？合作社已否建立起计划预算等制度？如果已有这些制度，那么对这些制度的执行情形怎样，完成的程度如何？这些问题都要很好的检查一下。
    关于进货优待的分配问题，在苏联是百分之七十归基层社，百分之三十归联合社。
    以上就是检查合作社工作的十三个方面的问题。检查工作应当好像摄影一样，把目前合作社在组织业务和领导等各方面存在着的大大小小问题都摄下来。同时，负责检查的人，要根据上述合作社法草案及各种章程草案，提出对于其所发现的问题之积极的建议和意见。这次检查工作是正式检查，要有记录。最好能将这些记录复写数份，社里留一份，全国总社要一份，并送当地党政机关一二份，使大家都了解目前合作社存在些什么问题，以便研究并逐步解决这些问题。
