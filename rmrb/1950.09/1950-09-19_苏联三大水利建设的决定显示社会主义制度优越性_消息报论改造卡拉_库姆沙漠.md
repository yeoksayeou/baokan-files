Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th (TASS): *Izvestia* published an article on the 15th by the famous Soviet power engineer G.M. Krzhizhanovsky, discussing the planned construction of the Turkmen Main Canal to transform the Kara-Kum Desert in Soviet Central Asia, stating: Eighty percent of the land in the Turkmen Republic is the Kara-Kum Desert. After the construction of the Turkmen Main Canal and the implementation of water diversion irrigation, the barren desert will be transformed into fertile fields. The agricultural production of each hectare of irrigated land in this area will be four to five times higher than that of the central zone of the Soviet Union, because two harvests can be reaped each year here. The cotton harvest will double that of the main cotton-producing areas of the Soviet Union, and the most valuable cotton seeds will grow. The cultivation of subtropical plants will obtain limitless development, especially lemons and tangerines, fine varieties of fruits and grapes, etc. At the same time, due to the warm climate and abundant sunshine, livestock can graze on lush pastures almost all year round, and pasture grass can be harvested three or four times a year, and animal husbandry will have broad prospects for development.

The article continued: Power is one of the main conditions for transforming the Kara-Kum Desert. Thousands of powerful pumps and motors will be installed in the area for water extraction. New Soviet agricultural machines, such as electric tractors, cotton pickers, rice harvesters, and special motors for harvesting other industrial crops, will be widely used. Hydropower stations and thermal power stations will be combined into a powerful power system to supply electricity to vast farms and plantations. Motors and other electrical equipment will ensure the continuous improvement of agricultural productivity.

The article finally emphasized: Capitalist countries cannot solve the problem of desert irrigation on the same scale. Deserts account for more than 40 percent of all land in the United States. However, in the past 100 years, Americans have only conquered 8 million hectares of desert land. Now, the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on the three major water conservancy projects on the Volga River and in Turkmenistan stipulates that 22 million hectares of land, mainly in desert areas, will be irrigated in just seven years. This demonstrates the infinite superiority of the socialist system.

　　苏联三大水利建设的决定显示社会主义制度优越性
    消息报论改造卡拉·库姆沙漠
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：十五日的消息报发表苏联著名动力工程师克罗日然诺夫斯基所撰专文，论述计划修建的土库曼大运河将改造苏联中亚细亚的卡拉·库姆沙漠称：土库曼共和国的百分之八十的土地是卡拉·库姆沙漠。建造土库曼大运河并实行引水灌溉之后，将使不毛的沙漠变成肥沃的田野。这一地区每一公顷的灌溉土地，农业生产量将比苏联中央地带高出四倍至五倍，因为这里每年可以收获两次。棉花的收获量将比苏联的主要产棉区增加一倍，最有价值的棉种将生长起来。亚热带植物的栽植工作将获得无限的发展，尤其是柠檬和橘柑，佳种的水果与葡萄等。同时，由于气候温暖与阳光充足，牲畜几乎可以终年在肥美的草场上牧放，牧草每年可收割三四次，牧畜业将有广阔的发展前途。
    该文继称：动力是改造卡拉·库姆沙漠的主要条件之一。该地区将设置数千具强大的帮浦和电动机以进行汲水。苏联新式的农业机器，如电气拖拉机，采棉、割稻以及收割其他工业作物用的特殊电机，均将广泛加以采用。水力发电站以及热力发电站将结合成为一个强大的动力体系，以电力供给广大的农场和种植园等。电动机和其他电气设备，将确保不断提高农业生产的生产率。
    该文最后强调指出：资本主义国家是不能以同样的规模来解决沙漠的灌溉问题的。美国的沙漠约占全部土地的百分之四十以上。但是，一百年来，美国人只征服了八百万公顷的沙漠土地。现在苏联部长会议关于在伏尔加河及土库曼进行三大水利建设的决定，规定仅在七年内就要在主要是沙漠的地区灌溉二千二百万公顷的土地。这就显示了社会主义制度的无限优越性。
