Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 23rd—The American imperialist air force, which is invading Korea, once again invaded the airspace of Andong City and Kuandian County in Liaodong Province, Northeast China, on the 22nd, and dropped bombs in Andong City, wounding three of our compatriots. This serious incident is a continuation of the American imperialist air force's invasion of Ji'an, Linjiang, Andong, and Kuandian in Liaodong Province, China at the end of August. The details of the incident are as follows: At 10:01 PM on the 22nd, an American plane intruded into the airspace over Lagu Shao Village in Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, China, from the direction of Korea, and then flew south. At 10:15 PM on the same day, an American plane intruded into the airspace over Andong City from the northeast, and simultaneously dropped twelve bombs in the Zhen'an District, Zhen'an Road, and near Yiwei Road in the northeastern suburbs of the city. Three of our compatriots (one of whom was a child) were wounded by the bombing. The glass of most houses within a 500-meter radius was shattered. The plane flew south at 10:19 PM.

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, 23rd—The Chinese workers and fishermen who were wounded by American planes on the 27th and 29th of last month have, after active treatment by the local People's Government, mostly recovered and have been successively discharged from the hospital. Among the eighteen workers recuperating in the Liaodong Provincial Hospital, following the discharge of Fang Shirong, Jiao Chuan'yu, Wang Guiren, Fu Yongjun and four others, Dong Chengde, Tang Guiren, Xiu Shizong, Zhang Desheng, Wu Longchen and five others have been successively discharged. They were all in high spirits when they were discharged from the hospital, and expressed their gratitude to the People's Government and people from all walks of life for their care, and expressed that they would work actively to avenge their blood debt. Among the nine wounded still in the hospital, Li Rongfa, Ju Dezhong, and Yu Fenghou and three others are expected to be discharged by the end of this month. Seriously injured worker Tan Dexiang is out of danger. Once the wound on his left chest has healed, the hospital plans to perform surgery to remove the bullet from his left shoulder. Among the other wounded, Sun Jinglu and Yin Dechang can be discharged after a month, while Yu Zeren, Qu Chuntian, and Wang Xuexin will require two months of treatment due to small shrapnel in their wounds.

The treatment of the seven fishermen injured on the Yalu River is also progressing extremely well. Li Dianchen and Liang Zhongde have been discharged one after another. Yang Decheng, Chen Shengkui, Jia Yufa, and Zhang Yunfu, who are being treated at the Andong Municipal Hospital, are nearing recovery and will be discharged soon.

    【新华社安东二十三日电】侵略朝鲜的美帝国主义空军，二十二日又向我国东北辽东省安东市、宽甸县等地侵袭，并在安东市投掷炸弹，炸伤我国同胞三人。这一严重事件，是美帝国主义空军八月底侵袭我国辽东省辑安、临江、安东、宽甸等地事件的继续发展。事件经过如下：二十二日夜间十时零一分，有美国飞机一架自朝鲜方向侵入我国辽东省宽甸县拉古哨村上空，随即向南方飞去。同日夜间十时十五分，美国飞机一架自东北方向侵入安东市上空，在该市东北郊区镇安区、镇安路与一纬路附近同时投弹十二枚。我国同胞三人（其中一个是儿童）被炸伤。周围五百米以内的房屋玻璃大部震碎。该飞机于十时十九分向南方飞去。
    【新华社安东二十三日电】上月二十七、二十九两日被美机扫射受伤的我国工人和渔夫，经当地人民政府积极救治，伤势大部好转，并已陆续出院。在辽东省立医院养伤的十八名工人中，继房世荣、焦传玉、王桂仁、傅永俊等四人之后陆续出院者，有董成德、唐桂仁、修世宗、张德生、吴隆臣等五人。他们出院时都精神焕发，对人民政府及各界人民对他们的关怀非常感谢，并表示要以积极工作来讨还血债。现留院九名伤员中，尚有李荣发、鞠德忠、于凤厚等三人可于本月底出院。重伤工人谭德祥已脱离危险期，一俟左胸创口医治复原，院方即拟施行手术，自左肩取出弹头。其他伤员除孙景禄、尹德昌一个月后可以出院外，于泽仁，曲春田、王学信等因创口内有小弹片，尚须经两个月治疗。
    在鸭绿江面受伤的七名渔夫，治疗情况亦极良好。已有李殿臣、梁忠德二人先后出院。在安东市立医院治疗之杨德诚、陈盛奎、贾玉发、张云福等四人伤口即将痊愈，不久即可出院。重伤之张云芝，已度过危险期，体温下降，右上肢肿毒亦已消除。
