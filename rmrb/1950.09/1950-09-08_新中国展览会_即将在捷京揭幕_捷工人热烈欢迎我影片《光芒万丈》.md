      Czech Workers Warmly Welcome Our Film "Boundless Radiance"
    [Prague Dispatch] The New China Exhibition, invited by the Czechoslovak government to exhibit in Czechoslovakia, has now entered the preparation stage. An exhibition committee has been formed, with Professor Procházka, chairman of the Czech-China Association, exhibition design expert Rossmann, and Dr. Hertlík of the Oriental Department of the Ministry of Culture participating from the Czech side, and Comrades Hua Junwu and Zou Difan participating from the Chinese side to jointly plan the exhibition work. It has been decided that the New China Exhibition will officially open here on September 21st and close on October 21st. During the exhibition, the Czechoslovak government will systematically organize people from all over the country to visit Prague. In addition to exhibiting various pictures, woodcut New Year paintings, antiques, handicrafts, and various published books from New China, it is also planned to screen New China films in the evenings, and hold various evening parties, give lectures, recite Chinese poems, and play Chinese music records. The exhibition venue is in the House of Czech Artists, located in the center of Prague, which is a building very suitable for exhibitions.
    [Another Dispatch] In early August, workers' film festivals were held successively in major industrial cities throughout Czechoslovakia. The government screened various films from different countries participating in international film competitions in various places on tour. Film delegations composed of film representatives from various countries also went to various places to participate in the opening ceremonies of the film festivals and visited local factories, receiving a warm welcome from the workers. The opening ceremony of the Gottwaldov City Workers' Film Festival on August 7th was held in an open-air cinema that could accommodate 20,000 people. National flags of various countries were hung on the tall poles on both sides of the huge screen, which was about four or five zhang high. At the opening, local youth league members sang the Chinese national anthem in Chinese. After the enthusiastic applause of the masses for the speech by Yu Min, the Chinese film representative, the Chinese film "Boundless Radiance" was immediately screened. When the masses saw in the film the enthusiasm of Chinese workers who fearlessly participated in the construction of the motherland and overcame difficulties, enthusiastic applause and cheers burst forth from time to time. The workers saw the actual life of Chinese workers and held a symposium to discuss and express their feelings.
