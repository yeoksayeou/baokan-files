    US Diplomat Threatens to Re-arm Japan
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch] American occupiers are intensifying their plunder of war materials in Japan, making the Japanese economy directly serve the American war of aggression. According to a report by Kyodo News Agency, Tokyo, on the 2nd: According to a survey by the Yoshida government's Economic Stabilization Board, the total amount of "special procurement" orders for military supplies placed by the United States in Japan since the start of the American invasion of Korea up to August 28, amounted to 14.4 billion yen (equivalent to 40 million US dollars). Trucks accounted for the largest proportion of the orders, totaling 6,200 vehicles, accounting for one-third of the total order amount. Other orders, such as for burlap sacks, locomotives, and railroad ties, were all above one million US dollars.
    In order to supply the "special needs" of its American master, the Yoshida government decided at a meeting on the 1st to add more than 51.93 million US dollars to the foreign exchange budget for July to September, bringing the total foreign exchange budget for the three months to 310 million US dollars. Kyodo News Agency revealed that the additional foreign exchange budget will be used to increase the import of strong coking coal, iron sand, and raw rubber and other war materials.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch] American diplomatic officials admitted that the United States will openly re-arm Japan. According to a United Press report from Washington: American diplomatic officials declared on the 2nd: Regarding the re-arming of Japan, the American position is: "In favor of (Japan's) rearmament without restrictions after the conclusion of the peace treaty." The American attitude is: "The peace conference should not have provisions that Japan must remain disarmed." The cable revealed that the United States is using "the Korean War and all the problems involved" as an excuse to force its puppet states to accept the American proposition to re-arm Japan.

    美外交官扬言将重新武装日本
    【新华社六日讯】美国占领者正在日本加紧掠夺战争物资，使日本经济直接为美国侵略战争服务。据共同社东京二日讯：根据吉田政府经济安定本部的调查，自美国发动侵略朝鲜战争以来，至八月二十八日为止的短期间内，美国在日本采购军需品的“特别需要”订货额，总计已达一百四十四亿日元（按合四千万美元）。订货中以卡车为大宗，共计达六千二百辆，占全部订货额的三分之一。其他如麻袋、机车、枕木等订货额均在一百万美元以上。
    吉田政府为了供应其美国主子的“特别需要”，在一日的会议中决定七月至九月的外汇预算追加五千一百九十三万余美元，使三个月的外汇预算总额增至三亿一千万美元。共同社透露，追加的外汇预算将用来增加输入强力粘结煤、铁砂以及生橡胶等战争物资。
    【新华社六日讯】美国外交官员承认美国将公开重新武装日本。据合众社华盛顿讯：美国外交界官员二日宣称：关于重新武装日本，美国的主张是：“赞成在和约缔结后、对（日本）重整军备，不加限制”，美国的态度是：对日“和会中不应该有日本必须保持无武装状态的规定”。该电透露，美国正以“朝鲜战争及其涉及的一切问题”为借口，强迫其仆从国家接受美国重新武装日本的主张。
