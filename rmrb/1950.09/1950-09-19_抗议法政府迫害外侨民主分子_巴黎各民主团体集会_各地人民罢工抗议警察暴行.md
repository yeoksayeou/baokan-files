    [Xinhua News Agency, 17th] According to TASS: On the 12th, democratic groups in Paris and its suburbs held a mass rally at the Maison de la Mutualité in Paris to protest the police brutality employed by the French government in its recent expulsion of foreign democratic elements. Jourdain, president of the "People's Aid Society," and Dillon, a member of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, delivered speeches at the meeting. Dillon emphasized the inviolable right to fight for freedom and peace and called for the unification of all forces to carry out this struggle. The assembly unanimously passed a resolution denouncing the fascist methods of the government.
    In order to protest the persecution of foreign democratic elements residing in France, a rally was also held in the town of Courteuil in the Seine-et-Oise province. Workers in many places went on strike to protest, for example, in the Moselle province, many coal miners stopped working.
    The Gaullist weekly "Le Rouge et le Noir" acknowledged when reporting on the arrests that Titoists residing in France had assisted the actions of the Police Prefecture. L'Humanité pointed out that Tito's henchmen in France were helping the French police and working for them in democratic organizations.

    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社讯：巴黎及近郊各民主团体于十二日在巴黎法格朗大厦举行群众大会，抗议法国政府最近驱逐外侨民主分子所采取的警察暴行。“人民援助会”会长儒丹及法国共产党中央委员狄隆等在会上发表了演说。狄隆强调为自由与和平而斗争的不可侵犯的权利，号召团结一切力量来进行这一斗争。大会一致通过决议斥责政府的法西斯手段。
    为抗议迫害侨居法国的外国民主分子，塞纳——瓦斯省的珂戎忒伊城也举行了大会。许多地方的工人罢工抗议，例如摩塞尔省，就有很多煤矿工人停止工作。
    戴高乐派的《红与黑》周刊报道逮捕情况时，承认住在法国的铁托分子曾协助警察总监部的行动。人道报指出，铁托在法国的爪牙帮助法国警察，在民主组织里替他们办事。
