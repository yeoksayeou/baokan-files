    Twenty-four. The First Priority is to Correct Past Shortcomings

　　Guo Shude went to see the old hero to discuss future work plans.

　　The old hero panicked! Although the work had been good before, it had never been well planned. After a long while, he said:

　　"I don't know how to make plans. Comrade Guo, you take charge. Whatever plan you make is fine."

　　Guo Shude said:

　　"You are the leader on the locomotive, so of course you should lead everyone to make the plan. Although I have participated in planning on the Zhu De Locomotive, I don't know much either. But I can help you. Those who know more contribute more, and those who know less contribute less."

　　As a result, the three-month work plan to prepare for winter transportation was finalized after discussion and agreement by everyone (those who disagreed did not clearly express their opposition). There was a lot of content, some of which were plans, and some were like covenants, totaling thirteen points: to conserve materials (including saving coal and oil, etc.) to reduce costs; to achieve 6,000 kilometers of safe travel each month; to overcome the cold winter without complaining; never to engage in smuggling; to intensify political and technical studies and cultivate a new work ethic; to unite in friendship and help each other, and so on.

　　After the old hero announced this to everyone, Guo Shude continued:

　　"In my opinion, the first and last points are the most important!"

　　The first point is: to ensure the correction of past shortcomings!

　　The last point is: to hold a group meeting every week to review the progress of work and conduct criticism.

　　"Only by first achieving these two points can we achieve the others one by one and truly strive to be a model locomotive for the entire section!" At the end, he asked:

　　"Does everyone have confidence?"

　　The young people all answered "Yes!" Old Shang and Old Zheng didn't say "Yes," but they didn't oppose it as before.

　　Old hero Li Yong began to feel that Guo was stronger than him and more capable. "I must learn from him well and ask him for more help." He thought, "The meetings I led before were never as good as the one today!..."

　　He seemed to have new confidence in the future of his work.

　　But after the new plan had been implemented for only a few days, Zheng Dugong argued with the old hero again. Zheng Dugong’s attitude was: I’m too embarrassed to argue with Guo Shude for now, but I know you, old hero!

　　The old hero couldn't take it anymore and went to Guo Shude and said:

　　"It still doesn't work. Let's change people. I can't lead the old sage!"

　　Guo Shude said:

　　"Old hero, don't worry. Didn't we stipulate that there would be group meetings? We'll review Old Zheng's matter at the group meeting the day after tomorrow." He paused, looked at Li Yong, and then said:

　　"However, do you also have some shortcomings in this matter? You'd better think about it and talk about it that day."

　　"Me?..."

　　"Yes, you! As long as you make a self-criticism at the meeting first, I guarantee the group meeting will be even better."

　　The old hero didn't speak for a while, looking at Guo Shude. Guo Shude told him to think about it and then went to Zheng Dugong.

　　After chatting with Old Zheng for a while, they talked about his arguing with the old hero. Guo Shude said:

　　"He is the driver chief, and we should obey him. Besides, he has experience in his work, and we should respect him even more and learn from him."

　　"But what he says is unpleasant!" Old Zheng said.

　　"Sometimes his attitude is not good, but it's for the sake of work."

　　"For work? I think he's doing it for money!"

　　"You can't say that. He has some economic considerations, also because of his heavy family burden. But he is active in his work and much stronger than us."

　　"I'm not strong because he's not a good leader. First, I don't like that what he says is unpleasant!"

　　"We can't just talk about others. Is what you say pleasant to hear?"

　　"I can't compare with him; he's the driver chief."

　　"That's right. You know he's the driver chief, so we should obey him! Also, the old hero is getting old, unlike us young people who can figure things out easily if there are problems. If we have opinions about him, we should offer them properly and help him. For example, if you were the driver chief and everyone contradicted you, making you lose face, would you feel good? Besides, we just established the principles of unity, friendship, and mutual assistance, and you're already arguing again, which is not good!"

　　Old Zheng had nothing to say, but he was still unconvinced in his heart. After speaking, he went to Shang Baoheng and said:

　　"It's no good! You were right! It's really troublesome when the Party members come."

　　"What's wrong? Did Guo Shude talk to you?"

　　"Yes, Guo Shude and the old hero are in cahoots, and he's good at reasoning, so it's hard to fight!"

　　"Don't panic, old brother," Old Shang said. "No problem. He's a new driver and nothing special. It's no good if he can only talk but can't do anything."

　　"That's right, we'll see!" The sage was happy. (Attached picture)

    丁克辛  轻影作
    二十四、头一条要改正过去的缺点
    郭树德就去找老英雄，谈今后的工作计划。
    老英雄着了慌！以前，工作虽然不错，但从来没有很好的计划过。半天他才说：
    “定计划，我可不会，郭大车你闹吧，怎么定怎么好。”
    郭树德说：
    “你是车上的领导人，当然由你领导大家来定。虽说我在朱德号定过计划，也知道得不多，不过我可以帮助你，知道多，贡献多，知道少，贡献少。”
    结果，迎接冬运的三个月的工作计划，经过大伙讨论同意后（不同意的也没有明白表示反对）定出来了，内容不少，有的是计划，有的像公约，共有十三条：要节约物资（包括省煤省油等在内）减低成本；要每月达成六千公里安全走行；要战胜寒冬不叫苦；绝不走私；加紧政治技术学习，养成新的劳动态度；团结友爱互相帮助等等。
    老英雄把这个向大家宣布以后，郭树德接着说：
    “依我看，头一条和最末一条最重要！”
    头一条是：要保证改正过去的缺点！
    最末一条是：要每星期开一次小组会，检讨工作进行批评。
    “只有先做到这两条，别的才能一条条都实现，才能真正争取做全段机车的榜样！”末了他问：
    “大家伙儿有信心没有？”
    青年们都回答“有！”老商老郑没有说“有”，可是也没有像以前一样反对。
    李永老英雄开始感到郭大车比他强，比他有办法，“咱可得好好的向他学习，请他多帮忙。”他想：“咱以前领导开会一次也没有今天开的好！……”
    他对工作前途似乎有了新的信心。
    可是新计划实行没有几天，郑笃恭又和老英雄顶了起来。郑笃恭的劲头是：郭树德我暂时不好意思顶他，你老英雄我还不知道你！
    老英雄再也受不住了，找到郭树德说：
    “还是不行，把人换一换吧，我领导不了老圣人！”
    郭树德说：
    “老英雄，你不用着急，咱们不是规定有小组会，后天小组会上咱们就检讨老郑的事情。”停了停，看了看李永后又说：
    “不过，你在这件事情里是不是也有点缺点，你最好也想一想，到那一天也说一说。”
    “我？……”
    “嗯，你！只要你先在会上做了检讨，我保证小组会就开得更好。”
    老英雄一时不说话了，望着郭树德。郭树德又叫他想想，就找郑笃恭去了。
    和老郑说了一阵闲话，就谈到他和老英雄顶嘴的事情。郭树德道：
    “人家是司机长，咱们应该服从他。再说，人家工作有经验，咱们更应该尊敬他，向他学习。”
    “可是他说话不好听！”老郑说。
    “有时他态度不好，但是为了工作。”
    “为工作？我看他是为钱！”
    “你不能这么说。他有些经济观点，也是家庭负担重的关系。可是人家工作积极，比咱们强的多。”
    “我不强是他领导得不好，我第一不服他说话不受听！”
    “咱不能光说人家，你说话受听吗？”
    “我不能和他比，他是司机长。”
    “那就对了，你知道他是司机长，咱就应当服从他！再加老英雄上了年纪，不像咱年青人有问题能想开，咱对他有意见，好好提，帮助他。比方你要是司机长，大伙都碰你顶你，给你脸上抹不开，你心里好受不？再说，团结友爱互相帮助刚定出来，你们又吵，多不好！”
    老郑没有话说了，可是心里还不服。说完话他就去找商宝恒，说道：
    “不行啦！你算说对了！党员来了真麻烦。
    “怎么回事？郭树德找你了？”
    “对，郭树德和老英雄一个鼻孔出气，又会讲道理，不好斗哇！”
    “不要慌，老弟，”老商说：“没问题，他是新司机，没有什么了不起，光能说不能干也不行。”
    “对，走着瞧！”圣人高兴啦。（附图片）
