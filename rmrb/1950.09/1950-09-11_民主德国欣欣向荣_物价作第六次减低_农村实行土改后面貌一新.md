Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, September 4th: According to TASS, Berlin: In contrast to the so-called "wartime inflation" created by American and British imperialism in West Germany, the German Democratic Republic, immediately following the price reduction on July 17th, has now announced the implementation of its sixth price reduction. According to an announcement by the German Democratic Republic's Information Bureau: State-owned stores have decided to further reduce prices starting September 4th. The price of bread will be reduced by 55 percent, the price of meat by 25 percent, the price of butter by 15 percent, the price of vegetable oil by 20 percent, and the prices of other food items will be reduced accordingly. The prices of industrial manufactured goods will be reduced by 10 to 40 percent. This new price reduction will further increase the real wages of the working people.

Electric News Agency, Berlin, September 7th: The village of Taubenheim in Meissen County, Saxony, in the German Democratic Republic, is a typical example illustrating how democratic land reform has changed the face of the Republic's countryside. As a result of the implementation of land reform, landless and land-poor farmers each received seven hectares of land and a calf. Twenty-three new farmers (six of whom are new immigrants) have been allocated land. The emancipated farmers moved into the spacious houses of the former landlords. Before 1945, the residents of the village lived under the thumb of a Junker landlord who owned 236 hectares of land. Now, the emancipated farmers are cultivating their own fields. Through everyone's mutual assistance and joint labor, eight new farms have been established in the village.

Today, each emancipated farmer's family has three cows, as well as horses and pigs. The harvest was completed on August 5th, and this year's harvest is much better than before the war. The "Engels" machine tractor station was established in a large manor that formerly belonged to the landlord. The station has twelve tractors and eight combine harvesters, as well as other agricultural machines, which have been of great help to the emancipated farmers in harvesting. Cooperation between farmers and cooperatives has also proven to be very good. Currently, 40 percent of farmers have joined cooperatives.

　　民主德国欣欣向荣  物价作第六次减低
    农村实行土改后面貌一新
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：与美英帝国主义在西德制造所谓“战时涨风”相反，德意志民主共和国紧接七月十七日减低物价之后，顷又宣布实行第六次减低物价。据德意志民主共和国新闻局宣布：国营商店已决定自九月四日起进一步减低物价。面包价格减低百分之五十五，肉类价格减低百分之二十五，奶油价格减低百分之十五，植物油价格减低百分之二十，其余各项食品价格亦相应减低。工业制造品价格将减低百分之十到四十。这次重新减低物价，将使劳动人民的实际工资，更进一步提高。
    【新华社九日讯】电通社柏林七日讯：德意志民主共和国萨克森州麦生县的桃本海姆村，是一个典型的范例，说明了民主的土地改革如何改变了共和国的农村面貌。由于实行了土地改革，无地少地的农民每家分得了七公顷的土地和一头牛犊，二十三个新农民（其中有六人系新移民）都分配到了土地。翻身的农民搬进了从前地主的宽敞房舍。在一九四五年以前，该村居民是在一家占有二百三十六公顷土地的容克地主的鼻息下过活的。现在，翻身的农民耕作着他们自己的田地了。经过大家的互助与联合的劳作，村里建立了八个新农场。
    今天，每家翻身农民已有三头牛，还有马和猪。八月五日，该地已经收割完毕，今年的收成远比战前还好的多。在从前地主的一座大庄园里，成立了“恩格斯”机器拖拉机站。该站有十二架拖拉机与八架捆禾机以及其他的农业机器，这些机器在收割方面对翻身农民帮助极大。至于农民与合作社间的合作也证明是很好的。现在百分之四十的农民参加了合作社。
