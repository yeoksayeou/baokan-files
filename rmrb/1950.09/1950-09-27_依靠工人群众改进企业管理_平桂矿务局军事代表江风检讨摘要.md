Relying on the Working Masses to Improve Enterprise Management
Summary of a Self-Criticism by Jiang Feng, Military Representative of Pinggui Mining Bureau

I. Bureaucratic Leadership Methods

The bureaucratic style of leadership seriously exists within myself, and I am gradually overcoming it. Where does bureaucracy come from? My personal self-criticism: 1. There is no clear division of labor, inability to promote organization, or responsibility at each level, but rather personal micromanagement; 2. Failure to timely break away from the old methods and old systems in the enterprise, especially wasting countless time on paperwork, official documents, and stamping, which could be used for more beneficial things; 3. Ideological problems, believing that there are few cadres and many things to do, making bureaucracy unavoidable; also believing that great things all start from small things. This provides a theoretical basis for bureaucracy. What adverse consequences has bureaucracy produced in my personal work? 1. Poor ideological leadership, inability to timely correct the various incorrect ideas of new and old cadres regarding enterprise management. 2. Sitting in the office for long periods, unable to go deep into factories and mines, understand the situation below, and promote work, thus making it difficult to implement work and many resolutions remaining on paper. 3. Failure to grasp the center, inability to solve the urgent and major issues of principle, and also inability to foresee the future of work.

The problem of bureaucracy is quite common among our cadres. Many old cadres have this problem to varying degrees. Military representatives and takeover cadres in various production units often run around; but they cannot distinguish responsibilities from factory and mine directors and original management personnel, managing everything but not necessarily managing it well; often leaving people idle, or only asking them for advice, not having real authority and responsibility. They do not unite, educate, and help new cadres well, nor do they give play to their enthusiasm, but only believe that they have low ability and little experience and cannot handle affairs. Another manifestation of bureaucracy is paying attention only to studying the details of the production process, relaxing the policy issues of organizing production and completing tasks.

Do new cadres have bureaucracy? Yes! Fiddling around, busy with nothing, low efficiency; unable to grasp the main problems of work. We have a factory director in one production unit who even does the mimeographing himself. Although the spirit of handling affairs is commendable, it is difficult to handle big things well by only paying attention to small things.

Can bureaucracy be overcome? Of course, it can be. According to my personal experience, as long as one recognizes its harm, is able to make a determination and find certain methods, it can be completely overcome. For example, we adjusted the organization and adopted a system of responsibility at each level, which reduced the official documents sent to us for approval by more than 90 percent. This enables us to use more thought, actively consider work, and delve into factories and mines to solve problems.

Closely related to the bureaucratic style is our lack of discipline and thoroughness in work. In our work, many things that have been discussed and decided upon often cannot be implemented. In addition, many units have not made timely reports and requests for instructions: We had to urge them to write reports on the two motor damages; there has been no report on the several power outages at the power plant to this day; and sometimes there are no reports on casualties in production accidents.

II. Inability to Rely on Workers to Manage Enterprises

Relying on workers and democratizing management are the basic principles of managing people's enterprises. In our actual work, the understanding of this principle is obviously insufficient. Often there is a general recognition of relying on workers, but in actual work, uniting and educating workers is not done enough; relying on workers still remains in words. I personally showed this shortcoming in my work. Since March, I have believed that the production tasks are heavy and my personal energy is limited, so I have given little help and support to the work of the trade union. Some administrative leaders of factories and mines also have the same performance. They may be dissatisfied with the weakness of the trade union work, but in reality, they have not given support and help to the trade union work, but only criticized it from the sidelines.

Our attitude towards workers is generally of two kinds: one is to grasp a few relatively advanced and active workers, while losing the unity and education of all workers, so that activists are often in an isolated position among the broad masses of workers. This is mainly the responsibility of our leadership. One is that they have not really realized the strength of the workers, do not pay attention to the important role of workers in production, and have not fully estimated that the level of awareness of workers has rapidly improved after education and enlightenment since liberation. This point has been demonstrated by the actions of workers in inventory, bond purchases, and relief for unemployed workers. On the contrary, we only see the backward side of the workers. Therefore, we have overestimated the role of production management personnel in organizing production. And due to historical reasons and the special circumstances of mine production, some of these management personnel, especially those who directly command workers, are even oppressing and suppressing workers; if they are not transformed, they will become an obstacle to the democratization of management.

We also have an incorrect understanding of the democratization of management: We always entangle the democratization of management with the organizational form of the factory management committee. First of all, it was me personally who believed that organizing a management committee was too early, the conditions were not mature, and it was easy to become a mere formality, thus neglecting the democratization of management. In fact, even without the organizational form of the management committee, it is entirely possible and necessary to carry out democratic reforms in production and in various tasks; our bureau's double inspection movement of checking waste and checking safety in May and June is proof of this. We have also carried out some democratic reforms in certain production departments and management departments, but in general, we have not made a good start.

The implementation of the policy of relying on workers and democratizing management is a serious issue. We should face up to the fact that we still have many weaknesses in organizing production and managing production in the first half of the year. For example, labor efficiency has generally not improved; according to the tin mine's estimate, the labor efficiency of miners is one-third lower than before liberation; the problem of organizing labor has not been seriously studied and improved; the conscious labor discipline of workers has not been established; the phenomenon of labor waste still exists; the effectiveness of machinery and other production equipment and the improvement of technology have not shown results; the change of all these situations, it is certain that only by relying on the workers' consciousness, enthusiasm, and creativity, and by widely soliciting workers' opinions, can it be done.

III. Unclear Thinking on Relying on Workers in Trade Union Work

Among our trade union cadres, the thinking on relying on workers is also not clear enough. What are some of the problems? The first is: In a production department, the issue of which department's worker work should be done well first. The coal mine once followed the path of "focusing on mechanics and ignoring underground workers"; now it has shifted to paying attention to the work of underground workers. The tin mine raised the question very early: "Should the focus of worker work be placed on mechanics and electricians, or on miners?" This question has not been resolved to this day. It should be affirmed that wherever there are the most workers, wherever the workers are the main force of production in that unit, we should first do the worker work well there, and first mobilize the workers there. The second is the question of what to rely on workers to do. There is no doubt that we must rely on workers to engage in production and participate in production management. We have done some work in this regard, such as the two staff representative meetings, which discussed many production management issues, but it is still far from enough! We have done more in mobilizing workers to engage in entertainment and study than in mobilizing workers to engage in production. There is such an example: the director of the trade union in one of our production units did not know the planned output of the main products of the unit for the current month even after thirteen days of June had passed. The third is the question of how to rely on workers. There is no doubt that we must first approach the workers, understand the workers, understand their characteristics, understand their lives, understand their emotions and demands, and then, with boundless enthusiasm, according to the possible conditions, care for and take care of their lives, and solve their reasonable demands; for things that cannot be done temporarily, or problems that they misunderstand, explain and explain to them patiently. We have obviously not done enough in this regard. The public has spent a lot of money to open supply stores to solve the needs of employees for daily necessities. This matter has not been done well to this day. For example, in a certain production unit, the public stored three radios, and the workers asked to take them out to listen because they had no other cultural and entertainment facilities; but our comrades said they were afraid of the workers breaking them, and they were never willing to move them out; the workers thought we were afraid of them listening to Taiwanese broadcasts, and they didn't dare to mention it. And our trade union cadres sometimes replaced the responsibilities of the administration to catch workers gambling. Banning gambling is right, but the trade union should stand in the position of education and run legitimate entertainment so that workers can get rid of illegitimate entertainment.

　　依靠工人群众改进企业管理
    平桂矿务局军事代表江风检讨摘要
  一、事务主义的领导方法
    事务主义的领导作风，在我本身就严重存在着，现在正逐步克服。事务主义从何而来？我个人的检讨：一、没有明确分工，不能推动组织，按级负责，而是个人一把抓；二、不能及时摆脱企业中的旧方法旧制度的束缚，特别在笔墨、公文、盖章上面浪费了无数时间，这些时间是可以做更有益的事情的；三、思想上的毛病，认为干部少，事情多，事务主义是没法避免的；又认为大事皆从小事做起。这就替事务主义找了理论根据。事务主义在我个人的工作中产生了什么不良结果呢？一、思想领导差，不能及时纠正新老干部对管理企业的各种不正确思想。二、长坐机关，无法深入厂矿、了解下情、推动工作，因此，使工作难于贯彻，许多决议停留在纸面上。三、抓不住中心，不能解决原则的迫切的重大问题，同时也就不能预见工作的将来。
    事务主义的毛病，在我们干部中相当普遍的存在着。许多老干部或多或少都有这个毛病。各生产单位中的军事代表、接管干部，常是跑来跑去；但他们跟厂矿长和原有的管理人员，分不清职责，什么都管而又不一定管得好；常把人家闲在那里，或只找人家参谋参谋，并不是有职有权。对新干部不是很好地团结、教育、帮助他们，发挥他们的积极性，而只认为他们能力低，经验差，不能办事。事务主义的另一种表现，是只注意钻研生产过程中的细节，放松了组织生产完成任务的方针政策问题。
    新干部有没有事务主义呢？有的！东摸摸，西摸摸，无事忙，效率低；抓不住工作的主要问题。我们有一个生产单位的厂长，连写复写都要自己动手，办事的精神虽然可嘉，但只注意小事，就难把大事办好。
    事务主义能不能克服呢？当然是可以的。根据我个人的经验，只要认识了他的危害性，能够下决心并找出一定办法，就完全可以克服它。例如我们调整了机构，采取按级负责制，送给我们批阅的公文，就减少了百分之九十以上。这就使我们能多用思想，主动地考虑工作，深入厂矿解决问题。
    与事务主义作风密切相连的，是我们的工作缺乏纪律性和贯彻性。我们的工作中，许多经过讨论做出决定的东西，常常不能贯彻执行。另外，很多事情，各单位都没有做到及时的报告请示：两次电机损坏，还是我们催促才写来报告；电厂几次停电事故，至今还没有片纸只字的报告；生产中伤亡事故，有时也没有报告。
  二、不会依靠工人管理企业
    依靠工人与管理民主化，这是人民企业管理的基本方针。在我们的实际工作中，对这一方针的认识显然不够。常常是一般的认识依靠工人，在实际工作中，团结教育工人却做得不够；依靠工人还停留在口头上。我个人在工作中就表现出这种缺点。从三月份以来，认为生产任务繁重，个人精力有限，因此对工会工作很少帮助和支持。部分厂矿行政领导同志也有同样表现，他们也许不满意工会工作的薄弱，但实际也未给工会工作以支持和帮助，而仅从旁批评。
    我们对工人的态度一般有两种：一种是抓住了少数比较先进和积极的工人，而丢掉了对全体工人的团结和教育，因此，积极分子在广大工人中常常处于孤立地位。这主要是要由我们领导上负责任的。一种是还没有真正认识到工人的力量，不重视工人在生产中的重要作用，没有充分估计解放后工人经过教育启发，觉悟程度已经迅速提高。这一点，在清点、购债、救济失业工人等工作中，工人们已经用行动表现出来。恰恰相反，我们却只看到工人中落后的一面。所以在组织生产中过高估计了生产管理人员的作用。而由于历史的原因和矿场生产的特殊情况，这些管理人员中特别是直接指挥工人的，有些甚至是压迫工人、压制工人的；他们如果不经过改造，就将成为管理民主化的障碍。
    我们对管理民主化，还有一种不正确的认识：总把管理民主化跟工厂管理委员会的组织形式纠缠起来。首先是我个人，认为组织管理委员会过早，条件不成熟，容易流于形式，因而忽略了管理民主化。实际上纵然没有管委会这种组织形式，在生产中，在各种工作中进行民主改革也是完全可能与必要的；我局五、六月份检查浪费检查安全的双检运动就是证明。我们在某些生产部门，管理部门也曾进行了一些民主改革，但总的说来，还未做出一个良好的开端。
    依靠工人和管理民主化，这一方针的贯彻，是一个严重的问题。应该正视上半年我们在组织生产、管理生产中还存在许多弱点。例如劳动效率一般没有提高；据锡矿估计，矿工劳动效率反而比解放以前低了三分之一；劳动力的组织问题还未着手认真研究改进；工人中自觉的劳动纪律还未建立；劳动力浪费现象还存在；机器及其他生产设备效能的发挥，技术的改进，还没有显出成绩；所有这些情况的改变，肯定的说，只有依靠工人的自觉性、积极性、创造性的发挥，依靠广泛征集工人意见，才可以办到。
  三、工会工作中依靠工人思想不明确
    在我们的工会干部中间，依靠工人思想也不够明确，有些什么问题呢？第一是：在一个生产部门中间，首先应把那一个部门的工人工作做好的问题。煤矿曾走过“抓紧机工，放松下井工人”的道路；现在才转变到注意下井工人的工作。锡矿很早便发生过疑问：“工人工作重点应放在机电工身上，还是放在矿工身上呢？”这问题至今还未解决。应该肯定下来，那里的工人群众最多，那里的工人是该单位生产的主力，我们就应该首先把那里的工人工作做好，首先把那里的工人发动起来。第二是依靠工人来做什么的问题。毫无疑问，是要依靠工人来搞生产，参加生产管理。我们在这方面做了一些工作，比如两次的职工代表会，都讨论了许多生产管理的问题，但还很不够！我们发动工人搞文娱，搞学习比发动工人搞生产做得多些。有这样一个例子，我们一个生产单位的工会主任，在六月份已经过去十三天时，还不知道本单位当月的主要产品计划产量。第三是怎样依靠工人的问题。毫无疑问，首先要接近工人，了解工人，了解他们的特点，了解他们的生活，了解他们的情绪和要求，然后，抱着无限的热诚，根据可能的条件，关心、照顾他们的生活，解决他们的合理要求；对暂时不能办到的事情，或他们有误解的问题，向他们耐心的解释和说明。这方面，我们显然做得不够，公家出了许多钱，开办供给商店，解决职工生活日用品的需要。这桩事到现在还未办好。再如，某一生产单位，公家存放三部收音机，工人因没有其他文化娱乐设备，要求拿出来收听；但我们的同志说是怕给工人搞坏，始终不肯搬出来；工人以为我们害怕他们收听台湾广播，也不敢多提了。而我们的工会干部，有时却代替了行政的职责，去抓工人的赌博。禁赌是对的，但工会更应该站在教育的地位，并兴办正当的娱乐，才能使工人丢掉不正当的娱乐。
