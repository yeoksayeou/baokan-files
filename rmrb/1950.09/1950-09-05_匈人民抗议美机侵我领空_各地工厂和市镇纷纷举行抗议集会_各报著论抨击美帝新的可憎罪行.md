Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 4th: After learning the news of the US imperialists' renewed shameful provocation in Northeast China, the working people of Hungary held protest rallies in factories and towns everywhere. In a factory named "Langer" in Budapest, worker Istvan said, "The United States wants to launch a new war. Perhaps they have forgotten the failure they suffered in China." Workers in many factories sent out protest letters. At a rally in the first district of Budapest, District Committee member Laszlo said: "To those who think the destruction is not enough, to those who want to attack China after attacking Korea, we must resolutely say: 'No!' If they attack China today, they will attack us tomorrow." The meeting sent a telegram stating: "We resolutely protest against the US imperialists' attacks on the peaceful residents and territory of China. We demand that our protest be immediately submitted to the Security Council."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Prague, September 4th: In recent days, Hungarian newspapers have angrily condemned the US imperialists' provocations against China.
　　The Hungarian Workers' Party Central Committee's organ, *Free People* newspaper, stated after pointing out that MacArthur's statement revealed the United States' shameless conspiracy of aggression against Taiwan: "The people of all countries in the world now know who is the mastermind behind the aggression against Taiwan and the provocative bombing of peaceful cities and residents of China."
　　The Hungarian Trade Union Central Organ, *People's Voice* newspaper, commented on the crime of US aircraft intruding into our airspace and strafing our people: "This new heinous crime of the imperialist warmongers makes the people of all countries see more clearly that the US imperialists are expanding their adventurous plans. The Chinese people have already given the US imperialists a good lesson in the Liberation War. Now they are unanimously and strongly protesting against this new provocation by the instigators of the new war." *People's Voice* pointed out: The shameful attack on the Chinese border is a new warning to all peace advocates, urging them to be more vigilant and strengthen their ranks.
　　Budapest's *Bright Newspaper* pointed out: "After attacking Korea, the US warmongers are now trying to extend the aggression to the territory of the People's Republic of China. This is the significance of the US Air Force fighting in Korea carrying out provocations against China."

　　匈人民抗议美机侵我领空
    各地工厂和市镇纷纷举行抗议集会
    各报著论抨击美帝新的可憎罪行
    【新华社布拉格四日电】匈牙利劳动人民在获悉美帝国主义者再度在我国东北进行可耻的挑衅的消息后，各地工厂和市镇都举行了抗议集会。在布达佩斯一家名为“朗格”的工厂里，工人伊斯特凡说：“美国要发动一次新战争。也许他们已忘记了他们在中国遭受到的失败。”许多工厂的工人发出了抗议信。在布达佩斯第一区的集会上，区委员会委员拉斯罗说：“对于那些以为破坏得还不够的人，对于那些要在进攻朝鲜之后又进攻中国的人，我们要坚决地说：‘不行！’他们今天要进攻中国，明天就要进攻我们了。”会议发出通电称：“我们断然地抗议美帝国主义者对中国和平居民和中国领土的袭击。我们要求马上把我们的抗议提交安全理事会。”
    【新华社布拉格四日电】在最近几天中，匈牙利报纸愤怒地抨击美帝国主义者对中国的挑衅。
    匈牙利工人党中央机关报《自由人民》报在指出麦克阿瑟的声明透露了美国关于台湾的侵略的无耻阴谋后宣称：“世界各国人民现在已经知道，谁是侵略台湾和挑衅地轰炸中国和平城市与居民的主谋者。”
    匈牙利工会中央机关报《人民之声》报评论美机侵入我国领空扫射我国人民的罪行称：“帝国主义战争贩子的这一新的可憎的罪行，使世界各国人民更清楚地看到美帝国主义者扩大他们的冒险计划。中国人民在解放战争中已给予美帝国主义者以良好的教训。现在他们正万众一心地强硬抗议新战争煽动者的这一新的挑衅。”《人民之声》报指出：对中国边境的可耻攻击，是对一切和平拥护者的新警告，要他们提高警惕，并加强他们的队伍。
    布达佩斯的《光明报》指出：“美国战争贩子在进攻朝鲜之后，现在又要把侵略扩展到中华人民共和国的领土上。这就是在朝鲜作战的美空军对中国进行挑衅的意义。”
