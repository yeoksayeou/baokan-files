Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. Concurrently with the United States openly demanding the establishment of a West German aggressor army at the Three Foreign Ministers Conference in New York and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council meeting, the US, Britain, and France, through their occupation authorities in West Germany and the West German puppet government, are intensifying their steps to build an army. According to a dispatch from the Electrical Communications Agency on the 15th, citing the London Times, the West German puppet Prime Minister Adenauer announced on the 13th the appointment of former Hitler Fifth Panzer Corps Commander Schwerin as a "Special Advisor on Security Issues to the Prime Minister" to assist Adenauer in commanding the so-called "Mobile Police Force" that he had submitted to the occupation authorities for approval in August. The day after Schwerin was appointed, according to Agence France-Presse, the High Commissioners of the United States, Britain, and France in Germany publicly issued a statement "approving all officers and soldiers of the former German Wehrmacht to serve in the West German police force." According to the Electrical Communications Agency, most of these former Hitler soldiers will be incorporated into the aforementioned "police force."

Establishing a "police force" under the unified command of the West German puppet government on the foundation of the former Nazi Wehrmacht is the beginning of a disguised establishment of a West German aggressor army. According to Agence France-Presse, Bonn, 9th, Schwerin and other Nazi officers had long ago established a so-called "Schwerin Bureau" in Adenauer's office, secretly planning army-building steps. The agency quoted reliable sources as saying that they had drafted a "secret plan to organize a Federal Security Force, the purpose of which is to supply the necessary officers when an army is finally organized." According to The Times, Adenauer is also preparing to establish a so-called "Federal Sports Security Branch," with Schwerin serving as the so-called "security" chief, attempting to secretly establish an illegal Ministry of Defense under a different guise.

Under the encouragement of the occupying authorities, the arrogance of former Nazi military personnel is increasing day by day. According to Agence France-Presse, Hitler's favorite general, Manteuffel, publicly demanded the establishment of an army that not only had infantry but also "possessed heavy weapons, an air force, and naval defense forces" at a demonstration held by Nazis in Dusseldorf on the 13th. Former German Wehrmacht Chief of Staff Halder shouted in Frankfurt on the 19th that the West German police force must be composed of former Nazi soldiers, because "only these people can exert their strength in a future possible war." However, while making this crazy cry, Halder could not help but lament the fact that deeply saddened the warmongers: "Most Germans, especially the younger generation, are unwilling to be soldiers again."

　　西德美英法占领当局与傀儡政府
    加紧进行建立西德侵略军
    竟起用前希特勒军人充当顾问
    【新华社二十二日讯】与美国在纽约三外长会议与北大西洋公约理事会会议上公然要求建立西德侵略军同时，美、英、法在西德占领当局与西德傀儡政府亦着着加紧其建军步骤。据电通社十五日引伦敦泰晤士报消息：西德傀儡总理阿登纳已于十三日宣布任命前希特勒第五装甲兵团司令许威林为“总理安全问题特别顾问”，以协助阿登纳指挥他在八月间呈准占领当局成立的所谓“机动警察部队”。而在许威林受任的次日，据法新社称，美、英、法三国驻德高级专员公署即公然发表声明，“批准所有前德国国防军的官兵，得在西德警察部队中服务”。据电通社指出：这些前希特勒军人，大多数将被编入上述所谓“警察部队”中。
    在前纳粹国防军基础上建立由西德傀儡政府统一指挥的“警察部队”，乃是变相建立西德侵略军的开端。据法新社波恩九日消息：早在很久以前，许威林与其他纳粹军官两人即已在阿登纳办公处内，设立一个所谓“许威林局”，秘密策划整军步骤。该社引可靠方面称，他们已拟就一项“组织联邦保安队的秘密计划，该计划的目的是在最后组织一支军队时供给所需的军官。”而据泰晤士报透露，阿登纳还准备成立所谓“联邦运动安全支部”，以许威林出任所谓“安全”首长，企图改头换面于暗中成立非法的国防部。
    在占领当局怂恿下，前纳粹军人气焰日趋嚣张，据法新社消息：希特勒的得意将领曼陀菲尔竟在杜塞尔多夫纳粹分子十三日举行的示威大会上，公然要求建立不止有步兵，而且“拥有重武器，空军与海防部队的军队”。前德国国防军参谋总长郝尔德十九日在法兰克福叫嚣西德警察部队必须由前纳粹军人来组成，因为“只有这些人才能在一个未来可能发生的战争中发挥力量”。但是郝尔德在发表这种疯狂叫嚣同时，却不能不为战争贩子们深深引为悲哀的事实而哀号：“大部分的德国人，尤其是青年的一代都不愿意再当兵了。”
