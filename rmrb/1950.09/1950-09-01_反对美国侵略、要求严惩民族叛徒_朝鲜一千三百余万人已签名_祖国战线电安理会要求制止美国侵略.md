　　Oppose American Aggression, Demand Severe Punishment for National Traitors
    Over Thirteen Million Koreans Have Signed
    Fatherland Front Cables Security Council Demanding Cessation of American Aggression
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st] The Central Standing Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland United Front, after listening to and discussing Chairman Heo Heon's summary report on the signature campaign for the "Korean People's Declaration" on the 29th, issued a statement saying: All Korean people fighting for the unification and independence of the motherland, regardless of wealth, belief, class, or political view, have unanimously and broadly launched a signature campaign against the armed intervention of American imperialism and its accomplices. From August 15th to August 27th, a total of 72,002 employee and mass meetings were held in the north and south of the Republic. At these meetings, 171,106 people from all walks of life expressed their determination to fight to the end against the American aggressors and the Syngman Rhee gang.

    The statement pointed out that a total of 13,319,102 people in all of Korea signed the "Korean People's Declaration," including 7,919,761 people over the age of sixteen in South Korea and 5,399,341 in North Korea. Therefore, 98% of the people in all of Korea over the age of sixteen have signed the declaration. Those who have not signed are people in the yet-to-be-liberated areas of South Korea and a very small number of Syngman Rhee's followers.

    The statement continued: The summary of the "Korean People's Declaration" shows the firm will of all Korean people to shed their last drop of blood to drive the American aggressors out of Korea and to publicly try the national traitors.

    The statement finally emphasized that without the armed intervention of American imperialism, Korea's own problems could be solved peacefully by itself, and Korea could have achieved a unified and independent country. The United States imperialists, who manipulated the Syngman Rhee bandits, provoked the fratricidal civil war in Korea, and then launched an armed attack, should be held fully responsible for the situation that has led to the bloody tragedy in Korea today.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 31st] The Presidium of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Fatherland United Front, on the 29th, sent a telegram to Malik, Chairman of the United Nations Security Council, and Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, accusing the American imperialists of invading Korea under the guise of the United Nations flag, indiscriminately bombing peaceful Korean people, and demanding that the United Nations immediately stop the American intervention in Korea.

    The telegram stated: The American imperialists have been using the United Nations flag as a cover to oppose the Korean people's cruel war for two months. The American interventionists are attempting to conceal their heinous and bloody actions in Korea and their unhidden imperialist goals from world public opinion with a smoke screen of false propaganda.

    The telegram pointed out: The American imperialists drop hundreds of tons of bombs and bullets on peaceful cities and villages in Korea every day, killing thousands of men, women, and children, but they shamelessly declare that this is to "safeguard" the "freedom and rights" of the Korean people. The actions of the American interventionists in Korea are a mockery of justice and a trampling on human morality and international law.

    The telegram quoted the "Korean People's Declaration," in which the Korean people demanded that the United Nations stop American armed aggression and hand over the Korean national traitors to the people for public trial. It emphasized that 13,319,102 Koreans over the age of sixteen have signed this declaration. This is the irrefutable voice of the Korean people that cannot be erased by American false propaganda.

    The telegram finally, based on the will of the Korean people, demanded that the United Nations, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, immediately stop the American intervention in Korea and immediately take measures to withdraw foreign troops from Korea.

　　反对美国侵略、要求严惩民族叛徒
    朝鲜一千三百余万人已签名
    祖国战线电安理会要求制止美国侵略
    【新华社三十一日讯】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央常务委员会，于二十九日听取并讨论了许宪议长关于在“朝鲜人民声明书”上签名运动的总结报告后，发表声明称：为祖国的统一、独立而斗争的全体朝鲜人民，不分穷富、信仰、阶层、政见，一致广泛地展开了反对美帝的武装干涉及其帮凶的签名运动。从八月十五日至八月二十七日为止，在共和国南北各地共举行了七万二千零二次职工大会和群众大会。在这些会议中，各阶层的十七万一千一百零六名人士，表明了全民愿为反对美国侵略者，和李承晚匪帮而斗争到最后的决心。
    声明指出：全朝鲜人民有一千三百三十一万九千一百零二人在“朝鲜人民声明书”上签了名，其中南朝鲜人民在十六岁以上的签名人数达七百九十一万九千七百六十一名；北朝鲜达五百三十九万九千三百四十一名。因此，全朝鲜十六岁以上的百分之九十八的人民，都已在声明书上签了名。没有签名的是南朝鲜尚未解放地区的人民，和为数极少的李承晚的党徒。
    声明继续指出：《朝鲜人民声明书》的总结，表明了全朝鲜人民要流尽最后一滴血，把美国侵略者赶出朝鲜并公审民族叛逆的坚决意志。
    声明最后强调指出：如果没有美帝的武装干涉，朝鲜自己的问题可以用和平的方法自己去解决，朝鲜已经可以达成统一、独立的国家。而造成今天朝鲜的流血惨祸的情势，应由操纵李承晚匪徒、挑起朝鲜同族相争的内战、并继以武装进攻的美帝国主义者负完全责任。
    【新华社三十一日讯】朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会议长团，于二十九日致电联合国安理会主席马立克及联合国秘书长赖伊，控诉美帝国主义者在联合国旗帜的掩护下侵略朝鲜、滥肆轰炸朝鲜和平人民，并要求联合国立即制止美国对朝鲜的干涉。
    电文称：美帝国主义者以联合国旗帜作为掩护，反对朝鲜人民进行残酷战争已有两个月。美国干涉者以虚伪宣传之烟幕企图在全世界社会舆论面前隐蔽他们在朝鲜进行的凶恶流血行动，和他们不能隐藏的帝国主义目的。
    电文指出：美帝国主义者每天向朝鲜的和平城市和农村投掷数百吨炸弹和子弹，杀戮数千男女老幼，他们反而无耻地声明：这是为了“维护”朝鲜人民的“自由和权利”。美国干涉者在朝鲜的行为，是对正义的愚弄，对人类道德和国际法规的蹂躏。
    电文引录了朝鲜人民要求联合国制止美国武装侵略、将朝鲜民族叛徒交由人民公审的《朝鲜人民声明书》。并着重指出：十六岁以上的朝鲜人民，已有一千三百三十一万九千一百零二人在这一声明书上签名。这对美国的虚伪宣传，是不能抹煞的朝鲜人民的呼声。
    电文最后依据朝鲜人民的意志，向联合国要求依据联合国宪章，立即制止美国对朝鲜的干涉，立即采取措施使外国军队撤出朝鲜。
