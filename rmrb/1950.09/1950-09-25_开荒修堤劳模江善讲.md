　　Model Worker Jiang Shanjiang, Who Reclaimed Land and Built Dikes
    He took the lead in reclaiming wasteland, dispelling the masses' concerns about production; he showed good mutual aid spirit in dike construction, was good at uniting the masses, and himself carried an average of eight cubic meters of earth per day.
    Jiang Shanjiang, a famous labor model in Jiangxi, is twenty-nine years old this year and lives in Lianzi Township, Second District, Pengze County. Before he was six years old, he herded cattle for others, and at the age of sixteen, he carried heavy loads for landlords. In these twenty-odd years, he worked himself to the bone, but what he got in return was not enough to eat or wear, but hunger and cold.
    But the day of liberation finally arrived. In May of last year, his hometown was liberated, and the people's government was established, leading the peasants to turn over a new leaf. This spring, the people's government called for expanding the cultivated area and launching a large-scale production movement. He was the first to respond, taking the lead in reclaiming nine mu of virgin land. Under his influence, Lianzi Township reclaimed more than two hundred mu of wasteland. He is not only active in production but also good at leading the masses and helping them dispel production concerns. This year, including land reclamation, he cultivated a total of sixty-three mu, and all nineteen members of his family were involved in the production upsurge. He said proudly, "This year is great! We won't go hungry anymore. If it weren't for Chairman Mao leading us to turn over, how could we have this good fortune!"
    Before the spring flood season, the people's government called for the construction of the Lianzi Dike in the district, and he once again took the lead. Before construction started, it was estimated that the dike would require the mobilization of one thousand workers for one month to complete. In order to complete this arduous and urgent task, he first mobilized his entire family to participate in the dike construction, and then he mobilized the masses in the township (including women) to participate, with a total mobilization of more than one thousand seven hundred people.
    In the construction of the dike, he not only played a role in mobilizing and organizing leadership, but more prominent was his active leadership and persistent spirit of hard work. He often said to everyone, "As long as we all work together with one heart, the task will definitely be completed!" During the dozens of days of dike construction, regardless of wind or rain, he always went out under the stars and returned under the stars. Therefore, he carried more earth than anyone else. In the twenty-odd days, he averaged eight cubic meters of earth per day, two or three cubic meters more than others. In total, he carried nearly one hundred and seventy cubic meters of earth himself. Every day at the end of work, he always stayed behind, laying turf and carrying spare earth on the dike before going home. During the most intense period of dike construction, he led five or six rows of people (about twenty people per row) to rush the repair. Every moonlit night, he had to carry one hundred and fifty cubic meters of earth before going back. Under his leading influence, no one was willing to slack off, so the Lianzi Dike completed its task ten days ahead of schedule. The dikes in his township were not only built faster than those in other villages but also were strong and durable: attention was paid to reinforcing the places where the dikes intersect to prevent leaks. At the same time, they also helped neighboring villages build dikes, demonstrating a spirit of mutual aid. If you ask him why he worked so hard, he will tell you bluntly, "The Communist Party has come, and the people's government is leading us to build dikes to protect everyone's lives and property, and they will also give us grain. In the past, the Kuomintang bandits not only did not build dikes but also released water to flood the fields, causing two years of no harvest, and then used the excuse of building dikes to extort grain from the people. Now the people's government is so good to us, who wouldn't want to work hard!"

　　开荒修堤劳模江善讲
    他带头开荒，打消群众生产顾虑；修堤互助精神好，善于团结群众，自己每天平均挑土八公方。
    江西著名劳动模范江善讲，今年二十九岁，家住在彭泽县二区的连子乡。不到六岁他就给人家放牛，十六岁上就给地主扛大活，曾为逃避国民党抓丁，作过两年船夫。在这二十几年中，累死累活，可是所换来的不是温饱，而是饥寒交迫。
    但出头的日子终于到来了。去年五月他的家乡获得解放，建立了人民政府，领导农民翻身。今年春季，人民政府号召扩大耕地面积，开展大生产运动，他第一个响应，带头开出了九亩生荒。在他的影响下，连子乡共开荒二百多亩。他不但生产积极，而且善于领导群众，帮助群众打消生产顾虑。他今年连开荒共种地六十三亩，全家十九口都卷入了生产热潮。他得意的说：“今年可好啦！不会再挨饿了，要不是毛主席领导咱们翻身，那有这个洪福呵！”
    春汛前，人民政府号召修筑该区的连子堤，他又是一马当先。在未动工前，估计该堤需动员一千个民工，作工一个月，才能竣工。他为了完成这个艰巨而又紧急的任务，首先动员了自己全家人参加修堤，接着又动员了乡里群众（包括妇女）参加，前后动员共达一千七百余人。
    在修堤中，他不但起了发动与组织领导的作用，更突出的是他积极带头，坚持到底的吃苦精神。他经常给大家说：“咱们大家只要同心合力，任务一定能完成！”他在修堤的几十天中，无论刮风下雨，每天都是顶着星星去，顶着星星回，因此他挑的土方比谁都多，二十几天中他平均每天挑了八方土，比别人多挑两三方，总计他自己共挑了将近一百七十公方土。每天收工的时候，他总是留在后面，一个人在堤上铺草皮，挑预备土，然后才回家。在修堤最紧张的时候，他带领着五、六排人（每排约二十人）抢修，每到出月亮的晚上，一定要挑到一百五十方土才回去。在他的带头影响下，谁也不肯偷闲，因此连子堤在预定时间前十天即完成任务。他乡圩堤不但比别村修的快，而且坚固耐久：在圩堤交错的地方都注意了加修，不使漏缝，同时他们还帮助了邻村修堤，发挥了互助精神。假如你问他为什么要这样拚命干？他会直截了当的告诉你：“共产党来了，人民政府领导我们修堤，保护咱大家的生命财产，还要发给粮食。过去国民党匪帮，不但不修，还要放水淹田，害得两年颗粒未收，反借口修堤来刮老百姓的粮。现在人民政府对咱这样好，谁还不愿卖力气呢！”
