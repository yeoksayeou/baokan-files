Militia Hero Yang Mingkun
    Strenuous Struggle, Persevered in the Suiqitai Base Area

    During the Anti-Japanese War, when our struggle behind enemy lines was at its most intense, heroic deeds and countless people's heroes emerged in various places. Comrade Yang Mingkun, a people's hero from Suixian County, Henan Province, was one of the heroes who led the people in resisting grain requisitioning and defending their homes, and organized the militia to cooperate with the main forces in combat.

    As early as 1940, when our New Fourth Army was active in the Suixian area, Yang Mingkun, inspired by the revolution, actively participated in various revolutionary tasks, and his home became a hiding place for anti-Japanese revolutionary cadres. In order to resist the Japanese invaders' burning and killing in Chenglou and Dengzhuang, he first collaborated with our anti-Japanese guerrilla forces to eliminate the Japanese invaders' close accomplices, the most brutal puppet military bandit leader, Li Yufang, and eight others who murdered revolutionary soldiers and cadres' families; then, upon his report, he captured the bully Yin Guangli alive, who had been appointed as a deputy regiment commander by the Japanese invaders, uprooting the source of disaster for the people in this area and severing the claws of the enemy's rule.

    In 1943, after more than two years of training, Comrade Yang Mingkun had become a leader in leading the local people in the anti-Japanese struggle, leading the masses in resisting the enemy's grain requisitioning and demands for money. Several times the enemy sent troops to "encircle and suppress" Dengzhuang in an attempt to seize grain, he organized the militia to deal with the enemy while mobilizing the masses to resolutely resist the requisition, and actively publicized the strength of our army, pointed out the future and hope of the struggle, and strengthened the masses' confidence in the struggle. At the most critical moment, he would say to the masses: "If the enemy pursues the responsibility for resisting grain, you should all put the blame on me and let the enemy burn my house." Under his call, no one surrendered a single grain to the enemy. Influenced by their victorious struggle, the surrounding villages also established militia organizations one after another to fight against the enemy for resisting grain requisition and defending their homes.

    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, with 130,000 "large troops", launched a large-scale attack on the Shuidong Liberated Area. At that time, the environment was extremely harsh, and local organizations turned to underground activities, and the militia led by Yang Mingkun also hid and lurked.

    The situation became more and more tense. When the enemy occupied Longqu, only eight miles away from Dengzhuang, the 250,000 jin of public grain stored in Dengzhuang was about to be seized by the enemy. Everyone felt helpless, but Yang Mingkun remained calm and, according to the instructions of the superiors, mobilized the masses to bury 160 large carts of wheat in underground pits overnight. At the same time, he mobilized all the car owners in the village to dismantle the large carts and bury the shovels and grappling hooks, making it impossible for the enemy to dig and transport the grain, and protecting the public grain from any loss.

    After September 1945, the enemy set up strongholds in the Shuidong Liberated Area, and for a time, robbery and killing occurred, and bandits rose up, and the people were in turmoil. Some of the public grain preserved in the villages was forced to be handed over, and some was robbed, but only Dengzhuang, under the leadership of Yang Mingkun, stubbornly resisted the enemy. The bandit leader Wang Zisan sent a letter to Yang Junshi, the secretary of the CCP branch in the village, threatening him to hand over the militia's guns and offer the public grain to him to become an official. That night, eight Communist Party members in Dengzhuang held a branch meeting in the cemetery in the southeast of the village. After Yang Junshi told everyone about this, he said: "Don't think that I am a relative of the bandit Wang, if I catch him, I will kill him first." Yang Mingkun also said angrily: "If you want us to hand over our guns, first hand over the bullet heads to him." His steel-like confidence in victory strengthened the fighting spirit of other party members and strengthened the unity and leadership of the branch. The meeting also discussed ways to fight the enemy.

    On the third day after the branch meeting, bad elements from other villages led bandits to Dengzhuang and robbed 2,000 jin of wheat. At this time, people were panicked again. Yang Mingkun calmly sent a letter to warn the bandits on the one hand, and deployed troops on the other. On the sixth night, he led 19 militiamen to Huayuan Village and recovered five carts of wheat and three carts of cotton robbed by the bandits. In this way, because he led the masses to adhere to the policy of emptying the houses and resisting grain to protect their homes, the people's property was intact. In the most tense situation, he also preserved six 60mm mortars, four light machine guns, seventeen pistols, two carts of white cloth, and sixty boxes of silver dollars, all of which were not lost.

    In January 1946, an enemy company attacked our Shuiliuhe Village repair shop. After hearing the news, he led five militiamen to quickly aid and bravely attacked the enemy, so that the repair shop was spared destruction. In May of the same year, he led the militia to camp in the east of the village and was surrounded by the enemy. He calmly and bravely fought the enemy. In the melee, the enemy's bayonet stabbed at him. After he dodged, he grabbed the bayonet and pushed the enemy down, leading seven comrades to break through the siege. In the Xuzhuang battle, the militia squad he led covered and rescued Zheng Jie, the injured Secretary of the Suixian County Party Committee. Because they often cooperated in blockading and attacking the enemies of Changtai, Hougang, and Yanzhuang, the enemies dared not disperse during the day and dared not come out at night, and finally they were forced to withdraw. During the second liberation of Suixian County, on the first day, he went to Caozhuang to reconnoiter alone and encountered more than a hundred enemies in the village. He attacked them with a single gun, and the enemies fled in panic. Later, he cooperated with 96 militiamen in the entire district to ambush the enemy's 46th Brigade, which was out to aid Suixian County, at Hugang. The fierce battle lasted from morning to 1 p.m., allowing our main force to successfully liberate Suixian County. In 1948, he protected the land reform in Heyang, and his squad repelled the attack of three enemy companies. Last year, he actively participated in bandit suppression, despite his eye disease, and captured fourteen bandits and seized twenty-eight guns of various types.

    Yang Mingkun's leadership in Dengzhuang's long-term struggle played an important role in the persistence of the Sui (County) Qi (County) Tai (Kang) base area. He demonstrated the spirit of a Communist Party member striving for revolutionary victory through arduous struggle. (Attached picture)

　　民兵英雄杨明昆
    艰苦斗争，坚持了睢杞太根据地。
    抗日战争期间，当我敌后斗争进行得最激烈的时候，各地曾涌现了不少可歌哥泣的英雄事迹和无数的人民英雄。河南睢县的人民英雄杨明昆同志就是当时领导人民抗粮保家，组织民兵配合主力作战的英雄之一。
    远在一九四○年，我新四军活动在睢县一带，杨明昆因为受了革命的薰陶，就积极参加了各项革命工作，他的家成了抗日革命干部的隐蔽所。为了抗拒日寇对程楼、邓庄的烧杀，他首先协同我抗日游击部队，消灭了日寇贴身走狗，杀害革命军人和干部家属最凶残的伪军匪首李玉芳等九人；随即又经他的报告，活捉了被日寇封为副团长的恶霸尹广理，拔掉了这一带群众的祸根，斩断了敌人统治的爪牙。
    一九四三年，杨明昆同志经过两年多的锻炼已成为领导当地群众进行抗日斗争的领袖，领导群众抗拒敌人的征粮要款。几次敌人派兵“围剿”邓庄，企图抢粮，他一面组织民兵与敌周旋，一面动员群众坚决抗缴，并积极宣传我军力量，指出斗争的前途和希望，加强群众的斗争信心。在最紧要的关头，他就对群众说：“要是敌人追究抗粮责任，你们统统推在我身上，让敌人烧我家的房子好了。”群众在他的号召下，没有一个人向敌人缴一颗粮。附近各村在他们斗争胜利的影响下，也纷纷成立民兵组织，同敌人进行抗粮保家斗争。
    抗日战争胜利后，蒋匪以十三万“大军”，大举进攻水东解放区。当时环境万分恶劣，地方组织转入地下活动，杨明昆所领导的民兵，也隐蔽潜伏起来。
    情况一天紧似一天。当敌人攻占龙曲，离邓庄仅八里地的时候，存在邓庄的二十五万斤公粮，眼看着将被敌人抢去。大家都感到束手无策，而杨明昆却不慌不忙，按照上级的指示，动员群众在一夜的时间便把一百六十大车的麦子埋藏在地坑里，同时，动员本村所有车户将大车卸掉，把铁锹、抓钩也埋藏起来，使敌人无法挖掘和搬运粮食，保护了公粮未受到丝毫损失。
    一九四五年九月以后，敌人在水东解放区按下了据点，一时劫杀抢夺，土匪四起，群情动荡。各村所保存的公粮有的被迫缴出，有的被抢走，唯有邓庄在杨明昆的领导下始终顽抗着敌人。匪军头子王子三捎信给该庄中共支部书记杨俊士，威迫他缴出民兵枪枝，献出公粮给他当官。当晚邓庄八个共产党员就在庄东南坟场召开支部大会。杨俊士把这件事告诉大家后说：“别看俺与王匪是亲戚，捉住了，我先杀了他。”杨明昆亦气愤的说：“要咱缴枪，先缴给他子弹头。”他的钢铁一般的胜利信心，更加坚定了其他党员的斗志，加强了支部的团结和领导。在会上还讨论了对敌斗争的办法。
    支部会后的第三天，外村的坏分子领着土匪在邓庄抢走了两千斤麦子，这时，人心又慌乱起来。杨明昆却很镇定的一面捎信警告土匪，一面布置兵力。在第六天晚上，他带上十九个民兵在花园村夺回土匪抢去的麦子五车，棉花三车。就这样，由于他领导群众坚持空室清野，抗粮保家，使人民的财产完好无损。在情况最紧张的时候，他还曾保存过六○炮六门，轻机枪四挺，手枪十七支，白布两车，现洋六十箱，都没有丢失。
    一九四六年元月，敌一个连袭击我水河流村修械所，他闻讯后率领五个民兵神速往援，英勇冲击敌人，使修械所免遭破坏。同年五月，他带领民兵在村东露营，遭敌包围。他沉着勇敢与敌搏斗，混战中敌人刺刀向他扎来，他闪过后顺手抓住刺刀将敌推倒，带七个同志杀出重围。徐庄战斗中，他率领的民兵班，掩护救出了负伤的睢县县委书记郑杰。由于他们经常配合着封锁和袭击长台、后岗、阎庄的敌人，打得敌人白天不敢分散，晚上不敢出来，最后终于被迫撤走。二次解放睢县时，第一天他单身匹马到曹庄侦察，遇敌百余在寨内，被他单枪袭击，敌人狼狈逃窜。后来他又配合全区民兵九十六人在胡岗狙击出援睢县的敌四十六旅，激烈的战斗由早晨打到下午一点，使我主力胜利解放了睢县。一九四八年在河阳保护土改，他的一个班击退了敌三个连的进攻。去年剿匪他不顾眼病领着一个班积极参加，先后伤俘匪十四名，缴获各种枪二十八支。
    杨明昆领导邓庄长期坚持斗争，对睢（县）杞（县）太（康）根据地的坚持，始终起着重要的作用。他发挥了一个共产党员艰苦奋斗争取革命胜利的精神。（附图片）
