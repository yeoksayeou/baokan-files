　　After Adjusting Public-Private Relations
　 Qian Jiaju
　 Since the government convened the meeting of the heads of industry and commerce bureaus of seven major cities in May, various measures have been vigorously implemented by local people's governments to adjust industry and commerce and public-private relations, such as processing, ordering, loans, procurement, tax adjustments, and relief for unemployed workers. These measures have greatly stabilized the business sentiment of industrialists and businessmen and increased their confidence in the future of their businesses. Furthermore, with the good wheat harvest, the promising autumn harvest, and the stabilization of prices, the Renminbi began to circulate in the countryside, gradually expanding the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and appropriately increasing the purchasing power of farmers and the general public. The situation of industry and commerce in various regions has begun to improve. In what aspects is this reflected?
　 First, looking at the situation of business openings and closures, the number of openings has gradually increased since June, while closures have been decreasing. Some businesses that had already reported closures have even applied to resume operations. For example, according to Beijing statistics, in the commercial sector, 236 businesses opened in April and 738 closed. In June, 329 opened and 210 closed. In July, 325 opened (288 approved) and 121 closed (147 approved, including those who applied in June). In Tianjin, in July, 77 industrial businesses opened and 64 closed, resulting in a net increase of 15. In the commercial sector, 329 opened and 278 closed, resulting in a net increase of 51. In Shanghai's industrial sector, such as textiles, knitting, machinery, and cigarettes, some businesses that had been approved to close down previously began to request resumption of operations in June. In June, a total of 232 new manufacturers applied for registration and opening, including 37 factories and 195 stores. As many as 32 businesses that had previously ceased operations applied to resume operations. The situation of more openings than closures has become a widespread phenomenon since July.
　 Second, market transaction volume has increased. The recovery figures for various specialized companies in Beijing were 54 billion in May, 60 billion in June, and 66 billion in July. The average daily transaction amount in the food market was 1.47 billion, an increase of 9% compared to June, and the coal transaction volume actually increased by 20%. The same is true for private merchants. The sales of a private department store in June were 170 million yuan, and in July they were 260 million yuan. The simple geometric average of the transaction volume of yarn, rice, flour, oil, sugar, coal, and salt in Shanghai in June reached 72.51% of that in January, an increase of 25.38% compared to May, and even more in July. Recently, the transaction volume of cotton yarn has reached more than 1,000 pieces per day, a world of difference compared to the dozens of pieces per day in April.
　 Third, the profits of industry and commerce have generally increased. According to statistics from the Beijing Commercial Bureau on 18 major industries in June, 15 industries had net profits and improved. The silk, paint, electrical materials, and dried and fresh fruits that lost money in May also had net profits from July. The prices of many commodities in the market have been brought into line with or even slightly exceeded the prices of trading companies. According to a survey, the profits of general industry and commerce in Beijing were mostly around 10% in July. It was considered good if one didn't lose money in April and May.
　 Fourth, the changes in bank deposits and loans also reflect the improvement of industry and commerce. As of July 28, the total deposit balance of private banks in Beijing was 52.3 billion, an increase of 23% compared to June. In particular, the business of money shops changed from stagnation to activity, increasing by 36% compared to June. The total loan balance was 22.8 billion, an increase of 36% compared to the end of June, of which money shops increased by 37%.
　 From the above piecemeal and extremely incomplete statistics, it can be proved that the situation of private industry and commerce has significantly improved since June. This improvement is uneven across regions and industries. Some industries are improving faster, some are improving slower, some regions are showing it significantly, while others are not as sensitive. However, generally speaking, the trend of improvement in industry and commerce is consistent across the country and is steadily progressing.
　 It should be pointed out that although industry and commerce have turned the corner today, it is not a fundamental improvement. Therefore, we should not have a blind sense of optimism. Chairman Mao said: "To achieve a fundamental improvement in the financial and economic situation, three conditions are needed: (1) the completion of land reform; (2) the rational adjustment of existing industry and commerce; and (3) a substantial reduction in the expenses required by state organs. It will take a considerable amount of time to achieve these three conditions, approximately three years, or even a little more." This year's autumn harvest may increase rural purchasing power somewhat, but it would be incorrect to place too much hope on it. To truly increase rural purchasing power, we must wait until the completion of land reform throughout the country, coupled with a bumper harvest. The complete land reform will take more than two years. As for the rational adjustment of existing industry and commerce, this cannot be completed in a year and a half. It involves many complex and arduous issues, such as the adjustment of the relationship between existing enterprises or industries, the adjustment between large and small industries, the adjustment between advanced and backward industries, the adjustment between raw materials and productive forces, the adjustment between production and sales, the adjustment between regions, and the adjustment between profits, prices, and wages... The government's vigorous adjustment of public-private relations is only one item in the adjustment of existing industry and commerce. In addition to public-private relations, there are also the relations between state-owned enterprises, the relations between private enterprises, the relations between industry and commerce, and the relations between finance and industry and commerce, all of which need to be adjusted. This adjustment will take at least two or three years. As for the third item mentioned by Chairman Mao, namely, the substantial reduction of expenses required by state organs, since Taiwan and Tibet have not yet been liberated and US imperialism has openly revealed its hideous face of aggression, we still need to continue to spend money on national defense construction. Therefore, there cannot be a substantial reduction in state expenditures in two or three years. Therefore, we say that the turnaround in industry and commerce after the adjustment of public-private relations is only the beginning of improvement, but it is not a fundamental improvement.
　 However, after the situation in industry and commerce began to improve, speculative activities did not fundamentally stop. On the contrary, some speculative merchants still want to seize the opportunity and relive their old dreams of muddling through in the Kuomintang era. This is mainly manifested in prices. For example, after Truman issued his statement on June 27 regarding the invasion of Korea and Taiwan, some merchants were oversensitive. They believed that World War III was about to break out, so they took the opportunity to manipulate and drive up prices, causing the prices of imported goods and some materials to fluctuate. The black market for gold and banknotes also suddenly rose. In Shanghai, even real estate, which had been stagnant for a long time, became active. Fortunately, our government was fully prepared and knocked it down within three or two days. Recently, US imperialist planes invaded our northeast airspace, and market sentiment showed fluctuations again, but now it is tending to calm down! In fact, we can tell speculative merchants frankly that today the government can fully control the prices of daily necessities for the people's livelihood. We have the power to crack down on any speculative merchant's activities to fish in troubled waters in daily necessities. We can prove this from the price index in recent months: if we take the end of June as 100 for our total price index, then it was 106.1 on July 29. If we take the end of July as 100, then it was 100.9 on August 29. This shows that our prices are stable. If speculative merchants want to take advantage of the fire, they will surely suffer the consequences.
　 Another bias after the adjustment of public-private relations is the speculative and opportunistic style and the mentality of relying on the government among private industrialists and businessmen. Such examples have repeatedly occurred in Shanghai and other places. For example, after the announcement of the national machinery industry processing plan, the price of hardware and materials in Shanghai soared. On June 30, the East China Industrial Department held a joint meeting to prepare to establish a standard labor cost assessment team, but the trade association took the lead and first set higher prices, so that all factories united to fight for high prices. For example, some factories do not want to work hard to improve their management methods and reduce costs, but only hope that the government will increase the processing fees for commissioned processing or the prices of ordered purchases, and there are constant occurrences of shoddy workmanship and deception of the government. Some believe that since the government wants to adjust public-private relations today and has decided not to let private industry and commerce collapse, they simply rely on government loans and support and procurement, and do not want to work hard on how to be self-reliant, reduce waste, and cost accounting. Some private merchants even use this opportunity to counterattack government cadres. If the government does not take care of private merchants enough, they think that the cadres' thinking is biased and demand correction. On the one hand, private merchants in Tianjin demanded that trading companies adjust wholesale and retail prices. After the trading companies raised retail prices, some private merchants lowered the prices of the same goods below the trading companies' list prices to compete with the trading companies. For example, some factories blindly accept orders without considering their equipment and production capacity, but only know how to desperately grab business. After grabbing the business, they subcontract it to others to make profits. All of these show that some private industrialists and businessmen still retain strong old ideas and old styles. They do not put their minds on "mutual benefit for both public and private" and improving management, but only want to find loopholes and use speculative methods to obtain illegitimate gains. In the past reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, this speculative and opportunistic style of private industrialists and businessmen was excusable, because in that environment, it was difficult to survive without doing so. But today the situation is completely different. Today is the People's Government, and the People's Government is about being honest and doing things for the people. This set of styles must be completely changed.
　 The government will continue to implement the work of adjusting public-private relations in the future, and this policy is determined. However, the adjustment of public-private relations must be combined with the transformation of industry and commerce itself to achieve its due effect. The rational adjustment of industry and commerce mentioned by Chairman Mao is only one of them. Transforming the management methods of private industry and commerce is a major direction that industrialists and businessmen themselves should strive for. On the one hand, private industrialists and businessmen must completely abandon their past speculative and opportunistic styles and make self-ideological transformation. On the other hand, they must change their past management policies and methods that adapted to imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In terms of management policy, it is necessary to change the industry and commerce that served compradors, landlords, and bureaucratic capitalists in the past into industry and commerce that serve the countryside and serve the people. In terms of management methods, it is necessary to streamline and save, implement economic accounting, so as to improve production efficiency and reduce production costs. Private industry and commerce can only have a bright future if the transformation of private industry and commerce itself is combined with the adjustment of public-private relations.
　 Naturally, the transformation of private industry and commerce is an arduous and heavy task, and we cannot expect it to be completed in a very short period of time. But as long as private industrialists and businessmen resolutely implement it step by step, it is not difficult to see good results in two or three years.

　　调整公私关系以后
　 千家驹
　 自从政府于五月间召开七大都市工商局长会议以后，由于各地人民政府大力进行调整工商业及公私关系的各种措施，例如加工，订货，贷款，收购，调整税收，救济失业工人等等，大大地安定了工商业家的经营情绪，提高了他们对于事业前途的信心。再加以小麦丰收，秋收有望，物价稳定后，人民币开始下乡，使城乡物资交流逐步展开，农民及社会上一般购买力适当地提高，各地工商业情况已经开始好转，这表现在那些方面呢？
　 首先是从开歇业情况上看，六月份起开业的已逐渐增加，歇业日趋减少，甚至有些已经呈报歇业的又申请复业。例如据北京市统计，商业四月份开业二三六户，歇业七三八户，六月份开三二九户，歇二一○户，七月份开三二五户（批准二八八户），歇一二一户（批准一四七户，内有六月份已申请者）。天津七月份工业开七七户，歇六四户，开歇相抵实增十五户，商业开三二九户，歇二七八户，开歇相抵实增五一户。上海工业方面，如纺织、针织、机器、卷烟前已核准歇业的，六月起即有前来要求复业者，六月份中新设厂商申请登记开业的共二三二家，其中工厂三十七家，商店一九五家。原先停业而申请复业者即达三十二家。开多歇少的情况七月份起已变成普遍的现象。
　 第二是市场成交量增加了，北京各专业公司回笼数字五月份为五四○亿，六月份为六○○亿，七月份为六六○亿，食粮市场每日平均成交金额为一四·七亿，较六月份增百分之九，煤炭成交量实增百分之二十。私商方面也是如此，私商某百货公司六月份销货额为一亿七千万元，七月份为二亿六千万元。上海六月份的纱、米、粉、油、糖、煤及盐成交量的简单几何平均已抵一月份的七二·五一，较五月份增加百分之二五·三八，七月份更增加，到了最近，棉纱成交量每日要达一千多件，与四月份的每天只有几十件比较，真有天壤之别。
　 第三，工商业利润一般地均增加了，根据北京市商业局六月份十八个主要行业的统计，有纯益而好转的便有十五个行业，五月份赔钱的绸布，颜料，电料，干鲜果七月起也有了纯利。市场上许多商品价格已与贸易公司牌价拉平，甚或略有超过，据调查北京一般工商业利润七月份多在百分之十左右。而四、五月份间不赔钱便要算是好的。
　 第四，从银行存放款的变迁上看，也可以看出工商业的好转来，北京私营行庄七月二十八日存款总余额为五二三亿，较六月份增加百分之二十三，尤以钱庄业务由停滞而变为活动，较六月份增加了百分之三十六，放款总余额为二二八亿，较六月底增加百分之三十六，其中钱庄增加百分之三十七。
　 从以上我们所学的一些片断的极不完整的统计数字看，已经可以证明从六月份起私营工商业情况已有显著的好转，这种好转即使在各地区间，各行业间是不平衡的，有的行业好得快，有的好得慢，有些地区表现得显著，也有些地区，却不像那么敏锐，但一般的说，工商业好转的趋势却是全国一致而是稳步前进的。
　 应该指出：今天工商业虽已有了转机，然而还不是根本的好转，因此，我们不应产生一种盲目的乐观心理。毛主席说过：“要获得财政经济情况的根本好转，需要三个条件，即（一）土地改革的完成；（二）现有工商业的合理调整；（三）国家机构所需经费的大量节减。要争取这三个条件，需要相当的时间，大约需要三年时间，或者还要多一点”。今年的秋收，可能使农村购买力提高一些，但如寄以太大的希望，那也是不正确的。要使农村购买力真正提高，须待全国完成了土改，再加上丰收，而全部完成了土改，还须有二年以上的时间。至于现有工商业的合理调整，这也不是一年半载所能完成的。这里面包括着许多复杂而繁重的问题，例如现有企业或行业间相互关系的调整，大工业与小工业间，进步与落后工业间的调整，原料与生产力，生产与销场，地区与地区间，利润、价格与工资间的调整，……现在政府所大力进行的调整公私关系，仅不过是调整现有工商业中项目之一，除公私关系之外，尚有公营与公营的关系，私营与私营的关系，工业与商业的关系，金融业与工商业的关系，都是需要调整的，这种调整起码也需要有二、三年的期间。至于毛主席所说的第三项即国家机构所需经费的大量减缩，由于台湾西藏还没有解放，美帝已公开显露其狰狞的侵略面目，我们在国防建设上还需继续不断地化钱，因此在国家支出上，在二、三年内也不可能有大量的缩减。所以我们说，调整公私关系后工商业的转机，只是好转的开始，但还不是根本的好转。
　 但是，工商业情况开始好转之后，投机活动并没有根本停止，相反的，有一部分投机商人终想伺机而动，重温他们在国民党统治时代混水摸鱼的旧梦。这主要地表现在物价上，例如当六月二十七日杜鲁门发表那侵略朝鲜台湾的声明之后，一部分商人神经过敏，他们认为第三次世界大战即将爆发，于是乘机活动，哄抬物价，使进口货和一部分物资的价格一度波动，金钞黑市亦突趋上涨，在上海甚至好久不动的地产也活跃起来，幸由于我们政府有充分的准备，在三二天内便把它打击下去了。最近美帝飞机侵入我东北上空，市场人心又显波动，现在也趋平复了！事实上，我们可以正告投机商人说，今天政府对民生日用必需品的价格是完全可以掌握的，在日用品上我们已有力量打击任何投机商人混水摸鱼的活动。我们从最近几个月的物价指数中可以证明：我们的物价总指数如以六月底为一○○，则七月二十九日为一○六·一，如以七月底为一○○，则八月二十九日为一○○·九，这说明了我们的物价是稳定的，投机商如果想趁火打劫，一定会自食其果的。
　 调整公私关系后另一种偏向是私营工商业家的投机取巧的作风和倚赖政府的思想。这种例子在上海以及其他各地已经迭有发生。例如全国机器工业加工计划宣布后，上海五金器材价格暴涨，六月三十日华东工业部召开联席会议，预备成立核定标准工价小组，但同业公会却先发制人，先规定较高的价格，使各厂联合一致来争取高价。又如有的工厂不想努力去改善经营方式，减低成本，只希望政府提高委托加工的工缴费或定货收购的价格，且有偷工减料，蒙蔽政府的事情不断发生。有的认为今天政府既要调整公私关系，既然决定不让私营工商业垮台，就一味倚赖政府的贷款扶植以及收购，而不想在如何自力更生，减少浪费，以及成本核算上下工夫，甚至有些地方私商借此机会向政府的干部反攻，如果政府对私商照顾得稍为不够，便认为是干部的思想有偏差，要求纠正。天津私商一方面要求贸易公司调整批发与零售价格，待贸易公司把零售价格提高之后，某些私商却把同一物品的价格压低在贸易公司的牌价之下，以与贸易公司竞争。又如有的工厂盲目接受定货，根本不去考虑自己的设备和生产能力，而只知道拚命抢生意，生意抢到之后，又转包给别人，从中取利。诸如此类，都说明了有一部分私营工商业家依然存留着浓厚的旧思想旧作风，他们不把心思用在“公私两利”，改善经营上，而只想如何钻空子，用投机取巧的方法获取不正当的利得。在过去国民党反动统治时代，私人工商业家这种投机取巧、钻空子的作风是情有可原的，因为在那种环境之下，不这样便很难生存下去。但是今天情况已经完全不同了，今天是人民政府，人民政府是讲求老老实实，为人民办事的，这一套作风就非彻底改变不可了。
　 政府对于调整公私关系的工作，今后还要继续贯彻下去，这一方针是确定了的。但调整公私关系，必须与工商业本身的改造相结合，才能收到它应有的效果。毛主席所说的工商业的合理调整，调整公私关系仅不过为其中之一。改造私营工商业的经营方式，为工商业家自身所应该努力的一个主要方向。这一方面要私营工商业家彻底抛弃过去那种投机取巧的作风，作自我的思想改造，另方面要改变过去那种适应于帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义的经营方针与经营方法。在经营方针上要改变过去为买办地主官僚资本服务的工商业为服务农村服务人民的工商业，在经营方法上要精简节约，实行经济核算，以提高生产效率与减低生产成本。必须把私营工商业本身的改造与调整公私关系两者互相结合起来，私营工商业才有它光明的前途。
　 自然，私营工商业的改造是一件艰苦而繁重的工作，这一工作我们不可能希望它在很短时期内完成。但只要私营工商业家坚决地有步骤地去实行，那么在二、三年内是不难看出它良好的结果的。
