Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: According to people from the front lines: Whenever American invading troops and the remnant bandit troops of Syngman Rhee retreat from a place, they inevitably burn, kill, and rape, plunder the people's property, and destroy the people's houses. Their ferocity and cruelty are even worse than the Japanese fascist bandits.

　　When the U.S. military fled from Yongdong (North Chungcheong Province) and Gimcheon (North Gyeongsang Province), they used rubber hose-type aircraft to spray gasoline all over the city, and then dropped a large number of bombs and incendiary bombs from the aircraft, setting the entire city on fire. The day after the Korean People's Army entered Yongdong, the entire city was still filled with smoke.

　　On the road from Yongdong to Hwanggan, there were corpses of local farmers lying everywhere, shot dead by the U.S. and Rhee bandit troops with machine guns. A farmer who escaped from the rain of bullets guided us to inspect a mountain cave through which a railway passed. Inside were more than two hundred corpses of innocent old, weak, women and children who had been massacred. The cave was dark, stinking, and there were still half-dead people groaning. Comrades from the military medical team immediately carried the wounded who were not dead out of the cave for treatment. A surviving baby was asking for milk next to its mother's corpse. The People's Army soldiers immediately took the baby to a jeep and sent it to a village in front to be settled.

　　When we arrived at the original U.S. artillery position, we saw the naked corpses of women who had been gang-raped and then shot by the U.S. military. In the captured U.S. tanks, we also often found the corpses of Korean female students.

　　The last group of U.S. troops fleeing from Gimcheon poisoned or injected poison into the drinking water, rice, chili sauce, and even apples before leaving.

　　烧杀、奸淫、掠夺、放毒
    侵朝美军兽性暴行累累
    自永同、金泉逃窜时将两城焚毁  被屠杀的无辜老弱妇孺尸体遍野
    【新华社平壤十六日电】据前线来人谈：美国侵略军队和李承晚残余匪军，每自一地溃退，必然烧杀、奸淫，掠尽人民财物、毁尽人民房屋，其凶狠残虐比日本法西斯强盗有过之而无不及。
    当美军自永同（忠清北道）金泉（庆尚北道）逃窜时，曾用橡皮管式飞机在城内遍喷汽油，然后由飞机投下大批炸弹和燃烧弹，把整个城市付之一炬。在朝鲜人民军进入永同城内的次日，全城仍然弥漫在火烟中。
    在从永同到黄涧的路上，到处是横躺竖卧、被美李匪军用机枪扫射死的当地农民的尸体。一个从弹雨中死里逃生的农民引导我们去察看一处铁路经过的山洞，里面有二百余具被屠杀的无辜老弱妇孺的尸体。洞内漆黑腥臭，尚有半死不活的人在呻吟。军医大队的同志立即把负伤未死的抬出洞外去治疗。一个还活着的婴儿在母亲尸体旁边要奶吃，人民军的战士马上把婴儿带上吉普车，送到前面村子里去安置。
    走到原美军炮兵阵地时，我们看到被美军轮奸后枪杀的裸体女人的尸体。在缴获的美军坦克中，也时常发现朝鲜女学生的尸体。
    最后一批从金泉溃逃的美军，临行在饮水、米谷、辣酱甚至苹果中，都放进了或注射了毒药。
