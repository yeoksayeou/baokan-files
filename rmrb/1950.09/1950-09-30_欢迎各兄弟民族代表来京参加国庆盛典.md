　　To celebrate their country's birthday, representatives of all brotherly nationalities in our country have arrived in Beijing from all directions with joyful and excited hearts, crossing deserts, traversing mountains, crossing straits, and fording rivers. They represent the thirty-six minority nationalities within our country, namely: Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Uyghur, Miao, Yi, Kazakh, Uzbek, Kyrgyz, Tatar, Tajik, Xibe, Manchu, Russian, Tu, Salar, Dongxiang, Thai, Minjia, Mosuo, Axi, Sani, Ahi, Lisu, Nu, Yao, Zhuang, Dong, Li, Gaoshan, Korean, Daur, Solon, Oroqen, Tungus, and Buryat Mongolian. This enthusiastic grand reunion of all brotherly nationalities in our country is the first of its kind in history.

　　The People's Republic of China is a large family of equality, fraternity, and cooperation among all nationalities, guaranteed by the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party is the party of the Chinese working class, and the working class is the most determined and thorough revolutionary class in resisting oppression and exploitation. On the issue of nationalities, it opposes both its own nationality being oppressed by other nationalities and its own nationality oppressing other nationalities. The Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party have always struggled for the realization of the liberation of all nationalities and internationalism. From the day of its birth, the Chinese Communist Party has determined the national policy of national equality in its program, and has successfully practiced its national policy in every period of the revolution. Therefore, with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, all nationalities in China will inevitably achieve equality, fraternity, and cooperation.

　　The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates that "all nationalities within the People's Republic of China are equal, practice unity and mutual assistance, oppose imperialism and the people's enemies within all nationalities, and make the People's Republic of China a large family of friendly cooperation among all nationalities." In this big family, "national regional autonomy should be implemented in areas where minority nationalities live in concentrated communities"; "in places where various nationalities live together and in national autonomous regions, all nationalities should have a considerable number of representatives in the local organs of power," all minority nationalities "have the right to participate in the People's Liberation Army and organize local people's public security forces in accordance with the unified national military system," and "all minority nationalities have the freedom to develop their languages and scripts, maintain or reform their customs and habits, and religious beliefs. The People's Government should help the people of all minority nationalities develop their political, economic, cultural, and educational construction undertakings." The Common Program was formulated under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, through the common will of all nationalities, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, overseas Chinese, and other democratic人士. It is the action program of China's new-democratic revolution, and its national policy, like other policies, is to be implemented.

　　The People's Republic of China has been established for one year. In this year, the People's Government has done a lot of work related to national unity. The first is to mediate national disputes. For disputes among all nationalities in the country, the People's Government has always taken the most sincere concern, goodwill, and fraternity, and adopted a consultative approach to mediate for all brotherly nationalities. To this day, many barriers and contradictions between nationalities, within nationalities, and between denominations are being eliminated or have been eliminated. The unity and fraternity relations manifested after the elimination of these barriers and contradictions caused by past history have many touching and exciting facts. The second is to help minority nationalities as much as possible to restore and develop their political, economic, and cultural education. In the political aspect, in all areas where nationalities live together, all nationalities generally have representatives in the local government equivalent to their population ratio. In all areas where nationalities live in concentrated communities, preparations are generally being made to establish autonomous governments for all nationalities, and many areas have already implemented regional autonomy. With the vigorous cultivation of the People's Government, the cadres of all nationalities themselves are also growing day by day. In the economic aspect, the rural industries in some minority nationality areas have already undergone democratic reforms and embarked on the road of developing production. The economic situation in general minority nationality areas has also begun to improve. With the help of the People's Government, minority nationalities are gradually restoring their animal husbandry or agriculture. The implementation of free and fair trade has stimulated the production enthusiasm of minority nationalities. Helping minority nationalities restore and develop their cultural education is also valued by the People's Government. The People's Government has helped many minority nationalities restore, rectify, or transform their schools and develop their news and publishing undertakings under many difficult circumstances. In addition, the languages, scripts, customs, habits, and religious beliefs of all minority nationalities have received due respect.

　　The People's Republic of China is a large family of friendly cooperation among all nationalities, and its true meaning is this. The existence of this brand-new country not only means that all nationalities in China have been liberated from reactionary rule, but also means that all nationalities in China have strong weapons to defend the fruits of their revolutionary victory and strong guarantees to make themselves prosperous and affluent. Precisely because of this, the People's Republic of China is loved by the people of all nationalities in China. The arrival of the anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China has become the greatest joy for the people of all nationalities in China.

　　On the eve of National Day, representatives of all nationalities in China have come to Beijing one after another. This time, the representatives of all nationalities are wearing their own national costumes, using their own national languages and scripts, maintaining their own national customs and habits, carrying their own national culture and art, and radiating their own national glory to the capital of the people. This time, the representatives of all nationalities will meet with all brotherly nationalities with their own respectable national identities and celebrate the birth of their own country with all brotherly nationalities. Such a large-scale reunion of all nationalities in China with such a nature and such a scale has never happened in history. This is the first time.

　　This great reunion of representatives of all nationalities in China demonstrates the unprecedented great unity of the people of all nationalities in China, and this great unity breeds new patriotism. The great unity of 475 million people and the development of new patriotism are the guarantees for the victorious construction of the People's Republic of China.

　　We cheer to welcome the arrival of representatives of all brotherly nationalities. We cheer to celebrate the great unity of all nationalities in China and the growth of new patriotism.

　　欢迎各兄弟民族代表来京参加国庆盛典
    为了庆祝自己国家的生日，我国各兄弟民族的代表都怀着愉快、兴奋的心情，踏过沙漠、翻过山岭、越过海峡、渡过大河，从四面八方来到了北京。他们代表着我国境内三十六个少数民族，即：蒙族、回族、藏族、维吾尔族、苗族、彝族、哈萨克族、乌兹别克族、柯尔克斯族、塔塔尔族、塔吉克族、锡伯族、满族、俄罗斯族、土族、撒拉族、东乡族、泰族、民家、摩些、阿西、撒尼、爱黎、傈傈、怒族、徭族、僮族、侗族、黎族、高山族、朝鲜族、达呼尔族、索伦族、鄂伦春族、通古斯族、布里雅特蒙古族。我国各兄弟民族这样热烈的大团聚，是历史上空前的第一次。
    中华人民共和国是各民族平等、友爱、合作的大家庭，为中国共产党的领导所保证。中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，工人阶级是反抗压迫剥削最坚决最彻底的革命阶级。在民族问题上，它既反对自己民族被别个民族压迫，也反对自己民族压迫别个民族。中国工人阶级和中国共产党一直是为实现各民族的解放和国际主义而奋斗的。中国共产党从诞生的一天起，便在自己的纲领中确定了民族平等的民族政策，而且在革命的每一个时期都胜利地实践了自己的民族政策。所以有了中国共产党的领导，中国各民族就必然会实现平等、友爱、合作的关系。
    中国人民政协共同纲领的民族政策规定了“中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。”在这个大家庭里，“各少数民族聚居的地区，应实行民族的区域自治”；“凡各民族杂居的地方及民族自治区内，各民族在当地政权机关中均应有相当名额的代表”，各少数民族“均有按照统一的国家军事制度，参加人民解放军及组织地方人民公安部队的权利”，“各少数民族均有发展其语言文字、保持或改革其风俗习惯及宗教信仰的自由。人民政府应帮助各少数民族的人民大众发展其政治、经济、文化、教育的建设事业。”共同纲领是在中国共产党领导之下，通过国内各民族、各民主阶级、各民主党派及海外华侨和其他民主人士的共同意志而制定的。它是中国新民主主义革命的行动纲领，其中的民族政策和别的政策一样都是要付诸实行的。
    中华人民共和国成立一周年了。在这一年中，人民政府曾做了许多有关民族团结的工作。首先是调解了民族纠纷。对于国内各民族的纠纷，人民政府都是以最深切的关心，善意和友爱，采取协商方式，为各兄弟民族进行调解。到今天，许多民族间的、民族内部的、以及教派与教派之间的隔阂与矛盾都正在消除或已经消除。这些由过去历史所造成的隔阂和矛盾消除后所表现的团结友爱关系，有着许多令人感动、兴奋的事实。其次是尽可能地帮助各少数民族，恢复与发展他们的政治、经济、和文化教育。在政治方面，凡是民族杂居的地区，各民族一般地都有了相当于其人口比例的代表参加了当地政权。凡民族聚居区，大都已在准备建立各民族的自治政权，而且已有不少地区实行了区域自治。在人民政府的大力培养下，各民族自己的干部也一天天生长起来了。在经济方面，有些少数民族区域的农村业已经过民主改革，走上了发展生产的道路。一般少数民族地区的经济情况也开始好转了。在人民政府的帮助下，少数民族都在逐步恢复他们的牧畜业或农业。因为实行自由和公平的贸易，刺激了少数民族的生产情绪。帮助少数民族恢复和发展他们的文化教育，亦为人民政府所重视。人民政府曾在很多困难的情况下，帮助许多少数民族恢复、整顿或改造了他们的学校，发展了他们的新闻出版事业。此外，各少数民族的语言文字风俗习惯和宗教信仰都受到了应有的尊重。
    中华人民共和国是中国各民族友爱合作的大家庭，其真实意义便是这样。这个崭新的国家的存在，不但意味着中国各民族已经从反动统治下获得解放，而且意味着中国各民族有了保卫自己革命胜利果实的坚强武器，有了使自己走向富足繁荣的坚强保证。正因为这样，中华人民共和国便为全中国各族人民所热爱。中华人民共和国成立纪念日的到来，便成了中国各民族人民最大的喜事。
    当国庆日到来的前夕，中国各民族的代表都纷纷地来到了北京。这一次，各民族代表是穿着自己民族的服装，使用着自己民族的语言文字，保持着自己民族的风俗习惯，携带着自己民族的文化艺术，焕发着自己民族的光彩到人民的首都来的。这一次，各民族代表都以自己可尊贵的民族身份与各兄弟民族见面，与各兄弟民族一同庆祝自己国家的诞生。中国各民族像这样一种性质，像这样一种规模的大团聚，在历史上是从来没有过的，这还是第一次。
    中国各民族代表的这次大团聚，表现了中国各民族人民空前的大团结，这大团结孕育着新的爱国主义。四万七千五百万人的大团结和新爱国主义的发挥是中华人民共和国胜利建设的保证。
    我们为迎接各兄弟民族代表的到来而欢呼。我们为庆祝中国各民族的大团结和新爱国主义的滋长而欢呼。
