I Chose Peace
John Pitt

(4)

Two and a half years ago, the Anglo-American plan to militarize West Germany was still in the planning stage, but reasons were already being created to implement it. Key representatives of the British authorities held private talks with German entrepreneurs to discuss how to make the most rational use of their factories for military purposes. These representatives openly declared that it was necessary to "limit and control Germany's military potential so that Germany could not launch a war at any time," but in private conversations with reporters, they said, "This policy is wrong; the real danger comes from the East."

In February 1948, the Western powers passed a resolution to realize their intention to split Germany and include West Germany in the military system of the "Western world."

Anglo-American journalists, hoping to see their names in large print on the front pages of newspapers, began to supply "sensational" news about "tactics" that would supposedly "starve" the residents of West Berlin. But all these reporters avoided mentioning the fact that the East Berlin authorities supplied food to all Berlin residents, and that tens of thousands of West Berlin residents received East German food stamps during the so-called "blockade."

Before, during, and after the "blockade," I spoke with almost all of the major leaders of the "Western camp"—from General Clay, the American governor of Germany, to his puppet, the Social Democratic agitator and West Berlin Mayor Reuter. From those conversations, I gained a firm conviction: these people had one goal, which was to depict Berlin under the "terrible Russian threat" as a "poor, narrow, and starving Berlin" in the eyes of world public opinion.

The propaganda of war and hostility towards the Soviet Union was completely hysterical. West Berlin newspapers, led by "socialist" newspapers such as the *Telegraph* and the *Social Democrat*, generously provided journalists with material for "combative speeches." In the "correspondence" of these two newspapers (as well as other West Berlin newspapers), many news items were so absurd that even the most lying journalists did not believe them. However, they still forwarded these materials to newspapers in London, New York, Paris, and other places.

But on one occasion, even Reuters in London expressed its inability to digest the "treasures" of the *Social Democrat*. At the end of 1948, an incident occurred when a newspaper shamelessly declared in an editorial, "Berlin is heading for war." Within minutes of my sending out this news, a puzzled question came from London: "Apparently, your quote should be: 'Berlin will not be at war.'" I had to explain to my colleagues in London that there was such a newspaper in war-torn Berlin that, in its boundless hatred of the new world being built in the East, published appeals to plunge humanity into a new and more terrifying abyss of war.

The representatives of the Western powers, through their spies, seemed to know something about the German Democratic Republic, but they still believed the most bizarre fabrications in the West Berlin newspapers. For example, Remspold, the director of the political department of the British military government in Berlin, told me that new troops were being established in East Germany. When I asked him where he got this information, he replied, "The *Telegraph* published a long article about it today."

In Berlin, Western journalists seemed even more like obedient tools of the war-mongering hysterical newspapers in the hands of big capitalists than in other places.

From March 1948, when I started working in West Berlin as a Reuters reporter, until I came to the democratic zone of Berlin because I could no longer serve the warmongers, my attempts to reconcile my own personal thoughts with my job became increasingly difficult.

Most Anglo-American journalists have a completely insensitive attitude towards the "special nature" of their work, although some of them, who are honest people, often feel spiritually unhappy. They think of their high salaries and consider those barbaric laws about "free enterprise" as normal phenomena, and they continue to blindly serve the big bosses of their newspapers.

I remember several conversations I had with my colleagues when they published some particularly stupid news.

In this case, they said, "Hey, my friend, of course I know it's all bullshit, but the news is always sensational and can be on the front page."

Or they answered:

"Why do you think they give me two thousand pounds a year?"

Finally, there were also people who said, "Anyway, someone has to do it. Why not me?" – This argument was repeatedly cited by war criminals to defend themselves. (End of this section, full text to be continued)

　　我选择了和平
    约翰·皮特
　 （四）
　 两年半以前，英美的西德军国主义化计划还在拟议之中，可也已经为了实现这一计划，造出了一些理由。英国当局的主要代表与德国的企业家们进行了私人谈判，讨论如何为军事目的而最合理的使用他们的工厂。这些代表们公开地宣称：“要使德国任何时候都不能发动战争，限制和控制德国军事潜力”是必要的，可是每逢与记者们私人谈话的时候，他们却说：“这种政策是错误的，真正的危险从东方来。”
　 一九四八年二月，西方列强通过了一项决议：要使他们分裂德国并把西德包括在“西方世界”的军事体系中的意图得以实现。
　 希望看到报纸上第一版地位用大号铅字排上自己名字的英美新闻记者们，开始供给关于“战术”的“耸人听闻”的消息，这种“战术”好像是要使柏林西区的居民“饿死”。但对于东柏林当局供给柏林全体居民粮食的实情和在所谓“封锁”期间数万西区居民领到东德粮票的实情，所有这些，记者们却避而不谈。
　 在封锁前后以及“封锁”期间，我曾与“西方阵营”的主要领导人——上自美国驻德总督克莱将军，下至他的傀儡，社会民主党煽动家西柏林市长鲁特尔——几乎全体都谈过话，从那些谈话中我得到了一个坚定的信念：这些人有一个目的，就是要在世界舆论之前把“可怖的俄国人威胁”下的柏林描绘成一幅“贫困的，狭小的，饥饿的柏林”的画图。
　 战争和仇视苏联的宣传具有完全歇斯特里的性质。以“社会主义”的报纸，如《电讯报》和《社会民主党人报》为首的西柏林各报，毫不吝啬地供给记者们“战斗性演说”的材料。在这两个报纸（西柏林其他报纸也一样）的“通讯”中，许多消息如此荒诞，甚至最能说谎的记者们也不相信了。然而他们还是把这些材料转拍到伦敦、纽约、巴黎等地的报纸去。
　 但是有一次，甚至伦敦的路透社也表示过不能消化《社会民主党人报》的“珍品”。一九四八年年底发生过这样一件事，当时有一个报纸在社论中无耻地宣称：“柏林走向战争”。在我拍出这个消息的几分钟后，就从伦敦来了迷惑的质问：“显然，你的引话应该是：‘柏林不会战争’。”我不得不向伦敦同事们解释：在经历过炮火的破坏的柏林有这样一种报纸，它在对东部建设着的新世界的无限憎恨中，发表了把人类投入新的更恐怖的战争的深渊去的号召。
　 西方列强的代表们，通过了自己的间谍似乎应该了解一些德意志民主共和国的情况，但他们仍然相信西柏林报纸上最离奇的捏造的消息。例如，柏林英国军政府政治部主任雷姆斯波德告诉我说，在东德建立着新军队。当时我曾问他，从什么地方获得了这种情报呢，他回答说：“今天的《电讯报》上发表了一篇关于这件事的长篇文章。”
　 在柏林，比在其他各地的西方的记者更显得是大资本家手中那些煽动战争歇斯特里的报纸的顺从工具。
　 从一九四八年三月我以路透社记者的资格到西柏林开始工作起，直到因为再不能为战争贩子服务而来到柏林民主区为止，我想把我自己个人的思想和职务调和起来的企图，是愈来愈困难了。
　 大多数英美记者对于自己工作的“特殊性”，抱有一种完全无感觉的态度，虽然他们之中也有一些正直的人们时常感到精神不愉快。他们想到自己高额的薪金，并认为那些关于“自由企业”的蛮暴的法律是正常的现象，也就继续盲目地服务于自己报纸的大老板了。
　 我想起了我和同业们的几次交谈，那是在他们拍出了某些特别愚蠢的消息的时候。
　 在这种情况下，他们说道：“喂，我的朋友，当然我知道，这些全是吹牛，但这新闻总是耸人听闻而且能排在第一版的。”
　 或者这样回答：
　 “你想，他们为什么一年给我两千英镑呢？”
　 最后，也有这样的人，他们说：“反正要有一个人必须这样做。为什么不是我呢？”——这个论证是不止一次被战争罪犯们引用着为自己辩护的。（本节完，全文待续）
