    Welcome Representatives of Model Heroes from North China Troops
    [Our Newspaper's News] The Headquarters and Political Department of the North China Military Region held a grand gathering to welcome the troop representatives and militia representatives from North China who attended the National Conference of Combat Heroes Representatives and the National Conference of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives. The representatives arrived in Beijing on the evening of the 17th. Accompanying them were visiting members of the uprising troops from the Suiyuan Military Region. On the 18th, they visited historical sites and scenic spots in the capital. On the 19th, they were divided into six groups for discussions. Each representative briefly reported their heroic deeds. On the 20th, the Military Region Headquarters and Political Department held a welcome meeting. Political Commissar Bo Yibo, Deputy Directors of the Political Department Zhang Nansheng and Zhang Zhixiang, and 500 cadres and soldiers from units directly under the Military Region attended the welcome. At the meeting, Political Commissar Bo delivered a welcome speech. He encouraged everyone to guard against arrogance and rashness, to win again after winning, to add merit upon merit, and to always maintain the glorious title of hero and model. Subsequently, Deputy Director Zhang Zhixiang presented exquisitely crafted commemorative albums, followed by typical reports from the hero models. Among those who gave typical reports were Lü Junsheng, who had won the title of combat hero of the entire brigade eight times, and who once used a bayonet to kill twenty-seven Japanese and puppet troops; Pu Qingtang, the political instructor of the Great Merit Company in the Taiyuan Campaign; Tai Xide (Mongolian), a special-class combat hero from Inner Mongolia who charged on horseback, breaking through three lines of enemy defenses. In that battle, he single-handedly killed more than forty Chiang bandit soldiers with a saber, capturing two heavy machine guns, three light machine guns, and two 60 mortars; Huang Ruiying, a female nurse who had been awarded three major merits; Hao Qingshan, a well-known militia hero from the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, who once led seven militiamen to repel more than two thousand enemies. In ten several charges in one day, he jumped onto a moving train and captured the enemies on board alive; Jiang Weiping, a 73-year-old labor hero of the troops. The typical reports of these hero models aroused thunderous applause in the venue. All the representatives expressed their full support for the decision of the Central People's Government to convene the National Conference of Combat Heroes Representatives and the National Conference of Worker-Peasant-Soldier Labor Model Representatives, and felt infinitely honored by this. The visiting members of the uprising troops from the Suiyuan Military Region expressed at the meeting that they would learn from the hero model representatives, resolutely follow the Communist Party, and strive to become heroes and models. That afternoon, the Military Region Headquarters and Political Department held a banquet to welcome the representatives and visiting members of the Suiyuan Military Region. (Zheng)
