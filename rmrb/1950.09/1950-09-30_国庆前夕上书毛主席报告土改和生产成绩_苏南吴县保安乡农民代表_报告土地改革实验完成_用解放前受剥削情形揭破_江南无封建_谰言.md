[Report from Our Newspaper] Peasant representatives, one hundred and sixty-nine in total, from Bao'an Township, Huguan District, Wuxian County, Southern Jiangsu, sent a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting the completion of the land reform experiment in their township. They stated that the peasants were extremely happy after receiving land and houses, and used the exploitation they suffered before liberation to expose the fallacy of "no feudalism in Jiangnan." The original letter is as follows:

Chairman Mao:

We are peasant representatives from Bao'an Township, Huguan District, Wuxian County, Southern Jiangsu. Our Bao'an Township is one of the experimental townships for land reform in Southern Jiangsu. Today, the experiment is complete. We are holding a meeting to evaluate models and elect township administrative committee members. We, who used to be "the poor have short mouths, and lean horses have long hair," couldn't even get a word in edgewise. Since you ordered the People's Liberation Army to cross the river and liberate us, everything in the township, even major issues like land reform, is entirely up to us.

In our Bao'an Township, the poor and middle peasants, who account for 90 percent of the population, only own 40 percent of the land, while 50 percent of the land is in the hands of landlords. Because a small number of landlords plundered such a large amount of land, when we rented their fields, we were like oxen with rings in their noses, subject to their scolding and beating, unable to escape. The lives we lived meant that a good year was only "sixty days for the poor," and in lean years, we couldn't pay the rent, and the suffering was endless. Before the War of Resistance, landlords collected rent, and if you couldn't pay, you were dragged out for a street parade, beaten on the buttocks, and slapped in the face. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the landlords became even more vicious. They colluded with the reactionary government and set up "public warehouses" in various districts to collect rent. Collecting rent was like robbery: they surrounded villages, broke down doors, and ransacked houses. In the whole township, five children were frightened and people were arrested to face lawsuits, which led to their deaths. One of our representatives, Shi Wenxiu, had her husband and son beaten to death by the rent-collecting police in a single day. In those days, we couldn't even have one day of peace. Some landlords in Jiangnan say, "There is no feudalism in Jiangnan," which is utter nonsense. Isn't the suffering we endured feudal oppression?

Chairman Mao, since liberation, the landlords dare not be as arrogant as they used to be. Now, our Bao'an Township has completed land reform, abolishing the landlord class's feudal exploitation of land ownership. Among the 818 households in our township, 636 households have been allocated land, and 33 households have been allocated houses. "Even a withered tree that blooms after a thousand years" cannot compare to this great joyous event!

Chairman Mao, we know that all our benefits come from the leadership of the Communist Party and you. We will always be grateful to you and resolutely support you. We represent more than 3,000 peasants in Bao'an Township and guarantee to you: from now on, we will actively work, increase production, support the front lines, and liberate Taiwan and Tibet. Our township has also launched a peace signature campaign, and the vast majority of peasants have already signed. If American imperialism is ignorant and dares to undermine peace, we will resolutely unite under your leadership and dedicate our greatest strength to defeat any aggressive acts by the enemy!

Respectfully wishing you good health!

The one hundred and sixty-nine peasant representatives of Bao'an Township, together.

    国庆前夕上书毛主席报告土改和生产成绩
　　苏南吴县保安乡农民代表
    报告土地改革实验完成
    用解放前受剥削情形揭破“江南无封建”谰言
    【本报讯】苏南吴县浒关区保安乡的一百六十九个农民代表，上书毛主席，报告该乡土地改革实验完成，农民分得土地房屋后欣喜异常，并用解放前受剥削情形，揭破“江南无封建”谰言。原信如下：毛主席：
    我们是苏南吴县浒关区保安乡的农民代表。我们保安乡是苏南土改实验乡之一。今天实验完成了，我们开会评模范，选乡行政委员。我们这些人以前是“穷人嘴短，马瘦毛长”，半句话也轮不着说的。自从你命令解放军渡江解放我们之后，乡里的事，甚至像土地改革这样大的事情，也全由我们作主了。
    我们保安乡占人口百分之九十的贫雇中农，只占有百分之四十的土地；而百分之五十的土地，却操在地主手里。因为少数的地主掠夺了这样大批的土地，我们租种他们的田，就好像穿了鼻孔的牛，打骂由他们，再也脱不了身。我们所过的日子，丰年是“穷人六十日”，荒年缴不出租米，苦头就说不完。抗战以前地主收租米，交不了租捉去要游街，打屁股，打嘴巴等。抗战胜利以后，地主更狠毒了，他们和反动政府勾结，在各区设立“公栈”，包收租米。收起租米来，完全像强盗：把村子包围，破门打户，翻箱倒柜，被他们吓坏的小孩子和抓去吃官司而死的人，全乡就有五个。我们代表之中有一个施文秀，她的丈夫和儿子，在一天中被收租米的警察打死。那些日子，真是安稳一天也不能。江南有些地主说：“江南无封建”，这完全是鬼话。我们吃的这些苦，难道不是封建压迫吗？
    毛主席，自从解放以后，地主不敢像从前那样威风了。现在我们保安乡又完成了土改，废除了地主阶级封建剥削的土地所有制。我们全乡八百一十八户中有六百三十六户分到了土地；有三十三户分到了房子。“千年枯树开了花”，也比不上这个大喜事啊！
    毛主席：我们知道，我们的全部好处，都是因为有了共产党和你的领导才得来的。我们要永远感谢你，要坚决拥护你。我们代表保安乡三千多农民向你保证：今后要积极劳动，增加生产，支援前线，解放台湾和西藏。我们全乡又展开了和平签名运动，绝大部分农民都已签了名。如果美帝国主义不识相，胆敢破坏和平，我们一定坚决团结一致，在你的领导下，为打败敌人的任何侵略行为，献出我们最大的力量来！
    敬祝你健康！
