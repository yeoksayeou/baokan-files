Beijing Public Qinghe Woolen Mill
    Neglects Factory Safety Regulations
    Reader Su Ren's Letter Criticizes

To the Editorial Staff:

    The Qinghe Woolen Mill, a public enterprise in Beijing, experienced several accidents consecutively from August 1st to 16th. I hope you will publish this matter to draw the attention of the factory administration.

    Around August 4th, due to continuous heavy rain and humid air, the electrical switches frequently experienced short circuits and sparking.

    On August 4th, the No. 8 carding machine needed scraping due to uneven sliver quality. After worker Liu Quanfu finished scraping the machine, he started it and was immediately electrocuted by the switch handle. Fortunately, operator Nie Zhaoxiang noticed and immediately pulled the switch, but Liu had already fallen onto the electrified roller. He was finally carried to the front of the machine, and after artificial respiration and a cardiac injection, he regained consciousness. On the 14th, scraping worker Hou Yuliang was electrocuted when he was about to step off the electric roller after scraping the No. 7 machine. Wu Deshan urgently turned off the switch at that time, and fortunately no danger occurred.

    On August 16th, dyeing foreman Liu Shirong was strangled to death by the belt of the steaming machine.

    Comrade Liu Shirong was an old worker with more than ten years of experience. His skills and work ethic were both excellent. At 8:00 AM on August 16th, the belt of the steaming machine fell off. Stopping the machine to put the belt back on would affect the production of other machines. The production task of 100,000 yards of wool was waiting for the workers to complete. When the steaming machine belt fell off, Comrade Liu Shirong immediately climbed the ladder to hang the belt. At that time, foreman Lu Yu only said, "Stop the machine before hanging it!" and then left.

    The distance between the wind turbine and the pulley was only enough for one person. At that time, Liu Shirong used his left hand to pull the belt up and had to turn his face to hook it on. While turning his face and using his left hand to hook the belt, his sleeve was caught in the machine, and his left wrist was immediately severed. Liu Shirong was pulled up by the line shaft and rotated countless times with the shaft. His ribs were fractured due to being squeezed between the shaft and the wall. After Liu Shirong fell heavily from the line shaft, the factory immediately sent a car to take him to Peking University Hospital, but he had completely expired when he arrived at Qinghe Town.

    The factory leadership should bear the main responsibility for the occurrence of this matter. This is because the factory administration has not effectively implemented safety regulations, and the safety education for workers has been very poor. I hope the woolen mill will conduct a review of this matter.

　　京市公营清河制呢厂
    忽视工厂安全条例
    读者苏任来信批评编辑同志：
    北京市公营企业公司清河制呢厂，八月一日至十六日半个月中，连续发生数次事故。希望你把此事发表，以引起该厂行政上的注意。
    八月四日前后因连日大雨，空气潮湿，电闸经常发生跑电走火。
    八月四日，八号梳毛车因出条质量不匀，需要刮车。工人刘全福刮完车后，开始开车，即被闸把电力吸住。幸被开车工聂兆祥发现，立即拉闸，但刘已随着倒在电滚子上。最后把他抬到车前，经人工呼吸、注射强心针后，才苏醒过来。十四日，刮车工侯玉亮在七号车刮完车，正要踏着电滚子下来时，被电力吸住。当时吴德山即急关电闸，幸未发生危险。
    八月十六日，整染领工刘士荣被蒸呢机的皮带绞死。
    刘士荣同志是一个有十余年工龄的老工人，他的技术和劳动态度都很好。八月十六日上午八时，蒸呢机皮带掉了。如果停车上皮带，会影响其他机器的生产。十万码呢子的生产任务，等待着工人们去完成。当蒸呢机皮带掉下来后，刘士荣同志即上梯挂皮带，当时工长卢玉只说了一句“将车停了挂吧！”就走了。
    风轮与皮带轮的距离，仅能容一人。当时刘士荣用左手把皮带拉上去，必须转过脸来才能挂上。正在转脸用左手挂皮带时，他的袖子被机器卷着了，左腕当即被绞断。刘士荣被天轴绞上去，随着轴转了无数次。肋骨因在轴上与墙壁相挤压，折断了。待刘士荣从天轴上猛摔下来，厂内立即派汽车把他送到北大医院，但行至清河镇，他已完全气绝。
    这件事情的发生，工厂领导上应负主要责任。因为该厂行政上没有很好的贯彻安全条例，对工友的安全教育也作得很差。我希望制呢厂对此事作一检讨。 苏任
