　　"I Want to Learn from Liang Jun..."
    ——A Record of the Eighteen-Year-Old Female Tractor Driver Xu Ming
    Wang Daoyi
    Xu Ming is a female tractor driver at the Ning'an Mechanical Farm in Songjiang Province. She is only eighteen years old this year. She comes from a student background and joined the revolution at the age of fourteen. She studied at the Northeast Military and Political University and was transferred to Harbin Medical University in 1949. The revolutionary family has cultivated her into a brave, tenacious, and idealistic young woman.
    When she applied for the tractor driver training class at the Ning'an Mechanical Farm, the farm manager said to her, "We have to get up at two o'clock in the morning here, and the work is tiring. How can a little girl like you handle it?" Xu Ming replied, "If you want to do revolutionary work, you can't be afraid of hardship. If others can do it, I can do it!"
    When she first arrived at the farm, some people said, "How can she do it?" Others said, "She'll break down in less than two months." But Xu Ming used her actions to shatter everyone's underestimation of her. She listened attentively in class, studied diligently on her own time, and always ranked top in every exam. During her spare time, she was also able to endure hardship and work hard, carrying sacks and loading large oil drums with the male students. Everyone admired her. Two months after arriving at the farm, she joined the Chinese New Democratic Youth League.
    As the New Year approached, the students asked for leave to go home. She originally wanted to go home to see her mother and younger brother, but she thought, "If everyone goes home, who will take care of the farm?" So she decided not to go home. Around the New Year, she not only reviewed her lessons and helped the farm's cooperative with a lot of work, but also served as the fire prevention team leader, standing guard with other male comrades late every night. She received administrative praise and material rewards.
    The spring plowing began, and the fire plows, which had been resting all winter, began to move on the grasslands. Every day, as soon as the east began to brighten, Xu Ming would carry a large oil bucket to oil her beloved locomotive. The work was intense and strenuous. At first, Xu Ming was not used to it and was so tired that her joints ached all over. But her stubborn will supported her: "Am I really going to bow to difficulties? No, I must not give up halfway." In order not to let others see that her work was strenuous, she deliberately took large steps when walking, and still insisted on studying after finishing work. Later, she finally got used to this hard labor.
    The driver who led Xu Ming's work was a Party member. He consistently taught her patiently. At first, Xu Ming's hands were not skilled, and she drove the locomotive into the ditch several times. But she never lost heart and persisted in studying hard. Finally, her skills became more and more proficient day by day. By the time of sowing, she could use a locomotive on her own. When she drove the tractor back and forth in the fields, the neighboring women rushed to visit, all saying enviously, "Such a small girl can drive such a big fire plow, she is really a good example for our women."
    On September 5th, the first Northeast Youth League Congress opened. At the congress, Xu Ming met Liang Jun, whom she had been longing to meet. She talked intimately with Liang Jun. She said, "Comrade Liang Jun is not only a skilled tractor driver herself, but also can motivate other female comrades to learn how to drive tractors. I want to learn from Liang Jun, and in the future, I will not only do my own work better, but also help the new female comrades, so that our women can play a greater role on the front of modern agricultural production."

　　“我要向梁军学习…………”
    ——记十八岁的女拖拉机手徐明
    王道义
    徐明是松江省宁安机械农场的女拖拉机手，今年才十八岁。她是学生出身，十四岁就参加革命。她曾在东北军大学习，一九四九年调到哈尔滨医大工作，革命的大家庭把她培养成一个勇敢、顽强、有理想的女青年。
    当她投考宁安机械农场拖拉机手训练班时，场长对她说：“我们这里清早两点就要起床，干活又累，你这样的小姑娘怎么受得了呢？”徐明回答：“干革命工作就不能怕吃苦，别人干得了，我就能干！”
    她刚到农场时，有的说：“她怎么干得了呢？”有的说：“不到两个月，她就得搞垮。”但是徐明用实际行动来打破大家对她的轻视。她听课用心，课外努力自修，每次考试都列优等；课余干活时，也能吃苦耐劳，和男同学们在一起扛麻袋、装大油桶。大家都很佩服她。她在到场两个月后，就参加了中国新民主主义青年团。
    新年快到时，同学们纷纷请假回家。她原来也想回家去看看妈妈和弟弟，但是她想：“大家都回家了，农场由谁来照顾呢？”就决定不回家了。在新年前后，她不但复习了功课，帮助农场的合作社作了很多工作；还担任防火组长，每天深夜和其他男同志一起站岗放哨。她受到了行政上的表扬和物质奖励。
    春耕开始了，整整休息了一冬的火犁在草地上走动起来。每天东方刚放亮，徐明就提着一个大油桶，去给她心爱的机车上油。工作是紧张而费力的。起初，徐明还不习惯，累得满身骨节发痛。但她那倔强的意志支持着她：“难道真向困难低头？不，决不能半途而废。”她为了不让别人看出她工作吃力，走路时故意把步子跨得很大，工作完了仍是坚持学习。后来，她终于习惯了这种艰苦的劳动。
    领导徐明工作的司机，是一个党员。他一贯耐心地教她学习。开始，徐明手不熟练，好几次把机车开到沟里去了；但她始终不灰心，坚持努力学习。终于，她的技术一天比一天熟练；到播种的时候，自己就能单独使用一台机车了。当她驾驶着拖拉机在田地里跑来跑去的时候，邻近的妇女们抢着去参观，都羡慕地说：“那么小的姑娘能开动那么大的火犁，真是咱们妇女的好榜样。”
    九月五号那天，东北第一届青年团代表大会开幕了。在大会上，徐明会见了她盼望已久的梁军。她和梁军亲密地谈话。她说：“梁军同志不但自己是个熟练的拖拉机手，并且能带动别的女同志学习驾驶拖拉机。我要向梁军学习，今后不但把自己的工作干得更好，并要帮助新来的女同志，使我们妇女在近代化农业生产的战线上，发挥更大的力量。”
