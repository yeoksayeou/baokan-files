    Preliminary Experience Gained in Output Appraisal Work

    This Year's Summer Grain Collection Proves That in Areas Where Output Has Been Appraised, Field Output is Close to the Truth, and the Burden is Fair and Reasonable.

    [Our Newspaper's Report] The agricultural tax survey and appraisal work in Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces from last winter to this spring came to an end before the summer harvest. This year's summer grain collection has proven that in some areas, after land survey and output appraisal, the output per mu is close to the truth, the burden is fair and reasonable, and the masses have responded well, achieving initial results. However, there are also some areas where deviations have occurred, and the phenomenon of concealing land and output and imbalances still exists, which needs to be adjusted and corrected before the autumn collection.

    Basic Situation of Agricultural Tax Output Appraisal Work in the Three Provinces

    Due to the different work foundations in Hebei, Shanxi, and Pingyuan provinces and the inconsistent output standards in the past, there were imbalances in output appraisal. The areas can be roughly divided into three categories: (1) Old areas with a better burden foundation, accounting for about two-fifths, where the output per mu is close to the truth and the burden is generally balanced and reasonable, but there are still individual cases of being too high or too low internally that need to be adjusted. (2) Old and semi-old areas with a poor burden foundation, accounting for about one-third, where, although preliminary surveys and appraisals have been conducted, the phenomenon of imbalance still exists seriously, and more detailed land surveys and general appraisals are needed to achieve rationality. (3) New areas, accounting for about one-quarter, where many areas have not yet undergone land surveys and output appraisals and still use the unreasonable system of apportionment per mu, and the concealment of land is relatively common. According to the key survey of 68 villages in 26 counties in Jizhong and Beiyue in 1948 and the joint survey of 41 villages in 19 counties in the Jizhong, Jinnan, Taihang, and Ji Lu Yu administrative regions in March 1949, the authenticity of agricultural tax output appraisal generally showed that old areas were greater than new areas, mountainous areas were greater than plains, and dry land was greater than paddy fields. Therefore, the unreasonable phenomenon of good land benefiting and bad land suffering was manifested in the burden. This phenomenon of excessively light or heavy burdens has become a serious obstacle to the development of production. Therefore, the broad masses of farmers urgently demanded to adjust output and balance the burden.

    Different Regions Put Forward Different Requirements, Steps, and Methods

    Based on the above basic situation and the demands of the farmers, the provinces determined the requirements and steps for the land survey and output appraisal work: old areas with a better burden foundation should focus on adjusting output and strive to achieve the requirement of fixed output; semi-old areas with a poor burden foundation should combine the issuance of land certificates, clarify land, and appraise output to catch up with the old areas, so as to withstand the test of the burden in the wheat and autumn seasons this year, adjust and appraise in the winter, and fix output; new areas should focus on clarifying land area, achieve land classification according to quality, and gradually achieve fixed output through the test, adjustment, and appraisal of this winter and the wheat and autumn seasons next year; strive to achieve the truth and fixation of land output within two or three years.

    Important Preparatory Work Before Appraisal

    In accordance with the above requirements, in addition to issuing instructions one after another in December last year, Pingyuan and Hebei also held special meetings on output appraisal and output appraisal training courses; compiled pamphlets such as "Appraisal Handbook," "Brief Introduction to Agricultural Tax in North China," and "How to Conduct Output Appraisal Work in a Village (or Several Villages)" to explain policies, clear up thoughts, clarify methods, and exchange experiences. In order to combine learning with application and achieve unified standards and consistent views, Pingyuan Province concentrated more than 130 cadres from the output appraisal training class to conduct key experiments in 12 villages such as Gaopingji in Qiqu District, Hua County, to train cadres and draw experience. Baoding Prefecture in Hebei Province also trained 78 county cadres, 326 district cadres, and 990 assistants. These have created favorable conditions for this year's land survey and output appraisal work. Preparatory work before appraisal is very important and cannot be ignored.

    Implementation Status and Basic Experience

    Due to the varying degrees of understanding of the importance of the land survey and output appraisal work and the spirit of the provincial output appraisal instructions in various districts and counties, as well as the prolongation of the autumn collection time last year, the development of the land survey and output appraisal work was early or late, good or bad. According to the statistics of the existing materials so far: Shanxi Province has completed output appraisal in 27.4% of the total number of villages in the province, and completed land survey in 47% of the villages. Baoding, Cangxian, Dingxian, and Shijiazhuang Prefectures in Hebei Province have completed output appraisal in 18.14% of the villages. Pingyuan Province has completed output appraisal in 22.1% of the villages. Xinxiang and Anyang Prefectures have combined the issuance of land certificates, and the land has been generally surveyed. In some areas, due to the emphasis of the leadership, extensive publicity of policies, and mobilization of the masses, the output per mu is more truthful and balanced than before. For example, in Lingchuan County, Shanxi Province, the total land area increased by 7.4% compared with before the appraisal, and the output increased by 25.3%. In Yuanyang County, Pingyuan Province, the land area increased by 14% compared with before the land survey, in Boai County it increased by 21%, and the average output per mu in Qinyang County was 1.54 dan before the appraisal and 2.01 dan after the appraisal, which provided a more reliable basis for the distribution of burdens. More importantly, due to the in-depth implementation of the policies of diligent production and increased production and the non-increase of burdens for planting cash crops, the planting of cotton was directly stimulated, solving the masses' concerns about "unlimited burdens and paying more for more harvest," and the following important experiences were obtained: (1) The leadership attaches importance to it, takes the initiative, and responsible cadres go deep into the front line, grasp the situation in detail, discover problems, and solve them in a timely manner. (2) The masses reflected: "It is good to have truthful output, but it is not good to suffer from truthful burdens." Therefore, it is necessary to overcome the past tendency of "squeezing typical examples." (3) Different regions have different requirements. In areas with an output appraisal foundation, old materials should be fully analyzed and studied, reasonably retained, unreasonably revised, and there is no need to deny the past and start all over again. Experience has proven that it is a failure. In new areas, land area should be clarified first. If it is combined with output appraisal, it is often at the expense of the other. (4) Conduct key experiments first, and then implement them comprehensively. If the preparation is insufficient and it is implemented universally, experience has proven that it is a failure. At the same time, it must be strived to do a good job basically at one time, otherwise, if it fails once, it will be re-evaluated and revised again, which will easily make farmers tired and dissatisfied, which is not conducive to production. Farmers in old areas reflected: "Output appraisal has been evaluated ten or eight times, and we only say it is fixed, but we don't know when it will be fixed." (5) Pay attention to the cooperation of various departments and overcome the style of "fighting alone." Jiaocheng County in Hebei Province created a model of taking production as the center and driving political construction and output appraisal. Anyang and Xinxiang Prefectures in Pingyuan Province created successful experience in combining the issuance of land certificates and land survey, proving that in old areas, closely combining land distribution and output appraisal with production is in line with the requirements of farmers, so the work is easy to do; in new areas, combining with land reform and the issuance of land certificates is in line with the requirements of farmers, so the work is easy to do. (6) The policies and methods of land survey and output appraisal should be fully discussed at the county people's congress or the district and village farmer representatives' congress, made into resolutions, and elected land survey and output appraisal committees at all levels (with people's representatives participating) to implement them specifically, which is much more effective than simply holding cadre meetings. Experience has proven that land survey and output appraisal work is a major event related to the lives and production of millions of farmers, and the participation of the broad masses of farmers must be absorbed to make it their own business; only in this way can it be done well, and the use of land ranking (i.e., dividing into grades), joint village appraisal, and the organization of joint investigation and appraisal committees are the best working methods and organizational forms for combining leadership with the masses.

    Deviations Exist in Some Areas That Need to Be Corrected

    However, there are many deviations in some areas that need to be corrected: (1) Not handling affairs according to the specific situation. For example, some counties in Shijiazhuang and Hengshui Prefectures in Hebei Province allocated output requirements to villages, or mechanically divided into grades and levels by county and subjectively stipulated the output of each grade and level, which did not conform to the actual situation and was opposed by the masses. (2) Not seriously studying the authenticity and balance of the existing burden foundation, blindly starting from scratch, and taking detours. (3) Paying attention to balance and neglecting authenticity. For example, Shijiazhuang Prefecture catered to the plains with mountains, and catered to the east of the road with the west of the road, and looked to the lower level, resulting in serious theft and concealment of output. (4) Not adopting the working method of focusing on promoting the general. Some were not prepared enough and blossomed in all directions (i.e., universally promoted), forming a spontaneous flow; some were tied up and only did the key points, ignoring the promotion of the general, resulting in slowness and not keeping up with the demands of the farmers. (5) Ignoring statistical work. Some areas have completed the appraisal, but they still do not know the results of the appraisal, so they cannot understand the situation, analyze the degree of authenticity of the output appraisal, and cannot promptly check and correct deviations. (6) Localism is still quite serious in a few areas. Even in order to compare with neighboring areas, there is a deliberate phenomenon of "building high walls" (i.e., setting the output of land bordering other villages or other areas particularly high), resulting in new phenomena of excessively light or heavy burdens. These should be adjusted and corrected before the autumn collection, so as to make the public grain work more fair and reasonable in this year's autumn collection.

　　华北区河北山西平原三省
    评议产量工作获初步经验
    今年夏征证明，经过评产地区，田亩产量接近真实，负担公平合理。
    【本报讯】河北、山西、平原三省去冬今春的农业税调查评议工作，在夏收前即告一段落，经今年夏征的考验证明：部分地区经过勘地评产，地亩产量接近真实，负担达到公平合理，群众反映良好，初步收到成效。也有若干地区发生偏差，瞒地瞒产和不平衡现象仍然存在，尚待秋征前调整纠正。
    三省农业税评订产量工作的基本情况
    河北、山西、平原三省由于过去工作基础不同，订产标准不够一致，在产量评订上曾存在着不平衡现象，大体可以分为三类地区：（一）负担基础较好的老区约占五分之二，地亩产量接近真实，负担大体平衡合理，但内部仍有个别过高过低的现象须加调整。（二）负担基础较差的老区和半老区，约占三分之一，虽经初步调查评议，但不平衡现象仍严重存在，尚须较细致地进行查地普评才能达到合理。（三）新区约占四分之一，其中不少地区尚未经勘地评产，仍沿用按亩摊派的不合理制度，黑瞒地较普遍的存在。根据一九四八年冀中、北岳二十六县六十八村的重点调查和一九四九年三月冀中、冀南、太行、冀鲁豫四个行署区接合地区十九县四十一村联合勘查的材料显示，农业税订产的真实性一般的是：老区大于新区，山地大于平原，旱地大于水地，因而在负担上表现了好地沾光、坏地吃亏的不合理现象，这种负担上的畸轻畸重现象，成为发展生产的严重障碍之一。因此，广大农民迫切要求调整产量，平衡负担。
    不同地区提出不同的要求、步骤和方法
    根据上述基本情况和农民的要求，各省确定勘地评产工作的要求和步骤是：负担基础较好的老区，以调整产量为主，争取达到固定产量的要求；负担基础较差的半老区，结合颁发土地证，澄清土地，评订产量，向老区看齐，作到经过今年麦、秋两季负担的考验、调整和今冬的勘评，固定产量；在新区则以澄清地亩为主，做到土地的按质分等，经过今冬的勘评和明年麦、秋两季的考验、调整，逐步达到固定的产量；争取在二、三年内，做到土地产量的真实、固定。
    勘评前的重要准备工作
    根据上述要求，各省除先后于去年十二月份内发出指示外，平原、河北还曾召开评议产量的专门会议和评产训练班；编印“评丈手册”、“华北区农业税浅说”、“怎样进行一个村（或几个村）的评产工作”等小册子，讲解政策，打通思想，明确作法，交流经验。为了学用结合，取得标准的统一和看法的一致，平原省并集中评产训练班一百三十多干部在滑县七区高平集等十二村进行了重点试验，以训练干部，吸取经验。河北省保定专区也训练了县干部七十八人，区干部三百二十六人，协助员九百九十人。这些，都为今年的勘地评产工作创造了有利条件。勘评前的准备工作是十分重要和不可忽略的。
    执行情况及其基本经验
    由于各区、县对勘地评产工作的重要性和省评产指示精神的了解有深有浅，还有去年秋征时间的拖长，使勘地评产工作的开展有迟有早，有好有坏，截至目前现有材料统计：山西省已完成评产的村数占全省总村数的百分之二十七点四，完成清丈的村庄占百分之四十七，河北省保定、沧县、定县、石家庄四个专区完成评产村占百分之十八点一四，平原省完成评产村占百分之二十二点一，新乡、安阳两专区结合颁发土地证，土地均经过了普丈。部分地区由于领导重视，广泛宣传政策，发动群众，地亩产量较前真实平衡。如山西省陵川县，全县土地较评丈前增加百分之七点四，产量提高百分之二十五点三。平原省原阳县土地较清丈前增加百分之十四，博爱县增加百分之二十一，沁阳县每亩平均产量评丈前为一点五四石，评丈后为二点○一石，使负担分配有了更可靠的依据。更重要的是由于勤劳增产和种植经济作物不增加负担政策的深入贯彻，直接刺激了植棉，解决了群众怕“负担没底多收多缴”的顾虑，并获得以下几点重要经验：（一）领导重视，亲自动手，负责干部深入现场，具体掌握情况，发现问题和及时解决问题。（二）群众反映：“产量真实好是好，就是真实了负担吃亏不好。”因此，必须克服过去“挤典型”的偏向。（三）不同地区，不同要求。凡有评产基础的地区，应充分分析研究旧材料，合理的保留，不合理的修正，没问题不必作否认过去，一切从头做起，经验证明是失败的。在新区应首先澄清地亩，如与评产结合进行，则往往顾此失彼。（四）先行重点试验，然后全面推行。如准备不足，而又普遍推行，经验证明是失败的。同时，必须力求一次基本上做好，不然一次不成，再评再改，则易使农民厌腻、不满，对生产不利。老区农民反映：“评产也评了十来八次了，光说固定，不知什么时候才能固定。”（五）注意各部门的配合，克服“单打一”的作风。河北省交河县创造出以生产为中心、带动建政和评产的范例。平原省安阳、新乡专区创造出结合颁发土地证、清丈土地的成功经验，证明：在老区把分地评产工作密切结合生产进行，在新区与土改和颁发土地证结合进行，完全符合农民的要求，所以工作也就容易做好。（六）把勘地评产的政策和办法，经过县人民代表会或区村农民代表会充分讨论，作成决议，并选举各级勘地评产委员会（有人民代表参加）具体执行，比之单纯召开干部会收效要大得多。经验证明：勘地评产工作是关系千百万农民生活和生产的大事，必须吸收广大农民参加，使之成为群众自己的事；这样才能做好，而运用土地站队（即划分等级）、联村勘评、组织联合勘查评议委员会是领导与群众相结合的最好的工作方法和组织形式。
    若干地区存在偏差有待纠正
    但若干地区存在不少偏差有待纠正：（一）不按具体情况办事，如河北省石家庄、衡水专区有些县向村分配产量要求，或机械以县为单位划等分级，并主观规定各等各级产量，不符合实际情况，遭受了群众反对。（二）不认真研究旧有负担基础的真实性、平衡性，盲目从头做起，走了弯路。（三）注意平衡忽视真实。如石家庄专区以山区迁就平原，以路西迁就路东，向低看齐，造成严重偷漏瞒产现象。（四）没有采用重点推动一般的工作方法，有的准备不够，全面开花（即普遍推行）形成自流；有的束手束脚，只做重点，忽视推动一般，形成迟缓，赶不上农民的要求。（五）忽视统计工作，有的地区评丈结束了，还不知评丈结果怎样，以致无法了解情况，分析订产真实程度，更不能及时检查，纠正偏向。（六）少数地区本位主义仍相当严重，甚至为了和邻区比较，有故意“筑高墙”（即把与外村或外区交界的地产量订的特别高）的现象，以致造成新的畸轻畸重现象。这些都应在秋征前加以调整纠正，以便在今年秋征中把公粮工作做到更加公平合理。
