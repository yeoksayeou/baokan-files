Xinhua News Agency, 10th: Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai has telegraphed the President of the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Jessup, and Secretary-General Trygve Lie, requesting that a representative from China be present when the Security Council discusses the case of a U.S. military aircraft intruding into Chinese airspace and strafing Chinese people. The telegram reads as follows:

To Mr. Jessup, President of the United Nations Security Council, and Secretary-General Trygve Lie, Lake Success, New York:

On August 31, 1950, the United Nations Security Council adopted the agenda item concerning the complaint by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China against the military aircraft of the United States invading the airspace of the People's Republic of China and strafing, killing, and wounding Chinese people, and damaging Chinese property. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the Chinese people. At the same time, it is the proposer and complainant in this complaint. Therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has the right and necessity to send its own delegation to participate in and attend the United Nations Security Council.

I now, on behalf of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, request the United Nations Security Council to ensure that a representative of the People's Republic of China is present to state opinions and participate in the discussion when the Security Council conducts the aforementioned agenda item. This is a procedural issue that must be resolved first. If the Security Council proceeds with the aforementioned agenda item without the presence and participation of a representative of the People's Republic of China, all resolutions made will be illegal and therefore invalid.

Respectfully submitted for your consideration.

Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
Beijing, September 10, 1950

　　周外长致电安理会
    讨论美机侵我领空案
    必须有我国代表出席
    【新华社十日讯】我中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长致电联合国安理会主席杰伯及秘书长赖伊，要求安理会在讨论美机侵犯我国领空并扫射我国人民案时，必须有我国代表出席。电文如下：纽约成功湖联合国安全理事会主席杰伯先生及秘书长赖伊先生：
    一九五零年八月三十一日联合国安全理事会业已通过将中华人民共和国中央人民政府控诉美国侵略朝鲜军队的军用飞机侵入中华人民共和国领空扫射，杀伤中国人民，损坏中国财产一案列入议程。中华人民共和国中央人民政府是代表中国人民的唯一合法政府，同时，又是这一控诉案的提案者和控诉者，故中华人民共和国中央人民政府有权利和必要派遣自己的代表团参加和出席联合国安全理事会。
    我现在代表中华人民共和国中央人民政府向联合国安全理事会提出要求：安全理事会在进行上述议程的时候，必须有中华人民共和国的代表出席陈述意见和参加讨论。这是程序上首先应解决的问题。安全理事会如果在没有中华人民共和国代表出席和参加讨论的情况下进行上述议程，则其所作的一切决议都将是非法的，因而也将是无效的。
    专此奉达，即希查照。
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
            一九五○年九月十日于北京
