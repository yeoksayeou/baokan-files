　　The report of the Chinese People's Delegation published on September 2nd already pointed out: "The victory of the Korean people is not accidental. Under the wise and correct leadership of General Kim Il-sung, and with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, five years of national construction and the improvement of people's lives should become the material basis of victory. The ideological preparation that completed this foundation, undoubtedly, was the long-term oppression of Japanese imperialism and the unparalleled brutality of the Rhee Syngman clique, which made the Korean people better at combining internationalism and patriotism, becoming incomparably sharp weapons for revolutionary struggle and national construction."

　　In the short five years after liberation, the Korean people have already overfulfilled two one-year national plans in 1947 and 1948 consecutively. The two-year national plan from 1949-50, which began last year, has also achieved remarkable results.

　　The formulation of the three national plans all learned from the Soviet Union and received the help of Soviet experts. The implementation of the national plans also naturally received Soviet assistance. One point worth special attention is how the assistance of brotherly countries differs from the so-called "aid" of imperialism.

　　Of course, the original economy of Korea was a typical colonial economy: an economy subordinate to and dependent on Japanese imperialism. The degree of subordination and dependence was almost the same as our Taiwan, and even greater than that of the Northeast. The reason is that in the later stages of the war of aggression against China, Japanese imperialism had wanted to make the Northeast its last base, so it had already begun to carry out some construction there as an independent operational unit. That kind of construction was naturally not suitable for the needs of the Chinese people today in essence, and it was not completed, but it had reduced some subordination and dependence. Until now, our provinces within the customs are still suffering from economic subordination and dependence, but that is only the subordination and dependence of a semi-colonial state. Compared to Korea, which was a Japanese colony for thirty-six years, it is much better. Therefore, transforming the Korean economy is a difficult task; the large-scale destruction by Japanese imperialism during its surrender further increased this difficulty.

　　One of the important goals of Soviet assistance to Korean construction was to eliminate its economic subordination and dependence, and to make it an independent and self-reliant economy - not only to be economically independent and self-reliant, but also to be technically independent and self-reliant. This is the case economically, and also in culture and education. The Soviet Union absolutely did not want to make the Korean economy shift from being subordinate to and dependent on Japanese imperialism in the past, to being subordinate to and dependent on the Soviet Union in the future. This is because under the socialist system, production is entirely for the happiness of the people at home, not for exploiting the people at home or even in other countries. Therefore, it naturally requires Korea to also produce for the happiness of its own people, neither exploiting the people nor depending on other countries.

　　In contrast is the so-called "aid" of the United States to China during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's rule. First, it wanted us to change from mainly relying on Britain, Japan... to completely relying on the United States. Secondly, it also wanted us not to rely on our own people but on the United States. Every American advisor, when speaking to Chinese people, boasted about how good American machines and materials were, how much better they were than British, Japanese, German, Belgian... and demanded that China buy American equipment completely in the future. Song Ziwen, the top war criminal representing American interests, once said that China's original factory equipment should be thrown into the river, and machines made by Chinese people were also useless, and only the United States could ship machines to China to carry out "industrialization." In their minds, even China's cotton and wheat were not good, and only American cotton could be used to supply China's yarn factories, and American wheat could be used to supply China's flour mills. Then China would not even be able to be a good agricultural country - that was a more egregious idea than Wallace's. This more egregious idea was precisely the policy that the United States was pursuing in China at that time. Chinese farmers suffered greatly under this policy, and Chinese yarn factories and flour mills are still suffering from subordination and dependence this year. Invariably, the Americans want India not to produce its own steel, but to rely on the American steel trust - the United States Steel Corporation - to supply them with steel. The Americans regard the Tata Iron and Steel Company in India, which is mainly invested by Britain, as a thorn in their side.

　　The so-called "aid" that the United States carried out in South Korea for the Rhee Syngman bandit gang was of course more blatant than what it carried out in China and India. In China and India, it had to pretend that we were independent countries on the surface; in South Korea, it was a military occupier, American soldiers could unscrupulously rape and plunder, creating incidents that were even bigger and more numerous than the Shen Chong incident and the collective rape incident in Hankou, and of course, it could openly plunder economically. That is the reason why South Korea's agriculture, industry, and commerce rapidly went bankrupt, and 1.5 million people suffered unemployment. The Chinese people understand this so-called "aid" with sugar-coated poison.

　　The national construction carried out by North Korea with the help of the Soviet Union is enviable. The goal of the 1949-50 plan was to increase industrial production to 133.5 percent of the Japanese imperialist rule era, to prepare a good foundation for the construction of the entire Korea after the achievement of peaceful unification; to develop a basic heavy industry, to strive for independence economically and technically at the same time, and also to greatly develop light industry to improve the people's living standards; in addition, it was also necessary to make revolutionary adjustments between various production departments, to seek balance between each other, and fundamentally eliminate the colonial nature of the economy. Agricultural production must also be increased to ensure the abundance of people's food and industrial raw materials sources. The improvement of culture, education, and health departments is of course also within the plan, which cannot be detailed here.

　　Some of the planned figures can and should be reported. In 1950, cotton cloth production was to be increased to 16.6 times that of 1944, silk was to be increased to 8.9 times, rubber shoes were to be increased to 35.8 times, and 378,872 houses were to be built. These are obviously directly used to improve people's lives.

　　The progress of the plan is astonishing. In the first half of 1950, the level of industrial production had reached four and a half times that of 1946, and had also increased by 17.5 percent compared to 1944 during the Japanese imperialist rule era. In the first half of 1950, the volume of railway transportation reached six and a half times that of the first half of 1946, while the volume of commodity circulation increased to 12.4 times that of the entire year of 1946. What is particularly worth pointing out is that in the first half of 1950, the level of steel production increased to 8.2 times that of 1946, and machine shipbuilding increased to 17.6 times, both far exceeding the Japanese imperialist rule era. The increase in these two figures is absolutely necessary to change the colonial economy into an independent and self-reliant economy. In the first half of 1950, North Korea's industrial production, including forestry production, already accounted for 55 percent of the entire national economy; the state-owned economy and the cooperative economy already accounted for 98 percent of the entire industrial and commercial economy.

　　After the land reform, agricultural production also greatly increased. Although there was an unprecedented drought in 1949, grain production still exceeded 20.9 percent of 1944 during the Japanese imperialist era, making North Korea, which had always been short of food, become surplus.

　　The rapid advancement of national construction and the rapid improvement of people's lives will of course expand political influence. Two years ago, the Korean people had already established a united central government - the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea - led by General Kim Il-sung through universal suffrage. The Rhee Syngman bandit gang has long been spurned by the people and relies solely on the support of American imperialist guns.

　　The development of production has also laid the foundation for the extremely stable wartime economy today, making it possible for the Korean people to cope with such a modern war without issuing a single additional banknote, and the price level immediately stabilized after fluctuating once. The development of industry has further enhanced the leading position of the working class, strengthened the people's organization and discipline, and guaranteed the abundant supply of troops to the front and the large increase in production and the extraordinary stability of order in the rear during wartime.

　　We should really learn from the Korean people, to learn how they are good at combining internationalism and patriotism, and also to learn their methods and efforts in building the country. We must also be vigilant, because imperialism is crazy. Although the United States has already received serious lessons in Korea, American planes still dare to invade our airspace and provoke us, is that not crazy? Basically, dying imperialism relies on expansionism to maintain its remaining life. If imperialism cannot make the oppressed peoples of the world accept its enslavement very docilely, it must launch wars. In the eyes of imperialism, the people's revolution demanding independence and freedom is its so-called "aggression." It must be suppressed with "police actions," just as the United States and its servants have done in Korea. Therefore, the only way for the oppressed people of the world to get rid of the fate of being enslaved is to resist. Imperialism is the deadly enemy of the people of the world, and that is absolutely correct.

　　Seeing the brutality of American planes and the cowardice of American prisoners of war, we feel one point: imperialism only becomes a paper tiger under the resistance of the people. If it is tolerated, or when it cannot be attacked, it is still a man-eating tiger! Imperialism must be overthrown so that the people of the world can have lasting peace. The concerted efforts of the people of the world will surely defeat the imperialist camp!

　　朝鲜人民胜利的物质基础
    章乃器
    九月二日发表的中国人民代表团的报告书已经指出：“朝鲜人民的胜利不是偶然的。在金日成将军英明正确的领导之下，在苏联大公无私的帮助之下，五年来的国家建设，人民生活的改善，应该成为胜利的物质基础。完成这一基础的思想准备，无疑的是日本帝国主义的长期压迫和美李的无比残暴，使得朝鲜人民更善于结合国际主义与爱国主义，成为了锐利无比的革命斗争和国家建设的武器。”
    朝鲜人民在解放以后的短短五年当中，已经连续在一九四七和一九四八年，超额完成了两个一年国家计划。去年开始进行一九四九——五○年两年的国家计划，成绩也是很辉煌的。
    三次国家计划的作成，都是向苏联学习而且得到苏联专家帮助的，国家计划的实施当然也得到苏联的帮助。这中间有一点值得大家特别注意，那就是：兄弟国家的帮助如何不同于帝国主义的所谓“援助”。
    当然，朝鲜原来的经济是典型的殖民地的经济：是从属、依靠于日本帝国主义的经济。从属性、依赖性之大，与我们的台湾差不多，而要比东北更大一些。理由是因为日帝在侵华战争的后期，曾经想把东北作为最后根据地，所以已经开始在那边进行了一些作为一个独立作战单位的建设。那种建设自然在本质上是不适宜于今天的中国人民的需要的，而且也并没有完成，但已经减少了一些从属性和依赖性。我们关内各省直到现在为止，在经济上都还吃从属性和依赖性的亏，那还不过是半殖民地的从属性和依赖性而已。比起做了三十六年日帝殖民地的朝鲜，是要好的多了。所以，改造朝鲜经济是一件困难的工作；日帝在投降时期的大量破坏更增加了这种困难。
    苏联帮助朝鲜的建设，重要目标之一就是要消灭它在经济上的从属性和依赖性，使它成为一个独立自主的经济——不但在经济上要能够独立自主，在技术上也要能够独立自主。在经济上如此，在文化教育上也是如此。苏联绝对没有要使朝鲜经济由过去从属、依赖于日帝，今后转过方向来从属、依赖于苏联。这是因为在社会主义制度之下，生产完全是为着国内人民的幸福，而不是为着剥削国内以至别国的人民。所以，它当然要求朝鲜也为自己人民的幸福而生产，既不剥削人民，也不依赖别的国家。
    与此恰好相反的是美帝在蒋匪帮统治时代对中国的所谓“援助”。首先，它要我们由过去主要的依赖英国、日本……变为完全依赖美国。其次，还要我们不要依赖自己的人民而依赖美国。每一个美国顾问向中国人说话，都是夸耀美国的机器、材料是如何好法，比起英国、日本、德国、比利时……好多少，要求中国以后完全买美国器材。代表美国利益的头等战犯宋子文，曾经说中国的原有工厂设备只好丢到江里去，中国人制造的机器也不中用，而只能由美国运机器到中国来进行“工业化”。在他们的心目中，甚至连中国的棉花、麦子都不好，而只好用美国棉花供给中国的纱厂，用美国麦子供给中国的面粉厂。那中国就连农业国都不能好好的做了——那是比华莱士更恶劣的一种想法。这种更恶劣的想法正是当时美帝在中国所推行的政策，中国的农民在这种政策之下吃了大亏，中国的纱厂和面粉厂直到今年还吃从属性和依赖性的亏。毫无二致的，美国人在印度是要印度不要生产自己的钢铁，而依赖美国的钢铁托辣斯——美国钢铁公司——供给他们以钢铁。美国人对于印度有了一个主要由英国投资的塔塔炼钢厂是视为眼中钉的。
    美帝在南朝鲜对于李承晚匪帮所进行的所谓“援助”，当然是比在中国和印度所进行的更要露骨了。在中国和印度，它在表面上还只好当作我们是独立国；在南朝鲜，它是一个军事占领者，美国兵可以肆无忌惮地奸淫掳掠，制造出来比沈崇事件和汉口集体强奸事件更大更多的事件，在经济上当然可以明目张胆地进行掠夺了。那就是南朝鲜农工商业迅速地陷于破产，一百五十万人遭遇失业的理由。这种毒药外面包糖衣的所谓“援助”，中国人民是懂得的。
    北朝鲜在苏联的帮助之下所进行的国家建设，是值得羡慕的。一九四九——五○年计划的目标，是要把工业生产提高到日帝统治时代的百分之一三三·五，要为争取到和平统一以后的全朝鲜建设准备好基础；要发展有基础的重工业，从经济上、技术上同时争取到独立，同时也要大量发展轻工业，以提高人民的生活水平；此外还要在各个生产部门之间作革命性的调整，求得彼此之间的平衡，根本扫除经济上的殖民地性。农业生产也要提高，以保证人民粮食和工业原料来源的充裕。文化、教育、卫生等部门的提高，当然也在计划之内，这里不能细说了。
    有些计划中的数字是可以而且值得报告的。一九五○年棉布生产要增加到一九四四年的十六倍点六，丝绢增加到八倍点九，胶鞋要增加到三十五倍点八，还要建造三七八、八七二所房子。这些显然都是直接用以提高人民生活的。
    计划进行的成绩是惊人的。一九五○年上半年的工业生产水平已经达到了一九四六年的四倍半，比日帝统治时代的一九四四年也增加了百分之十七点五。一九五○上半年的铁路运输量达到了一九四六年上半年的六倍半，而商品流通量则增加到一九四六年全年的十二倍点四。特别值得指出的是一九五○上半年的钢铁生产水平增加到一九四六年的八倍点二，机器造船增加到十七倍点六，都远远地超过了日帝统治时代。这两项数字的增加，是把殖民地经济改变为独立自主的经济所绝对必需的。在一九五○上半年，北朝鲜的工业生产连林垦生产在内，已经占全部国民经济的百分之五十五；国营经济和合作经济已经占全部工商业经济的百分之九十八。
    在土地改革以后，农业生产也大大的增加。一九四九年虽然遇到空前的旱灾，粮食生产仍要超过日帝时代的一九四四年的百分之二十点九，使得一向粮食不足的北朝鲜变成有余粮。
    国家建设的突飞猛进和人民生活的迅速改善，当然会扩大政治影响。在两年以前，朝鲜人民就已经通过普选，建立起来由金日成将军领导的举国一致的中央政权——朝鲜民主主义人民共和国最高人民会议。李承晚匪帮早已为人民所唾弃，而单纯依靠美帝枪杆撑腰了。
    生产的发展还奠定了今天战时经济极端稳定的基础，使得朝鲜人民在应付这样一个现代化的战争当中不需要增发一张钞票，物价在一度波动之后马上就稳定下去。工业的发展更提高了工人阶级的领导地位，加强了人民的组织力与纪律性，保证了战时前方兵源补充的充裕和后方生产的大量增加以及秩序的异常安定。
    我们真应该好好地向朝鲜人民学习，要学习他们善于把国际主义与爱国主义结合起来，还要学习他们建设国家的方法与努力。我们还必须提高警觉，因为帝国主义是疯狂的。尽管美帝在朝鲜已经得到了严重的教训，美国飞机依然敢于侵入我国领空向我国挑衅，那还不是疯狂？基本上，垂死的帝国主义是依靠扩张主义维持其残余生命的。帝国主义如果不能使全世界被压迫民族很驯服地接受它的奴役，就必须发动战争。在帝国主义的心目中，人民要求独立自由的革命，就是它的所谓“侵略”。就必须以“警察行动”加以弹压，有如美帝和它的仆从们在朝鲜所做的一样。因此，全世界被压迫人民如果要摆脱被奴役的命运唯一的道路就是反抗。帝国主义是全世界人民的死敌，这话是绝对正确的。
    看到了美国飞机的残暴，再看到了美国俘虏的懦怯，使我们感觉到一点：帝国主义是只有在人民的抗击之下才会变成一只纸老虎的。倘使宽容了它，或者还不能打击它的时候，它仍然是一只吃人的猛虎！必须打倒帝国主义，全世界人民才能有持久的和平。全世界人民的一致努力一定可以战胜帝国主义阵营！
