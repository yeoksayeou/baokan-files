How the Beijing Electric Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant's Trade Union Mobilized and Organized Workers to Launch a Competition
    Peng Zhensu

Under the leadership of the Party, the trade union of the Beijing Electric Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant mobilized and organized workers to launch a production competition focused on improving quality and reducing costs, starting from July 1st. This increased labor productivity and enabled the plant to complete its annual task four months ahead of schedule. The following is an introduction to the union's experience in mobilizing and organizing workers during the two-month competition.

    Recognizing the Significance of the Competition

In mid-June, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Industrial Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions all issued instructions to "Launch a competition to improve quality and reduce costs." Trade union cadres also attended lectures by Soviet experts and listened to Comrade Li Lisan's summary report at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions' production conference. The trade union combined the instructions from higher authorities and the content of the lectures with the plant's current practical situation, providing extensive lessons to the workers and organizing group discussions. This helped workers not only recognize the significant meaning of the competition itself but also understand that the competition was not a one-off campaign but a continuous effort to improve technology and tools to constantly increase production. During the discussions, the sheet metal workers' group set out a plan to transform six types of tools. Xuan Gong Zhao Qin then immediately modified the phoenix-headed knife for rotating dial knobs into a template knife, improving work efficiency from 48 minutes to just 5 minutes. When the lathe workers' group was making plans, they selected master craftsman Zhao Quanyong to be specially responsible for modifying knives, sparking a wave of technological improvement.

    From Working First and Planning Later to Planning First and Working Later

In the past, the administration was never timely in issuing plans. For example, the plans for January and February were only issued on January 15th, and the plans for March and April were also issued more than ten days late. Workers complained, "Half of the two months is spent working blindly." The trade union also realized that it was necessary to issue plans in advance to allow everyone to have ample opportunity to discuss them before making guarantees. They urged the administration to ensure that the plans for July and August were issued by June 20th. After the plans were issued, the trade union, through the group leaders, led each team in discussions. With the cooperation of propagandists and activists, each team formulated its own specific plans, put forward slogans guaranteeing the early completion of tasks and guaranteeing improved quality, and challenged each other. For example, the sheet metal workers and machinists both pledged to work according to plan and abide by labor discipline. The electricians pledged that roller coils would last for half a year without failure, and the riveters pledged to complete seven days' work in five days. Through slogans and challenge letters, the trade union also organized eight teams to sign joint contracts. With slogans, challenges, and joint contracts, everyone had a competition target, which allowed them to fully unleash their labor enthusiasm.

    In-depth Propaganda and Mobilization

Based on the experience of Northeast China and the Soviet Union, the trade union recognized the importance of doing a good job in propaganda and mobilization. In mid-June, the trade union decided to establish a propaganda group under the Cultural and Educational Department, and at the same time established more than a dozen forms of propaganda and mobilization, such as production record boards, production number charts, production dynamics, and large and small mobile red flags. In order to fully leverage the role of various forms, twenty-four activists were hired as propagandists to conduct oral mobilization at any time during production. The qualifications for propagandists were: having prestige among the masses and being able to play a leading role in production. Special attention was paid to inviting older workers, such as old foreman Zhang Zhiqin, who said that the master craftsmen were satisfied with every word he said, so his role as a propagandist was more effective. Propagandists held two discussion meetings every week to study the current central work and exchange work experience. Because each workshop had propagandists, it was very convenient to implement leadership intentions, such as putting forward slogans and challenges. The trade union went deep into the sheet metal and machine workers' teams to mobilize them, and immediately received a response from all the teams in the plant. Even the staff proposed to ensure that statistics kept up with production, the warehouse proposed to ensure prompt material requisition, and the guards proposed to ensure that they did not doze off during night patrols and did not leave their posts in wind and rain. The propagandists played a significant role in this work.

The propaganda group also regularly held various forums. Propagandists discussed the purpose of the meeting in advance and then went down to mobilize and prepare, and then inspired speeches at the meeting, so each time it played a certain role. For example, master craftsman Ding Jinqi and young worker Deng Naicang signed a master-apprentice contract through the master craftsman forum and are now the most typical good master-apprentice pair in the repair and manufacturing plant.

    Trade Union Committee Members Go Deep into the Workshops

If the trade union wants to lead the competition, it must understand the situation. Therefore, before the start of the movement, the trade union committee resolved to assign tasks according to each person's environment, go deep into each team, regularly check the production progress of each team, and count the production figures of each person and each team every five days, and promptly announce them to each workshop. If there was a sudden surge in production or failure to complete the task, further understanding was made, and if there was technological improvement, it was commended, and if there were difficulties, suggestions were made to the administration for improvement. Such in-depth work: on the one hand, could discover many shortcomings in the system, and on the other hand, consolidate everyone's emotions. For example, Zhang Liancheng, a sheet metal worker, used waste materials to make copper eyelets, which saved a lot of time compared to new materials. Young worker Liu Jingwen used to love to play and was slack in production. Since the number of figures were announced, he calculated his own excess number at all times, often arriving at the factory early to prepare for the work he was going to do today, and then did it when it was time to go to work. As a result, he completed 150% of the original plan in two months. Everyone said, "Liu Jingwen has changed."

    Several Experiences

1.  Through the competition, labor enthusiasm was generally brought into play. Many workers have broken through the original work hour standard of 100%. Some individuals exceeded the original standard by more than 350%. This fact proves that the past production efficiency was very low, and it was wrong to determine the work hour standard before the productive forces were improved. After the propagandists' mobilization and the report at the general meeting, the masses recognized that it was not possible to set a standard work hour at present. After discussion by the masses, a reward standard was temporarily set and the reward method was revised at the same time. This shows that only by doing a good job in the competition can we gradually move towards enterprise-based production management.

2.  Before the competition, many workers went to the trade union all day long for problems such as borrowing money, and the director could not be separated. The committee members who did not disengage from production became semi-detached. After the competition, the workers concentrated on production, and no one went to the trade union during working hours. The director could take the initiative to go deep into the workshop to understand the situation. Production committee member Li Huaxin used to be equal to being detached from production, but now he has exceeded the original plan by 280% in two months. Therefore, after the competition was launched, the trade union naturally got rid of its preoccupation with administrative affairs.

3.  After the competition was launched, the workers realized the value of technology and demanded to learn technology. The trade union's Youth Workers' Department and Cultural and Educational Department established technical learning classes, electrical learning classes, and drawing classes according to the requirements. As soon as the drawing class started, there were more than 70 people, listening quietly every day, taught jointly by three staff members. Everyone's enthusiasm was very high. In their spare time, many people were practicing drawing, and the staff and workers were even more united as a result.

4.  Each plan was discussed by the masses, and sometimes it had to be revised two or three times until everyone thought it was reasonable. The workers estimated their own strength and put forward slogans of guarantee, and sincerely put out their enthusiasm, so the competition was generally improved. This proves that: any work must be democratic to have power, and only when the trade union deeply mobilizes and organizes workers can the competition become a mass movement.

5.  During this competition, the issue of quality has been raised, and everyone has made great efforts. For example, the coils of the electricians' team did not break much even after being soaked in water during the rain, and the liaison contract of the eight teams of the North and South Motor Rooms also focused on quality, but not enough was done in the inspection of the implementation of the contract. In the future, we must better establish standard specifications, so the plant is preparing to further launch a competition to improve quality and reduce costs. (Draft of the Beijing News Agency)

　　京市电车公司修造厂工会怎样动员组织工人开展竞赛
    彭振绥
    京市电车公司修造厂在党的领导下，由工会动员组织了工人从七一开始展开提高质量，减低成本的生产竞赛，提高了劳动生产率，使全年任务提前四个月完成。现在把该厂工会在两个月的竞赛过程中，动员组织工人的经过和经验介绍如下。
    认清了竞赛的意义
    六月中，中共北京市委、工业局、市总工会都布置了“开展提高质量、减低成本的竞赛运动”，工会干部又听了苏联专家的讲演和李立三同志在全总生产会议上的总结报告，工会把上级指示和所听的报告，结合该厂目前实际情况给工人上大课，组织小组讨论，使工人除了认识到竞赛本身的重大意义外并说明了竞赛不是一件突击性的工作，而是经常用提高技术改进工具等方法，使生产不断上升。在讨论时案工小组就定出准备改造六种工具的计划，旋工赵琴当时就把旋转针盘木把的凤头刀改成样板刀，使工作效率由四十八分钟一个，改进到只用五分钟。旋工班订计划时选出老师父赵泉永专负责改刀工作，掀起改进技术的热潮。
    由先干活后计划到先计划后干活
    过去行政对布置计划总不及时，如一、二月份计划一月十五日才发下，三、四月份计划也晚发十几天。工友就反映：“两月里倒有半个月瞎干。”工会也认识到必须提前发下计划，使大家有充分讨论的机会，才可以提出保证的口号。就督促行政保证在六月二十日发下七、八月份的计划。计划发下后工会就通过小组长领导各班讨论，在宣传员和积极分子的配合下，各班都订出自己具体的计划，提出保证提前完成任务和保证提高质量的口号，并互相挑战，像案工、机工都提出保证按计划做活，遵守劳动纪律。电工提出滚子线圈保证半年不坏，铆工提出七天的活保证五天交。通过口号和挑战书，工会又组织了八班订立联系合同。有了口号、挑战和联系合同，每个人都有了竞赛目标，才能充分的发挥劳动热情。
    深入宣传鼓动
    根据我国东北和苏联的经验，工会认识了做好宣传鼓动工作的重要。六月中旬工会决定由文教部建立宣传组，同时建立了十几种宣传鼓动形式，如生产纪录牌、生产数字表、生产动态、大小流动红旗等。为了使各种形式能充分发挥作用，又聘请了二十四个积极分子当宣传员，随时在生产中进行口头鼓动。宣传员的条件是：在群众中有威信，在生产上能起带头作用。特别注重邀请老年工友，像老领班张治清，他说一句话老师傅都满意，所以他当宣传员就更能起作用。宣传员每星期开两次碰头会，研究目前中心工作和交流工作经验。因每个车间都有宣传员，在贯彻领导意图上有很大的便利，如提口号挑战，工会深入案工和机工两班进行动员，立即得到全厂各班的响应，像职员也提出保证统计跟着生产走，库房也提出领料保证迅速，警卫员也提出保证夜间巡厂不打瞌睡，风雨天不离岗位，宣传员在这件工作上的作用是很大的。
    宣传组又经常召开各种座谈会，宣传员事先讨论会议要达到的目的，然后再到下面动员准备，会上又启发发言，所以每次都起了一定的作用。如老师傅丁金岐和青工邓乃仓就是通过老师傅座谈会订立了师徒合同，现在是修造厂最典型的一对好师徒。
    工会委员深入车间
    工会要想领导竞赛，必须了解情况，所以在运动开展前工会委员会就决议按各人环境分工，深入各班，经常检查各班生产进度，五天统计一次各人和各班的生产数字，及时公布到各车间，有突击情况或没完成任务的即作进一步了解，有改进技术的就表扬，有困难的就建议行政改善。这样深入工作：一方面能发现很多制度上的缺点，另外也巩固了大家的情绪。如案工张连城利用废料做铜眼圈比新料省很多时间。青工刘静文过去最爱玩，对生产上就松懈，自从公布数目字后，他就时刻计算自己的超额数，时常提前到厂做准备工作，预备好今天要干的活，到上班时间就干，结果两个月完成原定计划的百分之一百五十，大家都说：“刘静文变了。”
    几点体会
    一、通过竞赛普遍发挥了劳动热情，很多工友都突破了原定工时标准的百分之百，有的个人超额超过了百分之三百五十，这个事实证明，过去的生产效率很低，在生产力没有提高以前便确定工时标准，是错误的。经宣传员的动员和开大会报告，群众都认清目前还不可能定出标准工时，经过群众讨论，暂时定出奖励标准，同时进行修改奖励办法。这说明只有搞好竞赛才能渐渐走向企业化的生产管理。
    二、竞赛前很多工友为借支等问题，整天找工会，主任不能分身，不脱离生产的委员变成了半脱产。竞赛后，工友们都专心生产，工作时间没人再到工会，主任可以主动的深入到车间了解情况，生产委员李华鑫过去等于脱产，现在两个月超过原计划的百分之二百八十，所以竞赛开展后工会自然的摆脱了事务主义。
    三、竞赛开展后工友们都认识到技术的宝贵，要求学习技术。工会青工部、文教部根据要求成立了技术学习班、电学学习班和画图班。画图班一开课就有七十多人，每天安静的听课，由三个职员联合教授，大家情绪都很高，业余时间很多人在练习画法，职工因此也更加团结了。
    四、每个计划都是通过群众讨论，有时要修改两三次，直到大家认为合理为止。工友们估计自己的力量提出保证的口号，真心拿出热情来，所以竞赛才会普遍提高，这证明了：任何一件工作都必须发挥民主才有力量，只有工会深入动员组织工人，竞赛才会成为群众性的运动。
    五、在这一段竞赛中已经提出了质量问题，大家也做了很大的努力，像电工班的线圈下雨虽经过水泡并没有坏多少，南北车房八班的联系合同也以质量为主，但在贯彻合同的检查方面做得很不够，今后还要更好的建立标准规格，所以该厂准备进一步展开提高质量减低成本的竞赛。（京市新闻处稿）
