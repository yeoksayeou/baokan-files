　　Model Worker He Shigu of the Ordnance Industry

    ——Introduction to Industrial Representatives at the National Congress of Labor Models, Peasants and Soldiers, No. 8

    He Shigu is only thirty-two years old this year and is a member of the Chinese Ordnance Industry Trade Union, and Deputy Director of the Artillery Section of a certain Ordnance Repair Department. Since January of this year, in just over eight months, he has successively created and improved seven important tools, which have played a huge role in supporting the front lines and building the factory.

    He Shigu is a fine worker.

    In December 1949, the factory had no tasks, and the workers' hands were itching with idleness. On January 6, 1950, when the workers heard that the tasks were coming, they were so happy that they clapped their hands and cheered. But when they learned that it was an urgent and arduous batch of artillery repair tasks, the workers felt embarrassed and some retreated. Because with the factory's limited manpower and equipment, it was very difficult to complete the task. Old He went to the homes of more than a dozen workers to persuade and mobilize them. Old worker Fu Jinzhong was sick, and Old He bought gifts to visit him, asking him to take good care of himself so that he could recover soon and rush to complete the task. The workers were moved and began to actively repair the artillery. They worked from morning till night, and one person could only wipe the × gate gun, let alone repair it. This was a waste of materials and exhausting. The task could still not be completed. Seeing this situation, He Shigu was in a state of anxiety.

    Old He's wife told people, "The person (referring to Old He) seemed to be going crazy. He couldn't hear anything at home." On the afternoon of January 9th, he was sitting at home drinking tea, unconsciously turning the teacup in his hand while thinking about how to improve the tools. Suddenly he thought, "If the hand can turn the teacup, why can't the gun barrel be turned by a machine?" He immediately took chopsticks, dipped them in tea, and started drawing on the table. His wife called him to eat, but he didn't hear her three times in a row. That night, he designed the machine drawing for rotating the gun barrel. At midnight, he braved the heavy snow to inspect materials in the waste pile, find good things, and measure the sizes, and then came back to continue designing. After finishing two packs of cigarettes, the design was finally successful. After going to work, he talked to the workers about his ideas, absorbed their experience, and finally successfully made the gun barrel polishing machine, which increased work efficiency by fifty times. As a result, the urgent task was completed half the time in advance, which strongly supported the front lines.

    The successful manufacture of the gun barrel polishing machine gave He Shigu great encouragement. However, this machine can only wipe rotatable gun barrels. Like mountain and field artillery and places with edges and grooves, they still have to be polished manually. At this time, a photograph from a Soviet factory gave him great inspiration. One day, he went to the Hubei China-Soviet Friendship Association to visit a Soviet photo exhibition and saw a sandblasting worker wearing rubber clothes, wearing a mask, and using an air gun to polish the newly cast engine shell in front of him. Old He went to see it four times in a row. After returning, he studied with technicians Qiu Jinzhou and Huang Zhide and finally made a sandblasting machine, using air pressure to spray sand onto various complex workpieces through pipes, which increased work efficiency by another fifty times.

    In March, the higher authorities handed down a batch of direct-fire artillery. After repair, there were no sights, but the artillery was in urgent need. He, without optical equipment, used his brains to successfully imitate the American "37" direct-fire artillery sight, so that these cannons could exert their power and hit the enemy.

    Subsequently, he made an air compressor and a sprayer for painting, which greatly improved work efficiency many times. By August 15th of this year, he and technician Dong Rongsheng had successfully researched a recoil force inspection machine. This machine can save the shells used for live-fire tests and recoil force adjustments, and can reduce labor, time, and various costs during test firing. This is a considerable figure.

    However, He Shigu's process of creating and improving tools was not all smooth sailing. When he was disassembling the engine of a broken tank, preparing to convert it into an air compressor, a leading comrade pointed his nose and asked him: "He Shigu, tell me honestly, how much stuff have you ruined?" When trial-producing the recoil inspection machine, he wanted to use a scrapped anti-aircraft gun rocker, which was also obstructed. When designing the test bomb, the plan was submitted to the Engineering Section, and the above approved it: "Not very confident, please instruct the factory director." After the test bomb was successfully developed, the responsible comrade of the Engineering Section refused to participate in the test firing, and arbitrarily believed that the test bomb had no impact force, could not test whether the gun mount would have a vacancy, and could not test the recoil force. However, He Shigu was not discouraged by the obstruction and accusations of individuals. With the support and encouragement of the trade union cadres, he always held the will to serve the people and continued to work hard, fully demonstrating the strong and courageous spirit of the working class.

　　兵工劳模贺世古
    ——工农兵劳模大会工业代表介绍之八
    贺世古今年才三十二岁，是中国兵工工会会员，某军械修械部炮间副主任。他从今年一月起，短短的八个多月时间，先后创制和改良重要工具七种，对支援前线和建设厂子起了极大作用。
    贺世古是一个好样的工人。
    一九四九年十二月厂里没任务，工人两手闲得发痒。一九五○年一月六日工友们听说任务下来了，乐得拍手叫好。但是当他们知道了是一批紧急而又艰巨的修炮任务时，工友们感到为难，有些退缩。因为厂里这点人力，这点设备，是很难完成任务的。老贺就分别到十几个工友家里去进行说服动员。傅金忠老工友病了，老贺又买了礼物去看他，要他好好养病，以便早日痊愈好去赶任务。工友们被感动了，开始积极修炮。一天累到晚，一个人只能擦×门炮，还谈不上修，既浪费材料，又累人，任务还是不能完成。贺世古看到这种情形，心里急的团团转。
    老贺的老婆告诉人说：“人（指老贺）都像要想疯了，家里什么事他都听不进耳朵里。”一月九日下午，他正坐在家里喝茶，一面无意识地把茶杯拿在手上转，一面想着如何改进工具。猛然他想起了“手可以使茶杯转动，炮筒为什么不可以拿机器转动呢？”他立即拿了筷子，沾着茶水在桌子上画起图来。他女人叫他吃饭，一连叫了三次他都没听见。当晚他就设计转动炮筒的机器图样。到半夜的时候，他又冒着大雪到废料堆去察看材料，找好东西，量好尺码，回来又继续设计。两包香烟抽完了，图样也设计成功了。上班后，他把自己想的办法谈给工人听，吸取工人的经验，终于胜利制出炮筒打光机，工作效率提高了五十倍。结果提前一半时间完成了紧急任务，有力地支援了前线。
    炮筒打光机制造成功，给了贺世古很大的鼓舞。但是这个机器只能擦可以转动的炮筒。像山野炮等炮身以及有棱角带槽的地方，仍得用人工打磨。这时候苏联工厂的一张照片给了他极大的启示。有一天他到湖北中苏友协去参观苏联图片展览，看到一个翻砂工人穿着橡皮衣服，带着面罩，拿了空气枪对准面前新翻出的引擎壳在打光。老贺一连跑去看了四次。他回来后就和技工邱金洲、黄志德研究，终于制出喷砂打光机，利用空气压力由管子把砂子喷射到各种复杂的工作物上，工作效率又提高了五十倍。
    三月间，上级交下一批平射炮，修好后没有瞄准器，而炮又急需。老贺在没有光学设备的条件下，开动脑筋，仿制了美国“三七”平射炮瞄准镜成功，使这些大炮都能发挥威力，命中敌人。
    接着，他制成了喷漆用的空气压缩机、喷油机，提高工作效率很多倍。到今年八月十五日，他又和技工董荣生研究复座力检查机成功，这种机器可以省掉实弹试射和调整复座力所用去的炮弹，可以减少人工、时间和试炮时的各种费用，这是相当惊人的一笔数字。
    但是贺世古在创造与改良工具过程中，并不是一帆风顺的。当他正拆卸一辆破坦克上的引擎，预备把它改装成空气压缩机时，有一位领导同志就指着鼻子问他：“贺世古，你老老实实说，你究竟搞坏过多少东西？”试制复座检查机时，他要利用一架报废高射炮摇架，亦遭到阻挠。在设计试验弹，把计划呈报给工务科，上面批下来：“信心不大，请厂长指示。”试验弹研究成功，工务科负责同志竟拒绝参加试炮，武断地认为试验弹没有冲击力，不能测验炮架是否会发生空位，不能测验复座力。但是，贺世古并没有因为个别人的阻挠和指责而灰心丧气，在工会干部的支持和鼓舞下，他始终抱着为人民服务的意志，继续努力，充分表现出工人阶级坚强、果敢的伟大气魄。
