　　Peace Signature Campaign Penetrates Deep into the Vast Rural Areas

　　Broad Masses of Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing Denounce the Crimes of American Imperialism
　　Peace Signature Campaign Continues to Unfold in Various Villages
    [Our Newspaper News] After the news of American planes invading our nation's airspace and killing and wounding our compatriots reached the rural areas of the suburbs of Beijing, it aroused the anger of the broad masses of farmers, who unanimously denounced the crimes of American imperialism.
    Liu Jinrong, a model worker representative from the suburbs of Beijing, and village cadres read the newspaper carefully every day and read the news of the American planes' atrocities to those who were illiterate. Nearly two-thirds of the people in their village knew about this matter. The farmers all believed that American soldiers were pampered and could not fight, so they were quickly being driven into the sea by the Korean People's Army; MacArthur was the third transportation captain after Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee, but he was directly responsible for transportation tasks. Liu Jinrong said: "We must tell the American imperialists that we, the liberated Chinese people, are not afraid of being intimidated by imperialism. We have the strength to repel any aggressor, just like we defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries." The farmers all vowed to defend their peaceful lives.

    Xu Dama, a military dependent from Yijie outside Andingmen in the northern suburbs, said: "American imperialism can't defeat the Korean People's Army, so it indiscriminately bombs peaceful residents, and now it has bombed us. It is as black-hearted as the Japanese devils and will end up like the Japanese devils." Farmer Yan Shuxiu said, "American imperialism always sees us as a piece of meat, staring at us like a dog all day long, wanting to invade us. It is dreaming, and it will never succeed, because the people all oppose it." Village cadres from Liulangzhuang and Xu Gengsheng, a farmer from the Fourteenth District, both disdainfully despise the American invading army, believing that our heroic People's Liberation Army definitely has the strength to defeat it. The deputy village chief said: "Chairman Mao safeguards the interests of our people and does not want to fight, because even a bullet belongs to our people; but if someone really comes to fight us, we will take out everything." Farmer Yin Enbai and Youth League member Wang Qikuan unanimously protested against American imperialist aggression and vowed to work hard to produce and support the People's Liberation Army in removing the scourge of American imperialism.

    The farmers of Xinxiao Village in the Eleventh District of the suburbs of Beijing are extremely concerned about the American imperialists' atrocities of invading our national airspace. Village Chief Peng Yuechen held a discussion with several farmers while holding a newspaper. Chen Xianglu, the director of the farmers' association, said: "We farmers must express our attitude: We must resolutely oppose the American imperialists' atrocities in the Northeast. 'A life for a life, debts must be repaid.' We must remember this blood debt." Peng Yuechen said: "This is the American imperialists' death throes, just like a chicken kicking its claws after being stabbed. We farmers must work hard to produce, support the front line, and liberate Taiwan." Cao Jianrong, a farmer representative from the Second Beijing Municipal People's Congress, said: "People all over the world have seen the crimes of American imperialism in invading Korea and our Chinese people. American imperialism is the enemy of the people of the world. We farmers must support the front line and eliminate the American imperialist aggressors." Fifty thousand people in the Eleventh District participated in the peace signature campaign, accounting for more than sixty-seven percent of the district's population. In August alone, 19,800 people signed their names. Farmers in Shitaizhuang wrote on the signature book: "We have turned over and gained land after the land reform, and we can no longer allow American imperialism to invade us." Li Jincheng, a representative of the rural cooperative in the Eleventh District, said: "The Chinese people are now the masters of the country, and all territorial waters, airspace, and land belong to us. Foreign Minister Zhou's protest against American imperialism truly represents the opinions of our people. American imperialism must punish the murderers and compensate for the losses."
    Zhang Nongxu, the street chief of Xichang'an Street in Nanyuan Town, said: "We must continue to carry out the peace signature campaign and work hard to produce, to show our farmers' determination to oppose American imperialist aggression." On the evening of August 28, the street administrative team leaders held a meeting to discuss continuing to expand the peace signature campaign and widely publicizing the American imperialists' aggressive atrocities. Regarding the number of peace signatures in Nanyuan, on the 27th alone, Longzhuashu Village in the town had 775 signatures; Weizi Village had all 733 villagers sign; and Wudian Village had 1,718 signatures. The number of signatures in the three villages accounted for more than 80 percent of the town's total population.

    When a farmers' association group leader and three or four farmers from Moshi Village in the suburbs of Beijing were discussing the American planes invading our airspace, they said: "The feudal forces of China for thousands of years have been defeated by us, and Chiang Kai-shek is about to be finished. Are we still afraid of American imperialism!" Village cadre Chen Yun said: "American imperialism's invasion of us has aroused the opposition of more Chinese people. Our participation in the peace signature campaign is to let American imperialism see our strength. There are often reports in the newspaper that foreign dockworkers refuse to transport munitions for imperialism, which shows that workers all over the world are of one heart, and American imperialism is isolated. What are we still afraid of!" Village cadre Gong Yunsheng said to some of the villagers who were worried after seeing in the newspaper that the American planes bombing Korea was very tragic: "We are standing on our own vast land, with so many people. Are we still afraid of American imperialist bombing! We must defeat American imperialism."

　　京郊广大农民指斥美帝罪行
    各村和平签名运动继续展开
    【本报讯】美机侵犯我国领空，杀伤我同胞的消息传到京郊农村后，激起了广大农民的愤怒，同声指斥美帝的罪行。
    京郊劳模代表刘金荣和村干部们，每天都关心地看报，并把美机暴行的消息念给不识字的人听，他们那一村差不多三分之二的人都知道这件事情。农民们都认为美国兵娇生惯养，打不了仗，所以快被朝鲜人民赶下海去了；麦克阿瑟是继蒋介石、李承晚之后的第三个运输大队长，不过是直接担负运输任务而已。刘金荣说：“我们要告诉美帝，我们已解放了的中国人民是不怕帝国主义吓唬的。我们有力量打退任何侵略者，像打国民党反动派一样。”农民们都决心保卫自己的和平生活。

    北郊安定门外一街军属徐大妈说：“美帝打不过朝鲜人民军，就滥炸和平居民，现在竟炸到我们头上来了。它像日本鬼子一样黑了心，也会像日本鬼子一样完蛋。”农民阎树秀说：“美帝总看我们是块肉，终日像一只狗样的瞅着我们想侵略。它是在做梦，永远不成了，因为老百姓都反对它。”六郎庄的村干部和十四区的农民许根生都愤恨地蔑视美侵略军，认为咱们英勇的人民解放军一定有力量打败它。副村长说：“毛主席维护咱们人民的利益，不愿打仗，因为就是一颗子弹也是咱们人民的；可是要真有人来打我们，咱们一切都要拿出来。”农民尹恩柏和青年团员王七宽都一致抗议美帝侵略，并且决心努力生产，支援解放军除去美帝这个祸害。

    京郊十一区新宫村的农民们对美帝侵犯我国领空的暴行，感到异常的关切。村长彭月臣拿着报纸和几个农民展开了讨论。农会主任陈祥禄说：“我们农民要表示我们的态度：美帝在东北这种暴行，我们要坚决反对。‘杀人偿命，欠债还钱。’我们要记下这笔血债。”彭月臣说：“这是美帝的临死挣扎，就像鸡挨刀以后蹬爪子一样。我们农民一定努力生产，支援前线，解放台湾。”京市二届三次代表会的农民代表曹建荣说：“全世界人民都看清了美帝侵略朝鲜和我国人民的罪恶，美帝是我们全世界人民的敌人，我们农民一定支援前线，消灭美帝侵略者。”十一区参加和平签名的有五万人，占全区人口百分之六十七强。八月份一月有一万九千八百人签了名。石太庄农民在签名书上写着：“我们在土改后分得土地翻了身，可不能再允许美帝侵略我们。”十一区农村合作社代表李金城说：“中国人民现在成了国家的主人，一切领海、领空、领土都是我们自己的。周外长的对美帝的抗议真正代表了我们人民的意见，美帝必须惩办凶手、赔偿损失。”
    南苑镇西长安街街长张农许说：“我们一定继续开展和平签名并努力生产，表示我们农民反对美帝侵略的决心。”八月二十八日晚，街行政组长开会讨论继续扩大和平签名，和将美帝的侵略暴行广泛地宣传。南苑和平签名人数，仅二十七日一日，该镇龙爪树村即有七百七十五人签名；苇子村全村有七百三十三人；庑店村有一千七百十八人签名。三村签名人数占该镇总人口百分之八十以上。

    京郊模势口村的一个农会小组长和三、四个农民谈论美机侵犯我领空的事情时说：“中国几千年来的封建势力都被我们打垮了，蒋介石也快要完了，还怕他美帝吗！”村干陈云说：“美帝侵犯咱们，激起了更多的中国人民的反对。咱们参加和平签名，就是叫美帝看看咱们的力量。报上常常有外国码头工人拒绝代帝国主义运军火的消息，这表示全世界工人都是一条心，美帝是孤立的，我们还怕它什么！”村干龚云生向村里一些看到报上说美机轰炸朝鲜很惨有些发愁的群众说：“我们是站在自己这么宽广的土地上，有这么多的人民，还怕美帝轰炸么！我们一定要把美帝打败的。”
