Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, September 23rd: The First Detachment of the Central People's Government Southwest Nationalities Visiting Group arrived in Kangding and Xichang on the 13th and 19th of this month, after departing from Ya'an in early September. When one team of the detachment arrived in Kangding, the entire city was bedecked with five-star red flags, and the streets and lanes were plastered with slogans welcoming the visiting group. People of all ethnic groups gathered in the streets to welcome them. Representatives of the Tibetan and Hui ethnic groups immediately presented flags to the visiting group. Losang Kanbu of the Lihua County Lamasery, representatives of the seven major lamaseries of Kangding, and Living Buddhas Zhouyang, Jiangyang, and Zhouzeng presented Hada (a silk scarf, regarded as a highly esteemed gift by Tibetans) to the head of the group, Liu Geping. Tibetan compatriots played the most solemn ceremonial music and sang songs such as "Following Mao Zedong" and "Welcome Visiting Group."

Another team of the detachment set off from Ya'an, crossed the Dadu River, traversed the Yi banner residential area, and arrived in Xichang. Along the way, they were warmly welcomed by Yi compatriots. On the 12th, when the team passed through Yuexi County, more than 200 representatives of the Tibetan, Hui, and 13 branches of the Yi ethnic group lined up outside the city to welcome them, shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao!" in the Yi language. The streets of the city were plastered with slogans written in Yi script, such as "Long Live the Central People's Government!" and "Support the Nationalities Policy of the Central People's Government." On the 15th, when the team passed through Luguzhen in Mianning, representatives of six Yi branches came from hundreds of miles away to welcome them. In the above two places, the team held forums with representatives of the Yi, Tibetan, and Hui ethnic groups to listen to the representatives of the ethnic groups' accusations against the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and their opinions on future ethnic work.
