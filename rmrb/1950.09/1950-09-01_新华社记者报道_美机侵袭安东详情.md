Xinhua News Agency report:

Xinhua News Agency, Andong, August 31st: This reporter reports on the details of the U.S. aircraft's invasion of China's airspace on August 27th, strafing Chinese compatriots at Andong Airport, stating: On August 27th, aircraft of the U.S. invading forces in Korea twice intruded into the airspace over Andong City and its suburbs on the right bank of the Yalu River, and in an intrusion at 4:40 p.m., committed a bloody crime of killing and wounding 22 of our compatriots.

At 2:30 p.m. on the 27th, a U.S. B-29 bomber first flew over Andong City, circling and reconnoitering for a week. At 4:40 p.m., two U.S. P-51 aircraft flew over Andong Airport, suddenly diving to a low altitude of about 200 meters above the ground and brutally strafing our compatriots.

When the U.S. aircraft began strafing, Jiang Lihong, instructor of the Andong Airport Fire Brigade, and three other firefighters were on the airport. When the sound of bullets fired by the U.S. aircraft came from behind, they quickly lay down and were not hit, but twenty-two airport workers dozens of meters in front of them were caught off guard and hit by the U.S. aircraft's bullets. Workers Wang Guanzhong, Sun Zilin (both Wang and Sun are from Wulongbei Village, Wulongbei District, Andong City, Wang is 18 years old, Sun is 20 years old), and Li Xiuguo (from Gushan District, Andong County, 18 years old) and three others died on the spot. Wang Guanzhong was hit in the head, and his skull was shattered. In the strafing by the U.S. aircraft, which lasted two minutes, nineteen other workers were injured, including worker Sun Yugui, who suffered severe injuries to his left arm, his spleen was shattered, and he bled excessively, unfortunately dying shortly after being taken to the hospital. In this air raid, two of our trucks were also damaged.

The crime of U.S. aircraft invading our country's airspace and strafing our compatriots cannot be denied by the U.S. government. Jiang Lihong, the instructor of the Andong Airport Fire Brigade, who experienced and witnessed the U.S. aircraft's atrocities, picked up two spent cartridges on the spot after the U.S. aircraft strafed. The cartridge is 10 mm long and 2 mm in diameter at the base, with the letters 54TW on it. The crime of the U.S. aircraft's attack on Andong Airport has been photographed by reporters from the Liaodong Mass Daily.

    美机侵袭安东详情
    【新华社安东三十一日电】本社记者报道八月二十七日美国飞机侵犯我国领空，在安东机场扫射我国同胞的详情称：八月二十七日，美国侵略朝鲜军队的飞机，曾两度侵入鸭绿江右岸安东市及郊区的上空，并在下午四时四十分的一次侵袭中，造成杀伤我国同胞二十二人的血腥罪行。
    二十七日下午两点三十分，首先有美国Ｂ——２９轰炸机一架，飞来安东市上空盘旋侦察一周。到下午四点四十分，又有美国Ｐ——５１飞机两架，飞来安东机场上空，并突然俯冲至距地面二百公尺左右的低空，向我同胞施行残暴的扫射。
    当美机开始扫射时，我安东机场消防队的指导员姜礼洪和其他三个消防队员正在机场上。当美机发射的子弹声从背后传来时，他们便迅速卧倒，幸未被击中，但在他们面前几十公尺处的二十二名机场工人，因骤不及防，为美机子弹所击中。工人王管忠、孙子林（王、孙均系安东市五龙背区五龙背村人，王年十八岁，孙年二十岁）、李秀国（安东县孤山区人，年十八岁）等三人当场牺牲。王管忠被击中头部，头颅被炸碎。在美机前后历时两分钟的扫射中，尚有十九名工人被击伤，其中工人孙玉贵左膊上部重伤，脾脏被炸碎，流血过多，在抬到医院后不久即不幸牺牲。在这次空袭中，尚有我国卡车二辆被击坏。
    美飞机侵入我国领空并扫射我国同胞的罪行决不是美国政府所能抵赖的。经历并目击美机这次暴行的安东机场消防队指导员姜礼洪，在美机扫射后当场就拾得了两颗弹壳，该弹壳长十公厘、底直径二公厘，上有５４ＴＷ的字样。美机这次侵袭安东机场的罪行，已由辽东大众报社记者摄制成照片。
