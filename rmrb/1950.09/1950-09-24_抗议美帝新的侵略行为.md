　　Protest Against U.S. Imperialism's New Act of Aggression
    On the 22nd of this month, U.S. planes bombed Andong City on the northeastern border. This is another blatant act of aggression by U.S. imperialism against the People's Republic of China. The entire Chinese people express their utmost anger at this insane crime of U.S. imperialism.
    On August 27th, U.S. planes already strafed Andong, Ji'an and other cities on the Sino-Korean border, causing great casualties to our people. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, sent a telegram to the United Nations Security Council on the same day to accuse the U.S. planes of strafing, and lodged a serious protest with the U.S. government. Now, U.S. imperialism not only does not repent, but has become even more insane, carrying out heinous bombings of our peaceful cities. This shows that U.S. imperialism is deliberately expanding its armed aggression against China, and thus it has once again exposed itself as a hideous aggressor in front of the whole world and the entire Chinese people. The Fifth Session of the United Nations General Assembly is now in session, and we demand that the United Nations General Assembly sanction the new act of aggression by the United States against the People's Republic of China.
    The Chinese people will never forget this newly added blood debt, and must demand that U.S. imperialism bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

　　抗议美帝新的侵略行为
    本月二十二日，美机竟到东北边境安东市进行轰炸。这是美帝国主义对中华人民共和国又一次的露骨的侵略行为。全中国人民对于美帝国主义这样疯狂的罪行，表示万分的愤怒。
    八月二十七日，美机已经在中朝边境安东、辑安等城市，进行了扫射，造成我方人民很大的伤亡。中央人民政府外交部长周恩来曾于当日致电联合国安理会控诉美机扫射，并向美国政府提出严重的抗议，现在美帝国主义不但不加改悔，反而更加疯狂，对我和平城市实行罪恶的轰炸。这说明，美帝国主义蓄意对中国扩大武装侵略，因而它再一次在全世界与全中国人民面前暴露自己是一个面目狰狞的侵略者。联合国第五届大会正在开会，我们要求联合国大会制裁美国对中华人民共和国新的侵略行为。
    中国人民永远不会忘记这一笔新添的血债，而且必须要求美帝国主义负担因此而来的一切后果。
