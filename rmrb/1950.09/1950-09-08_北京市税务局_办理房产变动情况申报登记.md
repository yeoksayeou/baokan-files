　　Beijing Municipal Taxation Bureau
    Handling Declaration and Registration of Property Ownership Changes
    The Beijing Municipal Autumn Property Tax will be levied starting on the 16th of this month. Considering that in the past, some households failed to promptly declare and correct changes in property rights and usage to the taxation bureau, resulting in taxpayers having to make temporary trips back and forth to handle correction procedures, the Municipal Taxation Bureau has specifically stipulated that from today (the 8th) until the 15th of this month, there will be a declaration and registration period for changes in property ownership. During the specified period, whether there is a change in property rights or a change in usage, a declaration and registration must be made in accordance with the prescribed methods. If it is handled within the specified period, the autumn property tax can be levied according to the actual situation after registration. If the declaration is made after the deadline, it will have to wait until the next season to be changed.

　　北京市税务局
    办理房产变动情况申报登记
    京市秋季房产税将于本月十六日开征。市税局鉴于过去有一些户，因房屋产权及使用情况变动，未能及时向税务局申报改正，致使纳税义务人临时往返办理更正手续，特规定自今（八）日起至本月十五日止，为房产变动情况申报登记期限。在限期内，无论是产权变更或使用情况变更，均须按照规定办法办理申报登记。如在规定期内办理者，秋季房产税即可按照登记后实际情况征收，倘若逾期申报，则须等到下季才能变更。
