(Comprehensive report by this newspaper) In the production competition to greet National Day, Chinese railway workers have already achieved brilliant results. The production competition movement in the Northeast railway system has generally spread to various bureaus, sections, and stations. Units such as the Jiamusi Engineering Section, Sujiatun Electrical Section, and Mudanjiang Yimianpo West Road Maintenance Area have completed their annual tasks ahead of schedule in the competition. The workers are united and fighting to further eliminate accidents, save expenses, complete tasks, and improve efficiency.

The entire staff of the Jiamusi Engineering Section worked together and successfully completed the annual production task—159 kilometers and 476 meters of the main line, 56 kilometers and 197 meters of the side line, and 197 sets of turnouts—at 17:00 on September 4th. The entire staff of the section specifically wrote a letter to Chairman Mao reporting their production achievements and guaranteed to further improve the quality of the line, striving to improve the line quality to 2, 5, 3 (that is, excellent accounting for 20 percent, good accounting for 50 percent, and qualified accounting for 30 percent) or more by October 1. The Shenyang Sujiatun Electrical Section completed its annual task ahead of schedule at the end of August. The production task for signal machines was originally set at eight, but the actual completion was fourteen; for centralized turnouts, thirty sets were planned, but fifty-two sets were completed; for non-centralized turnouts, thirty sets were planned, but forty-five sets were completed; for wooden wire troughs, 1,400 meters were planned, but 4,000 meters were completed. The budgeted expenditure of the financial plan was 601 million yuan (Northeast currency, same below), but the actual expenditure was only more than 440 million yuan, saving the country more than 160 million yuan. The section has now put forward six guarantees, including "saving the country another 300 million yuan in the completion of 800 signals," as a gift to greet National Day. The Mudanjiang Yimianpo West Road Maintenance Area completed its annual road maintenance work on September 3, including 1 kilometer and 330 meters of the line under its responsibility, 7 kilometers and 390 meters of the side line, and 28 sets of turnouts. The quality has been greatly improved, with excellent accounting for 70 percent and good accounting for 30 percent. The area was officially approved as a backbone "Iron Ox" road maintenance area on September 5.

The Shenyang Locomotive Depot has maintained 150 days without accidents from March 21 to August 18 this year, safely traveling more than 1.21 million kilometers. On the eve of National Day, the section is bravely advancing towards the goal of 1.5 million kilometers. All the workers of the Zhengjiatun Engineering Section are also taking urgent action to resolutely complete the entire line once by the end of September according to the new road maintenance method, ensuring that the speed of trains in the area under their responsibility is generally improved, and a trial run will be carried out on September 27 and 28. Baichengzi Station has proposed not to waste a single cent of resources, not to waste a single minute of manpower, strive to exceed the loading task by 50 percent, and complete the transportation task for September ten days ahead of schedule. As of September 13, the Du Yingjiu signal group at the station had created a new record of 465 days of glorious accident-free operation. In order to greet National Day, the entire group has also proposed a plan to guarantee 500 days without accidents. As of early September, the freight department of the Changchun Station of the China Changchun Railway Bureau had exceeded 130 percent of the loading task and 49 percent of the unloading task; as of September 7, the transportation department had completed 150 days without accidents and is now striving towards the goal of 200 days without accidents. The entire staff of the Changchun Electrical Section of the bureau launched a production competition with high enthusiasm, unanimously proposing not to waste a drop of oil or an inch of wire, save expenses as much as possible, utilize waste products, and improve work efficiency. The telegraph office created a new record on September 3, breaking the bureau's standard of 50 minutes of detention per telegram, handling 390 telegrams a day, with an average detention time of only 20.2 minutes.

The staff of various units of the Tianjin Railway Administration are preparing their own gifts for National Day. The Beijing Inspection Depot, initiated by the Beijing-Shanghai chartered train group, launched a 1.5 million-car-kilometer accident-free competition, preparing to make a friendly challenge to the first and second trains of the Northeast Bureau. The Tianjin Railway Factory is striving to complete its annual task by the end of September. They have made full preparations for the car repair materials and are determined to complete this plan by improving labor organization and unleashing the potential forces in production. After nine and a half months of struggle and a relentless fight against accidents, the Fengtai Transportation Section completed 1 million kilometers of safe operation on September 10, creating a new record in the Tianjin Bureau. In a letter to Chairman Mao, the entire staff of the section made a solemn statement regarding the aggressive atrocities of American imperialism: "Now American imperialism is carrying out aggressive provocative wars, destroying peace. We unanimously oppose it. We resolutely guarantee to fully support the liberation of Taiwan and avenge the compatriots who died and were injured in the Northeast." The entire staff of the Fengtai Inspection Depot are welcoming the upcoming National Labor Model Representative Conference to be held in Beijing and the upcoming National Day with extremely excited hearts. Departments inside and outside the section have enthusiastically launched discussions, formulated plans, and proposed guarantee conditions, all expressing their intention to use practical actions as a gift. With close unity and mutual assistance, the entire staff of the repair shop have unleashed a high degree of labor enthusiasm. On September 12, the total number of inspection and repair work completed was equivalent to 81.1 Class C inspections, creating a new record for this month. The eleven inspection sub-stations along the Beijing-Shanhaiguan, Beijing-Hankou, Beijing-Mentougou, and Beijing-Suiyuan lines under the jurisdiction of the section jointly established a "Accident-Free Movement Week." The staff are unanimously striving to achieve the common goal of ensuring safe driving and guaranteeing no accidents, "safely escorting the national labor model hero representatives to Beijing." Under the call of the General Branch of the Communist Party of China in the Fengtai area, the staff of the section and their families also used their spare time to carry out a concentrated effort to remove grass and weeds along the lines, decorating the long railway lines very neatly and smoothly.

The production competition of railway workers to greet National Day is also in full swing on the Zhangjiakou, Qingdao, Zhengzhou, and Baotou-Tianshui railway lines.
