Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 7th: TASS, Moscow, September 6th: Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky received US Ambassador Mr. Kirk on September 6th and presented him with a note after reading it aloud. The full text of the note is as follows:

"The Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, based on reliable information, considers it necessary to inform the Government of the United States of America of the following: On September 4th, at 12:44 local time, a twin-engine aircraft of the Soviet Air Force, not carrying any bombing or torpedo weapons, was conducting a training flight from Port Arthur to the area within the boundary of the Port Arthur naval base, located in the Ocean Island area 140 kilometers off the coast of Korea, when it was attacked and fired upon without reason or cause by eleven fighter planes of the US Air Force. As a result of the attack, the Soviet aircraft was shot down and burned, crashing into the sea eight kilometers south of Ocean Island. The attack by US fighter planes on the Soviet Air Force aircraft was witnessed by two other Soviet aircraft accompanying the destroyed aircraft on the training flight, as well as by the Soviet observation and communications team on Ocean Island.

The representative of the United States in the United Nations Organization, unable to find any excuse to cover up this attack on the Soviet aircraft, put forward the false claim that the Soviet aircraft flew over escorting ships and flew towards the center of the United Nations aircraft formation with obvious hostility, and that it had even opened fire on US fighter planes.

In fact, the Soviet aircraft not only did not fly over the American ships, but did not even approach them; it was flying ten kilometers away from the ships, and as mentioned above, it was conducting a practice training flight and did not open fire on the US fighter planes, but was shot down due to the unprovoked attack by eleven US fighter planes.

The Soviet Government resolutely denies the US claims and strongly protests to the US Government against the criminal act committed by the US Air Force.

The Soviet Government believes that the US Government bears full responsibility for this self-humiliating crime committed by the US military authorities in blatant violation of recognized international law standards; and insists that the perpetrators of this attack be strictly investigated and punished, and that compensation be paid for the losses caused by the deaths of three pilots and the destruction of the Soviet aircraft.

The Soviet Government also considers it necessary to draw the attention of the US Government to the serious consequences that similar actions by the US military authorities may cause."

US Ambassador Kirk claimed that the US armed forces in the Pacific were subordinate to the United Nations and that this matter should be considered by the United Nations Organization rather than by the US Government. He refused to accept the note under this pretext.

Vyshinsky pointed out to Mr. Kirk that such a claim was completely unfounded, since the incident of September 4th had nothing to do with the military operations in Korea. Since the Soviet aircraft was shot down by US fighter planes, the responsibility for their actions should be borne entirely by the US military authorities acting under the jurisdiction of the US Government.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry delivered the aforementioned note to the US Embassy in Moscow on the same day.

　　美空军在海洋岛地区无端击落苏联飞机
    苏联向美国提出抗议
    要求严格惩罚肇事者并赔偿苏方损失提请注意类似行动可能造成严重后果
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：苏联外交部长维辛斯基于九月六日接见美国大使寇克先生，并将照会一件于宣读后递交寇克先生。照会全文如下：
    “苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府根据确实材料认为必须向美国政府宣布如下事项：在九月四日当地时间十二时四十四分，苏联空军的双发动机飞机一架，并未载有轰炸或施放鱼雷的武器装备，从旅顺口向旅顺口海军基地的境界以内、位于朝鲜海岸外一百四十公里的海洋岛地区作训练飞行，遭到美国空军的十一架战斗机的毫无理由、毫无原因的袭击与射击。袭击的结果，苏联飞机被击落焚毁，坠入海洋岛以南八公里的海中。美国战斗机对苏联空军飞机的袭击，为伴同该被毁飞机作训练飞行的其他两架苏联飞机以及海洋岛上的苏联观察与电讯队所目击。
    美国在联合国组织的代表，无法找到任何的借口，为了掩饰对于苏联飞机的这种袭击，就提出虚假的说法，说什么苏联飞机飞过护航的船只，并且怀有明显的敌意向联合国飞机队形中心飞去，并且据说还曾向美国战斗机开火。
    事实上，苏联的飞机不但没有飞过美国船只，甚至没有飞近该船，它是在离该船十公里以外的地方飞行，并且如上所述，是在作练习飞行训练，并没有向美国战斗机开火，但是却因为十一架美国战斗机的无端袭击而被击落。
    苏联政府断然否认美国的说法，并向美国政府坚决抗议美国空军所犯的罪行。
    苏联政府认为：美国政府对美国军事当局的这种以明目张胆地违犯公认的国际法标准的行为自贻羞辱的罪行，应负完全责任；并且坚持应严格调查与惩罚这次袭击的肇事者，并赔偿由三名驾驶员死难与苏联飞机被毁的损失。
    苏联政府并认为必须提请美国政府注意美国军事当局的类似行动所可能造成的严重后果。”
    美国大使寇克宣称美国在太平洋的武装部队隶属于联合国，这个问题据说必须由联合国组织而不是由美国政府考虑。他并且在这种借口之下拒绝接受照会。
    维辛斯基向寇克先生指出：这样的说法是完全没有根据的，因为九月四日的事件与在朝鲜的军事行动毫无关系。苏联飞机既被美国战斗机击落，那么他们的行动的责任就应该完全由在美国政府管辖之下行动的美国军事当局担负。
    苏联外交部于同日将上述照会送交美国驻莫斯科大使馆。
