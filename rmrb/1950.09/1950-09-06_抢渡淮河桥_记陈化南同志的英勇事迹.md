　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Bravely Seizing the Huai River Bridge
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　—An Account of Comrade Chen Huanan's Heroic Deeds
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Da Wu

　　On the night of July 24th, the dike of the Longzi River, more than ten li east of Bengbu city, was breached by wind and waves. The raging flood threatened the vast rural areas of Bengbu's eastern townships.

　　At just after 2:00 AM, the Bengbu City Flood Control Headquarters issued an urgent order for the waterborne flood control command to immediately mobilize fifty boats to rush to the city's east and rescue the disaster-stricken people. Comrade Chen Huanan of the Anhui North Huai River Navigation Administration was assigned the task of mobilizing ten boats to go to the city's east – a perilous mission that required passing through the Huai River Bridge in the rapid current.

　　He had been leading boats to transport dike-protecting sacks during the flood prevention and rescue efforts for three days and three nights without proper rest. His eyes were bloodshot, and his cheeks were sunken. Yet, he accepted this new task without hesitation.

　　Many civilian boats were moored in the Xin Chuantang (New Boat Pond). Upon hearing about crossing the bridge, the boatmen just stared blankly. They said, "It's dark, the wind is strong, the water is rapid, and our entire families are on these boats. What if something happens..." As soon as Comrade Chen heard this, he knew that this was not a problem that could be solved with a few words. Time was of the essence, so he targeted the smaller boats that didn't have families living on them, located behind the larger boats, as the focus of his mobilization efforts. However, the boatmen said, "The larger boats here can't do without these smaller boats, like a person without legs. It won't work if all the smaller boats leave." Comrade Chen thought, that's right! This point must be taken into consideration, so he discussed with everyone about leaving some smaller boats for the larger boats to use. As a result, sixteen smaller boats were immediately mobilized, each with two boatmen. Comrade Chen Huanan believed that there should be a great certainty of success in crossing the bridge, so he reduced the number to eleven based on the criteria of new boats and strong crew. Together with the boats from the Water Police Bureau and the Seamen's Union, there were a total of forty-six small boats that left Xin Chuantang. Comrade Chen Huanan sat in the last boat, urging the lagging boats to catch up.

　　Suddenly, the boats in front stopped one after another on the riverbank, with people clamoring in confusion, "What to do?" Comrade Chen Huanan rushed to the front and saw two dark masses of the Huai River Bridge (a pontoon bridge and a railway bridge) spanning the river like two black dragons, blocking the way. And the moonlight did not illuminate the situation below the bridge clearly, only the sound of the rushing river water squeezing through the bridge openings and hitting the bridge piers, creating a roaring noise.

　　He hurried ashore to learn about the situation. He found the Huai River Insurance Team and learned from them that the iron beams under the bridge were only a little over three feet above the water surface, and there were also many electric wires close to the water surface. The water on the west side of the bridge was more than two feet higher than on the east side, and the water below the bridge was rushing. Only one of the bridge openings of the two bridges was directly aligned, and the boats could only pass through that opening. However, there were many whirlpools between the two bridges, and if the boats weren't aligned correctly, they risked crashing into the iron bridge piers. The personnel of the Insurance Team also told him, "Since the flood, no one has dared to risk crossing the bridge, not even the Insurance Team dares to 'insure' it." But they knew that Comrade Chen Huanan had an urgent mission, so they agreed to help raise the electric wires.

　　Difficulties did not deter Comrade Chen Huanan. He was determined to complete this task. He went to the bridge east command post to ask for instructions. The comrade in charge of the command post, while commending his fearless spirit, told him to wait until dawn to cross in order to reduce the risk.

　　It was already past four o'clock when he returned from the bridge east command post. The eastern sky was beginning to lighten. He urged everyone to prepare to cross the bridge. But the boatmen, facing the rushing river, were all hesitant to move forward. So, he jumped onto a boat and said to an elderly boatman, "Uncle, let's use this boat to cross first, we'll set an example, and they'll dare to go. Uncle, we're going to save lives!" Seeing that the old boatman was still hesitating, he added, "Old Uncle! I'm only in my twenties, and you're already over fifty; I also have parents and a wife at home, and I don't have any relatives or friends over there, this is all for the people! Is there anything you can't bear to give up?" The old boatman was moved by his selfless spirit and said, "Comrade! If you're willing to give it your all, what can I be unwilling to give up!"

　　Dawn broke, and the small boat headed towards the bridge, leaping in the waves. The old boatman steered the scull at the stern, and Comrade Chen Huanan held a mop on the bow, preventing the boat from crashing into the bridge piers. More than a hundred eyes on the forty-five boats on the shore were staring at them, everyone's hearts were tightly clenched. The small boat sailed to the middle of the river, its bow pointing directly at the bridge opening that was directly aligned with the other bridge opening, and it plunged in as if flying. In a moment, it appeared between the two bridges, and then it passed through the second bridge and floated victoriously downstream on the river east of the bridge.

　　This was a powerful call to action, it boosted the courage of the people on the forty-five boats that remained west of the bridge. The forty-five small boats followed suit, one by one safely crossing the bridge. They opened up in rows to the bridge east command post, and then sailed towards the mouth of the Longzi River to take on the task of rescuing the disaster-stricken people.

　　抢渡淮河桥
    ——记陈化南同志的英勇事迹
    大武
    七月二十四日夜间，距离蚌埠市区东边十多里的龙子河河堤被风浪冲破了。滚滚洪水威胁着蚌市东乡的广大农村。
    蚌埠市防汛指挥部在深夜二点多钟，下了一道紧急命令，要水上防汛指挥所立即动员五十只船赶到市东抢救灾民。皖北淮河航务管理局的陈化南同志被分配去动员十只船到市东去——这是要在急流中穿过淮河桥的艰险任务。
    他在防汛抢险中带领船只抢运护堤麻袋，已经三天三夜没得到好好休息了，两只眼睛熬红了，腮肉也陷下去了。可是他仍然毫不犹豫地接受了这个新任务。
    新船塘里泊着不少的民船，一听说过大桥，船民们光瞪眼。他们说：“黑天半夜风大，水急，我们一只船上就是一家子，万一……”陈同志一听，知道这不是三言两语所能解决问题的。时间太急迫了，他就以大船后边不住家口的小船划子作为动员对象。可是船民们又说：“这里的大船离了脚划子，就像人少了腿，小划子都去了可不行。”陈同志一想，对！这一点是要照顾的，就跟大家商量留下一部分小划子让大船伙用。这样一来，十六只小划子马上被动员出来，每只船上还有两个船工。陈化南同志认为过桥应有很大把握才行，于是又按照船新人壮的条件，精减成十一只。连同水上公安局、海员工会的船只，共有四十六只小船，开出了新船塘。陈化南同志坐在最后的一只船上，督促着落在后面的船只赶上去。
    忽然前面的船一只只在河边停下来了，人声乱嘈嘈的嚷着：“怎么办？”陈化南同志赶到前面一看，黑幢幢的两道淮河桥（一道便桥，一道铁桥）像两条乌龙似的横跨在河面，挡住了去路。而月光又照不清桥下面的情况，只听到奔腾的河水挤过桥孔，撞着桥基，发出一片哗哗的喧噪声。
    他急忙到岸上去了解情况，找到了淮河保险队，从那里知道了桥底的铁梁离水面只有三尺多高，而且还有许多电线贴近水面。桥西边河水要比东边高二尺多，而桥下边的水在奔流着。两座桥的桥孔只有一只孔是直对的，船只有从那个孔里才能穿过去。可是两桥之间漩涡多得很，万一对不准，船就有在铁桥基上撞碎的危险。保险队的人员还告诉他说：“自从发大水以来，谁也不敢冒险过桥，就是保险队也不敢‘保险’”。但他们知道陈化南同志负着紧急任务，就答应帮助把电线叉起来。
    困难没有吓倒陈化南同志，他下决心要完成这个任务。他就到桥东指挥所去请示。指挥所的负责同志虽然嘉许他这种无畏的精神，但是为了减少危险性，告诉他等天明以后再过去。
    从桥东指挥所回来时，已经四点多钟了。东边天上透出了光亮。他就督促着大家准备开船过桥。但是船工们面对着湍急的河水，都畏缩不前。于是他跳上了一只船，并对一个年老的船工说：“老伯伯，我和你俩用这只船先过去，我们做个样儿，他们就敢过去了。老伯伯，去救人命呀！”他看到老船工还在犹疑着，就又说：“老伯！我今年才二十多岁，你已经五十多了；我家里也有父母妻子，那边我既没亲又没友，这全是为了老百姓呀！难道你还有什么舍不得？”老船工被他的忘我精神感动了，说：“同志！你舍得，我还有什么舍不得的！”
    天明了，小船向桥边开过去，在浪头中跳跃着。老船工在后梢掌着橹，陈化南同志拿了一只拖把站在船头上，防备着船撞上桥基。岸边四十五只船上一百多只眼睛盯着他们，各人的心都拉得紧紧的。小船开到了中流，船头直指向那个唯一正对着另一个桥洞的桥洞，像飞似的钻了进去，一忽儿在两桥之间出现，又钻过了第二道桥，在桥东的河面上胜利的向下飘流去了。
    这是一个有力的号召，它鼓起了留在桥西的四十五只船上的人们的勇气。四十五只小船照样子一只只的平安的过了桥，它们一排排的开到桥东指挥所，接着就航向龙子河口，去担负抢救灾民的工作去了。（转载上海解放日报）
