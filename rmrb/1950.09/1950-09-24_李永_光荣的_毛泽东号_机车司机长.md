Li Yong – Glorious Driver of the "Mao Zedong" Locomotive
	Xin Ji

	Railway operation emphasizes two things most: safety and efficiency. For a driver, ensuring the safety and efficiency of the train requires two conditions: meticulousness and caution in work, and proficiency in operating techniques.

	Li Yong, the driver of the national locomotive banner – the "Mao Zedong" – has become a model for railway workers nationwide, primarily due to his outstanding performance in these areas.

	In railway terms, this advantage is of paramount importance!

	Since Li Yong boarded the "Mao Zedong" locomotive on June 9, 1948, it has safely traveled 182,400 kilometers without a single accident for which he was responsible. However, he has prevented 13 accidents and has received 19 award banners. This achievement is inseparable from Li Yong's leadership and his excellent work style characterized by meticulousness, caution, and mastery of techniques.

	Meticulousness, caution, and absolute responsibility, repeatedly preventing major accidents

	Before he joined the "Mao Zedong" team, after the liberation of Harbin, his proactive responsibility and meticulous caution had already averted several accidents, particularly three potentially disastrous ones:

	On a pitch-black night, with no moon or lights, Li Yong was extremely tired after a day of intense work. He had just delivered a passenger train to Sankeshu and was returning to Harbin alone. The station gave the signal, and he started the engine. Despite his fatigue, he remained vigilant, bracing himself and focusing intently on the road ahead. Suddenly, he saw a large, dark mass obstructing the points. "Not good!" he thought and immediately applied the brakes. Upon inspection, he found that a locomotive had passed the stopping block and was only two meters away from a collision.

	On another occasion, he was in charge of Passenger Train No. 22 from Wangzhaotun to Harbin. This section was a curved, downhill track that intersected with the line from Guxiangtun to Majiagou. The earthen cliffs along the tracks were high, obscuring the view around the corner. As the train approached the junction, he knew he had to be extra cautious. He listened intently and, based on his experience, heard a "rumbling" sound. He determined that another locomotive was approaching and immediately sounded the danger whistle, slowing the train down. Sure enough, the other locomotive also sounded the danger whistle, and both trains stopped, averting another head-on collision.

	A third time, a track switch operator had set the track to a dead end. Thanks to his meticulousness and caution, he stopped the train in time. That day, he was pulling a single sleeping car, with the crew members still asleep inside!

	These successive near misses led to Li Yong being elected as a labor hero at the end of 1946.

	People affectionately call him Old Hero, and the leadership specifically appointed him as the driver of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive

	Li Yong is fifty years old this year, which is why people affectionately call him "Old Hero." He is from Yongji County, Jilin Province, in Northeast China. Because his family was poor, he worked as a hired farmhand. At the age of seventeen, he started working on the railway in Harbin. Through meticulousness, caution, diligence, and hard work, he became a driver at the age of thirty-seven. During the Japanese puppet regime, the heads of the locomotive depot were all Japanese. A wrong word would earn you a slap in the face, and a minor offense would get you an earful. If you tried to reason, the answer was big leather boots, rifle butts, and bayonets! He still gets upset when he recalls those times, saying, "I had to swallow my words and tears. Those thirty years were really hard!" It is precisely because he compared these hardships with the freedom, joy, and sense of ownership he felt after liberation that he has been so active and diligent these past three or four years. His status as a national model labor hero in the railway system today is not accidental.

	His title of "Special Grade Labor Hero" was awarded at last year's National Railway Locomotive Conference, at the same time that the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was selected as the national locomotive banner.

	The "Mao Zedong" was originally locomotive No. ㄇㄎ304 at the Harbin Locomotive Depot, which was repaired after liberation. The leadership specifically chose Li Yong to be the driver of the "Mao Zedong," and he has held that position for over three years. Working with another driver, Guo Shude, Li Yong led the "Mao Zedong" crew in implementing the package responsibility system, the new driving system, and the cyclical operation system. By setting plans within the group, regularly inspecting work, and engaging in criticism and self-criticism, work efficiency significantly improved. Coal and oil were saved, locomotives were carefully cleaned and repaired, and all crew members learned the B and C level inspections, inspiring other locomotives to do the same. From January 1947 to February 1949, the "Mao Zedong" safely traveled 139,218 kilometers, with a monthly average exceeding 6,000 kilometers, sometimes reaching 7,500 kilometers. The A-level inspection mileage was extended from the bureau's standard of 35,000 to over 54,600. When spearheading the implementation of the new driving system at the end of 1948, the "Mao Zedong" set a record of 41.8 kilometers per hour in technical speed. In January 1949, the mileage reached 10,047.6 kilometers. During the trial implementation of the cyclical operation system, it set a new record of 4,200 kilometers in nine days. On March 27, 1949, the "Mao Zedong" was transferred to the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau to promote the responsibility system, patiently sharing the experience of package responsibility, package inspection, and package repair with the entire Fengtai Locomotive Depot. As a result, the "May 1st Labor" and No. 1939 model locomotives emerged at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot. In November 1949, he went to Zhengzhou to promote the responsibility system. Initially, he encountered a lack of attention from the bureau's leadership and resistance from workers' conservative ideas. Through repeated efforts, running the train to demonstrate, holding technical training classes to explain the benefits of the responsibility system, and achieving real results and setting examples in setting plans, saving coal and oil, caring for locomotives, and conducting meetings for examination, he finally reversed the stalemate, broke through serious conservative and backward thinking, changed the irresponsible rotating crew system to the package crew system, helped the package crew establish various systems, eighty percent of the crew began to clean the train themselves, earnestly studied technology, learned to set plans, and learned to use large brakes, the fireman could handle daily and B and C level oil inspections, most locomotives implemented the three-shovel fire method, and responsible accidents were reduced by more than sixty-five percent.

	Visiting the Soviet Union and bringing back valuable construction experience

	After returning from the Soviet Union in October 1949 as one of the Chinese representatives to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Li Yong, the Old Hero, promoted the great achievements of Soviet construction everywhere, believing that the Soviet Union was the best example for the world. He often said that the "Mao Zedong" would travel all over China's railways. Wherever it went, he would introduce everything he saw in the Soviet Union, especially the various valuable experiences of Soviet railway construction, to all of China and every railway worker, so that the construction of the People's Railway in New China could achieve more rapid development and brilliant achievements.

	Summarizing Li Yong's work experience and leadership methods, according to him, there are three points: First, meticulousness, caution, and absolute responsibility. For example, when driving, not only should you carefully operate and take care of everything after departure, but you should also arrive early and leave late when handing over and taking over shifts, jointly organize the locomotive, carefully check it, and make clear explanations (complete handover and takeover). Responsible accidents after departure are often caused by insufficient inspection before departure or unclear handover. Second, you must strive to learn advanced railway technology from the Soviet Union, and you must tirelessly impart the technology and experience you have mastered to the younger generation. Third, comrades must unite, offer suggestions to each other, and come up with ideas and solutions together when encountering difficulties. You cannot do everything yourself, and you cannot cause trouble.

	"I will not give in to old age and will work harder to learn in the future!"

	If you ask him what his experience of striving for progress has been since liberation, he will immediately blush and say, "I have progressed too slowly, and I joined the Party too late! A person who is not a member of the Party is like a wild horse, running around according to its own nature without anyone to manage or educate it. If you are not careful, you will run off the wrong track. ... In the future, I will not give in to old age and will work harder to learn!" (Attached picture)

　　李永——光荣的“毛泽东号”机车司机长
    辛辑
    铁路行车最讲求两点：安全和效率。以司机来说，要保证开车的安全和效率，必须具备两个条件，就是工作细心谨慎和操纵技术熟练。
    全国机车旗帜——“毛泽东号”的司机长李永，所以成为全国铁路工人的模范，首先在这方面表现得非常突出。
    在铁路说来，这个优点是有头等重要的意义的！
    “毛泽东号”机车，从一九四八年六月九日李永上车起一直到现在，已经安全走行了十八万二千四百公里，没有出过一次责任事故，却防止了事故十三件，并先后得了十九面奖旗。这个成绩，是和李永的领导，和李永的掌握技术细心谨慎的优良作风分不开的。
  细心谨慎，绝对负责，屡次防止了恶性事故
    在哈尔滨解放后，他还没有到“毛泽东号”以前，就由于他的积极负责，细心谨慎，避免了不少事故，特别是机警地避免了三次恶性事故：
    在一个漆黑的夜里，没有月亮也没有灯光，李永由于一天紧张的工作，人已极其疲乏了。这时，他送客车到三棵树入了库，单机回哈尔滨。站上给了信号，他开车了，但是越疲乏他越警惕，振作精神，极力注视着前方。他突然发现前面黑虎虎一大片，压着道岔子。“不好！”他捉摸着立刻撂了闸。下车一看，原来一台机车过了停车挡，只差两米没撞上去。
    再一次，他乘务二十二次旅客列车，从王兆屯到哈尔滨。这一段是弯形道，下坡，又和另外一条从顾乡屯到马家沟的线路成十字形。道旁土崖很高，看不见前面的拐角。车到十字岔附近的时候，他知道更要注意了，他聚精会神的倾听着，凭着经验，他听到一种“轰轰”的声音，他断定对面有机车过来了，立刻拉响危险笛，同时让车徐行。果然对面那台机车也拉响危险笛，双方都停下了，又避免了一次正面冲突的恶性事故。
    第三次是搬道的把道搬到死岔上去了，由于他的细心谨慎，及早停车，没有开过去。那天是单机挂着一辆宿营车，车里的乘务员们还正睡觉呢！
    这样接二连三的避免恶性事故，一九四六年年底李永就当选了劳动英雄。
  人们亲切地称呼他为老英雄，领导上特意让他担任“毛泽东号”
        司机长
    李永今年五十岁了，所以人们都亲切地称呼他为“老英雄”。他是东北吉林省永吉县人。因为家里穷，当过雇农。十七岁上就到哈尔滨铁路上做工，细心谨慎，勤学苦练，熬到三十七岁才当了司机。伪满时期他跑车，机务段的头子都是日本人，一句话不对就挨嘴巴，一件事不顺眼就吃耳光子。如果想讲理，大皮靴、枪托、刺刀就是理！他一提起过去这些，至今还是难受地说：“有话蹩在心里，有眼泪咽到肚里，那三十年的日子真不容易过呀！”正因为把这些苦难和解放以后的自由、愉快，当主人的生活一对比，这三四年来他是份外的积极和努力，他今天所以成为全国铁道系统的特等劳动英雄，不是偶然的。
    他的“特等劳动英雄”，是在去年全国铁路机务会议上，和“毛泽东号”被选为全国机车旗帜的同时当选的。
    “毛泽东号”原是哈尔滨机务段的一台，ㄇㄎ三○四号机车，在解放以后修复起来的。领导上特意挑选了李永担任“毛泽东号”的司机长，至今已三年多。李永和另一司机郭树德合作下，领导“毛泽东号”乘务组实行包乘负责制，新行车制，循环运转制，在小组内订计划，按时检查工作，展开批评与自我批评，工作效率就显著地提高了。省煤省油，机车认真擦洗检修，全组人员都学会了乙丙检，并带动其他机车也这样作。从一九四七年一月至一九四九年二月，“毛泽东号”共安全走行了十三万九千二百一十八公里，每月走行平均超过六千公里，有时达到七千五百公里。甲检公里比局定标准三万五延长到五万四千六百多。一九四八年底带头推行新行车制时，“毛泽东号”创造了技术速度四十一点八公里的纪录。一九四九年一月份，走行公里竟达到一万零四十七点六。在试行循环运转制当中，又创造了九天走行四千二百公里的新纪录。一九四九年三月二十七日，“毛泽东号”调到天津路局丰台机务段推行负责制，把包乘包检包修的经验，耐心传授给丰台全机务段。因此，丰台机务段出现了“五一劳动号”及一九三九号典型机车。一九四九年十一月，又去郑州推行负责制，一开始遇到路局领导上的不重视与工友保守思想的抵抗，几经努力，跑车给他们看，开技术轮训班讲负责制的好处给大家听，同时在定计划、省煤省油、爱护机车、开会检讨等方面做出真正的成绩与榜样来，终于扭转了僵局，打破了严重的保守落后思想，改变了无人负责的轮乘制为包乘制，帮助包乘组建立了各种制度，乘务员百分之八十动手自己擦车，认真学习技术，学订计划，并学会了使用大闸，司炉能担任日常及乙丙检给油，大部分机车实行了三锹焚火法，责任事故减少到百分之六十五以上。
  到苏联去参观，带回来宝贵的建设经验
    李永老英雄在一九四九年十月，作为中国代表之一参加苏联伟大的社会主义革命三十二周年纪念归国后，到处宣传苏联建设的伟大成就，认为苏联是全世界最好的榜样。他常说，“毛泽东号”将走遍全中国的铁路，不论到那里，他要把在苏联见到的一切，特别是苏联铁路建设的各种宝贵经验介绍给全中国，介绍给每一个铁路员工，使新中国人民铁路的建设获得更迅速的发展与辉煌的成就。
    总结李永的工作经验与领导方法，据他自己说有如下三点：一、细心谨慎，绝对负责。比如开车，不仅发车后要认真操纵全面照顾，在交班接班时也要早到晚走，共同整理机车，仔细检点，交代清楚（交清接清）。发车后发生责任事故，常常是由于发车前检点不够，或交接班交代不清所致；二、要努力向苏联学习先进的铁路技术，要把自己已经掌握的技术和经验不厌麻烦的传授给年青的一代；三、同志们要团结，有意见互相提，遇到困难大家出主意想办法，不能一人包办，不能闹蹩扭。
  “今后我不服老，还要更加努力的学习！”
    你如果再问他解放以来对力求进步的体会怎么样？他马上会脸红红地对你说：“我进步得太慢，入党太晚！一个人不入党，就好比一匹野马，任着性子乱跑没人管教，一不小心就跑到斜岔上去了。………今后我不服老，还要更加努力的学习！”（附图片）
