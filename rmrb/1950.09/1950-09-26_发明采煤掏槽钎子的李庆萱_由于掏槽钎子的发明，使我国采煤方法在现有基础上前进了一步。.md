　　Li Qingxuan, Inventor of the Coal Mining Slotting Drill
    Due to the invention of the slotting drill, China's coal mining methods have taken a step forward on the existing basis.
    Lin Li
    At the end of 1949, a new type of coal mining tool called the "thermos-style" slotting drill appeared in the Hegang Coal Mine, located in the northeasternmost corner of China. The emergence of this tool advanced the long-stagnant coal mining tools, increasing the efficiency of coal blasting with explosives by nearly double. The Hegang Mine expanded its use to retreat mining, with each blast yielding five and a half tons of coal, an increase of 1.75 times compared to the previous two tons, setting a new record for mining efficiency in Hegang. After the news spread, mines in Northeast China, North China, and even East China sent personnel to visit and learn. The Northeast People's Government issued a commendation notice, awarding a first-class Red Flag Medal and a reward of 10 million yuan (Northeast currency). This pioneer, who directly delved into the mine shafts and worked with the workers to improve coal mining tools, was Comrade Li Qingxuan.

    Putting down the "airs" of a technician to live and work with the miners

    Li Qingxuan was an ordinary technician, and one who had just transferred from electromechanical engineering to underground coal mining. He had not attended a specialized school; his success was built on starting from reality, solving practical problems, and combining personal skills with the masses.

    He said that what inspired him to reform coal mining tools was mainly the workers' enthusiastic labor. At that time, the Hegang miners, like all workers in Northeast China, launched a vigorous movement to create new records. As a technician, Li Qingxuan was sent to the No. 11 pit of the Nanshan Mine to help with the work. He put down the "airs" of a technician, went to the working faces in the mine pit, and worked with the workers. He saw that the coal miners were all sweating profusely, and the loaders were extremely exhausted. Everyone was putting in all their strength, but the output only increased by one-third. He was both moved by the workers' enthusiasm and aware of the importance of his own responsibility. He came to the conclusion that relying solely on increasing labor intensity could not create higher records. So he resolved to find a way out by improving technology.

    However, he carefully observed every step of coal mining and loading, and could not find a place to reform.

    Studying the experience of predecessors to find a way to improve

    It was at a meeting to mobilize the new record creation movement that he heard someone say: When the No. 12 pit of the Nanshan Mine used explosives to blast coal, there was one time when the first blast didn't go well. After a second charge, more coal was blasted down than usual. Based on this story, he investigated the coal mining process of "drilling and blasting" at that time. First, slots were dug, and then four holes were drilled simultaneously on the coal face, one and a half meters apart, digging one meter deep. The ends of the holes were fifteen sheng apart, each loaded with two packets of explosives, and the outside was sealed with mud to make them explode simultaneously. This would blast down the coal between the four holes, about one and a half tons, which is commonly called "piercing the heart." After repeated study, Li Qingxuan realized that this method would disperse the explosive force and could not exert its due explosive power. He then studied the blasting area and found that the mud seals of the four holes occupied one-sixth of the area. The resistance of the mud seals was much smaller than that of the coal blocks clamped by stones. And if the mud seals were not properly sealed, they could not be blasted. He thought the other way around: if the explosives could be concentrated together, the explosive force would be increased. Reducing the area occupied by mud seals could strengthen the external resistance and relatively enhance the explosive force. He was sure that the previous story was due to the concentration and increase of explosives.

    But how to concentrate the explosives and give full play to their power?

    At first, he simply thought of loading more explosives and filling more mud seals. He tried to increase the original two packets of explosives per hole to four or five packets. However, this would become a long explosive strip, which would not only fail to concentrate the explosives, but also involve the installation position of the detonating cap. This obviously could not solve the problem. He thought of simply changing to a larger drill to make the blast holes thicker and larger. This could add more explosives and solve the difficulty of detonating them together. However, the mud seals would increase accordingly, the external resistance would be smaller, and the power of the blast would still be blasted outward. Therefore, this would not work either. Finally, he studied the principle of blasting and the blasting range of explosives, but still could not find a solution. He went to consult engineers. The two engineers suggested two methods, but neither was suitable for the current needs. However, from the engineers' conversation, he received great inspiration. He affirmed that if he wanted to strengthen the explosive force, he could only make the blast holes thinner and enlarge the end, and the most ideal way was to dig a hammer-shaped powder cavity.

    However, how to realize his ideal plan? There was still no way. In order to find this way, he sat alone in his room thinking, lay in bed thinking, and walked around thinking, but the more he thought, the more depressed he became.

    A strange Soviet key solved his doubts

    One morning, Li Qingxuan went to the office to work. Because he arrived too early, the door was still locked. He found the key and saw that it was a straight stick, and he didn't know how to use it. Looking at the lock again, it looked very novel, made in the Soviet Union, with only a round eye at the opening. How could this be opened? Upon further inspection, he found that the front end of the key was a living head that could be split into two strands, with an upper and lower shaft embedded with a movable copper piece. When the copper piece was against something, it would turn its head and extend into the lock, and it could be straight or bent freely. He suddenly felt that this was the slotting drill he wanted. Excited, he didn't even open the door or eat breakfast, and rushed back to the Nanshan Mine.

    He wanted to make a slotting drill that could turn corners. He reported the plan to the Director of the Mining Bureau, and immediately received the Director's encouragement. He explained to the engineers the principle that the slotting drill could be made in imitation of the Soviet key, and the engineers believed that it would be successful. He introduced the production plan to the workers and received the support of the majority of workers. With encouragement, sponsorship, and support from all parties, Li Qingxuan explained the research process, purpose, and manufacturing method to ironworker Li Shiying. Li Shiying understood that this was a great success in the new record movement, so he immediately started working on it.

    Workers start making drills, and mining engineers come together to study

    The corner drill was soon made by worker Li Shiying. During the testing period, mining engineers Tian Yuxue and Du Diankui also participated. The initial test confirmed that the drill could turn corners. The first time they loaded eight packets of sticky explosives, and the coal that was blasted down was very good. But there was too much powdered coal. After research, mining engineers Tian and Du believed that they should drill deeper and load less explosives in the future. According to the opinions of the two mining engineers, it was considered appropriate to load five packets of explosives. At the same time, it was discovered that there was a danger of coal dust explosion. After research by mining engineer Tian, it was decided that after the slot was dug and the explosives were loaded, two rock powder (lime powder) bags should be installed outside the mud seals. When the explosives exploded, the rock powder could be mixed into the coal dust to avoid the danger of coal dust explosion. After all technical problems were solved, the pit leader of the No. 11 pit proposed to test it in a working face with hard coal, so that it could be widely promoted. The test results were equally good. In the revelry after the successful test, they carefully observed the effectiveness of the new drill. They found that the dug powder cavity was very similar to a pot shape, and the blast hole was like a pot handle. Mining engineer Tian Yuxue proposed to name it: "Thermos-style slotting drill." This was immediately approved by Li Qingxuan and all personnel. So far, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government and the Northeast Coal Mining Administration issued a commendation notice. An appropriate evaluation was made on the new tool, and it was required to be promoted in all coal mines in Northeast China. The notice stated:

    The thermos-style slotting drill creates a new record for mining efficiency

    "...This is a major achievement in coal mining technology. It not only improves tunneling efficiency, but also reduces production costs, saving the country a huge amount of wealth. As efficiency improves, productivity also increases. For example, if we calculate the tunneling task of 48,000 meters for the mine in 1950, a total of seventy-one working faces are producing. In the past, each working face only advanced an average of three meters per day, which would take nine months to complete. With the new method of drilling holes, blasting twice per shift, each working face can advance at least seven meters per day, which can be completed in only four months. This is a major gain in the new record movement...."

    The thermos-style slotting drill manufactured by Li Qingxuan has now spread to North China and East China, and will be promoted to Southwest China and Central South China. His success has attracted the attention of coal mines across the country. Beijing Film Company also ran from thousands of miles away to specially film Li Qingxuan and the coal mining method using his invented slotting drill. But he believes that what is more important is to find the path of combining technology with workers. Therefore, when Hegang implemented mechanized coal mining in May of this year, Li Qingxuan was sent to the No. 120 working face of the Dongshan Mine to conduct key tests. After going there, he naturally handed over the mechanization plan to the workers for discussion, but at that time, many technicians believed that there was no need to discuss it with the workers. They said that the workers did not understand machinery and could not discuss anything. But Li Qingxuan personally participated, discussed with the workers, and studied together. Whenever he had time, he explained the charts and technical operations of mechanization to the workers. The workers felt that the current technicians were one of their own, and the technicians also felt that the work was easier to do. The coal production of the No. 120 working face quickly rose to three times higher than before, reaching a new record of 400 tons of coal per day, making a good start for the implementation of mechanization in the entire Hegang Mine.

    Promote mechanized coal mining to create new coal production records

    The success of the pilot implementation of mechanized coal mining enabled Li Qingxuan to gloriously join the Communist Party. At the same time, his connection with the masses became closer. Therefore, when he was about to leave the No. 120 working face and return to the Mining Bureau to work, both Li Qingxuan and the workers expressed their reluctance. At that time, the workers proposed to launch a new record in memory of Comrade Li Qingxuan's help. Under this slogan, the output of the No. 120 working face jumped again to 675 tons. At the same time, the workers presented Li Qingxuan with a pennant embroidered with: "Learn from the pioneers of economic construction – Bolshevik technicians." At that time, Comrade Li Qingxuan tightly held the workers' hands and shed tears of gratitude.

    In fact, Li Qingxuan's reputation and influence are not only among the workers, but even the workers' families and children also give him a thumbs up to show their respect. The elementary school students of the staff and workers' children school wrote in their composition books: "I want to be like Li Qingxuan in the future." "Li Qingxuan, who is not afraid of difficulties and invents and creates, is the hero in my mind." Due to his profound influence among the masses, he was elected as a member of the Management Committee of the Mining Bureau, a representative of the Hegang Municipal People's Congress, a member of the Songjiang Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, and a member of the Preparatory Committee of the National Coal Miners' Union.

    Before coming to the capital for the meeting, Li Qingxuan had just finished writing a simple explanation of the technical knowledge of the combine coal mining machine. This is another achievement in order to enable workers to master modern tools. With it, workers can quickly learn technical operations, so the Hegang Mine can boldly propose to start a key test of the combine coal mining machine on National Day. Li Qingxuan plans to concentrate on promoting combine coal mining after the Congress of Labor Models of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers. He also predicts that with the past experience of combining technology and the masses, the promotion of combine coal mining will be successful. (with picture)

　　发明采煤掏槽钎子的李庆萱
    由于掏槽钎子的发明，使我国采煤方法在现有基础上前进了一步。
    林里
    一九四九年底，在我国最东北角的鹤岗煤矿上，出现了一种新式采煤工具，叫做药壶式掏槽钎子。这个工具的出现，把多年停滞不前的采煤工具推进了一步，使用火药崩的煤效率提高近一倍。鹤岗矿把它扩展到回采上，每炮下煤五吨半，比以前的二吨提高了一点七五倍。开创鹤岗采掘效率的新纪录。消息传出后，东北、华北、乃至华东各矿，先后派员前往参观学习。东北人民政府发出奖励通告，给予一等红旗奖章、并一千万元（东北币）奖金。这位直接深入矿井，和工人一起改进采煤工具的首创者，就是李庆萱同志。
    放下技术人员的“架子”到矿内和工人工作生活在一起
    李庆萱是个普通技术员，而且是刚由机电工程转到坑下采煤的。他没有进过专门学校，他的成功，是建筑在从实际出发，解决现实问题，把个人技术与群众结合在一起的方法上。
    他说启发他决心改革采煤工具的，主要是工人们的热情劳动。那时，鹤岗矿工和全东北的工人一样，展开了轰轰烈烈的创造新纪录运动。做为技术人员的李庆萱，被派往南山矿十一坑帮助工作。他放下技术人员的“架子”，到矿坑内的掌子里和工人一起工作。他看见刨煤工人个个汗流浃背，装车工人疲惫异常，每个人都拿出了全身力气，而产量仅只提高了三分之一。他一方面为工人的劳动热情所激动，一方面想到自己责任的重大。并从而得出结论说：单靠提高劳动强度，是不能创造更高的纪录的。于是他下决心从改进技术上找出路。
    然而，他仔细观察了刨煤、装车的各个环节，找不出可以改革的地方。
    钻研前人经验找到改进门路
    那是在动员创新纪录运动的一次会议上，他听人说：南山矿十二坑用火药崩煤的时候，有一次第一炮没有响好，二次装药后，崩下的煤比往常特别多。根据这一传说，他考察当时“打眼放炮”的采煤过程，先掏槽，而且要在各距一米半的煤面上，同时锥上四个眼，掏进一米深。眼的终点相距十五生的，各装火药两包，外部用泥塞堵死，使其同时爆炸。这就可以把四个眼之间的、大约一吨半的煤崩下，俗语叫做“锥心炮”。李庆萱反复研究以后，发觉这一办法会使药力分散，不能发挥其应有的爆破力。他再研究爆破面积，发觉四个眼道的泥塞就占了六分之一。泥塞的抵抗力与用石头夹着的煤块相比是很小的。而且泥塞堵不好就炸不了。他反过来想：如果能把火药集中于一起，爆破力就会加大。减少泥塞所占面积，就可加强外部的抵抗力，相对增强爆破力。前面的传说，他肯定就是由于火药集中与加多了的缘故。
    可是，怎样集中火药，并充分发挥其威力呢？
    开始他简单的想到多装火药，多填泥塞。他企图把原来每眼装两包药增至四五包。然而这会成为长药条，不但不能集中，而且牵联到引爆雷管的按装位置。这显然不能解决问题。他想干脆换个大钎子，把炮眼打粗粗的、大大的。可以加多火药并解决一同引爆的疑难。然而泥塞随之加大，外部抵抗力更小，炮的力量依然向外爆射。因此这也行不通。最后他研究了爆破原理，以及火药的爆破范围，还是找不到解决的办法。他去请教工程师，两个工程师说了两种办法，但都不适合于目前的需要。然而从工程师的谈话里，他却得到很大的启示。他肯定：要想加强爆破力，就只有把炮眼变细，终点加大，最理想的是掏成一个鎯头形的药窠。
    然而，怎样实现他所理想的计划呢？还是没有办法。为了找到这条道路，他独自坐在屋子里想，躺在床上想，走起路来也在想，然而越想越苦闷。
    奇怪的苏联钥匙解决了他的疑难
    一天早晨，李庆萱到办公室上班。因来得太早，门还锁着。他找到钥匙一看，是一根直棍，不知如何使用。再看看锁，样子非常新奇，是苏联制造，开管处只有一个圆眼。这怎末开呢？进一步检查，他发觉钥匙的前端是一个活头，可以分做两股叉开，上下一根轴，嵌着一个活动的铜片。铜片顶着东西的时候，就弯回头来，伸到锁子里面，可以自由直、弯。他突然感觉到这就是他所想的掏槽钎子。他兴奋的门也不开，饭也不吃，一股劲跑回南山矿去了。
    他要制造一种能拐弯的掏槽钎子。把计划报告给矿务局长，立即得到局长的鼓励；他把掏槽钎子可以仿照苏联钥匙制作法的道理讲给工程师，工程师认为一定成功。他把制做计划介绍给工人们，得到广大工人的拥护。在各方面鼓励、赞助与拥护下，李庆萱把研究过程、目的与制作法讲给铁工李士英，李士英懂得这是新纪录运动中的大成功，于是立即动手干起来。
    工人动手制钎子、矿师一齐来研究
    拐弯钎子不久就由工人李士英制成了。试验期间田欲学、杜殿魁两位矿师亦参加了。初次试验肯定了钎子能够拐弯。第一次装了八包粘药，爆炸后崩下的煤很好。但粉煤太多。田、杜矿师研究后，认为以后应该深打眼，少装药。遵照两位矿师的意见认为以装五包药为宜。同时发现有煤尘爆发的危险，经过田矿师的研究，决定在掏槽装药后，把泥塞的外边装上两个岩粉（石灰末）袋，火药爆发的同时，岩粉即可混入煤尘中间，就可避免煤尘爆发的危险。在一切技术问题解决之后，十一坑坑长提议到煤质硬的掌子去试验，以便普遍推广。试验结果同样良好。在试验成功后的狂欢中，他们仔细观察新式钎子的效能。发现掏成的药窠很像壶形，炮眼犹如壶把。田欲学矿师提议命名为：“药壶式掏槽钎子”。立即博得李庆萱及全体人员的赞同。至此，东北人民政府工业部及东北煤矿管理局发出奖励通告。对新式工具做了适当评价，要在全东北煤矿上推广。通告中说：
    药壶式的掏槽钎子创采掘效率新纪录
    “……这是目前煤矿采掘技术上的重大成就。不但使掘进效率提高，而且降低了生产成本，给国家节省了巨大财富。由于效率提高，生产力也随之提高。如以该矿一九五○年掘进任务四八、○○○米来算，共七十一个掌子生产，过去每个掌子每天平均只前进三米，要九个月才能完成，以新的方法打眼，每班放两次炮，每个掌子每天至少能前进七米，只要四个月就可完成任务。这是新纪录运动在目前的重大收获。……”
    李庆萱制造的药壶式掏槽钎子现已传播到华北与华东，并将推广到西南与中南。他的成功，引起全国各煤矿的注意。北京电影公司还从数千里外跑去，专为李庆萱及其发明的掏槽钎子采煤法拍制了影片。但他认为更重要的是找到了技术与工人相结合的道路。因而今年五月鹤岗实行机械化采煤时，李庆萱被派东山矿一二○掌子做重点试验。去后他就很自然的把机械化计划交给工人讨论，但当时不少技术人员认为没有和工人商量的必要。说工人不懂机械，商量不出什么名堂。但李庆萱亲自动手，和工人一起讨论，一起学习。一有时间就向工人讲解机械化的图表制。和技术操作等问题。工人们感到现在的技术人员和自己是一家了，技术人员也感到工作好做了。一二○掌子的产煤量，很快上升到高于以往三倍的数目，达到日产四百吨煤的新纪录，为鹤岗全矿实行机械化作了良好的开端。
    推广机械化采煤再创产煤新纪录
    试行机械化采煤的成功，使李庆萱光荣的参加了共产党。同时他和群众的联系也更密切了。所以当他要离开一二○掌子，回矿务局工作的时候，李庆萱和工人都表示恋恋不舍。当时工人提出要为纪念李庆萱同志的帮助而开展新纪录。在这一口号下，一二○掌子的产量又一跃而为六百七十五吨。工人们同时献给李庆萱一面锦旗，上面绣着：“向经济建设的先锋——布尔塞维克技术者看齐。”李庆萱同志当时紧握着工人的手，流出了感激的热泪。
    其实李庆萱的声誉和影响还不仅仅是在工人中，连工人的家属和子弟，一提到李庆萱也是翘起大拇指表示对他的崇敬，职工子弟学校的小学生，在作文簿上写着：“我将来要像李庆萱一样”。“不怕困难，发明创造的李庆萱，是我心目中的英雄。”由于他在群众中的深刻影响，他被选为矿务局管理委员会的委员，鹤岗市人民代表会的代表，松江省人民协商会的委员，以及全国煤矿工会筹委会的委员等。
    在来首都开会之前，李庆萱刚刚写完康拜因联合采煤机的技术知识浅解。这是为了使工人们能够掌握近代化工具的又一功绩。有了它，工人们可以很快学会技术操作，因而鹤岗矿才能大胆提出于国庆日开始重点试验联合采煤机。李庆萱计划在工农兵劳模代表大会以后，集中精力推行联合采煤机采煤。他并预言：有了过去技术和群众结合的经验，联合采煤机的推行一定会获得成功。（附图片）
