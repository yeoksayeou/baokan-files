Zhengzhou Railway Hospital Letter
Accepting Criticism, Acknowledging Mistakes

To the Editorial Comrades:

After the publication of Comrade Guo Juyi's letter criticizing the Zhengzhou Railway Hospital Director in the "People's Garden" on August 19th, we immediately convened relevant personnel for inspection and self-examination. We believe that Comrade Guo's criticism is well-intentioned, and we sincerely accept it. We now inform you of our self-examination.

On August 1st, Comrade Guo Juyi escorted Comrade Dong Fulin, a soldier with a leg injury, to our hospital for treatment. Based on the patient's condition, we immediately arranged for him to register early. The doctor at the time considered Dong's injury to be serious and approved his hospitalization, preparing to perform surgery. When completing the admission procedures, our staff member told Comrade Guo: "If soldiers and commanders of the Railway Corps are injured or sick, they must have a certificate from a leader above the regimental level and pay fees according to regulations." Comrade Guo then said: "We did not bring any money and need to go back to the unit to get it." The staff member went to ask the director for instructions, and the director insisted on complying with the aforementioned system. Comrade Guo said: "Our unit is just a company, can't you make an exception?" The director said: "Of course, we can make an exception, but the hospitalization fee must be paid; even with a regimental-level letter of introduction, payment must be made in cash." At that time, Comrade Guo Juyi was very dissatisfied and immediately stated: "We will take him to the Shijiazhuang Hospital for treatment, please change the dressing for the injured person first." We then carried the patient back to the outpatient dressing room and asked the director of surgery to jointly examine and carefully change the dressing for the injured person. The injured person was then carried to the station to wait for the train.

This incident shows that our staff did not recognize in their thinking that when a patient is admitted to the hospital, they should first try to relieve or reduce the patient's pain. Completing the admission procedures is a secondary issue and can be made flexible. From now on, all of our staff must correct this mistake.

This time, we did not provide timely treatment for Comrade Dong Fulin and therefore delayed him by half an hour, increasing his pain, for which we should be responsible.

Comrade Guo Juyi's criticism is of great help to our work. We guarantee that in the future, we will earnestly serve the people to answer the comrades' concern and expectations for us.

### 郑州铁路医院来信  接受批评承认错误

　　郑州铁路医院来信
    接受批评承认错误编辑同志：
    八月十九日“人民园地”发表了国举义同志批评郑州铁路医院院长的信后，我们即召集有关人员作了检查与检讨。我们认为国同志的批评是善意的，我们诚恳地接受。现将我们的检讨告诉你们。
    八月一日，国举义同志护送腿部受伤的战士董福林同志来院医疗。我们根据伤员病状，马上给他提前挂号。当时医师认为董的伤势严重，已准他住院，并准备施行手术治疗。办理入院手续时，我们的工作同志对国同志说：“铁道兵团的指战员如有伤病，须经团级以上首长证明并照章纳费。”国举义同志就说：“我们没有带钱，要回到部队去取。”工作同志便去请示院长，院长坚持必须遵守上述制度。国同志就说：“我们的单位只是连部，难道就不能通融吗？”院长说：“当然可以通融，但是住院费是要照缴的；平时即使有团级的介绍信，也要付现款。”当时国举义同志很不满意，随即声明：“我们到石家庄医院去给他治疗吧，请你们先给伤者换药好了。”我们即将病人再抬到门诊部换药室，并请外科主任会同检查，仔细为伤者换药包扎后，伤员即被抬往车站候车。
    这件事情说明了我们工作人员在思想上没有认识到当病人入院时，应首先设法为病人解除或减轻痛苦，办理入院手续是次要问题，可以通融的。今后，我们全体人员必需纠正这个错误。
    这次我们没有及时为董福林同志进行治疗，并因此拖延了半小时的时间，增加了他的痛苦，这是我们应该负责的。
    国举义同志的批评，对我们的工作是有很大帮助的，我们保证在今后要切切实实地做到为人民服务，以回答同志们对我们的关心和期望。
    郑州铁路医院
