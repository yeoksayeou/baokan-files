　　Large-Scale Rectification Begins in the Central South Region
    Main Methods are Holding Rectification Meetings and Organizing Rotating Training Classes
    Central Content is Reviewing Work and Preparing to Implement Land Reform
    [News from this newspaper] Our special reporter Xiong Fu reports: The rectification movement of Communist Party member cadres in the Central South Region has now begun on a large scale. Initial indications show that various localities have generally grasped the correct spirit of rectification, thus achieving good results. However, leading cadres in some regions do not fully understand the spirit of rectification and have taken some detours.
    This rectification is being carried out under the conditions of national victory and busy work; at the same time, the Central South Region lacks a formal party school system, and although in-service cadre study has been successful, the institutions are not yet sound. Therefore, the main methods of rectification in the Central South Region are holding rectification meetings (in the form of party representative conferences) and organizing rotating training classes. The common steps in each province are from top to bottom, starting with the provincial party committee convening a party representative meeting of county party secretaries and above, then the prefectural party committee convening a party representative meeting of district party secretaries and above, while the county party committee organizes rotating training classes for general party member cadres in districts and townships.
    The party representative meeting convened by the Henan Provincial Party Committee concluded on July 26. The party representative meetings convened by the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee began on August 1 and are currently underway. Prior to this, a small number of prefectural party committees in Hubei and Jiangxi convened rectification meetings or organized rotating training classes. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee also convened an enlarged meeting of the provincial party committee in July to review the leadership work of the provincial party committee. The Hunan Provincial Party Committee originally planned to convene a party representative meeting on August 1, but decided to postpone it in order to concentrate all efforts on leading disaster relief. The Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, due to inconvenient transportation, only convened a joint meeting of prefectural party committee secretaries in July. Guangdong, under the direct leadership of the South China Sub-bureau, is conducting rectification with the prefectural party committee as the unit, and the various prefectural party committees have started successively in June and July. It is estimated that most of the Central South Region can promote the rectification movement to the general party member cadres at the county and district levels in September.
    The Central South Region will implement land reform in areas with a population of 50 million this winter and next spring, and this rectification is a major step in preparing for land reform. The main content of the rectification meetings and rotating training classes, in terms of rural work, is to study and review the policies and work style for implementing rent reduction and preparing for land reform. The general method of the rectification meetings is to first convey the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, then have leading comrades at all levels present work summary reports on work tasks and tendencies within the party, followed by the study of rectification documents, combined with policy thinking and work style, to conduct criticism and self-criticism among cadres.
    The rectification meetings in various localities generally start from reviewing work and analyzing the situation in accordance with the spirit of the documents, correctly assessing the achievements of leading the masses since liberation, and also exposing serious shortcomings and errors in past work.
            More clearly recognize the domestic situation, must unite internally to defeat the enemy
    The general gains of the rectification meetings in various localities are, first, a clearer understanding of the domestic situation after the victory of the revolution. The complacency caused by the national victory and the achievements of work in one place or at one time in the past has been criticized. Everyone has a clearer understanding of the strength of the people's democratic forces, strengthening and firming up confidence in victory; on the other hand, they also recognize the need for a full estimate of the current difficulties, and the need to be vigilant against the sabotage activities of the imperialist organizations and the Kuomintang remnant reactionaries infiltrating the interior. A deep review was also conducted on the different degrees of resistance to the united front policy. It is generally recognized that our cadres have certain shortcomings in policy implementation and work style, which have created a serious situation of being divorced from the masses and falling into a passive position. We must consolidate the people's democratic united front, and draw the boundary of unity to the foot of the three enemies—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—in order to isolate the enemy, strengthen ourselves, and concentrate our forces to fight the enemy.
            Improved policy and ideological level, overcome blindness and one-sidedness
    The rectification meetings in various localities have clarified the boundaries between correct and incorrect policy implementation, and improved the level of policy thinking. What should be promoted and what should be opposed in policy implementation have been reviewed based on actual work situations. At the Henan Provincial Party Representative Meeting, when discussing the preservation of the rich peasant economy, ideological resistance was initially widespread. Later, after understanding the principles, it was felt that economic problems could not be solved in practice. Finally, after conducting comparative research on the land relations in various localities, specific methods for preserving the rich peasant economy were proposed, which finally improved the understanding of this policy. Some confused ideas that still commonly exist among cadres, such as "left is better than right," "illegal is better than legal," "left is a firm position," "doing wrong is still for the masses"... have all been criticized at the rectification meetings in various localities. Many cadres said, "It won't work to rely solely on loyalty; you must also learn new skills." The idea of opposing policy implementation to mobilizing the masses, and wanting only the masses and not the policy, has been deeply reviewed based on the historical experience of the Chinese revolution and the actual situation of current work. Many comrades had explained their violations of policy as "the demands of the peasants," reducing the party's leadership role to the level of the peasants, and leading the peasant movement with peasant views. Such erroneous thinking has also been criticized. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting further reviewed the blindness in policy implementation, believing that insufficient research on the central government's policy documents and the lack of good policy education for general cadres below were the main reasons for certain deviations in policy implementation. At the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Rectification Meeting, it was found that many cadres had a great deal of one-sidedness in their understanding of policies, such as thinking that relying on poor and lower-middle peasants would disregard the united front, and that satisfying the demands of poor and lower-middle peasants was contradictory to developing production. The meeting first conducted repeated discussions on policy issues, pointing out that this one-sidedness in thinking was a reflection of the narrowness of peasant consciousness within the party.
            Expose bureaucratism and commandism, recognize the necessity of following the mass line
    The rectification meetings in various localities exposed bureaucratism and commandism, recognized their serious harmful nature to the people, clarified the boundaries between good and bad work styles, and recognized that only by following the mass line is it the only correct way to complete tasks. The rectification meetings in various localities have found that commandism is the main shortcoming in work style, and its particularly bad form is random beatings and arrests and the use of various disguised forms of corporal punishment. This is a reflection of the bad ideas and work styles of the feudal ruling class within our party. In the Yichang area, 75 cadres personally beat people, including 22 old cadres and 53 new cadres. They also had a theory for beating people. The district party secretary of Xiannv District in Zhijiang said, "In order not to make big mistakes, you have to make small mistakes." Some comrades even said, "Beating people is class indignation." In many cases, random beatings and arrests have exceeded the scope of commandism and are acts of domineering and violating laws and regulations. The Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Enlarged Meeting pointed out that commandism in work is inseparable from bureaucratism in leadership. For example, in the collection of public grain, the provincial party committee did not make appropriate resolutions on the contradictions between tasks and policies based on specific circumstances, but only abstractly insisted on both completing the tasks and implementing the policies, which increased the difficulties in the actual work below and fueled the commandist work style. At the Henan Provincial Party Committee Rectification Meeting, when reviewing leadership methods and work style, it was proposed that the commandist work style of using coercive methods to complete tasks without persuasion should be overthrown; the irresponsible bureaucratic work style and the tendency to corruption should also be overthrown. What should be developed is a democratic work style that takes the mass line with investigation and research. According to the review of the meeting, the following shortcomings exist in the leadership methods of the Henan Provincial Party Committee: First, insufficient foresight, and failure to prevent possible deviations in advance when correcting deviations, or insufficient and ineffective prevention. Second, advanced experiences are often used to guide general areas, thus neglecting backward areas. Third, various instructions lack inspiration, and the specific steps are stipulated too rigidly. The environment below is complex, there are few cadres, and the tasks are heavy, so they cannot be flexibly grasped and feel passive and strained. Fourth, there are many cadres above and many meetings, and there are few cadres below and many things to do, and a group of cadres often go to the top to attend meetings, "and after the meeting is over, the central work has also passed." Some comrades said, "There are thousands of threads at the top, three heads and six arms in the middle, and single acts at the bottom." Hubei also has this phenomenon. A district often receives more than a dozen instructions and hundreds of survey forms from above at the same time, which is very busy.
            Fully mobilize and make inspirational reports, break down ideological obstacles to the rectification movement
    Judging from the rectification situation in various localities, the general party member cadres have a high enthusiasm for rectification and study. In ordinary work, they are constantly reviewing their work and rectifying their thinking. They are even more eager to use this rectification to more comprehensively and deeply review their work, examine themselves, and improve their ideological and political level and work ability. However, a small number of party member cadres still do not have enough understanding of rectification and have produced a kind of blind and passive resistance. Some old cadres said, "Just rectify it, anyway, it's this old life!" "It's been rectified many times, and there's nothing more to rectify." Some cadres with more shortcomings said, "The new district is large and the tasks are heavy, who wouldn't make a few mistakes!" Some cadres are also afraid of being punished, saying, "If I am punished, there is no hope." Cadres below the county level believe that this rectification is mainly for cadres above the county level and has nothing to do with them. Some cadres also feel that they are not responsible for leadership and do not have bureaucratism and commandism, and there is nothing to rectify. Some cadres also have a wait-and-see attitude towards rectification, and decide their attitude towards rectification based on how the leaders rectify. These erroneous attitudes are the main ideological obstacles to carrying out the rectification movement. The effective way to break down this ideological obstacle is: First, there must be full mobilization for the rectification movement, and the purpose, focus, and methods of rectification must be clearly explained in the mobilization report, especially the purpose of rectification must be very clear. Second, leading cadres should make inspirational work review reports and conduct sincere self-criticism, so that cadres below can be bolder and more modest in their review. Third, in reviewing work, do not focus on individual trivial "organizational conclusions." Otherwise, it will not only distract the energy to solve major problems, but also hinder the true consciousness of cadres' thinking. For example, in the rectification of the Xingmei Prefectural Party Committee in Guangdong, insufficient preparations were made in advance, and the leaders did not make an analytical, substantive, and inspiring review; and the rectification training class run by the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee emphasized personal reflection and made appraisals by the organization one by one; this situation has caused more confusion in the thinking of cadres and made it impossible for rectification and study to proceed smoothly.
            Should be based on the guidelines instructed by Chairman Mao, gradually improve the ideological awareness of party member cadres
    The experience of rectification meetings in various localities proves that, in terms of rectification methods, we should follow the guidelines put forward by Chairman Mao in the report of the Third Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the CPC, that is, "to carry out a large-scale rectification movement under the conditions of close integration with various work tasks rather than separation, and to improve the ideological level and political level of cadres and general party members by reading certain designated documents, summarizing work, analyzing the situation, and developing criticism and self-criticism." The most important purpose of rectification and study is to improve the political and ideological level of party member cadres, overcome the work style of bureaucratism and commandism, and strengthen the relationship between the party and the masses. Therefore, the general development process of rectification and study is also the process of self-transformation of party member cadres' thinking from blindness to consciousness, from error to correctness, and from division to unity. Improving policy thinking and rectifying work style both rely mainly on the gradual improvement of the ideological awareness of party member cadres and solving problems ideologically.
            Leading comrades should personally get involved, conduct with preparation and step by step
    In specific steps, it should be carried out from top to bottom with preparation and step by step. That is to say, it must start from reviewing leadership work, and leading comrades must personally get involved and make sincere self-criticism; it must be carried out level by level from the highest leading organ in the local area from top to bottom. The steps taken by each province are roughly like this. However, some places have not implemented this spirit. For example, after the Central Committee issued the rectification instructions, the Fuliang Prefectural Party Committee in Jiangxi hurriedly started rectification without any preparation, and rectified from the prefectural party committee to the district and township cadres in a short period of one month, and therefore did not solve the basic problems. Now the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee has rearranged it in order to carry it out level by level from top to bottom. Another example is that the Beijiang Prefectural Party Committee in Guangdong took a detour in the early stage of rectification because the steps were not clear, only rectifying the top but not the bottom. Although the Xingmei Prefectural Party Committee adopted the method of from top to bottom, it emphasized that there was no experience in rectification, and the prefectural party committee did not first make a work summary report to enlighten general cadres, so as to review the work more comprehensively and systematically; as a result, it could not grasp the central problems, and turned the rectification movement that should have been carried out on a large scale into a handicraft method.
            Should be closely combined with central work, systematically and comprehensively put forward problems
    In the discussion process, it should be closely combined with the current central work tasks, and the problems should be concentrated on the central work tasks for review. According to the experience of the Henan Provincial Party Committee Rectification Meeting, concentrating problems must come from the masses, so we must let everyone present materials and situations freely, and not be afraid of the wide range of materials and the deep pursuit of problems. However, leading comrades should consciously and naturally guide the review to the most prominent and main problems at present according to the development of the ideological awareness of general cadres, deeply analyze the nature of the problems, from shallow to deep, from the past to the future, distinguish between good and bad boundaries, carry forward the advantages, and criticize the shortcomings. But there are also places where this is not the case, relaxing the main problems and focusing on trivial problems; neither earnestly reviewing past work nor putting forward active improvement opinions for future work. As a result, the rectification meeting was reduced to formalism. For example, when the Xingmei Prefectural Party Committee in Guangdong reviewed the work style of bureaucratism and commandism, it did not combine it with the main work tasks, but circled around the supply problem, believing that "it is wrong to be responsible to the top only to commit bureaucratic errors, and it is wrong to be responsible to the bottom only to commit anarchism and indiscipline"; and how to overcome bureaucratism and commandism in rural work and take the mass line was not clearly resolved. Many rectification meetings in various counties of the Fuliang Prefectural Party Committee in Jiangxi did not grasp the central problems, but discussed personal life and relationships between men and women with great interest. At the rectification meeting in Wuyuan County, two days were spent on a comrade's life problems, but there was still no result. This situation is inseparable from the shortcomings of leading comrades not personally getting involved in seriously summarizing leadership work and putting forward problems more comprehensively and systematically. When deploying rectification, the leading cadres of the Xingmei Prefectural Party Committee did not personally get involved, but "first carried out the examination and summary of the individual work of each department, and then made a general summary," as a result, they themselves also "felt a greatest difficulty, that is, it is very difficult to grasp, very difficult to find the center from so many and so complex problems, and seek solutions."
            Oppose stubbornly studying the literal meaning of documents, oppose relaxing the study of documents
    In the process of rectification, we must conscientiously read the documents, understand the spirit and essence of the documents, and use the documents as weapons to review our work. General rectification meetings regard the study of documents as a stage of ideological brewing. Some rectification meetings also review their work while studying the documents. When ideological obstacles occurred and could not be deepened when reviewing their work, the Henan Provincial Party Committee Rectification Meeting turned back to read relevant documents, first thoroughly understanding the thinking in principle, and then analyzing and researching the actual work situation. In reading documents, we must oppose two deviations: one is not combining with actual work, but only stubbornly studying the literal meaning of the documents; the other is only burying our heads in reviewing our work and relaxing the study of documents. The result of both deviations is that they cannot be improved ideologically, nor can they solve practical problems.
            Should let go of democracy and develop criticism and self-criticism
    In the process of rectification, we should let go of democracy and fully develop criticism and self-criticism. First of all, leading comrades should make sincere self-criticism. Self-criticism must be realistic and take on the responsibilities that the leadership should bear. According to the experience of the Guibei District Party Committee Rectification Meeting, this self-criticism has the following benefits: First, it has an enlightening and demonstrative effect on the inspection work of party member cadres below; second, the scope of the inspection work has a focus, which is convenient for concentrating on problems in the discussion, so as to avoid circling around on trivial issues. Third, it can make the cadres below bold and modest in their work, and there is no need to worry about anything. At the same time, we must guarantee the complete freedom of general party member cadres to criticize. Criticism must not be suppressed, nor should any form of coercion be adopted to force personal reflection. In the early stage of rectification, the Beijiang Prefectural Party Committee in Guangdong only rectified the lower level but not the upper level, and forced personal reflection. The original intention was to solve the problem of disunity between local cadres and foreign cadres, but the result was to further fuel the phenomenon of disunity. In addition, many old cadres have a fairly serious idea of ​​considering themselves meritorious officials, and have emotions of gains and losses, and therefore cannot face their own shortcomings and errors squarely. Breaking through this point is an important key to developing criticism and self-criticism.
    In order to carry out the rectification movement of party member cadres in the entire Central South Region in a more step-by-step, guided, and planned manner, the Central South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has designated a special person to form a special agency under the direct leadership of the Standing Committee, whose main task is to inspect the rectification movement in various localities. Recently, it has completed the review of the rectification plans in various localities, and will send people to various localities for on-site inspection and inspection soon.

　　中南区开始大规模整风
    主要方式是召开整风会和举办轮训班
    中心内容是检查工作和准备实行土改
    【本报讯】本报特约记者熊复报道：中南区中共党员干部的整风运动，现已大规模地开始。初步情况显示：各地一般都能掌握正确的整风精神，因而收到了良好的效果。也有某些地区的领导干部对整风精神体会不够，走了一些弯路。
    这次整风是在全国胜利和工作繁忙的条件下进行的；同时中南区还缺乏正规的党校系统，在职干部学习虽有成绩但机构还不健全。所以，中南区整风的主要方式是召开整风会（其形式又为党代表会议）和举办轮训班。各省的共同步骤都是自上而下，先由省委召开县委书记以上的党代表会，然后由地委召开区委书记以上的党代表会，同时由县委举办区乡一般党员干部的轮训班。
    河南省委召开的党代表会，已于七月二十六日结束。湖北省委和江西省委召开的党代表会，已于八月一日开始，现正进行中。在此以前，湖北和江西均有少数地委召开整风会或举办轮训班。江西省委并曾于七月间召开省委扩大会议，检查省委的领导工作。湖南省委原定八月一日召开党代表会，后因集中全力领导救灾，决定延期举行。广西省委因交通不便，仅于七月间召开地委书记联席会议。广东则在华南分局直接领导下，以地委为单位进行整风，各地委均已在六七月份先后开始。估计全中南大部地区可于九月间将整风运动推及到县区两级的一般党员干部。
    中南区今冬明春将有五千万人口地区实行土地改革，这次整风就是准备土改的重大步骤。整风会和轮训班的主要内容，在农村工作方面就是学习与检查实行减租和准备土改的政策和工作作风。整风会的一般方法是先传达三中全会决议，再由各级领导同志就工作任务和党内倾向提出工作总结报告，然后辅以整风文件的学习，联系政策思想和工作作风，在干部中进行批评与自我批评。
    各地整风会一般都是根据文件精神，从检查工作、分析情况入手，正确估计了解放以来领导群众运动的成绩，同时也揭露了过去工作上的严重缺点和错误。
            更清醒地认识国内形势  必须团结内部战胜敌人
    各地整风会的一般收获，首先是对革命胜利后的国内局势有了更清醒的认识。过去因全国胜利和一时一地工作成绩所引起的骄傲自满情绪，受到了批判。大家一方面更清楚地认识了人民民主力量的强大，加强和坚定了胜利信心；另一方面也都认识到对当前的困难要有充分的估计，对帝国主义组织和指挥国民党残余反动力量潜入内部进行破坏活动，要提高警惕。对于在统一战线政策问题上发生的程度不同的抵触情绪，也进行了深刻的检讨。普遍认识到：我们干部在政策执行上和工作作风上有某些缺点，造成了脱离群众，陷于被动的严重情势。必须巩固人民民主统一战线，把团结的界限划到三个敌人——帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的脚跟前，以便孤立敌人，壮大自己，集中力量和敌人进行斗争。
            提高了政策思想水平  克服盲目性和片面性
    各地整风会上划清了政策执行中的正确与不正确的界限，提高了政策思想水平。在政策执行上应该提倡什么，反对什么，都根据实际工作情况进行了检讨。河南省党代表会上讨论保存富农经济时，起初普遍发生思想抵触。以后从原则上想通了，又在经济上觉得解决不了实际问题。最后经过对各地土地关系的情况进行比较研究，提出了保存富农经济的具体办法，才在最后提高了对这一政策的认识。至今还在干部中普遍存在的某些糊涂思想，如“左比右好”，“非法比合法好”，“左是立场稳”，“做错了还是为了群众”……，都在各地整风会上受到了批判。许多干部都说：“光靠忠心耿耿吃不开，还须学会新本领。”把执行政策和发动群众对立起来，只要群众不要政策的思想，根据中国革命的历史经验和当前工作的实际情况，作了比较深刻的检讨。许多同志曾把自己违反政策的行为解释为“农民的要求”，把党的领导作用降低到农民的水平，用农民观点去领导农民运动。这样的错误思想也受到了批判。江西省委扩大会议更就执行政策上的盲目性进行了检讨，认为平常对中央的政策文件研究不够，对下面一般干部也没有很好地进行政策教育，是执行政策上发生某些偏差的主要原因。湖北省委整风会上，发现许多干部对政策的认识有很大的片面性，如认为依靠贫雇农就顾不到统一战线，满足贫雇农要求和发展生产有矛盾。会上首先就政策问题进行了反复讨论，指出这种思想方法上的片面性是农民意识的狭隘性在党内的反映。
            揭发官僚主义命令主义  认清了必须走群众路线
    各地整风会上揭发了官僚主义和命令主义，认清了它们对人民的严重危害性质，划清了工作作风上的好坏界限，认清了只有走群众路线才是完成任务的唯一正确方法。各地整风会上都发现命令主义是作风上的主要缺点，而其特别恶劣的形式又是乱打乱捕和施用各种变相肉刑。这是封建统治阶级的恶劣思想和作风在我们党内的反映。宜昌地区干部亲自打过人的有七十五人，其中老干部二十二人，新干部五十三人。他们打人还有一套理论。枝江仙女区区委书记说：“为了不犯大错误，就得犯个小错误。”有的同志还说：“打人是阶级义愤。”许多场合，乱打乱捕，已经超过命令主义范围，而是横行霸道，违法乱纪。江西省委扩大会议指出，工作中的命令主义是和领导上的官僚主义分不开的。如在公粮征收上，省委没有根据具体情况对任务和政策之间发生的矛盾作恰当的解决，只是抽象地坚持又要完成任务、又要执行政策，增加了下面实际工作的困难，助长了命令主义作风。河南省委整风会上，在检讨领导方法和工作作风时，提出：不用说服方法而用强制方法来完成任务的命令主义作风，应该打倒；不负责任的官僚主义作风和贪污腐化倾向也应该打倒。应该发展的是有调查研究的走群众路线的民主作风。在河南省委的领导方法上，根据大会的检讨，有以下的缺点：第一，预见性不够，纠正偏向时对可能发生的偏向没有事先防止，或防止得不够及时有力。第二，往往拿先进的经验指导一般地区，因而对落后地区照顾不够。第三，各种指示缺乏启发性，把具体步骤规定得太死，下面环境复杂，干部少，任务又重，不能灵活掌握，感到被动和吃力。第四，上边干部多，会议多，下面干部少，事又繁，时常有一批干部到上边开会，“会开完了，中心工作也过去了”。有的同志说：“上边千头万绪，中间三头六臂，下边唱独脚戏。”湖北也有这种现象，一个区往往同时接到上面十几种指示，上百种的调查表格，忙得要死。
            充分动员并作启发性报告  打破整风运动的思想障碍
    从各地整风情况来看，一般党员干部对整风学习的情绪是高涨的。平常在工作中本来就不断在进行检查工作和整顿思想。他们更热切盼望从这次整风中，能更全面更深入地检查工作，检查自己，提高自己的思想政治水平和工作能力。但少数党员干部中，对整风的认识还很不够，产生一种盲目的消极抵抗情绪。有的老干部说：“整就整吧，反正是这条老命！”“整了多次了，再也没啥整头了。”有的缺点较多的干部说：“新区地方大，任务重，谁还不犯点错误！”还有的干部怕受处分，说：“受了处分，就没有希望了。”县级以下干部认为这次整风主要是整县级以上干部，与自己无关。也有干部觉得自己不负领导责任，没有官僚主义和命令主义，没有什么好整。还有的干部对整风存观望心理，看领导上整得怎样才决定自己的整风态度。这些错误的态度，是开展整风运动的主要思想障碍。打破这层思想障碍的有效办法是：第一，对整风运动要作充分的动员，在动员报告中要把整风的目的、重点、方法讲清楚，尤其整风的目的要提得很明确。第二，领导干部要作启发性的工作检讨报告，进行恳切的自我批评，这样就可以使下面干部在检讨时更大胆而虚心。第三，在检查工作中，不要着重个人的琐碎的“组织结论”。不然，不但分散解决主要问题的精力，而且妨碍干部思想的真正自觉。如广东兴梅地委的整风，事前准备不够，领导上又未作出有分析有内容有启发意义的检讨；又如广西省委办的整风训练班，强调个人反省，由组织上一个一个地作鉴定；这种情况都造成了干部思想的更加混乱，使整风学习不能顺利进行。
            应当依据毛主席指示的方针  逐步提高党员干部思想觉悟
    各地整风会的经验都证明，在整风方法上，应依据毛主席在三中全会报告中提出来的方针，即“在和各项工作任务密切地相结合而不是相分离的条件之下，进行一次大规模的整风运动，用阅读若干指定文件，总结工作，分析情况，展开批评与自我批评等项方法，提高干部和一般党员的思想水平和政治水平”。整风学习最主要的目的是提高党员干部的政治思想水平，克服官僚主义、命令主义的作风，密切党和群众的关系。因此，整风学习的一般发展过程，也就是党员干部思想由盲目到自觉、由错误到正确、由分歧到统一的自我改造过程。提高政策思想也好，整顿作风也好，主要依靠党员干部的思想觉悟逐步提高，从思想上解决问题。
            领导同志应当亲自下手  有准备地有步骤地进行
    在具体步骤上，应当自上而下有准备有步骤地进行。这就是说，要从检查领导工作开始，要领导同志亲自下手，作出恳切的自我批评；要从当地最高领导机关自上而下逐级进行。各省采取的步骤大体上都是这样的。但也有的地方没有贯彻这一精神。如江西浮梁地委在中央颁布整风指示后，即忽忙地毫无准备地开始整风，在短短一个月内即由地委整到区乡干部，因而没有解决基本问题。现江西省委已重新布置，以便从上而下逐级进行。又如广东北江地委在整风初期，由于步骤不明确，只整上不整下，走了一段弯路。兴梅地委虽采取自上而下的办法，但强调整风没有经验，地委没有先作工作总结报告，来启发一般干部，以便更全面更有系统地检查工作；结果掌握不住中心问题，使应该大规模进行的整风运动变成手工业的方式。
            应当紧密结合中心工作  系统地全面地提出问题
    在讨论过程中，应当紧密结合当前中心工作任务，在中心工作任务上把问题集中起来进行检查。根据河南省委整风会的经验，集中问题必须从群众中来，因此必须放手让大家摆材料、摆情况，材料不怕摆的宽，问题不怕追的深。但领导同志要根据一般干部思想觉悟的发展，有意识地自然而然地把检讨引导到当前最突出最主要问题上来，深刻分析问题的性质，由浅入深，由过去到今后，分清好坏界线，发扬优点，批判缺点。但也有的地方不是这样，放松主要问题，偏重枝节问题；既未认真检讨过去工作，又未对今后工作提出积极的改进意见。因而使整风会流于形式主义。如广东兴梅地委在检讨官僚主义命令主义作风时，即未结合主要工作任务，而在供给问题上兜圈子，认为“光对上面负责要犯官僚主义的错误，光对下面负责又要犯无政府无纪律的错误”；而对于如何在农村工作中克服官僚主义、命令主义而走群众路线，则未明确的解决。江西浮梁地委各县的许多整风会都未抓住中心问题，反而在个人生活和男女关系上讨论得津津有味。婺源县整风会上对一个同志的生活问题开了两天会，仍然没有结果。这种情况是和领导同志没有亲自动手认真总结领导工作、较全面较系统地提出问题这一缺点分不开的。兴梅地委在布置整风时，领导干部就没有亲自动手，而是“先由各个部门各个个人的片断的个别的工作进行检查总结，然后再作总的总结，”结果使他们自己也“感到一个最大困难，就是很难掌握，很难从那么多那么复杂的问题中找到中心，求得解决”。
            反对死啃文件字句  反对放松学习文件
    在整风过程中，必须认真阅读文件，领会文件的精神和实质，把文件当作武器来检查工作。一般整风会是把学习文件当作思想酝酿的阶段来进行。也有的整风会，一边检查工作，一边学习文件。河南省委整风会在检查工作时发生思想障碍不能深入时，又回头阅读有关文件，先在原则上搞通思想，然后再就实际工作情况进行分析研究。在阅读文件上，要反对两种偏向：一种是不结合实际工作，只是死啃文件字句；另一种是只埋头检查工作，而放松学习文件。两种偏向的结果都不能在思想上有所提高，也不能解决实际问题。
            应当放手发扬民主  开展批评自我批评
    在整风过程中，应当放手发扬民主，充分开展批评与自我批评。首先，领导同志要作恳切的自我批评。自我批评又必须是实事求是的，把领导上应该负的责任担起来。这种自我批评，据桂北区党委整风会经验，有以下好处：第一，对下面党员干部的检查工作，有启发和示范的作用；第二，检查工作的范围有重点，便于在讨论中集中问题，以免在枝节问题上打圈子。第三，可以使下面干部们检查工作时大胆而虚心，不致有所顾虑。同时，要保证一般党员干部进行批评的完全自由。不能压制批评，也不应采任何形式的强迫办法，逼迫个人反省。广东北江地委在整风初期，既只整下不整上，又强迫个人反省。本来想解决本地干部和外来干部之间的不团结问题，结果反而更加助长了不团结现象。此外，许多老干部以功臣自居的思想相当严重，并有患得患失情绪，因而不能正视自己的缺点和错误。突破这一点，是开展批评与自我批评的重要关键。
    中共中央中南局为更有步骤、有领导、有计划地开展中南全区党员干部的整风运动，已在常委直接领导之下，指定专人组成一个专门机构，其主要任务是检查各地整风运动。最近已将各地整风的计划审核完毕，即将派人到各地进行实地检查和巡视。
