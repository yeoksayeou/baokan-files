　　Yanbian Korean People Greet National Day
    Sign Petition to Chairman Mao to Express Gratitude
    [This Dispatch from Yanji] All sectors of the Korean people in Yanbian are greeting the first National Day of the People's Republic of China by launching an enthusiastic signature campaign to express their heartfelt love and gratitude to Chairman Mao, who brought them freedom and a happy life. The signature campaign is currently being enthusiastically carried out in various organs and organizations such as the Yanbian Prefectural Committee, the Commissioner's Office, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Yanbian Women's Federation, the Communist Youth League, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in Yanji City. Every signatory wrote their name on the signature book with unparalleled enthusiasm, expressing their commitment to actively participate in the construction of the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party forever. According to statistics on September 15, in Yanji City alone, in Victory Street, Central Park, and Henan and Korean Streets, more than 5,200 people had signed. In the five villages in the suburbs of the city, including Gonghua and Longhe, 1,200 people signed in one hour on the evening of September 12. Moreover, during the signature symposiums, when discussing Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the Chinese Communist Party's policy towards ethnic minorities, the enthusiastic speeches were filled with unparalleled admiration and praise. It was expressed that the Korean people, as one of the ethnic minorities in Northeast China, can only continue their happy and joyful life under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party. As Jin Yunshan, an old farmer from Longhe Village, said: "I was given land after liberation, and now two of my sons are studying at universities and middle schools. I will never forget Chairman Mao. On this National Day, I will work harder to produce more to repay Chairman Mao."
    Among the Korean workers in factories, the upsurge of signing to thank Chairman Mao is even higher. When the Yanji Municipal Factory was summing up the factory's first red flag production competition on the 15th, more than 50 Korean workers, upon receiving the news that they were to sign to express their gratitude to Chairman Mao, proposed one after another: "In the future, we must continue to work hard in the second competition and strive to make greater production achievements to repay Chairman Mao." Jin Chenglong, a young worker who won the title of production model in the first competition, said: "I am determined to continue to strive for the model and strive for the red flag as a gift to Chairman Mao."
    In addition, Yanbian counties, rural areas, and small towns, which are enjoying a bumper harvest this year and are starting autumn harvesting, are also successively and enthusiastically launching signatures, so that the signature campaign to thank Chairman Mao being carried out among the Korean people in Yanbian is more widely and deeply reaching all levels of the Korean masses.

　　延边朝鲜族人民迎接国庆
    签名上书毛主席表示感谢
    【本报延吉讯】全延边朝鲜民族各阶层人民迎接中华人民共和国成立后的第一个国庆日，展开热烈的签名运动，向给他们带来自由和幸福生活的毛主席表示衷心的热爱和感谢。现签名运动，正在延吉市延边地委、专署、市工会、延边妇联会、青年团及中苏友协等各机关团体中热烈开展中。每一个签名者都以无比的热忱，在签名簿上写下了自己的名字，表示永远在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下，积极参加新中国的各项建设工作。据九月十五日统计：延市仅胜利、中央公园及河南、朝鲜等街，即已有五千二百余人签名。市郊工化、龙河等五村，九月十二日晚上一小时内，就有一千二百人签名。又在签名座谈会中，谈到毛主席的英明领导及中国共产党的少数民族政策时，在接二连三踊跃的发言中，除充溢着无比的仰慕和赞扬外，并表示：作为东北少数民族之一的朝鲜族人民只有在毛主席和中国共产党的领导下才能继续其幸福愉快的生活。如龙河村一老农民金云山说：“我自解放后分到了土地，现在有两个儿子已在大学和中学念书，真是叫我何时也忘不了毛主席。在迎接国庆日的今天，我要用加倍努力生产来报答毛主席。”
    在工厂的朝鲜工友中，签名向毛主席致谢的热潮更加高涨。延吉市营工厂，正当十五日总结该厂第一次生产红旗竞赛时，五十多名朝鲜族工人，接到要签名向毛主席表示感谢的消息，纷纷提出：“今后要继续努力在第二次竞赛中，争取做出更大的生产成绩来报答毛主席。”在第一次竞赛中荣获生产模范的青工金成龙说：“我决心继续以争取模范、争取红旗来作为向毛主席的献礼。”
    此外，今年欣逢丰收，正在着手秋收的延边各县、农村及小城镇，也正相继热烈地展开签名，使在延边朝鲜民族中开展着的向毛主席致谢的签名运动，更广泛深入到朝鲜民族各阶层群众中去。
